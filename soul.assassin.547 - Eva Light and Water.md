### Chapter 1 The Assignment  
Chapter 1 任务

_"Yes. This is her birthplace... Light and Water, makes up Rei's unfathomable personality  
_“是的。这里是她的出生地……光与水，构成了丽难以捉摸的性格”  
and thus reflects the atmosphere and the very nature of this place..."  
也因此反映了此地的氛围与本质……"

- **Doctor Ritsuko Akagi**

It was raining incessantly as the darkening storm raged over the German city of Dresden. The heavy deluge assaulted the rooftops as well as the umbrellas of its citizens. Thunder and lightning roared and flashed in the sky above, sending frightened little children scurrying to their mothers' laps and arms, sheltered in their homes all over the city.  
暴雨如注，黑暗的风暴在德国德累斯顿市上空肆虐。滂沱大雨袭击了屋顶和市民的雨伞。雷鸣电闪在天空轰鸣闪烁，吓得小孩子们纷纷跑向母亲的怀抱，躲在全市各处的家中。

The city has seen its share of history, including World War Two, when the city's once beautiful historical buildings and treasures were destroyed by Allied incendiaries to punish the Nazis. It was rebuilt, but endured the communist takeover when it became part of the eastern half of Germany. Only after reunification did a degree of prosperity allowed Dresden to regain some of its former glory.  
这座城市见证了它的历史，包括二战期间，当这座城市曾经美丽的历史建筑和珍宝被盟军的燃烧弹摧毁，以惩罚纳粹。它被重建，但经历了共产党的接管，成为东德的一部分。只有在统一之后，一定程度的繁荣才让德累斯顿恢复了一些昔日的辉煌。

But ten kilometers away from this city of heavy industry, in the deep forest and buried beneath the earth and solid rock about 600 meters below, it was the figurative calm before the storm.  
但在距离这座重工业城市十公里外的深林中，埋藏在地下约 600 米的坚固岩石之下，正是暴风雨前的宁静。

The storm of what SEELE would soon bring to NERV and its wayward leader.  
SEELE 即将对 NERV 及其桀骜不驯的领导者带来的风暴。

A young man was standing in the middle of a circle formed by twelve monoliths, not daring to move an inch in deference to his hosts. Behind him was a simple folding chair to sit on, once ordered to do so. He was their best ace for the final show, as Keel Lorenz looked upon him with great interest behind his imposing black monolith.  
一个年轻人站在由十二块巨石围成的圆圈中央，不敢移动分毫，以示对主人的尊敬。他身后有一把简单的折叠椅，曾被命令坐下。他是这场最终表演的最佳王牌，正如基尔·洛伦兹在他那令人敬畏的黑色巨石后饶有兴趣地注视着他。

"We are pleased to meet you, Kaworu Nagisa. Please be seated," SEELE 01 spoke out to the young man, who nodded rather pleasantly as he sat down on the chair. Fifteen years old, standing five-foot four and weighing less than a hundred pounds, Kaworu Nagisa had a mess of gray hair, bone-white skin and a slim frame of a body. However, his eyes, completely red and unblinking, matched the sharp intellect and philosophical wisdom that he possessed. Along with that demeanor, he was also very serene and understanding in attitude.  
“我们很高兴见到你，渚薰。请坐，”SEELE 01 对年轻人说道，他愉快地点点头，坐在了椅子上。十五岁，身高五英尺四英寸，体重不足一百磅，渚薰有着一头灰发，苍白的皮肤和纤细的身躯。然而，他那完全赤红且不眨眼的眼睛，与他所拥有的敏锐智慧和哲学智慧相匹配。除此之外，他的态度也非常平静和理解。

"Today is the day that you are ready to do something important for us. You have been prepared for this for so long as planned by the Committee. We have entrusted to you everything, even our hopes for bringing about the success of the Plan," Lorenz informed him.  
"今天是你准备好为我们做一件重要事情的日子。委员会按照计划已经为你准备了这么久。我们把一切都托付给你，甚至包括我们对于计划成功的希望，"洛伦兹告诉他。

Kaworu nodded silently, allowing Lorenz to continue to explain.  
渚薰默默地点头，让洛伦兹继续解释。

"You are assigned as the Fifth Children, to replace the Second Children because of unfortunate circumstances involving her, with the psychological attack by the 15th Angel. Do you understand?"  
"你被指派为第五适格者，以替代第二适格者，因为她不幸遭遇了第 15 使徒的心理攻击。你明白吗？"

"Yes, sir. I understand," Kaworu agreed.  
“是的，先生。我明白。”渚薰同意道。

"Indeed, the timing is impeccable."  
“确实，时机恰到好处。”

"If you have any doubts, I have no objections about being involved in this enterprise. In fact, I am not afraid to accomplish my duty, even if it's my life at stake. I simply have to consider the wishes of my brethren, and I finally understand that I have been preordained to correct the errors of many millennia."  
“如果你有任何疑虑，我并不反对参与这项事业。事实上，即使冒着生命危险，我也不怕履行我的职责。我只是必须考虑我同胞的意愿，最终我明白了我被预定为纠正无数世纪错误的人。”

"That is right," Keel agreed. "At this moment, they are at their weakest. They are barely able to win, and all is left for us is to gain an advantage."  
"没错，"基尔赞同道，"此刻他们最为虚弱。他们勉强能够取胜，而我们只需抓住机会取得优势。"

Kaworu nodded. "When I shall go, sir?"

"You will go at two in the morning, tomorrow, with an express flight to Tokyo-3. We have given you an entire week as well to complete your role. Now, is that clear?" Lorenz questioned.  
"你将在明日凌晨两点出发，搭乘直达东京-3 的航班。我们给了你整整一周的时间来完成你的任务。现在，清楚了吗？"洛伦兹询问道。"

Kaworu Nagisa stood up in attention and answered. "That will be done, sir."  
渚薰立即起身，肃立回答："一定完成，长官。"

"Finally, should you encounter any difficulty while you are there, you may request for assistance. Already we have prepared you some information concerning NERV and the Children."  
“最后，若你在那里遇到任何困难，可以请求援助。我们已经为你准备了一些关于 NERV 和孩子们的资料。”

Satisfied, Lorenz nodded in agreement with his words. "Very well, then. Do not fail us in any way, and accomplish all the objectives required of this organization. We will be completely satisfied once you have done your job dutifully. We bid you good luck, Mister Nagisa. You're dismissed for the day."  
洛伦兹满意地点头同意他的话。“很好，那么。不要以任何方式让我们失望，完成这个组织要求的所有目标。一旦你忠实地完成了你的工作，我们将完全满意。祝你好运，渚先生。你今天可以退下了。”

Kaworu nodded. "Thank you, sir. I will do my best," he answered before he pivoted and walked away.  
薰点头道：“谢谢您，先生。我会尽力的。”说完，他转身离开了。

After Kaworu left their gaze as he disappeared from the room, the twelve monoliths discussed what will be done with Supreme Commander Gendo Ikari and the organization under his command.  
在渚薰离开房间后，十二座巨碑开始讨论如何处置最高指挥官碇源堂及其指挥下的组织。

"In comparing his past actions to the directives the Committee has assigned him, we can clearly see that Ikari is defying us," SEELE 06 intoned.  
“将他的过往行为与委员会赋予他的指令相比较，我们可以清楚地看到，碇源堂正在违抗我们，”Seele 06 低沉地说道。

"Indeed, I am not pleased with his deviance from the scenario. Just look at his loss of the Lance against the 15th Angel," SEELE 03 seconded.  
“确实，我对他在剧本上的偏离感到不满。看看他在对抗第 15 使徒时丢失了朗基努斯之枪就知道了，”Seele 03 附和道。

"I agree. He has not been following the Committee's aims since the beginning, it would seem," SEELE 08 added. "We cannot tolerate his tendency of making decisions inimical to us."  
"我同意。他似乎从一开始就没有遵循委员会的目标，" SEELE 08 补充道。"我们不能容忍他做出对我们不利的决定。"

"These problems with Ikari would be enough. No more complaints about him any further from the each of you, gentlemen. We already know that he is clearly betraying our trust by using our plans for his own aims," SEELE 01 interrupted, thus causing them to shut up.  
"关于碇的问题已经够多了。各位，不要再对他有任何抱怨。我们都知道他明显在利用我们的计划实现自己的目标，这是对我们信任的背叛，" SEELE 01 打断道，让他们都闭上了嘴。"

Satisfied with the silence around him, SEELE 01 continued. "Very well, gentlemen. As part of our solution to accelerate our timetable, and we have the upper hand, with our resources ready to be utilized, it is time for the Final Messenger to bring the scenario to its next step as predicted in the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. Once his task is complete, we will be free to begin the Red Earth Purification Ceremony and bring about the Complementation of Man."  
对周围的沉默感到满意，SEELE 01 继续说道。"很好，先生们。作为加快我们时间表的解决方案，我们已经占据了优势，资源也已准备就绪，现在是时候让最后的使者按照《死海古卷》中的预言将情景推进到下一步。一旦他的任务完成，我们就可以自由地开始红土净化仪式，实现人类的补完。"

"Should our envoy fail, there will be no other choice for us but to exact punishment upon them," he concluded.  
“若使者失败，我们将别无选择，只能对他们施以惩罚。”他总结道。

The rest of the Committee echoed their agreement unanimously. "So be it, for the Complementation of Man!"  
委员会的其他成员一致表示同意。“就这样吧，为了人类的补全！”

And all the monoliths disappeared in unison, adjourning the meeting of the ancients.  
所有的石碑同时消失，古老的会议就此结束。

In the cover of the morning darkness, a convoy of unmarked, black-painted vehicles passed through the heavily-guarded gates of a nondescript military airbase, of Cold War Soviet vintage, twenty kilometers away from Dresden. They sped across the wide expanse of the tarmac towards a huge hangar big enough to accommodate a Boeing Seven Century hypersonic transport plane, which was parked inside. It was painted white with the letters "United Nations" emblazoned along its length.  
在清晨的黑暗掩护下，一队无标记的黑色涂装车辆穿过距离德累斯顿二十公里的一座冷战时期苏联风格的普通军事基地的重重守卫大门。它们疾驰在宽阔的停机坪上，向着一个足以容纳一架波音七世纪超音速运输机的大型机库驶去，这架飞机就停放在里面。它的机身被漆成白色，沿着长度方向上印有“联合国”的字样。

The hangar's massive doors parted to let in the convoy, before it closed together away from prying eyes once the vehicles were all inside.  
巨大的机库门缓缓分开，为车队让路，待所有车辆进入后，门又重新合拢，避开了窥探的目光。

Among the vehicles in the convoy, a heavily-armored Mercedes-Benz SUV stopped in front of the huge, sleek jet transport and its black-fatigue-clad occupants came out from the front doors. Armed with submachine guns, one of the disembarked men opened the rear passenger door to let Kaworu out.  
车队中的车辆之一，一辆装甲厚重的梅赛德斯-奔驰 SUV 停在了那架巨大而流线型的喷气式运输机前，身着黑色作战服的乘员们从前门下车。其中一名手持冲锋枪的男子打开了后座乘客门，让 Kaworu 下车。

Clutching his black duffel bag and an aluminum briefcase in both hands, Kaworu dutifully stepped out of the SUV and glanced briefly at the plane, before he walked up the stairs leading up to the hatch, escorted by a pair of severe, black-suited men.  
Kaworu 双手紧握着他的黑色旅行袋和一个铝制公文箱，恭敬地从 SUV 中走出，短暂地瞥了一眼飞机，然后在两名严肃的黑衣男子的陪同下，走上通往舱门的楼梯。

As he navigated the aisles to his assigned seat, Kaworu wondered why they would give him an airplane of this size just to ferry him to Japan. _Curious_, he mused. _Their gratitude must be excessive for me, but I must respect my guardian's wishes._  
当他穿过通道走向自己的座位时，渚薰不禁疑惑，为何他们要给他这样一架大型飞机，仅仅是为了送他去日本。他好奇地思索着。他们的感激之情必定是过分的，但我必须尊重监护人的意愿。

_What is important is that they needed this to be done, and I made my choice.  
重要的是，他们需要完成这件事，而我做出了选择。_

Now seated comfortably, Kaworu finally let himself rest as the sleek plane started up its powerful engines, moving away and out of the hangar towards the runway.  
现在舒适地坐下后，渚薰终于让自己放松下来，随着这架流线型的飞机启动强大的引擎，缓缓驶离机库，朝着跑道前进。

"Please buckle up your seatbelts. We will be flying out in a minute," the pilot announced over the intercom. Obediently Kaworu fastened his seatbelt and waited for the plane to take off.  
“请系好安全带。我们即将起飞。”飞行员通过广播宣布。Kaworu 顺从地系好安全带，等待飞机起飞。

After a minute or so of talking with the control tower, and lining with the runway, the pilot nudged the throttle to full blast, giving full power to the six General-Electric scramjets that allowed the plane to fly faster than the speed of sound as it quickly gained altitude over the German countryside, heading eastwards.  
与控制塔通话并调整好跑道位置后，飞行员将油门推至最大，六台通用电气公司生产的超燃冲压发动机全力运转，使飞机以超音速迅速攀升，飞越德国乡村，向东疾驰。

About two hours later and eight miles above the Earth in the stratosphere, Kaworu woke up from his slumber, and decided that he must have something to drink. He promptly asked permission from one of the armed agents as he walked up to them.  
大约两小时后，在距地面八英里的平流层中，Kaworu 从睡梦中醒来，决定需要喝点什么。他立即向一名武装特工请求许可，并走向他们。

"What is it?" the agent asked, after putting down an issue of _Time_ he was reading.  
"什么事？" 特工放下手中正在阅读的《时代》杂志问道。

"I would like to prepare tea for myself," Kaworu said.  
"我想自己泡杯茶，" 渚薰说。

The agent nodded. "No problem. The galley kitchen's up ahead," he answered, thumbing up Kaworu's way.  
特工点点头。"没问题。前面的厨房里有茶具，" 他用拇指指向渚薰的方向回答道。

"Thank you," Kaworu said, before he walked through the aisle all the way to the small kitchen.  
“谢谢，”渚薰说道，随后穿过通道一直走到那个小厨房。

While he prepared a cup of oolong tea on the Formica counter, he thought of what the Children looked like, as Keel explained once that all Evangelion pilots are required to be at least fourteen years of age, and a selection board was formed on purpose to seek and select potential candidates from any place on the planet.  
当他站在富美家（Formica）台面上准备一杯乌龙茶时，他想起了那些孩子们的样子，基尔曾经解释过，所有 EVA 驾驶员至少需要十四岁，并且特意成立了一个选拔委员会，在全球范围内寻找和挑选潜在候选人。

_I think they must be like me. No, maybe not. They are still frail humans. Lilim, after all, with their courage and fears, their individual loves and hates, despite everything that has been thrown at them. It would be good to find out who they are,_ he reflected.  
我想他们一定像我一样。不，也许不是。他们仍然是脆弱的人类。莉莉姆（Lilim），毕竟，尽管他们有着勇气和恐惧，个人的爱与恨，尽管经历了种种磨难。了解他们是谁，这将是件好事，他思索着。

Going back to his seat with his tea, Kaworu unlatched and folded out the table in front of him, placed the teacup in a holder, lit up the overhead reading lamp above him.  
回到座位上，手里端着茶，Kaworu 解开并展开了面前的折叠桌，将茶杯放入支架中，点亮了头顶的阅读灯。

But just about he was to take the first sip of his tea and get one of his favorite books, the _Divine Comedy_ of Dante Alighieri, from his briefcase, another agent came up to Kaworu, carrying a bulky manila envelope.  
但就在他准备喝第一口茶，并从公文包里拿出他最喜欢的《神曲》时，另一位特工走过来，手里拿着一个厚厚的马尼拉纸信封。

"Pardon me?" Kaworu spoke, putting down his tea back into the holder.  
“打扰一下？”Kaworu 说道，将茶杯放回支架中。

"They wanted to give this to you," the older man answered as he handed over to Kaworu the envelope, placing it on top of the tray.  
"他们想把这个交给你，"年长的男子边说边将信封递给渚，放在托盘上。

Kaworu nodded. "Thank you, sir," he whispered.  
渚点点头。"谢谢您，先生，"他轻声说道。

"It's my pleasure," the agent replied as he walked back into his place at the back of the plane.  
"乐意效劳，"那位特工回答着，走回他在飞机后部的位置。

Taking a breath, Kaworu opened the envelope, which it turned out to be carrying five folders, one folder for each item of importance:  
深吸一口气，渚薰打开了信封，里面装着五个文件夹，每个文件夹对应一项重要内容：

_NERV: The Organization and its Aims  
NERV：组织与其目标_  
_The Geofront_  
_The Evas (Unit-00 / Prototype Model to Unit-04 / Production Model)  
初号机（零号机/原型机至四号机/量产型）_  
_Historical Background 历史背景_  
_Personnel Profile Dossiers  
人员档案资料_

Each folder had a red stamping with the words "TOP SECRET. Destroy after Reading".  
每个文件夹上都盖有红色的印章，上面写着“绝密。阅后即毁”。

Taking out the first file from the envelope, Kaworu cracked open its pages to read, methodically committing the vital information to memory without jotting it down.  
从信封中取出第一份文件，渚薰翻开页面开始阅读，有条不紊地将关键信息牢记于心，并未做任何笔记。

Halfway with the third and fourth folder after two hours, with his understanding of the extensive technical details on the Evas, and NERV's general history, Kaworu got off his seat to make more tea in the kitchen with soda crackers to munch on, and then go back again to his business. Kaworu paused only to grab a pair of headphones to listen to some jazz music piped in, more precisely, with the music of Louis Armstrong. He had acquired a taste for music while being tutored on basic human culture, including entertainment and the arts.  
两小时后，处理到第三和第四个文件夹的一半时，对于 EVA 的详细技术资料和 NERV 的总体历史有了深入了解的渚薰，起身去厨房泡了更多的茶，顺便拿了些苏打饼干咀嚼，然后又回到座位继续工作。渚薰只停下来抓了一副耳机，播放了一些爵士乐，更确切地说，是路易斯·阿姆斯特朗的音乐。他在接受基础人类文化教育时，包括娱乐和艺术，培养了对音乐的品味。

An hour of that lively baritone from Armstrong had passed before Kaworu finally came up to the last folder, all containing the personal backgrounds of vital NERV members, complete with surveillance photos.  
阿姆斯特朗那充满活力的男中音播放了一个小时后，渚薰终于来到了最后一个文件夹，里面包含了 NERV 关键成员的个人背景资料，以及监视照片。

As he read, one page outlined the command structure, starting from Supreme Commander Ikari, to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, to Doctor Akagi and Major Katsuragi, to the bridge personnel, down to the Children. Without losing one figment of a fact about these characters, he memorized all of it until he got to the pages about the Children.  
当他阅读时，一页概述了指挥结构，从最高指挥官碇源堂开始，到副指挥官冬月，再到赤木律子博士和葛城美里少校，直至桥上人员，最后是孩子们。他一丝不苟地记住了这些角色的所有细节，直到翻到关于孩子们的页面。

_**The Children 孩子们**_

_1. Rei Ayanami_  
_2. Asuka Langley Souryu (x)  
2. 惣流·明日香·兰格雷（x）_  
_3. Shinji Ikari_  
_4. Toji Suzuhara (x)_

_(x) Recent intel update. See accompanying documents.  
(x) 最新情报更新。请参阅附件文件。_

_This will be very interesting_, Kaworu mused as he turned one page away, to reveal several surveillance pictures of Rei Ayanami, which showed her in several shots, leaving the ancient apartment of hers after breakfast, heading either to school or to the Geofront.  
这将会非常有趣，渚薰一边思索着，一边翻过一页，露出了几张关于绫波零的监视照片，照片显示她在早餐后离开她那古老的公寓，或是前往学校，或是前往地底都市。

Her appearance had taken Kaworu aback, blinking.  
她的外貌让渚薰吃了一惊，不禁眨了眨眼。

Putting down that picture on the table, Kaworu began reading the rest of the Ayanami file, which he found to be wanting in content, with only four scant paragraphs, the last denoting what happened to her and Eva-00, after facing off with the Angel of the Womb.  
将那张照片放在桌上，渚薰开始阅读其余的绫波文件，发现内容匮乏，仅包含四个简短段落，最后一段记述了她与零号机在面对子宫天使后的遭遇。

_It's quite a pity that there's little about Rei. It would be better off to meet her face to face instead of these pieces of paper that tells me nothing,_ he told himself.  
真可惜关于绫波的信息太少。与其通过这些纸张一无所知，不如亲自见她一面，他在心中暗想。

Kaworu plowed through the rest of the dossier, with the miserable background stories about the Second and the Third Children, as well as the uneventful early retirement given to Suzuhara after his near-death encounter, when the infected Unit-03 was slaughtered down by the infamous Test Type Unit-01.  
渚薰继续翻阅档案，其中包括了关于第二和第三适格者的悲惨背景故事，以及铃原在几乎丧命于被感染的三号机被臭名昭著的试验型初号机屠杀后的平淡退役。

With considerable interest, he stared at Rei's full figure in one of the pictures, dressed up in her customary junior-high school uniform and carrying a black leather school briefcase, showing her entering the school gates.  
他带着浓厚的兴趣，盯着一张照片中丽的全貌，她穿着惯常的初中校服，手提一只黑色皮革书包，正走进学校大门。

Kaworu sighed, wondering what kind of girl Rei Ayanami was. Judging from her passive face she displayed in the surveillance pictures, he figured out that she was still a living, breathing body, yet possessing what he believed was a troubled soul.  
渚薰叹了口气，思索着绫波丽究竟是怎样的女孩。从监控照片中她那冷漠的表情判断，他推测她仍是一个有血有肉的人，但内心似乎承载着他所认为的困扰灵魂。

Out of his memory, he recalled Goethe's Faust as he pocketed the picture into his jacket: _"Two souls, alas, are housed within my breast."_  
他脑海中浮现出歌德的《浮士德》，将照片揣进夹克口袋时，心中默念：“唉，我的胸中居住着两个灵魂。”

Two minutes later, the burnt remains of the secret documents trailed away from the supersonic plane, as it began to make its approach for Odawara International Airport, near Tokyo-3.  
两分钟后，秘密文件的烧焦残骸随着超音速飞机的接近，从空中飘散，它正准备降落在东京-3 附近的小田原国际机场。

---

Still beyond Kaworu's grasp, Rei Ayanami was preparing herself for her assigned tasks down at the Geofront this early morning.  
对于碇真嗣来说，仍然遥不可及的绫波零，在这个清晨正准备在 Geofront 执行她的任务。

Remembering nothing much of what happened to her predecessor, who killed herself along with Unit-00 in an explosion that took out half of Tokyo-3, Rei stepped out of the shower, clad in a towel, and walked to her bed. Laid out on the bed were her only clothes she wore, which was the school uniform ensemble and her white underwear. As for her plugsuit, it would be of no use anymore.  
对于前一任绫波零的遭遇，她几乎一无所知，那位绫波零与零号机一同自爆，摧毁了半个东京-3。绫波零走出淋浴间，裹着毛巾，走向她的床。床上摆放着她唯一的一套衣服，即校服套装和白色内衣。至于她的插入栓服，已经不再需要了。

Rei unfurled her towel from her body, before she began to put on her underwear, panties first and that C-size bra she snapped around her chest.  
丽从身上展开毛巾，然后开始穿上内衣，先穿内裤，再扣上那件 C 罩杯的胸罩，紧紧环绕在胸前。

As she went about dressing herself, Rei thought of her assigned tasks she had to do for today. Even now, she was always driven with a sense of purpose and duty, despite that there was no Eva to pilot, and no Dummy Plug for which she radiated her soul to her now-destroyed clones.  
在穿衣的过程中，丽想着今天分配给她的任务。即使现在没有 EVA 可驾驶，也没有 Dummy Plug 需要她将灵魂辐射给那些已被摧毁的克隆体，她始终保持着一种使命感和责任感。

_I still have a purpose, no matter what happens,_ she reminded herself.  
无论发生什么，我仍然有我的使命，她提醒自己。

At the moment, she knew that Ritsuko Akagi was spending her time in the Stockade, for destroying Rei's clones in the Dummy Plug Plant, while Asuka Langley Souryu was still in the infirmary, being treated for psychological trauma a week after the 15th Angel attacked her.  
此刻，她知道赤木律子正因在模拟插入栓工厂销毁绫波的克隆体而被关押在禁闭区，而惣流·明日香·兰格雷则仍在医务室接受心理创伤治疗，距离第 15 使徒袭击她已过去一周。

Rei also knew that her classmates had to evacuate the devastated city and the surrounding Hakone area, leaving nobody but core NERV personnel as its only inhabitants.  
绫波也清楚，她的同学们不得不撤离这座被毁的城市及周边的箱根地区，除了 NERV 的核心人员外，再无其他居民。

As for Shinji and Misato, she saw them yesterday, both of them somewhat distraught with what tragically happened to the others. It was also sad to know for Misato that Ryoji Kaji was murdered in cold blood three weeks ago, probably betrayed by an insider, while Shinji was unhappy to see Rei not able to remember anything about her last battle when he visited her at the infirmary a few days back.  
至于真嗣和美里，她昨天见过他们，两人都对发生的悲剧感到些许沮丧。对美里来说，得知三周前加持良治被冷血谋杀，很可能是被内部人背叛，同样令人难过；而真嗣则因几天前探望绫波时，她对上一场战斗的记忆全无而感到不快。

Perfectly dressed now, Rei went to her kitchen to prepare her austere breakfast of toast and garden salad, washed down with green tea, before going back to her bed where she ate.  
此刻打扮得无可挑剔，丽前往厨房准备她简朴的早餐：吐司和花园沙拉，佐以绿茶，随后回到床上享用。

While eating, Rei checked a piece of paper that listed today's activities. _Nothing much to do_, she thought, shaking her head, seeing that there was only one thing on that activity schedule that required her attention.  
用餐时，丽查看了一张列有今日活动的纸条。她摇摇头，心想没什么特别的事要做，因为活动安排上只有一项需要她关注。

Finally sated, Rei got up on her feet and went out to the world, locking the door to her dwelling first before she left.  
终于心满意足后，丽站起身来，走出家门，离开前不忘锁好门。

---

Walking alone, Rei could only look at the extent of destruction that was sordidly laid out across the city. Only a shallow crater lake remained, in place of the grandiose complex of tall buildings that once stood there. Elsewhere there were uprooted trees, bent traffic signs and huge piles of ferroconcrete and rock. It was more of a war zone.  
独自前行，丽只能凝视着城市中那片惨不忍睹的破坏景象。曾经宏伟的高楼群如今只剩下一个浅浅的陨石坑湖。其他地方则是连根拔起的树木、扭曲的交通标志和巨大的钢筋混凝土及岩石堆。这里更像是一个战区。

Unmindful of the billowing dust from the road, Rei noticed the remnants of life dotting the cityscape, such as the trees ringing the hillside and planted along the sidewalk, as well as the birds flying in the sky.  
丽并未在意道路上扬起的尘土，她注意到城市景观中点缀着生命的痕迹，比如环绕山坡的树木和沿人行道种植的绿植，以及天空中飞翔的鸟儿。

Finally, Rei approached the Geofront's gates, where a guard was standing there, ready to receive her.  
最终，丽走近了地底都市的入口，那里站着一名守卫，准备迎接她的到来。

"May I take your identification, please," the sentry reminded her.  
“请出示您的身份证件。”哨兵提醒她。

Dutifully, Rei took out her ID card and showed it to him. In approval, he let her go inside as she swiped the card in the reader installed into the turnstile, which allowed her through.  
丽依规规矩矩地拿出她的身份证，展示给他看。他点头同意后，她便在旋转门上的读卡器上刷了卡，顺利通过。

As she went to the line of elevators leading down to Headquarters, Rei glanced at her ID card and stared at it. There, her name, rank and serial number, plus her picture, all of it printed on that single piece of plastic, causing Rei to pause in her tracks and reflect hard.  
当她走向通往总部的电梯时，丽瞥了一眼自己的身份证，凝视着它。上面印着她的名字、军衔、编号以及照片，所有信息都浓缩在这张小小的塑料卡片上，让丽停下脚步，陷入沉思。

_Why am I here? Why am I still alive? Alive for what... and for whom I live for?_ She doubted herself, wondering about how and why she was still existing in this world.  
我为何在此？为何我还活着？活着为了什么...我又为谁而活？她怀疑自己，思索着她为何以及如何仍存在于这个世界。

For a minute she stood there, pondering about herself before Rei realized that she still had a job to do down below.  
她站在那里，沉思了一会儿，随后丽意识到她还有任务在楼下等着完成。

Just to meet with Commander Ikari in his office, on top of the pyramidal Headquarters building.  
只是为了在金字塔形总部大楼的顶层与碇司令在他的办公室会面。

---

"Good Morning, Commander," Rei greeted Gendo Ikari once they met in the office, heavily decorated with the reproduction of the Athanasius Kirchner Sephirotic System diagram on the ceiling, and a bubble chamber etching on the floor, while the huge bay windows offered a full view of the Geofront's expanse. Normally this sanctum sanctorum was bare, save for the Commander's desk, but for the purposes of today's upcoming meeting with the Fifth Children there were two tube-frame folding seats and a coffee table. The floor space alone was done on purpose to intimidate some guests, and to acknowledge Gendo's immense authority as the Commander of NERV.  
"早上好，指挥官，" 在办公室里，丽向碇源堂问候道。办公室的天花板上装饰着阿萨纳修斯·基尔舍纳的塞菲罗特系统图复制品，地板上则是气泡室蚀刻。巨大的落地窗提供了整个 Geofront 的广阔视野。通常这个圣所只有指挥官的办公桌，但为了今天与第五适格者的会议，这里摆放了两张管架折叠椅和一张咖啡桌。地板空间的布置有意用来震慑某些访客，并彰显碇源堂作为 NERV 指挥官的巨大权威。

Rei bowed deeply in respect before him.  
丽深深地鞠躬以示尊敬。

"Good Morning, Rei. I am very glad to see you again. Please, have a seat," Gendo answered as he fondly looked at her.  
"早上好，丽。很高兴再次见到你。请坐，" 碇源堂回答道，深情地看着她。

Of all the people Gendo encountered, he could absolutely count on Rei to entrust everything he knew and planned, other than Sub-Commander Kouzou Fuyutsuki, and by extension the only person he can show his emotions in private, so he smiled a little at her.  
在所有与源堂接触过的人中，他绝对可以信赖的，除了副司令官高雄冬月之外，就是绫波了。只有她，他能在私下里展露自己的情感，因此他向她微微一笑。

"Thank you, sir," Rei replied before she took her seat facing the Commander.  
“谢谢您，先生。”绫波回答后，便坐到了面对指挥官的位置上。

"Today, somebody very important would be arriving here as we speak," he informed.  
“今天，有一位非常重要的人物正在到来，”他告知。

Rei nodded in agreement as the Commander rose up from his seat and walked towards her with a folder in hand.  
丽点了点头表示同意，指挥官从座位上起身，手里拿着一个文件夹向她走来。

"Because of the Second Children's psychological trauma, it is necessary that we must have a good replacement for her. Fortunately, we have selected our new candidate for this role, and he's also from Germany," Gendo continued, before he handed to Rei a folder.  
“由于第二适格者的心理创伤，我们必须为她找到一个好的替代人选。幸运的是，我们已经选定了新的候选人，他同样来自德国。”源渡继续说道，然后将文件夹递给了丽。

She opened the folder to find a picture of Kaworu, his pale face with a Zen-like grin greeting her. Beneath his picture was his very short background information, which was limited to only two paragraphs of printed text. Only his date of birth was the most obvious—September 13, 2000—which was the same day the Second Impact nearly destroyed the human race.  
她打开文件夹，看到一张卡瓦鲁的照片，他苍白的脸上带着一种禅意的微笑迎接她。照片下面是他非常简短的背景信息，仅限于两段打印的文字。最显眼的是他的出生日期——2000 年 9 月 13 日——这一天，第二次冲击几乎毁灭了人类。

Certainly, from the looks of Kaworu's appearance, he closely resembled Rei in some aspects, especially with his cerise eyes, so it was understandable that Rei was slightly taken aback with his appearance.  
确实，从渚薰的外貌来看，他在某些方面与绫波零颇为相似，尤其是他那双深红色的眼睛，因此绫波零对他的出现感到些许惊讶是可以理解的。

_He is the Fifth Children? He looks like me... He is the same as with me,_ she thought, allowing the shock to register inwardly, and absolutely not on her face for Gendo to see.  
他就是第五适格者吗？他看起来像我……他和我一样，她心想，将震惊深藏心底，绝不让脸上的表情泄露半分给碇源堂看。

As if he was reading her mind, Gendo explained, "You don't have to worry. Kaworu Nagisa will be here for our purposes and for good reasons, Rei, so that there will be no deviation from what the Scrolls say. Do you have any other questions about the Fifth Children?"  
仿佛在读她的心思，碇源堂解释道：“你不必担心。渚薰来到这里是为了我们的目的和正当理由，绫波，这样就不会偏离《死海文书》所预言的内容。关于第五适格者，你还有什么问题吗？”

At that point, Rei looked up at Gendo simply shook her head.  
那一刻，丽抬头看着源度，只是摇了摇头。

Satisfied with her wordless response, Gendo nodded. "Very well, then. With nothing to stop us, we will be reaching our ultimate objective soon enough. Is it okay for you?"  
对她的无声回应感到满意，源度点了点头。“很好，那么。既然没有什么能阻止我们，我们很快就会达到最终目标。你没问题吧？”

"Yes, Commander. I always will be bound by my duty to serve as you require," Rei answered.  
“是的，指挥官。我将永远恪守职责，按照您的需要行事，”丽回答道。

Gendo nodded again, satisfied with her obedience. The last time she sacrificed herself, it was out of necessity and loyalty, but more importantly her behavior was altered over the last few months since his son's arrival. She was supposed to interact, but never to be affected by human activity.  
源度再次点头，对她的顺从感到满意。上次她牺牲自己，是出于必要和忠诚，但更重要的是，自从他儿子到来后的这几个月里，她的行为发生了改变。她本应与人互动，但绝不能被人际活动所影响。

Today, Rei's purity was enough for him to look forward to his next objective, yet lately a series of events nearly derailed his plans. Privately he was infuriated when Ritsuko destroyed one of his long-running pet projects, the Dummy Plug program, out of hatred; and then the impetuous Second Children was attacked by an Angel before suffering a severe case of depression leading to a suicide attempt.  
今天，绫波的纯洁足以让他期待下一个目标，但最近一系列事件几乎打乱了他的计划。私下里，他对律子出于仇恨毁掉了他长期运作的宠物项目——模拟插入栓程序——感到愤怒；而那个冲动的二号适格者则在遭遇使徒攻击后，陷入了严重的抑郁，甚至试图自杀。

Now he heard that his son is distraught at the moment, but he did not saw his Shinji as his flesh and blood, but only as a tool like others he manipulated to acquire what he truly wanted.  
现在他听说儿子此刻心烦意乱，但他并未将真嗣视为血脉至亲，而仅仅是一个像他操纵的其他工具一样，用来获取他真正想要的东西。

Gendo Ikari was a driven man, determined to defy fate, and Rei Ayanami was the last card in his sleeve.  
碇源堂是个有决心的人，决心要反抗命运，而绫波零是他最后的底牌。

By the time the supersonic plane touched down on the runway of Odawara International Airport, and then taxied near the group of hangars, a large number of heavily-armored vehicles were waiting to receive Kaworu as the plane came to a halt.  
当超音速飞机降落在小田原国际机场的跑道上，然后滑行至机库群附近时，一大批重装甲车辆已经准备好在飞机停稳时迎接渚薰。

Coming out of the aircraft's hatch, Kaworu glanced around his surroundings; before he looked down to see his escorts from Section Two waiting to protect him. Two dozen more of these NERV people, all dressed in Kevlar vests, were standing guard and toting submachine guns, as they surrounded the plane and the convoy vehicles.  
从飞机舱门出来，渚薰环顾了一下四周；然后低头看到第二分部的护卫们正等着保护他。还有两打这些 NERV 的人员，全都穿着凯夫拉尔背心，手持冲锋枪，围绕着飞机和车队车辆站岗。

Kaworu let one of the Section Two agents carry his two pieces of luggage. "Place it in the back," he commanded.  
渚薰让第二支部的一名特工帮他提着两个行李箱。“放在后面，”他命令道。

"Okay," the beefy-looking agent answered, as he carefully placed the duffel bag and the briefcase at the back of the black, armored NERV-issued Chevrolet Suburban, before Kaworu and the other agents boarded in and the convoy quickly rolled out.  
“好的，”那位看起来健壮的特工回答，小心翼翼地将旅行袋和公文包放在黑色装甲的 NERV 配发雪佛兰萨博班的后部，随后渚薰和其他特工上车，车队迅速驶离。

On their way through Route 1, Kaworu watched to see the scenery change, from a series of concrete tunnels and grassy hills, to reveal the devastated city of Tokyo-3 itself. Indeed, there was little left in the center of the city, which was now a lake ringed by ruins.  
在途经 1 号公路时，渚薰观察着风景的变化，从一系列混凝土隧道和草地丘陵，逐渐展现出被毁坏的第三新东京市本身。确实，市中心几乎已荡然无存，如今只剩下一个被废墟环绕的湖泊。

_Ah, how disappointing it looks for a city of this size, with so much destruction. But it's never a city in the truest sense of the word, but more of a fortress of deception,_ Kaworu reflected.  
啊，这么大的城市，却满目疮痍，真是令人失望。但这从来不是一个真正意义上的城市，而更像是一个欺骗的堡垒，渚薰思忖着。

_Then what are they hiding inside? I'll have to see for myself, as it'll be futile for the Lilim to conceal it.  
那么他们在里面隐藏了什么？我必须亲自去看看，因为人类想要隐瞒是徒劳的。_

One of the Section Two agents in the front seat spoke out, removing Kaworu from his reverie. "I have something to give to you. It's a message from Commander Ikari," he informed as he handed to Kaworu an envelope.  
前排座位上的第二支部特工之一打破了渚薰的沉思，说道：“我有东西要给你。这是碇司令的信。”他一边说，一边递给渚薰一个信封。

"Thank you," Kaworu answered, before he opened the envelope containing a letter, which was a simple message of welcome.  
“谢谢，”渚薰答道，随后打开了装有信件的信封，里面是一封简短的欢迎信。

_Indeed,_ Kaworu told himself as he pocketed the envelope into his jacket. _He's waiting for me to do what's in the Scrolls._  
确实，渚薰将信封塞进夹克口袋时自言自语。他在等我按照卷轴上的指示行事。

### Chapter 2 At First Sight  
Chapter 2 一见倾心

Five kilometers away from the Geofront, Misato Katsuragi was spending her time at a roadside eatery after finishing her early lunch, patiently sitting at her table, waiting for someone coming up from Headquarters. The leftovers of her lunch were still before her on the table, ready to be taken away by a passing waitress.  
距离 Geofront 五公里远的地方，赤木律子正在一家路边小餐馆里消磨时间，她刚吃完早午餐，耐心地坐在桌前，等待从总部来的人。她的午餐残余还摆在桌上，随时可能被路过的服务员收走。

The nearby jukebox was playing Hikaru Utada's "Addicted to You", the deceivingly cheerful funky beats belying the love-troubled heroine's dilemma intertwined into its lyrics:  
附近的点唱机正播放着宇多田光的《Addicted to You》，那欢快的放克节奏掩盖了歌词中陷入爱情困境的女主角的纠结：

_There is no need to meet you everyday  
无需每天相见  
I've got so many things to do  
我有很多事情要做  
There is no need to talk with you everyday  
没必要每天都和你说话  
I am annoyed with so many phone bills  
我对这么多电话账单感到烦恼  
No love lasts forever 没有爱情能永恒  
Worrying about our relationship deepens my love  
对我们的关系感到担忧加深了我的爱  
I never talk about our love to anyone  
我从未向任何人谈及我们的爱  
Because I am not a child  
因为我已不再是孩子  
This road won't last forever  
这条路不会永远持续  
When it ends we should go our own separate ways...  
当它结束时，我们应各自分道扬镳..._

As she listened to the lyrics closely, Misato sighed sadly, when heart-wrenching memories of Ryoji Kaji flooded into her mind, remembering the very last phone call he made to her answering machine shortly before he was murdered.  
当她仔细聆听歌词时，Misato 悲伤地叹了口气，心碎的记忆如潮水般涌入脑海，回忆起 Ryoji Kaji 在被谋杀前不久打给她的最后一通电话，那段留言至今萦绕心头。

_It is a funny story  
这是个有趣的故事  
Even though I'm hurt, I'm back for more  
尽管我受了伤，我仍选择再次归来  
I am addicted to you...  
我对你上瘾了...  
Just because I can't meet you  
仅仅因为我无法见到你  
Doesn't mean I will die  
并不意味着我会死去  
I understand our circumstances  
我理解我们的处境_

Or the tempestuous moment they shared on the bed not so long ago. She could also recall the squeaking sound of the electric fan that cooled them down in the heat of that night.  
或是不久前他们在床上共享的那段激情时刻。她还能记起那晚电风扇发出的吱吱声，为他们在这炎热中带来一丝凉意。

_Even so, I am still dying to meet you  
即便如此，我仍渴望与你相见  
I want to meet you everyday  
我想要每天见到你  
I don't know what to do with this feeling  
我不知道该如何处理这种感觉  
I want to be mature enough to deal with my own feelings  
我希望自己足够成熟，能够应对自己的情感  
But it takes time for that to happen  
但这一切需要时间来实现  
Oh baby... Oh baby...  
I am addicted to you...  
我对你上瘾了..._

As if she was desperately looking for refuge against the inner pain of her heart, Misato briefly held onto her silver pendant, a wrought cross that was a reminder of her father and the dark past.  
仿佛她在绝望地寻找心灵的避难所，美里短暂地握住了她的银质吊坠，那是一个手工制作的十字架，提醒着她父亲和那段黑暗的过去。

_There is no reason to restrict each other  
没有理由互相限制  
We do not need to pretend that we are mature  
我们不需要假装成熟  
At night, he doesn't answer his phone,  
到了晚上，他不接电话，  
Instead his answering machine does  
反而是他的答录机接了电话  
I want to call him to hear his message anyway  
无论如何，我想打电话给他，听听他的留言_

At the mere, hurting mention of the words "answering machine," Misato fought herself not to burst into tears, as she pinched the bridge of her nose hard. She also did not want to recall the final report on Kaji's murder.  
仅仅是因为提到了“答录机”这几个字，美里就感到一阵心痛，她努力克制自己不要哭出来，同时用力捏了捏鼻梁。她也不愿回忆起关于加持被谋杀的最终报告。

_I'm in love with you  
我爱上你了  
I know you want me too  
我知道你也想要我  
I don't say "I love you" not because I cannot say it...  
我不说“我爱你”不是因为我不能说..._

Again, Misato picked up her half-full can of Yebisu, and took a sip, as if the act was enough to let the rich malt beer dissipate her other worries, most especially the suffering Children.  
又一次，美里拿起她那半满的 Yebisu 啤酒罐，抿了一口，仿佛这个动作足以让浓郁的麦芽啤酒驱散她的其他烦恼，尤其是那些受苦的孩子们。

"Damn," she muttered, wondering why, oh, God, why all of these bad things have happened to her charges.  
“该死，”她喃喃自语，想知道为什么，哦，上帝，为什么这些糟糕的事情都发生在她的孩子们身上。

_It's a sad story  
Whenever you doubt my love, I love you more  
每当你怀疑我的爱时，我会更加爱你  
I may be addicted to you  
我可能对你上瘾了  
Everyone's excuse for not saying "I love you" is the same  
每个人不说'我爱你'的借口都一样  
Everyone thinks that they need reasons...  
每个人都认为他们需要理由..._

Misato swore to herself that she could still feel Kaji's tender kiss on her lips on their way home...  
美里暗自发誓，回家的路上她仍能感受到加持那温柔的吻留在唇上的感觉...

_Even so, I am still dying to meet you  
即便如此，我依然渴望与你相见  
I want to meet you everyday  
我想要每天见到你  
Can I tell you this feeling?  
我能告诉你这种感觉吗？  
Hold me rather than kiss me  
拥抱我胜过亲吻我  
Don't stop without telling me  
不要不告诉我就停下来  
Oh baby... Oh baby...  
I may be addicted to you...  
我可能对你上瘾了..._

"Oh... Hi there," Lieutenant Makoto Hyuga greeted her, as he emerged from the crowd of eatery patrons. He was still wearing his duty khaki-colored uniform.  
"“哦...嗨，你好，”真治·飞鸟中尉从餐馆的人群中走出来，向她打招呼。他仍然穿着他那身卡其色的制服。”

Misato blinked, pulled back to reality.  
美里眨了眨眼，被拉回了现实。

"Sorry, I got myself late, Major. I had to fix a few papers before going," Hyuga explained.  
"对不起，我迟到了，少校。我得在离开前处理一些文件，" 速水解释道。

"Thank God, you're a lifesaver," Misato said, while the younger officer took his seat opposite hers. "Tell me, what going on for today?" she whispered.  
“谢天谢地，你真是救星，”美里说道，同时年轻的警官在她对面坐下。“告诉我，今天有什么情况？”她低声问道。

Makoto narrowed his eyes and prepared to answer her. He slowly leaned himself across the table and told her in a low voice, "Major, I'm afraid that this place might not be right enough for us to discuss this. It's too damned sensitive."  
真琴眯起眼睛，准备回答她。他缓缓地俯身越过桌子，低声告诉她：“少校，恐怕这个地方不太适合我们讨论这件事。这太他妈敏感了。”

He was worried about unwanted surveillance by half a dozen intelligence apparatuses plying this city, either locals or hostile governments and organizations.  
他担心这座城市会受到半打情报机构的监视，无论是本地机构还是敌对政府和组织。

Taking a moment to ponder, Misato realized that this could be anything, more likely some bad news. "Okay," she finally decided. "Why don't we try taking my ride?"  
米莎托沉思片刻，意识到这可能是什么事情，更可能是坏消息。“好吧，”她最终决定，“我们为什么不试试开我的车呢？”

At first Makoto blinked, doubting whether he could withstand his superior's nerve-racking driving skills, but after a while he reluctantly agreed. "Well, yes. Let's go and cruise instead, Major."  
起初，真琴眨了眨眼，怀疑自己是否能承受上司令人神经紧绷的驾驶技术，但过了一会儿，他勉强同意了。“好吧，是的。让我们去兜兜风吧，少校。”

Both of them stood up and left the eatery, heading for the blue Renault Alpine sports car parked outside by the roadside curb.  
两人都站起身，离开了餐馆，朝着停在路边的那辆蓝色雷诺 Alpine 跑车走去。

A few minutes later, while driving on Circumferential Route 38 around the rim of Lake Ashinoko, Misato had her hands on the leather steering wheel and her eyes glancing briefly at the rear-view mirror for anything suspicious.  
几分钟后，当美里在芦之湖环线 38 号公路上行驶时，她的双手握着皮革方向盘，眼睛不时瞥向后视镜，留意任何可疑迹象。

Makoto finally spoke out, breaking the silence. "I'm sorry about the Children for the past few weeks, Major," he commented. "Especially with what happened to Asuka and Rei these days, and then Shinji."  
真嗣终于打破了沉默，开口说道：“过去这几周，孩子们的情况很糟糕，少校，”他评论道，“尤其是最近明日香和绫波出了事，紧接着又是真嗣。”

With an air of regret, Misato sighed. "Yeah, one Angel for each of them hitting their weakest point," she answered, before she remembered the troubled looks of her charges, each of them confined in the infirmary after every brutal attack.  
"带着一丝悔意，美里叹了口气。“是啊，每个使徒都击中了他们的最弱点，”她回答道，随后想起了她的孩子们在每次残酷攻击后被送进医务室时那忧心忡忡的表情。”

"I can see it in their faces. It's damned psychological," she added.  
"我能从他们的脸上看出来。这该死的心理作用，"她补充道。

"Yes. It seems that these attacks are targeted against their minds instead of the Evas," he assessed.  
"是的。看来这些攻击是针对他们的心灵而非 EVA 机体，"他分析道。

"What else have we got down there?" Misato queried, wanting to know more.  
"下面还有什么情况？"美里询问道，想要了解更多。

"We've just got a new candidate. A new pilot," Makoto informed.  
“我们刚有了一个新的候选人，一位新的驾驶员，”真嗣告知。

"What?" Misato blurted aloud, taken aback.  
"什么？" 美里脱口而出，感到意外。

"His name's Kaworu Nagisa and he just came in today a few hours ago, ready to replace Asuka," he explained.  
"他叫渚薰，今天几个小时前刚到，准备接替明日香，" 他解释道。

Misato shook her head, almost angry. "Oh, damn, they didn't inform me about this! Where the heck he came from, anyway?"  
美里摇了摇头，几乎有些生气。“哦，该死，他们没告诉我这个！他到底是从哪儿冒出来的？”

"Nagisa came in from Germany," he answered. "It was unexpected."  
“渚是从德国来的，”他回答道，“这出乎意料。”

Accepting that fact, as well as connecting Germany with SEELE, Misato nodded. "So we're going to deal with another enigma coming from the Committee, isn't it?"  
接受了这个事实，并将其与 SEELE 联系起来，美里点了点头。“所以我们又要面对委员会派来的另一个谜团了，不是吗？”

In agreement and with his frustration, Makoto sighed. "Yeah, the first crazy thing I got about him was a blank piece of paper, just like Rei. No personal data, no history, nothing at all. Just a birth date."  
在同意并带着沮丧的情绪下，真琴叹了口气。“是啊，关于他的第一件疯狂的事情就是一张空白纸，就像丽一样。没有任何个人资料，没有历史，什么都没有。只有一个出生日期。”

"Bloody hell," she muttered. _Great, the Commander finally has an expendable boy for his to use, except that this Nagisa could be anything_, she reflected.  
“该死，”她低声咒骂。太好了，指挥官终于有了一个可以随意使用的棋子，只不过这个渚可能是什么人，她暗自思忖。

"So I had no choice but to sneak into the Intelligence Division, and I got this," he spoke, before he pulled out a USB flash drive and handed it over to her.  
“所以我别无选择，只能潜入情报部门，然后我拿到了这个，”他说着，随即掏出一个 U 盘递给她。

"That's all?" Misato questioned as she took the flash drive and pocketed it.  
“就这些？”美里接过 U 盘，顺手放进口袋。

Makoto nodded. "All of it is in that stick, but I'm still sniffing after whatever I can come up with anything Nagisa written on it."  
真琴点点头。“所有资料都在那根 U 盘里，但我还在继续追踪，希望能找到渚写过的任何东西。”

Concerned about her aide's well-being, Misato shot Makoto a worried glance. "Look, Makoto, you're practically putting your neck on the line with what you're doing for me," she commented. "Lately things aren't working out for us."  
担心她的助手安危，美里忧心忡忡地看了真琴一眼。“听着，真琴，你为我做的事几乎是在拿自己的安全冒险，”她评论道。“最近我们诸事不顺。”

Makoto smiled. "Exactly, Major. It's worth the hazards I'm taking, and as for the Doctor, I'm also sorry to know that she's in the Stockade," he added. "Is it true she actually did steal some operational funds?"  
真嗣微笑道：“正是如此，少校。这些风险我甘愿承担，至于律子博士，我也为她身陷囹圄感到遗憾，”他补充道，“她真的盗用了一些行动资金吗？”

Misato scowled a bit, unhappy to hear what went wrong with Ritsuko after she destroyed the Rei clones, earning Gendo's ire in the process.  
美里皱了皱眉，听到律子在销毁绫波丽克隆体后惹怒了源堂，并因此遭遇不幸，她感到不快。

_I can't tell you exactly why,_ Misato thought, shaking her head.  
美里摇了摇头，心想：“我无法确切告诉你为什么。”

"Okay, I get you. But there's one thing we have to do for now," she spoke. "We have to grill this Nagisa through tests to see what capabilities he has, and how far he can go."  
"好吧，我明白了。但有一件事我们现在必须做，" 她说道。"我们必须通过测试来彻底考察这个渚薰，看看他有什么能力，以及他能走多远。"

"No problem, Major. He's already scheduled for that session later on."  
"没问题，少校。他已经被安排参加稍后的那场会议了。"

"Excellent. And yes, I have a very, very bad feeling about Nagisa," Misato told him with an air of suspicion, as their car entered the long tunnel to the car train station, which, from there led down to the Geofront. "He's a message, considering the kanji in his surname."  
"很好。是的，我对渚有一种非常非常不好的预感，" 美里带着怀疑的语气告诉他，当他们的车驶入通往汽车列车站的漫长隧道时，从那里可以直达 Geofront。"考虑到他姓氏中的汉字，他像是一个信号。"

"What does it mean?" Makoto asked.  
"那是什么意思？" 真琴问道。"

"Nagisa could be any message the Committee wants us to decode. We'll find out what he really is and once we know what poker school we're in, God help us," Misato concluded, before she made the car's final turn to her parking space on the linear train and stopped there, tire clamps engaged.  
“渚可能是委员会希望我们解码的任何信息。我们会弄清楚他究竟是什么人，一旦我们知道自己在哪个扑克学校，上帝保佑我们。”美里总结道，随后她将车最后转向线性电车上的停车位并停在那里，轮胎夹紧装置已启动。

"I want to meet this little stranger. He's interesting enough to arouse our suspicions," she added as she switched off the ignition and pulled up the hand brake, before the train lurched downwards.  
“我想见见这个小陌生人。他足够引起我们的怀疑，”她补充说，随即熄火并拉起手刹，就在列车突然向下倾斜之前。

In the bachelor quarters, sited somewhere in the labyrinth of the Geofront, the very small bedroom allocated to Kaworu measured about twelve feet on each side, making it a rather tight space. In that room, there was a desk with a study lamp, a bed that took the most space, a television and a stereo, and enough cabinet space for his clothes and shelving for his books.  
在位于地底都市迷宫某处的单身宿舍里，分配给渚薰的卧室非常狭小，每边大约只有十二英尺，空间相当紧凑。房间里有一张带台灯的书桌，一张占据了大部分空间的床，一台电视机和一台音响，以及足够的衣柜空间存放他的衣物和书架摆放他的书籍。

_It'll be okay, even if this room is so small_, he reflected, before the ashen-haired young man placed his duffel bag and the briefcase on the bed, and set about arranging his things.  
即使这个房间如此狭小，他想着，一切都会好起来的。灰发青年将他的行李袋和公文包放在床上，开始整理他的物品。

Kaworu also took out some of his books from the metal briefcase, and put them on the shelves. With methodical thoroughness, he arranged his stuff in the cabinet and the shelves until there was no crease or anything dangling to show.  
渚薰也从金属公文包里拿出了一些书，放在书架上。他以一丝不苟的细致，将物品整齐地摆放在柜子和书架上，直到没有任何褶皱或悬挂的物品。

_Perfect_, he nicely told himself.  
完美，他满意地对自己说。

Satisfied, Kaworu checked his schedule for the day. Indeed, within five minutes Commander Ikari expected to meet him, so he changed to his looser attire, a white, buttoned-up shirt over a yellow t-shirt, black pants and white sneakers. Checking his appearance on the mirror, Kaworu now figured that it would be acceptable to the Commander, even if his hair was still a grayish mess to behold.  
满意之余，渚薰检查了一遍当天的日程。确实，五分钟内碇司令就会与他见面，于是他换上了较为宽松的装束：一件白色扣衫搭配黄色 T 恤，黑色裤子和白色运动鞋。在镜子前审视了一番，渚薰认为这身打扮应该能得到司令的认可，尽管他的头发依旧是一团灰蒙蒙的乱糟糟。

Just as he was about to leave, one of the Section Two agents came up to his door, waiting for him to come out.  
正当他准备离开时，第二分部的一名特工走到了他的门前，等待他出来。

"Are you ready?" the agent asked Kaworu, who opened the door.  
“准备好了吗？”特工问卡沃鲁，后者打开了门。

The young man nodded. "Yes, and I am expected by the Commander to see him."  
年轻人点头。“是的，指挥官期待我去见他。”

Wordlessly, they set off in the direction of the Supreme Commander's office.  
他们一言不发，朝着最高指挥官的办公室走去。

---

Along the way, while being escorted by the agents flanking him, Kaworu took note of the corridors and passageways leading to one place or another in the massive complex. Despite the visible signboards telling the visitor where to go, Kaworu could not help but gently shake his head.  
在被两侧特工护送的途中，渚薰留意着通往庞大设施各处走廊和通道。尽管显眼的指示牌告诉访客该往哪里走，渚薰还是忍不住轻轻摇了摇头。

_It's too easy to get lost_, he thought. _Maybe somehow there's a little guidebook so that I can get around easily._  
他心想，迷失太容易了。也许不知怎么的，有一本小小的指南书，这样我就能轻松找到路了。

The journey was obviously taking them a little long to navigate. They boarded some elevators, rode on the escalators, and, at one point, had to ask a clerk where to get to the 26th level floor.  
显然，这段旅程让他们花费了不少时间。他们乘坐了几部电梯，搭乘了自动扶梯，甚至一度不得不向工作人员询问如何到达第 26 层。

Finally, they came up to a pair of ornately designed doors, which parted for Kaworu to enter Gendo Ikari's throne room.  
最终，他们来到一对装饰华丽的门前，门为渚薰打开，让他进入了碇源堂的御座室。

Framed by the bay windows showing the Geofront's expanse, the Commander was behind his desk as he sat on a high-backed chair. His hands were also propped in front of his face, a perennial habit of the Commander. Kaworu noticed the Sephirotic diagram etched impeccably on the ceiling and a bubble chamber etching on the floor, to emphasize its owner's seemingly obsessive penchant for geometric perfection and diagrammatic methodology in carrying out the Human Instrumentality Project. An example depicting science and religion as opposites yet both valuable.  
透过展示着地底都市广阔景象的弧形窗户，指挥官坐在高背椅上，背后是他的办公桌。他的双手也习惯性地撑在脸前，这是指挥官一贯的姿态。碇注意到天花板上刻着完美的生命之树图，地板上则是气泡室蚀刻，这些都突显了其主人对几何完美和图解方法论的执着，以此执行人类补完计划。这一例证展示了科学与宗教虽对立却同样宝贵的理念。

"Good morning. It is nice to see you," Gendo greeted.  
“早上好。见到你很高兴，”源堂问候道。

"Good morning, Commander," Kaworu answered.  
“早上好，指挥官，”渚薰回答道。

"Please be seated," Gendo offered, before Kaworu took his own seat, prepared to talk. In the center of the room was an unmarked folder placed on a round coffee table.  
“请坐，”碇源堂示意，随后渚薰也坐下，准备开始交谈。房间中央的圆形咖啡桌上放着一个未标记的文件夹。

"Thank you, Commander," Kaworu answered as he sat down.  
“谢谢您，指挥官，”渚薰坐下后回答。

Gendo nodded in satisfaction. "Hmmmm. Very well, then. Please take the folder on the table besides you and read it."  
源渡满意地点了点头。“嗯，很好。请拿起你旁边桌上的文件夹，阅读里面的内容。”

Obediently, Kaworu took the folder from the table and read its contents. It contained his work schedule, starting with synchronization and compatibility tests this afternoon, along with combat exercises throughout the week. In addition, there were already some forged documents for his use in the folder, such as required school forms, a birth certificate, a resident certificate and other red-tape paperwork for the tame government bureaucrats to consume. Attached with a paper clip on top of the folder, was a small plastic packet containing his brand-new NERV ID card.  
顺从地，渚薰从桌上拿起文件夹，阅读其中的内容。里面包含了他的工作安排，从今天下午的同步与兼容性测试开始，以及整个星期的战斗训练。此外，文件夹里已经准备了一些伪造的文件供他使用，比如学校所需的表格、出生证明、居住证明和其他应付政府官僚的繁琐文件。文件夹顶部用回形针夹着一个小塑料袋，里面装着他崭新的 NERV 身份证。

Name, rank and serial number.  
姓名、军衔和序列号。

"It's your papers, young man. Major Katsuragi will be your commanding officer, but I'm sorry to say that you have to replace the Second Children," Gendo informed.  
“这是你的文件，年轻人。葛城美里少校将是你的指挥官，但很遗憾地告诉你，你需要替代第二适任者，”源堂告知。

"What happened to her?" Kaworu asked, blinking.  
“她怎么了？”渚薰眨了眨眼问道。

Gendo answered, not even batting an eye behind his glasses. "She suffered from psychological trauma."  
碇源堂回答，眼镜后的目光毫无波动。“她遭受了心理创伤。”

Kaworu nodded in agreement, while noting the Commander's eyes carefully. _He's a cold man, without a doubt,_ he told himself. _I wonder how the Lilim could be able to withstand his personality. Perhaps this place is in some way propelled by fear._  
渚薰点头表示同意，同时仔细观察着指挥官的眼睛。毫无疑问，他是个冷酷的人，渚薰心想。我很好奇人类是如何忍受他的个性的。也许这个地方在某种程度上是由恐惧驱动的。

"Sir, what is the current status of the Third Children?" Kaworu asked, referring to Shinji.  
“长官，第三适格者的当前状态如何？”渚薰问道，指的是真嗣。

"I think he will still be good enough for duty, despite the events for the past few days," Gendo said. He had little concern about the other boy's problems.  
“我认为尽管过去几天发生了那些事，他仍然能够胜任任务，”碇源堂说道。他对那个男孩的问题并不怎么关心。

"I would like to meet him anytime," Kaworu answered. "He must be friendly."  
"我想随时见见他，"渚薰回答道。"他一定很友好。"

"Yes, he is capable of friendship, and it would be good for you to meet him as part of your duties. Cooperating and getting acquainted with your fellow team member is vital."  
"是的，他有交友的能力，作为你的职责之一，与你团队成员合作并熟悉对方是非常重要的。"

"I understand what you mean, sir."  
"我明白您的意思，先生。"

Inwardly, Kaworu shook his head in disappointment, before he decided to get to the Commander's hot button: Rei Ayanami.  
内心深处，渚薰失望地摇了摇头，随后决定触碰指挥官的热点：绫波零。

"With due respect, sir, how is it going for the First Children?" Kaworu asked, quite interested to see how he would react.  
“恕我冒昧，长官，第一适格者的情况如何？”渚薰问道，颇为好奇他会如何反应。

At the mention of Rei's other moniker, Gendo's normally-icy facial expression suddenly softened somewhat. "She is also fine. I would also like to say that she diligently performs all the tasks required."  
提到绫波的另一个称号时，碇源堂平时冰冷的表情突然缓和了一些。“她一切安好。我也想说，她认真执行所有任务。”

Again, Kaworu noticed the striking change in the Commander's face. _If true,_ he thought, _the Commander is known as a Svengali of sorts, as the Chairman describes him._  
渚薰再次注意到指挥官脸上明显的变化。如果这是真的，他想，正如主席所描述的那样，指挥官可谓某种意义上的斯文加利式人物。

"Well, sir, I am also quite very interested to meet her," Kaworu told him.  
“先生，我也很想见见她。”渚薰对他说。

Gendo nodded. "Good. You're just in time, and she happens to be coming in right now."  
碇点点头。“很好。你来得正是时候，她恰好现在进来。”

As if on cue, Rei opened both doors and stepped inside. Both men promptly turned their attention and glanced at the expressionless young woman standing attentively, with the doors behind her back.  
仿佛是按了开关，绫波零推开两扇门走了进来。两位男士立刻将注意力转向这位面无表情、身后是门的年轻女子。

"Commander?" Rei asked quietly, taken aback with facing Kaworu for the first time in the flesh at the same time.  
“指挥官？” 绫波轻声问道，面对着第一次以肉身出现的渚薰，她感到有些意外。

"Yes?" Gendo answered, fighting himself not to show his emotions as he maintained that business-matters-over-everything-else façade.  
“是的？” 碇回答道，努力克制自己不流露情感，保持着公事公办的外表。

"Is he the Fifth Children we had discussed about earlier?" Rei asked, looking at Kaworu.  
“他就是我们之前讨论过的第五适格者吗？” 绫波问道，目光投向了渚薰。

Gendo nodded. "Well, yes, and I would like you to meet our new candidate, Kaworu Nagisa," he informed, before he turned his attention to Kaworu.  
源堂点了点头。“嗯，是的，我想让你见见我们的新候选人，渚薰，”他告知后，便将注意力转向了渚。

"Mister Nagisa, meet Rei Ayanami. She will also be your teammate in Project E from this point onward," he introduced.  
“渚先生，这位是绫波零。从现在起，她也将是你在 E 计划中的队友，”他介绍道。

In unison, the First and the Fifth Children bowed deeply in due respect to each other. But Rei blinked as she asked herself, _You are the same as with me... Why are you here?_  
第一和第五适格者齐齐深深鞠躬，彼此表达敬意。但零眨了眨眼，心中自问，你和我一样...为何会在这里？

"Hello, Rei. I am very happy to see you," Kaworu said.  
“你好，零。见到你我非常高兴。”薰说道。

Rei was still speechless, trying to pick the right words, before she was able to say.  
零依旧无言，努力寻找合适的词句，终于开口道。

"H... Hello, Nagisa," she reluctantly greeted.  
"H... 你好，渚，" 她不情愿地打招呼。

Kaworu was wondering why she was acting like that. _Are you scared of me? I hope you're not feeling so bad._  
渚在想她为什么那样表现。你害怕我吗？希望你不会感觉太糟。

"How are you? I hope you're okay."  
"你还好吗？希望你没事。"

"I... I am fine," Rei answered with considerable difficulty.  
"我... 我没事," 丽回答得相当艰难。

Witnessing this nervous exchange of pleasantries, Gendo blinked behind his glasses, but quickly regained his composure by clearing his throat.  
目睹这紧张的寒暄，源渡在眼镜后眨了眨眼，但很快通过清嗓子恢复了镇定。

"Now that both of you have acquainted with each other briefly," Gendo said, "I will nevertheless observe how well you will work properly as part of this organization. I understand that your combined intelligence and abilities shall be of greater value, and finally with your help it is a matter of time that we may be able to thwart any possible avenues of invasion. Now is that clear?"  
"既然你们俩已经简短地互相认识了，" 源渡说，"我仍将观察你们作为这个组织一部分的工作表现。我明白你们的综合智慧和能力将具有更大的价值，最终在你们的帮助下，我们迟早能够挫败任何可能的入侵途径。现在清楚了吗？"

Kaworu and Rei nodded. "Yes sir," they answered.  
渚薰和绫波零点头。“是的，长官。”他们回答道。

However, before the Commander would continue any further, they all heard the knocking on the door.  
然而，在指挥官继续说下去之前，他们都听到了敲门声。

"You may come in," Gendo spoke loudly, still hunched behind his desk, with Rei and Kaworu going back to their seats, facing each other as they watched Sub-Commander Kouzou Fuyutsuki enter.  
“请进。”碇源堂大声说道，依旧躬身在办公桌后，绫波零和渚薰回到各自的座位，面对面坐着，看着副指挥官葛城斗藏进入。

"Oh, it's you, Mister Nagisa. We've been expecting you," Fuyutsuki told Kaworu, who smiled back.  
“哦，是你，渚先生。我们一直在等你，”冬月对渚说道，后者回以微笑。

"Of course, sir," Kaworu answered.  
"当然，先生，" 渚薰回答道。

"I'm sorry to say this, Children, but can I have a word with the Commander?" Fuyutsuki informed them. "It's just between us."  
"很抱歉这么说，孩子们，但我能和指挥官私下谈一谈吗？" 冬月告诉他们。"这只是我们之间的事。"

Both Children nodded wordlessly, before Gendo gestured two of the Children to get up and leave. "Both of you are dismissed. We'll call you in later on," he said.  
两个孩子默默点头，随后碇源堂示意其中两个孩子起身离开。"你们两个被解除了。我们稍后会叫你们进来，" 他说。

Rei and Kaworu nodded obediently, with the Fifth Children carrying his newly-forged papers. "Yes, sir," they agreed in unison, before they walked away.  
丽和薰顺从地点头，第五适格者拿着他新造的文件。“是的，先生，”他们齐声应道，随后便离开了。

After the albino teenagers left them alone, Fuyutsuki began to talk with his former student.  
在那些白化病少年离开后，冬月开始与他的前学生交谈。

"So you have no qualms about what happened to the First and the Second Children?" he asked. Lately Fuyutsuki wasn't happy about the recent spate of unfortunate events plaguing NERV.  
"那么，你对初号机和二号机发生的事情没有任何顾虑吗？"他问道。最近，副司令冬月对 NERV 接连不断的不幸事件感到非常不满。

"That is of no consequence to me. They did their purpose for the Plan," Gendo stated. "I will have the Second Children returned to Germany next week, and she's practically useless. As for the First, without anything to inhibit her, she will still be very helpful."  
"这对我来说无关紧要。他们已经完成了计划中的使命，"碇源堂说道。"下周我会把二号机送回德国，她已经没什么用了。至于初号机，没有任何东西能抑制她，她仍然会非常有帮助。"

Beneath his hands-off veneer, Fuyutsuki fumed at the remark. _I don't like the way you're talking about Asuka, Gendo. God, she's still a fragile young woman right now, teetering to the brink of insanity, and you dispose of her like a worn-out rag doll._  
在冷静的外表下，冬月对这番话感到愤怒。我不喜欢你这样谈论明日香，碇源堂。天哪，她现在还是一个脆弱的年轻女性，濒临疯狂的边缘，而你却像丢弃一个破旧的玩偶一样抛弃她。

"What about your son. I mean, the Third?" Fuyutsuki questioned.  
“你的儿子，我是说，第三适格者呢？”冬月问道。

Gendo snorted. "How long he will able to fulfill his role, but he is still needed for the accomplishment of the Plan," he remarked. "Assuming he does not lose his mind like the Second. This cowardly behavior of his isn't making things easy."  
源渡哼了一声。“他能履行职责多久，但为了完成计划，他仍是必要的，”他评论道，“假设他没有像二号那样发疯。他这种懦弱的行为可没让事情变得简单。”

Fuyutsuki scowled and closed his eyes. _The Plan, the Plan, your Plan. You're chasing it with nothing to lose but yourself, and you care for nothing else, not even your only son. And what about Doctor Akagi?_  
冬月皱眉，闭上了眼睛。计划，计划，你的计划。你为了它不顾一切，甚至不惜牺牲自己，对其他一切，包括你唯一的儿子，都漠不关心。那赤木博士呢？

"Are you still upset with what Akagi did to the Dummy Plugs?" he questioned, changing the subject this time.  
“你还在为赤木对模拟插入栓做的事生气吗？”这次他换了个话题问道。

Gendo answered him with a cryptic murmur that was either a yes or a no: "Mmmmm."  
源堂用一种模棱两可的低吟回应了他，那声音既像是在说是，又像是在说不是：“嗯……”

Fuyutsuki sighed, knowing very well for a long time what it really meant from the tone of that murmur. "So you're disappointed with her, right?"  
冬月叹了口气，他早已深知这种低吟的真正含义。“所以你对她的表现感到失望，对吧？”

"Yes, and I have no apologies for sending her to jail. It looks as if she merely helped the Committee get a little closer to Heaven by accelerating their plan before we could even catch up."  
"是的，我并不后悔把她送进监狱。看起来她只是帮助委员会在计划实施前加速了一步，让我们措手不及，从而更接近天堂。"

"And speaking about the Committee, they're more impatient than ever. We all know how many times you've talked with them for the last six months," Fuyutsuki commented.  
"说到委员会，他们比以往任何时候都更急躁。我们都知道过去六个月里你和他们谈了多少次，" 冬月评论道。"

Indeed, Gendo Ikari alone had done a number of meetings with the Committee about the Project and its all-important timetable, the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. It described and enumerated how many Angels would be slain before, whatever it was at its end, could be finally achieved. The Committee had repeatedly asked Gendo how far they have gone, got their answers before they reluctantly gave out more funding for the Project.  
确实，碇源堂单独与委员会就该项目及其至关重要的进度表——《死海文书秘卷》进行了多次会议。它描述并列举了在最终目标实现之前，将有多少使徒被消灭。委员会一再询问碇源堂他们的进展如何，得到答复后才勉强为该项目提供更多资金。

"Yes. With sixteen Angels we have taken care of, we'll see what form the Seventeenth Angel will take," Gendo agreed.  
“是的。我们已经处理了十六个使徒，看看第十七个使徒会以什么形式出现。”碇源堂同意道。

Fuyutsuki scowled a little, wondering how the 17th Angel would attack them and when. "I feel that it could be anytime this week. The days are getting shorter as we speak," Fuyutsuki remarked. "As for this Fifth Children, we're doing everything to know about him. He seems to be an unknown entity."  
冬月皱了皱眉，思考着第十七个使徒会如何以及何时攻击他们。“我感觉这周随时都可能发生。正如我们所说，日子越来越短了，”冬月评论道。“至于这个第五适格者，我们正在尽一切可能了解他。他似乎是个未知的存在。”

Gendo allowed himself a grunt, realizing that the Committee may have sent them a living Trojan Horse. "These old men, sending in someone we don't know very well," he answered.  
碇源堂哼了一声，意识到委员会可能给他们送来了一个活生生的特洛伊木马。“这些老家伙，送来一个我们不太了解的人，”他回答道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "It'll be taken care of. The MAGI is still scanning everything about Nagisa, and it would be very interesting to find out about this young man in the testing sessions later this afternoon. And there's one thing I should say about this, frankly."  
冬月点了点头。“这事会处理好的。MAGI 仍在扫描渚的一切信息，今天下午的测试环节中了解这位年轻人的情况将会非常有趣。而且，坦白说，有一件事我得提一下。”

"What is it?" “什么事？”

"Both Children looked all too similar," Fuyutsuki observed, before he realized what the Committee has cooked up for NERV. "I think that the Committee is also pursuing what we have done in advance."  
“两个孩子看起来太过相似，”冬月观察道，随即意识到委员会为 NERV 所策划的安排。“我认为委员会也在追求我们提前所做的事情。”

Gendo shook his head, somewhat displeased. "These old men," he muttered. "How impatient they are in their quest for Heaven."  
源度摇了摇头，略显不悦。“这些老头子，”他低声嘀咕，“在追求天堂的路上，他们多么急不可耐。”

_And so we're all doing everything to achieve the impossible, either that of the Committee or yours, at humanity's expense_, Fuyutsuki told Gendo in his mind.  
于是我们都在竭尽全力去实现那些不可能的任务，无论是委员会的还是你的，不惜以人类为代价，冬月在心中对源度说道。

In the corridor somewhere in the Headquarters building, Rei began to ask why Kaworu was here. She felt very much suspicious about his presence, and it was upsetting.  
在总部大楼的某个走廊里，绫波开始询问为什么渚薰会在这里。她对他的出现感到非常怀疑，这让她心烦意乱。

"Why are you here?" she questioned, staring intently at the young man's eyes.  
"你为什么在这里？" 她质问道，紧盯着年轻人的眼睛。

"I was sent to work here for a good cause, to serve this organization without any questions," he answered.  
"我是被派来这里工作的，为了一个崇高的目的，无条件服务于这个组织，" 他回答道。

Rei nodded silently.

"I have noticed something about you since the first minute," Kaworu said, looking into her eyes.  
"从第一分钟起，我就注意到了你的一些特质，" 渚薰说道，目光直视她的眼睛。

"Yes?" Rei asked, blinking.  
"什么事？" 绫波问道，眨了眨眼。

"The windows of your soul reveal to me what you're feeling right now.".  
"你灵魂的窗户向我展示了你此刻的感受。"

Rei was suddenly perplexed. "Pardon me...?"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I'm right, Rei. I know that you're troubled."  
渚薰点头。"是的，我没错，绫波。我知道你心烦意乱。"

Rei frowned and more confounded this time. "What?"  
丽皱起眉头，这次更加困惑。“什么？”

However, before Kaworu could continue any further, the Headquarters' PA system cut in with a three-tone ding.  
然而，在渚薰继续说下去之前，总部广播系统突然插入了三声叮咚声。

"Kaworu Nagisa, you are requested to contact Doctor Odani of the Medical Examination Section in the Infirmary immediately," the disembodied female voice announced.  
“渚薰，请立即联系医务室的医学检查科的尾谷博士，”那个没有实体的女性声音宣布道。

Kaworu apologetically smiled at her instead. "It's been very interesting for me talking with you for the first time, but I am sorry, Rei. I must go now," he concluded.  
渚薰歉意地向她微笑。“第一次和你交谈对我来说非常有趣，但我很抱歉，绫波。我现在必须离开了，”他总结道。

Rei blinked. "But Nagisa..."  
绫波眨了眨眼。“但是渚……”

"I'll see you later," he beamed and walked away, leaving Rei alone.  
“我们以后再见，”他微笑着走开了，留下绫波独自一人。

_Kaworu Nagisa... Who are you? What are you?_ Rei told herself, as she let her hand feel the heavy pounding of her heart.  
渚薰……你究竟是谁？你又是什么？绫波自问着，任由自己的手感受着心脏沉重的跳动。

Back in his lair, Keel Lorenz was enjoying his cup of tea when an aide entered his office. Before him a bank of flat-panel displays were ablaze with information, news feeds, satellite surveillance feeds, and other plethora of data sources. SEELE had its tentacles on almost everything on the planet, including the United Nations, the world's militaries and corporations, and even the most basic of human needs.  
回到他的巢穴，基尔·洛伦兹正享受着他的那杯茶，这时一名助手走进了他的办公室。他面前的一排平板显示器上闪烁着各种信息、新闻源、卫星监控画面以及其他众多数据来源。SEELE 的触角几乎遍布地球上的每一个角落，包括联合国、世界各国的军队和公司，甚至是最基本的人类需求。

"Pardon me?" the old man asked.  
“你说什么？”老人问道。

The aide took a breath. "Our source says that he's in place. As expected they're trying to get as much information on him."  
助手深吸了一口气。“我们的线人说，他已经就位了。正如预料的那样，他们正试图获取关于他的更多信息。”

Keel shook his head. "They'll never find out who he is, and considering that we have inside moles, we can manipulate their policies as we see fit. If they make a mistake, we have no problem of providing them an interesting penalty. Now you may go, your information will suffice."  
基尔摇了摇头。“他们永远查不出他的身份，而且考虑到我们内部有卧底，我们可以根据需要操纵他们的政策。如果他们犯错，我们不介意给他们一个有趣的惩罚。现在你可以走了，你的情报已经足够。”

Once the aide left, Keel snorted. Personally he enjoyed watching NERV being slowly humiliated bit by bit, while trying to make it more compliant to his agenda.  
助手离开后，基尔嗤之以鼻。他个人很享受看着 NERV 一点一点地被羞辱，同时试图使其更符合他的议程。

### Chapter 3 Suffer the Little Children  
Chapter 3 受难的孩子们

In one of the examination rooms in the Infirmary, Doctor Natsumi Odani was giving Kaworu Nagisa a full checkup, as she let her stethoscope touch his bare chest while sitting on the side of the examination table. He was stripped down to his plain white boxers, which made himself a bit comfortable.  
在保健室的一间检查室里，医生 Natsumi Odani 正在给渚薰进行全面检查，她坐在检查台边，用听诊器触碰着他赤裸的胸膛。他只穿着一条朴素的白色平角裤，这让他感觉稍微舒适些。

In her usual doctor's coat, Natsumi was slim, her dark-brown hair in a bob cut, and she wore a pair of horn-rimmed glasses behind intelligent brown eyes.  
Natsumi 一如既往地穿着医生的白大褂，身材苗条，深棕色的头发剪成波波头，戴着一副角质框眼镜，背后是一双充满智慧的棕色眼睛。

"You're healthy at first sight. Just good enough for anything bad that could be thrown at you later on," Natsumi commented. "Okay, Kaworu, can you take a deep breath?"  
“乍一看你很健康。足以应对之后可能遭遇的任何坏事，”娜兹米评论道。“好吧，薰，你能深呼吸一下吗？”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, ma'am," he agreed before he took a breath while Natsumi checked his breathing to see if his respiratory system could also stand up to heavy combat, as he knew he would be subjected to LCL ventilation, in which humans, with the use of fluorocarbons and gases mixed into the liquid, can breathe easily while their bodies are protected from severe G-forces and shock.  
渚薰点头。“是的，女士，”他同意后深吸一口气，而夏美检查他的呼吸，以确定他的呼吸系统是否也能承受高强度的战斗，因为他知道自己将接受 LCL 通气，在这种液体中，人类通过使用氟碳化合物和混合气体，可以在身体受到严重 G 力和冲击保护的同时轻松呼吸。

"Good. What do you eat for lunch, young man?" she asked.  
“很好。你午餐吃什么，小伙子？”她问道。

"I'm a vegetarian, ma'am. I don't allow myself to eat anything with meat in them," Kaworu informed.  
"我是素食者，女士。我不允许自己吃任何含有肉类的食物，" 渚薰告知。

Natsumi nodded. "Ah, I see. Just like the First Children, as what Dr. Akagi once told me."  
夏美点头。"啊，我明白了。就像赤木博士曾经告诉我的，第一适格者们也是这样。"

"How did you know?"  
"你怎么知道的？"

"Well, Dr. Akagi is, besides being the chief scientist here, she's also the official physician of the Children, so on most occasions we discuss your teammate's medical conditions. But last week Dr. Akagi was arrested."  
“嗯，赤木博士不仅是这里的首席科学家，还是孩子们的官方医师，所以我们大多数时候都在讨论你队友的医疗状况。但上周，赤木博士被捕了。”

Kaworu blinked. "Arrested?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。“被捕？”

Natsumi scowled as she sighed. "I'm sorry about the Doctor, Mister Nagisa. Administrative and criminal charges were filed against her because they claimed she stole operational funds and diverted it into her secret bank account," she stated, while she prepared a rubber hammer to check his kneecaps. "Embezzlement, they said. Unfortunately, we never got to know the details because it was covered up so quickly."  
夏美皱着眉叹了口气。“很遗憾关于博士的事，碇先生。她因为被指控盗用运营资金并转入她的秘密银行账户而面临行政和刑事指控，”她一边说，一边准备橡胶锤检查他的膝盖。“他们说这是挪用公款。不幸的是，我们从未得知详细情况，因为这件事很快就被掩盖了。”

Kaworu shook his head, as he let out his knees and crossed them, before Natsumi made several taps on each of them with the hammer. "Does it leaves you having a greater amount of burden?" he asked.  
渚薰摇了摇头，他伸直膝盖并交叉起来，随后夏澄火织用锤子在每个膝盖上敲了几下。“这会让你感到更重的负担吗？”他问道。

Natsumi Odani nodded as she took away the hammer, placing it on one of the trays. "Yes," she answered, "but I accepted the responsibility, as I had no other choice but to assume some of Doctor Akagi's operational roles. Now I would have wanted to write out your medical records immediately, but I have to obtain a blood sample from you. Is it okay?"  
夏澄火织点点头，将锤子放回其中一个托盘上。“是的，”她回答，“但我接受了这份责任，因为没有其他选择，我必须承担一些赤木律子医生的操作角色。现在我本想立刻为你填写医疗记录，但我需要先从你那里获取一份血液样本。可以吗？”

Kaworu gently nodded. "You may do so, Doctor."  
渚薰轻轻点头。“请便，医生。”

Natsumi went to a small table where the lancet was kept on a tray, and prepared it, along with a glass slide for Kaworu's blood sample. Kaworu let her take his hand and carefully she pricked his right forefinger, allowing a drop or two of his blood to patter on the slide. Natsumi then picked up an alcohol-soaked cotton ball from another tray and gave it to Kaworu.  
夏美走到一张小桌旁，那里放着托盘上的柳叶刀，她准备好了柳叶刀和一块玻璃载玻片，用于收集薰的血样。薰让她握住他的手，她小心翼翼地刺破了他的右食指，让一两滴血滴在载玻片上。随后，夏美从另一个托盘上拿起一块酒精浸湿的棉球递给薰。

As the young man cleaned the tip of his forefinger with the cotton ball, Kaworu decided to ask one more question about Asuka. "Doctor, I heard that the Second Children is being confined here. Where is she? And is she's okay?"  
年轻人用棉球擦拭食指尖时，薰决定再问一个问题关于明日香的情况。“医生，我听说第二适格者被限制在这里。她在哪儿？她还好吗？”

Natsumi sighed as she wrote down Kaworu's diagnosis report on a clipboard, knowing how bad Asuka really looked in her room, hooked up with a bunch of medical apparatuses. "She's in Room 303, and she's still in pretty bad shape, Mister Nagisa."  
夏美叹了口气，在剪贴板上写下薰的诊断报告，她知道明日香在房间里看起来有多糟糕，身上连接着一堆医疗设备。“她在 303 号房，情况还是很糟糕，渚先生。”

"Doctor, did she suffer any physical injuries?" Kaworu queried while he got off his perch and started to dress up, grabbing his clothes from the table.  
"医生，她有受到任何身体伤害吗？" 渚薰从栖息处下来，开始穿衣，从桌上拿起他的衣服问道。

Natsumi looked away for a while and answered rather apologetically. "Psychological. I'm also sorry about what happened to Miss Souryu. We tried what we could to recover her back, but given the damaging effect the 15th Angel has done to her. I'm afraid that though we may save bodies, it's difficult to salvage minds and souls."  
夏澄美回避了一会儿，颇为歉意地回答。"心理上的。对于惣流小姐发生的事情，我也感到很抱歉。我们尽力想让她恢复，但考虑到第 15 使徒对她造成的破坏性影响，恐怕我们虽然能拯救身体，却难以修复心灵和灵魂。"

"I understand, ma'am," Kaworu agreed.  
"我明白，女士，" 渚薰同意道。

"Thank you," Natsumi nodded, before she picked up the clipboard and jotted down her final notes. "Well, Mister Nagisa..."  
“谢谢，”夏美点头，然后拿起剪贴板记下她的最终笔记。“那么，渚先生……”

"Yes?"

"It's been a pleasure to be doing business with you, young man. While we process your medical records for the time being, I'll see you around. Thanks for coming here," Natsumi amiably told him.  
“与你合作非常愉快，年轻人。我们正在处理你的医疗记录，暂时先这样，回头见。感谢你的到来。”夏美友好地对他说。

They deeply bowed at each other in agreement. "Thank you, Doctor," he answered before he walked out of the room, in the direction of Asuka's room. He looked around for her room after taking the stairs to the upper floor, and found it: Room 303.  
他们相互深深鞠躬致意。“谢谢您，医生。”他回答后，便走出房间，朝明日香的房间走去。他上楼后四处寻找，终于找到了：303 号房间。

Indeed, as Kaworu looked upon Asuka's pale face, the sedated, unhappy red-haired girl was in her bed, surrounded by equipment monitoring her brain impulses and heartbeats. The bed sheet beneath her ashen, unmoving body was rumpled, while several electrodes were stuck onto her head and chest, and the sharp end of an IV drip was embedded onto her left arm. What's more, her right wrist was bandaged, a clear sign that she had tried to commit suicide.  
确实，当渚薰注视着明日香苍白的脸庞时，这位被镇静剂压抑着、不快乐的红色头发女孩正躺在床上，周围布满了监测她脑电波和心跳的设备。她那灰白、一动不动的身体下，床单皱成一团，而她的头部和胸部贴着几枚电极，左臂上则插着一根尖锐的静脉注射针。更甚者，她的右手腕缠着绷带，显然是曾试图自杀的痕迹。

Kaworu shook his head in sympathy, disheartened by Asuka's fate, a poor mirror of her former self. He recalled what he gleaned about Asuka from his file: a child prodigy; a bachelor degree holder at the age of twelve, obtained after graduating from the University of Wilhelmshaven in Germany; a fighting brown-belter in aikido, highly proficient in firearms; and sadly Asuka had a very traumatic childhood, resulting from the suicide of her mother ten years ago, committed while in confinement in a mental hospital, treated for irreversible psychosis.  
渚薰同情地摇了摇头，对明日香的命运感到心痛，她如今不过是昔日自己的一个凄惨倒影。他回想起从档案中了解到的关于明日香的信息：一个神童；十二岁时就获得了学士学位，毕业于德国威廉港大学；空手道棕带高手，精通枪械；而可悲的是，明日香有一个非常创伤的童年，源于十年前她母亲在精神病院中因不可逆的精神病而自杀。

Before he left, Kaworu whispered to Asuka, despite the distance between them.  
在他离开之前，渚薰尽管与明日香相隔甚远，仍轻声对她耳语。

"I'll see you again tomorrow, Asuka. Now I have to deal with Shinji later on as well... I'm sorry that Brother Arael has to hand over this test of faith upon you."  
"明天再见，明日香。现在我还得晚些时候处理真嗣的事情……很抱歉，阿瑞尔哥哥不得不将这个信仰的考验交给你。"

As he walked away, Kaworu did not notice the eyeballs moving under Asuka's eyelids while the electroencephalographic (EEG) console began to scream out its high-pitched display in huge pixilated peaks and ebbs.  
当他走开时，渚薰没有注意到明日香眼皮下眼球的移动，而脑电图（EEG）控制台开始发出其高音调的显示，呈现出巨大的像素化波峰和波谷。

She was either peacefully dreaming, or drowning helplessly in a never-ending nightmare.  
她要么是在平静地做梦，要么就是在无休止的噩梦中无助地沉沦。

_Somewhere in the hellish depths of her mind, in her drug-induced coma, Asuka was lost in a maze of black-painted doors and darkened corridors, desperately trying to get out. Her heartbeat was racing, she was sweating, her breathing shallow and rapid, and her eyes darted around.  
在她的意识深处，在那药物诱发的昏迷中，明日香迷失在一扇扇漆黑的门和昏暗的走廊构成的迷宫里，拼命想要逃出去。她的心跳加速，汗水淋漓，呼吸浅而急促，眼睛四处扫视。_

_It was her worst nightmare again.  
这又是她最可怕的噩梦。_

_"Mama!" she yelled out as she sprinted to one of the doors and opened it, to find a scene of her own self muttering "Chance!"  
“妈妈！”她大喊着，冲向其中一扇门并打开，却发现另一个自己正喃喃自语“机会！”_

_Angrily, Asuka slammed it hard, and ran to another door, only to meet a rag doll strung on its neck.  
愤怒之下，明日香用力甩上门，又跑向另一扇门，却只见到一个挂在脖子上的布娃娃。_

_"Do you want to die?" the doll asked with a voice like a bloodied razor blade cutting into her being.  
"你想死吗？" 玩偶用一种如同沾血的剃刀般的声音问道，直刺她的灵魂。_

_"No!" Asuka gasped loudly and shut the damned door again, shaking and sweating heavily, the salty rivulets running down on her face and her body.  
"不！" 明日香大声喘息着，再次猛地关上了那该死的门，颤抖不已，汗水淋漓，咸咸的汗珠顺着她的脸颊和身体流淌下来。_

_"Mama...! Where am I? Where am I? I want to get the hell out of here!" she shouted as she ran up through another darkened corridor and opened the door before her, revealing a part of her memory, of showing Kaji her chest while on the aircraft carrier, in the dead of night, trying to show her overwhelming adulation with the now-dead spy.  
"妈妈...！我在哪里？我在哪里？我要离开这个鬼地方！" 她一边喊着，一边跑过另一条昏暗的走廊，推开面前的门，眼前浮现出一段记忆，那是她在航空母舰上，深夜里向加持展示自己的胸部，试图用这种过激的方式表达对现已死去间谍的狂热爱慕。_

_"So look at me!" she loudly told Kaji, who ignored her attempts to get his attention.  
“所以看着我！”她大声对真嗣说，但真嗣却无视了她试图引起他注意的努力。_

_Kaji shook his head instead. "You're still a child."  
真嗣反而摇了摇头。“你还是个孩子。”_

_SLAM!_

_A roomful of stuffed, ripped monkey dolls filling to infinity into the darkness.  
一屋子塞满的、撕裂的猴子玩偶，无穷无尽地填满了黑暗。_

_SLAM!_

_Out of boredom, she kissed Shinji on the anniversary of his mother's death. Asuka pinched her nose as she shoved her lips into his, not wanting to smell his breath.  
出于无聊，她在真嗣母亲忌日那天亲吻了他。明日香捏着鼻子，将嘴唇贴了上去，不想闻到他的呼吸。_

_SLAM!_

_The lonely time of misery in her bedroom, on her hands and knees in the darkness, crying.  
在她的卧室里，孤独而痛苦的时刻，她在黑暗中双手双膝着地，哭泣着。_

_SLAM!_

_"I feel sick..." Asuka told herself. She was alone in the bathroom, feeling miserable.  
“我感觉恶心……”明日香自言自语道。她独自一人在浴室里，感到非常痛苦。_

_She was standing naked and was supposed to take a bath... except that she was very upset.  
她赤身裸体地站着，本该去洗澡的……只是她现在非常心烦意乱。_

_"I feel fucking sick..." Asuka mumbled profanely before she took a deep breath.  
"我感觉糟透了..." 明日香低声咒骂着，然后深吸了一口气。_

_Thus in one voice she ripped away with her rage:  
于是她用愤怒的声音撕心裂肺地喊道：_

_"Who wants to bathe in the same stinking water that Misato and stupid Shinji have bathed in? Who wants to use the washing machine that Misato and stupid Shinji have washed their underwear in?" she yelled.  
"谁愿意泡在美里和愚蠢的真嗣泡过的臭水里？谁愿意用美里和愚蠢的真嗣洗过内裤的洗衣机？" 她咆哮道。_

_Fists shaking, Asuka raised her curse-filled voice even higher. "Who wants to shit on a stinking toilet that Misato and stupid Shinji have used? Who wants to breathe the same damned air as Misato and stupid Shinji?"  
拳头颤抖着，明日香将她那充满诅咒的声音抬得更高。“谁愿意在一个被美里和愚蠢的真嗣用过的臭马桶上拉屎？谁愿意呼吸和美里、愚蠢的真嗣一样的该死的空气？”_

_"I hate Misato! I hate Shinji! I hate Wondergirl even more! I hate Papa! I hate Mama! But most of all I REALLY FUCKING HATE MYSELF!" she yelled out the loudest, her vitriolic hatred echoing around the bathroom.  
“我恨美里！我恨真嗣！我更恨绫波那个小婊子！我恨爸爸！我恨妈妈！但最最最让我恨之入骨的是我自己！”她吼得最大声，那刻骨的恨意在浴室中回荡。_

_Asuka then picked up the plastic ladle and threw it hard into the tiled wall with a resounding crack, shattering it into pieces.  
随后，明日香抓起塑料勺子，用力掷向瓷砖墙，发出一声响亮的破裂声，勺子碎成了几片。_

_"Damn... No... I can't take it anymore! Why me? Why me?" she wailed, as she went down onto her knees, crying.  
“该死……不……我再也受不了了！为什么是我？为什么是我？”她哭喊着跪倒在地，泪流满面。_

_SLAM!_

_Asuka now spotted the last door, her only way out, and quickly rushed towards it. Blood-red light cracked through the gaps, deceptively giving Asuka the impression that it was the escape she sought for, and opened the door with a hard yank.  
明日香现在看到了最后一扇门，这是她唯一的出路，她迅速冲向那里。血红色的光芒透过缝隙闪现，给明日香一种错觉，仿佛这就是她所寻求的逃生之路，她用力一拉，打开了门。_

_It wasn't. It was really a dead end.  
并非如此。这确实是一条死路。_

No. Not this door. Not this one... _she nervously told herself, blinking._  
不，不是这扇门。不是这一扇……她紧张地自言自语，眨了眨眼。

_A rag doll stood in her way, smiling like a homicidal maniac and it spoke out.  
一个破布娃娃挡在她面前，笑得像个杀人狂魔，并开口说话了。_

_"You want to live by yourself? You want to? You don't need everyone? You hate everyone?" the hellish doll sneered at her as it walked on its soft feet.  
“你想一个人生活？你想要这样？你不需要任何人？你恨所有人？”那个地狱般的玩偶嘲笑着她，用柔软的脚步走着。_

_Frightened, Asuka fearfully took a step back, not wanting to let this... little creep murder her.  
惊恐之下，明日香害怕地后退了一步，不想让这个...小怪物杀了她。_

_"No... Please, no..." she whimpered, choking on her tears.  
“不...请不要...”她哽咽着，泪水哽住了喉咙。_

_"Well, then, you hateful young lady... you're such a nice-talking liar!" the reddish-toned doll answered back before it cackled like a demon, its red button eyes flaming with hellfire.  
“哼，你这个可恨的小姑娘...真是个口蜜腹剑的骗子！”红色调的玩偶回敬道，随后像恶魔一样狂笑起来，红色的纽扣眼睛燃烧着地狱之火。_

_At the same time the floor dissolved into a tar pit beneath Asuka's feet.  
与此同时，地板在明日香脚下化作一片沥青坑。_

_"HELP ME! PLEASE HELP ME! HELP ME! Please stop it! I don't want to... NOOOOOO!" Asuka screamed as she was violently tugged into the ink-black abyssal pool, darker than the Sea of Dirac.  
“救救我！请救救我！救救我！请停下来！我不想……不！！！”明日香尖叫着被猛地拖入那漆黑如墨的深渊池中，比狄拉克海还要深邃。_

_Before the darkness swallowed her up completely, Asuka called out Shinji's name.  
在黑暗完全吞噬她之前，明日香呼喊着真嗣的名字。_

_"Help me Shinji! I need you...!"  
"救救我，真嗣！我需要你...！"_

---

Several miles away beyond a nightmare-ridden Asuka, the miserable young man was in Misato's apartment, feeling despondent as he was lying on his bed and listening to his SDAT player, which at the moment was playing a track from My Chemical Romance. The sliding doors leading outside to the balcony were wide open, letting in the breeze to cool him down.  
在噩梦缠身的明日香数英里之外，那位不幸的年轻人正身处美里小姐的公寓中，沮丧地躺在床上，听着他的 SDAT 播放器，此刻正播放着来自我的化学浪漫乐队的一首曲目。通往阳台的滑动门大敞着，让微风进来为他降温。

With blank eyes, Shinji Ikari looked at the ceiling above him, while recalling what he saw deep below the Geofront.  
真嗣一志用空洞的眼神望着天花板，同时回想着他在地表之下所见到的深渊。

_Rei... It may be correct... that impression. My mom's... Rei and my Mom... What's Father doing with them?_ Shinji told himself in his confused thoughts.  
丽...或许没错...那种感觉。我妈妈...丽和我妈妈...爸爸和他们在一起做什么？真嗣在混乱的思绪中自问。

_Rei... why are you a clone? Why?  
丽...你为什么是个克隆体？为什么？_

Slowly, Shinji turned his attention to Asuka's school uniform, still hung up on one corner of the room as it swayed along with the breeze, before he looked at her collection of pictures dotting the desk and the shelves. Without a doubt, she was smiling brightly in every picture, but it never told the viewer the true character beneath that deceiving smile.  
慢慢地，真嗣将注意力转向了挂在房间一角的明日香校服，它随着微风轻轻摇摆，随后他又看向桌上和书架上点缀着的她的照片。毫无疑问，每张照片中的她都笑得灿烂，但这笑容从未向观者透露那隐藏在欺骗性笑容下的真实性格。

He remembered the concern in Hikari's voice as she called him up by phone three days ago, telling him that Asuka ran away from her before the Class Representative woke up.  
他记得三天前光用电话打给他时的关切语气，告诉他明日香在班长醒来之前就跑掉了。

_Asuka, why did you run away? Why? Are you just as afraid as me? Are you guilty? Are you afraid of losing everything the way I did?  
明日香，你为什么要逃跑？为什么？你是不是也像我一样害怕？你是不是也感到内疚？你是不是也害怕像我一样失去一切？_

A tear flowed out of the corner of his eye, as he swallowed hard, feeling guilty for himself. For letting everyone down, the mortal sin for which he had been cast out.  
一滴泪水从他的眼角滑落，他艰难地咽了咽，为自己感到内疚。因为让所有人失望，这是他被逐出的滔天大罪。

_Why do you hate me? Asuka... if only you can tell me why...  
为什么你恨我？明日香...如果你能告诉我为什么..._

Shinji closed his teary eyes shut, trying not to think too much.  
真嗣闭上了泪眼，尽量不去想太多。

_God... Asuka, why can't we understand each other...? No... Maybe I have to talk to you... I don't know how I can talk with Rei... she's a blank slate... no, she's a clone...  
上帝... 明日香，为什么我们不能理解彼此...?不...也许我得和你谈谈...我不知道怎么和丽交流...她就像一张白纸...不，她是个克隆人..._

At that point, Shinji wiped off his tears with the back of his hand, before he got up on his feet and straightened up himself. He felt resolved enough, wanting to find the answers.  
那一刻，真嗣用手背擦干了眼泪，然后站起身来，挺直了身子。他感到决心已定，想要找到答案。

_I have to go. I need to talk to you. I want to understand why... Asuka... Why are you... angry with me?  
我得走了。我需要和你谈谈。我想知道为什么...明日香...你为什么...对我生气？_

While he tied up his sneakers, he let himself breathe a little more to center himself, trying to overcome his painful anxiety.  
当他系紧运动鞋带时，他让自己稍微深呼吸以集中精神，试图克服那令人痛苦的焦虑。

Finally, Shinji stood up and walked away, the SDAT player still in his pocket. What he had in mind was that he was going down to the Geofront, and try to make amends with the two other young women of his life, unaware that Kaworu was there.  
最终，真嗣站起身来，口袋里还揣着 SDAT 播放器，他打算前往 Geofront，试图与生命中的另外两位年轻女性和解，却未意识到渚薰也在那里。

---

In the bowels of the Geofront, within the darkness of the Dummy Plug Plant, Rei Ayanami was in the central tank of LCL, thinking about Kaworu. Only the tank she occupied was lit, but the bigger tank surrounding it was filled with pieces of her imitations, all dead as they floated in the orange-red liquid.  
在 Geofront 的深处，Dummy Plug Plant 的黑暗之中，绫波零正位于 LCL 中央舱内，思索着渚薰。只有她所在的舱室被照亮，而周围更大的舱室则充满了她的复制体碎片，所有复制体都已死亡，漂浮在橙红色的液体中。

She was far more than a blank slate Shinji thought of her, as troubled feelings were rushing through her mind.  
她远非真嗣所认为的一张白纸，纷乱的情感正涌动在她的心头。

_Kaworu, who are you?_ Rei told herself as tiny bubbles slowly wafted upwards.  
渚薰，你是谁？绫波自问，微小的气泡缓缓上浮。

_Why are you here? Are you here for me?  
你为何在此？是为了我而来吗？_

_Why did you think that I am what I am? Yes... but I... I could not... I could not remember anything about myself.  
你为何认为我就是我？是的...但我...我无法...我无法记起关于自己的任何事情。_

There was no memory of the fateful words she uttered on the day her last iteration destroyed Unit-00 on that very cold December morning. All that was left of what she first saw with her new eyes was the space of her sterilized-white room in the infirmary.  
她已不记得在那寒冷的十二月早晨，她上一世说出致命话语的那一刻，Unit-00 被摧毁的情景。她新生的双眼所见，仅剩下医务室那片消毒白净的空间。

Shinji and Misato came to her later that day, telling that she saved him...  
那天晚些时候，真嗣和美里来看望她，告诉她救了他...

But there was also no memory of it, vanished in the ground zero created by her suffering predecessor, the fireball ripping away the concrete and the earth around her Eva and Armisael.  
但这段记忆也已不复存在，被她那饱受折磨的前任所造成的零地带抹去，火球撕裂了围绕着她的 Eva 和 Armisael 的混凝土与大地。

Thus she could not remember anything that emotionally changed her, let alone her name, rank and serial number on her ID card. And then there were her tears on that same day, as they spattered upon the white bed sheet. While she cried, she wondered why she did it.  
因此，她无法回忆起任何情感上改变她的事物，更别提她的名字、军衔和身份证上的编号了。就在同一天，她的泪水滴落在那洁白的床单上。哭泣时，她不禁疑惑自己为何如此。

Out of despair, of pain, of not able to fulfill her death wish?  
是因为绝望、痛苦，还是无法实现她的死亡愿望？

Instead, Rei lived again, resurrected as the third iteration, and so she cried again in this little corner of her lonely world.  
然而，丽再次活了过来，作为第三代重生，于是她在这个孤独世界的角落里再次哭泣。

_Why am I here?_ she pondered, _And why I am still living? Why? I want to know the answers... but I could not find them... I feel lost... I am confused... I could not find my way..._  
我为何在此？她思索着，为何我仍在生存？为何？我想知道答案……但我找不到……我感到迷茫……我困惑不已……我找不到出路……

---

In the meantime, Kaworu stretched as he fitted himself into his newly-issued plugsuit, spangled with black and blue neoprene and high-strength fibers, before he pressed the two buttons on his wrist. The suit tightened automatically to accommodate the contours of his body.  
与此同时，渚薰伸展身体，穿上新发放的插入栓服，点缀着黑色和蓝色的氯丁橡胶与高强度纤维，随后按下腕部的两个按钮。服装自动收紧，贴合他身体的轮廓。

Satisfied, Kaworu walked out of the locker room with a confident stride towards the cages, knowing very well what he had to do through the sync testing process.  
心满意足的加持，自信地迈步走出更衣室，朝着 EVA 的笼子走去，他非常清楚自己在同步测试过程中需要做些什么。

Passing by the Eva cages before going up and ride the entry plug assigned to him, Kaworu glanced up at Asuka's blood-red, four-eyed war machine, moored in its own place, held down by a huge pair of braces against its shoulders, before he let his eyes at the purple Eva standing besides it.  
在前往自己的插入栓之前，加持经过 EVA 的笼子，抬头看了一眼明日香那血红色的、拥有四只眼睛的战争机器，它被固定在自己的位置上，肩部被一对巨大的支架牢牢固定，然后他的目光转向了旁边那台紫色的 EVA。

Horned and its face boasting the most fearsome scowl in the world, Eva-01 was a sight to behold. Kaworu could imagine how many Angels it tore apart during its bloody lifetime.  
长着角，面部带着世界上最令人畏惧的怒容，EVA-01 是一道令人瞩目的风景。加持可以想象它在血腥的一生中撕裂了多少使徒。

There was no longer any sign of Unit-00, as it was destroyed most recently.  
零号机已无踪迹，它最近被彻底摧毁了。

_Yes, they are truly the artificial gods men created for a purpose,_ Kaworu mused, before he went on his way. But something bugged Kaworu's conscience, as he remembered the other vanquished Children.  
是的，他们确实是人类为某种目的创造的人造神，渚薰沉思着，继续前行。但有些事情困扰着渚薰的良心，他回忆起那些被击败的其他孩子们。

_I could feel how miserable they are right up to this moment,_ he reflected, _trying to find the answers about themselves._  
我能感受到他们直到此刻的痛苦，他思索着，试图寻找关于他们自身的答案。

But out of that contemplation, Kaworu realized that he must do something about this.  
但在这种沉思中，渚薰意识到他必须为此做些什么。

_Rei isn't alone with her problems,_ he told himself. _So are Shinji and Asuka. They must be lost somewhere, so badly defeated._  
丽并不孤单地面对她的困境，他对自己说。真嗣和明日香也一样。他们一定在某处迷失了，如此彻底地被击败。

He thought of his duty, but because of his nature Kaworu felt that he must do something right. His sense of sympathy was heightened after he read the dossiers earlier in the day.  
他想到了自己的职责，但由于他的本性，渚薰觉得他必须做些正确的事。在今天早些时候阅读了档案后，他的同情心变得更加强烈。

_I'm making a choice right now, it's hard to bear to know how hard it is for them to suffer, and that I am supposedly perfect and I have everything. I cannot afford to just stand here as a mute observer of tragedy.  
我此刻正在做出选择，知道他们承受的痛苦有多深重，而我自己却被认为是完美无缺、拥有一切。我不能仅仅站在这里，成为一个对悲剧无动于衷的旁观者。_

Just as he was about to mount the elevator leading to the plug insertion deck, a technician in his forties chimed in, taking Kaworu out of his reverie.  
正当他准备登上通往插入栓安装甲板的电梯时，一位四十多岁的技术人员打断了他的沉思。

"So, you're the new kid in town?" the older man asked Kaworu.  
“这么说，你就是新来的小子？”年长的男人问川篱。

"Yes, sir," he nodded, blinking. "I'm ready."  
“是的，先生，”他点头，眨了眨眼。“我准备好了。”

"Okay, you're scheduled for testing today. Let's get you going right up there now," the technician informed.  
“好的，你今天安排了测试。我们现在就开始吧，”技术人员告知。

"Glad you're here, Major," Kouzou Fuyutsuki greeted as Misato and Makoto walked into the control room.  
"很高兴你来了，少校，" 葛城美里和真希波走进控制室时，冬月耕造欢迎道。

Beyond the thick plate-glass windows was Eva-02, the huge restraints tightened on its shoulders and ready for entry plug insertion. The crew of technicians that earlier swarmed the humanoid weapon with their tools and equipment had now stepped back to the safety of thick Plexiglas windows and heavily-reinforced concrete walls to watch Kaworu's first compatibility test.  
透过厚厚的平板玻璃窗，可以看到二号机，巨大的束缚装置紧扣在其肩上，准备进行插入栓的插入。之前围绕着这具人形兵器忙碌的技术人员们，现在已经退到了厚厚的有机玻璃窗和加固混凝土墙的安全区域，准备观看渚薰的首次兼容性测试。

"Well, yes sir. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to get the word about the newcomer," Misato admitted.  
"嗯，是的，长官。很抱歉我没有及时传达关于新人的消息，" 美里承认道。

"Never mind, Major. We're going to test Nagisa now," Fuyutsuki told her. "Hope this time there's nothing to worry about."  
"没关系，少校。我们现在要对渚进行测试，" 冬月告诉她。"希望这次没有什么可担心的。"

"Okay, sir. Let's see what he can show for us today," Misato commented, before Fuyutsuki turned his attention to the technicians.  
"好的，长官。让我们看看他今天能为我们展示些什么，" 美里评论道，随后冬月将注意力转向了技术人员。

"Ibuki, start up the systems," Fuyutsuki commanded.  
"碇司令，启动系统。" 冬月命令道。

"Yes sir," Ibuki reported as she tapped out the commands on the keyboard.  
"是，长官。" 伊吹边回答边在键盘上输入指令。

"Excellent," Fuyutsuki remarked before he glanced up at the video monitor showing Kaworu in the entry plug.  
"很好，" 冬月赞许地说，随后抬头看向显示着真嗣在插入栓内的视频监视器。

"Are you ready now?" Fuyutsuki asked the young man, who looked more relaxed than tense in the cockpit.  
"你准备好了吗？" 冬月问那位年轻人，他坐在驾驶舱里显得比紧张更放松。

Kaworu sighed for a moment, and then nodded. "Yes, sir, There are no problems."  
渚叹了口气，然后点点头。"是的，长官，没有任何问题。"

"Good. Lieutenant, prepare to throw the switches and insert the plug," Fuyutsuki directed, hearing the whines of the actuators and pistons as they inserted the plug into the red warrior's back and sealed it shut with its thick carapace of armor, before a huge orange hose let in thousands of liters of LCL flowing into the plug.  
"很好。中尉，准备扳动开关并插入插头，" 冬月指示道，听到执行器和活塞的嗡嗡声，它们将插头插入红色战士的背部，并用厚重的甲壳装甲密封，随后一根巨大的橙色软管注入数千升的 LCL 流入插头。

"Initial plug depth is now set at 0.105, plug data has been reprogrammed for Nagisa. LCL internal pressure is at nominal levels. Main power is ready to be activated," Shigeru reported.  
"初始插入深度现已设定为 0.105，插入栓数据已重新编程为渚。LCL 内部压力处于正常水平。主电源已准备好激活，" 四郎报告道。

"Good. Now it's a go for the main power circuits," Fuyutsuki ordered as he and Misato kept an eye on several consoles showing the full status of every system and sensor in Unit-02, before Shigeru threw the huge red switches forward.  
“好。现在主电源电路可以启动了。”冬月命令道，他和美里注视着几个显示二号机所有系统和传感器全面状态的控制台，随后四郎向前推下了巨大的红色开关。

All of them could hear the electricity immediately surge into the umbilical cable on the back of Unit-02 with enough wattage to light up a mid-sized town for a month.  
他们都能听到电流立即涌入二号机背后的脐带电缆，其功率足以点亮一个中型城镇一个月。

The huge of readouts and indicators on the displays before the people in the control began to show how far all the figures were climbing. Kaworu began to feel prickle on his skin, and he could hear the humming inside growing in volume and intensity.  
控制台前的人们面前的显示屏上，大量的读数和指示器开始显示所有数据正在攀升的程度。渚薰开始感到皮肤刺痛，他能听到内部嗡鸣声的音量和强度都在增加。

"Voltage increasing to the critical point... 0.5... 0.2... it's going up and towards nominal levels," Maya reported.  
“电压升至临界点...0.5...0.2...正在上升并趋向额定水平，”伊吹报告道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Second stage, ladies and gentlemen," he ordered.  
冬月点头。“第二阶段，女士们先生们，”他命令道。

"Synapses inserted. Junction in progress," Shigeru reported.  
"突触已接入。连接正在进行中，" 四郎报告道。

"Pulses transmitted. All circuits are operational. No problems with the initial contacts, it's all in the green." Maya announced again.  
"脉冲已传输。所有电路均正常运行。初始接触无任何问题，一切指标正常。" 真耶再次宣布。

"Power has been transmitted to the upper muscle group. There are absolutely no problems with the nerve links, sir," Shigeru shot back.  
"电源已传输至上半身肌肉群。神经链接绝对没有问题，长官，" 四郎迅速回应道。

Maya nodded in latent satisfaction. "Up to 2550 link points on the list here also all accounted for," she added. "He's over the line."  
摩耶微微点头，流露出满意的神情。“列表上的 2550 个连接点也都已确认无误，”她补充道，“他已经越过了界限。”

"Very good, Lieutenant. Now I need the A-10 contacts on initial," Fuyutsuki ordered as he saw everything in the green, before he looked at Kaworu again. The young man was still smiling in the amber light of the plug as he comfortably gripped the butterfly handles.  
“很好，中尉。现在我需要 A-10 的初始接触。”冬月命令道，他看到一切正常后，再次看向渚。年轻人在插入栓的琥珀色灯光下依旧微笑着，舒适地握着蝴蝶操纵杆。

"Roger, connecting the A-10 now," Ibuki told back as she typed out a string of commands on the keyboard.  
“收到，正在连接 A-10。”伊吹回应道，她在键盘上输入了一串命令。

"The connection to the A-10 nerve is operational," Makoto confirmed, seeing that there were no problems.  
“A-10 神经连接正常，”真琴确认道，发现没有问题。

"Eva-02 system control switched to Japanese as primary language. All initial contacts are set," Ibuki noted, before she checked the display for the sync.  
“Eva-02 系统控制已切换为日语为主要语言。所有初始接触设定完毕，”伊吹记录道，随后她检查了同步率显示。

"The mutual lines are connected. Synchronization rate is now settled at 75.2%," she reported. Inwardly she was surprised at the figure alone; the other Children could barely make it to 50 or even 60 percent of sync.  
“互连线路已接通。同步率稳定在 75.2%，”她报告说。内心对这一数字感到惊讶；其他孩子们的同步率通常只能达到 50%甚至 60%。

Satisfied, Fuyutsuki let off a sigh before he decided that it was time to check the plug depth.  
满意之余，冬月轻叹一声，随后决定是时候检查插入栓的深度了。

"Take the plug depth down to 0.3," he commanded. "Let's see how deep he can go."  
"将插入栓深度降到 0.3，"他命令道，"让我们看看他能深入到什么程度。"

"Roger, sir," Maya answered back as she let the plug down to another level. Indicators onscreen showed the representation of the entry plug sliding deeper into the Eva to increase control strength with the pilot.  
"收到，长官，"真希波回应着，将插入栓调整到另一个深度。屏幕上的指示器显示插入栓正进一步滑入 EVA 内部，以增强驾驶员的控制力。"

With a final look at all the systems after twenty minutes, Fuyutsuki asked them if everything was fine.  
在二十分钟的最终检查后，冬月询问他们一切是否正常。

"Any problems so far, people?" he questioned. Every display showed the figures and graphs in normal green.  
“到目前为止有什么问题吗，各位？”他问道。每个显示屏都正常显示着数字和图表，呈绿色。

"No problems, sir. The test procedures are operating normally," Makoto noted.  
“没有问题，长官。测试程序运行正常，”真希波记录道。

"What does the MAGI say about this?" Fuyutsuki queried at Maya, who looked at another one of the consoles. All three supercomputers reported a full optimized operation between the Eva and Kaworu.  
"“MAGI 对此有何说法？”冬月向真希波询问，后者正看着另一台控制台。三台超级计算机均报告 Eva 与渚薰之间的操作完全优化。”

"No data errors, sir. No one bit of it," Maya stated, before she continued monitoring the graphs for anything out of the ordinary.  
"“没有数据错误，先生。一点都没有，”真希波陈述道，随后继续监控图表，以防出现任何异常。”

Seeing that the test was going well – perhaps _too_ well – that Fuyutsuki turned his attention to the rest of the control room crew.  
"看到测试进展顺利——或许过于顺利——冬月将注意力转向了控制室的其他人员。”

"It's amazing that this young man synchronizes completely with Unit-02 before replacing the core data. it's all too perfect," he told them.  
"这个年轻人居然在更换核心数据前与二号机完全同步，太完美了，" 他告诉他们。

Still continuing her monitoring job, Maya could only manage a shrug. "Yes, sir, you're right. What Nagisa is doing is, it's rather impossible. I mean, sir, I couldn't believe it myself. None of the other Children can achieve a sync rate this _impressive_ in a very short time."  
梅村继续她的监控工作，只能耸耸肩。"是的，长官，您说得对。碇所做的，确实不可思议。我是说，长官，我自己都难以置信。其他孩子们都无法在这么短的时间内达到如此惊人的同步率。"

_This is downright eerie,_ Misato told herself. _I'd better talk to Kaworu. What he has... I have to find out what kind of message he is really carrying._  
这简直诡异至极，美里自言自语。我得和薰谈谈。他所拥有的……我必须弄清楚他真正携带的是什么信息。

An hour later, Kaworu was just finished dressing up after showering and toweling off, when Misato walked into the locker room.  
一小时后，卡罗鲁刚洗完澡，擦干身体并穿好衣服，这时美里走进了更衣室。

"Hello there. Kaworu Nagisa, I presume?" Misato asked.

"Oh, good afternoon to you, Major. You're my commanding officer, am I right?" Kaworu answered. _Well, she is still a very beautiful woman at twenty-nine,_ Kaworu remarked to himself, recalling the facts. _But it's so sad to hear what happened to Agent Kaji._  
"哦，下午好，少校。您是我的指挥官，对吧？" 薰回答道。嗯，她二十九岁依然是一位非常美丽的女性，薰暗自想着，回忆着这些事实。但听到凯吉特工的事情真是令人难过。

Misato smiled. "Yes, Mister Nagisa. I'm sorry we hadn't met before. Anyway, Mister Nagisa, what do you think about your first test today?" she questioned.  
美里微笑着。"是的，渚先生。很抱歉我们之前没有见过面。那么，渚先生，您对今天的第一次测试有什么看法？" 她询问道。

Kaworu gave her a cheerful reply. "It's not a big deal to me," he remarked as he extended his hand to her, which she accepted.  
薰愉快地回答她。"对我来说没什么大不了的，" 他说着，伸出手来，她接受了。

Upon contact, Kaworu felt something within her heart and soul, a stream of painful memories and deep emotions went through his senses. In a split-second, he heard the sounds of a crying woman in his mind, a gunshot, explosions and a flash of light.  
接触的瞬间，渚薰感受到她心灵深处的波动，一股痛苦的记忆与深沉的情感涌入他的感知。刹那间，他脑海中回响着哭泣的女声，枪响，爆炸声，以及一道闪光。

_What the...? Am I hearing things?  
这是怎么回事？我出现幻听了？_

Kaworu disagreed in his thoughts as he blinked. _It can't be. It must be a mind trick._  
渚薰心中反驳，眨了眨眼。不可能，这一定是某种心灵幻术。

"What's wrong?" Misato asked, seeing the young man frown a bit.  
"怎么了？" 美里问道，看到年轻人微微皱眉。

Suddenly pulled back into reality, Kaworu shook his head. "N...Nothing, ma'am. I'm okay."  
突然被拉回现实，渚摇了摇头。"没...没什么，女士。我没事。"

"I see. You may call me Major on base, but outside and in my home, you can call me Misato. I'm not a stickler for formalities and red tape, you see," she told him.  
"明白了。在基地你可以叫我美里少校，但在外面和在我家里，你可以直接叫我美里。我不太讲究那些繁文缛节，你懂的，" 她告诉他。

"Yes, ma'am, I agree with you," Kaworu said as he buckled the belt onto his pants and tightened it.  
“是的，女士，我同意您的看法，”渚薰一边说，一边将腰带扣在裤子上并拉紧。

"Good. Have you met the others?" she asked, referring to the Children.  
“很好。你见过其他人了吗？”她问道，指的是那些孩子们。

Kaworu nodded. "I've met Ayanami so far, ma'am, and I've also seen Souryu, too. I am very sorry about what happened to her," he noted.  
渚薰点点头。“目前我只见过绫波，女士，还有我也见到了惣流。对于她发生的事情，我感到非常抱歉，”他补充道。

Misato sighed. "Yes, Mister Nagisa. I wasn't happy when she was found in the ruins several days ago... She was in a state of traumatic shock and even tried to..."  
美里叹了口气。“是的，渚先生。几天前在废墟中发现她时，我并不高兴……她处于创伤性休克状态，甚至试图……”

"Well, ma'am, I hope she'll recover soon enough," Kaworu commented, optimism laced in his voice.  
“嗯，女士，我希望她能尽快康复，”薰评论道，语气中带着乐观。

Misato shook her head, apparently unsure. "Oh, I don't know when... She's due to be returned to Germany for further psychological treatment next week. And I also don't know what to say to her parents. "  
美里摇了摇头，显然不确定。“哦，我不知道什么时候……她下周就要被送回德国进行进一步的心理治疗。而且我也不知道该怎么跟她父母说。”

Kaworu pursed his lips, while buttoning up. "I am afraid that will come down to apologies, ma'am."  
渚薰系着扣子，抿了抿嘴唇。"恐怕这得靠道歉来解决了，女士。"

"Yeah, thanks. But have you met Shinji yet?" Misato questioned, changing the subject.  
“嗯，谢谢。不过，你见过真嗣了吗？”美里转换了话题问道。

Kaworu shrugged. "No, ma'am, and I have not yet run into him," he answered as he straightened out his shirt. "I'm sure he's alone right now."  
渚薰耸了耸肩。“没有，女士，我还没遇到他，”他一边回答，一边整理着自己的衬衫。“我相信他现在是一个人。”

"Are you sure you want to talk to him?" Misato queried, as she watched Kaworu sit down on the bench and wear his sneakers.  
"你确定要和他谈吗？" 美里问道，她看着渚坐在长椅上，穿上运动鞋。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, ma'am. I do and I will be happy to see him," he answered. "Anything else you want me to do today, ma'am? I have nothing on my work schedule."  
渚点点头。"是的，女士。我确实想，并且会很高兴见到他，"他回答道。"今天还有什么需要我做的吗，女士？我的工作日程上没有安排。"

"No... Nothing at the moment, Mister Nagisa, but are you interested in coming to my home for dinner? Just to get to know each other," Misato offered.  
"没有... 目前没有，渚先生，不过你愿意来我家吃晚饭吗？只是为了互相了解一下，" 美里提议道。

Kaworu blinked, before he beamed. "I am honored to be your guest, Major, but I'll look around for Shinji," he commented as he stood up on his feet.  
渚薰眨了眨眼，随即展露笑容。“能成为您的客人，我感到十分荣幸，真嗣，但我还是先四处找找真嗣吧。”他一边说着，一边站起身来。

"Good," she remarked, before she realized that this new guy might be a vegetarian like Rei. "Are you a vegetarian?"  
“那就好，”她回应道，随即意识到这个新来的家伙可能和绫波一样是个素食者。“你是素食主义者吗？”

Kaworu blinked again. "Yes. I can't eat meat for personal reasons."  
渚薰再次眨眼。“是的。出于个人原因，我不能吃肉。”

"Oh, just to make sure. Well, I'll see you later, Kaworu," Misato finished, before she walked out first.  
"哦，只是确认一下。那么，回头见，薰。" 美里说完，率先走了出去。

"Thank you, ma'am. It's been a pleasure to meet you," Kaworu answered.  
"谢谢您，女士。很高兴见到您，" 薰回答道。

As she walked toward the bank of elevators going up to her office, Misato felt really perplexed with her first impression of Kaworu. _Amazing,_ she told herself_. He's far more open than I ever expected. We'll see what kind of guy you are in the next few days, pretty boy._  
当她走向通往办公室的电梯时，美里对自己对薰的第一印象感到非常困惑。她心想：_太惊人了，他比我想象的要开放得多。接下来几天，我倒要看看你是个什么样的人，漂亮男孩。_

Back in the locker room, Kaworu rested against the wall and reflected. _Major, I can see it in your eyes; you are just as lonely as the others. I think that a walk outside would do me good._  
回到更衣室，渚薰靠墙休息，沉思着。少校，我能从你的眼中看出；你和其他人一样孤独。我想出去走走对我有好处。

Still troubled with his thoughts and aimlessly walking around the ruined city, Shinji decided to head for the shore of the crater lagoon instead of the Geofront as he had originally planned. The sky was colored tangerine, while the setting sun glowed with a orange brightness.  
心中仍感困扰，真嗣漫无目的地在废墟城市中徘徊，决定前往火山口湖的岸边而非原本计划的 Geofront。天空染上了橘色，夕阳散发着橙黄的光辉。

_I... I can't say what I wanted to say to them... I don't know... Mom, I feel really bad, really sorry... I don't want to be hated,_ Shinji sadly reflected. His eyes were downcast and his head hung in frustration, as he walked along, both of his hands in his pockets.  
我...我无法说出想对他们说的话...我不知道...妈妈，我感到很难过，很抱歉...我不想被讨厌，真嗣悲伤地反思。他目光低垂，头因沮丧而低垂，双手插在口袋里走着。

Spotting an empty soda can lying in the middle of the sidewalk, Shinji kicked it hard and watched the can fly away into the gutter with a clink.  
看到人行道中间躺着一个空汽水罐，真嗣用力踢了一脚，看着罐子叮当一声飞进了排水沟。

_What can I do?_ He sighed, as he climbed up over the huge pile of ferroconcrete slabs that marked the end of the street and the sidewalk, and got down to the other side with his feet on the sandy shore.  
我能做什么呢？他叹了口气，爬过标志着街道和人行道尽头的那一大堆钢筋混凝土板，双脚踏上了另一边的沙滩。

There, the waves gently lapped as the setting sun let its beams shine on the crests with the glitter of diamonds, while the breeze billowed across the wide expanse of the lagoon. This blissful sight in the midst of destruction was enough to warrant the defraying of the senses, after an agonizing day spent in the loneliness of his empty room, with only a tropicalized penguin for company.  
在那里，海浪轻轻拍打着岸边，夕阳的余晖如钻石般闪耀在浪尖上，微风拂过广阔的泻湖。在这片废墟中，这幅宁静的景象足以让人暂时忘却感官的痛苦，在经历了漫长而孤独的一天后，他的空房间里只有一只热带化的企鹅陪伴。

For a minute or two, Shinji stood there, observing the beauty of nature in motion, artfully altering his notion of the extent of destruction Unit-00 had wrought, when he heard someone whistling a rather familiar tune.  
有那么一两分钟，真嗣站在那里，观察着自然之美的动态变化，巧妙地改变了他对零号机造成的破坏程度的看法，这时他听到了有人吹着相当熟悉的曲调。

It was the Ode to Joy.  
那是《欢乐颂》。

Shinji turned around to find Kaworu sitting by a concrete slab, performing his single-instrument symphony.  
真嗣转过身，发现薰坐在一块混凝土板上，演奏着他那单乐器交响曲。

"Isn't it good that a song can greatly accompany the viewing of nature's beauty?" Kaworu asked cordially. "Like the spring blossoms of the lost years?"  
"一首歌能极大地陪伴欣赏自然之美，这不是很好吗？" 渚薰亲切地问道。"就像那些逝去岁月中的春日樱花？"

"What?" Shinji questioned, taken aback by Kaworu's unexpected appearance, before he slowly nodded. "Yes, just like the lost years."  
"什么？" 真嗣惊讶地问道，被渚薰出乎意料的出现吓了一跳，随后他缓缓点头。"是的，就像那些逝去的岁月。"

Kaworu smiled. "That is correct, Shinji Ikari. Music is the only thing that can bring joy and beauty to everyone, and it is the most sublime form of expression man has ever created since the beginning of time," he explained pleasantly.  
渚薰微笑着。"没错，碇真嗣。音乐是唯一能给每个人带来欢乐和美的东西，它是人类自始至终创造出的最高尚的表达形式，"他愉快地解释道。

"Ah... Who are you? How did you know my name?" Shinji asked, quite perplexed.  
“啊...你是谁？你怎么知道我的名字？”真嗣问道，颇为困惑。

Kaworu chuckled, happy to meet his new friend for the first time. "I am Kaworu Nagisa, and I was selected as the new candidate most recently," he introduced. "The Fifth Children, if you want it to be more ceremonial. And you're a household word back in Germany."  
渚薰轻笑，初次见到新朋友感到很高兴。“我是渚薰，最近被选为新的候选人，”他自我介绍道，“如果你想要更正式一点，那就是第五适格者。而且你在德国可是家喻户晓。”

Shinji blinked. "Sorry... I didn't know about that. Did you arrive today...?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“抱歉...我之前不知道这些。你是今天刚到的吗...？”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, my friend, early this morning. Just managed my first compatibility test session."  
渚薰点头。“是的，我的朋友，今天一大早。刚刚完成了我的第一次同步率测试。”

"Really?"

"Yes. It wasn't a big deal anyway. But..." Kaworu noted the other boy's melancholic face with concern. "You look so sad, what's the problem?"  
“是的。反正也不是什么大事。但是...” 渚薰注意到另一个男孩忧郁的脸庞，关切地问。“你看起来很悲伤，怎么了？”

"I... I'm upset about what happened for the past few days..." Shinji mumbled.  
“我... 我为过去几天发生的事情感到难过...” 真嗣喃喃道。

"Is it about Rei and Asuka?" Kaworu asked. "Heard about what happened to our fellow pilots before I came here. I am sorry about their plight."  
"是关于丽和明日香的吗？" 渚薰问道。"在我来这里之前听说了我们那些飞行员同伴的遭遇。我对他们的困境感到遗憾。"

"Yeah..." Shinji agreed. "I wasn't happy to know that Asuka nearly killed herself because... or Ayanami... Lost her memory after blowing up Unit 00... I feel that she looked so strange to me... not the Ayanami I know anymore, and I feel that I can't talk to her... she's too distant."  
"是啊..." 真嗣同意道。"得知明日香差点因为...或者绫波...在炸毁零号机后失去了记忆...我觉得她看起来很陌生...不再是那个我所认识的绫波了，我感觉无法和她交流...她变得太疏远了。"

With a sad sigh, Shinji sat on one of the slabs and stared off at the gleaming horizon. "What's worse... Kaji's dead now," he continued. "Somebody killed him... I don't know who killed him... Misato heard his last words on the answering machine and cried... Doctor Akagi's in jail... and my friends are gone because they don't want to be caught in the crossfire... Blaming me for giving them too much trouble... Don't want to think about what happened to Toji... so here I am, walking around and trying to forget my problems..."  
真嗣叹了口气，悲伤地坐在一块石板上，凝视着闪闪发光的地平线。"更糟糕的是...加持先生现在也死了，"他继续说道。"有人杀了他...我不知道是谁...美里在答录机上听到了他的遗言，哭了...赤木博士被关进了监狱...我的朋友们都离开了，因为他们不想卷入纷争...责怪我给他们带来了太多麻烦...不想去想对飞鸟做了什么...所以我在这里，四处游荡，试图忘记我的烦恼..."

Feeling dejected, Shinji hung his head. "Kaworu... why must everything be like this?" he lamented, "Why?"  
感到沮丧的 Shinji 低下了头。“Kaworu... 为什么一切都要这样？”他哀叹道，“为什么？”

There was a silent moment between the young men, amid the splash of the lapping waves... before Kaworu answered, breaking their silence.  
在海浪拍打的声响中，两位年轻人之间出现了片刻的沉默... 直到 Kaworu 打破沉默，回答道。

"Don't blame yourself, because pain and suffering are a fact of life..." Kaworu spoke. "Everyone gets hurt, because it always happens. But there are people who have gone through things a million times worse than piloting Eva, and managed to survive."  
“不要责怪自己，因为痛苦和苦难是生活的现实...”Kaworu 说道。“每个人都会受伤，因为这种事总是会发生。但有些人经历了比驾驶 Eva 糟糕千万倍的事情，却依然挺了过来。”

Shinji nodded. "They do?"  
真嗣点点头。“他们真的会吗？”

"Yes," Kaworu agreed. "But in your case, I believe that you can survive suffering if you can bear to live with the pain."  
“是的，”渚薰同意道，“但在你这种情况，我相信如果你能忍受与痛苦共存，你就能挺过苦难。”

Shinji shook his head. "I could not," he refused.  
真嗣摇摇头。“我做不到，”他拒绝道。

"Yes, you can fight your way through, and I believe in that," Kaworu insisted.  
“是的，你可以一路战斗下去，我相信你，”渚薰坚持道。

"No, I can't because... because I hate myself, and people hate me," Shinji finally admitted with a hard swallow of his throat.  
“不，我做不到，因为……因为我讨厌自己，人们也讨厌我，”真嗣终于艰难地咽了咽口水，承认道。

Kaworu frowned. "Why hate yourself? Why would people hate you?"  
渚薰皱起眉头。“为什么要讨厌自己？人们为什么会讨厌你？”

"Because I wish I was never here... I wish they left me in peace instead... I wish that all of this... this pain never happened to me. Because I don't have the guts to fight, and I have let down everyone... I don't believe in myself."  
"因为我希望我从未来过这里...我希望他们能让我安宁...我希望这一切...这些痛苦从未发生在我身上。因为我没有勇气去战斗，我让所有人失望了...我不相信自己。"

"Is it so? Look, you should be glad that I'm talking to you so that I could help," Kaworu answered. "So please, from what I know about you, you have to do the right thing because everyone is counting on you. You're the only last chance humanity has to survive, and I believe in that, too, and I want to see that you, you can believe in yourself, so that people will restore their trust in you, once you have proved to them that you can do it, and if it's okay for you, can you promise to yourself that you can hold your head up high, and prove that you can live with the pain?"  
"真的吗？听着，你应该庆幸我在和你说话，这样我才能帮助你，" Kaworu 回答道。"所以请听我说，根据我对你的了解，你必须做正确的事，因为每个人都在指望你。你是人类生存的最后希望，我也相信这一点，我也希望看到你能相信自己，这样人们在你证明自己能做到之后，就会重新信任你，如果你觉得可以，你能向自己承诺，你能昂首挺胸，证明你能带着痛苦活下去吗？"

With that question, Shinji let himself think for a minute, before he told Kaworu his final answer.  
提出这个问题后，真嗣让自己思考了一分钟，然后告诉了 Kaworu 他的最终答案。

"Y... Yes. You must be right... I'll try to live and learn with the pain," Shinji reluctantly decided.  
“是...是的。你一定是对的...我会试着带着痛苦生活和学习，”真嗣不情愿地决定。

Kaworu nodded. "Good, but don't worry anymore. I might help you get a grip. Feel better this time?"  
渚薰点头。"好，但别再担心了。我或许能帮你稳住。这次感觉好些了吗？"

Shinji smiled a bit. "Yeah... Thank you, Kaworu... And... can I shake your hand?" Shinji offered, along with his hand, which Kaworu accepted with pleasure.  
真嗣微微一笑。"嗯... 谢谢你，渚薰... 还有... 我能握你的手吗？" 真嗣伸出手，渚薰欣然接受。

Suddenly, disbelief hit him in a split second as a rush of emotions went into him. Images, sounds, feelings, the joy and the pain, but more of the pain, all coming from this young man who would be his friend for the next several days. A would-be friend desperately needing help, more than someone drowning in deep, icy water. Still the Fifth Children found it incredible to fathom the depths of Shinji's feelings.  
突然间，难以置信的感觉在一瞬间击中了他，一股情绪涌入心头。画面、声音、感受，喜悦与痛苦，但更多的是痛苦，全都来自这个即将在未来几天成为他朋友的年轻人。一个急需帮助的朋友，比深陷冰冷水中溺水的人更需要援助。尽管如此，第五使徒仍觉得难以理解真嗣情感的深度。

_My... not again..._ Kaworu wondered, _what am I feeling from him and his thoughts...? How in the world I managed to do this? Is it by touching?_  
我的...不会又是...渚薰疑惑，我从他那里感受到了什么，他的想法是什么...? 我究竟是怎么做到的？是通过触摸吗？

_Impossible..._ he concluded to himself. _Is it a gift?_  
不可能...他自言自语道。这是天赋吗？

Confounded at the odd face Kaworu made, Shinji cocked an eye at him. "Is there's something wrong with you?"  
对渚薰奇怪的表情感到困惑，真嗣斜眼看着他。"你有什么不对劲吗？"

"No, no, I'm just fine," Kaworu replied, and instead he told Shinji of his dinner invitation. "By the way, since there's nothing else to do today, Misato invited me to dinner at your place. Should we get going, then?"  
"不，不，我很好，" 渚薰回答道，转而向真嗣提起了晚餐邀请。"对了，既然今天没什么其他事，美里邀请我去你家吃晚饭。我们是不是该出发了？"

Shinji agreed, his mood somewhat improved, but he cautioned, "I warn you, Misato is a very terrible cook."  
真嗣同意了，心情略有好转，但他提醒道："我得提醒你，美里做饭可不怎么样。"

"Why?"

"She tried, but usually she burns it, so either I do the cooking or Misato brings home instant ramen from the convenience store," Shinji explained. "It's an old carryover from her days in college."  
"她倒是尝试过，但通常都会烧糊，所以要么我来做，要么美里就从便利店带回速食拉面，" 真嗣解释说。"这是她大学时代留下来的老习惯。"

"Oh," Kaworu spoke, but then he smiled, realizing that anything goes and relieved to see his new friend brighten up emotionally. "How bad it could be, anyway?" he added.  
"哦，" 渚薰开口说道，随即微笑起来，意识到任何事情都可能发生，并欣慰地看到新朋友情绪变得明朗。"反正能有多糟糕呢？" 他补充道。

---

Having come home to her apartment from Headquarters, after passing by a convenience store at a nearby town to buy some instant ramen, Misato was now in the kitchen, carefully pouring some hot water from the airpot into three opened double-sized containers of Cup Noodles.  
从总部回到自己的公寓，途经附近城镇的一家便利店买了些方便面后，美里现在正站在厨房里，小心翼翼地将热水壶中的热水倒入三个打开的双倍大小的杯面容器中。

After sealing the covers of the instant ramen cups, Misato turned on the radio on the counter and tuned to a station that played old love songs.  
封好方便面杯的盖子后，美里打开了柜台上的收音机，调到一个播放老情歌的电台。

While Pen-Pen was lolling beside her feet, Misato thought about the tiny chip that Kaji had left to her before he had been murdered. It contained information that he had compiled on NERV, The Marduk Committee and Project E over the past few years ever since he started doing his double-agent work between NERV and the Inquiry Section of the Japanese Ministry of the Interior.  
当 Pen-Pen 在她脚边懒洋洋地躺着时，美里想起了加持在被谋杀前留给她的那个小芯片。里面包含了他在过去几年中收集的关于 NERV、Marduk 委员会和 E 计划的信息，自从他开始在 NERV 和日本内务省的调查部门之间进行双重间谍工作以来。

_That little thing he gave to me, said that it took him 36 or so ways to put his secrets into my hands, so why it had to be hard for him to do it when he can simply stick that thing on the bottom of a can of Yebisu?  
他给我的那个小东西，说是用了 36 种方法才把秘密交到我手上，为什么他不能简单地把那东西粘在一罐 Yebisu 啤酒的底部呢？_

_Shit. Kaji... why did you have to die?_ Misato lamented, and then she sighed and closed her eyes, thinking once more of his kisses and caresses as the ballad went on. Thinking of the good times, of those drinking binges and the bedtime stories that followed.  
该死。加持...你为何非死不可？美里哀叹着，随后叹了口气闭上眼睛，随着那首情歌的旋律，再次回想起他的吻和抚摸。想起那些欢乐时光，那些酗酒狂欢和随之而来的床边故事。

Now her days will never be the same without Ryoji. What was left of his legacy, in her mind, was the scent of his cologne, the stubble of his unshaved chin, his voice on the phone and the roughness of his hands over her smooth body. She could also remember the way his fingers coursed through her raven-dark hair, his nose and lips gracefully following the contours of her slender neck, seeking the aroma of her lavender perfume, as he gently unwrapped her body.  
如今，没有源堂的日子，她的生活再也不会相同。在他留给她的记忆中，是他的古龙水香味，他未刮胡须的下巴上的胡茬，他在电话里的声音，以及他粗糙的手掌在她光滑肌肤上的触感。她还能记得他的手指如何穿过她乌黑的长发，他的鼻子和嘴唇优雅地跟随她纤细颈部的轮廓，寻找她薰衣草香水的气息，同时温柔地解开她的身体。

It was a poignant memory in her mind, nothing more. Misato shook her head resignedly before she resignedly listen to another of those love songs on the radio, except that this one was an old Meiko Kaji tear-jerker from a nearly-forgotten past:  
这在她心中是一段辛酸的回忆，仅此而已。美里无奈地摇了摇头，然后无奈地听着收音机里另一首情歌，只是这首是来自几乎被遗忘的过去，由老牌歌手前田庆子演唱的催泪之作：

_You're beautiful, you're the flower, he praises you.  
_你如此美丽，你是那花朵，他赞美你。  
But if you bloom, he will get you scattered.  
但若你绽放，他会让你凋零。  
Stupid. So stupid.  
_

_I go so stupid singin' my grudge blues.  
_我唱得如此痴傻，倾诉我的怨恨布鲁斯。  
You can accept your pitiful fate.  
你可以接受你那可怜的命运。  
But when you cry, he'll make you cry more.  
但当你哭泣时，他会让你哭得更厉害。  
_

_Women, oh women,_  
_It's women's tears that makes my grudge blues.  
_正是女人的泪水，勾起了我的怨恨之蓝。  
I hate you. Full of regret, never forgiven.  
我恨你。充满悔恨，永不被原谅。  
_

_Try to erase my memory, but cannot forget you.  
试图抹去我的记忆，却无法忘记你。  
It never ends, never, 永无止境，永不，  
It never ends, 'cause that's my grudge blues.  
永无止境，因为这就是我的怨恨之歌。_

_They say it's a dream, embers of one-sided attachment,  
_他们说这是一场梦，是单相思的余烬，  
laughing at you.  
So you decide to wake up, but fear to be fully awake.  
所以你决定醒来，却又害怕完全清醒。  
_

_Women, oh women,_  
_Women's soul beats on my grudge blues.  
_女人的灵魂在我怨恨的蓝调中跳动。  
Crimson roses have its sharp thorns.  
深红的玫瑰带有锋利的刺。  
_

_Don't wanna hurt you, but have to stab you with my thorn.  
不想伤害你，但不得不以我的刺刺向你。  
Burning, it's burning,  
It keeps on burning within my grudge blues.  
它在我怨恨的蓝调中持续燃烧。_

_No flower would bloom on my dead body.  
我的尸体上不会有花朵绽放。  
So I will live along hanging on my grudge.  
所以我将带着怨恨继续活下去。  
Women, oh women,  
My woman's life belongs to my grudge blues...  
我女人的生命属于我的怨恨布鲁斯..._

Once that sad song ended, Misato turned down the volume and smiled regretfully. _Kaji... You're such a stupid sonofabitch for dying on me... for breaking my heart, but... Even if your damned phone doesn't ring anymore, I think... I think that I should keep on living..._  
那首悲伤的歌结束后，美里调低了音量，遗憾地笑了。加持...你这个蠢货，居然就这样离我而去...让我心碎，但是...即便你那该死的电话再也不会响起，我想...我想我应该继续活下去...

_And if... if I die one day soon, only then I'll finally hear what you wanted to say to me for so long... You really wanted to say 'I--  
而如果...如果我不久后某天死去，只有那时我才能终于听到你长久以来想对我说的话...你真的想说的是‘我——_

Suddenly, she heard the doorbell ringing, which snapped Misato out of her thoughts.  
突然，门铃响起，将美里从思绪中拉回现实。

"Oh, I'll get it," Misato told Pen-Pen before she headed towards the front door and opened it.  
“哦，我去开，”美里对企鹅潘-潘说完，便走向前门打开了它。

"Hello, Misato," Kaworu greeted, with Shinji standing beside him, who looked relieved to be home for dinner and quite hungry. The three of them bowed deeply in unison, in deference to tradition.  
“你好，美里，”薰问候道，真嗣站在他旁边，看起来对回家吃晚饭感到宽慰且相当饿。三人齐齐深深鞠躬，以示对传统的尊重。

"Ah, you're just in time. Come inside, Kaworu. Welcome to my home," she answered as the two boys let go of their shoes and walked in. "Sorry, but I'm serving instant ramen tonight."  
“啊，你来得正好。进来吧，薰。欢迎来到我家，”她回答道，两个男孩脱下鞋子走了进来。“抱歉，今晚我只能提供方便面。”

"That's okay, ma'am," Kaworu answered. He also took note of the Katsuragi household, such as the housekeeping duties schedule still tacked onto the refrigerator, which had been expanded to include Asuka in its lineup; Pen-Pen's abode; and the large collection of high-proof booze and cans of beer that was strewn on the kitchen counter.  
“没关系，女士，”薰回答。他还留意到了葛城家的细节，比如仍然钉在冰箱上的家务值班表，已经扩展到包括明日香在内；Pen-Pen 的住处；以及厨房台面上散落的大量高浓度酒精饮料和啤酒罐。

_I figured that you're trying to drown the world in a bottle, given with your past problems, Misato,_ he remarked inwardly.  
“我猜你是想用一瓶酒淹没这个世界，考虑到你过去的烦恼，美里，”他在心里评论道。

"So, ma'am, no I mean, Misato, people must think that you are an unbeatable drinker from the look of this collection of yours," he commented.  
"那么，女士，不，我是说，美里，人们看到你这收藏一定会以为你是个无敌的酒豪呢，"他评论道。

"Yeah, I know, Kaworu," she admitted as she prepared the Cup Noodles, set their glasses and the chopsticks on the table, before she gestured to Shinji. "Could you get me my beer and some orange juice for us, please?"  
"是啊，我知道，薰，"她一边准备着杯面，一边在桌上摆好杯子和筷子，然后向真嗣示意。"能帮我拿一下我的啤酒和一些橙汁吗？"

Shinji nodded. "Okay," he answered as he went to the refrigerator and picked out a frosted can of Yebisu and a carton of juice before he handed them over to Misato.  
真嗣点点头。"好的，"他回答着走向冰箱，取出了一罐结霜的惠比寿啤酒和一盒果汁，然后递给了美里。

Misato turned around, to notice that Kaworu was still standing. "Hey, why don't you sit down a bit? Just feel at home," she invited, before the ashen-haired boy comfortably took his seat.  
美里转过身，注意到渚薰还站着。“嘿，为什么不坐下休息一下呢？就像在自己家一样，”她邀请道，随后灰发少年便舒适地坐了下来。

Finally, their dinner was ready, as they promptly took their chopsticks, before the two boys waited for Misato for her start.  
终于，晚餐准备好了，他们迅速拿起筷子，两个男孩等待美里开始。

_"Itadakimasu!"_ she announced, before all three of them peeled off the seals from their Cup Noodles and dug in with their chopsticks.  
“我要开动了！”她宣布道，随后三人撕开杯面的封条，用筷子大快朵颐起来。

While halfway through their dinner, Misato figured that she needed to shoot a few frank questions at Kaworu.  
晚餐进行到一半时，美里觉得她需要向渚薰提出几个直截了当的问题。

"Say, how long you were trained for this, I mean, in Project E?" Misato queried.  
“我说，你在 E 计划中接受了多长时间的训练？”美里问道。

Kaworu pursed his lips. "About five years. I was given the same training in Germany as with Asuka," he answered.  
渚薰抿了抿嘴唇。“大约五年。我在德国接受了与明日香相同的训练，”他回答道。

"Controlling the Eva?" she questioned point-blank.  
"控制 Eva 吗？"她直截了当地问道。

"Yes, along with the use of its weapon systems, armament and methods of combat," Kaworu added.  
"是的，还包括使用其武器系统、装备和战斗方式，"渚薰补充道。

"Seen a lot about the way they fought?" Misato asked further, referring to the other Children.  
"对他们的战斗方式了解很多吗？"美里进一步问道，指的是其他孩子们。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, after reviewing the video footage of every battle they were involved in." _Including Pyrrhic victories,_ he included inwardly.  
渚薰点头。“是的，在回顾了他们参与的每一场战斗的视频资料之后。”包括那些惨胜的战斗，他在心里补充道。

"Oh," Misato remembered. "Tell me about what you felt when you first met Rei. Did it go well?"  
“哦，”美里想起来了。“告诉我你第一次见到绫波时的感觉。相处得还好吗？”

Kaworu shrugged. "Well, almost. She was a bit shy." _And she was also too doubtful and helpless,_ he reflected sadly, recalling the confusion in the young woman's face earlier.  
渚薰耸了耸肩。“嗯，差不多吧。她有点害羞。”同时她也过于怀疑和无助，他悲伤地回忆起之前那位年轻女子脸上的困惑。

Misato nodded. "I see. I hope you'll keep on talking to her," she sighed wistfully as she popped off another beer.  
美里点点头。“我明白了。希望你能继续和她交流，”她带着一丝惆怅叹息，随即又开了一罐啤酒。

"Don't worry. I'll try to see her tomorrow so that I can get to know her better," Kaworu assured the woman, watching her drink.  
“别担心。我明天会试着去见她，以便更好地了解她，”渚向那位女士保证，注视着她喝酒。

Shinji also noticed the way she drank, and knew why. _After Kaji... she doesn't quite relish her beer the way she once used to. She's not the same anymore_.  
真嗣也注意到了她喝酒的方式，并明白了原因。自从加治之后……她不再像以前那样享受啤酒了。她已经变了。

"Tell me, Shinji. Do you know what I think of when I'm drinking beer?" Misato asked him as he filled up his and Kaworu's glasses with orange juice.  
"告诉我，真嗣。你知道我喝啤酒时会想到什么吗？"美里问他，同时他正为他和渚的杯子倒满橙汁。

"What?"

"When it comes to beer, I'm reminded of the good old days. That makes beer taste so good," Misato spoke, as she examined the can in her hand. "I celebrate the good times like my birthday or when my report or contract gets approved, or whenever Ryoji or Ritsuko wanted me to go out with them and paint the town red. Well, unlike everyone else, when I get a hangover I feel happy because it makes me feel so funny and fuzzy inside. "  
"说到啤酒，我会想起那些美好的旧时光。这让啤酒尝起来如此美妙，"美里说着，审视着手中的罐子。"我会庆祝好时光，比如我的生日，或者当我的报告或合同被批准时，又或者当加持或律子想让我和他们一起出去狂欢时。嗯，不像其他人，当我宿醉时我会感到快乐，因为它让我感觉内心既滑稽又温暖。"

"But now," Misato continued, shaking her head, "By God, these days aren't the same anymore, because beer now tastes different. I feel that the world's going crazy."  
"但现在，"美里继续摇头，"天哪，这些日子已经不一样了，因为啤酒的味道变了。我觉得这个世界正在变得疯狂。"

Shinji and Kaworu understood with their nods. _It's truly hard to be alone,_ Kaworu pondered.  
真嗣和薰通过点头明白了这一点。独自一人确实很难，薰思索着。

"So I'm holding up my drink for someone I knew and who's close to my heart," Misato concluded.  
“所以我举杯是为了我认识并深爱的人，”美里总结道。

Realizing that Misato was about to toast the late, lamented Ryoji Kaji, Shinji and Kaworu got their glasses of orange juice and raised them up.  
意识到美里即将为已故的、令人怀念的加持良治祝酒，真嗣和薰拿起他们的橙汁，举杯致敬。

"To Ryoji Kaji, the man who still loved me despite everything I was. Cheers_,_" she declared with a sad smile.  
"致碇源堂，那个尽管我的一切，依然爱我的男人。敬你_,_" 她带着悲伤的微笑宣布。

"Cheers," Shinji and Kaworu seconded in unison, and their drinks clanked together in the air, before they drank them down.  
"干杯，" 真嗣和渚薰异口同声地附和，他们的杯子在空中相碰，随后一饮而尽。

A few minutes of eating later, Misato spoke to Shinji.  
几分钟后，美里对真嗣说话。

"Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to visit Asuka in the infirmary," she asked.  
"嘿，我在想你是否愿意去医务室看望明日香，"她问道。

"I... um... I would like to, but..." he mumbled. _I'm a little afraid to do it_, Shinji doubted silently.  
"我...呃...我很想去，但是..."他含糊地说。我有点害怕这么做，真嗣默默地怀疑。

"Don't worry. Maybe Kaworu could come along with you. You might cheer her up, too. Is it okay?" Misato questioned Kaworu.  
"别担心。或许卡洛可以陪你一起去。你也许还能让她开心起来。这样可以吗？"美里询问卡洛。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I will help him," he agreed, and Shinji sighed in relief.  
渚薰点头。“是的，我会帮助他，”他同意道，而真嗣松了一口气。

Pleased, Misato smiled. "Okay. Where will you sleep tonight?" she asked.  
米萨托满意地笑了。“好的。你今晚睡哪儿？”她问道。

"Back below in my quarters at the base. I don't mind if I sleep alone," Kaworu informed.  
“回到基地我的宿舍里。我一个人睡也没关系，”渚薰告知。

Wanting to help his new friend, Shinji turned his attention to Kaworu. "Do you want to sleep here instead?" he offered cordially.  
想要帮助新朋友，真嗣转向薰，友好地提议：“你想在这里睡吗？”

Beaming, Kaworu stared back at him with thoughtful eyes. "I am also honored to accept your offer, my friend."  
薰微笑着，用深思熟虑的眼神回望着他。“我也很荣幸接受你的提议，我的朋友。”

Happy with this exchange, Misato began to talk about Hikari Horaki, of whom Asuka spoken so highly because of the Class Rep's cooking.  
对这次交流感到高兴，美里开始谈论起明日香赞不绝口的班长光子堇，因为她的厨艺。

"From what Asuka has said about Hikari," she admitted, "I really envy her because I messed up with my cooking skills. Sorry guys, but I grew up on too much instant ramen."  
"从明日香对光的说法来看，" 她承认道，"我真的很羡慕她，因为我自己的厨艺一团糟。抱歉各位，我从小吃太多方便面了。"

"I beg your pardon... Who is Hikari?" Kaworu asked.  
"请原谅我的冒昧... 光是谁？" 渚薰问道。"

"She's one of Shinji's classmates in school," Misato informed. "Hikari Horaki is their Class Representative, and according to Asuka, she's also an excellent cook at home."  
"她是真嗣在学校的一个同学，" 美里解释道，"光良光是他们的班长，而且据明日香说，她在家也是个出色的厨师。"

"Oh, I see," Kaworu agreed. "It's a pity that I am not able to meet Shinji's friends in time. Maybe, if this city returns to what it once used to be, even if it would only become just a small town, then I will be able to make more friends."  
"哦，我明白了，"渚薰同意道。"很遗憾我没能及时见到真嗣的朋友。也许，如果这座城市恢复到它曾经的样子，哪怕只是变成一个小城镇，那么我就能交到更多的朋友了。"

"Uh, by the way," Misato said. "Is it okay if you could watch TV with us?"  
"呃，顺便问一下，"美里说。"你能和我们一起看电视吗？"

Kaworu thought for a while, but he asked, "I don't mind what's on right now. Sometimes I watch, and sometimes I read."  
渚薰想了一会儿，然后问道："我不在乎现在播什么。有时候我看，有时候我读书。"

"I see," Misato said. "If you need anything else, there's no problem. I'm a gracious host, and as we're real alone in this neighborhood, it's a great occasion to have some guests, considering how hard things are lately."  
"我明白了，"美里说。"如果你还需要什么，尽管说。我是个好客的主人，而且我们这儿真的很偏僻，能招待客人真是难得，尤其是最近事情这么难办。"

Kaworu smiled. "Thank you. That was very kind of you."  
渚薰微笑道："谢谢你，你真是太好了。"

Misato raised her can again. "My pleasure."  
美里再次举起她的罐子。"不客气。"

### Chapter 5 Overnight Stay  
Chapter 5 天过夜

The night was very quiet, compared to a day's worth of cicadas chirping loudly across the ruined city. The outer limits of the metropolis were still lit with the harsh orange glow of street lamps and industrial lights, the only indications of living inhabitants solidly determined to hold on despite the devastating effects of Angel attacks. The huge crater lagoon reflected the glow of the crescent moon rising above the starry sky, shining upon the blackened ferroconcrete rubble of the glorious monuments of man's Tower of Babel-like attempt to reach the heavens.  
夜晚异常宁静，与白天满城蝉鸣的喧嚣形成鲜明对比。大都市的边缘依然被刺眼的橙色街灯和工业灯光照亮，这是仅有的表明居民坚定不移地坚守阵地的迹象，尽管天使攻击造成了毁灭性的影响。巨大的陨石坑湖面映照着新月升起在繁星点点的夜空中的光芒，照耀着人类试图触及天堂的巴别塔般辉煌纪念碑的黑色钢筋混凝土废墟。

In the suburbs of the city, Misato was still working late in front of her computer, the woman cooled down by a nearby electric fan. While her radio was softly playing Paramore, on her desk was the flash drive that Makoto had given to her early in the day and yet another half-empty can of Yebisu. She was thinking of the secrets of the Instrumentality Project she was halfway to unraveling, where the price in the search for the truth included the life of a 30-year old spy.  
在城市的郊区，美里仍在电脑前加班，身旁电风扇带来一丝凉意。她的收音机轻柔地播放着 Paramore 的歌曲，桌上是真琴当天早些时候交给她的闪存盘，还有半罐未喝完的惠比寿啤酒。她正思考着她即将揭开的参谋计划秘密，追寻真相的代价包括了一位 30 岁间谍的生命。

Taking the flash drive and plugging it into the computer's USB port, Misato looked for the files and opened each of them one by one. They were certainly to die for.  
米佐拿起闪存盘，插入电脑的 USB 接口，逐一查找并打开文件。这些内容确实令人难以抗拒。

One document had a series of slightly-blurred images embedded into its pages, accompanied by a beginning title page that said 'Advanced Mass Production Models'. Each of the images had a caption stamped with 'Sinkiang', 'Baikonur', 'Pyongyang' and 'Black Mesa', indicative of the secret locations where those photos were taken. But if one focused more closely, the subjects in the pictures were unmistakably Evas, except that these hulking beasts were strangely dissimilar to the familiar Units 01 and 02 in the Geofront stables -- all painted white, more organic and bestial.  
一份文档中嵌入了系列略显模糊的图片，首页标题为'高级量产型号'。每张图片下方标注着'新疆'、'拜科努尔'、'平壤'和'黑山'，指明了这些照片的秘密拍摄地点。但若仔细观察，图片中的主体无疑是 Eva，只是这些庞然大物与地堡中熟悉的 01 和 02 号机截然不同——全身涂白，更具生物性和野性。

"What the hell is this?" Misato mumbled in shock, before she noted that Makoto had added his comments near the end of the document:  
“这到底是什么鬼东西？”米佐震惊地喃喃自语，随后注意到真希波在文档末尾添加了评论：

_"What you're seeing here are nine new Evas in construction and due for activation anytime this month... but more likely this week, I believe."  
"你在这里看到的是九架新建造的 EVA，预计本月内随时可以激活...但更可能是在本周，我相信。"_

_"Much of this info came from my reliable source in Shanghai, who in turn got them from all over the world. You'd better believe that all of these developments stem partly from the impatience of the Committee behind the scenes, taking out their wallets because they feel that they're driven into a corner."  
"这些信息大部分来自我在上海的可靠消息源，他又是从世界各地收集来的。你最好相信，这些进展部分源于幕后委员会的不耐烦，他们感到被逼入绝境，于是掏出了钱包。"_

"What's going on?" Misato muttered her thoughts, before recalling how the situation had suddenly changed.  
"发生了什么？" 美里喃喃自语，随后回想起局势是如何突然变化的。

_We had received spare parts from Germany a few months ago,_ she reflected, _which were originally made for Units 5 and 6 to fix our busted-up Evas. That took an arm and a leg just to ask for those parts._  
几个月前，我们从德国收到了一些备用零件，原本是为 5 号和 6 号机制造的，用来修理我们那些破损的 Eva。光是申请这些零件就花费不菲。

_Now, they're burning a great deal of money, as if there's no tomorrow.  
现在，他们挥霍无度，仿佛明天不复存在。_

Misato frowned. _But has the Committee ever thought about our shrinking annual budget and other urgent requests? We've got some problems with upgrading our defenses, construction materials to fix our damaged facilities, and even new equipment for some of the departments waving requisition forms._  
美里皱起眉头。但委员会是否考虑过我们逐年缩减的年度预算和其他紧急需求呢？我们的防御系统升级、修复受损设施的建筑材料，甚至有些部门急需的新设备，都在挥舞着申购单。

_I can't understand why they're building a spare force this large. What are we going to face next, a massive Angel attack?  
我无法理解他们为何要组建如此庞大的后备力量。接下来我们要面对的，难道是一场大规模的天使袭击吗？_

Misato frowned and shook her head, disagreeing with that idea. _That's not a possible scenario, it looks too unrealistic. There must be another bigger reason why. Yeah, I've seen the freak show at Terminal Dogma. I've seen the Dummy Plug Plant and the graveyard in the forbidden areas, and now these new Evas being prepared for some huge Angel invasion from nowhere?_  
美里皱了皱眉，摇头表示不同意这种想法。那情景不太可能发生，显得过于不切实际。一定有其他更重要的原因。是的，我见过终端教条区的怪异景象。我见过模拟插入栓工厂和禁区的墓地，现在这些新造的 EVA 又是为了应对突如其来的大规模天使入侵？

_This is insane, really damned insane, and I'm seeing only the tip of the bloody iceberg.  
这简直是疯了，真的疯了，而我看到的不过是冰山一角罢了。_

Next, Misato checked the other file she opened.  
接着，美里检查了她打开的另一个文件。

True to Makoto's words, it contained some blank entries, followed by a large amount of cryptic synchronization and genetic data that Ritsuko would've easily understood and interpreted:  
正如真琴所说，里面包含了一些空白条目，随后是一大串晦涩的同步和基因数据，这些数据理应子很容易理解并解读：

**Fifth Children - Kaworu Nagisa

U:.999998

_This is not enough,_ Misato complained, finding the information too incomprehensible. _I need some more time to figure out who's this boy and where he comes from._  
这还不够，美里抱怨道，觉得这些信息太难以理解了。我需要更多时间来弄清楚这个男孩是谁，他从哪里来。

Now Misato became aware of Ryoji Kaji's data capsule lying near the keyboard, locked in by a password--  
现在美里注意到了键盘旁躺着的加持良治的数据胶囊，被密码锁住了——

_"...If you wanted to know the truth behind the mysteries for the past 15 years, it took me a big deal to get them. But using normal channels will not work, as they're probably been compromised."  
"...如果你想了解过去 15 年谜团的真相，我费了很大劲才弄到这些。但通过正常渠道是行不通的，因为它们很可能已经被渗透了。"_

_"Instead, the only one that's guaranteed to come into your hands is this capsule. This is all that I have. It's completely up to you how to use it, and the password is what we remember. "  
"相反，唯一能确保落入你手中的就是这个胶囊。这是我所有的东西。如何使用它完全取决于你，密码就是我们记忆中的那个。"_

--which only Misato knew, and it made her thoughts slowly drift to the man whom she both loved and hated, momentarily forgetting the work in front of her.  
--只有美里知道，这让她不由自主地想起了那个她既爱又恨的男人，暂时忘记了眼前的工作。

_Love..._ Misato lamented in her thoughts. _The price I have to pay to find the truth... is your life. God... Kaji, I'm worried because I'm still lost in the darkness... I can't say how, but..._  
爱... 美里在心中叹息。为了探寻真相，我必须付出的代价... 是你的生命。上帝... 加持，我担忧是因为我仍迷失在黑暗中... 我无法言明，但...

Misato sighed, wishing that he was here and sitting besides her, wishing that he would listen to her worries and try to give her comfort and sound advice. From that, a sad thought finally burst into her mind like a bubble from the depths.  
美里叹了口气，希望他能在这里，坐在她身边，希望他能倾听她的忧虑，试图给予她安慰和明智的建议。由此，一个悲伤的念头终于像深海中的气泡一样，在她心中迸发出来。

_But every time that I'm in your arms... each time I look into your face... you make me think of my father, and I hated him...  
但每次我依偎在你怀里... 每次我凝视你的脸庞... 你让我想起我的父亲，而我曾恨过他..._

_Damn... I hated keeping myself pure and clean for a long time... so I tried to be dirty instead by letting you into me, into my very being... I thought it was my happiness, my liberty, my refuge...  
该死...我讨厌长时间保持纯洁和干净...所以我试图通过让你进入我，进入我的内心来变得肮脏...我以为那是我的幸福，我的自由，我的避难所..._

_But it's not... By this thing we call love... it's also pain. Pain of being with you... yet Kaji, you also tore and bled me through as your arms wrap around me... You make me want to run away from your presence.... and up till now... I couldn't let go.  
但事实并非如此...通过我们所谓的爱...这也是痛苦。与你在一起的痛苦...然而，加持，你的拥抱也撕裂了我，让我流血...你让我想要逃离你的存在....直到现在...我无法放手。_

_Why?_

Misato, now the loneliest woman in the world at this moment, closed her eyes hard.  
在这一刻，美里成为了世界上最孤独的女人，她紧紧地闭上了眼睛。

_...Is it because I have no other place to go... no one else to talk to... no other man to care for... but you?  
...是因为我没有其他地方可去...没有其他人可以倾诉...没有其他男人可以依靠...只有你吗？_

Unknown to Misato, two young people in the other, smaller bedroom were also awake.  
米萨托并不知情，另一间较小的卧室里，两个年轻人也醒着。

As he lay comfortably besides his new friend on the bed, Kaworu Nagisa noted that for the last hour, Shinji Ikari hadn't able to sleep, an indication that a lot of nagging thoughts were plaguing his mind.  
当他舒适地躺在床上，身边是新朋友渚薰，碇真嗣注意到，过去的一个小时里，真嗣一直无法入睡，这表明他心中有许多烦扰的思绪。

"You couldn't sleep because of the bad things that happened to you?" Kaworu asked after the long silence between them.  
“你因为那些不好的事发生在你身上而睡不着吗？”长时间的沉默后，渚薰问道。

"Well... yes," Shinji admitted nervously.  
"嗯... 是的，" 真嗣紧张地承认道。

"I see. Tell me, my friend, I would like to know your story," he suggested.  
"我明白了。告诉我，我的朋友，我想听听你的故事，" 他提议道。

"What?" the other boy blurted.  
"什么？" 另一个男孩脱口而出。

"I mean, my friend, I was wondering how you ended up here. I'm also interested about your past," Kaworu said.  
"我是说，我的朋友，我很好奇你是怎么来到这里的。我也对你的过去很感兴趣，"渚薰说道。

For a moment or two Shinji let himself think about his entire life, a badly-disrupted childhood marked by a number of heartbreaks, before he started off with the first one that ripped his life apart.  
有那么一瞬间，真嗣让自己回想起了整个一生，一个被多次心碎打乱的童年，然后他开始讲述第一个彻底撕裂他生活的事件。

"Okay," he agreed after what appeared to be an eternity for him to start confessing. "My mother... My mother... when I was little... she... she died. Yes, she died and that's what put me here in this Godforsaken place."  
"好吧，"他在似乎是永恒的犹豫后同意了开始坦白。"我的母亲...我小时候...她...她去世了。是的，她去世了，这就是我来到这个该死的地方的原因。"

"I'm sorry for you, but how did your mother die?" Kaworu queried innocently, not wanting to hurt his new friend's feelings.  
"我很遗憾，但你的母亲是怎么去世的？" 渚薰天真地问道，不想伤害新朋友的感情。

"It... It was a freak accident... I was with Mom, and she took me to the laboratory on that day," the other boy recalled. "Thinking that I wanted to see what she did for a living, Mom showed me what she was working on..."  
"那...那是一场意外...那天我和妈妈在一起，她带我去了实验室，" 另一个男孩回忆道。"想着我想看看她平时的工作，妈妈就给我展示了她在研究的东西..."

Kaworu blinked. "What is it then? Was it?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。"那是什么？是吗？"

"Eva Unit-01... it was there, hooked up for testing. Yes, it was a huge frightening thing, staring back at me like a..."  
"Eva 初号机... 它就在那里，连接着进行测试。是的，它是一个巨大而可怕的东西，像是在盯着我..."

"Yes, a beast or a raging bull," Kaworu agreed.  
"是的，像一头野兽或是一头狂怒的公牛，" 渚薰同意道。"

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, right... a big beast of... what I never knew what it was for then. Thought that it was straight out of a TV show, except that this... Eva was for real."  
真嗣点点头。 "没错，就像... 一头巨大的野兽... 我当时并不知道它是用来做什么的。以为它直接从电视节目里跳出来的，只不过这个... 福音战士是真的。"

"What happened while you were there?" Kaworu asked.  
"你在那里的时候发生了什么？" 渚薰问道。

Shinji tried to remember, but he could only find fragments of that day... only voices.  
真嗣试图回忆，但他只能找到那一天的碎片...只有声音。

"I couldn't remember much," Shinji spoke, "but... while I was staring at Unit-01, thinking that... it was oddly funny to see this Eva come out of a comic book or something like that... Mom and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki were arguing about why I was there."  
"我记不太清楚了，" 真嗣说道，"但是... 当我盯着初号机，想着... 看到这个 Eva 从漫画书里走出来或者类似的东西，真是奇怪... 妈妈和副司令冬月在争论我为什么会在那里。"

"What did they argue about?"  
"他们争论了什么？"

"I overheard them... I think I could remember what... I remembered that Professor... er, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki asked Mom why she took me there, and told her that testing day was very important to them."  
"我无意中听到了...我想我能记得一些...我记得教授...呃，副司令官冬月问妈妈为什么带我去那里，并告诉她测试日对他们非常重要。"

"And then...?" Kaworu urged.  
"然后呢...？" 渚薰催促道。

"Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki was upset... really worried. He thought that by bring me there, anything could go wrong... He was also worried about me playing with the switches and things in the control room. But Mom told him something... like..." At that point Shinji solemnly closed his eyes, trying to recall the exact last words.  
"副司令冬月感到不安...真的很担心。他认为带我去那里，可能会出什么问题...他还担心我在控制室里摆弄开关和其他东西。但妈妈告诉他一些事情...像是..." 说到这里，真嗣庄重地闭上眼睛，试图回忆起那些最后的原话。

"She told him that she wanted to show me the future," Shinji confessed.  
"她告诉他，她想让我看到未来，" 真嗣坦白道。

"The future," Kaworu answered, letting that word roll around his mind. "I see. So she intended Eva to be for your future?"  
"未来，" 薰回答道，让这个词在脑海中回旋。"我明白了。所以她打算让 Eva 成为你的未来吗？

"Yeah... It could be," Shinji guessed. "But then I realized what she really meant about what she said."  
"嗯...可能是吧，" 真嗣猜测道，"但后来我明白了她那番话的真正含义。"

"How, and in what way?" Kaworu questioned, trying to probe further.  
"怎么，又是以什么方式呢？" 薰追问道，试图进一步探究。"

"I saw her again once more... when I was sucked into the Sea of Dirac back then. That was about two months ago."  
"我再次见到了她...那次我被卷入狄拉克之海的时候。那大约是两个月前的事了。"

Kaworu blinked. "Is that really true?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。“那是真的吗？”

Shinji swallowed hard. "Yes... she was there, all along. I thought that I was dreaming or what... Mom came out of nowhere and woke me up before I could die in that pit."  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。“是的... 她一直在那里。我以为那是一场梦或者什么的... 妈妈突然出现，在我掉进那个深渊之前把我叫醒了。”

"So in a sense she is in Eva, protecting you, right?" Kaworu asked.  
“这么说来，她在 EVA 里，是在保护你，对吧？”渚薰问道。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, she really is."  
真嗣点点头。“是啊，她确实是。”

Kaworu chuckled. "Ah, a guardian angel, some religious Westerners would say, that protects you from spiritual harm.... well, and it's not the kind you and your fellow pilots face off with."  
薰轻笑一声。“啊，有些西方人会称之为守护天使，保护你免受精神伤害……嗯，而且不是你和你的同伴们所面对的那种。”

At that point Shinji recalled something out of that irony. "Funny. I thought of what I said about that the other time..."  
这时，真嗣想起了那讽刺中的一件事。“有意思。我想起了上次我说的那件事……”

"It's about what?" Kaworu questioned briefly.  
"这是关于什么的？" 渚薰简短地问道。

"The Angels... messengers of God, and my father and Misato told me that they are enemies carrying Angelic names," Shinji informed.  
"使徒……上帝的使者，我父亲和美里告诉我，他们是携带天使之名的敌人，" 真嗣解释道。

"So it's so strange to you, doing battle with these supposed sacred creatures of God, right?"  
"所以对你来说，与这些所谓的神圣上帝造物战斗，很奇怪吧？"

"Yeah... I wonder why we're fighting and killing the hell out of them," Shinji spoke drowsily, still unsure as to what were the real intentions of their gigantic opponents.  
“是啊……我不明白我们为什么要这样拼死拼活地与他们战斗，”真嗣困倦地说道，仍然不确定这些巨型对手的真正意图是什么。

_It's a part of a plan you and your companions will soon find out,_ Kaworu reflected.  
“这是你和你的同伴们很快就会发现的计划的一部分，”渚薰思索着说。

"Beats me," he brusquely replied. "I see that it's time to get some sleep."  
“我也不知道，”他粗鲁地回答。“看来是时候睡一觉了。”

"Uh-huh..." Shinji yawned. "Thanks for giving me a chance to sleep well."  
"嗯嗯..." 真嗣打了个哈欠。"谢谢你让我有机会好好睡一觉。"

Kaworu yawned as well. "You're welcome. Good night, Shinji... Hope you dream good ones," he reassured as he covered up their bodies with the blanket.  
渚薰也打了个哈欠。"不客气。晚安，真嗣...希望你能做个好梦，"他一边说一边用毯子盖住两人的身体。

"Well, thanks again... Good night, Kaworu," Shinji finally answered before he closed his eyes and quickly fell asleep, not realizing that he forgot to set the alarm on the bedside clock.  
"再次感谢...晚安，渚薰，" 真嗣最后回答道，然后闭上眼睛，很快便睡着了，没有意识到他忘了在床头闹钟上设置闹铃。

But Kaworu didn't. He remembered the strange sensation he felt when he shook hands with Misato and Shinji.  
但渚薰没有。他记得与美里和真嗣握手时那种奇异的感觉。

_Strange... I felt as if I peered into their very thoughts... and their feelings in their hearts. Did I really do that?  
奇怪……我感觉仿佛窥探到了他们的思想……以及他们内心的情感。我真的做到了吗？_

Kaworu frowned a little. _Is it because of my nature? It could be... after all, I was probably created, out of unusual circumstances. Maybe I'll find out soon how this odd feeling really works for me... it could be something I never knew all along._  
渚薰微微皱眉。是因为我的本质吗？可能是……毕竟，我大概是在非同寻常的情况下被创造出来的。也许我很快就会明白这种奇怪的感觉对我到底意味着什么……这可能是我一直未曾了解的东西。

At last, Kaworu closed his eyes with a final thought, remembering his first meeting with the First Children.  
终于，渚薰闭上了眼睛，心中闪过最后的念头，回忆起与初号机孩子们的初次相遇。

There was something beneath her cerise eyes that caught his attention, even in the fleeting moment they parted after that very brief meeting.  
在她那淡红色的眼眸深处，有某种东西吸引了他的注意，即便在那短暂会面后匆匆别离的瞬间。

_Through your eyes, Rei, I could see sadness... and confusion in your heart. This leaves me wondering if you're lost,_ Kaworu pondered. _Are you afraid of something? Or you doubt about me?_  
透过你的眼睛，绫波，我看到了悲伤……以及你心中的困惑。这让我不禁思索，你是否迷失了方向，渚薰沉思着。你在害怕什么吗？还是对我有所怀疑？

_Now if only you can tell me why.  
现在，如果你能告诉我为什么就好了。_

Kaworu sighed. _Instead, I'll see you again tomorrow... and I hope we could talk over about your problems._  
渚薰叹了口气。那么，明天再见吧... 希望我们能谈谈你的烦恼。

Across the still waters of the crater lagoon in the middle of the city, it was a different situation. Rei was tossing and turning on the bed as she dreamed.  
在城市中央的火山口湖平静的水面上，情况却截然不同。绫波零在床上辗转反侧，陷入了梦境。

A dream, but more of a nightmare, full of fragments of her disjointed memories that made it difficult for her to define their true meaning. Voices she could not recall, snatches of mental images in a very violent, blurry jumble, threatening to become critical mass. The last clear voice she ever heard above the maelstrom of voices and images was.  
一场梦，却更像是一场噩梦，充斥着她支离破碎记忆的片段，让她难以界定它们的真实含义。她无法回忆起的声音，脑海中暴力而模糊的零星画面，威胁着要达到临界点。在声音和图像的漩涡中，她最后听到的清晰声音是。

_"If I let loose... there is no way my AT-Field would ever contain it... The Field will disintegrate... I... I must hold on..."  
“如果我放手...我的 AT 力场永远无法控制它...力场将会瓦解...我...我必须坚持住...”_

And a sudden explosion of bright light nearly blinded her eyes...causing Rei to wake up with a cry. Blinking in the darkness, Rei found herself sweating. She could also hear her labored breathing and the heavy beating of her heart.  
突然间，一阵刺眼的光芒几乎让她失明...这让绫波丽惊叫着醒来。在黑暗中眨眼，绫波丽发现自己满头大汗。她还能听到自己沉重的呼吸和剧烈的心跳声。

Trying to recover from her unexpected awakening, Rei promptly turned on the overhead study lamp before she propped herself to sit on the side of the bed, and moved the blanket away from her body. She could feel the drops of perspiration as they flowed down onto her skin.  
试图从意外的觉醒中恢复过来，丽立即打开了头顶的学习灯，然后撑起身子坐在床边，将毯子从身上移开。她能感觉到汗水滴落在皮肤上。

_What am I dreaming of?_ Rei contemplated between her breaths.  
我在梦见什么？丽在呼吸间沉思。

_I could not define it... it is all but... are they the parts of my memory that I could not know or remember?  
我无法定义它……这一切难道是……那些我无法知晓或记起的记忆片段吗？_

As the blue-haired girl sat still, bathed by the blue-white fluorescent light, Rei relaxed herself from the aftershocks of her nightmare, a dream that had no meaning. Slowly her mind wandered, recalling the circumstances of her resurrection as the third iteration, wondering why she was crying on that day:  
蓝发女孩静静坐着，被蓝白色的荧光灯笼罩，丽从噩梦的余震中放松下来，那是一场毫无意义的梦。慢慢地，她的思绪飘散，回想起自己作为第三代复活的情景，疑惑着那天为何会哭泣：

_"Are these tears? I am seeing these for the first time... but it does not seem to me to be the first time... I am crying... Why am I crying?"  
“这些是泪水吗？我第一次见到...但感觉又不是第一次...我在哭泣...我为何哭泣？”_

_Tears spattered the linen blanket that covered the lower half of her body, before the salty spatters widened into clearly-definable stains.  
泪水滴落在覆盖她下半身的亚麻毯上，随后咸涩的水渍逐渐扩散成清晰可辨的污迹。_

_Why?_

She also began to ask herself the same questions that were troubling her thoughts ever since the death of her predecessor.  
她也开始问自己那些自前任去世以来一直困扰她思绪的问题。

_I need an answer... I want to know why and what am I living for...  
我需要一个答案……我想知道为什么，我活着是为了什么……_

_What is my purpose as Rei Ayanami? Why do I have to exist?  
我作为绫波零的目的是什么？为什么我必须存在？_

Rei stood up and walked to the cabinet near the bed, where the pair of eyeglasses was kept in its case. She picked up the case, opened it, and then she examined the glasses. One of its lenses was cracked.  
丽站起身，走向床边柜子，那副眼镜就放在盒子里。她拿起盒子，打开，仔细端详着眼镜。其中一片镜片已经裂了。

The glasses were given to Rei not so long ago, yet although she recognized that these glasses belonged to the Commander, she had yet to remember how they came into her possession.  
这副眼镜不久前才交给丽，尽管她认出这是指挥官的眼镜，但她还未想起它们是如何落入她手中的。

_The Commander... he needed me, because that is what I was meant for_, she reflected_._  
指挥官……他需要我，因为那正是我的使命所在，她沉思着。

_But more likely I existed for something else,_ Rei shook her head. _I existed for the sake of duty and for a purpose... For without these... I am worthless... I have no direction... and I do not know myself._  
但更有可能，我存在是为了别的东西，丽摇了摇头。我为了职责和目的而存在……因为没有这些……我便一文不值……我找不到方向……我也不了解自己。

Rei slowly put the glasses back into its place and thought of her earlier resolve.  
丽缓缓将眼镜放回原位，回想起她早先的决心。

_I need some answers... I also need some help... but to whom shall I ask for help?  
我需要一些答案……我也需要一些帮助……但我该向谁求助呢？_

Back to the other side of town, Kaworu was in a different yet heavily-detailed dream, an amalgamation of the psychic feelings he experienced earlier.  
回到城镇的另一边，渚薰正沉浸在一个截然不同却又细节丰富的梦中，这是他之前所感受到的灵异情感的混合体。

_The sun was almost obscured by the haze of reddish dust, as he walked through a street of a village without a name, yet there was the now-familiar mountains ringing around Hakone. Devoid of life save for Kaworu himself, there was neither a voice that could be heard, not even the calls of the birds or summer cicadas. Bounding his path were traditional old houses typical of Hakone, with ceramic tiled roofs and wooden walls, but again there was no one to be found in those dwellings.  
太阳几乎被红色的尘雾所遮蔽，他漫步在一个无名村庄的街道上，四周是熟悉的箱根群山环绕。除了渚薰自己，这里没有任何生命的迹象，连鸟鸣或夏蝉的叫声都听不到。他的道路两旁是典型的箱根传统老屋，有着陶瓷瓦片屋顶和木质墙体，但这些住所里同样空无一人。_

_Undaunted by the non-existence of life and the melancholy of this dreamworld, Kaworu walked on, towards the center of the village, hoping there might be something he could find, until he came upon a park filled not with greenery but dead trees and grass.  
尽管这个梦境世界缺乏生命且弥漫着忧郁，渚薰并未因此气馁，他继续前行，朝着村庄的中心走去，希望能找到些什么，直到他来到一个公园，这里没有绿意盎然的植物，只有枯死的树木和草地。_

_And there was a voice, or so he heard, coming from the playground at the center of the park, which Kaworu took for a pulsing soul. Though he squinted in the dust to correct his gaze as he came near, the voice had finally taken a shape in the form of a crying child.  
然后他听到了一个声音，或者说他认为自己听到了，来自公园中央的游乐场，川渥将其视为跳动的灵魂。尽管他在尘土中眯起眼睛调整视线，当他走近时，那声音终于化作了一个哭泣的孩子。_

_Crying, the child stood with a big duffel bag besides him, trying to rub the eyes free of tears yet sobbing. This child also wore a striped shirt and black shorts, both dirtied with dust. But what grabbed Kaworu's attention was the kid's face, so familiar that recognition has finally come upon by providing a name.  
孩子一边哭泣，一边站在一个大行李袋旁，试图擦去眼中的泪水，却仍在抽泣。这个孩子也穿着一件条纹衬衫和黑色短裤，两者都沾满了灰尘。但吸引川渥注意的是那孩子的脸，如此熟悉，以至于终于通过一个名字唤起了认识。_

_Shinji, at the age of five, for no reason he was here except to cry.  
五岁的真嗣，没有任何理由地在这里哭泣。_

_But for what? Kaworu asked himself, but he answered it by seeing if he could talk to him.  
但为了什么？Kaworu 自问，随即决定尝试与他交谈。_

_"Shinji?" the Fifth Children spoke softly, "You're not alone, and I'm here for you. Why are you crying for?"  
“真嗣？”第五适格者轻声唤道，“你并不孤单，我在这里陪着你。你为何哭泣？”_

_Still, the kid standing before Kaworu continued crying as if he was the only one here, until it dawned upon Kaworu that this child could not see him. He pleaded silently for an answer... and little Shinji did.  
然而，站在 Kaworu 面前的孩子依旧哭泣着，仿佛他是这里唯一的一个人，直到 Kaworu 意识到这孩子看不见他。他在心中默默祈求答案……而小真嗣确实回应了。_

_"Why... did you have to... hate me?" he whispered while sobbing. "Leave me? Why?"  
“为什么……你非得……恨我？”他哽咽着低语，“离开我？为什么？”_

_Who have wronged you? Kaworu questioned him without speaking.  
谁伤害了你？Kaworu 心中无声地问他。_

_But before Kaworu could utter another word, the scene changed with the dust suddenly becoming thicker with the howling wind until it was replaced by white snow of a raging blizzard.  
但 Kaworu 还没来得及再说一个字，场景就随着尘土突然变得更加浓密，狂风呼啸，直到被一场猛烈的暴风雪中的白雪所取代。_

_As the snowstorm swept around Kaworu, surprised to see the world change before him, the flakes of ice covered the mountains and the ground until there was only the shape and outline of the land remaining. He turned around, and espied a complex of tents and prefabricated geodesic huts just a few yards away. Parked besides this complex were some snowmobiles and a tracked snowcat.  
暴风雪席卷着渚薰周围，他惊讶地看着世界在他眼前变化，冰晶覆盖了山脉和地面，直到只剩下大地的轮廓。他转过身，发现几码外有一片帐篷和预制的几何形小屋。这些建筑旁边停放着一些雪地摩托和一辆履带式雪地车。_

Where am I? _Kaworu asked, and this was instantly answered by a shouting match coming from the huts._  
我在哪儿？渚薰问道，这个问题立刻被从小屋传来的争吵声回答了。

_"Do you think you care much about me or Mother?" a girl yelled. "You're wrong about sending me down here, only to make me feel bad twice as much than I was back home!"  
“你以为你有多关心我或妈妈？”一个女孩喊道，“你错了，把我送到这里来，只会让我比在家时难过两倍！”_

_"Misato, calm down!" another voice, belonging to an older man, replied. "I've brought you here because I want to..."  
“美里，冷静点！”另一个属于年长男性的声音回应道，“我带你来这里是因为我想……”_

_Kaworu frowned as he looked at one of the huts bearing a painted sign:  
渚薰皱着眉头，看着其中一个小屋上挂着的彩绘招牌：_

**United Nations Antarctic Interior Research Station C03  
联合国南极内陆研究站 C03  
Markham Mountain Survey Area  
马克姆山脉勘测区  
Dr. R. Katsuragi - Chief of Research Group  
R·葛城博士 - 研究小组组长**

_Promptly the young man, not burdened by the intense cold of the southern wastes, found a frosted window from which he could watch the argument's sparks fly and understand the situation. He peered into the window, to find a younger Misato Katsuragi, fists clenched and her face wrought with rage, facing the man across the room who was obviously her father. Both of them wore thick orange parkas, but the tension was hotter than the stove-heated air inside.  
年轻人并未被南荒的严寒所困，他迅速找到一扇结霜的窗户，透过它观察着争执的火花四溅，理解了当下的情势。他凑近窗户，看到年轻的葛城美里，紧握双拳，脸上满是愤怒，正对着房间另一头的男人，显然那是她的父亲。两人都穿着厚重的橙色派克大衣，但室内的紧张气氛比炉火加热的空气还要炽热。_

_"For what?" Misato sneered back, while trying to hold back the tears.  
"为了什么？" 美里冷笑着反问，同时努力忍住泪水。_

_"I want you to witness what I have discovered," the older man replied. "Hopefully you can understand why I have labored for so long to bring my theories into reality, so that I shall not be laughed upon by those other scatologists who think I am only providing them hot air. Isn't that the Super Solenoid Engine could become a revolution in energy production?"  
"我希望你能见证我发现的东西，" 年长的男人回答道。"希望你能理解，为什么我如此长时间地努力将我的理论变为现实，以免被那些认为我只是在给他们提供热空气的粪便学家嘲笑。这不正是超级螺线管引擎能在能源生产领域引发革命的原因吗？"_

_With the mention of the S2 Engine, Kaworu had no idea how far he had gone into.  
提到 S2 引擎时，渚薰不知道自己已经深入到何种程度。_

_Misato shook her head in disappointment. "You haven't changed," she answered, hands now upon her face. "You tend to care more about your career and wanting to win a Nobel Prize... But think about me again... I have suffered for too long, don't you know? I never liked having my classmates asking my why I had a father like you, and I envy them for having parents who care."  
美里失望地摇了摇头。“你一点都没变，”她回答，双手此刻捂住了脸。“你总是更关心你的事业，渴望赢得诺贝尔奖……但再想想我……我已经忍受得太久了，你不知道吗？我从来不喜欢同学们问我为什么有一个像你这样的父亲，我羡慕他们有父母的关爱。”_

_Rebuffed by her reply, the elder Katsuragi, instead of paying attention, he turned away and walked out. But at that point Kaworu's dreamy vision faded into black.  
被她的回答所拒绝，老碇没有注意，而是转身走了出去。但就在那时，渚薰的梦幻景象渐渐陷入黑暗。_

---

The morning sun came up, well, too late for both Children. As he cracked open his eyes in the near-blinding glare, the harsh sunlight came up to Shinji's eyes, he groaned.  
晨光升起，对两个孩子来说，已经太迟了。当他在近乎刺眼的强光中睁开眼睛时，刺眼的阳光直射进真嗣的眼中，他呻吟了一声。

"Owww..." he groaned, squinting, before he slowly peered at the alarm clock and its red LED digits: it was 7:34 in the morning. That was what jolted him to life, since he realized in a split second that the Eva combat test session that day was set for 8 o'clock.  
"哎哟..." 他呻吟着，眯起眼睛，然后缓缓地看向闹钟及其红色 LED 数字：现在是早上 7 点 34 分。正是这个时间点将他惊醒，因为他瞬间意识到今天的 Eva 战斗测试定在 8 点钟。

"Oh SHIT!" he exclaimed, sprang up quickly and waking up Kaworu in the process. "I forgot to set the clock! My, I forgot!"  
"哦，该死！" 他惊呼一声，迅速起身，同时也把渚薰吵醒了。"我忘了设闹钟！天哪，我居然忘了！"

"W... What?" Kaworu drowsily murmured, before he looked at the clock to get what the other boy meant.  
"什...什么？" 渚薰睡眼惺忪地喃喃道，随后看向闹钟，明白了对方的慌张。

Shinji panicked and ran off to the bathroom with his towel.  
真嗣慌了神，抓着毛巾跑向浴室。

"Damn it, we're late! We have a test session today!" he shot back, before he rushed out of the room.  
“该死，我们迟到了！今天有测试训练！”他回了一句，随即冲出了房间。

"Oh," Kaworu uttered, while he put away their blanket away and got his feet on the matted tatami floor.  
"哦，" 渚薰说着，将他们的毯子收起，双脚踏上了榻榻米地板。

_Lilim,_ he mused, shaking his head as he walked out of the bedroom, grabbing a red towel along the way. _They are never too perfect._  
人类，他沉思着，摇了摇头，走出卧室时顺手抓了一条红毛巾。他们从未完美无缺。

By the time he was in the kitchen, Shinji frantically twisted the doorknob to the bathroom.  
当他走进厨房时，真嗣急切地扭动着浴室的门把手。

"Look, I'm still busy, okay?" Misato shouted back from the inside, water splashing loudly behind the door. "Just wait!"  
"听着，我还忙着呢，好吗？" 美里从里面喊回来，门后水花溅起的声音很大。"等着吧！"

"Great," Shinji mumbled, letting go of the doorknob, before he turned around to see Kaworu stretching out with a yawn.  
"真糟糕，" 真嗣咕哝着，松开了门把手，转身看到渚薰正打着哈欠伸懒腰。

"I suppose that both of you are worrying about the morning rush," Kaworu noted as he loosened himself up.  
"我想你们俩都在担心早高峰吧，" 渚薰一边放松身体一边说道。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, and at this time of the year, it's too hard to wake up when the morning's cold."  
真嗣点点头。“是啊，每年这个时候，早上太冷了，很难起床。”

"Ah... I see. I'll wait for both of you instead," Kaworu answered as he went to the kitchen sink and washed his face thoroughly, before he toweled off.  
“啊……我明白了。那我就等你们两个吧。”薰回答道，他走到厨房水槽边，彻底洗了把脸，然后用毛巾擦干。

"Hey, that's Asuka's towel," Shinji remarked, recognizing to whom the red monogrammed towel belonged to, but in a flash he also remembered the girl scolding him.  
“嘿，那是明日香的毛巾，”真嗣注意到毛巾上的红色字母，认出了它的主人，但随即也想起了女孩责备他的情景。

_"So,. you guys are staring at me, right?" Asuka snarled at them. "I'm gonna change clothes but I'll KILL YOU Stooges if you perverts go for another peek!"  
"所以，你们这帮家伙是在盯着我看，对吧？" 明日香对他们咆哮道，"我要换衣服了，但你们这些变态要是敢再偷看，我绝对会宰了你们！"_

_"Hello! Are you there, you idiot? Hello!" Asuka mocked into his ear as she tapped the top of his head with her fist. "This is ME saying a big HELLO to you, 'cause you're such a grumpy sleepyhead!"  
"喂！你在吗，你这个笨蛋？喂！" 明日香一边用拳头轻敲他的头顶，一边在他耳边嘲讽道，"这是我，在向你大声问好，因为你总是这么爱发脾气的瞌睡虫！"_

Oddly, Shinji wished that Asuka was here again, bringing more color to his mornings despite her mockery, before Kaworu looked back at him.  
奇怪的是，真嗣希望明日香能再次出现，尽管她的嘲讽不断，却为他的早晨增添了更多色彩，直到渚薰再次看向他。

"Sorry, I couldn't find yours," he apologized as he hung the towel upon his shoulders, while looking for a coffee mug. However he saw Shinji's spaced-out facial expression. "What's wrong? Something got into you?" Kaworu asked, snapping Shinji out of his reverie.  
"抱歉，我没找到你的，" 他边道歉边将毛巾搭在肩上，同时寻找着咖啡杯。然而他注意到了真嗣恍惚的表情。"怎么了？有什么事吗？" 薰问道，把真嗣从沉思中唤醒。

"No... No, it's nothing... I'm okay," Shinji answered, shaking his head before he pointed out the cabinet above the sink that kept the morning concoctions. "The tea, coffee, sugar and creamer are all inside," he informed.  
"不... 不，没什么... 我没事，" 真嗣回答，摇了摇头，然后指向水槽上方的橱柜，那里存放着早晨的饮品。"茶、咖啡、糖和奶精都在里面，" 他告知。

Kaworu pleasantly nodded, completely unmindful of this frantic morning rush as he took out one of the coffee mugs from the cupboard, each of the mugs inscribed with the red NERV emblem.  
薰愉快地点头，完全不在意这忙碌的早晨，他从橱柜里拿出一个咖啡杯，每个杯子上都刻着红色的 NERV 标志。

"Thanks. I need a good, clean eye-opener to start my day," he told back.  
“谢谢。我需要一杯提神醒脑的好咖啡来开启新的一天。”他回应道。

As Kaworu quickly prepared himself some coffee instead of tea, he looked forward to this day's labors. _This should be an interesting day,_ he briefly reflected, before taking the first sip of his brew.  
碇真嗣迅速为自己准备了一杯咖啡而非茶，期待着今天的任务。他短暂地想，这应该会是有趣的一天，然后便啜饮起第一口咖啡。

After forty tire-smoking minutes, the three late-comers were running through the long corridor within NERV Headquarters, leading to the Eva cages, their shoes clattering on the tiled floor as they sprinted furiously, hoping to make it just in time.  
经过四十分钟轮胎冒烟般的疾驰，三位迟到者正沿着 NERV 总部内通往 EVA 格纳库的长廊狂奔，他们的鞋在瓷砖地面上发出急促的响声，拼命冲刺，希望能及时赶到。

"I should've known... Oh, my, I should've known..." Misato mumbled, fuming between her shallow breaths, while the two boys talked about Kaworu's sync test debut.  
"我早该知道的...哦，天哪，我早该知道的..." 美里喃喃自语，在浅浅的呼吸间怒火中烧，而两个男孩正在谈论着薰的同步测试首秀。

"What was your sync rate yesterday?" Shinji asked while Kaworu ran by his side.  
"你昨天的同步率是多少？" 真嗣问道，而薰在他身旁跑着。

"I was told that I achieved a 75 percent sync rate," Kaworu informed.  
"我被告知达到了 75%的同步率，" 薰告知。

"Whoa... You did 75 percent within a normal sync test?" Shinji awed.  
"哇...你在常规同步测试中达到了 75%？" 真嗣惊叹道。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I did it, my friend. Not much of a big deal."  
渚薰点头。"是的，我做到了，我的朋友。没什么大不了的。"

"Impossible... It took us quite a hard time to reach that," Shinji remarked, briefly taken aback by Kaworu's momentous yet uncelebrated achievement.  
"不可能...我们费了好大劲才达到那个水平，" 真嗣评论道，短暂地被渚薰这一重大却未被庆祝的成就所震惊。

"And so did I," Kaworu added another of his lies to level the playing field. "I spent three years trying to get there."  
"我也一样，" 渚薰又撒了一个谎，以平衡局面。"我花了三年时间试图到达那里。"

"Not very easy to do 75 percent... But at one point I came close to 400 percent," Shinji admitted.  
"达到 75%并不容易... 但有一次我差点达到了 400%，" 真嗣承认道。"

Kaworu gaped. "400 percent..." he mumbled.  
渚薰目瞪口呆。"400%..." 他喃喃自语。

Unfortunately, Rei Ayanami was walking in the same direction towards the boys.  
不幸的是，绫波零正朝着男孩们的方向走去。

_Kaworu... I would like to talk,_ she reflected as she stepped into the intersection, unaware of the boys' arrival, her left foot sticking out first just round the corner...  
渚薰……我想谈谈，她一边想着一边踏入十字路口，未察觉到男孩们的到来，左脚先伸出，刚好拐过街角……

Suddenly, Shinji saw her foot and gasped. "Kaworu, watch out!" he warned.  
突然，真嗣看到了她的脚，倒吸一口气。“渚薰，小心！”他警告道。

"What?" Kaworu blurted out, but it was too late as his sneakers caught onto her foot.  
"什么？" 渚薰脱口而出，但为时已晚，他的运动鞋勾住了她的脚。

"Ah!" Rei cried, unexpectedly taken by surprise by Kaworu's appearance.  
"啊！" 绫波零惊呼，没想到会被渚薰的出现吓了一跳。

"Oops..." Kaworu yelped as he went down with Rei, before the two Children finally landed onto the floor.  
"哎呀..." 渚薰惊叫着与绫波零一同倒下，两个孩子最终摔在了地板上。

_**BAM!**_

Misato suddenly stopped in mid-stride and was dumbfounded by their collision. "What the...?" she stammered.  
美里突然在半途中停下脚步，被他们的碰撞惊得目瞪口呆。“什么鬼……？”她结巴道。

Shinji blinked at the couple sprawled on the floor. "Ayanami... what are you doing here? Are you all right?"  
真嗣对着躺在地上的两人眨了眨眼。“绫波……你怎么在这里？你还好吗？”

On his knees and painfully nursing his head, Kaworu groaned while Rei was sitting half a meter away at the corridor wall, her blue skirt riding higher than her knees as she rubbed her forehead.  
跪在地上痛苦地揉着头的薰呻吟着，而丽则坐在走廊墙边半米远的地方，蓝色的裙子比膝盖还高，她揉着额头。

Blinking, Kaworu nodded, wincing from the pain as he got up. "I... I'm all right, ma'am. Is she okay?" he answered, trying to banish the stars from his eyes.  
眨了眨眼，渚薰点头起身，因疼痛而皱眉。“我……我没事，女士。她还好吗？”他回答道，试图驱散眼前的金星。

In unison, they all glanced up at Rei, who nodded back, telling them that she was indeed fine. At the same time, she was flushed with a slight tinge of pink on her face. Without hesitation, she hid her thighs away from the two boys and their disbelieving commanding officer.  
他们齐齐抬头看向绫波，她点头回应，表明自己确实无恙。与此同时，她的脸颊泛起一抹淡淡的粉红。她毫不犹豫地将双腿藏起，不让那两个男孩和他们的指挥官看到。

"I am fine, Major," Rei quietly replied, despite her aching forehead. With complete reserve, she straightened herself and tried to get up on her wobbly feet.  
“我没事，少校。”绫波轻声回答，尽管额头隐隐作痛。她完全镇定下来，挺直身子，试图站稳摇晃的双脚。

Kaworu extended his hand gallantly, supporting the disconcerted young lady as she began to rise. "I'm sorry, Rei. We didn't know that you're coming our way," he profusely apologized as he gently supported her.  
渚薰优雅地伸出手，扶住了有些慌乱的年轻女士，帮助她起身。“对不起，绫波。我们不知道你会过来，”他一边温柔地扶着她，一边连声道歉。

"It is nothing... I am also sorry that I was thinking too much," Rei admitted, finally able to prop herself against the wall.  
“没什么……我也为我想得太多而道歉，”绫波终于承认，并靠在墙上支撑自己。

Kaworu nodded before he stared into Rei's eyes.  
渚薰点点头，然后凝视着绫波的眼睛。

She blinked pleadingly, a flicker of emotion in her cerise eyes as if she was asking for help, and evidently in his thoughts, he swore to himself that he felt the maelstrom of confusion within Rei's soul.  
她恳求地眨了眨眼，紫红色的眼眸中闪过一丝情感，仿佛在寻求帮助，显然在他的思绪中，他暗自发誓感受到了丽灵魂中混乱的风暴。

_I couldn't say this, but it looks like that you really need some help,_ Kaworu wondered. _Are you struggling to find the answers to your existence or your purpose?_  
我不能这么说，但看起来你真的需要一些帮助，渚薰心想。你是在苦苦寻找自己存在的答案还是目的呢？

As for Rei, there was also something about Kaworu at the moment they made physical contact, and pondered for a second or two.  
至于丽，当他们身体接触的那一刻，她也察觉到了渚薰的某些特质，并沉思了一两秒钟。

_Is this... the real Kaworu I have felt from his touch?  
这是... 我通过他的触摸感受到的真正的渚薰吗？_

_He could be hiding something... However... he also seemed to be willing to help me...  
他可能隐藏了什么... 然而... 他也似乎愿意帮助我..._

"Hey, we have to go," Shinji informed him, tapping Kaworu's shoulder and snapping out the ashen-haired boy from his daze, while Misato nodded in confirmation. Kaworu promptly let go of Rei's forearm.  
“嘿，我们得走了，”真嗣告诉他，轻拍渚薰的肩膀，让灰发少年从恍惚中回过神来，而美里点头确认。渚薰随即放开了绫波的手腕。

"Mister Nagisa, we've got only five minutes before both of you are strapped in," Misato reminded.  
"渚先生，你们只剩下五分钟就要被固定好了，"美里提醒道。

"Are you coming with us?" he asked Rei.  
"你要和我们一起去吗？"他问丽。

Rei nodded, already out of her dazed pain. "Yes. I want to observe how well you do as a Pilot," she finally answered as she rubbed her ached forehead instinctively.  
丽点点头，已经从恍惚的疼痛中恢复过来。"是的。我想观察你作为驾驶员的表现如何，"她最终回答道，同时本能地揉着疼痛的额头。

"I thought you're scheduled for a test. Any change of plans?" Misato asked the young woman.  
"我以为你安排了测试。计划有变吗？" 美里问那位年轻女子。

"Yes, Major," Rei admitted. "I have checked my work schedule for this morning, but there are no activities for me until tomorrow."  
"是的，少校，" 绫波承认道，"我查看了今早的工作安排，但直到明天我都没有活动。"

"I see..." Misato agreed before she turned her attention at Kaworu and Shinji. "Okay guys, let's go! We've got no time to spare!" she ordered the two boys.  
"我明白了..." 美里同意后，将注意力转向了薰和真嗣。"好了，小伙子们，我们走吧！时间紧迫！" 她向两个男孩命令道。

---

"Okay, boys... Now listen up," Misato told them through the comlink as she watched from the comfort of the control room, getting Shinji's and Kaworu's attention instantly while they were aboard their respective Evas. The First Children was watching attentively at the activity around them.  
"好了，小伙子们...现在听好了，"美里通过通讯器告诉他们，她正舒适地坐在控制室里，观察着真嗣和薰分别在各自的 Eva 上的情况。第一适格者正专注地观察着周围的动静。

In front of Misato and Rei, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki and the bridge technicians were ready to witness the computer-simulated fireworks to light up before them with Kaworu's demonstration of his combat skills. At the same time, the MAGI was in the process of uploading the precisely-detailed digital battlefield and the full simulacrum of the Third Angel.  
在美里和绫波面前，副司令冬月和桥上的技术人员们准备见证计算机模拟的烟花在眼前绽放，这是薰展示其战斗技巧的演示。与此同时，MAGI 系统正在上传精确详尽的数字战场和第三使徒的全息模拟。

"As usual, this is a standard combat exercise, so within two minutes you have to terminate the target. Outflank and hit him with what you've got, until you weaken his AT Field and take him down completely," she informed. "Is that understood?"  
"像往常一样，这是一次标准的战斗演练，所以你们必须在两分钟内消灭目标。迂回包抄并用你们所掌握的技能攻击他，直到削弱他的 AT 力场并彻底击倒他，"她告知。"明白了吗？"

"Roger," both Children responded in unison, as they gripped their butterfly handles with their fingers over the triggers, ready for action.  
“罗杰，”两个孩子齐声回应，手指紧扣蝴蝶形把手上的扳机，准备行动。

Misato nodded. "Good hunting. Now go!" she commanded.  
美里点头。“祝狩猎顺利。现在出发！”她命令道。

In the world of the virtual battlefield, both Evas cocked their bull-pup Pallet Rifles and unlocked the safeties as they walked out of the giant electromagnet-propelled elevators and into the welter of buildings of the city.  
在虚拟战场的世界里，两台 EVA 举起他们的 Bull-pup 式弹匣步枪，解锁保险，从巨大的电磁弹射电梯中走出，步入城市的建筑群中。

"Well?" Shinji asked Kaworu, who was in the process of making Unit-02 kneel down on one leg while he checked the fire control system.  
"怎么样？" 真嗣问卡罗，后者正在让初号机单膝跪地，同时检查火控系统。

"This is a very typical mission, my friend. But somebody said that 'slow is smooth, and smooth is fast', so we may have to apply this principle correctly," Kaworu remarked.  
"这是一次非常典型的任务，我的朋友。但有人说过，'慢即是稳，稳即是快'，所以我们可能得正确运用这一原则，" 卡罗评论道。

"Good advice. You go to the left side, while I'll flank it from the right," Shinji replied, as he slowly let Unit-01 walk slowly under the cover of the skyscrapers, aiming his weapon where the targeted Angel would appear in a moment's notice.  
"好建议。你去左边，我从右边包抄，" 真嗣回答，同时让初号机在摩天大楼的掩护下缓慢行进，瞄准即将出现的使徒，随时准备开火。

"A classic pincers maneuver, right?" Kaworu asked.  
"经典的钳形战术，对吧？" 渚薰问道。

"Yeah, that's what I'm saying," Shinji agreed.  
"没错，我就是这个意思，" 真嗣赞同道。

Under Kaworu's control, Eva-02 stealthily moved through the concrete maze, careful not to step into an unsuspecting house or vehicle beneath its crimson mass as he pointed his weapon and swept the perimeter, prepared for the inevitable with a full clip of tungsten-tipped 120mm rounds.  
在渚薰的操控下，Eva-02 悄无声息地穿过混凝土迷宫，小心翼翼地避免踩进那些未察觉的房屋或车辆，其庞大的赤红色身躯之下，他手持武器，扫视着四周，准备着不可避免的战斗，弹匣里装满了钨尖的 120 毫米子弹。

The forward-looking Doppler radar system installed into Unit-01's head showed Shinji a blue blip on the display. Assisting the weapon guidance system of the Eva with added lethal precision were two geostationary NERV targeting and navigation satellites high above the Earth's surface, pinpointing the Angel's position by a margin of error no greater than the width of typewriting paper, far more accurately than the GPS satellites used by most military forces.  
安装在初号机头部的前瞻性多普勒雷达系统向真嗣展示了一个显示屏上的蓝色光点。辅助 Eva 武器引导系统的是两颗位于地球表面上方的高轨道 NERV 目标定位和导航卫星，它们以不超过打字纸宽度的误差精确锁定使徒的位置，远比大多数军事力量使用的 GPS 卫星更为准确。

"About 3,000 meters, Kaworu, and closing," Shinji informed, while trying not to let his battle nervousness overcome his guts.  
“大约 3000 米，薰，正在接近，”真嗣报告道，同时努力不让自己的战斗紧张压倒勇气。

Kaworu nodded. "Roger, and I have contact," he noted, now concentrating all of his thoughts at the lumbering Third Angel coming into their view. The targeting cursor locked upon his fast-moving prey on the heads-up display, and it was indeed a huge, ugly and an unforgiving agent of destruction.  
薰点头。“收到，我已经锁定目标，”他注视着逐渐进入视野的笨重第三使徒，全神贯注。瞄准光标锁定在抬头显示器上快速移动的猎物，这确实是一个庞大、丑陋且毫不留情的毁灭使者。

_I'm sorry, brethren,_ Kaworu apologetically thought for a second as he looked at the analog of Sachiel, rushing to meet Unit-01 once again, _but I have to fight you, just to show to these Lilim that I'm one of them for this time being..._  
抱歉，兄弟们，碇真嗣在心中默念，目光投向正急速迎战初号机的萨基尔模拟体，但我必须与你战斗，只为向这些人类证明，此时此刻，我也是他们中的一员……

"I got a tone!" Shinji noted loudly, a loud ring indicating a full-blown WAVELENGTH BLUE signal at close combat range. "That thing's moving fast!"  
“我收到了信号！”真嗣大声说道，一阵响亮的铃声表明在近距离战斗范围内出现了全开的 WAVELENGTH BLUE 信号。“那东西移动得真快！”

"Okay. Let's get ready," Kaworu answered, as Unit-02's massive fingers closed onto the grip of its rifle.  
“好，准备就绪。”真嗣回应道，零号机巨大的手指紧握住步枪的握把。

"Yeah! And damn it, I'll fix this one!" Shinji yelled out this time and he fired away, unleashing a full-automatic volley of bullets into the Angel as it made its charge towards him and Unit-01. He swore that his rectum tightened up, while his pulse rate racketed up a notch.  
“耶！该死的，这次我一定要搞定它！”真嗣这次大喊着，随即开火，向着冲向他和初号机的使徒倾泻出一连串全自动的子弹。他发誓自己的肛门都紧缩了，心跳也加快了一拍。

"Take him down!" Misato immediately barked.  
“干掉它！”美里立刻命令道。

"Roger!" Shinji shot back, but for a second, he remembered his first training sessions he did almost a year ago.  
“收到！”真嗣回应道，但有那么一瞬间，他想起了将近一年前自己的第一次训练课程。

_Aim at the target in the center and pull the trigger,_ he recalled before emptying his rifle rounds at a high cyclic rate of fire. Tracer rounds, which were inserted for every five cartridges in the clip, zipped across the city in neat, bright lines.  
瞄准中心目标，扣动扳机，他回忆着，随即以高速连发射击清空了步枪弹匣。每隔五发子弹插入的曳光弹，在城市上空划出整齐明亮的线条，疾速穿梭。

From his cockpit, Kaworu witnessed the whistling rounds plink into the Angel's AT-Field, hexagons of orange light flashing where the hurtling pieces of metal impacted.  
从驾驶舱中，薰目睹了呼啸的子弹击打在使徒的 AT 力场上，橙色光芒的六边形在飞溅的金属碎片撞击处闪烁。

Finger on the trigger and prepared to make his move, Kaworu contemplated for a small moment, thinking first of Asuka.  
手指搭在扳机上，准备行动，薰短暂沉思，首先想到了明日香。

_You may be somewhere else now, but... I swear I could feel the hurt that you've left inside the plug. I wonder why you had to put up with so much energy to bury your past and keeping up a façade of deception...  
你现在或许身处别处，但...我发誓我能感受到你留在插入栓里的痛苦。我不明白你为何要耗费如此多的精力去埋葬过去，维持一个欺骗的假象..._

_Asuka, I'm sorry for you if you don't want me to control this beast, but I have to take care of your Eva for now.  
明日香，如果你不希望我控制这头野兽，我为你感到抱歉，但眼下我必须照顾好你的 EVA。_

And then there was another sensation within the plug, as if someone else other than Asuka had rode Unit-02. He glanced around, wondering where this sensation came from.  
接着，插入栓内又传来另一种感觉，仿佛除了明日香之外还有其他人驾驶过二号机。他环顾四周，疑惑这种感觉从何而来。

_Could it be... your mother, Asuka? Persuading you to suffer? And then you must die with her?  
会不会是...你的母亲，明日香？劝你承受痛苦？然后你必须与她一同死去？_

There were pleading, desperate voices, or so Kaworu thought that he heard them inside the plug.  
有恳求的、绝望的声音，至少真嗣认为他在插入栓内听到了这些。

_"Look at me.... Mama, please... don't stop being my mother..." Asuka pleaded as she cried, while the Angel above the Earth shone its seemingly harmless light upon Unit-02 and its humiliated pilot.  
“看着我....妈妈，请...不要停止做我的母亲...”明日香哭着恳求，而地球上方的使徒则以其看似无害的光芒照耀着 02 号机及其羞辱的驾驶员。_

_"Please, my dear... come to heaven with me," her mother persuaded, her head hidden in the shadows.  
"亲爱的，请跟我一起上天堂吧，" 她的母亲劝说道，头隐藏在阴影中。_

_"Die with me..." "和我一起死吧……"_

_"Mama, Mama... Please, don't kill me! NO! I am not Mama's doll. I will think for myself and I will live on my own.... I don't need Daddy or Mama... I will live alone!"  
"妈妈，妈妈……求求你，别杀我！不！我不是妈妈的玩偶。我会自己思考，我会独立生活……我不需要爸爸或妈妈……我会独自活下去！"_

_"Die with me..." "和我一起死..."_

_Asuka curled into a ball and tried to shield her head from the Angel's punishing mind-rape. "No! Don't make me remember such things! I want to forget, but don't look into my mind! I don't want to remember such terrible things! Stop... STOP! DON'T KILL ME!"  
明日香蜷缩成一团，试图从使徒残酷的心灵强暴中保护自己的头部。"不！不要让我回忆这些！我想忘记，但不要窥探我的内心！我不想记起这些可怕的事情！停下来...停下！别杀我！"_

_"Help me! That thing's raping me! Kaji! What should I do? WHAT SHOULD I DO? HELP ME!" Asuka screamed as she panicked.  
""救救我！那东西在强暴我！加持！我该怎么办？我该怎么办？救救我！"" 明日香惊慌失措地尖叫着。_

Kaworu shuddered for a moment, but realizing that was going to affect his combat skills, he quickly shook off his pained feelings about the former occupants of this entry plug. Instead he focused his thoughts on Shinji as he watched Unit-01 and the Angel coming close to blows.  
渚薰颤抖了一瞬，但意识到这会影响他的战斗能力，他迅速摆脱了对这个插入栓前主人的痛苦情感。相反，他将思绪集中在真嗣身上，观察着初号机与使徒即将交锋的情景。

_Friend, I would like to see if you have taken my advice in practice... and how far you're going to think and do.  
朋友，我想看看你是否将我的建议付诸实践...以及你能思考和行动到什么程度。_

_I want to see you fight... show me what you're really made of... if you can make the difference between being a man and a boy.  
我想看你战斗...展示你的真正实力...如果你能区分男人与男孩的差别。_

And he let Unit-02 kneel down to aim. With a few corrections, tracking the Angel's movement through the crosshairs, the red Eva quickly fired off two concentrated bursts, and more of the bullets ricocheted off the Angel's Field.  
他让二号机跪下瞄准。经过几次调整，通过瞄准镜追踪使徒的移动，红色 EVA 迅速发射了两轮密集的子弹，更多的子弹在使徒的力场中弹开。

Distracted and suddenly angered, the Angel swerved around to face Unit-02 and tore forward, hissing and growling with fury as it smashed several office buildings and churned up concrete and earth in its wake.  
使徒分心并突然愤怒起来，转身面对二号机，咆哮着冲向前，愤怒地摧毁了几座办公楼，在其身后扬起了混凝土和泥土。

With the Angel diverted from him, Shinji ramped up Unit-01's AT-Field up to where his sync rate could allow before he took off, heading for the Angel's core. By the power of thought, Shinji got Unit-01 to pull out the Progress Knife from its pauldron housing, and the huge blade instantly shimmered with a glowing pink.  
随着使徒被引开，真嗣将初号机的 AT 力场提升到同步率允许的最大值，然后起飞，直奔使徒的核心。通过意念之力，真嗣让初号机从肩甲中抽出进步之刃，巨大的刀刃瞬间闪烁着粉红色的光芒。

_I'm not going to... I'm not going to back out,_ he resolved as he and the Eva ran in unison like the divine wind.  
我不会...我不会退缩的，他坚定地想着，与 Eva 如神风般并肩奔跑。

_I want to prove myself again... I want to be what I am... I want to believe in myself once more... I don't want to worry about the people who hate me...  
我想再次证明自己...我想做回真正的我...我想再次相信自己...我不想再担心那些讨厌我的人..._

_I want to try to be one with the pain.  
我想尝试与痛苦融为一体。_

Still blasting away the Angel's AT-Field with more bullets at a higher rate of fire, Kaworu never even blinked in the strobe-like effect of rifle fire shining on his pale face, as his ugly opponent began to raise its massive arms upwards, preparing to smash its blood-red bipedal antagonist.  
依旧以更高射速的子弹猛烈轰击着使徒的 AT 力场，在闪光灯般的步枪射击光影下，渚薰连眼都没眨一下，而他那丑陋的对手开始抬起巨大的双臂，准备向其血红色的双足对手砸去。

But the Angel never noticed the other Eva behind its back, as Shinji jammed the Prog Knife hard and fast, ripping through the AT-Field and all the way to the reddish core. He could also hear the squishing blood-wet sound of the ionized blade cutting into flesh. The Third Children screamed, clenching his teeth hard as he drove the Knife even deeper into the core.  
但使徒并未察觉到身后的另一台 EVA，真嗣迅猛地将进度之刃刺入，穿透 AT 力场直抵那红褐色的核心。他还能听到离子化刀刃切入血肉之躯的湿漉声响。第三适格者嘶吼着，紧咬牙关，将刀刃更深地推入核心。

As though his inner rage had shattered the Angel's strength, the menacing creature arched backwards, pivoting around for a moment as Unit-01 let go of that beast, pulling out the energized blade from the shattered core, before the Angel finally crashed down into several abandoned houses with a huge explosion of dust and splinters.  
仿佛内心的愤怒击溃了使徒的力量，那凶猛的生物向后弓起，短暂地旋转了一圈，初号机松开了那怪物，从破碎的核心中抽出充能刀刃，随后使徒终于坠入几座废弃房屋，激起一片尘埃与碎片的大爆炸。

In shallow breaths, Shinji looked forward just in time for Kaworu and Unit-02 to let go of what was left of his rifle, tossing his now-empty weapon away as the cloud of debris was cleared by the breeze.  
在浅浅的呼吸中，真嗣向前看去，正好看到渚薰和二号机放开了他那支残破的步枪，将他现在空无一物的武器抛开，微风拂过，吹散了那团尘埃。

"Now this is what teamwork is all about," Kaworu remarked as he willed the red Eva to get up on its feet. "I owe you one, my friend."  
“这才是团队合作的真谛，”渚薰说道，同时让红色的 EVA 站起身来。“我欠你一个人情，我的朋友。”

Sighing in relief, Shinji nodded before he turned to Misato. "Target destroyed," he reported.  
松了一口气，真嗣点点头，然后转向美里。“目标已摧毁，”他报告道。

"I got you, kid. Return to base, guys," Misato ordered.  
"我抓住你了，孩子。返回基地，大家，" 美里命令道。

"Roger," Kaworu and Shinji answered in unison.  
"收到，" 渚薰和真嗣齐声回答。

---

The results were satisfactory enough for the two Children. According to the MAGI, out of 231 rifle rounds they expended during the simulated two-minute sortie, about 78 percent of the rounds hit the target near or directly, while the remainders were misses.  
对于这两名少年来说，结果相当令人满意。根据 MAGI 的数据显示，在模拟的两分钟出击中，他们发射的 231 发步枪子弹中，约有 78%的子弹命中了目标附近或直接命中，而其余的则是未命中。

Collateral damage in the same battle was likely to be at least nine medium-sized office buildings, two defensive structures, three armament buildings, fifteen homes and twenty-four vehicles, amounting to an estimated 36.2 million US dollars for battle damage repair and other expenses.  
同一场战斗中的间接损失可能包括至少九座中型办公楼、两座防御工事、三座军械库、十五户住宅和二十四辆车，预计战斗损害修复及其他费用总计达 3620 万美元。

As for their performance, Shinji acquired a 32% sync ratio, about 6% higher than the last time, while Kaworu achieved an additional 3% to the 75% he racked up yesterday.  
至于他们的表现，真嗣的同步率达到了 32%，比上次提高了约 6%，而渚则比昨天的 75%又增加了 3%。

"Not bad, considering that you've just arrived yesterday," Misato remarked at Kaworu as they walked out of the locker room. "But... Sorry, Doctor Akagi isn't here to see your first-time combat performance."  
“考虑到你昨天才刚到，表现不错了。”美里对渚说道，他们正从更衣室走出来。“但是……抱歉，赤木博士不在，没能看到你第一次的战斗表现。”

While running his hand through his ashen-colored hair, Kaworu nodded. "I agree, ma'am. She would've been impressed."  
卡沃鲁将手穿过他灰色的头发，点头道：“我同意，女士。她一定会印象深刻的。”

"I heard you saying that 'slow is smooth, smooth is fast' thing. Where did you hear about it?" she queried.  
“我听到你说‘慢即是稳，稳即是快’那句话。你从哪儿听来的？”她询问道。

Kaworu shrugged. "It was just what I heard from someone, ma'am."  
卡沃鲁耸了耸肩。“只是听某个人说的，女士。”

"Well, you reminded me of what Asuka told me a few months back," Shinji mentioned as he straightened out his shirt.  
"嗯，你让我想起了几个月前明日香告诉我的话，" 真嗣说着整理了一下自己的衬衫。

"What is it, my friend?" Kaworu asked.  
"怎么了，我的朋友？" 渚薰问道。

Shinji sheepishly smiled at the memory of that day. "She said that combat must always be elegant and without waste. Anyway, we almost got wasted."  
真嗣腼腆地笑了笑，回忆起那天的情景。"她说战斗必须总是优雅且不浪费。总之，我们差点就完蛋了。"

Kaworu shook his head, grinning. "I see," he agreed, before a slight frown crossed his face. "But, wait a minute. Where's Rei?"  
渚薰摇了摇头，笑着说：“我明白了，”随即眉头微微一皱，“但是，等一下。绫波在哪里？”

"She walked out of the control room at the last minute. I think she's going to visit the Commander again," Misato informed, before she guessed aloud again. "Nah. Perhaps she's gone to eat lunch instead. Now let's visit Asuka, shall we?"  
“她在最后一刻走出了控制室。我想她又要去见司令了，”美里告知，然后又大声猜测道，“不，也许她去吃午饭了。现在我们去看看明日香，好吗？”

Shinji nodded before they all walked away.  
真嗣点点头，然后他们一起离开了。

Unknown to the other Children and their commanding officer, Rei was now in the Headquarters Library, perusing one of the computers there, trying to find an online encyclopedia article about amnesia.  
其他孩子们和他们的指挥官并不知情，丽现在正在总部图书馆里，使用其中一台电脑，试图查找关于失忆的在线百科文章。

Among the articles, she found the following entry:  
在众多文章中，她发现了以下条目：

_**Amnesia – defined as loss or impairment of memory:**_ _Amnesia is usually associated with some form of brain damage, but it may also be caused by severe psychological trauma... Retrograde amnesia refers to difficulties in recalling or recognizing past events and experiences. It typically accompanies anterograde amnesia and is especially common following concussive head injury. A person with retrograde amnesia has trouble remembering recent events, events from further in the past, or both..._  
失忆症——定义为记忆丧失或记忆障碍：失忆症通常与某种形式的脑损伤有关，但也可能是由严重的心理创伤引起的...逆行性失忆症指的是难以回忆或识别过去的事件和经历。它通常伴随顺行性失忆症出现，并且在脑震荡性头部损伤后尤为常见。患有逆行性失忆症的人难以记住近期的事件、更久远的事件，或两者皆有...

Rei sighed softly after she closed the online encyclopedia, realizing that it would be very difficult for her to recall certain events in her past, except maybe when she was in the Infirmary.  
丽关闭了在线百科全书后轻轻叹了口气，意识到她要回忆起过去某些事件将会非常困难，除了可能在医务室时的记忆。

_How can I remember,_ she pondered, _now that I found out that I could not do so?_  
我怎能记得，她思索着，既然我已经发现我无法做到这一点？

Indeed, the doctors only told Rei that she survived the explosion with minor injuries and no head trauma, without telling her the exact details or its circumstances.  
实际上，医生们只告诉丽她因爆炸仅受轻伤且未遭受头部创伤而幸存，并未透露具体细节或事件经过。

Passing more minutes, Rei read more articles and journals relating to amnesia, but they all told her the same hopeless information: there was no other known medical method of treatment to bring back her lost memories.  
随着时间一分一秒流逝，丽阅读了更多关于失忆的文章和期刊，但它们都传达了同样令人绝望的信息：目前没有其他已知的医疗方法能恢复她失去的记忆。

Dejected by her failure, Rei promptly turned off the computer in front of her, before she rose stoically up from her seat and left the Library.  
因失败而沮丧，丽立刻关掉了面前的电脑，然后坚毅地从座位上站起来，离开了图书馆。

Meanwhile, in one of the cells within the Stockade, a disheveled, greatly depressed Ritsuko Akagi was sitting on a folding chair, smoking her only remaining stick of Seven Stars Lights down to its butt. What put her in this Godforsaken place wasn't the ostensibly criminal charge of embezzling of operational funds, but the destruction of the Dummy Plug project.  
与此同时，在看守所的一个牢房里，凌乱不堪、极度沮丧的赤木律子坐在折叠椅上，抽着她仅剩的一根七星烟，直到烟蒂。让她陷入这个该死之地的原因并非表面上挪用运营资金的罪名，而是破坏了 Dummy Plug 项目。

Ritsuko recalled the conversation between her and the Committee of SEELE.  
律子回想起她和 SEELE 委员会之间的对话。

_In the darkness, the cabal surrounded her with their stark-numbered monoliths, masking whatever facial identity they carried. SEELE 01, the avataric, glowing alias of Keel Lorenz, seemed to stare at her as if it had eyes.  
在黑暗中，那些戴着面具的阴谋家们围绕着她，身边是刻着数字的黑色石碑，掩盖了他们的真实面容。SEELE 01，基尔·洛伦兹的化身，闪烁着光芒的代号，仿佛用目光凝视着她。_

_"We apologize for this, but we wish to proceed with a short briefing for you," Keel advised her, "And we have no intent to insult your integrity, Doctor."  
“我们为此道歉，但我们希望为您进行一次简短的简报，”基尔向她建议道，“我们无意冒犯您的正直，博士。”_

_Stark naked, Ritsuko rose stiffly from her metallic seat in the middle of the circle. "Gentlemen, I have nothing to hide," she answered flatly, but deep inside she felt somewhat humiliated by being glared down by those black faceless monoliths.  
赤身裸体，赤木律子僵硬地从圆圈中央的金属座椅上站起身来。“先生们，我没有什么可隐瞒的，”她平淡地回答，但内心深处却因被那些黑色无面的巨石瞪视而感到些许屈辱。_

_Keel mumbled in satisfaction at the way she spoke. "You are such an obstinate woman, Doctor Akagi," he said. "It is quite natural for Ikari to keep you close to him. However, it is none other than Ikari himself who delivered you to us."  
基尔对她的说话方式低声表示满意。“你真是个固执的女人，赤木博士，”他说，“伊卡利将你留在他身边是很自然的。然而，正是伊卡利本人将你交给了我们。”_

_Ritsuko blinked. "Pardon me?"_

_"We wish to question the pilot of Unit 00," Keel informed her, "However, Ikari has chosen you as the substitute for the First Children, Doctor Akagi."  
"我们希望询问零号机的驾驶员，"基尔向她说明，"然而，碇司令已选定你作为第一适任者的替代，赤木博士。"_

_"I... I am Ayanami's substitute?"  
"我...我是绫波的替代者？"_

_"Yes," Keel confirmed. "That is all we need to say, so we will let you go for now. We thank you for your full cooperation regarding this matter, Doctor."  
"是的，"基尔确认道。"我们该说的已经说完了，现在就让你离开。感谢你对此事的全力配合，赤木博士。"_

And then she remembered her actions against the other Reis deep below the Geofront, as she flicked away what was left of her cigarette.  
然后她想起了自己在地表之下对其他丽所做的那些事，她弹了弹手指，将剩下的烟蒂甩掉。

Ritsuko destroyed those clones, as they have partly brought forth very bitter memories of her mother surrounded by a pool of blood, limbs splayed outward in an imitation of crucifixion: wide, glassy eyes as though reflecting on her final gesture.  
律子摧毁了那些克隆体，因为它们部分唤起了她母亲被血泊包围、四肢向外张开如同受难般的痛苦记忆：那双空洞的大眼睛，仿佛在回望她最后的举动。

Shaken by the vision of the remains of the disintegrating clones bodies made Ritsuko rush to the nearest bathroom and knelt down before the toilet's maw. She retched hard, expelling everything from her stomach.  
看到那些逐渐消散的克隆体残骸，律子被深深震撼，她冲向最近的洗手间，跪倒在马桶前。她剧烈地呕吐，将胃里的一切都吐了出来。

After she was finished, Ritsuko reflected sadly about what she told Shinji and Misato after destroying the clones. Both of them were greatly shaken by the bloody spectacle.  
事情结束后，律子悲伤地反思着她告诉真嗣和美里关于摧毁克隆体的事。两人都被那血腥的场面深深震撼了。

_Yeah, I know... This is murder... but they're not human; they're just human-looking clones! They may be soulless... and yet I lost against those damned things … I can't win...  
是啊，我知道……这是谋杀……但他们不是人类，只是外表像人的克隆体！他们可能没有灵魂……然而我却输给了那些该死的东西……我赢不了……_

_I can't win!_

_When he's in my mind, I can live with every careless insult and any abuse coming from him.  
当他在我心中时，我可以忍受他任何不经意的侮辱和来自他的任何虐待。_

_I don't care about myself. But he... he did... I knew that... No!  
我不在乎自己。但他...他确实...我知道这一点...不！_

_God, I'm really stupid... I'm so fucking stupid as my mother! Misato, I was made a goddamned fool and played around with!  
天啊，我真的太蠢了...我简直和我妈一样蠢透了！美里，我成了一个该死的傻瓜，被玩弄于股掌之间！_

Tears fell from her eyes, as she shook and sobbed, curling up on the floor. One of her tears passed that distinctive mole on her left cheek before it splashed on the floor melding with its brethren.  
泪水从她的眼中滑落，她颤抖着抽泣，蜷缩在地板上。其中一滴泪珠掠过她左脸颊上那颗独特的痣，随后溅落在地板上，与同伴们融为一体。

"I want to die... I want to die... My God, I can't stand it..." she mumbled, wishing for death as she repeatedly thumped her head softly on the floor as she cried for a few minutes more.  
"我想死...我想死...我的天，我受不了了..."她喃喃自语，渴望死亡，一边轻轻地用头撞击地板，一边又哭泣了几分钟。

In those quiet minutes, she wondered why on earth she got involved with this project, taking either her sanity or even a part of her life... before she slowly crawled up to her cot and rolled in.  
在那寂静的几分钟里，她不禁疑惑自己究竟为何要参与这个项目，这不仅威胁到她的理智，甚至可能夺走她生命的一部分...随后她缓缓爬上自己的床铺，蜷缩起来。

Now laying on the small flat bed and staring at the bare concrete ceiling, Ritsuko pondered hard.  
现在躺在狭小的平板床上，凝视着光秃秃的水泥天花板，律子陷入了深深的思考。

_I wish this wasn't my life,_ she told herself. _I would've preferred to live as an ordinary person instead... I can't keep up with this crap..._  
她对自己说，真希望这不是我的生活。我宁愿过普通人的生活...我实在应付不了这些破事...

The sudden, loud knocking on the cell door snapped Ritsuko out of her thoughts.  
突然响起的敲门声将律子从沉思中惊醒。

"Y... Yes?" she murmured, promptly wiping her face away with the back of her hand, and squinted at the light coming into the cell through the small window.  
“呃……是？”她低声应道，迅速用手背抹了抹脸，眯起眼睛看向从小窗透进牢房的光线。

"The Commander wants to see you," her jailor dryly informed.  
“指挥官要见你，”她的狱卒干巴巴地通知。

At once, Ritsuko scowled, her teeth clenching. _You goddamned son of a bitch..._ she cursed inwardly. Her anger quickly drowned the sorrow in her heart like a sudden flash flood.  
立刻，律子皱起了眉头，牙齿紧咬。你这个该死的混蛋……她在心里咒骂。愤怒如突如其来的洪水，迅速淹没了她心中的悲伤。

The door slid away, to let Gendo Ikari in as he stood by framed by the door.  
门滑开了，让站在门口的源堂·碇得以进入。

Ritsuko slowly rose to her feet, eyes narrowing. "What do you want from me?" she demanded.  
律子缓缓站起身，目光锐利。“你想从我这里得到什么？”她质问道。

Gendo's glasses glinted in the dim light, the tinted lenses camouflaging his eyes, hiding his real intentions. "I want to ask you several questions," he flatly stated as the door closed loudly behind him.  
源堂的眼镜在昏暗的光线下闪烁，有色镜片掩盖了他的眼神，隐藏了他的真实意图。“我有几个问题要问你，”他平淡地陈述着，身后的门重重地关上了。

"Yes, I expected that... Want to know why I destroyed Rei's clones?" she sarcastically answered.  
“是的，我料到了……想知道我为什么销毁零的克隆体吗？”她讽刺地回答。

"The Dummy System," Gendo corrected, preferring the formal title of this small yet very important part of Project E. "Why did you destroy them when the Committee has made you as Rei's deputy?"  
"模拟系统"，碇纠正道，他更喜欢这个小型但极其重要的“E 计划”部分的正式名称。"委员会让你担任绫波的副手，你为什么要毁掉它们？"

Defiantly, Ritsuko walked up a few steps close enough to Gendo, close enough that she could let him hear her words... and maybe slap his face as well.  
里子倔强地走上几级台阶，靠近碇，近到足以让他听到她的话...也许还能扇他一巴掌。

"I don't give one-thirds of a fuck about the Committee!" she angrily spat back, her teeth clenched in rage. "Because I detested the fact that you put Rei first before me, so I have chose to destroy your spares so that I could get my sanity back... Damn you, I let you take me, allowed your hands on my body, and do anything you wanted... And then it turns out that you made me a goddamned lapdog for your little helper... You're such a cold, heartless bas-"  
"我对委员会的看法连三分之一都懒得给！"她愤怒地回呛，牙齿因愤怒而紧咬。"因为我讨厌你把绫波放在我之前的事实，所以我选择毁掉你的备用方案，这样我才能找回理智...该死的，我让你占有我，允许你的手触碰我的身体，任你为所欲为...结果你却让我成了你那小助手的狗腿子...你真是冷酷无情，没心没肺的混蛋-"

A loud slap echoed around the room, as Gendo struck her across the face hard.  
一声响亮的巴掌声在房间内回荡，源渡重重地打了她一耳光。

"I am very disappointed with your actions," Gendo coldly whispered. "Your excuse is no justification of what you did to the Dummy System."  
“我对你的行为非常失望，”源渡冷冷地低语，“你的借口无法为破坏模拟系统的行为开脱。”

But Ritsuko didn't waver, even after the pain on her cheek. "Disappointed? Yes, you're disappointed after all, because you didn't anticipate that from me, and so I threw a monkey wrench into your scenario!"  
但律子并未因脸颊上的疼痛而动摇。“失望？是的，你失望了，因为你没有预料到我会这样做，所以我打乱了你的计划！”

The Commander, his face in a scowl, stared back at the woman with hard, cold eyes veiled behind his tinted glasses.  
指挥官皱着眉头，透过有色眼镜，用冰冷而锐利的目光盯着眼前的女人。

"What you did nearly ruined our schedule," he countered. "It took time and money to prepare these Dummy Plugs, and then you destroyed them because of your petty emotions. That is not acceptable behavior. I expected you to be as professional as your predecessor, and not act like a recalcitrant child."  
"你这么做差点毁了我们的计划，"他反驳道。"准备这些模拟插入栓既费时又费钱，而你却因为一时的情绪把它们毁了。这种行为是不能接受的。我本以为你能像你的前任一样专业，而不是像个倔强的孩子。"

"I'm not going to be like my Mother... dying for nothing!" Ritsuko angrily disagreed.  
"我不想像我母亲那样...白白送死！" 律子愤怒地反驳道。"

Gendo turned away from her in disgust. "It has been a waste of time talking to you, so you shall remain here as long as you hold onto this petulant attitude," he flatly answered.  
源堂厌恶地转过身去。“和你谈话完全是浪费时间，只要你还抱着这种任性的态度，你就得一直待在这里，”他冷冷地回答道。

The Commander gestured to the guard outside to open the door, and without even bothering to look back or say goodbye. The line between him and Ritsuko was now drawn clearly. There was now no going back… for both of them.  
指挥官示意外面的守卫开门，甚至懒得回头或道别。他和律子之间的界限现在已经划得清清楚楚。对他们两人来说，已经没有回头路了……

"Fine... I don't care," Ritsuko shot back, trying not to cry again as she watched him walk out of the cell and literally out of her heart, before the door closed off the rest of the world again.  
“好吧……我不在乎，”律子回击道，努力不让眼泪再次涌出，看着他走出牢房，也彻底走出了她的心，随后门再次关闭，隔绝了外面的世界。

"I have nothing, anyway... You'll get nothing from me, you cold bastard," she added.  
"反正我一无所有...你从我这里什么也得不到，你这个冷酷的混蛋，"她补充道。

---

As the three of them walked along one of the corridors within the Infirmary, unaware of the sad conversation between Akagi and the elder Ikari in the Stockade below, Shinji was talking to Kaworu about Asuka while Misato followed them from behind.  
当他们三人走在医疗室的走廊里，未察觉到下方禁闭室内赤木律子和年长的碇源堂之间悲伤的对话时，真嗣正与渚薰谈论着明日香，而美里则跟在他们身后。

"What was your first impression of her?" Kaworu asked, quite interested.  
"你对她的第一印象是什么？"渚薰颇为感兴趣地问道。

"Well, you should have seen her..." Shinji answered. "Ever since the day she came here, she's someone you could never forget for the rest of your life."  
“唉，你应该见过她的……” 真嗣回答道，“自从她来到这里的那天起，她就成了你一生都无法忘怀的人。”

Kaworu questioned, "How so?"  
薰问道：“怎么说？”

Well... she's loud, proud and very mean, yet she had an inner strength that you have to admire," Shinji remarked flatly, with a hint of care in his voice.  
“嗯……她既吵闹又骄傲，还很刻薄，但她有着一种你必须敬佩的内在力量，” 真嗣平淡地说，语气中带着一丝关切。

"That's what she used to be?"  
"那就是她以前的样子？"

"Yeah, she's the kind of girl who doesn't want to lose," Shinji commented. "Mess with her and you get your ass kicked all over the place."  
"是啊，她就是那种不想输的女孩，" 真嗣评论道。"惹了她，你就等着满地找牙吧。"

Kaworu agreed. "So, she's a perfectionist..."  
渚薰同意道。"这么说，她是个完美主义者..."

Shinji nodded. "She doesn't take no for an answer and that's what she believes in."  
真嗣点头道："她从不接受拒绝，这就是她的信念。"

Finally they came up to Room 303, where a Section Two agent was posted right beside the door, guarding Asuka's room.  
最终他们来到了 303 号房间，门口正站着一名第二分部的特工，守卫着明日香的房间。

"Good morning, Major. Are you going to visit her?" the agent asked, smartly tilting his sunglasses, which looked ridiculous to Kaworu to see them worn inside the Infirmary.  
“早上好，少校。您是来看望她的吗？”特工问道，一边潇洒地推了推他的太阳镜，这在病房内显得颇为滑稽，让渚薰觉得有些可笑。

"Yes," Misato informed, before noting the ID tag clipped on the agent's suit. "Agent Tsutomo Kanzaki," she added while tapping Shinji on the shoulder.  
“是的，”美里回答道，随后注意到特工制服上夹着的身份牌。“特工堤友基，”她补充道，同时拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。

If she could remember correctly from this agent's dossier, Misato knew that the twenty-eight year-old Kanzaki once worked for the national police as a member of the elite Special Assault Team, Japan's professional counter-terrorism unit. He had been a very exceptional, highly-decorated cop in the squad for eight years until a Human Resources Department officer came up to him and asked to join NERV as part of Section Two. Kanzaki welcomed it as an addition to his expertise and experience, and thus he was rewarded by becoming deputy leader of a Special Response Unit, and joint training with other elite forces around the world, including the US Delta Force and Great Britain's Special Air Services.  
如果她没记错这位特工的档案，美里知道这位二十八岁的神崎曾经是国家警察精英突击队的一员，日本专业的反恐单位。他在该小队中是一位非常杰出、屡获殊荣的警察，长达八年之久，直到人力资源部的官员找到他，邀请他加入 NERV 第二部门。神崎欣然接受，将其视为对自己专业技能和经验的补充，因此他被提拔为特别反应小组的副组长，并与包括美国三角洲部队和英国特种空勤团在内的全球其他精英部队进行联合训练。

With such a capability, Section Two's SRUs can handle any hostile situation within the Geofront until further reinforcements from the United Nations and the Japanese Self-Defense Force could come in and help.  
凭借这样的能力，第二部门的 SRU 能够在联合国和日本自卫队增援到来之前，处理地底前线内的任何敌对情况。

But at this moment, Kanzaki was a man doing his job seriously. No glamor, no excitement and certainly no James Bond clichés, as Kanzaki belonged more to the type of protagonists John Le Carre described so eloquently in his spy novels.  
但此刻，神崎正是一个认真履行职责的男人。没有光鲜亮丽，没有激动人心，更没有詹姆斯·邦德式的陈词滥调，神崎更像是约翰·勒卡雷在其间谍小说中描绘得如此传神的那种主角。

"Okay, you may go in, Mister Ikari, but you have only five minutes, even if you're the Commander's son," Kanzaki warned him, as he pointed to his wristwatch to emphasize his point, before the Section Two agent unlocked the door.  
“好吧，碇先生，你可以进去了，但你只有五分钟时间，即便你是司令的儿子，”神崎警告他，指着手表强调他的话，随后第二课的特工打开了门。

Without a word, Shinji slowly entered the room, as Misato and Kaworu watched outside through the observation window.  
没有言语，真嗣缓缓走进房间，而美里和薰则透过观察窗在外面注视着。

---

As he walked towards Asuka, Shinji felt a bit nervous again and swallowed hard. He then glanced down at the unconscious girl, her red hair in a mess, while several wires and tubes snaked across her body and arms. Beside the bed was a simple chair for him to sit on.  
当走向明日香时，真嗣再次感到一丝紧张，艰难地咽了口唾沫。他随即低头看向昏迷的女孩，她的红发凌乱不堪，几根电线和管子蜿蜒穿过她的身体和手臂。床边放着一把简单的椅子供他坐下。

Thinking of the right words to say, amidst of the beeping, rhythmic sounds of the heart and the ECG monitors, Shinji began to whisper into Asuka's ear, but he realized that it would be futile as he sat down on the chair beside her bed.  
在心电监护仪有节奏的哔哔声中，真嗣思索着合适的言辞，开始对着明日香的耳朵低语，但他意识到这样做徒劳无功，便在她床边的椅子上坐了下来。

Instead, Shinji began to speak to Asuka with his thoughts, while flashbacks of the girl came back... from the time he saw her for the first time on the aircraft carrier.  
于是，真嗣开始在心中对明日香倾诉，同时回忆起关于她的片段...从他在航空母舰上第一次见到她的时候开始。

_I... I just want to ask... Why did you run away? Yeah, I guess... I guess that you did run away and tried to kill yourself, because you... you've minds been attacked, reliving those memories you didn't want to, feeling guilty for losing.  
我...我只是想问...你为什么要逃跑？是的，我想...我想你是逃跑了，还试图自杀，因为你...你的心灵受到了攻击，不断重温那些你不想记起的记忆，因为失败而感到内疚。_

_But... You seemed to be like me, running away after feeling humiliated... I ran away just because I was afraid... Not much of a reason, I admit.  
但是...你似乎和我一样，在感到羞辱后选择逃避...我逃跑只是因为我害怕...我承认，这理由并不充分。_

_Afraid... Yeah, Asuka... I'm sorry... I'm simply afraid of dying for I'm such a coward._

Shinji let himself a sigh and carefully held her limp hand. Feeling a bare hint of her heartbeat, he swore that she was sad as he was.  
真嗣叹了口气，小心翼翼地握住她无力的手。感受到她微弱的心跳，他发誓她和自己一样悲伤。

_God, Asuka... I really envy you... I wish I had the same courage and strength you have so that I can fight just like you... But now... why are you so scared... like me?  
天啊，明日香...我真的羡慕你...我多么希望自己也能拥有你那样的勇气和力量，像你一样去战斗...但现在...为什么你如此害怕...像我一样？_

Shinji realized that they may have shared something in common for a few reasons.  
真嗣意识到，他们之间或许有几处共同点。

_Are we cowards in different ways?  
我们是以不同的方式懦弱吗？_

_Tell me, are you afraid? Trying to hide...? Yeah, I wanted to run away and hide... I'm so helpless... I want to get out of this place and forget it...  
告诉我，你害怕吗？试图躲藏...？是的，我想逃跑和躲藏...我如此无助...我想离开这个地方，忘记这一切..._

_But I can't... I can't get out because I... I have nowhere else to go.  
但我不能...我无法离开，因为我...我没有别的地方可去。_

Again, Shinji sighed, before he tightened his grip on her hand even.  
再次，真嗣叹了口气，然后他更紧地握住了她的手。

_I think that you may be the only one... that could understand why I'm like this... I wish I could understand you more... and why you hate me.  
我想，你可能是最能理解我为何如此的人...我多希望能更了解你...以及你为何恨我。_

_Please, can't you tell me right now why you hate me to death, so that I can understand who you really are?  
求你了，你现在能不能告诉我，你为什么这么恨我，好让我明白你到底是谁？_

For a while, Shinji tried to remember about the one time. the only time they kissed. The unforgettable image of that moment flashed in his mind's eye.  
有那么一会儿，真嗣试图回忆起那唯一一次，他们接吻的那一次。那个难忘的瞬间在他脑海中闪现。

It was a kiss not out of true love, but from a bored young woman's whim. Or perhaps it was expected from a Western-bred teenage girl: liberated, extroverted, daring and fiery. The kind of girl which the elders say she's a "Yankee": Japanese slang for rebellious teenagers.  
那不是出于真爱的吻，而是一个无聊少女的一时兴起。又或许，这是西方教养下的少女所期待的：解放、外向、大胆而热情。那种长辈们所说的“不良少女”：日语中的“Yankee”，指的是叛逆的青少年。

As he pursed his lips in contemplation, Shinji could remember how soft her lips were, the taste of her mouth so... different. Her kiss was a strange new sensation to him, yet Asuka quickly yanked him away from her lips, turned off by the way he kissed. That wasn't a real good kiss, for he was doing it as if trying to imitate what he watched on primetime TV.  
当他抿着嘴唇沉思时，真嗣能记得她的唇是多么柔软，她口中的味道如此...不同。她的吻对他来说是一种奇怪的新感觉，然而明日香很快就把他从她的唇边拉开，对他的吻法感到反感。那不是一个真正好的吻，因为他做起来就像是在模仿他在黄金时段电视上看到的那样。

_"Errr! Yeech! I shouldn't have done this just to kill time!" she angrily exclaimed while she spat hard at the floor.  
“呃！噫！我不该为了打发时间就做这种事！”她生气地喊道，同时用力朝地板吐了一口。_

Shinji shook his head, wondering why he felt so nervous to kiss her.  
真嗣摇了摇头，不明白自己为什么在吻她时感到如此紧张。

_My fault, Asuka... I'm a little afraid of kissing you. I... I wished that I wasn't so nervous to do it just for you... I feel that you could have slapped me if I took a wrong step...  
我的错，明日香...我有点害怕吻你。我...我希望自己不会因为只为你而如此紧张...我担心如果我走错一步，你会扇我一巴掌..._

_I need to make that up for you.  
我需要为你弥补这一点。_

Shinji managed a sad smile before he sighed, wanting to see her wake up and then talk it over with her.  
真嗣勉强挤出一个悲伤的微笑，叹了口气，希望能看到她醒来，然后和她好好谈谈。

_Asuka... Give me a second chance... please... I want you back... I need you. That's what I pray for...  
明日香... 再给我一次机会... 求你了... 我想你回来... 我需要你。这就是我祈祷的..._

He turned back to glance at his other companions waiting outside, while Agent Kanzaki gestured to him that he had only two minutes left.  
他回头瞥了一眼在外面等候的其他同伴，而神崎警官示意他只剩下两分钟了。

_I... I still have a couple of minutes for us_, Shinji told her in his thoughts_._  
我... 我们还有几分钟时间，真嗣在心中告诉她_。_

_Anyway, I've just met a new Pilot yesterday and he's now my great friend. His name's Kaworu Nagisa. He just came in here, and... Asuka, he's going to take your place while you're recuperating.  
总之，我昨天刚认识了一位新驾驶员，他现在成了我的好朋友。他叫渚薰。他刚来到这里，而且……明日香，你休养期间他会接替你的位置。_

_Now... don't get angry at me, Asuka_, he reassured, hoping she would not get offended. _Kaworu will take good care of Unit-02 for you. I saw the way he handled it earlier..._  
现在……别生我的气，明日香，他安慰道，希望她不会感到冒犯。渚会好好照顾二号机的。我之前看到他操作的方式……

Shinji looked upon her pallid face, trying to find a hint of human warmth beneath that mask of sadness and despair. He stood up, and in a gesture of sympathy, fondly stroked her hand, letting his fingers caress her skin as he continued his contemplation.  
真嗣凝视着她苍白的脸庞，试图在那层悲伤与绝望的面具下找到一丝人性的温暖。他站起身，带着同情之意温柔地抚摸她的手，让手指轻抚她的肌肤，继续沉思。

_Asuka... I hope that you wake up anytime, so that we can really talk it over... I'll be waiting for you... I promise... I'll be waiting.  
明日香...我希望你能随时醒来，这样我们就能真正谈一谈...我会等你...我保证...我会一直等。_

As if on cue, Agent Kanzaki lightly knocked on the window, getting Shinji's attention. Kanzaki gestured the boy that his time was up.  
仿佛是按了开关，神崎一轻轻敲了敲窗户，吸引了真嗣的注意。神崎示意男孩他的时间到了。

_Well, I've got to go now..._ Shinji smiled softly, as he briefly tapped Asuka's hand gently and stood up. _Thank you... and I'll see you again soon._  
好吧，我现在得走了...真嗣温柔地笑了笑，轻轻地短暂地拍了拍明日香的手，然后站起身来。谢谢你...我们很快会再见面的。

Shinji gave Asuka a last glance, trying to remember the days when her presence had greatly influenced his life, before he finally walked out and gently closed the door behind him.  
真嗣最后瞥了一眼明日香，试图回忆起她曾极大地影响他生活的那些日子，然后他终于走了出去，轻轻地关上了身后的门。

---

Once he was back in their company, Misato and Kaworu stared at Shinji, expecting a reaction from him.  
当他回到他们身边时，美里和薰盯着真嗣，期待着他的反应。

"How did it go, boy? Feel better?" Misato questioned.  
“怎么样，小子？感觉好些了吗？”美里问道。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah... I wished it was a little longer."  
真嗣点点头。“是啊……我希望它能再长一点。”

"Okay," Misato agreed, before she turned to Agent Kanzaki. "Thanks for letting us visit her," she remarked.  
“好的，”美里同意道，然后转向神崎警官。“谢谢你让我们来看她，”她感谢道。

Agent Kanzaki gave her an informal salute. "My pleasure, Major," he beamed before he cocked his sunglasses again.  
神崎警官向她随意地敬了个礼。“乐意之至，美里少校，”他笑着说，然后再次戴上了太阳镜。

"Now let's grab some lunch," Misato informed as she looked down to her watch, which told her it was a half-hour after eleven.  
"现在我们去吃午饭吧，"美里看了一眼手表，告诉他们已经十一点半了。

But before they could leave, they heard Toji Suzuhara call out their names.  
但就在他们准备离开之前，听到了铃原东治叫他们的名字。

"Hey! Shinji! Wait up!" he spoke out loud, as he quickly hobbled up to them.  
"嘿！真嗣！等等我！"他大声喊着，迅速一瘸一拐地向他们走来。

The normally muscle bound Osakan now looked almost gaunt in his Fila sports jacket and pants, after weeks of recuperation, physical therapy and eventual discharge from the Infirmary following his near-fatal mishap. His right arm was still a bandage-and-gauze-covered stump, but his right leg was now an artificial limb.  
原本肌肉发达的大阪人现在穿着 Fila 运动夹克和裤子，显得有些憔悴，经过数周的康复、物理治疗以及从几乎致命的事故中恢复后终于出院。他的右臂仍是一团绷带和纱布包裹的残肢，但右腿现在已换成了一条假肢。

Shinji blinked and swallowed hard. "Oh... Toji! W... What's up?" he nervously asked. "I... I thought you left for the evacuation camp."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，艰难地咽了口唾沫。"哦……东治！你……你还好吗？"他紧张地问道。"我……我还以为你去撤离营地了。"

Toji shrugged. "Nah. I'm back here just for my regular checkup," he informed. "My leg's okay now and the doctors here say that I'll have a new artificial arm by next week." The boy paused for a second, before he continued. "Look, buddy. I want to say something to you."  
东治耸了耸肩。"没有。我只是回来做定期检查，"他解释道。"我的腿现在没事了，这里的医生说下周我就能装上新的假肢了。"男孩顿了一下，然后继续说道。"听着，伙计。我有话想对你说。"

Still nervous, Shinji shot panicky glances around him, before he managed to answer. "Y... Yeah, what is it all about?"  
仍然紧张的碇真嗣慌乱地环顾四周，好不容易才回答道：“是……是啊，这到底是怎么回事？”

Toji stepped up to Shinji, but instead of angrily grabbing the lapels of his friend's shirt, he tapped him on the shoulder with his remaining hand. "Hey, don't you worry. I have nothing against you. You're still my friend despite everything that happened."  
东治走上前去，但没有愤怒地抓住朋友的衣领，而是用他剩下的那只手轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀。“嘿，别担心。我对你没有任何意见。尽管发生了这么多事，你依然是我的朋友。”

Shinji was greatly surprised at Toji's lack of hostility towards him. "What?"  
碇真嗣对东治对他缺乏敌意感到非常惊讶。“什么？”

Toji cackled in laughter. "Please, buddy. I don't give a damn about beating you up anymore, even if I have only this," he answered, holding up what was left of his arm to emphasize his point.  
冬二放声大笑。“拜托，伙计。我现在根本不在乎揍不揍你了，哪怕我只剩下这条胳膊，”他举起残缺的手臂强调道。

Shinji thought of his other classmates. "T... Thanks... How are Hikari, your sister and the others?" he doubtfully questioned.  
真嗣想起了他的其他同学。“谢……谢谢……光、你妹妹和其他人还好吗？”他迟疑地问道。

"She and her sisters are pretty okay, and my sister's doing much better now," Toji admitted. "And, oh, just to tell you the truth... They and Kensuke don't hate you either. Fact is, buddy, they're a lot more concerned about you and everyone else here for the last few weeks since Unit Three got trashed."  
“她和她的姐妹们都挺好的，我妹妹现在也好多了，”冬二承认道。“哦，还有，说实话……她们和剑介也不讨厌你。事实上，自从三号机被毁后，他们过去几周更担心的是你和其他人。”

Flattered and blinking hard, Shinji was suddenly speechless. _They're worried about me? They don't hate me? What in the world...?_  
受宠若惊且努力眨眼，真嗣突然间说不出话来。他们在担心我？他们不讨厌我？这到底是怎么回事...？

Toji cocked an eye at him. "Hey... Looks like you're freaked out. Cat got your tongue?" he questioned as he snapped his fingers in front of Shinji's eyes, perplexed at his friend's disbelief, before he laughed.  
剑介斜眼看着他。“嘿...看来你吓坏了。舌头被猫叼走了？”他一边问，一边在真嗣眼前打了个响指，对朋友的难以置信感到困惑，随后笑了起来。

"Oh, I'm sorry," Shinji blurted, snapped back to reality, before he cracked a real smile in relief. "Thanks again... I was afraid that... I thought they would think that..."  
“哦，对不起，”真嗣脱口而出，回过神来，随后露出了一个真正释然的微笑。“再次感谢...我之前还担心...我以为他们会那样认为...”

Toji shook his head. "Don't say anything else," he advised, before his attention was drawn to Kaworu. "Major, who's he?" he asked.  
冬二摇了摇头。“别再说什么了，”他建议道，随后注意力转向了渚薰。“少校，他是谁？”他问道。

Misato swerved her head at Kaworu and introduced him. "He's Kaworu Nagisa," she informed.  
美里转向渚薰并介绍了他。“他是渚薰，”她告知。

"He's also my new friend," Shinji added cordially. Kaworu nodded with a smile.  
“他也是我的新朋友，”真嗣友好地补充道。渚薰微笑着点了点头。

Toji nodded. "Oh... Hey, I'm Toji Suzuhara. Nice to meet you," he said, grinning like a Cheshire Cat.  
冬二点点头。“哦...嘿，我是铃原东治。很高兴见到你。”他笑得像只柴郡猫。

Kaworu felt flattered to meet a new acquaintance. "Thank you, Toji. It's a pleasure to meet you for the first time."  
渚薰感到荣幸能结识新朋友。“谢谢你，东治。初次见面，不胜荣幸。”

"Yeah, it's hard to find good friends in these hairy times," Toji remarked, before he decided to ask another question. "Ah... What are you doing here?"  
“是啊，这种乱糟糟的时候很难找到好朋友，”东治评论道，随后决定再问一个问题。“啊...你在这里做什么？”

"I've been assigned here from Germany since yesterday, to take Asuka's place after she was incapacitated," Kaworu informed.  
"我从昨天起从德国调派到这里，接替因伤无法行动的明日香。" 渚薰告知。

Toji blinked. "So... You're really the new Pilot?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。 "那么... 你真的是新驾驶员？"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, and I am also sorry that I have to be Miss Souryu's replacement."  
渚薰点头。 "是的，我也为不得不取代惣流小姐的位置而感到抱歉。"

Toji glanced up at the ceiling for a second, before he talked again, shaking his head apologetically.  
冬二抬头瞥了一眼天花板，然后再次开口，歉意地摇了摇头。

"Yeah... A poor girl she was..." he trailed off, pausing a second to think. "She's my smart-ass classmate at our school," he added. "And she's also the most popular girl in our class, too... I didn't like her, but seeing Asuka the way she is now, I've changed my mind... I really feel sorry for her."  
“是啊……她是个可怜的女孩……”他话音渐弱，停顿了一下思考。“她是我们学校的聪明捣蛋同学，”他补充道。“而且她也是我们班上最受欢迎的女生……我以前不喜欢她，但看到现在的明日香，我改变了想法……我真的为她感到难过。”

"Toji, let's just hope that she'll make it," Misato optimistically commented. "Right, Shinji?"  
“冬二，我们只能希望她能挺过去，”美里乐观地评论道。“对吧，真嗣？”

Shinji showed her a sad smile. "Yeah... I'm hoping she'll be up soon," he replied, "so that I can talk to her."  
真嗣向她露出了一个悲伤的微笑。“是啊……我希望她能快点醒来，”他回答道，“这样我就可以和她谈谈了。”

Toji grinned. "That's the spirit, buddy!" he loudly noted, before he got hold of Shinji and hugged him hard. "You ought to make peace with the Devil's Daughter!"  
剑介咧嘴一笑。“这才对嘛，兄弟！”他大声说道，随即抓住真嗣，用力拥抱了他。“你得和魔女之女和解！”

"Oooof... Thanks, Toji," Shinji mumbled, wide-eyed and overwhelmed by his friend's big embrace.  
“呃……谢谢你，剑介，”真嗣咕哝着，睁大了眼睛，被朋友的热情拥抱弄得不知所措。

Quite forgiving, Toji let go of him and smirked. "Yep, what are friends are for?" he quipped, before all of them chuckled.  
相当宽容的，冬治放过了他，并露出了得意的笑容。“是啊，朋友不就是干这个的吗？”他打趣道，随后大家都笑了起来。

"Um, Mister Suzuhara," Misato barged in.  
“呃，铃原先生，”美里突然插话道。

"Yeah, Major?" Toji wondered.

"Shinji and I would be taking Pen-Pen to Hikari's place and dropping him off there later this afternoon," Misato informed.  
“真嗣和我稍后会带 Pen-Pen 去光的家，下午把他放在那里，”美里告知。

Toji scowled. "Oh, I live next door, but why?"  
冬二皱起眉头。“哦，我就住在隔壁，但为什么？”

"I need our little buddy to be kept safe there," the older woman explained. "He needs some extra company, since it's possible that the worse could come within this week."  
“我需要我们的小家伙在那里得到保护，”那位年长的女士解释道。“他需要一些额外的陪伴，因为这周可能会有更糟糕的事情发生。”

Toji nodded before he glanced at his watch. "Looks like it's time for lunch," he noted.  
冬二点点头，然后瞥了一眼手表。“看起来是吃午饭的时间了，”他提醒道。

"Wanna join us instead?" Misato asked, hoping that this might be a great opportunity to mend the boys' fences. Shinji and Kaworu nodded in agreement.  
“想加入我们吗？”美里问道，希望这可能是一个修复男孩们关系的好机会。真嗣和薰点头同意。

The jock smiled. "Yes... Well, that's going to be home week," Toji answered. "I'm starving."  
那个运动员笑了。“是的...嗯，那将是回家周，” 冬二回答。“我饿坏了。”

His response elicited laughter before Misato figured that the food there at the Cafeteria would be as good as prison-camp fare.  
他的回答引起了笑声，随后美里认为食堂里的食物可能和战俘营的伙食一样糟糕。

"I think it's bento boxes for now... or whatever," she flatly commented.  
"我想现在应该是便当盒吧... 或者是别的什么，" 她平淡地评论道。

"That's not a problem," Shinji agreed, before they walked towards the elevators.  
"那不是问题，" 真嗣同意道，随后他们走向电梯。

"Yeah, who knows if it's stewed fish heads or squid balls?" Toji chimed in. "But... I forgot to ask to you guys about one thing."  
"是啊，谁知道是炖鱼头还是鱿鱼丸呢？" 东治插话道，"不过... 我忘了问你们一件事。"

Shinji turned to him and cocked an eye. "What?"  
真嗣转向他，挑了挑眉毛。“什么？”

"What are you guys doing this morning? I mean, before both of you came here," Toji asked.  
“你们今天早上在做什么？我是说，在你们俩来这里之前，”东治问道。

"It's Eva combat gunnery practice," Shinji admitted. "Well, Kaworu and I did a two-minute combat simulation exercise," he clarified.  
“是 EVA 战斗炮术训练，”真嗣承认道。“嗯，我和卡罗尔进行了一次两分钟的战斗模拟练习，”他补充说明。

Toji nodded in satisfaction. "I see," he conceded, not really wanting to ask more about their sync ratios and the like.  
冬二满意地点了点头。“我明白了，”他让步道，其实并不想再多问关于他们的同步率之类的事情。

Once aboard the elevator after its doors shut, Shinji decided to ask one more question to Kaworu.  
电梯门关闭后，碇真嗣决定再向渚薰问一个问题。

"Do you really want to talk to Rei?" he quietly mumbled, before they all felt the elevator lurch upward.  
“你真的想和绫波说话吗？”他小声嘀咕着，随后他们都感觉到电梯向上猛地一晃。

Kaworu stared at him. "Yes," he promised as he smiled. "But better to do it later."  
渚薰盯着他。“是的，”他微笑着承诺，“但最好晚点再做。”

"What's the matter with Rei?" Toji curtly asked Kaworu.  
“绫波怎么了？”冬二简短地问渚薰。

Kaworu smiled back. "I'm sorry, but isn't Ayanami your classmate?"  
渚薰回以微笑。“抱歉，但绫波不是你的同学吗？”

Toji nodded. "Yeah, pal. She's the quiet recluse type," he remarked, "Doesn't go along with the other girls in class. She'll just sit there and reads something, like the little book she carries along."  
冬二点点头。“是啊，伙计。她是个安静的隐居者类型，”他评论道，“不和班上的其他女生来往。她只会坐在那里看书，就像她随身携带的那本小书一样。”

"And what else do you know about her?" Kaworu curiously asked.  
“你还知道她什么？”薰好奇地问。

"With the way she acts and talks, Rei is a bit more mature than the rest of us," Toji commented, while Shinji listened to them. "You don't get to see girls of our age doing things that's more apt for grown-ups."  
“从她的举止和谈吐来看，丽比我们其他人都要成熟一些，”冬二评论道，而真嗣在一旁听着。“你很少见到我们这个年纪的女孩做更适合成年人的事情。”

"Is that a problem? Some people really like mature-minded teenagers," Kaworu added.  
"那有问题吗？有些人真的很喜欢思想成熟的青少年，"渚薰补充道。

Toji nodded. "You could be right. The coolest thing or two about Rei is that she doesn't absolutely complain," he spoke. "She'll keep things to herself and do her work as directed. But when you put Rei and Asuka in one place... That's when the fireworks start."  
真嗣点头。"你说得对。丽最酷的一两点在于她从不绝对抱怨，"他说道。"她会把事情藏在心里，按照指示完成工作。但当你把丽和明日香放在一起时...那就是烟花的开始。"

Kaworu blinked. "Why? Do they disagree or they get into a fight?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。"为什么？她们是意见不合还是打起来了？

Toji scowled on the fight part. "For example, the first time they met," he continued, "what Rei told Asuka after that German girl introduced herself and offered to be her friend, was that she'll do it if the Commander orders her to do so. It may look funny, but... that's how I think about Rei. She's duty-bound and loyal to a fault. You got me?"  
冬二对战斗部分皱起了眉头。“比如说，他们第一次见面时，”他继续说道，“那个德国女孩自我介绍并提出要和她做朋友后，丽对明日香说的话是，如果司令命令她这么做，她就会去做。这可能看起来很可笑，但...这就是我对丽的看法。她责任心强，忠诚得过分。你明白我的意思吗？”

Kaworu nodded, adding those bits of pertinent information for his use later. "Yes, now I understand why," he agreed.  
薰点头，将这些相关信息记下以备后用。“是的，现在我明白了为什么，”他同意道。

"Have you ever known Rei was having problems with her memory?" Shinji suddenly asked his friend.  
“你有没有听说过丽在记忆方面有问题？”真嗣突然问他的朋友。

Toji was taken by surprise. "What? She can't remember? How did that happen?"  
冬二感到意外。“什么？她记不得了？这是怎么发生的？”

Kaworu sighed. "Rei was said to have lost her memory after taking out the Sixteenth Angel. That's what Misato told me when I came here," he admitted.  
渚薰叹了口气。“据说丽在击退第十六使徒后失去了记忆。这是美里在我来这里时告诉我的，”他承认道。

"Like telling Rei about what happened before, just to make her remember again?' Shinji suggested. "That could work."  
“就像告诉丽之前发生的事情，只是为了让她再次记起？”真嗣提议道。“那可能行得通。”

"We'll try that and see," Kaworu answered. _But if that doesn't work out well,_ he thought, _I may have to find another way._  
“我们会试试看，”渚薰回答。但如果这方法行不通，他想，我可能得另寻他法。

In the one of the other elevators, NERV Supreme Commander Gendo Ikari was now thinking of the specialized surgery he had scheduled for this evening.  
在另一部电梯里，NERV 最高指挥官碇源堂此刻正想着今晚安排的特殊手术。

_Doctor Odani is the right woman to do the job,_ he decided, after reading several dossiers about the Infirmary's medical specialists that were given to him by the Human Resources Department.  
在阅读了人力资源部提供的关于医务室医疗专家的几份档案后，他认定，小谷医生是这项工作的合适人选。

Out of this assemblage, Gendo selected Doctor Natsumi Odani on the basis of her qualifications as a general practice doctor, a pediatrician and a surgeon, with her educational background hailing from New Harvard Medical School and Tokyo-2 University's College of Medicine.  
在这群人中，源堂选中了医生音美纳都美，基于她作为全科医生、儿科医生和外科医生的资质，她的教育背景来自新哈佛医学院和东京-2 大学的医学院。

Gendo then recalled the circumstances when he summoned the 27-year-old woman in his office two days ago.  
源堂随后回忆起两天前他召见这位 27 岁女子到他办公室的情形。

After Natsumi had sworn an oath that she would never mention the proceedings of their conversation and signed a high-security non-disclosure agreement, Gendo outlined to Natsumi on what will be done to his left hand tonight.  
在音美发誓绝不提及他们对话的内容并签署了一份高安全级别的保密协议后，源堂向音美详细说明了今晚将对他左手进行的操作。

It was the matter of grafting Adam into the palm of his hand, where Gendo would keep it until the awaited day, hidden beneath the white gloves he worn whenever he ventured out of the world. Being pleased with the woman's planned method of surgical grafting, Odani's security clearance was immediately upgraded to a level close to Dr. Akagi's, as a sign of his approval.  
这是关于将亚当嫁接到他手掌中的事情，任由碇源堂将其保留至期待之日，隐藏在他外出时所戴的白手套之下。对这位女士计划的手术移植方法感到满意，碇源堂立即将片名的安全权限提升至接近赤木律子博士的水平，以此作为他的认可标志。

As Gendo felt the elevator lurch to a halt and the doors opened, it revealed Rei Ayanami, who was waiting for his elevator to arrive.  
当碇源堂感觉到电梯突然停下，门打开时，映入眼帘的是绫波零，她正等待着他的电梯到来。

"It's good to see you, Rei," Gendo greeted, his eyes blinking behind the shaded glasses.  
“见到你真好，绫波，”碇源堂问候道，他的眼睛在墨镜后眨了眨。

"Good morning, Commander," Rei answered with a nod as she walked into the elevator before the armored steel doors closed.  
"早上好，指挥官。" 丽一边点头回应，一边走进电梯，随后装甲钢门缓缓关闭。

"Where are you going now?" the older man asked.  
"你现在去哪儿？" 年长的男子问道。

"I am going to the Cafeteria for lunch, before I take a swim, sir," Rei explained briefly as she pressed a button for the floor level where the Cafeteria was.  
"我要去食堂吃午饭，然后去游泳，长官。" 丽简短地解释着，同时按下了通往食堂楼层的按钮。

"I see," Gendo agreed. "I have to eat lunch later since there are very important matters that personally need my attention. As for your swimming time, that will be acceptable."  
"我明白了，" 碇源堂同意道。"我稍后需要用餐，因为有非常重大的事务需要我亲自处理。至于你的游泳时间，那将是可以接受的。"

Rei gently nodded, concurring with the Commander's reasons and his approval.  
绫波零轻轻点头，赞同司令的理由及其批准。

"There are reports coming from the Intelligence Section and the Government Liaison Department," Gendo mentioned.  
"情报部门和政府联络部有报告传来，" 碇源堂提及道。

"I understand, sir," Rei agreed.  
"我明白了，先生，" 丽同意道。

"Regarding the government," he explained, "the Diet... the Parliament has approved new legislation concerning the massive equipment and weaponry movements of the infantry and armored divisions of the Self-Defense Force, which could be an ominous sign..."  
"关于政府，" 他解释说，"国会...议会已经通过了关于自卫队步兵和装甲师大规模装备与武器调动的新法案，这可能是一个不祥的征兆..."

Gendo made a very short pause. _The impatient old men,_ he muttered sarcastically in his thoughts.  
源堂短暂地停顿了一下。那些不耐烦的老家伙，他在心里讽刺地嘀咕着。

"And as for the Committee itself," he added, "it is imperative that we must be ahead of them in the implementation of the Plan. Time is of utmost importance, young woman."  
"至于委员会本身，"他补充道，"我们必须抢在他们之前实施计划。时间至关重要，年轻人。"

Rei kept her silence, as she listened.  
丽静静地听着，一言不发。

"Concerning the Plan, there is a valuable lesson about the worth of trust, Rei," Gendo spoke.  
"关于计划，丽，关于信任的价值，有一个重要的教训，"源渡说道。"

"If the capacity of trust is given to a certain person, and complete trust between persons under the cloak of secrecy is to be discussed, then I have to tell you something about Doctor Akagi." Gendo said, with his mouth curved slightly into a frown, a sign of his loathing towards the imprisoned woman.  
“如果将信任赋予某个人，并在保密的外衣下探讨人与人之间的完全信任，那么我必须告诉你一些关于赤木律子博士的事情。”源渡说道，嘴角微微皱起，显露出他对那位被囚禁女性的厌恶。

"What is it about the Doctor, Commander?" Rei questioned as she eyed the level indicator.  
“指挥官，关于赤木博士有什么问题吗？”绫波零问道，同时注视着液位指示器。

"She is not to be trusted, Rei, because she has compromised the Plan, in part to advance the aims of the Committee ahead of us. Do you understand that?" Gendo emphasized, before he waited for Rei to confirm.  
“她不可信，绫波，因为她损害了计划，部分是为了让委员会的目标赶在我们之前。你明白吗？”源渡强调道，随后等待绫波确认。

"Yes, Commander," Rei agreed without emotion.  
“是的，指挥官，”绫波毫无感情地同意道。

"Good," Gendo accepted. "Trust is, I believe, is a very precious commodity that we must be aware of and must be given carefully. And there is one more thing, Rei."  
“很好，”碇源堂接受了。“我相信，信任是一种非常宝贵的资源，我们必须意识到并谨慎给予。还有一件事，绫波。”

"Yes sir?"

Gendo turned to Rei. "Have you met the Fifth Children again this morning?" he asked formally.  
碇源堂转向绫波。“今天早上你又见到第五适格者了吗？”他正式地问道。

Rei nodded softly. "Yes sir. I have seen him and Shinji in their combat exercises at the Training Center," she informed, not mentioning the rather embarrassing collision between her and Kaworu.  
丽轻轻点头。“是的，先生。我在训练中心见过他和真嗣进行战斗训练，”她报告道，并未提及自己与薰之间那次颇为尴尬的碰撞。

"From your observations regarding their training exercises, how well do you assess the fighting capabilities of the Fifth Children?" Gendo now questioned her like a teacher, interested to know precisely what Kaworu was made of in that aspect.  
“根据你对他们训练的观察，你如何评价第五适格者的战斗能力？”源渡现在像一位老师一样询问她，想要确切了解薰在这方面的实力。

"He is very good. He emphasizes teamwork in battle and he knows what he is expected in a dangerous situation, sir," Rei answered without hesitation.  
“他非常出色。他强调战斗中的团队合作，并且清楚自己在危险情况下的职责，先生，”丽毫不犹豫地回答。

Gendo nodded to her in agreement with a small smile. "It is an excellent study, young woman," he praised. "The Fifth is what I expect from a Pilot in professionalism, instead of the useless Second Children he has replaced. Now, have you ever talked to him?"  
源渡向她点头表示同意，嘴角带着一丝微笑。“这是一项出色的研究，年轻女士，”他称赞道。“第五适任者展现了我期望的专业素养，而非他取代的无用第二适任者。那么，你曾与他交谈过吗？”

"I apologize for not having that opportunity yet, Commander," Rei admitted.  
“很抱歉，我尚未有此机会，指挥官，”绫波承认道。

The bearded Commander adjusted his glasses. "That will not be a problem," he replied. "Instead, try to have more contact with the Fifth Children and socialize with him, so that we may know who really he is, because he is from the Committee."  
留着胡须的指挥官调整了一下眼镜。“那不会成为问题，”他回答道。“相反，尝试与第五适任者增加接触并与之社交，以便我们能了解他的真实面目，因为他来自委员会。”

"Yes, Commander," she finally agreed after giving some thought about the order. "I understand."  
"是的，指挥官，"她经过一番思考后终于同意了这个命令。"我明白了。"

At once, with a ding and the elevator coming to a halt, the thick steel doors opened and Rei walked out, until she turned her attention back to the Commander.  
立刻，随着一声叮响，电梯停了下来，厚重的钢门打开，丽走了出去，直到她再次将注意力转向指挥官。

"Thank you, Commander," Rei concluded. Gendo answered the girl back with a nod before the elevator doors closed shut.  
"谢谢您，指挥官，"丽总结道。碇司令向女孩点了点头，随后电梯门缓缓关闭。

Once she was left alone in the brightly-lit corridor, Rei glanced at the digital clock on the wall facing the bank of elevators, as other uniformed personnel passed by and chatting while they strolled, carrying their folders or briefcases.  
当独自一人留在灯火通明的走廊时，丽瞥了一眼电梯对面墙上显示时间的数字钟，身着制服的工作人员们或拿着文件夹或提着公文包，边走边聊。

_I must eat now,_ Rei reflected as she paced away from the elevators, heading for the Headquarters' Cafeteria.  
我得去吃点东西了，丽一边想着，一边离开电梯，朝总部食堂走去。

### Chapter 7 Over Lunch

At noon the cafeteria was packed with NERV personnel, eating and talking. In the smoking section some were having a few puffs of their cigarettes while the filters above the smokers' heads hummed, taking away the noxious fumes from the air.  
正午时分，NERV 的食堂挤满了用餐和交谈的人员。在吸烟区，一些人正抽着烟，头顶的过滤器嗡嗡作响，将有害烟雾从空气中吸走。

There was laughter for every joke cracked, and there was some murmuring in other groups, discussing the problems of fixing the faulty condenser units or the upcoming results of the next batch of chemical compounds. The diners also talked about going home after their tour of duty, longing for their families. The fun-lovers would have loved to hit the invigorating hot springs and slug down the ice-cold beer at the nearby towns of Gora and Owakutani down in the Valley for the weekend, while a few lowly clerks complained about their pesky department supervisor and those nag jobs.  
每个笑话都引来了笑声，其他小组则在低声讨论修复故障冷凝器的问题或下一批化学化合物的预期结果。用餐者们还谈到了下班后回家的渴望，思念着家人。爱玩的人本想在周末去附近的 Gora 和 Owakutani 小镇泡温泉，畅饮冰镇啤酒，而一些低级职员则在抱怨他们那烦人的部门主管和那些烦人的工作。

However, they paid little attention to the three Children and their commanding officer as they carried their trays of lunch from the counter, heading for the nearest empty table, where they sat.  
然而，他们几乎没有注意到那三位少年和他们指挥官，他们端着午餐托盘从柜台走向最近的空桌，坐了下来。

While Misato was content with her bowl of richly-spiced beef ramen, Toji nodded in delight, having a tray of freshly-cut tuna and steaming rice right in front of him.  
尽管美里对自己那碗香浓的牛肉拉面感到满意，真嗣却开心地点头，面前摆着一盘新鲜切片的金枪鱼和热腾腾的米饭。

"Not bad, yeah, not bad," he remarked as he prepared his chopsticks. "I thought it'd be terrible, but this is top-class chow!"  
“不错，确实不错，”他一边准备筷子一边评论道，“我以为会很糟糕，但这简直是顶级美食！”

"At least, we get better lunches than anywhere else in this country," Shinji said as he ate some braised beef.  
“至少，我们这里的午餐比国内其他地方都好，”真嗣一边吃着炖牛肉一边说。

Toji grinned. "Well, I'll try this dish for myself. You know that lunchtime is my favorite subject."  
冬二咧嘴一笑。“好吧，我自己来尝尝这道菜。你知道的，午餐时间可是我最喜欢的科目。”

Kaworu chuckled, while the simmer from his steamed vegetables in the bento wafted. "That's correct," he agreed. "We spend 90% of our time in school feeding our minds before we dole out the remaining time for our hunger."  
渚薰轻笑，他便当里的蒸蔬菜香气四溢。“没错，”他赞同道，“我们在学校里 90%的时间都在充实头脑，然后才把剩下的时间用来填饱肚子。”

Toji shook his head. "On second thought, Kaworu," he spoke, "How do you feel if you faced a teacher who does nothing but talk about his past all day long? It's boring as hell, right?"  
冬二摇了摇头。“再想想，渚薰，”他说，“如果你面对一个整天只谈论自己过去的老师，你会怎么想？那可真是无聊透顶，对吧？”

Kaworu nodded. "Nothing is gained from pointless repetition," he remarked.  
渚薰点头。“无谓的重复毫无益处，”他评论道。

"Unless you sneak out of the classroom and break the fire alarm," Toji added, before he laughed. "And then you hit two birds with just one stone. No Second Impact stories and no classes either! Now that's a good day-off!"  
“除非你偷偷溜出教室并触发火警，”真嗣补充道，随即笑了起来。“这样你就能一石二鸟。既没有第二次冲击的故事，也不用上课！那才叫一个好假！”

"Hmmm," Kaworu interjected. "Tell me, what are your lifestyles back at school? It sounds very interesting."  
“嗯，”渚薰插话道。“告诉我，你们在学校的生活方式是怎样的？听起来很有趣。”

"As I've said," Toji explained, "We spend most of the time hearing our teacher tell us to death that his hometown is a huge aquarium centerpiece, and that's not fun. And then there are those Angel attacks where everyone scrambles for the nearest bomb shelter, so we call that pretty typical. In our school, there's no junior high school experience like that elsewhere in Japan, except maybe for the lunch they serve at the school cafeteria."  
"正如我所说，" 冬二解释道，"我们大部分时间都在听老师唠叨他的家乡是个巨大的水族馆中心，这可不好玩。然后还有那些使徒袭击，大家争先恐后地往最近的防空洞跑，我们觉得这挺典型的。在我们学校，没有像日本其他地方那样的初中生活，除了学校食堂提供的午餐。"

"I see," Kaworu remarked. "You also have some other classmates... or friends?"  
"我明白了，" 渚薰评论道。"你们还有一些其他同学...或者朋友？"

"Yeah," Shinji said. "Besides Hikari, whom you already know as our Class Rep, Kensuke is our resident geek. He's more into exciting military stuff than math."  
"是的，" 真嗣说。"除了你已经认识的我们班班长光，还有我们的军事迷健介。他对刺激的军事事物比对数学更感兴趣。"

While eating as the boys kept on chatting, Misato hoped that her trusted aide had some more news for her to digest, perhaps more likely the details regarding Nagisa and the activities of the Committee.  
当男孩们继续聊天时，美里一边吃着，一边希望她信任的助手能带来更多消息供她消化，更有可能是关于渚和委员会活动的细节。

_I'm sure that Hyuga is doing everything he can to find the truth about this... this ongoing conspiracy,_ Misato contemplated. _And I can't discount the fact that it might be possible that Kaworu is a part of the game the Committee is playing with the Commander–_  
我确信日向正在尽其所能揭开这个……这个持续阴谋的真相，美里思索着。我不能忽视这样一个事实，即真嗣可能也是委员会与指挥官博弈的一部分——

Misato suddenly frowned, wondering why she would mention Commander Ikari, before she realized that from her previous observations she could conclude that the enigmatic Commander was a man with a single-minded plan, but what plan? And if the plan is actually the Human Instrumentality Project, then what is it really about?  
美里突然皱起眉头，不明白自己为何会提到碇指挥官，随后她意识到，根据之前的观察，她可以断定这位神秘的指挥官是一个有着坚定计划的人，但那是什么计划？如果这个计划实际上是人类补完计划，那么它究竟意味着什么？

_Fifteen years and still I have yet to know what the hell's really going on... Ryoji... what could be this game's final score?  
十五年了，我仍然不知道到底发生了什么... 怜司...这场游戏的最终得分会是什么？_

Misato sighed, before she glanced at the talking gray-haired boy near her seat. _It seems that Kaworu really turned Shinji around... I mean, the kid is acting almost normal..._  
美里叹了口气，然后瞥了一眼坐在她旁边正在说话的灰发男孩。看来渚薰真的改变了真嗣...我是说，这孩子现在表现得几乎正常了...

_At least,_ Misato mused as she heard the boys talking about another of their anecdotes, _they're now trying to mend their broken bridges-_  
至少，美里一边听着男孩们谈论着他们的另一个轶事，一边思索着，他们现在正试图修复他们破碎的桥梁——

"Major?" a girl's voice spoke from behind.  
"少校？" 一个女孩的声音从背后传来。

"What?" Misato cried, almost knocking off her bowl in surprise.  
"什么？" 美里惊叫道，差点把碗打翻了。

She turned around to see that Rei was standing there. Blinking softly, the girl was holding her tray, loaded with a bento ensemble of vegetable salad and rice, plus a cup of green tea.  
她转过身，看到丽站在那里。女孩轻轻眨眼，手里端着托盘，上面摆满了蔬菜沙拉和米饭的便当，还有一杯绿茶。

"Rei..." she mumbled, trying to get over her shock, while the two "normal" boys gaped at the girl's unexpected arrival. "Please, don't try to sneak on me like that again, okay?"  
"丽..." 她喃喃道，试图从震惊中恢复过来，而那两个"普通"男孩则目瞪口呆地看着女孩的意外出现。"请不要再那样偷偷摸摸地接近我了，好吗？"

"I am sorry, Major Katsuragi," Rei apologized. "I did not mean to surprise you..."  
"对不起，葛城少校，" 丽道歉道。"我不是有意要吓到你..."

Misato sighed before she smiled. "Never mind about it, young lady. Come on, why don't you join us instead?"  
美里叹了口气，随即微笑道：“别在意了，小姑娘。来吧，不如加入我们？”

Rei peered at Kaworu for a second, before she took a seat facing him, and put down her tray on the table. The girl replied with a nod while preparing her chopsticks.  
绫波盯着渚薰看了一会儿，然后在他对面坐下，将餐盘放在桌上。她点了点头，准备拿起筷子。

In his mind, Shinji had a sudden urge to ask so many questions, wishing to talk, to apologize for whatever errors he made against her, or explain why she was a product of the Dummy Plug Plant.  
在真嗣心中，他突然涌起一股强烈的冲动，想要问许多问题，渴望交谈，为他对她犯下的任何错误道歉，或是解释为什么她是由 Dummy Plug 工厂制造出来的。

"R... Ayanami..." he stuttered, choosing the right name to use.  
"绫... 绫波..." 他结结巴巴地选择着合适的称呼。

"Yes?" the blue-haired girl answered.  
"什么事？" 蓝发女孩回应道。

"I... I... just want to..." Shinji spoke, awkwardly trying to compose his thoughts into words, but he realized that this wasn't the right time and place to talk. "Sorry," he finally decided, shaking his head apologetically. "It's nothing... maybe later."  
"我... 我... 只是想..." 真嗣尴尬地试图将自己的想法组织成语言，但他意识到这不是谈话的合适时间和地点。"对不起，" 他最终决定，抱歉地摇了摇头。"没什么... 也许以后再说。"

Rei nodded gently before she took the first bite of cabbage laced with dressing.  
绫轻轻点头，随即咬下了第一口拌有调料的卷心菜。

"I thought you'd eat lunch on your own," Kaworu noted.  
“我以为你会自己吃午饭。”渚指出。

Rei softly shook her head. "That is true, but I now feel that I prefer having lunch with other people."  
绫轻轻摇头。“确实如此，但我现在觉得，我更喜欢和别人一起吃午饭。”

Her lunch-time companions nodded in agreement.  
她的午餐伙伴们点头表示同意。

"Now that's a welcome change," Misato commented. "Where have you been after they finished the combat exercises in the Simulator? You left us too soon."  
“现在这是个受欢迎的变化，”美里评论道，“他们在模拟器里完成战斗训练后你去哪儿了？你离开得太快了。”

"I went to the Library and I looked for information," Rei simply replied. "I apologize for my absence."  
“我去了图书馆查找资料，”绫波简单地回答，“对于我的缺席，我表示歉意。”

Shinji blinked while his companions listened. "What information?' he inquired softly.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，他的同伴们则在一旁倾听。“什么信息？”他轻声询问道。

"I am sorry... I cannot discuss it," Rei answered, not wanting to tell them that she sought for articles about amnesia.  
“对不起……我不能讨论这个，”绫波回答，不想告诉他们她在寻找关于失忆的文章。

"Hey... Ayanami," Toji spoke brightly. "It's nice to see you again, so how are you anyway?"  
“嘿……绫波，”东治语气明快地说道，“很高兴再次见到你，话说你最近怎么样？”

"I am fine," the girl replied simply.  
"我很好，" 女孩简单地回答道。

"Sure, you're fine in my eyes," Toji remarked, "I just got a check-up with the doctors down at the Infirmary... Met our buddies and I found out that you can't remember anything. Is that true?" he questioned before taking another bite.  
"当然，在我眼里你很好，" 冬二说道，"我刚去医务室做了检查...遇到了我们的伙伴，发现你什么都不记得了。这是真的吗？" 他咬了一口食物，继续问道。

Blinking softly, it took some time for Rei to think as eyes and ears were upon her, waiting for the girl's answer.  
轻轻眨眼，丽需要一些时间思考，因为众人的目光和期待都集中在她身上，等待着她的回答。

"Yes," Rei confirmed sadly. "I cannot remember what happened to me before the sortie, though I can remember people's faces and names."  
“是的，”丽悲伤地确认道，“我记不起出击前发生的事了，虽然我能记得人们的脸和名字。”

Toji gaped in mixed wonder and disappointment. "Oh," he blurted out.  
剑介目瞪口呆，既惊讶又失望。“哦，”他脱口而出。

The burly Osakan turned to Shinji and the other young man nodded quietly. For a moment Toji felt considerable pity for this girl as he ate, trying to use his food to squelch his sadness.  
魁梧的大阪人转向真嗣，另一个年轻人静静地点了点头。有那么一会儿，剑介在吃饭时感到对这个女孩相当同情，试图用食物来压抑自己的悲伤。

_What I remember about you, Ayanami... the first time you stepped into our classroom, none of us gave a flying fig. Now you looked as if you've finally lost everything... but I feel that somebody has to help you out before it's too late. However, even if you're acting that way this time... you're still my classmate.  
关于你的记忆，绫波...你第一次走进我们教室时，我们谁也没放在心上。现在你看起来像是终于失去了所有...但我觉得在为时已晚之前，总得有人帮你一把。不过，即使这次你表现得如此...你依然是我的同学。_

"I'm sorry for what happened to you," Toji remarked with a sad smile. "In case you want to know, we're also worried about you and the rest of the gang, wondering if you're okay after what happened to me." Once more he showed to Rei what remained of his arm to emphasize his point. For the rest of Toji's life, the amputation was his red badge of courage.  
“对于发生在你身上的事，我很抱歉，”冬二带着悲伤的微笑说道，“如果你想知道，我们也很担心你和其他人，想知道在我出事后你们是否安好。”他再次向绫波展示他残缺的手臂，以强调他的观点。对冬二来说，截肢成了他勇气的红色徽章。

The girl nodded gently in response. "T... Thank you for your concern."  
女孩轻轻点头回应。“谢...谢谢你的关心。”

Toji smiled back. "Well, that's my by-line. I also owe you a good one," he answered and returned to consume more of his lunch.  
冬二回以微笑。“嗯，那是我的风格。我还欠你一个好故事呢，”他答道，随即继续享用他的午餐。

Except for the words she answered, Rei sank into her thoughts as she resumed eating. _Saying "thank you" means gratitude,_ the girl reflected, _those words for the first time. I have never even said them before._  
除了回答的话语，零继续吃着，陷入了沉思。说“谢谢”意味着感激，女孩反思着，这是她第一次真正说出这些话。我以前从未说过。

"Ayanami," Shinji said quietly, putting down his chopsticks.  
“绫波，”真嗣轻声说道，放下了筷子。

Snapped out of her thoughts, the cobalt-haired girl slowly turned to face him. "Pardon me?"  
从思绪中回过神来，蓝发女孩缓缓转身面对他。“你说什么？”

"I... I was thinking about whether you ever took the time to visit Asuka..." the Third Children asked, sobriety in his voice.  
“我……我在想你是否曾抽空去看望明日香……”第三适格者问道，语气中带着严肃。

Rei shook her head. "N... No, I have not done that yet. I should also apologize for this, but I was informed that she will be returned home."  
绫波摇了摇头。“不……没有，我还没有去过。我也应该为此道歉，但我被告知她将会回家。”

Shinji looked at her with disappointed eyes. "I know," he groaned.  
真嗣用失望的眼神看着她。“我知道，”他呻吟道。

Misato's thoughts flashed back, on the day after Section Two found Asuka in an abandoned village, after the agents combed the Hakone area for the runaway girl.  
美里思绪回溯，想起第二课在废弃村庄找到明日香的那一天，特工们在箱根地区搜寻逃跑的女孩。

_"Section Two reported that they found Asuka alive," Makoto informed as they stood by the railing on the suspension bridge spanning the waters of Hayakawa River. They were alone, this being one of the few places they deemed free from prying eyes.  
“第二课报告说他们找到了活着的明日香，”真琴站在横跨早川河的吊桥栏杆旁说道。他们独自一人，这里被认为是少数没有窥探目光的地方之一。_

_Misato nodded. "I see," she answered. "It's been a bloody week since they started looking for her. That's not the way they operate."  
美里点了点头。“我明白了，”她回答道，“自从他们开始寻找她以来，这一周真是血雨腥风。这不是他们的行事风格。”_

_"It could be that they did it on purpose," Makoto agreed. "It appears that the Planning Division is trying to screw things up."  
“可能是他们故意这么做的，”真琴同意道，“看来策划部是想把事情搞砸。”_

Misato scowled for a second after the recall before she took the chopsticks and continued to eat her lunch.  
美里在回忆后皱了一会儿眉，然后拿起筷子继续吃她的午餐。

However, Misato saw Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki coming their way, easing through the aisles of tables while carrying his own bento pack on a tray. She stood up in attention, to speak on behalf of her charges.  
然而，美里看到副司令官冬月正朝他们走来，穿梭在餐桌间的过道，手里端着自己的便当盒。她立刻起身立正，代表她的学生们发言。

"Good afternoon sir," Misato greeted.  
“下午好，长官，”美里问候道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "At ease, Major," he answered while eyeing the seated Children, who stared back at him. "Good afternoon, Children," he added.  
冬月点了点头。“放松些，少校，”他回答道，同时扫视着坐在那里的孩子们，他们也回望着他。“下午好，孩子们，”他补充道。

"Good afternoon sir," the Children answered back politely all at once.  
"下午好，先生。" 孩子们齐声礼貌地回应道。

Misato smiled after the two officers took their seats. "Thank you sir. I thought you would be eating at your own table."  
两位军官坐下后，美里微笑着说："谢谢您，先生。我以为您会在自己的桌子上用餐。"

"A slight change in my eating habits, Major," Fuyutsuki responded, while preparing his chopsticks. "I believe that dining with junior officers and enlisted personnel would do well for organizational morale and efficiency, so I can listen to their problems and see if I can come up with any solutions."  
"我的饮食习惯稍有改变，少校，" 冬月回答道，同时准备着筷子。"我认为与下级军官和士兵共餐有利于提升组织士气和效率，这样我可以倾听他们的问题，看看能否提出解决方案。"

Misato nodded in agreement. "That's a very good idea, sir."  
美里点头表示同意。"那是个非常好的主意，长官。"

"So," Fuyutsuki continued after eating the first bite, "Do you have any plans for this afternoon?"  
"那么，" 冬月在吃完第一口后继续说道，"你今天下午有什么计划吗？"

Misato cleared her throat. "Sir, I'm supposed to file my leave for today, since I'm planning to bring my pet to a friend for safe-keeping and ferry Mister Suzuhara home with Shinji assisting me on the way, and..." she glanced at the two albino Children.  
美里清了清喉咙。"长官，我今天应该提交休假申请，因为我打算把我的宠物送到朋友那里保管，并带着铃原先生回家，由真嗣协助我，还有..." 她瞥了一眼那两位白化病的孩子。

"Where you will be going afterwards?" Misato asked Rei.  
“你之后要去哪儿？”美里问绫波。

"I will go to the Recreation Center and swim there," Rei replied. "The Commander has given me permission to do so. However..."  
“我会去娱乐中心游泳，”绫波回答，“司令已经允许我这么做。但是……”

There was a doubtful pause in Rei's thoughts, as the girl tried to muster her courage to say the words. With several eyes on her, Rei wasn't really sure if she could confide her words to Kaworu Nagisa, for the Commander had lectured earlier about the value of trust.  
绫波的思绪中出现了一丝犹豫，她试图鼓起勇气说出那些话。在众目睽睽之下，绫波并不确定自己能否向渚薰吐露心声，因为司令之前刚刚强调过信任的价值。

_Could I trust him with what I could say?_ Rei pondered. _He is mysterious... I do not know if he could be a good... friend?_  
我能相信他吗？我能对他说些什么？丽思索着。他神秘莫测……我不知道他是否能成为一个好的……朋友？

_Is Kaworu a friend or not?  
薰是朋友吗？_

_He seems to be friendly and eager to make friends with everyone.  
他看起来友好且渴望与每个人交朋友。_

Rei studied Kaworu's face and his hands very carefully.  
丽仔细观察了薰的脸庞和他的双手。

There was a gentle smile formed by his thin lips, and they were like the lips of a poet laureate or an enlightened philosopher. There were his hands on the table, soft and slim, like they were the hands of a potter, a painter, or a musician. His red eyes... they were warm, thoughtful and expressive, as if they were begging to open her heart.  
他薄薄的嘴唇勾勒出一个温柔的微笑，宛如一位桂冠诗人或一位开悟哲学家的唇。他的手放在桌上，柔软而纤细，仿佛是陶艺家、画家或音乐家的手。他的红眼睛...它们温暖、深思且富有表现力，仿佛在恳求她敞开心扉。

Indeed, complete trust was such an elusive quality within a small number of people in a world of hatred and betrayal.  
确实，在充满仇恨与背叛的世界里，完全的信任是如此难以在少数人之间寻觅的品质。

The unscrupulous and the traitorous would abuse their trust, by playing their words and promises, and then manipulate and finally destroy the hapless victim whom they were supposed to help.  
那些无耻之徒和叛徒会滥用他们的信任，通过玩弄言辞和承诺，进而操纵并最终摧毁他们本应帮助的不幸受害者。

But those who truly knew the value of trust literally kept their word until their deaths... and from the way Kaworu was staring at Rei with those warm, compassionate red eyes... he could be trusted.  
但那些真正懂得信任价值的人，会字字守信直至生命尽头……而从渚薰用那双温暖、充满同情的红眼睛凝视绫波的方式来看……他是值得信赖的。

_Kaworu, I shall see if I can trust and know you,_ Rei decided before she took a breath for courage.  
渚薰，我会试着去信任并了解你，绫波在鼓起勇气前深吸了一口气，心中暗下决定。

"The Commander has also ordered me to socialize with the Fifth Children," she answered at last.  
"指挥官还命令我要与第五适格者们社交，"她最终回答道。

The two officers suddenly blinked.  
两位军官突然眨了眨眼。

_What? Come again?_ Misato questioned inwardly.  
什么？再说一遍？美里内心疑惑。

As if she felt Misato's reaction, Rei apologized softly. "Please forgive me, Major, but I simply follow orders. That is all I need to say."  
仿佛感受到了美里少校的反应，绫波轻声道歉。“请原谅我，少校，但我只是遵从命令。这就是我需要说的全部。”

Kaworu smiled. "Thank you, Ayanami," he answered. "I'll go with you."  
渚薰微笑道：“谢谢你，绫波。”他回答，“我会和你一起去的。”

Fuyutsuki sighed in relief. "Okay," he finally agreed to Misato. "I'll grant your leave for today, Major. Since I've checked the schedule myself, there will be no further activities this afternoon until the next morning."  
冬月松了口气，叹道：“好吧，”他最终同意了美里，“我今天批准你的休假，少校。既然我自己检查了日程，今天下午直到明天早上都不会有其他活动了。”

Misato felt relieved. "Thank you, sir."  
美里感到松了一口气。“谢谢您，长官。”

But the elderly man cleared his throat. "However, tomorrow, we have something very important, but rather sensitive to talk about," he informed. "I'll expect you to be in my office by eight, Major."  
但那位老者清了清喉咙。“不过，明天我们有一件非常重要但颇为敏感的事情要讨论，”他告知。“我希望你八点前到我办公室，美里少校。”

"Yes sir," Misato complied politely. "I'll be there."  
“是，长官，”美里礼貌地应允。“我会准时到的。”

Realizing that they hadn't finished their lunch, Fuyutsuki spoke. "Anyway, while we still have some time here, why don't we first enjoy our meal together?"  
意识到他们还没吃完午餐，冬月说道：“总之，既然我们还有些时间，不如先一起享用这顿饭吧？”

On the other side of the world, twelve ancient men were all hidden behind their digital monoliths, which were inscribed in red with their designation numbers and the words "Audio Only". The cabal discussed Kaworu's insertion into the Geofront, the disgraced Doctor Akagi and the tools of the Human Instrumentality Plan.  
在世界的另一端，十二位古代人各自隐藏在他们的数字巨石碑后，碑上以红色刻着他们的编号和“仅限音频”的字样。这个秘密团体讨论着渚薰进入地底都市的安排、失势的赤木博士以及人类补完计划的工具。

SEELE 01, presiding over this midnight meeting of this cabal, listened intently as the other Committee members talked. They always looked forward to the day when they would discover the true nature of the Void they called Heaven.  
SEELE 01 主持着这场午夜的秘密会议，专注地听着其他委员会成员的发言。他们始终期待着揭开他们称之为“天国”的虚空之真正本质的那一天。

"What is the current status of our envoy?" SEELE 02 questioned.  
"我们的使者目前状况如何？" SEELE 02 询问道。

"He is doing quite well, according to our inside contact within the Headquarters," SEELE 05 mentioned, referring to Kaworu. "His first compatibility test has been a success."  
"根据我们总部的内线消息，他目前表现相当不错，" SEELE 05 提到，指的是渚薰。"他的首次适配测试已经成功。"

"Excellent. Is he doing well with the other Children?" SEELE 08 asked.  
"很好。他与其他的孩子们相处得如何？" SEELE 08 问道。

"Yes, gentlemen, it is correct. Further follow-up observations from our source indicate that he is adapting well to the others, especially with the Third Children," SEELE 05 reported.  
“是的，先生们，这是正确的。我们来源的进一步跟踪观察显示，他与其他人适应良好，尤其是与第三适格者，”Seele 05 报告道。

"That shall do well to our Plan, since he is there to expose the weaknesses of the Headquarters and this imperfect Third Children. As for the Doctor, what is her status?" SEELE 06 asked about Ritsuko Akagi's situation.  
“这对我们的计划有利，既然他在那里揭露本部的弱点和这个不完美的第三适格者。至于那位博士，她的状况如何？”Seele 06 询问了赤木律子的情况。

They all remembered the last time she was in their presence, after Commander Ikari presented her for their questioning. Ritsuko had told them that she never felt any insult, and they were satisfied to know that there was a strong-tempered woman like her, close to the Commander. At the end of their meeting, they assigned Ritsuko as Rei's deputy.  
他们都记得上次她在他们面前出现，是在碇司令将她带来接受质询之后。赤木律子告诉他们，她从未感到任何侮辱，他们很满意知道有这样一位性格坚强的女性，接近司令。会议结束时，他们任命赤木律子为绫波的副手。

"She has been detained, supposedly for perceived insubordination, but our mole is still investigating the real reasons behind that incident," SEELE 03 explained flatly. "At least that defiant Doctor Akagi has rendered her very useful services to our Plan, even for a while."  
"她已被拘留，据称是因为被认为不服从，但我们的内线仍在调查该事件背后的真正原因，" SEELE 03 平淡地解释道。"至少那位桀骜不驯的赤木博士曾一度为我们的计划提供了极其有用的服务。"

"As for our Evas, the instruments of our implementation of the Plan, how far are we progressing in their construction?" SEELE 10 wondered aloud.  
"至于我们的 Eva，作为实施计划的关键工具，它们的建造进度如何？" SEELE 10 大声问道。"

SEELE 05 cleared his throat. "Eight of them are 78% operational, while the last one is currently being constructed in the incubation facility. Their Neo Point 400 heavy transport planes, along with their long-range escort fighters and tankers, are also being pre-positioned at the strategic staging area in Siberia."  
SEELE 05 清了清嗓子。"八台 Eva 已达到 78%的运行状态，最后一台正在孵化设施中建造。它们的 Neo Point 400 重型运输机，连同远程护航战斗机和加油机，也正在西伯利亚的战略集结区进行预置。"

Murmurs of agreement rose from the other members of the cabal.  
密谋者中响起了赞同的低语。

"And there is another piece of excellent news for us. Our trusted scientists overlooking the Mass-Production models are coming close to perfecting our Dummy Plug System," he confidently informed.  
“还有另一个好消息对我们来说。我们信任的科学家们负责监督量产模型，他们即将完善我们的 Dummy Plug 系统，”他自信地告知。

One of the Committee members groaned loudly.  
委员会成员中有人大声呻吟。

"What? How close? Please elaborate to us how close they are to finishing the Dummy Plugs," SEELE 10 complained. "Accuracy is a necessity in this quorum, and figures here are not based on guessing games."  
"什么？有多接近？请详细告诉我们他们完成 Dummy Plugs 的进度，" SEELE 10 抱怨道。"在这个会议上，准确性是必须的，这里的数字可不是靠猜的。"

Unfazed with this rebuke, as if he intended to irritate SEELE 10 for his secret amusement, SEELE 05 continued.  
面对这样的指责，SEELE 05 毫不动摇，仿佛有意激怒 SEELE 10 以满足他隐秘的娱乐，他继续说道。

"Gentlemen, to clarify this for your satisfaction, our Dummy Plugs are 97% complete and functional, with full thought patterns programmed into their systems," he explained politely, "And if the capabilities of these Plugs are to be seen, once they are inserted into our Evas, they are programmed to destroy anything in their path without hesitation."  
"先生们，为了满足你们的要求，我们的 Dummy Plugs 已经完成了 97%，并且功能齐全，系统中已经编入了完整的思维模式，"他礼貌地解释道，"而且，如果这些 Plug 的能力要被展示，一旦它们被插入我们的 Eva 中，它们会被编程为毫不犹豫地摧毁它们路径上的一切。"

"The path they will blaze through will be the shining Way for us to walk upon to the Promised Land," SEELE 01 finally agreed, his deep, rumbling Teutonic voice was authoritative, and brought the other Committee members to attention.  
“他们将开辟的道路，将成为我们通往应许之地的光辉之路，”SEELE 01 最终同意了，他那深沉而隆重的德语嗓音具有权威性，让其他委员会成员都集中了注意力。

"With these favorable developments," SEELE 01 continued, "coupled with the near-destruction of Tokyo-3, our full control of the Japanese government and the United Nations, and the insertion of our envoy into NERV. We shall always be one step ahead of Ikari and his little people. Since the great Final Day is coming as we progress triumphantly, our Evas must be completed as soon as possible."  
“随着这些有利的发展，”SEELE 01 继续说道，“再加上第三新东京市的近乎毁灭，我们对日本政府和联合国的全面控制，以及我们使节进入 NERV。我们将始终领先于碇和他的小团体一步。既然伟大的最终日正随着我们的胜利进程而来临，我们的 EVA 必须尽快完成。”

"Aye," the rest of the Committee concluded in unison. With everything ready, there was no doubt to all of them that they will be unstoppable as a firestorm.  
“是的，”委员会的其他成员一致同意。一切准备就绪，他们无疑都相信自己将如烈火风暴般势不可挡。

By now, everybody at the table sipped their drinks, with their bento boxes lay empty on the table, ready to be taken away by the passing cafeteria attendants.  
此时，桌上的每个人都已啜饮着各自的饮品，便当盒空空如也地摆在桌上，等待着路过的食堂服务员收走。

After emptying his glass of cold water, Fuyutsuki spoke to Misato in order to break the silence. "Major, I heard that they did well in the simulator exercise," he remarked. "In your opinion, do you think that they can handle any forthcoming attack?"  
在喝完杯中的冷水后，冬月向美里打破了沉默。"美里少校，我听说他们在模拟训练中表现不错，"他评论道，"依你之见，你认为他们能应对即将到来的攻击吗？"

Misato nodded. "Yes sir," she agreed, while Shinji and Kaworu nodded in acknowledgement. "In the battlefield, they managed to plan and execute their counter-attack efficiently within two minutes, so I believe that they can be combat-ready anytime."  
美里点头道："是的，长官，"她同意道，同时真嗣和渚也点头表示认同。"在战场上，他们能在两分钟内高效地规划并执行反击，所以我相信他们随时都能做好战斗准备。"

"Very good," Fuyutsuki commended while he slowly gazed at the First Children, wondering if the girl still was doing fine from the day after Unit-00 blew up.  
“很好，”冬月赞许道，同时缓缓扫视着初号机驾驶员们，心中揣测着零号机爆炸次日，那女孩是否安然无恙。

_I would like to say this,_ Fuyutsuki contemplated, _but judging from my observations. there's no doubt that Rei is quite troubled with herself._  
我想说这一点，冬月思忖着，但从我的观察来看，毫无疑问，绫波内心颇为困扰。

_Indeed,_ _I feel that in her current state she showed no sign of recalling everything or asking about the facts before the sortie, nor has she ever exhibited any behavior like the last. But still I wonder if she's handling herself favorably in private._  
确实，以她目前的状态来看，她并未表现出回忆起一切或询问出击前事实的迹象，也未曾显露出上次那样的行为。但我仍好奇她在私下里是否能妥善自处。

_Maybe... or maybe not,_ he doubted.  
或许...也可能不是，他心存疑虑。

Fuyutsuki also recalled his personal conversation with Gendo regarding Rei.  
冬月也回想起他与碇源堂关于绫波的个人谈话。

_Gendo nodded in satisfaction. "The incident will be to our advantage," he spoke. "We'll maintain the First Children's present status, because I have the third Rei copy activated at this moment."  
碇源堂满意地点头。“这次事件对我们有利，”他说道，“我们将保持第一适格者的现状，因为我已经激活了第三个绫波复制体。”_

_But Fuyutsuki frowned. "Yet," he doubted. "If they find out that Rei is alive, Chairman Lorenz and the Committee will blame us for this mistake."  
但冬月皱起了眉头。“然而，”他怀疑道，“如果他们发现丽还活着，洛伦兹主席和委员会会因为我们这个错误而责怪我们。”_

_Instead Gendo smirked. "That will not be a hindrance," he answered. "Instead, I think that we will be better off presenting someone else to the anxious old men."  
相反，碇源堂却露出了冷笑。“那不会成为障碍，”他回答道，“相反，我认为我们应该向那些焦虑的老家伙们展示另一个人。”_

_"Then whom shall you come up with?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
“那么你会提出谁呢？”冬月问道。_

_"Doctor Akagi," Gendo answered without blinking an eye. "She'll be Rei's substitute, and I do not want a doubtful child to face the Committee, no matter how much they insist on bringing any of them in there."  
“赤城医生，”源度不眨眼地回答，“她将作为绫波的替代品，我不希望一个疑虑重重的女孩面对委员会，无论他们多么坚持要把任何一个带进去。”_

Fuyutsuki groaned, knowing that against his will, sacrifices were made in the advancement of the Human Instrumentality Plan, its painful weight hefted upon an emotionally fragile Shinji Ikari.  
冬月叹息，明知违背己愿，为了人类补完计划的推进，牺牲在所难免，这份痛苦的负担被强加在一个情感脆弱的碇真嗣身上。

Yes, people were maimed in the crossfire from the time the Third Angel attacked, but there were also billions of them who died in this costly path created by the Plan, and he knew only a few names out of that number: Misato's father in Antarctica. Naoko. Kaji. The first two Reis, whom he created under great pressure and reluctance. And this time, Asuka in the Infirmary, her dreamless slumber in a white-washed prison cell.  
是的，从第三使徒袭击开始，人们在交火中伤残，但也有数十亿人在这条由计划开辟的代价高昂的道路上丧生，他只知道其中寥寥几个名字：南极的律子父亲。直子。加持。前两个绫波，他在巨大压力和不情愿下创造的。而这次，是医务室的明日香，她在白色牢房中无梦的沉睡。

They were statistics in population census charts, ill-starred pawns in this bloody Plan, all in Gendo's single-minded pursuit of getting his wife back.  
他们是人口普查图表上的统计数字，是这个血腥计划中不幸的棋子，全都在碇源堂一心一意追求复活妻子的执念中。

Changing his mind, the elderly Sub-Commander also thought of this newcomer in their midst, having nothing but a blank slate of an identity, an enigma from the Committee for them to solve. He also wondered if this Kaworu Nagisa was a blessing, or if he possibly had a bigger role in the Plan.  
改变主意后，年长的副司令也想到了他们中间的这个新来者，除了一个空白的身份，他是一个来自委员会的谜团，等待他们去解开。他也想知道，这个渚薰是福还是祸，或者他在这个计划中可能扮演着更重要的角色。

So he felt compelled to ask a few simple questions to those Children.  
因此，他觉得有必要向那些孩子们提出几个简单的问题。

"Mister Nagisa," Fuyutsuki spoke.

"Excuse me, sir?" Kaworu answered, brought to attention as he put down his half-full teacup.  
“不好意思，先生？” 渚薰应声抬头，放下手中半满的茶杯。

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat. "I assessed your performance since yesterday," he remarked, "and I believe that it is quite remarkable that you did well on the first try, judging from your sync ratio results, Mister Nagisa."  
冬月清了清嗓子。“我从昨天开始评估你的表现，”他评论道，“考虑到你的同步率结果，第一次尝试就能做得这么好，真是相当出色，渚先生。”

"Sir, I was able to do around 70%," Kaworu replied. "I was given extensive training in all aspects of piloting for three years, including combat, weapons familiarization and use, and battlefield tactics," he lied without hesitation.  
“先生，我大约能做到 70%，”渚薰回答。“我在所有驾驶方面接受了三年的全面训练，包括战斗、武器熟悉与使用，以及战场战术，”他毫不犹豫地撒谎道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "I see," he agreed. "That would explain for those exceptionally good scores."  
冬月点了点头。“我明白了，”他同意道，“这就能解释那些异常优异的成绩了。”

"I acknowledge that, sir," Kaworu responded.  
“我承认这一点，先生，”渚薰回答道。

"Very well, then," Fuyutsuki pleasantly replied. "Regarding your commendable performance since yesterday and more so especially with Mister Ikari this morning. Keep up the good work, Mister Nagisa."  
“很好，那么，”冬月愉快地回答，“鉴于你从昨天开始，尤其是今天早上与碇君的出色表现。继续保持，渚君。”

"Thank you sir," Kaworu gratefully answered, before the Sub-Commander turned his attention to Rei.  
"谢谢您，先生。" 薰感激地回答，随后副司令将注意力转向了绫波。

"Just in case I need to know, Miss Ayanami..." Fuyutsuki said, using the girl's surname instead. "How do you feel right now, especially since it's been several days after your last sortie?"  
"以防万一我需要了解，绫波小姐……" 冬月说道，使用了女孩的姓氏。"你现在感觉如何，特别是自从你上次出击已经过去好几天了？"

"I am well, sir," Rei dutifully replied.  
"我很好，先生。" 绫波恭敬地回答道。

"I know that, young woman, but are there any other problems regarding your recovery?"  
"我知道这一点，年轻的小姐，但关于你的康复还有其他问题吗？"

Rei shook her head softly, which Fuyutsuki respectfully took as a gesture that she didn't want more prying questions, for that was Gendo's jurisdiction.  
丽轻轻地摇了摇头，冬月恭敬地理解为她不想再被追问，因为那是源堂的管辖范围。

However, Toji politely cut in.  
然而，冬二礼貌地插话道。

"I'm sorry to interrupt, sir," he said. "But I'm doing better even after. You know what I mean. And what's more, sir, I'm also happy to see that my sister's out of the hospital... She's now staying home back at Tokyo-2."  
"很抱歉打扰您，先生，"他说道，"但即便如此，我感觉自己状态更好了。您明白我的意思。而且，先生，我也很高兴得知我妹妹已经出院了……她现在回到了东京-2 的家中。"

"Good for you, Mister Suzuhara," Fuyutsuki agreed, noting the young man's arm. "I take it as a good fortune to see that you and Shinji are friends once again, and I hope that you'll recover soon from those disabilities. Your medical expenses will be continually taken care of, and we'll hold on to that promise."  
"这很好，铃原先生，"冬月赞同地说，注意到年轻人的手臂。"看到你和真嗣再次成为朋友，我感到非常幸运，希望你能尽快从那些伤残中恢复过来。你的医疗费用将继续得到照顾，我们会坚守这个承诺。"

Toji nodded. "Thank you, sir," he replied.  
东治点点头。"谢谢您，先生，"他回答道。

"But..." Fuyutsuki trailed away. "Regarding Miss Langley," he remarked seriously. "I'm also sorry for what happened to her, and as far as I know..."  
“但是……” 冬月渐渐没了声音。“关于兰利小姐，”他严肃地说道。“我也为她所遭遇的事情感到抱歉，就我所知……”

"She'll be home soon," Misato answered. "We know about that, sir. I am also aware of what happened to Kaji. Fact is, sir... She adored him so much that his... death devastated her."  
"她很快就会回家，" 美里回答道。"我们了解情况，长官。我也知道加治的事情。事实上，长官……她非常爱他，他的……去世对她打击很大。"

Fuyutsuki sighed, somberly remembering the last words Kaji had told him after he was rescued.  
冬月叹了口气，忧郁地回想起加治在被救出后对他说的最后一句话。

_Fuyutsuki blinked. "Oh, it's you," he said as the agent untied the ropes around the elder officer's hands.  
冬月眨了眨眼。“哦，是你啊，”他看着特工解开老长官手上的绳索说道。_

_Kajii smiled. "It's been a while, sir."  
加吉微笑道：“好久不见，长官。”_

_"But..." Fuyutsuki replied as he rose from his chair. "Sooner or later, what you're doing will get you killed... You're a marked man now," he warned.  
“但是……” 冬月回答着从椅子上站起身。“迟早，你所做的一切会要了你的命……你现在是个被盯上的人了，”他警告道。_

_However, Kaji shrugged, as if the inevitable was just the part of the job.  
然而，Kaji 耸了耸肩，仿佛不可避免的事情只是工作的一部分。_

_"Sir, I just want to get closer to the truth," Kaji admitted as they walked out of the room. "It's the truth within me. Besides, it seems they're catching on to the fact that I smuggled the Adam sample for Commander Ikari."  
“先生，我只是想接近真相，”他们走出房间时，加持坦承道，“这是我内心的真相。而且，他们似乎已经察觉到我为碇指挥官走私亚当样本的事了。”_

_"Yes, I know that many people wanted to stop you, but what happens next?" Fuyutsuki questioned, rubbing the reddish-raw skin on his wrists.  
“是的，我知道很多人想阻止你，但接下来会发生什么？”Fuyutsuki 问道，揉着发红的手腕。_

_"If I don't start looking out for myself," Kaji continued, "things could be looking grim for me."  
“如果我不开始为自己打算，”加持继续说，“我的处境可能会变得很糟糕。”_

As if to pay due respect to the poor girl and the now-gone secret agent, there was a moment of solemn silence over their table, amid the chatter around them. With the exception of Kaworu and Rei, the other diners had their own thoughts and recollections about Asuka and Kaji.  
仿佛是为了向那位可怜的女孩和现已消失的间谍表示应有的敬意，他们的桌子周围在周围的嘈杂声中出现了一刻肃穆的沉默。除了渚薰和绫波之外，其他食客各自心中都有着对明日香和加持的思绪和回忆。

But out of a wish, Shinji broke that silence. "I wanted to see her awake once more," he whispered. "Because..."  
但出于一个愿望，真嗣打破了那片沉默。“我想再见她醒来的样子。”他低声说道，“因为……”

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Come again?"  
冬月眨了眨眼。“再说一遍？”

"Because, sir..." Shinji admitted, "I would like to talk to Asuka, just to settle our differences... There's not a night where I'm not worried about her, even if she..." He stopped abruptly, almost saying "she hates everyone".  
"“因为，老师……”真嗣坦白道，“我想和明日香谈谈，只是为了化解我们的分歧……没有一夜我不为她担忧，即使她……”他突然停住，差点说出“她讨厌所有人”。

However, Fuyutsuki knew that there was considerable disagreement between those two Children especially that Asuka was more adamant in fruitlessly pursuing her goal to be the best... even if that effort had almost cost her life.  
然而，冬月知道这两位孩子之间存在着相当大的分歧，尤其是明日香更加固执地追求成为最好的目标，即便这种努力几乎让她付出了生命的代价。

"Don't worry about that, young man," Fuyutsuki replied, to inject self-faith and hope in Shinji's heart. "I know what you feel about Asuka, and I also believe that she'll recover quickly."  
“年轻人，别担心，”冬月回答道，试图在真嗣心中注入自信和希望。“我了解你对明日香的感情，我也相信她会很快康复。”

Shinji nodded. "Thank you, sir... I'll keep that hope in mind."  
真嗣点点头。“谢谢您，先生……我会牢记这份希望。”

"That's better," Fuyutsuki answered, as he watched Toji pat Shinji on the shoulder.  
"这样好多了," 冬月回答道，他看着真治拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。

Seeing that everything has been settled with, Fuyutsuki rose from his seat. "Well," he spoke, "On a good note, I guess that concludes our lunch, so I would like to thank you for allowing me to join in and share your thoughts."  
看到一切都已安排妥当，冬月从座位上站起身来。“好吧，”他说道，“算是个好消息吧，我想我们的午餐就这样结束了，感谢你们让我加入并分享你们的想法。”

"Thank you, sir," Misato politely agreed as she and the Children stood up together. "It's a great honor to have your presence."  
“谢谢您，先生，”美里礼貌地回应，她和孩子们一起站了起来。“您的到来是我们的荣幸。”

"My pleasure, Major," Fuyutsuki responded as he nodded. "I'll see you all tomorrow."  
“我的荣幸，美里少校，”冬月点头回应。“明天见。”

By unspoken agreement, they let Fuyutsuki leave, watching him walk away before they turned their attention to themselves, preparing to depart.  
他们默契地让冬月离开，目送他走远后才将注意力转向自己，准备启程。

"I hope that all of you three will have a good journey," Kaworu remarked as he straightened out, while Rei silently put her seat back into its place.  
“希望你们三位旅途愉快，”渚薰说着挺直了身子，而绫波丽则默默地将座椅恢复原位。

Misato nodded. "Thanks," she answered. "Have a great time at the pool, you two."  
美里点头道：“谢谢。”她回答，“你们俩去泳池玩得开心。”

Kaworu politely nodded, before he gestured Rei to leave their seats, and let her lead the way.  
渚薰礼貌地点了点头，示意绫波离开座位，让她带路。

But just as the two other Children took another step, Rei looked back at Shinji and their eyes met for a second. The young man's deep-blue eyes seemed to ask for something.  
但就在另外两个孩子再迈出一步时，绫波回头看向真嗣，两人的目光短暂交汇。少年深蓝色的眼眸似乎在寻求着什么。

Kaworu blinked and hesitated. "What's the problem?" he asked the hesitating girl, before he saw her staring at the other boy.  
渚薰眨了眨眼，犹豫了一下。“有什么问题吗？”他问着犹豫的女孩，随后注意到她正盯着另一个男孩。

"A... Ayanami," Shinji spoke uneasily, trying to overcome his nervousness while Toji looked at his two classmates. Even Misato paused, halfway in picking up her purse.  
"绫...绫波," 真嗣不安地说道，试图克服自己的紧张情绪，而东治则看着他的两个同学。就连美里也停了下来，正准备拿起她的钱包。

"Pardon me?" the girl replied.  
"你说什么？" 女孩回答道。

Shinji smiled softly. "Thanks for joining with us for lunch," he replied. "I'll see you again..."  
真嗣温柔地笑了笑。"谢谢你和我们一起吃午饭，" 他回答说，"我们还会再见面的..."

Kaworu and Rei nodded, but only the Fifth Children responded with a smile. "Okay, my friend. Just remember my advice and put it to good use."  
渚薰和绫波点了点头，但只有第五适格者回以微笑。“好的，我的朋友。记得我的建议，好好利用它。”

Toji grinned. "Yeah, he should do so," he said, patting his remaining hand on Shinji's shoulder. "And do you know what, Kaworu?"  
真嗣咧嘴一笑。“是啊，他应该这么做，”他说着，用剩下的手拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。“你知道吗，渚薰？”

"Is it something good?" Kaworu asked.  
“是好事吗？”渚薰问道。

"Yeah, you sound really cool in my book. You're going with the flow," Toji remarked cheerfully. "I'd hope you'll hang out with us again pretty soon once things here get back to normal."  
“是啊，你在我看来真的很酷。随波逐流嘛，”冬二愉快地评论道，“希望这里恢复正常后，你能很快再和我们一起玩。”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes," he agreed. "Thank you for your friendly offer, Suzuhara."  
渚薰点头。“是的，”他同意道，“谢谢你的友好邀请，铃原。”

Still grinning, Toji gave him a victory sign. "Right on!" he replied loudly while Shinji nodded.  
冬二依旧笑着，向他比了个胜利的手势。“太棒了！”他大声回应，而真嗣也点头表示同意。

"Let's go, boys," Misato said, before she turned her attention at the pair. "I'll see you two tomorrow. Is that clear?"  
"我们走吧，小伙子们," 美里说道，然后转向那对搭档。"明天见你们两个。清楚了吗？"

Kaworu and Rei nodded in unison. "Yes, ma'am," they answered. Shinji waved his hand in return while Toji winked, before they walked away.  
薰和丽同步点头。"是的，女士," 他们回答。真嗣挥手回应，而真治眨了眨眼，然后他们一起离开了。

---

Once they were left alone, Kaworu and Rei walked to one of the elevators outside the cafeteria and he pressed the button for the elevator to go down.  
一旦他们独处，薰和绫波便走向食堂外的一部电梯，他按下按钮让电梯下行。

While they waited, Kaworu asked. "We're going to my room to pick up my swimming trunks, and... Did the Commander really...?"  
"在他们等待的时候，渚薰问道。“我们要去我房间拿我的泳裤，还有……司令真的……？””

Rei turned to him and answered. "Yes, as I have earlier mentioned, he has given me orders to socialize with you, Nagisa."  
"绫波零转向他并回答。“是的，正如我之前提到的，他命令我和你社交，渚。””

Kaworu smiled. "I should be very thankful," he remarked, feeling relieved. "I thought he was very strict with you when it comes to making friends."  
"渚薰微笑着。“我应该非常感激，”他松了口气地说，“我以为他在交友方面对你非常严格。””

Rei didn't return a reply, and soon the elevator doors opened, the two walked inside in unison.  
丽没有回应，很快电梯门打开了，两人同步走了进去。

As the elevator lurched downwards, Kaworu asked the girl carefully. "Pardon me, but was there anything wrong with what I said?"  
电梯缓缓下降时，薰小心翼翼地问女孩：“对不起，我刚才说的话有什么不妥吗？”

Rei shook her head softly. "No, but the Commander always insists that everyone must follow his orders."  
丽轻轻摇了摇头。“没有，但司令总是坚持每个人都必须遵守他的命令。”

Kaworu blinked. "Including you and me?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。“包括你和我？”

"Yes," Rei confirmed, "even if there are any objections from us."  
“是的，”绫波零确认道，“即使我们中有任何异议。”

---

At the same time, in his vast, Sephirotic-styled office, Gendo Ikari could only think after he finally finished reading the stack of reports sitting on his desk. As he pondered, he felt confident that he would get to execute his version of the Plan before the Committee could implement theirs.  
与此同时，在他那宽敞、风格类似萨菲罗特的办公室里，碇源堂终于读完了桌上的一摞报告。在沉思中，他自信能在委员会实施他们的计划之前执行自己的版本。

It was a matter of perfect mathematical timing, with every piece falling into the right place, and nothing in this world would stop him, not even the all-powerful SEELE.  
这一切都是完美的数学时机，每个环节都恰到好处，在这个世界上没有任何事物能阻止他，即便是无所不能的 SEELE 也不例外。

While he believed himself to be a man of infinite patience, Gendo already knew that the appointed day was coming, for the Committee has shown anxiety through their voices despite the huge black monoliths surrounding him.  
尽管他认为自己是个极有耐心的人，源度已经知道那个指定的日子即将到来，因为委员会的声音中透露出了焦虑，尽管他周围环绕着巨大的黑色巨石。

_Though my time is running out, I will show those unbelievers what wonders I can still make,_ he told himself, thinking of the scheming German who pestered him for the Plan's completion. _Two can play this game, and I will be one step ahead even as they throw everything at me._  
虽然我的时间不多了，我会向那些不相信的人展示我还能创造的奇迹，他对自己说，想起了那个不断催促他完成计划的狡猾德国人。两人可以玩这个游戏，即使他们对我倾尽全力，我也会领先一步。

The bearded Commander smirked before he glanced at his watch, and realizing that it was time to eat, stood up from his seat and buttoned up his black coat.  
留着胡须的指挥官微微一笑，然后瞥了一眼手表，意识到是时候吃饭了，便从座位上站起来，扣上了他的黑色外套。

Walking away from the desk and adjusting his amber eyeglasses, even the most Machiavellian of leaders deserved to eat their lunch, as Gendo recalled a remote vision from the past, of dear Yui handing him a rich bento box of tuna sashimi and rice.  
离开办公桌，调整着琥珀色的眼镜，即便是最高明的权谋者也该享用午餐，源堂回想起过去遥远的一幕，亲爱的唯递给他一个装满金枪鱼刺身和米饭的丰盛便当盒。

### Chapter 8 One Lazy Afternoon  
Chapter 8 一个慵懒的下午

Back at their apartment, the first thing Misato Katsuragi did upon their arrival was to contact Hikari Horaki, so she walked over to the small table where the telephone was, minus the answering machine; a press of the memory button on the phone speed-dialed the new number of the Class Rep's home in Tokyo-2.  
回到公寓后，葛城美智留做的第一件事就是联系光莉穂木，于是她走到放着电话的小桌旁，那里没有答录机；按下电话上的记忆按钮，快速拨号到了班长在第二新东京的新家号码。

Misato picked up the receiver and waited for the girl to respond.  
美智留拿起听筒，等待着女孩的回应。

"Hello, this is the Horaki household. What can I do for you?" the girl at the other side of the line asked.  
“您好，这里是洞木家。有什么可以帮您的吗？”电话那头的女孩问道。

"Hello! Hey, Hikari, how are you doing?" Misato spoke.  
"你好！嘿，光，你怎么样？" 美里说道。

"Major Katsuragi! What? Ehy did you call up?" Hikari asked. "Oh, I see. You're with Toji? I thought he's going home."  
"葛城少校！什么？为什么打电话来？" 光问道。"哦，我明白了。你和真嗣在一起？我以为他要回家了。"

"Yes," Misato answered. "We're also bringing Toji home, but can you do me a favor?"  
"是的，" 美里回答，"我们还要送真嗣回家，不过你能帮我个忙吗？"

"Sure, and what's the deal?" the girl asked.  
"当然可以，是什么事呢？" 女孩问道。"

Misato smiled a bit and answered. "I have to leave Pen-Pen in your care."  
美里微微一笑，回答道："我得把 Pen-Pen 托付给你照顾。"

"Oh, I like that! I'll handle him," Hikari beamed. "Right now, I'm fixing some goodies at the kitchen. Hold on a sec, please?" she informed.  
"哦，我喜欢这个！我来对付他，"光笑着说。"现在我在厨房做些好吃的。请稍等一下，好吗？"她告知。

The next thing Misato heard muffled sounds, as if the girl was covering the phone up quickly with her hand and screaming something at someone.  
紧接着，Misato 听到一阵模糊的声音，仿佛那个女孩迅速用手捂住电话，对着某人大声喊着什么。

"Um. What's going on in there?" Misato asked. "Hello?"  
"嗯。里面发生了什么？"美里问道。"喂？"

"It's me again," Hikari answered back after a few seconds. "Sorry for the interruption."  
"又是我，"几秒钟后，光回答道。"抱歉打扰了。"

"Who's with you?" “谁跟你一起？”

"It's Kensuke," Hikari admitted. "He's trying to sneak in and snatch off what I've got on the dinner table."  
“是健介，”光子承认道，“他想偷偷溜进来，把我桌上的东西抢走。”

Misato smiled a little. "He's the same old nut, am I right?"  
美里微微一笑。“他还是老样子，对吧？”

"Yeah," Hikari agreed. "I also have Toji's sister with me, and she's helping."  
“嗯，”光点头同意，“我这里还有冬二的妹妹，她也在帮忙。”

"How is she?" “她怎么样？”

"Mari's been okay ever since she got out of the Infirmary," Hikari answered as she cradled the phone on her shoulder, while mincing a few pieces of onions on the chopping board. The girl then made a few glances at Mari, who watched the simmering pots on the stove.  
"“自从玛丽从医务室出来后，她一直挺好的，”光一边回答，一边将电话夹在肩膀上，手起刀落切着洋葱。她不时瞥向玛丽，玛丽正盯着炉子上炖着的锅。”

"I see," Misato said, quite glad to hear this bit of good news. "Um, pardon me, but where are your sisters?"  
"我明白了，" 美里说道，听到这个好消息颇为高兴。"呃，抱歉打扰，你的姐妹们呢？"

"They went out shopping," Hikari spoke. "They'll be back by five."  
"她们出去购物了，" 光说道。"五点前会回来的。"

"Okay."

"Now I forgot to ask, but where are the guys?"  
"现在我忘了问，但那些男生们呢？"

Misato turned around to see Toji playing chase with Pen-Pen in the adjoining living room, and noticed that Shinji wasn't there.  
美里转过身，看到真治在隔壁的起居室里和 Pen-Pen 玩追逐游戏，注意到真嗣不在那里。

"Toji's with Pen-Pen, but Shinji is in his bedroom," Misato answered. "He's getting ready."  
“真治和 Pen-Pen 在一起，但真嗣在他的卧室，”美里回答。“他正在准备。”

"Oh," Hikari groaned. "I should've asked about Shinji. How's he doing?"  
“哦，”光子叹了口气。“我应该问问真嗣的。他怎么样了？”

"Nothing serious, despite what happened between them. Fact is, he and Toji have managed to get their friendship back on track," Misato said.  
“没什么大不了的，尽管他们之间发生了那些事。事实上，他和真嗣已经设法修复了他们的友谊，”美里说道。

"That's better," Hikari agreed, but a thought crossed her mind and she asked one more question-the fate of her best friend. "What about Asuka?"  
“那就好，”光赞同道，但一个念头闪过她的脑海，她又问了一个问题——她最好朋友的命运。“那明日香呢？”

Misato blinked twice. The phone wasn't the right medium to discuss a very painful matter.  
美里眨了两次眼。电话并不是讨论一件非常痛苦事情的合适媒介。

"I... I'm afraid that Shinji and I have to explain it all to you later on," she whispered, before she heard a muted groan from Hikari.  
“我……恐怕我和真嗣得稍后向你解释一切，”她低声说道，随即听到了光的一声闷哼。

"Ah. I got the idea. We'll be waiting for you instead," the girl answered.  
“啊，我明白了。我们会等你。”女孩回答道。

"Yes," Misato responded. "No problem with that."  
“是的，”美里回应道，“没问题。”

"Thanks for calling," Hikari said. "Goodbye."  
"感谢来电，"光说。"再见。"

"I'll see you. Bye," Misato spoke before she put the phone back into its cradle. She thought of how the story would be told once they come face to face.  
"再见，"美里说完才将电话放回听筒。她想着当他们面对面时，这个故事将如何被讲述。

In his bedroom and dressed more comfortably in his khaki cargo pants and a white T-shirt, Shinji picked up his SDAT player from his desk and put it into his green backpack. Thinking that the journey would be long, he also stuffed in some comic books, several SDAT mix tapes, two big bags of rice crackers and toiletries. The lithium batteries went in as well, just in case he needed more juice for his player.  
在卧室里，穿着更为舒适的卡其色工装裤和白色 T 恤，真嗣从书桌上拿起他的 SDAT 播放器，放入他的绿色背包中。考虑到旅途漫长，他还塞进了一些漫画书、几盘 SDAT 混音带、两大袋米饼和洗漱用品。锂电池也一并放入，以防播放器电量不足。

Having finished packing his stuff and zipping the backpack shut, the young man's eyes, caught by the pictures on the desk, stared at them for a moment.  
整理好物品并拉上背包拉链后，年轻人的目光被桌上的照片吸引，凝视了片刻。

Shinji found himself wondering what had gone disastrously wrong after their brief time of unity.  
真嗣发现自己不禁疑惑，在那短暂的团结时刻之后，究竟是什么灾难性地出了错。

Shinji gazed at one portrait with Rei and Asuka on his desk, a reminder of those better days. Kensuke had taken a shot of them during lunch break, with the red-haired girl hovering over him and the First Children, her arms on their shoulders while she smiled.  
真嗣凝视着桌上一张与绫波和明日香的合影，那是那些美好日子的提醒。这张照片是健司在午休时抓拍的，红发女孩俯身在他和第一适格者之间，手臂搭在他们的肩上，微笑着。

It had been such a great time when their team cohesion was at their finest. They had fought the Angel that accompanied the massive blackout in the Geofront:  
那是一段团队凝聚力达到巅峰的美好时光。他们曾共同对抗伴随大规模停电出现在地底都市的使徒：

_In the confines of the massive ventilation and access shafts that spanned and crisscrossed beneath Tokyo-3, the three Children in their Evas spoke through their communication consoles and were devising a quick plan for a quick kill. About 200 meters below, their only offensive weapon was at the bottom of the shaft, which they had dropped earlier as the Angel made its surprise attack on the colossal trio.  
在东京-3 下方纵横交错、错综复杂的巨大通风与通道管道中，三位驾驶 EVA 的孩子们通过通讯控制台商讨着速战速决的计划。约 200 米之下，他们唯一的攻击武器已在前不久天使发动突袭时被丢弃在管道底部。_

"_The Angel is trying to destroy Headquarters using its own secreted acid drops," Rei informed them after she saw how the acid did to boil away rock and steel, close enough to burn through their thickly-layered armor plating._  
“天使正试图用其分泌的酸液摧毁总部，”绫波在目睹酸液如何将岩石与钢铁熔化至足以穿透他们厚重的装甲板后，向他们报告道。

_Shinji frowned. "What shall we do?" he lamented.  
真嗣皱起眉头，“我们该怎么办？”他忧心忡忡地问道。_

"_We'll destroy it, of course!" Asuka shot back._  
“当然是要摧毁它！”明日香立刻回击道。

_The young man groaned. "Sure, but how are you gonna do it?" he asked. "I dropped my rifle and the batteries on our backs are running low. We'll able to move for no more than three minutes."  
年轻人呻吟了一声。“当然，但你打算怎么做？”他问道，“我的步枪掉了，我们背上的电池也快耗尽了。我们最多只能再移动三分钟。”_

_A minute passed before Asuka snapped her fingers, bringing the other Children to attention.  
一分钟过去了，明日香突然打了个响指，让其他孩子们都集中了注意力。_

"_Hey, I have a plan," she announced as a smile lit up her face._  
"嘿，我有个计划，"她宣布道，脸上绽放出笑容。

_Shinji cocked an eye at the red-haired girl. "What?"  
真嗣斜眼看着红发女孩。“什么？”_

"_This'll work for us," Asuka spoke, and then she outlined her game plan. "Listen up! Defense stays here, neutralizes the AT-field, and protects Offense from the Angel's acid burn."_  
"这对我们有用," 明日香说道，然后她概述了她的游戏计划。"听着！防守留在这里，中和 AT 力场，保护进攻免受使徒的酸液烧伤。"

_Shinji and Rei nodded in unison and understood the first part of their initiative. "I see," he agreed. "What's next?"  
真嗣和丽齐齐点头，理解了计划的第一部分。“我明白了，”他同意道，“接下来呢？”_

"_Our Backup goes down, picks up the rifle and gives it to our Offense," Asuka continued. "Finally, our Offense destroys the target with the gun."_  
“我们的支援队员下去，捡起步枪并交给进攻方，”明日香继续解释，“最后，进攻方用枪摧毁目标。”

"_Who's gonna be the Defense?" Shinji asked, staring at the two girls on the heads-up display._  
“谁来担任防守？”真嗣问道，目光盯着抬头显示器上的两个女孩。

"_I shall take my position as Defense," Rei answered._  
"我将担任防守位置，"丽回答道。

_However, Asuka shook her head and smiled. "Sorry, but I'm doing it. I wanted to try what it's like to work differently."  
然而，明日香摇了摇头，微笑着说："抱歉，但我来做。我想尝试一下不同的工作方式是什么感觉。"_

"_But it's too dangerous," Shinji warned, shaking his head._  
"但这太危险了，"真嗣警告道，摇着头。

"_So what? Danger is what I live for," Asuka answered. "I'll feel crazy unless I get even with you for the last battle. Shinji, you're gonna be the Offense. Wondergirl will be our Backup, is that clear?"_  
"那又怎样？危险正是我所追求的，" 明日香回答道。"不跟你算上一场，我心里不爽。真嗣，你来担任进攻。绫波会是我们后备，清楚了吗？"

_Rei nodded. "I understand," she agreed. The girl quickly got hold of the controls, reanimating the one-eyed giant to crawl up behind Unit-01.  
绫波点头。"我明白了，"她同意道。女孩迅速掌握了控制，让独眼巨人重新活动起来，爬到初号机后面。_

_As she watched Unit-00 crawl to the far end, Asuka visualized their positions in the shaft, with Unit-02 at the top to serve as a shield, Unit-01 in the middle of the stack, and Unit-00 to get the rifle at the bottom of the shaft.  
当她看着零号机爬向远处时，明日香在脑海中描绘出它们在竖井中的位置，二号机位于顶部作为盾牌，初号机位于中间，而零号机则在底部获取步枪。_

"_Let's go!" Asuka yelled back for added courage, nudging Unit-02 onward to the head of the line._  
“我们走！”明日香大声回应以增添勇气，推动零二号机向前，领头前行。

"_Uh!" Shinji gasped as Unit-01 grabbed its weapon, right behind Asuka and kept still, prepared to crawl out. "Okay!"_  
“呃！”真嗣倒吸一口气，零一号机紧握武器，紧随明日香之后保持静止，准备爬出。“好的！”

"_All right," Asuka finally announced. "On my count to three, we'll file out of this cave and blow the hell out of that sucker right above us. Are you ready?"_  
“好了，”明日香终于宣布道，“我数到三，我们就从这个洞穴里鱼贯而出，把头顶那家伙炸个稀巴烂。准备好了吗？”

_Rei and Shinji responded on their comlink consoles with respective nods.  
丽和真嗣通过各自的通讯控制台点头回应。_

"_One..." Asuka counted, as she imagined the Angel waiting for them aboveground._  
“一……”明日香数着，想象着地面上等待他们的使徒。

"_Two..."_

"_Three!"_

_The Evas immediately burst out of the lateral shaft, with Unit-02 climbing up above Unit-01, while Unit-00 dropped to the bottom, retrorockets fired to slow down her descent. As soon she was on the bottom, Unit-00 picked up the rifle and readied it to be tossed up.  
EVA 机体立即从侧向通道冲出，零号机爬升至初号机上方，而零号机则下降至底部，启动反向火箭减缓下降速度。一到达底部，零号机便拾起步枪，准备将其抛向上方。_

_Just as Unit-01 and Unit-02 plant their limbs across the width of the vertical shaft, the Angel above excreted its corrosive load and acid scorched the red armor of the titan. Asuka could hear the hissing sound of acid eating halfway through.  
正当零号机和二号机将四肢横跨在垂直井道时，上方的使徒喷射出腐蚀性物质，酸液灼烧着巨人的红色装甲。明日香能听到酸液侵蚀至一半的嘶嘶声。_

"_Hurry!" Asuka yelled as the HUD indicators screamed EXOSKELETON ARMOR DAMAGED in blinking red, but Rei never missed a beat as Unit-00 threw the rifle upward for Shinji to grab it._  
“快点！”明日香大喊，HUD 显示屏上闪烁着红色的“外骨骼装甲受损”警告，但绫波零丝毫不慌，零零号机将步枪向上抛给真嗣接住。

"_Safeties off," Shinji whispered as Unit-01 switched the weapon from "Safe" to "Fire". He also swore he could hear a metallic 'click'._  
“解除保险，”真嗣低语，零一号机将武器从“安全”切换到“射击”。他发誓自己还听到了一声金属的‘咔嚓’声。

_Unit-01 swung the rifle upward to the sky, with Unit-02 making way for the stream of bullets by readjusting its position. Now Shinji could see the silhouette of the Angel's spidery hulk, right in the middle of targeting cursors and crosshairs.  
零一号机将步枪向上空挥去，与此同时，零二号机调整位置为其让出射击路径。现在，真嗣能够清晰地看到天使那蜘蛛般的庞大身影，正好位于瞄准光标和十字准线的中心。_

_He heard the lock tone and focused his vision at the enemy, while the world around him suddenly seemed to slow down. "Target center..."  
他听到了锁定音，将视线集中在敌人身上，而周围的世界似乎突然间慢了下来。“瞄准中心……”_

_Unit-01 curled its fingers onto the trigger, in unison with its Pilot. "Pull the trigger," Shinji finally spoke before he heard the loud, long blast of the rifle, emptying the entire clip into the Angel...  
零一号机与驾驶员同步，弯曲手指扣住扳机。“扣动扳机，”真嗣终于开口，紧接着便听到了步枪那响亮而持久的轰鸣，将整个弹匣的子弹尽数射向天使……_

"Shinji?"

The unexpected voice from outside the room snapped him free from that reverie. "What...?" he gasped in surprise.  
房间外突如其来的声音将他从那沉思中惊醒。“什么...？”他惊讶地倒吸一口气。

"We're going now!" Misato called out loudly.  
“我们走了！”美里大声喊道。

"Uh... Yeah! I'm coming in a second!" Shinji answered back, blinking once more before he grabbed his backpack.  
“呃... 是的！我马上进来！”真嗣回答道，再次眨了眨眼，然后抓起他的背包。

But before he left the room, he took one last look at Asuka's portrait on the desk. Taken by Hikari a month ago, it was the only picture in the room that showed the girl at her most beautiful, without a haughty smirk or those upturned eyebrows. She wore an innocent-looking smile that came with a twinkling pair of blue eyes, which made him sigh for a second.  
但在离开房间之前，他最后一次凝视了桌上那幅明日香的肖像。这幅画是一个月前由光子拍摄的，是房间里唯一一张展现了女孩最美一面的照片，没有傲慢的冷笑或那挑起的眉毛。她带着一个看起来天真无邪的微笑，一双闪烁的蓝眼睛，让他不禁叹息了一声。

_I'll be back for you_, Shinji reassured Asuka in his thoughts as he walked away.  
我会回来找你的，真嗣在心中对明日香保证，然后走开了。

With Rei watching him over, Kaworu took out the keycard for his room and inserted it into the slot, which opened the door sideways.  
在绫波的注视下，渚薰拿出他房间的钥匙卡，插入插槽，门便横向打开了。

"This is my room, you see," Kaworu remarked to the girl before they entered his miniscule quarters.  
"这就是我的房间，你看，" 渚薰对女孩说道，在他们进入他狭小的住处之前。

"I understand," Rei agreed, her eyes making notes. "It is not unusual to see such rooms to be made small."  
"我明白，" 绫波零同意道，她的眼睛在记录着。"这样的房间通常都会做得很小。

"Yes, but just wait," Kaworu answered. "It'll take a minute to find my trunks."  
"是的，但请稍等，" 渚薰回答。"需要一点时间来找我的箱子。

While Kaworu carefully rifled through his cabinet for a pair of swimming trunks, Rei glanced at his belongings, which included several books, the audio Minidisks and a violin case. At the same time, Kaworu thought of what kind of approach he had to take, the right words to say to the sullen girl, a way to make her understand his good intentions.  
当渚薰小心翼翼地从柜子里翻找泳裤时，绫波零瞥了一眼他的物品，其中包括几本书、音频迷你光盘和一个小提琴盒。与此同时，渚薰在思考该采取何种方式，用什么恰当的话语来安慰这位忧郁的女孩，如何让她理解自己的善意。

_Given the way Rei communicates, it would be as easy for me as frying an egg on a light bulb, so I must work on it very carefully.  
考虑到绫波的沟通方式，对我来说就像在灯泡上煎蛋一样简单，所以我必须非常仔细地处理。_

_However,_ Kaworu hesitated. _I still have to know why each time I touch someone. I see and feel their souls, more than what I ever imagined._  
然而，渚薰犹豫了。我仍然需要知道为什么每次我触碰某人时，我都能看到并感受到他们的灵魂，远超过我曾想象的程度。

_But again, in this world, everything can be possible.  
但在这个世界里，一切皆有可能。_

_It must be a gift.  
这一定是个礼物。_

_So I must learn how to channel this gift in such a way that it should not go out of control,_ Kaworu decided.  
因此，我必须学会如何引导这份礼物，以免它失控，碇真嗣决定。

Finally he got the midnight blue swimming trunks in his hands.  
最终，他拿到了那条深蓝色的泳裤。

"I've got it," Kaworu said as he grabbed a towel and hung it squarely on his shoulders. He turned his attention to Rei.  
"我找到了，" 渚薰说着拿起一条毛巾，端正地搭在肩上。他转向绫波。

"Pardon me, but where is the Recreation Facility?" he asked the expressionless girl.  
"打扰一下，娱乐设施在哪里？" 他向表情冷漠的女孩问道。

"At Level 8, in Block 24," Rei answered. "I will lead you there, since it is more likely you would get lost."  
"在第 8 层，24 区，" 绫波回答。"我带你去，因为你很可能会迷路。"

"I see," Kaworu nodded, before they went out of the room, heading for the bank of elevators leading down to the Facility. "Maybe the next time you might as well lead me around, isn't it right?"  
"我明白了，" 渚薰点头，随后他们走出房间，前往通往设施的电梯。"或许下次你可以直接带我四处转转，不是吗？"

Rei nodded. "That will be acceptable," she concurred.  
绫波零点头。"那样也可以，" 她同意道。

Halfway to Tokyo-2, a blue Renault Alpine A310 sports car dodged through afternoon high-speed traffic, weaving and passing on the three-lane blacktop of the expressway.  
前往第二东京的途中，一辆蓝色雷诺 Alpine A310 跑车在午后高速车流中穿梭，在高速公路的三车道上灵活穿梭并超车。

Inside the car, the two boys were desperately trying to cope with Misato's daredevil driving skills, while Pen-Pen was in the backseat, strapped in, heavily tossed side to side, yet unfazed by his mistress' driving.  
车内，两个男孩正拼命应对美里那大胆无畏的驾驶技术，而企鹅潘-潘则被固定在后座上，左右剧烈摇晃，却对女主人的驾驶毫不在意。

"I..." Shinji mumbled, grunting against the sudden lurch from one of Misato's quick, abrupt passes. "Misato... Hey...! Can't you be a little careful?" he pleaded, while Pen-Pen squawked noisily.  
"我..." 真嗣咕哝着，对抗着美里突然急转弯带来的猛烈晃动。"美里...嘿...! 你能不能稍微小心点？" 他恳求道，而潘-潘则发出嘈杂的叫声。

"You really haven't changed, am I right?" Toji cut in aloud, clenching his teeth as he resisted the lateral G-forces acting hard on him.  
“你还真是一点没变，对吧？”真嗣大声插话道，他紧咬牙关，抵抗着侧向 G 力对他的强烈作用。

Misato shook her head. "Never play it safe," she disagreed, a moderate tinge of road rage in her voice. "Considering that you have a lot of jerk-off hogs on the road to deal with... So let me smoke out this guy blocking our way!"  
美里摇了摇头。“从不求稳。”她反驳道，语气中带着一丝路怒。“考虑到路上有不少爱占道的家伙……所以让我来把挡路的家伙赶开！”

At 180 kilometers per hour and almost redlining the carefully-tweaked hybrid-system engine, Misato bopped her horn at one of the huge Hino trailer trucks trying to cut her off. The truck kept on weaving across the lanes with brief moments of space between the truck and the skid barriers for the car to overtake.  
以每小时 180 公里的速度，几乎将精心调校的混合动力引擎逼至极限，美里对着试图超车的一辆巨大的日野拖车卡车按响了喇叭。卡车继续在车道间穿梭，只在卡车与防滑护栏之间留下短暂的空隙，供汽车超车。

_Damn it,_ Misato angrily thought about the truck driver. _I think you're loaded with sake, so you want me? All right... I'll give you a pass that's too quick for you._  
该死的，美里愤怒地想着那个卡车司机。我看你是喝多了，想找我麻烦？好吧...我会让你见识一下什么叫快到你反应不过来。

Misato eyed the truck's movement, preparing her timing, until at the right moment of a clear path she crunched the transmission to the fifth gear and stomped on the gas. At the same time she jammed the steering wheel to the left.  
美里盯着卡车的动向，准备着时机，直到一条清晰的路径出现，她猛地将变速器推到第五档，一脚踩下油门。同时，她用力将方向盘向左打。

With a swift pass and screeching tires, the car went through the small gap before the truck could do anything short of smashing it hard to the skid barriers, leaving behind the offending driver to shout curses at Misato.  
随着一次迅速的超越和刺耳的轮胎摩擦声，汽车穿过卡车前的小空隙，卡车司机还没来得及做出任何反应，只能眼睁睁看着它狠狠撞向防滑护栏，而美里则留下那位恼羞成怒的司机在身后咒骂。

Misato laughed when she saw the truck flashing its headlights on the rear-view mirror, announcing its driver's outrage.  
看到后视镜里卡车闪烁的车灯，宣告着司机的愤怒，美里笑了起来。

"That serves him," she muttered afterwards in satisfaction.  
“活该，”她随后满意地低声说道。

"I'm wondering about Kaworu," Shinji spoke. "What do you think of him?"  
"我在想薰，" 真嗣说道。"你觉得他怎么样？"

"He seems to be a good guy to me, but still I'm not sure if I could trust him."  
"在我看来他似乎是个好人，但我还是不确定能否信任他。"

"Why? Something wrong with him?" Shinji wondered aloud, while Toji blinked repeatedly.  
"为什么？他有什么问题吗？" 真嗣大声地疑惑着，而东治则不停地眨眼。"

Misato concentrated her efforts at the road ahead of them. "You see, when Kaworu first arrived and I met him yesterday, what I felt about him is that he's kind of strange." She shook her head and continued. "No, not that he looks just like Rei, but there's more to him than meets the eye."  
美里集中精力在前方的道路上。"你知道，当渚薰第一次到来，我昨天见到他时，我对他的感觉是，他有点奇怪。"她摇了摇头继续说，"不，不是说他长得像丽，而是他比表面看起来要复杂得多。"

Shinji and Toji kept themselves silent, listening intently to every word she said.  
真嗣和托吉保持沉默，专心致志地听着她说的每一个字。

"The really strange was when I shook his hand," she admitted. "Have you ever done that and felt something?"  
"最奇怪的是当我握住他的手时，" 她承认道。"你有没有过那种经历，握手时感觉到什么？"

"What?" Toji gaped in wonder.  
"什么？" 冬二惊讶地张大了嘴。

Shinji blinked. "Yeah, I did," he agreed. "It felt like I accidentally bumped my elbow on something solid, and what's more, this may sound like a joke, but I also felt as if he was looking into my mind. No, it... it could be my mind playing tricks on me."  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“是的，我确实感觉到了，”他同意道，“就像我不小心用肘部撞到了什么坚硬的东西，而且，这听起来可能像是个笑话，但我还感觉他好像在窥视我的内心。不，这……可能是我的心理作用。”

"Now that's really something about our friend," Misato added. "The other thing is that he's asking a lot of questions, like he's a philosopher. That's what philosophers do – asking a lot of questions, am I right?"  
“关于我们这位朋友，这确实不简单，”美里补充道，“另外，他问了很多问题，像个哲学家似的。哲学家不就是这样的吗——问一大堆问题，我说得对吧？”

Shinji nodded mutely as he thought briefly. _Yeah, that may be right._  
真嗣默默地点了点头，短暂地思考了一下。嗯，或许是这样。

"However, there's something else we have to do right after," Misato spoke, her voice becoming somber. "We gotta buy some flowers and incense."  
"不过，我们之后还有件事必须做，" 美里说道，她的声音变得沉重。"我们得去买些花和香。"

"Why? Aren't we supposed to go home straight?" Shinji questioned as he scowled.  
“为什么？我们不是应该直接回家吗？”真嗣皱着眉头问道。

The older woman shook her head. "No... Not yet. If we could make it before sunset, we also have to pay a visit," Misato sadly decided. "We've got to make some amends."  
年长的女性摇了摇头。“不……还不行。如果能在日落前赶到，我们还得去拜访一下，”美里悲伤地决定，“我们得去弥补一些事情。”

"To whom?"

Misato sighed for a moment. "Kaji and your mother," she replied.  
美里叹了口气。“加持和你母亲，”她回答道。

None of them spoke another word afterwards, with the sense of solemnity taking up the space of the car.  
之后他们谁也没有再说一句话，庄严肃穆的气氛占据了整个车厢。

The Olympic-sized swimming pool in the Recreation Facility was deserted, save for the two Children having the entire place for themselves.  
娱乐设施中的奥林匹克标准游泳池空无一人，除了这两名少年少女独享整个场地。

"So, this is what one really gets from unlimited funding," he commented as they stood before the pool.  
"这就是无限资金带来的真正享受啊，" 他站在泳池前评论道。

Without returning a reply, Rei walked forth into the locker room.  
丽没有回应，径直走进了更衣室。

"Where is your locker?" Kaworu asked as they entered. He glanced at two separate doors, one for men and the other for women.  
"你的储物柜在哪里？" 他们进入时，渚薰问道。他瞥了一眼两扇不同的门，一扇是男更衣室，另一扇是女更衣室。

"It could be..." Rei answered, hoping she could find her locker inside. "If I could remember correctly where it can be."  
"可能是..." 丽回答道，希望自己能找到储物柜。"如果我能准确记得它在哪儿的话。"

"Yes," Kaworu agreed. "I'm sure it still has your name on," he commented before he walked into the men's locker room, while Rei went to the other room.  
"是的，" 渚薰同意道。"我相信上面还写着你的名字，" 他评论道，然后走进男更衣室，而绫波零则去了另一间。

In there and surrounded by rows of lockers, Rei began to look for her place, pointing a finger on each name labeled in plastic. There were lockers belonging to some clerks, an officer or two, several minor scientists, and two Children.  
在那一排排储物柜中，丽开始寻找自己的位置，用手指逐一指向每个贴有塑料标签的名字。这里有属于一些职员的储物柜，一两位官员的，几位初级科学家的，还有两名适格者的。

On the locker door, her name was stenciled in full, marking it right before the girl's eyes. Rei paused to find the keys in her pocket and took them out.  
在储物柜门上，她的全名被印在上面，清晰地映入女孩的眼帘。丽停下脚步，从口袋里找到钥匙并取了出来。

"Did you find it?" Kaworu called out from the other side.  
“找到了吗？”薰从另一边喊道。

"Yes," Rei spoke back, picking the right key to open the locker.  
"是的，" 丽回应道，选对了钥匙打开储物柜。

"That's better." “这样好多了。”

Rei opened her assigned locker, taking out her white one-piece swimsuit and a towel. She placed both of them on one of the benches, before the blue-haired girl then stripped herself free of her garments, methodically placing them onto the bench. Once naked, she picked off the parts of her school uniform and underwear from the bench, hung them up in the locker and closed it.  
丽打开她指定的储物柜，取出她的白色连体泳衣和一条毛巾。她将两者放在其中一个长凳上，然后蓝发女孩有条不紊地脱下自己的衣物，整齐地放在长凳上。一丝不挂后，她从长凳上拿起校服和内衣，挂进储物柜并关上门。

Taking the towel and the swimsuit, Rei walked one of the shower stalls and turned on the faucet, letting the gush of water splash down on her body.  
拿起毛巾和泳衣，丽走向一个淋浴间，打开水龙头，让水流倾泻在她身上。

_If I am in the darkness,_ she thought as rivulets of water ran down her body in the cascade, _I shall need the light to see my way through._  
如果我身处黑暗之中，她想着，水流如瀑布般顺着身体流淌，我将需要光明来指引前路。

---

Meanwhile in his shower stall, Kaworu twisted the faucet, letting out a stream of cold water from the showerhead and the liquid doused his pale body.  
与此同时，在他自己的淋浴间里，薰扭动水龙头，从花洒中喷出一股冷水，液体浇在他苍白的身躯上。

As he washed, his mind quickly flashed back to his dim memories, faint voices and blurred images:  
当他清洗时，他的思绪迅速闪回到他模糊的记忆，微弱的声音和模糊的影像：

_"The Dummy Plug System..."_

_"Ascension?" “升天？”_

_"As you wish... for the Complementation of Man..."  
“如你所愿……为了人类的互补……”_

Kaworu blinked twice, taken out of his thoughts by the words.  
渚薰眨了眨眼，被这些话从思绪中拉了出来。

_What am I thinking about?_ he wondered. _What am I really doing here for?_ Kaworu asked himself, rephrasing the question, before he shut off the flow of water, leaving him dripping with water. _Is it truly my destiny to be here? Is it to find the secret in this labyrinth?_  
我在想什么？他疑惑着。我究竟在这里做什么？渚薰重新表述问题，然后关掉了水流，水珠顺着他的身体滴落。难道我注定要在这里吗？是为了在这迷宫中寻找秘密吗？

The gray-haired boy shook his head. _No. Whatever the Committee has asked me, I have to do it._  
灰白头发的男孩摇了摇头。不。无论委员会要求我做什么，我都必须去做。

Silently he reached for his towel and buffed himself free of water droplets, and then took the swimming trunks lying on the bench and wore them, before he stepped out of the stall and walked away, only to find Rei standing by the doorframe, waiting for him.  
他默默地伸手拿起毛巾，擦干身上的水珠，然后拿起长椅上的泳裤穿上，走出隔间，却发现丽站在门框旁，正等着他。

"Oh," Kaworu spoke as he blinked. "That was fast," he remarked.  
"哦，" 渚薰眨了眨眼说道。"真快啊，" 他评论道。

"I am used to dressing up or stripping down in two minutes," Rei answered. "That is necessary when in cases of emergency combat deployment."  
"我习惯在两分钟内穿好或脱下衣服，" 绫波零回答。"在紧急战斗部署的情况下，这是必要的。

"I see," Kaworu agreed as they walked to the edge of the pool.  
“我明白了，”渚薰边说边和他们一起走到泳池边。

The boy then looked up above the bluish-white chlorinated waters of the swimming pool was the famous red NERV emblem, wedged between the national flag of Japan and the blue-and-white flag of the United Nations. The glare of the fluorescent lamps shone on the waters below, reflecting the light back onto the vaulted ceiling.  
男孩随后抬头望向游泳池上方，那蓝白相间的氯化水面上方，是著名的红色 NERV 标志，夹在日本国旗和蓝白相间的联合国旗帜之间。荧光灯的强光照射在水面上，又将光线反射到拱形天花板上。

Together, the two Children quietly slid down into the water.  
两个孩子一起静静地滑入水中。

"So, do you think that a little race would be good?" Kaworu urged as he soaked himself up to the neck.  
“那么，你觉得来个小比赛怎么样？”渚薰提议道，他整个人泡在水里，只露出脖子以上。

Rei nodded before she dove down to the depths, letting her white Spandex-covered body slice through the cold liquid.  
丽点了点头，随即潜入深渊，她那覆盖着白色氨纶的身体在冰冷的液体中划出一道轨迹。

"All right, you asked for it," Kaworu mused softly. To get things started, he kicked through the water with all of his energy, as he went after Rei.  
“好吧，这是你自找的。”渚轻声自语。为了开始这场较量，他用尽全力踢水，追逐着丽的身影。

Together they swam the entire length of the pool, as though they were racing for the 100-meter circuit. At first, Rei had the initiative to be ahead of Kaworu, but her lead dwindled as the determined young man edged closer and closer, before they made contact with the other end of the pool.  
他们一起游过了整个泳池的长度，仿佛在为 100 米赛道竞速。起初，丽领先于薰，但她的优势逐渐减弱，那位坚定的年轻人越来越接近，最终他们在泳池的另一端相遇。

Quickly they turned around to finish off the remaining 50 meters, and this time Kaworu matched Rei's cadence, until they touched the other end of the pool.  
他们迅速转身，完成剩下的 50 米，这次薰与丽的节奏同步，直到他们再次触碰到泳池的另一端。

Having accomplished the "race" exhausted, both of them surfaced and took deep breaths as they held onto the pool's edge.  
完成了这场“比赛”后，两人都筋疲力尽，浮出水面，深吸一口气，紧紧抓住泳池边缘。

While they recovered, Kaworu and Rei faced each other, with the young man the first to speak up.  
在他们恢复期间，渚薰和丽面对面站着，年轻人率先开口。

"Well... you're good... a pretty good swimmer... I never knew that... that you can swim as fast as I do," Kaworu praised between gasps of air.  
“嗯……你很厉害……游泳游得很好……我之前都不知道……你能游得和我一样快。”渚薰喘着气称赞道。

Still bobbing in the water, Rei nodded silently before swimming to the ladder and hauled herself up. She walked to where Kaworu was near and sat down at the edge, dipping her legs into the water before she glanced at the young man's eyes.  
仍然在水面上漂浮着，绫波零默默地点了点头，然后游向梯子，爬了上去。她走到渚薰附近，坐在边缘，将双腿浸入水中，然后瞥了一眼年轻人的眼睛。

She certainly read him well. _You wanted to help me?_  
她确实很了解他。你想帮我吗？

As if he heard the words in her mind, Kaworu answered. "I want to help you... because I feel you have problems, and they need to be solved."  
仿佛听到了她心中的话语，渚薰回答道：“我想帮助你……因为我感觉到你有困扰，它们需要被解决。”

Grabbing the lipped edge of the pool, Kaworu pulled himself out of the water and sat a foot away from Rei.  
抓住泳池边缘，渚薰将自己从水中拉出，坐在离绫波一英尺远的地方。

"You remind me of Shinji... except there's a difference between him and you..." he spoke as he shook himself free of water droplets.  
“你让我想起了真嗣……只是你们之间有所不同……”他一边说，一边抖落身上的水珠。

Kaworu paused for a second, before he delivered the ultimate first question. "So, if you can open your heart... what is the problem that's disturbing you, Rei Ayanami?"  
渚薰停顿了一下，然后提出了那个终极的第一个问题。“那么，如果你能敞开心扉……困扰你的是什么问题呢，绫波零？”

That unexpected question startled her. "Pardon me?" she asked.  
这个出乎意料的问题让她吃了一惊。“你说什么？”她问道。

Kaworu never let his gaze waver. "You do have a problem... You are troubled and I can see it in your eyes," he repeated softly.  
渚薰的目光从未动摇。“你的确有困扰……你心烦意乱，我能从你的眼中看出来，”他轻声重复道。

For a silent moment they stared at each other.  
他们沉默地对视了一会儿。

"I could not remember," she finally admitted, breaking the stillness as the rivulets of water slowly dripped down upon her body.  
“我记不起来了，”她终于承认，打破了寂静，水流缓缓滴落在她的身上。

"Why?" Kaworu questioned. "Is it because of the explosion days before?"  
"为什么？" 薰问道。"是因为前几天的大爆炸吗？"

Rei gently nodded. "It could be... as I could not remember the exact circumstances of that sortie, except that I was in the Infirmary and that is all I can recall," she confessed.  
丽轻轻点头。“可能是……因为我记不清那次出击的具体情况了，只记得自己在医务室，其他的都想不起来，”她坦白道。

"I see," Kaworu agreed. "You can go on and I'm with you."  
“我明白了，”渚薰同意道。“你可以继续说，我在这里陪着你。”

"I have spent the same day in that room, wondering I could not remember, until Shinji visited me later on," Rei said, before she began to tell about the first time they saw each other after the sortie:  
"我在那个房间里度过了同样的一天，疑惑着自己为何记不起来，直到真嗣后来探望我，" 绫波说，随后开始讲述他们第一次在出击后相见时的情景：

"_You saved me... so I bothered myself to thank you. I owe you a lot for doing the right thing!" Shinji happily exclaimed as he burst into the room, carefully shutting the door and the world behind him._  
"你救了我... 所以我特意来感谢你。你做得很对，我欠你很多！" 真嗣开心地喊着，冲进房间，小心翼翼地关上门，也将外面的世界隔绝在外。

_On the bed and propped by pillows behind her back, Rei blinked softly. "Did I save you?" she asked.  
绫波靠在床头的枕头上，轻轻眨了眨眼。"我救了你吗？" 她问道。_

_Shinji nodded as he put down a wrapped bento box onto the bedside table for her vegetarian lunch. "Yeah. Don't you remember what happened down there? I saw you fight and kill that Angel."  
真嗣点点头，将一个包装好的便当盒放在床头柜上，供她享用素食午餐。“嗯。你不记得下面发生的事了吗？我看到你与那个使徒战斗并将其击杀。”_

_But Rei shook her head. "No... I mean... I do not remember about that... I think... I am probably the Third."  
但丽摇了摇头。"不...我的意思是...我不记得那件事了...我想...我大概就是第三适格者。"_

"What do you mean that you're the Third?" Kaworu wondered.  
"你说的第三适格者是什么意思？" 渚薰疑惑地问。"

Rei looked away. "I do not know why I said that on that day, but I felt as if I was alone all by myself."  
丽移开了视线。"我不知道那天为什么那么说，但我感觉自己仿佛孤身一人。"

"Alone?" Kaworu asked, curious to know what else lay beneath the girl's face.  
“独自一人？”薰问道，好奇女孩的内心还隐藏着什么。

But Rei disagreed, shaking her head. "I am alone. That is all I could answer."  
但丽摇了摇头，表示不同意。“我独自一人。这就是我能给出的全部回答。”

_I see,_ Kaworu thought as he smiled softly. _Perhaps I'll ask something else easier for you_, he decided_. We're just starting right now._  
我明白了，渚薰心想，他温柔地微笑着。或许我会问些更容易的问题，他决定。我们才刚刚开始。

"Well, I'll tell you something else. Do you remember about our first meeting at the Commander's office?" Kaworu recalled, changing the subject.  
"好吧，我再告诉你一件事。你还记得我们在指挥官办公室的第一次见面吗？" 渚薰换了个话题，回忆道。

"Yes," Rei confirmed. "I am aware of our first encounter."  
"是的，" 绫波确认道。"我记得我们第一次相遇的情景。"

"Tell me, how did you feel when you first saw me?" Kaworu asked, but he saw Rei hesitate, the girl blinking softly, trying to sort her feelings. "It's just a matter between both of us," he reassured.  
"告诉我，你第一次见到我时是什么感觉？" 渚薰问道，但他看到绫波有些犹豫，女孩轻轻眨眼，试图整理自己的感受。"这只是我们之间的事，" 他安慰道。

"I... I was... surprised that you were just like me," Rei admitted with difficulty.  
“我……我感到……惊讶，你竟然和我如此相似，”绫波丽艰难地承认。

"Ah," Kaworu sighed. "When I saw you for the first time, I was startled by your likeness as well, except that there is something delicate about you. I feel that your heart is just as fragile as Shinji."  
“啊，”渚薰叹息道，“当我第一次见到你时，我也被你的相似之处吓了一跳，只是你身上有种脆弱的气质。我觉得你的心和真嗣一样脆弱。”

"Is that true?" Rei questioned softly. "Why?"  
"那是真的吗？" 丽轻声问道。"为什么？"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, of course. I have seen the sadness in your eyes and beneath your emotionless façade, as those eyes can show feelings that couldn't be masked."  
薰点头。"是的，当然。我看到了你眼中的悲伤，以及你无表情外表下的情感，那些眼睛能流露出无法掩饰的情感。"

Rei quietly blinked. "Tears," she whispered softly, barely audible to Kaworu's ears.  
丽静静地眨了眨眼。"泪水，"她轻声细语，几乎听不见薰的耳朵。

"Tears?"

"Yes... tears..." Rei confessed. "I was crying on the day I was in the Infirmary... crying for no reason at all... except I felt that it was not the first time I had cried."  
"是的...眼泪..." 丽坦白道。"我在医务室的那天哭了...无缘无故地哭泣...只是我觉得那不是我第一次流泪。"

"So, if it's the tears, then it can be your pain," Kaworu figured. _I know that people will cry out of pain, of joy, of fear or anger, but most will cry when they get hurt within._  
"所以，如果是眼泪，那就可以是你的痛苦，" 渚薰推测道。"我知道人们会因为痛苦、喜悦、恐惧或愤怒而哭泣，但大多数人在内心受伤时也会哭泣。"

Rei lightly nodded in agreement. "You... You could be right... Tears are pain."  
丽轻轻点头表示同意。“你……你说得对……泪水是痛苦的象征。”

"Rei," Kaworu spoke.

"What... what do you wish?" the girl responded softly.  
“你……你希望什么？”女孩轻声回应。

Kaworu pursed his lips and sighed, and told her of his resolve. "I just wanted to do something." He cleared his throat. "If you could trust me, if you could open your heart, would you allow me to help?"  
薰抿紧嘴唇，叹了口气，向她诉说了自己的决心。“我只是想做点什么。”他清了清喉咙。“如果你能信任我，如果你能敞开心扉，你愿意让我帮忙吗？”

This time, Rei looked up and stared into Kaworu's sympathetic eyes, realizing that it was time to do the right thing... for the sake of her soul and her existence. There was no greater pain and loss than to have that terrible feeling of incompleteness within her heart.  
这一次，绫波零抬起头，凝视着渚薰充满同情的眼睛，意识到是时候做正确的事了……为了她的灵魂和存在。没有什么比心中那种可怕的不完整感更痛苦和失落的了。

"Yes, please help me," Rei finally pleaded.  
"是的，请帮帮我，" 丽终于恳求道。"

In the course of their long journey, the two boys at the backseat had fallen asleep. Toji smacked his lips in his slumber.  
在漫长的旅途中，后排的两个男孩不知不觉间睡着了。真嗣在睡梦中咂了咂嘴。

As for Shinji, he dreamt of the night he kissed Asuka.  
至于真嗣，他梦见了那个他亲吻明日香的夜晚。

In that dream Shinji could vividly gaze at the girl standing before him in her typical at-home outfit: a loose yellow t-shirt and a pair of powder-blue shorts, showcasing her long svelte legs. The girl's red hair also hung loose and, probably for the first time, Asuka gave him a relaxed face, like she was ready to do something untypical for the evening.  
在梦中，真嗣清晰地看到了站在他面前的女孩，她穿着典型的家居服：一件宽松的黄色 T 恤和一条粉蓝色的短裤，展现出她修长匀称的双腿。女孩的红发也随意披散着，或许是第一次，明日香给了他一个放松的表情，仿佛准备在那个晚上做些不同寻常的事情。

"_Hey, Shinji, let's kiss," Asuka suggested._  
“嘿，真嗣，我们接吻吧，”明日香提议道。

_She felt it was getting late. Misato and Ryoji seemed to be taking too long outside, but she guessed that they could probably get home by next morning.  
她觉得时间不早了。美里和六分仪似乎在外面待得太久了，但她猜他们大概能在第二天早上回家。_

_The young boy was instantly taken aback by her offer, blinking. "Eh..? What?"  
少年被她的提议吓了一跳，眨了眨眼。“诶..？什么？”_

_Asuka cocked an eye at him. "Darned wuss, I said we kiss," she repeated. "Kiss, you goof. You've never done that, right?"  
明日香斜眼看着他。“胆小鬼，我说了我们该接吻，”她重复道。“接吻，你这个傻瓜。你从来没做过，对吧？”_

_Shinji shook his head as the blush began to creep onto his cheeks. "No... Well... er, I... I never did that before."  
真嗣摇了摇头，脸颊开始泛红。“不……呃，我……我以前从没做过。”_

_The girl smiled back. "Then, let's kiss. Come on."  
女孩回以微笑。“那么，我们来个吻吧。来吧。”_

_Shinji still looked perplexed. "Why?"  
真嗣看起来仍然困惑。“为什么？”_

_The girl shrugged and admitted, "Because I don't have anything else to do. I'm bloody bored."  
女孩耸了耸肩，坦白道：“因为我没有其他事情可做。我真是无聊透顶。”_

_The young man frowned, still blushing. "You're that bored, and you want me to kiss? Isn't it a bit too much?"  
年轻人皱起眉头，脸依旧红着。“你这么无聊，就想要我吻你？是不是有点太过分了？”_

_Asuka laughed loudly, seeing how flustered Shinji was. "You don't want to kiss a girl on the anniversary of your mama's death, right?" she questioned mockingly. "Are you afraid that your mama might be watching us from heaven? Strike you with a thunderbolt?"  
明日香大声笑了起来，看着真嗣那慌张的样子。“你不想在妈妈忌日这天亲吻一个女孩，对吧？”她嘲弄地问道。“你是不是怕你妈妈从天堂看着我们？会用雷劈你？”_

"_N... Not really," he disagreed nervously. "It's... uh..." he stammered._  
“不……不是那样，”他紧张地反驳道。“只是……呃……”他结巴着。

_Asuka inched close to Shinji and whispered right into his face. "Or... are you simply afraid of me?" she softly badgered, letting her voice wrap around his heart. The boy could also see her eyes mocking at him as his pulse rate went up in proportion to his nervousness.  
明日香慢慢靠近真嗣，对着他的脸轻声细语。“还是……你只是怕我？”她温柔地挑衅，让声音缠绕在他的心上。男孩也能看到她的眼睛在嘲笑他，他的心跳随着紧张感成比例地加速。_

_Shinji blinked. "Hey, I'm not... I... I'll kiss you."  
"真嗣眨了眨眼。“嘿，我不是……我……我会吻你的。””_

_But Asuka wagged a finger at him. "Have you brushed your teeth?" she sternly warned.  
"但明日香朝他摇了摇手指。“你刷牙了吗？”她严厉地警告道。”_

_Shinji blinked. "Um... y... yeah," he apprehensively replied.  
"真嗣眨了眨眼。“嗯……刷……刷了，”他不安地回答。”_

_But before the boy could make his move, Asuka pinched her nose and let her lips touch with his. The girl hoped that he wouldn't goof off his one best chance by a single mistake.  
但在男孩行动之前，明日香捏住自己的鼻子，让双唇与他相触。女孩希望他不会因为一个小错误而错失这唯一的好机会。_

_Yes, Shinji had brushed his teeth, redolent with the toothpaste-freshened taste of his mouth... but this... kissing was an entirely new sensation for him, sending all his senses into overdrive.  
是的，真嗣刷了牙，嘴里还留着牙膏的清新味道……但这……接吻对他来说是一种全新的感觉，让他的所有感官都进入了超负荷状态。_

_Her lips were soft, moist and he could also taste the delicious remains of Asuka's chocolate Pocky... while her tongue began to explore around, probing his teeth and tongue, asking him to do the same thing.  
她的唇柔软湿润，他还能尝到明日香巧克力百奇的美味残留...当她的舌头开始四处探索，触碰他的牙齿和舌头，示意他也同样回应时。_

_With that heated persuasion, Shinji suddenly thought of imitating the kisses on TV... specifically the most torrid ones on prime-time soap operas. So Shinji tried his best to do it right... even if he didn't look like those matinee idols.  
在这种热烈的引导下，真嗣突然想模仿电视上的吻...特别是黄金时段肥皂剧中那些最炽热的吻。于是真嗣尽力做到最好...尽管他看起来并不像那些银幕偶像。_

_Only trouble was, he was breathing through his nose, causing Asuka to let go for a while and frown.  
唯一的问题是，他正通过鼻子呼吸，这让明日香暂时松开并皱起了眉头。_

"_Don't breathe!" she admonished. "Your breath is tickling me."_  
"别呼吸！" 她告诫道。"你的呼吸在挠我痒痒。"

_And once more they went back, kissing again as Asuka tested Shinji's capacity for romance, seeing how far he would go as a boy... or hopefully a man like super-adorable Ryoji Kaji.  
他们再次回到原处，再次亲吻，阿斯卡测试真嗣的浪漫能力，看他能走多远，作为一个男孩……或者希望成为一个像超级可爱的加持良治那样的男人。_

_However... something went wrong, even with the best of his efforts. It was beyond his control.  
然而……尽管他尽了最大努力，还是出了差错。这超出了他的控制。_

Awakened, Shinji blinked as he tried to get to his senses... and found Pen-Pen's beak a wee bit too close to the lips. He could also smell the bird's breath, a lingering stench of lunchtime sardines.  
醒来时，真嗣眨了眨眼，试图恢复意识……却发现 Pen-Pen 的喙离自己的嘴唇太近了。他还能闻到鸟儿的呼吸，一股午餐时沙丁鱼的余味。

"AARRRGGHH!" Shinji yelled out, jumping from his seat as he shooed the bird away from him. Pen-Pen scrambled for the safety of the front seat and of his mistress' proximity.  
“啊——！”真嗣大叫一声，从座位上跳起来，把鸟儿赶开。Pen-Pen 慌忙逃到前排座位，靠近女主人的安全地带。

At the same time, Misato's attention was instantly drawn away from the steering wheel, prompting the Renault to weave the road for a moment. The woman yanked the car back to its proper lane, nearly grinding it on the side of a speeding bus.  
与此同时，美里立刻从方向盘上分了心，导致雷诺车在路上摇摆了一下。她猛地将车拉回正确车道，差点擦到旁边一辆疾驰的公交车。

Toji was instantly roused from his short-skirt-fueled slumber. "Buddy, what the hell's going on?" he demanded loudly as he watched his friend repeatedly spit downward.  
真嗣立刻从他那短裙引发的睡梦中惊醒。“伙计，到底怎么回事？”他大声质问，同时看着他的朋友不停地向下吐口水。

"Shinji!" Misato hollered, having regained control of the steering wheel. "What's wrong back there? Got a nightmare? Gosh! You gave me such a surprise!"  
“真嗣！”美里大喊，已经重新控制住了方向盘。“后面怎么了？做噩梦了吗？天哪！你吓到我了！”

The shocked young man blinked repeatedly, an attempt to bring his senses back to the real world. "N... No... Sorry..." he mumbled, swallowing hard and breathing rapidly. "G... God... Where I did go wrong?" he wondered aloud.  
震惊的年轻人反复眨眼，试图让他的感官回到现实世界。“不……不……对不起……”他咕哝着，艰难地吞咽并急促呼吸。“天……天哪……我到底哪里做错了？”他自言自语道。

"Say what?" Toji questioned.  
“你说什么？”冬二疑惑地问。

Shinji turned his attention to his friend. "I... I blew my chance..." he answered.  
真嗣转向他的朋友。“我……我搞砸了机会……”他回答道。

Toji scowled. "What chance? I mean, what the hell are you talking about?"  
剑介皱眉。“什么机会？我是说，你到底在说什么鬼？”

"I'm sorry," Shinji apologized quietly. "I should've told you about this, many nights ago I..." he added, but stammered.  
“对不起，”真嗣轻声道歉。“我早该告诉你的，很多个夜晚以前我就……”他补充道，但结巴了。

The hesitation only served to perplex Toji. "What? Come on, spit it out. Whisper it if you can."  
犹豫不决反而让冬二更加困惑。“什么？快说，有话直说。小声点也行。”

"I kissed Asuka," Shinji divulged quietly.

Toji gaped in amazement for a second. "You...." he mumbled, "Isn't it a damned miracle that he..." A small smile formed onto his lips and then he snickered.  
冬二目瞪口呆了一会儿。“你……”他喃喃道，“这不是天大的奇迹吗……”一丝微笑浮现在他嘴角，随即他轻声笑了起来。

"What's so funny about that?" the Third Children retorted, a scowl crossing his face.  
“这有什么好笑的？”第三适格者反驳道，脸上掠过一丝不悦。

"Damn you! You kissed the girl!" Toji awed. "Oh, boy, that's wonderful! Why didn't you tell me about it?"  
"该死！你亲了那个女孩！" 真嗣惊叹道。"哦，天哪，太棒了！你怎么没告诉我？"

Shinji was already beet-red in the face. "All right... I did it, yes I did it," he regretfully admitted. "But... I kissed Asuka because... because..."  
真嗣的脸已经红得像甜菜一样。"好吧...我做了，是的，我做了，"他懊悔地承认。"但是...我亲了明日香是因为...因为..."

"You kissed her because of what?" Toji inquired with keen interest. "Gimme an explanation, pal."  
"你亲她是因为什么？" 真嗣好奇地追问。"给我个解释，伙计。"

"Bored," Shinji responded. "She was bored... Well... she couldn't wait for Misato and Kaji to come home so..."  
"无聊，" 真嗣回答道。"她觉得无聊...嗯...她等不及美里和加持回家，所以..."

"That's it?"

Shinji shook his head. "I don't know exactly why... but I feel that she was... Maybe she was just like that or she was testing me... You know how those girls from Germany are..." he mumbled, trying to get the right word to describe.  
真嗣摇了摇头。"我不确定为什么...但我感觉她可能是...也许她就是那样，或者她在考验我...你知道那些德国女孩的..." 他咕哝着，试图找到合适的词来形容。

"As in 'liberated'?" Toji spoke, supplying the correct word.  
"你是说'解放'吗？" 东治插话道，给出了正确的词。

Embarrassed, Shinji nodded. "Yeah," he confirmed, before he began to explain the rest about that night as Pen-Pen plopped onto his lap and preened. "I... As I kissed her, I was afraid that she'll beat me to a pulp if I faltered. Unfortunately... I thought... she thought I fumbled and pushed me away, yelled at me for kissing in the wrong way..."  
感到尴尬的碇真嗣点了点头。“是的，”他确认道，然后开始解释那晚的其余事情，同时企鹅潘-潘跳到他的腿上整理羽毛。“我……当我吻她时，我担心如果我犹豫，她会把我揍得鼻青脸肿。不幸的是……我想……她以为我笨拙地吻了她，然后推开我，对我吻得不对大喊大叫……”

Toji cocked an eye at his friend. "You said it's a test, right?"  
冬二挑起一只眼睛看着朋友。“你说这是个测试，对吧？”

Shinji nodded silently.

"Okay," Toji agreed. "She kissed you because she wanted to see if you were really a man... The way I see it, she must be finding the right guy for her. So tell me, did she ever tell you any of her other dates or boyfriends?"  
“好吧，”冬二同意道，“她吻你是因为想看看你是不是真男人……依我看，她肯定是在找合适的人选。所以告诉我，她有没有跟你提过她的其他约会对象或男朋友？”

In a flash, Shinji remembered what Asuka had said about the other boy – a medical student to be exact – she left behind at the amusement park.  
一瞬间，真嗣想起了明日香提到的那个男孩——准确地说，是一名医学院学生——她留在游乐园的那个人。

"_That boy's sooo boring," Asuka complained. "So I bailed out, getting away from that nerdy dumb-ass while we were standing in line for the rollercoaster."_  
“那个男孩超级无聊，”明日香抱怨道，“所以我趁我们在排队玩过山车的时候，甩掉了那个书呆子蠢货。”

_Shinji frowned. "You cold-shouldered that guy?"  
真嗣皱起眉头。“你冷落了那个人？”_

"_Yeah, he's a turn-off prattling bore, and he's not like a real man like Kaji!"_  
“是啊，他是个喋喋不休的无聊鬼，根本不像真嗣那样的真男人！”

"Well, yeah... I remember," Shinji answered quietly, not too loud for Misato to overhear and close enough to Toji's ear. "She also told me that Kaji was her man, um, from the way she thinks. I think she was comparing any of her dull dates with Kaji. The truth is, her standards are way too high."  
“嗯，是的……我记得，”真嗣轻声回答，不让美里听到，声音也足够让冬二听见。“她还告诉我，真嗣是她心目中的男人。我想她是在拿那些无聊的约会对象和真嗣比较。事实上，她的标准太高了。”

Toji shook his head. "In that case," he spoke, "I would say that out of the several million older guys Asuka tried to date with. I think that you may be her Mister Right."  
冬二摇了摇头。“这样的话，”他说，“我想在明日香尝试约会的几百万个男人中，你可能是她的真命天子。”

Shinji blinked. "What? I still don't know if she really likes me or not!"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“什么？我还是不知道她是不是真的喜欢我！”

Toji cackled loudly, before he continued explaining. "Think about this, my friend: who's the first man she sees when she wakes up in the morning, yelling out for breakfast?" he asked. "You, right?"  
剑介大声笑了起来，然后继续解释道：“想想看，朋友：每天早上她醒来时，第一个看到的人是谁，喊着要吃早餐？”他问道。“是你，对吧？”

"Yeah," Shinji answered. "I do cook her breakfast. Bacon, ham, eggs and toast to be exact."  
“嗯，”真嗣回答，“我确实给她做早餐。确切地说，是培根、火腿、鸡蛋和吐司。”

"Now, who's the first man Asuka tugs along with whenever she goes to school? It's you, am I correct?"  
"现在，每次明日香去学校时，第一个被她拽着的人是谁？是你，对吧？"

"Uh-huh... I get your drift."  
"嗯哼...我明白你的意思了。"

Toji cleared his throat. "And in the matter of your weekly laundry duties," he went on, "from what I guess... Who's the first and the only man to... handle her dirty bras and panties in the hamper?" he jested, before the Osakan laughed out loudly, almost doubling over.  
剑介清了清嗓子。“至于你每周的洗衣任务，”他继续说道，“据我猜测...谁是第一个也是唯一一个...处理她脏内衣裤的人？”他打趣道，随后大阪人放声大笑，几乎笑弯了腰。

"Yeah, it's me," Shinji scowled back, blush creeping onto his face. "But damn you, Suzuhara... I'M NOT THAT PERVERTED!"  
"是啊，是我。" 真嗣皱着眉头回道，脸颊上泛起红晕。"但该死的铃原...我才不是那种变态！"

"That's the point!" Toji answered back after he guffawed. "I know that you and I aren't closet 'service' maniacs, and I know that most of the time Asuka gets you fried right in front of me, Kensuke and Hikari."  
"这就是重点！" 当东治大笑后回答道。"我知道你和我都不是那种躲在柜子里的'服务'狂热者，而且我知道大多数时候，明日香让你在我、健介和光面前出糗。"

"All right," the other boy groaned.  
"好吧，" 另一个男孩呻吟道。"

"However," Toji continued, "she could be outgrowing her infatuation with older guys, looking for someone like you, which means that once Asuka wakes up from that coma. The first thing you should do is, as you've said earlier... is to talk to her." _I'm also damn sure that she'll wake up, so trust me,_ Toji confidently added in his thoughts.  
"然而，" 冬二继续说道，"她可能正在超越对年长男性的迷恋，寻找像你这样的人，这意味着一旦明日香从昏迷中醒来。你应该做的第一件事，正如你之前所说的... 就是和她谈谈。" 我也非常确信她会醒来，所以相信我，冬二自信地在心中补充道。

Shinji nodded. "I know," he agreed, "but that could be hard."  
真嗣点点头。"我知道，" 他同意道，"但这可能很难。"

"What you should say to Asuka," Toji continued, "is that you must explain why you are stuck with her, admit that you're the only man she could talk to and walk to school with... and then you return her kiss."  
"你应该对明日香说的话，" 冬二继续说道，"是你必须解释为什么你和她纠缠不清，承认你是唯一能和她交谈并一起上学的人... 然后你回吻她。"

"She'd kill me if I did it again!" Shinji objected, very sure that the next one could be a punch to his jaw.  
“如果我再这么做，她会杀了我的！” 真嗣反对道，非常确定下一次可能会是一拳打在他的下巴上。

"So what if Asuka's too difficult for your guts?" Toji responded, giving Shinji the look of a drill sergeant. "Once she wakes up, the first thing she'll do is to change her mind. She'll also feel guilty for doing the bad crap heaped upon you ever since she first came here. And if she finally asks for your forgiveness, tell her that both of you have a common reason to be together despite your differences. True, she may hate you for not having a spine or even the balls to go forth, but deep inside she's looking for that special someone."  
“就算明日香对你来说太难对付了又怎样？” 冬二回应道，给了真嗣一个像教官一样的眼神。“一旦她醒来，她首先会改变主意。她也会为自己自从来到这里后对你做的那些糟糕事感到内疚。如果她最终请求你的原谅，告诉她，尽管你们有分歧，但你们有一个共同的理由在一起。确实，她可能会因为你没有骨气甚至没有勇气前进而恨你，但在内心深处，她在寻找那个特别的人。”

Shinji sighed and gulped hard. "I still need the right words... but..." he mumbled.  
真嗣叹了口气，艰难地咽了咽口水。“我还是需要合适的词……但是……”他喃喃自语。

"To hell with your fumbling," Toji disagreed, wishing to correct his friend's doubts. "Just kiss Asuka again to show that you're a big man now," he dared. "Kiss her because she's a loser just like you, and kiss her because there's no other man for her to turn to when the odds are stacked against her. That's one good way to show that you can still kick some ass!" At the last word Toji punched the air with his only fist.  
"去你的笨手笨脚，" 真嗣不同意，希望能纠正朋友的疑虑。"再吻明日香一次，证明你现在是个男子汉了，" 他挑衅道。"吻她，因为她和你一样是个失败者，吻她，因为在她处于劣势时没有其他男人可以依靠。这是证明你还能有所作为的好方法！" 说到最后一个词时，真嗣用他仅剩的一只拳头击向空中。

The young man had nothing else to answer, preferring to think hard about it for a moment.  
年轻人无言以对，宁愿深思片刻。

"You've kept your word that you're still my friend even if I'm a bloody half-cripple because of Unit-01," Toji recalled, before he raised his remaining hand, as though he was preparing for an oath. "Now, swear to me that you'll do the impossible. Just say it," he dared.  
"你遵守了诺言，即使我因为零号机变成了半个残废，你依然是我的朋友，" 真嗣回忆道，然后举起他剩下的那只手，仿佛准备宣誓。"现在，向我发誓你会做不可能的事。就说出来，" 他挑衅道。

In response, Shinji raised his right hand to show that he had the resolve. "I swear... I will," he stuttered hesitantly at first, but straightened himself out immediately. "I will kiss... and talk to Asuka Langley Souryu once she wakes up."  
作为回应，真嗣举起右手，表明自己已有决心。“我发誓……我会，”他一开始结巴着犹豫不决，但立刻挺直了身子。“我会亲吻……并在惣流·明日香·兰格雷醒来后与她交谈。”

Toji triumphantly laughed out loud. "That's right! Do the right thing, my buddy!"  
剑介得意地大声笑了出来。“没错！做正确的事，我的好兄弟！”

Shinji sighed in relief as he nodded. "Yeah... I'll do it."  
真嗣松了口气，点头道：“嗯……我会去做的。”

Back at the swimming pool in the Geofront, Kaworu lounged by the poolside and watched Rei swimming in the water alone.  
回到地底都市的游泳池边，渚薰懒洋洋地靠在池畔，注视着绫波丽独自在水中游泳。

As he observed the delicate-looking young woman, Kaworu spoke in his thoughts.  
当他观察着那位看似柔弱的年轻女子时，渚薰在心中默语。

_I feel that she still has yet to know the meaning of her life... she looks unformed, in need of spiritual growth and warmth... Like a flower bud struggling to blossom in the darkness, Rei needs the light... for nothing can live with nothing and the predictability of her life can be as cruel as a machine.  
我感觉她仍未领悟生命的意义...她显得未成形，需要精神上的成长与温暖...就像一朵在黑暗中挣扎绽放的花蕾，绫需要光明...因为没有任何生物能在无物与可预知的生活中生存，这种生活可能像机器一样残酷。_

_She's truly fragile as I ever seen...  
她的确是我见过的最脆弱的..._

_But, from the look on her face, she has faced the hardest times of her life, fighting back the tears. Rei bore the weight of all her fears, the sorrow within her heart, which she only knows.  
但，从她脸上的神情来看，她已历经生命中最艰难的时刻，强忍泪水。丽背负着所有恐惧的重担，心中的悲伤，唯有她自己知晓。_

Kaworu sighed. _I've seen in her eyes... Yes, she's suffering, paying for a heavy debt she never owed. For someone like her, I think that the only freedom she knows is whenever she sleeps._  
薰叹了口气。我在她的眼中看到了...是的，她在受苦，偿还一笔她从未欠下的沉重债务。对于她这样的人来说，我想她唯一能感受到的自由，只有在她入睡的时候。

_She could be searching for the truth about herself... or the tiny spark of humanity that's in her heart, looking for the real Rei within.  
她或许在寻找关于自己的真相...或是内心深处那一丝人性的火花，探寻真正的丽。_

Kaworu's thoughts slowly focused onto the Commander, figuring out what was ticking within that ice-cold veneer of the elder Ikari, the older man hunched behind his desk, the way the Commander's shielded eyes stared at them yesterday. The draconian lord of the manor seemed to disapprove weakness in any way he perceived in his subordinates' eyes or faces.  
渚薰的思绪渐渐集中在司令官身上，试图揣摩那位冷若冰霜的碇元渡内心究竟在盘算什么，那位年长的男人蜷缩在他的办公桌后，昨日司令官那双遮掩的眼睛是如何凝视他们的。这位庄园的严厉主宰似乎对下属眼中或脸上的任何软弱迹象都持否定态度。

His thoughts were also accompanied by flashbacks of seeing Asuka in the hospital bed, staring towards the unseen sky; the hopeless sorrow marked in Shinji's face, and the pleading in Rei's red eyes, desperate for an answer.  
他的思绪还伴随着在医院病床上看到明日香凝视着看不见的天空的闪回；真嗣脸上绝望的悲伤，以及绫波零红色眼眸中恳求答案的迫切。

_I wonder... yes, I wonder if the Commander ever has any conscience regarding my fellow Children.  
我在想……是的，我在想司令官是否对我这些同伴有过一丝良知。_

_Where is his conscience?_ Kaworu pondered, but he realized that the bearded man in the ivory tower had erased his guilt complexes a long time ago. _The Commander... in my eyes,_ Kaworu shook his head. _He's a man beyond reproach, believing in his own ideas and visions as infallible against any other objections..._  
他的良心何在？渚薰思索着，但他意识到那位住在象牙塔里的络腮胡男子早已抹去了自己的罪恶感。司令官……在我眼中，渚薰摇了摇头。他是一个无可指摘的人，坚信自己的理念和愿景是无可辩驳的……

_Such considerable power invested in a single Lilim,_ he concluded.  
如此巨大的权力集中在一个莉莉姆身上，他得出结论。

Instead of pondering on about the Committee's orders, Kaworu turned his attention to the albino girl swimming in the water.  
卡沃鲁并未深思委员会的命令，而是将注意力转向了水中游泳的白化病女孩。

"Rei," Kaworu called out.  
“绫波，”渚薰呼唤道。

The girl stopped and floated in the middle of the pool. "Yes?"  
女孩停下，漂浮在泳池中央。“什么事？”

"I just thought if we could spare ourselves a snack afterwards," Kaworu offered. "Maybe you would like to."  
"我只是想，如果我们之后能吃点零食，" 渚薰提议道。"或许你会喜欢。"

Still bobbing in the water, Rei thought of the offer. _It is a simply harmless activity and very acceptable to the Commander._  
依旧在水面上漂浮着，绫波想了想这个提议。这是一项简单无害的活动，并且很符合司令官的接受标准。

"Yes," Rei agreed as she swam to his direction. "I accept your invitation... and perhaps we could talk."  
"好的，" 绫波一边向他的方向游去一边同意道。"我接受你的邀请... 或许我们可以聊聊。"

"That'll be better," Kaworu agreed, but he wondered what she ate at snack time. _A sandwich?_ He pondered. _Rice cakes? Soda crackers?_  
“那样会更好，”渚薰同意道，但他想知道她在零食时间吃了什么。三明治？他思索着。米饼？苏打饼干？

_No, I'll let Rei have her way instead... After all, we have a long way to get along.  
不，我会让绫波按她的方式来……毕竟，我们还有很长的路要相处。_

Within the Infirmary's disinfectant-tinged corridors, Doctor Natsumi Odani felt glum each time she walked past the door to Asuka's room, ever since Section Two agents had found the girl in the abandoned village, languishing in a bathtub and bleeding to death.  
在医务室弥漫着消毒水气味的走廊里，每当走过明日香房间的门口，医生绪方奈津美总是感到一阵忧郁。自从第二支部特工在废弃村庄发现她时，她正躺在浴缸里，奄奄一息地流血。

The young Internal Department doctor stopped in her tracks, and she gazed at the unconscious Second Children from behind the plate glass window. As she stood there, Odani recalled more of what followed that near-suicide attempt.  
年轻的内务部医生停下脚步，透过平板玻璃窗凝视着昏迷中的第二适格者。站在那里，奈津美回想起那次近乎自杀的尝试后发生的事情。

The unfortunate departure of Ritsuko Akagi had left Odani with the major burden of treating Asuka in the emergency room, rushed to stop the bleeding and finally sewed up the cut. After the minor operation, however, Odani had been sternly ordered by the Commander to put the girl under heavy sedation, instead of the standard procedure of nursing Asuka back to health.  
由于赤木律子的不幸离去，奈津美承担起了在急诊室救治明日香的重任，紧急止血并最终缝合了伤口。然而，在完成小手术后，奈津美却被司令严厉命令对女孩进行深度镇静，而非按照常规程序让她恢复健康。

Knowing of the Commander's draconian reputation in the organization, and against her conscience, Odani was finally obliged to follow his command.  
深知指挥官在组织中严苛的名声，尽管违背自己的良心，Odani 最终还是不得不服从他的命令。

The thought of Commander Ikari's order now made her recall of what she and her surgery team would be doing tonight, and of the secret briefing she had received from the Big Man three days before. She also noted how he had outlined the surgery as if he eagerly anticipated the moment.  
想到碇司令的命令，她不禁回想起今晚她和手术团队将要执行的任务，以及三天前从那位大人物那里接受的秘密简报。她还注意到，他描述手术过程时，仿佛急切地期待着那一刻的到来。

_The Commander spoke of Adam as if it was the most valuable thing in the world,_ she told herself. _But what he's going to do with that creature once we've implanted it in his hand?_  
司令谈及亚当时，仿佛它是世上最珍贵的东西，她暗自思忖。但一旦我们将那生物植入他手中，他又打算如何处置它呢？

The young doctor shook her head.  
年轻的女医生摇了摇头。

_We have no idea, given that he never told us more about Adam. After all, the Commander always keeps his secrets from the rest of us. I've also got to admit that he's about as paranoid as Joseph Stalin, compared to the other hospital administrators I've worked for before.  
我们对此一无所知，因为他从未向我们透露更多关于亚当的信息。毕竟，指挥官总是对我们保密。我不得不承认，与其他我曾共事的医院管理者相比，他简直和约瑟夫·斯大林一样多疑。_

Odani sighed as she watched one of the displays on the life-support systems, showing just how much the girl was struggling within her sedated state. She only had this moment to say her words to Asuka.  
小谷叹了口气，她看着生命维持系统上的一个显示屏，显示着女孩在麻醉状态下的挣扎程度。她只有这一刻可以对明日香说出她的话。

"Miss Langley," she whispered. "Please forgive me, for it's not my fault, but I always hope that you'll be happy and alive again once you wake up."  
“兰格利小姐，”她低声说道，“请原谅我，这不是我的错，但我总是希望你醒来后能再次快乐并活着。”

Odani then turned to walk away, only to bump unexpectedly into Second Section Agent Tsutomo Kanzaki.  
小谷随后转身离开，却不料意外撞上了第二课的冢本勤代理。

"Oh!" Odani cried in surprise as the man in front of her blinked. "I... I'm sorry," she apologized.  
“哦！”小谷惊呼出声，面前的男子眨了眨眼。“我……对不起，”她连忙道歉。

Unfazed, Kanzaki merely shrugged and answered, "That's okay, Doctor. I just got back from the lounge."  
冢本并未在意，只是耸了耸肩回答道：“没关系，医生。我刚从休息室回来。”

The woman straightened her lab coat. "I see," she acknowledged. "Anyway, Mister Kanzaki, how's it going for your shift?"  
女人整理了一下她的实验服。“我明白了，”她点头表示理解。“那么，神崎先生，你值班的情况如何？”

"Quite sobering, Doctor," he replied as he adjusted his aviator sunglasses. "I wonder... and I always wonder when she'll be out."  
“相当令人清醒，医生，”他一边回答，一边调整着飞行员太阳镜。“我在想……我一直想知道她什么时候能出来。”

Odani looked back to Asuka and sighed. "We don't know, but we're monitoring her life signs for major brain activity. As far as I feel about it, she's still fighting."  
尾谷回头看向明日香，叹了口气。“我们不清楚，但我们正在监测她的生命体征，观察是否有大脑活动的迹象。就我个人而言，我觉得她仍在坚持战斗。”

"Fighting?" Kanzaki wondered.  
"战斗？" Kanzaki 疑惑道。

"I took note of her ECG readings for the last few days," Odani commented. "But the biggest spikes pop during the afternoon or at night in ten minute lengths."  
"我留意了她这几天的 ECG 读数，" Odani 评论道，"但最大的峰值出现在下午或晚上，持续十分钟左右。"

"Which means that...?" “也就是说...？”

"She's having several bad nightmares, some of them which are repeatedly consistent."  
"她正经历着几个糟糕的噩梦，其中一些反复出现且内容一致。"

Kanzaki grunted in disappointment. "Damn. What are you doctors going to do then?"  
神崎失望地哼了一声。“该死。那你们这些医生打算怎么办？”

"As the Commander has ordered, we have no other option except to wait until he orders us to ship her back to Germany," Odani answered dryly. "This means I can't even do a MRI scan to find out."  
"正如指挥官所命令的，我们别无选择，只能等待他下令将她送回德国，”织谷回答得干巴巴的。“这意味着我甚至不能进行 MRI 扫描来查明原因。”

The young agent managed himself a slight frown. "Great," he muttered.  
年轻的特工微微皱了皱眉。“太好了，”他喃喃自语。

But before Kanzaki could launch into a whispered complaint about Commander Ikari and the agent's personal sympathies with the other Children, he checked the impulse. _It's not the right time to do that,_ he warned himself inwardly. _Loose lips would put me in deep shit._  
但在神崎能开始低声抱怨碇司令和这名特工对其他孩子们的个人同情之前，他抑制住了冲动。现在不是做这种事的时候，他内心警告自己。口无遮拦会让我陷入大麻烦。

Instead, the young agent decided that it would be best to accept the official decision. "You're certainly right," he glumly spoke. "It will be up to the girl to decide when to get up from that bed. But I know how you feel about Miss Langley."  
相反，年轻的特工决定最好接受官方的决定。“你当然是对的，”他沮丧地说，“何时从那张床上起来，得由那女孩自己决定。但我知道你对兰利小姐的感受。”

"Yes, I know," the doctor agreed. "But I've got more work to do."  
"是的，我知道，" 医生同意道。"但我还有更多工作要做。"

"Uh… One thing I need to ask: when you could be available for free?"  
"呃… 我需要问一件事：你什么时候有空闲时间？"

"Pardon me?"

Kanzaki sighed. "I just wish if you could join me sometimes for dinner outside," he offered. "You know, there's a good restaurant down in Odawara where I know the chef personally; he'd once worked in Paris, a bistro with five Michelin stars."  
神崎叹了口气。"我真希望你能偶尔陪我出去吃顿饭，" 他提议道。"你知道吗，在小田原有一家很棒的餐厅，我和那里的厨师很熟；他曾在巴黎工作过，那是一家拥有五颗米其林星的餐厅。"

Natsumi thought for a while, until she decided aloud. "Sounds real interesting. Guess I'll have a day-off in about three days. Is that okay?"  
夏美思考了一会儿，然后大声决定道：“听起来真有意思。我想大约三天后可以休息一天。这样可以吗？”

Kanzaki smiled. "Uh, yeah. That's not a problem," he agreed.  
神崎笑了笑。“嗯，没问题，”他同意道。

"Good," Natsumi said. "I can see it in your eyes, anyway. Sometimes things can get real boring down here. By the way, thanks for the invite, I'll call you once I'm ready."  
“好，”夏美说。“反正我能从你眼中看出来。有时候这里真的很无聊。对了，谢谢你的邀请，我准备好了会给你打电话。”

Kanzaki nodded as he tilted his sunglasses. "You're welcome, Doctor, and thank you, too. Have a nice day."  
神崎点头，调整了一下太阳镜。“不客气，博士，也谢谢您。祝您今天愉快。”

As Odani walked away from the Section Two agent, she made a mental note to have Lieutenant Maya Ibuki come down to her office an hour later for a routine report regarding Kaworu and his medical background. She also made another note for the nurses to comb Asuka's lengthy red hair and straighten the girl's gown.  
当长谷部离开第二课的特工时，她暗自记下让副官碇真嗣在一小时后到她办公室来，进行关于渚薰及其医疗背景的例行报告。她还记下让护士们梳理明日香那头长长的红发，并整理好她的衣服。

Even the comatose deserved dignity.  
即便是昏迷者也值得尊严。

By that time, the Renault had rolled off the expressway ramp and instantly mingled with the afternoon city traffic in Tokyo-2. Skyscrapers towered over their heads while buses and trucks surrounded them. Loud, large billboards on buildings also greeted their eyes, advertising new electronic and food products. Huge plasma TV screens showed the news from one of the big TV channels or the latest entertainment talent, singing and dancing onscreen, flashing those perfect legs and that perfect smile.  
那时，雷诺车已驶离高速公路匝道，瞬间融入东京-2 的午后城市交通。摩天大楼高耸入云，公交车和卡车环绕四周。建筑物上的大型广告牌也映入眼帘，宣传着最新的电子产品和食品。巨大的等离子电视屏幕播放着某大电视台的新闻或最新娱乐才艺，屏幕上闪现着完美的双腿和迷人的微笑。

Finally the Renault parked in a space between an aged sedan and a mini-van.  
最终，雷诺车停在一辆老旧轿车和一辆小型货车之间的空位上。

"This is it," Toji said as they got off the car, with Shinji picking up Pen-Pen after slinging the backpack onto his shoulders. "We're up on the fifth floor," he added.  
"就是这里了，" 他们下车时，真嗣说着，背上背包后顺手抱起了 Pen-Pen。"我们在五楼，" 他补充道。

"And what am I gonna expect?"  
"我还能期待什么呢？"

"By now they know that you're still alive," Toji spoke once they went inside the building's hallway and into one of the elevators.  
"现在他们知道你还活着，" 当他们走进大楼的走廊并进入电梯时，冬二开口说道。"

By the time they got in front of Hikari's door, Shinji put down Pen-Pen on the floor as Toji pressed the doorbell. Almost immediately the door opened.  
当他们站在光家的门前时，真嗣把 Pen-Pen 放在地上，冬二按响了门铃。门几乎立刻就打开了。

It was Hikari and Kensuke, and they blinked before the two boys, the woman behind them and the tropical penguin standing by the Third Children's white sneakers.  
那是光和健介，他们眨了眨眼，面前是两个男孩、他们身后的女人，以及站在第三适格者白色运动鞋旁的热带企鹅。

"S... Shinji?" Hikari mumbled as Mari wedged herself between the two teenagers. The young girl stood a foot smaller than her big brother, and her long black hair was tied into a ponytail. Mari was also wearing baggy denim overalls with the famous face of Hello Kitty stitched in and a Houston Rockets t-shirt.  
“真……真嗣？”光小声说道，玛丽挤进了两个青少年之间。这个小女孩比她哥哥矮了一英尺，长长的黑发扎成了马尾。玛丽穿着宽松的牛仔背带裤，上面绣着著名的 Hello Kitty 脸，还搭配了一件休斯顿火箭队的 T 恤。

The young man smiled a little before he spoke. "Yeah, it's me..."  
年轻人微微一笑，然后开口道：“是啊，是我……”

Without warning Hikari hugged him. "Thank God you're alive... But why... why must it be you guys who should suffer?" she questioned.  
未经预告，光子突然拥抱了他。"感谢上帝，你还活着...但为什么...为什么偏偏是你们要承受这些？" 她质问道。

"I... It's not my decision to be a pilot," Shinji answered.  
"我...成为驾驶员不是我自己的选择，" 真嗣回答道。

Hikari slowly let go of her classmate and frowned. "Why?" she asked. "Can't you guys... No... How and when will you let go living as pilots and try to live normally?"  
光慢慢地放开了她的同学，皱起眉头。“为什么？”她问道。“你们难道不能……不……作为驾驶员的你们，何时才能放下这一切，尝试过上正常的生活呢？”

Shinji shrugged. "I don't know. I just don't know when. Maybe once we get rid of the Angels," he answered.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我不知道。我只是不知道什么时候。也许等我们消灭了使徒之后吧，”他回答道。

The Class Rep sighed, before she composed herself. "That's what I'm hoping for, so tell us more about what happened down there, and after Asuka ran away."  
班长叹了口气，然后整理了一下情绪。“这也是我所希望的，所以请多告诉我们一些下面发生的事情，还有在明日香跑掉之后的情况。”

"Her?"

Hikari nodded. "Yes. As her friend I have to help her."  
光点了点头。“是的。作为她的朋友，我必须帮助她。”

"Okay," Shinji agreed.

Kensuke smiled, eyeglasses twinkling in the afternoon sun. "Hey, old friend! Welcome back to the land of the living!" he greeted Shinji, one Stooge to another.  
健介微笑着，眼镜在午后阳光下闪闪发光。“嘿，老朋友！欢迎回到人间！”他向真嗣打招呼，一个傻瓜对另一个傻瓜。

Shinji gave him a sad smile. "Thanks... I thought you were going to..." he answered.  
真嗣给了他一个苦涩的微笑。“谢谢……我以为你会……”他回答道。

"Forget? Oh, heck, no," Kensuke disagreed, shaking his head. "I'd remember good friends like you! C'mon, let's get inside!"  
“忘记？哦，天哪，不会的，”健介不同意地摇摇头。“我会记得像你这样的好朋友！来吧，我们进去吧！”

They bowed deeply before each other, understanding that they were finally welcome, and walked inside.  
他们彼此深深鞠躬，明白自己终于被接纳，便走进了屋内。

### Chapter 9 Between Friends  
Chapter 9 朋友之间

In Hikari's apartment, they were all seated on pillows around the low coffee table in the middle of the living room.  
在光的家，他们都坐在客厅中央低矮的咖啡桌周围的垫子上。

At first, there was some small talk about the weather, the new junior high school they were studying at, the little issues in Tokyo-3, Touji's checkup (Kensuke said it was to give NERV some good PR), Mari's (surprisingly good) recuperation from an earlier injury, and what Hikari must do to take care of Pen-pen. At the moment the tropicalized penguin was in the kitchen, busy eating sardines from a bowl.  
起初，大家聊了些轻松的话题，比如天气、他们就读的新初中、东京-3 的小麻烦、冬二的身体检查（剑介说这是为了给 NERV 做点正面宣传）、真希波（出乎意料地）从之前的伤势中恢复得很好，以及光子必须如何照顾企鹅潘-潘。此刻，那只热带化的企鹅正在厨房里忙着从碗里吃沙丁鱼。

Now, however, Shinji and Misato wondered how they could explain Asuka's predicament, but Hikari, sensing what they were thinking, first told them of the days that led to the Second Children's self-destruction.  
然而现在，真嗣和美里在想如何解释明日香的困境，但光子察觉到了他们的想法，首先向他们讲述了导致第二适格者自我毁灭的那些日子。

Hikari took a deep breath and began, "I told her not to take herself too seriously," she said, facing Shinji. "But it seemed that she didn't want to listen, and for the life of me, she's too focused as if her entire life depended on wearing that plug suit. Anyway, she showed up to me later that afternoon with her bag... Said she ran away, pissed off at everyone and didn't want to return to you because she failed. I said to her that she shouldn't worry about that and take a rest instead. So she did… except she spent the rest of the day in front of the PS3. She was that really mad."  
光小心翼翼地深吸了一口气，开始说道：“我告诉她不要太过认真对待自己，”她面对着真嗣说，“但她似乎不想听，而且她太专注了，好像她的一生都取决于穿上那件插入栓服。不管怎样，那天下午晚些时候她带着包来找我……说她离家出走了，对每个人都生气，不想回到你那里因为她失败了。我告诉她不必为此担心，应该休息一下。所以她就这么做了……只是她把剩下的时间都花在了 PS3 前。她真的很生气。”

She glanced for a moment at a distant framed picture of her and Asuka placed on the television cabinet, both of them smiling before Kensuke's digital camera.  
她瞥了一眼远处电视柜上她和明日香的照片，两人在健介的数码相机前微笑着。

Seeking even an ounce of comfort, Hikari caressed Toji's hand.  
寻求哪怕一丝安慰，光轻轻抚摸着士的手。

"That night," Hikari continued, "as we were about go to sleep, she began to cry and I feared that I was giving her a hard time, so I told her I didn't meant to let her down. I also tried to talk about it with her."  
"那天晚上，"光继续说道，"我们正要睡觉时，她开始哭泣，我担心自己给她添了麻烦，于是告诉她我不是有意让她失望的。我也试着和她谈了谈这件事。"

"_I'm... I'm sorry for bothering you," Asuka whispered as the girl pulled up the sheets over herself, her back turned away._  
"我……对不起，打扰你了，"明日香低声说，女孩拉起被子盖住自己，背对着光。"

"_No... I'm trying to help you," Hikari replied sympathetically._  
"不……我是在帮你，"光同情地回答。"

"_I didn't win, you see... I lost everything..." Asuka mumbled, but her voice changed into scorn. "I hate... I really hate... I hate everybody... damn it…"_  
"我没能赢，你看...我失去了所有..." 明日香喃喃自语，但她的声音转变成了嘲讽。"我恨...我真的恨...我恨所有人...该死..."

"_But Asuka..."_ "但明日香..."

"_No! I hate myself!" Asuka answered almost angrily, cutting Hikari off. "I don't care about anything... I have nothing to do! Aimless! Worthless! Do you think that I can live with this? No!"_  
"不！我恨我自己！" 明日香几乎愤怒地回答，打断了光。"我不在乎任何事...我无所事事！毫无目标！一文不值！你以为我能这样活下去吗？不！"

_There was a quiet pause as she began to cry, and Hikari couldn't do anything except to watch her.  
她开始哭泣，四周陷入一片静默，光只能无助地看着她。_

"_I think that you can do anything you want," Hikari spoke calmly after a few minutes, choosing the right words. "I don't blame you... I always believe that you've done well."_  
“我觉得你想做什么都可以，”几分钟后，光平静地说，斟酌着合适的词句，“我不怪你……我一直相信你做得很好。”

_Asuka responded only with her sobs. Hikari thought of placing a friendly hand on the girl's shoulder, except with such a volatile emotional state, she decided against it.  
明日香只是抽泣着回应。光本想友好地把手放在女孩的肩上，但考虑到她如此波动的情绪状态，她决定还是不要这么做。_

"_Don't worry... We'll talk about it first thing in the morning," Hikari said, amidst the soft cries in the room._  
"别担心...我们明早第一件事就是谈这个，" 光在房间里轻声哭泣中说道。

"...But when I woke up, she was gone and I tried finding her, and this is all what she'd left," Hikari lamented at last, before she pulled something from her pocket and laid down a piece of paper on the table.  
"...但当我醒来时，她已经不见了，我试图找到她，这就是她留下的全部，" 光终于哀叹道，然后从口袋里拿出一样东西，放在桌子上。

Misato palmed the paper and read it. In block print, Asuka scribbled a felt-tipped disappointment on that piece of paper:  
美里拿起那张纸阅读。在纸上，用粗体字，明日香用马克笔留下了失望的痕迹：

_I'm a loser._

"I don't blame her," Hikari continued. "Unfortunately… I don't really know what really made her that serious about being a pilot. She never told me much about herself, which means that there is something truly wrong with her."  
"我不怪她，" 光继续说道。"不幸的是…我真的不知道是什么让她对成为一名飞行员如此认真。她从未向我透露太多关于她自己的事，这意味着她确实有些问题。"

Still sitting, Misato was now having a dilemma. _How I could say?_  
仍然坐着，美里现在陷入了两难。我该怎么表达呢？

But silence alone only makes matters worse.  
但沉默只会让事情变得更糟。

There was nothing else she could do except to break open the whole story.  
她别无选择，只能揭开整个故事的真相。

"I know her," Misato finally said. "I tried to hide this up from all of you, but understand that what I'm going to tell you about Asuka isn't going to be pretty." She could now see the surprise or frowns upon the teenagers' faces around her.  
"我了解她，"美里终于说道，"我曾试图向你们所有人隐瞒这一点，但请理解，我要告诉你们的关于明日香的事情不会是美好的。"她现在可以看到周围青少年脸上的惊讶或皱眉。

"I'm all ears," Kensuke decided.  
"我洗耳恭听，"健介决定道。

Touji sighed, but nodded in agreement. "We're all in this together before, so I think it's not gonna hurt if it's all right to talk about ourselves."  
冬二叹了口气，但还是点头同意。“我们之前都是一起经历过的，所以我觉得聊聊自己应该没什么坏处。”

"As her friend, this is the right time you have to tell us," Hikari added. "Maybe then we could try to help out."  
“作为朋友，现在是你该告诉我们的时候了，”光补充道。“也许那样我们就能试着帮忙。”

And so Misato, in clear violation of NERV regulations, began by narrating about Asuka's childhood that was greatly scarred by the death of her mother, and how it shaped her personality into what she was now today.  
于是，美里在明显违反 NERV 规定的情况下，开始讲述明日香童年时因母亲去世而深受创伤的经历，以及这段经历如何塑造了她如今的性格。

---

There was this supposedly happy family, and Asuka's mother was then a scientist working on Project E, before something went terribly wrong with her after testing Unit-02. Her mother was so traumatized that she developed a severe mental disorder that they sent her to an observation ward, and days later committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling. No more than a few weeks later Asuka was recruited for Project E as one of the Children.  
曾经有一个表面上幸福的家庭，那时明日香的妈妈还是 E 计划的一名科学家，直到她在测试二号机后发生了可怕的变故。她的母亲因此遭受了极大的心理创伤，患上了严重的精神疾病，被送进了观察病房，不久后便上吊自杀了。仅仅几周之后，明日香就被招募进入 E 计划，成为其中的一名孩子。

Asuka's father eventually remarried, but no sooner afterwards she became hostile towards her parents, developed this misguided sense of self-supremacy, yearned to grow up, thinking she could be free of emotional ties from everyone else, built a façade to bury her past, but most of all she wanted to be on top of the food chain.  
明日香的父亲最终再婚了，但不久后她对父母产生了敌意，形成了一种错误的高人一等的自我感觉，渴望长大，以为这样可以摆脱与他人的情感牵绊，建立了一个掩盖过去的假象，但最重要的是，她想要站在食物链的顶端。

Asuka wanted to win all the time, thinking it was her happiness; losing was a word she feared as if it was a tentacle monster trying to pull her down.  
明日香总是想要赢，认为这就是她的幸福；失败这个词她害怕得如同一个试图将她拖下水的触手怪物。

Only that psychic attack from that Angel hovering in orbit literally destroyed her motivation and purpose.  
只有那个在轨道上盘旋的天使所施加的心灵攻击，才真正摧毁了她的动力和目标。

Asuka lay silent in her hospital bed, amidst of the beeping of the life-support systems crowded besides her bed. Oxygen quietly hissed into her lungs, while dextrose laced with muscle relaxants and sedatives slowly dripped into the tube, and thence into her bloodstream.  
明日香静静地躺在医院的病床上，周围是密集的生命维持系统发出的哔哔声。氧气悄无声息地进入她的肺部，而混有肌肉松弛剂和镇静剂的葡萄糖溶液则缓慢地通过导管滴入她的血液中。

The afternoon sun, its beam channeled by a series of reflectors leading down to the Geofront, was blocked behind by thick drapes, giving the room dim light clashing with fluorescent lamps.  
午后阳光通过一系列反射镜引导至地底都市，却被厚重的窗帘遮挡，使得房间内光线昏暗，与荧光灯形成鲜明对比。

With all of her five senses nearly tied down by sedatives, she could barely smell the disinfectant mopped on the linoleum floor; or she could little hear the rhythmic beeps of the machines, for her mind was shut off completely from the rest of the world.  
由于五感几乎被镇静剂所束缚，她几乎闻不到地板上被拖过的消毒水味；也几乎听不见机器有节奏的哔哔声，因为她的意识已完全与外界隔绝。

_In her dream, Asuka floated in the depths of an ink-darkened ocean, naked, semi-conscious and dazed. As the length of her red hair slowly moved to the motions of her head, she could also feel the cold from the ether, as if Death finally claimed her soul with his eternal scythe.  
在梦中，明日香赤裸着漂浮在漆黑深海中，半清醒半迷茫。随着她红色长发缓缓随头部动作摆动，她也能感受到来自虚空的寒冷，仿佛死神终于用他永恒的镰刀夺走了她的灵魂。_

_"W... where am I?" she whispered, amid the darkness.  
"我...我在哪儿？" 她在黑暗中低语。_

_The answer came with a sound.  
答案随着一声响传来。_

_At first she could barely hear a noisy, rhythmic beat, but then it began to fade in, focusing until she could finally discern the sound of helicopter blades slashing through the air.  
起初，她几乎听不到那嘈杂而有节奏的敲击声，但随后它开始逐渐增强，聚焦到她终于能分辨出直升机叶片划破空气的声音。_

_The piercing rotor slashes now came with the roar of turbines, their loud whines filling out as light slowly filtered in, the darkness around the girl fading into amber brilliance.  
此刻，刺耳的旋翼切割声伴随着涡轮机的轰鸣，它们的尖啸声逐渐充斥四周，光线缓缓透入，女孩周围的黑暗渐渐褪去，化为一片琥珀色的辉煌。_

_Opening her eyes to the light, Asuka could finally see, but all she had were blurry images. The girl struggled to focus her vision, making out the fuzzy shape and lines of a bathtub, a rectangle of white light and a musty smell coming into her nostrils. She gazed skyward, found the blur of blue and white shining through the jagged hole on the tiled roof.  
睁开双眼迎接光明，明日香终于得以看清，但眼前尽是模糊的影像。女孩努力聚焦视线，辨认出浴缸的模糊轮廓、一束白色的矩形光线以及钻入鼻孔的霉味。她仰望天空，透过瓷砖屋顶上的锯齿状破洞，看到了蓝白相间的模糊光晕。_

_Focusing further at the hole, Asuka waited for a moment, wishing to be free of the sensation of slowed-up motion, blurred, distorted images and inaudible sounds... and she got her momentary wish, the brief shadow of a large helicopter crossing her line of sight as it flew over the roof.  
明日香更专注地盯着那个破洞，等待片刻，渴望摆脱那种动作迟缓、影像模糊、声音失真的感觉……她短暂地如愿以偿，一架大型直升机的阴影掠过她的视线，飞越屋顶。_

_But she heard an unexpected crack, as if someone stepped onto the wooden floor.  
但她听到了一声意外的断裂声，仿佛有人踏上了木地板。_

_Asuka heard more steps echoing with increasing loudness.  
明日香听到更多脚步声，回响声越来越响亮。_

_Finally through blurred eyes, Asuka made out the specter of a man's shadow, framed by the door and lit from behind with blinding-white sunlight.  
透过模糊的视线，明日香终于辨认出一个男人的身影，被门框所框住，身后是刺眼的白色阳光。_

_But he was no longer alone, as other shadows quickly joined him in a huddle.  
但他不再孤单，其他影子迅速聚集在他周围。_

Who… Who's it? _She wondered._  
谁……是谁？她疑惑着。

_"Miss Langley... We're taking you home," the shadow said.  
“兰利小姐……我们带你回家，”那影子说道。_

_Still dazed, Asuka frowned._ Why I must be taken home?  
依旧茫然，明日香皱眉。为什么我必须被带回家？

_The atmosphere now accentuated with blade whines, the shadow talked with other shadows before the three of them walked towards her. One played a beam of light over her blue eyes, nearly blinding the girl; another took hold of her left wrist.  
此刻，刀刃的嗡鸣声加剧了氛围，影子与其他影子交谈后，三人向她走来。一个用一束光照亮她蓝色的眼睛，几乎让她失明；另一个则抓住了她的左手腕。_

_Unexpectedly a buzzing sound assailed Asuka's ears, cutting off any more of the conversation, before she felt several gloved hands lift her out of the tub and laid her down onto a stretcher... or so she thought. A second later she sensed someone wrapping a roll of bandage around her slashed wrist and the painful prick of a needle or two into her forearm, causing the girl to gnash her teeth in agony.  
出乎意料的是，一阵嗡嗡声打断了明日香的话，随后她感到几双戴着手套的手将她从浴缸中抬起，放在担架上……至少她是这么认为的。片刻后，她感觉到有人用绷带缠绕她割伤的手腕，以及手臂上针刺的疼痛，让她痛苦地咬紧牙关。_

_However, the pain quickly disappeared as her body began to relax and drift back, along with her heart throbbing down to a slower pace.  
然而，随着身体开始放松并逐渐沉回，以及心跳放缓，疼痛很快消失了。_

_Asuka sensed the stretcher beneath her shake and rock, as the shadows surrounded her before the sunshine glared on her face in an orange glow behind the eyelids. But after a while the brightness faded once again to black…  
明日香感觉到担架在身下摇晃，阴影包围了她，随后阳光在眼睑后以橙色光芒照耀。但过了一会儿，明亮再次褪去，归于黑暗……_

Misato was now on her second can of Yebisu by the time she was finished giving the short version of Asuka's biography.  
当美里讲完明日香生平的简短版本时，她已经喝完了第二罐惠比寿啤酒。

"I'm sorry if I held up Asuka's story for too long," Misato apologized as she tabled the empty can. "It's still my fault."  
“如果我拖长了明日香的故事，我很抱歉，”美里将空罐放在桌上，道歉道，“这仍然是我的错。”

"Don't try to blame yourself," Hikari answered. "At least we now understand why. If she were here now, I'd tell her to let go of her past because that's not going to work for her."  
"别自责了，"光回答道，"至少我们现在明白了原因。如果她现在在这里，我会告诉她放下过去，因为那对她没有好处。"

"I'll tell her that and all," Misato answered. "It's still my responsibility to take care of her. I have hell to pay."  
"我会告诉她这些的，"美里回答，"照顾她仍然是我的责任。我得付出代价。"

"Maybe you should bring her here," Hikari suggested. "We'll take care of her."  
"也许你应该带她来这里，"光建议道，"我们会照顾她的。"

Misato shook her head. "That may be a better idea, but there's a catch. Only the Commander is in the way, as he has the final say on that matter."  
美里摇了摇头。“那或许是个更好的主意，但有个问题。只有司令官挡在前面，因为他对这件事有最终决定权。”

Hikari let her palm fall upon her face.  
光子将手掌贴在脸上。

Touji frowned. "Now that's gonna be harder," he muttered. "I personally don't like that walking refrigerator. Instead, maybe you can try going first to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki," he suggested. "I think he's a real okay guy compared to the Big Man," he added, referring to Commander Ikari and his demigod tendencies.  
冬二皱起眉头。“这下可难办了，”他低声嘀咕。“我个人不喜欢那个移动冰箱。或许你可以先去找副司令福音津，”他建议道。“我觉得他比那位大人物要好得多，”他补充说，指的是司令官碇源堂及其半神般的行事风格。

Misato pondered for a moment, wondering what better to do with Asuka's fate, until she found a decision.  
美里沉思片刻，思索着该如何处理明日香的命运，直到她做出了决定。

"I'll see what I can do," Misato said. "Try to convince them in any way because personally, I can't think of her being in the bed everytime I'm there. There may be a slim chance, but I'll do the best I can."  
“我会尽力而为，”美里说。“尽量说服他们，因为就我个人而言，我无法想象每次去那里时她都躺在床上。虽然机会渺茫，但我会尽我所能。”

The other teenagers nodded in agreement.  
其他青少年点头表示同意。

But Shinji felt unsure, as the full history of Asuka's life made him uncomfortable, and he couldn't stop hearing her screams in his mind. So he stood up and walked to the balcony.  
但真嗣感到不安，阿斯卡的全部过往让他感到不适，脑海中不断回响着她的尖叫声。于是他站起身，走向阳台。

"Guys, I need to go out there," he said as he opened the sliding doors. "I have to think over something."  
“伙计们，我得出去一下，”他拉开滑动门说道，“我需要思考一些事情。”

---

After swimming, they were alone this time, sitting together on a bench outside the pyramidal Headquarters. For some relief from the slight chill of the pool, Kaworu and Rei bought vegetarian Cup Noodles and bottled cold green tea. They ate their meal in silence.  
游泳后，这次他们独自坐在金字塔形总部外的长椅上。为了缓解泳池带来的些许寒意，薰和绫波买了素食杯面和瓶装冷绿茶。他们默默地吃着饭。

Before that, while he showered, Kaworu was thinking of the odd psychic rushes that he experienced since yesterday, seeing everything in the people he made physical contact with. Sure, he'd already saw the past in Misato and Shinji, but only Rei gave him more questions than answers, but for now he didn't want to talk about it. Still, he needed to discover more of this mysterious gift, as it seemed that even his SEELE masters never told him about the full extent of his physiology.  
在那之前，当他洗澡时，渚薰一直在思考自昨天以来经历的奇怪心灵冲动，他通过与人的身体接触看到了一切。当然，他已经看到了美里和真嗣的过去，但只有绫波给了他更多问题而非答案，但目前他不想谈论这件事。尽管如此，他需要探索这个神秘天赋的更多奥秘，因为似乎连他的 SEELE 主人也从未告诉他关于他生理机能的全部真相。

Now he was listening, not as someone wanting to pass on secrets, but with genuine interest. Rei was trying to open herself up.  
现在他在倾听，不是作为一个想要传递秘密的人，而是带着真正的兴趣。绫波正试图敞开心扉。

"I had a dream, yet I thought it was almost real," Rei began. "All I could see were mere images that were hard to define, as if they ran past me. But I heard myself saying 'If I let loose, there is no way my AT-Field would ever contain it. The Field will disintegrate. I must hold on.' I could not remember how and when I said those words. That awakened me, yet I am still confused."  
“我做了一个梦，但我以为它几乎是真的，”绫波开始说道。“我能看到的只是难以界定的图像，仿佛它们从我身边掠过。但我听到自己说‘如果我释放出来，我的 AT 力场永远无法容纳它。力场将会瓦解。我必须坚持住。’我不记得何时何地说过这些话。这唤醒了我，但我仍然感到困惑。”

"Was it amnesia?" Kaworu asked as he unscrewed his bottle of tea.  
"是失忆吗？" 渚薰一边问，一边拧开他的茶瓶。

"The doctors told me it was only a concussion. However, I studied this problem alone but there is no solution."  
"医生告诉我只是脑震荡。不过，我独自研究了这个问题，但找不到解决办法。"

"But still… Have you tried to understand what you have dreamed?"  
"但即便如此……你有没有尝试去理解你梦到了什么？"

Rei shook her head lightly.  
丽轻轻地摇了摇头。

However, Kaworu gave her a faint smile. "You can at least try to describe," he advised, before he drank from the bottle.  
然而，薰给了她一个淡淡的微笑。“至少你可以尝试描述一下，”他建议道，随后喝了一口瓶中的液体。

She closed her eyes, and began trying to recall whatever images she saw from that dream.  
她闭上眼睛，开始努力回忆梦中看到的那些画面。

"I saw myself inside an Entry Plug," she began. "When or why I was there I do not know. I heard myself saying those words, yet at the same time I felt an intense pain as if something hard was wrapped around me."  
"我看到自己在插入栓里，"她开始说道，"我不知道那是何时，为何会在那里。我听到自己在说那些话，但同时我感到一种强烈的疼痛，仿佛有什么坚硬的东西紧紧包裹着我。"

"Like you're being crushed?" Kaworu asked.  
"就像被压碎一样？" 渚薰问道。"

Rei nodded. 绫点点头。

The gears in Kaworu's mind were beginning to turn, recalling whatever he read from the files on the plane, figuring if there were details on Rei's last mission. He imagined flipping through the pages over and over… and the realization hit him: apparently he'd probably known only half the information on her, bits and pieces from Touji Suzuhara and Shinji, and the rest of it, or the complete truth if it existed, was with those up high. Only the Commander and maybe the Chairman probably knew everything.  
川岛的脑海中齿轮开始转动，回想着他在飞机上从文件中读到的内容，试图找出关于绫波最后一次任务的细节。他想象着自己一遍遍翻阅那些页面……突然间，他意识到：显然，他可能只了解她一半的信息，零零碎碎的片段来自铃原东治和真嗣，而其余的部分，或者说完整的真相，如果存在的话，只掌握在高层手中。只有司令官，或许还有董事长，可能知道一切。

This meant that it was up to him to find it.  
这意味着，找到真相的重任落在了他的肩上。

"There could be a way to solve that," Kaworu said.  
“或许有办法解决这个问题，”川岛说道。

"How it could be done?"  
"这怎么可能做到？"

Kaworu took a sip from the bottle, and then placed it onto the bench. "The only way you may try to remember is to have some form of information about yourself, say, pictures, recordings, journals, and so on. I believe that they're still out there somewhere. Then you piece all of them together, and we could get a clear picture of what you were before."  
渚薰从瓶中喝了一口，然后将它放在长凳上。"要尝试回忆，唯一的办法是找到关于你自己的一些信息，比如照片、录音、日记等等。我相信它们还在某个地方。然后你把这些碎片拼凑起来，我们就能清楚地了解你以前的样子。"

"Where this information could be found?"  
"这些信息能在哪里找到？"

"First, we need to ask the right people," Kaworu answered. "We can't simply tiptoe around; we know security is pretty tight in here."  
“首先，我们需要找对人，”渚薰回答，“我们不能只是蹑手蹑脚地绕圈子；我们知道这里的安保非常严密。”

His mind was now working out a plan, figuring out where to start. First thing he needed to do is to simply look at the hierarchy within NERV: key people with access to vital information. Since SEELE already tasked him the business of infiltrating himself into the very heart of NERV, his superiors expected him to bring anything important.  
他的大脑现在正在制定计划，思考从哪里开始。首先他需要做的是简单地审视 NERV 内部的层级结构：掌握关键信息的重要人物。既然 SEELE 已经指派他渗透进 NERV 的核心，他的上级期望他能带回任何重要的情报。

But which was essential, the mission or solving Rei's biggest problem?  
但关键在于，是完成任务还是解决绫波的最大难题？

"I don't know if it's easy but we'll try," Kaworu decided.  
"我不知道这有多容易，但我们试试吧，"渚薰决定道。

---

Shinji was standing alone at the balcony, and below was a constant flow of traffic on the road below. He was deep into self-reflection, trying not to think too much of Asuka lying on the Infirmary bed, nor doubt about Rei and her tendency to comply with his father's authority. Sure, Kaworu asked him to try to be at least courageous in any way he can, but even then there was always this insecurity biting his soul.  
真嗣独自站在阳台上，楼下是川流不息的车流。他沉浸在自我反思中，尽量不去想躺在医务室床上的明日香，也不去怀疑绫波和她顺从父亲权威的倾向。当然，渚薰让他至少要勇敢一点，但即便如此，内心的不安始终在啃噬着他的灵魂。

He sought for praise, mostly from his father, but it seems that some of them were out of insincerity. He made many sacrifices and took the blows, but at what cost? For the sake of praise? Happiness? Purpose? Humanity?  
他渴望得到父亲的赞扬，但似乎其中有些是出于虚伪。他做出了许多牺牲，承受了打击，但代价是什么？为了赞扬？幸福？目的？人性？

He could remember the words when he first came amidst the first Angel attack.  
他记得第一次天使袭击时自己刚到这里的情景。

"_The replacement turned out to be useless."_  
“替换品最终证明是无用的。”

The Man was disgusted, not expecting him to be as firm as he wanted to be, yet the assault on the Geofront, and an injured Rei in his arms spurred him to get onboard, panicked at the prospect of being destroyed.  
男人感到厌恶，没想到他会如此坚定，然而对地表的攻击和怀中受伤的丽促使他匆忙登机，担心被摧毁。

Since then he experienced a mixture of triumph and tragedy, making him unsure as to where his destiny would be.  
自那以后，他经历了胜利与悲剧的交织，使他对命运的归宿感到迷茫。

Shinji looked at his left hand, remembering the last Angel he dealt with shortly before the death of Unit-00. He saw the malignant growth suddenly turned into miniature heads of Rei. It scared him yet he couldn't move in sheer terror.  
真嗣看着自己的左手，回想起在零号机牺牲前不久对付的最后一个使徒。他看到那恶性的肿瘤突然变成了迷你版的绫波丽头部。这让他既害怕又动弹不得，完全被恐惧所支配。

Quickly he closed his eyes, attempting to erase the memory of that horror, but the sunlight glare of a passing car's windshield shone onto his eyes, and he saw in his mind's eye the seemingly harmless beam of light from an orbital Angel withered Asuka inside and out. Shinji could hear the screams, not unlike someone being burned alive.  
他迅速闭上眼睛，试图抹去那段恐怖的记忆，但一辆经过的汽车挡风玻璃反射的阳光刺入他的眼帘，他脑海中浮现出从轨道使徒发出的看似无害的光束，将明日香内外都枯萎了。真嗣能听到那尖叫声，宛如一个人被活活烧死一般。

Shinji shuddered. It seemed that he was now being saved for last, for an enemy he wasn't sure in what form that would come, but then there was Kaworu, a new friend telling him to be firm, try to deal with his predicament, and if possible fight on his side when the time comes.  
真嗣颤抖着。看来他现在被留到了最后，面对一个他不确定会以何种形式出现的敌人，但随后有了薰，一个新朋友告诉他要坚定，努力应对自己的困境，并在可能的时候站在他这边。

He sighed, realizing that today he was supposed to allow more encouragement from his classmates. They never doubted him, understood his nature and his insecurities, and above all they still loved him.  
他叹了口气，意识到今天他应该从同学们那里得到更多的鼓励。他们从未怀疑过他，理解他的本性和不安，最重要的是，他们依然爱他。

Love. Something he could never get from his father, even after surviving many skirmishes. Those eyes behind the glasses only told him of a single-minded drive Shinji didn't know about, save for the fact that this father wanted him to be an unlikely savior of mankind. But what is love if it isn't reciprocated, and instead there were nothing but insincerity between them?  
爱。这是他从父亲那里永远得不到的东西，即使在经历了多次战斗之后。眼镜后的那双眼睛只告诉他一种真嗣不了解的执着，除了这个父亲希望他成为人类不可能的救世主。但如果爱没有得到回应，而他们之间只有虚伪，那爱又是什么呢？

There was nothing to be gained from his father, so instead the only affection he could have was from the people around him, who see him more of a human being than someone commandeering an Eva.  
从他父亲那里得不到任何东西，因此他唯一能得到的关爱来自他周围的人，他们将他视为一个真正的人，而非仅仅是一个操纵 Eva 的工具。

This was why he was supposed to enjoy their company today, even for a brief moment, because tomorrow there may be no chance for him to savor it again.  
这就是为什么他今天应该享受与他们在一起的时光，哪怕只是短暂的一刻，因为明天可能就没有机会再品味这份温馨了。

"Mind if I can join?" Kensuke said as he came out, snapping Shinji from his reverie. He was carrying two cans of cola and gave one to Shinji, before they pulled the tabs.  
“介意我加入吗？” 真希说，他走出来，打断了真嗣的沉思。他拿着两罐可乐，递给真嗣一罐，然后他们一起拉开了拉环。

"Say, how many months you were with the Eva program?" Kensuke asked, before he gulped in some of the soda. It was a simple question Kensuke posed once in a while, even if it seemed to be very pointless.  
“哎，你在 Eva 项目里待了几个月了？”真希问，然后喝了一口汽水。这个问题真希时不时会提出来，尽管看起来毫无意义。

Shinji frowned a bit, and answered, "I think I'm in it for six … Maybe seven months."  
真嗣微微皱眉，回答道：“我想我参与了六个月……或许七个月。”

Kensuke sighed. "I confess this, but I realized how truly terrible your quandary is. At first, I thought it was cool to be just like you, until Touji lost his arm and leg in the process, only then it put sense into me not to be a pilot. Anyway, why do you have to keep on staying?"  
真希叹了口气。“我承认这一点，但我意识到你的困境有多么糟糕。起初，我觉得像你一样很酷，直到东治在过程中失去了手臂和腿，那时我才明白不该当驾驶员。话说回来，你为什么还要继续留下来？”

"I'm not a pilot for the sake of my father or myself, except…"  
"我并非为了父亲或自己而成为驾驶员，除了……"

There was a moment's hesitation for Shinji to think, before there was the answer.  
碇真嗣犹豫了一会儿，思考着，然后给出了答案。

"I have this… This emptiness and I need to fill it in," he admitted. "I thought piloting gave me purpose and happiness, but… I couldn't find meaning in it. It nearly killed me and almost everyone else, except there's no way out."  
"我感到这种……这种空虚，我需要填补它，"他承认道。"我以为驾驶能给我带来目标和快乐，但是……我找不到其中的意义。它几乎让我和所有人丧命，然而却无路可逃。"

"I think you still have a reason," Kensuke spoke, "even if you think it's meaningless. Besides, you can't rely too much on Eva for your own happiness, that's why we're here for you."  
"我觉得你仍有理由，" 真希波说道，"即便你认为它毫无意义。此外，你不能过于依赖 Eva 来获得自己的幸福，这就是我们在这里支持你的原因。"

"What?"

"Misato is the closest thing you can have for a big sister," Kensuke said as he adjusted his glasses with his index finger. "She, I still believe, is what makes you come back and fight again. Nobody else can do that and I mean _nobody_, and I swear that anyone else riding your Entry Plug will crap their pants if they ever come close to an Angel. You have to be damn lucky being with her, and I think since she has as much worries as you have, it's a good thing you still manage to get along. You also have only a few cool friends you can count on; friends who _actually_ care, with genuine concerns for you. That should be able to fill that emptiness, make you feel happy and better, and try to answer that friendship just like what we're doing right now. My father is the only family I have left, yet it's also a good thing that we're all in the same boat. Be glad at least that you're a brother I would like to have, and Hikari and Misato are also sisters in my eyes, too."  
"美里是你能拥有的最接近姐姐的存在，" 真希波说着用食指调整了一下眼镜。"我相信，正是她让你重新振作，再次战斗。没有人能做到这一点，我指的是任何人，我敢发誓，任何其他人坐进你的插入栓，面对使徒时都会吓得尿裤子。能和她在一起，你真是幸运至极，而且我认为，既然她和你一样忧心忡忡，你们还能相处融洽，这真是件好事。你也有几个真正关心你的酷朋友；他们真心实意地为你担忧。这应该能填补那份空虚，让你感到快乐和更好，并像我们现在这样努力回应这份友谊。我父亲是我唯一的亲人，但同样幸运的是，我们都在同一条船上。至少要庆幸，你是我愿意拥有的兄弟，而光和美里在我眼中也是姐妹。"

Kensuke was correct. 真希波说得没错。

Shinji should be glad at least for this friendship, the little reward he was experiencing right now, a pleasure denied from him most of the time by the cruelty of the situation he was often involved in. Friends like Touji, Hikari and Kensuke reminded him of what humanity truly laid within him, and their existence and interaction shaped his life experience.  
至少这份友谊让真嗣感到欣慰，这是他此刻正在体验的小小回报，大多数时候，残酷的处境剥夺了他的这种快乐。像东治、光和剑介这样的朋友，让他想起了自己内心真正的人性，他们的存在和互动塑造了他的生活体验。

At the moment, in this corner of the world, what little time he and Misato had with them was irrelevant; the fact that he was still welcome was better than nothing.  
此刻，在这个世界的角落，他和美里与他们共度的短暂时光无关紧要；他仍然受到欢迎，这总比什么都没有好。

"You're right," Shinji agreed.  
“你说得对，”真嗣同意道。

Both young men chuckled a bit, Shinji feeling relieved for this bit of advice.  
两个年轻人都轻声笑了起来，真嗣因为这番建议而感到些许宽慰。

"Thanks," he answered. "谢谢，" 他回答道。

Kensuke grinned. "It's my pleasure. At least we still remind you that you're _not_ alone. Anyway, yesterday I heard from my dad about a new pilot. He made a big splash around NERV about big sync ratios and blah-blah."  
健介咧嘴一笑。“这是我的荣幸。至少我们还能提醒你，你并不孤单。话说回来，昨天我听我爸提到一个新驾驶员。他在 NERV 引起了不小的轰动，说什么同步率超高之类的。”

Shinji took a swig from his can, and said, "Him? His name's Kaworu and I've met him yesterday, and he'd also spent a night with us at the condo."  
真嗣从罐子里喝了一口，然后说：“他？他叫渚薰，我昨天才认识他，他还和我们一起在公寓过了一夜。”

"Really?" Kensuke asked, "What does he look like?"  
“真的吗？” 剑介问道，“他长什么样？”

Shinji described Kaworu in detail, and then notes the eerie physical similarities between him and Rei, their differences in speech and manner, and their first case of interaction, especially this morning's corridor collision.  
真嗣详细描述了渚薰的外貌，然后注意到他和绫波之间诡异的相似之处，以及他们在言语和举止上的差异，还有他们第一次互动的情况，特别是今早走廊上的碰撞。

"Well, finally, looks like there's someone to defrost Rei," Kensuke declared before he chuckled. "It's a damn good thing."  
“好吧，终于，看起来有人能给绫波解冻了，”健介宣布后轻声笑道。“这真是件大好事。”

Shinji scratched his head, perplexed. "What's so funny about it?"  
真嗣挠了挠头，困惑不解。“这有什么好笑的？”

"I can imagine things."  
"我能想象一些事情。"

"Like what?"

Amused, Kensuke grinned as he shook his head. "This might be too much of a coincidence, but from the looks of it either they're twins or look like husband and wife."  
觉得有趣，真希波笑着摇了摇头。“这可能太巧合了，但看样子，他们要么是双胞胎，要么就像夫妻一样。”

"I know. Touji noticed that while we were eating lunch back there."  
"我知道。我们在那边吃午饭时，东治也注意到了。"

"Since you've said that Kaworu has red eyes, and we know that Rei also has red eyes, and both of them are almost albino and have strange hair, isn't it very weird?"  
既然你提到渚薰有红眼睛，而我们知道绫波零也有红眼睛，他们俩都近乎白化病且拥有奇异的头发，这不是很奇怪吗？

It was true that Shinji recently seen only half of the oddities inside the Geofront, some of them were repelling or gruesome enough to send him shutting his eyes away, and some of them still left him with more questions than answers.  
确实，真嗣最近只看到了地底都市中的奇异现象的一半，其中一些足以让他感到排斥或恐怖到闭上眼睛，而另一些则让他疑问重重，答案却寥寥无几。

However, Shinji wasn't aware that at this moment Kaworu was trying to resolve Rei's problem despite being an enigma himself.  
然而，真嗣并不知道，此刻薰正在试图解决丽的问题，尽管他自己也是一个谜。

"Doctor, this is what I called you in for," Gendo Ikari spoke before Natsumi Odani, who was standing in attention, trying not to be distracted by the mysterious Sephirotic diagrams on the floor and the ceiling of his "throne room".  
“医生，这就是我叫你来的原因，”碇源堂在夏美·小谷面前说道，她正笔直站立，尽量不被地板和天花板上神秘的“生命之树”图所分心。

On his desk was her preliminary report for the surgical operation to be done tonight. So far, this was the second time she was in this office, and a privileged few have ever been summoned to be here.  
他的桌上摆放着她为今晚即将进行的手术所准备的初步报告。迄今为止，这是她第二次踏入这间办公室，而能被召见至此的，实属少数特权人士。

"To be sure, sir," Natsumi answered. "I have prepared the operating theater for tonight, along with the best available security I requested to make sure there will be no leaks. Everyone else involved will be briefed, and should anything goes wrong, we'll try to bring your hand back to normal." Natsumi gestured at the report on the desk, which Gendo began to read. "Testing results in that report has indicated that there should be no rejection problem with you, the biological host, and the 'special guest'."  
“当然，先生，”夏美回答道，“我已经为今晚的手术室做好了准备，并请求了最佳的安全措施，确保不会泄露任何信息。所有相关人员都将接受简报，万一出现差错，我们会尽力将您的手恢复原状。”夏美指了指桌上的报告，源堂开始阅读。“那份报告中的测试结果表明，作为生物宿主的您和‘特别嘉宾’之间应该不会出现排斥问题。”

The "special guest" was the Adam embryo that Gendo was to be a host to, the one that he requested Ryouji Kaji to acquire at great cost.  
所谓的“特别嘉宾”，正是源堂将要作为宿主的亚当胚胎，那个他委托加持良治不惜代价获取的珍贵之物。

"Go on," Gendo said.  
“继续，”源度说。

"We'll try to use skin grafts from your back and a biologically-neutral elastic membrane to hold it down, and then seal it with a laser at a moderate power setting. There will be some bleeding, but overall it should heal quickly, and if both of you are biologically compatible, the guest should merge into your palm in a week."  
“我们将尝试从你的背部取皮肤移植和一种生物中性弹性膜来固定它，然后用中等功率的激光密封。会有一些出血，但总体上应该会很快愈合，如果你们俩生物学上兼容，客人应该在一周内融入你的手掌。”

Gendo nodded. "Good. I'll have no problem with concealment. Since you are concerned about my well-being during the course of the operation, I understand with the knowledge of anaesthetics, that I have not consumed anything before this operation."  
源度点头。“很好。隐蔽不成问题。既然你关心我在手术过程中的健康，我知道麻醉的知识，我在这之前没有摄入任何东西。”

Natsumi briefly noticed a shining glint coming off Ikari's glasses, as he seemed to be pleased with high expectations for tonight.  
夏美注意到郁朗的眼镜上闪过一丝光芒，他似乎对今晚抱有很高的期待。

"Thank you for having that foresight, Commander," she replied.  
“感谢您的先见之明，指挥官，”她回答道。

"Finally, you'll have full clearance on whatever you need to ensure that this operation is a success. I have full trust in your abilities, just as your job description says."  
“终于，你将获得你所需的一切权限，确保这次行动成功。我完全信任你的能力，正如你的职位描述所言。”

Inside the main NERV building, at the bank of elevators in its atrium, Kaworu and Rei were facing each other as they were about to part. There was this expressionless calm on Rei's face, yet Kaworu knew inside that she has this little feeling of relief as he noticed her eyes.  
在 NERV 主楼的中央大厅电梯旁，渚薰和绫波零面对面即将分别。绫波的脸上依旧是一片无表情的平静，但渚薰从她的眼中察觉到了一丝微小的释然。

"I hoped that you're okay this time," Kaworu said. "But just as I said before, I'll see what I could do. Maybe for the rest of the day you'll do fine."  
“我希望这次你能安然无恙，”渚薰说道，“但正如我之前所说，我会尽力而为。或许今天剩下的时间里你会一切顺利。”

"Thank you," Rei answered.  
“谢谢你，”绫波回答道。

Without much ado, Kaworu slowly reached out for her left hand and held it softly.  
没有太多繁琐的仪式，渚薰缓缓地伸出手，轻轻握住了她的左手。

This time, unlike that psychic torrent that he earlier experienced and nearly overwhelmed him, he could now sense serenity within her, like a calm sea on high noon of blue skies, but there were no flashbacks. Happy or relieved or satisfied, he couldn't tell, but only her cerise eyes said to him that she was all right.  
这一次，不同于之前他经历的那股几乎将他淹没的心灵洪流，他现在能感受到她内心的宁静，如同晴朗正午时分的平静海洋，但没有闪回的记忆。他无法分辨她是快乐、释然还是满足，只有她那双樱桃色的眼睛告诉他，她一切都好。

This physical bond lasted for almost a minute, and they never moved an inch.  
这种身体上的联系持续了近一分钟，他们一动不动。

Now Kaworu let go of her hand. "Take good care," he reassured as the elevator doors opened before him.  
此刻，渚薰松开了她的手。“好好照顾自己，”他安慰道，电梯门在他面前缓缓打开。

"Thank you. I will see you tomorrow," Rei replied before the doors closed.  
“谢谢你。明天见，”绫波零在门关闭前回应道。

---

As the elevator lurched upward, Kaworu thought of whom he'll need to get some information on Rei, but the easiest place to start is with Misato.  
电梯向上颠簸时，渚薰思索着需要向谁打听关于绫波零的信息，但最简单的起点无疑是美里。

_Maybe easy,_ he contemplated, _but I suppose that I have to convince her. After all, she's probably the only one who has more knowledge about Rei than what I possess right now. I can't just simply go around and sneak into someone's files._ Kaworu just needed the right way of approaching the idea, but the last mess he wanted was blowing up his own cover.  
或许不难，他思忖着，但我得说服她。毕竟，她可能是目前唯一对绫波了解比我更多的人。我总不能随便闯入别人的文件里。碇真嗣需要找到合适的接近方式，但他最不希望的就是暴露自己的身份。

By the time he was in his little living quarters, Kaworu grabbed a pen and a pad, and began writing down everything he knew. He made a rough outline:  
当他回到自己的小住处时，碇真嗣抓起一支笔和一张纸，开始记录他所知道的一切。他草拟了一个大纲：

_Rei: emotionless, has no idea of her past due to last mission. Needs help recovering memories... At any rate, she's learning.  
绫波：无情感，因上次任务对过去一无所知。需要帮助恢复记忆……无论如何，她在学习。_

_Asuka: personal anger over loss of piloting ability. Almost killed herself. If wakes up must realize her personal self-worth. Life worth living for.  
明日香：因失去驾驶能力而个人愤怒。几乎自毁。若醒来必须认识到个人自我价值。生命值得活下去。_

_Shinji: much of a worrier. Fears father. He needs encouragement. Have to let go of his past.  
真嗣：过于担忧。害怕父亲。他需要鼓励。必须放下过去。_

_Misato: the past makes her a prisoner. Loss of Kaji cause of depression, but she tries to hide it.  
美里：过去使她成为囚徒。失去加持是抑郁的原因，但她试图隐藏。_

Kaworu brushed his hand over those gray tufts of hair, thinking. He then marked Misato's name with "1", assigned Rei a number "2", Shinji as number "3", and finally Asuka was given a "4".  
渚薰轻抚着那些灰白的绒毛，沉思着。他随后在美里名字旁标记了“1”，绫波为“2”，真嗣为“3”，最后给明日香标记了“4”。

On that order, if he managed to persuade Misato to overcome her personal problems, she'll help him out deal with Rei; once he gets Rei a complete picture of her past, the next step is to end Shinji's self-misery, and he'll have to get Asuka in a very long conversation as an outlet for personal self-examination or at least give her some sense.  
按照这个顺序，如果他能说服美里克服个人问题，她将帮助他处理绫波的事；一旦他让绫波全面了解她的过去，下一步就是结束真嗣的自我折磨，而他必须与明日香进行一次漫长的对话，作为个人自我反省的出口，或者至少给她一些启示。

"Tomorrow," Kaworu told himself. "Tomorrow is where I'll start," he repeated.  
“明天，”渚薰对自己说。“明天我将开始，”他重复道。

In his office and while pacing around the desk, killing time, Gendo Ikari was toying with a new idea that came up just after Natsumi Odani left.  
在办公室里，一边绕着桌子踱步消磨时间，碇源堂正琢磨着一个新点子，这念头刚在小谷夏澄离开后冒出来。

The scheme involved having Rei to have a compatibility test with Unit-01, and since this time she didn't have any of the "defects" that her predecessor possessed, her "renewed purity" would be helpful in trying to get his own Dummy Plug project back in working order. Furthermore, Kaworu Nagisa and his surprising statistics gave him more impetus to make new improvements.  
计划包括让绫波零与初号机进行适配测试，由于这次她没有前任存在的任何“缺陷”，她的“更新纯净”将有助于恢复他自己的傀儡系统项目运作。此外，渚薰令人惊讶的数据统计为他提供了更多动力去进行新的改进。

The last time was a series of unacceptable and costly failures. But if that new test succeeded, he'll try to restart the program once more with better data. Have a team of bioengineers reclone Rei and put each and every one of her in the Plugs, and show SEELE who's the winner. That would be one chance to make a sure return on his investment.  
上次是一连串不可接受且代价高昂的失败。但如果这次新测试成功了，他会尝试再次重启项目，用更优质的数据。让一支生物工程师团队重新克隆绫波，并将每一个她放入插入栓中，向 SEELE 展示谁才是赢家。这将是一次确保投资回报的机会。

Gendo promptly took one of the phones on his desk and dialled.  
源堂迅速拿起桌上的一个电话，拨了出去。

"Get me the head of Bioengineering," he said into the reciever, "and whoever is in charge of the Test Facility. I want them here."  
“给我接生物工程部门的负责人，”他对着听筒说，“还有测试设施的负责人。我要他们立刻过来。”

---

While Hikari was having her turn playing with Pen-Pen, Misato pulled Touji aside to the corridor leading to the bathroom, and whispered into his ear.  
当光在和 Pen-Pen 玩耍时，美里把真嗣拉到通往卫生间的走廊，低声对他说。

"Sorry," she said almost quietly. "For his sake, I'm not going to repeat what I said about Kaji."  
"对不起，"她几乎轻声说道，"为了他的缘故，我不会重复我对加持说的话。"

Touji frowned. "Why?" 冬二皱眉。"为什么？"

Misato shook her head. "I don't want to get any more emo on this while we had our lunch. I'm not going to add more misery to your girlfriend's mood, especially after we talked about Asuka. So we'll have to keep quiet."  
美里摇了摇头。"我不想在吃午饭的时候再陷入这种情绪。我不想再给你的女朋友增添更多烦恼，尤其是在我们谈过明日香之后。所以我们得保持沉默。"

After a brief thought, he agreed. "Okay, if that's what you want."  
经过短暂的思考，他同意了。“好吧，如果你想要那样。”

"Thanks," Misato answered.  
“谢谢，”美里回答道。

Just as she was done, Shinji and Kensuke were back inside with their empty cans of cola, which they tossed into the wastebasket. Both of them were giddy about having some fun, to lighten up the mood.  
就在她刚说完时，真嗣和健介带着空可乐罐回来了，他们把罐子扔进了垃圾桶。两人都因为能找点乐子来活跃气氛而感到兴奋。

"Hey, thought we might get that 720 running," Kensuke said, inviting for a multiplayer game as he pointed at the Xbox 720 sitting besides the TV set. "It's still early out here, so who wants to try? We also have Rock Band if you like."  
“嘿，我们或许可以玩那台 720，”健介指着电视旁的那台 Xbox 720，提议来场多人游戏，“现在还早，谁想来试试？我们还有《摇滚乐队》，如果你喜欢的话。”

Everyone in the room suddenly wanted to play, and Shinji was aching for a real challenge, something to get his mind off the pain. But Misato needed something else to do, as she felt the vibration coming from her cellular phone.  
房间里的每个人都突然想玩，真嗣渴望一个真正的挑战，好让自己从痛苦中分心。但美里有别的事情要做，因为她感觉到手机在震动。

"I'll pass," she reminded Kensuke. "I have to talk to someone outside."  
"我会离开，"她提醒健介，"我得去外面见个人。"

Kensuke gave her a thumbs-up. "Sure, Big Sister, no problem," he answered before heading off to the bedroom to get the Rock Band instruments out of the box.  
健介向她竖起大拇指。“当然，大姐，没问题，”他回答后便朝卧室走去，准备从箱子里取出摇滚乐队乐器。

---

Once out on the balcony and she closed the sliding door, Misato noticed Makoto Hyuga's number on display, pressed _Call_, and to be sure she also activated the scrambler.  
一走到阳台并关上滑动门，美里注意到显示的是桐生真琴的号码，按下呼叫键，为了确保安全还启动了加密器。

"Hi. Are you there?" Misato asked. "I'm ready... Sorry if I sound gloomy."  
“嗨。你在吗？”美里问道。“我准备好了……如果听起来有些忧郁，抱歉。”

"All right... I'm on a small break, right outside and drinking coffee and I got some more data I've swiped a few minutes ago," he answered. "Managed to break into Maya's notebook and copied the stuff, and you know what I've found out? Nagisa is capable of doing the theoretically impossible."  
"好吧...我现在正在外面休息，喝着咖啡，刚刚又弄到了一些数据，"他回答道。"设法侵入了真希的笔记本，复制了资料，你知道我发现什么了吗？渚能做到理论上不可能的事情。"

"Speak in Japanese," Misato chided him for clarity's sake. "Slow down."  
"用日语说，"美里为了清晰起见责备他。"慢点说。"

"Sorry about that... Judging from what I've skimmed," Makoto explained carefully, "he can keep his sync lowered down to as low as 20 percent to give an Angel an impression that he's easy game."  
"抱歉...根据我浏览的内容，"真琴小心翼翼地解释道，"他可以将同步率降低到 20%，让使徒以为他很容易对付。"

"What happens next?" "接下来会发生什么？"

"And then the next big thing, yes, this is the real whopper... Nagisa can jam up his sync ratio up to around 90 percent or even higher, enough power to cut a big hole into an AT-Field and blow the Angel to kingdom come."  
"然后是下一个重磅消息，没错，这可是真正的猛料……渚能将同步率提升到 90%甚至更高，足以在 AT 力场上切开一个大洞，把使徒炸得灰飞烟灭。"

Misato blinked. "Come again?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“你说什么？”

"Nagisa can adjust his sync ratio by complete will, as simple to him as flipping TV channels… or maybe able to walk on water."  
“渚可以完全凭借意志调整同步率，对他来说就像切换电视频道一样简单……或者说是能够行走于水面之上。”

"But that's unbelievable!" she disagreed.  
“但这太不可思议了！”她反驳道。

"And we can see a blue moon once in a while, Major," Makoto countered. "But although the data are just the preliminaries, it's almost clear to see what else he actually has in store for us, but we'll need more sync tests to be done on him for the next few days to make sure."  
“我们偶尔也能看到蓝月亮，少校，”真琴反驳道，“但尽管这些数据只是初步的，几乎可以清楚地看出他还有什么隐藏的实力，但我们还需要在接下来的几天里对他进行更多的同步测试来确认。”

"Right," Misato agreed. "He's bidding his time, but don't worry, we'll always keep an eye on him."  
“好吧，”美里同意道，“他在伺机而动，但别担心，我们会一直盯着他的。”

"Anyway, since you want to see more of what I got, I'm sending you the biggie right now," Makoto said.  
“总之，既然你想见识更多我的本事，我现在就给你看个大的，”真琴说道。

A second later Misato could see data being uploaded into her phone's flash memory, before she heard a chime. _Download complete._  
片刻后，美里看到数据上传到她的手机闪存中，随即听到一声提示音。下载完成。

"I got it now," she confirmed. "I'll check it out tonight."  
"我现在明白了，"她确认道。"今晚我会去查看。"

"Thanks, Major. Good luck on your way home."  
"谢谢，少校。祝你回家路上顺利。"

"Thanks to you, too, I'll see you tomorrow. Carry on the good work," Misato concluded.  
"也谢谢你，明天见。继续努力，"美里总结道。"

Right there, Misato was now thinking as she pocketed the phone, and she'll have to know where to start asking questions. Naturally the one person on her mind she would get her an answer was Ritsuko, but there could be one better way:  
就在这时，美里一边想着一边把手机放进口袋，她得知道该从哪里开始提问。自然而然地，她脑海中浮现出的人选是律子，但或许还有更好的办法：

At the right moment, she'll confront and grill Kaworu Nagisa on her own terms, demanding what were his true intentions for being here and who's really pulling his strings.  
在合适的时机，她会用自己的方式面对并盘问渚薰，追问他来这里的真正意图，以及背后操纵他的人究竟是谁。

In her lonely and cracked apartment, far away from everyone else, silence once again dominated Rei Ayanami's world as she sat on the side of her bed, save for the two refrigerators with their muffled compressor hums. Thinking of herself and that gnawing emptiness within since the day she walked out of the Infirmary. Doubts and questions of self-worth bothered her most of the time, pondering the meaning and purpose of her life.  
在远离众人的孤独裂痕公寓里，沉默再次主宰了绫波零的世界，她坐在床边，除了那两台冰箱发出的低沉压缩机嗡鸣声。自从那天她走出医务室以来，内心一直有一种啃噬般的空虚感。自我价值的怀疑和问题困扰着她大部分时间，思考着她生命的意义和目的。

Today, however, Kaworu Nagisa changed all that.  
然而，今天，渚薰改变了这一切。

Though unable to express herself outwardly, Rei could still savor the warmth and feeling of Kaworu's hand, long after they parted at the atrium. His hand was soft, much different from the calloused palms and fingers of the Commander. The aftereffect of such physical contact, it seemed for her, overpowered the strange odor emanating from that box full of bloodied old bandages and the packed wastebasket. Even the decay and dirt around the room no longer mattered.  
虽然无法在外表上表现出来，但绫波仍能长久地回味与渚薰在门厅分别后，他手上的温暖感觉。他的手柔软，与指挥官那布满老茧的掌心和手指截然不同。这种身体接触的后效，对她而言，似乎盖过了那个装满血迹斑斑旧绷带和塞满垃圾的盒子里散发出的怪味。甚至连房间里的腐朽和污垢也不再重要。

She could feel the answer to her anguish was forthcoming, and the one that would fill the vast void in her beating heart.  
她能感觉到，她痛苦的答案即将到来，那个将填补她跳动心脏中巨大空虚的人。

She could not smile but serenity dominated her soul.  
她无法微笑，但宁静主宰了她的灵魂。

For the first time in days, Rei thought she could sleep peacefully tonight.  
这是几天来，丽第一次觉得今晚可以安然入睡。

---

Before leaving, Misato and Shinji exchanged goodbyes with their friends, with the woman kneeling down and whispering promises to Pen-Pen that she'll come back.  
离开前，美里和真嗣与朋友们道别，美里跪下轻声向佩佩承诺她会回来。

"Hey, promise that you guys come back," Touji said. "You're not so bad playing, considering that you haven't got an Xbox of your own."  
"嘿，答应我们会回来的，" 冬二说。"考虑到你自己没有 Xbox，玩得还不错。"

"Shinji nodded. "Thanks, and speaking of coming back, we'll see."  
"真嗣点头。"谢谢，说到回来，我们会再见的。"

"Tell Asuka to get well," Hikari added, before she hugged him. "Don't quit."  
"告诉明日香快点好起来，" 光在拥抱他之前补充道。"别放弃。"

Misato pointed a finger at Hikari and said, "Take good care of Pen-Pen."  
美里用手指着光说：“好好照顾 Pen-Pen。”

Kensuke grinned. "We'll do, this little fella will do fine… and oh, try to bring Asuka and Rei with you."  
健介咧嘴一笑。“我们会照顾好这个小家伙的……哦，对了，尽量带上明日香和丽一起来。”

Misato grinned. "Sure, no problem. We'll see you soon. Touji, get well. Watch out wherever you're walking."  
美里咧嘴一笑。“当然，没问题。我们很快就会见面的。真治，早日康复。走路时小心点。”

"I'll be careful," Touji answered and then laughed.  
"我会小心的。" 冬二回答，然后笑了。

They all exchanged hugs and back-claps, and for Shinji, brotherly kisses on the cheek from Hikari and Mari.  
他们互相拥抱，拍背，对真嗣来说，还有来自光和玛丽的兄弟般的亲吻在脸颊上。

As they walked away, Misato checked her watch and figured that she and Shinji still have enough time to make it to the cemetery, which was halfway between here and just north of Tokyo-3. For the first time in weeks both of them felt much better, and this morale boost also gave Misato the courage to visit Kaji's grave.  
当他们离开时，美里看了看手表，估计她和真嗣还有足够的时间赶到墓地，那墓地位于这里和第三新东京市北部的中间。几周以来，两人第一次感觉好多了，这种士气的提升也给了美里勇气去拜访加持的墓。

---

While lying on his futon, Kaworu thought about the first report he would have to address before the SEELE council tonight. Of course, he'll tell them about the current status of his work, but only what they _wanted_ to hear. Good thing and so far they've kept him alone as he did his duty at their bidding.  
躺在榻榻米上的渚薰，思索着今晚在 SEELE 议会上需要处理的第一份报告。当然，他会告诉他们自己工作的最新进展，但只会是他们想听的部分。幸运的是，到目前为止，他们一直让他独自执行任务，按照他们的指示行事。

Lying besides him was a detailed contour map of the Hakone area, a set of orbital coordinates for the geostationary communication satellites he would be using, and a list of transit times. He'd encircled the data he needed with a pen, and set his alarm clock so it'll tell him when to wake up and go.  
他身边放着一张详细的箱根地区等高线地图，一组用于他将要使用的地球同步通信卫星的轨道坐标，以及一份交通时间表。他用笔圈出了所需的数据，并设置了闹钟，以便在起床出发时提醒自己。

Kaworu closed his eyes and thought of the two days that passed since his arrival. He also had in his mind's eye the psychic images that comprised of Misato's and Shinji's memories, mostly tragedies in their respect pasts, and their thoughts. They had mixed hopes and aspirations, the longing and the pain, and what conflicts that were tearing their souls apart.  
渚薰闭上眼睛，回想着抵达后的这两天。他的脑海中还浮现出真嗣和美里记忆中的心灵图像，主要是他们各自过去的不幸，以及他们的思想。他们怀揣着复杂的希望和抱负，渴望与痛苦交织，内心的冲突正撕裂着他们的灵魂。

Only with Rei that he found only a few pieces within her. Try as he could, most of the jigsaw puzzle pieces of her memories were missing. There was also the silent anguish, and above all, the seemingly endless loop of self-doubt, as she was trying to assess her personal self-worth.  
只有在丽身上，他发现她的记忆碎片寥寥无几。尽管他竭尽全力，她记忆的拼图大部分仍遗失不见。还有那无声的痛苦，以及首要的，她试图评估自我价值时那无尽的自我怀疑循环。

It struck him as strange that the most imperfect people were chosen to be Eva pilots.  
他觉得奇怪，为何最不完美的人会被选为 EVA 驾驶员。

Why?

Is it because only when they were at their emotional extremes that they could link themselves more easily to the Evas?  
难道是因为只有在情感极端时，他们才能更轻易地与 EVA 建立联系？

Yes.

Considering that Evas were always linked and controlled through the A-10 nerve, and humans normally use about twenty percent of their brain power, Kaworu concluded that the brain waves of the pilots are greatly amplified during heightened emotional or psychological states, increasing control capability; hence their sync ratios could be measured based by the amount of bioelectrical and nerve impulses.  
考虑到 EVA 始终通过 A-10 神经连接并控制，而人类通常只使用大约 20%的大脑能力，渚薰推断，在情绪或心理状态高度紧张时，驾驶员的脑波会大幅增强，从而提高控制能力；因此，他们的同步率可以通过生物电和神经冲动的数量来衡量。

There was always a price to be paid for being one of the Children: they have to possess self-imperfection to operate the Evas, especially when there was either pain or pleasure involved.  
成为孩子们中的一员总是要付出代价的：他们必须具备自我不完美性才能操作 EVA，尤其是在涉及痛苦或快乐时。

Both pleasure and pain, it was also one of the natural inner imperfections of the Lilim, intertwined since birth till death; one begets the other as part of the universal opposites.  
快乐与痛苦，这也是莉莉姆内在的自然缺陷之一，从出生到死亡交织在一起；它们作为宇宙对立面的一部分相互衍生。

---

Before they came to the cemetery, Misato made a few stops to the grocery for a carton of premium sake, a flower shop for two bouquets and a bundle of joss sticks, then had her Renault refueled at a service station.  
在他们前往墓地之前，美里先去了趟杂货店买了一盒高档清酒，又到花店买了两束鲜花和一捆香，随后在加油站给她的雷诺车加满了油。

This cemetery alone held more than half a million dead, and there were dozens of cemeteries such as this one throughout Japan, most of them for the victims of the Second Impact tsunami, the riots that followed, and North Korea's nuclear missile strike against Tokyo. In the middle of the cemetery was a Shinto shrine, dedicated to its silent residents six feet below and encapsuled in small white boxes.  
仅这个墓地就安葬了超过五十万逝者，而日本各地像这样的墓地还有数十个，大多数是为了纪念第二次冲击海啸、随后的骚乱以及朝鲜对东京的核导弹袭击中的遇难者。墓地中央有一座神社，献给那些六英尺之下、封存在小小白色盒子里的沉默居民。

Now, here they were standing before Ryoji Kaji's grave. The dirt on the plot was almost fresh, about two weeks old, and the engrave tombstone with his name on was shiny-new except for the thin coating of dust.  
现在，他们站在碇真嗣的墓前。墓地上的泥土几乎还是新鲜的，大约两周前刚埋下，刻着他名字的墓碑崭新发亮，只是蒙上了一层薄薄的灰尘。

In her mind, Misato replayed the tape recording:  
在美里心中，她反复播放着那盘录音带：

"_Misato, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message, after I caused you so much trouble. Sorry. Please tell Ritsuko that I'm really sorry. And there's one more thing to trouble you with: I've been growing flowers. I'd appreciate it if you could water the flowers for me. Shinji knows where they are. The truth is with you. Don't hesitate. Just move ahead!"_  
“美里，是我。我确信你正在听这条留言，在我给你惹了这么多麻烦之后。对不起。请告诉律子，我真的很抱歉。还有一件事要麻烦你：我一直在种花。如果你能帮我浇花，我将不胜感激。真嗣知道它们在哪里。真相在你手中。不要犹豫。只管前进！”

_There was a second of hesitation before Kaji spoke again.  
片刻犹豫后，加持再次开口。_

"_If I can see you again, I promise that I will say the words that I couldn't say to you eight years ago. Bye."_  
"如果还能再见你一面，我承诺我会说出八年前未能对你说出口的话。再见。"

"Sorry too if we're a bit late," Misato said almost quietly. "I don't think you're concerned with time anymore. My concerns right now are justice and the truth you're saying about."  
"如果我们迟到了，也请见谅，" 美里几乎轻声说道，"我想你现在已不再关心时间了。我此刻关心的是正义和你所言的真相。"

With care, Misato laid down the bouquet of lilies and roses before the tombstone, lit and planted some joss sticks, and they settled down for a quiet prayer with her palms together. Once done, with the carton of sake as her tribute, she uncorked it and poured the sake onto the tombstone. The clear wine washed away the collected reddish dust from the black marble, making it gleam in the afternoon sun like new.  
美里小心翼翼地将百合与玫瑰花束放在墓碑前，点燃并插上几支香，然后双手合十，静静地祈祷。结束后，她用一盒清酒作为祭品，打开瓶塞，将酒缓缓倒在墓碑上。清澈的酒液冲刷掉了黑色大理石上积聚的红色尘土，使其在午后阳光下闪耀着新生的光芒。

"Cheers," Misato spoke. "I hope you can enjoy it."  
"干杯，"美里说道。"希望你能喜欢。"

Shinji said nothing, but he went to his mother's grave, which was three plots away, and laid the flowers and stuck smoking joss sticks into the soil. For him, it no longer mattered if that grave never contained Yui Ikari's remains. All he needed was to pay some respect as he stood there. He recalled the last time he talked with someone while standing here.  
真嗣没有说话，但他走到母亲的墓前，那墓离这里隔了三个墓位，他将鲜花摆好，并插上点燃的香。对他来说，那墓中是否真的有绫波唯的遗骸已不再重要。他需要的只是在墓前表达敬意。他回想起上次站在这里与人交谈的情景。

"_It's been three years since the last time I was here with you alone," Gendo said almost quietly. At a distance, he stood before the gravestone, but there was little of emotion on his face, and even the eyes behind the glasses betrayed nothing._  
"距离上次我独自和你来这里已经三年了，"碇源堂几乎轻声说道。他在远处站在墓碑前，脸上几乎没有表情，就连眼镜后的眼睛也未透露出任何情感。

_But Shinji kept a respectable distance from him. He was morose and he was aware of the pain of being here.  
但真嗣与他保持着适当的距离。他忧郁寡欢，深知身处此地的痛苦。_

"_I ran away," he said, "I've never tried to come here till now. I don't think she rests here, and I don't even remember her face."_  
“我逃走了，”他说，“直到现在我才尝试来到这里。我不认为她安息于此，我甚至记不清她的面容。”

"_People continue to live by moving on," Gendo answered. "Nevertheless, we have something that we always have to remember. Your mother let me know of that useful fact, and to make sure of that I come here out of respect."_  
“人们继续生活，靠的是不断前行，”碇源堂回答，“然而，我们总有一些东西必须铭记。你的母亲让我明白了这一有用的事实，为了确保不忘，我出于敬意来到这里。”

_Shinji turned to face his father. "Don't you have her picture or something?" he asked.  
真嗣转向他的父亲。“你难道没有她的照片之类的吗？”他问道。_

_Gendo shook his head, as if the question wasn't of his concern. "She's not here," he replied flatly. "There's only her gravestone as a reminder."  
碇源堂摇了摇头，仿佛这个问题与他无关。“她不在这里，”他平淡地回答，“只有她的墓碑作为提醒。”_

_The young man sighed. "My teacher used to say that you have to let go."  
年轻人叹了口气。“我的老师曾经说过，你必须放手。”_

_There was no silence between them, letting the words sink in their thoughts, before Gendo broke the silence.  
他们之间没有沉默，任由话语沉入思绪，直到碇源堂打破了这份宁静。_

"_The important thing is that I'm content enough to remember," he answered._  
“重要的是，我满足于这份记忆，”他回答道。

"At least you still remember," Misato said, taking him away from his reflection. "When the last time you saw her smile?"  
“至少你还记得，”美里说道，将他从沉思中拉回。“你上次见到她的笑容是什么时候？”

Shinji shrugged, but trying to recollect. "I don't know. Maybe I was five."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，努力回忆着。“我不记得了。可能我那时五岁吧。”

Misato sighed. "Just wishing I should've met your mom a long time ago."  
美里叹息道。“只是希望我早些时候能遇见你妈妈。”

"Why?"

"She's a legend in her own right. Knew what she was doing even if it was dangerous and impossible, and everyone else would've backed out from the job she was in. The one thing that bothered me about her was that I've yet to ask the Sub-Commander, because he's the other one most close to her, apart from your father, and probably knows her intimately."  
"她是个传奇人物。明知任务危险且看似不可能完成，却依然勇往直前，换作别人早就退缩了。让我一直困扰的是，我还没来得及问副指挥官，因为他除了你父亲外，是与她最亲近的人，可能对她了解颇深。"

"But why he's still quiet about my mother?"  
"但他为何对我母亲的事仍保持沉默？"

Misato shook her head. "Still probably out of respect or, worse yet, fear for your father and his work. Nevertheless and lately, given how things are becoming strained, and how he's acting, I have that woman's intuition: they have very different ideas on where NERV should be heading. The Sub-Commander isn't happy getting along with your father, and so perhaps that's why he's a little more frank while we were eating with him."  
美里摇了摇头。“可能还是出于对你父亲的尊重，或者更糟的是，对他和他的工作的畏惧。不过最近，考虑到局势日益紧张，以及他的行为举止，我有种女人的直觉：他们在 NERV 的发展方向上有着截然不同的看法。副指挥官并不乐意与你父亲共事，或许这就是为什么他在与我们共餐时显得稍微坦率一些。”

Shinji nodded. "One question," he spoke, changing the subject. "Has anyone told you who actually killed Kaji?"  
真嗣点点头。“一个问题，”他转换了话题，“有人告诉过你究竟是谁杀了加持吗？”

"I knew the details from the Sub-Commander, who did the identification after he was called up by the coroner," Misato said, recalling the autopsy and forensics reports. "Three hollowpoint slugs, he mentioned. Post-mortem, the coroner pulled two from the chest cavity and one from the head. Nine-millimeter rounds with grooves on the slugs. Ballistic testing and identification confirmed that it was from a 92F Beretta... Silenced, I think. It was a close-up shot and there was no struggle, because it seems that Kaji knew his killer, and his gun was still stuck into the waist holster… But, all in all, they couldn't identify the shooter and they're still looking into leads."  
"我从副指挥官那里得知了细节，他在被验尸官叫去后进行了身份识别，"美里说道，回忆起尸检和法医报告。"他提到了三颗空尖弹。死后，验尸官从胸腔取出两颗，从头部取出一颗。九毫米子弹，弹头上带有凹槽。弹道测试和识别确认这是来自一把 92F 贝雷塔...应该是装了消音器。这是一次近距离射击，没有挣扎痕迹，因为似乎加持认识凶手，他的枪还插在腰间的枪套里…但总的来说，他们无法确认射击者身份，目前仍在追查线索。"

She, however, left out this part: throughout the questioning by Section Two, she kept her composure from cracking as she examined the gruesome photos of the murder scene, and only upon returning home afterwards she managed to cry and mourn in her bedroom.  
然而，她省略了这一部分：在整个第二课的审讯过程中，她保持着镇定，没有崩溃，只是在回到家后，她才得以在卧室里哭泣和哀悼，仔细检查了那些令人毛骨悚然的谋杀现场照片。

Misato pursed her lips for a moment. "Since it's taking too long finding this murderer, then I'll do the hunting myself... and maybe kill the sonofabitch," she added.  
美里抿了抿嘴唇，片刻后说道："既然找这个凶手花了这么长时间，那我就亲自去追捕...也许还会干掉那个混蛋，"她补充道。

There would be no crying anymore. Revenge was now driving her.  
不再有泪水。复仇之心正驱使着她。

_And once I have all the pieces together,_ Misato thought, _I'll also make a dead man speak._  
一旦我将所有碎片拼凑起来，Misato 心想，我还能让死人开口说话。

The man who shot Kaji was in the driver's seat of his Toyota utility van, listening to the radio (covering an exhibition baseball game between the Buffalo Yankees and the Hanshin Tigers) while eating an early dinner from a bento box picked up from the local Lawson's convenience store. He was dressed as a telephone utility man with a false name, and clipped to his right ear was a Bluetooth earset.  
那个枪杀 Kaji 的男人正坐在他的丰田工具车的驾驶座上，一边听着广播（正在直播布法罗洋基队与阪神虎队之间的表演棒球赛），一边从当地罗森便利店里买来的便当盒中享用着提前的晚餐。他装扮成电话维修工，使用假名，右耳上夹着一个蓝牙耳机。

Apart from his scrambler-enabled cellular phone resting on its cradle as it was being charged, there was also a black-toned Beretta 92F pistol just below his seat, with a new barrel and a sound suppressor screwed in. Mounted to the center console was a notebook computer turned on and with live access to wireless Internet tapped into the local NTT network. On the passenger seat, for his personal entertainment, laid a dog-eared, two-month-old copy of _Sabra_ magazine with Maria Ozawa on its cover.  
除了放在充电座上充电的防窃听手机外，座位下方还藏着一把黑色调的 Beretta 92F 手枪，新换的枪管上旋接了消音器。中控台固定着一台笔记本电脑，已开机并实时接入当地 NTT 网络的无线互联网。副驾驶座上，供他个人消遣的是一本翻得破旧、两个月前的《Sabra》杂志，封面是 Maria Ozawa。

At the back of the van was mostly packed with telephone maintenance equipment, harnesses and rolls of wire, and this vehicle had the NTT company logo stuck on the sides. The perfect cover, commonplace and inconspicious, and fortunately the killer knew much about fixing telephone lines and Internet modems and did his cover role perfectly. The van was at a parking lot just off Route 75 that rimmed Lake Ashinoko, and there wasn't much traffic to and from Tokyo-3 ever since the Angel attacks intensified.  
货车后部主要装载了电话维修设备、安全带和成卷的电线，车身两侧贴着 NTT 公司的标志。绝佳的伪装，平凡而不引人注目，幸运的是，这名杀手对修理电话线和互联网调制解调器颇为熟悉，完美地扮演了自己的掩护角色。货车停靠在环绕芦之湖的 75 号公路旁的一个停车场，自使徒袭击加剧以来，往返于第三新东京市的交通流量已大为减少。

A triple agent, he'd been here for eight months and still going nicely. NERV and the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs thought he was working for their respective intelligence sections.  
作为三重间谍，他已在此潜伏八个月，且进展顺利。NERV 和日本内务省均以为他在为各自的情报部门效力。

Oh, he can kill so easily like a cobra without hesitation; sneak in, take anything he wanted, then leave no trace; tap into a line and sniff data packets; take snapshots of any target. He was formerly of the North Korean intelligence service and with the knack to pass himself off as Japanese, but he dropped out as someone offered him better pay and asked him to infiltrate NERV. More specifically, they initially wanted him to keep an eye on Ryouji Kaji.  
哦，他杀起人来就像一条毫不犹豫的眼镜蛇；悄无声息地潜入，拿走他想要的一切，然后不留痕迹；接入一条线路嗅探数据包；对任何目标进行快照。他曾是朝鲜情报机构的一员，并擅长伪装成日本人，但有人给了他更高的报酬，让他渗透进 NERV。更具体地说，他们最初是想让他监视 Ryouji Kaji。

So he did, befriending the guy (Kaji's damn cool, really) at work and in the field, and began feeding information and vice-versa to gain much trust from the spy.  
于是他照做了，在工作和任务中与 Kaji（那家伙真的很酷）交朋友，开始交换信息以建立信任，反过来也从间谍那里获取信息。

However, Kaji knew too much about what was going on behind the scenes, the things that most people don't want to hear about or ignore at their leisure. So when his new employers realized that he was a liability after an apparent abduction incident involving Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, Kaji had to be eliminated before he could blow everything wide-open.  
然而，Kaji 对幕后发生的事情了如指掌，那些大多数人不愿听或随意忽视的事情。因此，当他的新雇主意识到他在副指挥官 Fuyutsuki 的明显绑架事件后成了一个累赘时，必须在 Kaji 揭开一切之前将他除掉。

He remembered in detail the last minute Kaji was alive at the AHU (air-conditioning and heating unit) room. Friendly smile on his face, exhaust fan spinning behind his back. Didn't think of the silenced pistol the killer whipped out in a half-second and fired before Kaji could finish his greeting. The smell of freshly-burnt gunpowder, the blood spreading on the floor under Kaji's corpse, and that surprised look of a man bushwhacked.  
他清晰地记得在 AHU（空调和供暖单元）房间里，加治活着的最后一分钟。他脸上挂着友好的微笑，背后的排气扇旋转着。没想到杀手在半秒内掏出消音手枪并开火，加治还没来得及打完招呼就倒下了。新鲜的火药味，加治尸体下蔓延的血迹，以及那张被突袭的惊讶面孔。

Now he was waiting for his next assignment, after that last week when he took snapshots of Rei Ayanami leaving her apartment with a telephoto lens screwed to his camera. Girl looked pretty, but with no expression, and judging from her daily habits, she was always on time down to the exact second that he could set his watch to her routine. It also struck him as odd that she still wore a school uniform, even as the local junior high school complex was now nothing but a pile of rubble.  
现在他正等待着下一个任务，就在上周，他用装有长焦镜头的相机拍下了绫波零离开公寓的照片。女孩看起来很漂亮，但面无表情，从她的日常习惯来看，她总是准时到秒，以至于他都可以根据她的作息来对表。也让他感到奇怪的是，尽管当地的初中校园如今已成废墟，她仍穿着校服。

Just as he was on the final bits of rice in his bento, picking each with chopsticks, the phone rang.  
正当他用筷子挑着便当里最后几粒米饭时，电话响了。

"Yeah," the killer said, pressing a button on his earset. "It's me again."  
“是啊，”杀手说着，按下了耳机的按钮，“又是我。”

"I have a new job for you," the caller answered in a deep voice, garbled by the scrambler on the other side.  
“我有个新任务给你，”电话那头的人用低沉的声音回答，声音因另一端的加密器而变得模糊不清。

"Go ahead."

"To speed up our timetable, we would like to have a target taken out of the picture, a huge liability for our project. I'll send you some details right now."  
“为了加快我们的时间表，我们需要除掉一个目标，他对于我们的项目是个巨大的隐患。我现在就把详细信息发给你。”

Immediately, the caller sent to his notebook an email with two dozen files attached. The killer checked the files, skimming through them, before he came upon several pictures of his intended target.  
随即，来电者向他的笔记本发送了一封带有二十多个附件的电子邮件。杀手检查了这些文件，快速浏览后，发现了数张他预定目标的照片。

"Nice, just nice," the killer commented. "You want me to waste a vegetable?"  
“不错，正合我意，”杀手评论道。“你想让我干掉一个植物人？”

"This mission is necessary," the caller replied with no humor in his voice. "But you'll only do it later this week. We'll leave you the required tools by tomorrow. Same place and time, and the usual fee, and of course you'll also get an advance. Be on standby should we see any changes in the situation and we'll make the necessary adjustments. We'll give you a green light when the target is ready."  
“这项任务是必要的，”来电者毫无幽默感地回答。“但你要等到本周晚些时候才行动。明天我们会把所需工具留在老地方，老时间，以及惯常的费用，当然你还会提前收到一部分。保持待命状态，如有情况变化我们会进行必要的调整。目标准备就绪时，我们会给你开绿灯。”

The killer nodded with pleasure. "Hmmmm… No sweat. I can make it look like an accident."  
杀手满意地点头。“嗯……没问题。我可以把它弄成意外事故。”

"Thank you. As always, deliver the best results and be careful out there. Good luck." The line was now cut off in the killer's ear.  
“谢谢。一如既往，拿出最好的结果，在外面小心点。祝你好运。”电话在杀手耳边挂断了。

The killer sighed, now anticipating for his next masterpiece as he rubbed both hands. _Gonna be busy,_ he thought. _Gonna get busy and do it right._  
杀手叹了口气，搓着双手，期待着他的下一个杰作。他会很忙，他想。会忙起来，并且做得对。

**Author's Notes:** Sorry if it has taken me _six years_ to get back into writing, as I had more than my fair share of personal problems to deal with. Six years is _too long_ for a writer's block.  
作者笔记：如果花了六年时间才重新开始写作，对此我深感抱歉，因为我遇到了不少个人问题。六年时间对写作障碍来说太长了。

By the way, if you've noticed the altered tone, length and flow of this chapter, it's because I'm making up for so much time lost, using a new writing style and indentation, with better detail and more dialogue, hence the designation of "Season Two" to distinguish itself from the first 8 chapters; it's like you're getting 16:9 high-def OVA-grade reading right now, compared to standard 4:3.  
顺便一提，如果你注意到这篇chapter的语调、长度和流畅度有所改变，那是因为我在弥补失去的时间，采用了新的写作风格和缩进方式，增加了更多的细节和对话，因此将其命名为“第二季”，以区别于前八章；现在的阅读体验就像是从标准 4:3 升级到了 16:9 高清 OVA 级别。

Furthermore I had to do a crash refresher course on Eva lore, while at the same time try to incorporate few features of the recent Eva high-def revamps (with the exception of the new _meganekko_ character). Finally, we're beginning to see a divergence from the original Episode 24 storyline.  
此外，我还不得不临时抱佛脚地复习一下《EVA》的背景知识，同时试图融入一些近期高清重制版的新特性（除了新加入的眼镜娘角色）。最终，我们开始看到与原版第 24 集剧情线的偏离。

This chapter dedicated to my late parents. Thank you all, and I'm determined to finish this.  
此篇chapter献给我已故的父母。感谢大家，我决心完成它。

### Chapter 10 Red Flag

Back at home, Misato was staring at a line graph generated on her computer, which showed comparisons of different sync ratios of Kaworu and the other Children. Being a bit forgetful, she stuck a Post-It on the side of the monitor that she should report to Fuyutsuki at eight 'o clock in the morning, and maybe try to budge him to release Asuka as soon as possible.  
回到家中，美里盯着电脑上生成的折线图，比较着渚薰与其他孩子们的不同同步率。她有些健忘，于是在显示器旁贴了一张便签，提醒自己明早八点向冬月报告，并尝试说服他尽快释放明日香。

On a spreadsheet, she processed the raw data that Makoto Hyuga copied and sent her the previous afternoon, crunched it through some formulas, until she got this graph: The sync ratio was on the X-axis, the time length at the Y-axis, and each line represented the Children in a distinct color. Their data resulted in very shallow, occasional dips and rises, which was normal. None of the lines exceeded around 60 percent of sync ratio.  
在电子表格上，她处理了昨天下午碇真嗣复制并发送给她的原始数据，通过一些公式计算，最终得到了这张图表：同步率在 X 轴上，时间长度在 Y 轴上，每条线代表一个孩子，颜色各异。他们的数据显示出浅浅的、偶尔的起伏，这是正常的。没有任何一条线的同步率超过大约 60%。

However, once again it was only Kaworu's sync ratio data that set him far apart from all the other Children, no matter how Misato even entered other sets of the Children's test data gathered from different times as comparisons: his sync ratio showed it steadying low at 20 percent, then skyrocketing between 70 to 90 percent, before falling back to 5 percent, just as Makoto explained previously.  
然而，又一次只有渚薰的同步率数据将他与其他所有孩子们远远区分开来，无论美里甚至加入了其他时期收集的孩子们的测试数据进行比较：他的同步率显示稳定在 20%，然后飙升至 70%到 90%之间，最后回落到 5%，正如真琴之前解释的那样。

_It's another red flag_, Misato concluded, imagining that if Ritsuko were to see his data for herself, the blonde scientist would spill her coffee over her lap in shock.  
这又是一个危险信号，美里得出结论，想象着如果律子亲自看到他的数据，这位金发科学家会震惊到把咖啡洒在腿上。

Shinji was alone and sleepless in his bed, the young man staring at the ceiling while the midnight breeze blew into the bedroom. Despite the earlier reunion with his friends, by now his euphoria was worn off, to be replaced by thoughts of Rei.  
真嗣独自躺在床上，无法入眠，年轻人凝视着天花板，而午夜的微风轻轻吹进卧室。尽管之前与朋友们重聚，但此刻他的兴奋已经消退，取而代之的是对绫波的思念。

As an afterthought, he glanced at his left hand and recalled about the strange thing that happened when he tried to wrestle the Angel off from Unit-01. The creature also destroyed his Pallet Assault Rifle and came up upon him like a jungle python entangling a hunter; the hunter became the hunted.  
事后回想起来，他瞥了一眼自己的左手，想起了试图从零号机上摔下使徒时发生的奇怪事情。那生物还毁了他的色带突击步枪，像丛林蟒蛇缠绕猎人一样向他袭来；猎人变成了猎物。

Shinji imagined the Angel manifested itself on the back of his hand, by a creeping sensation accompanied with some veins growing under the glove of his plug suit. He saw it grow, and it sprouted miniature _heads_ of Rei, like it wanted him to be absorbed.  
真嗣想象着使徒在他手背上显现，伴随着一种爬行的感觉和插头服手套下生长的静脉。他看到它生长，长出了迷你版的绫波丽头部，仿佛想要吞噬他。

Yes, it pulsed with life and it really hurt like hellfire as it tried to infest him, even as he jammed the Prog Knife into the Angel's body. He wanted to scream but he could not as he watched the damned thing grow in his hand, his eyes widening in terror before he thought he heard the Angel talking to him:  
是的，它充满生机地跳动着，试图侵入他时痛苦如地狱之火，即使他将程序刀插入使徒体内。他想尖叫却发不出声，眼看着那该死的东西在他手中生长，惊恐地睁大眼睛，随后他觉得自己听到了使徒在对他说话：

"_It hurts so well, doesn't it Ikari?"_  
"痛并快乐着，不是吗，碇君？"

He could also recall how the Angel seemed to giggle as he struggled to stop this luminous python from going into him any further until Rei painfully whispered some of her last thoughts through the comlink:  
他还能记起那个使徒似乎在窃笑，当他挣扎着阻止这条发光的巨蟒进一步侵入自己时，绫波痛苦地通过通讯器低语出她最后的思绪：

"_Is this my heart... to be one with Ikari...? NO!"_  
"这是我的心...与碇君合而为一...？不！"

And he saw everything turn to a blur, as the Angel instantly let go of Shinji and Unit-01 and snaked itself towards Rei and Unit-00. Like a bullet, the Angel slammed straight into that Eva's chest and buried itself into the core. Once it became one with the Eva, the core imploded with a large glob of pink coming out... before it shrank back into Unit-00.  
他看到一切变得模糊，天使瞬间放开了真嗣和初号机，蜿蜒向丽和零号机袭去。如同子弹一般，天使直撞入那台 EVA 的胸膛，深深埋入核心。一旦与 EVA 合为一体，核心便内爆，一大团粉色物质喷涌而出……随后又缩回零号机体内。

With his eyes widened in shock, Shinji saw Unit-00 slowly rose from its feet, its right hand reaching for the sky. For a split second it shed off its blue and white exoskeleton armor, took the pink shape of a woman's body and then the next thing he witnessed was a massive fireball that ripped up the city in half.  
真嗣瞪大眼睛，震惊地看着零号机缓缓站起，右手指向天空。一瞬间，它褪去了蓝白色的外骨骼装甲，化作一个女人身体的粉色形态，紧接着他所目睹的是一个巨大的火球，将城市一分为二。

By instinct, Shinji shielded his eyes from the glare of the blast, the shockwave hitting hard on Unit-01, and didn't peer outward until he opened his eyes... and the landscape was changed irrevocably from a skyline of concrete into a giant, steaming hole in the ground, slowly filling up with water. As he stared at the crater, Shinji wondered if Rei could survive an explosion this destructive until she told him later at the Infirmary that she was the Third.  
出于本能，真嗣用手护住眼睛，躲避爆炸的强光，冲击波重重地击打在初号机上，直到他睁开眼向外看去……眼前的景象已彻底改变，从一片混凝土构成的天际线变成了一个巨大的、冒着热气的大坑，坑中正缓缓注满水。凝视着这个弹坑，真嗣不禁疑惑，丽能否在这种破坏力的爆炸中幸存，直到后来在医务室她告诉他，她是第三号。

But to him she was the last of her kind, after he saw Ritsuko destroy the other Reis with a remote control in her hand. In her eyes was a combination of rage, disgust and self-loathing. All three of them were in the Dummy Plug Plant, and Ritsuko showed them the dark secret of the First Children.  
但在他看来，她是同类中的最后一个，因为他亲眼目睹了律子用遥控器摧毁了其他丽。她的眼中混合着愤怒、厌恶和自我憎恨。他们三人都在模拟插件工厂里，律子向他们展示了第一适格者的黑暗秘密。

As they were in the large vat of LCL, the facsimiles of the First Child disintegrated into pieces. In a flash, their heads and limbs were torn away not unlike paper dolls, their bodies dissolving into flecks of flesh, internal organs, and even an eyeball popping from its socket. All of those spilled out and the amber liquid was diluted with the blood of the needlessly condemned.  
当他们身处巨大的 LCL 容器中时，第一适格者的复制品碎裂成片。一瞬间，他们的头颅和四肢被撕裂，就像纸娃娃一样，身体溶解成肉屑、内脏，甚至有一颗眼球从眼窝中弹出。所有这些都散落出来，琥珀色的液体被那些无辜受刑者的鲜血所稀释。

This slaughterhouse sight was definitely he couldn't take anymore, causing Shinji to instantly drop on his knees and wretch, his bile rising up to his mouth. While he gagged onto the floor, vomiting what was left of his lunch, Shinji heard Ritsuko's lament towards a shaken Misato as she wept, dropping the remote control gadget from her grip.  
这屠宰场的景象实在是让他无法再忍受，使得真嗣立刻跪倒在地，呕吐起来，胆汁涌上喉咙。他一边趴在地上，吐出剩下的午餐，一边听到律子对着颤抖的美里哭泣，手中的遥控器从指间滑落。

"_...I'm really stupid... I'm so fucking stupid as my mother! Misato... I was made a goddamned fool and played around with!"_  
"...我真的太蠢了...我简直和我妈一样蠢！美里...我成了个该死的傻瓜，被玩弄于股掌之间！"

Now Shinji looked at his left hand once again, before he thought of this insanity made by his father was all about. He sighed.  
现在，真嗣再次看向他的左手，思考着父亲制造的这场疯狂究竟是为了什么。他叹了口气。

"I'm not the only one suffering, am I right?" he asked himself, realizing that even the two older women in his life had their own demons to face.  
"我并不是唯一受苦的人，对吧？" 他自问，意识到他生命中的两位年长女性也各自有要面对的心魔。

On the shores of Lake Ashinoko, surrounded by rubble and collapsed buildings, Kaworu scanned the landscape, his eyes adjusting to the near-darkness. He wanted to make sure that nobody was following him, and in the last half-hour of walking all the way here he glanced over his back several times. The night sky was powdered with stars, and there was little wind at the moment.  
在芦之湖畔，四周尽是瓦砾与倒塌的建筑物，渚薰环视着这片近乎黑暗的景象，双眼逐渐适应了环境。他想确认是否有人在跟踪他，在过去的半小时里，他一路走来，多次回头张望。夜空中点缀着繁星，此刻几乎没有风。

It was clear that there was no other soul within a radius of about five kilometers from where he was standing.  
显然，在他所站立的地方方圆五公里内，没有其他人的踪迹。

With great caution, Kaworu took a deep breath, and the toe of his shoes touched the water. Then he made another step, until he was now levitating above the lake's surface using his AT-Field. Kaworu willed himself to go forward.  
渚薰极为谨慎地深吸一口气，鞋尖轻触水面。随后，他又迈出一步，利用 AT 力场悬浮于湖面之上。渚薰心中默念，驱动自己向前行进。

He went on floating away from the shore until he found a cluster of shattered ferroconcrete pillars and slabs above the water, remnants of one of Tokyo-3's towering condenser units prior to Unit-00's destruction. He placed the backpack onto one of the slabs.  
他继续漂离岸边，直到发现水面上散落着一堆破碎的钢筋混凝土柱和板，这是东京-3 一座高耸冷凝塔在零号机破坏前的遗迹。他将背包放在其中一块板上。

Kaworu took out his phone from the bag. It was a satellite phone with full encryption, disguised as a regular clamshell cellular phone, and would only hook up to SEELE-controlled communication satellites. The sunglasses that Kaworu now also wore were holographic display glasses that can connect wirelessly with that special phone. Now he turned on both gadgets.  
薰从包里拿出手机。这是一部具有全加密功能的卫星电话，伪装成普通的翻盖手机，只能连接 SEELE 控制的通信卫星。薰现在戴的太阳镜是能与这部特殊手机无线连接的全息显示眼镜。现在他打开了这两样设备。

Using his transit data and orbital coordinates, he located the communication satellite he wanted and began tuning the phone to its specific frequency. He could now hear a chime from the gadget, confirming a good satellite uplink.  
利用他的中转数据和轨道坐标，他定位到了想要的那颗通信卫星，并开始将手机调至其特定频率。现在，他能听到设备发出的提示音，确认了与卫星的良好连接。

Through his glasses, the monoliths slowly "emerge" from out of the air, until he could see that they surrounded him completely. All of them with watching eyes, and as he pivoted around, Kaworu could imagine their ancient faces behind those monoliths, each with a glowing red number.  
透过他的眼镜，那些巨石缓缓地“浮现”在空气中，直到他能看清它们完全包围了他。每一块巨石都带着注视的眼睛，当他转身环顾时，碇真嗣可以想象那些巨石背后古老的面孔，每一个都闪烁着红色的数字。

Kaworu now faced the monolith that called itself SEELE 01: Keel Lorenz, the Chairman of the Instrumentality Committee.  
碇真嗣现在面对着自称是 SEELE 01 的巨石：基尔·洛伦兹，人类补完委员会的主席。

"Good evening," Kaworu greeted. "I know that you are expecting me, sir."  
“晚上好，”碇真嗣问候道，“我知道您在等我，先生。”

"Do you have anything to report since your arrival?" SEELE 01 asked.  
"自你到达以来，有什么要报告的吗？" SEELE 01 问道。

Kaworu nodded. "I do."  
渚薰点头。"我有。"

"Very well," SEELE 01 said. "Before we proceed, let us remind you that you are being watched. Understood?  
"很好，" SEELE 01 说。"在我们继续之前，让我们提醒你，你正被监视。明白吗？

"Yes, sir, I acknowledge that."  
"是的，先生，我承认这一点。"

"Let us begin hearing what you have gleaned from NERV."  
"让我们开始听听你从 NERV 那里了解到的情况吧。"

In formal language worthy of a presentation of an annual business report, the Fifth Children narrated about his first two days at NERV. He mentioned that he underwent a physical examination, had an initial sync test, a combat readiness test on the simulator, before he discussed about the people he met. But as Kaworu promised himself, he intentionally left out the juicier details, telling the SEELE men what they _wanted_ to hear, choosing his words carefully as he went.  
用一种堪比年度商业报告的正式语言，第五适格者叙述了他在 NERV 的头两天。他提到自己接受了体检，进行了初次同步测试，以及在模拟器上的战斗准备测试，然后才谈到了他遇到的人。但正如碇真嗣对自己承诺的那样，他故意省略了更引人入胜的细节，只告诉 SEELE 的成员他们想听的内容，字斟句酌地选择着言辞。

Near the end of his report, Keel Lorenz asked Kaworu, "What is your impression regarding the First Children?"  
在他的报告接近尾声时，基尔·洛伦兹问渚薰：“你对初号机的孩子们有什么印象？”

Kaworu shook his head. "She remains as she is, just as reported. No emotions, no past, and she will exist for the Commander's purposes, even if she is no longer the Pilot of Unit Zero."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“她依旧如报告所述，没有情感，没有过去，她将为了司令官的目的而存在，即使她不再是零号机的驾驶员。”

"What about the Second Children?" Keel questioned, referring to Asuka.  
“那二号机的孩子们呢？”基尔问道，指的是明日香。

"Because of her psychological trauma, there will be no future for her outside Project E, nor would she ever be able to recover from her ordeal, as the Commander will decide her fate."  
"由于她的心理创伤，她在‘E 计划’之外不会有未来，也无法从她的苦难中恢复，因为指挥官将决定她的命运。"

"Hmmm… and is there anything about the Fourth Children?"  
"嗯……那关于第四适格者有什么消息吗？"

"They were forced to amputate his damaged limbs and therefore he is medically grounded," Kaworu reported.  
"他们被迫截去了他受损的四肢，因此他现在因医疗原因无法执行任务，" 渚报告道。"

"So, he is no longer in the picture, and that leaves the Third Children to remain, is that correct?"  
“这么说，他已经不在了，剩下的就是第三适格者，对吗？”

Kaworu nodded. 渚薰点了点头。

He could then hear a faint condescending snort from behind Keel's monolith.  
随后，他听到从基尔的巨石背后传来一声轻微的、带有轻蔑意味的哼声。

"Time and again Commander Ikari pushes and manipulates everyone around him to do his work," Keel lectured, "even cowards and lunatics, as long as he thinks that they are valuable to him to further his aims, until they are no longer useful. I still find it funny that he carries no guilt in the things he do, whether it involves men, women or children, that he is constantly stubborn as a bull against a hundred bullfighters. This behavior is also costing us our time and money."  
“一次次地，碇司令推动并操纵他周围的人为他工作，”基尔训斥道，“哪怕是懦夫和疯子，只要他认为他们对他实现目标有价值，直到他们不再有用。我仍然觉得好笑，他对自己所做的事情毫无愧疚，无论是涉及男人、女人还是孩子，他总是像一头面对百名斗牛士的公牛一样固执。这种行为也在消耗我们的时间和金钱。”

Kaworu said nothing, and as the whole SEELE council was eyeballing his every move and gesture by their spy satellite's ultra-resolution IR video camera, he kept his feelings in check, his face remaining neutral and indifferent. However, for the Fifth Children this might also be the first time the Chairman has become very blunt, as the elder's stress related to the Human Complementation Project has risen in direct proportion to a dwindling amount of time.  
薰没有说话，整个 SEELE 议会通过间谍卫星的超高分辨率红外摄像机密切监视着他的一举一动，他控制住自己的情绪，面无表情，漠不关心。然而，对于第五适格者来说，这可能是主席第一次变得非常直白，因为与人类补完计划相关的压力随着时间的减少而直接上升。

Now Kaworu knew that he has only five days left to finish the job.  
现在，渚薰知道他只剩下五天时间来完成这项任务。

"Before you go," Keel said, breaking the silence. "Never once we doubted your abilities, young man. You always raised our confidence and gave us hope."  
"在你离开之前，"基尔说，打破了沉默。"我们从未怀疑过你的能力，年轻人。你总是提升我们的信心，给予我们希望。"

Kaworu smiled. "Thank you, sir. It is my pleasure."  
渚薰微笑道："谢谢您，先生。这是我的荣幸。"

"Now that we are pleased with your progress, we would like you to continue on with your duty," Keel answered. "We can feel that the day is coming for our benefit, and once you fulfill your destiny, all of us will have our reward."  
"既然我们对你的进步感到满意，我们希望你能继续履行你的职责，"基尔回答。"我们能感觉到那一天即将到来，为我们带来利益，一旦你完成你的使命，我们所有人都会得到回报。"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, sir… I will not fail you all."  
渚薰点头。“是的，先生……我不会让你们失望的。”

"Well then, we wish you good luck. You can go now, Mister Nagisa."  
“那么，我们祝你好运。你可以走了，渚先生。”

The monoliths immediately "vanished" from Kaworu's presence, and after a moment the Fifth Children took off his holographic glasses.  
那些巨石碑立刻在渚薰面前“消失”，片刻后，第五适格者摘下了他的全息眼镜。

He could breathe easy now. It was over.  
他现在可以轻松呼吸了。一切都结束了。

The man that Keel Lorenz described as a "stubborn bull" examined his left palm, swathed heavily in bandages, knowing that the power of the creature embedded in it would be harnessed later. He was restless with a brain still running at full tilt, even at this early hour of the morning, a man out to get even at fate for the loss of his wife.  
基尔·洛伦兹口中的“倔强公牛”审视着他那被厚厚绷带包裹的左掌，深知其中嵌入的生物之力将在未来被利用。尽管已是清晨时分，他仍心神不宁，大脑高速运转，誓要向命运讨回失去妻子的公道。

Sitting on the side of his bed and wearing only a pair of boxer shorts, Gendo Ikari was fresh out of surgery and right now he was back in his private quarters, located somewhere in Central Dogma.  
坐在床边，只穿着一条拳击短裤的碇源堂刚做完手术，此刻他回到了位于中央教条区某处的私人房间。

However, only a few people were privileged to enter, including Ritsuko Akagi, as his sleeping and living quarters were a very stark contrast to the opulent, expansive office occupying the top floor of the NERV headquarters pyramid: this was a complete, repelling mess, and the air inside was a mixed miasma of cigarette smoke, sweat, and dust.  
然而，只有少数人有幸进入这里，包括赤木律子，因为他的卧室和起居室与 NERV 总部金字塔顶层那间豪华宽敞的办公室形成了鲜明对比：这里一片狼藉，空气中混杂着香烟烟雾、汗水和灰尘的混合气息。

This clutter was also a product of Gendo's single-minded personality over the years as he pursued his Holy Grail, evidence of his impatience.  
这种杂乱也是碇源堂多年来一心追求圣杯的单一性格的产物，显示出他的不耐烦。

Walls with bookshelves were packed with thousands of scientific and mystical tomes (mostly on the Kabbala); around his bed and against some of the walls were stacks of books, publications, folders and envelopes. His clothes were on hangers, with at least two more dangling from the ceiling lamp. His large desk was occupied by two computer monitors and a keyboard, but stuffed with more paper. Finally the wastebasket besides the desk was overflowing with crumpled balls of paper and empty cans of UCC Coffee.  
墙壁上装满书架，堆满了数千本科学与神秘学著作（大多关于卡巴拉）；床边和部分墙边堆放着书籍、出版物、文件夹和信封。他的衣物挂在衣架上，至少还有两个从天花板灯上垂挂下来。他的大书桌上摆放着两台电脑显示器和一个键盘，但更多的是塞满了纸张。最后，书桌旁的废纸篓里满是皱巴巴的纸团和空了的 UCC 咖啡罐。

But all of it no longer mattered to Gendo as long as he possessed Adam: he would soon proclaim himself a god over all others, and his time of supremacy would be forthcoming.  
但对源度来说，只要他拥有亚当，这一切都不再重要：他很快就会自封为众神之神，他的统治时代即将到来。

With the idea still fresh in his mind, Gendo Ikari went to his desk and began writing down the memo of his proposal to restart the Dummy Plug program. He must seize the day and the opportunity presented by Kaworu Nagisa.  
这个想法仍新鲜地留在他的脑海中，源度·伊卡里前往书桌，开始写下重启傀儡插头计划的备忘录。他必须抓住当下和川濑真嗣提供的机会。

Deep within the bowels of the Stockade, a baton's loud crash upon the steel door woke up Ritsuko Akagi with a start from her iron cot. She could see that a guard was peeking inside. The growing smell of her body odor also permeated the whole cell, a by-product of her prolonged detention.  
在禁闭室深处，警棍重重敲击在钢门上的巨响，将碇唯从铁床上猛然惊醒。她看到一名狱警正透过门缝窥视。随着时间的推移，她身上的体臭味也逐渐弥漫了整个牢房，这是她长时间被拘留的副产品。

"Damn it, I'm still sleeping," she complained loudly, staring angrily at the CCTV camera aimed below at her, as the guard opened the door. "What do you want?"  
“该死，我还在睡觉呢，”她大声抱怨着，愤怒地盯着下方对准她的监控摄像头，狱警打开了门。“你想要什么？”

Wordlessly, the guard handed her a packed plastic bag, which she opened and dumped its contents onto her cot: they included a set of light green prisoner jumpsuits, slippers, spare underwear, a towel, and toiletries – soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and deodorant in a single pack. After for so long wearing her now-soiled duty uniform for days, stinking by the hour, without a change since her arrest, at last there was sanitary relief.  
狱警一言不发地递给她一个塑料袋，她打开后将里面的东西倒在床上：包括一套浅绿色的囚服、拖鞋、备用内衣、毛巾以及洗漱用品——肥皂、洗发水、牙膏和除臭剂被打包在一起。自从被捕以来，她已经连续多日穿着那件脏污的制服，每况愈下，如今终于有了卫生上的缓解。

_Get used to the new routine,_ Ritsuko thought, scolding herself. _Sooner or later that bastard Gendo will have his karma._  
适应新的日常吧，律子想，暗自责备自己。迟早那个混蛋源堂会得到报应的。

"Good morning. As this is our offer for you to be a little more comfortable, you'd better take a shower and wear it, Doctor," the guard said. "We'll also have to hose down your cell as you fix yourself and get some breakfast."  
“早上好。这是我们为您提供的，让您更舒适一些的安排，您最好去洗个澡并换上它，博士，”守卫说道。“同时，我们还得在你整理自己和吃早餐的时候冲洗一下你的牢房。”

Ritsuko sighed. "Ah, okay," she agreed with self-sarcasm as she stood up and carried the bag. "I look like crap, and I also smell like crap. What's on the menu today, soldier?"  
律子叹了口气。“啊，好吧，”她带着自我嘲讽地同意道，站起身来拿起袋子。“我看起来糟糕，闻起来也糟糕。今天菜单上有什么，士兵？”

"Beef yakudon with miso soup on the side, if you like, ma'am," the guard replied. "By the way, if you wanted to know, it's five o'clock in the morning."  
"如果您喜欢的话，牛肉丼饭配味噌汤，女士。" 警卫回答道，"顺便说一下，如果您想知道的话，现在是早上五点。"

As Ritsuko, plastic bag in tow, following the guard on their way to the shower room, she worried of the duties that were forcibly taken away from her. _I hope that Natsumi knows what she's doing, and that Maya works on the MAGI properly; I can't afford a hardware breakdown._  
丽津子拖着塑料袋，跟在警卫后面前往淋浴间，心中担忧那些被强行夺走的职责。希望夏美知道自己在做什么，真希能妥善操作 MAGI；我可承受不起硬件故障。

_Well,_ Ritsuko added, _at least finally I get to be squeaky-clean while behind bars._  
嗯，丽津子补充道，至少终于能在铁窗后变得一尘不染了。

By around six o'clock, the Katsuragi residence began to stir to life, as Shinji began the day by turning on the TV for the morning news, swept the floor, cooked some breakfast, before he went to Misato's bedroom. He found her dozing on the desk, head resting upon arms before the computer monitor. There were also two empty cans of UCC coffee and a barely-empty bag of Doritos, as it was clear she worked all night.  
大约六点钟，葛城家开始苏醒，真嗣先是打开电视收看晨间新闻，然后扫地，做早餐，之后他去了美里小姐的卧室。他发现她趴在桌子上打盹，头枕在手臂上，面前是电脑显示器。桌上还有两个空的 UCC 咖啡罐和一袋几乎空了的多力多滋薯片，显然她通宵工作了一整夜。

He shook her gently on the shoulder to wake up.  
他轻轻摇了摇她的肩膀，试图唤醒她。

"Mmmmm…," Misato groaned, trying to open her eyes. "What's for breakfast?"  
“嗯……”美里呻吟着，努力睁开眼睛。“早餐吃什么？”

Shinji shrugged. "The usual fried eggs and fish," he said, "Good morning to you, anyway."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“还是煎蛋和鱼，”他说，“总之，早上好。”

"Timeisit?" she asked in a sleepy voice.  
"几点了？" 她用睡意朦胧的声音问道。

Shinji glanced at the wall clock. "It's almost seven. Come on and get up," he answered.  
真嗣瞥了一眼墙上的时钟。"快七点了。起来吧，" 他回答道。

Misato stared at the reminder stuck to the monitor, and nodded. "All right, we've got some work to do today," she decided as she stood up and stretched with her arms, yawning wide open.  
美里盯着贴在显示器上的提醒条，点了点头。“好吧，今天我们有些工作要做，”她一边说着，一边站起身来，伸了个懒腰，打了个大大的哈欠。

As always, Rei Ayanami was in her usual punctual self, and the sentries at Gate 18 knew that they could set their watches to her daily routine of showing the ID card and going through the turnstile. Thus they gave her a secret nickname: Clockwork Ayanami.  
一如既往，绫波零准时如常，第 18 号门的哨兵们知道，她的日常就是出示身份证，通过旋转门，他们私下给她起了个绰号：发条零。

While one sentry inspected her ID card, another guard picked up a ringing phone and answered it.  
一名哨兵检查她的身份证时，另一名警卫接起响起的电话并应答。

But as she passed through the turnstile and was about to board one of the elevators, one of the guards called out her name as he ran towards her.  
但当她穿过旋转门，正要登上其中一部电梯时，一名警卫一边向她跑来，一边喊出了她的名字。

"What is it?" Rei inquired.  
“什么事？”丽询问道。

"Commander Ikari wants your presence immediately," the guard replied.  
“碇司令要你立刻过去，”警卫回答。

Kaworu's breakfast at the cafeteria consisted of rice, miso soup and tea. As he ate, Kaworu wondered if everything was on schedule, but still the unexpected could always happen, even with the best intentions. Last night's first report went well, but he felt that he would probably gain nothing from trying to use the meeting as a way to ask hard questions about Rei and everything else, and even then SEELE would keep silence; they presumably wanted to say anything that can only please their ears.  
在食堂，渚薰的早餐包括米饭、味噌汤和茶。他一边吃，一边思索着一切是否按计划进行，但即便是最周密的安排，也难免会有意外发生。昨晚的第一次报告进行得很顺利，但他觉得试图利用这次会议来提出关于绫波和其他事情的尖锐问题可能不会有什么收获，即便如此，Seele 也会保持沉默；他们大概只想听到那些能取悦他们耳朵的话。

He remembered yesterday's lunch and overheard Fuyutsuki inviting Misato to report to his office today. Perhaps they may discuss something mundane, but it could be everything critical, especially at this moment as Fuyutsuki was greatly concerned at NERV's situation.  
他记得昨天的午餐，无意中听到冬月邀请美里今天去他办公室汇报。或许他们会讨论些琐事，但也可能是至关重要的事，尤其是在这个时刻，冬月对 NERV 的状况极为忧心。

Just as he was about to finish his meal, a man in a three-piece suit, presumably one of the Second Section agents, approached him.  
正当他准备结束用餐时，一个穿着三件套西装的男人，大概是第二课的特工，朝他走了过来。

"You're Mister Kaworu Nagisa, the Fifth Children?" the agent asked.  
"您就是渚薰先生，第五适格者吗？" 特工问道。

Kaworu turned to him and answered, "Yes."  
渚薰转向他，回答道："是的。"

"The Commander would like to see you at his office."  
"指挥官希望在办公室见您。"

_Svengali,_ Kaworu muttered in his thoughts.  
斯文加利，薰在心中默念。

As Misato was driving with Shinji, her cellphone went off with a loud ring. The young man pressed the phone's hands-free mode button, as Misato was on the steering wheel and didn't want to be distracted, while dodging massive Komatsu dump trucks roaring in the middle of the road as they hauled away concrete slabs of Tokyo-3 debris.  
当美里和真嗣驾车行驶时，她的手机突然响起了刺耳的铃声。年轻人按下了手机的免提键，因为美里正握着方向盘，不想分心，同时还要躲避在路中央轰鸣而过的巨大 Komatsu 自卸卡车，这些卡车正运载着东京-3 的废墟混凝土板。

"It's the Sub-Commander," Shinji reported, reading off the caller ID on the phone.  
“是副司令，”真嗣报告道，看着手机上的来电显示。

"Is that you, sir?" Misato answered.  
“是您吗，长官？”美里接起电话问道。

"This is Fuyutsuki here. I'm afraid there's a change of plans because Commander Ikari wants me up there for an urgent discussion."  
"这里是冬月。恐怕计划有变，因为碇司令要我上去进行一次紧急讨论。"

Misato grimaced, as she noticed a frantic note in Fuyutsuki's voice. "Just great," she muttered. "What is it all about?"  
美里皱了皱眉，她注意到冬月声音中的慌乱。“真是糟糕，”她低声抱怨，“这都是关于什么的？”

"I don't know, but I think he's up to something very big, and still I have a very bad feeling about it," Fuyutsuki answered.  
"我不清楚，但我觉得他正在策划一件非常大的事，而且我对此有种非常不好的预感，”冬月回答道。"

Misato could also hear some paper being shuffled around in the background. Fuyutsuki was probably filing or signing away everything on his desk. "Why, sir?" she inquired.  
真嗣也能听到背景中纸张翻动的声音。也许冬月正在整理或签署桌上的文件。“为什么，先生？”她询问道。

"Asides from me, he also called in Nagisa and Ayanami. However, I can't explain much right now. Now, I must go, Major. You two have to wait at my office instead," Fuyutsuki replied, before the line went dead.  
“除了我，他还叫来了渚和绫波。不过，我现在无法解释太多。现在，我必须挂了，真嗣。你们俩得在我的办公室等着，”冬月回答，随后电话就断了。

"More red flags," Misato grumbled.  
“又是红旗信号，”真嗣咕哝道。

"I don't understand, but why?" Shinji asked.  
"我不明白，但为什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Know what this rush means to you? I bet my left lung that your dad has a crazy new idea and is itching to revive a failed project."  
"你知道这种匆忙对你意味着什么吗？我敢用我的左肺打赌，你爸爸肯定有个疯狂的新点子，急着要重启一个失败的项目。"

In his massive office, Gendo Ikari faced Kozo Fuyutsuki and the two Children present, as they were his own idea of a highly acceptable audience that he could easily speak his mind to. He also now sported a very confident smirk on his face, signalling that there was a very grand idea on his brain. Fuyutsuki tried to keep his self-control intact; and Rei and Kaworu stood quietly, but they weren't aware that Gendo was now carrying Adam in his left palm, hidden by those white gloves.  
在他的巨大办公室里，碇源堂面对着副司令冬月耕造和在场的两名孩子，这是他认为非常合适的听众，可以轻松地表达自己的想法。他的脸上还带着非常自信的微笑，表明他脑海中有一个非常宏大的想法。冬月努力保持自制；绫波和渚则静静地站着，但他们并不知道碇源堂现在正将亚当藏在左手掌中，被白色手套遮住。

"Today I have made a very important decision," Gendo answered matter-of-factly. "This time we have the right opportunity and the factors to make it work once again." He promptly handed Fuyutsuki a folder containing his proposal.  
"今天我做出了一个非常重要的决定，" 碇源堂平静地回答，"这次我们有合适的机会和条件，能让它再次成功。" 他随即递给冬月一个文件夹，里面装着他的提案。

"What do you mean?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
"你是什么意思？" 冬月问道。

Gendo turned to face both Children.  
碇源堂转向面对两个孩子。

"The First Children must pass a compatibility test in Eva Unit One," Gendo declared. "The Fifth Children in Unit Two will also have his synchro data recorded in his own test, and keep an eye on the First Children. I propose that we rebuild the Dummy Plug."  
“初号机的适格者必须通过同步率测试，”碇源堂宣布，“二号机的第五适格者也要记录他的同步数据，并密切关注初号机的情况。我提议我们重建模拟插入栓。”

Inwardly, Kaworu was stunned. _The Dummy Plug?_  
内心深处，渚薰感到震惊。模拟插入栓？

Rei suddenly felt a chill in her spine, remembering the dead floating bits of her empty selves in the tank down at the Dummy Plug Plant.  
绫波零突然感到脊背发凉，回想起在模拟插入栓工厂下方水槽中漂浮的那些空洞自我的碎片。

Both Children tried not to look surprised, while Fuyutsuki was clearly thunderstruck, nearly dropping the folder. "You can't be serious," he mumbled loudly, "The whole scheme blew up in our faces, and I think it's not worth salvaging anymore."  
两位孩子尽量不显得惊讶，而冬月则明显被雷击中一般，差点把文件夹掉在地上。“你不是认真的吧，”他大声嘀咕道，“整个计划已经在我们脸上炸开了花，我觉得已经不值得再挽救了。”

Unpleased, Gendo gave him a defiant stare. "When I took this position," he defended, "I understand that in the process of scientific inquiry, and in the interest of our superiors, all possible risks must be dealt with, in order to accomplish our objectives. There is still much potential to be made if we could make use of the limited time we have right now."  
不悦之下，碇源堂给了他一个挑衅的眼神。“当我接受这个职位时，”他辩解道，“我明白在科学探索的过程中，为了我们上级的利益，必须处理所有可能的风险，以实现我们的目标。如果我们能利用现在有限的时机，还有很多潜力可以挖掘。”

Gendo was now hovering so close to Fuyutsuki's face, his nose no more than four inches away from the other, and the older man could even hear the heavy breathing, apparently trying to keep self-composure.  
碇源堂现在离冬月的脸如此之近，鼻子距离对方不过四英寸，年长的男人甚至能听到他沉重的呼吸声，显然是在努力保持自我镇定。

"And how can we prove that it's feasible this time?" Fuyutsuki countered, unfazed by the intimidating icy stare. "Do you have any idea that Unit One is still potentially unpredictable, even we've gone through many incidents involving it?"  
"我们这次如何证明它是可行的？" 副司令不畏那冰冷的目光，反问道，"你是否意识到初号机仍然存在潜在的不确定性，即便我们已经经历了多次与之相关的事件？"

"I know all of them, including those cases of rejection," Gendo answered, "but since she's ready again, I have full confidence in having this project revived. You may take it or leave it, but as I have obtained the favorable consensus of others involved, we will proceed as I have planned."  
"我了解所有情况，包括那些排斥反应的案例，" 碇源堂回答道，"但既然她已经准备好了，我对重启这个项目充满信心。你可以接受或拒绝，但既然我已经获得了其他相关人员的支持，我们将按照我的计划进行。"

Gendo then pivoted away from Fuyutsuki to confront the Children.  
碇源堂随后转身离开副司令，面对孩子们。

Wordlessly, Fuyutsuki clenched his jaw, using much of his willpower to restrain himself. It would be futile and pointless to persuade Gendo not to take that deadly path again. _The Committee must have pushed him too far that he wants to play this insane gamble,_ he thought angrily. _You're so damned stubborn._  
无言地，冬月紧咬牙关，用尽大部分意志力克制自己。试图说服碇不重蹈那条致命之路是徒劳无益的。委员会一定把他逼得太紧，以至于他想玩这场疯狂的赌局，他愤怒地想。你真是顽固透顶。

"As with any scientific endeavor, it may be unpleasant," Gendo said to them, "but very important. What we have started, we must finish it. Since both of you will be the very core of this experiment, and I believe that there are no problems with your well-being, I ask you a question: are you ready?"  
“正如任何科学探索一样，这可能令人不快，”碇对他们说，“但极为重要。我们既然开始了，就必须完成它。既然你们两位将是这项实验的核心，我相信你们的健康没有问题，我向你们提问：你们准备好了吗？”

Kaworu and Rei stared at each other, trying to make up their minds.  
渚薰和绫波零互相凝视，试图下定决心。

_I never realized that he can even make sudden, rash decisions regardless of any circumstances,_ Kaworu thought. _But since this Lilim is very persistent, trying to fathom the unknown, thinking he has everything… I will have to see how this leads to. I'm not afraid of any challenge. I think I can handle it, as I have to show him what he wants._  
我从未意识到他竟能在任何情况下做出如此突然、冲动的决定，渚薰心想。但既然这个人类如此执着，试图探寻未知，自以为掌握一切……我得看看这将如何发展。我不惧任何挑战。我想我能应对，因为我必须向他展示他所渴望的。

_Very well, then... There's no turning back.  
那么，就这样吧...已经没有回头路了。_

Kaworu now faced Gendo, and the eyes behind the tinted glasses were demanding for his decision, but never too long.  
薰现在面对着碇，墨镜后的目光迫切等待他的决定，但并未持续太久。

"I'm ready, sir," Kaworu answered.  
“我准备好了，先生。” 渚薰回答道。

_I existed because he needed me,_ Rei contemplated. _He wants me to be with Nagisa on purpose and as duty. However I do not know if Unit One is still able to accept me as its pilot._  
“我存在是因为他需要我，”绫波丽思索着。“他有意让我陪伴渚，这是我的职责。然而，我不知道初号机是否还能接受我作为它的驾驶员。”

_I am not very sure.  
“我不太确定。”_

Kaworu slowly looked at Rei, as if his eyes told her he was greatly concerned.  
渚薰缓缓地看向绫波，仿佛他的眼神在告诉她，他非常担忧。

_As I am doubtful, I have nothing else but need his help.  
既然我心存疑虑，除了需要他的帮助，我别无他法。_

"Yes, Commander, I will participate," Rei replied with a nod.  
"是的，指挥官，我会参加。" 丽点头回答道。

Gendo now focused at Fuyutsuki with a triumphant, silent smirk. The old man will have to live with the decision.  
源堂此刻正对着冬月露出胜利而无声的冷笑。这位老人将不得不承受这个决定带来的后果。

In the hallway, Shinji and Misato were waiting by the door to Fuyutsuki's office, sitting on a bench when the Sub-Commander appeared, walking down to their direction. He was flush with red, breathing heavily, and wore a grave expression on his face. He was also carrying the proposal folder that Gendo gave to him.  
在走廊里，真嗣和美里正坐在通往冬月办公室的门旁的长椅上等待，这时副司令出现了，朝他们的方向走来。他的脸涨得通红，呼吸急促，脸上带着严肃的表情。他手里还拿着源堂交给他的提案文件夹。

"Sir, what's wrong?" Misato asked.  
“长官，出什么事了？”美里问道。

"I can't believe his nerve," Fuyutsuki grumbled as he opened the door. "Come inside, Major."  
"真不敢相信他这么厚脸皮，" 副司令官冬月咕哝着打开了门。"请进，少校。"

Fuyutsuki's office was tidy, comfortable and ordered, with window curtains opened wide to offer a magnificent view of the Geofront. Framed certificates and photos were on the walls along with rows of books and publications on shelves, but his most special picture was on his desk.  
冬月的办公室整洁、舒适且井然有序，窗帘拉开，展现出地表前方的壮丽景色。墙上挂着装裱好的证书和照片，书架上排列着书籍和出版物，但他最特别的照片放在办公桌上。

He offered Misato and Shinji a chair each before his desk, then Fuyutsuki plopped onto his chair. He rummaged through the drawers in his desk and brought out a jar of antacid tablets.  
他先让美里和真嗣各自坐在办公桌前的椅子上，然后冬月一屁股坐回自己的椅子。他在办公桌抽屉里翻找了一番，拿出一罐抗酸药片。

"Heartburn," Fuyutsuki said grimly as he took two antacids and chewed them. "I couldn't believe what he said right there, it was out of the blue. He's pushing his luck too far."  
"胃灼热，" 冬月严肃地说着，拿起两片抗酸药咀嚼起来。"我简直不敢相信他刚才说的话，太突然了。他这是在过分冒险。"

"What's it all about?" Misato inquired. "I'm sure it's bad news, sir."  
"这是怎么回事？" 美里询问道。"我敢肯定这不是什么好消息，长官。"

"You're right. The Commander wants to revive the Dummy Plug, starting today."  
"你说得对。司令想从今天开始重启傀儡系统。"

"WHAT?" Misato and Shinji screeched in unison, as they nearly jumped out of their seats in shock.  
"什么？" 美里和真嗣异口同声地尖叫起来，差点从座位上跳了起来，震惊不已。

Fuyutsuki took a deep breath and recounted what transpired with his conversation with Gendo.  
冬月深吸了一口气，回忆起他与碇源堂的对话。

"I don't understand why he would do such a thing again," Misato said, tabling the folder back on the desk after the explanation. "That damned Dummy Plug nearly killed us all!"  
"我不明白他为什么又要这么做，"美里说着，将文件夹推回到桌子上，听完解释后。"那个该死的模拟插入栓差点害死我们所有人！"

"I tried to talk him out of it but he overruled me," Fuyutsuki replied. "Unless in a disaster, I don't think he's going to listen to reason and he thinks he can do everything what it takes after they've badgered him to go one step further. But all I think is that he wants to take advantage of Ayanami's new 'purity'. Already he convinced Nagisa and Ayanami and promptly assigned them to pilot the Evas at the preliminary testing stage."  
"我试图劝阻他，但他否决了我，" 副司令说道。"除非发生灾难，否则我认为他不会听从理智。他认为自己能做一切必要之事，尤其是在他们一再逼迫他再进一步之后。但我认为，他只是想利用绫波的新'纯洁'。他已经说服了渚和绫波，并迅速安排他们在初步测试阶段驾驶 Eva。"

Misato knew what the "they" meant: The Instrumentality Committee of Grumpy Old Men.  
美里知道"他们"指的是谁：那些脾气暴躁的老头子组成的统一化委员会。

"After all the trouble we had with the Plug," Misato said, "I'm starting to wonder if everyone else here is beginning to doubt their sanity for being a part of this scheme. This isn't going to fly; this could again have a lot of people getting hurt or even killed."  
"经历了插入栓的麻烦之后，" 美里说，"我开始怀疑，这里是否有人开始怀疑自己参与这个计划的理智。这行不通的；这可能会再次导致许多人受伤甚至丧命。"

Shinji now looked down to the floor and shook his head in frustration. Misato placed her hand onto his shoulder to reassure him. She knew that he took most of the brunt of witnessing the brutal results of the Dummy Plug's power.  
真嗣低头看着地板，沮丧地摇了摇头。美里把手放在他的肩膀上安慰他。她知道，他承受了大部分目睹模拟插入栓威力造成的残酷后果的冲击。

"Sir, what are we going to do, then?" Misato asked.  
"长官，那我们接下来该怎么办？"美里问道。

Fuyutsuki ran his fingers through his gray hair. Sometimes he did this when he was worried or exasperated. "God help us," he muttered. "We'll have no option except to ride it out and wish for the best. Right now they're preparing the Evas and the pilots, and we'll have to go there and see if his stunt would work."  
冬月用手指梳理着他灰白的头发。有时他这样做是因为担心或恼怒。“上帝保佑我们，”他喃喃自语，“我们别无选择，只能硬着头皮撑过去，祈祷一切顺利。现在他们正在准备 EVA 和驾驶员，我们得过去看看他的把戏是否奏效。”

They all stood up and walked out of the office. As they paced towards the Test Facility, Misato nudged close to the young man.  
他们都站起身，走出了办公室。当他们走向测试设施时，美里靠近了那个年轻人。

"Shinji, if anything goes wrong, try to get out of the way," Misato sternly advised the Third Children. He nodded obediently.  
“真嗣，如果有什么不对劲，尽量避开，”美里严肃地告诫第三适格者。他顺从地点了点头。

"I just wish nothing should go wrong," Shinji commented nervously.  
"我只是希望一切顺利，" 真嗣紧张地评论道。

In the Children's locker room, Rei and Kaworu were in separate dressing cubicles, suiting up for the mission, knowing the difficulty ahead of them. Only Kaworu felt a growing doubt about the task given to them.  
在孩子们的更衣室里，绫波和渚分别在各自的更衣间内，为即将到来的任务做准备，他们都知道前方的困难。只有渚心中对分配给他们的任务产生了越来越大的疑虑。

"Ayanami," Kaworu said, breaking the near-silence as he finished wearing his blue-purple suit. "Are you sure you can still handle this?"  
"绫波，" 渚打破了近乎沉默，他穿上了蓝紫色的战斗服，问道，"你确定还能应付得了吗？"

"Yes," Rei answered as she pressed both wrist buttons to tighten up the fit of her white plug suit. "This is what the Commander wanted, and so this is my duty."  
“是的，”丽回答道，同时按下双腕按钮收紧白色插入栓服的贴合度。“这是司令的意愿，因此这是我的职责。”

Kaworu shook his head, but noticed the hint of doubt in Rei's voice. "The Sub-Commander wasn't happy at all, because I think he's been there before, and didn't want to try again."  
渚薰摇了摇头，但注意到了绫波声音中隐约的疑虑。“副司令一点也不高兴，因为我觉得他以前经历过这种事，不想再尝试了。”

"The Commander could be correct in his proposal," Rei countered, yet Kaworu slowly took hold of her right hand and held it gently.  
“司令的提议可能是正确的，”绫波反驳道，然而渚薰缓缓握住了她的右手，温柔地握着。

"Rei, listen to me," Kaworu spoke, using her first name to get more personal. "I know that being useful and dutiful are all-important for you, but honestly, for the first time I'm a bit more concerned about what we're about to do. I'm sure that even Shinji and Misato are just as worried right now for your safety, assuming that the Sub-Commander told them what happened back there."  
“绫波，听我说，”渚薰用她的名字称呼她，以显得更亲密。“我知道对你来说，有用和尽职是最重要的，但老实说，这是我第一次对我们即将要做的事情感到有些担忧。我相信，即使真嗣和美里现在也一定在为你的安全担心，假设副司令告诉了他们那里发生的事。”

"But…"

"Since we cannot refuse at the last minute, and the Commander insists on getting his results at any cost, if anything happens to you, I'll be there at your side," he promised.  
"既然我们无法在最后一刻拒绝，而指挥官坚持不惜一切代价获取结果，如果有什么意外发生在你身上，我会陪在你身边，" 他承诺道。

"I understand," Rei replied.  
"我明白，" 丽回答。

"Trust me on this; I'm ready for you, so try to be at least strong."  
"相信我，我已经准备好了，所以你至少得拿出点实力来。"

Rei nodded before they heard the voice of the Eva crew chief, waiting at the door.  
丽点了点头，随后他们听到了 EVA 维修班班长的声音，他在门口等候着。

"Are you Children prepared now?" he asked loudly.  
"你们这些孩子们现在准备好了吗？" 他大声问道。

"Yes," Kaworu answered. "Both of us are ready."  
"是的，" 薰回答。"我们俩都准备好了。

At the Test Facility, the atmosphere in the control room was considerably tense, and almost everyone working inside experienced, one way or another, the uncomfortable prospect of an out-of-control, 80-meter tall Eva. Therefore, as a precaution against the possibility of some obliterated ferroconcrete chunks flying around once hell breaks loose, they were now either wearing construction-yard hard hats or combat helmets.  
在测试设施中，控制室内的气氛异常紧张，几乎每个在场的工作人员都或多或少地感受到了一台失控的 80 米高 Eva 所带来的不安。因此，为了预防一旦混乱爆发时会有被摧毁的钢筋混凝土块四处飞溅，他们现在要么戴着建筑工地的安全帽，要么佩戴着战斗头盔。

The stakes went even higher as they got word that the First Children would be inserted into Unit-01. They knew that she and the original Dummy Plug were rejected several times before, often with disastrous results.  
当他们得知第一适格者将被插入到零号机中时，风险更是急剧上升。他们知道她和最初的模拟插入栓之前曾多次被拒绝，结果往往灾难性。

As the control room techs and scientists were chatting nervously while working, Makoto, Shigeru and Maya among them, they were less than pleased to have a front-row seat of the action, but only Commander Ikari was fearless, very confident in his foresight. He was in total control at this moment, and to ensure that there will be no dissenters he assigned Section Two agents to guard the entrance to the control room.  
控制室里的技术人员和科学家们一边紧张地工作一边低声交谈，真、四郎和摩耶等人也在其中，他们对于能近距离目睹这一切并不感到高兴，但只有司令碇源堂无所畏惧，对自己的先见之明充满信心。此刻他完全掌控着局面，为了确保无人反对，他指派第二分队的特工守卫控制室的入口。

He wanted Fuyutsuki away from him, for now.  
他现在希望冬月离他远点。

Gendo could see the technicians swarming about around the scaffolds, rigs and gantries, disconnecting lines, tightening hoses and connectors, packing up and clearing the test floor, as crews at the plug insertion deck were preparing the Entry Plugs and the LCL injectors.  
碇可以看到技术人员们在脚手架、吊车和起重机周围忙碌，断开线路，紧固软管和连接器，打包清理测试场地，而插入栓甲板上的工作人员正在准备插入栓和 LCL 注射器。

The two Evas now had their pauldrons and arms bolted to heavy restraints, while two huge cranes held aloft massive electrical plugs of the umbilical cords, ready to plug in the power. The emergency systems were also in place, including Bakelite dispensers, fire extinguishers and foam, medics and fire-fighting crews.  
两台 EVA 现在已将肩甲和手臂固定在重型约束装置上，而两台巨型起重机则高举着巨大的脐带电缆电源插头，准备接入电源。紧急系统也已就位，包括酚醛塑料喷洒器、灭火器和泡沫，以及医疗人员和消防队伍。

All of this activity was music to Gendo's ears; it was the poetry he could not read and the summit he longed to scale.  
这一切活动对碇源堂来说如同美妙的音乐；这是他无法阅读的诗篇，也是他渴望攀登的顶峰。

---

As the crew finished readying the Plugs, and actuator arms lowered the Children on the cockpits into the capsules, Kaworu looked back at Rei and into her cerise eyes. The girl nodded back, knowing that he would be there for her, before Kaworu gave her a thumbs-up.  
当机组人员完成插头的准备工作，驱动臂将孩子们放入驾驶舱进入胶囊时，渚薰回头看向绫波，凝视着她那紫红色的眼睛。女孩点头回应，知道他会在这里支持她，随后渚薰向她竖起了大拇指。

_Rei, you can handle this,_ Kaworu thought. _Just be okay._  
绫波，你能处理好这个的，薰心想。一定要没事。

"Everything's all right, Children," the crew chief said, glancing up as the rest of the crew cleared the deck. "You're all set to go."  
“一切都好，孩子们，”乘员长说道，抬头望向其他乘员清理甲板。“你们准备就绪了。”

Kaworu nodded. "Thanks, sir," he replied as the massive cover of their Entry Plugs slid down and clamped shut over the Children's heads.  
薰点点头。“谢谢您，长官。”他回应道，随着巨大的插入栓盖板滑下并紧闭在孩子们的头上。

---

The control room was now ready for the initiation sequence. Everyone stationed at their own workstations, eyes on every gauge and meter. Banks of monitors showed camera shots of the test floor, the Evas and the Entry Plugs.  
控制室现已准备就绪，即将启动初始程序。每个人都在自己的工作站就位，目光紧盯着每一个仪表和计量器。一排排监视器显示着测试场地的画面，包括 EVA 机体和插入栓。

"Everything is clear down at the floor," Makoto reported, "and both Evas are fully restrained."  
“场地一切正常，”真希波报告道，“两台 EVA 均已完全固定。”

"Ibuki, start up all systems for Unit Two," Gendo commanded.  
“伊吹，启动二号机所有系统，”源堂命令道。

Maya began to type in commands to begin the sequence, before switches were thrown to insert Kaworu's Entry Plug into Unit-02. The armored carapace shut over the plug and LCL was pumped into her. Then power was allowed into the umbilical cord in increments, as the control room crew watched every figure and graph on their monitors, guarding every small amount being injected into Unit-02. When the nerve branches came next, everyone watched as Kaworu's link points matched up with the Eva before his A-10 connection confirmed a solid hookup.  
玛雅开始输入指令启动序列，随后开关被拉动，将薰的插入栓插入二号机。装甲外壳闭合，LCL 被注入。接着，电源以增量方式接入脐带电缆，控制室内的乘员们紧盯着监视器上的每一个数字和图表，守护着注入二号机的每一小部分能量。当神经分支连接时，所有人都注视着薰的连接点与 Eva 对齐，随后 A-10 连接确认了稳固的连接。

"The mutual lines are connected, and his synchronization rate is at 65.2%," Maya reported, while trying not to let the nervousness come out of her voice.  
“同步线路已连接，他的同步率达到了 65.2%，”玛雅报告道，努力不让紧张的情绪从声音中流露出来。

On one of the monitors connected to Unit-02's video feed from the inside of the Entry Plug, Kaworu showed a thumbs-up at the camera before him, reassuring everyone that he was okay. He also once again felt the soul inside Unit-02, but because of her weak will was subdued into seclusion as though she was overwhelmed by his presence, enabling him to control the Eva from the Entry Plug. However, from time to time he briefly glanced at Unit-01 standing by his side, wondering what Rei was feeling at the moment.  
在连接到二号机内部插入栓视频反馈的一个监视器上，薰对着面前的摄像头竖起大拇指，向大家保证他没事。他也再次感受到了二号机内的灵魂，但由于其意志薄弱，被他的存在所压制，如同被淹没一般隐退，使他能够从插入栓控制 EVA。然而，他不时短暂地瞥向一旁待命的一号机，好奇丽此刻在想些什么。

"Good. Now prepare Unit One," Gendo said.  
"好。现在准备一号机," 源堂说道。

This time Maya had a bit of hesitation before she carefully entered the commands.  
这次，玛雅在小心翼翼地输入指令前，心中略感迟疑。

Gendo peered into one of the monitors showing Rei in the Entry Plug. "First Children, are you prepared?" he asked.  
源渡凝视着其中一个显示着零在插入栓内的监视器。“第一适格者，你准备好了吗？”他问道。

Onscreen, Rei nodded quietly as she gripped the butterfly control handles.  
屏幕上，零静静地点了点头，紧握着蝴蝶形状的操纵杆。

"Insert and fill the plug now, Aoba," Gendo ordered.  
“现在插入并填充插入栓，青叶，”源渡命令道。

Shigeru took a deep breath and flipped the switches to allow several pistons to push Rei's Entry Plug into Unit-01, before they all heard the carapace lock the plug into place, and the LCL injector connected into the plug, filling it up with amniotic orange liquid. The sensors told them that the insertion was successful.  
斯格鲁夫深吸一口气，翻动开关，让几个活塞将绫波的插入栓推入零号机体内，随后他们听到外壳锁定了插入栓，同时 LCL 注入口连接到位，注满了橙色的羊水状液体。传感器显示插入成功。

"Initial plug depth is now set at 0.105, and plug data has been reprogrammed for Ayanami. LCL internal pressure, temperature, electrolyte and oxygen mixtures are at nominal levels. Main power is ready to be activated," Shigeru reported. He could now see Rei breathing in the LCL.  
初始插入深度已设定为 0.105，插入栓数据已重新编程以适应绫波。LCL 内部压力、温度、电解质及氧气混合物均处于标准状态。主电源已准备就绪，" 斯格鲁夫报告道。他现在可以看到绫波在 LCL 中呼吸。

"Excellent. Prepare to power up Unit One," Gendo commanded.  
“很好。准备启动初号机，”碇源堂命令道。

Makoto pushed a lever to plug the umbilical cord and another to let in several thousand electron volts through the cord up to Unit-01. As he did, he was silently praying that the First Children could survive this one.  
真嗣推下一个操纵杆连接脐带电缆，又推下另一个让数千电子伏特通过电缆输入到零一单元。与此同时，他在心中默默祈祷，希望这位第一适格者能够挺过这一关。

The power indicators now lit up in green, confirming optimal levels.  
电源指示灯现在亮起了绿色，确认达到了最佳水平。

"Input voltage is now green and optimized," Makoto reported.  
“输入电压现已稳定并优化。”真琴报告道。

"Start activation system, second phase," Gendo instructed.  
"启动激活系统，第二阶段，" 碇源堂指示道。

"Synapses inserted. Junction with pilot in progress," Shigeru said.  
"突触已插入。与驾驶员连接中，" 东治报告说。

"Pulses transmitted, all circuits are operational. Initial contacts confirmed." Maya answered.  
"脉冲已传输，所有电路正常运行。初步接触已确认。" 真耶回答道。

---

Inside the horned Unit-01, Rei Ayanami patiently waited for the preparation sequence to finish when she began to notice something wrong with the LCL. Her nose instinctually quivered.  
在有角的零壹号机内部，绫波零耐心等待着准备程序完成，这时她开始察觉到 LCL 有些不对劲。她的鼻子本能地抽动了一下。

_Is it… the smell of blood?  
这是……血的气味吗？_

Then alarms began to shrill loudly all over the entire plug. Warning boxes flashed and painted the heads-up display, overwhelming her field of vision. A loud metallic echo reverated throughout, as if the plug was being crumpled in a junk-car compactor.  
随即，警报声开始在整个插入栓内尖锐地响起。警告框闪烁着，覆盖了她的抬头显示，使她的视野一片混乱。一阵响亮的金属回声在整个空间内回荡，仿佛插入栓正被压入废车压缩机中。

Her eyes instantly bulged in shock.  
她的眼睛瞬间因震惊而瞪大。

_No!_

Suddenly she couldn't breathe!  
突然间，她无法呼吸了！

Rei was now beginning to choke and just as she was struggling in her seat and stars popping in her eyes while clutching her throat, a heavy surge of psychic energy rushed into her mind; images, voices and words crashing in like a tsunami, clamshelling her into the vortex, and her past, present and future seem to collide into a singular mass, culminating in several streams of thought patterns and threads of color, before resolving into an image in her mind:  
丽现在开始感到窒息，正当她在座位上挣扎，眼中闪烁着星星，紧抓着喉咙时，一股强大的心灵能量涌入她的脑海；图像、声音和话语如海啸般涌入，将她卷入漩涡，她的过去、现在和未来似乎汇聚成一个整体，最终化为几股思维模式和色彩线条，在她心中凝聚成一幅画面：

_Rei was now standing in a pool of LCL, observing two more in her image. Where she was she didn't know.  
丽现在站在一池 LCL 中，观察着另外两个与她相似的身影。她不知道自己身处何地。_

_The first Rei,_ _all encrusted with swollen veins, horribly throbbing with life of their own,_ _spoke. "Who is it? Is it me? I am within Eva? No, I feel that someone else other than me is there. Who are you? An Angel, is it the being that we call an Angel?"_  
第一个丽，全身布满肿胀的血管，可怕地自行跳动着，开口说道：“是谁？是我吗？我在 Eva 里面吗？不，我感觉有别人在那里。你是谁？是天使吗？是我们称之为天使的存在吗？”

_The second Rei stared at the first. She looked unblemished, yet somehow there was this sinister quality to her. The Angel.  
_第二个丽盯着第一个。她看起来完好无损，但不知为何有一种邪恶的气质。那个天使。  
_

"_Don't you want to be unified with me?" she asked._  
“你不想与我合一吗？”她问道。

_The first Rei shook her head.  
第一个丽摇了摇头。_

"_No," the First objected. "I am myself... I am not like you."_  
“不，”第一个丽反驳道，“我是我自己……我和你不一样。”

_The second Rei shrugged her shoulders.  
第二个丽耸了耸肩。_

"_Hmm, but you shall see. It is too late for you, but I will give you part of my mind. I shall give you this emotion. Pain, you see, First Children, your mind has pain and suffering."_  
“哼，但你将会看到。对你来说已经太迟了，但我会分给你一部分我的意识。我将赋予你这种情感。痛苦，你看，第一代孩子们，你们的内心充满了痛苦和苦难。”

_The first Rei frowned. "Is that pain? No, this is something different. It is loneliness. Yes..."  
第一个绫波皱眉。“这是痛苦吗？不，这是不同的感觉。是孤独。是的……”_

"_But why it is loneliness? I cannot understand," the second infested Rei countered, almost perplexed._  
“但为什么是孤独？我不明白，”第二个被感染的绫波反驳道，几乎感到困惑。

"_Do you hate being alone? We are many of ourselves, though you despise being alone. That is called loneliness," the first Rei said._  
“你讨厌独自一人吗？我们虽有许多自我，但你厌恶独处。那便是孤独，”第一个绫波说。

_The second Rei shook her head and closed her eyes. "That is your mind, full of sadness. That is your own mind and thoughts."  
第二个丽摇了摇头，闭上了眼睛。“那是你充满悲伤的心灵。那是你自己的心灵和思想。”_

Another memory began to surface. There was a loud crack not unlike a bullet's trajectory or a lightning strike.  
另一段记忆开始浮现。一声巨响，宛如子弹的轨迹或闪电的轰击。

_Rei was riding on the escalator along with Shinji, but at the same time they were arguing over his father's conduct towards him.  
丽和真嗣一起乘坐着自动扶梯，但同时他们也在争论他父亲对他的态度。_

"_You are the son of the Commander, are you not?" Rei questioned._  
“你是司令的儿子，不是吗？”丽质问道。

_Shinji was frowning. "Yes," he replied.  
真嗣皱着眉头。“是的，”他回答道。_

"_Then why you could not trust your father and his work?"_  
"那你为什么不信任你的父亲和他的工作呢？"

"_Of course I can't trust him like that! He drives me nuts!" Shinji shot back, before Rei came close and slapped him in contempt._  
"我当然不能那样信任他！他快把我逼疯了！" 真嗣回击道，随后绫波靠近并轻蔑地扇了他一巴掌。

Now a memory of Asuka swam into view. They were in the elevator.  
此刻，明日香的记忆浮现在脑海中。他们当时在电梯里。

"_If you do not open your heart and mind to her, Eva will not move," Rei admonished Asuka._  
"如果你不向她敞开心扉，Eva 是不会动的，" 绫波告诫明日香。

_But Asuka looked back at her with total contempt. "You mean I'm closing myself off and everything? Is that true?"  
但明日香回头看她时，眼中满是鄙夷。“你是说我把自己封闭起来了吗？真是这样吗？”_

"_Yes," Rei answered without much emotion. "Eva has her own mind and soul."_  
“是的，”绫波回答得毫无感情。“Eva 有自己的思想和灵魂。”

_Asuka frowned deeply, completely skeptical of the idea. "That doll? You think it has a conscience?"  
明日香皱眉深思，对这个想法完全持怀疑态度。“那个玩偶？你觉得它有良心？”_

"_You should be aware of that."_  
"你应该明白这一点。"

_Suddenly Asuka grinned and leered at Rei, as if her annoyance level has gone through the roof.  
突然，Asuka 咧嘴一笑，恶狠狠地盯着 Rei，仿佛她的烦躁程度已经爆表。_

"_Ha! Today's so special, you know," Asuka answered loudly, rage and frustration soaked in her voice, "because it's your first time you're talking to me. Heck, we'll have snow falling and later some cherry blossoms on a day like this. Damn, talk about a miracle! Are you so fucking happy that I can't use Unit Two? Don't worry, you little Prozac-hungry twit. When an Angel comes knocking on the door, big Shinji will kill that fucking thing, and we don't have anything to do except to hang around. Goddamn it, they only need Shinji because he thinks he has it all! If he's there, everything's all fine. HA! Now I'm almost out of a career! Not only you've got Shinji, but a doll like you is trying to get along with me!"_  
"哈！你知道今天有多特别吗？" Asuka 大声回答，声音中充满了愤怒和挫败感，"因为这是你第一次跟我说话。见鬼，这种日子还会下雪，然后还会飘起樱花。该死，真是奇迹！你他妈是不是因为我不能用二号机就这么高兴？别担心，你这个小药鬼。当使徒来敲门时，大个子的 Shinji 会干掉那该死的东西，我们除了闲逛什么也不用做。该死的，他们只需要 Shinji，因为他觉得自己无所不能！只要有他在，一切都没问题。哈！现在我几乎要失业了！不仅你有 Shinji，还有你这样的玩偶试图跟我套近乎！"

"_I am not a doll," Rei answered, not moving a single inch where she was standing._  
"我不是玩偶，" Rei 回答道，站在原地一动不动。

_Asuka yelled back. "Shut up, you frigid bitch! You do anything you're ordered to. You'll even waste yourself if Commander Ikari orders you to do so!"  
明日香回吼道。"闭嘴，你这个冷血婊子！你只会唯命是从。就算是碇司令让你牺牲自己，你也会照做不误！"_

_Rei never even blinked. "Yes, I will."  
丽从未眨眼。“是的，我愿意。”_

_The reply left Asuka laughing sarcastically, not knowing the truth in Rei's words.  
这回答让明日香嘲讽地笑了起来，她并不知道丽话语中的真相。_

Finally, she found herself staring at the enraged, burning eyes of Naoko Akagi.  
最终，她发现自己正盯着直子·赤木那双愤怒燃烧的眼睛。

_"You are a hag, aren't you?" Rei questioned Naoko, who was becoming agitated.  
“你是个老巫婆，对吧？”绫波对直子说道，后者正变得越发焦躁。_

_Naoko yelled back at her. "You're pissing me off! That's it! I'll ask the Chief to stop you!"  
直子冲她吼了回去。“你惹毛我了！就这样！我要让总监停了你的职！”_

_But Rei could not silence herself, mouthing her mantra. "It's the Chief who calls you that. That hag is stubborn, that hag is now useless, that hag is stubborn, that hag is now useless…"  
但丽无法保持沉默，喃喃自语着她的咒语。“是指挥官这么称呼你的。那个老太婆固执，那个老太婆现在没用了，那个老太婆固执，那个老太婆现在没用了……”_

_Naoko screamed. "STOP IT!"  
直子尖叫道：“住手！”_

_There was no stopping, as Naoko was getting redder in the face.  
无法阻止，直子脸上的红色越来越深。_

_"That hag is stubborn, that hag is now useless. It's the Chief who calls you that," Rei kept on the mantra.  
“那个老太婆固执，那个老太婆现在没用了。是主任这么叫你的，”丽继续念叨着。_

_It was too late. Naoko was already cracked up and off her rocker. "Damn you, you're also useless, fucking USELESS brat because there will be other copies of you even if you're dead! You're JUST LIKE ME!"  
已经太迟了。直子已经崩溃，精神失常。“该死的，你也没用，真他妈没用的家伙，因为就算你死了也会有其他复制品！你就像我一样！”_

_With complete odium, Naoko strangled the little girl to death, shattering her trachea.  
带着满腔的憎恨，直子将小女孩活活勒死，粉碎了她的气管。_

Bedlam broke loose as the control room frantically tried to stop Unit-01 from tearing away from its restraints, but failed. Already, most of the room's occupants jumped off their seats and scrambled for cover. Klaxons were screaming, and blinkers were flashing red.  
混乱爆发，控制室疯狂地试图阻止 01 号机挣脱束缚，但失败了。房间内的大多数人已经跳离座位，四处寻找掩护。警报器尖叫着，闪光灯红光频闪。

Still trying to stay on, Makoto Hyuga repeatedly punched the Bakelite button, but the dispensers weren't working. Apparently Unit-01 damaged one of the Bakelite supply pipes in the wall or the pumps as she went on a smashing frenzy. He also tried to activate the automatic plug ejection system, but to no avail it was hung up on something, another infuriating glitch.  
仍然试图保持镇定的久野木笃志反复按下酚醛树脂按钮，但释放器毫无反应。显然，01 号机在疯狂破坏时损坏了墙内的一条酚醛树脂供应管道或泵。他还尝试激活自动插头弹射系统，但同样无济于事，系统被什么东西卡住了，又是一个令人恼火的故障。

"DAMN IT!" he cursed, before he saw a fistful of Test Type Eva coming his way. He ducked behind the console as the purple knuckles cracked the thick, meshed plates of glass, but chips of concrete pelted the top of his helmeted head. He then turned his attention to the Commander, who was just standing there like a captain behind the wheel in a sinking ship.  
“该死！”他咒骂道，随即看到一拳测试型 EVA 向他袭来。他躲在控制台后，紫色的拳头击碎了厚厚的网状玻璃板，但混凝土碎片击中了他头盔的顶部。然后，他将注意力转向指挥官，后者就像沉船上的船长一样，站在那里一动不动。

Makoto shook his head. "Commander!" he yelled. "We have to go!"  
真琴摇了摇头。"指挥官！"他大喊道。"我们必须走了！"

"Unit Two, immediately stop Unit One!" Gendo quickly ordered aloud as he flipped a switch on the console to disengage the restraints locking down Unit-02.  
"二号机，立即阻止一号机！" 源堂迅速大声下令，同时按下控制台上的开关，解除了锁定二号机的拘束装置。

"Yes, I'm coming in, Commander!" Kaworu obeyed, and he and Unit-02 got out of the restraints and tore away a steel-mesh divider. They took hold of Unit-01's arms, but the purple beast broke free, grabbed and hurled the other Eva to the wall. Chunks of concrete flew off from the impact zone as she bounced on the concrete.  
“是的，我进来了，指挥官！” 薰遵从命令，他和二号机挣脱束缚，撕开一道钢网隔板。他们抓住初号机的手臂，但那紫色巨兽挣脱束缚，抓住并猛掷另一台 EVA 撞向墙壁。撞击区的水泥块四溅，她弹跳在混凝土上。

Trying to go after Commander Ikari, Eva Unit-01 sent more crashing fists into the control room, pulverizing the wall and some of the windows to smithereens, and then Unit-02 jumped up to grab the pauldrons again to ride on her. The Eva still bucking, Kaworu now attempted to locate the ejection handle and the cord release.  
试图追赶碇司令，初号机向控制室挥出更多重拳，粉碎了墙壁和部分窗户，随后二号机跃起再次抓住肩甲骑乘其上。EVA 仍在颠簸，薰现在尝试寻找弹射把手和电缆释放装置。

_Where is it?_ Kaworu thought as he fumbled Unit-02's hand along Unit-01's spine, trying to feel for the hidden releases. Of late, these were incorporated as part of an emergency measure in an event should the automatic shutdown and ejection failed, and an accompanying Eva can help its fallen comrade and recover the troubled pilot.  
在哪里？薰思索着，二号机的手摸索着初号机的脊背，试图感知隐藏的释放装置。最近，这些被纳入紧急措施，以防自动关机和弹射失败，另一台 EVA 可以协助其倒下的战友并救助陷入困境的驾驶员。

Even as Unit-01 tried to shake them off, Kaworu found the releases and yanked them both outward. The umbilical cord snaked loose as it dropped to the floor, before Unit-01 started to slump forward, losing all power and control. Kaworu caught the Eva as she fell down, and he saw Rei's Entry Plug popped out of the spine. He then pulled the plug away and carefully laid it on the concrete floor. Only afterwards as that plug ejected a great deal of LCL did he allow himself to get off Unit-02.  
即使初号机试图甩开他们，渚薰还是找到了释放装置，将两者一同向外拉扯。脐带电缆如蛇般松脱，掉落在地，随后初号机开始向前倾倒，失去所有动力和控制。渚薰接住了倒下的 Eva，看到绫波的插入栓从脊椎处弹出。他随即拉出插入栓，小心翼翼地放在混凝土地面上。直到插入栓排出大量 LCL 后，他才允许自己从二号机上下来。

_Ayanami!_ Kaworu yelled in his thoughts as he shut down the red Eva and pulled a lever just below his seat to eject the plug so that he could use the escape hatch. All power were instantly extinguished and LCL began to drain away as the Entry Plug slipped itself out of the spine, before Kaworu opened the hatch and kicked it away with his feet.  
绫波！渚薰在心中呼喊着，同时关闭了红色 Eva，拉动座椅下方的操纵杆弹出插入栓，以便使用逃生舱。所有动力瞬间熄灭，LCL 开始排空，插入栓从脊椎滑出，随后渚薰打开舱门，用脚将其踢开。

The Fifth Children crawled, slid and jumped down Unit-02's back and limbs before he rushed towards the rescued Entry Plug. He came close but as he was about to grab the hatch, he immediately sensed an awful amount of heat on the metal surface of the plug. Kaworu instinctively pulled his hands away from it.  
第五适格者爬行、滑落并跳下二号机的背部和四肢，然后冲向被救出的插入栓。他靠近了，但就在即将抓住舱门时，立刻感觉到插入栓金属表面异常的高温。渚薰本能地缩回了手。

Quickly seeking for what he wanted, he found a fire hose along the wall of the test pit, grabbed and pulled the nozzle, and opened the valve. Kaworu blasted the heated plug with water, steam hissing from its surface until it was cool enough to touch the escape hatch. He pulled and twisted the release levers and the hatch opened up.  
他迅速寻找所需之物，发现测试坑旁的墙上挂着一条消防水带，抓起喷嘴并打开阀门。真嗣用水枪对准加热过的插头喷射，水蒸气从表面嘶嘶作响，直到冷却到可以触碰逃生舱门。他拉动并旋转释放杆，舱门随即打开。

Now he went in and found Rei unconscious. With great effort he grabbed her by the armpits and started to pull her outside. Once clear of the Entry Plug he laid Rei on her back and began to shake the girl's shoulders.  
他进入舱内，发现丽已失去意识。他费力地抓住她的腋下，开始将她拖出。一离开插入栓，他便让丽平躺，并开始摇晃她的肩膀。

"Rei? Can you hear me?" Kaworu asked.  
“丽？你能听到我吗？”渚薰问道。

No reaction whatsoever. She seemed lifeless. _Wake up, Ayanami._  
没有任何反应。她看起来毫无生气。醒醒，绫波。

Now he cleared her airway with his fingers, tilt her head backward, and perform quick resuscitation. Kaworu pinched her nose and sealed his lips over hers, giving two breaths.  
现在他用手指清理了她的气道，将她的头向后倾斜，并迅速进行复苏。渚薰捏住她的鼻子，将自己的嘴唇紧贴在她的唇上，给了她两次呼吸。

As he did, he felt the tingle of that psychic rush again and saw in his mind the images from Rei's memories, but at the moment he disregarded them as he was more gravely concerned with saving her life.  
就在这时，他又感受到了那种心灵冲击的刺痛，脑海中浮现出丽记忆中的画面，但此刻他更迫切地关注着如何挽救她的生命，因此暂时忽略了这些影像。

Nothing... No response again.  
什么都没有... 再次没有回应。

Kaworu now placed his interlocked hands upon her breastbone, and began to press down and release for fifteen times.  
渚薰将交叠的双手放在她的胸骨上，开始按压并释放，重复了十五次。

Again he gave her his breath and repeatedly compressed her chest until Rei began to spew LCL out of her mouth and nose. The First Children was now coughing and gagging, throwing up the amniotic liquid, and Kaworu found himself staring at her fluttering eyes as she calmed down, taking in new gulps of air. He wiped off the LCL from Rei's cheeks.  
他再次向她吹气，并反复按压她的胸部，直到绫波开始从口鼻中喷出 LCL。第一适格者现在咳嗽着，呕吐出羊水，渚薰发现自己凝视着她颤动的眼睛，她逐渐平静下来，大口吸入新鲜空气。他擦去了绫波脸颊上的 LCL。

Kaworu asked once more as he propped her up to sit, "Rei, are you all right?"  
渚薰再次问道，同时扶她坐起来，“丽，你还好吗？”

Without much to say as she was again breathing heavily on her own, Rei nodded before she laid her head upon Kaworu's chest. "I told you I'll be right there by your side," he whispered. "Hang on there, help is on the way."  
由于她再次艰难地自行呼吸，丽没有多说什么，只是点了点头，然后将头靠在渚薰的胸前。“我告诉过你，我会一直在你身边，”他低声说道，“坚持住，救援马上就到。”

As they waited for the pandemonium to settle down, and his breathing still ragged from exhaustion, Kaworu glanced up to the control room and saw that Gendo Ikari was stoically watching them from there, before he turned his attention to Shinji Ikari, who was looking from the observation room with a shocked face.  
当他们等待混乱平息，他的呼吸因疲惫而急促时，薰抬头望向控制室，看到碇源堂正坚定地从那里注视着他们，随后他将目光转向了真嗣，后者正从观察室里带着震惊的表情看着这一切。

For a moment he wondered what came to their minds in the midst of the carnage, what kept them from trying to run away.  
有那么一刻，他好奇在这样一片混乱中，他们心中所想的是什么，是什么让他们没有试图逃离。

_Have they gone through a situation like this before?_ Kaworu speculated. _I don't know._  
他们以前经历过类似的情况吗？薰猜测着。我不清楚。

Now he remembered something from his psychic contact with Shinji. He saw him in his mind's eye, trying to rescue Rei.  
现在他记起了与真嗣心灵接触时的一些片段。他清晰地看到真嗣在脑海中，努力拯救绫波的情景。

_It now makes sense,_ he reflected, and he then noticed the heavy damage concentrated at the control room. _Why Unit One should go after the Commander?_  
他现在明白了，接着注意到控制室集中了大量损坏。为什么初号机会攻击指挥官？

_Perhaps there is something wrong between him and that Eva.  
或许他和那台 EVA 之间出了什么问题。_

_Maybe it seems that she wants to kill him, but why?  
看起来她似乎想杀了他，但为什么呢？_

Only then the paramedics quickly arrived with a stretcher and they hefted Rei onto it. A neck brace was then placed below her chin and strapped in, while a medic played a beam over her eyes with a flashlight, checking her eyes.  
直到那时，医护人员才迅速带着担架赶到，将丽抬了上去。接着，一个颈托被放置在她的下巴下方并固定好，一名医疗人员用闪光灯在她眼前照射，检查她的眼睛。

"Can I go along to escort her?" Kaworu asked.  
“我可以陪同护送她吗？”渚薰问道。

The medic nodded. "Yes, you may come," he agreed.  
医疗人员点点头。“是的，你可以来，”他同意道。

---

All along and though they were apart, father and son witnessed the entire debacle and Kaworu's rescue, and the scene triggered a flashback in their respective memories. There was the same victim, but different incidents and rescuers.  
尽管父子俩相隔两地，他们目睹了整个混乱局面以及渚薰的救援行动，这一幕触发了他们各自记忆中的闪回。受害者相同，但事件和救援者却不同。

First there was Gendo and his hands were burned in trying to extricate her, and then later Shinji came to the rescue on Mount Futagoyama.  
先是碇源堂，他的双手在试图救她时被烧伤，后来真嗣在富士山救了她。

Now it was Kaworu who saved Rei again.  
现在，又是渚薰再次救了绫波。

Déjà vu.

### Chapter 11 When the Dust Clears  
Chapter 11 尘埃落定之时

Eight minutes before Rei was rejected by Unit-01, Misato, Shinji and Sub-Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki were on their way to the Test Facility.  
在丽被初号机拒绝的八分钟前，美里、真嗣和副司令官富士树子正在前往测试设施的路上。

"Sir, there's something I found out ever since Nagisa came," Misato said in a low voice, trying not to let Shinji, who was trailing behind, eavesdrop on them. "I was supposed to discuss this with you today."  
“先生，自从渚薰来了之后，我发现了一些事情，”美里低声说道，尽量不让跟在后面的真嗣偷听到他们的对话。“我本打算今天和你讨论这件事。”

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Come again?"  
冬月眨了眨眼。“再说一遍？”

"I discovered a great deal of discrepancies on his sync data, that is, he could do anything with it much easier compared to the other Children."  
“我发现他的同步数据存在大量异常，也就是说，他比其他孩子们更容易操控这些数据。”

The old man sighed. "I'm very much aware of it," he whispered, "He has everything, the ideal Eva pilot, but he's also Committee property. That means we shouldn't simply jump on him on mere suspicion. On the other hand, however, I seriously doubt if Ayanami could return to piloting this time. It's been several days since Unit Zero destroyed herself."  
老人叹了口气。“我非常清楚这一点，”他低语道，“他拥有一切，是理想的 Eva 驾驶员，但他也是委员会的财产。这意味着我们不能仅凭怀疑就对他采取行动。然而，另一方面，我严重怀疑绫波这次是否还能重返驾驶舱。零号机自毁已经过去好几天了。”

"I finally understood what she is, sir," Misato said. "Shinji and I went down with Ritsuko to see it for ourselves... why she is the Third."  
"我终于明白了她的身份，先生，"美里说。"真嗣和我跟着律子亲自下去看了... 为什么她是第三使徒。"

Fuyutsuki turned to her and inquired, "At the Dummy Plug Plant?"  
冬月转向她，询问道："在模拟插入栓工厂？"

Misato nodded, and she told him the short version of what transpired down there.  
美里点点头，简要地向他讲述了在那里的经过。

"Then Shinji now knows the truth," Fuyutsuki spoke, "Everything about her manufactured nature, and why there are many copies of her. Is he very much aware of where Ayanami actually came from?"  
"那么，真嗣现在知道了真相，" 冬月说道，"关于她人造的本质，以及为什么会有那么多她的复制品。他是否清楚绫波究竟来自何方？"

"I'm afraid we got only half the story," Misato remarked. "Afterwards, I once overheard him wondering why she and… his mother are almost alike."  
"恐怕我们只听到了一半的故事，" 美里评论道，"后来，我曾无意中听到他在想，为什么她和……他的母亲如此相似。"

Fuyutsuki pursed his lips, apparently trying to make up his mind if he could go on and say the secret he kept for many years. He could imagine her short brown hair, that carefree expression, the soft lips, the gentle demeanor, the intelligence in her eyes…  
冬月抿紧了嘴唇，显然在努力决定是否继续说出他多年来保守的秘密。他能想象她那短短的棕色头发，那无忧无虑的表情，柔软的嘴唇，温和的举止，还有她眼中闪烁的智慧……

Then he spilled the beans in almost a whisper.  
然后他几乎低声细语地泄露了秘密。

"Major, I tell you this: Ayanami is a product of my frustration over the years… for not being able to–"  
“少校，我告诉你：绫波是我多年来挫败感的产物……因为我无法——”

At the threshold of the observation room, this time suddenly the klaxons blared around them, cutting off the conversation, and the PA called everyone to evacuate the premises as Unit-01 broke free of her restraints. The entire Central Dogma shook violently from the pounding of her fists.  
在观测室的门口，这次突然间警报声大作，打断了对话，广播呼叫所有人撤离现场，因为零号机挣脱了束缚。整个中央教条区因她的拳头猛击而剧烈震动。

Shocked by the alarm, Shinji rushed to the window and saw unfolding pandemonium before his very eyes. He merely opened his mouth in shock.  
被警报声惊动，真嗣冲到窗前，眼前是一片混乱的景象。他只是震惊地张大了嘴巴。

---

Several levels below and in her Stockade cell, Ritsuko felt a strong tremor as it roused her from her nap on the iron cot. A surprised expression crossed her face, wondering.  
在地下几层，身处禁闭室的律子在铁床上小憩时感受到了强烈的震动，将她从睡梦中唤醒。她脸上闪过一丝惊讶，心中疑惑。

_What's going on? Was it a chemical explosion?_ She thought.  
发生了什么？是化学爆炸吗？她暗自思忖。

_No, this is too strong for such an explosion. Is it an earthquake? But…  
不，这爆炸的威力太强了。是地震吗？但是……_

Then she remembered a situation like this. She covered her gaping mouth in disbelief.  
然后她想起了类似的情况。她难以置信地捂住了张大的嘴巴。

_Oh, my God, I think Ikari's trying to do something really stupid with the Evas!  
哦，天哪，我想碇司令正试图用 EVA 做些非常愚蠢的事情！_

---

All three of them watched in terror and disbelief as Unit-01 smashed the walls with her mailed fists, while her legs tried to kick free of the lower restraints. A fist hit a wall and chunks of concrete fell out to the floor; and another flew towards the direction of the control room, almost blowing out one of the thickly-layered, mesh-reinforced windows.  
他们三人惊恐且难以置信地看着零一号机用她那戴着铁手套的拳头砸碎墙壁，同时双腿试图挣脱下方的束缚。一拳击中墙壁，混凝土块纷纷掉落到地板上；另一拳则朝控制室方向飞去，差点将那层厚厚的、网格加固的窗户击碎。

While Fuyutsuki instinctively covered her with his arm, beckoning her to stay behind, Misato turned her attention to Shinji and ordered, "Stay down! Just don't try to intefere or you'll get hurt!"  
尽管冬月本能地用胳膊护住她，示意她躲在后面，美里却转向真嗣，命令道：“趴下！别试图干预，否则你会受伤的！”

But Shinji didn't move an inch as he observed the chaos unfolding before him.  
但真嗣一动不动，只是观察着眼前混乱的场面。

His mind was now recalling a scene like this before.  
他的脑海此刻正回放着类似的场景。

Back then, he was with Unit-00, on a compatibility test when something entered his mind, trying to invade him as it was threatening to crack open his skull.  
那时，他与零号机在一起，进行同步率测试时，某种东西侵入了他的意识，试图征服他，仿佛要将他的头颅撕裂。

_He found himself screaming.  
他发现自己正在尖叫。_

"_Ah, what the heck is this?! Something's trying to get into my head! What the hell is it? Ayanami? Rei Ayanami? It's Rei, this consciousness is hers! No, don't do this to me!"_  
“啊，这到底是什么鬼？！有什么东西在试图进入我的脑海！这到底是什么？绫波？绫波丽？这是绫波的意识！不，别这样对我！”

_As he struggled to get this something off his brain, trying to find the ejection handle, warning boxes popped out of the heads-up display and watched the people in the control room panic, attempting to stop Unit-00 from wreaking havoc.  
当他努力从脑海中摆脱这个念头，试图找到弹射把手时，警告框从抬头显示器中弹出，观察着控制室里的人们惊慌失措，试图阻止零号机制造混乱。_

_Before they could shut the whole Eva down, she was trying to punch her way through to strike Rei, who stoically stood there at the control room, watching.  
在他们能完全关闭 Eva 之前，她正试图用拳头冲破障碍去攻击丽，而丽则冷静地站在控制室里，观望着。_

Now it was a terrifying repeat of yesterday, one that he couldn't ignore at all, even as Misato grabbed his wrist and pulled him away, yelling.  
现在这成了昨天恐怖场景的可怕重演，他无法忽视这一切，即使美里抓住他的手腕，拉着他离开，大声喊叫。

_-Shekinah-_

Four minutes later, and lying on her back on a growing puddle of LCL, Rei Ayanami was trying to open her eyes after she heaved the amber liquid out of her system. She could feel her heart beating rapidly as it was attempting to get oxygen circulated back into her system, but there was the remaining rushing edge of adrenaline in her veins.  
四分钟后，躺在逐渐扩大的 LCL 水洼中的绫波零正试图睁开眼睛，她刚刚将体内的琥珀色液体呕吐出来。她能感觉到自己的心跳急速跳动，试图让氧气重新循环到体内，但血管中仍残留着肾上腺素的冲击感。

Kaworu Nagisa was looking down at her, staring with concerned eyes. He managed to revive her through CPR. Klaxons were still sounding the alarm at almost a deafening volume.  
渚薰低头看着她，眼中满是关切。他通过心肺复苏术成功地救醒了她。警报器的声音依旧响亮，几乎震耳欲聋。

"Rei, are you all right?" he asked as he pulled her body up to prop against his chest.  
“丽，你还好吗？”他问道，同时将她的身体拉起，靠在自己的胸前。

The First Children nodded almost weakly, breathing in fresh air. But as she did there was a slight pain in her head, as if something had been pushed into her mind.  
第一子微微点头，几乎显得有些无力，呼吸着新鲜的空气。但就在这时，她的头感到一丝轻微的疼痛，仿佛有什么东西被推入了她的脑海。

It felt strange.

There was a new awareness that she never felt before minutes ago, or even days, until it dawned upon her that perhaps somehow the missing pieces in her were finally put in their rightful place. Thus she felt that a circumstance like this happened previously, and she could now see it in her mind.  
一种几分钟前，甚至几天前都未曾有过的全新意识突然降临在她身上，她意识到或许自己缺失的部分终于归位了。因此，她感觉这种情况似乎以前发生过，现在她能在心中清晰地看到这一幕。

She heard Kaworu whisper into her ear.  
她听到渚薰在她耳边低语。

"I told you I'll be right there by your side," he said. "Hang on there, help is on the way."  
“我说过我会一直在你身边，”他说。“坚持住，救援马上就到。”

Then she faded into unconsciousness as the shock from the trauma overtook her.  
随后，她因创伤带来的冲击而陷入了昏迷。

---

_-Svengali-_

As he watched Kaworu rescue Rei, Gendo Ikari was fully aware that he imagined himself down there, so many months ago before Shinji came.  
当看到渚薰救出绫波时，碇源堂清楚地意识到自己仿佛回到了几个月前，在真嗣到来之前的那段时光。

He was there.

He could vividly remember the moment, the smell of spilled LCL everywhere as he ran across the test floor. Unit-00 was restrained by a solidifying mass of Bakelite on its body, but the Entry Plug was on the floor a few meters away, partly draped by its emergency parachute. He could also remember calling her name out, and then touched the escape hatch.  
他清晰地记得那一刻，测试场上弥漫着溢出的 LCL 的气味，他奔跑着穿过地板。零号机被固化的酚醛树脂牢牢束缚，但其驾驶舱却躺在几米外的地面上，部分被紧急降落伞覆盖。他还记得呼唤她的名字，然后触摸逃生舱门。

_The heated metal seared into his palms, and the burning pain was instantaneous, but he struggled to release the lever and twist it around to open the hatch.  
滚烫的金属灼伤了他的手掌，剧痛即刻袭来，但他仍奋力拉动操纵杆，扭动它以打开舱门。_

_Still clenching his teeth from reacting to the burns on his palms, he crawled inside, trying to reach her and said the words.  
尽管因手掌烧伤而咬紧牙关，他还是爬了进去，试图接近她并说出了那些话。_

"_Rei, are you all right? Rei!"_  
“丽，你还好吗？丽！”

_Gendo could see Rei give him an "I'm okay" nod.  
碇可以看到丽向他点头示意“我没事”。_

_But as he pulled her out, his glasses slipped off his face and fell. The lenses fractured from the hard impact as the glasses bounced until it rested on the floor.  
但当他将她拉出时，他的眼镜从脸上滑落，摔了下去。镜片因强烈的撞击而破裂，眼镜弹跳了几下，最终静止在地板上。_

Now, back to this reality and in the midst of the anarchy, there was a strange feeling in his heart.  
现在，回到这个现实中，在这片混乱之中，他的心中涌起了一种奇异的感觉。

There was little for Commander Gendo Ikari to say as he remained there at the control room, transfixed with this recurrence, watching the paramedics assist them both and lifted Rei onto a waiting stretcher.  
指挥官碇源堂无言以对，他站在控制室里，被这一幕再次发生所吸引，注视着医护人员帮助他们两人，并将绫波丽抬上等候的担架。

---

_-The Hedgehog-_

Shinji could remember another scene as Kaworu pulled Rei out of the Entry Plug. It was almost the same situation but in a different place, on a moonlit night on the slopes of Mount Futagoyama.  
真嗣能记得另一个场景，那是薰将绫波从插入栓中拉出来的时刻。几乎是一样的情形，但地点不同，是在富岳山坡上一个月光皎洁的夜晚。

_As he ran toward the Entry Plug, he saw afar in the middle of Tokyo-3 the smoking carcass of the Angel resting on its side, after he killed it with the Prototype Positron Sniper Rifle. No thanks to the high-energy beam attack of the Angel, Unit-00's SSTO shield was now a molten piece of metal, and that Eva's armor was almost burned off.  
当他跑向插入栓时，远远望见东京-3 的中心，天使的尸体侧卧着，冒着烟，那是他用原型阳电子狙击步枪击杀后的样子。多亏了天使的高能光束攻击，零号机的 SSTO 盾牌如今已熔成了一块金属，而那台 EVA 的装甲几乎被烧毁。_

_The Entry Plug was on the ground, and Shinji struggled to open the hatch. He found Rei sitting there on the cockpit, almost exhausted.  
插入栓躺在地上，真嗣挣扎着打开舱盖。他发现绫波坐在驾驶舱里，几乎筋疲力尽。_

_The sight of her made him cry, as he called her out.  
看到她，他忍不住哭了，呼唤着她的名字。_

"_Ayanami, are you all right? Ayanami!"_  
“绫波，你还好吗？绫波！”

_Rei was speechless. 绫波无言以对。_

"_D… Don't say to me 'I have nothing else'," Shinji pleaded. "Don't say 'goodbye' to me when we go on a mission. Hearing you say those goodbye things is too hard for me."_  
"别……别对我说‘我一无所有’，" 真嗣恳求道。"别在我们执行任务时对我说‘再见’。听到你说那些告别的话，对我来说太难承受了。"

_The Third Children wiped the tears off his cheeks with his arm.  
第三适格者用胳膊擦去了脸颊上的泪水。_

"_Why are you crying?" Rei asked as she watched him weep. "I am sorry. I do not know what to feel at times like this."_  
"你为什么哭呢？" 绫波看着他哭泣问道。"我很抱歉。我不知道在这种时候该有什么感觉。"

_Shinji managed to swallow. "That's okay, I'm too terribly worried about you," he answered. "Come on, I'll get you out of here."  
真嗣勉强咽了咽口水。“没关系，我并不太担心你，”他回答道，“来吧，我带你离开这里。”_

"Are you okay, Shinji?" Misato asked. The young man blinked, now snapped out of his reverie.  
“你还好吗，真嗣？”美里问道。年轻人眨了眨眼，此刻从沉思中回过神来。

"Y… Yes?"

Misato was now staring at him, and Fuyutsuki was just behind her, standing. Both of them were visibly shaken.  
美里现在正盯着他，而冬月则站在她身后，两人都明显受到了震动。

"What has gotten into your head? I told you to take cover!" she reprimanded him loudly.  
"你脑袋里到底在想什么？我告诉过你要找掩护！" 她大声斥责他。

"It… it was like this, just like… this before," Shinji answered, stammering.  
"这…这就像之前那样，就…就是这样，" 真嗣结结巴巴地回答。

Misato shook her head. "Come on, we have to get out of here," she said, grabbing his wrist as they quickly walked out of the observation room.  
美里摇了摇头。"快点，我们得离开这里，" 她说着，抓住他的手腕，两人迅速走出了观察室。

---

The whole control room looked as if a bomb went off outside its armored shell. Dust can also be seen floating in the air, and there were flecks of cement on the floor. Chairs laid askew, papers strewn about, and the thick-layered windows were streaked with great cracks. Outside, the two Evas were silent, sitting squat on the floor as technicians went all over them to check for damage.  
整个控制室看起来仿佛在其装甲外壳外发生了一场爆炸。尘埃在空中飘浮，地板上散落着水泥碎屑。椅子歪斜，文件散落一地，厚重的窗户上布满了巨大的裂痕。外面，两台 EVA 静默地坐在地上，技术人员在其周围四处检查损伤。

Covered with a little dust on his uniform, unconcerned by the total disorder yet brooding, Gendo Ikari was still standing there in the middle of the control room, when the damage control crew began to file in with their rescue and medical equipment. One of them approached him.  
源渡真嗣的制服上沾了些灰尘，对周围的混乱毫不在意却陷入沉思，当损害控制小组带着救援和医疗设备鱼贯而入时，他依然站在控制室的中央。其中一人向他走来。

"Uh, Commander, are you okay, sir?" a corporal asked nervously as everyone else went about trying to assess and clear out the damage.  
“呃，司令，您还好吗，长官？”一名下士紧张地问道，其他人则忙于评估和清理损坏。

Gendo turned to him, glaring, and said, "I'm all right. But let me think, and just leave me alone for a moment. When I'm done, I'll give orders and then I shall leave."  
源度转向他，目光凌厉，说道：“我没事。但让我思考一下，暂时别打扰我。等我想完了，我会下达命令，然后就离开。”

Once the man walked away, Gendo muttered to himself almost quietly, "This is too much of a mistake. She rejected her again… I should have restrained myself in the first place."  
那人走开后，源度几乎轻声自语道：“这错误太大了。她再次拒绝了……我一开始就不该冲动。”

---

The three of them were waiting in the corridor when the Commander went out of the control room, but never gave a glance at their presence as the escort of Second Section agents ringed him instantly. With anger simmering within, Shinji wanted to shout, ask him what really pushed his father to put Rei in harm's way, except Misato restrained firmly with her hands on his shoulders, telling him inwardly to stand down. She whispered into his ears, "Don't."  
"当指挥官走出控制室时，他们三人在走廊里等待着，但他完全没有注意到他们的存在，第二分部的特工们立刻将他团团围住。心中怒火中烧的 Shinji 想要大喊，问他究竟是什么迫使父亲将绫波置于险境，但 Misato 坚定地按住他的肩膀，内心告诉他要忍耐。她在他耳边低语：“别冲动。”

But in the case of Fuyutsuki, all he could do was to wear a scowl on his face. He was also sure after this fiasco Gendo would ask for a small conversation in the quiet secrecy of his office, for he didn't just served as his co-conspirator in this maddening enterprise, but also as a confidant for all of his secrets and aspirations.  
但对于冬月来说，他只能板着脸。他也确信，在这场混乱之后，碇源堂会要求在他的办公室里进行一次私下的小谈话，因为他不仅是碇源堂在这疯狂事业中的共谋者，也是他所有秘密和抱负的知己。

Once the Commander and his escorts disappeared into the crowd of emergency personnel filling up the corridor, Fuyutsuki shook his head in commiseration. _It's all because you're trying to reach Yui_, he reflected.  
当指挥官和他的护卫消失在挤满走廊的应急人员中时，冬月同情地摇了摇头。这一切都是因为你试图接近唯，他反思道。

"Looks like I'll have a lot on my hands," Misato said, breaking the silence. "Start an investigation, debrief everyone, gather info, and write down reports." The older woman shrugged. "I think this is the last time she'll ever be riding an Eva."  
“看来我手头上的事不少，”美里打破了沉默，“开始调查，审问每个人，收集信息，写报告。”年长的女人耸了耸肩，“我想这是她最后一次驾驶 EVA 了。”

"Unit One knows everything," Fuyutsuki concurred, and Shinji nodded, understanding from experience that even in silence, that purple Eva was always listening, feeling... and watching.  
“初号机无所不知，”冬月赞同道，真嗣点头，从经验中明白，即便沉默，那台紫色 Eva 也总是在倾听、感受……以及观察。

---

_-The Messenger- -信使-_

Still wearing his Plug Suit, Kaworu Nagisa was standing by the door to the emergency room where Natsumi Odani and the ER team went about checking Rei. He was also contemplating about what happened back there, especially with the psychic rush.  
依旧身着插入栓服的渚薰站在急诊室的门口，那里夏见音和急诊团队正在检查绫波的情况。他也在思考刚才发生的事情，尤其是那股心灵冲击。

_Before, I didn't find anything from her,_ he reflected. _Her mind is almost a blank slate and as much as I tried, I couldn't bring her memories back._  
以前，我从她身上找不到任何东西，他思索着。她的心智几乎是一片空白，尽管我尽力尝试，却无法唤回她的记忆。

Kaworu sighed. _But today, all the sudden she has all these memories, and what else, I think I have come to see that her mind has great depth and she has secrets to tell. There's much for me to do, however, to sort all this out until I have a coherent picture._  
渚薰叹了口气。但今天，她突然拥有了所有这些记忆，不仅如此，我觉得我已经开始意识到她的内心深处藏着许多秘密。要理清这一切，直到形成一个连贯的画面，我还有很多工作要做。

He grimaced slightly, as an unlikely idea hit him. He pictured the fierce, unblinking scowl of Unit-01.  
他微微皱眉，一个不太可能的想法击中了他。他想象着初号机那凶狠、不眨眼的怒容。

_Has this Eva anything to do with Rei's condition right now? Is it possible that it… no, she can alter the minds of anyone inside in different ways, apart from psychological contamination?  
这个 Eva 与绫波现在的状况有关吗？有没有可能它……不，她能以不同方式影响内部任何人的心智，除了心理污染之外？_

_Maybe the Lilim who made the Evas know only a mere fraction of understanding of all their functions and their potential, as they are very complex creatures.  
或许制造 Eva 的人类（Lilim）只了解它们功能和潜力的冰山一角，因为它们是非常复杂的生物。_

_Like my brethren before me.  
就像我之前的同胞们一样。_

_It's obvious that Lilim are still too young to understand, especially with their science.  
显然，莉莉姆们还是太年轻，无法理解，尤其是关于科学方面。_

_No,_ Kaworu shook his head, disagreeing with that conclusion. _Even I am also trying to understand the extent of my own capability. Literally, I'm feeling my way around._  
不，薰摇了摇头，不同意这个结论。即便是我，也在努力理解自己能力的极限。实际上，我正在摸索前进。

After talking to one of the nurses, Natsumi walked up and came out of the doorway. Standing before him, she gave Kaworu a mild smile.  
在与一位护士交谈后，夏美走上前，从门口出来。站在他面前，她对薰露出了一个温和的微笑。

"Don't worry too much, Mister Nagisa," Natsumi said. "She's out of danger. Besides that Unit One rejected her completely, she also suffered from was oxygen deprivation and eventual asphyxation due to high levels of carbon dioxide in the LCL, so I suspect a malfunction somewhere in the Entry Plug subsystems."  
"别太担心，渚先生，" 夏美说。"她已经脱离危险了。除了初号机完全排斥她之外，她还遭受了氧气不足和因 LCL 中高浓度二氧化碳导致的最终窒息，所以我怀疑插入栓子系统某处出现了故障。"

"I see, ma'am," Kaworu said. "Can there be any other problems?"  
"我明白了，女士，" 薰说。"还有其他问题吗？"

"For now, I'm due to have her go through an MRI and a brain scan to check for brain damage and maybe some psychological contamination, but given the very short amount of time she was out of air, I believe that the possibility of such trauma could be small. I hope she could survive that, too."  
"目前，我安排她去做 MRI 和脑部扫描，检查是否有脑损伤或可能的心理污染，但考虑到她缺氧的时间非常短，我认为这种创伤的可能性很小。我也希望她能挺过这一关。"

Kaworu nodded. "Thank you very much, Doctor. I'll wait for her."  
渚薰点头。“非常感谢，医生。我会等她的。”

"Good. Oh, by the way," Natsumi spoke, "…Thanks for saving the day. If it weren't for you, things could've gotten out of control."  
“很好。哦，对了，”夏美说道，“……谢谢你救了场。如果不是你，情况可能会失控。”

"My pleasure," Kaworu answered, as the young doctor then went back in to begin treating Rei. A nurse placed an oxygen mask over the girl's mouth, and another nurse hooked up an IV line and a bottle of dextrose.  
“乐意之至，”渚薰回答，年轻的医生随即返回开始治疗绫波。一名护士给女孩戴上氧气面罩，另一名护士接上静脉注射管和一瓶葡萄糖。

Kaworu looked on and sank into self-reflection. He never thought that even for someone like him so used to perfection and in a cloistered life, he was left shaken by today's incident. It would no longer be possible for him to be indifferent to the sufferings of others around him; he'll have to respond.  
渚薰凝视着，陷入了沉思。他从未想过，即便是像他这样习惯了完美且过着隐居生活的人，也会被今天的事件所动摇。他再也无法对周围人的苦难无动于衷；他必须做出回应。

What is the point of living if one can't reciprocate kindly with the other?  
如果一个人不能以善意回报他人，那么活着的意义何在？

If that was the case, then Lilim could be baser beings than animals, as most animals are rarely solitary creatures and depend on each other's existence. This is what referred to as symbiosis to create a working ecosystem. As Kaworu needed to win their trust, he must first show his compassion to them as a means of symbiosis.  
如果是这样的话，那么人类可能比动物更为低等，因为大多数动物很少是独居生物，它们依赖彼此的存在。这就是所谓的共生，以创造一个运作良好的生态系统。由于渚薰需要赢得他们的信任，他必须首先向他们展示自己的同情心，作为共生的一种手段。

Now his rescue of Rei Ayanami was the initial clear act of mercy.  
如今，他拯救绫波零的举动成为了最初的明确善行。

At the Children's locker room, Kaworu Nagisa was in the shower, letting the warm water splash on his head and to ease the ache from the day's near-catastrophe in the Eva testing facility. With hands pushed against the wall, head bowed downward, he was also thinking and recalling those images and voices in his mind.  
在儿童更衣室里，渚薰正在淋浴，任由温暖的水花洒在头上，缓解着一天中在 EVA 测试设施里差点酿成的灾难所带来的疼痛。他双手撑着墙，头低垂着，同时也在思考并回忆着脑海中的那些画面和声音。

In fact, he was seeing things and experiences from Rei's point of view.  
实际上，他正从绫波的视角体验着那些事物和经历。

He could see a completely bandaged right arm and an eye patch as Rei looked at herself in the mirror (_Is this her home?_ Kaworu told himself, noticing that her room was dimly-lit and somewhat grimy). She then turned to the left and walked towards the cabinet containing her clothes, and on top was a bunch of thick books and an eyeglass case.  
他可以看到丽完全包扎的右臂和眼罩，她正对着镜子打量自己（这是她的家吗？真嗣暗自思忖，注意到她的房间光线昏暗且有些脏乱）。随后，她转向左边，走向装有她衣物的柜子，柜子顶上堆放着几本厚书和一个眼镜盒。

Rei opened the case and took out the glasses, which were cracked and had a slightly-worn look. She held them in her palm and then caressed the gold-rimmed frame as if she was trying to remember the time they were given to her (_Whose glasses are those? They look familiar… Only someone use such eyeglasses. Do they belong to the Commander?_).  
丽打开盒子，取出那副眼镜，镜片裂了，看起来有些磨损。她将它们握在掌心，轻轻抚摸着金边镜框，仿佛在试图回忆它们被赠予的时刻（这些是谁的眼镜？看起来很眼熟……只有某人会戴这样的眼镜。它们属于司令吗？）。

Teardrops fell from Rei's cheeks, spattering the lenses.  
泪珠从丽的脸颊滑落，溅在镜片上。

Kaworu suddenly shut off the shower with a twist, and sat onto the tiled floor. He was now blinking, trying to go deeper to seek more of her thoughts.  
渚薰突然一扭关掉了淋浴，坐在瓷砖地板上。他现在眨着眼睛，试图更深入地探寻她的思绪。

Another image from Rei's life: sitting on a bench, under the afternoon sun, she was reading what appeared to be an impenetrable treatise on molecular biology, all written in German. The First Children wasn't fazed by the text, as if she was comfortably reading a paperback novel, when a shadow blotted out the pages.  
另一幅来自绫波零生活的画面：坐在长椅上，沐浴在午后的阳光中，她正在阅读一本看似深奥的分子生物学论文，全都是德文写的。第一适格者对这些文字毫不畏惧，仿佛在轻松地阅读一本平装小说，这时一片阴影遮住了书页。

Rei turned to confront the blatant intruder of her personal space. It was a girl in a uniform just like hers, alert blue eyes and long red hair with color-matched interface headsets. Behind that girl was a growing crowd of Tokyo-3 Junior High School students, watching the newcomer with great interest as if it the tableau was a soap opera being played out.  
绫波转过身来面对这个公然闯入她私人空间的人。那是一个和她穿着同样制服的女孩，警觉的蓝眼睛和长长的红发，头上戴着颜色相配的接口头带。在那个女孩身后，是一群越来越多的第三新东京市立中学的学生，他们饶有兴趣地看着这位新人，仿佛这场面是一出正在上演的肥皂剧。

_It's Pilot Soryu,_ Kaworu told himself.  
这是驾驶员惣流，碇真嗣告诉自己。

_"Hello!" Asuka greeted, perky and cheerful. "You must be Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the Unit Zero Prototype. I'm Asuka! Asuka Langley Souryu. I'm the pilot of Eva Unit Two. Let's be good friends!"  
"你好！"明日香热情洋溢地打招呼，"你一定是零号机原型机的驾驶员绫波零。我是明日香！惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我是二号机的驾驶员。让我们成为好朋友吧！"_

_"Why?" Rei questioned as if her reading pleasure was gravely disrupted. The red eyes narrowed.  
"为什么？"绫波问道，仿佛她的阅读乐趣被严重打断了。红色的眼睛眯了起来。_

_Asuka grinned. "Because it'd be so convenient for both of us," she replied, "as we're in the same business."  
明日香咧嘴一笑。“因为这对我们俩都很方便，”她回答道，“毕竟我们做的是同一行。”_

_There was a tense moment of silence as Rei pondered for an appropriate response.  
一阵紧张的沉默中，丽在思考着合适的回应。_

_"If I am ordered to, I will," she answered blankly, and returned to pick up where she was interrupted. She could also hear Asuka make a loud remark: "Talk about strange. Why?"  
“如果我被命令这么做，我会执行，”她平淡地回答，然后回到被打断的地方继续。她还能听到明日香大声评论：“真是奇怪，为什么？”_

_"That is all I can say," Rei answered without leaving her eyes from the book.  
“我能说的就这么多，”丽回答，目光始终没有离开书本。_

Kaworu shook his head and stood up, pulling a towel from the rack. As he dried himself, the next thing he will have to do is to keep an eye on Rei, presently unconscious in Room 300 at the Infirmary.  
渚薰摇了摇头，站起身来，从架子上取下一条毛巾。他一边擦干身体，接下来要做的事情就是留意昏迷在医务室 300 号房间的绫波零。

In her unconscious state, Rei imagined she was naked, in a deep ocean, sinking slowly into abyssal depths, the only bluish-white light somehow emanating from her body, illuminating a cliff face. She couldn't move her limbs, but her eyes seeing only that rocky blue cliff and the darkness beyond her.  
在昏迷状态中，绫波零想象自己赤裸着，身处深海，缓缓沉入无底的深渊，唯一的蓝白色光芒似乎从她体内散发出来，照亮了一面峭壁。她无法动弹四肢，但她的眼睛只能看到那蓝色的岩石峭壁和外面的黑暗。

_Where am I going down to?_ Rei pondered. _Why am I here for?_  
我要沉向何方？丽思索着。我为何在此？

Bubble streamed from her mouth, but there was no sensation of drowning, as the water felt more like it was LCL enriched with oxygen. There was nothing except for her existence, until she heard a strange, deep cry from the bluish darkness.  
气泡从她口中涌出，但没有溺水的感觉，因为水更像是富含氧气的 LCL。除了她的存在，别无他物，直到她听到从蓝色黑暗中传来的奇怪而深沉的哭声。

It wasn't human at all.  
那根本不是人类。

Nor an Angel or something, as a hulking shadow or three slowly stood out. They were long and huge, with their flukes slowly pushing them forward. She could now recognize their shapes.  
也不是天使之类的存在，而是三个庞大的阴影缓缓站起。它们身形修长且巨大，尾鳍缓慢地推动着它们前进。她现在能辨认出它们的轮廓。

_Whales. I have read or heard about them somewhere... Maybe in school?  
鲸鱼。我在哪里读到过或听说过它们... 也许是在学校？  
Why I am thinking of whales?  
为何我会想到鲸鱼？  
Is this my imagination? 这是我的想象吗？_

They were engaged in a very complex conversation in deep, basso calls, almost loud enough to be heard thousands of kilometers away. As Rei's illumination shone light on the whales, they were a family of humpbacks, the largest of their kind.  
它们正用深沉的低音进行一场极为复杂的对话，几乎响亮到能在数千公里外被听见。随着丽的光芒照亮鲸群，它们是一群座头鲸，同类中体型最大的。

One of those whales seemed to be staring at her with interest, but Rei wasn't sure how she could approach these creatures. Maybe she could reach out to their skin with a hand, so suddenly she was able to do it and touch the whale closest to her.  
其中一头鲸鱼似乎正饶有兴趣地盯着她，但丽并不确定该如何接近这些生物。也许她可以伸手去触摸它们的皮肤，于是她突然鼓起勇气，触碰了离她最近的那头鲸鱼。

The huge creature responded with a soothing, long and low voice, the sound echoing against the cliff wall and scattering to other directions.  
这巨大的生物以一种舒缓、悠长而低沉的声音回应，声音在峭壁间回荡，并向四周散去。

With growing curiosity, Rei kicked her legs to go near, and she was close enough to try caressing its skin. She couldn't tell what was in the whale's mind as she petted it, but the creature didn't seem to mind, contented with her presence.  
带着越发浓烈的好奇心，丽踢动双腿靠近，直到足够近去尝试抚摸它的皮肤。她无法得知鲸鱼心中的想法，但当她抚摸它时，这生物似乎并不介意，满足于她的存在。

The smaller of the whales swam beneath her, as if it wanted to interact.  
较小的那头鲸鱼在她下方游动，仿佛想要互动。

Then a thought crept into Rei, and she could imagine Shinji's face swimming into view, speaking to her.  
随后一个念头悄然潜入丽的脑海，她能想象出真嗣的面容浮现眼前，向她说话。

_"Why are you doing this?" Shinji asked.  
“你为什么要这么做？”真嗣问道。_

The scene changed into where she was wearing a Plug Suit, sitting on a tall scaffold standing besides Unit-00. She could see the moon above the horizon in its full shining glory; to her left, Shinji was a few meters away, also sitting on his own platform besides Unit-01. He was looking at her right in the eyes.  
场景转换，她身着插入栓服，坐在高高的脚手架上，旁边是零号机。她能看到地平线上满月闪耀着光辉；在她左边，几米之外的碇真嗣也坐在自己的平台上，旁边是一号机。他正直视着她的眼睛。

_"Because it is my bond," Rei answered.  
“因为这是我的羁绊，”绫波回答道。  
Shinji frowned in wonderment. "A bond?"  
"Yes, it is a bond. But..."  
“是的，这是一份羁绊。但是……”  
"This is a bond to my father?"  
"这是给我的父亲的信物？"  
"It is to all other people."  
"对其他人来说是的。"  
Shinji smiled, apparently in admiration for what he percieved as erudition.  
真嗣微笑着，显然是对他所认为的博学表示赞赏。  
"I... You're strong, Ayanami."  
"我... 你很强，绫波。"  
Rei shook her head slowly. "I have nothing else."  
绫波缓缓摇头。"我别无他物。"  
Shinji blinked. "You have nothing else? But why?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。"你别无他物？但为什么？"  
The blue-haired girl glanced at the watch on her wrist, the digits displaying 11:59 PM. "It is time," Rei announced. "We must go now, but I have to say goodbye."  
蓝发女孩瞥了一眼手腕上的手表，数字显示为晚上 11:59。“时间到了，”丽宣布，“我们必须现在出发，但我得说声再见。”_

The scene dissolved into darkness, replacing with only her with the humpbacks swimming close for contact.  
场景渐渐融入黑暗，取而代之的是她与座头鲸们亲密接触的画面。

_Goodbye,_ Rei thought. _For I can be replaced when I die?_  
再见，丽心想。难道我死后就会被取代吗？

For a moment she could see Kaworu's face, gazing downward at her, his face displaying concern but reassuring. His red eyes told her of his sympathy.  
有那么一刻，她能看到渚薰的脸，正俯视着她，脸上流露出关切却又令人安心的神情。他那双红色的眼睛向她传达着同情。

_I do not know now, but as I have seen his face it means that I am alive, that it also seems I could even remember almost everything. I existed because...  
我现在不知道，但当我看到他的脸时，这意味着我还活着，似乎我甚至能记得几乎所有的事情。我存在是因为...  
Not because for the Commander needs me, but because of Nagisa.  
并非因为司令需要我，而是因为渚。  
No, I cannot return yet.  
不，我还不能回去。  
I do not understand, except this time I need Nagisa.  
我不明白，只是这次我需要渚。  
Because I feel blind; I have forgotten. Lost memories, helpless, useless, worthless; I am supposed to die and be replaced...  
因为我感到盲目；我忘记了。失去的记忆，无助，无用，无价值；我本该死去，被取代……_

_No,_ Rei disagreed. _There is something in Nagisa that has kept me alive…  
不，丽反对道。渚身上有某种东西让我一直活下去……  
His kindness, that openness, the understanding.  
他的善意，那份坦诚，那种理解。_

Commander Ikari's face appeared, seemingly unsympathetic to all others except before her presence.  
碇司令的面孔出现了，似乎对其他人都不为所动，唯独在她面前例外。

_Are those actions also present in the Commander?  
指挥官身上也有这些行为吗？  
I do not know. 我不清楚。_

Rei imagined Commander Ikari standing before Shinji, cowering on the floor in total fear as the older man glared with complete indifference to the boy's mumbling not to run away.  
丽想象着碇司令站在真嗣面前，少年恐惧地蜷缩在地上，而年长的男人则冷漠地瞪着他，对男孩喃喃自语着不要逃跑的话语完全无动于衷。

_I do not even know what kind of person the Commander truly is, although Ikari is too afraid of him.  
我甚至不知道司令真正的为人，尽管真嗣对他怕得要命。_

But this scene dimmed away as another was suddenly illuminated, of Kaworu standing before her, smiling softly with arms wide open. He spoke:  
但这一幕渐渐淡去，另一幅画面突然亮起，是薰站在她面前，微笑着张开双臂。他说道：

_"If anything happens to you, I'll be there at your side."  
“如果你有什么事，我会在你身边。”_

The Kaworu Nagisa in her mind nodded.  
她心中的渚薰点了点头。

"_Trust me on this; I'm ready for you… so try to be at least strong."_  
“在这件事上相信我；我已经准备好面对你了……所以至少要坚强些。”

Then everything dimmed around Rei, the dream world fading into nothing.  
随后，周围的一切都暗淡下来，梦境世界逐渐消散于无形。

At the Data Analysis Room in Central Dogma, they were all reviewing the data acquired during the failed mutual compatibility test. Makoto Hyuga was in control of the room's largest analysis workstation, which resembled a soup-up version of a professional video-editing suite; it consisted of a very powerful computer with massive hard drives and multiple display monitors. Behind him was Misato, Shinji, Natsumi Odani and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, all of them were looking at the monitors displaying the data in separate sections.  
在中央教条区的数据分析室内，他们正在回顾那次失败的同步适配测试中获取的数据。真嗣·日向掌控着房间内最大的分析工作站，这台设备酷似专业视频编辑工作站的升级版，配备了一台性能极强的电脑，拥有大容量硬盘和多块显示器。在他身后，分别是美里、真嗣、音波奈津美和副司令冬月，他们都盯着屏幕上分块显示的数据。

Every Eva test is recorded into a fully-digitized log file which included the following information: video, audio and data (locomotor, vital signs, sync rate, LCL condition, bioelectrical activity, etc.) streams obtained from remote sensors and cameras present in the Entry Plug, the pilot's Plug Suit, the Eva (or any of the simulation bodies) and the control room; the video streams even have their own timestamps and the camera location.  
每次 Eva 测试都会记录到一个完全数字化的日志文件中，包含以下信息：从插入栓、驾驶员的插入服、Eva（或任何模拟体）以及控制室中的远程传感器和摄像头获取的视频、音频和数据（运动、生命体征、同步率、LCL 状态、生物电活动等）流；视频流甚至有自己的时间戳和摄像头位置。

However, at the moment, Shinji had little to say except he was trying to catch onto what the others were talking about; some of the technobabble was beyond his comprehension, let alone for the fact that Unit-01 finally went south on Rei.  
然而，眼下，真嗣几乎无话可说，除了他正努力跟上其他人讨论的内容；一些技术术语超出了他的理解范围，更不用说初号机最终对绫波产生了负面影响。

"Okay," Misato said. "Let's see what we have in there."  
“好的，”美里说，“让我们看看里面有什么。”

Fuyutsuki and Natsumi nodded, as Makoto pressed the Play button on the control console.  
冬月和夏美点头，真琴按下了控制台上的播放按钮。

For the first minute everything appeared to be normal. Rei was waiting patiently as the LCL filled up her Entry Plug, and the data showed everything in a typical startup routine: a slow rise in figures as the lines climbed.  
最初的一分钟里，一切似乎都很正常。丽耐心地等待着 LCL 充满她的插入栓，数据显示一切都在典型的启动程序中：随着线条攀升，数值缓慢上升。

Then at the critical point of attempting to clear the Borderline, on the video streams Unit-01 tore off the arm restraints while Rei was suddenly caught in a seizure, mouth wide open as if she wanted to scream, her hands apparently trying to hold her neck as though she was being strangled. At the same point the EEG and ECG graphs showed a sharp increase in brain and heart activity, almost beyond tolerance; LCL oxygen levels dropped sharply with a corresponding increase in LCL internal pressure.  
然后在尝试清除临界点的关键时刻，视频流显示 01 号机撕掉了手臂束缚，而零突然陷入抽搐，嘴巴大张仿佛要尖叫，双手似乎在试图抓住自己的脖子，好像被勒住一样。与此同时，脑电图和心电图显示大脑和心脏活动急剧增加，几乎超出耐受范围；LCL 氧气水平急剧下降，同时 LCL 内部压力相应增加。

"Pause it right there, Lieutenant," Natsumi Odani ordered Makoto. "It looks likes psychological contamination, but this one's different. We've never seen anything like this before."  
“停在这里，中尉，”夏美·小谷命令真琴。“看起来像是心理污染，但这次不同。我们以前从未见过这种情况。”

Misato frowned. "How can you be sure that this is a different case?"  
美里皱起眉头。“你怎么能确定这是一个不同的案例？”

"It appears that there's very high activity in the hippocampus, which concerns about long-term memory," Natsumi said, pointing out the displayed EEG graph.  
“似乎海马体有非常高的活动，这涉及到长期记忆的问题，”夏美指着显示的脑电图说。

Natsumi let her hand hold her chin, thinking. "We'll need more data to be sure if this is the case, especially the previous compatibility test logs, but to make it simple I think Unit One may have forced whatever information into Ayanami's brain."  
夏美用手托着下巴，思考着。“我们需要更多的数据来确定是否如此，特别是之前的兼容性测试日志，但简单来说，我认为初号机可能强行将某些信息植入了绫波的脑中。”

Misato turned to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, who was silently watching most of the time. "Sir, what do you think?" she asked.  
美里转向副指挥官冬月，他大部分时间都在默默观察。“长官，您怎么看？”她问道。

"Play it again," Fuyutsuki commanded, and Makoto rewound and played the digital log file once more. This time he was focusing on the cameras overlooking the control room and the test chamber. While Unit-01 was blasting the windows with her fists, each punch appeared to be directed at Commander Ikari.  
“再放一遍，”冬月命令道，真希波重新倒带并再次播放了数字日志文件。这次他专注于监控控制室和试验舱的摄像头。当零号机用拳头猛击窗户时，每一拳似乎都是冲着碇司令去的。

"I'm not sure what caused this to happen, but looks like the Eva's angry at him," he remarked. "Why he didn't move an inch?"  
“我不确定是什么导致了这种情况，但看起来 EVA 对他很生气，”他评论道。“为什么他一动不动？”

Makoto shrugged. "I don't know, sir," he answered. "We rushed out just as hell broke loose, except the Commander stayed on to watch. I told him to get out but he didn't. I suppose that he's remembering what happened months ago, when Unit Zero went berserk on us."  
真琴耸了耸肩。“我不知道，长官，”他回答，“我们刚乱成一团就冲出来了，除了司令留下来观察。我让他离开但他没走。我想他是在回忆几个月前，零号机对我们发狂的那件事。”

"I see," Fuyutsuki said before he turned to Natsumi. "Just as you said that this is an unusual case of contamination, you know diagnostic tests will be appropriate."  
“我明白了，”冬月说，然后转向夏美，“正如你所说，这是一种不寻常的污染情况，你知道诊断测试是合适的。”

"I did," Natsumi confirmed. "I put her through an MRI scan immediately after ER treatment."  
“是的，”夏美确认道，“我在紧急处理后立即给她做了 MRI 扫描。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Good. While you're at it, as I'm sure you also have the necessary clearances, try to see if there are any previous cases involving the First Children's brain activity."  
冬月点了点头。"好的。既然你也有必要的权限，试着查查有没有涉及第一适格者脑部活动的过往案例。"

"Yes, sir," Natsumi agreed.  
"是，长官，"夏美同意道。"

As the others went on talking, Misato approached Shinji and told him, "While we're trying to unscrew this mess, maybe you should try visiting Ayanami downstairs," she suggested. "I think this is the right time to make up for all the trouble between you and her," she added, referring to his soul-tearing dilemma after the Dummy Plug Plant incident.  
其他人继续交谈时，美里走向真嗣，对他说："在我们试图解决这个烂摊子的时候，也许你应该去楼下看看绫波，"她建议道。"我觉得现在是弥补你和她之间所有麻烦的合适时机，"她补充说，指的是在模拟插入栓工厂事件后他内心的痛苦挣扎。

Shinji nodded. "O... Okay, I'll do," he responded. "I don't think I'll have something worthwhile to do here."  
真嗣点点头。"嗯...好的，我会做的，"他回答。"我觉得在这里没有什么有意义的事情可做。"

Once the Third Children left them alone, Fuyutsuki focused on Misato. "Should we ever get stumped on this one," he said. "I have someone in mind who can easily give us some answers."  
当第三适格者离开后，冬月将注意力转向美里。"如果我们在这个问题上遇到瓶颈，"他说，"我有个合适的人选，能轻易给我们一些答案。"

This time Rei found herself sitting on a folding chair, a bluish-white spotlight trained down on her. In what place she didn't know.  
这次丽发现自己坐在一把折叠椅上，一束蓝白色的聚光灯打在她身上。她不知道自己身处何地。

_Why am I here? Where am I?_ She inquired, slowly turning her head to see if there was anyone else besides her, before it dawned upon Rei that she was alone.  
我为何在此？我在何方？她缓缓转动头部，探看是否还有他人相伴，直到丽意识到自己孑然一身。

And she heard herself speaking from somewhere.  
而她听见自己的声音从某处传来。

"_My heart, so much as to become distraught."  
“我的心，竟至如此纷乱。”  
"My heart desiring bonds with people."  
"我的心渴望与人建立联系。"  
"Before I even knew it, I was… trembling… struggling… bleeding… gasping… and to realize in this final moment."  
"在我意识到之前，我已经在...颤抖...挣扎...流血...喘息...而在这最后的时刻才恍然大悟。"_

**-FLASH!-**

The scene was changed again, but this time Rei was in an Entry Plug, in another place and time, and another reason being there. She could hear herself reciting what amounted to a monologue while images flashed before her.  
场景再次变换，但这次丽身处插入栓内，在另一个时空，出于另一个原因。她能听到自己在背诵一段近乎独白的台词，同时眼前闪过一幅幅画面。

_Mountain. Heavy are the mountains,

Rei saw herself before a mirror, red eyes staring, inquiring as she tried to unlock her own personal enigma.  
丽在镜前看见自己，红眸凝视，探询着试图解开自身谜团。

_Who is this? This is me.  
这是谁？这就是我。  
Who am I? What am I? What am I? What am I? What am I?  
我是谁？我是什么？我是什么？我是什么？我是什么？

Who is there before me?

Images of persons that interacted with Rei rushed before her, starting with Shinji.  
与丽互动过的人的影像在她眼前闪过，首先是真嗣。

_Ikari.  
I know this person. Major Katsuragi.  
我认识这个人。葛城美里少校。  
Doctor Akagi. 赤木医生。  
People, my classmates. 人们，我的同学们。  
The pilot of Unit Two.  
二号机的驾驶员。  
Commander Ikari. 碇司令。  
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?  
你是谁？你是谁？你是谁？_

**-FLASH!-**

Once again Rei was back in the Entry Plug, but the throbbing veins were all over her body, tightening as the Angel tried to fuse into her. But this point of view flickered as if it was being slown down. Still fighting to be alive, she glanced to her right, catching a glimpse of Shinji and Unit-01 struggling to stop the Angel from fusing with the Eva.  
雷又一次回到了插入栓中，但她的全身布满了跳动的血管，随着使徒试图与她融合而紧绷。但这个视角闪烁着，仿佛被放慢了。她仍在为生存而挣扎，向右一瞥，瞥见了真嗣和初号机正努力阻止使徒与 Eva 融合。

Rei's heart ached with the intense longing.  
丽的心因强烈的渴望而隐隐作痛。

_Is that my heart? 那是我的心吗？_

Lonely tears were flowing away from her eyes.  
孤独的泪水从她的眼中流淌而出。

_Do I need to unify myself with Ikari?  
我需要与碇君合为一体吗？_

She could also hear the overriding electronic hum amidst the beeping alarms, comlink yells, the thunder of battle, and blinking warning signs. The displays flickered as weakening power surged throughout the Eva.  
她还能听到在哔哔作响的警报声、通讯器中的呼喊声、战斗的轰鸣声和闪烁的警告标志中，那压倒一切的电子嗡鸣声。随着力量在 Eva 中减弱，显示屏也闪烁不定。

_No._

The comlink window appeared, but it wasn't Shinji who was onscreen.  
通讯窗口出现了，但屏幕上的并非真嗣。

Kaworu Nagisa, in Unit-02, was silently trying to save her, mouthing her full name as he fought to stop Unit-01 from hurting Rei, even as her sight began to wax and wane.  
渚薰，在二号机中，默默地试图拯救她，一边与阻止初号机伤害绫波的冲动作斗争，一边无声地念出她的全名，尽管她的视线开始时明时暗。

The scene changed, from the forest where she made her last stand, to the concrete confines of the Test Facility, the wide field of vision and lateral G-forces gyrating from side to side. Rei was becoming nauseous, the extreme violent movements trying to kill her inside.  
场景变换，从她最后坚守的森林转到了试验设施的混凝土围墙内，广阔的视野和侧向的 G 力左右摇摆。绫波感到恶心，这些极端暴力的动作试图从内部杀死她。

And then darkness fell upon her, ending the overwhelming shock and roll.  
随后黑暗降临于她，终结了那股压倒性的震惊与翻滚。

---

Rei slowly began to open her eyes, to find herself staring at Kaworu. Then she turned her head slowly to find out she was in one of the Infirmary rooms. She was on the bed, on a slightly upright position, and she felt a needle stuck to her arm, leading to a hanging IV dextrose bottle. Kaworu, now wearing his school uniform, was sitting right next to her. He was going to be her babysitter for the day.  
绫波缓缓睁开双眼，发现自己正盯着渚。然后她慢慢转过头，发现自己身处一间医务室房间。她躺在床上，处于略微直立的位置，感觉到手臂上扎着一根针，连接着悬挂的葡萄糖点滴瓶。渚此时已换上校服，正坐在她旁边。他将成为她今天的看护人。

"Hello," Kaworu greeted. "How are you feeling?"  
“你好，”渚问候道，“感觉如何？”

Rei didn't know what to say, trying to find the right words.  
绫波不知该说什么，努力寻找合适的词句。

"I feel weak…" she mumbled.  
"我感觉很虚弱……" 她喃喃道。

"You have been rejected by Unit One," Kaworu said, "and you were also unconscious for about two hours."  
"你被第一部队拒绝了，" 渚薰说，"而且你还昏迷了大约两个小时。"

"I also have this strange feeling inside."  
“我内心也有这种奇怪的感觉。”

"What is it?" he inquired, slightly puzzled.  
"这是怎么了？" 他略带困惑地问道。

Rei moved her right hand to the chest, just over her heart.  
丽将右手移到胸前，正好放在心脏的位置。

"I… I… I feel I could remember," she answered, feeling every heartbeat on her palm. Tears were starting to well from her eyes, as she let her mind begin to flashback almost every image of her memories:  
"我……我……我觉得我能记起来，" 她回答道，感受着掌心下每一次心跳。泪水开始从她的眼中涌出，随着她的思绪开始回溯，几乎每一段记忆的画面都闪现在她脑海中：

_Testing Unit Zero, and Gendo's rescue;

“如果我放手...我的 AT 力场永远无法控制它...力场将会瓦解...我...我必须坚持住...”_

"Ayanami, what's wrong?" Kaworu asked almost quietly as he moved closer. "Are you all right?"  
“绫波，怎么了？”渚薰几乎轻声问道，同时靠近了些。“你还好吗？”

"I am the Third," Rei answered, tears cascading her pale cheeks. "I can remember now. Almost everything. What I have thought I have forgotten or lost, the emptiness has been filled in."  
"我是第三适格者，" 绫波回答，泪水顺着她苍白的脸颊滑落，"我现在能记起来了，几乎所有的事情。那些我以为我已经忘记或失去的，空虚已经被填补了。"

Rei sat upright and faced Kaworu, eye to eye.  
绫波坐直了身子，直视着渚薰，目光相接。

"I have now realized the reason for my tears," she declared.  
"我现在明白了流泪的原因，"她宣称。

The numerous faces of Shinji, in different moods and different times, rushed before her eyes.  
不同情绪、不同时刻的真嗣的面孔，纷纷涌现在她眼前。

Kaworu looked baffled. "I don't understand," he whispered.  
渚薰看起来很困惑。"我不明白，"他低声说。

Rei shook her head in disagreement, and then she looked deeply into Kaworu's eyes.  
丽摇了摇头表示不同意，然后她深深地凝视着渚的眼睛。

"In many ways… you remind me of Ikari," she replied.  
“在很多方面……你让我想起了碇，”她回答道。

Thousands of kilometers away, Keel Lorenz was fuming, as his cup of tea was untouched for nearly ten minutes. On his desk was a brief report about today's Unit-01 fiasco, the covert source saying that the First Children failed to achieve compatibility.  
数千公里之外，基尔·洛伦兹正怒火中烧，他的茶杯已经近十分钟未曾动过。桌子上放着一份关于今天零号机失败的简报，消息来源称第一适格者未能达成同步。

"This isn't what I expect from him," Keel muttered. "He suddenly makes a rash decision costing millions, and in the process he fails."  
“这不是我所期待的他的表现，”基尔低声抱怨，“他突然做出一个鲁莽的决定，损失了数百万，结果还失败了。”

The SEELE chairman typed in a few commands on the keyboard to bring up Commander Gendo Ikari's very extensive file on the main display. It showed his full picture, some important information and a biography. Keel opened some older sub-documents, which included Gendo's criminal record (and since then purged after pulling some powerful strings in the Japanese political hierarchy): assault and battery; public disturbance; resisting arrest; disorderly conduct. Hell, he was even responsible for starting at least ten barroom brawls, breaking jaws and heads while studying at Kyoto.  
SEELE 主席在键盘上敲了几下，调出了指挥官碇源堂极其详尽的档案，显示在主屏幕上。档案中包括他的全貌照片、一些重要信息和生平简介。基尔打开了一些更早的子文档，其中包括碇源堂的犯罪记录（后来在日本政治高层的某些有力关系下被清除）：殴打和人身攻击；公共场所扰乱秩序；拒捕；行为不检。天哪，他在京都求学期间甚至至少引发了十次酒吧斗殴，打碎过不少下巴和脑袋。

Keel shook his head. _He's always a rebel from the start. I once used to admire his style, sacrificing moral complexities to accomplish an objective._  
基尔摇了摇头。他从一开始就是个叛逆者。我曾一度欣赏他的风格，为了达成目标不惜牺牲道德上的复杂性。

There were more files, this time dating back to Ikari's teenage days. School records (in Gendo's old surname) told of multiple reprimands from principals, another score of transfers after cases of bullying and fistfights. These were a sharp contrast to the exceptionally high scores on the report cards, his hard intellect that saved him from almost being expelled.  
还有更多文件，这次追溯到碇的青少年时期。学校记录（使用的是源堂旧姓）显示了多次来自校长的训斥，以及因欺凌和斗殴事件而导致的多次转学。这些与成绩单上异常高的分数形成了鲜明对比，他坚硬的智慧使他几乎免于被开除。

The old man sighed. "When you combine cold intelligence," he told himself, "with a dangerous fighting personality of a wild animal, trouble always follows."  
老人叹了口气。“当冷酷的智慧，”他自言自语道，“与野兽般危险的战斗性格结合时，麻烦总是随之而来。”

Keel stood up from his seat, quickly emptied his cup and mentally wrote down a reminder to summon Commander Ikari later in the evening. He would have to demand some very hard inquiries as to why Gendo was trying to implicate the Evas in a very hazardous, unauthorized experiment.  
基尔站起身来，迅速喝完杯子里的东西，并在心里记下晚上要召见碇司令。他必须严厉质问源堂为何试图将 EVA 卷入一项极其危险且未经授权的实验中。

"Depending on how well you will answer my questions," he muttered, "If you are wrong at the end, it may be the last time I dole out my forgiveness for all of your transgressions."  
“这取决于你回答我问题的程度，”他喃喃自语，“如果你最后答错了，这可能是我最后一次宽恕你所有的过错。”

As Shinji was heading towards the the Infirmary, many thoughts were swirling in his head, mostly memories of Rei. He also remembered the last time she was here.  
当真嗣走向医务室时，许多思绪在他脑海中盘旋，大多是关于绫波的记忆。他也记得她上次在这里的情景。

_I saved her once,_ he thought, _but she saved me on that day, yet she forgot what happened to herself. After all the trouble she got today, I don't know what to say this time._  
我曾经救过她一次，他想，但在那天她救了我，而她却忘记了关于自己的一切。经历了今天这些麻烦事后，我不知道这次该说什么。

Shinji frowned a bit, as he turned to the left corridor. He remembered that shabby-looking room that looked almost like Rei's home, the hospital bed surrounded by medical equipment and cabinets.  
真嗣微微皱眉，转向左边的走廊。他记得那个破旧的房间，几乎像是丽家的样子，医院病床被医疗器械和橱柜环绕。

_Or perhaps she doesn't know what to say either. I don't know. I'm not really sure because she's a clone; she's someone else… that's what makes me feel hard about her. She called herself the Third.  
或许她也不知道该说什么。我不确定。我不太确定，因为她是一个克隆人；她是另一个人……这让我对她感到难以释怀。她称自己为第三适格者。_

Shinji stopped walking, as understanding dawned upon him. He bowed down his head, doubting. His mind's eyes blinked from his mother's face to Rei's and back, but trying not to recall the gory mess in the tanks.  
真嗣停下脚步，恍然大悟。他低下头，心生疑虑。他的脑海中从母亲的脸庞切换到丽的，再切换回去，但努力不去回忆那些水槽中的血腥场面。

_On second thought, she is Ayanami, even if she's not sure about herself. Why do I have to worry so much about whether she came from that Dummy Plug Plant place or why she's part of Father's scheme? Or why do I have to be afraid of her? Why?  
转念一想，她是绫波，即便她对自己也不甚确定。我为何要如此担忧她是否来自那个 Dummy Plug 工厂，或是她为何成为父亲的棋子？又为何要害怕她？为什么？_

He saw in his mind's eye of Rei wringing a cleaning rag, water dripping down to the bucket, and then more memories of being together with her.  
他脑海中浮现出绫波拧着抹布，水滴落入桶中的画面，接着是更多与她共度的记忆。

_I can't… I have to face Ayanami. I'm responsible for her, for what she once used to be, for even trying to do everything for her.  
我不能……我必须面对绫波。我对她负有责任，对她曾经的模样，甚至为她尝试做一切。_

Shinji glanced up, deciding that he can't simply run away from this. Clone or not, he still owed her for everything; he affected her life and vice-versa.  
真嗣抬头瞥了一眼，决定他不能就这样逃避这一切。无论是否是克隆体，他仍然欠她一切；他影响了她的生活，反之亦然。

---

Rei felt a headache, head bowing down, and her palms against the forehead. She mumbled, "Nagisa… can I rest because I am not feeling right?"  
绫感到一阵头痛，低下头，手掌贴在额头上。她喃喃自语，"渚…我可以休息一下吗，因为我觉得不太对劲？"

Still seated besides her, Kaworu nodded and said, "Sure, you really need to. You do look nauseous."  
仍然坐在她旁边，薰点了点头说，"当然，你确实需要休息。你看起来确实很不舒服。"

The First Children sighed and closed her eyes as she lay down. _I could not handle all of what my mind has right now… It is very heavy for me. But I needed to know what went wrong._  
初代孩子们叹了口气，闭上眼睛躺下。我无法承受此刻脑海中的全部……对我来说，这太过沉重。但我需要知道哪里出了问题。

"Yes," Rei whispered. "Tell me what happened to me."  
“是的，”丽低声说，“告诉我，我发生了什么。”

Kaworu took a breath and began describing the whole story of what happened down there, including the rejection sequence and the chaos that followed.  
薰深吸一口气，开始描述在那下面发生的一切，包括拒绝序列和随之而来的混乱。

"Unit One does not want me," Rei said, her eyes still closed. "Do you think I am… worthless?"  
“初号机不需要我，”绫波说，她的眼睛依然闭着。“你觉得我……没有价值吗？”

Kaworu shook his head. "N… No," he disagreed, "you still have a lot to live for, I believe. You've managed to survive a great deal, though. 'Worthless' sounds too harsh, but I think this would be the last time you'll be riding an Evangelion.  
"渚薰摇了摇头。“不……不是的，”他反驳道，“我相信你还有很多活下去的理由。你已经挺过了很多，不过。‘没有价值’这个词太重了，但我想这将是最后一次你驾驶 EVA 了。”

"I tell you… Sometimes we have to look beyond all that; we have to look life outside of this environment, as we can't simply depend on one thing or desire. We have to add more dimensions to our lives. Then we could see some new possibilities, and also see our true worth. We cannot escape this world, but we can think of many ways to make this world more bearable to live. That's why humanity continues to exist as they socialize and interact, for better or for worse, as this world continues spinning on its axis."  
"我告诉你…有时候我们必须超越这一切；我们必须看看这个环境之外的生活，我们不能仅仅依赖一件事或一个愿望。我们必须为我们的生活增添更多的维度。这样我们就能看到一些新的可能性，也能看到我们真正的价值。我们无法逃离这个世界，但我们可以想出许多方法让这个世界更宜居。这就是人类之所以继续存在的原因，无论好坏，他们通过社交和互动，随着世界继续在其轴上旋转。"

There was a moment of silence between the Children, as Rei pondered Kaworu's words.  
孩子们之间有片刻的沉默，丽在思考薰的话。

"Can I ask you something instead?" he asked, breaking the reverie.  
“我能问你一个问题吗？”他打破了沉思。

"Yes."

"Do you still have a heart for Shinji?"  
"你对真嗣还有心吗？"

Rei took a bit of hesitation to think about it, and then recalled from memory some of the times she and Shinji were together; his smiles, tears, words of gratitude, and even his worst fears. Kaworu was here, willing to listen to all of what she wanted to say, probably the first time since the end of Unit-00 she was able to speak with some confidence.  
丽犹豫了一下，然后从记忆中回想起她和真嗣在一起的时光；他的笑容、泪水、感激的话语，甚至他最深的恐惧。渚薰在这里，愿意倾听她想说的一切，这可能是自零号机事件结束以来，她第一次能够自信地说话。

"He talks of everything about what he feels," she said. "More especially whenever he talked about his purpose of being here, and about his father. He is not sure of himself or about the Commander, for he is afraid; he feels he wants to run away. Perhaps I am the only one who could listen to him, because he could not open himself to everyone else.  
“他谈论着他的一切感受，”她说。“尤其是当他谈到他在这里的目的，以及他的父亲时。他对自己或对司令官都不确定，因为他害怕；他感到他想逃跑。也许我是唯一能听他倾诉的人，因为他无法向其他人敞开心扉。”

"Ikari affected me ever since we first met. Whenever I am hurt, I am alone, or when he is also hurt or alone, he comes to me. He formed me into the person he wanted to see in me, as I became close to him. He even wanted to see me smile because I am not always an emotional person and I am not able to react properly.  
“自从我们第一次见面以来，碇就一直在影响我。每当我受伤、孤独，或者他也受伤或孤独时，他都会来找我。他塑造了我，让我成为他想在我身上看到的那个人，随着我与他越来越亲近。他甚至希望看到我微笑，因为我不是一个总是情绪化的人，我无法恰当地反应。”

"But when Unit Zero was destroyed, he became afraid of me. I do not know but it has something to do about me losing my memories on that day. That time I am even unsure of myself, I cry for reasons I could not know until now."  
"但当零号机被摧毁时，他开始害怕我。我不清楚原因，但似乎与我那天失去记忆有关。那时我甚至对自己都感到不确定，我哭泣，却直到现在也不明白原因。"

Rei opened her eyes and focused at Kaworu. She was again crying.  
绫波睁开眼睛，凝视着渚薰。她再次流泪了。

"Ikari is the reason for my tears, for my heart longed for his presence," she admitted. "My heart wanted him because I am lonely."  
"碇是我的泪水之源，我的心渴望他的存在，"她坦白道。"我的心想要他，因为我感到孤独。"

For a quiet moment Kaworu watched Rei weep, knowing that she has finally told the cause for her sorrow.  
在一段静谧的时光里，渚薰注视着绫波流泪，他知道她终于倾诉了悲伤的缘由。

"But today… you're no longer alone," Kaworu answered almost quietly, breaking the silence. "To be honest, you're full of pain and longing, as your eyes said back at the pool. You asked for help, and I fulfilled that promise. That's why I'm here now."  
“但今天……你不再孤单了，”渚薰几乎轻声回答，打破了沉默。“老实说，你充满了痛苦和渴望，正如你在泳池边眼神所透露的那样。你寻求帮助，我履行了那个承诺。这就是我现在在这里的原因。”

Kaworu paused to get a box of tissues at the bedside table and gave it to Rei, who then daubed her cheeks and eyes with a handful of tissues.  
渚薰停顿了一下，从床头柜上拿了一盒纸巾递给绫波，她随即用几张纸巾轻拭脸颊和眼睛。

The Fifth Children smiled softly. "Looks like it's your lucky day," he mused.  
第五适格者温柔地笑了。“看来今天是你的幸运日，”他若有所思地说。

Rei set aside the tissue box. "Why?" she asked.  
绫波丽放下了纸巾盒。“为什么？”她问。

"I've never heard you talk much until today."  
"我以前从未听你多说过话，直到今天。"

"Yes," Rei answered. "It is you that makes me want to speak, just as you have told me to open my heart."  
"是的，"丽回答道。"是你让我想说话，就像你告诉我要敞开心扉一样。"

"You have to… You needed a release, and as it seems that you are now able to remember, you have it. It's called catharsis."  
"你必须……你需要一个释放，而既然你现在能够记起来，你已经得到了。这叫做宣泄。"

"C… Catharsis?" Rei repeated the word.  
“C……净化？”绫波重复了这个词。

Kaworu nodded. "That's right."  
渚薰点头。"没错。"

Rei felt relieved. More than anything, as if all the weight on her shoulders was lifted away. She then remembered what Shinji once told her when she couldn't know what to feel: _"I think… you should smile."_  
绫波零感到宽慰。仿佛肩上的重担一下子被卸下了。她随即想起了真嗣曾经在她不知该如何感受时对她说的话："我想…你应该微笑。"

"Nagisa… there is one thing I would like to say again," Rei said.  
“渚…有件事我想再说一次，”绫波说。

"What is it?" "是什么？"

Rei made a soft smile, also the first time since the destruction of Unit-00, now able to convey her emotions visibly. Her eyes found peace, yet there was a slight trace of blush on the cheeks. _I want to live_, she told herself, _and I want to continue these relations._  
丽露出了一个温柔的微笑，这也是自零号机被毁以来的第一次，她现在能够明显地表达自己的情感了。她的眼神中找到了平静，但脸颊上仍带着一丝淡淡的红晕。她告诉自己，我想活下去，我想继续这些关系。

"I… I thank you," she answered, "For saving me."  
“我……我感谢你，”她回答道，“因为你救了我。”

At a smaller workstation in the Data Analysis Room, Natsumi Odani was on the keyboard, having entered her ID card to securely access classified data. Fuyutsuki and Misato were watching behind her seat, listening to every word.  
在数据分析室的一个较小的工位上，音波奈津美正在键盘上操作，她插入了自己的 ID 卡以安全访问机密数据。冬月和美里站在她的座位后面，聆听着每一个字。

"Okay," Natsumi said as she entered query keywords for the search engine. "I'm getting some of the Functional MRI/PET scans on the First Children, then and now."  
“好的，” 夏美边说边输入搜索引擎的查询关键词，“我来找一些关于第一代孩子们的 fMRI/PET 扫描图，包括现在的。”

She pressed Enter, and then the workstation computer quickly found several of Rei's F-MRI/PET files, all cross-sectional scans. Natsumi loaded the first and the older among this group, displaying it onscreen.  
她按下回车键，工作站电脑迅速找到了几个绫波的 fMRI/PET 文件，都是横断面扫描。夏美加载了这组中最早的一个，将其显示在屏幕上。

"Here's the first one," she began. "This dates back after the attack on the Geofront, the one she tried to kill the Angel with an N2 but failed, and as per standard procedure for injured pilots after ER Doctor Akagi ran a brain scan on her. Now, if you can see it here, despite sustaining battle wounds, Ayanami's brain functionality remained normal. The amount of brain activity is indicated by the size and color of the overlays."  
"这是第一个样本，"她开始说道。"这来自对 Geofront 的攻击之后，她试图用 N2 导弹杀死使徒但失败了，按照受伤驾驶员的标准程序，赤木律子医生对她进行了脑部扫描。现在，如果你能在这里看到，尽管遭受了战斗伤害，绫波的脑功能仍然保持正常。脑活动的程度由覆盖层的大小和颜色表示。"

Fuyutsuki and Misato peered closely. On this image of Rei's brain, a scanned axial cross-section slice, colored overlay areas indicated signal changes in brain activity; red and yellow represented increased changes; blue and green showed reduced changes.  
冬月和美里凑近细看。在这张绫波大脑的扫描轴向横断面切片图像上，彩色覆盖区域表示脑活动的信号变化；红色和黄色代表增加的变化；蓝色和绿色则显示减少的变化。

"Then this is her brain after Unit Zero was destroyed," Natsumi remarked, loading a second image. On this image, the color overlay blobs located at the hippocampus were smaller, meaning little or no activity.  
"然后这是零号机被摧毁后她的脑部，"夏美说道，加载了第二张图像。在这张图像上，位于海马体的彩色覆盖斑块较小，意味着几乎没有活动。

"Does that mean that if these blobs here on this hippocampus are small," Fuyutsuki noted, "there's a problem with her memory? Am I correct?"  
"这意味着如果海马体上的这些斑点很小，" 冬月指出，"她的记忆力就有问题吗？我说得对吗？"

"Here, sir," Natsumi said, "it means that she has some trouble remembering, classified as retrograde amnesia. She may be able to remember some events or persons, but due to trauma she could not recall more recent events."  
"在这里，先生，" 夏美解释道，"这意味着她记忆有些困难，属于逆行性遗忘。她可能能记住一些事件或人物，但由于创伤，她无法回忆起更近期的经历。"

Misato nodded. "Ayanami wasn't able to remember about saving Shinji," she mentioned. _As if her mind was a slate wiped clean._  
美里点头。"绫波无法记起救真嗣的事情，"她提到。仿佛她的记忆被一块擦干净的石板。

"Ah, that's one example," Natsumi answered, before she selected a third image file and loaded it. "This is today's scan I did on her couple of hours ago," she remarked, pointing out the new changes shown on the image. The color blobs on the hippocampus area were large and orange-red, indicating greater amount of brain activity.  
"“啊，这是一个例子，”夏美回答道，随后她选择了一个新的图像文件并加载。“这是今天几个小时前我给她做的扫描，”她指着图像上显示的新变化说道。海马体区域的彩色斑块又大又橙红，表明大脑活动更为频繁。”

To Misato, all she could do was to scratch her head, but Fuyutsuki looked astonished.  
对美里来说，她只能挠挠头，但冬月看起来十分惊讶。

"Sir," Natsumi said, tapping the blob onscreen. "As this image tries to prove, what Unit One did to Ayanami's hippocampus area today, is that this Eva has forcefully inserted a truckload of information we don't have any idea about. Right now, lying on bed, she could be carrying, whatever it is, anything and everything in her head."  
“先生，”夏美敲击着屏幕上的斑块说道，“正如这张图像试图证明的，初号机今天对绫波的海马体区域所做的，是强行插入了一大堆我们一无所知的信息。现在，躺在床上，她可能正承载着，无论是什么，任何一切在她脑海中。”

Kaworu watched as the resident nurse went through the motions of checking Rei, taking a pulse with a stethoscope, measuring body temperature, fiddling with the flow valve on the IV line, and gave her a packet of painkiller tablets, which the First Children swallowed along with a glass of water while the nurse jotted her findings on a clipboard.  
渚薰看着值班护士按部就班地检查绫波，用听诊器测脉搏，量体温，摆弄着输液管的流量阀，还给了她一包止痛药片，第一适格者就着一杯水吞下了药片，护士则在剪贴板上记录着她的发现。

"Well," the nurse said to Kaworu, her nameplate on the white uniform identifying her as Chigusa, "all in all, she's okay but according to Doctor Odani, Miss Ayanami could be released tomorrow morning after she finishes some diagnostic tests this evening."  
"嗯，" 护士对渚说，她白色制服上的名牌显示她的名字是千草，"总的来说，她没事，但根据小谷医生的说法，明日香小姐今晚完成一些诊断测试后，明天早上就可以出院了。"

Kaworu nodded. "Thank you," he answered as the nurse left the room. Once they were alone, he sat down onto a chair and said, "Hmmm… Do you need anything, just to pass the time? Maybe you want to read a book or two? There's a little library around here."  
渚薰点头道：“谢谢。”护士离开房间后，他独自坐到椅子上，问道：“嗯……你需要什么来打发时间吗？或许你想读一两本书？这里有个小图书馆。”

"I do not know," Rei replied. "What book do you have in mind?"  
"我不知道，" 绫波回答。"你想到什么书了？"

"Perhaps you could appreciate the writings of Natsume Souseki?" he suggested.  
“或许你会喜欢夏目漱石的作品？”他提议道。

Rei simply nodded in approval.  
丽只是点头表示同意。

"Okay," Kaworu said, rising from his chair, "just wait here and…" He saw the door open and at the doorway Shinji was standing, looking at Rei.  
“好的，”渚薰说着从椅子上站起来，“就在这里等一下……”他看到门开了，门口站着真嗣，正看着丽。

Kaworu smiled. "Oh, it's you."  
渚薰微笑道：“哦，是你啊。”

"I… I'm sorry," Shinji said, walking into the room. "It took me so long to come here because I was with Misato."  
"我… 对不起，" 真嗣走进房间说道，"我花了这么长时间才来这里，因为我之前和美里在一起。"

"Ikari…" Rei whispered. "碇…" 绫波低声说道。"

"Ah… Ayanami… are you okay?" he asked, almost stammering because of his inner double-take. He began to take notice of her red eyes, which looked different from the last time; they were no longer blank and expressionless just like after Unit-00's demise. Gone also was the cold look on her face, replaced with new serenity. _Is that really you?_ Shinji wondered.  
"啊… 绫波… 你还好吗？" 他几乎结巴地问道，因为内心的双重反应。他开始注意到她红色的眼睛，与上次不同；它们不再像零号机毁灭后那样空洞无神。她脸上的冷漠表情也消失了，取而代之的是一种新的宁静。真的是你吗？真嗣心中疑惑。"

Rei, on the other hand, was trying to guess whether Shinji would be able to accept what she was today, and whether he would recognize once more her old self. Everything she knew about him and between them came through her mind as though she was leafing page after page of a photo album.  
另一方面，丽正在试图猜测真嗣是否能接受她现在的样子，以及他是否会再次认出她过去的自己。她所知道关于他以及他们之间的一切，如同翻阅一本相册的页面般在脑海中闪现。

With great and sudden clarity, Rei saw the first time they met in dangerous circumstances, she in his arms as the klaxons blared around them and above their heads, Eva Unit-01 managed to shield them together from falling debris with her arm. Rei was still in bandages, painfully trying to keep herself alive despite being asked to do the impossible, while Shinji mumbled not to run away.  
突然间，丽清晰地回忆起他们第一次在危险情况下相遇的情景，她在他怀中，警报声在他们周围和头顶轰鸣，初号机用她的手臂保护他们免受坠落碎片的伤害。丽当时还缠着绷带，痛苦地试图维持生命，尽管被要求去做不可能的事，而真嗣则喃喃自语着不要逃跑。

"Yes," Rei answered. "There is, however, regret that I was not able to answer your one concern previously."  
“是的，”丽回答道，“然而，遗憾的是我之前未能回应你的一个关切。”

"What is it?" "是什么？"

"I am sorry for my forgetfulness," she said softly. "I confess that I have saved you from the Angel."  
"我为我的遗忘道歉，" 她轻声说道。"我承认我曾救你脱离使徒。"

Shinji was left agape for a second or two. Kaworu knew it better to let them talk freely.  
真嗣目瞪口呆了一两秒。薰知道最好让他们自由交谈。

"You mean… You can remember _now_?" he asked, puzzled.  
"你是说…你现在能记起来了？" 他困惑地问道。

Rei nodded. "Yes."

"I… I don't know what else to say," Shinji said, trying to find the right words.  
“我……我不知道还能说什么。” 真嗣说道，努力寻找合适的言辞。

"Ikari, what matters most for me is you are now here," Rei said, bowing her head slightly. "Forgive me for causing you much distress."  
"真嗣，对我来说最重要的是你现在在这里，" 绫波说，微微低头。"请原谅我给你带来了这么多困扰。"

Shinji felt as if the world has gone off its axis, wondering what really happened to Rei and prompted her to talk like this. But he needed proof, so he asked her one question.  
真嗣感觉世界仿佛失去了平衡，想知道绫波究竟经历了什么，让她这样说话。但他需要证据，于是问了她一个问题。

"Ayanami," Shinji said, "Do you remember the day I delivered your new ID card?"  
"绫波，" 真嗣说，"你还记得我给你送新身份证的那天吗？"

There was a short pause between the two Children, the gears in Rei's mind spinning quickly to bring back the moment as if it happened yesterday.  
两个孩子之间短暂地停顿了一下，Rei 脑海中的齿轮飞速转动，将那一刻带回，仿佛就发生在昨天。

"Yes," she answered, now able to find the right words to describe that scene. "I was finished taking a bath when I found you waiting. You were holding a pair of glasses that once belonged to your father, and as a remembrance I kept it on the cabinet. I thought you were a thief, trying to steal them as you were wearing it. I tried to seize the glasses back from your hands, but we slipped to the floor. Unfortunately, I was only wearing a towel, and I have neglected to lock the door, therefore I did not notice you entering my room while I was bathing."  
“是的，”她回答道，现在终于能找到合适的词句来描述那个场景。“我洗完澡出来时，发现你在等我。你拿着一副曾经属于你父亲的眼镜，作为纪念，我把它放在柜子里。我以为你是小偷，想偷走它们，因为你正戴着它。我试图从你手中夺回眼镜，但我们滑倒在地。不幸的是，我只裹着一条毛巾，而且忘了锁门，所以我在洗澡时没注意到你进入我的房间。”

Then silence at this tableau. Rei was waiting for Shinji to react, but already it was happening. Kaworu now noticed that Shinji was clearly beet-red in the face, but even he was also overcome: straight-out, Rei admitted a very intimate part of her life, without blinking an eye, without guilt or malice, without embellishing or cutting out the details.  
然后是这一幕的沉默。绫波在等待真嗣的反应，但事情已经发生了。渚薰现在注意到真嗣的脸明显涨得通红，但就连他也被打动了：绫波直截了当地承认了她生活中非常私密的一部分，没有眨眼，没有愧疚或恶意，没有修饰或省略细节。

This was Rei's proof of life.  
这是绫波证明自己存在的方式。

"Shinji," Kaworu spoke, trying to snap him out of his daze. "I think Ayanami's right, because it's on your face… She's telling the truth."  
"真嗣，" 渚薰开口说道，试图让他从恍惚中回过神来。"我觉得绫波说得对，因为你的表情已经说明了一切……她在说实话。"

The Third Children slowly walked up to Rei, eyes locked to hers, still looked astonished, and then with both arms hugged her. Only then Shinji began to sob, as it was clear that the Rei Ayanami he liked best was now returned to him.  
第三适格者缓缓走向绫波，目光始终锁定在她身上，依旧显得震惊，然后双臂环抱住她。直到这时，真嗣才开始啜泣，因为很明显，他最喜欢的那个绫波丽已经回到了他身边。

### Chapter 13 Confessions

At the Data Analysis Room, the ringing phone interrupted one of the researchers working on a routine report. He picked up the reciever and suddenly froze, realizing the voice belonged to Commander Ikari, telling him a request and then the phone went dead. He glanced around and saw Fuyutsuki, in conversation with Natsumi Odani and Misato Katsuragi over Ayanami's condition. Meanwhile, Makoto Hyuga was busy talking on another phone, probably discussion related to the compatibility test fiasco.  
在数据分析室内，响起的电话打断了一位研究员正在编写的例行报告。他拿起听筒，突然僵住了，意识到这是碇司令的声音，向他提出请求后电话就断了。他环顾四周，看到副司令冬月与碇唯和葛城美里讨论着绫波的情况。与此同时，加持良治正忙着在另一部电话上交谈，可能是在讨论适格者测试的混乱。

The researcher stood up from his seat and walked towards the Sub-Commander.  
研究员从座位上站起身，走向副指挥官。

"Sir," the researcher said. "It's very important."  
"先生，"研究人员说，"这非常重要。"

"Yes?" Fuyutsuki replied.  
"什么事？" 冬月回答道。"

"The Commander wishes to talk to you in personally at his office."  
“指挥官希望在办公室亲自与你谈话。”

"I'll be there," Fuyutsuki said and turned his attention to both women. "May I excuse myself?"  
“我会去的，”冬月说道，随后将注意力转向两位女性，“我可以先告退吗？”

Natsumi and Misato nodded. "We'll take it from here, sir," Misato answered.  
夏美和美里点了点头。"我们会处理好的，长官，" 美里回答道。

As Fuyutsuki left the room, Misato remarked, "Looks like Commander Ikari's trying to pick up the pieces."  
冬月离开房间后，美里评论道："看来碇司令正在努力收拾残局。"

"I'm afraid he has no choice except it's his responsibility," Natsumi replied frankly. "We're just doing what he says, good or bad."  
"恐怕他别无选择，这是他的责任，"夏美坦率地回答。"我们只是照他说的做，无论对错。"

"And that's a problem," Misato said, "which makes you wonder where we're heading soon."  
"这就是问题所在，"美里说，"这让你不禁思考我们即将走向何方。"

Natsumi shook her head, as they watched Makoto put down the phone on its cradle and turned to Misato. "One of the chiefs down at the Test Facility said the crew crew did an inspection on that Entry Plug and the Bakelite system," he reported. "The Bakelite valves were found to have their power connectors removed a few minutes apparently after a routine inspection."  
夏美摇了摇头，他们看着诚将电话放回底座并转向美里。"测试设施的一位主管说，工作人员对那个插入栓和巴克兰系统进行了检查，"他报告道。"发现巴克兰阀门的电源连接器在例行检查后几分钟内被拆除了。"

"No doubt it's sabotage to me," Misato said. "What about her Entry Plug?"  
"毫无疑问，这是针对我的破坏行为，"美里说。"她的插入栓怎么样了？"

"It's fine. They found nothing except for exterior damage."  
"没事。他们只发现了外部损伤。"

Misato sighed. "I see," she agreed, before facing Natsumi. "Can we leave for a while? Just for some fresh air?" she suggested, signalling that Misato needed to talk to Makoto outside, in private. Makoto nodded in agreement.  
美里叹了口气。"我明白了，"她同意道，然后转向夏美。"我们能出去一会儿吗？只是呼吸点新鲜空气？"她提议道，示意美里需要和真琴在外面私下谈谈。真琴点头同意。

"It's okay," Natsumi replied, sitting down onto her workstation and began typing in her access codes. "I'll have a lot of work to do right now, then later check on the girls downstairs."  
"没事的，" 夏美回答道，坐在工作站前开始输入她的访问码。"我现在有很多工作要做，稍后再去楼下看看女孩们。"

---

Standing outside the room, as he watched Shinji and Rei talk intimately, Kaworu focused on one memory fragment from Rei that intrigued him:  
站在房间外，看着真嗣和丽亲密交谈，薰专注于丽记忆中的一个片段，这引起了他的兴趣：

In his mind's eye, there was a dark chamber, probably underground, and making up as the wall of this chamber was a massive, circular tank made of Plexiglas; and in the middle of this chamber was a Plexiglas cylinder with a tangle of wires and what looked like a massive spinal column connected to the top.  
在他的脑海中，有一间昏暗的房间，很可能位于地下，这间房间的墙壁由一个巨大的圆形 Plexiglas 水箱构成；房间中央是一个 Plexiglas 圆柱体，上面缠绕着电线，看起来像是与顶部相连的巨大脊椎。

This was now different, as it was too close to the truth. He was seeing through Rei's eyes, as she was right inside the central tank, floating in the amber LCL. But then, as he focused closely at the circular tank, thinking they were specks of impurities and silt, turned out to be the remains of the destroyed Rei clones, innards and all.  
现在情况不同了，因为这一切太过接近真相。他正透过绫波的眼睛观察，她就在中央舱室内，漂浮在琥珀色的 LCL 中。然而，当他仔细凝视那个圆形舱体时，原本以为是杂质和泥沙的斑点，竟是那些被摧毁的绫波复制体的残骸，内脏俱全。

Kaworu was taken aback, mouth agape. This was one of Rei's terrible secrets, confirming his description of Commander Ikari as a cunning manipulator. Many questions now began to pepper his thoughts.  
渚薰目瞪口呆，这正是零的可怕秘密之一，证实了他对碇司令狡猾操纵者的描述。许多问题开始在他的脑海中涌现。

_This is Ayanami? Who or what killed these copies of her, and why and for what purpose?  
这就是绫波吗？是谁或什么东西杀死了这些她的复制体，又是出于何种目的？_

He now remembered a place like this, for the purposes of his master, because like Rei Ayanami, he was born to serve a specific purpose.  
他现在记起了一个类似的地方，为了他的主人，因为就像绫波零一样，他生来就是为了服务于特定的目的。

_Kaworu opened his eyes, and he found himself in a Plexiglas tank full of LCL, wires snaking behind his back while bubbles rose from the bottom. He also felt that there were some electrodes stuck onto his head.  
渚薰睁开眼睛，发现自己身处一个充满 LCL 的亚克力箱中，电线蜿蜒在他背后，气泡从底部升起。他还感觉到头上贴着一些电极。_

_Kaworu heard voices, and he slowly turned his head to find where the voices came from.  
渚薰听到了声音，他缓缓转过头去寻找声音的来源。_

_Dazed and floating in the hazy orange light, he saw two men talking to each other. One was a bespectacled man in a lab coat, while the other was an older, obese man with a visor covering his eyes. Kaworu focused on their conversation and listened.  
在朦胧的橙色灯光中恍惚漂浮，他看到两个男人在交谈。一个是戴着眼镜、身穿白大褂的男子，另一个是年长、肥胖的男人，戴着遮住眼睛的护目镜。Kaworu 集中注意力于他们的对话，仔细聆听。_

_"So, I am glad that you have finally done the impossible," the older man spoke.  
“那么，我很高兴你终于完成了不可能的任务，”年长的男人说道。_

_The lab coat man with tufts of gray hair adjusted his thick eyeglasses. "Yes, Herr Lorenz," he answered. "I'm very thankful for your help after all these years... and I'm pleased to be honored."  
那位灰白头发蓬松的实验室外套男子调整了一下厚厚的眼镜。“是的，洛伦兹先生，”他回答道，“这么多年后，我非常感激您的帮助……而且我很荣幸能得到这份荣誉。”_

_Keel smiled. "Ah... Doctor Steingarten, we should be seeing the fruits of your efforts soon," he replied.  
基尔笑了。“啊……斯坦加滕博士，我们很快就能看到您的努力成果了，”他回应道。_

_"Yes, of course sir," Steingarten plesantly agreed. "Duplicating the procedures established by Fuyutsuki, Ikari and Akagi were indeed difficult, with so much trial and error. But now that we have pefected him after many years, I should daresay that we can go on to the next step."  
“当然，先生，”斯坦加滕愉快地同意道，“复制由冬月、碇和赤木建立的程序确实困难重重，经历了无数次的尝试和错误。但现在经过多年的完善，我敢说我们可以进入下一步了。”_

_"The Dummy Plug System," Keel said, supplying the answer. "It is one of several elements we need in performing the ritual for the ascension."  
“虚拟插头系统，”基尔说，给出了答案。“这是我们进行升天仪式所需的几个要素之一。”_

_"What do you mean of ascension, sir?" Steingarten asked, before he realized what it also meant. "Heaven... Yes, that's what we're expecting anytime."  
“您说的升天是什么意思，先生？”斯坦加滕问道，随即意识到这还意味着什么。“天堂……是的，我们随时都在期待着。”_

_Lorenz nodded, as if the word Heaven made him smile inside.  
洛伦兹点头，仿佛“天堂”这个词让他内心微笑起来。_

_"Uh..." Steingarten mumbled. "Sir, if you could allow me to speak."  
"呃..." 斯坦加滕咕哝道。"先生，如果您能允许我发言。"_

_"Yes," Keel agreed. "You may suggest."  
“是的，”Keel 同意道，“你可以提议。”_

_"I wonder if the final steps would be flawless," the wiry scientist remarked.  
"我好奇最终步骤是否能完美无缺，"那位瘦削的科学家评论道。"_

_"It should be," Keel answered. "And as your superior, I expect it to be perfect. More perfect that what NERV does. Their own Dummy Plug System has flaws, incapable of synching with any of their Evas. Their pilots are imperfect, even with the First Children whom Ikari put his best hopes on, as well as the Second Children whom we found to be a suicidal wreck just like her mother."  
"当然应该如此，"基尔回答道，"作为你的上级，我期待它完美无缺。比 NERV 所做的还要完美。他们自己的模拟插入系统存在缺陷，无法与任何他们的 Eva 同步。他们的驾驶员也不完美，即使是碇唯寄予厚望的第一适格者，以及我们发现如同她母亲一样是个自杀狂的第二适格者。"_

_Steingarten nodded. 斯坦加滕点了点头。_

_"And indeed in many ways we have the upper hand in dealing with the fundamental problems they have," Keel continued. "As for Ikari himself, his willful defiance is an irritation. Any further signs of that, we will start dealing with him by putting this boy into Ikari's little organization."  
"事实上，在处理他们根本问题方面，我们确实在很多方面占据优势，"基尔继续说道，"至于碇唯本人，他任性的反抗令人不快。如果有任何进一步的迹象，我们将通过把这个男孩送入碇唯的小组织来开始对付他。"_

_"And then...?"_

_"I expect him to seek out the weaknesses in the Third Children and exploit them. I also want him to place NERV into complete disarray that we can see if their defenses can be neutralized and use it to our advantage."  
"我预计他会寻找第三适格者的弱点并加以利用。我还希望他能将 NERV 置于彻底混乱之中，以便我们观察他们的防御是否能被中和，并利用这一点为我们谋利。"_

_Steingarten blinked slightly. "Sir, what about... what if there is a possibility of this boy failing his mission?"  
施坦因加滕微微眨眼。“先生，如果……如果这个男孩有可能任务失败呢？”_

_Keel grumbled, as he closed his fingers to form a fist. "If that happens, if he sacrifices himself," he answered, "We will use more effective measures to ensure our ascension."  
基尔咕哝着，握紧手指成拳。“如果那样，如果他牺牲了自己，”他回答，“我们将采取更有效的措施确保我们的崛起。”_

_"How that will be accomplished?"  
“那将如何实现？”_

_"If he dies as expected in the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls," Keel answered, "Then we shall initiate Operation Endgame."  
"如果他在《秘密死海古卷》中预言的那样死去，"基尔回答，"那么我们将启动‘终局行动’。"_

_Steingarten suddenly carried a slightly nervous look on his face. Apparently he knew anything about Operation Endgame.  
施坦加滕脸上突然露出一丝紧张的神情。显然，他对‘终局行动’一无所知。_

_"Doctor, is there any problem with that?"  
"博士，这样做有问题吗？"_

_"No," Steingarten disagreed, slightly unnerved.  
"不，" 斯坦加滕不同意，略感不安。"_

_"If you ever have any objections," Keel said, "There are many ways at our disposal to ensure your unemployment, some of them unpleasant. You also know that many will replace you on short notice, just like your Japanese counterpart, the late Naoko Akagi."  
"如果你有任何异议，" 基尔说，"我们有多种手段确保你失业，其中一些不太愉快。你也知道，很多人会迅速取代你，就像你的日本同行，已故的赤城奈央子那样。"_

_Steingarten kept himself still, daring not to make another move.  
斯坦加滕保持静止，不敢再有任何动作。_

_Keel turned around and gazed at the multitude of unconscious Kaworu Nagisas surrounding him, all of them willing to be sent forth. He faced Steingarten again.  
基尔转过身，凝视着周围众多失去意识的渚薰，他们全都愿意被派遣出去。他再次面对斯坦加滕。_

_"Doctor," Keel mentioned. "You will not mention about our conversation and assume that this has never happened between us. Do anything, but make it perfect," he emphasized, pointing out the first Plexiglas cylinder marked "101-17".  
“医生，”基尔说道，“你不要提及我们的对话，就当我们之间从未发生过这件事。做任何事，但要做得完美，”他强调道，指向第一个标有“101-17”的聚碳酸酯圆筒。_

_As the old Chairman turned to face Kaworu's container, the young man kept still, pretending not to listen.  
当老主席转身面对碇的容器时，年轻人保持静止，假装没有在听。_

_Steingarten nodded. "Yes sir," he agreed. "As you wish, we shall accomplish this for the Complementation of Man."  
斯泰因加特点了点头。"是的，先生，"他同意道。"如您所愿，我们将为人类的补完计划完成这一任务。"_

Kaworu shook his head. _In many ways, you're just like me, Ayanami,_ he sadly reflected.  
渚摇了摇头。在很多方面，你和我真的很像，绫波，他悲伤地想。

---

At the same time Kaworu was waiting and thinking outside at the hallway, Shinji was apologizing to Rei for some of his misgivings. He felt downcast as he did, but he knew that at one point before, Rei was his confessor when they were alone.  
与此同时，在外面的走廊上等待和思考的渚，真嗣正在为他的某些疑虑向绫波道歉。他这样做时感到沮丧，但他知道在某一刻之前，绫波曾是他独自一人的倾诉对象。

"Forgive me for what I told myself about you," Shinji said.  
"请原谅我对自己所说的关于你的话，"真嗣说。"

"Why?" Rei wondered. “为什么？”绫波疑惑道。

The young man shook his head. "For I saw the truth about you," he answered. "There were many of you. Copies just like you."  
年轻人摇了摇头。“因为我看到了关于你的真相，”他回答道，“你们有很多，就像你一样的复制品。”

Rei was now trying to find the right words to explain, but she couldn't utter a word.  
绫波现在正试图找到合适的词来解释，但她一个字也说不出来。

"Doctor Akagi said that they used you for the Dummy Plug," Shinji added, a bitter tinge in his speech, trying not to remember the gory aftermath. "But she was angry and destroyed your copies because she thinks you're responsible for her suffering. However, I don't think it's your fault."  
“赤木博士说他们用你来做模拟插入栓，”真嗣补充道，语气中带着一丝苦涩，尽量不去回忆那血腥的后果。“但她很生气，毁掉了你的复制品，因为她认为你是她痛苦的罪魁祸首。然而，我认为这不是你的错。”

Rei remembered that back at the Dummy Plug Plant after she came back from the Infirmary, as she was floating in the central tank she saw bits and pieces of herself.  
丽记得，在她从医务室回来后，当她漂浮在中央罐中时，她看到了自己零星的片段。

"I was born for a purpose," Rei answered. "The Commander wanted to see to that, and he told me that I have a duty to fulfill his wishes. He also said that I was important for his goal, and thus I have copies of myself for the Dummy Plug."  
“我生来就有目的，”丽回答道，“司令希望确保这一点，他告诉我我有责任实现他的愿望。他还说，我对他实现目标很重要，因此我为 Dummy Plug 制作了自己的副本。”

Shinji frowned. "What goal?" he asked.  
真嗣皱起眉头。“什么目标？”他问道。

Rei looked away. "He never told me about it. Only I have to do what he wanted, even if it means I have to risk myself because I have replacements then."  
丽转过头去。“他从未向我提起过。只是我必须完成他的意愿，即便这意味着我得冒着生命危险，因为我有替代品。”

The young man closed his eyes as if trying to relieve himself of the pain. Here was someone who was made, if not born, for a specific purpose for what end that he didn't know, and yet he was afraid of asking. Here was also someone who could not speak her own mind, or have the right to object or oppose, but simply to follow someone else's dictates.  
年轻人闭上眼睛，仿佛试图从痛苦中解脱出来。这里有一个人，无论他是被制造还是天生，都是为了一个特定的目的，尽管他不知道这个目的的终点是什么，但他害怕询问。这里还有一个人，她不能表达自己的想法，没有反对或反对的权利，只能遵循他人的指示。

Until now.

"It's all because of my father," Shinji said, as he remembered that mind-wracking experience while he was in a disintegrated form in the Entry Plug as Unit One nearly absorbed him; he was bombarded with endless questions about his purpose, existence, desires, fears, pain and pleasure. He wanted escape, but there was no place to run away from, and thus he had no other choice except to accept the expectations of others or the twists of fate.  
“这都是因为我父亲，”真嗣说道，他回忆起在插入栓中以分解形态差点被初号机吸收时的那段痛苦经历；他被无尽的问题轰炸，关于他的目的、存在、欲望、恐惧、痛苦和快乐。他想逃避，但没有地方可逃，因此他别无选择，只能接受他人的期望或命运的摆布。

Shinji lowered his head. "I wish all of this didn't happen," he thought aloud. "Not just for me or you, but everyone else around us. I wished a different life; I wanted to be someone else; I wanted to be normal."  
真嗣低下头。“我希望这一切都没有发生，”他自言自语道，“不仅仅是为了我或者你，还有我们周围的每一个人。我曾希望过另一种生活；我想成为另一个人；我想成为一个普通人。”

He turned his attention to Rei, who was silent. "Neither of us have choices," he said. "I should've said this but I can complain, I can yell or throw things, but my father doesn't listen. Nothing could try to change him, nothing."  
他转向沉默的绫波，说道：“我们都没有选择。”他说，“我本该说出来，但我可以抱怨，可以大喊大叫或者扔东西，但我父亲不听。没有什么能试图改变他，什么都没有。”

In Shinji's mind was his father's intimidating stare, stone-faced and those eyes behind glasses, expressing a single-minded determination. Under his withering gaze there could be no dissent, no opinion, and no freedom. Everyone will have to do as he ordered because he thinks what he does as a Commander is important.  
在真嗣的脑海中，是他父亲的威严凝视，面无表情，眼镜后的眼睛透露出坚定不移的决心。在他那令人窒息的目光下，不可能有异议，没有意见，也没有自由。每个人都必须按照他的命令行事，因为他认为作为指挥官所做的一切都是重要的。

"Exactly what does my father really want?" Shinji asked.  
“我父亲究竟想要什么？”真嗣问道。

"I could not answer that at all," Rei replied.  
“我完全无法回答这个问题，”绫波回答。

Shinji silently clenched his teeth, upset at the fact that if he ever summoned an enormous amount of courage to ask his father why, he would only meet a frustrating blank wall and that patent murmur. It was also obvious that despite she spent more time with his father, Rei didn't know much about the Commander's true personality.  
真嗣默默地咬紧牙关，对于自己若鼓起巨大勇气去问父亲为何如此，只会遭遇一堵令人沮丧的空白墙和那惯常的低语感到沮丧。同样显而易见的是，尽管绫波与父亲相处时间更多，但她对司令真实个性的了解并不多。

Then there was the job description. He remembered about the little NERV brief that Misato gave him to read not so long ago, which also described the roles of the Commander and other subordinates under his command.  
然后是工作描述。他记得不久前 Misato 给他的那份 NERV 简介，其中也描述了指挥官及其下属的角色和职责。

"Was it that he was made a Commander because he wanted me to save the world?" Shinji thought aloud, "Or that because somewhere he sees Mother in his work?" He sighed and shook his head.  
“是因为他想让我拯救世界才让我成为指挥官的吗？” 真嗣自言自语道，“还是因为在他的工作中看到了母亲的影子？” 他叹了口气，摇了摇头。

"Ayanami," Shinji said with a different conviction, "Until we get to know what he's truly up to, we'll never understand what we're actually here for, because it's killing me, unless you could at least try to get an answer for me because I know that you're much closer to him than I do."  
“绫波，” 真嗣带着不同的坚定说，“在我们了解他真正的意图之前，我们永远不会明白我们在这里的真正目的，因为这让我痛苦不堪，除非你能至少尝试为我找到答案，因为我知道你比我和他更亲近。”

"'Killing' you?" Rei queried, as sometimes metaphor and idioms defeated her.  
“'杀死'你？”丽问道，有时比喻和成语让她感到困惑。

"I mean, it's still driving me nuts," he clarified. "There are also still a lot of questions out here, even if Misato is still trying to find more answers. I bet that it's easier to solve a sudoku puzzle than this one."  
“我是说，这仍然让我抓狂，”他澄清道，“还有很多问题悬而未决，即使美里还在努力寻找更多答案。我敢打赌，解决一个数独谜题都比这个容易。”

Shinji sighed in despair. Other than solving mathematical solutions in school (and often with errors; he was not very good in math), his head never ached like this before, trying to crack the enigma that was his father. He decided to talk about something else, something he never broached to Rei before.  
真嗣绝望地叹了口气。除了在学校解决数学题（而且经常出错；他的数学并不好），他的脑袋从未像这样因试图破解父亲这个谜团而感到疼痛。他决定换个话题，一个他从未向绫波提起过的话题。

"I remember something when I was absorbed in the Entry Plug," Shinji said.  
"我在插入栓里全神贯注时，想起了一些事情，" 真嗣说道。

"What is it?" "是什么？"

Shinji made a wistful smile. "I saw Mother inside," he answered, "and I heard her talk to Father. Weird, I could also smell her. I think she said that if I wanted to live, anywhere can be heaven, and perhaps if I make it through, I have a chance at happiness. But right now this isn't happiness… except maybe with friends. They're happiness; they keep me from going crazy, and if I get hurt they also become worried for me, just like what Kensuke, Touji and Hikari said yesterday."  
真嗣露出了怀念的微笑。"我看到了母亲，" 他回答，"还听到了她和父亲的对话。奇怪的是，我还能闻到她的气味。我想她说，如果我想活下去，任何地方都可以是天堂，也许我挺过去后，就有机会获得幸福。但现在的我并不感到幸福……除了和朋友们在一起的时候。他们是我的幸福；他们让我不至于发疯，而且如果我受伤了，他们也会为我担心，就像昨天健介、阿薰和光所说的那样。"

"Are my memories my happiness?" Rei asked.  
"我的记忆就是我的幸福吗？" 绫波问道。

"It can be," Shinji replied, "if they were good memories. Haven't you experienced being truly happy when we're all together? Like back when we went out eating with Asuka and Misato? Or when Misato got promoted? Or when I saved you once?"  
"确实可以，" 真嗣回答，"如果那些是美好的回忆。我们在一起时不也曾真正感到快乐吗？就像和明日香、美里一起出去吃饭时那样？或是美里晋升的时候？还有我救了你那次？"

To Rei the idea of smiling or laughing was still alien to her, as she was bred to be completely indifferent to the world outside, and since her enrollment at school then she was always alone and unsociable. All it was drilled into her mind was total obedience, but from the time she met Shinji he changed her gradually.  
对于绫波来说，微笑或大笑的概念对她仍然很陌生，因为她被培育成对外界完全无动于衷，自从她入学以来，她总是独自一人，不善交际。她的脑海中灌输的只有绝对服从，但从她遇见真嗣的那一刻起，他逐渐改变了她。

Perhaps that was what happiness was all about, a change within, a chance to try at least lighten up. Or is it in the company of others that one can be happy?  
或许这就是幸福的真谛，内心的转变，至少有机会尝试放松。又或者，是在他人的陪伴中才能感受到快乐？

Yes, just like what Shinji said, interaction with people kept him from being sad.  
是的，就像真嗣说的那样，与人交往让他不再悲伤。

"Is it when I am not lonely, when I am with others that I can be happy?" Rei queried, as it seems that in the process of talking to Shinji, she was beginning to entertain possibilities for herself.  
“是不是当我不再孤单，与他人在一起时，我才能感到快乐？”绫波问道，似乎在与真嗣的交谈中，她开始为自己设想可能性。

"That's right," Shinji answered. "Kensuke said it all how important it can be to have someone to talk to, whether I feel bad or good. Just like what we're doing today."  
“没错，”真嗣回答，“健介说过，无论我感到难过还是开心，有人可以交谈是多么重要。就像我们今天这样。”

Then he remembered something else from the Entry Plug experience: he heard his mother talk to his father again, deciding what name he wanted for the firstborn; if his mother gave birth to a boy, he would be Shinji; or if it's a girl, she would be named Rei.  
然后他想起了在插入栓体验中的另一件事：他听到母亲再次与父亲交谈，决定为第一个孩子取什么名字；如果母亲生的是男孩，他将叫真嗣；如果是女孩，她将被命名为丽。

A shiver went up to his spine. If what he heard in the Entry Plug was correct, then this girl present before him is possibly his _twin sister_.  
一阵寒意直窜他的脊梁。如果他在插入栓里听到的没错，那么眼前这个女孩很可能是他的双胞胎妹妹。

Rei noticed the odd expression on Shinji's face. "What is wrong with you?" she inquired.  
丽注意到了真嗣脸上奇怪的表情。“你怎么了？”她询问道。

Shinji shook his head. "No, nothing," he answered sheepishly. Deep inside, though, he felt better being with her this time, hoping that nothing should ever take that cherished moment like this away from him.  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不，没什么，”他有些尴尬地回答。然而，内心深处，他这次与她在一起感觉更好，希望这样的珍贵时刻永远不会被任何事情夺走。

While Shinji and Rei were still deep into their conversation, Kaworu took his time to approach Asuka's room and looked through the windows. The Second Children remained completely drugged, wired, and almost motionless on her bed. The broken expression was also marked on her face, as she had surrendered all of her personal will to chemicals.  
当真嗣和丽还在深入交谈时，薰则慢慢走向明日香的房间，透过窗户往里看。第二适格者依旧被药物控制，全身僵硬，几乎一动不动地躺在床上。她脸上带着破碎的表情，似乎已经完全屈服于化学药物，放弃了个人意志。

Asuka laid there, begging to be helped in some way to get away from her misery even in that seemingly lifeless state. Perhaps tonight he would take advantage of his service to Rei by sneaking into Asuka's room. It was a risky move, but his urge to intervene was greater.  
明日香躺在那里，即使在看似毫无生气的状态下，也渴望得到某种帮助以摆脱痛苦。也许今晚他会利用为绫波服务的机会，悄悄潜入明日香的房间。这虽然是个冒险的举动，但他干预的冲动更为强烈。

He thought of his secret gift, trying to know its potential and its limits. True, SEELE trained him to make the most of his powers, such as generating and manipulating his AT-Field into any form he wished, or levitate with his will, but even now he was still learning. There was much that he never knew about himself, waiting to be unearthed.  
他思索着自己的秘密礼物，试图了解其潜能与极限。确实，SEELE 训练他最大限度地利用自己的能力，比如随心所欲地生成和操控 AT 力场，或是凭借意志悬浮，但即便如此，他仍在不断学习。关于自己，还有许多未知等待着被发掘。

Kaworu closed his eyes. _I wish I could know you better, but it's time for me to look into you. You can't live like this._  
渚薰闭上了眼睛。我希望能更了解你，但现在是时候深入探寻你了。你不能这样活下去。

"You were right," Gendo Ikari said sourly to Kozo Fuyutsuki. "I should have thought more carefully before doing this."  
“你说得对，”碇源堂语气苦涩地对冬月耕造说，“我本该在做这件事前更深思熟虑。”

Both men were in his office, alone and behind closed doors. Sitting on his chair and arms on the desk in the standard pose, Gendo also wore a scowl on his face, clearly bothered by the failure of his attempted experiment.  
两人都在他的办公室里，独处且门紧闭。坐在椅子上，双臂搁在桌面上，标准的姿势，加持脸上带着一抹不悦，显然对他的实验失败感到困扰。

"Why do you have to restart the Dummy Plug program?" Fuyutsuki asked. "It could've raised a lot of Committee eyebrows." Floating on the older man's mind was George Santayana's oft-quoted warning on the failure of understanding history, the terrible consequence of repeating a historical mistake. "I'm pretty sure they would know about it," he added.  
“你为什么要重启 Dummy Plug 程序？”冬月问道，“这可能会引起委员会的诸多关注。”乔治·桑塔亚那那句常被引用的关于未能理解历史的警告，以及重复历史错误的可怕后果，萦绕在这位年长者的心头。“我敢肯定他们会知道的，”他补充道。

"I thought today would be the perfect opportunity," he answered. "Apart from trying to get a good chance on a compatibility test, I was also hoping to record the Fifth Children's data, synthesize with the First Children's pattern and then incorporate into the revised Plug."  
“我认为今天是个绝佳的机会，”他回答道，“除了试图获得一个兼容性测试的好机会外，我还希望记录第五适格者的数据，与第一适格者的模式合成，然后融入修订版的 Plug 中。”

Fuyutsuki looked afar at the bucolic scenery out in the Geofront. "But I think it's too late, and as I have said previously, the Dummy Plugs we have built carried too many defects."  
冬月遥望着地表前方的田园风光。“但我认为为时已晚，正如我先前所说，我们制造的模拟插入栓存在太多缺陷。”

"That's enough," Gendo answered tersely. "From now on, no more of that nonsense, we're wasting too much time and money on those useless things."  
“够了，”碇源堂简短地回答。“从现在开始，不要再提那些胡言乱语，我们在这些无用的东西上浪费了太多时间和金钱。”

The Dummy Plug project was now offficially dead. For a while both men pondered before Fuyutsuki broke the silence, asking, "Care to ask why you remained standing as Unit One tried to kill you, even as there was clear and present danger to your life?"  
模拟插入栓项目现在正式宣告终止。两人沉默了一会儿，最终冬月打破了寂静，问道：“想知道为什么你在初号机试图杀死你时还能站立，尽管你的生命显然处于危险之中吗？”

"I remember recovering Rei from the Entry Plug," Gendo answered after a long pause. "You know that I got my hands burned while opening the escape hatch, and I broke my old glasses."  
"我记得从插入栓里救出丽的时候，" 碇源堂在长久的沉默后回答，"你知道我在打开逃生舱门时手被烫伤了，还弄坏了我的旧眼镜。"

"I know that," Fuyutsuki said.  
"我知道，" 冬月说。"

"Personal sentimentality, something I seem to miss in these days, or that I have forgotten completely."  
"个人的情感，这些日子里我似乎遗失了，或者说已经彻底忘记了。"

"Thinking of her again?" Fuyutsuki asked, referring to Yui.  
"又在想她了？" 冬月问道，指的是唯。

"She's the only one who said to me that she actually liked me," Gendo said. "I wished I known her much better."  
"她是唯一一个对我说过她真的喜欢我的人，" 碇源堂说。"我真希望我能更了解她。"

Fuyutsuki then turned to confront Gendo. "Then perhaps you were too trusting. Back then, you were so absorbed in your work."  
冬月随后转向碇源堂。"那么或许你当时太过信任他人了。那时，你完全沉浸在工作之中。"

Gendo said nothing, but Fuyutsuki recalled that Ikari spent a week of alcoholic debauchery after Yui's failed contact experiment, and afterwards came out with the Instrumentality Project and proposed it to SEELE.  
源渡一言不发，但冬月回忆起在唯的接触实验失败后，碇曾沉溺于一周的酗酒之中，之后便提出了人类补完计划，并向 SEELE 提议。

"If I could remember correctly," Fuyutsuki continued, "Your wife risked herself just to do something she thinks is noble, so she made herself a test subject for that contact experiment. I can also remember that day now, and I can even remember her words. She is the reason why we're here today."  
“如果我没记错的话，”冬月继续说道，“你的妻子甘愿冒险，只为完成她认为崇高的事业，因此她自愿成为接触实验的试验品。我现在还能记得那一天，甚至记得她的话。正是她，让我们今天走到了这一步。”

Gendo shook his head. "It's her choice, because she wanted to follow the path of the Scrolls; everything can fall into place as forecasted, but anyone can participate as part of their destiny."  
源渡摇了摇头。“这是她的选择，因为她想追随《死海古卷》的道路；一切都可以按预言的那样发展，但任何人都可以参与其中，成为他们命运的一部分。”

"Speaking of prophecies," Fuyutsuki said. "Do you really believe that everything can happen in accordance to the Scrolls?"  
"说到预言，" 冬月说。"你真的相信一切都会按照卷轴上写的发生吗？"

"Even with setbacks, everything goes according to plan," Gendo answered. "That's why I put my faith in it."  
"即使有挫折，一切都会按计划进行，" 碇源堂回答。"这就是我信任它的原因。"

Fuyutsuki shook his head. "You may not like this, but it has come to my mind right now that _not_ everything can happen as planned."  
冬月摇了摇头。"你可能不喜欢听，但我现在想到的是，并非所有事情都能如计划般发生。"

Gendo frowned. "What do you mean? Most of what the Scrolls predict and later correctly confirm every incident we encountered."  
源渡皱起眉头。“你这是什么意思？《卷轴》所预言的大部分内容，后来都准确地证实了我们遇到的每一个事件。”

"Some variables could affect everything and create unpredictability," Fuyutsuki explained, "including things beyond our control or knowledge, and even things we did not conceive of as part of our planning. But just as a fluttering butterfly in Tokyo-2 could possibly cause a storm in Miami, there will be always these variables because everything we do and what occurs in our complicated world, are always interconnected with each other."  
“有些变量可能会影响一切，产生不可预测性，”冬月解释道，“包括那些我们无法控制或了解的事物，甚至是我们在规划时未曾设想过的因素。正如东京-2 的一只蝴蝶振翅可能引发迈阿密的风暴一样，总会有这些变量存在，因为我们所做的一切以及这个复杂世界中发生的每一件事，总是相互关联的。”

Gendo cut him short with a signature murmur, which Fuyutsuki took as an agreement.  
源渡用他标志性的低语打断了他，冬月将其视为同意。

"The Entanglement Theory, is it correct?" Gendo asked, recalling an ancient but unconventional theory that was discussed in _Nature_. Once part of teachings of Eastern religions, it was now being studied seriously in subatomic physics. "Now that it makes sense to us," he went on, "if we apply this theory into our current situation, I'm pretty sure that even the Committee, for all of its influence and money, can have its own set of problems, just as we do. They can be also be affected by variables outside their responsibility."  
"纠缠理论，是正确的吗？" 源堂问道，回忆起一个古老但非传统的理论，该理论曾在自然杂志上讨论过。它曾是东方宗教教义的一部分，如今在亚原子物理学中被认真研究。"既然这对我们来说有意义，" 他继续说道，"如果我们把这个理论应用到当前的局势中，我敢肯定，即使委员会拥有所有的影响力和金钱，也会有自己的一系列问题，就像我们一样。他们也可能受到职责范围之外的变数影响。"

Gendo was now thinking, as he caressed his beard.  
源堂此刻正抚摸着胡须，陷入沉思。

"So that means that we'll have to closely look for variables that either we or they could take advantage of," Gendo continued. "Now that you made me think again, that brings us to one variable that may soon be a bone of contention, especially now that we have little time left. Either this could turn the tables on the Committee, or against us."  
"这意味着我们必须密切关注那些我们或他们可能利用的变数，" 源堂继续说道。"既然你让我再次思考，这就引出了一个可能很快成为争议焦点的变数，尤其是现在我们时间所剩无几。这要么可能让委员会翻盘，要么对我们不利。"

Gendo's glasses glinted for a second in the light, as if his confidence was restored by a quick stroke of genius.  
碇源堂的眼镜在灯光下闪烁了一瞬，仿佛他的自信被一瞬间的灵感所恢复。

"And what is this variable?" Fuyutsuki asked, slightly perplexed.  
“那么，这个变量是什么？”冬月问道，略显困惑。

"Kaworu Nagisa."

---

Shinji recalled his previous dispute with Rei on the escalator, in which as a rebuke she struck him on the face.  
真嗣回想起之前在自动扶梯上与绫波的争执，她以一记耳光作为对他的斥责。

"Do you remember when you slapped me?" Shinji queried.  
"你还记得你打我那次吗？" 真嗣问道。

Rei looked at him, trying to remember the circumstances, and then she answered, "I was being defensive then because I thought you were insulting him by telling me that you could not trust his work."  
绫波看着他，努力回忆当时的情形，然后回答道："那时我是在自卫，因为我觉得你告诉我不能信任他的工作是在侮辱他。"

Shinji shook his head. "Do you still trust him? Me? No, I still don't," he added, "Especially for what he did to you today."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"你现在还信任他吗？信任我吗？不，我还是不信任，"他补充道，"尤其是他今天对你做的事。"

Rei said nothing, as she was trying to sort herself out. She remembered Kaworu's promise before they boarded the Evas, vowing to be at his side should anything go wrong; and before that, Kaworu vowed to help her deal with that amnesia, and the Commander's lesson on the value of trust:  
丽没有说话，她正在努力整理自己的思绪。她记得在登上 EVA 之前，薰曾承诺过，一旦发生任何问题，他都会在她身边；在那之前，薰还承诺帮助她处理失忆的问题，以及司令关于信任价值的教诲：

"_Trust is, I believe, is a very precious commodity that we must be aware of and must be given carefully."_  
“我相信，信任是一种非常珍贵的资源，我们必须意识到它的重要性，并且要谨慎给予。”

Rei bowed her head low and spoke, "Today I am beginning to doubt the Commander."  
丽深深地低下头，说道：“今天，我开始怀疑司令了。”

Shinji looked puzzled, completely struck by her decision, as he always knew she was loyal to his father. "Why?"  
真嗣看起来很困惑，完全被她的决定震惊了，因为他一直知道她对父亲是忠诚的。“为什么？”

"I am now unsure of your father's wisdom," she admitted. "I could no longer rely on his work, and I also fear the future, of what may come soon to me."  
“我现在不确定你父亲的智慧了，”她承认道，“我不能再依赖他的工作，我也害怕未来，害怕即将降临到我身上的事情。”

"But…"

Rei looked into Shinji's eyes. "Because of it and I want to live, I have now put my trust on Nagisa… and you."  
绫波凝视着真嗣的眼睛。“正因为如此，我想活下去，我现在把信任寄托在渚薰……和你身上。”

Outside the main NERV building, Misato was talking with Makoto Hyuga over some of the more sensitive concerns, especially the probable sabotage of the Bakelite system and the secrets the glasses-wearing lieutenant brought out for her. He explained what happened when he tried to use Bakelite on Unit-01 but the dispensers were fouled.  
在 NERV 总部大楼外，美里正与眼镜少尉真希波·真理·伊斯卡谈论一些敏感问题，特别是可能的 Bakelite 系统破坏和他为她带来的秘密。他解释了尝试在初号机上使用 Bakelite 时，分配器被堵塞的情况。

"This reminds me of what happened to that Jet Alone junk heap," Misato recalled. "Somehow there's somebody on the inside who's trying to screw things up."  
“这让我想起了那堆 Jet Alone 废铁的事，”美里回忆道，“似乎有内部人士在试图搞破坏。”

Jet Alone was a robot built by a local industrial consortium in a bid to supplant Evas in the role of fighting off Angels, but this mechanical monster went out of control during its field demonstration months ago, forcing Misato and Shinji to completely shut down its nuclear engine before it could blow up.  
Jet Alone 是由本地工业联合体建造的机器人，旨在取代 EVA 在对抗使徒中的角色，但几个月前在实地演示中，这个机械怪物失控了，迫使美里和真嗣在它引爆前彻底关闭了其核引擎。

"They're not ruling that out," Makoto answered, "So as the chief down there said, he's conducting an investigation by questioning the crew. Maybe then Section Two would latch in there with an inquiry, but, no surprises, I'll expect nothing just like when they tried looking for Miss Langley."  
"他们并未排除这种可能性，" 真琴回答道，"正如那里的负责人所说，他正在通过审问船员来进行调查。或许随后第二部门也会介入调查，但不出所料，我对他们能找到什么不抱希望，就像他们之前寻找兰利小姐时一样。"

"That's what I'm afraid about those guys," Misato remarked, shaking her head. "Okay, what else… Ah, yes, Unit One," she added, wishing to change the subject.  
"这就是我对那些家伙的担忧，" 美里摇头说道，"好吧，还有什么……啊，对了，初号机，" 她补充道，想要换个话题。

"I'm not surprised with its odd actions, either," Makoto replied. "We also know that Unit One had a history of being unpredictable, such as eating and using the S2 Engine from an Angel, absorbing Shinji in the Entry Plug, rejecting Ayanami and the original Dummy Plug, and so on."  
"对于它的异常行为，我也不感到意外，" 真琴回应道，"我们也知道初号机有过不可预测的历史，比如吃掉并使用使徒的 S2 引擎，吸收真嗣进入插入栓，排斥绫波和原版模拟插入栓等等。"

Misato recalled talking with Ritsuko on the physiology of Angels, as they were recovering the remains of one that Shinji took down several months ago. Ritsuko admitted that for all of her efforts, learning all about the Angels' functions and powers were beyond their comprehension, and so far they were scratching the surface. Like the Angels, the Evas were also very complicated to begin with, and even today the resident NERV scientists understood only a fraction of their potential. Only when the Evas unleash the impossible, they reveal a little more of their terrible secret.  
美里回想起与律子讨论天使生理学的情景，那时他们正在回收真嗣几个月前击落的一个天使的遗骸。律子承认，尽管她付出了所有努力，但对天使的功能和力量的了解仍超出了他们的理解范围，迄今为止他们只是触及了表面。就像天使一样，Eva 从一开始就非常复杂，甚至到了今天，NERV 的科学家们也只理解了它们潜力的一小部分。只有当 Eva 展现出不可能的能力时，它们才会透露出更多可怕的秘密。

Then an idea entered her mind; it was unthinkable but plausible. Maybe it could explain why Rei now suddenly had a different state of mind.  
然后一个想法进入了她的脑海；这虽然难以置信但却是合理的。也许这能解释为什么绫波现在突然有了不同的心境。

"Do you remember about that Angel that fused with Unit Zero? And then it also tried to join with Unit One?"  
“你还记得那个与零号机融合的天使吗？然后它还试图与初号机结合？”

"Well, yeah," Makoto answered. "The Angel even did enter Ayanami's brain, just as her psychogram data tells."  
“嗯，是的，”真琴回答道，“天使确实进入了绫波的大脑，正如她的心理图谱数据所显示的那样。”

"And then at the mission debrief Shinji said his hands were sprouting small heads of Ayanami, or so he claimed, while trying to stop it. He even mentioned about the Angel talking in his head. At any rate, however, I was never told exactly what happened to Unit Zero or that girl, as Ritsuko kept totally mum about it. But now, I'm not discounting the possibility that the Angel may have served as a psychic conduit between the Evas while it was trying to fuse with them."  
“然后在任务汇报时，真嗣说他手上长出了绫波的小头，或者说他声称是这样，当时他正试图阻止这种情况。他甚至还提到了天使在他的脑海中说话。无论如何，我从未被告知零号机或那个女孩的确切情况，因为律子对此完全保持沉默。但现在，我不排除天使在试图与 Eva 融合时可能充当了它们之间的心灵通道。”

Makoto frowned. "What do you mean?"  
真琴皱起眉头。“你是什么意思？”

"I'm talking about not just a physical or a psychological attack, but something else that could be the answer as to what happened to Ayanami today."  
"我说的不仅仅是物理或心理上的攻击，而是其他可能解释今天绫波发生了什么的答案。"

"Do you want us to look into that?" Makoto asked. "I wonder if we still have much time."  
"你想让我们调查一下吗？" 真嗣问道。"不知道我们还有多少时间。"

"I don't care. We'll need to review the post-combat data, and every second of it. Check every variable, run the numbers, and then we'll have our answers because the Sub-Commander said the Evas know everything."  
"我不在乎。我们需要审查战斗后的数据，每一秒都不能放过。检查每一个变量，运算这些数据，然后我们就能得到答案，因为副司令说过，Eva 什么都知道。"

She remembered the strange pictures and the secrets that Makoto gave to her a few days ago. "Anyway," Misato said, "in the last two nights I looked into the data you gave to me."  
她记得几天前真琴给她的那些奇怪图片和秘密。“总之，”美里说，“在过去的两个晚上，我研究了你给我的数据。”

Makoto adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses. "How did it go? Have you found something?"  
真琴调整了一下他的圆框眼镜。“情况如何？你发现什么了吗？”

"You're right on the mark," Misato replied. "Besides the odd pictures, there were many discrepancies with Nagisa's data. I've also talked to the Vice-Commander about this anomaly, and he said that he was just as suspicious as we are. That's why I'm waiting for a chance to get close and personal."  
“你正中要害，”美里回答道，“除了那些奇怪的图片，还有许多与渚的数据不符之处。我也和副指挥官谈过这个异常情况，他表示和我们一样怀疑。这就是为什么我在等待一个机会去深入调查。”

"It's going to be sooner than we think."  
"会比我们想象的要早。"

"However, curiosity can kill a cat," Misato warned. "Remember, what we're getting into is becoming deeper than we ever expected, so we'll have to be extra careful because now I think we have traitors in here."  
"然而，好奇心能害死猫，"美里警告道。"记住，我们即将涉足的领域比我们预想的要深得多，所以我们必须格外小心，因为现在我认为我们内部有叛徒。"

---

"Ikari, I should have told you this as well," Rei said. "It occurred on the last minute as I tried to stop the Angel."  
"碇，我本该早点告诉你的，" 丽说。"就在最后一刻，我试图阻止使徒的时候发生的。"

"About what?" Shinji asked.  
“关于什么？” 真嗣问道。

Rei took a deep breath and spoke, "I liked you."  
绫波深吸了一口气，说道：“我喜欢你。”

Shinji blinked. "Y… You do? But you said…"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“你……你知道？但是你说过……”

"I liked you because you are… kind," Rei admitted, cutting him off. "Because you did everything good to me, something that your father hardly does. That is why sometimes I worry about you, thinking about you, and I fill that emptiness in me by having you in my heart."  
“我喜欢你是因为你……善良，”丽坦白道，打断了他。“因为你对我做了所有美好的事情，这些你父亲几乎从未做过。所以有时候我会担心你，想着你，我通过把你放在心里来填补那份空虚。”

The First Children bowed her head and continued, "There's a void in me… It's always there, empty, and I feel like as if I was made of straw. I remember being afraid of it, I would fill it up by thinking about your father."  
第一适格者低下头继续说道，“我心中有一个空洞……它一直存在，空荡荡的，我感觉自己就像是用稻草做成的。我记得曾经害怕过它，我会通过想念你的父亲来填补它。”

Shinji was speechless. He couldn't believe what she was admitting now to him, especially that she was speaking from the bottom of her heart.  
真嗣无言以对。他无法相信她现在向他坦白的一切，尤其是她发自内心地说出这些话。

"But one day, before I knew what was happening… you were there inside."  
“但有一天，在我还没意识到发生了什么之前……你就已经在那里了。”

"Me?"

"Until you came, I could not understand myself except I existed because of the Commander. However, because I connected with you I changed, I became different and I have even felt the change in my heart."  
“在你出现之前，我只能理解自己是因为司令而存在。然而，因为与你相连，我改变了，变得不同，甚至感受到了内心的变化。”

Shinji felt his heart swell, seemingly glad that she was crediting him for what she became now.  
真嗣感到心中涌起一股暖流，似乎很高兴她将现在的自己归功于他。

"There is, however, what I fear… I fear loneliness." Rei's face now had an expression of personal regret.  
"然而，我害怕的是…我害怕孤独。" 丽现在脸上带着一种个人的悔恨表情。

"Why?" he asked doubtedly.  
“为什么？” 他怀疑地问道。

"The Angel challenged me to look into myself, and she was right that I was truly alone, I was hiding this fact from even you. Forgive me, but the Angel told me without speaking that my heart wanted you only for myself, to see only you."  
“天使让我正视自己，她是对的，我确实孤独，甚至对你也隐瞒了这一点。请原谅我，但天使虽未言明，却让我明白我的心只渴望你一人，只想见到你。”

Rei tried not to burst into tears again, but it was too late as the salty drops spattered her blanket.  
丽试图不再泪流满面，但为时已晚，咸涩的泪水已经溅湿了她的毯子。

"Do I look guilty to you, for me having that sorrow, hatred and distress in my heart?"  
"我看起来像是有罪吗，因为我心中有那份悲伤、仇恨和痛苦？"

Shinji shook his head. "N… No, you were never like that bad to me. You're really amazing, I swear."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"不……不，你从未那样对我不好。你真的很了不起，我发誓。"

"Please forgive me for having these thoughts, but I need you to know what I truly feel."  
"请原谅我有这些想法，但我需要你知道我真正的感受。"

"Don't," Shinji answered, trying to reassure her as he took the girl into his arms. "You don't have to blame yourself... Instead I thank you for telling this."  
"别这样，" 真嗣回答，试图安慰她，同时将女孩拥入怀中。"你不必自责... 相反，我感谢你告诉我这些。"

Rei rested her head upon Shinji's shoulder, knowing that he was one of the few persons she could actually lean on, but the Commander was not among them: he never did an act like this for her.  
绫波靠在真嗣的肩膀上，知道他是少数几个她可以真正依靠的人，但司令官不在此列：他从未为她做过这样的事。

Fuyutsuki was poised to leave, as it appeared that Gendo recovered better out of today's otherwise hard events after he thought about the possibilities of making better use of Kaworu's presence and talent, so the old man felt it was the best time for requests.  
冬月正准备离开，因为看起来源堂在今天的艰难事件后恢复得不错，他考虑到了更好地利用渚薰的存在和才能的可能性，所以这位老人觉得现在是提出请求的最佳时机。

"One word before I go," Fuyutsuki said, "Just a favor or two."  
“我走之前说一句，”冬月说道，“只是一个小忙。”

"Hmmmm…" Gendo murmured, as his arms and hands were still in the same pose even after a half-hour.  
“嗯……”源堂低声哼道，他的手臂和手仍然保持着半小时前的姿势。

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat. "Is it acceptable if we should just release Miss Langley and return her to Germany as a humanitarian gesture to her parents? You know, I don't think she should remain in that condition for too long."  
冬月清了清嗓子。“如果我们只是释放兰利小姐，并将她作为人道主义姿态送回德国给她的父母，这样是否可以接受？你知道，我不认为她应该长时间保持那种状态。”

Gendo frowned, but he was considering Fuyutsuki's request.  
碇皱了皱眉，但他正在考虑冬月的请求。

"That would be acceptable," Gendo decided. "Provided that she should not tell everyone and everything about our activities, but given her psychological state, I am sure that her words will not be given credence. To the world, she's broken."  
“那样是可以接受的，”碇决定道，“前提是她不能透露我们的一切活动，但考虑到她目前的心理状态，我相信她的话不会被当真。对世界而言，她已经崩溃了。”

"Another thing: what about Doctor Akagi? In the long term, what are you going to do with her now that she's in jail?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
“还有一件事：赤木律子博士呢？从长远来看，既然她现在被关在监狱里，你打算怎么处理她？”冬月问道。

The Commander snorted in contempt. "She'll remain here, as she's the only one who knows the MAGI inside and out, and any subordinates under her department may be allowed to ask her for guidance regarding its operation, but should she try once more to derail our plans, then I will have her permanently removed and imprisoned. Her crime will bring her only a discredited reputation more as a conspiracy theorist than a scientist, and no one will accept any of her allegations should she decides to go public."  
指挥官轻蔑地哼了一声。“她会留在这里，因为她是唯一一个对 MAGI 了如指掌的人，她部门的任何下属都可以向她请教关于其操作的问题，但如果她再次试图破坏我们的计划，那么我会让她永久消失并关押起来。她的罪行只会让她作为一个阴谋论者而非科学家的名声更加狼藉，如果她决定公开这些指控，没有人会接受她的任何说法。”

_Once again,_ Fuyutsuki told himself, _he has no regrets judging their fates._  
福音津木再次告诉自己，他对于评判他们的命运毫无悔意。

"Very well, then," Gendo continued, "Tonight I'll sign the release papers for the Second Children, and by tomorrow afternoon she should be gone from here. I am through with useless people."  
“很好，”碇继续说道，“今晚我将签署释放二号机的文件，到明天下午她应该就不在这里了。我不再需要无用之人。”

Fuyutsuki nodded, inwardly displeased with Gendo's use of the derisive word 'useless', but then he thought of the Committee, probably angry by now and demanding for an answer.  
冬月点了点头，内心对碇源堂使用贬义词'无用'感到不满，但随即他想到了委员会，可能现在已经愤怒并要求答复。

"Finally," Gendo spoke, as if he seemed to have read his mind, "Should the Committee know what I did today and they want to talk to me, you shouldn't worry as I will deal with them personally. I am not afraid of a little word-sparring."  
"终于，" 碇源堂说道，仿佛读懂了他的心思，"如果委员会知道我今天所做的事并想与我谈话，你不必担心，我会亲自处理。我并不害怕一点口舌之争。"

Shinji glanced at the wall clock above the bed, and told him it was past three in the afternoon; still much time to talk about. The First Children felt relieved that her personal self-burden was eased by his presence.  
真嗣瞥了一眼床头墙上的挂钟，告诉他已经是下午三点多了；还有很多时间可以聊聊。第一适格者感到欣慰，因为他的存在减轻了她个人的心理负担。

"Thought you might want to know," he began.  
"想着你可能想知道," 他开口道。

"Yes?" Rei asked. "是吗？" 绫波问道。

The young man sighed. "Dunno, but I noticed that lately you're really stuck with Kaworu."  
年轻人叹了口气。"不知道，但我注意到最近你和渚薰走得很近。"

"It was necessary that he was required to work with me."  
"这是必要的，他需要和我一起工作。"

"No… It's something different."  
"不……是另一回事。"

"What do you mean?"  
"你是什么意思？"

"After I told Kensuke that you and Kaworu look alike," Shinji disclosed, "he thinks both of you make a nice couple. Since the day Kaworu first came here, you couldn't avoid being with him… But I'm okay with you being with him, not against it; I'm really happy about it because I think you… You also need someone besides me to have good company."  
"我告诉了 Kensuke 你和 Kaworu 长得很像，"" 真嗣透露道，""他认为你们俩很般配。自从 Kaworu 第一次来这里，你就无法避免和他在一起……但我并不反对你和他在一起，我真的为此感到高兴，因为我觉得你……除了我之外，你也需要有人陪伴。"

Rei was speechless, but Shinji thought otherwise as he wondered if Rei was _falling_ for Kaworu after nearly three days from their first meeting; had things here were normal and all of them were in school, many of Shinji's classmates would've whispered rumors, guessing whether they were made for each other or whatever romantic notions entered their minds, generously fed by nightly local and Korean soap operas.  
丽无言以对，但真嗣却有不同的想法，他疑惑丽是否在初次见面后的近三天时间里对薰产生了感情；如果这里一切正常，他们都在学校的话，真嗣的许多同学恐怕早已窃窃私语，猜测他们是否天生一对，或是其他浪漫的念头，这些想法在每晚的本地和韩国肥皂剧中被慷慨地滋养着。

But Shinji didn't want to hurt Rei by asking too much about her relationship with the Fifth Children; he'll leave that for Rei to find out for herself, just as he was trying to find the meaning of his relationship between him and Asuka.  
但真嗣不想通过过多询问她与第五适格者的关系来伤害丽；他会让丽自己去发现这一切，正如他正在努力寻找自己与明日香之间关系的意义。

He wanted to get Asuka out of her misery, but he had none of the power to do so except he was hoping Misato was trying her best even if the odds were mostly against her. It didn't matter if Asuka could return as a pilot; he wanted to see her live, he wanted to settle things and perhaps hopefully they might finally come to terms with themselves.  
他想要将明日香从痛苦中解救出来，但他没有这样的力量，除了希望美里能尽其所能，尽管形势大多对她不利。明日香是否能重返驾驶员之位并不重要；他只想看到她活着，他想解决这些事情，也许最终他们能彼此和解。

Just as he was about to resume talking, Kaworu walked in.  
正当他准备继续说话时，渚薰走了进来。

"How's it going?" Kaworu asked.  
“最近怎么样？”渚薰问道。

Shinji smiled. "Everything's fine; it's just that we had so much to say as if we haven't seen each other in a long time."  
真嗣微笑道：“一切都好；只是我们有太多话要说，仿佛很久没见面似的。”

Rei was silent except she made a faint smile of satisfaction.  
绫波零没有说话，只是露出了一个淡淡的满意微笑。

"I guess that now both of you settled your differences," Kaworu remarked.  
“我想现在你们俩已经解决了分歧，”渚薰评论道。

Shinji nodded, and turned his attention to Rei.  
真嗣点点头，将注意力转向了绫波。

"Ayanami," he said. "Looks like I have to go because you need to rest."  
"绫波，"他说。"看来我得走了，因为你需要休息。"

"Yes, you are right," Rei answered.  
"是的，你说得对，" 丽回答道。

"Okay." Shinji stood up from his seat and faced Kaworu. "I'll owe you nothing for her, so today I'm putting my trust on you."  
"好吧。" 真嗣从座位上站起来，面对着渚薰。"我不会欠你什么，所以今天我把信任寄托在你身上。"

"Thanks," Kaworu replied happily, and he reached out his hand to shake Shinji's. "I never expected that we have a whole day full of surprises."  
"谢谢，" 薰开心地回答，并伸出手与真嗣握手。"我从未预料到我们会有一个充满惊喜的一天。"

"That's right," he agreed. "We'll never know what comes next. Again, thanks for saving Ayanami."  
"没错，" 他同意道。"我们永远不知道接下来会发生什么。再次感谢你救了绫波。"

Both bowed to each other, before Shinji walked away, smiling and waving his hand at Rei as he left the room. Once they were alone, Kaworu turned to Rei as he sat down on the bedside chair.  
两人互相鞠躬，随后真嗣微笑着向绫波挥手，离开了房间。当他们独处时，渚薰转向绫波，坐在床边的椅子上。

"I think he's happy to see you like that," Kaworu said. "He never doubted you this time," he added as he began to push a button on the bed's recliner control to lower it, then he gestured Rei to sit up a bit as he fixed her pillow, before she lay down again. Kaworu covered a blanket over her form.  
"我想他看到你这样很高兴，"渚薰说，"这次他从未怀疑过你，"他边说边开始按下床头躺椅控制器上的按钮将其放低，然后示意绫波坐起来一点，帮她调整枕头，待她再次躺下后，渚薰为她盖上了毯子。

"Thank you," Rei said as she closed her eyes.  
"谢谢你，"绫波闭上眼睛说道。

"You're always welcome," Kaworu whispered.  
"不用谢，"渚薰轻声回应。

Once she was completely asleep, Kaworu looked at Rei. She looked delicate, at peace with herself, a child and a woman at once. This prompted him to briefly and gently stroke her blue hair with his fingers.  
待她完全入睡后，渚薰凝视着绫波。她显得脆弱，内心平和，既像个孩子又带着女性的气质。这让他不由得用手指轻轻地抚摸她蓝色的头发，动作短暂而温柔。

Kaworu felt satisfied that everything was all right between her and Shinji, hoping this rekindled relationship could continue from now on. To be honest and yet he never broached this directly to Rei, Kaworu slowly came to like her despite the girl's character deficiencies, and the odd, unavoidable circumstances seemed to have made them gravitate to each other. Kaworu now also had this growing sentiment of responsibility that Rei owed him for, and that he sensed in her a desire to live.  
渚薰感到满意，绫波和真嗣之间的关系一切顺利，希望这段重燃的情感能从此延续下去。坦白说，尽管绫波的性格有所缺陷，加之那些难以回避的奇特境遇，渚薰渐渐对她产生了好感，而两人似乎也因此相互吸引。如今，渚薰还感受到一种日益增长的责任感，觉得绫波欠他一份情，同时他察觉到她内心渴望活下去的愿望。

As he left the room, Kaworu knew that should anything untowards happen to her, he will defend her at all costs.  
当他离开房间时，渚薰心里清楚，如果她遭遇任何不测，他定会不惜一切代价保护她。

In her office, Misato was hunched over her desk, reading every report from the Unit One-induced mayhem that was stacked and emailed to her. Usually folders and emails landed upon her desk after every incident involving the Evas, especially damage reports and repair estimates. She was often annoyed by this bureaucratic morass, but as the officer responsible for all Eva operations, she had to respond to each and every one of them.  
在她的办公室里，美里弓着身子伏在桌前，仔细阅读着由初号机引发的混乱所产生的每一份报告，这些报告堆满了桌面并通过电子邮件发送给她。通常情况下，每次涉及 EVA 的事件后，尤其是损害报告和维修估算，文件夹和邮件就会落在她的桌上。她常常对这种官僚主义的繁琐感到恼火，但作为负责所有 EVA 行动的官员，她必须对每一份文件做出回应。

Already halfway through the stack her eyes were becoming heavy, no thanks to the exhaustion mostly generated by today's crisis. Misato was feeling sleepy, and now she needed a shot of coffee to jumpstart her system. She grabbed her mug and went to the pantry room where the coffee maker was plugged in.  
文件已处理过半，她的眼皮愈发沉重，这多半归咎于今日危机带来的疲惫。美里感到困倦，现在急需一杯咖啡来唤醒自己。她拿起杯子，走向插着咖啡机的储物间。

As she filled the mug with the dark-brown java and added two cubes of sugar, Misato summed up all of the day's events.  
当她将深褐色的咖啡倒入杯中并加入两块方糖时，美里回顾了今天发生的所有事情。

_Looks like the Commander is getting desperate,_ she thought. _He suddenly gets this rash idea of kickstarting his dead project. Now that it's dead again, I wonder what's he's going to do next._  
看来指挥官真是走投无路了，她心想。他突然冒出重启那个已死项目的鲁莽念头。如今项目再次停滞，真不知道他接下来会怎么做。

Misato sighed, as she sampled her coffee. _Sure, we have the budget and apparently there's no end in sight for us down here, but signs are appearing all over, telling me that our time would be up soon._  
美里叹了口气，品尝着她的咖啡。当然，我们有预算，而且显然这里没有尽头，但我们即将结束的迹象到处都是，告诉我我们的时间不多了。

_How we would end up? What would happen?  
我们会如何结束？会发生什么？_

_Whatever the end would be, I intend that I want to survive once more in the same way I made it out of Antarctica.  
无论结局如何，我打算再次以我逃离南极的方式生存下来。_

Just as she was about to take a sip, Shinji appeared at the pantry's doorway.  
就在她准备喝一口的时候，真嗣出现在了食品储藏室的门口。

"Oh, there you are," Misato said, tabling her coffee mug.  
“哦，你在这儿啊，”美里说着，把咖啡杯放在了一边。

Shinji smiled a little. "Ayanami and I had a long talk," he answered. "She was okay. Don't know how it happened, but suddenly she could remember."  
真嗣微微一笑。“绫波和我进行了一次长谈，”他回答道，“她没事。不知道怎么发生的，但突然间她就能记起来了。”

"How did you found out?" she asked, blinking in near-disbelief.  
“你是怎么发现的？”她问道，几乎不敢相信地眨了眨眼。

"Well, I asked her if she remembered me bringing her new ID card, and she did… She said it exactly as if it happened yesterday."  
"嗯，我问她是否记得我给她带了新身份证，她确实记得……她说得就像那是昨天发生的事一样。"

Misato suddenly shivered. She then leaned closer to Shinji and whispered, "Fuyutsuki, Doctor Odani and I discussed this a few hours ago, as we found out Rei's different today because apparently Unit One affected her hippocampus. It's a part in the brain that's where your memories are."  
美里突然打了个寒颤。她随即靠近真嗣，低声说道：“副司令官冬月和医生大谷几小时前讨论过这个，因为我们发现今天零号机的行为不同，显然是因为初号机影响了她的海马体。那是大脑中储存记忆的部分。”

"Like psycho…" he stammered, trying to get the spelling right, "Is it like psychological contamination?" he asked.  
"像心理……" 他结结巴巴地试图拼对单词，"这是否像心理污染？" 他问道。

The older woman shook her head. "No, Shinji, this is completely, damn-crazy _different_. When we say psychological contamination, usually it means that the Eva affects your head by trying to mess up everything inside. Too much and you get brain damage, leave you as a vegetable, or even kill you."  
那位年长的女士摇了摇头。""不，真嗣，这完全是，该死的，完全不同。当我们说心理污染时，通常意味着 Eva 试图扰乱你内心的一切，从而影响你的心智。太过严重的话，会导致脑损伤，让你变成植物人，甚至可能致死。"

Misato now looked closer into Shinji's eyes. "However, if what you said about Rei remembering everything is for real, then it confirms what we suspected after checking her brain scans and test records. Anyway, I'll try to debrief Rei and Kaworu as soon as they're ready."  
美里现在更仔细地看着真嗣的眼睛。“不过，如果你所说的关于绫波记得一切的事情是真的，那么这证实了我们检查她的脑部扫描和测试记录后的怀疑。无论如何，我会尽快与绫波和薰进行简报，一旦他们准备好了。”

Shinji said nothing as she drank her coffee, but then Misato suddenly tabled the mug, gestured to him to come with her and led him out of the pantry. As she passed by her desk, she quickly picked up her purse and pressed the power button on her computer to shut itself down.  
真嗣一言不发地喝着咖啡，但随后美里突然放下杯子，示意他跟她走，并领着他离开了餐具室。经过她的办公桌时，她迅速拿起钱包，按下电脑的电源键将其关闭。

"What about those?" he asked, pointing at the junk on the desk. "Where we're going?"  
“那些东西怎么办？”他指着桌上的杂物问道，“我们要去哪儿？”

Misato shrugged. "Maybe I'll finish the rest of that crap tomorrow, so come on, you and I should get home and forget this for now. I had enough for this day," she answered.  
美里耸了耸肩。“也许我明天再处理剩下的那些垃圾，走吧，你和我应该回家，暂时忘掉这一切。今天我已经受够了。”她回答道。

Inside the elevator, Kaworu pressed the button for the Cafeteria's level, and the doors closed shut. As the elevator began to move up, he placed his palm over the heart, sensing a strange throbbing inside, before he touched his lips with his fingers.  
在电梯里，薰按下了通往食堂楼层的按钮，门随即关闭。随着电梯开始上升，他将手掌放在心脏位置，感受到一种奇怪的跳动，然后用手指轻触自己的嘴唇。

_I never felt something like this before,_ he contemplated. _I can't even tell what this unusual feeling is. What's going on with me?_ he asked himself.  
我以前从未有过这种感觉，他思索着。我甚至无法分辨这是怎样一种不寻常的感觉。我这是怎么了？他自问。

**Author's Note:** This chapter took so much for me to think about (amidst personal problems on my side), trying to guess what happens next and what they would say (and me trying not to allow those personal problems to interfere with the writing). The important thing is that I wanted some of their personal issues to be settled with, but in a gradual way, and then what's left is to deal with some of the other remaining characters, most especially with Asuka and the Command Bridge crew.  
作者留言：这篇{{101}}让我思考良多（尽管个人问题缠身），努力揣测接下来会发生什么，他们会说些什么（并试图不让这些个人问题干扰写作）。重要的是，我希望他们的一些个人问题能逐步得到解决，然后剩下的就是处理其他一些角色，尤其是明日香和指挥桥的成员们。

We're just getting started.  
我们才刚刚开始。

By the way, today's OP/ED songs for this chapter are Mutemath's "Spotlight", and Angela Aki's "This Love" respectively.  
顺便一提，今天的chapter开场/结尾曲分别是 Mutemath 的《聚光灯》和 Angela Aki 的《这份爱》。

### Chapter 14 Asuka Langley Soryu, I Presume

While Kaworu was away for dinner, Natsumi Odani attended to Rei and, to get a closer look at her brain, was putting the girl through the MRI scan for another time.  
当渚薰外出用餐时，音波夏美负责照顾丽，为了更仔细地观察她的脑部，再次让女孩接受了 MRI 扫描。

Lying down, as Rei slowly went under the scanner's head, at their workstation Natsumi and a technician looked at the display giving them the results of each scanner pass. She had the scanner adjusted for a finer pass and greater enhancement, with full emphasis on the brain's hippocampus portion. While Rei presently occupied most of her thoughts, the other remaining space was devoted to the written memo handed down from the Commander a while ago, requesting that starting tomorrow morning Asuka's IV-delivered sedatives and medications will be cut off in preparation for her discharge from NERV service.  
躺下后，随着丽缓缓进入扫描仪的头部下方，在工作站旁，夏美和一名技术人员正盯着显示屏，查看每次扫描的结果。她已将扫描仪调整为更精细的扫描和更高的增强效果，重点放在大脑的海马体部分。虽然丽目前占据了她的绝大部分思绪，但剩下的空间则被指挥官不久前下达的一份书面备忘录所占据，要求从明天早上开始停止给明日香通过静脉注射的镇静剂和药物，以准备她从 NERV 退役。

Glancing at one of the monitors showing the girl onscreen, Natsumi took a microphone on the workstation's counter and told Rei, "How are you doing in there?"  
夏美瞥了一眼显示屏幕上的女孩，拿起工作台上的麦克风，向丽问道：“感觉怎么样？”

Looking back at the camera, Rei quietly nodded.  
丽回头看向摄像头，静静地点了点头。

"Good. The diagnostics would be for a while," Natsumi reminded her. The other tests included a blood sample, the usual cardio-respiratory checks, and once those tests were finished, a little dinner for the girl. This she asked Rei about it. "What do you want for dinner?"  
"好。诊断需要一段时间，" 夏美提醒她。其他检查包括血液样本、常规的心血管检查，以及完成这些测试后，给女孩准备一顿小晚餐。她向丽询问了这件事。"晚餐你想吃什么？"

Rei blinked twice to recall what she most often ate, and then she recalled what she thought to be the best-tasting meal in her entire life. The scene at Shin-Miyanoshita came back to her as if it happened yesterday:  
丽眨了两次眼，回想她最常吃的食物，然后她想起了她认为一生中最好吃的饭菜。新宫野之下的场景再次浮现在她脑海中，仿佛昨天才发生：

_At the market section of Shin-Miyanoshita, just off the train station, they were at a noodle stand, festooned with large red Chinese lanterns. Already Misato and the Children were assailed by a rich mixture of aroma and flavors, as they sat down and began ordering their food.  
在新宫野之下的市场区，就在火车站旁边，他们站在一家挂着大红灯笼的面摊前。米萨托和孩子们已经坐下开始点餐，被丰富的香气和味道所包围。_

_Asuka pointed to Misato, and said, "Hey, I know what you've got in your wallet. Don't worry." She was grinning proudly as she pulled out a wad of extra 1000-yen bills. "This honor student says she wants to come with us for noodles," she added, referring to Rei.  
明日香指着美里，说道：“嘿，我知道你钱包里有什么，别担心。”她得意地笑着，掏出一叠额外的千元钞票。“这位优等生说她想跟我们一起去吃面条，”她补充道，指的是绫波。_

_Misato laughed. "Oh, no, looks like you're pretty serious about chipping in!" Already she had a bowl of spiced wonton noodles with a can of Yebisu on the side.  
美里笑了起来。“哦，不，看来你是认真的要分担了！”她面前已经摆了一碗香辣馄饨面，旁边还有一罐惠比寿啤酒。_

"_Sure, we've made through it cleanly," Asuka answered before she turned her attention to the cook. "I'd like you to gimme some shark's fin and a large order of baked pork"._  
“当然，我们干净利落地解决了，”明日香回答后转向厨师。“我要一份鱼翅和一大份烤猪肉。”

_The cook nodded, proud to have some eager new patrons with a paycheck to blow out, turned his notice to Rei.  
厨师点了点头，自豪地迎来了一批渴望尝试的新顾客，他们口袋里有钱可以挥霍，于是他将注意力转向了丽。_

"_Miss, what's your order?" he asked cheerfully._  
“小姐，您要点什么？”他愉快地问道。

"_I would like to have garlic noodles without Cha-Shu. No grilled pork," Rei answered._  
“我想要一份没有叉烧的蒜香面，不要烤猪肉，”丽回答道。

"_And I'd want some pork dumplings with mine," Shinji added._  
"我还要一些猪肉饺子。" 真嗣补充道。

"_All right, and for that foreign lady here, here's your shark's fin and pork," the cook said, handing Asuka a tray of her dinner, which was hefty with two filled big bowls._  
"好的，这位外国女士，这是您的鱼翅和猪肉，" 厨师说着，递给明日香一盘丰盛的晚餐，里面装满了两大碗。

"_Why, thank you," Asuka answered cheerfully._  
"哎呀，谢谢你，" 明日香愉快地回答。

_As they got their orders and were eating, Shinji gestured at Misato.  
在他们点完餐并开始用餐时，真嗣向美里示意。_

"_Yes?" the older woman paused._  
“怎么了？”年长的女性停顿了一下。

"_I'm pretty glad today, because my father praised me for piloting Eva and finishing the mission," Shinji answered cheerfully._  
“我今天很高兴，因为我父亲表扬了我驾驶 EVA 并完成了任务，”真嗣愉快地回答。

_Asuka faced Shinji and frowned. "And that's why you're a pilot?" she asked, not wanting to be put on second place. "That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!"  
明日香面对真嗣，皱起了眉头。“这就是你成为驾驶员的原因？”她问道，不想屈居第二。“这是我听过最蠢的事了！”_

_Shinji made a face. "This isn't your party, either."  
真嗣做出一副表情。“这也不是你的派对。”_

_Misato shook her head. "Ah, come on, guys, we don't have something like this once in a while."  
美里摇了摇头。“哎，别这样，我们可不是经常有这样的机会。”_

"Garlic-noodles," Rei answered, "But please do not add pork."  
"蒜香面," 丽回答道，"但请不要加猪肉。"

Natsumi smiled. "Got it," she said. "I'll make a call with the cook to do that one for you."  
夏美微笑着。"明白了，"她说，"我会打电话给厨师，让他为你特别准备一份。"

At the Cafeteria, Kaworu's dinner consisted of soybean sausages, rice and a salad with light dressing, and as he ate his meal in his mind he was replaying the events that occurred throughout the day.  
在食堂里，渚的晚餐包括了豆肠、米饭和一份轻酱汁的沙拉，他一边吃着，脑海中一边回放着今天发生的种种事情。

He thought about when he locked lips with Rei while resuscitating her. He could vividly remember the texture and the softness of her lips, amidst the overpowering smell of LCL. Once she opened her eyes, there was this strange new vitality in them, which he had never noticed before.  
他回想起在给丽进行人工呼吸时与她唇瓣相触的那一刻。尽管 LCL 的浓烈气味扑鼻而来，他仍能清晰地记得她唇间的触感和柔软。当她睁开双眼时，那里面闪烁着一种他从未见过的奇异新生命力。

Finally, there was this tenderness in his heart, a new sensation unlike any other, and he wondered if Chairman Lorenz or his tutors has ever taught him about human feelings.  
最终，他的心中涌起了一股温柔，一种前所未有的感觉，他不禁思索，洛伦兹主席或他的导师们是否曾向他传授过关于人类情感的知识。

_No,_ Kaworu decided. _I don't remember he said much else about the Lilin, but still I have to learn more as I think I may have understood them for only a fraction._  
不，渚薰决定。我不记得他关于人类还说过什么，但我仍需了解更多，因为我觉得自己对他们的理解仅是冰山一角。

The gray-haired young man now began to make plans to deal with Asuka.  
这位灰白头发的年轻人现在开始制定对付明日香的计划。

Later, back in bed, Rei contemplated about the only time she did slapped Shinji's face out of anger, when they were riding on the escalator. The resurrected memories made her felt what it was like to slap someone's face.  
后来，回到床上，绫波思考着唯一一次她因愤怒而扇了真嗣耳光的那一刻，当时他们正乘坐着自动扶梯。这些复活的记忆让她感受到了扇人耳光的感觉。

"_Then why you could not trust it? It is the work of your father!"_  
“那你为什么不能相信它？这是你父亲的作品！”

But out of that Rei recalled how Asuka slapped her face out of the Second Child's contempt. A hard slap made from all the hate and derision the other girl carried, not knowing that later her deceptive façade came down in a matter of days.  
但其中，丽记得明日香因第二适格者的轻蔑而扇了她一巴掌。那一记重重的耳光，充满了对方所怀有的所有仇恨与蔑视，却不知在短短几天后，她那虚伪的面具便土崩瓦解。

Absently Rei let her hand touch her cheek, trying to recall the pain she received from Asuka's open palm. She knew the anger-filled words from the half-German girl, deriding Shinji and all of his worth and of her warning.  
丽心不在焉地用手轻触脸颊，试图回忆起明日香手掌带来的痛楚。她清楚地记得那位德日混血女孩充满愤怒的话语，嘲讽真嗣以及他的一切价值，还有她的警告。

"_Shut up, you frigid bitch! You do anything you're ordered to. You'll waste yourself if Commander Ikari orders you to do so!"_  
“闭嘴，你这个冷冰冰的婊子！你只会唯命是从。如果司令碇源堂命令你，你就会自甘堕落！”

But Asuka never heeded her advice, whose near-fatal consequences could be sadly seen in a hospital bed, and it made Rei feel disappointed for her.  
但明日香从未听从她的建议，其近乎致命的后果在医院的病床上悲哀地显现，这让绫波感到失望。

_I am trying to point out your mistakes... But I am sad for you, Pilot Souryu. I wanted to help you... but you did not listen to me.  
我试图指出你的错误...但我为你感到难过，惣流飞行员。我想帮助你...但你没有听我的。_

Rei sighed softly. _Now if you could only wake up, open your heart and try to talk to me once more, because we are almost the same, whatever the differences between us._  
绫波轻轻叹了口气。现在，如果你能醒来，敞开心扉，再次尝试与我交谈，因为我们几乎是一样的，无论我们之间有何差异。

Now as she touched her lips with the tips of her fingers, Rei still wondered who Kaworu was beneath the kindly veneer he possessed.  
此刻，当她用指尖轻触双唇时，丽仍然在想，卡尔瓦在和善的外表下究竟是谁。

_For all of what you have said,_ Rei contemplated, addressing Kaworu, _I should have asked you about whom you are and why are you here for. You may be hiding something from me._  
尽管你说了这么多，丽沉思着，对卡尔瓦说，我本该问你你是谁，为何来此。你或许对我有所隐瞒。

The killer was still in his van, at the same parking lot off Hakone's Route 75, busy monitoring every tapped packet and port coming across his notebook computer, trying to pick up any loose and vital piece of intelligence, when he heard the cellphone go off again. He pressed the button on his earset and spoke, "Yeah?"  
杀手仍在他停在箱根 75 号公路旁停车场的货车里，忙着监控笔记本电脑上每一个被窃听的数据包和端口，试图捕捉任何松散而关键的情报，这时他听到手机再次响起。他按下耳机的按钮，说道：“喂？”

"I'm out here now," a man answered, voice scrambled but differently toned from the other man he talked to several hours ago. "Just finished with my shift," he continued, "but something's up from the top brass."  
"我现在在外面，" 一个男人回答道，声音虽然有些杂音，但与几个小时前通话的另一个人语调不同。"刚结束我的班次，" 他继续说，"但高层那边似乎有动静。"

The killer knew that this new caller was an expert mole on the same side he was, a deep-cover agent formerly of the American CIA, currently assigned to NERV's Reports and Requirements section for nearly three years. This section, which received reports from the field and then reprocessed into easy-to-read briefs for the higher-ups, was an excellent position for secretly pilfering the secret flow of information and playing merry hob with the agency's operations, intelligence-gathering activities and general policy-making.  
杀手知道这个新来电者是同一阵营的专家间谍，一名曾隶属于美国中央情报局的深度潜伏特工，目前被分配到 NERV 的需求与报告部门近三年。这个部门负责接收来自现场的报告，然后将其重新处理成易于阅读的简报供高层阅读，是一个绝佳的位置，可以秘密窃取机密信息流并对机构的行动、情报收集活动和一般政策制定进行干扰。

"What's going on?" "发生了什么事？"

"According to Mister Freeze," the mole reported, the well-suited codename referring to Commander Ikari and his cold personality, "tomorrow afternoon he's gonna fire the little primadonna back to where she belongs."  
"根据冷冻先生," 间谍报告道，这个穿着讲究的代号指的是碇司令和他的冷酷性格，"明天下午他打算把那个小公主送回她该去的地方。"

"She's mine. How did you know?" the killer asked. Then he remembered that previously this mole managed to screw up and delay the Second Section's search for the runaway Asuka Langley Soryu by feeding falsified information to the agents in the field. Serving as the killer's information source, the mole was also responsible for providing him the necessary intelligence on Kaji's final whereabouts before eliminating that agent. However, he wasn't aware of the fact that the triple-agent mole was ultimately the one responsible for sabotaging the Bakelite system hours ago.  
"她是我的。你怎么知道的？" 杀手问道。随后他记起之前这个间谍曾搞砸过，通过向现场特工提供虚假信息，拖延了第二分部对逃跑的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的搜寻。作为杀手的情报来源，间谍还负责在他消灭那位特工之前提供关于加持最后行踪的必要情报。然而，他并不知道那个三重间谍间谍实际上是几小时前破坏贝克莱特系统的幕后黑手。

"The usual paperwork, of course," the mole answered. "He asked for release papers and signed them, then sent out carbon copies for the department heads to read tomorrow. For the most important stuff, he still doesn't trust email and electronic forms, you know. By the way, right now Section Two's chief is in conference with his troops, planning to use armed escorts to keep an eye on her until she's out of here."  
"当然是常规文件，" 间谍回答道。"他要了释放文件并签了字，然后发送了副本给各部门负责人明天阅读。对于最重要的东西，他还是不信任电子邮件和电子表格，你知道的。顺便说一句，现在第二分部的部长正在和他的部队开会，计划使用武装护卫一直盯着她，直到她离开这里。"

The killer silently clenched his teeth, cursing inwardly. Now he'll have to change the mission parameters immediately and before that he needed to tell his employers first about the sudden shift in the situation. At any cost and as he always wanted to finish the job on a proper note, he can't let his quarry – half-dead or not – get away.  
杀手默默咬紧牙关，心中暗骂。现在他必须立即更改任务参数，在此之前，得先通知雇主关于局势的突然变化。无论如何，正如他一直希望的那样，要以恰当的方式完成任务，他不能让他的猎物——哪怕半死不活——逃脱。

At the balcony outside their apartment, and sated from dinner, Misato was lying on the chaise longues and staring at the night sky above her. On the table beside her, a cordless phone laid there, waiting just in case. In the living room the radio was on, tuned to a rock station and playing a song from Creed, but she could also hear Shinji taking care of the dishes in the sink, water splashing over the clanking plates.  
在他们公寓外的阳台上，饱餐一顿后，美里躺在躺椅上，凝视着头顶的夜空。她旁边的桌子上放着一部无绳电话，随时待命。客厅里的收音机开着，调到了一个摇滚电台，播放着 Creed 乐队的歌曲，但她也能听到真嗣在厨房洗碗，水花溅在叮当作响的盘子上。

Misato looked at one bright star in the sky, Vega, and wondered how far she made it in her entire life. She sighed, having seen her share of too much personal triumph and tragedy in a single year, but the reason that she didn't quit her job was her avowed promise to fight the Angels purportedly responsible for her father's death.  
美里望着天空中一颗明亮的星星——织女星，思索着自己一生中走了多远。她叹了口气，这一年里经历了太多个人的胜利与悲剧，但她没有辞职的原因是她发誓要与那些据说是导致她父亲死亡的天使战斗到底。

Oh, she told Shinji before about her reasons to be here. Though she hated her father for being so self-absorbed into his work, of neglecting both Misato and her mother, only after she survived Second Impact did she wondered if there was a reason to love or hate her father.  
哦，她之前就跟真嗣提过自己来这里的原因。尽管她恨父亲沉迷工作，忽视了她和母亲，但在经历了第二次冲击后，她才开始思考是否有什么理由去爱或恨她的父亲。

Joining NERV, she believed, was the only way for her to be free of his spell. However, Kaji always reminded Misato of her father's personality, which made her gravitate towards that man. How she tried to be someone else, to bury her old self, but Kaji broke open her scars and let them bleed.  
加入 NERV，她相信，是她摆脱父亲影响唯一的途径。然而，加持总是让美里想起她父亲的个性，这使她不由自主地被那个男人吸引。她努力想成为另一个人，埋葬过去的自己，但加持揭开了她的伤疤，让它们再次流血。

His death was a final blow to all that she would have wanted in life; afterwards there was little else she could go to. Perhaps it's time for her to move on, find someone else or endure the winter of her singleness.  
他的死是对她生活中所有渴望的最终打击；之后，她几乎找不到其他可以依靠的东西。也许现在是时候让她继续前进了，找到另一个人，或者忍受单身冬日的漫长。

It didn't matter for Misato if she could die as an old maid, as long as she must live her life to the fullest.  
对于美里来说，是否能以老处女的身份死去并不重要，只要她必须活得淋漓尽致。

Which brought her to another thing she must at least appreciate before her number is up.  
这让她想起了另一件在她生命终结前至少要感激的事情。

"Shinji," Misato called out. "You're finished in there?"  
“真嗣，”美里喊道，“你在里面完事了吗？”

"Yeah," the young man answered from the kitchen.  
"嗯，" 年轻人在厨房里回答道。

"Can you get _us_ some beer from the fridge?"  
"你能从冰箱里给我们拿些啤酒吗？"

"What? You're nuts, I can't drink," Shinji objected.  
"什么？你疯了吧，我不能喝酒，" 真嗣反对道。

Misato shook her head, realizing there was a standing prohibition against under-twenty drinking, but anyway there were no cops in this war zone of a neighborhood, or for that matter, no neighbors either in this apartment block; everyone else had packed and moved away, never to return. "Doesn't matter," she answered. "Screw the age limit, just grab the six-pack and come here."  
美里摇了摇头，意识到有规定禁止二十岁以下的人饮酒，但反正这个战区般的街区没有警察，甚至在这栋公寓楼里连邻居都没有；其他人都已经打包离开，再也不会回来。“没关系，”她回答道，“去他的年龄限制，拿上那六罐啤酒过来。”

Shinji arrived with the six-pack of Yebisu, and as the young man laid it down onto a table and Misato pried out one of the cans, yanking the tab away, she said, "Come on, open another for yourself, but don't be shy. Honestly, I'm not teaching you to be a drunkard like me, but I want you to learn an experience you might use someday when you're going to socialize with people, especially when they offer you a drink."  
真嗣带着六罐惠比寿啤酒到了，当年轻人把它放在桌上，美里撬开一罐，拉开拉环时，她说：“来，再给自己开一罐，别害羞。说实话，我不是教你像我一样酗酒，但我想让你学会一种将来社交时可能会用到的经验，尤其是当别人请你喝酒的时候。”

"O… Okay," Shinji answered as he sat down on a chair and pulled the tab of his own beer. All he knew was that beer was bitter-tasting, but considering their grim circumstances, he couldn't refuse her offer. He put the can close to his lips, smelled it as he was hesitant, before he told himself, _Never mind, I have to at least try,_ he took a sip.  
“好…好吧，”真嗣回答着坐到椅子上，拉开了自己那罐啤酒的拉环。他只知道啤酒味道苦涩，但考虑到他们严峻的处境，他无法拒绝她的提议。他把罐子凑近嘴唇，犹豫地闻了闻，然后告诉自己，没关系，至少得试试，于是他喝了一口。

"Unless you explain that you have a liver problem," Misato added, "it's impolite to refuse a gesture of goodwill."  
"除非你解释说你有肝病，" 美里补充道，"拒绝别人的好意是不礼貌的。"

Shinji grimaced at the taste of his first beer, before swallowing it hard. _Damn, it's so bitter._  
真嗣皱着眉头尝了一口他的第一杯啤酒，然后硬着头皮咽了下去。该死，真苦。

Misato shook her head. "That's what the first-timers do when they have their first drink," she advised. "After a few more, the bitterness doesn't matter as the true essence of the brew becomes apparent."  
美里摇了摇头。"第一次喝酒的人都是这样，" 她建议道，"再多喝几杯，苦味就不重要了，因为酒的真正精髓会显现出来。"

"Really?"

Misato nodded. "That's true. Just take it easy on every sip, don't go overboard or you might not be able to swallow more of your drink."  
美里点点头。"确实如此。每次小口慢慢喝，别喝太猛，不然你可能就喝不下更多了。"

Shinji took a deep breath and this time he drank a little more of his beer. In approval, Misato raised her can.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，这次他多喝了一点啤酒。美里见状，举起她的罐子表示赞许。

After a silent moment, Shinji was the first to ask, breaking the silence. "What made you share your beer with me?"  
沉默片刻后，真嗣率先开口，打破了宁静。"你为什么愿意和我分享啤酒？"

"You and I have will have a one-on-one discussion, so tonight I must make an apology to you," the older woman answered morosely, "for trying to get you in bed. I'm really sorry, that was the only thing I thought would be good." Misato then sighed.  
"你我需要单独谈谈，所以今晚我必须向你道歉，"年长的女人忧郁地回答，"为了试图和你上床。我真的很抱歉，那是我唯一想到的好办法。"美里随后叹了口气。

Shinji said nothing, still holding his can.  
真嗣一言不发，依旧握着他的罐子。

"No, it's been real stupid of me doing that. I just don't know what else I could do to keep you from being sad. I wanted to forget, try at least making my brain go blank, wishing not to think who killed him. I felt fucking helpless as I wasn't able to save Kaji's life. How I wish I could. Lust was then the only other acceptable escape, but you proved me wrong, snapped me back to my senses…"  
"不，我那样做真是太蠢了。我只是不知道还能做些什么来让你不那么难过。我想忘记，至少试着让我的大脑一片空白，不去想是谁杀了他。我感到无比无助，因为我没能救下加持的生命。我多么希望能做到。欲望曾是唯一可接受的逃避方式，但你让我清醒了，让我恢复了理智……"

"Then I accept your apology," Shinji answered. "I now understand."  
"那么我接受你的道歉，" 真嗣回答道，"我现在明白了。"

"Thanks," Misato spoke sadly, gesturing with a finger crossing her chest over the heart, a solemn promise. "I'm not going to do that again, ever."  
"谢谢，" 美里悲伤地说道，用手指在胸前交叉，做出一个庄严的承诺，"我再也不会那样做了，永远不会。"

Misato thought for a moment, and then said, "I should have said this for a long time but we can't live on while we blame ourselves. The more we worry, the more we can't move on. Then we get so paralyzed with self-blame that we can't stop more bad things from happening. So the best thing we have to do is to think and talk about the better days, the only things that can at least prevent us from going nuts, and then move on if we can."  
美里沉思片刻，然后说道："我早就该说这句话了，但我们不能一边自责一边活下去。我们越是担忧，就越难以向前迈进。最终，我们会被自我责备所困，以至于无法阻止更多坏事的发生。所以，我们能做的最好的事情就是思考和谈论那些美好的日子，这是唯一能让我们至少不至于发疯的方法，然后如果可能的话，继续前进。"

For a while they looked at the stars and the distant glow at the horizon, wondering what else to say.  
他们凝视着星空和地平线远处微弱的光芒，一时之间不知该说些什么。

"One question, have you told us what you were doing at my age?" Shinji asked, wishing to change the subject.  
“一个问题，你有没有告诉我们你在我这个年纪时在做什么？”真嗣问道，想换个话题。

"No… Not until now," Misato answered. "I'm just like you, trying to live an ordinary life, going to school but being at home was far from everyone else's families. I come home after school, and all I see is my mom crying on the table or shouting at Dad on the phone, telling him to drop his damned project and go home. Made me worried about the neighbors at first as they fought every night, but later on I learned that I could shut all that shit out with my earphones on while finishing my homework."  
“没有……直到现在才说，”美里回答道，“我和你一样，试图过普通的生活，上学，但家里和别人家大相径庭。放学回家后，我看到的总是妈妈在桌边哭泣，或者对着电话向爸爸大喊，让他放弃那个该死的项目回家。起初我还担心邻居们会听到他们每晚的争吵，但后来我学会了戴上耳机做作业，把那些噪音隔绝在外。”

"Sounds like Father," Shinji said. The disc jockey on the radio was now playing Linkin Park's "Leave Out All the Rest".  
“听起来像爸爸，”真嗣说道。电台的唱片骑师现在正在播放林肯公园的《Leave Out All the Rest》。

"Yeah, right," Misato agreed. "I always envied my classmates everyday, wishing at least Dad should be like their fathers who can understand both me and my mom. But when you're a scientist's daughter and all day he thinks about the Nobel Prize while at the lab, it's hard to have a good life. So the only thing better for me then was to go downtown with my 'Yankee' classmates till past midnight. Drinking, partying, dating, smoking, or for some of these girls, try _enjou-kosai –_ streetwalking – and fuck an old businessman with a Benz for chump change to buy expensive stuff; or worse, drugging themselves with ravers' tablets or hitting a marijuana joint. But what they're doing is too far, and I avoid being dragged into such traps, so the only vice I did was getting drunk."  
“是啊，没错，”美里附和道。“我每天都羡慕我的同学们，希望至少我爸爸能像他们的父亲那样理解我和妈妈。但当你是一个科学家的女儿，而他整天在实验室里想着诺贝尔奖时，很难过上好日子。所以对我来说，唯一更好的事情就是和我的‘不良’同学们一起在市区逛到深夜。喝酒、聚会、约会、抽烟，或者对这些女孩中的一些人来说，尝试 enjo-kosai——街头拉客——和开着奔驰的老商人做爱，只为了一点零花钱去买昂贵的东西；或者更糟的是，服用狂欢者的药片或抽大麻。但她们做的事情太过分了，我避免被拖入这样的陷阱，所以我唯一的恶习就是喝醉。”

Shinji nodded, and then drank more of his beer. "Just like running away," he said after a gulp, still grimacing from the bitter aftertaste.  
真嗣点点头，然后又喝了一口啤酒。“就像逃避一样，”他咽下一口后说道，仍然因为苦涩的余味而皱眉。

"That's how we tried to deal with the pain and broken homes. Escape is all we knew then, as most of my generation only understood after the bubble burst; those born in the eighties grew up in a nice house with parents having a fat paycheck everyday, then suddenly the economy goes south on them, suddenly their parents lost their jobs, and quickly those kids were struggling for their lives by the time they finish high school or college; working part-time, going from one job to another, but never finding the right one. There's no real security, and all we do to alleviate the boredom was to escape for even one night."  
那就是我们试图应对痛苦和破碎家庭的方式。逃避是我们当时唯一知道的，因为我的大多数同龄人都是在泡沫破裂后才明白的；那些八十年代出生的人，从小住在大房子里，父母每天都有丰厚的薪水，然后经济突然转向南方，他们的父母突然失业，这些孩子高中或大学毕业后很快就挣扎求生；兼职工作，从一个工作跳到另一个，但从未找到合适的。没有真正的安全感，我们为了缓解无聊所做的就是逃避，哪怕只是一夜。

Misato looked into Shinji's eyes and said, "Strange, we're sharing a common sentiment; we're trying to run away, not wanting to face the music. That's why I'm trying to confront my issues now, and that's why right here and now I'm sharing my past with you, so I hope you could do the same for me."  
美里凝视着真嗣的眼睛说：“奇怪，我们有着共同的情感；我们试图逃避，不想面对现实。这就是为什么我现在试图面对我的问题，这就是为什么此时此地我与你分享我的过去，希望你也能为我做同样的事。”

Kaworu was back from dinner, and after he was out of the elevator, he approached the nurses' duty station where Nurse Chigusa – Miss Takako Chigusa, RN as her desk plaque proclaimed her name – was sitting behind the counter, busying herself with a nail file while a stack of finished reports were on the counter, and her iPod was playing the latest _enka_ hit from Jero. Chigusa glanced up at the young man with gray hair.  
渚薰刚吃完晚饭回来，电梯门一开，他就走向了护士值班台。在那里，千草护士——她的桌牌上写着“千草贵子，注册护士”——正坐在柜台后，忙着用指甲锉修整指甲，一叠已完成的工作报告堆在柜台上，她的 iPod 正播放着杰罗的最新演歌热门单曲。千草抬头看向这位灰白头发的年轻人。

"What can I do for you, Mister…?" she asked, brushing her long pony-tailed black hair away from her elfin-shaped face to the back of the neck.  
“有什么我能帮您的吗，先生……？”她问道，将她那长长的马尾黑发从精灵般形状的脸庞上拂到颈后。

"I'm Kaworu Nagisa, one of the Eva pilots," he said, introducing himself. "I would like to visit Miss Langley."  
“我是碇真嗣，EVA 驾驶员之一，”他自我介绍道，“我想探望兰格雷小姐。”

"Oh," Chigusa blurted, before looking up at the wall clock. "Isn't it a little past the usual visiting hours?" She pointed at the poster listing several visitation rules.  
"哦，"千草脱口而出，随后抬头看向墙上的时钟。"这不是比平常的探访时间晚了一点吗？"她指着贴有几条探访规则的海报。

"But I need to see her now, even if she's asleep."  
"但我现在必须见她，即使她睡着了。"

Takako Chigusa weighed on his suggestion, before she quickly grabbed a keycard and stood up. "Come with me," she said, walking out of her station.  
千草高子权衡了他的建议，随即迅速抓起一张门禁卡站起身来。"跟我来，"她说着，走出了她的工作站。

They walked along the hallway, past Rei, who was sleeping in her room at the moment, and then they came upon Asuka's door. Chigusa swiped the keycard in and the door lock clicked to open. Before Kaworu could go inside, the nurse gave him a reminder.  
他们沿着走廊走去，经过此刻正在房间里睡觉的丽，然后来到了明日香的门前。千草刷了一下钥匙卡，门锁咔嗒一声打开了。在碇真嗣进去之前，护士提醒了他一句。

"I'll allow you only up to an hour, and afterwards, you'll have to go. That's all the time you can have."  
“我只允许你待一个小时，之后你就得离开。这是你能拥有的全部时间。”

Kaworu nodded. "I understand," he replied.  
碇真嗣点点头。“我明白，”他回答道。

Chigusa smiled. "Thanks, Mister Nagisa. Call me through the intercom when you need something or when you're about to leave. I'll be waiting at my station."  
千草微笑道：“谢谢，渚先生。需要什么或者准备离开时，通过对讲机叫我一声。我会在岗位上等候。”

"Thank you, too, ma'am. I'll keep that in mind."  
“也谢谢您，女士。我会记住的。”

The nurse left him and Kaworu shut the door gently. He walked up and sat on a chair besides Asuka's bed and then he looked at the girl lying in repose. He also noticed the thick bandages on her wrists, a sign she tried to take her life. On her face was an expression of mixed anger and sadness, as it was obvious she was dreaming something cruel. The only movement she made was the heaving of her chest while breathing, and sounds merely the rhythm of her breathing and the beeping monitors that showed her vital signs. Above the bed, fixed to the wall and close to the ceiling, was a CCTV camera. He wasn't sure who's watching her, but anyway he looked up to the camera and smiled. He hoped that the guy keeping them under surveillance was okay and didn't mind him being here.  
护士离开后，渚轻轻关上门。他走到床边坐下，凝视着躺在床上的明日香。他注意到她手腕上厚厚的绷带，那是她试图结束生命的痕迹。她脸上混合着愤怒与悲伤的表情，显然正梦见某些残酷的事情。她唯一的动作是随着呼吸起伏的胸膛，房间里只有呼吸的节奏声和显示生命体征的监护仪的哔哔声。床上方，靠近天花板的位置，固定着一台监控摄像头。他不确定是谁在监视她，但还是抬头对摄像头微笑了一下。他希望负责监控的人没事，不介意他在这里。

"Here goes nothing," he intoned almost quietly.  
"就当是试试看吧，" 他几乎轻声细语地说道。

Kaworu took a deep breath and gently took hold of her right hand. He now felt the psychic link as they made contact, but this time he could control the flow as he closed his eyes. In this state he saw flashes of light and images, mostly consisting of her memories and thoughts. He could hear her yell, scream, whine, and every one of her lamentations, until he found himself standing in the middle of an arid field of dried grass. But this wasn't a pastoral scene.  
渚薰深吸了一口气，轻轻握住了她的右手。当他们接触时，他感受到了心灵上的联系，但这次他可以控制这种流动，于是他闭上了眼睛。在这种状态下，他看到了闪光和图像，主要是她的记忆和思绪。他能听到她的呼喊、尖叫、抱怨，以及她的每一次哀叹，直到他发现自己站在一片干枯的草地上。但这并不是一幅田园风光。

It was more like a war zone or a cemetery, skulls and femurs scattered here and there.  
这更像是一个战场或墓地，到处散落着头骨和股骨。

The sky was blood-red and the clouds were dark and ominous, foreboding of death. The air was still and lifeless, but reeking with the sharp smell of burned sulfur and blood, while the reddish sun shone like the evil eye of Sauron affixed onto the mournful heavens.  
天空血红，云层深沉而险恶，预示着死亡的降临。空气静止且毫无生气，却弥漫着硫磺烧焦与血腥的刺鼻气味，而那红日如同索伦邪恶的眼睛，凝视着哀伤的天穹。

_This is her dream,_ Kaworu thought. _No, it's her nightmare. Death and death is everywhere._  
这是她的梦，渚薰心想。不，这是她的噩梦。死亡无处不在，充斥着一切。

He glanced around to take in his surroundings, and espying a house nearby, he walked to that direction.  
他环顾四周，观察周围环境，发现附近有一座房子，便朝那个方向走去。

---

Around the abandoned, wrecked house were dead trees, with not even one brown-aged leaf on their branches. The tall grass that grew over the front yard was dry and yellowed.  
废弃破败的房屋周围，枯死的树木上连一片枯黄的叶子都没有。前院里长满的高草干枯泛黄。

The house itself was half-destroyed, its roof shorn free of its ceramic tiles and the walls were decaying and infested with termites. The rice-paper doors were ripped and punched out, and the tatami mats inside the house were ancient, encrusted with dust.  
房子本身已半毁，屋顶的瓷砖不见踪影，墙壁腐朽且遭白蚁侵蚀。纸门被撕裂、穿破，屋内的榻榻米陈旧不堪，积满灰尘。

It would have been a world of nothing but death and sadness, of humanity faded into non-existence, had it not for existence of this melancholic, lonely young girl who was soaking in a bathtub full of dirty water. Besides was a chair with her clothes, neatly folded.  
若非有一个忧郁孤独的少女正泡在满是脏水的浴缸里，这里本该是一片死亡与悲伤交织、人类痕迹荡然无存的世界。旁边一把椅子上，她的衣物整齐地叠放着。

This was one of Asuka's nightmares, and she was by herself, wishing to die.  
这是明日香的一个噩梦，她独自一人，渴望死去。

Her hair was messed up and moist with the same dirty water, Asuka was pale-faced with catatonia, distant blue eyes staring at the bloody sky above that she can see through the huge maw where the roof once used to be. The showerhead protruded into her line of vision, and she could see the encrusted rust on it.  
她的头发凌乱且湿透了，沾满了同样肮脏的水，明日香面色苍白，陷入木僵，遥远的蓝眼睛凝视着血红的天空，那是她透过曾经是屋顶的巨大裂口所能看到的。淋浴喷头突兀地闯入她的视线，她能看到上面结着的锈迹。

Tears ran down her cheeks... as she thought of the great folly of her boisterous words from years before:  
泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落……当她回想起多年前自己那些喧闹话语的巨大愚蠢时：

"_Mommy! Mommy! They selected ME!"  
"妈妈！妈妈！他们选中我了！"  
"I'm an elite pilot, ready to protect mankind! The best in the world! It's a secret to everybody, but I'll tell you mom! Everybody is so nice and so cool to me, and I'm not lonely... I'm OK, even though I don't have Father... Look at me! Look at me!"  
"我是一名精英飞行员，准备好保护人类了！世界顶尖的！这是个对所有人保密的事，但我会告诉妈妈你的！大家都对我很好，很酷，我不孤单……我没事，即使没有爸爸……看看我！看看我！"  
"Hey Mom—"  
TWACK!_

"S... Sync rate zero..." she mumbled sadly, her hands shaking. "I'm not worthy... no reason to exist..."  
"同……同步率为零……"" 她悲伤地喃喃自语，双手颤抖。""我不配……没有存在的理由……"

Sobs followed with tears streaking on her dirtied cheeks.  
哭泣声伴随着泪水在她沾满尘土的脸颊上划过。

"No one looks at me... everybody hates me... ignores me... There's no reason... no reason for me to... live."  
“没有人看我...每个人都讨厌我...忽视我...没有理由...我没有理由...活下去。”

With great, painful effort, Asuka reached her hand out to a soap dish, except that the object that was in her grasp was not a bar of soap, but a piece of razor-sharp glass. The shining object of death gleamed with the faded reddish light, as Asuka slowly let it come close to her wrist, preparing to cut deep into the flesh.  
阿斯卡用极大的、痛苦的力气伸出手去拿肥皂盒，但握在手中的不是一块肥皂，而是一片锋利的玻璃。在褪色的红光下，这闪耀的死亡之物闪烁着，阿斯卡缓缓地让它靠近自己的手腕，准备深深地割入肉中。

But just as she was about to make the final, fatal gesture of her self-defeat, a human voice rang out of nowhere.  
但就在她即将做出自我毁灭的最后致命动作时，不知从何处传来了一个人的声音。

"Asuka Langley Soryu, I presume?"

Startled, the voice alone caused Asuka to drop the glass shard onto the floor.  
这突如其来的声音让明日香吓了一跳，她手中的玻璃碎片应声落地。

"W... What?" she whispered.  
“什……什么？”她低声呢喃。

"What you're doing is futile," the voice warned back. It was a young man's voice, mature-sounding in the way he spoke as if he had learned a great deal about the world.  
"你所做的一切都是徒劳的，"那个声音警告道。这是一个年轻人的声音，他的说话方式显得成熟，仿佛他已经对这个世界有了深刻的了解。

"Leave me alone!" she suddenly yelled out, making the water around her to splash, shattering the melancholy away instantly from her heart.  
"别管我！"她突然大喊起来，激起周围的水花四溅，瞬间将她心中的忧郁击碎。

"I can't," the voice refused, "Because if I leave you, then you will learn nothing from me. You will lose everything and things can get worse if you try to kill yourself."  
"我不能，"那个声音拒绝道，"因为如果我离开你，那么你将无法从我这里学到任何东西。你会失去一切，如果你试图自杀，情况可能会变得更糟。

"I don't give a fuck about you, so leave me alone and let me die!" Asuka cursed, her teeth angrily clenched, wishing she had the strength to get up and slap this intruder in the face.  
"我根本不在乎你，所以别来烦我，让我去死吧！" 明日香咒骂道，牙齿愤怒地紧咬，恨不得有力气站起来给这个闯入者一记耳光。

Disappointed, the unseen voice sighed. "No way shall I leave you alone, unless you have to listen to me."  
失望之下，那看不见的声音叹了口气。"除非你听我的，否则我绝不会让你一个人待着。"

"Who are you? What the hell you want? Are you the Angel that screwed me?" Asuka desperately questioned back.  
"你是谁？到底想干什么？你是那个害我的使徒吗？" 明日香绝望地反问道。

"No," the persistent voice disagreed. "If I was that Angel, then I would've killed you right now by making you brain-dead. But I have no malicious urge to kill anyone, not even you, because I have a good reason to be here. And I am not an Angel."  
"不，"那个坚持的声音反驳道，"如果我是那个天使，那我现在就会让你脑死亡来杀了你。但我没有恶意去杀任何人，甚至是你，因为我有充分的理由在这里。而且，我不是天使。"

"Answer me! What do you want from me?"  
"回答我！你想要从我这里得到什么？"

"I want to be your friend and I want to help you," the voice reasoned, "because you're drowning and I'm not going to be here and watch you die for nothing."  
"我想成为你的朋友，我想帮助你，"那个声音解释道，"因为你正在沉沦，而我不会在这里无所作为地看着你死去。"

"You're not my friend. Go away!"  
"你不是我的朋友。走开！"

"Face the truth, then. Who was the first person who really cared for you?"  
"那就面对现实吧。第一个真正关心你的人是谁？"

"What?"

"That person may be the only one who does love you, because that same person has understood who and what you are. I know that you hate certain kinds of people whom you think are lesser than you... when in fact they're just as strong and weak as you are, albeit much differently. So think about it before you die in that corner, for it is the fate of everything that's at stake."  
"那个人可能是唯一真正爱你的人，因为那个人已经理解了你的本质。我知道你讨厌某些你认为比你低贱的人……实际上，他们和你一样有强有弱，只是方式不同。所以在你死在那个角落之前好好想想，因为这关系到一切的命运。"

By the sheer force of this stranger's intuition and knowledge of her grave situation, Asuka was silenced.  
仅仅凭借这位陌生人的直觉和对她的危急情况的了解，明日香被沉默了。

"You're smart, I believe, and I expect that you should be capable of solving your problems so easily. So we go back to the first question: who is the first person you know who cared and worried about you?"  
“你很聪明，我相信，而且我预计你应该能够轻易解决你的问题。所以我们回到第一个问题：你认识的第一个人是谁，他关心你并为你担忧？”

Asuka resignedly hung her head, and gave out the first sane answer. "Hikari," she whispered.  
明日香无奈地低下头，给出了第一个理智的回答。“光，”她低声说道。

The voice sighed. "Hikari... So she is the one person who knows what's wrong with you, but was there was a time when both of you disagreed?"  
那声音叹息道：“光……她是唯一知道你哪里不对劲的人，但你们曾经有过意见不合的时候吗？”

Asuka shook her head. "No... I have never done anything bad to her... It's... It's just that we have something in common," she admitted and let off a sigh. "Well... Because I feel that we're above everyone else."  
明日香摇了摇头。“不……我从没对她做过什么坏事……只是……我们有些共同点，”她承认道，叹了口气。“嗯……因为我感觉我们比其他人都要优秀。”

"Still," the voice intoned, "It is good to know that despite your differences in terms of social status, you did become friends... But, what do you think of the other people around you?"  
“尽管如此，”那声音说道，“知道尽管你们在社会地位上有差异，却还是成为了朋友，这很好……但是，你对周围其他人有什么看法呢？”

"I don't like them..."  
"我不喜欢他们..."

"Why?"

"Because... they're different... they suck."  
"因为...他们不一样...他们很糟糕。"

"Ah..." the voice answered, "There's one more catch, however. Have you understood about what's ticking beneath Shinji? Or even within Rei? Or the sad facade that's beneath Misato's smile?"  
"啊..." 那个声音回答道，"不过，还有一个关键点。你了解真嗣脚下正在倒计时的东西吗？或者甚至在绫波体内？还有美里笑容下隐藏的悲伤面具？"

"No!" Asuka loudly spat back.  
"不！" 明日香大声回呛道。

"No? I want something to tell you about these people, Asuka. They nearly have the same problems as you are, that is, growing up hard and bitter, their inner pain drawn from their respective pasts. And you, of course, seen the worst of your life. Your mother died by her hand, am I right?"  
"不？我想告诉你一些关于这些人的事，明日香。他们几乎和你有着同样的问题，那就是艰难而苦涩地成长，内心的痛苦源自各自的过去。而你，当然，经历了人生中最糟糕的部分。你的母亲是自杀身亡的，对吧？"

That touched a chord in Asuka's heart. "Y... Yes," she mumbled. "She told me to... Die with her."  
这话触动了明日香的心弦。"嗯... 是的，"她喃喃道，"她告诉我... 和她一起死。"

The voice sighed. "Is it the greatest fear you've seen?"  
那声音叹息道：“这是你见过的最深的恐惧吗？”

"Yes..."

"So that's one of the cruel visions that you always wanted to run away from... Hmmm, just as I thought of what Shinji did -- running away from fear caused by the past..."  
“所以这就是你一直想逃避的残酷幻象之一……嗯，正如我想象真嗣所做的——逃避由过去引发的恐惧……”

Asuka frowned and shouted, "Because he's a coward!"  
明日香皱眉大喊：“因为他是个懦夫！”

"Imprecise, but listen to me," the voice countered. "Committing suicide is a futile gesture, because by killing yourself, common sense is relinquished and the love for life. And Shinji isn't what you think. He is, from what I have heard from him, a person with a traumatic past who just happens to be stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time... Thrown into a very dangerous situation he had never experienced before. So you're no different from him."  
"不精确，但听我说，"那个声音反驳道。"自杀是一种徒劳的举动，因为通过结束自己的生命，你放弃了常识和对生活的热爱。而真嗣并不是你所想的那样。据我从他那里听到的，他是一个有着创伤过去的人，只是恰巧在错误的时间出现在了错误的地点……被卷入了一个他从未经历过的极其危险的境地。所以你和他并没有什么不同。"

"Why did you pull Shinji into this?" Asuka questioned.  
"你为什么要把真嗣卷进来？"明日香质问道。"

"Because I have understood what's wrong with him, so I am doing all of this explaining to you to set everything straight before it's too late. And so it's up to you to decide whether you stay here and suffer... or you can will yourself to wake up from this nightmare and live again. As your new lifeguard, I want you to think about it, and when you have an answer, I'm ready to listen and help you out."  
"因为我已经明白了他的问题所在，所以我正在向你解释这一切，以便在为时已晚之前把事情理清楚。现在，选择权在你手中，你可以选择留在这里受苦……或者你可以让自己从这场噩梦中醒来，重新开始生活。作为你的新救生员，我希望你好好考虑一下，当你有了答案时，我随时准备倾听并帮助你。"

"But..." Asuka trailed away and tried to get up, but she couldn't, realizing that her feet were deadened and unable to move.  
“但是……” 明日香话音渐弱，试图起身，却发现自己双脚麻木，无法动弹。

So she remained still in the tub full of dirty water, deciding whether to live or to die.  
于是她静静地躺在满是脏水的浴缸里，思索着是生还是死。

_When I was younger 当我年幼时  
I saw my daddy cry  
And curse at the wind  
对着风咒骂  
He broke his own heart  
他伤了自己的心  
And I watched 我看着这一切  
As he tried to reassemble it  
当他试图重新组装它时_

The rock station was on the opening verses of Paramore's "The Only Exception". Misato heard the song five years ago, and it struck her then how much it paralleled her life. Now that the song was being played again, it reminded her once more of Kaji.  
摇滚电台正在播放 Paramore 的《The Only Exception》的开场歌词。五年前 Misato 第一次听到这首歌，当时就深深触动了她，觉得与自己的生活如此相似。如今再次听到这首歌，她又一次想起了 Kaji。

"How appropriate," Misato remarked about the song, remembering the lyrics.  
“多么贴切，”Misato 对这首歌评论道，回忆着歌词。

"You mean the song?" Shinji asked, trying not to sound drunk. Already they were at their second can of Yebisu, and there on the table was a half-full plate of takoyaki that Shinji cooked in the microwave oven.  
"你是说那首歌？" 真嗣问道，尽量不让自己听起来醉醺醺的。他们已经喝到了第二罐惠比寿啤酒，桌上还有一盘真嗣用微波炉烤的章鱼烧，已经吃了一半。

Misato chuckled and then added, "Yeah, he's my exception. I can remember everything about him."  
美里轻声笑了起来，然后补充道："是啊，他是我的例外。关于他的一切，我都记得清清楚楚。"

Oh, in her thoughts she imagined Kaji's hugs and kisses, his characteristic warmth and charm, his sense of humor and the little jokes she laughed at. Once more she remembered the scent of his cologne, the stubble on his chin, the ripples of his chest and pectorals, and, above all, the pain as he entered into her. Good God, everything came back to her, the things she once used to do with Kaji, every single moment like they happened yesterday.  
哦，在她心中，她想象着加持的拥抱和亲吻，他特有的温暖和魅力，他的幽默感和那些让她发笑的小玩笑。她再次记起了他古龙水的香味，他下巴上的胡茬，他胸肌的起伏，以及最重要的是，当他进入她时的那种痛楚。天哪，一切都回到了她的记忆中，那些曾经和加持一起做过的事情，每一个瞬间都像是昨天才发生过。

"The first time I heard it, Kaji and I were at a beer joint in Hamburg, just after we got accepted into Gehirn, and you know, later became NERV. After a few bottles, he asked me if we could dance, and I said, yes. On the floor, he told me if it's okay if he could try to mend our bridges again after we broke up for a year."  
"第一次听到这首歌时，我和加持在汉堡的一家啤酒馆，刚被 Gehirn 录取，后来就成了 NERV。几瓶酒下肚，他问我能不能跳舞，我说，好啊。在舞池里，他问我，分手一年后，我们能不能试着修复关系。"

Shinji tried to picture Misato and Kaji dancing together, their bodies intertwined as the music played.  
真嗣试图想象美里和加持一起跳舞的情景，他们的身体随着音乐交织在一起。

"Told him it's all right, as at the time I was then doubtful about my love life: after I broke up with Kaji for the first time, I tried dating other men, but didn't have what I wanted. They expected their women to be soft and compliant, like some mail-order bride, and I wasn't. Hell, they couldn't stand me at all. So I was back to square one with Kaji, even though I was afraid of him because he makes me think too much of my father."  
"我告诉他没关系，那时我对爱情生活感到迷茫：第一次和加持分手后，我尝试和其他男人约会，但找不到我想要的感觉。他们希望女人温柔顺从，像邮购新娘一样，而我不是。见鬼，他们根本受不了我。所以我回到了和加持的原点，尽管我害怕他，因为他让我想起了太多关于我父亲的事。"

Misato took a swig from her can, as talking about Kaji somehow made her feel better.  
美里从罐子里喝了一口，谈论起加持似乎让她感觉好些了。

"Next thing afterwards, despite being unsure, I was stuck with him again; he taught me to ride a surfboard while on vacation; went onto long road trips across Germany and into Switzerland, where he gave me tips on how to deal with the S-curves while driving; we rode the ICE train to Berlin where we walked under the trees at the parks there, then treated me to dinner, talking about our work, and well, I think you know what happens afterwards, just like in the movies. He tried to make me happy in any way he could, encouraged me to forget about the reason for the scar on my body."  
接下来，尽管不确定，我又和他在一起了；他在度假时教我冲浪；我们长途旅行穿越德国进入瑞士，他教我如何在驾驶时应对 S 形弯道；我们乘坐 ICE 列车前往柏林，在那里我们在公园的树下散步，然后他请我吃晚餐，谈论我们的工作，嗯，我想你知道后来发生了什么，就像电影里那样。他尽其所能让我快乐，鼓励我忘记身上伤疤的原因。

"After about eleven months, Kaji was reassigned to take care of Asuka, and I was being sent to another NERV posting. We had a little farewell dinner at Frankfurt, before my flight, just said our goodbyes without regret, but deep inside I knew that we would be seeing each other soon, though I was then doubtful if the flame ever to be reignited again. He may be a bit like my father, but it's hard to forget."  
大约十一个月后，加持被调去照顾明日香，而我被派往 NERV 的另一个岗位。我们在法兰克福共进了一顿告别晚餐，然后在我起飞前简单地道别，没有遗憾，但内心深处我知道我们很快会再见，尽管那时我怀疑这火焰是否还能再次点燃。他有点像我的父亲，但很难忘记。

Finally she remembered the drunken night about confessing to Kaji about her real sentiments, her dreams and fears, but otherwise he smothered her with his kiss, a moment when her mind went blank, all of her personal misgivings washed away in the torrent of that single kiss.  
最终，她想起了那个醉酒的夜晚，关于向加持坦白她的真实情感、梦想和恐惧，然而他以一个吻将她淹没，那一刻她的思绪一片空白，所有的个人疑虑都在那一吻的洪流中被冲刷殆尽。

_I've got a tight grip on reality  
我对现实有着牢牢的掌控  
But I can't  
Let go of what's in front of me here  
放开我眼前的一切  
I know you're leaving 我知道你要离开  
In the morning, when you wake up  
清晨醒来时  
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream  
请留下某种证明，这不是梦境_

Misato closed her eyes, as she lip-synched to the remaining lyrics, her mind's eye looking back when they were kissing under that clear night sky, a moment when they were alone and they had the right to lose themselves.  
美里闭上眼睛，随着剩余的歌词轻声哼唱，脑海中浮现出他们在那个晴朗的夜空下亲吻的情景，那一刻他们独处，有权迷失自我。

_And I'm on my way to believing  
而我正走在相信的路上  
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing  
哦，我正走在相信的路上_

Kaworu, remaining in Asuka's dream and still telepathically linked to her, never showed himself to the girl as he watched her from the corner, this time the girl was no longer in the tub but instead she was pacing around, fully clothed in her school uniform, on the platform of a train station. There were no passing trains, there was nobody else waiting but Asuka.  
渚薰留在明日香的梦中，依然与她心灵相通，却从未现身。他站在角落里观察着她，这次女孩不再泡在浴缸里，而是穿着校服在火车站台上踱步。没有过往的列车，也没有其他候车的人，只有明日香一人。

"To live… then what I can do?" Asuka asked. Now she remembered Rei's warning about closing her heart and mind from her Eva.  
“活着……那我能做什么呢？”明日香问道。此刻她记起了绫波零关于封闭心灵和思维的警告。

"It's my fault," she mumbled. "But how can I open myself?"  
“这是我的错，”她喃喃自语，“但我该如何敞开心扉呢？”

"The only way you can do is to open your heart to others," Kaworu said, now appearing before Asuka. She blinked twice.  
"敞开心扉去接纳他人，这是你唯一能做的，"渚薰说道，此刻出现在明日香面前。她眨了两次眼。

"W… Who are you? Are you the one who talked to me?" she asked, flabbergasted.  
"你…你是谁？是你刚才跟我说话的吗？"她惊讶地问道。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I am. My name's Kaworu Nagisa, but don't get angry at me."  
渚薰点头。"是的，我就是。我叫渚薰，但请不要对我生气。"

Wishing to grab the collar of his shirt, and to blast him out with her fury, Asuka tried to move but she was frozen in place, her feet unable to move an inch. She frowned, her teeth clenched.  
想要抓住他的衣领，用怒火将他轰出去，但明日香试图移动时却发现自己动弹不得，双脚无法挪动分毫。她皱起眉头，牙齿紧咬。

"That Eva of yours isn't going to move unless you're willing to open your heart," Kaworu reminded her.  
“你的 Eva 不会动，除非你愿意敞开心扉，”渚薰提醒她。

"Isn't it what Wondergirl said to me, am I right?" Asuka questioned. "She thinks I'm real stupid not to do that… but now… I think she's right."  
“这不是绫波丽对我说的话吗，我说得对吧？”明日香质疑道，“她觉得我真的很蠢，竟然不这么做……但现在……我想她说得对。”

Kaworu sighed. "Trying to shut out the past isn't going to help," he said. "You have to let go, accept the past as the truth as it's not going to go away."  
渚薰叹了口气。“试图屏蔽过去并不能解决问题，”他说，“你必须放手，接受过去作为不可改变的事实，因为它不会消失。”

"Forgetting it is the only way I can be strong!" Asuka yelled back.  
“忘记它是让我变得坚强的唯一方法！”明日香大声反驳。

"You're doing it wrong," Kaworu answered. "Listen to me, the more you deny the past, the more it'll haunt you until it'll consume you completely. I don't know whether you'll like it or not, but I have seen more of your past than you could ever imagine."  
“你这样做不对，”渚薰回答，“听我说，你越是拒绝过去，它就越会缠绕你，直到完全吞噬你。我不知道你是否会喜欢，但我看到的你的过去比你想象的还要多。”

Asuka was again surprised, her rage stopped cold. "You have seen everything about me? All of it?"  
明日香再次感到惊讶，她的怒火瞬间凝固。“你已经了解了我的一切？所有的？”

Kaworu nodded. "That's right. You're really an orphan, having lost your mother when she attempted what is called a contact experiment with your Eva, and from there you became a different person. Your father went on to marry his mistress, and you were so angry about her, thinking she messed up your life and all. Piloting Eva was then your only option to be different, to be on top, but also to deny the past. You believed that by being a pilot, you derive strength and integrity, yet now you fell down so hard you couldn't get up."  
渚薰点头。“没错。你确实是个孤儿，母亲在你试图与 Eva 进行所谓的接触实验时去世，从此你变得判若两人。你的父亲娶了他的情妇，你对此愤怒不已，认为她毁了你的生活。驾驶 Eva 成了你唯一的出路，既是为了与众不同，站在顶端，也是为了否认过去。你相信通过成为驾驶员，你能获得力量和正直，但现在你跌得如此之重，以至于无法再站起来。”

The redhead was silenced again, inwardly astonished that this Kaworu Nagisa knew it all, even the ones that she thought she had forgotten.  
红发少女再次沉默，内心震惊于这个渚薰·真嗣竟然知道这一切，甚至是那些她以为自己已经遗忘的事情。

"That's not all. I wonder why you're trying to get along with a man named Ryoji Kaji," he added. "Does trying to be with him make you feel like a… how you say it, a grown-up?"  
"不仅如此。我好奇你为何要与一个名叫加持良治的男人搞好关系，"他补充道，"试图与他在一起会让你觉得自己像……怎么说呢，像个成年人吗？"

"I was wrong," Asuka said, almost mumbling, "Completely wrong. He couldn't accept what I am... even as I tried…"  
"我错了，"明日香几乎喃喃自语，"完全错了。他无法接受我……即使我努力尝试……"

"Then I'm afraid he's correct," Kaworu answered. He knew what she was about to say next about popping open her blouse before Kaji in the middle of the night, on the deck of an aircraft carrier. He also knew what Asuka said before that man, lying on the deck and trying to ignore her advances.  
"那么恐怕他是对的，"渚薰回答。他知道她接下来要说什么，关于她在午夜时分在航空母舰的甲板上向加持敞开衬衫的事。他也知道明日香在那个人躺在甲板上试图忽视她的示好之前所说的话。

On the platform's floor, Asuka went down onto her knees, as if she was tired of it all.  
在平台的地上，明日香跪了下来，仿佛她已经厌倦了一切。

"I've lost, you see," Asuka whispered, covering her face with both palms. "Everything's gone, I'm so wrong, and so all I had to try is to kill myself."  
"我输了，你看，"明日香低声说，双手捂住脸。"一切都失去了，我错得离谱，所以我唯一能尝试的就是自杀。"

"You can't," Kaworu said. "Shinji was real worried about you, just as he was worried about Rei. Well, almost everyone's worried about you."  
"你不能，"渚薰说。"真嗣真的很担心你，就像他担心绫波一样。嗯，几乎每个人都担心你。"

Asuka looked up, palms taken away. "Why?"  
明日香抬起头，手掌移开。“为什么？”

Kaworu sat down on the floor and faced Asuka. "To be fair to you, he's really anxious about everyone around him, except maybe for his father. Well, in your case he couldn't just live being alone, or at least someone he wanted to talk to, so you're one of the few persons left to be the ones he can communicate with. He's also the only one who, correct me if I'm wrong, keep your feelings in check as well as taking care of the things you have. Another thing I found out is that there's really no difference between the both of you: no mothers, with weaknesses, and many reasons to run away. I understand that your mother tried to kill you, am I right?"  
渚薰坐在地板上，面对着明日香。“为了公平起见，他真的很担心周围的人，除了可能他的父亲。嗯，在你这里，他不能只是孤独地生活，或者至少有个人他想与之交谈，所以你是少数几个他能沟通的人之一。他也是唯一一个，如果我错了请纠正我，能帮你控制情绪并照顾你所拥有的一切的人。我还发现你们俩之间真的没有区别：没有母亲，都有弱点，有很多理由逃避。我理解你的母亲试图杀死你，对吗？”

Asuka hung down her head. "Y… Yes, she did," she whispered.  
明日香低下头。“是……是的，她确实这么做了，”她低声说道。

"Perhaps that's not her that you've seen on that day," Kaworu said. "Perhaps she lost a part of herself so that she was no longer the mother you recognize."  
"或许那天你看到的并不是她，"渚薰说。"也许她失去了一部分自己，不再是那个你所认识的母亲了。"

From Asuka's back he saw a younger version of herself being strangled down by her mother, wearing a hospital gown, with both hands gripping the girl's neck. Displeased, Kaworu blotted out the image away.  
从背后看去，他见到一个年轻的自己被母亲扼住，身穿病号服，双手紧握着女孩的脖子。渚薰不悦地抹去了这个画面。

"Now, let me tell you something: once you let your hatred and that self-delusion consume you there's nothing else you can recover. Then you're really gone, you lose your sense of humanity. I tell you again, you have to accept the past and let it go, and only then you find your own measure of peace as well as peace with your fellows. Be yourself, never be pretentious, and then you will live, and you'll discover true happiness. Of course, by that time your Eva will move again, as you should know that Evas have their own minds."  
"现在，让我告诉你一件事：一旦你让仇恨和自我欺骗吞噬了你，就再也无法找回其他东西。那时你就真的消失了，失去了人性。我再次告诉你，你必须接受过去并放下它，只有这样你才能找到自己的平静，以及与他人的和解。做你自己，永远不要虚伪，这样你才能活下去，并发现真正的幸福。当然，到那时你的 EVA 会再次动起来，你应该知道 EVA 有自己的思想。"

Asuka sighed. "So, does it mean that I have to change myself?"  
明日香叹了口气。“所以，这是不是意味着我得改变自己？”

Kaworu smiled. "That's right, as long as you just have to do it right. There's so much in you to live for. I'm not joking; you could also do a lot of good."  
渚薰微笑着说：“没错，只要你做得对就行。你身上有太多值得活下去的东西。我不是在开玩笑；你也能做很多好事。”

The gray-haired young man now offered his hand to her. Asuka for a moment, hesitated, before she took his hand into hers and both of them stood up. The redhead took a deep breath and tried to give her best impression before Kaworu.  
灰白头发的年轻人这时向她伸出手。明日香犹豫了一会儿，然后握住了他的手，两人一起站了起来。红发女孩深吸一口气，努力在渚薰面前展现出最好的一面。

"I'll try," Asuka said, but with a weak smile. "You could be right."  
"我试试看，" 明日香说道，但脸上带着一丝勉强的微笑。"你可能是对的。"

"One more thing, though," Kaworu spoke, inwardly happy to see Asuka recover a measure of self-confidence. "I believe that ever since you were put into sedation Shinji really wants to see you wake up."  
"还有一件事，" 渚薰说道，内心为看到明日香恢复了一些自信而感到高兴。"我相信自从你被麻醉后，真嗣一直很想看到你醒来。"

"Me?"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I guess he's thinking of you most of the time, so I think you should talk to him. Negotiate and understand both of your own situations, and don't hesitate about bringing out your past. However, I don't know but have you… touched lips with him, is it correct?"  
渚薰点头。"是的，我想他大部分时间都在想着你，所以我认为你应该和他谈谈。协商并理解彼此的处境，不要犹豫提及过去。不过，我不确定，但你……和他接过吻吗，是这样吗？"

Asuka glowered, as if Kaworu never heard of kissing. "You mean kissing? Well, yes we did."  
明日香瞪了他一眼，仿佛渚薰从未听说过接吻。“你是说接吻？嗯，是的，我们确实接吻了。”

"Ah, kissing," Kaworu answered, repeating the word in his mind, recalling about giving Rei the breath of life, before he chuckled. "Thanks for correcting me," he added, scratching his head as though clearly embarassed.  
“啊，接吻，”渚薰回答，在心中重复这个词，回想起给绫波注入生命之息的那一刻，然后轻声笑了起来。“谢谢你纠正我，”他补充道，挠了挠头，显然有些尴尬。

"My pleasure. I kissed Shinji just to try him out. Why did you ask?"  
“不客气。我只是吻了真嗣来试试他。你为什么问这个？”

Kaworu shrugged, with shoulders aloft. "I was just wondering about it."  
渚薰耸了耸肩，双肩高耸。“我只是有点好奇。”

There was a silent moment between them, before the Fifth Children decided that it was his time to go.  
他们之间静默了一会儿，随后第五适格者决定是时候离开了。

"Are you ready to take my advice when you wake up?" Kaworu asked.  
“你醒来后准备好接受我的建议了吗？”渚薰问道。

"I'm not sure, but I'll give my best shot," Asuka answered.  
"我不确定，但我会尽我最大的努力，" 明日香回答道。

"It's no different from piloting Eva, but life's more challenging because I know there's much more besides being an Eva pilot."  
"这与驾驶 EVA 没什么不同，但生活更具挑战性，因为我知道除了成为 EVA 驾驶员之外，还有很多其他的东西。"

"I'll learn about that, too. Thanks… What's your name again?"  
"我也会去了解那些的。谢谢……你叫什么名字来着？"

"Kaworu Nagisa."

Asuka nodded. "Thanks, Kaworu, I think I could sleep well."  
明日香点点头。“谢谢你，薰，我想我能睡个好觉了。”

"No problem. I might see you later," Kaworu answered. "Don't refuse any help if you're real stuck, so remember that."  
“没事。我晚点可能会见你，”薰回答道，“如果真的遇到困难，不要拒绝帮助，记住这一点。”

The gray-haired stranger vanished from the platform, leaving Asuka alone on the station platform. The redhead yawned as she went for the benches and lay down as if she was about to take a nap.  
灰发的陌生人从站台上消失了，留下明日香独自一人。红发的她打了个哈欠，走向长椅，躺下仿佛准备小憩一番。

"He's right," she whispered to herself, slowly falling to sleep. "There's a lot to… live for."  
"他说的对，" 她轻声自语，渐渐沉入梦乡。"还有很多……值得活下去的理由。"

The dreamworld around Asuka quickly winked out of existence.  
明日香周围的梦境世界迅速消失无踪。

---

Kaworu opened his eyes and shook his head. Now, standing up from his seat, he looked at Asuka, who was still unmoving. This time her facial expression was relaxed, a telling sign that Kaworu hoped she took his advice to heart.  
薰睁开眼睛，摇了摇头。他站起身来，看向明日香，她依旧一动不动。这次她的表情放松了，这让薰希望她真的听进了他的建议。

Satisfied with his attempt at communicating with Asuka within, Kaworu went to a waiting intercom and pressed a button for Takako Chigusa, who was at her duty station.  
对与内心世界的明日香沟通的尝试感到满意，渚薰走向等待中的对讲机，按下了联系冰笠多加子岗位的按钮。

"I'm done," Kaworu said into the speaker.  
“我完成了，”渚薰对着扬声器说道。

The towering twelve slate-black monoliths appeared at once before Gendo Ikari, who looked unfazed at their sudden arrival. As if it the digits were glowing, hostile-red eyeballs, SEELE 01 stared down at the bearded Commander, and the remaining monoliths would serve as mute witnesses of the verbal battle that was to begin.  
十二座高耸的深黑色石碑突然出现在碇源堂面前，他对此突如其来的出现显得毫不动容。仿佛这些数字化作了发光的敌意红眼，SEELE 01 俯视着留着胡须的指挥官，而其余的石碑则将作为这场即将展开的言语之战的沉默见证者。

"I know what you will be asking from me," Gendo said. "I do not hide anything."  
"我知道你会向我提出什么要求，" 碇源堂说。"我没有任何隐瞒。"

"Yes," Keel answered from behind his electronic monolith. "Care to explain what happened, and what are you doing with the Evangelions?"  
"是的，" 基尔从他的电子巨石后回答。"愿意解释一下发生了什么，以及你和那些福音战士在做什么吗？"

"It was a routine experiment, a test run. I planned to reinstate the First Children for duty, with a compatibility test with Unit One, should there would be any foreseeable operational problems with the other Children."  
"那是一次常规实验，试运行。我计划让第一适格者恢复职责，进行与初号机的适配测试，以防其他适格者在操作中出现任何可预见的问题。"

Keel grumbled. "And it failed, am I correct?"  
基尔咕哝道：“结果失败了，我说的没错吧？”

With two fingers, Gendo merely adjusted his glasses as if he acknowledged his mistake. "Yes, but it was unavoidable," he said calmly. "When we deal with the Evas, however, there is always little room for error, and we all know that and their tendency to be unpredictable. Therefore, in the final analysis of this attempted test, I have decided not to have it repeated again."  
源渡只是用两根手指调整了一下眼镜，仿佛在承认自己的失误。“是的，但这是不可避免的，”他平静地说，“当我们与 Eva 打交道时，犯错的余地总是很小，我们都知道这一点，以及它们难以预测的倾向。因此，在这次尝试测试的最终分析中，我决定不再重复。”

"Then why did you have the Fifth Children involved?"  
“那为什么还要让第五适格者参与？”

"It is necessary that we must have someone to keep an eye on the First and to assist her should a problem arises, just as what happened yesterday."  
"我们必须有人时刻关注着司令，并在出现问题时协助她，就像昨天发生的那样。"

Inwardly, Gendo was irritated to know that someone on the inside probably snitched on his activities, and he would have to deal with it after this meeting. He could not believe that there were still some leaks coming out of here even after several tight rings of security.  
内心深处，碇源堂对内部可能有人泄露他的活动感到恼火，他打算在会议结束后处理此事。他无法相信在严密的安全措施下，仍有泄密事件发生。

"Besides his guardian duty on that day, do you have anything else to say about his other activities?" Keel questioned.  
"除了那天的守护职责外，关于他的其他活动，你还有什么要说的吗？"基尔问道。

Gendo shook his head. "Nothing, except what he was required to do according to your directives, especially as he is the replacement for the Second Children."  
源渡摇了摇头。“没什么，除了按照你的指示他必须做的事情，尤其是作为第二适格者的替代。”

"Speaking of the Second Children, do you have further plans for that young woman?"  
“说到第二适格者，你对那个年轻女子有什么进一步的计划吗？”

"No, except I have determined that it is necessary that due to her psychological condition and therefore she is no longer able to pilot, she would be discharged from active duty effectively today this afternoon."  
“没有，只是我已确定鉴于她的心理状况，她不再适合驾驶，因此从今天下午起她将被正式解除现役职务。”

"I see," Keel said. "So after many months of her trying to prove her worth, in the end this Second Children is now a liability, and surprisingly expendable. What a waste of money, all because of childhood trauma that the Angel was able to exploit her only weakness."  
"我明白了，"基尔说。"经过她数月努力证明自己的价值后，这个二号适格者如今成了负担，甚至出乎意料地可有可无。真是浪费金钱，全因童年创伤成了使徒利用她的唯一弱点。"

Gendo said nothing, but not making any expression nor a gesture. He knew they were all watching him, but inside he had no regrets sending Asuka back to where she came from.  
碇源堂一言不发，没有任何表情或动作。他知道他们都在注视着他，但内心对将明日香送回原处毫无悔意。

"What about Doctor Akagi?" Keel inquired.  
"那赤木博士呢？"基尔询问道。

"Despite her incarceration, I intend that she will remain here for our purposes. Her absence does not affect our day-to-day operations, in any way, as I have already selected Doctor Natsumi Odani, a knowledgable replacement with similar skills. In addition, her subordinate Lieutenant Ibuki knows the workings of the MAGI and, based on previous experience, is able to work on her own without further guidance. Unlike Akagi, and as they are loyal, they will not countermand any order I issue."  
"尽管她已被监禁，我打算让她留在这里为我们所用。她的缺席对我们的日常运作没有任何影响，因为我已经选定了同样技能娴熟的替代者——博士夏美小谷。此外，她的下属伊吹副官熟悉 MAGI 系统，并根据以往经验，能够独立工作无需进一步指导。与赤木不同，他们忠诚可靠，不会违抗我下达的任何命令。"

Behind their monoliths, Keel and the rest of the Committee opened the electronic dossier on Odani and quickly scanned her brief biography. Some of them felt pleased with Gendo's choice of replacement, but Keel had something else in mind.  
在他们的巨石碑后，基尔和委员会的其他成员打开了关于小谷的电子档案，迅速浏览了她简短的生平。其中一些人对于源渡选择的替代者感到满意，但基尔另有打算。

"Now, however, have you found the Fifth Children suitable for your purposes?"  
"然而现在，你找到适合你目的的第五适格者了吗？"

"Yes," Gendo answered, "there was no doubt about him and his abilities. He has surpassed all our expectations."  
“是的，”源度回答，“对他的能力和才华毋庸置疑。他已经超出了我们所有的预期。”

Behind the monolith, Keel shook his head in disbelief and pleasure. He couldn't believe that Gendo had taken his bait, hook and sinker, not realizing Kaworu's true potential.  
在巨石背后，基尔摇着头，既难以置信又感到愉悦。他没想到源度如此轻易地咬住了他的诱饵，完全没意识到渚薰真正的潜力。

"For a moment, let us first deliberate regarding your recent actions," he said, before the entire Committee put Gendo on hold.  
“让我们先就你最近的行动进行讨论，”他在委员会全体让源度暂时等待之前说道。

As the Commander was waiting, standing in attention, the rest of the Committee debated on Gendo's character and actions, with Keel listening to their opinions. Behind their digital monoliths, at least three members decided on a wait-and-see attitude, arguing that Ikari can be monitored; another three considered about paring down the current NERV budget to only half as a penalty; then one demanded that Ikari should be replaced by a more competent and compliant leader; but the remaining membership merely listened.  
指挥官正等待着，立正站好，委员会的其他成员则在辩论源渡的性格和行为，基尔在听取他们的意见。在他们背后的数字巨碑后，至少有三名成员决定采取观望态度，认为碇可以被监控；另外三人考虑将当前 NERV 的预算削减至一半作为惩罚；还有一人要求用一个更有能力且顺从的领导者替换碇；但剩下的成员只是静静听着。

Until Keel, as the final decision-maker, gave word that he has made a judgment after the rest conceded on a single resolution.  
直到基尔，作为最终决策者，发话说他在其他人达成单一决议后做出了判断。

"Unanimously, we are satisfied by your explanation regarding the matter about your experiment turned into a costly blunder, and thus we forgive you for this deviant transgression by admitting responsibility and then promising us that you will no longer repeat failed initiatives any further."  
“一致同意，我们对您关于实验演变成代价高昂的失误的解释感到满意，因此我们原谅您这次越轨行为，只要您承认责任并承诺不再重复失败的举措。”

Keel paused to clear his throat.  
基尔停顿了一下，清了清喉咙。

"We, however, give you one final warning: this is the last time we will tolerate any of your maverick actions as a Commander, as you are deviating further from our plans. From now on, because of severe time constraints, there will be no second chances, no reprieves, no appeals, and strictly no more room for errors. If you or your subordinates break any of our directives, then our decisions will be final and binding, our collective judgment is yours to take, and our penalties will be exacting and harsh. Is that clear, Commander Ikari?" Keel asked loudly, tapping out the last five words with an index finger on his desk as if to emphasize them.  
“然而，我们给你最后一次警告：这是我们最后一次容忍你作为指挥官的越轨行为，因为你正越来越偏离我们的计划。从现在开始，由于时间极其紧迫，不会再有第二次机会，不会有缓刑，不会有上诉，严格来说不会再有任何犯错的余地。如果你或你的下属违反了我们的任何指令，那么我们的决定将是最终且具有约束力的，我们的集体判断由你承担，我们的惩罚将是严厉且严苛的。明白了吗，碇司令？”基尔大声问道，用食指在桌子上敲出最后五个字，仿佛在强调它们。

There was sudden silence after Keel's final question, with the rest of the Committee waiting for Gendo's reply.  
基尔的最后一个问题之后，突然陷入了一片寂静，委员会的其他成员都在等待着碇的回答。

"Yes, I will take your word. There will be no mistakes this time," he lied, hoping that these old fools would believe him again.  
“是的，我会相信你的话。这次不会再有差错了，”他撒谎道，希望这些老傻瓜会再次相信他。

At least they never knew all along that he has full possession of Adam in his palm, and in addition he was also determined to survive long enough to see the fruition of his life's work and finally come face to face with his wife.  
至少他们一直不知道，他完全掌控着亚当，而且他还决心活足够长的时间，见证自己毕生工作的成果，并最终与妻子面对面。

Misato and Shinji were on their last cans of Yebisu when it was his turn to talk. Already the alcohol has exacted a hard toll on his body, making him dizzy, and yet also wondering if he could keep on being awake should Misato demand for a second six-pack from the refrigerator. This time, the rock station on the radio was playing Smashing Pumpkins' "Landslide".  
当轮到他说话时，美里和真嗣已经喝完了最后一罐惠比寿啤酒。酒精已经对他的身体造成了沉重的负担，让他感到头晕，同时也在想，如果美里要求从冰箱里再拿一打啤酒，他是否还能保持清醒。这次，电台的摇滚频道正在播放碎南瓜乐队的《山崩》。

"I don't know what I could talk about, but…" Shinji trailed away, "I wonder if it's okay if I could talk about the girls."  
"我不知道该聊些什么，但是……" 真嗣话说到一半，"我在想，聊聊女生们可以吗？"

Misato nodded. "Sure, I'm all ears."  
美里点点头。"当然，我洗耳恭听。"

"I told you about me talking to Ayanami, and she told me about the times when we were together. I liked her then, but not something like love… I can't say what kind of relationship was that."  
"我跟你提过我和绫波的对话，她告诉了我我们一起度过的时光。那时候我对她有好感，但并不是爱情那种……我也说不清那是什么样的关系。"

"I think it's called a platonic relationship," Misato corrected him. "You're very close friends with the opposite sex, but not really lovers."  
"我想那叫柏拉图式关系，"美里纠正他。"你们是非常亲密的异性朋友，但并非恋人。"

Shinji nodded. "I get it. You see, I'm not falling for her completely, not romantically, but anyway I helped her whenever she had a problem, like when she tried to make some tea and got her fingers burned. Or when she had an issue with her school papers, and I… I mean, me and Toji had to bring to her those papers."  
真嗣点点头。"我明白了。你看，我并没有完全爱上她，不是浪漫的那种，但无论何时她遇到问题，我都会帮忙，比如她尝试泡茶时烫伤了手指。或者她学校作业有问题时，我和东治得把那些作业给她送去。"

The young man sighed. "I _like_ her, in a certain way, but I wanted her to be at least happy, and I was sure she was growing up inside until Unit Zero was destroyed. But now, I'm really glad to see her back, though she seems to be spending more time with Kaworu."  
年轻人叹了口气。"我对她有一定的好感，但我希望她至少能快乐，我确信她在零号机被毁之前一直在成长。但现在，看到她回来我真的很高兴，尽管她似乎花更多时间与薰在一起。"

Misato shrugged. "Okay, there's something else apart from telling him what happened down there, as the Sub-Commander told me about Rei, just before Unit One went nuts... He said he's responsible for her, but that's all. Later he never brought it up again as we were too busy doing damage control."  
美里耸了耸肩。“好吧，除了告诉他下面发生的事情，副司令在初号机发狂前告诉我关于绫波的事……他说他对她负责，但也就这些。后来他再也没提起过，因为我们忙着进行损害控制。”

"How? Why?"

"I don't know. Maybe he was involved in creating dozens of her, or he might be even the one who _actually_ created Rei."  
“我不知道。也许他参与了制造她的众多克隆体，或者他甚至就是实际创造绫波的那个人。”

Shinji blinked, wondering how Misato came to that conclusion. "You mean… in a sense he's her _father_?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，好奇美里是如何得出这个结论的。“你的意思是……从某种意义上说，他是她的父亲？”

"It's possible, because I believe that, on the basis of Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki's background, Rei was probably created as a test subject for stem cell, rapid cell regeneration and cloning research, which would have been very useful for Eva R&D. You can't build an Eva without first learning advanced bioengineering and cloning on a smaller scale. Of course, there's also the possibility that there's more to Rei than we ever know, like she was used in constructing the Dummy Plug."  
"这是有可能的，因为我相信，基于副司令官冬月先生的背景，零可能是作为干细胞、快速细胞再生和克隆研究的试验对象而被创造出来的，这对 Eva 的研发非常有用。没有在小规模上学习先进的生物工程和克隆技术，是无法建造 Eva 的。当然，也有可能零还有我们未知的更多秘密，比如她被用于构建傀儡插头系统。"

"It… It makes sense," Shinji said, "Just like connecting the dots."  
"这…这说得通，" 真嗣说，"就像连点成线一样。"

Misato shook her head. "Whatever role the Sub-Commander has played in making Rei, I feel that he'd been forced under pressure to accomplish the tasks given to him. Now he's real worried about what else your father could do with Rei and the rest of you guys, so lately he's soft on us, trying to help in any way he could, trying to keep your father's tendencies in check."  
美里摇了摇头。"无论副司令官在制造零的过程中扮演了什么角色，我觉得他是在压力下被迫完成任务的。现在他真的很担心你的父亲还会用零和你们其他人做什么，所以最近他对我们很宽容，尽力帮助我们，试图控制你父亲的倾向。"

Shinji remembered something else coming from the aftermath of Ritsuko's actions down at the Dummy Plug Plant: he wondered what connection Rei had with his mother? And what his father was trying to do with them?  
真嗣记得在律子博士在模拟插入栓工厂的行动之后，还有些事情浮现出来：他想知道丽与他母亲有什么联系？还有他父亲试图用她们做什么？

Sure, he could connect the dots, but what connects them? What was the truth? Of course the only ones who could answer more of his gnawing questions were Fuyutsuki and Doctor Akagi.  
当然，他可以把这些点连起来，但连接它们的又是什么？真相是什么？当然，能回答他更多迫切问题的只有副司令冬月和博士赤木律子。

Now since his father and Ayanami could not provide the truth, it made sense that he should talk to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, except that the old man must first be persuaded to bring the secrets out into the light. Further persuasion may not be necessary in this case, however, as seen from the deteriorating relationship between those two NERV leaders over his father's actions.  
既然他父亲和绫波无法提供真相，那么他应该去找副司令冬月谈谈，这很合理，只是得先说服这位老人把秘密公之于众。不过，从那两位 NERV 领导因他父亲的行为而关系恶化的情况来看，进一步的说服或许并不必要。

As the coming end looms near, does it mean that the lines are being drawn? Drawn between those who agree with his father, and those who don't? Or, depending on the truth, can this nightmare train continue to hurtle onto an uncertain destination, or be ground to a halt in the middle?  
随着终结的临近，这是否意味着界限正在被划定？划定在那些赞同他父亲的人和那些不赞同的人之间？或者，基于真相，这场噩梦列车能否继续冲向一个不确定的目的地，还是会在中途被强行停下？

Whatever the case, Shinji realized that this morass he was in is bigger than he ever expected, and there's this jigsaw puzzle of the entire picture that was missing the pieces, he must find each and every one of them.  
无论如何，真嗣意识到他所陷入的困境比他预想的要大得多，而且这幅全貌的拼图缺失了许多碎片，他必须找到每一个。

So far he only had half the picture, and maybe even less.  
到目前为止，他只拥有一半的画面，甚至可能更少。

"Anyway, you still have any issues with Asuka?" Misato asked, changing the subject.  
"总之，你对明日香还有任何问题吗？" 美里换了个话题问道。

"No," Shinji disagreed, his reverie snapped out, "not anything bad, but she's still in my mind, too. I kinda missed the way she does whenever I'm stuck with her. I don't care now if she were to be back, even if she shouts at me again. But in my heart I'm sure she'll be different."  
"没有，" 真嗣反驳道，思绪被打断，"没有什么不好的，但她仍然在我脑海中。我有点怀念她在我身边时的样子。现在即使她再对我大喊大叫，我也不介意她回来。但在我心里，我相信她会有所不同。"

"Funny, but the other day in the car, I heard you saying that you kissed her," Misato remarked.  
"有趣的是，前几天在车上，我听到你说你吻了她，" 美里评论道。

"It's true I did," Shinji answered, quickly blushing. "I tried, but I couldn't follow her up and found myself needing a breath. Can't tell why she asked me to do it, except maybe she was testing me."  
"确实如此，" 真嗣回答道，脸颊迅速泛红。"我尝试了，但我跟不上她，发现自己需要呼吸。不知道她为什么让我这么做，可能只是在考验我吧。"

Misato shook her head, snickering. "You're supposed to do at least move your lips a bit to have a small opening just to catch a breath, like this singer who sometimes moves his lips to between his lines to get some air."  
美里摇了摇头，窃笑道："你应该至少稍微动动嘴唇，留一个小口以便呼吸，就像那个歌手有时会在两句之间动动嘴唇来换气一样。"

Shinji sulked. "And I don't know as I'm really dumb at it. How can I do it right as she pinched my nose because she thinks my breathing ruins the kiss?" he complained.  
真嗣沮丧地说："我真不知道自己是不是真的很笨。她捏住我的鼻子，认为我的呼吸破坏了吻的感觉，我怎么能做得对呢？" 他抱怨道。

"Good grief, she's doing it wrong," Misato said, before laughing out loud. "When kissing, try to be natural and go with the flow. Don't be afraid to have a bit of head and body movement, because just being frozen right there gives no meaning to the kiss. It's entirely an expression of your mind, heart and body. As if it's not enough, cup her chin gently with your hand to keep your lips planted properly. Don't push too hard, but be slow and gentle."  
"天哪，她做得不对，" 美里说道，随后放声大笑。"接吻时，要自然些，顺其自然。不要害怕头部和身体的轻微移动，因为僵硬不动会让吻失去意义。这完全是心灵、情感和身体的表达。不仅如此，还要用你的手轻轻托住她的下巴，确保双唇贴合得当。不要用力过猛，要缓慢而温柔。"

Shinji nodded, reimagined the scene with Asuka but differently. "Now I got what you mean." The young man wistfully smiled.  
真嗣点点头，重新想象了与明日香的那一幕，但有所不同。"现在我明白你的意思了。" 年轻人若有所思地笑了。

"By the way… I wondered if Fuyutsuki got my request through," Misato said. "I bet that given that he's close enough to your father than anyone else, Asuka could be out of here sooner than we expect."  
"话说回来…我在想，不知副司令是否收到了我的请求，" 美里说道。"我敢打赌，既然他与你父亲关系如此密切，明日香可能会比我们预想的更早离开这里。"

"But she may not be able to pilot anymore," Shinji spoke, abruptly concerned.  
“但她可能再也无法驾驶了，”真嗣突然担忧地说道。

"It would be the least of her problems. At best, she could at try a bit to be normal again, but at worse she could remain as she is right now. Actually, it's really up to her whether she could change or not, as long as she doesn't do anything drastic to endanger herself like following her mother's footsteps."  
“那将是她最微不足道的问题。最好的情况下，她或许能尝试一点点恢复正常生活，但最坏的情况是她可能保持现状。实际上，她能否改变完全取决于她自己，只要她不做任何极端的事情危及自己，比如追随她母亲的脚步。”

Shinji took a drink from his can, swallowed, and then said, "I think there's little difference between us, though, just as you said about her life back at Hikari's. Maybe we'll understand each other, then. Maybe then I could make up all the mistakes I made with her."  
真嗣从罐子里喝了一口，咽下后说道：“我想我们之间并没有太大差别，正如你提到她在光家里的生活时所说的那样。也许那时我们能互相理解，也许那时我能弥补对她所犯的所有错误。”

Misato sighed as an idea entered her thoughts.  
美里叹了口气，一个念头闪过她的脑海。

"Know what?" she said, "I was wondering what would happen should our job's done here in this place, like what if we defeated all the Angels? Me, I don't know but if we win, I think I could just go back to normal, like becoming a teacher… What about you?"  
"知道吗？" 她说，"我在想，如果我们在这里的工作完成了，比如我们打败了所有的使徒，会怎么样？我，我不知道，但如果我们赢了，我想我可以回到正常生活，比如成为一名教师……你呢？"

"Me?"

"Yeah, I don't really know how you'll end up once all of this is over."  
"是啊，我真的不知道这一切结束后你会变成什么样。"

"I just want to forget all of this and live like everyone else. I want some peace, I want to learn, I don't want to think about the nightmares I had, I like to be feeling okay while being with my buddies, and I don't want to spend my days looking behind my back, or wondering how much praise I could get. I want to be ordinary."  
"我只想忘记这一切，像其他人一样生活。我渴望安宁，想要学习，不想再回想那些噩梦，我喜欢和伙伴们在一起时感觉良好，不想整天回头张望，或琢磨能得到多少赞誉。我只想做个普通人。"

Misato got up from her chaise and sat on the edge, and holding her can, prepared to toast with Shinji. The young man raised his can as well.  
美里从躺椅上起身，坐在边缘，拿着她的罐头，准备与真嗣碰杯。年轻人也举起了他的罐头。

"Well, to those who left before us, and to world peace… Fuck war," she avowed.  
"好吧，为了那些先我们而去的，为了世界和平……去他妈的战争，"她断言道。"

Surprised, Shinji shook his head at her cursing, but he smiled weakly, figuring that she was getting tired of the morass they were stuck in. "Fuck war," he agreed.  
惊讶之余，真嗣对她咒骂的反应是摇了摇头，但还是虚弱地笑了笑，心想她大概也对这泥潭般的处境感到厌倦了。“去他妈的战争。”他附和道。

And their cans clanked together, before in unison they emptied the remaining Yebisu down and straight into their guts.  
他们的罐子叮当作响地碰在一起，然后齐声将剩下的惠比寿啤酒一饮而尽，直灌入肚。

In his room and lying on his futon, finally able to retire for the evening after what amounted to a very long day, Kaworu was contemplating at what would happen in the next few days, guessing whether his presence has altered everything at NERV. Sure, he knew that SEELE would be expecting results, sure they wanted their plans to be on track, but today's events have changed him as well. He wondered what everyone else was doing at the moment.  
在自己的房间里，躺在被褥上，终于在漫长的一天后得以休息，渚薰思索着接下来几天会发生什么，猜测自己的存在是否改变了 NERV 的一切。当然，他知道 Seele 期待着结果，当然他们希望计划按部就班，但今天的事件也改变了他。他好奇此刻其他人都在做什么。

"I don't know how my actions would affect you all, but all I wanted is to make yourselves get ready for the worst," he whispered to himself.  
"我不知道我的行为会如何影响你们，但我所希望的只是让你们为最坏的情况做好准备，"他低声自语道。

"Because… I will be the prelude to the end of all things."  
"因为……我将是一切终结的前奏。"

For a moment he imagined Rei facing him, and added, "I hope in the end you'll also understand me and my reasons."  
有那么一刻，他想象着丽面对着他，补充道："我希望最终你也能理解我和我的理由。"

One final thing bothered him, though.  
然而，还有一件事让他感到困扰。

What if Asuka wakes up the next morning and finds out that he's the current pilot of her Eva? Given her temper, Kaworu hoped in some way, by explaining properly, then she must calmly accept the fact that he's her replacement, and that she needed a break.  
如果明日香第二天早上醒来，发现他现在是她的 Eva 的驾驶员怎么办？考虑到她的脾气，渚薰希望，通过好好解释，她应该能平静地接受这个事实，即他是她的替代者，而她需要休息一下。

Kaworu yawned before he closed his eyes. _I'll never know what would happen next._  
渚薰打了个哈欠，然后闭上了眼睛。我永远不知道接下来会发生什么。

---

**About seven hours later… 大约七个小时后……**

Asuka woke up with a start, her eyes blinking and trying to adjust themselves to the glare of the morning sun reflected from the Geofront's solar condenser blocks, but because of her prolonged sleep it took a while to focus her eyes. She could also smell the heavy pine-scent of Lysol that was mopped onto the floors, and heard the life-support systems beeping.  
明日香突然醒来，眼睛眨动着试图适应从地底都市太阳能聚光块反射的刺眼晨光，但由于长时间的睡眠，她的眼睛需要一段时间才能聚焦。她还能闻到地板上被拖过的消毒水浓重的松木味，并听到生命维持系统的哔哔声。

"Where am I?" she demanded, and she remembered that last night she had an exceptionally vivid dream, talking about her feelings and a painful past to someone she never met before. _I should've asked where he came from_, she thought_._  
“我在哪儿？”她质问道，随即记起昨晚她做了一个异常生动的梦，向一个从未谋面的人倾诉了自己的感受和痛苦的过去。她想，我应该问问他从哪里来的。

_This Kaworu Nagisa guy… He's dressed like Shinji, but… I never met such a really nice guy, telling me, yes, to live. Strangely, I even managed to smell him… like he smells like, uh, incense wood just like the priests use in Shinto temples around here.  
这个渚薰…他穿着和真嗣一样的衣服，但是…我从没遇到过这么好的人，他告诉我，是的，要活下去。奇怪的是，我甚至能闻到他的气味…就像他闻起来像，呃，沉香木，就像这里的神社里的祭司用的那种。_

Raising her arms, Asuka glanced at her wrists, covered in gauze and bandages. _Stupid me, what a dumb mistake I did…_ _He's right. I should make today the Day One of my life, and I want to get out of here,_ she vowed_. I want to try again, and I must come to terms with myself._  
她举起双臂，看着手腕上缠着的纱布和绷带。我真傻，犯了个多么愚蠢的错误…他说得对。我应该把今天当作我生命的第一天，我发誓要离开这里。我想再试一次，我必须与自己和解。

_I want to kick some ass again!  
我要再次大展身手！_

Now Asuka was quickly aware of the IV needle on her right arm and electrodes all over her chest. She grimaced in disgust, as they wired her completely.  
此刻，明日香迅速察觉到右臂上的静脉注射针和胸前遍布的电极。她厌恶地皱起眉头，因为这些设备将她完全束缚住了。

_Ah, screw all of this junk!  
啊，去他的这些破烂玩意儿！_

Without hesitation she tore them off, wincing in pain as she pulled out the IV needle. Noting that her gown was wide open, white panties and her bare chest exposed, she struggled to fasten each button as well. She hoped to steal a pair of janitor's coveralls or surgical green pants and try wearing them while on the way out; no way someone's gonna take a peek at her ass even in her seemingly decrepit state.  
她毫不犹豫地撕掉了它们，拔出静脉注射针时疼得皱眉。注意到自己的病号服大敞着，白色内裤和裸露的胸部暴露无遗，她努力地一个个扣上扣子。她希望能偷到一套清洁工的工装裤或手术绿裤，在逃跑途中穿上；无论如何，在她这看似虚弱的状态下，绝不能让人窥见她的屁股。

Asuka willed herself to get her feet going, first trying to move her toes and feet, testing to see if they were still okay. She then flexed every one of her legs, and her knees were adequate, hopefully not completely numbed by the long confinement. _Funny, I'm like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill,_ she mused, _getting out of coma._  
明日香努力让自己动起来，先是尝试移动脚趾和脚，测试看看它们是否还好。接着她弯曲了每一条腿，膝盖还算可以，希望没有因为长时间的束缚而完全麻木。有趣，我就像《杀死比尔》里的乌玛·瑟曼，从昏迷中醒来。

She tried to get up into a sitting position, but it was more like trying to lift a sack of rice until her feet were now hanging from the edge of the bed. She lowered one foot to the floor, and then the other, thinking she could stand on her own. _Here goes nothing._  
她试图坐起身来，但感觉更像是在举起一袋米，直到她的脚悬在床边。她将一只脚放到地板上，然后是另一只，心想自己可以独立站立。就这样吧，没什么好怕的。

But as soon as she stood up, letting free of the bed, Asuka unexpectedly crumpled to the floor, the pain of the impact making her teeth grit harder. She cursed almost silently in three languages, comprehending that her legs were almost numb from the long hours of being stuck in bed.  
但她一站起来，离开床铺，明日香意外地瘫倒在地，撞击的疼痛让她咬紧了牙关。她几乎无声地用三种语言咒骂着，意识到自己的双腿几乎因为长时间躺在床上而麻木。

_Shit, I'll fight anyway,_ she told herself.  
该死，无论如何我都要战斗，她对自己说。

She'll have to be content with crawling her way out. Slowly she was inching forward to the door, every centimeter more like a meter, until she took hold of the door frame. Asuka will have to reach the door knob and open it.  
她只能满足于一步步爬出去。慢慢地，她向前挪动，每前进一厘米都像是一米，直到她抓住了门框。明日香必须够到门把手并打开它。

Like a cat clawing its way up a wall, Asuka exerted every amount of her strength to reach the knob, and now her right hand took hold of it and twisted it open. She was rewarded with a click of the lock and the door slowly swung out.  
就像猫用爪子攀爬墙壁一样，明日香用尽全力去够到门把手，现在她的右手抓住了它并扭开了。她得到了锁的咔嗒声，门缓缓地向外打开。

Asuka poked her head out into the corridor, trying to see if there was any other human traffic. So far there was nobody except for her, silent except for the distant call of the PA system. _The nurse's probably busy at her station, and no guards, too,_ she thought with relief, and began crawling her agonizing way to the elevators.  
明日香探出头来，试图看看走廊里是否还有其他人。到目前为止，除了她自己，没有其他人，除了远处 PA 系统的呼叫声，一片寂静。护士大概在她的岗位上忙得不可开交，也没有警卫，她松了一口气，开始痛苦地向电梯爬去。

_Escape this white hell. Make a break for it, Asuka.  
逃离这个白色地狱。逃跑吧，明日香。_

As she passed by Room 300, Asuka noticed that the door was ajar, and curious about its occupant, she peeked in and was surprised to see who was inside. The occupant was sitting upright on her bed, staring back at her with red eyes, startled by her unexpected appearance.  
当她经过 300 号房间时，明日香注意到门半开着，出于对里面住户的好奇，她偷看了一眼，惊讶地发现里面是谁。住户笔直地坐在床上，红眼睛回望着她，对她的意外出现感到惊讶。

"Wondergirl," Asuka mumbled in bewilderment. "Why are you here?"  
"奇迹少女," 明日香困惑地喃喃自语。"你为什么会在这里？"

**Author's Notes:** Finally, she's back.  
作者笔记：她终于回来了。

To those Asuka fans out there, this is what you were waiting for so long, and I have finally delivered. This is the first installment of what I think could be a three- to five-chapter Asuka story arc.  
对于所有明日香的粉丝们，这就是你们期待已久的，我终于完成了。这是我认为可能成为三到五个chapter明日香故事系列的第一部分。

As this is probably one of the most difficult chapters to deal with so far in _Light and Water Season Two_, it took several nights trying to write and edit this, but six years before, the original version and the entire plot was much wildly different. However, back then I felt it was all too rushed, too forced. So I decided that on the rewrite the flow should be gradual, and with each chapter I have to triumph over every character obstacle I encounter, one roadblock at a time. As usual I make sure the dialogue has as much sense as the description.  
这可能是《光与水》第二季中最难处理的一章，为此我花了几个晚上来写作和编辑。但在六年前，原版和整个情节要狂野得多。然而，那时我觉得一切都太过仓促，太过牵强。因此，我决定在重写时让节奏逐渐展开，并且每次面对角色障碍时，我都要一一克服，一次解决一个难题。一如既往，我确保对话和描述一样富有意义。

I suppose that with this chapter, and at the same time I'm grappling with my personal issues, through my reinterpretation of Kaworu as he was talking to Asuka, I have to follow my own advice about life and how I could overcome my difficulties. I can't allow any problems try to discourage me from writing, as I came to realize that everytime I write a chapter, I make a commitment to myself to live on and fight.  
我想，通过这个章节，同时我也在处理自己的个人问题，通过我对渚薰与明日香对话的重新解读，我必须遵循自己关于生活以及如何克服困难的建议。我不能让任何问题试图阻止我写作，因为我逐渐意识到，每次我写一个章节，我都在向自己承诺要活下去并战斗。

As I will not give up writing _Light and Water_ until the last chapter, I will also never surrender in life. Hope springs eternal, as a famous man once said.  
在写完《光与水》的最后一个章节之前，我不会放弃写作，在生活中我也永远不会投降。正如一位名人曾经说过的，希望永远存在。

So I'm dedicating this chapter to two of my online friends whose mother had recently passed away last weekend.  
因此，我将这篇{{101}}献给两位网友，他们的母亲在上周末刚刚离世。

Finally, FYI, Takako Chigusa is one of the more memorable characters in Koushun Takami's novel _Battle Royale_, which in the later film adaptation was played by actress/model Chiaki Kuriyama (who, apart from being a total video-game junkie, is also said to be an avid Eva fan, as evidenced from the inside of her crib).  
最后，顺便一提，千草貴子是高見広春小说《Battle Royale》中令人难忘的角色之一，在后来的电影改编中由女演员/模特栗山千明饰演（她除了是个彻底的电子游戏迷外，据说还是个狂热的 EVA 粉丝，从她的卧室内部就能看出端倪）。

To my readers, thank you and good evening… and as Megumi Hayashibara had once written, _"The things you see aren't everything."_  
致我的读者们，感谢你们，晚安……正如林原惠美曾写过的，“你所看到的事物并非全部。”

### Chapter 15 Hangover

It was almost eight in the morning when her two-year-old Sony-Ericsson clamshell cellphone shattered the calm.  
当她那款两年的索尼爱立信翻盖手机在清晨八点钟左右打破宁静时，她几乎还没完全醒来。

Misato woke up to this trilling with a grunt of displeasure. Once she opened her eyes, the woman found herself lying on her futon, and she could smell the faint stench of vomit – her own. The sun was now over the horizon, and the beam streaming through her bedroom windows. She then faintly remembered about Shinji leading her to the toilet last night, where they puked together after using up what seemed to be two six-packs of Yebisu while talking about almost everything.  
美里被这阵铃声吵醒，不满地咕哝了一声。睁开眼后，她发现自己躺在被褥上，隐约闻到一股呕吐物的臭味——是她自己的。太阳已经升起，阳光透过卧室的窗户洒进来。她依稀记得昨晚是真嗣把她带到厕所，两人在喝掉了似乎是两箱惠比寿啤酒后，聊了几乎所有事情，然后一起吐了。

_Damn fucking headache_, she cursed inwardly, rubbing her head's temples. The sour vomit had also left a searing pain in her throat. _Feels like we went overboard... unbelievable._  
该死的头疼，她在心里咒骂着，揉着太阳穴。那股酸涩的呕吐感还让她的喉咙火辣辣地疼。感觉我们玩得太过火了...难以置信。

Now she heard what sounded like footfalls outside. Must be Shinji; poor kid was now up, hobbling along the hallway to the bathroom to splash his face, examine himself in the mirror the head-throbbing results of his first alcoholic debauchery, perhaps to congratulate himself for discovering the other side of age twenty early in teenage life, in his miasma of vomit hovering in the air, and hopefully sober enough to make Cup Noodles and the strongest brew of coffee for both of them.  
现在她听到外面传来像是脚步声。肯定是真嗣；可怜的孩子现在起床了，一瘸一拐地沿着走廊去洗手间洗脸，对着镜子审视自己因第一次酗酒而头痛欲裂的样子，也许会为自己在青少年时期就早早发现了二十岁后的另一面而自鸣得意，在空气中弥漫的呕吐气息中，希望他能清醒到足够为两人泡上杯面和冲一杯最浓的咖啡。

But still Misato must answer the phone right now.  
但米莎此刻必须接电话。

"Where the hell is that thing?" she groaned, while pawing her hand around, looking for the vibrating phone until it was in her hands. Misato looked at the displayed caller ID and she realized it was Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki.  
"“那玩意儿到底在哪儿？”她咕哝着，手在周围摸索，寻找着震动的手机，直到它落入手中。美里看着显示的来电号码，意识到是副司令冬月。”

_Oh, shit,_ Misato cursed again.  
“哦，该死。”美里再次咒骂道。

She promptly pried open the phone and answered, "Uh, good morning, sir."  
她迅速打开手机，回答道：“呃，早上好，长官。”

"Good morning, Major," Fuyutsuki greeted, "Given your own habits, I'm not surprised about you waking up very late. Today, you have a special job to do."  
"早上好，少校，" 副司令福音次问候道，"考虑到你平时的习惯，你睡到很晚我并不意外。今天，你有一项特别的任务要完成。"

"Sorry about that, sir," Misato apologized. "What is it?"  
"抱歉，长官，" 美里道歉说，"是什么任务？"

"You're to escort Miss Langley out of here this afternoon, but after she finishes the discharge procedures."  
"你要在今天下午护送兰格利小姐离开这里，但前提是她完成了出院手续。"

With one shoulder Misato pinched the phone to her ear as she stood up, clearing the cobwebs from her eyes. "You mean…" she trailed.  
米萨托用一个肩膀夹着电话站起身来，揉了揉惺忪的睡眼。“你是说……”她话音渐弱。

"About a couple of hours ago, Doctor Odani pulled the medications out of Miss Langley. Yes, although the Commander approved our request last night, I'm afraid that this girl, once she lands on Frankfurt, she'll be an ordinary civilian. It'll be over for her."  
“大约几个小时前，小谷医生从兰利小姐身上取出了药物。是的，虽然司令昨晚批准了我们的请求，但恐怕这个女孩一旦抵达法兰克福，她就会成为一个普通平民。对她来说，一切就结束了。”

Misato groaned. "I understand that, sir," she said.  
米萨托叹了口气。“我明白，长官，”她说道。

"But first, get her belongings ready, the ones she can carry home. Clothes, papers and valuables are only needed. You'll be picked up by an agent in a car, so leave yours instead."  
"但首先，把她的随身物品准备好，那些她能带回家的。衣服、文件和贵重物品就够了。你会被一辆车上的特工接走，所以把你的车留下。"

"Okay, sir," Misato agreed as she began preparing her uniform, laying them out on the futon along with a fresh set of underwear. "Can I bring Shinji along?"  
"好的，先生，"美里答应着，开始准备她的制服，将它们整齐地摆放在蒲团上，还有一套干净的内衣。"我可以带上真嗣吗？"

There was a long pause as Fuyutsuki considered her suggestion, and then he answered, "You may, but as long as you keep an eye on both of them. You and I know that most of the time they're like a married couple… Quarreling, that is."  
福音津考虑了她的提议，沉默良久，然后回答道："你可以，但你必须同时看好他们两个。你我都知道，他们大多数时候就像一对夫妻……吵架的那种。"

On all her fours, Asuka found herself staring at Rei Ayanami, whose reading of a light novel was interrupted, and this prompted the Second Children to ask, "Wondergirl, why are you here?"  
四肢着地，明日香发现自己正盯着绫波零，她的轻小说阅读被打断了，这促使第二适格者问道：“三无少女，你为什么在这里？”

Rei was trying to find the right words, until she answered, "I was injured yesterday in a failed experiment."  
丽正在寻找合适的词句，直到她回答道：“昨天我在一次失败的实验中受了伤。”

"What experiment?" Asuka questioned, as she tried to stand up on her feet, propping herself against the door frame. _Damn it, I wish there was at least a wheelchair or crutches to stand up,_ she thought. _All I want is to talk, and I need to know._  
“什么实验？”明日香问道，她试图站起来，靠在门框上支撑自己。该死，我真希望至少有轮椅或拐杖能站起来，她想。我只想谈谈，我需要知道。

"I tried to be compatible with Unit One, but I failed," Rei said.  
“我试图与初号机兼容，但我失败了，”丽说。

"Where's Shinji?" Asuka demanded, still struggling to be upright.  
"真嗣在哪儿？" 明日香追问道，依旧努力保持直立。

Rei shook her head. "I do not know. Perhaps he could be at home right now, but yesterday he visited me."  
绫波摇了摇头。"我不知道。也许他现在在家，但昨天他来看过我。"

"But what about Misato–" Asuka said, but was cut off when a pair of hands suddenly grabbed her wrists from behind. She turned her head around to see that a burly Caucasian male nurse had his hands on her, and this prompted her to fight.  
"那美里呢——" 明日香刚开口，就被一双从背后突然抓住她手腕的手打断了。她转过头去，看到一个魁梧的白人男护士正抓着她，这让她立刻开始反抗。

"Let GO OF ME!" Asuka yelled in English, trying to kick and punch the nurse. "Damn it, LEMME GO!"  
"放开我！" 明日香用英语大喊，试图踢打护士。"该死，让我走！"

However the nurse, an ex-US Army medic who had seen his share of wounded soldiers brought into a field hospital in Afghanistan, thinking they were still in one piece and tried to get off their beds, and he knew all the tactics his patients would try to resort when escaping. Asuka Langley Soryu was no different from the soldiers he dealt with, and given the height difference and her weakened state he thought she was still easy to handle.  
然而，这位护士曾是美国陆军的一名医疗兵，在阿富汗的野战医院里见过不少受伤的士兵，他们以为自己还能动弹，试图从床上爬起来。他深知这些病人在逃跑时会采取的所有伎俩。惣流·明日香·兰格雷与那些他处理过的士兵并无不同，考虑到身高差距和她虚弱的状况，他认为她还是很容易控制的。

But Asuka proved him wrong, as she was aiming for his nethers and solar plexus.  
但明日香证明他错了，她瞄准的是他的下体和太阳神经丛。

"Calm down!" the nurse answered back. "You're hitting my balls!"  
“冷静点！”护士回道，“你打到我的蛋了！”

At first, Rei watched helplessly as Asuka tried to break free, the nurse trying to pull the girl away, but after twenty seconds the First Children must do something.  
起初，丽无助地看着明日香试图挣脱，护士试图将女孩拉开，但二十秒后，初号机驾驶员必须采取行动。

"Stop," Rei intoned, but the struggling and the screaming continued. Another male nurse, Japanese this time, joined in the fray. This was enough to inflame Rei, as she could remember all too well about the Angel attack that nearly drove Asuka mad.  
“住手，”丽平静地说道，但挣扎和尖叫仍在继续。又一名男护士，这次是日本人，加入了混战。这足以激怒丽，她清楚地记得那次几乎让明日香发疯的天使袭击。

"STOP!" Rei finally uttered out in the strongest voice possible. Astonished by this uncharacteristic outburst, Asuka and the two nurses immediately froze.  
“停下！”丽终于用尽可能强的声音喊了出来。被这反常的爆发所震惊，明日香和两名护士立刻僵住了。

"I'm sorry, we got orders," the first nurse said. "We have no intention to harm her."  
“对不起，我们接到了命令，”第一个护士说，“我们无意伤害她。”

Breathing heavily, Rei noted the nameplates and ranks on the nurses' white blouses. Wilson Derdrick, Staff Sergeant. Keiichi Ayanoshita, Corporal. Her red pupils bore into the nurses' eyes, expressing her total displeasure.  
丽喘着粗气，注意到护士们白色上衣上的名牌和军衔。威尔逊·德德里克，参谋军士。肯一·绫之又，下士。她红色的瞳孔盯着护士们的眼睛，表达出她的极度不满。

"We have to prepare Miss Langley for her checkup," Wilson explained to Rei, as the nurses' slackened their hold on Asuka. They were obliged instead to prop the girl on her feet, and they knew all too well that Rei Ayanami had the full backing of the Commander.  
"我们必须为兰利小姐准备她的体检，"威尔逊向丽解释道，同时护士们放松了对明日香的控制。他们不得不扶着女孩站起来，而且他们非常清楚丽·绫波得到了司令的全力支持。

Asuka blinked. "What do you mean? What the hell's going on?" she insisted. "What's wrong with me coming out of my room, and you clowns tried to grab me?"  
明日香眨了眨眼。"你什么意思？这到底是怎么回事？"她坚持问道。"我出房间有什么问题，你们这些小丑还想抓我？"

"Men, please try to be careful with her," a woman's voice commanded from behind.  
"先生们，请尽量小心对待她，"一个女人的声音从背后传来。

At the same moment they all twisted their necks towards Doctor Natsumi Odani and Chief Nurse Takako Chigusa, who shot at the men with disapproving scowls, and then Natsumi turned her attention to Asuka. Both men gasped.  
就在这一刻，他们所有人都扭头看向了夏美·小谷医生和护士长千草贵子，两人带着不满的皱眉向那些男人射击，随后夏美将注意力转向了明日香。两个男人都倒吸了一口气。

"Miss Langley," Odani said, "Earlier, we disconnected the IV lines supplying you with sedatives, so you managed to wake up. It's my duty to tell you this, but whether you like it or not, you're going home."  
“兰格利小姐，”小谷说，“之前，我们断开了给你输注镇静剂的静脉管路，所以你醒了过来。我有责任告诉你这一点，但不管你是否愿意，你都要回家了。”

Somewhere near Tokyo-3 and in his service van, the killer made a scrambled call to his handler and reported, but added that since Asuka would be accompanied by armed escort, he called up some extra friends from his list of contacts to help him out, and the killer would later plan and supervise the attack.  
在东京-3 附近的某个地方，杀手在他的服务车内给他的联络人打了一个加密电话并汇报了情况，但他补充说，由于明日香将有武装护卫陪同，他联系了一些额外的朋友来帮忙，杀手随后将策划并监督这次袭击。

"Is it necessary?" the handler demanded, sounding almost agitated. "You could just take her out with a sniper rifle, and if she changes her mind and comes back to pilot again..."  
"有必要吗？" 处理者几乎有些焦躁地问道，"你完全可以直接用狙击枪解决她，如果她改变主意回来继续驾驶的话……"

"I don't want to have this left undone," the killer answered, after pausing to put down his coffee cup onto a holder on the dashboard. "I want to make them take notice that NERV's number would be up soon, but I also want to see how they react, as I see this convoy as a mere pretext for a trap. Those men will keep a distance from me and my quarry; there's no way they'll ever know who gave the order to shoot, as they're expendable fanatics who will not talk. Either way, no one should be left alive."  
"我不想留下这个未完成的事，" 杀手回答，在将咖啡杯放到仪表盘上的支架上后停顿了一下，"我想让他们注意到 NERV 的末日即将来临，但我也想看看他们的反应，因为我认为这个车队不过是个陷阱的借口。那些人会与我保持距离，不会知道是谁下的射击命令，因为他们是可牺牲的狂热分子，不会透露任何信息。无论如何，不能留下活口。"

The killer sighed in near resignation.  
杀手近乎无奈地叹了口气。

"If you're worried about the added expenses, it's not a problem. I know these men," he added. "They're worth every dollar, and take my word for it."  
"如果你担心额外费用，那不是问题。我了解这些人，"他补充道，"他们物超所值，相信我的话。"

The handler coughed. "Then do it as soon as possible. I want no stone left unturned. Give them hell."  
处理者咳嗽了一声。"那就尽快行动。我要确保万无一失。让他们大干一场。"

---

At Misato's instructions and despite the mild aftereffects of his very first hangover (even after showering, the strongest coffee and aspirin possible, five minutes of brushing, and a good change of clothes), Shinji Ikari was now packing most of Asuka's clothes and belongings into a pair of gym bags. After her towel and a few pair of jeans and shirts went into one of the bags, Shinji now held aloft the yellow sundress on his hands.  
在美里小姐的指示下，尽管经历了他人生中第一次宿醉的轻微后遗症（即便洗了澡，喝了最浓的咖啡和阿司匹林，刷了五分钟牙，换了干净衣服），碇真嗣现在正将明日香的大部分衣物和物品装进两个运动包里。在将她的毛巾和几条牛仔裤和衬衫放进其中一个包后，真嗣现在双手高举着那件黄色太阳裙。

He remembered her wearing it on the day they first met on the aircraft carrier. In his mind's eye, amidst fighter planes being catapulted and taking off in the background, Asuka then stood proud on the flight deck, with a determined face telling him she was ready to take on the world with Unit-02.  
他记得她第一次在航空母舰上遇见他时就是穿着这件衣服。在他的脑海中，背景是战斗机被弹射起飞的场景，那时明日香骄傲地站在飞行甲板上，脸上带着坚定的表情告诉他，她已经准备好与二号机一起征服世界。

Oh, Asuka looked down on him, as though he was a commoner coming face-to-face with a medieval potentate with the billowing skirt of her sundress threatening to expose her thighs and underwear (screaming SEX in flashing neon lights).  
哦，明日香俯视着他，仿佛他是一个平民突然面对着一位中世纪的君主，她那飘逸的太阳裙摆似乎随时可能露出她的大腿和内裤（闪烁的霓虹灯仿佛在尖叫着‘性’）。

When the Angel made an assault against the naval fleet, he tried to make his best impression possible as they dived in and fought the Angel underwater, even as he wore her spare plugsuit. How they managed to fish the damned thing out of the water and onto the flight deck, tried to kill that sea monster, but in the end it only took a pair of ancient battleships to destroy the Angel.  
当使徒对海军舰队发起攻击时，他尽力在他们潜入水中与使徒战斗时留下最好的印象，尽管他穿着她的备用插入栓服。他们是如何设法将那该死的东西从水中捞到飞行甲板上的，试图杀死那海怪，但最终却只靠两艘古老的战舰摧毁了使徒。

Since then Shinji found himself in constant conflict with Asuka, even as the situation they were into stuck them together out of necessity, and they had to come into the fight side-to-side.  
自那以后，真嗣发现自己与明日香总是矛盾不断，尽管他们所处的境况迫使他们不得不相互依靠，必须并肩作战。

Funny, Toji once called them the 'married couple', and even though both of them tried to deny it, the label was firmly stuck on them as they quarreled. He could remember trying to kiss her once, and then tried again at Asuka's urging, but now Shinji wondered how he could talk to her, as she was awake at this moment.  
有趣的是，曾经有一次，阿薰称他们为‘夫妻档’，尽管两人都试图否认，但这个标签却牢牢地贴在了他们身上，因为他们总是争吵不休。他记得曾试图吻她一次，后来在明日香的怂恿下又试了一次，但现在真嗣想知道，此刻她醒着，他该如何与她交谈。

The bad news for her is that she's going home, never to return, and never to pilot again. He tried to imagine how her new life would be like after she spent much of her lifetime to become the chosen pilot of Unit-02, only she couldn't do anymore in the end. Furthermore, after all of her suffering, how she could accept the fact that Kaworu was now the new pilot of her Eva?  
对她来说，坏消息是她即将回家，再也不会回来，也再也不能驾驶 EVA 了。他试图想象，在她花费了大部分生命成为二号机的指定驾驶员之后，她的新生活会是什么样子，最终她却无法再继续下去了。更甚的是，在她经历了那么多痛苦之后，她如何能接受渚薰现在成为她 EVA 的新驾驶员这一事实呢？

The thought made Shinji groan as he placed the sundress into the bag. He hoped she wouldn't deck Kaworu with a straight punch.  
这个念头让真嗣叹了口气，他将那条太阳裙放入包中。他希望她不会一拳直击向渚薰。

---

In curiosity and as part of his post-breakfast morning walk, Kaworu Nagisa ventured out from NERV HQ to visit a garden hidden behind the pine trees that dotted the Geofront's landscape. He once saw a glimpse of this garden on his way up to the ruins of Tokyo-3, and now as he entered through its gate for the first time, right before his eyes there were beds of colorful flowers, manicured lawns, shaped hedges, water fountains, and in the middle of all of this lush greenery was a gazebo, flanked by a pair of marble columns and surrounded by palms.  
出于好奇，以及早餐后的晨间散步，渚薰离开了 NERV 总部，前往隐藏在松树林后的花园。他曾在前往第三新东京市废墟的路上瞥见过这个花园，如今第一次推开园门，眼前是五彩缤纷的花坛、修剪整齐的草坪、造型各异的灌木、喷泉，而在这一片郁郁葱葱的绿意中央，是一座被一对大理石柱子环绕的凉亭，四周环绕着棕榈树。

"I didn't know this place existed," Kaworu whispered in awe, as he walked around. "Beautiful."  
“我之前竟不知道这个地方的存在，”渚薰惊叹着低语，漫步其中，“真是美极了。”

Still, there was a reason for this garden to exist: like city parks it clearly served to provide a warm and vibrant contrast to the stark, cold and sterile science that occurred beneath the ground. Kaworu also guessed that given the stressful nature of scientific work, anyone can take a break and come here to literally smell the flowers.  
尽管如此，这个花园的存在是有其原因的：就像城市公园一样，它显然是为了在地下那冰冷、严酷且无菌的科学环境之外，提供一个温暖而充满活力的对比。碇真嗣也猜测，考虑到科学工作的压力性质，任何人都可以在这里稍作休息，实实在在地闻闻花香。

Out of several flowers present in full bloom, one bed of roses interested him with their blazing pure whiteness, and he walked up and knelt down to pick several, careful not to be pricked by the thorns. He intended this bouquet to be given to Rei as a gift.  
在盛开的众多花卉中，一片纯白如火的玫瑰引起了他的兴趣，他走近并跪下，小心翼翼地采摘了几朵，避免被刺扎到。他打算将这束花作为礼物送给绫波零。

_Maybe she would like these,_ he thought, gazing at the roses in his grasp as he stood up.  
也许她会喜欢这些，他想，站起身来，凝视着手中握着的玫瑰。

In Doctor Odani's office, after the reluctant nurses placed Asuka onto the examination table and then left, Natsumi said, "You still have some of the sedatives in your system, which you'll have to wait for a least a few hours more before their effects dissipate."  
在小谷医生的办公室里，不情愿的护士们将明日香放在检查台上，然后离开后，夏美说道：“你体内还有一些镇静剂，至少还需要几个小时才能完全消退。”

Asuka nodded quietly. "What then?" she asked as Natsumi went through the motions of checking her pulse and respiration with a stethoscope on several places of the girl's chest.  
明日香静静地点了点头。“然后呢？”她问道，夏美正用听诊器检查她的脉搏和呼吸，在女孩胸部的几个部位进行操作。

"By that time, you'll be getting your release papers approved before you're on your way."  
“到那时，你会先拿到出院文件，然后就可以离开了。”

"I see," Asuka said resignedly. "Looks like I'm done in here, isn't it?"  
"我明白了，" 明日香无奈地说道，"看来我在这里已经无能为力了，不是吗？"

Natsumi set her stethoscope aside and scribbled her findings on a clipboard. "I can't be the judge of that," she replied, now taking out a penlight from her chest pocket, flicking it on. "However, I believe that there's more to life than a single ruling passion. Okay, can you leave your eyes open so that I can see them?"  
夏美将听诊器放在一旁，在剪贴板上草草记录下她的发现。"我无法对此做出判断，"她回答道，从胸前的口袋里拿出一支笔灯，打开开关。"然而，我相信生活中还有比单一热情更重要的东西。好了，你能睁开眼睛让我看看吗？"

Asuka sat still as Natsumi played the light beam over her blue pupils.  
明日香静静地坐着，任由夏美用光束在她蓝色的瞳孔上扫过。

"You're a bit dazed after several days in the bed," Natsumi spoke, putting back the penlight. "Try to do some eye exercises for a couple of minutes, and then just focus on that poster right there. Read the letters one by one with one open eye and the other covered, and then repeat with the opposite eye," she added, pointing out at the eye chart a few meters away.  
"你在床上躺了几天，有点恍惚，"夏美说着，把笔灯放回原处。"试着做几分钟的眼部运动，然后就盯着那张海报看。用一只眼睛逐个字母地读，另一只眼睛闭上，然后再换另一只眼睛重复，"她补充道，指着几米外的视力表。

As instructed, Asuka began reading out the letters on the chart, going far enough to the midway point, before repeating the same process with the other eye. From this, Natsumi wrote down Asuka's overall visual condition, and nodded approvingly.  
按照指示，明日香开始读视力表上的字母，一直读到中间位置，然后换另一只眼睛重复同样的步骤。据此，夏美记录下了明日香的整体视力状况，并赞许地点了点头。

"Not bad, considering you're just out of the bed," she remarked.  
"不错了，考虑到你刚下床，"她评论道。

"Thanks," Asuka said. “谢谢，”明日香说道。

In the next thirty minutes Asuka compliantly went through her full examination, including a flex test, a blood sample, an ear examination, mouth check, and so on. The girl never said a word throughout the process, as she stoically knew that her days here were over; the prospects of riding Unit-02 again were becoming remote to her as the time passed, to be replaced by growing thoughts of life outside this world.  
接下来的三十分钟里，明日香顺从地完成了全面检查，包括柔韧性测试、血液采样、耳部检查、口腔检查等等。整个过程中，她一言不发，因为她坚忍地知道，自己在这里的日子即将结束；随着时间的推移，再次驾驶二号机的可能性越来越渺茫，取而代之的是对外面世界生活的日益向往。

She would soon wake up to mornings not worrying about the next mission, waiting for a passing Angel to slay, nor constantly doubting her sync ratio. She would be _normal_.  
她很快就会迎来不再为下一次任务担忧的早晨，不再等待路过的使徒来消灭，也不再时刻怀疑自己的同步率。她将回归正常。

With much of Asuka's luggage on a flatbed cart, and sober with enough caffeine, calories and aspirin in their systems, Misato and Shinji stood at the parking lot, waiting for the agent to arrive, when they saw the car coming in, made a sharp turn and parked to a full stop. Misato recognized it as a sleek Audi S4 model sedan, possessing full-performance aftermarket options, gloss black paint, and well-armored. As this was a quick VIP machine for NERV top brass, including Commander Ikari, Misato believed that this particular car included some serious just-in-case firepower hidden beneath.  
在大部分明日香的行李被放在平板推车上，且两人体内充斥着足够的咖啡因、卡路里和阿司匹林后，美里和真嗣站在停车场，等待代理人的到来。当他们看到一辆车疾驰而来，一个急转弯稳稳停下时，美里认出这是一辆流线型的奥迪 S4 轿车，配备了全性能的改装选项，光泽黑漆，且装甲坚固。由于这是 NERV 高层，包括碇司令的快速 VIP 座驾，美里相信这辆车下隐藏着一些紧急情况下的重型火力。

Misato also recognized the driver as he stepped out into the morning sun: Captain Tsutomo Kanzaki, the Section Two guy dressed in a three-piece suit. He walked around the Audi, stood before Misato and saluted smartly.  
美里也认出了从车里走出来沐浴在晨光中的司机：二课的官长善冢宽，身穿三件套西装。他绕过奥迪，站在美里面前，利落地敬了个礼。

"Good morning, ma'am," Kanzaki greeted.  
“早上好，女士，”宽问候道。

"Good morning," Misato answered, returning the agent's salute. With unspoken agreement, Misato, Shinji and Tsutomo began loading their parcels into the trunk, and once done, they boarded the Audi and sped out of the parking lot.  
"早上好，" 美里回答道，回敬了特工的敬礼。无需言语，美里、真嗣和堤摩开始将包裹装入后备箱，完成后，他们登上奥迪车，疾驰离开停车场。

"Why use this one?" Misato asked Tsutomo, referring to the car. In the backseat and with the seatbelt on, Shinji was in his usual quiet self with the SDAT earphones plugged.  
"为什么要用这辆车？" 美里问堤摩，指的是这辆车。在后座系好安全带，真嗣一如既往地安静，SDAT 耳机插在耳朵里。

"Knowing what happened before, the Sub-Commander and my boss aren't going to take any chances," he replied. "By the way, once we have her with us, as planned we'll be joined by a few others in two Pajeros and two Humvees, and some air support."  
"鉴于之前发生的事情，副司令和我的上司不会冒险，" 他回答道。"顺便说一下，按照计划，一旦我们带上她，将会有两辆帕杰罗和两辆悍马以及一些空中支援加入我们。

"I see. Why we need so many escorts with the fact that we're only accompanying a girl?"  
"我明白了。既然我们只是护送一个小女孩，为什么需要这么多护卫？"

"This time," Tsutomo answered, "my boss must be having some sort of a sixth sense, thinking there could be some trouble coming up, after he got too much flack over his handling of the search operations for that Langley girl, some intel screw-ups, the Bakelite sabotage yesterday, and so on. He doesn't want to mess his retirement plans with yet another SNAFU, which means today he has security beefed up even with this supposed ferry job."  
"这次，" 筒友回答道，"我的老板大概是有了某种第六感，觉得可能会有麻烦。自从他在寻找兰利女孩的搜索行动中受到太多指责，情报失误，昨天的酚醛塑料破坏事件等等之后，他不想再让自己的退休计划因为又一个混乱局面而泡汤。这意味着今天即使是这种看似简单的渡船任务，他也加强了安保。"

Instinctively, Misato reached into the folds of her uniform, and beneath it felt the reassuring heft of her HK USP service pistol nestled in her Galco Miami Classic harness. Tsutomo noticed her checking the gun and said, "No problem about us packing iron, ma'am, should we get in trouble. I'm carrying a Glock, and on the backseat there's a pair of UMP45s and spare mags, and vests." He meant there were two submachine guns, ammo and bullet-proof vests, which for Misato were better than nothing.  
下意识地，美里伸手探入制服的褶皱中，在下面感受到了她那把 HK USP 服务手枪在 Galco 迈阿密经典枪套中令人安心的重量。筒友注意到她在检查枪械，便说："我们带枪没问题，女士，万一遇到麻烦。我带了一把格洛克，后座上有两把 UMP45 冲锋枪和备用弹匣，还有防弹衣。" 他指的是两把冲锋枪、弹药和防弹衣，对美里来说，总比没有好。

"Hmmm, seems that they've been spared from the budget chopping block," Misato commented. She could see that they were now approaching a gate leading to a tunnel for the linear car train station.  
"“嗯，看来他们逃过了预算削减的刀刃，”美里评论道。她可以看到他们现在正接近一个通往磁悬浮列车车站隧道的入口。”

"Those guns are only for special needs like this car," Tsutomo said, "but we're doing everything we could after the problem with the security budget, and so my boss said that we had to improvise, train hard, or make do with anything we have in the inventory. He's also worried that anything less could be more than just having the danger of Al-Qaeda or the International Resistance dropping in with a Christmas gift. Most people look upon NERV as a military organization, and how could you call it a military organization if it doesn't have any _guns?_"  
"“这些枪支只在这种特殊情况下使用，”筒友说，“但在安全预算出现问题后，我们尽了一切努力，所以我的上司说我们必须即兴发挥，刻苦训练，或者利用库存中的任何东西。他还担心，如果做得不够，可能会不仅仅是面临基地组织或国际抵抗组织送来的圣诞礼物那样的危险。大多数人认为 NERV 是一个军事组织，如果没有枪支，你怎么能称之为军事组织呢？”

Stopping by the guardhouse at the gate, Tsutomo lowered the window and showed his ID to the guard, who nodded back and lowered the crash barrier, before the Audi rolled away into the tunnel.  
"在入口处的警卫室停下，筒友摇下车窗，向警卫出示了身份证，警卫点头回应并降下了防撞栏杆，随后奥迪车驶入了隧道。”

"That has changed, however," Tsutomo continued. "Two weeks ago my boss pleaded to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki about purchasing some equipment on that tight budget, and promised that he could find a ready and legit supplier on the cheap. However, for good reason we didn't let the Commander in the scheme."  
"然而，情况已经变了，"筒友继续说道。"两周前，我的上司向副司令官冬月恳求在紧张的预算中购买一些设备，并承诺他能找到一个既便宜又合法的供应商。但由于某些原因，我们没有让指挥官参与这个计划。"

"How did you know?" Misato asked, as the car parked into its place on the linear train. "I thought there's almost no budget for security."  
"你怎么知道的？"美里问道，此时汽车停在了磁悬浮列车站。"我以为安全方面的预算几乎为零。"

"No, the Sub-Commander did otherwise with the budget surplus by taking advantage of the so-called 'intelligence fund', using some accounting loopholes, and ordering for us the equipment ASAP," Tsutomo said as he pulled up the hand brake. "A week later I was on the purchasing team, finding dealers in America. We were lucky that I had old friends working in the defense industry, and we managed to clinch a deal with the lowest bidders. More guns and gear for us, except that they're all surplus, because the Pentagon's switching its troops over to new equipment. Well, later on we're due to get a shipment of that from America, to be picked up at Atsugi and delivered by rail. It's more secure there than at the airport near here." Atsugi was home to a sizable US naval air station, currently hosting squadrons of UN Emergency Forces aircraft.  
“不，副指挥官另辟蹊径，利用所谓的‘情报基金’，钻了一些会计漏洞，并催促我们尽快订购装备。”筒友说着拉起了手刹。“一周后，我加入了采购团队，在美国寻找经销商。幸运的是，我在国防工业有老朋友，我们设法与最低报价者达成了交易。我们得到了更多的枪支和装备，只不过这些都是过剩物资，因为五角大楼正在将其部队转移到新装备上。嗯，之后我们预计会从美国运来一批货物，将在厚木基地接收并通过铁路运输。那里比附近的机场更安全。”厚木基地是美国海军航空站的重要驻地，目前驻扎着联合国紧急部队的中队。

They now felt the jolt as the tire locks engaged to hold the Audi in place, and the linear train began moving downward. Tsutomo managed a small sigh.  
他们现在感受到了轮胎锁啮合的震动，将奥迪固定在原位，而线性列车开始向下移动。筒友勉强叹了口气。

"So tomorrow we'll be carrying more bang for the buck, and that's all," he said. "'Fifty percent of something's better than a hundred percent of nothing', as I quote that Chinese guy from that drift race movie. I tell you, ma'am, no soldier here worth his salt would be standing around wearing only standard-issue dress khakis and a peashooter once the shit hits the fan."  
"所以明天我们会更有价值，这就是全部，"他说。"五十个百分点的有总比一百个百分点的无好'，我引用那部漂移赛车电影里的那个中国人。我跟您说，女士，一旦情况不妙，这里没有一个值得尊敬的士兵会只穿着标准配发的卡其裤和一把小手枪站在那儿。"

Asuka, in a wheelchair this time, was about to be returned back to her room when she requested to Takako Chigusa, who was pushing her from behind, that she be brought to Rei. The young nurse nodded and they went into Rei's room.  
这次坐在轮椅上的明日香，在被送回房间之前，向推着她的千草贵子请求带她去见绫波。年轻的护士点了点头，他们便进入了绫波的房间。

Once Takako left them alone, the blue-haired girl set aside the book she was reading and asked, "What is it, Pilot Soryu?"  
千草一离开，蓝发女孩放下手中的书，问道："怎么了，惣流·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员？"

"Just wanted to have a little chat," Asuka said. "Call me Asuka instead. I feel better that way, and besides I'm a _civilian_ today, not an Evangelion pilot."  
"只是想随便聊聊，" 明日香说道。"叫我明日香就好。这样我感觉更自在，而且今天我不是 EVA 驾驶员，只是个平民。"

Inwardly, Rei noted the unusual change in Asuka's behavior, especially the absence of her usual standoffish behavior and disdain, now replaced by apathy and sobriety. "I see," she answered, nodding. "What do you wish to talk about?"  
内心深处，绫波注意到了明日香行为上的不寻常变化，尤其是她平时那种疏离和蔑视的态度消失了，取而代之的是冷漠和清醒。"我明白了，"她点头回答。"你想谈些什么？"

"Well, I have a thought today, like, uh, having a change of heart about you because I had this dream where I met this guy and I talked to him. Said everything about me and you, and told me that I have to live."  
"嗯，我今天有个想法，就像是，呃，对你有了新的看法，因为我做了个梦，梦里遇到了一个男人，我和他聊了很多。说了关于我和你的所有事情，他还告诉我必须活下去。"

Asuka glanced briefly at her bandaged wrists, before she returned her attention to Rei.  
明日香瞥了一眼她包扎着绷带的手腕，随后又将注意力转回到绫波身上。

"I'm sorry for everything I did against you," she apologized.  
“对于我对你所做的一切，我很抱歉，”她道歉道。

"Why?" Rei asked. “为什么？”绫波问道。

"Instead of thanking you for saving me, I was angry. In the elevator I also foolishly thought you were wrong about opening my heart to Eva that I slapped you."  
"非但没有感谢你救了我，我还生气了。在电梯里我还愚蠢地认为你错在向 Eva 敞开心扉，于是打了你。"

Rei remembered that elevator spat between them, and Asuka calling her Eva a doll.  
丽记得那次电梯里的争吵，以及明日香称她为 Eva 的玩偶。

"Now you're right," Asuka said, shaking her head, "but it's too late. I'd rather do something else than waste too much of my time here. I spent nearly a lifetime after being selected, trained for this, ate, drank, slept and lived to become a pilot… However, today, I'm going home, and maybe there I'll try to become normal and forget that I was once here. Go back to school, be more open and find new friends, land a job..."  
"现在你对了，"明日香摇着头说，"但已经太迟了。我宁愿做点别的，也不想在这里浪费太多时间。在被选中后，我几乎花了一辈子的时间训练，吃喝拉撒睡，全是为了成为一名驾驶员……然而，今天，我要回家了，也许在那里我会尝试变得正常，忘记我曾经在这里的一切。回到学校，更加开放，结交新朋友，找份工作……"

Rei said nothing, as Asuka sighed wearily.  
丽没有说话，明日香疲惫地叹了口气。

"I'm useless here," Asuka despaired, "as I can't move that Eva anymore, and I'm tired."  
“我在这里毫无用处，”明日香绝望地说，“我再也无法移动那台 EVA 了，而且我也累了。”

"Though I am still alive, I am no different from you, as I have also lost my purpose."  
“尽管我还活着，但我与你并无不同，因为我同样失去了我的目标。”

The redhead was wide-eyed. "What?"  
红发女孩瞪大了眼睛。“什么？”

"Unit Zero is gone, so I tried to do my best to be as useful as possible, but after the compatibility test with Unit One, it has become clear that I am no longer able to pilot."  
“零号机消失了，所以我尽力做到最有用，但在与初号机进行适配测试后，很明显我已无法再驾驶。”

"But why you're still here, and for what?" Asuka asked, scratching her head.  
"“但为什么你还在这儿，为了什么？”明日香挠着头问道。”

"The Commander wants me alive, and yet he has never told me why. He has yet to visit me here."  
"指挥官要我活着，却从未告诉我原因。他至今未曾来此探望我。"

"Funny, you're jobless just like me. That leaves out Invincible Shinji."  
"有趣，你和我一样失业了。这样一来，‘无敌的真嗣’也就不复存在了。"

"You are mistaken," Rei said. "There is already another who has replaced you. He is now the pilot of Unit Two."  
"你误会了，"绫波说，"已经有另一个人取代了你。他现在是二号机的驾驶员。"

Bowled over, Asuka asked, "Who's piloting it this time?"  
被吓了一跳的明日香问道：“这次是谁在驾驶它？”

Rei didn't answer, but instead stared far at the direction of the door. Noticing this, Asuka turned her wheelchair around to find Kaworu Nagisa standing at the doorway with a fresh bouquet of white roses. The young man smiled weakly.  
绫波没有回答，而是远远地盯着门的方向。注意到这一点，明日香转动轮椅，发现渚薰正站在门口，手里拿着一束新鲜的白色玫瑰。年轻人虚弱地笑了笑。

"Good morning, Rei," he greeted, "and I'm pleased to see you again, Asuka."  
“早上好，绫波，”他打招呼道，“也很高兴再次见到你，明日香。”

This morning and on her way down to the Stockade, Maya Ibuki looked glum after yesterday's testing SNAFU, causing her much distress thereafter and forcing her to take leave early, and several days before that, her boss Ritsuko Akagi was sent to jail for an embezzlement charge she didn't believe in. The only consolation for her so far was having Doctor Natsumi Odani as her new boss, and fortunately Odani was kind enough to explain her reasons and was willing to work with her.  
今早，在前往禁闭室的路上，真希波·真理·伊吹显得郁郁寡欢。昨日的测试混乱让她倍感困扰，不得不提前请假休息，而就在前几天，她的上司赤木律子因一桩她不相信的挪用公款罪名被送进了监狱。目前唯一的安慰是有了新上司——大谷夏美博士，幸运的是，夏美博士不仅向她解释了原因，还愿意与她合作。

About two days ago, Odani told her about the unusual data coming from Kaworu Nagisa after they put him through a compatibility test with Unit-02, and gave the data to her for analysis. In those two days of combing through the figures, Maya found out that Kaworu can adjust his sync rate to any level with little difficulty and greater stability.  
大约两天前，夏美博士向她透露了来自渚薰在与二号机进行适配测试后产生的异常数据，并将这些数据交给她进行分析。经过两天的仔细梳理，真希波发现渚薰能够轻松且稳定地将同步率调整到任意水平。

Today, Maya received a memo from the top, in which she was now allowed to visit Doctor Akagi on matters regarding the MAGI and the Evas. But the MAGI supercomputers were doing fine as usual, and in its operational history the microbial Angel attack was the sole serious intrusion against the system.  
今天，真希波收到了来自高层的备忘录，允许她因 MAGI 系统和 EVA 相关事宜探访赤木律子博士。但 MAGI 超级计算机一如既往地运行良好，在其操作历史上，微生物型使徒攻击是唯一一次对系统的严重入侵。

It was only the Evas, especially Unit-01, that were still difficult and unpredictable to work with. Before yesterday's compatibility test, she wanted to voice her misgivings about the possibility of that Eva rejecting Rei, but Commander Ikari was a difficult, fearsome person to placate, like Captain Ahab trying to hunt down that mythical white whale. Only later after debriefing did Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki told her that he even tried to stop him.  
只有 EVA，特别是初号机，仍然难以驾驭且不可预测。在昨天的同步测试之前，她本想表达对这台 EVA 可能拒绝绫波的担忧，但碇司令是个难以安抚、令人畏惧的人物，就像亚哈船长追捕那只神话中的白鲸一样。直到事后汇报时，副司令冬月才告诉她，他甚至试图阻止过他。

All told and after a string of mishaps, Maya was deeply concerned that the Commander may be leading them all to uncertainty.  
总的来说，在一连串的意外之后，真嗣深感担忧，司令可能正带领他们走向未知的境地。

In the Stockade office, which all visitors had to pass through after their credentials were established, Maya showed her ID card to the seated sentry and explained about the purpose of her visit.  
在拘留所办公室，所有访客在验证身份后都必须经过这里，真嗣向坐着的哨兵出示了她的身份证，并说明了来访的目的。

"I'm here to see Doctor Akagi," she said, showing the printout of the memo, complete with Commander Ikari's signature and authentication barcode. "I just wanted to report to her about the current status of the MAGI," she added, laying a sheaf of reports onto the sentry's desk.  
"我来见赤木博士，"她说着，展示了那张带有碇司令签名和认证条形码的备忘录打印件。"我只是想向她报告 MAGI 的当前状态，"她补充道，将一叠报告放在哨兵的桌子上。

The sentry said nothing, as he gave her a clipboard, where she wrote the details of her visit, before handing it back to the man. The sentry then gestured to her to pass through a metal detector, followed him down into the holding cells, clearing two steel doors with a keycard, before he tapped on the door of Ritsuko's cell and said, "Doctor, you have a visitor today."  
哨兵一言不发，递给她一个剪贴板，她在上面填写了访问细节，然后交还给他。哨兵随后示意她通过金属探测器，跟着他下到拘留室，用钥匙卡刷开两扇钢门，最后他敲了敲赤木的牢门说："博士，今天你有访客。"

"Who?" Ritsuko asked. "谁？"赤木问。

"It's Lieutenant Ibuki," he answered.  
"是伊吹中尉，"他回答道。

Ritsuko gave out a sigh of relief. "Okay, thanks. Just let her in."  
律子松了一口气，"好的，谢谢。让她进来吧。"

The sentry unlocked the cell door with his passcode on the keypad, then swiped with another keycard, and swung it open. Maya entered, and thanked the sentry, but warned her in return, "You got only half an hour in there. Call me when you're finished."  
哨兵用他的密码在键盘上解锁了牢房门，然后用另一张钥匙卡刷了一下，将门打开。玛雅进入后，向哨兵道谢，并提醒她："你只有半小时时间。结束后给我打电话。"

In the fluorescent light Maya was astonished at the changes in her boss' appearance: Ritsuko looked gaunt, her once dyed-blonde hair faded into its original chestnut brown, and she was wearing baggy prisoner's coveralls. She was sitting on her cot, and facing her was an empty folding chair. Also on the cot were several paperbacks; a dog-eared copy of _Contact_ was laid open, halfway through reading Ellie Arroway's odyssey.  
在荧光灯下，真嗣惊讶地发现她的上司外表发生了巨大变化：律子看起来憔悴不堪，曾经染成金色的头发褪色成了原本的栗棕色，身上穿着宽松的囚服。她坐在床铺上，对面是一把空折叠椅。床铺上还散落着几本平装书；一本翻得破旧的《接触》摊开着，正好翻到埃莉·阿罗约的奥德赛之旅的中段。

"Hi," Ritsuko said with a small smile as she watched her protégé sit down. "I'm sorry if I look like this crappy."  
"嗨，"律子带着一丝微笑说道，看着她的徒弟坐下。"如果我看起来这么糟糕，我很抱歉。"

"It's okay, ma'am," Maya answered. "Are you eating well?"  
"没关系，女士，"真嗣回答。"你吃得还好吗？"

"Don't worry about me. I have three square meals a day, plus a shower. You have anything new?"  
"别担心我。我一日三餐不缺，还有淋浴。你有什么新鲜事吗？"

"I have these," Maya said, showing the progress reports before placing them onto the cot. Ritsuko took one of them off the top and read, skimming through the printouts before reaching for another folder. The process continued until she opened a folder concerning the Fifth Children.  
"我有这些，" 玛雅说着，展示了进度报告，然后将它们放在床上。律子从最上面拿起一份，阅读着，快速浏览打印件，然后伸手去拿另一个文件夹。这个过程一直持续到她打开一个关于第五适格者的文件夹。

"That's the new pilot of Unit Two," Maya helpfully said.  
"那是二号机的新的驾驶员，" 玛雅热心地说道。

"Strange," Ritsuko remarked, squinting twice to make sure her eyes didn't fool her. "When did he arrive?" she asked, but she gestured to Maya with an index finger across her lips to keep their voices down.  
"奇怪，" 律子说道，眯起眼睛再三确认不是自己的错觉。"他什么时候到的？" 她问道，同时用食指在唇边向摩耶示意保持安静。

"About three days ago. He's from Germany," Maya said almost quietly.  
"大约三天前。他是从德国来的，" 摩耶几乎轻声地说道。

Ritsuko frowned. "Who sent him here?"  
律子皱起眉头。"谁派他来的？

"I don't know, except he's Asuka's replacement. Maybe only the Commander knows."  
"我不知道，只知道他是明日香的替补。可能只有司令知道。"

"Must be the Committee," Ritsuko said. "Seems they're helping us out near the end, but the timing's too right, and too convenient."  
"肯定是委员会，" 律子说。"看来他们在最后关头帮了我们一把，但这个时机太巧合，也太方便了。"

"Ma'am, what do you mean?" Maya asked.  
"女士，您是什么意思？" 真希波问。"

Ritsuko shrugged. "Unit Zero is dead, and the First Children is nothing but a replacement. And then you have the Second Children literally out of action after she nearly got her brains fried. This leaves the Third, Shinji, and Unit One to remain. And suddenly we have this newcomer with an ostensibly wonderful skill set. Anyway, what happened yesterday? There seemed to be a ruckus up there."  
律子耸了耸肩。“零号机已经报废，初号机也不过是替代品。而二号机在绫波几乎脑死亡后也实质上无法行动了。这样一来，只剩下三号机、真嗣和初号机。突然间，又来了个看似技能出众的新人。话说回来，昨天到底发生了什么？上面似乎闹得沸沸扬扬。”

"The Commander tried to have Rei accomplish a compatibility test with Unit One," Maya said, and explained to Ritsuko about yesterday's failed test.  
“司令试图让绫波与初号机进行适配测试，”玛雅说道，并向律子解释了昨天测试失败的情况。

"That hard-headed sonofabitch," Ritsuko muttered at the end of Maya's narrative. "Mind if I could smoke?" she asked, pulling out a pack of Mild Seven cigarettes and a disposable lighter. Maya nodded; the young woman knew that cigarettes, despite being noxious, were as necessary to Ritsuko as to a baby needing a pacifier.  
“那个顽固的老混蛋，”听完玛雅的叙述后，律子低声咒骂道。“介意我抽根烟吗？”她问着，掏出一包柔和七星香烟和一个一次性打火机。玛雅点点头；她知道，尽管香烟有害，但对律子来说，它们就像婴儿需要安抚奶嘴一样不可或缺。

Ritsuko lit up one stick and puffed. Her lips blew out a stream of spent tobacco before she said, "I suppose he's too eager to restart the Dummy Plug project. And why not rebuild the damned thing, especially when you have a new boy with an exceptional sync rate, and use his data in the rebuild?"  
律子点燃了一根烟，深深吸了一口。她的嘴唇吐出一缕消散的烟雾，随后说道：“我想他是太急于重启 Dummy Plug 项目了。为什么不重建那该死的东西呢，特别是当你有了一个同步率异常出色的新男孩，并可以用他的数据来重建？”

"It's not going to happen," Maya answered. "From what I heard, the Commander has shut down the project. It wasn't worth risking for because it made too much trouble."  
“这不会发生的，”玛雅回答，“据我所知，司令已经关闭了这个项目。不值得为此冒险，因为它带来了太多麻烦。”

"Good riddance," Ritsuko said sourly, her fingers tapping the ashes away from the burning stick. "Anyway, how Odani is treating you?"  
“谢天谢地，”律子酸溜溜地说，她的手指轻敲着，将烟灰弹离燃烧的烟头。“话说回来，小谷对你怎么样？”

Maya smiled. "She's okay, we're doing fine whenever she would check on me but I can manage myself even if you're stuck in here. As far as she's concerned, the Commander gave her a higher security clearance in order to access medical records, and maybe some of your files."  
玛雅笑了。“她没事，每次她来看我，我们都挺好的，即使你被困在这里，我也能照顾好自己。就她所知，司令给了她更高的安全权限，以便访问医疗记录，也许还有你的一些文件。”

Ritsuko blinked. "What?"  
律子眨了眨眼。“什么？”

But Maya shook her head. "Doctor Odani told me not to worry; all she needed was the necessary data, and judging from the login records she never touched any of your encrypted files. Her main concern is more on the medical than yours."  
但玛雅摇了摇头。“小谷医生告诉我不用担心；她只需要必要的数据，从登录记录来看，她从未碰过你的加密文件。她的主要关注点更多在于医疗方面，而不是你的。”

The older scientist sighed in relief. "What files she used, anyway?"  
老科学家松了口气。“她到底用了哪些文件？”

Maya explained about Odani's use of Rei's MRI/PET scan files yesterday while checking the girl's previous neurological condition; told her it was for comparison checks on the hippocampus section because of an anomaly caused by Unit-01 while she went haywire during the failed test.  
玛雅解释了昨天尾谷使用零的 MRI/PET 扫描文件来检查她之前的神经系统状况；告诉她这是为了对比海马体部分，因为在失败的测试中，零因初号机失控而出现了异常。

"Neither Doctor Odani nor I know what sort of information that Unit One forced into Rei's mind, but she said that there was nothing wrong with her, top to bottom, barring a concussion."  
“无论是尾谷医生还是我，都不知道初号机强行向零的脑海中灌输了什么信息，但她表示零从头到脚都没有问题，除了轻微的脑震荡。”

"I see," Ritsuko said. "She looks real healthy, sure enough to be out by the day's end."  
"我明白了，" 律子说。"她看起来很健康，肯定能在今天结束前出院。"

Maya shrugged her shoulders. "I'm not sure about this but today Rei has to attend a debriefing, along with that Nagisa boy, just to know what happened. And oh, if you wanted to know, Asuka will be going back to Germany. It's a general medical discharge with the Commander's signature on the release papers."  
玛雅耸了耸肩。"我不太确定，但今天零和那个叫渚的男孩得参加一次汇报会，了解一下发生了什么。哦，如果你想了解的话，明日香要回德国了。这是一份由指挥官签字的常规医疗退役文件。"

Ritsuko shook her head, guessing well that Asuka's time was up. "I wish her the best," she commented. "She did everything she could to become what she wanted to be."  
律子摇了摇头，心里清楚明日香的时间已经到了。"我祝她一切顺利，"她评论道。"她尽了全力去成为她想成为的人。"

While Fallout Boy on his SDAT blared into his ears, Shinji recalled Asuka's kiss.  
当 SDAT 播放器里的 Fallout Boy 震耳欲聋地传入耳中，真嗣回想起明日香的吻。

No, really, her kiss was forever branded into his brain, with all five senses able to record that moment; he could still remember the chocolate flavor and smell of her mouth, eyes widened in shock and pleasure, the pop music from the radio, and the softness of her lips.  
不，真的，她的吻永远烙印在他的脑海里，五感都能记录那一刻；他仍能记得她口中巧克力的味道和气息，震惊与愉悦中睁大的双眼，收音机里的流行音乐，以及她唇瓣的柔软。

It was a rare prize that can only be obtained by fortunate circumstances.  
这是一份难得的奖赏，只能由幸运的境遇获得。

Boys in his school desired her, the sexiest bomb ever to walk before their gaze, but whether for better or for worse, Shinji was the only one to kiss Asuka.  
他学校的男生们都渴望她，她是他们眼前走过的最性感的炸弹，但无论是好是坏，真嗣是唯一一个吻过明日香的人。

_Amazing to be that lucky_, Shinji thought as he watched the bucolic scenery whiz by while the linear train was descending to the Headquarters station below. He still felt sleepy from his hangover, the plush rear seat and the air-conditioning of the car made it all too comfortable to doze in, but the music piped into his ears and thoughts of her kept him awake.  
真嗣觉得自己真是幸运至极，他望着窗外飞驰而过的田园风光，线性列车正向总部站下降。宿醉让他仍感到困倦，豪华的后座和车内的空调让人昏昏欲睡，但耳机里的音乐和她在他脑海中的身影让他保持清醒。

He still wondered what to say to Asuka. That alone was an agonizing problem, as he was looking for a good reason to speak his mind out, and questions he wanted to ask.  
他仍在思考该对明日香说些什么。这本身就是一个令人痛苦的问题，因为他正在寻找一个合适的理由来表达自己的心声，以及他想问的问题。

The young man breathed in and out, making up his mind, practicing the lines he would say to her. He imagined himself facing her, not sure of what mood she would be in:  
年轻人深呼吸，下定决心，练习着要对她说的话。他想象着自己面对她，不确定她会是怎样的心情：

_Hi, Asuka. I'm glad you're back.  
嗨，明日香。很高兴你回来了。  
Asuka… Are you okay? I wish you're not angry with me this time. Please forgive me.  
明日香……你还好吗？我希望这次你别生我的气。请原谅我。  
Hello, Asuka. I came here today because you woke up.  
你好，明日香。我今天来这里是因为你醒了。  
Asuka, I have come here in peace.  
明日香，我是带着和平的意愿来到这里的。_

Shinji was running out of ideas, so he pulled out the earphones and asked Misato, who was on the front seat, in mid-conversation with Kanzaki. "I'm not sure what to say to her," he said, "so I was wondering what Asuka's feelings at the moment would be."  
真嗣想不出什么主意，于是他拿出耳机，向坐在前排正与神崎交谈的美里问道：“我不确定该对她说什么，”他说，“所以我想知道明日香现在的心情会是什么样的。”

Misato answered, "I have the same thoughts, too. Just greet her a good morning as if we're back home and she wakes up and asks you to make her some breakfast."  
美里回答道：“我也有同样的想法。就像我们在家一样，她醒来后向你问早安，并让你给她做早餐。”

"Ah, okay," Shinji agreed, before he posed to himself this one question: does he truly love Asuka? The young man sighed. _I'm not sure._  
“啊，好的，”真嗣同意了，然后他对自己提出了一个问题：他真的爱明日香吗？年轻人叹了口气。我不确定。

Asuka finally came to gaze at the new pilot of her Eva Unit-02: gray hair springing from his head in all directions, slim, pale complexion, his seemingly hypnotic red pupils, and an amiable, confident personality. She was speechless.  
明日香终于注视着她二号机的新驾驶员：灰色的头发乱糟糟地竖立着，身材瘦削，肤色苍白，那双看似催眠的红色瞳孔，以及一个友好而自信的性格。她无言以对。

As he placed the fresh white roses carefully in a vase on a bedside table, Kaworu was an epitome of perfection, even if he really smelled of soap instead of fragrant wood in Asuka's first encounter with him. In another dimension, she thought, Kaworu would have been a suave pop star straight out of Johnny's talent stable, adored by millions of screaming fangirls as he sang onstage, camera strobes flashing all around him.  
当他小心翼翼地将新鲜的白玫瑰插入床头柜上的花瓶时，渚薰完美得无可挑剔，尽管在明日香第一次遇见他时，他身上散发的是肥皂的清香而非木质的芬芳。在另一个世界里，她想，渚薰本该是约翰事务所直接培养出的潇洒流行巨星，站在舞台上被成千上万尖叫的粉丝所崇拜，四周闪光灯此起彼伏。

But he was one of the Children, trained to ride the Evas and fight, pummeling their gargantuan opponents into pulp, and yet they were never intended to be pop stars – just the opposite as NERV strictly prohibited any press coverage on the Children, and instead the PR office saying the lie to the media that Evas are "robots" built to stop the post-apocalyptic invaders in their tracks.  
但他也是孩子们中的一员，被训练驾驶 EVA 并战斗，将他们庞大的对手击溃成渣，然而他们从未被期望成为流行明星——恰恰相反，NERV 严格禁止任何关于孩子们的媒体报道，公关部门反而向媒体撒谎称 EVA 是“机器人”，旨在阻止末日后的入侵者。

"So… You _are_ Kaworu Nagisa," Asuka mumbled, her eyes wide in disbelief.  
“所以……你是渚薰，”明日香喃喃自语，眼中满是难以置信。

Kaworu bowed. "Yes, I'm sorry if we met _again_ in this way, but I'm glad you're almost back onto your feet."  
渚薰鞠了一躬。“是的，很抱歉我们以这种方式再次相遇，但我很高兴你几乎已经恢复了。”

Asuka gave him a little smile. "Thank you," she said. "When did you come here?"  
明日香对他微微一笑。“谢谢，”她说。“你什么时候来的？”

"Just a few days ago," Kaworu replied. "To cut the story short, I was trained for this duty, and then assigned to your Eva as the Fifth Children."  
“就在几天前，”渚薰回答。“简而言之，我接受了这项任务的训练，然后被分配到你的 Eva 作为第五适格者。”

Asuka wasn't really sure whether she could say openly that she met Kaworu in her dreams, but first things first, she was real hungry to know what went on while in coma.  
明日香并不确定自己能否坦然承认在梦中遇见了渚薰，但首要之事，她迫切想知道自己在昏迷期间发生了什么。

"How's Unit Two?" she queried as if Kaworu borrowed her Ferrari for two weeks of hard driving.  
“二号机情况如何？”她询问道，仿佛渚薰借走了她的法拉利，狂飙了两周。

"I have no problem handling her since day one," Kaworu replied. "To be honest, she's really fine while you were asleep. There's barely a scratch on that Eva, even after I got into a tangle with Unit One and pulled Rei out of the wreckage."  
“从第一天起，我就毫无问题地操控着她，”渚薰回答，“老实说，你昏迷期间她一直很好。即便在与初号机缠斗并从废墟中救出绫波后，二号机也几乎毫发无损。”

The redhead scratched her head. "And what happened to Shinji's Eva?"  
红发女孩挠了挠头。“那真嗣的 Eva 怎么了？”

Kaworu shook his head. "She rejected Rei and went out of control," he answered, before the Fifth Children explained briefly to Asuka about the failed compatibility test which landed Rei onto the hospital bed.  
渚薰摇了摇头。“她拒绝了绫波并失控了，”他回答道，随后向明日香简要解释了那次失败的兼容性测试，正是那次测试让绫波住进了医院。

"I'm sorry hearing about you going home," Kaworu said as he watched Rei quietly pick up her book and resume reading.  
“听说你要回家，我很难过，”渚薰说道，同时静静地看着绫波捡起书本继续阅读。

"It's okay, I regret nothing," Asuka answered. "I guess my job's done here, anyway. Gotta settle back to a normal life instead of worrying so much, and… "  
"没事，我毫不后悔，" 明日香回答道。"反正我的任务已经完成了。是时候回归正常生活，不再那么操心了，而且……"

All of them now heard Asuka's stomach churning. Kaworu grinned and said, "I suppose we'll order some breakfast for you."  
他们都听到了明日香肚子的咕噜声。渚薰笑了笑说："我想我们该给你点些早餐了。"

"Yeah, thanks," Asuka replied. "Frankly, I'm so damned hungry, but I'll eat in my room."  
"嗯，谢谢，" 明日香回应道。"老实说，我饿得要命，不过我会在房间里吃的。"

Kozo Fuyutsuki was in his office, behind the desk with a mug of coffee in hand, listening to music as he waited. His little stereo component was playing much of the Beatles, a taste he acquired while back in his bad old days as an unlicensed doctor on Toyohashi's boat and squatter city; when not working on a patient's case of bronchitis or a wound caused by a stray fish hook, he played cheap bootlegs of classic rock he bought from the floating market near the quay. Fuyutsuki enjoyed his music as a way to ease his intellectual difficulties.  
冬月耕造坐在办公室里，手中握着一杯咖啡，一边听着音乐一边等待。他的小音响正播放着大量披头士的歌曲，这是他在丰桥船上和棚户区做无照医生时的旧习；那时，除了治疗患者的支气管炎或鱼钩造成的伤口外，他还会在码头附近的浮动市场上购买廉价的经典摇滚盗版唱片来听。冬月将音乐作为一种缓解智力困扰的方式。

Now as he took a sip, one song had a particularly appropriate title—_Come Together_—for the situation of the moment, because the Children seemed to be rebounding back to normal, one by one, from almost close to defeat: Shinji snapped out of his depression, Rei remembering again, and today, Asuka waking up from an artificial coma.  
此刻，当他啜饮一口咖啡时，一首歌的标题格外贴切——《一起来》——因为孩子们似乎正一个接一个地从近乎失败的边缘恢复正常：真嗣摆脱了抑郁，丽重新找回了记忆，而今天，明日香从人工昏迷中苏醒过来。

On his desk, this morning's copy of the popular broadsheet _Yomiuri Daily News_ carried the headline: "Diet Approves SSDF Redeployment and Defense Budget Increase". The paper also quoted one of the parliamentary leaders and the defense minister as saying that the worsening Angel situation in Japan and potential threats from belligerent neighbors has spurred the immediate approval of new military policies to ensure national security, despite howls of protest from left-leaning groups and politicians. According to the paper, military forces have also been repositioned around the Hakone rim, with at least four heavy divisions outside the valley.  
今早他桌上的《读卖新闻》头版头条赫然写着：“国会批准自卫队重新部署及防卫预算增加”。该报还援引一位国会领导人和防卫大臣的话称，日本日益恶化的使徒局势以及来自好战邻国的潜在威胁，促使政府立即批准了新的军事政策以确保国家安全，尽管左翼团体和政治家发出了强烈的抗议声。据该报报道，军事力量也已重新部署在箱根环线上，至少有四个重型师部署在山谷外。

_Coming together, and what a sense of timing,_ he contemplated.  
时机恰到好处，他暗自思忖。

Fuyutsuki wondered if it was a coincidence that Kaworu's arrival and intervention sparked a change in here, especially to the other Children's plight, and now they were coming together.  
冬月琢磨着，是否巧合，渚薰的到来和干预在这里引发了一场变革，尤其是对其他孩子们的困境，而现在他们正汇聚一堂。

He glanced at the picture on his desk, which was one of the few surviving mementoes when he thought man has come to a new age: it showed him with Gendo and Yui, all in lab coats, the three of them with a mission to change the world.  
他瞥了一眼桌上的照片，那是他认为人类进入新时代后为数不多的幸存纪念之一：照片中他与源堂和唯并肩而立，三人皆身着实验服，肩负着改变世界的使命。

Everything seems to be coming together, and who knows what comes next? Honestly Fuyutsuki wasn't sure how things would eventually end down here, and that uncertainty left him doubting more often than being confident of expecting peace.  
一切似乎都在逐渐步入正轨，但接下来会发生什么，谁又能预料呢？说实话，冬月并不确定最终事情会如何收场，这种不确定性让他更多时候在怀疑而非自信地期待和平。

Fuyutsuki picked up the phone and dialed Misato's cellphone. He waited until the woman officer was on the line.  
冬月拿起电话，拨通了美里小姐的手机。他等待着，直到这位女军官接起电话。

"It's me, sir," she answered. "I'm on my way."  
"是我，先生，" 她回答道，"我正在路上。"

"I see. Tell Agent Kanzaki to go meet Director Hamamoto for last minute instructions. Anyway, what happened to the two of you last night? You and Shinji, I mean."  
"明白了。告诉神崎一佐去见滨本局长，听取最后的指示。对了，你们俩昨晚怎么了？你和真嗣，我是说。"

There was a long pause before Misato replied. "We had a little bonding."  
美里沉默了许久才回答。"我们稍微加深了下感情。"

"Okay, Major, it's perfectly understandable."  
"好的，少校，这完全可以理解。"

"Thanks, sir. I'll see you later."  
"谢谢，长官。回头见。"

As Fuyutsuki put the phone back onto its cradle, he wondered what Gendo was doing today and where he was, after he last saw him back at the man's office yesterday. Perhaps he was spending his time in private, probably pondering his actions in the last few days, not wanting to be disturbed.  
当冬月将电话放回底座时，他不禁思索着今天碇源堂在做什么，以及他身在何处，毕竟昨天才在对方的办公室见过他。或许他正独自度过时光，大概是在反思近几日的所作所为，不愿被打扰。

Rei was left to Doctor Odani as she called her to come for the final physical examination. Meanwhile, back in Asuka's room, as the redhead waited for her breakfast, Kaworu thought of the Second Children's new behavior, a transformation of personality; she was unlike her past persona, that of the loud, angry, haughty Asuka, out to fight to victory. Today she sounded restrained, accepting her inevitable fate to leave this place altogether with a clean conscience. He was also surprised that she wasn't hostile to the idea of him being Unit-02's new handler.  
丽被留给了医生小谷，因为她打电话让她来进行最后的体检。与此同时，在明日香的房间里，当红发女孩等待她的早餐时，薰思考着第二适格者的新行为，一种性格的转变；她已不再是过去那个大声、愤怒、傲慢的明日香，一心只为胜利而战。今天她显得克制，接受了自己注定要带着清白良心离开这个地方的命运。他还惊讶地发现，她并不反对他成为二号机的新的操纵者。

Now Nurse Chigusa came in walking, pushing a food cart up front. She then helped Asuka get off her wheelchair and back to bed, then set up the girl's breakfast of ramen (the real deal, not the instant variety), two rolls and orange juice onto the meal table. After thanking the nurse, Asuka promptly went eating her first solid meal, slurping the noodles with gusto.  
现在千草护士走了进来，推着一辆食品车。她帮助明日香从轮椅上下来回到床上，然后将女孩的早餐——真正的拉面（不是速食的那种）、两个卷饼和橙汁——摆放在餐桌上。在感谢了护士之后，明日香立刻开始享用她的第一顿固体食物，津津有味地吸着面条。

"So tell me, why did you want to help me?" Asuka asked, referring to her all-too-real dream last night.  
“那么告诉我，你为什么要帮我？”明日香问道，指的是她昨晚过于真实的梦境。

"I kind of pitied you when I saw you lying on the bed. Maybe sleeping but inside you felt as if you were drowning. I didn't want to stand around and watch the rest of you wallow in hopelessness."  
"看到你躺在床上，我有点同情你。也许是在睡觉，但内心感觉像是在溺水。我不想站在一旁，看着你继续在绝望中挣扎。"

"Thanks," the redhead sighed. "I was selfish. I sank too low that I thought it best to lie down and die after all the misery I had," she said, "until you came along and told me I have to let go. Now that you're here, I just wanted to have someone to talk to, and you're the first one since Hikari."  
"谢谢，"红发女子叹了口气。"我太自私了。我陷得太深，以至于我认为在经历了那么多痛苦之后，躺下死去是最好的选择，"她说，"直到你出现，告诉我必须放手。现在你在这里，我只想有个人可以聊聊，自从光之后，你是第一个。"

Kaworu nodded. 渚薰点了点头。

"And since you obviously know everything about me, I don't think I'll have anything else to hide."  
"既然你显然对我了如指掌，我想我没有什么需要再隐瞒的了。"

"So this time it's just between you and me," he said.  
"这次就只有你和我了，" 他说。

The girl stopped eating, took a breath and looked at Kaworu.  
女孩停止了进食，深吸一口气，看向渚薰。

"I believed myself I was right about everything," Asuka said. "I thought I could fill that emptiness in me and deny the past by being superior to everyone else. I wanted to escape, go past Mom's death, yet as I tried I felt unsatisfied, so I made myself larger than anyone else, say that I have the biggest brain in the neighborhood. By building a façade of my personality, I thought I was much important, the big shot."  
"我一直以为自己是对的，" 明日香说。"我以为通过比别人更优秀，就能填补内心的空虚，否认过去的存在。我想逃避，超越母亲的死，但越是尝试，越感到不满足，于是我让自己变得比任何人都强大，宣称自己是附近最聪明的人。通过构建一个个性假象，我以为自己变得非常重要，是个大人物。

"And now…?"

"What's the point of busting my ass for all of this," Asuka lamented, gesturing with her arms sweeping around, "What's the use of being so self-important, when I realize that I nearly killed myself over something so trivial, shallow and worrisome? Well, it makes sense now to leave. Leave? Yes… and live? Yes!"  
"我这么拼命到底是为了什么，" 明日香哀叹道，手臂挥舞着四周，"当我意识到自己差点为了一件如此琐碎、肤浅且令人烦恼的事情丧命时，自视甚高又有什么用呢？现在离开变得合情合理了。离开？是的……而活下去？是的！"

"But what about your Eva? I'll let you make another chance."  
"但你的 Eva 怎么办？我会给你另一次机会。"

"You told me to try again, but I can't… It's not worth it!"  
"你让我再试一次，但我做不到……这不值得！"

Feeling the weight of the world upon her, the redhead cradled her face upon open palms, and then stroked them up to the back of her head to straighten her hair, before ending it with a sigh. Kaworu approached her close enough to look into her eyes.  
感受到世界的重压，红发女子用摊开的双手托住脸颊，随后顺着头顶抚平头发，最后叹了口气。渚薰走近她，近到足以凝视她的双眼。

"Kaworu?" Asuka spoke in almost a whisper.

"Yes?"

"Can I cry? I can't hold them back... I've been having a bad time for too long…" This time her eyes were already welling up with tears, and she also felt a lump in her throat.  
“我可以哭吗？我再也抑制不住了...我已经经历了太久的糟糕时光…”这一次，她的眼眶已经盈满泪水，喉咙也感到哽咽。

The young man nodded. "Sure, it's okay."  
年轻人点点头。“当然，没关系。”

The next thing was Asuka sobbing onto Kaworu's chest, as he let his hand comfort the girl's back to reassure her.  
接下来的一幕是明日香伏在渚薰的胸前啜泣，而渚薰则用手轻抚她的背，安慰着她。

After the final physical examination, Doctor Odani told Rei that she must get ready for her upcoming debrief, and so right now the First Children was taking a shower. Her usual school uniform was outside the shower room, waiting for the girl to wear them.  
在最后一次体检后，医生长谷告诉绫波零她必须准备好即将到来的汇报，因此现在这位第一适格者正在洗澡。她平时穿的校服就放在浴室门外，等待着她穿上。

As she soaped her body, Rei found it uncharacteristic for Asuka to come into her room sounding more normal than hostile, but otherwise she thought it to be a direct result of the inevitable discharge, that she was trying to mend her bridges after burning them down.  
当她用肥皂涂抹身体时，绫波零觉得明日香以比平时更平和而非敌意的态度走进她的房间有些反常，但她认为这可能是由于不可避免的离别，明日香试图在烧毁桥梁后修复关系。

Whatever the reasons, and despite Rei's mixed feelings within, Asuka was now talking, trying to become more open rather than being confrontational and divisive.  
无论原因如何，尽管内心感受复杂，绫波现在正试图敞开心扉，而不是对抗和分裂。

On the other hand, she wondered what the Commander was doing right now. Maybe he was still thinking what to do, now that he terminated the Dummy Plug project permanently. Or maybe he was planning on what more to do with her.  
另一方面，她想知道指挥官现在在做什么。也许他还在思考下一步该怎么做，既然他已经永久终止了模拟插入栓项目。或者他可能在计划如何进一步利用她。

The last thought sent shivers coming down on Rei's spine. That man was, despite his setbacks, still in firm control of her fate. Ever since she was rescued, however, it seemed that the Commander has shut himself out, not trying to contact her or whatsoever, not even coming here out of genuine concern.  
最后一个念头让绫波感到脊背发凉。尽管遭遇挫折，那个男人依然牢牢掌控着她的命运。自从她被救出以来，指挥官似乎将自己封闭起来，没有试图联系她，也没有出于真正的关心来过这里。

With Rei able to access the unlocked past of her previous incarnation, she could recall that the Commander was almost always with her, and every time they were together he would study her as she floated in the LCL tank. As she did that she was trying to guess what was in his mind, and even then she didn't know much about him, let alone that he was acting as the father figure.  
随着丽能够访问她前世解锁的过去，她能回忆起指挥官几乎总是陪伴在她身边，每次他们在一起时，他都会在她悬浮在 LCL 槽中时研究她。她这样做时试图猜测他的心思，即便那时她对他了解不多，更不用说他扮演着父亲般的角色。

---

After she cried and then settled down, Asuka felt better, and now she resumed eating. The idea of letting go gave her a measure of a different kind of confidence.  
在她哭泣并平静下来后，明日香感觉好多了，现在她继续吃饭。放手让她获得了一种不同类型的自信。

"I noticed something about two of you," Asuka remarked as she attacked her buttered rolls between noodle slurps, pointing out Kaworu and Rei's overall physical appearances. "I find it strange but you two look almost alike."  
“我注意到你们两个有些特别，”明日香在吸面条的间隙攻击她的黄油卷时指出，指出了渚薰和丽的整体外貌。“我觉得奇怪，但你们俩看起来几乎一模一样。”

"I take that as a compliment," Kaworu answered.  
"我将其视为一种赞美，"渚薰回答道。

"Sure, and I'm guessing you're so close to Rei."  
"当然，我猜你和绫波那么亲近。"

Kaworu shrugged. "Can't help it, but from the time we first met I was trying to help her pull away from her predicament, such as not being able to remember after her last mission."  
渚薰耸了耸肩。"没办法，从我们第一次见面开始，我就一直在努力帮助她摆脱困境，比如她上次任务后无法记起事情。"

Asuka was busy chewing, before saying, "What else?"  
明日香正忙着咀嚼，随后问道：“还有什么？”

"Apart from that, I also tried to give Rei a bit of self-worth."  
“除此之外，我还试图给绫波一些自我价值感。”

The redhead wondered if there was something romantic going on between Kaworu and Rei. This perked her up. "So, are you trying to open her… mind?"  
红发女孩好奇是否真嗣和绫波之间有什么浪漫情愫。这让她精神一振。“所以，你是想打开她的……心扉？”

"In a sense, yes, because at the time I met her she looked helpless. Well, yesterday we had a very long talk, especially about her problems."  
"从某种意义上说，是的，因为当时我遇到她时，她看起来很无助。嗯，昨天我们进行了一次非常长的谈话，特别是关于她的问题。"

Asuka grinned. "Now that's progress," she praised. "Tell me, when you two would be coming out for a date?"  
明日香咧嘴一笑。"现在这可是进步了，"她称赞道。"告诉我，你们俩什么时候会出去约会？"

"A date?" Kaworu questioned. "I admit I have no idea about it."  
"约会？" 渚薰问道。"我承认我对这个一无所知。"

"Right," Asuka said, before she snickered. "Dear God, don't know what a date is? You go out with the other, enjoy yourselves at, for example, a theme park or while watching a movie or having dinner, just like in the movies."

Kaworu nodded. "I get the concept," he said. "When you go on a date, I believe, you're trying to get to know your opposite, a friend. That I think might be the case, as it doesn't look simple because I feel there's a lot more."

"To be candid, I went on a date," Asuka said, shrugging her shoulders before consuming another strand of noodles, "although my date wasn't right, as he was too stuffy and doesn't seem to be interested in girls, even if he was really footing the bill. Didn't matter – that med student was a genuine dweeb."

"I see. Perhaps if I could just find the time, maybe I'll learn how to do it and then try inviting Rei to a date."  
"我明白了。也许如果我能抽出时间，或许我会学会如何做，然后试着邀请丽去约会。"

Asuka was laughing, thinking Kaworu was making jokes about himself. "Good grief, are you from another planet?"  
明日香笑着，以为渚薰在拿自己开玩笑。"真是的，你是不是来自另一个星球？"

Kaworu shook his head, smiling. "No, but I haven't done dating in a very long time," he lied. Apparently for him she missed the irony.  
渚薰摇了摇头，微笑着。"不，但我已经很久没有约会过了，"他撒谎道。显然，她没有察觉到其中的讽刺意味。

"You may look a bit freaky, but at least you're the nicest and the most amusing guy I ever met. No kidding, as not all the boys back at school are just as nice as you."  
"你看起来可能有点怪异，但你是我遇到过最友善、最有趣的人。真的，不是开玩笑，学校里的男生没几个像你这么好的。"

"For a change, have you tried Shinji?" Kaworu suggested.  
"换个口味，你试过真嗣吗？" 渚薰建议道。"

The redhead almost dropped her chopsticks. "What? Him?" she questioned.  
红发女孩差点把筷子掉地上。"什么？他？" 她问道。

"Yes. I gather that he's the only one real close to you, even if you don't seem to like him."  
"是的。我看得出他是你唯一真正亲近的人，尽管你似乎并不喜欢他。"

"Oh, funny, I wish he had a spine. That's a problem especially if—"  
"哦，真有趣，我倒希望他有骨气。这问题尤其在——"

"You kissed him before," Kaworu said.  
"你之前吻过他，"渚薰说道。"

Like having a bomb dropped over her head, Asuka looked cross this time. "Good grief, he was so damned stiff! He couldn't do it right!" she complained. "Oh, no, I tried to get him interested in me, I let him kiss to test him out, but I don't know what's up with Shinji!"  
仿佛一颗炸弹在头顶爆炸，这次明日香看起来有些恼火。“天哪，他真是太死板了！他根本做不好！”她抱怨道，“哦，不，我试着让他对我感兴趣，我让他吻我来考验他，但我不知道真嗣到底怎么了！”

Kaworu shook his head. "Then perhaps try to change your approach because Shinji feels intimidated. Loosen up, tone down, and then understand him. He'll appreciate that."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“那么或许你应该改变一下方法，因为真嗣感到害怕。放松些，低调些，然后去理解他。他会感激的。”

Now Asuka remembered something she warned to Shinji before. "The walls of Jericho," she spoke.  
现在明日香想起了之前警告过真嗣的话。“耶利哥的城墙，”她低语道。

"Pardon me?"

The redhead sighed, setting aside the remains of her meal. "I should've torn those walls down instead. I sent him the wrong signals, I got it all wrong. I guess he didn't know about reverse psychology."  
红发女孩叹了口气，放下手中的残羹冷炙。“我本该拆掉那些墙的。我给了他错误的信号，全搞砸了。我想他不懂什么叫逆反心理。”

"I wished you made it simple enough for him to understand."  
“我真希望你能让他简单明了地理解。”

"Yeah."

There was a pause as Asuka silently sank into her thoughts, reflecting how her behavior somehow caused people to stay clear of her. First it was Kaji, and she tried to get close enough, her hormones buzzing like crazy, adoring him, and trying to make him seduce her, even as Kaji knew then that she was too young to understand, avoiding her amorous yet silly advances.  
一阵沉默，明日香静静地沉浸在自己的思绪中，反思自己的行为是如何让人避之不及。先是加持，她试图靠近他，荷尔蒙疯狂涌动，崇拜他，试图让他引诱自己，尽管加持那时就知道她太年轻不懂事，避开了她那既多情又幼稚的追求。

Sure, Kaji eventually bit the big one, but he was also right on the mark.  
当然，Kaji 最终还是挂了，但他当时确实说对了。

Then Shinji came into the picture, somehow despite his shortcomings, despite that their relationship was made out of necessity and duty, he tried to like her but Rei was the only other girl he truly conveyed his feelings and affections.  
后来，真嗣出现了，尽管他有种种不足，尽管他们的关系建立在必要和责任之上，他还是试图去喜欢她，但真正能传达他情感和爱意的，只有绫波。

Because Rei was seemingly harmless and receptive, almost a mother figure in Shinji's eyes, and Rei was everything that Asuka could not be, so the redhead became jealous of them, deluding herself in the belief that they were trying to steal her thunder. Her arrogance and ambition triggered the downfall, a lowered sync rate, the collapse of her world and everything she believed in.  
因为绫波看似无害且易于接受，在真嗣眼中几乎像个母亲，而绫波正是明日香所不能成为的一切，所以红发女孩开始嫉妒他们，自欺欺人地认为他们在试图抢走她的风头。她的傲慢和野心引发了崩溃，同步率下降，她的世界和她所信仰的一切都崩塌了。

Now her reawakening came with a new meaning, and Kaworu told her to go for a second chance in life, but first she must let go of the burdens that caused her trouble in the first place. Furthermore, there are hard questions that were gnawing her to answer.  
如今，她的重新觉醒被赋予了新的意义，渚薰告诉她去争取人生的第二次机会，但首先她必须放下那些最初给她带来困扰的负担。此外，还有一些棘手的问题在啃噬着她，等待她去回答。

"Kaworu?" Asuka said. “渚薰？”明日香说道。

"Yes?"

"Gimme some time to think and get ready for anything I would like to say before Shinji comes here. I guess it would be a very long talk between me and him."  
“给我一些时间思考，准备好我想对真嗣说的话。我想，这将是一场我和他之间非常漫长的谈话。”

Kaworu nodded, yet he smiled. "Sure, I understand," he answered. "Can I leave you for a while just to check on Rei?"  
渚薰点头微笑。“当然，我明白，”他回答，“我可以离开一会儿去看看绫波吗？”

Asuka returned the smile with a wave of her hand. "Okay, Kaworu… Thanks again for your company."  
明日香挥手回以微笑。“好的，渚薰……再次感谢你的陪伴。”

"My pleasure," he said before walking out of the door.  
“乐意之至，”他说完便走出了门。

Once she was alone, lying down, Asuka was planning everything she wanted to do today. Apart from a very serious conversation with Shinji, she would also make a phone call to Hikari, then lunch, maybe a talk with Misato, before giving Unit-02 one final look before departing. Her last day today, a swan song maybe, but what the hell, she must make the most of the opportunity to deal with loose ends until she boards the plane back to Germany.  
独自躺下后，明日香开始盘算今天想做的一切。除了与真嗣进行一次严肃的对话，她还要给光打个电话，然后是午餐，或许再和美里聊聊，临行前再去看看二号机。今天是她的最后一天，或许是一场天鹅之歌，但无论如何，她必须充分利用这个机会处理未了之事，直到登上返回德国的飞机。

Now some enigmas bugged Asuka: for all of his kindness, who is Kaworu Nagisa? What he's really doing here, and for what purpose? Where the hell he came from?  
现在有几个谜团困扰着明日香：尽管他如此善良，但渚薰究竟是谁？他来这里的真正目的又是什么？他到底是从哪里来的？

Suddenly she forgot to ask Kaworu how he managed to come into her dreams.  
她突然忘了问渚薰是如何进入她梦中的。

"I haven't seen Misato," Ritsuko said to Maya, this time the older woman nursing a Styrofoam cup of coffee and a freshly-lit cigarette. "How's she?"  
"我还没见到美里，" 律子对真希波说，这次年长的女人正捧着一杯泡沫塑料杯装的咖啡和一支刚点燃的香烟。"她怎么样了？"

Maya shook her head. "Oh, she had much more than she could handle, especially with the botched experiment. But she's trying to be all right, even after she lost Kaji."  
真希波摇了摇头。"哦，她承受的远超她的能力范围，尤其是那次失败的实验。但她仍在努力表现得一切正常，即便在失去了加持之后。"

Ritsuko looked up to the ceiling, wondering about the spy and who and what killed him. She could remember the old days, especially about Kaji's laid-back slacker attitude that ran counter to all formality, and his on-off relationship with Misato. Sometimes together maybe, but she couldn't be sure if Misato still really loved Kaji. She imagined thumbing the cat-themed gift he brought from Matsushiro months ago.  
律子抬头望向天花板，思索着那个间谍是谁，又是谁杀了他。她能回忆起往昔，尤其是加持那与所有正式场合格格不入的懒散态度，以及他与美里时断时续的关系。有时他们或许在一起，但她无法确定美里是否还真心爱着加持。她想象着自己摩挲着几个月前他从松代带来的那件猫咪主题的礼物。

"I wonder what happened with the investigation on Fuyutsuki's kidnapping," she said.  
"不知道关于冬月绑架案的调查进展如何了，" 她说道。

"I heard it's still ongoing," Maya answered. "Why?"  
"我听说还在进行中，" 真耶回答。"怎么了？"

"You better keep this in mind, but there's more to Kaji than what you think. I went to college with him and Misato, and I know him well. It's because of his job that he got killed… no, murdered is the right word."  
"你最好记住这一点，但加治比你想象的还要复杂。我和他在大学时与美里一起，我很了解他。正是因为他的工作，他才被……不，是被谋杀的。"

"And what he actually does for a living?"  
"他实际上是做什么的？"

Ritsuko paused for a moment. "He's a spy, period," she said. "Someone murdered him because he held too many secrets, and that makes him very dangerous. I think he was sent in to rescue the Sub-Commander but that was a ruse, to draw him into a trap."  
赤城稍作停顿。“他是个间谍，就这么简单，”她说道，“有人因为他掌握太多秘密而谋杀了他，这让他变得非常危险。我认为他是被派来营救副指挥官的，但那其实是个圈套，目的是引他入陷阱。”

Suddenly the older woman slapped her hands down to hips. "Holy shit," she muttered.  
突然，年长的女人双手猛地拍向腰间。“我靠，”她低声咒骂道。

"What's wrong?" Maya asked, looking perplexed  
"怎么了？" 真嗣问道，看起来很困惑

"Oh my… I fear that somehow and somewhere there's a mole here."  
"哦天哪…我担心这里不知怎么地混进了一个内鬼。"

"A mole?"

"Here's how: I once used to read one of those spy books about some villain working on the inside, had dug far enough to copy secrets or fake them all, and maybe even fuck up operations, the flow of intelligence, and decision-making. That's not even fiction, because there's this guy named Kim Philby who supposedly worked for British intelligence but he was really working for the KGB, doing all this mole business until he was caught. Now we have the same problem here. No wonder why we're running into blunders, and no wonder why Kaji ate a bullet."  
"情况是这样的：我以前读过一本间谍小说，讲的是一个反派潜伏在内部，深入到足以窃取机密或伪造它们，甚至可能破坏行动、情报流通和决策过程。这可不是虚构的，因为有个叫金·菲尔比的家伙，据说是为英国情报部门工作，但实际上他在为克格勃效力，一直在做这种内鬼的勾当，直到被抓。现在我们这里也遇到了同样的问题。难怪我们会接连犯错，难怪加持会中枪。"

Maya now looked alarmed. "What can we do about it?"  
玛雅现在显得有些惊慌。“我们能做些什么呢？”

Ritsuko's eyes narrowed. "Try asking Director Hamamoto as soon as possible to see if they can sniff out and catch the mole."  
律子的眼神变得锐利。“尽快去问问桥本主任，看看他们能否嗅出并抓住那个内鬼。”

Maya knew that Director Shuya Hamamoto was the head of Section Two. "Okay," she said.  
玛雅知道桥本修也主任是第二课的负责人。“好的，”她说。

"If this mole has his way, then soon enough we'll be at the losing end of a mahjongg game," Ritsuko concluded. _And no matter how, I think Kaji needs a measure of justice. I don't like to know that he died in vain,_ she added.  
"如果这个内奸得逞，那么不久我们就会在麻将桌上处于下风，"律子总结道。而且无论如何，我认为加持需要得到一些公正。我不希望知道他死得毫无价值，她补充说。

After parking the Audi right on front, then leaving Misato and Shinji at NERV HQ's main atrium, on their way to the Infirmary, Tsutomo Kanzaki walked through a long covered passageway to visit his boss at the office, which was the Second Section Annex Building located behind the main HQ pyramid. This edifice had three aboveground levels and three more basement levels, and it even has its own huge garage for its pool of service vehicles. In this building all of NERV's security and intelligence needs are being serviced on a daily basis.  
停好奥迪车后，将美里和真嗣留在 NERV 总部大厅，前往医务室的路上，Tsutomo Kanzaki 穿过一条长长的有顶通道，去拜访他的上司，办公室位于主总部金字塔后面的第二分部附属楼。这座建筑有三层地上楼层和三层地下楼层，甚至有自己的大型车库供服务车辆使用。在这座大楼里，NERV 的日常安全和情报需求都得到了满足。

At the end of the passageway, he reached the guarded reception area in front of the building, the threshold of the Section Two's sanctum sanctorum, where his fellow colleagues were at work, in their cubicles with reams of paperwork, in the armory where they checked their weapons, watching everything in the surveillance room, or practicing at the shooting range, at the gym, or the so-called "house of horrors" used for close quarter combat training.  
在走廊的尽头，他抵达了建筑前戒备森严的接待区，这里是第二部门圣地的门槛，他的同事们正忙碌着：有的在隔间里处理成堆的文件，有的在军械库检查武器，有的在监控室注视着一切，还有的在射击场、健身房，或是被称为“恐怖屋”的近战训练场所中练习。

Tsutomo presented his ID card to the guard at the reception desk, who then took his fingerprint and pupil scans for identification, before signing the details of his visit on a logbook. The young agent then walked over to the lock where he swiped his passcard over the sensor and the doors opened for him leading to its main hall. From there he had to ride an elevator to the third floor, then once out he walked on the wide aisle dividing the huge room, passing the cubicles occupied by other agents. The aisle led directly to Hamamoto's glass-paneled office, where at the moment he could see the old man furiously laboring over his latest set of problems – laid in heaps of paper – on the teak-wood desk. Mounted on the bookshelf, just behind the old man was an old sheathed daikatana on its cradle.  
堤文向接待处的警卫出示了身份证，随后进行了指纹和瞳孔扫描以确认身份，并在访客日志上登记了来访详情。年轻的特工接着走到门禁处，用通行卡在感应器上刷过，通往主厅的门便为他开启。从那里，他需乘坐电梯到达三楼，出电梯后沿着宽敞的过道前行，经过其他特工的隔间。过道直通滨本先生的玻璃隔间办公室，此刻他能看到老人正对着最新一批问题——堆成小山的文件——在柚木办公桌上奋力工作。书架上，就在老人身后，摆放着一把旧时的大太刀，安放在其底座上。

A father of two, a driven man with generations of warriors in the bloodline, Shuya Hamamoto worked once as an intelligence officer within the Maritime Self-Defense Force until he retired early as lieutenant-commander, then NERV hired him to this lofty position, dutifully holding it for several years. This month, however, he was due to retire for good, to devote more time to his family in Kobe and for the sake of his declining health. Much to his chagrin, however, the latest series of NERV bungles worsened his mood and well-being.  
身为两个孩子的父亲，一个血液中流淌着几代战士基因的执着男人，濑户山修也曾在海上自卫队担任情报官员，直至提前退役成为中校，随后 NERV 聘请他担任这一高级职位，多年来他恪尽职守。然而这个月，他即将彻底退休，以便有更多时间陪伴在神户的家人，并照顾自己日益衰退的健康。但令他懊恼的是，NERV 最近的一系列失误加剧了他的情绪和健康问题。

Tsutomo knocked on the glass door, and his boss gestured him to come inside. Once he was standing in attention before his boss, both men saluted to each other and Hamamoto invited him to sit down.  
堤友知敲了敲玻璃门，他的上司示意他进来。当他立正站在上司面前时，两人互相敬礼，濑户山邀请他坐下。

"Still having trouble, sir?" Tsutomo asked.  
“还在烦恼吗，长官？”堤友知问道。

"Hell, yes," Hamamoto answered, who looked pretty upset as both of them sat down. "Someone's having a field day fucking things up right here. I don't know who or what we're up against, but you and I know that lately there's a string of incidents that are making our jobs very difficult: the kidnapping of the Sub-Commander, the Kaji murder, then some intel fuck-up on the ground while we tried looking for the Second Children around this punch-bowl valley, and now this Bakelite sabotage which nearly caused Unit One to stomp its way out. We can't deny the fact that there's a mole, or a bunch of moles hiding here somewhere right now."  
"见鬼，没错，" 滨本回答道，看起来相当恼火，两人坐了下来。"有人在这里大肆破坏，搞得一团糟。我不知道是谁，也不知道我们面对的是什么，但你我都知道，最近一系列事件让我们的工作变得异常艰难：副司令被绑架，加治被杀，然后我们在寻找二号机时地面情报又出了问题，就在这个像碗一样的山谷里，现在又来了这个酚醛塑料的破坏行为，差点让初号机失控暴走。我们不能否认，这里肯定有内鬼，或者是一群内鬼在暗中潜伏。"

"I'm sure the counter-intel guys are working on it pronto," Tsutomo said.  
"我相信反情报部门的人已经在抓紧处理了，" 堤文说。"

Hamamoto sighed. "You bet I ordered them to do that, as I'm getting really sick of having these SNAFUs, because the pressure's on me to stop them. I even got a call from that prick of an iceman right from the top, demanding me to explain why there was a goddamn leak about yesterday's compatibility test, which was supposed to be top secret!"  
滨本叹了口气。"我当然命令他们去做了，因为我实在是受够了这些混乱局面，因为压力全在我身上，要我阻止这一切。我甚至接到了那个冰山脸高层的电话，质问我为什么昨天的适配测试——本该是绝密的——会泄露出去！"

Unfazed by his boss' pent-up anger and understanding his situation, Tsutomo nodded. Since NERV's founding, the Section Two guys gave Commander Ikari the secret nickname of Iceman because of his cold, harsh personality; they may be following orders but most of them wished the anal-retentive Commander should at least cut them some slack.  
面对上司积压的怒火，理解其处境的筒友点了点头。自 NERV 成立以来，第二部门的成员因碇司令冷酷严厉的性格，私下给他起了个绰号——冰人；他们虽然服从命令，但多数人都希望这位一丝不苟的司令能稍微通融一下。

"All right, I guess you've brought Major Katsuragi down here," Hamamoto said, now his temper lowered to near zero.  
“好吧，我想你已经把葛城少校带到这里了，”滨本说，他的火气现在降到了几乎为零。

"She's present to debrief the two Children, Ayanami and that newcomer Nagisa. Needed to know what happened yesterday. Afterwards, she'll be accompanying Miss Langley to the airport."  
“她来这里是为了向两位孩子，绫波和那个新来的渚，进行简报。需要了解昨天发生了什么。之后，她会陪同绫羽小姐去机场。”

"I see. I wonder whether if she got over with Kaji's death, because sometimes before I seen them together here, and I'm sure they were once lovers. Now that Kaji had bought the farm, I bet she's expecting us to get that case solved or else, given her attitude, she could do something very drastic, like hunting down the moles herself because it's all personal."  
"我明白了。我在想她是否已经从加持的死中走出来了，因为之前我在这里见过他们在一起，我确信他们曾经是恋人。现在加持已经阵亡，我敢打赌她正期待我们解决这个案子，否则以她的态度，她可能会做出非常极端的事情，比如亲自去追查那些鼹鼠，因为这一切对她来说都是私事。"

"You mean vengeance." "你是说复仇。"

"That's right," Hamamoto agreed. "Now, regarding the planned convoy, we've put up the other escorts ready in full gear and fuel. So far the recon team who checked the route said all clear and nothing out of the ordinary, but even then we need to keep our eyes peeled, because I sense that someone will go take a bite out of us right in the open."  
"没错，" 羽本木同意道。"关于计划的护送行动，我们已经准备好了其他护卫，装备齐全并加满燃料。到目前为止，侦察队检查路线后报告一切正常，没有异常情况，但即便如此，我们仍需保持警惕，因为我感觉会有人在光天化日之下对我们发起攻击。"

"So, sir, that's why you decided not to use air transport for Miss Langley?"  
"那么，先生，这就是您决定不为兰利小姐使用航空运输的原因吗？"

Hamamoto nodded. "Our Cheyennes will be used only for air support while the convoy's in transit," he said, referring to the heavily-armed VTOL transport gunships in the NERV inventory. "They'll keep an eye above the convoy, and if it comes to worse, good for medevac should we draw some casualties, and I hope we'll see none. That girl's our bait to draw those damned moles and sleepers out of the woods, and once we see them with the guns, we bag those sons of bitches and if possible I want them caught alive before dinner. Then we find out who's their big daddy. Problem solved."  
Hamamoto 点了点头。“我们的夏延人直升机将仅用于空中支援，当车队在途中时，”他指的是 NERV 库存中装备精良的垂直起降运输武装直升机。“它们会监视车队的上空，如果情况恶化，可以进行医疗撤离，如果我们有人受伤，我希望不会。那个女孩是我们的诱饵，用来引出那些该死的地鼠和卧底，一旦我们看到他们带着枪，我们就抓住那些狗娘养的，如果可能的话，我希望在晚餐前活捉他们。然后我们会找出他们的大佬是谁。问题就解决了。”

"What about the consignment?"  
"那批货物怎么办？"

"The ruse is enough to draw their attention away from it, which is the second reason for this mission."  
"这个计谋足以让他们转移注意力，这也是这次任务的第二个原因。"

"I haven't told Katsuragi about the actual gameplan."  
"我还没告诉桂木真正的计划。"

"Good. Always keep it that way, don't tell them unless the situation goes out of hand."  
"很好。始终保持这样，除非情况失控，否则不要告诉他们。"

"Got that, sir," Tsutomo agreed. "By the way, can you allow Shinji Ikari to be with the convoy?"  
"明白了，先生，" 筒本同意道，"顺便问一下，您能让碇真嗣加入车队吗？"

The old man thought for it for a moment, before he nodded. "Sure, son, he's in because he's been with the girl long enough that, considering how long she was in the Infirmary, I think she'll need some added support."  
老人思考了一会儿，然后点点头。"当然可以，孩子，他加入是因为他和那女孩相处的时间够长了，考虑到她在医务室待了那么久，我想她会需要一些额外的支持。"

"Thank you, sir. I'll make sure nothing will go wrong."  
"谢谢您，先生。我会确保一切顺利。"

The old man stood up, causing Tsutomo to do the same, before they saluted each other. "Just remember that only fire back when fired upon," he advised, "and always have eyes on your six, son. Good luck on your way."  
老人站起身来，敦促着 Tsutomo 也一同起立，随后他们互相敬礼。“记住，只有被攻击时才反击，”他告诫道，“永远要留意你的六点钟方向，孩子。祝你一路顺风。”

Shinji and Misato were standing at the hallway of the Infirmary when she told him, "Go to Asuka while I take care of the debriefing."  
真嗣和美里站在医务室的走廊上，她对他说：“去找明日香，我去处理汇报。”

"Okay," he answered, but he looked anxious.  
“好的，”他回答，但神情显得焦虑。

Misato smiled a bit. "You're a big boy now, so don't be afraid. Just be yourself, and put your best foot forward."  
美里微微一笑。“你现在是个大孩子了，所以不要害怕。做你自己，全力以赴就好。”

"What about you?" “那你呢？”

"Don't worry, I'll come later. We still have lots of time here before we leave."  
“别担心，我稍后会来。我们离开前还有很多时间。”

Shinji walked away, leaving Misato behind, and as he approached Asuka's room he was thinking whether she could still stand him, or how she could accept his appearance. He also wondered if the girl still has even a bit of concern or affection for him. He couldn't know all the answers, until he finally came to the doorway, pausing to take a deep breath and straighten out his clothes to add a boost of confidence, trying to fight the butterflies in his stomach. He could hear what sounded like a radio tuned to a rock station.  
真嗣走开了，留下美里在身后，当他走向明日香的房间时，他在想她是否还能忍受他，或者她如何能接受他的出现。他还想知道，那个女孩是否对他还有一丝关心或感情。他无法知道所有的答案，直到他终于来到门口，停下脚步深吸一口气，整理了一下衣服以增加自信，试图驱散胃里的蝴蝶。他能听到听起来像是调到摇滚电台的收音机声。

_Here goes nothing,_ he thought as he opened the door.  
就这样吧，他想，随即打开了门。

There was Asuka, sitting upright on her bed, quietly expecting him, while the radio on the bedside table playing a Cranberries track. She looked haggard, but otherwise there was remorse in her eyes that told him she wasn't in the mood for a shouting match, as it was before the Angel attacked her. Instead of an outburst, she merely greeted, "Hello, Shinji."  
明日香正笔直地坐在床上，静静地等待着他，床头柜上的收音机播放着小红莓乐队的曲子。她看起来憔悴，但她的眼中流露出悔意，告诉他她现在没有心情像天使攻击她之前那样大吵大闹。没有爆发，她只是简单地打招呼，“你好，真嗣。”

"Uh… Good morning, Asuka," he responded, picking the best polite answer possible. "How are you doing?"  
"呃…早上好，明日香，" 他回应道，尽可能选择了最礼貌的回答。"你还好吗？"

The girl sighed. "Just okay, even if I'm a bit tired because of the damned sedatives."  
女孩叹了口气。"就那样吧，虽然因为那些该死的镇静剂有点累。"

Shinji went to sit down on a vacant chair beside her bed and said, "I thought you might want to talk to me."  
真嗣走到她床边的一张空椅子坐下，说道："我想你可能想和我聊聊。"

Asuka nodded. "Yeah, I'm going home. I'm done here because I think there's a life much better than being a pilot. I want to walk away clean. I don't want to worry too much anymore. I want to be _normal_. Instead, I'm sorry for everything I did."  
明日香点点头。“嗯，我要回家了。我觉得有比当驾驶员更好的生活。我想干净利落地离开。不想再过多担忧。我想过正常生活。为此，我为我所做的一切道歉。”

Shinji did a double-take. "Why?"  
真嗣愣了一下。“为什么？”

Asuka took a breath. "Because it's my damned fault for being so much of a bitch at everyone, especially you," she admitted.  
明日香深吸一口气。“因为这都是我自找的，我对每个人都太刻薄了，尤其是你，”她承认道。

Tsutomo Kanzaki was on his way back to his waiting Audi staff car, almost running, when at a corner he unexpectedly bumped into a man carrying a laptop bag, with a Section Two ID card clipped onto his suit. For a moment he caught the man's name and department on the card: Keith Sanderson, Reports and Requirements Department; he was the former CIA man who now refined and polished the paperwork from raw field info to readable reports.  
円月照正走在返回等候的奥迪公务车的路上，几乎是在小跑，却在转角处意外撞上了一个提着笔记本包、西装上夹着二处 ID 卡的男人。他瞥见卡片上的名字和部门：基思·桑德森，报告与需求部门；这位前中情局人员如今将原始的现场信息精炼成可读报告。

"Sorry," Tsutomo apologized before he quickly got up onto his feet and went back on track.  
“抱歉，”円月照道歉后迅速起身，继续前行。

Sanderson, on the other hand, merely looked away without a word as he frowned, picking up his bag and stood up. _You losers aren't going to make it out alive,_ he thought.  
而桑德森只是皱着眉头，一言不发地转过头，捡起包站了起来。他心想，你们这些失败者是活不下来的。

**Author's Notes:** It's been weeks since the previous chapter, because I had to deal with problems on my side, and perhaps hopefully I'm out of it.  
作者笔记：距离上一篇chapter已经过去几周了，因为我这边有些问题需要处理，希望现在能顺利解决。

By now, this morning the national elections will be held, and I hope that whoever wins the highest post in the land shouldn't screw up in the next six years.  
今天早上将举行全国大选，我希望无论谁赢得最高职位，在未来六年里都不要搞砸。

As usual the dialogue and the flow needed a big deal of thinking, especially when I was trying to get Asuka's personality done in a proper way; and at the same time try to see how a person adjusts to life after a long time in the bed. There's at least one or two loose ends (from some previous chapters) dealt with. I also wanted to see how things are going on inside Section Two, perhaps one of the most misunderstood parts of NERV.  
一如既往，对话和情节需要大量思考，尤其是在尝试以恰当的方式展现明日香的性格时；同时还要考虑一个人在长时间卧床后如何适应生活。至少有一两个之前章节的未解之谜得到了处理。我还想探究一下第二分部内部的情况，这可能是 NERV 中最容易被误解的部分之一。

If there's anything wrong, try to drop me a line. Thanks for coming with me this far, I'll try to keep up.  
如果有任何问题，请尽量给我留言。感谢你一路相伴，我会努力跟上。

### Chapter 16 21 Guns

In a windowless, whitewashed room somewhere in the Geofront, Rei Ayanami was sitting on a folding chair, opposite Misato Katsuragi, with a plain square table between them. Just behind Misato was a digital video camera on a tripod, recording everything, and she held a sheet of paper stating the rights of the interviewee. On the table were a notebook and a pen, and the camera's remote control. At the far corner of the room was a tea service cart, and Rei knew that Kaworu was just outside the room, waiting for his turn. Only one part of the wall had a mirror, and she guessed it must be a one-way mirror, so someone was surely watching her.  
在 Geofront 某处一个没有窗户、粉刷成白色的房间里，绫波零坐在一把折叠椅上，对面是葛城美里，两人之间隔着一张普通的方形桌子。美里身后是一台三脚架上的数字摄像机，记录着一切，她手中拿着一张列有被采访者权利的纸张。桌上放着笔记本和笔，还有摄像机的遥控器。房间的远角处有一辆茶点推车，绫波知道渚薰就在房间外等待他的轮次。只有一面墙上有镜子，她猜测那应该是一面单向镜，所以肯定有人在观察她。

She will have to answer everything she knew about yesterday's incident, and the girl must watch her words.  
她必须回答关于昨天事件所知道的一切，而这女孩必须谨慎措辞。

"Miss Ayanami," Misato said, reading the girl's rights. "By agreeing to this inquest, understand that anything you say in the next half-hour will be used to help the investigators answer questions about the failed compatibility test. As your commanding officer, I assure you that your statements, which will be recorded by that video camera right behind me for documentation purposes, will not be used against you by any disciplinary body for any infractions. Furthermore, under Section 15 in the NERV Manual of Conduct and Regulations, I assure that your rights will be upheld, and all contents of that video recording of the proceedings will be kept confidential. Is that clear?"  
"绫波小姐," 美里读着女孩的权利。"通过同意这次审讯，请理解你在接下来的半小时内所说的任何话都将被用来帮助调查人员解答关于失败的兼容性测试的问题。作为你的指挥官，我向你保证，你的陈述，将由我身后那台摄像机记录下来以供文件存档，不会被任何纪律机构用来对你进行任何违规行为的指控。此外，根据 NERV 行为准则和条例第 15 条，我保证你的权利将得到维护，审讯过程的视频记录的所有内容都将保密。清楚了吗？"

The First Children nodded. "Yes."  
第一适格者点了点头。"是的。"

Misato tabled the rights paper. "Good. Now let's begin by identifying yourself."  
美里将权利文件放在一旁。"很好。现在让我们从确认你的身份开始。"

"I am Rei Ayanami, First Children. I am fourteen years of age, female, service number 300192. I am permanently assigned to the Evangelion Project, formerly the pilot of Eva Prototype Unit Zero, destroyed recently, and currently I am not on active duty."  
“我是绫波零，初号机驾驶员。我今年十四岁，女性，服役编号 300192。我永久隶属于福音计划，曾是零号机原型机的驾驶员，该机近期已被摧毁，目前我未在现役中。”

Misato nodded. "Okay. Now tell me what happened yesterday. You can go from the beginning."  
美里点头道：“好的。现在告诉我昨天发生了什么。你可以从头开始说。”

For the first time in days, Shinji and Asuka have finally come face to face with each other. The young man was the first to break the silence after a moment.  
时隔多日，真嗣和明日香终于面对面相见。片刻后，年轻人率先打破了沉默。

"I've been worried about you," he said. "Every time I see you on the bed, I… I felt responsible. I wanted to protect you but my father held me back. Then you ran away and… I was shocked when I found out. You see, I wanted you not to be that empty shell on the bed, and I was then angry at myself for letting you down, and angry at him for putting me down." Shinji sighed.  
"我一直很担心你，"他说。"每次看到你躺在床上，我……我感到自己有责任。我想保护你，但父亲阻止了我。然后你逃走了……当我得知这一切时，我震惊了。你知道，我希望你不再是床上那个空壳，我对自己让你失望感到愤怒，对他贬低我感到愤怒。"真嗣叹了口气。

"But Shinji," Asuka said. "I just have to admit this to you, but… I'm useless now. I'm sure that Misato may have told you what's behind me. I never told everyone my past, as I denied it too often."  
"但是真嗣，"明日香说。"我必须向你承认，但……我现在没用了。我确信美里可能已经告诉了你我背后的故事。我从未向大家透露过我的过去，因为我经常否认它。"

"You mean…"

"Kaworu said that I'm no different from you other than changing a few details. My mother killed herself after going mad; my dad married someone I despised because she had an affair with him. All that made me angry enough to put much distance from them, no matter what they say."  
“渚薰说过，我和你除了一些细节不同，本质上没什么区别。我母亲在发疯后自杀了；我父亲娶了一个我憎恶的女人，因为她和他有染。这些事让我愤怒到无论如何都要与他们保持距离。”

The redhead sighed before going on. "After she died, I then made a promise myself to bury the past, not to cry anymore. I don't want to see the nightmare of her strangling my neck, or watching her hanging from the ceiling. I don't want to see myself like that, yet after that Angel nearly killed me, after I've lost my strength I was close to dying like her."  
红发女孩叹了口气，继续说道：“她去世后，我对自己许下承诺，要埋葬过去，不再哭泣。我不想再看到她掐我脖子的噩梦，或是眼睁睁看着她吊在天花板上。我不想变成那样，但在那使徒几乎杀了我之后，在我失去力量，濒临死亡之际，我差点就和她一样了。”

Asuka showed her bandaged wrists to Shinji, who nodded quietly.  
明日香向真嗣展示了她包扎着绷带的手腕，真嗣默默地点了点头。

"By making myself superior to everyone else," Asuka said, "I thought I could conquer everything even the past, but the past always tries to leak out. Even then I tried to stop the nightmares, but they almost always came back."  
"通过让自己凌驾于所有人之上，" 明日香说，"我以为我可以征服一切，甚至是过去，但过去总是试图泄露出来。即便如此，我试图阻止那些噩梦，但它们几乎总是卷土重来。"

Shinji hung his head, pursed his lips.  
真嗣低下头，紧抿着嘴唇。

"Look," Asuka said. "Listen to me… I've spent my entire life on Eva. I thought about piloting, ate, drank, slept… I studied for the job. I loved every minute being in control, going off to battle… I then loved the fix of being in Eva, I felt the adrenaline whenever I'm the pilot… But no more."  
"听着，" 明日香说。"听我说……我的一生都在 EVA 上度过。我思考着驾驶，吃、喝、睡……我为这份工作学习。我喜欢每一分钟掌控一切的感觉，奔赴战场……我那时喜欢驾驶 EVA 的快感，每当我是驾驶员时，我都能感受到肾上腺素的飙升……但不再了。"

The redhead sighed. 红发少女叹了口气。

"All I ever wanted then was for people to see me as 'mature'. I want to be seen as a grown-up, able to take care of myself. I then insisted on asking for no help. Doing those I thought would make me happy… I was really deluding myself. I'm just like you."  
“那时我一心只想让别人认为我‘成熟’。我希望被看作一个能自立的成年人。于是我坚持不寻求帮助，做那些我认为会让我快乐的事……其实我只是在自欺欺人。我和你一样。”

Shinji raised his head and stared at Asuka. "I finally saw why you are hiding your true self. Yes, I'm the same as you are, too… I was a pilot for a different reason, though at first I never wanted this in the first place."  
真嗣抬起头，凝视着明日香。“我终于明白你为何隐藏真实的自己了。是的，我和你一样……虽然我成为驾驶员的原因不同，但一开始我根本就不想要这样。”

He imagined his father towering over him, indifferent and cold.  
他想象着父亲高耸在他之上，冷漠无情。

"I wanted to be accepted," he said, "to be praised, so that I can be happy, but I couldn't get enough. I also thought that by doing everything to please him, my father could pay attention to me but he was always far away. I thought he hated me by using me to be stuck in bad things I don't want. Like when he let the Dummy Plug take over Unit One."  
“我渴望被接纳，”他说，“被赞扬，这样我才能快乐，但我总觉得不够。我也以为，只要竭尽全力取悦他，父亲就会注意到我，可他总是遥不可及。我甚至觉得他利用我陷入了我不想面对的困境。就像他让 Dummy Plug 接管初号机那次。”

The young man closed his eyes with remorse.  
年轻人懊悔地闭上了眼睛。

"For that, and I felt responsible for Toji, I was angry at Father, so I wanted to give up and leave. I tried to leave, but for some reason I couldn't because there's something that kept me back, just like when the Angel went down to the Geofront and nearly killed everyone. That made me come back to save you all as I felt I couldn't simply leave the relationships I mad. I fought because I don't want everyone to die, and I realized my purpose.  
"为此，我觉得自己对冬二负有责任，我对父亲感到愤怒，所以我想放弃并离开。我试图离开，但由于某种原因我无法做到，因为有东西让我留了下来，就像天使降临到地底都市并差点杀死所有人时一样。这让我回来拯救你们，因为我感到我不能就这样离开我建立的关系。我战斗是因为我不想让任何人死去，我意识到了我的使命。"

"But then things began to fall apart; first, there was Toji, then the other Angel attacked you, before Ayanami went down, until I was afraid, I couldn't do anything until Kaworu came here and talked to me about my fears."  
"但随后事情开始崩溃；首先是冬二，然后是另一个天使攻击了你，接着绫波也下去了，直到我感到害怕，我什么也做不了，直到渚薰来到这里，和我谈起我的恐惧。"

"What did he told you?"  
"他跟你说了什么？"

"Get myself a grip, try not to be afraid. He said he was concerned about me, so I took his advice and tried to be a better person."  
"稳住自己，尽量别害怕。他说他担心我，所以我听从他的建议，努力成为一个更好的人。"

"He came to me, too," Asuka said. "We talked, and I said I've done too many mistakes, I was too harsh, and I nearly killed myself because I didn't realize I was being immature. Instead, Kaworu told me to change for the better."  
"他也来找过我，"明日香说。"我们聊了，我说我犯了很多错，太严厉了，差点因为没意识到自己的不成熟而自毁。相反，渚薰告诉我应该变得更好。"

"I understand," Shinji answered.  
"我明白，"真嗣回答道。"

The girl closed her eyes. "Shinji, I'm very sorry," Asuka mumbled.  
女孩闭上了眼睛。“真嗣，我很抱歉。”明日香喃喃道。

"No… I'm sorry, too."

Both Children stared at each other. It was true enough, there was no difference between them, their individual desires and hates, though wildly different, were nothing compared to the common pain they shared: Mothers consumed by the Evas they occupied; fathers who neglected or abandoned them; they lived lives of misery, fear and self-delusion; they tried to gain acceptance, but at a bitter price; they sought happiness, but left unsatisfied and hungry. It was only fate that put them here together, and though they once despised each other, today they have to face the music.  
两个孩子彼此凝视。确实如此，他们之间并无差异，尽管各自的欲望和憎恨截然不同，但与他们共同承受的痛苦相比，这些都微不足道：母亲们被她们所驾驶的 Eva 吞噬；父亲们忽视或遗弃了他们；他们生活在痛苦、恐惧和自我欺骗中；他们试图获得接纳，却付出了沉重的代价；他们追求幸福，却始终感到不满足和饥饿。命运将他们带到了这里，尽管他们曾经互相憎恨，但今天他们必须共同面对现实。

There would be no illusions this time.  
这一次，不会再有幻想了。

"It's all even, Shinji," Asuka said, as the radio began to play The Fray's "Over My Head". "Forgive me instead. It's time for me to let go."  
"一切都扯平了，真嗣，" 明日香说道，此时收音机开始播放 The Fray 乐队的《Over My Head》。"原谅我吧。是时候让我放手了。"

Shinji thought of this and he answered, "I forgive you now, because we can't win anything by arguing over even the smallest things."  
真嗣想到这一点，回答道："我现在原谅你，因为我们不能通过争论哪怕是最小的事情来赢得任何东西。"

Asuka gave him a small smile. "Thanks," she said, and then pulled Shinji's arms to hug her tight. The girl then whispered to his ear, "Thanks for everything, even if you tried, even if you were frightened or feeling negative…"  
明日香对他微微一笑。"谢谢，"她说着，然后拉过真嗣的手臂紧紧拥抱她。女孩随后在他耳边低语，"感谢你所做的一切，即使你尝试过，即使你感到害怕或情绪消极……"

"Yes," Shinji answered almost quietly. "I did my best."  
“是的，”真嗣几乎轻声回答，“我尽了全力。”

_I held you, I helped you, and I did everything.  
我抱住你，我帮助你，我做了所有能做的。_

The hug lasted for two minutes, before the couple disengaged gently, knowing that the war between them was over.  
拥抱持续了两分钟，随后两人温柔地分开，心知他们之间的战争已经结束。

---

After they went step-by-step through the uneventful sync procedures, Misato was now at the point where Rei talked about Unit-01 suddenly going berserk.  
在一步步完成了无波澜的同步程序后，美里现在听到了丽讲述初号机突然暴走的情况。

"Did the Eva invade your mind?" the woman officer asked.  
“Eva 侵入了你的意识吗？”女军官问道。

"It was different," Rei answered. "The past came back to me, those that I thought I had forgotten or I could not recall. I thought I was being erased, I remember being in pain. I could not even pull the ejection handle."  
“情况不同，”丽回答，“那些我以为已经遗忘或无法记起的过去回来了。我以为自己正在被抹去，我记得当时很痛苦。我甚至无法拉动弹射杆。”

"Have you also experienced total blackout? Lost consciousness?"  
"你也经历过完全的失忆吗？失去意识？"

"Yes."

Misato wrote down a few lines, before continuing.  
美里记下了几行字，然后继续说道。

"Medical records and mission logs showed that after your last sortie with Unit Zero you couldn't remember, you had some sort of amnesia, but Shinji said that you can now do it even with some small details. Is it true?"  
"医疗记录和任务日志显示，在你与零号机最后一次出击后，你出现了某种失忆症状，但真嗣说你现在甚至能回忆起一些细节。这是真的吗？"

"Yes," Rei agreed. "是的，" 丽同意道。

"Can you give an example or two? I'm all ears."  
"能举一两个例子吗？我洗耳恭听。"

Rei took a breath and began narrating the first time she met Shinji when the Angel attacked and he was fresh from arriving. She could remember being swaddled in bandages, still in the hospital bed, and Shinji was already panicking when the Angel made its first assault. The earth shook, causing steel beams and lights to come crashing down, but before the debris could impale them, the Eva moved her arm to shield the Children.  
丽深吸一口气，开始讲述她第一次遇见真嗣的情景，那时使徒来袭，他刚到达不久。她记得自己被绷带包裹着，还躺在医院床上，而真嗣在使徒第一次攻击时就已惊慌失措。大地震动，钢梁和灯光纷纷坠落，但在碎片刺穿他们之前，Eva 移动手臂保护了孩子们。

Quickly Misato scribbled some notes. Inwardly she was astonished by Rei's renewed capacity to recall everything, as she was also there on that same day.  
米萨托迅速记下一些笔记。她内心对丽重新恢复的记忆能力感到惊讶，因为那天她也在场。

"Okay… Can you remember when I had to tell Asuka to get along with Shinji? You know, their sync training a few months back?"  
“好吧……你还记得我不得不告诉明日香和真嗣好好相处的时候吗？你知道的，几个月前的同步训练？”

"Yes," Rei answered, before she started on her account of the two other Children arguing right in front of her, with Asuka refusing to get along with him and her; there was Hikari playing with Pen-Pen while Toji and Kensuke were wondering how Asuka could dance with Shinji.  
“是的，”丽回答，然后开始叙述另外两个孩子在她面前争吵的情景，明日香拒绝与他和她和睦相处；而光在和 Pen-Pen 玩耍，东治和健介则在想明日香怎么能和真嗣跳舞。

Again Misato could only blink. The same details, down to the exact dialogue and the description, and like Shinji reported, Rei told her past events to him as if they happened yesterday.  
米萨托再次只能眨眼。细节完全一致，连对话和描述都丝毫不差，正如真嗣所报告的，丽将过去的经历告诉真嗣，仿佛它们就发生在昨天。

"Rei," she said after a moment of contemplation, "let's take a short break as I sort this out. You may help yourself to some tea over there." Misato picked up the camera's remote control and pressed the Pause button.  
“丽，”她沉思片刻后说道，“我们先休息一下，让我整理一下思绪。你可以去那边自己倒杯茶。”米萨托拿起相机的遥控器，按下了暂停键。

"Thank you, Major," the girl answered, feeling relieved as she walked over to the tea service cart and began making a cup. She watched Misato stand up and walk out of the room through the door, notes in hand.  
“谢谢你，少校，”女孩回答道，感到一阵轻松，她走向茶水车开始泡茶。她看着米萨托站起身，拿着笔记走出了房间。

---

"Shinji?" Asuka asked. It's been minutes since they let the music from the radio fill out the room, as they contemplated about themselves, and hoping that with all their issues settled they could begin anew. Green Day was singing "Twenty-One Guns".  
"真嗣？" 明日香问道。自从他们让收音机里的音乐充满房间，已经过去了几分钟，他们各自沉思，希望所有问题解决后能有一个新的开始。绿日乐队正在唱着《二十一枪》。

The young man was still seated. "Yes?"  
年轻人依旧坐着。"什么事？"

"I wanted to know something… Like your past," she said. "I never bothered to ask you about it before."  
"我想知道一些事……比如你的过去，" 她说。"我以前从未费心问过你。"

"Me?"

"Yeah, like what you were doing when you were in kinder or something like that."  
"是啊，就像你在幼儿园时做的事情，或者类似的那种。"

"I was alone. Couldn't find friends. Sometimes after I finished my cello lessons I watched my neighbors' kids go home with their moms, so I wished Mom was with me so that I can be really happy."  
"我那时总是一个人，找不到朋友。有时候上完大提琴课，看着邻居的孩子们被妈妈接回家，我就希望妈妈也能在我身边，那样我就会真的很开心。"

Shinji sighed. "At nights I asked myself, 'Why do I have to live like this?' and 'Why I don't have a mother?'. Though my uncle was okay, inside I felt empty and lonely, needing something to fill that out. Then I wake up every morning, and look down at the gate at the front yard, wishing Mom suddenly appear right there. I always did that for years."  
真嗣叹了口气。"晚上我常常问自己，'为什么我得这样生活？'和'为什么我没有妈妈？'。虽然舅舅还不错，但内心总感觉空虚和孤独，需要什么来填补。然后每天早上醒来，我都会低头看着前院的门，希望妈妈突然出现在那里。多年来我一直是这样。"

The young man bowed his head, pursing his lips in disappointment. "But nothing happened in all those years until I realized there was no point hoping she wasn't gone. From kinder until before I came here, I walked home on my own. Every time there's a parent-teacher meeting, I was the only one in class who didn't have a parent; my uncle would come instead, and when I finished elementary and on the day of my graduation ceremony I even hoped someone would come, maybe even Father, though my uncle said that his work kept him from coming."  
年轻人低下头，失望地抿紧嘴唇。“但那些年什么都没发生，直到我意识到再怎么希望她没离开也是徒劳。从幼儿园到我来这里之前，我都是一个人走回家的。每次开家长会，我是班上唯一没有家长的孩子；我的叔叔会来代替，而当我小学毕业和毕业典礼那天，我甚至希望有人会来，也许是父亲，尽管叔叔说他因工作无法前来。”

.Shinji shook his head. "That night, I wished that somehow Father would accept me, and maybe give me even a bit of respect. When I received the letter from him, telling me to come, I never expected he would put me in here, right in the Entry Plug, trying to fight his battles while he stood there watching."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“那晚，我曾希望父亲能以某种方式接纳我，或许能给我哪怕一点点的尊重。当我收到他的信，让我来时，我从未料到他会把我放在这里，就在插入栓里，试图让我替他战斗，而他站在那里观看。”

Realizing that he was shedding tears, Shinji wiped them off with the sleeve of his shirt.  
意识到自己在流泪，真嗣用衬衫袖子擦去了泪水。

"I understand… It's lonely at the top," Asuka said.  
"我明白…高处不胜寒，"明日香说道。

"I thought you have friends," Shinji answered.  
"我以为你有朋友，"真嗣回答。

Asuka shook her head. "No, until I came here, I didn't have any true friends, only acquaintances. Some people would keep their distance from me because they're really afraid of smart people."  
明日香摇了摇头。"不，直到我来到这里，我没有任何真正的朋友，只有熟人。有些人会与我保持距离，因为他们真的很害怕聪明人。"

Asuka could remember back at college, when at nights she could see from her dorm window the throngs of young students walking together down the promenade, laughing and talking. While they were enjoying themselves, she shut herself in, stacks of books piled onto her study desk.  
明日香还能回想起大学时光，夜晚从宿舍窗户望出去，能看到成群的年轻学生在林荫道上结伴而行，欢声笑语。而她却将自己封闭起来，书堆如山地堆在书桌上。

"Did being a prodigy made me better? I don't know but I really lived in an ivory tower. I stood apart even from the other prodigies at my age. I thought I was a star, hungry for attention."  
“成为神童就意味着更好吗？我不确定，但我确实活在一个象牙塔里。我甚至与同龄的其他神童都格格不入。我以为自己是颗明星，渴望着关注。

The redhead imagined the press photographers flashing their cameras on her, walking away from yet another quiz bee competition, while her opponents scratched their heads. Next thing she gave out interviews on TV and the papers, crediting her intellect in winning victories.  
红发女孩想象着记者们对着她按下快门，她刚从又一次知识竞赛中胜出，而对手们还在挠头苦思。紧接着，她出现在电视采访和报纸上，将胜利归功于她的智慧。

"At one time I had one room full of trophies, certificates and medals, and that's all. I finished college with a double degree in mathematics and physics, and from there I told myself I can conquer the world."  
曾经，我有一间屋子堆满了奖杯、证书和奖牌，仅此而已。我以数学和物理双学位完成了大学学业，从那时起，我告诉自己我可以征服世界。

Asuka shook her head. "Now I realized they're nothing but just pieces of metal and paper, like what that Hudson guy in _Cars_ said: an empty cup. My selfishness came with a price, and was I'm happy about doing that? No, it really made me lonely."  
明日香摇了摇头。“现在我意识到它们不过是些金属和纸片，就像《汽车总动员》里的那个哈德森说的：一个空杯子。我的自私是有代价的，我对此感到高兴吗？不，这真的让我感到孤独。”

As Rei nursed her cup of tea, she remembered about Shinji coming to her home, wondering what she was doing at the time. Rei bought some Earl Grey, a strainer and a simple tea set for her to experiment on making her own, wanting to taste the real deal without having to rely on instant tea bags. Fortunately, Shinji came just in time and he taught her how to make tea correctly, even as she nearly scalded herself with a kettle full of boiling water.  
当绫波丽品着她的那杯茶时，她想起了真嗣来到她家的时候，想知道她当时在做什么。绫波买了一些伯爵茶、一个滤网和一个简单的茶具，想尝试自己制作，想要品尝真正的茶而不必依赖即溶茶包。幸运的是，真嗣来得正是时候，他教她如何正确泡茶，尽管她差点被一壶滚烫的开水烫伤。

She liked the memory of it, and that made her feel better. Now Rei wished she could do it again with someone, and share the experience.  
她喜欢这段记忆，这让她感觉好些了。现在丽希望她能再次与某人一起做这件事，并分享这份体验。

Suddenly she had an idea.  
突然，她有了一个主意。

_I could invite Kaworu for tea_, she thought.  
我可以邀请渚薰来喝茶，她想。

---

"I'm curious… Can you tell me about your mom?" Asuka inquired. The radio was playing an Incubus track.  
"我很好奇……你能跟我讲讲你妈妈吗？" 明日香问道。收音机里正播放着 Incubus 乐队的歌曲。

"Mom died a long time ago," Shinji said, "when I was three or four, I think."  
"妈妈很久以前就去世了，" 真嗣说，"我想是在我三四岁的时候吧。"

"What happened?"

Shinji sighed. "It's like this: she took me to some place I don't know. I could remember she was wearing a lab coat, talking to… I think it was the Sub-Commander. I don't know what they were talking about, but I could remember her saying something."  
真嗣叹了口气。"事情是这样的：她带我去了一个我不认识的地方。我记得她穿着一件实验室外套，和……我想是副司令在说话。我不知道他们在谈什么，但我记得她说了些什么。"

"Like what?"

"If I'm right… It went like this: she wanted to show me the bright future."  
"如果我没猜错……事情是这样的：她想向我展示光明的未来。"

"And where were you at that time?"  
"那你当时在哪里？"

The gears in Shinji's mind began to turn, trying to go back into the past, trying to recall every detail of that day, even if the past was also murky.  
真嗣的脑海中齿轮开始转动，试图回到过去，试图回忆起那一天的每一个细节，即使过去也是模糊不清的。

"I…" he stammered at first, but in two blinks of an eye he was there. Right before him, separated only by a thick sheet of Plexiglas, was the Eva with its fearsome scowl.  
"我…" 他起初结巴了一下，但转眼间便站在了那里。就在他面前，仅隔着一层厚厚的有机玻璃，是那台面露凶相的 Eva。

"I was here before," he whispered. "I thought I was going for some field trip with her."  
"我之前来过这里，" 他低声说道。"我以为我是和她一起去参加某个实地考察。"

He could imagine the concrete floor, the rubber sandals on his feet, and the wide-eyed expression on his face. The air-conditioning was a bit cold, the air ionized, the hushed voices of scientists, and there was the din of keyboards clacking behind him.  
他可以想象那混凝土地板，脚上的橡胶拖鞋，以及自己瞪大眼睛的表情。空调有点冷，空气被电离，科学家们的低语声，还有身后键盘的敲击声。

"But what happened next… everything went wrong. People scared, running everywhere, like they were trying to save her. Someone took me out of that place, grabbed me… I don't know why, except the next thing I knew someone was talking to me."  
"但接下来发生了什么…一切都乱套了。人们惊慌失措，四处奔逃，好像都在试图救她。有人把我带出了那个地方，抓住了我…我不知道为什么，只知道接下来有人开始对我说话。"

"Who?"

_Two scientists were standing before Shinji; one was trying to explain to the other. The klaxons blared while personnel were running about, mostly on their way to the disaster zone.  
两位科学家站在真嗣面前；其中一位正试图向另一位解释。警报声大作，人员四处奔走，大多赶往灾难现场。_

"_What in the world you have to do with this kid?" the other scientist demanded._  
"你跟这孩子有什么关系？""另一位科学家质问道。

"_I'll take care of him," the first one answered back._  
"我会照顾他的，"第一个回答道。

_Shinji shouted, "Where's Mama?"_

_The first scientist turned to him. He had gray hair, almost old, but at the moment he knelt down and faced Shinji, hands on the boy's shoulders.  
第一位科学家转向他。他有着灰白的头发，几乎可以说是老者，但此刻他跪下面对真嗣，双手放在男孩的肩膀上。_

"_Listen, Shinji… I'm Fuyutsuki, your mother's friend. You may not understand this, but she tried to do something that wasn't supposed to be part of the standard test procedure. She actually changed the parameters, causing this to happen. Anyway, this is my responsibility; I'm sorry for your mother, son, I have to get this fixed and we have to get her out! Just stay there, I'll be back!"_  
"听着，真嗣……我是冬月，你母亲的朋友。你可能不明白，但她试图做一些本不该是标准测试程序的一部分。她实际上改变了参数，导致了这一切的发生。无论如何，这是我的责任；我为你的母亲感到抱歉，孩子，我必须修复这个问题，我们必须把她救出来！你就待在那里，我会回来的！"

_Fuyutsuki ran off to the direction where the Eva stood.  
冬月朝那个 EVA 所在的方向跑去。_

"I don't really know how she died," Shinji said. "The next few days Father took me to my uncle, and just left me there. That, I think, is where I went wrong."  
“我不太清楚她是怎么死的，”真嗣说，“接下来的几天，父亲带我去见了叔叔，然后就把我留在那里。我想，那就是我走错的一步。”

---

In the other room, Misato was talking to Natsumi, who'd been there before the debriefing started, and watching everything through the one-way mirror along with a spare video camera recording everything. They could see Rei partake a cup of green tea, silently contemplating between sips. Natsumi held a bottle of Pocari Sweat, half-full and sloshing, before she took a swig.  
在另一个房间里，美里正在和夏美交谈，夏美在简报开始前就已经在了，她们通过单向镜观察着一切，并用一台备用摄像机记录下所有情况。她们可以看到丽端着一杯绿茶，静静地在啜饮间沉思。夏美拿着一瓶半满的宝矿力水特，摇晃着，然后喝了一口。

"You're right," Misato said, watching the doctor drink. "Just as you have reported, there's no sign of any symptom of amnesia, and the events she recalled were exactly as I remember, down to the smallest details."  
"你说得对，" 美里说道，注视着医生喝酒。"正如你所报告的，她没有任何失忆的症状，她回忆的事件与我记忆中的完全一致，甚至连最小的细节都丝毫不差。"

"I think my theory is becoming valid," Natsumi answered, placing the Pocari bottle on a nearby table.  
"我觉得我的理论越来越站得住脚了，" 娜兹美回答，将宝矿力水瓶放在附近的桌子上。"

The lady officer frowned. "What theory?"  
女警官皱起眉头。"什么理论？"

"My idea, sorry if it's so far-fetched, is that the Angel that attacked her and Unit Zero also served as some conduit as it came in contact with Unit One, linking Shinji and Rei and both Evas together."  
"我的想法，如果显得过于牵强，还请见谅，我认为攻击她和零号机的使徒在接触初号机时也起到了某种媒介作用，将真嗣和绫波以及两台 EVA 连接在一起。"

"A conduit for what?"  
"媒介什么？"

"Memories, emotions, or just about anything neural. As the Angel infested and linked those two, down to their cores, it was also transferring information between the Evas, especially memories of themselves and the Children. For that moment they were a single organism. In the case of Unit One, there was a significant change in its memory composition after the attack."  
"记忆、情感，或者任何神经层面的东西。当使徒侵入并连接那两者，直达核心时，它也在 EVA 之间传递信息，尤其是关于它们自身和孩子们的记忆。那一刻，它们成为一个单一的有机体。在初号机的情况下，攻击后其记忆构成发生了显著变化。"

"Why this hasn't been said before?"  
“为什么之前没人提起过？”

"I just found it out this morning, while looking at her maintenance logs. At that time the anomaly wasn't significant. They thought it was battle damage or a synaptic power surge, so the techs corrected it with some reprogramming."  
“我今早查看她的维护日志时才发现的。当时异常并不明显，他们以为是战斗损伤或神经电涌，所以技术人员通过重新编程进行了修正。”

"And once Rei went back to board Unit One again, that Eva went nuts and simply wrote back that information… Memories, I mean, into her, am I right?"  
“而当绫波再次登上初号机时，那台 Eva 就疯了，直接把那些信息——记忆，我是说，写进了她的大脑里，对吧？”

Natsumi nodded. "That's correct."  
夏美点头。"没错。"

Misato sighed. "It's another proof that our understanding about them is still small."  
美里叹了口气。"这再次证明我们对他们的了解还太少。"

"Yeah. Oh, by the way… Since there's no personal information on him, I'll try to run a DNA analysis on Kaworu's blood sample. That can take as little as one hour to scan the whole three billion bases alone."  
"是啊。哦，对了……既然他的个人信息不全，我打算对薰的血样进行 DNA 分析。这最快只需一小时就能扫描完整个三十亿碱基对。"

Three decades ago, a skilled geneticist can identify up to a thousand bases per day, yet it would take that scientist about 8,000 years to complete the entire human DNA sequence. But as technology progressed so was the speed of the DNA analyzers, taking thousands, then millions, and now billions of bases, cutting down the time to identify the bases. This enabled geneticists to easily identify genes that affected human health and physiological characteristics.  
三十年前，一位熟练的遗传学家每天能识别多达一千个碱基，但这位科学家需要大约 8000 年才能完成整个人类 DNA 序列。但随着技术的进步，DNA 分析仪的速度也在提升，从数千、数百万到现在的数十亿个碱基，大大缩短了识别碱基的时间。这使得遗传学家能够轻松识别影响人类健康和生理特征的基因。

Misato was astonished. "You have it? That's great, but why?"  
美里感到惊讶。"你有它？那太好了，但为什么？"

The young doctor picked up her bottle of Pocari Sweat and emptied it, before tossing the bottle into a wastebasket. "I'm curious as to what he really is."  
年轻医生拿起她的宝矿力水瓶，一饮而尽，然后将瓶子扔进了废纸篓。"我对他究竟是什么感到好奇。"

"Something suspicious? I have the same thoughts about him because the Committee sent him here."  
"有什么可疑的吗？我对他也有同样的想法，因为委员会把他派到这里来了。"

"Just a hunch, because when he's piloting, everything is child's play to him, and I'm sure you know this by now. Perfect every time. Great sync ratios unlike anything the other Children could ever hope to reach. Checking his genetic sequence might give us clues about his physical composition."  
"只是一种直觉，因为他驾驶时，对他来说一切都轻而易举，我相信你现在也知道这一点。每次都完美无缺。同步率之高，是其他孩子们望尘莫及的。检查他的基因序列可能会让我们了解他的身体构成。"

"I see. Get the analysis done, and then show the results only to _me_. Not to the Commander or anyone else. Then we'll try to explain all this to Fuyutsuki. Got it?"  
"我明白了。完成分析后，只把结果给我看。不要给指挥官或其他人看。然后我们再试着向冬月解释这一切。明白了吗？"

"Okay," Natsumi agreed. "Why trust the Sub-Commander?"  
“好吧，”娜兹美同意道，“为什么要信任副司令？”

"Because in my book, he's the sanest man at the top who could do something right, and could possibly even get us out of this jam."  
“因为在我的书里，他是高层中最理智的人，能做对事情，甚至有可能帮我们摆脱这个困境。”

On a bench, Kaworu was waiting, bidding his time. Earlier as they came along with Misato, who told them on what to do during the debriefing sessions, he talked to Rei while their superior officer was leading the way.  
在长椅上，渚薰正等待着，把握着时机。早些时候，他们和美里一起走来，美里告诉他们在简报会上该怎么做，他则在路上和绫波丽交谈。

"_I wish to ask something," Rei said._  
"我想问个问题," 丽说道。

_Kaworu looked back at the girl. "I beg your pardon?"  
薰回头看向女孩。"您说什么？"_

"_Can you tell me what those flowers are for?"_  
"你能告诉我这些花是用来做什么的吗？"

"_You mean the roses I brought in for you?"_  
"你是说那些我为你带进来的玫瑰吗？"

_Rei nodded. "Yes."_

"_It's to show that I care, and that you're special."_  
"这是为了表达我在乎你，你很特别。"

"_I thought they were useless," Rei answered._  
"我以为它们没什么用，" 丽回答道。"

_Kaworu frowned. "What do you mean?"  
渚薰皱了皱眉。“你是什么意思？”_

_Rei couldn't give out a reason why. "I confess that have no idea about flowers."  
绫波丽无法给出理由。“我承认我对花一无所知。”_

"_Well," Kaworu said, sighing for a second. "Flowers always have a purpose. Their universal beauty is well-appreciated even since before the beginning of civilization. And then where there are flowers, fruits and eventually seeds come next. That's how plant life flourishes. Otherwise we can smell their fragrant scent. No wonder why most people pay importance to flowers, and respect their fragile and delicate beauty, which is why they have even made paintings and wrote poems about them."_  
“嗯，”渚薰叹了口气说，“花总是有其目的的。它们普遍的美丽自古以来就备受赞赏。然后，有花的地方就会有果实，最终结出种子。这就是植物生命繁盛的方式。否则我们也能闻到它们芬芳的香气。难怪大多数人重视花朵，尊重它们脆弱而精致的美，这就是为什么他们甚至为花作画、写诗。”

_Rei gently nodded. "Now I understand."  
丽轻轻点头。“现在我明白了。”_

"_Thanks," Kaworu said, smiling a bit._  
“谢谢，”渚薰微微一笑。

_In return, the girl gave him a faint smile. "I also thank you for the flowers."  
作为回应，女孩给了他一个淡淡的微笑。“我也感谢你送的花。”_

Now he thought of his feelings towards Rei. Even now, he couldn't describe them except every time he sees or think about her, a throbbing feeling came up into his heart. _What was it? How could I know?_  
现在他思考着自己对丽的感觉。即便此刻，他也无法用言语形容，每次看到她或想到她时，心中总会涌起一阵悸动。那是什么？我怎会知道？

Misato came out of a door opposite of the debriefing room. "Sorry, we had a discussion with someone inside," she said, closing the door behind her.  
美里从与简报室相对的门里走了出来。“抱歉，我们刚才在里面和某人讨论，”她说着，关上了身后的门。

"With whom?" Kaworu asked.  
“和谁？”薰问道。

"Can't tell you now. Confidential, you see."  
"现在还不能告诉你。这是机密，明白吧。"

"Ah. I'm okay waiting here."

Misato glanced at her wristwatch. "Just a few more minutes, and it's your turn."  
美里瞥了一眼她的手表。“再过几分钟，就轮到你了。”

"Thank you, ma'am." Kaworu nodded as the lady officer went inside the debriefing room, before he returned to his thoughts, mind floating back on the day they faced the Commander, who was also arguing with the Sub-Commander. He wondered what was on the mind of Commander Ikari, and what his true intent was for Kaworu and Rei, other than the supposed purpose of the test.  
"谢谢您，女士。" 川篱点头致意，待女军官进入简报室后，他又陷入了沉思，思绪飘回到那天他们面对指挥官，而指挥官正与副指挥官争论的场景。他好奇碇司令心中所想，以及他对川篱和绫波除了测试目的之外的真实意图是什么。

Perhaps the Commander was trying to find a hidden power in Kaworu, and then exploit it. He remembered the man as saying that he wanted to record data while Kaworu used Unit-02.  
或许司令官正试图在渚薰身上发掘某种隐藏的力量，并加以利用。他记得那人曾说过，想在渚薰使用二号机时记录数据。

Then Kaworu remembered the Dummy Plug Plant, although he had never set his foot upon it before.  
随后，渚薰想起了 Dummy Plug 工厂，尽管他从未踏足过那里。

This prompted him to look into his vast catalog of images captured from Rei's mind and began to back-track her imaginary footsteps through the mind-boggling maze of the Geofront, locating doors, passageways, direction signs, and even the passwords to break into locks, until he built a three-dimensional map before his mind's gaze.  
这促使他深入自己从绫波的记忆中捕捉到的大量影像，开始沿着她在地下都市错综复杂的迷宫中虚构的足迹回溯，定位门扉、通道、指示牌，甚至破解锁具的密码，直至在他脑海中构建出一幅三维地图。

_It's down there,_ he thought, locating the plant near the center of Central Dogma.  
就在那儿，他想，找到了位于中央教条中心的那株植物。

But in the very bottom of this map, however, there was one huge door that he couldn't go inside, and when he tried he couldn't see what was behind it, so impenetrable and all he met was pure darkness, cold to the touch. He frowned.  
但在这张地图的最底部，有一扇巨大的门，他无法进入。当他尝试时，他看不到门后是什么，只有无法穿透的黑暗，触感冰冷。他皱起了眉头。

_What was inside this place that Rei could enter it, and yet I can't?  
这个地方里面到底有什么，丽可以进入，而我却不能？_

---

Misato took a deep breath and asked, "Were you able to control the Eva as she went out of control?"  
美里深吸了一口气，问道：“你能控制住初号机在她失控的时候吗？”

"No," Rei said. "As I have stated earlier, I lost consciousness."  
“不能，”绫波说，“正如我之前所说，我失去了意识。”

"And the next thing you saw once you woke up, Kaworu rescued you, am I correct?"  
“而你醒来后看到的下一件事，是薰救了你，我说的没错吧？”

"Yes."

"Okay… Before the test, what happened during the briefing? Anything significant?"  
"好吧……测试之前，简报会上发生了什么？有什么重要的吗？"

"They argued," Rei said, referring to Gendo and Fuyutsuki. "The Sub-Commander objected, saying it was dangerous to restart the Dummy Plug Project, but the Commander overruled him."  
"他们争论了，" 绫波说，指的是源堂和冬月。"副司令反对，说重启傀儡系统计划很危险，但司令否决了他。"

"Why?"

"He wanted to take advantage of an opportunity. He also thought that he could make me try again."  
"他想利用一个机会。他也认为可以让我再试一次。"

"Just like the previous compatibility test?"  
"就像之前的适配测试一样？"

"Yes."

Misato frowned. "Even if you have risked your life for it?"  
美里皱起眉头。"即使你为此冒了生命危险？"

The question caused Rei to hesitate for a moment, pondering. _I have put my life into the fulfillment of my duty. He considers me as important, but… But not my life. I want to value life and my existence. I do not want to make Ikari sad anymore._  
这个问题让绫波犹豫了一瞬，沉思着。我已将生命奉献于履行我的职责。他认为我很重要，但……但不是我的生命。我想珍视生命和我自己的存在。我不想再让碇伤心了。

"Yes. The Commander deems it as important to his work. He wishes to accomplish what he started."  
“是的。指挥官认为这对他的工作至关重要。他希望完成他开始的事情。”

The woman groaned. "Now there's one final question before we go: what does the Commander want from Nagisa?"  
女人呻吟了一声。“现在在我们出发前还有一个最后的问题：指挥官想要从渚薰那里得到什么？”

Misato could see Rei trying to find an answer, "I believe the Commander has found him useful, in the same way that I am. Therefore he was included in the test, to record his synch data," the girl said.  
美里看到绫波在努力寻找答案，“我相信指挥官发现他很有用，就像我一样。因此他被纳入测试，以记录他的同步数据，”女孩说道。

"Was he trying to use Nagisa's data to create a new Dummy Plug?"  
“他是在试图利用渚的数据来创造一个新的 Dummy Plug 吗？”

Rei shook her head. "I am not sure."  
绫波摇了摇头。“我不确定。”

Misato sighed, knowing that from the bits and pieces of information Rei gave to her, she was confident she could build a coherent picture of the Commander's intent, "Okay, I think that's all I can ask from you, Rei. You can stand up now."  
美里叹了口气，从绫波提供的零碎信息中，她确信自己能拼凑出司令的意图，“好吧，我想我能问的都问了，绫波。你现在可以起来了。”

Rei nodded as she rose from her chair. "Thank you, Major."  
丽点点头，从椅子上站起来。“谢谢你，少校。”

Misato picked up the remote control and pressed the Pause button again.  
美里拿起遥控器，再次按下了暂停键。

---

"For years, I thought of what Mom really looked like," Shinji said. "I don't even have a picture of her, and Father said that he didn't have one either. One time I even tried to search her picture on the Internet, but there's nothing about her, except I came upon a website."  
“多年来，我想象着妈妈到底长什么样，”真嗣说。“我连她的照片都没有，父亲也说他没有。有一次我甚至试图在网上搜索她的照片，但关于她的信息一无所有，除了我偶然发现的一个网站。”

"What site?" Asuka questioned.  
"什么网站？" 明日香问道。

"It's an alumni site listing the graduates of Kyoto University, where I found out that she had a doctor's degree in bioengineering. But no picture."  
"是一个京都大学的校友网站，列出了毕业生名单，我在那里发现她拥有生物工程学的博士学位。但没有照片。"

"Anything else?"

Shinji shook his head. "Nothing else about her, except it said she came from France."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"除了提到她来自法国之外，没有其他关于她的信息了。"

"Well, have you tried to contact the university?"  
"嗯，你尝试过联系大学吗？"

"I did by email… a year ago, but they said that they don't have her name on their records. They also said that the website hasn't been updated properly."  
"我通过电子邮件联系过……一年前，但他们说他们的记录里没有她的名字。他们还说网站没有正确更新。"

Asuka frowned. "That's weird."  
明日香皱了皱眉。“这很奇怪。”

The young man bit his lip. "I guess I just have to imagine her instead. All's left is a grave marker with her name on."  
年轻人咬了咬嘴唇。“我想我只能想象她的样子了。剩下的只有刻着她名字的墓碑。”

Silence settled on the couple, trying to guess what to talk about instead, until Asuka broke the impasse.  
两人陷入沉默，试图猜测该聊些什么来替代，直到明日香打破了僵局。

"How's Kaji's case?" she asked, referring to her now-dead crush.  
“加持的案子怎么样了？”她问道，指的是她已故的暗恋对象。

Shinji shrugged. "They're still investigating it. I'm sorry. But Misato's mad at Section Two because it's taking too long, and even now there were no suspects, she says."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“他们还在调查。对不起。但美里对第二课很生气，因为拖得太久了，而且她说，到现在还没有嫌疑人。”

"I'm sure she'll kill to finish it, because I felt she really loved him…" Asuka trailed.  
“我相信她会不惜一切代价完成这件事，因为我感觉她真的很爱他……”明日香若有所思地说。

"I know. It's just that she was also angry at herself for not saving him. She felt responsible for him."  
“我知道。只是她也在生自己的气，因为没有救他。她觉得自己对他负有责任。”

The girl sighed. "By the way, where's Misato?"  
女孩叹了口气。“对了，美里在哪里？”

"She's out there, debriefing Ayanami and Kaworu."  
“她在外面，正在向绫波和薰汇报情况。”

"Ah. What did you do with Misato last night?"  
“啊。你昨晚和美里做了什么？”

"W… We drank beer."  
"我…我们喝了啤酒。"

Asuka frowned. "What?" 明日香皱眉。"什么？"

"It was Misato's idea of bonding. Couldn't help it… Anyway, we had a very long conversation about each other. It was really my first time."  
"这是美里所谓的增进感情的方式。没办法拒绝…不过，我们聊了很多彼此的事情。那真的是我第一次。"

The redhead shook her head.  
红发女孩摇了摇头。

"She talked about her past," he said. "What she was doing at my age. Like me, she hated her father, who was obsessed with his work. Then she talked about Kaji, before we eventually went on to ourselves. I think we used up two six-packs before we passed out. I even puked."  
"她谈起了她的过去，"他说。"她在我这个年纪时的生活。和我一样，她讨厌她的父亲，他沉迷于工作。然后她谈到了加持，直到我们最终聊到自己。我想我们喝掉了两箱六罐装啤酒才醉倒。我甚至还吐了。"

"What? One round of beer would've brought you down," Asuka said.  
"什么？一轮啤酒就能把你放倒，"明日香说。"

"Strange, I was able to hold my drink throughout that evening."  
“奇怪，那晚我居然能一直保持清醒。”

"But you survived, anyway. Congratulations for breaking the age-twenty limit." Asuka laughed. "I wished I could've seen your face like that," she added.  
“但你还是撑过来了。恭喜你打破了二十岁的魔咒。”明日香笑着说，“真希望我当时能看到你那副表情，”她补充道。

Shinji meekly smiled. "Thanks."  
真嗣腼腆地笑了笑。“谢谢。”

Abruptly Asuka shuffled herself to the edge of her bed, legs first to the floor and tried to stand up. Surprised, Shinji went to the girl and held her upper arms, attempting to provide support. "Wait, what are you doing?" he gasped.  
突然，明日香挪到床边，双腿先着地，试图站起来。真嗣吃了一惊，走到她身边，扶住她的上臂，试图提供支持。“等等，你在做什么？”他喘着气问道。

"I want to see if I can walk," she answered as the girl began to make one slow step at a time.  
“我想试试能不能走路，”她回答道，女孩开始一步一步缓慢地移动。

"Let me guide you," Shinji said, still holding. "I don't want to let you fall."  
“让我扶着你，”真嗣说着，依然扶着她。“我不想让你摔倒。”

"O… Okay," Asuka blurted. _This time I'm giving him a chance, and I'm not going to use those stupid reverse psychology tricks._  
"哦… 好吧，" 明日香脱口而出。这次我要给他一个机会，而且我不会用那些愚蠢的反向心理战术。

The couple paced around the room for a few minutes until Asuka thought she could get her walking right. "Now, let me go for a while," she said. "I think I could feel my legs this time."  
这对情侣在房间里踱步了几分钟，直到明日香觉得自己能走得稳了。"现在，让我自己走一会儿，" 她说。"我觉得这次我能感觉到我的腿了。"

Shinji let go of her, and Asuka started to walk on her own, albeit slowly and carefully.  
真嗣松开了她，明日香开始自己慢慢而谨慎地走起来。

"Watch out," he warned, saw her wobbling.  
"小心点，"他警告道，看到她摇摇晃晃。

"I know!" Asuka shot back, a few more steps to go. "I can do it!"  
"我知道！"明日香回敬道，还有几步就到了。"我能做到！"

Shinji shook his head as he watched Asuka's progress, making another circuit. Seeing that she was able to stabilize herself and picking up the pace after a few minutes, he asked right in front of her, "How's it going?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，看着明日香继续绕圈。看到她几分钟后能稳定自己并加快步伐，他便在她面前问道："进展如何？"

Asuka can only laugh. "It's all right now!" she exclaimed, but then she suddenly tripped, pitching forward onto Shinji and they crashed to the floor together, her body flattening the poor boy.  
"明日香只能笑出声来。“现在一切都好了！”她喊道，但随即突然绊了一下，向前扑倒在真嗣身上，两人一起摔倒在地板上，她的身体压扁了可怜的男孩。”

"Oops," she said.

"A… Are you okay?" Shinji asked. Blush crept onto his cheeks, as he felt her chest against him. But he couldn't believe that this time she wasn't making a nasty reaction or playing hard to get; before, she would have slapped his face and calling him a pervert. He also remembered her saying, _"In my case, do you think my breasts might get bigger when they're warm?"_  
"“啊…你还好吗？”真嗣问道。脸颊泛起红晕，他感觉到她的胸部紧贴着自己。但他不敢相信这次她没有做出恶劣的反应或故作矜持；以前，她会扇他耳光并骂他是变态。他还记得她说过，“就我而言，你觉得我的胸部会不会在暖和的时候变大？””

In that quiet moment, Asuka looked into his eyes. "I'm okay," she said. "I'm sorry. Let's try it again."  
"在那宁静的时刻，明日香凝视着他的眼睛。“我没事，”她说。“对不起。我们再试一次吧。””

"What? Ah, you're right," he stammered as he watched Asuka get up onto her feet and she offered her hand to him. He took hold and Asuka pulled Shinji up.  
"什么？啊，你说得对，" 他结巴着，看着明日香站起身来，向他伸出手。他握住她的手，明日香将真嗣拉了起来。

"Thanks," he said as he watched the girl try to stretch her legs, wriggling toes and heels. He wondered what was pushing Asuka to walk again. Perhaps she was building up her courage to face another battlefront, a new life outside, without having to wear a plugsuit.  
"谢谢，" 他说着，看着女孩试图伸展双腿，扭动脚趾和脚跟。他不知道是什么在推动明日香再次行走。也许她正在鼓起勇气面对另一个战场，一个新的生活，不再需要穿着插入栓服。

"Maybe I'll try running later," Asuka said, once more walking around Shinji on a brisk pace. "What time is it?"  
"也许我晚点会试试跑步，" 明日香说，再次在真嗣周围快步走动。"现在几点了？"

Shinji checked his wristwatch. "It's a quarter till eleven," he said. "Why?"  
真嗣看了看手腕上的表。“十一点差一刻，”他说，“怎么了？”

"Do you have a cellphone with you?"  
“你带手机了吗？”

"Ah… yes," he said, quickly rummaging through his pockets and fished out a clamshell Casio phone. "Why? Do you want to call someone?"  
“啊……带了，”他迅速在口袋里翻找，掏出一个翻盖的卡西欧手机。“怎么了？你要打电话吗？”

"Yes, I want to talk to Hikari. You still have her number?"  
“是的，我想和光说话。你还有她的号码吗？”

Shinji nodded as he handed his cellphone to Asuka. "Yeah," he answered.  
真嗣点点头，将手机递给明日香。“嗯，”他回答道。

The girl began to press a few buttons, scrolling through the phonebook and then dialed Hikari's number. There were a few rings until she heard her friend pick it up.  
女孩开始按下几个按钮，翻阅着通讯录，然后拨打了光的号码。电话响了几声后，她听到了朋友接起的声音。

"Hello," Asuka greeted. “你好，”明日香问候道。

"Is…Is that you?" Hikari stuttered. "I thought it's Shinji on the line."  
“是…是你吗？”光 stammered。“我以为是真嗣在电话那头。”

"No, it's really me!" Asuka then laughed as she heard her pal scream her name, squeal in delight, and sobbing and chortling for a while until Hikari settled down.  
“不，真的是我！”明日香听到好友尖叫她的名字，兴奋地尖叫，又哭又笑，直到光平静下来，她才笑了起来。

"Where are you now?" Hikari asked, pausing to sniff. "I thought you're still hurt."  
"你现在在哪里？" 光问道，停下来吸了吸鼻子。"我以为你还受伤呢。"

"I'm down here in the Geofront. This time I'm okay, and Shinji's with me."  
"我在地底都市这里。这次我没事，真嗣也和我在一起。"

"Thank goodness, we were so worried about you! Same thing with Shinji and Rei. We had to evacuate the city a week ago, just after Toji almost bought it."  
"谢天谢地，我们都很担心你！真嗣和绫也是。一周前我们不得不撤离城市，就在东治差点出事之后。"

"I see," Asuka said. "Glad to hear all of you doing right. How are your sisters?"  
"我明白了，" 明日香说。"很高兴听到你们都过得不错。你的妹妹们呢？"

"They're on a double date right now. Toji's sister's still doing well, and Kensuke always keeps on watching war documentaries. Toji is supposed to get his new artificial arm this week or the next. By the way, if you're wondering about Pen-Pen…"  
"她们现在正在双人约会。冬二的妹妹还是老样子，健介一直在看战争纪录片。冬二这周或下周应该会拿到他的新义肢。对了，如果你想知道关于 Pen-Pen 的事……"

"Is that crazy bird with you? Still enjoying his sardines?"  
"那只疯鸟跟你在一起吗？还在享受他的沙丁鱼吗？"

"Well, yeah, he's finicky but I have no issue with him. He's still the same, although sometimes he misses Misato."  
"嗯，是啊，他有点挑剔，但我跟他没问题。他还是老样子，虽然有时候会想念美里。"

Asuka laughed as Shinji amusedly shook his head.  
明日香笑着，而真嗣则有趣地摇了摇头。

"Anyway…" Hikari said. "What are you going to do next?"  
"话说回来…" 光说。"你接下来打算做什么？"

The redhead paused for a moment. "I'm sorry but I have to go home. Back to Germany."  
红发女孩顿了顿。“对不起，但我必须回家。回到德国。”

"Oh." Hikari sounded disappointed.  
“哦。”光听起来很失望。

"I'm done in here. I'm quitting. My sync rate's really screwed-up so I can't use Unit Two anymore. Instead I want to be normal. Maybe I'll pursue on playing the violin."  
“我在这里已经结束了。我要辞职。我的同步率严重失调，所以不能再使用二号机了。相反，我想过正常的生活。也许我会继续追求拉小提琴。”

"A few months ago, everyone would've killed for such a job like yours," Hikari said.  
“几个月前，人人都巴不得有你这样的工作，”光说。

"Yes, that's right, but now… No, everyone's gonna get a really bad case of a reality check if they were in my shoes. That's the truth. Toji knows that."  
“是的，没错，但现在……不，如果他们处在我的位置，都会被现实狠狠打脸。这是事实。真治也知道。”

"Now that you're going back, how can you live once you're there?"  
“既然你要回去了，你到了那里怎么生活呢？”

Asuka sighed. "I don't know. Maybe I'll find new friends, but I can try to keep in touch with you guys. I don't forget."  
明日香叹了口气。“我不知道。也许我会找到新朋友，但我可以试着和你们保持联系。我不会忘记的。”

"I still have you on Facebook and on Mixi," Hikari said, referring to her accounts in both social networking websites. "Just in case."  
“我在 Facebook 和 Mixi 上还有你的账号，”光子说，指的是她在两个社交网站上的账户。“以防万一。”

The redhead chuckled. "Much thanks."  
红发女孩轻声笑了。“多谢了。”

"Um, I forgot to ask… How's Shinji, Misato and Rei?"  
"呃，我忘了问……真嗣、美里和绫波怎么样了？"

"They're all right, too."  
"他们也都还好。"

"That's good. I like you sounding much better this time, a little calm."  
"那就好。我喜欢你这次听起来好多了，稍微平静些。"

"Sure is, especially when I realized that I made too many mistakes. Guess today I have to come clean."  
"确实如此，尤其是当我意识到自己犯了很多错误。看来今天我得坦白了。"

"You're right," Hikari agreed. "Um, anyway… I heard from Shinji that you guys have a new friend."  
"你说得对，"光同意道。"嗯，对了…我从真嗣那里听说你们有了新朋友。"

"You mean that Nagisa boy?"  
"你是说那个叫渚的男孩吗？"

"Well, yeah, that's his name, although I have yet to see him. I also heard that he's sticking with Rei. Is that true?"  
"嗯，是的，那是他的名字，不过我还没见过他。我还听说他一直和丽在一起。这是真的吗？"

"I think so," Asuka said. "Last time I saw him, he was with her most of the time because she got into a testing accident and had to get well in the Infirmary."  
"我想是的，"明日香说。"上次我见到他时，他大部分时间都和她在一起，因为她遭遇了测试事故，不得不在医务室休养。"

"What?" Hikari exclaimed.  
"什么？" 美里惊呼道。"

"Hey, nothing serious," Asuka reassured. "Just a bruise on her. I checked on the Wondergirl this morning. Had a little chat. No rivalry this time… I think we're on good terms now."  
"嘿，没什么大不了的，" 明日香安慰道。"只是有点淤青。我今早去看过那个小天使了，聊了几句。这次没闹别扭……我想我们现在关系挺好的。"

The girl on the other end sounded relieved. "Oh, I see. Thank God."  
电话那头的女孩听起来松了口气。"哦，那就好。谢天谢地。"

"That Nagisa guy's been here for a few days."  
"那个叫渚的家伙已经在这儿待了几天了。"

"I see. Is he really nice?"  
"我明白了。他真的很好吗？"

"Way beyond it. So polite. Sometimes he makes jokes about himself, but all in all, he's a real looker, except I think he's pulling Rei out of the freezer."  
"远远超过。非常有礼貌。有时候他会自嘲，但总的来说，他是个真正的帅哥，不过我觉得他在把丽从冷冻室里拉出来。"

Hikari laughed. "The poor girl," she said. "But she's lucky. He must be a prince."  
光笑了。“可怜的女孩，”她说。“但她很幸运。他一定是个王子。”

"Yeah, she even got roses from him. Fresh white ones in a bouquet... don't know where he picked them up. They looked expensive."  
"是啊，他还送了她玫瑰花。新鲜的白色玫瑰，一束束的...不知道他从哪儿弄来的。看起来挺贵的。"

"Oh, that's quite thoughtful," Hikari praised. "Anything else?"  
"哦，那真是挺细心的，"光称赞道。"还有别的吗？"

"The only odd thing about Kaworu is that he wondered what dating was all about. I gave him a lecture on it, because I went through one. He admitted he hasn't experienced a date in his whole life, so I think he might have been living in some cave. Anyway, he wants to try dating Rei."  
"关于渚最奇怪的一点是，他居然好奇约会是什么感觉。我给他讲了一通，因为我有过经历。他承认自己这辈子都没约过会，所以我猜他可能一直住在某个山洞里。不管怎样，他想尝试和丽约会。"

"Really?"

"Yeah, and he means it. He also said he wants to learn first before diving in."  
"是啊，他是认真的。他还说想先学习一下再深入。"

"Okay… It's all right if he wants his first time."  
"好吧……如果他想第一次尝试，那也没关系。"

Asuka sighed, shaking her head. "It's too bad that I have to go… would've been interesting to get to know more about them the second time around."  
明日香叹了口气，摇了摇头。 "真可惜我得走了……第二次有机会了解更多他们的话，应该会很有趣。"

"When you'll be back?"  
"你什么时候回来？"

"I don't know… Maybe someday when things get better for me I'll drop by."  
"我不知道……也许有一天，当我情况好转时，我会顺道拜访。"

"I hope so."

"By the way," Asuka said. "I think I may have to eat lunch after this, and then I'm going."  
"顺便说一句，"明日香说。"我想我可能得在这之后吃午饭，然后我就走了。"

"Ah, okay. Love you sister," Hikari said. "Be a little careful, right?"  
"啊，好的。爱你，姐姐，" 光说。"小心点，好吗？"

"I know. I love you, too. Bye! Auf Wiedersehen! I'll call you back later on the plane!"  
"我知道。我也爱你。再见！再见！我会在飞机上给你回电话的！"

"Goodbye! I'll see you again! Ja ne!"  
"再见！我们会再见面的！再见！"

As soon Hikari hung up, Asuka snapped the phone back and handed it to Shinji. "How did it go?" the boy asked, pocketing the phone.  
光一挂断电话，明日香就啪地一声把手机合上，递给了真嗣。“怎么样？”男孩一边把手机放进口袋一边问道。

"Well… I feel much better," she said, a beatific expression on her face. "Thank you, Shinji."  
“嗯……我感觉好多了，”她脸上带着幸福的表情说道，“谢谢你，真嗣。”

As he stood up from his seat, Kaworu watched Rei and Misato come out of the room. The girl was in her usual calm demeanor, so he asked, "How did it go?"  
当他从座位上站起来时，薰看着丽和美里从房间里走出来。女孩一如既往地平静，于是他问道：“怎么样？”

"It was normal," Rei said, the girl sitting down onto the bench. "Only some important questions."  
"这是正常的，" 丽说道，女孩坐到了长椅上。"只是一些重要的问题。"

Misato nodded at Kaworu. "It's your turn," she said, and led him into the room.  
美里向渚点头示意。"轮到你了，"她说着，带他进入了房间。

As the door closed behind them and she sat onto the bench, Rei felt mildly relieved and then she sank into her thoughts about the roses, white petals intricately nestled in layers, opening outwards.  
随着门在他们身后关闭，她坐到长椅上，丽感到一丝轻微的宽慰，然后她沉浸在对玫瑰的思考中，白色的花瓣错综复杂地叠在一起，向外绽放。

_If he says that flowers are delicate and fragile, he knows that I am special. He thinks that I am comparable to a flower.  
如果他说花朵是娇嫩而脆弱的，他知道我是特别的。他认为我可以与一朵花相媲美。_

Rei's mind wandered to the cryptic "poem" she recited to herself months ago, and then recalled Kaworu's earlier explanation.  
丽的心思飘向了数月前她自言自语念叨的那段隐晦的“诗句”，随后又想起了薰之前的解释。

_A flower may be useless, if I look at it, but Kaworu is otherwise right. It has a purpose. It lives. It gives life... the seeds of life, and it nourishes.  
一朵花或许在我看来是无用的，但薰说得没错。它有其存在的意义。它活着。它赋予生命……生命的种子，它滋养着。_

_That makes the flower very special.  
那使得这朵花非常特别。_

---

After Misato read Kaworu's rights and the purpose of the debriefing, and the Fifth Children stated his name, rank and service number, she asked him to narrate what happened on that day. Step-by-step, he explained the sequence of events, from initiation to the unexpected rejection; he was then ordered to stop Unit-01 until he put that Eva out of commission and rescued Rei.  
在美里宣读了渚薰的权利和审讯的目的后，第五适格者报上了自己的姓名、军衔和服务编号，她要求他叙述那天发生的事情。他一步步解释了事件的经过，从开始到意外的拒绝；随后他被命令停止初号机，直到他将那台 EVA 报废并救出绫波。

"She was unconscious when I pulled her out," Kaworu said.  
“我救她出来时，她已经昏迷了，”渚薰说道。

Misato nodded. "Go on."  
美里点头。"继续。"

"I thought she drowned, so I immediately administered resuscitation, and she recovered."  
"我以为她溺水了，所以我立刻进行了复苏，她便恢复了。"

"Good. Okay, can you tell me what else you have noticed during the incident?"  
"很好。好的，你能告诉我你在事件中还注意到了什么吗？"

Kaworu thought for a moment. "The Bakelite dispensers didn't work. If I'm right, having read the standard manual on Eva testing procedures, they should always be ready during a test, to be used in case of emergency."  
渚薰思索片刻。“那些酚醛塑料释放器没有起作用。如果我没记错，根据 EVA 测试程序的标准手册，它们在测试期间应始终处于待命状态，以备紧急情况使用。”

"That's true, and the emergency plug ejection system should've also kicked in to save her, but it didn't, and as you said you went manual override to get her out."  
“确实如此，紧急插头弹射系统本应启动来救她，但它没有，正如你所说，你采取了手动覆盖操作来救她。”

"Yes, that is correct."  
“是的，没错。”

"Now… Let's go on to a different question: it may be redundant to ask now, but how Unit Two responded to you on the first time?"  
"现在…让我们转到另一个问题：现在问可能有些多余，但二号机第一次对你的反应如何？"

"It was normal, like as if I was wearing a second skin. I managed to be in full control."  
"很正常，就像我穿了第二层皮肤一样。我完全掌控了局面。"

Misato scribbled notes. "Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary while inside that Eva, in the Entry Plug?"  
美里做着笔记。“你在驾驶舱内，有没有注意到任何异常情况？”

"Not much, except there's a trace of Asuka's scent inside." He knew this because Asuka was apparently wearing too much baby cologne on missions before he came here; maybe she was trying to tone down the odor of LCL.  
“没什么特别的，只是里面有明日香的气味。”他之所以知道这一点，是因为在他来这里之前，明日香在执行任务时显然喷了太多婴儿香水；也许她是想掩盖 LCL 的气味。

"I see… What else?"

Kaworu thought of answering it, that Unit-02's soul retreated upon his presence, submitting to his will, but he gave Misato a different answer. "I guess I have nothing else to say."  
Kaworu 本想回答说，二号机的灵魂在他出现时退缩了，屈服于他的意志，但他给了美里一个不同的答案。“我想我没什么别的可说了。”

---

Asuka was just finished talking to the nurse via intercom, requesting that someone should empty her locker and bring its contents to her in a box, including some spare clothes for her to wear.  
明日香刚刚通过对讲机与护士交谈完毕，要求有人清空她的储物柜，并将里面的物品装在一个盒子里送到她那里，包括一些备用衣物供她更换。

"You said Kaworu talked to you," Shinji spoke.  
"你说渚薰跟你谈过话，" 真嗣说道。

"Yeah," Asuka said. "I told him almost everything, but the hairy thing about him… it seemed that he knew my past."  
"嗯，" 明日香说。"我几乎把所有事都告诉他了，但他那神秘的地方……似乎他知道我的过去。"

The young man scratched his head in askance. "How come?"  
年轻人困惑地挠了挠头。"怎么会这样？"

"I don't know how he did it, but I think he has this power. No, maybe he went through my records, and only a few people really know who I am behind the façade."  
“我不知道他是怎么做到的，但我觉得他拥有这种力量。不，也许他查看了我的档案，只有少数人真正知道我背后的真实身份。”

Shinji frowned. "What power? You mean he's unusual, or he has some abilities? I don't understand, but why?"  
真嗣皱起眉头。“什么力量？你是说他与众不同，还是他有什么特殊能力？我不明白，但为什么？”

Asuka paused for a moment. "You may not believe this, but… He appeared to me in my dreams last night, before I woke up."  
明日香停顿了一下。“你可能不会相信，但是……昨晚在我醒来之前，他出现在我的梦里。”

The boy was flabbergasted. "What?"  
男孩目瞪口呆。“什么？”

"I'm not joking, okay? The dream looked all too real, and I found myself talking to him. He said he knew everything about me." Asuka then described the vivid details to Shinji, who looked perplexed.  
“我不是在开玩笑，好吗？那个梦看起来太真实了，我发现自己在和他交谈。他说他对我了如指掌。”明日香接着向真嗣描述了那些生动的细节，真嗣看起来一脸困惑。

"I couldn't believe it," he said, frowning.  
“我简直不敢相信，”他皱着眉说。

"I know you can't, because I'm probably the only one to experience it. He said he came from Germany, right?"  
"我知道你无法理解，因为这经历可能只有我一个人有过。他说他来自德国，对吧？"

"Yeah."

"Didn't tell you anything else?"  
"没告诉你别的什么吗？"

Shinji shrugged. "No, he was keeping much to himself, I guess. Just like Ayanami."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。 "没有，他很多事情都藏在心里，我想。就像绫波一样。"

"Still," Asuka said, trying to stretch her legs, "I really like him, even if he's here for a few days. Apart from making moves on Rei, what else he did while I was absent?"  
"不过嘛，" 明日香说着，试图伸展双腿，"我真的很喜欢他，即使他只在这里待几天。除了对丽动手动脚，我不在的时候他还做了什么？"

"Since he's an official pilot, naturally he needs to be tested, and he made a very good sync rate."  
"既然他是正式驾驶员，自然需要接受测试，他的同步率非常高。"

"How much?" Asuka demanded.  
"有多高？" 明日香追问道。"

"If I could remember… it's around seventy percent... No, seventy-five!"  
"如果我能记得……大概是百分之七十……不，七十五！"

Asuka's jaw dropped completely. "WHAT?" she screeched. "Shit… that's a sick percentage!"  
明日香的嘴巴完全张大了。"什么？"她尖叫道。"该死……这百分比太惊人了！"

"That's from his first normal test, synching to your Eva, and he wasn't bluffing," Shinji said, but then he took note of Asuka's shocked expression. "I thought you wanted to forget about sync rates. Why bother again?"  
"这是他第一次常规测试，与你的 Eva 同步率，他没有吹牛，"真嗣说，但随后他注意到了明日香震惊的表情。"我以为你不想再提同步率了。为什么又在意起来了？"

"B… But it's too hard to reach such a figure," she stammered. "You've gone to the limit the last time, you're the only one who punched to 400%, and that was only when you went on berserker mode before Unit One turned you into goo."  
"但……但这数字太高了，难以达到。" 她结结巴巴地说，"上次你已经拼尽全力，唯一一次打出 400%的输出，还是在狂暴模式下，直到一号单位把你打成一滩泥。"

"I know. He can also fight and shoot his way through as if it's almost a video game."  
"我知道。他还能像在玩电子游戏一样，一边战斗一边射击。"

"What the heck he is, anyway? And who selected him in the first place?"  
"他到底是什么人？又是谁最初选中他的？"

Shinji merely shrugged. "I don't really know, except Kaworu has the best of everything and anything my father wanted in an Eva pilot, but I'm not backing down just because he's almost perfect. Fortunately for us, he's not the kind who would throw his weight around and scare everyone."  
真嗣只是耸了耸肩。“我也不太清楚，只知道律子拥有父亲想要的一切，以及任何在 Eva 驾驶员身上的优点，但我不会仅仅因为他几乎完美就退缩。幸运的是，他不是那种会仗势欺人、吓唬大家的人。”

"Well… On second thought," Asuka said, her composure returned. "Kaworu's massive sync rate doesn't mean he's not my friend this time."  
“嗯……再想想，”明日香恢复了镇定，说道，“律子的高同步率并不意味着这次他就不是我的朋友了。”

Suddenly they heard a knock on the door, and then Nurse Chigusa's head peeked out.  
突然，他们听到敲门声，随后千草护士的头探了出来。

"Pardon me," the nurse said. "It's really important."  
"劳驾，" 护士说道，"这真的很重要。"

"What is it?" Asuka asked.  
"什么事？" 明日香问道。"

"Miss Langley, better get ready for your final examination," she announced. "Doctor Odani's waiting for you."  
"兰格利小姐，准备好你的期末考试吧，" 她宣布道，"尾谷医生在等你。"

---

Misato looked bored, yawning, as it was obvious that the two Children almost had the same story, so she made a decision in dire need of a lunch break.  
美里看起来很无聊，打着哈欠，显然两个孩子几乎有着相同的故事，于是她急需午餐休息时间，做出了一个决定。

"Looks like we can finish right here," she said, sandwiching her notes into a folder before pressing the Stop button on the remote. "Are you hungry?"  
“看来我们可以在这里结束了，”她说着，将笔记夹进文件夹，然后按下了遥控器上的停止键。“你饿了吗？”

Kaworu shook his head. "Not yet," he said. "Everything I said, that's as far as I know."  
渚摇了摇头。“还不饿，”他说。“我所说的，就是我所知道的一切。”

"What about tonight, and perhaps we go out for dinner at home?" Misato suggested as she stood up and ejected the SD flash memory card from the camera and pocketed it. "Just that we have something to discuss off-the-record. You and me."  
"今晚怎么样，或许我们可以在家吃个晚饭？" 美里提议道，她站起身来，从相机中取出 SD 闪存卡，放进口袋。"只是我们有些私下要讨论的事情。你和我。"

"Good. I don't think I'll be having anything else to do today," he said, standing up from his seat. "Besides, I have a few things to talk about with you, and I was waiting for a chance.'  
"好啊。我想我今天也没别的事了，" 他说着，从座位上站起来。"而且，我有些事情想和你谈谈，一直在等机会。"

Misato then glanced at the ceiling, an idea forming in her mind. "Say, why don't you ask Rei to come along with us for lunch? Once I leave you two alone, you can have an opportunity to have some private time with her."  
美里随后瞥了一眼天花板，心中冒出一个主意。"对了，你为什么不邀请绫波和我们一起吃午饭呢？等我离开后，你们俩就有机会单独相处了。"

Kaworu smiled. "Thank you. It would be just right."  
渚薰微笑道：“谢谢你。这样正好。”

"Well, yes. Woman's intuition tells me that you're wishing for it."  
“嗯，是的。女人的直觉告诉我，你心里是这么想的。”

The young man chuckled, but then thought of something else, and voiced it. "Maybe… First, I'd like to see where Rei actually lives."  
年轻人轻笑一声，随即又想到了什么，便说了出来。“或许……首先，我想看看绫波真正住的地方。”

"Her home?"

"Yes."

Misato shrugged. "It's not far from the nearest gate. She lives in a flat, except it's almost a slum. A risky place for her to live in, but her apartment block's the only safe building down there."  
美里耸了耸肩。“离最近的门不远。她住在一个公寓里，虽然那儿几乎是个贫民窟。对她来说是个危险的地方，但她的公寓楼是那儿唯一安全的建筑。”

"I see. I'm really curious."  
“我明白了。我真的很感兴趣。”

Misato opened the door and Rei was there, who stood up for them. Kaworu asked, "I wish to visit your home."  
美里打开门，丽已经在那里站着等他们了。薰问道：“我想去你家看看。”

"Why?" Rei inquired. "为什么？" 丽询问道。

"Just to know how do you live."  
"只是想知道你是如何生活的。"

"If you want to, I can lead you there," Rei said. "I must also inspect the house. We could also have some tea."  
"如果你愿意，我可以带你去，" 丽说。"我也需要检查一下房子。我们还可以喝点茶。"

Kaworu smiled. "Makes good sense. You've been here for more than a day. By the way, would you like to join us for lunch first?"  
渚薰微笑道：“很有道理。你已经在这里待了一天多了。顺便问一下，要不要先和我们一起吃午饭？”

Rei nodded. "It would be fine," she said, before Kaworu and Misato heard something unearthly. Kaworu cocked an eye in askance, but Misato was blinking.  
绫波零点点头。“可以的，”她说，随后渚薰和美里听到了一些超自然的声音。渚薰斜眼看着，但美里却在眨眼。

"That's a first for you, I think," she remarked, a sweatdrop forming upon her head.  
“我想这是你第一次遇到这种情况，”她评论道，额头上冒出了汗珠。

It was the sound of Rei's stomach, growling empty, and the First Children had a slight blush on her otherwise-pale cheeks.  
那是丽肚子饿得咕咕叫的声音，这位第一适格者原本苍白的脸颊上泛起了一丝红晕。

Halfway around the world, in Keel Lorenz's office, a uniformed man stood in attention before him.  
在地球的另一端，基尔·洛伦兹的办公室里，一名身着制服的男子正笔直地站在他面前。

Ramrod-straight in his military bearing, the man had a crew cut, wearing digital camouflage fatigues and a Colt Model 1911 pistol in his belt holster. His face was chiseled like granite, his blue-gray eyes were alert and intelligent, but the man's army-cut hair was gray with age. A graduate of West Point, he'd seen elite military service for twenty years, under the aegis of the US Army's Delta Force, then ten years more for SEELE, acting as a chief operating officer of a large private military corporation (PMC) that the secretive organization operated as a business front.  
他军姿挺拔，留着平头，身穿数码迷彩服，腰间的枪套里插着一把柯尔特 M1911 手枪。他的面容如雕刻般坚毅，蓝灰色的眼睛机警而聪慧，但军人的短发已染上了岁月的灰白。作为西点军校的毕业生，他在美国陆军三角洲部队的庇护下，为精英军事服务了二十年，之后又在 SEELE 旗下担任了十年，作为一家大型私人军事公司（PMC）的首席运营官，这家公司是该秘密组织用作商业掩护的企业。

"I know you signed up for this a long time ago," Keel said, who was almost finished reading a report in a folder in his gnarled hands.  
"我知道你很久以前就报名参加了这个，"基尔说，他几乎已经读完了手中皱巴巴文件夹里的一份报告。

"That's right, sir," the man responded, his voice almost raspy. "My cancer just gave me twelve months left to live, but I'd like to make the most of what's left. I'd rather go down fighting than looking like shit on bed as the padre reads out the last rites."  
"没错，长官，"那人回答，声音几乎有些沙哑。"我的癌症刚刚给了我十二个月的生命，但我希望能充分利用剩下的时间。我宁愿在战斗中倒下，也不愿像一摊烂泥一样躺在床上，让牧师念诵最后的仪式。"

Keel tabled the folder onto the desk. He didn't mind the Colonel's brusque manner, understanding that the military man was an efficient destroyer. "Colonel, what's the current status of your assault force?" he inquired.  
基尔把文件夹放在桌子上。他不介意上校的粗鲁态度，明白这位军人是个高效的毁灭者。"上校，你的突击部队的当前状态如何？"他询问道。

"They're still in training, reviewing every detail of the entire Geofront complex. Whoever designed the whole place seemed to have overdone it with too many passageways, but it's better than those caves in Afghanistan."  
他们仍在训练中，仔细审查整个 Geofront 综合体的每一个细节。设计这个地方的人似乎过于注重通道的数量，但总比阿富汗的那些洞穴要好。

Keel nodded. "What else?"  
基尔点了点头。“还有什么？”

The Colonel coughed, but he took a breath and continued. "We undertook a detailed review of vital personnel we would eliminate, and then discussed the methods of destroying any opposition we face, even those unarmed. Security forces are a pain in the ass, however, as it depends on their disposition and morale, but judging from further reports and good intel from the inside, they're easy to deal with because they limited their budget, and therefore the size of their armory. They're capable of warding off small-size terrorist attacks, but they can be destroyed by a hard-core military division."  
上校咳嗽了一声，但他深吸一口气继续说道。“我们对需要清除的关键人员进行了详细审查，然后讨论了摧毁我们所面对的任何抵抗的方法，即使是那些未武装的。安全部队是个麻烦，这取决于他们的部署和士气，但从进一步的报告和内部的良好情报来看，他们很容易对付，因为他们限制了预算，因此武器库的规模也有限。他们能够抵御小型恐怖袭击，但可以被一支核心的军事部队摧毁。”

"Go on," Keel said. "I personally had their security budget pared down."  
"继续，"基尔说，"我亲自削减了他们的安保预算。"

"Their defense systems are powerful, but limited to large targets such as those Angels. They have good surveillance and early-warning systems, though, but we can nullify them by going low under the radar, then use EMP weapons mounted on the Dragons, destroy the defenses before going in for the kill. The SSDF would do the rest, though, with scorched-earth policy through their heavy arsenal even if they're actually cannon fodder."  
"他们的防御系统虽然强大，但仅限于大型目标，比如那些天使。不过，他们的监控和预警系统倒是不错，但我们可以通过低空飞行避开雷达，然后利用龙式战机上的 EMP 武器摧毁防御，再进行致命一击。SSDF 会负责剩下的，尽管他们实际上只是炮灰，但会用重型武器实施焦土政策。"

Keel knew that the Russian-French-built C-21 Dragons were the largest VTOL aircraft ever built, whose military purpose was to deliver a massive amount of destruction and then bring in a fully-equipped assault force in large numbers in its cargo hold. Only the old man and the Colonel knew where this assault force was located, but was no more than an hour of flying time to reach Japan.  
基尔知道，俄法联合建造的 C-21 龙式战机是迄今为止最大的垂直起降飞机，其军事目的是投放大量破坏性武器，然后在其货舱中运送大批全副武装的突击部队。只有老将军和上校知道这支突击部队的位置，但从那里飞到日本不超过一小时。

"However, I think you know whose life we should spare for the purpose of our ascension."  
"然而，我想您知道为了我们的晋升，应该饶过谁的生命。"

The Colonel nodded. "Yes, sir. Only one… This Shinji Ikari boy you talked about. How about Kaworu Nagisa that you've sent there?"  
上校点头。"是的，长官。只有一个…您提到的那个碇真嗣男孩。那您派去的渚薰呢？"

"He's preparing everything for us, to see how they react, and where they are vulnerable."  
"他在为我们准备一切，观察他们的反应，找出他们的弱点。"

"Like a Trojan horse, they'll never know what'll hit them."  
"就像特洛伊木马，他们永远不会知道会遭遇什么。"

"His sacrifice would be worth it, and from there we proceed as planned. Anyway, how do you feel now that you're part of this, Colonel Miles Quaritch?"  
"他的牺牲将是值得的，从那里我们将按计划进行。无论如何，你现在成为其中一员，感觉如何，迈尔斯·夸里奇上校？"

Quaritch grinned. "I'm ready, Mister Chairman," he said, before lighting up a cigar he had in his left pocket, a genuine Cohiba. "I can't wait to see the day… However, sir, there's something for you to know."  
夸里奇咧嘴一笑。“我准备好了，主席先生，”他说着，从左口袋里掏出一根真正的科希巴雪茄点燃。“我迫不及待想看到那一天……不过，先生，有件事您需要知道。”

"I beg your pardon, Colonel?"  
"请再说一遍，上校？"

"Mister Lorenz, I've been through many wars," Quaritch said, smoke floating around his head, "paid and fought well, but no amount of money, power or tons of medicines in this world would ever defeat Death. We're lucky to survive this far, what with some people going after my neck, while others want me to do their dirty work, but certainly soon we're sure that you and I will have our numbers up. As for me, I'm the delivery service for the Reaper, and I don't regret doing the job, even if I could get to see the man himself in the end."  
"洛伦兹先生，我经历过许多战争，"夸里奇说道，烟雾缭绕在他头顶，"无论是金钱、权力还是这世上无数的药物，都无法战胜死亡。我们能活到现在算是幸运了，有人想置我于死地，也有人让我去做肮脏的勾当，但很快我们都会面临自己的命运。对我来说，我是死神的快递员，即使最终能见到他本人，我也不后悔这份工作。"

Quaritch pulled a drag at his cigar, and then exhaled a stream of Cuban smoke. His doctor warned him, but what the hell, better enjoy the simple pleasures while still living and up on two feet.  
夸里奇抽了一口雪茄，然后吐出一缕古巴烟雾。尽管医生警告过他，但管他呢，活在当下，享受简单的快乐才是正道。

"I'd like to be there when we would make it happen, my way and yours. Fire and steel."  
"我希望能在我们实现它的那一刻在场，以我的方式和你的方式。烈火与钢铁。"

Keel nodded. "Very well said," he agreed, before the old man slowly stood up. "Since I believe that you have so much to work on, you may go check on your preparations, Colonel. Thank you for your time."  
基尔点了点头。“说得好极了，”他赞同道，随后老人缓缓站起身。“既然我相信你有很多事情要处理，上校，你可以去检查你的准备工作了。感谢你的时间。”

"Thank you, sir." Colonel Quaritch snapped a very smart salute, pivoted and walked out of the office.  
"谢谢您，长官。" 夸里奇上校利落地敬了一个标准的军礼，转身走出了办公室。

Once he was alone, Keel wondered what his angelic representative was doing in Tokyo-3 right now. He was hoping that Kaworu was acting on his plans, but also hoping that the young man wasn't doing anything contrary to his vision.  
独自一人时，基尔不禁思索他的天使代表此刻在东京-3 究竟在做什么。他既希望渚薰能按照他的计划行事，又担心这位年轻人做出与他愿景相悖的事。

The long-haired Shigeru Aoba was on his way to Asuka's room in the Infirmary, pushing a trolley laden with a box of her belongings from the locker in the Eva pilot's ready room. Fuyutsuki gave him the job after the nurse relayed the request from the girl, and he thought it a welcome respite from his tedious routine at the command bridge.  
长发飘飘的青叶茂正推着一辆装满物品的手推车，前往医务室中的明日香房间。这些物品是从 EVA 驾驶员准备室里的储物柜中取出的她的私人物品。在护士转达了明日香的请求后，副司令冬月将这项任务交给了他，青叶觉得这倒是逃离指挥桥上枯燥日常的一个好机会。

He thought it disappointing that after all the time she tried her best being a pilot and she fell down from her high pedestal, Asuka was now calling it quits.  
他感到失望，尽管明日香一直竭尽全力作为驾驶员，如今却从高高的位置跌落，选择放弃，这一切的努力似乎都白费了。

"Fallen so far, and so hard," he told himself, before launching into a whistling version of "Knockin' on Heaven's Door". As he whistled, his mind made musical associations: Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and then Guns and Roses. He knew the story, a sheriff grown weary of his duty, probably overwhelmed by outlaws, disease and age, decided to dispose of his badge and pistols, knowing he was about to die.  
“坠落得如此之深，如此之重，”他自言自语，随即吹起了《敲响天堂之门》的口哨版本。随着口哨声，他的思绪跳跃到音乐联想：鲍勃·迪伦、埃里克·克莱普顿，然后是枪与玫瑰乐队。他知道这个故事，一个疲惫不堪的警长，可能被不法之徒、疾病和衰老压垮，决定抛弃他的徽章和手枪，知道自己即将死去。

Shigeru knew of Asuka's plight, and in a sense it was like the old sheriff's fate. She lost the battle, went down hard, her heart broken, and tried to kill herself. But today he wondered what she was doing right now, as the girl was clearly preparing to leave this town, probably never to return again.  
碇真嗣知道明日香的困境，从某种意义上说，这就像那位老警长的命运。她战败了，重重地倒下，心碎欲绝，甚至试图自杀。但今天他好奇她现在在做什么，因为女孩显然准备离开这个城镇，可能再也不会回来了。

His mind wandered to other things, like what he would like to do when his tour of duty ends after the possible defeat of the last Angel. This they talked about with his other bridge buddies.  
他的思绪飘向其他事情，比如在可能击败最后一个使徒后，他的服役结束时想做些什么。这些话题他和他的其他驾驶员伙伴们讨论过。

"_Say, I wonder what you two are going to do once we're done," Makoto said to Maya and Shigeru, who were nursing their mugs of coffee. "In my case," he added, "I think either I'll apply for a new job doing analysis work or become a teacher. I'd like to have some peace of mind after all this. How about you?"_  
"说起来，你们俩完成之后打算做什么呢？" 真琴对正在啜饮咖啡的麻耶和茂说道。"至于我嘛，" 他补充道，"我想要么申请一份新的分析工作，要么去当老师。经历了这么多，我希望能有些平静。你们呢？"

_Makoto was looking at Maya.  
真琴看着麻耶。_

"_Me? Uh… I'll go on working on supercomputers, or apply for a job at CERN," she said._  
"我？呃…我会继续从事超级计算机的工作，或者申请去欧洲核子研究组织（CERN）工作，" 她回答道。

_Shigeru frowned. "CERN? That's a long shot, and I believe there's a long waiting list for applicants unless you have a very long list of recommendations."  
茂皱了皱眉。“CERN？那可是个远大的目标，而且我相信申请者名单很长，除非你有非常多的推荐信。”_

_Maya shrugged. "I know, but otherwise I'll be fine doing work at a small computer company, or if I really liked to enjoy working on what I love, start a small business designing and selling cat-themed merchandise."  
真由耸耸肩。“我知道，但除此之外，我也可以在一家小型电脑公司工作，或者如果我真的喜欢做自己喜欢的事，可以开一家小店设计并销售以猫为主题的商品。”_

_Makoto laughed. "It's okay starting small. You'll earn big from it. Girls still love cute stuff."  
诚笑了。“从小做起也没关系。你会从中赚大钱的。女孩们还是喜欢可爱的东西。”_

"_Okay," Shigeru cut in. "As for me, I guess joining a band would be nice. I've wanted to make the best of my guitar. It's not good to see that Stratocaster sitting around for too long."_  
"好吧，" 茂打断道，"至于我，加入一个乐队倒是不错。我一直想充分利用我的吉他。那把 Stratocaster 放太久可不好。"

"_Ah…" Maya said. "What kind of band you want to join? There's so many of them."_  
"啊…" 真由说，"你想加入什么样的乐队？有很多种呢。"

"_A cover band might be okay, but I'd like to join a real one. Heck, I even have some original compositions."_  
"翻唱乐队或许可以，但我更想加入一个真正的乐队。说真的，我甚至有一些原创作品。"

"_Can I hear one of them, even if you don't have a guitar with you?" Maya asked._  
"即使你没有带吉他，我能听一首吗？" 真弥问道。

"_Sure," Shigeru said, before he typed out commands to open a MIDI file and play it. He handed to Maya a headset for her to hear his music. After a few minutes, Maya smiled._  
"当然可以，" 茂轻轻敲击键盘，打开了一个 MIDI 文件并播放。他把一副耳机递给真弥，让她聆听他的音乐。几分钟后，真弥露出了微笑。

"_This is great! I don't know that you can write something like this," she praised._  
"太棒了！我没想到你能写出这样的作品，" 她称赞道。

"_Thanks," Shigeru nodded._  
"谢谢，" 茂点了点头。

_After a moment, Makoto said, "I wonder how things would look like if we win in the end."  
过了一会儿，真琴说："我在想，如果我们最终赢了，事情会是什么样子。"_

_Shigeru shrugged. "Beats me… I hope nothing goes wrong as we take a bow."  
茂耸了耸肩。"谁知道呢…我只希望我们谢幕时一切顺利。"_

Now the part-time lead guitarist found himself at Asuka's doorstep, and he checked the scrap of paper that told him the right room number: 303. He knocked repeatedly, then the door swung open and he was face to face with Shinji, who was acting as the doorman.  
现在，兼职主音吉他手站在明日香的门口，他核对了那张纸条上的房间号：303。他反复敲门，随后门开了，他面对面见到了充当门房的真嗣。

"It's me, Lieutenant Aoba," Shigeru said. "Good afternoon, anyway."  
"是我，青叶一等陆佐，" 四郎说。"不管怎样，下午好。"

"That's her stuff?" Shinji asked, as both men pushed the trolley into the room.  
"那是她的东西吗？" 真嗣问道，两人一起将推车推进了房间。

Shigeru nodded. "Yeah, right. I emptied her locker. Everything's in that box, and… where's she right now?"  
士郎点了点头。“嗯，没错。我把她的储物柜清空了。所有东西都在那个盒子里，还有……她现在在哪儿？”

"Asuka's having a checkup, and she'll be back in a few minutes."  
“明日香正在做检查，她几分钟后就回来了。”

"I see. I'm sorry to know she'll be out of here."  
“这样啊。得知她要离开这里，我感到很遗憾。”

Shinji looked glum. "Yeah, she needed a clean break."  
真嗣看起来很沮丧。“是啊，她需要彻底断开。”

"Say, tell Miss Langley that I left her box here to you," Shigeru reminded. "I can't linger too long, 'cause I have some work to do back at my station."  
“对了，告诉兰利小姐我把她的盒子留给你了，”茂提醒道，“我不能逗留太久，因为站里还有工作要做。”

Shinji nodded. "Okay, it's all right. Thanks."  
真嗣点点头。“好的，没关系。谢谢。”

"My pleasure," Shigeru said as he left, closing the door.  
“乐意之至，” 斯格鲁说着离开了，关上了门。

---

Now alone with the box, Shinji opened it to begin inspecting the contents. Inside were her two sets of plugsuits, spare interface headsets, toiletries, towels, and her clothes. He took out a red Uniqlo baby-tee, a pair of jeans, a bra and panties, and if needed, a sanitary napkin, and laid them all onto her bed. He also found a pair of Keds sneakers, and placed them on the floor.  
现在独自面对着这个箱子，真嗣打开它开始检查里面的物品。里面有她的两套插入栓服、备用接口头盔、洗漱用品、毛巾和她的衣服。他拿出一件红色的优衣库婴儿 T 恤、一条牛仔裤、一套胸罩和内裤，以及必要时用的卫生巾，把它们都铺在她的床上。他还发现了一双 Keds 运动鞋，并把它们放在地板上。

But he noticed something at the bottom of the box, and he pulled out a small framed picture. Shinji was now looking at a picture of Kaji and Asuka, with the girl piggybacking on him, her laughter frozen by the shot, with blue skies behind their backs.  
但他注意到箱底有样东西，便抽出了一张小相框的照片。真嗣现在看着的是一张卡吉和明日香的照片，女孩骑在他的背上，她的笑声被定格在那一刻，背后是蔚蓝的天空。

He wistfully smiled before he reverently put it back in.  
他带着一丝惆怅微笑，然后恭敬地将它放回原处。

**Author's Notes:** It's been five days since the last chapter, but working on this took a great deal of labor and experimentation, especially when it came to reconciling Asuka and Shinji. I want their conflict to end on a good note, but more importantly, come to terms with themselves.  
作者笔记：距离上次chapter已经过去五天了，但创作这篇作品花费了大量心血和尝试，尤其是在调和明日香和真嗣的关系上。我希望他们的冲突能以一个美好的音符结束，但更重要的是，他们能与自己和解。

For today's chapter, and with a developing habit of putting favorite movie characters in _LW_ (and in-character, of course), I have Colonel Miles Quaritch from _Avatar_ to serve as Keel's henchman and the head of SEELE's "Praetorian Guard".  
今天的chapter，我继续养成将喜爱的电影角色放入 LW（当然，保持角色性格）的习惯，这次我让《阿凡达》中的迈尔斯·夸奇上校担任基尔的副手，以及 SEELE 的“禁卫军”首领。

OBTW, here's a short description on some ACCs in this fic:  
顺便提一下，这里简要描述一下本篇小说中的一些角色：  
_Captain Tsutomo Kanzaki (CV: Jun Fukuyama):_ tall at 5'10", strongly-built. Wears a crew cut. Has gray eyes. He's a ringer for Sung Kang.  
_Doctor Natsumi Odani (CV: Ami Koshimizu):_ stands at 5'4". Her brown-black hair has a short bob cut. Slim. Has dark brown eyes, and sometimes she wears horn-rimmed glasses. Resembles Miki Nakatani (see _Silk_).  
小谷奈津美医生（CV：小清水亚美）：身高 5'4"。她的棕黑色头发剪成齐耳短发。身材苗条。拥有深棕色眼睛，有时会戴一副角质边框眼镜。外貌酷似中谷美纪（参见《丝绸》）。  
_Director Shuya Hamamoto (CV: Norio Wakamoto):_ a little stout, and he's 5'8". Graying, thinning hair. He's like Beat Takeshi in appearance, but sterner and has this constipated look on his face.  
滨本修也导演（CV：若本规夫）：略显发福，身高 5'8"。头发灰白且稀疏。外表类似北野武，但更为严肃，脸上常带着一副便秘般的表情。

If you have any questions or comments, I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading, people.  
如有任何问题或意见，我会尽力回答。感谢阅读，各位。

### Chapter 17 Turning Point  
Chapter 17 转折点

Captain Trudy Chacon, of NERV's 1st Air Wing Service Squadron, was reading a copy of her orders from Director Hamamoto, and approved by Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, as she accompanied her Lockheed-Martin AV-24C Cheyenne II attack VTOL gunship, the huge express elevator delivering both up to the ground, where the crew at the helipad would service the bird, top up the fuel tank, arm it with eight AGM-114M Hellfire anti-tank missiles and a pair of Hydra WAFAR rocket launchers on the wing pylons, and fill up the ammo canister with 20mm rounds for the chain gun, bolted with a sensor/camera suite to a gimbal mounted under the nose, in lieu of the bottom canopy cluster on the pre-Second Impact B model.  
NERV 第一航空翼勤中队的队长 Trudy Chacon 上尉，正阅读着由 Hamamoto 总监签署、Fuyutsuki 副司令批准的命令书，她随同她的洛克希德-马丁 AV-24C 夏延 II 型攻击 VTOL 武装直升机，搭乘巨大的快速电梯升至地面。在停机坪上，地勤人员将为这架直升机进行维护，加满燃油，在机翼挂架上装备八枚 AGM-114M 地狱火反坦克导弹和一对九头蛇 WAFAR 火箭发射器，并为链式机炮的弹药箱装填 20 毫米弹药。此外，机头下方安装了一个带有传感器/摄像头的万向节装置，取代了二次冲击前 B 型机型的底部座舱集群。

Though it looked ungainly at first, this gunship was the toughest of its kind, with twin jet engines, redundant fly-by-light control systems, and even a cargo bay, as the Cheyenne, like the older Russian Mi-24 Hind helicopter, also served as an armed troop transport.  
尽管初看显得笨拙，但这架武装直升机却是同类中最坚固的，配备双喷气发动机、冗余的光纤飞行控制系统，甚至还有一个货舱。正如老式的俄罗斯 Mi-24 雌鹿直升机一样，夏延也兼具武装运输机的功能。

Currently, as the only aircraft type in the NERV inventory intended for combat and transport, the Cheyennes maybe too weak to stop Angels with conventional means, but at least slow down or distract with missiles before the Evas could finally take a crack at them.  
目前，作为 NERV 库存中唯一用于战斗和运输的飞机型号，夏延人可能过于薄弱，无法用常规手段阻止使徒，但至少能在 EVA 最终出击前用导弹减缓或分散其注意力。

Today Trudy, formerly a US Marine gunship pilot coming from San Diego two years ago, will escort a VIP convoy up to Odawara International Airport as air support. She will also be accompanied by her wingman, Major Paul Nguyen, an old veteran of the Second Korean War. Both were competent gunship jocks, confident in taking on anything daring to cross their path.  
今天，特鲁迪——两年前从圣地亚哥来的前美国海军陆战队武装直升机飞行员——将作为空中支援护送一位 VIP 车队前往小田原国际机场。她还将与她的僚机，参加过第二次朝鲜战争的老兵保罗·阮少校一同行动。两人都是技艺高超的武装直升机飞行员，自信能应对任何敢于挡路的挑战。

The elevator ground to a halt, and immediately a service crew with small tractors began hooking them up to the gunships' nose wheels. Trudy folded her orders and put it into the pocket of her flight suit, and turned to Paul.  
电梯停了下来，随即一支服务队伍带着小型牵引车开始连接到武装直升机的鼻轮上。特鲁迪将她的命令折叠好放入飞行服的口袋里，转身面向保罗。

"Things are heating up lately," Trudy said, "and I watched CNN today. International Resistance as usual, giving al-Qaeda some competition. The nutcases just blew up a UN office in Nigeria, ambushed a peacekeeper convoy in Bolivia, and took out a UN representative in Kabul. All in a single day."  
"最近局势越来越紧张了，" 特鲁迪说，"我今天看了 CNN。国际抵抗组织一如既往，给基地组织带来了些竞争。那些疯子刚刚在尼日利亚炸了一个联合国办公室，在玻利维亚伏击了一个维和部队车队，还在喀布尔干掉了一个联合国代表。全都是同一天发生的。"

The International Resistance was the largest anti-UN terrorist group on the planet. Its origins were believed to be in the Northern United States, initially a right-wing Christian fundamentalist terror cell, but after Second Impact their membership grew in numbers, mostly in the US and Europe, after the UN became stronger militarily, fearing the inevitable formation of a "dictatorial world government" and called for "resistance" against all representations of the UN, according to their propaganda materials.  
国际抵抗组织是全球最大的反联合国恐怖组织。据信其起源于美国北部，最初是一个右翼基督教原教旨主义恐怖小组，但在第二次冲击后，随着联合国军事力量的增强，其成员数量在美国和欧洲迅速增长，担心不可避免地形成一个“独裁世界政府”，并根据其宣传材料呼吁“抵抗”所有联合国代表。

"I hope they don't pull off one of their stunts here in Japan," Paul added. "It's very much of a long shot."  
"希望他们不会在日本搞出什么花样，" 保罗补充道，"这可能性非常小。"

"Yeah. I hope those _putos_ don't come here and carry any PADS or RPGs in their gig," she said. PADS meant Portable Air Defense Systems, such as heat-seeking or laser-guided American Stinger and Russian SA-7 Grail missile launchers, useful for ground troops seeking to destroy enemy aircraft and helicopters. RPGs were Rocket-Propelled Grenades, cheap launchers but just as deadly to slow-flying helicopters.  
"是啊，希望那些混蛋别来这里，带着什么 PADS 或者 RPGs，" 她说道。PADS 指的是便携式防空系统，比如热追踪或激光制导的美国毒刺导弹和俄罗斯 SA-7 格莱尔导弹发射器，对地面部队摧毁敌机和直升机非常有用。RPGs 则是火箭推进榴弹，虽然价格低廉，但对低速飞行的直升机同样致命。

"In that case, tell the crew chief to load up some chaff and flares into the dispensers, and make sure the ECM is working," Paul suggested. "It's been very long since the last time we're shot at, just like in the old days."  
"那样的话，告诉机组负责人在投放器里装上一些箔条和曳光弹，并确保电子对抗系统正常工作，" 保罗建议道。"我们已经很久没有被攻击过了，就像以前那样。"

Asuka was relieved that her final physical exam was finished, and right now sitting in Doctor Odani's office she was waiting for her medical records to be processed, her college-educated mind busy recalling lines from many books she read, especially the ones that girls of her age fawned over and buying them like crazy.  
明日香松了口气，她的最终体检终于结束了。此刻，她坐在小谷医生的办公室里，等待着她的医疗记录被处理，她的大学教育背景让她脑海中不断回想起读过的许多书中的句子，尤其是那些同龄女孩们疯狂追捧并争相购买的书籍。

While the doctor wrote some notes on the girl's medical records, Asuka remembered reading a passage from _Twilight_, where Edward Cullen was talking to Bella Swan, giving cryptic hints about the young vampire's true character: _"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?"_  
当医生在女孩的医疗记录上写些笔记时，明日香想起了《暮光之城》中的一段话，爱德华·卡伦对贝拉·斯旺说的话，透露出年轻吸血鬼的真实性格：“如果我不是超级英雄怎么办？如果我是坏人呢？”

She wondered if this case was also applicable to Kaworu Nagisa.  
她不禁思考，这种情况是否也适用于渚薰。

Even though it was a far-fetched theory, it made the girl shiver, especially after he visited Asuka in her dreams. True, his cerise eyes almost hypnotized her; he had an almost musical voice; he was arrestingly beautiful; and above all, he had a gentle elegance and frankness unusual for his age, possessing aristocratic manners Asuka thought to be long archaic for a hundred or so years. Only the lack of a personal background made Kaworu a mystery boy.  
尽管这个理论听起来有些牵强，却让女孩感到一阵寒意，尤其是在他拜访了明日香梦境之后。的确，他那紫红色的眼睛几乎能催眠她；他的声音宛如音乐般悦耳；他的美貌令人难以忽视；而最重要的是，他有着与年龄不相符的温文尔雅和坦率，那种明日香认为早已过时百年的贵族风范。唯有缺乏个人背景这一点，使得渚薰成了一个谜一般的少年。

_Who the heck he is?_ Asuka contemplated. _What he's up to down here? Well, even Shinji and Rei don't quite know, and I've yet to ask Misato._  
他到底是谁？明日香思索着。他在这里究竟有什么目的？就连真嗣和丽也不太清楚，而我还没来得及问美里。

_He doesn't look like a bad guy, but he's too good to be true. Doing seventy-five percent of sync isn't normal. We barely made up to almost fifty-five percent, and that's when nobody's screwing up my test session.  
他看起来不像是个坏人，但好得让人难以置信。同步率达到 75%并不正常。我们最多也只能接近 55%，而且那还是在没人搞砸我的测试环节的情况下。_

_Is Kaworu doing an Edward Cullen on Rei? I'll never know. He doesn't look like he could harm a fly.  
渚薰是不是在对绫波玩爱德华·卡伦那一套？我永远不会知道。他看起来连只苍蝇都伤害不了。_

She remembered Hikari's earlier remark on the phone: _"But she's lucky. He must be a prince."_ Asuka snorted and almost chuckled.  
她记得之前电话里光的话：“但她很幸运。他一定是个王子。”明日香嗤之以鼻，差点笑出声来。

_A prince among us,_ she amusedly thought. _A prince wishing to free the frozen Wondergirl._ She then pictured Kaworu, in a cheesy medieval costume and sword in hand, scaling a jagged mountain, and then crashing into a castle, swashbuckling his way through a mob of green Orkish guards, before climbing up a flight of stairs to the top of the tallest tower, kicking the jail door open to see Rei, chained in iron and waiting to be rescued. He broke free the chains from Rei's wrists and feet, before they came down from the castle, the couple riding into the sunset on a white horse. Cue in the ending theme music and the credits.  
在我们中间的王子，她有趣地想。一个想要解放冰冻的奇迹女孩的王子。她随后想象着渚薰，穿着俗气的中世纪服装，手持长剑，攀登一座参差不齐的山峰，然后冲进一座城堡，挥舞着剑穿过一群绿色的兽人守卫，爬上楼梯到达最高的塔顶，一脚踢开监狱门，看到被铁链束缚、等待救援的绫波。他解开了绫波手腕和脚上的铁链，然后他们从城堡下来，这对情侣骑着白马向夕阳奔去。接着是结尾主题音乐和演职员表。

The redhead was now snickering softly at her own made-up cornball story.  
红发女孩此刻正轻声窃笑，为自己编造的老套故事感到得意。

"What are you laughing about?" Natsumi asked, paused in mid-writing.  
“你在笑什么？”夏美问道，写字的动作停了下来。

Asuka gave a wistful grin. "No, nothing, Doc," she said. "Just a funny thought."  
明日香露出了一个怀念的微笑。“没什么，博士，”她说，“只是想到了一个有趣的念头。”

Satisfied with the reply, Natsumi resumed work as the redhead contemplated of something else to keep her preoccupied.  
对这回答感到满意，夏美继续工作，而红发女孩则在思考还有什么能让她分心的事情。

Asuka was personally struck by Shinji's new behavior, as if he somehow gained a degree of confidence that wasn't present before. He was talking openly, he was rarely nervous, he didn't have that shaking tic on his right hand, and he reasoned like a human being, instead of the frightened, anxious Shinji she was accustomed to (and shouted at) prior to her downfall.  
真嗣的新行为让明日香深感震撼，仿佛他不知怎么地获得了以前未曾展现的自信。他开始坦率地交谈，很少紧张，右手不再颤抖，而且能像正常人一样推理，不再是那个她所熟悉（并曾大声斥责）的、惊慌失措的真嗣，这一切都发生在她失势之前。

Well, Asuka now strongly believed that Kaworu had something to do with Shinji's turn-around, probably gave him better self-motivation and courage that the latter never had in his life. She was beginning to like this new-and-improved Shinji, gradually acting more of a man now than a quivering blob of Jell-O, that even Kaji would've been so damn proud.  
好吧，明日香现在坚信，渚薰一定与真嗣的转变有关，可能给了他前所未有的自我激励和勇气。她开始喜欢这个焕然一新的真嗣，他逐渐表现得更有男子气概，不再是那个颤抖的果冻状物体，就连加持也会为此感到无比骄傲。

But she could feel that his father would still never accept him, even as Shinji was slowly gaining a backbone; all she knew was that the elder Ikari was bent on accomplishing a nebulous objective, and all the Children were fighting Angels at his bidding. She then wondered what was on the mind of Commander Ikari, and exactly what the man's motivation and goal to start from almost nothing to a colossal scientific-military complex dedicated to make battle with mysterious giants?  
但她能感觉到，他的父亲永远不会接受他，即使真嗣正逐渐变得坚强；她所知道的是，碇源堂执意要完成一个模糊的目标，而所有的孩子们都在他的命令下与使徒战斗。她随后想知道碇司令心中所想的是什么，以及他从一无所有到建立一个庞大的科学军事综合体，致力于与神秘巨人作战的动机和目标究竟是什么？

Asuka frowned at one thought about the Commander: because of his obviously cold behavior, was the man a latter-day Doctor Frankenstein?  
想到司令，明日香皱起了眉头：因为他的明显冷漠行为，这个人难道是个现代版的弗兰肯斯坦博士吗？

Unbeknownst to Asuka and thousands of feet below, Commander Gendo Ikari was spending his time meditating and contemplating, sitting on a concrete levee that rimmed the lake of LCL. He was also staring at Lilith's gigantic form, nailed to a steel cross and leaking LCL from the lower part of her body. Despite the horrific appearance, the bloated white creature was generally harmless, although she appeared to be staring from the eye cutouts of her mask. Already ever since Rei pulled out the Lance of Longinus from Lilith's body, the lower half of her body was slowly beginning to acquire legs, still growing from stumps at this moment.  
阿斯克并不知情，而在数千英尺之下，指挥官碇源堂正坐在环绕 LCL 湖的混凝土堤坝上，进行冥想和沉思。他的目光还停留在被钉在钢制十字架上的莉莉丝那巨大的身躯上，她的下半身不断渗出 LCL。尽管这肿胀的白色生物外观恐怖，但基本上是无害的，尽管她似乎正从面具的眼孔中凝视着。自从绫波丽从莉莉丝体内拔出朗基努斯之枪后，她的下半身便开始逐渐长出双腿，此刻仍从残肢中缓慢生长。

The construction workers who built this immense chamber from out of Terminal Dogma's earth never knew of Lilith's existence, let alone they were told it was to be a storage area; back then this chamber was an empty space, and Lilith was located in a different place, being used to create the first of the Evas in secret.  
那些从终端教义之地挖掘并建造这座巨大密室的工人们从未知晓莉莉丝的存在，更不用说被告知这里将作为储藏区；那时，这个密室只是一片空旷之地，而莉莉丝则位于另一个地方，被秘密用于制造第一台 EVA。

Gendo was thinking of the past actions he made, each of them for his own benefit, regardless of who gets hurt. He regretted nothing, save for the loss of his wife, and this traumatic episode occupied his mind since that fateful day.  
碇源堂回想着自己过去的所作所为，每一步都是为了自己的利益，不顾他人是否会受到伤害。除了失去妻子，他没有任何悔意，而这段痛苦的记忆自那决定性的一天起便占据了他的心。

He pulled a cigarette stick from the pack and lit up, before he returned to his meditation.  
他从烟盒里抽出一根香烟点燃，随后继续他的冥想。

All the ingredients he needed were ready to use, but he must wait for the appointed time. The copy of the venerated Secret Dead Sea Scrolls (and Keel Lorenz kept the originals) in his possession were extremely specific: to conquer time, space, matter and life-forces, the practitioner must make the perfect timing. Each incoming Angel since the predicted Second Impact must be killed as sacrifices, and as it was more of a blueprint, every one of those events prophesized by the Scrolls must be accomplished; the practitioner cannot simply leapfrog to the end because that would lead to dire consequences, or so it claimed.  
所有必需的材料都已备齐，只待时机成熟。他手中的那本尊崇的《死海古卷》副本（原件由基尔·洛伦兹保管）极为详尽：要征服时间、空间、物质与生命力，施法者必须把握完美的时机。自预言中的第二次冲击以来，每一降临的使徒都必须被献祭，因为这更像是一份蓝图，古卷所预言的每一个事件都必须实现；施法者不能直接跳至结局，否则将招致严重后果，古卷如此宣称。

Gendo dragged onto his cigarette and his lips jetted out a cloud of smoke. He then thought of Fuyutsuki's earlier warning about the possibility of a broken prophecy. Instead he grunted contemptuously, believing the Scrolls are infallible ancient knowledge and foresight that no other man would dispute or possess.  
源度深深吸了一口烟，吐出一团烟雾。他想起之前冬月关于预言可能破灭的警告，却只是轻蔑地哼了一声，坚信古卷是无可置疑的古老智慧与远见，无人敢质疑或拥有。

After crushing down his cigarette, Gendo then took off one of the gloves that covered Adam, looked at the embryonic creature for a while and then focused his eyes on Lilith. He smiled in pleasure; he knew he would be soon touching Yui's face, provided that Rei was willing to go with him as Lilith's spiritual vessel.  
碾灭香烟后，源堂摘下了覆盖在亚当身上的一只手套，凝视着这个胚胎生物片刻，然后将目光转向了莉莉丝。他满意地笑了；他知道，只要绫波愿意作为莉莉丝的精神容器与他同行，他很快就能触碰到唯的脸庞。

Only Keel Lorenz and SEELE stood in the way, and the damned geriatrics were out to spoil the last lap of his race.  
只有基尔·洛伦兹和 SEELE 挡在前面，那些该死的老家伙们正打算破坏他比赛的最后一圈。

Misato had decided on eating lunch outside the Pyramid (the popular nickname for the NERV HQ building), and so she, Rei and Kaworu went down to the hidden garden, the boy leading the way as they carried their bento boxes. On the lawn near the gazebo, they sat on and open their lunches.  
美里决定在金字塔（NERV 总部大楼的俗称）外吃午餐，于是她和绫波、薰一起下到隐藏的花园，男孩领路，他们各自拿着便当盒。在凉亭附近的草地上，他们坐下并打开了午餐。

As they ate, Misato remarked, "This garden's been here for a good reason ever since this place was developed years ago."  
他们吃饭时，美里评论道：“这个花园自从多年前这个地方开发以来，就一直有它存在的理由。”

"I understand that once in a while anyone can relax here," Kaworu said.  
“我明白偶尔任何人都可以在这里放松，”渚薰说。”

Misato nodded. "That's right," she said before taking in a morsel of rice.  
"美里点头。“没错，”她边说边吃了一口米饭。”

Kaworu turned to Rei, who was quietly eating her vegetarian special. "Have you visited this place?"  
渚薰转向绫波零，她正静静地吃着她的素食特餐。“你来过这里吗？”

"Yes," Rei answered. "I sometimes walk alone."  
“是的，”绫波回答。“我有时会独自散步。”

"I see. Perhaps once in a while you appreciate the beauty of this place. Personally I also like it. Reminds me of a garden—a greenhouse—like this, as I was then growing up. My guardian would take me there and we would talk about anything for hours while he tended the plants."  
“我明白了。或许偶尔你会欣赏这个地方的美景。我个人也很喜欢这里。让我想起了一个花园——一个温室——就像这样，我小时候长大的地方。我的监护人会带我去那里，我们会在他照料植物的时候聊上几个小时。”

"Talking about what?" Misato asked.  
"谈论什么？" 美里问道。

Kaworu smiled. "Mostly about human nature and life," he said. "Sometimes we also discussed philosophy, or his plants."  
渚薰微笑着。"大多关于人性与生活，"他说，"有时我们也讨论哲学，或是他的植物。"

"Is it where you also learned about flowers?" Rei asked.  
"那也是你学习花卉知识的地方吗？" 绫波问。

"Yes. He took great care for much of them, as though they were his children." Kaworu then pointed out the beds of flowers coloring the garden.  
“是的。他对其中许多植物照顾得无微不至，仿佛它们是他的孩子。” 渚薰随后指向花园中色彩斑斓的花床。

"Frankly, Kaworu," Misato said, "Sometimes I wondered about your education. Was your guardian a tutor? He sounds amazing."  
“坦白说，渚薰，” 美里说道，“有时候我真好奇你的教育背景。你的监护人是位家庭教师吗？听起来他很了不起。”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, he was once a professor in Hamburg, and in some ways he was like a father to me. He would spend days teaching me, and I had no trouble understanding many things."  
渚薰点头。“是的，他曾在汉堡担任教授，从某种意义上说，他对我就像父亲一样。他会花上好几天时间教导我，而我理解起来毫无困难。”

"That explains why it's not mentioned in your personal records," she said. "Should've filled out 'self-educated' in the blank."  
"那解释了为什么你的个人档案里没有提及，" 她说。"应该在空白处填上'自学成才'。"

"However, I still have much to learn."  
"然而，我还有很多需要学习的地方。"

"Why?" Misato questioned.  
"为什么？" 美里问道。"

"Because personally there are things in our world that I have yet to experience first-hand."  
"因为就我个人而言，我们世界中有些事物我尚未亲身体验过。"

"And while young and free, seize the opportunity," Misato added.  
"趁着年轻自由，抓住机会，"美里补充道。

Kaworu grinned. "Well, you're right," he agreed.  
渚薰笑了。"嗯，你说得对，"他同意道。

A memory welled up onto Misato's mind. "I remember there's Kaji's watermelon patch," she said. "It's a little further from here. Just found it recently after Shinji told me about it. I've been planning to clear out the weeds and water the patch, but I couldn't find the time."  
一段记忆涌上美里心头。“我记得那里有加持的西瓜地，”她说。“离这儿稍远一点。最近才在真嗣告诉我之后找到的。我一直计划着去清理杂草和浇水，但一直没找到时间。”

"Maybe I'll try tending it instead," Kaworu suggested.  
“或许我可以试试照料它，”渚薰提议道。

"Why not? You have enough free time than the usual."  
“为什么不呢？你比一般人空闲时间多。”

"I see. I think I can do it," Kaworu answered before they all heard Misato's cellphone ringing. She answered the call.  
"我明白了。我想我能做到。" 卡沃鲁回答后，他们都听到了美里手机铃声响起。她接了电话。

"Yes," she replied. "是的，" 她回答道。

"It's Odani here. Miss Langley's ready to go, and I'm done with her records."  
"我是小谷。兰格利小姐准备好了，她的记录我也处理完了。"

"Good. I'll wait there at the main hall and pick her up for final processing. Thanks."  
"好的。我会在主厅等她，然后带她去进行最后的处理。谢谢。"

"You're welcome," Natsumi said, before hanging up.  
"不客气，"夏美说完，挂断了电话。"

After stowing the cellphone back into her pocket, Misato began to pick up the empty bento boxes and put them into a plastic bag. She would dispose the bag into a nearby trash bin. "Looks like we have to go, for you two to say _bon voyage_ to Asuka," she said as they all stood up.  
把手机放回口袋后，美里开始收拾空便当盒，把它们放进塑料袋里。她打算把袋子扔进附近的垃圾桶。“看来我们得走了，让你们俩跟明日香道个别，”她说着，大家都站了起来。

Shinji was waiting for Asuka outside the shower room. On his feet was the trolley with her box of personal effects. As he waited, listening to Coldplay this time on his SDAT player, he thought of the possible would-haves if she were to stay on, especially when this Angel business ends soon.  
真嗣在淋浴间外等着明日香。他脚边放着装有她个人物品的推车。这次他一边等待，一边用 SDAT 播放器听着 Coldplay 的音乐，心中想着如果她能留下来，尤其是当这些使徒事件很快结束时，可能会有哪些不同的结果。

As they were now on equal terms, and Shinji had his self-respect this time, once the war concludes on a peaceful note, he would like to spend more time with Asuka, try to get to know each other. He thought of the past, when they were like the opposite ends of the magnet, repelling each other. Fate must be quite a quirky fellow, as from the day they first met on that aircraft carrier; they were forced to work together despite their differences.  
既然现在他们处于平等地位，而且这次真嗣有了自尊，一旦战争以和平的方式结束，他希望能花更多时间与明日香相处，试着了解彼此。他想起了过去，那时他们就像磁铁的两极，互相排斥。命运真是个古怪的家伙，从他们在那艘航空母舰上第一次见面那天起，尽管有分歧，却不得不被迫一起工作。

Today he now saw Asuka more as a human being, as it was refreshing to hear from her talking normally than before. There was the noticeable absence of her favorite word 'stupid' to describe his vulnerable and hesitant personality, and yet he could still see in her eyes the determination to be a renewed person.  
如今他更多地将明日香视为一个普通人，因为听到她像以前那样正常交谈令人耳目一新。她最喜欢的用来形容他脆弱和犹豫个性的词“笨蛋”明显消失了，但他仍能从她的眼中看到决心，要成为一个焕然一新的人。

The shower room door opened and Asuka came out, dressed up to go. "Who brought the box to you?" she asked.  
淋浴间的门打开，明日香走了出来，已经打扮好准备出门。“谁给你送的箱子？”她问道。

"Lieutenant Aoba, the guy at the command center," Shinji said as he rose from his seat, pulling the earphones off.  
“青叶中尉，指挥中心的那个人，”真嗣说着从座位上站起来，摘下耳机。

Asuka nodded. "Ah, the rocker. I should do some sort of a farewell speech, but it sounds corny."  
明日香点点头。“啊，那个摇滚迷。我应该说点告别的话，但听起来太俗套了。”

Shinji chuckled lightly. "C'mon, let's get going," he cajoled, while pushing the trolley forward.  
真嗣轻声笑了一下。“来吧，我们出发，”他催促着，同时推着购物车向前走。

At the heliport, the two NERV Cheyenne gunships were up and running. Trudy Chacon was on the controls along with her back-seat co-pilot, and a quartet of Section Two agents in black fatigues boarded in from the rear ramp, with one as a sniper and another as a spotter at the open side door, while the remaining two carried submachine guns, sitting on the webbed seats. On her left Paul Nguyen's gunship already began to take off, without agents onboard, so she called up the air traffic controller.  
在直升机停机坪上，两架 NERV 的夏安武装直升机已经启动。特鲁迪·查孔在驾驶舱内，她的副驾驶坐在后座，四名身着黑色作战服的第二部门特工从后部坡道登机，其中一名担任狙击手，另一名在敞开的侧门担任观察员，而剩下的两人则携带冲锋枪，坐在网状座椅上。在她左侧，保罗·阮的直升机已经开始起飞，机上没有特工，于是她联系了空中交通管制员。

"Control, this is Hammer Two, we're ready," she said into the radio.  
“管制，这里是锤子二号，我们准备好了，”她对着无线电说道。

"Roger that, Hammer Two, you're cleared to go," the ATC answered.  
“收到，锤二号，你已获准起飞，”空中交通管制中心回应道。

Trudy began to pull up her left collective stick to increase thrust, while her right hand steadied the cyclic stick for a vertical takeoff. Her Cheyenne screamed skywards, before she slowly pushed forward at 400 feet, swooping over the heliport.  
特鲁迪开始拉动左边的集体杆以增加推力，同时右手稳住周期杆准备垂直起飞。她的夏安直升机尖啸着冲向天空，随后在 400 英尺的高度缓缓前推，掠过停机坪。

Once they were in the air, high above Lake Ashinoko, Trudy said over the cabin intercom, "This is your captain speaking, on behalf of NERV Airlines. Heads up and eyes peeled, you guys. This ain't an exercise today, because any moment it could be the real deal."  
一旦升空，高高飞越芦之湖上空，特鲁迪通过机舱内通话系统说道：“这是你们的机长在讲话，代表 NERV 航空公司。大家注意，眼睛放亮，今天可不是演习，随时可能变成实战。”

"Roger, we copy that," the spotter said.  
“Roger，我们收到，”观察员说道。

Trudy squirmed on her seat, trying to be comfortable. Her eyes were on the armament panel, and she checked if the safeties were off. She then drew her attention to the navigational systems, in full display. Now Trudy put the gunship into a holding racetrack pattern, waiting for the convoy that she and Paul must look after.  
Trudy 在座位上扭动，试图让自己舒服些。她的眼睛盯着武器控制面板，检查保险是否已解除。随后，她将注意力转向全屏显示的导航系统。现在，Trudy 让武装直升机进入了一个等待圈，等待她和 Paul 必须护送的车队。

"Anyone there wishing for some airline peanuts?" she quipped, and the rest of the crew laughed in response.  
“有人想来点航空花生吗？”她打趣道，其他机组人员闻言都笑了起来。

At the Eva holding cages, Asuka gazed at Unit-02 and sighed. The red-orange Eva, sitting in a vast tank of cooling refrigerant, stared down with its four yellow eyes. She seemed to be a bit distraught at Asuka's departure, but her former owner wanted to at least give a final look and contemplate.  
在 Eva 关押笼前，明日香凝视着二号机并叹了口气。那台红橙色的 Eva，坐在一大缸冷却制冷剂中，用它那四只黄色的眼睛俯视着。她似乎对明日香的离去有些心烦意乱，但她的前任驾驶员至少想再看一眼并沉思一番。

"For three years, I studied every inch of her," Asuka said to Shinji, who was standing besides her, leaning on the guard rail. "Read the specifications, memorized the power requirements. Even gone so far as to learn the subsystems so that I could tune it in the field."  
“三年来，我研究了她每一寸地方，”明日香对站在她身边、倚靠在护栏上的真嗣说道，“阅读了规格说明，记住了动力需求。甚至深入学习了子系统，以便能在现场进行调试。”

"I see," Shinji said, nodding.  
“我明白了，”真嗣点头说道。

"There's a terminal in the Entry Plug where I could enter commands to configure the computer, and adjust the way the Eva responds to me. While on tests I would keep on tweaking, and of course there's some programming that I'm not allowed to touch, such as Mode D."  
"在插入栓里有一个终端，我可以输入命令来配置电脑，调整 Eva 对我的反应方式。在测试期间，我会不断调整，当然有些编程是我不能触碰的，比如 D 模式。"

The redhead closed her eyes.  
红发女孩闭上了眼睛。

"It's been a very long way since I met you on the first day," she said. "You were so damned shy back then, a true wuss."  
"自从第一天遇见你以来，已经走了很长的路，"" 她说。""那时你害羞得要命，真是个胆小鬼。"

"And you were like a big shot, too," Shinji added. "Like you're imitating Paris Hilton."  
"你当时也像个大佬一样，" 真嗣补充道。"就像你在模仿帕丽斯·希尔顿。"

"Yeah," Asuka agreed. "All along while we fought the Angel you were wearing my suit, the carrier's captain looked shitfaced, and by the time we came to port, your pals were laughing their asses off." She then chuckled.  
"是啊，" 明日香同意道。"在我们与使徒战斗的整个过程中，你穿着我的制服，航母的舰长看起来一脸懵逼，而当我们到达港口时，你的朋友们笑得前仰后合。" 她接着轻声笑了起来。"

"Sorry me," Shinji said, shaking his head. "At least we won, Kensuke got his wish, and… you know what I mean."  
"抱歉，我，" 真嗣摇了摇头说。"至少我们赢了，剑介实现了他的愿望，而且……你懂我的意思。"

Asuka cocked an eye at him. "What?"  
明日香斜眼瞥了他一眼。“什么？”

Shinji didn't want to tell her that her exposed panties nearly caused Toji's eyes to fall off, and he received a solid stomping from her as payment. "N… Nothing," he said sheepishly. "Except you know what you did to Toji."  
真嗣不想告诉她，她的内裤差点让东治的眼睛掉出来，为此他还被她狠狠踩了一脚作为回报。“没……没什么，”他尴尬地说，“只是你知道你对东治做了什么。”

"That blockhead… Anyway," Asuka said, "As for that Eva of yours, I suppose you have to watch out with whatever she does. She's damned wild." The girl pointed a finger at Unit-01, also soaked in a vat of refrigerant, always with that fearsome look.  
“那个笨蛋……总之，”明日香说，“至于你的那台 Eva，我想你得小心她做的任何事。她真是野得要命。”女孩指着 01 号机，同样浸泡在冷却液中，总是带着那副可怕的表情。

Shinji sighed. "I know, and she probably knows as well," he answered.  
真嗣叹了口气。“我知道，她大概也知道，”他回答道。

There was one thing she must do, and Asuka pulled out her Nokia cellphone to take a picture of the Eva right before her. She aimed the camera and took a snap.  
有一件事她必须做，明日香掏出她的诺基亚手机，对着眼前的 EVA 拍了一张照片。她对准相机，按下了快门。

"That's the last time I'll be seeing you," Asuka said at the silent Eva, smiling sadly as she pocketed the phone. "Goodbye," she added. "Auf Wiedersehen."  
“这是我最后一次见到你了，”明日香对着沉默的 EVA 说道，苦笑着将手机放进口袋。“再见，”她补充道，“永别了。”

---

At the main hall, Shinji and Asuka were waiting, sitting on a bench and her laden trolley besides, when Misato, Kaworu and Rei walked towards them, emerging from the crowd of NERV employees. The redhead stood up from her seat and mumbled, "Misato?"  
在大厅里，真嗣和明日香正坐在长椅上等待，她的行李车就放在旁边。当美里、薰和绫波从 NERV 员工的人群中走出来时，红发少女从座位上站起来，低声说道：“美里？”

"Finally, I'm glad to see you again!" Misato exclaimed before they hugged and laughed.  
“终于，很高兴再次见到你！”美里在拥抱和笑声中喊道。

"Sorry about everything," Asuka apologized. "I'm so sorry!"  
“关于所有的事情，我很抱歉，”明日香道歉道，“我真的很抱歉！”

Misato nodded as they let go. "It's okay, I really understand. I know how much you've gone through. Tell me, how do you two kiss and make up?"  
美里点点头，他们松开了手。“没关系，我真的理解。我知道你经历了多少。告诉我，你们俩是怎么亲吻和好的？”

Shinji and Asuka blinked twice. It was one hell of a bombshell question, as everyone knows that they're called the "married couple".  
真嗣和明日香眨了两次眼。这真是个重磅问题，众所周知，他们被称为“夫妻”。

"Make up? Yes," Asuka answered, blushing furiously. "Kiss? _No,_ absolutely not," she denied. "But the good news is–"  
“和好？是的，”明日香回答，脸红得厉害。“亲吻？不，绝对没有，”她否认道。“但好消息是——”

Asuka and Shinji each took a breath and then said in unison, "_Everything's settled!_"  
明日香和真嗣各自深吸了一口气，然后齐声说道：“一切都解决了！”

Relieved at seeing them together, Kaworu turned to Rei and smiled softly, as if to say silently that all's well ends well. Rei nodded slightly in response.  
看到他们在一起，感到欣慰的薰转向绫波，温柔地微笑着，仿佛在无声地说着一切顺利。绫波微微点头回应。

Misato now put her hands on the waist, looked at Asuka and said, "Okay, we'll have to file your discharge. Have to make it quick before you catch the flight out of here."  
美里现在双手叉腰，看着明日香说：“好了，我们得给你办理出院手续。得赶在你离开这里之前快点办好。”

It took about ten minutes for Asuka to get her papers completed at the Personnel Department, and once they all walked out of the building, standing on the steps she said, "Guess it's going to be bygones to be bygones. Wondergirl…"  
大约花了十分钟，明日香在人事部完成了她的文件手续。当他们一起走出大楼，站在台阶上时，她说：“看来往事就让它随风而逝吧。绫波……”

"Yes?" Rei said. “嗯？”绫波回应道。

"I thank you for everything," Asuka admitted, before hugging Rei for the first time. The First Children blinked, surprised at the gesture. "In the end, you turned out to be a good girl. I appreciate you for trying to open my eyes. I owe you much for saving my life after the Angel attacked me."  
“我感谢你所做的一切，”明日香承认，然后第一次拥抱了绫波。第一适格者眨了眨眼，对这一举动感到惊讶。“最终，你证明了自己是个好女孩。我很感激你试图让我看清事实。在使徒袭击后，你救了我的命，我欠你很多。”

"Thank you, Pilot Soryu." Rei was blushing slightly. "I also accept your apology."  
"谢谢你，碇真嗣。" 绫波零微微脸红。"我也接受你的道歉。"

"Correction, Rei, it's just plain Asuka to you." She then made a wistful smile and let go of Rei.  
"纠正一下，绫波，对你来说我只是普通的明日香。" 她随即露出一丝惆怅的微笑，放开了绫波。"

Rei bowed. "That would be very acceptable," she said.  
绫波鞠了一躬。"那样非常合适，" 她说道。

Asuka focused her attention to Kaworu. "And you, thanks for your advice. I'll remember," she said. "Take care of Unit Two."  
明日香将注意力集中在薰身上。“还有你，谢谢你的建议。我会记住的，”她说。“照顾好二号机。”

"My pleasure," Kaworu said, bowing his head. "I'll do my best."  
“乐意之至，”薰低头说道。“我会尽力的。”

The Audi just arrived in time, parked at the curb, and Agent Kanzaki came out to open the doors for them. He also popped open the trunk to load Asuka's box inside, before they all, save for Rei and Kaworu, entered the sedan.  
奥迪车刚好及时到达，停在路边，神崎警官下车为他们打开车门。他还打开了后备箱，将明日香的箱子装进去，除了绫波和薰之外，其他人都上了轿车。

"Take care of yourself," Kaworu said aloud as he waved his hand.  
“照顾好自己。”渚薰大声说道，挥了挥手。

As the Audi pulled away, Asuka waved her hand at the two Children standing there, before she let the window close. The Audi motored out of the curb and once the car disappeared at a turn, Kaworu looked to Rei and said, "It's time to go. I'll be walking behind you."  
当奥迪车驶离时，明日香向站在那里的两个孩子挥手，然后关上了车窗。奥迪车驶离了路边，在转弯处消失后，渚薰转向绫波零说道：“是时候走了。我会跟在你后面。”

Rei nodded. "Yes, I understand. Be my guest," she said, but smiled softly.  
绫波零点了点头。“好的，我明白了。请随意。”她轻声说道，露出了淡淡的微笑。

While the linear train went up aboveground, Asuka held up what was left of her ID card, now punctured with five big holes and two stamps invalidating the card with the words "Discharged / Medical".  
当线性列车驶向地面时，明日香举起她那张残存的身份证，上面多了五个大洞和两个印有“已退伍/医疗”字样的无效章。

"That's the last of it," she wryly remarked, before pocketing the punched card into her jeans.  
“这是最后一张了，”她苦笑着说，然后将打孔卡片塞进牛仔裤口袋。

"Reminds me of the first time Shinji tried to quit," Misato said. "He ran away, then Section Two caught up with him, got formally kicked out, and it was only when I finally understood the hedgehog's dilemma, I was able to stop Shinji from leaving."  
“让我想起真嗣第一次试图退出的情景，”美里说，“他逃跑了，然后第二课追上了他，正式被踢出，直到我终于理解了刺猬的困境，才得以阻止真嗣离开。”

"What's that?"

"If I can remember correctly, 'the nearer he gets, the deeper he hurts others'. Back then he wasn't able to express himself with words."  
“如果我没记错的话，‘他越靠近，伤人越深’。那时候他还无法用言语表达自己。”

Asuka nodded. "I see," she said before focusing her attention to Shinji. She asked, "Why do you have to stay?"  
明日香点点头。“我明白了，”她说着，将注意力转向真嗣。她问道：“你为什么要留下来？”

Shinji sighed. "I have to," he said. "Nobody else can handle Unit One, I think. Besides, I still want to be useful."  
真嗣叹了口气。“我必须留下，”他说，“我想没有人能操控初号机。而且，我还是想派上用场。”

Asuka grunted. "So much for those crappy compatibility tests," she railed. "Turns out you can impress an Eva, provided you ride long enough until she gets used to you. Like taking care and riding a horse."  
明日香哼了一声。“那些糟糕的兼容性测试真是白费力气，”她抱怨道。“结果证明，只要驾驶得足够久，让她习惯你，你就能打动 Eva。就像照顾和骑马一样。”

The linear train stopped at the ground station, and the Audi rolled out. Kanzaki pulled to the right, drove out of the tunnel to stop at a security checkpoint.  
线性列车在地表站台停下，奥迪车随之驶出。神崎向右一转，驶出隧道，停在了一个安检站前。

"Um… I'd like to ask you something," Shinji said, a bit hesitant.  
“嗯……我想问你点事，”真嗣有些犹豫地说。

Asuka cocked an eye. "Yes?"  
明日香挑了挑眉。"是的？"

Shinji watched Kanzaki show his ID card to the sentry. "What does your stepmother do for a living?"  
真嗣看着神崎向哨兵出示他的身份证。"你的继母是做什么工作的？"

The redhead sighed. "Oh, Marlene's a doctor, basically, sticking with the old man. Tries to be friendly with me, but before she married him, she was already his mistress."  
红发女孩叹了口气。"哦，玛琳基本上是个医生，一直跟着那个老头。她试图对我友好，但在嫁给他之前，她已经是他的情妇了。"

Shinji nodded. "Ah, I see. That explains why you're sometimes upset with them."  
真嗣点点头。“啊，我明白了。难怪你有时会对他们生气。”

Misato opened the window and was talking to the sentry, showing him some papers. They were probably written orders, Shinji guessed from the look of them.  
美里打开窗户，正在和哨兵交谈，向他展示了一些文件。从外观上看，真嗣猜测那大概是书面命令。

"I also have a half-sister," Asuka said. "Melissa's a couple of years older than me, and looks geeky."  
“我还有一个同父异母的姐姐，”明日香说，“梅丽莎比我大几岁，看起来有点书呆子气。”

"Are you still okay with her?"  
"你还能接受她吗？"

Asuka shrugged. "I don't know, but back then I kept my distance from her. Compared to me, she's normal but doesn't want to pick a fight. Almost like Rei, because she's quiet."  
明日香耸了耸肩。“我不知道，但那时候我尽量和她保持距离。比起我，她算正常，但也不想找麻烦。有点像丽，因为她很安静。”

"And what are you going to do if you meet your family again?"  
"如果你再次见到你的家人，你打算怎么办？"

Once the barrier was lifted, Kanzaki thanked the sentry, before he closed the windows and the Audi pulled away. Asuka looked away.  
屏障一解除，神裂火织便向哨兵道谢，随后关上窗户，奥迪车缓缓驶离。绫波零转过头去。

"Guess I'll tell them I want to start a new beginning," she said. "Settle things right and try to get along."  
“我想告诉他们，我想要开始新的生活，”她说，“把事情处理好，试着和睦相处。”

Somewhere in a clearing high on Hakone's wooded foothills, the killer was watching, through his binoculars, the Audi drive past the NERV checkpoint, before it was joined by two Pajeros and a pair of Humvees with swivel-mounted machine guns. Orbiting above the convoy was a pair of gunships, but to combat those gunships, he had his crew arm themselves with portable heat-seeking SA-7 Grail missiles, smuggled from out of Pakistan by way of a drug-running cargo ship. The light vehicles can be easily dealt with using cheap anti-tank RPG launchers and roadside bombs, as with their use in Iraq and Afghanistan, where loose munitions were plentiful.  
在箱根山林木茂密的山麓某处空地上，杀手正透过望远镜观察，奥迪车驶过 NERV 的检查站，随后两辆帕杰罗和一对配备旋转式机枪的悍马车加入车队。车队上空有两架武装直升机盘旋，但为了对付这些直升机，他让手下装备了从巴基斯坦经毒品走私货船偷运来的便携式热寻的 SA-7 格雷尔导弹。轻型车辆可以用廉价的反坦克 RPG 发射器和路边炸弹轻松解决，就像在伊拉克和阿富汗那样，那里散落的弹药十分丰富。

Earlier the killer's crew convened for the last time, in an abandoned warehouse in Odawara. They planned the attack, dividing themselves into separate teams to deal with specific targets in the convoy. As they discussed the plan, the killer was personally amused by the diversity of the fanatics he hired for the job, men with differing nationalities, faiths and ideologies, some bordering on the extreme. They were all competent shots, with previous military or terrorist experience yet disillusioned with their respective governments. Despite a volatile mixture of leftists, rightists, religious fundamentalists, nationalists and anarchists, their common hatred was against the United Nations, including its subsidiary agencies, such as the World Trade Organization and NERV.  
早些时候，杀手的手下们在小田原的一个废弃仓库里最后一次集结。他们策划了这次袭击，分成不同的小组去对付车队中的特定目标。在讨论计划时，杀手对雇佣来的狂热分子们的多样性感到有趣，这些人来自不同的国家、信仰和意识形态，有些甚至接近极端。他们都是经验丰富的射手，有军事或恐怖主义背景，却对各自政府感到失望。尽管左翼、右翼、宗教原教旨主义者、民族主义者和无政府主义者混杂在一起，但他们共同的仇恨指向了联合国及其附属机构，如世界贸易组织和 NERV。

The killer picked up his radio, calling the first team, positioned in the abandoned hot-spa hamlet of Miyogino, east of the convoy's position, to get ready.  
杀手拿起无线电，呼叫位于车队位置东边、废弃的宫城野温泉小镇的第一小队准备行动。

"Alpha, prepare to go. Target Red is on your way on Route 138," he said. "They're two clicks away from your position. Five of them on the ground, and two birds. Two SUVs, two Humvees and one black Audi in the middle. Watch out for the birds."  
“阿尔法，准备出发。目标红正在 138 号公路上向你靠近，”他说道，“他们离你位置还有两公里。地面五人，空中两架。两辆 SUV，两辆悍马，中间是一辆黑色奥迪。注意空中的威胁。”

"Roger that, Alpha's ready," the other man on the frequency confirmed.  
"收到，阿尔法已就绪，"频率上的另一名男子确认道。

"Bravo team, ready," another chimed in.  
"布拉沃小队，准备就绪，"另一人附和道。

"Charlie team, ready," a third spoke up.  
"查理小队，准备就绪，"第三人开口道。

"Lock and load," the killer answered them back. "Leave nobody alive except for the red-haired bitch. She's mine, and I'll finish her myself."  
"上膛准备，" 杀手回答他们。"除了那个红发婊子，一个活口不留。她是我的，我会亲自解决她。"

In the elevator, with Rei keeping herself quiet, Kaworu remembered about the daily walks in the garden with his guardian, Keel Lorenz. He recalled one of their moments between student and teacher, as the old man lectured:  
在电梯里，丽保持沉默，薰想起了与监护人基尔·洛伦兹在花园里的日常散步。他回忆起学生与老师之间的一段时光，那位老人曾这样教导：

"_Son," Keel said. "The time has arrived for you to fulfill your destiny. You have finally come of age."_  
"孩子，" 基尔说。"你实现命运的时刻已经到来。你终于成年了。"

_Kaworu nodded, as he let his gaze wander at the vast number of greenery surrounding them. "Thank you, sir," he answered.  
渚薰点点头，目光在四周繁茂的绿意中游走。“谢谢您，先生。”他回答道。_

_The garden, or rather a huge greenhouse, was lit with sunlight gathered from the solar condenser blocks, as it was located underground. Thanks to a blue-painted vault spanning over the greenhouse, it gave one an impression that he was outside. Insects and small birds abound, with butterflies hovering, all part of a working ecosystem to make this slice of nature believable. Temperature and humidity was controlled by computer, and it was slightly sweltering enough that Keel removed his coat, content to be walking with a shirt and suspenders keeping his pants on.  
这个花园，更确切地说是一个巨大的温室，被太阳能聚光板收集的阳光照亮，因为它位于地下。由于覆盖着蓝色涂层的穹顶横跨整个温室，给人一种身处户外的错觉。昆虫和小鸟四处可见，蝴蝶翩翩起舞，这一切都是为了营造一个可信的自然生态系统。温度和湿度由计算机控制，略显闷热，以至于基尔脱下了外套，满意地穿着衬衫和背带裤行走。_

"_Now listen to me," Keel said. The old man coughed, before he continued. "For years, I sought to find an answer to all of humanity's greatest problems, but in the process I found that humans are susceptible to all evils, no matter the efforts of some who wanted to build a better society, an idealistic utopia, so as to speak. For one, some of them are stubborn, some wanted change and others wanted constancy. The individualism and weaknesses of men hampered the creation of utopias, which by this time are becoming irrelevant, a laughable folly."_  
"现在听我说，"基尔说道。老人咳嗽了一声，继续道，"多年来，我一直在寻找解决人类所有重大问题的答案，但在这一过程中我发现，人类容易受到各种邪恶的影响，无论某些人如何努力想要建立一个更好的社会，一个理想化的乌托邦，可以这么说。首先，他们中有些人固执，有些人渴望变革，而另一些人则希望保持现状。个人的主义和弱点阻碍了乌托邦的建立，如今这些乌托邦正变得无关紧要，成为可笑的愚行。"

"_All idealism is falsehood in the face of necessity," Kaworu said, quoting Nietzsche from one of his books._  
"在必要性面前，一切理想主义都是谎言，"渚薰说道，引用尼采某本书中的话。

"_An appropriate description," Keel approved. "Instead of reconciling themselves over their own mistakes made through millennia, men continue to wage wars, seek profit and power, subjugate his fellow man, satisfy his lust, rape and defile Mother Nature, and the poisons of imperfection continue to corrode humanity. Everything comes and goes, even empires and societies, but I have yet to see something that can outlast all of men's creations."_  
"恰当的描述，"基尔赞同道。"人类没有通过千年的错误达成和解，反而继续发动战争，追求利益和权力，压迫同类，满足欲望，侵犯和玷污大自然，不完美的毒素继续腐蚀着人类。万物皆有兴衰，甚至帝国和社会也不例外，但我尚未见到能超越人类所有创造的事物。"

"_And that's your reason why you want me there," Kaworu said._  
“这就是你想让我在那里的原因。”渚薰说道。

_Keel smiled. "Precisely, young man. Realizing that humanity right now is facing inevitable doom, we sought the first-hand documented wisdom of the ancients, to remake this wretched world as we see it fit. After much study, we have learned how important you are. You have this power, but to utilize it we must learn about its use and potential abuse. I understand that you are teaching yourself how to manipulate your AT Field, is it correct?"  
基尔笑了。“正是如此，年轻人。意识到人类现在正面临不可避免的毁灭，我们寻求古代人的第一手智慧，以我们认为是合适的方式重塑这个堕落的世界。经过深入研究，我们了解到你有多么重要。你拥有这种力量，但要利用它，我们必须了解其使用方法和潜在的滥用。我明白你正在自学如何操纵你的 AT 力场，对吗？”_

"_I'm trying, sir. It takes some concentration to use it, and so far I learned how to create a shield or levitate."_  
“我正在努力，先生。使用它需要一些专注力，到目前为止，我学会了如何创建一个护盾或悬浮。”

"_I know, but use that wisely, son," Keel reminded, upholding a finger in caution. "Don't let anyone discover it once you get there, even if you're capable of shielding the core of your strength. Make one slip, and you will die before you could even reach your destination."_  
"我知道，但要明智使用，孩子，"基尔提醒道，竖起一根手指以示警告。"一旦到达那里，不要让任何人发现它，即使你能保护你力量的核心。只要稍有疏忽，你还没到达目的地就会丧命。"

"_I am aware of its potential for danger, sir."_  
"我明白它的危险性，先生。"

_The old man sighed. "My life is at its nearest end, and so is the world humans exist on. Man has reached a certain point where there will be no more to spare, as he consumes everything in its path and then spits out the refuse, while corrupting himself. But this is the right time to begin anew, where all life must be returned to the first form, to become pure and sacred."  
老人叹了口气。"我的生命已接近尽头，人类所存在的世界也是如此。人类已经达到了一个无法再继续消耗的阶段，他们一路吞噬一切，然后吐出废物，同时也在自我堕落。但现在是重新开始的时候了，所有生命必须回归最初的形式，变得纯净而神圣。"_

_Keel leaned close enough into Kaworu's face, as if he wanted to make a point. "Son, the Scrolls have spoken. The time is ripe. I have prepared you long enough to begin your journey, a journey for our salvation to create a true utopia."  
基尔靠近川澄的脸，仿佛要强调什么。“儿子，卷轴已经预示了。时机已成熟。我已经为你准备足够久，是时候开始你的旅程了，为了我们的救赎，去创造一个真正的乌托邦。”_

The elevator finally halted, and both Children walked out. After they made it through the gate and out into the open, and as he gazed at the clear blue sky, Kaworu said, "I hope they make it there."  
电梯终于停下，两个孩子走了出来。穿过门闸，步入开阔地，当川澄凝视着清澈的蓝天时，他说道，“希望他们能到达那里。”

Tsutomo leisurely tapped on the steering wheel as the car stereo played Angela Aki's music, while Misato's eyes scanned the road ahead of them, their ears kept open for their communications radio. Right in front the first two escort vehicles were just as alert as they were, for it was no time for sightseeing despite the gorgeous scenery they passed by. At the backseat Shinji and Asuka were engaged in small talk about themselves.  
堤摩悠闲地敲打着方向盘，车载音响播放着安吉拉·亚纪的音乐，而美里则专注地扫视前方的道路，耳朵时刻留意着通讯电台。在他们前方，前两辆护卫车同样警觉，尽管沿途风景如画，但此时绝非观光之时。在后座上，真嗣和明日香正闲聊着彼此的事情。

"Things have changed now," Tsutomo said, remarking at the surprisingly empty road. "A few months back this highway was clogged with some tourists, even as we had these Angel attacks. There's no more today, everyone's fleeing for their lives; they're real scared."  
"现在情况不同了，"筒友说，注意到这条曾经繁忙的高速公路如今异常空旷。"几个月前，即使是在使徒袭击期间，这里也挤满了游客。如今却空无一人，大家都在逃命，他们真的吓坏了。"

"That's unfortunately right," Misato agreed. "Except down south, the whole valley's practically deserted."  
"不幸的是，确实如此，"美里同意道。"除了南部地区，整个山谷几乎都空了。"

Tsutomo pursed his lips for a second. "You know what, ma'am, what I am looking forward to?"  
筒友抿了抿嘴唇，片刻后问道："你知道吗，女士，我在期待什么？"

Misato cocked an eye. "What?"  
美里挑了挑眉。“什么？”

Tsutomo grinned. "Tomorrow, I'm taking Doctor Odani out for a date," he admitted. "In downtown Odawara."  
筒本笑了笑。“明天，我要带小谷医生出去约会，”他坦白道。“在小田原市区。”

"Her? She looks hard to get."  
“她？看起来很难追啊。”

Tsutomo shook his head. "You're wrong, ma'am. Been talking to Natsumi sometimes, asking if she's available, and she then said she's trying to find time. But tomorrow's her day-off."  
筒本摇了摇头。“您错了，女士。我有时会和夏美聊聊，问她是否有空，她说她正在找时间。但明天是她休息日。”

Misato chuckled. "Ah, you're so lucky, trying to catch up before you hit the big three-oh," she said, but inside her heart felt a pang, missing her days with Kaji.  
美里轻笑道：“啊，你真幸运，三十岁前还想抓紧时间，”她说，但内心却感到一阵刺痛，怀念起与加持的日子。

"I have to, while I'm young," Tsutomo said, "After this one, if this war ends on a peaceful note, I'm also going back as a country cop. Run a little rural _koban_, go walking on patrols, traffic management, and drag drunks home at night, you know, just like a sheriff."  
“我得趁年轻时做，”筒本说，“这次之后，如果战争以和平告终，我也打算回乡下当个警察。管理一个小小的派出所，巡逻，交通管理，晚上把醉汉拖回家，你知道的，就像个治安官那样。”

Misato cocked an eye. "Where? Here in Hakone?"  
美里挑了挑眉。“哪里？这里在箱根吗？”

Tsutomo nodded, smiling. "Yeah, to be honest I love this place, although I miss the cherry blossoms. Nothing like it in the whole world. I also love simple things… and what about you? Where you'll be when all this shit ends?"  
筒本点头微笑。“是啊，老实说我喜欢这个地方，虽然我怀念樱花。世界上没有比这更美的了。我也喜欢简单的事物……你呢？这一切结束后，你会去哪儿？”

As they were approaching Miyogino, Misato pondered for a second. "Me? Oh, yeah, become a teacher instead. Swords to plowshares... I'd like to rebuild society, and give something back for the future."  
当他们接近宫城野时，美里沉思了一会儿。“我？哦，是的，我想成为一名教师。化剑为犁……我想重建社会，为未来回馈些什么。”

"Not bad, ma'am," Tsutomo remarked. "But as good advice, we have to consider the reality of–"  
"不错，女士，" 筒友评论道，"但作为忠告，我们必须考虑现实的——"

An orange fireball erupted right before their eyes, and the Humvee up in front was suddenly thrown aloft by the shock of the explosion, tumbling sideward, doors ajar and everything in it flung out, before crashing into the façade of an abandoned food stall. The blast's shockwave hit the car, pounding it for a second, rendering the occupants nearly deaf. Instantly the radio waves were alive with shocked admonitions, curses and calls for help.  
一个橙色的火球在他们眼前爆发，前方的悍马车被爆炸的冲击力瞬间抛起，侧翻滚动，车门半开，车内物品四散飞出，最终撞入一个废弃食品摊的立面。爆炸的冲击波击中汽车，猛烈摇晃了一瞬，使车内人员几乎失聪。无线电波立刻充满了惊慌的训诫、咒骂和求救声。

Everyone was taken by surprise.  
所有人都猝不及防。

"WHAT THE FUCK?" Tsutomo yelled, yanking the steering wheel to the right, slaloming in tight turns. "KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!" he screamed into the radio, as he stepped on the gas and went past the fallen Humvee, now exploding into flames and smoke. Misato, Shinji and Asuka were instantly pushed hard to the back of their seats by the quick acceleration.  
"搞什么鬼？" 筒友大吼一声，猛地向右打方向盘，急速蛇行。"继续前进！继续前进！" 他对着无线电尖叫，同时踩下油门，从那辆正在爆炸起火的悍马车旁疾驰而过。美里、真嗣和明日香瞬间被猛烈的后坐力压向座椅后背。

"Dammit, who the hell hit us?" Misato shouted, pulling out her USP automatic pistol.  
"该死，谁他妈攻击我们了？" 美里喊道，拔出她的 USP 自动手枪。

"Dunno!" Tsutomo shot back, shifting gears while clenching his teeth, muttering profanities and imprecations by the dozen.  
"不知道！" 筒友回吼道，换挡时咬紧牙关，嘴里不停地咒骂着。

They made it through, but after the initial attack the convoy was pelted by a hail of gunfire coming from the window of a vacant house. Starry cracks appeared on the Audi's windshield, and he thought he saw from the rear view mirror another Pajero blasted off the road, probably with an RPG. Tsutomo ordered on the radio, "Hammer One! Hammer One! This is Red One, can you hear me, over? We're taking fire! I repeat, we're taking heavy fire! We have hostiles!"  
他们成功穿越了，但初次的袭击过后，车队遭到了来自一栋空房子窗户的密集枪火攻击。奥迪的挡风玻璃上出现了星状裂痕，他从后视镜中似乎看到另一辆帕杰罗被炸离了道路，很可能是被火箭推进榴弹击中的。津友通过无线电命令道：“锤子一号！锤子一号！这里是红色一号，能听到吗，完毕？我们正在遭受攻击！重复，我们正遭受猛烈攻击！有敌对分子！”

---

The two orbiting gunships saw the fireballs, and then the tracers. Trudy Chacon was right; the IR was finally taking names on Japanese soil. Both pilots immediately armed their weapons and countermeasures, and peered into their HUDs for targeting information. The radio was alive with cries for help, and Command back there on the frequency, demanding what was going on.  
两架盘旋的武装直升机看到了火球，随后是曳光弹。特鲁迪·查康说得没错；红外技术终于在日本本土开始发挥作用了。两名飞行员立即武装了武器和对抗措施，并通过他们的抬头显示器寻找目标信息。无线电里充满了求救声，指挥中心在那频率上追问发生了什么。

"Roger, Red One, this is Hammer One, we have a visual on your situation, over." It was Paul Nguyen, who was going in with guns ready.  
“收到，红色一号，这里是锤子一号，我们已看到你们的情况，完毕。”这是保罗·阮，他正准备带着武器进入战斗。

"Hammer One, this is Two, I have visual on an enemy position they just passed by," Trudy chimed in. "Roadside house with red roof. There's a muzzle flash and RPG fire in one of the windows. I'm painting the hostiles."  
"锤一号，这里是二号，我已发现敌方位置，他们刚经过这里，" 特鲁迪报告道。"路边有栋红屋顶的房子。其中一扇窗户有枪口闪光和火箭推进榴弹发射。我正在标记敌军。"

"Confirmed that. Take them out, you're cleared to engage!" Paul answered.  
"确认无误。消灭他们，你们已获准开火！" 保罗回应道。"

"Roger that. Doom on them."  
"收到。让他们尝尝苦头。"

Trudy pulled the trigger on her stick, firing away a laser-guided Hellfire missile, and once more with a volley of Hydras straight at the hostile position. The house, along with two terrorists inside, was instantly demolished in a cloud of splinters, roofing tiles and fire. She completed the destruction by firing a burst of cannon shells at the burning wreck.  
特鲁迪扣动操纵杆上的扳机，发射了一枚激光制导的地狱火导弹，紧接着又是一连串的九头蛇导弹直奔敌方阵地。房屋连同里面的两名恐怖分子瞬间在一片碎木、瓦片和火焰中被夷为平地。她又用一串炮弹轰击燃烧的废墟，完成了这场毁灭。

---

In the Audi, Shinji's heart rate rapidly climbed as he panicked, fear eating him in an instant as the grim reality of being ambushed has taken over everyone in the car. His eyes darted around, desperately trying to look for shelter, unaware that the car itself was completely armored. They could hear the thud of bullets hitting the car's rear.  
在奥迪车内，真嗣的心跳迅速加快，恐慌瞬间吞噬了他，被伏击的严峻现实笼罩了车内的每一个人。他的眼睛四处扫视，拼命寻找掩护，却不知道这辆车本身是完全装甲的。他们能听到子弹击中车尾的沉闷声响。

"Thanks guys, keep up the pressure! I gotta make an alternate detour, over," Tsutomo said to the two gunships via radio, before swerving the car to a hard right, tearing through the center of Gora, the town now deserted completely.  
“谢谢大家，保持压力！我得绕道而行，完毕。”堤文通过无线电对两架武装直升机说道，随后猛打方向盘向右急转，穿过戈拉镇的中心，这个小镇如今已完全荒废。

"W… What's happening?" Shinji demanded, completely shaken, watching Misato trying to get the car's sunroof opened.  
"发…发生什么事了？" 真嗣惊慌失措地问道，看着美里试图打开车子的天窗。

"We're being ambushed!" Asuka added, almost agitated. "We have to get out of here!"  
"我们被伏击了！" 明日香几乎焦急地说道，"我们必须离开这里！"

"I KNOW! Stay put, just stay put, you kids!" Misato roared at the frightened Children. "Now try opening the backseat there! There's supposed to be some guns inside."  
"我知道！待在原地，就待在原地，你们这些孩子！" 美里对着惊恐的孩子们吼道，"现在试着打开后座那里！应该有些枪在里面。"

Asuka and Shinji pulled the backseat off, and they found a pair of Heckler and Koch UMP45 submachine guns with red dot tactical sights. Being the supposed expert, Asuka immediately unsheathed one and handed it over to Misato, along with two spare ammunition clips. Misato slammed a clip and pulled the cocking handle.  
明日香和真嗣将后排座椅掀开，发现了一对带有红色战术瞄准镜的赫克勒-科赫 UMP45 冲锋枪。作为所谓的专家，明日香迅速抽出一把递给美里，并附上两个备用弹匣。美里猛地装上一个弹匣，拉动枪栓。

"Then give me the vest right there!" Misato ordered, pointing at what appeared to be body armor. Shinji furiously tugged at a black ceramic-fiber vest with trauma plates, hefted it to Misato, who began strapping it around her body. The woman then took a deep breath, even as the car was making more than 100 kilometers per hour on these mountain roads, and these aren't just any ordinary mountain roads—this was _Hakone_, a drift racer's holy land. The danger here, however, was present in the form of cliff-side drops up to a hundred meters, with some stretches of road having flimsy side rails and crash barriers.  
“那就把那边的背心给我！”美里命令道，指向看似防弹衣的东西。真嗣急忙拽出一件带有防弹板的黑色陶瓷纤维背心，递给美里，后者开始将其绑在身上。女子深吸一口气，尽管此时车辆在山路上以超过 100 公里的时速疾驰，而这些并非普通的山路——这里是箱根，漂移赛车手的圣地。然而，这里的危险在于悬崖边的落差高达百米，部分路段仅有脆弱的护栏和防撞栏。

"Kanzaki, do you think you could hack those curves ahead of us?" Misato asked, as she picked up a rubber band in a holder on the central console, and used it to tie her hair. She could hear the howling slipstream from the opened sunroof.  
“神崎，你觉得你能搞定前面的那些弯道吗？”美里问道，同时从中央控制台的支架上取下一根橡皮筋，用来束起头发。她能听到从打开的天窗传来的呼啸风声。

"Well, yes… I used to be drifting here back when I was in college," Tsutomo answered rapidly. "Owned a Nissan Silvia, in fact!" he gasped.  
"嗯，是的……我大学时经常在这里漂移，"筒本迅速回答道，"实际上，我那时开的是一辆日产 Silvia！"他喘着气说。

Misato stared at Tsutomo for a split-second. She had a sudden, newfound respect for this man, a gearhead like her, and a true road warrior.  
美里盯着筒本看了一瞬间。她突然对这个男人产生了新的敬意，他像她一样是个汽车爱好者，也是一位真正的公路战士。

"Then make the best of what you know!" she commanded, before sticking her head out of the sunroof.  
"那就充分利用你所知道的！"她命令道，然后探出天窗。

Turning towards the back for a favorable firing position, she could see one of their escort Pajeros swerve and crash into the hillside, its occupants probably riddled by bullets streaming from an oncoming Subaru Impreza sedan, whose ski-masked shooters had their bodies half-exposed and hanging out of the windows, firing away with their guns.  
她转身寻找有利射击位置，看到其中一辆护航的帕杰罗突然转向，撞上山坡，车内人员可能已被迎面而来的斯巴鲁翼豹轿车射出的子弹击中。那辆车的蒙面枪手半身探出窗外，疯狂开火。

"Okay, ma'am, HANG ON TIGHT!" Tsutomo warned aloud, causing Shinji and Asuka to strap on their seatbelts, and keep holding for dear life.  
“好的，女士，抓紧了！”筒本大声警告，让真嗣和明日香系好安全带，紧紧抓住座位。

Even as she heard bullets cracking through the air, Misato steadied herself and the submachine gun on the roof, amidst the side-G forces pulling her left and right, snapped the safety to Burst, sighted the Impreza through the targeting dot and fired.  
尽管子弹呼啸而过，美里稳住自己，将冲锋枪架在车顶，在左右侧向 G 力的拉扯下，她迅速将保险调至连发模式，通过瞄准点锁定翼豹，随即开火。

Unaware of the exploding chaos several kilometers away, Kaworu walked behind Rei as they entered her flat, the door creaking slightly.  
几公里外正爆发着混乱，而对此浑然不觉的渚薰跟在绫波身后走进她的公寓，门轻轻地吱呀一声。

Immediately the squalor inside struck him; it was nothing like what he had previously seen through Rei's mind. Kaworu could smell the mustiness of Rei's home as they went inside, passing through the small kitchenette. He paused, taking note of her stove, the rice cooker and the airpot. The sink was full of empty bento boxes; apparently she neglected to take them out.  
一进门，内部的肮脏立刻让他震惊；这与之前通过绫波的记忆所见截然不同。渚薰随着她进入屋内，穿过狭小的厨房，能闻到她家的霉味。他停下脚步，注意到她的炉子、电饭煲和热水瓶。水槽里堆满了空的便当盒；显然她忘了把它们拿出来。

He recalled what Shinji remembered about asking before making his first time visiting Rei:  
他想起了真嗣记忆中关于第一次拜访绫波前的询问：

_Shinji was feeling doubtful, looking at Rei's ID card in his hands. "It's weird that I know so little about Ayanami, even though she's an Eva pilot just like me," he said.  
真嗣手里拿着绫波的身份证，心中满是疑惑。“虽然我和绫波一样都是 EVA 驾驶员，但我对她几乎一无所知，这真是奇怪。”他说道。_

_Ritsuko shrugged, tabling her Cup Noodles on the coffee table. "She's basically a good girl though. Like your father, she's not good at..." she said, but trailed off.  
律子耸了耸肩，将她的杯面放在咖啡桌上。“她基本上是个好女孩。就像你父亲一样，她不擅长……”她说到一半就停住了。_

"_She's not good at what?" Shinji asked, badgering the lady doctor to finish._  
“她不擅长什么？”真嗣追问，催促着女医生把话说完。

"_Living," Ritsuko concluded._  
"活着，" 律子得出结论。

"Is this how you live?" Kaworu asked, having a bit of a double-take.  
"这就是你的生活方式吗？" 薰有些惊讶地问道。

Rei nodded. "Yes."

The ceiling had a slight case of mildew, with a clothes hanger suspended above the girl's utilitarian hospital bed; while the paneled walls were devoid of any decoration, save for a mirror. The thick curtains kept light away coming from the veranda doors, and in the middle of the room was a stool. To the right was a small refrigerator, with a plastic bag on the side overflowing with wrappers and empty cans of Calorimate, a high-calorie snack bar and drink, and beside that was a box full of bloodied bandages, aged and spangled with cobwebs. On top of the refrigerator were Rei's medications.  
天花板略显霉斑，女孩的实用型医院床上悬挂着衣架；而镶板墙面上除了镜子外别无装饰。厚重的窗帘遮挡了阳台门外的光线，房间中央放着一个凳子。右侧是一个小冰箱，旁边塑料袋里装满了 Calorimate 高热量零食棒和饮料的包装和空罐，旁边是一个装满血迹斑斑、布满蛛网的旧绷带的盒子。冰箱顶上摆放着零的药物。

He took note of the labels on the jars and the pill blister packs (one was labeled "Growth Control Compound 3910", and another with "Enzyme 420B"); they don't seem to look like they came from a drugstore except for the kanji, which told him that Ritsuko Akagi was her personal physician.  
他注意到罐子和药片包装上的标签（一个是“生长控制化合物 3910”，另一个是“酶 420B”）；除了汉字之外，它们看起来并不像是来自药店的商品，这些汉字告诉他，赤木律子是她的私人医生。

The place was wretched enough to make an ordinary girl feel depressed.  
这个地方破旧到足以让一个普通女孩感到沮丧。

"What are those books?" Kaworu queried, pointing at the stack of books on the cabinet, the pages inserted with bookmarks; the spindles never had a title on them.  
“那些是什么书？”渚薰问道，指着柜子上堆放的书，书页中插着书签；书脊上从未标有书名。

"These?" Rei wondered as she walked over and picked up one of the books, opening to a page.  
"这些吗？" 绫波边走边问，拿起其中一本书，翻开一页。

Kaworu nodded. "Well, yes."  
渚薰点头。"嗯，是的。"

"Most of them are about bioengineering, genetics, molecular biology…" Rei explained. "Those subjects that the Commander and Doctor Akagi were interested in. I read them in order to understand what they were discussing and working on."  
"大部分都是关于生物工程、遗传学、分子生物学……" 绫波解释道。"那些司令和赤木博士感兴趣的课题。我读它们是为了理解他们在讨论和研究的内容。"

"That explains," Kaworu dryly remarked, before his attention was drawn to the box of spent bandages. "What about that box there?" he asked.  
"这就解释了，" 渚薰干巴巴地评论道，随后他的注意力被一盒用过的绷带吸引。"那边的盒子呢？" 他问道。

Rei turned her attention to Kaworu. "I was injured many months ago, on the day before Ikari arrived. I was to dispose of the bandages, but instead set them aside as a reminder."  
绫波零转向渚薰。"我几个月前受伤了，就在碇司令到来的前一天。我本该处理掉这些绷带，但反而把它们留作提醒。"

Kaworu murmured almost quietly, but then he saw what looked like an eyeglass case, also on top of the cabinet. "Whose glasses are those?"  
渚薰几乎轻声细语地喃喃自语，但随后他看到了一个看起来像眼镜盒的东西，也在柜子顶上。"那些是谁的眼镜？"

The blue-haired girl picked up the case and opened it, showing the glasses inside, which were shattered. "They once belonged to the Commander," Rei said. "I also kept them after he rescued me… His hands were burned as he tried to open the Entry Plug, which is why he wore gloves from that day."  
蓝发女孩拿起箱子打开，展示里面破碎的眼镜。“它们曾经属于指挥官，”丽说，“他救了我之后，我也保留了它们……他的手因试图打开插入栓而烧伤，从那天起他就一直戴着手套。”

Rei closed the case and placed them back on top of the cabinet. The girl sighed. "I once used to look up at him; I owed him for that act, a gesture of his concern for me."  
丽合上箱子，将其放回柜子顶上。女孩叹了口气。“我曾经仰望他；我欠他那份关心我的举动。”

Kaworu rubbed his chin. "I wondered if you still know more about him, but I think you already said that you have little idea of his true personality."  
薰揉了揉下巴。“我想知道你是否还了解他更多，但我想你已经说过你对他的真实性格知之甚少。”

"That is true," she said, nodding. "He reveals little of himself."  
"确实如此，"她点头说道，"他很少透露自己的内心。"

"Again, it's so strange that you were close to him yet you don't understand what he truly is," Kaworu remarked.  
"再次，你与他如此亲近，却仍不了解他的真实面目，真是奇怪，"渚薰评论道。"

From her position on the sunroof, Misato cheered for a second as she saw one of the terrorists drop his weapon, after she shot him through the windshield, but she needed to take out the driver. She adjusted her aim, beading to the right of the Impreza, and then fired. But the pursuing driver quickly veered left, dodging Misato's bullets, while the Audi was receiving more pockmarks on its rear.  
从天窗的位置，美里看到一名恐怖分子在她透过挡风玻璃击中他后丢下了武器，她欢呼了一声，但她还需要解决司机。她调整了瞄准，对准了翼豹的右侧，然后开火。但追击的司机迅速向左急转，躲过了美里的子弹，而奥迪的后部则留下了更多的弹痕。

_Damn fuck!_ She cursed, but she had to make every bullet count; she guessed she had about forty-five rounds left in both UMP magazines, and then her USP and two spare 12-round clips, but she wasn't sure how big the opposition was; like cockroaches, if there's one of those terrorists, it's possible they were up against more of them.  
该死！她咒骂着，但必须确保每一颗子弹都发挥作用；她估计 UMP 弹匣里大约还剩四十五发子弹，之后就是她的 USP 手枪和两个备用十二发弹匣，但她不确定对方有多少人；就像蟑螂一样，如果有一个恐怖分子，可能他们面对的还有更多。

_How much these thugs were paid to kill Asuka?_ She wondered, the big sister in her heart enraged. _I don't know she's… and possibly Shinji are such big targets!_  
这些暴徒为了杀掉明日香能拿到多少钱？她心中愤怒地想着，作为姐姐的她怒火中烧。我不知道她……可能还有真嗣，竟然成了这么大的目标！

Just as she was about to take aim again, the Impreza was already coming under heavy fire from Paul Nguyen's gunship; bullets from his chain gun were coming after the car, leaving a wake of dirt geysers, and then one round hit the roof and killed an IR gunner inside.  
正当她准备再次瞄准时，翼豹车已经遭到了保罗·阮的武装直升机的猛烈攻击；他的链炮子弹紧追着车辆，留下一串泥土喷泉，随后一发子弹击中了车顶，杀死了里面的红外探测枪手。

From his cockpit, Paul was getting annoyed with the Impreza's tendency to slalom in and out of his aim, and so he switched to his Hellfire missiles and got a lock-on, then fired away, before watching the Impreza a few seconds later disintegrate into almost nothing but flaming steel and smoke.  
从驾驶舱里，保罗对翼豹车在他瞄准范围内左右摇摆的行为感到恼火，于是他切换到地狱火导弹并锁定目标，随即发射，几秒钟后眼看着翼豹车化为一片燃烧的钢铁和浓烟，几乎什么都不剩。

"YEAH! That's how you do it!" Misato yelled, her adrenaline surging and a fist upraised, as she delightedly waved at Paul's Cheyenne screaming past by, but then she was shocked to see a tell-tale smoke trail of a missile from the forest reach out for the gunship, the aircraft popping flares and making a sharp bank to the right.  
“耶！就是这样！”美里喊道，她的肾上腺素飙升，举起拳头，兴奋地向疾驰而过的保罗的夏安直升机挥手，但随即她震惊地看到一条导弹的烟迹从森林中伸出，直奔直升机，飞机随即发射干扰弹并急速右转。

The missile exploded among the smoking flares, but not before a second one was launched from the same location on the ground. This time it hit too near Paul's starboard engine, spraying shrapnel and tearing off the turbine blades and hydraulics, causing the gunship to fall off the sky, forcing him and his co-pilot to eject before the stricken Cheyenne crashed into the mountain, followed by a greasy fireball over the evergreen forest.  
导弹在烟雾弹中爆炸，但就在此时，地面同一位置又发射了第二枚导弹。这一次它击中了保罗右侧引擎太近的地方，碎片四溅，涡轮叶片和液压系统被撕裂，导致直升机坠落，他和副驾驶被迫在受损的夏安直升机撞上山体前弹射逃生，随后一团火球在常绿森林上空爆炸。

Misato was appalled; she was wondering where the second gunship was.  
美里感到震惊；她在想第二架武装直升机在哪里。

---

Two kilometers away, Trudy Chacon saw her wingman come down after the missile hit him. Cursing, she quickly went down close to the deck, almost 200 feet in the air and hugging the terrain, trying to find where the terrorists were firing the missiles. Find them wherever they are, then pay it in spades.  
两公里外，特鲁迪·查孔看到她的僚机在被导弹击中后坠落。她咒骂着，迅速降低高度贴近地面，几乎在 200 英尺的空中紧贴地形飞行，试图找到恐怖分子发射导弹的位置。无论他们在哪里，都要找到他们，然后加倍奉还。

She remembered her uncle, who used to be a Cobra gunship pilot back in the Vietnam War, and regaled her with tales of strafing attacks upon the Vietcong in the Highlands; troops always called them a godsend, the wrath of God with rotor blades. Back then the only problem he encountered were anti-aircraft machine guns, and he would come back to base with some bullet holes on the chopper's fuselage.  
她想起了她的叔叔，他曾是越南战争时期的科布拉武装直升机飞行员，经常向她讲述在高地对越共进行扫射攻击的故事；士兵们总是称他们为天赐之物，带着旋翼的神之怒火。那时他唯一遇到的问题是高射机枪，他回到基地时直升机机身总会有一些弹孔。

But Trudy was up against a very sophisticated enemy, the kind that can hit-and-run with cheap weapons and smarts, then weasel out before the good guys could catch up with them. Terrorists—and guerilla freedom fighters—possessed a unique flexibility, mobility and tenacity no standing army could hope to match.  
但特鲁迪面对的是一个极其狡猾的敌人，他们能用廉价武器和智慧进行打了就跑的战术，然后在好人追上之前溜之大吉。恐怖分子和游击自由战士拥有一种独特的灵活性、机动性和坚韧性，是任何正规军都无法企及的。

Her eyes now scanned the ground, seeking out potential threats but wary of more enemy missiles, and she was trying to find the lone Audi S4 somewhere down there, fighting for survival.  
她的目光现在扫视着地面，寻找潜在的威胁，同时警惕着更多敌方的导弹，她试图在下面找到那辆孤零零的奥迪 S4，它在为生存而战。

---

The dozen IR terrorists, victorious in taking down the Cheyenne with their Grail missiles, quickly boarded two of their pickup trucks, both stolen, then gunned the engines and tore up the tree-lined dirt road leading to the main highway. They have to intercept the fleeing Audi and, if possible, capture their prized target. The killer promised a large bounty if they brought Asuka alive, plus an added bonus if they killed the Evangelion Tactical Operations Manager or any high-ranking NERV officer on sight.  
那十几名 IR 恐怖分子，用他们的圣杯导弹成功击落了夏延山后，迅速登上两辆偷来的皮卡车，然后猛踩油门，沿着通往主干道的林荫土路疾驰而去。他们必须拦截那辆逃逸的奥迪，并尽可能地捕获他们珍贵的目标。杀手承诺，如果他们能活捉明日香，将获得一大笔赏金，如果他们能当场杀死使徒战术行动经理或任何 NERV 高级官员，还将额外获得奖金。

In any case, their first foray in Japan would be a propaganda boost, telling the UN that the International Resistance will strike anywhere it wishes.  
无论如何，他们在日本的首次行动将是一次宣传上的提升，向联合国表明国际抵抗组织可以随心所欲地在任何地方发起攻击。

Shinji was shaking, almost deafened by the roar of gunfire, despite the assurance of the car's safety as Tsutomo tried his best to lose their pursuers. He was regressing into his former behavior of cowardice when Asuka took notice and asked angrily, "Are you afraid?"  
尽管有车辆安全保障的保证，真嗣还是颤抖着，几乎被枪声震聋，筒本竭尽全力试图甩掉追兵。他正退回到以前的懦弱行为中，这时明日香注意到了，生气地问道：“你害怕吗？”

"I don't know!" the young man shot back. "I don't know why we're being shot at! They'll gonna kill us all!"  
“我不知道！”年轻人回敬道，“我不知道为什么会被枪击！他们会把我们都杀了的！”

"But Misato's doing it all for us!" Asuka yelled, completely agitated by the chaos. "I thought you could get a grip, I thought you want to change yourself, but why the fuck are you shaking? Why are you cowering? That's what I HATE about you! YOU WIMP, CAN'T YOU SNAP OUT OF IT?"  
“但美里这么做都是为了我们！”明日香大喊，完全被混乱激怒了。“我以为你能控制住自己，我以为你想改变自己，但你他妈为什么在发抖？为什么在退缩？这就是我讨厌你的地方！你这个懦夫，你就不能振作起来吗？”

Asuka's last sentence was like a bomb going off in Shinji's head, the word "hate" triggering an unexpected reaction in his psyche. Images of things that he feared quickly flashed in his mind, and something cold slithering his insides:  
明日香的最后一句话像炸弹一样在真嗣的脑海中炸开，“讨厌”这个词触发了他心理上的意外反应。他恐惧的画面迅速在脑海中闪现，一股冰冷的感觉在他体内蔓延：

_Father, cold, indifferent and unmoving. Unit-01 pulverizing what was left of Unit-03. The Angel with ribbon-razor arms, hovering over a decapitated Unit-02. The face of Unit-01, with its horrific unmasked visage… A hundred Reis cut into pieces, floating in the tank. Kaji, with his body splayed out, crimson staining the concrete under him. Then Misato slumped on the floor, motionless, a spatter of blood on the wall behind her…  
父亲，冷漠无情，一动不动。初号机粉碎了三号机残骸。带丝带利刃的天使，悬停在无头二号机上方。初号机那张恐怖的未遮面孔……一百个零号被切成碎片，漂浮在罐中。加持，身体四仰八叉，鲜血染红了身下的混凝土。然后美里瘫倒在地，一动不动，身后的墙上溅满了血迹……_

_Finally, a lifeless Asuka, mouth agape and her body soaked in a tub full of red-colored water. Her arm jutted out, a wrist slashed open and dripping blood.  
最终，毫无生气的明日香，嘴巴大张，身体浸泡在一缸红色的水中。她的手臂伸出，手腕被割开，鲜血滴落。_

_No. Not again. 不，不要再这样了。  
I don't want to die.  
我不想死。  
I don't want everyone to die. I don't want to see the people I love die.  
我不想让每个人都死去。我不想看到我所爱的人死去。  
I had enough! 我受够了！  
I have to fight for this love! This friendship! The relations! The things that make me whole!  
我必须为这份爱而战！这份友谊！这些关系！那些让我完整的东西！  
I DON'T WANT TO RUN AWAY!  
我不想逃跑！_

Suddenly Shinji stopped shaking; he bolted upright, and then unfastened his seat belt.  
突然，真嗣停止了颤抖；他猛地坐直，然后解开了安全带。

"What are you doing?" Asuka demanded.  
“你在干什么？”明日香质问道。

Shinji now looked real angry. "I have to do something right!" he answered aloud, pulling the backseat forward and took out the other submachine gun, which in his hands looked large and unwieldy. He also remembered Kensuke's voice, as both boys were huddled around the campfire, his first night after he ran away from Misato:  
真嗣现在看起来真的很生气。“我总得做对一件事吧！”他大声回答，将后座向前拉，取出了另一把冲锋枪，那枪在他手中显得又大又笨重。他还记得健司的声音，那是他逃离美里后的第一个晚上，两个男孩围坐在篝火旁：

"_This, my friend, is a UMP45 submachine gun," Kensuke said, hefting the airsoft replica weapon. "The real thing carries 30 rounds of .45 caliber bullets, a foregrip, and has an accessory rail for scopes, laser pointers or tac lights. Do you want to learn how to use it?" he asked._  
“这个，我的朋友，是一把 UMP45 冲锋枪，”健司说着，举起了那把空气软弹枪的复制品。“真家伙能装 30 发.45 口径子弹，有前握把，还有用于安装瞄准镜、激光指示器或战术灯的附件导轨。你想学怎么用吗？”他问道。

_In the flickering light of the campfire, Kensuke was wearing an olive-drab shirt and a surplus pair of Self-Defense Force camo fatigues. Because they looked ill-fitting and big, he looked more of a child conscript than the soldier he imagined to be.  
在篝火摇曳的光芒中，健司穿着一件橄榄绿的衬衫和一条自卫队迷彩服的旧裤子。因为衣服显得不合身且过大，他看起来更像一个被征召的孩子兵，而不是他想象中的士兵。_

_Shinji looked meek. "Sure… I don't quite understand guns."  
真嗣看起来有些胆怯。“当然……我对枪械不太了解。”_

_Kensuke grinned. "Good, you're lucky to be here so keep your eyes and ears open. Now if you want to use it, first make sure the breech's empty…"  
健介咧嘴一笑。“很好，你能在这里很幸运，所以要保持眼观六路耳听八方。现在如果你想使用它，首先确保枪膛是空的……”_

_Shinji nodded. "Uh, huh," he agreed, listening carefully.  
真嗣点点头。“嗯，嗯，”他同意道，仔细听着。_

"_Then you put the magazine in," Kensuke added, picking up the clip from the ground and inserting it into the magazine hold. "Pull the cocking handle, and switch from Safety to Single-Shot or Burst or Full-Auto. See that?" The military buff pulled back the handle on the side and, showing it to Shinji, thumb the safety to fire._  
"然后你把弹匣装进去，" 真希波补充道，从地上捡起弹夹并插入弹匣槽。"拉动拉机柄，然后将保险从安全模式切换到单发、连发或全自动。看到了吗？" 这位军事爱好者拉动侧面的拉机柄，向真嗣展示，并用拇指将保险拨到射击位置。

"_Ah… I get it."_ "啊… 我明白了。"

"_Now should you run empty, press the magazine release just below, and then slap in a fresh clip, before cocking once more. This is called reloading."_  
"如果子弹打完了，按下这里的弹匣释放钮，然后迅速装入新弹夹，再拉一次拉机柄。这叫做换弹。"

_Kensuke then demonstrated the simple procedure of changing the ammo clip, then pulling the cocking handle. He also showed how to remove the round from the chamber and set the safety back in so that there's no accidental firing.  
随后， Kensuke 演示了更换弹匣的简单步骤，然后拉动枪栓。他还展示了如何从枪膛中取出子弹并重新设置保险，以防意外走火。_

"_And that's how it works?" Shinji asked._  
“这样就完成了吗？” 真嗣问道。

_Kensuke nodded. "Right, it's just simple. I'm hoping that what you learn from me might come in handy someday, especially if you're in a military organization like NERV."  
Kensuke 点头道：“没错，很简单。我希望你从我这里学到的东西将来能派上用场，尤其是在像 NERV 这样的军事组织里。”_

_Shinji merely shrugged. "I'll never know."  
真嗣只是耸了耸肩。“我永远不会知道。”_

Now he realized that the unforeseen _someday_ was _today_, Shinji pulled the handle, a round inserted into the chamber with a hard snap, and thumbed off the safety.  
现在他意识到那个未曾预见的某天就是今天，真嗣拉下枪栓，子弹咔嚓一声上了膛，然后拨开了保险。

Asuka was shocked at his act of defiance. "Are you _mad_ this time?"  
明日香对他的反抗行为感到震惊。“这次你疯了吗？”

But Shinji, after kicking the backseat into its place, stared at Asuka with determined eyes. He took a breath, fighting not to hyperventilate.  
但真嗣在将后排座椅踢回原位后，用坚定的眼神盯着明日香。他深吸一口气，努力不让自己过度换气。

"NO, I WANT TO PROTECT YOU THIS TIME!" he declared, correcting her.  
“不，这次我要保护你！”他大声宣告，纠正了她的话。

Stunned, Asuka was instantly speechless.  
明日香震惊得顿时哑口无言。

Stone-faced, Shinji then turned away, pressing down the power window switch in the armrest, lowering the clear-aluminum-matrix window, and he stuck his body out along with the weapon. The wind was screaming in his ears, he could hear his heartbeat, the adrenaline was rushing, yet the rage was burning as he saw the two pickup trucks came to meet them at a forked junction, guns blazing.  
面无表情的真嗣随后转身，按下扶手中的电动车窗开关，降下那块透明铝矩阵窗，连同武器一起探出身去。风声在他耳边呼啸，他能听到自己的心跳，肾上腺素激增，而怒火却在燃烧，因为他看到两辆皮卡在分岔路口迎面而来，枪火四射。

The young man shook his head, wishing Kensuke was here so that he could thank him for that little piece of military education, so Shinji clenched his jaw, pray that the recoil was no more different from a Pallet Assault Rifle, sighted his target and fired at the nearest pickup.  
年轻人摇了摇头，希望健介在这里，这样他就能感谢他那点军事教育，于是真嗣紧咬牙关，祈祷后坐力不会比帕莱特突击步枪更不同，瞄准了最近的那辆皮卡开火。

_Aim at the target in the center, and then switch!  
瞄准中央的目标，然后切换！_

Not expecting Shinji to come out into the fight, one of the terrorists was instantly shot and flung off the truck bed, screaming as he and his assault rifle hit the pavement. Then a lucky spray from the boy shattered the truck's windshield, two rounds killing the driver and wounding another in the passenger seat. The truck then swerved, and collided with a huge boulder jutting out into the road's shoulder; the remaining terrorists were tossed off the truck bed as it pitched forward in the crash.  
没想到真嗣会加入战斗，一名恐怖分子瞬间被击中并从卡车车厢上甩了出去，尖叫着连同他的突击步枪一起摔在路面上。接着，真嗣幸运地一通扫射打碎了卡车的挡风玻璃，两发子弹击毙了司机并打伤了副驾驶座位上的人。卡车随即失控，撞上了路边一块突起的巨石；剩余的恐怖分子在卡车前倾的撞击中被抛出了车厢。

As she was dealing with the second pickup, Misato was surprised, wondering who took out the first one. She peered down to see Shinji wielding a submachine gun.  
当美里正在处理第二辆皮卡时，她惊讶地想知道是谁干掉了第一辆。她低头一看，发现真嗣正手持冲锋枪。

"For Chrissakes, what the hell you're doing?" she demanded. "Don't you know you could get killed?"  
“看在上帝的份上，你到底在干什么？”她质问道，“你不知道这样会送命吗？”

"I know what I'm doing!" Shinji shot back, taking aim and letting out a burst. "I don't care if anything happens to me or I have to kill a bad guy! I want to help you all! I want us all to make it through this and live! I don't want to be alone!"  
"我知道我在做什么！" 真嗣回敬道，瞄准目标并发射了一连串子弹。"我不在乎自己会遭遇什么，也不在乎是否要干掉坏人！我想帮助你们所有人！我希望我们都能挺过这一关，活下去！我不想孤单一人！"

"WHAT?" Misato yelled while pulling the trigger.  
"什么？" 美里大喊着扣动扳机。

Shinji didn't want to be distracted, concentrating his firepower at the enemy, still shooting in bursts and empty shells flinging away from the ejection port.  
真嗣不想分心，集中火力对付敌人，仍然以连发射击，空弹壳从抛壳口飞溅而出。

"Running away isn't an option! I know now what I'm fighting for!" he raged at the top of his lungs, "I want to live! I want you all to live! I'm taking responsibility today, AND ASUKA IS MY RESPONSIBILITY!"  
"逃跑不是选项！我现在知道我为什么而战了！" 他声嘶力竭地怒吼，"我要活下去！我要你们都活下去！今天我承担起责任，明日香就是我的责任！"

His statement astonished Misato down to the bone. _How the hell Shinji got a new pair of steel balls?_  
他的宣言让美里震惊至极。这小子是怎么突然长出了钢铁般的胆识？

Rei was halfway through preparing their tea, as the kettle began to boil and whistle. She remembered the first time Shinji tutored her on how to do it the correct way, after he saw her spoon too much Earl Grey from the tin.  
丽正在准备他们的茶，水壶开始沸腾并发出哨声。她记得第一次是真嗣教她如何正确泡茶的，那是在他看到她从罐子里舀了太多伯爵茶之后。

As she put the right amount of tea into a glass strainer, she watched Kaworu pick up the empty bento boxes and placed them into a plastic bag.  
她将适量的茶叶放入玻璃滤网中，同时看着渚薰拿起空便当盒，将它们放入塑料袋里。

"I apologize if I neglected about cleaning," she remarked. "I was spending most of my time at the Geofront."  
“如果我忽略了清洁，我为此道歉，”她评论道，“我大部分时间都在地底都市。”

"It's okay," Kaworu said. "I understand that the Commander considers you very important." He tied the open end of the filled plastic bag into a knot and set it down onto the floor.  
“没关系，”渚薰说，“我理解司令官认为你非常重要。”他将装满的塑料袋开口处打了个结，然后放在地板上。

From the cupboard, Rei took out a pair of cheap coffee mugs she purchased with her own money, and then placed them on the counter, before she took the kettle and poured hot water into the strainer. The strainer would soak and let the tea drip and settle in the bottom half.  
从橱柜里，丽拿出了一对她自费购买的廉价咖啡杯，然后将它们放在柜台上，接着拿起水壶，往滤网中倒入热水。滤网会浸泡茶叶，让茶水滴落并沉淀在下半部分。

"I have said earlier that I doubted the Commander," Rei said.  
“我之前说过，我对指挥官持怀疑态度，”丽说道。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I know."  
薰点头。“是的，我知道。”

"Yesterday as we were standing before him, I sense a coldness coming from the Commander."  
“昨天我们站在他面前时，我感觉到指挥官身上散发出的冷意。”

"So do I," Kaworu agreed. "Did you notice why his glasses were colored?"  
“我也是，”渚薰同意道，“你注意到他的眼镜为什么是彩色的吗？”

"Why?"

"Because he's hiding his true feelings, controlling himself throughout the time we faced him. He's wearing a mask, while keeping his distance. Most eyes can't lie."  
“因为他隐藏了自己的真实情感，在我们面对他的时候一直控制着自己。他戴着面具，同时保持着距离。大多数眼神是无法说谎的。”

The First Children picked up the strainer and then poured the tea into both mugs. Rei gave one to Kaworu, and she picked up her mug, before they walked over to her bed and sat down.  
第一使徒拿起滤网，然后将茶倒入两个杯子中。绫波将其中一杯递给渚薰，自己拿起另一杯，随后他们走到她的床边坐下。

Kaworu took a sip of his own, and sighed contentedly. "You learned well, Rei," he remarked after a moment. "Honestly, it's probably the best tea I ever had."  
渚薰啜了一口自己的茶，满足地叹了口气。"你学得很好，绫波，"他片刻后说道，"老实说，这可能是我喝过的最好的茶。"

"Thank you," Rei answered after she drank.  
“谢谢，”绫波喝完后回答道。

"Well… I have something to admit to you," Kaworu said. "I hope you would also understand me, so listen carefully."  
“嗯…我有件事要向你坦白，”渚薰说道，“我希望你也能理解我，所以请仔细听。”

Rei nodded. "I will," she accepted.  
绫波点点头。“我会听的，”她答应道。

Using the stool as a table, Kaworu placed his mug on top of it and took a breath. He managed a swallow of his throat, before he spoke.  
渚薰把凳子当作桌子，将他的杯子放在上面，深吸了一口气。他咽了咽口水，然后开始说话。

"Ever since I locked lips with you when I rescued you, to give you my breath," he said calmly, "I have this strange feeling, this feeling in my heart that I have never experienced in my whole life. I could not describe it at first, but after I looked for its meaning and found it, I realized what this feeling truly was."  
"自从我救你时与你唇齿相依，将我的气息传递给你，" 他平静地说道，"我心中便涌起了一种奇异的感觉，这种感觉是我一生中从未体验过的。起初我无法描述它，但在我寻找其含义并找到答案后，我才明白这种感觉究竟是什么。"

Rei blinked for a moment, but Kaworu was staring at her, a pair of red eyes meeting another. She laid down her mug onto the stool and placed hands on her lap.  
丽眨了眨眼，但渚却凝视着她，一双红眸与另一双对视。她将杯子放在凳子上，双手放在膝上。

"Before that, when I first looked at your picture, I wondered. I saw your unfeeling, something you lost. And when I was face to face with you for the first time, I was concerned about your sorrow, you were then afraid, and your eyes were pleading for help. Eventually, I fell for you."  
"在那之前，当我第一次看到你的照片时，我感到好奇。我看到了你失去的无情。而当我第一次与你面对面时，我为你感到悲伤，你当时害怕，你的眼神在恳求帮助。最终，我为你倾心。"

Kaworu sighed for a moment.  
渚薰叹息了一会儿。

"People always feel pain in their hearts," he said, his heart throbbing, "but they also feel happiness as well. Easy to wound as life is painful… yet could also be healed, too." Kaworu pursed his lips, the first time he felt nervous after being so confident throughout his life.  
"人们的心中总是会感到痛苦，"他说，他的心在跳动，"但他们也会感受到幸福。生命虽易受伤，痛苦难耐……却也能被治愈。"渚薰抿了抿嘴唇，这是他一生中第一次感到紧张，尽管他一直都很自信。

"Rei Ayanami… You are like a flower, a rose, fragile and vulnerable… It's the same with your heart, just as fragile. I want to protect and take care of that rose, and I have a reason why it has to be you."  
"绫波零…你就像一朵花，一朵玫瑰，脆弱而敏感…你的心也是如此脆弱。我想保护并照顾那朵玫瑰，我有理由必须是你。"

"Me?" Rei spoke, a chord struck in her heart. She never heard anything like this from a person, yet she slowly watched Kaworu lean closer, his eyes soft this time.  
"我吗？" 丽开口道，心中仿佛被拨动了一根弦。她从未从任何人那里听到过这样的话，然而她缓缓地看着渚靠近，这次他的眼神温柔。

"You're worthy of love… That's the right word for this feeling," he whispered.  
"你有资格被爱……这个词恰如其分地表达了这种感觉，" 他低声说道。

"W… What is love?" Rei asked, not knowing the word before.  
"爱……什么是爱？" 丽问道，对这个词一无所知。

"Love is one caring for another," Kaworu explained slowly, "communicating with each other, reciprocation between souls… with affection, trust and respect, and opening hearts and minds." He then patted his chest softly where his beating heart was, to make a point.  
“爱是对另一个人的关怀，”渚薰缓缓解释道，“彼此交流，灵魂间的相互回应……带着情感、信任和尊重，敞开心扉。”他轻轻拍了拍胸口，那里是他跳动的心脏，以此强调。

The idea dawning upon her, Rei was open-mouthed. "I comprehend you now," she said softly.  
这个想法在她心中逐渐明朗，绫波零张大了嘴。“我现在明白了，”她轻声说道。

Slowly Kaworu took hold of Rei's hand, and then cradled and caressed it as though the petals of a rose. He took a breath as he felt the emotions coming from her rush into him; he wanted to say the right words, and he knew now what she was feeling at the moment.  
渚薰缓缓握住绫波的手，然后像捧着玫瑰花瓣一样轻轻抚摸。他深吸一口气，感受到她涌入他心中的情感；他想说出恰当的话语，现在他知道她此刻的感受。

The moment was right. Rei kept herself still, waiting for him.  
时机恰到好处。丽保持静止，等待着他。

"Which is why I must say," he said and paused for a second. "I love you."  
“这就是为什么我必须说，”他停顿了一秒，“我爱你。”

And Kaworu slowly began to kiss Rei on the lips.  
于是，渚缓慢地开始亲吻丽的嘴唇。

**Author's Notes:** After some thoughts doing this, I was trying to see how Shinji would react to, say, in a more personal life-or-death/fight-or-flight situation, as I wanted him to answer this question: _"What are you going to do when someone's about to kill you?"_  
作者的话：经过一番思考后，我试图探究在更为私人的生死攸关/战斗或逃跑情境下，真嗣会如何反应。我想要他回答这个问题：“当有人即将杀死你时，你会怎么做？”

Because such unusual behavior could result in a possible OOC, after I studied his personality in detail, I added some reasons and a catalyst for him to make an about-face, to confront a very grave situation, especially when it's his life and others are at stake. Due to his nature, if he's pushed beyond what he could psychologically handle, he would resort to drastic actions that are normally not his thing, such as blind, violent rage (consider the quarreling scene between him and Asuka in EOE).  
因为这种异常行为可能导致角色出戏，我在详细研究了他的性格后，为他添加了一些理由和一个催化剂，使他能够彻底转变，面对极其严峻的局面，尤其是当他的生命和其他人的安危岌岌可危时。由于他的本性，如果他被逼到心理承受的极限之外，他会采取通常不会有的极端行动，比如盲目、暴怒（可以考虑他与明日香在《EOE》中的争吵场景）。

On the other hand, after seventeen chapters Kaworu and Rei now have their chance here. Why so long? Character development is the key, and a character slowly changes his attitude over time, along with relationship development between characters. Again, it takes so much of effort to get into the shoes of the characters and their feelings.  
另一方面，经过十七章的铺垫，渚薰和绫波丽现在终于有机会了。为何如此漫长？角色发展是关键，角色随着时间的推移慢慢改变态度，同时角色之间的关系也在发展。再次强调，要真正融入角色及其情感，需要付出巨大的努力。

Whatever the case, I hope some people would appreciate the alterations occurring in this chapter, as it's not an easy task handling the Children and their personalities.  
无论如何，我希望有人能欣赏这部《一千零一夜》中发生的改变，因为处理这些孩子们及其个性并非易事。

This chapter is dedicated to Alain "Rakna" Gravel and the first generation of Evafic writers. I salute!  
这部《一千零一夜》献给 Alain \"Rakna\" Gravel 以及第一代 Eva 同人文作者。致敬！

### Chapter 18 Kisses & Bullets

For Rei Ayanami, it was a very strange sensation as Kaworu Nagisa kissed her. She was completely disoriented at first, but otherwise she felt free, her heart soaring higher like she never experienced before. It was as if she was seeing the light after being imprisoned in the darkness for a very long time.  
对于绫波零来说，渚薰的吻是一种非常奇异的感觉。起初她完全迷失了方向，但除此之外，她感到自由，心灵飞翔得比以往任何时候都要高。仿佛她在黑暗中被囚禁了很久之后，终于看到了光明。

In the darkness, her early life was uneventful, as a mere test mule for many experiments that most persons would have backed out, but then Shinji came into her life, tried his best to open her heart, to make her a genuine person. Shinji was the first person who was truly concerned with her, someone who possessed that innocence, compassion and vulnerability that she could not find in Commander Ikari.  
在黑暗中，她的早年生活平淡无奇，只是众多实验的试验品，大多数人可能会退缩，但后来真嗣进入了她的生活，尽其所能打开她的心扉，让她成为一个真正的人。真嗣是第一个真正关心她的人，拥有那份她无法在碇司令身上找到的纯真、同情和脆弱。

Just as she was becoming an individual instead of an artificial entity, the Angel cut that experience short before she could blossom, and from there she endured the darkness again as the third and final iteration of her body, doubting her self-worth.  
正当她开始成为一个独立个体而非人造存在时，使徒打断了这段经历，让她在第三次也是最后一次身体迭代中再次忍受黑暗，怀疑自己的价值。

It wasn't until Kaworu Nagisa arrived and he began to reverse her dire situation, little by little. Acts of kindness and affection that she could not derive from the Commander, and he gave open companionship that Shinji once used to supply her before he nearly lost his faith in himself.  
直到渚薰的到来，他开始一点一滴地扭转她的绝境。那些她无法从指挥官那里得到的善意与关爱，以及曾经由真嗣提供的坦诚陪伴，如今他都毫无保留地给予了她。

Kaworu, she realized, was not a mere representative for an unknown agency who sent him here. He was really changing things when hope was at its lowest ebb, when everyone she had bonds with suffered in different ways.  
她意识到，渚薰不仅仅是一个未知机构的代表，他被派遣到这里。在希望最为渺茫、她所牵挂的每个人都以不同方式受苦时，他确实在改变一切。

Now he was kissing her, a confession of his reasons to love her, and she understood what he defined as love; Kaworu manifested it in his actions—he talked to her, he offered his help, he rescued her, and voluntarily cared while recuperating from yesterday's injuries.  
现在他正亲吻着她，这是他爱她的理由的告白，她明白了他所定义的爱；渚薰通过他的行动展现出来——他与她交谈，他提供帮助，他救了她，并在从昨天的伤势中恢复时自愿照顾她。

In response she opened her heart and mind like never before.  
她前所未有地敞开了心扉，任思绪飞扬。

What's more, he was a reconciling and renewing medium as Kaworu went out his way to reestablish bonds between Shinji and Asuka, and make peace between her and the Second Children. Now she finally understood the other two Children's weaknesses, once belligerent and doubting individuals who turned out to have bitter pasts that shaped their divergent personalities.  
更重要的是，他是一个调和与重生的媒介。 Kaworu 不遗余力地重建了真嗣和明日香之间的纽带，并促成了她与第二适格者之间的和解。如今，她终于理解了另外两位适格者的弱点，那些曾经好斗且多疑的人，原来都有着塑造他们迥异性格的辛酸过往。

Kaworu's lips were light, like feathers on a dove's wing brushing against hers, as she felt the tingle in her senses, her heart pounding almost loudly, the passing of time becoming irrelevant. She liked this, it was an amazing, warm sensation, and furthermore, she must thank Kaworu for everything. His selflessness rightly deserved a little more.  
Kaworu 的唇轻柔如鸽翼上的羽毛，轻拂过她的唇瓣，她感受到感官的颤栗，心跳声几乎震耳欲聋，时间的流逝变得无关紧要。她喜欢这种感觉，这是一种奇妙而温暖的体验，而且，她必须感谢 Kaworu 所做的一切。他的无私理应得到更多的回报。

And so she responded by kissing in return, gently leaning onto Kaworu, pressing her lips against his.  
于是她以亲吻回应，轻轻倚向渚薰，将双唇贴在他的唇上。

Kilometers away from Rei and Kaworu, Shinji Ikari was hopping mad, infuriated, and fearless; his soul set on fire and jacked up to 400% as he was shooting away at their pursuers, who were determined to kill without hesitation. The first time he pulled the trigger, he was surprised that the real-deal submachine gun's kick was no different from the assault rifle he used while piloting and fighting.  
在绫波和渚薰数公里之外，碇真嗣怒火中烧，愤慨无比，无所畏惧；他的灵魂被点燃，斗志飙升至 400%，正向那些决心毫不留情置他们于死地的追兵开火。当他第一次扣动扳机时，他惊讶地发现这把真家伙的反冲力与他驾驶和战斗时使用的突击步枪并无二致。

He wasn't alone in the firefight as they flashed past Shin-Miyanoshita on Route 1, heading due east; Misato was blasting away from the sunroof, having understood his true intentions and she let him loose upon the terrorists chasing them; the Section Two agent was driving as if their lives depended on it, drifting through impossibly tight curves that demanded great skill at high speed, with one side of the road sloping all the way up to a mountain peak, the other a steep drop down to the waters of Hayakawa River below. Already the pursuing pickup was having trouble trying to close the gap.  
在沿着 1 号公路向东疾驰，闪过神宫前时，他并非孤身一人与敌人交火；美里从天窗中猛烈射击，已经理解了他的真正意图，任由他向追击的恐怖分子发泄怒火；第二科的特工驾驶着车辆，仿佛生死悬于一线，以高速穿梭于要求极高技巧的急弯中，一侧道路直通山巅，另一侧则是陡峭的悬崖，直落入下方的早川河。追击的皮卡已经开始难以缩小距离。

As they were about to finish off the last four of their enemies in the pickup, Shinji found himself having no ammo, a hollow click coming out.  
当他们即将消灭皮卡中的最后四名敌人时，真嗣发现自己弹药已尽，只听得一声空洞的咔哒声。

"Shit!" he cursed loudly and he pulled himself back into the rear seat. Asuka was still dumbfounded at him, but then sense immediately overtook her as she quickly grabbed a full clip from the backseat and handed it to Shinji, who then tossed out the empty clip, slammed in the fresh one, and cocked the SMG. He took a breath, relaxed that earlier stony expression on his face…  
“该死！”他大声咒骂着，缩回到后座。明日香仍对他目瞪口呆，但随即立刻回过神来，迅速从后座抓起一个满弹匣递给真嗣，后者随即抛出空弹匣，猛地装上新弹匣，并拉动了冲锋枪的枪机。他深吸一口气，放松了之前那张冷峻的脸庞……

And smiled at the girl.  
并对女孩微笑。

"I'm sorry… but thank you, Asuka," he said, amidst the loud cacophony of gunfire, and then poked his body back half-way out of the window.  
“对不起……但谢谢你，明日香，”他在枪林弹雨的喧嚣中说道，然后又将身体探出一半回到窗户外。

Wordlessly wanting to become more useful, Asuka went about pulling out more ammo clips from the rear and placed them on the backseat, before she saw Misato squeeze back in and pulled out a spent clip, then gestured for a new one. Asuka passed the clip without hesitation into Misato's hand and the woman nodded, before reloading and going back into her firing position.  
明日香默默地想要变得更有用，她从后座取出更多弹药夹，放在后座上，这时她看到美里挤回车内，取出一个空弹夹，示意要一个新的。明日香毫不犹豫地将弹夹递给美里，美里点头致谢，随后重新装弹，回到射击位置。

Suddenly an idea came up into Asuka's brain.  
突然，一个念头闪过明日香的大脑。

"What's your name?" Asuka asked aloud at Tsutomo Kanzaki, who was driving, busy weaving through four lanes on the highway.  
“你叫什么名字？”明日香对着正在驾驶、忙于在高速公路上穿梭于四条车道的神崎堤友问道。

"Tsutomo!" he shot back. "Call me Tomo instead!"  
“神崎堤友！”他迅速回应，“叫我 Tomo 就好！”

"Gimme your gun!" "把你的枪给我！"

"What? Are you nuts?"  
"什么？你疯了吗？"

"I don't frigging care!" Asuka shouted. "Borrow it to me, Tomo, and do what I have to do!"  
"我他妈的才不在乎！" 明日香喊道。"借给我，智，我要做我必须做的事！"

With his right hand on the steering wheel for a few seconds, and not losing his eyes on the road, Tsutomo unholstered his Glock 17 and gave it to Asuka. "The ammo's on the center console," he added, pointing out the extra magazines in a holder.  
右手握着方向盘几秒钟，目光始终不离路面，筒本将 Glock 17 从枪套中取出递给明日香。“弹药在中央控制台上，”他补充道，指着支架上的备用弹匣。

"Okay, I know how to use it," Asuka said as she began tying her long hair with a rubber band she found in the console, before opening the window on her side, pulled the Glock's slide, went out and fired.  
“好的，我知道怎么用，”明日香说着，开始用在控制台找到的橡皮筋扎起她的长发，随后打开自己这边的车窗，拉起 Glock 的滑套，探出身去开枪。

Tsutomo went back to concentrate himself on driving for their survival, but then a bizarre thought struck him: they were literally making all other action movies look pathetic in comparison, and it was crazy to see fourteen-year-old kids going out their way to bear arms and shoot for their survival. In Japan, no less! He shook his head and laughed out loud.  
筒本重新集中精神驾驶，为了他们的生存，但随即一个古怪的念头闪过：他们简直让其他所有动作片都相形见绌，而看到十四岁的孩子不惜一切拿起武器为生存而战，还是在日本，这太疯狂了。他摇摇头，放声大笑。

In Ohirodai, a white Mitsubishi Delica van was waiting at an alley adjacent to Route 1, its occupants locked and loaded. They heard the call to go for an intercept, and the driver stepped on the gas and swerved hard right.  
在大廣台，一辆白色的三菱得利卡面包车停在 1 号公路旁的小巷里，车上的人已经全副武装。他们接到拦截指令后，司机一脚油门，猛地向右急转。

He saw the Audi arriving, and signaled his comrades to fire. Three terrorists kicked open the rear door, and blasted away with AK-47 assault rifles and an RPD squad automatic weapon at the oncoming car.  
他看到奥迪车驶来，示意同伴开火。三名恐怖分子踹开后门，用 AK-47 突击步枪和 RPD 班用自动武器向迎面而来的汽车猛烈射击。

---

Just as Misato was about to finish off the pickup, she felt two dull thuds on her back, as if someone was punching her vest. She turned around to see a white van in front of them firing at her with a massed volume of bullets. Misato instinctively ducked back into the Audi and yelled at the two Children: "Get inside! It's too much!"  
正当美里准备解决那辆皮卡时，她感到背部传来两下沉闷的撞击，仿佛有人用拳头击打她的背心。她转身一看，只见一辆白色面包车正对着他们疯狂扫射。美里本能地躲回奥迪车内，对两名少年大喊："快进来！火力太猛了！"

Shinji and Asuka pulled back in obediently, closed the windows and stared at their guardian, breathing profusely. The thuds were becoming heavier, and the clear-aluminum-matrix windows were slowly starred with more bullet cracks, threatening to implode into pieces. Tsutomo was desperately trying to dodge and reduce the damage on the Audi by weaving amidst the danger of the ledge to the far left.  
真嗣和明日香顺从地退回车内，关上窗户，喘着粗气盯着他们的监护人。撞击声越来越重，清晰的铝矩阵车窗上慢慢布满了弹痕，裂纹四起，眼看就要碎裂成片。堤文摩正拼命地在左边的危险边缘穿梭，试图躲避并减少奥迪车的损伤。

The woman fumed. "Those cheeky bastards!"  
女人怒气冲冲。"那些厚颜无耻的家伙！"

"What's next?" Asuka questioned.  
“接下来怎么办？”明日香问道。

Misato grabbed Tsutomo's radio and called for help. "Hammer Two, Hammer Two, this is Red One, do you read me, over?" she demanded. "We're having too many hostiles at once! We're at… Where are we?" she asked Tsutomo, who knew all of Hakone on the back of his hand.  
美里抓起筒本的无线电呼叫救援。“锤二，锤二，这里是红一，收到请回答，完毕？”她急切地问道。“我们同时遭遇太多敌军！我们在……我们在哪儿？”她转向筒本询问，他对箱根的地理了如指掌。

"Ohirodai!" he answered.  
“大平台！”他迅速回答。

"Roger, this is Hammer Two, I got a visual on your position, Red One. Looks like you're in delta sierra," Trudy answered at the other end. "Delta Sierra" meant deep shit in trouble.  
“收到，这里是锤二，我已看到你们的位置，红一。看起来你们在三角洲地区，”特鲁迪在另一端回应。“三角洲地区”意味着陷入了大麻烦。

Trudy Chacon's Cheyenne was screaming down Hayakawa Valley, with guns ready. She already had a lock-on at the enemy Delica, and fired two Hellfire missiles, streaking to meet the hostiles. The first missile hit the front end of the van, the explosion causing it to pitch forward into the air, and another cut the maimed van in half. The Audi went through the rain of junk, and around the wrecked Delica, before gaining speed to widen the gap.  
特鲁迪·查康的夏安直升机在早川谷呼啸而过，武器已准备就绪。她已经锁定了敌方的德利卡，发射了两枚地狱火导弹，直奔敌方而去。第一枚导弹击中了货车的前端，爆炸使其向前飞起，另一枚则将残破的货车一分为二。奥迪车穿过碎片雨，绕过损毁的德利卡，随后加速拉开距离。

She then banked the Cheyenne a bit to the right to take on the pickup, but then made quick maneuvers to confuse the anti-aircraft missiles the terrorists might be carrying. The enemy retaliated by firing a Grail, but Trudy knew better by punching out flares, jinked to the right and ducking low to see the missile stray off-course, enemy guidance missing her by about 15 meters.  
她随后将夏安直升机向右倾斜，准备对付皮卡，但随即迅速机动以迷惑恐怖分子可能携带的防空导弹。敌人回击发射了一枚格雷尔导弹，但特鲁迪明智地释放了干扰弹，向右急转并俯冲，使导弹偏离轨道，敌方的制导系统与她擦肩而过，大约相差 15 米。

Trudy switched to the chain gun, and eyed the pickup in the reticule of her targeting system. She then let loose a three-second burst, chasing the enemy vehicle with 20mm rounds.  
特鲁迪切换到链炮，瞄准系统中的十字线对准了皮卡。她随即释放了三秒钟的连射，用 20 毫米炮弹追逐着敌车。

---

In the Audi, Misato and the Children watched the pickup first lose control, and then its cab was torn apart with bullets from the Cheyenne before it veered to the left, tossing its masked occupants and their cache of weapons and munitions off the pickup bed, smashed through a guard rail and flew off the cliff, heading to certain death into the rapids below.  
在奥迪车内，美里和孩子们目睹了那辆皮卡先是失控，随后被切恩坦克的子弹撕裂了驾驶室，接着向左急转，将戴着面具的乘客和他们的武器弹药从皮卡车厢上甩出，撞破护栏，坠下悬崖，直奔下方湍急河流中的必死之地。

They couldn't see the explosion, but they heard a muffled thud, and then the Cheyenne roared past, making a victorious flyby.  
他们虽然看不到爆炸，但听到了一声沉闷的巨响，随后切恩坦克轰鸣而过，进行了一次胜利的低空飞行。

An eerie silence took over the Audi, all of them quietly taking stock of the situation as they breathed deeply, adrenaline still in their bloodstreams. As she settled down onto the front seat, Misato felt suddenly thirsty, swallowing hard, while Shinji and Asuka looked at each other as they set their weapons down, wondering if they won or lost. The Audi's interior was a total mess, with spent brass cartridges and empty magazines scattered on the carpeting and over the seats. Tsutomo was now slowing down a bit, driving close to normal at 60 kilometers per hour.  
奥迪车内笼罩着一种诡异的寂静，他们静静地评估着局势，深呼吸着，肾上腺素仍在血液中流淌。当美里坐回前排座位时，她突然感到口渴，艰难地咽了咽口水，而真嗣和明日香则相互对视，放下武器，疑惑他们到底是赢了还是输了。奥迪车内部一片狼藉，用过的弹壳和空弹匣散落在地毯和座椅上。堤人现在稍微减速，以每小时 60 公里的正常速度行驶。

"Red One, this is Hammer Two, you're now out of the red," Trudy spoke on the radio. "All hostiles are down, over."  
"红一，这里是锤二，你们已脱离危险区，" 特鲁迪通过无线电说道。"所有敌对目标已清除，完毕。"

With the UMP on her lap, Misato picked up the radio. "I copy that, Hammer Two. Thanks for the assist, that was sierra hotel, over," she answered.  
米萨托将 UMP 放在膝上，拿起无线电。"我收到，锤二。感谢支援，干得漂亮，完毕，" 她回应道。

"Our pleasure, Red One, yours was kick-ass, hostiles swarming over and you beat them off. Gotta go RTB, check on Hammer One and our BDA. _Vaya con Dios._ Roger that and over and out," Trudy said before going off the air.  
"乐意效劳，红一，你们的反击也相当精彩，敌军蜂拥而至却被你们击退。我们得返回基地，检查锤一和我们的战斗损伤评估。愿上帝与你同在。明白并结束通话，" 特鲁迪说完后关闭了无线电。

Misato sighed deeply, finally elated after letting go of the radio.  
美里深深地叹了口气，终于在放下无线电后感到一阵喜悦。

"That's all?" Shinji asked between breaths.  
“就这样？”真嗣喘着气问道。

The older woman turned to the Children and smiled wanly. "It's done," she said. "I didn't expect something unusual coming from both of you, but you two did a job well done, considering that none of you have fired a _real_ gun before."  
年长的女性转向孩子们，苍白地笑了笑。“已经完成了，”她说，“我没想到你们俩会有什么不寻常的表现，但考虑到你们之前都没开过真枪，你们做得很好。”

"Really?" Asuka questioned. "It's just a fluke," she bragged as if she was at the country fair, winning prizes at the shooting gallery.  
“真的吗？”明日香质疑道。“只是侥幸罢了，”她得意洋洋地说，仿佛置身于乡村集市，在射击摊上赢取奖品。

Shinji shook his head in jest; he thought of celebrating for going through the crucible. He also felt he was a _real_ man this time.  
真嗣笑着摇了摇头；他觉得经历了这场磨难值得庆祝。同时，他也觉得自己这次真正像个男人了。

Misato chuckled. "Just like the old days," she said, referring to their synchro training, before turning her attention to Tsutomo. "As soon as you see the nearest gas station," Misato added, "we stop there for a long drink and a piss break, then call up for some backup, explain to the Sub-Commander, plus a quick airlift for Asuka, too, if there's anything wrong with this car. We'll also ask your boss, PR and Legal to clean this up, then we'll book and grill the bastards. If even one of them is alive."  
美里轻声笑道。“就像过去一样，”她指的是他们同步训练的日子，然后转向堤人。“一旦看到最近的加油站，”美里补充道，“我们就停下来喝点水，上个厕所，然后呼叫支援，向副司令解释情况，如果这辆车有什么问题，也顺便安排对明日香的快速空运。我们还会联系你的上司，公关和法律部门来处理这件事，然后我们会逮捕并审问那些混蛋。如果他们中还有一个人活着的话。”

"Okay," Tsutomo agreed, as he picked up the radio. "It's been one helluva day, ma'am."  
“好的，”筒友同意道，一边拿起无线电。“今天真是糟糕透顶，女士。”

"This is going to be one hell of a fucking mess, too, what with some casualties on our side, but personally, this is probably the most action I ever had in my life," Misato remarked, but she grimaced. "And… Oh, shit, will you please hurry up? I think my bladder's about to go off!" she cried.  
“这也会是一团糟，我们这边有些伤亡，但就我个人而言，这可能是我这辈子经历过的最刺激的事了，”美里说道，但她皱了皱眉。“而且……哦，该死，你能快点吗？我觉得我的膀胱快要爆炸了！”她喊道。

Blinking, Shinji and Asuka looked at each other in askance, the redhead began to giggle, and then they laughed loudly at Misato's predicament. Good God, they were also glad to be alive and kicking.  
眨了眨眼，真嗣和明日香面面相觑，红发女孩开始咯咯笑起来，随后他们大声笑出声来，因为美里的窘境。天哪，他们也很庆幸自己还活着，活蹦乱跳。

At the same moment, at NERV's aboveground railroad yard and cargo terminal, a JR freight train from Atsugi arrived with six container vans on flatbed cars, halting to a grind while men in orange coveralls and khaki uniforms scrambled to their positions, their section leaders gesticulating and giving orders through handheld radios to coordinate the transfer.  
与此同时，在 NERV 的地表铁路货场和货运码头，一列从厚木驶来的 JR 货运列车载着六节集装箱货车缓缓停下，身穿橙色工作服和卡其色制服的人员迅速就位，各组组长手持无线电对讲机，挥手示意并下达指令，协调着货物的转运工作。

A forked cargo lifter began to offload the containers from the train and transferred them to waiting trailers, which in turn would be driven to a cargo elevator leading all the way down to the Geofront.  
一台叉式货物升降机开始从列车上卸下集装箱，并将其转移到等候的拖车上，这些拖车随后将被驶向通往地底都市的货运电梯。

The consignment manifesto officially stated that the containers carried heavy construction equipment, dry chemical compounds, sterilization plant fixtures and engine parts, but inside was the weapons, munitions and military gear desperately requested by the Second Section Director, in secret, in order to arm the troops to the teeth.  
货物清单上正式注明这些集装箱装载的是重型建筑设备、干燥化学品、消毒厂设施及发动机零件，但实际上，里面装的是第二分部主任秘密请求的武器、弹药和军事装备，以便让部队武装到牙齿。

Despite some NERV casualties, the two-pronged mission was a success.  
尽管 NERV 有人员伤亡，但这次双管齐下的任务还是成功了。

Kaworu and Rei parted their lips after what seemed to be a blissful eternity. They both blinked their eyes, and stared at each other wordlessly. They also noticed that their cheeks blushed furiously, as their hearts beat as one.  
在仿佛永恒的幸福之后，渚薰和绫波零分开了双唇。两人眨了眨眼，无声地凝视着对方。他们也注意到自己的脸颊因心跳同步而变得通红。

"S… Sorry," Kaworu said, first to break the silence.  
“对…对不起，”渚薰率先打破了沉默。

"It is all right," Rei answered. "I understand your feelings about me."  
"没事的," 丽回答道。"我理解你对我的感情。"

"Yes," he whispered. "Thank you for giving me a chance to share them."  
"是的," 他低声说道。"谢谢你给我机会分享它们。"

There was a pause between the two Children, taking stock of the aftermath of their first kiss, but Kaworu felt he needed to do something.  
两个孩子之间出现了一阵沉默，他们在回味第一次亲吻后的余韵，但渚薰觉得他需要做些什么。

"Can I open the windows?" Kaworu asked.  
"我可以打开窗户吗？" 渚薰问道。

Rei nodded. "Yes, you may."  
绫波点点头。"可以，你开吧。"

"Now, wait here," he said, smiling.  
"现在，在这里等一下，" 他说着，微笑着。

Kaworu stood up and looked around, and then because the near-darkness and the mustiness of the room seemed oppressive, he walked up to the veranda window and parted the curtains. He was greeted by what was left of Tokyo-3, a crater lake instead of a city skyline with a backdrop of Hakone's mountains. He then opened the sliding doors and let the breeze come in.  
渚薰站起身来环顾四周，随后因为房间里的昏暗和霉味让他感到压抑，便走向阳台窗户，拉开窗帘。映入眼帘的是东京-3 的残骸，一个陨石坑湖取代了城市的天际线，背后是箱根的山脉。他随即打开滑动门，让微风徐徐吹入。

"Much better," he remarked before turning back to Rei, whose blue hair was being tousled by the wind. Kaworu sat down on the bed and said, "I had to kiss you because… it's the only way I could express this love."  
“好多了，”他转头对绫波说，她的蓝发被风吹得凌乱。渚薰坐在床上，说道：“我必须吻你，因为……这是唯一能表达这份爱的方式。”

"I feel… free," Rei said. "It was as if I saw the light."  
“我感觉……自由了，”绫波说，“仿佛看到了光明。”

"Why?"

"I… The Commander may want me close, but I do not know him well. He may care, but there is in him that keeps him from doing things that you can do. He may talk, but he could be choosing his words. I may have this bond with him, yet he seems to be distant, like he is thinking of something else."  
"我…指挥官可能希望我靠近他，但我并不了解他。他或许关心，但他内心有某种东西阻止他做你能做的事情。他可能会说话，但他可能在斟酌言辞。我可能与他有这种联系，但他似乎很疏远，好像在想着别的事情。"

Rei looked at him. "It seems that we have our own secrets. We are mysteries to many people who do not know us well, except for what we appear to them on the outside."  
丽看着他。"看来我们都有自己的秘密。对于那些不太了解我们的人，我们只是他们眼中外表的谜团。"

"That's right, I'm afraid," Kaworu agreed.  
"没错，恐怕是这样，"渚同意道。"

"Therefore I want you to answer some questions that left me doubting about you since you came here," Rei said.  
"因此，我希望你能回答一些自你来到这里后让我对你产生怀疑的问题，" 丽说道。

Kaworu frowned. "What is it, then?"  
渚薰皱了皱眉。"那么，是什么呢？"

"Who you are, what are you doing here, and the purpose of your presence," Rei stated. "But first, I must lead you down to show you my secret."  
"你是谁，你在这里做什么，以及你存在的目的，" 丽陈述道。"但首先，我必须带你下去，向你展示我的秘密。"

---

They stopped at an Eneos service station at the Yamazaki Interchange, close to Odawara City, where Misato quickly rushed to the toilet and peed, with Tsutomo making calls to NERV HQ, while the two Children went into the convenience store and bought themselves big bottles of cold beverage and water. The cashier was astonished at their haggard, sweaty appearance as she processed their purchases.  
他们在山崎交汇处的一家 Eneos 服务站停下，靠近小田原市，Misato 迅速冲向厕所小便，而 Tsutomo 则忙着给 NERV 总部打电话，两位孩子则走进便利店，为自己买了几大瓶冷饮和水。收银员看到他们憔悴、满身是汗的样子，处理他们的购买时显得十分惊讶。

As soon as Misato was finished, they all sat on the curb together with bottles in hand and drank deeply. While they waited, letting the adrenaline subside, Tsutomo was the first to ask.  
Misato 一完事，他们就一起坐在路边，手里拿着瓶子，大口喝着。在等待的过程中，随着肾上腺素的消退，Tsutomo 首先开口问道。

"I expected this to be a light piece of work," he said, "but, damn, why would someone attack us with that much firepower, considering that we're basically ferrying you to the airport?"  
“我本以为这只是件轻松的差事，”他说，“但是，该死，考虑到我们基本上只是送你们去机场，为什么会有人用这么多火力来攻击我们？”

Obviously the question was aimed at Asuka, who knotted her forehead after she was done checking her backpack. "Who, me?"  
"显然这个问题是针对明日香的，她在检查完背包后皱起了眉头。“谁，我吗？””

"It could be someone who has a grudge against us," Misato said. "Things aren't doing well with the UN lately, with some terrorists attacking them."  
"“可能是对我们怀恨在心的人，”美里说。“最近联合国不太平，有些恐怖分子在袭击他们。””

"I don't have enemies that _mad_, really," Asuka said. "Not the seriously insane like those jerks."  
"“我真的没有那么疯狂的敌人，”明日香说。“不像那些疯子那样。””

Tsutomo took a deep breath. "All right, I think all of you have the right to know, so before I say this, don't get mad at me," he said.  
筒友深吸了一口气。“好吧，我认为你们都有权知道，所以在我说之前，请不要生我的气，”他说。

"Now, precisely what the heck is going on?" Shinji asked, frowning.  
“现在，到底发生了什么事？”真嗣皱着眉头问道。

"Well," he said, sighing, "the purpose of ferrying you to the airport was a _diversion_."  
“嗯，”他叹了口气说，“送你们去机场其实是个幌子。”

"WHAT?" Shinji and Asuka screeched in unison.  
"什么？" 真嗣和明日香齐声尖叫道。

Tsutomo explained about the new weapons shipment that was badly needed, and the need to root out any possible NERV enemies in the Hakone area, especially infiltrators, terrorists and sleeper agents. He also answered any hard questions.  
堤人母解释了急需的新武器补给，以及清除箱根地区任何可能的 NERV 敌人的必要性，特别是渗透者、恐怖分子和潜伏特工。他还回答了所有棘手的问题。

"I'm so sorry that I put you guys in harm's way," Tsutomo said. "It's too important."  
"我很抱歉让你们陷入危险之中，" 堤人母说，"这太重要了。"

Asuka was visibly annoyed. "Damn! You should've told us in the first place!" she railed. "It would've been easier using one of those gunships than having us almost close to being killed!"  
明日香明显恼怒了。“该死！你一开始就该告诉我们！”她责备道。“用那些武装直升机本可以更轻松，而不是让我们差点丧命！”

"I should have, but I was following my boss' plans." The agent shook his head. "The last thing he wanted was to have a screwed-up record upon retirement, and already he's under pressure after too many problems."  
“我本该如此，但我得遵循上司的计划。”特工摇了摇头。“他最不希望的就是退休时留下一团糟的记录，而且他已经因为太多问题而备受压力了。”

"From who?" Shinji asked.  
“来自谁？”真嗣问道。

"Your dad," Tsutomo answered. "The Man with the Plan."  
"你爸，" 筒本回答道。"那位有计划的男人。"

Shinji shook his head. "Looks like I'm not the only one," he said.  
真嗣摇了摇头。"看来我不是唯一一个，" 他说。

"Yeah," Tsutomo agreed. "I know your plight. It's an open secret in the neighborhood; everyone knows that you couldn't get along with him, that he gives you the cold shoulder."  
"是啊，" 筒本同意道。"我懂你的苦衷。这在邻里间是个公开的秘密；大家都知道你和他处不来，他对你冷眼相待。"

"Now why would someone try to kill me?" Asuka asked, looking worried.  
"为什么有人会想杀我呢？" 明日香问道，面露忧色。

"I have no idea what those bastards were up to," Misato admitted. "Not until we get to the bottom of this..."  
"我不知道那些混蛋在搞什么鬼，" 美里承认道。"直到我们查清楚这一切..."

Then they saw several NERV vehicles quickly converge on the station's parking lot, emergency strobes flashing while a Cheyenne landed at a nearby vacant lot, dust flying as its turbines wound down. From the aircraft, a distraught Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki and Lieutenant Makoto Hyuga alighted from the rear ramp and walked towards them.  
随后，他们看到几辆 NERV 的车辆迅速聚集在车站的停车场，紧急闪光灯闪烁着，一架夏安直升机降落在附近的一块空地上，涡轮减速时尘土飞扬。从飞机上，忧心忡忡的副司令官冬月和少尉日向诚从后舱门下来，走向他们。

"What happened, Major?" Fuyutsuki asked, while several Section Two men came out of their SUVs and went about checking the beat-up Audi S4, nearly covered in bullet dents, and already two of the tires were flat.  
“发生了什么，少校？”冬月问道，与此同时，几名第二分部的成员从他们的 SUV 中走出，开始检查那辆几乎被子弹打得千疮百孔的奥迪 S4，两个轮胎已经瘪了。

"It's a long story, sir," Misato said, before taking a deep breath and began reciting her report on the spot as Makoto jotted down notes on his iPad. Tsutomo walked around the Audi, his black coat draped on his shoulder and tie loosened, inspecting the battle damage while talking to his fellow agents. They were in awe of him as they listened to his narrative.  
“说来话长，长官，”美里答道，随即深吸一口气，当场开始复述她的报告，而真希则在他的 iPad 上做着笔记。筒本绕着奥迪走了一圈，黑色大衣披在肩上，领带松开，一边检查战斗痕迹一边与同事交谈。他们听着他的叙述，对他充满了敬畏。

While they were busy, Asuka and Shinji were themselves alone at the curb.  
在他们忙碌的同时，明日香和真嗣独自站在路边。

"I'm still bothered," Shinji said.  
"我还是感到困扰，" 真嗣说。

"About what?" Asuka questioned.  
"关于什么？" 明日香问道。

The young man sighed. "I… I don't know, but I just killed people today," he admitted.  
年轻人叹了口气。"我……我不知道，但我今天确实杀了人，" 他承认道。

"Why do you have to feel guilty when they're really going after our necks?"  
"为什么他们真的要追杀我们，你却感到内疚？"

"I always thought it to be wrong. Kill Angels, yes, but… people, no."  
"我一直认为这是错误的。杀天使可以，但……杀人，不行。"

Asuka glared at him. "They're _bad guys_, you know! Terrorists!" she scolded. "True, it's not easy when you're forced to kill for the first time. We had no other choice, we had to fight."  
明日香瞪着他。“他们是坏人，你知道的！恐怖分子！”她责备道。“确实，第一次被迫杀人不容易。我们别无选择，必须战斗。”

Shinji said nothing. 真嗣一言不发。

"Listen to me," Asuka said. "We're in very strange times, and these times aren't very good for us. Not everyone likes us, apparently someone hates me, and that's going too far. What are you going to do if some punk breaks into your house, and is armed? Are you going to surrender, or are you going to put up a fight?"  
"听我说，"明日香说道。"我们正处在非常奇怪的时期，这些时期对我们并不友好。显然，不是每个人都喜欢我们，有人似乎恨我，这太过分了。如果有个混混闯进你家，还带着武器，你是打算投降，还是奋起反抗？"

"I don't know," Shinji groaned.  
"我不知道，"真嗣呻吟道。

"Now what if that punk decides to kill you because you're a potential witness? What are you going to do?"  
"如果那个混蛋决定杀你灭口，因为你可能是个目击者，你打算怎么办？"

The young man closed his eyes hard, trying to think about the consequences.  
年轻人紧紧闭上眼睛，试图思考后果。

"I… I think I should be glad instead for shooting back," Shinji said. "You're right. I have to fight than die."  
"我……我想我应该庆幸自己还击了，" 真嗣说。"你说得对。我必须战斗，而不是等死。"

Asuka nodded. "Oh, see what I mean. You told me you wanted to do the right thing, and you did, and then you say that you're so bothered about shooting up terrorists. C'mon, Shinji, that's how war feels like because the first time you kill on the battlefield as a recruit you have second thoughts on the first night, and then the next time it becomes part of your duty; you can't object, it's your duty as a soldier to kill if necessary."  
明日香点点头。“哦，明白我的意思了吧。你告诉我你想做正确的事，你也确实做了，然后你又说你对射杀恐怖分子感到困扰。拜托，真嗣，这就是战争的感觉，因为作为新兵第一次在战场上杀人时，你会在第一个晚上犹豫不决，然后下一次这就成了你的职责；你不能反对，作为士兵，必要时杀人就是你的职责。”

"Ah… That made sense," Shinji said, before groaning. "I think I'll have to live with this from now on."  
“啊…这说得通，”真嗣说道，随后呻吟了一声。“我想从今往后我得习惯这个。”

"That's right. Same with me," Asuka agreed, shrugging her shoulders.  
“没错。我也一样，”明日香同意道，耸了耸肩。

Both Children watched the crowd for a while, trying to take stock of their predicament, drinking Pocari Sweat until something came up upon Asuka's mind.  
两个孩子观察了一会儿人群，试图评估自己的困境，喝着宝矿力水特，直到明日香脑海中浮现出某个念头。

"Damn," she muttered. "How disgusting."  
“该死，”她低声咒骂，“真恶心。”

"What?" Shinji asked, putting his bottle down.  
“什么？”真嗣问道，放下手中的瓶子。

"We came up against a bunch of amateurs, that's what!" she exclaimed, before laughing triumphantly. "I like Tsutomo's driving; he's like Jason Statham! Misato's bad-ass like Angelina Jolie!" she added, referring to the stars' action movie roles.  
"我们碰上了一群业余的，就是这样！"她得意地笑道，"我喜欢筒本的驾驶技术；他就像杰森·斯坦森！美里就像安吉丽娜·朱莉一样酷！"她补充道，提到这些明星的动作电影角色。

"Maybe we're lucky," Shinji said, still feeling glum. "Except for this," he added as he pulled out of his pocket what was left of his SDAT player, literally crushed and bent, wired innards coming out and its LCD display shattered. The cassette inside was barely okay, though.  
"也许我们还算幸运，"真嗣仍然情绪低落地说，"除了这个，"他边说边从口袋里掏出他那被压得粉碎、弯曲变形的 SDAT 播放器，里面的电线裸露出来，液晶显示屏也碎了。不过里面的磁带还算完好。

"Oh," Asuka blurted. "That one? A pittance. You should've bought an iPod instead. SDATs are becoming passé."  
"哦，"明日香脱口而出，"那个啊？小意思。你本该买个 iPod 的。SDAT 已经过时了。"

"I should have…" Shinji trailed, suddenly wishing he had money to buy a new music player.  
"我本该……" 真嗣话音渐弱，突然希望自己有钱买个新的音乐播放器。

"Well, anyway..." Asuka said as she unzipped and dug into her backpack, and brought out her iPod and Skull Candy headphones, offering them to Shinji, who was suddenly wide-eyed. "This is yours from now on," she added.  
"总之……" 明日香一边说一边拉开背包拉链，从中掏出她的 iPod 和骷髅糖果耳机，递给真嗣，后者顿时瞪大了眼睛。"从现在起，这是你的了，"她补充道。

"Uh… Really?" he stammered.

Asuka nodded. "Yeah, it's yours now, officially. Don't worry about me; I'll buy myself a new one with the severance pay."  
明日香点头。"是啊，现在正式归你了。别担心我，我会用遣散费给自己买个新的。"

Shinji took hold of the iPod and quickly scrolled through the songs. He nodded and said, "Thanks again, Asuka."  
真嗣接过 iPod，迅速浏览着歌曲列表。他点头说道：“再次感谢你，明日香。”

Asuka smiled. "You're welcome. Apart from this mess we got into today, I also owe you much, especially with the mission down at the volcano. If it weren't for you, I would've been fried."  
明日香微笑道：“不客气。除了今天我们陷入的这团糟之外，我还欠你很多，尤其是在火山任务中。如果不是你，我早就被烤熟了。”

Shinji grinned back, genuinely glad as he put on the headphones, but then Misato, Makoto, Fuyutsuki and Kanzaki approached them. In the distance, Trudy Chacon, wearing a flight suit and helmet in hand, was waiting patiently along with her co-pilot, guzzling Gatorade as they stood in the shade beside her Cheyenne.  
真嗣回以微笑，戴上耳机时感到由衷的高兴，但这时美里、真琴、冬月和神崎向他们走来。远处，特鲁迪·查康身穿飞行服，手拿头盔，正耐心等待着，她的副驾驶也在一旁，两人站在她的夏安直升机旁的阴凉处，大口喝着佳得乐。

"What?" Shinji said, but he immediately knew what they were about to say next. "Ah, yeah, we're leaving, right?" he asked, sounding disappointed.  
“什么？” 真嗣说道，但他立刻明白他们接下来要说什么了。“啊，对，我们要走了，对吧？” 他问道，听起来有些失望。

Asuka suddenly looked sullen.  
明日香突然显得闷闷不乐。

Misato nodded and sighed. "Yeah, we're going," she said. "C'mon, we'll have to load much of your stuff in the gunship, Asuka. The plane's waiting there at the airport."  
美里点点头，叹了口气。“是的，我们要走了，”她说。“来吧，我们得把你的大部分东西装上炮艇，明日香。飞机已经在机场等着了。”

Rei took a nap, her head resting on Kaworu's chest as they were lying together on the bed. He could feel the rhythm of her breathing as she slumbered, his arm wrapped around her, the girl apparently contented with his warmth, but he was also thinking of the consequences of his actions.  
丽打了个盹，头枕在渚薰的胸膛上，两人一起躺在床上。他能感受到她熟睡时的呼吸节奏，他的手臂环绕着她，女孩显然对他的温暖感到满足，但他也在思考自己行为的后果。

Rei accepted his reasons, but he wondered if she would be able to handle the truth. He knew her origins and what role she would be playing soon, just as he always knew that he would be gambling his life to accomplish a goal. Maybe her heart would accept as he truly was, even if it may hurt her, for her own sake. Is it not that someone said that the truth would set one free?  
丽接受了他的理由，但他想知道她是否能承受真相。他了解她的出身以及她即将扮演的角色，正如他一直知道为了达成目标他将赌上自己的生命。也许她的心会接受他真正的样子，即使这可能会伤害她，为了她自己的利益。不是有人说过，真相会让人自由吗？

Before he fell asleep, Kaworu hoped that neither the Chairman nor the Commander should know of this forbidden love.  
在他入睡之前，渚薰希望无论是主席还是指挥官都不会知道这段禁忌之恋。

In his van parked somewhere in Mishima, a town south of Hakone, the killer was on a terse conversation on the phone with his handler, after he gave out a verbal report.  
在三岛市某处停放的货车里，杀手正与他的接头人进行着简短的电话交谈，此前他已经口头汇报了情况。

"We will give you one final chance," the handler said, his voice garbled. "One last chance."  
“我们会再给你一次机会，”接头人的声音模糊不清，“最后一次机会。”

"I know, boss," the killer answered. "At least we now know how they react."  
“我明白，老大，”杀手回答，“至少我们现在知道了他们的反应。”

The handler on the other side cleared his throat. "You maybe right, but still you must kill her. That is an order. You have to go inside or follow her by yourself. Do the job. Do anything you can to take her out. Time is running out for us—you have only three days."  
另一头的接头人清了清嗓子。“你或许是对的，但你必须杀了她。这是命令。你要么潜入，要么独自跟踪她。完成任务。尽你所能除掉她。我们时间不多了——你只有三天。”

"I'll do it. It's my damned responsibility… I'll get it done tonight."  
“我会做的。这是我的该死的责任……我今晚就搞定。”

"Otherwise, if you do not eliminate Miss Asuka Langley Soryu, Second Children, then we will send someone much smarter to eliminate you _and_ her. That's a promise, and we _always_ keep our promises."  
“否则，如果你不除掉第二适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷小姐，那么我们会派一个更聪明的人来除掉你和她。这是承诺，我们一向信守承诺。”

At Odawara International Airport, a huge UN Airbus A380 military cargo transport, taking in loads of palletized cargo bound for Frankfurt, waited for Asuka as the gunship landed on the tarmac. Once the engines wound down, they walked out of the rear ramp. While the adults led the way, pushing carts containing Asuka's belongings, both Children were discussing on how they could keep in touch.  
在小田原国际机场，一架巨大的联合国空客 A380 军用货机正等待着，它装载着运往法兰克福的托盘货物。当这架武装运输机降落在停机坪上时，阿斯卡随着引擎声逐渐减弱，从后坡道走了出来。大人们推着装有阿斯卡行李的推车走在前面，而两个孩子则在讨论如何保持联系。

"How could I contact you? Do you have a number?" He opened his phone and checked the address book. "Ah, wait, looks like I _do_ have your number," he corrected himself.  
“我怎么联系你呢？你有电话号码吗？”他打开手机查看通讯录，“啊，等等，看来我有你的号码，”他纠正自己说。

Asuka chuckled. "How forgetful you are, dummy," she muttered. "I already know your phone and email address, yet you don't have a Facebook account."  
阿斯卡轻声笑道：“你真是健忘，傻瓜，”她低语，“我已经知道你的电话和电子邮件地址了，但你连个 Facebook 账号都没有。”

"What?" Shinji blurted, stowing his phone back into the pocket.  
"什么？" 真嗣脱口而出，将手机重新放回口袋。

The redhead shook her head. "A Facebook account. Get yourself an account so that I could chat with you once I get back there. Almost everyone has one."  
红发女孩摇了摇头。"一个 Facebook 账号。给自己弄一个账号，这样我回去后就能和你聊天了。几乎每个人都有。"

"Ah, okay," he agreed. "I'll try."  
"啊，好的，" 他同意道。"我会试试。"

Asuka heaved a sigh. "You know what, Shinji?" she asked.  
明日香长叹一声。“你知道吗，真嗣？”她问道。

Shinji frowned a bit. "Yes?"

"I'm going to miss all of this," she said, feeling regretful. "I'll have to be content with watching what would happen soon back there in Tokyo-3."  
“我会想念这一切的，”她带着遗憾说道，“我只能满足于在东京-3 观看即将发生的事情。”

"I know," Shinji said. "I wished you could be there, but my father wrote down your fate."  
“我知道，”真嗣说，“我希望你能去，但我父亲已经决定了你的命运。”

"Yeah, your father," she said, displeased at how everything depended on the bearded cold-hearted bastard. "He's not going to change, right?"  
"是啊，你父亲，"她不满地说，对一切都依赖那个留着胡子的冷酷混蛋感到不快。"他不会改变的，对吧？"

Shinji shook his head. "No. Not a bit."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"不会。一点都不会。"

"But," Asuka said, "You're not your father's son. You're not like him. Certainly you don't want to fall into the same trap as he, do you?"  
"但是，"明日香说，"你不是你父亲的儿子。你和他不一样。当然，你不想落入和他一样的陷阱，对吧？"

"I don't want to wind up like him someday," Shinji answered, watching Misato and Fuyutsuki talk to the loadmaster and the cargo plane's pilot.  
"我不想有一天变得像他那样，" 真嗣回答道，目光落在美里和冬月与运输机装载员及飞行员交谈的身影上。

"Anyway," Asuka said. "Turns out you could change yourself and things for the better. You can be a better person, just as I am trying right now. You can also find happiness in many ways. But since you're an Eva pilot, understand that everyone's placing their hopes and dreams, looking up upon you to do the right thing, even those who don't know you and me as we busted our asses trying to beat the Angels. The spotlight's on you from now on."  
"总之，" 明日香说道，"事实证明，你可以改变自己，让事情变得更好。你可以成为一个更好的人，就像我现在正在努力的那样。你也可以通过多种方式找到幸福。但既然你是 EVA 驾驶员，就要明白，所有人都在把他们的希望和梦想寄托在你身上，期待你做出正确的选择，即使是那些不认识你我的人，也因为我们拼尽全力对抗使徒而仰望你。从现在开始，聚光灯将一直照在你身上。"

Shinji sighed. "I understand," he said.  
真嗣叹了口气。"我明白，" 他说。

"Regarding the gunfight back there, I made a mistake of saying the wrong things and words about you while we were in the car."  
"关于刚才的枪战，我在车上说了一些关于你的错话和词。"

"What did you say?"  
“你说什么？”

Asuka pursed her lips for a second. "I said 'hate' right in your face. Didn't know it still really hurts you. So again, I'm sorry, sometimes you're so sensitive you think some people insult you. When I saw you with that angry look on your face, you looked as if you were on berserker mode, but the next thing later I realized that you're not going to hurt me—you decided to fight back."  
明日香抿了抿嘴唇，片刻后说道：“我当时直接对你说了‘恨’这个字。没想到这还真的伤到了你。所以，再次道歉，有时候你太敏感了，总觉得别人在侮辱你。当我看到你脸上那愤怒的表情时，你看起来就像进入了狂战士模式，但很快我就意识到你不会伤害我——你决定反击。”

"I had to do what's right. I don't want to see you hurt again."  
"我必须做正确的事。我不想再看到你受伤了。"

"I know now. I understand what you did back there, so I apologize for the insult."  
"我现在明白了。我理解你当时所做的，所以为之前的冒犯道歉。"

"Thanks," Shinji said. "I forgive you."  
"谢谢，" 真嗣说。"我原谅你。"

"And, oh, yes… I didn't know you can shoot that good."  
"还有，哦，对了…我之前不知道你射击这么厉害。"

Shinji laughed a bit. "Blame it on Kensuke," he said. "Some of his military nuttiness gets to me. He showed me how to use that gun."  
真嗣轻声笑了笑。“怪健介吧，”他说，“他那股军事狂热劲儿有时会传染给我。他教我怎么用那把枪。”

"When?"

"When I first ran away, got stuck with him at his tent as he was playing soldier."  
“我第一次离家出走时，被困在他的帐篷里，看他玩士兵游戏。”

Asuka nodded. "I see," she said but noticed that Misato was gesturing at her to come. She figured that it was time to board the plane.  
明日香点点头。“我明白了，”她说，但注意到美里在向她招手示意过去。她猜是时候登机了。

"Shinji," Asuka said. "真嗣," 明日香说道。

"Yes?"

"Goodbye," she said, but feeling sorrowful. "I'm going to miss you all. I'll see you someday," the girl added as she walked away, waving her hand.  
"再见," 她说道，心中却感到悲伤。"我会想念你们所有人。总有一天会再见面的，" 女孩边走边挥手补充道。

Shinji sighed, knowing that Asuka had no choice except to accept her fate. "G… Goodbye, too, Asuka," he answered, his eyes feeling moist. "Farewell."  
真嗣叹了口气，知道明日香除了接受命运别无选择。"我…我也说再见，明日香，" 他回答道，眼眶湿润。"再见了。"

---

With the Cheyenne gunship parked behind them, Shinji and the others all stood a distance away from the massive cargo plane, its jet engines at quarter-power and ready to leave, Asuka glanced at the group for the last time, her backpack hanging on the shoulder, as she walked towards the plane. She looked sullen, feeling torn about leaving this town, wondering what may come by the time she wakes up back in Wilhelmshaven.  
身后停着夏安武装直升机，真嗣和其他人站在远离那架巨型运输机的一段距离外，其喷气发动机已调至四分之一功率，随时准备起飞。明日香最后一次瞥了众人一眼，背包斜挎在肩上，向飞机走去。她神情忧郁，对离开这座小镇感到矛盾，不知道醒来时回到威廉港会面临什么。

As she mounted the steps up to the plane's door, Asuka sighed, and then glanced at the crowd again, wondering when she would be seeing Shinji again. She didn't know, but in a single day they set aside their differences, and then fought side-by-side once more.  
当她踏上通往飞机舱门的台阶时，明日香叹了口气，再次望向人群，不知道何时才能再见到真嗣。她不清楚，但在短短一天内，他们放下了分歧，再次并肩作战。

Asuka closed her eyes, hesitating to get inside, wishing she could at least make her moment here last longer.  
明日香闭上眼睛，犹豫着是否进入机舱，希望至少能让此刻停留得更久一些。

When pushed to the limit, when his fear is stretched beyond tolerance, she realized, Shinji is transformed, and if someone he loves is hurt, he was willing to fight and defend. Asuka knew this, back in her biology class in college, because certain animals exhibit extraordinary abilities when they are in danger.  
当被逼到极限，当他的恐惧超越了忍耐的界限，她意识到，真嗣会发生变化，如果他爱的人受到伤害，他愿意战斗并保护。明日香在大学时的生物课上就知道这一点，因为某些动物在危险时会展现出非凡的能力。

Is it not when a hedgehog is in danger it needs to defend with its spines? But if he wishes to mate, he could find a way to couple himself to a female without hurting. Why not?  
刺猬不就是在危险时需要用刺来防御吗？但如果它想要交配，它也能找到一种方式与雌性结合而不造成伤害。为什么不呢？

Asuka finally understood.  
明日香终于明白了。

Here was someone, whom she once used to hate, but truthfully sensitive, gentle, compassionate, and with a passion for life, yet determined to fight if necessary; someone who, in a single day, sense was hammered into him, along with a lesson of self-love and encouragement given by a stranger, made manifest through his extraordinary actions; someone whose past was the same as hers, just as painful, just as traumatic; and someone who still has hope in his heart for redemption, self-respect—and love.  
这里有一位她曾经憎恨过的人，但实际上敏感、温柔、富有同情心，对生活充满热情，必要时又坚定地战斗；一位在短短一天内，被陌生人教会了自爱与鼓励，并通过其非凡行动体现出来的人；一位过去与她同样痛苦、同样创伤的人；以及一位心中仍怀有救赎、自尊——和爱的希望的人。

The fire she saw in Shinji's eyes in the heat of battle was the fire of passion to find respect and acceptance, to protect, to live, and to become a genuine person. He also avowed not to be too much of being his father's son, for the sins of the father are not the sins of the son.  
她在战斗中看到的真嗣眼中的火焰，是对尊重与接纳的渴望，是为了保护、生存和成为一个真正的人。他也发誓不要过于成为他父亲的影子，因为父辈的罪孽不应由子辈承担。

She stared at Shinji, who was slowly feeling the loneliness of being left behind. Misato also stood there besides him, completely morose, the woman presumably thinking back of the many months Asuka was with them. The other NERV officers stood by, with their own thoughts about her, and even Kozo Fuyutsuki was probably recalling the day when Shinji and Asuka once argued like a married couple before his presence.  
她凝视着真嗣，他正慢慢感受到被留下的孤独。美里也站在他旁边，完全忧郁，这位女士想必在回忆与明日香共度的数月时光。其他 NERV 的官员们也各自思索着关于她的事情，甚至连富士树也在可能回想着真嗣和明日香曾在他面前像夫妻一样争吵的那一天。

Then the memories came through her mind, mental snapshots of life while she was in Tokyo-3, some real and some imagined: at home with Misato and Shinji and that wacky bird Pen-Pen; at school with Hikari, glowering at the rest of the class; Toji and Kensuke hanging around, goofs as usual; at the Geofront, Rei staring at her, seemingly an unfeeling girl, yet breathing and her heart beating; Kaworu, smiling and kind-hearted; the Evas standing tall before her, man-made war machines, with scowls of defiance even in the face of grave catastrophe borne by the Angels.  
随后，记忆涌入她的脑海，东京-3 生活的精神快照，有些真实，有些虚幻：在家中与美里、真嗣和那只古怪的企鹅潘-潘共处；在学校与光一起，对班上其他人怒目而视；真治和健介一如既往地闲逛，傻笑着；在 Geofront，丽盯着她，看似无情的女孩，却呼吸着，心脏跳动着；薰，微笑着，心地善良；Eva 们高大挺立在她面前，人造的战争机器，即使在面对天使带来的灾难时也带着不服输的表情。

Asuka would be missing them all. Only memories to live by until the day she dies.  
明日香会想念他们所有人。只有记忆陪伴她直到生命终结。

But an unexpected thought struck her, and she opened her mouth wordlessly, but in her mind she made her final decision, for her heart was talking.  
但一个意外的想法击中了她，她无言地张开嘴，但在心中她做出了最终决定，因为她的心在说话。

Suddenly Asuka jumped off the steps, sprinted across the tarmac amidst the pleading calls of the loadmaster to return, arms wide open before she hugged Shinji Ikari tight. They spun together in that embrace, even as he was surprised at her gesture, before Asuka wordlessly let go of him.  
突然间，明日香从台阶上一跃而下，在装载员恳求她返回的呼喊声中，她飞奔过停机坪，双臂张开，紧紧拥抱住碇真嗣。他们在那个拥抱中旋转，尽管他因她的举动而感到惊讶，但明日香默默地放开了他。

Shinji stood there, wondering aloud. "What are you doing? You're supposed to go!"  
真嗣站在那里，大声疑惑道：“你在做什么？你应该走了！”

"No!" Asuka objected. "Not unless you kiss me!"  
“不！”明日香反驳道，“除非你吻我！”

The boy's jaw almost dropped. "Really?"  
男孩的下巴几乎要掉下来。“真的吗？”

She leaned close and whispered, "Do it right this time. I don't want any clichés anymore."  
她靠近并低声说：“这次要做得对。我再也不想要任何陈词滥调了。”

"O… Okay," he agreed, but Asuka kissed him instead. Not in the way they did it forcefully the first time around, but instead they locked lips in a natural manner. Shinji now remembered Misato's advice, and so he took her face with his hands, gently making contact with her lips before closing off their mouths. Asuka didn't mind his breath or hers; she simply went with the flow.  
“哦……好吧，”他同意了，但这次是明日香吻了他。不是像第一次那样强硬地进行，而是自然而然地双唇相接。真嗣现在想起了美里的话，于是他用双手捧起她的脸，温柔地触碰她的唇，然后闭上了他们的嘴。明日香并不介意他的呼吸或她的呼吸；她只是顺其自然。

The adults standing before them were astonished as they watched them for a minute. Shinji and Asuka slowly spun as they kissed, then embraced once more, as though they were dancing in a waltz, not wanting to waste a moment, but turn this moment into an event they can all remember.  
站在他们面前的成年人惊讶地看着他们，过了一分钟。真嗣和明日香缓缓旋转着亲吻，然后再次拥抱，仿佛在跳华尔兹，不愿浪费片刻，而是将这一刻变成他们所有人都能记住的事件。

And then they disengaged. Asuka sighed and confronted Misato and Fuyutsuki, both not sure how to react.  
然后他们分开了。明日香叹了口气，面对着美里和冬月，两人都不确定该如何反应。

"Sir, I want to try again," she said, determination in her voice.  
“先生，我想再试一次，”她坚定地说道。

"What?" Fuyutsuki asked, perplexed.  
"什么？" 冬月问道，一脸困惑。

"Give me a chance, Sub-Commander, I want to take another opportunity this time," Asuka declared. "I want to go _back!_"  
"给我一个机会，副司令，这次我想再试一次，" 明日香宣称。"我要回去！"

Fuyutsuki blinked. "You mean…? But…"  
冬月眨了眨眼。"你是说…？但是…"

Asuka stood straight, and said sternly, "I am Asuka Langley Soryu, Second Children, pilot of Evangelion Production Type Unit Two… And may I request for your permission for me to return to active duty, sir!"  
明日香站得笔直，严肃地说道：“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，福音战士二号机驾驶员……请问我可以请求您允许我重返现役吗，长官！”

Misato and Fuyutsuki stared at each other, still dumbfounded but otherwise trying to think what better to do. But since Fuyutsuki had as much authority as Gendo to lead people under his command, he also possessed the nominal right to accept, assign or discharge personnel as he sees fit, apart from being a secret member of the Marduk Institute selection board, whose responsibility was to search and select candidate Eva pilots.  
美里和冬月面面相觑，依旧目瞪口呆，但也在努力思考下一步该怎么做。既然冬月拥有与源渡相当的权威来领导其下属，他同样具备名义上的权利，可以根据自己的判断接受、指派或解雇人员，此外，作为马尔杜克机构选拔委员会的秘密成员，他的职责是寻找并选拔潜在的 EVA 驾驶员。

The old man sighed. "Miss Langley, can you state to me the reasons why do you wish to return?" he questioned.  
老人叹了口气。“兰格雷小姐，你能告诉我为什么想要回来吗？”他问道。

Asuka took a deep breath, and began to explain her decision. "I want to redeem myself, sir. I want to prove that I can do it again as a pilot, but this time with a clear conscience _and_ a pure heart. I have finally accepted what I am and my past, as my childhood was a tragic experience. Now that the people I spent time with, for better or worse, have forgiven me for offending them before, after I told them I was sorry, I am willing to put myself again into Unit Two."  
明日香深吸了一口气，开始解释她的决定。“我想赎回自己，长官。我想证明我还能作为一名飞行员再次做到，但这次是问心无愧、心灵纯净。我终于接受了自己是谁以及我的过去，我的童年是一段悲惨的经历。现在，那些与我共度时光的人，无论是好是坏，都原谅了我之前的冒犯，在我向他们道歉之后，我愿意再次投身于二号机。”

The redhead paused for a second. "Furthermore, sir, I have another reason," she added.  
红发女孩停顿了一下。“此外，长官，我还有另一个理由，”她补充道。

The Sub-Commander cocked an eye quizzically. "And what is it?"  
副司令挑起一只眼睛，好奇地问：“那是什么？”

Asuka turned her attention to Shinji, and stared at his eyes. There was a momentary lump in her throat before she spoke.  
明日香将注意力转向真嗣，凝视着他的眼睛。她喉咙里有一瞬间的哽咽，然后开口了。

"I love Shinji," she declared. "I finally understood his feelings. That's why I want to stay on, sir."  
“我爱真嗣，”她宣布道，“我终于理解了他的感受。这就是为什么我想留下来，长官。”

The young boy was speechless. He finally felt redemption.  
这个年轻的男孩无言以对。他终于感到了救赎。

"I… I love you as well," he responded, smiling. "Thanks."  
"我…我也爱你，" 他回答道，微笑着。"谢谢。"

Fuyutsuki sighed, wondering if Gendo would be able to accept the renewed defiance of the Second Children, but then he smiled and chuckled, before he cleared his throat. He would deal with Gendo later on this matter should he mentions it, even if he could catch hell. This was now _his_ command responsibility, and he will defend his actions and decisions.  
冬月叹了口气，不知道源堂是否能接受二号机驾驶员再次的反抗，但他随即微笑并轻笑出声，然后清了清嗓子。如果源堂提起这件事，他稍后会处理，即使可能会惹上麻烦。这是他作为指挥官的责任，他将捍卫自己的行动和决定。

"With the authority entrusted in me as Sub-Commander of Special Agency NERV, and with witnesses present, I accept your request, Miss Langley," he said. "We are now willing to give you another chance in Project E, reinstating you as a pilot. Welcome back to NERV."  
"作为 NERV 特殊机构的副指挥官，在授予我的权力下，并有在场证人的见证，我接受你的请求，兰格雷小姐，" 他说道。"我们现在愿意在 E 计划中再给你一次机会，恢复你作为驾驶员的身份。欢迎回到 NERV。"

As if on cue, the other NERV officers present all saluted at Asuka in unison, before Fuyutsuki gave her a salute as Shinji grinned, completely ecstatic. The boy felt as if he was about to cry in relief.  
仿佛是按了开关，在场所有 NERV 的官员齐刷刷地向明日香敬礼，随后福音津也向她敬礼，而真嗣则咧嘴笑着，完全沉浸在狂喜之中。男孩感觉自己快要激动得哭出来了。

"Now, I have to warn you both about this little problem of yours, though," Fuyutsuki harrumphed. Both Children did a double-take, blinking.  
“现在，我得提醒你们俩关于这个小问题，”福音津哼了一声。两个孩子都愣了一下，眨了眨眼。

"If in case you two are together," he said, forefinger upraised, "Please do not try to embarrass me, Children. Don't attempt to pull off those childish 'married couple' arguments right before my presence ever again. Behave like professionals, for you two are the only ones qualified for this job, and no one else can do what you are capable of. Is that clear?"  
“如果你们俩在一起的话，”他竖起食指说道，“请不要试图让我难堪，孩子们。不要再在我面前上演那些幼稚的‘夫妻’争吵了。表现得专业些，因为你们俩是唯一有资格做这份工作的人，没有其他人能胜任你们的能力。明白了吗？”

Facing Fuyutsuki, Asuka and Shinji nodded in unison. "Yes, sir," they promised.  
面对着冬月，明日香和真嗣齐齐点头。“是的，先生，”他们承诺道。

Then Asuka went fishing into her backpack, pulled out a pair of red interface headsets, took off the rubber band tying her hair, and wore each of the headsets to bunch her strands of hair until they were attached properly. She lifted her chin high, and the girl was now once more the regal and proud Asuka that Shinji remembered best.  
接着，明日香从背包里翻找出一对红色接口头戴式耳机，解开束住头发的橡皮筋，将每只耳机分别夹在发束上，直到固定妥当。她高昂着下巴，此刻的她再次变回了真嗣记忆中那个高贵而骄傲的明日香。

"How do I look?" she asked Shinji, who was already in tears and smiling.  
“我看起来怎么样？”她问真嗣，后者已经泪眼汪汪，却面带微笑。

"G… Great, just like back when I first met you," he said. "Welcome home, Asuka!"  
"太…太好了，就像我第一次遇见你时一样，"他说。"欢迎回家，明日香！"

Only then both Children hugged and wept upon their shoulders, while the adults around them cheered and clapped their hands in congratulation.  
只有那时，两个孩子才拥抱在一起，肩并肩地哭泣，而周围的成年人则欢呼鼓掌，表示祝贺。

Today was going to be Day One for the rest of Asuka's life.  
今天将是明日香余生的第一天。

Before continuing on to the Geofront, Kaworu and Rei decided together to visit the shore of the crater lagoon for a while. While not yet sunset, they walked down, hand in hand, up to the water's edge.  
在前往 Geofront 之前，渚薰和绫波零决定一起去火山口湖的岸边逗留片刻。虽然还未到日落时分，他们手牵手走到了水边。

It was nearly the same tranquil scene, like Kaworu had passed by days before, when he first met Shinji, of birds screeching above the diamond waves as they flew, while at the distance there were the burned-out hulks of the ruined buildings towering over the water. The sky was the color of LCL, with a tinge of blue and streaks of thin, feathery pink-white cirrus clouds.  
这几乎与几天前渚薰初次遇见真嗣时的宁静景象如出一辙，鸟儿在钻石般的波浪上空尖叫飞翔，远处是被烧毁的废墟建筑，高耸于水面之上。天空呈现出 LCL 的颜色，带着一丝蓝色和几缕细薄的粉白色卷云。

"Here we are," Kaworu informed as he took off his sneakers and socks, cuffing the legs of his pants up to his knees. "There's something pleasant about having the water swirl around your feet."  
“我们到了，”渚薰边说边脱下运动鞋和袜子，卷起裤腿至膝盖。“让水流环绕在脚边，有种愉悦的感觉。”

Rei nodded, and she promptly unshod her shoes, and then stuffed the socks inside.  
丽点点头，随即脱下鞋子，将袜子塞了进去。

And so they walked together along the shore, shoes in hand, the waves lapping and splashing on their pale legs, with the grains of sand playfully dancing on their toes and soles. There was something alive and warm about the bare feet touching the wet sand of the earth meeting the water.  
于是他们一起沿着海岸行走，手中提着鞋子，海浪轻轻拍打着他们苍白的双腿，沙粒在脚趾和脚底间欢快地跳跃。赤脚踏在湿润的沙地上，感受着大地与海水的交融，那种生机与温暖油然而生。

While they walked, Kaworu asked the girl. "Have you ever thought of swimming in the sea?"  
他们行走时，薰向女孩问道：“你有没有想过在海里游泳？”

Rei shook her head gently. "No, I always swam in the pool, because it was necessary that I must be present at Headquarters most of the time, should they need me."  
丽轻轻摇了摇头。“不，我总是在泳池里游泳，因为大多数时候我必须待在总部，以防他们需要我。”

Kaworu chuckled, shaking his head. "Too bad, we should try it someday," he suggested.  
薰轻笑一声，摇了摇头。“太可惜了，我们应该找个时间试试，”他提议道。

"Yes, I will. If the Commander allows me to do so," Rei answered.  
“是的，我会去的。如果司令允许的话，”丽回答道。

"But..." Kaworu trailed off. "Even if you say you don't trust his judgment, you'll be having problems if you depend too much on Commander Ikari."  
"但是……" 渚薰欲言又止。"即使你说你不信任他的判断，如果你过于依赖碇司令，你也会遇到问题的。"

"Why?"

"What are you going to do when the time comes that the Commander _no longer_ needs you?"  
"当司令不再需要你的时候，你打算怎么办？"

Rei paused in her tracks. It was an uncertainty she could be facing anytime. She spent years committing herself to the sacred importance of Project E, her life completely preordained for the task, and never once she entertained any thoughts of becoming what she really wanted to be; no thought for her own future, which meant that there maybe no place for Rei to go on with her life.  
绫波丽停下了脚步。这是一个她随时可能面对的不确定性。她多年来全身心投入到 E 计划的崇高重要性中，她的生活完全被预定来完成这项任务，从未有过任何成为她真正想成为的人的想法；没有考虑过自己的未来，这意味着绫波丽可能没有地方继续她的生活。

The blue-haired girl looked glum. "I do not know. I am not a naïve dreamer."  
蓝发女孩看起来很沮丧。“我不知道。我不是个天真的梦想家。”

Kaworu blinked. "Why?" 渚薰眨了眨眼。“为什么？”

"I admit that I am nothing. I dream nothing beyond of what I only know, and I do not dream about my future," Rei admitted, downcast. "I was an instrument that the Commander needed to fulfill his plans, and once I complete my purpose, I return to nothing."  
“我承认我什么都不是。我只梦想我所知道的，不梦想我的未来，”绫波零承认道，情绪低落。“我是指挥官为了完成他的计划所需的工具，一旦我完成了我的使命，我就回归虚无。”

"But Rei..." Kaworu trailed off.  
"但丽..." 渚薰的声音渐渐低了下去。

"However I am still myself, even if I sometimes believe that I am just nothing," Rei whispered instead, cutting him off, while the hem of her navy blue skirt was blown across by the breeze. "I have become myself through the instrumentality of the links between me and everybody else, and I have been formed by interaction with other people."  
"尽管如此，我依然是我自己，即便有时我觉得自己一无是处，" 丽轻声打断了他，海军蓝裙摆随风飘动。"我通过与他人之间的联系实现了自我，在与他人的互动中塑造了自我。"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, that makes you unique," he agreed. "However, I fear that there's someone else who's your true identity, the one you have to see because I felt _her_ presence. You don't know _her_, because you don't want to see that, so you were trying to escape."  
渚薰点头。"是的，这让你独一无二，"他赞同道。"然而，我担心还有另一个你的真实身份，那个你必须见到的人，因为我感受到了她的存在。你不认识她，因为你不想看到这一点，所以你一直在试图逃避。"

Somewhere, Kaworu sensed a nether region within Rei, which he decided it best not to reveal to her until later; except for some small hints he was giving to her at the moment.  
在某处，渚薰感知到了丽体内的一片幽暗领域，他决定最好暂时不向她透露，除非此刻他正向她暗示些许。

"Because I fear something?"  
“因为我害怕什么吗？”

Kaworu nodded. "Unfortunately, yes, through your eyes, I can feel the fear in your heart. You have to discover and confront your true identity."  
渚薰点头。“不幸的是，是的，通过你的眼睛，我能感受到你心中的恐惧。你必须发现并面对你的真实身份。”

There was a pause before Rei realized why. Her eyes repeatedly blinked.  
有一阵停顿，随后丽明白了原因。她的眼睛反复眨动。

"I... I do fear something," Rei said. "Because I feel that she might not have a human shape. Because the present self that is of my existence might disappear. That is what I am truly afraid of."  
"我...我确实害怕某件事，"丽说。"因为我感觉她可能没有人类的形态。因为现在的自我可能会消失。那才是我真正害怕的。"

"You're afraid of it?" Kaworu asked.  
"你害怕它吗？"薰问道。

Rei sadly shook her head. "N... No," she answered. "I am glad... I wished to die, and all I needed was despair and nothingness."  
丽悲伤地摇了摇头。“不……不，”她回答道，“我很高兴……我曾希望死去，我所需要的只是绝望和虚无。”

"Ayanami, you can't," Kaworu disagreed. "You can't be nothing or die for it. You can't allow yourself to be nothing; you're _not expendable_. You have to stand bravely for yourself."  
“绫波，你不能这样，”渚薰反对道，“你不能化为虚无或为此死去。你不能让自己变得无足轻重；你并非可有可无。你必须勇敢地为自己而战。”

For a moment they locked eyes, letting Kaworu to read out what sorrow she was feeling at the moment.  
有那么一刻，他们目光交汇，让渚薰读出了她此刻的悲伤。

Kaworu frowned. "That can't be you. You still have a lot to live for," he pleaded.  
渚薰皱起眉头。“那不可能是你。你还有很多活下去的理由，”他恳求道。

Downcast, yet Rei looked up into Kaworu's eyes. "I have hoped for the day, the day that I may finally face my very end, although I am unsure how. How in any way I could accept my fate."  
虽然沮丧，但绫波零还是抬头望向渚薰的眼睛。“我一直期待着那一天，那一天我终于可以面对自己的终结，尽管我不确定如何面对。我该如何接受我的命运。”

Kaworu turned away for a moment to watch the setting sun sink into the horizon. "Rei," he whispered.  
渚薰转过身去，凝视着夕阳沉入地平线。“绫波，”他低声说道。

"Yes?"

"I've seen you as a living person inside with a very strong will," Kaworu said. "You put that will through duty and dedication many times before, even if it could cost your life—or it has. It is also your very strength, just like the strength and beauty of well-woven silk, and I'm not kidding. But I truly believe that you can use that same will to define your identity, your life and reciprocate for the people you think you love, who can also love you in return."  
"我曾见过你内心深处那股强烈的意志，"渚薰说道。"你多次将这份意志投入到职责与奉献中，即便这可能危及你的生命——或者已经如此。这正是你的力量所在，就像精心编织的丝绸所展现的力量与美丽，我绝非戏言。但我真心相信，你可以运用同样的意志来定义你的身份、你的生活，并回馈那些你认为你所爱的人，他们也能以爱回报你。"

Kaworu sighed before he continued. "It may be trite, but I came here not because I was told to do what my superiors wanted at their insistence. I finally realized why I was here for."  
渚薰叹了口气，继续说道。"或许这话有些陈词滥调，但我来到这里并非因为上级一再要求我执行他们的意愿。我终于明白了自己为何会在这里。"

Rei nodded, agreeing with what he confessed.  
绫波点点头，对他的坦白表示认同。

"Rei... I admit that I really wanted to keep on helping you all," he explained carefully. "Because I don't want to be selfish, I can't afford myself to just stand here and watch all of you suffer. I have seen it on their faces and on your face, in their eyes and in your eyes, and they told me that they've lost their sense of direction that I must help them see their way once more."  
"丽...我承认我真的很想继续帮助你们所有人，"他小心翼翼地解释道。"因为我不希望自己变得自私，我不能让自己只是站在这里看着你们受苦。我在他们的脸上、在你的脸上，在他们的眼中、在你的眼中看到了这一切，他们告诉我他们已经迷失了方向，我必须帮助他们重新找到自己的道路。"

Rei blinked. "You mean…?"  
丽眨了眨眼。"你是说…？"

"I have the strength and the will unlike the rest of you, but I want to humbly share these, and continue to do so, because the day of reckoning that we have to face is coming soon, and if necessary, I may have to sacrifice myself so that all of you will live on."  
"我拥有不同于你们的力量和意志，但我希望谦逊地分享这些，并继续这样做，因为我们要面对的审判之日即将来临，如果有必要，我可能不得不牺牲自己，以便你们所有人能够继续生存下去。"

"Like me? Is it for me? And is it for everyone?"  
"像我吗？是为我准备的吗？还是为所有人？"

Out of a need to make her understand, Kaworu gently let his hands rest on Rei's shoulders and whispered. "Yes, I do, because I care and I love you. Because I can feel within my heart the pain that all of you have shared to me. So trust me once more, soon we may have to help Shinji and Asuka fight through their most difficult time of their lives."  
为了让她明白，渚薰温柔地将双手放在绫波的肩上，低声说道：“是的，我愿意，因为我关心你，我爱你。我能感受到你们所有人与我分享的痛苦。所以请再次相信我，不久我们可能需要帮助真嗣和明日香度过他们生命中最艰难的时刻。”

"Yes," she agreed, "just as I have committed myself defending them from harm."  
"是的，"她同意道，"正如我曾发誓保护他们免受伤害一样。"

"Well, it's going to be you and me to set things right," Kaworu promised. "For you, I will."  
"好吧，看来得由你我来纠正这一切了，" 渚薰承诺道。"为了你，我会的。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

For a moment, Rei stared at Kaworu with her soft red eyes, smiled in return, before she leaned up to him, close to his face and kissed him again, but then Kaworu slowly embraced her, the lake water splashing upon their feet, with the backdrop of the setting sun shining down.  
有那么一会儿，绫波丽用她柔和的红色眼眸凝视着渚薰，微笑着回应，随后她靠近他，脸颊贴近，再次吻了他，而渚薰则缓缓地拥抱着她，湖水在他们脚边溅起，夕阳的余晖洒落下来，构成了一幅美丽的背景。

**Author's Notes:** Finally! Some parts of this chapter were originally bits and pieces of first-draft Chapter 10+=* (six years ago), just before I decided to change things, and some were scenes I envisioned as I was writing the new season, such as the car chase and Asuka's departure. I'm sure some of you would also recognize fragments or themes that were from the TV show.  
作者的话：终于完成了！这部作品中的一些部分最初是六年前我决定改变方向之前的初稿片段，还有一些是我构思新一季时设想的场景，比如汽车追逐和明日香的离开。我相信你们中的一些人也能认出来自电视剧的片段或主题。

In case you noticed, lately a certain book (and eventual movie adaptation) is lending influence as I wrote, especially on the romantic parts.  
如果你注意到了，最近某本书（及其最终的电影改编）在我写作时提供了影响，尤其是在浪漫的部分。

Well, since the last 4 chapters I was surprised at the flow of the dialogue, and able to construct it right off the bat with only a cup of coffee, as opposed to the first time I wrote the first 8 chapters six years ago, blindly trying to make a conversation work. To aspiring writers, if you wish to be respected, it help to read about 10 to 60 fiction books a year to find your writing style, and write what you know, as long as you have William Strunk's primer with you.  
好吧，自从最后四章以来，我对对话的流畅感到惊讶，能够直接构建起来，只需一杯咖啡，而不是像六年前我第一次写前八章时那样，盲目地试图让对话成立。对于有志成为作家的人，如果你想得到尊重，每年阅读 10 到 60 本小说来寻找你的写作风格是有帮助的，并且写你所知道的，只要你手头有威廉·斯特伦克的入门书。

With all this kissing and shooting, I hope that I got the character development right for you. Thank you once again for coming this far.  
在这充满亲吻与射击的情节中，我希望我正确地把握了角色的成长。再次感谢你一路相伴。

This chapter's dedicated to Axel and Myssa, the folks at , and to all the A/S and K/R fans out there.

Walking hand-in-hand, Kaworu and Rei were a bit surprised when they came at Gate 18. There were now some body searches, as the sentries frisked and waved their metal detector wands over the bodies of those lining up to enter, while another group of sentries were busy setting up a walk-in metal detector and an x-ray machine. One sentry standing guard even had a bomb-sniffing dog on a leash.  
手牵手走着，渚薰和绫波丽来到 18 号门前时有些惊讶。现在有了人身检查，哨兵们对排队进入的人进行搜身，并用金属探测器在他们身上挥舞，同时另一组哨兵正忙着设置步入式金属探测器和 X 光机。一名站岗的哨兵甚至牵着一只炸弹嗅探犬。

While he watched Rei being frisked by a female sentry, despite the girl being a minor and a member of Project E, Kaworu asked the male sentry, who was finished checking him out. He noticed that the sentry was wearing body armor and an MP5 submachine gun dangling from a shoulder harness.  
当他看着绫波被一名女哨兵搜身时，尽管她还是个未成年且是 E 计划的一员，渚薰向刚检查完他的男哨兵问道。他注意到这名哨兵穿着防弹衣，肩带上挂着一把 MP5 冲锋枪。

"I was wondering, sir, but what's going on?" he inquired.  
"先生，我在想，这是怎么回事？" 他询问道。

The sentry cocked an eye. "It's a yellow alert today, can't you see, son? Some bunch of nutcase terrorists attacked a convoy."  
哨兵斜睨了一眼。"今天发布黄色警报，你没看见吗，小子？一群疯子恐怖分子袭击了一个车队。"

Indeed, a scrolling LED ticker above the gate showed the current security status, warning all NERV personnel to take necessary precautions and stay alert for further announcements.  
确实，大门上方滚动的 LED 显示屏显示了当前的安全状态，提醒所有 NERV 人员采取必要预防措施，并保持警惕，等待进一步通知。

Kaworu looked worried. "When?"  
渚薰看起来很担忧。“什么时候？”

"This afternoon," he said. "The nuts nearly wiped out all the escorts save for the VIP car, or so I was told by a Section Two suit passing here. Those passengers in the VIP car took on the bastards with their guns like they were swatting flies."  
“今天下午，”他说。“那些暴徒几乎摧毁了所有护卫车辆，只剩下 VIP 车幸免，这是我从一个路过这里的二科人员那里听说的。VIP 车上的乘客们用枪对付那些家伙，就像拍苍蝇一样。”

Worried, Kaworu turned to Rei, who was done being searched. Once they were together, swiping their cards through the turnstiles and walked towards the elevators, he told her what was wrong.  
渚薰担心地转向绫波，她已经完成了搜查。两人一起刷卡通过旋转门，走向电梯时，他告诉她发生了什么事。

"Shinji and the others got themselves in trouble," he said.  
"真嗣和其他人遇到了麻烦，"他说道。

Rei suddenly looked concerned. "Are they doing fine?" she asked.  
绫突然显得担忧。"他们还好吗？"她问道。

Kaworu shook his head. "I don't know. The sentry only had some third-hand information. Let's just hope you're right, maybe we'll meet them here instead to make sure they're okay, or we try to ask someone who's close to Major Katsuragi."  
薰摇了摇头。"我不清楚。哨兵只得到了一些间接消息。我们只能希望你是对的，或许我们会在这里遇到他们，确认他们是否安然无恙，或者我们试着向接近葛城少校的人打听一下。"

"What is the meaning of this?" Gendo Ikari demanded from Director Hamamoto, who was standing still before him. He was summoned up to the office for a security briefing about the ambush after a day of self-reflection down at Terminal Dogma.  
“这是什么意思？”碇源堂向站在面前的哈马塔莫导演质问道。他被召到办公室参加关于伏击的安全简报，此前一天他在终末教条区进行了自我反省。

"Sir, the IR attack was unexpected," Hamamoto said, trying not to be fazed by the Iceman's freezing stare. "Somehow a mole must've heard about the convoy and then relayed to the terrorist group, then attempted to assassinate the Children. Again, we're trying our best to find out where the leak came from, but I'm sure there's somebody who's big enough to finance such an attack to be carried out here."  
“长官，红外线攻击是意料之外的，”哈马塔莫说道，尽量不被冰人的冰冷目光所动摇。“一定是有内鬼听说了车队的情况，然后通知了恐怖组织，试图再次暗杀孩子们。我们正在尽最大努力找出泄密的源头，但我确信一定有足够大的势力资助了这次在这里实施的袭击。”

Hamamoto checked his own copy of his report, and read off the casualty figures. "Right now we managed to capture three of them, ID'd one, and they're currently being grilled, but the rest of the terrorist cell has been killed, and they're been two dozen of them at the time of the attack. Most of them were probably American, Middle Eastern, Russian or European. Unfortunately on our side, we have four men killed, sixteen injured, with three probably in serious condition. I've made arrangements to inform the relatives of those who died in the operation."  
滨本检查了自己的报告副本，念出了伤亡数字。“目前我们设法抓获了其中三人，确认了一人的身份，他们正在接受审讯，但其余的恐怖分子已被击毙，当时他们有二十四人。他们很可能来自美国、中东、俄罗斯或欧洲。不幸的是，我们这边有四人牺牲，十六人受伤，其中三人情况可能很严重。我已经安排通知那些在行动中牺牲人员的家属。”

Gendo sighed, trying to control his seething anger. "Even if they claim to be IR terrorists, find out who's behind this and know precisely what they're targeting at," he directed. "These security lapses are becoming intolerable."  
源度叹了口气，试图控制自己沸腾的怒火。“即使他们声称是 IR 恐怖分子，也要查出幕后黑手，并确切了解他们的目标是什么，”他指示道。“这些安全漏洞已经变得无法容忍。”

"Yes, sir," Hamamoto answered. "We're taking all measures possible."  
“是，长官，”滨本回答。“我们正在采取一切可能的措施。”

"And one more thing, Director," Gendo harrumphed, as he picked up a piece of paper and showed it to the Director. "What is this shipment I heard about that arrived here just recently? Why does this shipment includes _heavy military weapons and munitions_?"  
"还有一件事，指挥官，" 源堂哼了一声，拿起一张纸展示给指挥官看。"我听说最近这里到了一批货物？为什么这批货物包括重型军事武器和弹药？"

"Oh, I apologize for that, sir," Hamamoto blurted, realizing the cat was now out of the bag. He sighed, but he felt confident this time, not afraid of being thrown out of NERV should Ikari refuses his input.  
"哦，对此我深表歉意，先生，" 滨本脱口而出，意识到秘密已经泄露。他叹了口气，但这次他感到自信，不再害怕如果碇拒绝他的建议会被赶出 NERV。

"Sir," the old Director began, "I'll be frank with you for the first time: NERV is supposed to be a military organization, and our quality of security against armed intrusions is just only good for small ragtag terrorist cells, just like the IR who hit our convoy. Now, barring the typical Angels, what if there's a _human_ threat _bigger_ than those groups? And considering that we're almost winning the battle against Angels, what's going to happen by the time we're done with all of them, and how we would deal with that conclusion?"  
"先生，" 老指挥官开始说道，"我第一次坦率地告诉你：NERV 本应是一个军事组织，而我们对抗武装入侵的安全性仅对小型杂牌恐怖分子有效，就像袭击我们车队的那些人。现在，除了典型的使徒，如果有人类威胁比这些团体更大呢？考虑到我们几乎要赢得对抗使徒的战斗，当我们全部解决完他们之后，会发生什么，我们又将如何应对那个结局？"

Gendo could only respond with a patent murmur, realizing that the question has hit him squarely. There was enough money for everything but _security_.  
源度只能含糊其辞地回应一声，意识到这个问题正中他的要害。一切都有足够的资金，唯独安全方面不足。

"Because we have a big budget, sir, approved by the UN and good for five years, isn't it natural that we have to beef up our security forces apart from allocating money for infrastructure, salaries, and the Evas?" Hamamoto said. "That's why we chose to fudge the accounting figures, go under the table and do just that. I want to make damn sure that the troops are properly equipped and armed just in case. The last thing we want is a worst-case scenario where we are caught with our pants down, considering that not everyone in the UN likes the way we spend their money."  
“因为我们有一个由联合国批准、为期五年的大预算，先生，除了为基础设施、薪资和 EVA 分配资金外，加强我们的安保力量难道不是理所当然的吗？”哈马莫托说道，“这就是为什么我们选择篡改会计数字，暗中操作并做到这一点。我想要确保部队在必要时能够得到适当的装备和武装。考虑到联合国中并非所有人都喜欢我们花钱的方式，我们最不希望的就是在最坏的情况下被抓个措手不及。”

The Supreme Commander could only manage a frustrated sigh. After many misgivings and mistakes, Hamamoto was right this time.  
最高指挥官只能无奈地叹了口气。经过多次疑虑和错误后，哈马莫托这次说得没错。

"Who approved this black budget?" Gendo asked.  
“谁批准了这个黑色预算？”源度问道。

"The Sub-Commander, sir," Hamamoto answered. "Because I suggested this scheme to him. We intend that we must be prepared for _any_ contingencies in the near future, even the unthinkable."  
“副司令，长官，”滨本回答，“因为我向他提出了这个计划。我们打算必须为不久的将来可能发生的任何意外做好准备，哪怕是难以想象的。”

---

Kaworu and Rei didn't know that their Project E teammates were at home instead, as Trudy Chacon had earlier dropped off Misato, Tsutomo and the Children near the woman's flat before flying back to base with the Sub-Commander and the others onboard.  
渚薰和绫波并不知道他们的 E 计划队友们其实在家，因为特鲁迪·查康之前已经把美里、堤文和孩子们送到了那位女士的公寓附近，然后带着副司令和其他人飞回了基地。

At the moment, Tsutomo kept guard at Misato's flat, on Fuyutsuki's orders, armed with the UMP45 submachine gun they used earlier in the chase; the base had declared yellow alert for 24 hours until further notice. While sitting on the couch in the living room, watching a Beat Takeshi comedy show on TV, he could smell Shinji's cooking from the kitchen as the young boy was preparing dinner for four.  
此刻，遵照冬月副司令的命令，筒友守在美里小姐的公寓里，手持他们在追捕中使用过的 UMP45 冲锋枪；基地已宣布黄色警戒状态将持续 24 小时，直至另行通知。他坐在客厅的沙发上，看着电视上北野武的喜剧节目，同时能闻到厨房里真嗣正在为四人准备晚餐的香味。

"That's chicken teriyaki?" the agent asked.  
“那是照烧鸡吗？”特工问道。

"Yeah," Shinji said as he cooked the marinated chicken in a skillet on the range, adding some sauce before tasting it by picking a small piece of meat using a pair of cooking chopsticks.  
“嗯，”真嗣一边回答，一边在炉子上的平底锅中烹饪腌好的鸡肉，加入一些酱汁后，用一双烹饪筷夹起一小块肉品尝味道。

Meanwhile Asuka came out of the shower, feeling fresh, wearing a pair of shorts and her habitual loose yellow shirt, as she dried her hair with a towel. She sniffed the air and smiled. "Not bad, nicely spiced," the girl remarked as she read the recipe tacked to the fridge with a magnet. "Where did you get the recipe?"  
与此同时，明日香洗完澡走了出来，感觉神清气爽，穿着一条短裤和那件她习惯的宽松黄色衬衫，一边用毛巾擦着头发。她嗅了嗅空气，微笑道：“不错，调味得很好，”女孩看着冰箱上用磁铁固定着的食谱说道，“这食谱你从哪儿弄来的？”

"I just picked it up on someone's blog," Shinji said, still paying attention to his cooking.  
“我刚从某个人的博客上看到的，”真嗣回答，依然专注于他的烹饪。

"I see," Asuka said. "At least you still know what you're doing."  
“原来如此，”明日香说，“至少你还知道自己该做什么。”

The boy grinned. "I'd credit this to our home economics teacher."  
男孩咧嘴一笑。“我会把这归功于我们的家政老师。”

"To gain nice-guy points?" she asked, sounding amused.  
“为了赢得好男人分数？”她问道，听起来觉得有趣。

Shinji chuckled. "Maybe soon I should ask Toji to attend home economics classes for him to gain respect from Hikari, and you know her."  
真嗣轻笑道：“也许不久后我该让东治去参加家政课，好让他赢得光里的尊重，你知道她的。”

"One can't be a gourmet if he can't cook," Asuka added, before laughing.  
"不会做饭的人算不上美食家，"明日香补充道，随后笑了起来。

As he cooked, Shinji was glad that a measure of normalcy, barring the absence of Pen-Pen, was restored in the Katsuragi household. He could hear Misato in her bedroom, busy answering a seemingly endless parade of phone calls that demanded her to explain today's unexpected events, and how best to deal with it.  
做饭时，真嗣很高兴卡茨拉吉家恢复了一些正常，除了没有企鹅 Pen-Pen 之外。他可以听到美里在她卧室里，忙着接听一连串似乎永无止境的电话，要求她解释今天意外的事件，以及如何最好地应对。

"…and grill them while you can. Yes, I know. I don't care if these bastards are claiming to be volunteers; we need to know who bankrolled the attack and who did the inside job. It takes a great deal of cash to launch such a kamikaze attack here. Yes, I'll try to come down there later; I'll fix his ass if he doesn't crack up…"  
"……并且趁热烤了它们。是的，我知道。我不在乎这些混蛋是否自称志愿者；我们需要知道是谁资助了这次袭击，谁是内鬼。在这里发动如此规模的自杀式袭击需要大量资金。是的，我稍后会尽量过去；如果他不崩溃，我会让他崩溃……"

While keeping the meat on low heat, Shinji went to the rice cooker and checked if it was still cooking, opening the lid to be sure. _Well, okay, it's ready_, he thought, seeing that the rice was done, before he laid out the plates and the utensils on the table. He then sighed, and told himself, _It's a bit awkward after all the danger we had today, like when we were then eating together, and Asuka's stepmother called up._  
在保持肉用小火慢炖的同时，真嗣走到电饭煲前，检查是否还在煮饭，打开盖子确认。嗯，好了，他想，看到米饭已经煮好，然后他在桌上摆好盘子和餐具。接着他叹了口气，自言自语道，今天经历了那么多危险，现在一起吃饭还是有点尴尬，就像那时我们在一起吃饭，明日香的后妈打来电话一样。

Shinji went back to the teriyaki and worked on browning the meat. As he did, although he was surprisingly unperturbed by his earlier actions on the road, he wondered what Rei and Kaworu were doing throughout the afternoon while their car was being peppered with bullets.  
真嗣回到照烧肉旁，开始煎至肉表面微焦。过程中，尽管他对之前在路上所做的事情感到意外的平静，但他还是想知道下午丽和薰在他们的车被子弹扫射时都在做些什么。

Back down in the Geofront, down at Level B-20, Kaworu asked Makoto Hyuga, who stopped for them while carrying a bunch of reports, having come from the Command Center, which was busy assessing the terrorist attack on the convoy.  
回到地下的 Geofront，在 B-20 层，薰问正在搬运一堆报告的加持真，他从指挥中心过来，那里正忙于评估针对车队的恐怖袭击。

"Where's Shinji and Asuka, and Misato, too?" he asked, as Rei stood besides him, listening.  
"真嗣、明日香和美里呢？" 他问道，丽站在他身边，静静地听着。

Makoto sighed, still hefting the load on his hands. "They're home," he said. "The Sub-Commander assigned them an agent to guard them while they rest until tomorrow once the yellow alert is lifted. Well, earlier they managed to fight off the terrorists chasing them, and the two Cheyenne pilots helped save the day."  
真琴叹了口气，依旧双手托着重物。"他们在家，"他说，"副指挥官给他们分配了一名特工，在黄色警报解除前保护他们休息到明天。之前他们成功击退了追捕他们的恐怖分子，那两位夏安飞行员也帮忙拯救了局面。"

"Why would someone kill them?" Kaworu was perplexed. Perhaps someone powerful was ruthless enough to give orders to kill them. But exactly who?  
"为什么会有人想杀他们？" 渚薰感到困惑。或许是某个有权势的人冷酷到足以下令杀害他们。但究竟是谁呢？

The bespectacled officer shrugged. "I have no idea, so the investigation's still ongoing. So far we're looking into leads."  
戴眼镜的警官耸了耸肩。“我毫无头绪，所以调查仍在进行中。目前我们正在跟进线索。”

Kaworu thought of Asuka, who earlier decided to quit NERV. "Is Asuka still here, yet willing to leave?"  
渚薰想起了明日香，她之前决定离开 NERV。“明日香还在这里吗，还是愿意离开？”

Makoto shook his head. "No, she changed her mind. She decided to stay on instead, so the Sub-Commander reinstated her on the spot. She wanted to take a shot at piloting Unit Two again."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不，她改变了主意。她决定留下来，于是副司令当场恢复了她的职位。她想再次尝试驾驶二号机。”

"That's good news," Kaworu said. "If somebody's looking for us, tell them we're taking a break at the swimming pool… We needed to relax."  
"那是个好消息," 渚薰说。"如果有人在找我们，告诉他们我们在游泳池休息…我们需要放松一下。"

Makoto nodded. "Okay, I got you and will tell them, so I've got to go now," he said before walking away.  
真嗣点点头。"好的，我明白了，会告诉他们的，那我现在得走了，" 他说完便离开了。

"Thanks," Kaworu said, before turned his attention to Rei.  
"谢谢，" 渚薰说，随后将注意力转向了绫波。

"You will have to follow me. I know the way," she said.  
"你得跟着我。我知道路。" 她说。

It took Kaworu and Rei about five minutes to locate an out-of-the-way elevator, which was unmarked yet totally secured with an electronic lock. To gain entry, she entered a password on the lock's keypad, and then swiped her ID card through its slot before the elevator door opened.  
碇和绫大约花了五分钟找到一个偏僻的电梯，它没有标记，但完全用电子锁保护着。为了进入，她在锁的键盘上输入了一个密码，然后通过插槽刷了她的身份证，电梯门才打开。

"Who's using this?" Kaworu questioned.  
"谁在使用这个？" 碇问道。

"Only the Commander, the Sub-Commander and Doctor Akagi, apart from me, have access," Rei said as she pressed a button going down.  
“除了我，只有司令、副司令和赤木博士有权限进入，”绫波按下按钮说道，电梯开始下行。

The elevator doors closed and the car began to move downwards, almost dropping fast like a rock as it was an express elevator. The level indicator flashed the numbers quickly as they descended, until the car stopped gently. Now the doors opened, and Kaworu was greeted by a hallway that was barely-lit by a solitary fluorescent lamp and an emergency exit sign. He could also smell a mustiness that was matched only by Rei's home.  
电梯门关闭后，轿厢迅速下降，快得几乎像自由落体，这是一部高速电梯。随着他们下降，楼层指示灯快速闪烁，直到轿厢平稳停下。门一开，真嗣便看到一条昏暗的走廊，仅由一盏荧光灯和紧急出口标志勉强照亮。他还闻到了一股与绫波家相仿的霉味。

On the wall were the words _Artificial Evolution Laboratory – Third Annex_, which meant this abandoned facility was older than NERV, before the larger organization came into being.  
墙上的字样写着“人工进化实验室——第三分部”，这意味着这座废弃设施比 NERV 更为古老，是在更大规模的组织成立之前就存在的。

"This way," Rei said as she led the way, with Kaworu looking around while he had his hand clasped on hers. He also feigned curiosity, remembering the mental images he had in his mind, using them to construct an imaginary map.  
“这边走，”丽说道，引领着道路，而渚则环顾四周，手紧握着她的。他假装好奇，脑海中的画面被用来构建一张虚构的地图。

They went around carts that were parked on the side, spangled with cobwebs. There were also stacks of boxes, and capped gas cylinders and drums that haven't even been touched. The rooms along the hall had closed doors, but some of them yawned open but dark inside.  
他们绕过停在路边的推车，上面布满了蛛网。还有成堆的箱子，以及未曾动过的带盖气瓶和桶。走廊两旁的房间门大多紧闭，但有些却半开着，里面漆黑一片。

As they walked, Kaworu felt something bristling against the back of his neck again, but this time it was different for he seemed to hear voices, except they were faint and unintelligible. He looked down at the floor; apparently someone was here the last time, with footsteps marked on the dusty linoleum tiles.  
行走间，渚再次感到颈后有东西在刺痛，但这次不同，他似乎听到了声音，尽管模糊且难以理解。他低头看向地面；显然上次有人来过这里，灰尘覆盖的油毡砖上留下了脚印。

"Is there anyone else in here?" Kaworu asked Rei, who shook her head.  
“这里还有其他人吗？”渚薰问绫波，她摇了摇头。

"No," she said. "We are the only ones, I think."  
“没有，”她说。“我想只有我们两个。”

Finally, they arrived at a door that was partly ajar, with no light coming from inside, and which the trails of footsteps have led to here. Rei opened the door and felt for the light switch, flicking it on. The fluorescent lights came alive and Kaworu confronted a scene resembling a hospital room.  
最终，他们来到一扇半开的门前，里面没有灯光，脚印的痕迹也指向这里。绫波打开门，摸索着找到电灯开关，啪的一声打开。荧光灯亮起，渚薰眼前出现了一个类似医院病房的场景。

The room was occupied mostly by a typical hospital bed and carts, and lining the walls were cabinets crammed with bottles and other medical supplies. Larger life-support electronics, still covered in plastic, stood near the bed. A cart with two oxygen tanks was propped against a stack of boxes. On the wall were words painted on in white: _Top, Bottom, Strangeness, Charmed, Up and Down_. As for the bed, the sheets were rumpled and stained with age.  
房间内主要摆放着一张普通的医院病床和几辆推车，墙壁上排列着塞满瓶子和各种医疗用品的柜子。更大的生命维持电子设备，仍覆盖着塑料，立在床边。一辆载有两罐氧气的推车靠在一堆箱子上。墙上有用白色油漆涂写的字样：上、下、奇、魅、上、下。至于床铺，床单皱巴巴的，沾染着岁月的痕迹。

Only then Kaworu heard voices in his mind, but from the past, this time they were coherent and he could recognize the two out of three; he was now hearing through Shinji's ears:  
直到那时，渚薰才在脑海中听到声音，但这次来自过去，它们清晰可辨，他能认出其中两个；他现在正通过真嗣的耳朵聆听：

"_T… This place looks like Ayanami's room," Shinji remarked, sounding astonished._  
“这……这个地方看起来像绫波的房间，”真嗣惊讶地说道。

_"Yes. This is her birthplace," a woman's voice answered. "Light and Water, makes up Rei's unfathomable personality and thus reflects the atmosphere and the very nature of this place."  
“是的。这里是她的出生地，”一个女人的声音回答道，“光与水，构成了丽那难以捉摸的性格，从而也反映了此地的氛围和本质。”_

_Misato cleared her throat, apparently anxious. "Doctor Akagi… Ritsuko, we didn't come here to see this."  
美里清了清喉咙，显然有些紧张。“赤木博士……律子，我们来这里不是为了看这个的。”_

_Ritsuko sighed. "If you wanted the truth, then at least I'm showing who Rei is really is to you," she answered. "Follow me, then."  
律子叹了口气。“如果你想要真相，那么至少我现在向你展示了丽的真实一面，”她回答道，“跟我来吧。”_

Kaworu turned to Rei, who was waiting for him to say. "Is this the place where you were… born?" he asked, his eyes blinking.  
渚薰转向绫波，她正等待着他开口。“这就是你……出生的地方吗？”他问道，眼睛眨了眨。

Rei simply nodded. "That is the truth," she answered. "Three of me have been born here."  
绫波只是点了点头。“那是事实，”她回答。“我已经是第三个在这里诞生的了。”

"Now that explains why… you said that you were the Third," he remarked.  
“现在这解释了为什么……你说你是第三个，”他评论道。

"I am the Third, and I am probably the last."  
"我是第三，也可能是最后一个。"

Kaworu pointed at the painted words. "What do those words mean?" he asked.  
渚薰指着涂鸦的文字。“这些词是什么意思？”他问道。

"They are from quantum mechanics," Rei said. "Doctor Akagi herself wrote them, to explain about my nature."  
"它们来自量子力学，"绫波说。"赤木博士亲自写下它们，用来解释我的本质。"

"Clues about you, maybe," Kaworu said.  
"关于你的线索，或许，" 渚薰说道。

"Yes. Quantum mechanics were all about how subatomic particles behave. A quark is the basic subatomic particle."  
"是的。量子力学都是关于亚原子粒子的行为。夸克是基本的亚原子粒子。"

Kaworu was blinking. "How did you know more of it?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。 "你怎么知道得更多？"

"When I was my second iteration, I studied the meanings of those words on my free time."  
"当我处于第二次迭代时，我利用空闲时间研究了这些词汇的含义。"

"I see. Why do they have to be important?"  
"我明白了。为什么它们必须重要呢？"

"If I am correct, quarks do things that ordinary physics could not explain at all. Quarks can be in _more than one place_ at a time, and quarks could also _defy time or space_."  
"如果我没弄错的话，夸克的行为是普通物理学完全无法解释的。夸克可以同时存在于多个位置，甚至能够超越时间或空间的限制。"

"Is there anything else you wish for me to see?" he suggested.  
"您还有其他希望我看的吗？"他提议道。

"Yes," Rei answered. "We take an elevator further down."  
"是的，"丽回答道。"我们乘电梯再往下走。"

Lying on the cot, Ritsuko felt bored, having read all the books that were given to her to get occupied while behind bars. Instead she was thinking of the bad old days, back when she was in the shadow of her mother. Everyone expected Ritsuko to follow in her mother's footsteps, considering the accolades given for completing Japan's then most powerful supercomputer, the _Orochi_, prior to her masterwork known as the MAGI.  
躺在床上，律子感到无聊，她已经读完了所有提供给她在狱中打发时间的书。相反，她开始回忆那些糟糕的旧时光，那时她生活在母亲的阴影下。每个人都期望律子能追随母亲的脚步，考虑到她当时完成的日本最强大的超级计算机——八岐大蛇，以及后来被誉为杰作的 MAGI 系统。

Ritsuko felt the pressure, the expectations, and she went through all of them with an iron will, graduating with a rare triple degree in computer science, bioengineering and medicine. She succeeded, but at a price as she watched her mother become enamored with Gendo Ikari, and eventually the root cause of the tragedy on the day the MAGI was activated.  
律子感受到了压力和期望，她以钢铁般的意志一一克服，最终以罕见的计算机科学、生物工程和医学三重学位毕业。她成功了，但代价是眼看着母亲对碇源堂情根深种，最终成为激活 MAGI 那天悲剧的根源。

As the only witness, she could remember how the confrontation happened, the exchange of words between her mother and Rei, the strangulation and finally the dry dive down two levels of the Command Center, the late Naoko Akagi hitting the top of Balthazar first, smashing her skull in, before her face caved in once upon landing hard on the floor.  
作为唯一的目击者，她记得那场对峙是如何发生的，母亲和绫之间的言语交锋，窒息，最后是干涸的潜入指挥中心两层，已故的赤城直子首先撞上了巴尔萨泽的顶部，头骨碎裂，然后脸部重重着地，凹陷下去。

Ritsuko managed the lump in her throat, fighting not to retch. In the aftermath she could not bear to see her mother's remains, zipped in a body bag on top of an operating table, but on another table the dead Rei Ayanami was laid there, her mouth agape and the neck completely bruised in purple and blue. She asked herself why, why did her mother had to do this, and she also wondered why Gendo condemned her, and for what crime?  
律子强忍着喉咙里的硬块，努力不让自己呕吐。事后，她无法忍受看到母亲被装在尸袋里放在手术台上，而另一张桌子上躺着死去绫波零，嘴巴大张，脖子完全被紫蓝色的瘀伤覆盖。她问自己，为什么，母亲为什么要这么做，她也想知道碇源堂为何谴责她，又是犯了什么罪？

Apparently Gendo was unsatisfied in manipulating her to obtain knowledge and some sex on the side, his patience with her mother expended that the Rei corpse lying there must have told the truth. After the funeral she wanted to ask, but Gendo did otherwise by begging for help. He was begging on his knees, a strange gesture by a man normally known for his sub-zero personality.  
显然，源堂并不满足于仅通过操纵她来获取知识和偶尔的性关系，他对她母亲的耐心已经耗尽，以至于躺在那里的零号尸体必定说了实话。葬礼后她本想质问，但源堂却跪地乞求帮助。一个以冷酷著称的男人做出这样的举动，实在令人费解。

Ritsuko sighed, figuring that Kaji was right in saying that the lone mole on her cheek was on the path of her tears; from the day of the funeral she was sucked into being involved with Gendo, not knowing that she would eventually wind up in this cage, after being manipulated, all because she was competing with another "rival" for his attention.  
律子叹了口气，心想加持说得没错，她脸颊上的那颗痣正位于泪水流经的路径；从葬礼那天起，她就被卷入了与源堂的纠葛中，不知道自己最终会落入这个牢笼，一切都是因为她为了争夺他的关注而与另一个“对手”竞争，结果被操纵利用。

Rei. A girl made artificially, a piece of laboratory equipment, a tool, built for a specific purpose in Gendo's mind. It was astonishing that she, Ritsuko, was downgraded to a secondary role, after being fed naked to the hungry eyes of SEELE surrounding her, having lost to a girl who had Gendo's nametag on.  
零。一个人工制造的女孩，实验室的设备，工具，在源堂心中被赋予了特定的用途。令人震惊的是，她，律子，竟然降级为次要角色，在被 SEELE 那些饥渴的目光裸露审视后，败给了一个贴着源堂标签的女孩。

Now Ritsuko wondered what that girl was doing at this very moment.  
此刻，律子不禁好奇那个女孩此时此刻在做什么。

They were descending in an elevator, as Kaworu gazed at the immensity of the dim chamber, which had some hexagonal alcoves carved into the walls, giving it the atmosphere of a catacomb. Down below, he could also see the remnants of the failed Eva prototypes collected in large pits, metal-alloy skulls, ribs and femurs. Overhead was a gantry crane with its hook and steel cables, and the only lights in this chamber were small orange bulbs affixed to the concrete ceiling.  
他们正乘坐电梯下降，真嗣凝视着这个昏暗大厅的广阔空间，墙壁上雕刻着一些六边形的壁龛，营造出一种地下墓穴的氛围。下方，他还能看到收集在大坑中的失败 Eva 原型残骸，金属合金的头骨、肋骨和股骨。头顶上方是一台带有钩子和钢缆的龙门吊，而这个大厅内唯一的灯光是固定在混凝土天花板上的小橙色灯泡。

Once out of the elevator and on the floor, Rei led him down a painted path, across the Eva graveyard for nearly 400 meters, passing an abandoned Isuzu Elf utility truck. Now they faced an armored door large enough for two trucks to pass through.  
电梯门一开，绫波便领着他沿着一条漆过的路径，穿过 Eva 坟场近 400 米，途经一辆废弃的五十铃 Elf 工具车。现在，他们面对着一扇足以让两辆卡车并排通过的装甲大门。

With unspoken agreement, Kaworu let Rei open a small inset door cut out from the larger door, the girl again punching in a password and swiped the card in to unlock it, and slid sideways. Rei nodded to Kaworu to come.  
无需言语，渚薰让绫波打开了一扇从大门上切割出的小门，女孩再次输入密码并用卡片刷卡解锁，然后侧身滑入。绫波向渚薰点头示意他进来。

They entered through the door, and Rei went to a large switchbox beside it and with some strength tried to flip the big switch on. It didn't seem to budge, so Kaworu came up and helped pushed the switch upwards. They could now hear the sudden whine of power being restored, motors spinning, lights being lit, and this time they faced a chamber that Kaworu remembered vividly in his mind.  
他们通过那扇门进入，绫波走向旁边的一个大型开关盒，用力尝试翻动那个大开关。它似乎纹丝不动，于是渚薰上前帮忙，一起将开关向上推。他们随即听到了电力恢复的突然嗡鸣声，马达旋转，灯光亮起，这一次他们面对的房间，渚薰在心中清晰地记得。

"This is the Dummy Plug Plant," Rei said. She looked remorseful.  
“这里是模拟插入系统工厂，”绫波说道。她的表情带着悔意。

"Yes," Kaworu said, as he held her hand and walked towards the main tank in the middle. On the floor was an unusual diagram, a glyph laid over, but overhead was a huge representation of a human brain, hammered out of steel and carbon-fiber, pipes, cables and wires leading into this "brain". This odd sculpture is then connected to the floor by a single column resembling the spinal column, and below this metal spine was the middle tank. Wrapping the entire circumference of the chamber were two lines lit in green, DNA sequences in letters.  
“是的，”渚薰说道，牵着她的手走向中央的主罐。地面上铺着一个不寻常的图案，一个符文覆盖其上，而头顶上方则是一个巨大的钢制和碳纤维制成的人脑模型，管道、电缆和电线通向这个“大脑”。这件奇特的雕塑通过一根类似脊椎的柱子与地面相连，柱子下方则是中央罐。整个房间的周长被两条发光的绿色线条环绕，上面是 DNA 序列的字母。

Rei stood before Kaworu, who was still open-mouthed in wonder, and said, "This is the truth about me."  
零站在渚薰面前，他仍然张口结舌，惊叹不已，她说道：“这就是关于我的真相。”

Now the lights on the outer, larger tank surrounding this circle were ablaze, revealing what was left of the Rei clones, floating in the LCL in tatters, dismembered and still disintegrating. Kaworu was speechless, he saw this in his mind before but this time he was now in this very chamber, with the girl he gave his affection to.  
现在，围绕这个圆圈的外部大罐上的灯光亮起，显露出剩余的零克隆体，它们在 LCL 中漂浮，衣衫褴褛，肢体残缺，仍在逐渐分解。渚薰无言以对，他曾在心中见过这一幕，但这次他身处这个房间，与那位他倾注情感的女孩在一起。

Blinking, Kaworu took a breath to center his mind, trying not to be overwhelmed by the carcasses in the tanks.  
眨了眨眼，渚薰深吸一口气以集中思绪，尽量不被水槽中的尸体所压倒。

"Why?" he asked. “为什么？”他问道。

"The Commander and Doctor Akagi were trying to build the Dummy Plug," she said. "They, as you may have known, intend to use them to control the Eva instead of us Children."  
“司令和赤木博士正在尝试制造 Dummy Plug，”她解释道，“他们，正如你可能知道的，打算用它们来控制 Eva，而不是我们这些孩子。”

"And it failed, am I right?"  
"结果失败了，对吧？"

"She eventually destroyed them, out of her hatred."  
"她最终因为仇恨而毁灭了他们。"

"Who told you?" Kaworu asked as he held on to Rei's shoulders.  
"谁告诉你的？" 渚薰问道，同时紧握着绫波零的肩膀。"

The First Children hung her head low. "The Commander told me."  
第一使徒低垂着头。“司令告诉我的。”

This time Kaworu heard in his mind, of Ritsuko's confessions, speaking before Misato and Shinji, on this very spot. Eventually he was now witnessing it mentally, through their eyes and ears, going back in time:  
这一次，渚薰在心中听到了赤木律子的坦白，就在这个地点，在美里和真嗣面前。最终，他通过他们的眼睛和耳朵，在精神上见证了这一切，仿佛回到了过去：

"_These are dummies, and they're all parts for the Dummy Plug," Ritsuko admitted. "We humans found a god and tried to possess that power, and as a consequence the human race came close to extinction fifteen years ago. The god that they found disappeared, yet they decided to remake this god."_  
“这些都是假人，它们都是用于 Dummy Plug 的部件，”赤木律子承认道。“人类找到了一个神，并试图占有那股力量，结果导致了十五年前人类几乎灭绝的后果。他们找到的神消失了，但他们决定重塑这个神。”

"_And what's this god you're talking about?" Misato asked, her service pistol aimed at Ritsuko's back._  
"你说的这个神是什么？" 美里问道，她的制式手枪瞄准了律子的后背。

_The frustrated scientist sighed in regret. "It's Adam, and they created a humanoid from it in order to be close to godhood… That is Eva, the ones that you see often."  
沮丧的科学家遗憾地叹了口气。"那是亚当，他们用它创造了一个类人形体，以接近神性……那就是你常看到的 Eva。"_

_Shinji blinked, still unable to comprehend the enormity of his involvement in this terrible adventure. "Y… You call it a humanoid?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，仍然无法理解自己在这场可怕冒险中的巨大牵连。"你……你称它为类人形体？"_

"_Yes. The Evas do not intrinsically have souls, but they have human souls embedded in them, and all of them were salvaged," Ritsuko said. "However, the vessel that truly contains a soul is Rei. She's the only one born with a soul, but none of these clones have it. The Chamber of Guf is therefore empty. These…" she swept her hand around, "These things that look like Rei have no souls. They're just empty vessels, shells, puppets, tools... dolls."_  
"是的。Eva 本身并不具备灵魂，但它们被植入了人类的灵魂，所有这些灵魂都是被抢救出来的，"律子说道。"然而，真正拥有灵魂的容器是零。她是唯一一个天生拥有灵魂的，但这些克隆体都没有。因此，古夫之室是空的。这些……"她挥手环顾四周，"这些看似零的东西没有灵魂。它们只是空壳，傀儡，工具……玩偶。"

_From the pocket of her lab coat, Ritsuko suddenly whipped out what looked like a PDA. Her face also darkened with odium, teeth clenched in fury.  
律子突然从她的实验服口袋里掏出一个看起来像 PDA 的东西。她的脸色也因憎恶而阴沉，愤怒地咬紧牙关。_

"_Now… I'm going to fucking destroy them, I'm sick and I hate them all!" she raged._  
"现在……我要彻底摧毁它们，我受够了，我恨它们全部！"她怒吼道。"

"_NO!" Misato and Shinji yelled in unison, but it was too late as Ritsuko pressed the "Kill" button on the PDA's display, transmitting the death sentence through wireless network, to the tank environment control computer in the chamber, and the Rei imitations began to disintegrate, their destrudo released against their will... if they had a will, which they truly don't possess. Blood, flesh and organs soon intermingled with the LCL in the tank, turning it into a soupy abattoir of the macabre._  
"不！" 美里和真嗣齐声喊道，但为时已晚，律子按下了 PDA 显示屏上的“处决”按钮，通过无线网络将死刑命令传输到房间内的坦克环境控制计算机，那些丽复制体开始解体，它们的破坏欲被迫释放……如果它们有意愿的话，但实际上它们并不具备。血液、肉体和器官很快与 LCL 混合在一起，使坦克变成了一个恐怖的肉汤屠宰场。

_Ritsuko dropped the PDA to the floor, and went down on her knees, weeping. Misato had the pistol drawn closer to her. Witnessing the resulting gore in the outer tank caused Shinji to go white, bend down and retch, his most recent meal dumped on the floor.  
律子将 PDA 丢到地上，跪了下来，哭泣着。美里手中的枪握得更紧了。目睹外层坦克中的惨状，真嗣脸色苍白，弯下腰呕吐起来，他最近的一餐全吐在了地板上。_

"_What's wrong with you?" Misato yelled, still shaken. "Do you know what you're doing?"_  
“你疯了吗？”美里仍然震惊地喊道，“你知道自己在做什么吗？”

"_Yes..." Ritsuko murmured. "I know what I'm doing. Destroying, that is. They're not human, but just imitations of life!"_  
"是的..." 律子喃喃道。"我知道我在做什么。毁灭，也就是说。它们不是人类，只是生命的仿制品！"

_Shinji was coughing loudly, gasping for air, unable to intervene as he listened.  
真嗣大声咳嗽着，喘不过气来，听着这一切却无法插手。_

"_You're wrong!" Misato countered. "In my eyes, Rei is still a HUMAN BEING to me, yet you still think she's not just because she screwed up your life or because she's expendable? As her commanding officer, she has become a part of me and my concern, and her being a clone or whatever you're blabbering about isn't an issue anymore!"_  
"你错了！" 美里反驳道。"在我眼里，丽对我来说仍然是一个人，而你却认为她不是，仅仅因为她毁了你的生活或因为她可以被牺牲？作为她的指挥官，她已经成为我的一部分，成为我的关切，她是不是克隆人或你胡言乱语的那些东西，已经不再重要了！"

"_I LOST AGAINST THE DAMNED THING!" Ritsuko shot back, still sobbing. "When I think of him–Ikari–I can live though any insult. I didn't give a shit about myself... But he did. I knew that."_  
"我居然输给了那该死的东西！" 律子回敬道，依旧抽泣着。"每当我想起他——碇——我就能忍受任何侮辱。我不在乎自己……但他关心。我知道这一点。"

_Misato cringed, breathing shallowly, watching her friend regressing into a remorseful kindergartener, punishing herself. Shinji tried to stand up straight, but he propped his hands upon knees as he shook.  
美里皱眉，呼吸浅促，看着她的朋友退化成一个懊悔的幼儿园孩子，自我惩罚。真嗣试图站直，但他双手撑在膝盖上，颤抖着。_

"_I'm really stupid..." Ritsuko bemoaned. "I'm so fucking stupid as my mother! Misato... I was made a goddamned fool and played around with!"_  
"我真的好蠢……" 律子哀叹道。"我真是蠢得跟我的母亲一样！美里……我成了一个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，被人玩弄于股掌之间！"

_Raising her head, tears flying away, the defeated scientist noticed the pistol and screamed, "Shoot me then! Just shoot me! I don't care anymore! I'm useless! I'm a monster!" Ritsuko then curled up to her knees to a prone fetal position and wailed wordlessly.  
她抬起头，泪水飞溅，这位战败的科学家注意到了手枪，尖叫道：“那就开枪吧！开枪打死我！我再也不在乎了！我毫无用处！我是怪物！”随后，律子蜷缩成一团，跪在地上，无声地痛哭。_

_But Misato shook her head, as she lowered her gun down and switched the safety back. "No, I can't," she disagreed, sobriety returned to her voice. "You'll look real dumb if you wanted to die."  
但美里摇了摇头，她放下枪，重新打开了保险。“不，我不能，”她反驳道，声音恢复了清醒。“如果你想死，那看起来真的很愚蠢。”_

Kaworu drew himself back to the present, blinking his eyes twice to recover from the ordeal of someone else's yesterday, yet his hands were still on Rei's shoulders.  
薰回到现实，眨了两次眼，从别人的昨日中恢复过来，但他的手仍搭在绫波的肩上。

"I don't care if you're manufactured or something," Kaworu said. "You're still Rei to me. One and the same, alive and breathing. You still have an identity, even if they say otherwise."  
"我不在乎你是否是人造的，"渚薰说。"你对我来说依然是绫波。一样的存在，有生命，会呼吸。你依然有自己的身份，即使别人不这么认为。"

Rei nodded, before silence settled between the couple, as Kaworu pondered at the consequences leading to this horrifying sight right before them. With one hand he caressed her cheek gently.  
绫波点点头，随后两人间陷入了沉默，渚薰思索着导致眼前这可怕景象的种种后果。他一只手轻轻抚摸着她的脸颊。

"Ayanami… I think it's time for me to confess," Kaworu said.  
"绫波…我想是时候向你坦白了，"渚薰说。"

"You may speak," Rei answered. "I am willing to listen to your truth."  
"你可以开口，" 丽回答道。"我愿意倾听你的真相。"

Kaworu lowered his head in commiseration, as if to tell her the words he was about to say may not be of comfort to Rei, before he spoke.  
薰低下头表示同情，仿佛在告诉丽他即将说出的话可能不会给她带来安慰，然后他开口了。

"There is something hidden inside you, as you are a vessel for another soul. You cannot see _her_, but sometimes you feel her. The Commander has never told you about this, so I have to tell you instead."  
"你体内隐藏着某种东西，因为你是一个容纳另一个灵魂的容器。你看不见她，但有时你能感觉到她。司令从未向你透露过这一点，所以我必须代为告知。"

Kaworu brushed his messed-up hair with a free hand, and sighed. "You and I have taken the same form as the Lilim, and we've been here long before you and I have taken those forms, before you were able to acquire an identity different from her, and even before they walked upon this planet."  
渚薰用空着的手梳理了一下凌乱的头发，叹了口气。“你我以莉莉姆的形态存在，早在你我采取这种形态之前，早在你获得与她不同的身份之前，甚至早在他们踏上这片星球之前，我们就已经在这里了。”

Rei said nothing, listening as he spoke.  
绫波零没有说话，静静地听着他讲述。

"Eventually the Lilim accidentally discovered what we are, and so they made us into their own image, to contain souls, but we were made differently by two different Lilim, with completely different perspectives, one each with their own agendas, their purpose and goals."  
“最终，莉莉姆无意中发现了我们的存在，于是他们按照自己的形象创造了我们，用来容纳灵魂，但我们是由两位持有完全不同观点的莉莉姆以不同的方式创造的，各自怀有不同的目的和目标。”

Kaworu now stared into Rei's eyes, cerise upon cerise.  
渚薰此刻凝视着绫波的眼睛，深红对深红。

"You and I are keys belonging to them, and they want to use us in order to be the first to win the race in deciding the future of the Lilim... and of the Angels, and possibly of this universe."  
“你我都是属于他们的钥匙，他们想利用我们，以便在这场决定人类……以及使徒，甚至是这个宇宙未来的竞赛中拔得头筹。”

Rei blinked. "And you are indeed an…?"  
绫波眨了眨眼。“那你确实是个……？”

"_Angel_," Kaworu answered, with a tinge of regret in his voice. "Forgive me, Rei, for lying to you, for the deception I made from the start… I am _Tabris_, the Angel of Free Will. I am the last of my kind, and the only one left to take the Lilim's form, to accept the final sacrifice."  
"天使," 渚薰回答道，声音中带着一丝遗憾。"原谅我，丽，我对你撒了谎，从一开始就是欺骗……我是塔布里斯，自由意志的天使。我是我族中的最后一个，也是唯一一个以人类形态存在，接受最终牺牲的。"

The Fifth Children took a deep breath, closed his eyes and concentrated, willing himself to levitate until he was a meter off the ground. Once he was floating in the air, Kaworu opened his eyes, his arms stretched downwards.  
第五适格者深吸了一口气，闭上眼睛集中精神，努力让自己悬浮起来，直到离地面一米高。一旦他飘浮在空中，渚薰睁开眼睛，双臂向下伸展。

"This is the truth about me, the answer to all your questions," Kaworu admitted. "You are also one half of what I am seeking for ages, the lost half which our creators have mourned about. And in case should you want to know what is your true nature is, who is hidden beneath your heart… You have Lilith's soul, just as I possess Adam's soul."  
"这就是关于我的真相，所有问题的答案，" 渚薰坦白道。"你也是我多年来一直在寻找的另一半，那被我们的创造者哀悼的失落的一半。如果你想知道你的真实本质是什么，隐藏在你内心深处的是谁……你拥有莉莉丝的灵魂，正如我拥有亚当的灵魂。"

Rei was astonished, her eyes wide-open in shock.  
绫波感到震惊，她的眼睛因惊讶而睁得大大的。

"Though you are dormant and unformed, in some ways you are the _same_ as I am, Rei Ayanami," he concluded with regret. "Heart, mind, yet completely different souls, two for each of us, one each for ourselves… and I am very sorry to tell you this truth, which I think is hurting you… yet I don't want to hurt you, either."  
“尽管你沉睡且未成形，在某些方面你与我相同，绫波零，”他带着遗憾总结道，“心灵，思想，却又是完全不同的灵魂，我们各自拥有两个，而自己只有一个……我很抱歉告诉你这个真相，我想这让你痛苦……但我也不想伤害你。”

But the First Children went down on her knees, apparently in intense pain.  
但初号机少女跪倒在地，显然承受着剧烈的痛苦。

"N… No," she gasped.

---

In mid-meal, with no discussion of the ambush incident whatsoever on the table, Misato's cellphone went off instead, interrupting them all. Shinji, Asuka and Tsutomo suddenly went about fumbling pockets for their phones.  
用餐中途，关于伏击事件的讨论丝毫未提，米萨托的手机却突然响起，打断了所有人。真嗣、明日香和筒本立刻开始在口袋里摸索自己的手机。

"That's mine," Misato said, as she stood up. "Excuse me, guys, it's in my room," the woman added, walking into her bedroom and picked up the phone.  
“那是我的。”米萨托说着站起身来。“抱歉，各位，在我房间里，”她补充道，走进卧室并拿起了电话。

"This is Katsuragi, who's this?" she asked without hesitating to check the caller ID.  
“我是葛城，哪位？”她毫不犹豫地接起电话，没有查看来电显示。

"It's me, Makoto," the man at the other end said.  
"是我，真琴，" 电话那头的人说道。

Misato sighed in relief. "Oh, it's you. All right, tell me what's up?"  
美里松了口气。"哦，是你。好吧，告诉我怎么了？"

"Interrogation's underway on those three terrorists, although it's taking too long," he reported. "Damage control is being worked on, and maybe you should be interested in this… Kaworu's with Rei, and they came up asking me where you guys were, and I told them you were home."  
"对那三个恐怖分子的审讯正在进行中，不过进展太慢了，"他报告道。"损害控制工作正在进行，也许你会对此感兴趣……薰和绫波在一起，他们来找我问你们在哪里，我告诉他们你们在家。"

"So… what's the big deal with those two?"  
"那么…那两个人有什么大不了的？"

"They looked worried, but they said they wanted to hang out at the pool below instead. Except that I noticed that they were actually—get this—_holding hands_."  
"他们看起来很担心，但他们说想在下面的泳池边玩。不过我注意到他们实际上——你敢信——在牵手。"

Misato shook her head. "Oh, I see. He just wanted to spend some time with her, and he already told me about it during lunch, just before we left."  
美里摇了摇头。"哦，我明白了。他只是想和她共度时光，而且他已经在午饭时告诉我了，就在我们离开之前。"

"That made sense... sounds more like they're dating. Well, what else do you need?"  
"那说得通...听起来更像他们在约会。那么，你还需要什么？"

"Tell Doctor Odani that I'll be coming down later, and that includes you in the discussion."  
"告诉小谷医生我稍后会过去，你也一起参与讨论。"

Makoto sounded surprised. "Me?"  
真琴听起来很惊讶。"我？"

"Yeah, I think she's also up to something, in the same way you do because by now she's probably done with the DNA analysis on Kaworu's blood sample. The pieces seem to be falling into place."  
“是啊，我觉得她也在搞什么名堂，就像你一样，因为她现在可能已经完成了对渚薰血液样本的 DNA 分析。一切似乎都在逐渐明朗。”

"Right," Makoto agreed, "and you know what? Throughout today Commander Ikari was absent, and only now he's back at work. We wondered what the heck he was doing while gone as we had trouble in our own backyard."  
“没错，”真嗣赞同道，“你知道吗？今天一整天碇司令都不在，直到现在才回来工作。我们都在想他到底去干嘛了，毕竟我们自己这边也一团糟。”

Misato groaned. "Looks like he's shut himself out of the world for a while. Some guys on the top literally lock the door to let off steam, but with that guy's case, I think he's up to something else besides taking a rest."  
美里叹了口气。“看来他是把自己封闭起来了。有些高层人士会关上门来释放压力，但就他而言，我觉得他不仅仅是休息那么简单。”

"I see. Well, I have to get going right now. See you later," Makoto said.  
"我明白了。嗯，我现在得走了。回头见，" 真琴说。

"Yeah, later, Lieutenant. Bye," Misato concluded before ending the call. She then went back to the dining table, when Asuka queried, "Who was that?"  
"好的，回头见，副队长。再见，" 美里结束了通话。随后她回到餐桌旁，这时明日香问道："那是谁？"

"Lieutenant Hyuga," Misato answered. "Just some important business I have to deal with after this. The attack, that is."  
"是副队长日向，" 美里回答。"只是一些我在这之后必须处理的重要事务。关于那次攻击的事。"

"Ah. Did he mention anything about Ayanami and Kaworu?" Shinji asked after he bit into his portion of teriyaki.  
"啊。他提到绫波和薰了吗？" 真嗣咬了一口他的照烧肉后问道。

"He said they just wanted to take a dip at the pool."  
"他说他们只是想去泳池泡泡水。"

Suddenly Asuka was laughing. "I was right! Good God, I was right!" she exclaimed. "He's trying to do his Edward Cullen imitation!"  
突然，明日香笑了起来。"我猜对了！天哪，我猜对了！"她喊道。"他在模仿爱德华·卡伦！"

Misato had a quick sweat-drop on her forehead. "What?"  
美里额头上迅速冒出一滴冷汗。“什么？”

"You know," Asuka said, gesticulating with her hands as she clarified. "Edward Cullen. _Twilight._ Edward meets Bella Swan, that is, and then _bam!_ He falls in love with her."  
“你知道，”明日香一边用手势强调，一边解释道，“爱德华·库伦。《暮光之城》。爱德华遇见贝拉·斯旺，然后砰！他就爱上了她。”

Misato and Shinji nodded.  
美里和真嗣点点头。

"Ah… The movie, huh?" the Third Children concurred.  
"啊…电影，是吧？" 第三适格者们一致同意道。

"Sorry if I forgot a bit about that and the book," Misato admitted.  
"如果我忘了那件事和书的内容，抱歉，" 美里承认道。

"Yeah," Asuka said. "I was thinking about it some hours ago while getting my medical records done with, because you and I noticed he's been close to Rei. I don't know whether it's romantic or something between them, but it's surprising because I think he's trying to _thaw her out_."  
"是啊，" 明日香说。"几个小时前我在整理医疗记录时就想到了，因为你和我注意到他最近和绫波走得很近。我不确定他们之间是不是有什么浪漫关系，但这挺让人惊讶的，因为我觉得他好像在试图融化她。"

Unexpectedly Tsutomo guffawed but Shinji quietly shook his head in jest. Rei was indeed famous as an unemotional girl, hence the secret nickname of "Ice Princess" within the NERV grapevine.  
出乎意料地，Tsutomo 放声大笑，而 Shinji 则打趣地轻轻摇头。Rei 确实以无情感的女孩著称，因此在 NERV 内部流传着一个秘密绰号——“冰公主”。

But to Misato the odd comparison between that fictional character and Kaworu caused the hairs on the back of her neck stand up, for she watched _Twilight_ on the DVD player with Asuka and Ritsuko three months ago. She could even now remember one of the memorable lines from the film:  
但对 Misato 来说，那个虚构角色与 Kaworu 之间的奇怪对比让她后颈的汗毛竖起，因为她三个月前和 Asuka 及 Ritsuko 一起在 DVD 播放器上观看过《暮光之城》。她甚至现在还能记得电影中的一句难忘台词：

"_What if I'm not the hero? What if I am… the bad guy?"_  
“如果我不是英雄呢？如果我是……那个坏人呢？”

Misato shivered, for Kaworu Nagisa was an unknown quantity, and so did Edward Cullen. Mentally she paraphrased that line, and suddenly she felt like being sucker-punched:  
Misato 颤抖着，因为 Kaworu Nagisa 是个未知数，Edward Cullen 也是如此。她在心里改述了那句话，突然感觉像是被猛击了一拳：

_What if Kaworu is the_ bad guy?  
如果 Kaworu 是坏人呢？

"Misato? What's wrong?" Shinji asked, waving his hand over her eyes.  
“Misato？怎么了？” Shinji 问道，用手在她眼前挥了挥。

The woman blinked her eyes twice, her thoughts disrupted.  
女人眨了眨眼，思绪被打断。

"You were pale in the face. I wondered why you looked startled." he added.  
“你脸色苍白。我好奇你为何显得惊慌。”他补充道。

"Oh. I'm sorry, I thought of something," Misato said, feeling apologetic. "Come on, looks like your teriyaki's the best I ever tasted, Shinji," she praised, changing the subject on the dinner table.  
“哦，抱歉，我想到了些事情。”美里带着歉意说，“来吧，看来你的照烧鸡是我尝过最美味的，真嗣。”她夸赞道，顺势改变了餐桌上的话题。

Gendo was waiting at his desk when Fuyutsuki arrived, sated from dining alone down at the Cafeteria. As usual the Commander was in his standard thinking position, and he looked slightly irritable.  
当冬月到达时，源渡正坐在他的办公桌前，独自在食堂用餐后显得心满意足。一如既往，指挥官保持着他那标准的思考姿势，看起来略显烦躁。

"You summoned me?" Fuyutsuki asked, standing still before his one-time student.  
“您召见我？”冬月问道，静静地站在他昔日的学生面前。

Gendo gave out the wordless murmur. The old professor took it as a "yes".  
源渡发出了一声无言的低吟。老教授将其理解为“是”。

"I know," Fuyutsuki said. "You're probably wondering about that terrorist attack and the weapons shipment."  
"我知道，" 冬月说。"你可能在想那次恐怖袭击和武器运输的事。"

"Why did you approve the black budget for the weapons?" Gendo asked outright, coherent this time.  
"你为什么要批准武器的黑预算？" 碇源堂直截了当地问，这次思路清晰。"

Fuyutsuki scowled. "Do you think we could be at ease once all this is over? I feel it's not going to end peacefully. Furthermore, do you think that the Committee would always bow before you? Can we get away with this?"  
冬月皱眉。"你以为这一切结束后我们能安然无恙吗？我觉得不会和平收场。再者，你以为委员会会永远对你俯首称臣吗？我们能逃脱这一切吗？"

"They are only deluding themselves in waiting for their wish, and they have too much to expect from us," Gendo answered, apparently dodging the question.  
"他们只是在自欺欺人地等待愿望成真，并且对我们寄予了太多期望，" 碇源堂回答，显然在回避这个问题。

"I don't know, but you and I know that their influence and their anxiety remain enormous. Now if they find out that we're deviating further from what they originally insisted on, it would be easy for them to penalize us. In what form? Don't simply expect them to send in a debt collector or a lawyer knocking on our door. We're balancing on a strand of hair right now."  
"我不知道，但你我都知道他们的影响力和焦虑感依然巨大。现在如果他们发现我们偏离了他们最初坚持的方向，他们很容易就会惩罚我们。会以什么形式？别指望他们会派个讨债的或律师来敲我们的门。我们现在正走在钢丝上。"

"What do you mean?" Gendo asked. He couldn't believe that Fuyutsuki somehow had some added confidence he never heard from him before. Normally the old man was contented to remain in the background, present only when Gendo asked him for an opinion.  
"你是什么意思？" 碇源堂问道。他无法相信冬月 somehow had some added confidence he never heard from him before. Normally the old man was contented to remain in the background, present only when Gendo asked him for an opinion.

"If they can play the UN like a harp, it's a matter of time that they might as well drop a bomb on us before we could prepare ourselves. That's what the black defense budget is for."  
“他们能把联合国玩弄于股掌之间，迟早也会在我们毫无防备时投下炸弹。这就是黑色国防预算的用途。”

The Commander only managed an exasperated grumble. Like Hamamoto, Fuyutsuki could be right.  
指挥官只能无奈地咕哝了一声。像 Hamamoto 一样，Fuyutsuki 可能是对的。

---

Rei covered her face in grief, sobbing as she finally knew the truth about Kaworu. But the Fifth Children went down on his knees and embraced her, whispering for forgiveness.  
绫波因悲伤掩面而泣，终于得知了关于渚薰的真相。但第五适格者跪下拥抱着她，低声请求原谅。

"Rei… I apologize, forgive me for what I said," Kaworu mumbled into her ear.  
"丽…我道歉，原谅我刚才说的话，" 渚薰在她耳边低语。

"But why you have to be here?" Rei pleaded. "Why?"  
"但为什么你非得在这里？" 丽恳求道。"为什么？"

Kaworu frowned. "I… I have nothing much except to fulfill a sacred oath, an oath I took before the Committee, to do what they wanted. The Complementation of Man and Human Instrumentality, as they named their policies, must be accomplished."  
渚薰皱眉。"我…我除了履行一个神圣的誓言，一个我在委员会面前立下的誓言，做他们希望的事情之外，别无他法。他们称之为人类补完计划的政策，必须完成。

The young man sighed for a breath. "You see, it's a very long story. I was made in the same way you do, but I was raised differently. They taught me everything about this world, but once I went out to fulfill their wishes, and then I met you, everything changed. Suddenly I had a different thought about the Lilim…  
"年轻人叹了口气。“你看，这是个很长的故事。我像你一样被制造出来，但我被养育的方式不同。他们教会了我这个世界的所有知识，但当我走出去实现他们的愿望时，我遇见了你，一切都变了。突然间，我对莉莉姆有了不同的看法……”

"You mean…" Rei gasped, not sure what else to say, but Kaworu began wiping the tears away from her cheeks.  
“你是说……” 丽惊呼，不知该说些什么，但渚薰开始为她拭去脸颊上的泪水。

Kaworu took a breath. "At first, I thought that the hopes of the Lilim are to be in tears and suffering, written down in sorrow. They get angry, flustered, desperate, and even consumed over other Lilim, but after a few days being here, I have changed my mind about what the Lilim are all about. I finally understood through the sufferings and lamentations of others, and why they're always the pain in their hearts."  
渚薰深吸了一口气。“起初，我认为莉莉姆的希望在于泪水和苦难，被悲伤所记载。他们愤怒、慌乱、绝望，甚至因其他莉莉姆而陷入疯狂，但在这里度过的几天后，我对莉莉姆的看法改变了。我终于通过他人的苦难和哀叹理解了，以及他们为何总是心怀痛苦。”

Kaworu looked into Rei's eyes.  
渚薰凝视着绫波的眼睛。

"Though I have learned much, in about three days my time here would be over, as the elders demand it. They expected to see what they wanted to see. My inevitable death, as the Scrolls insisted on. But I did the best I could to turn everything around and revitalize the hopes of those closest to me, including yours, before it's too late."  
"尽管我已学到了许多，大约三天后，我在这里的时间就会结束，这是长老们的要求。他们期待看到他们想看到的。正如卷轴所坚持的那样，我不可避免的死亡。但我尽我所能去扭转一切，并在为时已晚之前重燃那些最亲近我的人，包括你的希望。"

"But what about you?" she asked, genuinely concerned.  
"但你呢？" 她问道，真心关切。

Kaworu scowled, feeling doubtful for the first time. "I'm not sure, except maybe for what would be the inevitable."  
渚薰皱起眉头，第一次感到怀疑。“我不确定，除了那不可避免的。”

Slowly Rei embraced Kaworu. "I… I do not want to lose you," she whispered. "Please."  
慢慢地，绫波零拥抱了渚薰。“我……我不想失去你，”她低声说。“请不要离开。”

"I have no choice, Ayanami… I can't escape my destiny. It's going to happen, it can't be avoided altogether as they have already set everything in motion."  
“我没有选择，绫波……我无法逃避我的命运。它即将发生，无法完全避免，因为他们已经启动了一切。”

For a minute or so they were silent, both seated on the floor.  
大约一分钟的时间里，他们沉默着，两人都坐在地板上。

"Why is it that you gave us hope… yet you do not seem to have hope of your own?" Rei asked, breaking the stillness in the chamber.  
“为什么你给了我们希望……而你自己却似乎没有希望？”丽问道，打破了室内的寂静。

The question somehow caught Kaworu unawares, but he answered, "I am supposed to fight on behalf of the Angels, their hope to win their rightful reward, to live forever at the cost of human annihilation... But depending on how things would play out, I am probably destined to die. To be or not to be, but it doesn't matter at all. Death is the only release for me."  
这个问题不知怎的让渚薰措手不及，但他回答道：“我本应代表使徒们战斗，他们的希望是赢得应有的回报，以人类灭绝为代价永生……但根据事态的发展，我大概注定要死去。存在与否，其实都无关紧要。死亡是我唯一的解脱。”

Tears from Kaworu's eyes spattered on Rei's shoulder.  
渚薰的眼泪洒落在绫波的肩上。

"Don't be angry at me, but in the end… Shinji will be my executioner once I tell him he would have to save humanity at my expense, or face the consequences if he loses."  
“别生我的气，但最终……当我告诉他必须牺牲我来拯救人类，否则将面临后果时，真嗣会成为我的处决者。”

"Ikari…?"

"Yes. He, in my heart, would be the rightful key to salvation, even if he may soon face tribulation than anything else witnessed in history. The life that escapes being destroyed and obtains the future will be the one left standing, and the Lilim, if they could ever redeem themselves, would stand to gain hope more than I do."  
“是的。在我心中，他将是拯救的正当钥匙，即使他将面临比历史上任何事物都更严峻的考验。那些未被毁灭并获得未来的人将屹立不倒，而人类，如果能自我救赎，将比我获得更多的希望。”

Rei stared at Kaworu right into his eyes and asked, "If you are condemned… Is there any other way you could think of _changing things_?"  
丽盯着渚薰的眼睛，问道：“如果你被判有罪……你还能想到其他改变现状的方法吗？”

"I don't know… Yet…" Kaworu trailed, but immediately Rei's suggestion made sense. He blinked. "Wait a minute. You mean, _changing_ my destiny?"  
“我不知道……还没有……”渚薰迟疑地说，但随即丽的话让他恍然大悟。他眨了眨眼。“等等。你是说，改变我的命运？”

"Yes," Rei answered. “是的，”丽回答道。

"How?"

"The future is always uncertain and since it is that way, one could change the future…"  
"未来总是充满不确定性，正因为如此，人们可以改变未来……"

"…By altering the present," Kaworu added, the idea dawning upon him.  
"……通过改变现在，" 渚薰补充道，这个想法在他心中逐渐清晰。"

"Nagisa, I do not want to lose you," Rei said. "I want you and I to live. I do not want my relations to be lost. That is why only you and Ikari could also change all our destinies. You do not need to die unnecessarily."  
"渚，我不想失去你，" 绫波说。"我希望你我能活下去。我不希望我们的关系消失。这就是为什么只有你和碇能改变我们所有人的命运。你不必无谓地死去。"

"I'm not sure," Kaworu doubted. "But I'll try. Sometimes prophecies, I think, could be broken."  
"我不确定，" 渚薰怀疑地说，"但我会尝试。有时候，我觉得预言是可以被打破的。"

Both Children rose from the glyph-spangled floor, relieved from the emotional ordeal of their revelations. He helped Rei get up onto her feet, pulling her hand with his.  
两个孩子从布满符文的地板上站起身来，从情感的磨难中解脱出来。他帮助绫波站起来，拉着她的手。

"Would you forgive me this time?" Kaworu asked. He wiped his cheeks with the back of his hand.  
"这次你能原谅我吗？" 渚薰问道。他用手背擦了擦脸颊。

Rei nodded. "That would be acceptable."  
丽点点头。"那样可以接受。"

"And… are you hungry, too? Looks like we're past dinnertime."  
"还有……你也饿了吗？看起来我们错过了晚饭时间。"

"Yes."

---

"There's one more thing I forgot to mention," Gendo said to Fuyutsuki. He was in the same thinking position for the last hour. "It's about the Second Children. Why she's still here, not departing, considering the attempt on her life?"  
"还有一件事我忘了提，"源渡对冬月说。他保持同一个思考姿势已经一个小时了。"关于第二适格者。为什么她还留在这里，没有离开，考虑到有人试图取她性命？"

Fuyutsuki sighed, arms crossed over his chest. "Miss Langley's staying in. She asked me if I could give her another chance to be a pilot once more, and yes, I approved her request and reinstated her to active duty. That is my command responsibility, and as your second-in-command, I have the same authority as you are when it comes to dealing with Eva pilots."  
冬月叹了口气，双臂交叉在胸前。“兰利小姐留下来了。她问我是否能再给她一次机会重新成为驾驶员，是的，我批准了她的请求，恢复了她的现役身份。这是我的指挥职责，作为你的副指挥，在处理 EVA 驾驶员的问题上，我拥有与你相同的权力。”

Gendo blinked, and he suddenly rose from his seat. "Why did you do that?" he demanded.  
碇源堂眨了眨眼，突然从座位上站了起来。“你为什么要这么做？”他质问道。

"She told me her reasons," Fuyutsuki countered, yet unperturbed by Gendo's astonishment. "Miss Langley intends to reinvent, to correct herself for all of her mistakes and to be the pilot of Unit Two again."  
“她告诉了我她的理由，”冬月反驳道，尽管对碇源堂的惊讶不为所动。“兰利小姐打算重塑自我，纠正她所有的错误，并再次成为二号机的驾驶员。”

"Why?" Gendo asked. “为什么？”源堂问道。

"Because the professor in me says so, and the students who usually fail under my class often beg me to give them a chance to try again, to make the grade in the next semester, and I don't want to begrudge Miss Langley a second chance. Besides, do you remember the day when I bailed you out of jail?"  
“因为作为教授的我这么认为，而且那些在我课上通常不及格的学生常常恳求我给他们一次重试的机会，在下个学期争取及格，我不想剥夺兰格利小姐第二次机会。此外，你还记得我把你从监狱里保释出来的那天吗？”

At the mere mention of the past, Commander Ikari was suddenly quiet.  
仅仅提到过去，碇司令突然沉默了。

"That was the day I gave you a chance to prove yourself," Fuyutsuki recalled, "because you were then looking for me and you also have influence, after I was appointed by the university's regent on the spot as your adviser. I never forget the day of our first meeting."  
"那是我给你机会证明自己的一天，" 冬月回忆道，"因为你当时在找我，而且你也有影响力，我在大学摄政的现场被任命为你的导师。我永远不会忘记我们第一次见面的那天。"

Scowling, Gendo settled down on his seat, pondering with that piece of his past.  
皱着眉头，源渡坐回自己的座位，沉思着那段过去。

"Now if you have any doubts about my loyalty," Fuyutsuki said, as if he was able to read Gendo's mind. "I'm not usurping your position, nor am I starting a mutiny. I'm trying to set things right as a reasonable man in a position of great, yet painful, responsibility."  
"现在如果你对我忠诚有任何疑虑，" 冬月说道，仿佛能读懂源渡的心思，"我并非要篡夺你的位置，也不是在发动叛乱。我作为一个有理智的人，在承担着巨大而痛苦的责任的位置上，试图把事情理顺。"

"You may leave," Gendo said, keeping his anger in total control. "Get yourself a rest, as you've been too busy all day."  
"你可以离开了，" 碇源堂说道，完全控制住了自己的怒气。"去休息一下吧，你今天忙了一整天。"

"Yes," Fuyutsuki said, before he pivoted and walked away.  
"是，" 冬月回答道，随后转身离开。

Once the ex-professor closed the door behind him, Gendo took off his glasses and cleaned them with the hem of his jacket. He couldn't believe that tonight Fuyutsuki dared to be so frank and almost overstepped his authority, yet like Hamamoto earlier he cannot deny that his second-in-command was also right. After all, Gendo was the one who invited him into this venture almost a long time ago, to squelch his vehement opposition and because Yui put them together in an effort to continue her legacy.  
当这位前教授关上身后的门后，碇源堂摘下眼镜，用夹克的下摆擦拭着。他无法相信今晚冬月竟敢如此直言不讳，几乎逾越了他的权威，但就像早先的 Hamamoto 一样，他也不能否认他的副手也是对的。毕竟，碇源堂是那个几乎很久以前邀请他加入这项事业的人，以平息他强烈的反对，并且因为唯的努力让他们走到了一起，以继续她的遗志。

As he put on his glasses again, he suddenly remembered Rei Ayanami.  
当他再次戴上眼镜时，突然想起了绫波零。

Shinji and Asuka leaned on the veranda railing, sated after their first dinner together since coming out of coma, breathing in the cold December air and gazing at the moonlit night sky, its reflection on the lagoon can be seen shimmering from here. He looked thoughtful, as if the prospect of an optimistic future with Asuka was forthcoming, and he, like the girl beside him, also overcame the initial guilt of shooting in self-defense. Already, Misato went out, heading back to Headquarters on an urgent job, while Tsutomo had to be content with watching a car drifting battle on TV and at the same time exchanging text messages with someone on his phone.  
真嗣和明日香靠在阳台栏杆上，自从苏醒后第一次共进晚餐，他们心满意足，呼吸着寒冷的十二月空气，凝视着月光下的夜空，从这里可以看到泻湖上的倒影闪烁着。他看起来若有所思，仿佛与明日香共同展望一个乐观的未来即将到来，而他，就像身边的女孩一样，也克服了最初因自卫而开枪的愧疚。此时，美里已经外出，急忙赶回总部处理紧急任务，而堤人则只能满足于在电视上观看一场汽车漂移比赛，同时用手机与某人互发短信。

"I wonder what they would be thinking about us if we ever return to school," Shinji said.  
“不知道如果我们回到学校，他们会怎么想我们。”真嗣说道。

"We'll knock them out," Asuka answered before she chuckled. "We'll tell them that we're together from now on, that we're putting all those ridiculous rumors to rest."  
"我们会把他们打倒的，" 明日香回答后轻声笑了起来。"我们要告诉他们，从今往后我们在一起，让那些荒谬的谣言都烟消云散。"

"Yeah," he agreed.

"I was wondering if I could make Unit Two work again for me. Rei said that I have to open my heart. How that would be?" she asked.  
"我在想我是否能让二号机再次为我所用。绫波说，我必须敞开心扉。那样做会如何呢？" 她问道。"

Shinji turned to Asuka. "Try to make peace with her," he suggested.  
真嗣转向明日香。"试着与她和解，" 他建议道。

"I know. It's just that I have to prove myself and Unit Two that I'm a different Asuka now."  
"我知道。只是我必须向自己和二号机证明，现在的我是不同的明日香。"

"And how would you say once you're onboard?"  
"那你上船后会怎么说呢？"

Asuka sighed, not feeling sure, trying to think about it until she answered. "I don't know… No, maybe I'd just say I wanted to be forgiven."  
明日香叹了口气，心中不确定，思索着回答道：“我不知道……不，也许我会说我希望得到原谅。”

"For what?"

"For insulting her shortly before that Angel in the sky hit my head and turned me into a nutcase," she admitted, before closing her eyes, thinking back on that rainy afternoon of her downfall.  
“在那天使从天而降砸我脑袋把我变成疯子之前，我确实侮辱了她，”她承认道，随后闭上眼睛，回想起那个让她坠落的雨天下午。

"_You're just my doll, so move like I tell you to, and don't say NO anytime! Why a weapon does have to carry a conscience or a mind? What crap coming from that Wondergirl! Anyway, you must only say 'Yes' on everything I do! Hear me?"_  
“你只是我的玩偶，所以按我说的去做，任何时候都不要说‘不’！为什么武器必须有良心或思想？那个神奇女孩说的都是什么废话！总之，你必须对我的所有行为都说‘是’！听到了吗？”

Asuka pursed her lips. "I have to talk right this time," she said. "If I could remember correctly… If one pisses off a horse while riding, once provoked that steed will throw an idiot rider off his back, so in a sense, horses have feelings and it's the same with Eva."  
明日香抿了抿嘴唇。“这次我必须说得对，”她说，“如果我没记错的话……如果在骑马时激怒了马，一旦被惹恼，那匹马就会把愚蠢的骑手甩下去，从某种意义上说，马是有感情的，就像 Eva 一样。”

"You maybe right," Shinji agreed.  
"你可能是对的," 真嗣同意道。

Misato and Makoto entered Natsumi's lab and they greeted each other. After they all sat down around a study table with a notebook computer on top, the young doctor started to explain to them her discovery.  
美里和诚进入了夏美的实验室，他们互相打招呼。所有人都围坐在一张放有笔记本电脑的桌子旁，年轻的医生开始向他们解释她的发现。

"Well," she began, "having persuaded the BOQ-bachelor officer's quarters-manager to borrow her keys on the pretext of inspecting the rooms for sanitary compliance, I managed to get into Nagisa's quarters while he's out, and I took a few samples of his hair on a comb he had on the desk. The next thing I did was to process the hair strands, put them through the analyzer and after about thirty minutes, I have these results."  
"那么，"她开始说道，"我以检查房间卫生合规性为由，说服了 BOQ（单身军官宿舍）的管理员借给我钥匙，趁渚外出时进入了他的房间，并从他桌上的梳子上取了几根头发样本。接下来，我将这些头发样本进行处理，放入分析仪中，大约三十分钟后，我得到了这些结果。"

Natsumi double-clicked on a report file and the computer loaded it up.  
夏美双击了一个报告文件，电脑随即加载了它。

"With the analyzed DNA, I went about matching his sequence with several others in the database, and—you wouldn't believe this but…"  
“通过分析的 DNA，我开始将他的序列与数据库中的几个其他序列进行匹配，而且——你不会相信这个但是……”

Misato and Makoto blinked in unison, completely astonished after reading the match results. "He's an _Angel?_" they mumbled.  
美里和诚同时眨了眨眼，完全被匹配结果震惊了。“他是使徒？”他们喃喃自语。

"I'm afraid so," Natsumi admitted. "The results are clear as day. Scared the hell out of me the first time I saw it. His DNA matched positive with several other Angel DNA samples, but the rest of his sequence are human. _Homo sapiens._ And then, just being curious, I also compared his DNA with that of Ayanami—they also _matched_ in most parts."  
"恐怕是的，" 夏美承认道。"结果一目了然。第一次看到时简直吓得魂飞魄散。他的 DNA 与多个使徒 DNA 样本匹配呈阳性，但其余序列都是人类的。智人。然后，出于好奇，我还把他和绫波的 DNA 进行了比对——他们大部分也匹配。"

Misato felt deathly quiet for a moment before she spoke again. "Now that Nagisa is definitely the Seventeenth Angel, do you know what the implications of our discovery would have for us tomorrow if this were to go public?"  
美里感到一阵死寂，片刻后才再次开口。"既然渚确实是第十七使徒，你知道如果这个发现公开，对我们明天的影响会有多大吗？"

Natsumi nodded. "Yes, I'm very aware that it could be disastrous. Total chaos."  
夏美点头。"是的，我很清楚这可能会带来灾难性的后果。彻底的混乱。"

"Good Christ… One plus one equals two," Misato murmured, as an odd thought struck her. "Zero no longer becomes a lonely number." She also touched her crucifix as if she was asking for emotional support.  
“天哪…一加一等于二，”美里喃喃自语，一个奇怪的念头突然闪过她的脑海。“零不再是一个孤独的数字。”她还触摸着她的十字架，仿佛在寻求情感上的支持。

In Japanese, _Rei_ also meant _Zero_ or nil or nothingness_._  
在日语中，Rei 也意味着零、虚无或空无。

"I beg your pardon?" Natsumi asked.  
“你说什么？”夏美问道。

Misato cleared her throat. "I think Kaworu Nagisa now has a full-blown relationship with Rei Ayanami at this very moment," she decided. "I also think they're even in _love_."  
美里清了清嗓子。“我认为渚薰现在和绫波丽已经完全发展成了一段关系，”她断定道，“而且我觉得他们甚至可能相爱了。”

"What?"

Misato explained about Kaworu's developing affair with Rei, and the revelation that dawned upon her while Asuka talked of comparing Kaworu with Edward Cullen at the dinner table, drawing a conclusion in which Kaworu maybe a bad guy, considering that he came from the Committee. They replayed and reviewed the inquest videos made earlier today, and finally she mentioned about the unusual sync rates, and Makoto corroborated this with the data he illegally obtained from Maya's computer earlier this week.  
美里解释了渚薰与绫波之间逐渐升温的恋情，以及她在晚餐桌上听阿斯卡伦将渚薰与爱德华·卡伦相比较时所领悟到的真相，她得出了一个结论：考虑到渚薰来自委员会，他可能是个坏人。他们重播并审查了今天早些时候制作的审讯视频，最后她提到了异常的同步率，真嗣则用他本周早些时候从玛雅电脑上非法获取的数据来证实这一点。

"Now that he's a real Angel, a sentient Trojan Horse, how could we deal with him?" Makoto asked, now looking anxious.  
“既然他现在是一个真正的天使，一个有意识的特洛伊木马，我们该如何对付他？”真嗣问道，神情显得焦虑不安。

"I'm not sure, but we have to keep this a secret between us," Misato said, pausing to sigh. "I'll deal with him once I see that boy first in the morning, so mark my words. Gonna have to do this quietly or this place would soon be in an uproar. Worse, if he finds out, the Commander may have that boy's head on a silver tray before we could try to get him… if it's remotely _possible_ to make an Angel reconsider his plans."  
"我不确定，但我们必须对此保密，"美里说道，停顿了一下叹了口气。"我会在早上第一眼看到那孩子时处理他，记住我的话。必须悄悄进行，否则这里很快就会闹得沸沸扬扬。更糟的是，如果他发现了，司令可能会在我们试图救他之前就把那孩子的头放在银盘上……如果有可能让使徒重新考虑他的计划的话。"

Misato turned her attention to Natsumi. "Save those files and give me a copy on flash memory before you nuke them off from your hard drive," she ordered. "We can't allow them to fall into the Commander's hands. We'll present all of this evidence to Fuyutsuki once he's available."  
美里转向夏美。"保存那些文件，并在你从硬盘上删除它们之前给我一个闪存盘的副本，"她命令道。"我们不能让它们落入司令手中。一旦他空闲下来，我们会把这些证据全部提交给冬月。"

Natsumi nodded. "Sure, this one's going to be a hot potato now… and oh, by the way, where's Tsutomo?"  
夏美点点头。"当然，这个现在成了烫手山芋……哦，对了，津友在哪里？"

"He's with the Children, doing his babysitting thing for now."  
"他现在和孩子们在一起，忙着他的保姆工作。"

Natsumi made a sour face. "Shit," she cursed. "With this damned yellow alert, looks like I'll have to scuttle our date for tomorrow. I'm sure he's also upset, too."  
夏美皱起了眉头。“该死，”她咒骂道，“这该死的黄色警报，看来明天的约会得取消了。我敢肯定他也很不爽。”

Alone in his office, Gendo Ikari was typing a few query commands on his computer, telling the search algorithm to comb through surveillance videos in the past 12 hours since he went down to Terminal Dogma for his reflection. He was wondering about Rei's whereabouts after she left the Infirmary with a clean bill of health, and without his full knowledge.  
独自一人在办公室里，碇源堂正在电脑上输入几个查询命令，指示搜索算法梳理过去 12 小时的监控视频，自从他下到最终教条区进行反思以来。他想知道绫波零离开医务室并获得健康证明后去了哪里，而且没有他的全面了解。

The facial-recognition algorithm would match every frame of video with a supplied scan of someone's face, and then he executed the command for the MAGI to process.  
面部识别算法会将视频的每一帧与提供的面部扫描进行匹配，随后他执行了命令，让 MAGI 进行处理。

Several floors below, the MAGI went to action at blazing speed as it used the search algorithm to flip through frames of immense, high-definition video files stored in the surveillance video server, until it spat out the search results with several matching video clips back to Gendo.  
在楼下几层，MAGI 以惊人的速度行动起来，利用搜索算法翻阅存储在监控视频服务器中的庞大高清视频文件帧，直到它吐出搜索结果，将几个匹配的视频片段反馈给碇源堂。

He gazed at the results, and he wasn't pleased, the man clenching his jaw, figuring as to why Rei was with Kaworu Nagisa around six o'clock this evening at Gate 18. What were they doing out there, and where they came from? Worse, why they were holding hands?  
他凝视着结果，并不满意，男人紧咬牙关，思索着为什么绫波零今晚六点会在 18 号门前与渚薰在一起。他们在那里做什么，又是从哪里来的？更糟糕的是，他们为什么手牵手？

Gendo fumed. _This discrepancy isn't part of the plan,_ he told himself_._  
源渡怒火中烧。这种偏差不在计划之内，他自言自语道。

In the bedroom, where she planned to sleep with Shinji later, and with her laptop connected to the Internet, Asuka opened the browser and entered her mother's full name into Google, and then the search engine brought out several links, including one from a university where her mother once used to work at. Clicking on the link, Asuka went to the website's staff list of past scientists and researchers, and found her old picture.  
在卧室里，她计划稍后与真嗣一起睡觉，同时她的笔记本电脑连接着互联网，明日香打开浏览器，输入了她母亲的完整姓名到谷歌中，搜索引擎随即显示出几个链接，包括她母亲曾经工作过的一所大学的链接。点击链接后，明日香进入了网站过去科学家和研究人员的员工名单页面，并找到了她母亲的老照片。

Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu was there in a formal portrait, then wearing a lab coat, her shoulder-length brown hair formed into a bun, smiling at the camera. It was her, back in good times before she surrendered a part of herself to Unit-02.  
京子·齐柏林·惣流的照片中，她身着实验服，肩上的棕色短发盘成一个发髻，对着镜头微笑。那是她，在将一部分自己交给二号机之前的美好时光。

Asuka then immediately printed the picture out from a connected inkjet printer in high resolution on photo paper, and grabbed a pair of scissors to cut away the excess paper. She then went out, found a red short candle and its glass holder, a small _bunchin_ paperweight and a box of matches on a table, and walked outside to the veranda.  
随后，明日香立即从连接的喷墨打印机中以高分辨率在相纸上打印出图片，并拿起一把剪刀剪去多余的纸张。接着，她走出房间，在桌子上找到了一支红色短蜡烛及其玻璃烛台、一个小纸镇和一盒火柴，然后走到外面的阳台上。

"What are you doing?" Shinji asked, his TV watching interrupted as he stood up, leaving Tsutomo at the couch.  
“你在做什么？”真嗣问道，他的电视观看被打断了，他站起身来，留下坐在沙发上的筒本。

Asuka turned to Shinji and said, "Gotta make amends."  
明日香转向真嗣，说道：“得去弥补一下。”

Shinji noticed the picture. "Uh… That's your mom?"  
真嗣注意到了那张照片。“呃…那是你妈妈吗？”

The girl nodded. "Yes," she answered while propping the picture against a flower pot with the paperweight to hold it in place, and lit the candle in front, cupping her one hand to protect the flame from the wind.  
女孩点点头。“是的，”她一边回答，一边用镇纸将照片固定在花盆前，点燃了蜡烛，一只手护住火焰以防被风吹灭。

Once done, Asuka stood back and sighed, staring at the impromptu shrine she set up.  
完成后，明日香退后一步，叹了口气，凝视着自己临时搭建的小祭坛。

"She really looks like you," Shinji remarked with a soft smile after he observed her for a minute.  
“她真的和你很像，”真嗣观察了她一会儿后，温柔地笑着说。

Asuka smiled back. "Thanks. Never thought of it until now."  
明日香微笑回应。“谢谢。我之前从没这么想过。”

Silently Asuka closed her eyes and clasped her hands together. Although she was born a Lutheran, never in many years of her being a self-proclaimed atheist had she thought of praying and of paying attention to her faith, so tonight for the first time she made up a prayer of her own, this time for personal atonement for all of her sins.  
明日香默默地闭上眼睛，双手合十。尽管她出生在一个路德宗教家庭，多年来她自称无神论者，从未想过祈祷或关注自己的信仰，但今晚，她第一次为自己编了一个祈祷，为了个人的赎罪，为所有的罪孽。

_Mama, please forgive me, as I wanted to forgive you.  
妈妈，请原谅我，因为我曾想原谅你。_

---

While he watched Asuka pray, Shinji saw a brief bright line in the sky, a shooting star quickly fading over Hakone's peaks. He wondered if it was a sign, and he smiled, hoping it was a good omen.  
当他看着明日香祈祷时，真嗣在天空中看到了一道短暂而明亮的光线，一颗流星迅速在箱根的山峰上消逝。他不知道这是否是一个征兆，于是微笑着，希望这是一个好兆头。

**Author's Notes:** This is what we get for that "Show me yours and I'll show you mine" saw.  
作者笔记：这就是我们所说的“你给我看你的，我就给你看我的”那句话的结果。

I'll be honest with myself: this chapter has got to be the toughest act for me to follow, as the characterization here sometimes comes so threateningly close to OOCness, and it's very damned emotional. With the pacing I use, I'm hazarding the possibility of completing about 30 chapters or even more, including EOE portions which are in planning, so right now we're at the midpoint.  
我得对自己坦白：这个chapter对我来说绝对是最难接手的作品，因为这里的角色刻画有时离出戏太近，而且情感上非常激烈。按照我的节奏，我可能会完成大约 30 章甚至更多，包括正在规划的 EOE 部分，所以现在我们正处于中间点。

Although "Lilin" is the _correct_ spelling as mentioned in the Death and Rebirth information pack, I retained the mistranslated word "Lilim" (originally an error on the part of ADV) because for some reason I don't think I want to go over and redo everything; "Lilin" or "Lilim", they mean the same, so I have no regrets in this decision.  
虽然“Lilin”是根据《死与新生》资料包中提到的正确拼写，但我保留了误译的“Lilim”（最初是 ADV 的错误），因为出于某种原因，我不想重新修改所有内容；“Lilin”或“Lilim”，它们意思相同，所以我对这个决定没有遗憾。

OBTW, "Second Section" or "Section Two" refers to a part of the Intelligence Division, also known as the Department of Security Intelligence.  
顺便一提，“第二部分”或“第二节”指的是情报部门的一部分，也称为安全情报局。

As for fanfic writing, it becomes an enjoyable hobby only when you have been grounded in the requisites of writing, spelling and grammar, reading, research, brainstorming, finding the right storyline you wanted to use, and of course, being creative with ideas. To quote a Somali novelist named Nuruddin Farah: _"Good writing is like a bomb: it explodes in the face of the reader."_  
至于同人文写作，只有当你掌握了写作、拼写和语法、阅读、研究、头脑风暴、找到你想要使用的正确故事线，当然还有创意构思等基本要素时，它才会成为一种愉快的爱好。引用索马里小说家努鲁丁·法拉赫的话：“好的写作就像一颗炸弹：它在读者面前爆炸。”

This one's for Alnilam and her hubby, to Karina, DennisSud, NPH, NegativeZero, and Kenshiro aka Pookie.  
这是献给 Alnilam 和她的丈夫，以及 Karina、DennisSud、NPH、NegativeZero 和 Kenshiro（又名 Pookie）的。

Gendo Ikari was now on the go, alone, even in this late hour of the evening, roaming the near-empty hallways of the entire complex. Every time he passed yet another khaki-clad employee in his path, he or she gets out of his way as if to acknowledge his absolute authority, and simultaneously fear his presence.  
碇源堂此刻正独自行动，即便已是深夜，他仍徘徊在几乎空无一人的整个建筑的走廊上。每当他经过另一个身着卡其色制服的员工时，他们都会迅速让开，仿佛在承认他的绝对权威，同时畏惧他的存在。

Tonight, he was looking for Rei Ayanami, one of his most valued possessions worth about quarter of a billion US dollars in development expenses, wondering where she and Kaworu Nagisa went to after they were last seen at level B-20. But they were easily identifiable; it was a simple matter of querying the surveillance videos or asking the Section Two suits or security personnel patrolling about.  
今晚，他在寻找绫波零，这个他最珍贵的资产，其开发费用高达约二十五亿美元。他好奇她和渚薰最后出现在 B-20 层后去了哪里。但找到他们并不难；只需查看监控录像或询问第二部门的官员或巡逻的安全人员即可。

His main concern was that she was out of his control for too long, that he feared that her so-called "purity" could be under threat of being compromised by "excessive" human contact. Gendo must step in and take her back, discipline her if possible even though she had the brain of a 35-year-old woman, and tell Kaworu Nagisa to back off for a while.  
他最担心的是她脱离他的掌控太久，他害怕她所谓的“纯洁”可能会受到“过度”人类接触的威胁。碇源堂必须介入，将她带回，如有可能甚至要对她进行管教，尽管她拥有一个 35 岁女人的心智，并告诉渚薰暂时退后。

The Commander grumbled at one particular thought: he was like an anxious parent of an unruly teenager staying out too long at night.  
指挥官对某个特定的想法咕哝着：他就像一个焦虑的父母，担心一个不听话的青少年深夜不归。

They were back in the secluded garden, this time eating their bento box dinners they bought at the commissary. As they ate on the lawn, Kaworu noticed Rei's slightly morose facial expression.  
他们再次回到了那个隐蔽的花园，这次是在享用从食堂买来的便当盒晚餐。当他们在草地上用餐时，渚薰注意到了绫波零略显忧郁的表情。

"Are you still upset?" he asked out of concern.  
“你还在难过吗？”他关切地问道。

Rei shook her head. "N... No," she stammered, but corrected herself. "Yes, for I have underestimated you. I feel guilty… Yet it makes sense that the truth can hurt."  
丽摇了摇头。“不……不，”她结巴着，但随即纠正自己。“是的，因为我低估了你。我感到内疚……然而真相能伤人，这是有道理的。”

"Yes," Kaworu agreed. "Throughout the whole time, I was thinking hard about whether I need to tell it or not. But since you were obviously waiting for me to answer your doubts, I had no choice except to do what must be done."  
“是的，”渚薰同意道。“一直以来，我都在深思是否需要告诉你。但既然你显然在等待我解答你的疑虑，我别无选择，只能做必须做的事。”

The Fifth Children put down his bento box, and reclined.  
第五适格者放下他的便当盒，向后靠去。

"There's a problem, though," Kaworu said. "We can't tell this to Shinji or to Misato; it's almost like the same way they discovered your secret. As far as they're concerned, they'll not take the truth about me very lightly. Shinji has this fragility that could be broken, and I'm still very much worried about him, even though I told him to be firm."  
"不过，有个问题，"渚薰说。"我们不能告诉真嗣或美里；这几乎就像他们发现你秘密的方式一样。在他们看来，他们不会轻易接受关于我的真相。真嗣有这种脆弱，可能会被打破，尽管我告诉他要坚强，但我仍然非常担心他。"

Kaworu shook his head. "If Misato were to know my secret, I'm sure she'll be real angry."  
渚薰摇了摇头。"如果美里知道了我的秘密，我敢肯定她会非常生气。"

"Why?" Rei asked. “为什么？”绫波问道。

"In her heart, after she lost someone she loved, she still has a dilemma: on one hand her father caused her great pain, yet on the other she has devoted herself to duty, out of revenge, to stop my predecessors from succeeding. I'm afraid I'm not ready yet to confront her if she ever finds out."  
"在她心中，失去了所爱之人后，她仍有一个矛盾：一方面她的父亲给她带来了巨大的痛苦，另一方面她为了复仇，投身于职责，阻止我的前辈们成功。我担心如果她发现了，我还没有准备好面对她。"

"Maybe I could help you," Rei said. "Maybe with me we could explain. You cannot do this alone."  
“也许我能帮你，”丽说。“有我在，我们或许能解释清楚。你不能独自完成这件事。”

"Perhaps to make them think twice?"  
“或许是为了让他们三思？”

Rei nodded. "Yes, that is correct."  
丽点点头。“是的，没错。”

Kaworu hesitated for a moment, before he picked up his empty bento box, beckoned Rei to hand over her box and slid them into a plastic bag. Then they stood up, with Kaworu pulling Rei up, and he said, "I guess it's getting too late, so I'll walk with you on the way home and drop you there."  
渚薰犹豫了一下，然后拿起自己的空便当盒，示意绫波递过她的盒子，将它们一起滑入塑料袋。随后他们站起身，渚薰拉着绫波起来，说道：“我想时间不早了，我陪你走回家，送你到门口吧。”

---

With her explosive secrets about Kaworu securely pocketed in her uniform, Misato was heading to her car parked at the linear train station when she found Kozo Fuyutsuki waiting for her besides the woman's Renault Alpine. He was carrying a briefcase, alone and he looked tired.  
美里将关于渚薰的爆炸性秘密牢牢藏在制服口袋里，正朝停在磁悬浮列车站的自己的车走去，却发现副司令葛城文在雷诺 Alpine 旁等着她。他独自一人，提着公文包，看起来很疲惫。

"You're going home, sir?" she asked.  
“您要回家了吗，副司令？”她问道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Yes, I'm supposed to," he said before sighing. "However, I think we should motor out first down to my favorite spot."  
冬月点了点头。“是的，我应该这么做，”他叹了口气说，“不过，我想我们先开船去我最喜欢的地方吧。”

Misato blinked. "Why, and where, sir?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“为什么，去哪儿，长官？”

The older man smiled. "Down at the levy, near my home. From Kaji's stories about you, I know you have a penchant for drink, so I think I would like to have a tipple and some talk. I really needed to get a nasty problem off my chest."  
年长的男人笑了笑。“在我家附近的堤坝那儿。从加持跟你讲的故事里，我知道你喜欢喝酒，所以我想喝点小酒聊聊。我确实需要把一个烦心事说出来。”

"I didn't know you could still drink," Misato said. "I also thought of talking with you, sir. I have something important to discuss."  
"我不知道你还能喝酒，"美里说。"我也想过和你谈谈，指挥官。我有件重要的事要讨论。"

"Good," Fuyutsuki said. "I also hope that at my age… God, it's been a very long time… I might still be able to hold my alcohol. Well, shall we?"  
"好啊，"冬月说。"我也希望在我这个年纪……天啊，真是好久没喝了……或许我还能保持酒量。那么，我们开始吧？"

Misato grinned as she opened the Renault's door. "Okay, sir. Be my guest."  
美里笑着打开了雷诺的车门。"好的，指挥官。请进。"

"I'll take that as a compliment, Major."  
"我会把这当作一种赞美，少校。"

---

Having accompanied her all the way to the girl's home, despite walking in the darkness away from the Geofront, Kaworu was standing by the door to her flat while Rei swung it open.  
尽管在远离地表的黑暗中行走，碇真嗣一直陪她到了女孩的家门口，而渚薰则站在她公寓的门前，看着绫波零打开门。

"Would you like to come in?" she asked. "Tea again, perhaps?"  
"你想进来吗？"她问道。"再来杯茶，如何？"

The Fifth Children shook his head. "N… No, I'm afraid I'll have to go back quickly."  
第五适格者摇了摇头。“不……不，恐怕我得赶紧回去。”

Rei looked disappointed. "Why?"  
绫波看起来有些失望。“为什么？”

In his mind, he thought he saw the glint coming from the Commander's glasses, hence he explained, "I have a feeling that the Commander must be looking for you; perhaps he's too worried. If he asks, just tell him you're alone."  
在他心中，他觉得自己看到了指挥官眼镜上的反光，因此解释道：“我感觉指挥官一定在找你；也许他太担心了。如果他问起，就告诉他你一个人在这里。”

The First Children thought of this: if he lingered too long, their secret could be compromised.  
初代孩子们这样想：如果他逗留太久，他们的秘密可能会暴露。

"I'm sorry," Kaworu said.  
“对不起，”渚薰说。

"It is all right, Nagisa. I will deal with him," Rei said.  
“没关系，渚。我会处理他的，”绫波说。

"Guess I'll see you tomorrow, then, Ayanami," Kaworu answered before he leaned close enough to kiss her on the lips, and this lasted for almost half a minute before they disengaged and stared at each other.  
"那明天见吧，绫波。" 渚回答道，随即倾身靠近，轻轻吻上她的唇，这一吻持续了近半分钟，两人才缓缓分开，彼此凝视。

"Thank you," Kaworu said, nodding, before Rei watched him sprint away and make a turn for the stairwell adjacent to the elevator, and only then she closed the door.  
"谢谢你。" 渚点头致谢，随后绫波看着他疾步离去，转向电梯旁的楼梯间，直到那时她才关上了门。

She sighed, but nervously hoping that the Commander wouldn't catch up with him.  
她叹了口气，心中忐忑不安，希望司令官不会追上他。

Upon rolling off the car train, they drove south on Route 75, passing through two NERV security checkpoints without incident, until they reached Moto-Hakone on the southern shore of Lake Ashinoko. In the village proper, Misato stopped by a local Lawson's convenience store, probably the only one open for 24 hours on the busier Route 1, bought a Yebisu six-pack and a big bag of spiced pork rinds.  
从汽车列车上滚落下来后，他们沿着 75 号公路向南行驶，顺利通过了两个 NERV 安全检查站，直到抵达芦之湖南岸的箱根町。在村子里，美里在一家当地的罗森便利店前停下，这可能是 1 号公路上唯一一家 24 小时营业的便利店，她买了一提惠比寿啤酒和一大袋香辣猪肉脯。

Misato then drove a few hundred meters up to the famed levee, which gave visitors a magnificent night scene, with the full moon shimmering on the lake's surface. With Fuyutsuki guiding her, Misato parked the Alpine under an oak tree, got off and brought out the beer and pork rinds on the hood as a impromptu table, with an old newspaper underneath to keep from scratching the blue paint job.  
随后，美里驱车几百米来到著名的堤坝上，这里为游客提供了壮观的夜景，满月在湖面上闪烁着光芒。在冬月副司令的指引下，美里将阿尔派车停在一棵橡树下，下车后将啤酒和猪肉脯摆在引擎盖上作为临时餐桌，下面垫了一张旧报纸以防刮伤蓝色的车漆。

They pulled the tabs off and made the first drink, as Fuyutsuki sighed at the beauty of the countryside at night. He could see afar the faint sodium lamps at the edges of what was left of Tokyo-3, and the dark silhouette of the mountains beyond it. The waves splashed against the levee wall, flying droplets glistening with the moonlight, as the old man could also espy to the right the lone _torii_ arch just off the lakeshore.  
他们撕开拉环，调制了第一杯饮品，而冬月则对着夜晚乡间的美景叹息。他远远望见东京-3 残存边缘的昏暗钠灯，以及其背后山脉的暗影。波浪拍打着堤坝墙，飞溅的水珠在月光下闪烁，老者还能瞥见右侧湖岸边孤零零的鸟居。

"Never thought this place can even be so beautiful tonight," Fuyutsuki commented, holding his can.  
“从未想过今晚这里竟能如此美丽，”冬月评论道，手中握着易拉罐。

"Yes, sir," Misato agreed.  
“是的，先生，”美里附和道。

"It's been a hectic day, and we're full of it. You're fortunate to be able to survive this far."  
"今天真是忙得不可开交，我们都被折腾得够呛。你能撑到现在，算是走运了。"

Misato nodded, and then took a swig of the brew. "Almost eight hours ago, Asuka decided to stay in, and before that, we dodged bullets intended for her and lived to tell about it," she said. "Although Kanzaki explained to me that the convoy was a diversionary tactic, we wound up getting more than we could bargain for."  
美里点点头，然后喝了一口饮料。“差不多八小时前，明日香决定留在家里，而在那之前，我们躲过了针对她的子弹，还活了下来，”她说道，“虽然神崎解释说那支车队只是个幌子，但我们最终还是遭遇了超出预期的麻烦。”

"Why would someone want to kill her?"  
"为什么会有人想杀她呢？"

"I have no idea, sir," Misato answered, sounding disappointed. "No, really, some people out there who have a reason to hate us. I have a list of suspects behind all that, but they sounded far-fetched."  
"我不知道，长官，"美里回答道，听起来有些失望。"不，真的，有些人有理由恨我们。我有一份嫌疑名单，但听起来都太牵强了。"

"They're still looking into such leads, as we all know," Fuyutsuki said, referring to Director Hamamoto and Section Two. "Personally, I was wondering if those terrorists wanted her dead to favor their cause. If so, it would've been a propaganda boon, but why they would go to great lengths to mount such a risky attack?"  
"正如我们所知，他们仍在追查这些线索，"冬月说道，指的是滨本主任和第二课。"我个人在想，那些恐怖分子是否想让她死来支持他们的事业。如果是这样，这将是一次宣传上的胜利，但他们为什么要大费周章地进行如此冒险的攻击呢？"

"That's the mystery," Misato said, shrugging. "Sometimes terrorist groups would do free-lance work on someone's behalf for a decent fee, I believe, to scare off people or wreck any government."  
"这就是谜团所在，"美里耸耸肩说。"有时候恐怖组织会为了可观的报酬，代表某人进行自由职业的工作，我相信，目的是为了吓唬人或破坏任何政府。"

"I see," Fuyutsuki said, but he thought of Kaworu Nagisa.  
"我明白了，" 冬月说，但他想起了渚薰。

"There's another thing I would like to ask. Tell me, is it a coincidence that Nagisa is here?"  
"还有一件事我想问。告诉我，渚在这里是巧合吗？"

"I don't know, sir," Misato answered while picking up a pork rind and munched it. "But now that we're talking about him, there's the good and the bad: good because he seemed to be acting as some sort of a guidance counselor for them, turned their fortunes around."  
"我不清楚，先生，" 美里回答着，同时拿起一片猪皮嚼了起来。"但既然我们提到了他，有好的也有坏的：好的一面是他似乎充当了某种辅导员的角色，改变了他们的命运。"

The woman sighed. "Still, even if he's so much of a blessing for us in the last four days, I still can't shake my doubts about him, so we decided to look a little closer, try to find out what he's made of. That's the bad, by the way."  
女人叹了口气。“尽管过去四天他给我们带来了如此多的福祉，我仍无法消除对他的疑虑，所以我们决定再深入调查，试图弄清楚他的底细。顺便说一句，这就是问题所在。”

Fuyutsuki frowned. "Any proof?"

"This time I have the evidence with me," Misato said, as she went back into the car and pulled out a notebook computer. She booted it up and as soon as the operating system was loaded, she inserted the SD card and opened the files that Natsumi copied to her, showing them to Fuyutsuki.  
“这次我有证据在手，”美里说着，回到车里拿出了一台笔记本电脑。她启动电脑，操作系统一载入，便插入 SD 卡，打开夏美复制给她的文件，向冬月展示。

The old man was astonished afterwards. "Where did you obtain all of this?" he asked.  
老人随后大为震惊。“你从哪里弄到这些的？”他问道。

"Had to do much of the sleuthing in secret," Misato answered, setting the computer aside. "His odd sync rates and the way he fiddles the core, his piloting abilities, his DNA structure, and the fact that he's prime Committee property means that we need to be careful when approaching him, but we'll never know when he'll make the first strike. However, if all of this information comes to the Commander's knowledge, he'll probably bag Nagisa and exploit him or even simply kill the boy."  
"不得不在暗中进行大量侦查工作，"美里回答，将电脑推到一旁。"他异常的同步率、操纵核心的方式、驾驶技能、DNA 结构，以及他是委员会的重要资产这一事实，意味着我们在接近他时必须谨慎，但我们永远不知道他何时会先发制人。然而，如果这些信息传到指挥官耳中，他很可能会控制渚并利用他，甚至直接除掉这个男孩。"

"So how could we deal with him now that he's a potential threat?"  
"那么，既然他现在是一个潜在威胁，我们该如何应对呢？"

"I need to move in closely and discreetly," Misato said. "Since he's probably the best shot of them all, I'm not sure if it'll work but I'll try talking him out of invading Terminal Dogma, tell him it's not worth trying for. Otherwise I may have to liquidate him myself as a last resort before he makes the final move to contact Adam."  
"我需要悄悄地接近他，"美里说。"既然他可能是他们中最出色的射手，我不确定这样做是否有效，但我会尝试说服他放弃入侵终端教条，告诉他那不值得一试。否则，在他最终行动与亚当接触之前，我可能不得不亲自作为最后的手段解决他。"

"Now, what if we succeeded, even if it's a dog's chance in hell, turning him to _our_ side?" Fuyutsuki asked, guessing the tantalizing opportunities from Kaworu's remotely possible defection.  
“那么，即使机会渺茫如地狱中的狗，如果我们成功将他拉拢到我们这边呢？”冬月问道，猜测着从渚薰可能的背叛中诱人的机遇。

The woman smiled faintly. "That would have been very amazing, with many possibilities. I could probably get more information from him about what's the Committee is really up to. Heck, if he were to become our trump card we could also turn the tables on them. Right now all I have are bits and pieces."  
女人微微一笑。“那将会非常惊人，充满各种可能性。我或许能从他那里获得更多关于委员会真正意图的信息。见鬼，如果他能成为我们的王牌，我们甚至可以扭转局势。现在我只有零星的片段。”

Fuyutsuki shook his head. "Unbelievable," he muttered before he chugged down his beer. "Do anything it takes before he breaks into Terminal Dogma, while maintaining minimal collateral damage. Regardless of what Commander Ikari insists on, you have my authorization, carte blanche and non-paper. I'll deal with him myself, and we'll keep this to ourselves."  
冬月摇了摇头。“难以置信，”他喃喃自语，随即大口喝下啤酒。“在他闯入最终教条之前，不惜一切代价，同时尽量减少附带损害。无论碇司令坚持什么，我授权你全权处理，不记名文件和非正式文件。我会亲自处理他，这件事我们自己知道就好。”

"I'll try, and we're ready," she replied. "However, there might be some difficulty ahead."  
"我会试试，我们已经准备好了，"她回答道。"不过，前方可能会有一些困难。"

"What?"

"I think he's also in love, sir," she remarked.  
"我想他也是爱上了某人，先生，"她评论道。

The old man was surprised. "With whom? Ayanami?"  
老人感到惊讶。"和谁？绫波吗？"

Misato nodded. "Ever since he arrived, he became much closer to her, and more so after the failed compatibility test. Just before we left and got nearly wasted down the road, he told me he wanted to go out with her. They're not really telling me much about their relationship, but by my woman's intuition now they're probably on first base."  
美里点点头。"自从他来了以后，他和她的关系就变得亲密多了，尤其是在兼容性测试失败之后。就在我们离开差点在路上出事之前，他告诉我他想和她约会。他们没怎么跟我透露他们的关系，但凭我的直觉，他们现在可能已经到了第一垒。"

Fuyutsuki chuckled. "I wonder if Ikari would be able to accept that, but they'll have to be careful as their affair isn't a part of his plan. All his bets are riding upon her."  
副司令笑了笑。"我在想碇司令能否接受这一点，但他们必须小心，因为这段恋情并不在他的计划之中。他所有的赌注都押在她身上。"

Misato shrugged. "Whatever it is, their relationship could very well affect everything we do. Good or bad, I don't know except to wait and see unless I get to him, face to face."  
美里耸耸肩。"不管怎样，他们的关系很可能会影响我们所做的一切。是好是坏，我不知道，只能等着看，除非我能面对面地找他谈谈。"

"Again, let us try turning him around and see what happens," Fuyutsuki said. "In his human form, I hope he actually has a _conscience_ better than the others."  
"再次，让我们试着把他转过来，看看会发生什么，" 冬月说。"在他的人类形态下，我希望他的良知比其他人更好。"

"I hope so, even if it's a long shot," Misato agreed.  
"我也希望如此，尽管这希望渺茫，" 美里同意道。"

Suddenly Fuyutsuki held an upraised finger at her. "And, oh, I forgot one more thing…"  
突然，冬月向她竖起一根手指。"哦，对了，我忘了还有一件事…"

The ex-professor pulled out a small box from his jacket and placed it between the beer cans and the pork rinds. Misato opened it, and she was surprised to see a pair of collar pins denoting lieutenant-colonel rank, one wide black lacquer band on top and a very narrow black band below on a field of gold, the moonlight giving them a soft shine.  
前教授从夹克里掏出一个小盒子，放在啤酒罐和猪肉条之间。美里打开它，惊讶地发现里面是一对表示中校军衔的领章，上面是一条宽宽的黑漆带，下面是一条非常窄的黑带，背景是金色，月光给它们带来柔和的光泽。

"I… I'm flattered, sir," Misato mumbled, blinking her eyes twice.  
"我……我很荣幸，长官，"美里结结巴巴地说，眨了两次眼睛。

"Since I think you needed more responsibility," Fuyutsuki said, smiling, "and you're performing well in the last few days, especially with courage under fire, well, I'm promoting you to a higher rank. Congratulations, Lieutenant-Colonel Katsuragi."  
"我认为你需要承担更多责任，"冬月笑着说，"而且你最近几天表现出色，尤其是在炮火下的勇气，嗯，我决定提升你的军衔。祝贺你，葛城中校。"

Driving an unmarked Honda Civic that he requested from the motor pool, Gendo Ikari was behind the wheel, as he was heading towards Rei's apartment block. He was hoping to catch someone besides her, and if possible yank him off her body. He also had his personal side weapon in his pocket, a Walther PPK/S pistol, loaded with 9mm hollowpoint rounds in the clip, and being stone-cold he wouldn't hesitate to shoot if necessary.  
驾驶着从车队申请来的未标记本田思域，碇源堂坐在驾驶座上，正朝着绫波的公寓楼驶去。他希望能遇到除她之外的人，如有可能，将他从她身边拽开。他的口袋里还藏着一把私人配枪，一把装有 9 毫米空尖弹的瓦尔特 PPK/S 手枪，冷静如石的他，必要时绝不会犹豫开枪。

Gendo turned right, and braked at an empty parking slot. He got off and slammed the door, walking briskly towards the elevator in the apartment's lobby, cluttered with trash as he sidestepped them.  
碇源堂向右转弯，在一个空车位前刹车。他下车后用力关上车门，快步走向公寓大堂的电梯，一边侧身避开满地的垃圾。

Now he was at her front door, and Gendo knocked thrice. He could see in the gap under the door that the light went on, and Rei opened the door. She looked surprised to see him alone.  
现在他站在她的门前，碇源堂敲了三下门。透过门缝，他看到灯光亮起，绫波打开了门。她看起来对他独自前来感到惊讶。

"Good evening, Commander," Rei said. "What is it that you need?"  
“晚上好，指挥官，”丽说，“您需要什么？”

The older man murmured, taking a brief note of her long-sleeved men's shirt she was wearing for sleep, and then said, "May I enter? I want to go around and check."  
年长的男人低声说道，短暂地注意到她穿着的男士长袖睡衣，然后问道：“我可以进来吗？我想四处检查一下。”

Rei nodded as she let him inside. With one hand in his pocket, gripping the pistol, he searched every room and space in the flat, and even opened the closet and the veranda doors. Nothing to see.  
丽点点头，让他进了屋。他一手插在口袋里，紧握着手枪，仔细搜查了公寓的每个房间和角落，甚至打开了衣柜和阳台门。一切正常。

He then turned his attention to Rei, who was following, and said, "I want to warn you about Nagisa."  
随后，他将注意力转向了紧随其后的丽，说道：“我想提醒你关于渚的事。”

"What is wrong with him?" Rei asked, noticing his stern expression.  
“他有什么问题吗？”丽问道，注意到他严肃的表情。

Gendo leaned closer to Rei's face, and spoke. "Although I ordered you to socialize with him, to find out his motives because he belongs to the Committee, I warn you to be very careful. If you go a step too far and I find out, Rei, then I will decide his fate _myself_. Remember that, and your duty and your existence depends on what I tell you to do."  
源堂将脸凑近丽的脸，低声说道：“虽然我命令你与他交往，以探查他的动机，因为他属于委员会，但我警告你要非常小心。如果你走得太远，被我发现，丽，那么我将亲自决定他的命运。记住这一点，你的职责和你的存在都取决于我让你做的事情。”

Rei nodded. "I will, Commander," she replied, trying not to let her composure collapse in the face of Gendo's controlled temper. The mere mention of the word _fate_ could mean anything, including the possible use of physical violence.  
丽点点头。“我会的，指挥官，”她回答，努力不让自己的镇定在源堂的克制怒气面前崩溃。仅仅提到“命运”这个词可能意味着任何事情，包括可能使用身体暴力的可能性。

"Now, tell me, what you were doing with Nagisa throughout this afternoon? And where have you been?" Gendo asked.  
“现在，告诉我，你今天下午和渚在一起做了什么？你们去了哪里？”源堂问道。

"We had tea, and we talked. He left me alone later," she said, but inwardly her pulse rate was quickening; she was fighting the fear in her heart.  
“我们喝了茶，聊了天。后来他让我一个人待着，”她说，但内心她的心跳加速；她在与心中的恐惧作斗争。

Gendo grumbled, rejecting her terse explanation. "The cameras at Gate 18 _don't lie_. You were with him in there at six in the evening, which means he spent the whole afternoon with you before coming at that gate, and where did both of you have gone to afterwards?"  
源渡咕哝着，拒绝了她的简短解释。“18 号门的摄像头不会说谎。你和他晚上六点在里面，这意味着他整个下午都和你在一起，之后你们俩去了哪里？”

Rei felt frightened this time, her apparent lie failed to convince him as his freezing eyes burned into her cerise pupils.  
这次，绫波感到害怕，她明显的谎言未能说服他，他冰冷的目光灼烧着她紫红色的瞳孔。

"I… We went swimming," she stammered.  
“我…我们去游泳了，”她结巴道。

"What did he told you in all that time?" he demanded.  
"在那段时间里，他都跟你说了些什么？" 他质问道。

"We talked about my recovery, and what happened during the compatibility test. He never talked about himself, only about me."  
"我们谈了我的康复情况，以及兼容性测试期间发生的事情。他从未谈及自己，只谈到了我。"

Gendo scowled. _He's telling nothing, yet there should be a slip of his tongue, to give away his true intentions._ Now he noticed that Rei was afraid, so he quickly softened his expression on his face and sighed.  
碇源堂皱起眉头。他什么都没透露，但总该有一丝口误，暴露他的真实意图。现在他注意到绫波零有些害怕，于是他迅速缓和了脸上的表情，叹了口气。

"I'm sorry, Rei," Gendo apologized. "I'm doing this for your own safety because if anything serious happens to you, then all of what we worked on for years would be in vain. I do not want to lose you this time, and I will keep that promise."  
"对不起，丽，" 碇司令道歉道，"我这么做是为了你的安全，因为如果有什么严重的事情发生在你身上，那么我们多年来努力的一切都将付诸东流。这次我不想失去你，我会遵守这个承诺。"

The Commander then turned away and stormed out of her flat, leaving Rei behind. The First Children could hear from downstairs his car starting up, and then quickly motored away until the sound faded. Once she thought he was gone, Rei slowly sat on the floor, completely shaken as she wrapped her arms around the knees, terribly concerned for Kaworu.  
司令随后转身离开，怒气冲冲地走出了她的公寓，留下丽一个人。第一适格者能从楼下听到他的车启动的声音，然后迅速驶离，直到声音消失。当她以为他已经离开时，丽缓缓坐在地板上，完全被震撼了，她紧紧抱住膝盖，对渚非常担忧。

---

Feeling elated with her new rank, Misato watched Fuyutsuki, sans jacket, take a sip and exhale as they savored the night breeze blowing over the lake.  
对新晋升的军衔感到兴奋，美里看着没有穿外套的冬月，他们一边品味着湖面上吹来的夜风，一边啜饮着饮料，享受着这份宁静。

"I once used to be here, hanging around during lunchtime or when off-duty," Fuyutsuki began recalling, while nursing his drink. "Back in the days when we're just Gehirn, running the AEL and we were making breakthroughs by the day, some of it making headlines. To most people, they think we're like the Salk Institute or CERN; we are to the human genome what those two are into vaccines and nuclear physics. But we're really working for a powerful group, building a man-made god."  
"我曾经常在这里，午休或下班时闲逛，" 冬月开始回忆，同时轻啜着饮料。"那是在我们还是 Gehirn，运营 AEL 的日子，我们每天都有突破，有些甚至上了头条。对大多数人来说，他们认为我们像索尔克研究所或 CERN；我们在人类基因组方面的研究，就像那两家在疫苗和核物理领域的地位。但实际上，我们是在为一个强大的组织工作，打造一个人造的神。"

"The Committee?" Misato asked. She thought of the five old men whom she met once in the holographic communications room and debriefed them on Shinji and Unit-01 as the boy's representative.  
"委员会？" 美里问道。她想起了那五位老者，她曾在全息通信室与他们见面，并代表真嗣和初号机向他们汇报。

"SEELE," Fuyutsuki corrected her. "They're all behind this, those old men behind their domino blocks, meddling with us even up to now. Well, I once tried to blow their whole charade wide-open, but someone told me otherwise that before I could reveal the truth behind Second Impact, they'll take me out of the picture.  
"SEELE，" 冬月纠正她。"这一切都是他们幕后操纵的，那些戴着多米诺骨牌面具的老人们，至今仍在干涉我们。好吧，我曾试图揭穿他们的整个骗局，但有人告诉我，如果我在揭露第二次冲击的真相之前，他们就会让我消失。

"Eventually I wound up joining Gehirn, as a product of damage control, and hoping that I might do something right from within. Oh, that someone was Yui Ikari, and she was the only one on equal footing with those old men, taking the fight within their system, and she stayed on as a member for Shinji's sake."  
最终，我为了挽回局面加入了 GEHIRN，并希望能在内部做些正确的事。哦，那个人是碇唯，她是唯一能与那些老狐狸平起平坐的人，在他们的体系内斗争，并且为了真嗣留在了那里。

Fuyutsuki sighed, as he gestured at the oak tree branches over their heads. "I was here on this very spot," he said, "talking about her intentions as she took care of Shinji. She found out what they were up to at the time, and vigorously opposed their plans, so I supported her struggle.  
"冬月叹了口气，指着头顶的橡树枝说道：“我就在这个位置，”他说，“谈论着她的意图，当时她在照顾真嗣。她发现了他们当时的阴谋，并强烈反对他们的计划，所以我支持她的斗争。”

"But once they were closing on her, there were just three options: either to be liquidated, give up and follow, or simply do the unthinkable. In defiance, she chose the last one, by conducting a contact experiment in Unit One as a test subject, even if it was half-finished at that time."  
"“但当他们逼近她时，只有三种选择：要么被清算，要么放弃并顺从，要么干脆做出不可思议的事。她选择了最后一种，通过在未完成的初号机中进行接触实验作为测试对象，以示反抗。”

"Which since then is the only one to surprise us more than any other Eva in our inventory," Misato added, knocking back her drink.  
"自从那以后，这是唯一一个让我们比库存中任何其他 Eva 都更感惊讶的存在，" 美里补充道，一口喝干了她的饮料。

"Yes," Fuyutsuki agreed. "All along I realized where she placed her trust and faith in. Not with SEELE, not with her husband, but _me_. And after that contact experiment I felt deeply responsible for her safety, but she had to do it, she obviously intended to remain in that Eva to look after Shinji, even if—pardon me—Gendo tried to bring her back. We salvaged what was left, and instead we created Rei out of her DNA. Much to his chagrin, Rei has her _own_ personality, so since then he tried to instill his persona into her."  
"是的，" 冬月同意道。"一直以来，我意识到她将信任和信仰寄托在谁身上。不是 SEELE，不是她的丈夫，而是我。在那次接触实验之后，我深感对她安全的责任，但她必须这么做，她显然打算留在那个 Eva 里照顾真嗣，即使——请原谅我——碇试图将她带回来。我们抢救了剩下的部分，反而用她的 DNA 创造了绫波。令他懊恼的是，绫波有自己的个性，所以从那时起，他试图将自己的性格灌输给她。

"The product of your frustration…" Misato mentioned the words he said earlier shortly before they were disrupted by Unit-01.  
"你挫败的产物……" 美里提到了他之前不久说的话，就在他们被初号机打断之前。

"And all of Ikari's hopes," Fuyutsuki completed the sentence, and the ex-professor shook his head. "Yes, it's hard forgetting anymore."  
"以及碇的所有希望，" 冬月完成了这句话，这位前教授摇了摇头。"是的，再也无法忘记了。"

"There's another thing that I would like you to look into, sir," Misato said, changing the subject.  
"还有一件事，我想请您调查一下，先生，" 美里改变了话题。"

Fuyutsuki frowned. "What's that?"  
冬月皱起眉头。"什么事？"

"There appears to be some indications that other Evas are being built elsewhere."  
"似乎有迹象表明，其他 EVA 正在别处建造。"

Misato again pulled the notebook computer to her and went to a folder where she stored some intelligence reports that Makoto Hyuga gave to her a few days ago. She opened the documents and the pictures, showing them to Fuyutsuki. This time he looked grave.  
美里再次将笔记本电脑拉到自己面前，打开了一个文件夹，里面存放着几天前东治日向交给她的情报报告。她打开文档和图片，展示给冬月看。这一次，他的表情变得严肃起来。

"That's troubling news," the older man worried. "If all of that information that your source had given to you are correct, then it appears that they're arraying the other NERV branches against us by independently developing these Evas without our knowledge. If that's the case, it's not impossible that they could be using the data obtained from the Dummy Plug System and S2 Engine development. Thereafter, they could utilize that information into these new Evas."  
"这消息令人不安，"老人担忧地说，"如果你们的消息来源提供的信息都是准确的，那么看来他们正利用其他 NERV 支部独立开发这些 EVA，而我们却毫不知情。如果真是这样，他们很可能利用了从傀儡系统与 S2 引擎开发中获得的数据。之后，他们可以将这些信息应用到这些新 EVA 上。"

"Which leaves me wondering what the hell they're going to do with them," Misato said. "That's so much money to spend, especially for a weapon too powerful than a nuclear arsenal."  
“这让我不禁好奇他们到底打算拿它们怎么办，”美里说，“那可是巨额资金，尤其是对于一种比核武库还要强大的武器。”

Fuyutsuki shook his head. "I don't think we're due to have some sort of a final, massed Angel attack against us. I think they have a darker motive beyond our imagining."  
冬月摇了摇头。“我不认为我们会遭遇某种大规模的最终天使攻击。我想他们有着超出我们想象的更黑暗的动机。”

Kaworu looked back at the apartment complex, now very far from where he was as he walked back to the Geofront. He wished he could come in and spend the rest of the night with Rei, yet the Commander spoiled that chance. He was also worried about her being in that man's hands, deciding every twist and turn of her life like a puppeteer.  
"渚薰回头望向那座公寓楼，此时已离他很远，因为他正步行返回地底都市。他多希望能进去与绫波共度余夜，然而司令官破坏了这一机会。他也担心她落入那人手中，像操纵木偶般决定她生命的每一个转折。”

Disappointed, Kaworu hiked on with his hands in his pockets, reviewing the day's events in his mind. He wondered if his presence caused a widespread chain of reactions, some of them he never foresaw. Furthermore, he knew well that his days are numbered, that the old men were waiting for him to fulfill their wishes. He remembered them now, and reminded that there will be another debriefing due to be made before the SEELE congregation tomorrow night.  
失望之余，渚薰双手插兜继续前行，脑海中回顾着这一天的种种。他不禁思索，自己的存在是否引发了一系列连锁反应，其中有些是他未曾预见的。更甚者，他深知自己的时日无多，那些老人们正等着他去实现他们的愿望。此刻，他记起了他们，并提醒自己，明晚在 SEELE 集会前还有一场汇报要做。

He played around with Rei's earlier suggestion of changing things and altering the present to affect the future. Yes, it's possible, as the girl couldn't accept his inevitable fate.  
他琢磨着绫波之前提出的改变现状、影响未来的建议。没错，这是可能的，正如她无法接受他注定的命运。

Then how?

A thought came up, a brilliant plan that sounded outrageous in concept.  
一个念头浮现，一个听起来荒诞不经却异常精妙的计划。

It was possible, but in practice could also be a very long shot, and would take some effort to make the plan work. He will have to find out and study other dormant faculties he possessed, as he only had abilities to absorb other Lilim's memories, levitate and generate an AT Field.  
这并非不可能，但实际操作起来可能希望渺茫，且需要付出不少努力才能让计划成功。他必须发掘并研究自己其他潜在的能力，因为他目前仅能吸收其他莉莉姆的记忆、悬浮以及生成 AT 力场。

Kaworu nodded. _Yes, I'll show them what they wanted to see._  
“薰点头道：“是的，我会让他们看到他们想看到的。”

---

"Damn," Misato muttered. "Never thought it would be so soon, now that there's the last Angel in our midst. Afterwards, what's going to happen?"  
“该死，”美里低声咒骂，“从未想过会这么快，现在我们中间出现了最后一个使徒。之后会发生什么？”

Fuyutsuki's forehead furrowed. "It's very uncertain," he said, "and since I don't think we'll have a peaceful end to all this, I approved the black budget for new weaponry should things come to worse. As far as I'm concerned, and since Commander Ikari's leadership is faltering along with the growing discontent within the rank-and-file, not to mention the diminishing relationship he has with SEELE, I'm doing my best to keep things under control; I don't want to be there standing like a fool while people die right in front of me."  
冬月皱起了眉头。“情况非常不确定，”他说，“而且我认为我们不会有一个和平的结局，所以我批准了黑色预算用于新武器，以防事态恶化。就我而言，鉴于碇司令的领导力随着基层不满情绪的增长而动摇，更不用说他与 SEELE 的关系日益疏远，我正尽我所能控制局面；我不想像个傻瓜一样站在那里，眼睁睁看着人们在我面前死去。”

Misato sighed. "I have to admit," she said, "in some ways you're what my father should have been."  
美里叹了口气。“我不得不承认，”她说，“在某些方面，你才是我父亲应有的样子。”

"Why?" Fuyutsuki asked. “为什么？”冬月问。

The young woman drank some of her beer and said, "You have this heart, selflessness within, and you possess an integrity that doesn't yield to corruption or malice even after many years, and of course you're up to the challenge now to set things right. Above all, you're never _ambitious_.  
"年轻女子喝了一口啤酒，说道：“你拥有一颗无私的心，多年后依然保持着不屈服于腐败和恶意的正直。当然，你现在有能力纠正这一切。最重要的是，你从不野心勃勃。”

"My father, on the other hand, was selfish and obsessed with his own work, which is why sometimes I had little respect for him even after all these years. He died trying to get me out, however, and so later I joined NERV, not because I wanted to avenge him, but to escape his shadow."  
"“而我父亲则自私且沉迷于自己的工作，这也是为什么这么多年后我对他仍缺乏尊重。然而，他在试图救我时去世了，因此后来我加入了 NERV，并非为了替他复仇，而是为了摆脱他的阴影。”

For a brief moment, Misato looked down into the gaping orifice of her can, and shaking the contents to see if there was still some beer left over. She then picked up another piece of pork rind and crunched on it.  
米莎托短暂地低头看向手中罐子的开口处，摇晃着检查是否还有剩余的啤酒。随后，她拿起另一片猪皮，咔嚓咔嚓地嚼了起来。

"In a way," she continued after chewing and swallowing, "and I never intended to flatter you much, sir, but you're like a father to the most of us, looking after us, and maybe worrying as well. I swear there's some who look up upon you as an example, and I'm not alone in saying this, and when you're not around, they become worried. For the life of me, however, I haven't asked you this, but… why did you remain lonely?"  
"在某种程度上，"她咀嚼并吞咽后继续说道，"先生，我从未打算过多奉承您，但您对我们大多数人来说就像父亲一样，照顾我们，也许还担忧着。我敢说有些人把您视为榜样，我这么说并不孤单，而当您不在时，他们会感到担忧。然而，我从未问过您这个问题，但……您为何一直孤独？"

Fuyutsuki propped his chin, thinking until he sighed. "I… I had a deep affection for Shinji's mother, yet I didn't admit it at all, fearing that I could very well get myself in trouble if I did. Yes, I kept this secret of unrequited love in my heart for years, and instead, as a tribute to her, I poured my efforts trying to make the so-called 'future of mankind' a reality."  
冬月撑着下巴，沉思良久后叹了口气。"我……我对真嗣的母亲有着深厚的感情，但我从未承认过，因为我害怕这会给我带来麻烦。是的，多年来我一直将这份未得到回应的爱藏在心底，相反，为了纪念她，我倾尽全力试图让所谓的'人类未来'成为现实。"

With longing, the ex-professor made a soft beat with a fist upon his thigh. He could picture the day he first met Yui in his classroom, standing before him with a folder in her hands, wearing a white coat over her light floral-patterned dress. For someone so brilliant, she was also beautiful even without much makeup; a gentle face with dark green eyes that radiated intellect and a passion for life.  
带着渴望，这位前教授轻轻地用拳头敲打着自己的大腿。他仿佛能看到第一次在教室里见到唯的那一天，她站在他面前，手里拿着文件夹，穿着一件浅色花卉图案的连衣裙，外面套着白大褂。她如此聪慧，即使不化妆也很美丽；一张温柔的脸庞，深绿色的眼睛闪烁着智慧和对生活的热情。

"But really," he said with regret in his voice, "I wished I could just have the time to know her more, and regretfully I should have admitted my feelings to her a long time ago. From that day I met Yui, sometimes I daydream of her, and often my heart aches with regret every time she's in my mind, even though the Commander has grown obsessed with her ever since she was lost into Unit One."  
"但说真的，" 他的声音中带着遗憾，"我真希望有更多时间去了解她，遗憾的是我早该向她坦白我的感情。自从那天遇见唯，我时常幻想她，每当她在我脑海中浮现，我的心就因悔恨而隐隐作痛，尽管指挥官自从她失踪进入初号机后，就对她念念不忘。"

Misato shook her head.  
美里摇了摇头。

"Sometimes I wished I had the will to tell him to let go, think of what he's doing to our world, to us, and especially to his son," Fuyutsuki said, and he took a swig. "But it's his ego that's in the way. Worse, the Committee is unstoppable, as the ball's already rolling even before you came here. For now, I think we'll try to delay the unavoidable before it knocks on our door."  
"有时候我真希望我有勇气告诉他放手，想想他对我们的世界、对我们，尤其是对他的儿子做了什么，" 冬月说道，并喝了一口酒。"但他的自尊心挡在了路上。更糟的是，委员会势不可挡，在你来之前，事情就已经在推进了。眼下，我想我们会尽力拖延那不可避免的命运，直到它敲响我们的门。"

The older man looked up to the sky, having spotted the streak of a meteorite burning up quickly into the darkness as it appeared.  
年长的男人抬头望向天空，注意到一颗流星迅速划过黑暗，燃烧殆尽。

"Anyway, going back to her, she told me this…"  
“无论如何，回到她的话题，她告诉我这个……”

_Fuyutsuki looked puzzled. "Humans create Evangelion in imitation of God... Is this what we're really aspiring for?" he wondered.  
冬月看起来有些困惑。“人类模仿上帝创造出 EVA……这真的是我们所追求的吗？”他思索着。_

_Yui nodded. "Yes, Professor," she replied, still using his old professional title. "Humans can only live on this planet, but I have a vision: Evangelion can live eternally... together with the human soul that dwells within it."  
Yui 点了点头。“是的，教授，”她回答道，仍然使用他过去的职业称呼。“人类只能在这颗星球上生存，但我有一个愿景：EVA 可以永生……与其中居住的人类灵魂一起。”_

_They could feel the breeze blowing across the park and beyond the levee, tree branches swaying in the wind. Birds could still be heard chirping, as they flew from branch to branch. Yui now began to pick up Shinji from the stroller, and hefted the toddler upon her bosom. The woman looked into her son's face and smiled at him, and he giggled in return.  
他们能感受到公园和堤坝外吹来的微风，树枝在风中摇曳。鸟儿依然在枝头间飞来飞去，鸣叫着。Yui 开始从婴儿车里抱起 Shinji，将这个幼儿抱在胸前。她看着儿子的脸，对他微笑，而他则咯咯地笑了起来。_

"_Even after billions of years," Yui continued, facing Fuyutsuki while she rocked Shinji in her arms, "when the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun have long gone into dust, it will still exist as long as that one person within still lives, though it's also a very lonely journey."_  
“即使经过数十亿年，”Yui 继续说道，面对着 Fuyutsuki，同时摇晃着怀中的 Shinji，“当地球、月亮和太阳早已化为尘埃，只要其中那一个人依然活着，它就会继续存在，尽管这也是一段非常孤独的旅程。”

_Fuyutsuki nodded and smiled lightly. "If you succeed, it would be the eternal and enduring proof that humankind has existed, and would be judged by others with that proof."  
冬月点了点头，轻轻地笑了。“如果你成功了，那将是人类存在永恒不变的证明，也将以此证明被他人评判。”_

"That is her intent, her mission, an idea that the Eva should be a universal and living symbol of human triumph in the face of difficulties throughout its evolution, but she did not wish to see it turned into a weapon of mass destruction for the power-hungry, as in the case of our past history. Obviously I think she foresaw that Shinji would become Unit One's pilot because in her mind he's least likely to use Eva to terrorize mankind."  
“那是她的意图，她的使命，一个理念，认为 Eva 应该成为人类在进化过程中面对困难取得胜利的普遍而鲜活的象征，但她不希望看到它变成权力欲望者手中的大规模毁灭性武器，就像我们过去的历史上那样。显然，我认为她预见到真嗣会成为初号机的驾驶员，因为在她看来，他最不可能利用 Eva 来恐吓人类。”

The ex-professor closed his eyes for a while. He ran a hand through his hair, and sighed.  
前教授闭上了眼睛一会儿。他用手梳理了一下头发，叹了口气。

"In the process of trying to carry on her legacy, while having to bear with the Commander's tendencies, _all_ because of her, I have a good reason to pay more attention to the Children, especially for Shinji, who's taking much of the brunt more than any of us. Yes, everytime I see them go out to battle, deep inside me, I always wonder why do we have to send these flawed young people out there, all because the fate of mankind depends on them, and in the same way that I felt accountable for Yui's life, I also have a deep sense of responsibility for their well-being."  
"在试图继承她的遗志的同时，不得不忍受司令的倾向，全都是因为她，我有充分的理由更加关注孩子们，尤其是真嗣，他承受的压力比我们任何人都多。是的，每次看到他们出征，我内心深处总会疑惑，为什么我们必须派遣这些有缺陷的年轻人上战场，仅仅因为人类的命运寄托在他们身上，正如我对唯的生命感到有责任一样，我对他们的安危也深感责任重大。"

Fuyutsuki turned to Misato, and said, "Since you're their guardian, understand that more than ever the Children are vulnerable, so keep on protecting them, as though they're your siblings."  
冬月转向美里，说道：“既然你是他们的监护人，就要比以往任何时候都明白孩子们的脆弱，所以要像保护自己的兄弟姐妹一样保护他们。”

"It's my responsibility, and always will be, sir," Misato answered.  
“这是我的责任，而且永远都是，先生，”美里回答道。

"Not just that," Fuyutsuki said. "We're all responsible for everything he does."  
“不仅如此，”冬月说，“我们都得为他所做的一切负责。”

In Mexico City and on a sweltering afternoon, a man was running through the narrow alleys of a vast slum, being pursued by a pair of men coming behind him, shooting with silenced pistols. He was breathing profusely, sweating, desperate to get out of this claustrophobic maze yet confused as to where he was supposed to go. He could hear dogs barking at him, some of them tugging against their chains and threatening to bite him. He crashed into trash cans, corrugated cartons, piles of empty PET bottles, or clotheslines laden with wet laundry. His feet sometimes found a muddy puddle or worse, dog poop. But the squalor or the dirt was irrelevant, nor the slum-dwellers' indifference was of his concern; survival and escape were the only things in his mind.  
在墨西哥城的一个酷热下午，一名男子正穿过一个庞大贫民窟的狭窄巷弄，身后两名男子持着装有消音器的手枪紧追不舍。他呼吸急促，汗流浃背，拼命想逃离这个令人窒息的迷宫，却又不知该往何处去。他能听到狗对着他狂吠，有些狗挣着链子，似乎随时准备扑上来咬他。他撞翻了垃圾桶、波纹纸箱、成堆的空 PET 瓶，或是挂满湿衣服的晾衣绳。他的脚不时踩进泥泞的水坑，甚至更糟，踩到狗屎。但肮脏或污秽无关紧要，贫民窟居民的冷漠也不在他的考虑范围内；生存和逃脱是他心中唯一的念头。

Suddenly a man blocked his way, standing tall. The fugitive was taken aback, and was about to make another detour into yet another alley when he heard a muffled pop and a can landed on the cracked pavement with a clank, and a hole shot right through.  
突然，一个人挡住了他的去路，高大挺立。逃亡者吃了一惊，正准备再次绕进另一条小巷时，他听到了一声闷响，一个罐子落在裂开的人行道上发出叮当声，随即被子弹贯穿了一个洞。

"W… What the hell do you want?" the fugitive demanded. He could now make out, from the man's silhouette in the dim light, a pistol in his hand with a sound suppressor screwed in. For a second, the grim determination on the man's face nervously reminded him of a deer hunter.  
"你……你到底想要什么？"逃犯质问道。在昏暗的光线下，他现在能从那人的轮廓中辨认出，他手中握着一把装有消音器的手枪。有那么一瞬间，那人脸上冷酷的决心让他紧张地想起了猎鹿人。

"Simple," the hunter answered, quickly aiming the weapon straight into his eyes. "You die."  
"简单，"猎人回答，迅速将枪口直指他的眼睛。"你去死。"

The fugitive never heard the near-quiet 9mm shot that drilled into his skull, blasting his brains out from the exit. He, the victim, was Seymour Nunn, the famous astronomer who purportedly discovered the meteorite that crashed into Antarctica fifteen years ago, now known forever as the Second Impact.  
逃犯从未听到那几乎无声的 9 毫米子弹射入他的头骨，从出口处炸开他的脑浆。他，受害者，是著名天文学家西摩·纳恩，据称十五年前发现了坠入南极洲的陨石，如今永远被称为第二次冲击。

The hunter walked over to the astronomer's corpse, purloined his watch and wallet, and then pulled the trigger twice, the corpse shuddering from the bullets, before walking away. If there were witnesses, they wouldn't dare to report, as this slum was part of a crime warlord's empire and they would assume that it was yet another daily drug slay.  
猎人走向天文学家的尸体，顺手牵羊拿走了他的手表和钱包，然后连开两枪，尸体因子弹的冲击而颤抖，随后猎人便扬长而去。如果有目击者，他们也不敢报案，因为这个贫民窟属于一个犯罪军阀的帝国，他们会认为这只是日常的毒品谋杀案之一。

The death of Nunn was necessary to protect their secret; after many years Nunn was planning to destroy the well-constructed whitewash with his revelations. By now a couple of hitmen like him were somewhere at the other side of the city, trashing up Nunn's home, destroying any possible evidence their victim would divulge to the world, before setting the whole place up in flames.  
杀死纳恩是为了保护他们的秘密；经过多年，纳恩正计划用他的揭露来摧毁这个精心构建的掩盖真相。此时此刻，像他这样的几个杀手正在城市的另一边，捣毁纳恩的家，销毁受害者可能向世界透露的任何证据，然后放火将整个地方化为灰烬。

By the time he was in the clear after three miles away, the hunter pulled out his phone from the jacket and dialed. He was standing in front of a cantina, and a pair of drunks staggered out of the door, heading home.  
当他离开三英里远，确认安全后，猎人从夹克里掏出手机拨打电话。他站在一家小酒馆前，一对醉汉踉踉跄跄地从门口出来，朝家走去。

"Yes?" the other man on the line answered, his voice scrambled.  
“喂？”电话那头的男人应道，声音模糊不清。

"It's done as you wanted. Made it look like a simple robbery," the hunter said.  
"正如你所愿，弄得像是普通的抢劫案，"猎人说道。

"Most excellent. I'm transferring the rest of the payment to your account as promised."  
"非常好。我这就按约定将剩余的报酬转账到你的账户。"

The hunter nodded. "Thanks, Mister Chairman."  
猎人点头。"谢谢，主席先生。"

**Author's Notes:** There were several revisions of this chapter, and in the process of finding the right flow, I rejected some (yet to be reused sometimes later). I liked to give Fuyutsuki a chance to open his heart to someone he could actually confide in, and at the same time look into some sides of the other characters. Again, it's a tough act while writing this, especially with the character development, and digging up source material to add more strength.  
作者笔记：这篇chapter经过多次修订，在寻找合适的叙述节奏过程中，我舍弃了一些内容（有时日后会重新利用）。我喜欢给冬月一个机会，让他向一个真正能倾诉的人敞开心扉，同时也能深入探索其他角色的某些侧面。再次强调，写作这篇作品颇具挑战，尤其是在角色发展和挖掘原始素材以增强力度方面。

The title of this chapter is based on the fact that Fuyutsuki means "the winter moon", and it's also the same name of an IJN destroyer, hence the moonlit December night setting for their drinking binge. Some of the place names in the fic are real, so I'm thanking the folks at Hakone for their tourist information website and maps.  
这篇chapter的标题源于“冬月”一词，它既是 Fuyutsuki 的名字，也是 IJN（日本帝国海军）一艘驱逐舰的名称，因此故事设定在月光下的十二月夜晚，他们畅饮狂欢。文中部分地名是真实的，在此感谢箱根的旅游信息网站和地图。

I'm also highly indebted to Rachel "Reichu" Clark and her gang at for their invaluable wealth of Eva information, as well as to the pioneering efforts of Brendan Jamieson, Patrick Yip, Bochan Bird, the guys who worked on the translated Eva TV/movie scripts, and many others in the fan community. Without their decade-and-a-half-long intensive research work, it would have been difficult for me to get past Chapter 10+=*.  
我同样深感对 Rachel "Reichu" Clark 及其团队在 Eva 信息方面的宝贵贡献表示感激，也要感谢 Brendan Jamieson、Patrick Yip、Bochan Bird 以及那些致力于翻译 Eva 电视/电影剧本的同仁们，还有众多粉丝社区中的其他成员。没有他们长达十五年的深入研究工作，我很难突破Chapter 10+=*这一难关。

More coming up later!  
更多内容即将呈现！

Chapter 21 号夜班守墓

The killer was dressed in black, with his favorite killing weapon holstered behind his back. He was on top of an electric post, wearing well-insulated gloves, planting a small plastic explosive charge on the transformer, careful not to come close to the live lines. He would remotely detonate it as soon as he positioned himself on the balcony a floor over Katsuragi's flat. Once the power was down, he would get in and kill the girl and their guardians, but leave the Third Children alive.  
杀手身着黑衣，他最钟爱的杀人武器藏于背后。他站在电线杆顶端，戴着绝缘手套，小心翼翼地在变压器上安置一枚小型塑料炸药，避免触碰到带电线路。一旦他移动到葛城家楼上的阳台，就会远程引爆。电力中断后，他将潜入并杀死女孩及其监护人，但留下第三适格者活口。

Personally, he was excited about looking forward to look at the woman's face for any final reaction, before shooting her in the head and then the heart, just like her lover.  
就个人而言，他期待着在向她头部和心脏开枪前，能亲眼目睹她最后的反应，就像对待她的爱人那样。

Director Shuya Hamamoto was back into the interrogation room, after guzzling a large mug of coffee and two bars of Calorimate to add more stamina. He was bent on getting his results from one of the surviving International Resistance members, who was sitting on a chair, cuffed and looked determined not to sing. He looked American, white and in his thirties, and with a stubble on his chin, and his eyes looked as if he had seen his share of violence.  
导演东山修也回到了审讯室，之前他灌下了一大杯咖啡和两块卡路瑞麦特来增加体力。他决心要从一名幸存的国际抵抗组织成员那里得到结果，那人坐在椅子上，被铐着，看起来决心不开口。他看起来是美国人，三十多岁，皮肤白皙，下巴上有胡茬，眼神似乎经历过不少暴力。

Hamamoto sighed, and began to ask this man for the umpteenth time.  
东山叹了口气，开始第无数次询问这个人。

"All right, you're trying my patience today, William Swinton," he said. "Who funded your venture to attack one of the Children today… No, damn, I mean yesterday afternoon?"  
“好吧，威廉·斯温顿，你今天真是考验我的耐心，”他说。“是谁资助你们攻击今天……不，该死，我是说昨天下午的孩子们？”

Swinton snorted, but inwardly he was laughing at Hamamoto for forgetting the time on the clock above their heads: it was past twelve midnight.  
斯温顿哼了一声，但内心却在嘲笑滨本忘记了他们头顶上的时钟时间：已经过了午夜十二点。

"According to Interpol and FBI records," Hamamoto read from a stapled printout, "You're an ex-US Marine, dishonorably discharged after five years of service as corporal due to an infraction, then joined the IR around 2010."  
“根据国际刑警组织和联邦调查局的记录，”滨本从一份订好的打印文件中读道，“你是一名前美国海军陆战队队员，因违纪行为在服役五年后被不名誉地退伍，随后于 2010 年左右加入了爱尔兰共和军。”

The old director cleared his throat.  
老局长清了清喉咙。

"You were involved as a suspect in at least eighteen incidents against the United Nations alone, evaded arrest thrice, had a prison sentence for six years for manslaughter and treason, but reduced to two years thanks to some lawyers… and what a country you have, a lawyer for almost every American."  
"你仅针对联合国就至少涉嫌参与了十八起事件，三次逃脱逮捕，因过失杀人和叛国罪被判六年监禁，后因某些律师的辩护减至两年……你们国家真是了不起，几乎每个美国人都有律师。"

Hamamoto glared at Swinton. "But since you messed with us, this time I don't think you'll be out of here."  
滨本瞪着斯温顿。"但你这次惹到我们了，我看你别想轻易脱身。"

"I ain't gonna sing to the likes of you," Swinton retorted. "Name, rank, serial number. That's all you gonna get from me."  
"我可不会对你们这种人开口，"斯温顿反驳道。"姓名、军衔、编号。这就是你们能从我这儿得到的全部。"

Hamamoto bit his lip, trying to control his temper after his men ate all seven hours of grilling these thugs. All they did was to say the same damned thing all over, so he suspected that while serving in active military duty, they were taught about interrogation tactics and what they were expected to endure if captured.  
浜本咬着嘴唇，试图控制自己的怒火，因为他的手下们已经连续七个小时烧烤这些恶棍。他们所做的只是不断重复同样该死的话，这让浜本怀疑，他们在服役期间是否接受了审讯战术的训练，以及在被捕时他们预期要承受什么。

But after an hour of asking the same questions, the old director had enough.  
但在重复提问一个小时后，老导演已经受够了。

In order to break this dreary holding pattern, and possibly to save his standing, it was now time for some drastic measures. He left the room, nodded to the two agents to keep an eye on Swinton, and walked to the desk, picked up the phone. He then dialed up the crew chief in charge of the Entry Plugs down below at the Eva cages.  
为了打破这种沉闷的僵局，并可能挽救自己的地位，现在是时候采取一些极端措施了。他离开房间，向两名特工点头示意继续监视斯温顿，然后走到桌前，拿起电话。他随后拨通了负责伊娃驾驶舱下方的机组负责人的电话。

"This is Sergeant Kasuga speaking," the other man at the end answered. "What can I do for you?"  
"我是加须川曹长，" 另一端的男子回答道。"有什么需要帮忙的吗？"

"Director Hamamoto here," the old director said. "Listen, I have a little request that must be done immediately. Here's how it works…"  
"我是滨本局长，" 老局长说道。"听着，我有个紧急请求必须立即执行。事情是这样的……"

Kaworu Nagisa was back in his quarters, with the desk lamp on, as he couldn't get himself to sleep. The kiss still lingered in his mind, and his heart finally knew the right answer to the question that previously gnawed him after rescuing Rei.  
渚薰回到自己的房间，桌上的台灯亮着，因为他无法入睡。那个吻仍萦绕在他的脑海中，他的心终于找到了在救出绫波后一直困扰他的问题的正确答案。

Now he wondered what better he needed to do, and since the small room had a computer and a television set, Kaworu grabbed the remote control and turned on the TV first, to find a movie on air right now. There was an informative caption on the right-hand side; the movie was _William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet_, the modernized Baz Luhrmann version, pre-Second Impact.  
现在他思索着自己还需做些什么，既然这个小房间里有电脑和电视机，碇真嗣便拿起遥控器先打开了电视，想找部正在播放的电影。屏幕右侧有一行说明文字；电影是威廉·莎士比亚的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》，现代化的巴兹·鲁赫曼版本，前第二次冲击时期。

Now he began to watch Romeo Montague go to a side passage and espy Juliet Capulet on the balcony, contemplating as she watched the stars. The Fifth Children was mesmerized, as the characters went on exchanging verses, of love, passion, hatred, with the war between the families in the background, taking place entirely in Verona Beach.  
他开始观看罗密欧·蒙太古走向一条侧道，窥见朱丽叶·凯普莱特在阳台上，凝视着星空沉思。第五适格者被深深吸引，随着角色们交换着关于爱情、激情、仇恨的诗句，背景中是两家之间的战争，整个故事发生在维罗纳海滩。

Eventually he came upon the denouement, in which because of miscommunication the star-crossed lovers die by their own hands, followed by the grieving of both families, regretting their actions and paying the price for their feud.  
最终他看到了结局，由于误解，这对命运多舛的恋人自尽身亡，随后是两家人的悲痛，后悔自己的行为并为这场纷争付出代价。

Satisfied once the credits began to roll, Kaworu now had an idea, so he shut off the TV and got up to turn on the computer. There was a webcam attached to the monitor, he opened a video-recording program, and the camera's LED power indicator blinked, ready to film. Kaworu took a deep breath to calm down.  
当片尾字幕开始滚动，感到满意的渚薰此刻有了一个主意，他关掉电视，起身去打开电脑。显示器上连接着一台摄像头，他启动了视频录制程序，摄像头的电源指示灯闪烁着，准备开始拍摄。渚薰深吸一口气，试图平复心情。

"Before I would like to explain, first I want to admit…" he began, the love theme still playing in his mind.  
“在我解释之前，首先我想承认……”他开口说道，脑海中依然回荡着那段爱情主题曲。

Misato parked the Alpine right in front of Fuyutsuki's home, and the old man got out. As he felt for the keys to his door while holding his coat and briefcase, Fuyutsuki looked back at her and said, "Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you."  
美里将阿尔派停在富士树月的家门前，老人下了车。他一手拿着外套和公文包，摸索着门钥匙，回头对美里说：“嗯，和你交谈真是愉快。”

The woman nodded. "Me too," she said, smiling.  
女人点了点头。“我也是，”她微笑着说。

"There's one thing I like to say before you go."  
“在你离开之前，有一句话我想说。”

"What's it, sir?"

Fuyutsuki sighed. "I beg your pardon, but I wonder if you still loved Kaji."  
冬月叹了口气。“请原谅我的冒昧，但我好奇你是否还爱着加持。”

"How did you know?" Misato wondered.  
"你怎么知道的？" 美里疑惑道。

"He admitted to me as he got me freed. Apart from seeking the truth, even at the cost of his life, he also said that for all of his mistakes in life, he loved you and so he wanted to entrust you the task of dealing with his unfinished business."  
"他向我坦白时，我被释放了。除了不惜生命寻求真相外，他还说，尽管他一生犯了许多错误，但他爱你，因此他想把处理他未竟事业的任务托付给你。"

"That's one of my imperatives now, sir," Misato said. "It's the only way I could to honor his memory."  
"这是我现在的一项重要任务，长官，" 美里说。"这是我唯一能用来纪念他的方式。"

There was a moment of silence between them before Fuyutsuki broke the silence. "We'll have to be very careful from now on," he said, having opened the front door.  
他们之间有片刻的沉默，随后冬月打破了沉默。“从现在开始，我们必须非常小心，”他说着，打开了前门。

"I will, sir," Misato avowed. "I thank you for the honor of sharing yourself with me," she added, feeling grateful. "I'll see you later, then."  
“我会的，先生，”美里郑重承诺。“感谢您与我分享自己，”她补充道，心中充满感激。“那我们回头见。”

"You too," Fuyutsuki answered. "Be careful down the road, Katsuragi."  
“你也是，”冬月回答。“路上小心，葛城。”

"No problem," she said, smiling while opening the Alpine's door. "Thank you and good morning, sir."  
"没问题，" 她微笑着打开阿尔卑斯的车门，"谢谢您，早上好，先生。"

Fuyutsuki now watched Misato start the car and then she motored away from the curb. Once the taillights winked out of sight, he went inside and closed the door, and in the living room, he switched on the table lamp before laying his coat and briefcase on the rug.  
冬月现在看着美里启动汽车，然后她驶离了路边。一旦尾灯消失在视线中，他便走进屋内，关上门，在客厅里，他打开桌上的台灯，然后将外套和公文包放在地毯上。

He then sank down to his couch and lay there, wheezing profusely as the alcohol had exacted a toll on his 60-plus cardiopulmonary system. More importantly, however, he was at least happy within to be able to talk to someone other than Gendo, confiding to Misato all of his feelings and his intimate secrets; talking with Gendo was like walking on a minefield, as he picked his words carefully before that man's presence.  
随后，他瘫坐在沙发上，喘息不止，酒精对他的六十多岁心肺系统造成了沉重负担。然而，更重要的是，他至少内心感到欣慰，能够与除了碇以外的人交谈，向美里倾诉他所有的感受和私密秘密；与碇交谈就像在雷区行走，他必须在那个人面前小心翼翼地选择言辞。

Fuyutsuki glanced at the bookshelf opposite him, mostly a collection of fiction he gathered over the years. Reminded of one of his fictional favorites to kill time at the boat city back then, reading the weighty _Lord of the Rings;_ at the time the Children were falling apart, he sometimes compared himself to Gandalf trying to counsel Denethor, the secretly deranged Steward of Gondor; he also compared this uneasy alliance with the relationship he had with Gendo, as teacher and a student respectively.  
冬月瞥了一眼对面的书架，那儿大多是多年来收集的小说。他想起在船城打发时间时最喜欢的一部小说，那本厚重的《指环王》；那时孩子们正分崩离析，他有时会将自己比作试图劝诫疯狂的刚铎摄政王迪耐瑟的甘道夫；他也把这种不安的联盟关系比作自己与碇源堂之间的关系，一个是老师，一个是学生。

In his mind, Gendo was regressing like Denethor, consumed completely by his obsession, all the while forgetting his responsibility as a leader of a great scientific-military complex in threat of being assaulted by a powerful enemy. In response as a second-in-command, Fuyutsuki made it a personal obligation to resolve every NERV problem before they could overwhelm them in the end. He realized that in the long run, he could not stomach the idea of watching his subordinates die; he must take matters seriously as a leader, right in front, among the troops.  
在他看来，碇源堂正像迪耐瑟一样退化，完全被他的执念所吞噬，同时忘记了作为面临强大敌人威胁的伟大科学军事综合体领导者的责任。作为副手，冬月将解决每一个 NERV 的问题视为个人义务，以免最终被它们压垮。他意识到，从长远来看，他无法忍受看着下属死去；他必须像一个领导者一样，认真对待问题，站在队伍的最前方。

As for the question of Kaworu Nagisa, he hoped that somewhere in that Angel's heart, there might be a thin chance, however a human trait of conscience, to reconsider his plan to invade Terminal Dogma. He prayed that resolving it would not require violence and destruction on Misato's—and Shinji's—part, as with the case of previous Angel attacks.  
至于渚薰的问题，他希望在那位天使的心中，或许有一丝微乎其微的人类良知，能让他重新考虑入侵最终教条的计划。他祈祷解决此事不需要像之前天使袭击那样，由美里和真嗣采取暴力和破坏的手段。

Somewhere near the Eva cages, in a room shut off from the world, a bunch of men were gathered around a coffin-like tank placed on the floor. Presiding over this gathering was Director Hamamoto, along with four agents and Kasuga, the Eva crew chief, who was nervously sworn to secrecy.  
在靠近 Eva 笼子的某个封闭房间里，一群男人围着一个棺材般的储罐聚集在一起。主持这次集会的是滨本导演，还有四名特工和紧张得发誓保密的 Eva 机组组长春日。

"Are you sure this'll gonna work, sir?" Kasuga asked, highly doubtful. His hand was over a valve connected between a hose snaking into the tank, an isolation chamber, and a bigger stainless steel tank full of pressurized LCL. The tank was normally used for medical purposes to oxygenate patients, but for now its secondary purpose as a terrible interrogation device would be put into use.  
“先生，您确定这会奏效吗？”春日高度怀疑地问道。他的手放在一个阀门上，这个阀门连接着一条软管，软管一头通向储罐，另一头连接着一个隔离室和一个装满加压 LCL 的大不锈钢罐。这个罐子通常用于医疗目的，为病人供氧，但现在它的次要用途——一种可怕的审讯工具——将被启用。

"Don't tell everyone about this," Hamamoto answered, "but yes, I'm sure. I want to crack open this sonofabitch. It's taking me too long, along with his asshole buddies, so I hope this time we could get what we want."  
"别告诉所有人这件事，" 滨本回答，"但没错，我很确定。我想打开这个混蛋。他和他的那些混蛋同伙拖得太久了，所以我希望这次我们能得到我们想要的。"

He could see Swinton, still blindfolded, banging on the Plexiglas window, with one agent beside the tank, ignoring the prisoner's desperate pleas as he had a microphone suctioned to the window, ready to record everything onto his laptop computer.  
他可以看到斯温顿仍然蒙着眼睛，敲打着有机玻璃窗，旁边一个特工站在水箱旁，无视囚犯绝望的恳求，他将麦克风吸附在窗户上，准备将一切录音到他的笔记本电脑上。

"All right," Hamamoto said to Kasuga, nodding. "Give him the drink."  
"好吧，" 滨本对春日说，点头示意。"给他喝吧。"

Kasuga opened the valve and LCL was blasted into the tank, with Swinton being splashed inside, banging on the sides. He didn't expect that the old director would resort to this infamous tactic of "water-boarding".  
春日打开了阀门，LCL 液体猛地冲入水箱，斯温顿被溅得浑身湿透，在水中猛击着水箱壁。他没想到这位老导演会采用这种臭名昭著的“水刑”手段。

"You old nut! Get me out of here!" he screamed, before spitting out the blood-smelling liquid.  
“你这个老疯子！快放我出去！”他尖叫着，随后吐出了那股带有血腥味的液体。

"Tell me who bankrolled you," Hamamoto shot back. "Give me names!"  
“告诉我谁资助了你，”滨本反问道，“给我名字！”

"I told you I ain't giving anything!" Swinton spat.  
“我告诉过你，我什么都不会给的！”斯温顿啐道。

The old director shook his head. "Goddamn, I thought you have balls!" he exclaimed. "You call yourself Force Recon? C'mon!"  
老导演摇了摇头。“该死，我以为你有种！”他喊道。“你自称是特种侦察队的？得了吧！”

The tank was now halfway full, further causing Swinton to double his banging and yelling.  
坦克现在已经半满，这使得斯温顿更加用力地敲打和叫喊。

Hamamoto was relentless. "Names, places, dates! Tell me, you sonofabitch!" he raged.  
滨本毫不留情。“名字、地点、日期！告诉我，你这个混蛋！”他咆哮道。

"Screw you!" Swinton cursed, spitting. "You can't get anything from me!"  
“去你的！”斯温顿咒骂着，吐了口唾沫。“你从我这儿什么也得不到！”

"Talk, jarhead, or you'll be having more bloody orange juice than you could drink in a lifetime!"  
“说话，陆战队员，否则你喝的血橙汁会比一辈子能喝的还多！”

The LCL was now dangerously close to touching the window, threatening to drown the occupant, and suddenly Swinton finally cracked.  
LCL 液现在危险地接近触碰到窗户，威胁着要将里面的人淹没，突然间，斯温顿终于崩溃了。

"All right! All right! You win! I'll tell! I'LL SPEAK!" Swinton screamed.  
“好吧！好吧！你赢了！我说！我招供！”斯温顿尖叫道。

Hamamoto nodded to Kasuga to cut off the LCL flow, and he sighed. The audio recorder was still rolling, and the agent in control nodded in satisfaction. He was getting it all on file.  
滨本向春日示意切断 LCL 液的流动，他叹了口气。录音设备仍在运转，控制中的特工满意地点头。他正在将一切都记录在案。

"Now who gave you the order, bankrolled this kamikaze attack of yours, and the exact reason for it?" Hamamoto demanded.  
"现在谁给你下的命令，资助你这次自杀式袭击，以及确切的原因是什么？" 滨本质问道。

Swinton was breathing profusely, swallowing hard. "H… His name was Oda," he stuttered at first. "He called us up and told to capture this Langley girl. He also promised payment if we did, and as an extra, waste Major Katsuragi so that we could get a bonus."  
斯温顿气喘吁吁，艰难地吞咽着。"他…他的名字是织田，"他一开始结结巴巴地说道。"他打电话给我们，让我们抓住这个兰利女孩。他还承诺如果我们成功了就付钱，另外，如果能干掉胜木大佐，我们还能得到额外的奖金。"

Hamamoto frowned. "For what?"  
滨本皱起眉头。"为了什么？"

"He wanted her dead once he bags her… Shoot the girl himself!"  
"他一旦抓到她就想让她死……亲自开枪射杀那个女孩！"

The old Director's mind began to play the surname around like a Rolodex of personnel, trying to place it somewhere until he finally knew who Oda was. He looked at his subordinates and sighed resignedly.  
老局长的脑海中开始像翻阅人事档案一样转动着这个姓氏，试图将其定位，直到他终于想起奥田是谁。他看着下属们，无奈地叹了口气。

"We have now known the enemy," Hamamoto said at last, "and he's within our ranks. I need this Oda be bagged ASAP, and I want him alive!"  
"我们已经知道了敌人，"滨本最后说道，"他就在我们内部。我需要尽快抓住这个奥田，我要活的！"

Misato drove back to her flat, nearly inebriated, trying not to fall asleep on the wheel as she drove slowly at less than 40 kilometers per hour, despite the apparent treachery of the road ahead of her.  
美里开车回到她的公寓，几乎醉醺醺的，努力不让自己在方向盘上睡着，尽管前方的道路看似险恶，她还是以不到每小时 40 公里的速度缓慢行驶。

Once she parked the Alpine at her slot, Misato staggered out of the car and glanced at her wristwatch. It was 12:36 in the morning. _Oh, good,_ she thought, the woman taking out her jacket and the bag with her laptop and the disc inside, _I think I could still make it for a cup of coffee._  
当她把阿尔派停在自己的车位上后，美里踉跄着走出车外，看了一眼手腕上的手表。已经是凌晨 12 点 36 分了。哦，还好，她想着，从车里拿出外套和装有笔记本电脑及光盘的包，我想我还能赶上一杯咖啡。

Misato glanced up at the floor where her home was. Behind the curtains, there was the flicker of the television set still turned on. _Must be Kanzaki, watching TV,_ she guessed.  
美里抬头看向她家的楼层。在窗帘后面，电视机的闪烁依然亮着。一定是神崎在看电视，她猜测。

---

The killer, now positioned on the veranda and right on the floor above Misato's home, heard her park the car and slammed the door. As she walked towards the building, he unholstered his suppressed Beretta 92F and checked the weapon and its ammunition. He also felt for his supply of concussion grenades, attached to his belt.  
杀手此刻正站在阳台上，恰好位于美里家楼上的地板位置，他听到她停车并用力关上车门。当她走向建筑物时，他拔出了装有消音器的贝雷塔 92F，检查了武器及其弹药。他还摸了摸腰带上挂着的震撼弹。

Because of the evacuations following Unit-00's destruction, the whole block was now free of people, and Misato's flat was the only sign of human existence in a two-kilometer radius. This made it advantageous for the killer, who relied on stealth and speed, to rig the remote-detonation explosives to cut off the telephone and power lines supplying her flat.  
由于零号机被摧毁后的疏散行动，整个街区现已空无一人，美里的公寓成了两公里范围内唯一的人类存在迹象。这对依赖隐秘和速度的杀手来说颇为有利，他趁机在远程引爆的炸药上动手脚，切断了供应她公寓的电话和电源线路。

The killer now wore his night-vision goggles, mounted on his head and flipping them into his eyes, and held the electronic remote detonator, preparing for his one-man assault.  
杀手现在戴上了头戴式夜视仪，将其翻转到眼前，并手持电子遥控引爆器，准备展开他的单人突袭。

---

Misato walked to her front door and took out the keys from her pocket, but because Kanzaki was on guard, she pressed the doorbell instead.  
美里走到自家门前，从口袋里掏出钥匙，但因为神崎在警戒，她便改按了门铃。

"Who's it?" Tsutomo asked, speaking through the doorbell's intercom as he peered into the peephole.  
“谁啊？”堤问，通过门铃的对讲机说着，同时透过猫眼往外看。

"It's me," Misato answered. "Look, I'm only with myself."  
“是我，”美里回答，“看，我只有一个人。”

With one hand holding the Glock, Tsutomo opened the door and he was surprised to see Misato, almost flush with red as the woman took off her shoes.  
一手握着格洛克手枪，筒本打开了门，惊讶地看到美里站在门口，脸颊红得几乎要滴出血来，正脱下鞋子。

"Where have you been?" he asked, holstering the weapon back into his harness, relieved to see her back.  
“你去哪儿了？”他问道，将武器重新插回肩带，见到她回来感到一阵宽慰。

"Had a little drink down south," Misato answered. "The Sub-Commander asked for it."  
“在南边喝了点酒，”美里回答，“副司令要求的。”

"I see," he said, taking hold of her belongings as Misato hobbled to an empty chair at the table. There the woman wiped her face and sighed.  
"我明白了，"他说着，接过她的物品，而美里一瘸一拐地走向桌边的一张空椅子。她在那里擦了擦脸，叹了口气。

"I'll make some coffee," Tsutomo said as he went to the cupboard and took a pair of coffee mugs, before opening two packets of instant coffee and dumped them in along with hot water from the airpot.  
"我去冲点咖啡，"筒本说着走向橱柜，拿出两个咖啡杯，然后打开两包速溶咖啡，倒入杯中，再从热水瓶里倒进热水。

"Thanks," Misato said, shaking her head as she put her service pistol and cellular phone on the table.  
"谢谢，"美里说着，摇了摇头，将她的配枪和手机放在桌上。

Once they settled down with their hot java, Misato was the first to ask. "How's it going while I was gone?" she questioned before drinking.  
当他们坐定，手中握着热腾腾的咖啡时，Misato 首先开口问道：“我不在的时候一切还好吗？”她喝之前这样问道。

Tsutomo shrugged, before he set his weapon back on safety and tabled it. "Nothing eventful," he reported, "except maybe I heard Asuka talking in her sleep. 'Mama', she said."  
Tsutomo 耸了耸肩，然后将武器重新调至安全状态并搁置一旁。“没什么特别的事，”他报告说，“除了可能听到 Asuka 在睡梦中说话。她说‘妈妈’。”

Misato chuckled. "I've got some good news, partner," she said.  
Misato 轻声笑道：“我有个好消息，搭档，”她说。

Tsutomo cocked an eye at her. "What?"  
筒友挑起一只眼睛看着她。“什么？”

The woman took out from her pocket the box containing her new rank pins, and opened it. "The man promoted me to lieutenant colonel," she said.  
女人从口袋里拿出装有她新军衔徽章的盒子，并打开它。“那个男人提拔我为中校，”她说。

Tsutomo grinned, examining the pins under the light. "Well, damn," he drawled in awe. Congratulations, ma'am. Didn't know it. You should be celebrating right now."  
筒友咧嘴一笑，在灯光下审视着徽章。“好吧，该死，”他带着敬畏的语气拖长声音说。恭喜您，女士。之前不知道。你现在应该庆祝一下。”

"It'll be official tomorrow," Misato said as Tsutomo pushed the box back to her, before she pocketed the box.  
"明天就正式了，"美里说着，当津友把盒子推回给她时，她将盒子放进了口袋。

"On the other hand, there's some bad news," Tsutomo said. "The guy who discovered that Second Impact meteorite fifteen years ago was found dead. In Mexico City, of all places."  
"另一方面，有些坏消息，"津友说。"十五年前发现第二次冲击陨石的那个人被发现死亡了。在墨西哥城，真是意想不到的地方。

The woman was wide-eyed, her giddiness cut out. "What? The _Seymour Nunn_?"  
女人瞪大了眼睛，她的兴奋之情顿时消失。"什么？是西摩·纳恩吗？

"Yeah, it's over the news."  
"是啊，新闻都报道了。"

Misato scowled, having a sudden feel of the hairs on the back of her neck was stirring. "Isn't a coincidence?" she said aloud.  
美里皱起眉头，突然感觉到后颈的毛发在微微颤动。“这难道是巧合吗？”她大声说道。

"What did you say?" Tsutomo asked out of concern.  
"你说什么？" 筒友关切地问道。

"I am the _only_ Second Impact survivor, and that lying astronomer there laid claim to have discovered it before it hit Earth. I didn't believe his bullshit story for years, as I knew the truth, but now I'm suspecting that he was probably murdered before he could spill the beans."  
"我是第二次冲击唯一的幸存者，而那个撒谎的天文学家声称在它撞击地球前就发现了它。多年来我从未相信过他的鬼话，因为我知道真相，但现在我开始怀疑他可能在那之前就被谋杀了，没能揭露真相。"

"For what?" he asked before darkness unexpectedly came upon them. The electricity was out, and immediately they grabbed their pistols and ducked down, preparing for possible danger as they readied their weapons.  
"为什么？"他问道，随即黑暗突然降临。电力中断了，他们立刻抓起手枪蹲下，准备应对可能的危险，同时握紧了武器。"

"Shit," Misato cursed the blackout. "I think it's not over yet," she muttered.  
"该死，"美里咒骂着停电。"我觉得还没结束，"她低声说道。"

"Yeah," Tsutomo agreed, feeling for the little Surefire torch he had in his pocket, and pulled it out. "Okay, I'll try to get to the Children and keep an eye on them. You know what to do."  
“嗯，”筒友应道，摸索着口袋里的小型 Surefire 手电筒，并将其取出。“好，我会尽力接近孩子们并留意他们。你知道该怎么做。”

Suddenly the veranda glass panels were shattered, and they heard an object clattering on the floor. Instinctively Tsutomo yelled, "GRENADE!" and both went prone, covering their heads and ears with arms.  
突然，阳台的玻璃窗被击碎，他们听到一个物体在地板上叮当作响。筒友本能地大喊：“手榴弹！”两人随即卧倒，用双臂护住头部和耳朵。

An explosion of white light, accompanied by a loud bang, nearly blinded and rendered them almost deaf.  
一道刺眼的白光伴随着巨响爆炸开来，几乎让他们失明并暂时失聪。

---

A couple of minutes earlier, Shinji woke up to hear the front door being closed, and followed by the muffled sound of conversation going on, figuring that Misato had finally come home.  
几分钟前，真嗣醒来时听到前门被关上，随后是隐约的对话声，他猜想美里终于回家了。

Satisfied, he wrapped his arm upon Asuka's sleeping figure, and sighed. But before he could close his eyes, he suddenly heard a very loud bang coming from the living room. This startled him greatly.  
他满意地用胳膊搂住熟睡的明日香，叹了口气。但就在他闭上眼睛之前，突然听到客厅传来一声巨响，这让他大吃一惊。

"W… What's going on?" he loudly demanded, bolting up from the bed.  
“怎……怎么回事？”他大声质问，猛地从床上坐了起来。

The girl was also instantly awakened by the grenade. "Huh?" Asuka gasped.  
女孩也被手榴弹瞬间惊醒。“啊？”明日香倒吸一口气。

In the dim light they saw the bedroom door being slid open with a loud thud, and Tsutomo was standing right there with his weapon in right hand. The man was also smarting from the concussion grenade's after-effects.  
昏暗中，他们看到卧室门砰地一声被拉开，堤人正站在那里，右手握着武器。那人也因震撼弹的后效而感到不适。

"Kids! Better get to the other room!" he ordered, pointing towards the spare bedroom's open doors. "NOW!"  
“孩子们！快去另一个房间！”他命令道，指向备用卧室敞开的门。“现在！”

---

The killer jumped off the veranda's edge, landed on his feet, and immediately peered in with his NVG. He then whipped out his pistol and sought out Misato, who was lying prone on the floor, just behind the table, and fired.  
杀手从阳台边缘一跃而下，稳稳落地，随即戴上夜视仪向内窥视。他迅速拔出手枪，寻找着趴在桌后地板上的美里，并开火了。

But his first shots only hit the chair and table legs, disintegrating into splinters, and Misato quickly rolled to her right, ducking behind Pen-Pen's refrigerated home. He cursed, and the woman retaliated with her service pistol, forcing him to take cover.  
然而他的前几枪只击中了椅子和桌腿，碎片四溅，美里迅速向右翻滚，躲到了企鹅 Pen-Pen 的冷藏箱后。他咒骂一声，而美里则用她的配枪还击，迫使他寻找掩护。

Now he noticed that there was another set of sliding doors on the veranda, leading to the Children's bedroom. He went there and yanked the doors open, and then aimed right at where the kids were laying at.  
这时他注意到阳台上还有另一组通往儿童卧室的滑动门。他走过去猛地拉开，然后直接瞄准了孩子们躺着的地方。

Instead he was greeted by Tsutomo's Glock and a tactical flashlight shining into his eyes, and the agent blasted away with a couple of shots. The glass doors were blown out as the killer went for cover, mumbling more curses. He pulled off another flash-bang grenade and tossed it right into the bedroom, before it detonated.  
然而迎接他的却是津友本的格洛克手枪和一支战术手电筒照进他的眼睛，特工随即连开数枪。玻璃门被炸开，杀手一边咒骂着一边寻找掩护。他迅速掏出一枚闪光弹，扔进了卧室，随即引爆。

Again the killer went in, aimed the weapon through the tritium sights, trying to find his target. However, Tsutomo lunged at him from out of nowhere and his NVG was knocked off his head. Suddenly he was now blinded by the darkness, and the agent began to wrestle for his weapon. Struggling to keep his gun on-hand, he tried to fire, but the bullets perforated the ceiling above them, sprinkling them with paint and wood splinters.  
杀手再次冲入，透过氚光瞄准器寻找目标。然而，津友本突然从暗处扑向他，将他的夜视仪撞落。瞬间，他陷入了黑暗中，视线全无，两人开始争夺武器。在挣扎中，他试图开枪，但子弹却打穿了天花板，碎片和油漆屑纷纷落下。

Tsutomo kicked him in the groin, nearly incapacitating the killer and letting go of the gun. Not giving up, the killer pushed him off and whipped out a dagger from the back, then rushed at Tsutomo. But the agent sidestepped, grabbed the killer's right wrist, and delivered a punch and another to the ribs, before taking hold of the dagger and threw the killer to the wall, right into the bookshelf.  
津友本一脚踢向他的下体，几乎让杀手失去行动能力，手枪也脱手了。但杀手并未放弃，推开津友本，从背后抽出一把匕首，猛冲向他。但津友本侧身一闪，抓住杀手的右手腕，连续击打其腹部和肋骨，随后夺过匕首，将杀手摔向墙壁，正好撞上了书架。

The killer was now sprawled on the floor, and Tsutomo was about to deliver a hard kick, when he grabbed the agent's leg and tackled him down. On all fours, the killer got a choke hold on Tsutomo's throat, and dug his fingers hard in a bid to strangle the agent.  
杀手此刻正瘫倒在地，津友本想狠狠踢上一脚，却被对方抓住腿，顺势将其扑倒。杀手四肢着地，用锁喉的方式紧紧勒住津友的喉咙，手指用力深陷，试图将特工勒死。

However he heard a noise, looked up to see Misato swing a wooden chair at him, smashing it into his face and chest. By the sheer force of the impact, the killer was stunned, thrown off Tsutomo's chest, and landed on his back.  
然而他听到了声响，抬头一看，只见美里挥舞着木椅向他砸来，椅子重重击中他的脸和胸膛。巨大的冲击力让杀手瞬间失神，从津友的胸前被震开，仰面倒地。

"DON'T MOVE!" Misato yelled at the nearly-unconscious killer, aiming her gun, as Tsutomo went on his feet, walked up to the killer, rolled over and pinned him down face-first with arms to the back and a knee jabbed to the spine.  
“别动！”美里对着几乎昏迷的杀手大喊，举枪瞄准，与此同时津友站起身来，走到杀手身边，将其翻转过来，脸朝下按在地上，双臂反剪，膝盖顶住脊椎。

Breathing shallow for a moment, Tsutomo now tried to question the killer, whose face was bleeding. "Who the hell are you?" he demanded. "Who and what sent you here?"  
呼吸浅促了一瞬，堤文此刻试图质问那个脸上流血的杀手。“你到底是谁？”他厉声问道，“谁派你来的？”

The killer merely groaned instead. Frustrated, Tsutomo added more pressure on the killer's arms.  
杀手只是呻吟了一声。堤文感到沮丧，加大了按住杀手手臂的力度。

"C'mon, answer me! Who are you?"  
“快点，回答我！你是谁？”

"You wanna know?" the killer replied, gritting his teeth. "I'm supposed to kill her!"  
"你想知道吗？"杀手咬牙切齿地回答，"我应该杀了她！"

"WHO?" Tsutomo snapped. "谁？"筒友怒喝道。

"The girl!"

Still covering Tsutomo with her weapon, Misato now looked enraged. Just behind her, Shinji and Asuka were blinking, before it dawned upon the Second Children that she was the prime target, her initial revulsion and shock gave way to a quick upswell of anger.  
依旧用武器对准筒友，美里此刻显得怒不可遏。在她身后，真嗣和明日香眨了眨眼，随后第二适格者意识到她才是首要目标，最初的厌恶和震惊被迅速涌起的愤怒所取代。

"You…" Asuka mumbled, quickly turned cross and she was about to rush towards the killer when Shinji restrained her with his arms.  
"你…" 明日香咕哝着，迅速变得愤怒，正要冲向那个杀手时，真嗣用双臂拦住了她。

"No!" he blurted.

"I want to kill that bastard myself!" Asuka yelled, struggling against Shinji. "I THINK HE KILLED KAJI!"  
"我要亲手宰了那个混蛋！" 明日香大喊，挣扎着对抗真嗣。"我觉得他杀了加持！"

"Let them keep him down!" Shinji countered. "He's still dangerous!"  
"让他们制住他！" 真嗣反驳道。"他还是很危险！"

But Asuka was boiling with fury, even as Shinji held her at bay.  
但明日香怒火中烧，即便真嗣试图阻止她。

"I need something to tie this sonofabitch," Tsutomo ordered, and Misato immediately went to her room. In there she bent down to open her toolbox, picked up a roll of duct tape and returned to the Children's room. She then handed the roll to Tsutomo, who was still keeping the pressure on the killer, and the agent went about binding the tape on the killer's wrists and feet. Once done, Tsutomo rolled the killer onto his back.  
“我需要东西来捆住这个混蛋，”堤文命令道，美里立刻去了她的房间。她在里面弯腰打开工具箱，拿起一卷胶带，然后回到孩子们的房间。她将胶带递给仍在压制杀手的堤文，这位特工便开始用胶带捆绑杀手的双手和双脚。完成后，堤文将杀手翻了个身，让他仰面朝天。

"All right," Tsutomo said. "What's your name?" he demanded.  
“好吧，”堤文说。“你叫什么名字？”他质问道。

"It's not of your concern, dipshit!" the killer shot back, and spat at Tsutomo's face. The agent winced for a second before wiping his face with a free hand.  
"这与你无关，蠢货！" 杀手回敬道，朝津友的脸吐了口唾沫。特工皱了皱眉，随即用空着的手擦了擦脸。

"Who sent you here?"  
"谁派你来的？"

"I'll not say!" "我不会说的！"

Grim-faced, Tsutomo nodded to Misato, as if asking her to take a turn in questioning the killer. She then pointed her weapon close enough to the killer's head.  
面色阴沉的筒本向美里点头示意，仿佛在请她接手审问这个杀手。随后，她将武器指向了杀手的头部，距离近得足以令人胆寒。

"For whom you're working for? The government, the UN, the Committee? Who?" she asked loudly, but the killer said nothing. Incensed, Misato grabbed the killer by the collar and dragged him across the bedroom and out onto the veranda. There, with all of her strength, pulled up the killer onto a chair, pinned him with her weight and choked his neck right on the veranda's railing. As she did, Tsutomo pulled out his cellular phone and began calling up his boss.  
“你为谁工作？政府、联合国、委员会？是谁？”她大声质问，但杀手一言不发。愤怒之下，美里抓住杀手的衣领，将他拖过卧室，拽到了阳台上。在那里，她用尽全力将杀手拽上椅子，用体重压制住他，并在阳台栏杆上紧紧勒住他的脖子。与此同时，筒本掏出手机，开始联系他的上司。

"Are you the one who's with those trying to kill us? Who sent you? Did you kill Kaji?" Misato questioned.  
“你是那些试图杀我们的人中的一员吗？谁派你来的？你杀了加持吗？”美里追问道。

The killer merely squirmed, not uttering a word.  
杀手只是蠕动着，一言不发。

"Goddamnit, ANSWER ME!" Misato raged, tears coming from her eyes.  
“该死的，回答我！”美里怒吼着，泪水从她的眼中涌出。

The killer snorted. "For an agent, he was such a philosophical fool!" he muttered, loud enough for everyone to hear. Misato slapped him right across the face, and then jammed the pistol's barrel on the killer's temple.  
杀手嗤之以鼻。“身为特工，他竟如此哲学般的愚蠢！”他喃喃自语，声音大到所有人都能听见。美里狠狠地扇了他一巴掌，然后将手枪的枪管顶在了杀手的太阳穴上。

"Now, I ask you for the last time," Misato said, fury laced in her voice. "Who sent you here to do your bloody work? WHO!"  
"现在，我最后一次问你，" 美里说道，声音中夹杂着愤怒。"是谁派你来执行这该死的工作的？谁！"

Strangely, the killer relaxed himself. "You know, I'm a mere instrument, and there's a higher power that's all behind this. You'll never win this time and…"  
奇怪的是，杀手放松了自己。"你知道，我只是一个工具，背后有更高权力在操控这一切。这次你永远不会赢，而且……"

The killer clenched his jaw harder and in a few seconds he began to convulse. Misato suddenly let go and backed away, as she knew by the smell of burnt almonds what poison the killer used to end his life. The two Children were shocked, and Tsutomo looked angry, feeling cheated.  
杀手咬紧牙关，几秒钟后开始抽搐。美里突然松手后退，她从烧焦的杏仁味中知道杀手用什么毒药结束了自己的生命。两个孩子震惊了，筒本看起来很生气，感觉被欺骗了。

Once the killer was finally silent and slumped on the chair, Misato hung her head and whispered, "The bastard just bit on some cyanide."  
当凶手终于沉默并瘫坐在椅子上时，美里低下头，低声说道：“这个混蛋咬了氰化物。”

Misato slowly walked back into the bedroom, went down onto her knees and wept, angrily pounding her fist on the floor, almost quietly cursing before she was joined by Asuka, who likewise cried onto her shoulder as she hugged her guardian. As they watched both women sob, Tsutomo and Shinji felt defeated. Even if it was too late to be able to get some answers, they finally found Kaji's murderer.  
美里缓缓走回卧室，跪下哭泣，愤怒地用拳头捶打着地板，几乎低声咒骂着，直到明日香也加入了她，同样在她肩头哭泣并拥抱她的守护者。看着两位女士哭泣，筒本和真嗣感到沮丧。尽管已经太迟无法得到答案，但他们终于找到了杀害加持的凶手。

After he finished recording his video message, Kaworu picked up a blank CD from a spindle and inserted it into the computer's DVD drive. He then burned the finished video clip to disc, and afterwards he picked up a marker and wrote down the kanji for the name of his recipient on the burned disc, before putting it into an envelope.  
录制完视频信息后，渚薰从一叠空白 CD 中拿起一张，插入电脑的 DVD 驱动器。然后他将录制好的视频片段刻录到光盘上，随后拿起一支马克笔，在刻录好的光盘上写下收件人的名字，最后将其放入信封中。

Once the task was over, Kaworu turned off the computer and the desk lamp, and lay down on his bed. There was a new day ahead of him, even if the three remaining days could also be his last.  
任务结束后，渚薰关掉了电脑和台灯，躺在了床上。新的一天等待着他，即便剩下的三天也可能是他的最后时光。

He hope they would soon understand his purpose for being here.  
他希望他们能尽快理解他来到这里的目的。

**Author's Notes:** It's short, but otherwise important. Writing this took just about two nights, while battling a toothache in the wisdom tooth.  
作者笔记：虽然简短，但至关重要。写这篇作品只花了大约两个晚上，期间还在与智齿引起的牙痛作斗争。

Hmmmm… anyway, I read some of the older fics I had in my collection, trying to see if they could size up. These days since Chapter 9+=*, and after analyzing someone else's fics, here's my rule of thumb: try to maintain the balance between dialogue and description, but don't try to embellish too much description for every line of dialogue; it's like putting them into a straitjacket.  
嗯……总之，我翻阅了一些收藏中的旧同人文，试图看看它们是否能经得起考验。如今随着Chapter 9+=*的流行，以及分析了其他人的作品后，我的经验法则是：尽量保持对话与描述之间的平衡，但不要每句对话都过度修饰描述；这就像给它们套上了紧身衣。

### Chapter 22 Before Daybreak  
Chapter 22 破晓之前

Down at the Geofront, in the Section Two Annex building, Keith Sanderson was busy at his cubicle, feeding sheets of paper into a shredder, trying to destroy some of his work while his computer was running a wipe program to destroy any digitized documents and other information in the hard drive. He was doing all this to cover his tracks before the whole NERV security apparatus could nab him.  
在 Geofront 的第二分部附属建筑内，基思·桑德森正忙于他的小隔间，将一叠叠纸张送入碎纸机，试图销毁他的部分工作，同时他的电脑正在运行一个擦除程序，以销毁硬盘中的任何数字化文档和其他信息。他这样做是为了在 NERV 整个安全系统抓住他之前掩盖自己的踪迹。

He was mad at Oda for going ahead, when it would've been easier to just wait for Asuka and take her out of the picture. But Oda was under pressure, and that killer's non-cooperation had hurt him. Now it was up to Sanderson to do the job alone, and if necessary, attempt to sabotage the rest of the entire facility.  
他对 Oda 擅自行动感到愤怒，明明等待 Asuka 然后让她出局会更简单。但 Oda 承受着压力，那个杀手的拒不合作也伤害了他。现在，这项任务落到了 Sanderson 一个人身上，如有必要，他甚至得尝试破坏整个设施的其余部分。

Years ago, Tsutomo's father once told him that revenge was a double-edged sword, and always came with a price (apart from the oft-quoted advice about digging two graves for vengeance): _eye for an eye may sound right, but hatred makes the avenger blind_  
多年前，Tsutomo 的父亲曾告诉他，复仇是一把双刃剑，总是伴随着代价（除了那句常被引用的关于为复仇挖两个坟的忠告）：以眼还眼听起来或许没错，但仇恨会让复仇者盲目。

.

He'd remember that adage well, dispensing it whenever someone hunger for vengeance, to use a wrong to correct another wrong. But really, it required a strong degree of restraint and common sense not to fall into the revenge trap.  
他会牢记那句格言，每当有人渴望复仇，试图以恶制恶时，他便会引用它。但实际上，这需要极大的克制力和常识，以免陷入复仇的陷阱。

With what's left of his coffee in the mug, Tsutomo took a sip and sighed, as he watched the killer's corpse being zipped up, laid on a stretcher and taken away by the coroners. Director Hamamoto and his Section Two suits occupied Misato's flat, cordoning off the premises with crime-scene tape. There, agents in white forensic suits went around taking pictures, gathering and bagging evidence, and recording every detail while working under battery-powered spotlight rigs. Misato had also commandeered a vacated flat (abandoned, really, after Unit-00 obliterated much of the city, forcing carpenters to drop the repair work) next door, and turned it into a temporary workspace for the Section Two investigators.  
Tsutomo 端起杯子，喝了一口剩下的咖啡，叹了口气，看着凶手的尸体被拉上拉链，放在担架上，由验尸官抬走。Hamamoto 局长和他的第二科西装团队占据了 Misato 的公寓，用犯罪现场封锁带围住现场。在那里，身穿白色法医服的特工们四处拍照，收集并打包证据，在电池供电的聚光灯下记录每一个细节。Misato 还征用了一间空置的公寓（实际上是被废弃的，因为 Unit-00 摧毁了城市的大部分，迫使木匠们放弃了修复工作）作为隔壁的临时工作区，供第二科的调查人员使用。

For now and in that room, the woman was sitting on a stool, nursing her leftover mug of coffee, staring distantly, somber, and deep in thought. Meanwhile Shinji and Asuka were also seated, yet anxiously waiting. The whole room was itself unfinished, still painted on with primer and some scaffolding draped in clear protective plastic, and at the far corner there were unopened cans of paint. On top of a work table was an LED lamp, flooding the room with white light.  
此刻，在那间屋子里，女人正坐在凳子上，啜饮着剩余的咖啡，目光遥远而沉郁，陷入深深的思索。与此同时，真嗣和明日香也坐在一旁，焦急地等待着。整个房间尚未完工，墙壁上还残留着底漆，几处脚手架被透明的防护塑料布覆盖，远处的角落里堆放着未开封的油漆罐。工作台上，一盏 LED 灯洒下耀眼的白光，照亮了整个空间。

After both adults were checked over by a pair of paramedics, Director Hamamoto told Misato and Tsutomo of the killer's purported identity, an Eiji Oda, who was actually part of Section Two's surveillance apparatus, working as a double agent inside the Japanese government with the suppose mission of providing intelligence for NERV. The old man added that the agent was a former North Korean intelligence operative during the Second Korean War, switched sides to the United Nations, became a naturalized Japanese citizen, before two years ago he was loaned over to NERV for his expert services. The director admitted that in order to unravel the killer's identity, they had to resort to unethical methods on one of the IR terrorists. He did not, however, elaborated on those interrogation methods.  
在两名医护人员检查完两位成年人后，Hamamoto 局长向 Misato 和 Tsutomo 透露了凶手的身份，一个名叫 Eiji Oda 的人，实际上是第二课的监视机构成员，作为双重间谍潜伏在日本政府内部，据称任务是为 NERV 提供情报。这位老人补充说，该特工在第二次朝鲜战争期间曾是朝鲜的情报人员，后转投联合国，成为日本归化公民，两年前被借调到 NERV 以发挥其专业技能。局长承认，为了揭开凶手的身份，他们不得不对一名 IR 恐怖分子采取了不道德的手段。但他并未详细说明这些审讯方法。

Misato then said that although she was thankful for that information, she admitted frustration for not able to take Oda alive. She asked if this Oda really worked with Kaji, and Hamamoto said they did on several occasions in the field as operatives, trying to keep tabs on their opposite numbers in the UN and the Japanese government.  
Misato 随后表示，尽管她对这些信息表示感谢，但她承认未能活捉 Oda 让她感到沮丧。她询问 Oda 是否真的与 Kaji 合作过，Hamamoto 回答说他们在现场作为特工多次合作，试图监视联合国和日本政府中的对手。

In Misato's case, the chance of consummating her revenge was thwarted, her lover's murderer cheating by poisoning himself. God knows what secrets the killer had in his brain, and this knowledge could possibly be encompassing, innumerable and explosive. So many questions yet remained unanswered, with the killer silently carrying his riddles all too soon to the crematorium.  
在美里的事例中，她复仇的机会被挫败了，她爱人的凶手通过自我下毒作弊。天知道凶手脑子里藏着什么秘密，这些知识可能是包罗万象、不计其数且极具爆炸性的。还有那么多问题尚未得到解答，而凶手却很快就要带着这些谜团默默走向火葬场。

Now Tsutomo wondered if, after all violence directed against them in the last 24 hours, they could still make a dead man speak. There was still the worrisome prospect of more moles in the system.  
如今，堤文雄想知道，在过去的 24 小时里他们遭受了所有的暴力之后，他们是否还能让一个死人开口。系统中仍有可能存在更多鼹鼠的前景令人担忧。

"Who the hell sent him here?" Asuka asked, breaking the silence between them. She was referring to her would-be murderer.  
“到底是谁派他来的？”明日香问道，打破了他们之间的沉默。她指的是她的潜在杀手。

Shinji frowned a bit, as it was probably the umpteenth time Asuka was trying. "That's the same question I'm always asking myself," the boy said. "Not until we finally get the answers."  
真嗣微微皱眉，这大概是明日香尝试的第无数次了。“这也是我一直在问自己的问题，”男孩说道，“直到我们最终找到答案。”

"Ah, okay," Asuka agreed. "I'm sick of being chased by someone trying to kill me with a reason I don't damn know."  
“啊，好吧，”明日香同意道，“我受够了被一个我他妈都不知道原因的人追杀。”

"Whatever… I still have to protect you, no matter how."  
“不管怎样……我仍然得保护你，无论如何。”

"You sound corny. I can handle it," Asuka said. "I'll shoot again if necessary, just like yesterday."  
“你听起来挺老套的。我能应付，”明日香说，“如果有必要，我会像昨天那样再次射击。”

Shinji shook his head. "No way, you can't do this alone. It's my… No, it's our responsibility to keep you safe. Gonna have to stick along with you."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不行，你不能独自行动。这是我的……不，是我们的责任，要确保你的安全。我得一直跟着你。”

Asuka sighed. "But I still have the right to defend myself if _you_ go down, Invincible Shinji. Remember that, and I'm still stubborn as ever."  
明日香叹了口气。“但如果你倒下了，我仍有权自卫，无敌的真嗣。记住这一点，我还是一如既往地固执。”

Shinji groaned, giving up. "Never mind."  
真嗣叹了口气，放弃了。"算了。"

Suddenly, Director Hamamoto walked in, prompting Misato, Tsutomo and both Children to rise from their seats.  
突然，滨本导演走了进来，这让美里、堤摩和两个孩子都从座位上站了起来。

"What's up, Director?" Misato queried.  
"怎么了，导演？"美里问道。

"Although we can't find anything on your man, one of my agents found a suspicious van downstairs, just a hundred meters away from here," the old man said. "They also found the transformer blown with explosives, which explains for this blackout on your block."  
"尽管我们无法在你的人身上找到任何线索，但我的一个特工在楼下发现了一辆可疑的货车，距离这里仅一百米远，"老人说道。"他们还发现变压器被炸毁了，这解释了你所在街区停电的原因。"

"And…?"

Hamamoto sighed. "After they managed to break open the van, looks like he forgot to destroy his cellular phone and computer in there, so good for us, bad for him. I asked my men that they must be checked over for any possible leads we could find, to follow where and who's his real employers."  
滨本叹了口气。"在他们设法打开货车后，看来他忘了销毁里面的手机和电脑，这对我们来说是好事，对他则是坏事。我要求我的手下必须仔细检查，寻找任何可能的线索，追踪他的真正雇主是谁。"

"How long it would take?"  
"需要多长时间？"

"Not sure, but since this Oda worked with classified information, we'll have to decode whatever secrets he have in his hard drive and memory. Wouldn't take much once we bring them down to the lab for further analysis, where we have the necessary tools."  
"不确定，但既然这个 Oda 处理过机密信息，我们得解码他硬盘和记忆中的所有秘密。一旦把它们带到实验室进行进一步分析，就不会花太多时间，那里我们有必要的工具。"

Misato nodded. "I see."  
美里点头。"我明白了。"

"Anyway, Major…" Hamamoto trailed.  
"无论如何，少校……" 滨本话音渐弱。"

"The Sub-Commander promoted me to Lieutenant Colonel this evening, sir," Misato corrected him.  
“副司令今晚将我晋升为中校，长官，”美里纠正他。

Hamamoto cleared his throat. "I mean, Colonel, while we finish cleaning up here, I recommend that for the duration of this emergency, and for your own safety, you and the Children will have to vacate these premises, go down to Headquarters and get some sleep at the BOQ, so bring anything you deem as necessary. It's the most secure place we still have."  
滨本清了清喉咙。“我是说，上校，在我们完成这里的清理工作期间，我建议在这次紧急情况下，为了您的安全，您和孩子们必须撤离这些场所，前往总部并在军官宿舍休息，带上您认为必要的任何东西。这是我们目前最安全的地方。”

The old director now turned his attention to Asuka, from his pocket he brought out what looked like a small spray can, and handed it to the girl.  
老主任现在转向明日香，他从口袋里拿出一个看起来像小喷雾罐的东西，递给了女孩。

"This here, young lady," Hamamoto said, "is a can of Mace. Keep it, and use it just in case. Should some punk get you in trouble, aim and blast it at the punk's face."  
"这东西，小姑娘，" 哈马莫托说道，"是一罐催泪喷雾。拿着它，必要时就用。如果有混混找你麻烦，瞄准他的脸喷过去。"

Asuka nodded, as she shook the can and read the label. "Okay, sir. Thanks."  
明日香点点头，摇了摇罐子并阅读标签。"好的，先生。谢谢。"

"Good," the old man approved, before focusing on Misato and Tsutomo. "Now I'll have to order everyone at the checkpoints to double-check every damn vehicle passing by and coming in and out of the base. This time I don't want to have this incident and yesterday repeated again."  
"很好，"老人表示赞同，随后转向美里和筒本。"现在我得命令所有检查站的守卫，对每一辆进出基地的车辆都进行双重检查。这次我不想再让昨天的事件重演了。"

The twelve monoliths were once again present, an emergency meeting in progress. Behind his own monolith, Keel was seething with fury, having seen the efforts of one of his agents come to failure. All was left was a pair of cards in his sleeve, ready for another move on the poker table, and Keel had also invested a huge stack of chips in the middle of the table.  
十二座巨碑再次矗立，一场紧急会议正在进行。在自己的巨碑后，基尔怒火中烧，目睹了自己一名特工的努力化为泡影。他袖中仅剩一对牌，准备在扑克桌上再下一城，而基尔也在桌中央押上了巨额筹码。

SEELE 06 was the first to inquire. "What is the purpose of this meeting?"  
Seele 06 首先发问。“这次会议的目的是什么？”

"One of our executive agents is dead, and what we need is to look into other options," SEELE 01 responded.  
“我们的一名执行特工已死，现在需要考虑其他方案。”Seele 01 回应道。

"Any options we wish to use?" SEELE 09 asked.  
“我们希望使用哪些选项？” SEELE 09 问道。

"Yes," SEELE 01 answered. "Apart from our Angel, we still have one agent left inside to do anything he must to accomplish his objective. It is unfortunate that our executive agent on the outside has not cooperated properly with our mole. Worse, he acted too rashly."  
“是的，”SEELE 01 回答道，“除了我们的使徒，我们还有一名特工留在内部，执行他必须完成的任务。遗憾的是，我们外部的执行特工未能与我们的内应妥善合作。更糟糕的是，他行动过于鲁莽。”

"Yet on NERV's side there were casualties in that convoy," SEELE 05 added. "Judging from their reaction capability, they were insufficiently trained and armed to stop their attackers. That would make our job easier once the day comes."  
“然而，在 NERV 那边，那支车队出现了伤亡，”SEELE 05 补充道，“从他们的反应能力来看，他们训练不足，装备也不足以阻止攻击者。一旦时机成熟，这将使我们的任务变得更容易。”

"There will be no question that soon Colonel Quaritch's men, in their small numbers and excellent training, can easily overpower NERV's security forces." SEELE 03 remarked.  
“毫无疑问，很快奎利奇上校的少数精锐部队就能轻易压制 NERV 的安保力量。” SEELE 03 评论道。

"Don't be so sure, gentlemen," SEELE 04 sighed. "There is a problem, though."  
“别那么肯定，先生们，” SEELE 04 叹了口气，“不过，确实有个问题。”

SEELE 01 coughed, a bit surprised. "What is it, then?"  
SEELE 01 轻咳一声，略感惊讶。“那是什么问题呢？”

"According to some recent satellite photoreconnaissance results," SEELE 04 reported, "there appeared to be some significant activity going on at their supply yard, with the arrival of several shipping containers of unknown content."  
"根据最近的卫星侦察照片显示，" SEELE 04 报告说，"他们的供应场似乎有一些重大活动，有几个装有未知内容的集装箱抵达。"

"Show us your proof," SEELE 01 said.  
"展示你们的证据，" SEELE 01 说道。"

Several pictures materialized from out of nowhere, hovering before the monoliths. They were all satellite photos of NERV's supply yard at Sengokuhara, north of what used to be Tokyo-3. Below the foothills in the north, a set of rails ran from west to east, and south of that was a large complex of warehouses and to the right was a cluster of container vans. In the middle of the photo was what appeared to be a pair of forklifts hauling their load from a freight train onto trucks, while cluster of men surrounded the vehicles; some of these men were armed.  
几张照片凭空出现，悬浮在巨石之前。它们都是 NERV 在仙石原的供应场的卫星照片，位于曾经是第三新东京市的北部。在北部的山脚下，一组铁轨从西延伸到东，南面是一个大型仓库群，右侧是一排集装箱货车。照片中央似乎有两辆叉车正从货运火车上将货物转移到卡车上，一群人围在车辆周围；其中一些人携带武器。

"That is not looking good," SEELE 01 muttered. "When those photos were taken?"  
"情况看起来不妙，" SEELE 01 喃喃自语。"这些照片是什么时候拍的？"

"Just yesterday," SEELE 04 said. "At the same time while the assault on the convoy took place."  
"就在昨天，" SEELE 04 说。"就在袭击车队的同时。"

Behind his monolith, Keel clenched his jaw. He couldn't believe it, realizing what was going on… and he banged his fist on the desk. The whole ruse made sense.  
在他身后的巨石旁，基尔紧咬牙关。他难以置信地意识到正在发生的事情……他一拳砸在桌子上。整个骗局终于说得通了。

"The convoy was a diversion," SEELE 01 said aloud. "They used her as _bait!_"  
"这支车队是个幌子，" SEELE 01 大声说道，"他们把她当作诱饵！"

Immediately the other monoliths were whispering, muttering in disbelief.  
立刻，其他石碑开始窃窃私语，难以置信地低声议论。

"Do you wish to have our agent on the ground to find out what's inside those containers?" SEELE 04 quickly recommended.  
"您希望我们的地面特工去查明那些集装箱里有什么吗？" SEELE 04 迅速建议道。"

"It must be done," SEELE 01 answered, trying to contain his anger. "Their parcel could be anything. In reaction to this unusual activity, does anyone wish to proceed to the next step?"  
"必须完成，" SEELE 01 回答，试图压抑他的愤怒。"他们的包裹可能是任何东西。面对这种异常活动，有人希望进行下一步吗？"

Eleven other "ayes" rang out before him.  
在他面前响起了十一个"同意"的声音。

"I want him to look into that immediately," SEELE 01 ordered. "Of course, it is necessary that the Second Children must be eliminated immediately; if she successfully takes hold of Unit Two again, it would complicate our efforts. We need to remove any obstacles in preparation for the awaited day; we must force that Third Children ready by weakening his will and morale, make him submit, and that is what our Angel should do!"  
"我要他立即调查此事，" SEELE 01 命令道。"当然，必须立即消灭第二适格者；如果她再次成功控制二号机，将使我们的努力复杂化。我们需要为期待已久的那一天扫清障碍；我们必须通过削弱他的意志和士气，迫使那个第三适格者准备好，让他屈服，这才是我们的使徒应该做的！"

"Why don't we ask our agent to monitor him, should he does something that is _not_ in our plan?" SEELE 06 suggested. "Frankly, he's still a wild card even if he's been in your care for years."  
“我们为何不让特工监视他，以防他做出不在我们计划内的事？”SEELE 06 提议道。“坦白说，即便他在你手下多年，仍是个不可控因素。”

"Make that happen as well," SEELE 01 agreed. "If that Angel defies our directives, expose and turn him over to his death in the hands of Unit One to fulfill the prophecies, and if we find out that Ikari or any of his subordinates are trying to outsmart us, then we will advance the clock and throw anything we have at them."  
“就这么办，”SEELE 01 同意道。“若那使徒违抗我们的指令，就揭露并交由第一部队处决，以应验预言；若发现碇或其下属试图耍弄我们，那就提前行动，动用一切手段对付他们。”

While Misato and the two Children were back in their flat, busy packing their bags and preparing to leave, Hamamoto, Tsutomo and a field agent were hunched over Oda's laptop, now placed on the work table and turned on. Presented on the laptop's display was the login screen, customized with the picture of the killer's favorite AV idol, scanned from a porn magazine, her name printed over the navel; she was half-naked, wearing only the top of a sailor-style school uniform, her huge bust size threatening to rip open that thin garment, and that was all.  
当美里和两个孩子回到公寓，忙着打包行李准备离开时，滨本、堤摩和一名现场特工正围在奥田的笔记本电脑前，电脑已放置在工作台上并开机。屏幕上显示着登录界面，背景是凶手最喜爱的 AV 偶像照片，从一本色情杂志扫描而来，她的名字印在肚脐上方；她半裸着，仅穿着水手服样式的上衣，巨大的胸部似乎要将那薄薄的衣料撑破，仅此而已。

Hamamoto shook his head. "That sex-crazed prick," he muttered. "Got any clue what that dick could use as a password?"  
滨本摇了摇头。“那个色情狂混蛋，”他低声咒骂。“你知道那家伙可能会用什么作为密码吗？”

Tsutomo shrugged. "Dunno, sir," he doubted.

The agent working on the laptop frowned. "This guy's obviously using Linux, sir, and unless we decode his hard drive I'm not sure what flavor he'd installed on this machine. Assuming that he's an advanced user… Hell, no, a _hardcore hacker_, I think he might have installed an encryption program to make sure no one could use it, and if we entered the wrong password, we could run the risk of destroying whatever's inside the hard drive. However, we're lucky there's no fingerprint scanner on this machine."  
操作笔记本电脑的特工皱起眉头。“这家伙显然在使用 Linux 系统，长官，除非我们解码他的硬盘，否则我不确定他在这台机器上安装了哪种版本。假设他是一个高级用户……见鬼，不，是个硬核黑客，我想他可能安装了加密程序以确保没人能使用它，如果我们输入错误的密码，可能会冒着破坏硬盘内所有数据的风险。不过，幸运的是这台机器上没有指纹扫描器。”

"Looks like we're really up to a real bad boy," Tsutomo remarked.  
“看来我们真的遇到了一个真正的坏家伙，”堤文说。

The old director sighed. "Tell you what, son," he said to the young agent. "If you're not sure, we'll bring this to Doctor Akagi. She's the only one, in my book, with more experience working with computers than any of us, and even her subordinates. Heck, if she could power the MAGI with even a car battery, I'm sure she could also deal with this little number. We'll ask Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki to pull the necessary strings. Now, what about the phone?"  
老局长叹了口气。“告诉你，孩子，”他对年轻的特工说，“如果你不确定，我们就把这个交给赤木博士。在我看来，她是唯一一个在计算机操作方面比我们任何人都更有经验的人，甚至包括她的下属。天哪，如果她能用一块汽车电池驱动 MAGI，我相信她也能处理这个小问题。我们会请副指挥官冬月拉一下必要的线。现在，电话怎么办？”

Oda's phone was now connected to the field agent's laptop with a data cable. The good news was that they were able to read off the phone's address book, crammed with hundreds of numbers; however, most of the numbers may not be traceable at all.  
织田的手机现在通过数据线连接到了现场特工的笔记本电脑上。好消息是他们能够读取手机通讯录中的数百个号码；然而，这些号码中的大部分可能根本无法追踪。

"It'll take some time to trace all of them," the field agent said. "Some of them are either belonging to pay phones, or calls made from elsewhere. Worse, his callers maybe using some sort of a relay network to lose the tracers."  
“追踪所有这些号码需要一些时间，”现场特工说，“其中一些要么属于投币电话，要么是从其他地方打来的。更糟糕的是，他的来电者可能使用某种中继网络来摆脱追踪者。”

"Okay," Hamamoto said to Tsutomo, and gestured at the phone and the laptop. "You take these down to the lab, and then scan the phone, but if we can't open that laptop, it'll be up to Doctor Akagi to help us crack the hard drive. Otherwise the last thing we needed is to be peering into someone's gun barrel."  
“好的，”羽本木对津友说，并指了指手机和笔记本电脑。“你把这些带到实验室去，然后扫描手机，但如果我们打不开那台笔记本，就得靠赤城博士帮我们破解硬盘了。否则我们最不需要的就是被人用枪口盯着。”

---

Afterwards, with Director Hamamoto insisting that he would follow them later, they were now heading towards the car train station, in two vehicles, to go down to the 'Front. Riding with Asuka in one of them, an armored Chevrolet Suburban, Shinji looked out at the Hakone night scene, wondering. The back of the SUV was filled with most of their baggage, including a big cooler containing Misato's treasured stash of Yebisu, two cases worth of the brew covered in ice cubes. Following them a few meters from the SUV's rear, Misato was behind the wheel in her Renault Alpine.  
之后，尽管羽本木主任坚持他会稍后跟上，他们现在正前往汽车火车站，分乘两辆车，前往‘前线’。与明日香同乘一辆装甲雪佛兰郊区车，真嗣望着箱根的夜色，陷入沉思。SUV 的后部装满了大部分行李，包括一个装有美里珍藏的惠比寿啤酒的大冷却器，两箱啤酒被冰块覆盖。在他们 SUV 后方几米处，美里驾驶着她的雷诺阿尔派。

He remembered the final words of Kaji's murderer.  
他记得凶手加治的最后一句话。

"_You know, I'm a mere instrument, and there's a higher power that's all behind this…"_  
"你知道，我只是个工具，这一切背后有更高的力量在操控…"

A higher power… who or what was it? He didn't know, but perhaps Misato could fill him in the details later.  
更高的力量…那是什么或谁？他不知道，但或许美里稍后能告诉他详情。

Just then Asuka rest her head upon his left shoulder, still asleep. Shinji nodded; it was okay. He then glanced at the road ahead of them, with Tsutomo doing the driving alongside an agent.  
就在这时，明日香把头靠在他的左肩上，依然睡着。真嗣点点头；没关系。然后他看向前方的道路，堤人正在和一名特工一起驾驶。

Now he wondered why would someone wanted to kill Asuka. Apparently she was too important to those killers, their reasons still largely unknown to him. Was she an irritant, a thorn on their side? Is the attempt on her life part of a bigger, sinister plan? Now, considering that they were Eva pilots, responsible for commandeering the most powerful weapons in existence, it comes to no surprise that someone out there, with immense influence, wanted them dead.  
现在他疑惑为何有人想要杀掉明日香。显然她对那些杀手来说太过重要，他们的动机对他仍大多未知。她是他们的眼中钉，肉中刺吗？对她生命的企图是否是某个更大、更阴险计划的一部分？如今，考虑到他们是 EVA 驾驶员，负责操控现存最强大的武器，有人——拥有巨大影响力的人——想要他们死，这并不令人意外。

Shinji then thought of Kaworu's motives. Exactly what was he doing here? Is it because he was lonely that they—whoever they were—sent him to become his friend and an ally? Or because of his unknown origins he could be under suspicion? An enemy?  
真嗣随后思考起渚薰的动机。他究竟为何来到这里？是因为孤独，那些人——无论他们是谁——派他来成为他的朋友和盟友？还是因为他的未知出身，他可能受到怀疑？是个敌人？

It was unthinkable. Since he arrived, Kaworu proved himself to be trustworthy, a peacemaker like no other, yet he recalled how Asuka told them that Kaworu was like that nebulous vampire character in that movie, a gray area where the distinction between friend or foe had blurred.  
这难以想象。自从他到来后，渚薰证明了自己值得信赖，是一个无可比拟的和平缔造者，然而他记得明日香曾告诉他们，渚薰就像那部电影中模糊的吸血鬼角色，一个灰色地带，朋友与敌人的界限已变得模糊。

Shinji frowned. He felt uneasy about the idea of Kaworu as a potential enemy, so he decided that he would have to ask him face-to-face as soon as they meet again down at the 'Front.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。他对卡尔作为潜在敌人的想法感到不安，因此他决定一旦他们在“前线”再次见面，就要当面问清楚。

In Tsutomo's case, he was fighting the pangs of sleep trying to take over his system, while with his hands on the wheel. He'd been up for most of the night after a day full of action, and despite his training he was tired, really yearned to hit the sack, so the best he could do to stay up was to make small talk with his fellow agent alongside him, the same agent who tried to open and access Oda's cellular phone and laptop.  
就津友来说，他正与困意作斗争，双手紧握方向盘。经过一整天忙碌的行动后，他几乎整夜未眠，尽管受过训练，他仍感到疲惫，非常渴望上床睡觉，因此他唯一能做的就是与坐在旁边的同事闲聊，这位同事正是试图打开和访问织田手机和笔记本电脑的那位。

"I'm supposed to go on a date later today," Tsutomo said to the agent, whose attached ID card carried the name of Shinichi Morisato and a rank of lieutenant. The younger agent had both phone and laptop wrapped in a plastic bag, and this parcel rode on his lap.  
“我今天晚些时候还要去约会，”津友对那位同事说，他的身份证上写着森里真一的名字和少尉军衔。这位年轻的同事将手机和笔记本电脑装在塑料袋里，放在膝上。

"With whom?" Shinichi asked.  
“和谁？” 新一问道。

"Doctor Odani. Had a lot planned for the day; checking out the amusement park, and then dinner for two. But, shit, we had to call off the whole thing because of the damned yellow alert."  
“小谷医生。今天安排了很多事；先去游乐场，然后是两人的晚餐。但是，该死，因为那该死的黄色警报，我们不得不取消了所有计划。”

Now their small convoy halted at the sentry post, and two guards went over and turned on their flashlights, shining the beam upon the SUV, before one of the guards, holding an extended mirror, went about checking the vehicle's underside for any bombs. The second guard knocked on the window, and Tsutomo lowered the glass separating them, handed over a sheet and his ID card. The guard looked over both documents twice, before returning them to Tsutomo and then saluted. Tsutomo returned the salute and said, "Thanks. Good morning."  
现在，他们的小车队在哨所前停下，两名警卫走过去打开手电筒，将光束照在 SUV 上，其中一名警卫拿着一面伸缩镜，开始检查车辆的底部是否有炸弹。第二名警卫敲了敲车窗，堤人将隔离玻璃降下，递出一张纸和身份证。警卫仔细检查了两份文件，然后归还给堤人，并敬了个礼。堤人回礼并说：“谢谢。早上好。”

"My pleasure," the guard replied before the window went up, and Tsutomo stepped on the gas, driving the Suburban forward to the tunnel leading to the car train. The agent glanced at the rear view mirror, watching the guards go over Misato's car, doing the same process.  
"乐意效劳。" 警卫回答后车窗升起，筒本踩下油门，驾驶着郊外型车向前驶向通往汽车列车的隧道。特工瞥了一眼后视镜，看着警卫们检查美里子的车，进行同样的程序。

"How long do you think the alert's gonna last?" Shinichi wondered.  
"你觉得警报会持续多久？" 进一问道。

Tsutomo shrugged. "Not damn sure, except it should end this afternoon, you know that. Hope nothing bad happens today so it shouldn't get upgraded to red status."  
筒本耸了耸肩。"不太确定，只知道应该会在今天下午结束，你知道的。希望今天不要发生什么坏事，这样就不会升级到红色状态。"

Once past the thick steel armored door, Tsutomo drove the Suburban into one of the slots on the train, and the locks clamped on the tires. The older agent drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, waiting for the train to go.  
穿过厚重的钢制装甲门后，筒本驾驶着郊区车驶入火车的一个槽位，轮胎随即被锁紧。老特工用手指敲打着方向盘，等待火车启动。

"What about the weapons that got here? Where and when we would be using all that?" Shinichi questioned. "Armageddon?"  
“那些运来的武器怎么办？我们会在哪里、什么时候用到这些？”进次郎问道，“世界末日吗？”

"In case we piss off even an army of millions," Tsutomo answered, "and we would have to hold 'em back. That's what we're supposed to be prepared for."  
“以防我们激怒了数百万的大军，”筒本回答，“而我们必须挡住他们。这就是我们准备的目的。”

---

With her Alpine parked in the car train's slot and its tires locked in place, Misato sighed, closed her eyes and relaxed against the headrest.  
她的阿尔派车停在了火车车厢的指定位置，轮胎固定好，美里叹了口气，闭上眼睛，靠在头枕上放松下来。

Exhausted, she felt a mix of emotions, a result of many events for more than 24 hours; she was elated for being promoted and thanked for her actions under fire; she was happy about her charges' turnaround; she doubted Kaworu and his sketchy background; she was victorious in battle.  
筋疲力尽的她，心情复杂，这是过去超过 24 小时众多事件的结果；她因晋升和在火线下的行动受到感谢而兴奋；她为她的学生们转危为安而高兴；她对渚薰及其可疑背景感到怀疑；她在战斗中取得了胜利。

Yet she was regretful for one thing: the killer denied her the chance to consummate the revenge she promised herself before Kaji's grave. If it weren't for the poison capsule, with her fury Misato would've squeezed the answers from that Eiji Oda and shoot the sonofabitch afterwards.  
然而，她对一件事感到遗憾：那个杀手剥夺了她向加治墓前发誓要复仇的机会。如果不是因为那颗毒胶囊，凭着她的愤怒，美里本可以从那个 Eiji Oda 那里挤出答案，然后一枪崩了那个混蛋。

_What's next?_ Misato asked, pursing her lips as she felt the car train lurch forward for its journey down to HQ. She was damn sure only one party was capable of issuing commands to destroy them, but until she could gain some evidence of their wrongdoing, Misato placed her greatest suspicions upon SEELE.  
接下来是什么？Misato 问道，她噘着嘴，感觉到列车开始向前行驶，前往总部。她非常确定只有一方有能力下达摧毁他们的命令，但在她能获得他们不当行为的证据之前，Misato 将最大的怀疑放在了 SEELE 身上。

Suddenly Gendo Ikari woke up with a start from his bed, sweating. In the near darkness, he blinked, breathing profusely. He fumbled for the bedside lamp and turned it on, and the bedroom was now in light. Amongst the immense clutter of his bedroom, the alarm clock on the desk told him it was almost 2:30 in the morning.  
突然，Gendo Ikari 从床上惊醒，满头大汗。在近乎黑暗中，他眨了眨眼，呼吸急促。他摸索着床头灯并打开，卧室顿时亮了起来。在他卧室的巨大杂乱中，桌上的闹钟告诉他现在快到凌晨两点半了。

It was a nightmare, and in it, he saw himself transported back in time, standing before the half-finished Unit-01, behind the armor-plated glass windows of the control room. Unit-01's face was plugged in with a dozen cables, and her eyes stared back at him. However, the atmosphere around him was engulfed in chaos, with technicians scurrying about, shouting, and frantically trying to save his wife. He tried to move, but his feet were stuck on the floor, forcing him to witness the pandemonium and of his wife's fate. He tried to speak, but no words came out of his mouth.  
那是一场噩梦，在梦中，他发现自己回到了过去，站在尚未完工的初号机前，透过控制室的装甲玻璃窗。初号机的脸上插满了数十根电缆，她的眼睛回望着他。然而，周围的气氛被混乱所笼罩，技术人员四处奔走，呼喊着，疯狂地试图拯救他的妻子。他想移动，但双脚却牢牢地粘在地上，迫使他目睹这场混乱以及他妻子的命运。他想说话，但嘴里发不出任何声音。

Gendo felt helpless. It was the moment when Unit-01 took her away, and reduced the woman into a liquid state.  
源堂感到无助。那是零号机将她带走，并将那女人化为液态的时刻。

_Why?_ Gendo wondered. _Why could you do such a thing? Are you doing this for Shinji? Why can't you say something, what have you done?_  
为什么？源堂疑惑。你为何能做出这样的事？是为了真嗣吗？为何你一言不发，你究竟做了什么？

_Why did you leave me?  
为何你要离开我？_

For a minute Gendo tried to clear his mind, before he rose from the bed, walked up to get his clothes and then headed straight to the bathroom.  
有那么一会儿，源度试图清空思绪，随后他从床上起身，走过去拿衣服，然后径直走向浴室。

As he turned on the faucet, the shower head spraying him with warm water, Gendo sighed and decided to remember something else to squelch the nightmare out of his mind; he recalled the time when he found himself right on top of Yui's form.  
当他打开水龙头，花洒喷出温暖的水流时，源度叹了口气，决定回忆些别的事情来驱散脑海中的噩梦；他想起了自己俯视着唯的那一刻。

Her scent, the warmth, softness and the smoothness of her skin, the soft lips, and that gentle voice, as he ran his hand over her brown hair. He could still remember those sensations, and he felt hard all over again. There was no other woman like her. Nobody. The Akagi women were nothing compared to Yui.  
她的香气，温暖，柔软以及肌肤的光滑，柔软的唇瓣，还有那温柔的声音，当他抚摸着她棕色的秀发。他仍能记得那些感觉，全身再次感到一阵悸动。没有其他女人能像她一样。没有人。赤木家的女人根本无法与唯相比。

Back then he felt lucky, the woman of his dreams, her presence compelling him to do anything, even if he must move mountains.  
那时他觉得自己无比幸运，梦想中的女人，她的存在驱使他去做任何事，哪怕要移山填海。

Just for her. 只为她。

Oh, how much it took for him to reach her, because Yui had everything he wanted in a woman, and _more_; she was the key to the fulfillment of his burning ambitions, her connections influential and powerful, and through Yui and her knowledge he thought he finally possessed the power of gods, with the ability to remake the world as he wanted, to transcend his limitations.  
哦，他为了接近她付出了多少，因为结衣拥有他想要的一切，甚至更多；她是实现他炽热野心的关键，她的关系网强大而有影响力，通过结衣和她所掌握的知识，他以为自己终于拥有了神一般的力量，能够按照自己的意愿重塑世界，超越自身的局限。

But without warning Unit-01 snatched her from his presence, without even saying farewell or something, except maybe…  
但毫无预警地，01 号机将她从他面前夺走，甚至没有道别或任何话语，除了或许……

"Damn," Gendo muttered as he shut off the water. He stepped out of the shower, toweled off and went about dressing himself.  
“该死，”碇源堂低声咒骂，关掉水龙头。他走出淋浴间，擦干身体，开始穿衣服。

Finished, Gendo stared at himself in the mirror, fully-dressed yet without the glasses. His face, framed by the beard, had the faint scars of bruises and scratches, reminders of his violent past. Age has just caught up with him, furrows and creases crisscrossing his forehead, and sour creases at the ends of his mouth. Only his eyes, despite having little sleep, remained black as coal, determined and yet in rare occasions they can become soft and pleading, hence the tinted glasses.  
穿戴完毕后，碇源堂凝视镜中的自己，衣冠楚楚却未戴眼镜。他的脸庞被胡须环绕，隐约可见瘀伤和抓痕的疤痕，提醒着他暴力的过往。岁月终于追上了他，额头上的皱纹纵横交错，嘴角下垂处刻着苦涩的痕迹。唯有他的眼睛，尽管睡眠不足，依旧漆黑如炭，坚定不移，但偶尔也会变得柔和而恳求，这便是他戴有色眼镜的原因。

The man before the mirror sighed, and whispered, "We're having so little time, and we've lost the Lance to the moon, the instrument that could prevent us from making our hopes coming true. The Angel's coming soon, and once it's dead… there's nothing to stop us. Not even the old men."  
镜前的男子叹息着，低语道：“时间如此短暂，我们失去了月之矛，那本可阻止我们实现希望的工具。天使即将降临，一旦它消亡……便再无阻挡我们的力量。即便是那些老人也无法阻止。”

Gendo sighed and straightened himself.  
源渡叹了口气，挺直了身子。

"Yui… You just have to wait for me," he promised, and picked up the tinted glasses off his desk.  
“唯…你只需等我，”他承诺道，并从桌上拿起那副墨镜。

The trilling of Kozo Fuyutsuki's home phone made the old man wake up, and he rose from the couch. He shook his head and blinked, before taking hold of the phone's receiver and said, "Hello?"  
冢中藤志的家用电话铃声响起，将老人从沙发上唤醒。他摇了摇头，眨了眨眼，然后拿起电话听筒，说道：“喂？”

"Good morning, sir," Hamamoto said. "Sorry for causing much of a fuss, but someone broke into Katsuragi's home, and attempted to assassinate the Second Children. We also have a breakthrough after we were able to extract some info from one of the terrorists."  
“早上好，先生，”滨本说，“很抱歉引起这么大的骚动，但有人闯入了葛城家，并试图暗杀第二适格者。我们还从一名恐怖分子那里获得了一些突破性的信息。”

The news blew away Fuyutsuki's stupor. "What?"  
这个消息让冬月清醒过来。“什么？”

Hamamoto explained everything, what he knew, and by the end Fuyutsuki frowned. "Anything else?" he asked.  
浜本解释了他所知道的一切，到最后冬月皱起了眉头。“还有别的吗？”他问道。

"We do have some potential evidence, to give us some vital leads," Hamamoto said, and mentioned about the killer's cellphone and the laptop computer.  
“我们确实有一些潜在的证据，能给我们一些关键线索，”浜本说，并提到了凶手的手机和笔记本电脑。

Fuyutsuki questioned, "Any progress so far on those things?"  
冬月追问道：“那些东西目前有什么进展吗？”

"I'm afraid we really need to crack them open, so I had them sent to the lab. Apart from that, it's necessary that we must keep the Children safe, and I ordered Katsuragi to get the Children down to HQ."  
"恐怕我们真的需要打开它们，所以我让人把它们送到了实验室。除此之外，我们必须确保孩子们的安全，我已命令葛城去把孩子们带到总部。"

Fuyutsuki glanced at the wall clock right above the bookshelf. 2:46 in the morning, its hands told him. "I see," the old ex-professor said.  
冬月瞥了一眼书架上方墙上的时钟。指针告诉他现在是凌晨 2 点 46 分。“我明白了，”这位前教授老者说道。

"Should we encounter difficulty with those gadgets, I request that we enlist the help of Doctor Akagi, and let her give a shot at cracking."  
"如果我们在这些装置上遇到困难，我请求我们寻求赤木博士的帮助，让她尝试破解。"

Fuyutsuki had a double-take. "Why her?"  
冬月愣了一下。“为什么是她？”

"Because she's the best, bar none, sir. In her profession, she goes where even my top techs can't sneak in."  
“因为她是最棒的，无人能及，长官。在她那个领域，她能去到连我的顶尖技术人员都无法潜入的地方。”

The old man nodded. "Okay, Director, I'll see what I can do. But first I need someone to pick me up and bring me to HQ. While I wait, I'll make some coffee. Sorry, I had a bit of a hangover."  
老人点点头。“好吧，局长，我会看看能做些什么。但首先我需要有人来接我，带我去总部。在我等待的时候，我会泡些咖啡。抱歉，我有点宿醉。”

"Sure, no problem," Hamamoto agreed. "I'll see you later, sir."  
“当然，没问题，”Hamamoto 同意道，“回头见，先生。”

Once the man on the other side broke off the connection, Fuyutsuki placed the phone back into the cradle, sighed, and figured that it was time to get going. He then shook his head and mumbled, "All the trouble because of one woman..."  
当电话那头的人挂断后，Fuyutsuki 将电话放回座机，叹了口气，觉得是时候动身了。他随后摇了摇头，喃喃自语：“全因一个女人，惹出这么多麻烦……”

**Author's Notes:** It's been a tough month lately, trying to fight off a bad case of writer's block as a result of my increased workload IRL and last week's illness. I had to concentrate on what to do next, plan the succeeding chapters before writing.  
作者笔记：最近这个月真是艰难，由于现实生活中的工作量增加和上周的病痛，我遭遇了严重的写作障碍。我必须集中精力思考接下来的情节，规划后续章节再动笔。

Here's some tips: (1) beware of the excessive use of so-called "Swifties" (after Tom Swift, the main hero in stories written by Victor Appleton II) as dialogue attributions (see Stephen King's _On Writing_, at page 125 in the use/abuse of such attributions); (2) using adverbs is like walking on a minefield; (3) _said_, IMHO, is universally effective at all times for character dialogue, even under fire.  
以下是一些建议：（1）注意避免过度使用所谓的“斯威夫蒂”（源自维克多·阿普尔顿二世笔下的主人公汤姆·斯威夫特）作为对话归属词（参见斯蒂芬·金的《写作这回事》第 125 页，关于此类归属词的使用与滥用）；（2）使用副词犹如在雷区行走；（3）在我看来，“说”在任何情况下都是角色对话中普遍有效的表达方式，即便在枪林弹雨中也是如此。

This chapter is dedicated to Weltall Elite, whom I believe he's still assigned to Airborne, still on his tour of duty.  
这篇chapter献给 Weltall Elite，我相信他仍在空降部队服役，依旧在执行任务中。

### Chapter 23 The Morning After  
Chapter 23 翌日清晨

_Half-naked and only wearing a white loincloth, Kaworu saw himself kneeling in the middle of a circle formed by twelve men in black hooded robes, all chanting in some ancient language. The obsidian marble floor had an unusual glyph edged in white, perhaps obtained from ancient Cabbalist symbolism. Only the single brightest light was on Kaworu, the centerpiece of this ceremony, while at the far four corners of this dark chamber were burning torches, symbolically placed to represent the four elements, four seasons, four directions and four cycles.  
半裸着只穿一条白色缠腰布，渚薰发现自己跪在一个由十二名身着黑色连帽长袍的男人围成的圈中，他们正用某种古老语言吟唱着。黑曜石地板上刻有一个边缘为白色的奇特符号，或许是源自古代卡巴拉象征主义。只有一束最亮的光打在渚薰身上，他是这场仪式的中心，而在黑暗房间的四个远角，燃烧的火把象征性地摆放着，代表着四大元素、四季、四方和四重循环。_

_A man, in a robe like the others but looking portly, slowly walked towards him with one hand bearing an incense holder, smoking and swinging in rhythm to the man's pace; the other hand holding what looked like a dagger. His ceremonial chest plate, wrought of gold and brass sheets, was decorated with twelve differently colored jewels, sparkling brilliantly in the light.  
一个男子，与其他人一样身着长袍，但看起来较为肥胖，缓缓向他走来，一手持着冒烟的香炉，随着步伐节奏摇摆；另一手握着看似匕首的东西。他胸前的仪式护甲，由金铜片制成，镶嵌着十二颗不同颜色的宝石，在灯光下闪耀着璀璨光芒。_

_Kaworu never moved an inch, as this was an auspicious ceremony, and the man circled him, wreathing the young man in frankincense smoke, chanting seemingly incomprehensible words. The gift for languages allowed Kaworu to translate the man's speech from Aramaic:  
渚薰一动不动，因为这是一场吉祥的仪式，那人绕着他转圈，用乳香烟雾缭绕着年轻人，吟唱着似乎难以理解的词句。语言天赋使渚薰能够将那人的话语从亚拉姆语翻译出来：_

"_The son of ancients, of a distant past, created by men beyond the stars, a gift towards to the fulfillment of our aspirations, the one perfect instrument among a few to restore all life to the first form, to bring about peace and equalize all beings, to purify and cleanse souls free of sin and pollution._  
远古之子，来自遥远的过去，由星辰之外的人类所创造，是我们实现愿望的礼物，是少数完美工具之一，旨在恢复所有生命至最初形态，带来和平并使众生平等，净化并洗净灵魂，使其免于罪恶与污染。

"_Hear us, o Lord, for we call upon you to bless our messenger with your mercy and guidance. Hear us, for we hope to obtain the future and to bring about the destiny of man to come as one, in peace as one being, everlasting and free."_  
听啊，主啊，我们呼唤您，祈求您以慈悲和指引祝福我们的使者。听啊，因为我们希望获得未来，实现人类的命运，团结如一，和平共存，永恒自由。

_The man now faced Kaworu, glancing down upon him, and revealed himself with a quick uncovering of his hood.  
那人现在面对着渚薰，俯视着他，迅速掀开兜帽，显露出自己的真容。_

_SEELE Chairman Keel Lorenz, solemn in leading the ceremony, now slowly and carefully touched each of Kaworu's shoulders with the dagger-like object, as though he was blessing or knighting him. As he did, he continued murmuring the words:  
SEELE 主席基尔·洛伦兹，庄严地主持着仪式，此刻正缓慢而谨慎地用匕首状的物体轻触卡罗尔的每个肩膀，仿佛在为他祝福或授勋。与此同时，他继续低声念诵着：_

"_The symbolic Spear, used in the sacrifice of the Son of Man, the instrument that confirmed His divinity, is to bless our messenger with your providence, to ensure that our hopes would be fulfilled, even if challenged by many of our profane enemies. May it please you that this young man will accomplish the tasks he would be facing."_  
“象征性的长矛，用于人子的献祭，确认其神性的工具，愿您的神意赐福于我们的使者，确保我们的希望得以实现，即便面对众多亵渎之敌的挑战。愿您满意，这位年轻人将完成他所面临的任务。”

_The old man withdrew the spearhead back into the folds of his robe.  
老人将矛头收回长袍的褶皱中。_

"_Now, rise, young man," Keel spoke, and Kaworu got up to his feet._  
"现在，站起来，年轻人，"基尔说道，卡沃鲁站起身来。

_The old man took a breath for a moment, and said, "Will you accept this most holy and sacred task given to you?"  
老人深吸了一口气，问道："你愿意接受这个神圣而庄严的任务吗？"_

"_Yes," Kaworu answered._ "是的，"卡沃鲁回答道。

"_Do you have any conscience or misgivings about this task? If so, state the reason why."_  
"你对此任务有何良心或顾虑吗？如果有，请说明原因。"

"_No, I have not and my destiny has been set."_  
"没有，我无所顾虑，我的命运已定。"

_Keel nodded, as if satisfied. "Now that you have accepted your destiny, you, Tabris, are to fulfill our divine will."  
基尔点头，似乎感到满意。“既然你已接受你的命运，塔布里斯，你将执行我们的神圣意志。”_

"_I will not fail," Kaworu promised as he bowed before Keel._  
"我不会失败，"渚薰在基路面前鞠躬承诺道。

_In unison, the others in the circle all chanted in response:  
圆圈中的其他人齐声回应道：_

"_May the Lord bless Tabris to fulfill the sacred prophecies of our forebears; may woe, brimstone and fire befall upon those who oppose us."_  
"愿主保佑塔布里斯完成我们祖先的神圣预言；愿那些反对我们的人遭受痛苦、硫磺与火焰的惩罚。"

After being helped by Tsutomo on their way with their baggage from the parking lot, Misato, Shinji and Asuka arrived at their designated quarters at the BOQ, the largest NERV could provide for visiting delegations, like a hotel suite: there were four beds, a sofa and a coffee table, TV, stereo and a computer; a simple dining table, a kitchenette and small fridge, a bathroom, and opposite the front door was a wide window with a panoramic view of the Geofront.  
在筒本的帮助下，美里、真嗣和明日香带着行李从停车场来到了他们在 BOQ 的指定住处，这是 NERV 能为来访代表团提供的最大房间，宛如酒店套房：内有四张床、一张沙发和咖啡桌、电视、音响和电脑；一个简易餐桌、小厨房和迷你冰箱、一间浴室，正对前门的是一扇宽大的窗户，可以俯瞰整个 Geofront 的壮丽景色。

But for now it was dark outside, and having set down their baggage onto the floor, both Children plopped themselves onto the beds without a word and, to their surprise, quickly fell asleep.  
但此刻外面一片漆黑，孩子们把行李放在地板上后，便一言不发地倒在床上，令他们惊讶的是，很快就沉沉睡去。

However, the woman sat on the edge of her bed, and still wearing her rumpled duty uniform. The adrenaline rush somehow remained, forcing her to be wide-eyed. She needed something to do, anything just to knock herself out, and Misato spotted her cooler, just parked by her bed. The woman opened the cooler, brought out a can of Yebisu, and pulled the tab.  
然而，那女人坐在床边，依旧穿着她那皱巴巴的制服。肾上腺素的激增不知为何仍未消退，迫使她瞪大了眼睛。她需要做点什么，任何事都好，只求能让自己昏过去，这时美里注意到了床边的那只冷却器。她打开冷却器，取出一罐惠比寿啤酒，拉开了拉环。

Taking a swig, the taste and the coolness of the brew instantly soothed her, and as she was halfway emptying the can, her cellular phone rang.  
喝了一口，啤酒的滋味和凉意立刻安抚了她，当她喝到一半时，手机响了。

Misato picked it up and pressed the 'Call' key. "Hello?" she asked.  
美里拿起手机，按下了接听键。“喂？”她问道。

"This is Fuyutsuki," the caller said. "You're still awake?"  
"我是冬月，" 对方说道，"你还没睡吗？"

The woman blinked as she set aside her beer. "Oh, good morning, sir…. Sorry. Yes, I'm up but about to sleep. You need something?"  
女子眨了眨眼，放下手中的啤酒。"哦，早上好，先生……抱歉。是的，我还没睡，但正准备睡了。您需要什么吗？"

"Since Miss Langley wanted to get back into Unit Two, I'm going to arrange for that Eva to be set up in place for her sync test, and before that, her physical examination, just to make sure. Is it okay if we have it scheduled later, say, around ten?"  
"既然兰利小姐想要重新进入二号机，我打算为她安排同步测试，在此之前，先进行身体检查，确保一切无误。我们能否将时间安排在稍晚些，比如十点左右？"

Misato blinked again. "Ah… thank you, sir. Ten o'clock would be fine… But why so early? You're coming here?"  
美里再次眨了眨眼。“啊……谢谢您，先生。十点可以……但为什么这么早？您要过来吗？”

"Yes. Director Hamamoto called me at home, told me everything about what happened to you people, and that woke me up."  
“是的。滨本导演在家打电话给我，告诉我你们发生的一切，这让我清醒了。”

"I see," Misato said, and she glanced at the alarm clock on the bedside: 3:14 in the morning. "I'm sorry for getting ourselves into trouble. However, sir, I'm trying to get some shut-eye, it's been a long day for me."  
“我明白了，”美里说，她瞥了一眼床头的闹钟：凌晨 3 点 14 分。“很抱歉我们惹了麻烦。不过，先生，我正试着睡一会儿，今天对我来说太漫长了。”

"That would be right," Fuyutsuki said. "Okay, since you're real tired, we'll talk later. Go get some sleep."  
“那就对了，”冬月说，“好吧，既然你真的很累，我们改天再谈。去睡会儿吧。”

"Thank you, sir. My pleasure," Misato replied, before Fuyutsuki hung up. Only then Misato took off her uniform jacket and shoulder holster, checked her pistol and unloaded it free of the magazine. She then set the weapon down on the bedside table, finished off the beer, rest her head upon a pillow and yawned. Briefly she glanced at her sleeping charges, before Misato closed her eyes and tried not to think of anything else.  
“谢谢您，长官。乐意之至，”美里回答，直到冬月挂断电话。这时美里才脱下制服外套和肩枪套，检查了手枪并卸下弹匣。随后她将武器放在床头柜上，喝完啤酒，头枕在枕头上打了个哈欠。她短暂地看了一眼熟睡的孩子们，然后闭上眼睛，尽量不去想其他事情。

On the other side of the world, at an airbase near Dresden, Keel Lorenz was going up the steps to a waiting hypersonic transport, the same plane used to ferry Kaworu to Japan. Two of his guards trailed him, while he was following another, leading to his seat in a special section, which resembled more like an office, replete with flatscreen displays and electronic wizardry to rival Air Force One.  
在世界的另一端，德累斯顿附近的一个空军基地，基尔·洛伦兹正走上等待的超音速运输机的台阶，这架飞机与运送渚薰到日本的飞机相同。两名警卫跟在他身后，而他则跟随另一名警卫，前往他的专用座位区，那里更像一个办公室，配备有平板显示屏和能与空军一号媲美的电子设备。

Once he sat down, the first thing he did was to pick up a report presented on his desk, and then read:  
他一坐下，首先拿起的是桌上的一份报告，随即开始阅读：

**HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY PROJECT  
人类补完计划  
26****TH** **OPERATIONAL REPORT – 12/22/2015**CHAIRMAN LORENZ EYES ONLY  
操作报告 – 2015 年 12 月 22 日 仅限洛伦兹主席查阅  
TOP SECRET NOFORN NOCOPY - DESTROY AFTER READING  
绝密文件 禁止外传 阅后即毁

He skimmed through, but didn't have to read the whole report—forty or so pages—to know that all nine Evas were built and paid for; that Colonel Quaritch and praetorian guards under his command were armed and ready for the assault; the falsified press releases were properly prepared to deceive the world, and it was all money well-spent.  
他匆匆浏览了一遍，无需细读整个报告——大约四十页——便已知晓所有九台 EVA 均已建造并支付完毕；夸里奇上校及其麾下的禁卫军已武装待命，准备发起攻击；伪造的新闻稿也已妥善准备，足以欺骗世界，这一切花费都物有所值。

However, the same wasn't said for his operatives, including one tasked to play havoc within NERV, and another who was supposed to liquidate Asuka; both were expending his time and perhaps even his money. On the other hand, he was satisfied with the death of Seymour Nunn, a protective measure to ensure that the now-dead astronomer's secret, potentially explosive, will be buried along with his mortal body.  
然而，对于他的特工们，包括一名被指派在 NERV 内部制造混乱的，以及另一名本应清算明日香的任务，情况则不尽相同；这两项任务都在消耗他的时间和可能还有他的金钱。另一方面，他对西摩·纳恩的死亡感到满意，这是一项保护措施，确保这位已故天文学家的秘密，一个潜在的爆炸性秘密，将随着他的肉身一同埋葬。

Keel put down the report and buckled up, just as he felt the plane was rolling on the runway for take-off. Instead of riding out the storm in his Dresden bunker, he preferred to take this flight to SEELE's secret Siberian base, personally inspect the Evas and Quaritch's army, before waiting for the rest of the council to convene in that base for their second-to-the-last meeting prior to their planned Third Impact. Right there, he would also listen to Kaworu's first-hand report, and reemphasize to that Angel about his supposed mission.  
基尔放下报告，系好安全带，就在这时，他感觉到飞机正在跑道上滑行准备起飞。与其在德累斯顿的掩体中躲避风暴，他更愿意乘坐这趟航班前往 SEELE 的秘密西伯利亚基地，亲自检查 Eva 和夸里奇的军队，然后在基地等待其他议会成员集结，参加他们计划中的第三次冲击前的倒数第二次会议。在那里，他还将听取渚薰的第一手报告，并向那位天使重申其假定的任务。

But whether Kaworu obeys or breaks his prerogatives, Keel knew that young man must die for the sake of the Scrolls; he was born for this, supposedly to champion on behalf of his brethren, yet must sacrifice himself in lieu of fighting.  
但无论渚薰服从还是违背他的指示，基尔知道，为了《死海古卷》，那个年轻人必须死；他生来就是为了代表他的同胞而战，却必须牺牲自己以代替战斗。

That was part of the plan, and Keel hoped that nothing should go wrong on them, that their technological and military superiority should win them the fulfillment of Instrumentality.  
这是计划的一部分，基尔希望一切都能顺利进行，他们的科技和军事优势将确保他们实现人类补完计划。

By the time the hypersonic transport was ten kilometers above the Earth, Keel made a satellite phone call to SEELE's only surviving mole within NERV.  
当超音速运输机在地球上空一万米时，基尔拨通了 SEELE 在 NERV 中唯一幸存的间谍的卫星电话。

In the parking lot just outside the linear train station, Sanderson was smoking a cigarette in his car, waiting for almost an hour after a light breakfast of coffee and a bagel, anxious for dawn to break above the mountains, when his cellphone rang. He picked it up, and knew who was calling. No names, of course, as he was always reminded.  
在线性列车站外的停车场里，桑德森在他的车里抽着烟，在喝了一杯咖啡和一个百吉饼的简单早餐后，已经等了近一个小时，焦急地盼望着山巅之上破晓的到来，这时他的手机响了。他拿起电话，知道是谁打来的。当然，没有名字，正如他总是被提醒的那样。

"Yes?" Sanderson said, flicking the cigarette butt away.  
“喂？”桑德森说着，弹掉了烟蒂。

A scrambled voice answered back. "You have a job to do," it said. "Listen closely."  
一个杂音回答道：“你有任务在身，”它说，“仔细听着。”

Sanderson was ready. "Okay."  
桑德森已经准备好了。“好的。”

"One, we want the Fifth Children monitored carefully, and report back for any discrepancies, and should he falter, turn him in. Two, investigate the unusual shipment that came yesterday by freight train. Three, we still want the Second Children eliminated. Four, you may go ahead and sabotage any vital systems they have in there, to cripple their ability to defend themselves. Finally, since that traitor Kaji stole Adam from us and presumably gave it to Ikari, we want to know where he is hiding it. Above all, report to us anything out of the ordinary."  
“一，我们要密切监视第五儿童，一旦发现任何异常，立即汇报，如有必要，将他交出。二，调查昨天通过货运火车运来的那批不寻常货物。三，我们仍希望消灭第二儿童。四，你可以继续破坏他们内部的任何关键系统，削弱他们的自卫能力。最后，既然那个叛徒卡吉偷走了亚当并很可能交给了碇，我们要知道他把亚当藏在哪里了。最重要的是，向我们报告任何异常情况。”

"I got it all, sir." Sanderson asked about the now-dead triple agent. "As for Oda, he's dead by now, made himself expendable."  
"我全明白了，先生。" 桑德森询问起那位已故的三重间谍。"至于奥达，他现在已经死了，让自己变得可有可无。"

The caller cleared his throat. "I see, but it is up to you what must be done."  
来电者清了清嗓子。"我明白了，但具体怎么做由你决定。"

Sanderson nodded. "I understand. It's for Instrumentality, sir."  
桑德森点头。"我明白。这是为了实现‘机关’的目标，先生。"

"We admire your faith in it, so we now entrust to you this task. Good luck."  
“我们钦佩你对它的信念，因此现在将这项任务托付给你。祝你好运。”

**About Two Hours Later… 大约两小时后……**

Finished with her austere breakfast of toast and tea, Rei was dressed up in her usual school uniform, but contemplating as she sat on her chair, as the morning sun rose over the Pacific Ocean. She was giving herself a few minutes of self-reflection before leaving.  
结束了她简朴的早餐——吐司和茶，丽穿着她平常的校服，坐在椅子上沉思，此时晨光正洒在太平洋上。她在出门前给自己留了几分钟进行自我反思。

"Why?" Rei asked herself. _What was my past?_  
“为什么？”丽自问道。我的过去是什么？

Was there an ancient memory of her existence, long before men walked the face of the Earth? She didn't know, or perhaps she had no idea or she even possessed a mental block. Since Kaworu told her she carried two souls, one for herself, the other for the being called Lilith, she wondered why she should be a vessel for a strange entity.  
在她存在之前，是否有着古老的记忆，远在人类行走于地球表面之前？她不知道，或许她根本不了解，甚至可能存在心理障碍。自从渚薰告诉她，她承载着两个灵魂，一个是她自己的，另一个是属于名为莉莉丝的存在，她不禁疑惑为何自己会成为这样一个陌生实体的容器。

A memory flashed in her mind.  
一段记忆在她脑海中闪现。

Rei, then behind the controls of Unit-00 and, on orders of the Commander, as a last-ditch solution to destroy Asuka's winged tormentor, went down to Terminal Dogma to pull out the Spear of Longinus from Lilith. As if silently accepting the act and acknowledging the purpose behind it, Lilith merely shuddered.  
丽，随后操控着零号机，按照司令的命令，作为摧毁明日香翼状使徒的最后手段，前往终端教条区拔出了莉莉丝身上的朗基努斯之枪。仿佛无声地接受了这个行为并认可其背后的目的，莉莉丝只是微微颤抖。

But before she left the chamber, to go up and save Asuka, Rei thought she was hearing something from Lilith.  
但在离开房间，上去拯救明日香之前，丽觉得自己听到了莉莉丝的某种声音。

_When you shall be home once again?  
当你再次回家时？_

Rei shook her head. _I do not know._  
丽摇了摇头。我不知道。

Tsutomo was waiting at the front steps of the Pyramid, with Oda's laptop and phone still in the bag. Earlier he woke with a phone call from his boss, telling him to get ready and come down. However, even after sleeping for only two hours, woke up and drank two cans of black coffee, Calorimate, and an invigorating cold shower, Tsutomo was still feeling drowsy.  
筒本在金字塔前的台阶上等待着，包里还装着织田的笔记本电脑和手机。早些时候，他被老板的一个电话叫醒，告诉他准备好下来。然而，尽管只睡了两个小时，醒来后喝了两大罐黑咖啡、卡洛里美特，还冲了个提神的冷水澡，筒本仍然感到昏昏欲睡。

He looked at the scenery around the Geofront, parts of it still lush and green despite last month's Angel attack, which nearly demolished the Pyramid and rearranged part of the landscape with an N2 warhead and successive beam and artillery blasts.  
他环顾着地底都市的景色，尽管上个月使徒的袭击几乎摧毁了金字塔，并用 N2 炸弹和随后的光束炮击改变了部分地貌，但这里仍有部分区域依然郁郁葱葱，绿意盎然。

Tsutomo wondered where Natsumi was, and though he was tempted with the idea of giving her a call, he resisted the urge, didn't want to give the woman doctor a rude awakening as he knew that her last text message was around midnight, telling him she needed to sleep. But he was sure that Misato and the two Children were still asleep in their quarters. He checked his wristwatch: 6:25 AM.  
筒本在想夏美在哪里，虽然他很想给她打个电话，但还是忍住了，不想打扰那位女医生，因为他知道她最后一条短信是在午夜发的，告诉他她需要睡觉。但他确信美里和那两个孩子还在他们的房间里睡着。他看了看手表：早上 6 点 25 分。

He remembered their last conversation before he left.  
他记得离开前他们的最后一次对话。

Misato admitted that she was done crying and mourning, as Kaji's chapter has been finally closed, and though her revenge was foiled with that single vial of poison, it became obvious for her to undertake Kaji's quest and finish it, even at the risk of her life. But Tsutomo said that she can't do it on her own, that she could ask for help.  
美里承认她已经哭够了，哀悼结束了，因为终于处理好了加治的chapter，尽管她的复仇被那一小瓶毒药挫败了，但她显然要继续完成加治的使命，哪怕冒着生命危险。但筒本说，她不能独自去做这件事，她可以寻求帮助。

_Misato sighed. "Yeah, you're right. I can't simply do this personally. So what can you do?"  
美里叹了口气。“是啊，你说得对。我不能亲自去做这件事。那你能做什么？”_

"_Just tell me where to find," Tsutomo said. "Because even I'm wondering what's really going on behind the scenes."_  
“只要告诉我去哪里找，”筒友说。“因为连我自己也想知道幕后到底发生了什么。”

_The woman nodded. "Okay… But by the way, since we're now working as a team, just call me Misato."  
女人点点头。“好的……不过顺便说一句，既然我们现在是团队合作，就叫我美里吧。”_

"_Sure," Tsutomo agreed._ “当然，”筒友同意道。

_Misato smiled. "Thanks, partner. Give my regards to Natsumi."  
美里微笑着说：“谢谢，搭档。代我向夏美问好。”_

Just then he saw two black SUVs pull up to the curb and the doors opened, letting out Fuyutsuki and Hamamoto, and followed by the coterie of Section Two agents. With an obvious lack of sleep, both men looked as if they were in dire need of more coffee.  
就在这时，他看到两辆黑色 SUV 停在了路边，车门打开，藤木和滨本走了出来，后面跟着一群第二科的特工。两人明显睡眠不足，看起来急需再来点咖啡。

Tsutomo saluted, while his other arm tucked the parcel under. "Good morning, sir," he greeted, before his superiors returned the salute.  
堤文敬了个礼，另一只手则将包裹夹在腋下。“早上好，长官。”他问候道，随后上级们也回以敬礼。

"Why you're still carrying it?" Hamamoto asked.  
“为什么你还带着它？”滨本问。

"Need to keep it under my guard," Tsutomo answered. "As you said, you want me to hand over this bag to Doctor Akagi so that she could start working on them, but I think it's a better idea that we should all first personally pay her a visit."  
“需要时刻看守着，”堤文回答，“正如你所说，你想让我把这个包交给赤城医生，以便她能开始研究，但我认为我们最好先亲自去拜访她。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "I agree, Captain. Let's go, then."  
冬月点头。“我同意，队长。那我们走吧。”

They walked across the main hall, then to the elevators. Once inside one of them and Tsutomo pressed the button to go down, Hamamoto asked, "Any idea if Commander Ikari is awake?"  
他们穿过主厅，然后走向电梯。一进入其中一台电梯，筒友按下下降按钮，滨本问道：“伊卡里司令醒了吗？”

"He should be," Fuyutsuki said. "Fact is, he usually sleeps for three or four hours, and that's the average."  
“他应该醒了，”冬月说。“事实上，他通常睡三到四个小时，这是平均水平。”

Hamamoto said, "A restless man. I wonder what's in his head right now."  
滨本说：“一个不安分的人。不知道他现在脑子里在想什么。”

"I have no idea, except he's… Frankly, he's still driven and ambitious. Has a dream he wanted to get."  
“我不清楚，只是他……坦白说，他依然充满动力和野心。有一个他想要实现的梦想。”

The old director snorted. "What is it?"  
老导演哼了一声。“是什么？”

"The problem is that he never told me what he's really up to."  
"问题在于，他从未告诉我他真正的意图是什么。"

Hamamoto shook his head. "Last time I had a boss like that," he said, "it's back when I was in Sasebo as a lieutenant, fresh out of the naval academy, working with a martinet of an admiral who's just as bad as Hideki Tojo, aiming for another star while his personal Kempeitai terrorizes the rest of my staff. Comes to the office, expecting everyone to be up and working, say, eighty hours for a week, or they'll get their ass reamed. I thought I was about to get a bad episode of hypertension working with that sonofabitch."  
滨本摇了摇头。“上次遇到这样的上司，”他说，“那还是我在佐世保时，刚从海军学院毕业，作为一名少尉，与一个严苛得如同东条英机般的海军上将共事，他一心想再升一级，而他的私人宪兵队则对我的其他下属进行恐怖统治。他来到办公室，期望每个人都能连续工作，比如说，一周八十小时，否则就会受到严厉斥责。我以为和那个混蛋共事会让我高血压发作。”

"Ah, I see," Fuyutsuki said.

"Fortunately, I was lucky to get transfer orders to move up to Yokosuka, and as soon as I moved into the new base, first thing I did was to have a blood pressure checkup. Now I also wonder how the hell you manage to get along with the Commander."  
"幸运的是，我得到了调令，得以调到横须贺，一搬进新基地，我做的第一件事就是进行血压检查。现在我也好奇，你是怎么和指挥官相处的。"

"Simple," Fuyutsuki said. "Without me, he can't work; he can't have a confessor; and, I admit, he can't manage NERV easily, especially when you have about a dozen or so branches around the planet and you have to make most of the operational decisions on a daily basis. Finally, I'm the only one who could keep him from being a loose cannon, because he knows me, and I know him very well."  
"简单，" 冬月说，"没有我，他无法工作；他无法拥有告解者；而且，我承认，他无法轻松管理 NERV，尤其是当你在全球有大约十几个分支机构，并且每天都需要做出大部分运营决策时。最后，我是唯一能阻止他失控的人，因为他了解我，我也非常了解他。"

Halfway to Gate 18, Rei was walking on the dusty road when she heard a Humvee honking its horn behind her. Startled, she turned around and, from the open window, the driver gestured to her as the vehicle pulled over. Apparently the driver recognized her, with the tell-tale powder-blue hair.  
在前往 18 号闸门的半路上，绫波走在尘土飞扬的路上，突然听到一辆悍马在她身后按喇叭。她吃了一惊，转过身来，从敞开的车窗里，司机向她招手，车子也随之停下。显然司机认出了她，那标志性的淡蓝色头发就是线索。

"Hey, miss, I know you… Thought you might want a ride, 'cause we're heading your way," the driver said, wearing fatigues, clean-shaven and yet looked tired. By their uniforms and body armor Rei recognized him and two of his companions as part of NERV's security forces; she could also hear radio chatter coming from the network. They were probably at the end of their duty shift, and due to return to base. Rei nodded; the men were harmless, obviously offering a spare seat.  
"嘿，小姐，我认识你……想你可能需要搭个便车，因为我们正朝你的方向去，"司机说道，穿着迷彩服，面容干净，但看起来很疲惫。从他们的制服和防弹衣上，绫波认出他和另外两名同伴是 NERV 安全部队的一员；她还能听到网络中的无线电通讯声。他们可能快要结束值班，准备返回基地。绫波点点头；这些人显然是无害的，只是提供了一个空座位。

"Thank you. That would be acceptable," she said, and the passenger door swung open to let her climb in, before the Humvee rolled away.  
"谢谢。那样可以接受，"她说着，乘客门便自动打开，让她爬进车内，随后悍马车缓缓驶离。

As the girl tucked the hem of her skirt, adjusting to the hard seat, the troops introduced themselves to Rei; Staff Sergeant Hasegawa the driver, Corporals Kumamoto and Inoue were his companions. With their submachine guns emptied, safetied and stowed in bags at the back of the Humvee, they all admitted they were on-station at one of the checkpoints since last night, and now in need for breakfast and a shower before hitting the sack.  
女孩整理着裙摆，适应着硬邦邦的座位，士兵们向丽自我介绍；驾驶的是上士长濑川，他的同伴是下士熊本和井上。他们的冲锋枪已经清空、保险并存放在悍马车后部的袋子里，他们都承认自昨晚起就在其中一个检查站执勤，现在急需早餐和洗澡，然后才能上床休息。

"What business you're going to do down there today, miss?" Hasegawa asked, referring to NERV HQ.  
"小姐，您今天下去有什么事要办吗？"长濑川问道，指的是 NERV 总部。

"I am not sure," Rei said.  
"我不确定，"丽说。

"That's too bad. You're such a busy girl before," the driver remarked.  
"那太糟糕了。你之前可真是个大忙人啊，"司机说道。

Rei blinked. "How did you know?"  
丽眨了眨眼。"你怎么知道的？"

"Most guys, including us, know you're more often down at HQ than you spend time at school, judging from your uniform. Well, we still haven't seen you wear something other than that uniform of yours. I wonder if you have any sense of fashion."  
"大多数男生，包括我们，都知道你更多时候是在总部而不是在学校，从你的制服就能看出来。话说回来，我们还没见过你穿除了那套制服以外的衣服呢。不知道你有没有时尚感。"

"Fashion is the least of my concerns," Rei said.  
"时尚是我最不关心的事，" 丽说。"

"I see," Hasegawa said. "Speaking of fashion, my sister's still nuts about her clothes, and the problem with her, she buys a bunch of them from some label outlet, taking more than half of her salary, then after a month, sells them to a used clothes store. Crazy fads… Anyway, I thought you're always with the Commander."  
"我明白了，" 长谷川说。"说到时尚，我妹妹还是对衣服痴迷不已，她从某个品牌折扣店买了一大堆，花掉了她一半以上的薪水，然后过了一个月，又把它们卖给二手服装店。疯狂的潮流……话说回来，我以为你总是和指挥官在一起。"

"Why?" Rei asked, but corrected herself. "Yes, I was always with him before."  
"为什么？" 丽问道，随即纠正自己。"是的，我以前总是和他在一起。"

"That's right, he's almost stuck with you at almost everywhere, and I saw you many times with him. But now… What's up with him? Do you have any idea?"  
"没错，他几乎到哪儿都带着你，我多次看到你们在一起。但现在……他怎么了？你知道些什么吗？"

Rei shook her head. "I still do not know him well."  
丽摇了摇头。"我对他还是不太了解。"

Hasegawa frowned. "Oh. That's strange. What about the Third Children, the Ikari boy, whom you sometimes come with? He's the Commander's son, right?"  
长谷川皱了皱眉。“哦，这很奇怪。那第三适任者，碇君呢？你有时和他一起来的，他是司令的儿子，对吧？”

"Yes, he is," Rei confirmed. "He is a friend."  
“是的，他是，”绫波确认道。“他是朋友。”

Hasegawa shot a glance at his comrades, as if he wanted them to hear some juicy tidbit from the First Children's mouth, but he restrained himself, shaking his head; it would be too rude to ask, to clarify an ongoing rumor in the NERV grapevine, whether Rei was Shinji's girlfriend on the basis of their walks together.  
长谷川瞥了一眼他的同伴，仿佛想让他们从第一适任者口中听到什么劲爆的消息，但他克制住了自己，摇了摇头；直接问出口，澄清 NERV 内部流传的谣言，即绫波是否因为一起散步而成了真嗣的女朋友，未免太过无礼。

"Forgot something to tell you, Miss…?" Hasegawa trailed off, trying to recall Rei's full name, as he briefly glanced at a row of giant dump trucks and other heavy earthmoving equipment parked by the road, apparently the cleanup work on the city ruins halted as a result of the yellow alert.  
"忘了告诉你一件事，小姐……？" 长谷川说着，试图回忆丽的完整名字，同时他短暂地瞥了一眼路边停放的一排巨型自卸卡车和其他重型挖掘设备，显然是由于黄色警报，城市的废墟清理工作已经暂停。

"Ayanami," Rei said, supplying the proper answer. "What is it?"  
"绫波，" 丽回答道，给出了正确的答案。"什么事？"

"Okay, Miss Ayanami," Hasegawa said, nodding. "You know what happened yesterday to Major Katsuragi and your friends, right? The ambush that knocked off some of our fellows from my unit with an IED and a missile; two Humvees like this and all twelve of them, more than half wounded, and, God bless 'em, a few others we had to send home in a box."  
"好的，绫波小姐，" 长谷川点头说道。"你知道昨天葛城少校和你的朋友们发生了什么事吧？那场伏击，用 IED 和导弹击中了我们单位的一些人；两辆这样的悍马车和所有十二个人，超过一半受伤，还有，愿上帝保佑他们，有些人我们不得不把他们装在箱子里送回家。"

"Yes."

"Well, this early morning we heard on the net about the Major's home invaded by an assassin, trying to shoot the Second Children… again," he said. "Looks as if the killer wanted to make it more personal."  
"好吧，今天一大早我们在网上听到消息，说是少校的家被一名刺客入侵，企图再次向二号机驾驶员开枪，"他说道。"看起来杀手想要让事情变得更加私人化。"

Rei's eyes went wide. "What happened?"

Hasegawa briefly narrated the reportage they gleaned from the radio network throughout the wee hours, of the attempt on Asuka's life, and possibly the rest of her companions.  
长谷川简要叙述了他们在凌晨时分从广播网络中收集到的报道，关于对明日香生命的企图，以及可能波及她的同伴们。

"…and the problem is," Hasegawa continued, "Who wants to have that girl killed?"  
"……问题在于，"长谷川继续说道，"谁想要置那个女孩于死地？"

"I do not know," Rei said, but she looked worried this time.  
"我不知道，"丽说，但这次她看起来很担忧。

Hasegawa noted her facial expression. "What's wrong?"  
长谷川注意到她的表情。"怎么了？"

"I am now deeply concerned about their safety. Where are they?"  
"我现在非常担心他们的安全。他们在哪儿？"

"Not sure, but I guess they've been ordered to move over to HQ and bunk there. Security's tighter there, and though we're still on Yellow Alert, if another attack happens we might get a Red Alert, and with that nothing's gonna get in or out."  
不太确定，但我想他们已经被命令转移到总部并在那里驻扎。那里的安保更严密，虽然我们仍处于黄色警戒状态，但如果再次遭受攻击，我们可能会升级到红色警戒，届时一切进出都将受限。

In the Cafeteria, all three of them were eating their breakfast, after waking up an hour ago, showered and dressed.  
在食堂里，他们三人正在享用早餐，一小时前醒来，洗漱完毕并穿好了衣服。

Now, as the widescreen TV at one end of the dining room was tuned to CNN, with the newscaster speaking of today's events, Misato put down her cup of coffee and said to Asuka, "The Sub-Commander has arranged to prepare Unit Two at ten. You're still ready for it?"  
此时，餐厅一端的宽屏电视调到了 CNN 频道，新闻播报员正在报道今日事件，美里放下手中的咖啡杯，对明日香说道：“副司令安排在十点准备二号机。你准备好了吗？”

Asuka looked up from her half-finished plate of ham, eggs and bacon with a side of toast, and said, rather pleased, "Oh, good! I think I'm ready."  
明日香从她那盘半吃完的火腿、鸡蛋和培根配吐司上抬起头，颇为满意地说道：“哦，太好了！我想我已经准备好了。”

"You better get a checkup again," Misato suggested. "We want to make sure you're okay to go."  
“你最好再去检查一下，”美里建议道，“我们要确保你一切正常，可以出发。”

"Sure, no big deal," Asuka said, nodding before paying attention to her plate, and took a morsel of bacon and a bite of toast.  
"“当然，没什么大不了的，”明日香点头同意，然后继续专注于她的盘子，夹起一片培根，咬了一口吐司。”

"But…" Misato trailed off. "I'd better bring you first to the personnel office to have you reinstated."  
“但是……” 美里话说到一半停了下来。“我还是先带你去人事部恢复你的职位吧。”

Asuka remembered that her ID card was already invalidated with punched holes. "Oh, I see… I forgot about that."  
明日香记得她的身份证已经被打了孔，失效了。“哦，我明白了……我忘了这回事。”

Shinji, on the other hand as he ate a bowl of beef gyudon, had nothing to say except his mind was wandering elsewhere. He asked himself, _what to do today?_  
另一方面，真嗣一边吃着牛肉盖饭，一边心不在焉，除了想着今天该做什么之外，什么也没说。

He thought of Rei, and guessing what she was doing today; of Kaworu, what was he doing right now? Shinji also remembered his friends back at Tokyo-2, and what was up with them. Now how long this tense state of affairs could last? A few days, some weeks, months perhaps? When the next Angel would show up? What would happen next?  
他想起了丽，猜测她今天在做什么；还有渚薰，他现在又在做什么呢？真嗣也想起了在东京-2 的朋友们，他们最近怎么样了。这种紧张的状态还能持续多久？几天，几周，还是几个月？下一个使徒什么时候会出现？接下来会发生什么？

The young man sighed as if there was something still missing in him, and as if several tons of doubts landed upon him. Sure, he and Asuka settled their differences, and he had nothing to fear about Rei. Today, he guessed, he might have to go along or…  
年轻人叹了口气，仿佛内心还有什么缺失，仿佛有数吨重的疑虑压在他身上。当然，他和明日香解决了分歧，他对丽也没有什么可担心的。今天，他猜想，他可能不得不顺从或者……

"Shinji, are you all right?" Misato asked, breaking his reverie, causing him to blink.  
“真嗣，你还好吗？”美里问道，打断了他的沉思，让他眨了眨眼。

"Cat got your tongue again?" Asuka chimed in, before laughing lightly.  
"猫又把你的舌头叼走了？" 明日香插话道，随即轻声笑了起来。

"Yes? Uh… I'm not feeling sure today," he said, blinking.  
"是的？呃……我今天不太确定，" 他说着，眨了眨眼。

"What?"

Misato sighed. "Look, if you're thinking about what happened a few hours ago… Better forget it for now, and let Section Two deal with it until they come up with something new. If you're also worrying about our friends, we could call them later if we want to; they can handle themselves."  
美里叹了口气。"听着，如果你还在想几个小时前发生的事……最好暂时忘掉，让第二课去处理，直到他们想出新的办法。如果你也在担心我们的朋友，我们可以晚点想打给他们就打；他们能照顾好自己的。

"Okay," Shinji said.

Misato glanced at both Children and said, "Listen to me, you two. I have something else to say."  
美里瞥了一眼两个孩子，说道：“听着，你们俩。我还有别的事要说。”

The two Eva pilots paused to listen and looked back at their guardian, setting aside their food.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员停下动作，转头看向他们的监护人，暂时放下了手中的食物。

"Now that you have settled differences and broke down the wall," Misato said, "confess your love to each other, and finally understood each other's situations and secrets… I'm hoping that since you're now together, you should _succeed further_ where Kaji and I have failed."  
“既然你们已经化解了分歧，打破了隔阂，”美里说，“向对方坦露心迹，最终理解了彼此的处境和秘密……我希望，既然你们现在在一起了，能够在加治和我失败的地方取得成功。”

The woman closed her eyes for a while, and added, "Before me, you two finally said the words that Kaji was supposed to say to me but he never did, and so, I admit, I'm a bit envious of you both. Fate does have a strange way of bringing you together, and, well, you're destined for each other."  
女子闭上眼睛片刻，然后补充道：“在我面前，你们终于说出了本应由加持对我说却从未说出口的话，所以，我承认，我对你们俩有些羡慕。命运确实有其奇妙的方式将你们联系在一起，而且，你们注定是彼此的。”

Misato sighed, and continued, "So, from now on… Please, make the best of your relationship and of yourselves, work together as a team, and how you do… No, I mean, what _we do_ today would soon affect the outcome of this conflict we're still in, and we're the best of what humanity has to deliver against the Angels."  
美里叹了口气，继续说道：“所以，从现在开始……请，珍惜你们的关系，珍惜彼此，作为一个团队共同努力，以及我们今天所做的一切……不，我是说，我们今天的行动将很快影响到这场我们仍在进行的冲突的结果，而我们代表了人类对抗使徒的最强力量。”

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other, smiled and nodded, but Misato offered her pinky, and said, "Promise me you remember everything I said, right?"  
真嗣和明日香相视一笑，点头同意，但美里伸出小指，说道：“答应我，你们会记住我所说的一切，好吗？”

"Okay," Shinji said.

"No problem," Asuka replied, nodding.  
“没问题，”明日香回答，点了点头。

Both Children used their pinky fingers and joined them to Misato's, and then the woman felt relieved, breathing easy. "Now, come on, you lovebirds, let's finish this before we go," she said before going back to her bowl of yakisoba noodles.  
两个孩子都伸出小指，与美里的小指勾在一起，随后女人感到宽慰，呼吸也轻松了。“好了，你们这对小情侣，在我们走之前把这事做完吧，”她说完便回到自己的炒面碗前。

At almost the same time Kaworu was stirring to life, blinking as he rose from bed, parting away his blanket. For a minute or two he sat on his bed, thinking of the dream he had.  
几乎在同一时间，渚薰开始苏醒，眨着眼睛从床上坐起，掀开被子。他坐在床上一两分钟，回想着刚才的梦境。

_The purification ceremony,_ he thought. _Seems it's a sign that they're getting impatient._  
净化仪式，他想。看来是他们开始不耐烦的征兆。

Kaworu sighed and wondered if he made the right decision. _I know. I've violated my oath, but… I just can't help it. I can't leave and there's no turning back. No, I just made my choice because I love her._  
渚薰叹了口气，不知道自己是否做出了正确的决定。我知道。我违背了誓言，但是……我就是控制不住。我无法离开，也无法回头。不，我做出这个选择只是因为我爱她。

The first thing he needed to do was to take a morning bath down at the communal shower room, so he stood up, took a towel, toiletries and picked up some clothes to wear. As he opened the door, he was surprised to see Rei in the hallway.  
他首先要做的是去公共浴室洗个晨澡，于是他站起身，拿起毛巾、洗漱用品，并挑了几件衣服。当他打开门时，惊讶地看到绫波零站在走廊里。

"Oh," Kaworu mumbled. "I didn't know you're here. Good morning, Rei," he said, before kissing the girl on the cheek and smiled.  
"哦，" 渚薰喃喃道。"我不知道你在这里。早上好，绫波。" 他说着，在女孩的脸颊上轻轻一吻，微笑起来。

"Good morning, Nagisa," Rei said.  
"早上好，渚，" 绫波说。

"What brings you here?" Kaworu asked, thinking of many reasons she would be coming here. But he noted her rather serious facial expression. "Something wrong?"  
"你来这里有什么事吗？" 渚薰问，心中闪过许多她可能来此的理由。但他注意到她相当严肃的表情。"有什么不对劲吗？"

Rei bowed her head and said, "I want to ask something."  
丽低头说道：“我有件事想问。”

Kaworu looked around, before he let Rei come into his room. Once he closed the door, he said, "Tell me what's wrong."  
薰环顾四周，然后让丽进入他的房间。关上门后，他说：“告诉我发生了什么。”

Rei told him of Hasegawa's story about this early morning's incident. Kaworu's eyes narrowed, as if he felt something wasn't right at all. _That wasn't part of the plan,_ he thought.  
丽向他讲述了长谷川关于今早事件的故事。薰的眼睛眯了起来，仿佛感觉到有些不对劲。这不在计划之中，他想。

"Why someone wants her to die?" Rei asked. "I do not understand."  
"为什么有人想要她死？" 丽问道。"我不明白。"

"I don't know either," Kaworu answered.  
"我也不清楚，" 渚回答道。"

"But… Is it a coincidence that you came here, and then…" Rei said.  
"但是……你来到这里，然后就发生了……" 丽说。"

Kaworu shook his head, as if he knew what she was about to say. "No, I'm not part of it, Ayanami," he denied. "Please, are you telling me that I'm involved?"  
渚薰摇了摇头，仿佛知道她要说什么。“不，我不是其中一员，绫波，”他否认道，“请告诉我，你是在说我参与其中吗？”

Seeing Kaworu's disappointment, Rei quickly turned away from him, as if ashamed. "I… I did not mean to hurt you," she whispered, "but I wanted to know."  
看到渚薰的失望，绫波急忙转过身去，似乎感到羞愧。“我……我不是有意伤害你，”她低声说，“但我想要知道。”

Kaworu sighed. "I'm now here because of you, not because what I was ordered to do."  
渚薰叹了口气。“我现在在这里是因为你，不是因为被命令要做什么。”

Rei shook her head. "No, Nagisa, I need the truth. Why is that you came here and then bad things are happening to Pilot Soryu, Ikari and Katsuragi?"  
丽摇了摇头。“不，渚，我需要真相。为什么你来到这里后，对驾驶员惣流、碇和葛城造成了不好的影响？”

Kaworu touched Rei's shoulder and slowly made the girl turn around to face her. He looked morose, looked deeply into her eyes and said, "Listen to me… What I'm going to say will again be a secret between us. This you must know."  
薰轻轻触碰丽的肩膀，缓缓地让她转过身来面对自己。他神情忧郁，深深地凝视着她的眼睛说道：“听着……我要说的将再次成为我们之间的秘密。这一点你必须知道。”

Rei nodded. 绫点点头。

"I was asked simply to replace Asuka. I was supposed to do my job," Kaworu said, "yet it seems that they—the Committee—never told me what they're actually up to. So I don't really know what or who they have put in place here other than me, to harm to our friends, and that now makes me unhappy."  
“我被简单地要求取代明日香。我本应完成我的任务，”薰说道，“然而，似乎——委员会——从未告诉我他们的真实意图。所以我并不真正了解他们除了我之外还安排了什么或谁在这里伤害我们的朋友，这让我感到不快。”

Kaworu bowed down his head a bit. "Now whoever the Committee has sent, I may have to stop them if I can. As for me, I'm _reconsidering_ about my plans. Because of you, I… No, I'm _not_ going to contact Adam for your sake. Because you want to live, because there's still some hope with the Lilim, and because after all the millennia of separation, I don't want to lose you this time."  
渚薰微微低下头。“无论委员会派来的是谁，如果我能阻止他们的话，我会去做的。至于我，我正在重新考虑我的计划。因为你，我……不，我不会为了你而联系亚当。因为你想要活下去，因为莉莉姆还有一线希望，而且经历了千年的分离，这次我不想再失去你。”

With care Kaworu took Rei's hands, and looked up to her eyes. "Ayanami," he said. "I'm sorry, but I want to set things right because I love you very much."  
渚薰小心翼翼地握住绫波的手，抬头凝视着她的眼睛。“绫波，”他说，“对不起，但我想纠正一切，因为我非常爱你。”

About twenty minutes later, they were in the Personnel office at level B-1, where Misato explained it all to the clerk, who then sought verification by checking his email to see if there was any confirming memo regarding Asuka's reinstatement.  
大约二十分钟后，他们来到了 B-1 层的职员办公室，美里向职员解释了一切，职员随后检查了他的电子邮件，看是否有关于明日香复职的确认备忘录。

"Let's see… Oh, yes, it's here, ma'am," he said, before reading the emailed memo from Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, sent in last night. After a minute, the clerk nodded and glanced at the girl.  
"让我看看……哦，是的，在这里，女士，"他说着，开始阅读昨晚副指挥官冬月发送的电子邮件备忘录。过了一会儿，这位职员点了点头，瞥了一眼女孩。

"Miss Langley," the clerk said.  
"兰格利小姐，"职员说道。

Asuka cocked an eye. "What?"  
明日香挑了挑眉。"什么？"

The clerk stood up. "Please follow me to have your ID picture taken," he said and led her to an adjacent room for a two-by-two shot.  
办事员站起身来。“请跟我来拍身份证照片，”他说着，领她到隔壁房间拍了一张两寸照片。

After Asuka had her picture taken digitally, she filled up NERV Personnel Form 320-D, along with Misato's authorizing signature (as her legal guardian, due to Asuka's minor status), and gave it to the clerk, who then had the finished form and other information run through a scanner, and the computer processed them all. No more than two minutes the ID printer spat out Asuka's brand-new ID card.  
在明日香完成数码照片拍摄后，她填写了 NERV 人事表格 320-D，并附上了美里作为她法定监护人的签名（因为明日香未成年），然后将表格交给办事员。办事员随即通过扫描仪将填好的表格及其他信息录入电脑，进行处理。不到两分钟，身份证打印机就吐出了明日香崭新的 ID 卡。

"Here's your new card," the clerk said, handing it to the redhead. "Welcome back."  
“这是您的新卡，”办事员说着，递给红发少女。“欢迎回来。”

"Thank you so much," Asuka said, smiling. Shinji bothered himself to glance at the new card, plastic and colored red, and he nodded in approval.  
"非常感谢，" 明日香微笑着说。真嗣勉强自己瞥了一眼新卡片，塑料材质，红色，他点头表示认可。

"My pleasure, young lady, and oh, Colonel," the clerk spoke, noting Misato's new rank. "Nice shooting yesterday."  
“乐意之至，小姐，哦，还有，上校，”店员说道，注意到美里新晋升的军衔。“昨天的射击真漂亮。”

Misato chuckled, and asked, "How did you know?"  
美里轻声笑道，问道：“你怎么知道的？”

"Ma'am, big news can go around here fast. From the grapevine, everyone knows you beat them off," the clerk said, smiling, as he referred to yesterday's ambush.  
"女士，大新闻在这里传得很快。从消息灵通人士那里，大家都知道你击退了他们，" 店员笑着说，指的是昨天的伏击。

"Ah, that's nothing. Thanks, Corporal," Misato answered.  
"啊，那没什么。谢谢，下士，" 美里回答道。

"Have a nice day," the clerk said, waving his hand, before he watched all three of them leave.  
"祝您今天愉快，" 店员挥手说道，然后看着他们三人离开。

"Have I explained to you about the Human Instrumentality Committee?" Kaworu asked. They were sitting on the futon this time.  
"我有没有跟你讲过人类补完委员会的事？" 渚薰问道。这次他们坐在蒲团上。

Rei shook her head. "I have no idea, but sometimes the Commander would speak of them."  
绫波零摇了摇头。"我不知道，但有时司令官会提到他们。"

"Perhaps I'll fill you out the details."  
"或许我可以给你详细讲讲。"

Kaworu explained to Rei that officially the Committee was composed of five men representing the member-nations of the United Nations Security Council. But in reality those men were part of a 12-member core group of powerful individuals known under the name of SEELE, whose intent was to fulfill the aims of the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. An ancient sect dating back to the Dark Ages, each member was wealthy, immensely powerful, yet most of them are older than sixty-five years old. A nondenominational cabal, they have full control of most of the world's governments, militaries, societies, economies, religions, and of course, the United Nations was already in SEELE's pocket.  
碇解释给绫波听，官方上委员会由五名代表联合国安理会成员国的男性组成。但实际上，这些男性是 12 人核心小组的一部分，这个小组被称为 SEELE，其目的是实现《死海古卷》的秘密目标。这个古老的教派可以追溯到黑暗时代，每个成员都极其富有和强大，但大多数都已超过六十五岁。这个非宗派的秘密组织完全控制了世界上大多数政府、军队、社会、经济、宗教，当然，联合国也早已在 SEELE 的掌控之中。

Except they have problems controlling their runaway creation called NERV, which explained why Kaworu was sent in an attempt to penalize the organization for Commander Ikari's unilateral actions inimical to SEELE's interests, and to realize part of the Scroll's prophecies.  
除了他们无法控制自己创造的名为 NERV 的组织，这解释了为什么碇被派来，试图惩罚司令碇源堂对 SEELE 利益有害的单方面行动，并实现部分《古卷》的预言。

"That's what they want, I'm afraid," Kaworu said.  
“恐怕这就是他们想要的，”碇说道。

"Is there any way you could, or at least we could try to stop this?" Rei questioned.  
"有没有什么办法你能做到，或者至少我们可以尝试阻止这一切？" 丽问道。

Kaworu shook. "No… It's too late; everything's now set in motion."  
渚薰摇了摇头。"不……已经太迟了；一切都已成定局。

Rei sighed.

"However… Even if we can't stop this from happening, it's still possible to _change_ the trajectory."  
"然而……即使我们无法阻止这一切发生，改变其轨迹仍然是可能的。"

"How?"

"They may want it to happen, but I think it's really up to us to decide and to change all this."  
"他们可能希望它发生，但我认为这真的取决于我们自己来决定并改变这一切。"

Kaworu ran his hand over that gray mess of his hair, and said, "You and I are partly of Angelic material, and of the Lilim. We also have this power of manipulating the AT-Field, yet we cannot utilize this out of the fear of compromising ourselves. Now if in case should I am caught or exposed... I have no other choice except to do what must be done, while at the same time I know they're expecting to see what they wanted to see."  
渚薰用手抚过他那灰色的乱发，说道：“你我都是天使物质和人类的后代，我们拥有操纵 AT 力场的能力，却因害怕自我妥协而无法运用。如果我被捕或暴露……除了做必须做的事，别无选择，同时我也知道他们在期待看到他们想看到的结果。”

"What do you mean?" Rei asked.  
“你是什么意思？”绫波问。

"Depending how things play out, it's a matter of deception."  
"取决于事态的发展，这关乎欺骗。"

In the Stockade, Ritsuko was sleeping when she heard the guard calling her while knocking on the door.  
在禁闭室里，律子正在睡觉，突然听到守卫敲门并呼唤她。

"Doctor," the guard said through the steel slits.  
"医生，"守卫透过钢制格栅说道。"

Ritsuko groaned as she tried to open her eyes. Slowly she rose up from her cot and said, "What?"  
律子呻吟着试图睁开眼睛。她慢慢地从床上坐起来，问道：“什么？”

"The Sub-Commander would like to see you," the guard answered as he turned on the lights, opened the door and three figures came inside the cell. Fuyutsuki, Director Hamamoto, and some Section Two agent she could hardly remember, but Ritsuko noted the ID hanging from the agent's suit, and the name on it: Captain Tsutomo Kanzaki. The agent was holding Oda's bagged electronic belongings, hanging from his hand.  
“副司令想见你，”守卫回答道，随即打开了灯，推开门，三个身影走进了牢房。分别是副司令藤木、所长滨本，以及一个她几乎记不起的第二支部特工。律子注意到特工西装上挂着的 ID，上面写着名字：円谷十三。特工手里提着织田的电子物品袋。

"Good morning, Doctor," Fuyutsuki greeted.  
“早上好，博士，”藤木问候道。

"What's going on?" Ritsuko asked, blinking.  
“发生什么事了？”律子眨了眨眼问道。

Fuyutsuki sighed. "I'm sorry to say but there's a very urgent problem we have to deal with, and we'd like you to check this over," he said, referring to the suspect laptop. "I have issued an order to drop all the charges against you, and to be released _immediately_. It's official; no strings attached whatsoever."  
冬月叹了口气。“很抱歉，但我们有一个非常紧急的问题需要处理，希望你能检查一下这台可疑的笔记本电脑，”他说着，指向那台笔记本电脑。“我已经下令撤销对你的所有指控，并立即释放你。这是正式的，没有任何附加条件。”

Agreeing, Hamamoto and Tsutomo nodded in unison.  
滨本和堤摩 nodded 点头表示同意。

Ritsuko looked astonished, mouth agape. "I… I can't say…" she stammered in response, unsure what to say. "I have nothing… But…"  
律子看起来惊愕不已，嘴巴微张。“我……我说不出口……”她结巴着回应，不知该说什么。“我无话可说……但是……”

"Doctor, this is your second chance," Fuyutsuki said, cutting her off. "Whatever mistakes you made down there is nothing compared to what troubles we're trying to cope at this moment. Besides, this is probably your only way to gain redemption."  
“博士，这是你第二次机会，”冬月打断了她。“无论你在下面犯了什么错误，都比不上我们此刻试图应对的麻烦。而且，这可能是你唯一获得救赎的方式。”

"Why me?" Ritsuko asked, feeling skeptical. "Anyone who's into computers could open that laptop."  
“为什么是我？”律子问道，感到怀疑。“任何一个懂电脑的人都能打开那台笔记本。”

"There's nobody else in this organization than you, who's better-equipped and knowledgeable enough to take on any challenge of your caliber. Now, if you know the inner workings of the MAGI like the back of your hand, then it's easy for you to try at least uncover any evidence in this laptop.  
在这个组织里，没有人比你更具备应对你这种级别挑战的能力和知识。如果你对 MAGI 的内部运作了如指掌，那么尝试在这台笔记本中找到任何证据对你来说应该不难。

"I'm doing this because you, in my mind, deserve a little more. Remember also that you're not your mother's daughter, and you're smart enough to know that you can change for the good. Now, if you have any bad feelings in your heart, you'll have to let go of them."  
我这么做是因为在我看来，你值得更多。别忘了，你不是你母亲的复制品，你有足够的智慧知道你可以变得更好。现在，如果你心中有任何负面情绪，你必须放下它们。

The woman pondered on his words for a moment, blinking in a bid to fight off her tears, managing a lump in her throat. Here, Fuyutsuki was now presenting an opportunity of renewal, after Gendo discarded her completely, having expended her talents, and by extension, her body.  
女人沉思着他的话，眨眼试图忍住泪水，努力咽下喉咙里的硬块。在这里，Fuyutsuki 现在给了她一个重生的机会，在 Gendo 彻底抛弃她之后，她的才华和身体都被利用殆尽。

Finally, Ritsuko nodded, her lips slowly forming into a smile while wiping her cheeks. "When I'll start?" she asked.  
终于，律子点了点头，唇边慢慢绽开微笑，同时擦拭着脸颊。“我什么时候开始？”她问道。

"As soon as we bring you to your lab," Fuyutsuki answered, and he offered his hand to her for a handshake.  
“我们一带你到实验室，”冬月回答，并向她伸出手准备握手。

The woman took his with an open palm, and shook. "Thank you."  
女人以掌心相迎，握了握手。“谢谢你。”

"Welcome back," the Sub-Commander said, smiling. "By the way, I apologize for not being able to check on you."  
"欢迎回来，"副指挥官微笑着说，"顺便说一句，我很抱歉没能来看望你。"

"It's okay," Ritsuko answered. "I'm coping well. What if Ikari finds out about this?"  
"没关系，"律子回答，"我应付得很好。如果碇司令发现了这件事怎么办？"

"I'll handle him personally, should he start asking some questions."  
"如果他开始问一些问题，我会亲自处理他。"

Consciously, Ritsuko felt for her hair, and made a mental note to get her tube of Gatsby hair color at the office; she wanted platinum blonde applied on her hair, as if in need of reclaiming her identity.  
下意识地，Ritsuko 摸了摸自己的头发，心里记着要在办公室拿她的 Gatsby 染发膏；她想要将头发染成铂金色，仿佛需要重拾自己的身份。

"Now," Fuyutsuki said as they walked out of the Stockade, "I know I'll catch hell with this, setting you free, but it's important that we must unlock this laptop."  
“现在，”Fuyutsuki 说着，他们走出了禁闭室，“我知道这么做我会惹上麻烦，放你自由，但解锁这台笔记本至关重要。”

"What's inside it?" Ritsuko questioned. "What's going on?"  
“里面有什么？”Ritsuko 问道。“发生了什么？”

Fuyutsuki explained everything about the last 24 hours, before he said, "Oda killed himself, after he failed to assassinate Miss Langley. Section Two agents found this thing later in the killer's van, but they don't want to open it because the data could be erased if they entered the wrong password. So, anything else you need?"  
冬月解释了过去 24 小时的一切，然后说：“织田在刺杀兰利小姐失败后自杀了。第二科的特工后来在杀手的货车里发现了这个东西，但他们不想打开它，因为错误的密码可能会擦除数据。那么，还有什么需要我做的吗？”

Ritsuko thought for a few seconds, and then spoke. "Yes… Just keep Ikari off my back, and now that I'm back, I'll order a ream of cigarettes and lots of hot coffee. This is going to be a very long day."  
赤木想了几秒钟，然后开口道：“是的……只要让碇别来烦我就行，既然我现在回来了，我会订购一整条香烟和大量热咖啡。这将是非常漫长的一天。”

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Cigarettes?"

"Seven Stars. My brand. Bad for you, good for me," Ritsuko said, "and I don't give a damn about the tar and nicotine, or the warning labels on the pack; I know the dangers; I still need it to get my brain working, even if a stick worth of this addiction costs me a day less of my life. _Bellum longum, vita brevis…_ War is long, life is short, quoting a Latin scholar acquaintance of mine, and life is a war."  
“七星。我的牌子。对你有害，对我有益，”赤木说，“我不在乎焦油和尼古丁，也不在乎包装上的警告标签；我知道危险；我仍然需要它来让我的大脑运转，即使这一根烟让我少活一天。战争漫长，生命短暂……引用我一位研究拉丁语的学者朋友的话，生命就是一场战争。”

The old man nodded. "Ah, okay."  
老人点了点头。“啊，好的。”

"However, I swear, once this war with the Angels is over and we live to tell it, I'll kick the habit altogether cold-turkey when that day comes."  
“不过，我发誓，一旦与使徒的战争结束，我们还能活着讲述这段经历，到那时我一定会彻底戒掉这个习惯。”

In his gargantuan office, his hands in the usual position, Gendo was seething within, wondering why Fuyutsuki or even Rei haven't shown up today, and guessing where they are.  
在他的巨大办公室里，双手一如既往地摆放着，源堂内心怒火中烧，疑惑为何今天连冬月和绫波都没有出现，猜测他们可能在何处。

_What the hell is going on?_ Gendo asked himself.  
这到底是怎么回事？碇司令自问道。

Taking immediate action, the bearded Commander loaded the video search algorithm onto his terminal and began searching for their whereabouts. Again the MAGI came up with results and once more he wasn't pleased with the surveillance videos: cameras showed Fuyutsuki walking along with Ritsuko Akagi, on their way to her lab, with Director Hamamoto and an agent in tow; while Rei was with Kaworu in a hallway, walking together to the shower room.  
他立即采取行动，这位留着胡须的指挥官将视频搜索算法加载到终端上，开始搜索他们的位置。MAGI 再次给出了结果，而他又一次对监控视频感到不满：摄像头显示冬月副司令与赤木律子一起走向她的实验室，滨口导演和一个特工紧随其后；而绫波零则与渚薰在走廊里一起走向淋浴间。

He clenched his fist, and promptly he grabbed a nearby telephone, dialed for the Stockade's number. "This is Commander Ikari speaking," Gendo said.  
他紧握拳头，随即抓起附近的电话，拨通了禁闭室的号码。“我是碇司令，”碇源堂说道。

"Good morning, Commander, what I can do for you?" the Stockade commander answered, with a faint tinge of nervousness in his voice.  
“早上好，指挥官，有什么我可以为您效劳的吗？” 看守所指挥官回答道，声音中带着一丝难以察觉的紧张。

"Why is Doctor Akagi out there?" Gendo demanded. "Who ordered her released? Was it Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki?"  
“为什么赤木博士会在外面？” 碇源堂质问道，“是谁命令释放她的？是副指挥官冬月吗？”

"Ah… Yes, sir… Sorry, he did," the soldier answered, almost stammering. "In fact, he signed the release papers, along with Director Hamamoto, to drop all criminal charges against her."  
“啊……是的，长官……抱歉，是他，”士兵几乎结巴地回答，“实际上，他和滨元主任一起签署了释放文件，撤销了对她的所有刑事指控。”

Surprised, Gendo looked furious this time, but at the same time tried to keep his temper in control. "Go on," he said.  
惊讶的是，这次源渡看起来非常愤怒，但同时又试图控制自己的情绪。“继续说，”他说。

"Sir, they wanted her to help in the investigation on the mole infiltration and then the assassination attempt on the Second Children this early morning. They have this piece of evidence, which may help them find the moles and whoever is behind—"  
“长官，他们希望她协助调查间谍渗透事件，以及今早对二号适格者的暗杀企图。他们掌握了一些证据，可能有助于找出间谍及其幕后主使——”

"All right, that will be enough, Captain," Gendo snapped. "I shall talk to him about this matter as soon as he comes to me. Go back to your duties."  
“好了，够了，上尉，”源渡厉声打断。“我会尽快和他谈及此事。回到你的岗位上去。”

The Stockade commander sounded relieved. "Thank you, sir," he said before cutting off the line.  
看守所指挥官听起来松了一口气。“谢谢您，长官，”他说完便挂断了电话。

Gendo put down the receiver, and returned to his thinking position. Inwardly, he felt he was losing control of variables he was supposed to possess like chess pieces on the board. He also hated the image of Keel Lorenz figuratively laughing at him while having a step ahead or two in the Instrumentality race.  
源渡放下听筒，回到了他的思考位置。内心深处，他感到自己正逐渐失去对本应如棋盘上棋子般掌控的变量的控制。他也憎恨基尔·洛伦兹在他面前隐喻地嘲笑他，在人类补完计划中总是领先一步或两步。

As far as Rei was concerned, Gendo decided that for now he will let her do what she wanted, just to find out how far Kaworu Nagisa would act within his manor; he'd like to see him make one mistake, one slip, to expose the Fifth Children's true colors. Only then he would make the first move.  
就绫波而言，源渡决定暂时让她做她想做的事，只是为了弄清楚渚薰会在他的庄园里采取多远的行动；他希望能看到他犯一个错误，一个疏忽，以暴露第五适格者的真实面目。只有到那时，他才会采取第一步行动。

At the Infirmary, they met Natsumi Odani in her office, who greeted them. Misato told her what was needed, and then behind the curtains the doctor began to perform her full checkup on Asuka, who stripped down and sat on the examination table.  
在医务室，他们在办公室遇到了夏美·小谷，她向他们打招呼。美里告诉她需要什么，然后医生在帘子后面开始对明日香进行全面检查，明日香脱下衣服坐在检查台上。

Meanwhile, Shinji and Misato, sitting on a bench outside that office, waited. While she read last month's dog-eared copy of _Good Housekeeping Japan_, picked up from the bin full of used magazines, Shinji zoned himself out with Asuka's iPod, listening to Linkin Park's new album.  
与此同时，真嗣和美里坐在办公室外的长椅上等待。美里翻阅着上个月从装满旧杂志的箱子里捡来的《好管家》日本版，而真嗣则用明日香的 iPod 听着林肯公园的新专辑，让自己沉浸其中。

The checkup took about thirty minutes until Natsumi peeked out of the door and said, "Misato, you may come in and take a seat. We need to talk."  
检查大约持续了三十分钟，直到夏美从门后探出头来说：“美里，你可以进来坐下。我们需要谈谈。”

Setting aside their distractions, Misato and Shinji stood up and walked inside the office, but Natsumi said, "Shinji, I'm sorry but you'll have to wait along with Asuka."  
暂时放下各自的杂念，美里和真嗣站起身走进办公室，但夏美说道：“真嗣，抱歉，你得和明日香一起在外面等。”

Shinji nodded as Asuka, now dressed once more, walked out before Natsumi closed the door. Glum, the girl took a recent copy of a teen fashion magazine from the bin.  
真嗣点头，明日香重新换好衣服后走了出去，随后夏美关上了门。女孩沮丧地从架子上拿了一本最近的青少年时尚杂志。

"What's going on?" the boy asked once they sat.  
“这是怎么回事？”两人坐下后，男孩问道。

Asuka shrugged. "I have no idea what they're going to talk about," she said while flipping the pages.  
明日香耸了耸肩。“我不知道他们要谈什么，”她一边说一边翻着书页。

Once both women were alone, Natsumi said, "I heard about you guys being in trouble again. What happened?"  
两位女士独处后，夏美问道：“我听说你们又遇到麻烦了。发生了什么？”

Misato explained this early morning's events to Natsumi.  
美里向夏美解释了今早发生的事件。

"Why would someone kill her?" the young doctor asked afterwards, blinking.  
"为什么有人要杀她？" 年轻医生事后眨着眼问道。

"That's the same question we were asking ourselves since yesterday," Misato said. "There are suspects behind all this, but there's no definite proof. Not until they finish investigating this matter. But there are three, I believe: the United Nations and perhaps some hostile member-state; the local government, who thinks we're a pain in their ass; and there's a third one. If you're thinking about the International Resistance, forget it; they're only acting as a proxy, as killers for hire."  
"从昨天起我们也在问自己同样的问题，" 美里说。"这一切背后有嫌疑人，但没有确凿证据。直到他们调查完这件事之前都不会有。但我认为有三方：联合国和可能的敌对成员国；当地政府，他们觉得我们很碍事；还有第三方。如果你在想国际抵抗组织，那就别提了；他们只是作为代理人，像雇佣杀手一样行动。"

"I see," Natsumi said. "What's the third?"  
"我明白了，" 夏美说。"那第三方是谁？"

"Can't tell but it's a mystery group. They're pulling strings just about anywhere, and I think they're longer here, long before we're born."  
"说不清，但这是个神秘组织。他们几乎在任何地方都能操纵局势，而且我认为他们比我们出生得早得多，早就存在了。"

Inwardly, Natsumi had a pang of guilt of withholding one secret, after the discovery of Kaworu's real identity. She looked around the room, hoping there was nobody to eavesdrop on them.  
内心深处，夏美因隐瞒一个秘密而感到一阵内疚，尤其是在发现了薰的真实身份之后。她环顾房间，希望没有人偷听他们。

"Is the door closed and locked?" Natsumi asked.  
"门关好锁了吗？" 夏美问道。

"Well, yeah," Misato confirmed, nodding. To be sure, however, Misato walked towards the door, checked the knob and the lock, lowered and shut the blinds, before going back to her seat.  
“嗯，是的，”美里点头确认。为了确保无误，美里走向门口，检查了门把手和锁，放下并拉上了百叶窗，然后才回到座位上。

Natsumi sighed in relief. "Okay, there's one thing I left out, something I should've told you last night, but afraid of doing so. Don't tell anyone."  
夏美松了一口气，叹道：“好吧，有一件事我之前没说，昨晚本该告诉你的，但又害怕这么做。别告诉任何人。”

Misato cocked an eye. "What is it?"  
美里挑了挑眉毛。“什么事？”

The woman doctor pursed her lips. "Trust me on this," she said, her voice lowered, "but… I operated on Commander Ikari's left hand some nights ago, and you wonder why he's wearing gloves all the time."  
女医生抿了抿嘴唇。“相信我，”她压低声音说，“但……几天前我给碇司令的左手做了手术，你现在明白他为什么总是戴着手套了吧。”

"He… He had this Adam creature stitched onto his palm," Natsumi admitted.  
“他……他的手掌上缝合了那个亚当生物，”夏美承认道。

Misato was completely shocked. "He WHAT?" she exclaimed.  
美里完全震惊了。“他什么？”她惊呼道。

"I'm not kidding. I surgically attached that Adam thing, and it managed to merge into his flesh in a few minutes. Personally, it was too fucking scary to watch, and I thought I was in a horror movie. For some reason he didn't told me the details, saying it's all hush-hush, so I was wondering what the hell he wanted to do with that... _squirmy thing_."  
"我不是在开玩笑。我通过手术将那个亚当的东西附着上去，它几分钟内就融合进了他的肉体。说实话，那场面太他妈吓人了，我以为自己在看恐怖片。出于某种原因，他没告诉我详细情况，只说是机密，所以我一直在想他到底要用那玩意儿做什么……那蠕动的东西。"

Already Misato's brain was whirling, trying to put that piece of the puzzle into where it should be. Months ago she caught Kaji sneaking at Terminal Dogma, and blew up his cover, yet he showed to her that the nailed creature before them was Adam. But if Natsumi's tale was true, then what the hell was that white, bloated circus freak she was then looking at?  
Misato 的思绪已经开始飞速运转，试图将这一块拼图放到它应该在的位置。几个月前，她发现 Kaji 在终端教条区偷偷摸摸，揭穿了他的伪装，但他向她展示眼前被钉住的生物就是亚当。但如果 Natsumi 的故事是真的，那么她当时看到的那个苍白臃肿的马戏团怪胎又是什么鬼东西？

As if Natsumi was reading her mind, the doctor took a pencil and a pad, and then went to sketch out Adam's appearance. Once finished, she passed the drawing to Misato.  
仿佛 Natsumi 能读懂她的心思，医生拿起一支铅笔和一张纸，开始勾勒亚当的外貌。完成后，她将画递给了 Misato。

In complete disbelief, Misato stared at the crude drawing on the desk. Three inches in diameter, it was like an Angel embryo but this was completely different, small enough to be contained in the palm. Big eyeballs. A curved spine and a tail. Small limbs. Almost humanoid, like a shrunken Eva. Her mind was making comparisons between this and the strange figure of light she saw just before Second Impact's explosion; it was hard to reconcile both images as being the one and the same.  
米萨托难以置信地盯着桌上的那幅粗糙图画。直径三英寸，它像是天使的胚胎，却又截然不同，小到可以握在掌心。大眼睛，弯曲的脊柱和尾巴，短小的四肢。近乎人形，宛如缩小的 EVA。她的脑海中不断将这幅图与第二次冲击爆炸前看到的奇异光影进行对比；两者形象难以调和，仿佛并非同一存在。

"That's how it looked like," Natsumi said. "When it was first handed over to me at the operating room, it was encased in a block of Bakelite. Nothing to indicate where it came from or who once owned it, except there was a great fuss of security surrounding the damned thing as if it was a sample of the Ebola Virus."  
“它当时就是这个样子，”夏美说道，“在手术室里第一次交到我手上时，它被包裹在一层酚醛塑料中。没有任何线索表明它的来历或曾经的主人，只是周围安保严密得像是在保护埃博拉病毒样本一样。”

_Was this what Kaji died for?_ Misato asked herself. _Was this Adam the reason why all of this existed, the reason for the Second Impact? Was this what we're paying the price for?_  
这就是卡吉为之牺牲的东西吗？米萨托自问。这就是亚当，一切存在的缘由，第二次冲击的原因吗？我们为之付出的代价，就是它吗？

"Are you sure you never told anyone else about this?" she asked, looking at Natsumi.  
“你确定你从未向任何人透露过这件事吗？”她问道，目光转向夏美。

Natsumi shook her head. "Hell, no, and I even signed an NDA. Nobody else until now. I told you this because frankly, I'm damn scared about what the Commander's going to do next with that Adam, so you're the first to know."  
夏美摇了摇头。“绝对没有，我甚至还签了保密协议。在此之前，没有任何人知道。我告诉你是因为坦白说，我对指挥官接下来会对那个亚当做什么感到非常害怕，所以你是第一个知道的人。”

Misato nodded. "Thanks," she said. "Since you and I, even Makoto and the Sub-Commander, and maybe Akagi are in too deep, there's one thing for sure."  
美里点了点头。“谢谢，”她说。“既然你和我，甚至真琴和副指挥官，还有可能包括赤木，都已经深陷其中，有一件事是肯定的。”

"What?" Natsumi asked, perplexed.  
"什么？" 娜兹美问道，一脸困惑。

"Welcome to the Conspiracy Theory Club."  
"欢迎来到阴谋论俱乐部。"

In the lab once occupied by Ritsuko, Maya Ibuki was sweeping the floor, trying to maintain the orderliness of the room. Ever since Ritsuko's arrest, while Natsumi took over the medical side of the department, Maya, as second-in-command, was put in charge of the scientific position Ritsuko had vacated. In the days that followed, Maya took the burden of her role, anywhere from signing requisition forms, to running maintenance utilities on the MAGI, to overseeing tests that didn't require her to be squeamish or able to withstand gore.  
在曾经由律子占据的实验室里，伊吹玛雅正在扫地，努力维持房间的整洁。自从律子被捕后，娜兹美接管了部门的医疗方面，而作为副手的玛雅，则被任命负责律子空出的科学职位。在接下来的日子里，玛雅承担了她的角色所带来的重担，从签署申请表，到运行 MAGI 的维护程序，再到监督那些不需要她感到恶心或能忍受血腥的测试。

Two years ago, despite her top standing in college with a summa cum laude in computer science, she undertook a rather difficult job hunt since graduation, trying to find a suitable position in some of the prestigious scientific organizations in the country. Just as she was hopelessly locked out by the job market, she got an unexpected phone call from NERV, who hired her from out of the blue. That was the best achievement she ever had, and what astonished her further was being given the plum job as an aide to the brilliant and famous daughter of Japan's then-premier computer scientist.  
两年前，尽管她在大学以计算机科学最高荣誉毕业，名列前茅，但毕业后她经历了一场颇为艰难的求职之旅，试图在国家一些享有盛誉的科研机构中找到合适的位置。就在她对就业市场感到绝望之际，NERV 意外地给她打来了电话，从天而降般聘用了她。那曾是她取得的最好成就，更令她惊讶的是，她被赋予了担任当时日本顶尖计算机科学家之著名女儿助手的肥差。

That was an ecstatic feeling then, but now Maya felt the pain of loss, of watching her boss being escorted out of this lab, with handcuffs locked around the wrists. Maya wondered when her boss would be back soon.  
那时是一种狂喜的感觉，但如今真希波感受到了失去的痛苦，眼睁睁看着她的老板被戴上手铐，从实验室带走。真希波不知道她的老板何时才能回来。

She didn't have to wonder or wait any longer, as the door opened without warning. Maya turned around and saw Ritsuko, still wearing light green coveralls and hair turned to chestnut brown. She was also with Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki and Director Hamamoto, and an agent in tow, carrying a plastic bag.  
她无需再猜测或等待，因为门突然无预警地打开了。真希波转过身，看到律子依然穿着浅绿色工作服，头发变成了栗色。她身边还有副指挥官冬月和所长滨本，以及一名拿着塑料袋的特工。

"Doctor Akagi?" Maya mumbled, dropping her broom and dustpan at the same time.  
“赤城医生？”真嗣喃喃道，同时丢下了手中的扫帚和簸箕。

Ritsuko smiled. "I'm back," she said.  
律子微笑着。“我回来了。”她说。

In a total breach of protocol, Maya rushed and hugged her boss, as though a goddess descended from Olympus to perform miracles. She was now crying in joy, laughing, now reassured that once again things would be all right.  
完全违反了规定，真嗣冲上前拥抱了她的上司，仿佛一位女神从奥林匹斯山降临来施行奇迹。她现在喜极而泣，笑着，现在确信一切又将恢复正常。

"Uh, Maya…" Ritsuko mumbled, as she was almost crushed by Maya's embrace. "Can you give me a little slack? Can't breathe."  
"呃，摩耶…" 律子咕哝着，差点被摩耶的拥抱压垮。"你能稍微松开点吗？我快喘不过气了。"

Maya blinked, sniffing, and realizing what she did, disengaged herself from Ritsuko's form. "Sorry," she said, bowing repeatedly before wiping her cheeks. "I got carried away."  
摩耶眨了眨眼，吸了吸鼻子，意识到自己的行为后，从律子的身形中退开。"对不起，"她说着，连连鞠躬，然后擦了擦脸颊。"我有点忘乎所以了。"

"Okay, but don't make it a big deal," Ritsuko said, before she turned to the men present, all three of them looked amused, and asked, "Well?"  
"好吧，但别太在意，"律子说完，转向在场的男士们，他们三个看起来都挺乐的，问道："那么？"

"I'll make sure nothing's going to disturb while you work," Fuyutsuki said, as Tsutomo laid the bag down on the work table in the middle of the lab.  
"我会确保你工作时不受打扰，"冬月说着，将包放在实验室中央的工作台上。

Hamamoto took a breath, and said, "However, Doctor, if you find anything unusual, try to contact us and see what we could do."  
滨本深吸一口气，说道："不过，博士，如果你发现任何异常，请尽快联系我们，看看我们能做些什么。"

Ritsuko nodded, as Maya quickly went to her boss' locker and began pulling out spare clothes. "Okay, it's a deal. No problem with the time pressure either, if you're concerned about it."  
律子点头同意，而真希波迅速走向上司的储物柜，开始取出备用衣物。"好的，就这么定了。时间紧迫也没问题，如果你担心的话。"

"Good," Hamamoto agreed, and gestured to Fuyutsuki that it was time to leave. "Now I bid you good hunting, Doctor. By the way, forgive us for the inconvenience of… arresting you."  
"很好，" 羽本木同意道，并向冬月示意是时候离开了。"现在我祝你狩猎愉快，博士。顺便说一句，请原谅我们给你带来的不便……逮捕你。"

"I accept your apology, Director," Ritsuko said, before she and Maya bowed deeply, very thankful, and the three men bowed back. "Thank you two for bringing me back here. I'll appreciate for what have you done for me today," she added.  
"我接受您的道歉，局长，" 律子说，她和真希波深深鞠了一躬，非常感激，三位男士也鞠躬回礼。"谢谢你们带我回来。我会感激你们今天为我所做的一切，" 她补充道。"

"It's our pleasure, and we'll see you later," Fuyutsuki said, smiling, before the trio left the lab and closed the door.  
"这是我们的荣幸，我们稍后再见，" 冬月微笑着说，随后三人离开了实验室并关上了门。"

Once they were gone, Ritsuko picked up her clothes, and then faced Maya.  
他们一走，律子便捡起自己的衣服，然后面对着真希波。

"Maya, go get my laptop and gear while I dress up. We'll hack this thing," she requested, pointing at the wrapped notebook computer and cellular phone on the table. "And yeah, I want my groove back," she added, before grinning to her aide.  
“真希波，去帮我拿笔记本电脑和装备，我穿好衣服后我们一起破解这东西。”她指着桌上包裹好的笔记本电脑和手机说道，“对了，我还想找回我的节奏。”她补充道，然后向助手咧嘴一笑。

_Now if you could see me, Gendo, you'll be surprised,_ Ritsuko told herself. _You just wait._  
“现在要是你能看到我，源堂，你会大吃一惊的，”律子自言自语道，“你就等着瞧吧。”

Down at the cages, with the cage crew acting on Fuyutsuki's request, Unit-02 was about to be moved, from its holding pen to the Test Facility. By far the procedure isn't as simple as it sounds.  
在笼子那边，按照冬月的要求，笼子工作人员正准备将二号机从它的关押区移至测试设施。到目前为止，这个过程远没有听起来那么简单。

After draining the entire tank free of coolant surrounding the Eva, the technicians first lowered the restraint braces with cables hooked to a gantry, and then they connected the braces to the pylons on the Eva's shoulders, locking them in place with heavy steel bolts to the main binder frame, which would permit safe transportation of the Eva just about anywhere within the Geofront.  
在排空围绕着 Eva 的整个冷却液罐后，技术人员首先用连接到龙门吊的电缆降低约束支架，然后将支架连接到 Eva 肩部的基座上，用重型钢螺栓将其固定到主绑定框架上，这样就可以在 Geofront 内任何地方安全运输 Eva。

Once the entire binder frame held the Eva in place, the technicians started to move the behemoth with the gantry, lifting its 300-plus metric ton mass onto the platform of a maglev carrier, just as large as its intended cargo. Technicians scrambled to bolt and lock the Eva's binder frame to the carrier.  
一旦整个绑定框架固定住 Eva，技术人员就开始用龙门吊移动这个庞然大物，将其超过 300 公吨的重量吊装到与其载货量相当的磁悬浮运输平台的平台上。技术人员们争分夺秒地将 Eva 的绑定框架用螺栓固定到运输平台上。

Finished, the Eva crew chief signaled to the driver to start moving, and the carrier began its short journey from the cage to the test site, connected by a network of outsized tunnels.  
完成检查后，Eva 机组负责人向驾驶员示意启动，运输车便开始了从笼区到试验场的短暂旅程，这段路程通过一系列巨大的隧道相连。

From his office, Kozo Fuyutsuki transmitted several memos to department heads by fax and email: the official confirmation of Misato's promotion to lieutenant-colonel, a scheduled sync test for Asuka and Unit-02, and Ritsuko's reinstatement.  
从他的办公室，Kozo Fuyutsuki 通过传真和电子邮件向各部门负责人发送了几份备忘录：Misato 晋升为中校的正式确认，Asuka 和二号机同步测试的安排，以及 Ritsuko 的复职通知。

The last memo was bound to get Gendo's ire, yet no matter how much Gendo would get angry at Fuyutsuki for taking action on his own initiative, the Commander can't simply chuck him out of NERV, and both of them knew that.  
最后这份备忘录无疑会激起 Gendo 的怒火，但无论 Gendo 对 Fuyutsuki 擅自行动有多么愤怒，指挥官也不能简单地将他从 NERV 中除名，这一点两人都心知肚明。

After Natsumi's admission of Adam's existence, Misato began to narrate the events that unfolded fifteen years ago, which led to the largest cataclysm in human history: her father's expedition to Mount Markham, the disastrous contact experiment, and the devastating rampage of an enigmatic white-lighted figure that eventually set off the explosion, eating up most of Antarctica and generating a mammoth tsunami that devoured most of the world's coasts.  
在夏美承认亚当的存在后，美里开始叙述十五年前发生的一系列事件，这些事件导致了人类历史上最大的灾难：她父亲对马克姆山的探险，灾难性的接触实验，以及一个神秘的白色发光身影的毁灭性暴走，最终引发了爆炸，吞噬了南极大部分地区，并产生了一场巨型海啸，吞没了世界上大部分海岸线。

"…and from there, well," Misato said, "I don't remember how I was rescued, but I remember being examined, operated on, and then put in a room of some sort. For two years, I think, they kept me there without telling me, as I wasn't able to speak a word because I was then in a state of shock."  
“…从那之后，嗯，”美里说，“我不记得自己是怎么获救的，但我记得被检查、手术，然后被安置在某个房间里。我想有两年的时间，他们把我关在那里，没有告诉我任何事情，因为我当时处于震惊状态，一句话也说不出来。”

Natsumi frowned at the rather harsh treatment given to Misato. "Why they do that?"  
夏美对美里所受的严厉对待皱起了眉头。“他们为什么要这样做？”

Misato ran a hand on her hair, and sighed. "They think I'm an irradiated, contaminated test subject. But suddenly they just put me through therapy and counseling, and with some compensation I was returned to my mom. But it took me some time to get used to the normal world until I was able to attend school again."  
美里用手捋了捋头发，叹了口气。“他们以为我是个被辐射污染的实验对象。但突然之间，他们让我接受了治疗和心理辅导，还给了我一些补偿，让我回到了妈妈身边。不过，我花了些时间才适应正常世界，直到能够重新上学。”

"I see," Natsumi said. "It's surprising you were able to get over it…"  
“我明白了，”夏美说，“你居然能挺过来，真让人惊讶……”

Misato shook her head. "No, not exactly. Sometimes things aren't easy to forget, and even after ten years I still had nightmares about it. But… I think Kaji died for this Adam, and damn wish he told me, unless I finally have the answers."  
美里摇了摇头。“不，没那么简单。有些事不是那么容易忘记的，即使过了十年，我还是会做噩梦。但是……我想加持是为了这个亚当而死的，真希望他告诉过我，除非我最终能找到答案。”

"Now what are we going to do with this?"  
"现在我们该怎么处理这个？"

The woman officer looked away. "I just have to plan a way. We can't simply jump on the Commander."  
女警官移开了视线。"我只是得想个办法。我们不能直接冲向指挥官。"

Outside, as she read another magazine, Asuka's mind was thinking of something else.  
在外面，当她阅读另一本杂志时，明日香的心思却在别处。

Once she wears the plug suit again, she would be gambling, the odds very much split in half. Should she fail, then there was no choice except to hand Unit-02 to Kaworu altogether and go home; but if she makes it through, well, she would have a thousand reasons to be thankful for, and countless tantalizing possibilities.  
一旦她再次穿上插入栓服，她便是在赌博，胜算五五开。倘若失败，那么除了将二号机完全交给渚薰并回家之外别无选择；但若能成功，她将有千百个理由心存感激，并拥有无数诱人的可能性。

_How appropriate_, she amusedly thought, _Second Children, second chance… and one can only live twice._  
她觉得这颇为恰当，第二适任者，第二次机会……而人只能活两次。

She thought of her purpose of piloting Eva. Before, she wanted it in order to prove herself superiority, but inwardly to escape the past, to hide the pain and the suffering she sought to erase. She would pilot as if it was an expression of her personal will, yet at a moral cost.  
她思考着自己驾驶 EVA 的目的。从前，她想要驾驶 EVA 是为了证明自己的优越，但内心深处是为了逃避过去，隐藏她试图抹去的痛苦和苦难。她驾驶 EVA 仿佛是个人意志的表达，却付出了道德上的代价。

However, she had a good reason to be here today, not because she wanted to prove herself, but because she wanted to come to terms with her mother.  
然而，她今天来这里是有充分理由的，并非为了证明自己，而是为了与母亲和解。

Asuka remembered a dream she sometimes had, and she turned to Shinji and said, "Thought you might want something from me to know."  
明日香记得她有时会做的一个梦，她转向真嗣说："我想你可能想知道一些关于我的事。"

"What?" Shinji wondered.

"I had this dream for years," she began. "Well, imagine being in a field of sunflowers and it's all sunny and clear, the kind you'd like to hold a picnic."  
“这个梦我已经做了好几年了，”她开始说道，“想象一下，站在一片向日葵花田里，阳光明媚，天空清澈，那种你想要举行野餐的地方。”

"Uh huh."

Asuka ran her hand over the head, and sighed. "I dreamed of being right there, with those sunflowers, and I could hear Mom calling my name, and yet I could barely see her. So I ran towards the direction of her voice, thinking she's there. But I made a mistake; I lost myself right in the middle of the field, and I don't know where to go. There's too many of the flowers, I couldn't find my way out, and even if I shout her name, I could hear nothing, her voice gone.  
"明日香抚摸着头部，叹了口气。“我梦见自己就在那片向日葵中，能听到妈妈呼唤我的名字，却几乎看不清她。于是我朝着声音的方向跑去，以为她在那里。但我错了；我在花海中迷失了方向，不知该往何处去。花儿太多，我找不到出路，即便我呼喊她的名字，也听不到任何回应，她的声音消失了。”

"There's a meaning to this, and you and I know about my past, which is why I'm lost in that dream, and before I could try to finish it, I wake up."  
“这其中必有深意，你我知晓我的过去，这就是为何我在梦中迷失，还未及尝试结束梦境，便已醒来。”

The girl sighed. 女孩叹了口气。

"How you'll end it?" Shinji asked.  
“你打算怎么结束？”真嗣问道。

"I'm not sure," Asuka answered.  
“我不确定，”明日香回答。

"Are you still okay?" Kaworu asked Rei, who was across the table, silently eating her second, but heavier, breakfast of garlic noodles, with buttered bread on the side and orange juice. Kaworu had _sozai_ and two rolls, with a cup of green tea. The Cafeteria's TV was tuned this time to a football match between Barcelona FC and Manchester United, and the patrons were glued to the screen, cheering the players as they kicked the ball across the field, trying to gain a goal while the fans' vuvuzuela horns tooted loudly.  
“你还好吗？”薰问坐在对面默默吃着第二顿、但更丰盛的早餐——蒜香面条，旁边还有黄油面包和橙汁的丽。薰则有素菜和两个卷饼，配上一杯绿茶。食堂的电视这次调到了巴塞罗那 FC 和曼彻斯特联队的足球比赛，顾客们都紧盯着屏幕，为球员们在场上踢球、争取得分而欢呼，球迷们的呜呜祖拉喇叭声响亮地响起。

Rei nodded. She finally accepted much of Kaworu's explanation about his new motives.  
丽点了点头。她终于接受了卡罗尔关于他新动机的大部分解释。

"This time I'm not going to regret my decision," he said, referring to their earlier conversation. "But even if I'm not sure how long I'll keep that, I'll stand by the choices I make as long as I breathe."  
“这次我不会后悔我的决定，”他指的是他们之前的对话。“但即使我不确定我能坚持多久，只要我活着，我就会坚持我所做的选择。”

Kaworu thought of what else he wished to talk about, and he remembered watching _Romeo and Juliet._ "Have you read something other than genetics?" he asked.  
卡罗尔想到了他还想谈论的其他事情，他想起了观看《罗密欧与朱丽叶》的经历。“你除了遗传学还读过别的吗？”他问道。

"Pardon me?" Rei asked.  
"劳驾？" 丽问道。

"I mean, poems or other stories, and in school, sometimes were you been asked to study literature?"  
"我的意思是，诗歌或其他故事，在学校里，你是否有时被要求学习文学？"

Rei sighed. "I do not have any understanding of _haiku_, nor could I write a poem or an essay. I am not very good."  
丽叹了口气。"我对俳句一无所知，也写不出诗或文章。我不太擅长这些。"

But Kaworu already knew this, having recalled a fragment of Rei's memory, in which she glanced at her report card: although her marks in science, history, language and math were excellent, Rei had dismal grades in literature, music and art, and basic calligraphy wasn't easy for her. The Fifth Children shook his head.  
但渚薰已经知晓这一点，他回忆起了绫波零记忆中的一片段，在那片段中，她瞥了一眼自己的成绩单：尽管她在科学、历史、语言和数学上的成绩优异，但绫波在文学、音乐和艺术方面的成绩却很糟糕，连基本的书法对她来说也不容易。第五适格者摇了摇头。

"Maybe I could get you started," Kaworu said, smiling. "I know a few good ones just to get your mind opened, and I'll share everything I know."  
“也许我可以帮你入门，”渚薰微笑着说，“我知道一些不错的作品，可以帮你打开视野，我会分享我所知道的一切。”

"I would like to try," Rei agreed, genuinely interested.  
“我想试试，”绫波同意道，真的产生了兴趣。

Kaworu breathed easy, but just as he was about to resume eating, an announcement broke over from the PA system, initially beginning with a three-tone dong and interrupting everyone:  
渚薰松了口气，但就在他准备继续用餐时，广播系统突然传来一声三音调的叮咚，打断了所有人：

"At Test Facility One, there will be an upcoming synchronization test for Unit Two at ten-hundred hours," the female voice said. "Personnel assigned to sync test operations are to report to their designated stations an hour before the actual test proper…"  
“在第一试验设施，将于十点整对二号机进行同步测试，”女声说道，“负责同步测试操作的人员需在实际测试前一小时到达指定岗位……”

Kaworu and Rei looked at each other.  
渚薰和绫波对视了一眼。

"Well?" he asked. "嗯？" 他问道。

"I hope Pilot Soryu would try to learn what I said," Rei answered.  
"我希望碇司令能试着理解我的话，" 绫波回答道。

"I know what you mean," Kaworu said. "Her Eva won't move unless she opens her heart."  
"我明白你的意思，" 渚薰说。"她的 EVA 除非她敞开心扉，否则是不会动的。"

"That is true."

"So… Why don't we try to watch her?" he suggested. "See if she could make sense out of your advice."  
“那么…我们为什么不试着观察她呢？”他提议道，“看看她能否理解你的建议。”

Rei nodded. "I will."  
丽点头道：“我会去做的。”

About twenty meters away, from his table Sanderson watched the two Children stand up and leave, walking out of the Cafeteria. He'd been watching them for the last thirty minutes, wondering why he was always with the First Children. Perhaps there was something between them? A secret? If so, why?  
大约二十米外，桑德森从他的桌子旁看着这两个孩子站起来离开，走出了食堂。他已经在过去三十分钟里一直观察着他们，想知道为什么他总是和这些初代孩子在一起。或许他们之间有什么秘密？如果有，那又是为什么呢？

Earlier he'd already reviewed every piece of video surveillance footage matching Kaworu's face, using the same search algorithm utilized by Commander Ikari.  
早些时候，他已经审查了所有与渚薰面容匹配的视频监控录像，使用的搜索算法与碇司令所用的一致。

Sanderson drank his coffee, and he knew that the two Children were together most of the time, and it seemed that the Chairman's hunch was right: Kaworu wasn't doing his job. On that conclusion, Sanderson saved the search results to disk, as he would use it as proof of Kaworu's betrayal. Yet he would send this evidence to the Chairman later, as there was more sabotage work to do, to get more proof, and acquire knowledge of the Commander's own agenda.  
桑德森喝着咖啡，他知道这两名适格者大部分时间都在一起，看来主席的直觉是对的：渚薰并没有尽职。基于这一结论，桑德森将搜索结果保存到磁盘上，他要用这些作为渚薰背叛的证据。不过，他会稍后将这份证据交给主席，因为还有更多的破坏工作要做，以获取更多证据，并了解司令自己的议程。

True, the Chairman tasked him to locate Adam, but even after some hard snooping he figured that the Commander was wily enough to hide the three-inch creature. He asked, _Where in the hell is Adam?_  
确实，主席派他去寻找亚当，但即便经过一番艰苦的侦查，他发现司令狡猾到足以隐藏那个三英寸高的生物。他质问，亚当到底在哪儿？

He also discovered that yesterday's mysterious train-brought shipment turned out to be a fresh arsenal of military weaponry: assault rifles, squad machine guns, submachine guns, pistols, grenades, anti-tank missile launchers, explosives, bulletproof vests, and tons of ammunition, all of it US military surplus. Sanderson jumped to the conclusion that NERV had probably anticipated the possibility of a full-scale armed attack, and sought to upgrade their defenses, arm the troops with enough ordnance to fight off an army.  
他还发现，昨天那批神秘的火车运送物资竟然是一批崭新的军火：突击步枪、班用机枪、冲锋枪、手枪、手榴弹、反坦克导弹发射器、炸药、防弹背心以及大量弹药，全部都是美国军方剩余物资。桑德森立刻得出结论，NERV 很可能预料到了全面武装攻击的可能性，并试图加强防御，为部队配备足以击退一支军队的火力。

Sanderson shook his head; this new arsenal was being heavily guarded by a platoon of security troops, and even with a Section Two ID card there was no way he could destroy the cache. Colonel Quaritch would be outraged if he ever finds out that the opposition will be formidably armed to the teeth.  
桑德森摇了摇头；这批新军火被一个排的安全部队严密看守，即使持有第二部门的身份证，他也无法摧毁这批物资。如果夸里奇上校发现对方将全副武装，必定会大发雷霆。

On the other hand, the unexpected sync test forced Sanderson to rework his plan. He had to find a way to put Asuka out of the game permanently, and the Chairman knew that leaving her alive would make it difficult to execute the plan.  
另一方面，突如其来的同步测试迫使桑德森重新制定计划。他必须找到一种方法让明日香永久退出游戏，而主席知道，留下她活口将使计划难以执行。

He had his concealed weapons ready: a small suppressed pistol, a fighting knife, and a Styrette, a battlefield syringe that used a spring-loaded injector and a sturdy neddle capable of puncturing through even several layers of clothing or body armor; and the special syringe was filled with a poison that would induce cardiac arrest within ten minutes.  
他已备好隐蔽武器：一把小型消音手枪、一把格斗刀，以及一支 Styrette，这是一种战场注射器，采用弹簧驱动注射器和坚固的针头，能够穿透多层衣物或防弹衣；而这种特殊注射器内装有剧毒，可在十分钟内引发心脏骤停。

Sanderson was ready, patiently waiting for the opportunity to present itself.  
桑德森已做好准备，耐心等待时机到来。

**Author's Note:** This one took a bit long, as I made at least two major revisions while juggling some real-life concerns. Furthermore, there are some errata in the previous chapters that needed correction. Yeah, and I'm fighting off some writer's block threatening to derail this ongoing project. However, there's a thing I realized while writing: I feel like playing a game of chess, moving the pieces, trying to anticipate the opponent's next move.  
作者笔记：这篇花费了较长时间，因为我在处理现实生活中的事务时进行了至少两次重大修订。此外，前几章中还存在一些需要修正的错误。是的，我还在努力克服试图打乱这个持续项目的写作障碍。然而，在写作过程中我意识到一件事：我感觉像是在下棋，移动棋子，试图预判对手的下一步。

Perhaps in the next few chapters, there will be some familiar sights, but with a different twist; there will be also some action coming, and of course, we'll never expect what's going to happen. As the description for _LW_ implies, "Because some prophecies are not carved in stone".  
或许在接下来的几章中，会有一些熟悉的场景，但带着不同的转折；也将有一些动作戏上演，当然，我们永远猜不到会发生什么。正如 LW 的描述所暗示的那样，“因为有些预言并非刻在石头上”。

Thank you for your continuing patronage, guys, I'll try to come up with some more chapters (grins).  
感谢你们的持续支持，伙计们，我会努力写出更多章节（笑）。

### Chapter 24 Comeback Princess

"_On the floor of the midbrain is the ventral segmental system, that neurobiologists call region A10. Cells soaked in dopamine, certain emotions are processed here: such as the thoughts of two lovers - or a_ parent and a child_. And it is the synchronization of the threads and bundles of A10 that splice pilot and Eva together; to become one entity, to fight. In other words, the_ power of love drives this weapon of mass destruction_."  
中脑底部是腹侧被盖系统，神经生物学家称之为 A10 区。浸泡在多巴胺中的细胞在此处理某些情感：比如两位恋人——或父母与孩子间的思绪。正是 A10 区的神经束与线索的同步，将驾驶员与 Eva 拼接为一体；合二为一，共同战斗。换言之，爱的力量驱动着这件大规模杀伤性武器。

Probably one of the most expensive and secretive pieces of military hardware on earth since the US-built Northrop B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, a product of many minds and disciplines, and a security man's nightmare, the red-and-orange-painted Evangelion Production Type Unit-02 towered at 80 meters, dwarfing everything beneath its four-eyed gaze as she stood idle on the test floor while tech crews went about preparing her for the test.  
自美国制造的诺斯罗普 B-2 幽灵隐形轰炸机以来，可能是地球上最昂贵且最隐秘的军事装备之一，是众多智慧与学科的结晶，也是安全人员的噩梦。那架涂着红橙两色的 EVA 试制二号机高达 80 米，矗立在测试场上，俯视着脚下的一切，技术人员们正忙着为她准备测试。

She was built about ten years ago in Germany, when Project E was picking up pace from the start, the urgency of the perilous situation borne by the Second Impact that prompted its construction in response to the possibility of an Angel assault in the near future.  
她大约在十年前于德国建造，当时 E 计划正从起步阶段加速推进，第二次冲击带来的危急局势促使了她的建造，以应对未来可能发生的使徒袭击。

Apart from Gehirn providing the Eva biological body base and core, all cloned from Unit-00, a half-dozen European contractors were hand-selected for their immense resources, cutting-edge technologies, and experience and expertise with military and aerospace contracts. They all took the labor of creating Unit-02 under great secrecy, but ten other subcontractors who created some of the components from blueprints (under different codenames) never saw the final product.  
除了 Gehirn 提供 Eva 生物体基础和核心，所有克隆自零号机，半打欧洲承包商因其庞大的资源、尖端技术和在军事及航空航天合同方面的经验与专长而被精心挑选。他们都在极度保密的情况下承担了制造二号机的任务，但另外十家根据不同代号从蓝图制造部分组件的分包商从未见过最终产品。

With knowledge gleaned from the construction of Eva Units Zero and One, Unit-02 rectified many of the design flaws and incorporated more advanced subsystems than the other Evas. The design contract stated that since heavy combat against potentially hostile Angels would be expected, Unit-02 was configured and fitted with double the exoskeleton armor plating, a more responsive fire control and actuation system, and a multi-mode sensor and imaging package; to cut costs, a quarter of the components were off-the-shelf systems originally intended for military purposes (i.e. fighter planes, attack helicopters, battle tanks and guided missile destroyers).  
借鉴了零号机和一号机的建造经验，二号机纠正了许多设计缺陷，并集成了比其他 Eva 更先进的子系统。设计合同规定，鉴于可能面临与敌对使徒的激烈战斗，二号机配置了双倍的装甲外骨骼板，更灵敏的火控和驱动系统，以及多模式传感器和成像设备；为了降低成本，四分之一的组件采用了原本为军事目的（如战斗机、攻击直升机、主战坦克和导弹驱逐舰）设计的现成系统。

In addition, Unit-02 was equipped with a spike launcher pod hidden in the right pylon, a box-cutter Progressive Knife, and the ability to use multiple equipment systems, such as the D-Type High-Temperature/Pressure (Magma Diver) Suit and the still-unfinished S-Type Aerial Recon Flight Pack (designed for independent flight without using bulky and costly Neo Point 400 flying-wing Eva carriers).  
此外，二号机还配备了一个隐藏在右侧支架中的尖刺发射器吊舱，一把盒刀式渐进刀，以及使用多种装备系统的能力，如 D 型高温/高压（岩浆潜水员）服和尚未完成的 S 型空中侦察飞行背包（设计用于独立飞行，无需使用笨重且昂贵的 400 型飞翼式 EVA 运输机）。

Once Unit-02 was completed, the US$6.2 billion Eva was hailed as the ultimate in European industrial cooperation, a triumph of science, and a symbol of recovery from the tragedy of the Second Impact.  
二号机完成后，这台耗资 62 亿美元的 EVA 被誉为欧洲工业合作的终极成果，科学的胜利，以及从第二次冲击悲剧中的复苏象征。

Nothing, however, was said for the unspoken tragedy that befell Asuka's mother, who lost half her mind after an apparently successful contact experiment during the final testing phase of Unit-02's development.  
然而，对于明日香母亲所遭遇的未言悲剧却只字未提，她在二号机开发最终测试阶段的一次看似成功的接触实验后，失去了半边心智。

At Ritsuko's lab, the suspect laptop was now up and running right on the work table. The woman scientist glanced at the screen, and sure, it looked normal: standard Linux login screen, ready to accept a password, but it was also personalized with the pornographic picture of the killer's favorite AV idol, which annoyed her all the more.  
在律子的实验室里，那台可疑的笔记本电脑现在已经启动并运行在工作台上。女科学家瞥了一眼屏幕，确实，看起来很正常：标准的 Linux 登录界面，准备接受密码，但它还个性化地显示着凶手最喜欢的 AV 偶像的色情图片，这让她更加恼火。

Days ago Gendo had her arrested for wrecking the Dummy Plug Project, and then slapped a flimsy charge of embezzlement, and now… all it took for her to be freed was this laptop. She wondered if there was an impending palace coup; if so, was Fuyutsuki in charge more often than Gendo today? Well, if that was the case, then good riddance that the damned cold prick was losing control; he must be going bananas.  
几天前，源堂因为她破坏了傀儡系统项目而将她逮捕，随后又以一项站不住脚的挪用公款罪名指控她，而现在……她获释的全部原因就是这台笔记本电脑。她想知道是否即将发生宫廷政变；如果是这样，今天是否是冬月比源堂更频繁地掌权？好吧，如果情况确实如此，那么那个该死的冷酷家伙失去控制真是谢天谢地；他一定是疯了。

She took a sip of her strong coffee and said to Maya, "This isn't going to be very simple. Looks can be deceiving."  
她喝了一口浓咖啡，对真希波说：“这不会很简单。外表可能是骗人的。”

"What about the encryption?" Maya asked.  
“那加密怎么办？”玛雅问道。

"If I see it's a familiar scheme," Ritsuko answered while flipping open her laptop, "I have some written routines to deal with them by brute force, and the MAGI can do just that much faster, I believe; but if this guy put in something esoteric, then I'll be having hell a lot more coffee to drink while I work on it… and oh, one thing: where's Misato? And what about the Children?"  
“如果我认出是熟悉的方案，”律子一边打开笔记本电脑一边回答，“我有一些编写好的程序可以通过暴力破解，我相信 MAGI 能更快地做到这一点；但如果这家伙用了什么晦涩难懂的东西，那我工作时就得喝更多咖啡了……哦，还有一件事：美里在哪里？孩子们呢？”

Maya paused. "I'll call Hyuga," she said and then picked up the phone, dialed for Makoto, who might be here by now. He was on the line and she put him on speaker mode.  
玛雅停顿了一下。“我打电话给日向，”她说着拿起电话，拨给了可能已经到这里的真嗣。他接了电话，玛雅将他设为扬声器模式。

"What is it?" Makoto asked. "I'm about to head over to the Test Facility."  
"什么事？" 真琴问道。"我正准备去测试设施。"

"Do you know where Katsuragi and the Children are?"  
"你知道克图拉吉和孩子们在哪里吗？"

"Well… They're here today. Early this morning Director Hamamoto had them moved here for security reasons."  
"嗯… 他们今天在这里。今天一大早，滨本主任出于安全考虑让他们转移到这里了。"

"I see," Maya nodded. "What else?"  
"我明白了，" 真嗣点头。"还有什么？"

"There's due to be a resync test with Asuka later at ten," he said.  
"十点钟要和明日香进行一次重新同步测试，" 他说道。"

"What?" Maya blinked. Ritsuko had a double-take.  
"什么？" 真嗣眨眼。律子愣了一下。

"She wants a second chance in Unit Two, I mean."  
"她想在第二部队再试一次，我是说。"

"Did I miss a lot of things?" Ritsuko asked, loud enough for Makoto to hear.  
"我错过了很多事情吗？" 赤木律子大声问道，足以让真琴听到。"

"Huh? Hey, you're back!" Makoto exclaimed. "Doctor, what are you doing out here today?"  
"嗯？嘿，你回来了！" 真琴惊呼道。"博士，你今天在这里做什么？"

Relieved to hear some more familiar voices, Ritsuko chuckled as she toyed around with Oda's computer, before she popped out the hard drive from its bay. "Well, someone gave me a second chance, too, so I have to crack open this laptop. Can you give me an update what went on while I was behind bars?"  
听到一些更熟悉的声音，感到宽慰的赤木律子轻笑起来，她摆弄着 Oda 的电脑，随后从插槽中取出硬盘。“好吧，有人也给了我第二次机会，所以我得拆开这台笔记本。你能告诉我我入狱期间发生了什么吗？”

"Sure," Makoto said and he began to summarize all of what happened in the past five or six days. The more Ritsuko listened, the more she was blinking, trying to make sense of it all. She had a bad feeling that the next 72 hours would not mean a peaceful end.  
“当然，”真人说着，开始概述过去五六天里发生的所有事情。赤木律子越听越眨眼，试图理解这一切。她有种不祥的预感，接下来的 72 小时不会意味着和平的结束。

"Doctor, are you there?" Makoto queried.  
“博士，你在吗？”真人询问道。

"Yeah," Ritsuko said. "I believe that you've left out some other details."  
“是啊，”律子说，“我觉得你省略了一些细节。”

"That's true. Can't tell you some of the more interesting parts over the line, but if you want to I could ask Misato to come over."  
“确实如此。有些更有趣的部分不能在电话里说，不过如果你愿意，我可以叫美里过来。”

Ritsuko frowned. She wasn't sure if she could take Misato as a friend this time, but now perhaps it was time to do something right. Maybe… well, just maybe make up for all of her mistakes, and besides, being behind bars gave her a new perspective in life.  
律子皱了皱眉。她不确定这次能否把美里当作朋友，但现在或许是时候做点正确的事了。也许……好吧，也许能弥补她所有的错误，而且，身陷囹圄让她对生活有了新的认识。

"Okay," Ritsuko agreed. "Right after the sync test. I'll have to work on this computer first."  
“好的，”赤木律子同意道，“同步测试结束后就做。我得先在这台电脑上操作一下。”

In his office, Gendo Ikari, in his usual 'thinking' position and seated behind his desk, noted Fuyutsuki's drowsy look as the old man stood before him.  
在他的办公室里，碇源堂保持着他惯常的‘思考’姿势，坐在办公桌后，注意到站在他面前的冬月副司令那昏昏欲睡的神情。

"Where have you been?" he questioned, eyes glaring beneath the amber-colored glasses.  
“你去哪儿了？”他质问道，眼睛在琥珀色的眼镜下闪着锐利的光芒。

"It's been a very long morning, you see," Fuyutsuki said, trying not to yawn, before he explained about the close call on the Children and the ongoing counter-intelligence hunt for the mole, but he deliberately left out his private drinking spree with Misato. Gendo frowned at the first mention of the killer's name.  
"已经是一个漫长的早晨了，你知道的，" 冬月说道，尽量不让自己打哈欠，然后他解释了孩子们遭遇的险境以及正在进行中的反间谍行动，以追查那个内鬼，但他故意省略了自己与美里私下饮酒狂欢的事。碇在第一次听到凶手的名字时皱起了眉头。

"So, he's the one who shot Agent Kaji?"  
"那么，他就是射杀凯吉特工的那个人？"

"Yes," Fuyutsuki confirmed. "He confirmed it right there, before Katsuragi and Kanzaki, and then killed himself. That may sound like a closed chapter, but it's not and we're on yet another, as Section Two's working on the laptop and phone."  
"是的，" 冬月确认道。"他当时就在葛城和神崎面前承认了，然后自杀了。这听起来像是一个已经了结的案子，但实际上并非如此，我们还在继续，第二课正在处理那台笔记本电脑和手机。"

The older man decided not to mention Ritsuko's earlier freedom as she was given free rein to break open Oda's encrypted laptop.  
年长的男子决定不提及律子先前的自由，因为她被授权随意破解织田的加密笔记本电脑。

"Any evidence so far?"  
“目前有什么证据吗？”

"Not yet, but personally I believe that only one party is capable of placing moles against us."  
“还没有，但就我个人而言，我相信只有一方有能力在我们内部安插间谍。”

Gendo grumbled. "I know. Those impatient old men," he muttered, referring to SEELE. "They're showing their true colors."  
源堂咕哝着。“我知道。那些急躁的老头子们，”他低声抱怨，指的是 SEELE。“他们开始露出真面目了。”

"But it's not yet time to raise the alert level," Fuyutsuki said. "Hamamoto needs to do the investigation work quietly behind the scenes, or he'll lose the moles."  
“但还没到提升警戒级别的时候，”冬月说。“滨本需要在幕后悄悄进行调查工作，否则他会失去那些内线的。”

"I see," Gendo said, and then his eyes narrowed. "But you forgot to tell me that Akagi is out there now, and I saw you with her. Why?"  
“我明白了，”源堂说，随即眯起了眼睛。“但你忘了告诉我，现在赤城在外面，而且我看到你和她在一起。为什么？”

Fuyutsuki was surprised, but quickly composed himself and said, "I set her free so that she can help out with the investigation. As I respect her expertise, we still need her services more than ever."  
冬月感到惊讶，但他迅速恢复镇定，说道：“我放她自由是为了让她协助调查。我尊重她的专业知识，我们现在比以往任何时候都更需要她的服务。”

Gendo rose from his seat, seemingly angry. "Have you gone soft again?" he questioned.  
碇源堂从座位上站起来，看似愤怒。“你又心软了吗？”他质问道。

"I have no regrets making that decision," Fuyutsuki countered. "There's still any goodness remaining in her, and as with Miss Langley, I don't want to deny her the opportunity for redemption. If you think about what she did down there," he added, referring to the dead Reis in the Dummy Plug Plant, "by now that's been made irrelevant compared to the impending crisis we're facing, and we must act fast. You want a trump card? I've now given you two, Akagi and Langley, simply to save your scenario."  
“我做出那个决定并不后悔，”冬月反驳道，“她心中仍存有善良，就像兰利小姐一样，我不想剥夺她改过自新的机会。如果你考虑到她在那里所做的事，”他补充道，指的是 Dummy Plug Plant 中死去的丽，“与我们所面临的迫在眉睫的危机相比，那已经变得无关紧要了，我们必须迅速行动。你想要一张王牌？我现在给了你两张，赤木和兰利，只是为了挽救你的计划。”

The bearded Commander said nothing as he sank into contemplation, and Fuyutsuki sighed resignedly. For a minute or two there was silence between the men, before the ex-professor asked, "Anything else you wish to say?"  
留着胡须的指挥官沉默不语，陷入了沉思，而冬月则无奈地叹了口气。两人之间静默了一两分钟，随后前教授问道：“你还有什么想说的吗？”

"You're right, but keep an eye on her," Gendo answered.  
“你说得对，但请留意她，”碇回答道。

"I'll keep that in mind. She knows what she's doing."  
“我会记住的。她知道自己该做什么。”

"Now since you're responsible for bringing back the Second Children, what do you want her to do?" Gendo asked, mentioning Asuka.  
"既然你现在负责带回第二适格者，你希望她做什么？" 碇司令提到明日香。

"I'll supervise her resync test for today. By now she's ready, and the crew has just finished preparing Unit Two. However, should she fail, there would be no choice except to return home, but if she succeeds..."  
"今天我将监督她的再同步测试。她现在已经准备好了，而且工作人员刚刚完成了二号机的准备工作。不过，如果她失败了，除了回家别无选择，但如果她成功了……"

Gendo snorted. "It would be a surprise for the Committee," he answered. "Now if that Eva syncs well with her, then I will have a good reason to respect your words."  
碇司令哼了一声。"这对委员会来说将是个惊喜，"他回答道。"如果那台 EVA 与她同步良好，那么我就有充分的理由尊重你的话了。"

Fuyutsuki had a double-take. "Well, that's quite strange for you to look at her in a different light now. Yesterday you weren't happy about having her back here."  
冬月愣了一下。“好吧，你现在这样看她真是奇怪。昨天你还对她的归来不高兴呢。”

"As you've said about trump cards, this time we need an advantage," Gendo said. "Or at least something to delay them. On the other hand, the Fifth Children must be watched closely, as it seems that he could be going too far."  
“正如你所说，关于王牌，这次我们需要一个优势，”碇源堂说，“或者至少能拖延他们。另一方面，第五适格者必须严密监视，因为他似乎可能走得太远。”

The old man frowned. "Why?"  
老人皱起眉头。“为什么？”

"I ordered the First Children to be careful with him," Gendo said, "while trying to find out about his true intent. Last night they came here together, and then went somewhere without my knowledge. After an hour they left, and on a hunch, I drove there alone, hoping to unmask him yet he wasn't there. Now he's with her again, and so I wonder what they were talking about."  
"我命令初号机的孩子们对他小心行事，" 碇源堂说，"同时试图探明他的真实意图。昨晚他们一起到这里，然后不知去了哪里。一小时后他们离开了，我凭直觉独自驱车前往，希望能揭穿他，但他不在那里。现在他又和她在一起了，我很好奇他们到底在谈些什么。"

Fuyutsuki frowned. "Why do you have to be worried with such a thing?"  
冬月皱眉。"你为何要为这种事担忧？"

"I will not forgive should anything happens to her, for she's the only one left alive."  
"如果她有什么不测，我绝不会原谅，因为她是我们唯一活下来的希望。"

_And so you're bothered right now,_ Fuyutsuki mused, _just because Nagisa and Ayanami could be in love, so you fear that your investment could be in jeopardy._  
所以你现在感到困扰，冬月思忖着，仅仅因为渚和绫波可能相爱，你就担心你的投资会陷入危险。

"Will you be watching the test from here?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
“你会在这里观看测试吗？”冬月问道。

Gendo nodded. "Yes, with the video feed," he answered. "However, just as you said, should she fails, she will then have to leave. That would be final."  
碇源堂点了点头。“是的，通过视频信号，”他回答道。“不过，正如你所说，如果她失败了，她就必须离开。那将是最终决定。”

Fuyutsuki groaned almost silently. "But, who knows, she might prove us wrong."  
冬月几乎无声地呻吟了一下。“但谁知道呢，她或许会证明我们错了。”

"I do not believe in luck," Gendo said. "Only what it takes for us to win before they do."  
“我不相信运气，”碇源堂说。“只有在我们赢之前他们所需要的东西。”

"I see," Fuyutsuki said, nodding. "I'll see you later, then."  
“我明白了，”冬月点头道。“那我们晚点见。”

The older man then pivoted before walking away, checking his watch as he opened the door and stepped out of the office.  
年长的男子随后转身离开，开门前还看了看手表，踏出办公室。

At around the same time a program called KDS Antivirus was being updated throughout the wired world. It consisted of an additional 14,832 lines of programming into the main software, plus 64 virus signatures added to its database.  
大约在同一时间，名为 KDS 杀毒软件的程序在全球网络中进行了更新。它向主软件中增加了 14,832 行代码，并将其数据库中的病毒特征增加了 64 个。

To the public, Kerensky DigiSecure Corporation was one of the largest and highly-respected computer security companies on the planet, whose software are being used in homes, schools, and offices. It is also responsible for issuing digital certificates for electronic financial transactions. But to SEELE, however, the company is a profitable business front, to provide covert hacking and electronic surveillance operations for the organization.  
对公众而言，Kerensky DigiSecure 公司是全球最大且备受尊敬的计算机安全公司之一，其软件被广泛应用于家庭、学校和办公室，并负责发放电子金融交易的数字证书。但对 SEELE 来说，这家公司却是一个盈利的商业幌子，为组织提供隐秘的黑客攻击和电子监控操作。

The seemingly benign program updates are to be used as a hidden mechanism for the most powerful hacking tool in history; included in the lines of code—encrypted, of course—were several target IP addresses belonging to NERV.  
看似无害的程序更新实则被用作史上最强大黑客工具的隐秘机制；在代码行中——当然是加密的——包含了几个属于 NERV 的目标 IP 地址。

After Maya left some 30 minutes ago for her assigned station at the Test Facility, Ritsuko had the suspect hard disk hooked up to her Hardbook with a USB cable, running an analyzer program in an attempt to decode the contents. She was right in figuring that Oda was using an unusual encryption method to secure his hard drive; he was using an advanced file system with double scramble, probably a new algorithm for military use. Even if she let the MAGI scan it, it would take much time, maybe hours, or even days before she could finally recover the data.  
大约 30 分钟前，真希波离开前往测试设施的指定岗位后，赤木律子用 USB 线将可疑硬盘连接到她的 Hardbook 上，运行分析程序试图解码内容。她猜对了，Oda 使用了一种不寻常的加密方法来保护他的硬盘；他使用了一个具有双重混淆的高级文件系统，很可能是军用的新算法。即使她让 MAGI 扫描，也需要很长时间，可能是几小时，甚至几天才能最终恢复数据。

_How could I make a dead man speak?_ She thought, drumming her fingers on the work table. _This is all what he had left._  
我该如何让一个死人开口？她想着，手指在工作台上敲击。这就是他留下的全部。

Ritsuko recalled from a seminar on computer security, that most breakable passwords are the ones that were easily remembered, such as birthdates, a wife's name, a phone number, a popular phrase or the name of a public personality. Hence the prohibition of the use of such passwords due to data theft, requiring anyone to enter unusual passwords with extra characters and memorizing them. In addition, some computer users with forgetful tendencies often leave a scrap of paper with their username and password written on, another cardinal sin in computer security.  
律子从一次计算机安全研讨会上回忆起，大多数容易被破解的密码都是那些容易记住的，比如生日、妻子的名字、电话号码、流行短语或公众人物的名字。因此，由于数据盗窃的威胁，禁止使用这类密码，要求每个人输入带有额外字符的非寻常密码并记住它们。此外，一些健忘倾向的计算机用户常常留下一张写着用户名和密码的纸条，这是计算机安全中的又一大忌。

There were also some other options, such as the use of biometric information to further authenticate the user, with embedded fingerprint scanners. In the case of Oda's laptop, thankfully there was no sign of such a security feature; in that case she would probably need to surgically peel the skin off Oda's index finger or a thumb, and use it as a gory last-ditch solution.  
还有其他一些选择，比如使用生物识别信息进一步验证用户身份，配备嵌入式指纹扫描仪。幸运的是，在 Oda 的笔记本电脑上并没有发现这样的安全功能；否则，她可能需要通过手术剥离 Oda 食指或拇指的皮肤，作为一种血腥的最后手段。

So, as she lit a cigarette and going back to the problem at hand, Ritsuko wondered if Oda had made such a mistake. Perhaps his personal interests could be a potential clue to his password. She was sure that, for example, anime fans have a mistaken tendency to use a favorite character's name as a password; same thing with soap opera fans, music lovers, and so on.  
于是，当她点燃一支香烟，重新回到眼前的问题时，Ritsuko 不禁猜想 Oda 是否犯过这样的错误。或许他的个人兴趣可能是破解他密码的潜在线索。她确信，比如说，动漫迷们往往会有一个错误的倾向，就是用他们最喜欢的角色名字作为密码；同样的情况也发生在肥皂剧迷、音乐爱好者等等身上。

In a cloud of Seven Stars smoke, Ritsuko pursed her lips, thinking hard on that possibility until she remembered the girl's picture on the login screen, on the first time she booted up the suspect laptop. _Was that the password?_  
在一团七星烟雾中，Ritsuko 抿紧嘴唇，认真思考着这种可能性，直到她回想起第一次启动那台可疑笔记本电脑时，登录屏幕上的那个女孩的照片。那会是密码吗？

An imaginary light bulb lit up over her head.  
她脑海中仿佛亮起了一盏灯泡。

Quickly she crushed the butt into the ashtray, canceled the analyzer and went back to plugging the hard drive into Oda's computer, booted up and there was the AV idol on the login screen, whose surname was emblazoned across the navel, just under the breasts.  
她迅速将烟蒂碾灭在烟灰缸里，关闭了分析仪，回到将硬盘接入 Oda 电脑的操作上，启动后登录界面赫然出现一位 AV 女优，其姓氏醒目地印在肚脐上方，就在双乳之下。

_Ozawa._

Could it work? It made sense. After all, Oda must've been a horny sonofabitch, and so she took the gigantic risk of typing in the name and then her finger was poised on the Enter key. A warning on the bottom of the login screen stated that if the user failed to enter a valid password the computer will erase the hard drive contents completely… or so its owner claimed just like a "Beware of Dog" warning sign posted on the front yard.  
这能行吗？听起来有道理。毕竟，Oda 肯定是个好色的家伙，于是她冒着巨大风险输入了那个名字，手指悬停在回车键上。登录界面底部有一条警告，称如果用户未能输入有效密码，电脑将彻底清除硬盘内容……或者就像主人声称的那样，如同前院挂着的“小心恶犬”警示牌。

_Do or die, here goes nothing,_ Ritsuko told herself as she typed the five letters before pressing the Enter key.  
成败在此一举，没什么可犹豫的，Ritsuko 自言自语着输入了五个字母，随即按下了回车键。

Click.

The operating system immediately went to the desktop screen, icons, menus and all. Bingo.  
操作系统立即进入了桌面屏幕，图标、菜单一应俱全。成了。

Ritsuko was relieved. She took a deep breath and then broke into laughter, which lasted for about three minutes before she picked up the phone and dialed up Hamamoto's office number.  
律子松了一口气。她深吸一口气，随即爆发出笑声，持续了大约三分钟，然后拿起电话拨通了滨元办公室的号码。

"Any progress?" the old director asked over the line.  
“有什么进展吗？”电话那头的老导演问道。

"I finally hit the jackpot," Ritsuko said.  
"我终于中大奖了，" 律子说。

"How did you do it?"  
"你是怎么做到的？"

"A grand mistake on our dead man's part. Well, I'll check his documents first, and then scan the whole drive. I'll see if he has some logs recorded, including IP addresses, contacts, accounts, and so on. It's a no-brainer from here."  
"我们那位死者的重大失误。好吧，我先检查他的文件，然后扫描整个驱动器。看看他有没有记录一些日志，包括 IP 地址、联系人、账户等等。从这里开始就是小菜一碟了。"

Hamamoto sounded pleased. "Okay, now call me back if you find anything else significant. Thanks, Doctor."  
浜本听起来很高兴。“好的，如果你发现其他重要信息，请再给我打电话。谢谢，博士。”

Ritsuko smiled. "You're welcome. Later I'll send you anything you'll need."  
律子微笑道：“不客气。稍后我会把你们需要的东西发过去。”

Asuka stood before the Entry Plug, with its seat ready to accept her presence. Just a few meters below, was the gaping maw of Unit-02's spinal cavity, which would receive the plug. She then looked up and saw Misato, Shinji and Natsumi standing by at the control room, and everyone there were busy preparing for the synchronization test.  
明日香站在插入栓前，座位正等待着她的到来。几米之下，是二号机脊椎腔的巨大开口，准备接收插入栓。她抬头望去，看到美里、真嗣和夏美站在控制室里，大家都在忙着准备同步测试。

Like a long-absent actress behind the curtain, about to return to the spotlight onstage, she then closed her eyes and bowed her head, arms crossed, trying to remember everything she learned before, forgiving everyone whom she offended, and hoping that somewhere her mother was listening.  
如同久未登台的演员在幕后，即将重返舞台聚光灯下，她随即闭上双眼，低头交叉双臂，试图回忆起之前所学的一切，原谅那些她曾冒犯的人，并希望在某个地方，她的母亲正在聆听。

She also remembered talking to Shinji earlier, just after gearing up in the locker room.  
她还记得到更衣室换装后，早些时候与真嗣的对话。

"_I told you yesterday that you have the spotlight," Asuka said, now wearing her familiar red plug suit once she came out of the room. She looked calm this time._  
“我昨天告诉过你，你将站在聚光灯下，”明日香说道，她走出房间后换上了熟悉的红色插入栓服。这次她看起来很平静。

"_I know," Shinji answered, who stood before her._  
"我知道，" 真嗣回答道，他站在她面前。

"_For now it's gonna be my turn and I must make up for all the mistakes I did."_  
"现在轮到我了，我必须弥补我所犯的所有错误。"

"_What about your last sync rate?" Shinji asked, sounding worried. "I heard it was near zero."_  
"你上次的同步率怎么样？" 真嗣担忧地问道，"我听说接近零了。"

_Asuka nudged closer to Shinji and stared at him. "Yeah, but I hope I could be right this time, and I want my life back. This'll be my risk. If I lose, I'll accept whatever they'll say and leave, or if I finally get past the forty mark that's when I find forgiveness."  
明日香向真嗣靠得更近，盯着他。“是啊，但我希望这次我能做对，我想找回我的生活。这将是我要冒的风险。如果我输了，我会接受他们说的任何话并离开，或者如果我最终突破了四十分的关口，那就是我找到宽恕的时候。”_

_The girl took the boy's hand. "Whether I lose or win," Asuka decided, "I want to come back to you. I don't care if you laugh or cry, 'cause you're no different from me. And by the way, sorry again for slapping you back there a week ago."  
女孩握住了男孩的手。“无论我是输是赢，”明日香决定，“我都想回到你身边。我不在乎你是笑还是哭，因为你和我没什么不同。顺便说一句，再次为一周前在那里扇你耳光道歉。”_

_Both knew that day, when Shinji said Kaji wouldn't be coming back forever, and Asuka slapped him before lapsing into shock. They remembered the coffee pot knocked out of his hands, spilling onto the table before dripping over to the floor. Next thing Asuka ran to the bedroom and cried, wailing Kaji's name behind closed doors while Shinji cringed.  
两人都知道那天，当真嗣说加持永远不会回来了，明日香扇了他一巴掌后陷入震惊。他们记得咖啡壶从他手中滑落，洒在桌子上，然后滴到地板上。接下来明日香跑进卧室哭泣，在紧闭的门后呼喊着加持的名字，而真嗣则畏缩不前。_

_But that episode seemed a long time ago, a mere memory of sorrow and tragedy.  
但那集似乎是很久以前的事了，只是一段悲伤和悲剧的记忆。_

"_I know… Yet, we've got to forgive and forget," Shinji said, nodding, before he began to kiss her softly, the act lasting for almost half a minute. Just like yesterday at the airport, not like the awkward first time when they bungled it as amateurs, but this time…_  
"我知道……然而，我们必须原谅并忘记，" 真嗣点头说道，随后开始温柔地吻她，这一吻持续了近半分钟。就像昨天在机场一样，不像他们第一次笨拙地像新手那样搞砸，但这次……

"_I wish you luck, girl," Shinji whispered, before he smiled. "We'll be watching you."_  
"祝你好运，女孩，" 真嗣低声说道，然后微笑了。"我们会关注你的。"

"_Thanks, love," Asuka said, saying the word 'love' for the first time out of genuine affection, before she grinned, let go of him and walked away towards the plug platform, led by two technicians who silently watched them for a few minutes._  
“谢谢，亲爱的。”明日香说道，第一次出于真心的喜爱使用了“亲爱的”这个词，随后她咧嘴一笑，放开他，朝着插入栓平台走去，两名技术人员默默地观察了他们几分钟，引领着她。

As the crew chief gestured her to come and get seated, Asuka opened her eyes and recalled the memories of being at her best, the exhilaration of battle, and the rewards of victory. She saw battle with Angels many times, but this time her enemy… no, the only obstacle she needed to overcome was _herself_.  
当队长示意她坐下时，明日香睁开眼睛，回忆起自己最辉煌的时刻，战斗的兴奋和胜利的回报。她曾多次与使徒战斗，但这一次，她的敌人……不，她唯一需要克服的障碍就是她自己。

Once she slid her body into the cockpit seat, and took a deep breath before giving the crew chief a thumbs-up to close the cover over her, Asuka hoped that she would find her mother in the sunflower field.  
一旦她滑入驾驶舱座位，深吸一口气，向队长竖起大拇指示意关闭舱盖，明日香希望她能在向日葵田里找到她的母亲。

---

Up at the control room, Misato was talking to Natsumi, who looked anxious as they stood by and watched the crew below swarming around Unit-02, giving final touches to their preparations. Just behind them the technicians were busy at their workstations, making last-minute adjustments to the systems, double-checking everything. Not far away, Shinji silently stood, waiting and watching to pass the time.  
在控制室上方，美里正在与看起来焦虑的夏美交谈，她们站在一旁，看着下方的机组人员围绕着 02 号机忙碌，进行最后的准备工作。在他们身后，技术人员们正忙于各自的工作站，对系统进行最后的调整，反复检查一切。不远处，真嗣静静地站着，等待并观察着打发时间。

Yet what made this test very special was the intense security: from the beginning while Unit-02 was being moved to the test site, heavily-armed security troops kept guard against potential saboteurs, as a preventive measure so as not to repeat the debacle that plagued the aborted compatibility test with Unit-01 days ago, when a rogue agent quietly disabled the Bakelite system.  
然而，这次测试的特殊之处在于其严密的安全措施：从一开始，当 02 号机被移至测试地点时，全副武装的安全部队就严密守卫，以防潜在的破坏者，作为一种预防措施，以免重蹈几天前与 01 号机进行兼容性测试时因一名叛变特工悄然破坏 Bakelite 系统而导致的灾难。

"It's been long since the last time she was inside," Misato remarked.  
“她已经很久没有进入过里面了，”美里说道。

"True," Natsumi said. "She hit rock-bottom zero on the synchrograph, and that alone is enough to be a career-wrecker."  
“确实，”夏美说，“她的同步率跌到了零点，光这一点就足以毁掉她的职业生涯。”

"Hmmm… Do you still think that menstruation affects performance?"  
“嗯……你还是认为月经会影响表现吗？”

"If I could remember correctly, Doctor Akagi listed down several factors that are responsible for lowered sync performance, whether it's physical, psychological or emotional. Now, contrary to what she claims, in my opinion negative emotions stemming from menstruation periods—and bad childhoods—_do_ have an equally bad effect on sync performance, and so, yes, it does. Where can you find a woman who doesn't have a bad hair day full of cramps while suffering through a period?"  
“如果我没记错的话，赤城博士列出了几个导致同步率下降的因素，无论是生理、心理还是情感上的。现在，与她的说法相反，在我看来，月经期间产生的负面情绪——以及糟糕的童年经历——同样会对同步率产生不良影响，所以，是的，确实有影响。你能找到哪个女人在经期不会经历充满痛经的糟糕日子吗？”

"What about now?" Misato asked.  
"现在怎么样？" 美里问道。

"If a pilot's emotional well-being is up-peak, naturally his or her sync rate would give a positive boost. However, we'll never know until she's inside and all powered up… and, hey, I didn't notice before, but what's with the new rank pins you got? Who gave them to you?"  
"如果一个驾驶员的情绪状态极佳，自然他的同步率会得到积极提升。不过，不到她进入机体并完全启动，我们永远无法确定……而且，嘿，我之前没注意到，但你新换的军衔徽章是怎么回事？谁给你的？"

Natsumi pointed her finger at the pins on Misato's collar.  
夏美指着美里领子上的徽章。

Blinking, Misato tugged at her uniform collar, showing the new lieutenant-colonel rank, and said, "Oh. Nothing spectacular when I got them from the Sub-Commander last night, but I have more command responsibility this time."  
米萨托眨了眨眼，拉了拉制服领口，展示着新晋少校的军衔，说道：“哦，昨晚从副指挥官那里拿到时没什么特别的，但这次我的指挥责任更重了。”

"Congratulations, then," Natsumi said, grinning as she shook Misato's hand.  
“那恭喜你了，”夏美笑着握住米萨托的手说道。

Misato nodded. "Thanks."  
米萨托点点头。“谢谢。”

Just then one of the higher-ranking techs saw Fuyutsuki come inside, prompting him to call out, "Attention on deck!"  
就在这时，一位高级技术人员看到冬月走了进来，随即喊道：“全体注意！”

In unison, everyone stood up and saluted at the Sub-Commander, before he saluted back and said, "At ease, people."  
众人齐刷刷地起立并向副司令敬礼，随后他回礼并说道：“大家放松。”

Once the rest of the control room resumed their business, Fuyutsuki asked, "How she's doing?"  
控制室的其他人员恢复工作后，冬月问道：“她情况如何？”

"Well, sir, I did the preliminary checkup," Natsumi reported, pointing at the screen where Asuka's Entry Plug was ready to be loaded into Unit-02. "In a nutshell, her physical condition's right this time, and on the emotional side, she's determined. I'd say it's a go."  
"好的，先生，我已经做了初步检查，" 夏美报告道，指着屏幕上准备装入二号机的明日香驾驶舱。"简而言之，这次她的身体状况没问题，情绪方面也很坚定。我认为可以进行。"

Fuyutsuki nodded, and then shot a glance at Makoto Hyuga, who held his own report. "What about the Eva's physical condition?"  
冬月点了点头，然后瞥了一眼手持自己报告的加持真嗣。"EVA 的身体状况如何？"

"They made a full inspection a couple of hours ago," Makoto said, reading from the paper, "and then routine diagnostics. No damage or any anomalies since the last activation."  
"几个小时前他们进行了全面检查，" 加持说，从纸上读着，"然后是常规诊断。自上次启动以来没有损坏或任何异常。"

"Good," Fuyutsuki said. He glanced around and made a waving gesture to pay attention to him, before announcing aloud to the crew: "Everyone present, I have something to say before we start."  
“很好，”冬月说。他环顾四周，挥手示意大家注意，然后向全体船员大声宣布：“各位在场的同仁，在我们开始之前，我有话要说。”

Interrupted again, the entire control room crew rose to their feet. Satisfied, Fuyutsuki took a breath and spoke.  
再次被打断，整个控制室的工作人员都站了起来。满意地点点头，冬月深吸一口气，开始讲话。

"Effective today," he declared, "owing to her recent actions beyond the call of duty this week, especially under fire just yesterday, Major Misato Katsuragi, an officer of good standing, is now officially promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. As such, she will be expected to take on greater command responsibilities than ever before, although she will remain as Operations Manager for the Eva program, and therefore still responsible for the Children as their guardian. Ladies and gentlemen, please give her applause of congratulation."  
“从今天起，”他宣布道，“鉴于她本周在职责之外的英勇行为，尤其是在昨天的炮火中，表现卓越，优秀军官葛城美里少校，现正式晋升为中校。因此，她将承担比以往更重大的指挥责任，尽管她仍将担任 Eva 项目的运营经理，并继续作为孩子们的监护人。女士们、先生们，请为她送上祝贺的掌声。”

Promptly everyone clapped vigorously, with even cheers and whistles. Makoto, Maya and Shigeru raised their fists and grinned at Misato, now blushing slightly at this generous display of praise and, thanking them back, she bowed in gratitude.  
众人立刻热烈鼓掌，甚至还有欢呼和口哨声。真琴、麻耶和茂史举起拳头，对着此刻因这慷慨的赞扬而略显脸红的美里咧嘴一笑，她也向他们回以感谢，并鞠躬致意。

With a relieved sigh and a nod, Fuyutsuki gestured to everyone to settle down and begin the sync test, and then he leaned towards Misato's ear.  
福音津轻轻叹了口气，点了点头，示意大家安静下来开始同步测试，然后他向美里的耳边靠去。

"As far as the investigation is concerned," he whispered. "We're halfway through, but first I have set Ritsuko free."  
“关于调查的事，”他低声说道，“我们已经进行到一半了，但首先我得让律子自由。”

Misato looked surprised. "That's good news, but…"  
美里看起来很惊讶。“这是个好消息，但是……”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Yes. I had all those false charges dropped away from her, because a brilliant mind is terrible to waste. Right now she's part of the investigation effort, trying to open the laptop, to see who's pulling Oda's strings, and by now she should be able to crack it. If you still have any issues with her that must be settled, you can try right after this test, and regarding the Fifth, we'll discuss about him later."  
冬月点了点头。“是的。我撤销了对她所有的虚假指控，因为浪费一个卓越的头脑是可耻的。现在她参与了调查工作，试图打开那台笔记本电脑，看看是谁在操纵织田，按理说她现在应该能破解了。如果你还有任何必须解决的问题，可以在这次测试后尝试，至于第五位，我们稍后再讨论。”

"Okay, sir," Misato said, grinning. "Thanks."  
“好的，先生，”美里笑着说，“谢谢。”

Kaworu and Rei were walking to the direction of the Test Facility when she said, "I have a feeling… I am not sure if Unit Two would be able to sync with Pilot Soryu."  
渚薰和绫波零正朝着试验设施的方向走去，这时她开口道：“我有种感觉……我不确定二号机是否还能与惣流驾驶员同步。”

"Why? What's wrong?" Kaworu asked.  
“为什么？有什么问题吗？”渚薰问道。

"I doubt if that Eva would still be receptive to Pilot Soryu. I remember that her sync rate lowered as she became angry."  
“我怀疑那台 EVA 是否还会对惣流驾驶员敞开心扉。我记得她的同步率在她生气时下降了。”

"I know why," Kaworu said. "I know it because I've been inside twice. Her soul retreated, not wanting to do any further. Yes, Eva does also have feelings, and they could sense what the pilots feel."  
"我知道为什么，" 渚薰说。"我知道，因为我已经进去过两次。她的灵魂退缩了，不想再继续。是的，Eva 也有感情，它们能感知到驾驶员的感受。"

"That is true," Rei agreed.  
"确实如此，" 绫波零同意道。"

"However, there's a way."  
"然而，有办法。"

"What would be done?"  
“该怎么做呢？”

Kaworu sighed. "It's a matter of negotiation. I never done this before, but maybe I'll try to talk to the soul."  
渚薰叹了口气。“这是个谈判的问题。我以前从未做过，但也许我可以试着和灵魂对话。”

Rei looked doubtful. "You need to be in the Entry Plug to do it."  
绫波零看起来有些怀疑。“你需要进入插入栓才能做到。”

"I just have to, even if it's a long shot."  
"哪怕希望渺茫，我也必须尝试。"

Now they stood before the control room's door, and two sentries were present, armed as usual. Kaworu and Rei produced their IDs and showed them to the men, who nodded in approval. The doors parted and they walked in, instantly awash with the hubbub of activity as technical staff pored over their displays, making adjustments to the subsystems they were assigned to.  
此刻，他们站在控制室的门前，两名哨兵如常持枪守卫。渚薰和绫波零出示了他们的身份证件，守卫点头表示认可。门缓缓打开，他们步入其中，立刻被忙碌的氛围所包围，技术人员们正专注地盯着屏幕，调整着各自负责的子系统。

First the two Children looked up to one of the plug video feeds, with Asuka sitting right in the cockpit, before they saw Shinji and the others standing there, watching, and then both Children walked towards them. Just then Shinji turned around, smiled and said, "Hey! Haven't seen you two since yesterday. Where have you been?"  
两位少年首先抬头看向其中一个插入栓视频画面，画面中明日香正坐在驾驶舱内，随后他们看到了真嗣和其他人站在那里观看，于是两位少年走向他们。就在这时，真嗣转过身来，微笑着说：“嘿！昨天之后就没见到你们了。你们去哪儿了？”

Shinji's outburst grabbed the attention of the adults present, who pivoted and gave the other two Children a surprised look. In Misato's case she merely gaped and blinked.  
真嗣的爆发引起了在场大人们的注意，他们转过身来，对另外两个孩子投以惊讶的目光。在美里看来，她只是目瞪口呆，眨了眨眼。

Both Children bowed their heads, before Kaworu grinned and Rei produced a soft smile. "Sorry, we're been out of the picture for most of the time after you and Asuka left that afternoon… and uh, good morning, Misato, and good morning, Sub-Commander."  
两个孩子都低下了头，随后薰露出了微笑，而绫波则轻轻一笑。“抱歉，自从那天下午你和明日香离开后，我们大部分时间都不在……呃，早上好，美里，还有早上好，副司令。”

Misato nodded. "Good morning to you," both officers answered in unison.  
美里点了点头。“早上好。”两位军官异口同声地回答。

"We heard you got into trouble," Kaworu said. "But we got only bits and pieces of it."  
"我们听说你遇到了麻烦，"渚薰说。"但我们只听到了一些零星片段。"

"Right. Again, where have you been yesterday?" Misato asked both Children, as Fuyutsuki listened.  
"没错。再说一遍，你们昨天去哪儿了？"美里问两位少年，副司令冬月在一旁听着。"

"Well… Rei and I went out to her home, stayed there and talked, while you were…" Kaworu trailed off, trying to say the right words.  
"嗯……我和绫波去了她家，待在那里聊天，而你们当时……"渚薰话说到一半，试图找到合适的词句。"

"Ambushed," Misato corrected him. "In almost twenty-four hours trouble paid us a visit twice, dodged bullets, and I still don't know who the hell were trying to kill us. But I'll leave all that to tell you more of the details later, so…" the woman hesitated, "Tell me, what's going on with you two? Something serious?"  
"是'突袭'，" 美里纠正他。"不到二十四小时麻烦就找上门两次，我们躲过子弹，可我到现在还不知道到底是谁想杀我们。不过这些细节我稍后再跟你细说，所以……" 女人犹豫了一下，"告诉我，你们俩怎么了？有什么严重的事吗？"

"Let's say we… We just got to know each other on an intimate level," Kaworu said.  
"这么说吧，我们……刚刚在亲密层面上了解了彼此，" 渚薰说道。"

Shinji was confused with Kaworu's cryptic response. "What do you mean?"  
真嗣对渚薰的隐晦回答感到困惑。"你这是什么意思？"

Kaworu and Rei looked at each other, guessing how they could explain it in simple terms how they finally hit it off, before the Fifth Children told them the truth by simply clasping his hand with Rei's. Their companions noted the quiet gesture, and the astonishing answer dawned upon them.  
渚薰和绫波零互视一眼，思索着如何用简单的语言解释他们最终是如何走到一起的，直到第五适格者简单地握住绫波的手，向他们揭示了真相。他们的同伴注意到了这个无声的动作，随之而来的惊人答案在他们心中渐渐明朗。

They were in love.  
他们相爱了。

"I was right," Fuyutsuki said, breaking the silence and then the old man shook his head and smiled as if he was a proud father. "We'll have to make this a top secret," he quipped. But inwardly he wondered what the consequences would be like now that these two enigmatic Children are having a serious relationship.  
“我说对了，”冬月说，打破了沉默，然后这位老人摇了摇头，微笑着，仿佛是一位自豪的父亲。“我们得把这个当作最高机密，”他打趣道。但内心深处，他不禁思考起这两个神秘的适格者开始认真交往后会带来怎样的后果。

The countdown timer right on the main display now told them they were less than five minutes away from activation, and Fuyutsuki took a breath, his mood turning to business-serious.  
主显示屏上的倒计时器现在告诉他们，距离激活不到五分钟了，冬月深吸一口气，心情转为严肃认真。

"Let's get on with the test first," he said. "We'll tell stories later after this one."  
“我们先进行测试，”他说，“测试结束后再讲故事。”

---

Still waiting for the countdown, sitting in the cockpit, Asuka zoned out for a moment, thinking the last time she was in the plug, on her failed sortie.  
仍在等待倒计时，坐在驾驶舱里，明日香一时走神，想起了上次她失败出击时在插入栓里的情景。

At that time, they launched her up, then Misato ordered her to try to move out and go shoot at the Angel that was about to kill Rei and Unit-00. Once they released the restraints, Asuka was shocked that Unit-02 couldn't move at all, and she checked her sync rate: _zero percent_, barely enough to sync yet too inadequate to move her Eva an inch; the supreme object of her expression of ultimate power became an 80-meter statue, and the humiliation was final.  
那时，他们将她弹射出去，随后美里命令她尝试移动并射击即将杀死绫波和零号机的使徒。一旦解除束缚，明日香震惊地发现二号机完全无法动弹，她检查了自己的同步率：零百分比，勉强能够同步却不足以移动她的 EVA 分毫；她展现终极力量的至高对象变成了一尊 80 米高的雕像，而这份屈辱是彻底的。

Just before they pulled her back, she momentarily saw Rei being assaulted by that rope-like Angel, boring into Unit-00's chest, seeking for the core.  
就在他们将她拉回之前，她短暂地看到了绫波被那绳索般的使徒攻击，钻入零号机的胸膛，寻找核心。

Asuka closed her eyes, and thought of her past rivalry with the First Children; that girl was competition then, an affront to her superiority, a doll with a porcelain mask, seemingly having the ear of the Commander.  
明日香闭上眼睛，回想起与第一适格者的过往竞争；那个女孩曾是她的对手，是对她优越感的冒犯，一个戴着瓷面具的玩偶，似乎得到了司令官的青睐。

But Rei was no different from her despite their opposite extremes of personality, acknowledging weaknesses that she never revealed before, and Rei was probably struggling within to free herself of the strings that bound her to command.  
但丽与她并无二致，尽管性格极端相反，却也承认了她从未展现过的弱点，而丽或许也在内心挣扎，试图挣脱束缚她的命令之线。

Now Asuka looked up and saw the other three Children watching her. Asuka thought of what they were feeling this time, what was in their minds. Perhaps they came either to be witnesses or as judges, to see if she learned something in the long ordeal of being in bed.  
此刻，明日香抬头看见其他三位适格者正注视着她。明日香思索着他们此刻的心情，他们心中所想。或许他们来此或是作为见证者，或是作为评判者，想看看她在长时间的卧床煎熬中是否有所领悟。

"Wish me luck," Asuka whispered, and then she heard the klaxons, a warning to prepare for the sync test.  
“祝我好运。”明日香低语道，随即她听到了警报声，那是准备进行同步测试的警告。

---

Fuyutsuki now turned his attention to the technicians under his responsibility, and the atmosphere took on the critical intensity of a rocket launch.  
冬月现在将注意力转向他负责的技术人员，气氛变得如同火箭发射般紧张关键。

"Each one of you, check and confirm yourselves for systems go," he ordered them, as he held a clipboard with a readiness checklist.  
“你们每个人，检查并确认系统准备就绪，”他命令道，手中拿着一个准备清单的夹板。

"Life Support," Fuyutsuki called out.  
“生命维持系统，”冬月呼叫道。

"It's a go," a tech replied.  
"可以开始了," 一位技术人员回答道。

"Pilot Monitoring."

"A confirmed go," another chimed.  
"确认可以开始," 另一位补充道。

"Synapse Control."

"Ready to go, sir."  
"准备好了，先生。"

This went on as each of the techs verified their readiness status: Eva systems monitoring, electrical supply and control, LCL supply and control, plug subsystems control, communications, data linkage, security restraint control, emergency backup systems, recording, damage control, and so on.  
这一过程持续进行，每位技术人员都确认了自己的准备状态：EVA 系统监控、电力供应与控制、LCL 供应与控制、插头子系统控制、通信、数据链接、安全约束控制、紧急备用系统、记录、损伤控制等等。

Once done with the list, Fuyutsuki cleared his throat. "Ibuki, start up the systems," he commanded.  
完成清单后，冬月清了清嗓子。“伊吹，启动系统，”他命令道。

"Yes sir," Ibuki answered as she went busy on the keyboard.  
“是，长官，”伊吹回答着，开始在键盘上忙碌起来。

"Excellent," Fuyutsuki remarked before he glanced up at the banks of video feeds. "Are you ready now?" he asked Asuka.  
"很好，" 冬月评论道，随即抬头看向一排排视频监控。"你现在准备好了吗？" 他问明日香。

"I'm ready, sir," she answered, the girl looked determined to return.  
"我准备好了，长官，" 她回答道，女孩看起来决心重返战场。

"Good. Lieutenant, prepare to throw the switches and insert the plug," Fuyutsuki directed, hearing the whines of the actuators and pistons as they inserted the plug into the red warrior's back and sealed shut, before the injector pumped thousands of liters of LCL into the plug.  
"好。中尉，准备扳动开关并插入插头，" 冬月指示道，听到执行器和活塞的嗡鸣声，它们将插头插入红色战士的背后并密封，随后注射器注入了数千升的 LCL。

As the plug was being filled, Asuka began to breathe in the oxygenated liquid, the familiarity of its presence in her lungs slowly coming back to her.  
随着插入栓被注满，明日香开始吸入含氧液体，那种熟悉的感觉在她肺中逐渐回归。

"Initial plug depth has been set at 0.105, plug data has been reprogrammed for Langley. LCL pressure, temperature and oxygenation are at nominal levels. Main power is ready to be activated," Shigeru reported, reading off his display.  
“初始插入深度设定为 0.105，插入栓数据已重新编程以适应兰利。LCL 压力、温度和氧合水平均处于标准状态。主电源已准备好激活，”四郎报告道，从显示屏上读取信息。

"Just right. Now connect and activate the main power circuits," Fuyutsuki ordered as they kept an eye on several consoles showing the full status of every system and sensor in Unit-02, before Shigeru threw the huge red switches forward.  
“正好。现在连接并激活主电源电路，”冬月命令道，同时密切关注着显示二号机所有系统和传感器全面状态的多个控制台，随后四郎向前推动了巨大的红色开关。

Electricity immediately surged into the umbilical cable on the back of Unit-02 with a growing hum. The huge of readouts and indicators on the displays began to show how far all the figures were climbing.  
电流立刻涌入二号机背后的脐带电缆，发出逐渐增强的嗡鸣声。显示屏上巨大的读数和指示器开始显示所有数值的攀升程度。

"Voltage increasing to the critical point... 0.5... 0.2... approaching towards nominal levels," Maya reported.  
"电压提升至临界点...0.5...0.2...接近额定水平。" 真希波报告道。

---

While everyone was focused on Unit-02, Kaworu quietly slid his hand onto Rei's and clasped gently. He sighed, praying that she could make it through.  
当所有人都专注于二号机时，渚薰悄悄地将手滑向绫波的手，轻轻握住。他叹息着，祈祷她能挺过去。

Rei almost had the same thoughts, wishing her advice be made manifest.  
丽几乎也有同样的想法，希望她的建议能立即实现。

At the same time, from his office, Gendo Ikari watched everything on his monitor, the video feed being streamed right to him. It was irrelevant for him whether Asuka makes it or not. All he needed was anyone to follow his orders down to the letter, to ensure that anything must go according to plan.  
与此同时，在办公室里，碇源堂通过他的显示器观察着一切，视频信号直接传输到他那里。对他来说，是否是明日香成功与否并不重要。他需要的只是任何人都能严格遵守他的命令，确保一切必须按计划进行。

As her search program was turning up hundreds of files in Oda's laptop, Ritsuko turned to her computer, opened a media player program, and via network selected the video stream to tune into the synchronization test live feed.  
当她的搜索程序在加持的笔记本电脑中找到数百个文件时，律子转向她的电脑，打开了一个媒体播放器程序，并通过网络选择了视频流，调入同步测试的实时直播。

But Shinji and Misato nervously held their breath, wondering what would happen next. Asuka was now in the spotlight and onstage, ready to perform once more before a judging audience.  
但真嗣和美里紧张地屏住呼吸，想知道接下来会发生什么。此刻，明日香成为了焦点，站在舞台上，准备再次在评审团面前表演。

---

"Go for second stage, ladies and gentlemen," Fuyutsuki ordered.  
“进入第二阶段，女士们先生们，”冬月命令道。

"Synapses inserted. Junction in progress," Shigeru reported.  
"突触已接入。连接正在进行中，" 四郎报告道。

"Pulses transmitted. All circuits are operational. No problems with the initial contacts, all confirmed." Maya announced again.  
“脉冲已发送。所有电路运行正常。初始接触无问题，全部确认。” 真耶再次宣布。

"Power has been transmitted to the upper muscle group and is active. No problems with the nerve links, sir," Shigeru said.  
“力量已传输至上部肌肉群并处于激活状态。神经连接无异常，长官。” 四郎说道。

In the plug, Asuka was rushing through a series of rainbows, synaptic fireworks blazing the walls, along with flashes of light and sparks, towards eventual synchronization. It looked as if she was being pulled into a wormhole, like Alice dropping down the rabbit's warren into Wonderland.  
在插入栓内，明日香正穿梭于一系列彩虹之中，突触烟火在墙壁上闪耀，伴随着光亮和火花，朝着最终的同步前进。看起来她仿佛被拉入了一个虫洞，就像爱丽丝掉进兔子洞进入奇境一样。

Maya nodded in latent satisfaction. "Up to 2550 link points on the list here also all accounted for," she added, before the indicator lights broke through the Absolute Borderline. "She has cleared the line, sir."  
玛雅微微点头，流露出潜在的满意。“这里列出的 2550 个连接点也全部确认无误，”她补充道，随即指示灯突破了绝对边界线。“她已经越过了界限，长官。”

"Okay, Lieutenant. Now I need the A-10 contacts on initial," Fuyutsuki ordered as he saw everything in the green, before he looked at Asuka again.  
"好的，中尉。现在我需要 A-10 的初始接触联系，"冬月命令道，他看到一切正常后，再次看向明日香。

"Roger, connecting the A-10 now," Ibuki told back as she typed out a string of commands on the keyboard. The display then showed Asuka's A-10 being interfaced into Unit-02's A-10, until it indicated a successful hookup.  
"收到，正在连接 A-10，"伊吹回答道，她在键盘上输入了一串命令。显示屏随即显示明日香的 A-10 正在与二号机的 A-10 进行接口，直到显示连接成功。

"The connection to the A-10 nerve is operational," Makoto confirmed.  
"A-10 神经连接已正常运作，"真希波确认道。

There was now the system control configuration being run, every variable adjusted to Asuka's profile and personal physiological data.  
现在运行的是系统控制配置，每个变量都根据明日香的个人生理数据进行了调整。

"Eva Unit Two system control switched to Japanese as primary thought language. All initial contacts are set," Ibuki noted, before she checked the display for the sync rate. "The mutual lines are connected. Synchronization rate is…"  
“EVA 二号机系统控制已切换为日语作为主要思维语言。所有初始接触已设定，”伊吹报告道，随后她检查了同步率显示。“互连线路已接通。同步率是……”

Maya did a double-take, disbelief and disappointment crossing her face.  
玛雅愣了一下，脸上闪过难以置信和失望的神情。

"_Zero_?" she muttered, and at the same time the rest of the entire control room gasped in dismay and, in frustration, Fuyutsuki banged his fist on the console. He couldn't believe it.  
“零？”她喃喃道，与此同时，整个控制室的人都惊愕地倒吸一口凉气，而福音津则懊恼地一拳砸在控制台上。他简直不敢相信。

---

Suddenly the whole plug blacked out, except for the small auxiliary lights recessed into the plug. Whatever hopes that Asuka had for a comeback were instantly dashed, and the girl was shocked for a few moments before she mumbled, "What the…?"  
突然间，整个插入栓陷入黑暗，除了嵌入式的小辅助灯还亮着。明日香本以为还有翻盘的希望，瞬间破灭了，她愣了几秒后喃喃自语：“搞什么……？”

Asuka shook the butterfly controls. No reaction. Only silence, excruciating silence, the whole plug no more silent than a sarcophagus.  
明日香摇了摇蝴蝶控制器。毫无反应。只有死寂，令人窒息的死寂，整个插入栓静得如同石棺一般。

"Come on… Please." "来吧…求你了。"

The girl's eyes were darting left and right, still wondering what the hell happened.  
女孩的眼睛左右扫视，仍在疑惑到底发生了什么。

"Why?" Asuka pleaded. "I want to change! I want to be a better person… Please, I want to show you, sync with me! I want to find you in the field, can't you remember that? Mama! Help me! Forgive me! I even prayed for you, so give me a chance! MAMA! I'm not a piece of junk! Please!"  
"为什么？" 明日香恳求道。"我想改变！我想成为一个更好的人…求你了，我想向你展示，与我同步！我想在战场上找到你，你不能记起来吗？妈妈！帮帮我！原谅我！我甚至为你祈祷了，所以给我一个机会吧！妈妈！我不是废物！求你了！"

Tears began to float away from Asuka's eyes, as if all chances of redemption were lost. She fell back to her seat, utterly defeated as the girl sobbed.  
泪水开始从明日香的眼中飘散，仿佛所有的救赎机会都已失去。她颓然坐回座位，彻底被击败，女孩啜泣着。

---

Everyone at the control room heard Asuka's anguish, and Misato gritted her teeth in frustration. "Asuka, you have to hang on!" she said, watching the girl from the video feed. "We're gonna try everything just to get you back on track."  
控制室里的每个人都听到了明日香的痛苦，美里咬紧牙关，感到无比沮丧。“明日香，你一定要坚持住！”她看着视频画面中的女孩说道，“我们会尽一切努力让你重回正轨。”

Agonized, Shinji grasped his head and bent down, as if partly responsible for the girl's failure.  
痛苦中，真嗣抱头弯腰，仿佛自己也对女孩的失败负有部分责任。

"Why it has to be like this?" Asuka retorted, and the girl went back to her crying.  
“为什么非得这样？”明日香反驳道，女孩又回到了哭泣中。

Just a distance away from Misato, Kaworu was distraught yet he and Rei knew it's happening now. "I think you're right," he said, referring to her earlier doubts.  
就在离美里不远的地方，渚薰心烦意乱，但他和绫波都知道事情正在发生。“我想你是对的，”他说，指的是她之前的疑虑。

"I do not want to see her feel disappointed," Rei answered.  
“我不想看到她失望，”绫波回答道。

Kaworu nodded, and then he closed his eyes, concentrating, focused upon Unit-02. In his mind he imagined rushing through a vortex of images until he stood before her soul within the core, bent into a fetal position, shaking and crying, still clutching the rag doll in her embrace.  
渚薰点点头，然后闭上眼睛，全神贯注于二号机。在他的脑海中，他想象着自己穿梭于一连串的影像旋涡，直到站在核心中她的灵魂面前，她蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，颤抖着哭泣，依然紧抱着怀中的破布娃娃。

"_Why do you have to be afraid?" Kaworu asked Kyoko. "Why you couldn't give her a chance?"_  
“你为什么要害怕呢？”渚薰问京子。“为什么你不给她一个机会呢？”

"_I… I can't," Kyoko whispered between sobs. "She still hates me."_  
“我……我做不到，”京子在啜泣间低声说。“她仍然恨我。”

_Kaworu sighed. "But she has changed," he said. "Can't you see it?"  
渚薰叹了口气。“但她已经改变了，”他说，“你难道看不出来吗？”_

"_I… It's my fault that I lost half of myself," Kyoko admitted, "that the body I let go of from the plug a long time ago wasn't me; that other me has gone mad, turned my daughter against me, while my husband betrayed me. And when she came to pilot me, I thought she understood what I am, but instead…"_  
“我……我失去了自我的一半，这是我的错，”绫波零承认道，“那个很久以前从插入栓中放手的身体不是我；另一个我疯了，让我女儿与我反目，而我的丈夫背叛了我。当她来驾驶我时，我以为她理解我是什么，但结果……”

"_She's not what you think of anymore," Kaworu countered. "She has forgiven everyone, and she's willing to forgive you. To be sure, she has accepted what she truly is, finally realizing that denying the past had almost cost her life."_  
“她不再是你的想象了，”渚薰反驳道，“她已经原谅了所有人，并且愿意原谅你。可以肯定的是，她终于接受了自己真正的身份，意识到否认过去几乎让她丧命。”

_Kyoko said nothing. 绫子什么也没说。_

"_Asuka wants to live, but understand that your daughter needs to prove that she can be much more of a better person than she ever was before. Now if you truly love your daughter, then you must show her your affection in a way you thought to be impossible. Asuka's ready now; she wants to try again; she asks for your love and needs to make peace with you. It's time to let go and look towards the future. Be not afraid."_  
“明日香想要活下去，但你要明白，你的女儿需要证明她能成为一个比以往任何时候都更好的人。现在，如果你真的爱你的女儿，那么你必须以你认为不可能的方式向她展示你的爱。明日香已经准备好了；她想再试一次；她请求你的爱，并需要与你和解。是时候放手，展望未来了。不要害怕。”

_The older woman blinked, trying to make sense of Kaworu's plea, pondering for what felt like an eternity, before the memories of the sunflower field came back to her. Kyoko slowly stood up onto her feet, and then she lifted up the doll over her head, before hugging it closer to her chest.  
年长的女人眨了眨眼，试图理解薰的恳求，沉思良久，仿佛经历了一个永恒，直到向日葵田的记忆再次涌上心头。绫子缓缓站起身来，然后她将玩偶举过头顶，紧紧抱在胸前。_

"_What can I do?" Kyoko asked, calm this time._  
"我能做些什么？" 绫子这次平静地问道。

_Kaworu smiled in gratitude. "Be with her right now. Look into her heart and mind this time, and it doesn't take too much to show that you truly care."  
薰微笑着表示感谢。"现在就陪在她身边。这次深入她的内心和思想，不需要太多就能表现出你真心的关怀。"_

---

"Why?" Asuka lamented, but in a more subdued and defeated tone, her hands letting go of the controls. She wondered if it was her mistake for the sync to fail.  
"为什么？" 明日香哀叹道，但语气更为低沉和挫败，双手离开了控制器。她想知道同步失败是否是她的错。

_Is this my fault? Have I done something wrong?  
这是我的错吗？我做错了什么吗？_

_No… I must calm down… I need to concentrate… Please, Mama, I know you're hearing me; this is my only chance left.  
不…我必须冷静下来…我需要集中注意力…妈妈，请您听到我；这是我最后的机会了。_

She then sighed deeply, before closing her eyes, trying to relax and think of the sunflower field. She was desperately racing through the undergrowth, parting away the stalks and leaves, finding her way out and into her mother's arms.  
她随后深叹一口气，闭上眼睛，试图放松并想象向日葵田。她拼命地在灌木丛中奔跑，拨开茎秆和叶子，寻找出路，投入母亲的怀抱。

But then Asuka sensed a warm feeling enveloping her, and she opened her eyes to find herself staring back at her mother, who was floating right in front, dressed in a diaphanous gown. Kyoko looked serene, smiling as she touched Asuka's forehead. At first the girl was speechless in shock, yet quickly everything made sense.  
但随后，明日香感觉到一种温暖的感觉包围着她，她睁开眼睛，发现自己正凝视着母亲，她漂浮在正前方，身着一件薄如蝉翼的长裙。绫波零看起来宁静而安详，微笑着轻触明日香的额头。起初，女孩震惊得说不出话来，但很快一切都变得清晰起来。

"Mama?" she gasped. "You were here?"  
“妈妈？”她喘息道，“你在这里？”

_Kyoko nodded in return. "I'm sorry if I neglected you for too long," she whispered. "It's my fault."  
绫波零点头回应。“对不起，如果我忽视你太久了，”她低声说，“这是我的错。”_

Asuka was blinking. "Why do you have to be here? Why it has to be your fault?"  
明日香眨了眨眼。“你为什么非得在这里？为什么这一切都得是你的错？”

"_This was supposed to be my life's work," Kyoko said. "But it consumed a part of me, just as it consumed the others, so I paid the price. The woman you saw then on the bed wasn't me, but you're now looking at my true self. Forgive me if I left you alone, for the pain and the suffering, and what you have become..."_  
“这本应是我毕生的工作，”绫子说。“但它吞噬了我的一部分，就像吞噬了其他人一样，所以我付出了代价。你当时在床上看到的那个女人不是我，但现在你看到的是真正的我。如果我让你独自承受痛苦和苦难，以及你所变成的样子，请原谅我……”

Asuka managed a hard lump in her throat. "N… No, I'm sorry for what I did… or said to you."  
明日香艰难地咽下喉咙里的硬块。“不……不，我为我对你的所作所为或所说的话感到抱歉。”

_The older apparition sighed instead. "It is settled and all's forgiven, Asuka. Rather, I want you to live on… No, we have to live on." Kyoko then smiled. "From today, I'll protect you this time… so I love you."  
年长的幽灵叹了口气。“事情已经解决，一切都已原谅，明日香。不如说，我希望你能活下去……不，我们必须活下去。”绫波零微笑道，“从今天起，这次换我来保护你……所以，我爱你。”_

This time Asuka was crying tears of gratitude.  
这次，明日香流下了感激的泪水。

"Thank you, Mama," she whispered, having found her at last in the middle of the field, holding her mother's hand this time.  
“谢谢你，妈妈，”她低声说道，终于在田野中央找到了母亲，这次她握住了母亲的手。

"_Let's go home, then," Kyoko answered, laughing lightly before everything around Asuka came alive and online._  
“那我们回家吧。”绫子笑着回答，随后周围的一切在明日香身边苏醒并启动。

---

Maya blinked again, as she saw a flicker of a bar on the sync meter. She peered closer and said, "Sir, I think we're getting an unusual reading this time."  
真希波再次眨眼，她看到同步率仪表上闪过一丝波动。她凑近了些，说道：“长官，这次我们似乎收到了一个异常的读数。”

"What?" Fuyutsuki asked before he glanced at the main display. The sync rate was showing 0.5% at first, then 1.2%, increasing steadily as it cleared 10%, before reaching 22%. They could even hear a growing hum coming from Unit-02, and most of everyone in the control room dropped their jaws.  
“什么？”冬月问道，随即看向主显示屏。同步率起初显示为 0.5%，接着上升到 1.2%，稳步增长，突破 10%后，最终达到 22%。他们甚至能听到二号机传来的逐渐增强的嗡鸣声，控制室里的绝大多数人都目瞪口呆。

"I'm having increases in most of the figures across the board," Shigeru reported. "We're seeing growing activity within the Eva. Synapses are being energized."  
"各项数据普遍上升，" 四郎报告道。"Eva 内部的活跃度正在增强。神经突触正在被激活。"

Fuyutsuki then turned to the rest of the control crew. "Are we recording this?"  
冬月随后转向控制室的其余人员。"我们在记录这一切吗？"

"Yes, everything on her, sir!" Makoto answered, the sensors reading off Unit-02 and recording the data in real time. "Look at that! She's beyond the minimum functional limit!" he called out, pointing at the displays, and then at Unit-02, whose four eyes were ablaze. "She's now getting on sync!"  
"是的，所有数据都在实时记录，长官！" 真琴回答，传感器正读取二号机的数据并实时记录。"看那！她已经超过了最低功能限制！" 他指着显示屏，然后指向二号机，其四只眼睛正闪耀着光芒。"她现在正在同步！"

In reaction, great cheers erupted in the control room as Asuka and Unit-02 overcame the 40% marker, watching her laugh and cry at the same time in the Entry Plug. The crew was shaking hands, clapping, doing high-fives and hugs, especially with Shinji and Misato, overcome with emotion as they embraced and danced around. Fuyutsuki merely sighed in pleasure, and Natsumi was trying not to cry too much.  
反应之下，控制室里爆发出巨大的欢呼声，因为明日香和二号机突破了 40%的标记，看着她在插入栓里又笑又哭。船员们互相握手、鼓掌、击掌拥抱，尤其是与真嗣和美里，他们激动地拥抱并四处跳舞。冬月只是满足地叹了口气，而夏津美则在努力不让自己哭得太多。

As for Rei and Kaworu, they could only look at each other and smile softly, their clasped hands holding tight as though victorious.  
至于绫波和渚薰，他们只能彼此相视，温柔地微笑，紧握的双手仿佛胜利般紧紧相握。

"She has understood at last," Rei whispered.  
“她终于明白了。”绫波轻声说道。

The Fifth Children exhaled in relief, and shrugged. "Well… Sometimes it just takes a bit of a nudge to make miracles happen."  
第五适格者松了口气，耸耸肩。“好吧……有时候，只需轻轻一推，奇迹就会发生。”

---

In the Entry Plug, Asuka breathed in relief, and then she settled down to business. Her eyes ran over status displays on the HUD, the figures are in the green, and nodded.  
在插入栓中，明日香松了口气，然后开始认真起来。她的目光扫过 HUD 上的状态显示，数字都是绿色的，她点了点头。

"Are you doing fine?" Fuyutsuki asked her through the comlink.  
“你还好吗？”冬月通过通讯器问她。

"Roger that, sir," Asuka replied, as she checked her current sync rate on the HUD: it was at 42.9%, a bit higher than Shinji's first time on Unit-01, and this rate was considered perfectly normal. She felt like as if today was now akin to having her birthday and all the holidays thrown into one.  
“收到，长官，”明日香回答道，同时检查着 HUD 上自己的同步率：达到了 42.9%，比真嗣第一次驾驶初号机时稍高，这个数值被认为是完全正常的。她感觉今天仿佛是自己的生日加上所有节日都汇聚到了一起。

The Sub-Commander cleared his throat. "You'll have to stick around for about thirty minutes for us to check if your sync rate stabilizes itself."  
副司令清了清嗓子。“你需要在这里停留大约三十分钟，以便我们检查你的同步率是否能自行稳定。”

Asuka nodded eagerly. "Okay, sir. I'll keep it that way."  
明日香急切地点头。“好的，长官。我会保持这样。”

"All harmonics values are normal. Everything is under control," Maya added, her video screen barging in. "I'd say… Congratulations!"  
“所有谐波值均正常。一切尽在掌握，”真希波补充道，她的视频画面突然切入。“我想说……恭喜！”

"Thanks!" Asuka answered.  
“谢谢！”明日香回答道。

"Now, young lady, I'll be frank this time: yours is quite a very slim chance, so I was wondering, how did you manage to bring Unit Two back?" Fuyutsuki asked, completely skeptical.  
“现在，小姑娘，我这次要直说了：你的机会相当渺茫，所以我想知道，你是怎么把二号机带回来的？”冬月问道，语气中满是怀疑。

The Second Children shrugged, not wanting to tell what transpired in the plug, but instead she said, "Can't say much, but… I found my Mama!"  
第二适格者耸了耸肩，不想透露插槽内发生的事情，只是说：“不能说太多，但是……我找到了我的妈妈！”

---

Back at the office, Gendo Ikari shook his head as he watched the whole video feed on the monitor: they loaded Asuka in the plug and powered up Unit-02, and then a zero sync-rate before the unexpected reactivation which finally brought the whole control room in a paroxysm of cheerful pandemonium.  
回到办公室，碇源堂摇了摇头，看着监视器上的整个视频：他们将明日香装入插槽并启动了二号机，然后是零同步率，紧接着是意料之外的重启，最终整个控制室陷入了一片欢腾的混乱。

How that happened? Impossible.  
怎么会这样？不可能。

Was it luck? No… Perhaps.  
是运气吗？不……或许是。

Behind his glasses, Gendo's eyes narrowed, figuring out an explanation for all this, and… He remembered unusual anomalies like that, all exclusively done by Unit-01, of cases of independent activation and that single 400% sync phenomenon in which the Eva nearly claimed and absorbed Shinji. If such things happened before with Unit-01, then it's not impossible for Unit-02 to make a surprising turnaround like this one happening now.  
透过眼镜，碇源堂的眼睛眯了起来，他在脑海中寻找着这一切的解释，然后……他想起了那些不寻常的异常现象，所有这些都仅由零号机所为，包括独立激活的案例和那次单一的 400%同步现象，在那次事件中，Eva 几乎要夺取并吸收真嗣。如果零号机之前就发生过这样的事情，那么二号机出现现在这样的惊人逆转也就并非不可能了。

The bearded Commander picked up the phone and dialed for Fuyutsuki down at the control room. Once connected, at first he could hear excited chatter coming from the technicians in the background.  
留着胡须的指挥官拿起电话，拨通了位于控制室的冬月。一旦接通，他首先能听到技术人员们兴奋的交谈声从背景中传来。

"Yes?" Fuyutsuki answered. "It's done. It's also a success."  
"什么事？" 冬月回答。"完成了。而且成功了。"

"I know," Gendo said, before he recalled the old man's earlier assertion. "You win this time again," he added.  
"我知道，" 碇源堂说，随后他想起了老人之前的断言。"你这次又赢了，" 他补充道。"

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat. "I'm not a gambler but a scientist, yet anyone gambles for a winning chance even without holding the cards or rolling the dice, and this is a case of luck. Miss Langley beat the odds, and now we have what you wish for."  
冬月清了清嗓子。"我不是赌徒，而是科学家，但即便不握牌或掷骰，任何人都会为获胜的机会而赌一把，这纯粹是运气。兰利小姐战胜了概率，现在我们得到了你想要的东西。"

Gendo said nothing for a moment, before breaking the silence. "In their impatience, those old men tried to badger us to speed things up, but we took matters in our own hands," he said, referring to SEELE. "Then they attempted to stop us, cripple what we have, and now it would be interesting to see what their reactions would be like once they know that Unit-02 is back."  
源堂沉默片刻，随后打破了寂静。“那些老人们急于求成，试图催促我们加快进度，但我们决定自己掌控局面，”他指的是 SEELE。“然后他们试图阻止我们，削弱我们的力量，现在一旦他们得知 02 号机回归，真想知道他们会作何反应。”

For a while he watched Kaworu and Rei onscreen as they held hands together, before he concluded, "We'll keep Miss Langley, and tell her that effective immediately she will resume her duties."  
他注视着屏幕上薰和绫波手牵手的一幕，过了一会儿说道：“我们将继续保留兰格利小姐，并告知她立即恢复她的职责。”

"Yes, I'll inform her," Fuyutsuki said. "I'll also take care of things here while we're putting her through a stability test," he added. "See you later."  
“好的，我会通知她，”冬月说。“我也会在这里处理事务，同时对她进行稳定性测试，”他补充道。“回头见。”

The Sub-Commander disconnected before Gendo put down the receiver, resumed his favorite thinking position and murmured, this time in a pleased tone. Now that this episode with Asuka was done with, he would tackle the matter of the Fifth Children, and so he grabbed the phone and dialed for Director Hamamoto.  
副指挥官在碇源堂放下听筒前就已断开连接，恢复了他最喜欢的思考姿势，这次用一种满意的语气低声说道。既然与明日香的事件已经解决，他将着手处理第五适格者的事宜，于是他拿起电话，拨给了 Hamamoto 导演。

"What can I do for you?" the director asked.  
“有什么我能帮忙的吗？”导演问道。

Gendo said, "I insist that you people must start placing closer surveillance on the Fifth Children, and I want to find out exactly about his activities."  
碇源堂说：“我坚持要求你们加强对第五适格者的监控，我要确切了解他的所有活动。”

"We'll do whatever we can," Hamamoto complied. "As for our investigation, thanks to Doctor Akagi, we're closing in with some suspicious email addresses and phone numbers, so we put a trace on them."  
"我们会尽我们所能，" 滨本同意道。"至于我们的调查，多亏了赤城医生，我们锁定了一些可疑的电子邮件地址和电话号码，所以已经在追踪它们了。"

"Go on."

"It appears that much of the conversation traffic between Oda and his handlers originated somewhere in Europe. That's all what we have so far, sir."  
"看来大部分奥田和他的操纵者之间的通讯流量都源自欧洲的某个地方。这是我们目前掌握的所有信息，长官。"

"I see, but I want this done as soon as possible."  
"我明白了，但我希望这件事能尽快完成。"

"Will do, sir," he said before disconnecting.  
“遵命，先生。”他说完便挂断了电话。

Once Gendo set the phone aside, he said, "Some may attempt to alter every variable and all; some try to interfere outright, and some even resort to violent options, but still… Everything is going according to the scenario."  
源堂放下电话后，说道：“有些人试图改变每一个变量；有些人则直接干预，甚至采取暴力手段，但即便如此……一切仍在按照剧本进行。”

**Author's Notes:** This chapter is partly full of R's: first, three drafts and several nights of _reassembling_ and _rearranging_ most of the paragraphs, and then _remixing_ all of them right here; ideas that were otherwise previously discarded were _rehashed_ and _rewritten_ before I pasted them in some sections; and old snippets of original story ideas in RTF documents were kept in reserve until I _retrieved_ and _reedited_ them into the chapters.  
作者笔记：这篇chapter充满了 R 的元素：首先，经历了三次草稿和数夜的重组与重排大部分段落，然后在此基础上进行混音；之前被丢弃的想法经过重新加工和改写后，被粘贴到某些部分；而 RTF 文档中旧的原创故事片段则被保留备用，直到我重新找回并编辑进章节中。

Well… Now that Asuka has finally got her groove back on Unit-02, I'm guessing that some people are guessing what would come in the next chapter. Can't say but soon I'm going to throw in whatever's left of Episode 24 and expand much of its important parts, just as I did with Season One.  
嗯…既然明日香终于找回了她在二号机上的状态，我猜有些人会好奇接下来在《chapter》中会发生什么。虽然不能透露太多，但我很快就会加入《第 24 话》的剩余部分，并扩展其中许多重要情节，就像我对第一季所做的那样。

On the other hand, in one previous chapter a reader claimed that our favorite pairing has just … you know. But that wasn't what I really meant, so I changed that by adding "still fully clothed". Sorry, it's not yet their time to dance on the bed. Not yet.  
另一方面，在之前的《chapter》中，有读者声称我们最喜欢的组合刚刚…你知道的。但这并不是我的本意，所以我通过加上“仍然衣着整齐”来修改了这一点。抱歉，他们还没到床上共舞的时候。还没呢。

And again, just say NO to "Swifties" (laughs).  
再次强调，对“斯威夫蒂”说“不”（笑）。

Still, many thanks and good morning to those who picked this fic up and gave their comments (and criticisms) or added me and LW to their Author/Story Update Alerts. I'll hold on and write more.  
尽管如此，仍要感谢那些挑选这篇小说并给予评论（及批评）或添加我和 LW 到作者/故事更新提醒的人。我会坚持下去，继续写作。

### Chapter 25 Negotiation, Part 1  
Chapter 25 谈判，第一部分

Despite being awash with the euphoria of Asuka's comeback, borne from the successful reactivation of Unit-02, the other thing that occupied Misato's mind throughout the whole time was on how she could deal with Kaworu, who stood alongside Rei just a few meters away from her.  
尽管沉浸在明日香归来的喜悦中，这份喜悦源自于二号机成功重启，但整个过程中占据美里心头的另一件事是如何应对站在丽身边仅几米之遥的渚薰。

Meanwhile, Shinji was watching Asuka via video feed on the main display, the boy munching on Pocky sticks from the red box, as the girl in the cockpit was preoccupied with the piped-in pop music to kill boredom. For now, the control room staff was busy supervising the girl and the Eva, as they put them through a stability test to ensure that her new sync rate was no flash in the pan. So far, they were five minutes into the stability test proper, with Asuka's sync rate leveled out at 42% with no noticeable problems.  
与此同时，真嗣正通过主显示屏的视频直播观察着明日香，男孩一边啃着红色盒子里的百奇饼干，一边看着驾驶舱里的女孩沉浸在通过扬声器播放的流行音乐中以打发无聊。眼下，指挥室的工作人员正忙于监督明日香和 EVA，对他们进行稳定性测试，以确保她的新同步率并非昙花一现。到目前为止，他们已经进行了五分钟的正式稳定性测试，明日香的同步率稳定在 42%，没有出现明显问题。

Fuyutsuki was preoccupied, talking to the crew, discussing their analyses and findings, while Natsumi was with Maya, deep in conversation while keeping tabs on Asuka's vital signs.  
冬月正忙于与团队交谈，讨论他们的分析和发现，而夏美则与摩耶深入交谈，同时密切关注明日香的生命体征。

Knowing that Kaworu was no doubt an Angel, Misato wondered what was on his mind, what plans he must've conceived, and what that boy was really up to.  
深知碇真嗣无疑是一名使徒，美里不禁好奇他心中所想，他必定策划了什么计划，以及那个男孩究竟在打什么主意。

Should anyone tries to kill Kaworu, a gun will be out of the question, as he was clearly the Committee's perfect 'smart' weapon, and Angels _always_ have an AT-Field, and of course _only_ an Eva can cancel out and bring down that Field with their own before killing their opponents.  
如果有人试图杀死渚薰，使用枪械是绝对不可能的，因为他显然是委员会制造的完美‘智能’武器，而使徒总是拥有 AT 力场，当然只有 EVA 才能在杀死对手之前用自己的力量抵消并打破那个力场。

However, 'smart' as Kaworu may seem to be, humans are flawed, and with Misato figuring that he was made almost in the same way that Rei was created, he could also possess such flaws.  
然而，尽管渚薰看似‘聪明’，人类是有缺陷的，而美里认为他是以与绫波零相似的方式被创造出来的，他也可能拥有这样的缺陷。

Like having human emotions.  
比如拥有人类的情感。

Ever since the first time they met Misato took note of his speech pattern; Kaworu sounded lively, confident, frank, open, and very intelligent for a fifteen-year-old teenager. Yet amazingly he fell for Rei, a girl who's his polar opposite in terms of emotions, so he must've opened up his true feelings.  
自从他们第一次见面起，美里就注意到了他的说话方式；渚薰听起来充满活力，自信，直率，开放，对于一个十五岁的少年来说非常聪明。然而令人惊讶的是，他爱上了绫波，一个在情感上与他截然相反的女孩，所以他一定是敞开了他的真实情感。

Misato also tried to figure out as to how they managed to hit it off, and what actually transpired on that afternoon, when those two Children were alone with each other.  
美里也试图弄清楚他们是如何一拍即合的，以及那天下午，当这两个孩子单独相处时究竟发生了什么。

The woman officer shook her head, and then she went back to her plot, thinking what should be the best approach to negotiation. _I want to confront him, but how can I tell Kaworu the truth?_  
女军官摇了摇头，然后她回到自己的计划中，思考着谈判的最佳策略。我想面对他，但我该如何向渚薰坦白真相呢？

---

On the other hand, Kaworu was sure that Misato was watching him, figuring out that she must be waiting, probably wishing to talk, and somehow she might have unraveled the truth behind his identity.  
另一方面，渚薰确信美里在观察他，猜想她一定在等待，或许希望交谈，并且不知怎的她可能已经揭开了他身份背后的真相。

"Rei," Kaworu whispered.

"Yes?"

"I need to talk to Misato," he said, holding her hand. "I can feel it, so just wait for me, okay? Might take a while."  
“我需要和美里谈谈，”他说着，握住她的手。“我能感觉到，所以请等我一下，好吗？可能需要一段时间。”

Rei nodded before Kaworu walked over to Misato, who was surprised to see him come to her. Before she could speak, the Fifth Children answered, "I know you're waiting for me."  
绫波零点点头，看着渚薰走向美里，她见到他过来感到惊讶。在她开口之前，第五适格者回答道：“我知道你在等我。”

"How did you know?" Misato asked, having a bit of a double-take. She couldn't believe that Kaworu was that much perceptive.  
“你怎么知道的？”美里有些惊讶地问道。她不敢相信渚薰竟然如此敏锐。

Kaworu shook his head. "I can't tell you here, so instead why don't we find a quiet place to talk?"  
渚薰摇了摇头。“这里不方便说，不如我们找个安静的地方谈谈？”

Misato nodded. "Sure," she agreed. "I know there's a good spot somewhere."  
美里点点头。“当然，”她同意道。“我知道有个不错的地方。”

As they were about to walk out of the control room, Shinji noticed this and he asked, "Wait, where you're going?"  
正当他们准备走出控制室时，真嗣注意到了这一点，他问道：“等等，你们要去哪儿？”

Misato replied, "Something very important. It's just between me and him, so don't worry, we'll be back."  
美里回答说：“有件非常重要的事。只是我和他之间的事，别担心，我们很快就会回来。”

"Okay," Shinji said and he watched her and Kaworu go out of the door.  
“好吧，”真嗣说，他看着她和渚薰走出门去。

Misato and Kaworu went out of the control room, turned right and walked down the hallway. They stopped at a room, whose door was labeled "Equipment Maintenance and Repair Room". The woman nodded to Kaworu and she opened the door, and they walked in.  
美里和渚薰走出控制室，向右转，沿着走廊走去。他们在标有“设备维护与修理室”的门前停下。美里向渚薰点头示意，随后打开门，两人一同进入。

The room contained several lockers; on their far right, a work table and several toolboxes on top, and to the left shelves held banks of electronic equipment. Once Misato closed and locked the door, she said, "All right, I'm going to be very diplomatic, and this time we're talking very serious here, and very personal, so I want you to explain everything first."  
房间内设有几个储物柜；最右边是一张工作台和几个工具箱，左边则是摆放着电子设备的架子。美里关上门并上锁后，说道：“好了，这次我会非常圆滑，我们谈的是非常严肃且私人的事情，所以我要你先解释清楚一切。”

For a few moments Kaworu didn't waver before her gaze, as she waited for him to speak.  
有那么一会儿，渚薰在她目光下并未动摇，她等待着他开口。

"I believe that you've already know who I am," he finally said, breaking the silence.  
“我相信你已经知道我是谁了，”他终于打破沉默说道。

"An _Angel_," Misato answered.  
“一个使徒，”美里回答道。

"Yes, you're right," Kaworu said, nodding. "I was sent here and supposed to act as a replacement for Asuka. That was my cover, and will you tell me how did you obtain this knowledge?"  
"是的，你说得对，" 渚薰点头说道，"我是被派来这里，作为明日香的替代品。那是我的掩护身份，你能告诉我你是如何得知这些信息的吗？"

Misato sighed, and she began to enumerate her findings. "First, someone said that your sync rate during the first test showed just how easy for you to manipulate it, like you can raise or lower it at your whim. They managed to record all that, and I saw the results of that test. Second, your DNA sequence is an anomaly, as you share certain characteristics with other Angels. Finally, the Committee gave us nothing except a birth date. All that makes you a red flag."  
美里叹了口气，开始列举她的发现。"首先，有人说你在第一次测试中的同步率显示了你操纵它的容易程度，就像你可以随心所欲地提高或降低它。他们设法记录了这一切，我看到了测试结果。其次，你的 DNA 序列异常，因为你与其他使徒有某些共同特征。最后，委员会除了一个出生日期外什么也没给我们。所有这些都让你成为一个危险信号。"

"They're all true," Kaworu said. "Actually, I have _no_ intent to do any harm."  
"这些都是真的，" 渚薰说，"实际上，我无意造成任何伤害。"

"Why?"

"I changed my mind, after reconsidering my plan to contact Adam. I'm _not_ going to do that. It's out of the question now."  
"在重新考虑联系亚当的计划后，我改变了主意。我不会那么做了。现在这已经不可能了。"

The woman had a double-take, blinking her eyes. "That's what Angels are _supposed_ to do, attack and try to contact Adam. Why can't you?"  
女人愣了一下，眨了眨眼睛。“天使本该攻击并试图联系亚当。你为什么不能？”

"Humanity still has a chance to redeem itself, and I understood why, through the pain and suffering of others, of joy and happiness. Humans don't need to be punished any further, as the Second Impact is disastrous enough that people should be remorseful, think about their own actions and the future of their existence. Furthermore, any civilization with high culture, rather than its wealth, territory, and weaponry, has a reason to be respected and preserved. A song is an example of high culture; to me it means that humans are capable of fostering peaceful coexistence and of enlightenment."  
"人类仍有自我救赎的机会，我通过他人的痛苦与苦难、喜悦与幸福明白了这一点。人类不需要再受惩罚，第二次冲击已经足够灾难性，人们应该感到悔恨，反思自己的行为和未来的存在。此外，任何拥有高度文化的文明，而非其财富、领土和武器，都有理由受到尊重和保护。一首歌就是高度文化的例子；对我来说，这意味着人类有能力促进和平共处和启蒙。"

"So because of that, you don't want to cause Third Impact?"  
"所以因为这样，你不想引发第三次冲击？"

"I really don't want to, all for the sake of people like you, Shinji and Asuka… and because I love Rei."  
"我真的不想，全是为了像你、真嗣和明日香这样的人……还因为我爱丽。"

Misato shook her head  
美里摇了摇头

Kaworu said, "I have something else to tell. Like how and where I actually came from."  
渚薰说：“我还有别的事要告诉你。比如我究竟是从哪里来的。”

"How?"

The young man sighed. "I was cloned from what was left of Adam, and combined with genetic material from a Lilim, and in the same purpose as with Rei, I was made as the vessel for Adam's soul."  
年轻人叹了口气。“我是用亚当残留的部分克隆出来的，并结合了莉莉姆的基因，和绫波一样，我是作为亚当灵魂的容器而被创造出来的。”

"And who created you?"  
“那又是谁创造了你？”

In a flashback, Kaworu remembered the old man he watched while floating in his containment tank, talking to Chairman Lorenz.  
在一段闪回中，渚薰记得他在拘禁舱中漂浮时观察到的那个老人，他与洛伦兹主席交谈着。

"Doctor Steingarten… Naoko Akagi's colleague in the field of bioengineering. I know that because back then I heard him talking to the Chairman several times before; they created me in the same way they created Rei, yet I was raised differently."  
“斯坦加滕博士……生物工程领域的同事，与赤城直子。我知道这些，因为在那之前我多次听到他与主席交谈；他们以创造绫波的方式创造了我和绫波，但我被抚养的方式不同。”

Misato blinked, realizing that she was going deep into uncharted territory, and possibly an opportunity to gain answers to Kaji's riddles, hearing promising first-hand information from what was clearly a very reliable source. "Who's the Chairman?"  
美里眨了眨眼，意识到自己正深入未知的领域，或许有机会解开加持的谜团，从显然非常可靠的来源直接听到有希望的信息。“谁是主席？”

"I believe that you've came across him before," Kaworu said. "He's Chairman Lorenz."  
"我相信你之前见过他，"渚薰说道，"他是洛伦兹主席。"

The woman had a quick recall of that day at the holographic communications room: she confronted five men seated around a long table, old men in robe-like suits; and at the head of the table was the leader of them all, a visor across his eyes, silvery hair, and an age-induced bulk. She could even remember the voice of that man as he spoke to her.  
女人迅速回忆起那天在全息通讯室的那一刻：她面对着围坐在长桌旁的五个人，那些穿着长袍般西装的老者；而坐在桌首的，是他们的领袖，戴着眼罩，银发苍苍，因岁月而显得臃肿。她甚至记得那个男人对她说话时的声音。

"I remember him. He's the member of the Human Instrumentality Committee," Misato answered. "Does it mean that… you're supposed to work for him?"  
"我记得他。他是人类补完委员会的成员，"美里回答道，"这是否意味着……你得为他工作？"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes."

The woman's eyes narrowed. "Now… Tell me, are you involved with the incidents in the last 24 hours? Those men trying to kill us? Are you working alongside them?"  
女人的眼睛眯了起来。“现在……告诉我，你与过去 24 小时内的事件有关吗？那些试图杀死我们的人？你和他们是一伙的吗？”

The Fifth Children frowned. "No, I'm not connected to them. I was supposed to work independently. In fact, I never even know all about them."  
第五号孩子们皱起眉头。“不，我和他们没有关联。我本应独立行动。事实上，我甚至对他们一无所知。”

Misato looked cross. "Why not? It's a coincidence that you came here, and then all the sudden bullets are flying everywhere! Who are they, anyway?"  
美里看起来很生气。“为什么？你来到这里，然后突然间子弹四处飞射！他们到底是谁？”

Kaworu sighed. "They must be working on behalf of the Committee."  
渚薰叹了口气。“他们一定是受委员会的指使。”

"What? You mean they wanted Asuka dead?"  
“什么？你是说他们想让明日香死？”

"Apparently they desired conditions to make it easier to implement their agenda, and so I think they gave someone the orders to remove her as soon as possible."  
“显然他们希望创造条件，以便更容易推行他们的议程，所以我认为他们下达了尽快除掉她的命令。”

"So it makes sense…" Misato trailed off, her mind making associations between seemingly unrelated incidents.  
"这么说来，这就有道理了……" 美里话音渐弱，脑海中将看似无关的事件联系起来。

"Now because of their impatience, using other men to implement violent action, I don't want to be associated with them and their agenda any longer. Their treacherous actions gave me impetus to rethink my supposed goals, and so I decided to turn my back from their scheme."  
"现在，由于他们的急躁，利用他人实施暴力行为，我不想再与他们及其议程有任何瓜葛。他们的背叛行为促使我重新审视自己所谓的目标，因此我决定从他们的阴谋中抽身。"

"Wait," Misato said. "Are you changing sides?"  
"等等，" 美里说。"你要变节吗？"

"Yes. I'm on _your_ side now."  
"是的，我现在站在你这边。"

"But you're an Angel. How could I trust you?"  
"但你是个天使，我怎么能相信你？"

"Because you're one of the few people left who are worthy enough for me, to listen and, if necessary, take action. I also believe you can still keep a secret." Kaworu heaved a sigh. "Do you have anything else for me to answer?"  
"因为你是我为数不多认为值得倾听并必要时采取行动的人之一。我也相信你仍能保守秘密。" 渚薰叹了口气。"你还有什么要我回答的吗？"

"Apart from him using thugs for the dirty work, what does the Chairman _actually_ wants you to do?" she asked.  
"除了他利用打手来做肮脏的工作，董事长实际上想让你做什么？" 她问道。

"Well… Besides replacing Asuka and attempting to contact Adam," Kaworu said. "On orders I'm also supposed to befriend Shinji… and then later break his will by betraying him, to foster doubt, hatred and pain in him… In short, try to drive him to destruction."  
"嗯……除了替换明日香和尝试联系亚当，" 渚薰说。"按照命令，我还应该与真嗣交朋友……然后通过背叛他来摧毁他的意志，在他心中培养怀疑、仇恨和痛苦……简而言之，试图将他推向毁灭。"

It was past ten minutes into the stability test, and still there was no sign of anything significant. Deciding that talking to Asuka would make things interesting, Shinji walked over to Maya, who was manning her workstation, and asked, "Can I talk to Asuka in private?"  
稳定性测试已经进行了十多分钟，仍然没有任何显著迹象。决定和明日香聊聊会让事情变得有趣，真嗣走到正在操作工作站的玛雅身边，问道："我可以和明日香私下谈谈吗？"

Maya nodded. "Sure, no problem," she said, handing to him her headset before getting off the seat. "Just press the blue key to go into private mode, and the red key to talk."  
玛雅点点头。“当然，没问题，”她说着将耳机递给他，然后起身离开座位。“只需按蓝色键进入私密模式，红色键开始通话。”

"Okay, thank you," Shinji said, smiling while sitting down as Maya walked away towards Natsumi, who was watching over Asuka's vital signs. The young man then took a breath, looked up to the camera above the monitor, and pressed the keys. By using private mode, the workstation can talk to the Entry Plug exclusively, and shutting out all other eavesdroppers.  
“好的，谢谢，”真嗣微笑着坐下，看着玛雅走向夏美，夏美正监控着明日香的生命体征。年轻人深吸一口气，抬头看向监视器上方的摄像头，按下了按键。通过使用私密模式，工作站可以与插入栓单独通话，屏蔽所有其他窃听者。

"What's up?" Asuka said, looking back at him through the monitor via video feed.  
“怎么了？”明日香通过视频监控回头看着他。

"Thought I like to talk… Just anything," Shinji said. "Got an idea?"  
"我以为我喜欢说话…随便什么话题都行，" 真嗣说道。"有什么主意吗？"

"Sometimes, I realize you were no different… No, you were almost like Kaji," she remarked.  
"有时候，我意识到你和他没什么不同…不，你几乎就像加持先生，" 她评论道。"

"Why?"

"'Cause I felt that back then, when he's together with Misato, he was everything in a man. He, I admit, kinda the right man for her. Nothing else."  
"'因为我当时就有那种感觉，当他与美里在一起时，他是一个男人该有的一切。我承认，他有点像是她的真命天子。别的就没什么了。"

Asuka chuckled, a quick thought popped into her brain. "I remember about that lavender perfume I used, the one Misato had worn. He came home with her, and he smelled of that perfume."  
明日香轻声笑了起来，一个念头突然闪过她的脑海。“我记得那款薰衣草香水，就是美里用过的那款。他那天和她一起回家，身上就带着那种香味。”

"Oh, I remember," Shinji answered. "The night we tried to kiss."  
“哦，我记得，”真嗣回答道，“就是我们试图接吻的那个晚上。”

"Yeah. I was then fooling you, saying we needed to kill time."  
“是啊。我当时还骗你说我们需要打发时间。”

Shinji smirked. "Funny, I felt embarrassed throughout that minute."  
真嗣微微一笑。“真有意思，那一分钟里我可是尴尬得要命。”

"Well, I thought I was doing it right. Must be me minding too much to expect from you."  
“好吧，我还以为自己做得挺对呢。看来是我太在意，对你期望过高了。”

The young man sighed. "It's been strange that you shouted at me as if you kicked me in the ass."  
年轻人叹了口气。“你这么冲我嚷嚷，感觉就像踢了我一脚似的，真是奇怪。”

Asuka blinked. "What?" 明日香眨了眨眼。“什么？”

"Back at the car, I mean. I… I was then scared like hell, and I wasn't sure what to do."  
“我是说回到车上的时候。我……我当时吓坏了，不知道该怎么办。”

"You panicked, that's why," Asuka added.  
"“你慌了，所以才会这样，”明日香补充道。”

"I've been used to being frightened for too long," he admitted. "But I remembered about you almost having your head cut off back when the Angel came down and nearly erased Headquarters off the face of the earth. That really scared me, of you and Ayanami being hurt."  
"我已经习惯了长时间处于恐惧之中，"他坦白道。"但我记得天使降临，差点把总部从地球上抹去时，你差点被砍掉头的那一幕。那真的吓到我了，担心你和绫波会受伤。"

Shinji sighed. "It's thankful that you did put sense in me, because sometimes I seem to forget what Kaworu told me, saying that I have to live with the pain."  
真嗣叹了口气。"幸好你让我清醒了，因为我有时似乎忘记了渚薰告诉我的话，说我必须与痛苦共存。"

Asuka pursed her lips for a second and said, "I have a feeling that our comfort days are coming to an end. That's what I'm afraid of, but… As I wanted to be back, this time I don't mind a bit of pain. Pain to counter some of the comfort, to have some sort of a balance, an equilibrium, you know from science classes, about the laws of physics."  
明日香抿了抿嘴唇，说道："我感觉我们的安逸日子快要结束了。我害怕的就是这个，但是……既然我想要回来，这次我并不介意一点痛苦。用痛苦来抵消一些安逸，达到某种平衡，就像科学课上学到的物理定律那样。"

Shinji nodded. "Uh, huh."

"Okay, let's just say that you won a ticket to stay in Tahiti for a year," Asuka spoke, warming up to the intellectual equivalent of the deep end of the pool.  
“好吧，假设你赢得了一张在塔希提岛居住一年的票，”明日香说道，这相当于进入了智力的深水区。

"Yeah," Shinji answered, visualizing himself as a stick-figure drawing waving a ticket, jumping for joy.  
“嗯，”真嗣回答，想象自己像一个挥舞着票的火柴人，欢呼雀跃。

"Everything's provided for, all expenses paid and tax-free. No work or even house chores required; all you need is to relax and enjoy yourself, yet the catch is that you're not allowed to leave," Asuka said.  
“一切都被安排好了，所有费用全包且免税。不需要工作，甚至不用做家务；你只需要放松和享受，但条件是你不能离开，”明日香说。

"I see. Sounds good."  
"我明白了。听起来不错。"

"The first day on the beach, you feel really lucky, lapping the sun, drinks by your side, servants at your beck and call, and parties at night. That day stretches to a week, same thing each day, then a month, until you reach at the end of your stay. By that time, how do you feel then?"  
"在海滩上的第一天，你感到非常幸运，沐浴着阳光，身边有饮料，仆人随叫随到，晚上还有派对。那一天延长到一周，每天都是同样的事情，然后是一个月，直到你度假结束。到那时，你感觉如何呢？"

"Bored. I can't do something what I really liked," Shinji answered, his stick-figure yawning out of boredom, sitting on the beach. "There's no choice, and I can't make my choices, right?"  
"无聊。我不能做我真正喜欢的事情，" 真嗣回答道，他的火柴人因无聊而打哈欠，坐在沙滩上。"没有选择，我无法做出自己的选择，对吧？"

"Absolutely. It's the same thing if you get caged in a prison, you know, the variety where you're with hardened murderers, swindlers and rapists; you're literally in hell for a year. That's pain, and there you don't have any choices either."  
"绝对如此。如果你被关进监狱，你知道的，就是那种和冷酷的杀人犯、骗子以及强奸犯关在一起的地方；你实际上在地狱里待了一年。那是痛苦，而且在那里你也没有任何选择。"

This time the stick-figure was behind bars, screaming and crying. Cringing at that vision, Shinji mentally used an imaginary eraser to take away the bars, and the stick-figure felt relieved, having understood why.  
这次，火柴人被关在栏杆后面，尖叫着哭泣。真嗣对这景象感到畏缩，他心中用一个想象中的橡皮擦抹去了栏杆，火柴人感到释然，明白了其中的原因。

"So, what you're saying is that too much pain or pleasure isn't good, huh?" Shinji asked.  
"所以，你的意思是过多的痛苦或快乐都不好，对吧？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah. There's always this duality going on in this universe," Asuka answered. "One to counter the other. Equilibrium to stabilize everything, yet without this universal duality we'll never exist. Good and evil; dark and light; heaven and hell; angels and demons; and heat and cold, and so on. Come to think of it, one can't live without the other."  
“是啊。这个宇宙总是存在着这种二元性，”明日香回答道，“一方与另一方相对立。平衡是为了稳定一切，但如果没有这种宇宙的二元性，我们也不会存在。善与恶；黑暗与光明；天堂与地狱；天使与恶魔；以及热与冷，等等。仔细想想，一方没有另一方是无法生存的。”

Shinji blinked. "Uh, wait a second, where did you learn all that, because they sound a bit deep?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“呃，等一下，这些你是从哪儿学来的，听起来有点深奥？”

Asuka sighed. "Some symposium back in college, and I was invited there, thinking it would be useful to add yet another factoid in my head. It's only now that even though I forgot his name, I was able remember what the lecturer said about duality back there. Anyway, we're really meant for each other, one to counter the other. Girl and boy. You and me. Equilibrium." The girl chuckled softly.  
明日香叹了口气。“大学时参加的一个研讨会，我以为能学到些有用的知识，增加点脑内的信息量。现在虽然忘了那个讲师的名字，但我还记得他关于二元性的那番话。总之，我们注定是要相互平衡的，一男一女。你和我。平衡。”女孩轻声笑了起来。

"Thanks for clearing things up for me," Shinji said. "Sometimes I feel a bit dumb."  
"谢谢你帮我理清了思路，" 真嗣说道。"有时候我觉得自己有点笨。"

"By the way," Asuka said. "What's up with the Wondergirl, 'cause a few minutes ago I saw her hold hands with Kaworu," she mentioned, pointing out at Rei, who was seated, silently reading a copy of _National Geographic_ magazine while waiting for Kaworu_._  
"对了，" 明日香说道。"那个三无少女是怎么回事，几分钟前我看到她和渚薰牵手了，" 她指着坐在那里静静阅读《国家地理》杂志等待渚薰的绫波说道。"

"Oh," Shinji blurted, before he leaned close to the camera. "They're in love now," he whispered.  
"哦，" 真嗣脱口而出，然后他靠近摄像头。"他们现在在恋爱了，" 他低声说道。"

Surprised, Asuka almost leapt off her seat. "_What?_" she exclaimed.  
阿斯卡惊讶得差点从座位上跳起来。“什么？”她惊呼道。

Halfway reading an article on whales, Rei suddenly sneezed, nearly causing her to drop the magazine. Acting on instinct, Rei sniffed twice and touched her nose, before she whispered, "They must be talking about me."  
丽正读着一篇关于鲸鱼的文章，突然打了个喷嚏，差点把杂志掉在地上。出于本能，丽吸了吸鼻子，摸了摸鼻子，然后低声说：“他们一定在谈论我。”

Resuming her reading, Rei concentrated at one of the underwater photos on the page; they looked like the ones she swam with in her dream. She read off the caption: sperm whales.  
丽继续阅读，专注地看着页面上的一张水下照片；它们看起来就像她在梦中一起游泳的那些。她读出标题：抹香鲸。

_What the whales I dreamed of does it mean to me? I do not know the answer yet.  
那些我梦中的鲸鱼对我意味着什么？我至今仍未找到答案。_

Instead she glanced up at Unit-02 right outside the control room, those four eyes of the crimson behemoth staring back, and then she wandered her gaze at Shinji, probably talking to Asuka.  
相反，她抬头望向控制室外面的二号机，那四只猩红的巨眼回望着她，随后她的目光游移到真嗣身上，他大概正在和明日香交谈。

And the boy was up on his feet, and was walking towards her. Shinji then asked, "Would you like to talk to Asuka?"  
男孩站起身，向她走来。真嗣接着问道：“你想和明日香谈谈吗？”

Rei set the magazine, setting it on top of the console and said, "Yes."  
丽将杂志放下，搁在控制台上，然后说：“是的。”

Shinji smiled. "Come on," he said.  
真嗣微笑着。“来吧，”他说。

The girl rose from her seat and they walked back to the workstation. With Shinji guiding her on how to use the communications gear, Rei sat down, wore the headset, pressed a few keys and glanced at Asuka on the monitor. The Second Children was in smiles, looking back at her.  
女孩从座位上站起来，他们一起走回工作站。在真嗣的指导下，丽坐下，戴上耳机，按了几个键，然后瞥了一眼显示器上的明日香。第二适格者正微笑着，回望着她。

"I should congratulate you," Asuka said, speaking through the headset. "For thawing out," she added in jest.  
"我应该恭喜你，" 明日香通过耳机说道。"因为你解冻了，" 她打趣地补充道。

"What do you mean?" Rei asked, while Shinji sat on a vacant chair and watched the opening conversation between the girls.  
"你什么意思？" 绫波问道，而真嗣坐在一张空椅子上，观察着女孩们之间的开场对话。

"I'm gonna like you this time. You're so open now, not unlike the last time, and thawing out means you're opening up… Okay, Shinji said you fell in love with Kaworu. Is that true?"  
"这次我会喜欢你的。你现在这么开放，不像上次那样，解冻意味着你在敞开心扉……好吧，真嗣说你爱上了渚薰。这是真的吗？"

Rei nodded. "Yes. I have understood his intentions for me. He explained everything before we kissed."  
丽点了点头。“是的。我已经明白他的心意了。在我们接吻之前，他解释了一切。”

Asuka cooed in admiration. "Awwwww… FIRST LOVE!" she exclaimed. "Just what he said to you?"  
明日香赞叹地发出轻柔的声音。“哇……初恋啊！”她惊呼道。“他就是这么跟你说的？”

Blushing, the First Children picked her words carefully before she spoke. "He said that I was like a rose, delicate and beautiful. I… I never heard someone say words like that to me before."  
脸颊泛红，第一少女斟酌着字句才开口。“他说我像一朵玫瑰，既娇嫩又美丽。我……我以前从未听过有人对我说这样的话。”

"You're a lucky girl, Wonder—I mean, Rei," Asuka answered, now using the other girl's first name to get more personal and respectful. "Your new boyfriend, I daresay, may sound old-fashioned, but I think only a handful of men are just like him. Kaworu's a rarity, you know, as if he belonged to another place and time."  
"你真是个幸运的女孩，Wonder——我是说，丽，" 明日香回答道，现在用对方的名字来显得更亲切和尊重。"你的新男友，我敢说，虽然听起来有点老派，但我觉得像他这样的男人屈指可数。薰是个稀有品种，你知道的，仿佛他来自另一个时空。"

"I see," Rei said. "What does the word 'boyfriend' means?"  
"我明白了，" 丽说。"‘男朋友’这个词是什么意思？"

Asuka chuckled. "Okay… It simply means your lover, your opposite, and perhaps… Your future husband," she replied.  
明日香轻笑一声。"好吧… 简单来说，就是你的爱人，你的另一半，或许… 还有可能是你未来的丈夫，" 她回答道。

"Husband?"

"When you get married afterwards," Asuka said, "that's what he'll be referred to, and you'll be the wife, and oh, if you ever get to beget _children_, you'll be considered as a _mother_."  
"之后你结婚时，" 明日香说，"他就是你丈夫，而你是妻子，哦，如果你有机会生孩子，你还会被视为母亲。"

Rei blinked this time, the word _mother_ causing a flashback to an afternoon, back to the elevator where she was then talking to Shinji:  
这次轮到绫波眨眼了，'母亲'这个词让她回想起一个下午，回到电梯里，那时她正和真嗣交谈：

_"When we were cleaning the classroom today," he recalled, "you were wringing out the rag, remember? The way you did it… Well, just like the way a mother does."  
"今天我们打扫教室的时候，" 他回忆道，"你在拧干抹布，记得吗？你那样做……嗯，就像母亲那样。"_

_Rei had a double-take. "A mother?"  
丽愣了一下。“母亲？”_

_Shinji smiled. "I thought it was like a mother does. Maybe you'd be really good at being a housewife, Ayanami," he said before bursting into laughter.  
真嗣笑了。“我觉得像母亲一样。也许你会很擅长做家庭主妇，绫波，”他说完便爆发出笑声。_

_Rei's composure broke, and she questioned as if offended, "What are you saying?"  
丽的镇定被打破了，她带着一丝被冒犯的语气问道：“你在说什么？”_

_The girl's reaction caused Shinji to pause, and he said, "Sorry… I didn't mean to hurt you, but that's how I think about the way you did it back there."  
女孩的反应让真嗣顿了一下，他说：“对不起……我不是有意要伤害你，但这就是我对刚才那件事的看法。”_

"_I could not understand why you have to laugh at me about it," Rei replied, unable to see the humor in Shinji's commentary._  
“我不明白你为什么要为此取笑我，”绫波回答，无法理解真嗣评论中的幽默。

_Shinji sighed. "I wished you should have at least a sense of humor," he said. "The only time I saw you smile was back there at that mountain, yet I don't know when you could laugh."  
真嗣叹了口气。“我希望你至少有点幽默感，”他说，“我唯一一次看到你笑是在那座山上，但我不知道你何时能笑出声。”_

_The First Children bowed her head, remembering their midnight sortie at Mount Futagoyama. "I am not trained to laugh," she admitted sadly. "The Commander does not laugh."  
第一子低下头，回忆起他们在富岳山深夜的突袭。“我没有受过笑的训练，”她悲伤地承认，“指挥官从不笑。”_

"_Why?" Shinji asked, frowning a bit._  
“为什么？”真嗣略显困惑地皱眉问道。

"_I could not be happy unlike you."_  
“我无法像你那样快乐。”

Rei was suddenly roused out of her brief reverie when Asuka snapped her fingers, despite being deep in LCL, as though doing it right in front of her face. "Cat got your tongue, Rei?" she asked.  
丽突然从短暂的沉思中惊醒，尽管身处 LCL 中，明日香在她面前打了个响指，仿佛就在她眼前。“猫把你的舌头叼走了吗，丽？”她问道。

"Pardon me?" Rei answered, blinking again.  
“请原谅？”丽回答，再次眨了眨眼。

Asuka giggled, patiently yet humorously having to put up with Rei's inability to understand some idioms. "I mean, you looked as if something kept you from talking. It's an idiom."  
明日香咯咯笑了起来，耐心却又幽默地忍受着丽对某些习语理解上的困难。“我是说，你看起来像是有话却说不出来。这是个习语。”

"I see," Rei said. "I am sorry; I remembered what Ikari said to me before because you said the word _mother_."  
"我明白了，" 丽说。"我很抱歉；因为你提到了'母亲'这个词，我想起了碇之前对我说的话。"

The redhead wistfully smiled. "It's all right; you're starting to learn a lot of things from me, and to have your vocabulary widened, Rei. Anyway… I couldn't imagine how it'll be like if your relationship lasts longer, but if in case you get married someday, I'm willing to become your bridesmaid… and mark my words, no kidding, I'll do that for you."  
红发女孩 wistfully 微笑着。"没关系；你开始从我这里学到很多东西，词汇量也在扩大，丽。无论如何…我无法想象如果你的关系持续更久会是什么样子，但如果有一天你结婚，我愿意成为你的伴娘…记住我的话，不开玩笑，我会为你这么做。"

"For me?"

This time Asuka sighed in pleasure, and she was enjoying the exchange between them. "Look," she said. "As you've saved me from that big freaking bird in the sky, from having that thing almost close to frying my brain, I owe you much for that, and so I want to be your bridesmaid someday. That's a highest honor a bride could get for having a best friend, and… All right, let's get back to Kaworu, and through him, I think you can learn how to be a real person."  
这次明日香满意地叹了口气，她享受着他们之间的交流。"看，"她说。"你救了我，让我免于被那只巨大的鸟在空中几乎烤焦大脑，我欠你很多，所以我想有一天成为你的伴娘。这是新娘能得到的最高荣誉，拥有一个最好的朋友，而且…好吧，让我们回到薰的话题上，通过他，我想你可以学会如何成为一个真正的人。"

Rei blinked. "I could do that?"  
丽眨了眨眼。“我可以做到吗？”

"Of course, you have potential to understand," Asuka said. "I mean, you're like an empty chalkboard or a blank piece of paper, a plain canvas or a chunk of clay, waiting for an artist to create something beautiful out of it by sketching, painting or sculpting… and that artist is Kaworu, and then all the sudden you come out with some sense and... You're bringing out your heart into the open."  
“当然，你有理解的潜力，”明日香说。“我是说，你就像一块空白的黑板或一张白纸，一张纯白的画布或一块黏土，等待着艺术家通过素描、绘画或雕塑来创造出美丽的东西……而那位艺术家就是薰，然后突然间你就能领悟一些东西，并且……你在敞开心扉。”

The First Children nodded in agreement. "I see…"  
第一适格者点头表示同意。“我明白了……”

"There's something else I noticed about Kaworu, though," Asuka said. "He reminds me about this character from a book I read sometimes ago; he's like Edward Cullen, from _Twilight_, and he's a mysterious guy."  
"不过，关于渚薰，我还注意到了其他一些事情，"明日香说。"他让我想起了我之前读过的一本书里的角色；他就像《暮光之城》里的爱德华·卡伦，是个神秘的家伙。"

"I have never read that book," Rei admitted.  
"我从未读过那本书，"绫波承认道。"

"Well," Asuka said, "perhaps later we'll see if _Twilight_'s in the NERV library, and maybe the rest of the whole saga, and then we could borrow all four books and then read them together in your spare time, and only then you could get the idea of what I mean."  
"好吧，"明日香说，"也许晚些时候我们可以去 NERV 图书馆看看有没有《暮光之城》，或许还有整个系列的其他书，然后我们可以借这四本书，在空闲时间一起读，只有这样你才能明白我的意思。"

Rei nodded. "That would be acceptable… But why call him mysterious?"  
丽点了点头。“那倒是可行……但为何称他为神秘呢？”

"Because I don't know much about Kaworu, so I'm interested in asking him a few questions, like what he really is and where he came from. But since you have probably known him intimately, is it okay if you could tell me more about Kaworu?"  
“因为我对渚薰了解不多，所以很想问问他一些问题，比如他究竟是什么人，从哪里来。但既然你大概与他关系密切，能否请你多告诉我一些关于渚薰的事情呢？”

This time Rei was in a quandary; she and Kaworu made a solemn pledge not to tell the secret of his origins, employers and true Angelic identity.  
这次轮到丽陷入两难；她和渚薰曾郑重承诺，不泄露他的出身秘密、雇主以及他真正的天使身份。

"I could not answer that," Rei confessed after a while.  
"我无法回答那个问题，" 丽过了一会儿坦白道。

Asuka frowned. "Why not?"  
明日香皱眉。"为什么不能？"

"It is a secret we share, we promised ourselves not to tell anyone, and we must honor that promise," Rei answered.  
"这是我们共同的秘密，我们曾承诺不向任何人透露，我们必须遵守这个承诺，" 丽回答道。

"Aw," Asuka grumbled as if hurt. "Sounds just like in the book, a secret forbidden affair between a mortal girl and a vampire boy, and they vowed not to tell the world about it, not even to the girl's dad, and of course vampires hate to see their secrets exposed."  
"啊，" 明日香咕哝着，仿佛受了伤。"听起来就像书里写的那样，一个凡人女孩和吸血鬼男孩之间的秘密禁忌之恋，他们发誓不告诉任何人，甚至不告诉女孩的父亲，当然吸血鬼也讨厌看到他们的秘密被揭露。"

"That is exactly what Kaworu and I are doing," Rei said, immediately seeing parallels between that and her relationship with Kaworu, and then she looked around as though wary of potential eavesdroppers. "I do not wish the Commander to know we are in love," she added.  
"那正是我和渚薰正在做的事情，" 绫波说，立刻在书中情节和与渚薰的关系之间看到了相似之处，然后她环顾四周，仿佛担心有潜在的偷听者。"我不希望司令官知道我们在相爱，"她补充道。"

Asuka nodded, and made a 'quiet' gesture with a forefinger touching her lips. "All right, I promise you we'll keep this conversation confidential," she avowed, using the same forefinger to make a cross over her heart. "Agree?"  
明日香点点头，用食指触碰嘴唇做出一个"安静"的手势。"好吧，我向你保证我们会保守这次谈话的秘密，"她宣誓道，用同一根手指在胸前画了一个十字。"同意吗？"

Rei smiled softly. "I agree, Pilot Soryu," she replied.  
丽微微一笑。“我同意，碇司令，”她回答道。

A thought crossed Asuka's mind, and then she said, "One more thing, and I forgot to mention this."  
明日香脑海中闪过一个念头，接着她说道：“还有一件事，我忘了提。”

"What is it?" Rei wondered.  
“什么事？”丽好奇地问。

"Do you remember what you said about opening my heart to Eva?"  
"你还记得你说过要我向绫波敞开心扉吗？"

Rei nodded. "Yes, I know that."  
绫波点了点头。"是的，我知道。"

Asuka gave her a grin. "Well… You were darned right in saying so," she spoke, tapping her hand on one of the controls. "Therefore I should treat you for a free lunch after this, and so… what do you wish to have for lunch?"  
明日香对她露出了笑容。"那么…你说得一点没错，"她一边说着，一边用手轻敲着其中一个控制器。"所以这次之后我该请你吃顿免费的午餐，那么…你午饭想吃什么？"

"Garlic noodles with dumplings," Rei said; it was probably the only supreme gourmet meal she really liked.  
“蒜香面条配饺子，”丽说道；这可能是她真正喜欢的唯一一道顶级美食。

"…And _Kaworu_ for dessert, maybe?" Asuka quipped, before bursting into laughter; briefly she enjoyed a seemingly delicious imagining of Rei going down to bed with Kaworu after lunch.  
“……或许饭后甜点是薰？”明日香打趣道，随即爆发出笑声；她短暂地享受了一番想象中丽在午餐后与薰共枕的诱人画面。

But Rei looked surprised, with eyes blinking. "What did you say?"  
但丽看起来很惊讶，眼睛眨了眨。“你说什么？”

The redhead repeatedly shook her head, still chortling. "No, no, no… Sorry, Rei, don't get mad… I'm just _joking_!" she pleaded.  
红发女孩不停地摇头，还在咯咯笑。“不，不，不……对不起，丽，别生气……我只是在开玩笑！”她恳求道。

Spotting an empty chair, Misato pulled it towards her and sat down on it, before she asked, "This is becoming serious. Why you should betray him?"  
看到一把空椅子，美里把它拉过来坐下，然后问道：“这事儿越来越严重了。你为什么要背叛他？”

Kaworu remained standing. "I don't want to give Shinji undue pain, but I'm supposed to die in the hands of Unit One, as a sacrifice. That I'm preordained to be so, as the prophecies in the Scrolls say."  
渚薰依然站着。“我不想给真嗣带来不必要的痛苦，但我注定要在初号机手中牺牲，作为祭品。正如《卷轴》中的预言所说，这是我的宿命。”

The woman blinked. "Scrolls? What sort of scrolls have to do with this?"  
女人眨了眨眼。“卷轴？什么样的卷轴与这有关？”

"The Secret Dead Sea Scrolls are the basis for what's happening here. It's more of a plan than a prophecy; my predecessors are already dead, slain by the Evas, confirming the entries in those Scrolls. As _Tabris_, which is really my name, I'm the seventeenth, and the _last_ of my kind, to serve as a sacrificial lamb."  
“秘密死海古卷是这里发生一切的基础。与其说是预言，不如说是一个计划；我的前辈们已经死去，被 EVA 所杀，证实了那些古卷中的记载。作为 Tabris，实际上是我的真名，我是第十七位，也是最后一位，作为牺牲品。”

Misato was astonished. "Those Scrolls do exist? Really?"  
美里感到震惊。“那些古卷真的存在吗？真的？”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, and as they're called 'Secret', they're separate from the other Dead Sea Scrolls that are for study in Israel today. Anyway, the Chairman personally showed the Scrolls to me a week before I came here, just to give me an idea of what I was meant to do… Now, going back to Shinji, I understood what's wrong with him. I learned about his past, the pain he was going through, the doubts he carried, and the fact he's in odds with his father."  
渚薰点头道：“是的，既然它们被称为‘秘密’，就与目前在以色列供研究的那些死海古卷不同。无论如何，在我来这里的前一周，碇源堂亲自向我展示了这些古卷，只是为了让我明白我将要做什么……现在，回到真嗣身上，我理解了他的问题所在。我了解他的过去，他所经历的痛苦，他所怀的疑虑，以及他与父亲之间的矛盾。”

"What did you know about him?"  
“你对他的了解有多少？”

Kaworu took a breath. "I have now understood why he didn't want to be a Pilot," he said. "Why he didn't like his father and blame him for his suffering and the loss of his mother, and why he tried to run away. He sought for escape from the pain, to come back to his comfortable old life, yet there's no other place for him to go, except here and now. He also came close to losing most of his friends and people close to him. Above all, before I met him, he always hated himself; his lack of self-worth and courage was so appalling that it's no wonder that most people rejected him, and others beat him up."  
渚薰深吸了一口气。“我现在明白了为什么他不想成为驾驶员，”他说，“为什么他不喜欢他的父亲，并把他的痛苦和母亲的去世归咎于父亲，以及为什么他试图逃跑。他寻求从痛苦中解脱，回到他舒适的旧生活，然而除了这里和现在，他没有其他地方可去。他也几乎失去了大部分朋友和亲近的人。最重要的是，在我遇见他之前，他总是憎恨自己；他缺乏自我价值和勇气，这令人震惊，难怪大多数人拒绝他，其他人则殴打他。”

Misato couldn't believe it. "How did you manage to obtain all that?"  
美里简直不敢相信。“你怎么弄到这些的？”

"Because I have this power, and I discovered it by accident. I have the ability to read people's minds by physical contact."  
“因为我有这种力量，而且是无意中发现的。我可以通过身体接触读取别人的思想。”

"How?"

"Let me take your hidden side as an example," Kaworu began. "In your case, I have learned why you despise your dead father, because he's responsible for your broken family in your past, for he'd been too obsessed with his work, so you called him the most selfish man in the world, but then your feelings about him were torn up after he saved you from being killed in Second Impact; you also had a hard time with Kaji in an on-and-off relationship, thinking he's like your father, until his death, and yet you couldn't get over it. At the same time, you're searching for the truth, and maybe you wanted to end it on your own terms. Sometimes you feel guilty for failing the Children as a guardian. On top of it, alcohol is where you lose yourself, trying to erase the trauma. _In vino veritas._"  
“让我以你的隐藏面为例，”渚薰开始说道，“在你看来，你憎恨已故的父亲，因为他对你的破碎家庭负有责任，他过于沉迷于工作，所以你称他为世界上最自私的人，但在他救你免于第二次冲击中丧生后，你对他的感情变得复杂；你与加持的关系也是分分合合，认为他像你父亲一样，直到他去世，你仍无法释怀。同时，你在寻找真相，也许你想按自己的方式结束这一切。有时你会因为未能尽到守护孩子们的责任而感到内疚。除此之外，你借酒消愁，试图抹去创伤。酒后吐真言。”

Misato was totally shocked, a cold chill running through her veins; she felt as if she was stripped naked. "H… How did you do that? I mean… you read my mind like a book."  
美里完全震惊了，一股寒意贯穿全身；她感觉自己仿佛被剥光了衣服。“你……你是怎么做到的？我是说……你读我的心就像翻书一样。”

"Whenever I have _physical contact_ with any person for the first time," Kaworu explained, "I get this... psychic rush as if I could access their memories. I can see anyone's past through their senses. I discovered this part of me as I met Shinji for the first time, and so I was able to understand his pain and suffering, joy and pleasure. Besides him, and through that ability, I was also able to comprehend the problems that Asuka and Rei faced, which they struggled to resolve."  
“每当我第一次与任何人发生身体接触时，”薰解释道，“我就会感受到这种……心灵上的冲击，仿佛能够访问他们的记忆。我能通过他们的感官看到任何人的过去。我第一次遇见真嗣时就发现了这一点，因此我能够理解他的痛苦和苦难，以及他的快乐和愉悦。除了他，通过这种能力，我还能够理解明日香和绫波所面临的问题，这些问题让他们难以解决。”

This time the woman heaved a relieved sigh, and then she asked, "What understanding have you gained from them? How did you help the girls?"  
这次女人松了一口气，然后问道：“你从他们那里得到了什么理解？你是如何帮助她们的？”

"Asuka's biggest problem is her past and her mother's suicide," Kaworu said, "and instead of coming to terms with the pain it generated, she tried to cover it up by creating an outward personality for people to see, to make them think she's above them; she also repeatedly tried to convince people that she's mature, when in fact all that posturing only made her sound immature.  
「明日香最大的问题在于她的过去和母亲的自杀，」渚薰说道，「她没有去面对由此产生的痛苦，而是试图通过塑造一个外在形象来掩盖，让人们以为她高人一等；她还一再试图说服别人她很成熟，但实际上这种装腔作势只让她显得更加幼稚。」

"Once I made physical contact, the first thing I did was to talk to her about it, try to change for the good, and make peace with her past and inner demons."  
「一旦我与她有了身体接触，我首先做的就是和她谈这件事，试图向好的方向改变，与她的过去和内心的恶魔和解。」

Kaworu combed his hair with a free hand, and continued. "As for Rei… She had this inferiority complex, a feeling she's expendable, as if she wished to die. Ever since she blew up Unit Zero she couldn't remember, she had this self-doubt, questioning the importance of her purpose to the Commander, and with those, she possessed this fear that she couldn't continue the relationships she had with others, especially with Shinji.  
渚薰用一只空闲的手梳理着头发，继续说道：「至于绫波……她有自卑情结，觉得自己是可有可无的，仿佛她渴望死去。自从她炸毁零号机后记忆丧失，她就开始自我怀疑，质疑自己对司令官的重要性，并且她害怕无法继续维持与他人的关系，尤其是与真嗣的关系。」

"But after Unit One rejected her, and somehow she had her memories back, all the sudden she wanted to live, and so I helped her try to understand her problems and resolve them, especially her self-worth."  
"但在初号机拒绝了她，而她又不知怎么恢复了记忆之后，她突然想要活下去，于是我帮助她试图理解自己的问题并解决它们，尤其是她的自我价值。"

"And what about me?"  
"那我呢？"

"You're at a mature age and time," Kaworu said, "in which it's really up to you to let go of yesterday's pain, and be stronger. You're still a good woman to me."  
"你正处于一个成熟的年龄和时期，""渚薰说，""是时候放下昨日的痛苦，变得更坚强了。在我眼中，你依然是个好女人。"

Misato nodded. "Yeah, but I did my best being a better person. Didn't think much of the past now, except maybe the good times. Yet even then the past comes back with a vengeance, and I still have to wrestle with them. But still… Did you learn something worthwhile in making us look into our hearts?"  
美里点头道：“是啊，但我尽力做一个更好的人。现在不太去想过去的事，除了那些美好的时光。然而，过去总会以复仇的姿态卷土重来，我仍需与之搏斗。不过……在让我们审视内心时，你有没有学到什么有价值的东西？”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, I do."  
薰点头道：“是的，我确实学到了。”

"Why?"

"I don't want to be a mere observer of pain and suffering; I don't want to be too selfish, and instead I gave myself, counseling them to recoup their will, give them encouragement and a will to live… But I'm really preparing them for a contingency," Kaworu said, before he leaned close to Misato and added, "Whether we want it or not, Instrumentality is coming."  
“我不想仅仅成为痛苦和苦难的旁观者；我不想过于自私，而是选择奉献自己，引导他们重拾意志，给予他们鼓励和生存的意志……但实际上，我是在为他们准备应对突发情况，”薰说道，随后他靠近美里补充道，“无论我们是否愿意，人类补完计划即将到来。”

In her lab, with her iPod plugged onto the Bose speaker set, softly playing songs from Sheryl Crow, and while she was transmitting more of Oda's data from the hard drive to Hamamoto's computer over NERV's intranet, Ritsuko stared once more at the old picture on her laptop; in the ten-plus-years-old picture, she was present with her mother, another one of her mother's colleagues, and Gendo; the adults all wearing lab coats while Ritsuko donned a school uniform: beige coat and skirt, a white shirt and a black bow.  
在她的实验室里，iPod 连接着 Bose 音箱，轻柔地播放着 Sheryl Crow 的歌曲，同时她正通过 NERV 的内部网络将更多 Oda 的数据从硬盘传输到 Hamamoto 的电脑上。Ritsuko 再次凝视着笔记本上的那张旧照片；在这张十年以上的照片中，她与母亲、母亲的一位同事以及 Gendo 同框，大人们都穿着实验室外套，而 Ritsuko 则穿着校服：米色外套和裙子，白色衬衫和黑色领结。

In the picture, while her mother smiled, and Gendo stared at the camera as if he was about to blow out its lenses with his piercing eyes, Ritsuko looked gloomy and uncomfortable. Of course, with the dark chestnut brown hair matching her mother's, Ritsuko then looked too homely in that picture, and her lanky physical appearance sometimes made her a subject of countless taunts back in high school, the girls calling her a wallflower behind her back.  
在照片中，母亲微笑着，Gendo 则盯着镜头，仿佛要用他那锐利的眼神将镜头击穿，而 Ritsuko 显得忧郁且不自在。当然，与母亲同色的深栗色头发让 Ritsuko 在那张照片中显得过于朴素，她瘦削的身形在高中时也常成为众人嘲讽的对象，女生们在背后称她为壁花。

A bit disgusted of her former ugly-duckling self, Ritsuko promptly closed the picture and then thought of accessing her old, web-based account at Google Mail, which she logged in periodically to keep it alive and checking the inbox. So far, unlike her current NERV email account, this one received little now, the most recent message dated about six years ago. She owned this account ever since she started studying at college, used it to keep in touch with her mother, then working for Gehirn, on a nightly basis.  
对于曾经那个丑小鸭般的自己感到一丝厌恶，律子迅速关闭了照片，转而想到访问她那个老旧的基于网络的 Google Mail 账户，她定期登录以保持活跃并检查收件箱。到目前为止，与她目前的 NERV 电子邮件账户不同，这个账户几乎没有什么新邮件，最近的一封也是六年前的事了。自从她开始上大学以来，她就拥有了这个账户，用它每晚与当时在 Gehirn 工作的母亲保持联系。

Now, with the laptop connected to the Internet, Ritsuko entered the Google Mail website and logged in with her username and password, then went to find some older correspondence with her mother, and opened each of them:  
现在，随着笔记本电脑连接到互联网，律子进入了 Google Mail 网站，用她的用户名和密码登录，然后去寻找一些与母亲的旧通信，并逐一打开它们：

_Mom, the other day, I happened to meet a girl named Katsuragi, and people always do stare at me from a distance, because they know I'm your daughter. It forces me to remember that your name is very important. Well, as far as Misato's concerned (that's her name), she's different. She's really honest, even with me. I heard that she's the only survivor left from her late father's Investigation Commission. It seems that she was aphasic before… I mean, unable to speak well. But now she's quite talkative, just like she's trying to make up for those aphasic days. Anyway, if you want to see what she looks like, here's a picture of me with her. OBTW Sorry Mom, I changed the color of my hair. I look better with platinum blonde.

Rit-chan, I'm sorry but I'm always underground, working down here with my development team, especially on the new supercomputer. As I've already signed the NDA, however, I can't tell you much about the details or even the name of this project. But I'm getting sick of buying box lunches, and I really miss eating out at a real ramen stand. And you don't want to get lost here, either, as it's like a maze; you'll have to carry a map if you want to go around or find a WC (water closet = public toilet) somewhere._ _Aboveground, though, the construction of Tokyo-3 has started, as a result of the government's plan to move the capital for the second time, even if they haven't thought of providing some place for those dumb politicians just like the old Diet building back before the Impact… which is a good thing._  
Rit-chan，对不起，我总是在地下，和我的开发团队一起工作，特别是关于新的超级计算机。虽然我已经签署了保密协议，但我不能告诉你太多细节，甚至连这个项目的名字都不能透露。但我已经厌倦了买盒饭，真的很怀念在真正的拉面摊上吃饭。而且你也不想在这里迷路，这里就像个迷宫；如果你想四处走走或找厕所（WC=公共厕所），你得带上地图。不过，地面上，东京-3 的建设已经开始，这是政府第二次迁都计划的结果，尽管他们还没有想过为那些愚蠢的政客提供一个像旧国会大厦那样的地方……这是一件好事。

_For a couple of days, Misato was absent from school, and I forced her to tell me why. She's such a horny idiot! Turned out she was having serious sex with her boyfriend at her apartment, without getting tired… for a WHOLE WEEK! Imagine that! Yet however, even if I have to put up with her manners, I was still impressed to hear about that other side of her._ _Today, while at lunch she introduced me to the guy. His name's Ryoji Kaji and he's studying philosophy, but he prefers to be called by his family name. He's handsome, but I'm not used to his playfulness. Check out my phone pic on him, he's very much of a slacker:  
有几天，美里没来学校，我逼她告诉我原因。她真是个色情白痴！原来她和男朋友在她公寓里激烈地做爱，一点儿也不觉得累……整整一个星期！你能想象吗！尽管如此，即使我得忍受她的行为，听到她的这一面我还是感到惊讶。_今天，午餐时她向我介绍了那个男生。他叫加持良治，学哲学的，但他更喜欢别人叫他的姓。他很帅，但我还不习惯他的调皮。看看我手机里他的照片，他真是个懒散的家伙：

_You've been too afraid of boys for a long time, Rit-chan. That's because I'm the only one trying to raise you. I'm so sorry; I've always let you do as you wanted… I'm terrible, and I'm your mother only when I wish to be. I don't want to think too much about your father.  
你一直对男孩过于害怕，理子酱。那是因为只有我在努力抚养你。对不起，我总是让你随心所欲……我太糟糕了，只有在我愿意的时候，我才算是你的母亲。我不想过多地考虑你的父亲。_

"You said today's important, so I want to show the promising future to my son." Those were the last words I heard from Yui-san, before a freak accident during the first contact experiment erased her from this world... Just as I had mistakenly wished, and so I feel disgusted about myself._ _After that day, however, Chief Ikari completely changed. He left after the brief funeral for her, and been absent for two days till now. Either he's arranging some of her papers or probably gone on drinking, just like most brokenhearted widowers, but I'll never know and I don't even know much about him. He's still an unknown quantity._  
“你说今天很重要，所以我想要向我的儿子展示一个有希望的未来。”这是我在第一次接触实验中发生意外之前，从优子小姐那里听到的最后一句话……正如我错误地希望的那样，她从这个世界上消失了……这让我对自己感到厌恶。_然而，在那之后，碇司令彻底改变了。他在她的简短葬礼后离开，直到现在已经有两天没出现了。他可能在整理她的文件，或者像大多数心碎的鳏夫一样去喝酒了，但我永远不会知道，我对他了解不多。他仍然是一个未知数。

主题：恭喜！  
_Mom, congratulations on completing the basic theory of the MAGI trinary system. However, I have some good news to congratulate you with: I received the employment notice in the mail, and they said that I will officially join Gehirn next week, and by next month, I'll also be assigned to Project E. I hope I made you proud this time. Looking forward to working alongside you.  
妈妈，恭喜您完成了 MAGI 三元系统的基础理论。不过，我也有好消息要向您报喜：我收到了工作通知，下周将正式加入 Gehirn，下个月还将被分配到 E 计划。希望这次能让您感到骄傲。期待与您并肩工作。_

Ritsuko sighed as she logged off her Google account, and pondered about her past actions. She wondered why she blindly fell for Gendo, even as that man was probably responsible for her mother's death.  
律子叹了口气，退出谷歌账号，沉思着自己的过往。她不明白为何会盲目地爱上源堂，即便那个男人可能与她母亲的死有关。

It was his _eyes_ that changed her mind, those eyes behind his amber-tinted glasses. They can turn soft if he wished, to gain sympathy or to bring down the resistance of anyone who spoke to him. Perhaps it's no wonder he can easily negotiate with difficult men, or cunningly manipulate people to his will, make them do anything at his bidding.  
正是他的眼睛改变了她的想法，那双隐藏在琥珀色镜片后的眼睛。它们能变得柔和，如果他愿意的话，以博取同情或瓦解任何与他交谈者的抵抗。或许这并不奇怪，他能轻易与难缠的人谈判，或狡猾地操纵他人服从他的意志，让他们按他的吩咐行事。

However, his eyes can also become freezing-cold if angered, terrorizing the weak-willed and anyone who dared to be standing in his way, without even raising a voice. Ritsuko sometimes heard rumors from lower-ranked personnel, of Gendo's behavior, and how they tried to put up with his eccentricities; depending on someone's opinion, and only when he's not around, either they called him a messianic visionary or a flaming bastard.  
然而，他的眼神也能变得冰冷刺骨，一旦发怒，便能震慑意志薄弱者及任何胆敢挡在他面前的人，无需提高嗓门。有时，律子会从低阶人员那里听到关于源堂行为的传闻，以及他们如何忍受他的古怪；根据不同人的看法，且仅在他不在场时，有人称他为救世主般的远见者，也有人骂他是狂妄的混蛋。

Suddenly Ritsuko realized that he could enter her lab without warning, and maybe hurt her, so out of fear she stood up and went to the door, hung a "Don't Disturb" sign and locked it, before going back to her seat. She then lit up another cigarette and pulled a drag.  
突然间，律子意识到他可能会无预警地闯入她的实验室，甚至可能伤害她，出于恐惧，她站起身走向门口，挂上“请勿打扰”的牌子并锁上门，然后才回到座位。她随即点燃另一支烟，深深吸了一口。

"Sonofabitch," she cursed Gendo, as a whitish cloud of spent tobacco formed around her. "I shouldn't have let you touch me in the first place."  
"混蛋," 她咒骂着碇源堂, 一圈白色的烟雾在她周围形成。"我一开始就不该让你碰我。"

"I heard the words 'Instrumentality' or 'Complementation' many times," Misato said. "Some call it a new age for humanity, others a second renaissance… Yet because it's too vague, exactly what the hell it actually means?"  
"我多次听到'人类补完计划'或'补全'这样的词," 美里说。"有人称之为人类的新纪元, 有人称之为第二次文艺复兴……然而因为它太过模糊, 到底它真正意味着什么?"

Kaworu sighed. "Maybe I'll enlighten you on that, but I'm afraid you may not like the possibilities Instrumentality may bring upon the Lilim."  
渚薰叹了口气。"或许我可以为你阐明这一点, 但我担心你可能不会喜欢人类补完计划给莉莉姆带来的可能性。"

Misato nodded. "Okay, I'll listen... What's Instrumentality is all about?"  
美里点头。“好的，我会听的……什么是人类补完计划？”

As Kaworu explained, the Human Instrumentality Project was a plan aimed at divinity, and the Evas were considered absolutely essential to the Project; as copies of Adam, the being closest to a god, the Evas were the sole keys that could open the Path to God.  
正如渚薰所解释的，人类补完计划是一个旨在成神的项目，而 EVA 被认为是该项目绝对必要的；作为最接近神的存在的亚当的复制品，EVA 是唯一能打开通往神之路的钥匙。

However, being an incomplete creation, humanity possessed this void, and the Committee believed that they could use Eva to fill in this gap, and to make man into a God through apotheosis, or at least into an eternal existence.  
然而，作为一个不完整的创造物，人类拥有这个空缺，委员会相信他们可以利用 EVA 来填补这个空白，并通过神化使人类成为神，或者至少成为一个永恒的存在。

"There's a problem, though," Misato said. "Who's going to benefit from Instrumentality? Us… or the Committee?"  
"不过有个问题，"美里说。"谁会从人类补完计划中获益？是我们……还是委员会？"

"I fear that the Committee demands it," Kaworu said. "They feel humanity has reached a point where mankind has become corrupt, redemption is impossible, and thus Instrumentality is their only way to accomplish purity and atonement, and to become one entity."  
"我担心委员会要求这么做，"渚薰说。"他们认为人类已经堕落到无法救赎的地步，因此人类补完计划是他们实现纯洁与赎罪，以及成为一个整体的唯一途径。"

Misato blinked. "A world… _without sin_," she whispered, remembering that phrase she heard from the movie _Serenity_.  
美里眨了眨眼。"一个……没有罪恶的世界，"她低声说道，想起了电影《宁静》中的那句话。

"Exactly. That's what they wanted."  
“确实。这就是他们想要的。”

"Damn," Misato cursed, shaking her head. "But there's something I wanted to tell you, now that I'm sure we could keep this all a secret to ourselves."  
“该死，”美里咒骂道，摇了摇头。“但现在我有件事想告诉你，既然我确信我们可以把这一切保密。”

"What is it?" Kaworu responded.  
“什么事？”渚薰回应道。

"Why there are _two_ Adams?" she questioned.  
"为什么有两个亚当？" 她问道。

Kaworu frowned a bit. "Two?"  
渚薰微微皱眉。"两个？"

"Yes, there are two," Misato said, nodding. "One I've seen at the bottom of the Geofront sometimes ago… and the other sketched out by our doctor friend. You know, Doctor Odani."  
"是的，有两个，" 美里点头道，"一个我曾在不久前在 Geofront 底部见过……另一个则是我们的医生朋友绘制的。你知道的，小谷医生。"

"No, it's impossible. There's only _one_ Adam."  
"不，这不可能。只有一个亚当。"

Misato looked puzzled. "And what's the other, then?"  
美里看起来很困惑。"那么另一个是什么？"

"The other is named Lilith."  
"另一个名叫莉莉丝。"

"Lilith?"

"Yes. They maybe look one and the same, but they're fundamentally different. But they're only one-half of themselves, as each of them doesn't have souls of their own. Only when they have a soul do they become fully awaken."  
"是的。它们或许看起来一模一样，但本质上却截然不同。然而，它们各自只拥有一半的自我，因为没有灵魂的它们并不完整。只有当它们拥有了灵魂，才能真正觉醒。"

"And where are those souls?"  
"那么，那些灵魂在哪里？"

"I carry the soul of Adam… and Rei possesses the soul of Lilith."  
"我承载着亚当的灵魂……而丽拥有莉莉丝的灵魂。"

Once more Misato was dumbstruck, mouth agape.  
米萨托再次哑口无言，嘴巴张得大大的。

"That's right," Kaworu confirmed. "But… Who's in control of Adam?"  
"没错，"渚确认道。"但是…谁在控制亚当？"

"Damn, I should've told you this: according to Doctor Odani, the Commander owns Adam, as she operated on his hand some nights ago."  
"该死，我早该告诉你的：根据小谷博士的说法，司令拥有亚当，因为她前几天晚上给他做了手部手术。"

"I didn't know that," Kaworu said.  
"我不知道这一点，"渚薰说道。

Misato nodded. "Yes, but we don't really know what he's going to do with it."  
美里点头。"是的，但我们并不真正了解他会用它做什么。"

"There's only one way: he could use it for Instrumentality," Kaworu answered.  
"只有一种可能：他可能用它来实现人类补完计划，"渚薰回答道。

The woman's eyes bulged. "WHAT?"  
女人的眼睛瞪得溜圆。“什么？”

"You may not really like to hear this first part of Instrumentality, but since we are only vessels for their souls, and we're also made from their genetic material, if either of us makes _physical_ contact with either Lilith or Adam, then Instrumentality begins: their souls, bottled in me and Rei and then released, would be fused with their bodies, and it doesn't matter whether it's Adam's soul and Lilith's body, or vice-versa, or in combination, as long as a _body_ receives a _soul_, not body-to-body nor soul-to-soul."  
“你可能不太喜欢听到关于人类补完计划的第一部分，但既然我们只是他们灵魂的容器，而且我们也是由他们的基因材料制成的，如果我们中的任何一个与莉莉丝或亚当发生物理接触，那么人类补完计划就会开始：他们的灵魂，被封存在我和绫波体内，然后释放出来，将与他们的身体融合，无论是亚当的灵魂与莉莉丝的身体，还是反过来，或者两者结合，只要一个身体接收到了灵魂，无论是身体对身体的接触还是灵魂对灵魂的接触都无关紧要。”

The woman swallowed hard, trying to imagine the process. "And what happens?"  
女人艰难地咽了口唾沫，试图想象这个过程。“那会发生什么？”

"There will be a reversal of the AT-Field that binds the physical forms of _all_ creatures made from Lilith… Or Adam; whether they're plants or animals, bacterium or Lilim, without the AT-Field they will be broken down and liquefied into LCL. There's no escape, no choice given, and all will be returned to the first form of life."  
"AT 力场将会反转，束缚由莉莉丝…或亚当所创造的所有生物的物理形态…无论是植物、动物、细菌还是莉莉姆，没有 AT 力场，它们将被分解并液化成 LCL。无处可逃，无从选择，一切都将回归生命的最初形态。"

"Which is called primordial soup," Misato said, but Kaworu's description of the process was already chilling her veins.  
"也就是所谓的原始汤，"美里说道，但渚薰对这一过程的描述已经让她感到不寒而栗。"

"Yes," Kaworu confirmed. "And as you have told me, a world without sin... and that disintegration's the second and last part."  
"是的，"渚薰确认道。"正如你告诉我的，一个没有罪恶的世界...而这种分解是第二步，也是最后一步。"

Misato frowned and she said, "Now what are we going to do, kidnap the Commander and try to pry Adam off him? Impossible. Short of being suicidal, there's _no way_ anyone with hostile intent could hope to get near, and whenever he goes out, he always has armed bodyguards and they're trained to shoot to kill… As if that wasn't worrying enough, the Commander himself packs a gun and knows how to shoot; on occasions I've seen him practice down at the gun range."  
美里皱起眉头，说道：“现在我们该怎么办，绑架司令官然后试图从他身上夺走亚当吗？不可能。除非是自杀，否则任何怀有敌意的人都无法靠近他，而且他每次外出都总是有武装保镖跟随，他们受过训练，会毫不犹豫地开枪……更别提司令官自己随身携带枪支，并且知道如何射击；我曾见过他在射击场练习。”

Kaworu now looked desperate, as he pondered over the dilemma, trying to find a way as Misato watched him.  
渚薰现在显得十分焦急，他陷入沉思，试图找到解决办法，而美里在一旁观察着他。

"I have a plan, and I worked on it last night," he said, breaking the uneasy silence.  
“我有一个计划，昨晚我一直在完善它，”他打破了不安的沉默，说道。

"But what plan?" Misato asked, looking doubtful.  
"但什么计划？" 美里问道，脸上带着怀疑。

"I want them to see what they're expecting to witness. To see is to believe, isn't it?"  
"我想让他们看到他们期待见证的东西。眼见为实，不是吗？"

"Right," Misato nodded, "and how do you want it to work?"  
"对，" 美里点头，"那你打算怎么实施呢？"

The next few minutes Misato listened to Kaworu, as he explained the scheme in detail. In theory it was elegant and ingenious, and thus the woman was reminded much of the movie _Ocean's Eleven_ and its plot_,_ but to make his complex plan work would be daunting.  
接下来的几分钟里，美里听着渚薰详细解释他的计划。理论上，这个计划既优雅又巧妙，让她不禁想起了电影《十一罗汉》及其剧情，但要实现这个复杂的计划却相当艰巨。

"Do you think it's going to fly?" Misato asked, completely skeptical afterwards. She glanced at her watch, and there were only a few minutes left before Unit-02's stability test concludes.  
“你觉得这能行得通吗？”美里完全持怀疑态度地问道。她瞥了一眼手表，距离二号机稳定性测试结束只剩下几分钟了。

"It maybe a long shot, but I want it that way," Kaworu answered. "As long we don't tell them about this plan," he added, referring to the other Children.  
“虽然希望渺茫，但我希望如此，”渚薰回答道，“只要我们不告诉其他孩子们这个计划。”他补充道。

"What if your crazy plan _fails_?" Misato asked.  
"如果你的疯狂计划失败了怎么办？" 美里问道。

"Then it's my fault and I'll accept the consequences should that happens," Kaworu said. "I'm not just doing it for myself; I'm doing this for the rest of us, all because she wants to live."  
"那么那就是我的错，如果发生那种情况，我会承担后果，" 渚说。"我不仅仅是为了自己；我这样做是为了我们所有人，只因为她想活下去。"

Misato shook her head, and sighed. "You know, there's a phrase for what you're doing."  
美里摇了摇头，叹了口气。"你知道吗，你这样做是有个说法的。

"What's that?"

"Love conquers all." "爱能战胜一切。"

"Ah. _Omnia vincit amor_," Kaworu said, translating it into Latin. "I know that. Virgil by way of Chaucer, yet there's more to that line than you think."  
"啊。Omnia vincit amor，" 渚薰用拉丁语翻译道，"我知道这个。维吉尔通过乔叟传下来的，不过这句话比你想象的要深刻。"

Misato was impressed. "Didn't know it's been around for a very long time."  
美里感到惊讶。"没想到这句话流传了这么久。"

"Yes," Kaworu said. "Anyway, my guardian, insisting that I should have a backbone in humanities, gave me a tutor in literature, who taught me everything on it from Greek to English, to American and European, and even Japanese, from folklore to modern.  
“是的，”渚薰说，“无论如何，我的监护人坚持认为我在人文方面应该有所建树，于是给我请了一位文学导师，他教我从希腊文学到英语，再到美国和欧洲文学，甚至包括日本文学，从民间传说到现代文学无所不包。”

"Now if a civilization is to be judged, it shouldn't be measured in terms of power, wealth and weaponry, but its high culture, especially its languages, songs, dances, music, paintings, stories, and poems... all forms of art."  
“现在如果要评价一个文明，不应该以权力、财富和武器来衡量，而应该看它的高级文化，特别是它的语言、歌曲、舞蹈、音乐、绘画、故事和诗歌……所有艺术形式。”

"You remind me of my humanities professor back in college," Misato recalled. "He once used to bring the house down with one of his lectures on Shakespeare."  
“你让我想起了大学时的人文教授，”美里回忆道，“他曾经有一次用关于莎士比亚的讲座让全场为之倾倒。”

"I'll take that as a compliment," Kaworu said, smiling.  
"我会把这当作一种赞美，" 渚薰微笑着说。

Misato sighed, and asked, this time looking serious. "Can you foresee how this will all end? I mean, after all the Angels, including you?"  
美里叹了口气，这次认真地问道："你能预见这一切将如何结束吗？我是说，包括你在内的所有使徒之后？"

"It's not easy to look into the future, and even I admit that the Scrolls may _not be absolute_ as they claim. On the contrary, as with other prophecies, they can't be considered unbreakable nor the future is carved in stone. In fact, even though it's impossible to stop events from happening, we could at least change the trajectory or the way where it's actually going."  
"预见未来并不容易，即使我也承认那些卷轴可能并不像它们声称的那样绝对。相反，与其他预言一样，它们不能被视为不可打破的，未来也不是刻在石头上的。事实上，尽管无法阻止事件的发生，我们至少可以改变它的轨迹或发展方向。"

"So in other words it's hard to predict?"  
"这么说来，很难预测了？"

Kaworu nodded. "Yes. What occurs tomorrow will depend on what happens today. Cause and effect."  
渚薰点头。"是的。明天会发生什么，取决于今天发生的事情。因果关系。"

"Another good reason why I can no longer trust beauty-magazine horoscopes," Misato muttered. "My birth sign gives me a sucky fortune. In any case, even with your scheme, it'll take some luck to make that happen."  
"又一个我不相信美容杂志星座运势的好理由，"美里嘀咕道。"我的星座运势总是很糟糕。无论如何，即使按照你的计划，要实现它也需要一些运气。"

"You could be right," Kaworu agreed. "But anyway… Do you trust me this time now?"  
"你说得可能对，" 渚薰同意道。"但无论如何…这次你相信我吗？"

At that point Misato was on a quandary; on one hand Kaworu was a potential enemy, and naturally she would question everything he said, as they could be some form of disinformation; on the other, Kaworu clearly reversed his position, his original purpose, and he'd already given her some rather shocking first-hand information, gold-nugget information which Kaji may have withheld or unable to obtain, and which Misato was going after to resolve Kaji's postmortem equivalent of "Fermat's Last Theorem".  
此时美里陷入了两难；一方面，渚薰可能是潜在的敌人，她自然会对他说的一切持怀疑态度，因为这可能是某种形式的假情报；另一方面，渚薰显然已经改变了立场，放弃了初衷，并且他已经向她透露了一些相当震撼的第一手信息，这些信息可能是加持所隐瞒或无法获取的，而美里正追寻这些信息以解决加持死后留下的相当于“费马大定理”的谜团。

Misato finally nodded and said, "I trust you this time. It's a deal."  
美里最终点头说道："这次我相信你。成交。"

"Thanks," Kaworu responded, before she offered her hand for a handshake, Kaworu took hers and with the gesture it was a closed deal. As their hands made contact at the same time, the young man felt the flow of her memories coming into his mind, and through her senses he saw the events that took place in the last few days, ever since the first time they had physical contact.  
"谢谢," 渚回应道，随后她伸出手准备握手，渚握住了她的手，这一举动意味着交易达成。当他们的手接触的瞬间，年轻人感觉到她的记忆涌入自己的脑海，通过她的感官，他看到了过去几天发生的事件，自从他们第一次有身体接触以来。

Once they let go of their hands, without warning Kaworu felt his nose quivering and he sneezed. Instinctively Misato covered her mouth with the back of her hand.  
当他们松开手时，渚突然感到鼻子发痒，打了个喷嚏。出于本能，美里用手背捂住了嘴。

"Bless you," Misato whispered.  
"保佑你，" 美里轻声说道。

"Sorry," Kaworu apologized while repeatedly sniffing. "I think they're probably talking about me by now."  
"对不起，" 渚薰一边反复嗅着一边道歉，"我想他们现在可能正在谈论我。"

**Author's Notes:** This chapter was mad to write! I was close to having a case of a block on this one, making revisions, trying to shuffle around the dialogue, thinking about the words they were about to say and more... and throughout this night and morning this time I'm glad to get my flow back with a shot of coffee and cheap Fortunes (laughs).  
作者笔记：这篇chapter写得真是疯狂！我差点在这篇上遇到写作障碍，不断修改，试图调整对话，思考他们即将说的话等等……经过这一夜和早晨，我很高兴能借助一杯咖啡和廉价的 Fortunes（笑）找回我的写作状态。

Anyway, in this chapter, Misato finally gets her chance from Kaworu, Ritsuko does a retrospect, and the private girl-talk between our heroines (this part amused me as I wrote it, and reminds me of that other little girl-talk between Asuka and Hikari in Episode 18).  
总之，在这篇chapter中，美里终于得到了渚薰的机会，律子进行了回顾，而我们女主角之间的私密女孩谈话（这部分在我写作时让我感到有趣，并让我想起了第 18 集中明日香和光之间的那段小对话）。

Gotta take a bath for now; and perhaps within two days I'll upload this chapter for you readers. Much thanks for your patronage! (grins)  
现在得去洗个澡了；或许两天内我会把这篇《chapter》上传给各位读者。非常感谢你们的支持！（咧嘴笑）

**Addendum:** It has come to my attention that some readers noted a discrepancy I made throughout this story (starting at Chapter 19+=*), such as in the case of Kaworu and Rei designated as physical "vessels" for the souls of Adam and Lilith respectively. To quote Brendan Jamieson and others from the **EvaOtaku** FAQ:  
附录：我注意到一些读者指出我在整个故事中（从《Chapter》第 19 章开始）犯了一个错误，比如将渚薰和绫波丽分别设定为亚当和莉莉丝灵魂的“容器”。引用自 Brendan Jamieson 和 EvaOtaku FAQ 中的其他人的话：

_Kaworu is a cloned body (albino - pale skin/hair, red eyes) with the soul of a Source of Life (Adam); Rei is a cloned body (albino - pale skin/hair, red eyes) with the soul of a Source of Life (Lilith).  
渚薰是一个克隆体（白化病——苍白的皮肤/头发，红眼睛），拥有生命之源（亚当）的灵魂；绫波丽是一个克隆体（白化病——苍白的皮肤/头发，红眼睛），拥有生命之源（莉莉丝）的灵魂。_

And quoting the _Classified Information_ dossiers (from the Eva 2 game, the English translation housed at **EvaGeeks**' Wiki):  
并引用《机密信息档案》（来自《EVA 2》游戏，EvaGeeks 维基上的英文翻译）：

_Lilith had no soul. Moreover,_ its soul has been residing within Rei_. Many copies of Rei's body were made, but that is the reason why only one of Rei herself can exist at any given time. Even though Rei was copied from Yui's flesh, this was not the case for her soul._  
莉莉丝没有灵魂。此外，其灵魂一直寄居在绫波体内。虽然制作了许多绫波的身体副本，但这就是为什么在任何时候只能存在一个真正的绫波。尽管绫波的身体是从唯的肉体复制而来，但她的灵魂并非如此。

Ergo, Kaworu and Rei have _one_ _soul_ and _one body._  
因此，渚薰和绫波共有一个灵魂和一个身体。

However, in my own interpretation (inspired by an extract from Goethe's _Faust_ - _"Two souls, alas, are housed within my breast."_ – see Chapter 1+=*), I thought that because they're "vessels", Kaworu and Rei possessed _two_ souls – _one_ for their _own personalities_, and the _other_ for the dormant Adam and Lilith correspondingly.  
然而，在我个人的解读中（灵感源自歌德的《浮士德》节选——“唉，我的心中，居住着两个灵魂。”——见Chapter 1+=*），我认为因为他们是“容器”，渚薰和绫波拥有两个灵魂——一个代表他们自身的个性，另一个则分别对应沉睡的亚当和莉莉丝。

I would therefore like to apologize to everyone for this personal digression (as well as some other liberties, inventions and simplifications – such is the nature of fanfiction writing), and hope that I have enlightened you all with this addendum. Thank you.  
因此，我想向大家道歉，为这次个人的离题（以及其他一些自由发挥、创造和简化——这就是同人创作的本质），并希望这个附录能为大家带来一些启发。谢谢。

### Chapter 26 Negotiation, Part 2  
Chapter 26 谈判，第二部分

_From his hiding place in the shadows, Sanderson laid there waiting, gripping his suppressed 9mm Walther pistol, locked and loaded. His eyes darted quickly, wary of anyone about to walk into his field of sight, and his ears were alert, prepared for hear even a snippet of noise, shuffling of feet, voices, and breaths, but all he could hear was his heartbeat and the rhythm of his breathing.  
从阴影中的藏身之处，桑德森躺在那里等待，紧握着他那把装有消音器的 9 毫米瓦尔特手枪，子弹已上膛。他的眼睛迅速扫视四周，警惕着任何可能步入他视野的人，耳朵也高度警觉，准备捕捉哪怕一丝细微的声响——脚步的沙沙声、说话声、呼吸声，但除了自己的心跳和呼吸节奏，他什么也没听到。_

_In his mind, he also learned much about her face, and what things she did, and memorized the girl's whole biography. He knew her mother was dead, her father was living with a second wife, and she lived a difficult existence.  
在他的脑海中，他也了解了许多关于她的面容、她的行为，以及她完整的生平。他知道她的母亲已故，父亲与第二任妻子同住，她的生活颇为艰难。_

_Days ago she was supposed to be out of the game, shipped back to where she came from, rendered helpless by the sedatives that put her down. But that was changed, however, as the powers-that-be at NERV first removed the IV drip lines, then gave her a clean bill of health, and just as she was about to leave Tokyo-3, Oda launched an assault against her twice and failed, the killer ultimately paying the price by committing suicide.  
几天前，她本应退出这场游戏，被送回她来的地方，因镇静剂的作用而无力反抗。但情况发生了变化，NERV 的高层先是移除了她的静脉滴注管，随后又给了她一份健康证明，就在她即将离开第三新东京市时，Oda 两次对她发起攻击却均告失败，最终杀手以自杀付出了代价。_

_Now, as his bosses had desperately wanted, Sanderson was here, ready to pounce… and the opportunity he was waiting for was walking towards his position; he could hear the laughter coming from her, whilst her companions were talking. The noise made him ready the gun, knowing where to shoot and he'd been trained to do it at twice or even thrice the speed.  
如今，正如他的上司们所迫切希望的那样，桑德森来到了这里，准备伺机而动……而他等待的时机正朝他的位置走来；他能听到她的笑声，而她的同伴们正在交谈。这些声音让他准备好了枪，知道该往哪里射击，他受过训练，速度可以快到两倍甚至三倍。_

_And he swung around the corner and peered through the sights of his pistol, before he pulled the trigger twice at the incoming Second Section agent, and that man's forehead suddenly had a bloody hole and a stain right over his heart; the other agent, caught unawares, pulled out his gun but was too late, as two more rounds bored into the second man's chest, crimson blossoming over his cotton shirt.  
他转过拐角，透过手枪的瞄准镜窥视，然后对着迎面而来的第二分部特工连开两枪，那人的额头上顿时出现了一个血洞，心脏位置也染上了血迹；另一名特工猝不及防，拔枪却为时已晚，因为又有两发子弹射入了第二人的胸膛，鲜血在他的棉衬衫上绽放。_

_As the men fell, the others scattered, but not for long, as he caught her in his sights before she could take shelter, and he fired thrice; two hollowpoint slugs instantly demolished her heart and lungs, and as the coup-de-grace, the last slug punched through the girl's skull and exited from the back, leaving a gaping baseball-sized maw where her gray matter used to be—  
当这些人倒下时，其他人四散奔逃，但没过多久，他就在她找到掩护之前将她锁定在瞄准镜中，连开三枪；两颗空尖弹瞬间摧毁了她的心脏和肺部，而最后一击，最后一颗子弹穿透了女孩的头颅，从后脑飞出，留下了一个棒球大小的洞口，那里曾经是她的脑组织所在——_

Sanderson blinked twice, and shook his head, realizing he lulled himself into a daydream of his planned assassination of his intended target: Asuka Langley Soryu. Nursing a can of coffee in his hands, he was sitting on a bench in one of the vending machine rooms, about fifty meters away from the Test Facility. He then puffed before he quickly checked his concealed weapons, ready to be pulled out when needed at even a fraction of a second.  
桑德森眨了两次眼，摇了摇头，意识到自己陷入了对计划暗杀目标——惣流·明日香·兰格雷的白日梦中。他双手捧着一罐咖啡，坐在自动售货机室的一张长椅上，距离测试设施约五十米。随后，他深吸一口气，迅速检查了隐藏的武器，准备在需要时甚至在几分之一秒内就能拔出。

Satisfied, he nodded and told himself, _It's all for Instrumentality, as long as I don't screw this up first._  
满意地点了点头，他自言自语道，这一切都是为了人类补完计划，只要我不先搞砸。

But then he heard footsteps from outside, in the hallway, and he watched as Misato and Kaworu walked past him, with no words exchanged between them.  
但随后他听到外面走廊传来的脚步声，看着美里和渚薰从他身边走过，两人之间没有任何言语交流。

_It's him,_ he thought. _What he's doing with that broad? What they're up to?_  
是他，他想。他和那个女人在搞什么？他们到底在做什么？

Sanderson knew that he should keep tabs on the Fifth Children, and already Director Hamamoto earlier briefed him and some agents to conduct a surveillance operation at the Commander's request. He thus now had the license to shadow Kaworu in any way possible, and at the same time satisfy the requirements given by the Chairman.  
桑德森知道他应该密切关注第五适格者，而且早些时候哈马莫托主任已经向他和其他几名特工简要介绍了根据指挥官的要求进行的监视行动。因此，他现在有权以任何可能的方式跟踪薰，同时满足主席的要求。

In this case, it was becoming clear to Sanderson that Kaworu wasn't doing his job.  
在这种情况下，桑德森越来越清楚地意识到，薰并没有尽到他的职责。

"You know, there's an engraving inspired by that line," Kaworu said as he and Misato walked, referring to the words _love conquers all_. "It was made by Agostino Carracci, after I went around the Internet last night, finding anything connected to that quote."  
"你知道吗，有一幅雕刻作品灵感就来自那句话，" 渚薰边走边说，指的是“爱能征服一切”这句话。"那是阿戈斯蒂诺·卡拉奇的作品，昨晚我在网上搜寻与那句名言相关的所有东西时发现的。"

"I haven't seen that before, so what does it looks like?" Misato asked.  
"我之前没见过，那它长什么样？" 美里问道。

Kaworu described the engraving, in which two seemingly frightened young nude women were observing a baby boy striking blows at a much bigger, burly satyr, going down on his knees. He also added that the boy was named Love.  
渚薰描述了那幅雕刻，画面中两位看似惊恐的年轻裸女正注视着一个婴儿男孩对一个体型庞大、粗壮的萨梯猛击，后者跪倒在地。他还补充说，那个男孩名叫爱。

The woman blinked. "That's odd, but why?"  
女人眨了眨眼。"这很奇怪，但为什么呢？"

"The problem is that he's not supposed to be on your flank. You fight with him, try to undo the damage he does to others. Unfortunately, he's too powerful and haughty, and according to Virgil, no matter how much we suffer, our sufferings cannot move him."  
问题在于，他本不该在你的侧翼。你与他战斗，试图消除他对他人造成的伤害。不幸的是，他太过强大且傲慢，据维吉尔所说，无论我们承受多少痛苦，这些痛苦都无法打动他。

Misato looked up briefly, recalling Shinji's personal quagmire. "Sounds like the Man," she said, referring to Commander Ikari as she pointed upward.  
美里短暂地抬头，回想起真嗣的个人困境。“听起来像那位大人，”她指向上方，意指碇司令。

"Right," Kaworu agreed. "In the same sense, Shinji tried everything he could, he went through every crucible, and yet his father doesn't seem to care at all..."  
“对，”渚薰同意道。“同样地，真嗣尝试了他能做的一切，经历了每一个考验，然而他的父亲似乎完全不在乎……”

The woman sighed, and said, "God knows what's going on with that man's mind, but he's beyond caring."  
女人叹了口气，说道：“天知道那个男人的脑子里在想什么，但他已经不在乎了。”

"What kind of father who has little regard for his son?" Kaworu questioned. "And by extension, to all others?"  
"什么样的父亲会如此轻视自己的儿子？" 渚薰质问道。"进而对其他人也是如此？"

"That's what my father used to do," Misato said. "Being selfish, he's bent on achieving a single goal, and sacrificed everything, including relationships, and in the process he wrecked my family. Well, I haven't told you this but before my mom divorced him, and later his death, he was obsessed with the Super Solenoid Theory, where energy could be generated infinitely."  
"这就是我父亲的做法，" 美里说。"自私自利，一心只追求一个目标，牺牲了一切，包括人际关系，最终毁了我的家庭。好吧，我还没告诉你，但在我妈妈和他离婚，后来他去世之前，他痴迷于超螺线理论，认为能量可以无限产生。"

From some tidbits she heard, recalling from memories of her father then restlessly pacing around his small and cluttered office, the man loudly reciting his ideas, Misato outlined the basic principle of the S2 Engine, which created helical energy as a perpetual motion machine, in the same way galaxies and stars are kept alive, by mean of vortices, and without consuming fuel. The problem was that her father's theory was repeatedly criticized by some circles supporting the use of existing and fusion-based energy sources, yet despite denigration he managed to cobble funding into this line of research, and eventually found a mysterious sponsor with more money to support his investigation down at Antarctica.  
从她听到的零星片段，回忆起父亲那时焦躁不安地在狭小杂乱的办公室里踱步，大声阐述他的想法，美里概述了 S2 引擎的基本原理，它通过螺旋能量作为永动机来创造能量，就像星系和恒星通过涡旋得以维持生命一样，无需消耗燃料。问题是，她父亲的理论一再受到支持现有和聚变能源的某些圈子的批评，尽管遭到诋毁，他还是设法筹集资金进行这项研究，并最终找到了一个神秘的赞助者，拥有更多资金支持他在南极的调查。

"…but unfortunately, that was his undoing as he opened Pandora's Box right there," she said.  
“…但不幸的是，这正是他的致命错误，他就在那里打开了潘多拉的盒子，”她说。

"What happened then?" “后来发生了什么？”

Misato shrugged. "When I was finally able to recover myself from the trauma, I demanded answers from the UN, but instead all they gave me was their official bullshit explanation of a meteor impact, even though I was the only survivor then. I pressed further, but dissuaded, accusing me of being a charlatan and loose in the head because of post-traumatic stress syndrome… Goddamn bastards."  
美里耸了耸肩。“当我终于从创伤中恢复过来时，我向联合国要求答案，但他们给我的只是官方的胡扯解释，说什么陨石撞击，尽管当时我是唯一的幸存者。我继续追问，却被劝阻，指责我是个骗子，因为创伤后应激障碍而精神错乱…该死的混蛋。”

"So… You're here now because you wanted to rid of your father's malediction, right?" Kaworu said.  
"所以…你现在来这里是因为你想摆脱你父亲的诅咒，对吧？" 渚薰说道。

Misato nodded. "That's what I'm still doing, and yes, I told people the line that I joined NERV out of revenge, in my belief that Angels were responsible for my father's death."  
美里点头。"我一直在做的就是这个，是的，我告诉人们我加入 NERV 是为了复仇，我相信使徒是导致我父亲死亡的原因。"

"Do you still care about him?"  
"你还关心他吗？"

"I don't know," Misato said as she tweaked the crucifix on her chest, "and I can't say much, but I'm torn up in half whenever I hear that kind of question. So sometimes I asked myself whether I loved or hated him, and it's hard to give a definite answer."  
"我不知道，" 美里一边调整着胸前的十字架，一边说，"我也说不上来，但每次听到这种问题，我都心如刀绞。所以我有时会问自己，我是爱他还是恨他，很难给出一个明确的答案。"

Kaworu sighed. "Letting go might as well be a better solution."  
渚薰叹了口气。"放手或许是个更好的解决办法。"

"I'm doing that," Misato replied. "I want to live the day I look forward instead; I want to be surrounded by people who have in common with my own feelings, I don't want to be a prisoner of the past, of delusions… and I don't want to run away this time."  
"我正在这么做，" 美里回答，"我想过那种期待中的日子；我想和与我心意相通的人在一起，我不想成为过去的囚徒，不想被妄想束缚……这次我不想再逃避了。"

"That's a lot to wish for."  
"那愿望可真多啊。"

"Sure is… But if necessary, I'll go down fighting."  
"确实如此……但如果有必要，我会奋战到底。"

Just ahead of them, and in the control room, Asuka was apologizing to Rei, as the First Children stared back at her opposite number right on the comlink screen.  
在他们前方，控制室里，明日香正向绫波道歉，第一适格者透过通讯屏幕与对方对视。

"No, no, no… Sorry, Rei, don't get mad… I'm just _joking_!" Asuka said, trying to tone down her laughter.  
"不，不，不……对不起，丽，别生气……我只是在开玩笑！" 明日香说着，试图压低她的笑声。

"I do not understand why you think Nagisa is a _dessert_," Rei replied while adjusting her headset.  
"我不明白你为什么认为渚是一种甜点，" 丽回答道，同时调整着她的耳机。

"Okay, okay, I'll make it clear to you: figuratively speaking, he's delicious in some ways, and since you're lucky to have him as company, it should be your pleasure to spend more time with him."  
"好吧，好吧，我会给你说清楚：打个比方，他在某些方面很吸引人，既然你有幸与他为伴，那么花更多时间与他相处应该是你的乐趣。"

"He promised to teach me how to play the violin," Rei said. "In his room I saw that he has a violin of his own."  
"他答应教我拉小提琴，" 丽说。"在他的房间里，我看到他有一把属于自己的小提琴。"

Asuka nodded. "Ah, I don't know that… but that's good for you."  
明日香点点头。"啊，我不清楚……但这对你来说是件好事。"

At the mere mention of that line, Rei suddenly blinked, her mind making a flashback.  
仅仅提到那句话，丽突然眨了眨眼，脑海中闪现出一段回忆。

_Lying on the hospital bed, Shinji looked tired, his eyes almost in a daze after he spent about 18 hours in the Entry Plug, trapped in an Angelic abyss before Unit-01 broke out of the creature's "shadow". He was trying to focus, gazing back at Rei's eyes, before he yawned.  
躺在医院的病床上，真嗣看起来很疲惫，他的眼睛几乎处于恍惚状态，因为在插入栓中度过了大约 18 个小时，被困在天使的深渊中，直到初号机从那生物的“阴影”中挣脱出来。他努力集中注意力，回望着绫波的眼睛，然后打了个哈欠。_

"_You may just rest for today," Rei said, standing above him while holding a booklet. "We will do everything for you."_  
“今天你可以好好休息，”绫波站在他上方说道，手里拿着一本小册子。“我们会为你做所有事情。”

_Shinji repeatedly blinked his eyes till able to keep them wide, and then he groaned. "But I'm just all right now," he said.  
真嗣反复眨眼，直到能够睁大眼睛，然后他呻吟了一声。“但我现在感觉还好，”他说。_

"_Well, that is good for you," Rei answered, made a faint smile before pivoting, and she left the room, leaving Shinji nearly flabbergasted._  
"嗯，那对你来说是好事，" 丽回答道，微微一笑后转身离开，留下真嗣几乎目瞪口呆。

"That was _my_ line," the First Children remarked.  
"那句话是我的台词，" 第一适格者评论道。

"What do you mean?" Asuka questioned.  
"你什么意思？" 明日香问道。

"The one you said 'that is good for you'. I remember that day saying that… When Ikari was at the hospital, after he escaped from the Angel, and I spent the night looking after him."  
“就是你说的‘对你有好处’的那次。我记得那天说过……当碇真嗣在医院时，他从使徒手中逃脱后，我整晚都在照顾他。”

Asuka remembered that one episode, Unit-01 making a Houdini by punching out of the zebra-striped ball after being stuck for almost a day in the pit made by the Angel. "I know that," she said. "Back then that was a crappy day for me, you know."  
明日香记得那次事件，初号机像霍迪尼一样，在被使徒制造的斑马条纹球形坑中困了近一天后，一拳打出重围。“我知道，”她说，“那时候对我来说真是糟糕的一天，你知道的。”

Rei nodded, and she knew the details all too well: at that time she found herself at odds with Asuka, and nearly came close to blows when Misato intervened and kept both girls apart.  
绫波点点头，她对那些细节再清楚不过了：那时她发现自己与明日香意见不合，差点动手，幸亏美里介入，将两人分开。

Asuka sighed. "The past doesn't matter anymore, now that I'm here," she said, preferring not to delve into their past rivalry.  
明日香叹了口气。“既然我现在在这里，过去就不重要了，”她说，不愿深入他们过去的竞争。

---

Meanwhile, sitting on a folding chair provided for him, Shinji drank from a can of cola, while watching Asuka and Rei talking over the comlink. As he nursed his drink, Shinji remembered the faint memory of his mother's fatal contact experiment, where he stood watching from behind the window. He still remembered the words, words that were burned into him for a long time, and now they came back with clarity. Back then, he heard them talking from his behind.  
与此同时，坐在为他准备的折叠椅上，真嗣喝着一罐可乐，同时通过通讯器看着明日香和绫波交谈。他一边慢慢喝着饮料，一边回想起母亲那次致命接触实验的模糊记忆，当时他站在窗后观看。他仍然记得那些话，那些长时间烙印在他心中的话，如今清晰地回响起来。那时，他听到他们从他身后交谈。

"_Why's there a child in here?" Fuyutsuki questioned. Out there, Unit-01 stood, restrained with braces, hoses and cables connected to the purplish man-made leviathan._  
“为什么这里会有个孩子？”冬月质疑道。在外面，初号机被支架、软管和电缆束缚着，连接着那紫色的合成巨兽。

"_This is Chief Ikari's son," one of the scientists present answered, and she looked uncomfortable with the boy's presence. The conversation caught Shinji's attention and he turned around to see them._  
“这是碇司令的儿子，”在场的一位科学家回答道，她似乎对男孩的出现感到不自在。这番对话引起了真嗣的注意，他转过身来望向他们。

_Glancing at the main screen, piping in the video feed from the Entry Plug, Fuyutsuki took the microphone and spoke into it. "Ikari," he said, sounding worried. "This isn't kindergarten, and today's supposed to be a very important day."  
瞥了一眼主屏幕，接入插入栓的视频信号，冬月拿起麦克风说道：“碇，”他的声音透着担忧，“这里不是幼儿园，今天应该是极其重要的一天。”_

_His mother, sitting in a prototype of an Entry Plug, right in the very heart of Unit-01, looked back at Fuyutsuki and said, "Sorry, Doctor Fuyutsuki. It's my fault that I brought him here."  
他的母亲坐在一个插入栓的原型机中，正位于初号机的核心位置，回头看向冬月并说道：“抱歉，冬月博士。是我带他来这里的。”_

"_But... Yui, it's your contact experiment today. We're not supposed to have him around, and this is a risky time to do so."_  
“但是...结衣，今天是你的接触实验。我们本不该让他靠近，这时候这么做很冒险。”

_She shook his head, as if her decision was something little to worry about. "That's why. You said today's important, so I want to show the promising future to my son."  
她摇了摇头，仿佛她的决定不值一提。“正因为如此。你说过今天很重要，所以我想向我的儿子展示一个有希望的未来。”_

Shinji sighed deeply, and wondered why it had to happen that way. It was hard for him to guess what kind of future that his mother was talking about. Was it for his benefit, that his mother left Unit-01 as an inheritance for him to use, or for all mankind, still in dire straits even after fifteen years?  
真嗣深深叹了口气，不明白为何事情会这样发展。他很难猜测母亲所说的未来是什么样的。是为了他，母亲留下初号机作为遗产供他使用，还是为了全人类，即便在十五年后仍处于困境之中？

"May I talk to you?" Fuyutsuki asked him from behind.  
“我可以和你谈谈吗？”冬月从背后问他。

Shinji stood up and whirled around to face the ex-professor, who stood before him and was holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee. "Uh, what is it, sir?"  
真嗣站起身，转过来面对着这位前教授，只见他站在面前，手里拿着一杯泡沫塑料杯装的咖啡。“呃，什么事，先生？”

Fuyutsuki sighed as the man walked closer to Shinji. "Thought it might be the best time for me to explain about your mother," he said, "which perhaps why sometimes you feel unsure with those unanswered questions that are eating you all too long. Seeing you stand before that Eva reminds me of what happened to her years ago."  
冬月叹了口气，走近真嗣。“我想现在是时候向你解释关于你母亲的事了，”他说，“也许这就是为什么你有时会对那些长期未解的问题感到不安。看到你站在那台 EVA 前，让我想起了多年前她发生的事。”

"I have a question… Why Mom said she wanted to show the future to me? What was it? Eva?"  
"我有个问题……为什么妈妈说她想向我展示未来？那是什么？伊娃？"

"Yes, I'm afraid that's right," Fuyutsuki answered. "It was your mother's decision, her risk, because at that time she was deeply embroiled in Project E as much as your father was, unlike today. However, because of her work she ran into trouble with certain people she only knows about, probably stepped on some toes."  
"是的，恐怕是这样，" 冬月回答道。"那是你母亲的决定，她的风险，因为在那时她和你的父亲一样深陷于 E 计划中，不像今天。然而，由于她的工作，她与某些她仅知道的人发生了冲突，可能是不小心触碰了某些人的利益。"

Shinji blinked. "What people?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。"什么人？"

Fuyutsuki gazed up at Unit-02. "Do you know who's actually behind NERV? The men who put it up at the beginning, and provide the funding for our continued operation?"  
冬月抬头凝视着二号机。“你知道 NERV 背后真正的掌控者是谁吗？那些最初建立它的人，以及为我们持续运作提供资金的人？”

"No," Shinji said, shaking his head. "I have no idea."  
“不，”真嗣摇摇头说，“我完全不知道。”

"I'm sure you haven't heard about the Committee, who sometimes asks me, your father or Misato about how you Children and the Evas are doing. Well, they're the _real_ bosses, the overseers who are behind all this, and they're also around even before Second Impact. Going back to your mother, just before she 'died' in Unit One, she found herself in complete disagreement with some of the members of the Committee, as her ideas didn't match up with theirs."  
“我确信你没听说过委员会，他们有时会向我、你父亲或美里询问你们这些孩子们和 EVA 的状况。他们是真正的掌权者，幕后监督这一切的人，甚至在第二次冲击之前就已经存在。回到你母亲，就在她在初号机中‘去世’之前，她发现自己与委员会的一些成员完全意见不合，因为她的想法与他们不一致。”

"Which is…?" “那是……？”

"They argued over the implementation of Project E, and when your mother found out they rejected her views, passed censure on her, and one of them even threatened her life, she came up with a plan to outwit them by requesting to conduct a contact experiment. With Unit One."  
“他们就 E 计划的具体实施产生了争执，当你的母亲发现他们否定了她的观点，对她进行了指责，甚至有人威胁到她的生命时，她想出了一个计划，通过请求进行接触实验来智胜他们。与初号机一起。”

With Shinji listening on, wanting to know more, Fuyutsuki paused to take a sip of his coffee, before resuming.  
在真嗣旁听，渴望了解更多的情况下，冬月停顿了一下，喝了一口咖啡，然后继续说道。

"On that day and I still remember it," he said, "you weren't aware of what's really going on behind the scenes."  
“那天的事，我至今记忆犹新，”他说，“你并不知道幕后真正发生了什么。”

"I could now remember what you were worrying about, though," Shinji said.  
“现在我能记起你在担心什么了，”真嗣说。

"Good, it's coming back to you. As I could recall, we tried to recover whatever's left of your mother, just like what happened to you a few months back; we inserted probes, irradiated the Plug with beams, ran the scanners over and over, and tried everything." Fuyutsuki shook his head. "All we managed to take was the LCL from the plug."  
“很好，你开始回想起来了。我记得，我们试图找回你母亲留下的任何东西，就像几个月前你经历的那样；我们插入了探测器，用光束照射插入栓，一遍遍运行扫描仪，尝试了一切办法。”冬月摇了摇头，“我们唯一能取走的，只有插入栓里的 LCL。”

"I thought she was dead… Father told me her grave is empty; just a tombstone."  
"我以为她已经死了……父亲告诉我她的墓是空的；只有一块墓碑。"

"On the contrary," Fuyutsuki said. "We believe that she, her soul, was _absorbed_ into Unit One."  
"恰恰相反，"" 冬月说。""我们认为她的灵魂，被吸收进了初号机。"

The young boy was stunned. "What?"  
小男孩愣住了。""什么？"

Yet at the same time snippets of memories came back to him. More voices of his mother.  
然而与此同时，零星的记忆片段又回到了他的脑海中。更多母亲的声音。

"_Is it enough? Well, that's good for you."  
“这样够了吗？嗯，对你来说挺好的。”  
"What do you want?" “你想要什么？”_

Next thing he remembered a scene between his mother and father.  
接下来他记得的是母亲和父亲之间的一幕。

"_It's an unfortunate pity that this child will live after Second Impact, in this Hell," Gendo said, looking pessimistic. They were at the levee, under the shade of a towering oak, protected from the glare and heat of the mid-afternoon sun. Beyond them was Lake Ashinoko, its waves glittered in light._  
“很遗憾，这孩子将在第二次冲击后的这个地狱中生存，”碇源堂说，看起来很悲观。他们站在堤坝上，在高大橡树的树荫下，躲避着正午阳光的刺眼和炎热。在他们之外是芦之湖，波浪在阳光下闪烁。

_Yui merely shrugged, as if unperturbed while she nursed Shinji in her arms. "Well, if he wants to live, to survive, anywhere could become Heaven," she said.  
唯只是耸了耸肩，似乎毫不在意，同时她抱着真嗣。“嗯，如果他想活下去，想生存，任何地方都能变成天堂，”她说。_

"_I doubt about it," Gendo replied._  
"我对这一点表示怀疑，"碇源堂回答道。

"_Think again," she said, before sighing. "Because if he really lives, even in this world we live in, he will find a chance to be happy anywhere."_  
"再想想，"她叹了口气后说道，"因为如果他真的活着，即使在我们生活的这个世界里，他也会找到任何机会去获得幸福的。"

_Gendo pondered her words for a moment, and then said, "I see. You may be right."  
碇源堂沉思了一会儿，然后说："我明白了。你可能是对的。"_

And further back into the past.  
再往更远的过去追溯。

"_Have you decided?" Yui asked. She was then pregnant, lying in bed, and Gendo was standing right in front of her. Both of them were in a hospital room._  
“你决定了吗？” 绫问。那时她正怀孕，躺在床上，而源堂就站在她面前。两人身处一间病房。

_Gendo sighed, before he said, "Let's see… I'll name our child Shinji if it's a boy… Rei if it's a girl."  
源堂叹了口气，然后说道：“让我想想……如果是男孩就叫真嗣……如果是女孩就叫丽。”_

_Yui nodded. "Shinji… Rei."_

Fuyutsuki nodded. "She's in the core now," he admitted. "Living on, I believe, in that Eva, almost just in the same way with Asuka's mother, and what happened today is proof that souls can survive."  
冬月点了点头。“她现在在核心里，”他承认道，“我相信，她以那种方式在 Eva 中继续生存，几乎与明日香的母亲一样，而今天发生的事证明了灵魂可以存活。”

"How did you know?"  
"你怎么知道的？"

"The data says so, but I only chose you to tell about it. I know her mother's there in Unit Two because I saw patterns in the data that indicates her presence… and there's the same patterns in the results of that contact experiment."  
“数据是这样显示的，但我只选择告诉你。我知道她母亲在二号机里，因为我从数据中看到了表明她存在的模式……而那次接触实验的结果中也有同样的模式。”

However, Fuyutsuki left out the fact that he and Gendo personally reviewed the after-experiment data as part of the investigation into the incident, and came into the conclusion that Yui's soul was present in the plug. Using whatever genetic and organic material left in the LCL, thinking the primordial soup contained her essence, they attempted to recreate Yui's form and accomplished that, yet were unable to recover her soul. Instead, all they wrought was Rei and she developed a personality of her own, much different from Yui.  
然而，冬月没有提及他和碇源堂亲自审查了实验后的数据，作为对事件调查的一部分，并得出结论认为唯的灵魂存在于插入栓中。利用 LCL 中残留的任何基因和有机物质，认为原始汤中包含了她的本质，他们试图重现唯的形态并成功了，但却无法找回她的灵魂。相反，他们创造出的是绫波，她发展出了自己的个性，与唯截然不同。

But Rei possessed certain traits that Fuyutsuki reminded him much of Yui, such as her motherliness and the protective instinct that came with it.  
但丽拥有某些特质，让副司令想起了唯，比如她的母性和随之而来的保护欲。

"In your case, it means that your mother's not far from you," Fuyutsuki added. "Or, for that matter, she's closer than you think. Indeed, she's right among us."  
“对你来说，这意味着你母亲离你不远，”副司令补充道，“或者说，她比你想象的更近。实际上，她就在我们中间。”

Shinji needed not to ask any further, as he glanced at Rei sitting right before the communication console, still deep in conversation with Asuka. Fuyutsuki was correct, Rei was living proof that a part of his mother's personality persisted long after her physical presence disappeared from existence.  
真嗣无需再问更多，因为他瞥见了坐在通讯控制台前的丽，仍在与明日香深入交谈。副司令说得没错，丽的存在证明了母亲性格的一部分在她肉体消失后依然长久留存。

Fuyutsuki then turned to Maya, who was still working at another workstation, and asked, "How she's holding up?"  
冬月随后转向真希波，她仍在另一工作站忙碌，问道：“她情况如何？”

"Let's see, sir…" Maya said, checking the terminals before her, and shot a glance at the main display. "Sync and harmonics are still within acceptable levels. No major changes so far."  
“让我看看，先生……”真希波说着，检查着面前的终端，并瞥了一眼主显示屏，“同步率和谐波仍在可接受范围内。目前没有重大变化。”

"Good," Fuyutsuki agreed. "Anything else?"  
“很好，”冬月赞同道，“还有其他情况吗？”

"Barring a single surge spike at the beginning," she said, "everything's normal, just like before she lost almost everything. By the figures, I'd say she can even be combat-ready, sir."  
"除了起初的一个小峰值，"她说，"一切都很正常，就像她失去几乎所有东西之前一样。从数据来看，我甚至可以说她可以随时投入战斗，长官。"

The old man merely smiled and, turning to face the crew, he said aloud, "By the way, since this test is clearly a major success for us all, I suppose everyone's lunch is on _me_."  
老人只是微微一笑，转向全体船员，大声说道："顺便说一句，既然这次测试对我们所有人来说显然是一个巨大的成功，我想大家的午餐就由我来请客吧。"

Everyone, including Maya, blinked in reaction to Fuyutsuki's offer of a free lunch, whispering as they relayed the declaration. Even Rei and Asuka paused, latching into the old man's announcement.  
包括摩耶在内的所有人都对冬月请客午餐的提议感到惊讶，低声传递着这个消息。就连丽和明日香也停了下来，关注着老人的宣布。

"No, this is no joking matter, people," he said wryly, as Shinji looked on. "I _really_ mean it; whether you're present here or the crew down at the test floor, I'll reimburse your lunch expenses as long I'm sitting and eating with the rest of you right there at the Cafeteria, and Miss Langley deserves her reward."  
"不，这不是开玩笑的事，各位，" 他苦笑着说，一旁的真嗣看着他。"我是认真的；无论你们是在这里还是在测试楼层，只要我和大家一起坐在食堂里吃饭，你们的午餐费用我都会报销，而兰格利小姐也理应得到她的奖励。"

Suddenly the control room erupted in applause. Free lunch! From the Sub-Commander, no less!  
突然间，控制室里爆发出热烈的掌声。免费午餐！还是副司令请的！

---

Just as they walked into the control room, Misato and Kaworu were stunned by the unexpected uproar of cheers.  
他们刚走进控制室，美里和薰就被这突如其来的欢呼声惊呆了。

"What the hell's going on?" Misato asked, blinking.  
“到底发生了什么？”美里眨着眼睛问道。

"I have no idea," Kaworu answered.  
“我也不知道，”渚回答道。

But the woman, by eavesdropping into the conversation between the techs, now had an answer: the Sub-Commander was willing to pay for their lunch at his own expense. Misato then chuckled amusedly. "Well, sounds like the Sub-Commander must be really on a roll this time," she remarked.  
但通过偷听技术人员之间的对话，这位女士现在有了答案：副司令愿意自掏腰包请他们吃午饭。美里随即愉快地笑了起来。“看来这次副司令真是顺风顺水啊，”她评论道。

"He should be," Kaworu added. "After all, it's Asuka's comeback."  
"他应该会来，"渚薰补充道，"毕竟，这是明日香的回归。"

At the same time Shinji rose up from his seat, and Rei was walking towards them. "How did it go?" Shinji asked Misato as the First Children stood besides him.  
与此同时，真嗣从座位上站起身，而绫波零正向他们走来。"情况如何？"真嗣问美里，同时第一适格者站在他身旁。

"It's okay, we talked and then agreed on something," Misato answered.  
"没事，我们谈了谈，然后达成了共识，"美里回答道。"

Shinji scratched his head. "What is it?"  
真嗣挠了挠头。“怎么了？”

Misato shook her head. "Can't tell you. But anyway, is Asuka doing okay?"  
美里摇了摇头。“不能告诉你。不过，总之，明日香还好吗？”

"No problem," Shinji said.  
“没问题，”真嗣说。

"She was happy even while talking to me," Rei added.  
"她和我说话时也很开心，"丽补充道。

"What did you two talked about?" Kaworu asked.  
"你们俩聊了些什么？"渚薰问道。

"I cannot say," the red-eyed girl answered. "It is too personal. Only between us."  
"我不能说，"红眼女孩回答。"这太私人了。只有我们之间。"

"Ah, I see," Kaworu said, nodding.  
"啊，我明白了，" 渚薰点头说道。

Shinji suddenly chuckled. "Never thought you'll be into girl talk, Ayanami," he remarked.  
真嗣突然轻笑起来。"没想到你也会对女孩的话题感兴趣，绫波，" 他评论道。

"It is not a problem," Rei said. "I have discovered that there is good conversation, no matter how small or trivial."  
"这没什么，" 绫波说。"我发现无论话题多么微不足道，都有值得交流的地方。

"Say, what else we should be doing after this and lunch?" Misato asked them all. "There seems to be nothing scheduled this afternoon."  
"说起来，午饭后我们还有什么安排吗？" 美里向大家问道，"今天下午好像没有预定活动。"

"I would like to spend time with Kaworu," Rei said, with Kaworu nodding in agreement.  
"我想和薰一起度过时间，" 绫波说，薰也点头表示同意。"

"Tea time again?" Misato inquired, before she grinned. "…Or something _more_ than that?" the woman added.  
"又是茶会吗？" 美里询问道，随后露出了笑容。"……还是说，有更进一步的计划？" 她补充道。"

The question caught Rei unawares; she quickly blushed and Kaworu blinked.  
这个问题让丽措手不及；她迅速脸红，而渚则眨了眨眼。

"No," Rei objected, shaking her head. "_Not_ that sort of thing."  
“不，”丽反驳道，摇着头。“不是那种事。”

Shinji – wide-eyed and with a sweatdrop on his forehead – wondered what got into Misato's brain to ask such a question. Maybe she was probably trying to have a bit of Kaji's playful attitude and jesting, just like when they first met Asuka on the aircraft carrier. Heck, if Kaji were to be alive today, and somehow knew that Rei and Kaworu were going steady, surely he would tease the girl to death by asking about her _sex life_. He thus imagined this exchange between them:  
真嗣——瞪大眼睛，额头上挂着一滴汗——想知道美里脑子里到底在想什么，会问出这样的问题。也许她是在尝试模仿加持那种轻松幽默的态度，就像他们第一次在航空母舰上遇到明日香时那样。见鬼，如果加持今天还活着，并且不知怎么知道了丽和渚正在交往，他肯定会通过询问她的性生活来把女孩逗得死去活来。于是他想象着他们之间的这段对话：

"_Are you dating Nagisa?" Kaji asked._  
"你在和渚约会吗？" 加持问道。

_Rei merely nodded. "Yes."_

_Kaji grinned and questioned bluntly, "Tell me, have you lost your virginity?"  
加持咧嘴一笑，直截了当地问："告诉我，你失去童贞了吗？"_

"Okay, sorry, I'll not bother you," Misato said apologetically, but in a humorous tone. "I'll have it your way, whether it's tea or something."  
"好吧，抱歉，我不会再打扰你了，" 美里带着歉意但幽默的语气说，"我会按你的方式来，不管是茶还是别的什么。"

"Thank you," Rei said, managing to heave a relieved sigh.  
"谢谢你," 丽说道，终于松了一口气，发出一声释然的叹息。

Misato now turned her attention to the Sub-Commander's workstation and saw the old man stand up, before he glanced at the timer on the main display: two minutes left.  
美里现在将注意力转向副指挥官的工作站，看到那位老人站起身来，随后瞥了一眼主显示屏上的计时器：还剩两分钟。

---

The control room was now hushed into near silence, as the techs were hunched over their terminals. Fuyutsuki nodded to Makoto to begin powering down Unit-02.  
控制室此刻几乎陷入了寂静，技术人员们都俯身在自己的终端前。冬月向真希波点头示意，开始关闭 02 号机。

"Initiate shutdown sequence," Makoto announced, as he glanced at the displays before him, with all systems in the green.  
"启动关机程序，" 真琴宣布道，目光扫过眼前所有系统显示为绿色的屏幕。

"Preparing to disconnect the power," Shigeru said, typing out the termination commands on his workstation, before he had his fingers on the main power switches.  
"准备断开电源，" 茂说，在操作台上输入终止命令，手指随后放在主电源开关上。

"Okay, go switch to power-down," Makoto replied.  
"好的，开始切换到关机状态，" 真琴回应道。

Shigeru flipped the first switch, and they could hear the power slowly beginning to fade out, as the current and voltage meters plummeted until zero. Inside Unit-02, Asuka could see the walls of her Entry Plug dim and then the whole interior plunged into darkness, before the auxiliary lights came on. She gave out a contented sigh of satisfaction, now that issues between her and Unit-02 were finally settled; they were a team once again.  
碇司令拨动了第一个开关，他们能听到电源逐渐开始减弱，电流和电压表急速下降直至归零。在二号机内部，明日香可以看到驾驶舱的墙壁逐渐暗淡，随后整个内部陷入黑暗，直到辅助灯光亮起。她发出了一声满意的叹息，现在她与二号机之间的问题终于解决了；他们再次成为了一个团队。

"All power's down," Shigeru announced, nodding.  
“所有电源已关闭，”碇司令宣布，点头示意。

"Now disengage the Umbilical Cord," Makoto commanded.  
“现在断开脐带电缆，”真希波命令道。

"Roger that," the long-haired tech replied as he flipped the second switch to unplug the Umbilical Cord, actuators contracting as the oversized electrical plug came off the Eva's back before being pulled off by a robot arm.  
"收到，"长发技术员回应道，随即翻开第二个开关，断开脐带电缆。随着巨大的电源插头从 Eva 背部脱离，机械臂收缩将其拉走。

"Disconnection confirmed," Maya said. "Entry Plug is ready to be released."  
"断开确认，" Maya 报告道。"插入栓准备释放。"

"Go release," Makoto answered, and the petite tech pressed a large button on her console. The video feed on the back of the Eva showed the protective carapace retracting, before the Entry Plug was pulled out by an outsized extractor, gripping the Plug's circumference. The extractor then swiveled to the insertion deck, and another actuated arm went down to pull back the cover over Asuka's cockpit.  
"释放吧，" Makoto 回答，娇小的技术员按下控制台上的大按钮。Eva 背部的视频显示保护甲壳回缩，随后巨大的提取器抓住插入栓的周长将其拉出。提取器随后转向插入甲板，另一只机械臂下降，拉开覆盖在 Asuka 驾驶舱上的盖子。

"Release and recovery complete," Maya said. "Now locking down Unit Two," she added, as the extractor inserted a terminal plug into the Eva, and then they could hear a loud metallic snap once the binder locks were in place.  
“释放与恢复完成，”玛雅说道，“现在锁定二号机，”她补充道，随着提取器将终端插头插入 EVA，随后他们听到一声响亮的金属咔嗒声，绑定锁已固定到位。

Fuyutsuki sighed, feeling contented. "Okay, now what do we have in the last thirty minutes? VR on the main display, please," he ordered. VR meant a visual representation of the data.  
冬月叹了口气，感到心满意足。“好了，过去三十分钟我们有什么数据？请在主显示屏上显示 VR，”他命令道。VR 即数据的可视化表示。

"Yes, sir," Maya said as she typed some commands to gather and sum up the overall performance data, before displaying it right onscreen. The graphs showed everything at normal levels, especially her harmonics, just like back when Asuka was at her peak.  
“是，长官，”玛雅回答，她输入了一些命令来收集并汇总整体性能数据，然后直接在屏幕上显示出来。图表显示一切都在正常水平，特别是她的谐波，就像明日香在巅峰时期一样。

"Overall sync performance is 44%, sir," Maya reported, and she sighed in pleasure. "Guess this one's will be for the books."  
“总体同步表现是 44%，长官，”玛雅报告道，她满意地叹了口气。“看来这次的数据会载入史册了。”

"Very good," Fuyutsuki praised, and then he turned his gaze towards Misato and the Children. "You better come and meet Miss Langley down there," he said.  
“非常好，”冬月赞许道，随后将目光转向美里和孩子们。“你们最好下来见见兰格利小姐，”他说。

Misato nodded. "Thanks sir," she replied, before turning to her charges. "C'mon, let's go," she persuaded them, leading the way out of the control room and down to the plug insertion deck via elevator. But once the elevator doors closed on them, Ritsuko Akagi passed by, on her way to the control room.  
美里点头。“谢谢长官，”她回答，然后转向她的孩子们。“来吧，我们走，”她催促着，带领他们离开控制室，通过电梯下到插入栓甲板。但当电梯门在他们身后关闭时，赤木律子正好经过，前往控制室。

---

At his workstation, Fuyutsuki was listening to his subordinates' comments and oral reports when Ritsuko walked in with a plastic bag containing Oda's laptop.  
在工位上，冬月正听着下属们的评论和口头报告，这时律子带着一个装有 Oda 笔记本电脑的塑料袋走了进来。

"Oh," the old man said as he stood up and smiled. "So you're here."  
“哦，”老人站起身来微笑道，“你来了。”

Ritsuko nodded, as the techs walked back to their stations in quiet deference for their superiors' need for a one-on-one discussion. "That's right, and I'm sorry if I'm late, yet I want to congratulate Asuka, sir," she said, before she glanced up at the main display. "She has done well… 43 percent," the woman remarked in praise. "I never thought she could make a real turn-around… But where's Misato?"  
律子点头，技术人员们安静地回到自己的岗位，以示对上级一对一讨论的尊重。“是的，如果我迟到了，我很抱歉，但我还是要祝贺明日香，先生，”她说着，抬头看向主显示屏，“她做得很好……43%，”她称赞道，“我从没想过她能真正扭转局面……但美里在哪里？”

"She and the Children went down to meet Asuka."  
"她和孩子们下楼去迎接明日香。"

Ritsuko nodded. "I see. I'll wait instead."

"What about the laptop?" Fuyutsuki asked, referring to the killer's computer.  
"那台笔记本电脑呢？" 冬月问道，指的是凶手的电脑。"

"All of his data has been transferred to Hamamoto," Ritsuko informed, lifting the bag for him to see before she sat down on an empty chair. "I also made copies should we need to analyze them on our own."  
"他的所有数据都已转移到浜本那里，" 律子说着，举起袋子让他看了一眼，然后坐在一张空椅子上。"我还做了备份，以防我们需要自行分析。"

"Good," he said. "What else you have found?"  
“好，”他说，“你还发现了什么？”

Ritsuko placed the bag on her lap. "Well, yes, there is. Thought you might find it very interesting: by his inbound IP addresses this guy has contacts anywhere from Russia, China, Europe, and America… I think he's part of a network, because he seems to be keeping a form of shorthand for some of his correspondence, and it's up to Section Two to guess his codes. Of course, some of his communications are encrypted, his contacts are using email addresses under different names, and he also sanitizes his internet browser and IM, while hiding behind a Garlic Router network to lose anyone trying to trace his whereabouts."  
律子将袋子放在膝上。“嗯，确实有。我想你可能会觉得这非常有趣：根据他的入站 IP 地址，这家伙的联系遍布俄罗斯、中国、欧洲和美国……我怀疑他是一个网络的一部分，因为他似乎在某些通信中使用了一种速记形式，而破解这些代码的任务落在了第二科头上。当然，他的一些通信是加密的，他的联系人使用不同名字的电子邮件地址，他还清理了自己的互联网浏览器和即时通讯软件，同时通过一个大蒜路由器网络隐藏自己，以摆脱任何试图追踪他位置的人。”

The Garlic Network, created and operated by a non-profit group, was one way to allow political dissidents, whistle-blowers and, of course, spies, to keep their internet access secure from prying governments.  
大蒜网络，由一个非营利组织创建和运营，是一种允许政治异见者、举报人，当然还有间谍，从窥探的政府手中保持互联网访问安全的方式。

Fuyutsuki then pondered for a while and then he said, "You know, there's another way to get as much information as possible, like you try to act as Oda behind that laptop."  
冬月随后沉思片刻，然后说道：“你知道，还有另一种方法可以尽可能多地获取信息，比如你尝试在笔记本电脑后面扮演织田的角色。”

Ritsuko shook her head. "Masquerading may sound like a good idea, but I think by now he has been compromised and so his handlers may have ditched him to ensure no one could try to trace back to them. I'm sorry, sir."  
律子摇了摇头。“伪装听起来可能是个好主意，但我认为他现在可能已经暴露了，所以他的处理者可能会抛弃他，以确保没有人能试图追溯到他们。很抱歉，先生。”

"I see… Finally," Fuyutsuki said. "Are you ready to talk to Misato?"  
“我明白了……终于，”冬月说。“你准备好和美里谈谈了吗？”

The woman scientist sighed. "I want to make up for the mistakes between us," she said. "I also like to settle some issues… and I'd like to apologize to her."  
女科学家叹了口气。“我想弥补我们之间的错误，”她说。“我也喜欢解决一些问题……我想向她道歉。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "It's perfectly understandable," he agreed. "Moreover, I find it a critical necessity that you two women must set aside your animosities as we're at a very difficult time."  
冬月点了点头。“这完全可以理解，”他同意道。“此外，我认为你们两位女士必须放下敌意，因为我们正处于非常困难的时期。”

"I understand," Ritsuko said.  
“我明白，”律子说。

The old man stared at her and said, "Frankly, I don't want to see you people fall apart; I don't want to watch the Children become divided and demoralized, and I want to keep this organization united and afloat even as we do have a crisis in leadership."  
老人盯着她，说道：“坦白说，我不想看到你们这些人分崩离析；我不想目睹孩子们变得四分五裂、士气低落，我希望在我们面临领导危机时，这个组织仍能团结一致、屹立不倒。”

"Speaking of leadership," Ritsuko spoke. "Where's he?" she questioned, referring to Gendo.  
“说到领导，”律子开口道，“他在哪儿？”她指的是源堂。

"You mean Ikari?"

Ritsuko nodded. "Yes."

Fuyutsuki sighed. "He's still up there, at his office. Just before I left him he told me he'll watch the test from there… Well, why?"  
冬月叹了口气，“他还在上面，在他的办公室里。就在我离开他之前，他告诉我他会在那里观看测试……怎么了？”

"Funny, you're in charge now more than he is," Ritsuko remarked. "Dunno, but because of your seniority and, judging from how much work you're doing, you should've been in his position in the first place."  
"奇怪，你现在负责的事情比他还多，" 律子评论道。"不知道，但鉴于你的资历和目前所做的工作量，你本应一开始就处于他的位置。"

"I should have," Fuyutsuki said, "but because Project E is his brainchild, he's supposed to be responsible for everything, and I was intended to serve as his advisor. However, I'm like Gandalf trying to deal with Denethor."  
"我本该如此，" 冬月说，"但因为 E 计划是他的构想，他理应负责一切，而我原本打算担任他的顾问。然而，我现在就像甘道夫试图对付迪耐瑟一样。"

Ritsuko blinked. "Come again? What are you talking about?"  
律子眨了眨眼。"再说一遍？你在说什么？"

"Sorry," Fuyutsuki said wryly. "They're from the _Lord of the Rings._ Now, to clear things for you, as a steward Denethor was supposed to be wholly responsible for the city he should be defending against Sauron, and naturally Gandalf must persuade that man to take action. The problem is that Denethor has gone mad and feared inevitable defeat in the hands of their enemies, so he planned to take his ill son with him by immolation. Thus Gandalf had to stop him from doing that suicidal stunt… and I'm afraid I'm in the same position as that wizard."  
"对不起，" 冬月苦笑着说，"他们来自《指环王》。现在，为了给你解释清楚，作为城主，迪耐瑟本应全权负责这座城市，抵御索伦的进攻，而甘道夫自然得说服他采取行动。问题是迪耐瑟已经疯了，害怕在敌人手中不可避免的失败，所以他计划带着他生病的儿子一起自焚。因此甘道夫必须阻止他这种自杀式的行为……恐怕我现在和那位巫师处境相同。"

"So… In that sense, you mean you're trying to take charge?" Ritsuko inquired, this time in a low voice.  
"这么说……你的意思是，你打算接管一切？" 律子低声问道。

"Considering Ikari is becoming fickle by the minute, I may have to step in, should things come to worse," Fuyutsuki said. "If the Committee decides to take unfavorable action towards us, there's no choice except to defend ourselves, as they're not pleased at where we're going towards right now."  
"考虑到碇已经越来越反复无常，如果情况恶化，我可能不得不介入，" 冬月说，"如果委员会决定对我们采取不利的行动，除了自卫，我们别无选择，因为他们对我们目前的走向并不满意。"

Ritsuko looked alarmed. "But, does it mean they could also use _violent_ action?"  
"律子看起来很惊慌。“但是，这是否意味着他们也可能采取暴力行动？””

"Given their vast resources, that's no longer a remote possibility, which is why I approved the acquisition of new weaponry for our security forces because I fear they will do anything to get what they want."  
“考虑到他们庞大的资源，这不再是一个遥远的可能性，这就是为什么我批准了为我们的安全部队购置新武器，因为我担心他们会不择手段地得到他们想要的东西。”

At the plug insertion deck, whilst his men went about inspecting the Entry Plug, Kasuga the crew chief tossed a towel to Asuka, who caught and then used it to dry her LCL-soaked hair. Once done, she then stood up and threw the towel back to the man. "Thanks," she said.  
在插入栓甲板上，当他的手下正在检查插入栓时，总管加须川将一条毛巾扔给了明日香，她接住并用它擦干了被 LCL 浸湿的头发。完成后，她站起身将毛巾扔回给加须川。“谢谢，”她说。

Kasuga nodded. "My pleasure, miss, and congratulations… And oh, here they come," he said as Misato and the other Children walked out of the service elevator. In varying degrees they looked glad.  
Kasuga 点了点头。“这是我的荣幸，小姐，恭喜你……哦，他们来了，”他说着，Misato 和其他孩子们从服务电梯里走了出来。他们各自带着不同程度的喜悦。

"Hey, congratulations to you!" Misato said aloud as Shinji rushed towards Asuka, who was getting off the cockpit, and they hugged and kissed.  
“嘿，也恭喜你们！”Misato 大声说道，只见 Shinji 冲向刚从驾驶舱下来的 Asuka，两人拥抱并亲吻。

Kaworu and Rei likewise smiled and looked at each other, and then without warning Asuka gave Rei the firmest hug possible. "I owe you a million, you know," the redhead said.  
Kaworu 和 Rei 也相视而笑，随后 Asuka 突然给了 Rei 一个最坚定的拥抱。“我欠你一百万，你知道的，”红发女孩说道。

"I understand," Rei answered, almost in a muffled tone as she was squeezed, before Asuka let go of her.  
"我明白，" 丽回答道，声音几乎被挤压得有些沉闷，随后明日香放开了她。

The Second Children sighed and grinned. "I wish that sometimes soon you should've been fighting alongside me, had it not for losing Unit Zero."  
第二适格者叹了口气，咧嘴一笑。"我希望不久的将来，如果不是因为零号机丢失，你本可以和我并肩作战的。"

"My duty with Unit Zero is done," Rei said. "It is more acceptable for me to watch you in action instead."  
"我对零号机的职责已经完成，" 丽说。"现在更适合我看着你行动。"

"Oh, well," Asuka shrugged. "It's your choice, Rei. I'll respect that."  
"哦，好吧，" 明日香耸了耸肩。"这是你的选择，丽。我会尊重的。"

"Thank you," Rei said before she took hold of Kaworu's hand. Asuka then turned her attention to Kaworu.  
"谢谢你，" 丽说道，随即握住了渚薰的手。明日香接着将注意力转向了渚薰。

"As for you," the redhead said, "If it weren't for you and your advice, all of my efforts would've come to nothing. I thank you again for asking me to give myself another chance, Kaworu."  
"至于你，" 红发的女孩说道，"如果不是因为你和你的建议，我所有的努力都将化为泡影。再次感谢你让我给自己一个机会，渚薰。"

Kaworu nodded. "It's still my pleasure helping you out," he replied.  
渚薰点头道：“能帮到你，我依然感到很高兴。”

Somewhere in Siberia, deep within the secret military base, and inside a hangar of unimaginably huge proportions, Keel Lorenz and the other Committee members glanced up at Eva Unit-05, who had "horse blinders" in lieu of eyes and its disturbing grin was permanently plastered on its elongated cetacean face. Designated as Mass Production Eva models, this white-painted monster and eight others of its brethren had their outsized wings folded, and they were held down onto each of their own restraining binder frames. Throughout this immense hangar, teams of technicians serviced these Evas, blissfully unaware of their true purpose as they went on their maintenance duties.  
在西伯利亚深处，一个秘密军事基地内，一座规模大得难以想象的机库中，基尔·洛伦兹和其他委员会成员抬头望向 EVA 五号机，它的眼睛被替换成了“马眼罩”，那令人不安的笑容永远固定在它那拉长的鲸鱼脸上。这些被指定为量产型 EVA 的白色怪物，连同它的八个同类，巨大的翅膀折叠着，被各自固定在约束框架上。在这庞大的机库中，技术人员团队正对这些 EVA 进行维护，全然不知它们的真正用途，只是继续执行着他们的保养任务。

"Gentlemen," Keel said, pointing at Unit-05, "this is money well-spent. Eight billion American dollars apiece, decades' worth of research, yet good for a single day's use. However, let us be aware that in Instrumentality, money will be rendered irrelevant, to exist only as a memory among many material possessions."  
“先生们，”基尔指着五号机说道，“这是物有所值的投资。每台八亿美元，数十年的研究，却仅能使用一天。然而，让我们明白，在人类补完计划中，金钱将变得无关紧要，只会作为众多物质记忆中的一部分存在。”

The other somber old men nodded and whispered their agreements. For the first time in the history of their sect, they have come together as men rather than holographic monoliths, and earlier as they congregated at their designated meeting place they remarked about their appearances and well-being. Despite all of them being wealthy and powerful, a quarter of them were diagnosed with a terminal disease, more than half were widowers, and only a handful had to walk with their crutches or survive on cybernetic implants.  
其他神情肃穆的老者点头低语，表示赞同。这是他们宗派历史上首次以人的身份而非全息巨石的形式聚集。早些时候，当他们在指定地点集合时，他们还互相评论着彼此的外表和健康状况。尽管他们都富有且有权势，但其中四分之一的人被诊断出患有绝症，超过半数是鳏夫，只有少数人需要依靠拐杖行走或依赖于电子植入物生存。

With Keel's remark, however, they knew damn well that only Instrumentality was the cure to all of their mortal and corporeal ills, as no amount of wealth, the potency of medicine, or religious beliefs would resolve the dilemma of death; they want to succeed where pharaohs, emperors, kings and other demigods of old have failed: to obtain eternal life through apotheosis at any cost.  
然而，基尔的这番话让他们深知，唯有工具化才是解决他们所有凡俗病痛的良方，因为无论财富多寡、药物效力如何，或是宗教信仰，都无法解决死亡这一难题；他们渴望在法老、皇帝、国王以及其他古老半神失败的地方取得成功：不惜一切代价通过神化获得永生。

"All nine of these Evas," Keel began to speak before the rest of the Committee, "are at the pinnacle of perfection. First, they have working S2 Engines, which of course will allow them to outlast their opponents, regenerate more quickly if injured, and provide immense amount of energy to generate an AT Field more powerful than what Ikari has with his Evas.  
"“这九台 Eva，”基尔开始在委员会其余成员面前发言，“都达到了完美的顶峰。首先，它们配备了 S2 引擎，当然这将使它们能够比对手更持久，受伤后更快再生，并提供巨大的能量来生成比碇的 Eva 更强大的 AT 力场。”

"Second, they have flight capacity with wings and AT Field levitation, which will give them another edge in combat, as Ikari's Evas are stuck on the ground like sitting ducks. Any attempts at shooting them down with conventional weapons will be futile.  
"“其次，它们具备翅膀和 AT 力场悬浮的飞行能力，这将使它们在战斗中占据另一优势，因为碇的 Eva 就像待宰的鸭子一样被困在地面上。任何试图用常规武器击落它们的尝试都将徒劳无功。”

"Finally, and the best part, gentlemen… they all have Dummy Plugs, and with Nagisa's thought patterns. Repeated testing of their systems through combat simulations resulted in a near-perfect victory over our opponents. Furthermore, these Plugs also have the advantage of self-learning, meaning to say that they will learn the tricks and tactics of their enemies as they go, and use them to their advantage. If Ikari sends his Children to confront and make battle with our Evas, then it would be a suicidal gesture on their part."  
“最后，也是最精彩的部分，先生们……它们都配备了 Dummy Plugs，并采用了渚薰的思维模式。通过战斗模拟对它们的系统进行反复测试，结果几乎完美地战胜了我们的对手。此外，这些 Plug 还具有自我学习优势，也就是说，它们将在战斗中学习敌人的技巧和战术，并加以利用。如果碇派出他的孩子们来对抗我们的 Eva，那么对他们来说将是自杀行为。”

The Committee members were all pleased, and thus they gave Keel their applause. However, Keel gestured with an upraised finger, and said, "In case you're wondering about what weapon these Evas will be carrying, ours have a surprise hidden in them."  
委员会成员们皆感满意，于是纷纷向基尔报以掌声。然而，基尔竖起一根手指示意，并说道：“若你们好奇这些 EVA 将配备何种武器，我们的可是藏有惊喜。”

Silenced, the men present listened closely except for one, pale as Death with the white hair and a gaunt face, who then asked, "And what is it?"  
沉默中，在场的人除了一个脸色苍白如死、白发瘦削的人外，都仔细聆听，随后那人问道：“那是什么？”

Keel grinned. "We have successfully replicated the properties of the original Spear of Longinus," he disclosed, "and they're disguised as swords. If deployed in Spear form they will cut through an AT Field with little effort."  
基尔咧嘴一笑。“我们已经成功复制了朗基努斯之矛的特性，”他透露道，“它们被伪装成剑。如果以矛的形式使用，它们将轻松穿透 AT 力场。”

Gasps of astonishment came from the other old men. Their collective reaction pleased Keel and he added, "There's nothing for us to lose. The advantage is indisputably ours. Whatever he does, we will make Ikari pay for his betrayal, as we watch his Rome burn to the ground... _By hook or by crook, we will_."  
"其他老者发出惊愕的喘息声。他们的集体反应让基尔感到满意，他补充道：“我们没有什么可失去的。优势无可争议地在我们这边。无论他做什么，我们都会让碇为他的背叛付出代价，看着他的罗马化为灰烬……无论如何，我们都会做到。””

Amidst the chatter of relaxing personnel, either sitting at their stations or gathering with their fellows or talking to Fuyutsuki, for the first time in years, or it seemed to her, Ritsuko felt nervous about meeting Misato once more; she wasn't really sure how she could say the first words since they walked away from the Dummy Plug Plant without a word between the two women. As she sat on the chair provided for her, she remembered that moment of total shame, of walking in tears, trying to wipe them away from her cheeks, as she pondered the consequences of her actions.  
在放松的人员们的闲聊声中，有人坐在自己的岗位上，有人与同伴聚集，还有人正与冬月交谈，对于多年未见，或者说在她看来如此的律子来说，再次见到美里让她感到紧张；她不确定该如何说出自她们离开模拟插入栓工厂后两人间的第一句话。当她坐在为她准备的椅子上时，她回忆起那一刻的彻底羞愧，泪流满面地试图擦去脸颊上的泪水，同时思考着自己行为的后果。

Fortunately they were only three of them at that time, and once Misato pulled her up from the floor, the woman promised that none of what happened down there would ever be told, except later Gendo somehow knew what was going on, and in his cold and silent fury ordered her arrest.  
幸运的是，当时只有她们三个人在场，而且美里从地板上拉起她后，这位女士承诺，那里发生的一切永远不会被透露，只是后来源堂不知怎么知道了情况，在他冷酷无声的愤怒中下令逮捕了她。

Ritsuko sighed, as she willed her mind to bring back the past, when she had a measure of independence from her mother's shadow…  
律子叹了口气，努力让自己的思绪回到过去，那时她还能在母亲的阴影下保持些许独立……

Back then, she and Misato were once different women and of different upbringing, who became friends in college, and out of mutual friendship they stayed for a while in the dorm together. Despite that they tried to put up with each other's personal quirks, they managed to go through those four years before going on their separate ways: Misato volunteering for training at NERV Germany, and Ritsuko for post-graduate studies.  
那时，她和美里曾是两个背景迥异的女性，在大学里成为朋友，出于共同的友谊，她们在宿舍里同住了一段时间。尽管她们试图忍受彼此的个人怪癖，但还是在四年后分道扬镳：美里志愿前往 NERV 德国接受训练，而律子则继续攻读研究生。

In those care-free years, regardless of the taxing expectations of her chosen vocation, Ritsuko understood a bit of Misato's proclivities, of her weaknesses and strengths, and kept that woman's behavior in check whenever she stepped out of line, such as her legendary beer binges or her affair with Ryoji Kaji, who was then majoring in philosophy.  
在那无忧无虑的岁月里，尽管所选职业的期望压力重重，律子还是对美里的习性、她的弱点和优点有所了解，并在她行为失当时加以约束，比如她那传奇般的啤酒狂欢或是与碇元渡的恋情，当时他正在攻读哲学专业。

Oh, she really liked the man and his charms, but Ritsuko had become all too used to living without men, unable to comprehend them completely, ever since her mother divorced her father at the age of four.  
哦，她确实喜欢那个男人和他的魅力，但自从四岁时母亲与父亲离婚后，Ritsuko 已经习惯了没有男人的生活，无法完全理解他们。

Ritsuko remembered her mother's lecture at the dinner table, as they ate their breakfast:  
Ritsuko 记得母亲在餐桌上的训诫，当时她们正在吃早餐：

"_Where's Daddy?" Ritsuko asked. She was wearing a kindergartener's yellow smock, and her book bag rested against the leg of the chair she was sitting on. Both mother and daughter were eating their breakfast of instant noodle bowls, as they were in a hurry to catch the 7:30 train._  
“爸爸在哪里？”Ritsuko 问道。她穿着幼儿园孩子的黄色围裙，书包靠在她坐的椅子腿上。母女俩正匆忙地吃着方便面早餐，以便赶 7:30 的火车。

_Naoko, in her customary purple turtleneck sweater and black slacks, shook her head. "He's not coming back."  
直子穿着她惯常的紫色高领毛衣和黑色长裤，摇了摇头。“他不会回来了。”_

_Ritsuko frowned. "Why?" 律子皱起眉头。“为什么？”_

"_Don't think about him, don't say anything," Naoko answered. "Remember that. Do you know why I kept you at your bedroom? Wonder why we're shouting every night?"_  
“不要想他，不要说任何话，”直子回答。“记住这一点。你知道我为什么让你待在卧室里吗？想知道我们为什么每晚都在争吵吗？”

"_Why?"_

_Naoko looked frustrated, but kept her composure. "Don't get mad at me, but I'm through with that sonofabitch, and you don't want someone like him for you to marry someday. You can't trust men anymore, and all they do is to make lies and promises, while they hide their scruples and affairs from you."  
直子看起来很沮丧，但仍保持着镇定。“别生我的气，但我已经受够了那个混蛋，你将来也不想嫁给像他那样的人。你不能再相信男人了，他们只会撒谎和许下承诺，同时对你隐瞒他们的道德瑕疵和婚外情。”_

_Taken aback with the response, Ritsuko blinked. "Mommy, I still don't understand."  
被这番话惊到，律子眨了眨眼。“妈妈，我还是不明白。”_

_Naoko sighed, as if wondering if her child could sense the depth and complexity of adults and their troubles, and of the extent of the divide that preceded the divorce.  
直子叹了口气，仿佛在想她的孩子是否能感受到成年人的深度和复杂性，以及在他们离婚之前就存在的鸿沟。_

"_Listen to me," Naoko said, staring at Ritsuko, who stopped eating and put down her chopsticks. "You want to live a happy life?"_  
"听我说，"直子说道，盯着丽素，后者停止了进食，放下筷子。"你想过上幸福的生活吗？"

"_Yes," Ritsuko answered._ "是的，"丽素回答道。"

"_I want you to succeed, so that someday you would never experience the same pain as I have. Study hard as much as you can, and should you get in trouble, ask for my help; don't deny it. You're my daughter and you're the only family I have left, and I don't want to lose you. Got it?"_  
"我希望你能成功，这样有一天你就不会经历我所经历的痛苦。尽你所能努力学习，如果遇到麻烦，向我求助；不要拒绝。你是我的女儿，也是我唯一的家人，我不想失去你。明白了吗？"

_Ritsuko silently nodded._

"_I know you're a smart little girl, and you should stay that way. Don't let anyone put you in second place, ever. Choose your friends carefully, and be careful when they lie against you, and if they ever betray you, leave them and never look back. If you must love someone someday, don't let your heart get in the way; think before you feel, or your heart could be broken. Understand?"_  
"我知道你是个聪明的小女孩，要保持这样。不要让任何人把你放在次要位置，永远不要。慎重选择你的朋友，当他们对你撒谎时小心提防，如果他们背叛了你，离开他们，永不回头。如果将来有一天你必须爱上某人，不要让你的心冲昏头脑；在感受之前先思考，否则你的心可能会碎。明白吗？"

"_Yes, Mommy."_

_Naoko reached out her arm over the table to extend a pinky and Ritsuko did the same, coupling both of their fingers in a vow of promise.  
直子伸出手臂越过桌子，伸出小指，律子也做了同样的动作，两人的手指勾在一起，许下了一个承诺。_

"_Promise me that you'll do what I say, okay?" she said._  
"答应我你会照我说的做，好吗？" 她说。

"_I will, Mommy… I love you, too."_  
"我会说的，妈妈…我也爱你。"

_Naoko smiled, even as she used the gesture to hide the bitterness in her heart.  
直子微笑着，尽管她用这个动作来掩饰内心的苦涩。_

Ritsuko blinked, wondering why her mind suddenly veered that way. She then groaned, blaming herself for having too many things to worry about, and she fought the urge to light up yet another cigarette to cure the anxiety. So instead she took a deep breath; inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly, trying to slow down her heart rate.  
律子眨了眨眼，不明白自己的思绪为何突然转向那里。她随后叹了口气，责怪自己有太多事情需要担心，并努力克制再次点燃香烟来缓解焦虑的冲动。于是她深吸了一口气；吸气，呼气，再吸气，再慢慢呼气，试图减缓心跳的速度。

Relieved, she rose from the chair and walked up to Fuyutsuki, who was watching his subordinates pack up their papers, preparing to leave for lunch.  
她松了一口气，从椅子上站起来，走向正在监督下属整理文件准备去吃午饭的冬月。

"Yes?" Fuyutsuki asked. “什么事？”冬月问道。

"Sir, mind if you can tell Misato that I'll be waiting for her outside?" Ritsuko said.  
“长官，您能告诉美里我会在外面等她吗？”律子说。

The old man nodded. "You may do so," he answered. "Don't worry, I'll be here, and if you're needed, I'll ask Miss Ibuki to fetch you."  
老人点了点头。“你可以这么做，”他回答道，“别担心，我会在这里，如果需要你，我会让伊吹小姐来叫你。”

"Thank you, sir," Ritsuko said before she pivoted and walked away.  
“谢谢您，先生，”律子说完，转身离开了。

As he watched the woman leave, Fuyutsuki hoped that today Misato and Ritsuko settle their animosities properly as grown women.  
看着她离去的背影，冬月希望今天美里和律子能像成熟女性一样妥善解决她们之间的不和。

In the locker room, perhaps another first for her as she took off her plug suit, Asuka was happy enough to know that finally Unit-02 was once more part of her life. It didn't matter if she obtained a beginner's sync rate; it was important that her mother made her presence and she knew damn well she'll be safe.  
在更衣室里，这或许是她的又一个第一次，当她脱下插入栓服时，明日香感到非常高兴，因为终于二号机再次成为她生活的一部分。即使她的同步率只是初学者的水平，这并不重要；重要的是她的母亲再次出现，并且她清楚地知道她将是安全的。

Throughout the stability test, Asuka avowed to keep her personal encounter with her mother a secret between them, and even if the Sub-Commander pressed for an explanation, she'll just shrug and say it's all just a fluke.  
在整个稳定性测试过程中，明日香发誓要将她与母亲的私人遭遇保密，即使副司令追问解释，她也会耸耸肩，说这一切都只是巧合。

From the gym bag, Asuka pulled out her favorite yellow sundress and some underwear, and then laid them on the bench, before picking up her towel and draped it over her shoulder.  
从健身包里，明日香拿出她最爱的黄色太阳裙和一些内衣，然后将它们放在长椅上，接着拿起毛巾搭在肩上。

"Are you done?" Shinji asked. The boy was hanging around outside the locker room, waiting whilst Misato and the Eva crew chief were talking, and Asuka guessed that Kaworu and Rei must be having some quiet sweet nothings as they glanced at the red Eva right over the platform.  
“你好了吗？”真嗣问道。男孩在更衣室外徘徊，等待着美里和 EVA 机修组长交谈的间隙，明日香猜测渚薰和绫波一定在平台上远远望着红色 EVA，轻声细语地说着些甜蜜的琐事。

"Not yet," Asuka responded. "Just a few more minutes for a shower."  
“还没呢，”明日香回答，“再洗几分钟就好了。”

"Okay," Shinji agreed.

Once she walked into the shower stall and turned the faucet open, Asuka let the water blast downwards. The last time Asuka was here, she was then falling apart, and right at this very spot she cursed herself, repeatedly punching the separator wall after her sync rate hit zero.  
当她走进淋浴间并打开水龙头时，明日香任由水流直冲而下。上次明日香在这里时，她正处在崩溃的边缘，就在这个地方，她咒骂着自己，同步率归零后反复捶打着隔墙。

But not today. She felt totally in peace with herself, with little to worry about, even as she knew they were far from safe from danger; if needed be, she'll defend herself again.  
但今天不同。她感到内心完全平静，几乎没有什么可担忧的，尽管她知道他们远未脱离危险；如果有必要，她会再次保护自己。

Turning down the shower head flow, Asuka picked up the bar of soap and began to lather it up over her body, to take away the LCL odor that sometimes remained after being soaked in the Entry Plug.  
调低花洒的水流，明日香拿起肥皂，开始在身上搓出泡沫，以去除浸入插入栓后有时会残留的 LCL 气味。

She wondered what was coming up after this, and then she figured that if an Angel showed in the neighborhood, no problem, she'll rise to the challenge again. But rather than fighting alone, she'll want Shinji by her side and give him a chance to have a crack at the enemy.  
她想知道接下来会发生什么，然后她想，如果有天使出现在附近，没问题，她会再次迎难而上。但这次她不想独自战斗，她希望真嗣能陪在她身边，给他一个机会去对付敌人。

But then she wondered in what form their next opponent would be. Hopefully the next confrontation should be easy as cake, not like the last time when the Angel had the crushing advantage at around 210 kilometers above the Earth, until Rei threw the Spear to put its lights out.  
但她又想知道下一个对手会是什么形态。希望下一次的对决能像吃蛋糕一样轻松，不像上次那样，天使在地球上方约 210 公里的高空占据压倒性优势，直到绫波投出长矛才让它熄火。

No, Asuka disagreed; she'll rather have the enemy bring it on, throw everything even the kitchen sink, and would be glad to give those bastards her best game face.  
不，明日香不同意；她宁愿敌人全力以赴，连厨房水槽都扔过来，她会很高兴地向那些混蛋展示她的最佳状态。

While Shinji and his companions waited outside, Crew Chief Kasuga walked up to Misato and he said, "Colonel, you're being summoned at the control room."  
当真嗣和他的同伴们在外面等待时，组长春日步走到美里面前，说道：“上校，控制室有您的召见。”

Misato blinked. "By whom?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“谁召见？”

"Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki would like you to talk to Doctor Akagi. She's waiting by the hallway."  
“副司令官冬月希望您与赤木博士谈谈。她正在走廊那边等您。”

The woman sighed. "Okay, I'll be there in a minute," she said, before turning her attention to Shinji, Kaworu and Rei. "Guys, I'm being needed up there."  
女人叹了口气。“好吧，我马上就到，”她说着，然后将注意力转向了真嗣、薰和绫波。“伙计们，我需要上去一趟。”

"Why?" Shinji asked. “为什么？”真嗣问道。

"Doctor Akagi arrived, and I must talk to her," Misato said.  
"“赤木博士到了，我必须和她谈谈，”美里说。”

Shinji nodded. "Okay, but is it all right if the four of us go first for lunch?"  
真嗣点点头。“好的，不过我们四个人先去吃午饭可以吗？”

Misato smiled as if to assure him. "Sure, you guys have to. Don't worry about me, okay? I'll catch up with you."  
美里微笑着，仿佛在安慰他。“当然，你们必须去。别担心我，好吗？我会赶上你们的。”

"Take care," the boy responded, yet within he wondered if Ritsuko was all right to talk, especially after what happened down at the Dummy Plug Plant.  
“保重。”男孩回应道，但内心却在想，理津子是否适合交谈，尤其是在 Dummy Plug Plant 发生那件事之后。

"I'll see you later at the Cafeteria," Misato said, before walking towards the elevator.  
"我稍后在食堂见你，" 美里说完，朝电梯走去。

Once the elevator doors closed, Rei said, "It is not the fault of Doctor Akagi."  
电梯门关闭后，绫波说："这不是赤木博士的错。"

"Why?" Kaworu asked. "为什么？" 渚薰问道。

Shinji blinked. "How did you know?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“你怎么知道的？”

"Your father had told me what she did at the Plant, but I do not blame her," the girl said. "Still, I feel it is her time to make up for all of her mistakes."  
“你父亲告诉了我她在工厂的所作所为，但我并不怪她，”女孩说，“不过，我觉得现在是她弥补所有错误的时候了。”

Just then Asuka came out of the locker room, now dressed in her yellow sundress. Wondering why Misato was gone, she asked, "Where's she?"  
就在这时，明日香从更衣室出来，换上了她的黄色太阳裙。她好奇美里去了哪里，问道：“她去哪儿了？”

"She went up," Shinji answered. "She has some business to do with Doctor Akagi."  
"她上去了，" 真嗣回答，"她有些事情要和赤木博士处理。"

"What sort of business?"  
"什么事情？"

"Redemption, I think," Rei added.  
"我想是赎罪吧，" 绫波补充道。"

"For what?"

Rei gave Asuka a noncommittal facial expression. "I am not sure," she said.  
丽给了明日香一个不置可否的表情。“我不确定，”她说。

About two hundred meters away from the control room, Ritsuko stood by one of the huge windows overlooking the Geofront grounds, the landscape extending as far as to the walls of the still-mysterious shell. In her hands she nursed an open can of warm green tea, a welcome change from her usual java she purchased from the vending machines, simply another way to make her relax in preparation for the inevitable encounter.  
离控制室约两百米远的地方，律子站在一扇巨大的窗户旁，俯瞰着地表的景色，一直延伸到那神秘外壳的墙壁。她手中捧着一罐温热的绿茶，与平时从自动贩卖机购买的咖啡不同，这是她放松自己的另一种方式，为即将到来的不可避免的会面做准备。

From the corner of her eye, she saw Misato walking right up to her. Ritsuko pivoted to confront and in a calm voice she said, "I've been waiting for you."  
她眼角余光瞥见美里正向她走来。律子转身面对，平静地说道：“我一直在等你。”

Misato nodded. "I know. You wanted to talk."  
美里点头。"我知道。你想谈谈。"

"Yes, I have to," Ritsuko said. "Let's sit down for a while," she added, gesturing that they should take a seat on the benches facing the windows.  
"是的，我必须，"律子说。"我们坐一会儿吧，"她补充道，示意她们应该坐在面对窗户的长椅上。"

Once settled on the bench, with Misato looking at her, Ritsuko set the can on the floor, took a deep breath and said, "Listen to me. I have thought about this for a time since I stayed in the Stockade… I don't know why, of all things, have found myself following Mom's footsteps and made the same mistakes as she did."  
在长椅上坐定后，美里看着她，律子把罐子放在地板上，深吸了一口气，说道："听我说。自从我待在禁闭区以来，这件事我已经思考了一段时间……我不知道为什么，在所有事情中，发现自己走上了母亲的老路，犯了和她一样的错误。"

Ritsuko ran her hand back over her chestnut-brown hair. "Do you know why I was involved with him?"  
律子将手向后梳理着她栗色的头发。“你知道我为什么会和他扯上关系吗？”

Misato shook her head. "Never. Not until now."  
美里摇了摇头。“从未有过。直到现在。”

"After Mom's death I fell for him initially out of sympathy, as he asked me back then that I must continue her work, that he couldn't live without someone to help him out. So I agreed, after he explained that without Mom it wouldn't be possible for him to continue his work."  
“在母亲去世后，我最初是因为同情而对他产生了感情，因为他当时请求我继续她的工作，说他没有别人帮助就活不下去。所以我在他解释说没有母亲他就无法继续工作后，同意了。”

Ritsuko looked up and gazed at the scenery. "God, I fell for that story. He also told me that my involvement would decide the fate of humanity, and that I could accomplish something, like finishing Mom's legacy; doesn't matter even if I get nominated for a Nobel Prize, as long as I work on the MAGI and Project E.  
"律子抬起头，凝视着风景。“天啊，我居然信了那个故事。他还告诉我，我的参与将决定人类的命运，我能完成一些事情，比如继承母亲的遗志；哪怕我因此被提名诺贝尔奖，只要我继续致力于 MAGI 和 E 计划。”

"Throughout the time I held my feelings back from everyone, especially you. I didn't want to say what I truly am, for I was afraid you might not understand me and my feelings."  
"“一直以来，我对所有人都隐藏了自己的感情，尤其是你。我不想表露真实的自我，因为我害怕你可能无法理解我和我的感受。”

Ritsuko thought of Rei and the indifference she made towards that girl. "Do you know why I hated Rei? I then thought she took away everything I had towards the Commander, and that she was responsible for my mother's suicide."  
"律子想起了零，以及她对那个女孩的冷漠。“你知道我为什么讨厌零吗？我当时觉得她夺走了我对指挥官的一切，还认为她应对我母亲的自杀负责。”

Misato looked surprised this time. "What?"  
这次美里看起来很惊讶。“什么？”

Ritsuko closed her eyes, before she explained the version of events that led to her mother's demise, of the older Akagi called a "useless hag" before she strangled the first Rei and threw herself off the ledge.  
律子闭上眼睛，然后解释了导致她母亲死亡的事件版本，老阿卡吉被称为“无用的老太婆”，在她掐死第一个丽并跳下悬崖之前。

"…and after I came out of the morgue," Ritsuko said, "I was angry, grieving, but I couldn't understand why. I thought that this other… Rei did this bad joke of hers on Mom, and after the funeral I sought for an explanation from the Commander... No, I mean, Ikari. But he told me that this Rei was an aberration, a flaw, and that I shouldn't be worried because she had replacements. But I was jealous, and in the years that followed I kept my distance professionally. Never bothered myself to view Rei as a human being, but more of an experiment."  
“…我从太平间出来后，”律子说，“我很生气，很悲痛，但我无法理解为什么。我以为这个…丽对妈妈做了这个恶作剧，葬礼后我向司令…不，我是说，碇源堂寻求解释。但他告诉我这个丽是个畸形，是个缺陷，我不应该担心，因为她有替代品。但我很嫉妒，在接下来的几年里，我保持了职业上的距离。从未费心将丽视为一个人，而更多地把她当作一个实验对象。”

Ritsuko pursed her lips and added, "You wonder why I tend to be cold towards the Children; I was asked not to have any feelings while I do things to them, I was told not to be too concerned about their lives... But I did so out of obeying Ikari, of satisfying his needs. I don't care as long as he even had his hands over my body, as long as he appreciated and supported my work."  
律子噘起嘴唇，补充道：“你好奇为什么我对孩子们总是冷冰冰的；我被要求在他们身上做事时不要有任何感情，被告知不要过于关心他们的生活……但我这样做是出于服从碇，满足他的需求。只要他甚至把手放在我身上，只要他欣赏和支持我的工作，我就不在乎。”

The woman scientist bowed her head, and with her fingers pinched her tear ducts.  
女科学家低下头，用手指捏住泪腺。

"Yet… Yet I was really a fool—" Ritsuko whispered.  
“然而……我真是个傻瓜——”律子低声说道。

Misato shook her head. "No, don't torture yourself again," she reminded. "You're not what you think."  
美里摇了摇头。“不，不要再折磨自己了，”她提醒道。“你不是你所想的那样。”

"I know… As I was in jail, I regretted being involved in this… scheme. I wished I was somebody else. I wished I was never born this way, and I wished Mom should've given a chance to make up my mind a long time ago."  
“我知道……我在监狱里时，后悔卷入了这个……阴谋。我希望我是另一个人。我希望我从未以这种方式出生，我希望妈妈很久以前就给我一个机会来弥补我的决定。”

"I understand what you mean," Misato said. "It's impossible to go back and undo everything. What matters is now and tomorrow."  
“我明白你的意思，”美里说。“回到过去并撤销一切是不可能的。重要的是现在和明天。”

"That's right," Ritsuko agreed. "I also think that's what Fuyutsuki had in mind when he sprang me out. Anyway, I have decided to save myself the anguish, which I must have this albatross taken off my shoulders. And to get there, I want to help you."  
"没错，" 律子同意道，"我也认为这是副校长放我出来的用意。无论如何，我决定不再让自己受这痛苦，必须卸下这个包袱。为此，我想帮助你。"

"Help?" Misato asked. "帮助？" 美里问道。

"Look, you're not alone in this," Ritsuko said, looking concerned, "and certainly you can't hack this all by yourself, and it could get you killed. I don't want you to wind up like Kaji, so you need help as part of my penance."  
"听着，你不是一个人，" 律子显得很关切，"你肯定不能独自应对这一切，这可能会让你丧命。我不想你落得像加持一样的下场，所以你需要帮助，这也是我赎罪的一部分。"

"I know I can't do this alone, but how could I trust you this time?" Misato questioned, yet inwardly it was clear that Ritsuko has finally made up her mind, following Kaworu's earlier admission.  
"我知道我不能独自完成这件事，但我这次怎么能信任你呢？" 美里质问道，但内心清楚，在碇真嗣之前的坦白后，律子终于下定了决心。

"I finally figured out what Kaji was really after," Ritsuko said. "Not because his employers asked him for it, but because he feared what would happen if forbidden power goes into the wrong hands, and humanity's fate could go with it."  
"我终于明白了加持真正追求的是什么，" 律子说。"不是因为他的雇主要求他这么做，而是因为他害怕禁忌的力量落入错误之手，人类的命运也将随之改变。"

Misato frowned. "Are you going to fight the Man?" she asked, with a veiled reference to Commander Ikari.  
美里皱眉。"你要对抗那个人吗？" 她问道，暗指碇司令。

"Not directly," Ritsuko answered. "There's a smarter way to do just that, without us having to get hurt. Besides, if we are to honor Kaji's memory, it's up to us to accomplish where he failed. This is our risk to take, and once we find out, we'll uncover what we know."  
"并非直接如此，" 律子回答道，"有一种更聪明的方法可以达到同样的目的，而不必让我们受伤。此外，如果我们想要纪念加持的记忆，那么就由我们来完成他未竟的事业。这是我们承担的风险，一旦我们查明真相，就能揭开我们所知的一切。"

From the pocket of her lab coat, Ritsuko produced the souvenir from Kaji, a keychain with a stylized face of a cat on the fob, and handed it over to Misato, who held and examined it with two fingers.  
律子从她的实验服口袋里拿出了加持的纪念品，一个带有猫脸图案的钥匙扣，递给了美里，美里用两根手指夹着仔细端详。

"It's from him," Ritsuko said. "He said he bought this keychain in Matsushiro, but it really came from Kyoto because I saw something like that while attending a university symposium there."  
"这是他给的，" 律子说，"他说他在松代买了这个钥匙扣，但实际上它来自京都，因为我曾在那里参加大学研讨会时见过类似的东西。"

Misato returned the cat keychain back to Ritsuko, and the woman pocketed it.  
美里将猫咪钥匙扣还给了律子，律子将其放进了口袋。

"I still don't know what he was up to right there," Ritsuko admitted.  
“我还是不明白他当时在搞什么鬼，”律子坦承道。

"So do I," Misato agreed.  
“我也是，”美里附和道。

For a while both women paused for a half-minute to let the memories sink in.  
有那么一会儿，两位女士都停顿了半分钟，让那些记忆沉淀下来。

"Remember the night we all three of us went out for a drink?" Ritsuko said, breaking the silence.  
“还记得我们三个人一起去喝酒的那个晚上吗？”赤木律子打破了沉默。

"Well, yes," Misato answered.  
“嗯，记得，”美里回答道。

Ritsuko smiled wistfully. "You said he didn't change, but he said otherwise because he's also living."  
律子微笑着，带着一丝怀旧。“你说他没变，但他却说变了，因为他也在生活。”

"And you said about homeostasis and transis… What was that?" Misato said, fumbling on the spelling.  
“你提到过稳态和什么来着…那是什么？”美里说着，拼写上有些迟疑。

"Transistasis," Ritsuko corrected her.  
“是‘变迁态’，”律子纠正她道。

"And if I correctly quote you and Kaji right…" Misato said, "the power to preserve the status quo, and then the power to change; and the thing which has those two contradictory properties is life, and men and women represent them."  
"如果我没记错你和加持的话……" 美里说道，"维持现状的力量，以及改变的力量；而拥有这两种矛盾属性的东西就是生命，男性和女性则分别代表了它们。"

Ritsuko nodded approvingly. "Not bad," she praised. "You damn remember very well, even after knocking back ten mugs of beer and six shot-glasses of vodka that night."  
律子赞许地点点头。"不错嘛，"她称赞道，"你居然记得那么清楚，哪怕那晚喝了十杯啤酒和六小杯伏特加。"

Misato grinned; relieved that somehow Ritsuko was getting her old groove back. "Thanks. Is that an estimate?"  
美里咧嘴一笑；庆幸律子似乎找回了往日的风采。"谢谢。这是估算吗？"

"More like a guesstimate based on how much you booze," Ritsuko quipped.  
"更像是基于你喝了多少酒的猜测，" 律子打趣道。

Both women chuckled for a while until Misato gave Ritsuko a serious expression.  
两位女士笑了一会儿，直到美里严肃地看着律子。

"What?" Ritsuko asked. "什么？" 律子问道。

"You're not alone," Misato said. "This isn't our only fight for both of us."  
"你并不孤单，"美里说。"这不仅仅是我们两人的战斗。"

Ritsuko looked surprised. "Who else?"  
律子看起来很惊讶。"还有谁？"

"Hyuga, Odani, and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. They're all deep in this as we are, and they're all worried as to where the Man and the Committee could be leading us into."  
"日向、狩矢，还有副司令冬月。他们都和我们一样深陷其中，也都担心那个男人和委员会会把我们引向何方。"

"Good," Ritsuko said. "Since you want to finish the puzzle, and I think I still have my security clearances intact, I'll give you some more pieces. Only then we'll see if we could stop Frankenstein's monster before it goes out of control."  
“很好，”律子说，“既然你想完成这个拼图，而且我想我的安全权限应该还在，我会再给你一些碎片。只有这样，我们才能看看是否能在弗兰肯斯坦的怪物失控之前阻止它。”

In unison both women stood up. Ritsuko stared at Misato and asked, this time in a reconciliatory tone. "Now… After all those years of denying you, can you forgive me this time?"  
两位女士齐声站了起来。律子凝视着美里，这次用一种和解的语气问道：“现在……经过这么多年对你的否认，这次你能原谅我吗？”

Misato nodded, but inwardly surprised once she saw Ritsuko's eyes well up with tears, and they came cascading down her cheeks. "Yes, it's all right," she answered. "You still have a chance to live, to be what you wanted to be…"  
美里点头，但内心惊讶地看到律子的眼眶涌出泪水，泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落。“是的，没关系，”她回答，“你还有机会生活，成为你想成为的人……”

"T… Thanks," Ritsuko whispered before she hugged Misato, and the woman wept on her shoulder, sobbing.  
“……谢谢。” 律子低声说道，随即拥抱了美里，美里靠在她肩头痛哭失声。

Once more Hamamoto reported to Commander Ikari in his office, and again he was resistant to the cold stare behind the glasses. Inwardly Hamamoto wondered if the Commander wore something else other than his customary dress uniform, the same unbuttoned coat that revealed the suspenders holding up the man's pants. The old director knew well the Commander never wore anything else since the first day NERV was founded, and he also remembered that, hearing the tongues of old-timers who worked here even before the organization's establishment, the Commander once used to wear a lab coat, and it was unusual that a scientist should be made a leader of a paramilitary organization.  
又一次，Hamamoto 向 Ikari 指挥官报告，在他的办公室里，再次面对那副眼镜后冰冷的目光。Hamamoto 内心暗自揣测，指挥官是否除了他那惯常的军装外，还穿过别的衣服，那件总是敞开的外套，露出支撑裤子的背带。这位老主任清楚地记得，自 NERV 成立的第一天起，指挥官就从未换过装束，他还记得，听那些在组织成立之前就在这里工作的前辈们说，指挥官曾经穿过一件实验室外套，一个科学家被任命为半军事组织的领导者，这确实非同寻常。

Hamamoto sighed, deciding that it was time to break the wordless impasse, after he watched the Commander finish reading the report.  
Hamamoto 叹了口气，决定是时候打破这无声的对峙了，他看着指挥官读完了报告。

"So," Gendo said. "You handed the terrorists over to the American CIA agents."  
“那么，”源度说，“你把恐怖分子交给了美国中情局的特工。”

Two hours ago Hamamoto contacted the FBI liaison at the US Embassy in Tokyo-2, who then arranged a helicopter pickup to take the captured International Resistance men from NERV custody, to be extradited back to the United States. He never batted an eye, as he watched the terrorists, handcuffed, spouted claims of torture and other allegations while being dragged away by grim-faced Marines to a waiting pair of US Navy SH-60 Seahawk helicopters on the helipad.  
两小时前，滨本联系了在东京-2 美国大使馆的 FBI 联络官，随后安排了一架直升机从 NERV 手中接走被捕的国际抵抗组织成员，以便将他们引渡回美国。他目不转睛地看着那些手铐加身的恐怖分子，在被面色严峻的海军陆战队员拖向停机坪上待命的美国海军 SH-60 海鹰直升机时，高声宣称遭受酷刑和其他指控。

"That's right, sir," Hamamoto said. "Whatever information we gleaned from those terrorists is satisfactory enough, as we need to concentrate on uncovering the rest of the mole network as soon as possible."  
“没错，长官，”滨本说，“我们从这些恐怖分子那里获得的信息已经足够令人满意，我们需要集中精力尽快揭露其余的鼹鼠网络。”

Gendo propped both hands to form a tent over the desk. The typical Ikari position. "How much time do you need to solve this case?"  
源度双手撑在桌上，形成了一个帐篷状。典型的碇式姿态。“你需要多少时间来解决这个案件？”

"Well, sir, I do not wish to make estimations," Hamamoto reminded, "but it should be finished within forty-eight hours… Maybe even less if we finally have all the evidence in place and assembled together, especially with the data from Oda."  
“嗯，长官，我不愿做出估计，”滨本提醒道，“但应该在四十八小时内完成……如果所有证据都到位并汇总在一起，尤其是来自织田的数据，甚至可能更快。”

"Now, even though it's too early for you, do you know who's responsible for Oda? And who are his handlers?"  
“现在，虽然对你来说还太早，你知道谁负责织田吗？还有他的处理者是谁？”

Hamamoto cleared his throat. "This maybe far-fetched, sir, but Oda exchanged information with a group somewhere in Europe, and we traced them to several corporations down in Dresden."  
滨本清了清嗓子。“这可能有些牵强，先生，但织田与欧洲某地的组织交换了信息，我们追踪到了德累斯顿的几家公司。”

"Germany," Gendo added. “德国，”碇源堂补充道。

"That's right, sir," Hamamoto agreed. "In that report, there's a short list of possible suspects. We've already placed a signals interception watch on several of them, and should there's an unusual increase in activity, we'll mark them."  
“没错，先生，”滨本赞同道。“那份报告里有一份简短的嫌疑人名单。我们已经对其中几人进行了信号拦截监控，一旦发现异常活动增加，我们就会标记他们。”

Gendo nodded, as he didn't need to mention to Hamamoto that the suspect firms in the list were mostly under SEELE's control through a welter of owners and impenetrable partnerships, and so he decided on another course of action, something they can handle easily; the old men would come later.  
源渡点了点头，他无需向滨本提及名单上的可疑公司大多通过一系列复杂的所有者和难以穿透的合伙关系受 SEELE 控制，因此他决定采取另一种行动，一种他们可以轻松应对的行动；那些老头子们稍后再说。

"Disregard the German suspects," Gendo said, his expression becoming cross. "Deal with the remaining mole first. Who knows, he might be even lurking within your office."  
“忽略德国的可疑目标，”源渡说道，表情变得严厉，“先处理剩下的内鬼。谁知道，他可能就潜伏在你的办公室里。”

Hamamoto blanched, caught unawares. He felt like as though he was punched in the stomach.  
滨本脸色苍白，猝不及防。他感觉仿佛被一拳打在了肚子上。

"How can I trust your word if there's the possibility of betrayal in _your_ department?" Gendo questioned. "History tells us that the worst enemies are _inside_, and often they are well-hidden, not bringing attention to themselves. In our cause, it's the reason why sometimes we're in trouble."  
"如果你们部门存在背叛的可能，我怎能相信你的话？" 碇源堂质问道。"历史告诉我们，最恶劣的敌人往往来自内部，而且他们通常隐藏得很深，不引人注目。在我们的使命中，这就是为什么我们有时会陷入困境的原因。"

"But…" Hamamoto trailed, futilely trying to find some way to placate Gendo.  
"但是…" 滨本犹豫不决，徒劳地试图找到安抚碇源堂的方法。

"Do not hesitate; look into _your_ backyard first," Gendo commanded. "Make the most of your forty-eight hours, and whatever you do would make or break you."  
"不要犹豫；先审视你自己的后院，" 碇源堂命令道。"充分利用你的四十八小时，你所做的一切将决定你的成败。"

Inwardly Hamamoto was fuming, but kept his composure. "Yes, sir. We'll act on it."  
内心深处，Hamamoto 怒火中烧，但表面上仍保持镇定。“是的，长官。我们会采取行动。”

"And another thing, Director," Gendo said. "As far as the Fifth Children is concerned, anything up with the surveillance?"  
“还有一件事，局长，”Gendo 说道，“关于第五适格者，监控方面有什么进展吗？”

"Yes, sir," Hamamoto said. "We've programmed the surveillance cameras to track Nagisa just about anywhere here, so about thirty minutes ago we manage to spot him with Colonel Katsuragi."  
“是的，长官，”Hamamoto 回答，“我们已经将监控摄像头编程为几乎可以追踪 Nagisa 在这里的任何地方，所以大约三十分钟前，我们成功发现他与 Katsuragi 上校在一起。”

Gendo frowned. "And what he's doing with her this time?"  
源度皱起眉头。“这次他又和她搞什么名堂？”

"They could be talking just about anything," Hamamoto said, not sure about the relationship between those two, as CCTV cameras only recorded video but not audio unless they plaster a room with listening bugs. "But I'll see if we could also acquire some audio surveillance."  
“他们可能只是在谈论任何事情，”滨本说，不太确定这两人的关系，因为监控摄像头只记录视频而不录音，除非他们在房间里布满窃听器。“但我会看看能否也获取一些音频监控。”

"Act on it," Gendo said. "I want to know what he's up to, and if he turns out to be a bad apple… I want him captured _alive_. You understand?"  
“采取行动，”源度说。“我要知道他在搞什么鬼，如果他真是个坏家伙……我要活捉他。明白吗？”

The old director blinked for a second, thinking about asking why and what plans Ikari had for Nagisa, but then decided otherwise; he nodded, for he had to follow orders if he intended to keep his job till retirement.  
老导演眨了眨眼，本想问一问为何以及碇有什么计划针对渚，但随即改变了主意；他点点头，毕竟如果他想在退休前保住工作，就得服从命令。

"Yes, sir. It's not going to be a problem," he answered. "We'll handle it."  
“是的，先生。不会有问题的，”他回答道，“我们会处理好的。”

The four Children walked amongst the crowd, mostly on their way to the Cafeteria. Rei watched Shinji and Asuka walking in unison, hands together, while Kaworu was beside her.  
四个孩子走在人群中，大多是在去食堂的路上。丽看着真嗣和明日香并肩而行，手牵着手，而薰则在她旁边。

Inwardly Rei nearly forgot Ritsuko, and she wondered what that doctor thought of her this time. Was she angry at her? Was she afraid? Is it because of the Commander?  
内心深处，丽几乎忘记了律子，她想知道这次那位医生对她有何看法。她是否在生她的气？她是否感到害怕？是因为司令吗？

She didn't know for sure, because it had been days since the last time she saw Doctor Akagi, who was above her the first time she opened her eyes, on the bed since the destruction of Unit-00. At that moment, Ritsuko stared at her while holding a clipboard, before she summoned Rei to sit erect and went through the motions of examining the First Children's chest with a stethoscope.  
她并不确定，因为自从上次见到赤木博士已经过去好几天了，第一次睁开眼睛时，博士就在她上方，那时零号机刚被摧毁，她躺在床上。那一刻，律子拿着病历板盯着她，然后示意丽坐直，用听诊器检查了第一适格者的胸部。

Throughout the examination Ritsuko said nothing except for mentioning her vital signs, before going to the IV drip and checked the flow rate, adjusting the drip valve, and wordlessly left the room.  
在整个检查过程中，律子除了提及她的生命体征外一言不发，然后走到静脉输液架旁检查流速，调整滴液阀门，默默地离开了房间。

Rei, however, was able to read the signs in Ritsuko's eyes despite the seemingly calm and clinical demeanor in the woman's face: desperation, anger, longing, bitterness, the want and the need.  
然而，尽管律子脸上保持着平静而专业的表情，丽却能从她的眼神中读出那些迹象：绝望、愤怒、渴望、苦涩，以及那种欲望和需求。

As if he managed to sense the girl's dilemma through psychic contact, Kaworu asked, "What's wrong, Ayanami?"  
仿佛通过心灵感应察觉到了女孩的困境，薰问道：“怎么了，绫波？”

"I am not sure about Doctor Akagi," Rei said almost quietly.  
“我不太确定赤木博士，”丽几乎轻声说道。

"Because you don't know whether she's angry or afraid of you, I think."  
"因为你不知道她是生气还是怕你，我想。"

"That is what is in my mind. I am worried."  
"这就是我心里的想法。我很担心。"

Kaworu smiled. "Not when you're with me," he said. "If ever she wants to talk to you, I'll be with you, is it all right?"  
渚薰微笑道：“有我在就不怕，”他说，“如果她想和你说话，我会陪着你，这样可以吗？”

Rei nodded, feeling relieved that Kaworu wanted her to be happy. "Yes. Thank you again."  
丽点点头，感到欣慰的是渚希望她幸福。“是的。再次感谢你。”

Asuka, having overheard the conversation, swiveled her head and asked, "What's wrong, Wondergirl? Trouble with Doctor Akagi?"  
明日香无意中听到了对话，转过头问道：“怎么了，三无少女？和赤木博士有麻烦吗？”

"I do not know what she feels about me this time," Rei answered.  
“我不知道她这次对我的感觉如何，”丽回答道。

"Hey, we're all in this together," Asuka reassured, "and if you need some help, tell me."  
“嘿，我们都在一起面对呢，”明日香安慰道，“如果你需要帮助，告诉我。”

Shinji asked, "Ayanami, why don't we talk about it right at the table? You know, it'll be better if you could share what you're feeling about."  
“绫波，我们为什么不就在桌边谈谈呢？你知道，如果你能分享你的感受会更好。”真嗣问道。

Asuka nodded. "That's right."  
明日香点头道：“没错。”

Once more Rei nodded and said, "That would be acceptable."  
Rei 再次点头，说道：“那样可以接受。”

Misato reached deep into her pocket for a handkerchief and gave it to Ritsuko, who daubed it on her cheeks and eyes.  
美里从口袋深处掏出一块手帕递给律子，律子用它轻拭脸颊和眼睛。

"Thanks," Ritsuko said as she returned the hankie. She felt relieved this time. "Would you like to get to the bottom of what's going on?"  
“谢谢，”律子归还手帕时说道。这次她感到释然。“你想弄清楚到底发生了什么吗？”

"That's right," Misato answered.  
“没错，”美里回答道。

"Now, if my memory serves correctly, there's about twelve gigabytes of data accumulated in the last ten years, but I think it could be a lot longer than that. Most of them are records, log data, memos, journals, video clip recordings, pictures… the whole nine yards, all of it classified top secret and only three of us have access, you know."  
“现在，如果我没记错的话，过去十年间积累的数据大约有十二吉字节，但我觉得可能比这还要久远。其中大部分是记录、日志数据、备忘录、日记、视频片段、图片……应有尽有，全部被列为绝密，只有我们三个人有权访问，你知道的。”

"I see. What else?"

"Several of them will give you a clear picture of what really happened down at Antarctica," Ritsuko said. "The documents also have your father's name on it, and he'd been deep into that fiasco. I'm sure you haven't seen them, right?"  
“其中几份会让你清楚地了解南极到底发生了什么，”律子说，“这些文件上也有你父亲的名字，他深陷那场混乱之中。我确信你还没看过它们，对吧？”

Misato shook her head. "Not yet. When you could show them to me?"  
美里摇了摇头。“还没。你什么时候能给我看？”

"First, we need to bring anyone involved together, and start piecing the evidence we all have. Now, do you have something else? The stuff that Kaji left for you, I think?"  
“首先，我们需要把所有相关人员聚集起来，开始整合我们各自掌握的证据。现在，你还有别的吗？我想是加持留给你的东西？”

"Yeah. For one, he left a flash memory card and I haven't got to open it. But Hyuga came up with some very interesting information on what the Committee's up to."  
“是的。一方面，他留下了一张闪存卡，我还没来得及打开。但日向带来了一些关于委员会动向的非常有趣的信息。”

Ritsuko blinked. "Like what?"  
律子眨了眨眼。“比如什么？”

Misato looked around, making sure that no one was eavesdropping, and she said, "Sorry, but they have built several new Evas."  
美里环顾四周，确保没人偷听，然后说道：“抱歉，但他们已经制造了几台新的 EVA。”

Speechless, this time Ritsuko looked as if she was hit with a two-by-four, before she said, "I don't understand… How did the hell they manage to come up with… How many?"  
这次律子哑口无言，仿佛被一记重击，她才开口：“我不明白……他们究竟是怎么做到的……有多少台？”

"My source said there are nine," Misato said. "From the snapshots, they're probably are of advanced design, and all painted white. By now they've probably attained operational capability."  
"我的消息来源说有九架，"美里说，"从快照来看，它们的设计可能相当先进，而且全部涂成了白色。现在它们很可能已经具备了作战能力。"

Ritsuko frowned. "That is not really good," she muttered. "Too many Evas running around with only one Angel coming isn't just overkill; it could mean something else."  
律子皱起眉头。"这可不是什么好消息，"她低声说，"这么多 EVA 对付一个使徒，不仅是杀鸡用牛刀；这可能意味着别的事情。"

"Yeah," Misato agreed, "and unless there's a massed Angel assault, which I think is too far-fetched, do you guess there's something _more_ to the Evas than simply to kill Angels?"  
"是啊，"美里同意道，"除非有一大群使徒来袭，我觉得这太牵强了，你觉得这些 EVA 除了杀使徒之外，还有别的用途吗？"

Ritsuko remembered a faint memory of her conversation with Gendo, as they watched Unit-01 being cleaned up in the holding cage, attended by the maintenance crew as they directed the full blast of pressurized water cannons washing away the Angel gore:  
律子依稀记得与源堂的对话，那时他们正看着零号机在拘禁笼中被清理，维修人员用高压水炮全力冲洗着使徒的残骸：

"_Mind if I say something?" Ritsuko asked after adjusting her raincoat._  
“介意我说句话吗？”律子调整了一下雨衣后问道。

"_Sure," Gendo said, his agreement almost a grunt._  
“当然，”源堂应道，他的同意几乎像是一声咕哝。

"_I'm worried about this," Ritsuko said as she squinted from the fine mist. "I have never felt this before, but that Eva has been more horrible than today… So, is Eva truly on our side?"_  
"我对这个很担心，" 律子眯着眼睛从细雨中说道，"我从未有过这种感觉，但那台 Eva 比今天还要可怕……所以，Eva 真的站在我们这边吗？"

_Gendo kept his eyes on the cleanup crew. "Why?"  
源渡一直注视着清理人员。"为什么？"_

"_It may hate us, and Major Katsuragi may be aware of something about what we're really doing."_  
"它可能憎恨我们，而葛城美里少校可能察觉到了我们真正在做的事情的一些端倪。"

_The bearded Commander nodded. "I see. For now, however, that is not an issue and you're not supposed to be worried about them. We're still in control."  
留着胡须的指挥官点了点头。“我明白了。不过目前这还不是问题，你们不必为此担忧。我们仍然掌控着局面。”_

"_But if Rei and Shinji know the secrets of the Evas, they may never forgive us."_  
“但如果丽和真嗣知道了 EVA 的秘密，他们可能永远不会原谅我们。”

_Gendo sighed. "Why do you have to worry when everything is going according to plan?"  
碇叹了口气。“为什么你要在一切按计划进行时还担心这些呢？”_

And earlier they argued about Shinji's plight as he was trapped in Unit-01, which in turn was trapped in the Angel's Sea of Dirac:  
而早些时候，他们争论着真嗣被困在初号机中的困境，而初号机本身又被困在使徒的狄拉克之海中：

_Misato blinked, as she heard Ritsuko's only method of rescuing Unit-01.  
听到律子唯一的救援初号机的方法时，美里眨了眨眼。_

"_Forced salvaging?" she asked, almost stammering._  
“强制打捞？”她问道，几乎有些结巴。

_Ritsuko sighed. "It's the only way that might work."  
律子叹了口气。“这是唯一可能奏效的方法。”_

"_How?"_

"_Dropping 992 N2 bombs in the central portion," Ritsuko said, pointing at the map of Hakone tacked to the whiteboard, "timed to within the activation of the two remaining Eva's AT-Fields to interfere with the imaginary circuit of the Angel. In that moment, we concentrate enough explosive energy to blow off the Angel along with the Sea of Dirac that forms its body."_  
“在中心区域投下 992 枚 N2 炸弹，”律子说着，指向钉在白板上的箱根地图，“时间精确到两台剩余 EVA 的 AT 力场激活，以干扰天使的虚像电路。在那一刻，我们集中足够的爆炸能量，将天使及其构成身体的狄拉克之海一并炸毁。”

_Now that explained why those American B-52 bombers, orbiting high above their heads, were present in huge numbers; they all carried N2s in their bellies and affixed to wing pylons.  
这下解释了为什么头顶高空盘旋着大量美国 B-52 轰炸机；它们的机腹和翼架上全都挂载着 N2 炸弹。_

_This time Misato looked shocked. "But…" she stammered. "You know Eva's body can't... Shinji wouldn't... Good God, that's no rescue ops!"  
这次美里看起来震惊了。“但是…”她结巴道。“你知道 Eva 的身体不能…真嗣不会…天哪，那可不是救援行动！”_

"_Getting Unit One's body intact is top priority," Ritsuko countered. "Nothing else. It doesn't matter if the body is destroyed."_  
“确保初号机身体完好是首要任务，”律子反驳道。“其他一切都不重要。即便身体被毁也无所谓。”

"_Wait a second… What do you mean?" Misato angrily questioned._  
“等一下…你是什么意思？”美里愤怒地质问。

"_The pilot's life is irrelevant," Ritsuko answered nonchalantly. "He's expendable."_  
"飞行员的性命无关紧要，" 律子漠不关心地回答，"他是可以牺牲的。"

_Grunting, Misato clenched her fist, crackling the knuckles, and then flattened out that palm and in one swift motion she slapped Ritsuko across the cheek, causing the other woman to cry out. She almost spun into the nearest console top, knocking several folders off the top onto the floor.  
米莎咬牙切齿，紧握拳头，指节咔咔作响，随即手掌一展，猛地一挥，一巴掌扇在律子脸上，后者痛呼出声，差点撞上最近的控制台，几份文件从台面上散落一地。_

"_You…" Ritsuko muttered, wincing from the pain. "It'll be your fault if you screw up and lose Shinji right down there. It's your responsibility!"_  
"你……" 律子痛得皱眉，低声道，"如果你搞砸了，让真嗣在那下面出事，那就是你的责任！"

"_I FUCKING KNOW!" Misato yelled back. "That's my job and I know it, yet the Children under me are not expendable as you think! They're KIDS! HUMAN! I care about them! What's the goddamn reason you and Commander Ikari are so damn anal about Unit One? What is Eva?"_  
"我他妈的知道！" 美里吼回去。"那是我的职责，我清楚得很，但我的孩子们不是你认为的可以随意牺牲的！他们是孩子！是人！我关心他们！你和碇司令到底为什么对初号机这么执着？Eva 到底是什么？"

_Startled by Misato's verbal explosion, the other personnel in the command truck rose from their seats, and they looked ready to restrain Misato and Ritsuko should things come to worse, like an all-out catfight.  
被美里的爆发性言辞吓了一跳，指挥车内的其他人员从座位上站了起来，他们看起来已经准备好随时出手，以防事态恶化成一场全面的混战。_

"_You already know about it," Ritsuko said. "We've given you the information. Why the hell you want more than that?"_  
"你已经知道这些了，" 律子说。"我们已经把信息都告诉你了。你他妈的还想知道什么？"

"_Bullshit," Misato cursed. "All I'm getting is bullshit."_  
“胡扯，”美里咒骂道，“我听到的全是胡扯。”

_Ritsuko rubbed her cheek and said, "You'll have to trust me, Misato. I'm commanding_ everything _in this operation, and so you either take it or leave it. That's an order!"_  
律子揉了揉脸颊，说道：“美里，你得相信我。这次行动由我全权指挥，所以要么接受，要么放弃。这是命令！”

_Without another word Misato pivoted, and then stormed out of the mobile command truck, slamming the door behind her.  
美里一言不发地转身，然后气冲冲地走出了移动指挥车，重重地摔上了门。_

"_You're such a hopeless wino," Ritsuko muttered under her breath, as she picked up the tossed folders on the floor._  
"你真是个无可救药的酒鬼，" 律子低声嘟囔着，弯腰捡起被扔在地上的文件夹。

"I'm sorry about the last time we argued about this," Ritsuko said. "I know, and now you can ask me everything."  
"上次我们为此争吵，我很抱歉，" 律子说道。"我知道，现在你可以问我任何问题了。"

"Right," Misato said. "First of all… _What is Eva?_"  
"好吧，" 美里说。"首先……Eva 是什么？"

Ritsuko sighed and stared closely at her friend.  
律子叹了口气，紧紧地盯着她的朋友。

"Eva isn't just a mobile, Angel-killing machine," she answered. "Eva is also an instrument for Instrumentality, or that's what the Commander told me. How it was made for that purpose is a very complicated process."  
“EVA 不仅仅是一台移动的使徒杀戮机器，”她回答道，“EVA 还是实现人类补完计划的工具，至少这是司令告诉我的。它是如何被制造出来用于这一目的的，是一个非常复杂的过程。”

"Fuyutsuki told me it is a man-made god."  
“冬月告诉我，它是一个人造的神。”

Ritsuko nodded. "Of course. All of them are constructed from Adam's genetic material, but only Unit One is very unique because she was made from Lilith."  
律子点头道：“当然。她们都是用亚当的基因材料构建的，但初号机非常独特，因为她是由莉莉丝制造的。”

Misato blinked. "_Lilith?_ What Lilith?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“莉莉丝？哪个莉莉丝？”

The lady doctor pointed downward, as to emphasize Lilith's existence. "She's right beneath us, and to be clear, even if they look similar, Lilith is _different_ from Adam."  
女博士向下指了指，以强调莉莉丝的存在。“她就在我们脚下，明确地说，尽管她们看起来相似，但莉莉丝与亚当是不同的。”

"So… So that means there are _two_ of them right now."  
“所以… 这意味着现在有两个他们。”

It was Ritsuko's turn to be startled. "What two?"  
轮到律子吃惊了。“哪两个？”

Misato explained about her earlier private conversation with Natsumi, who admitted Adam's existence and how she personally operated on Gendo's left hand to attach the creature. By the time Misato was finished, Ritsuko was blinking thrice.  
美里解释了她之前与夏美的私人谈话，夏美承认了亚当的存在，并讲述了她是如何亲自在源堂的左手上进行手术，将那个生物附着上去的。等到美里说完，律子已经眨了三次眼。

"Really?" she said. “真的吗？”她问道。

Misato nodded. "That's right. Now the question is, with Adam and Lilith right here in the Geofront, what's gonna happen if any of them would be used? To what purpose? I don't think they're here simply to be displayed like a house deity."  
美里点头。“没错。现在的问题是，亚当和莉莉丝就在地底都市，如果他们被利用了会怎样？出于什么目的？我不认为他们只是被摆在这里当个摆设。”

Ritsuko sighed, and said, "As we all know, we use the Evas to keep the Angels from making contact with either Adam or Lilith, to prevent another Impact from happening. However… If my memory serves me right, I was told that if ever Adam and Lilith come in contact with each other, it's possible to have a Third Impact."  
律子叹了口气，说道：“众所周知，我们使用 EVA 来阻止使徒接触亚当或莉莉丝，以防止另一次冲击发生。然而……如果我没记错的话，我曾被告知，如果亚当和莉莉丝相互接触，可能会引发第三次冲击。”

Misato frowned. "Who said that?"  
美里皱了皱眉。“谁说的？”

"Ikari. He's really doing all the planning and research for the Instrumentality Project, and then he gives out the orders for us to work on. Now if you could only see his quarters…" she trailed, but then blinked. "Have you understood Cabbalism?"  
“碇。他真的在做所有关于人类补完计划的规划和研究，然后给我们下达工作指令。现在如果你能看看他的房间……”她话音渐弱，随即眨了眨眼。“你理解卡巴拉主义吗？”

"Cabbalism? Well… No," Misato answered, shaking her head. "I have no idea, except maybe for that diagram the Commander has right up on the ceiling of his office."  
“卡巴拉主义？嗯……不，”美里回答，摇了摇头。“我完全不懂，除了指挥官办公室天花板上那张图。”

"That's the Athanasius Kirchner Sephirotic System diagram, which is really the Tree of Life," Ritsuko clarified, before explaining that the diagram's creator was a Christian mystic and scientist who published around 40 works, most notably in the fields of oriental studies, geology, and medicine. He penned the diagram, which originally appeared in his work _Oedipus Aegyptiacus_, published between 1652 and 1654.  
"那是阿萨纳修斯·基尔舍纳的卡巴拉生命树系统图，实际上就是生命之树，" 律子解释道，随后说明该图的创作者是一位基督教神秘主义者和科学家，他发表了约 40 部作品，尤其在东方学、地质学和医学领域颇有建树。他绘制了这幅图，最初出现在他 1652 年至 1654 年间出版的《埃及奥狄浦斯》一书中。

Going further, Ritsuko said that the Tree of Life (_Etz HaChayim_) is a term from the Hebraic system of exegesis, named _Qabalah_ (or either _Kabbalah_ or _Cabala_), to describe a diagram composed of 10 Numbers and 22 Letters. Hence, adherents of that belief system were called Cabbalists.  
律子进一步解释说，生命之树（Etz HaChayim）源自希伯来释经体系，名为卡巴拉（或称卡巴拉或卡巴拉），用以描述由 10 个数字和 22 个字母组成的图表。因此，信奉这一信仰体系的人被称为卡巴拉主义者。

The Sephirotic diagram was used to describe the path to God, and the manner in which He created the world out of nothing. The Cabbalists developed this concept into a full model of reality, using the tree to depict a "map" of creation. The Tree of Life has been called the "cosmology" of the _Kabbalah_.  
卡巴拉生命树图用于描述通往上帝的路径，以及上帝如何从无中创造世界的方式。卡巴拉主义者将这一概念发展成一个完整的现实模型，用生命之树描绘出创造的‘地图’。生命之树被称为卡巴拉的‘宇宙论’。

Of late, some scientific quarters had stumbled upon the conceptual similarities between the Kirchner diagram and the radical Superstring Theory, which was a new cosmological model in which the multidimensional universe was made up not three but _ten unique dimensions_, all interacting like taut vibrating strings in a violin; and in addition, six dimensions were entangled as one like a braided rope.  
近来，一些科学界人士偶然发现了基什内尔图与激进的超弦理论之间的概念相似性，这是一种新的宇宙学模型，其中构成多维宇宙的不是三个而是十个独特的维度，所有维度像绷紧的小提琴弦一样相互作用；此外，还有六个维度像编成的绳索一样纠缠在一起。

"How did you know all that?" Misato questioned skeptically.  
“你怎么知道这些的？”美里怀疑地问道。

"Picked them up from _Nature, Scientific American…_ and _The Complete Zohar,_" Ritsuko said, before she shrugged. "The last, though, it's really a big old book… I couldn't read Hebrew, unfortunately, but only the diagrams and drawings in that book are very obvious to anyone involved in cosmology."  
“从《自然》、《科学美国人》……还有《佐哈尔全集》中学到的，”律子说，然后耸了耸肩，“不过，最后一本，真是一本大部头……可惜我看不懂希伯来文，但那本书中的图表和插图对从事宇宙学的人来说非常明显。”

"Okay, so what does that diagram and all the Cabbalist mumbo-jumbo has got to do with Project E and the Evas?"  
“好吧，那张图和那些卡巴拉神秘学的胡言乱语跟 E 计划和 EVA 有什么关系？”

"In a way… Ikari uses it as a 'map', a blueprint in which he can find out as to which direction the Evas should be evolving, and it's not as simple as from Point A to Point B."  
“从某种意义上说……碇司令把它当作一张‘地图’，一个蓝图，借此他可以确定 EVA 应该朝哪个方向进化，这并不像从 A 点到 B 点那么简单。”

Misato scratched her head, now that her confusion was growing. "I don't get it. Sounds too far-fetched."  
美里挠了挠头，她的困惑越来越深。“我不明白。听起来太牵强了。”

"All right, I'm cutting out the bullshit," Ritsuko answered, concerned about Misato's inability to comprehend. "Let's get to the point."  
"好了，我不再兜圈子了，" 律子回答，对美里无法理解的情况感到担忧。"我们直奔主题吧。"

"Okay."

"According to Ikari, Adam and Lilith are _not_ of this world," Ritsuko admitted. "They're aliens, really. I'm not joking this time or getting high on something."  
"根据碇的描述，亚当和莉莉丝并非来自这个世界，" 律子承认道。"它们实际上是外星生物。这次我不是在开玩笑，也没有嗑药。"

Misato was suddenly wide-eyed. "WHAT?"  
美里突然瞪大了眼睛。"什么？"

"No little green men," Ritsuko answered. "No xenomorphs, and no flying saucers either. Fact is, we're in what used to be an ancient spacecraft – the Geofront is the _spacecraft_."  
"没有小绿人，" 律子回答道。"没有异形，也没有飞碟。事实上，我们所在的地方曾经是一艘古老的宇宙飞船——地底都市就是那艘飞船。"

"Impossible," Misato muttered.  
"不可能，" 美里喃喃自语。"

"Notice how smooth the Geofront's dome's curvature is? Well, the margin of difference in the radii between two points of the dome is no more than 0.00001 millimeters, and in fact, some years ago the old-timers here measured its curvature with lasers as part of their site survey. No human can build a dome _that_ smooth and without any expansion gaps, reinforcement bars or special tricks, and only a very advanced civilization can create a structure like this immense – and they did it _eons ago_."  
"注意到地底都市穹顶的曲率有多平滑吗？实际上，穹顶上任意两点间的半径差异不超过 0.00001 毫米，而且几年前，这里的老人用激光测量过它的曲率，作为他们的现场勘测的一部分。人类无法建造出如此平滑且没有任何伸缩缝、加固条或特殊技巧的穹顶，只有极其先进的文明才能创造出这样的巨大结构——而且是在亿万年前。"

"You mean the Geofront is also _very old_?"  
"你是说地底都市也很古老？"

Ritsuko nodded. "That's right. Even the rock that consists of the main 40-meter-thick shell is of extraterrestrial origin – some of the rock sampled from the shell had ten elements that don't really belong to the Periodic Table, and when they also determined the age of the rock by carbon dating... The Geofront is more than _three billion years old_, and where it came from... We'll never know. Now how does this tie up with Adam and Lilith? This Geofront… is Lilith's _home_, and the one that blew up Antarctica... that's where Adam's Geofront used to be."  
律子点头。"没错。就连构成主要 40 米厚外壳的岩石也是来自外太空——从外壳中取样的岩石含有十种元素，它们并不真正属于元素周期表，而且通过碳同位素测定岩石的年代……地底都市已有超过三十亿年的历史，至于它来自何方……我们永远无从知晓。那么，这与亚当和莉莉丝有何关联呢？这个地底都市……是莉莉丝的家园，而那个在南极爆炸的……则是亚当地底都市的所在地。"

Misato suddenly coughed as if choked on her saliva; she couldn't believe what Ritsuko was saying.  
美里突然呛咳起来，仿佛被口水噎到；她无法相信律子所说的话。

"Of course, those facts aren't fit for public consumption; if we did otherwise, UFO believers would be flocking here like mad," Ritsuko quipped. "The world would've also go nuts if the truth ever gets out."  
“当然，这些事实不适合公开；否则，UFO 信徒们会像疯了一样涌来，”律子打趣道，“如果真相泄露，世界也会陷入疯狂。”

"Okay, you're damn right. This'll be just between us, okay?"  
“好吧，你说得对极了。这事就我们俩知道，行吗？”

Ritsuko nodded. "I know. Don't worry about any leakages."  
律子点头，“我明白。不用担心泄露问题。”

"Thanks," Misato said. "Another question: what does Adam and Lilith has to do with Instrumentality? And what about the Evas?"  
"谢谢，"美里说道。"另一个问题：亚当和莉莉丝与人类补完计划有什么关系？还有那些 EVA 机体呢？"

The question was downright direct, and to Ritsuko the only answers she could bring up were enshrined in one of the 50-terabyte solid-state hard drives somewhere in the innards of the MAGI.  
这个问题直截了当，对律子来说，她能想到的答案都深藏在 MAGI 系统内部某处一个 50 太字节的固态硬盘里。

"Hard to say," she said, trying to figure out the right words to explain it all. "But there are _two_ ways for a Third Impact to happen."  
"很难说，"她试图找出合适的词来解释这一切。"但引发第三次冲击有两种方式。"

"How?" Misato asked. "怎么做到的？" 美里问道。

"The first way, the one that has been told you, and I hope you remember, is an Angel finally making physical contact with Adam… Or Lilith, and once that happens, every life-form in the planet, all based from Lilith, will be eliminated with an anti-AT Field, and the Angels will be the ones left on Earth."  
"第一种方法，就是你们所被告知的那种，我希望你们还记得，是某个使徒最终与亚当……或者莉莉丝发生物理接触。一旦这种情况发生，地球上所有源自莉莉丝的生命形式，都将被反 AT 力场消灭，而使徒将成为地球上仅存的生物。"

"Doomsday…" Misato whispered, imagining how that terrible scenario would work out: total extinction.  
"世界末日……" 美里低声呢喃，想象着那可怕的情景如何上演：彻底的灭绝。

"That's right, I'm afraid, and in case you wanted proof that such a circumstance works in that way… Tell you what, it's the Second Impact. Do you really know what happened there?"  
“没错，恐怕是这样，而且如果你需要证据证明这种情况会那样发生……告诉你吧，这就是第二次冲击。你真的知道那里发生了什么吗？”

Misato shook her head. "No. You know Father and the others in the expedition died right there."  
美里摇了摇头。“不。你知道父亲和其他远征队的人就在那里丧生了。”

"Well, the reason why they wound up dead is that they tinkered around with Adam," Ritsuko answered.  
“嗯，他们之所以丧命，是因为他们摆弄了亚当，”律子回答道。

"I know. Dad was totally nuts about the Super Solenoid Engine. What really happened there?"  
"我知道。爸爸对超级螺线管引擎痴迷得不得了。那里到底发生了什么？"

Ritsuko sighed and shook her head. "I was once asked by Ikari to watch the surveillance footage, to understand precisely what went wrong and how we have to prevent that incident from happening again. From what I could remember, the expedition group researchers had the Spear delivered from Israel days ago, and later they inserted it into Adam to see if they could examine the full functionality of the S2 Engine."  
律子叹了口气，摇了摇头。"我曾被碇司令要求观看监控录像，以准确了解出了什么问题以及我们如何防止那次事件再次发生。据我所记得的，探险队的研究人员几天前从以色列运来了朗基努斯之枪，随后他们将其插入亚当体内，以检查是否能全面测试 S2 引擎的功能。"

"And then…?"

"For some stupid reason, somebody in your father's team must've injected genetic material into Adam at the same time they pierced it with the Spear, which caused a destructive runaway effect and generated an anti-AT Field. Eventually this Field began to consume anything in its growing radius, including the research facility, and it spared nothing; until at some point the excess energy generated by Adam was released spontaneously, causing a massive explosion equivalent to between 200 to 500 megatons of TNT… and the rest is history. Fortunately, the Spear somehow managed to contain most of the damage by limiting the Field's spread, and right now the Spear that Rei used to kill one of the Angels is the same one that came from Antarctica."  
"出于某种愚蠢的原因，你父亲团队中的某人一定是在用长矛刺穿亚当的同时注入了遗传物质，这导致了破坏性的失控效应并产生了反 AT 力场。最终，这个力场开始吞噬其增长半径内的任何东西，包括研究设施，它无所不包；直到某个时刻，亚当产生的过量能量自发释放，引发了一场相当于 200 至 500 兆吨 TNT 的巨大爆炸……剩下的就是历史了。幸运的是，那支长矛不知何故设法通过限制力场的扩散来遏制大部分损害，而现在零使用来杀死一位使徒的那支长矛正是来自南极的那一支。"

"Shit," Misato cursed. "What about the second one? Where do the Evas fit into the picture?"  
"该死，"美里咒骂道。"那第二个呢？EVA 在这幅图景中扮演什么角色？"

"That's what I'm thinking about, because you mentioned about nine new operational Evas. Now if they were to have their own S2 Engines, that's when we could be in deep trouble because if they replicate the exact circumstances of Second Impact, and then if the Spear makes its presence at the same time…"  
"这正是我在思考的，因为你提到了九台新的可操作 EVA。现在如果它们各自拥有 S2 引擎，那我们可能就麻烦大了，因为如果它们重现第二次冲击的精确情况，然后如果那支长矛同时出现……"

At that point Misato realized who could be the next victim in that scenario. "Don't tell me Unit One could be their target," she said.  
就在那时，美里意识到谁可能是这场阴谋的下一个受害者。“别告诉我初号机会是他们的目标，”她说。

Ritsuko blinked. "Why not? It's the only Eva with an S2 Engine, of course we really have to give her great care, and… Good God," she snapped her fingers, "It makes sense. You're right, it would be logical for them to use Unit One for Third Impact… Those bastards, they're trying to bring us all down!"  
律子眨了眨眼。“为什么不会？它是唯一拥有 S2 引擎的 EVA，当然我们必须给予它极大的关注，而且……天哪，”她打了个响指，“说得通了。你说得对，对他们来说利用初号机引发第三次冲击是合乎逻辑的……那些混蛋，他们想把我们都拖下水！”

"What?"

Ritsuko stood up and said, "If that's going to be the case, then we have to do something to stop it."  
律子站起身来说道：“如果情况真是这样，那我们必须采取行动阻止它。”

Misato rose to her feet, asking, "Like how?"  
美里站起身来，问道：“比如怎么？”

Ritsuko placed her hands upon Misato's shoulders. "Listen, sister," she said. "More than ever, and if that happens, it's gonna be up to Shinji and Asuka to stop these rogue Evas, or we all end up losing."  
律子将双手放在美里的肩上，说：“听着，姐妹，”她说，“比以往任何时候都更加重要，如果这种情况发生，将取决于真嗣和明日香来阻止这些失控的 Eva，否则我们都会输。”

"I know, but before that we'll have to deal with the next Angel," Misato whispered.  
“我知道，但在那之前我们得对付下一个使徒，”美里低声说。

Ritsuko blinked, withdrawing her hands away. "Angel?"  
律子眨了眨眼，收回双手。“天使？”

Misato nodded. "That's right. In fact, however," she said, smiling, "he _doesn't_ have to make contact with Adam."  
美里点头。“没错。实际上，”她微笑着说，“他不必与亚当接触。”

Now Ritsuko was more surprised than ever, and both women were indeed surprising themselves a great deal for more than thirty minutes. "What? Come again?"  
现在律子比以往任何时候都更加惊讶，两位女士确实在超过三十分钟的时间里不断让自己感到意外。“什么？再说一遍？”

"Don't tell anyone." "别告诉任何人。"

"Again, no problem," Ritsuko promised.  
"再次强调，没问题，" 律子承诺道。"

"Good."

"Who's this Angel, then?"  
"那么，这个使徒是谁？"

"Kaworu Nagisa."

Those two words were enough to leave Ritsuko's mouth gaping open in total astonishment. "Shit. T… That _boy?_ The Fifth Children? Really?"  
仅仅这两个词就足以让律子目瞪口呆，完全惊呆了。“该死。那……那个男孩？第五适格者？真的吗？”

"That's correct," Misato confirmed. "Now if you're not sure, you can try asking Doctor Odani, because she's the one who managed to find out by checking his DNA sample. But don't worry, I can handle him. He's under my command now."  
“没错，”美里确认道，“如果你不确定，可以试着问一下小谷医生，因为她就是通过检查他的 DNA 样本才发现的。不过别担心，我能应付他。他现在归我指挥。”

Ritsuko felt unsure about Kaworu's loyalties. "For whom he's working for?"  
律子对渚薰的忠诚感到不确定。“他究竟为谁工作？”

"The Committee, which I think are the same ones responsible for ordering the construction of those rogue Evas."  
"委员会，我想就是那些负责下令建造那些失控 Eva 的家伙。"

"Then why he's walking around?" Ritsuko asked, sounding a bit more worried. "He could do something—"  
"那他为什么还能到处走动？" 律子问道，语气中多了几分担忧。"他可能会做些什么——"

Misato cleared her throat, and said, "Kaworu swore to me that he's _not_ going to make contact with Adam because… He and Rei have fallen in love. With the capital L… and by the way, he's not going to follow the Committee's orders either."  
美里清了清嗓子，说道：" 渚薰向我发誓，他不会与亚当接触，因为……他和绫波已经相爱了。带着大写的 L……而且顺便说一句，他也不会听从委员会的命令。"

For about twenty seconds Ritsuko was speechless, before she chuckled and then asked, "What's love got to do with this?"  
"大约有二十秒钟，律子无言以对，随后她轻笑一声，问道：“爱情在这件事里有什么关系？””

Misato laughed. "Tina Turner isn't involved at all," she quipped. "Perhaps Cupid is. But seriously, I'll let you into his plan."  
"美里笑了起来。“蒂娜·特纳可没掺和进来，”她打趣道，“或许是丘比特吧。但说正经的，我这就告诉你他的计划。””

"What plan?"

The next thing Misato outlined Kaworu's unusual scheme, and afterwards Ritsuko commented, "He's nuts. He could do something wrong while he tries."  
"接下来，美里详细说明了薰的非同寻常的计划，之后律子评论道：“他疯了。他尝试的过程中可能会出错。””

"He can handle himself," Misato reassured her. "If you're still not sure, I can let you talk to him. He knows what he's doing."  
“他能照顾自己，”美里安慰她说，“如果你还不放心，我可以让你和他谈谈。他知道自己该做什么。”

Ritsuko sighed, and then she checked her wristwatch. Ten minutes past twelve. "Come on, I think the Children are waiting for us to join them for lunch," she said. "We're damn late."  
律子叹了口气，然后看了看手表。十二点十分。“快点，我想孩子们在等我们一起吃午饭，”她说，“我们迟到了。”

Misato nodded and smiled. "Okay. All right, let's go."  
美里点点头，微笑道：“好的。好吧，我们走。”

**Author's Notes:** it's been more than two weeks since the last chapter, all because I had a block and at the same time found myself having too much time for work, leaving little time to write. But in that same timeframe, as part of my research I reviewed some downloaded Eva video clips to get a good grip on the seiyuu's voices, as well as the Eva-versus-Angel action.  
作者笔记：距离上次chapter已经过去两周多了，全因我遭遇了写作障碍，同时工作时间又异常充裕，写作时间所剩无几。但在同一时期，为了深入研究，我重温了一些下载的《EVA》视频片段，以便更好地把握声优的嗓音以及 EVA 与使徒的战斗场面。

Anyway, this latter half of this chapter took much to think of, of trying to imagine how Ritsuko and Misato could rekindle their friendship by realizing that they had much something in common such as shared danger. In this same chapter, it seems that I've let a few things out of the bag earlier than usual, but it's the part of the story. I also wanted to be a little unpredictable, with some red herrings scattered about, and I'm sure that there are some loose ends left untouched.  
话说回来，这篇chapter的后半部分构思颇费心思，试图想象丽子和美里如何通过意识到彼此共同面临的危险来重燃友谊。在这篇chapter中，我似乎提前透露了一些内容，但这正是故事的一部分。我也希望增添些许不可预测性，散布一些误导线索，我确信还留有一些未触及的松散结尾。

For some action junkies out there, you just have to hang on and wait; ditto for those hoping to catch me rendtering that (in)famous part of Episode 24; and don't worry about me losing focus on our two couples (no, make that three if we add our ACC couple in the mix), we'll see them in the next few more chapters.  
对于那些热衷于动作场面的读者，请耐心等待；同样，期待我重现第 24 集那（不）著名片段的读者也请稍安勿躁；不必担心我会忽视我们的两对情侣（不，应该是三对，如果算上我们的 ACC 情侣的话），我们将在接下来的几章中看到他们的身影。

Finally, there's one more thing I'd like to say: I'm dedicating this chapter to the late **Satoshi Kon** and **Melody** **Gersbach**, both of them tragically passed away a few days between them; so promising, a lot to live for, and yet all too soon.  
最后，还有一件事我想说：我将这部《一千零一夜》献给已故的今敏和梅洛迪·格斯巴赫，他们不幸在短短几天内相继离世；他们才华横溢，本有无限可能，却过早地离开了我们。

More to come, folks.  
更多内容即将呈现，各位。

### Chapter 28 My Cup Runneth Over  
《一千零一夜》第 28 章 我的杯满溢

Kaworu Nagisa was present among them, seated comfortably, his _sozai_ bento box was open, ready to eat, and he remembered the first time he ate with mortals; it was an afternoon like this, busy with activity and of people talking, communicating, laughing, whining, and many others in a palette of emotions, this soup otherwise known as social interaction.  
渚薰也在他们之中，舒适地坐着，他的便当盒已经打开，准备开动，他记得第一次与凡人共进午餐的情景；那是一个像这样忙碌的下午，人们交谈着，沟通着，笑着，抱怨着，还有许多其他情绪交织在一起，这碗汤，也就是所谓的社交互动。

He thought of something else.  
他想到了别的事情。

Once, he knew Angels were higher than humans, powerful beings million times stronger than men, who were merely weak, mortal creatures they could crush so easily; they could make miracles or curses on behalf of their creator; they can will themselves to be anywhere and at any time; of course they have almost god-like powers, but are they happy? Contented? Pure? Perfect?  
曾经，他知道天使比人类更高等，是比人类强大百万倍的强大存在，而人类只是他们可以轻易碾碎的脆弱生物；他们可以代表造物主创造奇迹或施加诅咒；他们可以随心所欲地出现在任何时间和地点；当然，他们几乎拥有神一般的力量，但他们快乐吗？满足吗？纯洁吗？完美吗？

Perfection. Something that sets one apart from the rest, the one percent which mortals could do nothing but feel humbled. Yet how does the perfect being feels?  
完美。那是将某人从众人中区分开来的特质，那百分之一让凡人只能感到谦卑的存在。然而，完美者自身又作何感受？

Ah, nothing. No emotions but cold, calculating logic; they couldn't speak nor see nor hear; they are indifferent to the sufferings of those below them, as they observe, disallowing themselves to interfere with the affairs of lowly creatures.  
啊，什么都没有。没有情感，只有冰冷、精确的逻辑；他们无法言语、无法视物、无法倾听；他们对于下方众生的苦难漠不关心，只是旁观，不允许自己介入低等生物的事务。

However, Kaworu knew, from his readings about the lilim's ancient perceptions and beliefs about the Angels, they were supposedly sent to the world of mortals, to intervene and help guide the lilim in times of trouble and tribulation, and only then they were called upon by a chosen few, asking for succor when those few lilim could not do the impossible.  
然而，渚薰从他对人类古代关于天使的观念和信仰的阅读中知晓，天使本应被派遣至凡人的世界，在困境和磨难之时介入并引导人类，只有在那时，他们才会被少数被选中的人召唤，请求援助，当那些少数人类面对不可能之事时。

That was, however, some millennia ago, when lilim were past their primitive origins, as they were grasping the knowledge about their world, when the only knowledge they had was that coming from nature and of things they couldn't give a satisfactory explanation. As time passed on, and exponentially the knowledge of lilim increased, slowly superstition and animistic belief began to fade away, to be replaced and relegated to history books and studies.  
然而，那已是数千年前的往事，那时莉莉姆刚刚摆脱原始的起源，正努力掌握关于这个世界的知识，他们所知的仅限于自然界和那些无法给出满意解释的事物。随着时间的推移，莉莉姆的知识呈指数级增长，迷信和万物有灵论的信仰逐渐消退，被历史书籍和研究取代，成为过去的一部分。

Now the lilim were at the prime of their knowledge, science reigned supreme, all of it accessible, readable, to be digested, then regurgitated through discussion, exchange of ideas, and then they added more books to the collective library of mankind.  
如今，莉莉姆正处于知识巅峰，科学至高无上，所有知识触手可及，可供阅读、消化，并通过讨论和思想交流重新表达，进而为人类集体图书馆增添更多书籍。

Yet at what price? By knowledge men have become too powerful, but beset with more problems than they had two millennia ago, and the world had become divided, violent, and unforgiving, accursed with catastrophes by the dozen, and then became knowledge of many, in the form of breaking news alerts, a flash point every minute, men committing sins on a daily basis, some of them without remorse nor conscience.  
但这一切又付出了什么代价？人类因知识而变得过于强大，却面临着比两千年前更多的难题，世界变得四分五裂、充满暴力且毫不宽容，灾难频发，这些都成了众人皆知的新闻快讯，每分钟都有焦点事件，人们每日都在犯罪，有些人甚至毫无悔意或良知。

Men had become so blind with their supposed wisdom and greed, that intervention was needed once more, to correct the errors of their ways. But in this case Kaworu was given an order from one lilim, to meddle and then punish another.  
男人们因自以为是的智慧和贪婪变得如此盲目，以至于再次需要干预来纠正他们的错误。但在这种情况下，卡多鲁从一位莉莉姆那里接到了命令，去干涉并惩罚另一位。

For what good? 为了什么好处？

No, nothing except they were determined to gain control of Instrumentality. But he had seen enough suffering that he made the fateful decision, and voiced it right before Misato; he had no regret, as he wanted no more to be made as a pawn.  
不，除了他们决心掌控人类补完计划之外，别无他物。但他已经目睹了足够的苦难，于是做出了那个决定性的决定，并在美里面前大声说出了自己的想法；他毫无悔意，因为他不想再被当作棋子。

For his heart spoke out, and what better to make the most of his existence than taking sides with those who suffered the most, those who needed consolation and even a little bit of happiness, just to ease the pain of living.  
因为他的心在呼唤，还有什么比与那些受苦最深、需要慰藉甚至是一点点幸福的人站在一起，更能充分利用他的存在呢？只为减轻生活的痛苦。

Like what he was doing right now, dining with mortals, as contact and relations the greatest happiness, for no man is an island.  
就像他现在所做的，与凡人共进晚餐，因为接触和关系是最大的幸福，毕竟没有人是一座孤岛。

"Nagisa?"

Kaworu blinked, his reverie vanished instantly. He glanced at Shinji, who broke his silence. The young man gave him a quizzical look.  
渚薰眨了眨眼，沉思瞬间消失。他瞥向真嗣，后者打破了沉默。年轻人给了他一个疑惑的眼神。

"Oh, I'm sorry," Kaworu said, before he smiled and picked up his chopsticks. "I had a little thought."  
"哦，对不起，"渚薰说道，随即微笑着拿起筷子。"我刚才有点走神。"

_**Ten minutes ago…**_

In the control room, Kozo Fuyutsuki and four other subordinates under his command were the only ones left, as they cleaned up their workstations, shutting down computers, packing up folders and stuffing them into briefcases. Outside, Unit-02 was being hauled back to the holding cages for her post-activity maintenance.  
在控制室内，只有葛城美里和她的四名下属还在，他们正在整理工作站，关闭电脑，收拾文件夹并将其塞入公文包。外面，二号机正被拖回关押笼进行活动后的维护。

"Well?" Fuyutsuki asked as he instinctively swept the console with his hand. The open question was simply to hear their comments.  
"那么？" 冬月问道，他本能地用手扫过控制台。这个开放式的问题只是为了听听他们的意见。

Natsumi Odani watched the workstation computer shut down and she said, "Talk about a miracle. None of us had ever expected to see Miss Langley do a hundred-eighty turnaround, from a convalescent to a battle-ready pilot."  
Natsumi Odani 看着工作站电脑关闭，说道："真是奇迹啊。我们谁也没想到 Langley 小姐能从康复状态一下子转变为战斗准备就绪的驾驶员。"

"I agree," Maya Ibuki added. "I thought it would be impossible for her to get Unit Two working, but she did. I know that the last time she tried to sync, she was like trying push a boulder up a hill."  
"我同意，" 碇真嗣补充道，"我以为她不可能让二号机运转起来，但她做到了。我知道上次她尝试同步时，简直就像是在推一块巨石上山。"

"Right," Makoto Hyuga said. "Somehow Unit Two rejected her, and do you know why? I noticed her behavior in the weeks before she tried to—"  
"对，" 日向诚说。"不知怎么的，二号机排斥了她，你知道为什么吗？我注意到她在尝试之前几周的行为——"

"Don't say it," Maya warned, for she cringed every time she heard the word _suicide_. "We know that already."  
"别说了，" 真希警告道，因为她每次听到自杀这个词都会感到畏缩。"我们已经知道了。"

"Sorry," Makoto apologized. "She was then downright angry after the Angel that attacked her somehow cut down her will to fight."  
"抱歉，" 日向道歉。"在那之后，她完全愤怒了，因为袭击她的使徒不知怎么削弱了她的战斗意志。"

Natsumi sighed. "Eventually she became insecure," she said, "and I also noticed that every time she came close to the First Children she was avoiding her, turning away whenever she's present, and God knows what they probably argued about."  
夏美叹了口气。“最终她变得不自信了，”她说，“而且我也注意到每次她接近第一孩子时，她都在回避她，每当她在场时就转身离开，天知道她们可能争论了些什么。”

"Usually they don't say much," Shigeru Aoba commented. "Ever since we started, the Children usually tend to keep to themselves. Not until this week, however."  
“通常他们不怎么说话，”四郎洲翔评论道。“自从我们开始以来，孩子们通常倾向于独来独往。不过，直到这周才有所改变。”

"That's right," Fuyutsuki concurred. "Last week, much to my disappointment, they clammed-up shut away from each other, but now, all the sudden they're talking just like kids at their age. _Like normal kids_, I mean. That's another thing to celebrate about."  
“没错，”冬月同意道。“上周，令我失望的是，他们彼此封闭，互不交流，但现在，突然之间他们就像同龄的孩子一样交谈。我的意思是，像正常的孩子一样。这是另一件值得庆祝的事情。”

Fuyutsuki now picked up his briefcase and gestured at them that it was time to go. "They're waiting for us," he added, and just as they were about to leave Misato and Ritsuko walked in.  
冬月现在拿起他的公文包，向他们示意是时候离开了。“他们在等我们，”他补充道，就在他们即将离开时，美里和律子走了进来。

"Oh," Fuyutsuki said. "How did it go?" he asked.  
“哦，”冬月说。“情况怎么样？”他问道。

Both women nodded. "Everything's fine, sir," Misato answered. "We're back just like old times."  
两位女士都点了点头。“一切顺利，长官，”美里回答。“我们回来了，就像过去一样。”

Fuyutsuki chuckled. "Glad to see you two together once again," he said. "Come on, the others must be waiting, and I've got to fulfill my promise."  
冬月轻笑一声。“很高兴再次看到你们俩在一起，”他说，“快来，其他人一定在等了，我得履行我的承诺。”

"I beg your pardon, sir?" Ritsuko asked.  
“您说什么，先生？”律子问道。

"Free lunch for everyone," Fuyutsuki answered. "It's on me."  
“免费午餐给大家，”冬月回答，“我请客。”

As they were halfway to the Cafeteria, Asuka said to Shinji, "Sorry if I held this one out from you."  
当他们走到一半去食堂时，明日香对真嗣说：“抱歉，这件事我之前没告诉你。”

"About what?" the young man asked. For a second he contemplated if Kaworu and Rei were out of earshot, as the other couple walked in unison, not a word between them except for the seemingly peaceful expression on their faces.  
“关于什么？”年轻人问道。有那么一瞬间，他考虑着是否要让渚薰和绫波听不见他们的对话，因为那对情侣正并肩走着，除了他们脸上看似平静的表情外，没有说一句话。

Asuka leaned close to his ear and she whispered, "I saw Mama in the Plug."  
明日香靠近他的耳朵，低声说：“我在插入栓里看到了妈妈。”

Shinji's forehead furrowed; he couldn't believe what she was saying. "What?"  
真嗣的眉头紧皱；他无法相信她所说的话。“什么？”

The redhead laughed. "Yes, it's true. I'm not seeing things."  
红发女孩笑了。“是的，这是真的。我没有看错。”

"Uh… How?"

Asuka shrugged. "It was when my Eva powered down, she appeared out of nowhere. Was she a spirit living inside Eva? How that could happen?"  
明日香耸了耸肩。“就在我的 Eva 能量耗尽时，她突然出现了。她是不是住在 Eva 里的灵魂？这怎么可能发生？”

Shinji mulled over if it was all right for him to tell her about his own experience, a rather mixed sixteen-hour experience of self-despair (or was it the self-examination of his own weaknesses?) and then just as he was about to surrender and die, to let go and sink like a stone in a dark pond…  
真嗣思索着是否应该向她讲述自己的经历，那是一段混杂着十六小时的自我绝望（还是自我审视自身的弱点？），就在他即将放弃生命，任由自己如石头般沉入黑暗深潭之际……

_"I hate this place. I don't want to be alone... anymore. The heating and the oxygen circulation are already out. I'm cold. It's useless… the suit is giving out, too. So this is the end. I'm tired... Of it all."  
“我讨厌这个地方。我不想再孤单了……供暖和氧气循环已经停止。我感到寒冷。这身装备也快撑不住了。看来这就是终点了。我累了……对这一切。”_

_A woman appeared before him, unclothed, long hair flowing and unfurled, floating in the ether, yet despite her full figure the woman's face was obscured by the blinding light. Who was she? His mother? The Eva? He wasn't sure, but the voice somehow hit him with the realization that the voice belonged to his mother: soft, gentle, soothing, like sweet music to the ears.  
一位女子出现在他面前，赤裸着身体，长发飘逸，悬浮在虚空中，尽管身形丰满，但女子的面容却被耀眼的光芒所遮蔽。她是谁？他的母亲？还是 Eva？他不确定，但那声音却让他意识到，这声音属于他的母亲：温柔、柔和，宛如悦耳的音乐。_

_"Mother?" Shinji whispered, bewildered at the apparition.  
"妈妈？" 真嗣低声道，对这幽灵般的身影感到困惑。_

_"Are you ready? Well, that's good for you."  
"准备好了吗？嗯，那对你来说是好事。"_

"Strange," Shinji thought aloud.  
"奇怪，" 真嗣自言自语道。

"Pardon me?" Asuka questioned.  
“你说什么？”明日香问道。

The young man smiled. "No, I mean… You're no different from me, like what you've seen."  
年轻人笑了笑。“不，我是说…你和我没什么不同，就像你看到的那样。”

Asuka blinked. "You did?"  
明日香眨了眨眼。“你真的这么认为？”

Shinji nodded. "Well… Yeah, I heard her voice."  
真嗣点点头。“嗯……是的，我听到了她的声音。”

"W… How does she look like?"  
“她……她长什么样？”

"I couldn't get close enough, no, focus enough to see if she's really Mom." Shinji then sighed. "Didn't matter much, though. I was sure it was Mom by her voice."  
“我没能靠得足够近，也没能集中注意力去看她是不是真的是妈妈。”真嗣叹了口气。“不过这也不太重要，我通过她的声音就能确定那是妈妈。”

"Still, that was quite strange, and…" Asuka's eyes quickly flew wide, a thought bubbling into her mind. "Oh, I remember something. Like what Rei told me, when I was then angry at her."  
"不过，那真是相当奇怪，而且……" 明日香的眼神迅速瞪大，一个念头涌入脑海。"哦，我想起来了。就像丽那时告诉我的，当时我还对她生气呢。"

"When?"

"About two weeks ago."  
"大约两周前。"

"What did she say?"  
"她说了什么？"

"Eva has her own mind and soul."  
“伊娃有自己的思想和灵魂。”

Shinji craned his head around for a brief glance at Rei, before snapping back his attention to Asuka. "Are you sure?" he inquired.  
真嗣扭头迅速瞥了一眼丽，然后又将注意力转回到明日香身上。“你确定吗？”他问道。

Asuka nodded, before she sighed pleasantly. "Yeah, she said it… and today, she's right."  
明日香点点头，随后愉快地叹了口气。“是的，她这么说了……而且今天，她说得没错。”

The young man pondered for a moment, and he said, "Mind and soul… How can they be there in Eva?"  
年轻人沉思片刻，说道：“心与灵魂……它们怎么会在 Eva 里呢？”

"I have little idea at all," Asuka answered. "All I know are the basic functions… But they're practically biological creatures, you know."  
“我完全不清楚，”明日香回答，“我只知道一些基本功能……但它们几乎是生物性的存在，你知道的。”

Shinji now remembered his conversation with Kaji, as the spy watered his watermelons amidst the violence being played out right before them:  
真嗣此刻想起了他与加持的对话，当时间谍在暴力上演的现场，悠然地浇灌着他的西瓜：

"_They say that when an Angel comes into contact with Adam, sleeping underground here, all humanity will be annihilated," Kaji warned. "That cataclysm will be Third Impact, yet it can only be stopped by an Evangelion, which has the same power as an Angel."_  
"据说当使徒接触到地下的亚当，沉睡的亚当，全人类都将被毁灭，"加持警告道。"那场灾难将是第三次冲击，然而只有同样拥有使徒力量的 EVA 才能阻止它。"

And then Ritsuko's admission:  
随后是律子的坦白：

"_These are dummies, and they're all parts for the Dummy Plug," Ritsuko admitted. "We humans found a god and tried to possess that power, and as a consequence the human race came close to extinction fifteen years ago. The god that they found disappeared, yet they decided to remake this god."_  
“这些都是假人，它们都是用于 Dummy Plug 的部件，”赤木律子承认道。“人类找到了一个神，并试图占有那股力量，结果导致了十五年前人类几乎灭绝的后果。他们找到的神消失了，但他们决定重塑这个神。”

"_And what's this god you're talking about?" Misato asked, as she aimed her service pistol at Ritsuko's back._  
"你说的这个神是什么？"美里问道，同时将她的制式手枪对准了律子的后背。

_The frustrated scientist sighed in regret. "It's Adam, and they created a humanoid from it in order to be close to godhood… That is Eva, the ones that you see often."  
沮丧的科学家遗憾地叹了口气。"那是亚当，他们用它创造了一个类人形体，以接近神性……那就是你常看到的 Eva。"_

"All the Evas are made from Adam," Shinji whispered. "It makes sense."  
"所有的 Eva 都是由亚当制造的，" 真嗣低声说。"这说得通。"

Asuka blinked. "What?" 明日香眨了眨眼。“什么？”

"I thought you know…"  
"我以为你知道…"

"No, I have no idea about that, either. What or who's Adam? Adam as in the Bible?"  
"不，我也对此一无所知。亚当是什么？是《圣经》里的亚当吗？"

Shinji shook his head. "No. I haven't seen it, but they said that's where all the Evas came from."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“没有。我没见过，但他们说所有的 EVA 都是从那里来的。”

"When did you know all about that?" Asuka questioned. "Who told you?"  
“你什么时候知道这些的？”明日香问道。“谁告诉你的？”

"Doctor Akagi told me a week ago, a day after Ayanami blew up Unit Zero. She invited me to see her secrets."  
“赤木博士一周前告诉我的，就在绫波炸毁零号机后的第二天。她邀请我去看看她的秘密。”

Asuka frowned. "Where? This is sounding weird," she said, sounding skeptical.  
明日香皱了皱眉。“哪里？这听起来有点奇怪，”她带着怀疑的语气说道。

"It's a place called the Dummy Plug Plant. That's where they made those Plugs."  
“那地方叫模拟插入栓工厂。就是他们制造那些插入栓的地方。”

For a second Asuka craned her neck and glanced at Rei behind her. "Guess we have to keep silent," she said.  
有那么一瞬间，明日香扭头瞥了一眼身后的绫波。“看来我们得保持沉默，”她说道。

Shinji blinked. "Why?"

"Why don't we talk about it later, when we're alone?" Asuka suggested.  
“我们为什么不晚点再谈，等我们独处的时候？”明日香提议道。

The young man nodded. "N… Okay," he agreed. "If that's what you want."  
年轻人点点头。“嗯…好的，”他同意道，“如果你希望这样的话。”

---

On the other hand, Kaworu thought of the little triumph, of being able to communicate to Unit-02's core directly and speak to its troubled soul. It gave him considerable satisfaction that it took some persuasion to make that soul, whoever Asuka's mother was, to open up her heart.  
另一方面，渚薰想到了那个小小的胜利，能够直接与二号机的核心沟通，并与那个饱受困扰的灵魂对话。让他相当满意的是，要说服那个灵魂，无论是谁，明日香的母亲，打开她的心扉，确实需要一些劝说。

He thought about the doll she was holding, and its significance.  
他思考着她手中玩偶的意义，以及它所代表的象征。

Was the doll a representative of Asuka? If so, maybe that was where that soul gave most of her motherly affection, something she lost a long time ago.  
那玩偶是否象征着明日香？若是如此，或许那正是她大部分母爱的寄托所在，一种她早已失去的情感。

Now Kaworu remembered reading the dossier on Asuka and her past, in which her mother committed suicide after being involved in a test with Unit-02 resulted in a near-catastrophe.  
此刻，真嗣回想起曾阅读过关于明日香的档案，其中记载了她的母亲在参与二号机测试导致一场近乎灾难的事故后自杀身亡。

Then he recalled something else about Keel Lorenz explaining the intricacies of the Eva's functionality, where the flawed contact experiments revealed that it was possible to manipulate or even split up souls, hence the creation of the scientific field of metaphysical biology. It also explained the presence of Kaworu's clones, and by extension, what was left of Rei's copies in the Dummy Plug Plant.  
然后他想起了基尔·洛伦兹关于 Eva 功能复杂性的解释，其中失败的接触实验揭示了操纵甚至分裂灵魂的可能性，从而催生了形而上学生物学这一科学领域。这也解释了渚薰克隆体的存在，以及延伸开来，Dummy Plug Plant 中剩余的绫波丽复制体的情况。

However, Keel also told him that splitting the soul of a living entity, as confirmed by the failed Eva contact experiments, will cause insanity, LCL liquefaction or even death to the test subject. The old man added that despite the loss of lives those experiments had entailed, they only served to provide additional insights to the potential power of Evas.  
然而，基尔还告诉他，根据失败的 Eva 接触实验证实，分裂活体生物的灵魂会导致精神错乱、LCL 液化甚至死亡。老人补充说，尽管这些实验导致了生命的损失，但它们只是为了提供对 Eva 潜在力量的更多见解。

Kaworu then wondered what would happen if he could see into Unit-01's soul. It might be a very interesting exercise, and if possible, a nice conversation.  
渚薰随后想知道，如果他能窥视初号机 Unit-01 的灵魂会发生什么。这可能是一个非常有趣的尝试，如果可能的话，甚至是一次愉快的对话。

Now he whispered to himself, "So much to do, yet so little time."  
现在他低声自语，“要做的事情太多，时间却这么少。”

Rei blinked. "What do you mean?"  
丽眨了眨眼。“你什么意思？”

Kaworu sighed. "Well, I was supposed to do an errand for Misato, like watering Kaji's watermelon patch… But I don't know if we could find the time to teach you how to play the violin."  
薰叹了口气。“嗯，我本来应该帮美里办件事，比如给加持的西瓜地浇水……但我不知道我们是否有时间教你拉小提琴。”

"Pilot Soryu wants me to go to the library, to show some books for me to read," Rei said. "The ones she likes to read."  
"飞行员惣流想让我去图书馆，给我推荐一些书读，" 绫波说。"她喜欢的那些书。"

"What books?" "什么书？"

Rei was trying to remember the title of the book that Asuka mentioned, and then she said, "_Twilight._"  
绫波努力回忆着明日香提到的书名，然后她说："暮光。"

"What's it all about?"  
“这一切都是关于什么的？”

"It is a story about people and creatures called vampires. I do not know what they are."  
“这是一个关于被称为吸血鬼的人和生物的故事。我不知道他们是什么。”

"Ah. I remember reading something else," he recalled. "I had a book called _The Divine Comedy_. It's an epic poem written by an Italian man named Dante Alighieri. I have it in my room."  
“啊，我记得读过别的什么，”他回忆道，“我有一本书叫《神曲》。这是一部由意大利人但丁·阿利吉耶里所写的史诗。它在我房间里。”

Kaworu then gave Rei the basic synopsis of the story, in which Dante finds himself, with Virgil and Beatrice as his companions, on a journey to visit the three sections of the afterlife: hell, purgatory and heaven, before Dante gets a chance to see God in person.  
卡沃鲁随后向丽介绍了故事的基本梗概，其中但丁发现自己与维吉尔和贝雅特丽齐为伴，踏上了一段旅程，探访来世的三个部分：地狱、炼狱和天堂，最终但丁有机会亲眼见到上帝。

"But to tell you the truth, it's not easy reading," Kaworu admitted. "However, the important thing is that humans have a chance to come clean and redeem themselves while still alive, that they're responsible for deciding their fate through actions and thoughts."  
“但说实话，这书并不容易读，”卡沃鲁坦承道，“然而，重要的是人类在生前有机会洗净罪孽、自我救赎，他们通过行动和思想来决定自己的命运。”

"Does it include 'changing the trajectory', as you said before?"  
“它是否包含了你之前提到的‘改变轨迹’呢？”

"Yes," Kaworu said, nodding. "Everyone has an opportunity to do the right thing for a very good reason."  
"是的，" 渚薰点头说道，"每个人都有机会为了一个非常好的理由去做正确的事。"

"It seems that I still have more to learn," Rei said. "Things I still need to understand."  
"看来我还有更多需要学习，" 绫波零说，"有些事情我还需要理解。"

"But you're starting to understand, which is good for you, just as I'm trying."  
"但你已经开始理解了，这对你有好处，正如我也在努力尝试一样。"

"Such as…?"

"Human nature, and it's not enough for me to learn things simply by reading, watching or listening; I have to experience it first-hand."  
"人性如此，仅通过阅读、观看或聆听来学习对我来说远远不够；我必须亲身体验。"

"What is my nature, then?" Rei asked with curiosity.  
"那么，我的本性是什么呢？" 丽好奇地问道。"

"You are complex in some ways, and yet you have this simple innocence. You don't tell everyone much of what you know, or feel, but it's only your actions that makes people think what you really are."  
"你在某些方面很复杂，却又保持着这份纯真。你不向所有人透露你所知或所感，但正是你的行为让人们对你有了真正的认识。"

"What about you?" “那你呢？”

Kaworu's forehead furrowed, the question clearly aimed at him, so he sought for an answer. "I don't say much," he confessed. "As you know, I can't tell everyone else what I really am."  
渚薰的眉头紧锁，这个问题显然是针对他的，于是他寻找着答案。“我不怎么说话，”他坦白道，“如你所知，我不能告诉其他人我真正的身份。”

"That is what you are afraid of?"  
“这就是你所害怕的吗？”

"Yes," he admitted. "If I ever said to all what is my true purpose in this world and my reason to exist, it would be difficult for most humans to comprehend. Instead, as their prejudices have rendered them blind with misunderstanding, they will assume that my presence would not bring peace for them, but fear, suspicion, and loathing. Ignorance and the lack of understanding are one of the great defects of humanity, which is sad for me."  
“是的，”他承认道，“如果我向所有人坦白我在这个世界的真正目的和存在的理由，大多数人将难以理解。相反，由于他们的偏见使他们因误解而盲目，他们会认为我的存在不会给他们带来和平，而是恐惧、猜疑和憎恶。无知和缺乏理解是人类的一大缺陷，这对我来说很悲哀。”

"Then what can you do?"  
“那么你能做什么呢？”

"Somehow there must be a way for all to open their eyes and ears, and set aside their fears. If only I could speak to the world in one voice, and if only mankind is willing to listen, then change is possible. However, they should not be simply waiting for a deity to make the change for them… It's mankind who are supposed to take action, to change the world for the good."  
“总有一种方法能让所有人睁开眼睛、竖起耳朵，放下他们的恐惧。如果我能用一个声音向世界说话，如果人类愿意倾听，那么改变是可能的。然而，他们不应该只是等待神明为他们做出改变……应该是人类自己采取行动，为了美好改变世界。”

_**Five minutes ago…**_

In the Cafeteria, Captain Trudy Chacon and Major Paul Nguyen were seated at the table, eating their lunch. Both were wearing flight suits instead of the usual NERV khaki uniforms, their way to stand out from the rest of the crowd.  
在食堂里，特鲁迪·查康上尉和保罗·阮少校坐在桌旁，吃着午餐。两人都穿着飞行服而不是 NERV 通常的卡其色制服，以此在人群中显得与众不同。

"You still look like crap, _cabron_," Trudy commented. The whites of his eyes were pink with a slight bloodshot, as he woke up almost late with a monumental hangover.  
"你看起来还是一团糟，伙计，" 特鲁迪评论道。他醒来时几乎迟到，宿醉严重，眼白带着轻微的血丝，呈现出粉红色。

"Yeah," Paul agreed, sounding sour. "How many shots of JD do you think I had last night?" he asked before picking up a piece of steak and popped it into his mouth. "I don't remember."  
"是啊，" 保罗同意道，语气酸涩。"你觉得我昨晚喝了多少杯杰克丹尼？" 他边问边拿起一块牛排塞进嘴里。"我不记得了。"

Ordering one shot of Jack Daniel's after another at the bar, Paul drank heavily in sorrow and quiet anger, in his bid to forget what happened to his Cheyenne gunship; it pained to him to see his bird destroyed by a bunch of ragtag terrorists yesterday, and after he and his co-pilot parachuted safely on the ground Paul was hopping mad, cursing the International Resistance and its founders, and went on cussing all the way from the crash site to the Geofront until he straightened himself out and shut up for the debriefing.  
在酒吧里一杯接一杯地叫着杰克丹尼，保罗在悲伤和无声的愤怒中酗酒，试图忘记他的夏延武装直升机发生的事情；昨天看到他的飞机被一群乌合之众的恐怖分子摧毁，让他痛苦不已，而他和他的副驾驶安全跳伞着陆后，保罗怒不可遏，咒骂国际抵抗组织及其创始人，从坠机现场一路骂到地底都市，直到他整理好情绪，在简报会上才闭上了嘴。

"Let's see… About eighteen, if I'm not mistaken," Trudy answered. On that same night, she was also there at the O-Club, only for a couple bottles of Kirin as a nightcap, and she kept an eye on the Vietnamese-American for a few hours, taking a few sips of the brew, and as the bartender noted to her that Paul was about to crash off his stool, she picked up the inebriated pilot's arm onto her shoulders and led him away to his quarters.  
"让我想想……大约十八岁，如果我没记错的话，"特鲁迪回答道。就在那个晚上，她也出现在 O 俱乐部，只是为了喝几瓶麒麟啤酒作为夜宵，她留意了那位越美混血儿几个小时，时不时地抿几口啤酒，当酒保向她指出保罗快要从凳子上摔下来时，她把醉醺醺的飞行员的手臂搭在自己的肩膀上，带他离开了酒吧，送他回宿舍。

"My bad," Paul said, snorting. "I thought I had about thirty. Lost fucking count."  
"我的错，"保罗哼了一声说，"我以为我有三十岁左右。真是他妈的数不清了。"

Trudy sighed. "Look, Paul, it ain't your fault losing your bird, because sometimes shit happens to all of us. The CO has just arranged to have a spare Cheyenne to be given to you later, and it should be in the hangar bay by the time we come back."  
特鲁迪叹了口气。"听着，保罗，失去你的飞机不是你的错，因为有时候我们都会遇到这种倒霉事。指挥官已经安排给你一架备用夏安飞机，等我们回来时，它应该已经在机库了。

Paul nodded. "Yeah, I know all that, but One Three… Damn, she's a beaut, and I can make her dance. I know her like the back of my hand..."  
保罗点点头。“是的，这些我都知道，但一三号……该死，她真是个美人，我能让她翩翩起舞。我对她了如指掌……”

One Three was the official numerical designation given to his Cheyenne gunship, just as One Six was assigned to Trudy's aircraft.  
一三号是他那架夏延武装直升机的正式数字代号，正如一六号被分配给特鲁迪的飞机一样。

"Come on, you should let go. At least it's better to know that you're alive, and you did a shit-hot job out there yesterday. Planes are easier to replace than pilots, and we all know that."  
“来吧，你该放手了。至少知道你还活着，而且昨天你在那儿干得非常出色。飞机比飞行员更容易替换，我们都知道这一点。”

This time Paul sighed in resignation. "All right, you win," he conceded, before he decided that it was time to shift gears for another subject. "Let's see… Now, I don't know why the hell someone wanted a piece of the Second Children right there," he said, referring to Asuka Langley Soryu. "I mean, they said the car she was riding in looked almost like pocked Swiss cheese with the bullet holes on by the time they stopped."  
这次保罗叹息着表示了屈服。“好吧，你赢了，”他让步道，随后决定是时候换个话题了。“让我想想……现在，我不明白为什么有人会想要那里的二号机驾驶员的一部分，”他说着，指的是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。“我是说，他们说那辆车在她乘坐的时候，看起来几乎像布满弹孔的瑞士奶酪，直到他们停下来。”

By now everyone heard yesterday's story of the lone Audi, which Tsutomo Kanzaki had driven with three of NERV's well-known personages as his passengers, went through the bullet-laden crucible, and lived to tell about it.  
到现在为止，大家都听说了昨天关于那辆孤独的奥迪的故事，那是都筑筑友直驾驶的，载着三位 NERV 知名人物，经历了枪林弹雨的考验，并幸存下来讲述这一切。

"That's right," Trudy confirmed. "Yeah, I also asked myself the same question since yesterday. There's an investigation going on, I think."  
“没错，”特鲁迪证实道。“是的，昨天以来我也一直在问自己同样的问题。我想正在进行调查。”

Paul nodded again. "Right," he said. "There could be a mole on the inside, someone trying to take her down. But, what gives? Why would a bunch of yahoos want her dead?"  
保罗再次点头。“对，”他说，“内部可能有内鬼，有人想把她扳倒。但，这是为什么？一群乌合之众为何要置她于死地？”

---

At the same time, Tsutomo Kanzaki fell in line and ordered a bowl of braised beef and a tall glass of Coke. He'd been from the Second Section annex, in his cubicle and working on some paperwork, and then attended a briefing, with Director Hamamoto ordering them to keep an eye on the Fifth Children.  
与此同时，神崎堤也跟上了队伍，点了一碗炖牛肉和一大杯可乐。他刚从第二分部的附属办公室出来，坐在自己的小隔间里处理文件，然后参加了会议，滨本主任命令他们密切关注第五适格者。

Sure, he'd seen Kaworu before, when they came to visit Asuka at the Infirmary.  
当然，他之前见过渚薰，当他们来医务室探望明日香的时候。

Well, Tsutomo quizzed himself, what harm does a young man like Nagisa could do?  
嗯，堤文自问，像渚这样的年轻人能有什么坏处呢？

The agent shrugged his shoulders, figuring that he wasn't much sure, and once his tray was filled with food, he stopped by the cashier and paid, before he went looking for an empty seat when Trudy waved her hand for him to see.  
特工耸了耸肩，心里也不太确定，等他的餐盘装满食物后，他走到收银台结账，然后寻找空位，这时特鲁迪向他挥手示意。

"Hey!" Trudy hollered. "DEE KAY! Come down on here!"  
“嘿！”特鲁迪大声喊道。“D.K.！过来这里！”

Tsutomo blinked, recognizing his other nickname – Dee Kay stood for _Drift King_ – because of his superb driving skills, and then he smiled as he walked up to the two Cheyenne jocks. Trudy offered a chair and he plopped down. Placing his tray on the table, he said, "Thanks, guys. What's up for today?"  
筒本眨了眨眼，认出了他的另一个绰号——Dee Kay 代表漂移王——因为他精湛的驾驶技术，然后他笑着走向那两位夏安高中的运动员。特鲁迪递给他一把椅子，他一屁股坐下。把餐盘放在桌上，他说：“谢谢，伙计们。今天有什么安排？”

"Nothing much throughout this morning," Trudy said. "My One Six is undergoing repairs at the hangar, and Paul is due to get a spare machine to fly."  
“今天上午没什么特别的，”特鲁迪说。“我的 One Six 正在机库维修，而保罗预计会拿到一架备用机来飞。”

Tsutomo was curious about the slightly-haggard look on Paul's face. "Man, what happened?"  
筒本对保罗脸上略显疲惫的神情感到好奇。“哥们，发生什么事了？”

"Boozed last night at the O-Club," Paul answered. "Pissed about the fucking bastards who took down my ship."  
"昨晚在 O 俱乐部喝多了，"保罗回答道。"对那些击沉我船的混蛋感到愤怒。"

"I see. Had a tough day and night with my, no, I mean, _we_ had our hands full of action," Tsutomo said before he spooned his braised beef and ate. "Hands in deep kimchi, with our escorts blown off, a few dead, and several in the Infirmary right now," he added.  
"我明白了。我和我的，不，我是说，我们忙得不可开交，"堤摩西说着，舀起炖牛肉吃了起来。"陷入了大麻烦，我们的护航舰被击毁，死了几个，还有几个现在在医务室，"他补充道。"

"Yeah," Paul agreed. "At least on the bright side we had a good BDA, and we nailed them good." BDA meant Battle Damage Assessment, which was military-speak for the number of target kills, be it enemy troops, structures or vehicles.  
"是啊，"保罗赞同道。"至少从好的方面看，我们的战斗损害评估做得不错，狠狠地打击了他们。" BDA 指的是战斗损害评估，这是军方术语，指的是目标击杀的数量，无论是敌方部队、建筑还是车辆。"

"I heard about someone trying to take a crack at the Second Children. That true?" Trudy asked, now changing the subject.  
"我听说有人试图对第二适格者下手，真的吗？" 特鲁迪换了个话题问道。

Tsutomo nodded as he chewed and swallowed. "Damn right. He had a name, he sneaked in and tried to shoot her, but we caught and beat the living shit out of him, and just as we were about to get his ass hauled in for questioning, he offed himself with cyanide. Never got to know what he was really up to, or whom he was working with. Anyway, we're working on some evidence, and from there maybe we'll get some clues."  
堤人点头，边嚼边咽。"没错。他有个名字，偷偷潜入并试图开枪，但我们抓住了他，狠狠揍了一顿，正准备把他带去审问时，他用氰化物自杀了。我们始终没弄清他的真正目的或背后主使。不过，我们正在分析一些证据，或许能从中找到线索。"

"Ah, I see. Anyway, yesterday you have much balls driving right down on the road," Trudy said. "Everyone's talking about you, James Bond," she jokingly quipped, before laughing.  
"啊，明白了。话说回来，昨天你可真大胆，直接在路上飙车，" 特鲁迪说。"大家都在谈论你，詹姆斯·邦德，" 她打趣道，随即笑了起来。

"Thanks," Tsutomo said, smiling. "But I'm more like George Smiley," he added, referring to John Le Carre's unassuming intelligence agent.  
"谢谢，" 筒友笑着说，"但我更像乔治·斯迈利，" 他补充道，指的是约翰·勒卡雷笔下不起眼的情报员。

"Well, I also saw Major Katsuragi and the Children poppin' rounds on them, too, and they ain't blasting with BB guns. How are they doing right now?" she asked.  
"嗯，我也看到桂城少校和孩子们在向他们射击，而且他们用的可不是 BB 枪。他们现在怎么样了？" 她问道。

"For security reasons we had them moved and quartered here early this morning, for we figured it wasn't safe for them to stay at that condo any longer. Now, about you two, once I have some free time tonight, we go hit the O-Club and I'll pay for the beer. Drinks will be on me, 'cause I owe you much for saving our hides." This time Tsutomo grinned like a Cheshire Cat.  
"出于安全考虑，我们今天一大早就将他们转移并安置在这里，因为我们认为他们继续住在那个公寓已经不安全了。至于你们两位，等我今晚有空了，我们去 O 俱乐部，我请你们喝啤酒。酒钱算我的，因为你们救了我们一命，我欠你们太多了。" 这次筒友笑得像个柴郡猫。

"No big deal," Paul said, his face brightening up.  
"没什么大不了的," 保罗说, 他的脸亮了起来。

An idea popped into Tsutomo's brain. "Say, why don't we pull Colonel Katsuragi right with us tonight?"  
一个主意突然出现在堤文的脑海中。 "哎, 我们今晚为什么不把葛城司令一起拉上呢?"

Trudy and Paul blinked. "Hey, did you say _'Colonel'_?" she asked.  
特鲁迪和保罗眨了眨眼。 "嘿, 你刚才是说'司令'吗?" 她问道。

Tsutomo nodded. "Well, yeah. She got promoted to lieutenant-colonel last night by the Sub-Commander. Heck, she even showed me the new rank pins to prove it."  
筒友点了点头。“嗯，是的。昨晚副指挥官把她晋升为中校了。天哪，她甚至还给我看了新的军衔徽章来证明。”

Both pilots looked at each other and then they laughed.  
两位飞行员相视一笑，然后笑了起来。

"What?" Tsutomo asked, as he was a bit puzzled.  
“什么？”筒友问道，他有些困惑。

"Now that she has a higher rank, should we get her invited, guess she might have to pay the tab," Paul said amusedly.  
"既然她现在职位高了，我们是不是该邀请她，估计她得自己买单了，" 保罗打趣地说道。

"And you'll save yourself a bundle, too," Trudy added, and then all three of them guffawed.  
"这样你也能省下一笔钱，" 特鲁迪补充道，随后三人都大笑起来。

Just then Tsutomo noticed that people began to trickle into the Cafeteria, which then thickened until the whole place was filled with chatter. Troops were falling in line for the food, and gazing back to the door he saw the Children coming in, followed by the Sub-Commander and his subordinates.  
就在这时，堤文注意到人们开始陆续进入食堂，人流逐渐密集，整个地方充满了交谈声。士兵们排着队准备打饭，他回头望向门口，看到孩子们走了进来，后面跟着副指挥官和他的下属。

"Looks like we have some very interesting guests, guys," Tsutomo commented as he grinned, before the entire Cafeteria exploded into congratulatory cheers and whistles.  
“看来我们有几位非常有趣的客人，伙计们，”筒友笑着说道，随后整个食堂爆发出祝贺的欢呼和口哨声。

---

_**Now…**_

The Cafeteria was packed to capacity, everyone taking advantage of Fuyutsuki's one-day free lunch reward, and no doubt celebration was in the air as they chatted about the successful sync test, momentarily replacing the discussion about the terrorist attack.  
食堂里挤满了人，大家都趁机享受冬月一天的免费午餐奖励，毫无疑问，庆祝的气氛弥漫在空气中，他们聊着成功的同步测试，暂时取代了关于恐怖袭击的讨论。

At their table Fuyutsuki, naturally the superior officer, occupied one end of the table, and from the top downwards every one of them were seated according to rank and seniority; Misato, Natsumi and Ritsuko were closest to Fuyutsuki, followed by Kanzaki, Chacon and Nguyen, and then Ibuki, Hyuga and Aoba, and finally the Children at the other end.  
在他们的桌子上，冬月自然是上级军官，占据了桌子的一端，从上到下每个人都按照军衔和资历就座；美里、夏美和律子离冬月最近，其次是神崎、查孔和阮，然后是伊吹、日向和青叶，最后是孩子们坐在另一端。

Earlier, once gathered around the table, they made introductions, and once they sat down and ate, the officers talked about the events in the last twenty-four hours, thanked Fuyutsuki, and then congratulated Misato for her promotion.  
早些时候，当他们围坐在桌旁，互相介绍后，便坐下来用餐。军官们讨论了过去二十四小时的事件，感谢了冬月，随后祝贺美里晋升。

However, Kaworu noticed that only Doctor Akagi was quietly eating as she listened, and she dared not to gaze at Rei's way, as if trying to avoid the girl's red eyes.  
然而，薰注意到只有赤木律子博士静静地边听边吃，她不敢看向绫波的方向，仿佛在躲避那女孩的红色眼眸。

But he already knew why: through the memories of Shinji and Misato, Ritsuko destroyed what was left of the Rei clones, out of jealousy and hatred. So now, she feels responsible, and in a gathering like this, Doctor Akagi was in a very awkward position, forced to keep mum.  
但他已经知道原因：通过真嗣和美里的记忆，律子出于嫉妒和仇恨，毁掉了剩余的绫波克隆体。因此，她现在感到责任重大，在这样的聚会上，赤木律子博士处境十分尴尬，被迫保持沉默。

On the other hand, Rei was trying to figure out as to how she could voice her feelings towards Ritsuko. She was looking for the right words, the proper address, and the correct tone. Her main concern was the woman scientist's feelings towards her presence.  
另一方面，丽正在努力思考如何向律子表达她的感情。她在寻找合适的措辞、恰当的称呼和正确的语气。她主要担心的是这位女科学家对她存在的感受。

Now she made up her mind; she'll have to make it simple and direct, and so, setting aside her bowl of garlic ramen, Rei said to Ritsuko, "I have no ill will against you. I am sorry, but it is _not your fault_."  
现在她下定了决心；她必须简单直接，于是，放下手中的那碗大蒜拉面，丽对律子说：“我对你没有恶意。我很抱歉，但这不是你的错。”

Suddenly Ritsuko became the center of attention; she was flustered, caught unawares, wondering what to answer. She tried to answer but no words came out of her mouth.  
突然间，律子成了关注的焦点；她慌乱不已，猝不及防，不知道该如何回答。她试图回应，但嘴里却说不出话来。

Brows furrowed among some of the adults, unaware of what occurred at the Dummy Plug Plant. Maya, Shigeru and Makoto were staring at each other, silently making guesses, before watching the two women stare at each other, waiting for the inevitable.  
一些成年人皱起了眉头，对 Dummy Plug 工厂发生的事情一无所知。真耶、茂和诚相互对视，默默猜测着，随后看着两位女性相互凝视，等待着不可避免的爆发。

Inwardly Misato and Fuyutsuki braced for the worst, hoping that somehow Ritsuko could get a grip on herself. Shinji tensed, preparing to cover his eyes as if critical mass was about to explode right in front of him.  
美里和冬月内心做好了最坏的准备，希望丽津子能设法控制住自己。真嗣紧张起来，准备像是要在眼前发生临界爆炸一样捂住眼睛。

But Ritsuko shook her head. "No, Rei… No, I should apologize for what I did. I'm sorry, too."  
但丽津子摇了摇头。"不，丽…不，我应该为我的所作所为道歉。我也对不起。"

"It would be fine," Rei answered, nodding. "I accept your apology."  
"这样就好，" 丽回答道，点头同意。"我接受你的道歉。"

"T… Thank you." "谢…谢谢你。"

Everyone quickly made a collective sigh of relief. Misato silently applauded Ritsuko's self-restraint.  
众人迅速松了一口气。美里默默地为律子的自制力鼓掌。

"What was that?" Maya asked her boss, blinking.  
“那是什么？”玛雅问她的上司，眨了眨眼。

Ritsuko shrugged. "Can't say," she said. "I want it to be over with. I'll explain later, okay?"  
律子耸了耸肩。“说不准，”她说，“我只希望这一切快点结束。我稍后解释，好吗？”

Maya nodded.

However, Ritsuko noticed Kaworu closely for the first time, and knew why he looked so special. The dossiers on him alone couldn't do any justice.  
然而，律子第一次仔细观察了薰，明白了为什么他看起来如此特别。仅凭他的档案资料根本无法完全展现他的独特之处。

---

Asuka was scratching her head, wondering what prompted Rei to speak up. "Why the apology?" she asked while staring at the girl.  
明日香挠着头，不明白丽为何突然开口。“为什么要道歉？”她盯着女孩问道。

"I cannot tell you right here," Rei answered. "You may not like it."  
“这里不方便说，”丽回答，“你可能不会喜欢。”

Shinji nodded. "She's right."  
真嗣点头。“她说得对。”

Asuka blinked. "What?" 明日香眨了眨眼。“什么？”

Kaworu sighed and he said, "What happened down there is a very long story. We can't tell you, not until we're all alone."  
渚薰叹了口气，说道：“下面发生的事情说来话长。我们不能告诉你，除非我们单独在一起。”

"Damn," Asuka muttered. "I don't have any idea what happened while I was gone, but okay, if that's your call."  
“该死，”明日香喃喃自语，“我不知道我离开时发生了什么，但好吧，既然这是你的决定。”

"Oh, I forgot," Kaworu blurted, and he looked at Ritsuko. "So it's you, Doctor Akagi."  
“哦，我忘了，”渚薰突然说道，他看向律子，“原来是你，赤木博士。”

Ritsuko nodded. "Yes. I've been put out to the sidelines for a while, which explains why you haven't seen me, yet I heard much about you."  
律子点头。“是的。我被暂时调离了一段时间，这就是为什么你没见到我，但我听说了不少关于你的事。”

"Since when and how did you know, ma'am?"  
“您是从什么时候，又是怎么知道的呢，女士？”

"About two days ago," Ritsuko answered. "My assistant told me about you and what you were doing here."  
“大约两天前，”律子回答，“我的助手告诉我关于你的事以及你在这里所做的事情。”

Maya nodded silently in acknowledgement.  
玛雅默默地点头表示理解。

"Yes, I was meant to be a substitute for Miss Langley here," Kaworu said. "But since she made her choice, I find it okay for me to see her back into piloting Unit Two."  
“是的，我原本是作为兰格利小姐的替补来到这里，”薰说道，“但既然她做出了选择，我认为我也可以支持她重返二号机驾驶。”

Ritsuko frowned a bit. "So, what are you going to do here instead?" she asked.  
律子微微皱眉。“那么，你打算在这里做什么呢？”她问道。

"Well," Kaworu answered, "I want to try to help out in any way I can."  
"嗯，" 渚薰回答，"我想尽可能以任何方式帮忙。"

"I see. Is there anything else you wish to tell me about yourself?"  
"我明白了。你还有什么关于自己的事情想告诉我吗？"

The question was the equivalent of an unexpected curve ball, and Kaworu pondered as to what he had to say. He decided on an excuse instead.  
这个问题如同一个突如其来的曲线球，渚薰思索着自己该说些什么。他最终决定找个借口。

"Perhaps, Doctor, is it all right if we could discuss it later?" Kaworu suggested.  
“或许，博士，我们可以稍后再讨论这件事吗？”渚薰提议道。

Ritsuko sighed. "Okay, if that's what you want," she said. "Why not now?"  
律子叹了口气。“好吧，如果你坚持的话，”她说，“为什么不现在呢？”

Kaworu merely touched his forefinger to the lips. _Can't tell you._  
渚薰只是用食指轻触了一下嘴唇。不能告诉你。

Now the woman doctor turned her attention to the First Children, and asked, "Care to tell me what happened to you?"  
现在，女医生将注意力转向了初代孩子们，问道：“愿意告诉我你们发生了什么事吗？”

"I beg your pardon, Doctor?" Rei asked.  
“请再说一遍，医生？”丽问道。

"Yes, you got hurt a few days ago, and Miss Ibuki told me that Unit One rejected you again."  
“是的，你几天前受了伤，伊吹小姐告诉我，初号机再次拒绝了你。”

Rei took a breath and began to narrate about the incident at the Test Facility, as the others listened with great interest. By the time she was finished, Ritsuko remarked, "Well… Looks like she still doesn't really want you."  
丽深吸一口气，开始讲述测试设施发生的事件，其他人则饶有兴趣地听着。等她讲完，律子评论道：“嗯……看来她还是不太想要你。”

All eyes were on Rei, and she replied, "Unit One can only recognize Ikari, as I feel that she considers me as a stranger."  
所有目光都集中在丽身上，她回答说：“初号机只能识别碇，我感觉她把我当成了陌生人。”

Shinji nodded in acknowledgment, but he added, "It's not your fault, Ayanami. It's just that she's different."  
真嗣点头表示理解，但他补充说：“这不是你的错，绫波。只是她有所不同。”

"I understand that," Rei told him. "She belongs to you."  
"我明白，"丽对他说。"她属于你。"

"One thing, Rei…" Ritsuko spoke. "You said that before, you couldn't remember after Unit Zero blew up, but after Unit One rejected you… Suddenly you have your memories back. Is that true?"  
"有一点，丽…"赤木律子说道。"你之前说过，零号机爆炸后，你记不清了，但一号机拒绝你之后…突然间你的记忆又回来了。这是真的吗？"

Rei nodded. "Yes, that is true. How that happened, however, is beyond my understanding."  
丽点点头。"是的，这是真的。然而，这是如何发生的，我无法理解。"

"Thought you might want to hear out my theory," Natsumi said instead.  
"以为你可能想听听我的理论，" 夏美说道。

The others blinked. 其他人眨了眨眼。

"Okay, tell me how," Ritsuko answered.  
"好吧，告诉我，" 律子回答道。

Next thing Natsumi explained her theory of the Sixteenth Angel serving as a temporary psychic and physical conduit between Unit-00 and Unit-01 during the attack, in effect causing Unit-01 to absorb much of the memories of the other Eva and its pilot. She then told about the MRI/PET scans after the aborted test, and how Unit-01 affected Rei's brain.  
接下来，夏美解释了她关于第十六使徒在攻击期间作为临时心灵和物理媒介，使零号机和初号机之间产生联系，从而导致初号机吸收了另一台 EVA 及其驾驶员的大部分记忆的理论。她还讲述了中止测试后的 MRI/PET 扫描，以及初号机如何影响绫波的大脑。

"That's it?" Ritsuko asked afterwards.  
“就这样？”律子随后问道。

"It's plausible," Natsumi said, "but yesterday Colonel Katsuragi already asked Rei some questions about her past twice, and she was able to answer them."  
“这有可能，”夏美说，“但昨天葛城上校已经两次询问绫波关于她过去的问题，她都能回答。”

"That's right," Misato agreed.  
“没错，”美里赞同道。

Ritsuko turned her attention to Rei. "Now… What about me? Do you remember a moment with me?"  
律子将注意力转向丽。“现在……关于我呢？你还记得和我在一起的某个时刻吗？”

Rei blinked twice, as if the question suddenly made her feel naked, unable to find an answer.  
丽眨了两次眼，仿佛这个问题突然让她感到赤裸裸的，无法找到答案。

"Uh, what's wrong?" Ritsuko asked. "Something holding you back, Rei?"  
"呃，怎么了？" 律子问道。"有什么让你犹豫的吗，丽？"

"I am afraid I cannot answer them," Rei replied. "You may not like it."  
"恐怕我无法回答，" 丽回答道。"你也许不会喜欢这个答案。"

Ritsuko sighed, figuring that Rei didn't want to tell everyone about their rather difficult relationship prior to Unit Zero's destruction. "Okay, I'll not bother you this time," she said.  
律子叹了口气，猜想丽不想让大家知道她们在零号机破坏之前那段颇为复杂的关系。"好吧，这次我就不再追问了，" 她说。

Rei nodded. "Thank you, Doctor."  
丽点点头。"谢谢你，医生。"

Thousands of kilometers away, somewhere in Siberia and at SEELE's covert military base, Keel Lorenz stood on the tarmac with his retinue of bodyguards, watching as a dozen massive C-21 Dragon transport gunships began to descend on the apron, their engines and prop rotors creating a monstrous racket.  
数千公里之外，西伯利亚某处，SEELE 的秘密军事基地内，基尔·洛伦茨站在停机坪上，身边簇拥着一队保镖，注视着十几架庞大的 C-21 龙式运输武装直升机开始降落在停机坪上，它们的引擎和螺旋桨叶片制造出震耳欲聋的噪音。

The Dragons, all belonging to Global Protection Enterprises, a SEELE-owned PMC business front, were painted in "digital" low-visibility grey camouflage with RAM (radar absorbent material) coating; they were 41.5 meters long, 31.7 meters wide, and 9.22 meters high; carried four prop rotors powered by two D5 "Jimmy" turbine engines generating about 15,000 horsepower, allowing the leviathan to move forward at speeds of more than 300 knots; hardened avionics and fiber-optic "fly-by-light" flight controls; possessing the latest in composite armor to deflect or absorb enemy fire; bristling with weaponry, with point-defense Gatling gun turrets, automatic grenade launchers, 30mm autocannons, Hellfire and Maverick air-to-ground missiles, Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, and an offensive EMP burst system to destroy enemy electronics; full chaff, flare and electronic countermeasures; and finally a cargo hold large enough to carry four fully-loaded Humvees or about 200 troops.  
这些龙式直升机，全部隶属于全球保护企业，一家由 SEELE 拥有的私人军事公司业务前台，涂有“数字”低可视度灰色迷彩，并覆盖了 RAM（雷达吸收材料）涂层；它们长 41.5 米，宽 31.7 米，高 9.22 米；搭载四具由两台 D5“吉米”涡轮发动机驱动的推进旋翼，总功率约 15,000 马力，使得这巨兽能以超过 300 节的速度前进；配备加固的航空电子设备和光纤“光飞行”控制系统；拥有最新的复合装甲以反射或吸收敌方火力；武装到牙齿，包括点防御加特林炮塔、自动榴弹发射器、30 毫米自动炮、地狱火和战斧空对地导弹、响尾蛇空对空导弹，以及一套用于摧毁敌方电子设备的进攻性 EMP 脉冲系统；全面配备箔条、热焰弹和电子对抗措施；最后，还有一个足够容纳四辆满载悍马车或约 200 名士兵的大型货舱。

In a nutshell, the US$255-million Dragon was as fearsome as its namesake and in purpose: to destroy the enemy with fire.  
简而言之，这架价值 2.55 亿美元的龙式直升机如其名般令人畏惧，其目的就是用火力摧毁敌人。

Each of the Dragons extended their landing gear as they touched down, before the pilots shut off the turbines and the rotors began to wind down. Their rear ramps opened, and from there queues of heavily-armed commandoes trotted into perfect platoon-sized formations, in front of the Dragons.  
每条龙在着陆时都伸出了起落架，随后飞行员关闭涡轮，旋翼开始减速。它们的尾门打开，从那里，全副武装的突击队员列队小跑出来，迅速在龙的前方组成了完美的排级队形。

In cadence and emerging from his command Dragon, Miles Quaritch marched towards Keel and saluted, before pivoting to his troops and bellowed, drillmaster-style, "ATTENTION!"  
迈尔斯·奎尔维奇从他的指挥龙中踏步而出，向基尔走去并敬礼，然后转向他的士兵，以训练教官的口吻高声喊道：“立正！”

The crack soldiers stopped, parade attention, not moving an inch.  
这些精锐士兵立刻停下，以阅兵式的标准立正，纹丝不动。

Perfect.

Colonel Quaritch now turned back to Keel and said, "As you ordered, the troops are ready for inspection."  
夸利奇上校随即转向基尔，说道：“如您所令，部队已准备接受检阅。”

Each of the soldiers present were in full combat gear, black BDUs (battle dress uniform) and balaclava masks, and armed with the latest in weaponry. Twenty-four hundred strong, they came from all kinds of backgrounds, but in common they were military specialists, working for the money, killing if necessary on behalf of whoever can afford their fees.  
在场的每一位士兵都身着全套战斗装备，黑色战斗服（BDU）和面罩，配备着最新式的武器。他们共两千四百人，来自各种背景，但共同点是他们都是军事专家，为金钱而战，必要时为任何付得起他们费用的人执行杀戮。

Keel nodded. "Excellent," he praised.

As both men walked before the arrayed formations, trailed by the bodyguards, Quaritch said, "We have completed our full study of the Geofront complex, and I should congratulate our little inside man for providing excellent intelligence."  
两人走在列队前，身后跟着保镖，夸利奇说道：“我们已经完成了对地下都市综合体的全面研究，我得祝贺我们的小内应提供了极佳的情报。”

"Good," Keel answered in approval, making glances at the troops. "What else?"  
"很好，"基尔赞同地回答，向部队投去目光。"还有什么？"

"Everything's ready as I promised. However, we're about to face some serious resistance down there, sir."  
"正如我承诺的，一切准备就绪。不过，先生，我们即将面临那里的严重抵抗。"

"Why?" Keel asked, but then he remembered the satellite surveillance photos. "Ah… Have you known about an unusual shipment that arrived there two days ago?"  
"为什么？"基尔问，随即他想起了卫星侦察照片。"啊……你听说过两天前那里到达了一批不寻常的货物吗？"

Quaritch nodded. "Yes, sir. Sanderson informed me that it was an armaments shipment. He even sent me a complete list of the inventory."  
夸里奇点点头。“是的，长官。桑德森告诉我这是一批军火运输。他甚至给我发了一份完整的货物清单。”

Keel frowned. "So, they must have known in advance and are preparing for us."  
基尔皱眉。“这么说，他们一定是提前知道了，正在准备对付我们。”

"Damn right, and it's going to be a pisser, sir, which means that I'll need some more to bring them down."  
“该死的没错，长官，这将是一场硬仗，意味着我需要更多的火力来击垮他们。”

"Like what?"

"Double the weapons, and then some armored units. Anything to kill 'em all. Perhaps, if you allow me, I'd like to add chemical weapons to completely neutralize them."  
"双倍的武器，再加上一些装甲单位。任何能将他们赶尽杀绝的手段。或许，如果您允许的话，我想添加化学武器以彻底消灭他们。"

Keel murmured something too incoherent for Quaritch to hear, so instead the officer asked, "Yes?"  
基尔低声咕哝了些什么，奎利奇听不清楚，于是这位军官问道：“什么事？”

"Do what's necessary," Keel answered. "Forward me a list of anything you need. Money is no object in these parts, and the generals and politicians are willing to make business with us. They'll even give away a nuclear MIRV warhead if we would want it."  
"做必要的事，"基尔回答，"把你们需要的清单发给我。这里的资金不是问题，将军和政客们都愿意与我们合作。如果我们需要，他们甚至会提供一枚核弹头。"

Quaritch grinned. "I will appreciate that, sir," he said as he lit a cigar, and then he thought of something else. "Now, there's another problem: what can we do about the Japanese government?"  
夸里奇咧嘴一笑。“我会感激的，先生，”他点燃了一支雪茄，随即又想到了别的事情。“现在，还有另一个问题：我们能对日本政府做些什么？”

"Their Prime Minister is an obtuse fool, and so is his cabinet," Keel replied. "As in the past, money is the only way to make them smart so that we can pull strings. If they don't do what we say, however, we have options to motivate those bureaucrats."  
“他们的首相是个愚蠢的傻瓜，他的内阁也一样，”基尔回答。“和过去一样，金钱是唯一能让他们变得聪明的方法，这样我们才能操纵局势。不过，如果他们不听我们的，我们还有办法激励那些官僚。”

"Blackmail," Quaritch said, before pulling a drag from his Cohiba.  
"“敲诈，”夸里奇说着，从他的高希霸雪茄上吸了一口。”

"But since we don't have much time, either he'll have to cooperate with us by working with your men, or if he becomes vacillating we'll have to bring down his Self-Defense Force troops as well… and one more thing."  
“但由于时间紧迫，他要么得与我们的士兵合作，要么如果他犹豫不决，我们就不得不连他的自卫队一起拿下……还有一件事。”

"What?"

"As soon as we're done with this, let's break for lunch. To paraphrase Shakespeare, Colonel, your men must be fed with beef steaks and steel, to make them strong and deadly."  
“我们一结束这件事，就先去吃午饭。借用莎士比亚的话，上校，你的士兵得吃牛排和钢铁，才能变得强壮且致命。”

Quaritch nodded in approval. "Well, that makes sense, sir."  
夸里奇点头表示赞同。“嗯，这说得通，长官。”

"Afterwards," Keel said, "we'll meet the Russian top brass, as they'll be here in an hour." The old man then glanced at his watch and wondered if Sanderson was keeping up to his mission objective.  
“之后，”基尔说，“我们将与俄罗斯高层会面，他们一小时后就会到达。”老人随即瞥了一眼手表，思索桑德森是否能达成任务目标。

_The Second Children should be dead by now_, he pondered_._  
第二适任者现在应该已经死了，他思索着。

---

Meanwhile, back at the Cafeteria, Fuyutsuki mentioned of the gallant actions of the Cheyenne pilots, and he added, "Anyhow, your commanding officer has forwarded to me your after-action report, and recommended you two to be awarded properly."  
与此同时，在食堂那边，冬月提到了夏延飞行员们的英勇行为，并补充道：“无论如何，你们的指挥官已将你们的战后报告转交给我，并推荐你们两人应得到适当的奖励。”

"That's right, sir," Paul answered, and Trudy nodded.  
“没错，先生，”保罗回答，特鲁迪点头。

"Very well," Fuyutsuki said. "You'll receive your new ranks later this afternoon. If it weren't for your actions, Colonel Katsuragi and the Children may not make it."  
“很好，”冬月说，“你们今天下午就会收到新的军衔。如果不是因为你们的行动，葛城上校和孩子们可能就无法幸免。”

Paul and Trudy grinned in unison, and said, "Thank you, sir."  
保罗和特鲁迪同步咧嘴一笑，说道：“谢谢您，长官。”

"You're welcome," Fuyutsuki answered, and then he sighed pleasantly. He wondered what else was in the agenda… and yes, Agent Kanzaki.  
"不客气，" 冬月回答，然后愉快地叹了口气。他好奇议程上还有什么……是的，Kanzaki 特工。

"Mister Kanzaki," Fuyutsuki said.

Tsutomo blinked. "Yes?" 津友眨了眨眼。"是的？"

"You'll be given the same privilege, as a token of appreciation for your actions yesterday I'll recommend to Director Hamamoto that you'll be effectively promoted to major."  
"作为对你昨天行动的感谢，我将向滨本局长推荐，让你正式晋升为少校。"

The agent brightened up, as Natsumi nodded in approval. "Oh… Thanks, sir."  
特工脸上露出了喜色，因为夏美点头表示赞同。“哦……谢谢，先生。”

Trudy suddenly budged in and said to Tsutomo, "Well… looks like we're about to pack the O-Club tonight, huh?"  
特鲁迪突然插话进来，对津友说：“嗯……看来我们今晚要在 O-Club 热闹一番了，对吧？”

Tsutomo snapped his fingers. "Why not we pool everything together for a drink?" he suggested. "Heck, why don't we all of us go there tonight?"  
津友打了个响指。“我们何不把所有东西凑在一起喝一杯呢？”他提议道，“见鬼，我们今晚何不一起去那里呢？”

Everyone around the table voiced their approval, anywhere from a cheerful "Yes" to a nod, yet the Children, especially Shinji, wondered if they could go despite their age.  
桌边的每个人都表达了他们的赞同，从欢快的“是”到点头，然而孩子们，尤其是真嗣，却在想尽管他们年纪小，是否也能去。

"Uh…" Shinji mumbled, "What about us?"  
“呃……”真嗣咕哝着，“那我们呢？”

Misato pointed a finger at him and answered, "Well, since we had so much shared danger, why don't you kids come along?"  
美里用手指着他回答道：“既然我们共同经历了这么多危险，不如你们这些孩子也一起来吧？”

Asuka blinked. "Really?"  
明日香眨了眨眼。“真的吗？”

"You're coming, and that's an order," Misato replied and then she laughed.  
“你要来，这是命令，”美里回答，然后她笑了。

Kaworu and Rei were figuring out on themselves as to how they could fit in, and then the blue-haired girl said, "I cannot drink. I am not in the right age."  
渚和绫波正在琢磨如何融入其中，这时蓝发女孩说：“我不能喝酒。我还未到法定年龄。”

Misato blinked. "Oh, I forgot," she said. "Since you're a minor, it's okay that you can have a Shirley Temple, Rei."  
美里眨了眨眼。“哦，我忘了，”她说，“既然你还未成年，喝一杯秀兰·邓波儿是没问题的，绫波。”

"What is a 'Shirley Temple'?" Rei asked.  
“什么是‘秀兰·邓波儿’？”绫波问道。

"Basically, it's a non-alcoholic cocktail," Misato explained. "Some Sprite, grenadine and then some more, but it's not going to hurt you, really. Instead, I hope you'll love it."  
“基本上，它是一种无酒精鸡尾酒，”美里解释道，“一些雪碧，加上石榴糖浆，然后再多加一点，不过真的不会对你有任何伤害。相反，我希望你会喜欢它。”

Rei nodded in understanding. "Thank you for clarifying. I admit that I do not understand about that as well, other than being able to make and drink tea."  
丽点头表示理解。“谢谢你解释清楚。我承认除了能泡茶和喝茶之外，我对这方面也不太了解。”

Asuka smiled, as an idea came up to her noggin. "Hmmm… Hey, this sounds more like a double-date!"  
明日香微微一笑，脑海中闪过一个念头。“嗯……嘿，这听起来更像是一次双人约会！”

"What?" Shinji blurted.

Asuka leaned to Shinji and said, "It's convenient, you know? Better than going out."  
明日香向真嗣倾身说道：“这样很方便，你知道吗？比出去好多了。”

Shinji nodded. "I see… But, what I'm going to wear?"  
真嗣点点头。“我明白了……但我该穿什么呢？”

"Don't worry about the dress code," Misato reminded him. "Anything goes, as long as it's all casual."  
“别担心着装要求，”美里提醒他。“随便穿，只要是休闲装就行。”

Now Kaworu contemplated as to what Rei could wear, as he'd seen her too many times wearing that school uniform, as it was the only outdoor clothes she had.  
现在，渚薰思索着丽该穿什么，因为他见她太多次穿着那套校服了，那似乎是她唯一的户外服装。

Then, as he glanced at Asuka, he had an idea, so he gestured at the redhead and said, "Asuka, I thought if it's all right if you could do Rei a favor."  
随后，当他瞥向明日香时，灵机一动，便向红发少女示意并说道：“明日香，我在想，如果你能帮丽一个忙，是否可以？”

"Yeah?" Asuka said. “嗯？”明日香回应道。

"Since it seems that you and Rei are almost of the same size, why don't you borrow her something to wear tonight?" Kaworu queried.  
“既然你和丽身材差不多，今晚何不借她一件衣服穿呢？”渚薰提议道。

Asuka nodded. "Ah…" she said, eyeing Rei's figure in her mind, taking tape measurements until she concluded that her body size was no different as the First Children. Good.  
"明日香点了点头。“啊…”她心想，脑海中勾勒着绫波的身形，用卷尺量了又量，直到得出结论，她的身材与初号机驾驶员并无二致。很好。”

"Okay," the redhead agreed and she faced towards Rei and added, "I'll lend you some of my casuals, and... since you have little regard for the red colors, I have a spare white shirt, so I'm sure they'll fit you right."  
“好的，”红发少女同意道，转向绫波补充说，“我可以借你一些我的便服，而且…既然你对红色不太在意，我有一件备用的白衬衫，相信会很适合你。”

Rei nodded. "Thank you," she answered.  
绫波点了点头。“谢谢你，”她回答道。

Asuka smiled. "You're welcome."  
明日香微笑道：“不客气。”

While the rest ate and talked, Fuyutsuki pondered what Gendo was doing right at this very moment. Watching them perhaps, from the view of one out of several thousand surveillance cameras? Or simply passing the time by thinking of the past?  
当其他人边吃边聊时，冬月思考着此时此刻碇源堂在做什么。或许正从数千个监控摄像头中的一处观察着他们？还是仅仅在回忆过去中打发时间？

The former professor then eyed Kaworu for a while, and trying to guess about that young man's motives. Of course, Kaworu was an Angel, and yet judging from his and Misato's calm demeanor as they came back to the control room, it seems that they somehow agreed on a deal.  
这位前教授随后打量了真嗣一会儿，试图揣测这个年轻人的动机。当然，真嗣是使徒，但从他和美里回到指挥室时平静的神态来看，他们似乎达成了某种协议。

What deal?

But whatever Kaworu and Misato had discussed in between, Fuyutsuki hoped that Kaworu had enough sense not to contact Adam, and besides, he was well aware that the Fifth Children was also being watched, as he stole a glance at the overhead surveillance camera right on top of them.  
但无论渚薰和美里之间讨论了什么，冬月希望渚薰有足够的理智不去联系亚当，而且，他很清楚第五适格者也在被监视中，因为他偷瞄了一眼头顶上的监控摄像头，正好在他们上方。

On the other hand, what about the Committee, and what are they doing today? And what other plans do they have set in motion? At any rate, with the critical information that Misato gave to him, what he feared for long was steadily coming, the clock ticking away the seconds.  
另一方面，委员会今天在做什么？他们还有哪些计划正在实施？无论如何，有了美里提供的关键信息，他长期以来所担忧的事情正逐渐逼近，时间一分一秒地流逝。

Time for a judgment call, and he took a breath.  
是时候做出判断了，他深吸了一口气。

"Colonel," Fuyutsuki said. "Doctor…"  
"上校，" 冬月说。"博士…"

"Yes?" Misato asked. "什么事？" 美里问道。

"What is it, sir?" Ritsuko queried.  
"怎么了，长官？" 律子询问道。

"After we get finished with this," Fuyutsuki said, "I have something very important to discuss with you people, yet it's too sensitive."  
"等我们处理完这件事，" 冬月说，"我有件非常重要的事情要和你们讨论，但内容非常敏感。"

Ritsuko and Misato nodded, but Fuyutsuki also fingered Natsumi and Tsutomo.  
律子和美里点了点头，但冬月也示意了夏美和津友。

"You two, I also need your presence," the old man said.  
"你们两位，我也需要你们在场，" 老人说道。"

"I'll come, sir," Tsutomo answered.  
"我会来的，先生，"筒本回答道。

"It's your call, sir," Natsumi replied.  
"由您决定，先生，"夏美回应道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Good," he said. "I also need some additional input from you three, Ibuki, Aoba and Hyuga."  
冬月点了点头。"很好，"他说。"我还需要你们三位，伊吹、青叶和日向提供一些额外的意见。"

The junior officers all said, "Will do, sir."  
下级军官们齐声应道：“遵命，长官。”

Shinji blinked, wondering what the Sub-Commander had in mind. "Uh… Sir," he said. "What's going on?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，不知道副司令在打什么主意。“呃……长官，”他说，“这是怎么回事？”

Fuyutsuki sighed. "I'm sorry, son, but I'm not in liberty to tell you."  
冬月叹了口气。“对不起，孩子，但我不能告诉你。”

Shinji looked disappointed. "But…"  
真嗣看起来很失望。“但是……”

Misato shook her head. "I suggest you Children will have to make the most of your free time throughout this afternoon. There's nothing much on schedule, but I'll tell you later what else we could do, okay?"  
美里摇了摇头。“我建议你们这些孩子们今天下午要充分利用你们的自由时间。日程上没什么特别安排，但我稍后会告诉你们我们还能做些什么，好吗？”

The four Children nodded.  
四个孩子们点了点头。

Several floors up, in his office, Gendo Ikari glanced at the video monitor showing him one of the hundreds of surveillance cameras placed across the Geofront complex. At the moment, this one camera feed was located in the Cafeteria, locked onto Kaworu Nagisa's face. He could see him talking, gesturing and while eating.  
在几层楼之上的办公室里，碇源堂瞥了一眼视频监控器，上面显示着遍布地底都市综合体的数百个监控摄像头之一。此刻，这个摄像头位于食堂，锁定在渚薰的脸上。他可以看到他在说话、做手势，同时还在用餐。

He tried to imagine what this young man was thinking of, and what he was up to.  
他试图想象这个年轻人正在想什么，以及他在做什么。

Gendo, typing a few commands on the keyboard, had the camera swivel a few degrees further, the lens now focusing this time on Ritsuko Akagi.  
碇源堂敲击了几下键盘，摄像头随之转动了几度，镜头这次对准了赤木律子。

As he stared at the woman's face, his forehead furrowed, trying not to remember the moments he had with her. Instead, if in case should she does anything wrong once again, he had little qualms about taking her away for good.  
当他凝视着女人的脸庞，眉头紧锁，努力不去回忆与她共度的时光。相反，如果她再次犯错，他毫不犹豫地打算永远将她带走。

All for the plan, as long as he needed to be in total control.  
一切为了计划，只要他需要完全掌控。

Gendo sighed, and he told himself almost quietly, "I'm doing all this for you, Yui… and I regret nothing."  
源度叹了口气，几乎轻声自语道：“我这么做都是为了你，唯……我绝不后悔。”

**Author's Notes:** I confess one of my problems: lately my work as a household manager (that's a politically-correct term for my current position as a caretaker) IRL has made it difficult for me to write, and most of the time, at the end of the day I become so drained that by the time I sit down before the screen I become drowsy, almost falling asleep on the keyboard... So I should instead take a nap in the afternoon, and then have enough energy to write for about two hours a night.  
作者的话：我坦白一个困扰：近期作为家庭管理者（这是对目前看护者职位的政治正确称呼）的现实工作让我难以抽出时间写作，多数时候，一天结束时我已筋疲力尽，以至于坐在电脑前时昏昏欲睡，几乎要在键盘上打盹...所以我应该在下午小憩一会儿，然后才有足够精力每晚写上大约两个小时。

Oh well… I'm looking forward to the day when I can have a balanced life, where I call the shots, instead of the other way around.  
唉…我期待着有一天能过上平衡的生活，那时我能掌控一切，而不是反过来。

By the way, comments and criticisms are still welcome, and if you see anything wrong, drop me a line and I'll try to fix it.  
顺便说一句，评论和批评依然欢迎，如果你发现任何问题，请告诉我，我会尽力修正。

Until then, see you at the next chapter (winks).  
到时见，下次chapter再会（眨眼）。

Gendo Ikari pored over the reports concerning the current status of the Evas in the cages: after the failed compatibility test days ago, Unit-01 was completely repaired and readjusted; meanwhile Unit-02, having returned to her cage after Asuka's successful first sync test since her recovery, was currently under standard maintenance.  
碇源堂仔细研究着关于 EVA 当前状态的报告：在几天前的兼容性测试失败后，初号机已经完全修复并重新调整；与此同时，二号机在明日香康复后首次同步测试成功后返回了笼子，目前正在进行标准维护。

The bearded Commander nodded in satisfaction as he set them down on his desk, before he picked up Director Hamamoto's report, and began reading; it concerned the possible collusion between the Fifth Children and the remaining infiltrators.  
留着胡须的司令满意地点了点头，将报告放在桌上，然后拿起滨元导演的报告开始阅读；这份报告涉及第五适格者与剩余渗透者之间可能的勾结。

"Ladies and gentlemen, there's a good reason we're all here," Fuyutsuki began, using the cadence of a college lecture, and yet with a sober tone, as his subordinates under his command were all seated around the conference table.  
“女士们，先生们，我们聚集于此是有充分理由的，”冬月开始了他的讲话，用的是大学讲座的语调，但语气却十分严肃，他的下属们都围坐在会议桌旁。

Earlier, as they were leaving the Cafeteria, they thanked the two Cheyenne pilots for joining them, and then told the Children to spend the rest of the afternoon as they freely wished. Fuyutsuki then led them to this conference room down at Level B-20. Before they talked, Fuyutsuki ordered Tsutomo to do a bug sweep around the room, before the agent proclaimed the room clean enough for them to begin the meeting.  
早些时候，当他们离开餐厅时，他们向两位切延内飞行员表示感谢，感谢他们加入，然后告诉孩子们下午剩下的时间可以自由活动。之后，冬月带领他们来到了位于 B-20 层的这间会议室。在开始谈话之前，冬月命令堤摩吉对房间进行了一次窃听器扫描，直到特工宣布房间足够干净，他们才开始会议。

The former professor of Metabiology sighed, and then he continued, "Like me, some of you are very privy to the fragments of secrets that lie here in the last fifteen years; some of you aren't aware of their existence, and some of you haven't even bothered to ask, not until now. The last, of course, is because your security clearance restricts only to what you were fed with."  
这位前生物学教授叹了口气，然后继续说道：“像我一样，你们中有些人非常了解过去十五年来这里隐藏的秘密碎片；有些人则不知道它们的存在，还有一些人甚至从未费心去问，直到现在。当然，最后这种情况是因为你们的保密级别仅限于你们所接触到的信息。”

Fuyutsuki's gaze slowly wandered, looking into the faces of Misato, Ritsuko, Maya, Natsumi, Shigeru, Makoto, and Tsutomo; they were all listening, as their interest was heightened with the urgency of the increasingly dire situation they were also in.  
冬月的目光缓缓扫过，注视着美里、律子、真希波、夏美、茂、真、堤摩吉的脸庞；他们都在倾听，随着局势日益严峻，他们的兴趣也随之高涨。

"Now, I'm prepared to tell you secrets that no one, including you, knows." Fuyutsuki cleared his throat, and went on, "I apologize to say this, but in our foolish curiosity, we have opened Pandora's Box, and because of that and of one man's desire, we've put humanity at its greatest danger than any point in history. So it's essential that we must shed light to the threats we're facing at this moment."  
"现在，我准备告诉你一些秘密，这些秘密包括你在内，无人知晓。" 冬月清了清喉咙，继续说道，"我必须道歉，但出于我们愚蠢的好奇心，我们打开了潘多拉的盒子，正因为如此以及一个人的欲望，我们让人类处于历史上前所未有的最大危险之中。因此，我们必须揭示我们此刻面临的威胁，这是至关重要的。"

The old man then turned to Misato, and he requested, "First, Colonel, I would like you to explain about your inquiries regarding the Fifth Children."  
老人随后转向美里，请求道："首先，美里上校，我希望你解释一下关于第五适格者的调查。"

"So, you two are going to the library?" Kaworu asked Rei, who had Asuka by her side. They were all hanging around at the hallway, right in front of a bank of elevators while people streamed in and out of the Cafeteria.  
“所以，你们俩要去图书馆？” 渚薰问着身边的绫波，她旁边站着明日香。他们站在走廊上，就在电梯前，而人们正从食堂进进出出。

The blue-haired girl nodded, and Asuka answered, "Yeah, she's interested in reading something new, so I'll borrow a book or two there."  
蓝发女孩点点头，明日香回答道：“是啊，她想读点新书，所以我打算在那儿借一两本。”

Kaworu turned to Shinji and he suggested, "Why don't we wait down at the baths?"  
渚薰转向真嗣，提议道：“我们何不去浴池那边等呢？”

"Okay," Shinji agreed. "Is it perhaps you have something to tell me?"  
"好吧，" 真嗣同意道。"或许你有什么要告诉我的？"

"Yes," Kaworu said before both boys turned their attention to the girls and he added, "Guess we'll see you later, right?"  
"是的，" 薰说道，随后两个男孩将注意力转向女孩们，他补充道，"猜我们待会儿再见，对吧？"

"Yeah, but oh," Asuka said. "Shinji, do you have a cellphone?"  
"嗯，但是，" 明日香说。"真嗣，你有手机吗？"

Shinji nodded as he felt for the cellphone in his pocket. "Yeah, I have it just in case."  
真嗣点点头，伸手摸了摸口袋里的手机。“嗯，以防万一我带着。”

"I'll call you once we're done, okay?" Asuka said as she leaned to Shinji and kissed him lightly on the lips. "Gotta go," she added happily, before both girls walked away and entered one of the elevators. Once Asuka pressed one of the buttons and the doors closed on the girls, only then Kaworu led Shinji to another waiting elevator. He pressed the button for the ground floor, and the steel doors closed shut.  
“我们完事后给你打电话，好吗？”明日香说着，侧身靠近真嗣，轻轻在他唇上吻了一下。“得走了，”她开心地补充道，随后两个女孩一起走向电梯，进了一部。明日香按下一个按钮，电梯门在她们身后关闭。直到这时，渚薰才带着真嗣走向另一部等候的电梯。他按下通往一楼的按钮，电梯的钢门缓缓合上。

As their elevator lurched upward, Kaworu said, "I've been waiting for this chance."  
当他们的电梯开始上升时，渚薰说道：“我一直在等待这个机会。”

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, I have the same feeling… I wanted to ask a lot of questions about you."  
真嗣点点头。“嗯，我也有同样的感觉……我有很多关于你的问题想问。”

"Like what?"

"I really wanted to know why you're here, and what you're up to."  
“我真的想知道你为什么在这里，以及你在做什么。”

Kaworu nodded. "Well, it seems that you're not the only one trying to get some answers from me," he said. "Misato, Ayanami, and Asuka asked me the same questions."  
薰点点头。“嗯，看来想从我这里得到答案的不止你一个，”他说。“美里、绫波和明日香也问了我同样的问题。”

Shinji frowned. "Sorry, but I'm… No, everyone's just curious. It's because… You don't seem to talk about yourself."  
真嗣皱了皱眉。“抱歉，但我……不，大家只是好奇。是因为……你似乎不太谈论自己。”

"It's because I don't want to draw too much attention to myself. Today's an exception, however, so I'm giving you a chance." Kaworu then smiled.  
“因为我不想过多吸引注意。不过今天是个例外，所以我给你一个机会。” 渚薰随后微笑了。

"Okay," Shinji agreed, and then the elevator doors opened, along with a chime.  
“好吧，”真嗣同意了，随后电梯门打开，伴随着一声提示音。

Back at the conference room, Fuyutsuki asked Misato, "Do you have the files?"  
回到会议室，冬月问美里：“文件带来了吗？”

Misato nodded. "Yes, sir, it's with me," she said, fishing out a very small flash memory card and pulled a notebook computer close to her. She then plugged the card in and the computer read off the contents. As the computer was hooked to a projector, Misato selected the video output to that device.  
美里点头。“是的，长官，在我这儿，”她说着掏出一张非常小的闪存卡，并拉过一台笔记本电脑。她将卡插入电脑，内容随即被读取。由于电脑连接了投影仪，美里选择将视频输出到该设备上。

"Now, first of all," Misato said, "I want to make clear that ever since he arrived here, I harbored suspicions about the Fifth Children, especially his sketchy background, and so I made a personal inquiry regarding his true background. In the process, Doctor Odani discovered that, through DNA analysis…"  
“首先，”美里说，“我要明确一点，自从他来到这里，我就对第五适格者，特别是他可疑的背景，抱有怀疑。因此，我私下调查了他的真实背景。在这个过程中，小谷博士通过 DNA 分析发现……”

She then loaded a file containing the results of the DNA analysis, and added, "Kaworu Nagisa… is an Angel."  
她随后加载了一个包含 DNA 分析结果的文件，并补充道：“渚薰……是一名使徒。”

Gasps of astonishment were uttered as the projector showed the report onscreen. By merely looking at the colored lines, Kaworu's DNA sequence matched that of several Angel DNA sequences.  
当投影仪将报告展示在屏幕上时，众人发出了惊讶的吸气声。仅凭那些彩色线条，渚薰的 DNA 序列就与多个使徒的 DNA 序列相匹配。

"I'm sorry," Misato apologized, "but it's true, and as you can see, this is our proof."  
“对不起，”美里道歉说，“但这是事实，正如你们所见，这是我们的证据。”

From there, Misato and Natsumi explained to the rest about their explosive discovery.  
从那里开始，美里和夏美向其他人解释了他们的惊人发现。

As he walked with Shinji, heading towards the public baths down the near-empty hallway, Kaworu thought of the first time he was able to shake Ritsuko's hand back at the cafeteria, and he saw what was inside her soul and thoughts: on one hand she was a troubled woman, have lived a past where she was a prisoner of her mother's shadow; all her adult life was devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, with an urge to continue her mother's work, but in doing so she paid the price by surrendering her body to the Commander.  
当他和真嗣一起走在几乎空无一人的走廊上，前往公共浴室时，薰想起了第一次在食堂里能够握住律子手的那一刻，他看到了她灵魂和思想中的内容：一方面，她是一个内心困扰的女人，生活在母亲阴影下的囚徒；她的一生都致力于追求知识，迫切地想要继续母亲的工作，但在这样做的同时，她付出了代价，将自己的身体献给了司令。

In his mind's eye he saw the Commander right on top of her, and saw his bearded face in the near-dim light; could smell the sweat during copulation; felt the pain of being interfaced with an organic plug, and even the sounds of moaning.  
在他的脑海中，他看到了司令压在她身上，在昏暗的光线下看到了他留着胡须的脸；能闻到交媾时的汗水；感受到与有机插头接口的痛苦，甚至听到了呻吟声。

Kaworu blinked again, and this time she was in a holding cell, in despair, crying and cursing, wishing to die before the Commander appeared again, cold and unfeeling. Then there was the bitter exchange until the man slapped Ritsuko across the face.  
渚再次眨眼，这次她身处拘留室，绝望中哭泣咒骂，希望在指挥官再次出现之前死去，那人冷酷无情。随后是激烈的争执，直到那男人一巴掌打在律子脸上。

But then he flipped the pages of memories backwards and saw her eating breakfast with what he presumed to be her mother, unhappy and somber, and that woman told Ritsuko to be careful with men, as a cat curled around her leg.  
但随后他翻阅记忆的页面倒退，看到她与一位他推测是她母亲的人共进早餐，不开心且忧郁，那位女士告诫律子要小心男人，一只猫绕着她的腿蜷缩着。

There were other flashes of memories, of Ritsuko in high school, in a quiet classroom and seated behind her desk, her eye lazily gazing at a pretty girl with shoulder-length hair, momentarily distracted from solving an algebra problem on her quiz sheet. For a brief moment she expressed her desire by squeezing her thighs and sighed. The next thing Ritsuko was in the bathroom back at home, her fantasies running wild and focused on the same girl as she rubbed herself.  
还有其他记忆的闪现，高中时期的律子，在安静的教室里坐在课桌后，懒洋洋地看着一个肩上披着短发的漂亮女孩，暂时从解答测验卷上的代数题中分心。她短暂地通过紧夹大腿表达了自己的欲望，叹了口气。接下来律子回到了家中的浴室，她的幻想狂野而集中于同一个女孩，她摩擦着自己。

Kaworu pulled the memories around, and he went through her lifetime's worth of knowledge, all the secrets of NERV and even its predecessor, GEHIRN. Flashes of images came in succession: the MAGI and its inner workings, the Evas, the Dummy Plug Plant with its floating copies of Rei; the multitude of bioengineering papers, medical profiles, lines of programming code, coffee and cigarettes…  
渚薰将记忆一一展开，他遍历了她一生的知识，NERV 乃至其前身 GEHIRN 的所有秘密。一连串的图像接踵而至：MAGI 及其内部运作，EVA，装有漂浮的绫波复制体的模拟插入栓工厂；大量的生物工程论文，医疗档案，编程代码，咖啡与香烟……

And he saw Lilith, nailed to the cross, above a lake of LCL, waiting patiently for her time to come.  
他看到了莉莉丝，被钉在十字架上，悬浮在 LCL 湖之上，静静等待着她的时刻到来。

"Nagisa?" Shinji asked, snapping out his mind. "You look like you're zoned out again. What's wrong?"  
“渚？”真嗣问道，打断了他的思绪。“你看起来又走神了。怎么了？”

This time they were standing before the door leading to the public baths, and nobody was around. Kaworu blinked twice and he said, "I apologize if I had so many thoughts to deal with."  
这次他们站在通往公共浴室的门前，四周空无一人。渚薰眨了两次眼，说道：“如果我有许多思绪需要处理，我为此道歉。”

"I know her damn well," Colonel Miles Quaritch commented to Keel Lorenz as he looked at several pictures of Misato. Both of them were standing in a dimly-lit briefing room, before a huge flat-panel display, and at the moment, they were reviewing all the dossiers on the key figures in the NERV hierarchy.  
“我对她了如指掌，”迈尔斯·夸利提上校对基尔·洛伦兹说道，同时看着几张美里子的照片。两人站在一间昏暗的简报室里，面前是一块巨大的平板显示屏，此刻他们正在审查 NERV 高层关键人物的所有档案。

Earlier they conferred with the Russian top brass, arranging for extra military support for the upcoming invasion. Eventually they left the meeting with complete satisfaction that the Russian military were willing to help, at a surprising bargain fee of around US$3 billion dollars, which was small fry for Chairman Lorenz.  
早些时候，他们与俄罗斯高层进行了磋商，安排为即将到来的入侵提供额外的军事支持。最终，他们满意地离开了会议，确信俄罗斯军方愿意以惊人的低价——约 30 亿美元——提供帮助，这对洛伦兹主席来说不过是小菜一碟。

"When?" the old man asked as he adjusted his visor. "I hardly recall anything about you involving that woman."  
"什么时候？"老人调整着他的面罩问道，"我几乎不记得你和那个女人有什么牵扯。"

"Sir, I once used to be her combat instructor, at our training center in Stuttgart about five years ago," Quaritch recalled. "In my class, she was quite a fast learner… and had those brass balls that she could've put Demi Moore to shame," he remarked, referring to the movie _G.I. Jane_.  
"长官，我曾担任过她的战斗教练，五年前在斯图加特的训练中心，"夸里奇回忆道，"在我的班上，她学得非常快……而且有着那种胆识，足以让黛米·摩尔都自愧不如，"他提到的是电影《魔鬼女大兵》。

The Colonel then pointed out Misato's military qualifications onscreen, where she had brown-belt aikido certification, excellent marksmanship with all weapons, and advanced infantry training; despite the grueling, two-month training regimen under Quaritch's instruction, Misato eventually finished third in a platoon class of forty, the only woman among those hard men.  
上校随后在屏幕上指出了美里子的军事资质，她拥有棕带合气道认证，精通各种武器的射击，以及高级步兵训练；尽管在夸里奇指导下经历了两个月的严苛训练，美里子最终在一支由四十人组成的排级班级中名列第三，她是其中唯一的女性，与那些硬汉并肩。

"That woman is very competent," Keel said. "Ikari may be negligent in many ways, but we should not underestimate her resolve and leadership abilities."  
“那个女人非常能干，”基尔说，“碇可能在很多方面有所疏忽，但我们不应低估她的决心和领导能力。”

"Well, sir, she tried to kick my ass back then," Quaritch commented, remembering how he once defeated her on the aikido mat after three grueling rounds. "Yet I'll never know if she can win this time."  
“好吧，长官，她那时试图踢我的屁股，”夸里奇回忆道，记得自己曾在经过三场艰苦的回合后在柔道垫上击败了她，“然而我永远不知道她这次能否取胜。”

Quaritch could imagine the curves of her lithe body, hidden by the combat fatigues she wore while at training, guessing just how a woman like Misato Katsuragi could take a lot of hurting damage and yet keep on ticking, even laughing and singing video karaoke while holding an impossibly huge mug of beer at the local tavern; must be her past experience of surviving Second Impact, and so close to Ground Zero. That alone was enough to add some more brick behind that woman's sexy veneer.  
"夸里奇能想象到她穿着训练服时隐藏的苗条身姿，猜测像赤木律子这样的女人如何承受大量伤害却依然坚持，甚至在当地的酒馆里拿着一个巨大无比的啤酒杯边笑边唱卡拉 OK；这一定是她经历过第二次冲击并接近震中地带的过去经验。仅此一点就足以在那位性感女士的外表下增添更多坚韧的砖石。”

"It's too bad that sooner or later once we meet again, I'll have to kill her," he remarked.  
"真可惜，迟早有一天我们再见面时，我得杀了她，" 他评论道。

"Any regrets?" Keel asked.  
"有遗憾吗？" 基尔问。

"No, sir," Quaritch said, shaking his head. "Absolutely not. Like most of my dealings, or my affairs with women, it's all business as far as I'm concerned."  
"没有，长官，" 夸里奇说，摇了摇头。"绝对没有。就像我大部分的交易，或是与女人的关系，对我来说都是纯粹的生意。

With the spa all to themselves, both boys disrobed, a meter away from each other, as they stored their clothes into lockers. Shinji was trying not to get too much of an eyeful of his body, but Kaworu was perfect with every inch of alabaster-hued, blemish-free skin, like a living sculpture of some young Greek god. Oddly enough, he had no body hair whatsoever, while Shinji was growing a bit of such hair at this developing age.  
两人独享着温泉，相隔一米宽衣解带，将衣物存入储物柜。真嗣尽量不去过多打量自己的身体，但渚薰每一寸肌肤都完美无瑕，宛如一尊年轻希腊神祇的活雕像，白皙无瑕。奇怪的是，他身上没有一丝体毛，而真嗣在这个成长阶段已经开始长出一些体毛了。

He hoped not to have too much facial hair, so as soon as he could see the first stubble on his chin he will have to shave it off _immediately_; he hated the terrifying idea of waking up one day to find himself staring back at his father in the mirror.  
他希望不要长太多胡须，一旦看到下巴上冒出第一根胡茬，就得立刻刮掉；他讨厌那种可怕的想法，担心有一天醒来，会在镜中看到自己变成了父亲的样子。

Kaworu noticed the other boy's glance. "What's wrong?" he asked.  
渚薰注意到对方的目光。"怎么了？"他问道。

Shinji blinked. "No… Nothing," he stammered, blushing as he turned away.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“不……没什么。”他结巴着，脸红地转过身去。

"Anyway, since you're a bit shy, why don't you go first?" Kaworu suggested.  
“话说回来，既然你有点害羞，不如你先来？”薰提议道。

"Okay," Shinji agreed as he walked out of the dressing room towards the washing section. Once there he sat down on a stool, took a ladle of the warm water and splashed it over his body, a surprisingly comfortable sensation.  
“好的。”真嗣同意了，他走出更衣室，朝洗浴区走去。一到那里，他便坐在凳子上，舀起一勺温水，泼洒在身上，一种出乎意料的舒适感油然而生。

Then Kaworu came out and sat on another stool and did the same ritual. As he washed himself he remarked, "I'm glad that finally I get to talk to you in this way."  
随后，渚薰走了出来，坐在另一个凳子上，重复了同样的仪式。当他清洗自己时，他感慨道：“我很高兴终于能以这种方式与你交谈。”

"Why?"

"I have a lot of things I want to say, things I want to get off my chest. Besides, I wanted to make sure we're just the two of us in here."  
“我有很多话想说，有些事情我想倾诉出来。而且，我想确保这里只有我们两个人。”

Shinji nodded as he put away the ladle. "Me too. Been waiting to talk to you, and I'm anxious to ask."  
真嗣点点头，放下勺子。“我也是。一直在等你，有些问题我急于询问。”

"I see," Kaworu understood as he waded down into the warm pool of water. Shinji followed suit, yet with a small towel covering his family jewels. He sighed in pleasure, as the water was real comfortably warm. He was sure it would also take away some of his frustrations.  
"我明白了，" 渚薰一边说着，一边走进温暖的池水中。真嗣也跟着下去，不过用一条小毛巾遮住了他的私密部位。他满足地叹了口气，因为这水真的很温暖舒适。他确信这也能缓解一些他的烦恼。

Shinji asked, "Now, where were you yesterday while we were stuck in trouble?"  
真嗣问道："那么，昨天我们陷入困境时，你在哪里？"

Kaworu submerged himself a bit into the water for a moment, and then he ran a hand over his hair, water dripping away. "I was with Rei in her flat as she invited me for tea. Had some quiet time."  
渚薰在水中稍微潜入了一会儿，然后用手梳理了一下头发，水珠随之滴落。"我在绫波的公寓里，她邀请我去喝茶。享受了一段宁静的时光。"

"Oh, that's true?" Shinji asked.  
"哦，真的吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Yes. Really got to know each other."  
"是的。真的要互相了解。"

Shinji chuckled. "Sounds more like a date."  
真嗣轻笑。"听起来更像是一次约会。"

"I don't know, but perhaps close enough to what Asuka told me," Kaworu admitted.  
"我不知道，但或许接近明日香告诉我的那样，"渚薰承认道。

"Ah, she explained to you what a date is?"  
"啊，她向你解释了什么是约会吗？"

"Yes, after I confessed to her that I don't understand about it," Kaworu said. "Oh, can you tell me again what happened yesterday?"  
"是的，在我向她坦白我不懂这些之后，"渚薰说。"哦，你能再告诉我一遍昨天发生了什么吗？"

"Okay," Shinji said before he narrated his version of yesterday's events on the road through hell. The ambush, and then the shootout and the chase, before the gunships swooped down and finished the baddies.  
“好吧，”真嗣说道，接着叙述了他对昨天地狱之路事件的版本。伏击，然后是枪战和追逐，直到武装直升机俯冲下来，终结了那些坏蛋。

"…and because Asuka was angry at me," Shinji continued, "I had no choice except to shoot; I got real angry. But deep inside, I felt guilty about killing people."  
“…而且因为明日香对我生气了，”真嗣继续说，“我别无选择，只能开枪；我真的很生气。但在内心深处，我对杀人感到内疚。

"Why?" Kaworu asked. “为什么？”渚薰问道。

"I… I'm afraid of someone looking me down and say that I am a murderer. Do you think I was doing right? I don't know, but I had to fight and I don't want to see Asuka or Misato hurt or… even killed."  
"我…我害怕有人会看不起我，说我是个杀人犯。你觉得我做得对吗？我不知道，但我必须战斗，我不想看到明日香或美里受伤，甚至被杀。"

"Does this dilemma trouble you so much? It's always human nature to deal with the dangers of his environment or his fellow man, and such situations cannot be avoided altogether."  
"这个困境让你如此困扰吗？人类总是要面对来自环境或同伴的危险，这样的情形无法完全避免。"

"How so?"

"Human history is mostly shaped through violence, for a lot of reasons. Some wanted change, others wanted to erase an ugly blemish, and still there are some who use violence as an excuse. In your case, it's a matter of survival, and who gets to win in the end because you are probably mindful of the lives of those closest to you. In danger and in fear, it becomes imperative to let go of moral questions over the use of drastic measures, especially the use of violence."  
"人类历史大多是由暴力塑造的，原因有很多。有些人渴望改变，有些人想抹去丑陋的污点，还有一些人则以暴力为借口。对你而言，这是关乎生存的问题，以及最终谁会胜出，因为你很可能在乎那些最亲近的人的生命。在危险和恐惧中，放弃对极端手段，尤其是暴力的道德质疑变得至关重要。"

"So you think I was right?"  
"所以你认为我是对的？"

"Yes and no. No because killing is an offense defined in many religions, going against the grain of goodness and ethics, a regression to ancient instinct of fear. On the other hand, it's a yes because you need to defend what you value, and for the sake of your survival. In a way, it's a double-edged sword."  
"是也不是。不是因为杀戮在很多宗教中被视为罪行，违背了善良与道德的准则，是一种退回到古老恐惧本能的行为。另一方面，说是对的，是因为你需要捍卫你所珍视的东西，为了生存。从某种角度看，这是一把双刃剑。"

Shinji sighed. "Strangely, afterwards I had little guilt about it," he said. "We didn't even mention during last night's dinner, as if it was perfectly normal. It's all because Asuka told me why I should not feel guilty, and she thought I was like an army recruit on his first battle."  
真嗣叹了口气。“奇怪的是，事后我对此几乎没有罪恶感，”他说。“昨晚的晚餐上我们甚至没有提及此事，仿佛一切都很正常。这都是因为明日香告诉我为什么我不应该感到内疚，她认为我就像一个初次上战场的士兵。”

"I see," Kaworu agreed.  
"我明白了，"渚薰同意道。

"Well, isn't it true that someone said that violence can only be used as a last resort?" Shinji questioned.  
"嗯，不是有人说暴力只能作为最后的手段吗？"真嗣质疑道。

"That could be right. I believe it's only used when negotiations or pleads for peace fail. Considering history, some people do not want to go that way because of fear."  
"可能是对的。我认为只有在谈判或和平请求失败时才会使用。考虑到历史，有些人因为恐惧而不愿意走这条路。"

Shinji nodded. "So in that case, I think I did the right thing, as I had no choice in the matter, and also I had to live with the decisions I make."  
真嗣点点头。“所以在那种情况下，我认为我做了正确的事，因为我别无选择，而且我也必须承担我所做决定带来的后果。”

"But still… Regarding fear, I'm still concerned about how do you behave, and how do you get along with people."  
“但即便如此……关于恐惧，我仍然担心你如何表现，以及你如何与人相处。”

Shinji suddenly frowned. "I'm doing well now; I've settled my problems with Asuka, Ayanami and Misato, and even you, but you think is there still a problem with me?"  
真嗣突然皱起眉头。“我现在做得很好；我和明日香、绫波、美里都解决了问题，甚至和你也是，但你觉得我还有什么问题吗？”

"Let me tell you this," Kaworu said. "Back before I came here, you go to such extremes to avoid first contact. Are you afraid of connecting with other people?"  
"让我告诉你一件事，"渚薰说。"在我来这里之前，你为了避开初次接触而走到了如此极端的地步。你害怕与他人建立联系吗？"

"I don't know… But I'm doing the right thing," Shinji answered.  
"我不知道……但我觉得我做得对，"真嗣回答道。"

"If you don't get close to others," Kaworu spoke, "you'll never be betrayed and you'll never hurt everybody else. But it'll be hard for you to forget loneliness. Humans can never banish their loneliness completely, because being human means being alone. But humans are able to go on with their lives because they're able to forget it every so often. Can you imagine that?"  
"如果你不接近他人，"渚薰说道，"你永远不会被背叛，也不会伤害到其他人。但你会很难忘记孤独。人类永远无法彻底消除孤独感，因为作为人就意味着孤独。但人类能够继续生活，是因为他们能够时不时地忘记孤独。你能想象那种感觉吗？"

Images flashed before Shinji's mind, matching a face with each sentence; his father, Rei, Asuka and Misato. Betrayal. Loneliness. Pain. Sorrow.  
图像在真嗣的脑海中闪现，每一句话都对应着一张面孔；他的父亲、绫波、明日香和美里。背叛。孤独。痛苦。悲伤。

"The people I love sometimes need me the most," Shinji said. "I don't want to spend too much time being alone. I've changed, and so are the others."  
“我爱的人有时最需要我，”真嗣说。“我不想花太多时间独自一人。我已经改变了，其他人也一样。”

Kaworu shook his head. "You're still vulnerable, Shinji. There's something inside you that could give way to weakness and pain, and therefore you feel as if you're suffering under duress, and you cower away from an insult. Fear is also your worst enemy, and it could blind you."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“你仍然脆弱，真嗣。你内心有些东西可能会导致软弱和痛苦，因此你感觉自己像是在胁迫下受苦，对侮辱退避三舍。恐惧也是你最大的敌人，它可能会蒙蔽你。”

Shinji said nothing, having no more to answer.  
真嗣一言不发，无话可答。

"I have to admit to you that, honestly, because you're so alone, and since I first came here I became concerned about your plight, more so considering that everyone here has placed their hopes upon you. I really care about you as if you're my younger brother."  
“我必须向你坦白，老实说，因为你如此孤独，自从我来到这里，我就开始关心你的困境，更不用说这里的每个人都把希望寄托在你身上。我真的像对待弟弟一样关心你。”

"Why it has to be me?" Shinji asked, blinking. "You call me a 'younger brother'?"  
“为什么非得是我？”真嗣眨着眼问，“你称我为‘弟弟’？”

Kaworu smiled. "In a way, yes, it's true. I was hoping that you could at least understand what others think of you, and maybe some of them try to help you out, including me and your friends. You're doing right, but I was wondering how long you could keep it that way."  
渚薰微笑道：“某种程度上，确实如此。我希望你至少能理解别人对你的看法，也许他们中的一些人会试图帮助你，包括我和你的朋友们。你做得对，但我好奇你能坚持多久。”

"I don't want to go back to where I used to be," Shinji answered. "I don't want to be like my father."  
“我不想回到过去，”真嗣回答，“我不想变得像我父亲那样。”

Kaworu sighed, pondering. "There's something else I wanted to ask," he said. "You may not like it but I ask you this: what would you do if you were betrayed? Or someone lied against you? What would you do?"  
渚薰叹了口气，沉思着说：“还有件事我想问，”他说，“你可能不喜欢，但我还是要问：如果你被背叛了，或者有人对你撒谎，你会怎么做？”

Shinji had a double-take. "I… I don't know. Maybe it depends on who's betraying or lying at me."  
真嗣愣了一下。“我……我不知道。可能取决于谁在背叛或对我撒谎吧。”

"But then, what if the betrayal or the lie is severe, so severe that it would even cost a life or many lives?" Kaworu questioned.  
“但如果是严重的背叛或谎言，严重到甚至会危及生命或许多生命呢？”渚薰问道。

Shinji hung his head, trying to think before he said what he thought was the best answer. "I guess… I think I would get back at the liar or the traitor, because he's responsible for making me do what I don't want to do."  
真嗣低下头，努力思考后说出了他认为最好的答案。“我想……我会报复那个撒谎者或叛徒，因为他要为让我做我不想做的事负责。”

"And what if it's too late?"  
"但如果已经太迟了呢？"

The Third Children clenched his teeth, apparently frustrated and uncomfortable. "I'll blame myself for believing in the lie," he replied. "I would feel responsible for that mistake."  
第三适格者咬紧牙关，显然感到沮丧和不适。“我会责怪自己相信了这个谎言，”他回答道，“我会为那个错误感到自责。”

_This is_ _far enough,_ Kaworu thought, concerned with Shinji's growing discomfort. "Okay," he said. "I'm giving you a reprieve."  
卡洛觉得这已经足够了，担心真嗣越来越不舒服。“好吧，”他说，“我给你一个喘息的机会。”

Shinji blinked. "What?"

"I think you're too tired to guess what better you could do to make your own life decisions," Kaworu answered. "I'm asking such questions because, who knows when the time comes someone could wrong you, and you would have to try to decide how best to deal with such situations. You've got to be strong, but think about it."  
"我想你太累了，猜不出还有什么更好的办法来自己做决定，" 渚薰回答道。"我问这些问题是因为，谁知道什么时候会有人对你不利，而你必须设法决定如何最好地应对这种情况。你必须坚强，但也要好好想想。"

"My father betrayed me," Shinji admitted, looking angry.  
"我父亲背叛了我，" 真嗣承认道，看起来很生气。"

"Why?"

"He lied!" Shinji exclaimed. "I was asked to come here, and I thought my father wanted me this time… after all those years we were apart. I thought I could just watch, be at the sidelines, and I thought he could be a good father just as I hoped him to be. But, no, he wanted me to pilot Eva; he never told me why, but just ride in and kill that Angel! At the time I couldn't understand completely that by the time I was done killing, I was mad at him for lying that I had to run away, run away from everyone here. I didn't want it then, I hated the experience… and I saw what was behind Unit One's face; I felt responsible for someone's pain, I was angry and ashamed at myself."  
"他撒谎了！" 真嗣喊道。"我被叫到这里来，我以为这次我父亲想要我……毕竟我们分开了那么多年。我以为我可以旁观，站在一边，我以为他可以像我希望的那样成为一个好父亲。但是，不，他想要我驾驶 Eva；他从未告诉我为什么，只是让我骑上去杀死那个使徒！那时我无法完全理解，直到我杀完之后，我因为他的谎言而对他生气，不得不逃离这里，逃离这里的每一个人。那时我不想要这些，我讨厌这段经历……我看到了初号机背后的真相；我感到对某人的痛苦负有责任，我对自己感到愤怒和羞愧。"

Shinji took a breath. "But then, I couldn't escape; there was no other place to go, and so I returned. Why? After I rescued them from trouble, two of my pals understood what I was going through, saw what I'm truly am, and why I was crying right in the plug."  
真嗣深吸了一口气。“但那时，我无处可逃；没有其他地方可去，所以我回来了。为什么？在我从困境中救出他们之后，我的两个朋友理解了我的处境，看到了我真正的样子，以及我为何在插入栓里哭泣。”

He saw Misato in his mind. "And her, Misato. Perhaps she's the only one I think was family for me. Close to home, yet better than having nothing at all. I saw her true self, and perhaps she saw what I am, and we understood. Same thing with Asuka just yesterday; saw beyond her façade, saw what she went through…"  
他脑海中浮现出美里。“还有她，美里。也许我认为她是我唯一的家人。虽然离家近，但总比一无所有要好。我看到了她的真实面目，也许她也看到了我的，我们彼此理解。昨天和明日香也是一样；看穿了她的伪装，看到了她的经历……”

The Third Children glanced up at the painted depiction of Mount Fuji on the wall before them. "Now if only… If only Father could just snap out of his damn selfishness a long time ago, then my life would've been different; I wouldn't have to be living a lie, watching innocent people hurt or die. But he can't change. Never."  
第三适格者抬头看着他们面前墙上描绘的富士山画作。“现在要是……要是父亲能早点摆脱他的自私就好了，那样我的生活就会不同；我就不必生活在谎言中，看着无辜的人受伤或死去。但他无法改变。永远不会。”

Kaworu pondered on much of Shinji's admission, and then said, "So what are you going to do with such a difficult situation?"  
渚薰沉思着真嗣的坦白，然后问道：“那么，面对如此棘手的局面，你打算怎么办？”

Shinji sighed and he shook his head. "I'll have to live with it, I suppose. Do my best to survive, whether my father cares about me or not. I'm doing it for the people I truly cherish because the true friends I have are the ones who gave me a side of themselves, and they, in turn, saw a side of me."  
真嗣叹了口气，摇了摇头。“我想我只能接受它，尽力生存下去，无论我父亲是否在乎我。我这样做是为了我真正珍视的人，因为我真正的朋友给了我他们的一面，而他们也看到了我的一面。”

"Does that mean there are no lies?"  
“这是否意味着没有谎言？”

"No. Me, Misato, Asuka… Ayanami. I think we have finally understood each other, and so I trust them."  
"不，我、美里、明日香……绫波。我想我们终于理解了彼此，所以我信任她们。"

In the library, Asuka and Rei were walking through several aisles of shelves, looking for the book she wanted to show. The library, with more than 10 kilometers of shelving, filled mostly of scientific and research material necessary for NERV, but it also had other general interest articles, including fiction for entertainment, to reflect the organization's self-sufficiency. Indeed, two aisles had its stock of paperback fiction; another had at least three shelves of manga. At the moment, this section was filled with off-duty personnel browsing through the publications, at least two young men almost loudly debating the merits of the latest issue of _Naruto_, and the girls had to nudge through, whispering excuses.  
在图书馆里，明日香和绫波穿过几排书架，寻找她想展示的那本书。图书馆拥有超过 10 公里的书架，主要存放着 NERV 所需的科学研究资料，但也收藏了其他一般兴趣的文章，包括娱乐用的小说，以体现组织的自给自足。实际上，有两排书架专门存放平装小说；另一排则至少有三层漫画。此刻，这一区域挤满了正在浏览出版物的非值班人员，至少有两名年轻男子在激烈讨论最新一期的《火影忍者》，女孩们不得不挤过去，低声道歉。

"Ah, here it is," Asuka finally said as she pulled the hardbound book away from the shelf, and handed it over to Rei. The blue-haired girl stared at the cover, blinking as she read the kanji on it, as it was the Japanese version of the novel:  
"啊，找到了，"明日香终于说道，她从书架上抽出那本硬皮书，递给了绫波。蓝发女孩盯着封面，眨眼间读着上面的汉字，这是那本小说的日文版：

_Twilight –_ _by Stephenie Meyer_  
暮光之城 – 斯蒂芬妮·梅尔 著

"What do you think?" the redhead asked almost quietly.  
“你觉得怎么样？”红发女孩几乎轻声问道。

"It looks… interesting," Rei said.  
“看起来……挺有意思的，”丽说。

Asuka grinned. "Heck, it'll be a lot more interesting once you read it. Know why?"  
明日香咧嘴一笑。“见鬼，等你读了它，会更有趣的。知道为什么吗？”

"Why?"

"Well, you and Kaworu are no different from the characters in that story," Asuka said. "I saw parallels, and I thought you're a bit like Bella because you have little idea about Kaworu."  
“嗯，你和渚薰跟那故事里的角色没什么两样，”明日香说，“我看到了相似之处，我觉得你有点像贝拉，因为你对渚薰几乎一无所知。”

Rei couldn't say anything, as she held on to her and Kaworu's promise to keep his true identity a secret.  
绫波无法回答，因为她坚守着与渚薰的承诺，对他的真实身份保密。

"Who is Bella?" Rei asked.  
“贝拉是谁？” 丽问道。

"She's the heroine," Asuka answered. "And, oh, the hero's Edward Cullen, but I can't tell you much about what he is; I don't want to spoil you the details, you know, not until you read."  
“她是女主角，” 明日香回答。“而男主角是爱德华·卡伦，但我不能告诉你太多关于他的信息；我不想剧透，你知道的，除非你读过。”

Rei blinked, quite unsure. "Is this Edward the same as Nagisa?"  
丽眨了眨眼，颇为不确定。“这个爱德华和渚是同一个人吗？”

"He's a mystery," Asuka answered.  
"他是个谜," 明日香回答道。

"Why?"

"Because he doesn't tell much about himself."  
"因为他不怎么谈论自己。"

"I do not want to ask him either," Rei replied. "I prefer to respect his wishes."  
"我也不想问他," 绫波回答。"我更愿意尊重他的意愿。"

"Thought I would like you to answer this," Asuka said, before she sighed. "Tell me, do you really love him?"  
"本以为你会愿意回答这个问题，" 明日香说道，随即叹了口气。"告诉我，你真的爱他吗？"

"Who?" Rei questioned, "Is it Ikari or Nagisa?"  
"谁？" 绫波反问道，"是碇还是渚？"

"Kaworu," Asuka corrected her.  
"薰，" 明日香纠正她。

Rei sighed, nodding softly. "Yes, I do."  
丽叹了口气，轻轻点头。“是的，我有。”

"I know, but how _much_ do you love him?"  
“我知道，但你有多爱他？”

This time Rei tried to find the words to describe her thoughts, and she said, "I am lonely. I have nothing. I do not have anything except my purpose, which is to serve as a pilot… But that was before he came into my life. I love him now because he helped me when I had none, when I was weak, and when I thought I was only expendable."  
这一次，丽试图找到描述她想法的词语，她说：“我很孤独。我一无所有。除了作为驾驶员的使命，我什么都没有……但在他进入我的生活之前。我现在爱他，因为他在我一无所有、脆弱无助、认为自己只是可有可无的时候帮助了我。”

"Expendable?" "可牺牲的？"

"I do not want to be expendable," Rei continued. "Through Nagisa, I found my self-worth and I realize the meaning of my life, and how I should live it."  
"我不想成为可牺牲的，" 丽继续说道。"通过渚，我找到了自我价值，我明白了生活的意义，以及我应该如何生活。"

The redhead sighed. "Just a little like me."  
红发人叹了口气。"只是有点像我。"

"I beg your pardon?"  
"请再说一遍？"

"Kaworu told me why I should value my life, and he was right. It ain't living if I were to keep on building the walls around me, which is why I'm this open today. So I wondered how long your relationship with Kaworu could last."  
"渚薰告诉我为什么我应该珍惜生命，他说得对。如果我一直筑墙自闭，那就不是真正的生活，这也是我今天如此坦诚的原因。所以我好奇，你和渚薰的关系能持续多久。"

"I hope it should last as long as we live," Rei answered.  
""我希望只要我们活着，这段关系就能持续下去。"" 绫波回答道。

Asuka smiled. "Yeah, it should be, and you're really lucky it's your very first."  
明日香笑了。“是啊，应该是这样，而且你真的很幸运，这是你的第一次。”

"But… There is a problem."  
“但是……有一个问题。”

The redhead blinked. "Why, what's wrong?"  
红发女孩眨了眨眼。“为什么，有什么问题吗？”

Rei looked doubtful this time, as she held the book to her bosom. "I am very much afraid for what would happen to him at any time soon. I also fear for his life."  
这次，丽看起来颇为疑虑，她将书紧抱在胸前。“我很担心他随时可能遭遇不测。我也担心他的生命安全。”

Asuka frowned. "How… No, why?"  
明日香皱起眉头。“怎么……不，为什么？”

The blue-haired girl's head bowed in commiseration. "Like me, he is also a servant, but… expendable."  
蓝发女孩低头表示同情。“和我一样，他也是个仆人，但是……可有可无。”

"…and that's how his sequence matched up," Natsumi said, concluding her presentation of their investigation on Kaworu Nagisa. It took ten minutes to explain how Kaworu's DNA had the components of a signature Angel DNA structure, by matching the bases to another.  
“……就这样，他的序列匹配上了，”夏美说道，结束了关于渚薰的调查报告。她花了十分钟解释渚薰的 DNA 如何具有天使 DNA 结构的特征，通过将碱基与另一个样本匹配。

"Any questions?" Misato asked.  
“有什么问题吗？”美里问道。

Ritsuko showed an upraised finger. "Yes, Odani… Tell me, how did you manage to get a hold of his DNA?"  
律子举起一根手指。“是的，小谷……告诉我，你是怎么拿到他的 DNA 的？”

"Because his blood sample was insufficient," Natsumi replied, "I decided to sneak into his room, took a lock of that boy's hair and did a more thorough analysis."  
"因为他的血液样本不足，" 夏美回答，"我决定潜入他的房间，取了一缕那孩子的头发，进行了更彻底的分析。"

"I see," Ritsuko agreed. "Any possible impurities?"  
"我明白了，" 律子同意道。"有没有可能的杂质？"

Natsumi shook her head. "No, absolutely not. This was a pure sample, and I handled it using standard procedures."  
夏美摇了摇头。"没有，绝对没有。这是一个纯净的样本，我使用的是标准操作程序。"

"What are we going to do with him, then?" Maya asked.  
"那我们该怎么处理他呢？" 真希问道。

"He agreed to me not to make contact with Adam," Misato answered. "I think he would keep his promise as long as nothing bad happens to Rei. However, should he break his promise, we'll have no choice except to use Eva against him."  
"他答应过我不会与亚当接触，" 美里回答。"我认为只要丽没有遭遇不测，他会遵守承诺的。但如果他违背诺言，我们别无选择，只能动用 EVA 来对付他。"

"Wait a minute… What does the First Children has to do with him?" Makoto asked.  
"等一下……第一适格者和他有什么关系？" 诚问道。

"You may find this unusual, but they're in love," Misato answered.  
“这可能听起来不寻常，但他们确实相爱了。”美里回答道。

"What?" Maya blurted.

Misato shook her head. "I'd like to explain how they hit it off, but it's a long story."  
美里摇了摇头。“我想解释他们是如何走到一起的，但这是个很长的故事。”

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat, as if it was a signal that it was his turn to take the stage. "Now that our suspicions about this boy have been put to rest," he said, "we have another issue with his employers; they've sent him here to test us…"  
冬月清了清嗓子，仿佛是一个信号，示意轮到他发言了。“既然我们对这个男孩的疑虑已经消除，”他说，“我们还有另一个问题，他的雇主派他来考验我们……”

"To see if we're vulnerable," Tsutomo added.  
"看看我们是否容易受到攻击，" 筒本补充道。

"I'm afraid you're correct, Captain," Fuyutsuki said. "Although we don't know for sure how they persuaded him to follow their orders, it's clear that they have hostile intent against us because, I'm sorry to say, our Commander has deviated from their plans, and Kaworu Nagisa is their supposed debt collector."  
"恐怕您说得没错，队长，" 冬月说。"虽然我们不确定他们是如何说服他服从命令的，但很明显，他们对我们怀有敌意，因为很遗憾地说，我们的指挥官偏离了他们的计划，而碇真嗣是他们所谓的债务追讨者。"

"Why?" Shigeru asked. "为什么？" 四郎问道。

Fuyutsuki shook his head. "In the execution of the Human Instrumentality Project, his plan is different from theirs… So now is the right time that in order to prepare you all, I must explain the true purpose of Instrumentality."  
冬月摇了摇头。“在执行人类补完计划的过程中，他的计划与他们的不同……所以现在正是时候，为了让大家做好准备，我必须解释补完计划的真正目的。”

Both of them still in the water, after a few minutes of silence Shinji felt it was his turn to change the subject and ask, wanting to know more. "I haven't asked you this, but it seems that all the while you were here, why don't you tell me who you really are?"  
两人仍泡在水中，沉默了几分钟后，真嗣觉得该轮到自己转换话题并提问了，他想了解更多。“我还没问过你这个，但既然你一直在这里，为什么不告诉我你到底是谁？”

"Why?" Kaworu asked. “为什么？”渚薰问道。

"You seem to know me so much, even know the two girls, and yet… I don't understand why you can't tell me who and what you are. Even where you came makes me wonder about it. Are you hiding something from me?"  
"你似乎对我了如指掌，连那两个女孩也知道，然而……我不明白你为何不能告诉我你是谁，是什么身份。甚至连你来自哪里都让我感到疑惑。你是不是对我隐瞒了什么？"

"Well…" Kaworu shook his head. "I can't tell you too much, really."  
"嗯……" Kaworu 摇了摇头。"我真的不能告诉你太多。"

"What's the big deal?"  
"这有什么大不了的？"

Kaworu shook his head. "All I know is that I was an orphan, but adopted by a professor and he took care of me. I lived a sheltered life, and then he told me that I was chosen and must pilot an Eva.  
渚薰摇了摇头。“我所知道的是，我曾是个孤儿，但被一位教授收养，他照顾了我。我过着与世隔绝的生活，直到他告诉我，我被选中必须驾驶 Eva。”

"For most of my life, I lived alone with him and he's the only one around whom I could talk to. When the day came I was to be assigned here, that's when it was time to experience something new. I wanted to find new friends, more people to talk with. I want to feel something more, understand and discover.  
“在我生命的大部分时间里，我与他独自生活，他是我唯一能与之交谈的人。当那一天到来，我被分配到这里时，就是体验新事物的时刻了。我想结交新朋友，与更多的人交流。我想要感受更多，理解并探索。”

"Now… since you seem to be suspicious about me, let me tell you: I came here to help in good faith, not just as a pilot as if I wanted to prove something in that part, and that's not what I aspire for."  
“现在……既然你似乎对我有所怀疑，让我告诉你：我来这里是真心诚意地提供帮助，不仅仅作为一个飞行员，好像我要在那方面证明什么，那不是我所追求的。”

Kaworu sighed. "You know, I realize that after all those days of being here, there's meaning for me, a purpose, almost just the same way as you do."  
渚薰叹了口气。“你知道吗，经历了这么多天在这里的日子，我意识到对我来说，这里有着意义，一个目的，几乎和你一样。”

"What's that?" Shinji wondered.  
“那是什么？” 真嗣好奇地问。

"Oddly, I felt as if I was born and destined to meet you."  
“奇怪的是，我感觉自己仿佛生来就是为了遇见你。”

"Speaking of being here," Shinji said, "Before, I used to enjoy myself peacefully with my uncle and aunt. Nothing eventful, just ordinary days, so I had little to do except to exist; I thought it to be fine for me."  
"说到这里，" 真嗣说道，"以前，我和叔叔婶婶一起平静地生活，日子平淡无奇，除了存在之外没什么可做的；我觉得这样对我来说挺好的。

"So, in a sense, you wanted to be lonely?"  
"这么说来，你某种程度上是想孤独吗？"

Shinji shrugged. "I don't know, but you came here and changed things. You taught me to see things in a different light, and I'm still trying. Yet some things don't change for me."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。"我不知道，但你来到这里改变了这一切。你教会了我从不同的角度看问题，我还在努力适应。然而有些事情对我来说并没有改变。

"Like what?"

"I'm still angry at my father for putting me in here in the first place, but considering Asuka and Misato, and maybe Ayanami, I thought otherwise because I didn't want to leave them behind. It's only my father who let me down."  
"我仍然对我父亲一开始就把我送到这里感到愤怒，但考虑到明日香和美里，还有可能包括绫波，我改变了想法，因为我不想离开他们。只有我父亲让我失望了。"

The Third Children suddenly blinked. _Why I'm talking about this to him?_  
第三适格者突然眨了眨眼。我为什么要跟他说这些？

"Strange," Kaworu muttered, thinking of Rei. "You believe that your father's close to Ayanami, right?"  
"奇怪，" 渚薰喃喃自语，想着绫波。"你认为你父亲和绫波很亲近，对吧？"

Shinji nodded. "Well, yeah, it's supposed to be that way, but why did you ask?"  
真嗣点点头。“嗯，是的，应该是这样，但你为什么这么问？”

"Have you noticed that lately they're rarely seen each other, or even together?"  
“你有没有注意到，最近他们很少见面，甚至很少在一起？”

Shinji shook his head. "It's because you're with her more often, I think."  
真嗣摇摇头。“我想是因为你和她在一起的时间更多了。”

"It's not that," Kaworu corrected. "I think he almost forgot her."  
"不是那样的，"渚薰纠正道，"我觉得他几乎忘记了她。"

"What?"

"Maybe it's his work or something that kept him distracted."  
"或许是他的工作或其他什么事情让他分心了吧。"

"I remember that two nights ago, Misato told me that her father, just before he died, acted in such a way because of his work. Now if he weren't so selfish… I was hoping that Father was a better person."  
"我记得两天前，美里告诉我，她父亲临终前之所以那样，是因为工作。现在如果他不是那么自私……我曾希望父亲是个更好的人。"

"I see," Kaworu figured. "I think that once I became Ayanami's companion, in effect I was her substitute for your father, and because of that..."  
"我明白了，" 渚薰推测道。"我想，一旦我成为绫波的伴侣，实际上我就成了她替代你父亲的角色，正因为如此……"

Shinji shrugged. "I have nothing against you about being Ayanami's boyfriend," he said before chuckling. "You said something to her, right?"  
真嗣耸了耸肩。"我对你是绫波的男朋友这件事没什么意见，" 他笑着说。"你对她说了些什么，对吧？"

"Right, I did," Kaworu said. "We even kissed."  
"没错，我说了，" 渚薰回答。"我们甚至还接吻了。"

"How did you two managed to hit it off… Uh, first base?"  
"你们俩是怎么搭上线的…呃，我是说，发展到第一垒的？"

"That's why I must tell you," Kaworu said. "You see, in the few days I was stuck with Ayanami because the Commander—your father—asked her to be with me. I was with her when she admitted being helpless and unable to remember; I was there when she was hurt in the compatibility test; and I was even keeping an eye on her at the Infirmary.  
"所以我必须告诉你，" 渚薰说。"你看，在我和绫波被困在一起的那几天，是因为司令——你的父亲——让她陪着我。当她承认自己无助且记忆丧失时，我就在她身边；她在同步测试中受伤时，我也在场；甚至在医务室时，我也一直在关注她。

"All along my feelings towards her had grown, especially as I'm concerned with the pain she went through. In those days I felt I was obliged to protect her, to take care of her, and to teach her that there's something more to what she could be. I regard her more as a person than being someone expendable."  
"我对她的感情一直在增长，尤其是当我关心她所经历的痛苦时。在那几天里，我觉得我有责任保护她，照顾她，并教会她，她可以成为的不仅仅是她所认为的那样。我把她看作是一个人，而不是一个可有可无的存在。"

Shinji thought of the disintegrated copies of Rei down at the Dummy Plug Plant, and then remembering how many times he saw Kaworu sticking with her ever since they collided in the hallway.  
真嗣想起了在模拟插入栓工厂里那些被分解的绫波副本，然后又回想起自从他们在走廊相撞后，他看到多少次渚薰一直陪伴在她身边。

"In response to her pain, I reciprocated; I did the best I could to open her heart, and she did. So, before I kissed her I finally admitted my feelings. In her heart she needed something to make her whole, and I gave it. In turn I was changed and saw an entirely different perspective. For the whole time being with Ayanami, without realizing it I saw what love meant for me, and it couldn't be simple as reading it from a book; it must be experienced personally."  
面对她的痛苦，我给予了回应；我尽我所能去打开她的心扉，她也做到了。所以，在我吻她之前，我终于承认了自己的感情。在她的心中，她需要一些东西来使自己完整，而我给予了。反过来，我也被改变了，看到了一个完全不同的视角。在与绫波相处的整个过程中，不知不觉中我明白了对我来说爱意味着什么，它不可能像从书本上读到的那样简单；必须亲自去体验。

Kaworu sighed. "I don't know, but this might be the best thing I ever done in my whole life."  
渚薰叹了口气。“我不知道，但这可能是我一生中做过的最好的事情。”

Shinji smiled. "In my case," he said, "it's different between me and Asuka. Somewhere we understood each other, as our sad experiences seem to put us in the same path. My mother's gone and so does she; we had fathers who care much less; we had our fears, and we were then trying to run away from something we didn't like to confront.  
"真嗣微笑着。“在我和明日香之间，”他说，“情况有所不同。我们在某些地方理解彼此，因为我们的悲伤经历似乎让我们走上了同一条道路。我的母亲去世了，她也一样；我们都有不太关心我们的父亲；我们都有恐惧，都在试图逃避那些我们不愿面对的事情。”

"Asuka finally understood, just as she was about to leave. She didn't want to lie any further as all that posturing does nothing except to confuse things; because of her past, she simply admitted having true feelings for me, even if I was sometimes a frightened person; whenever I was in a tight squeeze, she would give me a push, badger me to get a grip just like when I had to shoot back."  
"“明日香终于在离开前明白了。她不想再继续伪装，因为所有的虚张声势除了让事情更加混乱之外毫无用处；由于她的过去，她坦白了对我的真实感情，即使我有时是个胆小的人；每当我陷入困境时，她都会推我一把，催促我振作起来，就像我必须反击时那样。”

The Third Children sighed. "Well, all in all, for some odd reason we were meant to be together. That's why we said 'I love you' to each other: we finally understood ourselves."  
"第三适格者叹了口气。“总之，出于某种奇怪的原因，我们注定要在一起。这就是为什么我们会对彼此说‘我爱你’：我们终于理解了自己。”

Kaworu nodded. "You're right," he said.  
渚薰点头。“你说得对，”他说。

"What is the meaning of _Instrumentality_?" Fuyutsuki asked them all, as he wrote down the word on the whiteboard behind him and encircled it.  
“什么是人类补完计划？”冬月问他们所有人，同时在他身后的白板上写下这个词并画了个圈。

"Isn't it supposed to be the new age for humanity?" Maya queried.  
“难道它不是人类的新纪元吗？”伊吹问道。

"That is what it claims to be, but…" Fuyutsuki shook his head, and added, "It's really different. In fact, I have studied this myself for years and, suffice to say, that Instrumentality means forcing a form of reversed evolution upon all life on Earth."  
“它自称如此，但……”冬月摇了摇头，补充道，“实际上截然不同。事实上，我自己研究这个课题已有多年，简而言之，人类补完计划意味着对地球上所有生命施加一种逆向进化的过程。”

A round of gasps came from his audience as he briefly explained the basics: the Human Instrumentality Project is the forced evolution of humanity through bringing about Third Impact under the control of anyone who wields the necessary ingredients for its fulfillment. As a result, all Lilin souls would be gathered into Lilith's Egg and united as one being. This would create an existence where nobody existed singularly, but merely as part of the whole.  
当他简要解释基本概念时，听众中传来一阵惊呼：人类补完计划是通过引发受控的第三次冲击，迫使人类进化，任何掌握实现该计划所需要素的人都能操控这一过程。结果是，所有莉莉丝之卵中的莉林灵魂将被聚集并融合为一个整体。这将创造一个不存在单一存在，而仅作为整体一部分的存在。

In Instrumentality, the flaws in every living being would be complemented by the strengths in others, thus erasing the insecurities in people's hearts.  
在补完计划中，每个生物的缺陷将由他人的优势来弥补，从而消除人们心中的不安。

"Hence," Fuyutsuki concluded, "Once that happens there will be nothing left to exist and live, except for humanity and all life reduced into a single form."  
"因此，" 冬月总结道，"一旦这种情况发生，除了人类和所有生命被压缩成单一形态外，将没有任何东西能够存在和生存。"

"What single form?" Aoba questioned.  
"什么单一形态？" 青叶问道。"

Ritsuko stood up and said, "I'm afraid that he's right. Based on some information obtained and studies made about fifteen years ago, what happened during Second Impact can be repeated soon with a Third Impact, should we fail our objective of eliminating the Angels. Actually, there are different scenarios that can arrive to that same conclusion, but first, I'd like to get you down to the basics, which could take some of our time."  
律子站起身来说："恐怕他是对的。根据十五年前获得的一些信息和研究，如果我们未能达成消灭使徒的目标，第二次冲击可能很快会以第三次冲击的形式重演。实际上，有多种情景都可能导致这一结论，但首先，我想带你们回到基本概念，这可能需要我们一些时间。"

The woman then walked up to the whiteboard and scribbled the word "Angel", and added a leading arrow and the name "Adam".  
那女人随后走向白板，潦草地写下“天使”，并加上一个引导箭头和名字“亚当”。

"This is the original what-if, which we're trying to prevent. To refresh your minds, an Angel, once it makes contact with Adam, will cause Adam to generate an anti-AT-Field that can eliminate any life on the planet. Now, I have to correct a fallacy that's been around for too long."  
这是最初的假设情景，我们正试图阻止它发生。为了让你们回忆起来，一旦使徒与亚当接触，亚当将产生一个反 AT 力场，能够消灭地球上所有生命。现在，我必须纠正一个流传已久的谬误。

Ritsuko picked up an eraser and wiped Adam off, before writing the name "Lilith" on the board.  
律子拿起橡皮擦掉了亚当，然后在板上写下了“莉莉丝”的名字。

Half of her audience blinked, for they never heard of Lilith's existence.  
她的听众中有一半人眨了眨眼，因为他们从未听说过莉莉丝的存在。

"What we have here, down beneath our feet, is Lilith," Ritsuko said, and from there she explained about Lilith's existence; the extraterrestrial origins of the Geofront, which was really called Lilith's Egg; and then she went on to elucidate as to why there were two Angels on Earth.  
“我们脚下所见，便是莉莉丝，”赤木律子说道，随后她解释了莉莉丝的存在；地底都市实际上被称为莉莉丝之卵，其外星起源；接着她进一步阐明了地球上为何会出现两个使徒。

"It was theorized that these Eggs were built by an unknown civilization with technology beyond our reckoning, and they were intended to be used for panspermia; presumably as an experiment, they sent these Eggs to propagate life, finding suitable planets.  
“据推测，这些卵是由一个我们无法估量的先进文明所建造，旨在用于泛种论；大概作为一项实验，他们将这些卵发射出去，以在适宜的星球上传播生命。”

"Now, how Lilith came here? According to theory, Adam was the first to be here, but Lilith's Egg, supposed to be en route to another planet, was unexpectedly pulled into Earth and crashed, causing what is called a 'First Impact'.  
“那么，莉莉丝是如何来到这里的？根据理论，亚当是第一个到达此地的，但莉莉丝的卵，本应前往另一颗星球，却意外被地球吸引并坠落，引发了所谓的‘第一次冲击’。”

"This First Impact jumpstarted all life to flourish from Lilith, but the Spear of Longinus prevented Adam from trying to accomplish its intended mission."  
“这次第一次冲击促使所有生命从莉莉丝身上蓬勃发展，但朗基努斯之枪阻止了亚当试图完成其既定使命。”

"So, they carry the Spear all the time?" Makoto asked. "What happened to her Spear?"  
“所以，他们一直携带着那支矛吗？”真琴问道，“她的矛后来怎么样了？”

"Yes, I think, and yes, she did," Ritsuko answered. "The Spear acts as a security device to keep Lilith and Adam, both being Progenitors of Life, under suspended animation. Now, in this case, the crash caused Lilith to lose the Spear securing her, and thus initiating the creation of life.  
"“是的，我认为是这样，而且她的确做到了，”律子回答道，“朗基努斯之枪作为一种安全装置，用于使莉莉丝和亚当这两位生命之源保持休眠状态。现在，在这种情况下，坠落导致莉莉丝失去了固定她的长枪，从而启动了生命的创造。”

"Now, fast-forward to some twenty years ago, when an expedition team discovered Adam and the Spear in Antarctica, both of them intact. The first thing afterwards was to study Adam in secret, and they later found out that Adam possessed a Super Solenoid Engine."  
“现在，快进到大约二十年前，一支探险队在南极发现了完好无损的亚当和朗基努斯之枪。随后首要任务是秘密研究亚当，后来他们发现亚当拥有一个超级螺线管引擎。”

"Which, I'm sorry to say, was what my father went after," Misato added.  
"“很遗憾，那就是我父亲所追求的东西，”美里补充道。”

Ritsuko nodded in acknowledgement. "That's right," she agreed. "Doctor Katsuragi was then trying to find alternative sources of energy, and came upon the S2 Theory, in which he proposed a perpetual machine capable of generating infinite amounts of power."  
律子点头表示认同。“没错，”她同意道，“碇博士当时正在寻找替代能源，并发现了 S2 理论，他提出了一种能够产生无限能量的永动机。”

The S2 Engine Theory was advocated by Dr. Katsuragi, and Ritsuko explained it: as the world (and the universe) was formed with spirals, the engine acquires energy from its shape, the same as the DNA structure. From here, the S2 Engine was envisioned as an energy source that would attempt to procure helical energy — in other words, an inexhaustible supply.  
S2 引擎理论由碇博士倡导，律子解释道：由于世界（以及宇宙）是由螺旋构成的，引擎从其形状中获取能量，这与 DNA 结构相同。由此，S2 引擎被设想为一种试图获取螺旋能量的能源——换句话说，是一种取之不尽的能源。

"The existence of the S2 Engine in Adam confirmed Katsuragi's theory," Ritsuko said, "and from there he was sent to investigate its properties and its future implications for humanity. Unfortunately, as curiosity kills the cat, they went too far by attempting to power up this Engine, and in the process caused Second Impact."  
“亚当体内存在 S2 引擎证实了碇博士的理论，”律子说道，“从此他被派去研究其性质及其对人类未来的影响。不幸的是，正如好奇心害死猫，他们在试图启动这个引擎的过程中走得太远，导致了第二次冲击。”

With the laptop on, Ritsuko typed some commands, arrived at a login screen and entered her password, then accessing a heavily-secured folder in the MAGI, found a video file and loaded it to play. The projector showed first a warning screen declaring the contents a UN top secret, before they could see what appeared to be an underground lab. They could also hear some dialogue, of men and women talking (but more like complaining) about living conditions. Judging from the run-time and the location of the camera being displayed, this was a surveillance video made about fifteen years ago.  
随着笔记本电脑开启，律子输入了一些命令，进入登录界面并输入密码，随后访问了 MAGI 中一个高度加密的文件夹，找到一个视频文件并加载播放。投影仪首先显示了一个警告屏幕，声明内容为联合国最高机密，之后他们看到了一个看似地下实验室的场景。同时还能听到一些对话，男女们谈论（更像是抱怨）生活条件。从运行时间和摄像头位置显示来看，这是一段大约十五年前制作的监控视频。

At the same time Misato shivered, as if the memories of the cataclysm came rushing back like a bogeyman from the closet.  
与此同时，美里打了个寒颤，仿佛灾难的记忆如衣橱里的妖怪般涌回心头。

At a nearby table, with the novel open and both girls seated, Rei read as she flipped one page to another. Whenever she felt stumped about a passage or a word that she couldn't understand, Asuka gave her an explanation.  
在附近的桌子上，小说打开着，两位女孩坐在一起，丽一边翻页一边阅读。每当她对某段文字或某个词感到困惑时，明日香便为她解释。

By page 43, in which Edward introduced himself to Bella at Forks High School's biology laboratory, just before the beginning of their class, Rei remarked, "I am no different from Bella."  
到了第 43 页，爱德华在福克斯高中生物实验室向贝拉介绍自己，就在他们的课程开始之前，丽说：“我和贝拉没什么不同。”

"Sure you do," Asuka said, chuckling softly.  
“当然会的，”明日香轻声笑着说。

"Their meeting was like the first time we met," Rei recalled the day she was face-to-face with Kaworu, right at the Commander's office. "Once I came inside, as I always did, I was then surprised to see him."  
“他们的相遇就像我们第一次见面一样，”丽回忆起那天她与薰面对面站在指挥官办公室的情景。“我像往常一样走进去，然后惊讶地看到了他。”

"How did it go?"  
“情况如何？”

Rei described their encounter, including the first words, and then she said, "He saw into my eyes that I was troubled, that I am in fear. From there, I think, that was when he decided to help me."  
丽描述了他们的相遇，包括最初的对话，然后她说：“他透过我的眼睛看到了我的困扰和恐惧。我想，就是那时他决定帮助我的。”

Choosing her words carefully, Rei then narrated how Kaworu tried to lend a hand, at first attempting to make her remember again, and then she was rescued when Unit-01 rejected her violently. Kaworu had even gone so far as to keep an eye on her while confined at the Infirmary.  
丽谨慎地选择措辞，接着叙述了薰如何试图伸出援手，起初试图让她再次回忆，然后她在初号机剧烈排斥下获救。甚至在医务室里，薰还一直关注着她。

"For the first time," Rei said, "after living a life where I thought myself to be nothing, through him I found a reason to live."  
"第一次，" 丽说，"在我以为自己一无是处的一生之后，通过他，我找到了活下去的理由。"

Asuka took a glance at her watch, and figured that it was time to go.  
明日香瞥了一眼手表，觉得是时候该走了。

"Say, Wondergirl, why don't we borrow the book so that you can finish reading?" she recommended.  
"我说，三无少女，我们为什么不借这本书让你读完呢？" 她建议道。

Rei nodded. "That would be fine."  
丽点了点头。“那很好。”

"And your clothes, too, for tonight," Asuka added, pointing at Rei's school attire. "It'll be interesting to see how you look other than wearing that school uniform."  
“还有你今晚的衣服，”明日香补充道，指着丽的校服。“看看你不穿校服的样子会很有趣。”

---

After all the screams, the klaxons and the crashes, and the mysterious figure of light smashing its way out, once the video concluded with the UN warning screen, everyone, except for Misato, Ritsuko and Fuyutsuki, were completely stunned to silence.  
在所有的尖叫声、警报声和撞击声之后，以及那个神秘的光影破空而出，当视频以联合国警告屏幕结束时，除了美里、律子和冬月之外，所有人都完全震惊得鸦雀无声。

"That how the first scenario was based on," Ritsuko said, breaking the eerie quietness. "But then, there's another."  
"那就是第一个设想的基础，" 律子打破了诡异的寂静，说道，"但接下来，还有另一个。"

"Another?" Natsumi questioned. More whispering around her.  
"另一个？" 夏美问道，周围又是一阵窃窃私语。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Yes, because Colonel Katsuragi has stumbled into an unusual development going on within the other branches, which is why she'll give you the heads-up."  
冬月点头道："是的，因为葛城上校发现了其他分支中出现了一个不寻常的动向，这就是为什么她会提前通知你们。"

As if on cue, Misato went to the laptop and opened the Shanghai surveillance files that Makoto sent to her days ago.  
仿佛是按了提示键，美里走向笔记本电脑，打开了几天前真琴发给她的上海监控文件。

"A source, which I shall leave unnamed for secrecy, had sent me these pictures," she said, and put the photos onscreen. Being shot hastily from a pinhole camera, and while in motion, the pictures were almost out of focus, they showed them what looked to be Eva units, but with unusual modifications, with a disturbingly organic appearance, and all painted white.  
“一个我出于保密不能透露姓名的来源，给我发了这些照片，”她说着，将照片投放到屏幕上。由于是从针孔摄像头匆忙拍摄且在移动中，照片几乎失焦，但仍能看出似乎是 EVA 单位，但有着不寻常的改装，呈现出令人不安的有机外观，且全部被涂成了白色。

Misato went on, "My source also told me that they've been developed under the collusion with our overseas branches without our knowledge, which brings us to the question: who ordered the creation of these new Evas? And for what purpose?  
"美里继续说道：“我的消息来源还告诉我，这些 EVA 是在我们不知情的情况下，与我们的海外分支机构勾结开发的，这让我们不得不问：是谁下令制造这些新型 EVA？又是出于什么目的？”

"The Instrumentality Committee is the only authority higher than us, which can issue such an expensive order. Now, where these new Evas would be used? Doctor Akagi can then answer this."  
"人类补完委员会是唯一有权向我们下达如此昂贵命令的机构。那么，这些新的 EVA 将被用于何处？赤木博士可以回答这个问题。"

Standing aside, Misato nodded to Ritsuko to continue where she left off, taking center stage. On the laptop, she selected one of the few pictures that have little blurring and enlarged it on the projector, showing one of the white Evas standing, held down by braces, the elongated head leering down.  
站在一旁，美里向律子点头示意她继续中断的地方，走上前台。在笔记本电脑上，她选择了一张模糊较少的图片并将其放大到投影仪上，显示出其中一台白色 EVA 站立着，被支架固定，长长的头部向下俯视。

"As you can see," Ritsuko lectured, "this is far different than any of the Evas we have in our inventory. The head is unnatural, like you've stuck a whale's head onto a standard Eva body; there are no eyes either, so they may be using specialized sensors to 'see' their way around; there are no pauldrons either, which means that they could be using some kind of weapon, and that they may not be using an external battery pack, just like our Evas, which comes down to one possibility that they may now have a fully-functional S2 Engine. Worse, it's also likely that through our technology and information exchanges with our branches, somehow they may have built, without our knowledge… a working Dummy Plug."  
"正如你们所见，"律子讲解道，"这与我们库存中的任何 EVA 都截然不同。头部异常，就像把鲸鱼的头部安在了标准 EVA 的身体上；也没有眼睛，因此它们可能使用专门的传感器来‘看’路；也没有肩甲，这意味着它们可能使用某种武器，并且可能不像我们的 EVA 那样使用外部电池包，这指向了一种可能性——它们现在可能拥有完全功能的 S2 引擎。更糟糕的是，通过与我们分支的技术和信息交流，它们可能在不知情的情况下……建造了一个可运作的替身插头。""

Her audience gave her astonished looks.  
她的听众们露出了惊讶的表情。

"And why not?" Ritsuko said. "As some of you may have no idea, it's my sad regret to tell you that in the past we used Rei Ayanami as the basis for our failed Dummy Plug initiative, trying to make the Evas function on their own."  
“为什么不呢？”赤木律子说道，“可能有些人还不知道，我遗憾地告诉你们，过去我们曾以绫波丽为蓝本进行失败的 Dummy Plug 计划，试图让 Eva 自行运作。”

Ritsuko took the whiteboard marker and wrote down Kaworu's full name. "But with this development, however," she went on, "Nagisa's presence tells me that the Committee may have used him to build their Dummy Plug, just like Rei; if there's one, there might be more… So, Miss Ibuki, I believe that you still have the initial test results on him, right?"  
赤木律子拿起白板笔，写下渚薰的全名。“但有了这一进展，”她继续说道，“渚的存在让我觉得委员会可能也利用了他来构建 Dummy Plug，就像绫波一样；如果有他一个，可能还会有更多……所以，伊吹小姐，我相信你那里还保留着他的初始测试结果，对吧？”

Maya blinked twice. "Uh, yes, ma'am," she answered, pulling out a PDA from her pocket. "I think they're still here."  
玛雅眨了眨眼。“呃，是的，女士，”她回答道，从口袋里掏出一个 PDA。“我想他们还在这里。”

Ritsuko nodded. "Okay, copy the files to me."  
律子点了点头。“好的，把文件传给我。”

With the room being set up for wireless networking, Maya copied the files to the laptop, and then Ritsuko loaded the report, which contained Kaworu's test results.  
房间已经设置好无线网络，玛雅将文件复制到笔记本电脑上，随后律子加载了报告，里面包含了渚薰的测试结果。

"Thank you," Ritsuko said, and then she pointed at the projected report on the whiteboard. "As you can see the graph here, Kaworu Nagisa has the capacity to set his sync rate at _will_. One minute he can lower it down to as much as ten percent, just to give his opponent a sporting chance, but in the next, he can drive up to eighty and maybe even more to crush his enemy to kingdom come. Now, I tell you why this is worrying: if Nagisa's thought patterns have been copied to the Dummy Plugs, it means that if these new Evas possess them, along with their own S2 Engines, then we could be in deep trouble."  
"谢谢你，" 律子说道，随即指向白板上投影的报告。"正如你们所见，这里的图表显示，渚薰能够随意设定同步率。一分钟内他可以将同步率降至百分之十，只为给对手一个公平的机会，但下一刻，他又能飙升至百分之八十甚至更高，彻底击溃敌人。现在，我来告诉你们这为何令人担忧：如果薰的思维模式已被复制到模拟插入栓中，这意味着如果这些新型 EVA 装备了它们以及自身的 S2 引擎，那么我们可能会陷入大麻烦。"

"So what are we going to do, then?" Makoto asked, looking worried.  
"那么我们该怎么办呢？" 真嗣问道，面露忧色。

"Now, such a combination of these factors brings us to one problem: what is the real motive of the Instrumentality Committee to construct these Evas? Simple… I conclude, much to my regret, that they are preparing to _force_ Instrumentality upon us, by using Unit One as a substitute for Lilith, with these new Evas as the catalyst."  
"现在，这些因素的结合引出了一个问题：人类补完委员会制造这些 EVA 的真正动机是什么？简单……我遗憾地得出结论，他们正准备利用初号机替代莉莉丝，借助这些新型 EVA 作为催化剂，强行推动人类补完计划。"

Misato sighed, and added, "In other words, they're about to create their own Third Impact… right in our backyard."  
美里叹了口气，补充道：“换句话说，他们即将在我们眼皮底下制造自己的第三次冲击。”

Instantly the room was filled with surprised gasps, followed by worried whispering and frowns on their faces.  
房间里立刻充满了惊讶的吸气声，随后是担忧的窃窃私语和紧皱的眉头。

"Which is why, because our Commander has deviated from their plans," Fuyutsuki said, looking determined. "It is now urgent, more than ever, that we must prepare ourselves for this worst-case scenario; we may have to stop them before they could end human existence... and it will be up to _us_, and to Shinji and Asuka to finish this damned thing once and for all."  
“这就是为什么，因为我们的司令偏离了他们的计划，”冬月说，神情坚定。“现在比以往任何时候都更加紧迫，我们必须为这种最坏的情况做好准备；我们可能不得不在他们终结人类存在之前阻止他们……这将取决于我们，以及真嗣和明日香来彻底结束这该死的一切。”

Once they finished dressing up, Kaworu walked up to Shinji and said, "Before we go, I want you to remember this."  
装扮完毕后，渚薰走到真嗣面前说道：“在我们出发前，我希望你记住这一点。”

"What?" Shinji asked. "什么？" 真嗣问道。

Kaworu took a breath as he laid his hand on Shinji's shoulder. He could also feel the beating of his heart. "Since you're much of a brother to me, I just want to say… _I love you_."  
渚薰深吸一口气，将手放在真嗣的肩上。他也能感受到对方心跳的节奏。“既然你对我来说就像兄弟一样，我只想说……我爱你。”

Shinji blinked, and then he blushed. "R… Really?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，随即脸红了。“真……真的吗？”

Kaworu smiled. "It's one sincere way for me to thank you all. I owe you for changing me, and nothing else could be exchanged for such an experience we're sharing. As for you, since you have a fragile heart… Take care of it, even as you may have to face the hardest tests of your life and theirs, hell or high water."  
渚薰微笑着。“这是我表达感谢的一种真诚方式。我欠你们一个人情，是你们改变了我，没有任何东西能与这段共同经历相提并论。至于你，既然你有一颗脆弱的心……请好好照顾它，即使你可能不得不面对生命中最艰难的考验，无论是地狱还是洪水。”

To reassure him, Kaworu clapped Shinji on the shoulder.  
为了让他安心，渚薰拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。

"Have faith in yourself," Kaworu added.  
“要相信自己，”渚薰补充道。

"W… Well," Shinji stammered, immensely grateful for Kaworu's declaration, before he smiled. "I'll remember, and I thank you, too."  
"嗯…嗯，" 真嗣结巴着，对渚薰的声明感到无比感激，随后微笑道，"我会记住的，也谢谢你。"

Kaworu nodded, and he smiled. "Come on, then. I think they're waiting for us."  
渚薰点点头，微笑着说："走吧，我想他们在等我们。"

### Chapter 30 In the Garden of Kaji's Eden  
Chapter 30 卡吉伊乐园的花园

"One more thing, sir," Misato said, just as they were about to conclude the meeting upon Fuyutsuki's declaration. Already the others were gathering up their notes and packing them into folders.  
"还有一件事，先生，" 美里说道，就在他们即将在冬月宣布会议结束时。其他人已经开始收拾笔记，将它们装进文件夹。

"Pardon me, Colonel?" Fuyutsuki asked. Everyone else stopped to listen.  
"抱歉，上校？" 冬月问道。其他人也都停下来聆听。

"Well," Misato said, "Kaji left some information with me, but now that everything has fallen into place, I wonder if all this answers what questions he had when he searched for the truth." She then pulled the miniaturized flash memory capsule out from her pocket, and looked at it.  
"嗯，" 美里说，"加持留下了一些信息给我，但现在一切都已经水落石出，我想知道这是否解答了他当初寻找真相时所提出的问题。" 她随后从口袋里拿出了微型闪存胶囊，并注视着它。

Fuyutsuki sighed. "What matters now that his death is no longer in vain," he said, "and everything that transpired here for the last few years have made perfect sense: everything has fallen into place. Now the question of our survival depends on how we could act on this knowledge."  
冬月叹了口气。“现在重要的是，他的死不再是无谓的牺牲，”他说，“过去几年在这里发生的一切都变得合情合理：一切都已各就各位。现在我们生存的问题取决于我们如何利用这些知识。”

"Exactly, sir," Misato agreed. "Now it makes perfect sense why they wanted Asuka to die."  
“确实如此，长官，”美里同意道。“现在一切都解释得通了，他们为什么想要明日香死。”

The old man frowned. "Why?"  
老人皱起眉头。“为什么？”

"Take Asuka and Unit Two out of the picture," she said, "and without her to distract them, those new Evas would be going after Unit One like a pack of wolves."  
“把明日香和二号机排除在外，”她说，“没有她来分散注意力，那些新 EVA 会像狼群一样追着初号机不放。”

"In that case, you'll have to tell those kids to be very careful," Fuyutsuki said with concern. "She's one of our two aces in the sleeve right now."  
"那样的话，你得告诉那些孩子们要非常小心，" 冬月带着关切说道，"她是我们目前仅有的两张王牌之一。"

Misato nodded. "I'll do that, sir."  
美里点头，"我会注意的，长官。"

"Furthermore, you will not discuss this with the Children unless they're prepared to listen. Is that clear?"  
"此外，除非孩子们准备好倾听，否则你不得与他们讨论此事。清楚了吗？"

"That'll be perfectly clear," Misato answered.  
"那会非常清楚的，" 美里回答道。

"But sir, now that the Commander has Adam," Natsumi wondered aloud, "what could we do with him?" The question was another shocker.  
"但是长官，既然司令已经得到了亚当，" 娜兹美大声问道，"我们能对他做什么呢？" 这个问题又是一个震撼弹。

"I didn't know that," Fuyutsuki said, visibly startled. "How that happened?"  
"我之前并不知情，" 冬月说道，明显感到惊讶。"这是怎么发生的？"

Natsumi told everyone that she performed the surgical operation on Commander Ikari's left hand, to graft Adam directly onto his palm. Having never told Adam's exact purpose, she feared for any dark implications that can arise from the possession of this creature.  
夏美告诉所有人，她为碇司令的左手进行了手术，将亚当直接移植到他的手掌上。她从未透露过亚当的确切用途，因此担心拥有这生物会带来什么不祥的后果。

In complete disbelief, Fuyutsuki shook his head before he took the time to ponder, and they waited on him for his word.  
完全不敢相信，冬月摇了摇头，然后才开始深思，其他人则等待着他的表态。

"Mister Kanzaki," Fuyutsuki said after a moment, breaking the silence.  
“Kanzaki 先生，”冬月片刻后说道，打破了沉默。

"Yes, sir?" Tsutomo said.  
“是的，先生？”筒友说。

"If we have to stop him, this isn't the right time," he warned. "Right now, if we move too hastily without thinking first, and discovers our initiative, we would run the risk of treason. So I need you to come to Hamamoto and ask that I need to talk to him later about what we're up against. Given that he's not happy as we are, if I explain everything to him, I hope that he could oblige himself to help us."  
“如果我们必须阻止他，现在不是时候，”他警告道。“眼下，如果我们不先思考就贸然行动，被他发现我们的意图，我们就有叛变的危险。所以我需要你去滨本那里，告诉他我稍后需要和他谈谈我们所面对的情况。考虑到他也不如我们高兴，如果我向他解释一切，我希望他能自愿帮助我们。”

Tsutomo nodded. 筒友点点头。

Fuyutsuki sighed. "And by the way," he said thereafter, "whatever we have said today should never leave this room. I remind you that from this point onward we will have to be very careful with every step we do, with every word we say or write, and what we think. Is that clear?"  
冬月叹了口气。“顺便说一句，”他随后说道，“我们今天所说的一切绝不能离开这个房间。我提醒你们，从现在开始，我们每一步行动，每一句话，每一笔记录，以及我们的思考，都必须非常谨慎。清楚了吗？”

Everyone answered in unison: "Yes, sir!"  
众人齐声回答：“是的，先生！”

In their quarters, as Asuka pulled out her spare T-shirt and a pair of jeans from one of her bags, Rei stripped herself down to underwear, setting her uniform aside. As she stood there waiting, Asuka handed over the garments to Rei and said, "Here they are, and I hope they're the right size."  
在她们的房间里，当明日香从包里拿出备用 T 恤和一条牛仔裤时，丽脱下了自己的制服，只留下内衣。她站在那里等待，明日香递过衣物给丽，并说：“给你，希望尺寸合适。”

Rei first tried the jeans, which surprisingly fit over her hips as she pulled the zipper up, before wearing the shirt over her head. She then walked over to a mirror and glanced at herself.  
丽先试穿了牛仔裤，出乎意料地合身，她拉上拉链，然后套上 T 恤。接着，她走到镜子前，打量着自己。

For the first time she was wearing something other than her everyday school uniform, and gave the redhead a faint smile.  
这是她第一次穿上除了日常校服以外的衣服，她对红发女孩露出了淡淡的微笑。

Asuka nodded. "Not bad," she approved with a grin, but an idea suddenly popped into her head. "Now, what else? Oh, yeah, why don't I try to put some makeup on you, just to see if they look good?"  
明日香点点头。“不错嘛，”她咧嘴一笑，但突然一个念头闪过脑海。“现在，还有什么呢？哦，对了，我给你化个妆试试，看看效果如何？”

Rei blinked. "Makeup?" 绫波眨了眨眼。“化妆？”

"Yeah," Asuka replied as she opened one of Misato's duffel bags and from inside grabbed a bottle of facial cleanser, some cotton balls, eyeliner, mascara, facial powder, and a tube of light lipstick; she laid them all on the bed. "I've been waiting to do this for a very loooooong time," she quipped before chuckling.  
“是啊，”明日香一边回答，一边打开美里的一只旅行袋，从中拿出洗面奶、棉球、眼线笔、睫毛膏、粉饼和一支浅色口红，将它们一一摆在床上。“我可是等这一刻等了很久很久了，”她打趣道，随即轻笑起来。

Asuka then pulled a stool aside and gestured to Rei to sit down. "Now, keep yourself still," she advised before opening the cleanser bottle and splashed the contents onto a ball of cotton.  
明日香随后拉过一把凳子，示意丽坐下。“现在，保持不动，”她建议道，然后打开洁面乳瓶子，将内容物倒在棉球上。

"Is this necessary?" Rei asked.  
“这有必要吗？”丽问道。

"Have to make sure your face is clean," Asuka answered as she began to wipe Rei's face with the soaked cotton. In reaction to the cleanser's alcohol on the skin, Rei grimaced a bit but otherwise held herself as Asuka went about rubbing the girl's cheeks, then the forehead before moving on to the chin and neck.  
“得确保你的脸干净，”明日香回答着，开始用浸湿的棉球擦拭丽的脸。感受到洁面乳中的酒精刺激，丽微微皱眉，但仍保持不动，任由明日香擦拭她的脸颊、额头，接着是下巴和脖子。

Once done, Asuka then applied the eyeliner and the mascara. "Don't blink," she warned as she worked on Rei's eyes. "Just relax. I'll put these to highlight your eyes, but I don't want to put too much."  
完成后，Asuka 接着涂上了眼线和睫毛膏。“别眨眼，”她一边在 Rei 的眼睛上操作一边提醒道。“放松就好。我会用这些来突出你的眼睛，但不想用得太多。”

Inwardly Rei found the experience rather interesting and refreshing; in fact she never did, not even at school, when while the girls of her age were experimenting with makeup in the ladies' room, all she did was to wash her face and wipe clean with a handkerchief. Her classmates, some of them afflicted with pimples, wondered how she managed to have those nice blemish-free cheeks without resorting to any over-the-counter facial products or even cosmetic surgery.  
Rei 内心觉得这个经历相当有趣且令人耳目一新；事实上，她从未尝试过，即使在学校的女生们都在洗手间里尝试化妆时，她只是洗脸并用纸巾擦干净。她的同学们，有些被痘痘困扰，好奇她如何在没有使用任何非处方面部产品甚至整容手术的情况下，拥有那些无瑕的脸颊。

"In case you're wondering," Asuka said, carefully daubing the mascara onto Rei's lashes. "I'm doing this as a way to teach you about what it's like to be on your own, and putting makeup is one of those things."  
“以防你好奇，”Asuka 小心翼翼地将睫毛膏涂在 Rei 的睫毛上，说道，“我这么做是为了教你独立生活的感受，而化妆就是其中的一部分。”

Once done, Rei blinked twice as she looked at the mirror. Her eyes looked a bit different, accentuated by the makeup.  
完成后，丽对着镜子眨了两次眼。她的眼睛看起来有些不同，被妆容突显了出来。

"What do you think?" Asuka questioned.  
“你觉得怎么样？”明日香问道。

"It is unusual for me," Rei answered.  
“对我来说很罕见，”丽回答道。

Asuka nodded. "Well, it's because it's your first time. Now, let's try the facial powder," she said, grinning while opening up the Shu Uemura powder clamshell and began applying it onto Rei's cheeks.  
明日香点了点头。“嗯，因为这是你第一次嘛。现在，让我们试试这款粉饼，”她笑着打开植村秀的粉饼盒，开始在丽的面颊上涂抹。

"Is this how you prepare for…," Rei said, trying to find the right word, "dating?"  
“这是为了准备……”丽试图找到合适的词，“约会吗？”

"Exactly," Asuka replied, still working on the right cheek. "You have to blow out the mind of your opposite, and you should know that."  
“没错，”明日香继续在右颊上涂抹，“你得让对方心神荡漾，这点你应该明白。”

"I see, but what is 'blowing out the mind'?"  
"我明白了，但‘震撼心灵’是什么意思？"

"Again, it's an idiom," Asuka said, this time on Rei's left cheek. "Means you make them look dumb the first time they see you; they get dazzled, drop their jaws, open their eyes like they're surprised, and say, 'is that _really_ her?' That's what attraction is all about, Rei. You knock 'em dead."  
"又是一个成语，" 明日香说，这次是在绫波的左脸颊上。"意思是初次见面就让他们显得愚蠢；他们会被惊艳到，目瞪口呆，瞪大眼睛好像很惊讶，然后说，‘真的是她吗？’这就是吸引力的全部，绫波。你让他们为之倾倒。"

Now Asuka went about inspecting Rei's face, scrutinizing her handiwork, making sure she didn't left too much or little, before going on to the lipstick; Asuka twisted the tube till the pink end emerged.  
现在明日香开始仔细检查绫波的脸，审视自己的成果，确保没有过多或过少，然后继续涂口红；明日香旋转着管子，直到粉红色的部分露出来。

"What is that?" "那是什么？"

Inwardly Asuka was a bit amused at Rei's reactions, as though the First Children was questioning like a kindergartener, curious about the world around her.  
内心深处，明日香对绫波的反应感到一丝好笑，仿佛这位第一适格者像幼儿园的孩子一样，对周围的世界充满好奇。

"Well, this?" Asuka said, holding the lipstick tube. "It's lipstick, but don't worry, it's just light pink, not red."  
"这个吗？" 明日香举起口红管说道，"这是口红，不过别担心，只是浅粉色，不是红色。"

"I understand now," Rei agreed.  
"我现在明白了，"丽同意道。

"All right, just hold still as I put this on you," Asuka said before she began carefully tracing lipstick along Rei's lips, trying not to apply too much or little as the tube was the only one of two left (the other being "Marilyn Monroe Red") in Misato's bag.  
"好了，就这样别动，我给你涂上这个，"明日香说着，开始小心翼翼地沿着丽的嘴唇描画口红，尽量不多不少，因为这是米莎托包里仅剩的两支口红之一（另一支是"玛丽莲·梦露红"）。

Finished, Asuka nodded to Rei to stand up and see for herself in the mirror. "Well?" the redhead asked.  
完成后，明日香示意丽站起来，在镜子前自己看看。"怎么样？"红发女孩问道。

"I… I look different," Rei said. "I cannot tell if I am…"  
"我…我看起来不一样了，" 丽说。"我不知道自己是否…"

"Beautiful," Asuka added, inspecting her handiwork.  
"很美，" 明日香补充道，审视着自己的杰作。

"But… I do not want the things around my eyes." Rei pointed at the mascara and the eyeliner.  
"但是…我不想要眼周的这些东西。" 丽指着睫毛膏和眼线笔说。

Asuka blinked. "What?" 明日香眨了眨眼。“什么？”

"They look too dark. I do not like it."  
"它们看起来太暗了，我不喜欢。"

"Yet they can make your eyes look more attractive," Asuka said, but changed her mind with a sigh. "Ah, okay, you're right… Let's try to take it off."  
"但它们能让你的眼睛看起来更有吸引力，""明日香说，随即叹了口气改变了主意。""啊，好吧，你说得对……我们试试把它卸掉。"

"Yes," Rei said as the redhead rummaged through the bag and found a jar of Ponds; this she used to wipe away the mascara.  
"好的，""丽说，与此同时红发女孩在包里翻找，找到了一罐旁氏卸妆乳；她用这个来卸除睫毛膏。"

Now this time Rei looked nicer, with the minimum amount of makeup.  
这次丽看起来更顺眼了，只化了最少的妆。

"What do you think?" Asuka inquired this time.  
“你觉得怎么样？”这次是明日香问道。

"This is better," Rei commented with a small hint of a smile. "Thank you."  
“这样好多了，”丽带着一丝微笑评论道，“谢谢你。”

While Rei kept on looking at herself in the mirror, Asuka took hold of her cellphone and began making a text message for Shinji and Kaworu to come down here; she was thrilled to show to them what she had wrought.  
Rei 继续在镜子前打量自己，而 Asuka 则拿起手机，开始给 Shinji 和 Kaworu 发短信，让他们下来；她兴奋地想向他们展示自己的杰作。

---

On their way up to the bachelor quarters area, to their temporary abode he shared with Asuka and Misato, Shinji thought of the words that Kaworu said before they left the baths.  
在他们前往单身宿舍区的路上，前往他与 Asuka 和 Misato 暂时同住的住所时，Shinji 回想起离开浴室前 Kaworu 说的话。

In his entire life he had received little amount of affection, respect or a measure of appreciation for the things he did. Try as he might, he couldn't get anything from his father, a man he was supposed to look up as an example and respected. Sure, there were words of praise, but they were hollow and meaningless, devoid of emotion or warmth as if he wasn't his father's son.  
在他的一生中，他很少得到关爱、尊重或对他所做事情的认可。尽管他努力尝试，却无法从他本应视为榜样并尊敬的父亲那里得到任何东西。当然，也有过赞扬的话语，但它们空洞无物，缺乏情感或温暖，仿佛他不是父亲的儿子。

He asked himself, _did Father loved Mom? How that came to be? How Mom could love a man like him? What really happened between them?_  
他问自己，父亲爱妈妈吗？这一切是如何发生的？妈妈怎么会爱上像他那样的男人？他们之间究竟发生了什么？

Shinji sighed, knowing that the questions may never be answered, as his father only knew yet would never tell a word about his personal life.  
真嗣叹了口气，知道这些问题可能永远没有答案，因为他的父亲只字不提自己的私生活。

Yet…

If his father can't love him, fine. Asuka was now the love of his life, and they reciprocated each other since yesterday; Misato loved him, even without saying the words, as though he was her younger surrogate brother; and Rei… well, Shinji knew that he'll have to love her in the same way…  
如果父亲不能爱他，那就算了。明日香现在是他的挚爱，他们从昨天起就互相爱慕；美里虽然没有说出口，但对他就像对待自己的弟弟一样；而丽……好吧，真嗣知道他必须以同样的方式去爱她……

As if Rei was his twin sister.  
仿佛丽是他的双胞胎妹妹。

The thought made him chuckle; he felt lucky today, glad and feeling secure this time. But that's not all, because Kaworu declared that he loved him just like he was his brother, and that was one of the few words of affection he heard from someone he even barely knew for a few days.  
这个想法让他轻笑出声；他今天感到幸运，高兴且安心。但这还不是全部，因为渚薰宣称他爱他就像爱自己的兄弟一样，这是他从仅认识几天的某人那里听到的为数不多的温情话语之一。

Today, and yesterday, might as well be the two days that Shinji will remember for the rest of his life, for what love and affection he could not get from his father, he can get from the people closest to him, people who belong to his surrogate family. That, indeed, was a reward better than all the gold in the world.  
今天，还有昨天，或许是真嗣一生中会铭记的两天，因为从父亲那里得不到的爱与关怀，他可以从身边最亲近的人那里获得，那些属于他替代家庭的人们。这确实是一种比世界上所有黄金都更珍贵的回报。

What more he could ask for?  
他还能奢求什么呢？

The question suddenly thought of his mother. Was she listening all the time? Knowing what was happening to him? Feeling his emotions at the moment?  
这个问题突然让他想起了母亲。她一直在听吗？知道他身上发生的事吗？感受到他此刻的情感吗？

Shinji wished she was here. In person. Calling his name with arms wide open, ready to listen to all of what he wanted to say, without fear or doubt, making up for the time lost…  
真嗣希望她在这里。亲自来。张开双臂呼唤他的名字，准备好倾听他想说的一切，没有恐惧或疑虑，弥补失去的时光……

Suddenly he felt his phone vibrate, knocking off his train of thought. He then pulled the phone out of his pocket and opened the clamshell, pressing a button and then read the message from Asuka.  
突然，他感觉到手机震动，打断了他的思绪。他随即从口袋里掏出手机，打开翻盖，按下一个按钮，然后阅读了来自明日香的信息。

"What does she say?" Kaworu asked, a bit perturbed by the unexpected text message.  
“她说什么？”渚薰问道，对这条突如其来的短信感到有些不安。

"She likes you to check out Ayanami," Shinji said as he put the phone away.  
“她喜欢你关注绫波，”真嗣说着将手机收了起来。

Kaworu blinked. "About what?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。“关于什么？”

Shinji shrugged. "I have no idea, but maybe she wants to surprise you."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我不知道，但也许她想给你个惊喜。”

"I see."

Once they came up at the door, Shinji first knocked but Asuka loudly answered, "Just a moment!"  
当他们走到门口时，真嗣先敲了敲门，但明日香大声回应道：“稍等一下！”

Shinji sighed and asked himself, "What were they doing?"  
真嗣叹了口气，自问道：“他们在做什么？”

Kaworu didn't answer but the door slid open, and suddenly Asuka pulled Shinji in and exclaimed, "Hey, look at her!"  
薰没有回答，但门滑开了，突然明日香把真嗣拉了进去，惊呼道：“嘿，看她！”

The Fifth Children took a glance at Rei and blinked twice. There she was, standing, wearing a white baby t-shirt that accentuated her figure instead of hiding it; the tight jeans did the same effect to her hips. Finally the light makeup, along with a good hair-brushing to straighten out the kinks, brought out a bit more of Rei's natural beauty.  
第五适格者瞥了一眼丽，眨了两次眼。她就站在那里，穿着一件凸显身材而非隐藏它的白色婴儿 T 恤；紧身牛仔裤同样突出了她的臀部。最后，加上恰到好处的妆容和梳理顺滑的头发，让丽的自然美更加凸显出来。

"Any comments?" Asuka questioned the boys, cocking her head sideways. "I've put some makeup on her… Because I wanted to try."  
"有什么意见吗？" 明日香侧头问男孩们，"我给她化了点妆……因为我想试试。"

But Kaworu and Shinji were speechless for a moment, blinking as if they wanted to make sure their eyes weren't lying to them.  
但真嗣和薰一时语塞，眨着眼仿佛要确认自己的眼睛没有欺骗他们。

Asuka smacked her hand over the forehead. "Aw, come on, what's the big deal?" she asked aloud.  
明日香一拍额头。"哎呀，有什么大不了的？" 她大声问道。

"I… I can't say," Shinji said, fumbling to get the right words out of his mouth, "I think she really looks... Uh, nice."  
"我…我说不出口，" 真嗣结结巴巴地试图找到合适的词，"我觉得她看起来真的…呃，挺好的。"

"Lame answer, you dummy," Asuka objected.  
"真逊的回答，你这个笨蛋，" 明日香反驳道。"

"No, really, I'm telling you the truth," Shinji answered back.  
"不，真的，我说的都是实话，" 真嗣回道。"

As the two other Children argued, Kaworu approached Rei. "What took you so long?" she asked.  
"当另外两个孩子争论时，渚薰走向绫波。“你怎么这么晚？”她问道。”

"I'm sorry, but it took a bit longer than I expected," Kaworu replied, hand running over his hair. "Never got to talk to him personally, so we ran late."  
“对不起，比预期的要久一些，”渚薰回答，手抚过自己的头发。“没能亲自和他交谈，所以耽搁了。”

"I see," Rei said. "What do you think about my appearance?" she asked, turning around for Kaworu to see.  
"“这样啊，”绫波说。“你觉得我的样子如何？”她转过身来让渚薰看。”

Kaworu smiled. "I don't want to exaggerate this, but I'm surprised that Asuka could do this for you; you look stunning with that makeup."  
渚薰微笑道：“我不想夸大其词，但我很惊讶明日香能为你做到这个地步；你化了妆后真是惊艳。”

"Thank you. I want to try something new, and this is my first time. She is also very good."  
“谢谢。我想尝试些新东西，这是第一次。她也很擅长这个。”

The Fifth Children glanced at the wall clock; it was still early, almost three o'clock.  
第五适格者瞥了一眼墙上的时钟；时间还早，差不多三点钟。

"I just want to ask… Where's Kaji's garden?" Kaworu asked.  
"我只是想问……Kaji 的花园在哪里？" 渚薰问道。

Shinji paused to think, trying to recall the last time he was there, when hell broke loose with a rampaging Angel, but Kaji, oddly enough, was watering the watermelon patch for no reason except for the claim that he decided not to intervene with the defense of the complex.  
真嗣停下来思考，试图回忆上次去那里的情景，当时地狱般的情况因一头横冲直撞的天使而爆发，但奇怪的是，Kaji 却在毫无理由地给西瓜地浇水，除了声称他决定不干预基地的防御外。

"There's a trail going from here to the Geofront wall," Shinji said. "You should be able to see it… Uh, I think it goes from…" he trailed off, attempting to remember the orientation and the direction, but then he saw a pen and a pad on the dining table, went there and grabbed them both, before returning to sketch out the location.  
"从这里到地底都市墙有一条小径，" 真嗣说。"你应该能看到它……呃，我想是从……" 他话音渐弱，试图回忆方向和方位，但随后他看到餐桌上有一支笔和一本便签，便走过去拿起它们，然后回来勾勒出位置。

Once done, Shinji said, "If I'm right, the patch should be right before you at the end of the trail." The boy sighed and asked, "What are you two going to do there?"  
完成后，真嗣说道：“如果我没猜错，那块地应该就在小径尽头，就在你面前。”男孩叹了口气，问道：“你们俩打算去那儿做什么？”

"I wanted to do an errand for Misato before we move on to Rei's place," Kaworu said as he took the impromptu map from Shinji. "Have to water the patch because she didn't have much time."  
“我想在去绫波家之前，先帮美里办件事，”薰从真嗣手中接过临时地图说道，“得给那块地浇水，因为她时间不多。”

"Oh," Asuka blurted.

"It's going to be a long way from here, however, so you might have to borrow a bicycle at the main hall," Shinji advised.  
“不过从这里过去路途遥远，你可能得在大厅借辆自行车，”真嗣建议道。

"Okay," Kaworu answered. "I'll keep that in mind."  
“好的，”渚薰回答，“我会记住的。”

Just then Rei asked, "Is it acceptable if I must change back to my uniform first? I want to keep tonight's clothes clean."  
就在这时，绫波零问道：“如果我需要先换回制服，这样可以吗？我想保持今晚的衣服干净。”

Asuka nodded. "Sure, but use the bathroom instead." _Because if you try it here, you might cause a nosebleed flood,_ she quipped in her thoughts.  
明日香点头道：“当然，不过要用洗手间。”因为在这种地方尝试的话，可能会引发鼻血泛滥，她心里打趣地想。

Somewhere within the bowels of Central Dogma, Sanderson was trying to affix a remotely-detonated bomb onto a large switchbox, which was used to control the flow of Bakelite throughout the entire complex.  
在中央教条深处的某个角落，桑德森正试图将一枚远程引爆的炸弹固定在一个大型开关盒上，该开关盒用于控制整个设施内酚醛塑料的流动。

Apart from being used as a phased-matter restraining fluid, Bakelite can also be used to flood whole areas as a security measure, to permanently seal off contaminated areas in case of biological, chemical or nuclear accidents, or in the event of armed intrusion.  
除了作为相变物质约束流体使用外，酚醛塑料还可用于大面积淹没作为安全措施，以永久封闭受生物、化学或核事故污染的区域，或在武装入侵事件中使用。

Once the switchbox is destroyed, it would give the assault teams no obstacles to mop up every level until nothing is left alive. Following the dictum that the most modern technology is vulnerable to the primitive weapons of warfare, Sanderson planted several other bombs to disable most of the Geofront's defenses, including anti-aircraft batteries, missile silos, sensor arrays, radomes, communication towers, and remotely-controlled armored gates.  
一旦开关盒被摧毁，突击队将畅通无阻地清理每一层，直到无一活口。遵循最现代技术易受原始战争武器攻击的箴言，桑德森还布置了其他几枚炸弹，以瘫痪大部分第三新东京市的防御系统，包括防空炮、导弹发射井、传感器阵列、雷达天线罩、通信塔和远程控制的装甲门。

How he managed to sneak them inside? It was planned in advance several months ago, and on weekends he slipped the explosives across by using one of the abandoned passageways leading from the outside into the complex. With the use of blueprints he stole from one of the engineers responsible for the Geofront's upkeep, he located several of these Achilles' heels and installed the bombs.  
他是如何将它们偷偷带进去的？这一切早在几个月前就计划好了，每逢周末，他便利用一条从外部通向基地的废弃通道，悄悄将炸药运入。借助他从负责地表维护的工程师那里偷来的蓝图，他找到了几个关键弱点并安装了炸弹。

With one last detonator affixed into the block of Semtex, Sanderson switched on the receiver. A red LED light blinked repeatedly, telling him that the receiver was ready to accept the detonation code from a trigger transmitter disguised as a mint dispenser.  
桑德森将最后一个引爆器固定在塞姆汀炸药块上，打开了接收器。红色的 LED 灯不断闪烁，告诉他接收器已准备好接收伪装成薄荷糖盒的触发发射器的引爆代码。

The mole sighed as he packed away his gear, and thought of what to do with the Second Children.  
间谍叹了口气，收拾好装备，思考着该如何处置第二适格者。

_That little girl could wait,_ he decided, yet he had an idea. _Why don't I kill two birds with one stone?_  
那个小女孩可以等一等，他决定，不过他有个主意。何不来个一石二鸟？

---

Once Rei was finished changing back to her usual school pinafore, the casual clothes she would be using later tonight were packed in a plastic bag, along with the book she and Asuka had borrowed. As she came out of the bathroom, the other Children were talking as they were waiting.  
当丽换回她平常的校服裙后，她今晚要穿的便服和与明日香借的书一起被装进了塑料袋。当她从浴室出来时，其他孩子们正在等待时交谈着。

"Well," Shinji said, "I don't know what else to do… You got any ideas?" he questioned Asuka.  
“嗯，”真嗣说，“我不知道还能做什么……你有什么主意吗？”他问明日香。

"Yeah, dummy," Asuka retorted humorously before laughing. "Why don't we go online and chat with Hikari?" she suggested, pointing out at the desktop computer nearby. "You haven't got a chance to talk since… When?"  
"是啊，傻瓜，" 明日香幽默地反驳后笑了起来。"我们为什么不上线和光聊聊天呢？" 她提议道，指着附近的台式电脑。"你自从……什么时候就没机会和她说话了？"

"Two days ago, I think. When we dropped off Pen-Pen."  
"我想是两天前吧。我们送企鹅 Pen-Pen 回去的时候。"

"Ah," the redhead said as she walked over to the computer and switched it on.  
"啊，" 红发女孩说着走向电脑并打开了它。

"Guess we have go now," Kaworu said, his hand holding Rei's as the door slid open. "We'll see you later."  
"看来我们得走了，" 渚薰说道，他的手握着绫波的手，门缓缓打开。"待会儿见。"

The other two Children waved their hands in unison. "No problem," Shinji said while Asuka plopped down on a seat in front of the computer. Once the door closed, Asuka turned her attention to the young man.  
另外两个孩子齐刷刷地挥了挥手。"没问题，" 真嗣说道，而明日香则一屁股坐在电脑前的座位上。门一关上，明日香就把注意力转向了那个年轻人。

"What you two were talking about back there?" she asked as the PC booted to life. "In the spa?"  
"你们俩刚才在那儿聊什么呢？" 她问道，电脑启动了起来。"在温泉里？"

"Uh… He talked about himself, and then a few questions."  
"呃… 他谈到了自己，然后问了几个问题。"

Asuka cocked an eye. "About what?"  
明日香眯起一只眼睛。"关于什么？"

Shinji sighed. "About what we did yesterday, then we talked about betrayal… That's all." _Can't say much,_ he thought, _I'm afraid you might think I'm kind of-_  
真嗣叹了口气。"关于我们昨天做的事，然后我们谈到了背叛… 就这些。" 不能说太多，他想，我怕你会觉得我有点-

"Philosophy," Asuka muttered before she opened an instant messenger and logged in.  
“哲学，”明日香喃喃自语，随即打开了一个即时通讯软件并登录。

Back at Ritsuko's lab, sitting on one of the chairs, Misato's mind was whirling with all the revelations they had just heard twenty minutes ago.  
回到律子的实验室，坐在其中一把椅子上，美里脑海中充斥着二十分钟前刚刚听到的所有惊人真相。

As she watched Ritsuko pore over the backlog of work on her computer, trying to address them all, Misato wondered when they could make the next move. The first problem they have to deal with was Commander Ikari and Adam in his possession.  
看着律子埋头于电脑前，努力处理堆积如山的工作，美里思索着他们何时才能采取下一步行动。他们首先要解决的问题是碇司令和他手中的亚当。

Misato groaned in frustration; Ikari was still in control, no matter how distant he was. Although Fuyutsuki sometimes acted as a deputy while Ikari was in absence, the Commander still had full control of the division heads within the organization, including the Second Section, and thus he could countermand any orders Fuyutsuki may issue.  
美里懊恼地叹息；无论碇司令多么疏远，他依然掌控着全局。虽然副司令冬月有时会在碇司令不在时担任代理，但司令仍对组织内的各部门负责人拥有绝对控制权，包括第二课，因此他可以否决冬月下达的任何命令。

Now it came to this: how they could stop Ikari from attempting to do the unthinkable? How they could pull Adam away from him? It was tantamount to a mutiny, and if they got caught she knew damn well the penalties are severe.  
如今问题摆在眼前：他们如何阻止碇司令尝试那不可想象之事？如何从他手中夺走亚当？这无异于一场叛变，一旦被发现，她深知后果将极其严重。

Worse, if Third Impact was to occur and they were all in jail, they would have little to do except to wait for the end to come.  
更糟的是，如果第三次冲击发生时他们都被关在监狱里，除了等待末日降临，他们将无事可做。

But then she recalled what Fuyutsuki said about Hamamoto: if they could convince the Second Section director to defect to their side, it would give them a solid advantage, nullify Ikari's authority as Commander, and thus the entire NERV security apparatus would also be under their authority; once that control is established, the defense of the organization would be made possible.  
但她随即想起了冬月关于浜本的话：如果能说服第二课课长倒戈，将给他们带来稳固的优势，削弱碇司令的权威，从而整个 NERV 的安全机构也将落入他们手中；一旦掌控确立，组织的防御便能得以实施。

Misato sighed, realizing that all that would ride on a lot of factors and the best timing; they have to find the chink in the Commander's armor, and determine when or where he could lower his defense.  
美里叹了口气，意识到这一切将取决于诸多因素和最佳时机；他们必须找到司令的软肋，并确定何时何地他能放松警惕。

She asked, _What is the Commander's greatest weakness?_  
"她问道：“司令最大的弱点是什么？”

---

More than a hundred kilometers away from where Misato was sitting, in Tokyo-2 Hikari was sitting right in front of a computer, chatting with her classmates through the IM, fellow refugees who were once Tokyo-3 residents.  
距离美里所在之处一百多公里外的东京-2，光正坐在电脑前，通过即时通讯软件与同学们聊天，这些同学都是曾经的东京-3 居民，如今一同流离失所。

Apart from her, Toji was helping Mari with her homework on the mat in the middle of the living room, discussing the intricacies of the multiplication table, while Kensuke was busy dodging missiles and jinking his plane in a round of _Ace Combat 8_ on the Xbox 720. As usual, Hikari's sisters were out for shopping in downtown.  
除了光之外，真嗣正在客厅的垫子上帮助玛丽做作业，讨论乘法表的复杂之处，而健介则在 Xbox 720 上忙着在《皇牌空战 8》中躲避导弹并操纵飞机进行机动。一如既往，光的姐妹们外出到市中心购物去了。

Hikari was almost done talking to some of the other girls when a pop-up box told her that Asuka was online. Excited, she clicked on it and typed in the chat box:  
光几乎与一些其他女孩聊完时，一个弹出窗口告诉她明日香上线了。她兴奋地点击进入，并在聊天框中输入：

_Hikari-chan: Hey sis what took you so long?  
光莉酱：嘿，姐姐，你怎么这么久才来？  
ASLangley: sorry I was busy thru the whole morning  
AS 兰利：抱歉，整个上午我都很忙。  
Hikari-chan: what do you mean?  
光莉酱：你这是什么意思？  
ASLangley: I'm back in business. Unit 2 is mine again.  
ASLangley: 我又回来了。二号机再次属于我了。_

Suddenly Hikari blinked, her brain exclaiming: _Oh, my God, she's back!_  
突然，光眨了眨眼，脑海中惊呼：哦，天哪，她回来了！

_Hikari-chan: OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG CONGRATULATIONS! You did it!  
光酱：OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG 恭喜恭喜！你做到了！  
Hikari-chan: YES YES YES  
ASLangley: calm down everything's all rite. Just turn on the webcam cause I have Shinji with me  
ASLangley: 冷静点，一切都没事。打开摄像头吧，我和真嗣在一起呢。  
Hikari-chan: you do? 光莉酱：真的吗？  
ASLangley: yeah_

Hikari turned her attention to her companions around the room and hollered, "Hey, Asuka's online right now! With SHINJI!"  
光莉将注意力转向房间里的同伴们，大声喊道：“嘿，明日香现在在线！和真嗣在一起！”

In an instant, Kensuke dropped his controller, Toji and Mari stood up, and Pen-Pen came dashing from the kitchen. Once they all huddled around the computer, Hikari turned on the webcam and the speaker. Onscreen and through the cam window, they can now see Asuka sitting with Shinji besides her, which was a pleasant surprise, prompting Kensuke and Toji to make a congratulatory high-five: _Shinji's the man, all right!_  
刹那间，健介放下了手柄，真嗣和玛丽站了起来，而企鹅潘-潘则从厨房冲了出来。当他们全都围在电脑旁时，光打开了网络摄像头和扬声器。屏幕上和摄像头窗口中，他们现在可以看到明日香坐在真嗣旁边，这让他们惊喜不已，健介和真嗣不禁击掌庆祝：真嗣真是好样的！

With the microphone on, Hikari asked, "Hi there, how are you doing this time?"  
打开麦克风，光问道：“嗨，这次你们怎么样？”

"I'm all right," Shinji replied, his voice almost garbled by the long transmission and the data compression.  
“我还好，”真嗣回答，他的声音几乎被长距离传输和数据压缩弄得含糊不清。

"Uh, I notice that you two are holding hands. Are you two steady now?"  
"呃，我注意到你们俩在牵手。你们现在是稳定关系了吗？"

Asuka and Shinji nodded in unison, reminding them of the synchronization exercise both Children did months ago. The reply prompted Hikari and everyone else to laugh and cheer; even Pen-Pen was squawking loudly, making a happy dance with waving flippers.  
明日香和真嗣齐齐点头，这让他们想起了几个月前两个孩子进行的同步训练。这个回答让光和在场的其他人笑了起来，欢呼雀跃；就连 Pen-Pen 也在大声叫着，挥动着鳍足跳起了快乐的舞蹈。

"When?" she asked. "什么时候？" 她问道。

"Yesterday," Asuka said. "We finally made up our minds." From there both Children began to recount everything that transpired since the last time Asuka talked to Hikari: the ambush, the assassination attempt, the successful synchronization test, and above all, how they hit it off.  
“昨天，”明日香说道，“我们终于下定了决心。”从那开始，两位少年开始讲述自上次明日香与光见面以来发生的一切：伏击、暗杀企图、成功的同步测试，以及最重要的是，他们是如何一拍即合的。

"…and there, I realized that we were the same," Asuka said. "Like as if somehow we've been put together by destiny."  
“……在那里，我意识到我们是一样的，”明日香说，“就好像我们是被命运安排在一起的。”

"But…" Hikari trailed off, "Why, why someone would want you dead?"  
“但是……”光犹豫了一下，“为什么，为什么会有人想要你死？”

Asuka shook her head. "I'm not sure, except it happens that I'm too important. Because of that, the whole base is in yellow alert."  
明日香摇了摇头。“我不确定，只是碰巧我太重要了。正因为如此，整个基地都处于黄色警戒状态。”

The whole gang looked glum, before Hikari said, "I hope Misato is keeping a good eye on you, yet I know you can still fight."  
整个团队看起来都很沮丧，然后光子说：“我希望美里能好好看着你，但我知道你仍然能战斗。”

"I'll kill again if necessary," Asuka replied, flexing her right hand. "I know what to do should that happens once more."  
“如果有必要，我会再次杀人，”明日香回答，活动了一下右手。“如果再发生那种情况，我知道该怎么做。”

"I made a promise to myself," Shinji added. "I promised since yesterday that I'll protect Asuka with everything I have."  
"我对自己许下了一个承诺，" 真嗣补充道。"从昨天起我就发誓，要用尽一切力量保护明日香。"

"Now that's profound, buddy," Toji said.  
"这话说得有深度，兄弟，" 东治说道。"

"Hey," Kensuke budged in. "How did you know you were able to shoot? That was damn cool of you."  
"嘿，" 健介插话进来。"你怎么知道自己能射击的？那真是帅呆了。"

Shinji snickered, proud of what he did yesterday on the road. "You taught me, remember? When I ran away, am I right?"  
真嗣窃笑，对自己昨天在路上做的事感到自豪。“你教过我的，记得吗？我逃跑的时候，对吧？”

Kensuke now recalled how he instructed Shinji on how to use a gun. "Damn right," he agreed with a big grin. "I'm so proud of you, soldier," he added, mimicking the voice of an action star in a commando movie, before throwing a salute at Shinji.  
剑介现在回想起了他是如何教真嗣使用枪的。“当然没错，”他咧嘴笑着同意道。“我真为你骄傲，士兵，”他补充道，模仿着一部突击队电影中动作明星的口吻，然后向真嗣敬了个礼。

"Thanks," Shinji said, laughing softly. "Well, Toji," he added, "by the way, how's your arm?"  
“谢谢，”真嗣轻声笑着说。“对了，东治，”他接着说，“顺便问一下，你的手臂怎么样了？”

Toji raised his still-bandaged stump that was once his left arm. "It's healing well," he answered. "But Doctor Odani recommended me to a specialist at the Tokyo-2 University who might help me with an experimental treatment."  
冬二举起他那仍缠着绷带的残肢，那曾是他的左臂。“愈合得很好，”他回答道，“但医生小谷推荐我去东京-2 大学找一位专家，他可能会帮我进行一种实验性治疗。”

"What treatment?" Shinji asked while Asuka blinked.  
“什么治疗？”真嗣问道，而明日香眨了眨眼。

"Uh…" Toji said, trying to recall what his new doctor told him. "It's called ECM, and it's from America; they said by having multiple treatments of the stuff, I might soon grow a new arm and a leg, and maybe even a hand."  
“呃……”冬二努力回忆着新医生告诉他的话，“叫做 ECM，是从美国来的；他们说通过多次治疗，我可能很快就能长出一条新胳膊和一条腿，甚至可能还有一只手。”

Asuka and Shinji pitched forward, as though they couldn't believe it. "What?" both Children asked together, before Toji explained the details; basically ECM involved using an enzyme that promotes regeneration of any living tissue, and so far previous clinical tests showed that continued treatment allowed lost limbs or body parts to be rebuilt literally from the ground up.  
明日香和真嗣向前倾身，仿佛难以置信。“什么？”两个孩子异口同声地问道，随后冬二解释了细节；基本上，ECM 涉及使用一种促进任何活体组织再生的酶，迄今为止的临床试验表明，持续治疗可以使失去的肢体或身体部位从零开始重建。

"Don't worry, I'll be fine through all that," Toji said. "NERV is still sending the medical compensation paychecks in the mail, so I don't have to worry much about the costs; each treatment costs as much as a small car, but it'll be cheaper since the experiment is funded privately."  
“别担心，我会没事的，”冬二说。“NERV 仍在通过邮寄方式发送医疗补偿支票，所以我不用担心费用问题；每次治疗费用相当于一辆小型汽车，但由于实验是私人资助的，所以会更便宜。”

The two other Children sighed in relief; Toji will be all right, and by the middle of next year, they guessed that he would be able to go back playing basketball on a regular basis, without having to carry the prosthesis all the time.  
另外两个孩子松了口气；冬二会没事的，他们猜测到明年中旬，他就能恢复正常打篮球，不再需要一直携带假肢了。

"That's very good," Asuka praised. "But, sis, what's hanging with you two?"  
"那很好，" 明日香称赞道。"不过，姐姐，你们俩在忙什么呢？"

"Other than Toji's medical," Hikari said, "there's nothing else to worry about here. I've been teaching him how to cook."  
"除了真嗣的医疗问题，" 光说，"这里没什么好担心的。我一直在教他做饭。"

Asuka chuckled. "He should be, and Toji, should you serve what you cook, don't give me an upset stomach, okay?"  
明日香轻笑。"他应该学，还有真嗣，要是你做的菜端上来，别让我肚子不舒服，好吗？"

Toji nodded. "All right, but don't call me a blockhead for nothing," he replied, before laughing and added, "Seriously, I'll learn much from her."  
冬二点点头。“好吧，但别无缘无故叫我傻瓜。”他笑着补充道，“说真的，我会从她那里学到很多。”

"Good," Shinji said. "That'll make you a fine husband someday."  
“很好，”真嗣说，“这样你将来会成为一个好丈夫的。”

"You bet," Toji replied, but Hikari playfully elbowed him, prompting to grimace for a second.  
"“当然，”冬二回答，但光子俏皮地用肘撞了他一下，让他瞬间皱了皱眉。”

There was a moment to let it all sink in before Kensuke asked Shinji, "How long do you think you're going to make it through?"  
有那么一会儿，让这一切都沉入心底，然后真希问真嗣：“你觉得你能撑多久？”

Shinji shrugged. "I don't know, and I'm not sure how long this'll last, but we're trying."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我不知道，也不确定这会持续多久，但我们正在努力。”

Asuka nodded, and she said, "If ever things come to worse, we'll rush in with guns blazing; nobody will gonna dispute us with an AT-Field and ten thousand layers of armor."  
明日香点头道：“如果情况变得更糟，我们会带着枪冲进去；没有人能用 AT 力场和一万层装甲来反驳我们。”

Rented from the Pyramid's main lobby, the twenty-six-incher utility mountain bike had a basket on the handlebars, and a baggage pallet on the rear, which would allow Rei to ride on the back. Kaworu said, "I can ride this, but this is how you sit here." He demonstrated it by sitting sideways on the pallet.  
从金字塔的主大厅租来的二十六英寸多功能山地自行车，车把上装有篮子，后部还有一个行李托板，可以让丽坐在后面。渚说：“我可以骑这辆车，但你要这样坐。”他通过侧坐在托板上示范了坐法。

Rei nodded. "I have never ridden a bicycle," she said.  
丽点点头。“我从未骑过自行车，”她说。

"Don't worry," Kaworu reassured. "Try to hold my waist as I drive, okay? I'll sit first, and then you go there." He took the backpack off and handed it over to Rei, who strapped it onto her body; he brought the backpack with them, containing everything what he needed just in case, including his well-disguised communication equipment... and, of course, the copy of _Twilight_ that she and Asuka had borrowed from the library.  
“别担心，”渚安慰道。“试着在我骑车时扶住我的腰，好吗？我先坐上去，然后你再坐。”他脱下背包递给丽，她将其系在身上；他们带着背包，里面装有他所需的一切，包括他巧妙伪装的通讯设备……当然，还有她和明日香从图书馆借来的《暮光之城》。

Kaworu then sat down on the saddle, and as instructed, Rei placed herself on the pallet, sitting sideways before she held onto Kaworu's waist.  
カヲルは鞍に座り、指示に従ってレイがパレットに横に座り、カヲルの腰を抱きかかえた。

"Now, hold tight," he said as he started to pedal forward, trying to keep the bike balanced as they got off the pavement and hit the trail.  
「じゃあ、しっかりつかまって」と彼は前にペダルを踏み始め、自転車をバランスを保ちながら舗装路からトレイルに乗り出した。

The next few minutes were quiet, as Kaworu glided the bike smoothly on the three-kilometer-long trail, going under the pine trees, the tires crunching on the dried leaves and grass. Once in a while an obstacle in a form of a large rock came upon them, and he had to make a careful swerve to avoid it, but Rei had to clasp her arms and hands tighter each time it happened.  
次の数分間は静かで、カヲルは自転車を3キロのトレイル上で滑らかに進め、松の木の下を通り抜け、タイヤが枯れ葉と草を踏みしめた。時々大きな岩が障害となって現れ、慎重に回避する必要がありましたが、レイはそのたびに腕と手をもっとしっかりと組みかかえなければなりませんでした。

As he pedaled, Kaworu felt better satisfaction of being out in the woods, breathing in the air, much better than the air-conditioned and filtered atmosphere down at Central Dogma. His ears were alert, hearing the chirping from a family of birds in their nest; and insects buzzing their mating calls.  
当他骑着自行车时，碇真嗣感受到了在森林中呼吸新鲜空气的更大满足感，这远比中央教条区空调过滤后的环境要好得多。他的耳朵警觉地捕捉到了鸟巢中一家鸟儿的鸣叫声，以及昆虫们发出求偶的嗡嗡声。

"What do you think?" Kaworu asked Rei, who was still holding on.  
“你觉得怎么样？”碇真嗣问绫波，她依然紧紧抓着。

"Again, this is new to me," she answered, referring to her very first bike ride.  
“再次强调，这对我是全新的体验，”她回答道，指的是她第一次骑自行车的经历。

Kaworu chuckled; he was pleased to hear Rei experiencing something new with him.  
渚薰轻声笑了；听到绫波与他一同体验新事物，他感到很高兴。

Once they arrived, with Rei getting off first before Kaworu set the bike down, two things came up to his mind, dredging memories of Misato and Shinji, the first being the message from Kaji on the answering machine, through Misato's ears:  
一到目的地，绫波先下了车，随后渚薰停好摩托车，两件事涌上心头，勾起了对美里和真嗣的回忆，第一件是卡兹在答录机上的留言，通过美里的耳朵传来：

"_Misato, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message, after I caused you so much trouble. Sorry. Please tell Ritsuko that I'm really sorry. And there's one more thing to trouble you with: I've been growing flowers. I'd appreciate it if you could water the flowers for me. Shinji knows where they are. The truth is with you. Don't hesitate. Just move ahead!"_  
“美里，是我。我确信你正在听这条留言，在我给你惹了这么多麻烦之后。对不起。请告诉律子，我真的很抱歉。还有一件事要麻烦你：我一直在种花。如果你能帮我浇花，我将不胜感激。真嗣知道它们在哪里。真相在你手中。不要犹豫。只管前进！”

_There was a second of hesitation before Kaji spoke again.  
片刻犹豫后，加持再次开口。_

"_If I can see you again, I promise that I will say the words that I couldn't say to you eight years ago. Bye."_  
"如果还能再见你一面，我承诺我会说出八年前未能对你说出口的话。再见。"

The second came from Shinji's memories, through his eyes:  
第二件来自真嗣的记忆，通过他的眼睛：

"_Shinji?" Kaji asked as he had the hose in his hand, watering the patch while anti-personnel gun batteries were trying to blast the Angel away with tracers and cannon shells. Missiles could also be seen flying away, before they exploded on the Angel's AT-Field._  
"真嗣？" 加持手里拿着水管，一边浇灌着花坛，一边看着反人员炮台用曳光弹和炮弹试图轰走使徒。导弹也能看到飞出，随后在使徒的 AT 力场爆炸。

_Shinji, exhausted from running at full tilt, in ragged breaths, was just as surprised to see him here. "Kaji," he said. "What are you doing in a place like this?"  
真嗣全速奔跑后筋疲力尽，喘着粗气，看到他在这里同样感到惊讶。"加持先生，"他说，"你怎么会来这种地方？"_

_Kaji shrugged. "That's my line, and what are you doing?"  
加持耸了耸肩。"这话该我问你，你在这里做什么？"_

_Shinji looked morose. "I… I won't pilot Unit One anymore, since I decided that..." he trailed off as he watched the Angel unfurl its destructive ribbons and proceeded to slash at the Pyramid.  
真嗣看起来忧郁。“我……我不会再驾驶初号机了，既然我已经决定了……”他一边说着，一边看着使徒展开其毁灭性的缎带，开始切割金字塔。_

_The stubble-faced agent cocked his head. "Uh-huh? Since my cover had been blown, I lost my command position in the perimeter defense, and so I've been busy taking care of the watermelons."  
那位胡茬脸的特工歪了歪头。“嗯哼？自从我的伪装被揭穿后，我就失去了外围防御的指挥权，所以我现在忙着照顾西瓜。”_

_The boy frowned. "At a crazy time like this?"  
男孩皱起眉头。“在这种疯狂的时候？”_

_Kaji laughed as the water splashed on the leaves. "Because it's a good time like this," he said. "Though I'd rather be in Katusragi's boobs, I'd like to be here when I die."  
加治笑了起来，水花溅在叶子上。“因为像这样美好的时刻，”他说，“虽然我更愿意死在葛城小姐的怀里，但我希望自己能在这里死去。”_

_Shinji blinked twice. "Die? Why?"  
真嗣眨了两次眼。“死？为什么？”_

_The agent sighed. "They say that when an Angel comes into contact with Adam, sleeping underground here, all humanity will be annihilated," Kaji warned. "That cataclysm will be Third Impact, yet it can only be stopped by an Evangelion, which has the same power as an Angel."  
特工叹了口气。“据说当使徒接触到沉睡在地下的亚当，全人类都将被毁灭，”加治警告道，“那场灾难将是第三次冲击，然而只有拥有与使徒相同力量的 EVA 才能阻止它。”_

_Suddenly, without warning Unit-00 burst out of one of the huge gates, carrying an N2-tipped ICBM in her remaining arm as she ran.  
突然，毫无预警地，零号机从一座巨大的闸门中冲了出来，她仅存的手臂上携带着一枚装有 N2 弹头的洲际弹道导弹，疾速奔跑着。_

_Shinji was shocked. "Ayanami! What she's doing without a rifle?"  
真嗣震惊了。“绫波！她没有步枪在做什么？”_

_Unit-00 began firing up her AT-Field to full power, as Shinji could imagine Rei in the Entry Plug, struggling to get the missile close to the Angel's core. But much to her misfortune, the Angel quickly covered its core with a rocky armor shortly before the N2 warhead detonated with a near-blinding blast, causing Shinji and Kaji to instinctively drop down to the ground, covering themselves before the shockwave hit them both with a wall of air.  
零号机开始全力展开她的 AT 力场，真嗣可以想象驾驶舱内的绫波正竭力将导弹靠近使徒的核心。但不幸的是，使徒迅速用岩石装甲覆盖了核心，就在 N2 弹头爆炸产生近乎致盲的闪光之前，真嗣和加持本能地趴在地上，用身体保护自己，以免被冲击波带来的气墙击中。_

_And at the same time the Angel unleashed its ribbon blades at Unit-00 and flung her out with her limbs and body in tatters.  
与此同时，使徒释放了它的缎带刀刃，向零号机袭来，将她击飞，四肢和身体支离破碎。_

_Both men breathed deeply, trying to recover themselves as they stood up slowly. Kaji flicked off the dirt on his chest and face, before he said, "Shinji, I have little else to do but tend these melons here. But for you, I bet there is something which you can do and only you can do. Nobody is forcing you. Think for yourself and decide by yourself... what you should do now. Well, I hope you have nothing to regret."  
两人深呼吸着，试图慢慢站起身来恢复状态。加持掸去胸前和脸上的尘土，然后说道：“真嗣，我在这里除了照料这些西瓜也没别的事了。但对你来说，我相信有件事只有你能做。没有人强迫你。自己思考，自己决定……你现在应该做什么。嗯，我希望你不要有任何遗憾。”_

"So this is the place," Kaworu said to Rei, as they stood before the watermelon patch, now almost overrun by weeks of weeds, covering the vines and the fruits. Not far away was a wooden shack, probably containing gardening tools inside. Apparently the patch was once part of a bigger fruit and vegetable garden, presumably to sustain construction workers and technicians with fresh produce while they built and equipped NERV headquarters from the beginning.  
“原来这就是那个地方，”渚薰对绫波说，他们站在几乎被数周杂草淹没的西瓜地前，杂草覆盖了藤蔓和果实。不远处有一个木棚，里面可能存放着园艺工具。显然，这块地曾经是一个更大的水果和蔬菜园的一部分，大概是为了在建造和装备 NERV 总部时为工人和技术人员提供新鲜农产品。

"What we should do first?" Rei asked.  
"我们应该先做什么？" 丽问道。

Kaworu shrugged. "Since my guardian taught me how to do it, let's pull out the weeds first before we water."  
渚耸了耸肩。"既然我的监护人教过我怎么做，那我们先拔掉杂草再浇水吧。"

Rei nodded as they walked over to the patch and began uprooting the weeds from the ground, teaching her as they went. The process took some time, staining their hands as they cleared every square meter until they had a fine pile of weeds right besides the patch.  
丽点点头，他们走到那片地前，开始从地上拔除杂草，边拔边教她。这个过程花了些时间，他们的手沾满了泥土，直到每平方米都清理干净，旁边堆起了一堆杂草。

"Well," Kaworu said as he flicked his hands clean, "What do you think? It looks better, right?"  
"嗯，" 渚薰一边弹干净手上的灰尘，一边说道，"你觉得怎么样？看起来好多了，对吧？"

"Yes," Rei answered. "They will grow better, now that their patch is clear."  
"是的，" 绫波零回答，"现在这块地清理干净了，它们会长得更好。"

"Guess it's time to do what we came here for," Kaworu replied as he located the faucet and the coiled hose. He picked up the nozzled end of the hose and opened the faucet; once water came out he first washed his hands, before he asked Rei to come over and let him wash hers.  
"看来是时候做我们来的目的了，" 渚薰找到水龙头和卷起的软管，回答道。他拿起软管带喷嘴的一端，打开水龙头；水流出来后，他先洗了洗手，然后让绫波零过来，帮她也洗了洗手。"

Once that was done, he began to spray gently in a slow arc.  
完成这一步后，他开始轻轻地以缓慢的弧线喷洒。

Rei watched Kaworu water the plants, the drizzle landing on the leaves, water accumulating into droplets, before dripping away onto the ground, bringing moisture to the otherwise-parched soil.  
丽看着薰给植物浇水，细雨落在叶子上，水珠逐渐积聚，然后滴落到地上，为原本干涸的土壤带来湿润。

"I regret that I…" Rei trailed off, "I have not done something like this before."  
“我很遗憾……”丽停顿了一下，“我以前从未做过这样的事。”

"Like gardening?" Kaworu asked, still aiming the nozzle like a careful brush stroke on canvas.  
“喜欢园艺吗？” 渚薰问道，依旧像在画布上精心描绘一般拿着喷嘴。

Rei quietly nodded. 绫波静静地点了点头。

Kaworu chuckled. "You know," he said, "It amazes me to no end that you still have much more to discover about this world, things that you and I have yet to see and experience… and things that we could learn from. In my case, it's also a learning experience for me.  
"渚薰轻声笑了。“你知道，”他说，“令我无比惊讶的是，你还有许多关于这个世界的新事物等待发现，那些你我尚未见过和体验过的…以及我们可以从中学习的东西。对我来说，这也是一种学习经历。”

"Oh, I learned much from Shinji. Or Asuka. Or Misato. Even from Doctor Akagi. Why? Despite their weaknesses, somehow the lilim have the capacity to forgive themselves and others for the sins they commit, and maybe even the ability to stick to their promises to be better persons in the future… which is another reason why I have made up my mind to let the lilim live.  
“哦，我从真嗣那里学到了很多。还有明日香、美里，甚至是赤木律子博士。为什么呢？尽管他们有弱点，不知为何，莉莉姆们有能力原谅自己和他人所犯的罪行，甚至可能拥有坚守承诺，在未来成为更好的人的能力……这也是我下定决心让莉莉姆们活下去的另一个原因。”

"Now, I don't want to hurt Shinji. I don't want to, because he's the most vulnerable of all, and I'm trying to respect his feelings, and to build some confidence in him, because you and I know that... Forgive me, but things at the end will be very ugly for all of us."  
“现在，我不想伤害真嗣。我不想，因为他是最脆弱的一个，我正努力尊重他的感受，并试图在他心中建立一些信心，因为你知道……原谅我，但最终对我们所有人来说都会非常糟糕。”

Kaworu shook his head and sighed. "Why would a lilim try to reinvent the world they live in? For what purpose? Purity? Nirvana? Infinite and false happiness at the expense of giving no one the chance to decide their own fates?"  
渚薰摇了摇头，叹息道：“为什么一个莉莉姆会试图重塑他们生活的世界？为了什么目的？纯洁？涅槃？以牺牲不给任何人决定自己命运的机会为代价，换取无限而虚假的幸福？”

The young man walked back to the faucet and shut off the water, before he rose and proclaimed, "I am not a god; I am a servant, just as you do. Yet as we're individuals, we still have the right to decide the fate of the world we exist in."  
年轻人走回水龙头旁，关上了水，然后站起身来宣称：“我不是神；我和你们一样，只是个仆人。然而，作为个体，我们仍有权利决定我们所存在的世界的命运。”

Rei approached him and she said, "I have made my decision."  
丽走向他，说道：“我已经做出了我的决定。”

Kaworu blinked. "What is it?"  
薰眨了眨眼。“是什么？”

"I will fight," Rei decided, "should someone think you are wrong, should someone harm Ikari or Soryu, and I will fight for those connections that make me what I am. Like you I have no regret; you gave me eyes when I was blind; a tongue when I was mute; and an ear when I was deaf."  
“我会战斗，”丽决定道，“如果有人认为你错了，如果有人伤害碇或惣流，我会为那些塑造了我的联系而战。就像你一样，我无怨无悔；你在我失明时给了我眼睛；在我沉默时给了我舌头；在我耳聋时给了我耳朵。”

Rei slowly took Kaworu's hands and cradled them to hers. "Just when I thought I am an empty entity, devoid of life, expendable and worthless…" she trailed off. "By chance, you have come here to make me a better person."  
丽缓缓握住渚薰的手，将它们捧在自己的手中。“就在我以为自己是一个空洞的存在，没有生命，可有可无，毫无价值……”她停了下来。“偶然间，你来到这里，让我成为一个更好的人。”

The girl looked up to the boy's eyes and added, "I do not care should we be punished by the Commander; if he wills us to die, then we will not… For I love you… Because we will fight to live…"  
女孩抬头望向男孩的眼睛，补充道：“我不在乎我们是否会受到司令的惩罚；如果他希望我们死去，那么我们不会……因为我爱你……因为我们将会为生存而战……”

"As one," Kaworu whispered, before they leaned to each other and began to kiss.  
"齐心协力，"渚薰低语道，随后他们倾身相向，开始亲吻。

---

"Hey," Hikari asked Asuka, "I forgot to mention about your new friend Kaworu."  
"嘿，" 美里问明日香，"我忘了提你的新朋友渚薰了。"

Asuka and Shinji blinked. "Him?"  
明日香和真嗣眨了眨眼。"他？"

The gang was anticipating for an answer. "Where's he?" she said.  
大家都在期待一个答案。“他在哪儿？”她问道。

"He's with Ayanami right now," Shinji replied. "Gone to water Kaji's watermelon patch, and from there they'll head back to her apartment. They should be back tonight, just in time for a night out."  
“他现在和绫波在一起，”真嗣回答，“去给加持的西瓜地浇水了，然后他们会回她的公寓。今晚应该能回来，正好赶上出去玩。”

Disappointed, Hikari sighed. "It would've been interesting to talk to him for the first time… But, wait a second, what's up with those two?"  
光子失望地叹了口气。“第一次和他聊天会很有趣的……但是，等等，他们俩是怎么回事？”

Shinji laughed quietly. "They're in _love_."  
真嗣轻声笑道。“他们恋爱了。”

His friends all exclaimed in one voice: "WHAT?"  
他的朋友们齐声惊呼：“什么？”

"You should see them together and… You know what, Kensuke? He thawed her out, just as you have predicted."  
“你应该看看他们在一起的样子……你知道吗，健介？他让她变得温暖了，正如你之前预言的那样。”

"See, see, see! I am the undisputed strategist!" Kensuke proudly boasted, before Toji lightly slapped him over the head, and they all laughed.  
"看，看，看！我可是无可争议的策略家！" 真希波得意地夸耀道，随后被东治轻轻拍了一下头，大家都笑了起来。

"Oh, what about Misato?" Toji asked.  
"哦，那美里小姐呢？" 东治问道。

"Glad you mentioned her," Asuka said. "She's a lieutenant-colonel now, which is why tonight we're all going to the O-Club to celebrate."  
"很高兴你提到她，" 明日香说，"她现在已经是中校了，所以今晚我们要去 O-Club 庆祝一下。"

Kensuke was bug-eyed enough for his eyeball whites to fill his glasses. "Really? That's amazing!" he exclaimed. "Attaining two command ranks in less than two months! Well, how she got those new pins?"  
健介瞪大了眼睛，眼白几乎填满了他的眼镜。“真的吗？太惊人了！”他惊呼道，“不到两个月就获得了两个指挥级别！那么，她是怎么得到那些新徽章的？”

"Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki promoted her last night," Shinji said.  
“副指挥官冬月昨晚提拔了她，”真嗣说道。

Kensuke nodded. "Ah… That's damn cool because she kicked ass, but from there I'm sure she'll have a bigger workload to deal with."  
健介点点头。“啊……那确实很酷，因为她表现出色，但从那以后我敢肯定她会有更多的工作要处理。”

"I understand that," Shinji said. "It's just that she needed to move things quicker, 'cause back then she had trouble trying to put things in order."  
"我明白，" 真嗣说。"只是她需要加快进度，因为那时候她很难把事情理顺。"

As they were about to leave after kissing, while Rei picked up a watermelon for them to consume at her flat, as Kaworu walked over to the bicycle, sidestepping the vines and the melons, he stumbled to the ground.  
当他们准备离开并亲吻后，丽拿起一个西瓜准备带回她的公寓享用，而渚薰走向自行车，避开藤蔓和西瓜时，他绊倒了。

"I tripped on something," he said, wondering what his foot had found. With curiosity he sought for the object by parting away the vines and, feeling with his hands, found that it was a metal box measuring about six inches on all sides.  
"我被什么东西绊倒了，" 他说，好奇是什么东西绊住了他的脚。出于好奇，他拨开藤蔓，用手摸索，发现那是一个边长约六英寸的金属盒子。

"What is this?" Kaworu asked Rei.  
“这是什么？”渚薰问绫波。

"I do not know," she replied.  
“我不知道，”她回答道。

To answer that, using his fingers to grip the edges, Kaworu pulled the heavy box out of the ground and set it right besides the hole it made. He then brushed off the dirt and examined the top. Engraved into the metal was the name: "R. Kaji".  
为了回答这个问题，渚薰用手指抓住边缘，将沉重的箱子从地里拉出，放在它留下的坑旁边。然后他拂去泥土，仔细检查顶部。金属上刻着名字：“R. 加持”。

Kaworu blinked, realizing why Kaji gave out his last message on the answering machine: to tell Misato that he had hidden this box amongst the watermelons, and by watering the plants she could find what he had left for her.  
渚薰眨了眨眼，意识到加持为什么在答录机上留下最后一条信息：告诉美里他把这个盒子藏在了西瓜堆里，通过给植物浇水她就能找到他留给她的东西。

"The message made sense," Kaworu whispered as he tapped the sides with knuckles, and then he shook the box. With the brushing sound, there was something inside.  
“这条信息说得通，”渚薰低声说着，用指节敲了敲盒子的侧面，然后摇了摇。随着摩擦声，里面似乎有什么东西。

"Message?" Rei asked with interest.  
“信息？”绫波零感兴趣地问道。

"You see, shortly before he was killed Kaji left Misato with a message, but really a clue, but she didn't know that she could find this box here. Obviously this message was his last will and testament for her to act on."  
"你看，在他被杀前不久，加持留给美里一条信息，实际上是个线索，但她当时并不知道能在这里找到这个盒子。显然，这条信息是他留给她的最后遗愿和遗嘱，让她据此行动。"

"What does it contain?"  
"里面装的是什么？"

Kaworu shrugged as he hefted the box and carried it over near the bicycle. "I have no idea unless we bring this later to Misato. Who knows, this could be very important for her."  
渚耸了耸肩，他提起盒子，把它搬到自行车附近。“我不清楚，除非我们稍后带给美里。谁知道呢，这可能对她非常重要。”

**Author's Notes:** After what seemed to be a very agonizing week, I have delivered. Again. Because I found my flow tonight, and everything's all right!  
作者的话：经过似乎异常煎熬的一周，我终于完成了。又一次。因为今晚我找到了灵感，一切都好起来了！

Now, with this chapter done with, I have started on a new fanfic project for another fandom – _Maria-sama ga Miteru_ – and it's called _Nineteen_. That's right, it's a new series that I hope would bring a new genre of action and suspense in a sea of one-shot shipping romances, something I need to shake up the tree. (chuckles) Like _Light and Water,_ each chapter of _Nineteen_ will be produced on a weekly basis.  
现在，随着这篇《一千零一夜》的完成，我开始了一个新的同人项目——《玛莉亚的凝望》，名为《十九》。没错，这是一部新系列，我希望它能带来一种新的动作悬疑风格，打破一众短篇恋爱故事的海洋，我需要给这棵树带来些新意。（轻笑）就像《光与水》一样，《十九》的每一章都将每周定期更新。

For the past few months, ever since my brother-in-law had set up an internet connection, it was good to be online, but at the price of wasting some precious time that I would otherwise devote to brainstorming and writing. Now that I have realized my mistake, I decided to manage my time wisely, while knowing how much my in-law is paying for the electricity.  
过去几个月，自从姐夫安装了网络连接后，虽然上网很愉快，但代价是浪费了一些本应用于头脑风暴和写作的宝贵时间。现在我意识到了错误，决定明智地管理时间，同时了解姐夫为电费支付了多少。

Finally, next week I'll turn 34 on Friday, but the fight's not over yet. Not until I win my freedom.  
终于，下周我将在周五迎来 34 岁生日，但战斗尚未结束。直到我赢得自由之前，一切都不算完。

Until then, tune in for the next installment of _Light and Water._ Thank you, and keep sending me your comments and criticisms; I need them both to make sure I maintain the quality of my storytelling.  
在此之前，请继续关注《光与水》的下一集。感谢大家，并请继续给我发送你们的评论和批评；我需要它们来确保我的故事质量得以维持。

OBTW... Better prepare for **Season Three**...  
顺便一提... 准备好迎接第三季吧...

As Strike Fiss once put in the end of every chapter of _Higher Learning:_ Khattam-shud!  
正如斯特里克·菲斯在每一部《高等学府》系列的结尾所言：卡塔姆-舒德！

Hamamoto was poring over several reports, most of which concerning the ongoing hunt for the mole. So far his men managed to locate suspicious phone numbers somewhere in Germany, yet despite all their efforts have not yet been able to produce any names.  
Hamamoto 正埋头研究几份报告，大部分与追查内鬼的行动有关。到目前为止，他的手下在德国某处找到了可疑的电话号码，尽管他们竭尽全力，却仍未能锁定任何名字。

Groaning, Hamamoto pressed his temples, trying to relieve himself when he heard a knocking on the glass door. He looked up and it was Fuyutsuki waiting there, standing. The old director gestured to the Sub-Commander to come inside.  
Hamamoto 呻吟着，按住太阳穴试图缓解压力，这时他听到玻璃门上传来敲击声。他抬头一看，是 Fuyutsuki 站在那里，老局长示意副指挥官进来。

After Fuyutsuki came in and sat down on one of the empty seats, Hamamoto offered him a cup of coffee, but out of tradition the former professor insisted that they should have some tea instead.  
Fuyutsuki 进来后坐在其中一个空位上，Hamamoto 递给他一杯咖啡，但出于传统，这位前教授坚持他们应该改喝茶。

Once Hamamoto finished preparing the tea and gave one of the cups to Fuyutsuki, who thanked him, only then after he sat down on his high-backed chair he was able to ask, "Pardon me, sir, but may I ask what brings you here?"  
待羽本准备好茶水，递给冬月一杯并得到对方的感谢后，他才坐回高背椅上，开口问道：“不好意思，先生，请问您此行有何贵干？”

"It's really important. Have Kanzaki told you about me coming here?" Fuyutsuki questioned after he sipped his tea.  
“这事儿挺重要的。神崎跟你提过我会来吗？”冬月啜了口茶后问道。

Hamamoto nodded. "I was told that I was to expect you… A very serious problem we have to talk about, he said." He then took a sip and breathed easy.  
羽本点点头。“他提过，说你会来……我们有个非常严重的问题需要讨论。”说完，他抿了一口茶，稍稍放松了些。

"By the way, where's he?" Fuyutsuki questioned, as if concerned.  
“顺便问一下，他在哪儿？”冬月问道，似乎有些担忧。

"I've sent him to check on our new weapons shipment."  
“我派他去检查我们的新武器运送情况了。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Ah… I see."

Hamamoto sighed. "Tell me, sir… What's up this time?"  
滨本叹了口气。“告诉我，先生……这次又是什么情况？”

"First of all, I'm aware that you're under much pressure to produce a mole," Fuyutsuki said.  
“首先，我知道你承受着巨大压力要培养出一个间谍，”冬月说。

"That's right," Hamamoto answered. "Commander Ikari's damn impatient."  
“没错，”滨本回答，“碇司令他妈的没耐心。”

"Now, are you very well aware that this mole is just a part of a bigger plan?"  
“那么，你非常清楚这个间谍只是更大计划的一部分吗？”

Hamamoto nodded. "I think so, sir, but already we're close to getting a name, and we found out that Oda had a contact somewhere in Germany. A big one, I guess, and could be his employer."  
浜本点了点头。“我想是的，先生，但我们已经接近得到一个名字了，而且我们发现织田在德国有一个联系人。我猜是个大人物，可能是他的雇主。”

"Even if there are no names yet, I'm afraid to say that we're facing a real threat."  
“即使还没有名字，恐怕我得说我们正面临一个真正的威胁。”

"From whom?"

Fuyutsuki set down his cup onto the desk and asked outright, "What do you know of SEELE?"  
冬月将杯子放在桌上，直截了当地问道：“你对 SEELE 了解多少？”

Hamamoto blinked twice, and then shook his head. For a few moments he gave himself pause to mull over this mysterious name, and then admitted, "I have no idea, sir."  
浜本眨了两次眼，然后摇了摇头。他停顿片刻，细细思索这个神秘的名字，随后承认道：“我不知道，先生。”

Fuyutsuki sighed. "This is going to be between you and me, so listen closely," he warned.  
冬月叹了口气。“这件事只有你知我知，所以仔细听好，”他警告道。

Meanwhile, hundreds of meters away, Gendo Ikari was staring at the deputy director of Second Section, Edgar Morrissey, both unaware of the transaction between Fuyutsuki and Hamamoto.  
与此同时，数百米之外，碇源堂正盯着第二分部的副主任埃德加·莫里西，两人都未察觉到冬月和滨本的秘密交易。

Prior to being employed by NERV, Morrissey was a former British intelligence officer for nearly twenty years, and having survived one of the wars that plagued the planet in the aftermath of Second Impact.  
在加入 NERV 之前，莫里西曾是英国情报部门的一名特工，长达近二十年，并在第二次冲击后的一场战争中幸存下来。

As it was customary within Ikari's throne room, Morrissey stood right before the Commander, his suit well-pressed, and wore a grave expression on his face that seemed to be permanently marked on, as though he had seen too much in his entire career. His brown hair now had some strands of gray, a product of dealing with stressful situations endemic in intelligence work.  
按照伊卡里王座间的惯例，莫里森站在指挥官面前，西装笔挺，脸上带着严肃的表情，仿佛整个职业生涯中见过了太多，以至于这表情似乎已永久刻在他的脸上。他棕色的头发如今夹杂着几缕灰白，这是情报工作中普遍存在的压力情境的产物。

Now he was here, summoned but without informing Hamamoto about being here. It was so quiet in this place that Morrissey could hear the faint cycle of Ikari's breathing, as that man's hands were folded right before his face, the amber-tinted glasses gleaming in the dim light.  
现在他在这里，被召唤而来，却没有通知滨本。这个地方如此安静，以至于莫里森能听到伊卡里呼吸的微弱循环，那人的双手交叠在脸前，琥珀色的眼镜在昏暗的光线中闪烁。

As protocol dictated, Morrissey decided that it would be best to let the Commander do the talking first; it was open knowledge that Commander Ikari was the definitive overlord of the house, and his word was law.  
根据规定，莫里森决定最好让指挥官先开口；众所周知，伊卡里指挥官是家族中的绝对主宰，他的话就是法律。

"Mister Morrissey, I know that your predecessor will be retiring next month, is that correct?"  
“莫里斯先生，我知道您的上一任将于下个月退休，是这样吗？”

Morrissey nodded. "Yes, Commander, Director Hamamoto told me about it," he answered in Queen's English.  
莫里斯点点头。“是的，指挥官，哈马莫托主任已经告诉我了，”他用标准的英式英语回答道。

Gendo let off his customary, low-frequency murmur that almost everyone at NERV knew was either a yes or a no, and in this case it was a "yes".  
源渡发出他惯有的低频呢喃，NERV 的几乎每个人都熟悉这声音，它要么表示肯定，要么表示否定，而这次是“肯定”。

"May I ask something, Commander?"  
"指挥官，我可以问个问题吗？"

"Go ahead," Gendo answered.  
"请说，" 源渡回答道。"

"Is there anything you wish for me to do?"  
"您有什么事情希望我去做的吗？"

Gendo leaned forward and said, "The reason I want you here is for you, without Hamamoto's knowledge and as I could no longer rely on his good judgment, to pick, prepare and brief several of your best men for an operation." He then palmed a folder that was sitting on his desk, and offered it to Morrissey, who stepped forward and took it. The deputy then read the brief prepared for him, scanned the pages, before closing it and tucking beneath his arm.  
源渡身体前倾，说道：“我让你来这里的原因是，在你不知情的情况下，我不能再依赖滨本的良好判断，让你挑选、准备并简要介绍几名你最优秀的队员执行一项任务。”他说着，将桌上的一个文件夹推到手心，递给莫里西，后者上前接过。副手随即阅读了为他准备的简报，浏览了页面，然后合上文件夹，夹在腋下。

"Your target will be extremely dangerous," Gendo added, "so you must be prepared to deal with him, but I want him _alive_."  
“你的目标将极其危险，”源渡补充道，“所以你必须准备好对付他，但我希望他活着。”

"We can deal with high-risk targets like him, sir," Morrissey answered, "and I believe that you have read the rest of my résumé."  
“我们可以对付像他这样的高风险目标，长官，”莫里西回答，“我相信您已经读过我的其余简历了。”

Indeed Gendo knew that, in Morrissey's previous career as an intelligence officer he'd been involved in snatching terrorist cell members and leaders in the dead of night, and in a rare occasion, a narco-dictator of a South American country wanted with a bounty by several countries.  
确实，源渡知道，莫里西在之前作为情报官员的职业生涯中，曾参与过在深夜抓捕恐怖组织成员和领导人的行动，偶尔还会涉及一个南美国家的毒枭独裁者，此人因悬赏被多个国家通缉。

"This is what you were trained for, Mister Morrissey," Gendo emphasized.  
“这正是你受训的目的，莫里西先生，”源渡强调道。

Morrissey nodded. "Yes, Commander. That's true."  
莫里西点头。“是的，指挥官。确实如此。”

"If you and your men accomplish this, and hand him over to me without a scratch, I will guarantee that your salary will be improved on once you take over Hamamoto's position."  
"如果你和你的手下能完成这项任务，毫发无损地将他交给我，我保证在你接替 Hamamoto 的位置后，你的薪水将会得到提升。"

The deputy director breathed easy. "Thank you, Commander. We'll do what you say," Morrissey answered before saluting.  
副指挥官松了一口气。“谢谢您，指挥官。我们会照您说的做，”Morrissey 回答后敬了个礼。

Gendo nodded. "As soon as I give the word, you are to act on it immediately."  
碇点点头。“我一发话，你们就立即行动。”

"Yes, sir. No problem."  
"是的，先生。没问题。"

"You are dismissed. Thank you, Mister Morrissey," Gendo concluded.  
"你可以走了。谢谢你，莫里西先生，" 碇源堂总结道。

Once Morrissey left the office and entered the elevator, he thought of the name and the face that leaped off the dossier, but then he decided that this was no different from the other missions he had in the past.  
莫里西离开办公室进入电梯后，他想起了那份档案中跳出来的名字和面孔，但随后他决定，这与过去他执行的其他任务并无不同。

_No, it's just like the old days_, he thought, and then he played the name _Kaworu Nagisa_ around his brain.  
不，就像过去一样，他想，然后在脑海中反复琢磨着渚薰这个名字。

---

Both interrupted, Misato and Ritsuko heard the knocking on the door. The head scientist called out, asking, "Who is it?"  
两人都被打断了，葛城美理和赤木律子听到了敲门声。首席科学家喊道：“是谁？”

"Hyuga," the voice answered from behind the door.  
“日向，”门后的声音回答道。

"Come in," Ritsuko said, and Makoto walked in. In his hand he held a folder sandwiching what looked to be a bunch of printouts.  
“进来吧，”律子说道，真琴便走了进来。他手中拿着一个文件夹，夹着看似一堆打印文件的东西。

"Thought you might want to know," Makoto said to Misato, as he tabled the folder and the older woman laid it out for her to read. "They're my assessments of what the SSDF has in store at the moment," he added.  
“我想你可能想知道，”真琴对美里说，同时将文件夹放在桌上，年长的女性将其展开以便阅读。“这些是我对战略自卫队目前储备的评估，”他补充道。

The first few pages were culled directly from _Jane's World Armies_, laying out the current status of the Strategic Self-Defense Force.  
前几页直接摘自《简氏世界军队》，概述了战略自卫队的当前状态。

Ever since Second Impact, the Strategic Self-Defense Force had doubled in size, in manpower, firepower and equipment, after the Japanese constitution was revised, including Article 9, which stated that all military forces should be organized purely for defensive purposes, that Japan must not obtain powerful weaponry for purposes other than for home defense, and that all weapons in possession must be within lawful limits.  
自从第二次冲击后，战略自卫队的人员、火力和装备规模都翻了一番，这是在日本宪法修订后，包括第九条，该条款规定所有军事力量应纯粹为防御目的而组织，日本不得获取除本土防御以外的强大武器，且所持武器必须合法合规。

At the moment, despite criticism from some of its neighbors, the SSDF had much more _offensive_ firepower at its disposal than ever before, including non-nuclear ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, battle-cruisers, bombers and fuel-air explosive bombs; in essence, the SSDF was anything but _defensive_ in name_._  
目前，尽管遭到一些邻国的批评，战略自卫队拥有的进攻性火力比以往任何时候都多，包括非核弹道导弹、巡航导弹、战列巡洋舰、轰炸机和燃料空气炸弹；实际上，战略自卫队名不副实，绝非仅限于防御。

Reading on, Misato noted that currently the SSDF had concentrated its most hardened divisions around the Hakone region, by land, air and sea:

Finding that this array of forces was overwhelmingly powerful, Misato groaned and told Makoto, "What if… What if we find ourselves confronting against an attacker of this size?"  
发现这支部队强大到令人窒息，美里呻吟着对真琴说：“万一……万一我们面对的是如此规模的敌人，该怎么办？”

At Misato's rather unusual assertion, Makoto blinked in astonishment: it was unimaginable that he, a Japanese national, could be taking aim at his fellow countryman once more. Indeed, it was generations since the last yet brief civil war, called the Boshin War of 1868-1869, fought with cannons, rifles, sabers, daikatana and bayonets, in skirmishes between the newly-established Meiji forces and the troops of the outlawed Tokugawa shogunate, leaving floods of blood to irrigate the rice fields.  
对于美里这番颇为不寻常的言论，真琴惊讶地眨了眨眼：难以想象，他一个日本人，竟会再次将枪口对准同胞。的确，自上一次短暂的内战——1868-1869 年的戊辰战争以来，已经过去了数代人，那场战争中，新成立的明治政府军与被废黜的德川幕府军队在炮火、步枪、军刀、大剑和刺刀的交锋中，留下了无数鲜血浇灌稻田的惨烈景象。

"Are you kidding? I mean, you think we could be in a shooting war anytime soon? Against our own government?" Makoto doubted loudly.  
"你在开玩笑吧？你是说，我们可能会很快卷入一场枪战？对抗我们自己的政府？" 真嗣大声表示怀疑。

Misato shook her head. "No, not really," she countered. "It's just a 'what if'."  
美里摇了摇头。"不，不是真的，"她反驳道。"只是个'假设'罢了。"

"No, why they could be our enemy?" Ritsuko asked. "We've been working with them ever since Shinji first came here, and other than that little issue we had with that positron sniper rifle, which was settled for afterwards… I don't think we warrant anything bigger that could piss them off."  
"不，为什么他们会成为我们的敌人？" 律子问道。"自从真嗣第一次来到这里，我们就一直在和他们合作，除了那次我们遇到的小问题，关于那个阳电子狙击步枪的事，后来也解决了……我不认为我们有做什么更过分的事会惹恼他们。"

But then Misato answered, "You and I should wonder why they put up a force so large," she said. "I'm not sure about the government's real reasons for placing the _Jietai_ outside our backyard, even as what they claim in the news. So what if they found out the true purpose of our Evas?" _Jietai_ was the shortened name for the SSDF.  
但随后美里回答道：“你我应该疑惑他们为何部署如此庞大的力量，”她说。“我不确定政府将自卫队安置在我们后院的真正原因，即便他们的新闻宣称如此。那么，如果他们发现了我们 EVA 的真实目的呢？”自卫队是 SSDF 的简称。

Silence fell upon the trio, as they contemplated the unthinkable.  
三人陷入了沉默，思考着这难以想象的情况。

"It falls upon us to do something about this," Makoto said.  
“我们得采取行动，”真琴说。

Misato and Ritsuko nodded, before the raven-haired woman said, "We may have the will to change all this, but we've got to find a way to stop this madness, or we could be staring at the barrel of a gun."  
美里和律子点头后，黑发女子说道：“我们或许有改变这一切的决心，但我们必须找到阻止这种疯狂的方法，否则我们可能正面对着枪口。”

Misato then sighed and added, "I'll see what we could do."  
美里随后叹了口气，补充道：“我会看看我们能做些什么。”

Makoto nodded. "Right, and as you said before, getting to know what poker school we're in."  
真点点头。“没错，正如你之前所说，了解我们处于哪种扑克学校。”

For a moment Misato took her time to think. As part of her martial studies, she once read the entirety of Sun Tzu's _Art of War_, which one of strategist's famous dictums said that in a defensive position, all her forces must be placed deeper in the ground.  
一时间，美里从容地思考着。作为她武术学习的一部分，她曾读过《孙子兵法》的全文，其中一位战略家的名言提到，在防御位置上，她的所有力量必须更深入地埋伏。

She played with the possibility of the national government and the SSDF going hostile on them, using her imagination to think of what they would do in case should those military forces try to break in.  
她设想了国家政府和 SSDF 对他们采取敌对行动的可能性，运用想象力思考如果这些军事力量试图闯入，他们会怎么做。

"So, suppose they make the decision to assault us, what they'll be doing first?" Misato asked.  
“那么，假设他们决定攻击我们，他们会先做什么？”美里问道。

"Breach into every gate and passageway we have, then they send in the troops," Makoto answered.  
“他们先突破我们所有的闸门和通道，然后再派兵进来，”真琴回答道。

"Correct, but we still have several advantages, though," Misato said. "One, most of our blast doors are more than a meter thick, which should deter most kinds of munitions, save for a direct hit with a bunker-buster bomb with a penetrator warhead, and we can also disable the locks; two, ground vehicles will have to use the elevators and the linear trains, and we can also knock them out of commission before they could use them; three, if my memory serves me right, any attacker not used to the Geofront's layout will lose himself; and finally, we can flood every passageway with Bakelite, which should stop them in their tracks."  
“没错，但我们仍有几个优势，”美里说，“首先，我们的大部分防爆门厚度超过一米，足以抵御大多数弹药，除非直接命中带有穿甲弹头的碉堡炸弹，而且我们还能关闭锁具；其次，地面车辆必须使用电梯和直线列车，我们可以在他们使用之前将其摧毁；第三，如果我没记错，任何不熟悉第三新东京市布局的攻击者都会迷失方向；最后，我们可以用酚醛树脂淹没所有通道，这应该能让他们寸步难行。”

"But…" Makoto interjected, "What about the N2s? What if they launched one against us? They still have about a dozen of them."  
“但是…”真琴插话道，“N2 炸弹呢？如果他们向我们发射一枚怎么办？他们还剩下大约十几枚。”

That one caught Misato unawares. "You mean a direct hit right on top of us?"  
"那一击让美里措手不及。“你是说直接命中我们头顶？””

Makoto nodded. "Yeah. As you can see, Unit Zero had left a huge crater right up there, and that explosion took the upper half of the armor plating away, and weakened the rest, which means that if they use an N2, which we know that it has a yield of two to three kilotons, that blast would literally rip out whatever overhead protection we have left."  
"真点点头。“没错。正如你所见，零号机在那里留下了一个巨大的弹坑，那次爆炸将上半部分的装甲板炸飞了，并削弱了其余部分，这意味着如果他们使用 N2 炸弹，我们知道其当量在两到三千吨，那次爆炸将彻底摧毁我们剩余的任何头顶防护。””

"Shit," Misato cursed. "Once that happens, we're literally sitting ducks if they follow it up with bombs and missiles raining down our heads, before bringing in a siege force by air."  
"“该死，”美里咒骂道。“一旦发生那种情况，如果他们紧接着用炸弹和导弹对我们狂轰滥炸，然后再通过空中引入围攻部队，我们就真的成了瓮中之鳖了。””

Now she drummed her fingers on the table, trying to figure out another way to defend themselves while minimizing casualties.  
现在她用手指敲打着桌面，试图找出另一种减少伤亡的自卫方法。

"We have our trump card, though," Misato said. "Apart from our new arsenal, the mere presence of an Eva or two will scare them to shit in their pants… and oh, speaking of an arsenal, what do we have for trigger fingers right now?"  
“不过我们还有王牌，”美里说，“除了我们的新武器库，只要有一两台 EVA 在场，就能把他们吓得屁滚尿流……哦，说到武器库，我们现在有哪些能用的武器？”

Makoto grinned. "Just for you to know, I have also included the inventory list from yesterday's shipping manifest."  
真希波笑了笑。“只是让你知道，我还包括了昨天发货清单的库存列表。”

Misato flipped the pages to get to the list and read closely. She was initially impressed by the largess on the list:  
美里翻到清单页，仔细阅读。她最初对清单上的大量武器感到印象深刻：

_**WEAPONS SHIPMENT**_ _– Inventory Listing 1, Infantry Weapons and Equipment__**Set 1 / Assault Rifles:**_ _Colt M4A1 (1,800 pieces)__**Set 2 / Submachine Guns:**_ _H&K MP5A4 (1,000 pieces), H&K MP7 (new, 200 pieces), FN P90 (new, 500 pieces)__**Set 3 / Machine Guns / SAW:**_ _FN M249 Minimi (60 pieces), FN M240 (60 pieces), Browning M2 (20 pieces)__**Set 4 / Launchers:**_ _H&K XM320 grenade launcher (200 pieces), LAW anti-tank launcher (70 pieces); AT-4 anti-tank launcher (50 pieces)__**Set 5 / Explosives:**_ _C4 (50 lots, including blasting caps, detonators, det cord), Claymore (100 sets, with det cord and clackers)__**Set 6 / Sniper Rifles:**_ _H&K MSG90A1 (20 pieces), Barrett M82A4 (10 pieces)__**Set 7 / Pistols:**_ _Glock 17 (2,000 pieces, surplus), H&K USP (1,000 pieces), USP MK23 (100 pieces)_  
武器运输 – 库存清单 1，步兵武器及装备__第一部分 / 突击步枪：柯尔特 M4A1（1,800 支）__第二部分 / 冲锋枪：H&K MP5A4（1,000 支），H&K MP7（新款，200 支），FN P90（新款，500 支）__第三部分 / 机枪 / 轻机枪：FN M249 Minimi（60 支），FN M240（60 支），布朗宁 M2（20 支）__第四部分 / 发射器：H&K XM320 榴弹发射器（200 支），LAW 反坦克发射器（70 支）；AT-4 反坦克发射器（50 支）__第五部分 / 爆炸物：C4（50 批，含雷管、引爆器、导爆索），克莱莫地雷（100 套，带导爆索和击发器）__第六部分 / 狙击步枪：H&K MSG90A1（20 支），巴雷特 M82A4（10 支）__第七部分 / 手枪：格洛克 17（2,000 支，剩余），H&K USP（1,000 支），USP MK23（100 支）  
_All weapons include matching ammunition, additional equipment and/or accessories, with certification and servicing records.  
所有武器均配备相应弹药、附加设备或配件，并附有认证和服务记录。_

"We still have some heavy artillery of our own, though," Makoto helpfully suggested. "The munitions we use against the Angels, most of which we have anti-aircraft and SAM batteries right around the Geofront, some light armored vehicles, and of course our Cheyennes."  
"不过，我们还有一些重型武器。" 真琴热心地提议道，"我们用来对付使徒的弹药，大部分在 Geofront 周围设有防空和地对空导弹电池，还有一些轻型装甲车，当然还有我们的夏延直升机。"

"This list is good, yet…" Misato trailed off, laying down the manifest on the desk as she turned her attention to Makoto. "Do we have enough qualified personnel to carry, and if possible, fire these weapons?" she asked.  
"这份清单不错，但是……" 美里话音渐弱，将清单放在桌上，转向真琴，"我们有足够合格的人员来携带，甚至可能发射这些武器吗？" 她问道。"

Makoto nodded, before adjusting his glasses. "Sure," he answered. "Less than half of our people have any prior military background before coming here, including those with actual combat experience."  
真琴点头，然后调整了一下眼镜。"当然，" 他回答，"我们的人中不到一半在来这里之前有任何军事背景，包括那些有实际战斗经验的人。"

Misato reclined back on her seat, sighed, and then she said, "We may sound ready, but it'll be up to those two Commanders to decide what we have to do next… Only once they give us a chance and an ear, because this is clearly a grave situation we're dealing with."  
美里靠在椅背上，叹了口气，然后说道：“我们或许听起来准备好了，但接下来该做什么将由那两位指挥官决定……只有当他们给我们机会并倾听时，因为这显然是我们正在处理的严重情况。”

Having said their farewells to their classmates, then signed off and shut down the computer, Shinji and Asuka were now lying on the bed, feeling jaded, wondering what else they wanted to do next with so much time left. At the moment the iPod on the desk, with a speaker plugged to it, was playing one of Shinji's favorite tracks from the _Ys_ image album.  
与同学们告别后，关闭并签退了电脑，真嗣和明日香现在正躺在床上，感到疲惫，不知道剩下的时间里还想做些什么。此刻，桌上的 iPod 插着扬声器，正在播放真嗣最喜欢的来自《伊苏》印象专辑中的一首曲子。

Asuka sighed, and said, "I'm bored."  
明日香叹了口气，说道：“我好无聊。”

The mere phrase reminded Shinji of their first kiss ever, and he laughed nervously.  
仅仅这个短语就让真嗣想起了他们的初吻，他紧张地笑了起来。

"Why you're laughing, dummy?" Asuka questioned, frowning in reaction.  
“你笑什么，傻瓜？”明日香问道，皱着眉头回应。

"It's… It's because back there you thought I had bad breath," Shinji answered, recalling that Asuka gargled like mad after their botched first kiss.  
“因为……因为那时候你以为我有口臭，”真嗣回答，回想起那次失败的初吻后明日香疯狂漱口的情景。

"And you're a lousy kisser, too," Asuka retorted back, and then snorted, crossing her arms across the chest. "Never mind, do you want it again?"  
"而且你接吻技术也很烂，" 明日香反驳道，然后哼了一声，双臂交叉在胸前。"算了，你还想再来一次吗？"

"Again?" he asked doubtfully.  
"再来一次？" 他怀疑地问道。

Asuka turned to Shinji, facing the boy and stared into his eyes languidly. "Bet you want more than that, don't you?" she teased.  
明日香转向真嗣，面对着男孩，慵懒地凝视着他的眼睛。"你想要的可不止这些吧？" 她逗弄道。

Shinji's heart rate doubled this time, and he blushed a bit. "More?"  
这次，真嗣的心跳加速了一倍，脸上也泛起了红晕。“更多？”

Without warning Asuka got up and sat on the bed, before she pulled up the boy by his arms. "I'm giving you a better chance this time," she declared.  
毫无预警地，明日香站起身来坐在床上，然后拉起真嗣的手臂。“这次我给你更好的机会，”她宣布道。

_What the heck she's talking about?_ Shinji thought, before he spoke, "For what?"  
她在说什么鬼话？真嗣心想，然后开口问道：“为了什么？”

Asuka leaned forward and she whispered, "How about we do _it_ right now?"  
明日香向前倾身，低声说道：“我们现在就做怎么样？”

This time Shinji looked flabbergasted, as the word _it_ probably meant _sex,_ and his face was now flaming red. "It?" he mumbled.  
这次真嗣看起来目瞪口呆，因为“它”很可能指的是性，他的脸现在涨得通红。“做？”他含糊地问。

The girl shook her head. "Show me what you have and I'll show you mine," Asuka said, paraphrasing a nice quote she once came across on a blog.  
女孩摇了摇头。“你展示你的，我展示我的，”明日香引用了一句她在博客上看到的不错的引语。

"Uh… Okay," Shinji answered, taking a deep breath first, and then she pulled the boy towards her and kissed him on the lips.  
“呃…好吧，”真嗣先深吸了一口气，然后她将男孩拉向自己，吻上了他的唇。

In the next few more seconds Shinji complied and pressed further, his lips exploring hers, until Asuka whispered, "Wait."  
接下来的几秒钟里，真嗣顺从地继续，他的唇探索着她的，直到明日香低声说：“等等。”

Disengaging to pause, he watched Asuka pull up the sundress over her head and tossed it aside, leaving her wearing only panties and bra. With that shocking gesture Shinji could feel his heart's jackhammer, the blood in his veins going on full blast, and his mouth gaped wide open in total astonishment.  
他停下来，看着明日香将太阳裙从头顶拉起并扔到一旁，只穿着内裤和胸罩。这一惊人的举动让真嗣感到心跳如擂鼓，血液在血管中奔涌，他的嘴惊讶地张得大大的。

"I… I… Uh…" Shinji stuttered in near shock.  
"我…我…呃…" 真嗣结结巴巴，几乎震惊得说不出话来。

Asuka can only laugh out loud, watching Shinji's flabbergasted reaction, and then she said, "You haven't seen me like this?"  
明日香只能放声大笑，看着真嗣目瞪口呆的反应，然后她说道："你还没见过我这样子吗？"

Shinji shook his head, yet his brain was totally racked with what to do next. "No, really!" he nervously blurted. "Tell me… No, don't tell me we're about to do _it!_"  
真嗣摇了摇头，但他的大脑完全被接下来该做什么所困扰。"不，真的！"他紧张地脱口而出。"告诉我…不，别告诉我我们就要做了！"

The boy's confusion and discomfiture only served to amuse and make Asuka laugh a lot more. "Good God, have you gone through some sex ed?" she asked. "Something's wrong with the curriculum, isn't it?"  
男孩的困惑和不安反而逗得明日香大笑不止。“天哪，你上过性教育课吗？”她问道，“肯定是课程内容有问题，对吧？”

"Uh… It must be," Shinji answered as though stupefied, but without warning Asuka grabbed the bottom of his shirt and pulled it over his head, before tossing it away onto the floor.  
“呃……应该是吧，”真嗣回答得有些呆滞，但没等他反应过来，明日香已经抓住他衬衫的下摆，一把将它从他头上扯下，扔到了地板上。

Now bare-chested, Shinji swallowed hard, heart throbbing, really unsure what to do, but he tried his best to remember how situations such as this are handled properly… in the movies. He then took a deep breath, centered himself and with his eyes slowly took stock of Asuka's body, as she held herself still for him to let his eyes do some exploration.  
此刻赤裸上身，真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，心跳如鼓，完全不知道该怎么办，但他尽力回忆起电影里这种场合是如何处理的。他深吸一口气，稳住心神，目光缓缓扫过明日香的身体，而她则静静地站在那里，任由他的视线探索。

To begin with, her matching underwear had a pink floral rose print all over, bits of lace and silk; her strapless bra kept her chest at bay, but barely as she was still undergoing her growth spurt, and her bosom was growing steadily, forming an impressive cleavage. He then moved his stare downwards, slowly and carefully, and focused on her crotch just below her abdomen.  
首先，她那套搭配的内衣是粉色的玫瑰花印花，点缀着蕾丝和丝绸；她的无肩带胸罩勉强压制着胸部，因为她正处于发育期，胸部正稳步增长，形成了一道引人注目的乳沟。他随后将目光缓缓下移，小心翼翼地，聚焦在她腹部下方的私密处。

Her crotch, that forbidden territory hidden behind that patch of cotton and silk. The prize, the crown jewels, the wildest dream of all dreams made true, that every boy of his age talked about so much, behind closed doors, in water closets, under the trees, reading forbidden adult manga and magazines in bedrooms, and yet only a few have barely able to go this far.  
她的私密处，那片被棉布和丝绸遮掩的禁地。那是奖赏，是皇冠上的宝石，是所有梦想中最狂野的实现，每个同龄男孩都在私下里、厕所中、树荫下，偷偷阅读成人漫画和杂志时热烈讨论的，然而只有极少数人能走到这一步。

Like now.

Again Shinji swallowed, with a big deal of nervous eagerness he had not seen in himself before. All other personal events were shelved, whether they were his triumphs or tragedies, and forgotten, with all of his thoughts focused on this single opportunity that…  
再次，真嗣咽了咽口水，带着前所未有的紧张与渴望。所有其他个人事件，无论是他的成功还是失败，都被搁置一旁，遗忘殆尽，他的全部思绪都集中在这唯一的机会上……

_Why can't I?_ Shinji thought, feeling the need to slap himself or pinch his cheeks to make sure he wasn't dreaming.  
为什么我不行？真嗣心想，感觉需要扇自己一巴掌或捏捏脸颊来确认自己不是在做梦。  
_Why not?  
This is real. This is really happening…  
这是真的。这一切真的正在发生……_

As if she heard him, Asuka whispered, "Touch me."  
仿佛听到了他的心声，明日香低声说道：“触碰我。”

---

On the other hand and almost naked, despite her seemingly calm demeanor in introducing Shinji to the joys of making his "first time", Asuka herself was just as tense as the young man, as she felt her heart thumping hard, while trying to control her composure and breathing.  
另一方面，尽管在向真嗣介绍初次体验的乐趣时显得颇为镇定，几乎一丝不挂的明日香其实和年轻人一样紧张，她能感觉到自己的心跳剧烈，同时努力控制着镇定和呼吸。

To be honest, she _never_ had a real sexual encounter, but before she attempted to have someone seduce her… and failed.  
老实说，她从未真正经历过性爱，但在此之前，她曾试图让人引诱她……却失败了。

Her idea of sex was something she watched on video, the typical movie couple falling for each other after a drunken night at the bar, perfect strangers who barely knew who they were except for the brief exchange of introductions followed by some interesting conversation, Asuka watched one of those onscreen inebriated couples slowly kiss, then touch each other as they disrobed, savoring each other's presence and aura, before lying down on the bed to couple in heated passion till the light of dawn.  
她对性的理解来自视频中的场景，那些典型的电影情侣在酒吧醉酒后坠入爱河，本是素不相识的陌生人，除了短暂的自我介绍和一些有趣的对话外，几乎不了解对方。明日香曾目睹屏幕上那些醉酒的情侣缓缓亲吻，然后相互触摸，在脱衣的过程中品味彼此的存在和气息，最终躺在床上，在激情的缠绵中直至黎明。

Was Asuka ready to do what fiction told her? Could Shinji follow her into the unknown depths of losing their virginity?  
阿斯卡是否准备好按照小说中的指示行事？真嗣能否跟随她进入失去童贞的未知深渊？

There was a lot riding on, and so Asuka, sitting still, watched Shinji carefully and slowly extend his hand closer to her shoulder, wanting him to touch and caress her skin, then maybe for another kiss, before she would let him glide his lips along her neck and downward…  
这一切至关重要，因此阿斯卡静静坐着，仔细观察着真嗣小心翼翼地伸出手，慢慢靠近她的肩膀，渴望他触碰并抚摸她的肌肤，或许再吻一次，然后她会让他沿着她的脖颈轻轻滑下……

Asuka closed her eyes in anticipation, hoping that Shinji had the sense to show his love and affection, and then she felt his fingers and the bed moving slightly as Shinji adjusted himself to come close, and hopefully take her in for a ride...  
阿斯卡闭上眼睛，期待着真嗣能表现出他的爱意和情感，随后她感觉到他的手指和床微微移动，真嗣调整姿势靠近她，希望能与她共赴云雨……

---

Suddenly without warning both Children heard the loud ringing on the door, and that really startled them completely, causing Shinji to withdraw his hand from Asuka as they turned to scrutinize the source of the racket. All of that nervous anticipation, the growing tension and excitement between the lovers instantly vanished, replaced by complete annoyance accompanied by their surprise.  
突然间，没有任何预警，两个孩子听到了门铃的响亮声，这让他们完全吓了一跳，导致真嗣从明日香身边抽回了手，他们转身仔细审视着噪音的来源。所有的紧张期待，恋人之间不断增长的紧张和兴奋瞬间消失，取而代之的是完全的恼怒伴随着他们的惊讶。

"What the hell?" Asuka demanded, totally disrupted, as she covered her chest with arms across, like as if someone peeped through the keyhole and caught them in the act.  
“搞什么鬼？”明日香要求道，完全被打扰了，她用双臂交叉遮住胸部，仿佛有人透过钥匙孔窥视并当场抓住了他们。

Deciding to take matters in his own hands, Shinji called almost loudly, "Who is it?"  
决定自己处理这件事，真嗣几乎大声地喊道：“是谁？”

"It's Nagisa," Kaworu answered from behind the door. "I have Ayanami with me," he added.  
"是渚," 渚薰在门后回答道。"我把绫波带来了," 他补充说。

For a few seconds, the two Children stared at each other, having a double-take, and then…  
有那么几秒钟，两个孩子互相盯着对方，愣了一下，然后……

"Oh, shit!" Asuka cursed under her breath.  
"哦，该死！" 明日香低声咒骂道。

"C'mon, dress up!" Shinji rejoined, as they quickly scrambled on the floor to pick up their clothes, and struggled to get dressed.  
"快点，打扮一下！" 真嗣催促道，他们迅速在地上捡起衣服，挣扎着穿上。

In about ten seconds they stood before the door, and Shinji unlocked it to find Rei and Kaworu confronting them, eye to eye. In his hand was the metal box, now inside a plastic bag which he asked for at the Reception Desk while on their way.  
大约十秒钟后，他们站在门前，真嗣打开门，发现丽和薰正面对面地看着他们。他手里拿着那个金属盒子，现在装在一个塑料袋里，这是他们在路上向接待处要的。

"We are sorry for disturbing you," Rei said.  
"很抱歉打扰你们了，" 丽说道。

Asuka blinked, wondering what was going on, and, noticing Kaworu's parcel, she asked, "What's that box? I thought you two were going..."  
明日香眨了眨眼，不知道发生了什么，注意到渚薰手里的包裹，她问道：“那个盒子是什么？我以为你们俩要去……”

Nonchalantly Kaworu noted that the other couple's faces were blushing. "What's going on with the both of you, too?" he questioned curiously.  
渚薰漫不经心地注意到另一对情侣的脸都红了。“你们俩又是怎么回事？”他好奇地问道。

Shinji shrugged. "N… Well… Nothing," he answered, trying to pick the correct response.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“没……呃……没什么，”他回答道，努力挑选着合适的回答。

Kaworu turned to Rei and he simply smiled, as if signaling to her that something occurred between Asuka and Shinji, before he faced the boy again.  
渚薰转向绫波，他只是微笑着，仿佛在向她暗示明日香和真嗣之间发生了什么，然后他又面对着男孩。

"I see," Kaworu said, as they stepped into the quarters. "We found this box, but we need Katsuragi to see this."  
“我明白了，”渚薰说着，他们走进了房间。“我们找到了这个盒子，但我们需要葛城来看看这个。”

Asuka took note of the embossed kanji on the box, as it belonged to Kaji. She sighed and asked Kaworu, "Where did you find it?"  
明日香注意到了盒子上压印的汉字，它属于加持。她叹了口气，问渚薰：“你在哪里找到的？”

"I tripped on it as we were about to leave, and I dug it up," Kaworu answered as he pulled the box out of the plastic bag, took a newspaper and spread it beneath to keep the tatami mat from being soiled, before he laid the box on the floor. He then unshod his backpack and set it aside.  
"我离开前被它绊了一下，就把它挖出来了，"渚回答道，他从塑料袋里拿出盒子，拿了一份报纸铺在榻榻米上以防弄脏，然后把盒子放在地板上。接着他脱下背包，放在一旁。

"Okay," Asuka cut in as she stood up, walked over and grabbed her cellphone from the bedside table, then dialed the number. "I'm gonna call Misato right now," she added.  
"好吧，"明日香打断道，她站起来，走过去从床头柜上拿起手机，拨了号码。"我现在就给美里打电话，"她补充道。

---

The quiet atmosphere within Ritsuko's lab was broken when Misato's phone went off. The woman pulled it out of her pocket, recognized Asuka's phone number on display, and answered, "Yeah?"  
律子实验室内的宁静被美里的手机铃声打破。她从口袋里掏出手机，看到屏幕上显示的是明日香的号码，便接听道："喂？"

"Thought you might want to come down here," Asuka answered.  
"以为你可能想下来这里，" 明日香回答道。

Misato blinked. "What?" she demanded.  
美里眨了眨眼。"什么？" 她质问道。

"Kaworu has found something."  
"渚薰发现了什么。"

"I thought he and Rei were going to her home?"  
"我以为他和丽是要去她家？"

Asuka voiced a sigh and replied, "That has just changed."  
明日香叹了口气回答道："计划有变。"

"Okay, I'll be there in a jiffy," Misato said.  
"好的，我马上到，"美里说。"

"No problem," Asuka answered, before disconnecting the call.  
"没问题，" 明日香回答，随后挂断了电话。

Pocketing the phone back, the woman now looked around and leaned to Ritsuko, who was about to return to her job of analyzing the synchro data. "I'd better go," Misato said. "Something's up with the Children."  
把手机放回口袋，这位女士环顾四周，向即将回去分析同步数据的律子靠了靠。"我最好去看看，"美里说，"孩子们那边有点不对劲。"

Ritsuko nodded. "Okay, I'll handle my end here. Tell me once you get back here."  
律子点点头。"好的，我这边会处理好。你回来后告诉我情况。"

"Thanks," Misato agreed, before turning to Makoto. "You go check up with Section Two, and give me a finding on what's up with the government and the _Jietai._ I also authorize you to send up a UAV to eyeball those units."  
“谢谢，”美里同意道，随后转向真。“你去和第二部门联系一下，查清楚政府和自卫队那边的情况。我授权你派一架无人机去监视那些部队。”

"No problem," Makoto accepted, as he adjusted his glasses. "It'll be a cinch."  
“没问题，”真答应着，调整了一下眼镜。“小菜一碟。”

---

After some ten minutes, Misato walked into their quarters to find the Children waiting for her, sitting on the tatami mat, clustered around the mystery box.  
大约十分钟后，美里走进他们的房间，发现孩子们正坐在榻榻米上，围着那个神秘的箱子等她。

"What's that?" Misato asked, curious about the artifact that Kaworu brought in.  
"那是什么？" 美里问道，对渚薰带来的那个物品感到好奇。

"It belonged to Kaji," Kaworu answered.  
"这是加持的，" 渚薰回答道。

Misato blinked. "What? How… where did you find it?"  
美里眨了眨眼。"什么？怎么……你在哪里找到的？"

Kaworu explained as to how he discovered the box by accident, before he said, "It has his name on it, so I think it would be important for you to see what's inside."  
渚薰解释说他如何偶然发现了这个盒子，然后说道：“上面有他的名字，我想这对您来说看到里面的东西很重要。”

The woman thought of it for a moment, and then she said, "Can I have a moment alone? You can go get something to drink or whatever."  
女人想了一会儿，然后说：“我能单独待一会儿吗？你可以去喝点什么或者做别的。”

"But…" Shinji trailed off.  
“但是…” 真嗣话没说完。

Misato shook her head. "This is too personal, and I have to see this for myself."  
美里摇了摇头。“这太私人了，我必须亲自看看。”

The boy sighed. "Okay, if that what you want."  
男孩叹了口气。“好吧，如果你坚持的话。”

"Thank you," Misato answered with a sad smile as she watched her charges walk out of the door, leaving her alone. Once she had the whole place to herself, Misato steeled herself not to cry as she began to open the lid on the box.  
“谢谢你，”美里带着悲伤的微笑回答，看着她的孩子们走出门口，留下她一个人。一旦她独自一人，美里鼓起勇气不让自己哭泣，开始打开箱子的盖子。

---

Out in the hallway, Shinji decided that they will have to wait at the lounge and grab themselves drinks from the vending machines.  
在走廊上，真嗣决定他们得在休息室等待，并从自动售货机里给自己拿些饮料。

As Shinji bought himself a Coke, he said, "I just hope she shouldn't take it hard this time."  
当真嗣给自己买了一罐可乐时，他说：“我只希望她这次不要太过在意。”

"Yeah," Asuka agreed, picking up a bottle of Calpis from the bin. "I wonder what's inside that box," she added while unscrewing the cap.  
“是啊，”明日香同意道，从架子上拿起一瓶可尔必思。“我想知道那盒子里装了什么，”她一边拧开瓶盖一边补充道。

Rei said nothing but took a sip of her canned tea instead.  
丽没有说话，只是喝了一口她的罐装茶。

"Not until she shows to us whatever that's inside," Kaworu said, before he pulled the tab off his can of iced coffee.  
“在她向我们展示里面是什么之前，”渚薰说着，拉开他那罐冰咖啡的拉环，“我是不会罢休的。”

---

Back in their quarters, with the box opened, revealing that it was stuffed with many notes, Misato figured that Kaji, being an intelligence agent, knew that he had voluminous amounts of information that he must hoard and process, and his use of notes probably meant that not all agents were capable of photographic memory.  
回到他们的住处，打开盒子，里面塞满了许多笔记，美里意识到，作为一名情报人员，加持知道他必须囤积和处理大量信息，而他使用笔记可能意味着并非所有特工都具备过目不忘的能力。

The first thing she recalled was the last phone message he left, and back then she didn't realized that it was his last will and testament, couched in wordplay, telling her where she was supposed to find what Kaji claimed to be the truth of the conspiracy behind the scenes.  
她首先回想起的是他留下的最后一条语音信息，那时她并未意识到那是他以文字游戏形式留下的遗言，告诉她应该去哪里寻找碇所说的幕后阴谋的真相。

She then picked up one of the notes, and read off what appeared to be a transcript of a bugged conversation:  
她随即拿起一张便条，读着上面似乎是窃听对话的文字记录：

_TRANSCRIPT OF CONVERSATION - 05/24/2015 (check audio file)  
对话记录 - 2015 年 05 月 24 日（核对音频文件）  
Me: Undercover military bases are usually made underground. Am I wrong? At least in TV animations I used to watch. And so they dug here. "Undercover" doesn't fit the sunlight. And then?  
我：潜伏的军事基地通常建在地下，我说的不对吗？至少在我以前看的电视动画里是这样的。所以他们在这里挖掘。‘潜伏’这个词不适合阳光。然后呢？  
Source 64: Which one do you want to know? The outline of the Human Instrumentality Project? Or the truth of Second Impact? Or the aim of the ANGEL? Or the relationship between ADAM and LILITH and EVA? Or the identity of the men called the Committee? Or that of what we call "the spear"? Or the aim of Commander Ikari. Or. Or. Or. Or...  
源 64：你想知道哪一个？人类补完计划的概要？第二次冲击的真相？ANGEL 的目的？ADAM 和 LILITH 与 EVA 的关系？被称为委员会的那些人的身份？我们称之为‘长枪’的东西？碇司令的目的是什么？或者……或者……或者……  
Me: OK, that's enough. Cut it out. You must have got it. As long as you have a secret, a question will chase it.  
我：好了，够了。别说了。你肯定明白了。只要有秘密，问题就会随之而来。  
S64: You'd better take what you see for the truth.  
S64：你最好把所见即所得当作真相。  
Me: Am I wrong?  
S64: Well...  
Me: Now it is my turn. What is the door for, opening or closing?  
我：现在轮到我了。这扇门是用来开还是关的？  
S64: What do you think? Don't look at me like that.  
S64：你怎么看？别那样看着我。  
Me: This is a very important question for me. Especially in here, the deepest underground, there are so many doors.  
我：这个问题对我来说非常重要。尤其是在这里，最深的地底下，有这么多的门。  
S64: Well, well, well. What do you think?  
S64：嗯，嗯，嗯。你怎么看？  
Me: If you'd like to say, "I don't know", how about this instead? "The door should be opened by force." That's the reason. That's why I'm here.  
我：如果你想说“我不知道”，不如这样回答？“应该用武力打开门。”这就是原因。这就是我在这里的原因。_

_That's what Kaji was aiming for,_ Misato thought, before she picked another scrap of notepaper, on which a poem was scribbled in English and in his own longhand:  
这就是加持的目标，美里想，然后她又拿起一张便条纸，上面用英文潦草地写着一首诗，是他自己的笔迹：

_Blue is the color of the nerves  
蓝色是神经的颜色  
Purple is the color of the priest costume  
紫色是神父服装的颜色  
Red is the color of the arteries  
红色是动脉的颜色  
Dang, Dang, Dang  
The colors come into my sight  
色彩映入我的眼帘  
The illumination of a gunfight  
枪战中的照明  
Grey is the color of bombing  
灰色是轰炸的颜色  
Taste of rust spreading in my mouth  
铁锈味在口中蔓延  
Feeling rigid rocks beneath my feet  
Dang, Dang, Dang  
Drumming of primitive ages  
原始时代的鼓声  
Rhythm of insanity 疯狂的节奏  
Dance of the giants 巨人的舞蹈  
Holding guns of madness 握着疯狂的枪  
Dang, Dang, Dang  
When humans were not humans  
当人类还未成为人类  
When they were neighbor of beasts  
当他们与野兽为邻  
Memories were carved in their brain  
记忆刻印在他们脑海中  
With a knife of fury  
带着愤怒的刀刃  
Dang, Dang, Dang  
The arms  
Dang, Dang, Dang  
The legs  
Dang, Dang, Dang  
The eyes  
Dancing giants: colored in blue, purple, and red  
舞动的巨人：染着蓝、紫、红三色  
This is the village of the giants  
这里是巨人之村  
There live the gods expelled from heaven's seats  
那里居住着被逐出天庭的神祇  
Still is the sun shining above their heads  
阳光依旧照耀在他们头顶_

_How appropriate,_ Misato mused sadly. Kaji was canny to pick metaphors for the Evas, as he wondered about the true purpose of those beasts. She then recalled how Kaji, being a half-assed reincarnation of a hippie perhaps, used to dabble in poetry back in college, and even had some written and submitted for the varsity paper.  
多么贴切，美里悲伤地沉思。真嗣选择用 EVA 来比喻，确实机智，他一直在探寻那些巨兽的真正目的。她随即想起，或许是因为真嗣骨子里有几分嬉皮士的影子，大学时期他曾涉猎诗歌创作，甚至有作品被提交到校报发表。

Along with that poem was a undated comment in the next page, secured with a paper clip:  
那首诗的下一页夹着一张未注明日期的评论，用回形针固定着：

_This was totally different from the battlefields I have ever known. I've seen Korea, Iran, Vietnam, Falkland Islands, and so on. No wonder there is a difference between them. You know the battlefields, where the people hurt each other and stain the ground with their blood. But this place is completely different. In here soldiers may seem human to you, but in fact they are not. The wall prevents anyone without an AT Field from coming over. You see neither tanks nor fighters. Throwing a dark shadow on your eyes, there goes a Giant. A multiple human-shaped fatal weapon; that is a humanoid called EVANGELION. The enemy are unidentified creatures with Angels' name. Seeing them fighting, it looks like a mad combative game. It is Pankration at the risk of the fate of the fate of human beings. TOKYO-3 is made a stage for the battle. We know there lived the slaves killing each other for fame. Are we insane spectators doomed to watch this sad and cruel game?  
这与我所知的战场截然不同。我经历过朝鲜、伊朗、越南、福克兰群岛等地。难怪有所区别。你知道那些战场，人们互相伤害，用鲜血染红大地。但这个地方完全不同。在这里，士兵们对你来说可能看似人类，但实际上并非如此。墙壁阻止任何没有 AT 力场的人进入。你既看不到坦克也看不到战斗机。一个巨大的阴影投射在你的眼前，那就是被称为 EVANGELION 的多形态致命武器。敌人是被称为天使的未知生物。看着他们战斗，就像是一场疯狂的搏斗游戏。这是以人类命运为赌注的潘克拉辛。TOKYO-3 成为了这场战斗的舞台。我们知道那里曾有为了名誉而自相残杀的奴隶。我们是否注定要成为这场悲伤而残酷游戏的疯狂观众？_

There was a third note just behind that, and it read, turning out to be a short draft of a report about the Evas:  
在那后面还有第三张纸条，上面写着，似乎是一份关于 EVA 的简短报告草稿：

_EVA-00 Prototype. It is produced as an experimental model, the first Evangelion. The operator Rei Ayanami. Out of control right after starting and temporarily suspended. After suspension back to the battle field and terribly damaged. Afterward fixed the equipment and color coating, back again.  
EVA-00 原型机。作为实验型号生产，是第一台 Evangelion。驾驶员为绫波丽。启动后立即失控并暂时停机。停机后重返战场，遭受严重损坏。随后修复设备并重新涂装，再次投入使用。_

_EVA-01 Test Type. The model produced with actual fighting in view. The operator, Shinji Ikari. Sent to the battle field immediately without testing. Even though a great deal of damage and out of control, succeeded in destroying the enemy.  
EVA-01 试验型。以实战为目的生产的型号。驾驶员为碇真嗣。未经测试即直接投入战场。尽管遭受大量损伤并失控，仍成功摧毁了敌人。_

_EVA-02 The first production model. The operator, Asuka Langley Soryu. The model assembled in Germany.  
EVA-02 首批量产型。驾驶员为惣流·明日香·兰格雷。该型号在德国组装。_

_There are some peculiarities to be mentioned about EVA-01. It made unbelievable results in actual fighting. Besides Commander Ikari's attachment and persistence, this model seems to be primarily protected. But it has been sent to fight so many times. Their intention unidentified. There is a possibility that they let it go out of control intentionally. We have to be careful about exchanging experiment between these Evas. Some doubts about choosing the operators. Keep an eye on the Marduk Institute.  
关于 EVA-01，有一些特殊之处值得一提。它在实战中取得了令人难以置信的成果。除了碇司令的执着与偏爱，这台机体似乎得到了特别的保护。但它被派遣作战的次数如此之多，其意图仍不明朗。有可能是他们故意让其失控。我们在进行这些 EVA 之间的实验交换时必须谨慎。对于选择驾驶员的疑虑也需留意。密切关注 Marduk Institute 的动向。_

_P.S.: Check again the record of the accident of Gendo Ikari's wife, Yui.  
附注：再次核查碇源堂妻子，碇唯的事故记录。_

Now Misato scratched her head, and wondered who Yui Ikari was, as that name was underlined twice.  
此刻，美里挠了挠头，疑惑着碇唯是谁，因为这个名字被加了两道下划线。

Yui Ikari. Shinji's mother, a brilliant, legendary woman who, some old-timers here say, died in an accident years before Misato came here. The majority of personnel who worked here don't know her much except for the few remnants of Gehirn, especially Fuyutsuki, who offered her some tantalizing tidbits about Yui Ikari as they drank, watching the moon-dappled Hakone nightscape before them.  
碇唯。真嗣的母亲，一位才华横溢、传奇般的女性，据这里的一些老员工说，她在多年前的一次事故中去世，那时美里还未到这里。大多数在此工作的人员对她知之甚少，除了少数几位来自 Gehirn 的成员，尤其是冬月，他们在饮酒时，望着月光斑驳的箱根夜景，向她透露了一些关于碇唯的诱人细节。

_Yet… Exactly who was she?_ Misato asked herself as she set those notes aside, before she figured that Kaji might have something else on that woman, mixed somewhere in the box.  
然而…她究竟是谁？美里自问，将那些笔记放在一旁，心想加治或许在那个盒子里还藏有关于那个女人的其他信息。

There was yet another note… no, a poem in Kaji's handwriting, and Misato read closely until she got to the bottom:  
还有另一张纸条…不，是加治手写的一首诗，美里仔细阅读，直到最后一行：

…_You'll always end up in this city. Don't hope for things elsewhere:  
…你终将回到这座城市。别奢望别处的事物：  
there's no ship for you, there's no road.  
没有你的船，也没有你的路。  
Now that you've wasted your life here, in this small corner,  
既然你已在此小角落虚度一生，  
you've destroyed it everywhere in the world.  
你已将它摧毁于世界各地。_

_C.P. Cavafy (1863-1933), The City  
C.P. 卡瓦菲斯（1863-1933），《城市》  
(Translated by Edmund Keeley & Philip Sherrard)  
（由埃德蒙·基利与菲利普·谢拉德翻译）_

The poem, probably quoted from a book, was a perfect pick, very appropriate to describe Shinji's character, and by extension, Misato's own personality, that of trying to run away, shirk responsibility, turn away their eyes… and yet couldn't escape at all that they're all forced to face the music.  
这首诗，很可能摘自某本书，选得恰到好处，非常贴切地描绘了真嗣的性格，进而也反映了美里自己的个性——那种试图逃避、推卸责任、转移视线……却又无法真正逃脱，被迫面对现实的境况。

Probing further into the depths of the note-filled box, Misato's hand found a 4-gigabyte SD card in its protective shell and pulled it out. With two fingers, she held it up in the light and stared, wondering if this could have much in store than she ever cobbled up while trying to uncover the mysteries surrounding NERV…  
美里继续深入探索这个装满笔记的盒子，她的手触到了一个 4GB 的 SD 卡，外壳保护得很好，她将其抽出。用两根手指夹着，在灯光下凝视，思索着这张卡里是否藏有比她以往试图揭开 NERV 谜团时所拼凑出的更多秘密……

Perhaps this memory card held more than the little one that Kaji had left for her.  
或许这张记忆卡里藏有的，远不止加持留给她的那一点点。

Whoever made up that old saw, _dead men tell tales,_ rang true now, and Misato was grateful for it.  
那句古老的谚语，死人会说话，如今看来确实不假，美里对此深感庆幸。

"This," Misato whispered to herself, before she set the memory card aside, and reached for another piece of paper… but then she hesitated to think.  
“这个，”美里低声自语，随后将记忆卡放在一旁，伸手去拿另一张纸……但随即她犹豫了，陷入了思考。

_Why I can't just let these kids know? Why hide all of this?_ She pondered.  
为什么我不能直接让这些孩子知道？为什么要隐藏这一切？她沉思着。

_It's been long that they were center of it all, yet… If they don't know their true purpose for being here, then what's the point of withholding all of Kaji's secrets from them?  
他们曾是这一切的中心，然而……如果他们不知道自己在这里的真正目的，那么对他们隐瞒所有加持的秘密又有什么意义呢？_

Misato thought of Asuka's long association with Kaji, and thus she, like her, might also a heir to all of that man's secrets. Then perhaps Kaji have probably trusted Shinji just as he gave the same gesture towards her, and thus he also has the right to hear the truth.  
美里想到了明日香与加持长期的关系，因此她，就像明日香一样，可能也是那个男人所有秘密的继承者。那么或许加持可能同样信任真嗣，就像他曾经向她展示的那样，因此他也有权听到真相。

_No,_ Misato shook her head. _I'm not the only one who deserves to have this… This might be the right time that they must learn more, for what Kaji had left for me is a forewarning._  
不，美里摇了摇头。我不是唯一一个应该拥有这个的人……这可能是他们必须了解更多的时候了，因为加持留给我的，是一个警告。

---

Still at the lounge, and sitting on couches, Kaworu and Rei explained to Shinji and Asuka on how they found the box, and then the Fifth Children asked, "Tell me, does Misato keep a… what do you call this? An answering machine?"  
"仍在休息室里，坐在沙发上的渚薰和绫波丽向真嗣和明日香解释他们是如何找到那个盒子的，随后第五适格者问道：“告诉我，美里是不是有一个……你们怎么称呼这个？答录机？””

Shinji, reclined almost lazily, nodded. "Well, yeah… But… She hid it after Kaji died," he answered. "Why?"  
"真嗣几乎懒洋洋地靠在椅背上，点了点头。“嗯，是的……但……加治死后她就把它藏起来了，”他回答道。“为什么？””

Kaworu would like to say how he knew about Kaji's last message, that it devastated Misato, not knowing at the time that it was also coded to ask Misato to find his treasure trove.  
"渚薰本想说他是如何知道加治的最后留言的，那条留言让美里心碎，当时他并不知道那条留言还暗含着让美里找到他的宝藏的请求。”

The gray-haired boy merely shrugged. "Just curious," he said, but decided that a subject change would be fine. "Say… I saw you two blushing, so again, what's going on between you two? What's the big deal?"  
灰白头发的男孩只是耸了耸肩。“只是好奇，”他说，但觉得换个话题也不错。“说起来……我看到你们俩脸红了，所以再次问一下，你们俩之间到底怎么了？有什么大不了的吗？”

Asuka and Shinji blinked, and then replied, "Nothing."  
明日香和真嗣眨了眨眼，然后回答：“没什么。”

Kaworu smiled. "A secret, perhaps."  
薰微笑道：“或许是个秘密。”

"Close enough," Asuka answered as she, having unshorn her shoes, tried to crack the knuckles of her toes against the tiled floor. "Lovers' secret. Can't tell you or I might knock you down cold."  
"差不多吧，" 明日香答道，她已经脱掉了鞋子，试图用脚趾敲打瓷砖地面来活动关节。"恋人的秘密。告诉你了，我可能会把你打晕。"

"Sorry for being too intrusive," Kaworu apologized, and then he chuckled.  
"抱歉，问得太多了，" 渚薰道歉后轻声笑了起来。

Asuka shook her head instead. _He's poking his nose into too many things,_ she thought.  
明日香摇了摇头。他想插手的事情太多了，她心想。

But just as she was about to empty her bottle of Calpis, Misato showed up, standing at the lounge door_._  
但就在她准备喝光她的可尔必思时，美里出现了，站在休息室的门口。

All four Children turned their gaze at their superior officer and Shinji asked, "What's wrong?"  
四个孩子都转向他们的上级指挥官，真嗣问道：“怎么了？”

Misato sighed and then said, "You guys have the right to know. Let's go, for I want to show you what's inside that box."  
美里叹了口气，然后说：“你们有权知道。走吧，我想让你们看看那盒子里是什么。”

---

After Fuyutsuki spilled the beans on what he knew of SEELE, Hamamoto could only manage wonderment right on his face as the Sub-Commander gave him a moment to mull upon.  
在冬月透露了他所知的关于 SEELE 的信息后，Hamamoto 脸上不禁流露出惊异之色，副指挥官给了他片刻时间来思考。

"So… What you're saying is… We're working for a bunch of geezers with an agenda?" the Second Section director asked.  
“所以……你的意思是……我们是在为一群有自己议程的老家伙工作？”第二部门主任问道。

"That's right," Fuyutsuki replied.  
“没错，”冬月回答道。

Hamamoto snorted. "I didn't know that there was some truth to what those conspiracy theory nuts tell about for years," he said. "But tell me, what's the use for the Human Instrumentality Plan and why?"  
浜本哼了一声。“我以前还以为那些阴谋论疯子说的东西都是胡扯，”他说，“但告诉我，人类补完计划有什么用，为什么？”

"Honestly, in a nutshell they wanted a perfect world."  
“老实说，简而言之，他们想要一个完美的世界。”

"Impossible. I've heard of such bullshit, mostly from idealists who thought they could create the perfect society, a paradise on earth, yet they all fell short of their own expectations that more often they either got bored or killed themselves, because men are individualistic. About the only perfect world one will get is when their number is up… the big sleep, and the forever dream on the other side. Now what shall we must do?"  
“不可能。我听过这种鬼话，大多是些理想主义者，以为自己能创造一个完美的社会，人间天堂，结果他们都达不到自己的期望，往往不是感到厌倦就是自杀了，因为人都是个人主义的。唯一能得到的完美世界，就是他们命数已尽的时候……长眠，以及彼岸永恒的梦境。现在我们该做什么？”

The old man looked at his watch, a rather beat-up Seiko chronograph he kept since graduation from college, a gift from his long-dead parents.  
老人看了看他的手表，那是一块相当破旧的精工计时表，自大学毕业以来就一直佩戴着，是已故父母送给他的礼物。

"I'd say we maintain yellow alert status… and half of our security forces will have to be on their toes," he recommended.  
“我认为我们应保持黄色警戒状态……并且一半的安全人员必须时刻保持警惕，”他建议道。

"With weapons?"

"Yes. Loaded at all times. We can't allow to go slack this time."  
“是的。随时待命。这次我们不能松懈。”

"Okay, sir. That'll be done," Hamamoto accepted as he picked up a pen and scribbled a note for the all assigned platoon leaders to follow later. He also added a reminder that all vital installations – communications, countermeasures, gates and all – will have to be kept on guard, even if it meant there may be no break until tomorrow morning.  
“好的，先生。这就安排下去，”Hamamoto 拿起笔，迅速为所有指定的排长做了笔记，要求他们稍后执行。他还提醒说，所有重要设施——通讯、反制措施、大门等——都必须保持警戒，即便这意味着可能直到明天早上都没有休息时间。

Fuyutsuki nodded, before he said, "First of all, I still have some respect for your work, even if it's imperfect."  
冬月点了点头，然后说道：“首先，我仍然对你的工作表示尊重，尽管它并不完美。”

Hamamoto nodded. "I'm aware of that, sir."  
Hamamoto 点头回应：“我明白，长官。”

"You may have done some mistakes before, but forget all that, for there's a clear and present danger, one that we don't think we'll be able to avoid."  
"你或许曾犯过一些错误，但忘掉那些吧，因为现在有一个清晰且迫在眉睫的危险，我们不认为能够避开它。"

The old director blinked. "What do you mean?"  
老局长眨了眨眼。"什么意思？"

"To be frank, have you have anything against me?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
"坦白说，你对我有什么不满吗？" 冬月问道。"

"No," Hamamoto said. "Of all leaders I came across in my lifetime, I think you're neither political nor ambitious. Instead, you're a different character, an intellectual; a man like you would've preferred to be in the background yet circumstances force you to be a leader. You're a doer, more of a teacher, and… you don't terrorize your subordinates. Finally, about the only vice you still do is reading."  
"不，" 羽茂说，"在我一生中遇到的所有领导者中，我认为你既不政治化也不野心勃勃。相反，你是一个与众不同的人物，一个知识分子；像你这样的人本宁愿在幕后，但环境迫使你成为领导者。你是一个实干家，更像是一位教师，而且……你不会恐吓你的下属。最后，你唯一的缺点可能就是阅读了。"

"Thank you," Fuyutsuki said, took a breath and then questioned, "So… Do you trust my judgment this time?"  
"谢谢，" 冬月说，深吸了一口气，然后问道，"那么……这次你相信我的判断吗？"

"I do now," Hamamoto answered, nodding, but he wanted the old man to go straight to the point. "What do you want me to do?"  
"我现在相信了，" 羽茂回答，点头，但他希望这位老人能直奔主题，"你想让我做什么？"

This time Fuyutsuki switched to a whisper and said, "This may border on treason, but… I want your people to keep a close watch on the Commander, and if he's about to do something that could possibly imperil humanity... as much as I am his right hand, I'm afraid that sooner or later we will have to protect him from himself."  
这一次，冬月切换成了耳语，说道：“这或许已接近叛国，但……我希望你们的人密切监视司令，如果他即将做出可能危及人类的事情……尽管我是他的得力助手，我担心迟早我们得保护他免受自己的伤害。”

Inwardly Fuyutsuki didn't want to say the word _arrest_, and he felt torn inside on deciding the best course of action to end this madness, but it seemed that Hamamoto caught on it by watching the old man's body language, facial and lip movements, showing hesitation, and the old director asked, "You… You want us to stop Commander Ikari?"  
内心深处，冬月并不想说出“逮捕”这个词，他在决定结束这场疯狂的最佳行动方案时感到内心撕裂，但似乎滨本通过观察老人的肢体语言、面部和唇部动作，察觉到了他的犹豫，老局长问道：“你……你想让我们阻止碇司令吗？”

"If possible, yes," Fuyutsuki said.  
“如果可能的话，是的。”冬月回答道。

Hamamoto sighed and he said, "Give me a few minutes to decide, sir."  
Hamamoto 叹了口气，说道：“请给我几分钟时间考虑，先生。”

Fuyutsuki nodded, as Hamamoto looked up to the ceiling and pondered.  
Fuyutsuki 点了点头，Hamamoto 则抬头望向天花板，陷入沉思。

On one hand Fuyutsuki was ordering him a command that amounted to treason, short of a palace coup, a mutiny within the ranks, to betray his only closest friend and pupil… but on the other hand, Hamamoto wondered if Ikari was leading them all to the wrong direction, and what if they didn't do the right thing once it turned out that this Human Instrumentality Plan could be a sham, a false promise, or the end of everything?  
一方面，Fuyutsuki 命令他做的事情近乎叛国，除了宫廷政变，就是背叛他唯一的挚友和学生……但另一方面，Hamamoto 不禁怀疑 Ikari 是否正带领他们走向错误的方向，如果人类补完计划最终被证明是一场骗局，一个虚假的承诺，甚至是万劫不复的结局，他们又该如何是好？

He recalled his previous readings of history, of monarchs and dictators who promised prosperity and happiness to people under their rule, Pied Pipers with the iron fist while playing the music of lies, and then later led them to ruin either with economic or political instability or war. Hitler and Mussolini were such examples, followed by a succession of communist strongmen who, in their lust for power in the name of idealism, drove their people to their deaths, destruction and poverty.  
他回忆起以往阅读的历史，那些君主和独裁者承诺在其统治下带给人民繁荣与幸福，他们如同铁腕的吹笛人，却演奏着谎言的乐章，最终将人民引向经济或政治动荡、甚至战争的毁灭。希特勒和墨索里尼便是这样的例子，随后是一连串以理想主义之名追求权力的共产主义强人，他们将人民推向死亡、毁灭与贫困。

Was Gendo Ikari such a man?  
碇源堂会是这样的人吗？

Time and again, Hamamoto made character analyses of the people he worked with or he kept tabs on, and in this case Ikari was a man who kept to himself most of his secrets, had a single-minded goal, and…  
一次次地，Hamamoto 对他共事或关注的人进行性格分析，而在这个案例中，碇源堂是一个深藏不露、目标明确且……

He thought of something: does Ikari's character flaw has to do with the death of his wife?  
他突然想到：碇的性格缺陷是否与妻子的去世有关？

No doubt, Hamamoto thought. It's one thing to be inspired to become a better person after the death of a loved one, yet another if it's deep-seated revenge against fate.  
毫无疑问，滨本想。在所爱之人去世后被激励成为更好的人是一回事，但如果是对命运深藏的复仇，那又是另一回事了。

Hamamoto once remembered, in his few days as a director, secretly snooping on Ikari's personal background, trying to see if that man had any skeletons in the closet, and indeed he found some, including the Commander's violent past history, with a dysfunctional family, a fling with alcohol, yet even with such a flawed life, and a long record of assault and battery in the National Police files, he somehow managed to enter Kyoto University with smarts and fought all the way to win his doctorate.  
滨本曾记得，在他担任导演的短短几天里，他偷偷调查过碇的个人背景，试图看看那个人是否有不可告人的秘密，确实发现了一些，包括指挥官过去的暴力历史，一个功能失调的家庭，一段酗酒的过往，尽管生活如此缺陷重重，还有国家警察档案中长长的殴打记录，他不知怎么地凭借聪明才智进入了京都大学，并一路奋斗赢得了博士学位。

It could only be done with a little influence, as he had a very influential uncle who was then high up in the government and thus pulled the right strings in the university, the National Police and city hall. The same thing happened when Ikari, then prior to the establishment of NERV, was later implicated in what appeared to be a major accident involving his wife, and Ikari was absolved of all charges of negligence and mismanagement.  
这只能通过一点影响力来实现，因为他有一个非常有权势的叔叔，当时在政府中身居高位，因此在大学、国家警察和市政厅拉动了正确的关系。同样的事情发生在碇源堂身上，那时 NERV 尚未成立，他后来卷入了一起看似重大的事故，涉及他的妻子，而碇源堂被免除了所有疏忽和管理不善的指控。

But Ikari remained, in Hamamoto's opinion, a driven man who was willing to cut corners, cheat, steal and lie just to get what he wanted, and more. Ikari was also a no-nonsense man, cold and clinical, who had no qualms about doing what guts it took to build a fledgling small organization into an agency that was practically a nation and a law unto itself; he had no sentimentality nor feelings towards his son or that Langley girl, not even flinching or blinking as this young man was forced to go through pain and suffering at the cost of NERV's advancement … yet Ikari invested much of his attention towards Ayanami, as though he made himself a father figure for that girl…  
但在滨本看来，碇源堂依然是一个不择手段、愿意走捷径、欺骗、偷窃和撒谎以达到目的的人，甚至更多。碇源堂也是一个不讲情面的人，冷酷而临床，毫不犹豫地采取一切必要手段，将一个初创的小组织打造成一个几乎自成一国、自立法律的机构；他对他的儿子或那个兰格雷女孩没有丝毫情感，即使这个年轻人被迫承受痛苦和苦难，以换取 NERV 的进步，碇源堂也毫不退缩或眨眼……然而，碇源堂却将大量注意力投向了绫波，仿佛他为自己塑造了一个那个女孩的父亲形象……

Hamamoto groaned at how his thoughts had veered that far, and told himself, _What kind of a father who neglects his son?_  
滨本叹息自己的思绪竟飘得如此之远，自问：“什么样的父亲会忽视自己的儿子？”

He then recalled that Joseph Stalin, during World War II, was even said to tell his subordinates callously that he had no son after being informed of that young artillery officer – his son Yaakov – was captured and imprisoned in the hands of the Nazis.  
他随即想起，约瑟夫·斯大林在二战期间，据说曾冷酷地告诉下属，得知他的儿子雅科夫——一名年轻的炮兵军官——被俘并囚禁在纳粹手中后，他已无子。

Oh, yeah, speaking of the Nazis… Hitler, prior to becoming the lunatic leader of a short-lived Third Reich, was a mediocre painter with a huge ego problem… and every strongman possessed past history of personal failure and anger, embittered and lowly, outraged at fate, wanting to be better than most… but most of all, they wanted the masses to worship them as demigods, as if their ascension to absolute power would erase all of their transgressions away and then do as they wished, either reward a friend or destroy an enemy, with total impunity.  
哦，对了，说到纳粹……希特勒在成为短暂第三帝国的疯狂领袖之前，是一个自负严重的平庸画家……每一个强人都有过个人失败和愤怒的历史，心怀怨恨，地位低下，对命运感到愤怒，渴望超越大多数人……但最重要的是，他们希望大众将他们奉为半神，仿佛他们登上绝对权力的高峰会抹去所有罪行，然后随心所欲地行事，无论是奖赏朋友还是摧毁敌人，都毫无顾忌。

The parallels between those despots and Ikari were thus startling that Hamamoto now shuddered at his own conclusion… the perfect ingredients necessary to create a _false prophet._  
那些暴君与碇司令之间的相似之处如此惊人，以至于滨口现在对自己的结论感到不寒而栗……创造一个假先知的完美要素。

A madman.

And what kept Hamamoto to his post, however, right until this very moment, was his loyalty to the Commander, for he admired his no-nonsense approach to everything he did, without hesitation, remorse nor conscience. All for the common good, he was told.  
然而，滨口坚守岗位直至此刻的原因，是他对指挥官的忠诚，因为他钦佩指挥官处理一切事务时的果断、毫不犹豫、不后悔也不留情面。一切为了公共利益，他是这么被告知的。

But the truth that Fuyutsuki told him today… has finally convinced him that Ikari was going too far; what would happen if Ikari led them to utter death and destruction in the end, much in the same way that Japan and Germany did to themselves back in the last war?  
但今天冬月告诉他的真相……终于让他相信碇司令走得太远了；如果碇司令最终带领他们走向彻底的死亡和毁灭，就像日本和德国在上次战争中自取灭亡那样，会发生什么？

And what about this conglomerate called SEELE? Are they leading this world to that same conclusion? A possible second renaissance of mankind or…  
而这个名为 SEELE 的集团又如何？他们是否正引导这个世界走向同样的结局？人类可能的第二次复兴，还是……

Doomsday?

Hamamoto took a deep breath and voiced out the biggest decision of his life, as he was now willing to break the rules he and his department had enforced for years.  
Hamamoto 深吸了一口气，说出了他一生中最大的决定，他现在愿意打破自己和部门多年来一直遵守的规则。

"Okay, sir… But when?" Hamamoto asked.  
“好的，先生……但什么时候？”Hamamoto 问道。

"When I tell you so," Fuyutsuki answered. "When the opportunity presents itself… But all in all, I'd rather live in a world steeped in sin, than live in the future they might soon give to us and against our will."  
"当我这么告诉你时，" 冬月回答道。"当机会来临时…但总的来说，我宁愿生活在一个充满罪恶的世界，也不愿生活在他们可能很快强加给我们的未来，违背我们的意愿。"

"You're right," Hamamoto agreed.  
"你说得对，" 羽山同意道。"

Back in their quarters, they all gathered around Misato's laptop, as she inserted the SD card into the slot found on the side, accessed the card and, in a directory listing of the card's contents, found a single video file among a bunch of compressed ZIP files. Curiously, Misato opened the file with a media player, and in playback they found themselves watching Kaji staring back at them onscreen.  
回到他们的房间，他们围坐在美里笔记本电脑旁，她将 SD 卡插入侧面插槽，访问了卡片，在卡片内容的目录列表中，发现了一个视频文件夹杂在一堆压缩的 ZIP 文件中。好奇之下，美里用媒体播放器打开了文件，播放时他们发现自己正在屏幕上看着屏幕上的加持。

With the customary light-blue shirt and loosened tie, stubble on his chin, the ponytailed hair, and a calm look on his face, Kaji was drinking from a can of UCC Black, like a parody of a TV advertisement of the same coffee brand. Misato also took note of the time and date of the recording – it was more than two weeks ago, and the time displayed by Kaji's camera was 6:45 in the morning. As for his surroundings, he was in the kitchen, with the morning sun streaming in from the balcony, shining on the whitewashed walls; whether it was a hotel or an apartment or somewhere… Misato couldn't tell. Just behind him, his service automatic H&K USP 9mm – exactly the same model as her sidearm – was on the kitchen counter, with the 14-round double-stack clip and a Galco holster besides it, and some cleaning tools surrounding the weapon.  
身着惯常的浅蓝色衬衫，领带松散，下巴留着胡茬，马尾辫束起，面容平静，加持正从一罐 UCC 黑咖啡中啜饮，宛如该咖啡品牌电视广告的滑稽模仿。美里也注意到了录像的时间和日期——那已是两周多以前，加持的相机显示时间为早上 6 点 45 分。至于他的周围环境，他身处厨房，晨光从阳台洒入，照在粉刷过的白墙上；无论是酒店、公寓还是其他地方……美里无法判断。就在他身后，他的公务用自动手枪 H&K USP 9mm——与她的配枪型号完全相同——放在厨房台面上，旁边是 14 发双排弹匣和一只 Galco 枪套，以及围绕着武器的一些清洁工具。

"_Hi, Katsuragi…"_ Kaji began, before he made a grin that lit up his face. He looked as if the prospect of his later fate in Oda's hands was no big deal – death was, sadly, part of his occupational hazard. _"If you're watching this, then I'm afraid that I'm dead by now."_  
“嗨，葛城……”加持开口道，随即露出了照亮他面庞的笑容。他看起来似乎并不在意自己后来落在织田手中的命运——死亡，悲哀地，是他职业风险的一部分。“如果你在看这段录像，那么恐怕我现在已经不在人世了。”

Misato grimaced, but Kaworu asked as he watched the man arrange his notes on the counter, "Is that Kaji?"  
"美里皱了皱眉，但看着那人整理柜台上的笔记，渚薰问道：“那是加持吗？””

The woman nodded. "Yeah… He's speaking from the grave."  
"女子点了点头。“嗯……他这是在从坟墓里发言。””

"I see," Rei said.  
“我明白了，”绫波说。

"_If you have found this box buried beneath my watermelons and flowers, and everything inside's intact,"_ Kaji continued, _"it means that you finally figured out the last message I made on your answering machine."_  
"如果你发现这个盒子被埋在我的西瓜和花丛之下，而且里面的东西完好无损，" 加持继续说道，"这意味着你终于破解了我留在你答录机上的最后一条留言。"

"Thank you," Misato whispered.  
"谢谢你，" 美里轻声说道。"

"_And if you have Shinji and Asuka with you," Kaji went on, "no problem; they also have the right to know what's happening here… and oh, Asuka, don't worry about me, okay?"_  
"如果你身边有真嗣和明日香，" 加持接着说，"没关系；他们也有权知道这里发生了什么……哦，明日香，别为我担心，好吗？"

"Okay," Asuka said as Shinji held her hand for emotional support.  
“好的，”明日香说道，此时真嗣握着她的手以给予情感支持。

"_Ah… and Shinji, if you're watching with Katsuragi, I hope what I'll say will answer some of your gnawing questions, especially as you've been wondering for so long as to what's driving your father to become what he is today."_  
“啊……还有真嗣，如果你和葛城一起观看的话，我希望我接下来要说的话能解答你一些困扰已久的问题，尤其是关于你父亲为何会变成今天这个样子的原因。”

The young man nodded in response.  
年轻人点头回应。

Onscreen, Kaji paused to finish his coffee, drinking straight, and then made a three-point shot with the can into an unseen wastebasket. They could all hear the dull thud of the can hitting the bottom of that basket, followed by Kaji's upraised arms.  
屏幕上，加持停下动作喝完咖啡，直接对着罐子喝，随后将空罐一扔，精准地投进了一个看不见的废纸篓。他们都能听到罐子撞击底部发出的沉闷声响，接着是加持举起双臂的画面。

"_Three points!"_ Kaji cheered, before he turned to face the camera again, took a breath as he picked up his notes, and continued. "Now… Let's see, what I'm gonna have to tell you today… Oh, yeah, the tell-all that you're all been waiting for.  
“三分！”加持欢呼道，然后转身再次面对镜头，深吸一口气，拿起笔记继续说道，“现在……让我想想，今天我得告诉你们些什么呢……哦，对了，你们一直期待的大爆料。”

"_To begin with, you see, the one thing that bothered me now, as I woke up, was my ID card. Yeah, each time I look at it, it looks like blood was printed on it. Kind of a… premonition._  
“首先，你们知道，现在让我醒来后感到困扰的一件事，就是我的身份证。没错，每次我看它，都像是上面印着血迹。有点像是……预感。”

"_Now to make things clear, you guessed well for whom I was working for: the government and NERV… Yet I also left out the fact that I'm supposed to work on behalf of the Committee, which by now, you have figured out who's behind it… So that makes me a triple agent, doing things and little errands for these big boys."_  
"现在把事情说清楚，你猜对了我是为谁工作的：政府和 NERV……不过我也隐瞒了一个事实，那就是我应该代表委员会工作，而到现在，你已经猜到背后是谁了……所以这让我成了一个三重间谍，为这些大人物做些事情和小差事。"

"I know," Misato acknowledged, as Kaji looked to his notes and spoke.  
"我知道，"美里承认道，而此时加持看着他的笔记说道。"

"_My supposed employers are known under the name SEELE, and the main man running it for years, his name is Keel Lorenz, chairman of the Human Instrumentality Project."_  
"我名义上的雇主被称为 SEELE，多年来掌管它的主要人物，名叫基尔·洛伦兹，人类补完计划委员会的主席。"

As he looked on, Kaworu said nothing except to nod.  
他看着，渚薰一言不发，只是点了点头。

While Rei watched nonchalantly, Shinji and Asuka leaned forward, as if they wanted to make sure they were hearing everything correctly.  
丽淡然旁观，真嗣和明日香则前倾着身子，仿佛要确保自己听得一字不漏。

"_Officially,_" Kaji said, _"Lorenz is the president of Hegelmann Holdings, which encompasses much of Europe's industries, anywhere from arms production to electronics, telecommunications, heavy industry, transportation, aerospace, mining and petroleum, real estate, banking, food production and consumer products… well, everything, especially pharmaceuticals and genetic engineering."_  
“正式来说，”加持道，“洛伦兹是黑格尔曼控股集团的总裁，该集团涵盖了欧洲大部分产业，从军火生产到电子、电信、重工业、交通、航空航天、采矿和石油、房地产、银行业、食品生产和消费品……嗯，几乎无所不包，尤其是制药和基因工程。”

Misato picked up several photos from the box, possibly taken by Kaji through telephoto lens, which showed what appeared to be a man in his eighties, wearing impossibly large wrap-around glasses as he was being ushered by his aides into a waiting stretch limo, flanked by two large SUVs front and aft. Written on one photo was the name "Lorenz".  
美里从箱子里拿起几张照片，可能是加持用长焦镜头拍摄的，照片上显示的是一个八十多岁的男子，戴着一副大得离谱的环绕式眼镜，在助手们的簇拥下进入一辆等候的加长豪华轿车，前后各有两辆大型 SUV 护卫。其中一张照片上写着名字“洛伦兹”。

"_To the public, he's a former refugee who's been around for more than fifty years… or even more, as he had no official birth records, probably destroyed during the last war. My research, however, suggests that he was a son of a Dresden military industrialist, in cahoots with Hitler as one of the Nazi financial backers back in the 1930s, and as expected by the regime, he joined the Hitler Youth, then later on found himself fighting the Russians in Berlin, until he surrendered and was imprisoned for a few months before, because of his bad back, was released for humanitarian reasons… perhaps someone up in the Kremlin had pulled some strings, but I'll never know._  
对公众来说，他是一个五十多年来一直存在的难民……甚至更久，因为他没有官方的出生记录，可能是在上次战争中被销毁了。然而，我的研究显示，他是德累斯顿一位军事工业家的儿子，在 1930 年代与希特勒勾结，成为纳粹的财政支持者之一，正如政权所期望的那样，他加入了希特勒青年团，后来发现自己正在柏林与俄国人作战，直到他投降并在监狱里关了几个月，因为他的背部问题，出于人道主义原因被释放……也许是克里姆林宫的某个人动了手脚，但我永远不会知道。

"_After the war, Lorenz then emigrated to the United States, got into Yale with a double degree in medicine and biology, graduated and stayed with a pharmaceutical firm for five years, then went back to Germany, only to see that the Russians had taken over half of the country, including his hometown. So instead, in Stuttgart and at the height of the Cold War, he and several new partners took over Hegelmann, then a struggling medical firm, and turned it into a major pharmaceutical player._  
"战后，洛伦兹随后移民到美国，以双学位医学和生物学进入耶鲁大学，毕业后在一家制药公司工作了五年，然后回到德国，却发现俄罗斯人已经占领了半个国家，包括他的家乡。于是，在冷战高峰期的斯图加特，他与几位新合伙人接管了当时陷入困境的赫格尔曼医疗公司，并将其转变为一家主要的制药企业。

Kaji took a breather, and he said, "I'd like to tell you more, but to cut the story short, Lorenz built an empire, piece by piece, one at a time… He's that patient, you know.  
卡吉喘了口气，说道：“我想告诉你更多，但简而言之，洛伦兹一步步建立了一个帝国……他非常有耐心，你知道的。”

"_Behind the scenes, however, Lorenz is currently the twenty-forth High Master of SEELE, as the position is either inherited or a new leader is selected by vote from the membership, depending on the choice of his predecessor. The eleven members of the circle and their immediate successors, on the other hand, are hand-picked on the basis of their extreme wealth, knowledge and wide-ranging influence, and their ability for discretion, which is why some members don't quite appear in the news."_  
"然而，幕后洛伦兹目前是 SEELE 的第二十四任高级大师，该职位要么是继承的，要么由会员投票选出新的领导人，这取决于前任的选择。而圆桌会议的十一位成员及其直接继任者，则是基于他们的巨额财富、知识、广泛影响力以及保密能力被精心挑选的，这也是为什么一些成员不太出现在新闻中的原因。

Indeed, in Misato's hands was a paper containing the membership roster of the entire Committee; some of them were familiar, and others were obscure. One or two were well-known two-digit billionaires in America; a name of a former KGB officer who is now the head of a Russian energy company; another was a diamond magnate in South Africa; a sheik in the Gulf States, known for his immense petroleum holdings; and more names went on… the document alone was explosive, and dimly Misato remembered that there was a similar treatise that allegedly claimed that a religious sect was a part of a conspiracy for world domination.  
确实，在美里手中的是一份包含整个委员会成员名单的文件；其中一些名字耳熟能详，另一些则鲜为人知。有一两位是美国知名的亿万富翁；一个曾是克格勃官员，如今是俄罗斯能源公司的掌门人；另一个是南非的钻石大亨；还有一位海湾国家的酋长，以其庞大的石油资产闻名；名单还在继续……这份文件本身就极具爆炸性，美里隐约记得曾有一篇类似的论文声称某个宗教团体参与了世界统治的阴谋。

As if he heard her thoughts, Kaji said, _"Forget anything you know from the conspiracy buffs; the Illuminati, the 'New World Order', the so-called 'Protocols'… are nothing but fairy tales compared to SEELE, as they actually have this insanely big-ass power to decide world events, tell the major powers what they should be doing, and of course toy around with the United Nations and NERV, and if I'm dead now because of what I'm telling you right now, then my death only serves to validate the extent of their control._  
仿佛听到了她的心声，加持说道，“忘掉那些阴谋论者告诉你的东西；光照派、‘新世界秩序’、所谓的‘锡安长老会纪要’……与 SEELE 相比，这些不过是童话故事，他们实际上拥有决定世界事件的疯狂权力，告诉各大国该做什么，当然还能操纵联合国和 NERV，如果我现在因为告诉你这些而丧命，那我的死只会证明他们控制力的深广。”

"_Just as I thought I don't know much about them back when I was starting to work for those geezers, to be sure somehow I managed to obtain in Vienna a copy of a document containing their history. It's gone now, as it was damned old, made of papyrus, and falling apart, but I was able to scan it, page by page… It's called_ The Book of Seven Eyes_. Besides, I have also have some more recent information to support it."_  
“正如我当初开始为那些老家伙工作时所想，我对他们的了解并不多，但不知怎的，我在维也纳设法弄到了一份包含他们历史的文件副本。现在它已经消失了，因为它非常古老，是用纸莎草纸制成的，而且正在破碎，但我能够一页一页地扫描它……它被称为《七眼之书》。此外，我还有一些更近期的信息来支持它。”

Promptly Misato set the media player to 'pause', and went back to the window listing the files in the memory card; indeed, one large ZIP file – named _Seven Eyes_ – had hundreds of scanned pages in PNG format. Misato decided that this file will be read later, before she resumed playback, watching Kaji pick up several more of his notes, and started to talk about his own cut-down version of SEELE's voluminous life history.  
米萨托迅速将媒体播放器设置为‘暂停’，然后回到内存卡中文件列表的窗口；确实，一个名为“七眼”的大型 ZIP 文件包含了数百张 PNG 格式的扫描页。米萨托决定稍后再阅读这个文件，然后她恢复了播放，看着卡吉拿起他的几份笔记，开始谈论他自己对 SEELE 庞大历史的一个精简版本。

SEELE began life as a secret society and a religious order during the medieval Dark Ages. The first High Master was a German noble known as, according to _The Seven Eyes_, Heinrich Bayard, who was simultaneously an alchemist and a fastidious scholar. Out of a need for preservation, in the face of widespread ignorance, he and his followers created the circle whose objectives were to seek out and preserve knowledge, to exert influence, and to obtain ultimate divinity of man.  
SEELE 起源于中世纪黑暗时代的一个秘密社团和宗教组织。首任高阶大师据称是《七眼》中记载的德国贵族海因里希·贝亚德，他同时是一位炼金术士和严谨的学者。面对普遍的无知，为了保存知识，他和他的追随者们创立了这个圈子，其目标在于寻求和保存知识，施加影响力，并最终实现人类的终极神性。

Their dogma was the Path to Adam Kadmon — that is, the approaching of a divinity both ageless and undying.  
他们的教义是通往亚当·卡德蒙的道路——即接近一种永恒不朽的神性。

In the same manuscript, SEELE also obtained untold amounts of wealth, purportedly the remains of King Solomon's treasure cache rescued from the sacking of Jerusalem, and the bulk of scrolls from what used to be the Library of Alexandria also became their other wealth; the circle used this wealth of riches and knowledge to bring the other kingdoms and orders under their control while maintaining total secrecy; any attempts at exposure resulted in death to the offender.  
在同一手稿中，SEELE 还获得了难以估量的财富，据说是从耶路撒冷被劫掠中抢救出的所罗门王宝藏的遗留，以及原本属于亚历山大图书馆的大量卷轴也成为了他们的另一笔财富；这个圈子利用这些财富和知识，将其他王国和组织置于其控制之下，同时保持完全的秘密；任何试图揭露的行为都会导致违规者丧命。

_The Seven Eyes_ stated that SEELE was partly responsible for the Renaissance, in which they gave out small tidbits of their extraordinary knowledge to the Italian princes, who in turn capitalized on it by means of study and dissemination.  
七眼组织指出，SEELE 对文艺复兴负有部分责任，他们向意大利诸侯透露了一些非凡的知识碎片，而这些诸侯则通过学习和传播来利用这些知识。

When threatened by the Vatican or other enemies, SEELE responded in kind – by employing assassins to bring down opponents without remorse, and at the same time use their influence and inside men to shape or misshape the policies of the Church, nobles, and other powerful entities. From there, SEELE slowly progressed as it expanded, encroaching its power over Europe, unencumbered by changes in dynasties, kingdoms, empires and wars, as it made itself the secret power behind every throne.  
当受到梵蒂冈或其他敌人的威胁时，SEELE 以同样的方式回应——雇佣刺客无情地击倒对手，同时利用其影响力和内线来塑造或扭曲教会、贵族及其他强大实体的政策。由此，SEELE 逐渐发展壮大，其势力在欧洲蔓延，不受朝代更迭、王国兴衰和战争的影响，成为每个王座背后的秘密力量。

By the late 19th century, interest in the occult was high, especially in Europe, and many influential people sought to acquire occult and mystic knowledge. But only certain personages decided that some of that knowledge be put to use, believing that it could advance mankind in different ways. Among them was Keel Lorenz's grandfather, an enormously prominent German industrialist identified with SEELE, and a fierce believer in the Kabala.  
到了 19 世纪末，人们对神秘学的兴趣高涨，尤其是在欧洲，许多有影响力的人士寻求获得神秘学和秘传知识。但只有某些人物决定将其中一些知识付诸实践，他们相信这能以不同方式推动人类进步。其中就有基尔·洛伦兹的祖父，一位与 SEELE 关系密切的德国著名工业家，也是卡巴拉教义的狂热信徒。

It was claimed in some quarters that World War I, and before that the farcical number of military treaties, was a result of manipulation by SEELE, for the arms industry to maximize their profits: their first application of war as a means to benefit the members' business concerns.  
有观点认为，第一次世界大战及其之前的众多荒谬军事条约，是 SEELE 操纵的结果，旨在使军火工业最大化其利润：这是他们首次将战争作为手段，以惠及成员的商业利益。

Later, the rise of Nazi Germany and Hitler's sudden interest in the occult after reading few quatrains of Nostradamus had Keel's father involved. The senior Lorenz sought to use Hitler's influence and enormous monetary and military clout to study other military applications of occult knowledge, such as telepathy for assassination and communication, but the dictator was greatly absorbed in attempting world domination using conventional warfare. Eventually the senior Lorenz committed suicide after Hitler's defeat, frustrated at that dictator's unwillingness to utilize occult knowledge, leaving young Keel to fend for himself, fighting the Soviets as Berlin slowly succumbed to the invaders.  
后来，纳粹德国的崛起和希特勒在阅读了诺斯特拉达姆斯的几首四行诗后对神秘学的突然兴趣，使得基尔的父亲卷入其中。老伦岑试图利用希特勒的影响力以及庞大的财力和军事力量，研究神秘学在军事上的其他应用，如用于暗杀和通讯的心灵感应，但这位独裁者却沉迷于通过常规战争尝试征服世界。最终，在希特勒战败后，老伦岑因这位独裁者不愿利用神秘学而感到绝望，选择了自杀，留下年轻的基尔独自一人，在柏林逐渐沦陷于入侵者之手时与苏联人作战。

Even as a prisoner of war, and suffered an injury, Keel remained steadfast in his beliefs until somehow an official ordered him released, went over to the American side as a refugee, and from there he began to live a second life in Massachusetts, where he quietly rebuilt SEELE with the remaining membership, and in the process obtained the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls.  
即便身为战俘并遭受伤害，基尔依然坚定不移地坚守自己的信念，直到某位官员下令释放他，他逃至美国成为难民，从此在马萨诸塞州开始了他的第二人生。在那里，他悄然重建了 SEELE，并在此过程中获得了秘密的《死海古卷》。

Keel later returned to Germany with the secret texts, took over a pharmaceutical company, and using the Scrolls as a basis, laid out the framework for the Human Instrumentality Project as he and his followers carefully reconsolidated SEELE's supreme power over the world. Decades later SEELE, in accordance to their prophecy, would create the Artificial Evolution Laboratory, a cover name for Gehirn, followed on later by the establishment of NERV.  
基尔随后带着这些秘密文献返回德国，接管了一家制药公司，并依据《古卷》构建了人类补完计划的框架。他与其追随者们小心翼翼地重新巩固了 SEELE 对世界的至高权力。几十年后，根据 SEELE 的预言，他们创建了人工进化实验室，即 Gehirn 的掩护名称，随后又成立了 NERV。

"_Now that I've told you all about them,"_ Kaji said onscreen, as he was finished giving the history lecture and set aside the SEELE dossier on the counter behind him, _"if you're still sticking around, Shinji, then it's high time to say that I have found many things about your parents."_  
“现在我已经把他们的历史都告诉你了，”屏幕上的加持说道，他结束了历史讲座，将 SEELE 的档案放在身后的柜台上，“如果你还留在这里，真嗣，那么是时候告诉你了，关于你的父母，我已经发现了很多事情。”

Shinji now leaned closer to the laptop screen, and willed himself to listen.  
真嗣现在更靠近笔记本电脑屏幕，努力让自己集中注意力。

From whatever records Kaji was able to weasel out of government archives, especially the Ministry of Education, the University of Kyoto, and the National Police, further enhanced by several interviews (using his own false identity as a journalist / researcher / credit investigator) with some people who once either their neighbors, or studied or worked with him, Gendo Rokobungi was a son of a typical salaryman and a typical housewife; the stereotypical depiction of a Japanese family, circa 1980s.  
根据加持从政府档案中挖出的资料，特别是来自文部省、京都大学和国家警察的记录，再加上他以记者/研究员/信用调查员假身份对一些曾与六分仪源度为邻或共事过的人进行的多次采访，源度是一个典型的工薪阶层和典型家庭主妇的儿子；这是上世纪 80 年代日本家庭的典型形象。

Yet Gendo's life was anything but typical, as their neighbors attested that they really had a dysfunctional existence: husband goes home drunk, wife yells at him, followed by domestic violence… and Gendo didn't seem to mind at all, as he left home in time for school, and returned late at night, probably a session at a cram study center.  
然而，源度的生活绝非寻常，据邻居们证实，他们家确实存在功能障碍：丈夫醉酒回家，妻子对他大吼大叫，随后便是家庭暴力……而源度似乎毫不在意，他按时离家上学，深夜才归，可能是去了补习班。

Gendo's former classmates, from primary school to junior high to high school to college, now grown folks, admitted that he was a complete contradiction: on one hand he was so damned smart, sailing through examinations in minutes as if it was no more than a quiz, that Gendo should be eligible for any scholarship to a big-name university; but his character and personality was disagreeable, if not provokingly hostile, and the same ex-classmates said that Gendo frequently got into fistfights, and he won some and lost others.  
碇源堂从小学到初中再到高中直至大学的昔日同窗，如今都已是成年人，他们承认他是一个彻头彻尾的矛盾体：一方面他聪明绝顶，考试时几分钟就能轻松搞定，仿佛只是个小测验，碇源堂完全有资格获得任何名牌大学的奖学金；但他的性格和个性却令人不快，甚至有时带有挑衅性的敌意，这些老同学还说，碇源堂经常卷入斗殴，有胜有负。

Kaji paused for a while, to grab and open another can of coffee, before he shook out a stick from his pack of red-and-white Marlboros and lit. He took a drag, producing a cloud of nicotine-and-tobacco smoke that wreathed him around momentarily before he resumed talking.  
加持停顿了一会儿，抓起并打开另一罐咖啡，然后从他的红白万宝路烟盒中抖出一根烟点燃。他吸了一口，吐出一团尼古丁和烟草的烟雾，暂时环绕在他周围，然后他继续说话。

For some odd reason, his interviewees said, some girls gravitated to Gendo, despite his contradictory behavior, and later the same girls walked away crying and brokenhearted, apparently unable to fulfill what he wanted in the opposite sex.  
出于某种奇怪的原因，他的受访者说，尽管碇源堂的行为矛盾重重，但有些女孩还是被他吸引，后来这些女孩却伤心欲绝地离开，显然无法满足他在异性方面的需求。

Those who studied with Gendo at Kyoto said that he was a fastidious bioengineering student by day, and a bad-ass street brawler at night, and often after a barroom fight Gendo was to be found spending the night in the local police station, before being released on bail from an unknown beneficiary. One graduate, a doctor now, commented sourly that Gendo was a total sonofabitch, seemed to have this single-minded drive of a shark, to do anything to be on top of his field; other classmates said that it took guts to study alongside with Gendo, for his attitude and intellect seemed to scare and intimidate them, and by extension, terrorized his professors. Perhaps, Kaji asserted, Gendo was determined to bury the past completely by studying intensively, and his brilliance went unnoticed by some influential people they don't know of, which explained for Gendo's regular patronization of the jail cell without even a formal criminal case filed against him.  
那些与源渡在京都大学同窗的人说，他白天是个一丝不苟的生物工程学生，夜晚则化身为街头狠角色，酒吧斗殴后常在当地的警察局过夜，随后由一位不知名的恩人保释出来。一位如今已是医生的校友酸溜溜地评论道，源渡是个彻头彻尾的混蛋，仿佛拥有鲨鱼般一心向上的驱动力，为了站在领域顶端无所不用其极；其他同学则表示，与源渡同窗需要勇气，他的态度和才智似乎吓到了他们，进而也震慑了教授们。或许，加持断言，源渡决心通过刻苦学习彻底埋葬过去，而他的才华未被某些他们不知晓的有影响力人士注意到，这解释了为何源渡频繁光顾牢房却从未有正式的刑事案件记录。

Anyway, of all things that Gendo's ex-classmates noted, the biggest shock to come upon them was when he started dating Yui Ikari, who was then the top genetic engineering student in campus. They also wondered why a woman that beautiful and smart would go out with a man known to use either his head or fists, only later they found out that Gendo became a different man – he turned real soft and madly in love – whenever he was with Yui Ikari.  
无论如何，在碇源堂的同班同学所注意到的所有事情中，最让他们震惊的是他开始与碇唯交往，当时她是校园里顶尖的遗传工程学学生。他们也纳闷，一个如此美丽聪明的女人怎么会和一个以头脑或拳头解决问题的人在一起，直到后来他们才发现，每当碇源堂与碇唯在一起时，他就变成了一个完全不同的人——他变得温柔且疯狂地爱着她。

The last time they heard of Gendo was when after he received his diploma on graduation day, a representative from some pharmaceutical company hired him on the spot, and that was it. Kaji filled that void with his own snooping work, however, that Gendo became an high-ranking employee for the Japanese branch of Hegelmann Pharma; officially he was to work in a lab, but in reality he was often called in to work on some unspecified and mysterious projects, one of which was responsible for the cataclysm at Antarctica.  
他们最后一次听说碇源堂的消息是在他毕业那天拿到学位证书后，某制药公司的一位代表当场聘用了他，就这样。加持则通过自己的调查填补了这个空白，得知碇源堂成为了黑格尔曼制药日本分公司的高级雇员；官方上他将在实验室工作，但实际上他经常被召去参与一些未明确且神秘的项目，其中之一导致了南极的灾难。

Kaji went on reciting his dossier on Gendo Ikari, from his involvement with the Adam excavation, to his multiple leading roles in operating the Artificial Evolution Laboratory, which was a cover for Gehirn, and later SEELE promoted him as Commander of NERV. There were, of course, some discrepancies, such as Gendo's annual salary, which was greater than what was paid for the average scientist at a private firm.  
加治继续背诵着关于碇源堂的档案，从他参与亚当挖掘的行动，到他在人工进化实验室（实际上是 Gehirn 的掩护）中担任多个领导角色，再到后来 SEELE 提拔他为 NERV 的指挥官。当然，其中也有一些出入，比如碇源堂的年薪，远高于一般私企科学家的薪酬。

Then Kaji mentioned about the supposed accident which took the life of Yui Ikari, and spoke in detail the copy of an after-incident report on the incident, which even made it into the news, with even some newspaper clippings to prove. The incident and the controversial aftermath that followed, became a catalyst for Gendo to lay out his own proposal: the Human Instrumentality Project.  
接着，加治提到了据称夺走碇唯生命的所谓事故，并详细叙述了一份事故后报告的副本，这份报告甚至登上了新闻，还有报纸剪报为证。这一事件及其引发的有争议的后果，成为碇源堂提出自己计划——人类补完计划的催化剂。

"That made sense," Shinji muttered. "That explains why he's acting like that."  
“这说得通，”真嗣喃喃自语，“这就解释了他为什么那样行事。”

Misato agreed with a nod.  
美里点头表示同意。

At that point, Kaji said that he can now talk about Yui Ikari and her mysterious origins.  
就在那时，加持说他现在可以谈谈碇唯及其神秘的身世了。

To begin with, Yui Ikari, born Yui Saint-Clair, was a daughter of a high-profile and extremely wealthy French tycoon, and a Japanese biologist who was a candidate for the Nobel Prize for her discoveries in genetics. She was, of course, schooled first in France, then to fulfill her mother's wishes, moved to Japan and enrolled at Kyoto University to continue her doctorate studies on bioengineering.  
首先，碇唯，原名圣克莱尔·唯，是一位法国知名且极其富有的企业家的女儿，同时也是一位日本生物学家，因其遗传学领域的发现而成为诺贝尔奖候选人。当然，她最初在法国接受教育，后来为了实现母亲的愿望，移居日本并在京都大学继续攻读生物工程博士学位。

But tragedy struck when Yui's parents died in a mysterious car accident, leaving her an orphan yet her father, who turned out to be a secret affiliate of SEELE, made her eligible for membership, and thus became the youngest within the cabal.  
但悲剧发生在碇唯的父母在一次神秘的车祸中去世，使她成为孤儿，而她的父亲原来是 SEELE 的秘密成员，这使她有资格加入，从而成为该组织中最年轻的成员。

At around the same time Yui first met Gendo Rokobungi just as she was trying to move on with her life, and for some odd reason she gravitated towards the man despite the controversy surrounding his personal conduct, unaware of the fact that Gendo discovered her connections to SEELE, wanting to gain membership and the same privileges she enjoyed within that secret society.  
大约在 Yui 初次遇见 Gendo Rokobungi 的时候，她正试图继续自己的生活，出于某种奇怪的原因，尽管围绕他的个人行为存在争议，她还是被这个男人所吸引，却未意识到 Gendo 已经发现了她与 SEELE 的联系，渴望获得会员资格并享受她在那个秘密社会中所拥有的同样特权。

From whatever scant records that Kaji could find, according to one written account of a SEELE member, Yui was a very outspoken character at meetings, often finding herself locking horns with Chairman Keel Lorenz on the issue of humanity's destiny and how they interpreted the Scrolls, arguing that humanity still has a chance at salvation without having to resort to devolution or destruction. The same member said that with her arguments and reasons contrary to the views of the Chairman, Yui was marked for 'erasure', SEELE's euphemism for assassination.  
根据 Kaji 能找到的零星记录，据一位 SEELE 成员的书面记载，Yui 在会议上是一个非常直言不讳的人物，经常与主席 Keel Lorenz 就人类命运及其对卷轴的解读发生争执，她认为人类仍有获救的机会，无需诉诸退化或毁灭。这位成员还提到，由于她的论点和理由与主席的观点相左，Yui 被标记为‘抹除’，这是 SEELE 对暗杀的委婉说法。

Perhaps, Kaji figured, this might explain why Yui made the fateful decision to become the guinea pig for the contact experiment with Unit-01, to save the project she was working on, and also perhaps why the Commander was paying much attention to the development of the Evas.  
或许，加持认为，这可以解释为什么唯会做出那个致命的决定，成为与零一单元接触实验的试验品，以拯救她正在参与的项目，同时也可能解释了司令为何如此关注 EVA 的开发。

"…_and, oh, if Asuka's watching this,"_ Kaji said afterwards, _"perhaps you would like to find out about your mom's involvement into this matter."_  
“……哦，如果明日香在看这个，”加持随后说道，“也许你会想了解你母亲在这件事中的参与情况。”

Now it was Asuka's turn to be surprised.  
现在轮到明日香感到惊讶了。

"_You see, like Shinji's mom, about ten years ago your mother was a test subject for the development of Unit Two; same procedure except they changed some of the test parameters so as not to repeat what happened to Unit One. Unfortunately, although your mom was in one piece physically, according to eyewitness accounts and incident reports, the maternal part of her soul was absorbed by Unit Two, causing catastrophic psychological damage that they were forced to put her into an institution."_  
“你看，就像真嗣的妈妈一样，大约十年前，你的母亲是二号机开发的测试对象；同样的程序，只是他们调整了一些测试参数，以免重蹈一号机的覆辙。不幸的是，尽管你妈妈身体完好无损，但根据目击者证词和事故报告，她母性部分的灵魂被二号机吸收，造成了灾难性的心理伤害，他们不得不将她送进精神病院。”

_Kaji then sighed and added, "I think you already know the rest of the story, whose details I'm not going to bother with. Still, if you want to get closer to the truth, I've included files on your mom – and Shinji's – so that you can read them… and I want you to remember that you have to come to terms with your past."  
加持随后叹了口气，补充道：“我想你已经知道故事的其余部分了，细节我就不赘述了。不过，如果你想更接近真相，我包含了你妈妈和真嗣妈妈的文件，你可以阅读它们……我希望你记住，你必须面对你的过去。”_

Asuka nodded, and she whispered, "I will."  
明日香点点头，轻声说：“我会的。”

"_Once you finally understand what I said back when we were at the ship, I hope this time you'll be able to know that there's more to life than Eva, that as you break the walls around you, you can find real happiness than mere acquisition of knowledge or that tendency of yours to throw that weight around. Always be a good girl, okay? Be yourself."_  
“一旦你最终理解了我当时在船上说的话，我希望这次你能明白，生活不仅仅是 Eva，当你打破周围的壁垒时，你能找到真正的幸福，而不仅仅是知识的积累或你那种喜欢摆架子的倾向。永远做个好女孩，好吗？做你自己。”

Kaji gave her a smile and added, _"If you're with Shinji, I know you two make a very fine couple… It's because I feel he'll mature enough to understand the world around him, and that even if he couldn't say much, I believe that he likes you. Trust me, I hope that both of you would do one notch better than me and Katsuragi, that you'll not repeat the dumb mistakes we made throughout our lives._  
加持对她微微一笑，补充道：“如果你和真嗣在一起，我知道你们俩会是一对很好的伴侣……因为我感觉他会成熟到理解周围的世界，即使他不太会表达，我相信他是喜欢你的。相信我，我希望你们俩能比我跟葛城做得更好，不要重复我们一生中犯的那些愚蠢错误。”

Slowly, Asuka reached out for Shinji's hand and held it.  
慢慢地，明日香伸出手握住了真嗣的手。

"_Katsuragi… I'm sorry if I had to resort to all this cloak-and-dagger stuff, but this is one of the few options left for me to hand you over the truth. Don't get mad, just do the right thing even as I'm about to face the consequences of my own doing… and don't give up either, for I hope you could stop this runaway train before it crashes. It's up to you to change all of this, for the sake of the future._  
"葛城…如果我不得不采取这种秘密行动，我很抱歉，但这是我能将真相交给你的少数选择之一。别生气，即使我即将面对自己行为的后果，也要做正确的事…也不要放弃，因为我希望你能在它失控之前阻止这列脱轨的列车。这一切能否改变，全靠你了，为了未来。

"Thank you," Misato mumbled back.  
"谢谢你，"美里喃喃回应道。

"_But if someone else has this box other than you, and they're watching right now… I hope they'll burn."_  
"但如果这个盒子在别人手里，而他们现在正在看着…我希望他们会毁灭。"

Kaji now smiled wanly and he leaned closer to the camera.  
加治此刻苦笑了一下，他向摄像头凑得更近了些。

"_By the way, if you're wondering about the words that I'm supposed to say after all those years … Forgive me for everything I did, but I love you, Misato… and be careful out there."_  
“顺便一提，如果你想知道这些年我该说的话……请原谅我做的一切，但我爱你，美里……在外面要小心。”

There was silence after the video concluded, as all five of them let the truth sink into their thoughts, pondering, trying to piece all of the factoids together, creating a single coherent picture.  
视频结束后，一片寂静，他们五人都让真相慢慢渗透进思绪，沉思着，试图将所有零散的事实拼凑起来，形成一幅连贯的画面。

"What do you guys think?" Misato asked, breaking the silence as she pinched the bridge of her nose, trying not to cry this time.  
“你们怎么看？”美里打破沉默问道，她捏着鼻梁，努力不让眼泪掉下来。

"I can't say anymore," Shinji replied, but then he shook his head, and anguished, "No, it makes sense. All of it, even if… Oh, my… Mom did all that, thinking it was for the future! But what for? Why it has to be me? No…"  
“我无话可说，”真嗣回答，但随即摇了摇头，痛苦地说，“不，这一切都说得通。所有的一切，即使……哦，天哪……妈妈做了那么多，都是为了未来！但为了什么？为什么非得是我？不……”

Shinji then felt dizzy, cradling his face upon hands, the sheer weight of the facts had finally hit him hard. His parents… They were both indeed involved into this grand scheme, but he wasn't sure how far they have gone to, playing a game with a powerful man he, for the first time, saw who he was, what he did to the world, and was ultimately responsible for the creation of the organization that he was supposed to fight on their behalf.  
真嗣随后感到一阵眩晕，双手捧着脸，事实的重压终于狠狠击中了他。他的父母……他们都确实卷入了这个宏大的计划，但他不确定他们究竟走到了哪一步，与一个他第一次看清其真面目、所作所为以及最终为创建这个他本应为之战斗的组织负责的强大男人玩着一场游戏。

He looked up and gazed at his companions, who were watching him. They all looked concerned, and he remembered Asuka telling him perhaps twice that he was in the spotlight, center stage, the lone cello player who must entertain the audience, out to judge his performance.  
他抬起头，凝视着他的同伴们，他们正注视着他。每个人都显得忧心忡忡，他记起明日香曾两次告诉他，他正处于聚光灯下，舞台中央，那个必须取悦观众的独奏大提琴手，所有人都准备评判他的表现。

_What audience?_ Shinji asked himself, and it dawned upon him that he was the one Eva pilot who commandeered the deadliest weapon ever built, which was supposedly meant to make war on behalf of humanity.  
什么观众？真嗣自问，随即恍然大悟，他是唯一一个操控着史上最致命武器的 EVA 驾驶员，这武器本应代表人类进行战争。

Humanity, he realized, was his audience, and all of it was hinged upon the decisions he made.  
他意识到，人类就是他的观众，一切成败都系于他所做的决定。

Now if he performed badly for the last time before this audience, there may be no future for him and everyone else… But if he could do it right once more, and succeeded, perhaps when all this was over he could have the peace and normalcy he longed for; he wanted to live like every other 14-year-old kid, wishing to savor a life that did not involve the smell of burning flesh, spilt blood, and powdered concrete, or to hear orders over the comlink, telling him to take down the Angel with all means necessary.  
如今，如果他在最后一次面对观众时表现糟糕，那么他和所有人可能都没有未来了……但如果他能再做对一次，并取得成功，也许这一切结束后，他就能拥有他渴望的平静和正常生活；他想要像其他 14 岁的孩子一样生活，希望品味一种不涉及烧焦的肉体、洒落的鲜血和粉末状混凝土的生活，也不想听到通讯器里的命令，告诉他必须不惜一切手段击倒那个天使。

But, no, there was no escaping, no place to run away from, as he did twice before, and destiny had put him into the cockpit seat. Apart from his fate, until then this war was not yet over, and there would be more pain and suffering to endure before they all could have their peace.  
但是，不，无处可逃，无处可逃，就像他之前两次那样，命运已经让他坐进了驾驶舱。除了他的命运，直到那时这场战争还未结束，在他们都能获得和平之前，还有更多的痛苦和苦难需要忍受。

Shinji sighed, and he said, "There's no way for me."  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“我无路可走。”

Misato blinked. "What are you talking about? Are you all right?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“你在说什么？你还好吗？”

"Y… Yeah, I'm okay. I just feel overwhelmed," he admitted, before straightening out. "I realized what or why Mom did all this for me."  
“嗯……我没事。只是感到有些不知所措，”他承认道，随后挺直了身子。“我明白了妈妈为我做这一切的原因。”

"Go on," Kaworu said, trying to encourage him to speak up. It was his first time to say a few words after he watched the video in silence.  
“继续说，”渚薰说道，试图鼓励他开口。这是他看完视频后沉默许久以来第一次说话。

"I think back then she could not do what I'm supposed to do right now. Perhaps she sacrificed herself in the process to make her work succeed; perhaps there are many reasons that I don't know yet…"  
"我想那时候她可能无法完成我现在应该做的事。或许她在过程中牺牲了自己以确保她的工作成功；或许还有许多我不知道的原因……"

"Unfinished business, perhaps?" Kaworu suggested.  
"未竟之事，或许？" 渚薰提议道。"

Shinji nodded. "Maybe… Maybe that's why I feel she's in Unit One, protecting me, just as you've said. So there's not much of a choice for me except to stay, perhaps I was meant to be here because I think Mom needs me to finish what she started, not because Father or that… Whatever that Lorenz man wants."  
真嗣点点头。 "也许……也许这就是为什么我觉得她在初号机里保护我，正如你所说。所以我除了留下来别无选择，也许我注定要在这里，因为我觉得妈妈需要我完成她未竟的事业，不是因为父亲或那个……不管那个洛伦兹先生想要什么。"

"Which is why right now we're making plans to stop your father," Misato said. "They want you Children to pilot those Evas to accomplish their objective, which is the Human Instrumentality Plan."  
"这就是为什么我们现在正在制定计划来阻止你的父亲，"美里说。"他们想要你们这些孩子们驾驶那些 Eva 来实现他们的目标，也就是人类补完计划。"

"What that means?" Shinji asked.  
"那是什么意思？"真嗣问道。"

"Supposedly," Misato said as she shook her head, "the so-called next step for humanity. Yet that plan is _not_ for our benefit, but for those old men, and possibly what your father is going after."  
"据称，"美里摇着头说，"这是人类所谓的下一步。然而那个计划不是为了我们，而是为了那些老头子，可能还有你父亲所追求的东西。"

"Mom, right?"

But Misato wasn't done yet, as she brought out a piece of paper, which was dated months ago and in Kaji's handwriting:  
但 Misato 还没说完，她拿出一张纸，日期是几个月前的，字迹是 Kaji 的：

_Delivered Adam to Ikari, having used the naval convoy for Unit-02 to piggyback on as cover. Not sure what the hell he's going to do with it, but given how important that thing is, I have a feeling he might soon harness its power for whatever he has in mind. Makes me think of_ Frankenstein_. Damn scary._  
已将亚当交给碇，利用二号机的海上护航作为掩护。不清楚他到底打算用那东西做什么，但考虑到其重要性，我有一种预感，他可能很快就会利用它的力量来实现他的计划。这让我想起了《弗兰肯斯坦》。真他妈吓人。

She then passed the note to the Children, who took turns reading, before it was returned into her hands. Misato then said, "As you can see, Shinji, your father is currently in possession of Adam, which is no doubt has a role to play in Instrumentality soon... if we don't stop him."  
她随后将纸条递给孩子们，他们轮流阅读，最后又回到她手中。Misato 接着说：“正如你所见，Shinji，你父亲目前拥有亚当，毫无疑问，这将在不久的补完计划中扮演重要角色……如果我们不阻止他的话。”

"And so we should catch him—"  
“所以我们应该抓住他——”

Misato shook her head. "Impossible. He's still very much in control, and if we act too fast we'll fail. We need to time it right and convince some people before he could exploit Adam for his own end."  
美里摇了摇头。“不可能。他仍然控制得很好，如果我们行动太快就会失败。我们需要把握好时机，并在他利用亚当达到自己的目的之前说服一些人。”

Asuka and Shinji could only manage a frustrated sigh.  
明日香和真嗣只能无奈地叹了口气。

"She's right," Kaworu said. "Let's be patient."  
"她是对的，" 渚薰说。"让我们耐心等待。"

There was silence among them for a moment, until Shinji turned his attention to the Fifth Children and questioned, "What do you say about this?"  
他们之间沉默了一会儿，直到真嗣将注意力转向第五适格者，问道："你怎么看这件事？"

"Me?" Kaworu responded, before he mulled over the other boy's question. _I don't know how much Kaji knows about SEELE, or… even about me._  
"我吗？" 渚薰回答，然后沉思着对方的提问。"我不知道加持对 Seele 了解多少，或者……甚至对我了解多少。"

He looked back at the other couple, watching him. _Yet what if they find out? How they'll react?_  
他回头看向另一对情侣，他们正注视着他。但如果他们发现了真相呢？他们会作何反应？

Kaworu remembered about him and Shinji talking about betrayal. He was now worried about Shinji going sour on him, if ever the masquerade he carefully constructed around him, and the friendship he forged between him and that boy was shattered by any of Kaji's revelations. Therefore, he must come up with a plan in case that happens.  
渚薰想起了他和真嗣谈论背叛的情景。他现在担心的是，如果他精心构建的伪装和与那个男孩之间的友谊被加持的任何揭露所摧毁，真嗣会对他产生反感。因此，他必须想出一个计划，以防这种情况发生。

_I can still explain to them, even if they could get angry. After all, nothing really bad happened when I admitted to Rei and Misato about myself. I can also tell that it's no longer my business to follow whatever Keel tells me to do; what I care about is making Shinji happy.  
我仍然可以向他们解释，即使他们可能会生气。毕竟，当我向绫波和美里坦白自己的时候，并没有发生什么坏事。我也可以告诉他们，不再听从基尔的任何指示已经与我无关；我所关心的是让真嗣幸福。_

_It's been… what? Five days, six… and… Goodness, I wish I could make this friendship last longer. I wish it was never my destiny to subjugate.  
已经……多少天了？五天，还是六天……而且……天哪，我真希望这份友谊能持续得更久一些。我真希望自己从未注定要征服。_

The Fifth Children sighed, and he said, "It'll be our task soon to avert this nightmare, in anyway we could. Mankind has enough of tribulation, of fear, doubt and uncertainty, and what kind of future Lorenz will give us?"  
第五适格者叹了口气，说道：“很快就会轮到我们想办法阻止这场噩梦了，无论如何都要尽力。人类已经受够了苦难、恐惧、怀疑和不确定性，洛伦兹会给我们带来什么样的未来呢？”

At the mention of his master's name, Kaworu pondered about the vow he made to betray the very man who raised him, after realizing what humanity truly needed and deserved.  
提到他主人的名字时，渚薰思考着他曾发誓要背叛那个养育他的人，在意识到人类真正需要和应得的东西之后。

"After all of what Kaji has told us, it is not the destiny of mankind to be rewarded extinction." _And the Lilin will always seek repentance for their errors, especially for the opening of Pandora's Box that is the Second Impact, and other transgressions,_ he added_,_ and stared at Shinji.  
"“毕竟加治已经告诉我们了，人类并非注定要走向灭亡。”他补充道，“莉莉丝人将永远寻求对自己错误的忏悔，尤其是引发第二次冲击这一潘多拉魔盒的开启，以及其他越轨行为。”他盯着真嗣说道。

"My brother, I understand that you wanted a normal life, isn't it?"  
“我的兄弟，我明白你渴望过上正常的生活，不是吗？”

The other women blinked at the mere mention of the word _brother._  
其他女性在仅仅提到“兄弟”这个词时都眨了眨眼。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah… I've been waiting."  
真嗣点点头。“嗯……我一直在等。”

"If you want to get to it, we still have a crucible to go through," Kaworu said.  
“如果你想继续，我们还有一段艰难的路要走，”渚薰说。

The other boy shrugged. "I know… But it's not over yet, because we don't know when the next Angel could strike."  
另一个男孩耸耸肩。“我知道……但还没结束，因为我们不知道下一个使徒何时会来袭。”

_So he's still waiting for me,_ Kaworu thought sadly, before an idea came up. Time to change the subject, and besides, why the need to put Shinji through yet another lecture as to why he needs to be the hero of his life's play in the stage of the world?  
所以他还在等我，Kaworu 悲伤地想着，随即一个念头闪现。是时候换个话题了，再说，为什么非要让 Shinji 再经历一次关于他为何需要成为自己人生舞台上的英雄的说教呢？

"Say, aren't you interested in seeing what your mother really looks like?" Kaworu suggested.  
“嘿，你不想看看你母亲真正的样子吗？”Kaworu 提议道。

Shinji suddenly brightened up. "Oh, of course!" he exclaimed.  
Shinji 突然眼前一亮。“哦，当然想！”他兴奋地喊道。

As if on cue, Misato's hands flew to the laptop's keyboard and opened the window to the SD card.  
仿佛是按了开关，美里双手迅速移向笔记本键盘，打开了 SD 卡的窗口。

There was a folder in the card that was named _Ikari Yui_, and Misato opened it to see an array of files inside. She then double-clicked on a picture, and it showed a woman, brown-haired, wearing a lab coat over a pink blouse and a navy-blue skirt. She looked calm and collected, serenely smiling at the camera as though she was a notch better than the _Mona Lisa._  
卡片里有一个名为碇唯的文件夹，美里打开它，里面是一系列文件。她双击了一张图片，画面显示一位棕色头发的女性，身着粉色衬衫和深蓝色裙子，外面套着一件实验室外套。她看起来平静而从容，对着镜头微笑，仿佛比蒙娜丽莎还要高出一筹。

Shinji blinked. He couldn't believe that this was how...  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他无法相信这就是...

He glanced at his mom's picture onscreen, and back to Rei, who was sitting silently but looking at the visage, and eyes darting back again. Shinji was now making rapid facial comparisons between Rei and his mom… and although with a complete difference in age, hair and eye color, and perhaps even their personalities, there was an uncanny resemblance between the two women.  
他瞥了一眼屏幕上母亲的画像，又转向沉默地坐着但凝视着那画像的丽，目光来回闪动。真嗣现在正快速地在丽和母亲之间进行着面部比较……尽管年龄、发色、眼色，甚至可能是性格上都有天壤之别，但这两位女性之间却有着一种诡异的相似之处。

_Mom…? Ayanami…? They look almost the… same?  
妈妈……？绫波……？她们看起来几乎……一模一样？_

Shinji looked up to Asuka, and her face registered utter amazement, as if telling him, mouthing the words silently, _Is the Wondergirl… Your twin sister?_  
真嗣抬头看向明日香，她的脸上写满了惊愕，仿佛在无声地告诉他，用口型说着，难道这个冰山美人……是你的双胞胎姐妹？

The Third Children nodded, for all of his long-standing suspicions about the First Children has finally became truth.  
第三子点了点头，他长期以来对第一子的怀疑终于变成了事实。

---

Rei, on the other hand, was staring back at a face that was eerily familiar, as if looking into a mirror; the woman's brown hair was shaped almost like hers, a facial expression that was gentle and serene, and the eyes seem to possess intelligence…  
另一方面，丽正凝视着一张异常熟悉的面孔，仿佛在照镜子；女人的棕色头发几乎与她的相似，面部表情温柔宁静，眼睛似乎蕴含着智慧……

_Who are you?_ Rei asked silently, her heart was pounding and within her head, something was cut loose from the murky depths, information long dormant and unconscious, and they all came instantly in a flood:  
你是谁？丽默默地问，她的心跳加速，在她脑海中，有什么东西从混沌的深处被释放出来，那些长期沉睡且无意识的信息，瞬间如洪水般涌来：

"_I'm also thinking about making a home… I mean, if I could meet a nice person."  
"我也在考虑建立一个家……我是说，如果我能遇到一个好人。"  
"Oh, Professor, he's such a cute man… it's just that no one knows it."  
"哦，教授，他真是个可爱的人……只是没人知道这一点。"  
"SEELE and Gehirn, the organizations for preventing the final tragedy."  
"SEELE 和 Gehirn，这两个组织旨在防止最终悲剧的发生。"  
"All things happen as they must. That is why I'm with SEELE for Shinji's sake..."  
"一切皆有其必然，这便是我为何为真嗣的缘故而加入 SEELE……"  
"That's why. I want to show my child the bright future."  
"正因为如此。我想向我的孩子展示光明的未来。"_

And as her mind began to spin, nausea taking over, images from the past flashed before her imagination's eyes:  
随着她的思绪开始旋转，恶心感袭来，过去的影像在她想象的眼中闪现：

_Yui and Gendo, in an embrace as they kissed and danced right on the bed.  
Yui 和 Gendo 相拥而吻，在床上翩翩起舞。  
Yui breastfeeding Shinji in her arms.  
Yui 怀抱着 Shinji 哺乳。  
Yui walking with Shinji in tow, as they came through the gates of a kindergarten school.  
Yui 牵着 Shinji 的手，穿过幼儿园的大门。  
Yui clad in what appeared to be a prototype of a plug suit, and sitting right in an entry plug.  
优衣身着看似是插头服原型的服装，正坐在驾驶舱内。_

Finally, one memory leaped out from this train of images:  
终于，一段记忆从这连串的影像中跃然而出：

"_Have you decided on a name?" Gendo asked, as he and Yui were standing by the railing of the balcony of their apartment, in a city somewhere._  
“你决定好名字了吗？”源堂问道，他和优衣正站在某座城市的公寓阳台栏杆旁。

_Consciously Yui stroked the roundness of her abdomen, as though she was assuring the unborn within her womb of a destiny that would come, and she answered, "If it's a boy, Shinji…"  
有意识地，Yui 抚摸着她腹部的圆润，仿佛在向她子宫内未出生的孩子保证即将到来的命运，她回答道：“如果是男孩，就叫 Shinji…”_

"_If it's a girl… then Rei."_  
“如果是女孩…那就叫 Rei。”

One moment, Rei was silent, but in the next her eyelids began to flutter, and then eyes rolled upwards, as if she was about to faint. She wanted to speak, but nothing came out of her mouth except for a low moan.  
前一刻，Rei 还沉默着，但下一刻她的眼睑开始颤动，接着眼睛向上翻转，似乎她快要晕倒了。她想说话，但除了低沉的呻吟声，什么也没从她嘴里出来。

"Rei?" Kaworu asked, as he was the first to notice the girl's strange behavior.  
“丽？”渚薰第一个注意到女孩的异常行为，问道。

"Ayanami, what's wrong…?" Shinji whispered, with Asuka and Misato visibly surprised, before Rei slammed back-first onto the tatami mat, and she lost consciousness right there.  
“绫波，怎么了……？”真嗣低声问道，而明日香和美里则明显感到惊讶，随后绫波猛地向后倒在榻榻米上，当场失去了意识。

---

In her lab and with a cigarette in hand, Ritsuko was still analyzing the sync data coming from Asuka and Unit-02, displayed on her computer monitor, trying to figure out how that girl managed to regain all that she lost in the last few weeks, when the phone on her desk rang loud, completely disrupting her train of thought.  
在她的实验室里，手里夹着一支烟，律子仍在分析从明日香和二号机传来的同步数据，这些数据显示在她的电脑屏幕上，试图弄清楚那个女孩是如何在最近几周内重新找回她失去的一切，这时桌上的电话突然响了起来，完全打断了她的思绪。

Immediately she crushed the cigarette into the ashtray, grabbed the phone and said, "Yes, this is Doctor Akagi speaking, may I—"  
她立刻将香烟碾灭在烟灰缸里，抓起电话说道：“是的，我是赤木律子医生，请问——”

"Ritsuko!" Misato answered back, cutting the doctor off. "I need you, Natsumi and some paramedics to come down here… We have a problem with Rei."  
“律子！”美里回应道，打断了医生的话。“我需要你、夏美和一些急救人员过来……我们有关于绫波的问题。”

That really brought Ritsuko standing on her feet, and her hand almost collided with her half-full mug of coffee. "What?" she exclaimed.  
这番话让律子猛地站起身来，她的手差点撞翻了那杯半满的咖啡。“什么？”她惊呼道。

"I don't know, but she blacked out."  
"我不知道，但她昏过去了。"

"And what the heck she's doing there with you?"  
"她和你在一起到底在搞什么鬼？"

"We were watching Kaji's last confession."  
"我们在看 Kaji 的最后一次告白。"

Ritsuko blinked. "You mean…?"  
律子眨了眨眼。“你是说…？”

"Yeah, Kaji was spilling all the beans for our benefit; he left us a gift."  
“是啊，加持把一切都告诉我们了；他给我们留下了一份礼物。”

"Okay, we're coming," Ritsuko replied, cut off Misato, then made a call to the Infirmary for paramedics, before placing the receiver back to the cradle and rushed out of the lab.  
“好的，我们这就来，”律子回答道，打断了美里，然后给医务室打电话叫救护车，再把听筒放回原位，急匆匆地冲出了实验室。

**Author's Notes:** I'm sorry if it was so long in coming to return, as in my absence, real-life issues and a serious writer's block have almost stopped me from picking up the fic again; took much to fight off distractions and whatnot in the weeks after the last but…  
作者的话：若此文姗姗来迟，令您久候，我深感抱歉。在我缺席期间，现实生活的种种问题与严重的写作障碍几乎让我无法再次拾起这篇同人；在上一章之后的几周里，我费了很大力气才摆脱了各种干扰……

Welcome to the Third Season of Light and Water, and this probably is the longest (and possibly the hard-hitting or insane, call it what you want) chapter I produced, perhaps to make up for lost time. It also took me time to come up with this chapter, thinking of what happens next, and it's never easy. IMHO, it's hard to write when I get tired after a long day of housework, and I'm not kidding.  
欢迎来到《光与水》的第三季，这可能是我迄今为止最长（也可能是最震撼或疯狂的，随你怎么称呼）chapter作品，或许是为了弥补失去的时间。构思这个chapter也花了我不少时间，思考接下来会发生什么，这从来都不容易。在我看来，经过一天繁重的家务后疲惫不堪时写作确实很难，我可不是在开玩笑。

To my readers, I'll try to keep on writing, and whatever comments or criticisms you have, I'm still open… and by the way, expect more of the unexpected.  
对于我的读者们，我会努力继续写作，无论你们有什么评论或批评，我都乐于接受……顺便说一句，敬请期待更多意想不到的情节。

Belated Merry Christmas and an advanced Happy New Year.  
迟来的圣诞快乐和提前的新年快乐。

### Chapter 32 REIncarnation  
Chapter 32 转世

_Naked and almost dazed, Rei was floating in this imaginary ocean, just like before, as bubbles swirled around and over her head. The vast blue of this unknown ocean of the subconscious had enveloped her, and once more she didn't know how she came here.  
赤裸且近乎茫然，丽正漂浮在这虚幻的海洋中，一如往昔，气泡在她周围和头顶盘旋。这片广阔无垠的潜意识之海已将她包裹，她再次不知自己是如何来到这里的。_

_The last image she saw before was staring at the face of a woman who she had never seen in her entire life, and then asked, Who are you?  
她最后看到的画面是一个女人，一个她一生中从未见过的面孔，然后问道：“你是谁？”_

_The question somehow unlocked a thousand secrets laid hidden in her subconscious. How they came to exist, she didn't understand.  
这个问题不知怎的解开了她潜意识中隐藏的千重秘密。它们是如何存在的，她并不明白。_

Who is this? 这是谁？  
Who am I?  
What am I?  
What am I?  
What am I?  
What am I?

_Those questions that have sometimes pricked her consciousness, as Rei tried to reassert her own identity.  
那些有时会刺痛她意识的疑问，正如丽试图重新确立自己的身份。_

_Sure, Kaworu already told her that she possessed the soul of Lilith within, yet Rei didn't realize, until now, she was an entirely different person, with a distinct memory.  
当然，渚薰已经告诉过她，她体内拥有莉莉丝的灵魂，但丽直到现在才意识到，她是一个完全不同的人，拥有独特的记忆。_

_Names flashed before her eyes, then faces, places, dates, facts and figures… For a brief moment she saw herself standing, and dressed once again in her school uniform, before the façade of a large stone church… No, a monumentally-huge cathedral towering over, decorated with weathered statues, gargoyles, stained glass windows, and it was flanked by a pair of equally big bell towers.  
名字在她眼前闪过，接着是面孔、地点、日期、事实和数字……有那么一瞬间，她看到自己站在那里，再次穿着校服，面对着一座巨大的石制教堂的正面……不，是一座宏伟的哥特式大教堂，高耸入云，装饰着风化的雕像、滴水兽、彩色玻璃窗，两侧还有一对同样巨大的钟楼。_

_Rei turned around and gazed at what looked like a tower in the horizon, and it reminded her of a similar structure she saw in a history book, but it didn't look like the Tokyo Tower, once a prominent landmark before that metropolis was destroyed, first by a tsunami, and then completely obliterated in a nuclear attack, before sinking slowly into the contaminated mud along with the buildings that surrounded it, forever lost and out of reach.  
丽转过身，凝视着地平线上看似一座塔的轮廓，这让她想起了在历史书中见过的类似建筑，但它并不像东京塔，那个曾经的地标性建筑在那个大都市被摧毁之前，先是遭受了海啸的侵袭，随后在核攻击中彻底毁灭，最终与周围的建筑一起缓缓沉入受污染的泥沼中，永远消失，无法触及。_

_No, this tower was grey and brown steel, painted with primer, not the red and white paint scheme that characterized the steel skeleton of the Tokyo Tower for decades.  
不，这座塔是灰褐色的钢结构，涂着底漆，并非东京塔那标志性的红白相间的涂装，这种涂装曾为其钢骨架增添了数十年的特色。_

_What is this tower, then?  
那么，这座塔又是什么呢？_

_Furthermore, the buildings, built out of brownstone and red tiles, all look strange and beautiful to her, not like the little houses of Tokyo-3 that had tiled roofs and wooden walls.  
此外，那些由褐色石材和红色瓦片建造的建筑物，在她看来既陌生又美丽，与东京-3 那些拥有瓦片屋顶和木质墙体的小房子截然不同。_

_Then, where was she? What city? This was no place in Japan… It could be anywhere.  
那么，她在哪里？哪座城市？这里显然不是日本的地方……它可能位于任何地方。_

_Rei wandered her eyes around the seemingly quiet and serene surroundings, trying to guess her exact location. Just opposite the cathedral was a wide river, with bluish-green water glistening in the sunlight, before an elongated boat of some sort cut through the water, making waves and eddies as its engines throbbed almost quietly. There was also the distant sound of a horn or two, before a chain of barges passed by, pulled by a tugboat upstream, followed by the distinctive two-tone siren of an emergency vehicle somewhere, probably a police car or an ambulance.  
丽环顾四周，试图猜测自己的确切位置。就在大教堂对面，有一条宽阔的河流，碧绿色的水在阳光下闪闪发光，随后一艘细长的船只划破水面，引擎低沉地轰鸣，激起波浪和漩涡。远处还传来一两声汽笛，接着一串驳船被拖船向上游牵引，随后是某个地方紧急车辆的独特双音警报声，很可能是警车或救护车。_

_Yet there was no person in sight; even the vessels in the river were devoid of people and crew.  
然而，眼前空无一人；就连河中的船只也空空如也，不见人影和船员。_

Where am I?

_At the same time the cathedral's bells pealed the time of the day, a flash of light blinded her, and the next thing she knew she was standing on a floor that appeared to be made of clear glass; and below that a framework of steel beams leading downwards to a single nadir, connected to a very small pyramid; the framework also formed a larger inverted pyramid.  
与此同时，教堂的钟声敲响了时刻，一道闪光使她目眩，接下来她发现自己站在一块看似透明玻璃的地板上；下方是一系列通向单一低点的钢梁，连接着一个非常小的金字塔；这些钢梁还构成了一个更大的倒金字塔。_

_She could also see what was beneath the floor, brightly lit and flanked by paintings and other works of art that she could not recognize as art; to her, art was somewhat she only learned at school, but unable to appreciate or understand its significance.  
她还能看到地板下方的景象，灯火通明，两侧陈列着她无法辨识为艺术品的画作和其他艺术作品；对她而言，艺术是她在学校学到的东西，却无法欣赏或理解其重要性。_

_But between her feet was a bronze disk, engraved with the letters 'N' and 'S', signifying north and south, and this disk was directly aligned with the pyramid's apex below her.  
但在她的脚下，是一块青铜圆盘，上面刻着字母‘N’和‘S’，代表南北方向，而这圆盘正与她下方金字塔的顶点直接对齐。_

_Strange, Rei told herself as she slowly gazed up and around, finding three long buildings, made of weathered brownstone and adorned with windows of a grandiose design, flank this vast square of glass and steel; and right before her was yet another glass pyramid, only it was erected right before the façade of the central building, a twin of the inverted pyramid.  
奇怪，丽自言自语道，她缓缓抬头环顾四周，发现三座长长的建筑，由风化的褐色石材建成，装饰着宏伟设计的窗户，环绕着这片广阔的玻璃与钢铁广场；而在她面前，又是一座玻璃金字塔，只是它矗立在中央建筑的正面，与倒置的金字塔形成一对。_

_Both pyramids now reminded her of the distinctive Headquarters pyramid, the focal point of the Geofront, the supposed fortress of NERV, hiding secrets that only a few ever know of.  
这两座金字塔现在让她想起了独特的总部金字塔，那是地表下的焦点，NERV 据称的堡垒，隐藏着只有少数人知晓的秘密。_

_Rei blinked twice in astonishment, wondering if she was still dreaming or was actually transported to this beautiful and haunting location by some untold power. This was too vivid for a dream.  
丽惊讶地眨了两次眼，怀疑自己是否仍在梦中，或是被某种未知的力量带到了这个美丽而令人难忘的地方。这梦境太过逼真。_

"_Rei?"_

_A woman's voice, certainly not that of Doctor Akagi, not of Colonel Katsuragi, not even belonging to Doctor Odani or any of the other older women she came across… this voice calling her name was different, and yet the intonation was a bit familiar, with a hint of warmness, congeniality, and this was a mother's voice.  
一个女人的声音，显然不是赤城博士，也不是葛城上校，甚至不属于小谷博士或她遇到的任何其他年长女性……这个呼唤她名字的声音不同，但语调却有些熟悉，带着一丝温暖和亲切，这是一个母亲的声音。_

_Almost it was like her voice, only more mature, and she was using her first name, as if making it very personal.  
几乎就像她的声音，只是更加成熟，她使用她的名字，仿佛在强调这份亲密。_

_Rei turned around to confront the speaker, and there she was.  
丽转身面对说话者，她就在那里。_

_Not unlike before, when she saw a twisted version of herself in a dream, grinning and leering with unnaturally huge eyes.  
与之前类似，当她在梦中看到一个扭曲的自己，咧嘴笑着，用着异常巨大的眼睛斜视着。_

_Instead, this personage was dressed in a laboratory coat over a purple sweater and a midnight blue skirt, this woman had brown short hair, a gently curved face, dark green eyes that exuded friendliness, and her lips formed in a motherly smile. Most astonishingly, the woman seemed to exuding a bright aura emanating from her silhouette.  
相反，这位女士穿着一件实验室外套，内搭紫色毛衣和深蓝色裙子，她有着棕色的短发，柔和的曲线脸庞，散发着友善的深绿色眼睛，以及母亲般的微笑。最令人惊讶的是，这位女士似乎散发着从她轮廓中发出的明亮光环。_

_For a microsecond, Rei's heart seemed to have stopped in wonderment, before asking with those three words: "Who are you?"  
一瞬间，丽的心仿佛因惊奇而停止了跳动，随即用那三个字问道：“你是谁？”_

_But before she could get a reply, the dream world abruptly changed as a blinding flash of light enveloped her.  
但还没等她得到回答，梦境世界突然发生了变化，一道刺眼的光芒将她包围。_

In the real world, Rei was on a gurney, being pushed by a pair of paramedics as they rushed her to the Infirmary, where Ritsuko and Natsumi were waiting for them at the emergency room.  
在现实世界中，丽正躺在担架上，被两名医护人员推着，急匆匆地送往医务室，那里律子和夏美已经在急诊室等候。

Her companions trailed after, completely worried. Not wanting to miss a chance to show the two doctors their discovery, however, Misato took her laptop with Kaji's SD card still loaded in the slot, and as if that wasn't enough, Shinji snatched the box and carried it with him.  
她的同伴们忧心忡忡地跟在后面。然而，不想错过向两位医生展示他们发现的机会，美里带着装有加持 SD 卡的笔记本电脑，而似乎这还不够，真嗣抢过盒子，一并带着。

By the time they made it before the ER doors, Ritsuko let Misato enter to watch the proceedings and maybe let her friend explain, while the other three Children decided to wait outside at the corridor by sitting on the bench. Meanwhile, Natsumi inwardly noted that Rei was about to set a new record amongst the Children for having the _most visits_ to the Infirmary, putting Shinji in second place.  
当他们赶到急诊室门口时，Ritsuko 让 Misato 先进去观察情况，或许还能让她的朋友解释一下，而其他三位适格者则决定在走廊外的长椅上等待。与此同时，Natsumi 内心暗自注意到，Rei 即将创下适格者中访问医务室次数的新纪录，将 Shinji 挤到了第二位。

Once they loaded Rei onto the table, Ritsuko quickly pulled out a stethoscope, hooked it up to her ears before doing the preliminary checks on the girl's vital signs by unbuttoning her blouse.  
一旦他们将 Rei 安置在床上，Ritsuko 迅速取出听诊器，将其挂上耳朵，然后开始通过解开她的衬衫进行初步的生命体征检查。

"What the hell happened?" Ritsuko asked Misato as she placed the scope on Rei's chest where she could hear the girl's heartbeat and breathing rhythm.  
“到底发生了什么？”Ritsuko 一边问 Misato，一边将听诊器放在 Rei 的胸口，以便听到她的心跳和呼吸节奏。

"Damn, I don't know but she fainted when she saw that picture of Shinji's mom," Misato answered as she placed the laptop onto one of the tables.  
“该死，我不知道，她看到真嗣妈妈的照片时就晕倒了，”美里一边回答，一边将笔记本电脑放在一张桌子上。

Ritsuko was surprised, causing her to pause for a moment. "What?"  
律子感到惊讶，不由得顿了一下。“什么？”

Misato pried open the laptop on the table, spun it around and showed to her the contents of her screen: Yui Ikari's picture.  
美里撬开桌上的笔记本电脑，转过来向她展示屏幕内容：碇唯的照片。

"Hey, that's her," Ritsuko said, recognizing the face. "She supposedly died in a contact experiment several years ago."  
"嘿，那是她，" 律子说道，认出了那张脸。"她据称几年前在一次接触实验中去世了。"

"Who's she?" Natsumi asked while writing down her initial findings on a clipboard.  
"她是谁？" 夏美一边问，一边在剪贴板上记录她的初步发现。"

Ritsuko sighed. "That's Yui Ikari, the Commander's late wife… and Shinji's mom."  
律子叹了口气。"那是碇唯，司令的已故妻子……也是真嗣的妈妈。"

"Oh," Natsumi blurted, before she had a penlight open and pointed its beam onto each of Rei's eyes, open wide with the doctor's fingers, trying to assess the girl's reaction to the light. "Look at this," she said.  
"哦，" 夏美脱口而出，随即打开了一支笔灯，将光束对准了丽的双眼，医生的手指撑开她的眼睑，试图评估她对光线的反应。"看这个，" 她说。

"What?" Misato questioned.  
"什么？" 美里问道。

"No reaction," Natsumi remarked. "She still has rapid eye movement… Seems that she's completely in a trance."  
"没有反应，" 夏美评论道。"她的眼球仍在快速移动……看起来她完全处于恍惚状态。

"Heart rate and breathing normal," Ritsuko reported, before she tried to wake up the girl with a shake to the shoulders. Nothing. Tried tapping Rei's cheeks. No reaction once again. Went back to the eyes, raised the eyelids and found both eyeballs moving jerkily.  
“心率和呼吸正常，”律子报告道，随后尝试摇晃女孩的肩膀以唤醒她。毫无反应。又轻拍零的脸颊，依旧没有反应。她再次检查眼睛，抬起眼睑，发现眼球在急速转动。

Rei was experiencing rapid eye movement or REM, in a complete state of unconsciousness that no external stimuli could budge to wake her up, and at the moment Ritsuko didn't have anything strong enough to snap Rei out and back to the real world.  
零正处于快速眼动睡眠阶段，即 REM，完全无意识状态，任何外界刺激都无法唤醒她。此刻，律子没有任何足够强烈的方法能将零从这种状态中拉回现实世界。

Misato frowned. "Now what?"  
美里皱起眉头。“现在怎么办？”

"I'd better hook her up to an EEG machine, see what's she's going through," Ritsuko said as she walked over to one of the pieces of medical equipment standing around the ER, and pulled the electroencephalograph monitor close to Rei's gurney. "This is no ordinary case of fainting," she added.  
“我最好给她接上脑电图机，看看她经历了什么，”律子说着走向急诊室周围的一台医疗设备，将脑电图监测仪拉近丽的推床旁。“这不是普通的昏迷，”她补充道。

The woman officer nodded. "Okay."  
女警官点了点头。"好的。"

"So, what else have you found?" Ritsuko asked, bringing out a pack of electrodes and then plugged them into the EEG monitor, before nodding to Natsumi to tape the electrodes onto specific spots on Rei's scalp.  
"那么，你还发现了什么？" 赤木律子问道，拿出了一包电极，然后将它们插入脑电图监测仪，向夏美点头示意她将电极贴在绫波零头部的特定位置。

"Well… Kaworu found a box hidden in Kaji's garden and brought it in. When I checked what was inside, it was full of anything that Kaji had collected for God knows how long he dug for secrets."  
"嗯……渚薰在加持的花园里发现了一个隐藏的盒子并带了进来。当我查看里面是什么时，发现里面装满了加持不知收集了多久的各种秘密物品。"

Ritsuko now flipped on the EEG monitor, instantly booting up and the display was alive with brainwave data. "What he's doing out there?" she questioned, referring to Kaworu.  
律子现在打开了脑电图监测仪，仪器立即启动，显示屏上跳动着脑波数据。“他在外面做什么？”她问道，指的是薰。

"That boy? I think that after I told him yesterday that I couldn't water Kaji's plants, he made an errand to do it, and so he brought Rei with him. They were supposed to head off to her flat afterwards, but instead they found that box and hauled it back to me."  
“那个男孩？我想是因为我昨天告诉他我不能给加持的植物浇水，他就特意去做了这件事，还带上了绫波。他们本该之后去她的公寓，但却发现了那个箱子，然后把它搬回来给我。”

"Now where's that box?"  
“那箱子现在在哪儿？”

"It's with Shinji. He's waiting outside. Can't afford to see that go into the wrong hands."  
"在真嗣那里。他在外面等着。不能让那东西落入坏人之手。"

"Ah," Ritsuko mumbled. "Okay, for now let's see what she's up to in dreamland," she added, gesturing at the display, scraggly lines generated by the brain pulses.  
"啊，" 律子咕哝道。"好吧，现在让我们看看她在梦里搞什么鬼，" 她补充道，指着显示屏上由脑电波产生的杂乱线条。

_When Rei opened her eyes again, she was in a different place. She looked around, trying to guess again where she was, and she wondered where the mysterious woman had gone.  
当丽再次睁开眼睛时，她身处一个不同的地方。她环顾四周，试图猜测自己身在何处，同时疑惑那位神秘女子去了哪里。_

_She was standing in the middle of a vast lawn, manicured and verdant grass, and she could see wide pathways leading as far as her eyes can gaze, and at the far end was the same unfamiliar tower rising up to the sky. The sun was up in the sky, and Rei could also feel the breeze.  
她站在一片广阔的草坪中央，修剪整齐、绿意盎然的草地，她能看到宽阔的小径延伸至视线尽头，远处是那座同样陌生的高塔直插云霄。太阳高悬天空，丽也能感受到微风拂面。_

_It was a huge park of some kind, but this time it was filled with people; some were lounging on the lawn and having a picnic, others were sitting on benches, and most of them were walking around. They looked happy, in peace, or for some, engaged in a kiss, as if this park was an intimation of heaven. The air was also filled with laughter, whispers, and a thousand words that she couldn't discern what tongue they were speaking in; all she understood was Japanese, English and (because of her bioengineering books) some German.  
这是一个巨大的公园，但这次里面挤满了人；有的在草坪上野餐，有的坐在长椅上，大多数人则在四处漫步。他们看起来快乐、平和，有些人甚至在亲吻，仿佛这个公园是天堂的预兆。空气中充满了笑声、低语和无数她无法分辨的语言；她只懂日语、英语和（因为她的生物工程书籍）一些德语。_

_And then Rei saw a couple pass by, with a six-year-old girl prancing around. The mother was wearing a blue shirt over a light cotton dress, and she was holding her husband's hand; the father was in a button-up shirt and a pair of beige slacks; and the girl was clad in a light blue shirt and a pair of jeans. Father was Caucasian-looking, the mother seemed to be Japanese in appearance, and so was the girl.  
接着丽看到一对夫妇走过，身边跟着一个蹦蹦跳跳的六岁小女孩。母亲身穿蓝色衬衫，外罩一件轻薄的棉质连衣裙，紧握着丈夫的手；父亲则穿着一件纽扣衬衫和一条米色长裤；而女孩则穿着浅蓝色衬衫和一条牛仔裤。父亲看起来是白种人，母亲似乎是日本人，小女孩也是如此。_

_On closer look at the girl, Rei noted that she had the same hair style as the earlier apparition, yet the girl was also laughing, pointing out landmarks as the family ambled by.  
仔细一看那女孩，丽注意到她的发型与之前的幻影相同，但女孩也在欢笑，指着沿途的地标，一家人悠闲地走过。_

_But what was really striking about the girl was that she looked exactly like Rei's first iteration.  
但真正引人注目的是，女孩的模样与丽的第一代化身如出一辙。_

"_Who are you?" Rei asked again, but they didn't seem to notice her presence as if she was invisible. Instead she could hear them talking, and fortunately for her the family was talking in full-on Japanese._  
"你是谁？" 绫波再次问道，但他们似乎没有注意到她的存在，仿佛她是隐形的。相反，她能听到他们在交谈，幸运的是，这家人说的是日语。

"_Papa," the girl asked, looking anxious. "I feel hungry."_  
"爸爸，" 女孩问道，看起来很焦虑。"我饿了。"

_The father blinked and he stooped down. "What?"  
父亲眨了眨眼，弯下腰。"什么？"_

"_Isn't it almost lunchtime?"_

_He glanced at his watch and said, "Don't worry, my little Yui. We're almost done, and soon enough we'll be eating."  
他瞥了一眼手表，说道：“别担心，我的小 Yui。我们快完成了，很快就能吃东西了。”_

_Rei blinked this time, at the mere mention of the girl's name: Yui.  
这次，Rei 听到女孩的名字 Yui 时眨了眨眼。_

"_Where?" Yui asked._ “哪里？”Yui 问道。

_The father stood up and pointed at the tower. "You know, there's a restaurant right up there at the Eiffel."  
父亲站起身，指向那座塔。“你知道吗，埃菲尔铁塔顶上有一家餐厅。”_

_Yui was suddenly excited. "Really?"  
结衣突然兴奋起来。“真的吗？”_

"_Yes, they do, and from there, while we eat we can see the rest of Paris, completely spread out as far as the eye can see."_  
“是的，确实有，而且从那里，我们一边用餐一边可以俯瞰整个巴黎，尽收眼底。”

_Paris… Rei was now trying to figure out where and when she had last heard of this place and the name sounded vaguely familiar. For all she knew and in her entire life Rei had never ventured far into the outside world, beyond the Geofront and Tokyo-3.  
巴黎…丽现在正努力回想她上次听到这个地方和这个名字是在何时何地，这个名字听起来有些模糊的熟悉。就她所知，在她的一生中，丽从未远离过地底都市和第三新东京市，踏足外面的世界。_

_She remembered that sometimes the Commander would tell her that he would leave for a flight to another side of the world, to meet with people she didn't know or what business they had with NERV.  
她记得有时司令会告诉她，他要飞往世界的另一端，去见一些她不认识的人，或是商讨与 NERV 相关的事务。_

_Rei was watching the family leave her when she thought she heard a couple talking behind her back. She turned around, and suddenly the world changed again, this time Rei was standing in the middle of a classroom.  
当丽看着那家人离开自己时，她觉得自己听到身后有一对夫妇在交谈。她转过身，突然间世界再次改变，这一次，丽站在了一间教室的中央。_

_It had the typical layout of desks, chairs and the whiteboard that was behind the teacher's desk.  
教室里摆着典型的桌椅布局，白板位于讲台后面。_

_Yet this wasn't like the classroom that she came in every morning; this wasn't 2-A, because there were diagrams and posters tacked on, with illustrations of DNA and RNA sequences, organic compounds, and the depiction of the Big Bang.  
然而，这并不是她每天早上进入的那个教室；这不是 2-A 班，因为墙上钉着图表和海报，上面画着 DNA 和 RNA 序列、有机化合物，以及宇宙大爆炸的描绘。_

_Furthermore, the man sitting in the teacher's chair was none other than Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, but he looked younger than he was now; his hair was dark grey, not almost white. His face was also nearly devoid of the age lines that he had today, and at this very moment he was checking papers piled on his desk when, without him expecting he heard the knocking on the door.  
此外，坐在讲台椅子上的人正是副司令官冬月，但他看起来比现在年轻；他的头发是深灰色，而不是几乎全白。他的脸上也几乎没有现在那些岁月的痕迹，此时他正在检查桌上堆放的试卷，突然，在他毫无预料的情况下，听到了敲门声。_

"_Come in," Fuyutsuki said, putting down his pen._  
"请进，" 冬月说道，放下手中的笔。

_The door opened and a woman walked in, carrying a folder in her hands, and this time wearing a white coat over her light floral-patterned dress. It was this Yui again, but older than the kindergartener she saw earlier, and Rei guessed that she was roughly younger than Colonel Katsuragi.  
门开了，一个女人走了进来，手里拿着一个文件夹，这次她穿着一件白色外套，里面是浅色花卉图案的连衣裙。又是这个叫 Yui 的女人，但比之前见到的幼儿园孩子时期的她要年长，丽猜测她大概比葛城上校年轻。_

"_Good morning, Professor," Yui greeted before she bowed._  
"早上好，教授，" Yui 问候道，随即鞠了一躬。

"_Good morning, and I'm Professor Fuyutsuki," Fuyutsuki said, nodding back and smiled as he introduced himself. "What brings you here?" he asked, but then blinked. "Oh, I forgot, someone said that you were looking for me, am I right?"_  
"早上好，我是副教授冬月，" 冬月说道，点头回礼并微笑着自我介绍。"是什么风把你吹来了？" 他问道，随即眨了眨眼。"哦，我忘了，有人说你在找我，对吗？"

"_Yes, sir," Yui said as she walked up to the desk and set the folder on top of it. Fuyutsuki picked it up and read the contents._  
"是的，先生，" 唯说道，她走到桌前，将文件夹放在上面。冬月拿起文件夹，开始阅读里面的内容。

_For a few minutes he skimmed at first, and then he went back to the first page and read closely while Yui watched him, waiting as she sat down on an empty chair. Only after twenty minutes did he said, "Your report is rather unusual, considering that you're only a new student."  
他先是快速浏览了几分钟，然后回到第一页仔细阅读，而唯则在一旁空椅子上坐下，静静等待。直到二十分钟后，他才说道："你的报告相当不寻常，考虑到你只是一名新生。"_

_Yui stood up and nodded. "Thank you very much, sir."  
优站起身，点了点头。"非常感谢您，先生。"_

_Fuyutsuki scratched his head, as though he was trying to guess, and then asked, "Tell me, are you really the daughter of Saeko Ikari, the Nobel Prize nominee?"  
冬月挠了挠头，仿佛在猜测，然后问道："告诉我，你真的是诺贝尔奖提名者碇唯的女儿吗？"_

"_That's right," Yui confirmed._  
"没错，"优确认道。

"_Oh… I see," Fuyutsuki blurted, and then chuckled. "So you are—"_  
"哦…我明白了," 冬月脱口而出，随即轻笑起来。"这么说，你是——"

_Yui sighed, smiled and then she answered, "I'm Yui Ikari Saint-Clair."  
唯叹了口气，微笑着回答道："我是碇唯·圣克莱尔。"_

_Fuyutsuki grinned and nodded approvingly, before he lifted the folder in his hand. "Miss Saint-Clair… er, Miss Ikari, I maybe tempted to ask a few questions, but to be honest, your report is quite stimulating. I mean, only a few students in my class had ever managed to produce something worthwhile as yours, and as far as I'm concerned, you're not even yet enrolled in my course."  
冬月咧嘴一笑，赞许地点了点头，然后举起手中的文件夹。"圣克莱尔小姐…呃，碇小姐，我或许有些问题想问，但老实说，你的报告相当引人入胜。我的意思是，我的班上只有少数学生能写出像你这样有价值的东西，而且据我所知，你甚至还没正式选修我的课程。"_

"_But my course somehow extends to other disciplines, which is why I came here to see if there's any merit in my report."_  
“但我的课程不知怎么地延伸到了其他学科，这就是我来这里看看我的报告是否有价值的原因。”

"_Ah," Fuyutsuki sighed as he glanced at the wall clock. "Say, why don't you join me for lunch and then we talk?" he suggested._  
“啊，”冬月叹了口气，瞥了一眼墙上的时钟。“我说，不如你跟我一起吃午饭，然后我们再谈？”他提议道。

_Yui nodded. "Hm, why not?"  
唯点点头。“嗯，有何不可？”_

---

As though Rei was watching a film, the scene was quickly cut to another scene, this time in a traditional restaurant, almost full of diners, both floors, up and down, packed to the rafters.  
仿佛丽正在观看一部电影，场景迅速切换到另一个画面，这次是在一家传统餐厅，几乎座无虚席，上下两层楼都挤得满满当当。

---

_With their plates emptied, waiting to be picked up by a passing waiter, Fuyutsuki and Yui were talking this time. While eating, Fuyutsuki explained to Yui that he was a friend of the owner, who managed to secure a table for two of them; previously the professor used this table to dine and confer with other academics in his field of interest.  
他们的盘子已经空了，等待着路过的服务员来收走，这次轮到冬月和唯在交谈。用餐时，冬月向唯解释说，他是店主的朋友，因此设法为他们两人预订了一张桌子；以前教授经常用这张桌子与领域内的其他学者共进晚餐并讨论学术问题。_

"_I'm a bit concerned about where you could wind up once you get your doctorate," Fuyutsuki said, changing the subject as he toyed with the swizzle stick of his iced tea. "What are you going to do afterwards? Are you going to apply for a job at some company or a lab?"_  
“我有点担心你拿到博士学位后会去哪里，”冬月说着，一边摆弄着他冰茶里的搅拌棒，转换了话题，“之后你打算做什么？是去某家公司或实验室申请工作吗？”

_Yui shrugged. "I'm still trying to make up my mind, but I may have a third choice to consider."  
优耸了耸肩。“我还在犹豫不决，但我可能还有第三个选择需要考虑。”_

_Fuyutsuki blinked. "Hm?"_

"_I'm still young, sir, but I also wanted to have a bit of stability."_  
“我还很年轻，先生，但我也希望拥有一些稳定。”

"_Like what?"_

_Yui paused for a moment to take a sip of her tea. "I'm thinking of getting married, and only when I meet someone nice," she said.  
优停顿了一下，喝了一口茶。“我在考虑结婚，但前提是我遇到一个合适的人，”她说。_

_Fuyutsuki frowned. "Yet, considering just how advanced your report is, you have a promising career ahead of you."  
冬月皱起眉头。“然而，考虑到你的报告如此先进，你未来的职业生涯可谓前途无量。”_

"_You sound just like my mother," Yui said, sounding as if Fuyutsuki was a prude. "You worry about that?"_  
"你说话的口气简直跟我妈一样，" 优衣说道，仿佛冬月是个老古板。"你担心这个？"

"_No, I'm sorry, but it's just that you're being so talented and then waste it all by getting married. That's what I'm concerned about you. If you graduate, all those companies and labs would be asking for you as if requesting for your hand in marriage; they think you're a gold mine."_  
"不，对不起，只是你这么有才华，却要因为结婚而荒废一切，这才是我担心你的地方。如果你毕业了，那些公司和实验室都会争相邀请你，就像求婚一样；他们觉得你是个金矿。"

"_I don't think whatever I learned for the past six years can be forgotten, and I don't care about the money either. Instead I can try to work, do what I'm better at, and at the same time learn how to raise a child."_  
"我认为过去六年所学的东西不会轻易忘记，我也不在乎钱。相反，我可以尝试工作，做我更擅长的事情，同时学习如何抚养一个孩子。"

"_How can you handle that?" Fuyutsuki asked, sounding incredulous._  
"你怎么能应付得了？" 冬月问道，语气中带着怀疑。"

"_I'm the only child," Yui said. "I apologize but my parents are dead now… They died in a car accident two months ago, so right now I'm staying with my aunt here."_  
"我是独生女，" 唯说，"很抱歉，我的父母已经去世了……他们在两个月前的一场车祸中去世了，所以现在我和这里的阿姨住在一起。"

_This time Fuyutsuki looked morose. "I'm sorry for your loss. I didn't know that."  
这次冬月看起来很忧郁。“对于你的损失，我深感抱歉。我之前并不知情。”_

_Yui sighed. "I'm okay, sir. I can still cope with it, and besides I'm using the trust fund to keep on studying. Anyway, while still young I'm preparing for the inevitability of marriage, so apart from my studies I'm reading up on anything about married life. The last thing I need is to find myself unable to cope with such a life."  
Yui 叹了口气。“我没事的，先生。我还能应付得来，而且我正在用信托基金继续我的学业。无论如何，我还年轻，正在为不可避免的婚姻做准备，所以除了学业之外，我还在阅读有关婚姻生活的所有资料。我最不需要的就是发现自己无法应对这样的生活。”_

"_I see."_

"_So trust me to handle them both; I think I can do it," Yui said reassuringly._  
“所以请相信我能同时处理好这两件事；我认为我可以做到。”Yui 安慰地说道。

_They let a minute or two to pass, to let things sink in.  
他们让时间流逝了一两分钟，让这些话慢慢沉淀。_

"_Well, since you wanted to learn more, why don't you submit your application for my subject?" the older man said._  
"既然你想了解更多，何不提交我的课程申请呢？" 年长者说道。

_Yui nodded. "I'll give you anything you need first thing in the morning, sir. It's a deal."  
优点点头。"我一早就会把您需要的东西交给您，先生。成交。"_

_Fuyutsuki grinned. "Okay. My classes start from eight, and I'll be waiting for you, Miss Ikari."  
冬月咧嘴一笑。“好的。我的课从八点开始，我会等你，碇小姐。”_

"_Uh… Why don't you call me Yui instead?" she suggested. The use of the first name meant that she wanted to be on closer terms with Fuyutsuki._  
“呃……你为什么不叫我唯呢？”她提议道。使用名字意味着她想与冬月更亲近。

_Fuyutsuki mulled over as to how he should address Yui, before he said, "That'll be acceptable from now on, Yui." They then stood up and he offered his hand for her to shake. She took it and shook; it was now a deal.  
冬月思索着该如何称呼唯，然后说道：“从现在开始，这样称呼可以，唯。”他们随后站起身，他伸出手来，她握住并摇了摇；这便成了约定。_

"_Welcome to Metabiology 204, Miss Yui Ikari," he said, grinning._  
"欢迎来到《元生物学 204》，优·碇小姐，" 他笑着说。

_Yui smiled. "Thank you, Professor."  
优微笑了。“谢谢您，教授。”_

---

_Again, like an abrupt change of scene in a movie, Rei was surprised to see Yui facing Gendo, now the first time she saw the Commander in his younger form. He was then clean-shaven, the glasses absent, and his coat was open. Both were hanging around at the hallway, with the man leaning against a coffee vending machine as he banged his palm against it, apparently trying to extricate a stuck can of UCC, until they could hear the clunking sound of the can hitting the bin.  
又一次，就像电影中突兀的场景转换，丽惊讶地看到优面对着源堂，这是她第一次见到指挥官年轻时的模样。那时他还没有蓄须，眼镜也不在脸上，外套敞开着。两人站在走廊上，源堂斜靠在一台咖啡自动售货机旁，用手掌敲击着机器，显然是在试图取出卡住的 UCC 罐装咖啡，直到他们听到罐子落入回收箱的咔嗒声。_

_Rei could also overhear their conversation.  
丽还能听到他们的对话。_

"_Thanks for helping," Yui said as she reached for the can of coffee. "I thought I couldn't get my coffee… But who are you?"_  
"谢谢你的帮助，" 优依说着伸手去拿那罐咖啡。"我以为我拿不到咖啡了……但你是谁？"

_Gendo smiled. "I'm Gendo Rokobungi. I came here to finish my doctorate."  
源度微笑道："我是源堂·洛克冯吉。我来这里是为了完成我的博士学位。"_

_Yui held the can up and pulled the tab. "In what?"  
Yui 举起罐子，拉开拉环。“在什么方面？”_

"_Molecular biology," Gendo answered. "I heard stories about you, especially how you put out a term paper about the metaphysical properties of biological structures... And you're in Professor Fuyutsuki's class, am I right?"_  
“分子生物学，”碇回答道，“我听说过你的事迹，尤其是你发表的那篇关于生物结构形而上学特性的学期论文……而且你在福音津教授的课上，对吧？”

_Yui nodded. "Well, yes, I am."  
Yui 点点头。“嗯，是的，我在。”_

_Gendo sighed. "A week ago he was assigned as my adviser, in a different schedule… Morning classes, that is."  
源堂叹了口气。“一周前他被指派为我的顾问，在不同的课程表上……早上的课，也就是说。”_

"_Since you're in graduate studies, what are you working on right now?"_  
“既然你在攻读研究生，现在在研究什么？”

"_A thesis," Gendo said, as he fed the vending machine a paper bill, pressed the button for another can of coffee. As soon as the can hit the bottom bin, he picked it up and opened, before taking a sip. "It's about how to improve gene splicing techniques."_  
“一篇论文，”源堂说着，向自动售货机投入一张纸币，按下按钮再买一罐咖啡。罐子一落到底部槽，他就捡起来打开，喝了一口。“是关于如何改进基因拼接技术的。”

_Yui glanced at her wristwatch, and then she said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot."  
优依瞥了一眼手腕上的表，然后说道：“哦，对不起，我忘了。”_

_Gendo looked surprised. "What?"  
源度看起来很惊讶。“什么？”_

"_I have a class to catch," Yui said. "Why don't we continue this later?"_  
“我还有课要上，”优依说，“不如我们晚点再继续？”

"_Sure," Gendo replied. "Do you have a number, so that I can call you and we could eat out? I know a good restaurant or two." He then whipped out a small notepad and a pencil from the pocket of his coat, which he handed over to Yui. She then scribbled the number and gave both items back to Gendo._  
"当然，" 源渡回答道。"你有电话号码吗？这样我可以打给你，我们一起出去吃饭。我知道几家不错的餐厅。" 他说着从外套口袋里掏出一个小笔记本和一支铅笔，递给了唯。她随即在上面草草写下号码，然后将两样东西还给了源渡。

"_That's my number," Yui confirmed. "It's unlisted."_  
"这就是我的号码，" 唯确认道。"它是未公开的。"

_Gendo blinked. "Why?" 源渡眨了眨眼。"为什么？"_

"_I don't usually give out my number for privacy reasons. Don't want strangers calling me."_  
"我通常不会随便给出我的号码，出于隐私考虑。不想让陌生人打电话给我。"

"_I see… How can I call you? First name or surname?"_  
"我明白了……那我该怎么称呼你呢？名字还是姓氏？"

_Yui smiled. "Use my first name. It's okay for me to be called Yui instead of my two surnames. Makes me feel better."  
优微笑了。"用我的名字就好。叫我优就行，不用连名带姓的。这样让我感觉更舒服。"_

_Gendo grinned. "Ah… Okay, I'll see you later… Yui."  
源堂笑了。“啊…好吧，回头见…唯。”_

"_Thank you—"_ “谢谢你——”

"_You can call me Gendo if you want to make it personal." He stared into her eyes for a few seconds, and then nodded before walking away._  
“如果你想更亲近些，可以叫我源堂。”他凝视她的眼睛几秒钟，然后点头离去。

_Only after she saw that the man disappeared in a corner did she frowned and whispered, "Who are you?" Yui then leaned against the vending machine, before she smiled. "He looks all right," she whispered to herself, completely pleased.  
"直到她看到那男人消失在拐角处，她才皱起眉头，低声自语：“你是谁？”优依随后靠在自动售货机上，微笑起来。“他看起来还不错，”她对自己轻声说道，完全满意。”_

---

Rei was amazed to see a side of the Commander that she had never known before, but it dawned upon the girl that it was almost the same attitude he displayed before her, with the same soft eyes. Besides, with his face almost peppered with stubble instead of the beard he had today, the Commander's appearance looked a bit like an older, taller… and a darker version of Shinji.  
"丽惊讶地看到了指挥官她从未见过的一面，但随即她意识到，这几乎是他面对她时的同样态度，同样温柔的眼神。此外，他的脸颊几乎被胡茬覆盖，而不是今天的胡须，指挥官的外貌看起来有点像一个更年长、更高大……且肤色更深的真嗣。”

---

_Fuyutsuki looked surprised. "Is that true?" he asked.  
"冬月看起来很惊讶。“这是真的吗？”他问道。”_

_This time it was after classes, and both of them were alone in the classroom at the moment. Outside the hallway, and behind closed doors, they could hear the muted din of students chattering.  
这次是在课后，两人此刻单独待在教室里。走廊外，紧闭的门后，他们能听到学生们低沉的交谈声。_

_Yui nodded. "Yes, I'm going out with Rokubungi."  
Yui 点头。"是的，我和六本木在交往。"_

_The older man was speechless for a moment, until he questioned, "Are you serious?"  
年长的男人一时语塞，直到他质疑道："你是认真的吗？"_

_Yui can only manage a laugh. "Oh, sir," she said. "Surprisingly, he's such a cute man, it's just that no one really knows it."  
Yui 只能勉强笑出声来。“哦，先生，”她说道，“出人意料的是，他是个如此可爱的男人，只是没人真正了解这一点。”_

_Fuyutsuki shook his head, as if he couldn't believe it. "Ignorance can be a source of happiness," he whispered. "There's a lot of rumors about him, some of it unsavory. So I'm very much concerned about you getting involved with him, even if I'm his advisor."  
冬月摇了摇头，仿佛难以置信。“无知可以是幸福的源泉，”他低声说，“关于他的流言蜚语不少，其中有些颇为不堪。所以我非常担心你和他扯上关系，即便我是他的顾问。”_

_Noticing his reaction, Yui suddenly looked glum. "Why do you feel bothered about Rokobungi?"  
注意到他的反应，Yui 突然显得忧郁起来。“你为什么对六本木感到困扰？”_

_Fuyutsuki sighed. "Miss Ikari, I do admit that he's a very interesting man, but still I don't like him."  
冬月叹了口气。"碇小姐，我承认他是个非常有趣的人，但我还是不喜欢他。"_

_Yui shook her head. "I don't understand, but I don't care what others say about me or Rokobungi, as long as he's happy."  
优摇了摇头。“我不明白，但只要六分仪开心，我不在乎别人怎么说我或他。”_

_Silence settled between the two, deep in thoughts until Fuyutsuki broke the silence.  
两人陷入沉默，深思熟虑，直到冬月打破了沉默。_

"_I understand now what you mean," he said, shrugging. "If that's what you want, then I will not begrudge you the chance to have your own happiness, but you'll have to be careful."_  
“我现在明白你的意思了，”他耸耸肩说，“如果你想要那样，我不会嫉妒你追求自己的幸福，但你得小心。”

_Yui nodded. "I'll take your word for it. Whatever happens ahead, I'll deal with it if I can."  
Yui 点了点头。“我相信你。无论前方发生什么，只要我能应对，我就会处理。”_

"_Okay," Fuyutsuki said._

_The woman then picked up her satchel and folder off the table and walked away. Before she left the door, Yui said, "I'll see you later, Professor… and thank you for understanding what I feel."  
女人随后拿起她的手提包和文件夹，离开了桌子。在她离开门口之前，Yui 说：“再见，教授……谢谢你理解我的感受。”_

_The classroom faded into black, to be replaced with yet another scene.  
教室渐渐陷入黑暗，随即被另一个场景所取代。_

_It was a dark bedroom, with the dim light of sodium coming from the street lamp outside, where snowflakes could be seen swirling in the light breeze. Books, papers and notes were stacked on Yui's desk, but at the moment were ignored, at least for this quiet moment of togetherness. The only sounds inside was the faint hiss of the nearby gas heater that warmed the room, the radio on the bedside table playing_ Sukiyaki_, and the wet smacks of kissing._  
那是一个昏暗的卧室，街灯的昏黄灯光透过窗户洒进来，雪花在微风中旋转飘落。书本、纸张和笔记堆满了结衣的桌子，但此刻却被忽视了，至少在这宁静的共处时刻。房间里唯一的声响是附近燃气加热器的微弱嘶嘶声，床头柜上的收音机播放着《寿喜烧》，还有亲吻时湿润的吧唧声。

---

Blushing almost close to red, Rei was even more surprised; she had never seen anything like this from Commander Ikari, as she became the unseen witness to, of all things, an act of lovemaking in progress.  
脸颊几乎红得发紫，丽更加惊讶了；她从未见过碇司令这样的情景，作为未被察觉的目击者，她目睹了，所有事情中，一场正在进行的爱抚行为。

---

_They were engaged in a torrid kiss, with Gendo caressing the curvature of Yui's body, trying to get his hand beneath her blouse, and then as he kissed the nape of her neck, his fingers found the buttons and began to pick them away, opening them one by one.  
他们沉浸在热烈的亲吻中，源堂轻抚着唯身体的曲线，试图将手探入她的衬衫下，当他吻向她的后颈时，手指找到了纽扣，开始逐一解开，一颗颗地敞开。_

_He sighed, breathing in her scent, unzipping her slacks and tugged them downwards. Gendo then took off his shirt and went back to his ministrations, fingers attempting to locate the bra fasteners. He was then rewarded by a soft click, and the bra was let loose.  
他叹息着，深吸她的香气，拉下她的牛仔裤拉链并将其褪下。源堂随后脱掉自己的衬衫，继续他的爱抚，手指摸索着寻找胸罩的扣钩。终于，他听到了一声轻响，胸罩松开了。_

_Free of their clothing, they ambled to the bed and laid down, allowing their limbs to wrap around each other, as though they would deny anyone or anything to stop them from being engaged in a sensual moment of singularity, practicing a sacred dance that was still in vogue for millennia.  
摆脱了衣物的束缚，他们缓缓走向床边并躺下，四肢交缠，仿佛要拒绝任何人或事物打扰他们这独一无二的感官时刻，实践着那流传千年的神圣之舞。_

_Soon the bedroom was filled with their moans, the rare mixture of romantic pleasure and physical pain, as Gendo was ushered into Yui's temple, offering himself to be consumed by her passion until the final moment when his spirit was finally unleashed.  
很快，卧室里充满了他们的呻吟声，那种罕见的浪漫愉悦与肉体痛苦的混合，当源堂被引入唯的神殿，他献身于她的激情之中，直到最后一刻他的灵魂终于得以释放。_

_Afterwards, the couple could now allow themselves for a bit of pillow talk, with their bodies completely wrapped in blankets.  
之后，这对夫妇终于可以允许自己享受一些枕边细语，他们的身体完全被毯子包裹着。_

"_I'm sorry," Gendo whispered, his arm wrapped around the woman's shoulder. "I got carried away."_  
“对不起，”源堂低声说道，他的手臂环绕在女人的肩膀上。“我有点失控了。”

"_That's okay," Yui replied._  
“没关系，”优回答道。

"_But I'm going to be very honest with you."_  
“但我要对你非常坦诚。”

"_About what?"_ "关于什么？"

_Gendo sighed. "This is the first time I feel better with a woman… No, I've gone through many girls in my life before, but I… I think you're different, Yui."  
源度叹了口气。“这是我第一次和一个女人在一起感觉好些……不，我一生中经历过很多女孩，但我……我觉得你不一样，优。”_

"_In what way?" Yui asked._  
"以什么方式？" 唯问道。

"_You are a challenge," Gendo admitted. "I mean, it has taken me three months to convince you, and now... We've gone this far enough. Why you're a challenge? It's just that you gave me a lot to think of, and then I also had to make concessions for you."_  
"你是个挑战，" 源渡承认道。"我的意思是，我花了三个月才说服你，而现在...我们已经走得够远了。为什么说你是个挑战？只是因为你给了我很多思考的东西，然后我还得为你做出让步。"

"_I see," Yui said. "Now it's my turn to ask: why are you so interested in me?"_  
"我明白了，" 唯说。"现在轮到我问了：为什么你对我这么感兴趣？"

"_Just as I said, you're different."_  
"正如我所说，你与众不同。"

"_Are you sure?"_ "你确定吗？"

"_I swear, you're the only woman I actually loved."_  
"我发誓，你是我真正爱过的唯一女人。"

_Yui chuckled. "Cheesy classic, Gendo," she said, before the woman sighed. "I've met men before, and since high school they all came and gone. Why? It's just that some of them are either too self-centered, fueled with an excess of testosterone, or exaggerate their sensitivity."  
优伊轻笑道：“真是老套的经典台词，源堂，”她叹了口气，“我见过不少男人，从高中起他们来来去去。为什么呢？只是因为他们要么太自我中心，满脑子都是荷尔蒙，要么就是过分夸大自己的敏感。”_

_Gendo nodded. "Ah."_

"_From my POV, you're different, Mister Rokobungi. I said a request to you, and then in no time you answered it like you're moving mountains. So you're the first man in my life who's willing to fulfill an oath. You swore off brawling, and I loved you for that; you cut down your alcoholic intake to only two bottles, and you look better; and…"_  
“在我看来，六分仪先生，你与众不同。我向你提出请求，你立刻就答应了，仿佛移山填海般迅速。你是我生命中第一个愿意履行誓言的男人。你发誓不再打架，我因此爱上了你；你将饮酒量减少到仅两瓶，看起来状态更好了；而且……”

"_And what?"_

"_I've heard a rumor from the dean's office."_  
“我听到了院长办公室的传闻。”

_Gendo blinked. "What does that old fart has to do with me?"  
源堂眨了眨眼。“那个老顽固跟我有什么关系？”_

"_You're in the running for a special citation, but since it's just a rumor, don't take it very seriously."_  
“你有望获得一个特别表彰，但既然这只是个传闻，别太当真。”

"_I understand that. Fact is, I don't care if I win no award or whatever, as it's not my thing to collect trophies or pieces of paper with my name on it. I'd rather be very good at what I do, and I also want something more concrete, something that has real meaning."_  
“我明白这一点。事实上，我并不在乎是否获奖或诸如此类的事情，因为收集奖杯或印有我名字的证书不是我的兴趣。我宁愿在自己所做的事情上非常出色，并且我也想要一些更具体、更有实际意义的东西。”

"_Like what?" Yui questioned._  
"比如什么？" 唯问道。

"_Like loving you," Gendo answered, before he pushed himself to kiss Yui on the lips._  
"比如爱你，" 源度回答，随即他主动吻上了唯的唇。

Why Rei fainted? 为什么丽会晕倒？

No, why she fainted upon seeing his mother's picture?  
不，为什么她一看到他母亲的画像就晕倒了？

That was one question gnawing Shinji's mind as they waited anxiously outside the ER. He took a glance at Kaworu, who looked just as worried as he was. Normally Kaworu looked so confident as if he knew everything and sure of himself, but this moment was the exception to the rule.  
这是困扰着真嗣的问题，他们焦急地等在急诊室外。他瞥了一眼渚薰，他看起来同样忧心忡忡。通常渚薰看起来自信满满，仿佛无所不知，对自己也确信无疑，但此刻却是个例外。

Asuka, sitting besides him, sat with her arms crossed and she wore a sullen expression on her face. To her it was difficult to imagine what Rei was thinking of at the very moment that girl fainted. Perhaps the past must've hit the Wondergirl hard like an oncoming trailer truck at 90 kilometers per hour, perhaps there was more to Rei than she could ever believe, so what was exactly her connection with Shinji's mom, despite the fact that there was a gap of more than a decade between those women?  
坐在他旁边的明日香，双臂交叉，脸上带着阴郁的表情。对她来说，很难想象绫波此刻在想什么，那个女孩为什么会晕倒。或许过去像一辆时速 90 公里的拖车一样重重地打击了这位奇迹女孩，或许绫波还有她无法相信的更多秘密，那么她与真嗣的母亲究竟有什么联系，尽管她们之间有着超过十年的年龄差距？

Kaworu, meanwhile, was lost in his own thoughts, trying to make sense of it all. Earlier, as they rushed Rei to the ER, for a moment he was able to touch her and obtained a snapshot of the girl's thoughts while she was in a state of unconsciousness.  
与此同时，渚薰沉浸在自己的思绪中，试图理清这一切。早些时候，当他们急忙将绫波送往急诊室时，有那么一刻，他得以触碰到她，并在她昏迷的状态下捕捉到了女孩的思维片段。

Like flipping through a box of photographs, in his mind's eye he found himself staring at a set of very vivid afterimages, of a place that Rei had never seen before or set foot upon.  
仿佛翻阅一盒照片，在他的脑海中，他发现自己正凝视着一组异常鲜明的残影，那是一个绫波从未见过或踏足过的地方。

Of all places, what she was doing in Paris?  
在所有地方中，她为何会在巴黎？

Then Kaworu determined that somehow a very obscure past life was unlocked within the girl's mind, even before Rei was conceived, and he knew that one word might be able to describe such a case.  
于是，渚断定女孩的意识中不知何故解锁了一个极为隐秘的前世记忆，甚至在绫波诞生之前，他知道有一个词或许能形容这种情况。

_Reincarnation. 转世。_

As the old man was an ardent Cabbalist, Keel once told Kaworu about transmigration and reincarnation, called _Gilgulei Ha Neshamot_ (literally "cycle of souls"), and how they became part of their belief system, just as the Manicheans and the Gnostics believed in them, despite declarations of heresy by the mainstream orthodoxy. The concept of transmigration and reincarnation was dependent on the belief that the soul, upon the death of the mortal body, would seek a new body to inhabit and to be reborn (and not to be confused with resurrection and metamorphosis, which were different concepts).  
由于那位老人是一位热忱的卡巴拉主义者，基尔曾经向渚讲述过灵魂转世与轮回，即所谓的“灵魂循环”（Gilgulei Ha Neshamot），以及它们如何成为其信仰体系的一部分，正如摩尼教徒和诺斯替教徒也相信这些，尽管主流正统派宣布其为异端。灵魂转世与轮回的概念基于这样一种信仰：灵魂在肉体死亡后，会寻求一个新的身体来寄居并重生（而非复活与变形，这是不同的概念）。

Anyway, Kaworu mused, there are things in this plane of existence, such as reincarnation, that are beyond explanation that they served only to cause more questions to be asked than generate answers; not even science could prove or disprove certain forms of unusual phenomena.  
无论如何，渚薰沉思着，这个存在层面中有一些事物，比如轮回，它们超出了可解释的范围，与其说是产生答案，不如说是引发了更多疑问；即便是科学也无法证明或证伪某些异常现象。

Asuka sighed, the first to break the silence among them, and she said, "God, this is getting weird… No, things are becoming weirder, I think."  
明日香叹了口气，率先打破了沉默，她说道：“天哪，这越来越奇怪了……不，我觉得事情正在变得更加诡异。”

"What made you say that?" Shinji asked, but realized that ever since he came here months ago, his life was turned upside-down, with one strange occurrence after another, plus close calls with tragedy.  
“你为什么这么说？”真嗣问道，但他意识到自从几个月前来到这里，他的生活就被彻底颠覆了，一件接一件的怪事接连发生，还有与悲剧擦肩而过的惊险时刻。

"We almost got ourselves hurt," Asuka said, "almost got killed, and then… Damn, trouble seems to be looking for us."  
"我们差点就受伤了，"明日香说，"差点丧命，然后……该死，麻烦似乎总是找上我们。"

"That's not unusual in our profession," Kaworu responded.  
"这在我们的职业中并不罕见，"渚薰回应道。"

The redhead shrugged. "Yeah, I know…. But there's something I wanted to ask you, and I forgot about it since yesterday."  
红发女孩耸了耸肩。 "是啊，我知道……但我有件事想问你，从昨天开始就忘了。"

Kaworu blinked. "What is it?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。“怎么了？”

"Tell me… How did you got into my dreams, before I woke up?" she questioned, referring to the early morning where, in her drugged state on the bed, she encountered Kaworu in her dream.  
“告诉我……你是怎么进入我的梦中的，在我醒来之前？”她问道，指的是那天清晨，她在床上药效未退的状态下，梦见了渚薰。

The question surprised Shinji. "What?"  
这个问题让真嗣感到惊讶。“什么？”

"You mean yesterday?" Kaworu questioned.  
“你是说昨天吗？”渚薰问道。

Asuka nodded. "Well, yeah… I mean, let me put this straight: I saw myself in the tub, and you know what I mean, and then I heard your voice, telling me not to... Die."  
明日香点点头。“嗯，是啊……我的意思是，让我说清楚：我看到自己在浴缸里，你知道我的意思，然后我听到你的声音，告诉我不要……死。”

Shinji frowned. "How come…?"  
真嗣皱眉。“怎么会……？”

"Then the next thing I saw myself in some train station," the redhead went on, "and you appeared right before me."  
"然后下一刻，我发现自己站在某个火车站，"红发女孩继续说道，"而你就这样突然出现在我面前。"

"That's right," Kaworu confirmed.  
"没错，"渚薰确认道。"

Asuka stared right into Kaworu's eyes, as if telling him that it was time for some very candid questions. "So… Are you some sort of psychic? A mind-reader? A shrink? A magician? Or a Jedi Master?" she asked, the last 'professional' title being a joking reference to _Star Wars._  
明日香直视着渚薰的眼睛，仿佛在告诉他现在是时候回答一些非常坦率的问题了。"那么……你是某种心灵感应者？读心者？心理医生？魔术师？还是绝地大师？"她问道，最后一个'职业'头衔是对《星球大战》的玩笑式提及。

Inwardly, Kaworu felt like he'd been thrown a curve-ball of a question. He took his time to ponder, as the girl has finally put him in the spot, the hot seat.  
内心深处，渚薰感觉自己被抛出了一个曲线球般的问题。他慢慢思考，因为女孩终于让他陷入了困境，坐上了热椅。

The redhead laughed. "Come on, be honest with me," she cajoled.  
红发女孩笑了。"来吧，老实告诉我，"她哄劝道。

Kaworu sighed, figuring that Asuka may have finally figured out what he did to her on that early morning, and so he must answer her queries. "Well… I admit I have this in-born property," he confessed. "My guardian said that I have some form of extrasensory perception, a sixth sense."  
渚薰叹了口气，心想明日香可能终于发现了那天清晨他对她做了什么，所以他必须回答她的问题。"嗯…我承认我有这种天生的特质，"他坦白道。"我的监护人说我有某种超感官知觉，第六感。"

Asuka and Shinji looked surprised, eyes wide open. "Whoa, how did he saw that?" the girl questioned.  
明日香和真嗣惊讶地睁大了眼睛。“哇，他是怎么看到的？”女孩问道。

Kaworu decided that he'll have to dress and manipulate his answer, so as not to compromise his true identity. "One day," he began, "he thought I was able to read his mind, and so he put me through an ESP test, you know, the one where they show you some cards, and then you pick out one that matches the other after flipping them to show what's behind the other card."  
渚薰决定他必须打扮并巧妙地回答，以免泄露他的真实身份。“有一天，”他开始说道，“他认为我能读懂他的心思，于是让我参加了一个 ESP 测试，你知道的，就是他们给你看一些卡片，然后你翻开一张卡片，找出与另一张匹配的那张。”

Asuka nodded. "And you passed?"  
明日香点点头。“然后你通过了？”

"Yes," Kaworu answered. "是的，"卡沃鲁回答道。

The redhead grinned. "Oh, I see… What else can you do? You think you're Houdini? Copperfield?" she asked, referring to the legendary escape artist and the famed magician.  
红发女孩咧嘴一笑。“哦，我明白了……你还能做什么？你以为自己是胡迪尼？还是科波菲尔？”她问道，提及了传奇逃脱艺术家和著名魔术师。

Kaworu shook his head. "No, I'm not like them," he disagreed. "Usually I prefer to keep this only to myself, but it's only now that this is the first time I have to tell you about this."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“不，我和他们不一样，”他不同意。“通常我更喜欢将这件事保密，但现在是第一次我必须告诉你这件事。”

"But what you were doing in her dream?" Shinji asked, drawing back to the question that was said in the first place.  
“但你在她的梦里做了什么？”真嗣问道，回到了最初的问题上。

"Make her wake up," Kaworu answered. "Told her that life's worth living for."  
“让她醒来，”渚薰回答。“告诉她生命值得活下去。”

Shinji blinked. "Wait a minute… You mean, you were right there at her bed?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“等一下……你是说，你当时就在她的床边？”

"I paid her a visit. I'm that very concerned."  
“我去探望了她。我非常关心。”

Asuka frowned this time. "And what were you doing then in my room?"  
这次轮到明日香皱眉了。“那你当时在我的房间里做什么？”

"Nothing," Kaworu replied nonchalantly, as if to give her the impression that he wasn't ruffled by her blunt question. "I was then talking to you while watching you right there. You look very miserable, so that's why I paid you a visit, and that's why you saw me in your dreams."  
"没什么，" 渚薰漫不经心地回答，仿佛要让她觉得他对她直率的问题并不感到困扰。"我那时正在和你说话，同时看着你。你看起来很痛苦，所以我才来看你，这也是为什么你会梦见我。"

"Oh," Asuka blurted. "I'm sorry. I thought you were doing something weird."  
"哦，" 明日香脱口而出。"对不起，我还以为你在做什么奇怪的事。"

"In any case, should you wish for proof," Kaworu said, "I can ask the head nurse here to show you the visitation records for that time. But the bottom line is that I'm not the kind who would leave someone behind, and as much as I have advantages, short of being Superman, I'm not a show-off… and I become very concerned if I see any of you feeling unhappy."  
"无论如何，如果你需要证据，" 渚薰说，"我可以请这里的护士长给你看那段时间的探访记录。但关键是，我不是那种会抛弃别人的人，尽管我有很多优势，除非我是超人，否则我不会炫耀……如果我看到你们中的任何一个不开心，我会非常担心。"

Inwardly, Kaworu felt relieved that it was a close call. Otherwise things might have been very different if Asuka were to ask him if he was an Angel.  
渚薰内心松了一口气，还好没被问到。否则，如果明日香问他是否是使徒，情况可能会大不相同。

_The scene changed to a kitchen, where Yui, wearing a long-sleeved sweater and a pair of slacks, was preparing a cup of tea for herself. On the dinner table, her laptop was open, and around it were several folders, presumably her work. The whole house was quiet, and as Rei walked around she guessed it must be Yui's home: one wall of the living room was occupied by a large bookshelf, consisting mostly of tomes concerning Yui's profession; opposite of that was the woman's stereo component, which at the moment was playing light music.  
场景切换到了厨房，Yui 穿着长袖毛衣和一条裤子，正在为自己准备一杯茶。餐桌上，她的笔记本电脑开着，周围散落着几个文件夹，应该是她的工作资料。整个房子静悄悄的，Rei 四处走动时猜测这一定是 Yui 的家：客厅的一面墙上有一个大书架，大部分是关于 Yui 职业的书籍；对面是她的音响设备，此刻正播放着轻音乐。_

_Rei watched the woman look up at the window, staring at the morning sky, and the girl wondered what she was thinking of. Must be the Commander, perhaps away and in some place she didn't know. The girl also noticed that the calendar, tacked above the microwave oven, had a date encircled with a red marker, and written above it was simply "Gendo".  
丽看着那女人抬头望向窗外，凝视着晨空，女孩不禁好奇她在想些什么。想必是指挥官吧，或许他远行去了某个她不熟悉的地方。女孩还注意到，微波炉上方钉着的日历上，有一个日期被红色马克笔圈了起来，上方简单地写着“源堂”。_

_The date was September 13, 2000, and the oven's digital clock told her that the time was 9:24 AM.  
日期是 2000 年 9 月 13 日，微波炉的数字时钟显示现在是上午 9 点 24 分。_

_The moment of Second Impact.  
第二次冲击的时刻。_

_Suddenly there were creaking sounds, followed by wall portraits unhinged from their hooks, crashing on the floor, and Yui turned back to see that the floor was moving violently. She gasped in surprise, and thanks to repeated exercises on earthquake awareness, Yui rushed out of the house and into the street, only to witness to see the sky turn to crimson as the power poles shook and overhead wires sway. She wasn't alone, as her neighbors were running out of their homes, shouting and screaming, crying for supplications to God, Buddha, Kanon, and demanding what was really going on, fearing the terrible repeat of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and in the distance, Yui saw part of the city skyline sway along with this unidentified tremor.  
突然间，一阵吱嘎声响起，紧接着是挂在墙上的肖像从挂钩上脱落，砸在地板上，Yui 转身看到地板剧烈地晃动。她惊讶地倒吸一口气，得益于多次地震意识训练，Yui 迅速冲出房子，跑到街上，却目睹天空变成深红色，电线杆摇晃，头顶的电线摆动。她并不孤单，邻居们纷纷从家中跑出，呼喊尖叫，向神、佛、卡农祈求，追问到底发生了什么，担心可怕的 1995 年神户地震重演，而在远处，Yui 看到城市的天际线随着这未知的震动摇摆。_

_Then the earthquake was over as quickly as it began. Silence settled for a minute or two, as the shocked survivors around Yui waited for what was to come, until this stilled tableau was broken once they began to talk, but in whispers, fearing for whatever could happen in the next few hours.  
随后，地震就像开始时一样迅速结束了。沉默笼罩了一两分钟，惊魂未定的幸存者们围绕着 Yui 等待着即将发生的事情，直到这一静止的画面被打破，他们开始交谈，但只是低声细语，担心接下来几个小时可能发生的事情。_

_Remembering Gendo, Yui took out a cellphone from her pocket and tried to dial for that man's phone, only to hear a prerecorded voice reminding the woman that all lines were busy and therefore she cannot use the service until further notice.  
忆起源堂，唯从口袋里掏出手机，试图拨打那个男人的电话，却只听到一段预录的语音，提醒她所有线路正忙，因此她暂时无法使用该服务。_

_Yui sighed, wondering where Gendo was at this very moment, and it shivered her to see that the sky's crimson color intensify. The woman then walked back inside, to discover her books and CD cases had crashed upon the floor and heaped on the coffee table; cupboards with their doors open and contents spilled and shattered all over the kitchen, and her teacup was completely upturned and emptied, tea splashed on the table and dripping onto the floor; in her bedroom, countless belongings were knocked off their perches on the shelves.  
唯叹了口气，想知道源堂此刻身在何处，而天空的赤红色愈发浓烈，令她不寒而栗。她随后走回屋内，发现书籍和 CD 盒散落一地，堆在咖啡桌上；橱柜门敞开，里面的物品倾泻而出，碎裂满地；厨房里，她的茶杯完全翻倒，茶水溅在桌上，滴落到地板；卧室中，无数物品从架子上被撞落。_

_Just as she left the bedroom, Yui heard the phone ring and she took it out of her pocket again. Looking at the number on the display, it was not on her phonebook, and curious, she pressed the 'call' button.  
正当她离开卧室时，唯听到电话铃响，再次从口袋中取出手机。看着显示屏上的号码，并非通讯录中的联系人，她好奇地按下了“接听”键。_

"_It's me," Gendo said at the other end of the line._  
"是我，" 源渡在电话那头说道。

_Yui blinked. "Wha… Where are you? How are you doing? How did you manage to get your call through? There was an earthquake!" she exclaimed.  
唯眨了眨眼。"什…你在哪儿？你还好吗？你是怎么打通电话的？刚刚发生了地震！"她惊呼道。_

"_I'm okay and I'm on a plane, on my way home," Gendo answered. "Right now we're over… ah, Indonesia. I also borrowed this satellite phone from one of my associates, but I can't explain the details. Turn on the TV and tell me what's happening."_  
"我没事，正在飞机上，正在回家的路上，" 源渡回答。"现在我们正飞越…啊，印度尼西亚。我也是从一位朋友那里借来的卫星电话，具体细节我无法解释。打开电视，告诉我现在的情况。"

_Yui walked over to the television set and turned it on. The screen was filled with breaking-news reports as she flipped channels, and the network news anchors all told her that, according to seismologists, an unusually powerful earthquake had originated from Antarctica, with an astonishing 10.2 on the Richter scale, and was now responsible for the shockwave that rocked the world. At the moment, the anchors said, officials were trying to get an assessment of casualties and the extent of damage. They also warned of possible aftershocks and a tsunami, which citizens must be prepared for.  
优依走到电视机前，打开了它。屏幕上充斥着突发新闻报道，她切换频道时，所有网络新闻主播都告诉她，据地震学家称，一场异常强烈的地震起源于南极洲，震级高达惊人的 10.2 级，现在正引发全球范围内的冲击波。目前，主播们表示，官员们正试图评估伤亡人数和损害程度。他们还警告可能会有余震和海啸，提醒市民做好准备。_

_As the newscasters droned, Yui said into the phone, "There's been a large earthquake down at Antarctica."  
当新闻播报员喋喋不休时，优依对着电话说：“南极洲发生了一场大地震。”_

"_How big?" Gendo asked._ “有多大？”源堂问道。

"_10.2," Yui answered, quoting the official Richter figure._  
"10.2," 结衣回答，引用了官方的里氏震级。

"_Pack your belongings. You must leave immediately!"_  
“收拾好你的行李。你必须立刻离开！”

_Yui blinked. "What?"_

"_Just get going and move to higher ground," he warned. "It's not safe for you to be where you're standing on right now. As for this plane, I'm afraid that we'll be up in the air for a little longer, so don't panic, everything will be fine."_  
“赶紧走，往高处去，”他警告道，“你现在站的地方不安全。至于这架飞机，恐怕我们还得在空中多待一会儿，别慌，一切都会好的。”

_Without warning the TV set flickered off, and the refrigerator motor wound down. The whole place was now under blackout, blanketed with deafening silence.  
电视突然熄灭，冰箱的马达也渐渐停止了运转。整个地方陷入了停电状态，被震耳欲聋的寂静所笼罩。_

"_Okay," Yui said, the phone pinched between her ear and shoulder as she rushed to the bedroom, grabbed a travel case and opened it. "Auntie Sayako has a vacation house in Ofuse. It's not far from here, right up north and in the mountains."_  
"好的，" 结衣说道，手机夹在耳朵和肩膀之间，她急忙冲进卧室，抓起一个旅行箱并打开。"纱代子阿姨在尾伏有一处度假屋。离这儿不远，就在北边的山上。"

"_I know. She told me about it, but I forgot something: does that house have a phone?"_  
"我知道。她跟我说过，但我忘了件事：那房子有电话吗？"

"_Sorry, but no," she answered while grabbing as much clothing she can carry from the cabinet, and stuffing them all into the case._  
"抱歉，没有，" 她回答着，从衣柜里尽可能多地抓起衣服，一股脑儿塞进箱子里。"

"_Never mind, I'll try to reach you there as soon as the plane lands."_  
"没关系，我会尽快在飞机降落后赶到你那里。"

_But Yui paused for a moment, to note that the beam of sunlight was not in its proper angle, as what she expected it to be; normally the sun should be almost riding low on the morning sky, but now, as she looked outside from the window, she was astonished to see that the sun was now almost high; and she also felt that the air was also unnaturally warmer, as if the usual coolness of autumn was totally obliterated by the earthquake.  
但 Yui 停顿了一下，注意到阳光的角度并不如她预期的那样；通常太阳应该在早晨的天空中几乎低垂，但现在，当她从窗户往外看时，她惊讶地发现太阳几乎高悬；她还感觉到空气异常温暖，仿佛秋天的凉爽完全被地震抹去了。_

"_Yui?" Gendo asked, wondering why she was silent. "Are you there?"_  
"Yui？" 源堂问道，疑惑她为何沉默。"你在吗？"

"_My God," Yui muttered into the phone. By then she was sweating due to the increased heat and humidity, forcing her to take off and toss away the sweater, and the woman resumed packing._  
"天哪，" 唯对着电话喃喃自语。那时她因加剧的热度和湿度而汗流浃背，不得不脱下并扔掉毛衣，随后继续打包。

"_Tell me, what's wrong?"_ "告诉我，出什么事了？"

"_The sun… It's in the wrong place."_  
"太阳…位置不对。"

"_So?" Gendo sounded skeptical._  
"所以呢？" 源渡听起来有些怀疑。

"_Look out from the window, and you'll see what I mean."_  
"往窗外看看，你就会明白我的意思了。"

_There was a minute or two of silence, as she could hear Gendo whisper excuses in English, probably trying to reach the nearby window.  
有那么一两分钟，她能听到源渡用英语低声道歉，大概是试图靠近附近的窗户。_

"_Damn, you're right," Gendo finally said after a moment. "The Earth's axis is possibly out of its normal alignment."_  
"该死，你说得对，" 碇源堂终于在片刻后说道。"地球的自转轴可能已经偏离了正常位置。"

"_What?"_

"_I'll explain later about that as soon as we see each other; I don't have much time on this phone any longer. Just go and get away from trouble as far as possible, okay?"_  
"见面后我会详细解释；这通电话我时间不多了。尽量远离麻烦，好吗？"

"_Okay," Yui answered. "I love you. Be safe."_  
“好的，”优回答，“我爱你。注意安全。”

"_I love you too. See you later, and take care of yourself."_  
“我也爱你。再见，照顾好自己。”

_Now, as she put away the phone back into her pocket, Yui could hear the loud shrill of the emergency sirens, as though a grave disaster from the south was imminent, and would soon strike and devastate the entire country.  
此刻，她将手机放回口袋，优听到了紧急警报的尖锐声响，仿佛一场来自南方的严重灾难即将来临，很快就会袭击并摧毁整个国家。_

From time to time Ritsuko checked the girl's EEG output. Same situation, except for some spikes on the readings. Between those periodical checks on the girl's condition, Ritsuko went about reading, on Misato's laptop, more of Kaji's voluminous dossier full of his personal investigations.  
时不时地，律子会检查女孩的脑电波输出。情况依旧，只是读数上有些尖峰。在这些定期检查女孩状况的间隙，律子继续在美里笔记本电脑上阅读更多加持的庞大档案，里面满是他个人调查的资料。

"These aren't on the MAGI," she said while scrolling page after page of documents.  
“这些不在 MAGI 系统里，”她一边说，一边翻阅着一页又一页的文件。

"Damn sure they're not," Misato answered. "He went just about anywhere getting as much dirt and 'black' info as he can, even into places you and I don't have an idea about."  
“当然不在，”美里回答，“他几乎无所不至，尽可能搜集了大量污点和‘黑色’信息，甚至深入到你我都不了解的地方。”

"Only the Commander and the Professor knows for sure," Ritsuko said, referring to Gendo and Fuyutsuki, who were both deep into the matter than any of them. "Do you want to pass them on to the Sub-Commander?"  
"只有指挥官和教授确切知道，" 律子说道，指的是源堂和冬月，他们对此事的了解比任何人都深入。"你想把这消息转告给副指挥官吗？"

Misato nodded. "Sure, why not? He's been waiting for an opportunity like this to happen. He also told me that before, he wanted to spill the beans, but the Commander thought otherwise and had the old man change his mind."  
美里点头。"当然，为什么不呢？他一直在等待这样的机会。他还告诉我，之前他想透露真相，但指挥官不同意，让那位老人改变了主意。"

"Well, if this stuff goes public… The trouble is that not everyone's gonna be pleased,"  
"好吧，如果这些事情公之于众……问题是，并非所有人都会感到高兴，"  
Natsumi said. "It'll be like the Wikipee incident five years ago, you know, exposed classified cables and materials, only much bigger."  
夏美说道。“这会像五年前维基皮事件那样，你知道的，泄露机密电缆和材料，只是规模更大。”

Wikipee was a website operated by activists and whistle-blowers, whose biggest revelation coup included the exposure of classified diplomatic cables that the US government thought to be secured from public eyes. The resulting aftermath caused diplomatic repercussions on a global scale, which included widespread criticism of US foreign policy; in response world governments and other individuals targeted the website, with repeated attempts to bring down the organization's web servers and arrest its operators.  
维基皮是一个由活动家和举报人运营的网站，其最大的揭秘行动包括曝光了美国政府认为对公众保密的外交电报。由此引发的后果在全球范围内造成了外交影响，其中包括对美国外交政策的广泛批评；作为回应，世界各国政府和其他个人纷纷针对该网站，多次试图击垮其网络服务器并逮捕其运营者。

"Which is why," Misato said, "I think it'll be better for the Sub-Commander to decide whether to keep this stuff locked away or not. But still, this could be our trump card… It might save us if we use it right." The woman then looked at Rei, still lying on the bed. "How much longer?" she asked.  
“这就是为什么，”美里说，“我认为副指挥官决定是否将这些东西锁起来会更好。不过，这可能是我们的王牌……如果我们用对了，它可能会救我们一命。”女人随后看向仍然躺在床上的丽。“还要多久？”她问道。

Ritsuko glanced at her watch. It was more than thirty minutes since they brought Rei here. She shook her head. "I don't know for sure."  
律子瞥了一眼手表。他们把绫波带到这里已经超过三十分钟了。她摇了摇头。"我不确定。"

Misato frowned. "What?" 美里皱了皱眉。“什么？”

"I mean, I've never seen anything like this happening to her."  
“我是说，我从没见过她这样。”

"Maybe there's an answer somewhere in those files," Misato suggested. "After all, even if we already know that she's practically a clone, there's a lot more about Rei that we don't know yet… So how deep is the rabbit's warren?" she asked, referring to a place in _Alice in Wonderland._  
“也许那些文件里能找到答案，”美里提议道，“毕竟，尽管我们知道她几乎是个克隆体，但对于绫波，我们还有很多不了解的地方……所以，兔子洞有多深呢？”她借用了《爱丽丝梦游仙境》中的一个地方来比喻。

_In a darkened chamber and in the middle of a floor chiseled with a Cabbalist diagram, Yui was now wearing a simple white linen robe, as she was surrounded by ten other members of SEELE, their heads shrouded by the hoods of their robes as they chanted in an unknown language. Standing right before her was Keel Lorenz, dressed in a black robe and wearing a ceremonial chest plate made of gold and brass, encrusted with glittering jewels.  
在一间昏暗的密室中，地板上刻着卡巴拉主义的图腾，Yui 此刻身着一件简单的白色亚麻长袍，被 SEELE 的其他十名成员环绕，他们的头部被长袍的兜帽遮住，用一种未知的语言吟唱着。站在她正前方的是 Keel Lorenz，身着黑色长袍，胸前佩戴着一件由金铜制成、镶嵌着闪耀宝石的仪式胸甲。_

"_Before you shall be accepted as one of our own," Keel said sternly. "Kneel down to prepare yourself for consecration."_  
“在你被接纳为我们中的一员之前，”Keel 严肃地说道，“跪下，准备接受圣化。”

"_Yes, High Master," Yui answered, using Keel's formal title within the circle, as she nodded in obedience and knelt down on the floor, for the initiation ceremony to begin._  
“是，高阶大师，”Yui 回答道，使用圈子内对 Keel 的正式尊称，她点头表示服从并跪在地板上，为即将开始的入会仪式做准备。

"_Apprentice Saint-Clair," Keel began, "you shall not move except when your lips must respond to any question that I say, as I shall recite this sacred pledge for you to obey and remember from this day onward. Before we begin, you must be purified."_  
“圣克莱尔学徒，”Keel 开始说道，“除了回答我的问题时必须开口外，你不得移动。我将为你诵读这份神圣誓言，从今日起你必须遵守并牢记。在我们开始之前，你必须接受净化。”

_There was a moment of silence as Keel walked over to a brazier and picked up a swinging incense holder, wreathing them in smoke as though purifying her for this very moment. Once done, Keel returned the holder back to its place and waddled back to Yui, who remained motionless.  
Keel 走到一个火盆旁，拿起一个摇摆的香炉，让烟雾缭绕在他们周围，仿佛在为这一刻净化她。完成后，Keel 将香炉放回原位，蹒跚地回到 Yui 身边，Yui 依然保持静止不动。_

"_Apprentice Yui Ikari Saint-Clair, daughter of our late Brother Armand L'Eglise Saint-Clair," Keel recited, "Have you prepared your soul to accept what you would become?"_  
"学徒绫波唯·伊卡里圣克莱尔，已故兄弟阿尔芒·莱格里斯·圣克莱尔之女，"基尔念道，"你准备好接受你将成为的身份了吗？"

"_Yes, High Master."_ "是的，高阶大师。"

"_Do you have the courage and the heart to take this sacred responsibility as a member of this council?"_  
"你是否有勇气和心志承担起作为本议会成员的神圣责任？"

"_Yes, High Master."_ "是的，高师。"

"_Are you willing to defend our sacred ideals, doctrine and our aspirations? Even to the point of death?"_  
“你愿意捍卫我们的神圣理念、教义和我们的抱负吗？甚至不惜牺牲生命？”

"_Yes, High Master."_ "是的，高师。"

"_Do you have the wisdom to understand the complexities that our congregation faces and must resolve them?"_  
"你是否拥有理解我们教会所面临复杂问题的智慧，并能解决它们？"

"_Yes, High Master."_ "是的，高阶大师。"

"_Even if you are a woman, do you have the capacity to overcome even the limitations of your gender?"_  
"即便身为女性，你是否具备超越性别限制的能力？"

"_Yes, High Master."_ "是的，高师。"

_The old man coughed to clear his throat, before continuing. "If you be made a member, you must promise that you must keep the secrets of our holy congregation a secret, that the uninitiated and the heretics do not deserve to know, that you maintain this secrecy until your last breath, lest that if you violate any of the laws that were created to ensure our survival and integrity, you will be at risk of being erased. Is that understood?"  
老人清了清喉咙，继续说道：“如果你被接纳为成员，你必须承诺保守我们神圣集会的秘密，那些未被启蒙者和异端不配知晓的秘密，你必须保持这份秘密直至你生命的最后一刻，否则如果你违反了确保我们生存和完整性的任何法律，你将面临被抹除的风险。明白了吗？”_

"_Yes, High Master. My life is forfeit in your hands."_  
"是的，高师。我的生命已交托于您手中。"

_Pleased, Keel took a breath and said, "Arise."  
满意地点头，基尔深吸一口气，说道：“起来吧。”_

_Dutifully, Yui stood up and closed her eyes, as two robed acolytes stepped forward from the darkness, with one holding a gold goblet and the other a wooden box gilded with gold leaf.  
尤依顺从地站起身，闭上双眼，此时两名身披长袍的侍僧从暗处走上前来，一人手持金杯，另一人则捧着一个镶金叶的木盒。_

_The first acolyte walked towards Yui, proffered the goblet to the woman, who then carefully took it with both hands. She then stared at first at the liquid sloshing in the cup.  
第一位侍僧走向尤依，将金杯递给她，尤依双手谨慎地接过。她先是凝视着杯中摇晃的液体。_

"_Should you be considered unworthy," Keel said, "might as well that the wine that you are about to drink could become a poison to kill you. Drink then, to prove your innocence."_  
"如果你被认为不配，"基尔说，"那么你即将喝下的酒可能会变成毒药杀死你。喝吧，以此证明你的清白。"

_As directed, Yui tipped the goblet and she consumed all of the wine until empty. She allowed the wine to settle within her body, waiting for the inevitable… but nothing happened. Satisfied, Yui gently gave the empty goblet to the acolyte standing by.  
按照指示，Yui 举起高脚杯，将酒一饮而尽。她让酒在体内沉淀，等待着不可避免的结果……但什么也没有发生。满意后，Yui 轻轻将空杯递给了站在一旁的侍僧。_

_The second acolyte with the box walked close to the woman, nodded to the first acolyte to open the box, who then pulled out a black robe; on the back of this robe was the SEELE emblem, embroidered in white and silver thread: seven eyes before an inverted triangle, split by a line in the middle from top to bottom, encircled by a striking serpent, and an apple enclosed the words_ Uberm Sternenzelt richtet Gott, wie wir gerichtet.  
拿着盒子的第二位侍僧走近女子，向第一位侍僧点头示意打开盒子，后者随即取出一件黑色长袍；长袍背面绣着 SEELE 的徽章，用白色和银色丝线绣成：七只眼睛位于倒三角之前，被一条从上至下的线分割，环绕着一条引人注目的蛇，一个苹果包裹着文字“Uberm Sternenzelt richtet Gott, wie wir gerichtet”。

_Without hesitation Yui disrobed, the white robe dropped to the marble floor, revealing herself to be naked beneath the garment, save for a linen loincloth, to show them that she had nothing to fear, and the acolyte with the box took it away while the other ambled forward to clothe the woman with the new robe.  
毫不犹豫地，Yui 脱下了白色长袍，任其滑落在冰冷的大理石地面上，除了腰间的一块亚麻布遮羞，她赤裸着身体，以此向他们展示她无所畏惧。手持盒子的见习修女将其取走，而另一名见习修女则缓缓上前，为 Yui 披上新的长袍。_

_Once she finally wore the robe, as the acolyte straightened it out before the acolytes went back to their stations in the dark, only then Yui allowed herself to raise her head, scan the men surrounding her before facing Keel, staring at the old man's eyes hidden beneath a pair of shades.  
直到她终于穿上了长袍，见习修女们整理好她的衣着，回到黑暗中的岗位后，Yui 才允许自己抬起头来，环视围在她周围的男人们，最后面对着 Keel，凝视着那双隐藏在墨镜下的老者之眼。_

_It was time for confirmation.  
确认的时刻到了。_

"_Verily," Keel announced, "by the divine authority given to me as High Master, Archpriest of this august council, Magus and keeper of all arcane secrets and sacred knowledge, and the hand that guides mankind from this carnal world to enlightenment and into the fold, my Lord, bless our new member, Yui Ikari Saint-Clair, daughter of our late Brother Armand L'Eglise Saint-Clair, with your pure and sacred spirit, that her purpose and the knowledge she possesses shall serve the best interests of this congregation will be acknowledged by your divine authority. With this robe she wears, the robe represents her ascendancy into our ranks, the acceptance of her enlightenment, and to welcome her as a Sister and an equal."_  
“诚然，”基尔宣布，“凭借我作为大导师、本庄严议会的首席祭司、魔法师及所有奥秘与神圣知识的守护者，以及引导人类从这尘世走向启迪与归宿之手的神圣权威，我的主，请以您纯净神圣的灵赐福我们新成员，绫波唯·伊卡里圣克莱尔，已故兄弟阿尔芒·莱格里斯·圣克莱尔之女，愿她的使命与所掌握的知识能为本教会的最高利益服务，并得到您的神圣认可。她所穿的这件长袍，象征着她晋升我们的行列，接受启迪，并欢迎她作为姐妹与平等一员。”

_Within herself, Yui felt a bit lighthearted and dazed with the realization that she was no longer an Apprentice.  
在内心深处，绫波唯感到一丝轻松与恍惚，意识到自己不再是学徒。_

_She was now one of the Elders, part of the high and sacred cabal of SEELE.  
她现在已是长老之一，成为 SEELE 中崇高神圣的秘密团体的一员。_

_Keel allowed himself a bit of a smile, before he declared, "Welcome, Sister Yui Ikari Saint-Clair… and congratulations."  
基尔允许自己露出一丝微笑，随后宣布道：“欢迎，绫波唯·伊卡里圣克莱尔……恭喜你。”_

_Yui bowed in acknowledgement. "Thank you, High Master," she replied.  
唯点头致谢。“谢谢您，高阶大师，”她回答道。_

_Suddenly the great chamber exploded with the sound of clapping and loud chants of "Halleluia", as more torches on the walls were lit to announce Yui's ascension to the council.  
突然间，大厅内爆发出雷鸣般的掌声和响亮的“哈利路亚”呼声，随着墙壁上的更多火炬被点燃，宣告唯晋升为议会成员。_

---

With this scene being played out before Rei, it was the probably the crux as to why the Commander was single-minded in his purpose, why he mobilized gargantuan amounts of resources to get her back, and...  
在丽面前上演的这一幕，或许是指挥官一心一意的原因所在，他调动庞大资源将她寻回，以及……

Why he made Rei almost into Yui's image, and chose the name for her.  
为何他将丽塑造得近乎于唯的形象，并为她取名。

On one hand he insisted that he loved her, but on the other… He desired access to power, to gain something bigger than himself. But that was made irrelevant, as a final two scenes appeared for Rei to witness, this time through the eyes of the woman who bore Shinji.  
一方面他坚称爱她，另一方面……他渴望权力，想要获得超越自身的东西。但这一切都变得无关紧要，因为最后两幕出现在丽眼前，这次是通过生下真嗣的女人的视角。

---

_They were in a room of a private hospital in Odawara, the best within this part of the country. But being the best in a time after the Second Impact meant exorbitant prices and fees, which Gendo Ikari was able to afford with his princely monthly salary of about US$200,000, unthinkable for a man who was in charge of a small laboratory, yet considering the grave circumstances Japan was stuck in, the Ikaris were the lucky ones.  
他们身处小田原的一家私立医院内，这里是国内这一带最好的医疗机构。但在第二次冲击后的时代，成为最好的意味着高昂的价格和费用，这些对于每月薪水高达约 20 万美元的碇源堂来说，却是能够负担的，这对于一个负责小型实验室的人来说是难以想象的。然而，考虑到日本所处的严峻形势，碇家算是幸运的了。_

_Lying on bed was Yui, who knew that anytime within 24 hours she would give birth. It was almost a year after Second Impact, the country struggling to recover from the cataclysm, with more than half of the Japanese population killed by the tsunami, followed by anarchy, and then the nuclear attack on Tokyo, which sparked the Second Korean War. In the aftermath, the United States was forced to assist Japan for the second time, occupying the country with troops to keep the peace, to provide humanitarian assistance, and to disallow foreign 'carpetbaggers' from exploiting the dispossessed citizens.  
躺在床上的是唯，她知道在接下来的 24 小时内随时可能分娩。这距离第二次冲击已近一年，国家仍在努力从这场灾难中恢复，超过半数的日本人口死于海啸，随后是混乱无序，接着是东京遭受核攻击，引发了第二次朝鲜战争。在战后，美国被迫第二次援助日本，派遣军队占领该国以维持和平，提供人道主义援助，并阻止外国‘投机者’剥削无助的公民。_

_Anyway, the couple was able to get into this rather opulent hospital and score a decent room and the best doctors possible, but elsewhere health services, including government-run hospitals and clinics, have become mediocre as there were too few doctors left alive to treat too many survivors, creating a medical crisis.  
无论如何，这对夫妇得以进入这家相当豪华的医院，获得了一间不错的病房和可能找到的最好医生，但其他地方的医疗服务，包括政府运营的医院和诊所，却变得平庸不堪，因为幸存的医生太少，无法治疗太多的幸存者，从而引发了一场医疗危机。_

_Yui stroked her abdomen, as if to reassure the unborn within her womb that he or she'll be all right. She then thought of the idea of what sort of name they would give to the newborn.  
Yui 轻抚着她的腹部，仿佛在安慰她子宫中未出生的孩子，告诉他或她会没事的。随后，她开始思考会给新生儿取什么样的名字。_

_"Have you decided?" Yui asked, as Gendo was standing right by her side; the man was holding his can of coffee.  
“你决定了吗？”Yui 问道，Gendo 就站在她身边；这个男人手里拿着他的咖啡罐。_

_Gendo sighed, before he said, "Let's see… I'll name our child Shinji if it's a boy… Rei if it's a girl."  
源堂叹了口气，然后说道：“让我想想……如果是男孩就叫真嗣……如果是女孩就叫丽。”_

_Yui nodded. "Shinji… Rei," she whispered, but her mind was playing with the names as she stared right up at the ceiling: Shinji... Rei… Shinji... Shinji... Ayanami... Shinji? Rei... Rei... Ikari... Rei?  
"Yui 点了点头。“真嗣…丽，”她低声呢喃，但她的思绪却在天花板下反复玩味着这些名字：真嗣...丽…真嗣...真嗣...绫波...真嗣？丽...丽...碇...丽？”_

_No, it can't be, Yui thought, shaking her head as an idea finally caught up with the woman. If it's a girl... Ayanami Rei.  
不，不可能，Yui 心想，摇着头，一个念头终于抓住了她的思绪。如果是女孩的话...绫波丽。_

---

_"Why's there a child here?" Fuyutsuki questioned. Out there, Unit-01 stood, restrained with braces, hoses and cables connected to the purplish man-made leviathan, despite being half-finished.  
“为什么这里会有个孩子？”冬月问道。外面，初号机矗立着，被支架、软管和电缆束缚，尽管只完成了一半，却已与那紫色的机械巨人相连。_

_"This is Chief Ikari's son," Naoko answered, and she looked uncomfortable with the boy's presence. The conversation caught Shinji's attention and he turned around to see them.  
“这是碇司令的儿子，”直子回答道，看起来对男孩的出现感到不自在。这番对话引起了真嗣的注意，他转过身来看到他们。_

_Glancing at the main screen, piping in the video feed from the Entry Plug, Fuyutsuki took the microphone and spoke into it. "Ikari," he said, sounding worried. "This isn't kindergarten, and today is supposed to be a very important day."  
瞥了一眼主屏幕，接入插入栓的视频信号，冬月拿起麦克风说道。“碇，”他的声音听起来很担忧。“这里不是幼儿园，今天应该是非常重要的一天。”_

_His mother, sitting in a prototype of an Entry Plug, right in the very heart of Unit-01, looked back at Fuyutsuki and said, "Sorry, Doctor Fuyutsuki. It's my fault that I brought him here."  
他的母亲坐在一个插入栓的原型机中，正位于初号机的核心位置，回头看向冬月并说道：“抱歉，冬月博士。是我带他来这里的。”_

_"But... Yui, it's your contact experiment today. We're not supposed to have him around, and this is a risky time to do so."  
“但是...结衣，今天是你的接触实验。我们本不该让他靠近，这时候这么做很冒险。”_

_She shook his head, as if her decision was something little to worry about. "That's why. You said today's important, so I want to show the promising future to my son." Yui then took a deep breath, and her hands started to check the controls, pushing buttons, flipping switches. "Begin operation," she said. "Stage One is a go."  
她摇了摇头，仿佛她的决定不值一提。“正因为如此。你说过今天很重要，所以我想向我的儿子展示一个有希望的未来。”唯深吸了一口气，双手开始检查控制装置，按下按钮，拨动开关。“开始操作，”她说道。“第一阶段，启动。”_

_Immediately the control room exploded into activity, with technicians announcing whatever they read off the displays:  
控制室立刻陷入一片忙碌，技术人员们纷纷报告着从显示屏上读取的数据：_

"_Initial plug depth is set at 0.105. Internal pressure at one atmosphere."  
初始插头深度设定为 0.105。内部压力维持在一个大气压。  
"Monitors and recorders are up and running. Confirm sensor self-check… Done."  
监控器和记录仪已启动并运行。确认传感器自检……完成。  
"Scanning bioelectrical activity… No anomalies."  
"扫描生物电活动…无异常。"  
"Begin electrolyte injection… Now."  
"开始电解质注射…现在。"_

_Orange liquid began to flood the plug, engulfing Yui until it was full. While breathing in the oxygen-rich liquid, the preparations were still ongoing, and she could still hear the voices from control room.  
橙色液体开始涌入插头，淹没了唯，直到完全充满。在吸入富含氧气的液体的同时，准备工作仍在进行，她仍能听到控制室传来的声音。_

"_Main power supply is now connected."  
"主电源现已连接。"  
"Oxygen and nitrogen mixture is at optimum levels. Exchangers are at full capacity."  
"氧氮混合物处于最佳水平。交换器满负荷运行。"  
"Cross-checking synapses. Detecting bioelectrical activity… 2.566 volts."  
"正在交叉检查突触。检测生物电活动……2.566 伏特。"  
"Roger that. Core temperature is stable, holding at 38 degrees."  
"收到。核心温度稳定，保持在 38 度。"  
"Restraint bolts fully secured and interlocked."  
"约束螺栓已完全锁定并互锁。"_

_For a moment Yui sighed, thinking of the explorers before her who went out into the unknown before: the people who reached the poles, the summit of Mount Everest, the depths of the Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean, and finally, the surface of the Moon.  
一时间，Yui 叹了口气，想起了在她之前踏入未知领域的探险者们：那些抵达南北极、珠穆朗玛峰顶、太平洋挑战者深渊底部，以及最终登上月球表面的人们。_

_Now she felt she was like those explorers, about to embark on a journey to an uncharted region of science, beyond the frontier of existence.  
此刻，她感觉自己如同那些探险者，即将踏上一场前往科学未知领域的旅程，超越存在的边界。_

_But this wasn't for her ego; this was for survival, an insurance policy for Shinji's benefit; she knew that someday he'll be here, and would try to watch him over, high water or hell.  
但这并非为了她的自我满足；这是为了生存，为了真嗣的利益而设的保险；她知道有一天他会来到这里，无论风高浪急还是地狱深渊，她都会尽力守护他。_

"_Initiate Stage Two," Yui commanded._  
“启动第二阶段，”唯命令道。

"_Roger that, Doctor. Now lowering plug to 0.120."  
"收到，博士。现在将插头降至 0.120。"  
"We got activity across the board."  
"各处都有活动迹象。"  
"Pattern Green, Doctor. Is that okay?"  
"绿色模式，博士。这样可以吗？"_

"_That's not a problem," Yui answered. "All my gauges are in the zone here, so keep going."_  
"那不是问题，" 结衣回答道。"我这里的所有仪表都在正常范围内，所以继续前进吧。"

"_Psychograph shows no sign of instability."  
"心理图谱显示没有不稳定迹象。"  
"Plug depth adjusted to 0.128."  
"插头深度已调整为 0.128。"_

_Yui closed her eyes for a moment, thinking whether to go further with her own last-minute parameters or just be content with the system settings that were officially specified prior to the experiment. She then thought of the final threat Keel had issued to her last week after a very heated argument: they wouldn't hesitate to kill her to protect their interests, especially issues surrounding the implementation of the Human Instrumentality Project; now they marked Yui an anathema, a traitor and a heretic to the rest of the old men who held absolute power in their hands.  
优闭上眼睛片刻，思考是继续使用自己最后一刻设定的参数，还是满足于实验前官方指定的系统设置。随后，她想起了上周与基尔激烈争吵后他发出的最后通牒：为了保护他们的利益，尤其是在实施人类补完计划相关的问题上，他们绝不会犹豫杀掉她。现在，优被那些掌握绝对权力的老人们视为禁忌、叛徒和异端。_

_It so reminded of the situation faced by her ancient and yet obscure ancestor, when it came to dealing with a sexist adversary who thought that women have no place in religion and society, that women are inferior and should be kept in the background. Yui also remembered a passage that she once read, from a copy of an ancient text that the paternal side of her family had kept secret for centuries: "Peter makes me hesitate: I am afraid of him, because he hates the female race."  
这让她想起了她那古老而鲜为人知的祖先所面临的情境，当时要对付一个认为女性在宗教和社会中没有地位、认为女性低人一等应被置于幕后的性别歧视者。优还记得她曾读过的一段话，来自她父系家族秘密保存了几个世纪的古籍副本：“彼得让我犹豫：我害怕他，因为他憎恨女性种族。”_

_When the time came to discuss as to how it should be done, Keel aggressively insisted on using their form of Instrumentality, as instructed in the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls, in which all life would be reset completely, so that there would be a pure world without sin; Yui disagreed, arguing that Instrumentality need not to be implemented by means of annihilation, but instead use Eva as the means to tell the rest of the universe that humanity has triumphed in the face of many adversities and still had a hopeful chance at redemption.  
当讨论到应该如何实施时，基尔强硬地坚持按照《死海古卷秘录》中的指示，采用他们的形式进行人类补完计划，即彻底重置所有生命，以创造一个无罪纯净的世界；而唯则持反对意见，认为补完计划不必通过毁灭来实现，而是可以利用 Eva 向宇宙宣告，人类在面对诸多逆境后依然取得了胜利，并拥有改过自新的希望。_

_Yet unanimously the rest of the council decided that Keel's course of action was far better and more absolute; they intended not to live long in a world they thought to be dirty and hopeless… and as she stood in the way, a thorn in their sides, they wanted her dead.  
然而，委员会的其他成员一致认为基尔的方案更为优越和绝对；他们不打算在一个自认为肮脏无望的世界中长久生存……而她站在他们的对立面，成了他们眼中的眼中钉，他们想要除掉她。_

_Finally she remembered the conversation she had with Fuyutsuki a year ago, about her own intent, her worries about personal safety and hopes for the future.  
最终，她想起了去年与冬月的那次对话，关于她自己的意图、对个人安全的担忧以及对未来的希望。_

_There was no turning back this time. This experiment was her own idea, to prove that Eva lives as a biological entity, and at the same time, deny her enemies the opportunity to 'erase' her completely and use the Evas for their own nefarious purposes.  
这次没有回头路了。这项实验是她自己的主意，旨在证明 Eva 作为生物实体的存在，同时剥夺敌人彻底‘抹去’她并利用 Eva 达到其邪恶目的的机会。_

_She will integrate herself with this Eva and her core, even if it meant that her corporeal form will also have to be sacrificed in exchange, and from there she would wait for Shinji… and by the time that her child becomes almost a man, everything would come in full circle.  
她将把自己与这个 Eva 及其核心融合，即便这意味着她的肉体形态也必须为此牺牲，从此她将等待真嗣……等到她的孩子几乎成长为一个男人时，一切都将圆满。_

_With nothing more for her to fear, now it was time for the next step.  
无所畏惧的她，现在该迈出下一步了。_

"_Initiate connection to the A10 nerve," Yui ordered._  
"启动与 A10 神经的连接，" 唯命令道。

"_Roger that, Doctor. Negotiating connection to A10, target voltage and current is matched, and… 10… 9… 8… 7…"_  
"收到，博士。正在协商连接至 A10，目标电压和电流已匹配，并且… 10… 9… 8… 7…"

"_Professor," Yui called out, singling out Fuyutsuki, who was watching back at her and Unit-01 as the countdown was spoken._  
"教授，" 唯呼唤道，特意指向了正在观看倒计时的冬月，以及零壹号机。

"_Yes?" the older man replied._  
“什么事？”年长者回应道。

_Yui sighed. "Tell Gendo that he should take care of Shinji for my sake," she said, as the woman stared into Shinji's eyes. Watching behind the thick glass windows, the young boy looked fragile, unaware of what was to come.  
Yui 叹了口气。“告诉 Gendo，为了我，他应该照顾好 Shinji，”她一边说，一边凝视着 Shinji 的眼睛。透过厚厚的玻璃窗，那个小男孩看起来脆弱无助，对即将发生的事情一无所知。_

_Fuyutsuki blinked. "What do you mean? Why?" he questioned.  
Fuyutsuki 眨了眨眼。“你这是什么意思？为什么？”他问道。_

_The technician called down the last few seconds: "… 6… 5… 4… 3… 2… 1… Engaging A10!"  
技术人员倒数最后几秒：“……6……5……4……3……2……1……启动 A10！”_

_At this very moment, however, klaxons blared out; it meant serious trouble.  
然而，就在这一刻，警报声大作；这意味着严重的问题。_

"_It's because I want him to know that—" she said, but was cut off short, for there was an unexpected bright flash of light… then nothingness._  
“因为我希望他知道——”她正说着，却被突然的强光打断……随后便是一片虚无。

Like a fish quickly pulled out of the water, Rei suddenly bolted upwards on the bed, eyes wide open and she yelled out a monosyllable. The unexpected action startled the women around her bed, as Ritsuko and Natsumi dropped whatever they were holding, clipboards and pens clattering on the floor.  
如同一条被迅速从水中拉出的鱼，丽突然从床上直起身来，双眼大睁，发出一声单音节的喊叫。这突如其来的动作吓坏了围在床边的女人们，律子和夏美手中的东西应声落地，夹板和笔散落一地。

"Rei?" Misato asked loudly as she got up to her feet, rushed to bedside and hugged the girl. "Tell me, what's wrong with you?"  
“丽？”美里大声问道，她站起身来，快步走到床边，紧紧抱住女孩。“告诉我，你怎么了？”

"Please," Rei replied. "I…"  
“请，”丽回答。“我…”

Misato disengaged, letting the girl center herself. "Okay, tell me, but relax yourself."  
美里松开了手，让女孩自己调整状态。“好了，告诉我，但先放松自己。”

Rei took stock of her surroundings, and she wondered why she had these wires taped to her head. "What are… Why I have these?" she asked about the wires.  
绫波审视着四周，不解为何自己头上贴着这些电线。“这些是……为什么我有这些？”她询问关于电线的事。

"Because you were in a trance," Ritsuko answered. "You were really dreaming."  
“因为你当时处于催眠状态，”律子回答，“你真的在做梦。”

"Dreaming?"

All three women around the girl nodded. "That's why we put those electrodes on your head, to see what's on the EEG," Ritsuko explained. "So… tell me what sort of dream you've experienced."  
围在女孩身边的三位女性都点了点头。"那是我们为什么在你的头上放置那些电极，为了看看脑电图上有什么，"律子解释道。"那么……告诉我你经历了什么样的梦。"

"I…" Rei trailed away, trying to pick the right words to describe what she witnessed. "I saw the past life of someone."  
"我……" 绫波犹豫着，试图找到合适的词来描述她所见到的。"我看到了某个人的前世。"

"Of whom?" Misato questioned.  
"是谁？"美里追问道。

"The mother of Ikari. How she lived, and how she became one with Eva."  
碇的母亲。她的生活，以及她如何与 Eva 融为一体。

Astonished, the older women looked at each other in askance, before Misato asked, "Can you explain… uh, describe it?"  
惊讶之下，年长的女性们面面相觑，随后美里问道：“你能解释……呃，描述一下吗？”

Rei nodded, but just as she was about to start, the ER doors swung open, and the three Children who were waiting for almost an hour rushed in. Without hesitating, Shinji quickly hugged Rei and he whispered loudly, "Ayanami, what happened to you? I thought you—"  
绫波点头，但就在她准备开始时，急诊室的门突然打开，等待了近三个小时的三个孩子冲了进来。毫不犹豫地，真嗣迅速拥抱了绫波，并大声耳语道：“绫波，你怎么了？我以为你——”

"Why are you guys doing here?" Misato demanded, as Shinji let go of the First Children. "You were supposed to stay outside, remember?"  
“你们在这里做什么？”美里质问道，同时真嗣放开了第一适格者。“你们应该待在外面的，记得吗？”

"Sorry, but we thought we heard her scream," Asuka said, "which is why we charged in to see what's really going on." The redhead then pulled Shinji for them to sit on one of the spare beds parallel to Rei's bed.  
“抱歉，但我们好像听到了她的尖叫，”明日香说，“所以我们冲进来看看究竟发生了什么。”红发少女随后拉着真嗣，让他们坐在与绫波床铺平行的备用床上。

Kaworu nodded, before turning his attention to Rei. "How are you feeling?" he asked.  
薰点点头，然后将注意力转向绫波。“你感觉如何？”他问道。

"I feel strange," Rei said as the Fifth Children hugged her, rubbing the girl's back as if to reassure her everything was okay.  
"我感觉很奇怪，" 丽说道，第五适格者紧紧抱住她，轻抚着她的背，仿佛在安慰她一切都会好起来。

"You're still fine now," Kaworu said as he let go, but then noticed the electrodes taped to Rei's head. "What's all that over her head?"  
"你现在还好，" 渚薰松开手，但随即注意到丽头上贴着的电极。"她头上那些是什么？"

"We were trying to check her EEG pulses, trying to figure out what caused her to black out," Ritsuko said.  
"我们正在尝试检查她的脑电波脉冲，试图找出导致她昏迷的原因，" 律子解释道。

"I see," Kaworu said as he pulled a stool towards him and he sat on it. "Can I take them off?"  
"我明白了，" 渚薰说着将一把凳子拉到自己面前坐下。"我可以取下它们吗？"

Ritsuko nodded. "Sure," the doctor said. "It's over… for now."  
律子点点头。"当然，" 医生说道。"暂时结束了……"

Gently, one-by-one, Kaworu peeled away the tape holding the electrodes off the girl's head, and then he rubbed her left temple. "Is there some water?" he requested. "I think she's also thirsty."  
渚薰轻柔地逐一剥下贴在女孩头上的电极胶带，然后轻揉她的左太阳穴。"有水吗？" 他请求道。"我想她也渴了。"

"Okay," Natsumi said as she went over to a water dispenser, filled a cup and handed it over to Kaworu, who then thanked her.  
“好的，”夏美说着走到饮水机旁，倒了一杯水递给卡尔，后者向她道谢。

The young man then gave the girl the cup and she drank. Afterwards Kaworu took away the cup, leaned close to the girl and he whispered, "Rei, tell me what visions you have seen."  
年轻人随后将杯子递给女孩，她喝了一口。之后，卡尔拿回杯子，靠近女孩耳边低语：“丽，告诉我你看到了什么幻象。”

Everyone else in the room was now keenly watching, ready to listen to every word.  
房间里的其他人此刻都全神贯注地注视着，准备聆听每一个字。

Rei nodded, then took a deep breath and began to narrate everything she experienced in her 50-minute trance.  
丽点了点头，然后深吸一口气，开始叙述她在 50 分钟恍惚中经历的一切。

Somewhere in Kazakhstan, a convoy consisting of four SUVs was rolling on a dirt road, heading towards a nondescript complex of buildings. The complex was once used to be a part of a Soviet army military installation, supposedly containing facilities to support tank battalions, including a vast training field pocked with wreckage, barracks, an airfield for which to transport tanks with cargo planes, and tank maintenance garages; the last location was this convoy's destination.  
在哈萨克斯坦某处，一支由四辆 SUV 组成的车队正沿着一条土路行驶，朝着一个不起眼的建筑群前进。这个建筑群曾是苏联军队军事设施的一部分，据称包含支持坦克营的设施，包括一个布满残骸的广阔训练场、营房、用于运输坦克的货机的机场以及坦克维修车库；车队的目的地正是这里。

In the lead SUV, the man sitting in the passenger side watched as they were approaching the gatehouse. He was military all the way, including the haircut and bearing, but never his attire: leather jacket and jeans. Upon halting right up there, with the guard leaning down to question the visitors; the guard was packing an AN-104 assault rifle with a collapsible stock, along with four magazines on the belt.  
在领头的 SUV 中，坐在副驾驶座上的男子注视着他们接近门卫室。他从头到脚都是军人的样子，包括发型和举止，但衣着却截然不同：皮夹克和牛仔裤。当他们停在那里，门卫俯身询问来访者时；门卫配备了一把带有折叠枪托的 AN-104 突击步枪，腰带上还挂着四个弹匣。

"You have papers?" the guard asked in Russian. After all this was routine.  
"你有文件吗？" 卫兵用俄语问道。毕竟这是例行公事。

The man lifted a sheaf of printed documents and handed them over to the guard, who then skimmed through until he was satisfied. "That's all?" he replied, except that something wasn't right about the accent.  
那人举起一叠打印好的文件递给卫兵，卫兵随即快速浏览，直到满意为止。"就这些？" 他回答道，但不知为何，那口音有些不对劲。

"No problem," the guard approved, inwardly suspicious, but just as he was about to wave them through, he was surprised to see that the visitor whipped out something else from the folds of his jacket; it was too late for the guard to reach for his rifle.  
"没问题，" 卫兵表面上同意，内心却起了疑心，但正当他准备挥手让他们通过时，他惊讶地看到访客从夹克的褶皱中又掏出了什么东西；此时卫兵伸手去拿步枪已经太迟了。

A silenced Steckhin pistol.  
一把消音的 Steckhin 手枪。

_POOF!_

The guard was now dead, collapsed into a heap with a bloody hole in the forehead. At the same time the convoy rolled in and parked their vehicles right in front of the tank garage, before they stepped out, pop open the tailgate and reached for the arsenal hidden in tarps, consisting entirely of Biz-2 silenced submachine guns.  
守卫已然毙命，额头血洞，瘫倒成一团。与此同时，车队驶入，将车辆停在了坦克车库前，随即下车，打开尾门，伸手去取藏在帆布下的军火，全都是消音的 Biz-2 冲锋枪。

With no word between them, their leader nodded to his subordinates, and led them inside the garage, where there was a flight of stairs leading down. It took them half a minute to reach the very bottom (for the elevator was temporarily out of order), before the team walked down a hallway lit with incandescent bulbs, and the team leader kicked the doors that stood in the way.  
他们之间无言，领队向部下点头示意，便带领他们进入车库，那里有一段通往地下的楼梯。他们花了半分钟到达底部（因电梯临时故障），随后沿着一走廊前行，走廊里挂着白炽灯泡，领队一脚踢开了挡路的门。

Right before them, scientists and technicians gasped in surprise, halted in mid-work, wondering what business these armed men have in this facility. Behind the personnel was a vast Plexiglas tank that was full of LCL... yet devoid of whatever it contained; the rest of the place had workstation cubicles, work tables, and specimen jars full of dead samples floating in preservative.  
就在他们面前，科学家和技术人员惊讶地倒吸一口气，工作戛然而止，疑惑这些武装人员来此设施有何贵干。人员后方是一个巨大的有机玻璃水槽，里面充满了 LCL……却空无一物；其余地方则是工作站隔间、工作台和装满漂浮在防腐剂中的死样本的标本罐。

Out of this crowd, Doctor Steingarten rushed to meet the leader. "What brings you here?" he demanded, but there was a small trace of fear in the old man's voice. "Who are you?"  
人群中，斯坦加滕博士急忙上前迎接领头人。“你们来此有何贵干？”他质问道，但老者的声音中带着一丝恐惧。“你们是谁？”

The leader sighed and briefly scratched his head. "Doctor," he said. "My name is Major Willard Cobb, and may I inform you that the Chairman no longer needs your services, now that the Nagisa Dummy Plug is finished and working perfectly." He then snapped his fingers to the rest of his team, who then raised their weapons and began to mow down anyone standing on two feet.  
领头人叹了口气，轻轻挠了挠头。“博士，”他说道，“我是威尔拉德·科布少校，请允许我告知您，随着渚薰模拟插件的完成并完美运行，主席已不再需要您的服务。”随后他打了个响指，示意他的团队，他们随即举起武器，开始扫射所有站立的人。

Steingarten cowered, not wanting to see this horror unfolding before him as his subordinates screamed and died in that hellstorm of bullets, until there was only the tinkle of empty cartridges on the floor and the last gasps of breath from the dying.  
斯坦加滕蜷缩着，不愿目睹这恐怖的一幕在他眼前展开，他的下属们在弹雨地狱中尖叫着死去，直到只剩下地板上空弹壳的叮当声和垂死者的最后一丝呼吸。

The old man now stood up, but to plead. "Why? What have you done?"  
老人此刻站了起来，却是为了恳求。"为什么？你们做了什么？"

"We're just following orders from the top… But you," Cobb emphasized as he pulled out the silenced pistol again. "Before we burn this place up, you're expendable, old man. Sorry."  
“我们只是遵从上面的命令……但对你，”科布强调着，再次掏出了那把装有消音器的手枪。“在我们烧毁这个地方之前，你是个可以牺牲的老人。抱歉。”

That was the last words Steingarten heard before Cobb's hollowpoint bullet struck the elderly man's head.  
那是斯坦加滕听到的最后一句话，随后科布的空尖弹击中了那位老人的头部。

**AUTHOR'S NOTES:** For more than a month since the last chapter, it's been a struggle for me trying to be productive by writing every late night after all the housework. But, really, to produce this chapter it took a great deal of research and thinking, trying to get as far as I could to see things through Yui Ikari's eyes, like attempting to explore an uncharted region or figuring out the conundrum of that character's puzzle. It's so hard!  
作者笔记：自上次chapter发布以来已有一个多月，我一直在努力通过每晚完成家务后熬夜写作来保持生产力。但实际上，创作这篇chapter需要大量的研究和思考，试图尽可能地从碇唯的视角去看待事物，就像探索未知的领域或解开那个角色谜题一样。太难了！

There are some literary influences found within this chapter, as well as incorporating my recent forays into the concept of reincarnation, or more precisely, transmigration, hence the chapter title. Although there are some references to _Twilight,_ may I remind the fact that this story is an Evafic, and as such I remain loyal to the Eva saga and its memorable characters.  
这篇chapter中融入了一些文学影响，同时也结合了我最近对转世，更确切地说是灵魂迁移概念的探索，因此有了chapter这个标题。虽然文中有些《暮光之城》的引用，但请记住，这是一个 EVA 同人故事，因此我依然忠于 EVA 系列及其令人难忘的角色。

C&Cs are still welcome, and until then, looks like I'm gonna have to return to the jungle, hack my way through, and see how far I could go. Thank you and good evening.  
评论与建议依然欢迎，看来我得重返丛林，披荆斩棘，看看能走多远。感谢阅读，祝您晚安。

"I know that, young woman, but are there any other problems regarding your recovery?"  
"我知道这一点，年轻的小姐，但关于你的康复还有其他问题吗？"

Rei shook her head softly, which Fuyutsuki respectfully took as a gesture that she didn't want more prying questions, for that was Gendo's jurisdiction.  
丽轻轻地摇了摇头，冬月恭敬地理解为她不想再被追问，因为那是源堂的管辖范围。

However, Toji politely cut in.  
然而，冬二礼貌地插话道。

"I'm sorry to interrupt, sir," he said. "But I'm doing better even after. You know what I mean. And what's more, sir, I'm also happy to see that my sister's out of the hospital... She's now staying home back at Tokyo-2."  
"很抱歉打扰您，先生，"他说道，"但即便如此，我感觉自己状态更好了。您明白我的意思。而且，先生，我也很高兴得知我妹妹已经出院了……她现在回到了东京-2 的家中。"

"Good for you, Mister Suzuhara," Fuyutsuki agreed, noting the young man's arm. "I take it as a good fortune to see that you and Shinji are friends once again, and I hope that you'll recover soon from those disabilities. Your medical expenses will be continually taken care of, and we'll hold on to that promise."  
"这很好，铃原先生，"冬月赞同地说，注意到年轻人的手臂。"看到你和真嗣再次成为朋友，我感到非常幸运，希望你能尽快从那些伤残中恢复过来。你的医疗费用将继续得到照顾，我们会坚守这个承诺。"

Toji nodded. "Thank you, sir," he replied.  
东治点点头。"谢谢您，先生，"他回答道。

"But..." Fuyutsuki trailed away. "Regarding Miss Langley," he remarked seriously. "I'm also sorry for what happened to her, and as far as I know..."  
“但是……” 冬月渐渐没了声音。“关于兰利小姐，”他严肃地说道。“我也为她所遭遇的事情感到抱歉，就我所知……”

"She'll be home soon," Misato answered. "We know about that, sir. I am also aware of what happened to Kaji. Fact is, sir... She adored him so much that his... death devastated her."  
"她很快就会回家，" 美里回答道。"我们了解情况，长官。我也知道加治的事情。事实上，长官……她非常爱他，他的……去世对她打击很大。"

Fuyutsuki sighed, somberly remembering the last words Kaji had told him after he was rescued.  
冬月叹了口气，忧郁地回想起加治在被救出后对他说的最后一句话。

_Fuyutsuki blinked. "Oh, it's you," he said as the agent untied the ropes around the elder officer's hands.  
冬月眨了眨眼。“哦，是你啊，”他看着特工解开老长官手上的绳索说道。_

_Kajii smiled. "It's been a while, sir."  
加吉微笑道：“好久不见，长官。”_

_"But..." Fuyutsuki replied as he rose from his chair. "Sooner or later, what you're doing will get you killed... You're a marked man now," he warned.  
“但是……” 副司令从椅子上站起来回答，“迟早，你所做的一切会要了你的命……你现在是个被盯上的人了。”他警告说。_

_However, Kaji shrugged, as if the inevitable was just the part of the job.  
然而，Kaji 耸了耸肩，仿佛不可避免的事情只是工作的一部分。_

_"Sir, I just want to get closer to the truth," Kaji admitted as they walked out of the room. "It's the truth within me. Besides, it seems they're catching on to the fact that I smuggled the Adam sample for Commander Ikari."  
“长官，我只是想接近真相，” 加持承认道，他们走出了房间。“是我内心的真相。而且，他们似乎已经察觉到我为碇司令走私了亚当样本。”_

_"Yes, I know that many people wanted to stop you, but what happens next?" Fuyutsuki questioned, rubbing the reddish-raw skin on his wrists.  
“是的，我知道有很多人想阻止你，但接下来会发生什么？” 冬月问道，揉搓着手腕上红肿破损的皮肤。_

_"If I don't start looking out for myself," Kaji continued, "things could be looking grim for me."  
“如果我不开始为自己打算，”加持继续说，“我的处境可能会变得很糟糕。”_

As if to pay due respect to the poor girl and the now-gone secret agent, there was a moment of solemn silence over their table, amid the chatter around them. With the exception of Kaworu and Rei, the other diners had their own thoughts and recollections about Asuka and Kaji.  
仿佛是为了向那位可怜的女孩和现已消失的间谍表示应有的敬意，他们的桌子周围在周围的嘈杂声中出现了一刻肃穆的沉默。除了渚薰和绫波之外，其他食客各自心中都有着对明日香和加持的思绪和回忆。

But out of a wish, Shinji broke that silence. "I wanted to see her awake once more," he whispered. "Because..."  
但出于一个愿望，真嗣打破了那片沉默。“我想再见她醒来的样子。”他低声说道，“因为……”

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Come again?"  
冬月眨了眨眼。“再说一遍？”

"Because, sir..." Shinji admitted, "I would like to talk to Asuka, just to settle our differences... There's not a night where I'm not worried about her, even if she..." He stopped abruptly, almost saying "she hates everyone".  
"“因为，老师……”真嗣坦白道，“我想和明日香谈谈，只是为了化解我们的分歧……没有一夜我不为她担忧，即使她……”他突然停住，差点说出“她讨厌所有人”。

However, Fuyutsuki knew that there was considerable disagreement between those two Children especially that Asuka was more adamant in fruitlessly pursuing her goal to be the best... even if that effort had almost cost her life.  
然而，冬月知道这两位孩子之间存在着相当大的分歧，尤其是明日香更加固执地追求成为最好的目标，即便这种努力几乎让她付出了生命的代价。

"Don't worry about that, young man," Fuyutsuki replied, to inject self-faith and hope in Shinji's heart. "I know what you feel about Asuka, and I also believe that she'll recover quickly."  
“年轻人，别担心，”冬月回答道，试图在真嗣心中注入自信和希望。“我了解你对明日香的感情，我也相信她会很快康复。”

Shinji nodded. "Thank you, sir... I'll keep that hope in mind."  
真嗣点点头。“谢谢您，先生……我会牢记这份希望。”

"That's better," Fuyutsuki answered, as he watched Toji pat Shinji on the shoulder.  
"这样好多了," 冬月回答道，他看着真治拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。

Seeing that everything has been settled with, Fuyutsuki rose from his seat. "Well," he spoke, "On a good note, I guess that concludes our lunch, so I would like to thank you for allowing me to join in and share your thoughts."  
看到一切都已安排妥当，冬月从座位上站起身来。“好吧，”他说道，“算是个好消息吧，我想我们的午餐就这样结束了，感谢你们让我加入并分享你们的想法。”

"Thank you, sir," Misato politely agreed as she and the Children stood up together. "It's a great honor to have your presence."  
“谢谢您，先生，”美里礼貌地回应，她和孩子们一起站了起来。“您的到来是我们的荣幸。”

"My pleasure, Major," Fuyutsuki responded as he nodded. "I'll see you all tomorrow."  
“我的荣幸，美里少校，”冬月点头回应。“明天见。”

By unspoken agreement, they let Fuyutsuki leave, watching him walk away before they turned their attention to themselves, preparing to depart.  
他们默契地让冬月离开，目送他走远后才将注意力转向自己，准备启程。

"I hope that all of you three will have a good journey," Kaworu remarked as he straightened out, while Rei silently put her seat back into its place.  
“希望你们三位旅途愉快，”渚薰说着挺直了身子，而绫波丽则默默地将座椅恢复原位。

Misato nodded. "Thanks," she answered. "Have a great time at the pool, you two."  
美里点头道：“谢谢。”她回答，“你们俩去泳池玩得开心。”

Kaworu politely nodded, before he gestured Rei to leave their seats, and let her lead the way.  
渚薰礼貌地点了点头，示意绫波离开座位，让她带路。

But just as the two other Children took another step, Rei looked back at Shinji and their eyes met for a second. The young man's deep-blue eyes seemed to ask for something.  
但就在另外两个孩子再迈出一步时，绫波回头看向真嗣，两人的目光短暂交汇。少年深蓝色的眼眸似乎在寻求着什么。

Kaworu blinked and hesitated. "What's the problem?" he asked the hesitating girl, before he saw her staring at the other boy.  
渚薰眨了眨眼，犹豫了一下。“有什么问题吗？”他问着犹豫的女孩，随后注意到她正盯着另一个男孩。

"A... Ayanami," Shinji spoke uneasily, trying to overcome his nervousness while Toji looked at his two classmates. Even Misato paused, halfway in picking up her purse.  
"绫...绫波," 真嗣不安地说道，试图克服自己的紧张情绪，而东治则看着他的两个同学。就连美里也停了下来，正准备拿起她的钱包。

"Pardon me?" the girl replied.  
"你说什么？" 女孩回答道。

Shinji smiled softly. "Thanks for joining with us for lunch," he replied. "I'll see you again..."  
真嗣温柔地笑了笑。"谢谢你和我们一起吃午饭，" 他回答说，"我们还会再见面的..."

Kaworu and Rei nodded, but only the Fifth Children responded with a smile. "Okay, my friend. Just remember my advice and put it to good use."  
渚薰和绫波点了点头，但只有第五适格者回以微笑。“好的，我的朋友。记得我的建议，好好利用它。”

Toji grinned. "Yeah, he should do so," he said, patting his remaining hand on Shinji's shoulder. "And do you know what, Kaworu?"  
真嗣咧嘴一笑。“是啊，他应该这么做，”他说着，用剩下的手拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。“你知道吗，渚薰？”

"Is it something good?" Kaworu asked.  
“是好事吗？”渚薰问道。

"Yeah, you sound really cool in my book. You're going with the flow," Toji remarked cheerfully. "I'd hope you'll hang out with us again pretty soon once things here get back to normal."  
“是啊，你在我看来真的很酷。随波逐流嘛，”冬二愉快地评论道，“希望这里恢复正常后，你能很快再和我们一起玩。”

Kaworu nodded. "Yes," he agreed. "Thank you for your friendly offer, Suzuhara."  
渚薰点头。“是的，”他同意道，“谢谢你的友好邀请，铃原。”

Still grinning, Toji gave him a victory sign. "Right on!" he replied loudly while Shinji nodded.  
冬二依旧笑着，向他比了个胜利的手势。“太棒了！”他大声回应，而真嗣也点头表示同意。

"Let's go, boys," Misato said, before she turned her attention at the pair. "I'll see you two tomorrow. Is that clear?"  
"我们走吧，小伙子们," 美里说道，然后转向那对搭档。"明天见你们两个。清楚了吗？"

Kaworu and Rei nodded in unison. "Yes, ma'am," they answered. Shinji waved his hand in return while Toji winked, before they walked away.  
薰和丽同步点头。"是的，女士," 他们回答。真嗣挥手回应，而真治眨了眨眼，然后他们一起离开了。

---

Once they were left alone, Kaworu and Rei walked to one of the elevators outside the cafeteria and he pressed the button for the elevator to go down.  
一旦他们独处，薰和绫波便走向食堂外的一部电梯，他按下按钮让电梯下行。

While they waited, Kaworu asked. "We're going to my room to pick up my swimming trunks, and... Did the Commander really...?"  
"在他们等待的时候，渚薰问道。“我们要去我房间拿我的泳裤，还有……司令真的……？””

Rei turned to him and answered. "Yes, as I have earlier mentioned, he has given me orders to socialize with you, Nagisa."  
"绫波零转向他并回答。“是的，正如我之前提到的，他命令我和你社交，渚。””

Kaworu smiled. "I should be very thankful," he remarked, feeling relieved. "I thought he was very strict with you when it comes to making friends."  
"渚薰微笑着。“我应该非常感激，”他松了口气地说，“我以为他在交友方面对你非常严格。””

Rei didn't return a reply, and soon the elevator doors opened, the two walked inside in unison.  
丽没有回应，很快电梯门打开了，两人同步走了进去。

As the elevator lurched downwards, Kaworu asked the girl carefully. "Pardon me, but was there anything wrong with what I said?"  
电梯缓缓下降时，薰小心翼翼地问女孩：“对不起，我刚才说的话有什么不妥吗？”

Rei shook her head softly. "No, but the Commander always insists that everyone must follow his orders."  
丽轻轻摇了摇头。“没有，但司令总是坚持每个人都必须遵守他的命令。”

Kaworu blinked. "Including you and me?"  
渚薰眨了眨眼。“包括你和我？”

"Yes," Rei confirmed, "even if there are any objections from us."  
“是的，”绫波零确认道，“即使我们中有任何异议。”

At the same time, in his vast, Sephirotic-styled office, Gendo Ikari could only think after he finally finished reading the stack of reports sitting on his desk. As he pondered, he felt confident that he would get to execute his version of the Plan before the Committee could implement theirs.  
与此同时，在他那宽敞、风格类似萨菲罗特的办公室里，碇源堂终于读完了桌上的一摞报告。在沉思中，他自信能在委员会实施他们的计划之前执行自己的版本。

It was a matter of perfect mathematical timing, with every piece falling into the right place, and nothing in this world would stop him, not even the all-powerful SEELE.  
这一切都是完美的数学时机，每个环节都恰到好处，在这个世界上没有任何事物能阻止他，即便是无所不能的 SEELE 也不例外。

While he believed himself to be a man of infinite patience, Gendo already knew that the appointed day was coming, for the Committee has shown anxiety through their voices despite the huge black monoliths surrounding him.  
尽管他认为自己是个极有耐心的人，源度已经知道那个指定的日子即将到来，因为委员会的声音中透露出了焦虑，尽管他周围环绕着巨大的黑色巨石。

_Though my time is running out, I will show those unbelievers what wonders I can still make,_ he told himself, thinking of the scheming German who pestered him for the Plan's completion. _Two can play this game, and I will be one step ahead even as they throw everything at me._  
虽然我的时间不多了，我会向那些不相信的人展示我还能创造的奇迹，他对自己说，想起了那个不断催促他完成计划的狡猾德国人。两人可以玩这个游戏，即使他们对我倾尽全力，我也会领先一步。

The bearded Commander smirked before he glanced at his watch, and realizing that it was time to eat, stood up from his seat and buttoned up his black coat.  
留着胡须的指挥官微微一笑，然后瞥了一眼手表，意识到是时候吃饭了，便从座位上站起来，扣上了他的黑色外套。

Walking away from the desk and adjusting his amber eyeglasses, even the most Machiavellian of leaders deserved to eat their lunch, as Gendo recalled a remote vision from the past, of dear Yui handing him a rich bento box of tuna sashimi and rice.  
离开办公桌，调整着琥珀色的眼镜，即便是最高明的权谋者也该享用午餐，源堂回想起过去遥远的一幕，亲爱的唯递给他一个装满金枪鱼刺身和米饭的丰盛便当盒。

### Chapter 33 Afterwards

**SEELE Covert Forward Operations Base  
SEELE 秘密前线行动基地  
Siberia, Russia**

In his private quarters, sitting on an armchair before a lit fireplace, Keel Lorenz was sipping on a cup of tea, when he heard the knocking on the door.  
在他的私人房间里，坐在一把扶手椅上，面前是燃着火的壁炉，基尔·洛伦兹正啜饮着一杯茶，这时他听到了敲门声。

"Come inside," Keel intoned, and the door opened, and an old man walked in. This visitor's hair and very lengthy beard were all white; he was dressed in a three-piece suit; his face was weathered with deep creases and dark spots, but his grey eyes remained alert and intelligent, and despite his advanced age his 6-foot body retained the muscular build that once earned him the sobriquets "The Bear" and "The Crocodile" (for effortlessly snapping the necks of his captives with the strength of a crocodile's hard bite). The ring finger on his left hand had one made of solid gold and inscribed with the emblem of the KGB, the once-feared security apparatus of the Soviet Union.  
“进来吧，”基尔用低沉的声音说道，门随即打开，一位老人走了进来。这位访客的头发和长长的胡须全白了；他穿着三件套西装；脸上布满深深的皱纹和黑斑，但灰色的眼睛依然机警而聪慧，尽管年事已高，他那六英尺高的身躯仍保持着曾经为他赢得“熊”和“鳄鱼”绰号的肌肉身材（因为他能像鳄鱼一样毫不费力地扭断俘虏的脖子）。他左手无名指上戴着一枚纯金戒指，上面刻有克格勃的徽章，这个曾经令人闻风丧胆的苏联安全机构。

Keel looked up and smiled. "What brings you here, Brother Evgenyi?"  
基尔抬起头，微笑着。“什么风把你吹来了，叶夫根尼兄弟？”

Evgenyi Yusupovich Starayakov, otherwise known as SEELE 04, walked over to a tea service cart, and picked up a china cup. "Just to unwind, my old friend," he answered. The otherwise elderly man was formerly the second-in-command of the KGB in the Gorbachev era, and currently the honorary president of Russia's largest oil company.  
叶夫根尼·尤苏波维奇·斯塔拉亚科夫，也就是 SEELE 04，走向茶水车，拿起一个瓷杯。“只是来放松一下，老朋友，”他回答道。这位原本年迈的男子曾是戈尔巴乔夫时代克格勃的二把手，如今是俄罗斯最大石油公司的名誉主席。

"Ah," Keel grunted. "It's been years since I first came across your father, and I'm very grateful for his kindness."  
“啊，”基尔咕哝道，“自从我第一次见到你父亲以来，已经过去很多年了，我非常感激他的善意。”

Evgenyi grinned as he prepared a cup of Earl Grey. He'd heard the same story from his old friend from time to time, and remembered it so well: Keel was made a prisoner of war after the Russians conquered Berlin and captured scores of defeated Hitler Youth conscripts, and the victors figured that they had absolute god-like power to decide the fates of their captives: either to send them to Siberia, knead them to compliance into communists, or kill them. But somehow Evgenyi's father recognized Keel, heard from him that he had a back problem, and using his authority as a senior NKVD official, the elder Starayakov freed the young man and let him walk over to the American lines as a hungry refugee wearing ragged civilian clothes. The reason for this gesture of kindness was that Evgenyi's old man was a friend of Keel's father, and both of them happen to have studied together in the University of Berlin, prior to Hitler's rise to power.  
叶甫根尼一边准备着一杯伯爵茶，一边咧嘴笑了。他时不时从老友那里听到这个故事，记忆犹新：基尔在俄国人攻克柏林并俘获大批战败的希特勒青年团成员后成了战俘，胜利者们自认为拥有绝对的神一般的力量来决定俘虏们的命运：要么送往西伯利亚，要么将其改造为共产主义者，要么干脆处决。但不知怎的，叶甫根尼的父亲认出了基尔，得知他背部有伤，便利用自己作为高级内务人民委员部官员的职权，释放了这位年轻人，让他身着破旧的平民服装，以饥饿难民的身份走向美军防线。这一善举的原因在于，叶甫根尼的父亲与基尔的父亲是朋友，两人在希特勒上台前曾在柏林大学共同求学。

Since his freedom Keel had prospered, created and operated a veritable business empire out of a long-suffering pharmaceutical company, and at the same time secretly led and rebuilt SEELE into what it was today: an invisible fraternity of absolute power answerable only to itself.  
自从获得自由以来，基尔一直繁荣发展，将一家饱受折磨的制药公司打造成了一个真正的商业帝国，同时秘密领导并重建了 SEELE，使其成为今天这样：一个只对自己负责的绝对权力隐形兄弟会。

Of course Keel generously repaid the elder Starayakov, with the German's covert contributions to the Soviet's chemical and biological warfare programs during the Cold War. Had not for Keel's support, along with Western intelligence leakages the German had passed on to the intelligence agency through cutouts and triple agents, Evgenyi might have not survived the vicious climb right up to the top of the KGB hierarchy, which was why the old Russian was now in good health and spirits, lived long enough beyond his cut-throat life in the intelligence agency, and looked forward to Instrumentality.  
当然，基尔慷慨地回报了老斯塔拉亚科夫，这位德国人在冷战期间对苏联化学和生物战争项目的秘密贡献。如果不是基尔的支持，加上德国人通过中间人和三重间谍传递给情报机构的西方情报泄露，叶甫根尼可能无法在克格勃的残酷攀爬中幸存下来，这也是为什么这位老俄罗斯人现在身体健康、精神矍铄，活过了他在情报机构的残酷生活，并期待着人类补完计划。

"Always," Evgenyi said as he picked up a bottle of premium Stolichnaya, uncorked it and poured a shotful of the popular vodka into his steaming cup. To keep himself warm, he reasoned. He then noted that on the small table besides Keel's chair there was a telephone. "Whose call are you waiting for?"  
“总是，”叶甫根尼说着拿起一瓶高级的苏联红牌伏特加，拔开瓶塞，将一杯这种受欢迎的伏特加倒入他冒着热气的杯中。为了保暖，他这样解释。然后他注意到基尔椅子旁边的小桌子上有一部电话。“你在等谁的电话？”

"I've sent Herr Cobb to put Steingarten to sleep and destroy the facility," Keel answered, referring to the liquidation mission in Kazakhstan. "Loose ends that we must deal with."  
"我已经派科布先生去让斯坦加滕沉睡并摧毁设施，"基尔回答道，指的是在哈萨克斯坦的清算任务。"我们必须处理的松散末端。"

"Oh," Evgenyi blurted. "The man who made our Dummy Plugs, right?"  
"哦，"叶甫根尼脱口而出。"就是制作我们假插头的那个男人，对吧？"

"He and his men were expendable, so it was for the sake of security, to make sure we keep Ikari in the dark."  
"他和他的手下是可以牺牲的，所以这是为了安全起见，确保我们让碇一直蒙在鼓里。"

Evgenyi raised his cup in approval. "Excellent, as always," he answered before taking a sip. "Leaving no stone unturned… But, what about Sanderson and Nagisa?"  
叶夫根尼举杯表示赞同。“一如既往的出色，”他回答后抿了一口。“不遗余力……但，桑德森和渚那边呢？”

"They'll report in soon enough," Keel answered. "It's only with that Angel that I am much concerned about."  
“他们很快就会汇报的，”基尔回答。“只有那只天使让我颇为担忧。”

"Why?" the old Russian asked before smacking his lips; he got the tea mixture all right.  
“为何？”老俄罗斯人问道，随即咂了咂嘴；他的茶调得恰到好处。

"The one thing about that young man is his insatiable curiosity, and that indeed sets him apart from his other brethren. Once he sees something new, he would relentlessly study it, ask questions, or try it for himself, which is why he's very good at most things and he learns so quickly."  
“那个年轻人身上有一股无法满足的好奇心，这确实让他与众不同。一旦他看到新鲜事物，就会不遗余力地研究、提问，甚至亲自尝试，这也是他学什么都快、做什么都出色的原因。”

"But then…?"

"The problem is the amount of loyalty he has right now. He must draw a fine line between us and NERV, but if he doesn't sees things in our way and he doesn't do what he is supposed to follow, and as I have said before, his life will be forfeit."  
“问题在于他现在的忠诚度。他必须在对我们和 NERV 之间划清界限，但如果他不能站在我们这边，不按要求行事，正如我之前所说，他的生命将岌岌可危。”

The phone suddenly rang, interrupting both men, and Keel picked it up.  
电话突然响起，打断了两人对话，基尔接起了电话。

"Yes?" the old German answered.  
"什么事？" 那位年迈的德国人回答道。

"It's Cobb, Chairman," the American from the other end of the line said, talking in a Southern accent. "Targets eliminated, and right now we're returning."  
"是科布，主席，" 电话另一端的那位美国人操着南方口音说道，"目标已清除，我们现在正在返回。"

Keel smiled. "Excellent," he praised. "However, as soon as you and your men arrive, Quaritch has another job for you."  
基尔笑了。"很好，"他称赞道，"不过，你们一回来，夸里奇就有另一项任务给你们。"

"Thank you, Chairman. That'll be mighty fine," Cobb replied.  
"谢谢您，主席。那真是太好了，"科布回答道。

"Good," Keel concluded before putting down the phone.  
"好的，"基尔总结道，随后挂断了电话。

"So, is it done?" Evgenyi asked.  
"那么，事情办妥了吗？"叶甫根尼问道。

Keel nodded. "Yes, and then we'll wait for the finishing touches."  
基尔点了点头。“是的，然后我们就等待最后的润色。”

"The day after tomorrow," the Russian agreed, before making another sip of his spiked tea.  
“后天，”俄罗斯人同意道，随即又啜了一口加了料的茶。

When it was over, they couldn't just believe what Rei said, and her audience can only blink twice, as if to make sure they heard correctly.  
当一切结束时，他们无法相信丽所说的话，她的听众只能眨两次眼，仿佛要确认自己是否听对了。

"That's all?" Shinji questioned.  
"就这些？" 真嗣问道。

"Yes," Rei answered. "是的，" 绫回答。

"How… How did you manage to remember everything about Mom?"  
"你是怎么……怎么记得关于妈妈的一切的？"

"I do not understand, but perhaps because of the compatibility test," she said, referring to the earlier failed compatibility test, in which Unit-01 rejected Rei completely, yet at the same time restored the memory of her past back into her brain.  
"我不明白，但或许是因为兼容性测试，"她解释道，指的是之前失败的兼容性测试，其中零号机完全排斥绫波，同时却又将她过去的记忆恢复到了她的大脑中。

"All right," Ritsuko said. "Let's get it clear as to how she managed to have all of it in her head."  
"好吧，"律子说，"让我们弄清楚她是如何将这一切记忆在脑海中的。"

"How?" Shinji and Asuka asked in unison.  
"怎么回事？"真嗣和明日香异口同声地问道。

"I'm all ears," Kaworu said.  
"我洗耳恭听," 渚薰说道。

"It hinges on the fact that Unit One is responsible for returning most of Rei's past memory while it went out of control, and—"  
"关键在于初号机失控时负责恢复绫波大部分过去的记忆，而且——"

"Eva has her own mind and soul," Rei interjected.  
"Eva 有自己的思想和灵魂," 绫波插话道。

"That's right," Ritsuko acknowledged, "and with that fact in mind, it's possible that Evas can also store memories, drawing them from whoever occupies the Entry Plugs. Now, in this case, Shinji, your mother was absorbed into Unit-01 at 400% synchronization, causing her soul to be merged with the core, and therefore that Eva also acquired her memory. Fast forward to a decade later, with Rei asked to synchronize with Unit-01, but then things turned ugly and caused that Eva to force all of what she knew into Rei."  
"没错，" 赤木律子承认道，"考虑到这一点，Eva 也可能存储记忆，从任何进入插入栓的人那里提取。现在，在这种情况下，真嗣，你的母亲在 400%同步率下被吸收进初号机，导致她的灵魂与核心融合，因此那台 Eva 也获得了她的记忆。快进到十年后，绫波被要求与初号机同步，但随后情况变得糟糕，导致那台 Eva 将她所知道的一切强行灌输给了绫波。"

"Which is why I can remember not just my past," Rei said, staring at Shinji with her cerise eyes, "but that of your mother."  
"这就是为什么我不只记得自己的过去，" 绫波说道，用她那深红色的眼睛凝视着真嗣，"还有你母亲的记忆。"

Shinji nodded as he blinked twice. "I see… That made sense. But I want to ask something else, Ayanami."  
真嗣点了点头，眨了两下眼睛。"我明白了……这说得通。但我还想问你一件事，绫波。"

"What is it?" Rei questioned.  
"这是什么？" 丽问道。

The young man sighed. "Did Mom really loved Father?"  
年轻人叹了口气。"妈妈真的爱爸爸吗？"

Rei mulled over the question for a minute, and then she replied, "I do not know if it is genuine, or it was out of necessity… But the Commander was truly in love and at the same time, through her association with the Elders, it allowed him immense influence over the Committee."  
丽沉思了一会儿，然后回答道："我不知道这是出于真心，还是出于必要……但指挥官确实深爱着她，同时，通过与长老们的联系，他在委员会中获得了巨大的影响力。"

Shinji frowned. "No wonder he's crazy about this Instrumentality thing," he bitterly remarked, shaking his head. "No wonder why he misuses anyone close to him."  
真嗣皱起眉头。“难怪他对这个人类补完计划如此痴迷，”他苦涩地评论道，摇了摇头。“难怪他会滥用任何亲近他的人。”

"All for the sake of your mother?" Kaworu asked.  
“全都是为了你的母亲？”渚薰问道。

"Yeah," Shinji answered. "But… He's doing it all so wrong. Now, I don't quite understand why Mom decided to get along with those crazy old men… Those trying to play God."  
“嗯，”真嗣回答。“但是……他做得完全错了。现在，我不太明白为什么妈妈会选择和那些疯狂的老头们相处……那些试图扮演上帝的人。”

"She did it for your own sake," Rei said.  
"她这么做是为了你好，" 丽说道。

Shinji scratched his head. "Me?"  
真嗣挠了挠头。"我？"

Rei nodded. "That is right. She joined out of the reason that she wanted to set things right. She did not wish Eva to be made as a tool for theirs to exploit, but she paid the price and they marked her for death. Therefore it became her decision to be one with Eva."  
丽点了点头。"没错。她加入是因为她想纠正错误。她不希望 Eva 被他们当作利用的工具，但她为此付出了代价，他们将她标记为必死之人。因此，她决定与 Eva 合为一体。

"Really?"

"Yes," Rei confirmed. “是的，”丽确认道。

Shinji shook his head. "Now that explains why sometimes I feel she's with me right in there. But what's the point of her doing all this for me? Why the need to sacrifice herself?"  
真嗣摇了摇头。“现在这解释了为什么有时我觉得她就在我身边。但她为什么要为我做这一切？为什么要牺牲自己？”

Except for Rei, everyone else around him felt uncomfortable, as if they couldn't give a definite answer.  
除了丽，周围的其他人都感到不安，仿佛无法给出一个明确的答案。

And she spoke: "Even if everything else has long gone, long after eons, Eva will exist as long as that one person lives on… and she shall exist as proof of humanity's existence."  
她开口说道：“即便万物皆已逝去，历经无数岁月，只要那一人尚存，伊娃便将永存……她将成为人类存在的证明。”

"You mean…" Shinji trailed off.  
“你是说……” 真嗣话音渐弱。

Misato blinked, for she heard that already from Fuyutsuki. "That's what the Sub-Commander told me last night," she said.  
美里眨了眨眼，因为她已经从副司令那里听过这番话。“这是昨晚副司令告诉我的，”她说道。

"How?" the young man asked.  
"怎么做到的？" 年轻人问道。

"As he once used to work with her," Misato said, "he explained what your mom intended to do, and just as Rei said, she merged with Eva to fulfill her plan."  
"因为他曾经和她共事过，" 美里说，"他解释了你妈妈打算做什么，正如丽所说的，她与 Eva 融合以完成她的计划。"

"Oh, reminds me of the archived stuff that were loaded onto the Voyager probes," Ritsuko said. "They did just that so that when some intelligent life comes across them, those probes will remind them that we exist in the universe."  
"哦，这让我想起了装载在旅行者探测器上的那些档案资料，" 律子说。"他们正是这样做的，以便当某些智慧生命发现它们时，这些探测器会提醒他们我们在宇宙中的存在。"

"But that is what the Committee did not want," Rei said. "They preferred to carry out their own plan of remaking existence to their own wishes, to obtain the immortality of gods."  
“但那正是委员会所不希望的，”丽说道，“他们更倾向于按照自己的意愿重塑存在，以获得神一般的永生。”

Misato nodded. "Which is why we are making plans to prepare for that eventuality should we refuse to do as they say."  
美里点头道：“这也是为什么我们正在制定计划，以防万一我们拒绝按照他们的要求行事。”

"Yeah," Shinji said.

For a while, silence settled among them, letting all the facts sink in as they pondered. The consequence was that with Rei having full knowledge of both about her personal life and that of Shinji's mother, the more she would speak of them, the more she would shed light to murky mysteries that were responsible for what was happening in the present. Perhaps with this knowledge, they might as well be able to stop the final catastrophe from happening.  
一时间，他们陷入了沉默，让所有的事实沉淀下来，深思熟虑。由于丽对她的个人生活以及真嗣母亲的情况了如指掌，她谈论得越多，就越能揭开那些导致当前局势的迷雾。或许有了这些知识，他们就能阻止最终灾难的发生。

But for now, as long as Commander Ikari has full control of the organization, until a favorable opportunity presents itself, they cannot make any drastic moves and instead must move things in the background and in secret.  
但目前，只要碇司令完全掌控组织，在没有有利时机出现之前，他们无法采取任何激烈行动，而只能在幕后秘密行事。

In Misato's mind, she was sure that Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki was pulling strings by convincing the other key NERV officials the truth of Ikari's machinations and what would happen if they do not intervene. Perhaps by now he should have succeeded with his own brand of diplomacy, as she knew that most people working here secretly disliked the Commander's rather cold and autocratic leadership style, and wanting changes to happen; in the grapevine personnel felt better working under Fuyutsuki's watch, as he did not terrorize his subordinates for even the smallest infractions.  
在美里心中，她确信副司令冬月正在通过说服其他 NERV 关键官员，揭示碇的阴谋及其不干预的后果，从而暗中操纵局势。或许到目前为止，他应该已经凭借自己的外交手腕取得了成功，因为她知道这里的大多数人私下里都不喜欢司令那种冷漠且独裁的领导风格，渴望有所改变；在员工之间流传的说法中，人们觉得在冬月的领导下工作更为舒适，因为他不会因为最小的过失而恐吓下属。

Going back, Misato guessed that if Rei told Shinji more of about his mother and her life's work, she hoped that the truth would make him a better person than he was before.  
回想起来，美里猜测如果丽向真嗣透露更多关于他母亲及其生平工作的信息，她希望真相能使他变得比以前更好。

"All right," Misato said, breaking the impasse as she glanced at the wall clock, which told them it was 5:16 in the afternoon, "Why don't you Children take a break from all of this dreary stuff for a while, let us grown-ups to deal with it, and then focus on tonight's get-together at the O-Club? All four of you still need to get your spirits up."  
“好吧，”美里打破了僵局，她瞥了一眼墙上的时钟，显示现在是下午 5 点 16 分，“你们这些孩子们为什么不暂时放下这些沉闷的事情，让我们大人来处理，然后专注于今晚在 O 俱乐部的小聚会呢？你们四个还需要振作精神。”

Well, it was obvious to the three women that the Children had taken things too seriously.  
嗯，对这三位女性来说，很明显孩子们把事情看得太严重了。

Asuka nodded. "Why not?" she said, suddenly feeling perky.  
明日香点头。“为什么不呢？”她突然感到精神振奋。

"Besides," Ritsuko said amusedly, looking at Rei, "I'd like to see how it would look like if you let your hair down."  
"再说了，" 赤木律子饶有兴致地看着绫波，"我想看看你放下头发会是什么样子。"

Rei blinked. "What is 'hair down'?"  
绫波眨了眨眼。"什么是'放下头发'？"

Asuka laughed and then she replied, "Oh, my… It means you can behave like as if you're more relaxed than the usual."  
明日香笑了，然后回答道，"哦，天哪……意思是你可以表现得比平时更放松。"

Bemused, Shinji shook his head.  
困惑不解的，真嗣摇了摇头。

The First Children nodded. "I see, it is an idiom," she said, but noticed Shinji's body language. "Ikari… _my brother_, I am sorry if I do not understand… idioms."  
第一适格者点了点头。“我明白了，这是个成语，”她说，但注意到了真嗣的身体语言。“碇……我的兄弟，如果我不理解……成语，我很抱歉。”

Shinji caught on Rei's use of the words _my brother,_ causing him to blink. "Wait a minute," he said. "What did you say?"  
真嗣注意到绫波用了“我的兄弟”这个词，让他眨了眨眼。“等一下，”他说。“你刚才说什么？”

"Idioms," Rei answered. “成语，”丽回答道。

Shinji shook his head. "No, Ayanami, I mean… you said 'my brother'. I never heard you say that before."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不，绫波，我是说……你刚才用了‘我的哥哥’。我以前从未听你这么说过。”

Instead, Rei simply blushed and smiled, and Kaworu said, "Well, I think she'll be sticking to it from now on."  
相反，绫波只是脸颊微红，微笑着，而薰则说：“嗯，我想从今往后她会一直这么称呼了。”

Anyhow, the idea of Rei calling him _my brother_ made his heart so tender that he walked up to the First Children and hugged her. That surprised her much as Shinji whispered, "Thanks… I never had a _sister_ like you."  
无论如何，丽称他为‘我的哥哥’这个念头让他的心变得异常柔软，他走向第一适格者并拥抱了她。这让丽非常惊讶，因为真嗣低声说道：“谢谢……我从没有像你这样的妹妹。”

"It is all right," Rei replied as Shinji, now her brother by consanguinity and genetics, slowly let go of her. "You were also correct in saying that I act like a mother," she added.  
“没关系，”丽回答道，真嗣现在既是她的血亲也是基因上的兄弟，慢慢地放开了她。“你之前说我对你的态度像母亲一样，这也是对的，”她补充道。

"I forgot, but what did I said?"  
“我忘了，但我之前说了什么？”

"Do you not remember, when you said that I was like a mother in the way that I wiped the floor?" she recalled, her thoughts reaching back to that afternoon, when Shinji saw her on all fours, cleaning the floor with a wet rag.  
"你不记得了吗，你曾说我像母亲一样擦地板？" 她回忆道，思绪飘回到那个下午，真嗣看到她四肢着地，用湿抹布清洁地板的情景。

Shinji blinked. "Oh… Yeah, that's right. Now I can remember that," he said, before breaking into a chuckle.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。"哦…对，没错。现在我想起来了，"他说着，忍不住笑了起来。

"However, the other wish of Mother was to look after you," Rei answered. "In the same way I tried to protect you."  
"然而，母亲另一个愿望是照顾你，" 绫波回答。"就像我曾试图保护你那样。

Shinji blinked. "Oh, that's why she moved her arm on the first day I came, right?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“哦，这就是为什么我来的第一天她动了她的手臂，对吧？”

Rei nodded. "I remember that moment. You saw me hurt and tried to comfort me."  
绫波点了点头。“我记得那一刻。你看到我受伤，试图安慰我。”

"Yet now I understand why he had you carted right at the cages: to force me to pilot." Shinji then sighed, knowing all too well that his father went to great lengths to misuse people for his own ends.  
“然而现在我明白了，为什么他让你直接送到笼子里：是为了逼我驾驶。”真嗣叹了口气，深知他的父亲为了自己的目的不惜滥用他人。

"Unfortunately, that was correct," Rei confirmed. "He wanted you to pilot Unit One."  
"不幸的是，这是正确的，" 丽确认道。"他希望你来驾驶初号机。"

"That's right… But, can I say something else?" Shinji suggested.  
"没错……不过，我能说点别的吗？" 真嗣提议道。"

"You may," Rei said.  
"你可以，" 丽说。"

Shinji turned his attention to his other companions and he began, "I had a strange feeling when… How can I say it? I… You see, what I feel for Ayanami, it doesn't go with words...like 'like' and 'want to go out with.'" He then repeatedly patted his hand over heart. "It's as if she's a part of me that was torn away a long time ago."  
真嗣转向他的其他同伴，开始说道：“我有一种奇怪的感觉，当……我该怎么说呢？我……你看，我对绫波的感情，不是‘喜欢’和‘想和她交往’这样的词能表达的……”他随后反复用手拍打着心口。“就好像她是我很久以前就被撕裂的一部分。”

"But now…" Kaworu interjected.  
“但现在……”薰插话道。

"I feel complete," Shinji said, and he smiled as if things have finally gone full circle and made sense after a very long time of being befuddled with puzzles.  
“我感觉完整了，”真嗣说，他微笑着，仿佛事情终于圆满了，经过长时间的困惑和解谜，终于变得清晰明了。

Kaworu shrugged, feeling thankful. "All's well ends well," he declared.  
渚耸了耸肩，感到庆幸。“结局好就一切都好，”他宣布道。

At the Secure Weapons Storage Facility, six levels below the ground, Tsutomo Kanzaki hefted an assault rifle from one of the olive-drab steel cases, having wiped it free of Cosmoline, a protective paste that kept weapons from corrosion while in storage. The weapon, with only a metal placeholder in the magazine well for the sake of safety, was a 5.56mm Heckler and Koch G-36C, designed for special operations. For that role, the designers added Picatinny rails on top of the weapon and on the handguard sides and bottom, to allow any scopes and accessories to be attached quickly; the shorter barrel length made it good for close-quarter battle, especially in tight places such as NERV HQ; even more importantly, this family of assault rifles can be quickly customized to any configuration with just a few tools.  
在地下六层的武器安全存储设施中，Tsutomo Kanzaki 从其中一个橄榄绿钢箱中拿起一把突击步枪，已经将其上的 Cosmoline——一种在储存期间防止武器腐蚀的保护性润滑脂——擦拭干净。这把武器的弹匣井里只有一个金属占位符以确保安全，是一把 5.56 毫米的 Heckler and Koch G-36C，专为特种作战设计。为了适应这一角色，设计者在武器顶部和护木的侧面及底部增加了皮卡汀尼导轨，以便快速安装各种瞄准镜和配件；较短的枪管长度使其非常适合近距离战斗，尤其是在 NERV 总部这样的狭小空间；更重要的是，这一系列的突击步枪只需几个工具就能快速定制成任何配置。

"They're in the second part of the inventory list," Agent Shinichi Morisato said as he pored over the list on his clipboard, while other Section Two men inspected the weapons piece by piece, checking their physical condition for any flaws; they had six container vans' worth of killing power to comb through, and they want to make sure they work straight out of the box.  
"它们在库存清单的第二部分，" 森里真一郎特工一边说，一边仔细查看他剪贴板上的清单，而其他第二科的人员则一件件检查武器，仔细检查它们的物理状况是否有瑕疵；他们有六辆集装箱货车的杀伤力需要梳理，他们希望确保这些武器一开箱就能正常使用。

"I see," Tsutomo agreed, staring at the sleek lines of the rifle. "But this is awesome, and it'll come in handy, considering how high we are," he remarked happily.  
"我明白了，" 筒友同意道，盯着那支步枪流畅的线条。"但这真是太棒了，考虑到我们的高度，这会很有用的，" 他高兴地评论道。

Since the average Japanese were low in stature (generally five feet and six inches), assault weapons (since the introduction of the specially-designed 7.62mm Type-64 for the Self-Defense Force) had to be short and light for easy handling, hence the need for rifles with 12-inch barrels, polymers and light alloy materials, and smaller grip diameters. In this case, Tsutomo figured that the G-36C and its extensive use of polymer materials in its light construction would befit Misato, as she stood at least 5'4" and might not have enough upper-body and arm strength to carry heavier rifles, such as the stock Colt M4A1, which was mostly made out of steel.  
由于普通日本人的平均身高较低（通常为五英尺六英寸），突击武器（自特别设计的 7.62 毫米 64 式自卫队专用步枪问世以来）必须短小轻便，易于操作，因此需要配备 12 英寸枪管、聚合物和轻合金材料以及较小握把直径的步枪。在这种情况下，筒友认为 G-36C 及其在轻型构造中广泛使用的聚合物材料将适合美里，因为她至少有 5 英尺 4 英寸高，可能没有足够的上身和手臂力量来携带更重的步枪，比如主要由钢制成的标准柯尔特 M4A1。

Tsutomo swung the German rifle up, as if to aim, testing the feel of its weight as his right eye bore through the steel sights. He then laid the weapon back into its box, nodded in satisfaction and said, "Reserve one of these for Colonel Katsuragi. I'm sure she'll appreciate it."  
筒友将那把德国步枪举起，仿佛要瞄准，右眼透过钢制瞄准器感受其重量。随后他将武器放回箱中，满意地点点头说道：“给片木上校留一支。我相信她会喜欢的。”

Shinichi nodded as he scribbled a note on the clipboard. "Sure, and she'll really need a superb tack driver. What about yours? Have you picked what you like?"  
进一在剪贴板上草草记下。“当然，她确实需要一把精准的狙击枪。你的呢？选好了吗？”

Tsutomo walked over to another opened crate and fished out a customized M4 with a specialty 12-inch tactical handguard with rails, a polymer adjustable butt, and it looked real solid. Peering closer and twirling it around, this particular rifle had a lot of aftermarket goodies screwed in and bolted, and stamped on the magazine well, in lieu of Colt's famous rearing stallion, was the name _LaRue Tactical_ with the distinctive state of Texas outline.  
筒友走到另一个打开的箱子旁，掏出一把定制的 M4，配备有特殊 12 英寸战术护木导轨、聚合物可调枪托，看上去非常结实。他凑近细看并转动枪身，这把步枪上装满了各种改装配件，而在弹匣井处，取代柯尔特著名的奔马标志的，是 LaRue Tactical 的名字和得克萨斯州的轮廓。

"Shit, this looks and feels very good," Tsutomo remarked favorably as he swung the rifle to an aiming position. "Where this came from?"  
"妈的，这看起来和手感都非常棒，" 筒本赞叹着将步枪摆到瞄准位置，"这玩意儿哪儿来的？"

Shinichi flipped through his inventory list and found the entry for the rifle. "Well," he said, "going by the serial number, that baby once belonged to the Delta Force, and as expected, those commandoes will soup up any weaponry they have for maximum performance. With that rifle you're holding, it's been built more of as a precision weapon because the barrel's machined for greater accuracy and range."  
新一翻阅着他的库存清单，找到了步枪的条目。"嗯，"他说，"根据序列号来看，这宝贝曾经属于三角洲部队，不出所料，那些突击队员会为他们的武器进行升级，以达到最佳性能。你手里的这把步枪，更偏向于精密武器，因为枪管经过加工，提高了精度和射程。"

Tsutomo nodded as he snapped the safety to burst and pulled the rifle's trigger, in double-tap fashion, at an imaginary target. "Like, no fuss, no muss."  
筒本点头，将保险调至连发模式，对着想象中的目标以双击方式扣动扳机。"就像，无需麻烦，干净利落。"

"Right," Shinichi agreed. "Now, do you want that?"  
"好的，" 新一同意道。"那么，你想要这个吗？"

The agent grinned, as if he was like a kid opening a gift on Christmas Day. "Of course. Reserve this for me."  
特工咧嘴一笑，仿佛他就像圣诞节那天拆礼物的孩子一样。"当然。给我留着。"

While Ritsuko and Natsumi were busy helping Rei get back onto her feet, writing down their favorable findings as they gave her a final checkup, and all the while the other three Children were watching, Misato went over to a nearby phone on the counter, and dialed for Fuyutsuki's office.  
当律子和夏美忙着帮助丽重新站起来，记录下她们的积极发现并为她做最后的检查时，其他三个孩子都在一旁观看，美里走到附近的柜台电话旁，拨通了冬月办公室的电话。

"Yes, this is Fuyutsuki," the old man said at the other end. "Who is this?"  
"是的，这里是冬月，" 电话那头的老者说道，"请问您是哪位？"

"It's me, sir," Misato replied.  
"是我，长官，" 美里回答道。"

"Oh," Fuyutsuki blurted, recognizing the woman's voice. "I'm working on administrative things, trying to cut out some of the red tape. What news do you have?"  
"哦，" 冬月脱口而出，认出了女人的声音，"我正在处理一些行政事务，试图削减一些繁文缛节。你有什么消息吗？"

"We found what we might need, but I can't tell you about over the phone, so it would be necessary if you could come here and see."  
"我们找到了可能需要的东西，但电话里说不清楚，所以如果你能亲自过来一趟，那就最好了。"

There was a momentary pause, as if Fuyutsuki was pondering on what she really meant. "Okay, Colonel, I've got what you mean," he finally decided, realizing that whatever she would present to him was too sensitive to talk over the phone. "I'll come, but where?"  
短暂的停顿，仿佛冬月在思索她话中的深意。“好的，上校，我明白了，”他最终决定道，意识到她将要展示给他的东西过于敏感，不宜在电话中讨论。“我会来的，但具体在哪里？”

"Here at my quarters in the BOQ. Have to keep this under guard."  
"在我 BOQ 的住处。必须严加看守。"

"Okay, as soon as I get finished. Thank you," the elderly Sub-Commander said before hanging up.  
“好的，我一忙完就过来。谢谢您。”老副司令说完便挂断了电话。

"Well?" Natsumi asked. “怎么样？”夏美问道。

Misato put the phone down back into its cradle. "I just asked the Sub-Commander to come and see for himself what we have discovered," she replied.  
美里将电话放回原位。“我刚请副司令亲自来看看我们的发现。”她回答道。

"Ah." The younger doctor then went over to the EEG machine and rolled up the electrodes to be set aside.  
"啊。" 年轻的医生随后走向脑电图机，卷起电极准备放置一旁。

"Oh, I forgot to ask."  
"哦，我忘了问。"

Natsumi blinked. "What?"  
夏美眨了眨眼。 "什么？"

"Why don't you and Tomo come down at the O-Club tonight? You two wanted to go on a date, right?"  
"今晚你和 Tomo 怎么不来 O-Club 呢？你们俩不是想约会吗？"

This time the young doctor blinked. "Oh… Yeah, I forgot," she answered and then cracked a smile. "Looks like I'll have to text him. Better to have something substantial than nothing at all."  
这次年轻的医生眨了眨眼。"哦……是啊，我忘了，"她回答道，然后露出了笑容。"看来我得给他发个短信。总比什么都没有强。"

"Good," Misato approved as she watched Natsumi pull out her mobile phone and began making a text message, before she turned her attention to Rei. "Guess from now on we'll have to be very careful with what we say," she remarked to the girl.  
"好，"美里赞同地看着夏美拿出手机开始发短信，然后转向丽。"看来从现在开始，我们说话得非常小心了，"她对女孩说道。

"This will be a secret among us," Rei answered. "He must not know of this truth."  
"这将是我们之间的秘密，"丽回答道。"他绝不能知晓这个真相。"

"Father wouldn't be happy if he knows," Shinji said.  
"父亲要是知道了，肯定不会高兴的，"真嗣说。"

Rei nodded as she pushed herself off the bed and straightened out her school uniform. "That is right."  
丽点头，从床上起身，整理了一下校服。"没错。"

He then turned to Asuka and said, "As soon as we get back to our room, why don't you tell me about your mom? Why don't we talk about her?"  
他随后转向明日香，说道：“我们一回到房间，你为什么不跟我谈谈你妈妈呢？我们为什么不聊聊她呢？”

Asuka sighed. "Okay," she agreed in a rather glum tone. "And with Kaji's files, I wanted to know what really happened to her." The girl then pointed at the box sitting on the counter.  
明日香叹了口气。“好吧，”她用相当沮丧的语气同意了。“而且有了加持的文件，我想知道她到底发生了什么。”女孩随后指着放在柜台上的盒子。

"Oh, by the way," Misato called out to Kaworu, who had spoke little and right now waiting for Rei. "Do you have anything else to do?"  
“哦，对了，”美里朝真嗣喊道，他话不多，现在正等着绫波。“你还有什么别的事要做吗？”

Kaworu shook his head. "No, nothing much."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“不，没什么。”

"While I have to get Kaji's stuff checked out and organized for Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki to see, you and Rei can order us some dinner down at the Cafeteria, we'll eat at our quarters and then we get some rest for tonight," Misato suggested.  
“我得把加持的东西检查整理一下，让副司令冬月先生过目，你和绫波可以去食堂点些晚餐，我们在宿舍吃，然后今晚好好休息，”美里提议道。

"No problem," Kaworu said, nodding as he watched Misato pick up a pad and a pen, and wrote down their order before tearing off the sheet, fished out a couple of 1000-yen bills from her purse, and handed both to the Fifth Children.  
“没问题，”渚薰点头说道，看着美里拿起便签和笔，写下订单后撕下纸条，从钱包里掏出几张一千日元的钞票，递给了第五适格者。

"It's been a long day for all of us… and what about you two?" Misato then asked Ritsuko and Natsumi.  
"对我们所有人来说，今天真是漫长的一天……你们俩呢？" 美里随后问理津子和夏美。

"I have to get back to my analysis work," Ritsuko said. "Tons of it, but I'll try to come later."  
"我得回去继续我的分析工作，" 理津子说。"大量的工作，但我尽量晚些时候过来。"

"Need to finish my rounds first," Natsumi added. "You know, I have to check on my patients, who crashed and burned and got shot at yesterday." She was referring to the security troopers who were injured in yesterday's ambush on the convoy.  
"得先完成我的巡视，" 夏美补充道。"你知道的，我得检查我的病人，他们昨天被伏击，受伤严重。" 她指的是昨天车队遇袭时受伤的安保人员。

Misato nodded. "I see," she said, before gesturing at the Children that they have to leave now. "C'mon guys, let's go now," she ordered.  
美里点了点头。“我明白了，”她说着，示意孩子们现在必须离开。“好了，大家，我们现在走吧，”她命令道。

Halfway through his inspection, Tsutomo felt his phone vibrate and he snatched it from his pocket and checked the message. It said: _You busy?_ _Are you coming with me tonight? I'm ready as soon as I get finished. – Natsumi._  
检查到一半时，筒友感到手机震动，他迅速从口袋里掏出手机查看信息。上面写着：你忙吗？今晚和我一起去吗？我一结束就准备好了。——夏美。

Tsutomo smiled as he replied: _Sure, no problem. Better than to have nothing to do or complain._  
筒友笑着回复道：当然，没问题。总比无所事事或抱怨要好。

He went back to eyeballing one of the heftier FN M-240 heavy machine guns, from the box and free of Cosmoline, testing it for functionality, making sure that its firing mechanism was in working condition when his phone vibrated again.  
他回到那箱子旁，仔细打量着其中一把较重的 FN M-240 重机枪，这枪已去除防锈的 Cosmoline，他检查其功能性，确保其发射机制处于良好状态，这时他的手机再次震动起来。

_I see,_ Natsumi said. _OBTW, one of the Children found dossiers that belonged to Kaji. The Sub-Commander is coming to see them._  
我明白了，Natsumi 说。顺便说一下，孩子们找到了一些属于加持的档案。副司令要来看这些文件。

That really surprised him, and he responded, pressing the keypad frantically: _Wow. I hope it could help us track down the mole we're hunting for. Where are those files right now?_  
这让他非常惊讶，他急忙按下键盘回复道：哇。希望这能帮助我们追踪到正在寻找的那个内鬼。那些文件现在在哪里？

Immediately Natsumi texted back: _They're with Misato. Doesn't want them to fall into the Commander's hands. Again it's our secret._  
立刻，夏美回复道：他们和美里在一起。不想让他们再次落入司令手中。这又是我们的秘密。

_Okay,_ Tsutomo said. _I'll see them later, thanks. See you at the O-Club._  
好的，筒本说。我晚点见他们，谢谢。俱乐部见。

---

Back in their quarters, while Misato was busy browsing through the rest of Kaji's SD card on her laptop, and while Kaworu and Rei went down to the Cafeteria to order some boxed dinner for all of them, Shinji pulled out a piece of paper from the metal box.  
回到他们的宿舍，当美里忙着在笔记本电脑上浏览卡兹的 SD 卡剩余内容时，而渚和绫波则下到食堂去为大家订购一些盒饭，真嗣从金属盒中取出一张纸。

"So, this is her, all right?" Shinji asked Asuka as he held a Xerox copy of the late Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu's personal information, all typed out in English, a language that was hard for him to master:  
"那么，这就是她了，对吧？" 真嗣问明日香，他手里拿着一份已故的葛城直子·齐柏林·惣流的个人资料复印件，全部用英语打字，这对他来说是一种难以掌握的语言：

_**KYOKO ZEPPELIN SORYU (1974-2005)**__  
Position: Chief Scientist, Project E Research and Development Division, NERV Germany  
职位：首席科学家，E 计划研发部，NERV 德国分部

教育程度：斯图加特大学 - 分子生物学博士（1996 年）_

Asuka nodded after scanning the document. "Yep, that's her," she confirmed, rummaging through the scraps in the box, looking for anything connected to her mother. "Misato, you got something on Mom?"  
明日香在浏览完文件后点了点头。“是的，就是她，”她一边确认，一边在箱子里翻找着与母亲有关的任何东西。“美里，你有没有关于妈妈的线索？”

"Uh, wait a second," Misato answered. "I think there's a file or two in here," she said, pointing at a pair of ZIP files, both carrying the suffix SORYU in the filenames.  
“呃，等一下，”美里回答道，“我想这里面有一两个文件，”她指着一对 ZIP 文件说，文件名后缀都带有 SORYU。

"Open them up," Asuka ordered and Misato unzipped the files into a directory. Inside, there were several PDF files and the older woman opened the first, which turned out to be a full confidential report on the testing accident; the second ZIP file consisted of several medical records that chronicled the deteriorating psychological condition of Doctor Soryu, three files from the police, an autopsy report from the coroner, and a bunch of legal documents connected to the deceased woman.  
“打开它们，”明日香命令道，美里将文件解压到一个目录中。里面有几个 PDF 文件，年长的女性打开了第一个，结果是一份关于测试事故的完整机密报告；第二个 ZIP 文件包含了几份医疗记录，详细记载了碇博士日益恶化的心理状况，三份来自警方的文件，一份法医的验尸报告，以及一堆与已故女性相关的法律文件。

"Let's see the full report first," Misato decided, and began to read the document, translating it to Japanese as she spoke:  
“我们先看看完整报告，”美里决定，并开始阅读文档，边读边翻译成日语：

_**TOP SECRET NOFORN NOCOPY / FOUO / UN SECY GEN EYES ONLY**__**SEQUENCE OF EVENTS / INCIDENT E  
_绝密 仅限内部使用 禁止复制 / 仅供官方使用 / 联合国秘书长及总参谋部专用__**事件序列 / 事故 E  
**__Dr. Erich B. Weiss, Assistant Chief of Research and Development, NERV Germany_  
**_埃里希·B·魏斯博士，NERV 德国研发部副主任

_The following is a chronological sequence of events:  
以下是按时间顺序排列的事件序列：_

_**September 15.**_ _Eva Production Type Unit-02 was delivered to the facility from Dresden. This Eva was wrapped down completely, had to peel off protective covering in the clean area. Took about 10 hours for the polyethylene wrappers and the cryogenic lines (intended to keep the Eva cooled down while on transit) to be removed._  
9 月 15 日。Eva 生产型二号机从德累斯顿运抵设施。这台 Eva 被完全包裹，必须在清洁区域内剥去保护层。花费约 10 小时移除聚乙烯包装和低温管道（用于在运输过程中保持 Eva 冷却）。

_**September 16.**_ _Unit-02 given a full decontamination wash-down, then for testing we connected it to the power source and ran the initial system diagnostics. So far okay, no anomalies, not unlike what happened to Ikari (with the Test Type) more than a year ago._  
9 月 16 日。二号机进行了全面去污清洗，随后连接到电源并运行初始系统诊断测试。目前一切正常，无异常情况，与一年多前碇（与试验机型）的情况相似。

_**September 17.**_ _Full conference with R&D staff. After a full consensus, Doctor Kyoko Soryu decided to volunteer herself for the contact experiment. Later that day she went through a medical examination and psychological evaluation. Both tests confirmed her ready for the experiment._  
9 月 17 日。与研发团队召开全面会议。经过充分讨论，赤城博士决定自愿参与接触实验。当天晚些时候，她接受了体检和心理评估。两项测试均确认她已准备好进行实验。

_**September 18. 8:31 am.**_ _Unit-02 prepped, connected and bolted on. All monitoring systems were on and running; sensors were online. It was decided that the following initial settings must be used: voltage (48.21 MeV), core freq (46.2 Ghz), plug depth (0.120), temperature (38.2 C); we should not repeat the earlier discrepancy made by Dr. Ikari, who used the wrong settings and thus responsible for her death. Soryu has undergone for a last checkup before suiting up. Entry Plug was inspected as per regulations and thus approved for use._  
9 月 18 日，上午 8:31。二号机已准备就绪，连接并固定。所有监测系统均已启动并运行；传感器在线。决定采用以下初始设置：电压（48.21 MeV），核心频率（46.2 GHz），插头深度（0.120），温度（38.2 C）；我们不应重复碇博士之前的错误设置，正是这些错误导致了她的死亡。惣流已接受最后一次体检，即将穿上装备。驾驶舱按照规定进行了检查，并已获准使用。

_**9:02 am.**_ _Dr. Soryu ready and wearing a test suit. Resembling a scuba diver's suit, this test suit is made of thousands of sensors weaved into the suit fabric, all connected to a single processor and wireless telemetry unit located in the back. She tells us, however, that she wished her daughter (Asuka) be at least present to watch the test proceedings, but Chief Ikari, who's watching all this via teleconferencing from the AEL in Japan, disallowed such a privilege (perhaps due to the earlier trauma of letting his son watch the contact experiment for Unit-01)._  
上午 9:02。惣流博士已准备就绪，身穿测试服。这套测试服类似于潜水服，由数千个编织进服装面料的传感器组成，所有传感器连接到一个位于背部的处理器和无线遥测单元。然而，她告诉我们，她希望她的女儿（明日香）至少能在场观看测试过程，但碇首席从日本 AEL 通过远程会议观看这一切，不允许这样的特权（或许是出于之前让他的儿子观看初号机接触实验的创伤）。

_**9:21 am.**_ _Dr. Soryu boards the Entry Plug, and insertion is performed. Plug is filled with electrolyte (LCL) then power is connected to Unit-02. Harmonics stabilized at normal levels, as we were now running the experiment at recommended settings._  
上午 9:21。碇唯博士进入插入栓，执行插入操作。插入栓内充满电解液（LCL），随后为 2 号机接通电源。谐波稳定在正常水平，我们此时按照推荐设置进行实验。

_**9:35 am.**_ _Dr. Soryu orders us to adjust plug depth to 0.130. All normal at this point, except for a noticeable increase in synapse energy and brainwave activity coming from the Eva. Likewise, being the test subject, Dr. Soryu's brain activity exhibited unusual behavior, as her heart rate and breathing increased._  
上午 9:35。碇唯博士命令我们将插入深度调整为 0.130。此时一切正常，除了来自 Eva 的突触能量和脑波活动明显增加。同样，作为测试对象，碇唯博士的脑活动表现出异常行为，她的心率和呼吸也增加了。

_**9:38 am.**_ _Unit-02 goes out of control, when the plug depth unexpectedly plummeted to 1.148, which is considered a dangerous contamination level (Great Beyond Depth threshold is usually 0.180). Experiment aborted immediately, forced to eject the plug, then shut down the Eva. Damage is considerable, with Unit-02 having wrecked up the test site._  
上午 9:38。2 号机失控，插入深度意外骤降至 1.148，这被视为危险污染水平（通常大深度阈值为 0.180）。实验立即中止，被迫弹出插入栓，随后关闭 Eva。损坏严重，2 号机已将测试场地破坏殆尽。

_**9:46 am.**_ _With our rescue team, we managed to extricate Dr. Soryu from the plug, only to discover that despite she was still in generally good physical health and therefore have no external injuries, she was exhibiting symptoms of extreme psychological instability, including hysterical laughter and sudden fits of physical violence. It was decided that we have to subdue her with sedatives, then bring her into the hospital for further examination and observation. (For full video of entire experiment, please refer to video file 3019_SORYU_TEST_02)_  
上午 9:46。我们救援队成功将碇唯博士从插入栓中救出，却发现尽管她身体状况总体良好，没有明显外伤，却表现出极端的心理不稳定症状，包括歇斯底里的笑声和突发的身体暴力行为。我们决定用镇静剂使其镇定，然后将她送往医院进行进一步检查和观察。（完整实验视频请参阅视频文件 3019_SORYU_TEST_02）

_**10:09 am.**_ _Have no choice, but on Chief Ikari's strict orders we have to put Unit-02 under full scrutiny, and after three days of investigation will also have to lock down, seal and store that Eva under cryostasis until further notice._  
上午 10:09。在碇源堂司令的严格命令下，我们别无选择，必须对二号机进行全面审查，经过三天的调查后，还需将其封存并置于低温休眠状态，直至另行通知。

_**2:15 pm.**_ _A team of psychologists concluded that psychological damage to Dr. Soryu was beyond recovery, and they have recommended confinement under indefinite close watch and under further notice. Official inquiry is now underway._  
下午 2:15。一组心理学家得出结论，碇唯博士的心理创伤已无法恢复，他们建议对其进行无限期严密监控，直至另行通知。官方调查正在进行中。

_**3:36 pm.**_ _Mr. Langley arrived, demanding to know what happened to Dr. Soryu. Told him what happened, but I was puzzled about his unusually calm reaction regarding his wife's condition. Had a short conference thereafter with the medical staff; we do not wish to allow her daughter to see her in such a state, although the father insisted on having the girl visit her mother. I fear for the worst._  
下午 3:36。兰利先生到达，追问索吕博士发生了什么事。我告诉他情况，但他对妻子状况异常平静的反应让我困惑。之后与医疗团队简短商讨；我们不希望让她的女儿看到她这副模样，尽管父亲坚持要让女孩探望母亲。我担心最坏的情况。

Asuka was silent once Misato was done. They couldn't quite clarify as to why her mom became insane, yet there was another file explaining why, dated a week after the incident:  
当美里说完后，明日香沉默了。她们无法明确解释她妈妈为何发疯，但另一份文件说明了原因，日期是事件发生一周后：

_It was determined that during the experiment, somehow her soul was split into two parts; one was absorbed into the Eva, the other was left in her mind and physical body. Unfortunately this phenomenon caused serious psychological damage that she exhibited the following symptoms: (1) she exhibited child-like behavior similar to that of a five-year-old child; (2) a doll was provided to keep her preoccupied, that eventually became a substitute for her child; (3) she had apparent suicidal thoughts and therefore spoke of suicide and/or repeatedly strangled the doll until it was decapitated; (4) she was talking incoherently at times or spoke in child-like language; (5) completely unable to recognize anyone close to her, including her daughter Asuka or her spouse or her other co-workers.  
实验过程中，不知何故她的灵魂被分裂成两部分；一部分被吸入 Eva，另一部分则留在她的心智和肉体中。不幸的是，这种现象造成了严重的心理创伤，她表现出以下症状：（1）她展现出类似五岁儿童的幼稚行为；（2）提供了一个玩偶来让她分心，最终这个玩偶成了她孩子的替代品；（3）她明显有自杀念头，因此经常谈论自杀或反复勒紧玩偶直至其断头；（4）有时她语无伦次，或使用孩童般的语言；（5）完全无法认出任何亲近的人，包括她的女儿明日香、配偶或其他同事。_

_It is unfortunate for us and for her that all attempts at rehabilitating her by means of therapy and other available methods of treatment have failed to turn Dr. Soryu around; therefore we have concluded that this damage is permanent and irreversible and we recommend close monitoring of her deviant behavior.  
遗憾的是，我们和她都未能通过各种疗法和其他可用治疗方法使惣流博士康复；因此我们得出结论，这种伤害是永久且不可逆的，我们建议对其异常行为进行密切监控。_

Finally, there was a police report on the suicide, two weeks after:  
最终，在两周后有一份关于自杀的警方报告：

_At approximately 9:48 am, after receiving an emergency call from the hospital staff, we found Dr. Soryu's corpse hanging from the ceiling, with her daughter Asuka standing there, hysterically screaming and crying at the sight of her mother's corpse. Apparently the woman used her blanket, then while standing from her bed she punched out the fiberboard off the ceiling and tied the blanket onto a water pipe, before tying her neck and jumped off the bed. When we found the corpse, she was dead for about 30 minutes. Cause of death was asphyxiation by hanging. Except for the presence of her daughter, who presumably found her first, there was also no sign of any foul play. Although we have experts who can help the girl to give us a statement, Mr. Langley refused any attempts at communication with his daughter, citing privacy concerns.  
大约上午 9 点 48 分，接到医院工作人员的紧急电话后，我们发现 Soryu 医生的尸体悬挂在天花板上，她的女儿 Asuka 站在那里，看到母亲的尸体后歇斯底里地尖叫和哭泣。显然，这名女子使用了她的毯子，然后站在床上，打穿了天花板上的纤维板，将毯子系在水管上，随后将脖子套进去并跳下了床。当我们发现尸体时，她已经死亡约 30 分钟。死因是窒息性吊死。除了她的女儿，据推测是第一个发现她的人，现场也没有任何谋杀的迹象。尽管我们有专家可以帮助女孩提供陈述，但 Langley 先生拒绝了与女儿沟通的任何尝试，理由是隐私问题。_

Asuka closed her eyes and sighed, but Shinji comforted her by holding the girl's hand.  
Asuka 闭上眼睛叹了口气，但 Shinji 通过握住女孩的手来安慰她。

"I'm sorry," Shinji whispered.

The girl nodded. "I know, all this isn't going to bring her back," she said. "It's just that… No, she didn't told me it would be dangerous for her, yet it was her decision to take the risk."  
女孩点点头。“我知道，这一切都不会让她回来，”她说。“只是……不，她没有告诉我这对她来说很危险，但这是她自己决定要冒险的。”

"She didn't backed out," Misato added. "It was the part of her job to advance her field as much as possible, even if it meant risking her life. That's the hard reality of science, especially when moving into unknown territory."  
"她没有退缩，" 美里补充道。"她的工作就是尽可能推进她的领域，即使这意味着冒生命危险。这是科学的残酷现实，尤其是在进入未知领域时。"

Asuka shook her head. "That puts us in the same boat, right?" she asked Shinji, who nodded back in agreement, as they now both knew that they lost their mothers to the Evas.  
明日香摇了摇头。"那我们处境相同了，对吧？" 她问真嗣，后者点头表示同意，因为他们现在都知道，他们的母亲都因 Eva 而丧生。

"Me, too," Misato said. "Even if I despise him for that, Father died for what he believed in."  
"我也是，" 美里说。"即使我因为他那样做而憎恨他，但父亲是为他所信仰的东西而死的。"

Asuka frowned. "What?" 明日香皱起眉头。“什么？”

"To make it short, he made up his S2 Theory, then went to Antarctica to find his proof and found it, tested it, and… Damn, it killed him." The woman sighed and bit her lip. "That's why you're not alone, and that's why we're all in this together, so remember that."  
“简而言之，他构思出了 S2 理论，然后前往南极寻找证据，找到了，验证了，然后……该死，这让他丧命了。”女人叹了口气，咬了咬嘴唇。“这就是为什么你不孤单，这就是为什么我们都在一起，所以记住这一点。”

---

On the other hand, Rei and Kaworu were done buying dinner bento boxes for the five of them at the Cafeteria, and, carrying the boxes in take-out bags, they boarded the elevator back to the billeting floor. Once the doors closed on them, and the elevator lurched upward, they began to talk.  
另一方面，绫波零和渚薰已经买好了五人份的晚餐便当，提着外卖袋子，他们登上了返回住宿层的电梯。门一关上，电梯开始上升，他们便开始交谈。

"It's been a close call," Kaworu said as he set one of the bags down on the floor and felt for the change in his pocket.  
"真是千钧一发啊，"渚薰说着将一个袋子放在地上，伸手去摸口袋里的零钱。

"Why?" Rei asked. "为什么？" 绫波零问道。

Kaworu sighed. "Asuka almost figured out who I really was, because I went too far by probing into her dream and telling her what better to do. At that moment, I thought I was so stupid… Otherwise, things would've been different had if she asked me if I was an Angel."  
渚薰叹了口气。"明日香差点就识破了我的真实身份，因为我太过深入她的梦境并告诉她该如何做。那一刻，我觉得自己真是愚蠢……否则，如果她问我是否是使徒，情况就会大不相同了。"

"She was being curious, wondering why you did that."  
"她变得好奇，想知道你为什么那样做。"

"Of course out of sympathy I had to intervene, and I have this unstoppable compulsion to be curious, to be sympathetic and then help people if they're in need."  
"出于同情，我不得不介入，而且我有一种无法抑制的冲动，想要好奇、同情，并在他们需要帮助时伸出援手。"

Rei frowned a bit. "Do you think it is bad for you?"  
丽皱了皱眉。 "你觉得这对你不好吗？"

Kaworu shook his head. "No, but at times I wonder if I was doing the right thing. I'm also trying to be very careful with the things I do."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“不，但有时我会怀疑自己是否在做正确的事。我也尽量小心谨慎地行事。”

The elevator slowed down and halted at the BOQ floor, and then the doors slid open, before they stepped out and walked towards Misato's quarters.  
电梯减速并在 BOQ 楼层停下，随后门缓缓打开，他们走出电梯，朝美里住处走去。

"Tell you what, Rei," Kaworu said. "You never fail to amaze me."  
“告诉你吧，绫波，”渚薰说，“你总是让我感到惊讶。”

Rei blinked. "Why?" 丽眨了眨眼。“为什么？”

"You discovered who you really were, you were speaking more often than you used to, and now… You even have a past life, and you called Shinji your brother." Kaworu then broke into a smile and chuckled. "Good thing the Commander hasn't seen you yet since the last time, and if he were to know what's really going on with you, well, he'll be greatly surprised."  
“你发现了自己的真实身份，说话比以前多了，现在……你甚至有了前世，还称真嗣为你的兄弟。”薰随后露出了微笑，轻声笑了起来。“还好司令自上次以来还没见过你，如果他知道你到底发生了什么，那他一定会大吃一惊。”

Both of them were now standing right before the door.  
两人现在正站在门前。

"Speaking of him," Rei said. "It seems that he has forgotten me."  
"说到他，" 丽说道。"看来他已经把我忘了。"

Kaworu shrugged. "He might be busy or thinking about Instrumentality or… I have no idea. He's still a strange man, after all." He then knocked twice and the door slid open, to see that Shinji was waiting for them. They also noted that Misato and Asuka were busy right in front of the laptop, probably reading something off the screen.  
渚薰耸了耸肩。"他可能很忙，或者在思考人类补完计划，又或者……我也不清楚。他毕竟还是个奇怪的人。" 接着他敲了两下门，门便滑开了，只见真嗣正在等他们。他们还注意到美里和明日香正忙着在笔记本电脑前，大概是在看屏幕上的什么东西。

"What do we have now?" the Third Children asked, smiling, as they walked in, took off their footwear, and deposited the bags on the dinner table.  
"我们现在有什么？" 第三适格者微笑着问道，他们走进来，脱下鞋子，把包放在餐桌上了。

"_Sozai_ for Rei and I," Kaworu said, reciting from the receipt, "you and Asuka get a beef gyudon special, and Misato has her spiced chicken teriyaki… and oh, there's some miso soup, takoyaki and dumplings… and be careful, they're all hot and fresh."  
“这是给丽和我准备的，”渚薰念着收据上的内容，“你和明日香的是牛肉盖饭特餐，美里的是香辣鸡肉照烧……哦，还有味噌汤、章鱼烧和饺子……小心点，都是刚出炉的，很烫。”

"Okay," Shinji said, nodding as he pulled the boxes out of the bags and gingerly set them on the table, as the contents were still hot.  
“好的，”真嗣点头应道，从袋子里拿出盒子，小心翼翼地放在桌上，因为里面的食物还很热。

While Rei, feeling exhausted, sat down on the sofa to rest and close her eyes for a while, Kaworu walked over to Misato and gave her the change he carried in his pocket. She counted the money and deposited it besides the laptop.  
丽感到疲惫，便坐在沙发上休息，闭目养神。与此同时，渚薰走到美里身边，把口袋里的零钱递给她。她数了数钱，然后放在笔记本电脑旁边。

"We're reading more on Asuka's mom," Misato said.  
"我们正在读更多关于明日香妈妈的内容，"美里说。

"On what?" Kaworu asked.  
"关于什么？" 渚薰问道。

"I'm trying to find out as to how she died," Asuka replied, tapping the scroll keys as she read.  
"我正在努力查明她是如何去世的，"明日香回答，一边敲击着滚动键一边阅读。

Kaworu blinked. "Oh."

"She volunteered for the contact experiment," the redhead explained. "Never thought of backing out. She did it because she thought she was contributing something substantial to science."  
"她自愿参加了接触实验，"红发女孩解释道。"从未想过退出。她这么做是因为她认为自己为科学做出了重大贡献。"

This time Kaworu looked glum. "I see. Again, I'm sorry for your loss."  
这一次，渚薰看起来有些沮丧。"我明白了。再次，我为你的损失感到抱歉。"

"That's okay," Asuka replied, nodding. "I'm reading this stuff to make things clear for me, because back then I didn't quite understand why she hanged herself, or why she kept talking of dying, or—" the girl shook her head. "I just wanted answers to many things that were left unsaid since I was four."  
"没关系，"明日香点头回答。"我读这些资料是为了让自己更明白，因为那时我不太理解她为什么上吊自杀，或者为什么她总是谈论死亡，或者——"女孩摇了摇头。"我只是想找到许多从我四岁起就未曾解答的问题的答案。"

"I see," Kaworu agreed as he watched Shinji prepare the dinner table, laying out the food and the chopsticks and everything, even the dinnertime beverage of iced tea (with the exception of Misato, of course with an opened can of chilled Yebisu, for she couldn't enjoy dinner without this form of ambrosia).  
"我明白了，" 渚薰一边说，一边看着真嗣准备晚餐桌，摆放食物、筷子和一切，甚至连冰镇茶饮料都准备好了（当然，美里除外，她总是要一罐冰镇的 Yebisu 啤酒，没有这个她可享受不了晚餐）。

"Dinner's ready," Shinji called out, before he walked over to the napping Rei and tapped her on the shoulder. She blinked.  
"晚餐准备好了，" 真嗣喊道，然后他走到正在打盹的绫波零身边，轻轻拍了拍她的肩膀。她眨了眨眼。

"I am sorry for being tired," the girl said, but she stood up.  
"对不起，我有点累，" 女孩说道，但她还是站了起来。

"No problem," Shinji reassured her.  
"没问题，" 真嗣安慰她。

Misato nodded to Asuka, and both women rose up and straightened out. "C'mon," she said. "You can come back to it if you want to."  
美里向明日香点头示意，两位女士站起身来整理了一下。"来吧，"她说，"如果你想的话，可以回来继续。"

"Okay," the redhead answered, and together they ambled towards the dinner table and sat down.  
"好的，" 红发女孩回答，他们一起慢悠悠地走向餐桌坐下。

For a moment, Shinji realized that this was the first time they are now having a private dinner together, like a surrogate family. He first turned his attention to Asuka, seated besides him, and she smiled and said, "Feeling home?"  
有那么一刻，真嗣意识到这是他们第一次像一个代理家庭一样私下共进晚餐。他首先转向坐在身边的明日香，她微笑着问道：“感觉像家吗？”

"Well, yeah," Shinji answered cheerfully, before he glanced at Rei and Kaworu, seated on their opposite. "Again, I feel as if almost everything that I wanted was handed back to me… and Ayanami, I guess I'll have to get used to calling you in a new way."  
“嗯，是的，”真嗣愉快地回答，然后瞥了一眼坐在对面的绫波和薰。“再次，我感觉我几乎想要的一切都回到了我身边……绫波，我想我得习惯用新的方式称呼你了。”

While everyone else chuckled, Rei blinked. "Pardon me, my brother?" she asked.  
当其他人轻笑时，绫波眨了眨眼。“请原谅，我的兄弟？”她问道。

Shinji sighed and smiled. "It's going to be no big deal calling you my _sister_."  
真嗣叹了口气，微笑着说：“叫你姐姐，也没什么大不了的。”

"Well?" Misato budged in, and the Children nodded without a word, as if saying "Go on".  
“那么？”美里凑近了些，孩子们默默点头，仿佛在说“继续”。

As Misato was the eldest and thus placed at the head of the table, she finally had the honor of inaugurating their first dinner together as Team Eva by cracking a grin, clapping her hands together and then everyone loudly proclaimed the magic word: _"Itadakimasu!"_  
由于美里年纪最大，因此坐在桌首，她终于有幸为 EVA 小队的首次聚餐揭开序幕，她咧嘴一笑，双手合十，接着大家齐声喊出那句神奇的话：“いただきます！”

Dinnertime went smoothly, as this was the best Shinji had for the longest time. Sure, he didn't have a real family, which he longed for many years, for his father was shut completely in an ivory tower, and his mother's soul resided in the most notorious biological war machine ever built in the history of man, and yet…  
晚餐进行得很顺利，这是真嗣很长时间以来最美好的一次。当然，他没有真正的家庭，这是他多年来渴望的，因为他的父亲完全封闭在一个象牙塔中，而他的母亲的灵魂则寄居在人类历史上最臭名昭著的生物战争机器中，然而……

He was with the only family he had; the eldest surrogate sister who boasted the sexiest body in the entire base, who can whip up a solid battle stratagem that she could go up against the likes of Rommel, Yamamoto, Patton or Nguyen Giap, and yet able to hold up to her own to even the stiffest drinks served at any dive; a redheaded girlfriend who, despite wielding a complete _tsundere_ personality of a giant-cartoon-mallet-packing nagger worthy of a Taiga Aisaka or an Akane Tendou, had as much common ground with him in terms of past lives, ups and downs, which at first anyone think they came from very different worlds and upbringing, but anyway, they were on the same wavelength and Shinji could now speak his mind with her; a very understanding metrosexual friend who'd helped him snap out of his deep blue funk and get a grip at life, and somehow even in a very short time they hit it off like they were childhood pals since kindergarten; and a certain blue-haired girl who, at last, now completely related to Shinji in terms of genetics and thus in partial possession of his mother's personality.  
他与唯一的家人在一起；这位年长的代理姐姐拥有整个基地最性感的身材，能策划出足以与隆美尔、山本五十六、巴顿或武元甲等名将抗衡的坚实战略，还能在任何小酒馆里应对最烈的酒；一位红发女友，尽管她拥有巨型卡通木槌般的大小姐脾气，堪比逢坂大河或茜雫，但与他有着共同的过去和起伏，起初人们以为他们来自截然不同的世界和成长背景，但无论如何，他们心意相通，真嗣现在可以向她倾诉心声；一位非常理解的都市型男朋友，帮助他从深深的忧郁中振作起来，重新掌控生活，不知为何在极短的时间内他们就像幼儿园起的老朋友一样合拍；还有一位蓝发女孩，最终在基因上与真嗣完全相关，从而部分继承了他母亲的个性。

Shinji noted that since it was almost close to Christmas Day, he finally figured out that this was the best gift he gave to himself, without cost, without strings attached nor can be sold or bought or traded. It was priceless, just as that famous Visa advertisement said so.  
碇真嗣注意到，随着圣诞节临近，他终于意识到这是他送给自己的最佳礼物，无需花费，没有附加条件，也不能买卖或交换。正如那则著名的 Visa 广告所说，它是无价的。

However, it wasn't just Shinji who was enjoying all this, as he talked about school and the various hijinks he had with Kensuke and Toji, but each of them had their own little anecdotes to tell and laugh (or in Rei's case, merely smile) about.  
然而，享受这一切的并非只有真嗣一人，当他谈论学校生活以及与健司和渡治的各种恶作剧时，每个人都有自己的小故事可以分享和欢笑（或者在绫波的情况下，只是微笑）。

In this moment lasting approximately forty minutes, they forgot the mole with his plastic bombs, yesterday's terrorist attack and the attempted home invasion that followed, the specter of SEELE lurking a thousand kilometers away, nine Mass-Production Evas waiting to be unleashed, political intrigue on a global scale, Commander Ikari brooding somewhere as Chairman Lorenz was quietly making chess moves for a hostile takeover, and… in Kaworu's case, the Seventeenth Angel just threw out his original secret mission of subjugating NERV.  
在这大约四十分钟的时刻里，他们忘记了那个带着塑料炸弹的间谍、昨天的恐怖袭击及其后的企图闯入、千里之外潜伏的 Seele、九台待命的量产 EVA、全球范围内的政治阴谋、碇司令在某处的沉思、洛伦兹主席悄然进行的敌意收购，以及……在渚薰的情况下，第十七使徒放弃了原本征服 NERV 的秘密任务。

For tonight, to hell with all that, and just once he wanted to be a normal teenager who also wanted to have his first night out with friends... No, with his _own family_, really.  
今晚，去他的那些规矩，他只想做一回普通的青少年，渴望与朋友们——不，是与自己的家人——共度第一个夜晚外出...真的，是与家人。

With this surrogate family that he now belonged to, what more Shinji Ikari could ask for?  
有了这个他如今归属的代理家庭，碇真嗣还能奢求什么呢？

So priceless. 如此珍贵。

"Okay, this is the last batch we have, Lieutenant," one of the officers in charge of reconnaissance systems told Makoto Hyuga, as the final downloads from NERV's orbital reconsat and from the organization's own UAV came into the computer's hard drive.  
“好的，这是我们最后一批数据，指挥官，”负责侦察系统的其中一名军官告诉真希波·真理·石川，当从 NERV 的轨道侦察卫星和组织自己的无人机最终下载到计算机的硬盘时。

With hands on the keyboard and mouse, Makoto adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses and checked every high-resolution picture right on the screen; each picture was taken with a 60-megapixel CCD digital camera from the reconnaissance satellite, and from the 30-megapixel camera mounted on the sensor ball on the nose of an unarmed variant of the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator; the UAV was programmed to fly a predetermined flight path over Gotenba, Mishima, Numazu, Atami, Odawara and Minamiashigara.  
真希波双手放在键盘和鼠标上，调整了一下他的角质眼镜，仔细检查屏幕上的每一张高分辨率图片；每张图片都是由侦察卫星上的 6000 万像素 CCD 数码相机拍摄的，以及安装在通用原子 MQ-1 掠夺者无人机无武装型号鼻部的传感器球上的 3000 万像素相机拍摄的；该无人机被编程为在御殿场、三岛、沼津、热海、小田原和南足柄上空飞预定的飞行路径。

As requested, Misato wanted full camera passes over the _Jietai_ (Self-Defense Force) formations that grew in strength for the past two weeks, to determine the actual composition of those forces, and to plan a contingency measure to deal with them, in the event should the government becomes hostile on NERV.  
如所要求，美里希望对过去两周内不断增强的自卫队（自卫队）部队进行全面的摄像侦察，以确定这些部队的实际构成，并制定应对措施，以防政府对 NERV 采取敌对行动。

Earlier in the mission, when one of the _Jietai_ generals called up directly and demanded as to why there was a Predator buzzing right on top of one of their divisions, Makoto coolly replied that they were conducting a harmless and legitimate photoreconnaissance survey for post-battle damage assessment, and he even presented two documents (by email attachment) that justified the flyover.  
在任务早期，当一位杰泰将军直接来电质问为何有一架捕食者无人机在他们一个师的上空盘旋时，真琴冷静地回答说他们正在进行一项无害且合法的战后损害评估摄影侦察，甚至还通过电子邮件附件展示了两个证明飞越合理性的文件。

Anyway, the pictures showed combat vehicles parked in formation, and some of them tallied with the inventory that was on the list which he earlier presented to Misato.  
无论如何，照片显示了排列整齐的战斗车辆，其中一些与之前他向美里展示的清单上的库存相符。

Satisfied, he nodded to the other officer and said, "I think it doesn't hurt if it's okay to make a copy, right?"  
满意地点了点头，他对另一位军官说：“我想，如果可以的话，复制一份应该无伤大雅，对吧？”

The OIC nodded. "No problem, Hyuga, and anything we can do to help your boss. You're okay to copy."  
OIC 点了点头。“没问题，日向，我们会尽力协助你的上司。你可以复制。”

"Thanks," Makoto replied as he plugged the USB flash drive into the port and began copying the photos, and then he pulled out his mobile phone and dialed Misato's number. No more than ten seconds she received the call.  
“谢谢，”真琴回答着，将 U 盘插入端口开始复制照片，随后掏出手机拨通了美里号码。不到十秒她就接了电话。

"It's me, so how things are going?" Misato asked.  
“是我，情况怎么样？”美里问道。

"I got them," Makoto answered. "Copying them right now."  
"我拿到了，" 真琴回答道。"正在复制中。"

"And how they're holding up?"  
"他们情况如何？"

Makoto sighed. "Buildup's getting heavier as we speak. They've added MLRS and 102mm howitzer batteries, along with a few ECM and commo trucks." He was referring to Multiple-Launch Rocket System tracked missile launchers, howitzers, and trucks bearing electronic countermeasures and communication equipment.  
真琴叹了口气。"正如我们所说，压力越来越大了。他们增加了多管火箭炮系统和 102 毫米榴弹炮阵地，还有几辆电子对抗和通信卡车。" 他指的是多管火箭炮系统履带式导弹发射器、榴弹炮以及搭载电子对抗和通信设备的卡车。

"Looks like they're getting real serious about us, huh?"  
"看来他们对我们认真起来了，是吧？"

"Oh, sure," he said, "But, did I just heard someone with you?" Makoto noted that he could hear some other voices in the background.  
""哦，当然，"" 他说，""不过，我刚才是不是听到你旁边有人？"" 真嗣注意到他可以听到背景中其他人的声音。

"Yeah, it's Shinji and Asuka, they're dressed up and having a bit of a grooming issue," Misato confirmed. "We're going to the O-Club."  
"是的，是真嗣和明日香，他们打扮好了，正有点打扮上的小问题，"" 美里确认道，""我们要去 O 俱乐部。"

Makoto chuckled. "Oh, I forgot," he replied. "Guess I'll have to change into civvies." _Civvies_ meant wearing civilian clothing.  
真嗣轻笑一声。“哦，我忘了，”他回答道，“看来我得换上便装了。”便装指的是穿平民服装。

"Good, 'cause for tonight let's drop work, hang out there and relax," Misato said. "Have you eaten already?"  
“太好了，因为今晚我们放下工作，去那里放松一下吧，”美里说，“你已经吃过饭了吗？”

"Yeah. Had yakudon while watching the recon guys do their stuff."  
“嗯，边看侦察人员忙活边吃了牛肉盖饭。”

"Can you still hold your drink?"  
"你还能喝吗？"

"Probably," Makoto said, feeling unsure. "It's been about… what? There's a month since the last time I had my bottle of beer."  
"大概吧，" 真琴说，心里不太确定。"已经过去……多久了？上次喝啤酒是一个月前的事了。"

"That's not a problem. I'll see you bridge guys later, okay?"  
"那没问题。回头见，桥上的朋友们，好吗？"

Makoto grinned. "Okay, later, Misato. Thanks."  
真琴咧嘴一笑。“好的，再见，美里。谢谢。”

"Thank you, too." She then hung up.  
“也谢谢你。”她说完挂了电话。

As he pocketed the phone, Makoto sighed and wondered whom he wanted to dance with. Was it Misumi Kuroda, the girl manning the workstation just below him, close to Casper? Or Sheryl Yuen, working at Records and whom he sometimes talked to while borrowing a folder or two. He also thought of what to wear, too; maybe a good shirt and a pair of jeans would cut it.  
他把手机放进口袋，叹了口气，思索着想和谁跳舞。是就在他下面工作站的女孩三岛黑田，靠近卡斯帕的地方吗？还是档案室的雪儿·袁，他有时借一两个文件夹时会和她聊上几句。他还考虑着该穿什么；或许一件好衬衫和一条牛仔裤就足够了。

No, perhaps maybe he could ask Misato even for a little dance, for the sake of unrequited love.  
不，或许他可以邀请美里跳一支舞，哪怕是为了那无果的爱。

In his own miniscule room, a few doors away from Misato's quarters, Kaworu Nagisa was in front of the mirror, finished buttoning up his microfiber black shirt over a white cotton t-shirt. He was also wearing a pair of light-green pants and the same white sneakers that were issued to him prior to his departure. Kaworu also guessed that by now, Rei was done showering, and probably wearing the civilian clothes that Asuka had lent to her.  
在自己的小房间里，离美里的住处几扇门之遥，渚薰站在镜子前，刚刚扣好他的微纤维黑色衬衫，里面是一件白色棉质 T 恤。他还穿着一条浅绿色裤子和一双白色运动鞋，这双鞋是在他出发前配发给他的。渚薰猜测，此刻绫波应该已经洗完澡了，可能正穿着惣流借给她的便服。

Just then Rei walked in with towel in hand, and a plastic bag containing her school uniform and Kaworu's toiletries, and hung both on the hat rack just behind the door. She was wearing a white baby t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans and her usual white plimsoll shoes.  
就在这时，绫波手里拿着毛巾走了进来，手里还提着一个塑料袋，里面装着她的校服和渚薰的洗漱用品，她把这两样东西挂在了门后的衣帽架上。她穿着一件白色小 T 恤，一条蓝色牛仔裤和平时常穿的白色帆布鞋。

"Oh, that was fast," Kaworu noted.  
"哦，真快啊," 渚薰注意到。

"I did not bother too much about personal appearances," Rei said. "Girls in my school tend to do so, worrying about their faces."  
"我并不太在意个人外表，" 绫波零说。"我们学校的女生往往如此，担心自己的脸。"

"Pimples, right?" "青春痘，对吧？"

"Yes," Rei confirmed, before she went over to Kaworu and straightened out his collar and sleeves with her hands.  
“是的，”丽确认道，随后她走到薰身边，用手整理他的衣领和袖口。

"Now you're doing this just like a mother," he remarked.  
“你现在这么做简直像个母亲，”他评论道。

Rei smiled. "I know. It is now my instinct."  
丽微笑着。“我知道。这已经成了我的本能。”

---

"You're okay with that?" Asuka questioned Shinji as she combed her hair right in front of the mirror. She could also hear Misato showering in the bathroom, humming to a song that she didn't know; probably an old _enka_  
"你没意见吗？" 明日香一边在镜子前梳着头发，一边问真嗣。她还能听到美里在浴室里洗澡，哼着一首她不熟悉的歌；可能是首老式演歌。

song.

The Second Children was wearing a pink camisole and a long-sleeved cashmere sweater of the same color, a white miniskirt and a pair of low-profile Sketchers, while the Third Children had put on a black Uniqlo t-shirt, blue jeans and Adidas sneakers.  
二号机驾驶员穿着一件粉色的吊带背心和同色的长袖羊绒衫，一条白色迷你裙和一双低帮的斯凯奇鞋，而三号机驾驶员则穿了一件黑色的优衣库 T 恤，蓝色牛仔裤和阿迪达斯运动鞋。

"Yeah," Shinji answered. "I feel comfortable wearing them, and Misato said 'casuals', isn't it?"  
"嗯，" 真嗣回答道。"我觉得穿这些挺舒服的，而且美里不是说'休闲装'吗？"

Now Asuka sprayed herself with a bottle of Nenuco, a popular Spanish baby cologne brand. "Want some of my cologne?" she offered.  
现在，明日香正用一瓶西班牙流行的婴儿香水品牌 Nenuco 往自己身上喷。“想试试我的香水吗？”她提议道。

Shinji sniffed, figured the scent seemed refreshing, but he shook his head. "No, it's okay."  
真嗣嗅了嗅，觉得这香味似乎很清新，但他还是摇了摇头。“不用了，谢谢。”

"C'mon, just try it," Asuka badgered. "It's unisex."  
“来吧，就试一下，”明日香怂恿道，“这是中性香。”

"What does that mean?"  
"那是什么意思？"

"Dummy dear, it means that either boys or girls can wear it."  
"傻瓜，亲爱的，这意味着男孩和女孩都可以穿。"

Shinji nodded. "Oh… Okay," he agreed before she began to spray his neck and collar.  
真嗣点点头。"哦…好的，"他同意后，她开始往他的脖子和衣领上喷洒。

After toweling, then dressing up in a blue skirt, a white camisole topped over with a yellow blouse, Misato picked up her mobile phone sitting on the edge of the wash basin and dialed Fuyutsuki's number. The elderly Sub-Commander picked up after a few rings.  
擦干身体后，美里穿上蓝色裙子，白色吊带衫外搭黄色衬衫，随后拿起洗手台边缘的手机，拨通了冬月副司令的号码。几声铃响后，这位年长的副司令接起了电话。

"Yes?" Fuyutsuki asked. “喂？”冬月问道。

"It's me again, sir. Just a change of venue," Misato answered.  
“是我，长官。只是换个地点，”美里回答道。

"Where?"

"At the O-Club, so I'll bring a laptop instead."  
"在 O-Club，所以我带个笔记本电脑去。"

"I see. Guess I'll have to dress up, then. Why there?"  
"明白了。那我得打扮一下了。为什么选那里？"

"Almost everyone wanted to go 'cause they got promoted."  
"几乎每个人都想去，因为他们升职了。"

Fuyutsuki chuckled. "I forgot. It's perfectly all right for you people to let off some steam and enjoy yourselves. Okay, I'll see you later there instead."  
冬月轻笑一声。“我忘了。你们这些人放松一下，享受自己，完全没问题。好吧，那我晚点在那儿见你。”

Misato nodded. "Thank you, sir. We'll have to go now," she said, before disconnecting. The woman then sighed, picked up a hairbrush and said, "Sometimes I have to mix business with pleasure."  
美里点头道：“谢谢您，长官。我们得走了。”说完便挂断了电话。她叹了口气，拿起一把梳子说：“有时候我得把工作和娱乐结合起来。”

Like any military or scientific installation almost far from civilization, NERV HQ was built to be entirely self-sufficient, making it resemble effectively as a small town: apart from laboratories and research facilities, it also boasted of quarters for both permanent personnel and visitors, cafeterias and restaurants, a stockade, bathhouses and swimming pools, a pair of convenience stores (the world's lowest Lawson's branches), a bank, a movie house, chapels, temples and a mosque, a full sports complex, a huge library, a heliport, a geothermal power plant, farms, gardens and a park, and of course, the Officers' Club, the Non-Commissioned Officers' (NCO) Club, and the Enlisted Men's (EM) Club.  
像远离文明的任何军事或科研设施一样，NERV 总部被设计成完全自给自足，实际上就像一个小城镇：除了实验室和研究设施外，还有供常驻人员和访客居住的宿舍、食堂和餐馆、围栏、澡堂和游泳池、两家便利店（全球最低的罗森分店）、一家银行、一家电影院、教堂、寺庙和清真寺、一个完整的体育综合体、一个巨大的图书馆、一个直升机停机坪、一个地热发电厂、农场、花园和一个公园，当然还有军官俱乐部、士官俱乐部和士兵俱乐部。

The three dives, sited just near the linear train station (and far enough from the main HQ pyramid, following the "out of sight, out of mind" dictum), were suggested by some American personnel years ago, who were employed early in the history of the organization, as they felt it was difficult and time-consuming back then to go all the way up to the ground to enjoy the Hakone night life. Patterned after their military forebears, these nightclubs had their own stock of booze, skilled bartenders, in-house bands, and bouncers (who were really volunteers from the security brigades).  
这三家潜水酒吧，就坐落在直线列车站附近（且远离总部主金字塔，遵循着“眼不见，心不烦”的原则），是由多年前一些美国员工提议设立的。这些员工在组织早期便已受雇，他们觉得当时要一路爬到地面才能享受箱根的夜生活既困难又耗时。这些夜店模仿了他们的军方前辈，拥有自己的酒水库存、技艺高超的调酒师、驻场乐队和保镖（实际上是来自安全部队的志愿者）。

Unlike their civilian counterparts outside the fence, there were no blond-haired hostesses hanging around and certainly no costly Ladies' Drinks to pay for; each patron is limited to at least eight bottles or cans, or until visibly inebriated and must be asked to leave; and these dives all closed at one in the morning.  
与围墙外的平民夜店不同，这里没有金发女招待徘徊，当然也没有昂贵的女士饮品需要支付；每位顾客限饮至少八瓶或罐装酒，或直到明显醉酒必须被要求离开；这些潜水酒吧都在凌晨一点关门。

At the moment, Team Eva was standing right before the O-Club's two-story façade, its sign flashing brightly in neon tubing as throngs of off-duty personnel, some of them parking their bicycles on the racks, approached the doors and let the volunteer bouncers check them out before they were admitted inside. The air in the Geofront was also cool, the 320 giant ventilators above their heads blowing in fresh December air from the outside.  
此刻，EVA 小队正站在 O-Club 的双层立面前，霓虹灯管闪烁的招牌下，大批下班人员涌向门口，有些人将自行车停放在架子上，等待志愿者保安检查后才被允许进入。地底空间的空气同样凉爽，头顶上方 320 台巨型通风机正吹送着来自外界的十二月新鲜空气。

Before they left their quarters, apart from locking the doors, Misato wrapped Kaji's box in the same plastic bag used for transport, and then hid it in the closet. She also reminded the night duty attendant to let no one enter their quarters without her explicit permission.  
在他们离开宿舍前，除了锁门，美里还将加持的盒子用同样的塑料袋包裹好，然后藏进了衣柜。她还提醒夜班管理员，未经她明确许可，不得让任何人进入他们的宿舍。

"Well?" Misato asked the Children, who felt like blinking initiates to an unknown inner sanctum, in varying degrees of unease and uncertainty. The woman, with her laptop (and Kaji's SD card still slotted in) in its bag and hanging from her shoulder, noted their speechlessness. She then sighed and said, "Don't worry, if you couldn't understand something, ask me as I know things like these like the back of my hand."  
“嗯？”美里问那些孩子们，他们感觉自己像是初入未知圣地的见习者，带着不同程度的紧张和不确定。这位女士肩上挂着装有笔记本电脑（以及仍插着加持 SD 卡）的包，注意到他们的沉默。她叹了口气，然后说：“别担心，如果有什么不懂的，尽管问我，我对这些事情了如指掌。”

"Okay," Shinji said, his hand holding Asuka's.  
“好的，”真嗣说道，手握着明日香的手。

"So, what else I'm gonna expect inside?" the redhead asked, her pink purse dangling from the shoulder. While on their way to the pub, Asuka had explained to Rei about the purpose of the purse, which was to keep in her personal belongings such as money, debit and ID cards, favorite makeup and a phone. To be honest, she was enjoying the role being a tutor to Rei in everything she knew about normal teenage life.  
“那么，里面还会有什么呢？”红发的女孩问道，粉色的手提包从肩上垂下。在去酒吧的路上，明日香向丽解释了这个手提包的用途，用来存放她的个人物品，比如钱、银行卡和身份证、喜欢的化妆品以及手机。说实话，她很享受在日常生活中担任丽的导师的角色。

"Apart from the drinks, which there are some non-alcoholic stuff," Misato continued explaining, "if you want to, anyone can dance and request a song, sing karaoke, play an instrument, recite some poetry, or do some stand-up or _rakugo_ comedy. There's also foosball, air hockey, a UFO Catcher, darts, a _purikura_ booth, pool, arcade machines… Well, this is where everyone lets their hair down; name it, it has everything."  
“除了饮料，这里也有一些不含酒精的选项，”美里继续解释道，“如果你想的话，任何人都可以跳舞、点歌、唱卡拉 OK、演奏乐器、朗诵诗歌，或者表演单口喜剧和落语。还有桌上足球、空气曲棍球、抓娃娃机、飞镖、拍贴机、台球、街机游戏……这里就是大家放松的地方；应有尽有，你想要的都有。”

"Ah, I see," Rei said, nodding.  
"啊，我明白了。" 丽点点头说。

"Quite interesting," Kaworu remarked.  
"相当有趣。" 渚评论道。

"All right, guys, let's get in," Misato finally ordered, "and don't worry about the bouncers; they're friendly 'cause I know them and I hope they know who you are."  
"好了，伙计们，我们进去吧，" 美里最终下令道，"别担心那些保镖；他们很友好，因为我认识他们，也希望他们认识你们。"

The two bouncers were tall and beefy as wrestlers, and were clad in black t-shirts and jeans. As they walked towards the door, one of them upraised his hand and greeted in a baritone voice: "Colonel, good evening."  
两位保镖高大魁梧，宛如摔跤手一般，身着黑色 T 恤和牛仔裤。他们走向门口时，其中一人举起手，用低沉的声音问候道：“上校，晚上好。”

"Good evening, Lieutenant," Misato replied, for she knew the bouncer's cuff rank as she frequently patronized the pub, mostly in her earlier days of her Tokyo-3 assignment.  
“晚上好，中尉。”美里回答道，因为她经常光顾这家酒吧，尤其是在她刚被派到第三新东京市的时候，所以知道这位保镖的袖标军衔。

"Why them?" the bouncer asked, pointing out at the Children.  
“为什么是他们？”保镖问道，指向了孩子们。

"They're under my command."  
"他们归我指挥。"

The bouncer looked worried. "Ah, the Eva pilots… But this is an over-twenty hootch, Colonel Katsuragi. We're not supposed to serve stiff booze and brew to minors," he warned.  
保镖看起来很担忧。“啊，是 EVA 驾驶员们……但这可是二十一禁的酒吧，葛城美里上校。我们不应该向未成年人提供烈酒和啤酒。”他警告道。

"But we do have some non-alcoholic drinks, right?" Misato questioned.  
“但我们有不含酒精的饮料，对吧？”美里问道。

"Yeah, ma'am," the bouncer confirmed.  
"是的，女士，"保镖确认道。

"And minors can be supervised by a guardian, is it correct?"  
"未成年人可以由监护人陪同，对吗？"

"That's an affirmative."  
"没错。"

"Finally, is there a non-smoking section?"  
"终于，有没有禁烟区？"

"Sure, no problem, ma'am. It's to the left of the stage."  
"当然，没问题，女士。在舞台的左边。"

Misato sighed in pleasure. "Well then, that settles everything. Thank you."  
美里满足地叹了口气。"那么，一切都解决了。谢谢你。"

In approval, the bouncers nodded and grinned like Cheshire Cats. "All of you are in. Welcome to the O-Club and have a nice evening," they both greeted and then ushered them through the doors.  
保安们点头同意，咧嘴笑着如同柴郡猫。“你们都可以进来。欢迎来到 O 俱乐部，祝你们晚上愉快，”他们齐声欢迎，随后引导他们穿过门扉。

Once inside, they were quite surprised just how big it really looked than on the outside, with NERV memorabilia and framed pictures nailed and tacked onto the walls, along with Christmas decorations festooned about; and at the moment, an impromptu jazz band onstage was playing a Louis Armstrong number; besides the door a bunch of Aussies were crowded around the foosball table, swilling their beer and cheering; two men were quietly playing chess on one table and sharing a bottle of Jack Daniel's, while there was a British group playing darts; a posse of Americans were gathered around the pool table, swilling from bottles of Budweiser; some patrons were engaged at the arcade consoles, playing fighting games. The atmosphere was redolent with some hint of cigarette smoke, but completely saturated with the cacophony of music, loud talking and mobile phone ringtones.  
一进门，他们便惊讶于内部比外面看起来要大得多，墙上钉着 NERV 的纪念品和装裱的照片，还有圣诞装饰点缀其间；此刻，临时组成的爵士乐队正在台上演绎路易斯·阿姆斯特朗的曲目；门口一群澳大利亚人围在桌上足球旁，喝着啤酒，欢呼雀跃；两位男士在一旁安静地下着国际象棋，共享一瓶杰克丹尼；一群英国人在玩飞镖；一群美国人围在台球桌旁，喝着百威啤酒；有些顾客则在街机前玩着格斗游戏。空气中弥漫着一丝香烟的气息，但完全被音乐的喧嚣、高声交谈和手机铃声所淹没。

On the right side of the stage was the bar, stocked with every bottle of booze from floor to ceiling, and the bartender and his assistant were busy serving drinks to thirsty patrons, the taps flowing with beer, filling up mugs with the golden nectar.  
舞台右侧是吧台，从地板到天花板堆满了各式酒瓶，调酒师和他的助手正忙着为口渴的顾客调酒，啤酒从龙头源源不断地流出，金黄色的琼浆玉液注满了一个个酒杯。

Misato led the Children to their table, fortunately with no one else occupying it, and they sat on the cushy seats. Each table, covered in white linen, had a small lit candle, salt and pepper shakers, a napkin holder in the middle, and four copies of the menu. She then laid down the laptop bag, picked up one of the menu cards lying on the table, and asked amiably, "Do you have anything to order? A drink perhaps to kick off things?"  
美里领着孩子们来到他们的桌子旁，幸运的是没有其他人占用，他们坐在柔软的座椅上。每张覆盖着白色亚麻布的桌子上都点着一支小蜡烛，摆放着盐和胡椒瓶，中间是一个餐巾架，还有四份菜单。她随后放下笔记本电脑包，拿起桌上的一张菜单卡片，亲切地问道：“你们要点些什么吗？或许来杯饮料开个头？”

Kaworu and Rei, being completely unaccustomed to their new surroundings, merely shrugged, but Shinji and Asuka were both of them reading off the list on the menu.  
真嗣和明日香都在仔细阅读菜单上的列表，而完全不习惯新环境的渚薰和绫波则只是耸了耸肩。

"I'm gonna be okay with a Shirley Temple," Asuka said. "No, make that two; one for me, and another for Rei."  
"我要一杯雪莉坦普尔就好，" 明日香说，"不，来两杯吧；一杯给我，另一杯给丽。"

"I'd like a root beer float," Shinji said, looking up.  
"我想要一杯根啤浮冰，" 真嗣抬头说道。"

Misato turned her attention to the other Children. "Kaworu, do you want something?"  
美里转向其他孩子们。" 薰，你想要点什么？"

Kaworu nodded. "Oh, I'll take what Shinji wants, and I'd like to try it."  
渚薰点头。“哦，我会点真嗣想要的，我也想试试。”

"Great," Misato said cheerfully with an upraised hand to catch a passing waiter's attention. One of those waiters saw her and approached, then asked what she was ordering, and heard her request, including a tall Guinness for herself. Once done the waiter headed off to the direction of the bar.  
“太好了，”美里高兴地举手示意路过的服务员。其中一位服务员看到了她，走过来询问她要点什么，听完她的要求，包括为自己点了一杯高高的健力士啤酒。点完后，服务员便朝吧台方向走去。

Just then the band finished their number, walked off the stage, and the lights were dimmed. In their place and further up the stage, a black DJ wearing a Marc Ecko shirt took over with his turntable and mixer, put on a Paul Van Dyk track, and with a microphone began to make his introduction: "Good evening, people! This is DJ Les and welcome to the O-Club! Are you having a great time tonight?"  
就在这时，乐队结束了他们的表演，走下舞台，灯光也随之调暗。取而代之的是，一位身穿马克·埃科衬衫的黑人 DJ 带着他的唱盘和混音器走上舞台，播放了一首保罗·范·戴克的曲子，并拿起麦克风开始自我介绍：“大家晚上好！我是 DJ 莱斯，欢迎来到 O-Club！今晚玩得开心吗？”

The crowd responded with a resounding "Yeah!" in several languages.  
人群以多种语言响亮地回应：“耶！”

"Word has reached me that we have some special guests tonight. Know who they are?"  
“我听说今晚我们有几位特别的嘉宾。知道他们是谁吗？”

Cheers erupted, the throng anxiously demanding to know.  
欢呼声爆发，人群急切地追问着。

"WE GOT 'EM CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE!" DJ Les declared.  
“我们这儿有孩子们到场了！”DJ Les 宣布道。

Suddenly the spotlight was trained upon Team Eva's table and this time louder cheers and whistles came from the crowd, applauding their presence. All four Children were bewildered and blushing furiously at first, not expecting to have this much homage given to them, but Misato was laughing loudly.  
突然间，聚光灯打在了 EVA 小队的桌上，人群中爆发出更响亮的欢呼和口哨声，为他们的到来鼓掌。四名孩子们起初都感到困惑和脸红，没想到会受到如此多的敬意，但美里却大声笑了起来。

Realizing that their celebrity status had just hit them, Asuka waved her hand and grinned. She then turned to Shinji, who was visibly blinking amidst the spotlight, and asked, "Aren't you glad we're the life of the party?"  
意识到他们的名人地位刚刚降临，明日香挥了挥手，咧嘴一笑。她随后转向在聚光灯下明显眨眼的真嗣，问道：“你是不是很高兴我们成了派对的焦点？”

"Uh…" Shinji mumbled, not sure how to react.  
“呃…” 真嗣咕哝着，不知该如何反应。

Instead Asuka shook her head and laughed at the wary boy.  
相反，明日香摇了摇头，对着警惕的男孩笑了起来。

On the other hand, Kaworu simply shrugged, but Rei, in apparent disbelief, blinked twice.  
另一方面，渚只是耸了耸肩，但丽显然难以置信地眨了两下眼睛。

"Guess we'll have to wave our hands, just to tell them we're okay with them," he suggested, before they all waved their hands, to the delight of the throng.  
"看来我们得挥挥手，告诉他们我们没意见了，"他提议道，随后他们一起挥手，引得人群一阵欢呼。

"Now that they're here to bless this night," DJ Les exclaimed, "Why don't we start things with some party pumpers from the Nineties?" The patrons roared in approval when the DJ laid in a track from Naughty by Nature, diverting their attention away from the Children, and just in time the waiter finally arrived with their drinks on a tray.  
"既然他们来为今晚祈福，"DJ Les 高声说道，"不如我们就从九十年代的派对热曲开始吧？"当 DJ 播放起 Naughty by Nature 的歌曲时，顾客们爆发出热烈的掌声，注意力从孩子们身上转移开，恰在这时，服务员终于端着他们的饮品来到了桌前。

"Okay… Two Shirley Temples for the ladies," the waiter said as he set the non-alcoholic cocktails from his tray and onto the table; both glasses held a dark orange liquid with ice and a maraschino cherry, along with an orange slice for garnish.  
"好的……两杯雪莉神殿给女士们，"服务员说着，将托盘上的无酒精鸡尾酒摆到桌上；每杯都是深橙色的液体，内含冰块和一颗马拉斯奇诺樱桃，以及一片橙片作为装饰。

"Thank you," Asuka said while Rei nodded. The First Children, curious about the cocktail presented before her, began to eye its contents.  
"谢谢你，" 明日香说道，而绫波点点头。这两位第一适格者，对面前呈现的鸡尾酒感到好奇，开始打量其内容。

Still upbeat. the waiter grinned. "For you two guys, here's your root beer floats, all nicely done," he said, setting the filled mugs in front of Shinji and Kaworu.  
服务员依旧兴致勃勃地笑着。"给你们两位，这是你们的根啤漂浮，做得非常完美，" 他说着，将装满的杯子放在真嗣和薰面前。

"Much thanks," Shinji said.  
"非常感谢，" 真嗣说道。

"This looks… interesting, but thanks," Kaworu added as he hefted and inspected his mug, which was filled almost to the brim with A&W, and the last inch topped off with whipped cream.  
"这看起来…挺有意思的，不过还是谢谢了，" 渚薰一边说着，一边举起并仔细检查他的杯子，里面几乎盛满了 A&W 饮料，最上面一寸还覆盖着一层鲜奶油。

"And to the Colonel," the waiter finally said as he placed the tall, frosted mug of Guinness Stout right before Misato.  
"为上校干杯，" 服务员终于说道，他将那杯高高的、冰镇过的吉尼斯黑啤酒放在美里面前。

"Oh, thank you," Misato said, beaming and then she handed the waiter his tip of a 500-yen bill.  
"哦，谢谢你，" 美里笑着说，随后递给服务员一张 500 日元的纸币作为小费。

The waiter nodded in satisfaction and said, "My pleasure. Enjoy your evening." He then left them alone, now allowing them privacy for themselves.  
服务员满意地点点头，说道：“这是我的荣幸。祝您晚上愉快。”随后他便离开了，让他们独享这份私密时光。

"So, this is what a night-out looks like," Shinji commented.  
“所以，这就是夜生活的样子，”真嗣评论道。

"Yeah," Asuka agreed. "What do you think?"  
“是啊，”明日香附和道，“你觉得怎么样？”

Shinji nodded. "Cool. My first time, really."  
真嗣点点头。"酷。真的是第一次。"

"So do we," Kaworu added as Rei nodded. "Never been in a place like this before," he said.  
"我们也是，"渚薰补充道，绫波点点头。"从未到过这样的地方，"他说。"

"Okay, guys… I'll teach you a bit of etiquette when hanging out right in a joint like this," Misato finally spoke. "First, just before we raise our glasses, say _kampai_ and take the first drink, what do you wish for?" she asked them all.  
"好了，伙计们……我教你们在这种地方聚会的基本礼仪，"美里终于开口了。"首先，在我们举杯之前，说一声干杯并喝第一口酒时，你们有什么愿望？"她问大家。"

The Children were now quizzing themselves as to what they wanted, before Kaworu was the first to answer: "To an uninterrupted friendship," he said, raising his mug.  
孩子们正在互相询问他们想要什么，这时渚薰第一个回答：“为了不间断的友谊。”他举起杯子说道。

In imitation of her boyfriend, Rei softly smiled as she lifted her glass and said, "To my brother, and to my love."  
模仿着她的男朋友，绫波零轻轻地微笑着举起她的杯子说：“为了我的兄弟，也为了我的爱。”

"Thank you, Ayanami," Shinji said, nodding, before he turned his attention to Kaworu. "Congratulations, Nagisa."  
“谢谢你，绫波。”真嗣点头说道，然后转向渚薰。“恭喜你，渚。”

"I promise, I'll take good care of her," Kaworu avowed before he chuckled.  
"我保证，我会好好照顾她的，" 渚薰断言后轻声笑了起来。

Asuka sighed and hoisted her glass, but said pleasantly, "This one's for Mama."  
明日香叹了口气，举起她的酒杯，但语气愉快地说："这一杯敬妈妈。"

Misato nodded, holding up her mug. "To Kaji, his kisses and his cache-o-truth… and what about you, Shinji?"  
美里点头，举起她的啤酒杯。"敬加持，他的吻和他的真相宝库……你呢，真嗣？"

Shinji blinked. "Me?"

"Yeah. Got an idea?"

'Oh," the young man blurted. "Okay… This one's for all of you, to peace… and to Mother," he wistfully said, now holding his mug aloft.  
“哦，”年轻人脱口而出。“好吧……这一杯，为你们所有人，为和平……也为母亲，”他感慨地说着，此刻高举起手中的酒杯。

And Misato declared, _"Kampai!"_ as their glasses clanked in mid-air, before they drank.  
随后，美里宣布：“干杯！”他们的杯子在空中叮当作响，随即一饮而尽。

About ten meters away from their table, two men were sitting at a small table, dressed in sport shirts and jeans, swilling from their bottles of Kirin, smoking Mild Sevens, and popping wasabi peanuts into their mouths. One of them then whispered into the sleeve of his shirt, which had a small microphone pinned to, and said, "We're on station. Target's present and is right ahead of us."  
离他们的桌子大约十米远的地方，两个男人坐在一张小桌旁，身着运动衫和牛仔裤，从麒麟啤酒瓶中痛饮，抽着柔和的七星烟，嘴里还嚼着芥末花生。其中一人随后对着衬衫袖口低语，袖子上别着一个小麦克风，说道：“我们已就位。目标在场，就在我们前方。”

"Copy that. Keep an eye on them," the surveillance leader answered, in a British accent, through the first man's earphone. "Just don't get drunk," he warned. "We've got all night to do this."  
“收到。盯紧他们，”监视小组的领导用英式口音通过第一个人的耳机回答，“只是别喝醉了，”他警告道，“我们有整晚的时间来做这件事。”

The first man nodded. "Roger that, sir."  
第一个男人点点头，“明白，长官。”

Inside a nondescript Toyota service van, just fifty meters away from the O-Club, Deputy Director Morrissey adjusted his headphones and squinted at the flat-panel display that showed him the dive from the inside, through regular security and surveillance cameras. More than half of the van was filled with electronic gear dedicated to eavesdropping, and if needed can transmit and relay data to others within the command chain on a need-to-know basis. He then picked up his mobile phone and called Commander Ikari, who was watching their progress from his office.  
在一辆不起眼的丰田服务车里，距离 O-Club 仅五十米，副总监莫里西调整了一下耳机，眯起眼睛看着显示器上通过常规安保和监控摄像头传来的内部画面。车内超过一半的空间装满了用于窃听的电子设备，必要时可以按需向指挥链中的其他人传输和转发数据。随后，他拿起手机，拨通了正在办公室观察他们进展的池田指挥官的电话。

"We have some progress, Commander," Morrissey reported. "Nagisa is with the others, along with Colonel Katsuragi."  
"我们取得了一些进展，指挥官，"莫里西报告道。"渚和其余人在一起，还有葛城美里上校。"

"What are they doing?" Gendo asked, as the Englishman extended their video feed right into the Commander's computer. He then leaned forward to see what they were looking at.  
"他们在做什么？"源堂问道，与此同时，这位英国人将视频信号直接传到了指挥官的电脑上。他随即倾身向前，查看他们正在观看的内容。"

"Having cocktails, sir. Check out Camera 4, and there they are."  
"正在喝鸡尾酒，长官。请看 4 号摄像头，他们就在那里。"

Gendo nodded, but grimaced at the same time. "Very good, but you people must give me an hourly progress report. Is that clear?"  
源堂点了点头，但同时皱起了眉头。“非常好，但你们必须每小时向我汇报一次进度。清楚了吗？”

"That's an affirmative, Commander," Morrissey replied.  
“明白，指挥官，”莫里西回答道。

---

Gendo put down the phone on its cradle, and he stood up from his seat. He then paced around, thinking of the hours ahead. Everything was in place, as Morrissey had reported earlier, ready to follow Kaworu wherever he goes.  
源堂将电话放回底座，从座位上站起身来。他开始踱步，思考着接下来的几个小时。一切都已经就绪，正如莫里西之前报告的那样，准备随时跟随薰的行踪。

He'd already read the reports that were obtained from that boy's synchronization test just a few hours after he arrived, especially with Maya's summarization of what Kaworu was able to do: he was capable of manipulating his sync rate like so much tweaking the volume of a stereo.  
他已经在那男孩抵达后仅几个小时就阅读了从同步测试中获得的报告，尤其是玛雅对渚薰能力的总结：他能够像调节音响音量一样随意操控自己的同步率。

Of course, Gendo knew it was too amazing that Kaworu was already suspect, that he now concluded that the Committee sent him an _Angel,_ a wonderful gift with a deadly twist.  
当然，碇源堂知道这太不可思议了，渚薰早已引起怀疑，他现在断定委员会派来了一个天使，一个带有致命转折的美妙礼物。

And then he thought of what Rei was doing right now with him; she was supposed to report on his movements, but neglected to do so.  
然后他想到了绫波丽现在和他在一起的情况；她本应报告他的动向，却疏忽了这一点。

Then what was going on with that girl? What she was really doing with Kaworu?  
那么那个女孩到底在搞什么鬼？她和渚到底在做什么？

Gendo frowned, finally figuring out that they were probably having an affair, and was it a sign of her rebellion, betraying his trust he placed upon her? Was she trying to break away from him, cutting out the bonds that he established with Rei?  
碇源堂皱起眉头，终于意识到他们可能是在搞婚外情，这是她叛逆的迹象吗，背叛了他对她的信任？她是否试图挣脱他的束缚，切断他与绫波丽之间建立的纽带？

He then thought of the previous Rei who'd been very loyal and compliant to him, and he remembered the girl lowering her personal inhibitions whenever he came to her. True, he raised her, trained the girl personally, and tried to instill his personality as much as he could.  
他随即想起了之前的绫波丽，那个对他极其忠诚顺从的女孩，他记得每当他接近她时，她都会放下个人的戒备。确实，他培养了她，亲自训练这个女孩，并尽可能地灌输自己的性格。

Gendo shook his head, as he realized that Rei, despite being the vessel that he intended to use to bring his wife back from the beyond, was still very much a teenager, struggling to learn the complexities of life at that stage of her life.  
源度摇了摇头，意识到尽管丽是他打算用来从彼岸带回妻子的容器，但她仍然是一个青少年，正努力学习那个年龄段生活的复杂性。

Sooner or later, however, in the next few hours he will bring to Rei the harsh meaning of the word _obedience_, and he had no qualms at taking Kaworu away, forcing that boy to serve his own purposes.  
然而，迟早在这几个小时内，他会向丽灌输“服从”这个词的残酷含义，并且他毫不犹豫地要带走渚薰，迫使那个男孩服务于自己的目的。

Even if it meant killing the Fifth Children by his own hand to fulfill the prophecies.  
即便这意味着要亲手杀死第五适格者以实现预言。

DJ Les was now playing a slow song from Boyz II Men - _On Bended Knee_ - on his turntable, thus softening the atmosphere in the pub and couples began to come down onto the dance floor. By then the Children and their guardian had imbibed their drinks almost halfway to empty. Kaworu and Rei both commented that they never drank something this delicious in their whole lives, a welcome and refreshing change.  
DJ Les 现在在他的唱盘上播放着 Boyz II Men 的慢歌《On Bended Knee》，使得酒吧的氛围变得柔和，情侣们开始步入舞池。那时，孩子们和他们的监护人已经喝掉了近半杯的饮料。渚薰和绫波零都评论说，他们一生中从未喝过如此美味的东西，这是一个受欢迎且令人耳目一新的变化。

But Asuka noted the white moustache of creamy foam on Kaworu's upper lip. "Hey, look at that, Kaworu," she remarked, giggling.  
但明日香注意到了渚薰上唇上的白色奶油泡沫胡须。“嘿，看看那个，渚薰，”她笑着说。

Kaworu blinked. "What?" 渚薰眨了眨眼。“什么？”

"You got a milk moustache," Asuka said as she took out a tiny mirror from her purse and showed his reflection in the mirror.  
"你沾上牛奶胡子了。" 明日香从包里掏出一个小镜子，将他的倒影展示给他看。

"Oh, I didn't know that," Kaworu exclaimed as he reached out to pick up a napkin and dabble his lip on it, and they all laughed, except for Rei, who could only daintily cover her mouth with a hand in light mirth.  
"哦，我都没注意到。" 渚薰惊呼一声，伸手拿起一张餐巾纸轻拭唇边，除了绫波丽，大家都笑了，她只能优雅地用手掩嘴，轻笑出声。

That act, however, didn't escape Asuka's gaze, and she leaned forward. "Hmmmm… I've never seen you do that, Wondergirl," she said.  
然而，这一举动并未逃过明日香的眼睛，她向前倾身。"嗯……我还没见过你这样呢，奇迹少女。" 她如此说道。

"I am amused," Rei answered, blushing and smiling lightly.  
"我感到有趣，" 丽回答道，脸颊泛红，轻笑了一下。

"You're laughing, Ayanami?" Shinji excitedly questioned as Asuka brought out her phone and snapped a picture of the First Children in smiles.  
"你在笑，绫波？" 真嗣兴奋地问道，与此同时，明日香拿出手机，咔嚓一声拍下了微笑中的第一适格者。

Rei nodded. "Yes."

The girl's admission brought applauses from her companions, before Asuka noted that the DJ was now playing a new song: Angela Aki's _This Love._  
女孩的坦白赢得了同伴们的掌声，随后明日香注意到 DJ 开始播放一首新歌：安室奈美惠的《This Love》。

"Shinji?" Asuka asked, tabling her half-full glass of Shirley Temple.  
"真嗣？" 明日香问道，将她那半满的雪莉酒杯搁在桌上。

The young man blinked. "Yeah?"  
年轻人眨了眨眼。"嗯？"

Asuka smiled. "Wanna come with me and dance?" she offered, pointing at the direction of the dance floor.  
明日香微笑着。"想和我一起去跳舞吗？"她提议道，指向舞池的方向。

"Sure," he answered and then took her hand as they rose from their seats and went off.  
“当然，”他回答道，随即牵起她的手，两人从座位上起身离开。

"Good luck, guys," Misato chimed as she watch them took their place among the other dancing couples. "Isn't it sweet?" she remarked to both Kaworu and Rei, who were fingering their drinks. "Want to join them?" Misato suggested.  
“祝你们好运，伙计们，”美里看着他们加入其他跳舞的情侣中，欢快地说道。“是不是很甜蜜？”她对正在摆弄饮料的薰和丽说道。“想加入他们吗？”美里提议道。

Rei and Kaworu looked at each other for a second, before he agreed. "Okay, if that's what you want," he said, and then he turned to Rei and asked, "Will you come with me?"  
丽和薰对视了一秒，然后他同意了。“好吧，如果你希望的话，”他说着，转向丽问道，“你愿意和我一起去吗？”

Rei nodded. "Yes."

This time the other couple slowly got up and left, Kaworu gracefully taking Rei's hand as they walked together towards the dance floor.  
这次另一对情侣缓缓起身离开，渚薰优雅地牵起绫波的手，一同走向舞池。

Left alone, Misato, teary-eyed, sighed and smiled in triumph, and at the same time having bittersweet feelings in her heart. "I wish you were here to see this, Kaji," she remarked, swallowing hard, before making another toast to her lover. "God, I'm so proud to be their guardian."  
独自一人，美里泪眼朦胧，叹息着露出胜利的微笑，心中却五味杂陈。“真希望你也能看到这一幕，加持，”她哽咽着说道，随即又向爱人举杯。“天啊，我真为他们感到骄傲，能成为他们的守护者。”

For the first time in years, Kozo Fuyutsuki wore a shirt under a brown jacket with elbow patches, and a pair of brown tweed pants. If he could remember correctly the last time he wore this ensemble (which was normally hanging in his closet, wrapped in plastic), it was eleven years ago, back when there was Gehirn, when Yui was in corporeal form, and he then worked as an assistant chief researcher. He tried to use his long-neglected bottle of Old Spice on the dresser, but to no avail the bottle had dried out over the years, forcing him to pass by Lawson's in the main HQ and bought a bottle of cheap aftershave.  
多年来，首次穿上了一件衬衫，外搭一件带有肘部补丁的棕色夹克，以及一条棕色花呢裤。如果他没记错的话，上一次穿这套（通常挂在衣橱里，用塑料包裹着）是在十一年前，那时还有 GEHIRN，唯还以实体存在，而他当时是一名助理首席研究员。他试图使用梳妆台上那瓶久未动过的 Old Spice，但瓶子早已干涸，无奈之下只好在总部的主楼里的罗森便利店买了一瓶廉价的须后水。

Now, once he entered the dimmed sanctum sanctorum of the O-Club, he breathed in and scanned the crowd around him, looking for Misato. Amidst the crowds, with the resident DJ playing a love song, he found her at the far side of the room, left of the stage.  
此刻，当他踏入昏暗的 O-Club 圣所时，他深吸一口气，环视四周，寻找着美里。在人群中，伴随着驻场 DJ 播放的情歌，他在房间的远端，舞台的左侧找到了她。

He walked up, squeezing himself through the crowd, and settled on the vacant seat that Misato offered to him.  
他挤过人群，走到美里身边，坐上了她为他留出的空位。

"Good evening, sir," Misato greeted. "I've never seen you wear something other than your usual uniform."  
“晚上好，先生，”美里问候道，“我从未见过你穿除了制服以外的衣服。”

"That's right," Fuyutsuki said. "Where are the Children?"  
“没错，”冬月说，“孩子们在哪里？”

Misato grinned. "Oh, they're dancing."  
美里咧嘴一笑。“哦，他们在跳舞。”

The elderly man sighed, saw the Children in two separate swaying couples, and said, "Well, well, well… they're now acting their age." He then chuckled. "No, make that _a coming of age._"  
老人叹了口气，看到孩子们分成两对摇摆起舞，说道：“哎呀呀，他们终于表现得像这个年纪了。”他随即轻笑一声，“不，应该说是成年了。”

'Sure they do, sir," she remarked.  
“当然有，先生，”她回答道。

"And I'll call that a case of healthy progress." He then pointed at the laptop, which was now up and running. "Do you have something for me?"  
“那我就称之为健康进展吧。”他随即指向已经启动的笔记本电脑，“你有什么要给我看的吗？”

"Of course, sir," Misato said as she turned the laptop around, facing Fuyutsuki. "Nagisa has just found much of Kaji's cache, in his garden."  
“当然，先生，”美里说着将笔记本电脑转向冬月，“渚刚刚在他的花园里发现了许多加持的藏品。”

Fuyutsuki blinked. "How?"

Misato explained that, acting on her request, Kaworu and Rei went over to Kaji's garden, weeded and watered his plants, and just before they were about to leave, Kaworu accidentally tripped over the box, pulled it out and brought it to her.  
美里解释说，根据她的请求，渚薰和绫波丽去了加持的花园，除草浇水，就在他们准备离开时，渚薰不小心绊倒了，拉出了那个箱子并带给了她。

"Where is it?" “它在哪儿？”

"I've left it in our quarters," Misato said, "but Kaji had also included a memory card with most of his files inside, so I brought it along with me."  
“我把它留在了我们的住处，”美里说，“但加持还附带了一张内存卡，里面有他大部分的文件，所以我把它也一起带来了。”

"I see. Can you show me what's inside?"  
"我明白了。你能给我看看里面是什么吗？"

Misato nodded, and opened one of the files. From his pocket, the old man took out his reading glasses and wore them, before he leaned forward to scrutinize closely and in minutes he was skimming each and every one of the files.  
美里点点头，打开了一个文件。老人从口袋里掏出他的老花镜戴上，然后身体前倾，仔细审视起来，没过几分钟，他就开始快速翻阅每一个文件。

"Where he managed to get all of this?" Fuyutsuki asked in an incredulous tone.  
"他是从哪儿弄到这些东西的？" 冬月用难以置信的语气问道。

"Only he knows," Misato replied. "What's necessary is that everything that we need is in there."  
“只有他知道，”美里回答，“重要的是我们需要的一切都在里面。”

Now Fuyutsuki was pondering, figuring out what to do with this stupendous hoard of data sitting right before him, and then he remembered how he tried to bring Gendo down, but that plan was foiled when he was offered the opportunity to work alongside him, out of the need to fulfill Yui's wishes.  
现在，冬月正在沉思，思考如何处理眼前这庞大的数据宝库，然后他想起了自己曾试图扳倒碇源堂，但那个计划在他被提供机会与他合作以实现唯的愿望时破灭了。

But to divulge these revelations right now… He wasn't sure if that was the right time to do so; if he did immediately, that meant risking his leadership, and he needed that leadership to maintain the cohesiveness of the entire organization.  
但此刻揭露这些真相……他不确定这是否是合适的时机；如果他立即这么做，那就意味着冒着失去领导地位的风险，而他需要这个领导地位来维持整个组织的凝聚力。

On the other hand, if he could plan and time it correctly, they could switch the table around and cause SEELE's monster to turn against those old men. But when?  
另一方面，如果他能计划并准确把握时机，他们就能调换桌子，让 SEELE 的怪物转而对付那些老头子。但何时动手呢？

"There's another thing I'd like to tell you, sir," Misato said, snapping him out of his thoughts.  
“还有件事我想告诉您，长官，”美里说道，打断了他的思绪。

"Pardon me?" Fuyutsuki questioned as he pocketed the glasses.  
“抱歉，你说什么？”富士津 uki 一边说着，一边将眼镜收进口袋。

"You may not believe me," Misato answered, indicating Rei dancing with Kaworu in the distance, "but… Rei now possesses the memories of Yui Ikari, Shinji's mother."  
“你可能不会相信，”美里回答，指着远处与渚薰共舞的绫波，“但……绫波现在拥有了碇唯，真嗣母亲的记忆。”

This time the elderly man's mouth gaped in total disbelief, as if he was solidly kicked in the rear. "How… How that happened?" he mumbled.  
这次老人的嘴巴张得大大的，完全不敢相信，仿佛被狠狠踢了一脚。“怎么……怎么会这样？”他喃喃自语。

Misato took a breath, and began to explain how Rei fainted at the mere sight of Yui's picture, fell into a strange trance, and then woke up to discover that she carried a secret past that Unit-01 had earlier implanted into her mind while it went out of control during the failed compatibility test.  
美里深吸一口气，开始解释绫波是如何在看到碇唯的照片时晕倒，陷入一种奇怪的恍惚状态，然后醒来发现自己承载了一个秘密的过去，那是初号机在失败的兼容性测试中失控时植入她脑海的。

"…and then Rei called Shinji her _brother_," Misato concluded.  
“…然后丽称真嗣为她的哥哥，”美里总结道。

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Brother?"

Misato smiled. "Cross my heart, but that's what she said. You said before that you and the Commander cloned her from Doctor Ikari's DNA, right?"  
美里微笑道：“我发誓，她确实是这么说的。你之前提到过，你和指挥官用碇博士的 DNA 克隆了她，对吧？”

"That's true," he confirmed.  
“没错，”他确认道。

"And that means, in genetic terms… Shinji and Rei are _siblings_."  
"而从遗传学的角度来看……这意味着真嗣和绫波是兄妹。"

The old man sighed and laughed. "Goodness, I never thought I'm living the day that the truth about these two will come in an unlikely way. Frankly, I would also like to see the reaction on Ikari's face if he ever finds out."  
老人叹了口气，笑了起来。"天哪，我从没想过自己会活到这一天，这两个孩子的真相会以如此意想不到的方式揭晓。老实说，我也想看看如果碇知道了会有什么反应。"

"That'll be interesting, sir… But, would you like to order a drink or something?" Misato offered, indicating her now-empty mug.  
"那一定会很有趣，先生……不过，您想点些喝的吗？"美里提议道，指了指自己已经空了的杯子。"

"Get me a tall Kirin," Fuyutsuki said, nodding. "We'll leave all other business for tomorrow, and make ourselves merry tonight, shall we?"  
“给我来杯高杯麒麟，”冬月说，点头示意。“我们把其他事务都留到明天，今晚就尽情欢乐，如何？”

"Okay, sir."

And just as Misato was about to stand up and leave for the bar, suddenly a group arrived right before their table: Makoto, Maya and Shigeru, Ritsuko, Tsutomo and Natsumi, then Trudy and Paul; the entire posse was dressed up for the occasion.  
正当美里准备起身去吧台时，突然一群人出现在他们桌前：真、麻耶和茂、律子、堤文和夏美，然后是特鲁迪和保罗；整个团队都盛装出席。

Ritsuko, wearing a blue dress and her hair dyed blonde once again, and being the highest-ranking officer in the group, gave a smile and said, "You're not alone, sir. Mind if we could join you?"  
律子身穿蓝色连衣裙，头发再次染成金色，作为团队中军衔最高的军官，她微笑着说：“您并不孤单，先生。介意我们加入吗？”

Color Me Badd's _Wildflower_ was now on the turntable, as Rei snuggled closer to Kaworu, his hands behind her back as they danced and rocked slowly, in imitation of the other couples doing the same thing.  
《Wildflower》by Color Me Badd 此刻正在唱片机上旋转，丽依偎在渚的身旁，双手环抱在她背后，两人缓缓摇摆着舞步，模仿着周围其他情侣的动作。

"I'm going to be very honest, Rei," Kaworu whispered, while he was cautious not to step onto Rei's feet.  
“丽，我要非常坦诚地说，”渚低声耳语，小心翼翼地避免踩到丽的脚。

"Yes?" Rei questioned. “嗯？”丽问道。

"It's my first time that I'm dancing, and my first time being here," he admitted.  
"这是我第一次跳舞，也是第一次来这里，"他坦白道。

Rei smiled. "This is also my first," she said.  
丽微笑着说："这也是我的第一次。"

Kaworu sighed. "It feels so good to experience something new, and there's a certain kind of magic of discovering these new things first-hand, rather than by merely reading them from a book or the TV."  
薰叹了口气："体验新鲜事物的感觉真好，亲自发现这些新奇之处的魔力，远胜于仅仅从书本或电视上读到它们。"

"You are right," Rei agreed.  
"你说得对，"丽同意道。

"Another thing that makes you amazing… it's the first time I heard you laugh, even if it's soft."  
"另一件让你了不起的事……这是我第一次听到你笑，尽管声音很轻。

"I did not know that I feel good once I was able to laugh," Rei answered.  
"我之前不知道笑出来会感觉这么好，"丽回答道。

Kaworu nodded. "That's true… and I just realized something."  
渚薰点头道：“确实如此……我刚刚意识到一件事。”

"What is it?" “什么事？”

"The secret to the tenacity of the lilim isn't just the mere acquisition and storage of knowledge," Kaworu said. "It's hope, the hope for the future, which is why they can rise and rebuild from the ashes after a cataclysm or war. It's what motivates them to live, to fight on, to make their dreams a reality. Even with love, many still hope to find it, like what's happening right now, and what we have found for ourselves."  
“莉莉姆坚韧不拔的秘密不仅仅在于知识的获取和储存，”渚薰说，“而是希望，对未来的希望，这正是他们能在灾难或战争后从灰烬中崛起并重建的原因。正是这种希望驱使他们活下去，继续战斗，将梦想变为现实。即使是在爱情中，许多人依然怀揣着找到它的希望，就像现在正在发生的，以及我们为自己找到的东西。”

"I think you are right in saying so," Rei said. "There is still hope for us."  
"我想你这么说没错，"丽说道，"我们仍有希望。"

"And with hope, we have nothing else to fear," Kaworu concluded.  
"有了希望，我们便无所畏惧，"渚薰总结道。"

On the other hand, Shinji and Asuka, in an embrace, were watching the other couple dance and whisper to each other, before they turned their attention to themselves, swaying while being careful not to bump into others.  
另一方面，真嗣和明日香相拥着，注视着另一对情侣翩翩起舞、窃窃私语，随后他们将注意力转向彼此，小心翼翼地摇摆，以免撞到旁人。

"Now they really hit it off," Asuka remarked. "Just look at them, and they're learning fast."  
“他们现在真是合得来，”明日香评论道，“看看他们，学得真快。”

Shinji snickered softly. "Uh, is there such a word called _reinvention_?"  
真嗣轻声笑了一下。“呃，有个词叫‘重塑’吗？”

Asuka nodded. "Yeah, if I'm correct, it means the radical change of something or somebody, in terms of appearance, presentation, form or function."  
明日香点头。“是的，如果我没记错的话，它指的是某物或某人在外观、呈现、形式或功能上的彻底改变。”

"Ah… Then Ayanami has reinvented herself."  
“啊……那么绫波已经重塑了自己。”

"Yeah," Asuka agreed, "and in a single week she went from a boring wallflower to a real person. That's for the books, yet to me she still hasn't changed the way she speaks."  
“是啊，”明日香同意道，“她在短短一周内从一个乏味的壁花变成了一个真正的人。这简直是传奇，但对我来说，她的说话方式还是没变。”

Shinji sighed and then said, "Ever since Kaworu came here, things have changed so much for the past few days, and it's quite fast, like a roller coaster ride."  
真嗣叹了口气，然后说道：“自从渚薰来到这里，过去几天里事情变化得太快了，就像坐过山车一样。”

"Uh-huh," Asuka murmured.

"But in the process, we discover who we really are, and what's our purpose being here."  
"但在这个过程中，我们发现了自己真正的身份，以及我们存在的目的。"

"That's _self-discovery_." "这就是自我发现。"

The Third Children grinned. "Oh, thanks… There's such a word, after all."  
第三适格者咧嘴一笑。 "哦，谢谢……原来还有这样一个词。"

"You're welcome for me to expand your vocabulary, my dummy Shinji," Asuka mocked.  
"你该感谢我帮你扩充词汇量，我的傻瓜真嗣，" 明日香嘲讽道。

This time both of them shook and laughed, before they almost quieted themselves down.  
这次两人都颤抖着笑了起来，随后他们几乎安静了下来。

"Know what?" Asuka whispered. "In my whole life I never danced in something like a prom."  
"知道吗？" 明日香低声说。"在我的一生中，我从未在像舞会这样的场合跳过舞。"

Shinji blinked. "A prom?"

"Yeah, a promenade is a school dance," Asuka clarified. "Just like the kind of dances you have on the night of a cultural festival in school, and in America they always have that event in their high schools, like the ones you see in the movies. It's a formal tradition, a kind of a rite of passage that they look forward to."  
"嗯，舞会是学校举办的舞蹈活动，" 明日香解释道，"就像你在学校文化节晚上看到的那种舞蹈，在美国，他们的高中总是举办这样的活动，就像电影里演的那样。这是一种正式的传统，一种他们期待已久的成人礼。"

"Really?"

"Uh-huh, and as far as I'm concerned, this one is close enough to a real prom, and we're not yet even sixteen years old."  
"嗯嗯，就我所知，这次的活动已经很接近真正的舞会了，而我们甚至还没满十六岁呢。"

---

Meanwhile the rest of Misato's crew had commandeered several empty tables and chairs, and then linked them together to form a long table. The waiter then delivered a full round of drinks among the group, including a hibachi to barbecue strips of marinated beef. They sat down, with Fuyutsuki being placed right at the head of this impromptu table as the patriarch of the "family".  
与此同时，美里的小队已经占领了几张空桌子和椅子，并将它们连接起来形成一张长桌。服务员随后为这群人送来了一轮饮料，包括一个用来烧烤腌牛肉条的铁板烧。他们坐了下来，其中冬月被安排在这张临时餐桌的首位，作为这个"家庭"的家长。

"Say, ma'am, those Children are now going steady?" Maya asked, being the consummate romantic, but she hasn't touched her beer. "Isn't that so sweet and romantic?"  
"说起来，女士，那些孩子们现在在交往吗？" 真希问道，她是个十足的浪漫主义者，但她的啤酒还没碰过。"这不是很甜蜜很浪漫吗？"

Misato nodded. "Damn right," she confirmed, pointing her finger at the dancing couples.  
美里点头。"没错，"她确认道，用手指着跳舞的情侣们。

"Whoa," Makoto awed as Maya giggled and blushed.  
"哇哦，" 真琴赞叹道，真希咯咯笑着，脸颊泛红。

"Never in a million years can this happen," Shigeru remarked. "Shinji and Asuka were, back then, like oil and water because we can't mix them."  
“一百万年也不可能发生这种事，” 四郎评论道。“那时真嗣和明日香就像油和水，根本无法融合。”

"That's right," Ritsuko agreed after a puff of her Mild Seven, tapping the cigarette on the rim of the ashtray. "But that's changed. They got the gist of who they really are."  
“没错，” 律子吸了一口她的万宝路后同意道，轻轻敲了敲烟头在烟灰缸边缘。“但情况变了。他们已经领悟到自己真正的身份。”

"And in growing up they also broke down the walls," Misato added before making another quaff of her beer.  
"“随着成长，他们也打破了隔阂，” 美里补充道，随即又喝了一大口啤酒。”

"Quite poetic, Colonel," Fuyutsuki said, nodding. "Where's Director Hamamoto?" he asked Tsutomo.  
"相当诗意啊，上校，" 冬月说，点头表示赞同。"滨元主任在哪里？" 他问津友。

"Still busy, sir," Tsutomo answered. "Usually neck-deep in paperwork."  
"还在忙，长官，" 津友回答。"通常是埋头于文件堆中。"

Fuyutsuki made a face. "Ah, I see… That's too bad, he should be here, enjoying himself."  
冬月皱了皱眉。"啊，我明白了……真可惜，他应该在这里，享受一下的。"

"But, on the other hand, we've conducted a full inspection of the arsenal. Every piece has been accounted for, all of them in good working condition."  
"但另一方面，我们已经对军械库进行了全面检查。每一件武器都已清点完毕，全部处于良好工作状态。"

"Very good," Fuyutsuki commended, "and Major, how's it going?"  
"很好，" 冬月称赞道，"少校，进展如何？"

Paul, his rank being mentioned, stood up and said, "Received a new ship, then Trudy and I made a test hop a few hours ago." He was referring to his new Cheyenne gunship. "She's smooth to the touch, sir."  
保罗，提到他的军衔，站起身来说："刚接收了一艘新飞船，然后特鲁迪和我几小时前进行了试飞。"他指的是他的新夏延武装直升机。"她操作起来非常顺畅，长官。"

Now the Children were coming, all four of them were in smiles as they walked back to their table, but were surprised to see that everyone had showed up, and they applauded.  
现在孩子们回来了，四个都面带笑容走向他们的桌子，却惊讶地发现所有人都已到齐，并为他们鼓掌。

"Oh, what's that for?" Asuka demanded in a rather lighthearted tone.  
“哦，这是为什么？”明日香带着几分轻松的语气问道。

"I think we really made them happy," Shinji answered as the Children sat down among their elder peers.  
“我想我们真的让他们很开心，”真嗣回答道，孩子们在年长的同伴中坐下。

Fuyutsuki, quite pleased with his people and their presence, stood up and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time for a toast, but first, let me speak."  
冬月，对自己的族人和他们的到场感到十分满意，站起身来说道：“女士们、先生们，我认为是时候举杯了，但首先，请允许我发言。”

Everyone nodded back at him, wanting to hear as they picked up their filled glasses and mugs, and stood up in unison.  
众人纷纷点头回应，拿起装满的酒杯和啤酒杯，齐刷刷地站了起来，期待着聆听。

"It's been a turbulent year for all of us, beginning with Shinji's first battle when he first came here, and we were able to meet that very first challenge of our lives. From there we witnessed triumph and tragedy, happiness and sadness, through hell and high water, and yet the one thing that kept us going is a very simple word, and that word is _hope_."  
“对我们所有人来说，这是动荡的一年，从真嗣第一次来到这里并参与战斗开始，我们便迎来了人生中的第一个重大挑战。从那时起，我们见证了胜利与悲剧，喜悦与悲伤，历经地狱般的考验和艰难险阻，然而支撑我们前行的，是一个极其简单的词，那就是希望。”

"Hear, hear," his audience intoned.  
“说得好，说得好，”他的听众附和道。

Fuyutsuki sighed, and he turned his attention to Shinji and Asuka. "To you two, it's been a very long way since the first time you saw each other, and at first you weren't able to get along, you have your faults, and we all thought you two weren't made for each other… But, Miss Langley, after you made the decision to stay, everything changed as you have discovered who you really were."  
冬月叹了口气，将注意力转向真嗣和明日香。“对你们两人来说，自从第一次见面以来已经走了很长的路，起初你们无法相处，你们都有自己的缺点，我们都以为你们俩并不适合彼此……但是，兰格雷小姐，自从你决定留下后，一切都变了，你已经发现了自己真正的身份。”

Asuka nodded in acknowledgement. "Thank you… But call me Asuka instead, sir."  
明日香点头表示感谢。“谢谢你……不过请叫我明日香，先生。”

Fuyutsuki smiled. "Thank you for reminding me, Asuka, I'll take your word… and now, Shinji."  
冬月微笑了。“谢谢你的提醒，明日香，我会记住你的话……现在，真嗣。”

Shinji blinked. "Pardon me?"

"I wish your mother were here to see you, as I think you've finally matured for even a short time, so I'm thankful that you learned much, understood and overcame your own weaknesses. Don't ever change that."  
“我希望你的母亲能看到你，我想你终于在短时间内成熟了，我很感激你学到了很多，理解并克服了自己的弱点。永远不要改变这一点。”

This time Shinji blushed. "Thank you, sir," he said, nodding.  
这次真嗣脸红了。“谢谢您，先生，”他点头说道。

"Now," Fuyutsuki said, "Kaworu Nagisa, for even you're a newcomer, we have a reason to be thankful for you."  
"现在，" 冬月说，"渚薰，尽管你是个新人，我们仍有理由感谢你。"

Kaworu nodded, blinking. "Why, sir?"  
渚点点头，眨了眨眼。"为什么，先生？"

"The best thing about your presence is that you're a catalyst for change. You maybe considered the best, but what is more admirable about you is your generosity and your propensity to help people, especially your teammates within Project E… and had it not for your intervention, it would be very difficult even for us to turn them around."  
"你存在的最大价值在于你是变革的催化剂。你或许被视为最优秀，但更令人钦佩的是你的慷慨和乐于助人的天性，尤其是对 E 计划中的队友们……若非你的介入，我们甚至很难让他们转变。"

"I appreciate that, sir. Much thanks," Kaworu answered as he smiled.  
"我很感激，先生。非常感谢，" 渚薰微笑着回答。

"Keep the good work, son," Fuyutsuki said. "Finally, in the same way a white rose blossoms in full from a simple bud, you have changed much, Rei Ayanami."  
"继续努力，孩子，" 冬月说。"终于，就像一朵白玫瑰从简单的花蕾中完全绽放，你改变了许多，绫波零。"

The First Children blinked. "Sir?"  
第一适格者眨了眨眼。"先生？"

Fuyutsuki nodded. "That's right. You never fail to astound the people around you, as you have transformed yourself into a better person. I admit that, back then you were almost mechanical, almost devoid of emotion and having this unfeeling, as if you were impervious to pain. Yet even you have your own personality, you have a heart and a mind of your own. Then Nagisa came and changed all that, and you were not the same again but instead… I'd say you've come to age, and so I commend your emerging maturity."  
冬月点了点头。“没错。你总是能让周围的人感到惊讶，因为你已经变成了一个更好的人。我承认，那时候的你几乎像个机器，几乎缺乏情感，冷漠无情，仿佛对痛苦无动于衷。然而，你也有自己的个性，有自己的心和思想。后来，渚出现了，改变了这一切，你不再是原来的你，而是……我可以说你已经成熟了，所以我赞赏你逐渐显现的成熟。”

Rei bowed her head. "Thank you, Sub-Commander," she said, now blushing completely.  
丽低下头。“谢谢您，副司令，”她说道，此刻满脸通红。

The elderly ex-professor gazed at his subordinates, who hung on every word he uttered, and with his glass of beer aloft he toasted, "To the Children… and to Kaji, Akagi, and Ikari."  
这位年迈的前教授看着他的下属们，他们全神贯注地听着他说的每一个字，他举起啤酒杯，祝酒道：“为了孩子们……以及加持、赤城和碇。”

"Hear, hear!" the assembled adults cheered louder, before they all tossed down their drinks, and at the same time with the rest of the pub hearing all this and watching them, the patrons yelled and whistled in approval, and that really brought the house down.  
“说得好！”聚集的大人们欢呼声更响亮了，随后他们齐齐举杯一饮而尽，与此同时，整个酒吧的其他人也听到了这一切，看着他们，顾客们纷纷喝彩吹哨，场面一度热闹非凡。

In the surveillance van, Morrissey yanked the headphones away from his head, as the recorded roar coming from the planted bugs nearly blew out his eardrums. Wincing and his ears smarting as he adjusted the volume, he said aloud, "What the hell's going on with those people?"  
在监控车内，莫里西猛地扯下耳机，植入的窃听器传来的巨大喧哗声几乎震破了他的耳膜。他皱着眉头，耳朵刺痛地调整音量，大声问道：“那些人到底在搞什么鬼？”

His assistant, seated just a yard away, merely shrugged.  
坐在仅一码远的助手只是耸了耸肩。

---

Now the party in the O-Club was in full swing, the cheerful atmosphere rejuvenating and moving even the most laggard of spirits. DJ Les (his real name was Lieutenant Leslie Booker Smith of the Eva Maintenance Division, and formerly an aircraft mechanic of the US Navy) was now busy, taking requests from eager patrons as he played one song after another; the Children and the Sub-Commander's presence graced the scene; all was magnificent inside the dive.  
现在，O-Club 的派对正热闹非凡，欢快的气氛让最懒散的灵魂也焕发了活力。DJ Les（他的真名是伊娃维护部门的莱斯利·布克·史密斯中尉，曾是美国海军的飞机机械师）正忙得不亦乐乎，接受着热情顾客的点歌请求，一首接一首地播放着音乐；孩子们和副司令的到场让场面更加精彩；这个潜水酒吧内一切都是那么美妙。

As they cooked and ate the strips of beef on the hibachi (except for Rei and Kaworu, of course, being self-declared vegetarians and so they opted for salad bowls), Trudy and Paul thought it a great opportunity to present to their friends about their own version of yesterday's events, their hands imitating the flight of their gunships as they narrated their war story. Misato, Shinji and Asuka corroborated with the pilots, adding their own experience of fighting off their attackers as the Cheyennes went for the kill to rescue them.  
他们在炭火烤架上烹饪并享用着牛肉条（当然，除了丽和薰，他们自称为素食者，所以选择了沙拉碗），特鲁迪和保罗认为这是个向朋友们讲述他们昨天经历的好机会，他们用手势模仿着直升机飞行的样子，讲述着他们的战斗故事。美里、真嗣和明日香与飞行员们相互印证，补充了他们自己对抗攻击者的经历，而夏延人则为了救援他们而展开了致命一击。

With their turn, Misato and Tsutomo explained on how the home invader Oda tried to kill Asuka but instead got the dose of his own medicine, and Misato humorously added that no one should underestimate her capacity to fight, even when intoxicated.  
轮到他们时，美里和筒本解释了入室抢劫犯织田试图杀害明日香，却反遭报应的情况，美里还幽默地补充说，没人应该低估她醉酒时的战斗力。

Not wanting to be outdone, Asuka and Shinji recounted their laughable "married couple" experiences, beginning with their first encounter on the aircraft carrier, followed by the next several missions against the Angels, and between those missions they talked about embarrassing moments at school.  
不甘示弱，明日香和真嗣讲述了他们作为“夫妻”的滑稽经历，从在航空母舰上的初次相遇开始，接着是接下来几次对抗使徒的任务，期间还穿插了在学校发生的尴尬时刻。

Excusing themselves, Tsutomo and Natsumi left the table, went to the dance floor and danced together to a slow song, before the Children likewise stood up and followed them, and the bridge crew trio were off to try their luck with the UFO Catcher; meanwhile Trudy and Paul decided to play pool, and Fuyutsuki wished them luck as they ambled to the table with their bottles of Kirin.  
筒本和夏美借口离开餐桌，走到舞池中随着一首慢歌翩翩起舞，孩子们随后也起身跟随他们，而桥员三人组则去尝试抓娃娃机；与此同时，特鲁迪和保罗决定打台球，冬月则祝他们好运，看着他们拿着麒麟啤酒走向球桌。

Now that they were the only ones left, Misato noted that Ritsuko was quiet for most of the time, apparently brooding as she drank and smoked. "What's on your mind?" she asked.  
现在只剩下她们两人，美里注意到律子大部分时间都很安静，显然是在一边喝酒抽烟一边沉思。“你在想什么呢？”她问道。

"Oh, I'm sorry," Ritsuko said, flustered. "N… Nothing, I'm enjoying the atmosphere."  
“哦，对不起，”律子有些慌乱地说，“没……没什么，我只是享受这里的氛围。”

Misato nodded. "Ah." 美里点点头。“啊。”

Ritsuko tapped the cigarette on the ashtray. "But I remember something… Have you remembered about us talking about hedgehogs?" she asked before taking hold of her glass and drank.  
律子在烟灰缸上轻敲着香烟。“但我记得一些事……你还记得我们谈论刺猬的事吗？”她拿起杯子喝了一口，问道。

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Hedgehogs?"

"Yes, of course," Misato answered. "Why?"  
“当然记得，”美里回答，“怎么了？”

Ritsuko tabled her glass, pulled a drag off her stick of Mild Seven and blew a stream of smoke, before she went on. "It used to be that we were so concerned about Shinji's behavior, that like a hedgehog trying to give warmth to others, yet in the process hurting with quills, he's afraid then, of hurting others." She then produced a small smile and added, "But now, he's a changed man, and that's what I'm happy about. "  
律子放下杯子，抽了一口柔和七星烟，吐出一缕烟雾，然后继续说道：“过去我们非常担心真嗣的行为，就像一只试图用刺给他人温暖的刺猬，却在过程中被自己的刺所伤，他那时害怕伤害到别人。”她随即露出一丝微笑，补充道：“但现在，他变了，这正是我感到高兴的地方。”

"So what do you think about his future?" Misato asked.  
"那你觉得他的未来会怎样？" 美里问道。

"Personally," Ritsuko answered, "I think he'll be a better man than his father, not wanting to repeat the same mistakes… and I also think that he'll be getting himself a box of disposable razors."  
"就我个人而言，" 律子回答，"我认为他会比他父亲更优秀，不想重蹈覆辙……而且我觉得他会给自己买一盒一次性剃须刀。"

Misato blinked. "For what? Don't ask me he could—"  
美里眨了眨眼。"为什么？别告诉我他可能会——"

The scientist shook her head. "Nope, he will shave off any trace of stubble on his chin at the first sign because I feel he doesn't want to be that chip off the old block."  
科学家摇了摇头。“不，他一有迹象就会剃掉下巴上的任何胡茬，因为我觉得他不想成为那个老套的模仿者。”

"Well," Fuyutsuki interjected, as he popped wasabi-coated peanuts into his mouth, "he's really his mother's son, that's why he has an affinity for Rei, because, as you two have said before, she carries the positive characteristics that were also present in his mother."  
“嗯，”冬月插话道，同时将裹着山葵的花生扔进嘴里，“他确实是母亲的翻版，这就是为什么他对绫波有亲近感，因为你们俩之前说过，她身上有着他母亲也具备的积极特质。”

"And which, of course, makes her his sister," Ritsuko added.  
“当然，这也让她成了他的妹妹，”律子补充道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "That's right… Wait a minute."  
冬月点了点头。“没错……等一下。”

Both women blinked. "What is it, sir?" they asked in unison.  
两位女士都眨了眨眼。“怎么了，先生？”她们异口同声地问道。

"If you're wondering where the Commander is, right now he's spending his time alone at his office," the elderly man disclosed.  
“如果你想知道司令在哪里，现在他正独自在他的办公室里度过时间，”这位老人透露道。

"Even now?" Ritsuko snorted and shook her head. "What the hell he is, Ebenezer Scrooge?" she whispered aloud to Misato, sourly making a comparative reference to the brooding, money-obsessed Charles Dickens character.  
"即便现在？" 律子嗤之以鼻，摇了摇头。"他到底是什么人，埃比尼泽·斯克鲁奇吗？" 她低声对美里说，酸溜溜地提到了那个忧郁、对金钱痴迷的查尔斯·狄更斯笔下的人物。

"I think he still has his ghosts to exorcise," Misato quipped before they burst into laughter, yet just as she was about to pick up her drink, someone tapped onto her shoulder. She turned around to find Makoto standing right before her, the younger officer adjusting his glasses before he smiled.  
"我觉得他还有些鬼魂要驱除，" 美里打趣道，随后她们爆发出笑声，然而就在她准备拿起饮料时，有人轻拍了她的肩膀。她转过身，发现真站在她面前，这位年轻的军官调整了一下眼镜，然后微笑着。

Misato blinked twice, quite surprised. "What?"  
美里眨了两次眼，相当惊讶。"什么？"

Makoto sighed and offered his hand. "Can I have this dance with you?" he requested.  
真琴叹了口气，伸出手来。“我能与你共舞一曲吗？”他请求道。

Seeing that the Children once again took the floor, DJ Les smiled and he put on _Flightless Bird, American Mouth,_ before the lights were dimmed and a hush swept over the patrons.  
看到孩子们再次步入舞池，DJ Les 微笑着播放了《Flightless Bird, American Mouth》，随后灯光调暗，顾客们陷入一片寂静。

"Oh, I know that," Asuka said, recognizing the song, as her arms were around Shinji. "It's from the movie." She then smiled.  
“哦，我知道这首歌，”明日香说着，认出了旋律，她的手臂环绕着真嗣。“这是电影里的。”她随即微笑起来。

Shinji blinked. "What movie?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“什么电影？”

"_Twilight,_ you goof."

The boy chuckled sheepishly. "Oh, hehe…"

But Asuka thought about changing the subject, perhaps about the Evas. "I haven't seen you pilot Unit One," she said.  
但明日香想换个话题，也许是关于 EVA 的。“我还没见过你驾驶初号机呢，”她说。

"Except for my practice with Kaworu in the gunnery room, and that was a few days ago," Shinji answered, remembering the afternoon where he and the Fifth Children were tested, "I haven't done so in combat, ever since Ayanami blew up Unit Zero."  
“除了在炮击训练室和卡罗尔练习的那次，那还是几天前的事，”真嗣回答，回忆起他和第五适格者被测试的那个下午，“自从绫波炸毁了零号机后，我就再也没有在实战中驾驶过了。”

"Can't wait," Asuka said, nudging closer to the young man.  
“等不及了，”明日香说着，向年轻人身边靠得更近了。

Shinji blinked. "What for? Another battle with an Angel?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“为什么？又是一场与使徒的战斗吗？”

"No… I really wanted quality time with you," she admitted. "Only us alone, so why not later, after all this?"  
“不……我真的很想和你共度一些优质时光，”她坦白道，“只有我们俩，单独在一起，那为什么不在这一切结束后呢？”

"Where do you think we should be going?" Shinji asked worriedly. "Misato might get angry if we run off to someplace."  
"你觉得我们应该去哪儿？" 真嗣担忧地问道，"如果我们擅自跑去某个地方，美里可能会生气的。"

Asuka frowned. "Why not ask for permission? After all, we should be having our turn, just like what Misato and Kaji did before."  
明日香皱了皱眉。"为什么不先征求同意呢？毕竟，我们也应该有自己的时间，就像美里和加持之前那样。"

"Oh, I see… Anyway, where do you want us to go?"  
"哦，我明白了……那么，你想我们去哪儿？"

"To the pool."

Shinji had a double-take. "Why? I can't swim, and we could get ourselves in trouble," he doubted.  
真嗣愣了一下。“为什么？我不会游泳，而且我们可能会遇到麻烦，”他怀疑地说。

"Trouble? It's always open, yet it's also off-hours and no one else's gonna hang around there, and besides, you need help."  
“麻烦？那里总是开放的，但现在是非营业时间，不会有人在那儿闲逛，而且，你需要帮助。”

"You mean you want to teach me how to swim?"  
“你是说你想教我游泳？”

"Yeah."

"Even wearing these clothes?"

Asuka grinned at the young man in a naughty way. "No, we'll skinny-dip."  
明日香调皮地对年轻人笑了笑。"不，我们要裸泳。"

"I don't understand, but what's that?" Shinji wondered, having never heard of the word, as Asuka transliterated the word from English into Japanese.  
"我不明白，那是什么？" 真嗣疑惑地问，从未听过这个词，因为明日香是从英语直译成日语的。

The redhead giggled at his inability to comprehend. "You'll find out later, dummy," she riposted, but was then surprised when the girl saw Misato dancing with, of all men, the geeky-looking Makoto Hyuga, her _aide-de-camp_.  
红发女孩因他无法理解而咯咯笑了起来。"你以后会知道的，傻瓜，"她回敬道，但随即惊讶地看到美里正和，居然是那个书呆子样的日向诚，她的副官跳舞。

---

"So… Why me?" Misato asked, as Makoto led her in their steps, waltzing gently.  
"那么…为什么是我？" 美里问道，随着诚的引导，两人轻柔地跳着华尔兹。

"You're alone, that's why," the lieutenant said, his hands embraced behind the woman's back.  
"因为你独自一人，这就是原因，" 中尉说道，双手环抱在女子的背后。

"Ah, come on, tell me the truth," the colonel badgered softly. "Otherwise people would start telling strange stories about us. HQ's a small world, and you know that."  
"啊，别这样，告诉我实话，" 上校轻声纠缠道。"否则人们会开始编造关于我们的奇怪故事。总部是个小世界，你懂的。"

Makoto nodded. "Okay… It's like this: I've been working with you for the longest time."  
真琴点了点头。“好吧……是这样的：我和你一起工作已经很久了。”

Misato blinked. "And so?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“然后呢？”

"I wanted to tell you, because I don't have the courage back then to tell everyone else for it's my terrible secret."  
“我想告诉你，因为那时候我没有勇气告诉其他人，因为那是我糟糕的秘密。”

"You mean you do have a _crush_ on me?"  
"你是说你真的喜欢我？"

"I'm sorry, but y… Yes," Makoto finally admitted, swallowing hard but he was trying to maintain their dancing tempo without missing a beat.  
"对不起，但...是的，" 真琴终于承认了，艰难地咽了咽口水，但他努力保持跳舞的节奏，没有错过任何一个节拍。

"Thanks for telling me the truth," Misato said, trying not to cry.  
"谢谢你告诉我真相，" 美里说，努力不让眼泪流出来。

"Uh my pleasure, but… What's wrong?" he asked worriedly.  
"啊，不客气，但是……怎么了？" 他担心地问道。

"I remember someone," she whispered while blinking, reminded all too well of Kaji.  
"我想起了某个人，" 她眨着眼低声说，不由自主地想起了加治。

Makoto merely shrugged. "No, don't worry; I understand whom you're thinking of, and I hope he's okay with me doing this gesture for you… Fact is, it's a great honor for me."  
真琴只是耸了耸肩。"不，别担心；我知道你在想谁，我希望他不会介意我为你做这个动作……事实上，这对我是莫大的荣幸。"

"I'm all right with it." Misato then laid her head on the younger man's shoulder. "Just one night, and I need someone that I can confide with."  
"我对此没意见。" 美里随后将头靠在年轻男子的肩上。"就这一晚，我需要一个可以倾诉的人。"

The lieutenant nodded. "Will do… _Semper fi,_" he whispered, reminding her that his faithfulness and sense of duty matched that of the American Marines' famous motto.  
中尉点头道："我会做到的……永远忠诚，"他低声说，提醒她他的忠诚和责任感与美国海军陆战队的著名格言相匹配。

As Natsumi and Tsutomo were in an embrace, swaying slowly to the music, the agent said, "I'm sorry about what happened, but we couldn't avoid it." He was referring to yesterday's entanglement with the IR, which forced them to cancel their date at Odawara.  
当夏美和津友在音乐中缓缓摇摆时，特工说道："对于发生的事情，我很抱歉，但我们无法避免。"他指的是昨天与 IR 的纠缠，这迫使他们取消了在小田原的约会。

"I understand that," Natsumi said. "Shit happens all the time."  
"我明白的，"夏美说。"倒霉事总是不断发生。"

Tsutomo chuckled. "Yeah, right…. But you know what? It's strange for me that we accidentally wound up in the thick of things, right in the middle of whatever is happening."  
筒本轻笑了一声。"是啊，没错……不过你知道吗？对我们来说，意外卷入这一切的中心，正好处于事件的漩涡之中，这对我来说挺奇怪的。"

Natsumi sighed. "I noticed that, too, Tomo, but I want to say something."  
夏美叹了口气。"我也注意到了，Tomo，但我有些话想说。"

"About what?" “关于什么？”

"To tell you the truth, when I was fourteen, back then I wasn't able to date anyone, nor anyone asking me to go out," she sadly admitted. "I couldn't even get chocolates on White Day."  
“说实话，当我十四岁的时候，那时我既不能和任何人约会，也没有人邀请我出去，”她悲伤地承认，“我甚至在白色情人节连巧克力都收不到。”

Tsutomo blinked. "Why? You look great now."  
“为什么？你现在看起来很棒啊。”

'If you saw my high school pictures, well, I look very embarrassing: I had braces, I was too thin, I didn't have a nice, delicious chest… and I was a nerd, but not an _otaku_! It's no wonder that I was a target for bullies." Natsumi then made a sour face.  
“如果你看到我高中时的照片，呃，我看起来非常尴尬：我戴着牙套，太瘦了，没有漂亮、诱人的胸部……而且我还是个书呆子，但不是御宅族！难怪我成了被欺负的对象。”夏美接着做出一副酸溜溜的表情。

"There's nothing wrong being a nerd," Tsutomo said.  
“当个书呆子没什么不好，”筒友说。

"But there's a difference between an ordinary nerd, and a creative nerd who have ideas that can make money," Natsumi countered. "I'm in the former, doing boring things, and those in the latter… the man who set up Facebook or the guy who either made Windows or the Mac or Napster, they're the ones with the interesting jobs."  
“但普通书呆子和有创意的书呆子是有区别的，后者能想出赚钱的点子，”夏美反驳道，“我是前者，做着无聊的事情，而后者……比如创立 Facebook 的人，或者发明 Windows、Mac 或 Napster 的家伙，他们才是拥有有趣工作的人。”

"I don't care about that, Natsumi. You've come a long way from that old self of yours, so don't beat yourself."  
"我不在乎那个，夏美。你已经和过去的自己大不相同了，所以别再自责了。"

Natsumi nodded. "Well, okay… But thanks for having an open ear, 'cause I wanted to get this inferiority complex off my chest."  
夏美点点头。“好吧，好吧……不过谢谢你能倾听，因为我真的很想把这种自卑感说出来。”

"My pleasure," the agent said, as the audience watching them from the dim background, began to flip open and light up their Zippos and any lighters they held, slowly creating a startlingly beautiful and magical backdrop, a constellation of tiny yellow flames.  
“乐意之至，”特工说道，与此同时，从昏暗的背景中观看他们的人群开始打开并点燃他们的 Zippo 打火机和任何他们持有的打火机，慢慢地创造出一个惊人美丽而神奇的背景，一片由微小黄色火焰组成的星座。

"Oh, by the way," Natsumi said. "Where do you want us to go after this?"  
"哦，顺便问一下，" 夏美说。"这次之后你想让我们去哪儿？"

Tsutomo had a double-take. "You tell me where."  
津友生愣了一下。"你告诉我去哪儿。"

"Instead, why don't we have a nightcap of some hot coffee at my pad?" she finally suggested before beaming in a naughty way.  
"不如我们去我那儿喝杯热咖啡，怎么样？"她最后提议道，脸上露出一丝调皮的笑容。"

At that same moment, DJ Les now carefully switched over to _Magic Works_, a slow song from one of the _Harry Potter_ movies: _"This one's going out to all the lovers out there. Hold each other tight, and keep each other warm…"_  
就在同一时刻，DJ Les 小心翼翼地切换到了《哈利·波特》电影中的一首慢歌《魔法工坊》：“这首曲子献给所有在场的爱人们。紧紧相拥，温暖彼此……”

Now the whole world had their eyes on Rei and Kaworu, dancing slowly in the spotlight, savoring this moment while being surrounded by a candlelight constellation made out of Zippo flames.  
此刻，全世界的目光都聚焦在丽和卡沃鲁身上，他们在聚光灯下缓缓起舞，享受着这一刻，四周是由 Zippo 火焰组成的烛光星座环绕。

_And dance your final dance  
跳完这最后的舞  
This is your final chance  
这是你最后的机会  
To hold the one you love  
去拥抱你所爱的人  
You know you've waited long enough…  
你知道你已经等得够久了……_

_So… Believe that magic works  
所以…相信魔法的力量  
Don't be afraid  
Of bein' hurt  
Don't let this magic die  
别让这魔法消逝  
The answer's there 答案就在那里  
Oh, just look in her eyes…  
哦，只需看她的眼睛……_

His heart moved greatly, Kaworu then stared into Rei's soft eyes and figured that somehow fate had played a strange yet beautiful trick on them; they weren't supposed to be together like this, for they belonged to rival lilim, akin to Romeo and Juliet, fated to be pawns in their struggle to achieve Instrumentality.  
他的心为之动容，碇真嗣凝视着绫波丽温柔的双眸，意识到命运似乎在他们身上开了一个既奇异又美丽的玩笑；他们本不该如此相依，因为他们分属对立的莉莉姆，犹如罗密欧与朱丽叶，注定要在实现人类补完计划的斗争中成为棋子。

Yet this was their quiet rebellion, a daring defiance of their masters' directives.  
然而，这是他们无声的反叛，对主人指令的大胆违抗。

_And make  
Your final move  
Mmm, don't be scared 嗯，别害怕  
She wants you to 她希望你  
It's hard  
You must be brave 你必须勇敢  
Don't let this moment slip the way…  
别让这一刻溜走……_

Rei snuggled closer to Kaworu's shoulder, as if she didn't want to let go. Kaworu then smiled and he wondered where Shinji and Asuka were dancing. Ah, he found them just a meter away, in their own intimate world, but without a word Shinji stared back at his direction and then held up an a-OK sign, telling them that everything was perfect as Asuka lazily rest her head upon the boy's shoulder.  
丽更紧地依偎在渚薰的肩上，仿佛不愿放手。渚薰微笑着，心中好奇真嗣和明日香在哪儿跳舞。啊，他发现他们就在一米开外，沉浸在自己的小世界里，真嗣默默地望向他，然后竖起大拇指，示意一切都很完美，明日香慵懒地将头靠在真嗣的肩上。

_Congratulations,_ Kaworu saluted them in his thoughts, softly smiling, and then he guessed as to what Misato and the others were doing. Perhaps they were also watching them, awestruck and maybe heart-struck, remembering love unrequited, and he grinned when he saw Misato dancing with Makoto among the other couples. _Love is blind,_ he told himself.  
恭喜了，渚薰在心中向他们致敬，微笑着，然后猜测美里和其他人在做什么。或许他们也在注视着，被感动，或许心中涌起未曾回应的爱意，当他看到美里与真琴在其他情侣中起舞时，他笑了。爱情是盲目的，他对自己说。

_Believe that magic works 相信魔法的力量  
Don't be afraid  
Afraid of bein' hurt  
No, don't let this magic die  
不，别让这魔法消逝  
Ooh, the answer's there 哦，答案就在那里  
Yeah, just look in her eyes…  
是啊，只要看她的眼睛……_

"I do not want to lose you," Rei whispered into his ear.  
“我不想失去你，”丽在他耳边低语。

"I will not," Kaworu solemnly replied. "We'll always try to keep ourselves together, I promise."  
“我不会的，”渚郑重地回答，“我们会一直努力保持在一起，我保证。”

The First Children sighed. "Thank you."  
初代孩子们叹了口气。“谢谢你。”

_And don't believe that magic can die  
别相信魔法会消逝  
No, no, no, this magic can't die…  
不，不，不，这魔法不会消逝……_

Both Children paused, and then Kaworu said, "Merry Christmas, Rei."  
两个孩子都停顿了一下，然后渚薰说道：“圣诞快乐，绫波。”

Rei nodded. "Merry Christmas to you, too, Nagisa," she answered, her cerise eyes blinking softly.  
绫波点点头。“圣诞快乐，渚，”她回答道，她那淡红色的眼睛温柔地眨了眨。

They took a breath to gain courage, before Kaworu leaned down to kiss Rei slowly on the lips. As they did, both savoring this intimate moment among the other lilim, the Fifth Children thought of the NERV motto taken from a famous Browning poem: _"God is in his heaven; all's right with the world."_  
他们深吸一口气以鼓起勇气，随后渚薰俯身慢慢吻上了绫波的唇。当他们这样做时，两人都在其他莉莉姆中享受着这份亲密时刻，第五适格者想起了从著名布朗宁诗中引用的 NERV 座右铭：“上帝在他的天堂；世上一切安好。”

Indeed, even for this one night, with the forewarning and the danger of the future held at bay, everything was all right.  
确实，即便只是这一夜，在预知未来危险并将其暂时搁置的情况下，一切都还好。

_So dance, your final dance…  
所以，跳吧，你最后的舞蹈……  
'Cause this is, your final chance…  
因为这是，你最后的机会……_

**AUTHOR'S NOTES:** I delivered… and I SCORED! (Laughter) Okay, I did this one in a space of less than three days, fueled by my own caffeine-and-oatmeal-powered imagination (don't worry, I really eat a very balanced diet), with the entire plot, dialogue, scenery and situation locked in, then stitched and assembled in my mind, before my fingers do all the walking.  
作者的话：我完成了……而且我得分了！（笑声）好吧，我是在不到三天的时间里完成的，灵感来源于我那咖啡因和燕麦片驱动的想象力（别担心，我真的吃得非常均衡），整个情节、对话、场景和情境都已在我脑海中构思完毕，然后由我的手指一步步敲打出来。

To be honest, this chapter was conceived several months ago while in planning for this season, and even as everything else tried to overwhelm me, I fought to keep the storyline intact, up to the dénouement, refreshed from time to time by new ideas.  
老实说，这个chapter是在几个月前为这个季度策划时构思的，尽管其他事情试图压倒我，我仍努力保持故事线的完整，直到结局，不时被新想法刷新。

All right, then, I don't know if this was the best chapter I came up with, but I really wanted to capture the moment, that one magnificent part of the story, render a world in words and emotions, with characters pulsing with life, heart and mind.  
好吧，我不知道这是不是我想出的最好的chapter，但我真的很想捕捉那一刻，故事中那精彩绝伦的部分，用文字和情感描绘一个世界，让角色充满生命力、心灵和思想。

And this is one of those moments. To my readers worldwide, I always thank you for inspiring me to move forward with another written page, and keeping my imagination ablaze.  
而此刻正是那些时刻之一。向全球的读者们，我始终感谢你们激励我继续前行，书写新的一页，并让我的想象力熊熊燃烧。

Next Chapter: Trysts (working title, guys, so SERVICE! SERVICE!)  
下一章 Chapter：幽会（暂定标题，各位，所以服务！服务！）

### Chapter 35 Trysts

_**Caution:**_ _Befitting the rating of this fic, there's one serving of 80-proof vodka with a twist of serious lime ahead. Don't say I didn't warn you._  
警告：鉴于本文的分级，前方将有一杯加了一抹严肃青柠的 80 度伏特加伺候。别说我没提醒你。

Once the bartender announced that it was time to close down the O-Club, and at the same time the music died down, everyone began to get off their seats, pick up their belongings and hunker towards the door. Already, Fuyutsuki went ahead thirty minutes ago, followed by Tsutomo and Natsumi, and Ritsuko, Maya and Shigeru had left an hour earlier, saying that they needed to get up early for work.  
当调酒师宣布关闭 O 俱乐部的时刻到来，音乐也随之减弱，众人开始离座，拿起各自的物品，纷纷向门口涌去。不久前，冬月已经先行离开，随后是堤摩和夏美，而丽子和真耶以及茂已经在一小时前离去，他们说需要早起上班。

As they walked out of the tavern, Misato, being supported by Makoto by having her arm draped over his back and shoulders, hiccupped and said, "Where we're going?"  
他们走出酒馆时，美里被诚搀扶着，她的手臂搭在他的背和肩膀上，她打了个嗝，问道：“我们要去哪儿？”

"You need some rest," Makoto replied, the woman's laptop bag hanging on his shoulder and neck.  
“你需要休息一下，”诚回答道，女子的笔记本电脑包挂在他的肩颈上。

Shinji, walking alongside her, asked, "Can we… Uh, go elsewhere?"  
与她并肩走着的真嗣问道：“我们……呃，能去别的地方吗？”

Misato blinked. "What? Where you going with?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“什么？你要去哪儿？”

"I'm with him," Asuka said. "We just need a bit more time between each other."  
“我跟他一起，”明日香说，“我们只是需要彼此间多一点时间。”

The woman nodded. "Ah… Sure, no problem."  
女人点点头。“啊…当然，没问题。”

Both Children smiled. "Thanks," Shinji said.  
两个孩子都笑了。“谢谢，”真嗣说。

"But be careful, okay? Permission granted, you two," Misato added before Shinji faced Kaworu.  
“但要小心，好吗？许可已经给了，你们俩，”美里补充道，随后真嗣面对着渚薰。

"What about the both of you?" Shinji asked.  
“那你们俩呢？”真嗣问道。

"Oh," Kaworu said, his hand holding Rei's. "I have to pick something up, bring her home, then come back here."  
“哦，”薰说，他的手握着绫波的。“我得去取点东西，送她回家，然后再回来这里。”

Wordlessly Rei nodded in response.  
绫波无声地点头回应。

"One word before you lovebirds leave," Misato harrumphed.  
"在你们这对小情侣离开前，我还有一句话，" 美里哼了一声。

The Children blinked, halting in mid-step. "What?" they all asked.  
孩子们眨了眨眼，脚步一顿。"什么？" 他们齐声问道。

"Take care of yourselves, and then I think tomorrow, Shinji-"  
"照顾好自己，然后我想明天，真嗣——"

"Yeah?" the young man said as they came inside the Headquarters building, a small lobby built into the side, and just ahead was a bank of elevators.  
“嗯？”年轻人说着，随着他们进入总部大楼，一个小型大厅建在侧面，正前方是一排电梯。

"I'll have a compatibility test arranged for you to get back to Unit One," Misato said. "I'm hoping that by now she's all right and should be able to recognize you."  
“我会为你安排一次兼容性测试，让你回到初号机，”美里说，“我希望她现在一切正常，应该能认出你。”

Shinji nodded. "Okay."

"As for you, Asuka," Misato added. "You'll have to do some combat simulator tests in Unit Two to be refreshed, get up to date and bring you back in line."  
“至于你，明日香，”美里补充道，“你需要在二号机上进行一些战斗模拟测试，以更新你的状态，让你重回正轨。”

"Will do," Asuka agreed. Instinctively she twitched her pointer finger, as if itching to pull the trigger once more.  
“会做的，”明日香同意道。她本能地动了动食指，仿佛再次渴望扣动扳机。

The woman, still inebriated, shook her head and took in a deep breath in an attempt to relieve herself some of the nausea. "I'm hoping that, by the time I wake up," Misato said. "Section Two might have a breakthrough."  
那女人仍醉意朦胧，摇了摇头，深吸一口气试图缓解些许恶心感。“我希望醒来时，”美里说，“第二课能有突破。”

Makoto nodded. "But still, he's out there somewhere."  
真点了点头。“但无论如何，他还在某个地方。”

"Yeah," Misato agreed, and she turned her attention to Shinji and Kaworu. "You Children, I grant your leave. Go and be careful, and then come back in one piece for work, okay?"  
"嗯，" 美里同意道，然后将注意力转向真嗣和薰。"你们这些孩子，我准你们假。去吧，小心点，然后完好无损地回来工作，好吗？"

"Yes," Rei said, holding onto Kaworu's hand even firmer.  
"好的，" 丽说，紧紧握住薰的手。

"No problem," Asuka added, before she yanked Shinji's hand and they ran off ahead of them. "See you later!"  
"没问题，" 明日香补充道，然后猛地拉起真嗣的手，他们跑到了前面。"再见！"

Once the Children split up in pairs, with Rei and Kaworu taking an elevator up to the BOQ, while Shinji and Asuka took another elevator down to the recreation area, Misato said to Makoto, "More or less, I think I did my best as their guardian."  
孩子们分成两组后，丽和薰乘电梯前往 BOQ，而真嗣和明日香则乘另一部电梯下到娱乐区，美里对真希说：“我想，作为他们的监护人，我已经尽力了。”

"Yeah, but watch your step," Makoto reminded her.  
“是啊，但小心脚下，”真希提醒她。

"Say," Misato whispered to Makoto, the woman holding her head as she leaned on a nearby wall. "Why don't we have some coffee at Lawson's in the lobby before we hit the sack?"  
“对了，”美里低声对真希说，她靠在附近的墙上，用手扶着头。“我们何不在大厅的罗森便利店喝杯咖啡再睡觉呢？”

Taken aback, Makoto blinked this time, glasses almost coming off his face but managed to push them back with his fingers. "Are you serious?" he asked, thinking she wanted him on bed.  
吃了一惊的 Makoto 这次眨了眨眼，眼镜差点从脸上滑落，但他用手指推了回去。“你是认真的吗？”他问道，以为她想让他上床。

Misato shook her head. "No… No, we need to talk, that's all. I need an outlet… and a couple of headache tablets."  
Misato 摇了摇头。“不……不，我们得谈谈，仅此而已。我需要一个发泄口……还有几片头痛药。”

Several hundred meters away, Natsumi's home was located on the Geofront's hillside, built as one of the executive cottages that several years ago, previously housed the chief engineer who oversaw the construction of the NERV complex.  
数百米之外，夏美的家坐落在地表之下的山坡上，是多年前为监督 NERV 总部建设的首席工程师所建的几栋高管别墅之一。

Inside, Natsumi had the interior decorated in beige and brown tones, and she set in place pieces of Ikea furniture around the living room. Reproductions of two ancient calligraphy scrolls were hung on each side of the fireplace, whose fire from the burning natural gas coming out of the simulated ceramic piles of logs crackled and hissed.  
室内，夏美以米色和棕色调装饰，并在客厅中摆放了宜家家具。壁炉两侧挂着两幅古代书法卷轴的复制品，壁炉中燃烧的天然气从仿陶瓷的木柴堆中喷出，发出噼啪和嘶嘶声。

At this moment, instead of drinking coffee as planned, Natsumi and Tsutomo were kissing torridly, their hands gliding over their bodies, trying to strip whatever clothing they had on, before they went onto the bed. Tsutomo kept onto his ministrations, kissing the woman all over, enjoying the scent of her body.  
此刻，夏美和津友原本计划喝咖啡，却激烈地拥吻起来，双手在彼此身上游走，试图脱去身上仅有的衣物，随后便滚到了床上。津友继续他的爱抚，亲吻着女人的每一寸肌肤，享受着她身体的香气。

He then mounted himself right on top of the woman, and in sweat began to join in closer in the wetness; Natsumi's pleasured moans filled the bedroom until the moment of climax.  
他随即跨坐在女人身上，汗水交融中更紧密地结合在一起；夏美愉悦的呻吟声充斥着卧室，直至高潮来临。

Only then Tsutomo rolled away from her unclothed form and they sighed in unison.  
直到那时，津友才从她赤裸的身躯旁滚开，两人同时叹息。

They waited for several minutes, taking their time to rest; breathing heavily as if they've ran through the finish line on a marathon.  
他们等待了几分钟，慢慢休息；呼吸沉重，仿佛刚跑完马拉松冲过终点线。

"That was hard," Natsumi said, breaking the silence.  
“那真不容易，”夏美打破了沉默。

Tsutomo blinked. "What?"  
筒友眨了眨眼。“什么？”

Without a word, the woman pointed out that the sheet now had a small bloodstain, meaning to say that she finally lost her virginity.  
那女人一言不发，指着床单上的一小片血迹，意在表明她终于失去了童贞。

"You're the _first ever_," Natsumi admitted. "I've studied a bit of gynecology on the side, knew the precautions and the contraceptives since high school; watched some little… er… soft porn on the side, tried masturbating… But, damn… this… _this hurts!_"  
"你是第一个，"夏美承认道，"我自学了一些妇科知识，高中时就了解过注意事项和避孕措施；看过一些……呃……小黄片，尝试过自慰……但是，该死……这……这真的很疼！"

"It really does hurt," Tsutomo said as she stroked his chest.  
"确实很疼，"堤摩说，同时抚摸着他的胸膛。

"Then that makes you a pro. When's the first time you lost your cherry?"  
"那你就算是老手了。你第一次是什么时候？"

The agent blinked, and he blushed; Tsutomo had, at last count, flings with at least twelve women in his lifetime, and this woman was the thirteenth. "Me?"  
特工眨了眨眼，脸红了；据最后统计，筒本一生中至少有过十二段短暂恋情，而这个女人将是第十三个。“我吗？”

Natsumi laughed. "Yeah, but why hide it?"  
夏美笑了。“是啊，但为什么要隐瞒呢？”

"Because it's a bit embarrassing to talk about it—"  
"因为谈论这个有点不好意思——"

"With a woman, right?"  
"和女人一起，对吧？"

"Yeah."

"Of course in a bathhouse you'll talk with the rest of the boys about it."  
"当然，在澡堂里你会和其他男孩们聊这些的。"

Tsutomo nodded. "You're right."  
筒友点了点头。“你说得对。”

Natsumi sighed and said, "Okay, I'm all ears. Tell me, spill the beans... We're on our own."  
夏美叹了口气，说道：“好吧，我洗耳恭听。告诉我，全盘托出……我们只能靠自己了。”

"Okay… Back when I was eighteen… If I could remember right," Tsutomo recalled. "We did a quickie right inside the toilet stall on the fourth floor."  
“好吧……我十八岁那年……如果我没记错的话，”筒友回忆道，“我们在四楼厕所的隔间里匆匆忙忙地做了那事。”

Natsumi snorted. "Some memory you got."  
夏美哼了一声。“你这记性真不怎么样。”

"Yeah," he agreed. "But we lasted for only four months before calling it quits."  
“是啊，”他同意道。“但我们只坚持了四个月就分手了。”

"What's her name?" “她叫什么名字？”

"Yumiko. Tallest in my class. A hottie with all the works… Long hair, cute face, big chest…"  
"由美子。我们班最高的女生。一个火辣辣的美女，样样俱全……长发飘飘，脸蛋可爱，胸部丰满……"

"And dumb?"

"I'm afraid so. She flunked third year twice in a row."  
"恐怕是的。她连续两年留级三年级。"

"Why did you leave her?"  
"你为什么要离开她？"

Tsutomo made a face. "She was seeing someone else," he said, leaving out the fact that Yumiko was moonlighting as a streetwalker, while wearing a school uniform.  
筒友做出一副表情。“她在和别人交往，”他说，省略了由美子穿着校服在街头拉客的事实。

"That's no surprise." “那并不意外。”

"Yeah, and from there I changed my mind, by not trying to hitch with a girl straight out of _Sabra_," he said, referring to a popular girlie magazine. "Unless-"  
“是啊，从那以后我就改变了主意，不再试图搭讪刚从《萨布拉》出来的女孩，”他提到一本流行的女性杂志，“除非——”

Natsumi crawled over Tsutomo's chest, stared right up into his face and smiled. "Forget it. You've got me now, and I have everything you want."  
夏美爬过堤人的胸膛，直直地盯着他的脸，微笑道：“算了吧。你现在有我了，我拥有你想要的一切。”

Tsutomo nodded. "Thank you," he whispered.  
堤人点点头。“谢谢你，”他低声说道。

"My pleasure," she replied, before they kissed slowly.  
“乐意之至，”她回答，随后他们缓缓地吻在一起。

Far away, deep in the bowels of NERV HQ, where the swimming pool was located, Shinji and Asuka stood right before the pool filled with warm water. Tonight they had the whole place all for both of them, and at this early hour with no one guarding the premises.  
在 NERV 总部深处，游泳池所在的地方，真嗣和明日香正站在满是温水的泳池前。今晚，整个地方只属于他们两人，在这个无人值守的早些时候。

"Why don't we change—" Shinji said as he was about to suggest about changing to swimwear, but was cut off when Asuka quickly strip off her clothes and tossed them aside on the floor, leaving only her underwear on.  
“我们为什么不换——”真嗣正要说换上泳装，却被明日香迅速脱掉衣服扔到地板上，只留下内衣的动作打断了。

"This is _skinny-dipping_," Asuka replied, and she jumped into the water with a loud splash.  
"这就是裸泳，" 明日香回答道，随即扑通一声跳进了水里。

Shinji was speechless, wondering if his nose could leak with blood or not.  
真嗣无言以对，心里琢磨着他的鼻子会不会流血。

"Come on," Asuka cajoled as she bobbed on the water. "I have to teach you, but take off those clothes first!"  
"快来吧，" 明日香在水面上漂浮着催促道。"我得教你，不过先把衣服脱了！"

"Um… Okay," the young man agreed as he took off everything but his boxers. Once that was done, he made a step forward, and dipped his right foot into the water. It was just right; warm, not freezing.  
"嗯…好吧，"年轻人答应着，脱得只剩下了内裤。做完这些后，他向前迈了一步，将右脚浸入水中。水温恰到好处；温暖，并不冰冷。

"How deep is it?" Shinji asked.  
"有多深？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka laughed. "Just get in, dummy. It's just a meter deep for starters, so don't worry."  
明日香笑了。"直接进来吧，傻瓜。一开始只有一米深，所以不用担心。

The young man slowly crouched down, right foot first, and then propped himself to slid carefully into the water until he was chest-deep; it was warm, all right, but he wasn't sure about what Asuka might teach him.  
年轻人缓缓蹲下，右脚先入水，然后撑着自己小心翼翼地滑入水中，直到胸部深陷；水是温暖的，没错，但他不确定明日香会教他些什么。

"Say, when's the last time you tried to swim?" Asuka questioned, her red hair now wet after dunking herself in the drink.  
“我说，你上次尝试游泳是什么时候？”明日香问道，她的红发在浸入水中后已经湿透。

Shinji sighed as the water splashed around him. "Second grade, I guess… But I never got to follow it up."  
真嗣叹了口气，水花在他周围飞溅。“我想是二年级吧……但我从未有机会继续下去。”

"Why?"

The young man sighed and said, "I nearly drowned… One of my classmates, a bully really, took me by the hairs and shoved me down underwater. I don't how long, but I blacked out before the teachers cut it out and then they sent me home."  
年轻人叹了口气说道：“我差点淹死……一个同学，其实是个恶霸，抓住我的头发把我按进水里。我不知道过了多久，但在老师把我们拉开之前我就昏过去了，然后他们就让我回家了。”

Asuka blinked. "Oh."

"That's why from there I had a hard time trying to swim… That's why I'm a bit afraid of going to the deep end."  
“这就是为什么我后来学游泳很困难……这也是为什么我有点害怕去深水区。”

The redhead nodded. "I see. C'mon, I'll teach you to how to hold your breath underwater."  
红发人点点头。“我明白了。来吧，我来教你如何在水中屏住呼吸。”

"Okay," Shinji agreed. "How?"  
“好的，”真嗣同意道，“怎么做？”

"Simple. You take a deep breath, then dunk yourself down and count to ten with your fingers. If you can do that, then we go by twenty seconds, then thirty, until you might be able to hold it in a minute. Through all that, however, you'll have to blow bubbles and try to open your eyes."  
“简单。你深吸一口气，然后把自己浸到水里，用手指头数到十。如果你能做到，我们就延长到二十秒，再三十秒，直到你可能能憋气一分钟。不过，在这过程中，你得吹泡泡，并试着睁开眼睛。”

Shinji smiled. "Sounds good."  
真嗣笑了笑。“听起来不错。”

Asuka nodded. "Let's get started, then. Take a deep breath."  
明日香点点头。“那我们开始吧。深呼吸。”

The young man followed suit by inhaling as hard as he can, his mouth shut tight.  
年轻人也跟着做，尽可能深吸一口气，紧闭双唇。

"Good," Asuka approved, "and then… Now."  
“很好，”明日香赞许道，“然后……现在。”

In unison they went under, crouching down and close to the bottom, but Shinji, at first, shut his eyes upon sinking, and then because he'd been in LCL many times he opened his eyes to see for himself; it looked blurry as he stared at Asuka, who gestured at him to count down from ten with their fingers. As he watched her count, he willed himself to hold his breath as long in those ten seconds, blowing bubbles occasionally, until Asuka gestured to him again to rise and catch some air.  
他们齐声潜入水中，蹲下身子贴近底部，但一开始，真嗣在下沉时闭上了眼睛，随后因为多次身处 LCL 中，他睁开眼睛想亲自看看；他盯着明日香，视线模糊，明日香示意他用手指从十倒数。他看着她数数，努力让自己在这十秒内屏住呼吸，偶尔吹出泡泡，直到明日香再次示意他浮上去呼吸空气。

Upon breaking through the surface, both Children gasped for air, and Asuka said, "How do you feel?"  
当他们破水而出时，两个孩子都急促地喘息着，明日香问道：“感觉如何？”

"I'm getting started," Shinji answered.  
“我开始适应了，”真嗣回答。

Asuka grinned. "Good, we're going for twenty," she said, before taking another deep breath, and went under once more until after twenty seconds; and repeated the same routine, adding more ten seconds until Shinji was able to muster himself to hold down for a minute and thirty seconds.  
明日香咧嘴一笑。“好，我们这次要挑战二十秒，”她说着，深吸一口气，再次潜入水中，直到二十秒后才浮上来；然后重复同样的流程，每次增加十秒，直到真嗣能够鼓起勇气，坚持潜入水中一分三十秒。

This time Shinji was breathing in deeply, gasping loudly after they came to the surface. "How long?"  
这次真嗣深吸一口气，浮出水面后大声喘息。“多久了？”

"A minute and forty," Asuka said cheerfully between breaths. "You're doing great."  
“一分四十秒，”明日香在喘息间愉快地说道，“你做得很好。”

Shinji looked glad; he felt proud of himself getting that far. "Thanks!" he exclaimed.  
真嗣看起来很高兴；他为自己能走到这一步感到自豪。“谢谢！”他大声说道。

"Okay, we'll move on to floating," she said, but then pointed out to a spot two meters away from them, where there was a marker denoting one-and-a-half meters of water.  
“好的，我们接下来练习漂浮，”她说着，指向他们两米外的一个标记，那里标示着一米半的水深。

Just when they were about to climb up the stairs, right up to Rei's home, Kaworu gestured to the girl to pause, and he said, "I just want to teach you something."  
就在他们即将登上楼梯，直达绫波的家时，渚突然示意女孩停下，并说道：“我只想教你一些东西。”

"What is it?" Rei asked as the young man let the backpack drop to his left hand. He'd been carrying it ever since they came from the O-Club and passed by his quarters to pick it up. She wondered at first what was inside, but decided that it must be unimportant, probably containing his toiletries or spare clothes, just as she did once when she had to do physical education with the rest of the class.  
“这是什么？”丽问道，年轻男子将背包换到左手放下。自从他们从 O 俱乐部出来，经过他的宿舍去取包后，他就一直背着它。她起初好奇里面是什么，但后来觉得应该不重要，可能装着他的洗漱用品或换洗衣物，就像她曾经为了上体育课和班上其他同学一起时所带的那样。

Kaworu pointed at a small warehouse just besides the apartment building, with its sliding door ajar. "Come with me," he intoned.  
薰指向公寓楼旁边的一个小仓库，滑动门半开着。“跟我来，”他平静地说道。

They walked in until they were standing in the middle of the empty space, surrounded by corrugated boxes of what appeared to be supplies for the demolition crew; the only light present was a pair of white LED bulbs right above their heads.  
他们走进去，站在空旷的中央，四周堆满了看似是拆除队物资的波纹纸箱；唯一的光源是头顶上的一对白色 LED 灯泡。

Facing Rei, Kaworu said, "Have you discovered your AT Field? Or even tried to use it?"  
面对丽，渚薰问道：“你发现自己的 AT 力场了吗？或者尝试过使用它吗？”

The First Children shook her head. "No."  
第一适格者摇了摇头。“没有。”

"But you have potential."  
“但你拥有潜力。”

For a moment Rei thought of this, before she said, "How?"  
有那么一刻，丽想到了这一点，然后她问道：“怎么做？”

Kaworu sighed. "Limitation is only in the mind," he said. "As you're made from Lilith and you're also her vessel, you can do _almost everything_ with the AT Field, which is why I must show you the way to use the Field to your advantage."  
渚薰叹了口气。“限制只存在于心中，”他说，“既然你是从莉莉丝身上诞生的，并且也是她的容器，你几乎可以用 AT 力场做任何事情，这就是为什么我必须向你展示如何利用力场来获得优势。”

Rei nodded… and smiled softly. "Show me, then."  
丽点点头……然后温柔地笑了。“那就教我吧。”

"Okay," Kaworu said. "See those cans there?" The young man pointed at a pair of empty and upright coffee cans near the wall, several meters away from where they were standing. "Now, the first thing you do is to close your eyes and try to concentrate."  
“好的，”渚薰说道，“看到那边的罐子了吗？”年轻人指向墙边一对空置且直立的咖啡罐，距离他们站立的地方有几米远。“首先，你要闭上眼睛，试着集中注意力。”

He then closed his eyes and breathed deeply, giving himself a few moments to bring up his AT Field to strength, but not too powerful enough that he could produce a blip detectable by NERV's sensitive array of hidden energy sensors planted around Hakone.  
随后，他闭上眼睛，深呼吸，给自己几秒钟时间将 AT 力场增强，但又不至于强大到能被 NERV 在箱根周围布置的敏感能量传感器阵列探测到。

Kaworu now opened his eyes and focused at one of the cans. "Try to focus on the object you want to move, and then picture it coming to you."  
渚薰此时睁开眼睛，盯住其中一个罐子。“试着专注于你想要移动的物体，然后想象它向你移动过来。”

The can began to shake slightly, and then in an act that would be construed as a form of magic, the can slowly rose off the floor, before flying towards Kaworu in mid-air until he could reach out and grasp it in his right hand. He then turned to Rei, smiled and said, "That's what I learned before I came here."  
罐子开始微微颤动，随后，在一幕可被视为魔法的行为中，罐子缓缓从地板上升起，向半空中的渚薰飞去，直到他伸出右手将其握住。接着，他转向绫波，微笑着说：“这是我来这里之前学会的。”

For a moment Rei looked at her palms, and wondered if she could do it.  
绫波一时看着自己的手掌，思索着自己是否也能做到。

"Now, you try," Kaworu added as he set the can on the floor besides his feet. "Just concentrate carefully. Be subtle."  
“现在，你试试，”渚薰将罐子放在脚边的地板上，补充道，“只需集中精神，要细腻。”

Rei closed her eyes slowly, before, in imitation of Kaworu, took a deep breath, letting all of herself concentrate into the very core of her heart, and then in her mind's eye saw a ring of light issue away from her, like a ripple in a calm pond. This light lit the darkness before her, revealing the objects right in front, much in the same way a sonar wave hit an underwater obstacle, before the can she sought to manipulate glinted brightly.  
丽慢慢地闭上了眼睛，模仿着渚，深吸了一口气，让所有的注意力都集中到内心的最深处，然后在她的脑海中，看到一道光环从她身上发出，就像平静池塘中的一圈涟漪。这道光驱散了她面前的黑暗，揭示了正前方的物体，就像声纳波击中水下障碍物一样，她想要操控的罐子随即闪耀着明亮的光芒。

Her eyelids fluttered, energies now concentrated on the can, and as if she picked it up, the can levitated, powered by her will, before she formed her hands into a bowl and, by a blink of an eye, the can dropped in.  
她的眼睑微微颤动，能量现在集中在罐子上，仿佛她把它捡了起来，罐子在她的意志驱动下悬浮起来，然后她将双手形成一个碗状，眨眼间，罐子就落入了其中。

Now, blinking repeatedly, Rei couldn't believe it; she was astonished by what she was able to do. She turned to Kaworu, holding the can in her hand, and said, "I… I did it."  
现在，丽不停地眨眼，无法相信这一切；她对自己能做到的事情感到震惊。她转向渚，手里拿着罐子，说道：“我……我做到了。”

What words of triumph they were, and this time Kaworu grinned. "I told you can."  
"多么胜利的话语，这一次，渚薰露出了笑容。“我说过你能做到。””

Rei smiled in return, finally discovering her newfound potential. "What else I could do?"  
"绫波零回以微笑，终于发掘出自己的新潜力。“我还能做什么？””

"Generate a defensive AT Field," he answered.  
"“生成一个防御性的 AT 力场，”他回答道。”

At this hour in the HQ lobby, the only ones up around besides Misato and Makoto , as they held their tall cups of black coffee while sitting on the stools, were the two storekeepers running the Lawson's joint; and just a few meters away, the security troopers were hanging around the information desk, talking to the lone night staffer stationed there.  
在这个时间点的总部大厅，除了美里和真琴之外，还醒着的只有那两位经营罗森便利店的店主；他们手持高脚杯，坐在吧台旁，杯中盛着黑咖啡。不远处，几名安保人员正围在信息台旁，与那名孤独的夜班工作人员交谈。

"So, what do you want to talk about?" Makoto asked. "You okay this time?"  
“那么，你想聊些什么？”真琴问道，“这次你还好吗？”

Misato paused for a moment to punch out the aspirin from the blister pack and popped it into her mouth, before she took a sip of the brew to wash it down and swallowed.  
美里停顿片刻，从铝箔包装中挤出一片阿司匹林，放入口中，随后喝了一口咖啡助其吞咽。

"Yeah," she answered. "I'm feeling bothered about something… I mean, it seems that everything's coming together, but what I don't know is… Is it really going to happen, like what those old men are up to?"  
“嗯，”她回答道，“我有些心烦意乱……我是说，一切似乎都在朝着某个方向发展，但我不知道的是……这真的会发生吗，就像那些老头子们所谋划的那样？”

"We've already seen some of the evidence, but like you, I can't guess when they'll strike," Makoto replied. "But they're ready, if not making preparations to make it easier to make their wishes come true."  
“我们已经掌握了一些证据，但和你一样，我无法猜测他们何时会行动，”真琴回答，“但他们已经准备好了，如果不是正在为实现他们的愿望而做准备的话。”

Misato groaned as she paused to ponder, letting the information in her mind swirl around, trying to recall everything she knew, and then attempt to join the pieces together in an imaginary jigsaw puzzle.  
美里呻吟着停下思考，让脑海中的信息旋转、翻腾，试图回忆起她所知道的一切，然后尝试在想象的拼图游戏中将这些碎片拼凑起来。

_A lot of coincidences,_ she thought, her eyes narrowing. _All of it goes back to SEELE and the Commander... But, hell, even if we manage to stop Commander Ikari, SEELE would still put their plan in motion, and with so much they could throw at us, except the Evas are the only ones standing in their way._  
太多的巧合了，她想，眼睛眯了起来。这一切都追溯到 SEELE 和指挥官……但是，见鬼，即使我们设法阻止了碇司令，SEELE 仍会推进他们的计划，而且他们有那么多手段可以对付我们，除了 EVA 是我们唯一的阻碍。

_Yeah, whoever they are, and if we could find_ _this other mole and catch him… That mole might have any knowledge of the day they'll attack; there's no way he'll do all of this on his own without any coordination with SEELE. It has to be perfectly timed, and why not?_  
是啊，不管他们是谁，如果我们能找到另一个内鬼并抓住他……那个内鬼可能知道他们攻击的日期；他不可能在没有与 SEELE 协调的情况下独自完成这一切。这必须精确计时，为什么不呢？

Misato shook her head. _What about Kaworu? He's also an agent, but in the end he's as much as a tool for this Lorenz, in the same way Rei was made as a servant for Commander Ikari, and he's trying to break away from their control._  
美里摇了摇头。那渚薰呢？他也是个间谍，但最终他只是洛伦兹的工具，就像丽被制造出来服务于碇司令一样，而他正试图摆脱他们的控制。

_All because of love. Yeah…  
一切皆因爱而起。是啊……_

Suddenly her eyes flew open, and at the same time her hangover was dissipated.  
突然，她的眼睛猛地睁开，与此同时，宿醉感也消散了。

_Wait a second… If that mole could be talking with SEELE, then has Kaworu made any contact with these fogies? Is it still possible? If he needed to show some loyalty to these bastards, he has to talk, but where? There's no way in this place for him to simply bring out his phone and dial their number__, he'll be compromised in no time. It has to be somewhere…_  
等等……如果那个痣能和 SEELE 对话，那么渚薰有没有和这些老家伙接触过？还有可能吗？如果他需要向这些混蛋展示忠诚，他必须说话，但在哪里？在这个地方，他不可能简单地拿出手机拨他们的号码，他很快就会被识破。一定得找个地方……

Misato recalled that several times since he arrived, Kaworu went outside, ostensibly to catch some fresh air, or to visit Rei, or to meditate.  
美里记得自从他来到这里后，薰有好几次外出，表面上是为了呼吸新鲜空气，或是去拜访丽，或是去冥想。

_That does it,_ Misato finally told herself, and so without warning she grabbed Makoto by the wrist and then yanked as she abruptly moved.  
就这样决定了，美里终于对自己说，于是她毫无预兆地抓住真琴的手腕，然后猛地一拉，突然移动。

"What that hell…?" Makoto stammered, blinking. "Where are we going?"  
“搞什么鬼…？”真琴结结巴巴地说，眨了眨眼。“我们要去哪儿？”

"I got it!" Misato exclaimed. "Let's ask the info desk, he might have something about Nagisa's movements."  
"我明白了！" 美里兴奋地说，"我们去问咨询台，他可能知道渚的动向。"

The next thing she was standing before the desk staffer, who looked surprised at seeing Misato with a determined face, staring back at him as she flashed her ID card.  
紧接着，她站在了服务台前的工作人员面前，对方看到美里带着坚定的表情，回望着她并亮出了自己的身份证件，显得有些惊讶。

"Wha… What can I do for you, Colonel?" he asked, reading off her ID card.  
"呃……上校，我能为您做些什么？" 他问道，边读着她的身份证件。"

"Corporal, do you have any records of Kaworu Nagisa's times of entry and exit in your logs?" Misato demanded as she put away the card.  
"下士，你这里有记录碇真嗣的出入时间吗？"美里一边收起卡片一边质问道。

Going to his workstation and on the computer, the staffer quickly typed in Kaworu's full name and hit the Enter key to search all records concerning him. Instantly the query program spat out a list onscreen, which showed Kaworu indeed went outside, and the most telling was his unusual excursion in the dead of early morning, which was a few days ago, the day when Unit-01 went haywire on Rei.  
工作人员走到工作站，在电脑上迅速输入了真嗣的全名，按下回车键搜索所有与他相关的记录。查询程序立刻在屏幕上列出了一份清单，显示真嗣确实外出过，最引人注目的是他在清晨时分的一次不寻常出行，就在几天前，零号机失控的那天。

Misato and Makoto stared at each other, and then she said, "I think now is his opportunity to make contact again."  
美里和真看了彼此一眼，然后她说道："我想现在是他再次接触的好机会。"

"What do you mean?" Makoto asked as his boss pulled him away from the counter, and from earshot.  
“你什么意思？”真琴问道，他的老板把他从柜台旁拉开，远离了听觉范围。

"Listen to me," Misato whispered into his ear. "To make himself more credible to his masters, Kaworu has to come out, try to link up and report back with whatever he'd seen here."  
“听我说，”美里在他耳边低语，“为了让他的主子们更信任他，薰必须现身，试图联系并汇报他在这里看到的一切。”

Makoto blinked. "Is he about to turn against us?"  
真琴眨了眨眼。“他这是要背叛我们吗？”

Misato shook her head. "We'll never know, even though he swears that he's no longer in their control, but the thing is, he must show some loyalty, to assure them that their plans, whatever the hell they are, are being acted on."  
美里摇了摇头。“我们永远不会知道，尽管他发誓不再受他们控制，但问题是，他必须表现出一些忠诚，以确保他们的计划，不管是什么鬼计划，正在被实施。”

"And where we find him?"  
“那我们在哪里找到他？”

The woman upraised her finger. "There's one more thing," she said, going back to the desk staffer, and commanded, "I need a line to Director Hamamoto."  
那位女士举起手指。“还有一件事，”她说着回到办公桌前，命令道，“我需要与滨本导演通话。”

The clerk gave her the phone and Misato dialed the old man's number. After several rings Hamamoto picked it up and said, "Hello?"  
店员将电话递给她，美里拨通了那位老人的号码。几声铃响后，羽茂接起电话，问道：“喂？”

"Katsuragi here, sir," Misato replied.  
“葛城在此，长官，”美里回答道。

"Yeah, what's up, Colonel?" Hamamoto sounded surprised. "We're still trying to figure out where this fucking mole is cooped up in."  
“嗯，有什么事吗，上校？”羽茂听起来有些惊讶。“我们还在设法找出那该死的鼹鼠藏身何处。”

"A mole could do anything," Misato said. "If you have an insider, what he'll do apart from spying and cracking safes?"  
"鼹鼠能做任何事，"美里说。"如果有内鬼，除了间谍和破解保险箱，他还能做什么？"

"He can do some sabotage work," Hamamoto answered.  
"他可以进行一些破坏工作，"滨本回答道。"

Misato nodded. "That's right, sir, and what he'll hit should he has the tools to do so?"  
美里点头。"没错，长官，如果他有工具，他会攻击什么呢？"

Hamamoto let off a groan, as if a sordid idea finally hit him hard. "The worst he'll try to do to bring us down are our vital installations: communication lines, power, water, air… anything mission-critical that can be destroyed with well-placed explosives, even with some fertilizer, diesel fuel, and an improvised detonator and timer."  
Hamamoto 发出一声呻吟，仿佛一个肮脏的念头终于重重地击中了他。“他最可能用来击垮我们的手段是我们的关键设施：通讯线路、电力、水源、空气……任何可以用精心放置的炸药摧毁的，哪怕是一些化肥、柴油和自制的引爆器和定时器。”

"Are you going to act on it?" Misato asked.  
“你打算采取行动吗？”美里问道。

"Damn right we have to!" Hamamoto exclaimed, and Misato could hear what seemed to be some rustling in the background, the old man presumably getting his coat and holster on. "Looks like we could do something constructive this time, Colonel."  
“当然要行动！”Hamamoto 大声说道，美里能听到背景中似乎有窸窣声，老人大概正在穿上外套和枪套。“看来这次我们能做些有建设性的事情了，上校。”

Misato grinned.

"As soon as you go on your way," Hamamoto said, "I'd better start asking the boys to go check every installation and generation plant we have here with each team with a sniffer dog and anything to find and defuse a bomb or something. That way, I think we could get the sonofabitch easy by smoking him out of his hidey-hole once he finds out we fuck up his plan to celebrate New Year with plastic explosives."  
"你一出发，" 滨本说，"我最好开始让小伙子们去检查我们这里的每一个设施和发电厂，每个小组都带上嗅探犬，还有任何能找到并拆除炸弹的东西。这样一来，我想我们可以轻松逮到那个混蛋，一旦他发现我们破坏了他用塑料炸药庆祝新年的计划，我们就把他从藏身之处熏出来。"

"Good idea, sir," Misato said, amused by the man's colorful language.  
"好主意，长官，" 美里说，被这个人的生动语言逗乐了。"

"Once this is over, Colonel," Hamamoto said, "I'll take you and any buddies you have to any dive you want at Odawara, even if I have to blow my month's salary on a dozen fish heads. All drinks are on me."  
"一旦这事结束，上校，" 滨本说，"我会带你和你的任何朋友去小田原的任何一家小酒馆，哪怕我得花掉一个月的薪水买一打鱼头。所有酒水都算我的。"

Misato chuckled. "Thank you sir."  
美里轻声笑道：“谢谢您，长官。”

"My pleasure. At least you finally made me break out of this damned rut, so I'll see you later… Hopefully with the sonofabitch dangling from the scaffold like freshly-caught blue marlin. Thank you, Colonel," Hamamoto said before he put down the phone, and then Misato turned to Makoto.  
“乐意之至。至少你终于让我摆脱了这个该死的困境，回头见……希望到时候那混蛋像刚钓上来的蓝枪鱼一样挂在架子上。谢谢你，上校，”滨本说完挂了电话，随后美里转向真琴。

"Well?" the bespectacled junior officer asked.  
“那么？”戴眼镜的年轻军官问道。

"He's up and running, so I think it's time for us to watch what Kaworu could do," Misato said as they walked towards the direction of the parking lot. Meanwhile the guards who were lounging around suddenly heard their handheld radios crackling, with Hamamoto issuing prompt orders.  
“他已经起身奔跑了，我想我们该看看渚能做些什么。”美里说着，朝停车场的方向走去。与此同时，那些原本闲散的守卫突然听到手中的无线电发出噼啪声，是滨元在发出紧急指令。

Surprisingly, no more than an hour of swimming basics did Shinji now dared himself to submerge for half a minute, as Asuka watched him underwater. She wondered what spurred him to break away his fears and to become this confident, and to learn so much. Her presence, perhaps?  
令人惊讶的是，仅仅一个小时的游泳基础训练后，真嗣就敢让自己潜入水中半分钟，而明日香在水下看着他。她想知道是什么促使他克服恐惧，变得如此自信，并学到了这么多。或许是她的存在？

Asuka remembered how from time to time she would badger Shinji, sometimes in an offensive manner, to demean him and to show that she was better, but as well as to get his game face on. But since the attempt on her life it seemed that Shinji was reasserting the way how he was trying to cope with the harsh reality of the world around him.  
明日香记得自己时不时会挑衅真嗣，有时甚至带有攻击性，贬低他以显示自己更优秀，同时也是为了激发他的斗志。但在她遭遇生命威胁后，真嗣似乎在重新调整自己应对周围残酷现实的方式。

She could never forget the look on his face, when he finally broke through and picked up the gun to wade into the fight with both fists clenched.  
她永远忘不了他最终突破自我、紧握双拳拿起枪投身战斗时的表情。

That was amazing, and why not?  
那真是太棒了，为什么不呢？

He loved her this time, and no longer did they have to furtively and reluctantly trying to settle their differences, no longer did they were in conflict, but somewhere they attuned themselves to the same wavelength.  
这次他深爱着她，不再需要偷偷摸摸、不情愿地试图解决分歧，不再有冲突，而是找到了共鸣的频率。

It was their respective and sordid past lives that finally allowed them to transcend their initial prejudices… and Shinji's newfound courage now gave Asuka a renewed measure of making peace with the past, and to look to the future with hope in her heart.  
正是他们各自不堪的过往，最终让他们超越了最初的偏见……而真嗣新获得的勇气，现在给了明日香重新与过去和解的契机，让她心中怀揣希望，展望未来。

Well, she was no longer alone; they were for each other, for even hedgehogs can mate.  
好吧，她不再孤单；他们彼此相依，即便是刺猬也能交配。

And once they went back to the surface, Shinji asked, "How many seconds?"  
当他们回到地面后，真嗣问道：“多少秒？”

"Over a minute," Asuka answered between her breaths, smiling despite herself as she kicked her feet underwater to stay afloat. "I'm still surprised."  
"超过一分钟了，" 明日香在水中踢腿保持漂浮的同时，喘着气回答，尽管如此还是忍不住笑了。"我还是挺惊讶的。"

Shinji grinned, his head bobbing above the surface, the water eddying around him. "I'm just following your lead."  
真嗣咧嘴一笑，头在水面上起伏，水流在他周围打着旋。"我只是跟着你的节奏。"

"Okay, one last," Asuka dared, before she took a deep breath, dived back in, and Shinji followed suit by doing the same procedure.  
"好吧，最后一次，" 明日香鼓起勇气说，然后深吸一口气，再次潜入水中，真嗣也跟着重复同样的动作。

Underwater once more, Shinji kept himself still, letting a few bubbles float away from the corner of his mouth as Asuka swam towards him. For a few seconds they stared at each other's eyes, before their lips touched and then locked down in a kiss, sharing some of their breath, the outside world ignored in their bliss.  
再次潜入水下，真嗣保持静止，任由几个气泡从嘴角飘走，而明日香向他游来。几秒钟内，他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，随后双唇相触并紧紧相贴，共享着呼吸，在幸福的时刻中忽略了外界的一切。

As they kissed, his hands glided over her shoulders, holding Asuka gently as her palms held on to his waist. They kept on, counting seconds in their minds, but they wanted to let the moment last longer… yet somehow each second seemed to be an hour, but no, almost an eternity.  
当他们亲吻时，他的手轻轻滑过她的肩膀，温柔地拥抱着明日香，而她的手掌则紧贴在他的腰间。他们继续着，心中默默计算着秒数，但他们希望这一刻能更长久……然而不知为何，每一秒都仿佛一小时，不，几乎是一个永恒。

Shinji's feelings were mixed, an intoxicating cocktail of ecstasy, joy, gladness, redemption, and triumph, this blissful moment a culmination of a long life of loneliness, followed by interaction with people over time; they all shaped him into the man he was now, for better or for worse. He could now feel the beating of his heart in the ears, like a big taiko drum being pounded enthusiastically, his soul celebrating a personal achievement, a _matsuri no ai_… a festival of love held in the sun-dappled avenue of his mind. He could imagine the loud chanting in his mind's ears, a dim memory of the past, when as a young boy on the sidelines with his uncle he watched the parade pass by, the wooden shrine being held up and down on shoulders by hachimaki-wearing men in colorful yukatas: _WA-SHO! WA-SHO! WA-SHO! WA-SHO!_  
真嗣的心情复杂交织，犹如一杯令人陶醉的鸡尾酒，混合着狂喜、欢乐、喜悦、救赎与胜利，这一刻的幸福是漫长孤独生活的顶点，随后与人们的交往逐渐塑造了他，无论是好是坏。他现在能感受到耳边心脏的跳动，宛如一面大太鼓被热情地敲击，他的灵魂在庆祝个人的成就，一场心灵的祭典……一场在阳光斑驳的心灵大道上举行的爱的庆典。他仿佛能听到脑海中响亮的吟唱，那是过去的模糊记忆，当他还是个孩子，和叔叔一起站在路边观看游行时，木制神轿在戴着头巾、身着五彩浴衣的男人们肩上起起落落：WA-SHO！WA-SHO！WA-SHO！WA-SHO！

He felt hard at the same time, feeling eager and inflamed, and suddenly he couldn't wait any longer, so Shinji looked into Asuka's eyes once more, gestured to her to surface back, and once they broke through the water, breathing in the air in gasps, Shinji was hungry.  
他同时感到坚硬，充满了渴望和激情，突然间他再也等不及了，于是真嗣再次凝视着明日香的双眼，示意她浮上水面，当他们破水而出，喘息着吸入空气时，真嗣感到饥饿。

As if like telepathy, Asuka knew what her lover wanted, and like there was no tomorrow, they swam towards the edge of the pool, climbed out of the water, and scurried towards a row of chaise lounges. Asuka laid herself down on one of them, her face glistening with dripping water drops, framed with a smile, cheeks blushing, as Shinji was now on all fours over her body.  
仿佛心有灵犀，明日香知道她的爱人想要什么，仿佛没有明天一般，他们向泳池边缘游去，爬出水面，匆匆走向一排躺椅。明日香躺在了其中一张上，她的脸庞闪烁着滴落的水珠，带着微笑，双颊泛红，而真嗣此时正四肢着地在她上方。

They paused for a moment, eyes locked to one another as they breathed in shallow huffs, wondering who should make the first move; Asuka expecting Shinji to go first because he was the man of the moment, but Shinji thought Asuka should be first because he thought she had more experience, but then...  
他们停顿了一会儿，目光紧紧相锁，呼吸急促而浅，思考着谁该先采取行动；明日香期待真嗣先开始，因为他此刻是主角，但真嗣认为明日香应该先来，因为他觉得她更有经验，然而……

"What are you waiting for?" Asuka finally questioned, breaking the impasse.  
“你在等什么？”明日香终于打破僵局问道。

Shinji chuckled. "Why not?" he said.  
真嗣轻声笑了。“为什么不呢？”他说。

"To hell with the world," she answered, before Shinji kissed her deep, as the girl struggled to unfasten her bra with a free hand…  
“去他的世界，”她回答道，随后真嗣深深地吻了她，女孩挣扎着用一只手解开胸罩……

Back at the warehouse, Kaworu now stood just a few meters away from Rei, having instructed her to pick up a stone. He then said, "Just throw the rock at me."  
回到仓库，渚薰现在站在离绫波只有几米远的地方，他指示她捡起一块石头。然后他说：“把石头扔向我。”

Rei blinked in hesitation.  
丽犹豫地眨了眨眼。

"Harder, as though you threw the Spear just like before."  
“用力点，就像你之前投掷长矛那样。”

"But…"

Kaworu grinned. "Don't worry about me, I can take it even if you hit me on the head."  
渚薰笑了笑。“别担心我，就算你打中我的头也没事。”

Without a word, Rei nodded. She first concentrated at her target without hesitation, and she readied the stone, clenched in her hand, and flung it hard at Kaworu like a Hanshin Tigers fastball. Instantly the stone, just it was about to strike into Kaworu's midsection, was pulverized into dust when his defensive AT Field caught it, a bluish hexagonal ripple forming away from the moment of impact.  
一言不发，丽点了点头。她首先毫不犹豫地集中注意力于目标，紧握手中的石头，用力向薰投掷过去，宛如阪神虎队的快速直球。就在石头即将击中薰的腹部时，他的防御性 AT 力场瞬间将其粉碎成尘埃，一道蓝色的六边形波纹在撞击瞬间形成并扩散开来。

"This is how you defend yourself," Kaworu said, as he walked towards Rei. "Your mind must anticipate any possible danger, which then the AT Field you generate would create a perimeter where you could then sense an incoming, harmful object that could possibly hurt you."  
“这就是你自卫的方式，”薰边说边向丽走去。“你的心必须预见任何可能的危险，然后你生成的 AT 力场会在你周围形成一个区域，让你能够感知到可能伤害你的来袭物体。”

"Which means I must imagine this perimeter with my own mind," Rei said.  
“这意味着我必须用我的思维去想象这个区域，”丽说道。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, you can create this 'magic circle'. Now, it's your turn."  
渚薰点头。“是的，你可以创造这个‘魔法阵’。现在，轮到你了。”

Rei walked back a few yards, away from Kaworu, who then picked up another stone.  
绫波零向后退了几步，远离渚薰，后者随即捡起另一块石头。

"First," Rei said, closing her eyes, "I imagine this circle."  
“首先，”绫波说，闭上眼睛，“我设想这个圆阵。”

"Yes," Kaworu replied. "Can you feel it now?"  
"是的，"渚薰回答道。"你现在能感觉到吗？"

Rei nodded in response; she could sense the energy emanating from the core of her very being, which then expanded and radiated outwards.  
绫波零点了点头回应；她能感受到从自己核心散发出的能量，然后这股能量向外扩展并辐射开来。

"Now open your eyes, but maintain your concentration," Kaworu said, and then he lobbed the stone, right into Rei's stomach where it was supposed to hit her. Her mind awaiting the stone, the AT Field she generated immediately reacted upon contact and blasted the stone out of existence, leaving a cloud of dust floating before her.  
"现在睁开眼睛，但保持你的专注，"渚薰说道，然后他将石头投向绫波的腹部，正是它应该击中的地方。她的意识等待着石头的到来，她生成的 AT 力场在接触的瞬间立即做出反应，将石头炸成虚无，留下一团尘埃悬浮在她面前。

"See," Kaworu said, silently applauding Rei for doing it right the first time. "Was it hard?"  
"看，" 渚薰说，默默地为绫波零第一次就做对了而鼓掌。"很难吗？"

Rei shook her head, but she gave him a small smile in return. "I could get used to this."  
绫波摇了摇头，但她回以一个淡淡的微笑。"我可以习惯这个。"

Kaworu sighed, and kissed her on the forehead. "Come on," he said. "You still have some tea left over?"  
渚薰叹了口气，吻了吻她的额头。"来吧，"他说。"你还有些茶剩下吗？"

"Yes," she replied as they mounted the stairs.  
"是的，" 她回答着，他们一起走上楼梯。

---

Suddenly, Shinji hesitated, prompting Asuka to frown.  
突然，真嗣犹豫了一下，这让明日香皱起了眉头。

"What?" she demanded. Both of them were now naked, their wet underwear tossed aside, and of course their cheeks were still flaming red.  
"怎么了？" 她质问道。两人都已赤裸，湿漉漉的内衣被扔在一边，当然，他们的脸颊依然通红。

"Uh… I… I've never done this before," he replied, sounding doubtful.  
"呃…我…我以前从没做过这个，"他回答道，语气中带着怀疑。

The redhead laughed out loud. "So do I, dummy! You think we're going too far? We're about to start!"  
红发女孩放声大笑。"我也是，傻瓜！你觉得我们走得太远了吗？我们才刚刚开始呢！"

"No… Uh," Shinji stammered before he stared down to his quivering rocket ship hovering over her Black Forest in blazing autumn red. His mind was whirling with what-ifs, wondering if he could accidentally make Asuka pregnant.  
"不…呃，"真嗣结巴着说，然后低头看着自己颤抖的火箭船悬停在她那片燃烧着秋日红火的黑森林上空。他的脑海中充满了各种假设，担心自己会不会不小心让明日香怀孕。

Asuka sighed. "Look, if your concern is making me pregnant," she said, "I don't care if I become a mother, I don't care if I'll have to go through childbirth... I'll live with that, too, even if Misato gets mad at us for shagging should she catches us. I'll take the responsibility, and I promise you that I'll not be like Mama."  
明日香叹了口气。“听着，如果你担心的是让我怀孕，”她说，“我不在乎是否成为母亲，不在乎是否要经历分娩……我也会接受这一切，即使美里因为我们做爱而生气，如果她抓到我们的话。我会承担责任，我向你保证我不会像妈妈那样。”

"I've made up my mind now," Shinji answered. "I think there's no point of return for me."  
“我已经下定决心了，”真嗣回答。“我想对我来说已经没有回头路了。”

"You mean _us_."

"Yeah. I have to be a man. I have to take responsibility, too."  
“是啊。我必须成为一个男人。我也必须承担责任。”

Now Asuka smiled. "Let's not make it quick," she said softly. "First of all, be slow… Kiss me slowly on the neck, then you work your way down. Don't enter unless I say so."  
此刻，明日香微笑了。“别急，慢慢来，”她轻声说道，“首先，要慢……温柔地吻我的脖子，然后慢慢向下。除非我允许，否则不要进入。”

Shinji managed a hard swallow, steeling himself to go forth.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，鼓起勇气继续前进。

"Okay," he whispered, before his lips touched the skin of her neck.  
“好，”他低语着，双唇轻触她颈间的肌肤。

The lab was always Ritsuko's second home, which was why she stashed in some of her clothes and personal necessities in closets, and by the time they got inside, Maya went ahead and pulled out a foldable cot from the closet and set it up, before tossing in a blanket and a pillow on top; her boss was used to work so late that she had to spend the rest of the night in the lab, and she did so in a Spartan manner.  
实验室总是律子的第二个家，这也是为什么她在柜子里藏了一些衣物和个人必需品。当她们进入实验室时，玛雅先行一步，从柜子里拉出一张折叠床并展开，然后扔上一床毯子和一个枕头；她的上司习惯于工作到深夜，以至于不得不在实验室度过余下的夜晚，而且她是以一种斯巴达式的简朴方式这么做。

As Ritsuko prepared her mug of coffee for the two of them, Maya said, "I'll leave later."  
当律子为两人准备咖啡时，玛雅说：“我稍后会离开。”

"Why?" the older woman asked.  
“为什么？”年长的女人问道。

"I just want to hang around a little longer," Maya answered as she sat down on an empty chair. "There's nothing waiting for me by the time I get there."  
"我只是想多待一会儿，" 真嗣回答道，她坐在一张空椅子上。"我回去也没什么等着我。"

"Ah, I see."

For a while there was silence between the two once the women took their mugs of coffee and sipped, as they still felt the slight hangover from drinking a few bottles of beer and five-percenter alco-pop.  
两人拿起咖啡杯啜饮，一时间陷入了沉默，她们仍能感受到昨晚喝了几瓶啤酒和五度酒精饮料后的轻微宿醉。

"Do you wish to talk about something?" Ritsuko offered.  
"你想聊聊什么吗？" 律子提议道。

"Uh… You first, but why?" Maya wondered aloud.  
"呃…你先说，但为什么呢？" 真希波大声问道。

Ritsuko chuckled. "It's been so long that we're so busy that we haven't got a chance to talk about ourselves," she said.  
律子轻笑道："我们已经忙了这么久，连聊聊自己的机会都没有了，"她说。

"Ah," Maya said, smiling. "I guess I'll start with myself."  
"啊，" 真希波微笑着说，"我想我还是从自己开始吧。"

The lady doctor nodded. "Okay."  
女医生点了点头。"好的。"

"When I was in high school," Maya recalled, before she took a sip, "I didn't think much of romance, and back then I minded my own business. I was then okay with having no date, as I didn't want to be distracted from my studies."  
"高中时，"玛雅回忆道，喝了一口之前，"我对浪漫并不怎么在意，那时候我专注于自己的事情。我当时觉得没有约会也没关系，因为我不想被学习分心。"

"I see."

"My parents put a lot of pressure on me to finish studying, as I was the only child, and you should know that."  
"我父母对我完成学业施加了很大压力，因为我是独生女，你应该知道这一点。"

"You're just like me," Ritsuko said in agreement as she sat down on the cot. "My mother had a lot of expectations."  
"你就像我一样，" 律子赞同地说着，坐在了床铺上。"我母亲也有很多期望。"

Maya sighed. "But inside… well, I was kind of being left out in my class. I was always first, but the other girls had a better time… like they're living normal lives, and they worried a little compared to me."  
玛雅叹了口气。"但在内心……好吧，我在班上有点被孤立。我总是第一名，但其他女孩们过得更开心……就像她们过着正常的生活，相比之下，她们只担心一点点。"

"So, what do you really want?" the older woman asked.  
"那么，你真正想要的是什么？" 年长的女人问道。"

"I just wished they let a little more slack for me," Maya said, "I wished I had a date, learn a few more things other than math and chemical equations, understand the world around me, and you know, make the best of my youth."  
"我只是希望他们能对我宽松一点，" 真希波说，"我希望我能有个约会，学点除了数学和化学方程式以外的东西，了解周围的世界，你知道的，充分利用我的青春。"

"That explains why you, now out of college, have this Hello Kitty fixation," Ritsuko said before she laughed, knowing that Maya had that girly habit of affixing stickers to some of her workstation furniture, and a big themed cushion atop her chair.  
"这就解释了为什么你现在已经大学毕业了，还有这个 Hello Kitty 情结，" 律子笑着说，她知道真希波有那种少女习惯，会在一些工作站家具上贴贴纸，椅子上还放着一个大大的主题靠垫。"

"Yeah," Maya agreed, tittering. "I'm trying to make up for what I lost."  
"是啊，" 真希波笑着附和道，"我正在努力弥补我失去的。"

"Now, do you still wonder about my relationship with Kaji?"  
"现在，你还对我和加持的关系感到好奇吗？"

Maya blinked. "Him?"

"Yeah, you think there's something going on between him and me… Well, he did it to provoke Misato to bring her closer to him by making her jealous."  
"是啊，你以为我和他之间有什么……其实，他是为了激怒美里，让她因嫉妒而更接近他，才这么做的。"

"Ah, that's why he's playful, like hugging you, right?"  
"啊，所以他是故意玩闹的，比如拥抱你，对吧？"

"That's correct," Ritsuko confirmed. "But, to be honest, I'm really a friend to them as far as I'm concerned; I'm just at the sidelines back then, when they were beyond first base."  
"没错，" 律子确认道。"但说实话，在我看来，我只是他们的朋友；那时他们已经超越了最初阶段，而我只是旁观者。"

"So, you're lonely." "所以，你感到孤独。"

Ritsuko sighed. "Yeah, and so this leaves me wondering about the future. I doubt about having love at this age… that funny, fickle, hurtful, unpredictable word." She then took a deep sip, wanting to get the caffeine hit her system hard, and said, "Maya…"  
律子叹了口气。"是的，这让我对未来感到迷茫。我怀疑在这个年纪还能否拥有爱情……那个既有趣又善变、伤人且不可预测的词。" 她接着深吸一口，想要让咖啡因强烈地刺激她的系统，然后说，"真希……"

Maya blinked. "Yes?"

"I need you."

The younger junior officer blushed. "Why?"  
年轻的少尉脸红了。“为什么？”

"You're the only one left who I can trust… after all the pain and suffering and jealousy and…" Ritsuko groaned and shook her head. "…and betrayal."  
“你是唯一一个我还能信任的人……经历了所有的痛苦、苦难、嫉妒和……”律子呻吟着摇了摇头。“……还有背叛。”

Maya said nothing, except she drank her boss' words, the young woman's heart throbbing as Ritsuko turned to look into her eyes, took her hand and grasped it gently.  
玛雅没有说话，只是默默地接受了上司的话语，当律子转过身来凝视着她的眼睛，轻轻握住她的手时，年轻女子的内心悸动不已。

"Maya, if ever the world collapses around us," she said, "if ever there's nowhere to go once the typhoon, an earthquake and a tsunami hit us at the same time, at least you manage to stick along with me, through thick and thin, and for that… I thank you."  
“真嗣，如果世界在我们周围崩塌，”她轻声说，“如果台风、地震和海啸同时袭来，我们无处可逃，至少你一直陪伴在我身边，同甘共苦，为此……我衷心感谢你。”

From that point, the two women had nothing else to say, except Ritsuko leaned forward and kissed Maya on the cheek, before hugging her.  
从那一刻起，两位女性再无言语，除了律子向前倾身，在真希波的脸颊上轻轻一吻，随后拥抱了她。

While Rei prepared some tea in the kitchen, Kaworu parted the curtains and slid open the balcony doors, allowing the early morning breeze and some moonlight to filter in. Pleased, he then sat down on the edge of the girl's bed and gazed at the scene outside; beyond the ruins lay the artificial lagoon whose waters were sparkled by the rays of the moon. He could also espy the silhouette of the mountain range towering above the lake, and far off, there was the faint haze of urban lighting.  
当绫波在厨房准备茶水时，渚薰拉开窗帘，推开阳台门，让清晨的微风和月光透进来。他满意地坐在女孩床边，凝视着外面的景象；废墟之外是人工潟湖，月光下的水面波光粼粼。他还能看到湖面上方高耸的山脉轮廓，远处则是城市灯光的朦胧光晕。

Kaworu's mind then ranged back to the tavern, and immediately he felt that intoxicating high of love, of being with Rei as they danced. It was that same feeling that compelled men and women to write stories and poems in epic volumes, to paint, to sing and dance, all that to celebrate romanticism to banish, even if only for a while, the ugliness of human strife, violence, and debasement.  
加沃鲁的思绪随即飘回了那间酒馆，立刻感受到了那种令人陶醉的爱情高潮，与丽一起跳舞时的感觉。正是这种情感驱使着男女们创作出史诗般的诗歌和故事，绘画、歌唱和舞蹈，所有这些都是为了庆祝浪漫主义，哪怕只是暂时地驱散人类纷争、暴力和堕落的丑陋。

Now something struck Kaworu's mind: no longer did he read or watched fiction about people in love, but rather he and Rei experienced it first-hand, the first time on the same wavelength.  
此刻，加沃鲁心中有了新的领悟：他不再只是阅读或观看关于相爱的人们的虚构故事，而是他和丽亲身经历着这一切，第一次在同一频率上共鸣。

He then turned around to see Rei waiting for him, a teacup in each hand. Wordlessly he accepted one, before taking a careful sip as the blue-haired girl sat besides him.  
他随即转身，看到丽正等着他，双手各持一杯茶。他默默地接过一杯，小心翼翼地啜了一口，蓝发女孩随即坐在他身旁。

"I thought it so strange that we were fated to meet in this way," Kaworu said.  
"我原以为我们以这种方式相遇是命中注定的，"渚薰说道。

"Yes," Rei replied. "是的，"绫波回答道。

"Well," he said, "there's something else I noticed about Shinji's mother, especially her past as I looked into your mind and saw all that."  
"嗯，"他说，"关于真嗣的母亲，我还有其他发现，尤其是她的过去，当我窥探你的心灵并看到这一切时。

"Now that I have understood, the Commander has a reason to do everything to get her back."  
"既然我已经明白了，指挥官有理由尽一切努力把她找回来。"

"Because he thought she was the only woman who changed him completely. He really fell for her, for to him she was his salvation, a way for him to break from the past."  
"因为他认为她是唯一彻底改变他的女人。他真的爱上了她，对她来说，她是他的救赎，是他摆脱过去的一种方式。"

Rei nodded, and then made a sip from her own cup.  
丽点点头，然后从自己的杯子里喝了一口。

"Yet, in consequence, by willing herself to Eva to escape Chairman Lorenz's wrath, I think Commander Ikari was completely consumed by that loss, which explains why he conceived of this undertaking to retrieve her at any cost."  
"然而，通过自愿将她交给伊娃以逃避洛伦兹主席的怒火，我认为碇司令完全被这种失去所吞噬，这也解释了他为何不惜一切代价策划这项行动来找回她。"

"Therefore I was made in her image," Rei said. "I was to give the Commander a reminder of his life's goal."  
"因此我是按照她的形象被创造出来的，" 绫波说。"我是为了让司令时刻铭记他的人生目标。"

"That explains why at first he gave you preferential treatment as if you were his daughter," Kaworu said.  
"这就解释了为什么起初他对你特别关照，仿佛你是他的女儿，" 渚薰说。"

"That is true," Rei agreed as she took his hand. "But at the price of my brother's happiness."  
“确实如此，”丽同意道，同时握住了他的手。“但这是以我哥哥的幸福为代价的。”

"Yet look at the brighter side, especially now," Kaworu said. "Shinji found his happiness by discovering that he had much in common with Asuka, and shared everything they knew about themselves. So, why he has to waste time worrying about his father, who still regards him as a cog in a machine even up to this point, when he now has Asuka as the focus of his newfound happiness?"  
“然而，看看光明的一面，尤其是现在，”薰说道。“真嗣通过发现他与明日香有许多共同之处，分享了彼此的一切，找到了他的幸福。那么，既然他现在有了明日香作为他新发现的幸福的焦点，为什么还要浪费时间担心那个至今仍把他视为机器中一个齿轮的父亲呢？”

Rei gave him a soft smile. "It is best that we let them alone, let him experience his joy with Asuka," she said. "Right here and now, I am glad I am with you."  
丽给了他一个温柔的微笑。“我们最好让他们独处，让他与明日香一起体验他的快乐，”她说。“此时此地，我很高兴能与你在一起。”

"For having someone to talk with?" Kaworu asked.  
"因为有人可以交谈？" 渚薰问道。

"More than that." "不仅仅是那样。"

"I know."

This time the couple afforded themselves to laugh softly, before Rei paused to place her hand to touch Kaworu's cheek and said, "I want to take you."  
这次两人轻声笑了起来，随后丽停顿了一下，伸手轻触渚薰的脸颊，说道："我想带你走。"

"Where?" he asked, blinking in wonderment.  
"哪里？" 他问道，眨着眼睛，满是惊奇。

"Touch me now." "现在就触碰我。"

"You mean…" he trailed off as he watched her crawl to the middle of the bed and laid down, but immediately Kaworu finally understood what Rei was asking him to do. So he went over to her and without anything else to say he kissed her slowly.  
"你是说…" 他话音未落，只见她爬到床中央躺下，卡罗终于明白了丽在要求他做什么。于是他走向她，没有再多言，缓缓地吻了她。

They then sat upright, and Rei, acting on ancient instinct, carefully took off her shirt before she unbuttoned Kaworu's shirt and tossed both garments away. They paused for a moment, each wondering what to do next.  
随后他们坐直了身子，Rei 遵循着古老的直觉，小心翼翼地脱下自己的衬衫，接着解开 Kaworu 的衬衫扣子，将两件衣物都扔到一旁。他们停顿片刻，各自思索着下一步该做什么。

Kaworu decided that it was his turn, and began to kiss Rei again as his hands reached out and unfastened her bra. She then unbuckled and unzipped her jeans, pulled them down and cast them away onto the floor.  
Kaworu 决定轮到他了，开始再次亲吻 Rei，同时双手伸出去解开她的胸罩。接着，她解开牛仔裤的扣子，拉下拉链，将裤子脱下并扔到地板上。

Now only one piece of undergarment remained on her body, and the Fifth Children managed a hard swallow, but instantly he banished his doubts by taking off his pants. He then said, "Don't worry, Rei. I think we can do this by instinct, but... I want to do this slowly."  
现在她身上只剩下一件内衣，第五使徒艰难地咽了口唾沫，但立刻驱散了疑虑，脱下自己的裤子。然后他说：“别担心，Rei。我觉得我们可以凭直觉来做，但……我想慢慢来。”

"I agree," she said, before her fingers tugged at the hem of her panties and pulled them down to her knees.  
“我同意，”她说着，手指拉住内裤的边缘，将其拉至膝盖处。

This time Kaworu groaned in pleasure at the sight of this unexplored country, and thus instantly engorged. "I… This must what a honeymoon really looks like," he said.  
这一次，看到这片未被探索的领域，渚薰愉悦地呻吟起来，瞬间变得兴奋。“我……这一定就是蜜月的真实模样，”他说道。

Rei blinked. "Honeymoon?"  
绫波零眨了眨眼。“蜜月？”

"Something I learned while watching TV, about a couple happily married and how they spent the night after."  
从电视上学到的一件事，关于一对幸福婚姻的夫妇，以及他们夜晚之后的相处方式。

"Ah," Rei said as her mind registered the word and its definition, before Kaworu took off his boxers. Now that both Children were free of their garments, he went down upon Rei's body and began the age-old instinct of copulation.  
“啊，”丽在脑海中理解了这个词及其定义，就在这时，薰脱下了他的内裤。现在两个孩子都赤裸着身体，他俯身在丽的身上，开始了古老的交媾本能。

Once he pushed inward for the very first time, Rei gasped in pain but took it in stride, for she didn't care about being hurt this way, nor worry about the world or Commander Ikari, for she really wanted Kaworu for this one and only amorous time of their lives, personal self-discovery at the most intimate level.  
当他第一次推进时，丽因疼痛而倒吸一口气，但她从容应对，因为她不在乎以这种方式受伤，也不担心世界或碇司令，因为她真的很想与薰共度这唯一一次的亲密时光，在最为私密的层面上进行自我发现。

Sated yet completely spent, Shinji and Asuka were lying on the chaise, side by side, perspiring and gasping for deep breaths after they were able to reach the portals of heaven and he unloaded himself.  
筋疲力尽却又心满意足，真嗣和明日香并排躺在躺椅上，汗水淋漓，喘着粗气，刚刚他们一同抵达了天堂的彼岸，而他释放了自己。

Slowly Asuka looked into Shinji's eyes and she said in a soft tone, "I'm okay with this."  
明日香缓缓地凝视着真嗣的眼睛，柔声说道：“我对这一切感到满意。”

"What do you mean?" he asked, his arms draped around her.  
“你指的是什么？”他问道，双臂环绕着她。

The redhead sighed. "Before, I once used to dread the inevitability of motherhood, especially when I have this 'time of the month' thingy… I mean, going through a case of premenstrual syndrome."  
红发女孩叹了口气。“以前，我曾一度害怕成为母亲这件事，尤其是在我经历‘每个月的那几天’时……我是说，忍受经前综合症的折磨。”

"And…?"

"To make it clear," Asuka said, "I then didn't want to have kids, as I bitched about PMS and why I have to deal with it… it's because at that time I didn't want to remember Mama, and I don't want to relive that nightmare."  
“说清楚点，”明日香说道，“我当时不想生孩子，我抱怨经前综合症，为什么我得忍受这些……那是因为那时候我不想记起妈妈，我不想再经历那个噩梦。”

"What about now?" “那现在呢？”

Asuka chuckled. "I'll learn more from now on," she promised. "I mean, should I get pregnant, we'll have to learn the ropes and understand what it takes to be a parent."  
明日香轻笑一声。“从现在开始我会学得更多，”她承诺道，“我是说，万一我怀孕了，我们得学会怎么当父母，明白成为父母需要什么。”

"Perhaps… No, I mean," Shinji corrected himself, "If we ever to have children, let's not allow ourselves to repeat the mistakes of the past."  
“或许……不，我是说，”真嗣纠正自己，“如果我们将来有了孩子，让我们不要重蹈覆辙。”

The redhead nodded. "Yeah," she agreed. "You sound profound and mature this time, you dummy."  
红发女孩点点头。“嗯，”她同意道，“这次你说得很有深度，也很成熟，你这个笨蛋。”

Shinji smiled. "Thank you… By the way, what time is it?"  
真嗣微笑着。“谢谢你……对了，现在几点了？”

Asuka upraised her wrist to glance at the face of her Swatch wristwatch. "It's five minutes past two. Do you still have the card to the door?"  
明日香抬起手腕，瞥了一眼她的斯沃琪手表。“两点过五分。你还有门卡吗？”

"Yeah, it's in my pants," Shinji answered before getting up from the chaise and began to gather up their tossed clothes on the floor. "Let's get dressed before Misato comes back loaded from some sake bar out there."  
“嗯，在我裤子里，”真嗣回答着，从躺椅上起身，开始收拾地上散落的衣物。“我们赶紧穿好衣服，免得美里从外面的居酒屋喝得醉醺醺地回来。”

**Author's Notes:** I apologize to everyone that it took me waaaay too long to bring this out. Why? Too busy, busy, busy; so busy that IRL crap nearly ate up the energy I need to think and write, along with too many distractions along the way. It's only for the last two weeks that I was able to have enough time to brainstorm and then commit the story to the pages... But in reality I had the ideas for this chapter in those long months since February, fighting not to forget the scenes that I have envisioned, now in these pages.  
作者的话：我为让大家等了这么久而道歉。为什么？太忙了，忙得不可开交；现实生活中的琐事几乎耗尽了我思考和写作所需的精力，再加上一路上太多的干扰。直到最近两周，我才有足够的时间来构思并将故事付诸纸上……但实际上，自从二月份以来，这几个月里我一直努力不忘记那些我构思好的场景，现在它们终于呈现在这些页面上。

In other words, I'm not going to let this fic go the way of _Gospel of Malachiel._  
换句话说，我不会让这篇同人走向《玛拉基尔福音》的命运。

Well… I'm looking forward to the next remaining chapters before moving on to the biggie, but before I go, any C&Cs are welcome.  
嗯……我期待着接下来的剩余章节，然后才会转向更大的篇章，但在我离开之前，欢迎任何评论和建议。

_J'ai ose._

### Chapter 36 The Garden of Gethsemane  
第三十六章 客西马尼花园

Kaworu suddenly woke up, bringing himself sitting upright on the bed. His eyes squinted in the near-darkness, eyes adjusting as they sought for light. Right besides him was Rei, sleeping but under the blanket she was completely naked. He could also feel the rhythm of her breathing.  
渚薰突然醒来，坐直在床上。他的眼睛在近乎黑暗中眯起，适应着寻找光线。就在他旁边，丽正睡着，但被子下的她一丝不挂。他还能感受到她的呼吸节奏。

His mind quickly went back to the last time they were awake, as they made love, groping between each other in the dim light, kissing, caressing their sweaty skin, all the while they moaned. It was their first time, doing it as if they knew the mechanics for a very long time, and all the while Kaworu thought this was where all living existence began, the necessity of reproduction to ensure the survival of any species, but superseded, in his opinion, by this thing called love.  
他的思绪迅速回到他们上次醒着的时候，那时他们做爱，在昏暗的光线中摸索彼此，亲吻，抚摸着汗湿的皮肤，同时呻吟。这是他们的第一次，做起来仿佛早已熟知其中的机制，而渚薰认为这一切是所有生命存在的起点，为了确保任何物种的生存而进行的繁殖行为，但在他看来，这一切都被所谓的爱所超越。

Love, he thought, and basing it from his experience with the literary and artistic works of humanity, wasn't just the mere act of copulation, mistaken as the carnal definition of love, but it really encompassed everything the lilim valued; love produced peace but also war; some lilim killed or died for love; some made profit from it; and some founded several religions with love as one of the pillars of faith.  
爱，他想，基于他对人类文学和艺术作品的经验，不仅仅是交媾这一被误认为肉体之爱的行为，它真正涵盖了莉莉姆所珍视的一切；爱带来和平也引发战争；有些莉莉姆为爱杀戮或牺牲；有些从中获利；还有些以爱为信仰的支柱创立了多种宗教。

Kaworu sighed, and then smiled.  
渚薰叹了口气，然后微笑了。

Love wasn't about sex or something that should be followed up by marriage; love was paying respect to one's opposite, but also to one's parents, friends, and if one is so compassionate, to all people; love was meant to give meaning to life, a purpose, a reason to exist.  
爱不是关于性或随之而来的婚姻；爱是对对立者的尊重，也是对父母、朋友，以及若心怀慈悲，对所有人的尊重；爱旨在赋予生命意义，一个目的，一个存在的理由。

Briefly he looked down at Rei, still in slumber, and thought of someone else.  
他短暂地低头看向仍在熟睡的丽，心中却想起了另一个人。

Through the thoughts of many whom he made psychic contact and thus accessed their pasts, Kaworu finally formed an overall view of Commander Ikari's personality: clearly he was a man driven to "rescue" his wife back into existence, and at the cost of many, and much had to be sacrificed to achieve his goal piece-by-piece.  
通过与许多人建立心灵联系并借此了解他们的过去，渚薰终于对碇司令的性格有了全面的认识：显然，他是一个为了“拯救”妻子而奋不顾身的男人，为此不惜牺牲众多，为了实现目标，他必须一步步付出巨大的代价。

He wondered what that man was doing at the moment in his ivory tower; perhaps he was plotting, scheming, and finding some cut-throat way to deal with the old men that made up the entity called SEELE; perhaps he brooded at his loss, or maybe he was contemplating about the future.  
他好奇那个男人此刻在他的象牙塔里做些什么；或许他正在策划、密谋，寻找某种狠辣的手段来对付那些组成 SEELE 的老人们；或许他在沉思自己的损失，或者可能在思考未来。

A thought entered Kaworu's mind, and it was quite unpleasant that he sighed and frowned: what if Commander Ikari discovered his true purpose? And should he be caught, what sort of penalty Kaworu may have to deal with?  
一个念头闪过渚薰的脑海，这让他不禁叹息并皱起了眉头：如果碇司令发现了他的真实目的，那么一旦被捕，他将面临怎样的惩罚呢？

As he was an Angel, Kaworu knew that death would be his final disposition, one way or another. He'd been sent here on a one-way trip, having been informed of what he was supposed to do: to subjugate NERV.  
作为使徒，渚薰深知死亡将是他不可避免的结局。他被派来执行一项单程任务，被告知他的使命是征服 NERV。

Except he discovered that not all of these people he encountered within NERV were deserving of condemnation; perhaps with the exception of Commander Ikari, everyone else had a reason to be here, principally for the defense of human existence as a bulwark against the Angels; of course the Evas and their functionality in combat would not be made possible without the help of many hands.  
然而，他发现并非所有在 NERV 中遇到的人都是该受谴责的；或许除了碇司令之外，其他人都有留在这里的理由，主要是为了作为抵御使徒的堡垒，捍卫人类的存在；当然，没有众多人的协助，EVA 及其在战斗中的功能性是不可能实现的。

But still the old men of SEELE wanted their way to be done, to play NERV into their own hands before crushing it completely, and before that Kaworu knew that they were waiting for him at this very moment, huddled behind their holographic monoliths, proclaiming themselves as the invisible, manipulative puppeteers who held the strings to human existence.  
但 SEELE 的老人们仍执意要按他们的方式行事，在彻底摧毁 NERV 之前将其玩弄于股掌之中，而碇真嗣知道，此刻他们正躲在全息巨石后等待着他，自诩为隐形操纵者，掌控着人类命运的提线木偶师。

Very well, he'll give them a nice show.  
很好，他会给他们一场精彩的表演。

Again, Kaworu sighed as he slowly eased himself away from Rei and the bed, his feet touching the tiled floor. Tiptoeing his way across the room, Kaworu found a paper pad and a pen, before he wrote down a brief message for Rei. Satisfied, Kaworu tore off the scribbled note and left it tacked to the refrigerator door, and then quietly picked up his clothes piled on the floor besides the bed.  
碇真嗣再次叹息，缓缓从绫波和床上起身，脚尖触碰着瓷砖地面。他踮着脚穿过房间，找到一张纸和一支笔，写下给绫波的简短留言。满意后，碇真嗣撕下潦草的便条，将其钉在冰箱门上，然后悄悄拾起床边地板上堆放的衣物。

Kaworu dressed, putting on his underwear and then his clothes, tied up his shoes and picked up the backpack containing his communications gear. He then passed by the kitchen and washed and dried his face with a towel.  
カヲルは着替え、下着を着てから洋服を着て、靴を結んで、通信機材を入れたリュックを持ち上げた。それから台所に寄り、タオルで顔を洗い、乾かした。

Just as he was about to step outside, however, Kaworu hesitated, and went back to Rei. There he carefully leaned close enough to kiss her on the forehead, before making a step back and gave the girl one last look before leaving.  
しかし、外に出ようとしたとき、カヲルはためらい、レイのところに戻った。そこで彼は慎重に額にキスをするほど近づき、一歩下がって少女に最後の一瞥を投げかけてから出発した。

For a moment he was uneasy; he wished he could stay longer, perhaps waking up with Rei in the morning with nothing to worry about except to make some breakfast for two and small talk, but he had no choice but to acquiesce himself to duty.  
一瞬、彼は不安だった；もっと長く滞在できたら、レイと朝に目覚めて、二人分の朝食を作り、ちょっとした雑談をする以外に心配することがないかもしれないが、彼には義務に従うしかなかった。

"I'll see you later," Kaworu whispered. "Don't worry about me."  
"待会儿见，" 渚薰低声说道。"别担心我。"

But Rei responded by a mere murmur.  
但绫波只是轻声呢喃作为回应。

The Fifth Children then quietly walked away, went out and closed the door with the near-silent click of the lock. He took a deep breath, gazed at the night sky before him for a while, before adjusting his backpack and walked towards the stairs.  
第五适格者随后静静地走开，出门并轻轻地关上了门，锁舌几乎无声地合上。他深吸了一口气，凝视了一会儿眼前的夜空，然后调整了一下背包，走向楼梯。

Keel Lorenz was a man not known for sleeping early. For the longest time it became a personal habit to be up until two in the morning, his mind swirling with ideas and responsibilities and duties to deal with while plotting and moving his chess pieces across the global board: manipulating politicians and clerics, deciding the policies of the agencies and militaries under SEELE's control, rewarding allies and punishing enemies.  
基尔·洛伦兹并非早睡之人。长期以来，他养成了凌晨两点才就寝的习惯，脑海中充斥着各种想法、责任和义务，同时在全球棋盘上谋划并移动他的棋子：操纵政客和神职人员，决定 SEELE 控制下的机构和军队的政策，奖励盟友并惩罚敌人。

Sitting on an easy chair by the fireplace, he paused to pick up his cup of Earl Grey tea and took a sip. The drink was still warm, pleasant and bittersweet as he wanted, a far cry from the ersatz coffee he had to chug in the last desperate days of World War Two, a Mauser Karabiner 98k on one hand and a tin cup in another, dirtied, worried and angry at Hitler for causing destruction on all Germans.  
他坐在壁炉旁的安乐椅上，停下来拿起他的伯爵红茶啜饮一口。茶水依旧温热，苦中带甜，令人愉悦，与二战末期他不得不猛灌的劣质咖啡相去甚远，那时他一手握着毛瑟 Karabiner 98k 步枪，另一手拿着锡杯，满身尘土，忧心忡忡，对希特勒给所有德国人带来的毁灭感到愤怒。

Keel sighed as he relived that sordid time of his youth, pressed into war, along with his other fellows, soon to be felled by Russian bullets and munitions and flamethrowers amidst the rubble, a very unforgiving lot they were.  
基尔叹息着回忆起那段不堪的青春岁月，被迫参战，与其他同伴一样，不久便在废墟中被俄国的子弹、弹药和火焰喷射器击倒，他们真是无情的一群人。

His father, as Keel knew the story, was a fanatical occultist and an industrialist, and when the elder Lorenz discovered that Hitler was jumping with joy about himself being mentioned by Nostradamus in the prophet's quatrains, he offered his services and finances, hoping somehow that the longstanding dreams of SEELE could be made possible through the Third Reich.  
据基尔所知，他的父亲是一位狂热的神秘主义者和实业家。当老洛伦兹发现希特勒因被诺查丹玛斯在其四行诗中提及而欣喜若狂时，他主动提供服务和资金，希望能让 SEELE 长久以来的梦想通过第三帝国成为可能。

But it was not to be, for the mad dictator devoted his energies micro-managing the army, much to the chagrin of his generals, all the while approving the development and use of conventional weapons, some of which included a massive battle tank and jet fighters. By the time the Russians were closing in on Berlin, in his frustration and anger over the loss and waste, the elder Lorenz went to the toilets in one of the underground bunkers, and blew out his brains with a pistol.  
但事与愿违，这位疯狂的独裁者将精力过多地投入到对军队的微观管理中，这让他的将军们颇为沮丧，同时他还批准了常规武器的开发和使用，其中包括一种巨型坦克和喷气式战斗机。当俄国人逼近柏林时，老洛伦兹因失去和浪费而感到沮丧和愤怒，他在其中一个地下掩体的厕所里用一把手枪结束了自己的生命。

_What a difference it makes_, Keel told himself. He succeeded where his father had failed, rebuilding and consolidating SEELE into what it was today, more powerful and wide-ranging than any empire in history.  
基尔对自己说，这差别可大了。他在父亲失败的地方取得了成功，重建并巩固了 SEELE，使其成为今天比历史上任何帝国都更强大、更广泛的存在。

He wondered if there were any territories left to conquer, with almost everything under control, to be conveniently manipulated for profit or power, as SEELE no longer needed to fire a shot simply to seize every square meter of land and the people who occupied it. Hence, the world was in their hands, and they could do anything with it.  
他思索着是否还有未征服的领地，几乎一切都在掌控之中，可以为了利益或权力方便地操纵。既然 SEELE 不再需要开一枪就能夺取每一平方米土地和占据其上的人们，世界便已落入他们手中，可以随心所欲地摆布。

Like gods.

Except he and his fellows were in their mortal shells, in the twilight of their lives, most of them having gone far enough, tired and not contented, they all knew that there was one way to transcend corporeal existence and attain immortality: Instrumentality.  
只是他和他的同僚们仍困于凡躯，生命已至黄昏，多数人已走得足够远，疲惫而不满足，他们都知道有一种方式能超越肉体存在，获得永生：人类补完计划。

Keel looked upon the grandfather clock standing in the far corner: it past two in the morning. He picked up his phone and dialed for his Russian counterpart, Starayakov, for it was time for them to make contact with their angelic emissary, one which an Arab member of the council referred to Kaworu as _Malak al-Haq,_ or the Angel of Truth.  
基尔抬头望向远处角落里的落地钟：已是凌晨两点。他拿起电话，拨给了他的俄罗斯同僚斯塔拉亚科夫，是时候与他们的天使使者联络了，一位阿拉伯议会成员称其为卡乌洛，即“真理天使”。

_That young man, whether he's allied or against us,_ Keel thought, _one way or another, he knows he's fated to die._  
那个年轻人，无论是敌是友，基尔心想，无论如何，他知道自己注定要死。

Misato wasn't around by the time Shinji and Asuka arrived at their quarters, hair damp and clothes almost moistened by the pool water. While they made the journey back, they whispered sweet nothings and exchanging kisses in the elevator.  
当真嗣和明日香回到他们的房间时，美里已经不在了，他们的头发湿漉漉的，衣服也因为泳池的水而有些湿润。在他们回来的路上，他们在电梯里低声细语，交换着亲吻。

Still feeling cold, Shinji said, "Thought we should have some hot chocolate."  
仍然感到寒冷，真嗣说："我想我们应该喝点热巧克力。"

Asuka nodded as she dried her hair with a towel from the bathroom. "Sure, why not?" she replied happily, before she watched Shinji walk over to the kitchenette, took two packs of instant hot chocolate mix into mugs, and prepared the beverages with hot water and milk.  
明日香一边用浴室里的毛巾擦干头发，一边点头。“当然，为什么不呢？”她开心地回答，然后看着真嗣走向小厨房，拿起两包即溶热巧克力粉倒入马克杯中，用热水和牛奶准备饮品。

"When this is over," Shinji said as he stirred the two cups with a teaspoon, "I'll propose once we graduate from high school."  
“等这一切结束，”真嗣一边用茶匙搅拌着两个杯子，一边说，“我会在高中毕业后向你求婚。”

Asuka blinked. "You mean getting married?"  
明日香眨了眨眼。“你是说结婚？”

"Yeah, but for now we're still too young for that, and we're not yet done with this…" Shinji paused to sigh, and added, "This Angel business."  
“是啊，但现在我们还太年轻，而且这件事还没完……” 真嗣停顿了一下，叹了口气，补充道，“这些使徒的事。”

"I'm not anxious either," Asuka agreed as Shinji walked over to her and gave one of the filled mugs. "Thanks," she said.  
“我也不着急，”明日香同意道，真嗣走过来递给她一杯装满的啤酒。“谢谢，”她说。

Shinji nodded. "There's something else… I was wondering what the future would be for Ayanami and Nagisa."  
真嗣点点头。“还有别的事……我在想，绫波和渚的未来会是什么样。”

Asuka took a sip. "Just like us, I suppose."  
明日香抿了一口。“大概和我们一样吧。”

"Yeah, but from the looks of it, I think they're still learning," Shinji said as he sat down besides his girlfriend, and carefully drank a little so as not to allow his tongue to be scalded.  
“是啊，但看样子，我觉得他们还在学习，”真嗣说着坐在了女朋友旁边，小心翼翼地喝了一小口，以免舌头被烫到。

The redhead sighed in pleasure and said, "You know what? We've just crossed the threshold and, just look at the way you talk today… You're a different person now."  
红发女孩满足地叹了口气，说道：“你知道吗？我们刚刚跨过门槛，看看你今天说话的方式……你现在完全变了个人。”

Shinji blinked, completely flattered. "Me?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，完全受宠若惊。"我？"

"Yeah," Asuka said. "Like as if you grown up in a space of six days."  
"是啊，"明日香说。"就像你在六天之内长大了一样。"

The young man chuckled. "You're no different either; you have changed too."  
年轻人轻笑道："你也没什么不同；你也变了。"

For a moment the couple said nothing else as they drank up the hot cocoa, thinking of the sex they had down at the poolside, self-discovery in the most intimate way, even though they knew the risks. Both had the imagery of their passionate throes burned into their memories for the rest of their lives, to be cherished, and if needed be, reenact it.  
有那么一会儿，这对情侣没有再说什么，只是喝着热可可，回想着他们在泳池边的那场欢爱，以最亲密的方式自我发现，尽管他们知道其中的风险。两人都将那份激情澎湃的画面深深刻在记忆中，留待余生珍藏，必要时还可重温。

"I just want to ask something else," Asuka said, breaking the silence.  
“我只是想问点别的，”明日香打破了沉默。

"What?" Shinji wondered.

"In our future, where will your father be figuring in? I mean, where he'll fit?"  
“在我们的未来，你父亲会扮演什么角色？我是说，他会适合哪里？”

The young man shook his head. "I just don't know, because he's a complicated man, and because..."  
年轻人摇了摇头。“我就是不知道，因为他是个复杂的人，而且因为……”

"He has your mama in the head?"  
“他让你妈头疼吗？”

"Yeah," Shinji answered, before sighing. "I'll never know if he'll change; he's too stubborn, beyond my reach... But you and Misato, and Ayanami and Nagisa are the only family I can rely on."  
“是啊，”真嗣回答，随即叹了口气。“我永远不知道他是否会改变；他太固执，我无法触及……但你和美里，还有绫波和渚，是我唯一能依靠的家人。”

"Uh, speaking of Rei and Kaworu," Asuka said, "Any idea what else they're doing right now?"  
"呃，说到丽和薰，" 明日香说道，"你知道他们现在还在做什么吗？"

Shinji smiled wryly. "Maybe they're now doing the same thing as we have done, I suppose."  
真嗣苦笑了一下。"也许他们现在正在做和我们一样的事情，我想。"

---

Once again, just like a few nights before, Kaworu levitated his way across the lagoon, his feet not touching the surface of the calm waters, until he reached the rocky outcropping in the middle. He then took out and set up his communication equipment, donned the holographic glasses, before pressing a button on the phone to lock onto one of the orbiting SEELE-controlled communication satellites flying over Hakone until he got a clear signal. He pressed another button to transmit, the signal from the antenna fired up to more than 200 kilometers above the Earth.  
又一次，就像几天前的夜晚一样，薰悬浮着穿过泻湖，他的脚没有触及平静的水面，直到他到达中间的岩石露头。然后他拿出并架设好通讯设备，戴上全息眼镜，然后按下电话上的一个按钮锁定到飞越箱根的一个 SEELE 控制的通讯卫星，直到他获得清晰的信号。他按下另一个按钮进行传输，信号从天线发射到地球上方 200 多公里的地方。

The satellite then processed the signal, encrypted before retransmitting it through a downlink to Siberia, where an array of parabolic antennas obtained the link and rerouted it to the conference room where Keel and company awaited.  
卫星随后处理了信号，加密后通过下行链路重新传输到西伯利亚，那里的一系列抛物面天线接收了链接并将其重新路由到基尔及其团队等待的会议室。

Before Keel was a long conference table, and seated around it was the rest of the council, with each of them a pair of holographic glasses placed before them. They looked eager, even in this early morning, anxious for any news from their ambassador.  
基尔面前是一张长长的会议桌，桌旁坐着委员会的其他成员，每人面前都摆放着一副全息眼镜。他们看起来很急切，即使在这清晨时分，也焦急地等待着来自他们大使的任何消息。

"Let us begin, gentlemen," Keel said as they donned their glasses and signaled to an aide to acknowledge the linkup.  
“先生们，让我们开始吧，”基尔说着戴上眼镜，示意助手确认连接。

At around the same time, Makoto and Misato were looking at Kaworu through high-powered Nikon binoculars with the night-vision option installed. With the Renault Alpine parked behind them, they were stationed at a parking lot on the circumferential highway on the hills above what was left of Tokyo-3. By the readout of their rangefinders installed in the binoculars they were six kilometers away from Kaworu, unaware that he was being watched as he stood on a rocky outcropping.  
大约在同一时间，真琴和美里正通过装有夜视功能的尼康高倍望远镜观察着渚。他们身后停着一辆雷诺 Alpine，驻扎在环绕山丘的高速公路上的一个停车场，俯瞰着残存的第三新东京市。根据望远镜内置测距仪的读数，他们距离渚有六公里远，而渚站在一块岩石突出部上，并未察觉自己正被监视。

"There," Makoto said as he held his binoculars. "I can see him now. What he's doing?"  
“那里，”真琴举着望远镜说道，“我现在能看到他了。他在做什么？”

"I think that's his electronic gear," Misato replied. "He's going to call his superiors. Talk about 'ET, phone home'."  
“我想那是他的电子设备，”美里回答，“他要联系他的上级了。真是‘ET，打电话回家’啊。”

"Yeah, with those glasses he's wearing, they must be holographic specs, as they're useful for immersive interaction such as teleconferencing."  
“是啊，他戴的那副眼镜，肯定是全息镜片，适合用于远程会议这类沉浸式互动。”

"I see," Misato said. "Wonder what they'll be talking about… Shit, I should've borrowed some surveillance gear from Tsutomo, so that we could even eavesdrop on him."  
“我明白了，”美里说，“不知道他们会谈些什么……该死，我应该向津友借些监听设备的，这样我们就能偷听他了。”

"Wait, wait…" Makoto said. "Just look because something's up."  
“等等，等等……”真琴说，“只是看看，因为有些不对劲。”

"Okay."

One by one, each of the black monoliths appeared as they encircled him. They towered, hovering above the early morning waters.  
一个接一个，黑色的巨石碑环绕着他显现。它们高耸着，悬浮在清晨的水面上。

"Good morning," SEELE 01 simply greeted.  
"早上好，" SEELE 01 简单地问候道。

"Good morning, gentlemen," Kaworu answered at the cabal, bowing slightly with his head.  
"早上好，各位先生，" 渚薰向秘密组织回应道，微微点头致意。

Behind his digital slab, Keel mumbled in approval. "We are very pleased to see you again," he began. "Now before we start, let me quote Ivan Karamazov: 'I want to be there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for.'"  
在他那块数字平板后，基尔低声表示赞同。“我们非常高兴再次见到你，”他开口道，“现在开始之前，让我引用伊万·卡拉马佐夫的话：‘我想在场，当每个人突然明白这一切都是为了什么。’”

"And we have now realized Karamazov's ambition," SEELE 04 intoned. "We know what it is all about."  
“而现在，我们实现了卡拉马佐夫的雄心，”SEELE 04 庄严地说道，“我们知道这一切的意义所在。”

"Aye," the other monoliths agreed in unison.  
“是的，”其他巨石一致同意道。

Kaworu nodded. "Can I speak on my behalf?" he asked politely.  
渚薰点头。“我可以为自己说话吗？”他礼貌地问道。

"Yes, you may do so," SEELE 01 answered.  
“是的，你可以这样做，”Seele 01 回答道。

"From the way I have seen," Kaworu remarked, "humans are unable to create something out of nothing... They must have something to start with, because humans aren't gods. They're mere mortals."  
“从我所见，”渚薰评论道，“人类无法无中生有……他们必须有所凭借，因为人类不是神。他们只是凡人。”

"Yes, there were such ambitious fools who tried to be gods," SEELE 01 answered. "But there is a man who seeks to gain power equal to God... the one reason why Evas exist for that purpose."  
"是的，有些野心勃勃的傻瓜试图成为神，" SEELE 01 回答道。"但有一个人追求着与神同等的力量……这就是 Eva 存在的唯一理由。"

"There is a man besides us who wants to reopen Pandora's Box," SEELE 05 added.  
"除了我们之外，还有一个人想要重新打开潘多拉的盒子，" SEELE 05 补充道。"

"And who wants to close the Box before hope can appear?" SEELE 02 opined.  
"而谁又想在希望出现之前关闭这个盒子呢？" SEELE 02 提出疑问。"

Kaworu's eyes narrowed. "Hope?" he asked. "Yes, Lilim always seek hope for something... when there's desperation."  
渚薰的眼睛眯了起来。“希望？”他问道。“是的，人类总是在绝望中寻求希望。”

"There are as many forms of hope as there are people," SEELE 01 said. "Hope exists only in the hearts of people. However, in our case our hopes are materializing in our favor."  
“希望的形式因人而异，”SEELE 01 说道。“希望只存在于人们的心中。然而，在我们的情况下，我们的希望正朝着有利于我们的方向实现。”

"In Lilith, the progenitor of humanity is the false successors from the Black Moon." SEELE 06 seconded.  
“在莉莉丝身上，人类的始祖是来自黑月的不实继承者。”SEELE 06 附和道。

"And in Adam, the progenitor of Angels are the true successors from the lost White Moon," SEELE 07 added.  
“而在亚当，这位天使的始祖中，才是失落白月的真正继承者，”SEELE 07 补充道。

"And whose salvaged soul resides only within you," SEELE 10 emphasized.  
“而谁的救赎之魂只寄居于你体内，”SEELE 10 强调道。

Kaworu nodded. "Yes, of course."  
渚薰点头。“是的，当然。”

"But there is one thing you should know... Adam's revived body is already inside Ikari," SEELE 01 said. "This blasphemer will be our undoing if his plans succeed, and thus we should not allow it to impede our chances."  
"但有一件事你必须知道...亚当的复活体已经进入了碇，" SEELE 01 说道。"如果这个亵渎者的计划成功，他将毁掉我们，因此我们不能让这种情况阻碍我们的机会。"

"I know that he has possession of Adam. Do you wish for me to stop him?" Kaworu asked.  
"我知道他拥有亚当。你是想让我阻止他吗？" 渚薰问道。"

For a moment the cabal didn't said a word until SEELE 01 cleared his throat. "That is not an option, as we are sure that traitor shall fail in his quest. Instead, you are supposed to continue the masquerade as planned until you sacrifice yourself."  
片刻间，这个阴谋集团没有说一句话，直到 SEELE 01 清了清喉咙。"这不是一个选项，因为我们确信那个叛徒会在他的任务中失败。相反，你应该按照计划继续伪装，直到你牺牲自己。"

Now it was Kaworu's turn to keep silence as he let Keel talk.  
现在轮到渚薰保持沉默，任由基路说话。

"You have been born and raised from the remains of Adam, using my DNA as the basis for your physical structure," SEELE 01 said. "We trained you, shaped your mind to be as wise and knowledgeable as we wanted, but you managed to exceed our expectations, as you were destined to fulfill your sacred vow."  
“你诞生并成长于亚当的残骸之中，以我的 DNA 为基础构建了你的身体，”Seele 01 说道，“我们训练你，塑造你的心智，使之如我们所愿般智慧与博学，但你却超越了我们的期望，注定要完成你神圣的誓言。”

Suddenly Kaworu wondered if Keel knew of his activities when they were not looking at him, as he detected suspicion in that elder's voice.  
突然间，渚薰怀疑基路是否知晓他在他们不注意时的所作所为，因为他从那位长者的声音中察觉到了怀疑。

"We are everywhere, and hiding is futile," the old man behind the monolith said.  
“我们无处不在，隐藏是徒劳的，”石碑后的老人说道。

"Have I done something wrong?" Kaworu wondered.  
“我做错了什么吗？”渚薰疑惑道。

If the monoliths were capable of movement, SEELE 01 would've leaned forward, close enough that Kaworu's face could fit into the digit on the black digital slate. Instead Kaworu heard a rumbling of the throat issuing from it, and then the old man spoke.  
如果石碑能移动，Seele 01 会前倾，近到渚薰的脸能嵌入黑色数字石板上的数字里。然而，渚薰听到的是从石碑中传来的喉咙咕噜声，随后老人开口了。

"You are supposed to do as planned," SEELE 01 said. "You were to supply us with intelligence, to know their movements and policies; you were supposed to emasculate this Ikari boy, to remove his resolve until he loses the will to fight with his Eva. Above all, you were supposed to provoke confusion and uncertainty within NERV once you show them that you are an Angel."  
"你应该按照计划行事，" SEELE 01 说道。"你的任务是向我们提供情报，了解他们的动向和政策；你应该削弱这个碇姓少年的决心，直到他失去驾驶 Eva 的意志。最重要的是，你应该在 NERV 内部制造混乱和不确定，让他们意识到你是一个使徒。"

This time it sounded more of a downright accusation, as Kaworu thought in alarm, _What is going on?_  
这一次听起来更像是一种直接的指控，这让渚薰惊慌地想，到底发生了什么？

"You were meant to be our only hope to bring the fruition of our long-standing dreams, and yet… Yet, you chose an entirely different path from ours!" SEELE 01 growled.  
"你本应是我们实现长久以来梦想的唯一希望，然而……然而，你却选择了与我们完全不同的道路！" SEELE 01 咆哮道。"

Kaworu was taken aback by the unexpected rebuke, as it was now clear they were angry, and thus his eyes narrowed and said, "I have made my choice."  
渚薰被这突如其来的斥责惊到了，显然对方已经生气了，于是他的眼神变得锐利，说道：“我已经做出了选择。”

"What choice?" SEELE 01 demanded.  
“什么选择？”SEELE 01 质问道。

"I have chosen to live, rather than die for a fool's dream," Kaworu replied, defiance in his beating heart as he thought he could hear the old man's labored breathing, an indication that Keel was furious. "That is the truth," he added.  
“我选择活下去，而不是为一个愚蠢的梦想而死，”渚薰回答，他心中充满了反抗，仿佛能听到老人的沉重呼吸，这表明基尔已经愤怒至极。“这就是真相，”他补充道。

"Traitor," SEELE 01 spat out the word. "How hard-headed you are, young man. I am disappointed to hear from one of our sources that you have a little affair with the First Children."  
"叛徒，" SEELE 01 吐出这个词。"你真是顽固不化，年轻人。我感到失望，从我们的一个消息来源得知，你与第一子嗣有染。"

"How much do you know?" Kaworu answered. "In the days since I arrived here I have discovered many things that I have never experienced before: friendship, trust, happiness, individuality, compassion, and the one thing that opened my eyes the most, and what the lilim sought for, is _LOVE!_"  
"你知道多少？" 渚薰回答。"自从我来到这里，我发现了许多以前从未体验过的事情：友谊、信任、幸福、个性、同情，以及最让我大开眼界，也是人类所追求的东西，那就是爱！"

At first, SEELE 01 said nothing, as he let Kaworu's words sink in, before he gave out a spiteful chuckle. "One way or another, you shall die gloriously," the old man said. "We know that you are now heavily involved with the First Children, whom we sought to obtain an audience from her and yet Ikari denied us the chance. Instead of doing as we ordered, you fell for this young woman because of this thing called love. We pity you for such a foolish and naïve course of action, which shall be of your undoing."  
起初，SEELE 01 一言不发，让渚薰的话沉淀下来，然后发出了一声嘲讽的轻笑。"无论如何，你都将光荣地死去，"老人说。"我们知道你现在与第一子嗣关系密切，我们本想与她会面，但碇却拒绝了我们。你没有按照我们的命令行事，而是因为所谓的爱而爱上了这个年轻女子。我们为你如此愚蠢和天真的行为感到惋惜，这将导致你的失败。"

"I don't care," Kaworu said. "If I die and they know the truth about you and your plans, NERV, and perhaps the rest of the world, may oppose you to the death."  
"我不在乎，" 渚薰说。"如果我死了，他们知道了你的真相和你的计划，NERV，甚至可能全世界，都会与你至死方休。"

"Kaji is dead, and there's nothing else they could do about it," SEELE 01 answered, mentioning the spy slain by their executive agent. "Nothing will be gained from making a dead man talk."  
"加持已经死了，他们对此无能为力，" SEELE 01 回答道，提到了被他们的执行特工所杀的间谍。"让一个死人开口说话毫无意义。"

"They did."

"How?" SEELE 01 demanded. "Whatever they'll do, NERV will soon be destroyed in the process, and we will emerge triumphant."  
"怎么做？" SEELE 01 质问道。"无论他们做什么，NERV 很快就会在过程中被摧毁，而我们将会取得胜利。"

"They have the truth," Kaworu said. "I have seen it, and I'm sure they'll use this information to bring you down, even if I die as you wanted. But should I survive, I'll join the fight because I'll defend for the things I believe and value the most."  
"他们掌握了真相，" 渚薰说道。"我亲眼所见，我确信他们会利用这些信息来扳倒你，即便如你所愿我死去。但若我能幸存，我将加入战斗，因为我将捍卫我最信仰和珍视的东西。"

"Is it not, Mister Nagisa, that you quoted Nietzsche about idealism as a falsehood?" SEELE 01 countered, recalling their earlier conversation in the garden shortly before Kaworu's departure.  
"难道不是吗，渚先生，你曾引用尼采关于理想主义是虚假的观点？" SEELE 01 反驳道，回想起他们不久前在花园里关于渚薰离开前的对话。

"That's right," Kaworu confirmed, fighting not to lose his composure.  
"没错，" 渚薰确认道，努力不让自己失去冷静。

"Love is a form of idealism," SEELE 01 said. "Love does not feed mouths or guarantee security for anyone; it does nothing except to confuse logic and reason, making fools even out of learned men and women who fall for it. It does not work here, and therefore not of use in our plans, because by the time Instrumentality is fulfilled, there shall be no human conflict and emotions to worry about as soon as we reach singularity. There will be eternal peace, there will be no pain or suffering, and above all, there will be no sin, as we become one with God."  
"爱是一种理想主义的形式，" SEELE 01 说道。"爱不能填饱肚子，也不能保证任何人的安全；它除了混淆逻辑和理性，让那些陷入爱河的学者男女变成傻瓜之外，什么也做不了。在这里它不起作用，因此在我们计划中毫无用处，因为当实现人类补完计划时，一旦我们达到奇点，将不再有人类冲突和情感需要担忧。将会有永恒的和平，没有痛苦或苦难，最重要的是，没有罪恶，因为我们与神合一。"

Kaworu kept his silence, letting Keel vent his fury in carefully-measured words.  
渚薰保持沉默，让基尔在精心斟酌的言辞中发泄他的愤怒。

"Even if you have made the choice to fight us, such a decision will be irrelevant once we send the Eva Series. You will die along with them, and there's nothing you can do about it for the clock is ticking away. Of course, by this time I am sure that Commander Ikari has also placed you under suspicion, for he will stop at nothing in making his wish come true."  
"即使你选择与我们对抗，一旦我们派出 EVA 系列，这样的决定也将变得无关紧要。你将与他们一同死去，对此你无能为力，因为时钟正在滴答作响。当然，到这个时候，我确信碇司令也已经对你产生了怀疑，因为他会不择手段地实现他的愿望。"

"Is it not because he loved his wife so much?" Kaworu questioned.  
"难道不是因为他深爱着他的妻子吗？" 渚薰问道。

"Yui Ikari… No," Keel corrected himself. "Yui Saint-Clair. What a woman she was, opposing our plans, falsely believing that Eva will be a symbol of human existence. Why not Gendo Rokobungi should marry her? Because she was then connected to us, and he thought by identifying himself with SEELE will make him feel secure and powerful. Such idealistic fools, yet thanks to their contributions of knowledge they managed to accelerate the development of our plans."  
"碇唯…不，" 基尔纠正自己。"圣克莱尔·碇唯。她是个怎样的女人啊，反对我们的计划，错误地相信 Eva 将成为人类存在的象征。为什么不是碇源堂娶她？因为她那时与我们有关联，他认为通过与 SEELE 结盟会让他感到安全和强大。这些理想主义的傻瓜，尽管如此，由于他们的知识贡献，他们成功地加速了我们的计划发展。

"I see," Kaworu whispered.  
"我明白了，" 渚薰低声说。

"Before we leave," Keel said. "Now that you have chosen your fate, are you prepared?"  
“在我们离开之前，”基尔说，“既然你已经选择了自己的命运，你准备好了吗？”

Kaworu took a breath, and said, "I am not afraid anymore, whether I live or die. Whatever happens to me, they will not underestimate you. As for the days I spent here, I changed their lives as much as they changed mine, and my friends are deserving of compassion. That's something I'll treasure even if I find myself in the jaws of death."  
渚深吸了一口气，说道：“我不再害怕了，无论是生是死。无论我遭遇什么，他们都不会再小看你。至于我在这里度过的日子，我改变了他们的生活，就像他们改变了我的一样，我的朋友们值得同情。即使我陷入死亡的深渊，这也是我会珍惜的东西。”

Keel snorted. "You are now useless to us, no matter whatever you say," he said. "You betrayed us and our goals. Henceforth, you shall be erased as predicted."  
基尔嗤之以鼻。“无论你说什么，你现在对我们已经毫无用处，”他说，“你背叛了我们和我们的目标。从今以后，你将如预言般被抹去。”

With those parting words, the monoliths vanished into the air, leaving Kaworu alone. He took off the glasses, then slowly sat down on the outcropping as the cold breeze blew around him and began to ponder on the words he made.  
随着这些离别的话语，那些巨石消失在空气中，留下独自一人的渚薰。他摘下眼镜，然后缓缓坐在突出的岩石上，任由冷风环绕着他，开始沉思起自己所说的话。

Kaworu sighed and then said, "Everything's going according to Ikari's plan."  
渚薰叹了口气，然后说道：“一切都在碇的计划之中。”

---

"Looks like things have gotten pretty ugly for him," Makoto said, having noticed the disappointed expression on Kaworu's face.  
“看来他的情况变得相当糟糕，”真嗣说道，注意到渚薰脸上失望的表情。

"I can see that," Misato said. "I have a feeling that they must've known the truth, and so they scolded him... No, this is more serious, I think, because Kaworu was supposed to work for these guys, and then they discovered that he double-crossed them."  
"我看得出来，"美里说。"我感觉他们肯定知道真相，所以责备了他...不，我觉得这更严重，因为卡洛是应该为这些人工作的，结果他们发现他背叛了他们。"

"The mole must've snitched on him," Makoto said.  
"那个内奸肯定告发了他，"真琴说。"

"It could be…" "可能是…"

Without warning, Kaworu turned to face at their direction, and his crimson eyes stared back at them. The surprising move nearly caused the duo to drop the binoculars they were holding onto.  
毫无预警地，渚薰转向他们的方向，那双深红色的眼睛直视着他们。这一突如其来的举动差点让两人手中的望远镜滑落。

"What the hell?" Misato wondered aloud. "How did he know we're here?"  
“搞什么鬼？”美里不禁脱口而出，“他是怎么知道我们在这里的？”

"I have no idea," Makoto answered. "I mean, look, he managed to sense our presence even this far."  
“我也不清楚，”真琴回答，“我是说，你看，他居然能在这么远的距离察觉到我们的存在。”

"Let me check again," Misato said as she swung up the binoculars to see Kaworu again, before she felt the phone vibrate in her pocket. She pulled it out and flipped open to receive the call, without checking the caller ID first.  
"让我再确认一下，" 美里说着将望远镜举起，再次望向渚薰，随后她感觉到口袋里的手机震动。她掏出手机，翻开接听，没有先查看来电显示。

"This is Katsuragi," she responded, trying not to sound flabbergasted. "Who is this?"  
"我是葛城，" 她回应道，尽量不显得过于惊讶。"哪位？

"It's Nagisa, and you saw me," Kaworu replied.  
"我是渚，你刚才看到我了，" 薰回答道。

Misato peered closer to see that the Fifth Children now had a mobile phone to his ear. "Y… Yeah," she said.  
美里凑近了些，发现第五适格者现在正拿着手机贴在耳边。“是……是的，”她说。

He looked upset. "Why are you watching over me?"  
他看起来很沮丧。“为什么你要监视我？”

"Because, damn it, we thought you were talking to somebody, and we're very concerned about you!" Misato said. "That's what brought us to see you right down there, and precisely what the hell you were talking about, and with whom?"  
“因为，该死的，我们还以为你在跟某人通话，我们非常担心你！”美里说道，“正是这个原因让我们下来看你，你到底在说什么，跟谁说？”

"Somebody blew my cover," Kaworu answered. "Now that I'm finally done with them, from now on I know what's going to happen to me."  
"有人揭穿了我的伪装，" 渚薰回答道，"现在我终于摆脱了他们，从今往后我知道自己将会遭遇什么。"

"What do you mean, 'them'? I don't understand!"  
"你说的'他们'是什么意思？我不明白！"

"The Committee has effectively disowned me because I neglected to act on their orders. Therefore I'm sure I'll be dead before lunchtime, so I'm expendable."  
"委员会已经实质上抛弃了我，因为我没有按照他们的命令行事。因此我确信自己会在午饭前死去，所以我是可以被牺牲的。"

For a moment Misato had a pang of concern for Kaworu, and thus she said, "Hang on right there, don't leave! We'll try to pick you and Rei up and move you two to a safe place until the heat is off."  
有那么一刻，美里对渚产生了担忧，于是她说道：“在那儿别动，别离开！我们会设法接你和绫波，把你们转移到安全的地方，直到风头过去。”

"No!" Kaworu said, opposing her offer. "I'll deal with it on my own. I'll take a stand."  
“不！”渚反对她的提议，“我会自己处理。我要站出来。”

Misato was aghast. "But… Your request has been denied! You must come with us!"  
美里惊愕不已。“但是……你的请求已被拒绝！你必须跟我们走！”

"This is my responsibility, Misato!" the Fifth Children countered. "I don't want you and our friends to get hurt and be implicated into this mess. Whatever happens to me, I must confront it, and I've got to protect Rei." Kaworu then shut off the phone, gathered and hastily shoved his communication equipment into his backpack and picked it up, before he levitated away, heading to the shore.  
"这是我的责任，美里！" 第五适格者反驳道，"我不想让你和我们的朋友们受伤，也不想让你们卷入这场混乱。无论我遭遇什么，我都必须面对，我必须保护丽。" 说完，铃原便挂断电话，迅速将通讯设备塞进背包，提起背包，随即腾空而起，朝着海岸飞去。

Misato groaned in fury, and she turned to Makoto.  
美里愤怒地呻吟了一声，转向真希波。

"C'mon, we'll have to get Kaworu and Rei out of there!" she loudly commanded as her binoculars dangled violently around her chest.  
"快，我们得把铃原和丽救出来！" 她大声命令道，手中的望远镜在她胸前剧烈摇晃。

"Damn right!" Makoto replied.  
“当然没错！”真琴回答道。

Just then she heard a pair of helicopters roaring over their heads. _God, they're coming for them!_ Misato cried in her thoughts.  
就在这时，她听到两架直升机在头顶轰鸣而过。天哪，他们来抓他们了！美里在心里惊呼。

They yanked the door open, jumped onto the seats, slammed the doors and Misato fired up the car. Without missing a beat they strapped on their seatbelts and the woman officer mashed on the gas pedal, the tires screaming and burning rubber as they left the parking lot at more than 120 kilometers per hour.  
他们猛地拉开车门，跳上座位，砰地关上车门，美里立刻启动了汽车。毫不迟疑地系好安全带，女警官一脚踩下油门，轮胎尖叫着，橡胶燃烧着，以超过每小时 120 公里的速度冲出了停车场。

---

Kaworu was now running at full sprint, across the field of junk and concrete slabs, desperately heading back to Rei's home. He climbed up the stairs, his feet pounding the floor until he reached the door. He then entered and came up to Rei, who was then already awake and startled by his unexpected return.  
渚薰此刻正全力冲刺，穿过废墟与混凝土板构成的荒野，拼命赶回绫波的家。他爬上楼梯，脚步重重地敲击着地面，直到抵达门口。随后他推门而入，来到绫波面前，她已经醒来，被他的突然归来吓了一跳。

"Where did you come from? What did you do?" Rei asked in an alarmed voice, sitting upright and her body covered with a blanket, seeing Kaworu panting in shallow breaths.  
“你从哪儿回来的？做了什么？”绫波惊慌地问道，坐直身子，身上裹着毯子，看着渚薰喘着粗气。

Kaworu stared back at Rei. She was genuinely frightened.  
渚薰凝视着绫波。她是真的害怕了。

"We have to—" he said, but was cut off when the veranda doors were loudly smashed open, shocking both Children to see a pair of black-fatigue-wearing soldiers right before them as they disengaged from their rappelling ropes. One of the soldiers, with the words NERV SRT emblazoned on his vest, unholstered what looked like a pistol and fired a round into Kaworu's chest.  
"我们必须——" 他说道，但话音未落，阳台门便被猛地撞开，两名身着黑色迷彩服的士兵出现在他们面前，正从绳索上降下，惊得两位少年一跳。其中一名士兵胸前印有 NERV SRT 字样，他拔出一把看似手枪的武器，向碇真嗣的胸口开了一枪。

In a second and caught unawares, Kaworu saw a dart embedded right above his heart, and quickly he felt dizzy, not realizing that they hit him with a tranquilizer dart, and he collapsed in a heap on the floor. Astonished, frightened and completely disoriented, Rei then turned around to see the steel door slammed open, and several more soldiers filed in and pointed their submachine guns at her, as though she was a felon caught in the act.  
猝不及防之下，碇真嗣看到一枚飞镖正中他心脏上方，随即感到一阵眩晕，未曾意识到那是麻醉镖，便瘫倒在地。惊愕、恐惧且完全不知所措的绫波零转过身，只见钢制门被猛然撞开，更多的士兵涌入，用冲锋枪对准她，仿佛她是个当场被抓的罪犯。

"What do you want?" Rei demanded in a higher voice, her composure now completely broken, before she saw Commander Ikari walking in with a purposeful stride, and came close to stand before her bed. He then gave the girl a face of ice-cold fury.  
"你们想要什么？" 绫波零提高声音质问，此刻她的镇定已荡然无存，随后她看到碇司令迈着坚定的步伐走进来，靠近她的床边站定。他面带冰冷至极的怒意，俯视着她。

"You're coming with me," Gendo spoke. "It's for your own good."  
"你跟我来，" 源渡说道。"这是为你好。"

Rei looked defiant. "No," she replied. "What wrong he did to y—"  
绫波零显得倔强。"不，"她回答。"他对你做了什么——"

Gendo slapped Rei across the face with the back of his gloved right hand, nearly slamming the girl back onto the bed, before two of the commandoes grabbed and held her by the shoulders. Gendo then leaned forward and close to her face and said, "Your time with the Seventeenth Angel is over."  
源渡用戴着手套的右手背猛地扇了绫波零一巴掌，几乎将她打倒在床上，随后两名突击队员抓住她的肩膀将她固定住。源渡随即俯身贴近她的脸，说道："你与第十七使徒的缘分到此为止了。"

He then nodded to one of the soldiers, who produced an autoinjector syringe full of tranquilizer and stabbed it into Rei's shoulder. Like Kaworu, her eyes slowly rolled upwards, and then as she blacked out, the rest of her body slumped forward, still held up by the troopers.  
随后，他向其中一名士兵点头示意，那士兵随即拿出一个装满镇静剂的自动注射器，猛地扎进绫波的肩膀。与渚一样，她的眼睛缓缓向上翻转，接着在她昏迷之际，身体向前瘫倒，仍被士兵们支撑着。

Now Gendo gazed back at the soldiers around him. "Take them away," he ordered.  
此刻，碇源堂回头看向周围的士兵。“把他们带走。”他命令道。

---

It was too late by the time Misato and Makoto came close to Rei's apartment, as she parked the car behind a pile of rubble and, more than a hundred meters away, they saw a bunch of Suburban and Pajero SUVs clustered near the building, along with the pair of helicopters hovering overhead, their search lights blazing on.  
当美里和真琴接近绫波的公寓时，已经为时已晚。她将车停在了一堆废墟后面，而在百米开外，他们看到一群雪佛兰郊区和帕杰罗 SUV 聚集在大楼附近，两架直升机在空中盘旋，探照灯强烈地照射着。

Picking up their binoculars once more to look closely, they saw Kaworu being carried away in a stretcher, his body tightly bound by belts and hefted by a pair of Second Section SRT commandoes, before they pushed in the stretcher into a van and shut the doors. They then saw poor Rei also on a stretcher, completely blindfolded and dressed only in her oversized polo shirt and underwear, with Commander Ikari following her to a waiting second van, wearing a stony expression on his face.  
再次拿起望远镜仔细观察，他们看到卡罗尔被担架抬走，身体被安全带紧紧束缚，由两名第二分部 SRT 突击队员抬着，随后他们将担架推入一辆货车并关上门。接着，他们看到可怜的丽也在担架上，完全被蒙住眼睛，只穿着她那件过大的马球衫和内衣，碇司令紧随其后走向另一辆等候的货车，脸上带着冷峻的表情。

"Shit," she cursed through her clenched teeth, gritting in total frustration.  
“该死，”她咬牙切齿地咒骂，完全陷入了沮丧之中。

"Do you want to call up the Professor?" Makoto asked, using Fuyutsuki's former professional title.  
“你想联系教授吗？”真琴问道，使用了以前对冬月副司令的尊称。

"Warn him," Misato replied. "Hell, tell the rest of anyone involved, because they could be compromised!"  
"警告他，"美里回答。"见鬼，告诉其他所有相关人员，因为他们可能已经被渗透了！"

Makoto nodded, pulling out his phone and began dialing. As he waited for Fuyutsuki to pick up the phone, he overheard Misato swearing repeatedly in a low voice, blaming herself for not acting quickly.  
真点点头，掏出手机开始拨号。等待冬月接电话时，他无意中听到美里低声咒骂，反复责怪自己没有迅速行动。

---

In his office, Fuyutsuki was sleeping, snoring loudly behind his desk when he heard the phone trilling. Rubbing his eyes, he slowly picked up the phone and lazily said, "Who is this?"  
在自己的办公室里，冬月正在打盹，鼾声如雷地伏在桌后，突然听到电话铃声。他揉了揉眼睛，慢慢拿起电话，懒洋洋地问："哪位？"

"It's me, sir," Makoto replied. "It's urgent."  
"是我，先生，" 真琴回答道，"情况紧急。"

"What the hell is going on, Lieutenant?" Fuyutsuki blurted.  
"到底发生了什么事，中尉？" 冬月脱口而出。"

"Right now Commander Ikari has just captured Ayanami and Nagisa," Makoto rapidly warned. "Worse, we think you and the rest could be in danger now!"  
"现在，碇司令刚刚抓走了绫波和渚，" 真琴迅速警告道，"更糟糕的是，我们认为您和其他人现在可能也处于危险之中！"

Shocked, Fuyutsuki bolted from his chair and replied, "Where are you?"  
震惊之下，冬月猛地从椅子上跳起来，回答道：“你在哪里？”

"I'm with Katsuragi, sir!" Makoto informed. "We were too late to rescue them at her apartment, so I think you still have time to get out of there fast!"  
“我在和葛城小姐在一起，长官！”真希波报告说，“我们赶到她的公寓时已经太迟了，所以我想你还有时间赶紧离开那里！”

But already the old man was up on his feet, having put down the receiver, and just as he was done wearing his shoes, the door slid open and four agents appeared before him, all wearing fatigues and bullet-proof vests. Worse, they also had their pistols trained upon him.  
但老人已经站起身来，放下了听筒，正穿好鞋子时，门滑开了，四个特工出现在他面前，都穿着迷彩服和防弹背心。更糟糕的是，他们的手枪已经对准了他。

"What is the meaning of this?" Fuyutsuki demanded of the men present.  
“这是什么意思？”冬月对在场的人质问道。

"Sir, you're under arrest," one of the agents said. "We're acting on Commander Ikari's orders."  
“先生，您被捕了，”一名特工说，“我们是奉碇司令的命令行事。”

This time Fuyutsuki was outraged. "For what crime? I have done nothing wrong!"  
这一次，冬月愤怒了。“因为什么罪名？我什么错事都没做！”

"For treason, sedition and conspiracy to depose the Commander by illegal means," the agent unapologetically said as another brought out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them on Fuyutsuki's wrists. "You have the right to remain silent, and anything you say or do may be used against you," the agent added, invoking the localized version of the famous American Miranda Law.  
“因叛国、煽动叛乱及非法手段密谋推翻指挥官，”特工毫无歉意地说道，另一名特工随即拿出手铐，咔嚓一声铐在冬月的手腕上。“你有权保持沉默，你所说或所做的一切都可能被用来作为指控你的证据，”特工补充道，援引了美国著名的米兰达法在当地版本的条款。

The old man then sighed in defeat, and without resistance he went along with the agents. Worse, he was yet to be informed that Director Hamamoto and Ritsuko Akagi were also arrested at the same time, and there was also no way for him to know how Kaworu Nagisa and Rei Ayanami would be detained and where.  
老人随后叹息着认输，毫无反抗地随特工们离去。更糟糕的是，他还未被告知滨元导演和赤木律子也在同一时间被捕，更无从得知渚薰和绫波丽将被拘留以及关押何处。

However, he hoped that the rest of those in the know might be able to get Makoto's warning and act immediately.  
然而，他希望其他知情者或许能收到真嗣的警告并立即采取行动。

**Author's Notes:** Like some parts that I envisioned while conceiving this fic years ago, this was once a snippet of scenery which I was now able to expand on, an extended version of the final meeting between Kaworu and SEELE. Furthermore, from this point onward even I wonder how I'll be wrapping up Season Three, as I'm slowly deviating further from the original plot of Episode 24.  
作者笔记：就像多年前构思这篇同人文时脑海中的一些片段，这原本是一个场景片段，现在我得以扩展，是碇真嗣与 SEELE 最终会面的加长版。此外，从这一点开始，我甚至好奇自己将如何收尾第三季，因为我正逐渐偏离第 24 集的原剧情。

But not to worry, I'll try to do my best to deliver on a regular basis (even as I'm also working on an _Eva_ crossover with _Madoka Magica_), and to those who put this fic up on their Story Alerts, I thank you very much for your appreciation.  
但请不用担心，我会尽力定期更新（尽管我也在忙于制作《EVA》与《魔法少女小圆》的跨界作品），对于那些将此文加入故事提醒的读者，我非常感谢你们的欣赏。

### Chapter 37 The Road to Golgotha  
第 37 章 通往各各他之路

They couldn't just believe what Commander Ikari was able to do to them, and how did he know what they were up to?  
他们无法相信伊卡里司令能对他们做出这样的事，他又是怎么知道他们的计划的？

This was what Kozo Fuyutsuki had in mind as his eyes gazed at the others, jailed just like him, and they were all upset: Hamamoto was seething with anger, his hands gripping the edge of the cot as if he was about to tear it off; Ritsuko had a similar expression on her face, while consoling Maya, shedding tears as the junior officer had her head on the older woman's lap; even Shigeru Aoba had his arms crossed, while sitting on the floor, breathing heavily while trying not to blow up his top.  
这就是副司令傅月浩二心中的想法，他的目光扫过其他人，他们和他一样被囚禁着，每个人都情绪激动：滨本愤怒至极，双手紧抓着床沿，仿佛要将其撕裂；律子脸上也带着相似的表情，同时安慰着哭泣的玛雅，后者将头靠在她的膝上；甚至连青叶茂也双臂交叉坐在地上，喘着粗气，努力不让自己爆发。

Hamamoto groaned and muttered, "This bastard is damn amazing, and this confirms that he's near a mind reader. Surely a sign he's so fucking paranoid because he knows that his pet project would be completed soon and he doesn't want anyone to ruin his party, and sir, has he ever got an extra course in Machiavelli 101 for this?"  
滨本呻吟着低声说：“这个混蛋真是太厉害了，这证明他几乎是个读心者。肯定是因为他知道自己的宠物项目即将完成，不想让任何人破坏他的庆功宴，而且，长官，他是不是还额外修了马基雅维利 101 课程？”

It was utterly humiliating for the now-deposed head of Section Two to lose his office more than thirty minutes after he issued an order to search for any form of possible sabotage in the entire base. As he was directing the other agents to check vital facilities, he hadn't expected Morrissey to show up with Ikari's personal retinue of guards, and with indifference shove the arrest warrant right in his face. Next thing he witnessed was having a pair of handcuffs coming down on his own wrists.  
对于这位刚刚被罢免的第二部门负责人来说，在发出全基地搜索任何可能破坏行为的命令后不到三十分钟就失去了办公室，这简直是莫大的羞辱。当他指挥其他特工检查关键设施时，没想到莫里西会带着碇的私人卫队出现，并冷漠地将逮捕令直接塞到他脸上。接下来，他看到的是一副手铐落在了自己的手腕上。

He'd been betrayed by his own second-in-command, and he hated the smug look on Morrissey's face as the turncoats dragged him off to the Stockade; he suspected the limey for months, especially his unsavory character, but in the end Morrissey was really an opportunist, waiting for him to fall.  
他被自己的副手背叛了，他憎恨莫里西那副得意的嘴脸，当这些叛徒把他拖往禁闭室时；他怀疑这个英国人已经好几个月了，尤其是他那令人不快的性格，但最终莫里西确实是个机会主义者，等着他倒台。

Once more he sighed, and said, "I couldn't believe it…"  
他再次叹了口气，说道：“我简直不敢相信……”

"I should've… No, I mean, we should've known this was coming," Fuyutsuki added. "But I never thought it would be this soon."  
"我本该……不，我是说，我们本该预料到这一天的，" 冬月补充道。"但我从未想过会这么快。"

Nobody else said a word, each to their own sordid thoughts, but feared that with Ikari now seemingly unstoppable, soon the worst may yet to come with all of them having a front row seat of the apocalypse.  
其他人一言不发，各自沉浸在纷乱的思绪中，但都担心随着碇源堂如今似乎势不可挡，不久的将来，他们可能将亲眼目睹末日的降临，成为这场浩劫的前排观众。

Helplessly they all wondered, _What are we going to do now?_  
他们无助地思索着，我们现在该怎么办？

"Wait," Ritsuko spoke, finally breaking the silence. "We may have only one chance."  
"等等，" 律子终于打破了沉默，"我们可能只有一次机会。"

"What?" Hamamoto questioned. "You have an idea?"  
"什么？" 滨本问道，"你有什么主意吗？"

"They have yet to catch Misato and Makoto," Ritsuko said, "and they're probably out there somewhere."  
"他们还没抓到美里和真，" 律子说，"他们可能就在外面某个地方。"

Fuyutsuki blinked. "Really?" he asked as the rest focused their attention at the dye-blond woman.  
冬月眨了眨眼。“真的吗？”他问道，其他人则将注意力集中在那位染金发的女子身上。

Ritsuko nodded. "I'm sure her instincts are at work once again," she said. "If she knows that we're all here, then I'm also sure that she'll get us out, come hell or high water."  
律子点了点头。“我相信她的直觉再次发挥了作用，”她说，“如果她知道我们都在这里，那么我也确信，无论是地狱还是洪水，她都会把我们救出去。”

The idea of Misato Katsuragi breaking them out of jail suddenly brightened their moods and heightened their hopes, and this led to Hamamoto wondering if he had an army of loyalists within his department willing to do the same thing for them, hoping that not all of them were happy with Morrissey in charge.  
想到葛城美里能将他们从监狱中救出的想法突然让他们的情绪高涨，希望也随之提升，这让滨本不禁思考，他的部门内是否有一支忠诚的队伍愿意为他们做同样的事情，希望并非所有人都对莫里西掌权感到满意。

And among a few good men whom Hamamoto trusted completely, one of them was Tsutomo Kanzaki, who at the moment was sleeping with Natsumi Odani in her home.  
在滨本完全信任的几个好人中，有一位是堤本勤，此刻他正与尾谷夏美在她家中同眠。

_In her drugged sleep, Rei was dreaming once more.  
在药物作用下的沉睡中，丽再次进入了梦境。_

_Wearing a blue silk kimono_ _patterned with blossoms and clouds, she found herself in a huge, exquisitely-decorated imperial palace, fit for an emperor with its many rooms and hallways, lacquered wooden floors polished to a near-mirror finish, tapestries on the walls, and tatami mats laid out to carpet every floor space._  
她身着一件绘有花朵和云彩图案的蓝色丝绸和服，置身于一座宏伟且装饰精美的皇宫之中，这座宫殿适合一位皇帝居住，拥有众多房间和走廊，漆木地板打磨得近乎镜面般光滑，墙上挂着挂毯，榻榻米铺满了每一寸地面。

_Outside this palace, situated on a hill, was a lush stone garden, shaded by gingko, cherry and pine trees, and birds chirping while perched on its branches. Beyond and below that, over a low stone wall, was a river, whose waters glistened in the sun, and an arched bridge spanned across its grassy banks, painted in red and embellished with decorative motifs, and out there was a seemingly endless expanse of rice fields and pastures.  
在这座位于山丘上的宫殿外，是一片郁郁葱葱的石园，银杏、樱花和松树为其遮荫，鸟儿栖息在枝头欢唱。越过低矮的石墙，下方是一条河流，阳光下波光粼粼，一座红色拱桥横跨在绿草如茵的岸边，装饰着精美的图案。远处是无边无际的稻田和牧场。_

_But r__ight before her and occupying much of the room was a large weaving machine, its frame and mechanism shining and overlaid with gold leaf, and Rei was producing yard after yard of finished silk from delicate threads as she pedaled the machine, rich with color as the dye magically infusing itself into the fabric as it came out of the machine, and in seemingly endless combinations of beautiful patterns.  
但就在她面前，占据了房间大部分空间的是一台巨大的织布机，其框架和机械闪闪发光，覆盖着金箔，丽正在这台机器上脚踏着，源源不断地织出成匹的精美丝绸，色彩丰富，染料仿佛魔法般融入布料中，呈现出无数美丽的图案组合。_

For whom this silk was made for? _she wondered while carrying out her imaginary labors before she heard animal noises in the distance, buoyed by the breeze coming into the chamber though the open doors._  
她一边在想象中辛勤劳作，一边疑惑这些丝绸是为谁而织。就在这时，她听到了远处传来的动物叫声，被吹进房间的微风所携带着。

_T__he noise was the sound of brown-furred cows braying and mooing, the bells tied to their necks and clanking as they hunkered down the banks on the other side of the river to drink and bathe after half a day's worth of grass. Without letting go of the machine Rei watched this simple spectacle, before she noticed the cow-herder as he tipped his straw hat, revealing his face.  
那声音是棕毛奶牛的嘶叫与哞鸣，它们颈上系着的铃铛随着低头下河岸饮水沐浴的动作而叮当作响，那是半日牧草后的休憩。雷并未松开手中的机器，只是静静观赏着这番朴素的景象，直到她注意到那位牧牛人，他正轻掀草帽，露出面容。_

_It was Kaworu_ _in a peasant's dark blue yukata, the water up to his knees while holding a staff in his right hand. With his other hand he waved to greet her like a simple commoner, rather than to bow deeply in homage as though Rei was a child of a living god._  
那是身着深蓝色农夫浴衣的渚，水深及膝，右手持杖。他用另一只手向她挥手致意，如同一个普通的平民，而非深深鞠躬，仿佛雷是活神的子嗣。

What are you doing there? _he asked Rei as if through telepathy._  
你在那里做什么呢？他仿佛通过心灵感应般问雷。

I am weaving, _Rei answered._  
我在编织，丽回答道。

For whom and why?  
为了谁，又是为什么？

_Rei blinked twice, and deciding she had no answer, the girl let go of the weaving machine,_ _causing the contraption to stop moving, before she stood up and rushed out of the mansion, her feet suddenly shod in slippers. She ran across the garden, broke through the wooden gate, surprising the guards, and came down the stone stairway until she reached the bottom, where a road laid in sandstone led all the way to the bridge, and once more she sprinted, hoping she could reach Kaworu._  
丽眨了两次眼，觉得无法回答，于是她松开了织布机，机器随之停止了运转。她站起身，匆匆跑出宅邸，脚上不知何时已换上了拖鞋。她穿过花园，冲破木门，惊动了守卫，沿着石阶一路跑到尽头，一条铺着砂岩的路直通向桥边，她再次疾跑，希望能赶到渚薰那里。

_But just as she was close to setting foot on the arched bridge, without warning the middle span_ _was blown apart and outwards into splinters and dust, creating a huge cloud of debris over the river. The explosion's shockwave slammed Rei back onto the road, causing her to be dazed for a few moments until she struggled to get up onto her feet._  
但就在她即将踏上那座拱桥之际，毫无预警地，桥的中段突然爆炸，向外炸裂成碎片和尘埃，在河面上空形成了一片巨大的碎屑云。爆炸的冲击波将丽猛地推回路面，使她一时晕眩，挣扎着才勉强站起身来。

_Now the_ _imperial bridge was cut in half, which meant that she was forever to be isolated from Kaworu, and as she turned around she saw Commander Ikari, dressed in a shogun's traditional heavy set of full battle armor and a pair of swords hanging from his left side. He walked towards her, grabbed the girl's right wrist, and with a fierce scowl close to her face, he said in an icy voice:_  
如今，这座帝国桥梁已被一分为二，这意味着她将永远与渚隔绝。当她转身时，她看到了指挥官碇，身着将军传统的重型全套战甲，左侧挂着一对剑。他向她走来，抓住女孩的右手腕，带着近乎凶狠的怒容贴近她的脸，用冰冷的声音说道：

Rei, you have a purpose. You are the vessel in which you must deliver Yui to me; bring her back into my arms at the cost of your life.  
丽，你有你的使命。你是要将唯带回我身边的容器；哪怕牺牲自己的生命，也要让她回到我的怀抱。

That is your duty, and that is what you are made for.  
这是你的职责，也是你存在的意义。

_And tears broke out of her eyes.  
泪水从她的眼中涌出。_

---

The First Children woke up with a start, the first sight of her tear-filled eyes, as she blinked, revealed her surroundings, and it dawned upon her that she was now a prisoner, caged in a Plexiglas cube suspended from the ceiling by a thick column of steel, surrounded by a circle of rotating black columns, in a huge spherical room completely walled in and laid up with tiles of foam cones, save for a single camera aimed at her.  
第一代孩子们猛然惊醒，泪眼朦胧中，她眨了眨眼，看清了四周环境，随即意识到自己已成为阶下囚，被囚禁在一个由厚实钢柱支撑、悬挂于天花板的 Plexiglas 立方体内，四周环绕着一圈旋转的黑柱，身处一个巨大的球形房间内，墙壁铺满了泡沫锥形瓷砖，唯有一台摄像机对准了她。

Strapped to a seat bolted to the floor, Rei tugged at the belts restraining her wrists and ankles, and knew instantly that there was no way she would be able to escape; the rotating columns were powerful inhibitors called Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars, designed to neutralize and contain Angelic energies and thwart any attempt at generating an AT-Field.  
被固定在地板上焊接的座椅上，绫波丽挣扎着试图解开束缚手腕和脚踝的带子，立刻明白自己无法逃脱；那些旋转的柱子是名为天使封印六芒柱的强力抑制器，旨在中和并封存天使能量，阻止任何生成 AT 力场的企图。

Breathing in shallow gasps, Rei couldn't believe that she was here, and judging by the ruthless amount of security imposed upon her, it was clear that Commander Ikari was steely determined to keep her in place.  
绫波丽喘息着，难以置信自己竟落得如此境地，而从施加在她身上的严密安保措施来看，显然碇司令决心坚定，不容她有任何脱逃之念。

She also knew what this chamber was made for, and the Commander once told her that its original purpose was to keep and isolate captured Angel embryo for further study, but the only attempt at obtaining one of those Angels at such a stage ended in futility when the target creature broke out of its shell deep in a volcano, forcing Asuka and Unit-02 to kill it.  
她也知道这个房间是用来做什么的，指挥官曾告诉她，其最初目的是用来保存和隔离捕获的天使胚胎以供进一步研究，但唯一一次试图获取这种阶段的天使的尝试以失败告终，目标生物在火山深处破壳而出，迫使明日香和二号机将其击杀。

Dejected and defeated, Rei hung her head downward, her hopes extinguished as she was sure that Kaworu was imprisoned in another of these chambers like this one.  
沮丧且挫败，绫波零低垂着头，她的希望破灭了，她确信渚薰被囚禁在另一个这样的房间里。

"Good morning," Gendo greeted her through a loudspeaker installed somewhere in this chamber, causing Rei's eyes to fly open.  
“早上好，”碇源堂通过安装在房间某处的扩音器向她问候，这让绫波零的眼睛猛地睁开。

"What wrong I have done?" Rei questioned in a calm voice, trying not to show weakness or any attempt at struggling from the straps bounding her down.  
“我做错了什么？” 绫波平静地问道，尽量不表现出软弱或试图从束缚她的带子中挣扎。

"This is for your own good," Gendo answered. "I want to protect you from yourself, just as I have to protect Nagisa from himself, but both of you still have a purpose."  
“这是为你好，” 源度回答道。“我想保护你免受自己的伤害，就像我必须保护渚免受自己的伤害一样，但你们俩仍有其存在的意义。”

Rei swallowed hard, but she felt a sharp pain. Seeking for its source by craning her neck to the left, she saw that there was an IV needle stuck to her left arm, its slim tube leading upwards, feeding her drips of dextrose through the bloodstream.  
绫波艰难地咽了咽，却感到一阵剧痛。她扭头向左寻找痛源，发现左臂上插着一根静脉注射针，细管向上延伸，通过血液输送着葡萄糖点滴。

"I know my purpose, but that is not yours to alter," Rei said.  
“我明白我的使命，但这不是你能改变的，”丽说道。

"It stands as it is," Gendo replied, with a confident tone in his voice. "Soon, once Instrumentality happens, you'll have to take me to Yui's side. That's your final duty."  
“它就这样存在，”碇源堂回答，语气中带着自信。“很快，一旦人类补完计划启动，你就得带我去见唯。那是你最后的职责。”

Rei closed her eyes hard as if to think for a moment, and opened them again, her cerise eyes flashing with defiance as if her will would burn through the steel-lined, concrete shell.  
丽紧紧闭上眼睛，仿佛在思考片刻，然后再次睁开，她那紫红色的眼眸闪烁着反抗的光芒，仿佛她的意志能穿透这钢筋混凝土的坚固外壳。

"_I am not your doll_," she declared. "I am not you."  
"我不是你的玩偶，"她宣称，"我不是你。"

For a moment afterwards she heard nothing from Gendo, and her mind began to count the seconds, then minutes, until he broke the silence once more.  
之后的一段时间里，她没有听到源堂的任何声音，她的思绪开始计算秒数，然后是分钟，直到他再次打破沉默。

"Nobody will try to save you or Nagisa, nor will somebody try to stop me from doing what I planned to do for a long time," Gendo spoke back. "The people whom I entrusted once have attempted to usurp my authority and to seize NERV from me by force. They have taken advantage of the discord that the Committee has generated through terrorism to question my leadership and to undermine the stability I have established to keep this organization in order."  
"没有人会试图救你或渚，也不会有人试图阻止我实施我计划已久的行动，"源堂回应道，"那些我曾信任的人试图篡夺我的权力，用武力夺取 NERV。他们利用委员会通过恐怖主义制造的分歧，质疑我的领导，破坏我为维持组织秩序所建立的稳定。"

Gendo paused for a second and then added, "Fuyutsuki, Akagi, Hamamoto and some other conspirators close to them have been captured and jailed for their abortive attempt. Likewise I have enacted a manhunt to seek and arrest Colonel Katsuragi and her aide Lieutenant Hyuga, and later on I shall issue further arrest orders and name names to bring down others involved in this conspiracy. As for the Committee's spies, they will likewise be dealt with extreme prejudice."  
源渡停顿了一秒，然后补充道：“冬月、赤木、滨本以及他们身边的一些同谋者，因企图失败已被捕入狱。同样，我已下令追捕葛城美里上校及其助手日向诚中尉，稍后我将发布更多逮捕令，点名清除其他涉案人员。至于委员会的间谍，他们也将受到极端的对待。”

Rei said nothing, as Gendo sighed in pleasure.  
绫波没有说话，源渡则满意地叹了口气。

"As soon as the Third Children wakes up later," he said. "He'll do as I say as soon as he discovers the true purpose of his friend Nagisa, and I'm sure you know him on an intimate level. Of course that Angel will die as predicted in the Scrolls, thereby leaving us the final phase in implementing Instrumentality."  
“一旦三号机驾驶员醒来，”他说，“一旦他发现他的朋友渚薰的真实目的，他就会按照我的指示行事，我确信你与他有着亲密的了解。当然，那个使徒会如预言卷轴中所预言的那样死去，从而让我们进入实现人类补完计划的最后阶段。”

"My brother and Asuka might as well stop this insanity of yours, and that of the Committee, with their own terms," Rei said in defiance.  
"我哥哥和明日香或许能用他们自己的方式，终止你和委员会的这种疯狂行径，" 绫波带着反抗的语气说道。

"Well," Gendo said. "I'm surprised at your language, and how fast you were able to speak in such a refreshing way. Where did you learn it from whom? And you call the Third Children your brother?"  
"嗯，" 源渡说道。"我对你使用的语言感到惊讶，以及你如此迅速地以一种令人耳目一新的方式表达。你是从谁那里学来的？而且你称第三适格者为你的哥哥？

"Yes, Shinji is my _brother_," the First Children said, this time using Shinji's given name rather than the usual surname.  
"是的，真嗣是我的哥哥，" 第一适格者这次使用了真嗣的名字，而不是通常的姓氏。

"How did you know?"  
"你怎么知道的？"

"We are both related by blood and DNA, and you were supposed to be our _father_," Rei replied. "But you betrayed him, you crushed his hopes for you as a father, and you made me a tool for your exploitation, to be disposed of afterwards, just like the other copies of me that Akagi destroyed out of her hatred for you."  
"我们之间有着血缘和 DNA 的联系，你本应是我们的父亲，" 丽回答道。"但你背叛了他，你粉碎了他作为父亲对你的期望，还把我变成了你利用的工具，用完即弃，就像赤木博士因对你的恨而毁掉的那些我的复制品一样。"

By the sheer force of Rei's searing retort, and the way she spoke, completely out of line for her normally docile and obedient character, Gendo realized that he was arguing with the outraged reincarnation of his late wife.  
丽那炽热的反驳和说话的方式，完全不符合她平时温顺听话的性格，这让源堂意识到，他正在与已故妻子的愤怒转世争论。

It made him blink for the first time.  
这让他第一次眨了眨眼。

"I have finally understood _Mother_, her purpose of using Eva for good, and that she brought meaning to your life," Rei said. "Mother was everything to you, and she gave you everything that you could not have. But once she left this world and suddenly you felt empty, what did you gave to Shinji?"  
“我终于明白了母亲，她利用 Eva 行善的目的，以及她给你的生活带来了意义，”丽说。“母亲对你来说就是一切，她给了你所有你无法拥有的东西。但她离开这个世界后，你突然感到空虚，你给了真嗣什么？”

This time it was Gendo's turn to be silenced.  
这次轮到碇源堂沉默了。

"You left him alone," Rei continued. "You gave him despair; you made him suffer and forced him to question his own purpose in this world. He longed for a father like you to love him, yet you did nothing but kept him away while you were obsessed with the idea of bringing Mother back into this world."  
"你让他独自一人，" 丽继续说道。"你给了他绝望；你让他受苦，迫使他质疑自己在这个世界上的存在意义。他渴望像你这样的父亲能爱他，而你除了沉迷于将母亲带回这个世界的念头外，什么也没做，只是将他拒之门外。

Now she could hear Gendo breathing heavily, as though in rage, his confidence shattered with the revelations thrown back into his face.  
现在她能听到源堂沉重地呼吸，仿佛在愤怒中，他的自信随着这些揭露的事实而破碎。

"You are _not_ Yui… Impostor, that is _enough!_" he thundered, voice cackling with controlled fury, and at the same time Rei unexpectedly felt her head spinning once again and her sight fading out as sedatives through the IV line hit the bloodstream and thence to her brain, causing the girl to black out in her seat.  
"你不是唯…冒牌货，够了！" 他咆哮道，声音中带着压抑的怒火，与此同时，丽意外地感到一阵头晕目眩，视线逐渐模糊，随着静脉注射的镇静剂进入血液并流向大脑，她昏倒在座位上。

---

In his silent rage, face contorted in anger, struggling to breathe as if after being strangled, Gendo made a fist and slammed it on the console. The action startled the three technicians who were monitoring everything in the control room, covered with control panels and monitors, half of them displaying Rei in her seat, as she slumped towards unconsciousness.  
在他无声的愤怒中，面部因愤怒而扭曲，挣扎着呼吸，仿佛刚被扼住喉咙，源渡握紧拳头猛击控制台。这一举动惊动了控制室内的三名技术员，他们正监控着一切，房间里布满了控制面板和监视器，其中一半显示着丽坐在座位上，正向昏迷倾斜。

He then turned to one of the technicians, who looked nervous, and said, "Keep an eye on her, and whatever you've seen or heard here should never leave this place. Understand?"  
随后，他转向其中一位显得紧张的技术员，说道：“盯紧她，你们在这里看到或听到的任何事情，绝不能泄露出去。明白吗？”

"Yes, sir," the technicians replied, nodding in obedience, trying not to be cowed by the man's intense gaze and stony face.  
“是，长官，”技术员们回答道，点头表示服从，尽量不被那人锐利的目光和冷峻的面容所吓倒。

Gendo now focused his attention at the other half of monitors devoted to Kaworu Nagisa, still in controlled coma, strapped in his seat, unaware that he was about to be made as a sacrifice in the coming hours. He then picked up one of the phones and dialed Morrissey's number. The man on the other end answered.  
源渡现在将注意力集中在另一半显示着渚薰的监视器上，他仍处于受控昏迷状态，被束缚在座位上，浑然不知自己即将在接下来的几个小时内成为牺牲品。随后，他拿起一部电话，拨通了莫里森的号码。对方接听了。

"Orders, sir?" Morrissey asked.  
“命令是什么，长官？”莫里森问道。

"By oh-five-hundred hours, prepare the Seventeenth Angel to be moved to Terminal Dogma and position him there," he ordered, before he put down the phone and stormed out of the control room, heading back to his living quarters to take a nap; once he wakes up again later, he'll be at the command center just in time to witness the final moments of Kaworu Nagisa's brief existence.  
“在五点前，准备好第十七使徒，将其移至中央教条区并安置在那里，”他命令道，随后挂断电话，怒气冲冲地离开了控制室，返回住处小憩；待他稍后醒来，便能及时赶到指挥中心，见证渚薰短暂生命的终结时刻。

"Children," he muttered in disgust while walking, passing through the door, and over it was a sign that said: **ANGEL CONTAINMENT FACILITY – RESTRICTED AREA**.  
“孩子们，”他厌恶地咕哝着，一边走一边穿过门，门上挂着一块牌子：天使收容设施——禁区。

---

From an entrance, bored into the mountain and located three kilometers away from the center of what was once Tokyo-3, Misato and Makoto were now in one of the emergency access tunnels leading down to the Geofront, after leaving the Alpine hidden behind thick bushes. She knew because the Children once told her about this passageway when one of the Angels attacked the city by completely disabling electrical flow in a wide radius, including power for the elevators and the doors. They used this tunnel to gain access to reach their Evas in time, but not without encountering a series of obstacles along the way, which included wrong turns, and then an elevator going more than a kilometer down to the complex.  
从山中开凿出的入口，距离曾是东京-3 中心三公里远，美里和诚现在正身处一条紧急通道中，这条通道通往地底都市，他们离开隐藏在茂密灌木丛后的阿尔卑斯山后便来到了这里。她之所以知道这条通道，是因为孩子们曾告诉过她，当一次使徒袭击城市，完全切断了广阔区域内的电力供应，包括电梯和门禁的电源时，他们就是通过这条通道及时到达 EVA 处。但这一路并非没有遇到障碍，包括走错路，以及乘坐下降超过一公里的电梯到达地下设施。

They were halfway through when they encountered a high wall about seven feet tall, and the door that was once there was sealed off with concrete and mortar blocks. Makoto had no choice but to let Misato stand on his shoulders, and at the same time keep her laptop secured in its bag, still dangling to his left shoulder.  
他们走到一半时，遇到了一堵约七英尺高的墙，原本在那里的门已被混凝土和砂浆块封死。诚别无选择，只能让美里站在他的肩膀上，同时确保她肩上的笔记本电脑包安全无虞，依旧挂在他的左肩上。

"Okay, a few more," she said as Makoto strained against her weight, struggling to keep himself upright before his feet and legs exerted more strength to carry her up. Meanwhile she was able to acquire a hold onto the top of the wall, and pulled herself upwards.  
“好了，再来几次，”她边说边感受到真琴在她体重下挣扎，努力保持直立，直到他的双脚和双腿再次发力将她撑起。与此同时，她设法抓住了墙顶，并用力将自己拉了上去。

Panting and perched on top, Misato reached downward with an open hand. "Now, get my hand!" she ordered and Makoto clasped to her hand and gripping it, and then with available strength she pulled him up.  
喘着气坐在墙顶，美里伸出手向下。“现在，抓住我的手！”她命令道，真琴紧紧握住她的手，她便用剩余的力气将他拉了上来。

"C'mon, one more!" she barked.  
“来吧，再来一次！”她催促道。

"Okay!" Makoto answered, his feet clawing against the wall, trying not to make one slip or they could fall down altogether, until he finally made it.  
“好的！”真琴回答道，他的脚爪紧抓着墙壁，努力不让自己滑倒，否则他们可能会一起摔下去，直到他终于成功。

With one hand trying to keep the laptop against his body and from falling, Makoto steadied himself carefully to leap off to the other side, and let go. He landed on the floor, before Misato followed suit.  
真琴用一只手尽量稳住笔记本电脑，不让它从身上滑落，小心翼翼地准备跳到另一边，然后放手。他落在地板上，随后美里也跟着跳了过来。

Now they dusted themselves off, and as they did Misato said, consulting her watch, "Six past three. We still have enough time."  
现在他们拍掉身上的灰尘，与此同时美里看了看手表，说道：“三点零六分。我们还有足够的时间。”

"Yeah," Makoto said between breaths. "Good thing there weren't any surveillance cameras in here."  
“嗯，”真琴喘着气说，“幸好这里没有监控摄像头。”

Their eyes adjusted to the near-darkness, the chamber being lit by a red light bulb, until they could make out the breadth and width; there were boxes lined up along the wall, and as they walked through this corridor they could smell the dust, accumulated through the years this place was left untouched.  
他们的眼睛适应了几乎黑暗的环境，房间里只有一盏红灯泡照明，直到他们能看清房间的宽度和长度；墙壁边堆满了箱子，当他们穿过这条走廊时，能闻到积年累月未曾触碰的灰尘。

But as they passed by one of the huge ventilators, its fan whirling loudly, Misato saw that its access door was blocked with yellow plastic strips, and upon closer look on one of the strips it read, in Helvetica block letters:  
但当他们经过其中一个巨大的通风口时，风扇发出巨大的嗡嗡声，美里注意到通风口的检修门被黄色塑料条封住了，仔细一看，其中一条上用 Helvetica 粗体字母写着：

**CRIME SCENE – DO NOT CROSS – NERV** **DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE**  
犯罪现场 – 禁止跨越 – NERV 安全情报部

Misato and Makoto looked at each other, before glancing at the room just beyond the off-limits tape. The woman sighed.  
美里和真琴互相对视了一眼，然后瞥向了那条禁止入内胶带后的房间。美里叹了口气。

"Isn't the last time Kaji was here, right?" Makoto asked.  
“上次加持来过这里，对吧？”真琴问道。

"Yeah," Misato said, tinge of sorrow in her voice, before she cautiously went under the tape.  
“嗯，”美里说道，声音中带着一丝悲伤，然后小心翼翼地钻过了胶带。

"What are you doing?" Makoto pleaded. "We don't have much—"  
“你在做什么？”真琴恳求道，“我们没有多少时间——”

Misato signaled him with an upraised hand. "Wait," she responded as she knelt down right before the chalk-marked outline where Kaji fell. "I need to reflect first," she added. "Give me a minute."  
美里举起手示意他停下。“等等，”她回应着，跪在了加治倒下的粉笔轮廓前，“我需要先思考一下，”她补充道，“给我一分钟。”

"Okay," Makoto said. “好的，”真琴说。

The woman then stared at the dried pool of blood, now weeks old, and closed her eyes. In her mind's sight and thoughts flipping through her photo album of memories, Misato willed herself to remember the good times she had with Kaji: happy moments, tense moments, funny and the awkward, and the only time she was able to confess about her feelings.  
那女人随后凝视着那滩已干涸数周的血迹，闭上了眼睛。在她的心灵视野中，思绪翻阅着记忆相册，美里努力让自己回忆起与加持共度的美好时光：快乐的时刻，紧张的时刻，滑稽与尴尬的时刻，以及她唯一一次坦露心声的时刻。

She could only imagine him being here, watching at this very moment, the only sound she could also here was the whirling of the ventilator's fan blades.  
她只能想象他就在这里，此刻正注视着这一切，唯一能听到的声音便是通风扇叶的旋转声。

"Kaji, give me strength," Misato whispered. "We'll be facing the toughest time of our lives, and you may not be here, but... I still don't forget you, and I thank you for entrusting me the secrets of this place, which I hope may help us decide the fate of this world."  
"加持，赐予我力量吧，" 美里低声说道。"我们将面临生命中最艰难的时刻，而你可能不在身边，但是...我从未忘记你，感谢你将这里的秘密托付给我，希望这些能帮助我们决定这个世界的命运。"

Making one last sigh, Misato then stood up and added, "Someday, I'll be seeing you again." She turned around and walked back to Makoto, who looked solemn.  
最后叹了一口气，美里站起身来，补充道："总有一天，我们会再见的。"她转过身，走回真琴身边，后者神情肃穆。

"Well?" he asked as they stepped out of the crime scene.  
"怎么样？" 他们走出犯罪现场时，他问道。

"There are things and people we should be thankful for, even for the smallest chances," she said as they trudged onwards. "Okay, first thing we have to do, if some of them are locked out, is to contact Tomo."  
"有些事情和人值得我们感激，哪怕是微小的机会，"她一边艰难前行一边说道。"好吧，我们首先要做的，如果有些人被锁在外面了，就是联系智。"

Makoto chuckled. "Yeah, I'm sure he's with Natsumi."  
真琴轻笑道："是啊，我敢肯定他和夏美在一起。"

"Given that they're almost loaded by the time they left early," she said, "I suppose he slept with her. After all, it's no secret to me that he wanted to have a date, and he got his wish."  
"考虑到他们离开时几乎已经准备妥当，"她说，"我想他应该是和她一起睡了。毕竟，他想约会的愿望已经不是秘密了，他如愿以偿了。"

The bespectacled officer nodded. "Ah… What about Chacon and Nguyen? They're really on the outside, but we could also trust them."  
戴眼镜的警官点了点头。“啊……那查康和阮呢？他们虽然在外围，但我们也可以信任他们。”

"Great idea," Misato answered in approval. "You got their numbers?"  
“好主意，”美里赞同地回答，“你有他们的号码吗？”

Makoto shook his head. "No, but I'll check the directory as soon as we can get within wireless net range."  
真琴摇了摇头。“没有，但只要我们能进入无线网络范围，我就会查一下通讯录。”

"Good. We'll need their help, and then we also have to get to Shinji and Asuka, too," she said. "Same thing with Kaworu and Rei, but I guess they're in much deeper."  
“好。我们需要他们的帮助，然后还得找到真嗣和明日香。”她说，“同样的事情也适用于薰和绫波，不过我想他们的情况更复杂。”

Makoto blinked. "Wait… apart from the guards, who's going to deal with the surveillance systems? Only a few have access to the cameras, doors and sensors, you know, and with all that, with us already marked, there's no way we could make it to the Stockade."  
真琴眨了眨眼。“等等……除了警卫，谁来处理监控系统？只有少数人有权限接触摄像头、门和传感器，你知道的，而且我们已经被标记了，根本不可能进入拘留区。”

But Misato grinned. "That's where Natsumi comes in," she said, "because I believe she still has authorization to use the MAGI, thereby giving her full access to the entire system."  
但美里笑了。“这就是夏美的用武之地，”她说，“因为我相信她仍然有权使用 MAGI，从而获得整个系统的完全访问权限。”

This time Makoto laughed. "You're a genius, and I'm not kidding."  
这次真琴笑了。“你真是个天才，我不是开玩笑。”

"Thanks," she replied. “谢谢，”她回答道。

By the time they made it to the threshold of the installation, cautiously tiptoeing and dodging surveillance cameras visibly placed every 100 meters, and hiding into rooms whenever they thought they saw people coming their way, the duo peered up at the sign above their heads:  
当他们小心翼翼地踮着脚尖，躲避每隔 100 米明显放置的监控摄像头，并在认为有人来时躲进房间，这对搭档抬头看向头顶的标志：

**BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH LAB** **– BIOHAZARD/PATHOGEN WARNING – UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL PROHIBITED**  
生物研究实验室 – 生物危害/病原体警告 – 未经授权人员禁止入内

Beyond that sign was an airlock just ahead of them; and to the left of the airlock door was a side-room indicating where hazmat suits were kept.  
在那标志之后，他们前方是一个气锁舱；气锁门左侧有一个小房间，标示着存放防护服的位置。

"Let's get there," Misato said, before darting across and reached the door, and then she opened it. There they went in and quickly wore the suits hanging from racks, and then put on wrap-around masks and rebreathers, thus completing their disguises. To complete their spacemen-like masquerade, Makoto took hold of a large cart and a pack of plastic bags with the word BIOHAZARD printed on, before placing the laptop inside and off they went to a bank of waiting elevators.  
“我们过去吧，”美里说道，随即快步穿过并到达门口，然后她打开了门。他们进入后迅速穿上挂在架子上的防护服，接着戴上环绕式口罩和呼吸器，完成了伪装。为了更像太空人，真琴拿起一辆大推车和一包印有生物危害字样的塑料袋，将笔记本电脑放入其中，然后他们前往一排等候的电梯。

Now once inside in one of the elevators, Misato punched the button for the hangar bay where the aviation squadron kept its aircraft and housed the pilots who flew them. As the elevator surged downward, taking off their masks for a moment, Makoto used the laptop to access the network and taking hold of the online directory.  
现在一进入电梯，美里就按下了通往机库的按钮，那里是航空中队存放飞机和飞行员居住的地方。随着电梯急速下降，诚人暂时摘下口罩，利用笔记本电脑接入网络，并抓住在线目录。

"There," Makoto said, pointing at the line within the list, denoting Trudy and Paul's phone numbers. "That's their numbers."  
“这里，”诚人说着，指向列表中的一行，标示着特鲁迪和保罗的电话号码。“这是他们的号码。”

"Good," Misato replied before dialing Paul's phone.  
“很好，”美里回答，随即拨打了保罗的电话。

---

In their quarters, adjacent to the hangar where NERV's helicopter and VTOL aircraft were stored and maintained, and while sleeping on the couch, Paul was unexpectedly awakened by the vibration coming from his mobile phone. He slowly picked it up from his side and answered. "Hello?" he asked in a sleepy voice. "Isn't it too early for this?"  
在他们的住处，紧邻 NERV 的直升机和垂直起降飞机存放与维护的机库，保罗正躺在沙发上睡觉，却被手机传来的震动意外唤醒。他缓缓从身旁拿起手机，接听了电话。“喂？”他用睡意朦胧的声音问道，“这么早打电话，是不是太早了点？”

"It's me, Paul," Misato said.  
“是我，保罗，”美里说道。

Paul managed a yawn, recognizing her voice. "What's up, Colonel?"  
保罗勉强打了个哈欠，听出了她的声音。“怎么了，上校？”

"We need your help."  
"我们需要你的帮助。"

The pilot blinked, his eyes trying to adjust to the darkness. "Why, ma'am, what's wrong?"  
飞行员眨了眨眼，试图适应黑暗。“怎么了，女士，出什么事了？”

"The Sub-Commander and the others have been arrested."  
"副指挥官和其他人已经被逮捕了。"

This time Paul was shocked, causing him to sit upright. "What?"  
这次保罗震惊了，让他猛地坐直。“什么？”

"I'll explain later, and get yourselves ready, but do you still have your weapon?"  
“我稍后解释，你们准备好，但你还有武器吗？”

"Yeah," Paul answered. "I have a Colt Government, with two more spare mags to go."  
“有，”保罗回答，“我有一把柯尔特政府型手枪，还带了两个备用弹匣。”

"Just great," Misato approved. "Now wake up Trudy because you two have to help me get everyone out of the Stockade. Meet us at the elevators, and fast!"  
"真是太好了，" 美里赞同道。"现在叫醒特鲁迪，因为你们俩得帮我带大家离开拘留所。我们在电梯口见，快点！"

"Roger that," Paul said before Misato closed the line. He then put down his phone on the dresser and walked the expanse of the room, to knock on Trudy's door to her bedroom. He could hear her snoring, followed by the crunching of the bed springs as she got up to her feet.  
"收到，" 保罗说完，美里就挂断了电话。他随后将手机放在梳妆台上，穿过房间，敲响了特鲁迪卧室的门。他能听到她的鼾声，紧接着是床弹簧的嘎吱声，她起身下床。

"Damn it," Trudy answered, her voice muffled by the door. "What the hell do you want?"  
"该死，" 特鲁迪隔着门回答，声音被门板闷住。"你到底想要什么？"

"Get dressed," Paul ordered as he put on his pants. "Colonel Katsuragi needs us for some action… I mean, help her do a jailbreak."  
"穿好衣服，"保罗一边穿裤子一边命令道。"卡茨拉加少校需要我们帮忙……我是说，协助她越狱。"

"WHAT?"

---

By the time they arrived at the elevator hall, Paul whispered, "Where are they?"  
当他们到达电梯大厅时，保罗低声问道："他们在哪儿？"

Poking from the door of the janitor's closet was a hand waving at them. It was Misato, all right, as they scurried towards the door, got in and slammed the door.  
从清洁工的储物间门缝里伸出了一只手向他们挥动。没错，是美里，他们快步走向门口，进去后砰地一声关上了门。

"What's going on?" Trudy asked, taking note of the pile of suits and masks on the floor, which the fugitives had taken off.  
"发生了什么事？" 特鲁迪问道，注意到地上那堆逃亡者刚脱下的西装和面具。

Misato and Makoto explained to them the events and circumstances which led to the wholesale arrests, and she even told about Kaworu and Rei, both of them taken away and caged somewhere in the base; in one fell swoop Commander Ikari decided to remove those he deemed as traitors.  
美里和诚向他们解释了导致大规模逮捕的事件和情况，她甚至提到了被带走并关押在基地某处的渚薰和绫波丽；伊卡洛斯司令一气之下决定清除那些他认为的叛徒。

"So that leaves us unscathed this far," Paul said. "By the way, we're packing heat." He and Trudy then showed them their sidearms: Paul's Model 1911 gleamed in the dim light, in contrast to Trudy's black polymer Glock 17.  
"这样一来，我们至今安然无恙，" 保罗说，"顺便说一句，我们带了武器。" 他和特鲁迪随后展示了他们的配枪：保罗的 M1911 在昏暗的光线下闪闪发光，与特鲁迪的黑色聚合物 Glock 17 形成鲜明对比。

"What about Tsutomo?" Trudy asked as she holstered the Glock back.  
"那 Tsutomo 呢？" Trudy 一边问，一边将 Glock 手枪插回枪套。

"He's with Natsumi," Misato said.  
"他和 Natsumi 在一起，" Misato 回答道。

Trudy chuckled. "Talk about hot coffee."  
Trudy 轻笑一声。"真是热咖啡般的组合。"

Makoto and Misato blinked. "_Hot coffee?_"  
真琴和美里眨了眨眼。“热咖啡？”

"Um… Yeah," Trudy said. "Remember about that game with the 'hot coffee' part?"  
“呃… 是的，”特鲁迪说。“记得那个带有‘热咖啡’部分的游戏吗？”

"Dunno," Makoto said, shrugging his shoulders. "Haven't played something like that."  
“不知道，”真琴耸了耸肩说。“没玩过那样的游戏。”

Trudy shook her head and grinned. "I'll spare you the guessing; It means they really hooked up. In bed. The game that I'm talking about is _GTA:_ _San Andreas._"  
特鲁迪摇了摇头，咧嘴一笑。“我就不让你猜了；这意味着他们真的上床了。我说的游戏是《侠盗猎车手：圣安地列斯》。”

"Ah," Misato said, and then they all burst into laughter.  
“啊，”美里说，然后他们都爆发出笑声。

"You Americans," Makoto said in jest. "Anyway, we need to get to Natsumi's quarters."  
“你们美国人啊，”诚开玩笑地说。“总之，我们得去夏美的房间。”

"Where?' Paul asked. “哪里？”保罗问道。

"It's right up the hillside," Misato said, "We must reach those guys because Tomo has a few friends in Section Two he can trust, and Natsumi knows how to play the MAGI like a harp."  
“就在山坡上，”美里说，“我们必须找到那些人，因为智在第二分部有几个他信任的朋友，而夏美知道如何像弹竖琴一样操作 MAGI。”

---

A few minutes later, Paul and Trudy, both wearing flight suits, were pushing the cart along the hallway when they were spotted by a quartet of roving security troopers in full battle gear. They looked dead-serious.  
几分钟后，保罗和特鲁迪都穿着飞行服，推着推车在走廊上走，这时他们被四名全副武装的巡逻安全士兵发现了。他们看起来非常严肃。

"Sir, have you seen Colonel Katsuragi and Lieutenant Hyuga?" one of the troopers asked Paul, taking note of his collar officer rank.  
“长官，您见过卡苏拉吉上校和早川中尉吗？”一名士兵向保罗问道，注意到他领章上的军衔。

Paul and Trudy shook their heads. "N… No," he said. "We're just getting our laundry washed."  
保罗和特鲁迪摇了摇头。“没……没有，”他说，“我们只是来洗衣服的。”

The trooper peered into the cart, which was indeed full of dirty clothes and linen, before he said, "All right, sir, you may go, but tell us if you spot them."  
士兵探头看了看推车，里面确实装满了脏衣服和床单，然后说：“好的，长官，您可以走了，但如果看到他们请告诉我们。”

"Why?" Trudy asked. "为什么？" 特鲁迪问道。

"We have a warrant for their arrest," the trooper answered. "On Commander Ikari's orders."  
"我们有逮捕他们的令状，" 骑警回答道。"根据碇司令的命令。"

"Damn," Paul said. "What for?"  
"该死，" 保罗说。"因为什么？"

The trooper cleared his throat. "Treason."  
那名士兵清了清喉咙。“叛国。”

"Okay, Sarge, we'll tell you if they show up," Paul said. "Carry on."  
“好的，中士，他们要是出现我们会告诉你的，”保罗说，“继续吧。”

"Yes, sir," the trooper said as they saluted each other, before they walked away.  
“是，长官，”士兵们互相敬礼后，各自走开了。

Once the troopers were out of sight, Paul blew a sigh of relief as Trudy whispered, "That was a close call."  
当士兵们消失在视线之外，保罗松了一口气，特鲁迪低声说：“真是千钧一发。”

"Just stay frosty, guys," Misato said beneath the pile, before they pushed the cart into the elevator, and Paul pressed a button to get them to the motor pool.  
“保持警觉，伙计们，”在推进手推车进入电梯之前，美里在杂物堆下说道，随后保罗按下按钮，将他们送往车辆调配池。

As the elevator lurched upward, Misato and Makoto climbed out of the cart, tossing away the laundry that was heaped on them.  
电梯缓缓上升时，美里和诚从手推车中爬出，将堆在他们身上的衣物扔到一旁。

"That was brilliant," Trudy said. "Good thing they didn't bother to dig in."  
"那真是太棒了，"特鲁迪说。"幸好他们没费心去挖掘。"

"It's also a good thing that they didn't have any dogs to sniff us out," Misato added before the elevator doors opened.  
"他们没有狗来嗅出我们也是件好事，" 美里补充道，就在电梯门打开之前。"

The motor pool was silent by the time they came out of the elevator, and quickly the three of them hopped into an empty Humvee, as Paul went into the maintenance officer's office, took the keys from the rack on the wall near the desk.  
当他们走出电梯时，车库已经一片寂静，三人迅速跳进一辆空着的悍马车，保罗则走进维修官的办公室，从桌旁墙上的钥匙架上取下钥匙。

He then rushed out of the office, got into the driver's seat and gunned the engine.  
他随即冲出办公室，坐进驾驶座，猛踩油门发动了引擎。

"Which way?" Paul asked.  
“走哪条路？”保罗问道。

"Route 6, to the left," Misato said, poking her head from behind his seat.  
“6 号路线，向左转，”美里从他座位后面探出头来说道。

"Roger that," the Cheyenne jock said before he pressed on the gas, rolling out of the garage and onto asphalt. Turning left, he saw the road ahead and it went through the forest, before climbing up the hillside.  
"收到，"那位夏安族运动员说完便踩下油门，驶出车库，开上了柏油路。向左转弯，他看到前方的道路穿过森林，然后蜿蜒爬上山坡。

They passed the minutes talking, mostly about last night's drinking spree, and meanwhile Fuyutsuki checked his watch: 3:35 in the morning, and he wondered what Gendo was scheming next before he remembered the Fifth Children.  
他们边开车边聊，主要是昨晚的狂欢，而此时冬月则看了看手表：凌晨 3 点 35 分，他不禁好奇碇源堂下一步在谋划什么，随即想起了第五适格者。

"I have a bad feeling about what's going to happen to that young man," Fuyutsuki said, causing the others to take notice.  
"我对那个年轻人的未来有种不祥的预感，"冬月说道，引起了其他人的注意。

"Who?" Ritsuko asked, this time Maya sleeping on her lap.  
"谁？" 律子问道，这会儿玛雅正睡在她膝上。

"I'm sure Ikari has Nagisa by the neck, and without us to stop him, he's free to do whatever he wants… Good grief, it means he's determined to go further than the Committee."  
"我敢肯定，碇已经把渚掐在手里了，而且没有我们在旁边阻止他，他可以为所欲为……真是的，这意味着他决心要走得比委员会更远。

"Haste makes waste, I suppose," the woman remarked. "But not him; he'll try to micromanage everything."  
"欲速则不达，我想，" 女人评论道，"但他不会；他会试图事无巨细地掌控一切。

"Like Hitler," Hamamoto chimed in as he flexed his toes. "He'll overrule his generals, even if they offered him good advice and prudence. Thus in his madness, along with the failure of Operation Valkyrie, which was an assassination attempt supposed to take him down, he drove Germany into hell till he blew off his own head. Sounds familiar?"  
"像希特勒一样，" 滨本插话道，同时活动着脚趾。"他会无视将军们的明智建议，即便他们给了他好的忠告。就这样，在疯狂中，加上瓦尔基里行动的失败——那本是一次暗杀企图——他最终将德国推向了深渊，直到他自己开枪结束了自己的生命。听起来是不是很耳熟？"

Sanderson wasn't aware that his explosive handiwork was in the process of being dismantled, as teams of bomb experts defused his detonators one by one after they found them with their bomb-sniffing dogs. Instead he was assigned in another team, as they went hunting down Misato and Makoto, but were having a hard time finding those two. Like the others, this team was fully armed with submachine guns and wore vests and fatigues.  
桑德森并不知道他的爆炸装置正在被拆除，因为炸弹专家团队在他们的炸弹嗅探犬的帮助下，一个接一个地拆除了他的引爆器。相反，他被分配到另一个小组，他们正在追捕美里和真琴，但很难找到那两个人。与其他人一样，这个团队全副武装，手持冲锋枪，身穿背心和迷彩服。

"Level 9 clear," the team leader spoke into his handheld radio. There was no sign of Katsuragi within this level in the Geofront, and besides, where they should be going?  
"第 9 层已清空，" 团队领导对着手持无线电说道。在这个地底前线区域内，没有发现葛城美里的踪迹，而且，他们应该去哪里呢？

Now Sanderson had an idea.  
现在，桑德森有了一个主意。

"Say," he said. "Why don't we check out the emergency routes at Level 6?"  
"我说，"他提议道，"我们为什么不检查一下六层的紧急通道呢？"

"Sure," the other agent agreed. "We haven't covered that yet."  
"当然，"另一位特工同意道，"我们还没去过那里。"

As they hopped into the elevator, another younger agent said in an accent coming from upstate New York, "I don't understand why she would be involved in this conspiracy. All I know is that she's the best Eva operations chief there is; I personally met her, and she didn't do anything wrong."  
当他们跳进电梯时，另一位来自纽约上州的年轻特工带着口音说：“我不明白她为什么会卷入这个阴谋。我只知道她是最好的 Eva 行动主管；我亲自见过她，她没有做错任何事。”

"Shut your trap, Kiley," the team leader chided sharply, his near-perfect English colored by his past in Osaka. "We're just following orders, fanboy. Otherwise your mouth might get your ass in trouble."  
“闭嘴，凯莉，”队长严厉地责备道，他的英语近乎完美，却带着大阪的过去。“我们只是在执行命令，粉丝小子。否则你的嘴巴可能会给你惹麻烦。”

The mole shook his head. _You guys don't quite know what you're really looking for._  
内鬼摇了摇头。你们不太清楚自己真正在找什么。

Both Natsumi and Tsutomo were sleeping on the bed, naked beneath the sheets, their clothes scattered around the floor when he heard a loud knocking on the door. Blinking his eyes, he slowly parted the sheets, picked up his pants and pulled them up to the waist, before he instinctively sought for his service pistol in his jacket, which was also on the floor.  
夏美和津友都躺在床上，赤裸地裹在床单下，衣服散落一地，这时他听到了一阵急促的敲门声。他眨了眨眼，慢慢掀开床单，捡起裤子拉到腰间，然后本能地在夹克里寻找他的警用手枪，夹克也丢在地上。

_Ah, shit, I forgot,_ he cursed himself to find his jacket empty, as the knocking progressively became louder. _I've left it in my crib._  
该死，我忘了，"他咒骂着自己，发现夹克里空空如也，敲门声越来越响。"我把它落在床上了。

Instead, needing for a ready weapon, Tsutomo went to the kitchen and found a saucepan, hefted it in his hand and then walked over to the door, anticipating anything hostile, before he peered into the peephole.  
津友转而急需一件趁手的武器，他走进厨房，找到一个平底锅，掂量了一下，然后走向门口，警惕着任何可能的威胁，透过猫眼往外看。

"Who is it?" he questioned.  
“是谁？”他问道。

"It's us, Tomo," Misato replied. "It's an emergency!"  
“是我们，Tomo，”Misato 回答，“有紧急情况！”

Tsutomo let out a sigh of relief, and then he opened the door, letting the quartet in.  
Tsutomo 松了一口气，然后打开门，让四人进来。

"Thank goodness… What brings you guys here in this ungodly hour?" he questioned as they sat down on the sofa and the easy chairs in the living room, before he turned on the lights.  
"谢天谢地……你们这帮家伙在这种鬼时间来这儿干嘛？" 他问道，在他们坐到客厅的沙发和安乐椅上后，他打开了灯。

"Fuyutsuki and the others are in trouble," Misato said. "They're jailed in the Stockade."  
"冬月和其他人遇到了麻烦，" 美里说，"他们被关在要塞里了。"

"What?" Tsutomo blurted in shock. "How the hell that happened?"  
"什么？" 筒友震惊地脱口而出，"这他妈是怎么回事？"

"That's not all," Makoto added. "Ayanami and Nagisa were taken away on Ikari's orders. He did all of that simply to get anyone who opposed him out of the way, and at the same time keep those two Children under his thumb."  
"不仅如此，" 真琴补充道。"绫波和渚被碇的命令带走了。他这么做只是为了清除任何反对他的人，同时将那两个孩子置于他的掌控之下。"

Tsutomo hissed through his teeth. "Shit, that's unbelievable," he cursed. "Talk about an preemptive strike... So what about you guys?"  
堤文咬牙切齿地说："该死，真是难以置信，"他咒骂道。"这简直就是先发制人...那你们呢？"

"We're marked, I'm afraid," Misato said. "We managed to sneak in, though. We came here so that we could break them out of jail, and if possible, pull the tables on Ikari and avert a possible disaster."  
"恐怕我们也被盯上了，"美里说。"不过我们还是设法潜入了。我们来这里是为了把他们从监狱里救出来，如果可能的话，还要扭转局势，阻止碇引发可能的灾难。"

Tsutomo blinked. "Do you have a plan?"  
筒本眨了眨眼。“你有计划吗？”

"Yeah," Misato answered. "Call up anyone you trust, and then…" Now she saw Natsumi come out of the bedroom, dressed in a tank-top and a pair of denim shorts. She looked worried.  
“嗯，”美里回答。“打电话给你信任的任何人，然后……”这时她看到夏美从卧室出来，穿着背心和一条牛仔短裤。她看起来很担心。

"What's going on?" Natsumi asked as she sat down on the ottoman. "I mean, Fuyutsuki's been arrested?"  
“发生什么事了？”夏美坐在脚凳上问道。“我是说，冬月被逮捕了？”

Misato told her the whole story.  
美里向她讲述了整个故事。

"Good Christ," Natsumi exclaimed afterwards. "So, now that you're crazy to pull off a jailbreak, where do we figure in your gameplan?"  
"天哪，"夏美随后惊呼。"所以，既然你疯了似的要越狱，我们在你的计划中扮演什么角色？"

"Okay," Misato said. "Tomo's gonna have to bring enough trusted guys with muscle to help us out, to disarm or fool any opposition we encounter, while you… Do you still have authorization to use the MAGI under administrator mode?"  
"好吧，"美里说。"智需要带上足够可靠且有武力的人来帮我们，解除或迷惑我们遇到的任何阻力，而你……你还有使用管理员模式下 MAGI 的授权吗？"

"Yeah," Natsumi answered. "Well, the sysadmins forgot to change my user permissions after Akagi was reinstated, which is a very good thing. So what do you want me to do?"  
“嗯，”夏美回答，“系统管理员在赤城复职后忘了更改我的用户权限，这真是太好了。那么，你希望我做什么？”

"Simple: play merry havoc with the surveillance systems in that level where it contains the Stockade. Make it look like there's a glitch in the system, to buy us some time, to distract them, and to cover our tracks."  
“简单：在关押斯托克德的那一层，对监控系统大闹一番。让系统看起来像是出了故障，为我们争取时间，分散他们的注意力，并掩盖我们的行踪。”

Natsumi and Tsutomo nodded in unison. "Sounds like a great plan," Tsutomo agreed. "What else?"  
夏美和津友默契地点头。“听起来是个好计划，”津友赞同道，“还有呢？”

"After that," Misato said, "we have to break into the Angel Containment Facility, and I think they're holding Kaworu and Rei in there. I need Kaworu because of his scheme he came up with."  
"在那之后，" 美里说道，"我们必须闯入天使收容设施，我想他们把渚薰和绫波关在那里。我需要渚薰，因为他想出了一个计划。"

"How?" Natsumi asked, before Misato told them all what Kaworu wanted her to do, a plan that was worthy of _Ocean's Eleven_.  
"怎么做？" 夏美问道，随后美里向他们详细说明了渚薰的计划，一个堪比《十一罗汉》的精妙计划。"

"So again, Natsumi," Misato said afterwards, the whole scheme leaving them in awe. "I'm sure you also have the necessary clearances."  
"所以再次确认，夏美，" 美里接着说，整个计划让他们惊叹不已。"我相信你也具备必要的权限。"

"Damn, I forgot," Natsumi replied. "You're right. No changes in that, either. All access in all areas, and no restrictions."  
"该死，我忘了，" 夏美回答道。"你说得对。这一点也没变。所有区域的全部权限，没有任何限制。"

Misato chuckled and spoke, "I think we do have Lady Luck on our side, right?"  
美里轻声笑道，"我觉得我们确实有幸运女神的眷顾，对吧？"

"Sure is," Tsutomo said. "By the way, before we get ready to go… do you guys need some iced coffee… Or _Morning Rescue_?" he suggested, speaking of the famed orange-like drink that was said to bring overnight drunks back to functionality by dawn.  
"确实如此，" 筒本说。"对了，在我们准备出发之前…你们需要一些冰咖啡…还是‘晨间救援’？" 他提到的是那种据说能让宿醉者在黎明前恢复功能的著名橙色饮料。

The mere mention of Morning Rescue caused them to burst into laughter, generally because of its wacky TV ads.  
仅仅提到‘晨间救援’就让他们爆发出笑声，多半是因为那些古怪的电视广告。

---

Five minutes later they were heading back to HQ on the Humvee, with Paul behind the wheel, and with both Natsumi and Tsutomo fully-dressed. But halfway there they saw a dozen men waiting by the roadside curb with their own Humvee parked and idling, prompting Paul to step on the brakes.  
五分钟后，他们乘坐悍马车返回总部，保罗负责驾驶，奈津美和堤摩都已穿戴整齐。但半路上，他们看到路边有十几个人等候，旁边停着一辆正在怠速的悍马车，保罗见状踩下了刹车。

"That you guys?" Tsutomo called out from the passenger-side window of the vehicle. He squinted and recognized Shinichi Morisato, who walked close with a bundle in his right hand. They were wearing regulation BDUs and bulletproof vests, and this was Tsutomo's SRT unit, as he was their team leader.  
“是你们吗？”堤摩从车辆的副驾驶侧窗喊道。他眯起眼睛，认出了走近的森里一，对方右手拿着一捆东西。他们都穿着制式 BDU 和防弹背心，这是堤摩的 SRT 小队，他是他们的队长。

"Yeah," Shinichi said. "Thanks for the call, now we got a clear picture of what's going on. Speaking of Morrissey, we don't like that fucking opportunistic bastard."  
"嗯，" 新一说。"谢谢你的电话，现在我们对情况有了清晰的了解。说到莫里森，我们不喜欢那个该死的投机混蛋。"

Before they left, Tsutomo made a call to Shinichi and told him the story, and in return the younger agent spoke as to how and why Fuyutsuki was arrested, before Tsutomo told him the hard facts.  
在他们离开之前，筒本给新一打了个电话，向他讲述了整个故事，作为回报，这位年轻的特工解释了冬月被捕的原因和方式，随后筒本告诉了他一些难以接受的事实。

"I see," Tsutomo approved. "I thought you'll just follow along."  
"我明白了，" 筒本赞同道。"我以为你会只是随波逐流。"

"I believe in the Sub-Commander," Shinichi added. "He's still a good guy in my book, and so is our Chief. Personally, I suspected the Commander being nuts for some time, but now… thanks to you I was right."  
"我相信副指挥官，" 进一补充道。"在我看来，他依然是个好人，我们的局长也是。我个人早就怀疑指挥官有点不正常，但现在……多亏了你，我猜对了。"

"You got anything?" "你有什么吗？"

Shinichi said, "Yeah, we have the works, and we even have some stunners, flash-bangs, smoke and teargas, and since you asked me for it, I have this spare gun." He promptly handed over an H&K USP 45 pistol to Tsutomo, along with its body harness and three additional magazines.  
进一说："是的，我们装备齐全，甚至还有一些震撼弹、闪光弹、烟雾弹和催泪瓦斯，既然你向我要求了，我还有这把备用枪。" 他迅速递给堤文一把 H&K USP 45 手枪，连同其背带和三个额外的弹匣。

Tsutomo grinned back as he wore the harness. "Thanks, and okay, let's roll and move out," he ordered.  
筒友笑着回应，一边穿上马具。“谢谢，好了，我们出发吧，”他命令道。

---

Kaworu slowly blinked, completely dazed and wondering where he now wounded up in. The last thing he remembered was a soldier firing a dart, hitting him squarely in the chest, and they simply watched him fall down.  
渚慢慢地眨了眨眼，完全茫然不知所措，不知道自己现在身处何地。他最后记得的是一名士兵发射了飞镖，正中他的胸膛，然后他们就看着他倒下了。

Now…

_Where am I?_

Once more Kaworu blinked again, his eyes adjusting to the harsh new light, until he realized he was now in a prison.  
渚再次眨眼，眼睛适应着刺眼的新光线，直到他意识到自己现在身处监狱之中。

He shook his head, and then his eyes took in the surroundings: a spherical prison, eight rotating columns, a Plexiglas cube, straps holding him to the chair, an IV drip stuck to his vein, and to add insult to injury, he was suddenly overwhelmed by an excruciating headache.  
他摇了摇头，目光扫过四周：一个球形监狱，八根旋转的柱子，一个有机玻璃立方体，皮带将他固定在椅子上，静脉里插着点滴，更糟糕的是，他突然感到一阵剧烈的头痛。

The pain caused Kaworu to grit his teeth, and his tortured mind tried to figure out the source of the searing pain while trying not to scream.  
疼痛让渚薰咬紧牙关，他痛苦的大脑试图找出剧痛的源头，同时努力不让自己尖叫出来。

It wasn't whatever chemicals was being fed into his bloodstream, or the aftereffects of the tranquilizer, but it became clear to him that those columns were radiating a form of energy that seemed to be eating into his ability to generate an AT-Field.  
这并非是注入血液的化学物质所致，也不是镇静剂的后遗症，但他逐渐明白那些柱子正在释放一种能量，似乎在侵蚀他生成 AT 力场的能力。

But the pain only magnified his fury and the desire to squelch the pain altogether, thus Kaworu defied the pain by using his training to "divert" it to another faculty of his brain, and then he built up his willpower to escape by driving up the strength of his AT-Field to overwhelm the destructive effect of the columns.  
然而，疼痛非但没有平息他的怒火，反而加剧了他彻底消除痛苦的渴望。因此，渚薰通过运用自己的训练，将疼痛“转移”到大脑的另一个区域，随后他增强意志力，通过提升 AT 力场的强度来压倒柱子的破坏效应，从而逃脱。

And the clear plastic cube began to shake.  
透明的塑料立方体开始摇晃。

---

The guys running the Stockade were surprised when they saw Tsutomo – now fully dressed in combat gear – and his team coming right at them, with Misato and Makoto in handcuffs, as they entered the reception room. Promptly the Stockade supervisor saluted him.  
当看到筒本——现在已全副武装——和他的团队径直向他们走来，手中还带着被手铐铐住的美里和真琴时，负责管理拘留所的人员感到惊讶。他们一进入接待室，拘留所的负责人立刻向他敬礼。

"We caught them as they were trying to sneak their way back here," Tsutomo reported, with Shinichi nodding.  
"我们抓住了他们，正试图偷偷溜回来，"筒友报告道，新一在一旁点头。

"I see," the staff sergeant in charge of the Stockade said, as he pulled out a clipboard for the agent to sign, hoping he would make a more detailed report later on, but without warning Tsutomo and his men drew out their guns and pointed them at the surprised guards, who immediately held their hands up.  
"明白了，"负责看守所的士官长说着，掏出一份文件夹让特工签字，希望他稍后能做出更详细的报告，但没等反应过来，筒友和他的手下已经拔枪指向了惊愕的守卫们，后者立刻举起了双手。

"Don't try to call, don't press the panic button," Tsutomo warned them calmly, his pistol a few centimeters away from the head jailor's forehead. "Drop your weapons and we'll be fine, okay?"  
"别试图呼叫，别按警报按钮，"筒友平静地警告他们，手枪离典狱长的额头只有几厘米。"放下武器，我们就相安无事，好吗？"

The guards could only blink as they nodded in obedience, dropping and kicking away their pistols on the floor towards the team, who then removed the magazines and gathered them all into a duffel bag.  
卫兵们只能眨眼表示服从，纷纷将手中的枪支扔到地上并踢向队伍，随后队伍成员卸下弹匣，将所有武器收集到一个运动包中。

"Now open them up," Tsutomo ordered, watching another disarmed guard scurry to the cells along with three of Tsutomo's men, before he radioed Natsumi, who was in a lounge about a hundred meters away from them, sitting before a bank of vending machines.  
“现在打开它们，”筒友命令道，看着另一名被缴械的卫兵匆忙与筒友的三名手下一起前往牢房，随后他通过无线电联系了在一百米外休息室内的夏美，她正坐在一排自动售货机前。

"How's it going?" he asked through his throat mike.  
“进展如何？”他通过喉麦问道。

"The surveillance cameras are now locked to loop," she said, meaning to say Natsumi, using Misato's laptop, accessed the MAGI and tapped into the surveillance camera system, cut out a portion of video and then played it back to the recording subsystem and the camera feeds; anyone watching the footage in real time or in recording will get a seemingly peaceful scene from the cameras.  
"监控摄像头现在已经锁定为循环播放，"她解释道，意指夏美利用美里笔记本电脑，访问了 MAGI 系统并接入监控摄像头系统，截取了一段视频然后回放给录制子系统和摄像头信号；任何实时观看或查看录像的人都会看到摄像头传来的看似平静的画面。

"Very good," Tsutomo said, as he watched Fuyutsuki and the rest walk out of the cells, glad to be finally free, and the sight alone allowed him to sigh in relief and salute the old man. "Good morning, sir."  
"非常好，"堤文雄说道，他看着冬月和其他人走出牢房，终于重获自由，光是这一幕就让他松了一口气，并向老人敬礼。"早上好，长官。"

"Thank you, Captain," Fuyutsuki said, saluting back.  
"谢谢你，上尉，"冬月回礼道。

"Well, done, son," Hamamoto congratulated. "After all this time, I knew I could trust you."  
"干得好，儿子，" 滨本先生赞许道，"毕竟这么久了，我知道我可以信任你。"

Tsutomo nodded. "It's my pleasure, sir."  
堤文雄点头，"这是我的荣幸，先生。"

"We don't have much time," Misato said as Shinichi took away the handcuffs from her wrist, before doing the same to Makoto. The other team members tied up the hapless guards with duct tape, binding their legs and wrists.  
"我们时间不多，" 美里说道，与此同时新一解开了她手腕上的手铐，接着又为诚人解开。其他队员用胶带将那些倒霉的守卫的腿和手腕紧紧捆绑起来。

"Now what we're going to do next?" the old man asked with concern. "I'm sure Ikari will later have Nagisa killed to fulfill the prophecy."  
"接下来我们该怎么办？" 老人担忧地问道。"我敢肯定，碇会为了完成预言而杀害渚。"

"Me, Natsumi, Trudy, Paul and the rest of my team will have to get Nagisa and Ayanami free," Tsutomo said. "Shin, Makoto and Misato will have to find you and everyone else a place to hide in until the heat is off."  
"我、夏美、特鲁迪、保罗和我的团队必须救出渚和绫波，" 筒本说。"真、诚和美里得为你们和其他人找到一个藏身之处，直到风头过去。"

"Okay," Fuyutsuki agreed. "What about the other two Children?" he asked, referring to Asuka and Shinji.  
"好的，" 冬月同意道。"那另外两个孩子呢？" 他指的是明日香和真嗣。

"We'll get them, but once we're safe… I'll have to tell them the truth," Misato said. "But as for Commander Ikari…"  
"我们会抓住他们的，但一旦我们安全了……我必须告诉他们真相，"美里说。"但至于碇司令……"

"Today will be his undoing," Fuyutsuki said. "As much as I was his friend and confidant for a very long time, all of you will have to stop him, for he has crossed the line and gone too far."  
"今天将是他的终结，"冬月说。"尽管我曾是他多年的朋友和知己，但你们所有人都必须阻止他，因为他已经越界，走得太远了。"

Misato and Tsutomo blinked, as it was clear that Fuyutsuki has finally decided Ikari's fate.  
美里和堤摩都眨了眨眼，显然冬月已经决定了碇的命运。

Fuyutsuki added, "We cannot afford to let the world and of humanity slip into total destruction."  
冬月补充道：“我们不能让世界和人类陷入彻底的毁灭。”

---

By then, Kaworu's cubic prison was vibrating heavily, as though a heavy metal band was blasting away with nuclear amplifiers and speakers at full power. His hands formed tightly into fists, his whole body straining against the straps that held him down.  
那时，渚薰的立方体牢笼剧烈震动，仿佛一支重金属乐队正用核能放大器和扬声器全力轰鸣。他的双手紧握成拳，全身奋力抵抗着束缚他的带子。

His face, normally serene and radiated confidence, was now distorted into burning wrath as he concentrated more of his will, and whatever calories he had were burned quickly to fuel his AT-Field.  
他那平日里平静自信的面容，此刻因集中更多意志而扭曲成燃烧的愤怒，体内的热量迅速燃烧以供给他的 AT 力场。

Defying matter completely, Kaworu broke through the restraints and rose from his seat, before he unleashed his AT-Field with a high-pressure shockwave, as though a high-explosive bomb, shattering the cube, bent the columns hard and away from him like plastic straws, and blew out the meter-thick steel door into the hallway.  
完全无视物质束缚，渚薰挣脱了限制器，从座位上站起，随后释放出高压冲击波的 AT 力场，宛如一颗高爆炸弹，粉碎了立方体，将柱子硬生生弯曲如同塑料吸管，并将一米厚的钢门炸飞到走廊中。

---

"What the hell's going on? What's that explosion? CALL FOR HELP!" the lead technician roared while another picked up the phone but found it disconnected. They were surprised out of their wits when Kaworu "dropped" the psychic "bomb", and now their ears were overwhelmed by the klaxons and the control room was bathed in red light.  
“到底发生了什么？那爆炸是怎么回事？快呼叫支援！”领头技术员咆哮着，而另一人拿起电话却发现已经断线。当渚薰释放出心灵“炸弹”时，他们惊得魂飞魄散，现在耳朵被警报声淹没，控制室被红光笼罩。

"Phone's out! I can't even get the alarm button working!" the second technician yelled, banging the receiver on the console.  
“电话不通！连警报按钮都按不了！”第二名技术员喊道，用力敲打着控制台上的听筒。

"WHAT?" he shouted back while frantically typing commands on the keyboard.  
"什么？" 他回头大喊，同时疯狂地在键盘上输入指令。

"Hey, look at that!" the third technician chimed, pointing at one of the monitors.  
"嘿，看那个！" 第三位技术员插话道，指向其中一个显示器。

They couldn't see anything on that screen, which showed the hallway engulfed in choking thick dust, before they saw a silhouette walking through it until the figure emerged from the cloud.  
他们无法看清屏幕上的任何东西，那屏幕显示着走廊被呛人的厚厚尘埃吞没，直到一个身影从中穿过，从尘埃中显现出来。

For a moment Kaworu, now exuding a glowing aura, stared at the camera attached above the control room door. He was breathing heavily, his cerise eyes boring into the camera, declaring his liberation. He then simply balled his hand into a fist, and the camera was instantly crumpled into bits. The monitors now showed them static.  
一时间，浑身散发着光芒的渚薰凝视着控制室门上的摄像头。他呼吸急促，那双紫红色的眼睛直勾勾地盯着摄像头，宣告着自己的解放。随后，他只是简单地将手握成拳，摄像头便瞬间被捏成了碎片。现在，监视器上只剩下一片雪花。

Now terrified by Kaworu's newly-revealed power, as well as completely blinded, the technicians couldn't leave the safety of the control room.  
此刻，技术人员们被渚薰新展现的力量吓得魂飞魄散，又因完全失明而无法离开控制室的安全地带。

---

As the PA system called out a general alert, Kaworu stood before the chamber door, thick and heavy, and once more his mind felt out for the pins, screws, gears and pistons that held the door in place, He walked closer to touch the door with the palm of his hand, and then he could hear the lock mechanism click in place as it opened the door.  
当广播系统发出全面警报时，渚薰站在那扇厚重的大门前，再次用心灵感应探查着固定门板的销钉、螺丝、齿轮和活塞。他走近大门，用手掌触碰，随即听到锁机制咔嗒一声，门应声而开。

The Fifth Children stepped away to stand clear for the huge door as it swung out on its hinges, before he entered the chamber.  
第五适格者退开几步，为那扇巨大的门在铰链上摆动腾出空间，随后他走进了房间。

He found Rei unconscious and strapped to the chair, but the hex columns were dead, the electricity supplying them was cut off. With great care Kaworu pulled out the catheter, took off the straps that held Rei down, and with sufficient strength left he carried the girl onto his arms.  
他发现丽昏迷不醒，被绑在椅子上，但六边形柱子已经失效，供给它们的电力被切断了。卡洛小心翼翼地拔出导管，解开束缚丽的安全带，凭借剩余的力气将女孩抱在怀里。

Walking out of the ACF, and with klaxons blaring all around him, Kaworu was deep in his thoughts as he glanced at Rei's face, oblivious to the unfolding chaos.  
卡洛走出 ACF，警报声在他周围响彻云霄，他沉浸在自己的思绪中，瞥了一眼丽的脸庞，对正在发生的混乱浑然不觉。

_Your father and my creator has left me no choice except to set my plan in motion,_ he reflected. _Forgive me for doing this, my brother, for every beginning… there must also be an end._  
你的父亲，也是我的创造者，让我别无选择，只能启动我的计划，他思忖着。原谅我这样做，我的兄弟，因为每一个开始……也必须有一个结束。

Kaworu sighed with regret.  
渚薰遗憾地叹了口气。

_And now,_ _as with me, the rest of you will have roles to act on. After all, the world's a stage and we're all players._  
而现在，正如我一样，你们其余人也将在其中扮演各自的角色。毕竟，世界是个舞台，我们都是演员。

---

The tremor caught everyone off-guard in the Stockade, just as they were ready to leave, before the alarms exploded noisily and the PA system announced a general emergency.  
震动突如其来，拘留所里的每个人都措手不及，正当他们准备离开时，警报声轰然炸响，广播系统宣布进入全面紧急状态。

"Natsumi, what's going on out there?" Tsutomo asked, using the two-way radio again.  
“夏美，外面发生了什么？”堤人再次使用双向无线电问道。

"Something blew up at the ACF," Natsumi replied. "The video feed's dead, so no visual, but the operable sensors have detected his AT-Field right now!"  
“ACF 那边发生了爆炸，”夏美回答，“视频信号断了，没有画面，但可用的传感器现在检测到了他的 AT 力场！”

Tsutomo, Misato and everyone else were surprised. "What 'him'? You mean Kaworu?" he questioned.  
津友、美里和其他人都感到惊讶。“什么‘他’？你是说薰吗？”他问道。

"Yeah, I think they finally broke out, so I'm sure those guys at the ACF must be scared shitless by now."  
“是啊，我想他们终于逃出来了，所以我现在肯定 ACF 的那些家伙肯定吓得魂飞魄散了。”

They had little to say for the moment, as it was clear that the two Children were getting away, but to where?  
他们一时无话可说，因为很明显，那两个孩子正在逃走，但会逃到哪里去呢？

"You better come here, while we have to track them down," Tsutomo said.  
"你最好过来，我们得找到他们，"筒本说。

"Roger that!" Natsumi answered, before letting go of the "send" button on her radio.  
"收到！"夏美回答，然后松开了她无线电上的“发送”按钮。

Tsutomo then turned his attention to Misato and Fuyutsuki, and said, "Sir, I think you have the option to decide that boy's fate."  
筒本随后转向美里和冬月，说道："长官，我认为您有权决定那个男孩的命运。"

"I'm not a god, Captain," Fuyutsuki objected. "I find it distasteful to hold the power of life and death."  
"我不是神，舰长，" 冬月反对道，"我厌恶掌握生杀大权。"

"But we're not sure if he's still on our side," Tsutomo pleaded. "It brings us no other choice than to kill him. I'm sorry, sir, but it must be done because, who knows, it turns out he's about to do what his masters asked him to do."  
"但我们不确定他是否还站在我们这边，" 堤文请求道，"除了杀他，我们别无选择。对不起，先生，但这必须执行，因为谁知道呢，他可能正准备完成他的主子交给他的任务。"

For a few seconds Fuyutsuki grimly mulled over that option, before he said, "The decision falls on Shinji to _kill him_."  
冬月阴沉地思考了几秒钟，然后说："决定权在真嗣，让他来杀他。"

Tsutomo blinked. "That's it, sir?"  
Tsutomo 眨了眨眼。“就这样，长官？”

Fuyutsuki nodded before he turned his attention to Misato. "You'll have to get them ready, Colonel."  
Fuyutsuki 点了点头，然后将注意力转向 Misato。“你得让他们准备好，上校。”

At first, misato shook her head, but then saluted. "Yes, sir," she said, sadness tinged in her voice, before running off with Makoto, on their way to the BOQ.  
起初，Misato 摇了摇头，但随即敬了个礼。“是，长官，”她答道，声音中带着一丝悲伤，然后与 Makoto 一起跑向 BOQ。

---

At the same time, Shinji and Asuka were both awakened by the cacophony, prompting them to get out of bed and take a peek outside, wondering what was going on.  
与此同时，真嗣和明日香都被这嘈杂声吵醒，促使他们起床向外张望，想知道发生了什么。

"An Angel attack?" Asuka questioned, blinking.  
“使徒来袭？”明日香眨着眼睛问道。

Shinji turned to her and stared with unsure eyes, for he realized what he could be up against in the coming minutes, and he also had an icy feeling in his veins. This worried Asuka, fearing that Shinji could be relapsing once again.  
真嗣转向她，眼神中带着不确定，因为他意识到接下来几分钟可能要面对什么，同时他感到一股冰冷的寒意在血管中蔓延。这让明日香担心，害怕真嗣会再次陷入困境。

"What's wrong? Why are you afraid?" Asuka demanded, shaking his shoulders.  
"怎么了？你为什么害怕？" 明日香质问道，摇晃着他的肩膀。

"No… It can't be," the young man whispered. "It can't be _now_."  
"不……不可能，" 年轻人低声说。"现在不可能。

---

The shock of the explosion also roused Gendo Ikari from his nap. He then got up from his bed, put on shoes and wore his glasses, before carefully stepping over books and other objects fallen from the shelves to fetch a can of coffee in the kitchenette. Half a minute later, the sirens wailed across the complex, and surely in no time they'll be summoning him to the command bridge, to witness the end of Kaworu Nagisa.  
爆炸的冲击波也惊醒了碇源堂。他从床上起身，穿上鞋子，戴上眼镜，然后小心翼翼地跨过从书架上掉落的书籍和其他物品，去厨房拿了一罐咖啡。半分钟后，警报声在整个设施内响起，很快他们就会召唤他到指挥桥，见证渚薰的终结。

_It's happening_ _now,_ he thought, clearly pleased as he opened the can, before the telephone rang. _Just as planned._  
现在正在发生，他想，显然很高兴地打开了罐子，就在电话响起之前。正如计划的那样。

**Author's Notes:** Sorry if I've been distracted as usual, but once again I delivered. Now for a few things:  
作者笔记：如果我一如既往地分心了，请见谅，但我又一次完成了。现在说几件事：

(1) Rei's dream was inspired by the Tanabata story (you can look it up on Wikipedia). (2) the design of the Angel Containment Facility was based on a scene in Rebuild 2.22, except for a few alterations of my own; (3) Kaworu's escape, as well as the Stockade jailbreak, were also inspired by scenes from the movies _The Hulk_ (the Ang Lee version) and, of course, _Avatar_.  
(1) 丽梦中的灵感来自七夕传说（你可以在维基百科上查找）。(2) 使徒收容设施的设计基于《序》2.22 中的一个场景，除了我自己的一些改动；(3) 渚薰的逃脱以及拘留所的越狱，同样受到了电影《绿巨人》（李安版）和《阿凡达》中的场景启发。

In the next chapter, and with three remaining before the end of this season, Shinji will soon be confronting Kaworu, as their actions will make the difference between salvation and annihilation.  
在下一章中，距离本季结束还有三章之际，真嗣即将面对渚薰，他们的行动将决定救赎与毁灭的命运。

As usual, I'm welcome for any comments or criticisms. Thank you and good morning.  
一如既往，欢迎任何评论或批评。谢谢，早上好。

### Chapter 38 The Breaking  
第三十八章 破碎

_It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.  
常言道，知己知彼，百战不殆；不知彼而知己，一胜一负；不知彼不知己，每战必殆。_

- Sun Tzu, ancient Chinese strategist

At the threshold of the door, Asuka held Shinji by the shoulders, worried that the young man was completely shaken and could be relapsing back to his former self. She could see his fear and disbelief in his eyes, and already one of his hands was shaking.  
在门口，明日香抓住真嗣的肩膀，担心这个年轻人完全崩溃，可能会回到过去的自己。她能从他的眼中看到恐惧和不相信，他的其中一只手已经在颤抖。

"What's wrong? Why are you afraid?" Asuka demanded, shaking his shoulders.  
“怎么了？你为什么害怕？”明日香追问着，摇晃他的肩膀。

Shinji couldn't speak at first, but then he took much willpower to answer the girl.  
真嗣一开始说不出话来，但随后他鼓起极大的意志力回答了女孩。

"No… It can't be," the young man whispered. "It can't be _now_."  
“不……这不可能，”年轻人低声说道，“现在不可能。”

Asuka was taken aback. "What do you mean? Why?" she asked aloud.  
明日香感到震惊。“你什么意思？为什么？”她大声问道。

Instead his mind was flashing back to every moment he had with Kaworu; every time they talked and he brought up the question of his background, the Fifth Children was trying to dodge the subject, preferring to use the story that he was brought up as an orphan to a professor, and then trained to become one of the Eva pilots.  
相反，他的思绪不断回溯到与渚薰共度的每一个瞬间；每当他们交谈，他提及渚薰的背景时，第五适格者总是试图回避这个话题，宁愿用自己是由一位教授抚养长大的孤儿，并被训练成为一名 Eva 驾驶员的故事来搪塞。

Kaworu was too good to be true, and too good to be better than any of them, and yet…  
渚薰好得令人难以置信，好得超越了他们中的任何一人，然而……

He then thought of the time they spent at the public baths, talking about morality and personal will and eventually his weaknesses.  
接着，他想起了他们在公共浴池共度的时光，谈论道德、个人意志，最终触及他的弱点。

"Is it true," Shinji said, "that you keep your friends close, and your enemies much closer?"  
"这是真的吗？" 真嗣说，"你把朋友放在身边，而把敌人放得更近？"

Asuka nodded. "Yes, that was said to be from Sun Tzu yet it's _not_, but why say about that? Where did you pick that up?"  
明日香点点头。"是的，虽然这被认为是孙子的名言但其实不是，但你为什么提起这个？你从哪儿听来的？"

"I heard about it somewhere… probably from some TV show, but I remember it now."  
"我在某个地方听到的……大概是从某个电视节目里，但我现在想起来了。"

"Why?" “为什么？”

Shinji sighed and he closed his eyes hard, as if anguished. "Kaworu was so close to us, right? Maybe too close that… God, I don't understand why," he whispered before staring right at Asuka. "Because I had this dream... No, it's really a nightmare of sorts."  
真嗣叹了口气，紧紧闭上眼睛，仿佛痛苦万分。“卡洛和我们的关系太近了，对吧？也许近得过头了……天啊，我不明白为什么，”他低声说着，目光直直地盯着明日香。“因为我做了个梦……不，更像是个噩梦。”

Asuka frowned, wondering what was wrong with him.  
明日香皱起眉头，不知道他怎么了。

"I dreamed that… I killed Kaworu," Shinji said, before he began to shed tears. "I killed him because he was an Angel."  
“我梦到……我杀了卡洛，”真嗣说道，泪水开始滑落。“我杀了他，因为他是个天使。”

Somewhere in the Geofront, Kaworu and Rei were in a large, dimly-lit and croweded storage room that apparently seen little human activity, as evidenced by stacks of boxes festooned with cobwebs.  
在 Geofront 的某个地方，渚薰和绫波零身处一个宽敞、昏暗且拥挤的储藏室，这里显然很少有人活动，从布满蛛网的成堆箱子就可以看出。

Rei was lying on the floor when Kaworu tapped her cheek repeatedly. It was more than a half-hour since they escaped the prison called the Angel Containment Facility.  
丽躺在地板上，渚薰不停地轻拍她的脸颊。自从他们逃离被称为天使收容设施的监狱已经过去半个多小时了。

"Wake up," Kaworu whispered, trying to bring her around.  
“醒醒，”渚薰低声说道，试图唤醒她。

The girl's eyelids fluttered at first, trying to squint as her eyes adjusted to the light.  
女孩的眼睑起初微微颤动，试图眯起眼睛以适应光线。

"Where am I?" Rei said in a low tone as Kaworu propped her up with his hands to her back to sit upright. She was still wearing the white shirt that she put on after they made love.  
"我在哪儿？" 丽低声说道，卡沃鲁用双手扶着她的背，帮助她坐直。她仍然穿着那件白色衬衫，那是他们做爱后她穿上的。

"I'm sorry but we have to hide," he said. "I managed to get ourselves out."  
"对不起，但我们必须躲起来，" 他说。"我设法让我们逃出来了。"

Rei blinked. "How?" she asked, but then quickly knew why. "You used your AT-Field."  
丽眨了眨眼。"怎么做到的？" 她问道，但随即明白了原因。"你用了你的 AT 力场。"

Kaworu rubbed his temples, as if to emphasize that he had a splitting headache. "Those poles nearly killed me," he said. "I mean, those rotating columns gave me a nasty headache."  
渚薰揉着太阳穴，仿佛在强调他正遭受着剧烈的头痛。“那些柱子差点要了我的命，”他说，“我是说，那些旋转的柱子让我头疼得厉害。”

"Those were Hex Columns."  
“那是六边形柱。”

Kaworu frowned as he sat down on the floor. "Hex Columns?"  
渚薰皱着眉头坐在地板上。“六边形柱？”

"Yes," Rei answered. "They were intended to neutralize any form or generation of the AT-Field."  
"是的，" 丽回答道。"它们旨在中和任何形式或产生的 AT 力场。"

"I see," Kaworu said, nodding. "Do you want some tea?" he offered, pointing at a dozen cans of tea just a foot away from them.  
"我明白了，" 渚薰点头说道。"你想喝点茶吗？" 他提议道，指着离他们仅一英尺远的十几罐茶。"

"Thank you," Rei answered, before he reached out to pick up and opened the can. He then gave the drink to her, and the can was still warm, having been purloined from a vending machine a few minutes ago.  
"谢谢，" 丽回答，然后伸手拿起并打开了一罐。他将饮料递给她，罐子还是温的，几分钟前刚从自动贩卖机里拿出来的。"

Only then Rei could now hear the distant screeching of the alarms. "What's happening?" she asked before drinking.  
只有这时，丽才能听到远处警报的尖锐声响。“发生了什么？”她喝之前问道。

"We tripped the alarms, I'm afraid," Kaworu said.  
“恐怕是我们触发了警报，”薰说。

"Before the Commander put me to sleep again," Rei said, nursing her drink, "I argued with him, told him that we'll be putting an end to his plan."  
“在指挥官再次让我入睡之前，”丽一边啜饮一边说，“我和他争论过，告诉他我们将终结他的计划。”

"And of the Committee," Kaworu added. "He's eagerly waiting for this to happen, so what did you say to him?"  
"还有委员会的那位，" 渚薰补充道。"他正热切期待着这一切发生，所以你对他怎么说？"

Rei looked at Kaworu. "I said he abused us, and by leaving him behind he gave Shinji much suffering and therefore my brother lost faith in him. I did not regret everything I threw back at him… But, what about you?" she asked, suddenly remembering Kaworu's fate.  
绫波看着渚薰。"我说他虐待我们，留下他让真嗣承受了太多痛苦，因此我哥哥对他失去了信任。我并不后悔我对他说的那些话……但，你呢？" 她突然想起了渚薰的命运。

"Now today's the time, I have my own plans," Kaworu said. "I'm hoping it's going to work for all of us."  
"今天就是时候了，我有自己的计划，" 渚薰说。"我希望这对我们所有人都有利。"

The First Children now looked concerned.  
初代孩子们现在看起来有些担忧。

"Don't worry much," Kaworu reassured her. "We need to move fast."  
"别太担心，"渚薰安慰她。"我们得快点行动。"

Rei slowly stood up. "Where to?"  
绫波慢慢站起身。"去哪儿？"

"To the launch cages."  
"前往发射笼。"

"I dreamed that I was piloting Eva, and I caught him," Shinji said to Asuka, as they sat on the bed. "He was in her hands, about to crush him, when he spoke of something yet I couldn't hear any words. I tried to talk, but it seems he couldn't hear either."  
"我梦到我在驾驶 Eva，我抓住了他，" 真嗣对明日香说，他们坐在床上。"他在她的手中，即将被捏碎，那时他说了些什么，但我听不见任何话语。我试图说话，但似乎他也听不见。"

"And then?" Asuka questioned.  
"然后呢？" 明日香问道。"

"Before I could react I watched Kaworu being crushed, and that's when I woke up to hear all this noise right now."  
"在我能反应过来之前，我眼睁睁看着渚薰被压碎，然后我就被这阵噪音吵醒了。"

"No," Asuka said. "You can make it _not_ happen."  
"不，" 明日香说。"你可以阻止它发生。"

Shinji was surprised at her change of heart. "Why?"  
真嗣对她的态度转变感到惊讶。"为什么？"

"I have much to owe him, even if… even if he could be our enemy. Maybe he's just bluffing and baiting your crazy father," Asuka said before letting out a sad chuckle. "Maybe he's testing you."  
"我欠他很多，即使……即使他可能是我们的敌人。也许他只是在虚张声势，引诱你那疯狂的父亲，" 明日香说着，发出了一声苦笑。"也许他是在考验你。"

"I'm not going to see him die this time," Shinji avowed but unexpectedly they saw Misato and her other companions, including Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, barge into the room, urgency marked on their faces.  
"这次我不会眼睁睁看着他死去，" 真嗣坚定地说，但出乎意料地，他们看到美里和她的其他同伴，包括副司令官冬月，急匆匆地闯进房间，脸上写满了紧迫。"

"Shinji!" Misato yelled. "Get yourself ready!"  
"真嗣！" 美里大喊。"快准备好！"

The young man stood up, and with his face marked in anger, he answered, "For what? To kill Kaworu? No!"  
"年轻人站起身，脸上带着愤怒的痕迹，他回答道：“为了什么？去杀渚薰？不！””

Without hesitation Misato spun Shinji around and pinned his back to the wall. "You will have to do it!"  
"美里毫不犹豫地将真嗣转过身来，将他的背抵在墙上。“你必须这么做！””

"I'm not!" Shinji retorted. "LET HIM LIVE!"  
"“我不会！”真嗣反驳道，“让他活下去！””

Angered, Misato slapped Shinji across the face, her audience aghast, and she angrily said, "Do you know what he's going to do? What if we're all wrong about our assumptions about Kaworu? What if he's going to do it for real? And how did you know he's an Angel?"  
愤怒之下，美里一巴掌扇在真嗣脸上，旁观者们目瞪口呆，她怒气冲冲地说：“你知道他要做什么吗？如果我们对渚薰的猜测全都是错的怎么办？如果他真的要那么做怎么办？你怎么知道他是使徒？”

Shinji was in a rage. "Because I dreamed that I killed him, that's why I don't want to, and I'm not going to follow Father's orders!"  
真嗣怒火中烧。“因为我梦到我杀了他，这就是为什么我不想这么做，也不会听从父亲的命令！”

"Forget your father, he's on left field, he started all this shit!" Misato objected. "What you have to do right now brings you and I without any other choice. If he comes in contact with Adam, then that's it, game's over and we're all dead!"  
“别管你父亲了，他完全偏离正轨，这一切都是他搞出来的！”美里反驳道，“你现在要做的事，是我们别无选择的。如果他和亚当接触，那就完了，游戏结束，我们都得死！”

With that last word striking him like a bomb, Shinji stopped struggling as everyone was nervously watching this tableau. He then managed a hard swallow; it was déjà vu to him, just like the first time he was asked to ride Unit-01 on his first day.  
随着那最后一句话如炸弹般击中他，真嗣停止了挣扎，所有人都紧张地注视着这一幕。他艰难地咽了口唾沫；这感觉似曾相识，就像他第一天被要求驾驶初号机时一样。

"I'm sorry if I have to tell this to you, and am bringing you hard," Misato said, "but even if he's our friend, you and Asuka will have to get him before he could do anything bad; you two are the only ones left to operate the Evas to deal with his AT-Field."  
“如果我必须告诉你这些，让你感到痛苦，我很抱歉，”美里说，“但即使他是我们的朋友，你和明日香也必须在他做出坏事之前阻止他；你们俩是唯一能操作 Eva 来对付他 AT 力场的人。”

"You mean he betrayed us?" Shinji asked.  
“你是说他背叛了我们？”真嗣问道。

Asuka looked distraught, and Misato didn't answer, as if suddenly having a fit of self-examination.  
明日香看起来心烦意乱，而美里没有回答，仿佛突然陷入了自我审视之中。

"Tell me," Shinji whispered. "What's going on? What's happening?"  
"告诉我，"真嗣低声说道。"发生了什么？正在发生什么？"

"You see… Your father caught them a few hours ago and put them in some chamber of sorts, and then arrested scores of others he thought were rebelling against him."  
"你知道……你父亲几个小时前抓住了他们，把他们关进了某种房间，然后逮捕了其他他认为在反抗他的人。"

Shinji blinked. "Who got arrested?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“谁被逮捕了？”

"The Sub-Commander, Director Hamamoto, Doctor Akagi and some others," Misato said, as Fuyutsuki, Ritsuko and Hamamoto acknowledged the fact with respective nods. "I was to be caught as well," she added, "but somehow we managed to sneak in and get them out, and just then we now have this red alert."  
“副司令、滨元主任、赤木博士还有其他人，”美里说道，同时福音津、律子和滨元各自点头确认。“我也差点被抓，”她补充道，“但不知怎么的，我们设法潜入并把他们救了出来，现在就遇到了这个红色警报。”

Misato relaxed her grip on Shinji's shoulder.  
美里放松了握在真嗣肩膀上的手。

"Look," she said. "I'm very concerned about you being hurt about the truth, but as I said before, we have no choice but to put him down. You have to set aside your sentimentality, and you also have to bring yourself to the reality of the situation we're facing."  
"听着，" 她说道，"我非常担心你会因为真相而受伤，但正如我之前所说，我们别无选择，只能让他安息。你必须抛开你的感伤，同时也要让自己面对我们当前所处的现实。"

"But…" Shinji trailed away.  
"但是…" 真嗣的声音渐渐低了下去。"

"There comes a time that you'll have to make decisions on your own," she said, "and this is the moment you have to confront it."  
"总有一天，你得自己做出决定，" 她说，"而现在，就是你面对这一刻的时候。"

"So I'm in the spotlight, right?"  
"所以我成了焦点，对吧？"

Asuka nodded, remembering the moment she told him that he was the center of all of this, and that everyone was counting on him.  
明日香点点头，回想起她告诉他这一切的中心是他，每个人都寄希望于他的那一刻。

Shinji shook his head, as though the burden of responsibility has ultimately fell upon his shoulder, and he sighed.  
真嗣摇了摇头，仿佛责任的重担最终落在了他的肩上，他叹了口气。

"Maybe I'll try to talk him out," Shinji said. "You know… it doesn't have to end like this, and I don't have to pilot Unit One."  
“也许我会试着说服他，”真嗣说，“你知道的……事情不必这样结束，我也不必驾驶初号机。”

"You can't underestimate him," Misato responded. "We've seen this too many times and sometimes you guys got creamed in the process, so we can't be naïve this time. Think about it."  
“你不能低估他，”美里回应道，“我们见过太多次这种情况，有时你们在过程中被打得很惨，所以我们这次不能天真。好好想想。”

A moment passed without any more words said, before Shinji nodded.  
片刻间无人再言语，随后真嗣点了点头。

"All right," he decided in a low voice. "I'm hurt, I'm sad, I'm angry, but you're right, I have no other option but to face him. However, should he dies in my hands, I'll remember for the rest of my life for what I did to him… but I'll never gain joy from it because I have to kill a friend... no, a brother."  
"好吧，"他低声决定道，"我受伤了，我难过了，我生气了，但你是对的，我没有其他选择，只能面对他。然而，如果他死在我手里，我会终生记得我对他所做的一切……但我永远不会因此感到快乐，因为我不得不杀了一个朋友……不，是一个兄弟。"

Slowly Misato wrapped Shinji in her arms' embrace and whispered, "You'll not be alone in deciding that; I'll be responsible for his fate as much as you are."  
慢慢地，美里将真嗣拥入怀中，低声说道："你不会独自做这个决定的；我和你一样，要对他的命运负责。"

Just then Misato's radio, attached to her waist with a clip, crackled to life. "Misato, do you copy?" Tsutomo asked. "We're now at the ACF."  
就在这时，美里腰间用夹子固定着的无线电突然响起。"美里，你听到了吗？"堤人问道，"我们现在在 ACF。"

The woman disengaged, took the radio and pressed the Talk button to speak. "Roger, I copy. What's up?"  
女人松开手，拿起无线电，按下通话键说道：“收到，明白。有什么情况？”

"Nagisa and Ayanami's gone," he said, "and it appears he managed to blow his way out, free the girl, and of course, we found the techs in the control room. They're scared shitless."  
“渚薰和绫波零不见了，”他说，“看来他设法炸开了出口，救出了女孩，当然，我们在控制室找到了技术人员。他们吓得魂不附体。”

"I see," Misato acknowledged. "Can you guys try to track them down?"  
“我明白了，”美里回应道，“你们能试着追踪他们吗？”

"Roger that, we'll do," Tsutomo said. "But we're not alone because the other security teams are scouring every floor, and those kids will be surely trying to dodge them."  
"收到，我们会行动，" 筒本说，"但我们并非孤军奋战，其他安保小组正在每一层搜查，那些孩子肯定会设法避开他们。"

"Anything else?" “还有别的吗？”

"Nope, but I'll try to keep you updated as we go."  
"没有，但我会尽量随时向你更新情况。"

"Thanks," Misato said before she clipped the radio back in and turned her attention back to Shinji and Asuka, who were still waiting for her word. "Have you guys made up your minds?"  
"谢谢，" 美里说完，将无线电重新固定好，转而看向真嗣和明日香，他们仍在等待她的指示。"你们决定好了吗？"

"We'll do it," Shinji answered, as Asuka agreed with a nod.  
“我们会做的，”真嗣回答道，而明日香点头表示同意。

Misato then turned to Fuyutsuki, Ritsuko and Hamamoto, and said, "The Children and I will go to the launch cages, while Morisato will get you all to safety, sir."  
美里随后转向冬月、律子和滨元，说道：“孩子们和我将前往发射笼，而森里则会带你们所有人到安全的地方，先生。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "It's your call, Colonel. Good luck."  
冬月点头。“由你决定，上校。祝你好运。”

"Thank you, sir," she said, before saluting and then they left.  
"谢谢您，先生，"她说完敬了个礼，随后他们便离开了。

Back at the SEELE staging area in Siberia, Keel and the rest of the Committee were monitoring events at their command center, after one of the operators reported a massive outburst of AT-Field energy, detected by a passing reconnaissance satellite's sensors some 15,000 kilometers above the surface of the Earth.  
回到西伯利亚的 SEELE 集结区，基尔和委员会的其他成员正在指挥中心监控事态发展。一名操作员报告称，一颗经过的侦察卫星传感器在地球表面上方约 15,000 公里的地方探测到了一次巨大的 AT 力场能量爆发。

"So it's happening," Evgenyi said to Keel as they watched operators scurry about, exchanging notes and figures, and some of their eyes glued to their monitors.  
"果然开始了，"叶甫根尼对基尔说，他们看着操作员们忙碌地来回奔走，交换着笔记和数据，有些人的目光紧盯着屏幕。

"Yes, according to plan," Keel answered, hands behind his back. He was also just as pleased as his archenemy. "Whatever he does, eventually we'll be getting the desired goal as we wanted, pieces falling into place."  
"是的，按计划进行，"基尔回答，双手背在身后。他和他的死对头一样感到满意。"无论他做什么，最终我们都会得到我们想要的，一切都在按部就班。"

"I wonder what Sanderson is doing right now," Evgenyi spoke, thinking of the mole. "I guess he'll be okay now with the heat off him, but this is also the right moment for him to cripple the base."  
"不知道桑德森现在在做什么，"叶夫根尼说道，想着那个内奸。"我想他现在应该没事了，压力已经减轻，但这也是他削弱基地的最佳时机。"

"He'll succeed," Keel said. "I'm sure he'll finish his mission objectives as ordered."  
"他会成功的，"基尔说。"我相信他会按照命令完成他的任务目标。"

"And what about the Second Children? He should not forget that, so why place so much faith in him?"  
"那么第二代孩子们呢？他不应该忘记这一点，为什么还要如此信任他？"

"A tenacious man he is, Sanderson will do whatever it takes to get close and kill her without hesitation, and I trust his judgment."  
"他是个坚韧的人，桑德森会不惜一切代价接近并毫不犹豫地杀死她，我相信他的判断。"

Evgenyi nodded in agreement.  
叶甫根尼点头表示同意。

---

At around the same moment Sanderson was on his own; he broke off from his group with an excuse that he had to return to get a forgotten piece of personal equipment.  
大约在同一时刻，桑德森独自一人；他找了个借口，说自己得回去取一件忘带的个人装备，从而脱离了他的小组。

With the chaos unfolding, Sanderson felt it was a good opportunity to bring out the detonator, yet as he stepped into the threshold of the Eva launch cages, and gazed at the giants sitting in vast quantities of water-based liquid coolant, he needed to do one more thing.  
在混乱爆发之际，桑德森觉得这是个拿出引爆器的好机会，然而当他踏入 Eva 发射笼的门槛，凝视着那些巨人浸泡在大量水基液体冷却剂中时，他还需要做一件事。

The mole whipped out his pistol from the holster and affixed a sound suppressor, before checking the weapon again, including the magazine, and then pulled the slide.  
这名间谍迅速从枪套中抽出手枪，并装上消音器，随后再次检查了武器，包括弹匣，然后拉动了滑套。

Satisfied with the functionality of both weapon and detonator, he'll have to wait by camping behind a stack of boxes.  
对武器和引爆器的功能感到满意后，他只能选择在箱子堆后露营等待。

---

Spurred by the red alert, security troopers were now everywhere, armed to the teeth, swarming every passageway and hall, searching every room and asking questions, demanding where the fugitives have gone.  
红色警报的刺激下，安全部队遍布各处，全副武装，涌入每条通道和大厅，搜查每个房间，询问问题，追问逃犯的下落。

In the Stockade, one team found the personnel hogtied, and when they took off the tape off the mouth of one of them, he babbled about Katsuragi and Kanzaki freeing the prisoners. The team leader radioed back to Morrissey, who then became infuriated. To add insult to injury, another team told him that Kaworu and Rei had escaped the ACF.  
在禁闭区，一支队伍发现人员被捆绑，当他们撕下其中一人嘴上的胶带时，他语无伦次地提到葛城和神崎释放了囚犯。队长向莫里西报告，后者随即暴怒。更糟的是，另一支队伍告诉他，渚薰和绫波已从 ACF 逃脱。

"Find them!" he ordered. "I also need a team to secure the Command Center!"  
"找到他们！" 他命令道。"我还需要一支队伍去确保指挥中心的安全！"

"Yes, we're dispatching another there, sir," the dispatcher said calmly, trying not to be fazed by the man's rage.  
"是的，我们正在那里派遣另一支队伍，长官，" 调度员平静地说道，试图不被那人的愤怒所影响。

---

Rei and Kaworu were running this time through the corridor, making their way to the launch cages, when they were surprised by a large contingent of troopers, who were just as astonished by their presence.  
这次，绫和卡沃鲁在走廊里奔跑，向发射舱前进，却意外地遇到了一大队士兵，这些士兵同样对他们出现在这里感到惊讶。

"It's them!" a lieutenant barked. "Stop those kids!"  
"是他们！" 一名中尉厉声喝道。"拦住那些孩子！"

Without hesitating, the platoon rushed towards them with truncheons, shields and stun guns, but Kaworu clenched his fists and said to Rei, "Go behind me!"  
毫不犹豫地，小队手持警棍、盾牌和电击枪冲向他们，但渚薰紧握双拳，对绫波说："躲到我身后！"

The girl obeyed, and then Kaworu unleashed an AT-Field shockwave which somehow slammed onto the soldiers' chests like being struck with a baseball bat, lifted them off their feet and sent them flying across the room, crashing into walls. Their weapons and helmets clattered on the floor as they slumped, barely conscious and moaning as the couple weaved around them.  
女孩听从了，随后渚薰释放出一股 AT 力场冲击波，仿佛被棒球棒击中般猛烈撞击士兵们的胸口，将他们掀翻在地，飞过房间，撞上墙壁。他们的武器和头盔叮当作响地落在地板上，士兵们瘫倒在地，意识模糊，呻吟着，而这对情侣则穿梭其间，避开了他们。

Kaworu looked up at the sign ahead of him; the launch cages were about 200 meters to the left.  
渚薰抬头看向前方的指示牌；发射笼大约在左边 200 米处。

"Let's go this way!" he exclaimed, pulling Rei with him by the wrist.  
“我们走这边！”他喊道，拉着绫波的手腕一起走。

Gendo arrived at the Command Center, unperturbed by the ongoing bedlam, which at the moment bridge staffers were frantically going to and fro, exchanging information, relaying bits and pieces of data, trying to coordinate security teams on the go.  
碇源堂到达指挥中心，对眼前的混乱毫不在意，此刻桥上的工作人员正疯狂地来回奔走，交换信息，传递数据片段，试图协调正在行动的安保团队。

"Sir," one of the operators at a nearby console said. "They've pinpointed Nagisa and Ayanami, heading towards the launch cages. Shall we lock down that sector?" He was referring to the eight-inch emergency lockdown doors that were used to close down areas to contain nuclear, biological and chemical outbreaks.  
“长官，”附近控制台的一名操作员说道，“他们已经锁定了渚和绫波的位置，正朝发射笼方向移动。我们是否对该区域进行封锁？”他指的是用于封闭区域以控制核、生、化泄漏的八英寸紧急封锁门。

"Do not deploy unless I say so," Gendo said as he stood behind the man's seat. "Let them. Tell those teams finding those Children not to interfere."  
“除非我下令，否则不要部署，”碇源堂站在那人座位后面说道，“让他们去吧。告诉那些找到孩子们的小组不要干涉。”

The operator was surprised. "But sir—"  
操作员感到惊讶。“但是，长官——”

Gendo upraised a finger. "I have a plan in mind for those two, but as for the fugitives, where they are?"  
源渡举起一根手指。“我心中已有对付那两人的计划，但至于逃犯们，他们在哪儿？”

"We've located Kanzaki and his team, and he's in pursuit, and already we've deployed two more teams to go after them. Yet we have lost track of Fuyutsuki and Katsuragi."  
“我们已经定位了神崎和他的团队，他正在追捕中，并且我们已经部署了另外两个团队去追捕他们。然而，我们失去了对冬月和葛城踪迹的追踪。”

"They should keep finding them," Gendo said. "Tell them not to shoot unless they're shot at, and they should know their rules of engagement, and who accessed the MAGI this time?" He was talking about the breach in the system in which the security subsystems were momentarily disabled to facilitate Fuyutsuki's escape.  
“他们应该继续寻找，”源渡说。“告诉他们除非被射击，否则不要开枪，他们应该知道他们的交战规则，以及这次是谁访问了 MAGI？”他指的是系统中的安全子系统被暂时禁用以方便冬月逃脱的漏洞。

"I'm sorry, sir, but Doctor Odani broke in and disabled the cameras and sensors," the operator answered.  
"对不起，先生，但 Odani 医生闯入并关闭了摄像头和传感器，"操作员回答道。

Gendo only managed a murmur.  
碇源堂只能发出一声低语。

"We've restored the security subsystems, though," the operator added to reassure him.  
"我们已经恢复了安全子系统，"操作员补充道，试图让他放心。

"Sir, I finally found Katsuragi and the two other Children," another operator chimed in, as he pressed the key to bring up one of the CCTV feeds on the main screen. "They're also heading to the launch cages."  
“长官，我终于找到了葛城和另外两个孩子，”另一名操作员插话道，他按下按键，将其中一个监控摄像头的画面调到了主屏幕上。“他们也正前往发射笼。”

"Again, do not let any team try to interfere them," Gendo ordered. "Tell Morrissey to double up their efforts to capture Fuyutsuki. We'll deal with Katsuragi afterwards."  
“再次强调，不要让任何队伍试图干扰他们，”碇源堂命令道。“告诉莫里西，让他们加倍努力抓捕冬月。我们稍后再处理葛城的事。”

Kaworu pressed a button to open the double doors to the launch cages, and the couple entered, stepping on the walkway that bridged over the immense tanks that held the Evas in place. They looked at both Eva units, unmoving amidst the klaxons and the repeated call of the PA system, before Kaworu turned to Rei, who looked doubtful.  
渚薰按下按钮，打开了通往发射笼的双重大门，两人步入其中，踏上了横跨在巨大储藏罐上的通道，这些储藏罐固定着 EVA 机体。他们注视着两台 EVA，在警报声和广播系统的重复呼叫中静止不动，随后渚薰转向了看起来有些疑虑的绫波。

"This is it," he said. "I know you don't want this to happen, and I tried as much as I could to stop it, yet…" He paused to sigh, and added, "I want you to understand that sometimes it's impossible to stop destiny from happening, and it's also impossible to have full control of people and situations. There comes a time that we can't fight the current, and we have to swim along the course instead."  
"就是这了，" 他说。"我知道你不想这事发生，我也尽了最大努力去阻止，然而……" 他停顿了一下，叹了口气，接着说，"我希望你能明白，有时候命运是无法阻挡的，而且我们也无法完全掌控人和事。总有些时候，我们无法逆流而上，只能顺其自然。"

Kaworu slowly held Rei by her shoulders. "If I remember well," she said, "you said it is impossible to stop this happening, but you could change the trajectory."  
渚薰缓缓地扶住绫波的肩膀。"如果我没记错，" 她说，"你说过阻止这事发生是不可能的，但你可以改变它的轨迹。"

"That's right," he agreed, and then let out a sober chuckle. "A prophecy can only happen if everything goes as planned, but even the smallest change in the elements involved can alter a plan's outcome."  
"没错，" 他同意道，随即发出一声沉重的轻笑。"一个预言只有在一切按计划进行时才会成真，但哪怕是最微小的变数，也能改变整个计划的结局。"

"What are you going to do now?" Rei asked as Kaworu pivoted to confront Unit-02, the four-eyed crimson-and-gold behemoth staring down on him, and much to the girl's surprise, Kaworu made two steps forward off the edge of the platform and levitated. He then closed his eyes, willed his mind to penetrate deep into the Eva's core and to "talk" with her soul.  
"你现在打算做什么？" 丽问道，看着渚转向面对二号机，那四眼的赤金巨兽正俯视着他，令女孩惊讶的是，渚向前迈了两步，离开了平台的边缘，悬浮了起来。随后他闭上眼睛，将自己的意识深入到 Eva 的核心，试图与她的灵魂"对话"。

"_What is the meaning of this?" Kyoko demanded, the woman surprised to see Kaworu again as she rose on her feet._  
"这是什么意思？" 京子质问道，她惊讶地看到渚再次出现，站起身来。

"_I need you for one last time," Kaworu said as he stood before her. "It's urgent."_  
"我需要你最后一次帮忙，" 渚站在她面前说道。"很紧急。"

"_But… You can't do this!" the woman objected, her arms and legs being pulled as if she was a marionette manipulated with strings by a puppeteer. "What are you going to do_ _to me?"_  
"但…你不能这样做！" 女人抗议道，她的四肢被拉扯，仿佛她是一个由提线操纵的木偶。"你要对我做什么？"

"_Don't get angry, I'm not going to have you hurt," Kaworu assured. "It's for a while, and then it's over."_  
"别生气，我不会让你受伤的，" 渚薰保证道。"只是暂时的，然后就结束了。"

_Kyoko yelled, "WHAT?" 绫子大喊："什么？"_

_Kaworu shook his head. "Trust me on this for now, Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu," he answered, "because someday your daughter and her boyfriend will understand the significance of my final task, so you'll have to go along with me."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“现在请相信我，绫波零·齐柏林·索留，”他回答道，“因为总有一天你的女儿和她的男朋友会明白我最后任务的意义，所以你得跟我一起。”_

"_You're crazy__!" Kyoko muttered._  
“你疯了！”绫波低声说道。

"_One man's craziness is another man's_ _courage," Kaworu replied. "I have to do this to test Shinji."_  
“一个人的疯狂是另一个人的勇气，”渚薰回答，“我必须这么做来考验真嗣。”

_Kyoko blinked twice, taken aback. "A test?"  
Kyoko 眨了眨眼，有些吃惊。“一个测试？”_

"_That's right, Doctor."_ “没错，博士。”

Just as they finally came into the sanctum sanctorum of the Evas, Misato, Shinji and Asuka were surprised to see Unit-02 breaking out of her cage, bending and snapping the restraints away from her, hoses and probes being pulled out, before rising from the vat of coolant by climbing up, getting a toehold on the cracks and crevices. Alongside with her was Kaworu, levitating hundreds of feet over their heads; Rei simply stood there on the walkway, watching as the technicians and mechanics came out of their sleeping quarters to see and be stupefied that one of their wards went out for a walk with only a Terminal Plug stuck into her.  
正当他们终于进入 EVA 的圣所时，Misato、Shinji 和 Asuka 惊讶地看到 2 号机挣脱了牢笼，弯曲并折断了束缚她的锁链，拔掉了软管和探针，然后攀爬着从冷却液池中站起，利用裂缝和凹槽稳住脚跟。与此同时，Kaworu 悬浮在他们头顶数百英尺的高空；Rei 则静静地站在走道上，看着技术人员和机械师们从宿舍里出来，目瞪口呆地发现他们的守护对象竟然只带着一个终端插头出去散步了。

"KAWORU NAGISA!" Misato yelled as she whipped out her pistol and aimed at him. "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? GET BACK HERE!"  
"渚薰！" 美里大喊着，迅速拔出手枪对准了他。"你他妈的在干什么？给我回来！"

"I can't! You can't shoot me either!" Kaworu answered back.  
"我不能！你也不能开枪打我！" 渚薰回答道。

Misato gritted her teeth; it was too late as the other Children watched both Eva and Angel motioned towards to an open shaft, before leaping in. She then turned to Shinji and ordered, "Go get him."  
美里咬紧牙关；一切都太迟了，其他孩子们看着 Eva 和使徒一起向一个敞开的井口移动，然后跳了进去。她随即转向真嗣，命令道："去把他带回来。"

"But…" Shinji mumbled, still in shock along with Asuka, who was astonished as a driver who'd just witnessed a carjack on her Ferrari.  
“但…” 真嗣咕哝着，和同样震惊的明日香一样，她就像一个刚目睹自己法拉利被劫持的司机一样目瞪口呆。

"Damn it," Misato snarled as she spun around. "You'd better get into the Eva and—"  
“该死，”美里咆哮着转过身来。“你最好赶紧进入 Eva——”

They heard the click of a pistol's hammer being pulled, and turned to see that Sanderson, standing behind Asuka, now has the muzzle of his suppressor touching the girl's right temple. The girl couldn't move an inch, knowing all too well that she's now a hostage, and if she tried to resist, he'll put her out with a nine-millimeter slug into her brain.  
他们听到手枪击锤被拉动的咔嗒声，转身看到桑德森站在明日香身后，现在他的消音器枪口正抵在女孩的右太阳穴上。女孩动弹不得，她非常清楚自己现在成了人质，如果试图反抗，他就会用九毫米子弹让她脑袋开花。

"There's a good reason someone said there can be a crisis _and_ an opportunity, Colonel," he said, grinning calmly as he brought out the detonator for them to see. "It took us long and hard to get this far, and now, she's here, so drop your weapon."  
"有人说过危机中蕴含机遇，上校，这话说得有道理，"他平静地笑着，掏出引爆器让他们看。"我们费尽周折才走到这一步，现在，她就在这儿，放下你的武器。"

"What the…" Misato mumbled.  
"什么鬼…"美里咕哝道。

---

With complete urgency and unaware that a couple of security teams were going after them, Tsutomo, Natsumi and half his team were running through the corridor, towards the launch cages when he heard the radio net chatter on his walkie-talkie, saying about Unit-02 on the loose and a hostage situation involving Asuka and the mole.  
全然急迫且未察觉几支安保小队正追捕他们，筒本、夏美和他半队人马正沿着走廊奔向发射笼，这时他听到步话机里无线电网的嘈杂声，提到 02 号机失控以及涉及明日香和内鬼的人质事件。

"Chrissakes," he muttered. "Shit's happening!"  
"天哪，"他咕哝着。"事情发生了！"

Natsumi looked surprised. "Pardon me?"  
夏美看起来很惊讶。"你说什么？"

"What?" one of his men with the nametag Sasaki asked as he sprinted with his MP5 juggling in his hands.  
"什么？"一个胸前挂着佐佐木名牌的队员问道，他一边跑一边双手摆弄着 MP5 冲锋枪。

"I'd say we have an Eva on the loose, and we also have a hostage situation! Safeties off and ROE's on, guys!" he barked, ROE being the acronym for Rules of Engagement. They were now less than a hundred yards to the launch cages.  
"我说我们这儿有个伊娃在逃，还有一起人质事件！安全装置关闭，交战规则启动，伙计们！" 他吼道，ROE 是交战规则的缩写。他们现在距离发射笼不到一百码。

"Who?" Sasaki questioned.  
"谁？" 佐佐木问道。

"The Second Children has a gun to her head! That means we have our fucking mole! Kendall!"  
"二号少女被人用枪指着头！这意味着我们内部有该死的内鬼！肯德尔！"

"Sir!" the man named Kendall responded; the ex-Marine sniper had a Heckler and Koch MSG90A1 sniper rifle strapped to his back, apart from gripping the FN90 bullpup submachine gun in his hands.  
"长官！" 名叫肯德尔的男人回应道；这位前海军陆战队狙击手背上绑着一把赫克勒&科赫 MSG90A1 狙击步枪，手里还紧握着 FN90 无托式冲锋枪。

"I want you to position yourself right above the cages and try to get a clear shot, okay?" Tsutomo said.  
"我要你定位在笼子正上方，尽量找好射击角度，明白吗？" 堤摩说。

"Affirmative, Captain!" Kendall answered.  
"明白，队长！" 肯德尔回答。

---

"Like that boy," Sanderson said, referring to Kaworu as Misato set down her pistol on the platform deck, "I'm also a messenger, and I've been sent here to make sure the Committee has a clear path for them to walk on."  
"就像那个男孩，" 桑德森说道，提及了渚薰，而美里将她的手枪放在了平台甲板上，"我也是一个信使，我被派来确保委员会有一条清晰的道路可走。"

"You…" Misato said, clenching her teeth in anger, yet helpless to respond.  
"你…" 美里咬牙切齿，愤怒却无言以对。"

"I believe in anything they believed in," Sanderson went on, as he toyed the detonator in his hand, "because life on Earth is nothing but brief, and an individual is merely an insignificant cog in a machine. For that reason the Committee placed me here so that by the time Instrumentality comes I have no pain to feel, no hardship, but rather we can all be gods."  
"我相信他们所相信的一切，" 桑德森继续说道，手中摆弄着引爆器，"因为地球上的生命不过是短暂的，个体只是机器中微不足道的齿轮。正因如此，委员会将我安置于此，以便在人类补完计划到来时，我感受不到痛苦，没有困苦，相反，我们都能成为神。"

Unaware of her presence, Sanderson didn't know that Rei was bent over, fingering a six-inch pipe wrench she found in an open toolbox, carefully taking hold of it as if poised to strike. Misato noticed this, but decided not to react, preferring to go with Sanderson's flow as if nothing happened.  
桑德森并未察觉她的存在，不知道丽正弯腰摆弄着她在敞开的工具箱里找到的一把六英寸管钳，小心翼翼地握住它，仿佛随时准备出击。美里注意到了这一点，但决定不作反应，宁愿顺着桑德森的节奏，仿佛什么都没发生。

"You're full of shit," Misato retorted.  
“你满嘴胡言，”美里反驳道。

"And you can't stop us, either," Sanderson replied. "Everything's in motion as we speak."  
“你们也阻止不了我们，”桑德森回应，“一切正如我们所说，正在推进中。”

Despite the weight of the wrench, Rei hefted it with both hands as she stood up, poised herself as if ready to throw the Spear of Longinus, and with all of her strength threw the wrench at Sanderson.  
尽管扳手沉重，丽还是双手举起它，站起身来，仿佛准备投掷隆基努斯之枪一般摆好姿势，然后用尽全力将扳手朝桑德森扔去。

The wrench struck him in the head, momentarily causing him to utter a cry and wobbled on his feet, stunned. Taking advantage of this lapse, Asuka swung around and elbowed Sanderson's chest, before kicking him away with a roundhouse to his solar plexus.  
扳手击中了他的头部，让他一时发出惊呼，脚步踉跄，陷入短暂的眩晕。阿斯卡抓住这个空隙，转身用肘部猛击桑德森的胸膛，紧接着一记回旋踢踢向他的太阳神经丛，将其击退。

But Sanderson still had the pistol as he flailed, with the finger on the trigger and Asuka in his sights, he raged, "Fuck it, you're dead!"  
但桑德森在挥舞中仍握着手枪，手指扣在扳机上，瞄准了阿斯卡，他咆哮道：“去他妈的，你去死吧！”

The mole pressed the detonator button and pulled the trigger at the same time.  
鼹鼠同时按下了引爆按钮并扣动了扳机。

---

The satellite station was the first to go, as explosives planted at the base of the largest parabolic antenna blew up, flinging bits and pieces of plastic and metal, shrapnel ripping out the electronics and wires.  
首先是卫星站，安装在最大抛物面天线基部的炸药爆炸了，塑料和金属的碎片四散飞溅，弹片撕裂了电子设备和电线。

Next was the massive Bakelite pumping station, two of the bombs knocking out the turbopumps, the state phase modulator and the circuit box; within ten seconds after the explosion, Bakelite leaked and flooded the chamber.  
接下来是庞大的胶木泵站，两枚炸弹摧毁了涡轮泵、状态相位调制器和电路箱；爆炸后十秒内，胶木泄漏并淹没了整个房间。

The gun director system installed on the hillside became another victim, plastique tearing out the base of this tower-mounted system, which served to direct gun and missile batteries with targeting information from its array of sensors and optics. Tottering for a moment, the tower then fell to its side and crashed into the ground.  
安装在山坡上的炮兵指挥系统成了又一个牺牲品，塑胶炸药摧毁了这座塔式系统的基座，该系统通过其传感器和光学设备阵列提供的目标信息来引导火炮和导弹电池。塔身摇晃了一瞬，随后侧倒并砸向地面。

Finally and aboveground, two of the circuit boxes, belonging to the largest gates leading to the Geofront, were blasted into pieces, thus rendering the gates inoperable and cannot be closed.  
最终，地面上两个属于通往地底都市最大闸门的电路箱被炸成碎片，导致闸门无法操作且无法关闭。

---

Sanderson thought he got her as he pulled the trigger, but instead he yelled as a bullet struck the slide of his pistol, ruining his aim and the weapon flew out of his hand, landed into the drink and sank out of sight; the bullet veered off, harmlessly embedding itself into an empty drum about fifty yards away.  
桑德森以为自己击中了她，当他扣动扳机时，却突然大叫起来，一颗子弹击中了他的手枪滑套，破坏了他的瞄准，武器脱手飞出，落入饮料中沉没不见；子弹偏转，无害地嵌入五十码外的一个空桶里。

He didn't know that Sergeant Aaron Kendall, lying prone on the upper platform above them and hidden behind the shadows, was waiting for Sanderson to do the wrong thing.  
他不知道，在上方的平台上有阴影掩护的地方，躺着的警官亚伦·肯德尔正等着桑德森犯错。

"Captain, I got his gun but I think he blew up something," Kendall said through the throat mike as he thought he felt several tremors rocking the Geofront. "Shit, I can't get a clear shot," he muttered.  
“队长，我拿到了他的枪，但我觉得他引爆了什么，”肯德尔通过喉麦说道，他感觉到了几阵震动摇晃着地表。“该死，我没法瞄准，”他低声咒骂。

"Come again?" Tsutomo blurted back.  
“再说一遍？”津友木脱口而出。

Peering through the Tasco scope attached onto his rifle, Kendall then saw Misato lunge at Sanderson and the two crashed onto the walkway, before they began exchanging blows.  
透过安装在步枪上的 Tasco 瞄准镜，肯德尔看到 Misato 向 Sanderson 扑去，两人一起摔倒在走道上，随即开始互殴。

"That fucker blew up something with a detonator of sorts, and now the Colonel's trying to beat the hell out of the bastard!"  
“那个混蛋用某种起爆器炸了什么东西，现在上校正试图狠狠揍那家伙一顿！”

"That's it, I'm coming!" Tsutomo exclaimed.  
“就这样，我来了！”筒本喊道。

---

After he received two punches from Misato, one in the stomach and another on the jaw, Sanderson retaliated by throwing a hard straight into her chest, causing the woman to reel back before he kicked her to the stomach.  
在米萨托给了他两拳，一拳打在肚子上，另一拳打在下巴后，桑德森回敬了一记重拳直击她的胸口，使她踉跄后退，紧接着他又一脚踢向她的腹部。

On all fours, Misato coughed and wheezed, and Sanderson was poised to kick her again when Tsutomo grabbed him by the shoulders and punched twice in the ribs.  
米萨托四肢着地，咳嗽着喘息，桑德森正准备再次踢她时，津友茂抓住他的肩膀，对着他的肋骨连击两拳。

The two men traded punches and kicks, until the mole grabbed his arm and was about to throw him off the walkway when Misato pulled him back and in a sideways motion slammed him back to the walkway.  
两人互换拳脚，直到那个鼹鼠抓住他的手臂，准备将他甩下走道时，米萨托将他拽回，并以侧身动作将他猛地摔回走道上。

"Sonofabitch!" Misato yelled as she landed two more punches into Sanderson's face, adrenaline flowing in her bloodstream and driving her thrice the fury. Unfazed, the mole's arms shot up and grabbed her throat, attempting to choke her down, before he felt Tsutomo going for him again and he swung his right arm and planted an elbow to the agent's face.  
“该死的混蛋！”美里吼道，她又往桑德森的脸上揍了两拳，肾上腺素在血液中奔涌，让她怒火中烧。桑德森不为所动，双臂猛地抬起，抓住她的喉咙，试图将她掐晕，就在这时，他感觉到津友再次向他扑来，于是他挥动右臂，用肘部猛击特工的脸。

With Tsutomo keeping Sanderson preoccupied as they struggled, Misato dropped onto her knees and tried to get her breath back. Only then she saw the detonator that the mole had dropped, and she picked it up.  
津友与桑德森纠缠不休，美里跪倒在地，试图喘口气。直到这时，她才看到鼹鼠掉落的引爆器，便捡了起来。

"Shit," she cursed as it dawned upon her that the mole pushed the button, causing her to wonder what he blew up at the same time he was about to fire a shot at Asuka, who now stood there with Shinji, protecting the girl by having her hide behind him.  
“该死，”她咒骂道，意识到鼹鼠已经按下了按钮，这让她同时想知道他炸毁了什么，就在他即将向明日香开枪的时候，明日香此刻正与真嗣站在一起，将女孩护在身后。

"Hey kids!" Misato yelled. "You guys go first!"  
"嘿，孩子们！" 美里喊道。"你们先走！"

"What?" Shinji responded loudly.  
"什么？" 真嗣大声回应。

"Go get yourself ready to launch!"  
"去准备发射！"

Shinji was distraught, holding Asuka tightly by the wrist. "What about you?"  
真嗣心烦意乱，紧紧抓住明日香的手腕。“那你呢？”

Misato pointed her finger at Unit-01. "Damn it, just go! That's an order and I'm sure there's a crew waiting for you to prep! We'll deal with this fucking bastard!"  
美里用手指着初号机。“该死，快走！这是命令，我相信还有一队人在等你准备！我们会处理这个该死的混蛋！”

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other for a moment, before they nodded. No time to waste, not until all of this was over, but just as they were about to leave, the couple was shocked to see Rei levitating on her own, moving across the lake of coolant, weaving through the wreckage of what was left of Unit-02's restraint frame.  
真嗣和明日香对视了一会儿，然后点了点头。没有时间浪费了，直到这一切结束之前，但就在他们准备离开时，这对情侣震惊地看到丽自己悬浮起来，穿过冷却液湖面，穿梭在零号机约束框架的残骸中。

"W… What the hell?" Asuka stammered in shock.  
"这…这到底是怎么回事？" 明日香结巴着，震惊不已。

"Where you're going?" Shinji called out to Rei, who pivoted to face the boy.  
"你要去哪儿？" 真嗣向转身面对他的绫波喊道。

"Like you, I must deal with him," the girl said before she moved on.  
"和你一样，我必须面对他，" 女孩说完便继续前行。

Shinji reached out with his right arm and exclaimed, "But… Wait!"  
真嗣伸出右臂，大声喊道：“但是……等等！”

"I will explain later," she said before dropping down into the vast maw of the shaft leading all the way to Terminal Dogma; at the same time the PA system now called for a general evacuation of the complex.  
“我稍后解释，”她说话间便跳入了通往终端教条区的深井；与此同时，PA 系统开始呼叫整个设施的全面疏散。

Without expecting her, Natsumi swung Shinji around and said, "C'mon, you don't want to stand around here while the world falls apart, right?"  
没等她反应过来，夏美一把拽过真嗣，说道：“快点，你不会想在世界崩塌时还站在这里发呆吧？”

---

With the explosions, activity at the Command Center redoubled as reports filtered in, demanding orders, queries and other needed information:  
随着爆炸声响起，指挥中心的行动愈发紧张，各种报告纷至沓来，要求下达指令、解答疑问以及其他所需信息：

"The satellite station's down!"  
“卫星站失联了！”  
"Gate 3 inoperable! It's been blown to pieces, and we can't close it!"  
“三号门无法运作！已被炸成碎片，无法关闭！”  
"The Bakelite pumping station's been struck!"  
"贝克莱特泵站被击中了！"  
"We need backup! Fire's broke out down here!"  
"我们需要支援！这里起火了！"  
"I have six injured in the lab, need some medics on the double!"  
"实验室里有六名伤员，急需医疗人员速来！"

At the upper tier of the command bridge, Gendo watched as events unfolded before him, knowing that in any way his plans were coming to fruition.  
在指挥桥的上层，源堂注视着眼前展开的事件，深知他的计划正以某种方式逐步实现。

"Sir, we have a reading at the launch cages," an operator reported to Gendo, who simply sat behind his desk, palms propped before his face. "We're detecting two distinct Angel emission patterns in that vicinity. Should we shut the shaft bulkheads tight?"  
“长官，发射笼有动静，”一名操作员向源堂报告，他只是坐在办公桌后，双手撑在脸前。“我们在附近检测到两种不同的使徒发射模式。是否应该关闭竖井的舱门？”

"Shut them," Gendo ordered, "Anything to give the Third Children more time to spare."  
“关闭它们，”源堂命令道，“任何能给第三适格者争取更多时间的事情都要做。”

"We have another situation in the launch cages," a second operator added, bringing up another CCTV feed onto the main screen, which showed Misato and Tsutomo trying to neutralize Sanderson.  
"发射笼里又出状况了，" 另一位操作员补充道，将另一个监控画面调至主屏幕，画面中显示着美里和津友正在试图制服桑德森。

"So, this is the mole they're talking about," Gendo said. "Let them do their business."  
"这就是他们所说的内鬼，" 源堂说道。"让他们处理自己的事。

"And Unit One's about to launch, sir," the operator spoke, adding another feed showing Shinji boarding the Entry Plug.  
"初号机即将出击，长官，" 操作员报告，同时调出另一个画面，显示真嗣正在登上插入栓。

_Once again,_ Gendo told himself with satisfaction, _everything is working according to plan._  
又一次，碇源堂满意地告诉自己，一切都在按计划进行。

---

With Unit-02 now levitating with him, Kaworu looked downward as massive bulkheads shuttered close and tight, but he shook his head, watching the Eva's feet land on the first bulkhead she encountered, stomped hard until the sandwiched sheet of armor cracked and gave way under the strain of the Eva's immense weight.  
随着二号机与他一同悬浮，渚薰向下望去，巨大的舱门缓缓关闭并紧锁，但他摇了摇头，注视着 EVA 的脚落在第一个舱门上，用力踩踏，直到夹在中间的装甲板在 EVA 巨大重量的压力下破裂并屈服。

Meanwhile, hundreds of meters above their heads, Shinji was inside Unit-01, now halfway done with the emergency launch procedures, fully immersed into LCL and wearing headsets on his head. Surprisingly he felt comfortable as the familiar hum and warmth of the Entry Plug enveloped him, as he read off the data on his HUD.  
与此同时，在他们头顶数百米的高空，真嗣正身处初号机内部，紧急发射程序已进行到一半，完全沉浸在 LCL 中，头上戴着耳机。令人惊讶的是，他感到舒适，随着插入栓熟悉的嗡鸣和温暖包围着他，他读取着 HUD 上的数据。

"I'm ready for launch," he reported to Natsumi and the crew chief, both behind a console and doing some final checks while Asuka watched them. "Plug depth's all right at point one-twenty, my systems are green, and sync rate is in the zone!"  
"我已准备就绪，" 他向夏美和机组组长报告，两人正站在控制台后进行最后的检查，而明日香在一旁观察。"插头深度为 1.20，我的系统一切正常，同步率也在理想范围内！"

Suddenly he wondered where Misato and Tsutomo had gone to along with the assailant, as he couldn't see them at all from this vantage point, and then there was no sign of them on the walkway.  
突然，他好奇美里和津友母与袭击者去了哪里，从这个角度完全看不到他们，连走道上也没有他们的踪影。

The young man shook his head. _Misato can take care of herself,_ he told in his thoughts.  
年轻人摇了摇头。美里能照顾好自己，他在心中这样告诉自己。

"You're good to go, kid!" Natsumi shouted with a thumbs-up.  
“你没问题了，孩子！”夏美竖起大拇指喊道。

"Go grab the cables on the gantry that's at the main shaft!" the crew chief added, pointing at the direction of the shaft, and Shinji could now see a gantry crane right above, its hook swinging back and forth along with an attached harness.  
“去把主轴上那个工作台的电缆拿过来！”工头指着轴的方向补充道，真嗣现在能看到上方正好有一台工作台起重机，它的钩子连着安全带来回摆动。

"I copy and I can see it," Shinji answered as the final bolts on the restraints were loosened, the hoses and the main power cord were unplugged, and the framework that held the Eva in place began to part while the coolant in the tank was drained at a fast rate.  
“我明白了，也能看到。”真嗣回答道，随着固定装置上的最后一颗螺栓被松开，软管和主电源线被拔掉，固定 Eva 的框架开始分开，而储罐中的冷却液则以快速度排出。

"You're on extended power, kid," the crew chief advised, pointing at the external power pack that was attached to the pauldrons. "You're twenty mins max and counting! That's twenty minutes!"  
"你现在是延长供电状态，小子，" 队长提醒道，指着连接在肩甲上的外部电源包。"你最多只能撑二十分钟，而且还在倒计时！就二十分钟！"

"She's all yours," Natsumi chimed in.  
"她现在是你的了，" 娜兹美插话道。"

"Okay, thanks!" the young man replied, before holding onto the butterfly handles, glanced at his power meter. He then saw that the tank was now empty, thus allowing him free reign to move, by willing the Eva to walk, and she responded as if a natural extension of Shinji's body and limbs.  
"好的，谢谢！" 年轻人回答，然后握住蝴蝶形状的操纵杆，瞥了一眼电源表。他随即发现油箱已经空了，这意味着他可以自由移动，通过意念让 Eva 行走，而她就像新治身体和四肢的自然延伸一样回应着。"

'One more thing," Asuka said, taking hold of the radio.  
'还有一件事，"明日香说着，抓住了无线电。

"What?" Shinji demanded.  
“什么？”真嗣追问道。

"You break her, dummy, and I'll break your neck," she sternly warned, referring to her Unit-02.  
“你弄坏了她，傻瓜，我就拧断你的脖子，”她严厉警告道，指的是她的二号机。

Shinji nodded. "I know," he acknowledged. "I'll be back."  
真嗣点点头。“我知道，”他承认道，“我会回来的。”

---

Unknown to Shinji and in a sideroom away from Unit-01's cage, Misato was completely dazed and sprawled among the litter of boxes after Sanderson knocked her out with a fist to her abdomen. Right now, with the woman nearly unconscious, Tsutomo was completely focused on the mole as they exchanged blows and checks, making feints and dodges.  
真嗣并不知情，在远离零号机牢笼的一间侧室里，美里被桑德森一拳击中腹部后完全懵了，瘫倒在散乱的箱子之间。此刻，美里几乎昏迷不醒，津友则全神贯注于与间谍的交锋，双方你来我往，虚实相间，闪避腾挪。

_Tough bastard,_ he muttered while countering the mole's advances, wondering about Sanderson's unusually resilient stamina even after several beatings. _Where the hell he got his training from?_  
真是个硬汉，他一边反击间谍的进攻，一边暗自嘀咕，对桑德森在多次打击后依然异常坚韧的耐力感到好奇。这家伙到底是从哪儿受的训练？

The split-second distraction afforded Sanderson the opportunity to charge straight at Tsutomo, and lunged forward to knock the agent down among the piles of cans. He then picked up a meter-length of steel pipe and swung it at Tsutomo, who dodged away to prevent from being struck.  
那一刹那的分神给了桑德森直冲向津友的机会，他猛地前扑，将特工撞倒在成堆的罐头之间。随后，他抄起一根一米长的钢管，朝津友挥去，后者急忙闪避，以免被击中。

_Two can play this game,_ Tsutomo said, grabbing another length of pipe on the floor, and with both hands and his old kendo skills, he struck and parried Sanderson's blows.  
这游戏我也会玩，津友说着，从地上抓起另一根管子，双手并用，凭借昔日的剑道技艺，与桑德森的攻击展开了激烈的交锋。

However, to make himself less of a target and deploying the aikido technique of being close to his opponent, Sanderson got hold of Tsutomo's shirt and slammed his forehead into the agent's, landing him on the floor.  
然而，为了减少自己成为目标的可能性，并运用合气道的近身技巧，桑德森抓住了津友的衬衫，猛地将额头撞向特工，将其击倒在地。

The mole picked up the pipe again, and was readying to strike down Tsutomo when the agent kicked out his feet, making the mole land sideways. Tsutomo slowly stood up, and already he was sore in several places, and surely he felt his nose must been broken. He then spat out the blood that was in his mouth, and wiped it away using his sleeves.  
那鼹鼠再次拾起管子，正准备向 Tsutomo 猛击时，特工一脚踢出，使鼹鼠侧身倒地。Tsutomo 缓缓站起身，身上多处已感疼痛，想必鼻子也已骨折。他随即吐出口中的血，用袖子擦去。

But Tsutomo didn't know that Sanderson unsheathed a knife secreted from his belt, and without warning he stabbed forward, forcing the agent to back away, and without realizing it his foot tripped on an unseen toolbox, pitching him downwards.  
但 Tsutomo 不知 Sanderson 已从腰带中抽出一把隐藏的刀，未作警告便向前刺去，迫使特工后退，却不慎踩到一只看不见的工具箱，身体向前倾倒。

Now with Tsutomo sprawled over the floor, Sanderson was ready to deliver the coup de grace, retracting his right arm to begin the final swing to stab the agent.  
此刻 Tsutomo 趴在地上，Sanderson 准备给予致命一击，收回右臂，开始最后的挥刀，意图刺向特工。

Suddenly Sanderson was writhing on two feet, screaming as he did, and then Tsutomo saw Sasaki holding a stun gun in his hands, giving the mole enough voltage to give him the trots for weeks, until he let go of the trigger and the mole fell down, still wriggling and twitching.  
突然间，桑德森在两只脚上扭动着，尖叫着，随后津友看到佐佐木手里拿着电击枪，给了那鼹鼠足够的电压让他腹泻数周，直到他松开扳机，鼹鼠倒下，仍在抽搐扭动。

Tsutomo took several breaths, before he got up on his feet and said, "Shit, I thought it was going to be over for me, Sarge."  
津友深吸了几口气，然后站起身来说：“该死，我还以为我要完蛋了，中士。”

Staff Sergeant Hiromu Sasaki smiled as he pulled the electrodes out of Sanderson's back. "Yeah, we always watch our backs," he said before Tsutomo's other team members barged into the room and tied up the unconscious mole's wrists, before grabbing him by the shoulders and then dragging him away.  
一级军士长广武佐佐木微笑着从桑德森背上拔出电极。“是啊，我们总是注意自己的背后，”他说完，津友的其他队员冲进房间，绑住昏迷鼹鼠的手腕，然后抓住他的肩膀，把他拖走了。

Just then Misato's eyes were now open as she rubbed her temples, prompting Tsutomo to grab her hand and pull the woman onto her feet. "Thanks," she said. "Now, what we should do with that bastard?"  
就在这时，美里揉着太阳穴睁开了眼睛，津友见状立刻抓住她的手，将她拉了起来。“谢谢，”她说，“现在，我们该怎么对付那个混蛋？”

Tsutomo grinned while checking his nose's cartilage; Sanderson almost broke it, causing some bleeding from the wound. "Make him sing, what else?" he suggested.  
津友一边检查鼻软骨，一边咧嘴笑着；桑德森几乎把它打断了，伤口流了些血。“让他招供，不然呢？”他提议道。

"Damn right, and where's those kids?" Misato asked, dusting herself off.  
“没错，那些孩子呢？”美里一边拍掉身上的灰尘，一边问道。

"Shinji should be on his way by now, ma'am," Sasaki said. "He's in Unit One, and in hot pursuit. I also saw Asuka with Doctor Odani up at the control platform."  
“真嗣应该已经在路上了，女士，”佐佐木说。“他在初号机里，正在紧追不舍。我还看到明日香和织谷博士在控制平台上。”

The woman sighed. "I know he'll do the right thing," she said.  
女人叹了口气。“我知道他会做正确的事，”她说。

---

Tethered to the cable as she was lowered by the gantry crane, Shinji stared below to find a glint of light beyond Unit-01's feet; already he was sure that Kaworu and Unit-02 were smashing their way downward. He also saw another point of light halfway there.  
被吊车吊着，通过缆绳缓缓下降，真嗣凝视下方，在初号机脚边发现了一丝闪光；他确信，薰和二号机正在向下猛冲。他还看到中途有另一个光点。

It was Rei, her AT-Field at full power as she levitated and descended, following Kaworu.  
那是丽，她的 AT 力场全开，悬浮着跟随真嗣缓缓下降。

To make sure, Shinji had Unit-01 bring out her Prog Knife, and readied himself for anything untoward as the melee weapon's blade gave out a pinkish glow.  
为了确保安全，真嗣让初号机取出她的进度之刃，并准备好应对任何不测，近战武器的刀刃发出粉红色的光芒。

"You're getting close," the crane operator above him said through the radio. "We're letting out more cable for you."  
“你越来越近了，”他头顶上的起重机操作员通过无线电说道，“我们正在为你放出更多缆绳。”

Shinji nodded without a word, as he remembered the last few days he had with his new friend. Those days, he thought, seem to be an lifetime to him as Kaworu changed his life and how he perceived himself as a person.  
真嗣默默地点了点头，回想起与新朋友在一起的最后几天。那些日子，对他来说，仿佛一生般漫长，因为渚薰改变了他的人生，以及他对自己的看法。

Yet it was hard for him to stomach the reality that Kaworu was really an Angel with a mission, ordered to make contact with this entity called Lilith, and such a contact could cause the end of human existence.  
然而，他难以接受的是，渚薰实际上是一位肩负使命的天使，被命令与一个名为莉莉丝的实体接触，而这样的接触可能导致人类存在的终结。

He wondered if all that was said in Kaji's secret documents were all true, forewarning them of the inevitable.  
他不知道卡兹秘密文件中所说的一切是否都是真的，是否都在预言那不可避免的结局。

If Kaworu was indeed an agent, then who were his masters? Who gave him the orders to do this?  
如果渚薰确实是特工，那么他的主使是谁？是谁命令他这么做的？

It all boiled down to those men known as the Committee, putting their Human Instrumentality Project to full motion, and it became clear to Shinji that Kaworu was also a sacrifice, destined to die.  
这一切都归结于那些被称为委员会的人，他们全力推进人类补完计划，而真嗣也明白，渚薰同样是一个牺牲品，注定要死去。

Shinji then wondered if his father was watching all this, presumably waiting for him to make the final blow, and then he thought of the nightmare he had shortly being awakened by the klaxons.  
真嗣随后想知道他的父亲是否在注视着这一切，大概是在等待他做出最后的打击，然后他想起了不久前被警报声唤醒时的噩梦。

In this nightmare, he saw himself sitting in the Entry plug, and right before him Kaworu had Unit-01's hands tightly wrapped around his body, and he tried to talk but words couldn't leave his mouth; he also saw Kaworu speak, but he couldn't hear what he was saying.  
在这场噩梦中，他看见自己坐在插入栓里，正前方是 Kaworu 被初号机的双手紧紧束缚着身体，他想说话却发不出声音；他也看到 Kaworu 在说话，却听不清他在说什么。

He tried to take control of the Eva, but then he helplessly watched as Unit-01 suddenly clenched her fist, instantly reducing Kaworu's body into pulp, and his head popped out and then dropped away.  
他试图控制 Eva，却无助地看着初号机突然握紧拳头，瞬间将 Kaworu 的身体碾成肉泥，头颅弹出后随即滚落一旁。

Only then did Shinji woke up.  
直到那时，真嗣才惊醒过来。

Yet this time the nightmare was being reenacted for real, and he feared the inevitable, making his insides turn cold.  
然而这次噩梦正在真实上演，他害怕那不可避免的结局，让他的内心变得冰冷。

"Why?" Shinji whispered his doubts. _"Why it has to be me?"_  
“为什么？”真嗣低声表达了他的疑惑。“为什么非得是我？”

**Author's Notes:** In the last two days, instead of working on my other crossover fic, I decided it best to concentrate on finishing the last three chapters to set the stage for _Blood and Water_, the final season and hence the reinterpretation of End of Eva.  
作者笔记：在过去的两天里，我决定最好专注于完成最后三章，为血与水——最终季以及对《EVA》结局的重新解读——奠定基础，而不是继续我的其他跨界小说。

As I have understood, with little much else to do, writing is now the few creative outlets I can have, amidst my personal issues that I have to deal with, including an uneasy life in a difficult household. Yet I don't want my problems affect my writing, and the last time it did there was much time wasted when those hours could've been put to good use.  
正如我所理解，在几乎没有其他事情可做的情况下，写作成了我为数不多的几个创意出口之一，尽管我必须面对个人问题，包括在一个困难的家庭中过着不安定的生活。但我不想让我的问题影响到我的写作，上次它们影响时，那些本可以好好利用的时间都被浪费了。

Regarding this week, it's been unfortunate to hear much loss of life, one involving a songstress whom I don't know much but famous in some way; and another, with almost hundreds more at the hands of a deranged man, which brings us to think hard just how valuable life is, and why it shouldn't be wasted or destroyed, and as much as I have to endure more of life's storms, surely I know that sooner or later there's going to be a silver lining in the clouds.  
关于这周，听到许多生命的逝去令人遗憾，其中一位是我不太熟悉但有一定名气的女歌手；另一起事件中，近百人丧命于一个疯狂之人的手中，这让我们深思生命的宝贵，以及为何不应浪费或摧毁它。尽管我还要经历更多生活的风暴，但我确信，迟早云层中会出现一线希望。

Anyway, by the time I finish Season Three, I'll have more time to write without being bothered, as I'll be managing my time properly.  
无论如何，当我完成第三季时，我将会有更多时间不受打扰地写作，因为我将合理安排我的时间。

Until then, stay tuned and as always, I'm open to constructive comments and criticism.  
在此之前，敬请期待，一如既往，我欢迎建设性的评论和批评。

Thank you and good evening.  
谢谢大家，晚安。

### Chapter 39 A Beautiful Lie  
第 39 章 美丽的谎言

Amidst the ongoing emergency, Misato, Tsutomo and the other members of his team calmly stared down at the still-unconscious Sanderson after they dragged him out of the room.  
在紧急情况持续之际，Misato、Tsutomo 和他的团队成员们冷静地盯着被他们从房间里拖出来的仍然昏迷的 Sanderson。

"So, what's gonna be next for us?" Sasaki asked, still holding his submachine gun.  
“那么，接下来我们该怎么办？”Sasaki 问道，仍然握着他的冲锋枪。

Tsutomo shrugged. "I suppose we should drag this bastard out of here, put him in the slammer and we'll explain everything even if they'll slap us with whatever that's from the rulebooks."  
Tsutomo 耸了耸肩。“我想我们应该把这个混蛋拖出去，关进牢里，然后我们会解释一切，即使他们会用规则书上的任何条款来处罚我们。”

Just then Asuka came down the stairs from the upper walkway, followed by Natsumi and the crew chief. The girl stood before Misato and said, "What's going to happen next?"  
就在这时，明日香从上层通道的楼梯上走了下来，身后跟着夏美和组长。女孩站在美里面前，问道：“接下来会发生什么？”

Using her foot, Misato prodded Sanderson's unmoving prone form. "We'd better leave and link up with the Sub-Commander," she said. "Shinji can handle himself, I'm sure of it."  
美里用脚踢了踢桑德森一动不动的身体。“我们最好离开，与副司令汇合，”她说，“我相信真嗣能照顾好自己。”

Asuka frowned. "And what about—" she said but was cut off when she was surprised by the unexpected appearance of a hundred or so security troopers surrounding them, their weapons aimed at Misato and Tsutomo's rogue SRT team, laser dots dancing upon their chests and foreheads.  
明日香皱起眉头。“那——”她刚开口，就被突如其来的一百多名安全部队士兵包围的情景打断了，他们的武器对准了美里和津友的叛变 SRT 小队，激光瞄准点在他们胸前和额头上跳动。

Morrissey walked out from one of the double doors, and exclaimed, "Drop your weapons!"  
莫里塞从其中一扇双开门中走出，大声喝道：“放下武器！”

Without saying a word and only a nod, Tsutomo and his team carefully placed their weapons on the walkway and raised their arms, hands behind their heads.  
没有多言，只一个点头，堤文和他的团队小心翼翼地将武器放在走道上，并举起双臂，双手置于脑后。

"All right," Tsutomo said. "You win."  
“好吧，”堤文说，“你赢了。”

"You, of all people, have disappointed me," Morrissey said, his voice rising with his hands clenched into fists. "What all of you did is an act of treason, conspiracy, sedition, armed provocation, abetting and aiding escape of prisoners, and above all, disregarding orders!"  
"你，尤其是你，让我失望透顶，"莫里森说道，声音随着紧握的拳头而升高。"你们所做的一切，是叛国、阴谋、煽动、武装挑衅、协助逃犯，最重要的是，无视命令！"

The pretender then walked towards the group, and with his withering stare singled out Misato, Natsumi and Tsutomo.  
那个冒名顶替者随后走向人群，用他那令人凋零的目光单独盯上了美里、夏美和筒本。

"You were such daring heroes yesterday, and then now you did the unthinkable," Morrissey lectured. "Now I ask you: where your loyalties lie with? Where and to whom? Certainly today it's not to Fuyutsuki."  
"昨天你们还那么勇敢无畏，今天却做出了难以想象的事，"莫里森训斥道。"现在我问你们：你们的忠诚何在？对谁？今天显然不是对冬月。"

Unknown to Morrissey, the soldiers who kept their weapons aimed at the renegades were having second thoughts; they deferred their loyalty to him because they thought he was the legitimate commanding officer of their department, by dint of Commander Ikari's approval.  
莫里西并不知情，那些将武器对准叛逆者的士兵们正心生疑虑；他们之所以对他忠诚，是因为他们认为他是伊卡里指挥官认可的部门合法指挥官。

But secretly they considered Misato and Tsutomo their personal heroes, professional soldiers they wanted to emulate, accomplishing the impossible that left them in admiration, giving their profession a good reason for respect. Therefore, the idea of shooting at a bunch of warriors worth their salt was unthinkable.  
但他们私下里将美里和津友视为个人英雄，是他们想要效仿的职业军人，完成了令人钦佩的不可能任务，为他们的职业赢得了尊重。因此，向一群值得尊敬的战士开枪的想法是难以想象的。

"Arrest them!" Morrissey ordered. "Cuff them and say their rights!"  
“逮捕他们！”莫里西命令道，“给他们戴上手铐，并告知他们的权利！”

Not one of those commandoes bothered to move, as they slowly lowered their weapons one by one, flipping their weapons back to safety.  
那些突击队员中没有一个动弹，他们慢慢地一个接一个地放下武器，将枪械调回安全状态。

"Damn it, what the bloody hell are you men are waiting for?" Morrissey chided, but just as he turned around to yell yet another order, he saw Hamamoto rushing towards him, coming out of the door, with the other half of Tsutomo's squad following.  
“该死，你们这帮家伙到底在等什么？”莫里西骂道，但就在他转身准备再次大喊命令时，他看到滨本冲向他，从门口出来，跟着的是津友小队的另一半人。

"What the—" Morrissey yelped, before the Second Section veteran he replaced abruptly early in the day struck him with an straight punch to the face, and the Brit was knocked out cold on the walkway.  
“什么——”莫里西惊叫一声，紧接着他被白天早些时候替换掉的第二分队老兵一记直拳击中脸部，英国人当场在走道上昏了过去。

Satisfied with the one-punch, Hamamoto was snorting like a bull out of the pen. He then stared down at Morrissey's prone body, spat out and barked, "Fuck you and your orders, pretender! You're out of the game!"  
对那一拳感到满意，Hamamoto 像刚出栏的公牛一样哼哧着。他随后低头盯着 Morrissey 俯卧的身体，吐了口唾沫，厉声喝道：“去你的命令，冒牌货！你出局了！”

Using his psychokinetic abilities inherent in his nature, Kaworu Nagisa hefted thousands of tons of Eva Unit-02, the monstrously-sized weapon within his control, as he commanded her to stomp down on any obstacles thrown in their way; seemingly impregnable sheets of armor bulkhead plating buckled and gave way beneath her weight, like an anvil dropped through thin paper.  
利用他天生的心灵遥感能力，渚薰操控着数千吨重的 Eva 二号机，这个在他掌控下的巨型武器，命令她踩碎前进道路上的一切障碍；看似坚不可摧的装甲隔板在她的重量下弯曲破裂，如同铁砧穿过薄纸一般。

As they descended further into the depths of the earth, Kaworu looked up to see Rei coming for him.  
随着他们深入地心，薰抬头看见绫波向他走来。

"What are you doing?" he asked.  
“你在做什么？”他问道。

"I must come along with you even to this end," Rei answered.  
"我必须与你同行，直至终点，" 丽回答道。

Kaworu shook his head. "You should've stayed there."  
薰摇了摇头。"你应该留在那里。"

"I cannot," she insisted. "I would rather complement your effort."  
"我不能，" 她坚持道。"我宁愿助你一臂之力。"

"But what about him?" Kaworu questioned as he pointed upward at Shinji and Unit-01, now closing on the trio. "It's supposed to be just between him and me, and this is supposed to be very personal."  
"但关于他呢？" 渚薰指向上方，指向正逼近三人的真嗣和初号机，"这本应只属于我和他的事，而且是非常私人的。"

"I disagree," Rei objected. "I have my share in this complicity as much as you are, therefore I should be involved because he is my brother."  
"我不同意，" 绫波反驳道，"我和你一样有份参与其中，因此我应该介入，因为他是我弟弟。"

They then looked downward to see Unit-02 encounter yet another armored bulkhead, a meter thick and forged with aerospace alloys, and proceeded to pound it with her feet, hammering her way down until chunks of it fell off. Only then they were able to go through the hole without a hitch.  
随后他们低头看到二号机遇到了又一堵装甲墙，厚达一米，由航空合金锻造，二号机用双脚猛烈锤击，一路砸穿直到碎片脱落。只有这样，他们才能顺利通过那个洞口。

"I am sure he is very upset at this," Rei went on. "It would have been better if you told him firsthand of your plans, and what you wanted to happen."  
"我确信他对此非常沮丧，"丽继续说道，"如果你能亲自告诉他你的计划和你希望发生的事情，那会更好。"

"How he can be made ready for the inevitable," Kaworu countered, "if we couldn't test him and his character? Anytime after this, I'm sure, there will be no peace for NERV, which is why, besides us, Shinji and Asuka stand in the way of their plans… No, I mean, the Committee's plans."  
"如果我们不能测试他和他的性格，他怎么能准备好面对不可避免的事呢？"渚薰反驳道，"在这之后，我可以肯定，NERV 将不会有安宁，这就是为什么除了我们之外，真嗣和明日香也站在他们的计划……不，我是说，委员会的计划的对立面。"

"_You two are such an odd couple, isn't it?" Kyoko chimed in, her voice issuing from the core, communicating by means of telepathy._  
"你们俩真是一对奇怪的组合，不是吗？"京子插话道，她的声音从核心中传出，通过心灵感应进行交流。"

"I'll take that as a compliment, Doctor," Kaworu answered.  
"我会把这当作一种赞美，博士，"渚薰回答道。

_Kyoko sighed. "You put me in this uncomfortable spot of yours," she said, "yet I've finally understood what you mean in terms of necessity regarding with my daughter's boyfriend."  
京子叹了口气。"你把我置于这种不自在的境地，"她说，"但我终于明白了你所说的关于我女儿男朋友的必要性。"_

Kaworu nodded. "Go on."  
渚薰点点头。"继续说。"

"_The first time he came aboard with my daughter," Kyoko spoke, "he was still an untested character, a young man not sure of his place in this world despite this unimaginably huge responsibility placed on his shoulders. In the five minutes they fought that Angel, I quickly got a feel into his psyche, his loves and hates, and everything that consisted of his personality. This kind of affected his ability to become an effective pilot, because he always had this inner pain that's been caused, not surprisingly, by his father, and I also know what kind of man he was."_  
"第一次他带着我女儿上船时，" 绫子说道，"他还未经考验，一个年轻人，尽管肩负着难以想象的重任，却对自己的位置感到迷茫。在那五分钟与使徒的战斗中，我迅速洞察了他的内心，他的爱与恨，以及构成他个性的所有要素。这种内心的痛苦影响了他的驾驶效率，这种痛苦无疑是由他父亲造成的，而且我也知道他父亲是个什么样的人。"

Both Children blinked. "You know Commander Ikari?" Kaworu asked.  
两个孩子都眨了眨眼。"您认识碇司令？" 渚薰问道。

"_That's right," Kyoko confirmed, "by way of his wife, who happens to be my best friend ever since she left France, which is why I was involved in this project shortly after Second Impact… and what a character he was... I mean, for the life of me, it struck me as odd that a good girl like her should be involved with that ambitious_ die Sau_… er, bastard."_  
"没错，" 绫子确认道，"通过他的妻子，她是我从法国离开后最好的朋友，这也是为什么我在第二次冲击后不久就参与了这个项目……他真是个……我的意思是，对我来说，像她那样好的女孩怎么会和那个野心勃勃的混蛋……呃，混账扯上关系，真是奇怪。"

"Seems that the Commander made enemies almost everywhere," Rei commented as she stared at the center of Unit-02, where the core was implanted. "Yet it is only with Mother that he becomes like putty."  
"看来司令在哪儿都树敌不少，" 丽评论道，她凝视着二号机核心植入的中心位置。"但只有在母亲面前，他才会变得像软泥一样。"

_Kyoko laughed at the analogy._ _"Nice one, young woman," she approved. "He's made of ice, conditioned by his past, but surprisingly he thaws out whenever he sees Yui. Indeed, she was his only weakness, and by the way, Rei, is this your first time hearing from me in this way?"_  
京子对这个比喻笑了笑。"说得好，小姑娘，"她赞许道。"他由冰构成，被过去所塑造，但奇怪的是，每当他见到唯，就会融化。确实，她是他唯一的弱点，顺便问一下，丽，这是你第一次以这种方式听到我的话吗？"

Rei nodded. 绫波点点头。

"_Good," Kyoko approved, "because it's clear that Kaworu is probably the best teacher you ever have."_  
"很好，" 京子赞许道，"因为显然，渚薰可能是你遇到过的最好的老师。"

"Thank you," Rei said.  
"谢谢你," 丽说道。

_The woman in the machine sighed once more. "Talk about star-crossed lovers," she said. "I used to watch that movie, before digging into the actual book itself afterwards, thinking that my ex would like to hear me talking about Shakespeare."  
机器中的女人再次叹息。"真是命运多舛的恋人啊," 她说。"我以前常看那部电影，后来又去读了原著，想着我的前任会喜欢听我谈论莎士比亚。"_

"How did you know I liked that movie?" Kaworu asked.  
"你怎么知道我喜欢那部电影？" 薰问道。

"_Nice coincidence," Kyoko said, before she laughed. "You two are acting out something bigger than any drama, and then Shakespeare saying about the world as a stage rings true. We're all in this stage, each of us are players__, while the spotlight's trained on us as we recite our lines."_  
"真巧啊，" 响子笑着说，"你们俩上演的戏码比任何剧都精彩，连莎士比亚说的世界是个舞台都显得真实。我们都在这个舞台上，每个人都是演员，聚光灯打在我们身上，我们念着自己的台词。"

"You're correct," Kaworu agreed.  
"你说得对，" 薰同意道。"

"_On the other hand, you two are a Tanabata ideal, that is, lovers separated by a distance and fate. It's only now that both of you are together."_  
"另一方面，你们俩简直是七夕的理想化身，即被距离和命运分隔的恋人。直到现在，你们才终于在一起。"

"That was what I dreamed of," Rei said. "Ikari blew up the bridge that was to bring us together."  
"那就是我所梦见的，" 丽说道，"碇炸毁了那座本应让我们相连的桥。"

_Kyoko shook her head._ _"He will do anything to bring Yui back, no matter how much the cost, and in the process I have paid my life in participating in his devilish enterprise."_  
京子摇了摇头。"无论代价多大，他都会不惜一切代价让唯回来，而在这个过程中，我为了参与他的魔鬼计划付出了生命的代价。"

"I have fought with him, and if he does so without changing himself first," Rei replied, "I will fight him again to deny his wish."  
"我曾与他战斗过，如果他不先改变自己就那样做，" 丽回答，"我会再次与他战斗，阻止他的愿望。"

---

Closing in with less than two hundred meters and counting, Shinji had a few thoughts left to spare.  
距离缩短至不足两百米，且还在不断逼近，真嗣脑海中还残留着几个念头。

_Is this what you wanted to do? What have you done now? Why do you have to do this?  
这就是你想要的吗？你现在做了什么？为什么非得这么做？_

Shinji clenched his teeth, and decided to talk, so his eye trained at an icon to the right of the HUD, selected the command to turn on the external speaker system installed in Unit-01 and yelled, "Why did you lie to me? WHY BETRAY ME?"  
真嗣咬紧牙关，决定开口，他的目光锁定在 HUD 右侧的一个图标上，选择了开启初号机外部扬声系统的命令，并大喊道：“为什么你要骗我？为何背叛我？”

The outburst disrupted the trio, and both Children looked up to see Shinji and Unit-01 faced Unit-02.  
这突如其来的爆发打断了三人组，两个孩子抬头一看，只见真嗣和初号机正面对着零二号机。

"I've been waiting for you," Kaworu said, but Rei suddenly looked doubtful.  
“我一直在等你，”渚薰说道，但绫波突然显得有些疑惑。

"For what?" Shinji questioned. "Damn it, you befriended me, I gave you my trust, I thought you much as a brother I should've had, I thought you understood me, and now WHY DOES IT HAVE TO COME TO THIS? WHY?"  
“等什么？”真嗣质问道。“该死，你和我交朋友，我给了你我的信任，我以为你就像我本该有的兄弟一样，我以为你理解我，可现在为什么要走到这一步？为什么？”

Just then, without warning Unit-02 unsheathed and grabbed her Prog Knife, ready to attack.  
就在那时，没有预兆地，二号机突然拔出了她的进度之刃，准备发起攻击。

Shinji then stared at Rei and said, "Ayanami, why are you a part of this?"  
真嗣盯着绫波，问道：“绫波，你为何会参与其中？”

"I have a part to play, for I have become involved as much as he is," Rei admitted.  
“我有我的角色要扮演，因为我已经和他一样深陷其中，”绫波坦承道。

"He's an Angel, for God's sake!" Shinji talked back. "You're supposed to stop him!"  
"他可是个天使，看在上帝的份上！" 真嗣反驳道，"你应该阻止他！"

"I cannot," Rei objected. "Because I love him, even if he is an Angel."  
"我做不到，" 绫波反驳道，"因为我爱他，即使他是个天使。"

Shinji shuddered and then and questioned, "How it can be? Have you planned this with him?"  
真嗣颤抖了一下，接着质疑道："这怎么可能？你和他是不是早就计划好了？"

However, before he could bring about another outburst, Unit-02 swung her knife-armed hand to strike at Unit-01, but the other Eva intercepted and parried the blow, the two blades sparking as they came in contact.  
然而，在他引发另一场爆发之前，二号机挥动着刀刃般的手臂向初号机发起攻击，但另一台 Eva 及时拦截并挡开了这一击，两把刀刃接触时迸发出火花。

Shinji's teeth gritted, trying to keep the blade away and then he yelled, "I want this to STOP! I don't want this! Kaworu, for God's sake, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?"  
真嗣咬紧牙关，努力将刀刃推开，随后大喊道：“我想要这一切停止！我不想要这样！卡洛，看在上帝的份上，你疯了吗？”

Kaworu shook his head and remarked, "_Evae, factae de Adamo_, beings detested by humans. Yet I still wonder why do you have to use them for your survival."  
卡洛摇了摇头，评论道：“Eva，源自亚当的造物，人类所憎恶的存在。但我仍想知道，你们为何必须利用它们来求生。”

"They're supposed to stop the likes of you," Shinji replied as he struggled, "and answer the damned question: WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?"  
"他们本该阻止你这样的人，" 真嗣挣扎着回答，"并回答那个该死的问题：你为什么要对我撒谎？"

"Because I don't want you to hear about my bad side," Kaworu admitted. "I'm made in the same way the Evas are; I'm being _natus de Adamo,_ and had this Eva have no soul, I can unite with her."  
"因为我不想让你知道我的阴暗面，" 渚薰承认道，"我和 EVA 一样，是由亚当所生，如果这台 EVA 没有灵魂，我可以与她融合。"

As though infused with more power, Unit-02 began to exert extra effort to overwhelm Unit-01, forcing Shinji to lurch forward, pressing his handles to the limit, before Unit-01's blade was forced to the left and struck Kaworu's AT-Field, which produced an hexagonal ripple.  
仿佛被注入了更多力量，2 号机开始加大力度试图压倒 1 号机，迫使真嗣向前踉跄，将操纵杆推到极限，随后 1 号机的刀被迫向左偏移，击中了渚薰的 AT 力场，产生了一圈六边形的波纹。

"You have an AT-Field!" Shinji exclaimed.  
“你有一个 AT 力场！”真嗣惊呼道。

Kaworu nodded. "That's right," he agreed. "That's what you humans refer to, as this is the holy region that anyone shouldn't touch, and this is the light of the mind. You lilin should be aware of that, and the AT-Field is the wall of the mind that everyone possesses."  
渚薰点头。“没错，”他同意道，“这就是你们人类所说的，这是任何人都不应触碰的神圣领域，这是心灵之光。你们人类应该知道这一点，AT 力场是每个人心中都有的心灵之墙。”

Shinji blinked. "What?" 真嗣眨了眨眼。"什么？"

His hesitation, however, brought Unit-02 to stab Unit-01 in the left shoulder, causing the Third Children to howl in pain.  
然而，他的犹豫让二号机刺中了初号机的左肩，使得第三适格者痛苦地嚎叫起来。

At that point, Rei began to shed tears.  
就在那时，丽开始落泪。

With Morrissey tied up and heaped with Sanderson, and as Hamamoto went about grouping his men together for the next plan, Misato turned to Natsumi and Makoto, who were monitoring events from her laptop.  
莫里西被捆绑并堆在桑德森身上，而浜本正忙着将他的手下集结起来准备下一步计划，美里转向夏美和诚，他们正从她的笔记本电脑上监控着事态。

"Oh, damn," Natsumi muttered. "They cleared several now, and closing to the last level."  
"哦，该死，" 娜兹咪咕哝道。"他们现在已经通过了好几关，正逼近最后一关。"

"What else we have to do next?" Makoto asked as he looked up and faced Misato.  
"接下来我们还有什么要做的？" 真琴抬起头，面对美里问道。"

Misato sighed. "Should we lose contact with Shinji…"  
美里叹了口气。"如果我们与真嗣失去联系……"

The junior officer ran a hand through his hair. "I understand what you mean," he said in a morose tone. "This place has been rigged to go off just in case shit hits the fan."  
年轻的军官用手梳理了一下头发。“我明白你的意思，”他用忧郁的语气说道，“这个地方已经被设置好，一旦情况失控就会引爆。”

"I'm sorry," Misato apologized.  
“对不起，”美里道歉道。

Instead Makoto smiled. "No, never mind… at least we're all in the same boat."  
相反，真琴笑了笑。“没关系……至少我们都在同一条船上。”

Natsumi nodded, but just as she was about to say another word, Tsutomo ran up to them and asked, "Is it all right if we have to follow them down?"  
夏美点点头，但就在她准备再说些什么时，筒友跑过来问道：“我们得跟着他们下去，这样可以吗？”

The others blinked. "What?" Misato questioned.  
其他人眨了眨眼。“什么？”美里疑惑地问。

"We have to go there, and mop up just in case Shinji wins," Tsutomo said, pointing his hand downward.  
“我们得去那里，以防万一真嗣赢了，”筒友说着，手指向下指去。

Misato pondered for a moment, and then answered, "All right, but you guys are ready?"  
美里沉思片刻，然后回答：“好吧，但你们准备好了吗？”

Tsutomo nodded. "Damned right we are."  
筒友点了点头。“当然没错。”

"HEY!" Natsumi yelled, interrupting them all. "Look at that!" she exclaimed, pointing at the laptop's screen.  
"嘿！" 夏美大声喊道，打断了所有人。"看那个！" 她指着笔记本电脑的屏幕惊呼道。

Misato's eyes twitched. "What?"  
美里眼角一跳。“什么？”

"One of them produced an off-the-scale AT-Field," Natsumi reported. "I'm sure that's Rei, and there's nothing for us to see anymore: light waves, radio, EM emissions, _nada_. We're effectively blind for the duration."  
“其中一个展开了超标的 AT 力场，”夏美报告道。“我确信那是绫波，而且我们什么也看不到了：光波、无线电、电磁辐射，全都没有了。在这段时间里，我们实际上是瞎的。”

"Oh, shit," Misato cursed, and motioned to Tsutomo to get ready to go, before she faced the cluster of soldiers gathered around Hamamoto. "Chief, I suppose that I must borrow your men," she said.  
“哦，该死，”美里咒骂一声，示意堤人准备好出发，然后面对聚集在滨本周围的士兵们。“队长，我想我得借用一下你的人手，”她说道。

"To go down there?" Hamamoto questioned.  
"要下去那里吗？" 滨本问道。

"Yeah!" Misato replied. "耶！" 美里回答道。

"Permission granted, Colonel," the old man agreed. "Take some of them to come with you, instead, as I need the other half to deal with Ikari."  
"准许了，上校，" 老人同意道，"带几个人跟你一起去，我需要另一半人手来对付碇。"

"But what about me?" Asuka chimed in. She was standing around, doing nothing at all. "I'm also involved in this morass, right?"  
"那我呢？" 明日香插话道。她站在一旁，无所事事。"我也卷入了这场混乱，对吧？"

Misato smiled. "Come on, then," she said, before threw a salute at Hamamoto and said, "Thanks again, sir."  
美里微笑着。“那就来吧，”她说着，向滨本敬了个礼，并道：“再次感谢您，长官。”

"Go get 'em," Hamamoto muttered as he watched Misato, Asuka, Tsutomo and other troopers rushed back into the corridor, on their way to serve as the cavalry to do the save at the last minute.  
“去吧，干掉他们，”滨本低声说道，目送着美里、明日香、堤人以及其他士兵冲回走廊，准备在最后一刻扮演救兵的角色。

With one last stroke and freeing herself of the lanyard that tethered her to the crane, Unit-01 dropped upon Unit-02, smashed through the last bulkhead and then made a huge splash on the lake of LCL that was in the center of Terminal Dogma.  
随着最后一击，零号机摆脱了系在起重机上的缆绳，猛地落在二号机上，撞破了最后的舱壁，然后在中央教条区中心的 LCL 湖中溅起巨大的水花。

"_I don't believe your nerve, young man," Kyoko muttered, as she found herself as an unwanted passenger in Unit-02, the Eva struggling against her officemate. "Where the hell are you two going this time?"_  
"我真佩服你的胆量，年轻人，" 绫波低声说道，发现自己成了二号机上不受欢迎的乘客，这台 EVA 正与她的同事对抗。"这次你们又要去哪儿？"

"To there," Kaworu said as he and Rei walked the last few hundred meters to the door leading into the chamber containing Lilith.  
"去那里，" 渚薰说着，他和绫波走完了通往存放莉莉丝的房间的最后几百米。

"_Schiessekopf, you're not kidding, don't you?" Kyoko questioned._  
"捣蛋鬼，你不是在开玩笑吧，嗯？" 绫子质疑道。

Kaworu nodded. "It's just part of the plan, so hang on right there," he said before turning to Rei, who was walking with him. "It has to be done," he added.  
薰点点头。"这只是计划的一部分，所以请坚持住，"他说完转向与他同行的丽，"这是必须做的，"他补充道。

"Is it necessary that my brother be hurt in such a way?" Rei doubted as they mounted the steel stairs leading to the chamber.  
"有必要让我哥哥受到这样的伤害吗？" 丽一边登上通往房间的钢制楼梯，一边怀疑地问道。

"We don't have much of a choice, but it's also another test," Kaworu replied once they confronted the steel door that kept out most intruders but only a select personages; a larger, massive door was besides it, built out of the strongest alloys possible, more than 80 meters tall and six meters thick, enough to fit an Eva to come inside.  
“我们别无选择，但这同时也是另一项考验，”面对着那扇阻挡大多数入侵者、仅对特定人物开放的钢铁大门，渚薰如此回应道。旁边还有一扇更大、更宏伟的门，由最坚固的合金打造，高达 80 米，厚达 6 米，足以容纳一台 EVA 进入。

Using telekinesis once more, Kaworu jimmied the lock internally, and the door slid open, before they walked into the chamber, to look and see Lilith in her full visage.  
渚薰再次运用心灵传动，从内部撬开了锁，大门缓缓滑开，他们步入室内，目睹了莉莉丝的全貌。

A grotesque creature, pale colored, and still dripping with LCL, Lilith was nailed to a primer-painted steel cross that was her prison for years. Her other half now has slowly growing legs extending out of her main body.  
这怪物肤色苍白，身上仍滴着 LCL 液体，被钉在一副涂有底漆的钢制十字架上，多年来一直是她的牢笼。她的另一半身体正缓慢长出双腿，向外延伸。

Seemingly lifeless, her multi-eyed mask stared down at the Children, as they walked closer and along the pool's edge.  
看似毫无生气，她那多眼的假面俯视着孩子们，他们沿着池边越走越近。

---

Left behind, Shinji and Unit-01 was still locked in combat, trying to get Unit-02 off from them. "Kaworu!" he gasped, landing more blows at the renegade opponent. "Come back here!"  
被留在原地的真嗣和初号机仍在战斗中，试图将二号机从身上甩开。“薰！”他喘息着，对叛变的对手施以更多打击。“回来这里！”

One hit made Unit-02 to loosen its grip on the Prog Knife's handle, dropping it onto the ground. But that Eva didn't gave up and gathered to jump upon Unit-01 with her remaining emergency energy supplies.  
一击使得二号机松开了对进度之刃的握持，任其坠地。但那台 EVA 并未放弃，而是聚集剩余的应急能量，准备跃向初号机。

"ARRRGH! That does it!" Shinji yelled before he threw at the red Eva's head the hardest punch he could muster by thought, and the heavy concussion finally shortened the antagonist's battery.  
"啊啊啊！够了！" 真嗣大喊一声，用尽全力向红色 EVA 的头部挥出他所能想象的最重一拳，强烈的冲击终于耗尽了对手的电池。

Without missing a beat, Unit-01 kicked away her inert enemy, got up on two feet and went after Kaworu.  
毫不迟疑，初号机一脚踢开她那无力的敌人，站稳双脚，紧追卡洛而去。

---

With Rei besides him, Kaworu stared up at Lilith and said, "So, this is her, after all."  
卡洛身边站着丽，他抬头凝视着莉莉丝，说道：“原来，这就是她。”

"Yes," Rei answered. "是的，" 丽回答道。

"She is different," Kaworu remarked. "Adam was our mother being, and those born from Adam will have to return to once more, even at the risk of annihilating all of humanity."  
"她与众不同，" 渚薰评论道。"亚当是我们的母体，那些由亚当所生者终将回归其源，即便这可能意味着全人类的毁灭。

The Fifth Children turned to Rei and added, "I wasn't supposed to do this, I made my promise but I really lied to everyone, even to you."  
第五适格者转向丽，补充道："我本不该这么做，我许下了承诺，但我确实欺骗了所有人，甚至包括你。

The girl was shedding tears silently, but Kaworu gently brushed her cheeks with his fingers to wipe them away.  
女孩默默流泪，但卡洛温柔地用手指轻拭她的脸颊，为她拭去泪水。

"Don't worry about me, but I have something in mind," he said. "I wanted to do something in such a way that we can all win."  
"别担心我，我有个主意，" 他说。"我想做一件事，让我们都能赢。"

"Are you going to merge with Lilith?" Rei asked.  
"你要和莉莉丝融合吗？" 丽问道。"

But without answering Kaworu levitated upward, rising until he was level with Lilith's face, hovering over the immense pool of LCL that she produced constantly.  
但没有回答，碇真嗣悬浮上升，直到与莉莉丝的脸平齐，悬停在她不断产生的巨大 LCL 池上方。

"You'll wait and see," he finally said, before they turned around to see the massive steel door being cut-welded and then Unit-01 kicked it in and stepped inside, Prog Knife in hand, making huge splashes as she waded into the lake.  
“你会等着看的，”他终于说道，随后他们转身看到那扇巨大的钢门被切割焊接，接着零号机一脚踢开它，手持程序刀步入其中，溅起巨大的水花，涉入湖中。

"I'm going to stop you myself!" Shinji declared as Kaworu, without making a struggle or evading away, allowed the purple Eva to wrap her hands around him, instantly imprisoning the Angel completely.  
“我要亲自阻止你！”真嗣宣告道，而渚薰并未挣扎或躲避，任由紫色 EVA 将他双手环绕，瞬间完全囚禁了使徒。

"Thank you," Kaworu said, smiling at the otherwise confused Shinji. "I wished you to keep Unit Two, or I would've lived with her."  
"谢谢你，" 渚薰微笑着对困惑的真嗣说。"我希望你保留二号机，否则我就会和她一起生活了。"

"I couldn't quite understand you," Shinji replied, feeling anguished. "You did nothing but you gave me this much trouble, and… what do you want?"  
"我没能完全理解你，" 真嗣回答，感到痛苦。"你什么都没做，却给我带来了这么多麻烦，而且…你到底想要什么？"

Kaworu sighed in resignation, and said, "If I die, only then I can be considered free, and you can have the chance to do more."  
渚薰叹了口气，无奈地说："如果我死了，只有那时我才能真正自由，而你也有机会做更多的事。"

"Please," Shinji said. "I gave you everything for you to understand me, and then… Why do you have to risk our friendship to lead me all the way to this end?"  
"求你了，" 真嗣说。"我给了你一切，希望你能理解我，然后…为什么你非得用我们的友谊冒险，把我引向这样的结局？"

"I'm sorry if I lied to you," Kaworu replied. "I lied because you wouldn't want to hear the truth about me and my nature, my mission and my objective."  
"如果我对你撒了谎，我很抱歉，" 渚薰回答道。"我撒谎是因为你不会想听到关于我和我的本质、我的使命以及我的目标的真相。"

Shinji couldn't say another word.  
真嗣说不出话来。

"But that's all changed," Kaworu went on. "The thing is, I want you to understand yourself, and you're supposed to know yourself, your strengths that have to be focused on, while your weaknesses must be dealt with and remedied."  
"但这一切都改变了，" 渚薰继续说道。"问题是，我希望你能理解自己，你应该了解自己，你的优势需要集中发挥，而你的弱点则必须被正视并加以改善。"

The Fifth Children looked down to see Rei, now on her knees and crying silently.  
第五适格者低头看到绫波，她现在跪在地上，无声地哭泣着。

"You see, you do have potential to save this world we all exist in, whether you like it or not," Kaworu continued. "The problem is that you're too reluctant to face the facts."  
“你看，你确实有拯救我们共同存在的这个世界的潜力，不管你喜不喜欢，”渚薰继续说道。“问题在于你太过犹豫，不愿面对现实。”

"No, I'm ready," Shinji said. "Yet this isn't what I wanted, or I expected."  
"不，我已经准备好了，" 真嗣说，"但这不是我想要的，也不是我所期待的。"

"Then you were quite mistaken in assuming that Angels are not of this world," Kaworu said, "and thus be destroyed. To assume is a mistake, and to not knowing your enemy without knowing yourself as well could spell the end of everything that you hold dear to."  
"那么你完全误解了，以为使徒不属于这个世界，" 渚薰说，"从而可以被摧毁。假设本身就是错误，而不了解敌人也不了解自己，可能会导致你所珍视的一切走向终结。"

The Third Children sighed, as he relaxed his grip on Kaworu. "I trusted you," he said, "I learned a few things from you, I understood what it takes to live and fight, yet… In the end you betrayed my trust, and everyone else's."  
第三适格者叹了口气，放松了对渚薰的抓握。"我信任你，" 他说，"我从你那里学到了一些东西，明白了生存和战斗的意义，然而…最终你背叛了我的信任，还有其他所有人的。"

"But why you're letting me go a bit?" Kaworu asked, noticing that Unit-01 gave less pressure on his body.  
“但你为何稍微放我一马呢？”渚薰问道，注意到初号机对他的压迫减轻了。

"I'm supposed to kill you, but… I feel I just can't do it," Shinji reluctantly said.  
“我本该杀了你，但是……我觉得我做不到，”真嗣不情愿地说。

"You have only one choice, my brother," Kaworu said, his eyes narrowing. "You'll have to kill me, or risk yourself destroying the human race. The life that escapes being annihilated, and obtains the future should be the one left standing."  
“你只有一个选择，我的兄弟，”渚薰说，眼神变得锐利。“你必须杀了我，否则就有可能毁灭人类。那些逃脱被消灭命运、获得未来的人，才是应该留下的。”

Shinji said nothing. 真嗣什么也没说。

"All of you deserve to exist onward," Kaworu continued. "So, at least I was able to enjoy two rewards in this end."  
"你们所有人都值得继续存在下去，" 渚薰继续说道。"所以，至少在这结局中，我得以享受了两次回报。"

Shinji peered at Rei below, still waiting for the inevitable, before focusing back at Kaworu. "Her, right?" he asked.  
真嗣低头看着下方的绫波，仍在等待那不可避免的时刻，然后重新注视着渚薰。"是她，对吧？" 他问道。

Kaworu sighed. "That's correct," he said. "I loved her for what she is, and filled in the emptiness that's been present in her heart for too long, and then I'm also glad that I was able to meet you."  
渚薰叹了口气。"没错，" 他说。"我爱她，因为她就是她，填补了她心中长久以来的空虚，同时我也庆幸能遇见你。"

"And…?" “然后呢？”

"Just like you," Kaworu continued, "in the days between the time I came here and now, at first I was indifferent, I knew nothing except for the task that was given, but then I met Rei."  
“就像你一样，”渚薰继续说道，“在我来到这里到现在的这些日子里，起初我漠不关心，只知道被赋予的任务，但后来我遇到了丽。”

"Go on," Shinji said.  
"继续吧," 真嗣说道。

"I've learned much from you and from our friends; I understood what it means to be a human being, what loves and hates that makes one tick from the time of birth, and how humans are formed into what they are, to affect the changes of this world no matter how insignificant some of them are. Above all, it became my task to help you give backbone so that you may have to face the last battle, and then I have to help the rest."  
"我从你和我们的朋友那里学到了很多；我明白了作为一个人意味着什么，爱与恨如何从出生那一刻起就驱动着我们，以及人类是如何被塑造成他们现在的样子，无论他们中的一些人多么微不足道，都能影响这个世界的变化。最重要的是，我的任务是帮助你坚强起来，让你能够面对最后的战斗，然后我还要帮助其他人。"

"Like Asuka, Misato…" Shinji trailed away.  
"像明日香，美里…" 真嗣的声音渐渐低了下去。

"By my touch, I saw the pain in Misato's heart... of loss and repressed grief owing to the death of Ryoji Kaji... Then there was you, feeling sad about what happened to Rei after she slain Brother Armisael in her last sortie."  
"通过我的触摸，我看到了美里心中的痛苦...因失去和压抑的悲伤，源于六分仪源堂的死...然后是你，为丽在最后一次出击中杀死阿米沙尔后发生的事情感到难过。"

Shinji blinked. "A... Armisael? You mean that all of you have names?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。 "阿...阿米沙尔？你是说你们都有名字吗？"

"Yes," Kaworu agreed, "That was his name, and so are my other Brethren, including me, and I took the name of Tabris; Armisael's mission was to free Rei's last predecessor from the bondage of your father."  
"是的，"渚薰同意道，"那是他的名字，我的其他兄弟们，包括我，都取了名字，我取名为塔布里斯；阿米沙尔的任务是解放你父亲束缚下的丽的最后一位前任。"

Rei silently nodded in acknowledgement.  
丽默默地点头表示认同。

"But there was a price to that," Kaworu continued, "which Rei had to pay with her sorrow that up until before I intervened, she had to cope with the pain of not remembering her past. So I made the fateful decision to help you all, to prepare you for the inevitable."  
"但这一切是有代价的，" 渚薰继续说道，"那就是绫波必须以她的悲伤为代价，直到我介入之前，她不得不忍受遗忘过去的痛苦。所以我做出了那个重大的决定，帮助你们所有人，为不可避免的未来做准备。"

"W... What about Asuka? Misato? And me?" Shinji questioned.  
"那...那明日香呢？美里呢？还有我呢？" 真嗣追问道。"

"Without any selfishness," Kaworu answered, "I gave my inner strength to try to help Asuka awaken from her self-destructive misery, and I also helped Misato to see beyond the pain and sorrow of her past, to bring her senses to face the future... But as for you, I wanted to see you overcome the weaknesses that could hinder your final battle."  
"没有任何私心，" 渚薰回答，"我将自己的内在力量用于试图帮助明日香从自我毁灭的痛苦中觉醒，我也帮助美里超越过去的痛苦和悲伤，让她能够面对未来... 至于你，我想看到你克服那些可能阻碍你最终战斗的弱点。"

"But, wait," Shinji asked. "You haven't told me about where you came from… and for whom do you work for?"  
"但是，等等，" 真嗣问道。"你还没告诉我你来自哪里…以及你为谁工作？"

Kaworu squinted for a moment and took a breath. "I came here by the orders given to me by the Committee, which your father was supposed to follow. But your father, Commander Ikari, has deviated from the plans of my superiors and, as a penalty for their displeasure towards your father, I was sent here and then foster confusion like a thief in the night."  
渚薰眯起眼睛，深吸了一口气。"我是奉委员会的命令来到这里的，你的父亲本应遵循这些命令。但你的父亲，碇司令，偏离了我上级的计划，作为对你父亲的不满的惩罚，我被派到这里，然后在暗中制造混乱，如同夜间的盗贼。"

"Just like what you're doing right now?" Shinji questioned. "Is that what they want, after all the trouble we had to endure, having dodged bullets, saw people die or those trying to kill us?"  
"就像你现在正在做的这样？" 真嗣质疑道。"这就是他们想要的吗，在我们经历了那么多磨难，躲避子弹，目睹人们死去或那些试图杀死我们的人之后？"

"It's not my goal to hurt you, but as much as I don't want this to happen, it must be done," Kaworu answered. "You're the one to effect a change here; you're the one to forge your own destiny, and you have the spotlight now, so if you erase me now, only then you'll be able to confront the danger that's being arrayed against all of you."  
"我的目的并非伤害你，但尽管我不希望这一切发生，它却必须完成，" 渚薰回答道。"你是这里带来改变的人；你是那个铸就自己命运的人，现在你站在聚光灯下，所以如果你现在抹去我，只有那时你才能面对正向你们所有人逼近的危险。"

Then they heard footfalls coming their way, before security troops began to pour through the door, arrayed themselves in a single file and readied their weapons, aimed squarely at Kaworu. Misato, Asuka and Tsutomo were the last to follow in, before stopping to gaze at Shinji's prisoner.  
随后他们听到了脚步声向他们靠近，紧接着安全部队开始涌入门内，排成一列并准备好武器，直指着渚薰。美里、明日香和筒本紧随其后，停下脚步凝视着真嗣的俘虏。

"Kaworu," Asuka mumbled, before her face transformed into rage. "Damn you, you fucking jackass, you should've told me that you're an Angel, for Chrissakes!" she yelled, her fist clenched upward. "What the hell happened with my Eva? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?"  
"渚薰，" 明日香低声说道，随即她的脸上转为愤怒。"该死的，你这个混蛋，你早该告诉我你是使徒，看在上帝的份上！" 她喊道，拳头紧握向上。"我的 Eva 到底怎么了？你到底做了什么？"

"I'm sorry," Kaworu sheepishly apologized as Rei walked towards the group and stood besides Misato. "I don't mean to... I just wanted a little spin with her."  
"对不起，" 渚不好意思地道歉，当丽走向人群并站在美里旁边时。"我不是故意的... 我只是想和她稍微转一圈。"

The redhead then trained her head to find Lilith in her crucified glory, and this shocked her to near-silence. "What the heck is that thing?"  
红发女孩随后转头寻找被钉在十字架上的莉莉丝，这一幕让她震惊得几乎说不出话来。"那是什么鬼东西？"

"Lilith," Misato said dryly. "I'll explain to you later."  
"莉莉丝，" 美里干巴巴地说。"我稍后会向你解释。"

Kaworu then returned his attention to Shinji, who was watching all of this. "Well, it seems that I've told you everything you wanted to know. Such a beautiful lie you fell for, and then… Thanks for the memories, my friend."  
碇真嗣看着这一切，渚薰又将注意力转回他身上。“好吧，看来我已经告诉你所有你想知道的。你竟相信了如此美丽的谎言，然后……谢谢你给我的回忆，我的朋友。”

"And what now?" the Third Children asked.  
“那现在呢？”第三适格者问道。

With nothing to answer, a bright halo of light began to issue forth from Kaworu, filling and overwhelming the chamber, causing everyone to shield with their hands and turn away from the white glare.  
无言以对之下，一道耀眼的光环从渚薰身上迸发，充斥并淹没了整个房间，迫使所有人用手遮挡并转过身去，避开那刺眼的白光。

"No!" Asuka loudly blurted, barely able to see that only Rei continued to stare at the blinding glow.  
"不！" 明日香大声脱口而出，几乎看不清只有绫波继续凝视着那刺眼的光芒。

"Kaworu..." Shinji whispered and closed his eyes, before he finally tightened his hand around the handle…  
"薰..." 真嗣低声呢喃，闭上了眼睛，最终紧紧握住了把手……

---

And then all of them heard the unearthly, bloody sound of squished flesh, followed by a small splash in the pool of LCL below.  
随后，他们听到了那令人毛骨悚然的、血肉被碾压的声音，紧接着是下方 LCL 池中轻微的溅水声。

---

Thousands of meters above and ensconced behind his desk, Gendo Ikari was keeping tabs on ongoing developments when he saw one of the operators stand up and reported, "AT-Field emissions are gone now, sir."  
数千米的上方，坐在办公桌后的碇源堂正关注着事态的发展，这时他看到一名操作员站起身来报告：“AT 力场的发射已经消失了，长官。”

"It means the Seventeenth Angel is now dead," Gendo said as the main display showed position markers where the surviving Eva was located. Deep within him, however, he was satisfied with the desired results of his plan, and thus he felt better and much confident.  
“这意味着第十七使徒已经死亡，”碇源堂说道，主显示屏上显示着幸存 EVA 的位置标记。然而，在他内心深处，他对计划的预期结果感到满意，因此他感到更加自信和安心。

"We've now reestablished contact with Unit-01," the operator added. "Should I make radio contact?"  
“我们现已重新与 01 号单位建立联系，”操作员补充道，“需要进行无线电联络吗？”

Gendo shook his head. "No, belay that," he commanded. "Instead, I recommend that a cleanup and containment team be deployed immediately."  
碇源堂摇了摇头。“不，取消那个，”他命令道，“我建议立即部署清理和封锁小组。”

The operator nodded, before he returned to his console and began to make phone calls, and Gendo returned himself to the usual "thinking" position.  
操作员点头后回到控制台开始打电话，而碇源堂则恢复了他惯常的“思考”姿态。

---

On the other hand, back in Siberia, Keel and the rest of the Committee heard of the news confirming Kaworu's demise, after their satellites no longer detected any AT-Field emissions, followed by succession of radio transmission intercepts.  
另一方面，在西伯利亚，基尔和他的委员会成员们得知了确认渚薰死亡的消息，他们的卫星不再检测到任何 AT 力场辐射，随后是一系列无线电传输拦截。

"The final Angel has accomplished his mission," Evgenyi said. "He did just according to our schedule."  
“最后的使徒完成了他的使命，”叶甫根尼说，“他完全按照我们的计划行事。”

Keel nodded in satisfaction. He then said, "Ikari was such a good friend and brother, sharing the same purpose; our collaborator who understood us. The last task has been accomplished, thanks to his son and Unit One."  
基尔满意地点头。然后他说：“碇真嗣是一个好朋友和兄弟，与我们有着相同的目标；理解我们的合作者。多亏了他的儿子和初号机，最后的任务已经完成。”

The old man then turned to the rest of the council. "Now that the Seventeenth Angel is dead, let us make ourselves ready for our final and greatest work," Keel said. "There will be no ultimatum, no hiding this time; there will be no shelter or escape, for the way is fixed and cannot be changed. No quarter shall be spared, nor time be wasted."  
老人随即转向议会的其他成员。“既然第十七使徒已死，让我们为最终也是最伟大的事业做好准备，”基尔说。“这次不会有最后通牒，也不会有隐藏；没有庇护所或逃脱之路，因为道路已定，无法改变。不留余地，不浪费时间。”

The other members murmured in delight, as though they were awaiting the grand banquet prepared before them, ready to be consumed.  
其他成员欣喜地低声议论，仿佛他们正等待着摆在他们面前即将享用的大餐。

But Keel had other things in mind, so he upraised his hand. "Brethren," he announced. "May I have your attention?"  
但基尔心中另有打算，于是他举起手。“兄弟们，”他宣布道。“请听我说？”

That shut everyone up, as they readied to listen, thus satisfying Keel's need for an audience.  
这话让所有人都安静下来，他们准备好聆听，满足了基尔需要观众的需求。

"I would like to bring you all to see what else we will unleash," the old man said.  
“我想带你们去看看我们还将释放什么，”老人说道。

"And what are you talking about, Master?" one of them asked, quite unsure as to what other surprises their leader had in mind.  
“您在说什么呢，师父？”其中一人问道，对于领袖心中还有哪些惊喜颇为不确定。

"Come instead," Keel said as he stood up, preparing to walk away. "I have a triumvirate who shall give us our ultimate victory."  
"你来吧，" 基尔说道，站起身准备离开。"我有三位统领，他们将带给我们最终的胜利。"

When the great flare of light died out, Shinji slowly turned the hand of Unit-01 to face him, and he was greeted by a huge covering of blood painted upon its palm, dripping in rivulets. Disgusted, Shinji then winced from that sight, turning his head away. He collapsed back to the headrest, and tried to think as he recovered himself from the ordeal he'd just endured.  
当那耀眼的光芒消逝后，真嗣缓缓转动初号机的手面向自己，只见手掌上覆盖着厚厚一层血迹，血滴如细流般滴落。真嗣感到一阵恶心，皱眉别过头去。他瘫倒在座椅上，努力平复刚刚经历的磨难，试图理清思绪。

_Mother,_ he thought, blinking. _I've just killed my best friend, but I didn't have much of a choice, right?_  
母亲，他眨眼间思索着。我刚刚杀了我最好的朋友，但我别无选择，对吧？

**Author's Notes:** This chapter was done in a space of two days, and it's fortunate that I have a single draft for this one, a snippet, really, and let's see… That "idea" file was back in June 16, 2004, and that was a long time ago, when I was starting on this story, back when I had a computer for which to use, and often I would find myself awake all night, brimming with ideas before committing them into pages and pages…  
作者笔记：这一章节在两天内完成，幸运的是我有一份初稿，其实只是个片段。让我们看看……那个“灵感”文件是在 2004 年 6 月 16 日，那是很久以前，当我刚开始写这个故事时，那时我有一台电脑可以使用，我常常整夜不眠，思如泉涌，然后将这些想法倾注于一页页的文字中……

The title was from a 30 Seconds to Mars song, which was appropriate to set the emotional tone of this chapter, and I've come to greatly appreciate their music ever since I brought that album.  
标题取自 30 秒到火星乐队的一首歌，非常适合为本章设定情感基调，自从我买了那张专辑以来，我对他们的音乐越来越欣赏。

Looking forward, there's one last chapter to go to conclude this season, and I think the title "Aftermath" is also appropriate, and afterwards, hell's about to break loose.  
展望未来，这个季度还有最后一章即将完结，我认为标题“余波”同样恰如其分，之后，地狱即将爆发。

Until then, thank you and good evening.  
在此之前，感谢大家，祝大家晚安。

_J'ai ose. 我敢了。_

### Chapter 40 Aftermath

_**Gabriel:**_ _Have you ever heard of Harry Houdini? Well he wasn't like today's magicians who are only interested in television ratings. He was an artist. He could make an elephant disappear in the middle of a theater filled with people, and do you know how he did that?_ Misdirection.  
加布里埃尔：你听说过哈里·胡迪尼吗？他可不像现在的魔术师只关心电视收视率。他是个艺术家。他能让一头大象在挤满人的剧院中央消失，你知道他是怎么做到的吗？靠的是误导。

_**Stanley:**_ _What the fuck are you talking about?_  
斯坦利：你他妈在说什么鬼话？

_**Gabriel:**_ _Misdirection. What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes._  
加布里埃尔：误导。眼睛看到的，耳朵听到的，大脑就会相信。

Misato Katsuragi watched the investigators move about as they picked up and bagged most of Kaworu's personal effects inside his miniscule room, before consigning them to a pair of large carts parked outside his quarters. The entire section of the BOQ was completely off-limits and guarded by armed security troopers; once they were done with the forensics work would they seal the room's door with crime scene tape.  
葛城美里看着调查人员在川濑的狭小房间内四处走动，将他的大部分个人物品捡起并装袋，然后将它们装上停在他宿舍外的一对大推车上。整个 BOQ 区域完全禁止入内，并由武装安全部队守卫；一旦他们完成法医工作，就会用犯罪现场封条封住房间的门。

One thought had preoccupied her completely: she wondered if Kaworu's plan had _actually_ worked, but then she and many others were already witness to his demise, right before their very eyes, which means that his scheme, whatever it was, had failed.  
一个念头完全占据了她的思绪：她想知道川濑的计划是否真的成功了，但她和许多其他人已经亲眼目睹了他的死亡，这意味着他的计划，无论是什么，都失败了。

Misato sighed and concluded that Kaworu Nagisa was indeed dead.  
美里叹了口气，断定碇真嗣确实已经死了。

A Second Section agent was busy documenting each of the bags as they were placed inside the carts, before another agent came out of the door, carrying a large envelope in his hands. They talked for a moment, and then afterwards the agent with the envelope approached Misato.  
一名第二分部的特工正忙着记录每个袋子放入推车的情况，这时另一名特工从门里走出来，手里拿着一个大信封。他们交谈了一会儿，随后拿着信封的特工走向美里。

"Pardon me, Colonel, but I thought you might want this," the agent said, showing the parcel to her.  
“打扰一下，上校，我想您可能需要这个，”特工说着，将包裹展示给她看。

Misato blinked. "This is for me? Why?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“这是给我的？为什么？”

The agent handed to her the envelope, and she examined the black kanji written on it with a thin felt-tip marker. "It has your name on it, ma'am, so I think it might be very important."  
特工递给她一个信封，她仔细端详着上面用细毡尖笔写着的黑色汉字。“上面有您的名字，女士，我想这可能非常重要。”

"Thank you," Misato said. "Do I need to return this to you afterwards?"  
“谢谢，”美里说道。“我之后需要还给你吗？”

"It'll be up to you," the agent replied. "Yours is really personal unless you want it to be used as evidence in our investigation."  
"这取决于你，"特工回答道。"除非你想用它作为我们调查的证据，否则这完全是你的个人物品。"

Misato thought for a moment, and then she replied, "I'll keep it. Again, thank you."  
美里想了一会儿，然后回答说："我会保留它。再次感谢你。"

"Sure, no problem, ma'am," the agent replied before going back inside the room.  
"当然，没问题，女士，"特工回答后回到了房间里。"

As she walked away, the guard on the perimeter allowing her to pass through the barricade, Misato used her fingers to feel the contents of the envelope, which turned out to be containing a jewelcase for a compact disc.  
当她走开时，外围的守卫让她通过了路障，美里用手指摸索着信封里的内容，结果发现里面是一张 CD 的珠宝盒。

Misato wondered if Kaworu had something more for her to tell, even after Shinji killed him; did it concern about his tragic role in this scheme, or was it more personal?  
美里想知道，即使真嗣杀了他之后，渚薰是否还有更多的话要告诉她；这是关于他在这一计划中的悲剧角色，还是更私人的事情？

"Colonel, are you there?" Hamamoto asked. "Can you copy?"  
“上校，您在吗？” 滨本问道。“能收到吗？”

Misato's radio broke the silence that came with their horrified astonishment, after witnessing the flash of light issuing from Kaworu shortly before Unit-01 crushed him with full force of her hand; at the moment, the right hand of the Eva was covered in blood and flecks of flesh and bone, with some falling into the pool of LCL.  
在目睹了从渚薰身上发出的光芒后，碇真嗣的初号机以全力将他碾碎，随之而来的死寂被美里手中的无线电打破；此刻，EVA 的右手沾满了血迹、肉块和碎骨，有些落入了 LCL 池中。

"Do you read me, over?" Hamamoto queried once more.  
“能听到吗，完毕？”滨本再次询问道。

They were all transfixed at the gore splashed over her hand, before Misato blinked, took the time to return her weapon to its holster, got the radio in her hand from the belt, and pressed the talk button.  
他们都被她手上溅满的血腥场面所震撼，直到美里眨了眨眼，将武器收回枪套，从腰带上取下无线电，按下了通话键。

"I'm here. Go ahead, sir," Misato replied.  
"我在这里。请讲，先生，" 美里回答道。

"What's your status?" "你的情况如何？"

"We're okay, and it's over. Everything's under control, even Unit One."  
"我们没事，已经结束了。一切都在掌控之中，包括初号机。"

"And what happened to Nagisa?"  
"那么渚怎么样了？"

Misato hesitated for a second or two. "He's dead," she answered, "I repeat, he's dead."  
美里犹豫了一两秒。“他死了，”她回答道，“我再说一遍，他死了。”

"I copy that, Colonel," Hamamoto said. "By the way, containment and recovery crews are heading your way; they'll have to clean up and then haul the Evas back to where they came."  
"明白了，上校，" 浜本说。“顺便说一下，封锁和回收小组正在前往你们那里；他们得清理现场，然后把 Eva 运回原处。”

"Who sent them?" Misato asked, frowning.  
“谁寄来的？”美里皱着眉头问道。

"Ikari, but as far as we're concerned he doesn't have any clue about us," the old man responded. "Furthermore, Morrissey has yet to report back to him."  
"碇，但就我们所知，他对我们的情况一无所知，"老人回答道。"而且，莫里森尼尚未向他汇报。"

Misato glanced at the two Children standing besides her, together in an embrace, with Asuka providing Rei a shoulder to rest on. She then glanced up to Unit-01, and tried to picture as to what Shinji was doing onboard.  
美里瞥了一眼站在她身边的两个孩子，他们紧紧相拥，明日香为绫波提供了一个依靠的肩膀。她随后抬头望向初号机，试图想象真嗣在驾驶舱内的情景。

---

Inside and even immersed in LCL, the young man had his face in both palms, before letting them run over his hair. In frustration, Shinji then clenched his teeth, his fist hammering on the right thigh, and feeling anguished at what he did, but trying not to lash out; even the LCL that he breathed in and out tasted bitter on his tongue.  
在 LCL 中，年轻人双手捂着脸，随后手指穿过头发。沮丧之下，真嗣紧咬牙关，拳头捶打着右腿，对自己所做之事感到痛苦，却努力不让自己爆发出来；就连他呼吸的 LCL，在他口中也尝起来苦涩。

His best friend was now dead, having admitted that he was sent by a cabal of old men to disrupt them all, if not bring about the end of the world.  
他最好的朋友如今已死，临终前坦白自己是被一群老头派来破坏他们所有人，甚至可能引发世界末日的。

It was a very painful realization that of all the opponents he dealt with in the past, it was Kaworu who brought the most damage to him, because he had to kill him; because he was an Angel and could come in contact with that creature called Adam.  
最让他痛苦的认识是，在他过去面对的所有对手中，正是渚薰给他带来了最大的伤害，因为他不得不杀了他；因为他是一个天使，能够接触到那个被称为亚当的生物。

Shinji glanced at the power meter to the left side of the HUD; he still had 6 minutes of power left in the external battery pack, plus another five for the internal batteries inside Unit-01, before he heard Misato's voice on the radio.  
真嗣瞥了一眼 HUD 左侧的电量指示器；外部电池包还剩 6 分钟电量，再加上初号机内部电池的 5 分钟，这时他听到了美里通过无线电传来的声音。

"Shinji? Can you hear me, over?" Misato asked. "Hello?"  
"真嗣？你能听到我吗，在吗？" 美里问道。"喂？"

"I… I'm here," he said.  
"我……我在，" 他说道。"

"Are you feeling okay?"  
"你感觉还好吗？"

The young man nodded instinctively. "Yeah… No, I'm disgusted at what I did."  
年轻人本能地点了点头。"是的……不，我对自己所做的事感到厌恶。"

"What?" "什么？"

"I said I feel sick about what I did! I KILLED HIM!" Shinji exclaimed.  
"我说了我对我所做的事感到恶心！我杀了他！" 真嗣喊道。

"We talked about this before, all right?' Misato replied with an angered voice. "Why the hell you're—"  
"我们之前讨论过这个，好吗？' 美里用愤怒的声音回答。"你他妈的为什么——"

"He said 'I love you' to me! Like he was a brother to me! Just like me, just like Ayanami, and I heard those words for the first time and… God, he was someone whom I would consider as my brother! He should've been the one to survive, not me!"  
"他对我说‘我爱你’！就像他是我的兄弟一样！就像我，就像绫波一样，我第一次听到那些话，而且……天啊，他是我会视为兄弟的人！他本该是活下来的那个，不是我！"

Misato let out a frustrated groan.  
美里发出了一声沮丧的呻吟。

"Fuck that, kid," she replied. "A survivor possesses the will to survive, and in Kaworu's case it was his choice to die. Can't you see that you did the right thing?"  
"去他妈的，孩子，"她回答道。"幸存者拥有求生的意志，而真嗣的情况是他选择了死亡。你难道看不出来你做的是正确的事吗？"

Shinji managed a hard lump in his throat. "You… You sound cold."  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。“你……你听起来很冷漠。”

"Of course I have to!" Misato retorted. "You think this is a joke? You think what happened here is a joke? SNAP OUT OF IT!"  
“我当然得这样！”美里反驳道，“你以为这是开玩笑吗？你以为这里发生的事是开玩笑吗？清醒点！”

Not wanting to hear more of her, Shinji abruptly shut off the radio and reclined back onto his seat.  
不想再听她多说，真嗣突然关掉了收音机，向后靠在座位上。

---

In frustration, Misato sat on the sand and silently cursed herself, laying the radio besides her. For a moment she looked at the motionless Unit-01, before moving on to the crucified figure of Lilith, still undisturbed and leaking LCL.  
在沮丧中，美里坐在沙滩上，默默地咒骂着自己，将无线电放在身旁。她先是看了一会儿静止不动的初号机，随后目光转向被钉在十字架上的莉莉丝，依旧未受打扰，LCL 缓缓渗出。

"Survivor's guilt?" Tsutomo asked as he squatted down.  
“幸存者的愧疚？”筒友问着蹲了下来。

"Yeah," Misato answered. "I should've known that he's a sensitive boy."  
“嗯，”美里回答，“我早该知道他是个敏感的孩子。”

Just then Sasaki approached them. "Do you have anything else for us to do?"  
就在这时，佐佐木向他们走来。“你们还有什么任务要交给我们吗？”

Tsutomo turned to face him. "Yeah, secure the perimeter until the crew comes."  
堤文雄转过身面对他。“有，在工作人员到来之前确保周边安全。”

Sasaki nodded. "Okay," he said before he left to gesture the rest of the party to brief them and then carry out their orders.  
佐佐木点头。“好的，”他说完便离开，向其他队员简要说明情况，然后执行命令。

Once they were alone, Misato began to talk again.  
一旦他们独处，美里又开始说话了。

"I should've known that he's been so tight with Kaworu on a personal level," she said. "You know, he was deprived of much love and affection that… this turned out to be too hard for him."  
“我早该知道他和卡罗之间的关系已经那么亲密了，”她说，“你知道，他从小就缺乏爱和关怀……这对他来说太难承受了。”

"I don't know if this'll work," Tsutomo said, "but let him think over about it… No, you two will have to talk over this matter. That kid needs an outlet, no matter how you think it's hard for you to hear."  
“我不知道这会不会有用，”筒本说，“但让他好好想想……不，你们俩得谈谈这件事。那孩子需要一个发泄的出口，不管你觉得这对你来说有多难接受。”

Misato nodded. "I see."  
美里点头。"我明白了。"

"Guilt, as I understand it, tends to paralyze anyone, especially after committing something wrong, or he or she thinks he did the wrong thing. In this case, without Kaworu to turn to, Shinji still needs you to listen because you're the only one he trusts."  
"在我看来，罪恶感往往会让人瘫痪，尤其是在做了错事或自认为做了错事之后。在这种情况下，没有了加持可以依靠，真嗣仍然需要你倾听，因为你才是他唯一信任的人。"

"Me?"

"Yeah, because you're more than his commanding officer; you're really much of an elder sister to him, what without a mother and a father for him."  
"是啊，因为你不仅仅是他的指挥官；你对他来说更像是一个姐姐，毕竟他没有母亲和父亲。"

"I admit that I've never dealt with something like this difficult before," she said. "I mean, I wasn't much of the therapist type. Instead, what I do is to try cheering up people when they're down, and I'm supposed to do that… Yet…"  
"我承认，我从未处理过如此棘手的问题，" 她说道。"我的意思是，我并不是那种典型的治疗师。我通常是在人们情绪低落时，尝试让他们振作起来，这是我应该做的……然而……"

"If you couldn't do it, maybe I'll help," Tsutomo said.  
"如果你做不到，或许我可以帮忙，" 筒友说。

"You?" "你？"

"Yeah, I've been through this before, as a cop, before I came here."  
"是的，我以前经历过类似的情况，作为一名警察，在我来到这里之前。"

"What did you do?"  
"你做了什么？"

The agent sighed. "We once had a rape case," he said. "The girl, having been worked over, wanted to kill herself, but I told her that she needs to overcome that guilt trip, and that life is still worth living for. I then explained to her that the best thing she should be glad is being alive and in good hands, the bastard who raped her is behind bars, and all she can do is to start over again with a clean slate."  
特工叹了口气。“我们曾处理过一起强奸案，”他说，“那个女孩遭受了摧残，想要自杀，但我告诉她，她需要克服那种负罪感，生活依然值得继续。我向她解释，她最应该庆幸的是自己还活着，并且得到了妥善照顾，那个强奸她的混蛋已经被关进监狱，她所能做的就是重新开始，一切从头再来。”

"And did it work?"  
“那有用吗？”

"She admitted it wasn't easy taking my advice, but she would try, along with a few sessions with a psychiatrist. Yet, in this case we can do it, and help it along with some tea."  
“她承认接受我的建议并不容易，但她会尝试，同时配合几次心理咨询。不过，在这个案例中，我们可以做到，并且可以通过一些茶来帮助她。”

"I see," Misato said. "But I feel that he's still thinking it over."  
"我明白了，"美里说。"但我觉得他还在考虑。"

"But—" “但是——”

"It's best for us to leave him alone for a while."  
"我们最好暂时让他一个人待会儿。"

---

In his seat, Shinji was fuming, this time blaming his father for pushing him into this morass of his making, into this world he didn't want to be involved with in the first place. He blamed himself; he wished he was back to where he came from, to think none of this business, much of it almost having himself killed.  
坐在座位上的真嗣此刻怒火中烧，这次他将责任归咎于父亲，认为是他将自己推入了这个自找的泥潭，推入了这个他原本就不想涉足的世界。他也在自责；他希望回到原来的地方，不去想这些事情，其中许多差点让他丧命。

_Mother,_ he pondered, _why it has to be me? Why?  
母亲，他沉思着，为何非得是我？为什么？  
No, you must be waiting for me to be here. For what good, what purpose?  
不，你一定是在等我到这里。为了什么好处，什么目的？  
I killed him. 我杀了他。  
I had no choice. 我别无选择。_

In his mind's eye he saw Rei standing before him. _He was a human like me._  
在他的脑海中，他看到丽站在他面前。他和我是同类人。

_No! He was an Angel! I have to kill or everyone would've been killed!  
不！他是使徒！我必须杀了他，否则所有人都会被杀！  
I didn't want to kill him, yet… I had no choice.  
我不想杀他，然而……我别无选择。  
What should I do? 我该怎么办？  
Mother, what should I do?  
母亲，我该怎么办？_

_Are you afraid of something? What do you fear?_ The Rei in his mind asked.  
你在害怕什么？你恐惧的是什么？他心中的丽问道。  
_What? Me? Yeah, I fear being disliked.  
什么？我？是啊，我害怕被讨厌。  
By whom? 被谁？_

The dim outline of his father appeared in the distance, his face hidden by shadows, save for the glint of his eyeglasses.  
远处隐约浮现出他父亲的轮廓，面容隐于暗影之中，唯有一副眼镜闪着微光。

_Father abandoned me!_ _That's why I fear being disliked! To be hated! This isn't what I wanted!_  
父亲抛弃了我！这就是我害怕被讨厌的原因！被憎恨！这不是我想要的！

Shinji took a deep breath, as if to center himself from the nauseating sensation he still had in his stomach, and then thought of this machine of war, this unforgiving purple Angel eater who never gave or took any quarter.  
真嗣深吸一口气，仿佛要从胃里翻腾的不适感中稳住自己，然后想起了这台战争机器，这个无情吞噬使徒的紫色天使，从不给予也不接受任何怜悯。

_I have to pilot this_ _damned thing, after all, killing the one who I loved, the one who called me as his brother, obeying the words from my father and everyone else.  
毕竟，我得驾驶这该死的东西，杀死我爱的人，那个称我为兄弟的人，遵从父亲和所有人的命令。  
You say I have to fight in this?  
你说我必须参与这场战斗？  
Mom! Say something! ANSWER ME!  
妈妈！说点什么！回答我！_

There was nothing but silence for a few moments, before the Rei in his imagination appeared once more, confronting him.  
沉默持续了几秒钟，随后他想象中的零再次出现，直面他。

_Why do you pilot?_ She asked. _You became one of the Children for the sake of others?_  
你为什么要驾驶？她问。你成为孩子们的一员是为了别人吗？

_That's right, I do this so that I can be praised, I can feel happy, I have nothing to worry about, and for so long I never had praise from anyone else until now.  
没错，我这么做是为了得到赞扬，感到快乐，无忧无虑，而且这么长时间以来，直到现在我才从别人那里得到赞扬。  
But…  
How and what would they say about me, now that I have killed? Misato said I did the right thing, but…  
现在我杀了人，他们会怎么说我？美里说我做得对，但是…_

_This,_ Shinji finally told himself in resignation, _I was fated to be here. I cannot escape fate, and here I am, having killed someone who was a brother to me.  
最终，真嗣无奈地告诉自己，我注定要在这里。我无法逃脱命运，而我就在这里，杀死了曾是我的兄弟的人。  
His blood is on my hands.  
他的血在我手上。  
I killed Angels but not…  
我杀过天使，但不是……  
No.  
I have killed before. 我以前杀过人。  
Terrorists who tried to kill us all, like I was living in a video game, except with real explosions and other people dying before my eyes, and I killed those bad guys.  
那些试图杀死我们所有人的恐怖分子，就像我生活在电子游戏里一样，只不过是真实的爆炸和其他人在我眼前死去，而我杀了那些坏人。  
Because they wanted to kill Asuka.  
因为他们想要杀死明日香。  
And Misato. 还有美里。  
And me. 还有我。_

He then remembered the first and only time he and Kaworu took a bath as brothers; the memory of it this time calmed him.  
然后他想起了他和渚薰唯一一次作为兄弟共浴的情景；这次回忆让他平静下来。

_You told me about the guilt of killing and betrayal, right? I can remember now… even the words as we talked about it.  
你曾跟我谈及杀戮与背叛的罪恶，对吧？我现在能记起来了……就连我们谈论时的那些话语。_

Shinji flashed back to that moment when he asked about betrayal:  
真嗣回想起那个时刻，他询问关于背叛的问题：

"_W__hat would you do if you were betrayed? Or someone lied against you? What would you do?" Kaworu asked as he stared at his friend._  
“如果你被背叛了，或者有人对你撒谎，你会怎么做？” 渚薰凝视着他的朋友问道。

"_I… I don't know," Shinji replied, not feeling sure. "Maybe it depends on who's betraying or lying at me."_  
"我…我不知道，" 真嗣回答，心里并不确定。"或许这取决于谁在背叛或对我撒谎。"

"_But then, what if the betrayal or the lie is severe, so severe that it would even cost a life or many lives?"_  
"但如果背叛或谎言非常严重，严重到甚至会牺牲一条生命或许多生命呢？"

"_I guess… I think I would get back at the liar or the traitor, because he's responsible for making me do what I don't want to do."_  
"我想…我会报复那个说谎者或背叛者，因为他让我做了我不想做的事。"

"_And what if it's too late?"_  
"但如果已经太迟了呢？"

"_I'll blame myself for believing in the lie," he replied. "I would feel responsible for that mistake."_  
"我会怪自己相信了那个谎言，""他回答道。""我会为那个错误感到自责。"

The young man let out a groan of disappointment. _I believed in the lie he made, yet he… he made it so real that I've mistaken his words as truth.  
年轻人失望地发出一声呻吟。我曾相信他编织的谎言，然而他……他让那谎言如此逼真，以至于我将他的话误认为真相。  
I was such a fool.  
我真是个傻瓜。  
A fool… 一个傻瓜……_

Suddenly, in his mind's sight, Asuka appeared before him and then without hesitation, she slapped him across the face.  
突然间，在他的脑海中，明日香出现在他面前，随即毫不犹豫地给了他一记耳光。

_You i__diot! You're living a lie,_ she yelled at him._  
你这个白痴！你活在谎言里，她对他大喊。  
What the hell do you mean?  
你到底是什么意思？  
That's right, dummy! It's for your own sake!  
没错，傻瓜！这都是为了你好！  
Huh?  
But you tend to make too many excuses, and to think you're doing this for the sake of others is itself an easy way to live.  
但你总是找太多借口，认为这样做是为了别人，本身就是一种轻松的生活方式。  
Is that so? 是这样吗？  
You're lonely, you're nothing but in a dependent, symbiotic relationship, and all you want is people to depend on you, waiting for someone to bring you happiness. False happiness, that is, idiot!_  
你孤独，你不过是处于一种依赖共生的关系中，你想要的只是有人依赖你，等待某人给你带来幸福。那种虚假的幸福，就是了，傻瓜！

**FLASH! 闪光！**

Shinji felt he was no longer in the Entry Plug; his mind could be somewhere, but preoccupied completely with the guilt, and he looked down at his hands, bathed in crimson.  
真嗣感觉自己已不在插入栓内；他的意识可能在某处，但完全被罪恶感占据，他低头看着自己的双手，浸在鲜红之中。

_Am_ _I happy with this? LOOK AT ME!_ He screamed. _I have blood, his blood in my hands! And would I wake up without thinking about it? Something to get me out of this nightmare?_  
我对这满意吗？看看我！他尖叫道。我手上沾着他的血！我能否醒来而不去想它？有什么能让我摆脱这场噩梦吗？

_It has to be you who must find the way out.  
必须是你找到出路。_

Shinji turned around to find a boy ten years younger than him, his self at the exact time when his father left him behind in a train station: striped shirt, shorts, rubber sandals and tears.  
真嗣转过身，发现一个比他小十岁的男孩，正是他父亲离开他在火车站时的自己：条纹衬衫，短裤，橡胶凉鞋和泪水。

No, he wasn't crying this time.  
不，这次他没有哭。

_But… Where should I start? Where should I go?  
但是……我该从哪里开始？我该去往何方？_

This time they were in a train, the same train he rode on, an old express train that was one of the few left in working condition after Second Impact, and he could hear the clakety-clack of the wheels rolling over the expansion gaps in the rails, and then the occasional two-tone wail of the crossing bell.  
这次他们在火车上，同一辆火车，他曾经乘坐过的那辆老式特快列车，在第二次冲击后，这是少数几辆还能正常运行的列车之一。他能听到车轮在轨道接缝处发出的咔嗒咔嗒声，以及偶尔响起的道口铃声，那是一种双音的哀鸣。

Sitting together, the younger Shinji stared at his older counterpart. _The way out must start from within you, and if you want escape, the answer is not to run away but to face it. Deal with it. Take control of yourself. Don't let the guilt bring you back to where you were once used to be, for there's no turning back._  
坐在一起，年轻的真嗣盯着他的年长版本。出路必须从你内心开始，如果你想逃离，答案不是逃避而是面对。处理它。掌控自己。不要让愧疚将你带回曾经习惯的地方，因为那里没有回头路。

The older Shinji blinked. _That's all I have to do?_  
年长的真嗣眨了眨眼。我就这么办？

_Yeah. You're alive, you have all of your senses and limbs intact, and you also have a mind of your own, so get up on your feet.  
是的。你还活着，感官和四肢都完好无损，你还有自己的思想，所以站起来吧。_

_What about Kaworu? 那渚薰呢？_

_Him? His death is necessary, no matter how much you think you killed him, for not everything comes at a happy ending, and sacrifices must be done no matter how much the cost.  
他？无论你觉得自己杀了他多少次，他的死都是必要的，因为并非所有故事都有美满结局，牺牲在所难免，无论代价多大。_

_Even with his life? 即使是以他的生命为代价？_

The younger Shinji nodded. _That's right. He gave you a choice, whether to let him live or let you and the rest of humanity live, and you acted on the latter because he was about to do something._  
年轻的真嗣点了点头。没错。他给了你一个选择，是让他活下去还是让你和全人类活下去，你选择了后者，因为他即将做出某些事情。

_Like that flash of light?  
就像那道闪光一样？_

_Yes._

_I had to, because that's when he decided to destroy us all before I could bring myself to answer his question.  
我不得不这么做，因为就在那时，他决定在我回答他的问题之前毁灭我们所有人。_

_And why you're still feeling guilty about it?  
而你为何仍对此感到内疚？_

_Because he's the best thing I ever had, the only friend I trusted… and I killed him.  
因为他是我拥有过最美好的存在，唯一信任的朋友……而我却杀了他。_

The younger Shinji glowered at him this time, standing right before him. _Get over it._  
这次，年轻的真嗣瞪着他，就站在他面前。别再纠结了。

_What?_

_You're wasting your time moping. Since you're a warrior, you're not supposed to think too much of the guilt of slaying the man who honored you once, for he gave you the opportunity to honor his memory by killing him.  
你这样自怨自艾只是在浪费时间。既然身为战士，就不该过多沉溺于杀死曾敬重你的人的罪恶感中，因为他给了你机会，通过杀他来缅怀他的记忆。_

_For Kaworu__,_ the younger Shinji continued, _that would be the best gift he can have from you, for he wanted to be free, and that's his way out, and since you're alive, you also have the opportunity to find your own freedom._  
对小真嗣来说，这将是他最希望从你那里得到的礼物，因为他渴望自由，而这是他的出路，既然你还活着，你也有机会找到自己的自由。

_I do?_

_That's right. Every person wants a way out, until he or she is satisfied and all desires fulfilled, but not all avenues of escape are good; if you don't have a conscience, if you have no hope, chances are you'll kill yourself by your own hand, a cruel waste of life.  
没错。每个人都渴望一条出路，直到他或她感到满足，所有欲望都得到满足，但并非所有逃避的方式都是好的；如果你没有良心，如果你没有希望，很可能会亲手结束自己的生命，这是一种残酷的生命浪费。_

And Shinji had a vision: it was nighttime at their apartment; Asuka walked into his room, dressed in her yellow shirt and light-blue shorts, expecting him to prepare to make dinner when she found him hanging from the ceiling, rope tied around his neck.  
而真嗣眼前浮现了一幕：夜幕降临在他们公寓；明日香走进他的房间，身着黄色衬衫和浅蓝色短裤，本以为他会准备做饭，却见他悬挂在天花板上，绳索绕颈。

Shocked by this display of death, Asuka screamed, her piercing shriek causing him to obliterate the vision by blinking twice.  
这死亡的展示让明日香惊骇万分，她尖叫起来，那刺耳的尖叫声使他眨眼间便粉碎了这幻象。

_That's not me! 那不是我！_

_Of course that's not you,_ the younger Shinji reminded him. _That kind of scenario can happen if you were to degenerate into a hopeless wreck, but right now you have to credit yourself that there are still many people out there willing to help you, just as you tried to help them, for you're responsible, and also they're responsible for everything you do._  
当然那不是你，年轻的真嗣提醒他。那种情况只会在你堕落成无可救药的废人时发生，但此刻你必须相信，还有许多人愿意帮助你，正如你曾试图帮助他们一样，因为你负有责任，他们也对你所做的一切负有责任。

_And these same people that you give hope to, are also the ones providing whatever hope they have for you, so they're precious, just as your life is valuable.  
而这些你给予希望的人，同样也在用他们仅有的希望支持着你，所以他们是宝贵的，正如你的生命一样珍贵。_

_So I have to be hopeful, right?  
所以我必须保持希望，对吧？_

The younger Shinji grinned. _That's right,_ he said. _To hope is to live, no matter how hard the circumstances, no matter where you are, even if you have the spotlight shining right on you._  
年轻的真嗣咧嘴笑了。没错，他说。希望即是生存，无论环境多么艰难，无论身处何地，即便聚光灯正打在你身上。

Shinji now found himself in the middle of some stage, a real white spotlight trained on him, and he also had a cello in his hands, ready to be played.  
真嗣发现自己置身于某个舞台中央，一束真实的白色聚光灯打在他身上，手中还握着一把大提琴，准备演奏。

He blinked, quite surprised at the unexpected change of scenery, not to mention the uncanny realism of the dream he was in, for he could see, even they were in shadows, the faint colors of school uniforms, suits and dresses.  
他眨了眨眼，对这突如其来的场景变换感到相当惊讶，更不用说这梦境的逼真程度了，因为他能看见，即便是在阴影中，校服、西装和礼服的淡淡色彩。

He was back again in his school, the gymnasium still intact, and to the opposite Shinji was facing with his younger self, now with a cello of his own, and wearing a coat and tie, shorts and black shoes.  
他又回到了学校，体育馆依旧完好无损，而对面的真嗣正与年少的自己对峙，现在他手里拿着一把大提琴，穿着西装外套和领带，短裤以及黑色鞋子。

_What do you wish to play?  
你想演奏什么？_

_Me?_

_Yeah, you're the one with the melody in the head; does_ Suite Number One, Prelude in G Major _rings a bell? I mean,_ BWV 1007_?_  
是啊，你脑子里有旋律；第一组曲，G 大调前奏曲有印象吗？我是说，BWV 1007_?"_

_Yes, that's Bach. 是的，那是巴赫。_

_Well, let's play_ _this piece, shall we?_  
好吧，我们来演奏这首曲子，好吗？

In a flash, Shinji recalled this entire piece, down to every note on the music sheet, committed to rote memory as he drilled it into his mind almost everyday; as if on cue, he and his younger self took hold of the necks, fingers pressing on specific points, placed the bow across the strings, and began the opening notes of a masterpiece.  
刹那间，真嗣回忆起了整首曲子，每一个乐谱上的音符都深深烙印在他的记忆中，他几乎每天都在脑海中反复练习；仿佛是按下了开关，他和年幼的自己握住琴颈，手指按在特定的位置，将弓搭在弦上，开始了这首杰作的开篇音符。

This piece involved a lot of deft movement, fingerwork, and masterful timing; and even this was the prelude, for Bach written this for the pros, but not expecting adept amateurs like Shinji.  
这首曲子需要大量的灵巧动作、指法和精准的时机；即便这只是前奏，因为巴赫是为专业人士所写，但并未预料到像真嗣这样的业余高手。

Yet, playing the piece and hearing the melody he produced made him forget the bloodshed that he committed tens of minutes ago, out of the need to preserve lives and to avert a disaster.  
然而，演奏这首曲子并聆听自己创造的旋律，让他忘记了几十分钟前为了保护生命和避免灾难而犯下的杀戮。

It was surprisingly calming, his universe pieced back together like glue, as his will was being restored by the music's regenerative effects; time has become immaterial, and Shinji felt he was overcoming his own weaknesses.  
这出奇地令人平静，他的宇宙仿佛被胶水重新粘合，他的意志在音乐的再生效果下逐渐恢复；时间变得无关紧要，真嗣感到自己正在克服自身的弱点。

_This is one of the few best parts of your personality,_ the younger Shinji said.  
这是你性格中少数几个最好的部分之一，年轻的真嗣说道。

_I think t__his is what I'm better at,_ Shinji replied, careful not to let his mind and fingers veer away from playing.  
我想这正是我擅长的，真嗣回答，小心翼翼不让自己的思绪和手指偏离演奏。

_Why don't you apply that same diligence as an Eva pilot?  
为什么不在驾驶 EVA 时也保持同样的勤奋呢？_

_Because to be a pilot is to be violent.  
因为成为驾驶员就意味着要变得暴力。_

_Doing this is tough, you know, as hard as your piloting; it only becomes rewarding when you master it, even overcoming its bad sides. Of course, there's always a price to what you do, but then everything has a price to be paid, even freedom, peace and harmony.  
做这件事很艰难，你知道的，就像你的驾驶技术一样；只有当你掌握它，甚至克服了它的负面影响时，才会变得有回报。当然，你所做的一切总会有代价，但任何事物都有其代价，即使是自由、和平与和谐。_

_I see,_ Shinji agreed. _There's always a trade-off, right?_  
我明白了，真嗣同意道。总是有得有失，对吧？

_Yeah… and by the way—  
是啊……顺便说一句——_

_What?_

_If you can will yourself to feel peaceful and become clear-minded by playing this suite, then if you pilot once more, you could overcome your own difficulties. Only through weakness you could regain your strength by learning to understand yourself.  
如果你能通过演奏这套曲子让自己感到平静并变得头脑清晰，那么再次驾驶时，你就能克服自己的困难。只有通过弱点，你才能通过学会了解自己来重获力量。_

At this point they were at the final notes, the best part of the prelude, before in less than three minutes it was over; but for Shinji it was almost a lifetime, as he placed every exacting effort in bringing the music to life.  
此时他们已经到了前奏的最后几个音符，这是前奏中最精彩的部分，不到三分钟就结束了；但对真嗣来说，这几乎是一生的时间，因为他倾尽全力将音乐演绎得淋漓尽致。

Only then he could hear now the ovation, his audience clapping and cheering as they stood up to congratulate him, and Shinji felt elated as he stood up to face the crowd. He then bowed repeatedly, before the young man turned to look for his companion.  
只有那时他才能听到欢呼声，观众们起立鼓掌喝彩，向他祝贺，真嗣感到无比兴奋，他站起来面对人群。然后他反复鞠躬，年轻人才转身寻找他的同伴。

He wasn't there anymore; even the folding chair that the other Shinji sat on was gone.  
他已不在那里；就连另一个真嗣坐过的折叠椅也消失了。

---

"Shinji!" a voice yelled out from outside, snapping him out of his reverie. He scrambled to sit upright and saw that Tsutomo, down below, was waving at him. He then glanced at his HUD and it told him there was only four minutes of emergency power left, having drained the external packs completely.  
“真嗣！”外面传来一声呼喊，将他从沉思中惊醒。他急忙坐直身子，看到楼下的堤人正在向他挥手。他随即瞥了一眼 HUD，显示紧急电力仅剩四分钟，外部电池已完全耗尽。

The young man turned on his speaker system. "Yes?" he asked.  
年轻人打开了扬声系统。“什么事？”他问道。

"You doing fine there?" Tsutomo asked loudly, cupping both hands to carry his voice over.  
"你还好吗？" 筒友大声问道，双手拢在嘴边以便声音传得更远。

"Yeah, I'm okay," he answered.  
"嗯，我还好，" 他回答道。

"Well, the recovery crew's here, so you might have to step outside and let them do their work."  
"救援队已经到了，你可能得先出来，让他们进行工作。"

Shinji heaved a sigh of relief, as he realized that whatever he imagined seemed to have lasted almost a lifetime.  
真嗣长舒了一口气，因为他意识到自己所想象的似乎已经持续了几乎一生。

"Okay, I'm coming, but I have to power down first," he answered, before beginning the process to shut down Unit-01 completely: he flipped the main switch on one of the butterfly handles, and the Eva began to wind down until all was extinguished, leaving the emergency lights on. He then pulled a lever to partially eject the Entry Plug and drain out the LCL enveloping him. Only after the plug was empty did he climb up to open the hatch, letting out a lanyard from a reel to bring himself down. Shinji then attached himself to a harness, which he hooked it up to the lanyard.  
“好的，我来了，但我得先关机，”他回答道，然后开始彻底关闭初号机的程序：他翻转其中一个蝴蝶形手柄上的主开关，EVA 开始逐渐停止运转，直到所有灯光熄灭，只留下应急灯亮着。接着，他拉动一个杠杆，部分弹出插入栓并排空包裹着他的 LCL 液体。只有在插入栓完全排空后，他才爬上去打开舱门，从卷轴上放出一根缆绳让自己下来。随后，真嗣将自己固定在一个安全带上，并将它钩在缆绳上。

Cautiously he held tight to the rope as he descended, the motorized reel giving out more rope, but he breathed in the air once more, glad to be back from inhaling the strange liquid, until his feet was on the ground.  
他小心翼翼地紧握着绳索下降，电动卷轴不断放出更多绳子，但他再次呼吸到空气，庆幸自己不再吸入那种奇怪的液体，直到双脚稳稳落地。

As he stood in the shadow of the purple colossus, there his companions were waiting for him, and both girls, hesitant at first, quickly rushed towards and hugged him hard.  
当他站在紫色巨人的阴影中，他的同伴们正在那里等待着他，两位女孩起初犹豫，但很快便冲上前去，紧紧拥抱了他。

"I'm sorry, Asuka… Ayanami," Shinji apologized profusely as he burst into tears. "Forgive me for what I've done to him."  
“对不起，明日香……绫波，”真嗣泪流满面地道歉，“请原谅我对他所做的一切。”

Now Gendo was wondering why it was taking Morrissey too long to respond, as he glanced at the digital clock on the upper right corner of the main display; it was about twenty minutes after Unit-01 killed Nagisa, and he needed further confirmation that the boy was dead.  
此刻，源堂在想为什么莫里森的回应如此迟缓，他瞥了一眼主显示屏右上角的数字时钟；零号机杀死渚已经过去大约二十分钟了，他需要进一步确认那个男孩是否真的死了。

What's going on? 发生什么事了？

In the last two hours it appeared that confusion had reigned that they lost track of Fuyutsuki and those who opposed him, prompting Gendo to speculate about their whereabouts. Worse, he has yet to receive a report about Misato and Makoto, both still at large even at this moment.  
在过去两个小时里，混乱似乎占据了上风，他们失去了对冬月以及那些反对他的人的追踪，这让源堂开始猜测他们的下落。更糟糕的是，他至今未收到关于美里和真琴的报告，两人至今仍逍遥法外。

Where are they? 他们究竟在哪里？

The other two Children? Well, they have yet to report in or someone to at least tell him about their current status.  
另外两个孩子呢？他们还未汇报情况，也没有人至少告诉他他们的当前状态。

Whatever it was, Gendo was becoming disturbed about discrepancies popping unexpectedly, for he was supposed to be elated with the news of the last Angel slain.  
无论是什么原因，源堂开始对这些突如其来的差异感到不安，因为他本应为最后一只使徒被消灭的消息而感到高兴。

Twenty-five minutes after the incident, the recovery and containment crews arrived with their equipment and vehicles, the former having brought in a pair of massive Eva carriers, with multiple set of tires taller than a bus holding a frame large enough to keep the Eva in place while in transit; the latter with their trucks full of decontamination gear and biohazard suits.  
事故发生二十五分钟后，回收和 containment 队伍带着他们的设备和车辆抵达，前者带来了两辆巨大的 EVA 运输车，配备多组比公交车还高的轮胎，框架足够大以在运输过程中固定住 EVA；后者则满载着去污装备和生化防护服。

One recovery team set about pulling Unit-02 out of the larger lake, reeling her in with steel cables attached to the pauldrons, until they were able to set her secure in the vehicle's reinforced steel frame.  
一支回收小组开始从较大的湖泊中拖出二号机，用固定在肩甲上的钢缆将她拉出，直到她被稳稳地安置在车辆加固的钢架上。

Under the watchful eyes of the security troopers who ringed the chamber, the rest of this group began working on Unit-01, towering over the lake of LCL; after parking halfway into the lake, the frame of the Eva transporter slowly climbed to the vertical, before lining up the attachment points and then docking the Eva carefully until the locks snapped in place.  
在环绕着房间的安保士兵的注视下，其余人员开始处理零号机，它矗立在 LCL 湖中；在湖中停靠一半后，Eva 运输车的框架缓缓升至垂直位置，然后对准连接点，小心翼翼地将 Eva 对接，直到锁定装置咔嗒一声固定到位。

Once Unit-01 was lowered in her place on the transporter, the decontamination team rolled in their tanker truck filled with disinfectant; before they could start sanitizing the Eva, a handful of men in suits went about meticulously collecting blood and flesh samples from the crimson-varnished right hand, every piece of loose biological material going into test tubes before the samples were stored in a Styrofoam box, to be given to the forensics lab for further analysis.  
一旦零号机被放置在运输车上的位置，消毒团队便将装满消毒剂的罐车推入；在他们开始对 Eva 进行消毒之前，一群身着西装的人仔细地从涂满鲜血的右手上收集血液和肉样，每一块松散的生物材料都被放入试管中，然后样本被存放在泡沫塑料箱中，交给法医实验室进行进一步分析。

Meanwhile, search teams combed the entire chamber, looking for anything significant, but so far all they had recovered was Kaworu's torn garments, and they too were bagged and tagged before being dispatched to the waiting trucks.  
与此同时，搜救队仔细搜查了整个房间，寻找任何重要的物品，但到目前为止，他们只找到了被撕破的渚薰的衣服，这些衣物也被装袋并标记后，送往等待的卡车。

As the work progressed, while Tsutomo and Misato were busy coordinating with the teams and exchanging communications with Fuyutsuki, someone was gracious enough to pass around refreshments to everyone from a cooler, in the form of soda cans and bottled water.  
随着工作的推进，当津友和美里忙于与团队协调并交换与冬月通信时，有人慷慨地从冷却器中分发饮料给每个人，形式是罐装汽水和瓶装水。

Near the wall of the chamber, the Children sat on the ledge, each babying an uncorked bottle of water as they watched the ongoing recovery operation.  
在房间的墙边，孩子们坐在壁架上，每人抱着一瓶未开盖的水，观看着正在进行的重建工作。

"I'm sorry if I was… damn," Shinji said to Asuka and Rei. "Sorry about feeling guilty."  
“如果我刚才……该死，”真嗣对明日香和绫波说，“抱歉，我感到内疚了。”

Rei said nothing, as if in mourning, but Asuka draped her arm around the girl's shoulder in sympathy; the First Children was now wearing an old terrycloth bathrobe to cover herself.  
丽一言不发，仿佛在哀悼，但明日香同情地搂住了女孩的肩膀；第一少女现在穿着一件旧毛巾布浴袍来遮盖自己。

"I didn't have much of a choice except for what he said," Shinji continued before he drank from his bottle.  
“除了他说的，我别无选择，”真嗣继续说道，然后从瓶子里喝了一口。

"What you did was justifiable," Rei finally said, breaking her silence. "I have nothing against you for his death. For that I have given you my forgiveness."  
“你所做的是有理由的，”丽终于打破沉默说道，“对于他的死，我对你没有任何异议。为此，我已经给予你我的宽恕。”

"But—" “但是——”

Rei looked into his eyes. "He wanted this to end in his way," she said. "As much as I am sad because of his death, should you feel guilty about killing him, it was his choice to die for he cannot fight fate and because he was an Angel."  
丽凝视着他的眼睛。“他希望以自己的方式结束这一切，”她说道，“尽管他的死让我感到悲伤，但如果你因为杀了他而感到内疚，那大可不必，因为这是他选择去死的，他无法对抗命运，因为他是一个天使。”

Shinji sighed, still feeling uneasy even after he experienced what seemed to be a trance in the Entry Plug.  
真嗣叹了口气，即便在插入栓中经历了一场恍若出神的状态后，他依然感到不安。

"God, I'm so tired about this," he said in frustration, the sheer weight of responsibility squarely resting on his shoulders.  
“上帝啊，我真是受够了，”他沮丧地说道，沉重的责任感如山般压在他的肩上。

"I think we need to head back and take a break," Asuka said when Misato and Tsutomo arrived with Fuyutsuki in tow, prompting the Children to stand up.  
"我想我们需要回去休息一下，"明日香说道，当美里和堤摩吉带着冬月一起到达时，孩子们纷纷站了起来。

"How all of you are doing?" Fuyutsuki asked with the other two adults watching him from behind.  
"你们大家都还好吗？"冬月问道，其他两位成年人从他身后注视着他。

"We're just fine, sir," Shinji answered, with Asuka holding his hand and Rei standing besides him.  
“我们很好，先生，”真嗣回答道，身边是握着他手的明日香和站在一旁的丽。

Fuyutsuki shook his head. "I'm sure you're disappointed with what you did to Nagisa."  
冬月摇了摇头。“我确信你对渚所做的一切感到失望。”

Shinji looked glum. "I had not much of a choice, sir. It's either he die or we all die."  
真嗣显得很沮丧。“我没有太多选择，先生。要么他死，要么我们全都死。”

"I see. He was a very good to all of you, but what's important are the memories you have to cherish while he was still alive, even if he was an enemy in the end."  
"我明白了。他对你们都很好，但重要的是你们在他生前所珍藏的记忆，即使他最终成了敌人。"

"I'm trying to cope with that fact."  
"我正在努力接受这个事实。"

"Yes, you have to," the old man said, "but I'm afraid that I need you Children to undergo a debriefing. Only afterwards you have to get yourselves some rest."  
"是的，你必须这么做，""老人说，""但恐怕我需要你们这些孩子接受一次汇报。之后你们才能好好休息。"

The three Children blinked as the old man pointed at several chairs and tables set up besides one of the trucks parked outside the chamber; there Director Hamamoto was waiting for them, with Shinichi Morisato standing by, holding a tablet PC to document the proceedings.  
三位孩子眨了眨眼，只见老人指向几张摆在一辆卡车旁的椅子和桌子；在那儿，桥本导演正等着他们，森里真一站在一旁，手持平板电脑记录着整个过程。

"What about Father?" Shinji asked.  
“父亲怎么办？”真嗣问道。

"As soon as you go there to the table," Fuyutsuki said. "I'll have to leave to deal with him."  
“你一去到桌子那边，”冬月说，“我就得离开去处理他。”

"But he could arrest you again."  
"但他可能会再次逮捕你。"

Fuyutsuki smiled sadly. "Don't worry," he said. "I have some backup with me."  
冬月微笑着，带着一丝哀伤。“别担心，”他说，“我带了些后备支援。”

Without warning, one member of the containment team spotted something floating in the lake. "Hey, I found something!" the man yelled out.  
毫无预警地，封锁小组的一名成员在湖中发现了一些漂浮物。“嘿，我找到了什么！”那人大声喊道。

The commotion surprised them, grabbing their attention.  
突如其来的骚动让他们吃了一惊，吸引了他们的注意力。

His commanding officer, several meters away, turned around. "What is it?"  
他的指挥官在几米外转过身来。“怎么了？”

The man pointed at what appeared to be a limb. "It's an arm, and I need a pole to get to it," he said.  
那人指向看似是肢体的东西。“这是一条手臂，我需要一根杆子才能够到它。”他说。

Quickly two of his colleagues rushed with a pole and a plastic bag clearly marked with a biohazard sign; he was given the pole, which had a hook on one end, and carefully he extended the pole far enough to reach the limb.  
他的两名同事迅速拿着一根杆子和一个明显标有生物危害标志的塑料袋冲了过来；他接过杆子，杆子一端有个钩子，小心翼翼地将杆子伸到足够远以够到那根树枝。

It was Kaworu's arm, all right, as if it was hastily hacked off his body.  
确实是渚薰的手臂，仿佛是匆忙从他身体上砍下来的。

Seeing this gory sight with her eyes, Asuka gasped in disgust and averted away from the scene by turning her head to Shinji, who was just as transfixed as his companions. Rei quickly took hold of Shinji's hand, as if she needed support.  
亲眼目睹这血腥的一幕，明日香厌恶地倒吸一口气，转过头避开这场景，看向真嗣，他和其他人一样目不转睛。绫波立刻握住了真嗣的手，仿佛需要支持。

The pole caught onto the body part, and the man pulled back the pole until his gloved hands got hold of the dismembered arm and placed it into the bag held by the third man.  
那根杆子勾住了身体部位，男子将杆子拉回，直到戴着手套的双手抓住了那只断臂，并将其放入第三个人拿着的袋子中。

As the bagged limb was taken away to be stored, Fuyutsuki came up to the officer and said, "I need that arm, lieutenant."  
当装着断肢的袋子被拿走存放时，冬月来到警官面前说：“中尉，我需要那只手臂。”

"For what, sir?" the lieutenant asked.  
“为了什么，长官？”中尉问道。

"Let's bring it to the forensics lab," Fuyutsuki answered. "I want to show that arm to the Commander."  
“我们把它送到法医实验室去，”冬月回答，“我想让指挥官看看这条手臂。”

The officer blinked. "But you're still at large, and he wants your neck. You can't-"  
警官眨了眨眼。“但你仍在逃，他想要你的命。你不能——”

The old man upheld a raised finger, cutting the lieutenant off. "I have an idea."  
老人竖起一根手指，打断了中尉的话。“我有个主意。”

"Pardon me, sir?" “劳驾，先生？”

Fuyutsuki stared at the lieutenant and said, "Trust me on this."  
“相信我。”副司令看着中尉说道。

Back in the command center and still waiting for Morrissey, Gendo was becoming impatient when his phone on his desk trilled. He picked it up.  
回到指挥中心，莫里西仍未到来，碇源堂开始变得不耐烦。此时，他桌上的电话响了起来。他拿起电话。

"Sir, this is Director Morrissey," the man on the other end said.  
“先生，我是莫里西导演，”电话那头的人说道。

"What took you so long?" Gendo questioned. "Where are you?"  
"你怎么这么慢？" 源堂质问道。"你在哪儿？"

"I apologize for the inconvenience," Morrissey admitted, trying not to let humiliation creep into his voice. "I was too busy coordinating the search teams, and we're on our way now."  
"对于给您带来的不便，我深表歉意，" 莫里西承认道，尽量不让羞愧感渗入他的声音。"我一直在忙于协调搜索队，我们现在正赶过去。"

Time to cut the crap. "Get to the point, Director. Have you caught Fuyutsuki?"  
是时候直奔主题了。"说重点，局长。你抓到冬月了吗？"

"Yes, we have him and the rest in cuffs. Of course we also have proof that Nagisa is dead."  
"是的，我们已经将他和其余人铐上了。当然，我们也有证据证明渚已经死了。"

Gendo blinked behind his amber glasses. "Where?"  
碇源堂在他琥珀色的眼镜后眨了眨眼。"哪里？"

"He left only an arm, and that's all," Morrissey said. "You may come to see it for yourself at the forensics lab, and then we'll haul Fuyutsuki and the others back to the Stockade."  
"他只留下了一只手臂，仅此而已，"莫里森说。"你可以亲自到法医实验室来看，然后我们再把冬月和其他人押回禁闭室。"

"I see. I will be there in a few minutes," Gendo replied, before he put down the phone. He then stood up and told the operators present that he will be gone for a while, charging one of them to take the job of the duty officer, before he walked away and boarded the elevator.  
"我明白了。我几分钟后就到，" 源渡回答，然后挂断了电话。他随即站起身，告诉在场的操作员们他将离开一会儿，并指派其中一人暂时接替值班官的职责，随后他走开并登上了电梯。

---

At the other end of the line, in the forensics lab Morrissey was seated in an office chair, his wrist bound with binders, and with Tsutomo brandishing a gun pointed to the side of his head.  
在电话的另一端，法医实验室里，莫里西坐在办公椅上，手腕被绑带束缚，而津友则手持一把枪，枪口对准了他的太阳穴。

"It's done," he calmly said as Tsutomo returned the phone to its cradle, having held it to the Englishman's ear while talking to Gendo.  
"完成了，" 他平静地说道，筒本将电话放回原位，之前一直将话筒贴在英国人的耳边与源堂通话。

Tsutomo then turned to Fuyutsuki, who then nodded in approval. "Let's wait," the old man added.  
筒本随后转向冬月，后者点头表示同意。"我们等着吧，" 老人补充道。

"I'm sure this is going to work, sir," Tsutomo remarked, before pushing the chair with Morrissey sitting on it, rolling him over to one corner where a pair of SRT operators awaited to keep an eye on the Englishman.  
"我相信这会成功的，先生，" 筒本说道，随后推动椅子，让坐在上面的莫里森滑向角落，那里有一对 SRT 操作员正等着监视这位英国人。

"Thank you, and oh, call Odani and Akagi to have the operating room ready in ten minutes," Fuyutsuki reminded.  
"谢谢，对了，打电话给织谷和赤城，让他们在十分钟内准备好手术室，" 冬月提醒道。

Tsutomo nodded. "Okay, sir," he said, taking hold of his mobile phone and began dialing.  
筒本点了点头。“好的，先生。”他说着，拿起手机开始拨号。

---

A few minutes later Gendo arrived at the forensics lab, and sure, he saw Morrissey seated behind an operating table, and on it was a Styrofoam box without its cover. He walked up to the Englishman and asked, "Where's the rest of your men?"  
几分钟后，源度到达了法医实验室，果然，他看到莫里西坐在一张操作台后，台上是一个没有盖子的泡沫塑料箱。他走向英国人，问道：“你的其他人在哪儿？”

"They're away in the field," Morrissey lied as he watched Gendo peer into the box, which contained Kaworu's arm wrapped in plastic and surrounded by blocks of dry ice; they produced swirls of cold smoke as they settled on the bottom of the box.  
“他们都在外面执行任务。”莫里西撒谎道，同时看着源度往箱子里看，里面是包裹在塑料里的渚薰的手臂，周围堆满了干冰；干冰在箱底融化，冒出阵阵冷烟。

Gendo nodded in approval. Nagisa was indeed dead.  
源堂点头表示认可。渚确实已经死了。

"Have you seen the Third Children?" Gendo asked, using this designation for Shinji, rather than using his name.  
“你见到第三适格者了吗？”源堂问道，他用这个代号称呼真嗣，而不是直接叫他的名字。

"That boy? He's being debriefed right now," Morrissey answered.  
“那个孩子？他现在正在接受汇报，”莫里西回答道。

Gendo had no desire to talk to Shinji; to him the boy, even if he proved himself useful, was still too much of an emotional distraction to wean him away from his real goal.  
源堂并不想和真嗣交谈；对他来说，即便这孩子证明了自己的用处，但情感上的牵绊仍太过强烈，难以让他偏离真正的目标。

Instead, here was the definitive proof that Kaworu Nagisa, the Fifth Children, infiltrator and agent of SEELE, no longer existed except for this pale-skinned limb that once belonged to his body, crushed to a bloody pulp.  
相反，这里有着确凿的证据表明，第五适格者，卡哇兰·渚，SEELE 的渗透者和代理人，除了这具曾经属于他身体的苍白残肢，已被碾成血肉模糊的一团，不复存在。

He looked up to Morrissey, gave him a smile and in triumph he said, "It is done."  
他抬头望向莫里塞，露出一抹微笑，得意地说道：“已经完成了。”

Unexpectedly he heard footfalls, and Gendo turned around to see SRT operators entering the room, spreading out and then they aimed their submachine guns at him.  
出乎意料地，他听到了脚步声，源堂转身一看，只见 SRT 操作员们进入房间，分散开来，随即用冲锋枪对准了他。

Gendo was astonished for a second, before he had a flash of anger. "What the hell is this?" he demanded.  
源堂先是震惊了一瞬，随即怒火中烧。“这到底是怎么回事？”他厉声质问。

Just then Fuyutsuki walked into the room, with Tsutomo behind him. The old man also had a pistol in his right hand.  
就在这时，冬月走进了房间，后面跟着堤人。老人右手还握着一把手枪。

"You… I don't believe that you have the nerve to do this to me!" Gendo raged and his hand reached into the pocket of his coat containing the Walther PPK/S pistol. Sharp-eyed soldiers rushed to restrain him by the arms, and he tried to overpower them, only to have his forearms painfully twisted and bound to his back.  
“你……我不相信你有胆量对我这么做！”源渡怒吼着，手伸向大衣口袋，里面藏着那把瓦尔特 PPK/S 手枪。眼尖的士兵们迅速上前抓住他的双臂，他试图挣脱，却被痛苦地扭转身前臂，紧紧束缚。

"You were once my student and friend," Fuyutsuki said coolly, but he was grim-faced, eyes flashing with defiance as the troopers took away Gendo's pistol. "I became your confidant and collaborator in your enterprise, but for years since I associated myself with you, I and many others have endured much humiliation with silence as we tried to help you make your dream come true, and some of them even paid that with their own lives. However, in the service of mankind and in this end, I have no choice but it's my duty to stop you."  
“你曾是我的学生和朋友，”冬月冷静地说道，但面色凝重，眼中闪烁着反抗的光芒，士兵们夺走了源渡的手枪。“我成了你事业中的知己和合作者，但自从与你结交以来，我和许多人默默忍受了许多屈辱，试图帮你实现梦想，其中一些人甚至为此付出了生命。然而，为了人类的福祉和最终的使命，我别无选择，只能履行阻止你的职责。”

Gendo's face was now distorted into rage, as if he was preparing to launch himself onto Fuyutsuki. "This is outrageous!" he exclaimed. "You can't stop me from getting to Yui!"  
源堂的脸此刻因愤怒而扭曲，仿佛正准备扑向冬月。“这太荒谬了！”他吼道，“你阻止不了我去找唯！”

Fuyutsuki swung the pistol up, which was really a tranquilizer dart gun, loaded with sodium pentothal. "I'm sorry, but I have to do this," he said before pulling the trigger.  
冬月举起手中的枪，实际上是一把装有硫喷妥钠的麻醉枪。“对不起，但我必须这么做。”他说完便扣动了扳机。

The dart gun let out a 'phut', and the projectile struck Gendo right in the chest, the dart embedding itself where his heart was located.  
麻醉枪发出一声‘噗’的轻响，飞镖准确击中了源堂的胸膛，深深嵌入他心脏所在的位置。

"Damn you… I don't believe…" Gendo whispered as the tranquilizer quickly entered his bloodstream, and hence to his brain, causing his vision to fade and wash out. "You… betrayed… me…" he gasped before the darkness finally overwhelmed him.  
“该死的…我不相信…” 源堂低声咒骂，镇静剂迅速进入他的血液，进而影响大脑，使他的视线逐渐模糊并消失。“你…背叛…我…” 他在黑暗最终吞没他之前喘息道。

As his body sagged into unconsciousness, Gendo's amber-colored glasses let loose from the lobes of his ears and dropped to the floor, its lenses almost shattered to pieces as they hit the tiled surface.  
随着他的身体陷入昏迷，源堂那副琥珀色的眼镜从耳垂上滑落，摔在地板上，镜片几乎碎裂成片，撞击在瓷砖表面。

At the same time Fuyutsuki sighed, and then he whispered, "Yui, I'm sorry for your husband, but we've got to save the future."  
与此同时，冬月叹了口气，然后低声说道：“唯，我为你的丈夫感到抱歉，但我们必须拯救未来。”

Over a table strewn with papers and two cups of tea, Shinji was in the middle of the debriefing process with Hamamoto, when the old man heard his two-way radio come to life. Hamamoto picked it up and pressed the button. "Hamamoto here, sir," he said.  
在一张散落着文件和两杯茶的桌子旁，真嗣正与滨本进行着汇报过程，这时老人听到他的双向无线电响了起来。滨本拿起它并按下按钮。“滨本在此，长官，”他说道。

"It's done," Fuyutsuki said. "We're in the process of getting Ikari out to the operating room, and in no time we'll get Adam off his hand."  
“已经完成了，”冬月说，“我们正在将碇送进手术室，很快就能从他手上取下亚当了。”

The announcement surprised not just Shinji, but Misato, Rei and Asuka, the three women watching the debriefing while sitting around the table, awaiting their turn.  
这个消息不仅让真嗣感到惊讶，还有坐在桌旁观看汇报的三个女人——美里、丽和明日香，她们都在等待轮到自己。

"That was brilliant, sir," Hamamoto praised.  
"那真是精彩，先生，" 滨本赞扬道。

"At any rate, once we have Adam free, this thing will have to be secured at all times. I don't want anyone to come close to it, so pick and assign some of your men to guard Adam."  
"无论如何，一旦我们让亚当自由，这件东西必须时刻严加保管。我不希望任何人靠近它，所以挑选并指派一些你的人来守卫亚当。"

Hamamoto nodded. "Will do that, sir."  
滨本点头。"我会照办的，先生。"

"I want Ikari to be kept under close watch, as I have to start organizing an ad-hoc committee to run this place and to prepare for the worst."  
"我希望对碇进行严密监控，因为我必须开始组织一个特别委员会来管理这个地方，并做好最坏的准备。"

Shinji blinked in surprise. "Was that Father that he's talking about?"  
真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼。"他指的是父亲吗？"

"Yes, and I'm sorry it has to be done," Hamamoto said as he covered the radio with his hand, before returning to Fuyutsuki. "Anything else, sir?"  
"是的，我很抱歉必须这样做，"滨本说着用手捂住无线电，然后转向冬月。"还有其他事吗，先生？"

"I want every head of every department, including you and everyone involved to meet at the conference room at oh-seven-hundred hours."  
“我希望所有部门负责人，包括你和所有相关人员，在七点整到会议室集合。”

Hamamoto checked his watch; it was 5:36 in the morning, and the general emergency meeting was an hour and a half away. "I copy that, sir."  
浜本检查了他的手表；现在是早上 5 点 36 分，而紧急会议还有一个半小时才开始。“我明白了，长官。”

"Furthermore, I intend to address everyone in the main hall at oh-nine-hundred hours with a special declaration of emergency, as I will raise the alert status to Red Level Three. That's all."  
“此外，我打算在九点整在主厅向所有人发表一项特别紧急声明，届时我将把警戒级别提升至红色三级。完毕。”

Hamamoto nodded. "Thank you, sir."  
浜本点了点头。"谢谢您，先生。"

"My pleasure," Fuyutsuki said. "Over and out."  
"不客气，" 冬月说。"完毕。"

"What happened?" Shinji asked once Hamamoto set the radio back on the table.  
"发生了什么？" 真嗣在浜本将无线电放回桌上后问道。

"I'm sorry to say that your father is now under arrest," Hamamoto said. "Fuyutsuki had to do that to put an end to the Commander's Instrumentality doomsday plan."  
“很遗憾地告诉您，您的父亲现在已被逮捕，”浜本说。“冬月不得不这么做，以终结指挥官的‘人类补完计划’末日方案。”

Shinji shook his head.  
真嗣摇了摇头。

"You regret something about him?" the old man asked, noticing the gesture.  
“你对他有什么后悔的吗？”老人注意到这个动作，问道。

"No… Nothing," the young man said, as he sensed a bitter taste in his mouth. "It's just that his selfishness has finally caught up with him."  
“不……没什么，”年轻人说着，感觉到嘴里一阵苦涩。“只是他的自私终于让他自食其果了。”

Just then Hamamoto heard his mobile phone ringing. He promptly picked it up. "Yes?" he spoke. "Okay, but she's supposed to… Right, I'm sending her ASAP." The old director then said, "Colonel, I think you're needed by the forensics team to identify some of his stuff at his quarters, so I'll let you go for now, and don't worry, these kids will be fine under my watch, okay?"  
就在这时，Hamamoto 听到他的手机响了。他迅速接起电话。“喂？”他说道。“好的，但她应该……对，我马上派她过去。”老导演接着说：“上校，我想法医团队需要你去他的住处辨认一些物品，所以你现在可以走了，别担心，这些孩子在我看管下不会有事的，好吗？”

Misato rose from her seat. "Thank you, Director," she said.  
Misato 从座位上站起来。“谢谢您，局长，”她说道。

With Gendo on the operating table and completely put under anesthetics, Ritsuko and Natsumi, now wearing surgical greens, carefully cut Adam away from his skin using a scalpel. The procedure lasted no more than thirty minutes, before Ritsuko used a low-powered laser to cauterize and weld the flaps of skin back in place on the palm of his hand.  
Gendo 躺在手术台上，完全被麻醉了，Ritsuko 和 Natsumi 现在穿着手术服，小心翼翼地用手术刀将亚当从他的皮肤上切下来。整个过程不超过三十分钟，随后 Ritsuko 使用低功率激光将皮肤瓣重新烧灼并焊接回他手掌的位置。

As Ritsuko worked on mending the hand, treating it with disinfectant and wrapping it in bandage, Natsumi then gingerly moved Adam into a large stainless steel box, which she then carefully poured on some phase-change Bakelite from a dispenser to envelope it completely, before allowing a small electrical charge to solidify it. The woman then hefted the box into a larger, insulated steel box containing liquid nitrogen to keep the creature preserved, before Maya came over to shut the lid and lock it.  
当律子忙着修复手部，用消毒剂处理并包扎绷带时，夏美小心翼翼地将亚当移入一个大型不锈钢箱中，然后从分配器中仔细倒入一些相变酚醛塑料，将其完全包裹，再施以微弱电流使其固化。随后，她将箱子抬进一个装有液氮的大型保温钢箱中，以保持生物的保存状态，接着由摩耶过来关闭并锁上盖子。

With the operation done, Ritsuko ordered the SRT team to transport the still-unconscious Gendo to a room and keep him under guard. She expected him to be awake after six hours, and only then he can be moved to the Stockade.  
手术完成后，律子命令 SRT 小队将仍处于昏迷状态的源堂转移到一个房间并加以看守。她预计他将在六小时后醒来，只有那时才能将他转移到拘留所。

As the guards carted him out of the operating room, Ritsuko sighed as she pulled out the gloves off her hands. "It's done."  
当警卫将他拖出手术室时，Ritsuko 叹了口气，从手上扯下手套。“完成了。”

"I hope we did it right this time," Natsumi opined, while tossing her gloves into a disposal bin.  
“希望这次我们做对了，”Natsumi 说道，同时将手套扔进垃圾桶。

"In my case," Ritsuko said, "No more strings attached, and nothing more to worry about except whatever we'll be facing in the next twenty-four hours." She then smiled.  
“就我而言，”Ritsuko 说，“不再有牵绊，除了接下来二十四小时我们将要面对的事情外，没有什么可担心的了。”她随即微笑了。

But Maya still looked worried, as she inwardly contemplated the possibility of armed violence, which she had little stomach for.  
但玛雅看起来仍然忧心忡忡，她内心思索着可能发生的武装冲突，对此她实在难以承受。

**Lounge and Snack Bar****, Level 12, Central Dogma - Now**  
休息室与小吃吧，第 12 层，中央教条区 - 现在

Meanwhile, Misato walked into the lounge, which was several floors below the now-secured BOQ; she carried the envelope that was given to her by the Section Two agent, and she saw that the Children were gathered around the living room, with Shinji lying on the couch, his head on Asuka's hips, and Rei, her eyes closed, was curled on an overstuffed chair, taking a nap as she was completely exhausted by her ordeal. Misato's laptop and its bag was on the coffee table, having been returned by Natsumi after she successfully hacked her way through the network and manipulated MAGI at her bidding.  
与此同时，美里走进了位于几层楼之下的休息室，这里已经安全无虞；她手中拿着第二课特工交给她的信封，看到孩子们聚集在客厅里，真嗣躺在沙发上，头枕在明日香的腰间，而绫波则闭着眼睛蜷缩在一张宽大的椅子上，疲惫不堪地小憩，显然是刚刚经历了一场磨难。美里的笔记本电脑和包放在咖啡桌上，那是夏美在成功黑入网络并操控 MAGI 后归还的。

The Children were awakened and surprised by her arrival, to which Misato held up the envelope, placed it on the table and said, "Kaworu left this for us."  
孩子们被她的到来唤醒并感到惊讶，对此，美里举起信封，放在桌上说道：“渚薰留了这个给我们。”

"What's that?" Asuka said.  
"那是什么？" 明日香问道。

Misato walked over to one of the vending machines lining the wall, punched in a few yen coins and pressed a button to get her can of coffee. "Could be a goodbye letter," she said.  
美里走到墙边的一台自动售货机前，投入几枚硬币并按下按钮，取出一罐咖啡。"可能是告别信，"她说道。

Drowsily Shinji picked up the envelope and tore it open, which turned out to contain a compact disc inside a jewelcase. "It's a disc."  
昏昏欲睡的 Shinji 拿起信封，撕开它，发现里面是一张装在塑料盒里的光盘。"这是一张光盘。"

"Play it," Misato ordered as she picked up the can from the bin.  
“播放吧，”美里从垃圾桶里捡起罐子命令道。

Asuka then pulled the laptop towards her and then turned it on. While Misato drank, and with Shinji and Rei watching her, Asuka placed the disc into the drive and let the computer play it.  
明日香随后将笔记本电脑拉向自己并开机。在美里喝着饮料，真嗣和丽注视着她的同时，明日香将光盘放入驱动器，让电脑开始播放。

On the video player, Kaworu appeared onscreen. He looked calm and composed, wearing a yellow t-shirt, and then he began to speak.  
在视频播放器上，渚薰出现在屏幕中。他看起来平静而沉着，穿着一件黄色 T 恤，随后开始说话。

"_Before I would like to explain__, first I want to admit that… That I'm sorry if I ever lied to all of you."_  
“在我解释之前，首先我想承认……如果我曾经对你们撒过谎，我感到非常抱歉。”

Kaworu then sighed and said, _"My name is Kaworu Nagisa, and I was sent here by an entity called SEELE to punish Commander Ikari for repeatedly defying their orders, and to fulfill the prophecy as stated in the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. I am also an Angel, and they call me Tabris, which is my real name._  
渚薰随后叹了口气，说道：“我的名字是渚薰，我被一个名为 SEELE 的组织派遣到这里，以惩罚屡次违抗他们命令的碇司令，并实现《死海文书》中所预言的使命。我也是一位使徒，他们称我为塔布里斯，这是我的真名。”

"_The orders given to me before I left was to befriend Shinji and then try to break his will by betraying him__, and almost at the same time try to make contact with Adam. But that's not what I really wanted to do._  
在我离开前得到的命令是与真嗣交朋友，然后通过背叛他来试图摧毁他的意志，同时尝试与亚当接触。但这并不是我真正想做的事情。

"_Instead, from the day I arrived my life, however brief, was no longer the same again. The day I first met you, Rei, you left quite a huge impression on me. I mean, I cannot forget that moment, and then we collided the next day, and…_  
相反，从我到达的那天起，无论多么短暂，我的生活就再也不一样了。我第一次见到你的那天，绫波，你给我留下了非常深刻的印象。我是说，我无法忘记那一刻，然后第二天我们就撞在一起了，而且……

Kaworu smiled for a moment.  
渚薰微笑了一会儿。

"_Fate seems to be a very quirky fellow, as I feel as if I was destined to meet all of you, for a perfectly good reason. The more involved I was with you, the more I learned about what it means to be truly human__, even if there's pain involved._  
"“命运似乎是个非常古怪的家伙，我感觉自己注定要遇见你们所有人，有充分的理由。我与你们越亲近，就越能理解什么是真正的人性，哪怕其中伴随着痛苦。”

Kaworu looked away from the camera for a few seconds, before he resumed. "_Misato, if you're watching this, then you might want to hear what they're up to."_  
渚薰从镜头前移开视线几秒钟，随后继续说道：“美里，如果你在看这段视频，那么你可能需要知道他们正在策划什么。”

"I'm ready," Misato answered.  
“我准备好了，”美里回答道。

"_Through collaboration with the other NERV installations, SEELE has in secret produced nine Mass-Production type Evas without your knowledge, for these are very different from the first five Evas, and we Children cannot take them very lightly."_  
“通过与其他 NERV 设施的合作，SEELE 秘密制造了九台量产型 EVA，而你对此一无所知，这些 EVA 与最初的五台截然不同，我们孩子们不能掉以轻心。”

"What?" Asuka demanded. "什么？" 明日香质问道。

"_To date, these are the most advanced Evas ever created, and to complete their capabilities each of them have their own Dummy Plug system that was based on my thought patterns._ _Finally, they also have their own S2 Engines, years ahead of what Akagi or Doctor Katsuragi could ever hope to produce and activate."_  
"迄今为止，这些是最先进的 Eva，为了充分发挥它们的性能，每台 Eva 都配备了基于我的思维模式设计的模拟插入栓系统。最后，它们还拥有自己的 S2 引擎，远超赤木博士或葛城博士所能期望制造和激活的水平。"

Misato shook her head. "Now that confirms Makoto's report," she remarked.  
美里摇了摇头。“这下证实了真琴的报告，”她评论道。

"_Each of these MPs, as we call them, were built in separate secret locations before being transported to a staging area located in Siberia; meanwhile the Engines and the DPs – yes, the Dummy Plugs – were built at Golgotha Base."_  
“这些我们称之为 MP 的机体，都是在各自的秘密地点分别建造，然后运送到位于西伯利亚的集结区；与此同时，引擎和 DPs——没错，就是那些模拟插件——则是在戈尔戈萨基地制造的。”

Shinji blinked. "Golgotha Base?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“戈尔戈萨基地？”

"I believe it's located somewhere in Central Asia," Misato answered. "Kazakhstan, I think."  
"我认为它位于中亚的某个地方，"美里回答道，"我想是哈萨克斯坦。"

"_As you can see, with my thought patterns, the DP__s were programmed to first set their AT-Fields at low output, to make themselves look they're easy to kill, but after a few minutes they'll raise up their output to a high percentage, to near hundred percent, to get up and finish off their opponents."_  
"正如你所见，通过我的思维模式，DP__s 最初被设定为低输出 AT 力场，让自己看起来容易被打败，但几分钟后，它们会提高输出到高百分比，接近百分之百，站起来消灭对手。"

"Shit," Asuka cursed. "I never expected them to be that tough."  
"该死，"明日香咒骂道，"我从没想过它们会这么强。"

"_The only way to destroy them is to aim for their cores, but because they're advanced models, expect them to be very hard targets to kill_ _as they're fast movers, and they can even fly with their wings. I know this because I've seen how they were being trained under simulation mode, and often they win in less than two minutes before either an Angel or you could mount an counter-attack. So the only other way is to have a strong offense and a quick strategy."_  
唯一能摧毁它们的方法是瞄准它们的核，但由于它们是高级型号，预计它们会是非常难以击杀的目标，因为它们移动迅速，甚至能用翅膀飞行。我知道这一点是因为我见过它们在模拟模式下训练，通常它们在不到两分钟内就能获胜，而天使或你还没来得及发起反击。所以，另一种方法就是采取强有力的进攻和迅速的策略。

Shinji looked at both Rei and Asuka, wondering what better they must do to counter these would-be archenemies; Misato chugged more of her coffee.  
真嗣看着绫波和明日香，想知道他们该如何应对这些潜在的劲敌；美里又喝了一大口咖啡。

"_Now, these Evas are part of Chairman Lorenz's strategy, in which his plan is to eventually neutralize the Geofront and bring his plan into reality, but the problem is that I don't know what else they have in mind to destroy you all, as I was kept in the dark regarding_ _some of their other methods of attack. Still I predict that once he determines that I am dead and thus out of the picture, he will mobilize all of his forces to prepare for Third Impact. They will attack where there's a breach or two in the defenses, and will do so from all directions; they will never take any prisoners alive."_  
"现在，这些 EVA 是洛伦兹主席战略的一部分，他的计划最终是要中立化地底都市并实现他的目标，但问题是我不知道他们还有哪些手段来摧毁你们，因为我对他们的某些攻击方法一无所知。不过我预测，一旦他确定我已经死亡，从而不再构成威胁，他就会调动所有力量准备第三次冲击。他们会从防御的缺口发起攻击，四面八方而来；他们绝不会留下任何活口。"

Instinctively Kaworu then ran his hand through his hair.  
本能地，渚薰随后拨弄了一下自己的头发。

"_However, Misato, there's another thing I should mention: does Colonel Miles Quaritch ring a bell to you?"_  
"不过，美里，还有一件事我应该提一下：迈尔斯·夸里奇上校这个名字对你有印象吗？"

At the mere mention of that name, Misato choked on her coffee. "What?"  
仅仅提到那个名字，美里就被咖啡呛到了。“什么？”

"_While I was being_ _briefed before leaving, the Chairman said that you were trained under Colonel Quaritch's tutelage, in an advanced infantry course prior to your first assignment to NERV. He also said that you finished third in your class."_  
“在我出发前接受简报时，主席提到你在首次被分配到 NERV 之前，曾在夸利奇上校的指导下接受过高级步兵课程的训练。他还说你在班级中排名第三。”

"That's true," Misato admitted.  
“确实如此，”美里承认道。

"I didn't know that," Shinji said. "How can you—"  
"我不知道这些，" 真嗣说。"你怎么能——"

Misato held up a hand, cutting him off. "Listen."  
美里举起一只手，打断了他。“听着。”

"_I saw this man several times in the last three months, often with the Chairman, as_ _I guess that they were planning a big operation; they were talking things such as how many troops it would take to neutralize the Geofront. Besides, I'm sure you know him well because he's currently heading the largest private military company in the world, which is actually SEELE's private army."_  
“过去三个月里，我多次见到这个人，经常与董事长在一起，我猜他们正在策划一场大规模行动；他们讨论的事情包括需要多少部队才能中立化地底都市。此外，我确信你对他很熟悉，因为他目前领导着世界上最大的私人军事公司，实际上是 SEELE 的私人军队。”

"What do you know about this PMC?" Asuka questioned.  
“你对这家 PMC 了解多少？”明日香质问道。

"The last I heard," Misato said as she paused the video, "Global Protection Enterprises has an air force of their own, with lots of UCAVs and gunships, the centerpiece of which is their Dragon gunship and they have two dozen of them; next to that they have a full armored division, with tanks, APCs and all; and finally they have thousands of specially-trained men, most of them are former members of elite units. All in all, they're hardcore."  
“我上次听说，”美里暂停了视频，“全球保护企业有自己的空军，拥有大量无人战斗机和武装直升机，其中最引人注目的是他们的龙式武装直升机，他们有二十四架；除此之外，他们还有一个全副武装的装甲师，包括坦克、装甲运兵车等等；最后，他们有成千上万受过特殊训练的士兵，其中大多数是前精英部队的成员。总的来说，他们非常强悍。”

Asuka made a face. "Good God," she muttered before Misato resumed playback.  
明日香皱了皱眉。“天哪，”她低声嘀咕，随后美里继续播放视频。

"_Before I go to sleep, let me tell you something else, and it's personal. Through my special gift that I discovered, I was able to understand your own personalities, feelings, your weaknesses and strengths… everything that makes all of you so human. Human in the sense that there's still much good in the_ _lilin, contrary to my earlier views as them being condemnable. For the first time in my life, I discovered many things outside my world, where my eyes were opened to a new perspective, for good or for worse. Each of you may have suffered, but each of you can also have a chance to redeem yourselves, and to become better persons in the future… should there be a future for mankind, which you will have to defend with everything at your disposal._  
在我入睡之前，让我再告诉你一些事，这是私人的。通过我发现的特殊能力，我能够理解你们的个性、情感、弱点和强项……所有这些让你们如此人性化的特质。人性化意味着莉林仍有许多善良之处，这与我早先认为他们应受谴责的观点相反。在我的一生中，我第一次发现了我世界之外的许多事物，我的视野被打开，看到了一个新的视角，无论是好是坏。你们每个人都可能遭受过痛苦，但每个人也都有机会赎回自己，并在未来成为更好的人……如果有未来的人类，你们将不得不竭尽全力去捍卫。

"_I am very much aware that sooner or later I will die in this place after coming in terms with my destiny. Yet with my revelations about the lilin, I realized I have a potential of my own, I have a possibility that is waiting for me to ring true… Through Rei, I yearn to be a human, to be normal so that I can open my heart and my mind__… so that I can also love you as much as a lilin can."_  
我非常清楚，迟早我会在这个地方接受我的命运而死去。然而，通过对莉林的启示，我意识到我也有自己的潜力，有一种可能性在等待我去实现……通过丽，我渴望成为一个人类，变得正常，以便我能敞开心扉和思想……这样我也能像一个莉林一样深爱你。

Now Rei began to shed tears.  
现在丽开始流泪了。

"_It has become my destiny to meet you all, not as targets but as equals, and it's also fate that brought me to you, Ayanami. Yes, it's so strange that we were fated to meet once more, after what seemed to be more than a lifetime of being apart.__"_  
"与你们相遇已成为我的宿命，不是作为目标而是作为平等的存在，也是命运将我带到了你身边，绫波。是的，我们注定要在似乎是隔了一生之后再次相遇，这真是太奇妙了。__"

"Like the Tanabata," Rei whispered, using the sleeve of her robe to wipe the tears away.  
"就像七夕节一样，" 绫波低声说道，用她长袍的袖子擦去泪水。

"_Someday, if there_ _would be a someday, we could meet again under blue skies, when this world is at peace, in equilibrium, when we're past the time of_ koyanisquatsi_, or the Hopi Indians refer to 'life out of balance', caused by my masters... and of yours. But for now, there is no other way except to deal with the possible threat of extinction, and only all of you are the only ones who can save this world from the madness and nihilism of a few."_  
""如果有那么一天，我们能在蓝天之下再次相遇，当这个世界和平、平衡，当我们已经超越了‘koyanisquatsi’——霍皮印第安人所说的‘失衡的生活’，这是由我的主人和你们的主人造成的。但目前，除了应对可能的灭绝威胁之外，别无他法，只有你们所有人才能从少数人的疯狂和虚无主义中拯救这个世界。_"_

They nodded in agreement; Kaworu was right, even at the end.  
他们点头表示同意；碇真嗣说得没错，即便是在最后。

"_Until then, and should I am at the jaws of death, I'll cherish every moment I was with all of you__, and every minute of it… and to Rei… Thank you."_  
“直到那时，即使我身处死亡的边缘，我也会珍惜与你们在一起的每一刻，每一分钟……还有对绫波……谢谢你。”

Then it was over, the video quickly cutting to a black frame, before the laptop ejected the disc.  
然后一切结束了，视频迅速切换到黑屏，随后笔记本电脑弹出了光盘。

For a minute they said nothing, as if to let Kaworu's words settle into their minds.  
有那么一会儿，他们什么也没说，仿佛要让渚薰的话在他们心中沉淀。

"Maybe later," Misato said, breaking the silence for the first time. "I'll look for a chaplain to help us bless and bury Kaworu's arm, even if it's just a piece of him; all I want is to give him a proper funeral."  
“也许晚些时候吧，”美里第一次打破了沉默，“我会去找一位牧师来帮我们祝福并安葬渚薰的手臂，尽管那只是他的一部分；我只希望能给他一个体面的葬礼。”

The Children nodded in agreement.  
孩子们点头表示同意。

"Afterwards," Misato went on, "with little time left we have to get ourselves ready for the worst shitstorm in history, so you two will have to get into the simulators as the Evas undergo some repairs, okay?"  
"之后，" 美里继续说道，"我们剩下的时间不多了，得准备好面对史上最糟糕的风暴，所以你们两个得进入模拟器，因为 Eva 需要进行一些维修，好吗？"

"Okay," Asuka and Shinji replied in unison.  
"好的，" 明日香和真嗣齐声回答。

Misato sighed, wondering where and how she could fit Rei for some assignment, before she said, "I saw you levitate."  
美里叹了口气，思索着在哪里以及如何给绫波安排任务，然后她说道，"我看到你悬浮起来了。"

Rei nodded. "That is true."  
丽点点头。"那是真的。"

"Well, did Kaworu teach you how to use your AT-Field?" Misato questioned.  
"那么，渚薰教过你如何使用你的 AT 力场吗？"美里问道。"

"Yes." "是的。"

Misato thought for a moment, and then she said, "What else he did?"  
美里想了一会儿，然后她说："他还做了什么？"

"He used his AT-Field to blast his way through," Rei said.  
"他用 AT 力场炸开了一条路，" 绫波说。

"Like some shockwave of sorts?"  
"就像某种冲击波一样？"

"Yes… Why?" "是的……怎么了？"

"I'm thinking of some way for you to help us defend this place should things come to worse. You need a position to fill, but with that kind of humongous potential you could do with the AT-Field, who knows, it's possible you can be on equal footing with the Evas."  
"我在考虑如何让你在情况恶化时帮助我们保卫这个地方。你需要一个职位来填补，但凭借你那种巨大的 AT 力场潜力，谁知道呢，你或许能与 EVA 们平起平坐。"

Rei blinked. "Pardon me?"  
绫波零眨了眨眼。 "请再说一遍？"

Misato smiled. "You'll be our first line of defense, to scare the panties off our attackers."  
美里笑了笑。 "你将成为我们的第一道防线，吓得敌人尿裤子。"

The First Children had a double-take. "I apologize," she said, "but I do not understand about 'scaring the panties'; panties are not living things."  
第一代孩子们愣了一下。“我很抱歉，”她说，“但我对‘吓得尿裤子’这个说法不太理解；内裤并不是活物。”

Suddenly Misato and Asuka laughed out loudly, the first time after Kaworu's demise and thus shattering the somber mood that permeated their emotions throughout this morning.  
突然间，美里和明日香大声笑了出来，这是自渚薰死后她们第一次这样笑，打破了今早一直笼罩在她们情绪中的沉重气氛。

"It means that we scare them so bad they have to go back home to change their undies," Asuka reminded her between giggles. "Another idiom, Rei, that's another."  
“意思是我们把他们吓得够呛，以至于他们得回家换内裤，”明日香在笑声中提醒她。“又一个成语，丽，这是另一个。”

Shinji shook his head in jest. "She's still learning," he added, before Rei smiled softly.  
真嗣笑着摇了摇头。“她还在学习中，”他补充道，随后绫波温柔地微笑了。

---

Unknown to them, a figure staggered through the deserted hallway, having crawled himself out of the stairwell. He was completely naked, breathing and bleeding profusely, trying to keep himself upright and alert. As he walked slowly, he left a trail of blood, small spatters of them behind him.  
他们不知道，一个身影蹒跚地穿过空荡荡的走廊，从楼梯间爬了出来。他一丝不挂，呼吸急促，血流如注，努力保持直立和清醒。他缓慢地走着，身后留下了一串血迹，零星的血滴散落在他身后。

This person was on his last reserves of strength, and then he heard some laughter from a room two doors away, wondering if he was hearing things.  
这个人已经耗尽了最后一丝力气，这时他听到两扇门外的房间里传来笑声，不知道自己是不是产生了幻听。

No, the laughter was for real. That gave him more courage to keep on going until he stood before the lounge door, which had a small window and this allowed him to peer in; goodness, they were there, and with his right hand curled into a fist he repeatedly knocked on the glass.  
不，那笑声是真心的。这给了他更多的勇气继续前进，直到他站在休息室的门前，门上有一个小窗户，这让他得以窥视里面；天哪，他们就在那里，他用右手握成拳头，不断地敲打着玻璃。

"Who is it?" Misato called out as she walked over, before the bleeding person collapsed to the floor, his fingers raking the glass as he fell.  
“谁啊？”美里一边喊着一边走过来，就在这时，那个流血的人倒在了地板上，他的手指在玻璃上划过，随着他一起倒下。

"What the hell?" Misato stammered in complete shock after she opened the door, prompting the Children behind her to come and see what was going on  
“搞什么鬼？”美里在完全震惊中结巴地说道，她打开门后，身后的孩子们也跟着过来想看看发生了什么。

Much to their surprise, Kaworu was right before them, lying on the floor, barely conscious; his left shoulder was bleeding badly, even after he wrapped strips of cloth around the stump where his arm was used to be.  
令他们大为惊讶的是，渚薰就躺在他们面前，奄奄一息地躺在地板上；他的左肩严重出血，即便他用布条紧紧缠绕在原本手臂所在的地方。

Quickly they gathered around him, with Rei cradling his head onto her arms, Shinji embracing Asuka as she wept, and Misato held the boy's right hand.  
他们迅速围拢过来，绫波零将他的头抱在怀中，真嗣拥抱着哭泣的明日香，美里则握住男孩的右手。

"What did you do?" Rei cried, the girl now in anguish.  
“你做了什么？”绫波零哭喊道，此刻的她满是痛苦。

"I thought you were dead!" Asuka exclaimed. "I thought you—"  
"我以为你死了！" 明日香惊呼。"我以为你——"

"Ayanami, I told you before…" Kaworu gasped, before he swallowed hard, and then he grinned with tears in his eyes. "I told you… I can change the trajectory… No, my fate, really_… and I did_."  
"绫波，我之前告诉过你……" 渚薰喘息着，然后艰难地咽了口唾沫，眼中含泪地笑了。"我告诉过你……我能改变轨迹……不，我的命运，真的……我做到了。"

"How the hell did you do that?" Shinji questioned, almost outraged as Misato struggled to get her mobile phone out to call for help. "You damn scared me!"  
"你到底是怎么做到的？" 真嗣质问道，几乎有些愤怒，而美里正努力掏出手机呼叫救援。"你吓死我了！"

"Do you know of a man named Houdini?" Kaworu questioned.  
"你知道一个叫胡迪尼的人吗？" 渚薰问道。

Shinji blinked. "What?" 真嗣眨了眨眼。"什么？"

"Have you heard of him? Harry Houdini?"  
"你听说过他吗？哈里·胡迪尼？"

"No, I don't know him, but why?"  
"不，我不认识他，但为什么？"

Kaworu took a deep breath. "He was the best escape artist of his time; he misdirected his audience… making them see the other way around, to believe what they're seeing… when he pulled a trick on them." Kaworu then coughed. "That's what… I did, a _disappearing act_, to convince your father and the Chairman _to believe_ that I'm dead."  
渚薰深吸了一口气。"他当时是最出色的逃脱艺术家；他误导观众……让他们看到相反的方向，相信自己所见……当他向他们施展魔术时。"渚薰接着咳嗽了一声。"那就是……我所做的，一个消失的把戏，让你的父亲和主席相信我已经死了。"

"How?" Shinji asked. "怎么做到的？" 真嗣问道。

Kaworu smiled. "You may not believe me, but I generated a Sea of Dirac right under, and that's where I've gone to at the same moment Unit One closed in on me."  
渚薰微笑道：“你可能不信，但我确实在下面生成了一个狄拉克之海，就在初号机逼近我的那一刻，我便去了那里。”

They were astonished; they thought it to be impossible. "That's it?" Shinji asked.  
他们震惊不已，觉得这简直不可思议。“就这样？”真嗣问道。

"So it worked?" Misato asked after she talked to Ritsuko, who said that paramedics were now on their way.  
“所以成功了？”美里在与律子通话后问道，律子告诉她救护人员已经在路上了。

"Yeah… Doesn't matter, except what's important is that I'm here again now, okay?"  
“是啊……无所谓了，重要的是我现在又回来了，好吗？”

Shinji thought of it for a moment, and then said, "Thank you for coming back."  
真嗣想了一会儿，然后说道：“谢谢你回来。”

**Author's Notes:** How many days, months and years have passed since October 7, 2003?  
作者笔记：自 2003 年 10 月 7 日以来，已经过去了多少天、月和年？

Give or take, _seven years and ten months_.  
大约七年至十年。

Almost a lifetime, eh?  
几乎是一生，是吧？

That was the day I first started on this fic, seven days after my birthday, an idea hatched out of an inane online quiz, combined with the vision of Dante Alighieri's _Divine Comedy_; at that time my old friend was still alive as we ran the miniscule computer shop where we received orders for retyping and printing documents for three years; I was then in my prime, happy, hopeful and looking forward where our business venture would someday become as big as we dreamed.  
那是我开始写这篇同人文的日子，在我生日后的第七天，一个由无聊的在线测试引发的念头，结合了但丁·阿利吉耶里的《神曲》之景；那时，我的老朋友还健在，我们一起经营着那家微不足道的电脑店，三年来我们承接文档的重新录入和打印工作；我当时正值盛年，快乐、充满希望，期待着我们的生意有朝一日能如我们所梦想的那样壮大。

But that dream came to naught, for he died weeks later, and thereafter I had to endure this emptiness as things began to sour on me. Worse, almost a year later my ex-stepmother sold the computer at home because back then it was costing the household much money to pay for the electric bill, the most expensive rates in Asia, and thus my writing efforts almost came to naught, as I had to contend with a life of increased difficulty.  
但那个梦想化为泡影，因为他几周后去世了，此后我不得不忍受这种空虚，事情开始对我变得不利。更糟的是，几乎一年后，我的前继母卖掉了家里的电脑，因为当时高昂的电费成了家庭的沉重负担，那是亚洲最高的电费率，因此我的写作努力几乎化为乌有，我不得不面对生活日益增加的困难。

Yet I persevered, I kept the fic alive by thinking about it, even as days went by without a computer for which I could use, and even as I faced hell on a daily basis.  
然而我坚持不懈，我通过思考让这篇同人文得以延续，即使日子一天天过去，我没有电脑可用，即使我每天都在地狱中挣扎。

It wasn't until a year after my father's death that I was able to resume writing this piece, this time with a computer I was free to use, and with that the ideas and concepts came back rushing like a flood, committing them to every page, beginning with what is now Season Two, risking my neck and marching to hell without a pre-reader.  
直到父亲去世一年后，我才得以重新开始撰写这部作品，这次是用一台我可以自由使用的电脑，随之而来的想法和概念如洪水般涌回，倾注于每一页，从现在的第二季开始，冒着生命危险，在没有预读者的陪伴下向地狱进发。

To what credit should I owe for this revival? I should thank Stephen King for his priceless _On Writing_, which opened my mind and inspired me to new ideas for my fanfic_._  
我应该归功于谁的复兴呢？我要感谢斯蒂芬·金和他的无价之作《写作这回事》，它打开了我的思维，激发了我为同人小说创作新想法。

What about structure, plot and vision? I tip my hat off to none other than Christopher "Strike Fiss" Brumet, author of _Higher Learning_.  
至于结构、情节和视野呢？我要向克里斯托弗·“斯特莱克·菲斯特”·布鲁梅特致敬，他是《高等教育》一书的作者。

And finally there's a very long list of people whom I also pay homage to, for they have influenced my writing, imagination, and how I view Eva from many perspectives; I will reserve this list only after I finish the treacherous final season, which encompasses the entirety of _End of Eva_.  
最后，还有一长串我同样致敬的人，因为他们从多个角度影响了我的写作、想象力和对 Eva 的看法；我将保留这份名单，直到我完成那充满挑战的最终季，该季涵盖了《Eva 终》的全部内容。

_All right, all right…_ _Wait a minute, what about this chapter?_  
好吧，好吧……等等，这一章呢？

This chapter was done, like #39, in a space of two days after almost a week of letting some ideas – both old and new - percolate around my noggin before I pour them out onto the pages, but honestly writing the last three chapters was difficult, like blindly feeling my way around in an uncharted region; apart from being inspired by Queen's _Bohemian Rhapsody,_ I also incorporated snippets and rehashes of Episode 25 for Shinji's self-reflection, while listening to Yo-Yo Ma's rendition of _BWV 1007 (Suite Number One, Prelude in G Major)_.  
这一章和第 39 章一样，在两天内完成，之前几乎一周的时间里，我让一些旧的和新想法在我的脑海中酝酿，然后才将它们倾泻到纸上，但说实话，写最后三章很困难，就像在未知的领域中盲目摸索；除了受到皇后乐队的《波西米亚狂想曲》的启发外，我还融入了第 25 集的片段和重述，用于真嗣的自我反思，同时聆听着马友友演奏的 BWV 1007（第一号组曲，G 大调前奏曲）。

I tried my best to provide as much depth to the characters, both canon and of my creation, but I always reminded myself that the main characters are very important, and that there's always a line to be drawn between proper characterization and mis-characterization. Still, mistakes can sometimes happen, so I apologize for whatever possible imbalances that I may have committed to some characters, along with other flubs during the writing process.  
我尽力为所有角色，无论是原著中的还是我创造的，赋予了尽可能多的深度，但我始终提醒自己，主要角色至关重要，且在恰当的角色塑造与角色误解之间总有一条界线。尽管如此，错误有时仍会发生，因此我为可能对某些角色造成的任何不平衡以及其他写作过程中的失误表示歉意。

So before I go and once again, I want to say thanks to those who read, to those who gave their comments and criticisms, to those adding this story to their alerts, and to fellow writers who gave me challenges to think about.  
在我离开之前，再次感谢那些阅读的人，那些给予评论和批评的人，那些将这个故事加入提醒列表的人，以及那些给予我思考挑战的同行作家。

_May we live in interesting times__; J'ai ose._  
愿我们生活在有趣的时代；我敢于尝试。

### Chapter 41 Recovery

_Two organizations, both alike in dignity,  
两个组织，皆享有同等尊严，  
In fair Tokyo-3, where we lay our scene,  
在美丽的第三新东京市，我们展开故事，  
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,  
从古老的仇恨中爆发新的叛乱，_

_Where cabal blood makes cabal hands unclean.  
哪里有阴谋集团的血，哪里就有阴谋集团的脏手。  
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes  
从这两个宿敌致命的腰间  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers risk'd their life;  
一对命运多舛的恋人冒着生命危险；  
Whose adventur'd courage overthrows  
谁的冒险勇气将其推翻_

_Do with their togetherness end their masters' strife.  
以他们的团结结束主人的纷争。  
The fearful passage of their defy-mark'd love,  
他们那被抗拒标记的恐惧之旅，  
And the continuance of their rulers' rage,  
以及他们统治者愤怒的持续，  
Which, but their Children's end, naught could remove,  
除非终结他们的后代，否则无物能消除，_

_Is now several chapters' traffick of our tale;  
如今已成为我们故事中几章的交易；  
The which if you with patient eyes attend,  
若你以耐心的目光细看，  
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.  
此处若有遗漏，我们努力补全。_

_**About two billion years ago…  
大约二十亿年前……**_

Somewhere in a very remote region of the universe, billions of stony spheres were being readied to launch. They were clustered into a giant mass about one astronomical unit in radius, equivalent to Earth's orbital distance away from the Sun.  
在宇宙的某个极为偏远的区域，数十亿颗坚硬的球体正准备发射。它们聚集成一个巨大的质量，半径约为一个天文单位，相当于地球与太阳之间的轨道距离。

Each hollow sphere was about 13 kilometers in diameter, built out of the strongest and durable materials possible, and within this shell contained a humanoid lifeform, entombed in a block of ice, pierced by a dense metallic spear thrust into its heart.  
每个空心球体直径约 13 公里，由最坚固耐用的材料制成，球体内封存着一个人形生命体，被冰块包裹，心脏处刺入一根密集的金属长矛。

The mysterious, humanoid beings responsible for constructing those immense structures, and then gathering them into this cluster of mammoth proportions, stood in the control center at the very nexus of this mass, were glad to see that their life's work was done, a product of many minds and disciplines.  
那些神秘的人形生物，负责建造这些庞大的结构，并将它们聚集成如此巨大的集群，站在这一质量中心的控制室内，欣慰地看到他们毕生的工作已完成，这是众多智慧与学科的结晶。

Yet they were very aware that sooner or later, their race would become a memory, to be forgotten amongst the stars, for they were at the apex of their civilization, but fast approaching the end of their lives after millions of years of existence. At the same time, however, the spheres they have created carried little information, save for a large stone tablet and a very long scroll that was placed below the life-form's icy prison, both objects intended to be the overall documentation that explained how and why they were created; its makers hoped that someone in a very distant future, would read them and understand, to remind their creations of their past history.  
然而，他们深知早晚有一天，自己的种族将成为历史，湮没于星辰之间，因为他们正处于文明的巅峰，却也正迅速走向数百万年存在的尽头。与此同时，他们创造的球体所携带的信息寥寥无几，仅有一块巨大的石碑和一卷长长的卷轴，置于生命形态冰封监狱之下，这两件物品旨在作为整体记录，解释它们的起源与目的；制造者希望在遥远的未来，有人能阅读它们并理解，以此提醒他们的造物记住过往的历史。

The beings stood tall before the holographic displays, watched as the last few concentrated amounts of energy were being charged into the spheres, while one of those beings sat in a chair, his finger poised over a button. Another display depicted the probable trajectories of each and every sphere, designating them to a sector of the universe, having preselected the stellar systems, and hence, planets to which the spheres would be implanted into.  
这些生物站在全息显示器前，注视着最后几股浓缩能量被注入球体，其中一位坐在椅子上，手指悬停在按钮上方。另一显示器描绘了每个球体可能的轨迹，将它们指定到宇宙的各个区域，预先选定了恒星系统，从而确定了球体将被植入的行星。

Once the spheres were fully charged, the leader of the beings nodded to the chair-bound subordinate to launch all of the spheres, and he, in turn pressed the button.  
一旦球体完全充电，这些生物的领袖便向被束缚在椅子上的下属点头示意，让他发射所有球体，而他随即按下了按钮。

In a second, the orbs flew away at astonishing speeds and in multiple directions, to destinations unknown, but their purpose was to propagate life to as many worlds as possible.  
转眼间，这些球体以惊人的速度向多个方向飞去，前往未知的目的地，但它们的目的在于尽可能多地向各个世界传播生命。

This process was called _transpermia_.  
这一过程被称为跨星球生命传播。

After the spheres disappeared into space, the leader hoped that their creations, leaping through millions of light years for every second of their flight, would become successful upon landing on a remote, habitable planet, and someday thank them for their existence and for the gift of life.  
在球体消失于太空之后，领导者希望他们的创造物，每飞行一秒便跨越数百万光年，能在降落于一个遥远且适宜居住的星球上时取得成功，并终有一天感谢他们的存在以及赋予生命的恩赐。

What these mysterious beings have not foreseen, however, was the possibility that in the distant future their creations may not be as thankful as they wished, may surpass them in knowledge, and instead abuse their sacred gifts for their own selfish ends.  
然而，这些神秘生物未曾预见到的是，在遥远的未来，他们的创造物可能并不如他们所愿那般感恩，甚至可能在知识上超越他们，转而滥用这些神圣的礼物以满足自己的私欲。

_**Now.**_

I am here, for a reason, a quirk of fate that brought me into this place.  
我来到这里，有其原因，命运的偶然将我带入此地。

I was made as a perfect weapon, a sentient, genetically-engineered instrument of a man's will, possessing the body of a man but with the organs of an Angel, I was trained to use the powers I have since birth, and then later given orders on my fifteenth year, and sent as a creditor to make another man pay for his mistakes.  
我被制造成为一件完美的武器，一个具有自我意识、基因工程打造的工具，承载着一个人的意志，拥有人类的躯体却内藏天使的器官。我自出生起便被训练运用这些天赋，并在十五岁那年接到命令，被派遣去让另一个男人为其错误付出代价。

They intend me to die, to fulfill their prophecy, a signal that humanity will be subjugated and integrated into a single organism where God, man and everything will be _one_.  
他们意图让我死去，以实现他们的预言，一个标志着人类将被征服并融入单一有机体的信号，届时神、人与万物将合而为一。

But when I came here… well, suffice to say my life was not the same anymore, for I have become friends with some of the most imperfect people I have ever seen.  
但当我来到这里……好吧，可以说我的生活从此不再相同，因为我结识了一些我所见过的最不完美的人。

They were called the Children.  
他们被称为孩子们。

Like me. 像我一样。

---

Rei Ayanami. 绫波零。

The First Children. 最初的孩子们。

Beautiful. Mysterious. Soft-spoken.  
美丽。神秘。轻声细语。

Yet on the first day we met she wore an expressionless mask on her face, and so I could only think she was a girl who never dreamed, cold, almost spectral, mechanical in action and also unfeeling.  
然而在我们相遇的第一天，她脸上戴着一副无表情的面具，以至于我只能认为她是一个从不做梦、冷漠、近乎幽灵般、行动机械且无情无感的女孩。

But she was then the property of then-Commander Ikari, the puppeteer, the Svengali whom my former master wanted him to be punished for his transgressions. Therefore her purpose in this world was to follow Ikari's orders to the letter, even if asked to die on his behalf.  
但那时她属于当时的指挥官碇源堂，这位操纵者、斯文加利式的人物，我的前主人希望他因自己的罪行受到惩罚。因此，她在这个世界上的使命就是严格遵循碇源堂的命令，即使被要求为他而死。

And last week her second iteration, no, I mean, her second clone died along with one of my brethren, sacrificing herself so that she thought will deny the Angel from tormenting Shinji any further.  
而上星期，她的第二个复制体，不，我是说，她的第二个克隆体和我的一个同胞一起牺牲了，她以为这样就能阻止使徒继续折磨真嗣。

Afterwards, the Rei that was presented to him wasn't her at all, but again a puppet.  
之后，出现在他面前的丽根本不是她，而是一个傀儡。

That, and the clones of her, broke Shinji's faith in her almost completely, for through their interaction since he first arrived, without the manipulation of his father, Shinji shaped her second iteration into almost an authentic person, a girl with a heart, soul and mind.  
这，以及她的克隆体们，几乎彻底摧毁了真嗣对她的信任，因为在他的父亲没有操纵的情况下，自从他第一次来到这里，通过他们的互动，真嗣将她的第二个复制体塑造成了一个近乎真实的人，一个有心、有灵魂和思想的女孩。

The Third, which the present iteration of Rei then called herself, was a blank slate, devoid of the things that made the second Rei a little more human.  
第三代绫波，即当时的她自称的那个，是一张白纸，缺乏了使第二代绫波稍显人性的那些特质。

Once again she became a puppet, and Ikari confidently thought she would stay that way till the end.  
她再次变成了一个傀儡，而碇司令自信地认为她会一直这样直到最后。

That is, until I came into her life and saw that inside, just beneath her seemingly unfeeling exterior, she was asking for help.  
也就是说，直到我走进她的生活，发现在她看似无情的表面之下，她其实在寻求帮助。

---

The Second Children. 第二适格者。

Asuka Langley Soryu. 惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

Fiery and determined, reckless and haughty, and full of arrogance, she was the extrovert of the team. Smart, talented and beautiful, she had those blazing blue eyes... and a sharp tongue.  
她热情而坚定，鲁莽且高傲，充满傲气，是团队中的外向者。聪明、有才华且美丽，她拥有那双炽热的蓝眼睛……以及一张利嘴。

That was her back then, back before the Fifteenth Angel decided it best to punish her completely by throwing back into her mind all of the things she hated and feared, with a brutal psychic assault that she almost lost her mind, as though she was raped and violated on contact.  
那是她曾经的模样，在那第十五使徒决定最好彻底惩罚她之前，将所有她憎恨和恐惧的事物一股脑儿地抛回她的脑海，进行了一场几乎让她精神崩溃的残酷心灵攻击，仿佛在接触的那一刻就被强暴和侵犯。

Especially her worst nightmare: the suicide of her mother, right before her very eyes, as a child.  
尤其是她最深的噩梦：在她还是个孩子时，亲眼目睹母亲自杀。

That really wrecked her will to live, that a few days later she almost died by her hand, naked and her wrists bleeding in a tub half-full of water, inside a half-wrecked abandoned house.  
那件事彻底摧毁了她活下去的意志，几天后她几乎亲手结束了自己的生命，赤裸着，手腕流血，躺在一个半满水的浴缸里，身处一栋半毁的废弃房屋中。

You wonder why Asuka's such a stubborn girl back then: she's extroverted because it's her way to forget the trauma she suffered from, and she sought to have the world revolve around her.  
你好奇为什么那时候明日香那么固执：她外向是因为这是她忘记所受创伤的方式，她试图让世界围绕她转。

How that Angel made her face the music, and almost turned her into a statistic.  
那个使徒让她面对现实，差点让她成为统计数据中的一员。

So by the time I first saw her at the Infirmary, after my initial checkup, that's when I found her lying in bed, in her chemical sleep and due to be shipped back to where she came from, but not back home.  
所以当我第一次在医务室见到她时，经过初步检查后，我看到她躺在床上，处于化学睡眠状态，即将被送回她来的地方，但不是回家。

A few nights later I paid her a visit in her dreams, and told her to wake up, to think over about herself.  
几天后的一个夜晚，我在她的梦中拜访了她，告诉她醒来，好好思考一下自己。

And she came back, but as a better person.  
她回来了，但变成了一个更好的人。

Finally, the star of the show; my brother of the heart, so as to speak…  
最后，这位节目的明星；可以说是我心灵上的兄弟……

Shinji Ikari. 碇真嗣。

The first time I came upon him, just as I was humming to myself, on a late afternoon, he was melancholic, as if he'd lost almost everything he held dear.  
我第一次遇见他时，正自顾自地哼着小曲，那是一个傍晚时分，他显得忧郁，仿佛失去了他所珍视的一切。

Yes, indeed, he was almost a broken man.  
是的，确实如此，他几乎是个心碎的人。

Now, how can this person, purportedly the one to save humanity, couldn't be happy?  
那么，这个据说是拯救人类的人，为何无法快乐呢？

I was aware of the grave weight thrown upon his shoulders, the pressure right on him to fulfill his role as a hero to most, the celebrated Third Children.  
我深知那沉重负担压在他肩上，他承受着成为多数人心目中的英雄——备受赞誉的第三适格者的巨大压力。

But he had nothing: his mother was long dead (save for her soul residing in Unit-01); his father was an obsessed man who ruled with an iron fist, single-minded in getting his long-gone wife back from the beyond. As if that wasn't enough, Shinji's upbringing by his distant relatives resulted in a personality quite introverted, preferring the contentment of a quiet life, wishing to be normal, not wanting any trouble.  
但他一无所有：母亲早已离世（仅剩灵魂寄居于初号机中）；父亲是个执迷不悟的铁腕统治者，一心只想从彼岸找回早已逝去的妻子。更甚者，真嗣由疏远的亲戚抚养长大，形成了相当内向的性格，他渴望宁静的生活，向往平凡，不愿招惹任何麻烦。

Yet at present, his severe circumstances as the pilot of Eva Unit-01 prevent him from attaining that ideal life. So he had no choice, and seeing that I have presented myself as a friend, someone who could understand him, on that first day he became my younger brother.  
然而，作为初号机驾驶员的严峻处境使他无法实现理想生活。因此他别无选择，既然我自荐为理解他的朋友，在那第一天，他便成了我的弟弟。

From there, I had to teach him whatever it takes to become a genuine person, to open his heart, to persuade him to deal with personal issues on his own. Little by little, he regained some of his former courage whilst he forged new relationships with Rei and Asuka, before he fell in love with the latter, and then above all, he improved himself in even a short time.  
从那时起，我必须教会他如何成为一个真正的人，敞开心扉，说服他自己解决个人问题。渐渐地，他在与丽和明日香建立新关系的同时，找回了部分昔日的勇气，并在爱上明日香之后，甚至在短时间内提升了自己。

He was now a far cry from the runaway boy he once used to be.  
他现在与曾经那个逃跑的男孩相去甚远。

And I'm very proud of him, especially after he'd just passed the final test that I gave to him.  
我为他感到非常骄傲，尤其是在他刚刚通过了我的最终测试之后。

---

As for me, well, I've changed my mind and purpose.  
至于我，嗯，我已经改变了我的想法和目的。

I'm no longer the subjugator whose mission was to strike fear in the hearts of men. Nor I'm destined to die according to prophecy. I have defied those roles, having been awakened to the plight of my fellow Children, and the people closest to them.  
我不再是那个以恐吓人心为使命的征服者，也不再注定要按照预言死去。我已摒弃了这些角色，因为我觉醒了对我的同胞及其亲近之人的苦难。

Instead, my role would become the Angelic ambassador to humanity, to teach them the error of their ways and realize their mistakes, and to guide them to a new renaissance.  
相反，我的角色将成为天使与人类之间的使者，教导他们认识自己的错误，并引导他们走向新的复兴。

But not before we have to confront the coming Armageddon that could decide the fate of humanity, and maybe the universe.  
但在我们不得不面对可能决定人类乃至宇宙命运的末日之战前，还有许多事情要做。

So we'll have to deal with it, to bring about the end, not by Lorenz's method of false salvation, nor through Gendo Ikari's demented vision, but on _our_ _own_ _terms_.  
因此，我们必须应对这一挑战，终结这一切，不是通过洛伦兹那种虚假的救赎方式，也不是遵循碇源堂疯狂的愿景，而是按照我们自己的条件。

Because humanity, even if its population has been cut in half, still in suffering and divided over what should be best for the rest, still has the possibility of a second chance, and that's what I've came to believe in. Hence, we'll be fighting for all we value in humanity as unlikely _bodhisattva._  
因为即使人口减半，人类仍在痛苦中分裂，争论何为对余下之人最有利，他们仍有可能获得第二次机会，这正是我所坚信的。因此，我们将作为不太可能的菩萨，为人类所珍视的一切而战。

I am Kaworu Nagisa, otherwise known as Tabris, the Seventeenth Angel, and we know that, for the final act on the stage of the world, our audience is waiting for us to perform under the spotlight.  
我是渚薰，亦被称为第十七使徒塔布里斯，我们知道，在这世界的舞台上，最后一幕即将上演，观众正期待我们在聚光灯下展现。

Being weakened almost by the loss of blood following his earlier self-amputation, Kaworu could barely hear the clanging of the gurney that borne him, as the paramedics pushed it hard and fast on the tiled floor, on their way to the Infirmary.  
由于先前自我截肢导致的失血过多，几乎虚弱的 Kaworu 几乎听不见担架的叮当声，医护人员在瓷砖地板上用力快速地推着他，赶往医务室。

He would sometimes open his eyes, to see the overhead lights flash by, before his ears could hear the urgent voices surrounding him, and then heard the gurney slam through the double doors, into the emergency room.  
他有时会睁开眼睛，看到头顶的灯光一闪而过，随后才听到周围急促的呼喊声，接着是担架床猛地穿过双开门，进入急诊室。

Half-dazed, he felt the oxygen mask being strapped to his mouth and nose, and this time, even with the overriding sound of his own breathing, he thought he heard familiar, feminine voices; it was them, all right; he was now surely in good hands.  
半昏迷中，他感觉到氧气面罩被固定在嘴和鼻子上，这一次，尽管自己的呼吸声占据了主导，他还是觉得听到了熟悉的女声；没错，就是她们；他现在肯定在可靠的人手中。

Opening his eyes again, almost barely, he could see Ritsuko's face swim into view, and there was the bright head of the penlight dancing round each of his eyes, as though making sure he was still alive.  
再次睁开眼睛，几乎勉强，他能看到赤木律子的脸浮现在眼前，还有那支明亮的笔灯在他每只眼睛周围跳动，仿佛在确认他是否还活着。

There was a second voice… Yes, it was Doctor Odani, whom he dined and drank with last night, and now he heard them talking about getting a packet of blood or two, with the correct blood type, and then she mentioned about his arm.  
还有另一个声音……是的，那是昨天晚上与他共进晚餐的碇医生，现在他听到他们在讨论要拿一两包血袋，还得是正确的血型，然后她提到了他的手臂。

More precisely, his missing left arm, the one he intentionally cut off in the few milliseconds just before Unit-01 almost crushed him to pulp, just like the way a lizard auto-severed its tail when experiencing great danger, and he felt a few sharp jabs to his right shoulder, probably a syringe or the needle for the intravenous line; must be the anti-tetanus shot or dextrose or a blood transfusion.  
更确切地说，是他缺失的左臂，那只他在零号机几乎将他碾成肉泥前的几毫秒内故意切断的手臂，就像蜥蜴在遭遇巨大危险时自动断尾一样，接着他感到右肩上有几次尖锐的刺痛，可能是注射器或静脉输液针；应该是破伤风抗毒素注射或葡萄糖输液，甚至是输血。

And then there was something else with the oxygen he was breathing in; it was making him sleepy that within twenty seconds Kaworu sank into unconsciousness.  
然后，他吸入的氧气中似乎掺杂了其他东西；这让他昏昏欲睡，不出二十秒，真嗣便陷入了昏迷。

---

With Kaworu completely sedated, his vital signs almost all right, and the severed arteries and veins clamped down and sealed temporarily, Ritsuko Akagi, dressed again in surgical greens, now turned her attention to the left arm lying deep in the insulated cooler, still preserved with the help of dry ice.  
随着碇真嗣完全被麻醉，生命体征基本稳定，断裂的动静脉被夹紧并暂时封闭，赤木律子再次穿上手术服，将注意力转向那只深藏在保温箱中的左臂，臂上仍借助干冰保持着保存状态。

The operating room was filled with the sounds of the life-support systems, and with the rhythmic beeping of the ECG monitor. Surrounding and flanking her were Maya, Natsumi, and two more nurses, also dressed in greens.  
手术室内充满了生命维持系统的声音，以及心电监护仪有节奏的哔哔声。在她周围和两侧，是同样身着绿色手术服的伊吹玛亚、夏美和另外两名护士。

On close examination of the severed arm, Ritsuko figured that even with some damage it still might be possible to reattach the muscles and set the bone back in, before welding them together with a low-power surgical laser, and then stitching the skin together the traditional way.  
经过仔细检查断臂，赤木律子认为尽管有些损伤，但仍有可能重新连接肌肉并复位骨骼，然后使用低功率手术激光将其焊接在一起，最后以传统方式缝合皮肤。

It might take her three hours or so, she decided, but maybe more time.  
她估计大约需要三个小时，或许更久。

"Okay, Maya," she said to the younger woman standing a feet away from her, also in surgical greens. "Hand me over the arm."  
“好的，真希波，”她对站在一英尺外的年轻女子说道，对方同样身着手术服。“把那只手臂递给我。”

Without saying a word, strongly braving the sight and the touch of holding a severed human limb with her gloved hands, Maya gently lifted the arm out of the cooler, went over to Ritsuko and passed it to her, before the scientist laid the arm directly aligned to the bloody stump.  
真希波一言不发，勇敢地面对着视觉和触觉上的挑战，用戴着手套的双手稳稳地拿起那只断臂，轻轻地从冷藏箱中取出，走到律子身边，递给了她，随后科学家将手臂准确地对准了血淋淋的残肢。

She then carefully removed the clamps that kept the major blood vessels from leaking, and pushed the arm, no more than a couple of millimeters, when without warning, arm and stump welded and kneaded themselves back in one in a blink of an eye, and what was once a near-hopeless case of amputation was whole again.  
她随后小心翼翼地移除了固定主要血管以防泄漏的夹子，当她轻轻推动那只手臂，仅移动了几毫米，就在毫无预警之下，手臂与残肢瞬间融合，眨眼间便恢复如初，原本近乎无望的截肢案例竟奇迹般地完好无损。

Like magic. 宛如魔法。

In their quick astonishment, they all almost dropped everything they held.  
在他们的惊愕之中，所有人都几乎失手掉落了手中的物品。

"Hey, did you see that?" Natsumi remarked, her eyes blinking.  
"嘿，你看到了吗？" 娜兹咪说道，眼睛眨了眨。

"A… Amazing!" Maya stammered.  
"真…真是惊人！" 真嗣结巴道。

Ritsuko nodded. "Yes, it's instantaneous regeneration. After all, he's partly an Angel, but let's wait for a moment or two."  
律子点头道："是的，这是瞬间再生。毕竟他部分是使徒，不过我们还是稍等片刻吧。"

For a few minutes they observed Kaworu until Ritsuko made a few final checks and she figured that the Fifth Children's body had normalized enough that they can now set their equipment aside and send him to the first available ward.  
他们观察了 Kaworu 几分钟，直到 Ritsuko 完成了最后的检查，她判断第五适格者的身体已经恢复正常，可以撤掉设备，将他送往第一个可用的病房。

Once they watched the boy being carted away by the orderlies, the trio threw away their surgical gloves into a medical waste bin, took some time to wash their hands for five minutes, before Ritsuko went over to the speakerphone and dialed Fuyutsuki's number.  
目送男孩被护工推走后，三人将手术手套扔进医疗废物箱，花了五分钟仔细洗手，随后 Ritsuko 走到扬声电话前，拨通了 Fuyutsuki 的号码。

"Yes, Doctor?" the old man said after a moment.  
“是的，博士？”片刻后，老人回应道。

"Kaworu's all right, sir," Ritsuko replied confidently. "He's now in stable condition. We got his arm back in no time, but no surgery needed."  
"Kaworu 没事，长官，" 赤木律子自信地回答，"他现在状况稳定。我们很快就将他的手臂接回去了，但不需要手术。"

"What?" "什么？"

Ritsuko smiled. "I mean, his arm immediately reattached to his body, sir, so this one's gonna be for the books, as far as regenerative medicine is concerned."  
赤木律子微笑道："我的意思是，他的手臂立刻就重新接回身体了，长官，就再生医学而言，这绝对会成为记录在案的案例。"

"Excellent," the old man approved. "For the time being, Doctor, let him have his rest, but as for you, I need your presence for the emergency meeting at seven o'clock sharp, in Conference Room Five."  
"很好，" 老人赞许道，"目前来说，医生，让他好好休息，但至于你，我需要你七点整准时出席在五号会议室的紧急会议。"

Ritsuko glanced at the clock affixed to the wall; it was almost six in the morning. "Okay, sir. I'll be there in a moment."  
律子瞥了一眼墙上挂着的时钟；快到早上六点了。“好的，先生。我马上就到。”

"Thank you, Doctor." “谢谢你，博士。”

Once he put down the phone's receiver, Fuyutsuki, the former professor of Metabiology and now the new NERV Commander, sighed and swiveled his seat with a hundred-eighty turn to peer outside the windows, which afforded him the view of the Geofront grounds. Right at this moment, the surviving light-receiving blocks swiveled to face the morning sun, reflecting and diverting the light to reach this way down below, illuminating the dome-like interior.  
放下电话听筒后，曾任元渡教授、如今新任 NERV 指挥官的冬月叹了口气，一百八十度旋转座椅，望向窗外，那里可以俯瞰到 Geofront 的地面。就在此刻，幸存的光接收块转向晨曦，反射并引导光线向下，照亮了穹顶般的内部空间。

But even now, the hundreds of tall buildings that crashed on the grounds after Unit-00 detonated herself, still remained standing over the conifers, the ferroconcrete derelicts reminded him of the city's short-lived glory as a model for urban development and disaster management.  
但即便如今，数百座高耸的建筑在零号机自爆后轰然倒地，依旧屹立在针叶林之上，这些钢筋混凝土的废墟让他想起了这座城市作为城市发展和灾难管理典范的短暂辉煌。

Now he thought of his newly-elevated status, which he personally did not craved for the power it brought him, but he obtained it without ceremony or fanfare for a far more important purpose.  
现在他想到自己新晋的地位，他个人并不渴望随之而来的权力，但他无仪式、无喧嚣地获得了它，是为了一个更为重要的目的。

With his new rank came the supreme amount of responsibility needed to manage some 9,745 people under his direct command, a veritable melting pot of nationalities, almost more than half of them were combatants, some with actual military experience apart from their college degrees, but the remainder consisted of civilian contractors whom he may have to issue an evacuation order for their safety later on.  
随着新职位的到来，他肩负起了管理直接指挥下的约 9,745 人的巨大责任，这是一个名副其实的民族大熔炉，其中几乎一半以上是战斗人员，有些除了大学学位外还有实际的军事经验，但其余的则是他可能需要为他们的安全发布疏散令的民间承包商。

As he still was on edge and thus unable to sleep, Fuyutsuki picked up a fresh bottle of Lipovitan, a popular energy tonic good for extending his stamina, on the desk and twisted the cap open, and he wondered how things would look like after twenty-four hours.  
由于他仍处于紧张状态，无法入睡，冬月拿起桌上一瓶新的 Lipovitan，这是一种流行的能量滋补品，有助于延长他的耐力，拧开瓶盖，他不禁思索二十四小时后事态会如何发展。

Given Keel's clout, it could be hell on earth, brimstone, fire and all.  
鉴于基尔的影响力，那可能是地狱般的景象，硫磺、火焰一应俱全。

Discomfited by the thought, Fuyutsuki took the bottle to his lips and drank. Even at this point, as he felt the liquid tonic go down his gullet, he'll have to face a very long day ahead.  
想到这里，冬月感到不安，他将瓶口凑到唇边喝了一口。即便在此时，随着滋补液流入喉咙，他仍需面对一个漫长的一天。

Now he imagined how Winston Churchill once experienced, his country almost on the brink of being overwhelmed and defeated by the Nazis, what it took to command a small band of defenders with whatever scant war materiel available, whilst hoping for any help from a friendly neighbor, no matter how distant, no matter how forlorn their situation.  
此刻，他想象着温斯顿·丘吉尔曾经的经历，他的国家几乎濒临被纳粹击溃和征服的边缘，指挥着一小队守卫者，用尽一切微薄的战争物资，同时期盼着任何来自友好邻邦的援助，无论多么遥远，无论处境多么绝望。

Thinking about that defiant Briton somehow reinvigorated Fuyutsuki; figuratively he was now in that great leader's shoes, except for this time his task was to lead the defense of humanity from total annihilation, even with no other external help at all.  
想到那位不屈不挠的英国人，不知怎的让冬月重新振作起来；从某种意义上说，他现在正站在那位伟大领袖的立场上，只是这一次，他的任务是领导人类抵御彻底的毁灭，即使没有任何外部援助。

So the first thing he did was to turn on his computer, went online and on a website found Churchill's famous wartime speeches for himself to read and be inspired, including _Blood,_ _Toil,_ _Tears_ _and_ _Sweat._  
于是，他首先打开电脑，上网在一个网站上找到了丘吉尔著名的战时演讲，自己阅读并从中获得灵感，包括《热血、辛劳、眼泪和汗水》。

With Kaworu inside the room, lying in rest, Ritsuko was talking to Misato in the hallway, reporting to her the details of the operation, including the unexpected rejoining of Kaworu's nearly-lost arm.  
房间内，渚薰静静地躺着休息，而赤木律子在走廊上向美里汇报手术细节，包括渚薰几乎失去的手臂意外重新接合的情况。

"Although he bled a great deal, I'd say his biological makeup did the rest of the work," the scientist said. "Suffice to say that it would've taken much longer, along with the recovery thereafter, which could've taken a month without complications caused by infections, which often happens with reattachment surgery."  
“虽然他流了很多血，但我认为他的生物结构完成了剩下的工作，”科学家说道，“简而言之，这会比正常情况下快得多，而且后续恢复也会更快，如果没有感染等并发症的话，通常再植手术后需要一个月才能恢复。”

"How long before he can be released?" Misato asked.  
“他还需要多久才能出院？”美里问道。

"Given his rate of regeneration, I'd say five to six hours, but maybe even less as the effects of anesthesia will wear off over time and could wake up at any moment."  
"考虑到他的再生速度，我估计需要五到六个小时，但随着麻醉效果逐渐消退，他可能会随时醒来。"

"Okay." “好的。”

"Now, except for Rei inside, where's the other Children?" Ritsuko questioned. Misato accompanied the First Children to let her keep watch on Kaworu, and from time to time, through the window she glanced at Rei sitting right besides Kaworu's bed.  
"现在，除了丽在里面，其他孩子们在哪里？" 律子问道。美里陪同第一适格者，让她监视着渚薰，并不时透过窗户瞥向坐在渚薰床边的丽。

"They're sleeping right now in my quarters. They haven't got any decent rest since around two o'clock."  
"他们现在在我的房间里睡觉。自从两点钟左右以来，他们一直没有好好休息过。"

"Oh, I see… and another thing," Ritsuko said. "By seven there will be an emergency meeting."  
"哦，我明白了……还有一件事，"赤木律子说。"七点钟将召开紧急会议。"

"Yeah, I know," Misato replied matter-of-factly. "I overheard him earlier. Every department head, including you and me, and then by nine the Commander will have everyone gathered at the auditorium."  
"嗯，我知道，"美里平静地回答。"我之前听到了。每个部门负责人，包括你和我，然后九点钟司令会召集大家在礼堂集合。"

Ritsuko made a face on the mere mention of the word _Commander_.  
一提到“司令”这个词，赤木律子就皱起了眉头。

"What's wrong?" Misato asked, taking note of her friend's disgusted expression.  
"怎么了？" 美里问道，注意到她朋友厌恶的表情。

"Sorry, I think I'll have to get used to Fuyutsuki being our _new_ Commander," Ritsuko said. "In any case, I'm sure he'll be on a lookout for any ideas on how to defend this place, should things come to worse, and I think you still have the moxie for this kind of thing. Remember when you guys were on that aircraft carrier, paying Asuka a visit back then? When you had Shinji and the boys brought over for the front-seat action?"  
"抱歉，我想我得习惯冬月成为我们的新指挥官，" 律子说。"无论如何，我相信他会密切关注任何保卫这个地方的想法，如果情况恶化的话，而且我认为你仍然有这种胆识。还记得你们在那艘航空母舰上，去看望明日香的时候吗？那时你把真嗣和男孩们带过来参与前线行动？"

"Yeah, marlin fishing," Misato said, before they laughed for a brief while, until her facial expression turned serious. "You know, I've read _The__Art_ _of_ _War_ many times."  
"是啊，就像钓马林鱼，" 美里说，然后她们短暂地笑了一会儿，直到她的表情变得严肃。"你知道，我读过《孙子兵法》很多遍。"

"And what parts of that book you'll use for this contingency?"  
"那本书的哪些部分你会用于这次紧急情况？"

"Because we're more on the defensive, we might as well to dig in deeper, as that old tactician says... and I have a lot of ideas."  
"因为我们更偏向于防守，不妨深入挖掘，正如那位老战术家所说……我有很多想法。"

In the staging base at Siberia, they were loading the Mass Production Evas onto the flying-wing Neo Point carriers, nine of them with more wingspan than Howard Hughes' H-4 _Spruce_ _Goose_, but built out of aerospace alloys and carbon fiber, and fitted with powerful jet engines twice as large as those used on the Airbus A380 airliners. But those carriers were unmanned, to be commanded by direct link with an orbiting SEELE-controlled satellite.  
在西伯利亚的集结基地，他们正将量产型 EVA 装载到飞翼式的新点航母上，九架翼展超过霍华德·休斯的 H-4 云杉鹅，但由航空合金和碳纤维制成，并配备了比空客 A380 客机所用引擎大两倍的强大喷气发动机。但这些航母是无人的，将通过与轨道上 SEELE 控制的卫星直接连接来指挥。

Carefully each of the Evas were secured in frames as they were being attached under the carriers' fuselage, until the interlocks snapped into place, allowing the frames to be removed.  
每台 Eva 都被小心翼翼地固定在框架中，随后这些框架被安装到运输机的机身下，直到锁定装置咔嗒一声到位，框架才被移除。

Because of their wingspan and weight, the runways had to be widened, lengthened and made thick enough to accommodate those carriers, and in this case the two main runways ran to six kilometers in length, just enough for the craft to claw their way to the sky, even with the use of mounted booster rockets to increase takeoff thrust.  
由于翼展和重量的原因，跑道必须加宽、延长并加厚，以适应这些运输机。在这种情况下，两条主跑道延长至六公里，刚好足够这些飞行器借助安装的助推火箭增加起飞推力，奋力升空。

The rest of the airbase was occupied by huge Antonov An-124 military cargo planes, Ilyushin Il-78 tankers, smaller Scorpion and huge Dragon gunships, the latter with their bellies soon to be filled with manned infantry support AMP suits, to be dropped on a hot landing zone. The AMP suits were a potent part of the overall assault inventory, essentially powered armor that can carry countless configurations of heavy machine guns, cannons, missiles, mortars and grenades.  
空军基地的其他部分则被巨大的安东诺夫 An-124 军用运输机、伊柳辛 Il-78 加油机、较小的蝎子和庞大的龙式武装直升机占据，后者腹部很快将装载有人驾驶的步兵支援 AMP 装甲，准备投放到热点登陆区。AMP 装甲是整体突击装备中的强大组成部分，本质上是一种动力装甲，能够搭载无数重型机枪、火炮、导弹、迫击炮和榴弹的配置。

From atop the operations building, and enjoying his morning tea while watching the heavy activity on the tarmac, Keel Lorenz, wearing his favorite overcoat, felt he was in better spirits than at any time of his life, and why not? Everything, he told himself, was in his favor: they had the most number of Evas, the better amount of firepower and manpower, the total control they had, and therefore he was confident that NERV will have little chance of success.  
从指挥大楼顶层，一边品着早茶，一边俯瞰着跑道上繁忙的景象，穿着他最喜爱的风衣的基尔·洛伦兹，感觉自己比任何时候都要心情舒畅，何尝不是呢？他自言自语，一切都在他这边：他们拥有最多的 Eva，更强大的火力和人力，完全的控制权，因此他确信 NERV 几乎没有成功的机会。

Only twenty-four hours from now, and then the final victory: total utopia.  
只需再过二十四小时，然后就是最终的胜利：完美的乌托邦。

"May I join you, sir?" a voice said from his back.  
“先生，我可以加入您吗？”一个声音从他背后传来。

Keel turned around to see Colonel Quaritch, wearing a black parka over his BDU blouse and fatigue pants; the utility belt held his personal sidearm in its holster, a parkerized Colt 1911.  
基尔转过身，看到夸里奇上校，他穿着黑色派克大衣，内搭 BDU 衬衫和迷彩裤；多功能腰带上挂着他的个人配枪，一把涂有防锈涂层的柯尔特 1911。

"Sure, you're welcome, Colonel," Keel said, smiling. "What brings you here?"  
“当然，上校，不客气，”基尔微笑着说，“是什么风把你吹来了？”

"Just to have some fresh air," the military man reasoned.  
“只是想呼吸点新鲜空气，”这位军人解释道。

"Ah."

Quaritch walked over to stand beside his boss. "Seems that you're quite pleased, sir."  
夸利奇走过去站在他的上司旁边。“看来您相当满意，先生。”

"And why I should be disappointed? What we're seeing out there is money well-spent."  
“我为什么要失望？我们看到的这些可是物有所值。”

"I count only nine of them, so where's the other three?" the officer asked, noting that only the white MP Evas and their carriers were present out in the open.  
“我只数到九个，那另外三个呢？”军官问道，注意到外面只有白色的 MP 初号机和它们的运输机。

Keel pointed his finger towards the trio of huge hangars a mile away from where they were standing. "They're still being retrofitted with extra weapons and armor."  
基尔指向一英里外他们所站位置的那三个巨大的机库。“它们仍在加装额外的武器和装甲进行改装。”

Quaritch nodded. "I see."  
夸里奇点点头。“我明白了。”

"That's right, Colonel, those three will come out should in case they feel lucky. You see, in a science-fiction movie that I watched not long ago... ah, I forgot the title, I think one of the characters once said this: 'why build one when you can have two at twice the price?' It's a brilliant decision on his part. Therefore it is necessary for us to have backup, to cover unusual contingencies that we may have not foreseen while planning, and to catch them off-guard. This is our strategy: a multi-pronged strike on all levels and all types of enemies."  
“没错，上校，那三座机库会在他们觉得自己运气好的时候出击。你知道吗，我不久前看过一部科幻电影……啊，忘了片名，我想其中一个角色曾说过这样的话：‘既然能花双倍价钱造两个，何必只造一个呢？’这是他明智的决定。因此我们有必要准备后备力量，以应对计划时可能未预见到的非常规情况，并打他们个措手不及。这就是我们的策略：全方位、多层次地对所有类型的敌人发起多线攻击。”

Keel then turned to face Quaritch, and from the old man's pocket he gave the military officer a Cuban Cohiba cigar in its aluminum tube. Gratefully Quaritch took it, brought out his Zippo lighter and a cutter, and began the mechanics of lighting up the precious stogie.  
基尔随后转向夸里奇，从老人口袋里掏出一支装在铝管中的古巴高希霸雪茄递给这位军官。夸里奇感激地接过，掏出他的芝宝打火机和雪茄剪，开始点燃这支珍贵的雪茄。

"Thank you, sir," Quaritch approved before puffing away.  
"谢谢您，长官，"夸里奇满意地说着，随即开始享受起来。

"Well," Keel said, watching the military man enjoying himself, in spite of his cancer. "Whether they're ready or not, after twenty-four hours we will be coming on their doorstep, and there will be no hesitation this time."  
"好吧，"基尔说道，看着这位军人尽管身患癌症仍自得其乐。"不管他们是否准备好了，二十四小时后我们将直捣黄龙，这次绝不会有任何犹豫。"

---

Unaware of Keel's preparations being conducted thousands of kilometers away, the _Jietai_ depots pre-positioned around Hakone were also engaged in full activity as they built up their forces.  
对基尔在数千公里外进行的准备毫不知情，围绕箱根预置的杰泰基地也在全力运作，加紧集结兵力。

Acting on direct orders from the Prime Minister, the soldiers, airmen and sailors were stockpiling munitions for their armored divisions, missiles for the destroyers, bombs for the fighters, and of course, bullets and grenades for infantry.  
根据首相的直接命令，士兵、飞行员和海军们正在为他们的装甲师储备弹药，为驱逐舰准备导弹，为战斗机准备炸弹，当然还有步兵所需的子弹和手榴弹。

At the same time their reconnaissance satellites in Earth orbit had all sensors trained upon the center of what was once Tokyo-3, gathering as much data – electronic, infrared, thermal, visible, synthetic aperture radar – and then transmitting everything back to _Jietai_ HQ on the foothills in the outskirts of Tokyo-2.  
与此同时，他们在地球轨道上的侦察卫星将所有传感器对准了曾是东京-3 的中心区域，收集尽可能多的数据——电子、红外、热能、可见光、合成孔径雷达——然后将所有信息传回东京-2 郊外的杰泰总部山脚下。

Beneath the Ministry of Defense building, protected by three meters of thick ferroconcrete and entombed further in fifty meters of earth, the Tactical Operations Center of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces was alive on war footing, with uniformed staffers going back and forth, exchanging and processing information, receiving phone calls and faxes, issuing orders, producing printouts, and constantly updating the map of Hakone and the order of battle on the huge main display.  
在防卫省大楼之下，被三米厚的钢筋混凝土和五十米深的泥土双重保护着的日本自卫队战术作战中心，正处于战备状态，身着制服的工作人员来回穿梭，交换和处理信息，接听电话和传真，下达命令，打印文件，并不停地更新箱根地区的地图和主显示屏上的战斗序列。

Right above the buzz of activity, in a closed conference room overseeing the TOC, the entire cabinet was deep in their emergency meeting, plus two generals, an admiral, and the Prime Minister himself, all engaged in a conversation about what to do with NERV and the perils they posed to the country.  
在繁忙的喧嚣之上，一个封闭的会议室内俯瞰着战术作战中心，整个内阁正在进行紧急会议，包括两位将军、一位海军上将以及首相本人，他们都在讨论如何应对 NERV 及其对国家构成的威胁。

"The Instrumentality Project that NERV was secretly researching for years has come almost close to completion," the Prime Minister said. "They're about to begin Third Impact to annihilate mankind, and the mere thought of it sends shivers down my spine."  
首相说道：“NERV 多年来秘密研究的‘人类补完计划’已接近完成。他们即将启动第三次冲击以灭绝人类，光是想到这一点就让我不寒而栗。”

He made the assertion after reading the last piece of intelligence that was presented to him by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, all the details obtained by the only spy who worked within NERV but now dead. For years he did not like this secretive agency and its questionable activities within his country, fearing whatever it was producing within its bowels could trigger a calamity on a global scale, but now, having heard of the near-disaster in the Geofront an hour ago, his fears were well-founded.  
他在阅读了内务部呈递给他的最后一份情报后，做出了这一断言。这份情报详细记录了唯一一位潜伏在 NERV 内部、现已身亡的间谍所获取的所有信息。多年来，他一直不喜欢这个神秘的机构及其在国内可疑的活动，担心其在内部制造的东西可能会在全球范围内引发灾难，但现在，在得知一小时前在地下空间发生的近灾难事件后，他的担忧得到了证实。

"Which is why, your Excellency, we're gearing up for the possibility of Commander Ikari betraying us," the _Jietai_ general in a green uniform said. "The staging areas are being readied as we speak, and our availability numbers for all of our divisions and squadrons are excellent, with up to 97 percent."  
“这就是为什么，阁下，我们正在为碇司令可能背叛我们的可能性做准备，”一位身着绿色制服的自卫队将军说道。“集结区域正在准备中，我们所有师团和中队的可用率都非常高，达到了 97%。”

The Prime Minister nodded. "Superb. Go on," he said.  
首相点头道：“很好。继续。”他说。

"For their safety, we are going to issue evacuation orders for people living within the 80 kilometer radius of our theater of operations," the general added. "We intend that there should be no civilian casualties by the time the operation commences."  
"为了他们的安全，我们将对居住在我们作战区域 80 公里半径内的居民发布疏散命令，"将军补充道。"我们打算在行动开始时确保没有平民伤亡。"

"And of course, we'll want to have limited or no media coverage should we proceed," the politician said. "What about our N2 missiles?"  
"当然，如果我们继续进行，我们希望媒体覆盖有限或没有报道，"政治家说。"我们的 N2 导弹怎么样？"

"The Tateyama launch facility now has N2 warheads loaded onto the ICBMs since yesterday, and is right now standing by, awaiting your orders," said the air force general, dressed in a dark blue uniform.  
"自昨天起，多贺山发射设施已经将 N2 弹头装载到洲际弹道导弹上，并且现在正在待命，等待您的命令，"空军将军穿着深蓝色制服说道。"

The launch site on the peninsula near what used to be old Tokyo, was originally used for the country's space program under the agency called JAXA; in the past, the agency's rockets were lifted off from that site, sending satellites into orbit, but now with the facility under strict military control, it saw recent combat action in which a weapon of mass destruction was used in anger for the first time in decades since _Fat__Man_ leveled Nagasaki: an N2-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile bathed the Third Angel with temperature hotter than the surface of the sun, but without much success as that Angel walked out of the firestorm minutes later with not much of a scratch.  
位于曾经是旧东京附近的半岛上的发射场，最初是用于国家空间计划，隶属于 JAXA 机构；过去，该机构的火箭从那里升空，将卫星送入轨道，但现在随着设施处于严格的军事控制之下，它最近参与了战斗行动，其中一种大规模杀伤性武器在愤怒中首次被使用，这是自 Fat__Man 夷平长崎以来的几十年中的第一次：一枚装有 N2 弹头的洲际弹道导弹，其温度比太阳表面还要高，但效果甚微，因为那个使徒在几分钟后从火风暴中走出，几乎没有受到什么伤害。

But this time they would soon be using the weapon on a _real_ target, one that can be easily destroyed.  
但这一次，他们很快就会将这种武器用于真正的目标，一个可以轻易摧毁的目标。

"With the detonation delay mechanism," the general said, "the warhead should be sufficiently powerful enough to penetrate through a hundred meters of earth and then rip out the Geofront's shell, just right to make a hole two kilometers wide. The blast would also generate a sizable amount of devastating shrapnel and a strong shockwave to kill any exposed personnel within the dome."  
“利用爆炸延迟机制，”将军说道，“弹头应该足够强大，能够穿透一百米的地面，然后撕裂出地下城的壳体，正好可以制造一个两公里宽的洞。爆炸还会产生大量破坏性弹片和强大的冲击波，杀死穹顶内任何暴露的人员。”

"What else?" "还有什么？"

"Since our guided missile destroyers were built along their original American counterparts, sharing design characteristics," the admiral in white uniform said. "We will load them with conventionally-tipped Tomahawks in the VLS launchers, and after the N2 destroys the outer shell, they are programmed to hit the HQ building, plus any vital installations they have as secondary targets."  
"既然我们的导弹驱逐舰是按照美国原型舰建造的，具有相同的设计特点，"" 穿着白色制服的海军上将说道，""我们将在垂直发射系统中装载常规弹头的战斧导弹，在 N2 摧毁外壳后，它们将被编程以攻击总部大楼，以及任何作为次要目标的重要设施。"

"Only then, along with full artillery and rocket strikes, and saturation bombing to soften enemy positions, we will throw everything we have into that snake pit," the GSDF general said. "We will use our Chinook choppers to land in the troops and equipment, gunships to provide air support, and bulk lifters will follow them up by dropping in armor with their tanks and APCs right there," the army general added.  
"只有在全面炮击和火箭攻击，以及饱和轰炸削弱敌方阵地之后，我们才会将所有力量投入那个蛇窝，"" 陆上自卫队将军说道，""我们将使用支奴干直升机运送部队和装备，武装直升机提供空中支援，而大型运输机将紧随其后，用坦克和装甲车直接空投装甲部队，"" 陆军将军补充道。"

The Zeppelin bulk lifters were recently included to the AJSDF inventory; manufactured by a new German aerospace company using the same name as its original creator, they were essentially double-bodied dirigibles thrice the size of the ill-fated _Hindenburg,_ built out of advanced aerospace materials, filled with helium, and used very powerful engines to move as much tonnage as a C-5 Galaxy military cargo plane with the accuracy of a heavy-lift helicopter. Furthermore these bulk lifters were designed and then tested to withstand even typhoon-intensity winds while in the air.  
齐柏林大型起重机最近被纳入日本自卫队装备；由一家新成立的德国航空航天公司制造，该公司沿用了其原始创造者的名称，这些起重机本质上是一种双体飞艇，体积是灾难性的兴登堡号的三倍，采用先进的航空材料制造，填充氦气，并使用非常强大的发动机，能够以重型运输直升机的精确度移动相当于 C-5 银河军用运输机的吨位。此外，这些大型起重机在设计时经过测试，即使在台风强度的风中也能在空中保持稳定。

"Is anyone monitoring their communications?" The Prime Minister asked.  
“有人在监控他们的通讯吗？”首相问道。

"Yes, and even up to now," the minister of telecommunications said. "With NERV's lines tapped and being listened to, we're passing all the data to Internal Affairs, to keep us one step ahead."  
“是的，甚至直到现在，”电信部长说，“我们已经监听了 NERV 的线路并进行监听，所有数据都传递给了内务部，以确保我们始终领先一步。”

"But before we commit all that," the general said, "do we have to negotiate with them first?"  
"但在我们全面投入之前，"将军说道，"我们是不是得先和他们谈判一下？"

"Yes, and what we should say once the world finds out what's going on?" the foreign minister chimed in.  
"是的，一旦世界得知真相，我们该如何回应？"外交部长插话道。"

The Prime Minister thought for a moment. He'd been thinking about this scheme – the largest heavy assault ever soon to be conducted by the Japanese military since Pearl Harbor – for two weeks, about the implications this scheme might bring to him and the rest of the world.  
首相沉思片刻。他已对这个计划——自珍珠港事件以来日本军方即将实施的最大规模重型攻击——思考了两周，考虑这一计划可能给他和世界其他地区带来的影响。

In any case, it was Ikari and his little project that worried him much, after he read the intelligence summary and reports, all of the evidence indelibly linking that man to the Antarctica incident. He remembered the last few times he talked with this enigmatic Ikari, sometimes on the phone, and sometimes through streaming video.  
无论如何，让他深感忧虑的是碇源堂和他的那个小项目，在他阅读了情报摘要和报告后，所有证据都无可辩驳地将那个人与南极事件联系在一起。他记得最近几次与这位神秘的碇源堂交谈，有时是通过电话，有时则是通过视频直播。

The Prime Minister didn't have to be in the same room as Gendo to feel his cold spirit; even his voice exuded a disturbing coolness, as if he had no qualms with his job. Any lower than Ikari's double doctorate, the politician decided, he would've been a fastidious killer... or someone like Adolf Hitler.  
首相无需与碇源堂同处一室就能感受到他那冰冷的气息；就连他的声音也透着一股令人不安的冷酷，仿佛他对工作毫无顾虑。这位政治家认为，如果碇源堂的博士学位再低一些，他可能会成为一个一丝不苟的杀手……或者像阿道夫·希特勒那样的人。

And the last thing the world needed was a doomsday prophet, one who would destroy all mankind, and if he needed to preserve his legacy, he must have Ikari stopped… even if the PM was under Keel Lorenz's authority through means of wholesale bribery.  
而世界最不需要的就是一个末日预言家，一个会毁灭全人类的人，如果他需要保全自己的遗产，就必须阻止碇源堂……即便首相是通过基尔·洛伦兹的大规模贿赂而受其控制。

"Here is our ultimatum: twenty-four hours from now, presenting NERV with our demands, I want them to bring out Commander Ikari and his co-conspirators, have them arrested for treason, disclose their secrets, and then have that whole place shut down _completely_," the Prime Minister finally said. "That's what we'll ask from them first. But should they do not agree, or they attack preemptively with their Evas, or they begin powering up their doomsday project, whatever the hell it is… _Kill_ them all without hesitation, destroy everything inside, and then seal it up completely. Understand?"  
"这是我们的最后通牒：从现在起二十四小时内，向 NERV 提出我们的要求，我要他们交出碇司令及其同谋者，以叛国罪逮捕他们，公开他们的秘密，然后彻底关闭那个地方，"首相终于说道。"这是我们首先会向他们提出的要求。但如果他们不同意，或者他们用 EVA 先行攻击，或者他们开始启动那个末日计划，不管那是什么鬼东西……毫不犹豫地消灭他们，摧毁内部一切，然后彻底封锁。明白吗？"

The _Jietai_ generals nodded. "Yes, sir," they replied in unison.  
自卫队将领们点头。"是，长官，"他们齐声回答。

The Prime Minister stood up and added, "We will not allow America, Germany or China to interfere with this internal matter, nor allow them to take advantage of us. Furthermore, if the Diet starts asking questions afterwards, should we and our country ever survive in one piece, we'll present them with our own facts; considering the gravity of the situation we're facing, they'll believe in everything."  
首相站起身来补充道："我们不允许美国、德国或中国干涉这一内部事务，也不允许他们利用我们。此外，如果事后国会开始提出疑问，假使我们和国家还能完整存活下来，我们将向他们展示我们的事实；考虑到我们所面临的严峻形势，他们会相信一切。"

He then took a breath and picked up a red phone. "For this time being," he said while dialing, "with the emergency powers granted to me, and for the sake of preserving public order, this country shall be put in a state of martial law… and that will begin _now_."  
他随即深吸一口气，拿起了一部红色电话。“在此期间，”他一边拨号一边说道，“凭借授予我的紧急权力，为了维护公共秩序，本国将进入戒严状态……这一措施即刻生效。”

---

His secretary, a slender thirty-year old woman, was silently observing them as she stood behind her boss, talking about making war on NERV and then martial law, before he made a call.  
他的秘书，一位三十岁左右的苗条女性，正默默地站在老板身后观察着他们，谈论着对 NERV 宣战以及随后宣布戒严的事宜，然后他拨通了一个电话。

She then silently remarked to herself: _Humans_ _must_ _be_ _the_ _only_ _creatures_ _able_ _to_ _despise_ _their_ _own_ _kind._  
她随后默默地在心中感慨：人类必定是唯一一种能够鄙视同类的生物。

As she presented a folder to her boss, containing a document confirming his order to impose martial law, called _Operation_ _Plan_ _Sagittarius_ _(Executive_ _Order_ _A801)_, the woman then wondered where she would be when the shooting time comes, and what about her family?  
当她向老板递交一份文件夹，内含确认他下达戒严令的文件，名为“射手座行动计划”（行政命令 A801），女子随即思索起枪声响起时自己将在何处，她的家人又该如何？

As he signed the executive order, both in paper and digital forms, making it effective from now on to suspend civil liberties and hand over civilian government control to the military in all levels, the secretary closed her eyes for a moment, and prayed that at this moment they should be far away from Hakone.  
当他签署了这份行政命令，无论是纸质还是电子形式，使其即刻生效，暂停公民自由并将各级平民政府控制权移交给军队，秘书闭上眼睛片刻，祈祷此时他们已远离箱根。

_In his dream, his sleep induced by the anesthesia administered to him during the operation, Kaworu was standing amongst a sea of crimson-soaked cadavers.  
在他的梦中，手术中麻醉带来的沉睡里，渚薰站立于一片被鲜血浸透的尸体之海中。_

_His white sneakers were now drenched in blood, as he walked over the bodies, mostly dressed in NERV uniforms, all of them unarmed, their faces contorted in pain and disbelief, their sightless glassy eyes having witnessed the final moments of their lives before being cut down by bullets. The rest of his surroundings were burning, with buildings reduced to rubble, some of them pock-marked with the impacts of munitions.  
他的白色运动鞋此刻已被鲜血浸透，他踏过一具具尸体，这些尸体大多身着 NERV 制服，手无寸铁，面容因痛苦和难以置信而扭曲，无神的玻璃眼珠见证了他们生命终结前的最后一刻，被子弹无情击倒。四周余烬未熄，建筑化为废墟，有些布满弹痕，遭受了炮火的摧残。_

_He then looked up to the sky, the Geofront opened up completely, and saw nine white Evas, descending from above, their elastic wings unfurled in flight.  
他随即抬头望向天空，地底都市完全敞开，只见九架白色 EVA 从天而降，弹性翼展在空中展开，翱翔而下。_

_They encircled Unit One just as she came out of the Pyramid's ruins, and then a spear, as though hurled by an unseen God, flew in very fast and stopped short of striking that Eva's throat with its twin tines.  
它们环绕着一号机，就在她从金字塔废墟中现身之际，一柄长矛仿佛被无形之神投掷，疾速飞来，却在触及 EVA 喉咙的双叉前戛然而止。_

_He could then hear Shinji screaming, having lost all control of Unit One, the white Evas instantly imprisoning both pilot and Eva in their glowing AT-Fields.  
他随即听到真嗣的尖叫声，初号机已完全失控，白色 EVA 们瞬间用它们闪耀的 AT 力场将驾驶员和 EVA 一同囚禁。_

_As if he sensed his presence, Kaworu then turned to find Keel standing several meters away from him, the old man's face glowing in triumph. Keel also had a small pistol in his hand, its barrel still smoking, before Kaworu slowly lowered his gaze to find Gendo Ikari's lifeless body lying right at the old man's feet.  
仿佛感应到了他的存在，渚薰转过身来，发现基尔正站在几米之外，老者的脸上闪烁着胜利的光芒。基尔手中还握着一把小型手枪，枪管仍在冒烟，渚薰缓缓垂下目光，看到源堂·碇的尸体正躺在老者的脚边，毫无生气。_

_Suddenly Keel laughed, the loudest Kaworu could ever hear from him, and then as though he was very close, the old man spoke.  
突然，基尔放声大笑，这是渚薰听过的最响亮的笑声，随后，仿佛近在咫尺，老者开口了。_

"_Do you think you and these dead blasphemers can win?" Keel questioned, staring back at Kaworu through his visor. "If he said that death gives birth to nothing, then death is what they shall have. You will have no hope but defeat, only we hope for victory over your worthless friends. They shall be subsumed into Instrumentality, whether they want it or not."_  
"你以为你和这些死去的亵渎者能赢吗？" 基尔问道，透过面罩回视着渚薰。"如果他说死亡孕育不了任何东西，那么他们将迎来死亡。你除了失败别无希望，只有我们渴望战胜你那些无价值的朋友。他们将被纳入人类补完计划，无论他们是否愿意。"

_Keel then outstretched his right hand, the pistol still in his grip, to point out Unit One being lifted out into the sky, accompanied with the grinning white Evas, brandishing their imitations of the original Spear.  
基尔随后伸出右手，手枪仍紧握在手中，指向初号机被吊起到空中，伴随着那些咧嘴笑的白色 EVA，挥舞着它们对原初之矛的仿制品。_

"_She shall have purpose in this end," Keel said. "She, being the true clone of Lilith, will be the key for our final salvation."_  
"她将在这终结中找到自己的意义，" 基尔说。"作为莉莉丝的真·克隆体，她将成为我们最终救赎的关键。"

---

Suddenly Kaworu woke up with a start, his eyes flicking open to find the white glare of the morning sun almost blinding him as it shone through the windows. He blinked, and turned his head to find Rei staring back at him with her alert, cerise eyes.  
突然，渚薰猛地醒来，双眼睁开，迎面而来的是早晨阳光的刺眼白光，透过窗户照得他几乎睁不开眼。他眨了眨眼，转头发现丽正用她那警觉的深红色眼睛回望着他。

Kaworu sighed in relief. "Oh, it's you… Sorry."  
渚薰松了口气，叹道："哦，是你啊……抱歉。"

"Good morning," Rei said. "What is wrong?"  
"早上好，" 丽说，"怎么了？"

The Fifth Children swiveled a bit to check on his left arm; it was whole once again, the site of the amputation now heavily wrapped in bandages. He could also hear the faint beeping of the ECG monitor, its sensors taped to his chest. Almost above his head was the usual plastic bottle of dextrose, slowly providing his bloodstream a little sugar.  
第五个孩子稍微转动了一下身体，检查他的左臂；它又一次完好无损，截肢处现在被厚厚的绷带紧紧包裹。他还能听到心电监护仪微弱的哔哔声，传感器贴在他的胸前。几乎在他头顶上方，是通常的葡萄糖塑料瓶，缓慢地为他的血液提供一点糖分。

"No… Nothing, I'm just fine," he said.  
“不……没什么，我很好，”他说。

"You woke up as if you came from a dream," Rei said.  
“你醒来时仿佛刚从一个梦中走出，”丽说。

The young man's now looked serious. "Yes, but it's a nightmare."  
年轻人的神情此刻变得严肃。“是的，但那是个噩梦。”

He then recounted to Rei about the nightmare he had, in every detail, down to the very wisp of smoke coming out of the barrel of Keel's weapon.  
他随后向丽详细讲述了他所做的噩梦，每一个细节，甚至包括基尔武器枪口冒出的那一缕烟。

"He will leave this place nothing but a barren wilderness, should he wins," Kaworu concluded, and without warning he tried to get up.  
“如果他赢了，这里将只剩下一片荒芜。”渚薰总结道，未作任何预告便试图起身。

Alarmed, Rei took his wrist. "You cannot leave yet," she warned. "Doctor Akagi told me."  
惊慌中，丽抓住了他的手腕。“你还不能走，”她警告道，“赤木博士告诉过我。”

"What?" "什么？"

Rei shook her head. "You need to rest first."  
丽摇了摇头。“你需要先休息。”

"But this is urgent, and I need to talk to Misato. Where's she?"  
“但这件事很紧急，我需要和美里谈谈。她在哪儿？”

As if by the mere mention of her name, Misato and Ritsuko entered the room, and they saw Kaworu sitting on the bed.  
仿佛仅仅提到她的名字，美里和律子便走进了房间，看到渚薰正坐在床上。

"So you're now up… and what the heck are you supposed to do off the bed?" Misato demanded.  
“所以你现在醒了……那你到底打算在床上干些什么？”美里质问道。

"I want to talk to you," Kaworu replied. "I'm trying to get up, but I'm sorry I woke up pretty hard."  
“我想和你谈谈，”渚薰回答，“我正努力起床，但很抱歉我醒得相当困难。”

"No big deal," the woman officer said as she found an extra chair and sat down on it. "Tell me, what's wrong?"  
"没什么大不了的," 女警官说着找到一把多余的椅子坐了下来。"告诉我，出什么事了？"

"He had a dream," Rei said. "He dreamed that they attacked us."  
"他做了一个梦," 丽说。"他梦见他们攻击了我们。"

"Who, SEELE?" "谁，SEELE？"

Kaworu nodded. "That's correct. They could make the first strike at any moment, and I fear that we could suffer too much," he said, before retelling them a shortened version of his experience.  
渚薰点头道：“没错。他们随时可能发动第一次攻击，我担心我们可能会遭受重创。”随后，他向他们简述了自己的经历。

"Which is why, in a few minutes," Misato said afterwards, "Ritsuko and I are going to attend an emergency meeting."  
“这就是为什么，几分钟后，”美里接着说，“我和律子要去参加一个紧急会议。”

"Okay." “好的。”

Without hesitation Ritsuko took out her stethoscope and for a moment, with Misato and Rei observing, went about giving Kaworu a impromptu physical examination.  
律子毫不犹豫地拿出听诊器，在美里和绫波零的注视下，临时给渚薰做了一次身体检查。

Afterwards, Ritsuko turned to Misato and said, "On second thought… I'd say he's ready."  
随后，律子转向美里说道：“再考虑一下…我觉得他已经准备好了。”

The other woman was surprised. "What? I thought you want him to rest?"  
另一位女性感到惊讶。“什么？我以为你想让他休息？”

"Because we're in a really critical situation, I've changed my mind," the blonde doctor replied, and then she turned to Kaworu. "I want you to join us in that meeting, which would start within thirty minutes."  
“因为现在情况非常紧急，我改变了主意，”金发医生回答，然后转向薰。“我希望你参加半小时后开始的会议。”

"Okay," Kaworu agreed. "I think you really want my input."  
“好吧，”渚薰同意道，“我想你真的很需要我的意见。”

"That's right," Misato said. "You have first-hand, class-A intel, direct from the source, and as such I want you and Rei to help me with the planning of our defense, because for this time we don't wish to be caught with our pants down."  
“没错，”美里说，“你拥有一手、顶级的情报，直接来自源头，因此我希望你和绫波协助我制定防御计划，因为我们这次不想再措手不及。”

"I will come," Rei said.  
“我会来，”绫波说。

Kaworu smiled. "Thank you," he said before Ritsuko went to the intercom to ask for the nurse to assist in freeing the Fifth Children from the IV tube and the ECG electrodes.  
渚薰微笑着说：“谢谢。”随后，律子走向对讲机，请求护士来协助将第五适格者从输液管和心电图电极中解脱出来。

Misato then faced Rei and, pointing at a duffel bag containing his clothes, she ordered, "Go get his clothes… and oh, by the way, Kaworu—"  
美里随后面对绫波，指着装有他衣物的旅行袋，命令道：“去拿他的衣服……哦，对了，渚薰——”

They all heard the young man's stomach growling, cutting Misato off.  
他们都听到了年轻人的肚子咕咕叫，打断了美里的话。

"Pardon me, but yes?" Kaworu responded, but he looked a little embarrassed.  
“请原谅，是的？” 渚薰回答道，但他的脸上略显尴尬。

Misato laughed and then she said, "I'm sure there will be some breakfast served, so no problem if you feel hungry, okay?"  
美里笑了笑，然后说道：“我相信会有早餐供应的，所以如果你饿了也没关系，好吗？”

As Rei placed his clothes on his blanket-covered legs, Kaworu nodded. "Once again, thanks."  
当绫波零将他的衣服放在他盖着毯子的腿上时，渚薰点了点头。“再次感谢。”

"You're welcome," Misato said. "Now get dressed, 'cause we don't want to get late."  
"不客气，"美里说。"现在快穿上衣服，我们可不想迟到。"

---

Now Kaworu was in the bathroom, the shower head at full blast as the room slowly filled up with steam. Before stepping into the stall, he paused for a moment to check on his left forearm, intact once again, with not even a scar left.  
现在，渚薰在浴室里，淋浴头开到最大，房间慢慢充满了蒸汽。在进入淋浴间之前，他停顿了一下，检查了一下他的左前臂，再次完好无损，连一道疤痕都没有留下。

He then remembered the final moment he was within the huge grip of Unit-01, her fingers almost crushing him, making breathing and movement difficult.  
他随后想起了自己在初号机巨大抓握中的最后一刻，她的手指几乎要将他压碎，使得呼吸和移动都变得困难。

But even at that point, and while giving Shinji his spiel, his mind was already at work until he figured out a way to escape.  
但即便在那时，当他对真嗣滔滔不绝时，他的心思已经在飞速运转，直到他想出了一个逃脱的办法。

And he remembered Leriel, one of his brethren, capable of producing an unusual form in which his real body was a powerful multidimensional black hole, a Sea of Dirac, and his "shadow" a zebra-striped sphere.  
他记得莱利尔，他的一个同类，能够产生一种奇特的形态，其中他的真实身体是一个强大的多维黑洞，即狄拉克海，而他的“影子”则是一个斑马条纹的球体。

Before being sent to Tokyo-3 and as part of his training, which included the review and study of every piece of footage, raw and uncut, of the Evas in action, Kaworu witnessed how Leriel conceived of that strange property, as he took Unit-01 unawares, expecting the sphere to be her target, only to make a misstep into the blackness spreading under her feet, before sinking in like a mastodon trapped in a tar pit. Then hours later, in what could be construed as a ghastly depiction of a magic trick gone awry, Unit-01 emerged from the sphere, tearing Leriel's fleshy "shadow" apart as she burst out with an unearthly roar.  
在被派往东京-3 之前，作为他训练的一部分，包括回顾和研究每一段未经剪辑的 Eva 行动录像，渚薰目睹了莱利尔是如何构想出那种奇特性质的，他趁初号机不备，以为球体是她的目标，却误入了她脚下蔓延的黑暗，然后像被困在焦油坑中的乳齿象一样沉没。几个小时后，初号机从球体中出现，撕裂了莱利尔那肉质的“影子”，伴随着一声非人间的咆哮冲了出来，这情景简直像是糟糕的魔术表演出了岔子。

That became his Houdini trick, and in a fraction of a second Kaworu concentrated all of his energy to open up a portal, tens of meters directly below him, just beneath the orange surface of LCL.  
那成了他的胡迪尼魔术，刹那间，碇真嗣集中所有能量在他脚下数十米处打开了一个传送门，正好位于橙色的 LCL 表面之下。

Once done, he then unleashed a blinding glow emanating from his body, to distract everyone, and willed himself to change into a _liquid__state_, to drip out of the death grip and land directly into that Sea of Dirac, thus he disappeared from out of physical existence, to a different world beyond the reckoning of existing physics and scientific explanation, where time and space became immaterial.  
完成后，他随即从体内释放出耀眼的光芒，以分散所有人的注意力，并使自己变成液态，从死亡的束缚中滴落，直接落入狄拉克海，从而从物质存在中消失，进入了一个超越现有物理学和科学解释的另一个世界，在那里时间和空间变得无关紧要。

When Kaworu opened his eyes in this elseworld, the verses of William Blake flashed through his mind:  
当碇真嗣在这个异世界睁开眼睛时，威廉·布莱克的诗句闪过他的脑海：

_To see a world in a grain of sand,  
从一粒沙看世界，  
And a heaven in a wild flower,  
从一朵花窥天堂，  
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,  
将无限握在掌心，  
And eternity in an hour.  
刹那即永恒。_

He then saw ghostly figures at first coming out of the darkness, almost unrecognizable due to their glowing forms, but as it came closer the apparitions became well-defined until fourteen of them stood before him, dressed in white, flowing robes, all formed in the image of the Lilin.  
他首先看到幽灵般的身影从黑暗中浮现，由于散发着光芒，几乎难以辨认，但随着它们逐渐靠近，这些幽灵变得清晰起来，直到十四位身着白色飘逸长袍、形似莉莉丝的存在站在他面前。

They were the Angels who previously failed to wrestle destiny from the hands of Lilin, and having defeated by the Evas, they were banished to this elseworld, where they were to wait in limbo until some far-off time be summoned to relive in a different existence.  
它们是之前未能从莉莉丝手中夺取命运的天使，被 EVA 击败后，被流放到这个异界，在这里等待着，直到遥远的未来被召唤，在不同的存在中重获新生。

The tallest of the Angels approached Kaworu, staring into his cerise eyes, with intent to question his unexplained appearance in this realm.  
天使中最高大的那位走向渚薰，凝视着他那双深红色的眼眸，意图质询他在这个领域中突如其来的出现。

"_Brother, what has brought you here?" he asked. "Have you died now, as predicted?"_  
“兄弟，是什么将你带到了这里？”他问道，“你已经如预言般逝去了吗？”

"_It's not my time," Kaworu replied. "I'm sorry… I have to do this for a friend."_  
“还不是我的时刻，”渚薰回答，“对不起……我必须为了一个朋友这么做。”

"_Is it the one Child who defeated us before you?"_  
"是你之前打败我们的那个孩子吗？"

_Kaworu nodded. "Right, but this is a very different situation," he said. "You see, there's a difference between the time before I came to his presence, and afterwards. Before, I was made as a servant, created from his body and of our first Brethren; I was ordered to subjugate, to emasculate this Child, sow doubt and fear in his soul.  
"渚薰点头。“没错，但这次情况截然不同，”他说。“你看，在我来到他面前之前和之后，时间是有区别的。之前，我是作为仆人被创造出来的，从他的身体和我们的第一位兄弟中诞生；我被命令去征服，去削弱这个孩子，在他的灵魂中播下怀疑和恐惧的种子。”_

"_But after I have met the child of Lilith, I have thought otherwise; I suddenly had a change of heart."_  
"但在我遇见莉莉丝的孩子之后，我的想法改变了；我突然心意转变。"

"_Why then?"_ “为什么这么说？”

"_After even a short time," Kaworu answered, "I have finally understood why humanity, or beings we call as Lilin, have a reason to exist instead of us: it's hope that impels them to do what it takes to make their world livable even if some of them are engaged in strife."_  
“即使是短暂的时间之后，”渚薰回答，“我终于明白了为什么人类，或者说我们称之为莉莉丝的存在，有理由存在而不是我们：是希望驱使他们尽一切努力让他们的世界变得宜居，即使其中一些人卷入了冲突。”

"_Yet they are supposed to be destroyed in the first place, for the world they exist in is not theirs to take," the tall Angel argued. "They have doomed themselves, and we are ready to take back what should be ours... and you are supposed to be our final hope!"_  
“然而他们本应被毁灭，因为他们所存在的世界并不属于他们，”高大的天使反驳道。“他们已经自取灭亡，而我们准备收回本应属于我们的东西……而你本应是我们的最后希望！”

"_Think again," Kaworu said. "Have you ever felt their suffering hearts, as they fought against you? Have you understood their deepest desires and fears? Not all of them are deserving of condemnation, and this includes the Children; they do not warrant this for they have grievously lost what makes them whole; they took up fighting us, thinking it would give them purpose, a reason to exist, under the noble pretense that they're bred to save their world... But no, they were being manipulated without realizing it, merely tools for other scheming men seeking to harvest the fruit that is not yet ripe before its time."_  
"再想想，"渚薰说。"你可曾感受到他们战斗时内心的痛苦？你理解他们的最深渴望与恐惧吗？并非所有人都该受到谴责，包括那些孩子们；他们不应承受这一切，因为他们已经失去了完整自我的根本；他们拿起武器对抗我们，以为这会赋予他们存在的意义，以拯救世界的崇高名义...但事实并非如此，他们未曾意识到自己正被操纵，只是其他阴谋家手中未成熟便急于收割的工具罢了。"

_The Angel was ashen-faced. "What do you mean?"  
天使面色苍白。"你这是什么意思？"_

"_What is happening in the world of the Lilin," Kaworu said. "These men are seeking to force Instrumentality prematurely without realizing its true meaning, and they want nothing but escape from the morass they have created in their greed and avarice, to destroy and subsume all others in a single day, without quarter given or taken."_  
"在人类的世界里，"渚薰说。"这些人试图强行提前实现人类补完计划，却未领悟其真正含义，他们只想逃离因贪婪和欲望而陷入的泥潭，企图在一天之内毁灭并吞噬一切，不给予也不接受任何宽恕。"

_There were no words between them for a moment before the other Angel spoke again.  
他们之间沉默了片刻，随后另一位天使再次开口。_

"_So, you are willing to return to that world?"_  
“那么，你愿意回到那个世界吗？”

_Kaworu nodded. "Yes, it is now my duty to be involved, to save their existence from that impending doom."  
渚薰点头。“是的，现在我有责任介入，拯救他们免于那场即将到来的毁灭。”_

_The tall Angel shook his head. "You are a romantic fool, Tabris."  
高大的天使摇了摇头。“你是个浪漫的傻瓜，塔布里斯。”_

"_I have no problems calling me that," Kaworu responded defiantly. "It's my decision now, and should I and the Lilin survive, I am prepared to become a mortal for my beloved, to sacrifice my immortality and all the powers granted to me. Now, do you agree with what I am about to do?"_  
“我对此毫无异议，”渚薰倔强地回应，“这是我现在的决定，如果我和人类能幸存下来，我已准备好为了我的爱人成为一个凡人，牺牲我的不朽和所有赋予我的力量。现在，你同意我要做的事吗？”

_At first, the other Angels looked at each other with askance, unsure what to say, before they started to debate among themselves, like Greek academics in Plato's time. This took Kaworu some twenty-or-so-Lilin minutes until they finally reached a consensus, confronting with their eyes staring right at him.  
起初，其他天使们面面相觑，不知该说什么，随后他们开始像柏拉图时代的希腊学者那样争论起来。这花了渚薰大约二十分钟左右的人类时间，直到他们最终达成一致，目光直视着他。_

"_Tabris," the tall Angel said._  
"塔布里斯," 高大的天使说道。

_Kaworu blinked. "Yes?" 渚薰眨了眨眼。"是的？"_

"_You shall be our only ambassador; you shall be sent back into their world as a Bodhisattva, to save them all, and to teach the Lilin the error of their ways should you and your allies win the day. However… In case Instrumentality happens beyond your power to stop it, then we all know who are deserving of redemption, those who are fools shall be condemned to be reborn without any knowledge of evil or malice, to be reeducated... and those who are evil incarnate, there shall be no reward for them."_  
"你将成为我们唯一的使者；你将被送回他们的世界，作为菩萨，拯救他们所有人，并在你和你的盟友胜利之日教导人类他们的错误。然而…如果在你力所不能及的情况下发生人类补完计划，那么我们都知道谁值得救赎，那些愚蠢的人将被判重生，没有任何邪恶或恶意的知识，接受再教育...而那些邪恶化身的人，他们将不会有任何回报。"

"_So you mean…" Kaworu trailed._  
"所以你的意思是…" 渚薰话音渐弱。

"_For them, there can be only one final chance. No more, no less, no second chances, and no reversal."_  
"对他们来说，只有一次最终的机会。不多不少，没有第二次机会，也没有逆转的可能。"

_Kaworu nodded._ "_I agree, Bardiel."_  
渚薰点头。"我同意，巴迪尔。"

"_Go forth, Brother," Bardiel said. "They are waiting for you… and yes, we will remember your sacrifice for eternity... Shalom."_  
"去吧，兄弟，" 巴迪尔说。"他们在等你……是的，我们将永远记住你的牺牲……沙洛姆。"

_Without a word, Kaworu smiled and then bowed in thanks, before he slowly faded out.  
没有言语，渚薰微笑着鞠躬致谢，随后缓缓消失。_

---

His eyes flying open once more, Kaworu found himself back to reality, with the steamy water now splashing on the top of his head, making his tufts of gray hair completely and dripping wet.  
他的眼睛再次睁开，渚薰发现自己回到了现实，蒸汽腾腾的水花溅在他的头顶，使得他那一头灰发彻底湿透，滴着水珠。

With Rei and the others waiting for him, he decided not to hesitate any further, so Kaworu took the bar of soap from the tray set into the tiled wall, and began to lather himself.  
看着丽和其他人在等他，他决定不再犹豫，于是薰从嵌在瓷砖墙上的托盘中拿起一块肥皂，开始给自己打泡沫。

---

At that same moment, as the sun slowly rose from the depths of the Pacific Ocean, the same sun that the Japanese respected for thousands of years, the very life-giving and warm symbol of Amaterasu, the _Jietai_ units have begun to move in quietly to enforce martial law, from rural hamlets to major cities within a 80-kilometer radius of Hakone.  
就在同一时刻，太阳缓缓从太平洋深处升起，这个太阳是日本人民数千年来所尊崇的，是生命之源、温暖之象征的天照大神，自卫队单位已经开始悄悄行动，从偏远乡村到距离箱根 80 公里范围内的主要城市，实施戒严。

Operation Sagittarius was now underway.  
射手座行动现已展开。

Disrupting the breakfasts of countless civilians thinking about the day ahead as they ate, scores of helicopters and planes roared over rooftops, along with tanks and APCs rumbling through the streets, all of the martial activity almost a modern-day reenactment of the American invasion more than half a century ago.  
无数平民在享用早餐、思考即将到来的一天时，成群的直升机和飞机轰鸣着掠过屋顶，坦克和装甲车在街道上隆隆驶过，这一切军事行动宛如半个多世纪前美国入侵的现代重演。

The _Jietai_ officers came up to the doorsteps of every town and city hall in that radius, presenting the faxed copy of their orders from the Prime Minister himself, and some of the mayors complied without question.  
戒备军官们来到该区域内每个城镇和市政厅的门口，递交了首相亲笔签署的传真命令副本，其中一些市长毫不犹豫地遵从了。

Some, however, asked why, and the soldiers replied that they were merely following orders to enforce public safety and to forestall any possibility of chaos arising from an impending disaster.  
然而，有些人询问原因，士兵们回答说，他们只是在执行确保公共安全、防止即将到来的灾难引发混乱的命令。

What disaster? the local officials asked in doubt.  
什么灾难？当地官员疑惑地问道。

The military officers brought out another lengthy document, purportedly a report produced by government scientists, who said that they feared that at any moment the NERV installation within Hakone may face a catastrophic disaster resulting from a flawed experiment, including the possibility of a powerful mass explosion, with biological or radioactive contamination.  
军官们拿出另一份冗长的文件，据称是由政府科学家撰写的报告，他们担心箱根的 NERV 设施随时可能因一项有缺陷的实验而面临灾难性灾难，包括可能发生的强大大规模爆炸，以及生物或放射性污染。

Without much ado, and considering the amount of fear and chaos generated by the Evas whenever they were deep in combat with the Angels, thus making NERV highly unpopular outside Hakone, the local officials declared a state of emergency, exhorting citizens to evacuate and empty their homes, helped along with the _Jietai_ providing generous assistance to the near-panicked people to direct them to evacuation areas beyond the potential danger zone.  
无需多言，考虑到 EVA 在与使徒深入战斗时引发的恐惧和混乱，使得 NERV 在箱根以外的地方极不受欢迎，当地官员宣布进入紧急状态，敦促市民撤离并清空家园，同时自卫队慷慨协助那些近乎恐慌的人们，引导他们前往潜在危险区外的疏散区域。

Next thing after hearing the declaration from their officials, the locals, especially the younger generations, started posting messages on every social network (Twitter, Facebook, Mixi) or video streaming site (Nico Video or Youtube), or on their cellular phones (almost overloading NTT's exchanges and cell sites), telling about their current status, eyewitness news, and exchanges with alarmed relatives and friends.  
在听到官方声明后，当地人，尤其是年轻一代，开始在各大社交网络（如 Twitter、Facebook、Mixi）或视频流媒体网站（如 Nico Video 或 Youtube）上，以及通过手机（几乎使 NTT 的交换机和基站过载）发布消息，分享他们当前的状态、目击新闻以及与惊慌的亲友的交流。

Soon the highways and trains were filled with fleeing refugees, in all forms of transportation, from tiny _kei_ cars to tour buses and trailer trucks, hauling almost all of their personal possessions even on the roofs of their vehicles.  
很快，高速公路上和火车里挤满了逃难的难民，各种交通工具，从小型轻自动车到旅游大巴和拖车，车顶上甚至都堆满了他们的个人物品。

In thirty minutes the unusual activity around Hakone, with news filtering out of Japan got the world's attention, and the news channels went on air, shouting _Breaking_ _Story_ in digitized captions on screen, anchors in studios talking about the widespread evacuation with the correspondents in Tokyo and elsewhere.  
半小时内，箱根周边的异常活动以及日本传出的消息引起了全球关注，新闻频道纷纷直播，屏幕上滚动着“突发新闻”的数字化字幕，演播室的主持人谈论着广泛的疏散情况，东京和其他地方的记者也纷纷报道。

After an hour, with the evacuation order in effect, the Prime Minister appeared on television, to explain his reasons for declaring martial law.  
一小时后，随着疏散命令生效，首相出现在电视上，解释他宣布戒严的原因。

Only then the rest of the world was stunned with the annoucement.  
直到那时，世界其他地方才被这一公告震惊。

**Author's Notes**: Hi, readers… I'm back after weeks of having to grapple with some personal issues; can't say much about them but they almost stopped me from writing and thinking about the plot for this final season.  
**作者的话**：嗨，读者们…我回来了，几周来不得不处理一些个人问题；不能多说，但它们几乎让我停止了写作和对这一季终章情节的思考。

Over the years, there have been different fanfic interpretations of End of Eva, and thus in preparing for this work I personally read some of these revisions, with either hewing close to the original story with a sordid open end, or providing a clichéd, sugary 'happy ending'.  
多年来，关于《EVA 终》的同人解读层出不穷，因此在准备这部作品时，我亲自阅读了一些这样的改编，有的紧贴原故事情节，留下一个污秽的开放结局，有的则提供了一个俗套、甜腻的‘幸福结局’。

For ideas, I have also reviewed many fictional and real-life stories and historical accounts, especially those with epic final battles, harrowing sieges, with protagonists that seemed to be outnumbered and outgunned by a strong antagonist, surely to be crushed like a fly.  
为了获取灵感，我还回顾了许多虚构与现实的故事和历史记载，特别是那些以史诗般的最终决战、惊心动魄的围困为背景的作品，主角们似乎总是处于劣势，面对强大的反派，注定要像苍蝇一样被碾压。

I decided to make this Final Season more different and very sweeping, though, synthesizing much characters, stories and things that I have admired, and then putting them all together in one place, a spot between the hammer and the anvil, where their mettle will be put to the test.  
我决定让这最后一季更加与众不同且气势磅礴，融合了我所敬仰的众多角色、故事和元素，然后将它们汇聚于一处，置于锤砧之间，让他们的勇气在此接受考验。

Until then, thank you all as I'm gearing up for the next chapter.  
在此之前，感谢大家，我正为下一章节做准备。

### Chapter 42 Code Orange

It was almost an half hour since six in the morning, the sunlight filtering through the windows, its beam reaching out to the sleeping figure on the bed, her body covered by a blanket.  
已是清晨六点过半，阳光透过窗户洒落，一束光线探向床上熟睡的身影，她被毯子覆盖着。

Asuka lay almost quiet, with only the long rhythm of her breathing an indication that she was in deep sleep, after an entire night engaged in an emotional roller-coaster ride, which taxed her body to the point of exhaustion.  
明日香几乎静止不动，只有她悠长的呼吸声表明她正沉浸在深深的睡眠中，经过一整夜情感的过山车，她的身体已经疲惫到了极点。

But she knew that before falling onto this bed, it might as well be the last decent amount of peaceful sleep she could experience, for it became clear that as soon as she wakes up, she was sure the world around her would not be the same again.  
但她知道，在这张床上入睡之前，这可能是她能体验到的最后一次像样的平静睡眠了，因为一旦醒来，她确信周围的世界将不再相同。

Instead of peace, with the 'elimination' of the last known Angel, war was forthcoming.  
随着最后一位已知使徒的'消灭'，战争即将来临，取而代之的不是和平。

In what form, it was beyond her imagining, only hearing about the descriptions and factoids that Kaworu gave out on video, before she and her companions discovered him almost bleeding to death, his left arm gone with only a bleeding stump to prove it.  
她无法想象那会是何种形式，只是从视频中听到了 Kaworu 描述的各种细节和事实，直到她和同伴们发现他几乎因失血过多而濒临死亡，左臂消失，只剩一个流血的残肢作为证明。

Whether war or peace, as soon as she and Shinji came back on Misato's order for a full rest, Asuka dropped herself onto the bed, and to her surprise quickly went into slumber.  
无论是战争还是和平，一旦她和 Shinji 在 Misato 的命令下回来完全休息，Asuka 就会倒在床上，令她惊讶的是，她很快便进入了梦乡。

But not so for Shinji, who, at this moment and sitting on the side of the bed, his chin propped on a hand, was brooding, intensely contemplating about the unimaginable, the confrontation which could decide the fate of the world.  
但 Shinji 却不同，此刻他坐在床边，下巴支在手上，正沉思着，深切地思考着那些难以想象的、可能决定世界命运的对峙。

And all of it was hinged on what he may soon have to do, him being the sole pilot of Eva Unit-01, the purplish gargantuan slayer of Angels.  
这一切都取决于他即将不得不做的事情，他是 Eva 初号机的唯一驾驶员，那个紫色的巨型使徒杀手。

This sordid fact that has placed him on the harsh glare of the spotlight only served to deny him the right to a fitful sleep.  
这个令人不快的现实将他置于了聚光灯下的严酷审视中，仅仅是为了剥夺他安稳睡眠的权利。

Down at the secondary command center, directly below the ruined original, there was a marked increase in activity after the earlier ruckus at Terminal Dogma, as personnel went scurrying about, exchanging notes and data, all the while their eyes were trained at the situation board displayed on the main screen, monitoring the news feeds, the firewalls that secured the MAGI, radar sweeps, and perimeter security.  
在次级指挥中心，紧邻着被毁的原指挥中心下方，自终端教义区早先的骚动后，活动明显加剧，人员们四处奔忙，交换笔记和数据，同时他们的目光紧盯着主屏幕上显示的情况板，监控新闻动态、保护 MAGI 的防火墙、雷达扫描以及周边安全。

Since the supposed demise of Kaworu Nagisa, security has been tightened on Fuyutsuki's orders, which meant that any movement in and out of the complex has been restricted to all but only with the new Commander's permission.  
自卡沃鲁·纳吉亚被认为死亡后，在冬月命令下，安全措施已加强，这意味着进出综合设施的任何行动都仅限于新指挥官的许可。

On the upper bridge, Maya, Shigeru and Makoto were all having breakfast, consisting of filled tuna and melon buns and hot coffee.  
在上层桥上，真希波、四郎和诚正在享用早餐，包括夹心金枪鱼和蜜瓜包以及热咖啡。

"So there's not much of a choice, eh?" Maya asked as she nursed her drink. She was personally disappointed with the heightened security, which means that it would now be impossible to resume her daily off-duty routine of mending the laundry at her abode, an apartment complex just a kilometer away from Gate 14.  
"看来没什么选择的余地了，是吧？" 真希一边啜饮着饮料一边问道。她个人对加强的安保措施感到失望，这意味着她现在无法恢复日常的下班后习惯——在她住所修补衣物，她的公寓距离第 14 号闸门仅一公里。

Makoto pointed at the threat condition level at the main display, telling them they were currently at Code Yellow Level Alert (according to the _NERV_ _General_ _Operations_ _Manual_ _35-11_, there are five alert levels: _Code_ _Blue_, _Code_ _Yellow_, _Code_ _Orange_, _Code_ _Red_ _One_, and _Code_ _Red_ _Two_); the huge digital clock besides the threat meter also told everyone it was now 6:55 in the morning. He then took a sip and sighed.  
真琴指着主显示屏上的威胁等级，告诉他们目前处于黄色警戒级别（根据 NERV 总操作手册 35-11，共有五个警戒级别：蓝色代码、黄色代码、橙色代码、红色代码一和红色代码二）；威胁计量器旁边的大型数字时钟也显示现在是早上 6 点 55 分。他随后喝了一口，叹了口气。

"Yeah, we're still at level one," he answered. "But I don't think we're at peace anymore. Not with the crap we could be facing in the next forty-eight hours."  
"是的，我们还在一级，" 他回答道，"但我觉得我们不再安宁了。接下来的四十八小时我们可能要面对的麻烦可不少。"

Shigeru groaned and added, "No rest for the good guys,. Our job's not done yet, not with this Committee preparing to drop a freaking bomb on us."  
茂摇了摇头，叹道：“好人没休息，咱们的任务还没完，这个委员会正准备给我们扔颗重磅炸弹呢。”

"So what we should be doing, then?" Maya questioned.  
“那我们该怎么办？”真问道。

"I suppose we have to stick around, with our guns ready, not unless there's an unexpected sea change," Makoto said, and then his eyes caught on one of the satellite feeds broadcasting the news. It was a special announcement, but with the Prime Minister showing up in person, live from the executive office in Tokyo-2.  
“我想我们得随时待命，枪不离手，除非有什么意外的转机，”诚说，目光随即被一则新闻直播吸引。这是一条特别公告，首相亲自出镜，从东京-2 的行政办公室现场直播。

"Hey, look there!" Makoto exclaimed, his finger pointing at the suit sitting before an ornate table. "Listen up!"  
"嘿，看那边！" 真琴惊呼，手指指向坐在一张华丽桌子前的西装男子。"听好了！"

Shigeru and Maya were surprised. "What?" they questioned in unison.  
四郎和麻耶惊讶地问道："什么？" 他们异口同声。

_"…and effectively starting at seven in the morning today," the Prime Minister announced, "Executive Order A801 is now in full effect, which means, for national security reasons, government control and all institutions has been temporarily handed over to the military, and therefore, by the emergency powers granted to me by the members of parliament, to deal with the threat posed by the potential disaster that could happen within the Hakone region within seven days, I have signed this proclamation declaring martial law."  
"……并且从今天早上七点开始生效，" 首相宣布，"行政命令 A801 现已全面实施，这意味着出于国家安全考虑，政府控制及所有机构已暂时移交给军队，因此，根据国会议员授予我的紧急权力，为了应对七天内可能发生在箱根地区的潜在灾难威胁，我已签署此公告，宣布进入戒严状态。"_

The trio looked at each other in disbelief, and both upper and lower command bridges were hushed into shocked silence, as the bald-head went on explaining that for the duration of martial law period any civil liberties will be suspended and civilian movement be limited.  
三人面面相觑，难以置信，上下指挥桥上一片震惊的沉默，光头继续解释说，在戒严期间，任何公民自由都将被暂停，平民行动将受到限制。

"Martial… law?" Maya gasped.

"Yeah," Makoto confirmed before he picked up the phone and began dialing for Fuyutsuki's office. He could hear the old man take the receiver and then speak.  
“嗯，”真琴确认后拿起电话开始拨打冬月办公室的号码。他能听到老人拿起听筒然后说话。

"Yes?"

"Sir, we have an urgent development right now," Makoto said.  
“先生，我们现在有一个紧急情况，”真琴说道。

"What's going on?" "发生了什么事？"

"I am sorry to say this, but the Prime Minister has declared martial law."  
"很抱歉这么说，但首相已经宣布了戒严令。"

"What?" Fuyutsuki almost yelled right into his ear.  
"什么？" 冬月差点对着他的耳朵大喊起来。

Just then he heard the fax machine turning itself on, screeching, and it began to spit out a printed sheet. Makoto then ripped it off the feed and skimmed quickly, before going back to the phone.  
就在这时，他听到传真机自行启动，发出刺耳的声音，开始吐出一张打印纸。真琴迅速撕下纸张，匆匆浏览了一遍，然后回到电话旁。

"Where did you go?" Fuyutsuki demanded.  
“你去哪儿了？”冬月质问道。

"Sorry, sir, but there's a fax coming from the Prime Minister himself," Makoto replied. "Can I read it for you?"  
“抱歉，长官，首相本人发来了一份传真，”真琴回答，“需要我为您读一下吗？”

"Go ahead."

Makoto took a deep breath and read off the government communiqué, which demanded that within twenty-four hours NERV must stand down, hand over former Commander Gendo Ikari for state crimes (including treason and other violations of national security), and all personnel must leave the premises for military occupation, for the seizure of the Evas, weaponry, other related equipment and experiments, and the eventual shutdown and closure of the entire complex.  
真嗣深吸一口气，宣读了政府的公报，要求 NERV 在二十四小时内必须解散，交出前指挥官碇源堂因国家罪行（包括叛国和其他违反国家安全的行为），所有人员必须离开现场以便军队接管，没收 EVA、武器、相关设备和实验，并最终关闭整个设施。

Furthermore, all special rights and privileges previously extended to NERV have now been revoked and thus considered null and void, and to rub salt on the wound, the Prime Minister also had his signature affixed, along with those of the key members of the cabinet and the parliamentary leader.  
此外，之前授予 NERV 的所有特殊权利和特权现已撤销，因此被视为无效，而且为了加重打击，首相还亲自签名，内阁关键成员和议会领导人也一并签字。

"And what if we don't comply?" Fuyutsuki questioned thereafter.  
“如果我们不遵守呢？”冬月随后问道。

"They will use armed force with extreme prejudice," Makoto answered.  
“他们会毫不犹豫地使用武力，”真琴回答道。

What followed was silence from the other end of the line, the old man suddenly thinking hard, before he coughed and spoke.  
电话那头随之陷入了沉默，老人突然陷入深思，随后咳嗽一声，开口说道。

"Okay, tell the division chiefs, including Hamamoto, Katsuragi and Akagi, that I'll cancel the meeting right now," the old former professor ordered. "Instead, have everyone – even the Children – at the main auditorium immediately for an urgent announcement and a full emergency briefing,"  
“好的，告诉包括滨本、葛城和赤木在内的各部门负责人，我现在就取消会议，”前教授老者命令道。“相反，让所有人——包括孩子们——立即到主礼堂集合，进行紧急公告和全面紧急简报，”

"What about those who couldn't get there, sir?"  
"那些无法到达现场的人怎么办，先生？"

"Set up for a full closed-circuit broadcast, so that they'll catch it and watch. I'll get ready to talk to everyone about this matter and what we must do. Is that clear?"  
"设置全封闭电路广播，让他们能够接收并观看。我会准备好向所有人讲述这件事以及我们必须采取的行动。清楚了吗？"

"Yes, sir," Makoto agreed as he looked at Shigeru and Maya, waiting for him.  
"是的，先生，" 真琴同意道，同时看着茂和真弥，等待着他。

"Do it."

---

They were on their way now, walking along the corridor at a brisk, urgent pace.  
他们现在正走在路上，沿着走廊以一种轻快而急迫的步伐前进。

Kaworu and Rei were together, their hands clasped, their eyes filled with determination and purpose, but they were no longer dressed in their all-too-familiar school uniforms but in shirts and jeans. In their minds there was no doubt denying that soon they would have a huge role to play in the forthcoming calamity, the aces in the sleeve should the going becomes tough.  
渚薰和绫波零并肩而行，双手紧握，眼中充满了决心和目标，但他们已不再穿着那熟悉的校服，而是换上了衬衫和牛仔裤。在他们心中，毫无疑问地意识到，即将到来的灾难中，他们将扮演至关重要的角色，成为关键时刻的王牌。

Abreast of them were Misato and Ritsuko, just as grim as they walked in unison, armed with available knowledge about their respective crafts, warfare and science. The former also hand-carried the steel box which contained all of Kaji's obtained secrets, the latter with Misato's laptop in its bag, its strap holding onto her shoulder.  
在他们身旁的是美里和律子，同样面色凝重地同步前行，各自携带着关于战争与科学的知识。前者手中提着装有加持所获所有秘密的钢盒，后者则肩挎着美里的笔记本电脑包。

In Misato's mind she knew that, being the Director of Operations, they would naturally look up to her as their chief strategist, having previously studied at a military academy, learning about warfare and conflict while simultaneously understanding what it took to prevent another form of armed conflict.  
在美里心中，她清楚作为作战部主任，大家自然会仰仗她这位首席战略家，毕竟她曾在军事学院深造，学习过战争与冲突的知识，同时明白如何防止另一种武装冲突的发生。

On the other hand, although a scientist by profession, Ritsuko was a woman learned in dealing with two other kinds of warfare: that of defending computer networks, and of treating and preventing disease and death.  
另一方面，尽管身为科学家，律子也是一位精通两种其他战争的女性：一是保卫计算机网络，二是治疗和预防疾病与死亡。

Both women knew that they have a long way to go, and in the event should the balloon goes up, their years of knowledge and experience would come in handy.  
两位女士都明白，前路漫漫，一旦情况紧急，她们多年的知识和经验将派上用场。

Just then Misato felt, rather than hear, her phone vibrating. Not missing a beat as they walked, she fished the phone out of her pocket, made a brief glance at the display (it was Makoto calling her) and pressed a key.  
就在那时，Misato 感觉到，而不是听到，她的手机在震动。他们一边走，她一边不慌不忙地从口袋里掏出手机，迅速瞥了一眼屏幕（是 Makoto 打来的），然后按下一个键。

"Yeah?" she asked. “嗯？”她问道。

"Situation has gone critical," Makoto answered. "The Prime Minister has declared martial law, and also issued Executive Order A801."  
“情况已经变得非常严重，”Makoto 回答，“首相宣布了戒严令，并且发布了 A801 号行政命令。”

In shock, Misato almost tripped her feet on that one, nearly dropping her load. Ritsuko, Kaworu and Rei noted this and halted in mid-stride.  
震惊之下，美里差点被绊倒，险些摔了手中的东西。律子、薰和丽注意到了这一幕，随即停下了脚步。

At the same time the base PA repeatedly announced the new alert status: _Code_ _Orange_. This was then followed by a request for all personnel to come to the auditorium for an emergency general meeting; those who cannot attend may also use the close-circuit television network and video streaming to watch the proceedings.  
与此同时，基地的公共广播系统反复宣布新的警戒状态：橙色代码。随后，要求所有人员前往礼堂参加紧急全体会议；无法到场的人员也可通过闭路电视网络和视频直播观看会议进程。

"Are you okay?" Kaworu asked.  
“你还好吗？”薰问道。

Misato struggled to get up on her feet. "Y… Yeah," she said, getting the phone close to her ear. "All right, what the hell that means?" she questioned Makoto.  
美里挣扎着站起来。“嗯……嗯，”她将电话贴近耳朵，“好吧，这到底是什么意思？”她问真琴。

"We're screwed: no special protection, rights or privileges for us, and therefore all of what we have here should be handed over to the _Jietai_ within twenty-four hours_._"  
“我们完蛋了：没有特殊保护、权利或特权，因此我们这里的一切都必须在二十四小时内交给自卫队。”

"Including the Evas?" “包括 EVA 吗？”

"Damn right… and Ikari, too, for state crimes. That's the ultimatum."  
"没错……还有碇，因为国家罪行。这就是最后通牒。"

Misato made a sour face. "What if we don't?"  
美里皱起了眉头。“如果我们不呢？”

"They'll blow us out to kingdom come."  
“他们会把我们炸得灰飞烟灭。”

"Shit," she cursed. "Now what?"  
"该死，"她咒骂道。"现在怎么办？"

"Commander Fuyutsuki has now cancelled the meeting," Makoto replied, "so instead you'll have to head to the auditorium within ten to twenty minutes. Who's with you now?"  
"葛城美里指挥官已经取消了会议，"真希波回答，"所以你们需要在十到二十分钟内前往礼堂。现在谁和你在一起？"

"I have Ritsuko with me, plus Kaworu and Rei. We're bringing all of Kaji's stuff, and we're supposed to present it at the meeting."  
"我和律子在一起，还有薰和绫波。我们带着所有加持的东西，应该在会议上展示。"

"Okay, but what about Shinji and Asuka?"  
“好吧，那真嗣和明日香呢？”

"They're taking a rest at my quarters in the BOQ."  
“他们在我宿舍的 BOQ 休息。”

"The Commander also needs them, too."  
“司令也需要他们。”

As if asking for an agreement, Misato turned to Ritsuko and the two Children, and they all nodded.  
仿佛在寻求同意，美里转向律子和两位孩子，他们都点了点头。

"All right, we'll pick them up," she said. "Keep me updated, okay?"  
“好的，我们会去接他们，”她说。“随时向我汇报，好吗？”

"Roger, and I'll meet you there," Makoto concluded before shutting off the line.  
“收到，我们那里见，”真琴总结道，随后挂断了电话。

With a mug of hot chocolate Shinji walked over to the bay windows that gave him the whole panoramic view of the Geofront. He tried to imagine what would be like in case the worst would come.  
手捧一杯热巧克力，真嗣走向那扇能让他一览无余地俯瞰第三新东京市的落地窗。他试图想象，如果最坏的情况发生，那会是什么样子。

As he took a sip, Shinji could picture himself right in the cockpit of his entry plug, armed to the teeth and waiting for their foes to come. But how they look like? Do they bear resemblance to the ill-fated Unit-03, in which he nearly killed Toji? Or do they look more monstrous than Unit-01?  
当他啜饮一口时，真嗣仿佛置身于自己的插入栓内，全副武装，等待敌人的到来。但他们会长什么样呢？他们是否与那不幸的 03 号机相似，那次他差点杀死了剑介？还是说，他们比 01 号机更加狰狞？

What about those who could invade the Geofront? In what form they might come?  
那些可能入侵第三新东京市的敌人，又会以何种形态出现呢？

Trying to answer those questions, Shinji then dimly remembered his history lessons, especially those concerning the Pacific War, as World War Two was referred to by most Japanese. More specifically, on the pages of government-published history textbooks there were brief passages about the American invasion of the island of Iwo Jima, followed by the assault on the island of Okinawa.  
试图回答这些问题，真嗣隐约记起了他的历史课，尤其是关于太平洋战争的部分，这是大多数日本人所称的第二次世界大战。更具体地说，在政府出版的历史教科书页面上，有关于美国入侵硫磺岛的简短段落，随后是对冲绳岛的进攻。

This time it was hard for him to imagine an immense army appearing out of nowhere, with all of their soldiers and tanks and planes arrayed in neat formations, their arsenal aimed squarely at this very building.  
这一次，他很难想象一支庞大的军队会凭空出现，所有的士兵、坦克和飞机整齐排列，他们的武器正对准这座建筑。

Wondering what was going on in the outside world, he went over to the television set and switched it on, only to find himself coming face to face with the newscaster, talking about the martial law declaration.  
想知道外界发生了什么，他走到电视机前并打开它，却发现自己正面对着新闻播报员，正在谈论戒严令的宣布。

"What the…?" Shinji mumbled in near-astonishment as he listened.  
"这是……什么情况？" 真嗣近乎惊讶地喃喃自语，一边听着。

_"…martial law is now in effect," the newscaster said, reciting off the Teleprompter, "which means that the entire country is under military control. To minimize civilian casualties in anticipation of a possible catastrophic disaster, which at this point in time has not been identified or explained by the government, a security cordon has also been drawn around the Hakone region, and all civilians living within the 80-kilometer danger zone are advised to evacuate immediately.  
"……现在全国实施了军事管制，" 新闻播报员照着提词器念道，"这意味着整个国家处于军事控制之下。为了在可能发生的灾难性事件中尽量减少平民伤亡——截至目前，政府尚未明确或解释这一事件的性质——已在箱根地区周围划定了安全隔离带，并建议居住在 80 公里危险区内的所有平民立即撤离。_

_"The Prime Minister has assured that the government is taking strict measures to contain and control the crisis, although they are not in liberty to disclose the exact nature of the calamity."  
"首相已保证政府正在采取严格措施来遏制和控制危机，尽管他们不便透露灾难的确切性质。_

Deciding not to hesitate any further, Shinji walked to the bed, and shook Asuka's shoulder.  
决定不再犹豫，真嗣走向床边，摇了摇明日香的肩膀。

"W… What?" the redhead moaned, trying to ignore him.  
“什…什么？”红发少女呻吟着，试图忽视他。

"Wake up," Shinji whispered. "Today's really bad."  
“醒醒，”真嗣低声说，“今天真的很糟糕。”

Asuka cracked open an eye and stared at him. "What do you mean?" she quietly demanded as Shinji pointed his finger at the television, which prompted her to sit upright and stare at the tube.  
明日香微微睁开一只眼，盯着他。“你什么意思？”她低声质问，同时真嗣用手指向电视机，这让她坐直身子，目光紧盯屏幕。

"They declared martial law," he said.  
“他们宣布了戒严令，”他说。

Asuka couldn't believe what she was hearing from the newscaster. "What? Isn't it too fucking early?" she rudely remarked.  
明日香无法相信新闻播报员所说的话。“什么？不是太他妈早了吗？”她粗鲁地评论道。

"Seems that they also knew what happened last night."  
"看来他们也知道昨晚发生的事了。"

"Yeah, must be that damn spy who brought the word out," she said, but then noticed Shinji's half-full mug of cocoa. "Can you make one for me?"  
"是啊，肯定是那个该死的间谍泄露了消息，"" 她说着，随即注意到真嗣那杯只喝了一半的可可。""能给我也做一杯吗？"

Shinji nodded. "Sure," he said with a smile.  
真嗣点点头。""当然，"" 他微笑着说。

The young man walked to the kitchenette and prepared another for Asuka, before coming back and handed her the steaming mug. With Shinji sitting besides her, they drank slowly in unison as they listened to the broadcast.  
年轻人走向小厨房，为明日香准备了一杯，然后回来递给她那冒着热气的杯子。真嗣坐在她旁边，他们一起慢慢地喝着，同时听着广播。

"So what we should do about this?" Shinji asked while the anchorman droned on, exchanging words with a correspondent in downtown Tokyo-2.  
“那我们该怎么办呢？”真嗣在主播单调地与东京-2 市中心的记者交谈时问道。

"Scare them, I suppose," Asuka replied. "I know their bullets can only bounce off those Angels, and so do our Evas… But for the new Evas, I'm not sure about them, not unless Kaworu tells us more about them. Is Misato at the meeting?"  
“吓唬他们吧，我想，”明日香回答，“我知道他们的子弹只能从那些使徒身上弹开，我们的 EVA 也一样……但对于新的 EVA，我不太确定，除非渚能告诉我们更多。美里在开会吗？”

Shinji glanced at the wall clock. "Yeah, I think so," he said.  
真嗣瞥了一眼墙上的时钟。“嗯，我想是的，”他说。

The Second Children rolled off the bed and stood up. "We're going," she said. "I'm not going to stick around, waiting for the bullets to fly."  
第二适格者从床上滚了下来，站起身。“我们走吧，”她说。“我不想留在这里，等着子弹飞来。”

"But… I've yet to go to sleep," Shinji relented.  
“但是……我还没睡觉呢，”真嗣让步道。

"No procrastination this time, dummy," Asuka chided, as she grabbed her towel and went into the bathroom. "Not when the shit's about to hit the fan," she added.  
“这次别再拖延了，傻瓜，”明日香责备道，抓起毛巾走进浴室。“眼看就要大难临头了，”她补充说。

At the Infirmary, in one of its rooms, heavily guarded by Second Section men in full combat gear, Gendo Ikari was unconscious to the world, his whole body bound to the bed by nylon straps, his right wrist hand-cuffed to the side railings, and his left hand was completely wrapped in bandage. An IV tube ran from the bottle to his left shoulder, and so far the sedative in his bloodstream kept him in artificial slumber.  
在医务室的一个房间里，被第二课全副武装的人员严密看守着，碇源堂对外界毫无知觉，全身被尼龙带束缚在床上，右手腕被手铐固定在侧栏杆上，左手完全包裹着绷带。一根静脉注射管从瓶子连接到他的左肩，目前血液中的镇静剂让他处于人工昏迷状态。

Through the thick glass window, Tsutomo Kanzaki observed the ousted ex-Commander, wondered what demons had told him to transform from a complete nobody to a very powerful leader. He also imagined what that man's life was once used to be before the transformation of personality.  
透过厚厚的玻璃窗，Tsutomo Kanzaki 观察着被罢免的前司令，想知道是什么恶魔让他从一个无名小卒变成了一个非常强大的领导者。他还想象着那个男人在性格转变之前的生活是怎样的。

Maybe, he thought, Misato has all the dirt on Ikari, so that he could study them later and to understand his motivations for single-handedly creating a powerful quasi-military entity from out of a lightly-staffed research body.  
或许，他想，美里掌握着关于碇的所有秘密，这样他就可以稍后研究它们，理解他为何能单枪匹马地从一个人手不足的研究机构中打造出一个强大的准军事实体。

"You want some coffee?" a voice asked Tsutomo, and he swung around to see Takako Chigusa with a can of coffee; she was also dressed in her usual nursing uniform.  
“想喝点咖啡吗？”一个声音问津友，他转身看到千草贵子拿着一罐咖啡；她同样穿着她那惯常的护士制服。

Tsutomo shook his head. "No, it's okay, I already had one minutes ago," he said. "Where's Doctor Odani?"  
津友摇了摇头。“不用了，谢谢，我几分钟前刚喝过，”他说。“尾谷医生呢？”

"She's now on her way to the meeting," Takako answered.  
"她现在正前往会议的路上，"高子回答道。

"Ah," Tsutomo said. "How's it going?"  
"啊，"堤文说。"情况怎么样？"

"Nothing eventful since the operation; did my usual rounds, and so far some of your agents are okay," she said, referring to the dozen or so men who were wounded during the attack on Asuka's convoy days earlier, and now recuperating from their injuries.  
"手术后一切如常；我照常巡视，目前你的几名特工情况还好，"她指的是几天前在袭击明日香车队时受伤的那十几名男子，他们现在正在康复中。

"I see. Do you have any family?"  
"我明白了。你有家人吗？"

Takako nodded. "Yeah," she answered. "I have a family back in Kagawa; a sister in high school and two of my parents." Kagawa was a small city located on the island of Shikoku.  
高子点点头。“嗯，”她回答，“我在香川有家人；一个上高中的妹妹和我的父母。”香川是一个位于四国岛的小城市。

"How they're doing?" "他们还好吗？"

"They're all fine, but I'll try to call them later."  
"他们都很好，不过我稍后再试着联系他们。"

Tsutomo blinked. "Why not now?"  
筒友眨了眨眼。“为什么不现在？”

"Okay," Takako said before she glanced at the unconscious Ikari behind the window. "I wonder what would be his reaction once he wakes up," she remarked, knowing that earlier she participated in the surgery.  
"好吧，" 高子说，然后瞥了一眼窗后昏迷的五十里。“我想知道他醒来后会有什么反应，”她评论道，知道之前她参与了手术。

"Along with his ouster, he could be in for a very rude awakening."  
随着他的下台，他可能会迎来一个非常残酷的现实。

Only then they heard the PA announce the declaration of Code Orange, along with an urgent notice for all available personnel to attend the emergency general meeting at the base auditorium.  
直到那时，他们才听到广播宣布橙色警报的声明，并紧急通知所有可用人员参加在基地礼堂举行的紧急全体会议。

---

Meanwhile, the JSDF general was burly, stood five-foot-six tall, fifty-five years old, dressed in the standard Type II flecktarn pattern-green BDU, and on his blouse had the kanji for his name, _MG_ _Yamamoto_, stitched onto the nametape.  
与此同时，自卫队将军身材魁梧，身高五英尺六英寸，五十五岁，身穿标准的 II 型斑点迷彩绿色 BDU，他的衬衫上缝有他的名字——山本中将——的汉字。

At the moment, his division stationed at a staging point in the outskirts of Mishima, Major General Minoru Yamamoto of the Eastern Army's 1st Division, a distant blood relative of the famous admiral who took over the Pacific almost overnight, was surveying the verdant mountains that shielded Hakone from the rest of the world, making the volcanic caldera a natural, seemingly impenetrable fortress.  
此刻，驻扎在三岛郊外集结点的是东部军第 1 师，师长山本稔少将，他是那位几乎一夜之间掌控太平洋的著名海军上将的远亲。山本少将正眺望着青翠的山脉，这些山脉将箱根与外界隔绝，使其火山口成为一座天然的、看似坚不可摧的堡垒。

Standing alongside him was his aide, a lieutenant-colonel named Urusawa, and as they stared up at the mountains, with rows of tanks and APCs parked behind them, they were drinking from cans of coffee and smoking cigarettes.  
站在他身旁的是他的副官，一位名叫漆泽的陆军中校。他们抬头望着山峰，身后是一排排坦克和装甲车，两人正喝着罐装咖啡，抽着香烟。

Yamamoto took a drag from his cigarette, and exhaled. He then pointed at the peaks and remarked, "You know, I never thought this is going to happen in my lifetime."  
山本吸了一口烟，然后吐出。他指向山峰，感慨道：“你知道吗，我从没想过在我有生之年会发生这样的事。”

"Why, sir?" Urusawa asked. The younger officer was assigned to Yamamoto two months before, so right now he was going to receive an anecdote.  
“为什么，先生？”宇佐川问道。这位年轻军官两个月前被分配到山本手下，所以现在他将听到一个轶事。

"I was there almost a year before," the general began, "the first and only time, with Ito and Kutaragi sitting our asses at the command bridge, with Commander Ikari watching right behind us, when that fucking Angel wiped out three armored brigades and two gunship squadrons right before our very eyeballs. All that after we threw everything and even the kitchen sink tipped with an N2 warhead, right on top of that Angel's head. We were all upset for the rest of the time, right until that kid and his Eva went up there and put the damned thing out of its misery… in a few minutes."  
“我在那里几乎待了一年，”将军开始讲述，“那是我第一次也是唯一一次，和伊藤以及久田坐在指挥桥上，伊卡里指挥官就在我们身后盯着，那时那个该死的使徒在我们眼皮底下摧毁了三个装甲旅和两个武装直升机中队。在那之前，我们把所有东西都扔了出去，甚至连装有 N2 弹头的厨房水槽都砸在了那个使徒的头上。我们之后一直都很沮丧，直到那个孩子和他的 EVA 上去，在几分钟内把那该死的东西解决了。”

Urusawa nodded. 宇佐川点点头。

"Later that night," Yamamoto went on, "we were so damn mad that we took ourselves to drink, blamed ourselves and wondered what the fuck we have to tell to the weeping mothers and girlfriends who lost their boys right there… Told them later they fought bravely, almost enough for those boys to earn a spot at Yasukuni."  
"那天深夜，"山本继续说道，"我们气得要命，于是自己去喝酒，责怪自己，想着该怎么对那些失去儿子的母亲和女友们说……后来告诉她们，她们的孩子们战斗得很勇敢，几乎足以让他们在靖国神社占有一席之地。"

The general and his aide paused for a moment to finish the coffee and cigarettes, and then threw the dregs into an open fifty-five gallon drum. Yamamoto then composed himself and took a deep breath.  
将军和他的副官停顿了一下，喝完咖啡抽完烟，然后将烟蒂扔进一个敞开的五十加仑桶里。山本随后整理了一下自己，深吸了一口气。

"Now here's the big deal: we're about to launch the biggest offensive since Pearl Harbor, and we're going to shut them down if they don't do what The Man says. That is, we'll have to take out first the people operating and fixing the Evas."  
"现在有个大动作：我们即将发动自珍珠港以来最大规模的攻势，如果他们不听从那位大人物的话，我们就会让他们闭嘴。也就是说，我们必须先解决那些操作和维修 Eva 的人。"

"Excuse me, sir, but are you saying you do have some doubts about this operation?" Urusawa asked, as a trio of helicopter gunships roared over their heads.  
“不好意思，先生，您的意思是您对这次行动有所疑虑吗？”宇佐美问道，此时三架武装直升机轰鸣着从他们头顶掠过。

The question almost caught Yamamoto off-guard, prompting him to think for a moment, amidst the din of the boots of marching companies stomping as they went, tanks rumbling to life as they prepare to leave their parking spaces, and helicopters taking off from their landing pads.  
这个问题几乎让山本措手不及，他不得不在行进中连队士兵的靴子声、准备驶离停车位的坦克轰鸣声以及直升机从停机坪起飞的喧嚣中思考片刻。

"No… It's not that," the general said at last. "I mean, since that first day there, on and off I've been working with those guys, especially with that Katsuragi woman, and… Basically they're good, smart people, but personally… between that and the bad news we got on NERV, as much as we have done some good rapport with these people in the past, I'm afraid that, within less than twenty-four hours… we'll have no option but to destroy them _first_ before they could destroy us all."  
“不……不是那样的，”将军最终说道，“我的意思是，自从那天起，我断断续续地与那些人合作，尤其是与那个葛城女士，而且……基本上他们都是优秀、聪明的人，但就个人而言……在 NERV 的坏消息和我们之间，尽管过去我们与这些人建立了良好的关系，我担心在不到二十四小时内……我们将别无选择，只能先摧毁他们，以免他们摧毁我们所有人。”

_And_ _once_ _I__'**m_ _done_ _with_ _this_ _killing_ _business,_ Yamamoto concluded in his thoughts, _that**'**s_ _it,_ _I**'**m_ _going_ _to_ _toss_ _in_ _the_ _resignation_ _letter_ _right_ _on_ _the_ _PM**'__s_ _desk,_ _pack_ _up_ _my_ _junk_ _and_ _haul_ _ass_ _back_ _to_ _Yubari._  
一旦我完成了这杀戮之事，山本在心中总结道，那就这样吧，我要把辞职信直接甩在首相的桌上，收拾好我的杂物，然后滚回夕张。

---

They were nearly finished dressing up when Shinji, almost having his white sneakers tied, heard the knocking on the door.  
他们几乎穿好衣服时，真嗣几乎要系好白色运动鞋的鞋带，这时听到了敲门声。

"Check who's outside," Asuka said while buttoning up her pink shirt right in front of the mirror; she was also wearing a pair of jeans and Keds.  
去看看是谁在外面，" 明日香一边对着镜子扣上她的粉色衬衫，一边说道；她同样穿着一条牛仔裤和一双 Keds。

Nodding, Shinji walked over to the door and opened it, to find Misato standing before the threshold, with Ritsuko, Kaworu and Rei behind her.  
点了点头，真嗣走向门口并打开它，发现美里站在门槛前，身后跟着律子、薰和丽。

"Uh… You're picking us up?" Shinji asked.  
“呃…你是来接我们的吗？”真嗣问道。

"That's right," Misato answered as they walked in, and she set the bagged steel box on the floor. "How did you know we're coming?"  
“没错，”美里一边回答一边走进来，将装在袋子里的钢盒放在地上。“你是怎么知道我们要来的？”

"Martial law's declared on TV," Asuka answered, before she noted that Kaworu's arm was whole again, so in awe she said, "Wow, how that happened? I mean, what happened to your arm? The last time I saw it I thought it looked pretty hopeless it could've taken up to a year."  
"电视上宣布了戒严令，" 明日香回答，随后注意到渚薰的手臂已经完好无损，惊叹道，"哇，这是怎么回事？我是说，你的手臂怎么了？上次我看到它时，我还以为它看起来相当无望，可能需要一年时间才能恢复。"

"It's regeneration, my dear," Kaworu answered with amusement as he showed his completed left arm. "Has to do with my physiology, which is different from a normal human being, but that doesn't mean I'm invincible."  
"这是再生，亲爱的，" 渚薰带着一丝戏谑回答，展示着他完好的左臂。"这与我的生理结构有关，不同于普通人类，但这并不意味着我是无敌的。"

"I see," Asuka said.

Somewhat still famished, the Fifth Children then espied a pair of filled melon buns (_melopan_) on the dinner table. "May I have one?" he asked. "I'm really hungry."  
第五适格者仍然感到有些饥饿，他看到餐桌上有一对装满的蜜瓜包（melopan）。"我可以吃一个吗？"他问道。"我真的饿了。"

"No big deal," the redhead said before Kaworu thanked her, picked up one of them from the table, tore open the plastic packaging, before he sank his teeth into the bun.  
"没什么大不了的，"红发女孩说道，随后渚薰向她道谢，从桌上拿起一个，撕开塑料包装，咬了一口面包。

"Even Angels have their own limits," Rei added as she hugged Shinji. "Good morning, my brother."  
"即使是天使也有自己的极限，"绫波丽补充道，同时拥抱了真嗣。"早上好，我的兄弟。"

Shinji blushed. "Thanks," he replied before he resumed tying his sneakers. "Have you slept?"  
真嗣脸红了。"谢谢，"他回答，然后继续系鞋带。"你睡了吗？"

Rei shook her head. "No, I merely dozed for an hour while keeping an eye on him."  
丽摇了摇头。“不，我只是打了个盹，同时留意着他。”

"All right, let's get to the point, boys and girls," Misato finally chimed in. "Right now, no meeting, but instead we're all heading to the auditorium for a full-blown briefing. Everyone's needed to be there because that's where we're going to decide the future of the world."  
“好了，孩子们，我们直入主题，”美里终于插话道，“现在，没有会议，但我们都要去礼堂参加一个全面的简报会。每个人都需要到场，因为我们将在这里决定世界的未来。”

"And everything falls on me, right?" Shinji asked, a bit of trepidation within his heart.  
“一切责任都落在我身上，对吧？”真嗣问道，心中不免有些忐忑。

"Yeah," Misato agreed. "But you're not alone, for we're all in the same boat as you do, and it's shared danger."  
“嗯，”美里同意道，“但你并不孤单，因为我们都在同一条船上，共同面对危险。”

**Author****'****s** **Notes:** I apologize for the very long gap, due to many distractions contributing to my writer's block, including a personal malaise that plagued me for weeks. Within the period I had to imagine hard, trying to find a way to get this chapter going when I decided to go from scratch and write straight ahead.  
作者**注**：对于这次长时间的间隔，我深感歉意，诸多干扰导致了我写作障碍，包括困扰我数周的个人困境。在那段时间里，我不得不努力构思，试图找到让这部chapter重新启动的方法，最终我决定从头开始，直接动笔写作。

There's a change in this chapter; for the sake of consistency, identification and realism, instead of the black combat uniforms used by the JSDF in EoE, I chose the real-life standard flecktarn camo uniform as utilized by those forces.  
这部chapter有所改动；为了保持一致性、辨识度和真实性，我放弃了 EoE 中日本自卫队使用的黑色战斗服，而是选择了现实中这些部队使用的标准 flecktarn 迷彩服。

OBTW, Yubari is a mining town in the northern island of Hokkaido.  
顺便提一下，夕张是北海道北部的一个矿业小镇。

### Chapter 43 Unilateral Declaration of Defiance  
Chapter 43 单方面宣言的反抗

Back at the staging base in Siberia, Keel Lorenz was in his office, sitting behind his desk and reading one of several reports for the day, when he heard someone knocking on his door.  
在西伯利亚的集结基地，基尔·洛伦茨正在办公室里，坐在桌后阅读当天的几份报告，这时他听到有人敲门。

"Come in," the old man said.  
"进来吧," 老人说道。

The door slid open and a robed man entered. He then stood before the desk and cleared his throat.  
门滑开了，一个身披长袍的男人走了进来。他随即站在桌前，清了清嗓子。

"So?" Keel said. "所以呢？" 基尔问道。

"There is a development in the situation," the acolyte said. "The Prime Minister has declared martial law, which means they're acting ahead without our authorization."  
"局势有了新的进展，" 侍僧说道，"首相已宣布戒严，这意味着他们未经我们授权就先行采取了行动。"

Keel frowned. "What?" 基尔皱起眉头。"什么？"

"He has placed the military on full alert, including those pre-positioned around Tokyo-3, which means at any moment they could attack. We have also intercepted and decrypted a fax that was sent to NERV headquarters." The acolyte then produced a sheet of paper and placed it on the desk, which Keel picked up and read.  
"他已将军队全面警戒，包括部署在第三新东京市周边的部队，这意味着他们随时可能发起攻击。我们还截获并破译了一份发往 NERV 总部的传真。" 侍僧随后拿出一张纸放在桌上，基尔拿起并阅读。

"So… He wants Ikari on a silver platter and NERV to surrender everything," Keel said. "Well, fine, let him have it and if possible, make things easier for us should they're done with destroying the base and everything in it."  
"所以…他想要碇源堂乖乖就范，让 NERV 交出一切，"基尔说。"好吧，随他去，如果可能的话，在他们摧毁基地和里面的一切之后，尽量让我们的事情变得简单些。"

The acolyte nodded. "Master, what do you wish to for us to do next?"  
侍从点头。"主人，您希望我们接下来做什么？"

Keel reached out for the phone on his desk and began dialing the number for Colonel Quaritch.  
基尔伸手拿起桌上的电话，开始拨打夸里奇上校的号码。

"Yes?" the man at the other end of the line answered.  
"什么事？"电话那头的人回答道。

"Prepare your men," Keel said. "We will attack tomorrow at dawn."  
"让你的手下做好准备，"基尔说。"我们将在黎明时分发起攻击。"

"They are already at standby, sir," Quaritch answered. "We also know that the Russian Pacific Fleet has left Vladivostok yesterday morning and due to arrive near Sagami Bay by 0900 hours tomorrow, with the ballistic missile subs coming in there first. The Japanese will assume that the fleet will be on their annual readiness exercises in international waters, but not until we give them the order to attack."  
"他们已经待命，长官，"夸里奇回答。"我们还得知俄罗斯太平洋舰队已于昨天上午离开符拉迪沃斯托克，预计明天上午 9 点抵达相模湾附近，弹道导弹潜艇将率先抵达。日本人会以为舰队正在进行年度战备演习，但直到我们下达攻击命令之前，他们不会有所行动。"

"Good," Keel approved. He then made a mental note to set up a final meeting at the holographic conference room at two in the afternoon; he intended to confront Gendo Ikari, not knowing that his enemy has already been removed from office.  
“好，”基尔赞同道。他随即在心中记下，要在下午两点在全息会议室安排一次最终会议；他打算与碇源堂对峙，却不知他的敌人已被免职。

The immense auditorium, located two levels below the ground, was spacious enough to accommodate as many as 10,000 people in one sitting. It had seen its share of big events, including concerts, academic lectures and symposiums, film showings, and other special occasions.  
这座庞大的礼堂位于地下两层，空间宽敞到足以容纳多达一万人在同一时间就座。它见证了许多大型活动，包括音乐会、学术讲座和研讨会、电影放映以及其他特殊场合。

At this moment it was now full, with everyone on their feet, talking and speculating, debating and arguing the uncertainty they were facing. Some of them voiced their concerns and fears, worried about their families or for their own lives. Others nervously talked of the impending assault, with the _Jietai_ now in full control of the country.  
此刻，礼堂内座无虚席，所有人都站立着，议论纷纷，猜测、争论着他们所面临的不确定性。有些人表达了自己的担忧和恐惧，担心家人或自己的生命安全。其他人则紧张地谈论着即将到来的攻击，如今杰泰已全面掌控了国家。

---

Backstage, Misato stood before Commander Fuyutsuki, wearing a grim expression on his face, the burden of official responsibility now on his shoulders. The Children flanked her as they listened to their conversation; the other officers and division chiefs likewise ringed around them, ready to take mental notes.  
后台，美里站在指挥官冬月面前，脸上带着严肃的表情，肩负着官方责任的沉重。孩子们站在她两侧，聆听着他们的对话；其他官员和部门负责人也围在他们周围，准备随时记录要点。

"So Colonel," Fuyutsuki said. "It seems that the Prime Minister is acting ahead of schedule."  
"那么，司令，" 冬月说。"看来首相提前行动了。"

"That's right, sir," Misato replied sourly. "Probably one of the spies gave him forewarning and even told about this morning's uproar. Yes, he's in Keel's payroll, but judging from his initial moves, I'd say the government is acting independently of SEELE's control."  
"是的，长官，" 美里不悦地回答。"可能是某个间谍提前给他通风报信，甚至提到了今早的骚动。没错，他在基尔的工资单上，但从他最初的行动来看，我认为政府正在独立于 Seele 的控制行事。"

Director Hamamoto stepped forward and added, "There's something I like to say about Oda's phone, sir."  
滨本主任上前一步补充道："关于织田的电话，长官，我有话要说。"

"Yes?" Fuyutsuki asked. “喂？”冬月问道。

"We found that one of the numbers in his phone has been traced to an unlisted number, which is somewhere in Tokyo-2," Hamamoto reported. "That phone turned out to a number belonging to the Ministry of the Interior, which explains why the Prime Minister has gone forward on his own initiative."  
"我们发现他手机里的一个号码被追踪到了东京-2 的一个未公开号码，" 滨本报告说。"那个电话号码最终属于内务省，这解释了为什么首相会自行其是。"

"So we're too late, right?" Misato said. "He pushed the panic button."  
"所以我们还是晚了一步，对吧？" 美里说。"他按下了紧急按钮。"

"Damn late yes, like we're locking the barn door after the horse got away, but time is still on our side, even if we only have a day left to prepare," the former naval intelligence officer said.  
"确实晚了，就像马跑了才锁谷仓门，但我们还有时间，即使只剩下一天准备，" 这位前海军情报官员说。"

"We can speculate further," Fuyutsuki said to Misato, "but for now we have to keep on eye on the _Jietai,_ and at the same time I hope you have finally come up with a contingency plan for this eventuality."  
"我们可以进一步推测，" 冬月对美里说，"但目前我们必须密切关注自卫队，同时我希望你终于为这种可能性制定了一个应急计划。"

Misato nodded. "It's in my head since two days ago, sir," she said. "I studied this scenario just after I reckoned that the Committee would be doing something really nasty on us, what with the evidence Kaji had on them, including their future objectives."  
美里点头。"两天前就在我脑子里了，长官，" 她说。"我一想到委员会会对我们做出什么恶劣的事情，就研究了这个方案，包括加持掌握的证据和他们未来的目标。"

"I see. How this plan of yours be executed?"  
"我明白了。你的计划将如何执行？"

"Basically, what we need to protect, sir," Misato replied, "are several: the MAGI and the command center, the Evas, Lilith down below Terminal Dogma, and of course, Adam. These must not fall into enemy hands should they attack in force, and we're not going to let them have it all with their dirty paws. So I'm going to give them the truth and explain everything to them," she said, pointing at her would-be audience outside, before she turned to Makoto. "Get my laptop and the projector ready."  
"基本上，我们需要保护的东西，长官，" 美里回答道，"有几个：MAGI 系统和指挥中心，EVA 机体，位于最终教条区的莉莉丝，当然还有亚当。如果敌人发动大规模攻击，这些绝不能落入他们手中，我们不会让他们用肮脏的手夺走一切。所以我要向他们揭示真相，向他们解释一切，" 她指着外面的听众说，然后转向真。"去把我的笔记本电脑和投影仪准备好。"

Makoto nodded. "Will do," he said.  
真点了点头。"好的，" 他说。

---

Now Misato walked onto the stage and stood behind the rostrum. With a video camera trained on her (for live video streaming, just in case if some can't attend the meeting), she then shuffled her notes and tapped on the microphone, which quickly took the attention of her would-be audience, as they were hushed into near silence.  
现在美里走上讲台，站在讲桌后面。一台摄像机对准她（为了实时视频直播，以防有些人无法参加会议），她整理了一下笔记，轻敲麦克风，这迅速吸引了听众的注意，他们逐渐安静下来。

At the same time Makoto was busy setting up the projector at the far end of the auditorium, hooking it up to her laptop before turning both of them on.  
与此同时，真琴正忙着在礼堂的另一端安装投影仪，将其连接到她的笔记本电脑上，然后同时开启两者。

"Good morning, people," Misato spoke aloud, her voice carried over by the PA system. "Today, as you are aware of the situation we're facing right now, I understand that some of you have doubts, fears and feelings of uncertainty, so it leaves me no choice except to explain carefully."  
“大家早上好，”美里通过扩音系统大声说道，“今天，正如你们所知我们目前面临的局势，我理解你们中的一些人可能心存疑虑、恐惧和不确定感，因此我别无选择，只能仔细解释。”

Several people in the audience were loudly asking her what was going on.  
观众中有几个人大声询问她发生了什么事。

"Early this morning," Misato continued, "an Angel attempted to make contact with Lilith, but failed after being neutralized by Unit One, and at the same time, former Commander Ikari was arrested for treasonable acts which could have brought us to catastrophe.  
"“今天清晨，”美里继续说道，“一个使徒试图与莉莉丝接触，但在被初号机消灭后失败了，与此同时，前司令碇源堂因涉嫌叛国行为被捕，这些行为本可能将我们引向灾难。”

"However, about thirty minutes ago, and as most of you have known, the Prime Minister has declared martial law, and also sent us an ultimatum demanding the surrender of this base and the Evas under our possession. As of now, any rights and special protection we have in the name of the United Nations has been rendered null and void, and should we do not comply with their demands, they shall use lethal force with extreme prejudice."  
"“然而，大约三十分钟前，正如你们大多数人所知，首相宣布了戒严令，并向我们发出最后通牒，要求我们交出本基地及所拥有的 EVA。截至目前，我们在联合国名义下享有的任何权利和特殊保护均已失效，如果我们不遵守他们的要求，他们将不惜一切代价使用致命武力。”

Immediately explosions of outrage and disbelief went up in reaction:  
立刻，一阵愤怒和难以置信的爆炸声响起：

"They WHAT?"  
"It can't be! That's not our government!"  
"这不可能！那不是我们的政府！"  
"They can't do this to us!"  
"他们不能这样对我们！"  
"Impossible... Are they mad?"  
"不可能... 他们疯了吗？"

But Misato held up her hand to calm them down.  
但美里举起手来安抚他们。

"Let me finish, ladies and gentlemen," she said. "The government isn't the only party asking for our surrender, for we have the Human Instrumentality Committee to deal with."  
“让我说完，女士们先生们，”她说，“政府并非唯一要求我们投降的一方，因为我们还有人类补完委员会要应对。”

Again, most of her audience wondered what she was talking about.  
再次，她的大多数听众都对她所言感到困惑。

"The Committee, also known as SEELE, our supposed benefactors providing us the money to maintain and operate the Evas, have decided that we're dangerous, expendable and therefore they're preparing to assault this base."  
委员会，即我们所谓的恩人 SEELE，他们提供资金以维持和运营 Eva，现已认定我们危险且可牺牲，正准备攻击本基地。

This time the auditorium exploded in anger and disbelief, forcing Misato to take off one of her shoes and use it as a gavel, repeatedly pounding its heel hard on the rostrum.  
这一次，礼堂内愤怒与不信的声浪爆发，迫使美里脱下一只鞋，将其当作木槌，用力敲击讲台的边缘。

"Listen to me!" Misato pleaded. "I have not come here to give you a really bad scare, but you have to bring your ears to understand what we have to do with this double threat. I'm not joking, I'm not making this crap up, we have the proof of their treachery, the threat is very real and we have to calm down first and put our heads together, so again just listen!"  
“听我说！”美里恳求道，“我来此并非为了吓唬你们，而是要让你们用耳朵去理解我们面对的双重威胁。我不是在开玩笑，也没有编造这些，我们有他们背叛的证据，威胁是真实存在的，我们必须先冷静下来，集思广益，所以请再次认真听我说！”

Now her audience quieted down, which allowed her to sigh for a moment and take a deep breath.  
现在她的听众安静下来，这让她得以叹息片刻，深吸一口气。

"Thank you," Misato said in a calm voice, before continuing. "According to available intelligence, all confirmed by other parties, with the government's A801 order that effectively voids all of our rights, protections and privileges, should we refuse cooperation, either one of these forces will use all means necessary; they will throw anything they have, including N2-tipped missiles, chemical or biological weapons just to capture this base. As if all that isn't enough, SEELE will launch their Evas against ours."  
“谢谢，”美里平静地说道，然后继续，“根据现有情报，所有信息均已得到多方证实，政府 A801 号命令实际上已剥夺了我们所有的权利、保护和特权，如果我们拒绝合作，这些势力将不惜一切手段；他们会动用所有资源，包括 N2 弹头导弹、化学或生物武器，只为夺取这个基地。不仅如此，SEELE 还会派出他们的 Eva 来对抗我们的。”

As Misato had expected, more shocked voices came from her audience as the screen now presented several pictures of the Mass Production Evas, now digitally enhanced for clarity.  
正如美里所预料的那样，当屏幕上展示出经过数字增强清晰度的量产型 Eva 图片时，听众中传来了更多的震惊之声。

"While the _Jietai_ lay siege on this base," she continued, "we believe that, apart from SEELE's private army possibly to be air-dropped, nine of these enemy Evas will be landed by their carriers to attack our Eva units, and each of these invaders are most likely to be powered by S2 Engines and controlled by Dummy Plugs of their own design, and furthermore, they will be armed with false Spears."  
"当自卫队对这座基地进行围攻时，"她继续说道，"我们推测，除了可能空降的 SEELE 私人军队外，敌方九台 Eva 将由其航母运载登陆，攻击我们的 Eva 单位，而这些入侵者极有可能搭载 S2 引擎，并由他们自行设计的模拟插入栓控制，更甚者，它们还将配备伪朗基努斯之枪。"

Murmurs of incredulity came up.  
质疑之声四起。

"With a combination like that, it wouldn't be long before we'll be facing hell, but we still have the fortune of having enough time to prepare ourselves for the worst," Misato spoke, before she gestured to Makoto to bring up the digitized tactical map representing the entire Hakone region, shown on the white screen using a projector connected to her laptop.  
"面对这样的组合，我们很快就会陷入地狱般的境地，但我们仍幸运地有足够时间来为最坏情况做准备，"美里说道，随后示意真希波将整个箱根地区的数字化战术地图通过连接她笔记本电脑的投影仪展示在白色屏幕上。

Arrows and lines intersected the map, marking the paths in red where the JSDF would be taking in their wake of destruction, while blue squares and lines represented NERV strongholds and defense lines.  
箭头与线条交错于地图之上，红色标记着自卫队所经之处留下的破坏路径，而蓝色方块与线条则代表 NERV 的据点与防线。

"The most likelihood for a spearheading attack would be against our communication links coming in and out of this base, any satellites we have currently in orbit, and the MAGI itself, which could be attacked by SEELE hackers, and I can't let out the possibility that elite units would be sent in to neutralize our defenses and communications by stealth. Their electronic warfare aircraft would also flood the whole area with ECM, effectively voiding some of our sensors and radar, and they would follow it up with anti-radiation missiles to destroy or disable them."  
最有可能的先锋攻击目标将是针对进出本基地的通信链路、我们目前在轨的卫星，以及 MAGI 系统本身，可能遭受 SEELE 黑客的攻击。我不能排除他们会派遣精锐部队潜入，以中立化我们的防御和通信。他们的电子战飞机会在整个区域施放电子干扰，有效使我们的一些传感器和雷达失效，随后他们会用反辐射导弹摧毁或瘫痪这些设备。

The projector now displayed the full order of battle, listing the current order of battle of JSDF units pre-positioned at the moment.  
投影仪现在展示了完整的战斗序列，列出了当前预置的自卫队单位的战斗序列。

"Judging from the disposition of their forces," Misato said, "I'm sure that they'll send in at least three or four hard-core armored and infantry divisions through Nagao and Hakone Pass, and blow up the defense lines in Gora and Komatagake, plus several squadrons from Mishima and other airbases to lay down some bombs and missiles, and possible naval bombardment from either Suruga or Sagami Bay. Afterwards, they will send forward the infantry and armored units, destroying anything in their path. With that amount of firepower, it's enough to level everything here to rubble and leave nothing but a howling wilderness."  
"从他们的兵力部署来看，"美里说道，"我确信他们会通过长尾和箱根峠至少派遣三到四个精锐的装甲和步兵师，炸毁御殿场和高天原的防线，再加上三岛和其他空军基地的几个中队进行轰炸和导弹攻击，以及可能来自骏河湾或相模湾的海军炮击。随后，他们会派遣步兵和装甲部队前进，摧毁沿途一切。以这样的火力，足以将这里夷为平地，只留下一片荒凉的废墟。"

Now the audience once again erupted in debate and colorful commentary.  
现在，观众们再次爆发出激烈的辩论和多彩的评论。

"But first," Misato spoke, quieting them down again. "We have to negotiate with the government; we have to explain to them everything, we have to convince them of the dangers that SEELE could do, and release all of that information to the rest of the world by exposing their complicity and their conspiracy to endanger mankind."  
"但首先，"美里开口，再次让他们安静下来。"我们必须与政府谈判；我们必须向他们解释一切，我们必须说服他们 SEELE 可能带来的危险，并通过揭露他们的共谋和阴谋来向全世界公开这些信息，以保护人类免受威胁。"

"You mean we want the government to turn to our side?" one of the men from the audience asked aloud. "Sounds impossible, ma'am."  
"你是说我们希望政府转向我们这边？" 观众中的一位男士大声问道。"听起来不可能，女士。"

"We have the proof that SEELE is responsible for Second Impact," Misato said as she hefted Kaji's steel box onto the rostrum, before whipping out the SD card. "I also have the digital version of these documents in this box, and we will send all of them to every news agency, government and whistleblower on the face of the planet. All of what's inside this box will change their minds, to bring the world to stop their nefarious scheme."  
"我们有证据证明 SEELE 应对第二次冲击负责，" 美里说着将加持的钢盒搬上讲台，然后拿出 SD 卡。"我还有这些文件的数字版在这个盒子里，我们将把这些资料发送给全球每一家新闻机构、政府和举报人。这个盒子里的一切都将改变他们的想法，让世界停止他们的邪恶计划。"

"And where is Commander Ikari?" asked a man in a lab coat, a ranking division chief.  
"碇司令在哪里？" 一位穿着实验室外套的高级部门主管问道。

"I'm sorry to say this, but for those who haven't got the word," Misato said. "Commander Fuyutsuki is now in charge, starting today."  
"我很抱歉这么说，但对于那些还不知道消息的人，" 美里说道，"从今天起，由副司令冬月负责指挥。"

Someone from the audience, a ranking major from the security forces, raised his hand and asked, "So, Colonel, what do you want us to do?"  
观众中有人举手提问，是一名来自安全部队的高级少校，"那么，上校，您希望我们怎么做？"

"Good question," Misato said. "Here's how we should do."  
"问得好，" 美里说，"我们应该这样做。"

---

She began to explain that the defense of the Geofront would involve several tight rings of protection, placing the Pyramid in the center.  
她开始解释，保卫地底都市的防御措施将包括多重严密的保护圈，将金字塔置于中心。

The first line of defense required the blocking of roads, passes and tunnels, using explosives to create landslides or destroy them completely, thus forcing the enemy to find another way in.  
第一道防线要求封锁道路、关口和隧道，使用炸药引发山体滑坡或彻底摧毁它们，从而迫使敌人寻找其他入口。

Next was the protection of the exposed main gate, with heavy weapon emplacements and fortifications; with the other gates obliterated with explosives, and leaving one or two gates intact, this would create a deadly funnel for attackers, as they stumble into the kill zone.  
接下来是保护暴露的主入口，设置重型武器阵地和防御工事；通过炸毁其他入口，仅保留一两个入口，这将形成一个致命的漏斗区，使攻击者陷入死亡地带。

Should the gate defenses could not hold up against the enemy and thus fall and forcing a retreat, the third line would require the construction of a no-man's land, with a clearing two hundred meters wide, an anti-tank ditch, followed by an array of hedgehogs, concertina wire, abandoned vehicles, and debris from the buildings that fell into the Geofront.  
倘若城门防御无法抵挡敌军，导致失守并被迫撤退，第三防线则需构建一片无人区，宽达两百米的空地，随后是反坦克壕沟，接着布满反坦克拒马、蛇腹形铁丝网、废弃车辆以及从地表坠落的建筑残骸。

Near the perimeter of the Pyramid, they will have to position defensive missile and artillery emplacements, the former to protect the complex from air attacks, the latter to shell the enemy. Machine gun nests will have to be created to deal with enemy infantry, with wide fields of fire for which to inhibit their movement.  
在金字塔周边，他们必须部署防御性导弹和炮兵阵地，前者用于抵御空中袭击，后者则用于炮击敌军。机枪掩体也需建立，以应对敌军步兵，确保广阔的火力覆盖范围，限制其行动。

But if this perimeter be breached, they will have to withdraw and turn the labyrinth of the complex into a nightmarish entanglement, with more traps and hidden defensive emplacements to keep the enemy at bay, and if necessary flood and block the occupied corridors with Bakelite.  
但若此防线被突破，他们必须撤退，将复杂的迷宫转变为噩梦般的纠缠，设置更多陷阱和隐蔽防御点以阻敌前进，必要时甚至可用 Bakelite 淹没并封堵已被占领的走廊。

Meanwhile, armed and prepared, the Evas will be launched to deal with the enemy Evas and destroy them immediately, using any available weapons, until none of them should be left standing.  
与此同时，装备齐全、准备就绪的 EVA 将被启动，以应对敌方 EVA 并立即摧毁它们，利用一切可用武器，直到它们无一幸存。

---

"Now if there's so many of them, how could we fight them off?" a young officer asked afterwards.  
“既然有这么多敌人，我们怎么可能击退他们？”一名年轻军官随后问道。

"I propose that anyone with actual combat experience or at least able to pick up a gun and shoot should volunteer," Misato replied. "We need more to help defend this base, as our security forces are insufficient to hold the enemy at bay."  
“我建议任何有实际战斗经验或至少能拿起枪射击的人自愿加入，”美里回答道，“我们需要更多的人来帮助保卫这个基地，因为我们的安全部队不足以阻挡敌人。”

"And what about those who cannot?" another questioned.  
“那么那些无法离开的人呢？”另一个人问道。

"We will try later to negotiate with the government, if they could listen to us, to allow safe passage for noncombatants," she answered. "We cannot afford to put some of our people in harm's way, but should things don't work out well in our favor, the only other option is to evacuate noncombatants down below Central Dogma, at Level 42. That's where the discarded Evas are stored, but it's well-protected and should be easy to defend.  
“我们稍后会尝试与政府谈判，如果他们能听我们的，允许非战斗人员安全通行，”她回答道。“我们不能让一些人置身险境，但如果事情没有朝着我们有利的方向发展，唯一的其他选择就是将非战斗人员疏散到中央教条区下方的第 42 层。那里存放着废弃的 EVA，但保护严密，应该容易防守。”

"Those volunteering to defend the base will be issued with weapons and then be trained as quickly as possible," Misato went on. "SRT units will also be deployed at our most vulnerable spots around the complex. Furthermore, some of you may have any knowledge that we could use to make improvised weapons to supplant the ones we have in limited quantities, so I need volunteers with good experience in creating bombs and jury-rigged arms. Finally, we will have to make do with anything in our inventory to keep this base from being captured."  
“自愿保卫基地的人员将配发武器，并尽快接受训练，”美里继续说道。“特殊作战部队也会部署在我们最脆弱的区域周围。此外，你们中有些人可能拥有我们可以用来制造临时武器的知识，以补充我们有限的武器库存，所以我需要有制作炸弹和临时武器经验的志愿者。最后，我们将不得不利用库存中的任何东西来防止基地被占领。”

Briefly Misato turned to Fuyutsuki, who was standing at the backstage, and noted that the old man looked as if he wanted to say something, so she announced, "The Commander would like to have a few words for all of us, so this would be a great opportunity for him."  
短暂地，美里转向站在后台的冬月，注意到这位老人似乎想说些什么，于是她宣布道：“指挥官希望向我们大家说几句话，这将是他的绝佳机会。”

Without a word Misato walked away from the rostrum, and then Fuyutsuki took over her spot, adjusted the microphone, and cleared his throat.  
美里一言不发地离开了讲台，随后冬月接替了她的位置，调整了麦克风，清了清喉咙。

---

The last time Fuyutsuki confronted a sizeable audience was back when he conducted lectures in the University of Kyoto. Vividly, he remembered one of those times, a day in September and a year before the Impact, standing behind a lectern, his eyes all on his listeners, with half of them preparing to jot down notes, another half almost dozing on their desks, and a small percentage at the back, boys whispering about their girlfriends, last night's drinking session, and of course, some sex on the side.  
上一次冬月面对大量听众还是在京都大学讲课的时候。他清晰地记得其中一次，那是九月的一天，冲击发生前的一年，他站在讲台后，目光扫视着听众，一半的人准备做笔记，另一半则几乎在打瞌睡，后排的少数男生在低声谈论他们的女朋友、昨晚的酒局，当然，还有些风流韵事。

He could also recall the suit he wore then, a gray suit, necktie and polished leather brogues; the lectern before him was filled with notes he had written last night, matters on metabiology he would like to expound and dissect with his pupils' participation.  
他还能记起当时穿的西装，灰色套装，领带和擦得锃亮的皮鞋；讲台前摆满了他昨晚写的笔记，关于元生物学的内容，他希望能与学生们一起阐述和剖析。

For a moment, he flicked his wrist to check on his watch, a stainless-steel Seiko that his parents gave to him as a gift upon receiving the diploma some twenty years ago, before they died in a bus accident five years later.  
有那么一会儿，他轻弹手腕查看手表，那是一块不锈钢的精工表，是他二十多年前毕业时父母送给他的礼物，而他们则在五年后的一场公交车事故中去世了。

The hands on the dial told him it was seven-fifty-five in the morning, and then his eyes darted to the wall clock at the far end of the room, comparing them, and became satisfied with their synchronization.  
表盘上的指针告诉他现在是早上七点五十五分，然后他的目光转向房间另一端的挂钟，对比两者，对它们的同步感到满意。

Just as he was about to speak, Fuyutsuki could sense, rather than hear, the door open. He turned to the left to see Yui Ikari walking in; she was wearing a brown sweater, black skirt and a pair of leather boots.  
正当他准备开口时，冬月能感觉到，而非听到，门被打开了。他转向左边，看到碇唯走了进来；她穿着一件棕色毛衣，黑色裙子和一双皮靴。

"_Good morning, Professor," she said before bowing. "I apologize for being a bit late; got myself caught in traffic."_  
“早上好，教授，”她鞠躬说道，“很抱歉迟到了一点；路上堵车了。”

"_I see," Fuyutsuki replied. "You're just in time, Miss Ikari."_  
“我明白了，”冬月回答，“你来得正好，碇小姐。”

_Relieved, Yui smiled at him. "Thank you, sir."  
感到宽慰的 Yui 向他微笑。“谢谢您，先生。”_

---

Now, more than fifteen years later, Fuyutsuki was once again facing an even larger audience, but this time to address a very urgent crisis not seen in mankind's existence. Thus the speech will have to be brief and direct to the point, simple and easy to understand, yet should be able to galvanize and uplift spirits of those with feelings of despair and doubt.  
如今，时隔十五年有余，Fuyutsuki 再次面对着更为庞大的听众，但这次是为了应对人类历史上前所未有的紧急危机。因此，演讲必须简短直接，简单易懂，同时能够鼓舞人心，振奋那些感到绝望和怀疑的人的精神。

He had to be in the shoes of embattled Churchill, no doubt about it, and so he straightened out, took a deep breath and spoke.  
他无疑必须像身陷困境的丘吉尔那样，于是他挺直了身子，深吸一口气，开始发言。

"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen," he said calmly, like a concerned father talking to his children. "I have a reason to be here right now, by the grave urgency of the problem we're up against.  
“女士们、先生们，早上好，”他平静地说道，宛如一位关切的父亲在向他的孩子们讲话，“我此刻站在这里，是出于我们面临的紧迫问题的迫切需要。”

"First of all, I am a mere teacher then and still a scientist to this day, a man dedicated to pure science, not warfare and destruction; I am never enamored with violence nor wished for it, preferring that I devote my time and effort in the exploration of the unknown and, like all scientists, to pursue and impart knowledge for the benefit of humanity's advancement.  
“首先，我那时只是一名教师，至今仍是科学家，一个致力于纯科学的人，不涉足战争与破坏；我从未迷恋暴力，也不曾希望它发生，更倾向于将我的时间和精力投入到未知领域的探索中，像所有科学家一样，追求并传播知识，以促进人类的进步。”

"But, like a priest whose village is threatened by bandits, I could not stand by as a mute witness worthy of a docile sheep; I could not afford to watch my villagers cower in fear and unable to fight back, as their homes are ransacked and burned, and as their wives and daughters raped and killed before my eyes.  
“但是，就像一个村庄受到土匪威胁的牧师，我不能作为一个沉默的旁观者，像一只温顺的羊那样无动于衷；我无法忍受看着我的村民们在恐惧中瑟瑟发抖，无力反抗，眼睁睁看着他们的家园被洗劫、焚烧，他们的妻子和女儿在我眼前被强奸和杀害。”

"That is a vision that I do not wish to see," Fuyutsuki said, as his eyes surveyed the audience. "I intend that I do not want anyone under my command be needlessly killed for nothing, all the while the Committee prepares the tools to hasten the Human Instrumentality Project, a false hope which brings about the end of our existence as we know it, an abyss which we may not be able to escape from.  
"“那是我不愿目睹的景象，”冬月说道，目光扫视着听众。“我决意不让我的部下因无谓之事白白牺牲，而与此同时，委员会却在准备加速人类补完计划的工具，那是一个虚假的希望，它将带来我们所知存在的终结，一个我们或许无法逃脱的深渊。”

"Instead, like a shepherd endeavoring to protect his flock from wolves with a slingshot and a bag of stones, it gives me no choice except for us, you and I, to take arms and defend ourselves, should the world does not believe in the truth of the Second Impact, the true objectives of Chairman Lorenz and of SEELE, and the penultimate goal of Instrumentality: the destruction of mankind by means of devolution into a single protoplasmic entity.  
"“相反，就像一个牧羊人努力用弹弓和一袋石头保护羊群免受狼群侵害一样，我们别无选择，只能拿起武器自卫，如果世界不相信第二次冲击的真相，不相信洛伦兹主席和 Seele 的真实目标，以及补完计划的终极目标：通过退化成单一原生质实体来毁灭人类。”

"Hence, what they are about to do would be an act of treason on a global scale, declaring war on humanity and life itself, so those who have the courage to stand up and fight to end their scheme once and for all, I am with you, not as the Supreme Commander of NERV, but as a citizen of humanity, a commoner among many; I shall devote every cell of my mind and body for this final battle, should it ever to happen and all peaceful and diplomatic efforts, warning governments of the world with the truth we have to end this madness, do not bring fruit.  
"因此，他们即将采取的行动将是全球范围内的叛国行为，对人类和生命本身宣战，因此那些有勇气站出来并战斗以彻底终结他们阴谋的人，我与你们同在，不是作为 NERV 的最高指挥官，而是作为人类的一员，众多平民中的一员；如果这场最终战役真的到来，所有和平与外交努力，向世界各国政府揭示真相以结束这场疯狂，都未能奏效，我将倾尽我身心中的每一个细胞为之奋斗。

"I understand that the coming hours will be difficult, for we will labor in preparations; if violence erupts, there will also be the possibility of some of us will die, but should we, even I, die trying to stop them from making their plans happen, it would be at least a consolation for our souls, should we ever have the ability to remember, that we have tried our best to defend mankind's existence.  
"我明白接下来的时光将充满挑战，我们将忙于准备；如果暴力爆发，我们中的一些人甚至可能牺牲，但即便我们，甚至是我，在试图阻止他们实施计划的过程中死去，至少我们的灵魂，如果有记忆的能力，会得到一丝慰藉，因为我们已竭尽全力捍卫人类的存在。

"So I hope, just as you do, not for a perfect, sinless world that is wholly pure and yet empty, but rather a world in which we can all live in, with our hearts beating, no matter how much it is stained in sin… and considering that tomorrow will be the birth anniversary of one of the greatest martyrs in history, we will embody hope for the rest of the world, we will bring peace on our terms, we will fight, not against tyranny or persecution, but total extinction.  
"因此，我与你一样，不寄望于一个完美无瑕、纯净却空洞的世界，而是一个我们都能在其中生活，心跳不息的世界，无论它被罪恶玷污得多深……考虑到明天将是一位伟大殉道者的诞辰纪念日，我们将为世界其余部分带来希望，我们将以我们的方式带来和平，我们将战斗，不是对抗暴政或迫害，而是对抗彻底的灭绝。

"If we ever emerge victorious, that will be the finest Christmas gift to the world for us to give! We will move on, we will survive, WE WILL LIVE!"  
"如果我们最终胜利，那将是我们给予世界的最好的圣诞礼物！我们将继续前进，我们将生存，我们将活下去！

Only then Fuyutsuki heaved his chest with great relief, glad that he did the first step in boosting spirits, as the auditorium exploded in cheers, whistles and applause.  
只有那时，冬月才深深地松了一口气，庆幸自己迈出了鼓舞士气的第一步，随着礼堂内爆发出欢呼、口哨和掌声。

---

By the time Fuyutsuki returned to the backstage, he was greeted with more applause, with some clapping their hands on his back, congratulating and thanking him, for there was a leader who promised to stand alongside them. He then had to receive handshakes offered to him, which he profusely accepted; even he felt his spirits upraised, infusing him new energy and will that could sustain him for the hours ahead.  
当冬月回到后台时，迎接他的是更多的掌声，有人拍着他的背，祝贺并感谢他，因为有一位承诺与他们并肩的领导者。接着，他不得不接受伸向他的握手，他热情地回应着；甚至连他自己也感到精神振奋，注入新的能量和意志，足以支撑他度过接下来的时光。

"Sir," Hamamoto said as he shook the new Commander's hand. "That's a great speech you came up with!"  
“先生，”滨本说着，握住了新指挥官的手。“您的演讲真是太精彩了！”

"Thank you, Director," Fuyutsuki said.  
“谢谢您，局长，”冬月说道。

Hamamoto nodded. "You know, sir, I'm not in doubt about you at all; you have now my respect. Let's show the bastards what we can do."  
Hamamoto 点了点头。“您知道，先生，我对您毫不怀疑；您现在赢得了我的尊敬。让我们向那些混蛋展示我们的实力。”

Fuyutsuki chuckled. "That's fine," he replied, before he turned his attention to Misato, who was standing alongside the Children under her command. "Colonel," he said.  
Fuyutsuki 轻笑了一声。“那很好，”他回答道，然后将注意力转向站在她指挥下的孩子们旁边的 Misato。“上校，”他说道。

"Yes, sir?" Misato said.  
“是的，长官？”Misato 说道。

The old man gave her a wistful smile and replied, "You're the woman with the plan, so let's get started right now."  
老人向她投去一个怀旧的微笑，回答道：“你是那位有计划的女性，那我们现在就开始吧。”

Misato saluted at Fuyutsuki. "Yes, sir… and it's a honor for me to serve alongside you," she said.  
美里向冬月敬了个礼。“是的，长官……能与您并肩作战是我的荣幸，”她说道。

Now the old man brought his eyes at Shinji and the rest of the Children, and he said, "As for you, young man…"  
现在，老人将目光转向了真嗣和其他孩子们，他说道：“至于你，年轻人……”

Shinji blinked. "Pardon me, sir?"

"There will be always people like her and me and the rest of us who will stand along with all of you Children," he said before offering an open hand.  
“总会有像她、我以及我们其他人，会一直站在你们这些孩子们身边的，”他说着伸出了手。

"Thank you, sir," Shinji said as they shook hands. "I'll never forget that… and I promise I'll not run away this time."  
“谢谢您，先生，”真嗣握手时说道，“我永远不会忘记这一点……我保证这次不会再逃跑了。”

**Author****'****s****Notes:**Sorry if it's short and I focused mostly on both Misato and Fuyutsuki, but I want to set the tone for things to come, and what they would be expecting. Furthermore and always there are distractions left and right, and thus it took much willpower to concentrate on writing.  
作者**笔记：**抱歉如果篇幅较短，且主要聚焦于美里和冬月，但我希望为接下来的故事定下基调，以及他们将要面对的。此外，总是有各种干扰左右，因此需要极大的意志力来集中精力写作。

Fuyutsuki's speech was inspired by two movie speeches, both from _Independence_ _Day_ and _Armageddon_, as well as those famous wartime speeches in history, especially those of Churchill and Roosevelt, who needed to rouse their nations from shock and terror.  
冬月的话语灵感源自两部电影的演讲，分别来自《独立日》和《世界末日》，以及历史上那些著名的战时演讲，尤其是丘吉尔和罗斯福的演讲，他们需要唤醒国民从震惊和恐惧中振作起来。

More to come, people… and as always, thank you for reading and your faith, they always remind me that there's a fic that needs to be given a proper closure.  
更多内容即将呈现，各位……一如既往地感谢你们的阅读和信任，它们总是提醒我有一篇同人文需要得到圆满的结局。

### Chapter 44 Consensus

_And she was really beat-up this time, dust clouds kicked up around and over her head, as Misato Katsuragi, then a second lieutenant, coughed and wheezed while lying on her back, having been slammed down to the German ground, as trainees in BDUs, ringing around the combatants as spectators, cheered and hollered loudly at her to get up again and try to take a shot again at the opponent.  
这一次她真的被打得很惨，尘土飞扬，环绕在她头顶，而那时还是少尉的葛城美里，躺在德国的土地上，咳嗽着喘息，被重重摔在地上，身着 BDU 训练服的学员们围成一圈，作为观众，大声欢呼着，催促她再次起身，尝试再次向对手发起攻击。_

_Momentarily Misato had a glimpse of blue sky right above her, before snapping her head down for eyes to lock on her opponent, who still stood with his feet almost apart, fists clenched, chest heaving, sweat dripping in rivulets and completely soaking his olive-drab tank-top, his face dirtied, crew-cut hair glistening in the light, and lips forming an arrogant smirk.  
刹那间，美里瞥见了头顶的一抹蓝天，随即猛地低下头，目光锁定对手。对方依旧双脚微分站立，双拳紧握，胸膛起伏，汗水如溪流般滴落，橄榄绿的背心已完全湿透，脸上沾满尘土，短发在阳光下闪闪发亮，嘴角勾起一抹傲慢的笑意。_

_Colonel Miles Quaritch. 迈尔斯·夸里奇上校。_

_True to his word, the old-man sonofabitch was totally unbeatable, despite that Misato held a brown-belt in aikido, a martial art she first learned at_ Todai _(Tokyo-2 University) and then later at the Defense Academy on Miura Island (which broke off the mainland, the rift first splitting through Kamakura and ending at what was left of Yokohama, the island effectively a byproduct of the Second Impact)._  
正如他所言，这个老混蛋确实无人能敌，尽管美里拥有合气道棕带段位，这项武术她最初在东京第二大学（Todai）习得，后来又在三浦岛的国防学院进修（该岛从大陆分离，裂缝首先贯穿镰仓，最终止于残存的横滨，这座岛实际上是第二次冲击的副产品）。

_Momentarily with a probing tongue assessing for battle damage, Misato tasted something coppery in her mouth. Oh, a cut lip or a loose tooth, and she hoped it was the former or she may have to visit the training camp's infirmary the next morning and have the dentist fix it.  
米萨托用探查战损的舌头短暂地品尝了一下，发现嘴里有些铜腥味。哦，可能是嘴唇破了或者牙齿松动了，她希望是前者，否则第二天早上可能得去训练营的医务室让牙医处理一下。_

_But for now she pushed herself upward, to a sitting position, and spat on the dirt, a crimson-tinted saliva stain the size of a coin, before using her left arm to wipe the blood off across the lips.  
但现在，她用力撑起自己，坐了起来，对着泥土吐了一口，留下了一枚硬币大小的深红色唾液污迹，然后用左臂擦去嘴唇上的血迹。_

_Her conscience was in a dilemma, deciding whether she could keep on going or throw the towel right here and now; if she could finish this impromptu smoker match, Misato could be the first woman trainee in this camp to win the prize money, about several thousand Euros chipped in, no strings attached, and what she could do with this hunk of cash?  
她的内心陷入了两难，犹豫着是继续坚持还是就此放弃；如果她能完成这场即兴的烟雾比赛，米萨托将成为这个训练营中第一个赢得奖金的女学员，大约几千欧元，没有任何附加条件，她可以用这笔钱做些什么呢？_

_More genuine German beer at the roadhouse_ bierstube _outside the Global Protection Enterprises training base, of course, and sloshing in real frosted-cold mugs, and make herself and the rest of her class intoxicated than all of Fort Lauderdale's college population during Spring Break, or given her nationality, more than the number of drunken-old-businessmen-with-tie-around-their-heads_ oyaji _in what used to be Roppongi during midnight._  
当然是在全球保护企业训练基地外的公路旅馆啤酒屋里，喝着更正宗的德国啤酒，而且是用真正的冰镇杯子盛着，让她自己和班上的其他人都比春假期间整个劳德代尔堡的大学生还要醉，或者考虑到她的国籍，比过去在六本木午夜时分那些把领带系在头上的醉酒老商人还要多。

"_Still feeling soft, Lieutenant?" Quaritch chided, hard and disapproving eyes staring back at Misato as he smacked his lips. "I could taste that beer, lady."_  
“还觉得软弱吗，中尉？”夸里奇嘲讽道，目光坚硬且不满地盯着美里，同时咂了咂嘴。“我能尝到那啤酒的味道，女士。”

_Misato then heard catcalls and laughter from the watching trainees, as Quaritch flexed and cracked his knuckles.  
随后，美里听到围观学员们的口哨声和笑声，夸里奇则活动着手指，发出噼啪声。_

"Kuso," _she spat out, the native, all-purpose cuss word being the closest thing to_ fuck you, sonofabitch_._  
"该死," 她啐了一口，这个本土的万能咒骂词，是最接近“他妈的，混蛋”的表达。

_In wordless, mocking response and in imitation of the late Bruce Lee by twitching the fingers inwardly on his right hand, Quaritch gestured to Misato to get up on her feet, which she did, dusting herself and flexing the neck sideways, giving out an impression she could go for another round.  
他无声地嘲笑着，模仿已故的李小龙，用右手手指向内抽动，示意美里站起来。美里照做了，拍掉身上的灰尘，扭动脖子，给人一种她还能再战一场的印象。_

_As cheers and hoots erupted around Misato, trainees' boots stomping on the ground, the old warrior nodded in approval.  
当周围的欢呼声和口哨声响起，学员们的靴子跺着地面，老战士点头表示赞许。_

"_Bring it on, Katsuragi," Quaritch dared with a mocking tone in his voice. "You're no more special except to fold some paper and arrange flowers."_  
"来吧，葛城，"夸利奇带着嘲讽的语气挑衅道，"你除了会折纸和插花，也没什么特别的。"

"_Just like I said before when I came here, I don't need special treatment, sir," Misato retorted._  
"就像我之前来这里时说过的，我不需要特殊待遇，长官，"美里反驳道。"

_Quaritch suddenly grinned. "Well, I wonder if the only time you scream and cry is when you're in bed. Is that true?"  
夸利奇突然咧嘴一笑。"那么，我倒想知道你唯一会尖叫和哭泣的时候是不是在床上。是这样吗？"_

_Momentarily Misato's face turned beet-red, as if somehow this man found out her personal life, and now told the world around her she was just as good for sex. This she took as an insult, and without thinking Misato suddenly charged forward at Quaritch, who was ready to give the young woman a fine thrashing.  
一瞬间，美里脸涨得通红，仿佛这个男人不知怎么地发现了她的私生活，现在正向周围的人宣告她同样适合上床。她将此视为侮辱，未经思考，美里突然向夸里奇冲去，而后者已准备好给这个年轻女子一顿痛打。_

_Again._

---

Quaritch opened his eyes, staring back at himself in the mirror, catching his breath as waterdrops slid down on his face, then depositing themselves onto the bottom of the sink. His nose, however, was overwhelmed by the sharp odor of his vomit.  
夸里奇睁开眼睛，盯着镜中的自己，喘着气，水滴从脸上滑落，最终汇入水槽底部。然而，他的鼻子却被呕吐物的刺鼻气味所淹没。

He blinked, and then took a deep breath to recover himself before reaching out to a filled syringe containing the antidote needed to combat the growing pangs of a type 2 cancerous infestation threatening to cut down his system completely.  
他眨了眨眼，深吸一口气以平复心情，随后伸手去拿一支装满解毒剂的注射器，这种解毒剂是用来对抗逐渐加剧的 2 型癌症侵袭，这种侵袭正威胁着要彻底摧毁他的身体系统。

The otherwise healthy and impregnable military man then brought out a thick rubber cord, which he then used to tie his left arm to limit blood circulation, before picking up the syringe, pushing the plunger a little to remove any air bubbles.  
这位原本健康且无懈可击的军人随后取出了一根厚实的橡皮绳，用它将自己的左臂绑紧以限制血液循环，然后拿起注射器，轻轻推动活塞排出空气泡。

Again with a deep breath, Quaritch eyed the invisible target on his left bicep, where the needle should be penetrating the correct blood vessel, then quickly stabbed the syringe in, driving the plunger until it was empty.  
再次深吸一口气，夸里奇盯着左二头肌上那看不见的目标，针头应该准确刺入血管，然后迅速将注射器刺入，推动活塞直至空无一物。

Pulling out the needle, and then covering the injection point with an alcohol-soaked pad using his right hand, Quaritch stood still, letting the antidote course its way through his system, until he could feel the nausea go away. Only then he can breathe easy, taking in more fresh air into his lungs.  
拔出针头，然后用右手用酒精浸湿的棉垫覆盖注射点，夸里奇静静站立，让解毒剂在体内发挥作用，直到他感到恶心感消失。只有那时，他才能轻松呼吸，吸入更多新鲜空气进入肺部。

Now he sorted out the thoughts he had in the few minutes prior to being assaulted by the early symptoms of the fatal disease gnawing into his body, and then the moment he puked into the basin, furious and ashamed of this small moment of weakness, cursing himself for not being able to catch this bug in time.  
此刻，他整理着几分钟前被这致命疾病初现症状侵袭前脑海中的思绪，随后在那一刻对着盆呕吐，既愤怒又羞愧于这短暂的软弱，咒骂自己未能及时捕捉到这个病魔。

And then he wondered… No, he remembered fighting Misato Katsuragi in hand-to-hand combat under the withering German sun, with the dust, salty sweat, the iron odor of blood; the coppery taste of adrenaline and fury, if not fear.  
接着，他思索着……不，他回忆起在德国烈日下与葛城美里近身搏斗的情景，尘土飞扬，汗水咸涩，血的铁锈味；肾上腺素与怒火交织的味道，即便没有恐惧。

"We'll be seeing each other soon enough," Quaritch told himself.  
“我们很快就会再见面的，”夸利奇自言自语道。

Summoned immediately after Fuyutsuki's speech, the division chiefs were walking briskly to the conference room designated for the emergency meeting. Some of them were very skeptical of Misato's findings, but they also wanted more evidence of SEELE's complicity.  
在冬月发表讲话后立即被召集，各部门负责人正快步走向指定用于紧急会议的会议室。他们中的一些人对美里发现的证据非常怀疑，但他们也想要更多关于 SEELE 共谋的证据。

Once they entered the room, Misato was waiting for them, holding Kaji's steel box in hand, and she was staring right into their eyes. Standing to her right was Shinji and Asuka; to her left was Fuyutsuki, Akagi, and Hamamoto, and to the right were Tsutomo and Natsumi.  
一进入房间，美里就等着他们，手里拿着加持的钢盒，直视着他们的眼睛。站在她右边的是真嗣和明日香；左边是冬月、赤木和滨本，右边则是堤和夏美。

Even Paul and Trudy were also present, along with their commanding officer of the air wing, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Billings.  
就连保罗和特鲁迪也在场，与他们的航空队指挥官，中校舍曼·比林斯一同出席。

A tall African-American hailing from Mobile, Alabama, Billings was once a member of the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As a helicopter pilot of that regiment, Billings flew MH-60 Blackhawks and V-22 Ospreys during the Second Korean War, ferrying SEALs and Delta Force operators deep into enemy territory, and sometimes also participated in close-in air support using the Cheyenne gunship. After nearly twenty years of service, the Pentagon recommended him and his expertise to NERV in order to train and take command of that organization's small air wing.  
比林斯来自阿拉巴马州的莫比尔，是一位高大的非裔美国人，曾隶属于精英部队第 160 特种作战航空团（空降）。作为该团的直升机飞行员，比林斯在第二次朝鲜战争期间驾驶 MH-60 黑鹰和 V-22 鱼鹰直升机，深入敌后运送海豹突击队和三角洲部队成员，有时还使用夏延武装直升机参与近距离空中支援。在近二十年的服役后，五角大楼推荐他和他的专业知识到 NERV，以训练并指挥该组织的小型航空队。

But what surprised them was Kaworu Nagisa's presence, standing along with Rei, their hands clasped together.  
但让他们惊讶的是，渚薰也在场，与绫波站在一起，双手紧握。

"What the hell that kid's doing here?" one of the division chiefs loudly demanded, as his fellows stood in hesitation. "He's an Angel, right?"  
"那小子在这里搞什么鬼？" 一位部门主管大声质问，其他人在犹豫中站立。"他是使徒，对吧？"

Misato calmly nodded. "Yes," she said.  
美里平静地点头。"是的，"她说。

"But…?" the skeptical division chief stammered.  
"但是…？" 那位持怀疑态度的部门主管结巴道。

"Is it a problem?" Hamamoto asked as he pulled out a piece of paper and, fully unfurled, flashed it right into the chief's face. "All charges have been dropped, and therefore he's no longer a threat to this organization."  
"这有问题吗？" 浜本问道，他抽出一张纸，完全展开后直接亮在了主任的脸上。"所有指控都已撤销，因此他不再对组织构成威胁。"

"He's really one of us now," Misato clarified. "Don't worry, he has already said sorry to me, and if you need any more convincing, well..."  
"他现在真的是我们中的一员了，" 美里澄清道。"别担心，他已经向我道过歉了，如果你还需要更多说服力，那么..."

And then without batting an eye, Misato upturned the box, pouring its contents over the table, dozens upon dozens of sheets and folders and photos fluttering down, stunning her audience.  
随后，美里毫不犹豫地翻转了盒子，将里面的东西倾倒在桌子上，数十上百的纸张、文件夹和照片纷纷飘落，令在场的人目瞪口呆。

The wide-eyed division chiefs stared at the pile on the table, and back to Misato, who then said, "Let's get started and sort all of this, shall we?"  
几位瞪大眼睛的部门主管盯着桌上的那堆文件，然后转向美里，她随即说道：“我们开始整理这些吧，好吗？”

They looked at each other in the eye, and after a moment faced Misato again and every one of them nodded.  
他们彼此对视一眼，片刻后再次面对美里，每个人都点了点头。

She was right this time, and in overall command.  
这次她是对的，并且总体指挥得当。

Thirty minutes later, the senior division chiefs were flipping through pages, staring at photographs, and whispering quietly about the explosive revelations that the late spy had accumulated throughout his entire career as a triple agent. Their minds were now building up a sufficient picture of SEELE's capacity, clout and its global reach.  
三十分钟后，高级部门负责人翻阅着文件，盯着照片，低声讨论着这位已故间谍作为三重间谍整个职业生涯中积累的爆炸性揭露。他们现在对 SEELE 的能力、影响力及其全球范围有了充分的了解。

Although the table had cigarette ashtrays placed for convenience, for out of respect for the minors present, the habitual smokers reluctantly refrained from pulling out their packs to light up, so they had to weather the pangs of nicotine deprivation for as long as possible and make do with cans of coffee and boxes of nicotine patches.  
尽管桌子上为了方便放置了烟灰缸，但出于对在场未成年人的尊重，习惯吸烟的人不情愿地忍住了掏出烟盒点烟的冲动，因此他们不得不忍受尽可能长时间的尼古丁戒断之苦，只能依靠咖啡罐和尼古丁贴片来应付。

As she watched them examine the files, Misato said, "All of it might not stop SEELE from carrying out their plans, but if we expose them with their pants down, this could give us the advantage we need the most."  
看着他们检查文件，美里说：“这些可能无法阻止 SEELE 执行他们的计划，但如果我们让他们措手不及，这可能会给我们带来最需要的优势。”

Several of the chiefs nodded in agreement.  
几位首领点头表示同意。

"So, what does this leaves us to do?" Hamamoto asked. "Of course, we'll be facing two possible opponents, unless we hope the _Jietai_ do an about-face, which is more of a snowball's chance in hell to me."  
“那么，这让我们该怎么做？”羽本问道，“当然，我们可能会面对两个潜在的对手，除非我们指望自卫队掉头，但那对我来说简直是天方夜谭。”

"All right… Before we begin refining our defense strategy, let's take a look at our assets," Misato said, nodding to Makoto to bring up the following data on the screen:  
“好吧……在我们开始完善防御策略之前，先来看看我们的资源，”美里点头示意诚人将以下数据展示在屏幕上：

"Right now," Misato said, pointing at the list, "This is what all we have, only a mere fraction compared to the guys at our doorstep, and with such a limited size, it's necessary that we have to improvise with whatever we have, creating force multipliers that would give us more time to survive."  
"现在，" 美里指着清单说，"这就是我们所有的，与门口那些家伙相比不过是九牛一毛，而且规模如此有限，我们必须利用手头上的一切资源，创造出能为我们争取更多生存时间的战斗力倍增器。"

Hamamoto, who was sitting rather in a relaxed manner, said, "History has taught us that being ill-prepared for the unexpected, along with lax security, has resulted in grave loss of lives and equipment. As we're the fine line between SEELE's plan for rearranging life as we know it, and salvation of the human race, they'll stop at nothing, unless we give them a bloody nose, which is why I, after this meeting, shall begin a training program to get as many volunteers to beef up our defense."  
坐在相当放松的姿势中的滨本说，"历史告诉我们，对意外准备不足，加上安全松懈，导致了严重的人员和设备损失。作为在 SEELE 重塑我们所知生命计划的细线与人类救赎之间的我们，他们将不择手段，除非我们给他们一个沉重的打击，这就是为什么我，在这次会议之后，将开始一个培训计划，尽可能多地招募志愿者来加强我们的防御。"

"Thank you, Director," Misato said.  
"谢谢你，局长，" 美里说。"

Hamamoto nodded. "No problem, Colonel. It's my business that we should not leave ourselves to chance."  
浜本点了点头。“没问题，上校。我们不应该把命运交给偶然，这是我的职责。”

Misato's gaze wandered around the table. "Okay, what else do we have?"  
美里环视了一下桌子。“好吧，我们还有什么？”

Colonel Billings raised a hand.  
比林斯上校举起一只手。

"Yes, sir?"

Billings cleared his throat. "If you're wondering what's up with my division, except for the one Cheyenne we lost days ago to ground fire, the entire gunship fleet is otherwise in pretty good shape, at 90% availability. Our transports also have the same nice figures, thanks to our mechanics, spending enough time to maintain them almost like new." He then proudly produced a grin.  
比林斯清了清嗓子。“如果你想知道我的部门状况如何，除了几天前被地面火力击落的那架夏延直升机外，整个武装直升机舰队其他部分都保持得相当不错，可用率达到了 90%。我们的运输机也同样有着良好的数据，这要归功于我们的机械师，他们投入了足够的时间来维护，几乎让它们焕然一新。” 他随后自豪地露出了笑容。

"Great, but what about the munitions?" Misato asked.  
“很好，但弹药情况如何？”美里问道。

"Very ample," Billings said. "We still have 368 pieces of Hellfires, 52 sets of Hydras, and some twelve thousand 20mm rounds for the guns. All that is still enough to give enemy armor some thought, unless they start firing portable SAMs at us."  
“非常充足，”比林斯说。“我们还有 368 枚地狱火导弹，52 组九头蛇火箭弹，以及大约一万两千发 20 毫米炮弹。所有这些都足以让敌方的装甲部队有所顾忌，除非他们开始向我们发射便携式防空导弹。”

"You have countermeasures?"  
"你有对策吗？"

"We've covered that already two days ago, retrofitting the gunships with emission control packages and more flare and chaff projectors."  
"两天前我们已经讨论过了，给炮艇加装了排放控制系统，还增加了更多的干扰弹和箔条发射器。"

Misato smiled. "Very impressive. Anything else, ladies and gentlemen?"  
美里笑了。"非常出色。还有其他建议吗，女士们先生们？"

"I've made up a task list for the medical division," Natsumi said, rising from her seat. "My people will begin setting up field triage facilities for convenience and immediate access, but we'll also try our best to stockpile the medicines, equipment and supplies needed to meet casualty projections."  
"我已经为医疗部门制定了一份任务清单，" 夏美站起身来说道。"我们的人员将开始设置便于快速访问的野外急救设施，但同时我们也会尽力储备所需药品、设备和物资，以应对伤亡预测。"

"Has the MAGI computed that figure?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
"MAGI 计算过这个数字吗？" 冬月问道。"

"Yes, and done that, sir, while everyone else were checking out those papers here," Natsumi said. "Given the odds, I'd say the figures could approach 70 percent, maybe even more."  
"是的，先生，在其他人检查这些文件的时候，MAGI 已经完成了计算，" 夏美回答。"考虑到概率，我认为这个数字可能会接近 70%，甚至更高。"

Almost everyone in the room groaned.  
房间里几乎每个人都发出了呻吟声。

"But we can try to bring that figure down further, as I'm assigning some of my people with military experience to work as medics in the field. They'll have to work alongside with the perimeter troops, and of course, should be able to shoot."  
“但我们还可以进一步降低这个数字，我安排了一些有军事经验的人员作为战地医疗兵。他们需要与外围部队协同工作，当然，也应该具备射击能力。”

"I see," Fuyutsuki nodded. "It is very understandable that your division will be important should the balloon goes up."  
“我明白了，”冬月点头道，“如果局势升级，你的部门将显得尤为重要。”

"Thank you, sir." Natsumi then sat down.  
"谢谢您，先生。" 夏美随后坐了下来。

A division chief on the left side of the table raised his hand, having put down his phone first. Misato read off his nameplate: Hanamura; this man was responsible for his division, which operated and maintained the perimeter defense batteries emplaced throughout the Hakone area of operations.  
坐在桌子左侧的一位部门主管首先放下手机，举起了手。美里读着他的名牌：花村；这位负责人负责管理他的部门，该部门负责操作和维护部署在箱根地区作战范围内的周边防御电池。

"Yes, Mister Hanamura?"

"I have personally instructed my men to get some of our best weapons off the defense lines, as many as they can bring in," Hanamura said. "That includes several heavy-caliber autocannons and missile launchers. Sure, they'll just bounce off an Angel like peas, but still more than enough to eat through tank armor, as the rounds are tipped with depleted uranium or tungsten."  
"我已经亲自指示我的部下从防御线上撤下我们最好的武器，能带多少就带多少，" 花村说。"这包括几门大口径自动炮和导弹发射器。当然，这些对使徒来说就像豌豆一样弹开，但仍然足以穿透坦克装甲，因为炮弹是铀或钨制成的。"

"They're doing it right now?"  
“他们现在就在做这件事？”

Hanamura nodded. "Yes, at this moment, Colonel, but do you have anything more on the opposition? I'd like to know what they could dish out on us."  
花村点了点头。“是的，就在此刻，上校，但您有没有更多关于对方的信息？我想知道他们能对我们造成什么威胁。”

Obliging Hanamura, Misato then nodded to Makoto, who then brought up the JSDF and the GPE/SEELE order of battle on the projection screen, before they began discussing about their potential adversaries.  
遵从花村的请求，美里随后向真希特点头示意，真希便将自卫队和 GPE/SEELE 的作战序列投射到屏幕上，随后他们开始讨论可能的对手。

The Strategic Self-Defense Force, but still referred to as _Jietai_, was borne out of the decision to amend Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, an American-drafted document which once put the military on a pacifist leash since World War Two, and in the wake of the destruction wrought by the Second Korean War.  
战略自卫队，仍被称为自卫队，源于修订日本宪法第九条的决定，这部由美国起草的文件曾在二战后将军事力量置于和平主义的约束之下，并在第二次朝鲜战争造成的破坏之后应运而生。

Therefore, the _Jietai_ was no longer a heavily-armed "national police force" but a true standing army in the essence of the word, with personnel numbering more than half a million strong, some of them active duty, some others serving as reservists.  
因此，自卫队不再是装备精良的“国家警察部队”，而是一支名副其实的常备军，人员总数超过五十万，其中一部分是现役军人，另一部分则是预备役。

Since then, the _Jietai_, by leaps and bounds developed its own domestic arsenal, which in the beginning consisted mostly of license-produced copies of foreign weapon platforms, until it had one of the most powerful militaries in East Asia, second only to China yet comparable to Israel's highly-trained Defense Forces.  
自那时起，自卫队迅速发展了自己的国产武器库，起初主要是外国武器平台的许可生产复制品，直到它成为东亚最强大的军事力量之一，仅次于中国，但可与训练有素的以色列国防军相媲美。

With Article 9 now revised without the pacifist provision in the 2004 Constitution, the _Jietai_ was authorized, by parliamentary approval, to be deployed overseas in support of the United Nations, and if necessary provide active combat support to its allies. Despite some handful of lives lost in combat (and outrage from left-leaning and pacifist groups), the _Jietai_ acquired credible military experience not seen since World War Two, and this experience was then applied to their training regimen, especially on live-fire exercises at the barren land north of what was once Tokyo.  
随着 2004 年宪法中和平条款的修订，《第九条》现已不再包含和平主义内容，自卫队经国会批准，被授权部署海外以支持联合国，并在必要时为其盟友提供积极的战斗支援。尽管在战斗中有少数生命损失（并引发了左翼和和平主义团体的强烈抗议），自卫队获得了自二战以来未曾见过的可信军事经验，这些经验随后被应用于他们的训练计划中，特别是在曾经是东京北部的荒凉土地上进行的实弹演习。

Their navy now possessed guided missile cruisers with firepower greater than the ill-fated imperial battleships _Yamato_ and _Musashi_; the army was equipped with heavy main battle tanks and attack helicopters; and the air force was sending aloft home-built stealth fighters on par with the F-22 Raptor, armed with long-range missiles.  
他们的海军现在拥有火力超过不幸的帝国战舰大和号和武藏号的导弹巡洋舰；陆军配备了重型主战坦克和攻击直升机；而空军则将国产隐形战斗机送上天空，这些战斗机与 F-22 猛禽不相上下，装备有远程导弹。

But the _Jietai_, of course, had a dozen Non-Nuclear (N2) modular tactical weapons with a yield of up to three kilotons each, and they have used one before on the very first Angel assault (which didn't work but nonetheless the first detonation of a weapon of mass destruction on Japanese soil since Nagasaki).  
但自卫队当然拥有十几种非核（N2）模块化战术武器，每种武器的威力高达三千吨，并且在第一次使徒攻击时就曾使用过一枚（虽然效果不佳，但这仍是自广岛核爆以来日本本土首次使用大规模杀伤性武器）。

The GPE, according to _Jane's All the World's Private Military Companies_, held the largest privately-held military force outside of any government. Founded in 1995, it has around 5,000 personnel, with more than half of them former servicemen of elite military forces, all under the current command of Colonel Miles Quaritch, once an officer in the elite Delta Force (US Army Special Forces Operational Detachment Delta).  
根据《简氏全球私人军事公司》，GPE 拥有全球最大的非政府私人军事力量。成立于 1995 年，拥有约 5000 名人员，其中超过半数为前精英部队军人，目前由曾任美军精锐三角洲部队（美国陆军特种作战分遣队 Delta）军官的迈尔斯·奎尔蒂上校指挥。

Thanks to its connections to defense corporations, seeking interested parties to test their equipment, this company also had its own small navy (including missile boats armed with guided anti-ship Exocets), a small air force (consisting of MIG-29s, Sukhoi Su-27 Flankers, Israeli Kfirs, helicopter transports and attack gunships, notably the C-21 Dragon heavy gunship), and an armored battalion, with battle tanks, APCs and Amplified Mobility Platforms (called AMP suits, enabling a trooper to carry very powerful weaponry and other huge loads in a combat environment under all conditions).  
得益于与国防企业的联系，寻求有意向的各方测试其装备，该公司还拥有自己的小型海军（包括配备有制导反舰飞鱼导弹的导弹艇），一支小型空军（由米格-29、苏霍伊苏-27 侧卫、以色列幼狮、直升机运输和攻击直升机组成，特别是 C-21 龙重型攻击直升机），以及一个装甲营，配备有主战坦克、装甲运兵车和增强机动平台（称为 AMP 套装，使士兵能够在各种条件下携带强大的武器和其他重型装备在战斗环境中）。

Publicly, the GPE is noted in providing security for large multinational businesses and diplomatic posts operating in dangerous countries, as well as training the militaries of smaller nations. But for an extra cost, the GPE also covertly employs its forces in offensive operations at the request of their wealthy customers, including industrial espionage, assassination, kidnapping, smuggling, and sabotage.  
公开而言，GPE 以向在危险国家运营的大型跨国企业和外交机构提供安全保障而著称，同时也为较小国家的军队提供训练。但额外付费的话，GPE 还会根据其富有客户的请求，秘密部署其部队执行进攻性行动，包括工业间谍、暗杀、绑架、走私和破坏活动。

Nevertheless, with Kaji's dossiers revealing its connections, GPE's main loyalty lay with SEELE, and therefore will be more than capable of carrying out Lorenz's mandate by brimstone and fire.  
尽管如此，随着卡吉的档案揭示其联系，GPE 的主要忠诚归于 SEELE，因此完全有能力通过硫磺与火来执行洛伦兹的命令。

After the review, Hanamura shook his head in disbelief, and said, "Seems that the world is against us, eh?"  
审查结束后，花村摇着头难以置信地说：“看来这世界是跟我们作对啊，嗯？”

"Not necessarily," Misato replied, setting aside the folder that she was reading.  
“未必，”美里回答，放下手中正在阅读的文件夹。

"How so?" Hananura doubted.  
“此话怎讲？”花村疑惑道。

Fuyutsuki stood up and answered, "We have to send everything we know to the rest of the world, tell them what's really going on here, so excuse me, Mister Hyuga."  
冬月站起身来回答道：“我们必须将所知的一切传递给世界其他地方，告诉他们这里真正发生的事情，所以请原谅，碇先生。”

Makoto looked up, his eyes taken away from Misato's laptop, which he was using to monitor the newsfeeds around the globe.  
真嗣抬起头，目光从美里小姐的笔记本电脑上移开，他正用它来监控全球的新闻动态。

"Yes, sir?" he asked.  
“是，长官？”他问道。

"What's the current situation going on around us?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
"我们周围目前的情况如何？" 冬月问道。

The junior officer used his finger to scroll down to read off items of interest.  
年轻的军官用手指滑动屏幕，逐一阅读感兴趣的项目。

"I've just found out that the Pacific fleet of the Russian navy had set sail for their annual winter exercises, supposedly a hundred or so kilometers away from Vladivostok," he said. "Or so their PR claims, but that can be of grave concern for us."  
"我刚刚得知，俄罗斯海军的太平洋舰队已经出海进行年度冬季演习，据称距离符拉迪沃斯托克大约一百公里，" 他说。"尽管这是他们公关的说法，但这对我们来说可能是个严重的问题。"

In reaction Fuyutsuki's forehead furrowed. "Go on," he said.  
听到这话，冬月皱起了眉头。“继续说，”他说。

"Coincidentally," Makoto continued, "The Russian air force is also conducting extensive joint exercises with the Chinese, in Manchuria. They're running the usual lessons: close-in air support, bomber interception, air-to-air combat, and suppression of air defenses… and oh, another thing about the Committee members, sir."  
“巧的是，”真琴继续说道，“俄罗斯空军也在满洲与中国进行大规模联合演习。他们正在进行常规训练：近距离空中支援、轰炸机拦截、空对空作战以及防空压制……哦，还有关于委员会成员的另一件事，长官。”

"Pardon me?"

Makoto cleared his throat. "We have at least one very high-profile report about this Evgenyi Starayakov, who happens to be the head of the Russian petroleum consortium. His PR rep said he's taking a leave of absence due to medical reasons. He's not the only one getting off the grid, as several more of these fogeys are making excuses."  
真琴清了清嗓子。“我们至少有一份关于这个叶甫根尼·斯塔拉亚科夫的高调报告，他恰好是俄罗斯石油集团的负责人。他的公关代表称，他因健康原因正在休假。他并非唯一一个脱离视线的人，还有几位老前辈也在找借口。”

"Not good," Fuyutsuki remarked. "What about elsewhere? How the Americans, the Chinese and the Europeans are reacting to this?"  
"不妙，" 冬月评论道。"其他地方呢？美国人、中国人和欧洲人对这件事有何反应？"

"Good thing you asked about it, sir," Makoto replied. "In the last three hours, our reconsats have picked up very high levels of communication traffic between their defense satellites, with some possibly making orbital adjustments to make passes right over us. There's some voice traffic too, with their ships at sea and at diplomatic outposts. But we haven't mentioned about our branches."  
"幸好您问了，先生，" 真希回答。"过去三个小时里，我们的侦察卫星监测到他们防御卫星间的通讯流量异常高，其中一些可能正在进行轨道调整，以便直接飞越我们上空。还有些语音通讯，涉及他们在海上和外交机构的船只。但我们还没提到我们的分支机构。"

"Oh, I forgot them," Fuyutsuki said. "What are they doing right now?"  
"哦，我忘了他们，" 冬月说。"他们现在在做什么？"

Makoto shook his head. "I'm sorry sir, we've repeatedly tried to contact them, but still no responses. Nothing from Cambridge, Frankfurt, or even Matsushiro, as if… they don't exist at all."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“对不起，先生，我们多次尝试联系他们，但至今没有回应。无论是剑桥、法兰克福，还是松代，都杳无音讯，仿佛……他们根本不存在一样。”

The chiefs grumbled in disappointment and anger.  
首领们失望且愤怒地咕哝着。

Fuyutsuki sighed. "With their complicity in the development of the S2 Engine and the Dummy Plug," he said, "both finished without our knowledge, I'm not surprised, as they've even turned our branches against us."  
冬月叹了口气。“他们在 S2 引擎和傀儡系统的开发中都有所参与，”他说，“这两项都是在我们的不知情下完成的，我并不惊讶，因为他们甚至让我们的分支机构与我们作对。”

"That's right, sir," Misato grimly agreed. "We're on our own now."  
"没错，先生，" 美里严肃地同意道，"我们现在只能靠自己了。"

The old man took a moment to gaze his eyes on the chiefs and subordinates, and then spoke.  
老人稍作停顿，目光扫过各位长官和下属，随后开口说道。

"Does anyone wishes us first to negotiate with the Prime Minister?" he asked, implying that he wanted an informal vote on the matter. Fuyutsuki turned to Misato, and added, "We have good reason why we should."  
"有人希望我们先与首相谈判吗？" 他问道，暗示他想就此问题进行非正式投票。冬月转向美里，补充道，"我们有充分的理由应该这么做。"

Misato nodded, then took out the SD card from her pocket and eyed it for a moment.  
美里点点头，然后从口袋里拿出 SD 卡，盯着它看了一会儿。

"He's right, we have to scare the hell out of the Prime Minister," she said. "Now, anyone who knows this guy, he's a lame duck in most cases, he's still taking heat from all sides since the last election, faltering on his promises, and worse, especially that little affair he had with some AV star."  
“他说得对，我们得把首相吓个半死，”她说道，“现在，任何了解这家伙的人都知道，他大多数情况下都是个跛脚鸭，自上次选举以来一直四面受敌，承诺摇摆不定，更糟糕的是，尤其是他和某位 AV 女星的那点小插曲。”

Almost everyone in the room gave out chuckles, breaking the tense mood that permeated the air since the start of the meeting. The whole country knew of the Prime Minister's public gaffe, which nearly forced him to resign.  
房间里几乎每个人都发出了轻笑声，打破了会议开始以来弥漫在空气中的紧张气氛。整个国家都知道首相那次公开的失态，差点迫使他辞职。

"The Chairman may boast that he has everything in his pockets," Misato said. "But in reality not all will agree to his wishes, for men have their own minds and can decide on the basis of their strengths and weaknesses. Some, like the Prime Minister, are sitting on the fence, seeing who would have the upper hand, and naturally they will go to the winning side with the most advantages.  
"“主席或许会夸口他掌控一切，”美里说道，“但实际上并非所有人都顺从他的意愿，因为每个人都有自己的思想，能根据自己的强弱做出决定。有些人，比如首相，正观望哪一方能占上风，自然他们会选择最有利的一方站队。”

"Now, I'm not saying that we can win easily, but our fates – and ultimately, of humanity – depends on who would join or fight us, and the leaders of the world have their reputations on the line, dependent on the people they serve.  
"“现在，我并不是说我们能轻易取胜，但我们的命运——以及最终，人类的命运——取决于谁会加入或对抗我们，世界各国的领导人也背负着他们所服务人民的声誉。”

"As our forces are limited in experience, size and firepower, and even with the Evas as our trump cards, if we do not succeed in winning the hearts and minds of those politicians, it will be the end of everything we fight for, and the victory we want will be snatched completely in the Chairman's favor.  
"“尽管我们的力量在经验、规模和火力上都有限，即便有 EVA 作为我们的王牌，如果我们不能赢得那些政客的心，那么我们所奋斗的一切都将终结，我们渴望的胜利也将完全落入主席的囊中。”

"However, try as he might to proclaim he is the most powerful man on Earth, and hence confident in the power of his Evas, munitions and minions, Chairman Lorenz still has his own doubts eating at his will, impatient and hungry, blinded by his own power and avarice, and I'm pretty sure he's looking at us, thinking, scheming, trying to come up ways to destroy us several times over, and he fears losing the opportunity to remake the world as he sees fit. Furthermore, there will be many factors that are beyond his control, just like Kaworu right here."  
"然而，尽管他竭力宣称自己是地球上最有权势的人，因此对他的 Eva、军火和手下充满信心，洛伦兹主席内心仍被疑虑啃噬，急躁而贪婪，被自己的权力和贪欲蒙蔽，我敢肯定他正盯着我们，思考着，策划着，试图想出多次摧毁我们的方法，他害怕失去按照自己意愿重塑世界的机会。此外，还有许多因素是他无法控制的，就像这里的渚薰一样。"

Kaworu nodded in acknowledgement.  
渚薰点头表示认同。

"But if we could have the rest of the world on our side, and with a little luck if we play our cards right," Misato continued, "and win and survive this altogether, I'm really sure a new age will dawn upon mankind."  
"但如果我们能让世界其他地方站在我们这边，并且如果我们策略得当，再加上一点运气，" 美里继续说道，"并且赢得这场战斗并幸存下来，我真的相信人类将迎来一个新的时代。"

"And soon you'll become a schoolteacher, neh?" Tsutomo quipped, recalling their earlier conversation that was interrupted by the roadside ambush.  
"很快你就要成为一名教师了，对吧？" 筒友打趣道，回想起之前被路边伏击打断的那场对话。

Misato grinned as others laughed lightly. "Make no mistake, Tomo, I'll be there," she said before nodding at Fuyutsuki, who then cleared his throat.  
美里咧嘴一笑，其他人也轻声笑了起来。"别搞错了，Tomo，我会在那里的，"她说完向冬月点了点头，冬月随即清了清嗓子。

"Those who agree, you may raise your hands," Fuyutsuki finally said. "If we have to survive longer, let's put a lot of pressure on the world's governments, especially the Prime Minister and many others like him."  
"同意的人可以举手，"冬月终于说道。"如果我们必须生存得更久，那就给世界各国政府，尤其是首相和他那样的许多人施加巨大压力。"

Without hesitation, everyone, including the chiefs, showed their hands up, and Misato counted them, before she faced Fuyutsuki and nodded.  
没有犹豫，包括指挥官在内的所有人都举起了手，Misato 数了数，然后面对 Fuyutsuki 点了点头。

There was now an unanimous agreement: everyone said "yes".  
现在达成了一致意见：每个人都说了“是”。

Misato then turned to Makoto, who was still perusing her laptop, connected to the Internet, to monitor the news feeds and the current status of the entire base.  
随后，Misato 转向 Makoto，她仍在浏览她的笔记本电脑，连接到互联网，监控新闻动态和整个基地的当前状态。

"Let's upload all of this to Wikipee," she said, "email it all to every news agency on the planet, fax it out to anywhere from the Kremlin to the White House. Spam the globe with it, no questions asked, no holds barred."  
"我们把这些都上传到 Wikipee 吧，"她说，"给全球所有新闻机构都发一遍邮件，从克里姆林宫到白宫，哪里都传真过去。不问缘由，不设限制，让这些信息遍布全球。"

Makoto nodded. "Sure, the lines are still open," he said. "Except for the MAGI-specific network protocols, which have been locked down for the duration."  
真点点头。"当然，线路还是通的，"他说，"除了 MAGI 专用的网络协议，那些已经被封锁了。"

She then gave the SD card to him, placing it squarely into his open palm.  
她随后将 SD 卡递给他，稳稳地放在他摊开的手掌中。

"I want you to set the world on fire," Misato said, not knowing that they were almost the same words that St. Ignatius of Loyola once proclaimed hundreds of years ago.  
“我要你点燃这个世界，”美里说道，却不知这几乎与数百年前圣依纳爵·罗耀拉所宣称的如出一辙。

With a mere nod Makoto slipped the memory card into the reader slot, and began to work.  
仅仅一个点头，真嗣便将记忆卡滑入读卡槽，开始操作。

For its data and voice communication needs on a daily basis, NERV Main Headquarters Japan was exclusively serviced with six dedicated 38-gigabit OC-768 SONET fiber-optic lines provided jointly by NTT and KDDI, enabling the organization to send and receive massive amounts of data in terabytes, mostly between the MAGI supercomputers installed in every major NERV base, using the proprietary and heavily-encrypted MAGI-TCP/IP protocol, personally developed and deployed by the late Doctor Naoko Akagi.  
为了日常的数据和语音通信需求，NERV 日本总部专门配备了由 NTT 和 KDDI 共同提供的六条 38 吉比特 OC-768 SONET 光纤线路，使得该组织能够以太字节为单位发送和接收大量数据，主要在各主要 NERV 基地安装的 MAGI 超级计算机之间进行，使用已故博士赤木直子亲自开发并部署的专有且高度加密的 MAGI-TCP/IP 协议。

A portion of this monster bandwidth, a 1-Gbit block, was devoted for standard TCP/IP networking, which was just as heavily secured by a triple firewall, a proxy, a DMZ, and a black-hole filter, all of it also created by Akagi to meet and exceed existing security standards, allowing smaller computers and associated networks to access the Internet safely at very high speeds.  
其中一部分怪兽级带宽，即 1 吉比特的区块，专用于标准 TCP/IP 网络，同样通过三重防火墙、代理、DMZ 和黑洞过滤器进行了严密保护，这一切均由赤木创造，旨在满足并超越现有安全标准，使小型计算机及相关网络能够以极高速度安全接入互联网。

To augment the existing fiber-optic connections, especially during emergencies should the hardened mainlines are rendered inoperable or destroyed, NERV had its own satellite communications network, called NERVSTAR, with four satellites covering every quarter of the planet in geosynchronous orbit (at 35,786 km above the surface of the Earth). To use this other network, an aboveground satellite dish farm was installed on top of one of the Hakone peaks, linked to HQ via fiber-optic link.  
为了增强现有光纤连接，特别是在紧急情况下，当加固的主干线失效或被摧毁时，NERV 拥有自己的卫星通信网络，名为 NERVSTAR，由四颗覆盖地球各四分之一区域的同步轨道卫星组成（距地表 35,786 公里）。为了使用这一备用网络，在箱根山峰之一上安装了地面卫星天线阵列，通过光纤链路与总部相连。

With Maya and Shigeru assisting him, in a few minutes Makoto had organized and compressed all of Kaji's files into a single ZIP 4 gigabytes in size, roughly the same size of a DVD, then opened up an email program that he would then compose a message and attach the ZIP file.  
在真夜和四郎的协助下，几分钟内，真琴便将所有加持的文件整理并压缩成一个 4GB 大小的 ZIP 文件，大致相当于一张 DVD 的容量，随后打开电子邮件程序，准备撰写邮件并附加该 ZIP 文件。

Using a bot program which collected all the email addresses of every major government and agency in the world, as well as several more belonging to many news agencies and known whistleblowers, and compiled them into a list, Makoto pasted the list into the "To" field, and typed the following message:  
利用一个机器人程序，该程序收集了全球所有主要政府和机构的电子邮件地址，以及许多属于新闻机构和知名举报人的额外地址，并将它们编译成一个列表，真嗣将该列表粘贴到“收件人”字段中，并键入了以下消息：

---

_My name is Lieutenant Makoto Hyuga, a staff officer belonging to the Special Agency NERV, General Headquarters Japan, and on behalf of Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki, who has authorized this course of action, I have sent this message to you with the utmost urgency.  
我的名字是真嗣·日向，隶属于日本总部特别机构 NERV 的参谋军官，代表已授权此行动的指挥官富士见耕造，我以最紧急的方式向您发送此消息。_

_To anyone who receives this message, what you will have is a file containing all information concerning the Second Impact and the organization responsible for its occurrence. Although the original source and compiler of this information is now dead, murdered in cold blood, the contents of this file can still be confirmed for authenticity against existing documentation, including those in the public domain, or considered incriminating and therefore highly classified and kept secret from the public.  
任何收到此消息的人，您将获得一个包含有关第二次冲击及其责任组织所有信息的文件。尽管此信息的原始来源和编译者现已遇害，惨遭冷血谋杀，但该文件的内容仍可通过现有文件进行真实性验证，包括公开领域的文件，或被视为具有指控性因此高度机密并对外保密。_

_Anyone who possesses this information must disseminate it as quickly as possible, for the world to know that the secret organization known as SEELE, through its armed forces by proxy, would soon assault this base and possibly kill all of its personnel and take possession of the Evangelions for their illicit use, to initiate a Third Impact that could possibly spell the end of mankind as we know it, with more destruction than Second Impact.  
任何掌握此信息的人都必须尽快传播，让世界知晓那个名为 SEELE 的秘密组织，通过其代理武装力量，即将袭击此基地，并可能杀害所有人员，夺取用于非法目的的 EVA，以引发可能意味着我们所知人类末日的第三次冲击，其破坏力将远超第二次冲击。_

_To those in higher office, may we hope that with this information you could act decisively to help us stop SEELE from trying to seize control of this base, for in your hands is the fate of humanity.  
致高层人士，愿我们能寄希望于您，凭借此信息果断行动，助我们阻止 SEELE 试图控制此基地的企图，因为人类的命运正掌握在您的手中。_

_Only the truth can save us now.  
唯有真相能拯救我们于此刻。_

---

Makoto turned to Fuyutsuki and Misato, who were watching him compose the message for the last few minutes, and for approval he asked, "What do you think?"  
真嗣转向冬月和美里，他们正注视着他撰写这条信息已有几分钟了，为了得到他们的认可，他问道：“你们觉得怎么样？”

"Very good," Fuyutsuki said after scanning the finished message. "That will give them a very rude awakening, so send it."  
“非常好，”冬月在浏览完信息后说道，“这将让他们大吃一惊，发送吧。”

"Yes sir," Makoto answered, and with his hand guiding the mouse, he clicked on the SEND button.  
“是，长官，”真嗣回答道，在他的手引导下，鼠标点击了发送按钮。

The message, with its voluminous attachment, left the room at near the speed of light, to the main datacenter, where, with its email server, quickly replicated the message into several copies, before the gigabit router shook hands with the SONET router and fired away thousands of data packets into the dedicated trunk line leading out into the world, connected to a NTT exchange building located in Odawara City.  
这条附带大量附件的信息以接近光速离开房间，抵达主数据中心。在那里，通过电子邮件服务器迅速复制成多份，随后千兆路由器与 SONET 路由器握手，将成千上万的数据包发射到通往世界的专用干线，连接至位于小田原市的 NTT 交换大楼。

From there the email spread out to other outlying networks across Japan, and to undersea fiber-optic cables connecting Odawara to neighboring stations in San Francisco, Melbourne, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the signal boosted and carried over by cable repeaters separated for more than 100 kilometers between each other.  
从那里，电子邮件扩散至日本其他外围网络，并通过连接小田原与旧金山、墨尔本、首尔、香港和新加坡邻近站点的海底光缆，信号由间隔超过 100 公里的电缆中继器增强并传输。

In less than 45 seconds, the email reached the other side of the world, copies dropped into every inbox, awaiting the recipient to open and read it, not expecting its contents to be shockingly capable of changing the course of history.  
不到 45 秒，电子邮件便横跨世界，副本落入每个收件箱，等待收件人打开阅读，未曾预料其内容竟有惊人能力改变历史进程。

---

The email program installed in Misato's laptop now told Makoto that the transmission was complete. He then read off the time on his watch, implying to his superiors that a little patience will be needed.  
安装在 Misato 笔记本电脑上的电子邮件程序现在告诉 Makoto 传输已经完成。他随即看了一眼手表上的时间，向他的上级暗示需要一点耐心。

"In a few minutes, we'll get our answer," he said.  
“几分钟后，我们就会得到答案，”他说。

From that point nobody inside the conference room spoke a word, anxiously awaiting for the inevitable reply, some of them silently envisioning how the Prime Minister would react, such as spitting out his coffee upon opening and reading the attachment.  
从那一刻起，会议室内的每个人都一言不发，焦急地等待着不可避免的回复，有些人默默地想象着首相打开并阅读附件时的反应，比如可能会在看到内容时喷出咖啡。

After several minutes, Makoto said as he peered at the screen, "We have an incoming transmission. It's him, all right."  
几分钟后，真琴盯着屏幕说道，“我们收到了一条传入通讯。没错，是他。”

"Bring it up on the main display," Fuyutsuki ordered.  
“把它显示在主屏幕上，”冬月命令道。

The Prime Minister appeared onscreen, as he chose to speak via videoconferencing, introducing himself to those present, and nodded.  
首相出现在屏幕上，他选择通过视频会议发言，向在场的人介绍自己，并点头致意。

"Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki," the PM said. "We have received your email, and by now you should have read our preconditions, hoping that your organization should have complied promptly… Yet what is this attachment that you have thrown in? This is too large!"  
"副指挥官冬月," 首相说道。"我们已经收到了您的邮件，按理说您应该已经阅读了我们的先决条件，希望贵组织能迅速遵守……然而，您附加的这个文件是什么？这太大了！"

"Your Excellency," Fuyutsuki coolly replied. "I insist that you must see it for yourselves, for it would be most unwise to ignore the severity of the situation we are facing."  
"阁下," 冬月冷静地回答。"我坚持您必须亲自查看，因为忽视我们面临的严峻形势将是非常不明智的。"

"Very well, then," the PM said. "Now where is Commander Ikari?"  
"那么好吧," 首相说。"现在碇司令在哪里？"

"He was arrested earlier for treason and other charges, and is currently under our watch, and I am presently in charge of this facility."  
"他因叛国及其他罪名早些时候被捕，目前正处于我们的监视之下，而我目前负责这个设施。"

The PM looked surprised. "Why have you not brought him to us now?"  
首相看起来很惊讶。“为什么你们现在没有把他带来见我们？”

"I'm afraid that since he is completely incapacitated, we cannot meet your demands until Ikari is fully awake."  
"恐怕因为他目前完全无法行动，我们无法满足您的要求，直到碇醒来。"

The PM frowned. "Why?"  
首相皱眉。“为什么？”

"Again, you must first review the files, and then we shall consider your demands, as well as you looking into ours."  
“再次强调，您必须先审阅文件，然后我们再考虑您的需求，以及您对我们需求的审视。”

"And what are they?"  
“它们是什么？”

"One, we need more help to defend this base from SEELE forces," Misato said. "Two, we want guarantees that noncombatants here are given safe passage, and three, only after we successfully stop SEELE from taking control do we will comply to deactivate the Eva program thoroughly and hand Ikari over to you."  
"首先，我们需要更多援助来防御 SEELE 部队的攻击，"美里说道。"其次，我们要求确保这里的非战斗人员安全撤离，最后，只有在成功阻止 SEELE 夺取控制权后，我们才会彻底停用 Eva 计划并将碇交给你。"

"That's all?"

Misato and Fuyutsuki nodded in unison.  
美里和冬月同时点头。

"What if you're wrong?" the PM questioned. "Why we should trust you? You people have the capacity to destroy the world several times over, and we will not allow that to happen! Right now the _Jietai_ are waiting outside."  
"如果你们错了怎么办？"首相质问道。"我们为什么要相信你们？你们这些人有多次毁灭世界的能力，我们绝不允许这种事情发生！现在自卫队正在外面待命。"

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat. "As surrender is no longer an option, we would rather prepare ourselves to fight it out, to make sure the Evas and everything else does not fall into the wrong hands, even if we may have to pay it out with our own lives on the line. And if you don't believe us, would you like to be the last Prime Minister of Japan to preside over the end of mankind, with blood on your hands?"  
冬月清了清嗓子。“既然投降已不再是选项，我们宁愿准备战斗到底，确保 Eva 和其他一切不会落入错误之手，即便我们可能要以自己的生命为代价。如果你不相信我们，你愿意成为日本最后一任首相，亲手见证人类的终结，满手血腥吗？”

This time the question hit the PM squarely that he was completely speechless for a minute until he said, "Let me consult my people on this matter."  
这次质问直击首相，让他完全哑口无言，直到他说：“让我就此事咨询我的人。”

Misato nodded, and then said, "Take your time, Your Excellency."  
美里点头，然后说：“请慢慢考虑，阁下。”

---

There was a minute or two of silence as the conference room settled down to contemplate and wonder what would happen next.  
会议室里安静了一两分钟，大家都在沉思和好奇接下来会发生什么。

"Ritsuko," Misato said, breaking the impasse permeating the atmosphere.

The scientist looked at her. "Yeah?"  
科学家看着她。"嗯？"

"Forgot to ask… How's the Evas are doing?"  
“忘了问……Eva 们情况如何？”

"Oh, just wait a second," Ritsuko said as she signaled to Maya to hand over her iPad, and began playing her fingers around the touchscreen until she got the information she wanted.  
"哦，稍等一下，" 律子说着，示意玛雅递过她的 iPad，手指在触摸屏上滑动，直到找到她想要的信息。

"Well?" Misato asked. "那么？" 美里问道。

"As of this minute," Ritsuko answered. "Both Evas are currently under regeneration, at around 90% of completion. Not too serious enough to force us to do a manual bonding and suture."  
"截至此刻，" 律子回答道，"两台 EVA 都在进行再生，完成度约为 90%。还不至于严重到需要我们手动进行连接和缝合。

Misato nodded. "I see. Have you got any tricks for them?"  
美里点头。“我明白了。你有什么对付他们的招数吗？”

"I think we'll have to get started on the firmware and optimize it completely."  
“我想我们必须开始着手固件，并对其进行彻底优化。”

"Which is…?" “那是什么？”

"We need to add a little more punch to their reflexes by halving the source code for the synapse circuitry, and then adjust the electrolyte mixture to increase the neuroelectric response speeds. Not only that, I've got to tweak the onboard computers and the fire control systems, and set them up for full-on combat."  
“我们需要通过将突触电路的源代码减半来增强他们的反射能力，然后调整电解质混合物以提高神经电反应速度。不仅如此，我还得调整机载计算机和火控系统，让它们完全进入战斗状态。”

Asuka held up a hand. "'Scuse me, but what about the weapons?" she asked excitedly as if expecting presents on Christmas Day.  
明日香举起一只手。“不好意思，武器呢？”她兴奋地问道，仿佛期待着圣诞节的礼物。

In reaction, Ritsuko turned to her and smiled. "Hmmm… I can't tell you much about them, but they'll be quite a surprise."  
听到这话，律子转向她，微笑道：“嗯……关于武器，我不能透露太多，但它们会是个大惊喜。”

The redhead frowned. "Aw, come on, why the mystery? Tell me!"  
红发女孩皱起眉头。“哎呀，别卖关子了，为什么这么神秘？告诉我吧！”

"I don't like spoiling the fun, you see," Ritsuko said before chuckling. "But anyway… I'll show them to you later, okay?"  
“我不喜欢破坏乐趣，你懂的，”律子笑着说，“不过嘛……我晚点再给你看，好吗？”

Asuka nodded, although she was fuming a bit. "All right," she agreed grudgingly.  
明日香点点头，尽管她有些恼火。“好吧，”她勉强同意道。

---

For almost an hour the Security Council debated heatedly over the authenticity of the documents, with questions as to who leaked what, who was responsible for the lapse in security, how big the extent and influence of SEELE, and so on.  
近一个小时里，安全理事会就文件的真实性展开了激烈的辩论，问题涉及谁泄露了什么，谁应为安全漏洞负责，SEELE 的影响范围和力度有多大等等。

But they were left stunned and speechless, just after watching the no-longer-top-secret Antarctica footage which shown the genesis of the Second Impact.  
但在观看了不再机密的南极录像，展示了第二次冲击的起源后，他们震惊得哑口无言。

There was nothing else, but the video clearly delivered the message – more than volumes of Kaji's dossiers could ever try to convey – to them that if they fail to prevent Third Impact, as they saw in the clip, there would be no escape this time.  
除了这段视频，别无他物，但它清晰地传达了一个信息——远超过加治的档案所能尝试表达的——给他们：如果他们未能阻止第三次冲击，正如视频中所见，这次将无路可逃。

The GSDF general asked, breaking the silence. "Pardon me, Your Excellency?"  
GSDF 的将军打破了沉默，问道：“请问，阁下？”

"Yes?" the Prime Minister said, who swung his seat to face him. He looked grim-faced, he was sweating despite the air-conditioning, rivulets of sweat slipping down the sides of his face.  
“什么事？”首相说着，转过椅子面对他。他面色凝重，尽管开着空调，汗水还是不断从脸颊两侧滑落。

The general thought he could even hear the faint hammering of the old man's heart. "Have you made up your mind? The troops are ready at your word."  
将军觉得他甚至能听到老人心脏微弱的跳动声。“您决定了吗？部队已整装待发，只等您的命令。”

"And what do you think, General?"  
“那么，您怎么看，将军？”

It seemed that the general consensus of the room was that the men gathered around this conference table were now of one mind.  
似乎房间里的普遍意见是，围坐在会议桌旁的这些人现在已经达成了一致。

---

Just as they were discussing about the exact details of the defenses to be erected to protect Headquarters, the video comlink window appeared on the projector screen.  
正当他们讨论关于建立防御工事以保护总部的具体细节时，视频通讯窗口出现在投影屏幕上。

The Prime Minister appeared, but looked worried this time, a stark contrast from his earlier firm and aggressive facial expression.  
首相出现了，但这次看起来忧心忡忡，与他早先坚定而咄咄逼人的面部表情形成鲜明对比。

"We have reached a consensus, Commander," the old man said.  
“我们已经达成共识，指挥官，”老人说道。

Fuyutsuki blinked at first, but then quickly composed himself. "Pardon me?"  
冬月先是眨了眨眼，随即迅速恢复镇定。“您说什么？”

The Prime Minister took a breath, and then said, "Starting after this, we are ready to send troops to help with the defense of your base. We should not let the enemy to destroy human existence, and should we win the day, it will be appropriate that the Eva program be shut down, and Ikari and Lorenz be brought to justice."  
首相深吸了一口气，然后说道：“从现在起，我们准备派遣军队协助你们基地的防御。我们不应让敌人摧毁人类的存在，若我们获胜，届时应关闭 EVA 计划，并将碇源堂和罗兰茨绳之以法。”

"And what about us?"  
“那我们呢？”

"There will be an amnesty for all NERV personnel, and we guarantee that no harm will be caused against you or any of your men, and you are free to reorganize or dissolve NERV as you wish. It means that we have nullified Order A801."  
“所有 NERV 人员将获得大赦，我们保证不会对你们或你们的任何成员造成伤害，你们可以自由重组或解散 NERV。这意味着我们已经废除了 A801 号命令。”

There was a momentary amount of deafening silence; they could not believe it, the Prime Minister somehow cracked under pressure, and now this fateful decision.  
一阵震耳欲聋的沉默短暂降临；他们无法相信，首相竟在压力下崩溃，如今做出了这个致命的决定。

"Thank you, Your Excellency," Fuyutsuki said. "We're prepared to receive your forces as soon as possible."  
"谢谢您，阁下，" 冬月说道，"我们已准备好尽快迎接您的部队。"

The Prime Minister now looked relieved as his NERV counterpart. "My pleasure, Commander," he said. "We will contact you later, but should you need anything else, don't hesitate to call on us again."  
首相此刻看起来如释重负，与 NERV 的指挥官如出一辙。"我很荣幸，指挥官，" 他说，"我们稍后会联系您，但若您有任何其他需求，请随时再次联系我们。"

Fuyutsuki made a wry smile. "Again, thank you."  
冬月露出了苦笑。“再次感谢你。”

Only once the comlink window closed did a huge whoop of cheering erupted within the conference room, this time with no need for protocol or restraint, with everyone shaking their hands with others in congratulations, hugging, high-fives, and in the case of the Children, they group-hugged with Misato, while Maya and Ritsuko hugged tightly, both women almost in tears.  
直到通讯窗口关闭，会议室内才爆发出巨大的欢呼声，这次无需遵守任何礼仪或克制，每个人都互相握手祝贺，拥抱，击掌，而孩子们则和美里一起拥抱，摩耶和律子紧紧相拥，两位女士几乎泪流满面。

As for Tsutomo and Natsumi, well, he simply yanked the woman off her chair and kissed real tight.  
至于堤文和夏美，他直接把女人从椅子上拽起来，紧紧地吻了上去。

Hamamoto gave out a loud burst of laughter, and from his seat he stood up and clapped Fuyutsuki on the back, who looked as if he didn't mind.  
浜本放声大笑，从座位上站起来，拍了拍冬月的背，后者看起来并不介意。

"Damn, it worked! Katsuragi, you're a genius!" the old director exclaimed. "Commander, it's a miracle! The gods must be smiling at us!"  
“该死，成功了！葛城，你真是个天才！”老指挥官惊叹道，“司令，这简直是奇迹！神明一定在对我们微笑！”

Disengaging herself from her wards, Misato can only manage a grin and said, "This wouldn't be possible without Kaji."  
从她的守护者身边解脱出来，美里只能勉强一笑，说道：“没有加持，这一切都不可能实现。”

"You bet, I should raise a toast to him," Hamamoto said, before turning his attention to Fuyutsuki and smiled. "You know, sir…"  
"当然，我得为他举杯，" 羽本说，随后转向冬月，微笑道。"您知道，先生…"

The new Commander stood up and straightened out. "Yes?"  
新任指挥官站起身，整理了一下衣装。"是的？"

"I know General Yamamoto personally," the old director said. "An old classmate."  
"我与山本将军是旧识，" 老局长说道。"老同学。"

"And surely he's your drinking buddy, right?"  
"当然，他是你的酒友，对吧？"

"No kidding, I'm the godfather of his two sons. We both know that he'd been here before, but he lost his troops back when that first Angel went on attack. I bet he's sweating bullets right now, so by the time he comes down here later, he'll make you his best friend."  
"不开玩笑，我是他两个儿子的教父。我们都知道他以前来过这里，但自从第一次使徒发起攻击后，他就失去了他的部队。我敢打赌他现在紧张得要命，所以等他晚些时候下来时，他会把你当成最好的朋友。"

Hamamoto then smiled wistfully as he watched the two couples - Shinji and Asuka, Rei and Kaworu - kiss a little bit and whispered a few things amidst the cacophony of joy and laughter, despite the coming of the inevitable storm, and they have yet to see real combat.  
Hamamoto 随后带着一丝忧郁的微笑，看着那两对情侣——真嗣和明日香，丽和薰——在欢乐和笑声的喧嚣中轻轻接吻，低声细语，尽管不可避免的风暴即将来临，他们还未真正经历战斗。

**AUTHOR'S NOTES:** Finally, after a very long spell and procrastination caused by severe breaks of concentration and distraction, and real life eating up so much time that should've devoted to this fic, I've finished writing this chapter.  
作者笔记：终于，在经历了长时间的拖延和因严重注意力中断及分心导致的拖延之后，现实生活又吞噬了本应投入这篇同人文的许多时间，我完成了这篇《一千零一夜》。

Sure I had the images in my mind, but between the release of the last chapter and now, I could barely write a few more paragraphs, as it was maddening that I be disrupted badly, and before I could return to this chapter I feel tired.  
虽然我脑海中有画面，但从上一篇《一千零一夜》发布到现在，我几乎写不出几个段落，因为频繁被打断实在令人抓狂，而在我能回到这篇《一千零一夜》之前，我感到疲惫不堪。

But, anyway, I'm relieved that finally I have the time to work on this again (and other fics still waiting to be worked on). I hope that after this I'll have enough motivation and energy to finish this and more… and as always, C&C is welcome.  
不过，无论如何，我很庆幸终于有时间再次投入到这篇（以及其他等待更新的作品）中。希望这次之后我能有足够的动力和精力完成这篇以及更多作品……一如既往，欢迎评论和建议。

I'm back.

### Chapter 45 A Call to Arms  
Chapter 45 动员令

Within the hour and acting on direct orders from the Prime Minister, the _Jietai_ ground units began to move everything they had, converging themselves into the valley. Military vehicles were streaming in, with soldiers directing traffic at every intersection, while the airwaves were filled with orders, units exchanging location and status information.  
在首相的直接命令下，不到一小时，杰泰地面部队就开始调动他们所有资源，向山谷集结。军用车辆川流不息，士兵们在每个路口指挥交通，无线电波中充斥着命令、各单位交换位置和状态信息的声音。

Half of Yamamoto's forces have started to form a steel ring around the lagoon-like crater, with combat engineers bulldozing rubble to form makeshift barriers, which in turn to be reinforced with dirt and sandbags. Type-10 tanks and tracked M270 MLRS launchers would then be rolled in to position themselves hull-down behind the barriers, and meanwhile troops went about stripping their gear off and then gone to work on constructing bunkers and firing positions for heavy machine guns, mortars and anti-tank missiles. Trucks also came in with supplies, and soon the boxes of ammunition, rations, fuel, and anything needed for a very serious armed confrontation were hoarded into key spots. As for overhead protection, Patriot and anti-aircraft missile launchers were immediately stationed around this circle, and up in the air _Reisen_ fighter aircraft in groups of four flew patrols over the valley. Below them were low-flying helicopters and gunships arriving in dozens, coming over to land at makeshift landing zones, either to offload more supplies and troops, or to be armed and refueled.  
山本部队的一半兵力已经开始在环礁般的火山口周围形成一道钢铁防线，工兵们正用推土机清理碎石，搭建临时屏障，随后这些屏障会被泥土和沙袋加固。Type-10 坦克和履带式 M270 多管火箭炮系统随后被推进到屏障后隐蔽部署，同时士兵们开始卸下装备，着手建造重机枪、迫击炮和反坦克导弹的发射阵地与掩体。卡车也运来了补给，弹药、口粮、燃料以及任何进行一场严肃武装对抗所需的物资很快被囤积在关键位置。至于空中防护，爱国者和防空导弹发射器立即部署在这个环形周围，而空中则有成群的四架辉夜战斗机在山谷上空巡逻。下方，数十架低空飞行的直升机和武装直升机陆续抵达，降落在临时着陆区，或是卸载更多补给和部队，或是进行武装和加油。

The other half of those forces was also being transported into the Geofront, and as they arrived with their tanks, IFVs and APCs rolling off the trains and express elevators, the soldiers were greeted with cheers and confetti (made from torn-up phone books and printouts) coming from grateful NERV personnel who earlier thought with apprehension that the _Jietai_ could possibly destroy them.  
另一半部队同样被运送至 Geofront，当坦克、步兵战车和装甲运兵车从火车和高速电梯上滚滚而下时，士兵们受到了 NERV 人员的欢呼和五彩纸屑（由撕碎的电话簿和打印纸制成）的欢迎，这些人员此前还忧心忡忡地认为自卫队可能会摧毁他们。

Like their comrades-in-arms aboveground the _Jietai_ troops wasted no time to reinforce the defense perimeter, all weapons and troops forming a ring around the pyramid as they started stockpiling ammunition, fuel and supplies which they hope would fuel a stiff defense should the enemy breach into the Geofront.  
如同地面上的战友们一样，自卫队士兵们毫不耽搁地加强防御圈，所有武器和部队围绕金字塔形成环形，开始储备弹药、燃料和补给，希望这些能支撑起一道坚固的防线，以防敌人突破进入 Geofront。

But even with this miraculous infusion of men and materiel, they asked themselves about the would-be enemy they might soon encounter: how big they could be? Where they could come from? How powerful are their weapons?  
尽管这次奇迹般的兵力和物资注入，他们仍不禁自问即将面对的敌人会是怎样的：他们会有多大？会从哪里来？他们的武器有多强大？

Among those who were asking those biting questions inwardly was General Yamamoto, as he and his aides were riding one of the express elevators, along with their gear and documents; his first agenda upon getting off the elevator was to meet up with his NERV counterparts.  
在那些内心提出尖锐问题的人中，就有山本将军，他和他的助手们正乘坐一趟高速电梯，随身携带着装备和文件；他下电梯后的首要议程是与 NERV 的同事会面。

In Siberia, and inside the command center, Keel Lorenz grimly stared at the video wall, watching the world new outlets burst into a flurry of announcements and flash reports, all of the talking heads speaking of an enigmatic organization responsible for a massive conspiracy on a global scale. They even played the now-infamous secret UN video footage purportedly showing the root cause of the Second Impact.  
在西伯利亚，指挥中心内，基尔·洛伦兹阴沉地盯着视频墙，看着世界新闻媒体突然爆发出一系列声明和突发报道，所有评论员都在谈论一个神秘组织，该组织涉嫌策划了一场全球性的大阴谋。他们甚至播放了那段如今臭名昭著的联合国秘密视频，据称显示了第二次冲击的根源。

His followers, all dressed in monk-like robes, appeared to be nervous, with one daring to ask, "May I ask a question, Master?"  
他的追随者们，都身着类似僧侣的长袍，显得有些紧张，其中一人鼓起勇气问道：“我可以问个问题吗，大师？”

"Yes?" Keel responded. “什么事？”基尔回应道。

"They could stop us before we can even begin," the aide said. "Either Ikari or Fuyutsuki must have acted on their own accord. This smacks of treason."  
"他们可以在我们开始之前就阻止我们，"助手说。"无论是碇源堂还是冬月耕造，必定是擅自行动。这简直是叛国。"

Keel snorted. "They can talk all they want, surely expecting their governments to respond, but we have made preparations for that."  
基尔冷哼一声。"他们尽管说吧，肯定期待着各自政府的回应，但我们已经为此做好了准备。"

The aide blinked. "How?"  
助手眨了眨眼。"怎么准备？"

"You should know that we still have our loyalists in high office," Keel said in a rather confident tone. "They will do everything in their power to delay, if not stop, any action that could be initiated against our will. Not even the President of the United States can dare try."  
"你应该知道，我们高层仍有忠实的支持者，"基尔以相当自信的语气说道，"他们会尽一切可能拖延，甚至阻止任何违背我们意愿的行动。即便是美国总统也不敢轻易尝试。"

The aide said nothing, as Keel turned to face him.  
助手一言不发，基尔转过身来面对他。

"I intend that we start as scheduled," the old man said, "rather than take any hasty course of action, which could waste more of our time and resources than what is necessary. Symbolically we will attack at dawn, and make the world know that its end is at nigh."  
"我打算按计划行事，"老人说道，"而不是采取任何仓促的行动，那样只会浪费我们更多的时间和资源。象征性地，我们将在黎明时分发起攻击，让世界知道末日将近。"

Only then Keel saw Quaritch enter the control room; inwardly he was surprised, but reacted only by blinking.  
直到那时，基尔才看到夸里奇进入了控制室；他内心感到惊讶，但只是眨了眨眼作为反应。

"Where have you been?" Keel asked as he picked up his half-full cup of tea.  
“你去哪儿了？”基尔拿起他那半满的茶杯问道。

"I'm sorry, I went to the toilet," Quaritch said. "Had to take my dosage… But, sir, what's up?"  
“对不起，我去了洗手间，”夸里奇说，“得吃药……不过，长官，有什么事吗？”

After taking a long sip, Keel nodded. "It's happening," he said flatly, upraising his right hand and swept across the video wall full of talking heads. "What can you say about this?"  
喝了一大口后，基尔点了点头。“正在发生，”他平淡地说道，举起右手，在满是谈话头的视频墙上扫过。“对此你有什么看法？”

---

For Shinji, he had a surreal feeling of unreality, as they watched, from their vantage point on the balcony overseeing the HQ parking lot, the _Jietai_ tanks and vehicles coming down here in droves, soldiers frantically directing every one of them to park at specified spots, to await for further orders to reposition. They could also smell the pall of diesel smoke, prompting Asuka to momentarily cover her mouth and try to get hold of her handkerchief from the pocket.  
对于真嗣来说，他有一种超现实的不真实感，他们从俯瞰总部停车场的阳台上看到，自卫队的坦克和车辆成群结队地驶来，士兵们疯狂地指挥每一辆停到指定位置，等待进一步的重新部署命令。他们还能闻到柴油烟的浓烈气味，这让明日香暂时捂住口鼻，试图从口袋里拿出手帕。

"Kaworu," Shinji said to the young man standing besides him, "Do you think this could be enough?"  
“薰，”真嗣对站在他身边的年轻人说，“你觉得这足够了吗？”

"I hope so," Kaworu replied, with Rei besides him and watching silently. "If my memory is correct about the size of SEELE's forces, however, even if we now have this country's military on our side, we'll have a very tough chance."  
"希望如此，" 渚薰回答道，身边是静静观察的绫波零。"但如果我对 Seele 兵力的记忆无误，即便我们现在得到了这个国家的军队支持，胜算依然十分艰难。"

The Children can then see, at one part of the parking lot, scores of mechanics swarming over a dozen pickup trucks, armed with their tools to transform this fleet into armed vehicles called "technicals", as Misato had earlier explained as she issued orders to the chief of the vehicle maintenance division: they would install machine gun mounts and attach sheets of thick metal to act as armor plating.  
孩子们可以看到，在停车场的一角，数十名机械师正围着十几辆皮卡忙碌着，他们手持工具，将这些车辆改装成被称为"技术车"的武装车辆，正如美里之前在向车辆维修部门负责人下达命令时解释的那样：他们将安装机枪架并附加厚金属板作为装甲。

Nearby, standing on top of one Humvee and with a bullhorn in hand, Makoto Hyuga was busy calling out for volunteers to sign up and get trained for a crash course in basic infantry skills and weapons familiarization and usage. Below him, several long lines have formed, snaking their way to a makeshift registration booth, where would-be volunteers were questioned about any prior military experience and assigned according to their skill level; those with more experience were qualified to lead any formation up to platoon level. The volunteers would then be issued his or her equipment, and an assault rifle with five magazines to go with it, before led on to a cluster of tents set up to serve as field classrooms. Just beyond that was a makeshift firing range on the lawn, where the volunteers would try to hone their aiming skills, with experienced Section Two troopers to assist them. They could hear the loud crack of controlled gunfire, with the practicing volunteers trying to learn how to shoot in semi-auto.  
附近，站在一辆悍马车顶，手持扩音器的 Makoto Hyuga 正忙着号召志愿者报名参加突击训练，学习基础步兵技能和武器熟悉与使用。他下方，几条长队已经形成，蜿蜒至一个临时登记棚，那里准志愿者们被询问是否有军事经验，并根据技能水平分配；经验较丰富者有资格领导至排级队伍。随后，志愿者们会领取装备，包括一支突击步枪和五个弹匣，然后被带到一排作为野外教室的帐篷。再过去是一片草地上的临时射击场，志愿者们在此磨练瞄准技巧，有经验的第二分队士兵协助他们。他们能听到控制下的枪声，练习中的志愿者们努力学习半自动射击。

Shinji frowned a bit at Kaworu. "'Tough chance'? I thought you were hopeful?"  
Shinji 对 Kaworu 皱了皱眉。"'渺茫的机会'？我以为你很乐观？"

Kaworu shook his head. "No, I mean… Seriously, what opposition we'll be looking at could bring an uneven battle, if not dirty. From what I have understood while reading the history of mankind, in war there's no such thing as a fair fight. It's not like boxing where you have a referee and judges to decide your victory."  
渚薰摇了摇头。“不，我是说……认真地讲，我们面临的对手可能会导致一场不公平的战斗，如果不是肮脏的话。根据我阅读人类历史所了解的，战争中不存在公平的较量。这不像拳击，有裁判和评委来判定你的胜利。”

Shinji nodded. "I see."  
真嗣点头。“我明白了。”

He then remembered the first time he came here, but found himself smack in the middle of a battle between the _Jietai_ and that Angel, as they tried to kill it with bullets and missiles, but never stood a chance as their towering enemy simply demolished them all like a child scattering small toys out of the way.  
他随即想起了自己第一次来到这里时的情景，却发现自己正处在自卫队与那个使徒之间的战斗中，他们试图用子弹和导弹杀死它，但从未有机会，因为那个高大的敌人就像孩子把小玩具踢开一样轻易地摧毁了他们。

It was only when he was riding the Eva that he gave that Angel an equal to fight with, but at that time he knew nothing about fighting, he was thrown in at the last minute, and it was quite a shock for him to be put into war without much ado.  
只有在驾驶 Eva 时，他才给了那个使徒一个势均力敌的对手，但那时他对战斗一无所知，他被临时拉入，毫无准备地投入战争，对他来说确实是个巨大的冲击。

But Unit-01 did the killing for him, destroying the Angel with brutal efficiency.  
但零一机替他完成了击杀，以残忍的效率摧毁了使徒。

"I've decided," Shinji finally said.  
“我决定了，”真嗣终于说道。

"What?" Asuka said. "什么？" 明日香说。

He turned to face her. "We'll deal with those other Evas only. I don't want to kill another man again, and besides, our Evas alone can't be stopped easily by any army."  
他转过身面对她。"我们只对付那些其他 EVA。我不想再杀另一个人了，而且，仅凭我们的 EVA，任何军队都难以轻易阻止。"

"We'll leave the hand-to-hand fighting to Misato instead," Asuka said, and just as she was about to say another word, Misato walked into the balcony.  
"我们把近身战交给美里吧，" 明日香说，就在她正要说另一个词时，美里走进了阳台。

"Are you guys coming with me?" she asked.  
“你们要跟我一起来吗？”她问道。

The older woman was now wearing, apart from her battle dress uniform and a pair of Adidas GSG tactical boots, a PASGT combat vest, with a Thales AN/PRC-148 radio clipped to the back and with a throat mike connected, to permit troop-to-troop communications. Slung from her shoulder was an H&K G36K assault rifle, with her sidearm in its holster and riding on the right hip, and in her right hand was a folder.  
这位年长的女士现在除了穿着战斗服和一双阿迪达斯 GSG 战术靴外，还套着一件 PASGT 战斗背心，背心后面夹着一个泰雷兹 AN/PRC-148 无线电，喉麦连接着，以便进行部队间的通讯。她肩上挎着一支 H&K G36K 突击步枪，手枪装在枪套里，挂在右胯上，右手则拿着一个文件夹。

In full battle gear, Misato looked very formidable.  
全副武装的 Misato 看起来非常威严。

"Whoa… Where?" Asuka asked.  
"哇…哪里？" 明日香问道。

"I'd like all of you to meet up with the _Jietai_ general in charge."  
"我希望你们所有人能与负责的自卫队将军会面。"

Except for the 150-kilometer radius around Hakone, which was still being vacated, the rest of Japan was now in complete lockdown, more than six hours after the declaration of martial law, and as such, families were forced to stay indoors, prohibited from coming out into the streets. All activity, including school and work activities, and also domestic and international travel, were suspended until further notice.  
除了箱根周边 150 公里半径的区域仍在疏散中，日本其他地区在宣布戒严令六个多小时后已全面封锁，因此家庭被迫待在室内，禁止上街。所有活动，包括学校和工作活动，以及国内和国际旅行，均已暂停，直至另行通知。

At present, only the local police and military vehicles were cruising the empty streets, while helicopters flew above, their bullhorns repeatedly warning the populace.  
目前，只有当地警察和军用车辆在空荡荡的街道上巡逻，直升机在空中盘旋，它们的扩音器反复向民众发出警告。

Like many cities across the country, Tokyo-2 was almost a ghost town, and down in the suburban area where the resettlement zone was located, Toji Suzuhara was already chafing at the sudden national imposition of martial law.  
像全国许多城市一样，东京-2 几乎成了一座鬼城，而在郊区的安置区，碇真嗣已经对国家突然实施的戒严令感到不耐烦。

But like the rest of his companions sitting on the nine-tatami mat, they all feel nervous, fearing that the worst may soon come, which meant their greatest concerns were focused on the four Children stationed hundreds of kilometers away.  
但和他坐在九张榻榻米上的同伴们一样，他们都感到紧张，担心最坏的情况可能即将到来，这意味着他们最担心的是驻扎在数百公里外的四个孩子们。

"Damn," Toji muttered as he put down his cellular phone on the coffee table. "I still can't call any of them on the phone for the umpteenth time, and I'm sure that we can't even use the Internet."  
“该死，” 冬二喃喃自语，将手机放在咖啡桌上。“我还是打不通他们的电话，已经试了无数次了，而且我敢肯定我们连互联网都用不了。”

"Of course they'll not allow us," Kensuke Aida reminded, tearing his gaze away from the television, which was tuned only to NHK and the newscaster droning on, with the government-owned television network currently authorized to broadcast, constantly airing the news and interspersed with reminders to citizens to remain at home, and to wait for further official announcements. "The lockdown's in full effect. Nothing goes in or out, and other than the official PR we're completely in the dark."  
“他们当然不会让我们用，” 真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯提醒道，目光从只播放 NHK 新闻的电视机上移开，政府拥有的电视台目前被授权播出，不断播放新闻，并穿插提醒市民待在家中，等待官方进一步通知。“封锁已经全面生效。任何东西都进不来也出不去，除了官方的宣传，我们完全一无所知。”

Toji fumed. How he wished he could have contacted his buddies earlier before the lockdown came in, and he wanted to know a clear picture of what was going on. He then turned to Hikari Horaki, who was playing a game of UNO with her sisters and Mari; they were trying their best of making something good out of their predicament, but Toji could see that Hikari's eyes were expressing doubt and her light laughter was one of unease than genuine.  
冬二气愤不已。他多么希望在封锁之前能联系上他的朋友们，他想知道事情的真相。然后他转向光莉·霍拉基，她正在和她的姐妹们以及玛丽玩 UNO；她们尽力在困境中找点乐子，但冬二看得出光莉的眼神中流露出疑虑，她的轻笑更多的是不安而非真正的快乐。

Even Pen-Pen, normally an energetic creature who seemed to possess intelligence more unusual than any of his fellows within the same genus, instead lay by Hikari's hip as if he needed her presence for the sake of comfort.  
就连平时精力充沛、似乎拥有比同类更不寻常智慧的 Pen-Pen，也静静地躺在光的大腿旁，仿佛需要她的存在来寻求安慰。

He then stood up and to Kensuke he said, "Say, why don't you join me at the veranda?"  
他随后站起身，对真希波说：“嘿，不如你跟我去阳台上坐坐？”

Kensuke rose onto his feet. "Sure," he answered.  
真希波站了起来。“当然，”他回答道。

---

Momentarily distracted from the card game, Hikari watched the two boys go out into the veranda, thinking they could get some fresh air, but as Kensuke closed the door, she knew it was going to be some serious talk between those two.  
一时被纸牌游戏分了心，光看着两个男孩走向阳台，心想他们可能是去透透气，但当健介关上门时，她知道这将是两人之间的一场严肃对话。

Which led the girl to worry about her classmates, wondering what they were doing at this very moment.  
这让她开始担心起她的同学们，想知道他们此刻正在做什么。

She remembered their last conversation over the Internet, which was of joy and congratulations, of seeing Shinji and Asuka now as lovers. How she would love to see them come to school together with their hands clasped, their blossoming romance a great spectacle of the whole campus.  
她记得他们上次在网上聊天的内容，充满了喜悦和祝贺，看到真嗣和明日香如今成为恋人。她多么希望看到他们手牵手一起来学校，他们初绽的爱情成为整个校园的一大盛景。

If they could just come together again in the same classroom, but the sordid truth was that their school was a pile of rubble, that it could take a year or so before that school be rebuilt completely.  
如果他们能再次在同一间教室相聚，但那不堪的真相是，他们的学校已成废墟，可能需要一年左右的时间才能完全重建。

Oh, she missed the daily routine of her being 2-A's class representative, and wished none of the violence engendered by the Angel attacks ever happened at all.  
哦，她怀念起自己作为 2-A 班班长的日常，并希望天使袭击引发的暴力从未发生过。

---

Once Kensuke closed the sliding door, only then Toji began to speak.  
直到健介关上滑动门，真嗣才开始说话。

"How long do you think this stuck-up's gonna last?" he asked.  
"你觉得这个自命不凡的家伙能撑多久？" 他问道。

"Maybe anywhere from three days to a week," Kensuke answered as he rested his arms on the railing. The late morning brought in some wind, but the only sounds they could hear were chirping birds and the distant siren of some patrol car. As always the streets were empty.  
"大概三到七天吧，" 真嗣回答，双臂搭在栏杆上。临近中午时分，微风徐来，但他们能听到的只有鸟鸣和远处警车的警笛声。一如既往，街道空无一人。

"Shit," Toji cursed. "I'm still really worried about them."  
"该死，" 冬二咒骂道。"我还是真的很担心他们。

Kensuke made a sour face. "Yeah, me too, especially they're smack in the middle of the mess."  
健介做了个苦脸。“是啊，我也是，尤其是他们正处在混乱的中心。”

"Do you have any idea what the government is really up to?"  
“你知道政府到底在搞什么鬼吗？”

"If they think NERV is a problem, it makes sense that they'll go to great lengths to make this look like an industrial accident waiting to happen, and what they're doing is far too big not to ignore."  
“如果他们认为 NERV 是个问题，那么他们会不择手段让这看起来像是一场随时可能发生的工业事故，而他们所做的规模之大，不容忽视。”

"And why would the government dislikes NERV?"  
"政府为何会不喜欢 NERV？"

"My dad told me a few things, nasty rumors really, about a few Diet members he know of talking about NERV the other day."  
"我爸跟我说了些事，其实是些难听的谣言，关于他认识的几个国会议员前几天谈论 NERV 的情况。"

Toji nodded. "Go on."  
剑介点头。"继续。"

"Although they've not mentioned about it in public, there's a growing majority in the Diet who wants that organization to be disbanded completely for having excess power and autonomy, and some even say that the Evas are too powerful that their use should be curbed just like nuclear, chemical or biological weapons."  
"尽管他们在公开场合并未提及，但国会中越来越多的人希望彻底解散那个组织，因为它拥有过多的权力和自主权，甚至有人认为 Eva 过于强大，其使用应受到限制，就像核武器、化学武器或生物武器一样。"

"Yeah, they're that dangerous," Toji said. "But I know Shinji's an okay guy who knows where and when to put her to fight, but only that his dad is an asshole for causing this."  
"是啊，它们确实很危险，" 冬二说。"但我知道真嗣是个好人，知道何时何地该让她战斗，只是他爸搞出这些事来真是混蛋。"

For a moment he then absentmindedly adjusted his artificial leg, before Toji closed his eyes for a moment, and tried to will himself to imagine what was going on down at the Geofront.  
他一时心不在焉地调整了一下假腿，然后冬二闭上眼睛，试图让自己想象地下 Geofront 正在发生的事情。

He pictured the whole place being prepared for war, just like the movie he and Kensuke saw on TV several nights ago, which depicted the battle of Iwo Jima, the one where the imperial soldiers decided to make a final stand to defend the island and kill as many Americans as they could, only to be defeated in the end, paying a terrible price for defending a piece of rock in a vast sea.  
他想象着整个地方正为战争做准备，就像他和真希波几天前在电视上看的那部电影一样，描绘了硫磺岛战役，那次帝国士兵决定坚守阵地，尽可能多地消灭美国人，最终却战败了，为保卫茫茫大海中的一块岩石付出了惨重代价。

Shivering, Toji thought if the situation in Hakone could be just as it was in the movie, and thus he prayed that they – Shinji and Asuka, Rei and Kaworu – were all right, not knowing that in reality it was a very different picture indeed.  
颤抖着，冬二心想如果箱根的情况能像电影里那样就好了，于是他祈祷着——真嗣和明日香，绫波和薰——他们都平安无事，却不知道现实情况确实截然不同。

Misato and the Children arrived at the reception hall, to find the _Jietai_ officers and their NERV counterparts present, with Fuyutsuki turning to face them and smile. He was no longer wearing his customary formal uniform, but like Misato, dressed in a BDU except it was his first time.  
美里和孩子们到达了接待大厅，发现自卫队军官和 NERV 的同事们都在场，其中冬月转向他们微笑。他不再穿着惯常的正式制服，而是和美里一样，穿着 BDU，尽管这是他第一次这样打扮。

Earlier the old man received the combat uniform wrapped in plastic, and though he was hardly a combatant throughout his entire life, the circumstances he was in called for this. As he dressed up, it was only then that if he needed to lead people, it was necessary to identify with his subordinates, to say firmly that he was willing to fight alongside with them.  
早些时候，老人收到了用塑料包裹的战斗服，尽管他一生中几乎不是战士，但所处的环境要求他如此。当他穿上衣服时，他意识到，如果需要领导人们，就必须与下属认同，坚定地表示他愿意与他们并肩作战。

Also present were Ritsuko and Maya, both women wearing work coveralls, and Director Hamamoto and his crack troops of the Second Section SRT, all dressed in the same urban camo fatigues and armed to the teeth.  
在场的有律子和真希波，两位女士穿着工作服，还有桥本导演和他的第二科 SRT 精锐部队，所有人都穿着相同的都市迷彩服，武装到了牙齿。

"Well, good thing you people have come just in time," Fuyutsuki said.  
“嗯，幸好你们及时赶到，”冬月说。

"Thank you, sir," Misato said before she saluted at General Yamamoto and his staff, and they returned the favor at the same time, and then the general offered his hand. Misato took it and shook hands.  
"谢谢您，先生，"美里在向山本将军及其参谋敬礼后说道，他们同时回礼，随后将军伸出手来。美里握住并摇了摇手。

"Nice to meet you," Yamamoto said as he noted her cuff rank; she was now lieutenant-colonel. "It's quite a surprise that you rose up quickly in command, Colonel. Last time I saw you, you were then a captain."  
"很高兴见到你，"山本注意到她的袖标军衔；她现在已是中校。"你在指挥层级上晋升得相当迅速，上校。上次见你时，你还只是个上尉。"

"My pleasure, sir," Misato replied as they disengaged.  
"这是我的荣幸，长官，"美里在他们松开手后回答道。

The general then went on to shake hands with each of the Children and exchanged a few words. It was with Kaworu that he noted a peculiar similarity with Rei, before he focused back to Fuyutsuki and said, "As my government has promised, I've brought the entire division to defend this place, top to bottom. If they come, we'll throw everything we've got at them, from land, sea and air."  
将军随后逐一与孩子们握手，并简短交谈。他注意到渚与绫波之间有一种奇特的相似之处，随后将注意力转回冬月身上，说道：“正如我国政府所承诺的，我已带领整个师团来保卫此地，从上到下。如果他们来袭，我们将从陆地、海洋和空中倾尽全力反击。”

"You forgot to mention the Evas," Asuka said pointedly.  
“你忘了提 EVA。”明日香直截了当地说。

Yamamoto chuckled. "Oh, sorry… the Evas," he said, before his facial expression turned stern. "Commander Fuyutsuki, it would be a great honor to work with you once again, and we look forward to completing our mission to defend humanity against possible annihilation."  
山本轻笑一声。“哦，抱歉……EVA。”他说着，表情变得严肃起来。“冬月指挥官，能再次与您合作是我们的荣幸，我们期待着完成保卫人类免遭可能的灭绝这一使命。”

Fuyutsuki and Hamamoto nodded. "It's also a great honor that your Prime Minister has sent you to help us," the new Commander said.  
冬月和滨本点了点头。“贵国总理派您来协助我们，也是我们的荣幸，”新任指挥官说道。

"Thank you, but I'd like to tell you a little story," Yamamoto said.  
“谢谢，不过我想给你们讲个小故事，”山本说。

Fuyutsuki blinked. "I beg your pardon?"  
冬月眨了眨眼。“您说什么？”

"Well… According to my boss down at the command bunker, the new intel that you people mailed to him was quite a sensation," Yamamoto remarked. "Seriously it changed his mind, especially with that UN video."  
""嗯…根据我在指挥掩体内的上司所说，你们寄给他的新情报可真是轰动一时，" 山本评论道。"说真的，这改变了他

"That's very good news," Fuyutsuki said.

"But after watching that, my boss saw the old man looked pale, as if he came across a ghost, and quickly went to the toilet... probably to pee. The whole thing scared the hell out of him."

Everyone suddenly laughed at Yamamoto's little anecdote, breaking the tension in the air and bringing in much-needed levity to an otherwise serious situation.  
众人突然对山本的小轶事大笑起来，打破了空气中的紧张气氛，为原本严肃的场合带来了急需的轻松。

"Anyway," Yamamoto said afterwards. "Where do we begin?"  
“总之，”山本随后说道，“我们从哪里开始？”

Outside, at the improvised shooting range near the Pyramid, many of the volunteers were practicing with the assault rifles and pistols, guided by experienced instructors who tutored them on the finer points of aiming their weapons, emphasizing on shooting at the center of mass as opposed to mere marksmanship. Others were taking one-on-one instructions on how to throw a grenade, using large round stones as stand-ins for the real deadly thing.  
在金字塔附近的临时射击场外，许多志愿者正在练习使用突击步枪和手枪，由经验丰富的教官指导他们瞄准武器的精细要点，强调射击身体中心而非仅仅是射击技巧。其他人则在一对一的指导下学习如何投掷手榴弹，用大圆石作为真实致命物品的替代品。

Not far from the shooting range and its loud staccato of gunfire was a tent erected as a makeshift classroom for the volunteers, and right now Tsutomo Kanzaki was lecturing about the basic information on the M4A1 rifle, once the mainstay weapon of the American army. Right in front of him was a table, and further out was his class, volunteers clad in urban camo fatigues; behind Tsutomo was a whiteboard scribbled with his own notations.  
射击场不远处，枪声的响亮断奏中，一顶帐篷被搭建成了志愿者们的临时教室，此刻冢本勤正在讲解 M4A1 步枪的基本信息，这款曾是美军主力武器的枪械。他面前是一张桌子，再往外是他的班级，身着城市迷彩服的志愿者们；冢本身后是一块白板上潦草地写着他的笔记。

"This here is the Colt M4A1 assault rifle," Tsutomo began in English, hefting the weapon with both hands. "It can shoot 5.56-millimeter standardized NATO bullets from a 30-round magazine, at a firing rate of anywhere from 750 to 900 rounds per minute. Being shorter than the older M16 rifle, and also a direct descendant of the Colt Commando, it has an adjustable stock so that even the shortest of us can aim and shoot comfortably. The reduced size also makes it lighter to carry almost anywhere.  
"“这是柯尔特 M4A1 突击步枪，”冢本用英语开始讲解，双手举起武器。“它可以发射 5.56 毫米标准北约弹药，从 30 发弹匣中以每分钟 750 至 900 发的射速射击。由于比老式的 M16 步枪更短，并且是柯尔特突击队的直接后代，它具有可调节的枪托，即使是身材最矮小的人也能舒适地瞄准和射击。尺寸的减小也使得它几乎在任何地方携带都更轻便。”

"Like its predecessor, but heck a lot more with the Picatinny rail on top of the receiver, the M4 can be customized extensively with any accessories, depending on the mission the weapon would be used for. In our case, every M4 you will be using is the MWS variant, which comes with a foregrip, a reflex red dot sight, and an AN/PEQ-2 laser pointer system, except for a customized batch made for spec-ops but now issued pronto to our SRTs.  
与前代相似，但顶部接收器上加装了皮卡汀尼导轨，M4 可以广泛定制各种配件，具体取决于武器将用于何种任务。在我们的情况下，你们将使用的每一支 M4 都是 MWS 型号，配备了前握把、反射式红点瞄准镜和 AN/PEQ-2 激光指示器系统，除了为特种作战定制的一批现已紧急配发给我们的 SRT。

"Apart from your M4s, you will also be issued with five magazines per man, due to our limited stocks, but in the heat of battle I know that the magazines for Type-89 rifles can't be used with the M4 because of a design flaw, which makes them non-STANAG, yet the ammo from those mags can be utilized instead, so try to pick them up while you can and wherever you find them, then fill up the mags."  
除了你们的 M4，每人还将配发五个弹匣，由于我们的库存有限，但在战斗激烈时，我知道 Type-89 步枪的弹匣不能与 M4 通用，因为设计缺陷导致它们不符合 STANAG 标准，不过这些弹匣里的子弹可以利用，所以尽量在能找到的地方捡起它们，然后装满弹匣。

Tsutomo laid down the M4 and said, "While some of you are veterans, mostly from the last war in Korea, this is in effect refresher training to get yourselves up to date, because what you learn here today could save your life tomorrow… So, any questions?"  
筒本放下 M4 说道：“虽然你们中有些人是老兵，大多来自上一次朝鲜战争，但这实际上是复习训练，让你们跟上时代，因为今天在这里学到的知识可能在明天就能救你一命……所以，有什么问题吗？”

A volunteer, a lance corporal, raised his hand and asked, "Sir, where did we got them, and when?"  
一名志愿兵，一等兵，举手问道：“长官，我们是从哪儿弄到这些枪的，什么时候？”

"A few days ago," Tsutomo said. "They're basically surplus from the US government, because they're switching over to newer anything, and these weapons have been replaced by the SCAR series of rifles. Now if any of you are worried about any malfunctions, every rifle issued to you has their own servicing records, and they have been given great care and maintenance, even if most of them haven't seen action for more than a decade."  
“几天前，”堤文说，“这些基本上是美国政府的剩余物资，因为他们正在全面更新装备，这些武器已被 SCAR 系列步枪所取代。现在，如果你们中有人担心故障问题，发放给你们的每一支步枪都有自己的维护记录，并且它们得到了精心保养，尽管其中大多数已经超过十年未曾投入实战。”

Another volunteer's hand, a staff sergeant, shot up as soon as the first questioner settled down onto his seat.  
第一位提问者刚坐下，另一名志愿兵，一名上士，立刻举起了手。

Tsutomo pointed his finger. "Yes, please?"  
筒友伸出手指。“是的，请说？”

"Sir, do you have any more intel about the possible opposition?" the volunteer asked. "I mean, sir, what kind of gear they could be carrying? What about this private army that Colonel Katsuragi spoke about?"  
“先生，您还有关于可能的对手的情报吗？”志愿者问道，“我是说，先生，他们可能携带什么样的装备？还有高须贺义见上校提到的私人军队呢？”

Tsutomo frowned. "You mean the GPE – Global Protection Enterprises – boys?"  
筒友皱起眉头。“你是说 GPE——全球保护企业——的那帮人？”

"That's right, sir." "正是如此，先生。"

"If my memory serves me right about reading their PR sometimes ago," Tsutomo said. "I remember that they have the best equipment in their inventory than any other PMC in history, which means that every one of their soldiers, mercenaries really, have their own pick of weapons and personal equipment, apart from volunteering themselves to field-test and fire working prototypes from defense contractors… and this is where we could have a problem, sergeant."  
"如果我没记错的话，我曾在不久前读过他们的公关资料，" 筒友说。"我记得他们的装备库存是史上任何其他私人军事公司都无法比拟的，这意味着他们的每一位士兵，确切地说是雇佣兵，都能自由选择武器和个人装备，除了自愿参与测试和试用来自国防承包商的工作原型武器……而这正是我们可能会遇到问题的地方，中士。"

The volunteers started to whisper imprecations and make faces.  
志愿者们开始低声咒骂并做出不满的表情。

"If they're armed and equipped with anything that's ten years ahead of even the most powerful militaries on the planet, say, with magazine clips loaded with armor-piercing rounds not approved by the Geneva Convention, surveillance drones about the size of a fly, or lightweight armor that can stop an AK-47 round, there's another piece of advice that I would find very useful for all of us: remember that even the best advanced technology is still vulnerable to the most primitive forms of warfare."  
"如果他们武装到了牙齿，装备了比地球上最强大的军队还要先进十年的武器，比如装有未获日内瓦公约批准的穿甲弹的弹匣，苍蝇大小的监视无人机，或是能挡住 AK-47 子弹的轻型装甲，那么我还有一条建议对大家非常有用：记住，即使是最尖端的科技，也依然可能被最原始的战争形式所击败。"

"Sounds like 'asymmetrical warfare', sir," the sergeant corrected him.  
"听起来像是‘不对称战争’，长官，" 中士纠正道。"

"That's correct," Tsutomo agreed, before he scribbled 'asymmetrical warfare' on the whiteboard. "That form of warfighting has been proven from time to time, taking advantage of the weaknesses inherent in the enemy, even if he's well-fed, well-armed and trained, and has a lot of technological muscle compared to his opponent, and if you know your history, it's the kind of warfare that forced the American withdrawal from Vietnam, and some decades later, the Soviets from Afghanistan.  
"没错，" 筒本赞同地点头，随后在白板上潦草地写下‘不对称战争’。"这种战争形式屡试不爽，利用敌人固有的弱点，即便对方装备精良、训练有素，且在技术上远超对手。如果你了解历史，就会知道这种战争曾迫使美国从越南撤军，几十年后，苏联也从阿富汗撤退。

"However, while those guerillas were able to do so in a few years by progressively wearing down their opponents in several fronts without having to launch a major offensive, we don't have much time on our hands, just hours. But I'm sure some of you have any ideas on how we could deal with the opposition, even if he's ten feet tall and feeling damn cocky."  
“然而，那些游击队能够在几年内通过逐步削弱对手在多个前线的力量，无需发动大规模攻势就能取得成功，但我们没有那么多时间，只有几个小时。但我相信你们中有些人一定有办法对付对手，哪怕他十英尺高且自信心爆棚。”

Tsutomo went around to the front of the table and asked, "So, does anyone have something else good to suggest, and if possible, I could even forward it to Colonel Katsuragi? Like her, I'm all ears."  
津友绕到桌子前面问道：“那么，有人有其他好建议吗？如果可能的话，我甚至可以转告给葛城美里上校。和她一样，我洗耳恭听。”

In no time and to his surprise, the agent saw a lot of upraised hands, before he saw a very elderly man, still wearing his lab coat, stand up from his seat.  
不出所料，令他惊讶的是，特工很快看到许多举起的手，随后看到一位穿着实验室外套的非常年长的老人从座位上站了起来。

"Pardon me, sir?" Tsutomo asked, before he recognized the oldest volunteer in this class. "Oh, Doctor Tien, you're volunteering for this?"  
“不好意思，先生？”筒友问道，随后认出了这个班级里最年长的志愿者。“哦，天博士，您也来参加这个吗？”

Doctor Huy "Henry" Tien raised his hand; the elderly, silver-haired Vietnamese organic chemist was once a teenage NVA soldier who alternately manned an anti-aircraft gun during the bombing raids over Hanoi and worked at a war factory that manufactured satchel charges by the hundreds for the Vietcong down south. After the war he was sent to Moscow on a free scholarship provided by the Soviets, then later returned home a brilliant man, to help his country by making contributions to science until, by his government's prodding, he volunteered for NERV.  
许博士（亨利）天举起了手；这位年迈、银发的越南有机化学家曾是少年时期的北越军队士兵，在河内轰炸期间交替操作防空炮，并在南方为越共制造数百个炸药包的战争工厂工作。战后，他被苏联提供的免费奖学金送往莫斯科，后来以杰出人才的身份回国，为科学贡献力量，直至在政府的推动下，他自愿加入 NERV。

"Yes, my department might want to contribute anything substantial for our defense," Tien said.  
“是的，我的部门可能想为我们的防御贡献一些实质性的东西，”天博士说。

"And what is it, sir?"  
"先生，这是什么？"

"We will try to create improvised explosives from out of any materials we have on hand," Tien answered. "Yes, assuming if my memory of my war days still serves me right, I also have the experience in making them, especially that we could produce ANFO explosives in large quantities."  
"我们将尝试用现有的材料制作简易爆炸物，""天回答道。""是的，如果我战争时期的记忆还准确的话，我也有制作它们的经验，特别是我们可以大量生产 ANFO 炸药。"

Tsutomo grinned. "Excellent, sir," he remarked. "I didn't know that."  
津友笑了。""太好了，先生，""他评论道。""我之前不知道这一点。"

"Normally," Tien said, "some of us veterans don't want to talk much about our war stories because of trauma, that we don't want to relive about watching fellow soldiers die right before our very eyes, that we become almost deaf from the explosions, that some of us wake up to find a leg or a hand missing. For years after the war, I want to forget all that by burying myself deep into studies, thinking it would save me from the pain… Yet my experience of the war can't be erased altogether, it has become part of me till the day I die, and ever since I started working here I have gained many friends that they're almost family to me, so in a sense I'm more of a father to them. But, young man, should they be threatened by harm, or if any peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the problem we're facing fails, I will not regret about taking up arms once again on their behalf and _of humanity_, even if I'm an old man."  
"通常，" Tien 说，"我们这些老兵不太愿意多谈战争经历，因为那些创伤，那些不想再回忆起亲眼看着战友在我们眼前牺牲的场景，那些被爆炸声震得几乎失聪的日子，还有些人醒来时发现自己少了一条腿或一只手。战后多年，我试图通过埋头学习来忘却这一切，以为这样能让我摆脱痛苦……然而，战争的经历无法完全抹去，它已成为我的一部分，直到我生命的最后一刻。自从我开始在这里工作，我结识了许多朋友，他们几乎就像我的家人一样，所以在某种意义上，我更像是他们的父亲。但是，年轻人，如果他们受到伤害的威胁，或者我们面临的任何和平外交解决方案失败，我将毫不犹豫地再次拿起武器，为了他们和人类的利益，即使我已年迈。"

This time they were now in a command tent that was set up at the parking lot just outside the Pyramid.  
这次他们来到了一个设在金字塔外停车场上的指挥帐篷。

With his index finger, General Yamamoto had his finger on the digitized map, which was an LED touch-screen monitor set face-up on a table, pointing out positions where he laid over his plans for the initial defense of the Hakone area of operations (AO). Everyone else, including the Children, encircled the map, and around the perimeter of the tent, his staff began to set up their own equipment, and already two of his radiomen were busy working the electronics and communication gear to link up with troops here and aboveground.  
山本将军用食指在数字化地图上指点，这张 LED 触摸屏显示器平铺在桌上，他正指出计划中用于初期防御箱根作战区域（AO）的位置。其他人，包括孩子们，都围在地图旁，帐篷周围，他的参谋们开始架设自己的设备，已有两名无线电操作员忙于操作电子通信设备，与地面部队建立联系。

"First of all," Yamamoto said, his finger acting as a felt-tip marker, encircling friendly positions. "My naval colleague, Admiral Oshima, has just set his flotillas on either side of the Izu Peninsula, which will be our area of operations. This includes our best cruisers, guided missile destroyers, and attack submarines. Of course both cruisers and destroyers have full Aegis capability, armed with SM3 anti-ballistic missiles on ready within their VLS launchers, and in case there's an air attack, they also have surface-to-air missiles to intercept any enemy bogies."  
“首先，”山本说道，他的手指如同记号笔一般，圈出了友军的位置。“我的海军同僚，大岛 Admiral Oshima，刚刚在伊豆半岛两侧部署了他的舰队，这将是我们作战的区域。这包括我们最精良的巡洋舰、导弹驱逐舰和攻击潜艇。当然，巡洋舰和驱逐舰都具备完整的宙斯盾能力，配备了 SM3 反弹道导弹，随时待命于垂直发射系统（VLS）中，并且，若遭遇空中攻击，它们还装备有舰对空导弹，以拦截任何敌机。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Go on," he said.  
冬月点头道：“继续。”

Yamamoto now traced his finger inland. "In case the enemy punches through this first line of defense, any approaches into the valley will be heavily defended, with tanks and troops to block such incursions. The enemy will also be harassed with our gunships and strike aircraft on call.  
山本现在用手指向内陆划去。“万一敌人突破了这第一道防线，任何进入山谷的途径都将受到重兵把守，坦克和部队将阻挡此类入侵。敌人还将受到我们的武装直升机和随时待命的攻击机的骚扰。”

"Should the approaches get overwhelmed," Yamamoto went on, "I have a ring of steel put around the city, with more than enough tanks and other combat vehicles to hold the enemy at bay until we could bring in more reinforcements. Again I have also set up anti-aircraft missile batteries to inhibit further use of airpower."  
“如果这些途径被压倒，”山本继续说道，“我已经在城市周围布下了钢铁防线，拥有足够多的坦克和其他战斗车辆来阻挡敌人，直到我们能调来更多增援。同样，我还设置了防空导弹电池，以抑制敌方进一步使用空中力量。”

"But what if they use an N2?" Misato asked.  
“但如果他们使用 N2 炸弹呢？”美里问道。

Yamamoto blinked. "Come again?"  
山本眨了眨眼。“再说一遍？”

"Assuming they know that the top of the Geofront has been weakened, they'll land an N2 to destroy our overhead protection, and then funnel everything they have right in here. They'll also assume that they'll do that way to ease their assault rather than bother with the car trains or the express elevators."  
“假设他们知道第三新东京市顶层已被削弱，他们会投放一枚 N2 炸弹来摧毁我们的顶层防护，然后将所有兵力直接引入这里。他们也会认为这样做是为了简化进攻，而不是费心去对付电车或高速电梯。”

This time the general blanched; a direct hit by an N2 at dead center of the lagoon would kill anyone within the blast radius roughly the same size as that of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima.  
这次将军脸色发白；N2 炸弹在湖中央直接命中，其爆炸半径内的人将会像广岛原子弹袭击时一样全部丧生。

"So, damn, looks like I'll have to redeploy everyone there out of the blast radius," Yamamoto said. He then took a pen and a pad placed near the digital map, jotting down notes for a while before gesturing to an aide, telling him to send out word via radio that his troops should get ready for repositioning.  
"该死，看来我得重新部署所有人离开爆炸半径，"山本说道。他随即拿起放在数字地图旁的一支笔和一个便签本，记了一会儿笔记，然后向副官示意，让他通过无线电传达命令，让部队准备重新定位。

"You want me to set up a trap?" Yamamoto questioned afterwards as he, using his index finger on the map, rearranged his units out of the designated Ground Zero. Anything he did on the map would automatically update the other maps used by commanders and even squad leaders under his responsibility.  
"你想让我设个陷阱？"山本随后问道，他用手指在地图上重新调整了自己的部队，使其远离指定的零点。他在地图上的任何操作都会自动更新其他指挥官甚至他下属的小队领导所使用的地图。

Misato nodded. "That's right, and just as Sun Tzu said, the best defense can be done deep into the bowels of the earth. They crash the party and we'll greet the bastards with a lot of firepower."  
美里点头道："没错，正如孙子所说，最好的防御可以深入地底。他们来砸场子，我们就用强大的火力迎接这些混蛋。

"Sounds good," Yamamoto said. "Do you have an idea about their capabilities?"  
"听起来不错，" 山本说。"你对他们的能力有什么了解吗？"

Hamamoto handed to his old friend a folder containing a full printout of the GPE order of battle. The general then spent a few minutes reviewing the contents, until he got a full picture.  
滨本递给他多年的朋友一个文件夹，里面包含了 GPE 作战序列的完整打印件。将军花了几分钟时间审阅内容，直到他有了全面的了解。

The general laid down the folder and said, "Damn, these bastards are really up ahead as far as technological capabilities are concerned."  
将军放下文件夹，说道："该死，这些混蛋在技术能力方面确实领先很多。"

"They still have a flaw," Misato said.  
"他们还有一个缺陷，"美里说。

"And what is it?"  
"那是什么？"

"Well… If they depend too much on their technology, they get blind over time, and when they do, they're easy pickings."  
"嗯……如果他们过于依赖自己的技术，久而久之就会变得盲目，而一旦如此，他们就很容易被击溃。"

"And then where would the Evas figure in this plan?" Yamamoto asked.  
"那么，这个计划中 EVA 将扮演什么角色？" 山本问道。

"We'll be anticipating not just a massive conventional assault, but those Mass-Production models," Misato answered. "Wherever they'll come from, we'll have to kill them, too."  
"我们不仅要预料到大规模的传统攻击，还有那些量产机型，" 美里回答道。"无论它们从哪里来，我们都必须消灭它们。"

"What danger they'll pose then?"  
"那时它们会构成什么威胁？"

"These enemy Evas have the potential to start Third Impact," Ritsuko said. "They're very far ahead of us, each having a working S2 Engine and a Dummy Plug… But other than that, we're not sure about their exact capabilities and limitations, just guesstimates."  
“这些敌对 EVA 有可能引发第三次冲击，”律子说道，“它们远远领先于我们，每台都配备了运作中的 S2 引擎和模拟插入栓……但除此之外，我们对它们的确切能力和限制并不清楚，只是一些猜测。”

---

Kaworu wanted to say something, but even he, being the only one directly out of SEELE command, had no idea about the true destructive extent of the MPs, for Keel kept him in the dark and was only fed with small tidbits about their construction.  
渚薰本想说什么，但即便他是唯一直接受命于 Seele 的人，也不了解量产机的真正破坏力，因为基尔对他保密，只透露了关于它们构造的零星信息。

"Mister Nagisa?" Yamamoto asked.

This brought Kaworu out of his thoughts and made him blinking. "I beg your pardon, sir?"  
这打断了渚薰的思绪，让他眨了眨眼。“您说什么，先生？”

"You're the only one who used to be under SEELE control," the general questioned. "Care to tell us if you know anything else about SEELE's Eva program?"  
"你是唯一一个曾受 SEELE 控制的人，"将军质问道，"愿意告诉我们你是否还知道 SEELE 的 Eva 计划的其他信息吗？"

"About the only knowledge I have is that the Dummy Plug programming is very advanced," he said. "If I say advanced, I say it's brutal and unforgiving because they will destroy their opponents in less than two minutes. I know this because Lorenz gave me an opportunity to observe the Plugs in action, in a simulation where they were directed to attack Angels and… Evas."  
"我所知甚少，只知道 Dummy Plug 程序非常先进，"他说，"我所说的先进，是指它残酷无情，因为它们能在不到两分钟内摧毁对手。我知道这一点是因为 Lorenz 给了我一个机会，让我观察这些 Plug 在模拟中攻击天使和……Eva 的情况。"

"Is there a way to defeat them?" Yamamoto asked.  
"有什么办法能击败它们吗？"山本问道。"

"To kill them is to target their cores, but because of their overall construction, they're very agile, which means they will be hard to neutralize."  
“要消灭它们，必须瞄准核心，但由于其整体构造，它们非常灵活，这意味着很难将其中和。”

"But, hey, how could we practice against them?" Asuka asked. "You said that they have your thought patterns, which means they're supposedly smart as you are."  
“但是，嘿，我们怎么能练习对付它们呢？”明日香问道，“你说过它们有你的思维模式，那就意味着它们应该和你一样聪明。”

Kaworu looked noncommittal. "That's right, I'm afraid."  
渚薰看起来不置可否。“恐怕是这样。”

Asuka then turned to Ritsuko, who was listening most of the time, and said, "Say, why can't we hook him up to some machine and try out?"  
明日香随后转向大部分时间都在倾听的律子，说道：“我说，我们为什么不把他连接到某个机器上试试呢？”

"You mean a direct neural link from an Entry Plug? It's possible," Ritsuko said. "But it's never been done before."  
“你是说直接从插入栓进行神经连接？这有可能，”律子说，“但以前从未有人尝试过。”

"Give it a shot," Asuka said. "You're the genius in charge, Doc. You can make things happen: just put Kaworu in a Plug, run a neural link onto him, use his thought patterns in real time to simulate a DP so that we can have opponents to practice on in the simulator."  
“试试看吧，”明日香说，“你是负责的天才，博士。你能让事情发生：只要把渚放进插入栓，运行神经连接到他，利用他的实时思维模式来模拟一个 DP，这样我们就能在模拟器中有对手练习了。”

Ritsuko nodded, but then smiled. "Okay, that's a smart idea, Asuka," she said. "We'll try it out after lunch, but we'll also have to wait for the Evas to finish the regeneration process."  
律子点点头，随即微笑道：“好吧，这是个聪明的想法，明日香。”她说，“我们午饭后试试，不过还得等 EVA 完成再生过程。”

"I see," Asuka said.

"So what you people can arm the Evas with?" Yamamoto asked instead.  
“那你们能给 EVA 装备什么武器？”山本反问道。

The scientist pulled her hardened laptop towards, and fed a few commands. "Let's see… We still have our Pallet rifles and hand guns, along with the necessary ammunition, and then a couple of sniper rifles and a Positron cannon… but those are too useless and slow in a fast, close-in engagement. We do have hand-held melee weapons, though, but there are also special weapons still in the prototype stage."  
科学家将她的坚固笔记本拉近，输入了几条指令。“让我们看看……我们还有调色板步枪和手枪，以及必要的弹药，还有几把狙击步枪和一把阳电子炮……但在快速近距离交战中，这些都太没用且缓慢了。不过，我们确实有手持近战武器，还有一些仍处于原型阶段的特殊武器。”

Asuka and Shinji's eyes widened. "Really?" both of them questioned in unison.  
明日香和真嗣的眼睛睁大了。“真的吗？”两人异口同声地问道。

Ritsuko sighed, realizing she caught herself too late. "All right, so I got the rabbit out," she said. "We have four Pallet submachine guns patterned after the Fabrique National P-90 weapons, their design chosen for their ease of control and compactness; to save weight, more than 85 percent of their construction is mostly made of composite aerospace material."  
律子叹了口气，意识到自己说漏嘴太晚了。“好吧，我承认我泄露了秘密，”她说道，“我们有四把仿制法布里克国家 P-90 的 Pallet 冲锋枪，其设计因其易于操控和紧凑性而被选中；为了减轻重量，超过 85%的构造主要由复合航空材料制成。”

She turned the laptop around to show the Children the pictures of the submachine guns, the grips built into the frame system.  
她将笔记本电脑转过来，向孩子们展示冲锋枪的图片，握把集成在框架系统中。

"They also use the same ammo as the Pallet rifles, by the way," Ritsuko said, before pressing another key to open a new picture, this time what appears to be a six-barrel Gatling machine gun, except as it was stored in a special cradle, the heavy weapon dwarfed a trailer truck parked in front of it.  
“顺便说一句，它们使用的弹药与 Pallet 步枪相同，”律子说道，随后按下另一个键，打开了一张新图片，这次显示的是一把六管加特林机枪，只是它被存放在一个特制的支架中，这重型武器使得前方停放的拖车卡车显得矮小。

"We were supposed to deploy this weapon a couple of months ago, but a design flaw in both the mechanism and the internal powerplant forced us to make corrections. Right now, it's still serviceable but hasn't been fired before. Like the SMGs, this weapon can use standard Pallet ammo."  
“我们本应在几个月前部署这件武器，但由于机械和内部动力装置的设计缺陷，迫使我们进行了修正。目前，它仍可使用，但尚未进行过实弹射击。与冲锋枪一样，这件武器可以使用标准的 Pallet 弹药。”

An aide walked over to Yamamoto and whispered something into his ear, while handing over a scribbled note. The general nodded, and he turned to his audience.  
一名助手走到山本身边，低声对他说了几句，并递给他一张潦草的便条。将军点点头，转向他的听众。

"Our American counterparts are feeling the heat just as we do," Yamamoto said. "Right now they're under a state of red alert, meaning to say all of their bases across the country aren't going to sit on this, with their units armed and ready for this contingency, having set their ships to sea and flying fighter patrols. Seems that even their President has taken your message pretty seriously, despite heavy opposition."  
"我们的美国同行同样感受到了压力，"山本说。"目前他们处于红色警戒状态，这意味着他们全国的基地都不会坐视不管，各部队已武装待命，舰船出海，战机执行巡逻任务。看来即使面临强烈反对，他们的总统也认真对待了你的信息。"

The senior officers nodded in agreement.  
高级军官们点头表示同意。

"So what other potential threats we could encounter?" the general asked.  
"那么我们可能还会遇到哪些潜在威胁？"将军问道。"

"We cannot discount the possibility of a hacking attempt," Ritsuko said. "Right now my division is working on several ways to neutralize such intrusions, and as you know, the MAGI is an irresistible target. Aoba and the rest of the programming team is working on the firewall code, but later I'll add a few more tricks of my own."  
"我们不能排除黑客攻击的可能性，" 律子说。"目前我的部门正在研究几种方法来阻止这种入侵，正如你所知，MAGI 是一个不可抗拒的目标。青叶和编程团队的其他人正在编写防火墙代码，但稍后我会加入一些我自己的小技巧。"

"You know what threats we might encounter on that side?"  
"你知道我们可能会在那边遇到什么威胁吗？"

"It's unfortunate that we can't contact our overseas branches, which means they have been compromised, and as they possess MAGI copies and also heavily secured and fortified, with nothing coming in or out, I'm sure SEELE would use them to lay siege on our networks."  
"遗憾的是，我们无法联系海外分支机构，这意味着它们已经被攻陷，而且它们拥有 MAGI 的副本，并且高度安全加固，没有任何信息进出，我确信 SEELE 会利用它们来攻击我们的网络。"

"Anything has a Plan B, so what last-ditch resort do you have?"  
"任何事情都有 B 计划，那你最后的手段是什么？"

"On my command, the Section Two boys will blow up the land-lines. That'll leave us with nothing but satellite communications, and if the dish farm falls, we'll switch to data packet radio."  
"我一声令下，二组的伙计们会炸掉有线通讯线路。这样我们就只能依赖卫星通信了，如果卫星天线阵列失效，我们就切换到数据包无线电。"

"You sure all that are EMP-hardened?"  
"你确定这些都能抵御电磁脉冲吗？"

Ritsuko nodded. "Because we tend to work with unusual biological anomalies, and therefore could produce all sorts of stupid pet tricks, yes, we make sure our equipment are up to spec and can withstand anything… But as much as we try to be careful, there's always Murphy's Law."  
律子点头道：“因为我们经常处理不寻常的生物异常现象，因此可能会搞出各种愚蠢的宠物把戏，没错，我们确保设备符合规格，能够承受任何情况……但尽管我们尽力小心，墨菲定律总是存在的。”

"Otherwise if we lose the techno-thingamajigs," Director Hamamoto interjected, "all we could make do for comms is Morse Code."  
“否则如果我们丢了那些高科技玩意儿，”滨元主任插话道，“我们只能用摩尔斯电码来通讯了。”

---

They were now gathered around inside the holographic communications room, sitting before a circular table that formed halves of a ring.  
他们现在聚集在全息通信室内，围坐在一张形成半环形的圆形桌子前。

A meter from this cluster, Keel had his own table, complete with a pitcher of water and a glass, a pen and a pad for which to write on, and a red secure telephone.  
离这群人一米远的地方，基尔有自己的桌子，配备了一壶水和一只玻璃杯，一支笔和一个用来写字的便签本，还有一部红色的安全电话。

Through special visors, his eyes scanned the faces of the council members, dressed in the same robes as he wore, each one of them ready to listen as witnesses, each alone had the absolute power to affect events in their own countries or even a portion of the world, commanding scores of loyalists who believed that their way is the best and for the good of many.  
透过特殊的护目镜，他的目光扫过身穿与他相同长袍的议会成员们的面孔，每个人都准备好倾听证言，每个人单独都拥有绝对权力影响自己国家甚至世界某部分的事件，指挥着众多忠诚者，他们坚信自己的方式是最好的，为了多数人的利益。

At this moment, Keel had the entire council assembled, for he wanted to confer with Gendo Ikari for the last time, to deliver the final ultimatum, not knowing that his former protégé had been deposed by his teacher.  
此刻，基尔召集了整个议会，因为他想最后一次与碇源堂商议，传达最终通牒，却不知他的前门生已被他的老师罢黜。

Thirty minutes ago Keel issued orders to activate sleeper agents, to begin the process of countermanding any attempts to locate their whereabouts, or enact an armed response, or at least delay the inevitable. Right now the UN General Secretary was one of those agents, as he, through a press secretary, denied the claims made by the not-so-secret Antarctica footage, calling the video as nothing but the work of conspiracy theorists; the same man also transmitted a notice that effective immediately they have disassociated themselves from NERV, now a fugitive organization considered dangerous.  
三十分钟前，基尔下达了激活潜伏特工的命令，开始反制任何试图定位他们位置、实施武力反击或至少延缓不可避免的行动。此刻，联合国秘书长就是其中一名特工，他通过新闻发言人否认了那些不甚秘密的南极洲视频所提出的指控，称该视频不过是阴谋论者的作品；同时，这位秘书长还传达了一则通知，即刻起他们已与 NERV 断绝关系，NERV 现被视为危险逃犯组织。

Well, Keel thought, the more chaos, the merrier, that the ensuing confusion and in-fighting among the leaders of the world would take the heat away from SEELE.  
基尔心想，混乱越多越好，世界领导人之间的混乱和内斗会将注意力从 SEELE 身上转移开。

With the snap of his fingers, Keel saw the room lights fade away, covering them in darkness, before he could hear the faint sounds of the modem engage, making contact with NERV's holo-com room through a secure line via satellite.  
随着他打了个响指，基尔看到房间灯光逐渐熄灭，四周陷入黑暗，随后他听到了调制解调器启动的微弱声响，通过卫星安全线路与 NERV 的全息通讯室建立联系。

Just as Fuyutsuki was about to tell everyone that it was time to break for lunch, having glanced at his watch, hands almost close to noon, one of the phones connected from the tent to the command center rang, prompting the duty officer to pick up the phone and gestured to General Yamamoto to turn on the speakerphone.  
正当冬月准备告诉大家该休息吃午饭了，他瞥了一眼手表，时间已近正午，帐篷与指挥中心连接的一部电话突然响起，值班军官随即接起电话，并示意山本将军打开扬声器。

"Yes?' Fuyutsuki asked as everyone else listened in.  
“喂？”冬月问道，其他人则静听。

"This is Aoba, and I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir." Shigeru replied. "We have an incoming transmission from the holo-com room, and they're waiting for you."  
“我是青叶，很抱歉打扰您，长官。” 斯格鲁回复道，“我们收到了来自全息通讯室的传入通讯，他们在等您。”

"Who's there?"

"According to the ID… It's Chairman Lorenz of the Instrumentality Committee."  
"根据 ID 显示……这是人类补完委员会的洛伦兹主席。"

While everyone looked surprised, slowly Fuyutsuki turned to Shinji, who seemed to be sharing the same thoughts as he was, and the old professor understood by nodding.  
尽管众人面露惊讶，渐渐地，冬月转向了真嗣，后者似乎与他有着同样的想法，老教授通过点头表示理解。

"Politely tell that old bum to wait," he said. "We'll be there immediately."  
"礼貌地告诉那个老家伙稍等，""他说，""我们马上就到。"

"Yes, sir," Shigeru said before putting down the phone.  
“是的，先生，” 四郎说完后放下了电话。

After a moment of silence, Fuyutsuki looked into the faces of his subordinates, and to Shinji, the old professor staring at the Third Children with determined eyes, almost quietly he said, "You're coming with me."  
沉默片刻后，冬月看向他的下属们，对真嗣来说，这位老教授用坚定的眼神凝视着第三适格者，几乎悄声地说：“你跟我来。”

**Author's Notes:** I've been taking time to write this chapter to prepare the characters for the inevitable face-off, as I wanted to provide the last two End of Eva episodes an added stretch.  
作者笔记：我一直在花时间撰写这篇chapter，为不可避免的对决做准备，因为我希望为最后两集《EVA 终》增添一些延展。

The good news is that I now have more time to brainstorm than ever before, and at the same time I've been watching movies and reading books again to get more story ideas, so the tentative working title for the next chapter, at least for the time being, _Auguries of Innocence._  
好消息是我现在有比以往更多的时间来集思广益，同时我又开始看电影和读书以获取更多故事灵感，因此下一部《一千零一夜》的暂定工作标题，至少目前来说，是《纯真预言》。

I want to finish this and I will as promised. Thank you for keeping the faith.  
我想完成这个，并且我会如承诺的那样完成。感谢你们保持信念。

The holographic communications room was completely dark, save for a couple of dim lights, and only Shinji was alone with a couple of folding chairs and a table in the middle, waiting for a man he never met before, but shrouded in tales of mystery and conspiracy.  
全息通讯室内一片漆黑，只有几盏昏暗的灯光，只有真嗣独自一人，身边是几把折叠椅和中间的一张桌子，等待着一个他从未谋面，却笼罩在神秘与阴谋传说中的男人。

Perhaps this Chairman Lorenz, as Shinji contemplated, a man unimaginably ruthless, a villain in the truest sense of the word, like a caricature of spy movies in which such a villain, dapper in a three-piece suit and standing tall, had unimaginable amount of resources and capable of mobilizing an army of minions.  
或许这位洛伦兹主席，正如真嗣所思索的，一个难以想象的冷酷之人，一个真正意义上的恶棍，就像间谍电影中的夸张角色，穿着三件套西装，气宇轩昂，拥有难以估量的资源，并能调动一支庞大的手下队伍。

Or does he resemble the usual evil demented genius, dressed in a lab coat, cackling in laughter, with madness in his eyes?  
还是说他更像那种常见的邪恶疯狂天才，身着实验室白大褂，发出狂笑，眼中闪烁着疯狂？

He wasn't sure, but he hoped neither of those stereotypes, and all he understood about this man, whom he had never met in his entire life, was his frightening capacity to influence world decisions and alter the fate of nations.  
他不确信，但他希望这两种刻板印象都不是，他一生中从未见过此人，他所了解的仅是这个男人令人恐惧的影响世界决策和改变国家命运的能力。

Or judging from what Kaji divulged earlier in his post-mortem video.  
或者说，根据加治在事后分析视频中透露的信息来判断。

Instead, he remembered the last few words of instruction from Commander Fuyutsuki, that he should keep calm, stand firm, watch his tongue and every move he made, for all eyes would be upon him in a few seconds.  
相反，他想起了指挥官冬月最后的几句指示，他应该保持冷静，坚定立场，谨言慎行，因为几秒钟后所有的目光都将集中在他身上。

And indeed they appeared right before him, smooth and shiny black monoliths, with blazing red digits for eyes, all labeled with the same name: SEELE, encircling him like huge slabs of Stonehenge; their sudden arrival startled the young man.  
确实，它们就这样出现在他面前，光滑闪亮的黑色巨石，眼睛是炽热的红色数字，全都标着同一个名字：SEELE，像巨大的巨石阵一样环绕着他；它们的突然出现让年轻人吃了一惊。

There was a moment of silence, as they seem to size him up with invisible eyes, gazing him from head to toe, before a deep voice rang out from the monolith marked as SEELE 01.  
有那么一刻的沉默，他们似乎用无形的目光打量着他，从头到脚审视一番，随后一个深沉的声音从标有 SEELE 01 的巨石中响起。

"It is my pleasure to see you," SEELE 01 said. "I presume that you are Shinji Ikari, the Third Children and the pilot of Unit One?"  
"见到你很荣幸，" SEELE 01 说道。"我猜你就是碇真嗣，第三适格者，初号机的驾驶员？"

"Yes, sir," Shinji answered.  
"是的，先生，" 真嗣回答道。

SEELE 01 cleared his throat. "And where is your father, Commander Gendo Ikari? We insist that he should be here as well."  
SEELE 01 清了清嗓子。“你的父亲，指挥官碇源堂在哪里？我们坚持要求他也必须到场。”

"I'm sorry," the young man said, shaking his head. "He can't come."  
“很抱歉，”年轻人摇了摇头说，“他来不了。”

"What do you mean?" SEELE 01 questioned.  
“你这是什么意思？”SEELE 01 质问道。

"I'm the one to be present here instead, and was told beforehand that you wanted to talk to me."  
"我才是应该在这里出现的人，而且事先被告知你想和我谈谈。"

"That is correct. We repeatedly requested for a direct audience with you, rather than your father as a representative… But, again, where is he?"  
"没错。我们多次请求直接与你本人会面，而不是作为代表的你父亲……但是，他又在哪里呢？"

"He's under arrest," Shinji said flatly.  
"他已经被捕了，" 真嗣平静地说道。"

Silence draped the room, as though the monoliths quickly engaged in muted conversation behind the scenes, before SEELE 01 grumbled again to disrupt.  
寂静笼罩着房间，仿佛那些巨石迅速在幕后低声交谈，随后 SEELE 01 再次咕哝着打断了一切。

"For what treason he had committed? That is good news, young man," the ancient voice said.  
“他犯了什么叛国罪？这可是好消息，年轻人，”那古老的声音说道。

"Good news? He needs to be protected from himself," Shinji replied.  
“好消息？他需要被保护，免受自己的伤害，”真嗣回答道。

"Then who is in charge this time? Fuyutsuki?"  
"那么这次是谁负责？冬月吗？"

Shinji nodded.

SEELE 01 cleared his throat again, and sighed.  
Seele 01 再次清了清喉咙，叹了口气。

"Very well, then," he said. "Rather than we demand that this Judas Iscariot, your stubborn and traitorous father, that is, be present, and as we are more than glad to see you in person instead, may I indulge you to reveal myself for our benefit?"  
"很好，那么，"他说道，"与其要求这个犹大·伊斯卡里奥特，也就是你那顽固且叛逆的父亲到场，我们更乐意见到你本人，请允许我为了大家的利益自我介绍一番？"

Shinji nodded.

SEELE 01 faded out into the digital darkness, before an apparition of a robed figure, somewhat squat in stature, came to appear in place of the monolith. He indeed looked more of an ancient wraith, a face wrinkled with age and white hair, and a crooked nose that jutted out, holding up on its bridge what seemed to be a huge electronic visor, making him a geriatric Cyclops, a thin electronic slit in place for a couple of eyes.  
SEELE 01 在数字黑暗中逐渐消失，取而代之的是一个身披长袍的身影，略显矮胖。他的确更像一个古老的幽灵，脸上布满岁月的皱纹，白发苍苍，还有一个弯曲的鼻子，鼻梁上架着一个巨大的电子护目镜，使他看起来像一个老迈的独眼巨人，护目镜上有一条细长的电子缝隙，代替了双眼。

This time Shinji was visibly surprised.  
这一次，真嗣明显感到惊讶。

"Who are you?" he asked.  
“你是谁？”他问道。

"It is both a blessing and a pity that we should meet for the first time and possibly also the last, young man," the elderly digital apparition said flatly, walking towards him.  
"初次见面，也可能是最后一次，年轻人，这既是幸运也是遗憾，" 那位年长的数字幽灵平静地说道，向他走来。

Shinji said nothing, as the old man stopped short of a couple of feet away, and stared down into his eyes.  
真嗣没有说话，老人在他面前几英尺处停下，低头凝视着他的眼睛。

"I am Keel Lorenz, Grand Master of SEELE."  
"我是基尔·洛伦兹，SEELE 的大师。"

It took a moment for Shinji to register the name of this old man, who was waiting for him to speak. But Keel seemed to read his mind, and said, "Relax, and it is all right that you should take a seat."  
碇真嗣花了片刻时间才反应过来这位老人的名字，他似乎在等待真嗣开口。但基尔伯特似乎看穿了他的心思，说道：“放松，你可以坐下。”

Shinji complied by pulling one of the chairs towards him and sat down.  
真嗣顺从地将一把椅子拉向自己并坐了下来。

This satisfied Keel. "Good," he said. "Now… where do we should start? Oh, yes, apart from the usual formal reports we receive from the field, we also have heard many wonderful stories from your father about your role as the Third Children."  
这让基尔感到满意。“很好，”他说，“那么…我们应该从哪里开始呢？哦，对了，除了我们通常从现场收到的正式报告外，我们还从你父亲那里听到了许多关于你作为第三适格者的精彩故事。”

Shinji merely nodded, nary a word.

"Of all Children, you have accomplished much in a very short time, despite that you had a rough start in the very beginning; you killed more Angels than two of your… Should I dare to say, your playmates?"  
“在所有适格者中，你在很短的时间内取得了许多成就，尽管一开始你经历了艰难的起步；你消灭的使徒数量超过了你的两位…我是否敢说，你的玩伴？”

The young man said nothing, which Keel took as a 'yes'.  
年轻人一言不发，基尔将其视为‘同意’。

"In any case, Shinji Ikari," Keel continued, "by your diligence, as well as by accident, you slowly unlocked the full potential of the Test Type, discovering her strengths and weaknesses, and whenever she is driven hard to a certain point, her ferocity is unleashed and nothing could withstand such raw, brutal power."  
“无论如何，碇真嗣，”基尔继续说道，“通过你的勤奋，以及偶然的机遇，你逐渐解锁了试验机型 EVA 的全部潜能，发现了她的强项与弱点，而每当她被逼至某个极限时，她的凶猛便会被激发出来，那种原始而残酷的力量无人能挡。”

From out of nowhere, Keel produced a cup full of tea, and he took the time to mix it with a spoon, tapping it to the side of the cup and laid it down onto the table. With Shinji watching him, the old man then took a sip for a moment.  
基尔不知从何处拿出了一杯满满的茶，他慢条斯理地用勺子搅拌，轻敲杯壁后将其放在桌上。在碇真嗣的注视下，老人随即抿了一口。

"For someone who is seemingly weak-willed, over time you have impressed us greatly with such personal progress," Keel praised. "We know this because we have eyes who have watched every move you made, observed your behavior on a daily basis, along with your eating patterns, the use of the toilet, and even how you socialize with youngsters of your age. Well, speaking of your friends, I gather that the Fourth Children punched you in the jaw?"  
“对于一个看似意志薄弱的人来说，随着时间的推移，你在个人进步上给我们留下了深刻的印象，”基尔赞许道，“我们知道这一点，因为我们有眼睛观察你的一举一动，每天观察你的行为，包括你的饮食习惯，上厕所的习惯，甚至你如何与同龄的年轻人交往。哦，说到你的朋友，我听说第四儿童打了你的下巴？”

That really surprised Shinji, but the fact also made him shiver within. "How do you know that much?"  
这让真嗣非常惊讶，但这个事实也让他内心发寒。“你怎么知道这么多？”

Keel shook his head as he put down the digitized cup on the table.  
基尔摇了摇头，将数字化杯子放在桌上。

"I told you we have eyes _everywhere_," he reminded. "Too bad, that friend of yours possessed great potential, but your father thought otherwise as he had you turn Unit Three into a slab of meat."  
"我告诉过你，我们的眼线无处不在，"他提醒道。"可惜了，你那位朋友本有大好前程，但你父亲却不这么认为，让你把三号机变成了肉块。"

"I didn't kill him!" Shinji objected, almost jumping out of his seat as if he was accused of murder in a trial. "That was the Dummy Plug!"  
"我没有杀他！"真嗣反驳道，几乎从座位上跳了起来，仿佛在法庭上被指控谋杀一般。"那是模拟插入栓干的！"

"We know that already," Keel said nonchalantly, personally amused that he finally got Shinji off his rocker. "Be happy that Mister Suzuhara had the great fortune to survive such excruciating brutality. Now let me get to the point."  
"我们早就知道了，"基尔轻描淡写地说，私下里对终于让真嗣失去冷静感到好笑。"庆幸铃原先生有幸从如此残酷的折磨中生还吧。现在让我直奔主题。"

Shinji was fuming as he sat down again, but begrudgingly he nodded.  
真嗣再次坐下时气得要命，但还是不情愿地点了点头。

"You are a very important young man, more than anybody on this fragile planet," Keel said. "You are not aware of it before, only that today we shall disclose to you a great secret."  
“你是一个非常重要的年轻人，比这个脆弱星球上的任何人都重要，”基尔说。“你之前并不知道这一点，只是今天我们将向你揭示一个伟大的秘密。”

The young man blinked repeatedly. "A secret?"  
年轻人眨了眨眼。“一个秘密？”

"Your mother, Yui Ikari Saint-Clair, is no ordinary woman."  
"你的母亲，碇唯·伊卡里·圣克莱尔，绝非寻常女子。"

"Why? Yes, Mother seemed to be so important to you people," Shinji answered.  
"为何如此？是的，母亲对你们这些人来说似乎非常重要，" 真嗣回答道。"

"Precisely," Keel said as several pictures of Yui Ikari appeared from thin air, flanking around his head like leaves. "She helped us in the early days, but your mother was such a fierce character that her brilliant yet rebellious attitude could be our undoing, and hence we planned to have her assassinated. Yet it seems that she was one step ahead of us, and in doing so she assimilated herself into Unit One… What a smart woman you have for a mother."  
"确实如此，" 基尔说着，几张碇唯的照片凭空出现，环绕在他头部周围，宛如叶片。"她在初期给予了我们帮助，但你的母亲个性刚烈，她那卓越却叛逆的态度可能会成为我们的隐患，因此我们计划暗杀她。然而，她似乎总是快我们一步，通过这种方式，她将自己融入了一号机……你有一位多么聪慧的母亲啊。"

"And what do you know of her?"  
"你对她的了解有多少？"

"Are you familiar with the Bible?"  
"你熟悉《圣经》吗？"

Shinji shook his head. "No."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"不熟悉。"

"What about the history of France?"  
"法国的历史呢？"

"I have no idea," the young man said.  
"我完全不知道，"年轻人说。

"Your ignorance is forgivable," Keel said while circling the young man. "Only a small percentage of your countrymen are practicing Christians, and that your junior high school curriculum doesn't touch much on world history, but to begin with, your mother is of mixed parentage, a Japanese mother—"  
"你的无知是可以原谅的，"基尔一边绕着年轻人转圈一边说。"你的同胞中只有一小部分是实践基督徒，而且你的初中课程对世界历史的涉及不多，但首先，你的母亲是混血儿，一个日本母亲——"

"And a French father," Shinji added. "Kaji said so."  
"还有个法国父亲，" 真嗣补充道。"加持是这么说的。"

Keel blinked behind his visors. "Are you sure? I didn't know that he survived to tell."  
基尔在他面罩后眨了眨眼。"你确定吗？我没想到他还能活下来告诉我们。"

"He's dead, no thanks to you," Shinji said flatly. "But he left us a video, among many things, and there he spilled the beans, even many things I don't know about my parents. Until that time, I didn't even know that I had a French grandfather."  
"他已经去世了，这可不归功于你，" 真嗣平淡地说。"但他给我们留下了一段视频，还有许多其他东西，在那里他全盘托出了，包括许多我以前不知道的关于我父母的事情。直到那时，我甚至不知道自己有个法国外公。"

The old man chuckled in reaction to the boy's surprisingly stubborn character, the first time while being here.  
老人对男孩出乎意料的倔强性格轻声笑了起来，这是他在这里的第一次。

"The Saint-Clairs are a very old French family," Keel said. "They produced some of the most illustrious men and even women in history, and if we go further down the family tree, their importance becomes very obvious, for they came from the royal house called the Merovingian."  
“圣克莱尔家族是一个非常古老的法国家族，”基尔说，“他们孕育了历史上一些最杰出的人物，甚至包括女性。如果我们再深入家族树，他们的重要性就变得非常明显，因为他们来自被称为墨洛温的皇室家族。”

Shinji looked surprised. "What?"  
真嗣看起来很惊讶。“什么？”

"They were the first royal family of France," Keel said. "Before a traitor among their ranks brought them down and usurped their power. Still, what was far more important about this dynasty is the woman who first brought the bloodline into that country."  
"他们是法国的第一任王室家族，"基尔说。"在他们之中的一位叛徒将他们推翻并篡夺了权力之前。然而，这个王朝更重要的意义在于，那位将血脉引入该国的女性。"

"And who's she? What's the connection between me and her?"  
"她是谁？我和她之间有什么联系？"

Keel smiled lightly. _"Mary Magdalene,"_ he said. "Do you want me to explain more about your heritage?"  
基尔微微一笑。"玛丽·玛德琳，"他说。"你想让我进一步解释你的血统吗？"

---

It was widely accepted by most people that Mary Magdalene was a common prostitute, prior to her first encounter with Jesus Christ, in which she provided him the service of anointing His feet with the ointment of spikenard, before using her hair to wipe His soles. Afterwards she became one of Jesus' first female disciples.  
大多数人普遍认为，抹大拉的玛利亚在初次遇见耶稣基督之前是个普通的妓女，她为耶稣提供了用甘松香油膏涂抹他脚的服务，随后用自己的头发擦拭他的脚底。之后，她成为了耶稣最早的女性门徒之一。

However, further investigation by contemporary historians and scholars, after much study of the times as well as reading carefully the passages of the Bible in which Magdalene was mentioned in brought out a completely different light: instead of being an impoverished prostitute, as the early Church fathers ever since the Council of Nicaea had decided on in rewriting her role in Jesus' life by defaming the woman, Magdalene was really a member of a very powerful tribe called the Tribe of Benjamin, which had royal pedigree, and as such the woman had considerable influence, quite unusual in her day when men predominated society.  
然而，当代历史学家和学者经过深入研究那个时代并仔细阅读圣经中提到玛利亚的章节后，揭示了一个完全不同的真相：玛利亚并非早期教会领袖自尼西亚会议以来所描绘的贫穷妓女，而是来自一个非常强大的部落——便雅悯部落，该部落拥有王室血统，因此她在当时男性主导的社会中拥有相当大的影响力，这实属罕见。

More amazingly, it seems that she was destined to cross paths with Jesus, whose lineage could be traced back to the House of David (of which King Solomon was David's successor but the last).  
更令人惊奇的是，她似乎注定要与耶稣相遇，耶稣的血统可以追溯到大卫王家族（其中所罗门王是大卫的继承人，但也是最后一位）。

Already as Jesus was acquiring popularity with the masses while preaching, it became clear that He could pave the way of reclaiming Israel from the occupying Romans, and establishing a new kingdom, and for such a revival, why can't a King have a Queen?  
就在耶稣布道期间逐渐赢得民众喜爱之时，人们开始意识到，他有能力为从罗马占领者手中夺回以色列、建立新王国铺平道路。既然如此，为何国王不能有一位王后呢？

Conventional dogma (with history rewritten by the early Church fathers) viewed Jesus as a celibate, but in reality, it was considered a grave sin (by Jewish standards) in His time to stay single, and hence it was the duty of a father to obtain an appropriate wife for his son. In this case, Magdalene of the Tribe of Benjamin was a very smart choice, unifying both royal lineages in marriage that could possibly bring about the liberation of Israel.  
传统教义（由早期教会神父改写历史）将耶稣视为独身者，但实际上，在他那个时代，保持单身被视为严重的罪行（按照犹太标准），因此父亲有责任为儿子物色一位合适的妻子。在这种情况下，本杰明部落的玛格达琳是一个非常明智的选择，通过婚姻统一了两个可能带来以色列解放的皇室血统。

But it wasn't meant to be, for the corrupt Roman regime under the reign of Pontius Pilate saw Jesus' rise to fame as a threat, and in trying to take down the coming revolution, it took a bribe to turn a disciple to betray Him. Furthermore, not all the disciples were happy with Magdalene joining their ranks, as in the case of Peter, who hoped he could carry on Jesus' mission to evangelize the world and spread His word, but instead Jesus entrusted Magdalene to continue His ministry even after death, conferring upon her an enormous amount of authority more than Peter.  
但这一切并未如愿，因为在彼拉多统治下的腐败罗马政权视耶稣的名声为威胁，为了镇压即将到来的革命，不惜贿赂门徒背叛他。此外，并非所有门徒都对抹大拉的玛利亚加入他们感到高兴，比如彼得，他本希望自己能继承耶稣的使命，向世界传福音、传播他的教诲，但耶稣却将玛利亚托付于死后的传道工作，赋予她比彼得更大的权威。

Whereas in most histories Magdalene disappeared, for a few it was assumed that for safety reasons she embarked on a journey to what would later become southern France, eventually settling in a Jewish community with her newborn, now named Sarah, which allowed her to begin with a fresh new start by preaching the Word.  
在大多数历史记载中，玛利亚销声匿迹，但有少数记载认为，出于安全考虑，她踏上了前往未来法国南部的旅程，最终在一个犹太社区定居，与新生女儿萨拉一起，得以重新开始，宣讲福音。

From Magdalene and Sarah, it took decades of near-obscurity for the fledgling bloodline to wait, until by the fifth century one of its members intermarried with early French royalty, creating the Merovingian dynasty. From this new lineage, they founded Paris, and held sway over most of the country until King Dagobert was taken down by the Vatican by colluding with Pepin d'Heristal.  
从玛格达莱娜和莎拉开始，这个新兴血脉在近乎默默无闻中等待了数十年，直到五世纪时，其中一位成员与早期的法国王室通婚，创立了墨洛温王朝。从这条新血脉中，他们建立了巴黎，并统治了大部分国家，直到达戈贝尔国王被梵蒂冈与丕平·德·赫里斯坦勾结推翻。

The death of Dagobert nearly drove the bloodline extinct, except for a single heir, Sigisbert, who escaped unscathed; the young man survived long enough to continue the lineage, which produced noblemen, saints, warriors, and kings, all bearing either the surnames of Saint-Clair (or Sinclair, later to become nobles of Scotland) and Plantard, even as France went through tumultuous changes, including the Revolution that completely wiped out the Bourbon monarchy, including both world wars, until one member of the clan married a Japanese woman.  
达戈贝尔的死几乎使这条血脉灭绝，除了一个幸存的继承人西吉斯贝尔，他毫发无损地逃脱了；这位年轻人活了足够长的时间来延续血脉，这条血脉产生了贵族、圣徒、战士和国王，他们都带有圣克莱尔（或后来成为苏格兰贵族的辛克莱）和普兰塔德的姓氏，尽管法国经历了包括彻底推翻波旁王朝的大革命以及两次世界大战在内的动荡变化，直到该家族的一位成员娶了一位日本女性。

And springing from that union was Yui Ikari Saint-Clair.  
从那次联姻中诞生了绫波唯·圣克莱尔。

"Now," Keel said. "Do you understand how important you are? Do you believe in the truth we have imparted to you?"  
"现在，"基尔说。"你明白你有多重要了吗？你相信我们告诉你的真相吗？"

Both of them were now surrounded by a holographic wall consisting of images, scanned pages of ancient texts, diagrams, and other arcane and esoteric documentation needed to enlighten the young man.  
他们两人现在被一圈全息墙包围，墙上展示着图像、古代文本的扫描页、图表以及其他神秘而深奥的文献，这些都是为了让年轻人开悟所必需的。

"I… I can't say," Shinji said in his disbelief.  
"我……我说不上来，"真嗣难以置信地说。

Keel looked around, as if asking for approval from the other monoliths, and with the movements of his gnarly arms he drew open what looked to be a complex diagram from out of thin air, stretching a digitized square into shape as though unrolling a scroll.  
基尔环顾四周，仿佛在向其他巨石征求同意，随后他用那粗糙的手臂动作，从虚空中拉开了一幅看似复杂的图表，将一个数字化方块拉伸成形，宛如展开一幅卷轴。

"You see," Keel began, pivoting to face Shinji. "You are the latest in a very long lineage that began centuries ago, in a dusty country colonized by the Romans. A young man, supposedly a son of a carpenter and a common housewife, was in reality born into a very good noble family whose bloodline itself came from a royal house that was long subdued by other empires before the arrival of the Romans, and forced to live as commoners. Since then the weight of centuries have obscured their true secrets, layer upon layer of fantastic myth and legend as this young man's teachings became a great influence and legacy unprecedented in mankind."  
“你看，”基尔开始说道，转身面向真嗣。“你是这一漫长血脉的最新一代，其起源可追溯到数百年前，在一个被罗马人殖民的尘土飞扬的国家。一个年轻人，据说是木匠之子和普通家庭主妇的儿子，实际上出生于一个非常优秀的贵族家庭，其血统源自一个在罗马人到来之前被其他帝国长期压制并被迫以平民身份生活的王室。自那时起，几个世纪的重压掩盖了他们的真实秘密，一层又一层的奇幻神话和传说，因为这个年轻人的教诲对人类产生了前所未有的巨大影响和遗产。”

Shinji stared at the diagram, which was spangled with lines and boxes forming into a large tree, starting from the bottom, then expanding further in the middle, until reaching the very top.  
真嗣凝视着图表，上面点缀着线条和方框，形成了一棵大树，从底部开始，中间逐渐扩展，直到达到顶端。

With his name on it in Latin letters, and connected by a line was his mother's, enclosed in a box.  
上面用拉丁字母写着他的名字，并通过一条线与他的母亲相连，她的名字被框在一个方框里。

He then let his eye trace downwards, reading off obscure names, mostly written in a language he didn't know of, and suddenly he wished Asuka was here to help him decipher them, as he thought she knew different languages other than German or English, until he found the names at the very bottom of the tree:  
他随后让目光顺着往下扫，读着那些晦涩的名字，多数是用一种他不认识的语言写成，突然间他希望明日香在这里帮他解读，因为他记得她除了德语和英语外还懂其他语言，直到他在树的最底部找到了那些名字：

_Mary Magdalene + Jesus Christ  
玛丽·玛德琳 + 耶稣·基督_

"You are definitely of the royal blood," Keel said, letting the electronic scroll float slowly into the air. "_Sang Real_, if we want it to be formal, or if you like_,_ the _Holy Grail_."  
"你绝对是王室血脉，"基尔说，让电子卷轴缓缓飘浮在空中。"圣杯，如果我们想要正式一点的话，或者你喜欢，_就_是圣杯。"

"What?"

"You, Shinji Ikari," Keel went on, "the second coming that the Secret Dead Sea Scrolls have prophesized, a direct descendant from the house of David, who in turn came from Moses, Noah… and ultimately the original Adam. You are one of a few sacred components needed to complete our holy dream. You should feel honored for such immense importance, for being connected directly with the First Father."  
"你，碇真嗣，"基尔继续说道，"《死海古卷》中的秘密预言所指的第二次降临，大卫王家族的直系后裔，而大卫王又源自摩西、诺亚……最终追溯到最初的亚当。你是完成我们神圣梦想所需的少数神圣组成部分之一。你应该为如此重大的意义感到荣幸，因为你直接与第一位父亲相连。"

Shinji merely blinked.

"Why can't you?" Keel questioned, finding no relief in Shinji's face.  
"为什么你不能？"基尔问道，在真嗣的脸上找不到一丝宽慰。

"I don't feel honored…. More like you and your crazy people want to destroy the world," Shinji countered.  
"我并不感到荣幸……更像是你们这些疯狂的人想要毁灭世界，" 真嗣反驳道。

"I stand corrected, young man," Keel said, unperturbed by the 'crazy' label. "We want mankind to be raised to the ultimate meeting with God in death, and to make our long-standing hopes a reality, we want your help by taking part in this momentous event, something that your mother, I'm sorry to say, disapproved of and much to our displeasure."  
"我承认你说得对，年轻人，" 基尔说道，对“疯狂”这一标签毫不在意。"我们希望人类能在死亡中与上帝进行终极会面，为了实现我们长期以来的愿望，我们希望你能参与这一重大事件，遗憾的是，你的母亲对此并不赞同，这让我们颇为不悦。"

"And what good I could get from what you're talking about?"  
"你说的这些对我有什么好处呢？"

Keel nodded. "Good question," he said. "Do you desire to meet your mother again? Or to be able to converse with long-gone relatives that you were not able to see or even talk to? Or, if you want, to be able to talk to anyone as if every human is a kin to you?"  
基尔点了点头。“好问题，”他说。“你渴望再次见到你的母亲吗？或是能够与那些早已逝去的亲人交谈，那些你未曾见过甚至无法交谈的亲人？又或者，如果你愿意，能够与任何人交谈，仿佛每个人都是你的亲人？”

"But…" Shinji trailed off.  
"但是…" 真嗣话音渐弱。

"As if that is not enough, would you like to live in a world where pain or sadness or hate does not exist? Where you will have all the peace you want? And above all, do you wish to live forever, without knowing injury, sickness or death?"  
"仿佛这还不够，你是否愿意生活在一个没有痛苦、悲伤或仇恨的世界？在那里，你将拥有你想要的所有安宁？最重要的是，你是否希望永生，不知伤害、疾病或死亡？"

Now Shinji said nothing again.  
现在，真嗣再次沉默了。

"We offer you a choice, a choice that no one else can make true more than you," the old man went on. "You have the power, you can harness it, and you can turn our dreams into reality."  
"我们给你一个选择，一个只有你能实现的选择，"老人继续说道。"你有这个力量，你可以驾驭它，你可以将我们的梦想变为现实。"

"You must be talking about Unit One, right?" Shinji asked. "She's the 'power' you're going after."  
"你一定是在说第一使徒，对吧？" 真嗣问道。"她就是你们要找的'力量'。"

"That is right," Keel answered. "Would you like to do the things that you, in your mortal and powerless shell, could not do?"  
"没错，" 基尔回答。"你想不想做那些你作为凡人，无力之躯所做不到的事情？"

Slowly, Shinji held up both his hands, palms facing Keel, as if asking him to give a pause to ponder about the old man's words, letting all of them sink in.  
慢慢地，真嗣举起双手，掌心朝向基尔，仿佛在请求他暂停一下，让他好好思考这位老人的话，让这些话慢慢沉淀。

---

Try as he could but given his limited knowledge, Shinji could not imagine how he, just an ordinary boy within yearning for a normal life, be linked indelibly with royal blood and even considered a direct descendant of one of the most famous and inspirational men in human history.  
尽管他尽力尝试，但受限于有限的知识，真嗣无法想象自己，一个渴望平凡生活的普通男孩，如何会与王室血脉不可分割地联系在一起，甚至被认为是人类历史上最著名且鼓舞人心的伟人的直系后裔。

Furthermore, Keel seemed to be enticing him about the rewards of Instrumentality; if he did what they wanted, they promised that he could see his mother again.  
此外，基尔似乎在引诱他关于人类补完计划的好处；如果他按照他们的意愿行事，他们承诺他可以再次见到他的母亲。

It was overwhelming, really, the kind of preposterousness that his friends would either say _"Impossible!"_ or _"You got to be kidding me."_  
这真是令人难以置信，荒谬至极，他的朋友们要么会说“不可能！”要么会说“你在开玩笑吧。”

But if Lorenz was telling him the truth, and considering much influence he wielded, judging from his way of talking (and that the old man was capable of conversing fluently in Japanese, a good thing because Shinji could still barely understand English or Asuka's German) he wasn't making all that up like a piece of fiction.  
但如果洛伦兹说的是真的，考虑到他谈话中展现的影响力（以及那位老人能流利地用日语交流，这倒是件好事，因为真嗣对英语或明日香的德语仍只能勉强理解），他并非在编造一个虚构的故事。

Or maybe not, a massive fabrication designed to scare his wits or make him out as a fool.  
或者并非如此，这可能是一场巨大的谎言，旨在吓唬他或是让他显得愚蠢。

Or he was being coerced to do something wrong, like destroying the world as he feared.  
又或许他正被迫做些错事，比如毁灭世界，正如他所恐惧的那样。

Now he was confused.  
现在他感到困惑。

Yet a memory bubbled up into his mind, and he recalled watching a movie (he forgot its title, as it was a foreign war movie) in which one of the main characters, a general, talked about history:  
然而，一段记忆涌上心头，他想起了曾看过的一部电影（他忘了片名，因为是部外国战争片），其中一位主角，一位将军，谈到了历史：

_Only the victor can rewrite history, either with a sword, a gun or a pen, and the vanquished foe be erased from time and existence.  
唯有胜者能改写历史，无论是用剑、枪还是笔，败者则被时间与存在抹去。_

But, no, he will not let this man have his way, even if he promised that he could be godlike.  
但是，不，他不会让这个男人得逞，即使他承诺自己能变得神一般。

---

"Do you have more for us to say?" Keel asked after a minute, as though badgering him to speak. This brought out Shinji from his reverie.  
"你还有什么要对我们说的吗？" 基尔在片刻后问道，仿佛在催促他开口。这让真嗣从沉思中回过神来。

"I now have a lot of good reasons to respect Mom," Shinji spoke. "She joined your ranks so that she could try to stop you and your scheme, and if she failed there, I guess it's up to me to do whatever business she left off."  
"我现在有很多理由去尊敬妈妈，" 真嗣说道。"她加入你们的行列，是为了试图阻止你和你的阴谋，如果她失败了，我想就轮到我来完成她未竟的事业了。"

"You may dare, but listen," Keel said. "The promised time has come for us to fulfill that dream. We have lost the Spear of Longinus, which makes it impossible to use Lilith for Instrumentality, and that means you and Unit One, will be our deliverance to save mankind from his own pain, sins and imperfections. Through the saving grace of Instrumentality, there will be an infinite Paradise, and within this new Paradise all can be united again in true happiness."  
"你或许敢，但听我说，"基尔说道。"约定的时刻已经到来，我们要实现那个梦想。我们失去了朗基努斯之枪，这使得我们无法利用莉莉丝进行人类补完计划，这意味着你和初号机，将成为拯救人类脱离自身痛苦、罪恶和不完美的救赎。通过人类补完计划的救赎之恩，将会有一个无限的乐园，在这个新的乐园中，所有人都能在真正的幸福中再次团结。"

Keel looked up to the monoliths, as if asking that they should concur with him, and they spoke in booming deep voices:  
基尔抬头望向那些巨石碑，仿佛在请求它们的认同，它们以深沉的轰鸣声回应：

"_We have no intention of giving up our human forms simply to enter the Ark called Eva,"_ SEELE 09 said.  
"我们无意放弃人类的形态，仅仅为了进入名为 Eva 的方舟，" SEELE 09 说道。"

"_It is merely a rite of passage... To bring about the rebirth in those who are imprisoned,"_ SEELE 04 added.  
"这不过是一个过渡仪式...为了那些被囚禁者带来重生，" SEELE 04 补充道。

"_The fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth,"_ SEELE 10 interjected.  
"毁灭的命运也是重生的喜悦，" SEELE 10 插话道。

Satisfied with their replies, Keel said, "Try as you might to resist, child, but whatever your companions or supporters do will be futile resistance at best. Through our immeasurable power, there is nothing you can do except to comply with our wishes: surrender your arms and embrace Instrumentality."  
对他们的回答感到满意，基尔说："尽管你可能会试图抵抗，孩子，但无论你的同伴或支持者做什么，都不过是徒劳的抵抗。凭借我们无与伦比的力量，除了顺从我们的意愿——放下武器并接受人类补完计划——你别无选择。"

"This time, I'm not a fool anymore," Shinji said.  
"这次，我不再是个傻瓜了，" 真嗣说道。

Keel looked visibly surprised. "What?"  
基尔看起来明显吃了一惊。"什么？"

"Then perhaps you try telling that to us," a familiar yet defiant voice rang out of nowhere, until Kozo Fuyutsuki appeared from the shadows, walking into the light.  
"那么或许你可以试着告诉我们，" 一个熟悉却带着挑衅的声音不知从何处响起，直到高雄冬月从阴影中走出，步入光明。

"So, it is you, Commander Fuyutsuki," Keel said, now looking crossed. "_Herr Professor."_  
"原来是你，福音津基地指挥官，"基尔说道，现在看起来有些恼火。"教授先生。"

"Yes," Fuyutsuki answered flatly as he stood together with Shinji. "I am in command now, Chairman Lorenz, and this is of great concern for me as this is very important for Shinji, for him to know what sort of sham you're up to."  
"是的，"福音津平淡地回答，他与真嗣站在一起。"我现在是指挥官，洛伦兹主席，这对我来说非常重要，因为这对真嗣了解你们在搞什么鬼把戏至关重要。"

"You heard everything?" "你都听到了？"

Fuyutsuki nodded.

"I'm not the only one," he said, as others came walking in from the shadows, each sporting a determined expression on their faces: Asuka, Rei, Misato, Ritsuko, Maya, Director Hamamoto, General Yamamoto…  
"我不是唯一一个，"他说道，随着其他人从阴影中走出，每个人的脸上都带着坚定的表情：明日香、绫波、美里、律子、玛雅、Hamamoto 导演、Yamamoto 将军……

…and Kaworu Nagisa, whose unexpected coming took Keel by complete surprise for a second, shattering his composure.  
……还有渚薰，他的意外出现让基尔完全措手不及，打破了他的镇定。

"You are supposed to be _dead_, Tabris!" Keel exclaimed in outrage, his accusing finger shaking at the young Angel. "That is not what we wanted!"  
"你本该死了，塔布里斯！"基尔愤怒地喊道，他指责的手指颤抖着指向年轻的使徒。"那不是我们想要的！"

Kaworu shook his head. "Symbolically I died for it, but I have survived for a very good reason," he said.  
渚薰摇了摇头。“象征性地我为它而死，但我活下来有一个非常好的理由，”他说。

The Fifth Children then raised his hand, index finger extended, to digitally write a phrase in the space in front of him. They watched him write, using seemingly alien letters in an incomprehensible tongue unknown to the modern world, until it dawned upon Fuyutsuki, automatically translating it from Aramaic to Japanese, that it was a phrase made famous in the Bible, the one that finally told King Nebuchadnezzar that his number was up:  
第五适格者随后举起手，食指伸直，在面前的空间中数字式地书写了一个短语。他们看着他用着似乎是外星的字母，以一种现代世界无法理解的未知语言书写，直到冬月意识到，这自动从阿拉姆语翻译成日语的短语，是圣经中著名的那句话，最终告诉尼布甲尼撒王他的末日已到：

_MENE MENE TEKEL U-PHARSIN._

"I suppose you understand what that means, Chairman," Kaworu said in a calm voice. "Just I have finally understood my true purpose in this world."  
“我想您明白那意味着什么，主席，”渚薰平静地说。“正如我终于明白了自己在这个世界的真正目的。”

"And what made you think about that?" Keel demanded, but inwardly took the warning, translating them to as: _you have been measured, weighed and found wanting_.  
"是什么让你想到那一点的？"基尔质问道，但内心却接受了这一警告，将其理解为：你已被衡量、称重，并被发现有所不足。

Without a word, Rei walked towards Kaworu and gently took his hand.  
雷一言不发，走向薰，轻轻握住他的手。

"You're a very powerful man," Kaworu began. "But you're empty, and nobody's going to die for you and for your false hopes. As for Ikari, he thinks that this young woman is a tool, only an experiment to be used and disposed of afterwards, but no, she's not what you or Ikari think of."  
"你是一个非常强大的人，"薰开始说道，"但你内心空虚，没有人会为了你和你那虚假的希望而死。至于碇，他认为这个年轻女子只是一个工具，仅是一项实验，用完即可丢弃，但并非如此，她不是你们或碇所认为的那样。

"What nonsense are you talking about?"  
"你在胡说些什么？"

But Kaworu went on, paraphrasing a passage from _The Little Prince_, another one of his favorite books. "She's more important than any of your machinations or acts of deviousness and venality, that for the first time I discovered the best parts of her and that of mine, that I opened her heart, listened to anything she truly wanted to say, tried my best to protect and take care of her… because _she's my rose_."  
但渚继续说道，引用了一段《小王子》中的话，这是他最喜欢的另一本书。“她比你的任何阴谋诡计或狡诈贪婪都重要，这是我第一次发现她和我身上最美好的部分，我打开了她的心扉，倾听她真正想说的话，尽我所能保护和照顾她……因为她是我独一无二的玫瑰。”

"Again, you're such a romantic fool," Keel ridiculed.  
"你真是个浪漫的傻瓜，"基尔嘲笑道。"

"You may call us names," Rei said, breaking her silence for the first time. "You may threaten us, or ask that we should plea on our knees… But from what I have heard everything from you, Herr Lorenz, I say that _death gives birth to nothing._"  
"你可以给我们起绰号，"丽首次打破沉默说道，"你可以威胁我们，或者要求我们跪地求饶……但从我听到的你的一切言论，洛伦兹先生，我要说，死亡什么也孕育不出。"

At that very same moment, Keel was astonished by the firm yet familiar tone of the First Children's voice. Sure, it was his first time to see her in person, for she was Gendo's supposed pawn; a manufactured child created from the DNA of Yui Ikari, but never thought he lived to this day to hear this young woman talk as if Yui Ikari herself had finally returned in person, reincarnated in the body of this pale teenager.  
就在那一刻，基尔对第一适格者坚定而熟悉的声音感到惊讶。没错，这是他第一次亲眼见到她，她被认为是源堂的棋子；一个由碇唯的 DNA 制造出来的孩子，但他从未想过自己能活到今天，听到这个苍白的少女说话，仿佛碇唯本人终于亲自回归，转世在这个青少年的身体里。

The Chairman of the Human Instrumentality Project took a deep breath and recomposed himself, preparing to speak for the last time, but in an outraged tone.  
人类补完计划委员会主席深吸一口气，重新调整自己，准备最后一次发言，但语气中带着愤怒。

"Very well, then," Keel said to Rei, his face now in a stony expression. "If that is what you talk back to us, and assuming that you are Yui Saint-Clair in that mortal shell of yours… then prepare, you accursed heretics, to _die tomorrow_, that at the break of dawn, from land, sea and air you will be utterly annihilated by our arms until all of what is left of this place is a howling wilderness… all the while we achieve total Instrumentality!"  
“很好，那么，”基尔对丽说，脸上现出冷酷的表情。“如果你对我们如此顶嘴，并且假设你就是你那凡人之躯中的圣克莱尔·伊织……那么准备好吧，你们这些该死的异端，明天就死吧，破晓时分，我们将从陆地、海洋和空中彻底摧毁你们，直到这个地方只剩下一片荒芜……与此同时，我们将实现完全的融合！”

With that final word echoing, Keel and the monoliths vanished into the darkness, and then a few seconds later the lights came on.  
随着那最后一句话回荡，基尔和那些巨石消失在黑暗中，几秒钟后灯光亮起。

---

Still standing in the middle of the communications room and even with the rest of the council watching him, Keel tried to calm himself down by breathing in deeply, knowing that even the slightest hint of extreme emotion could trigger a problem within his system.  
仍然站在通讯室中央，尽管议会其他成员都在注视着他，基尔试图通过深呼吸来平复自己的情绪，他知道哪怕是最轻微的极端情绪也可能在他的系统中引发问题。

Helpfully an acolyte in robes came to him with a glass of water and a bottle of pills on a tray, as though he could be suffering from hypertension, but without warning the old man slapped away the tray, its contents smashing onto the floor.  
一位身着长袍的侍僧恰到好处地端着一杯水和一瓶药丸来到他面前，仿佛他正遭受高血压之苦，但出乎意料的是，老人一巴掌打翻了托盘，里面的东西摔落一地。

"But, Master…" the shaken acolyte said nervously as he picked up the debris.  
“但是，大师……”侍僧紧张地收拾着碎片，声音颤抖。

Keel glared at the acolyte, with his teeth clenched. "_Scheisse!_ I don't need it!" he hissed.  
基尔怒视着侍僧，咬牙切齿地说：“该死！我不需要这些！”他低声咆哮。

As if to calm him down, Evgenyi walked up to his friend and placed a hand on Keel's shoulder.  
仿佛要让他平静下来，叶甫根尼走上前，把手放在基尔的肩膀上。

"My friend," Evgenyi said. "Take it easy."  
“我的朋友，”叶甫根尼说，“放松点。”

"I'm trying… Damn that Nagisa. Damn them all…" Keel cursed between breaths.  
“我正在努力……该死的渚，该死的他们所有人……”基尔喘着气咒骂道。

Evgenyi nodded. "I know, but please give yourself a breather," he said before turning to the rest of the council. "I insist that we should be left alone."  
叶夫根尼点点头。“我知道，但请让自己喘口气，”他说完转向议会的其他人。“我坚持我们应该独自留下。”

Understanding this, everyone else went out of the room until there was only Keel and Evgenyi, and it took some minutes before the German was able to regain his composure.  
明白了这一点，其他人陆续离开了房间，直到只剩下基尔和叶夫根尼，过了几分钟，这位德国人才恢复了镇定。

"Why do you need to be angry when we still have the advantage?" Evgenyi asked.  
“我们仍有优势，你为何需要生气？”叶夫根尼问道。

Keel shook his head, face partially covered by a palm. "I'm sorry, my friend," he whispered. "I've slipped this time… I should've held myself instead of doing such an outburst."  
基尔摇了摇头，半张脸被手掌遮住。“对不起，我的朋友，”他低声说，“这次我失态了……我本该克制自己，而不是如此爆发。”

"That is all right. We sometimes commit mistakes beyond our control."  
“没关系。我们有时会犯一些无法控制的错误。”

"Yet with this case, we shouldn't err as humans," Keel said. "But you're right; I forgot that we are one step further than they do."  
“然而在这种情况下，我们不该犯人性上的错误，”基尔说，“但你是对的；我忘了我们比他们更进一步。”

"Do you have a decision this time?"  
"这次你拿定主意了吗？"

Keel turned to face Evgenyi.  
基尔转向面对叶夫根尼。

"Yes," the old man said. "As scheduled, we shall bring down the hammer: smite them all on the anvil."  
"是的，"老人说。"按照计划，我们将挥下铁锤：在砧板上将他们全部击碎。"

---

Back in Japan, everyone in the room felt uneasy, with the complete lack of elation and relief, and grimly knowing that the die has been finally cast, that SEELE will be coming tomorrow with Armageddon onto their doorstep.  
回到日本，房间里的每个人都感到不安，完全没有喜悦和解脱，只是沉重地知道命运的骰子已经掷出，SEELE 明天就会带着末日降临到他们门前。

"So he has confirmed what he thought is your divine lineage," Fuyutsuki said to Shinji, who was standing besides him.  
“所以他确认了他认为的你神圣的血统，”冬月对站在他身边的真嗣说。

The young man nodded. "Do you think they're all true? Is he telling the truth?"  
年轻人点点头。“你认为这些都是真的吗？他在说实话吗？”

Fuyutsuki sighed. "Along with the facts he presented to us, Lorenz has given the other piece of the puzzle," he said. "Whatever he said answered my lingering suspicions about your mother for years, as to why she is held in very high regard."  
冬月叹了口气。“除了他向我们展示的事实，伦洛兹还提供了另一块拼图，”他说。“无论他说了什么，都解答了我多年来对你母亲为何备受尊崇的疑虑。”

"Just like Mary Magdalene," Shinji said. "I didn't know she was that important."  
“就像抹大拉的玛利亚一样，”真嗣说。“我不知道她有那么重要。”

"Yes," Fuyutsuki answered. "As much as the truth has dispelled our long-standing misconceptions shaped by time, myth and history, what we have to be concerned the most now is how far we could hold them back before they could take control of Unit One."  
“是的，”冬月回答。“尽管真相已经消除了我们长期以来由时间、神话和历史塑造的误解，但我们现在最需要关注的是，在他们控制初号机之前，我们能阻止他们到什么程度。”

On one hand, Shinji thought, Unit-01 was powerful than any of her sisters within the NERV inventory, thanks largely to the ingested S2 Engine, and could hold onto her own in combat.  
一方面，真嗣心想，得益于吞噬的 S2 引擎，零号机在 NERV 的库存中比她的任何姐妹都要强大，能够在战斗中独当一面。

But at the same time her very immense power source makes Unit-01 a very attractive target that SEELE will want to capture at all costs, which meant there had to be a way to slow down the Mass-Production Evas, if not stop them, without having to depend too much on both Evas alone.  
但与此同时，她强大的能量源也使得零号机成为 SEELE 不惜一切代价想要捕获的目标，这意味着必须找到一种方法，即使不能完全阻止量产型 EVA，也要设法减缓它们的行动，而不必过度依赖 EVA 本身。

"Sir… what are we going to do next?" Shinji finally asked.  
“先生…我们接下来该怎么办？”真嗣终于问道。

"Prepare, plan and practice, and then tomorrow we'll have to take the whole brunt of their war machine as they come," Fuyutsuki replied. "For them, I fear that there will be no prisoners this time."  
“准备、计划并练习，明天我们就得承受他们整个战争机器的冲击，”冬月回答道。“对他们来说，恐怕这次不会有俘虏了。”

**Author's Notes:** This chapter completes the nebulous mysteries surrounding Yui Ikari Saint-Clair, answering the questions about her unique and powerful standing within the LW alternate universe (and hence departing from established Eva canon, which, despite depicting Yui as a very important woman, never gave an explanation about her little-known origins).  
作者笔记：本章节解答了围绕 Yui Ikari Saint-Clair 的模糊谜团，阐明了她在 LW 平行宇宙中独特而强大的地位（因此脱离了既定的 EVA 正史，尽管正史中描绘 Yui 是一个非常重要的女性，但从未解释过她鲜为人来的身世）。

While doing my research for this fic, I stumbled upon the intriguing idea of indelibly linking Yui with Mary Magdalene by purported divine lineage and importance, having been inspired by my readings of thought-provoking books such as _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ and _The Templar Revelation_ (both of which became the basis for the best-selling novel _The Da Vinci Code -_ but no offense, _Digital Fortress_, however erroneous it may be, is my _only_ dog-eared favorite among Brown's works).  
在为这篇同人进行研究时，我偶然发现了一个引人入胜的想法，即将 Yui 与抹大拉的玛利亚通过所谓的神圣血统和重要性不可磨灭地联系起来，这受到了我阅读的启发性书籍如《圣血，圣杯》和《圣殿骑士启示录》的影响（这两本书是《达芬奇密码》畅销小说的基础——但无意冒犯，尽管《数字城堡》可能存在错误，它却是我在布朗作品中唯一翻阅得破旧的最爱）。

I tried my best to summarize the Herculean amount of information provided by those books into a few paragraphs, but I hope they suffice, yet should this chapter leaves you doubting with more questions or you feel I err in some parts (writing a fic invites a few author-inspired liberties to make a few plot twists), I suggest that _HBHG_ and _Revelation_ be read for further clarification, for the _Da Vinci Code_ can be erroneous at times.  
我尽力将那些书中海量的信息浓缩成几个段落，但愿它们足够详尽。若此章节令你心生疑窦，或觉我在某些部分有所疏漏（撰写同人难免会有些作者自创的自由以制造情节转折），我建议阅读《圣血与圣杯》及《启示录》以进一步澄清，因为《达芬奇密码》有时也难免出错。

Going back to the story at hand (and this being an extension of the final meeting between SEELE and Gendo), and as I have envisioned, this is the first time Keel and Shinji confront each other (almost) in person, and that the former tries to tempt the young man to give up resistance and embrace the purported rewards of Instrumentality, which Shinji then refuses because of the terrifying apocalyptic possibilities it could bring upon the world's inhabitants.  
回到我们手头的故事（这也是 SEELE 与碇最后一次会面的延续），正如我所设想，这是基尔和真嗣首次（几乎）面对面相遇，前者试图诱使年轻人放弃抵抗，接受人类补完计划所宣称的回报，但真嗣拒绝了，因为他预见到这可能给世界居民带来恐怖的末日后果。

Until next time. _J'ai ose._  
下次见。我敢为之。

His eyes flew wide open at first, but everything looked like a blur; completely disoriented, he had no sense of time or space, but he tried to squint and focus slowly until the first conscious thought came to him: _where are my glasses?_  
他的眼睛起初猛地睁大，但一切看起来都模糊不清；完全迷失方向，他失去了对时间和空间的感知，但他努力眯起眼睛，慢慢聚焦，直到第一个清醒的念头浮现：我的眼镜在哪儿？

Instinctively his hands darted out, scrabbled over the bedside tables, trying to find them, but no, there weren't any bedside tables, or for that matter, he wasn't in his bedroom. His nose sniffed the air; it smelled dank and cold.  
本能地，他的双手迅速伸出，在床头柜上摸索着，试图找到它们，但没有，那里没有任何床头柜，或者说，他根本不在自己的卧室里。他的鼻子嗅了嗅空气；那气味潮湿而冰冷。

No, his bed was made out of hard foam encased in cotton fabric, and that he can now see the concrete-gray ceiling.  
不，他的床是由硬泡沫包裹在棉布里制成的，而且现在他能看见那混凝土灰色的天花板。

The shock of reality now came to him with the sudden intensity of a bomb dropped over his head.  
现实的冲击此刻以一种突如其来的强烈感降临到他头上，如同炸弹在他头顶爆炸一般。

He was in jail.

More precisely, inside the jail cell of Number One Stockade of NERV Security Forces Group, behind carbon-steel bars and reinforced concrete a foot thick on three sides.  
更确切地说，是在 NERV 保安部队第一拘留所的牢房内，四周被一英尺厚的碳钢栏杆和加固混凝土墙包围着。

Worse, he felt that his left hand was tightly wrapped in something, so he lifted it up to find bandage covering up much of his palm, where Adam was once used to reside.  
更糟糕的是，他感觉到自己的左手被紧紧包裹着，于是他抬起手来，发现手掌大部分被绷带覆盖，那里曾是亚当的栖身之所。

Now all of his memories suddenly came back rushing with a vengeance, including the last scene he witnessed before blacking out.  
现在，他所有的记忆突然如潮水般汹涌而至，包括他在昏迷前看到的最后一幕。

Indeed, Fuyutsuki had Adam surgically removed from his hand, and it hit Gendo Ikari right in the gut that it made him stand up on the cot and look around his surroundings before focusing on his garments, which was nothing but a prisoner's cotton jumpsuit.  
确实，冬月已经让医生从他手上切除了亚当，这让碇源堂感到一阵剧痛，他猛地从床铺上站起来，环顾四周，然后才将注意力转向自己的衣物——那不过是一件囚犯穿的棉质连体衣。

He was no longer the Commander but a powerless inmate stuck in the very same cell where less than 12 hours ago, here he consigned Fuyutsuki and many others for trying to conspire against him.  
他不再是指挥官，而是一个无力的囚犯，被困在不到 12 小时前他曾将冬月和其他密谋反对他的人关押的同一间牢房里。

It made him furious, sick to the stomach that he had no choice except to vent his ire by repeatedly pounding his other functional hand, formed into a fist, on the mattress while muttering profanities in a display of rage he had never expressed in years.  
这让他怒不可遏，恶心至极，除了用另一只还能动的手握成拳头，反复捶打床垫，同时低声咒骂，以发泄多年来未曾表露的愤怒外，别无选择。

Whatever hopes and dreams he had were finally dashed in this dark jail cell, even as the lone video camera installed on the ceiling monitored his angry fit.  
无论他曾怀有何种希望与梦想，都在这间昏暗的牢房中彻底破灭，即便天花板上孤零零的摄像头记录着他愤怒的发作。

As they walked out of the communications room, after Fuyutsuki said that they'll have lunch, Shinji didn't know what else to say except an avalanche of questions came crashing upon him, as to how and why his mother came to assume prime importance in his father's life, and then he wondered, _Did he intended to marry her? For what good?_  
当他们走出通讯室，听完冬月说要去吃午饭后，真嗣除了涌上心头的一连串问题外，不知还能说些什么，比如他的母亲是如何以及为何在他的父亲生活中变得如此重要，接着他又想，父亲是打算和她结婚吗？这有什么好处呢？

He watched Fuyutsuki briefly converse with General Yamamoto and some others before they bid goodbye to work on their preparations for the eventual battle, before they walked on to the direction of the elevator doors.  
他看着冬月与山本将军和其他人简短交谈，然后他们告别去准备即将到来的战斗，之后他们继续向电梯门走去。

_I don't understand except… Was he really that mad? Was all of this worth the ambition?  
我不明白，除了……他真的那么疯狂吗？这一切值得那份野心吗？_

Shinji sighed, but then his hand found itself clasping with Asuka's.  
真嗣叹了口气，但随后他的手便与明日香的手紧紧相握。

"I don't know what else to say," the girl said. "Either that old man's bullshitting or he's telling us the truth."  
“我不知道还能说什么，”女孩说道，“要么那老头在胡扯，要么他就是在告诉我们真相。”

"Mother," Shinji said.

"All of what he said had occurred before, from what I heard about, with that old fart linking you with… Jesus. I mean, it's still far-fetched, there's no solid proof that He ever managed to survive after being crucified."  
“据我所知，他说的那些事以前都发生过，那个老混蛋把你和……耶稣扯上关系。我是说，这仍然很牵强，没有确凿证据证明他在被钉十字架后还活了下来。”

Shinji shook his head, the burden of information weighed against his mind. "I'll never know. It's too overwhelming."  
真嗣摇了摇头，信息的重担压在他的心头。“我永远不会知道。这太令人难以承受了。”

---

Just a couple of meters abreast, Fuyutsuki and Misato were discussing about Lorenz's allegations. Though the hologram images looked authentic, both of them doubted the veracity of the old man's facts.  
就在几米开外，冬月和美里正在讨论洛伦兹的指控。尽管全息影像看起来很真实，但他们俩都对这位老人的事实真实性表示怀疑。

"Do you think all of that is possible?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
“你认为这一切都有可能吗？”冬月问道。

"It's too unlikely," Misato said. "I mean, sir, anyone can make up a story on paper or parchment, even if it's a couple of millennia old."  
"这太不可能了，" 美里说。"我是说，长官，任何人都可以在纸上或羊皮纸上编造故事，即使它有几千年的历史。"

"I believe that, thousands of years ago, the human mind, conditioned to superstition and the supernatural, will believe in anything presented as fact. Religious relics are one of several examples; these are highly venerated by the common folk as miraculous and coming from holy men, even if there's no definitive proof of their authenticity, and more likely manufactured by those in the know."  
"我相信，几千年前，人类的心灵受迷信和超自然现象的影响，会相信任何被呈现为事实的东西。宗教遗物就是几个例子之一；这些遗物被普通民众高度尊崇为奇迹，并来自圣人，即使没有确凿的证据证明其真实性，更可能是由知情者制造的。"

"Isn't there's some books that debate over the divinity of Christ?" Ritsuko said as she walked up.  
"不是有些书在争论基督的神性吗？" 律子边走边说。"

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Of course, with some trying to prove or disprove, but it all comes down to a matter of faith."  
冬月点了点头。“当然，有人试图证明或反驳，但归根结底，这关乎信仰。”

"Ikari himself may have to explain as to how and why he came up with this in the first place," Misato said. "There has to be a motive, a reason for madness."  
“碇自己可能也得解释一下，他最初是怎么想到这个的，以及为什么，”美里说，“总得有个动机，疯狂背后必有原因。”

Just then Hamamoto came up to Fuyutsuki's side, with a phone in hand, said, "My boys got Ikari's room secured and the safe cracked open. I've ordered them to bring out anything that can be used as evidence."  
就在这时，滨本走到冬月身边，手里拿着电话，说道：“我的人已经确保了碇的房间安全，保险箱也被打开了。我命令他们把任何可以用作证据的东西都带出来。”

Fuyutsuki and everyone else paused in mid-stride. "What?" he asked.  
冬月和其他人都停下了脚步。“什么？”他问道。

"They've got tons of documents," Hamamoto said. "The whole nine yards, everything from his journals, to memos… well, enough to implicate."  
“他们有大量的文件，”滨本说，“应有尽有，从他的日记到备忘录……足以定罪。”

Again, Hamamoto's phone rang, cutting him off, prompting the director to converse with a subordinate on the line, before he returned to Fuyutsuki.  
又一次，滨本的手机响起，打断了他，导演与电话那头的下属交谈后，又回到了冬月身边。

"Well?" he asked. "What else?"  
"嗯？" 他问道。"还有什么？"

"Ikari is awake now," Hamamoto said. "Unfortunately they had to restrain him down because he was throwing a serious fit in the cell. Anyway, if you wish to talk to Ikari, I'll give orders for them to bring him to the interrogation room."  
"碇已经醒了，" 羽本说。"不幸的是，他们不得不把他束缚住，因为他在牢房里闹得很厉害。无论如何，如果你想和碇谈话，我会下令让他们把他带到审讯室。"

Grimacing, Fuyutsuki turned to Misato and Ritsuko, but Shinji and the other Children looked surprised.  
皱着眉头，冬月转向美里和律子，但真嗣和其他孩子们看起来很惊讶。

"Father's awake?" the boy asked.  
"父亲醒了吗？"男孩问道。

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Yes."

"Can I speak to him?"  
"我能和他说话吗？"

The former professor thought of this for a moment, before he made a decision.  
这位前教授思考了一会儿，然后做出了决定。

"I think you have the right to listen as much as I do," he said, "because whatever he says could put your doubts to rest once and for all, and could also decide our fate, so come with us."  
"我认为你有权听取，就像我一样，"他说，"因为无论他说什么，都可能彻底消除你的疑虑，同时也能决定我们的命运，所以跟我们来吧。"

"Thank you, sir," Shinji said, nodding and then turned to Asuka. "I have to go."  
"谢谢您，先生，"真嗣点头说道，然后转向明日香。"我必须去。"

"It's okay," Asuka said, watching him walk over to Fuyutsuki and Hamamoto.  
"没关系，"明日香说，看着他走向冬月和滨本。"

"Are you ready for this?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
"你准备好了吗？" 冬月问道。

"Yes," Shinji answered. "I regret nothing."  
"是的，" 真嗣回答。"我毫不后悔。"

Fuyutsuki then focused his attention to the two women. "The rest of you," he said. "Go ahead and have lunch without us, then head to the testing room. We'll catch up later."  
冬月随后将注意力转向两位女性。"你们其他人，" 他说。"先去吃午饭，然后直接去测试室。我们稍后会跟上。"

Misato saluted. "Yes, sir."  
美里敬了个礼。“是，长官。”

"And Akagi," Fuyutsuki added. "Put Nagisa through the wringer. You and your people know what to do."  
“还有赤木，”冬月补充道。“让渚经历一番考验。你和你的团队知道该怎么做。”

Ritsuko nodded. "It'll be done, Professor."  
律子点头。“会完成的，教授。”

Outside, while the rest of his tank squadron were busy setting up their firing positions, Sergeant Taro Miyazawa went about checking his Type-10's electronic fire control system, just a couple of feet away from the 120mm L44 smoothbore cannon.  
外面，当他的坦克中队的其他成员忙于布置射击位置时，宫泽太郎军士正在检查他的 10 式坦克的电子火控系统，距离那门 120 毫米 L44 滑膛炮仅几英尺远。

He eyed the total loadout on the multifunction LED panel, which gave him a tally of thirty kinetic-energy HEAT rounds sitting in the loading bin; these were the same type of munitions used in the American M1A1 Abrams, but manufactured locally under license as part of the Mutual Defense Treaty.  
他盯着多功能 LED 面板上的总载荷，显示装载箱中有三十发动能破甲弹；这些弹药与美国 M1A1 艾布拉姆斯坦克使用的类型相同，但作为互惠防御条约的一部分，在当地获得许可生产。

The 48-ton Type-10 main battle tank was built as a stronger successor to the Type-90, with greater emphasis on selectable firepower, armored protection, speed (up to 70 kilometers per hour), automation and connectivity, all the while having to meet strict standards as not to ruin pavement.  
48 吨的 10 式主战坦克作为 90 式的更强继任者而建造，更加注重可选择的火力、装甲保护、速度（最高可达每小时 70 公里）、自动化和连接性，同时必须满足严格的标准，以免破坏路面。

The autoloader system also allowed for a smaller crew, and provides them greater freedom to concentrate on the fighting than worry about mechanical reliability and timing.  
自动装弹系统还使得所需乘员减少，让他们能更专注于战斗，而非机械可靠性和时间安排的担忧。

Miyazawa sighed in satisfaction, knowing that his tank was well-prepared for the task, but for the first time his unit would soon be engaged in battle.  
宫泽满意地叹了口气，知道他的坦克已为任务做好充分准备，但他的部队即将首次投入战斗，这让他心中首次泛起波澜。

Then he thought of the last thing he needed to do before lunch, so with his fingers Miyazawa reached in the insides of his left breast pocket, fished out a laminated picture of singer-actress Atsuko Maeda, which he kept for years after she graduated from AKB48, and using a roll of duct tape, he stuck the picture next to the MFD panel.  
随后，他想起了午饭前需要做的最后一件事，于是宫泽用手指伸进左胸口袋，掏出了一张压膜的歌手兼演员前田敦子的照片，这是她在 AKB48 毕业后他珍藏多年的，然后用一卷胶带，他将照片贴在了多功能显示器（MFD）面板旁。

To her portrait he then whispered reverently, "Acchan… Watch over me, just as we'll have to fight soon on your behalf."  
他对着她的肖像虔诚地低语，“麻里…请守护我，正如我们即将为你而战。”

The interrogation room was bare, finished in non-gloss white and with one side of the wall faced with one-way glass – the observation mirror – save for a folding table and four seats; on the table, the obligatory pitcher of water and two stainless-steel tumblers, a pad and a pencil, and a telephone.  
审讯室空荡荡的，墙壁涂成无光泽的白色，一侧装有单向玻璃——观察镜——除了一个折叠桌和四把椅子外别无他物；桌上放着必备的一壶水和两个不锈钢杯，一个记事本和一支铅笔，还有一部电话。

Sitting on a folding chair and facing Fuyutsuki, and with Hamamoto and Shinji watching behind the mirror inside the observation room, Gendo Ikari looked very much the defrocked prophet who once envisioned the inevitability of Instrumentality, now dressed in a jumpsuit, with his ankles cuffed with manacles, wearing a morose face with slatted eyes that stared at the white vinyl tiles beneath his slipper-sheathed feet.  
坐在折叠椅上面对着冬月，身后是透过观察室镜子注视的滨本和真嗣，碇源堂看起来就像一个被剥夺了预言家身份的人，他曾预见到人类补完计划的必然性，如今穿着连体衣，脚踝上戴着镣铐，面带忧郁，双眼斜视着脚下白色乙烯瓷砖，脚上套着拖鞋。

Behind Gendo was a pair of BDU-garbed guards standing, parade-rest position; they were present to restrain him with strong-arm should Gendo decides to behave the wrong way.  
在碇源堂身后，两名身着 BDU 制服的警卫以立正姿势站立；他们随时准备在碇源堂行为不当时用强硬手段制服他。

However, in this situation Gendo looked bitterly defeated and thus accepted his fate.  
然而，在这种情境下，碇源堂显得苦涩而屈服，因此接受了他的命运。

"What do you want from me?" he asked.  
“你想从我这里得到什么？”他问道。

"No, but how are you feeling?" Fuyutsuki questioned instead, with a tone that implied an attempt to understand than provoke hostility.  
"不，但你感觉如何？" 冬月反问道，语气中透露出试图理解而非挑起敌意。

Gendo looked down at his left bandaged palm. "What have you done?" he asked.  
碇源堂低头看着他包扎着的左手掌。"你做了什么？" 他问道。

"It is my prerogative, I'm afraid to say, that I must protect you from yourself."  
"恐怕我必须说，保护你免受自身伤害是我的特权。"

Ikari sighed again. "This is my dream… and you took it away," he said.  
碇叹了口气。“这是我的梦想……而你夺走了它，”他说。

"You may call Instrumentality a dream for you to achieve," Fuyutsuki said, "but what of this world? Do you even _care_ if it could possibly jeopardize the balance of life and of this universe?"  
“你可以将人类补完计划称为你的梦想，”冬月说，“但这个世界呢？你是否在乎它可能危及生命和这个宇宙的平衡？”

Instead of a characteristic outburst, Gendo said nothing, so Fuyutsuki decided to tone down his voice.  
没有惯常的爆发，碇一言不发，于是冬月决定缓和语气。

"I'm sorry," he said. "This is the only way for me to save you from your madness, to bring you back to reality."  
"对不起，"他说。"这是我唯一能救你脱离疯狂，带你回到现实的方法。"

"What else?" Gendo asked, apparently wishing to change the subject.  
"还有什么？"源度问，显然是想换个话题。"

"Let's be frank for the first time," Fuyutsuki said. "It's just you and me now."  
"让我们第一次坦诚相待，"冬月说。"现在只剩下你和我了。"

Gendo nodded. 源度点了点头。

In a seemingly sympathetic tone, Fuyutsuki said, "I haven't asked you about this for a very long time, but what made you decide to pursue Metabiology?"  
仿佛带着同情般的语气，冬月说道，“我已经很久没有问过你这个问题了，是什么让你决定研究超生物学的？”

The elder Ikari took a breath, and answered, "In the beginning, I had no interest in anything else, except trying to escape the mediocrity of family life."  
老碇轻吸一口气，回答道，“起初，除了试图逃离平庸的家庭生活，我对其他任何事情都没有兴趣。”

And so he began to tell his untold story.  
于是，他开始讲述那段未曾诉说的故事。

---

Back in the early 1980s, in the days when Japan rode on its economic success, with the bubble burst unforeseen and still far away, Gendo was the only son between a father who worked late and sometimes came home drunk, and a mother who kept on being faithful despite some nights when they bickered and she had to suffer the blows.  
回到 20 世纪 80 年代初，那时日本正享受着经济繁荣，泡沫破裂的阴影尚未显现，遥不可及。源渡是家中独子，父亲工作至深夜，有时醉醺醺地回家；母亲则始终忠诚，尽管有些夜晚他们争吵不休，她不得不承受那些打击。

Yes, he could still remember the miasma of his father's alcoholic breath, the old man degenerating into a spiral of alcoholism, finding empty bottles in drawers, wastebaskets, the kitchen sink and even in the miniscule bathtub.  
是的，他仍能清晰记得父亲那股酒精味的气息，老人逐渐沉沦于酗酒的漩涡，家中抽屉、废纸篓、厨房水槽甚至狭小的浴缸里，随处可见空酒瓶。

The old man was obsessed at trying to work hard, even to the point of dressing up with painstaking detail, but intentionally forgetting that he had a family to give more time. As Gendo grew up, he realized that his father married his mother out of convenience, that is, just to make her pay attention to his needs as he went to and came back from work: serve him beer, wash and iron his clothes, fix his bed, and even give him a blowjob without intercourse.  
那位老人沉迷于努力工作，甚至到了一丝不苟地打扮自己的地步，却故意忘记了还有家庭需要他投入更多时间。随着源堂长大，他意识到父亲娶母亲只是出于便利，也就是说，只是为了让母亲在他上下班时关注他的需求：给他倒啤酒，洗熨衣服，整理床铺，甚至在没有性行为的情况下为他口交。

Yes, she did all of that, and then the occasional flare-up of domestic violence, their shouting filling up the house (and never a home) that Gendo, sickened by the chaos of flying pans and shattering dishes, obliged himself to escape through the door without them paying attention, and wander in the streets until everything was settled by the time he came back at two in the morning.  
是的，她做了所有这些，然后偶尔还会爆发家庭暴力，他们的争吵声充斥着房子（从未成为一个家），源堂因飞舞的平底锅和破碎的盘子而感到恶心，便趁他们不注意时逃出门外，在街上游荡，直到凌晨两点回来时一切已平息。

Alone on the streets, Gendo would find himself picking fights with other rival gangs, closed-fist white-knuckle battles, with him earning cuts and bruises, but sometimes he would lose in skirmishes and would be left lying unconscious on the concrete, but only Gendo had the animal brutality that instilled fear and respect among those who came across his path.  
独自一人在街头，源度会与其他敌对帮派挑起争斗，紧握拳头、拼尽全力的战斗，他身上留下了刀伤和瘀伤，但有时他也会在冲突中败下阵来，躺在水泥地上不省人事，唯有源度那种野兽般的残忍，让那些与他相遇的人既畏惧又尊敬。

But violence and being feared weren't the only things that consisted of Gendo's personality, for instead of resorting to truancy, and to wean himself away from dysfunctional family life, he paid more time studying without needing anyone's help; at the local library he found himself buried in books until closing time, or hanging around at the bookstore, browsing every tome for anything that might be of interest for him.  
然而，暴力和恐惧并非源度性格的全部，他没有选择逃学，也没有沉溺于家庭的失能生活，而是花更多时间自学，无需任何人的帮助；在当地图书馆，他埋头于书海直至闭馆，或在书店徘徊，翻阅每一本书籍，寻找任何可能引起他兴趣的内容。

Until Gendo came across a bunch of books concerning about ancient secrets and supposed secret societies, cabals who possessed absolute power to manipulate and shape the destinies of nations; the books painted pictures of secretive men presiding over councils, discussing and deciding the fate of any individual, group, society, even whole governments and militaries, twisting all of them according to their needs like sheep being herded to anywhere they wished.  
直到源度偶然发现了一批关于古代秘密和所谓秘密社团的书籍，这些社团据称拥有绝对权力来操纵和塑造国家的命运；书中描绘了神秘人物主持议会的场景，讨论并决定个人、团体、社会乃至整个政府和军队的命运，根据他们的需要像驱赶羊群一样任意摆布。

Tantalized with the possibility of wielding unthinkable power, the books gave him an idea: _Why I can't be somebody? Why I can't forge my own destiny?_  
这些书籍激发了他掌握难以想象力量的可能性，给了他一个想法：为什么我不能成为某个人物？为什么我不能塑造自己的命运？

---

"That was what I told myself," Gendo said, his hand placed over a tattered paperback Japanese copy of _Holy Blood, Holy Grail._ "That was when I began to search something that I can use, in order to show the world what I could do to utterly change it, the idea of power in my hands."  
"那就是我告诉自己的，" 源渡说，他的手放在一本破旧的日文版《圣血，圣杯》平装书上。"那是我开始寻找能够利用的东西的时候，为了向世界展示我能如何彻底改变它，将力量掌握在我手中的想法。"

A guard had already carted in one of several boxes consisting of Gendo's personal papers and books, all of which became the basis of his personal drive to seize Instrumentality. On the table there was now a pot of steaming green tea, two small cups, and a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and an ashtray.  
一名警卫已经搬进了一个装有源渡个人文件和书籍的箱子，这些都成为他夺取人类补完计划个人动力的基础。桌上现在有一壶冒着热气的绿茶，两个小杯，还有一包香烟、一个打火机和一个烟灰缸。

"Even if possessing that power means you tampering with the fabric of time and space?" Fuyutsuki asked, his hand cradling a cup full of tea.  
"即使拥有那种力量意味着你干涉了时空的结构？" 冬月问，他的手托着一杯满满的茶。

Gendo nodded before he leaned forward.  
源渡点了点头，然后身体前倾。

"When the history of man comes to an end," he said. "I'm supposed to act as a savior from God… Yet, I don't need His salvation but I seek vengeance upon that deity, nor I wish to be reborn as His child."  
"当人类的历史走到尽头时，"他说道，"我本应作为神的救世主行事……然而，我不需要他的救赎，我寻求的是对那位神祇的复仇，我也不愿作为他的孩子重生。"

"You wanted to be a demigod?"  
"你想成为半神吗？"

"No," Gendo disagreed. "I want to _become_ God; I want myself to _replace_ God so that I will never lose anything again."  
"不，" 碇源堂反驳道，"我想成为神；我要取代神，这样我就再也不会失去任何东西了。"

Fuyutsuki looked unconcerned. "It makes sense that you decided to become a geneticist."  
冬月看起来并不在意。"你决定成为遗传学家，这很合理。"

"Exactly, for through the manipulation of genes there is greater power inherent in such an act than launching nuclear weapons; ultimate power is thus found in creation than destruction."  
"正是如此，因为通过基因操纵所蕴含的力量，比发射核武器更为强大；最终的力量在于创造而非毁灭。"

"You mean the power over life and death, and the possibility of conquering death?"  
"你是说掌控生死的力量，以及征服死亡的可能性？"

"That was what I sought for, the mythical Tree of Life, but then Lorenz had the means to make that possible."  
"那正是我所追求的，传说中的生命之树，但后来洛伦兹拥有了实现这一可能的手段。"

Fuyutsuki took a sip of his tea, and then asked, "Is that why you decided to find Yui?"  
冬月啜了一口茶，然后问道：“这就是你决定寻找唯的原因吗？”

"Yes," he said. "Her father had access to Lorenz."  
"是的，"他说。"她的父亲能够接触到洛伦兹。"

"How did you know much about her?"  
"你怎么对她了解这么多？"

"The _Dossiers Secrets_ provided me the answer, and from there I found a way to insinuate myself into the power structure."  
"《秘密档案》给了我答案，从那里我找到了一条渗透进权力结构的路径。"

---

The _Dossiers Secrets_, or more precisely _Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau_ or _Secret Files of Henri Lobineau_, was a 27-page document compiled by Philippe Toscan du Plantier and deposited in the Bibliotheque nationale de France in the 1960s. Despite questionable authenticity, the document attempted to prove that the Plantards and the Saint-Clairs were the legitimate royal blood of France, and thus included genealogy diagrams to link the family back to Dagobert II, the Merovinginan king of France.*  
《秘密档案》，或更准确地说《亨利·洛比诺的秘密档案》，是由菲利普·托斯卡·杜·普兰蒂耶编纂的一份 27 页文件，于 20 世纪 60 年代存放在法国国家图书馆。尽管其真实性存疑，该文件试图证明普兰塔家族和圣克莱尔家族是法国王室的正统血脉，因此包含了将家族追溯至法国墨洛温王朝国王达戈贝尔二世的族谱图。*

While researching on the Internet, Gendo discovered scanned copies of the _Dossiers_, and then perused the translations to know where to find. To his surprise, he found that the eldest scion of the prominent Saint-Clair family had married a Japanese national, and produced a daughter named Yui. Gendo went about tracing the whereabouts of this young woman, and conveniently she was studying in Kyoto University.  
在互联网上研究时，源渡发现了秘密档案的扫描副本，随后查阅了翻译以了解如何寻找。令他惊讶的是，他发现显赫的圣克莱尔家族的长子娶了一位日本国民，并育有一女名为唯。源渡着手追踪这位年轻女子的下落，巧合的是，她正在京都大学就读。

Naturally, Gendo decided to wait for an opportunity, and then one day he found Yui struggling with the vending machine, trying to get her drink out. He offered help, took out the can and gave it to her, before introducing himself.  
自然，源渡决定等待机会，终于有一天他发现唯在努力从自动售货机中取出饮料。他上前帮忙，取出罐子递给她，随后自我介绍。

Despite his questionable, dangerous reputation, Gendo was personally astounded that a sophisticated, blue-blooded woman like Yui would fall for him, but even then he had to go through her gauntlet by coming clean, forswearing street brawling and drinking and turning his energies to further study, himself a ferocious beast tamed by a beautiful nymph.  
尽管根渡有着可疑且危险的名声，但他个人还是对像唯这样出身名门、高雅的女性会倾心于他感到震惊。但即便如此，他还是得通过她的考验，坦白一切，戒除街头斗殴和酗酒，将精力转向进一步的学习。他，这个被美丽仙女驯服的凶猛野兽。

Later, upon his graduation he found himself approached by one of Keel's representatives, offered him a lucrative job on the spot, and accepted it. Again, he was impressed by Yui's capacity to pull strings for his benefit.  
后来，在他毕业时，他发现自己被基尔的一位代表接近，当场提供了一份高薪工作，他接受了。再次，他对唯为他牵线搭桥的能力印象深刻。

From there, and as a geneticist, Gendo had to make a good impression on Keel, doing his best to integrate himself into the SEELE power structure on a step-by-step basis, until he came far into the nomenclature that sooon he came face to face with the enigmatic man who had the world in his pocket.  
从那时起，作为一名遗传学家，根渡必须在基尔面前留下好印象，尽其所能逐步融入 SEELE 的权力结构，直到他深入到那个不久后便与那位掌控世界的神秘人物面对面接触的层级。

Inside the observation room, Shinji and Hamamoto were eating ramen as they watched and listened to the conversation at the other side of the one-way mirror.  
在观察室内，真嗣和滨本正一边吃着拉面，一边通过单向镜观看和聆听另一边的对话。

"Definitely your father had planned all of this from the beginning," Hamamoto said as he put down his bowl on the table.  
“你父亲肯定从一开始就计划好了一切，”滨本说着将碗放在桌上。

Shinji nodded as he slurped the noodles, but then noticed the video camera mounted on a tripod. "Sir, is that camera running?"  
真嗣一边吸着面条一边点头，随后注意到了架在三脚架上的摄像机。“长官，那台摄像机在运行吗？”

"Yes," Hamamoto said. "Everything he says will be used as evidence."  
"是的，" 滨本说。"他说的每一句话都将作为证据。"

"I never thought he began all of this from an idea," Shinji said. "Heck, I haven't even met my grandparents."  
"我从没想过这一切始于一个想法，" 真嗣说。"见鬼，我甚至还没见过我的祖父母。"

Hamamoto sighed. "I personally checked your father's background, and from what I remember, regrettably both of his parents are now dead."  
滨本叹了口气。"我亲自查过你父亲的背景，据我所记得的，遗憾的是，他的父母都已经去世了。"

Shinji set down his now-empty bowl on the table. "I certainly wouldn't last long if I were in his place."  
真嗣将已经空了的碗放在桌上。“如果我处在他的位置，肯定撑不了多久。”

"I think you're lucky he wasn't your role model, and probably never will," Hamamoto said. "Living in a dysfunctional family can either make or break a man, to build character into a hero or create a monster. You see, in your father's case, he was trying to find an identity for himself, he wanted to run away, to turn a new leaf… except he was also driven by ambition, wanting to become what he couldn't be."  
“我觉得你很幸运，他不是你的榜样，可能永远也不会是，”滨本说。“在一个功能失调的家庭中生活，要么成就一个人，要么毁掉一个人，塑造英雄的品格或制造怪物。你看，在你父亲的情况下，他试图为自己找到一个身份，他想逃离，想重新开始……但他也被野心驱使，想要成为他无法成为的那种人。”

Shinji shrugged. "I simply wanted to live a normal life."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我只想过正常的生活。”

"Good," Hamamoto agreed. "Are you ambitious?"  
"很好，" 浜本同意道。"你有野心吗？"

"No, I'm not, sir."

"Then I hope you'll live a better life after this."  
"那么我希望你在这之后能过上更好的生活。"

"What about you?" Shinji asked.  
"那你呢？" 真嗣问道。"

"Me?" Hamamoto replied. "When this is over, I'm retiring for good, and I mean, my doctor said that I have to check on my stress levels."  
"我吗？" 滨本回答道，"这件事结束后，我就彻底退休了，我是说，我的医生告诉我必须关注我的压力水平。"

"You mean you're becoming tired?"  
"你是说你感到疲惫了？"

Hamamoto shook his head. "No, not like that, son," he said. "If I push myself too hard I could suffer myself a coronary or something, as I'm still trying to cut down my intake, like watching what I eat, drink or smoke."  
滨本摇了摇头。"不，不是那种疲惫，孩子，"他说，"如果我太勉强自己，可能会心脏病发作之类的，我还在努力减少摄入，比如注意饮食、饮酒和吸烟。"

"But, sir, you still look fine."  
"但是，先生，您看起来依然很好。"

The older man looked up at the glass. "Tomorrow… I don't know what's going to happen to me, or to my family, or to all of us. Even with our best planning and preparations, anything can happen. We could win the day or lose altogether."  
年长的男人抬头望向玻璃。“明天……我不知道会发生什么，无论是对我，还是对我的家人，或是对我们所有人。即便我们做了最好的计划和准备，任何事情都可能发生。我们可能会赢得这一天，也可能彻底失败。”

"Like being killed." “就像被杀一样。”

Hamamoto looked thoughtful. "This morning," he said. "I thought about my life and what fate I could be meeting soon. I've seen everything; I lived a life that I tried my best to make it worthwhile, all the while I fought my little wars, losing some, winning some, and yes, I've grown damn old enough that I don't think death should be feared."  
滨本看起来若有所思。“今天早上，”他说，“我思考了我的生活以及即将遭遇的命运。我见识过一切；我努力让我的生活变得有价值，同时我也在打着自己的小仗，有输有赢，是的，我已经老得足够认为死亡不应被恐惧。”

"I see," Shinji said.

"Son," Hamamoto said. "The great beauty of life is that only if you're not ambitious or afraid or greedy or vain or having any of those defects of the material world, you realize that simplicity makes mortal life more meaningful while we exist on this planet. You have friends not because you have riches or power or strength, but because you seek companionship, warmth and trust, and that you prove your friendship by returning them with an equal favor."  
“儿子，”滨本说，“生命的伟大之美在于，只有当你不野心勃勃、不害怕、不贪婪、不虚荣，或者没有这些物质世界的缺陷时，你才会意识到简单使我们在地球上存在的凡人生活更有意义。你有朋友不是因为你拥有财富、权力或力量，而是因为你寻求陪伴、温暖和信任，并且你通过以同等的好处回报他们来证明你的友谊。”

Shinji nodded.

"Another thing I'd like to ask."  
“还有一件事我想问。”

"Sure, why not, sir?"  
"当然可以，先生，为什么不呢？"

"You're steady with Asuka now?"  
"你现在和明日香关系稳定了？"

The young man chuckled. "Yes."  
年轻人轻笑道：“是的。”

Hamamoto grinned. "You two study hard till you finish getting your degrees, and then get hitched and create a family. You certainly don't want to be like your old man."  
滨本咧嘴一笑。“你们俩努力学习，直到拿到学位，然后结婚生子。当然，可别像你们的老爸那样。”

"Nope, I'm not going to be."  
“不会的，我不会那样。”

"In case I die before we win," Hamamoto said. "You have the power to begin a new age, and tell the world that they should never forget this accursed folly of madmen, as a burning reminder to rebuild humanity and create a paradise on earth without the sins and cruelty of the past… without want, malice, fear, or hunger."  
“万一我们在胜利前我先走了，”滨本说。“你有能力开启一个新时代，告诉世界永远不要忘记这些疯子的可憎愚蠢，以此炽热的警示来重建人类，在地球上创造一个没有过去罪恶与残酷的乐园……没有匮乏、恶意、恐惧或饥饿。”

"But everyone can't depend on me," Shinji said. "I'm just a boy."  
"但大家都不能依赖我，" 真嗣说。"我只是个孩子。"

"Yeah, son, and I know you're not a god, except only after this," Hamamoto said. "You and Asuka, and your friends, or for that matter, your generation and the next, will have to start from scratch, without shitty self-destruction. However, all of that will not be possible unless if you, the _Married Couple_, must first win tomorrow's damned battle."  
"是啊，孩子，我知道你不是神，除了这次，" 滨本说。"你和明日香，还有你的朋友们，或者说你们这一代和下一代，都得从头开始，不再自我毁灭。不过，这一切的前提是，你们这对夫妻必须先赢得明天的那场该死的战斗。"

---

"…and so in order to pursue your agenda, you decided to sell yourself out to Keel, right?" Fuyutsuki questioned.  
"…所以为了推进你的计划，你就决定把自己卖给基尔，对吧？" 冬月质问道。"

"I have to," Gendo answered. "He has the means, for after all he discovered the power that created life on this world. So I helped him unlock the mysteries to Adam, and whatever I found indelibly were linked to ancient texts that they kept for centuries, confirming those secrets as real than mythical."  
"我必须这么做，" 碇源堂回答，"他拥有手段，毕竟他发现了创造这个世界上生命的力量。所以我帮助他解开了亚当的秘密，而我所发现的一切都与他们保存了几个世纪的古老文献紧密相连，证实了这些秘密的真实性而非神话。"

"That explains why, in trying to bring back Yui, you decided to take Keel's plans and make them your own."  
"这就解释了为什么，在试图复活唯时，你决定采用基尔的计划并将其变为自己的。"

Gendo stared at Fuyutsuki right in the eye and said, "I say again, I never wanted to lose and I want her back. Instrumentality is the only way to make it possible."  
碇源堂直视着冬月，说道："我再说一遍，我从不想失去，我要她回来。人类补完计划是唯一能实现这一点的途径。"

Fuyutsuki shook his head. "Lorenz used us all for his ends, sold us out, and tomorrow he'll make his promise true."  
冬月摇了摇头。“洛伦兹利用了我们所有人来达到他的目的，出卖了我们，而明天他将兑现他的承诺。”

"He said that?"

"Yes, and he shall bring Instrumentality right on our doorstep, which is why we're preparing for the worst, and if possible, stop him."  
“是的，他将把人类补完计划直接带到我们家门口，这就是为什么我们正在为最坏的情况做准备，并尽可能阻止他。”

Gendo looked down and stared at his bandaged hand. "The initiative should have been mine…" He then looked up to Fuyutsuki and shouted, "WHERE'S ADAM?"  
碇源堂低头凝视着他包扎的手。“本该由我主导的……”随后他抬头望向冬月，大声喊道：“亚当在哪里？”

The elder Ikari slammed his right fist on the table, and the sudden outburst provoked the guards to step forward quickly, ready to grab Gendo. But their charge never rose from his seat, and seeing this, Fuyutsuki raised his hand, telling them to stand down.  
碇源堂老者猛地用右拳砸向桌子，突如其来的爆发让守卫们迅速上前，准备抓住源堂。但他们的目标并未从座位上起身，看到这一幕，冬月副司令举起手，示意他们退下。

It's OK, everything's under control.  
没事，一切都在掌控之中。

"That creature has now been kept safe from you," Fuyutsuki said coolly, surprisingly unfazed by Gendo's explosion of anger, watching the guards step back and resume their positions.  
“那生物现在已经安全远离你了，”冬月冷冷地说道，出奇地未被源堂的怒火所动摇，看着守卫们退回原位，恢复警戒。

Ikari was breathing heavily through his clenched teeth. "What?"  
碇真嗣紧咬牙关，呼吸沉重。“什么？”

"You have to restrain yourself. Whether it's you or Lorenz, either both of you could hasten the end of human existence as we know it."  
“你必须克制自己。无论是你还是洛伦兹，任何一方都可能加速我们所知人类存在的终结。”

"I don't care. I want Yui back."  
“我不在乎。我要找回唯。”

"But… Does bringing her back would make you or her happy, at the price of sacrificing humanity? Would it make your life more meaningful?"  
"但……以牺牲人类为代价让她回来，会让你或她幸福吗？这会让你的生活更有意义吗？"

Gendo said nothing, looking sullen without having anything to contradict.  
碇源堂一言不发，面色阴沉却无言反驳。

"If I were you, I would've accepted her fate a long time ago, and move on with life."  
"如果我是你，我早就接受她的命运了，然后继续生活。"

"I just can't. She's the only one that matters much for me, even if I have to fight against the world."  
"我就是做不到。她是我唯一在乎的人，即使我必须与全世界为敌。"

Again, Fuyutsuki shook his head, finding Gendo's stubbornness a hard, brick wall where any attempts at persuasion ended in futility of hurled water-filled balloons exploding on that wall.  
福音次再次摇头，发现碇源堂的固执就像一堵坚硬的砖墙，任何劝说的尝试都如同扔向墙上的水球，最终只会徒劳地爆炸开来。

This now meant changing to a different tack.  
这意味着现在需要改变策略。

"Yui isn't here anymore in this plane of existence, but Shinji is the only family you have right now," he said.  
"在这个存在层面，Yui 已经不在了，但真嗣是你现在唯一的家人，" 他说道。

Gendo looked away, as if to ignore the former professor, before he slowly buried his face upon open palms.  
源渡转过头去，仿佛要无视这位前教授，然后缓缓地将脸埋在张开的掌心中。

"When I'm with Shinji, I only hurt him," he said in a bitter tone, almost a whisper but trying to make his words heard just enough for Fuyutsuki to hear. "So, for me now… it's better that I do nothing."  
"和真嗣在一起时，我只会伤害他，" 他用苦涩的语气说道，几乎是耳语，但努力让自己的话足够让冬月听到。"所以，对我来说……现在最好是什么都不做。"

There was a moment of silence between the two men, before Fuyutsuki, for the first time in years since he left the waterfront slums at Gendo's behest, reached out for the pack of cigarettes and the lighter, shook out a stick and lit up. Trying to remember how to inhale, on the first puff he coughed loudly, prompting the guards to come to assist him, thinking that he could collapse from asphyxiation, but he waved them off as he got the routine right even as he was seeing stars.  
两人之间有片刻的沉默，随后，自多年前应源渡之邀离开海滨贫民窟以来，冬月首次伸出手去拿那包香烟和打火机，抖出一根点燃。试图回忆如何吸气，第一口便大声咳嗽起来，引得警卫们赶来帮忙，以为他会因窒息而倒下，但他挥手示意他们离开，即便眼前金星直冒，也总算掌握了要领。

"You want to smoke?" Fuyutsuki offered after a minute, pushing the pack and lighter across the table.  
“你想抽吗？”一分钟后，冬月提议道，将烟盒和打火机推过桌面。

Gendo didn't move for a second or two, and then begrudgingly he turned around, tapped the pack for a stick and put the tip to the butane flame.  
源渡没有立即动作，过了几秒，他才不情愿地转过身，轻敲烟盒取出一根，将烟头凑近丁烷火焰。

Soon the room was filled with wisps of smoke.  
很快，房间里便弥漫着缕缕烟雾。

"What changed your mind?" Fuyutsuki asked, as he carefully puffed.  
"是什么改变了你的想法？" 冬月问道，同时小心翼翼地吐着烟圈。

"I'm afraid of him," Gendo admitted, referring to Shinji.  
"我害怕他，" 碇源堂承认道，指的是真嗣。

"Why?"

"I'm not worthy of love because… I don't believe that I can be loved by others."  
"我不配得到爱，因为……我不相信自己能被别人爱。"

"Except you gave everything for Yui?"  
"除了你为唯付出了一切？"

The elder Ikari sighed. "Yes. She was what I cared for… she had everything that I didn't have, but no, not her wealth."  
碇源堂长叹一声。“是的。她是我所关心的人……她拥有我所没有的一切，但不是她的财富。”

"You craved for her affection?"  
"你渴望她的爱吗？"

Gendo nodded. 源堂点头。

"It's understandable now, as you've said your parents gave you nothing but misery."  
"现在可以理解了，正如你所说，你的父母除了给你痛苦之外什么也没给。"

"Yes."

"From what I heard, your son wanted your affection, attention… everything just to make him feel happy as if he's like any other kid in the world, with caring parents. But you decided not to, so all the time you shut away your heart."  
"据我所知，你的儿子渴望你的爱、关注……一切，只为让他感到快乐，就像世界上任何一个有爱父母的普通孩子一样。但你决定不给予，所以一直以来你都封闭了自己的心。"

Fuyutsuki pulled a drag, and added, "Instead we became his surrogate parents and siblings. We tried our best to provide him a substitute in your absence, but I understand he wanted you to be his only father."  
冬月吸了一口烟，补充道：“相反，我们成了他的代理父母和兄弟姐妹。我们尽力在你不在的时候为他提供替代品，但我知道他想要你成为他唯一的父亲。”

"It's too late," Gendo said tersely. "I'll die anyway."  
“太迟了，”碇源堂简短地说。“反正我也会死。”

"No, it's never. Not while you're still living."  
"不，永远不会。只要你还活着。"

"Impossible."

The old man decided that figuratively he'll have to transport both of them back to Kyoto, and so he took on a professorial tone.  
老人决定，打个比方，他得把他们俩都带回京都，于是他采用了教授的口吻。

"Listen to me," he said. "You'll always be my student, so you still have a chance to learn again."  
"听我说，"他说。"你永远都是我的学生，所以你还有机会重新学习。"

Gendo said nothing. 源堂一言不发。

"I teach everyone and grade them all," the old man said, snuffing out the cigarette into the ashtray. "I tried my best, but should they fail, I give them a fair chance by making up at the next semester, even if they repeat the course all over again."  
"我教所有人，也给他们评分，"老人说着，将烟头掐灭在烟灰缸里。"我已尽力，但若他们不及格，我会给他们公平的机会，让他们在下个学期补考，哪怕他们得重修这门课。"

"Why are you saying this?"  
"你为何说这些？"

"I am not a god," Fuyutsuki said as he poured himself another cup of tea. "I'm just a fallible human being who understands how much it takes for someone to redeem himself. So, which is greater, a man born pure and holy, or a man who takes the hardest effort to cleanse himself of sin, to wean himself away from his dark upbringing and into enlightenment? Think about it."  
"我不是神，" 冬月说道，一边为自己又倒了一杯茶。"我只是个会犯错的人，明白一个人要自我救赎需要付出多少。那么，一个天生纯洁神圣的人和一个竭尽全力洗净罪孽，摆脱黑暗成长环境走向启蒙的人，哪个更伟大呢？好好想想吧。"

Fuyutsuki then drank, before standing up from his seat.  
冬月随后喝了一口茶，然后从座位上站了起来。

"I'll give you a few minutes to reflect," he said, but paused and added, "Also… do you wish to talk to your son?"  
"我给你几分钟时间思考，" 他说，但停顿了一下又补充道，"另外……你想和你的儿子谈谈吗？"

Meanwhile, in the synchro test facility, Ritsuko was standing right behind her workstation, which was at the moment connected directly to the MAGI. Outside the control room, she could see Kaworu's Entry Plug, half-immersed in coolant, and the top of the Plug had hundreds of cables and hoses connected.  
与此同时，在同步测试设施内，律子正站在她的工作站后方，此刻该站直接连接着 MAGI 系统。在控制室外，她可以看到真嗣的插入栓半浸在冷却液中，插入栓顶部连接着数百根电缆和软管。

Below the surface of the coolant pool was one of three remaining simulation bodies that managed to escape unscathed by a microbial Angel attack months before, as they were stored separately at the time. The simulation bodies themselves were leftovers from early attempts at creating the Evas; biologically they resemble and function like the real thing, except they were all headless and limbless.  
冷却池水面下是三具幸存的模拟躯体之一，它们在数月前的微生物型使徒攻击中幸免于难，因为当时它们被分开存放。这些模拟躯体源自早期制造 EVA 的尝试；从生物学角度看，它们与真正的 EVA 相似并具备相同功能，只不过全都没有头和四肢。

Standing besides her was Asuka, watching everything intently. She was hoping to learn much from Kaworu, as she hasn't seen him practice in the simulator.  
站在她身旁的是明日香，正全神贯注地观察着一切。她希望能从真嗣那里学到很多，因为她还未曾见过他在模拟器中练习。

Not far from them was Misato, sitting on a chair, right behind Maya, who was busy readjusting the system parameters; Rei likewise was sitting alongside the older woman, nursing her cup of tea and watching quietly.  
不远处是美里，坐在椅子上，就在正在重新调整系统参数的摩耶身后；丽同样坐在年长女性旁边，捧着她的茶杯，静静地观看着。

There were also a dozen more technicians in the control room, all making final adjustments; their fingers clacking on the keyboards, eyes alternately looking down at the pool below and going back to their monitors.  
控制室里还有十几名技术人员，都在做最后的调整；他们的手指在键盘上敲击，眼睛时而俯视下方的水池，时而回到显示器上。

On one of the displays providing a video feed from the Plug interior, Kaworu was clad in his black-and-blue Plug Suit, calmly sitting in the cockpit, breathing in the fresh infusion of oxygen in LCL that filled up the inside three minutes ago.  
其中一个显示器提供从插入栓内部传来的视频，薰身穿蓝黑相间的插入栓服，平静地坐在驾驶舱内，呼吸着三分钟前充满内部的 LCL 中新鲜注入的氧气。

"Okay," Ritsuko said into the microphone. "Listen up."  
“好的，”律子对着麦克风说道，“大家注意听。”

Kaworu nodded. 薰点了点头。

"For now, you'll have to undergo a harmonics test, which means that we have to establish a initial baseline datum for an hour or so before you, Shinji and Asuka have to dance together on the floor."  
“目前，你们需要进行一次谐波测试，这意味着我们得先建立一个初始基准数据，大约一小时左右，然后你、真嗣和明日香需要在地板上一起跳舞。”

"What?"

"Sorry," Ritsuko apologized before she chuckled. "I mean, you'll go up against two of them, and that's when we'll start recording your combat data, and then use the data to create nine simulacrums of those MPs."  
"抱歉，" 赤木律子道歉后轻笑了一声。"我的意思是，你将同时面对他们中的两个，那时我们才开始记录你的战斗数据，然后利用这些数据制作出九个那些 MP 的模拟体。"

"I see," Kaworu said. "What about the data last time?"  
"我明白了，" 渚薰说。"那上次的数据显示如何？"

Ritsuko shook her head. "Nope, I don't think they'll apply. Instead we'll have to make you go through a fine comb this time, with more data points to build up a clear and accurate picture of your fighting capacity so that the MAGI can use all of this to construct a near-exact replica of the Dummy Plug."  
赤木律子摇了摇头。"不，我认为那些数据不适用。这次我们必须对你进行更细致的梳理，收集更多数据点，以构建出你战斗能力的清晰准确图像，这样 MAGI 才能利用所有这些信息来构建一个近乎精确的 Dummy Plug 复制品。"

"What about you?" "那你呢？"

"While you sit right there, we'll have to code the whole recording program from scratch, which should be able to obtain your brain waves while all three of you go through the practice session, mano-a-mano. By the way, for the dress rehearsal, we'll be using the initial build data from Unit Four, which was supposed to be your assigned Eva."  
"你就在那儿坐着，我们得从头开始编写整个录音程序，它能获取你们三人在一对一练习时的大脑波形。顺便说一下，彩排时我们将使用四号机最初的构建数据，那本应是分配给你的 Eva。"

"Yes," Kaworu said. "And… How long that rehearsal would take?"  
"是的，" Kaworu 说。"那么…彩排需要多长时间？"

"Asides from sparring," Ritsuko said. "All three of you will also have to do some serious target practice with simulated Angels, which would take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour, with five to ten minutes per round, and three minutes for a breather after five rounds. I'll have to throw every possible battle scenario that should be able to stimulate your brain hard enough and generate lots of neural activity. As if it's not enough, I'll set the enemy AI difficulty at the highest possible level. Is that clear?"  
"除了对练，" 律子说。"你们三人还得进行一些针对模拟使徒的严肃射击训练，每轮耗时五到十分钟，五轮后休息三分钟，总共需要三十分钟到一个小时。我得抛出所有可能的战斗场景，足以充分刺激你们的大脑，产生大量神经活动。不仅如此，我还会将敌方 AI 难度设置为最高级别。清楚了吗？"

"Roger," Kaworu agreed as he softly tugged the butterfly controls and squirmed a bit in his seat for comfort.  
"明白，" 渚同意道，他轻轻拉动蝴蝶控制器，稍微调整了一下座位以求舒适。

"Only then you'll spar against that married couple, nine against two… Any further questions?"  
"之后你们将与那对已婚夫妇进行对练，九对二……还有其他问题吗？"

Kaworu shook his head. "No."  
渚薰摇了摇头。"不。"

"Okay, then," Ritsuko said, "Let's get started."  
"好吧，那么，"赤木律子说，"我们开始吧。"

---

Shinji walked into the interrogation room, uncertainty and discomfort marked on the young man's face, as he was shivering inside, but steeling himself to prepare for their very first conversation since his father's arrest and detention.  
真嗣走进审讯室，年轻的脸上写满了不确定和不适，他内心颤抖，却强打精神准备迎接自父亲被捕和拘留以来的首次对话。

The young man then sat down on the empty folding chair, facing Gendo, the former Commander looking glum and bitter.  
年轻人随后坐在那张空着的折叠椅上，面对着源渡，这位前指挥官显得忧郁而苦涩。

Now father and son were trying to find the right words to initiate the exchange. The old man could also feel the tension in the air, and then Gendo was the first to speak.  
现在，父子俩正试图找到合适的开场白来开始对话。老人也能感受到空气中的紧张气氛，随后源渡率先开口。

"I've must failed, right?" he said, speaking in a low voice.  
“我一定是失败了，对吧？”他低声说道。

Shinji blinked. "What?"

"You don't want to follow me, but otherwise you get going by listening to someone else other than me," Gendo answered. "Words that trigger your impulses to fight on their behalf, like 'I beg you', 'pilot it', 'I believe in you'…"  
"你不想跟随我，但如果不听我的，你就会被别人的话牵着鼻子走，" 碇回答道。"那些激发你为他们而战的冲动的话语，比如'我求你'，'去驾驶它'，'我相信你'…"

There was a three-word sentence that made Gendo pause for a moment, and Shinji noticed the older man's discomfiture, before saying with his willpower, "…and 'I love you'."  
有一个三字短语让碇停顿了一下，真嗣注意到了这个年长男人的不安，然后坚定地说道，"…还有'我爱你'。"

Deciding that picking up the bat and stepping up to the batting plate was better than warming the bench throughout the whole game in the dugout, Shinji said, "What's wrong with me fighting for them?"  
真嗣决定拿起球棒站上击球位，总比整场比赛都坐在替补席上要好，于是他说："我为他们而战有什么不对吗？"

Gendo sighed. 源度叹了口气。

"I can't bring myself to love you as a son," he bitterly said. "Never felt love in my whole life."  
"我无法像爱儿子一样爱你，"他苦涩地说道，"我一生中从未感受过爱。"

"But what about Mother?" Shinji asked. "I thought you—"  
"那母亲呢？"真嗣问道，"我以为你——"

"From the moment you came into this wretched world," Gendo said, interrupting, "your mother's affection for you made me jealous."  
“从你踏入这个可憎的世界那一刻起，”源渡打断道，“你母亲对你的爱让我嫉妒。”

Shinji frowned. "What?"

Gendo leaned over the table, his eyes staring right at Shinji's, as if he wanted to make it damn clear and focused for him to understand the loss and the pain he had bottled up for years.  
源渡俯身靠在桌子上，双眼直视真嗣的眼睛，仿佛要让他彻底明白并集中注意力去感受多年来他压抑的失落与痛苦。

"Your mother was my salvation," Gendo said. "She was my support, my hope, the only person whom I can connect with after all the time I was denied affection but given hatred, chaos and pain, all the while I was then crawling on my knees in the darkness, so she's the only one I was able to thank God for that one piece of mercy given to me.  
“你母亲是我的救赎，”源渡说，“她是我的支柱，我的希望，是我被剥夺爱意、只得到仇恨、混乱和痛苦后，唯一能与之相连的人。在黑暗中匍匐前行时，她是唯一一个我能感谢上帝赐予我那一点仁慈的人。”

"I married her because… not because she was connected to SEELE and gave me everything I wanted, but yes, she also pulled me out of the quagmire of hell that was my old life."  
"我娶她是因为……并非因为她与 SEELE 有关联并给予了我所渴望的一切，而是因为她确实将我从那如同地狱泥潭的旧生活中拉了出来。"

Shinji was silent but listening, never taking his eyes off.  
真嗣沉默着，却始终在聆听，目光未曾离开。

"Yet in a blink of the eye," Gendo went on, "she was taken away. Snuffed like a candle, which left me cursing God and asking why He had to give, but also to take away. So why? Why does He keep on doing this, the carrot-and-stick act? Is this a punishment for all mankind? Are we nothing but ants to be stepped on at His cruel leisure?"  
"然而转瞬之间，" 源渡继续说道，"她就被夺走了。如同烛火被吹灭，这让我咒骂上帝，质问为何他既要给予，又要夺走。那么，为何？为何他不断上演这种胡萝卜加大棒的把戏？这是对全人类的惩罚吗？我们难道只是他残忍闲暇时随意践踏的蚂蚁吗？"

"If I remember, we were taught that we came from dust, and soon will return to it," Shinji said, dimly recalling the words of a village priest not so long ago before coming to Tokyo-3.  
"如果我没记错，我们曾被教导说我们来自尘土，不久也将归于尘土，" 真嗣说道，隐约记起不久前在来到第三新东京市之前，村中牧师的话语。

"Nothing is permanent," Gendo said. "Everything in this world can be taken away. Soon Keel will have his victory and all mankind will be destroyed. That is why I have undertaken to create and build up this project, to seize that power to decide life and death, to beat God at His game."  
"没有什么是永恒的，" 碇源堂说。"这个世界上的每一样东西都可能被夺走。很快，基尔就会取得他的胜利，全人类都将被毁灭。这就是为什么我着手创建并推进这个项目，为了掌握决定生死的力量，为了在这场游戏中击败上帝。

Shinji shook his head.  
真嗣摇了摇头。

"But I'm here," Gendo said. "I've lost that game. You're supposed to avenge your mother for me, to fight God, and yet—"  
"但我在这里，" 碇源堂说。"我已经输了那场游戏。你本应为我向你母亲复仇，去与上帝抗争，然而——

"God has _nothing to do with this_," Shinji said, cutting him off. "It began with a _man_, and so with this disaster coming tomorrow to destroy everything, we as humans will also have to stop it, right here."  
"上帝与此无关，" 真嗣打断他说，"这一切始于一个人，而明天这场灾难即将摧毁一切，我们作为人类也必须在这里阻止它。"

"Keel is relentless," Gendo said, "which is why you have Unit One to control."  
"基尔是毫不留情的，" 源堂说，"这就是为什么你需要控制初号机。"

"I know."

"You should be able to comprehend why I created Project E, and at the same time my feelings. You'll pilot soon, but I have no hope for this world, and I still have my contempt for it."  
"你应该能理解我为何创建 E 计划，同时也能感受到我的情感。你很快就要驾驶了，但我对这个世界没有希望，我依然对它抱有轻蔑。"

A moment of silence settled on both father and son, letting the words sink in.  
父子间陷入了一阵沉默，让这些话慢慢沉淀。

"Father," Shinji said.

"Yes?"

"I've learned many things," the young man said. "Kaworu was a good teacher to me, making me able to accept for what I am in this world, my purpose, and my reasons for living, and therefore I was also able to love myself, and to invest in hope."  
“我学到了很多，”年轻人说，“渚薰对我来说是个好老师，让我能够接受自己在这个世界上的存在，我的使命，以及我活着的理由，因此我也能够爱自己，并寄希望于未来。”

Gendo said as if wounded. "Why do you have to put much of your faith in that Angel?"  
碇源堂仿佛受了伤似的说：“为什么你要把那么多信仰寄托在那个使徒身上？”

"In the same way he was able to place his trust in humanity, rather than destroying them as he was supposed to do."  
"正如他能够信任人类，而不是像他本应做的那样毁灭他们。"

The older Ikari bitterly laughed. "Absurd," he chided. "He played you around like a fool. Even demons can quote the Bible if they wish to."  
年长的碇苦笑道：“荒谬，”他斥责道，“他把你耍得像个傻子。即使是恶魔，如果他们愿意，也能引用圣经。”

"I'm not bullshitting this," Shinji objected without humor. "What love he felt for Rei was real. Out of this love he chose to disobey Lorenz because of the hope he found in people, people who wish for a better world to live in than to escape from it."  
"我不是在胡说八道，"真嗣严肃地反驳道，"他对绫波的爱是真切的。正是出于这份爱，他选择违抗洛伦兹，因为他从人们身上找到了希望，这些人渴望生活在一个比逃离更好的世界里。"

"He could still betray you at the last minute," Gendo said, trying to contradict him.  
"他仍有可能在最后一刻背叛你，" 源渡试图反驳他。

"Kaworu was very sincere even to the point I almost killed him," Shinji said with conviction and clarity. "Now he willed himself to join the battle alongside us on our behalf, because I believe that unlike before he'll want humanity be given a fighting chance, and we have suffered enough for too long."  
"渚薰非常真诚，甚至到了我差点杀掉他的地步，" 真嗣坚定而清晰地说道，"现在他自愿加入战斗，与我们并肩作战，因为我相信，与以往不同，他希望给人类一个争取胜利的机会，我们已经承受了太久的苦难。"

Internally, Gendo was shocked at Shinji's mature firmness and choice of words, something that he had not seen in him in years, leaving him to wonder if he had truly grown up, more than ever he could imagine.  
内心深处，源渡对真嗣成熟坚定的态度和措辞感到震惊，这是他多年来未曾在真嗣身上见过的，这让他不禁思考，真嗣是否真的已经长大，超出了他所能想象的程度。

"I understood my purpose in this world, and so you must," Shinji went on. "I'm not the son you used to look down. I used to hate myself, and think of running away; sometimes I wished to die just because I'm weak inside. I never wanted this being involved here and then, to pilot Eva, but now I have a reason to change, to think about life and its beauty all the while making it worthwhile."  
"我明白了自己在这个世界上的使命，你也必须如此，" 真嗣继续说道。"我不再是那个你曾经俯视的儿子。我曾经憎恨自己，想过逃离；有时我甚至希望死去，只因我内心软弱。我从未想过要卷入这里，成为 Eva 的驾驶员，但现在我有理由改变，思考生命的意义，并让它变得有价值。"

"But…"

"I want to live and to love, because there's more to life than just Eva," Shinji said. "That'll be my reason to fight and defeat not God but a lunatic's delusion. Now if you really love Mother, if you want to take a stand, then I'm sure she'll love you more if you could just…"  
"我想活下去，去爱，因为生命不仅仅只有 Eva，" 真嗣说。"那将是我战斗的理由，不是对抗神，而是击败一个疯子的妄想。现在，如果你真的爱母亲，如果你想站出来，那么我相信，如果你能做到……"

Gendo can only stare at Shinji with distraught eyes, eyes that once used to be hidden behind amber, those eyes that were once cold, harsh and unforgiving, and even able to pass cruel judgment without a word.  
碇源堂只能用痛苦的眼神盯着真嗣，那双曾经隐藏在琥珀色后的眼睛，曾经冰冷、严厉且毫不宽容的眼睛，甚至能在不发一言的情况下做出残酷的判决。

For a second, Shinji hesitated as if to taste the words before speaking them out, with his eyes expressing a pleading need:  
有那么一瞬间，真嗣犹豫了，仿佛在品味这些话之后才说出口，他的眼神流露出恳求的需要：

"Father, you have to learn _how to let go._"  
“父亲，您必须学会放手。”

---

As Kaworu silently sat in the Entry Plug, getting his harmonics checked over through the data acquisition phase, and while Misato and Ritsuko were talking over coffee, discussing about how to create a mock-up version of the Mass-Production Evas, Rei and Asuka were conversing about the confrontation at the holographic communications room.  
当渚薰静静地坐在插入栓中，通过数据采集阶段进行谐波检查时，美里和律子正在喝着咖啡讨论如何制作量产型 EVA 的模拟版本，而绫波和明日香则在全息通讯室里谈论着那场对峙。

"I expected a James Bond villain," Asuka said. "But… I don't know, except he's more like Doctor Evil."  
"我以为会是詹姆斯·邦德电影里的反派，" 明日香说。"但…我不知道，他更像《王牌大贱谍》里的邪恶博士。"

"Who are they?" Rei asked.  
"他们是谁？" 绫波问。"

"Oops, sorry," Asuka apologized. "I didn't know you're hardly into movies or pop culture, but simply put, James Bond is a fictional British spy who's called in to save the world from a bunch of baddies, while Doctor Evil is a villain from a movie called _Austin Powers_, and… if my memory serves me right, Doctor Evil was based on a Bond arch-enemy named Blofeld."  
"哎呀，抱歉，" 明日香道歉道。"我不知道你对电影或流行文化了解不多，简单来说，詹姆斯·邦德是一个虚构的英国间谍，他被召来拯救世界免受一群坏蛋的威胁，而邪恶博士是《王牌大贱谍》电影中的反派，而且…如果我没记错的话，邪恶博士是根据邦德系列中的一个主要敌人布洛菲尔德改编的。"

Rei nodded. "I see."  
丽点点头。“我明白了。”

"Anyway, he looks damn old, as if he really saw the last world war, fought in it, and even now he still keeps himself standing even at that age without having to rely on a crutch. You think it's a bit odd?"  
“话说回来，他看起来老得吓人，仿佛真的经历过上一次世界大战，还参与其中，甚至到了现在这个年纪，依然能不靠拐杖站立。你不觉得有点奇怪吗？”

Rei shrugged. "I did not notice anything out of the ordinary."  
丽耸耸肩。“我没发现有什么不寻常的。”

"Must be that, given the amount of influence he wields, Lorenz probably had an alloy spine stuck into him, and with the visor he's wearing, more likely Lorenz is a cyborg, which may explain why he's into the Instrumentality Project."  
"考虑到他所拥有的影响力，洛伦兹很可能被植入了合金脊椎，再加上他戴的面罩，更可能洛伦兹是个赛博格，这或许能解释他为何对集体化计划感兴趣。"

"It makes sense for him trying to seek out immortality," Rei said. "But at what price? If his manner of speech and how he expresses himself were to be gauged, then I suppose that he is clearly bent on accomplishing what he truly wants."  
"他追求永生是有道理的，"丽说，"但代价是什么？如果从他的言谈举止来判断，那么我认为他显然是铁了心要达成他真正想要的。"

"Sounds more like Shinji's father," Asuka said, "except the old fart is definitely a plutocrat, so if he can't rule over mortals in the physical world, why not rule in eternity, like _'better reign in hell than serve in heaven'_?"  
"听起来更像真嗣的父亲，"明日香说，"只不过那老头绝对是个富豪，所以如果他不能在现实世界统治凡人，为何不在永恒中统治，就像‘宁在地狱为王，不在天堂为仆’那样？"

"Who said that?" “谁说的？”

Asuka looked up, as though she was thinking. "John Milton. The phrase came from _Paradise Lost,_ and I heard it once in an English lecture back in college."  
明日香抬头，仿佛在回忆。“约翰·弥尔顿。这句话出自《失乐园》，我在大学时的一堂英语课上听过。”

Rei nodded. "I see."  
绫波点点头。“原来如此。”

"In that phrase, there are those who feel they rather be in control, masters of everything no matter they'll do good or harm, than to be chafed and bound by rules imposed by a supposed omnipotent being who doesn't exist in the physical world; they prefer to rewrite everything to their whim, their rules or just plain anarchy."  
"在那句话中，有些人宁愿掌控一切，无论他们的行为是好是坏，也不愿被一个在物质世界不存在的所谓全能存在所制定的规则束缚；他们更倾向于按照自己的意愿重写一切，制定自己的规则，或是彻底的无政府状态。"

"Yes, to be a demigod, if not God itself," Rei said. "It is an ultimate form of egomania and selfishness, hence very dangerous."  
"是的，成为半神，如果不是神本身，" 丽说。"这是极端的自我主义和自私，因此非常危险。"

"Rules and laws exist because humanity is supposed to be on top of the food chain, and he should be bound by the difference between right and wrong, to differentiate himself from animals, and yet the more rules and laws are written and imposed, the more people choose to disregard them because they feel that too many laws makes their lives complicated and restrained; for those folks they would rather make profit and put the food on the dinner table."  
"规则和法律的存在是因为人类应该处于食物链的顶端，他应该被是非之分所约束，以区别于动物，然而规则和法律越多，人们越选择忽视它们，因为他们觉得太多的法律使生活变得复杂和受限；对于那些人来说，他们宁愿谋取利益，让餐桌上有食物。"

"Laws were created to bring order from chaos," Rei said, "but never to cause burden. Yet through Instrumentality, it has become the intent of Lorenz to destroy God, by simplifying everything back to chaos, and thus promote devolution."  
"法律是为了从混乱中带来秩序而制定的，"丽说，"但绝不是为了造成负担。然而通过道具化，洛伦兹的意图变成了摧毁上帝，通过将一切简化回混乱，从而促进退化。"

"Simply put," Asuka replied. "He's fucking power-mad that he thinks we should go down onto our knees and drink his Jonestown Kool-Aid, that is, _hara-kiri_ with fruit punch."  
"简而言之，"明日香回答道。"他就是个权力狂，认为我们应该跪下来喝他的琼斯镇酷爱饮料，也就是带着水果味的切腹自尽。"

His father still not uttering a word since Shinji told him to let go, so the young man rose from his seat, as if being moved to urgency.  
自从真嗣告诉他放手后，他的父亲仍然一言不发，于是年轻人从座位上站了起来，仿佛被紧迫感所驱使。

"I'm sorry, but I'm supposed to leave now," Shinji said. "We need to do a lot of practice."  
"对不起，但我现在应该离开了，" 真嗣说。"我们还有很多练习要做。"

"Practice?" Gendo asked, thus breaking his self-imposed silence.  
"练习？" 源堂问道，打破了自我强加的沉默。"

"Yeah, we have to learn how to fight off Lorenz's army, which includes those fake Evas they could launch against us, the Mass-Production types, as Kaworu and Doctor Akagi told us about. They're supposed to be more advanced than anything we have here, but those Evas should have a weak spot or two… and I don't think I'll look at this as easy."  
"是的，我们得学会如何击退洛伦兹的军队，包括他们可能对我们发动的那些假 Eva，就是薰和赤木博士提到的量产型 Eva。它们应该比我们这里的任何东西都要先进，但那些 Eva 应该有一两个弱点……我不认为这会很容易。"

Shinji looked at the wall clock, and thought, _Still a few minutes to spare_. He then sat down again.  
真嗣看了看墙上的时钟，心想，还有几分钟时间。于是他又坐了下来。

Gendo blinked. "I thought you're leaving?"  
碇源堂眨了眨眼。"我以为你要走了？"

"Not yet," Shinji said. "Just a question about Mom… I still wonder why she fell for you back then, despite your personality."  
“还没，”真嗣说，“只是想问关于妈妈的事……我至今仍不明白，她当时为何会爱上你，尽管你的性格如此。”

The elder Ikari frowned, apparently uncomfortable with the question aimed at him as he racked his brain for an answer.  
碇源堂皱起眉头，显然对这个问题感到不适，他绞尽脑汁寻找答案。

_I was an animal back then, a beast who longed to reach for the stars,_ Gendo thought. _I was feared, hardly liked, never loved…_  
那时我就像一头野兽，一只渴望触及星辰的野兽，碇源堂心想。我被人畏惧，几乎不被人喜欢，从未被爱过……

"I don't know," Gendo answered, distraught and unable to fathom any further. "I should have asked her a long time ago. Maybe she saw something in me that I couldn't understand."  
“我不知道，”碇源堂回答，心烦意乱，无法再深思。“我早该问她的。也许她在我身上看到了一些我自己无法理解的东西。”

"Or she should've told you the truth," Shinji said. "Mom fell in love with you for a very good reason."  
"或者她本该告诉你真相，" 真嗣说。"妈妈爱上你是有充分理由的。"

"And what is it?" Gendo sounded skeptical.  
"那是什么理由？" 源堂听起来有些怀疑。"

"Since you said you had next to nothing, maybe Mom thought she saw the good inside your heart, and thus still worth saving as you were trying to swim but drowning instead, even if she might have been told everything to the contrary, like she didn't gave a damn but for you."  
"既然你说你几乎一无所有，也许妈妈认为她看到了你内心的善良，因此仍然值得拯救，就像你在努力游泳却反而溺水一样，即使有人告诉她一切相反的情况，比如她根本不在乎，但为了你。"

Shinji then stood up. "Call me wrong or naive," he said, "but there's enough time left to change your mind. Whatever crap you have done in the past, _you're still my father._"  
真嗣随后站了起来。“说我错也好，天真也罢，”他说，“但还有时间让你改变主意。无论你过去做了什么糟糕的事，你依然是我的父亲。”

The elder Ikari was instantly struck by those words. His arms suddenly sagged to the sides.  
老碇被这些话瞬间击中。他的双臂突然垂向两侧。

"But… You hate me," Gendo said in a pained tone, as if trying to punish himself. "Ritsuko hates me… everyone hates me. I am terrible, a _monster!_"  
“但是……你恨我，”碇司令痛苦地说，仿佛在自我惩罚。“律子恨我……每个人都恨我。我是个可怕的人，是个怪物！”

There was a momentary stillness as the last word echoed in their minds.  
最后一个字在他们脑海中回响，带来了一瞬间的静止。

"No," Shinji disagreed calmly, head shaking. "Not this time, for I finally heard much about your story, knew the truth and everything fell into place. So I'm not running away from this, nor I'm closing my heart – soon I have to stand on this ground even if I could die trying."  
“不，”真嗣平静地反驳，摇着头。“这次不会了，因为我终于听到了你的故事，了解了真相，一切都豁然开朗。所以我不会逃避，也不会封闭我的心——不久后我必须站在这片土地上，哪怕拼尽全力也在所不惜。”

Gendo sighed as he hung his head in dejection.  
碇源堂叹了口气，沮丧地低下头。

"You can go now," the older man said, voice almost cracking, cradling his face with palms, but not seeing Shinji walking up to the door.  
"你可以走了，"年长的男人说道，声音几乎要哽咽，双手捧着脸，却没有注意到真嗣正走向门口。

"Thank you, Father," Shinji said, looking back but with a small, beatific smile. "I hope you'll understand this time as much as I did."  
"谢谢你，父亲，"真嗣说道，回头望去，脸上带着一丝祥和的微笑。"我希望这次你能像我一样理解。"

Once Shinji walked out of the room and closed the door, for the first time in years since twelve and brooding in his bedroom, the older Ikari was shedding tears for real, sobbing like a child now, as he didn't expect his son to be completely changed… and eloquent.  
当真嗣走出房间并关上门后，自十二岁起就郁郁寡欢地待在卧室里的这些年里，碇源堂第一次真正流下了眼泪，像个孩子一样抽泣着，因为他没想到自己的儿子会完全改变……而且如此能言善辩。

**Author's Notes:**

*_in this manuscript, the origins and content of the controversial_ Dossiers Secret _were slightly altered for the fictional storyline. For more information, you can search it but caveat emptor, what you get might give you a mixed reaction._

Peeps… Forgive me for being this damn late, as it took me months since the last upload, thinking about writing this, looking for ideas on how to open this chapter, visualizing it, and in between complete disruptions and distractions (it ain't fun writing when being disrupted several times in a day when you actually wanted enough quiet time to think about prose before committing them to the drive), gone through several revisions while trying not to go overboard.  
各位……请原谅我如此迟延，距离上次更新已过去数月，期间我一直在思考如何撰写这一章，寻找开篇的灵感，构思画面，同时还要应对各种干扰和分心（在一天中多次被打断，实在不是写作的乐趣，尤其是在你渴望有足够安静的时间来思考文句，再将它们付诸笔端时），经历了多次修订，力求不过于偏离正轨。

Until a friend posted this on Facebook about three weeks ago:  
直到三周前，一位朋友在 Facebook 上发布了这个：

"_I have this feeling of dread that all the characters in my unfinished stories, all these characters I breathed life into but whose stories I never finished, they will one day come out to get me. So I must finish this one story. I must finish her story. So I would have at least one ally when the time comes that all my little darlings come out to kill me."_  
"我有一种不祥的预感，那些我赋予生命却未曾完成故事的角色们，总有一天会来找我算账。所以我必须完成这个故事，我必须完成她的故事。这样，当所有我心爱的小家伙们出来追杀我时，我至少还有一个盟友。"

That kicker got me off my ass, and now, this is it and I've done Numero 47, helped along with several albums worth of Two Steps from Hell.  
那个刺激让我振作起来，现在，这就是了，我已经完成了第 47 号作品，多亏了几张 Two Steps from Hell 的专辑助力。

As usual, comments and criticisms are welcome, and I'll try to answer them if possible.  
一如既往，欢迎评论和批评，我会尽力回复。

Thank you guys... Now I have to set my mind on writing the next chapter, the one where I have to pit the "married couple" against Kaworu.  
谢谢大家...现在我得集中精力写下一章了，那章里我得让“已婚夫妇”对阵渚薰。
