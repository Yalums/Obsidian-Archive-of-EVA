Author's note: It should be clear shortly if it's not already, but this picks up right where End of Evangelion left off. I know, it's not an original premise at all, and it's probably been beaten into the ground, but this story's been in my head for a while and I just wanted to get it down on paper. Or... in pixels. So, if you want, read on and enjoy yourself.
作者注：如果还不明显的话，很快就会清楚了，本文紧接《新世纪福音战士剧场版：Air/真心为你》之后。我知道，这绝非新颖的构思，或许早已被人写烂，但这个故事在我脑海中萦绕已久，我只是想将其付诸笔端。或者说……呈现在像素之间。那么，若您愿意，请继续阅读，尽情享受。

I'm rating it M. It's probably skirting the line between T and M, but I want to be safe.
我将其评级为 M。它可能介于 T 和 M 之间，但我想确保安全。

I don't own Evangelion. If I did, I wouldn't need this disclaimer.
我并不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。如果我有，就不需要这个免责声明了。

### Chapter 01 Intro: Larghetto 
引子：稍慢板

Pain.

Pain. Hot pain, searing through my viscera. Jagged teeth, tearing claws and mindless laughter. Intestines stretching, limbs as trophies. Screaming does nothing. Helpless.
痛苦。灼热的痛楚，穿透我的内脏。尖锐的牙齿，撕裂的利爪，以及无意识的笑声。肠子被拉扯，四肢成了战利品。尖叫无济于事。无助。

I'm disappearing. No, I'm already gone? World-burning rage, helpless. Vultures, white vultures, the halo of the sun. Circling shadows above; I'm squinting. The heartbeat of some great beast, pounding thunder-like, deafening, and the beast is me.
我正在消失。不，我已经消失了？世界焚烧般的愤怒，无助。秃鹫，白色的秃鹫，太阳的光环。头顶盘旋的阴影；我眯着眼。某种巨兽的心跳，雷鸣般轰响，震耳欲聋，而那巨兽就是我。

No, not me; gone. Sun's going dark, be gone soon. Someone... someone I know, close by. Someone warm. Not enough, though. Too little, too late.
不，不是我；已经离去。太阳正黯淡，很快就会消失。某人……我认识的人，就在附近。某个温暖的人。但不够，太少，太迟。

Darkness. Blue eyes, blinking, pupils narrowing, startled. A kitchen? A familiar place.
黑暗。蓝色的眼睛，眨动，瞳孔收缩，惊愕。一个厨房？一个熟悉的地方。

Cold words now, desperate words, pleas. Sharp words, frost-slicked steel. They're designed to hurt, to cause what I feel. An offer, a tantrum, refusal. Neither pity nor quarter, barely above a whisper.
冰冷的言语，绝望的恳求。尖锐的话语，如霜滑的钢铁。它们旨在伤害，引发我所感受的痛苦。一个提议，一场脾气发作，拒绝。既无怜悯也无宽恕，仅是低语。

Hands grasping now, not my hands, squeezing. Choking. Lights fading again, cold coming again, but no pain this time. No fighting. The high road. Grunting, roaring, darkness.
手在抓握，却非我的手，紧捏着。窒息感。灯光再次黯淡，寒意再次袭来，但这次没有痛苦。没有挣扎。那是条高路。喘息，咆哮，陷入黑暗。

Another pair of eyes, eyes all over, watching, judging. Some are mine. What is inside comes out, dirty, cowering, a panting wreck. Hate it. Hate it so much. Can see theirs too, shameful and smothered, but hate it. Have to get out, have to...
又一双眼睛，到处都是眼睛，注视着，评判着。有些是我自己的。内心涌出的东西，肮脏，畏缩，喘息着支离破碎。厌恶它。如此厌恶。必须逃离，必须……

Water. A drop, echoing. 水。一滴，回响着。

Mama? Mama loves me. 妈妈？妈妈爱我。

Watchers back, clawing, prying, but I fight. I see as through a prism of hearts, not what I want, and I fight, and I flee. Flee through darkness.
监视者们回溯，抓挠，窥探，但我奋力抵抗。我透过心之棱镜观望，非我所愿，我抵抗，我逃离。在黑暗中逃亡。

Mama loves me. But Mama's gone now.
妈妈爱我。但妈妈已经不在了。

Someone else isn't. Someone, something warm. Spiky and warm, someone familiar, and I swim through what isn't there, swim away, swim towards a solid anchor piercing the veil and find that I can't breathe. Something's around my neck, and I can't move.
还有别人在。某个温暖的存在。刺痛而温暖，某个熟悉的人，我在虚无中游弋，游离，游向一个穿透帷幕的坚实锚点，却发现我无法呼吸。有什么东西缠绕在我的脖子上，我动弹不得。

He's strangling me. Again.
他在勒我。又一次。

I'm not even angry. I'm dying again, feeling the sands slip through numb fingers once more, and I'm not mad, because Mama loves me. And because we hurt each other. Even now I can feel it, feel his rage and pain, sharp as a knife in my womb.
我甚至不感到愤怒。我又一次濒临死亡，感受着沙粒从麻木的指间滑落，而我并不生气，因为妈妈爱我。也因为彼此伤害过。即便此刻，我仍能感受到，感受到他的愤怒与痛苦，尖锐如刀，刺入我的子宫。

Sky above, nothing but a dark blur. My fingers twitch, all the more I can move now. Eyes burning, muscles straining, I lift a hand. Lift it and touch his face. Want to feel something before I go. Loss. Things aren't... didn't have to be this way. Want him to know.
头顶的天空，不过是一片模糊的黑暗。我的手指抽动着，这是我如今能做的全部动作。眼睛灼痛，肌肉紧绷，我举起一只手。举起它，触摸他的脸庞。想在离去前感受些什么。失落。事情本不必如此……不必走到这一步。想让他明白。

Fingers trail along a smooth cheek, caressing, but the effort is too much, the weight too heavy. My hand falls. Wind roars somewhere despite the stillness, and the too-bright stars go dim.
手指沿着光滑的面颊轻抚，试图抚慰，但力气已尽，重负难承。我的手垂落下来。尽管四周静谧，风却在某处咆哮，过于明亮的星光也黯淡了。

Exhausted, I collapse onto the sand and simply lie there for a long time. Just a few meters away, the sea laps patiently against the sand. It's red, now. The water is red. LCL. The spray has already marked the cross I put up for Misato, leaving premature signs of age.
筋疲力尽，我倒在沙滩上，久久地躺在那里。几米开外，海水耐心地拍打着沙滩。现在，海水是红色的。那是 LCL。浪花已经在我为美里立起的十字架上留下了早衰的痕迹。

Something draws my attention to the side, and with effort I roll my head to face that way, staring out over the water. Rei is floating there, I see. Just... hovering in place, leaving a tiny shadow on the rippling surface of the water below. She's watching me.
有什么东西吸引我侧目，费力地转头望向那边，凝视着水面。丽在那里漂浮着，我看见了。就那样……悬停不动，在水面波纹下投下微小的影子。她在注视着我。

I stare back. I don't know what you want me to do, Rei. I don't know that I'd do it if I did. I'm tired. Tired of all this. I've taken your lessons to heart, but... it's hard. It's hard and I'm tired.
我回望着她。我不知道你想让我做什么，丽。即便知道，我也不确定自己会去做。我累了。厌倦了这一切。我已将你的教诲铭记于心，但……这很难。太难了，我感到疲惫。

The silence stretches. I find myself wondering if she's really there at all. Her school uniform should seem out of place in the crumbling wreckage of the world, but I can't summon the will to laugh. Mirth seems inappropriate now in any case.
沉默在蔓延。我开始怀疑她是否真的存在。她的校服本应与这世界废墟格格不入，但我却无力发出笑声。无论如何，此刻的欢愉似乎都不合时宜。

Silence, but for the waves. I blink, and she's gone.
唯有波浪声打破寂静。我眨了眨眼，她已消失无踪。

For a time I just continue staring, but after a moment I sigh, pushing myself laboriously upright. The sea is a monument to apocalyptic pain now, a half-submerged temple to hubris and failed plans. Rough statues stick out from the waves at odd intervals, some slanting drunkenly, the petrified remains of the mass-produced Eva series. Somewhere in the distance, water laps against an enormous stone likeness of half of Rei's wide-eyed face. Is she staring at me? I don't think so. I'd laugh if I had the energy for it.
我一时只是继续凝视，但片刻后我叹了口气，费力地让自己坐起来。大海如今成了末日痛苦的纪念碑，一座半沉的傲慢与失败计划的庙宇。粗糙的雕像在波浪中不时冒出，有些倾斜得醉醺醺的，是量产型 Eva 系列的石化遗骸。远处某处，水波轻拍着半张绫波丽睁大眼睛的巨大石像。她在看我吗？我想不是。如果我有那份力气，我会笑出声来。

At the thought, my eyes flicker sideways again, but it's no use, of course. She's gone. Maybe she was never there.
想到这里，我的目光再次向旁边闪烁，但当然，这是徒劳的。她已经走了。或许她从未存在过。

Everything's so red now. The water, the arc of souls in the sky. The plugsuit and hair of the girl next to me.
现在一切都如此鲜红。海水，天空中灵魂的弧线。我身边女孩的驾驶服和头发。

Asuka's lying there on her back, her face about as peaceful as I've ever seen it. I think she's alive. I dragged her out of the water not ten minutes ago and she was breathing then.
明日香仰面躺在那里，她的脸庞是我见过的最平静的样子。我想她还活着。不到十分钟前，我从水中把她拖出来时，她还在呼吸。

She's got a bandage over one eye, and matching ones on her right hand and arm where the suit has been cut away. By whom, I couldn't tell you. I don't know where the bandages came from either, but like Rei's uniform, like Rei herself, there's really no gain in wondering. It's just there.
她的一只眼睛上缠着绷带，右手和手臂上也缠着相同的绷带，那里的战斗服已被割开。是谁做的，我无从得知。我也不清楚这些绷带从何而来，但就像绫波的制服，就像绫波本人一样，深究这些并无意义。它们就那样存在着。

Abruptly and without reason, my numbness shatters into rage just from looking at Asuka. All the suffering I've suffered at her hands, at everyone's hands, comes crashing home, drawing lips from my teeth in a feral snarl. She's nothing but a point source of pain. Even Instrumentality didn't seem to change her either; I was desperate then, seeking help from anyone, but she wouldn't lift a goddamn finger to save my life when I needed it. All because I needed help anyone could give, not just her.
毫无预兆地，仅仅因为看着明日香，我那麻木的心突然碎裂成愤怒。她给我带来的所有痛苦，所有人给我带来的痛苦，如潮水般涌来，让我不由自主地露出野兽般的咆哮。她不过是痛苦的源头。甚至连人类补完计划似乎也没能改变她；那时我绝望至极，向任何人寻求帮助，但她在我最需要的时候连一根手指都不愿伸出救我。只因为我需要的帮助是任何人都能给予的，而不只是她。

My limbs move of their own accord, climbing, reaching. Squeezing. As I straddle her hips and start strangling her, I can't help but suspect with a flash of black humor that this must be starting to get routine for her now. She's nothing but pain, and she can't stand me, and really, I've just had enough of her shit. No more. My thumbs meet over her Adam's apple and push in; my teeth grind.
我的四肢不由自主地动起来，攀爬，抓握。挤压。当我跨坐在她腰间开始掐她时，我忍不住带着一丝黑色幽默怀疑，这对她来说恐怕已经成了家常便饭。她就是痛苦本身，她无法忍受我，而我，真的受够了她的所作所为。够了。我的拇指在她的喉结上相遇并用力按下；我的牙齿紧咬。

One blue eye stares unblinking at the heavens. One bandaged hand twitches, then rises to touch my face. No, to caress.
一只蓝眼睛凝视着天空，不眨眼。一只缠着绷带的手抽搐了一下，然后抬起，触碰我的脸。不，是轻抚。

I freeze, relax. Waves whisper against the shore.
我僵住，又放松。海浪轻声拍打着岸边。

Fingers slide, then drop back to the sand. I blink. As quickly as it came, my rage disappears, leaving me a shaking wreck. Hot liquid trickles down my cheeks, drops onto her face, her lips, but she doesn't stir.
手指滑过，又落回沙地。我眨了眨眼。怒气来得快去得也快，留下我颤抖不已。滚烫的液体顺着我的脸颊流下，滴落在她的脸上，她的唇上，但她没有醒来。

Does she know what she's doing? Does she even... but how couldn't she? A gesture like that is too specific to be reflex. She knows.
她知道自己正在做什么吗？她甚至...但怎么可能不知道？那样的动作太过具体，不可能是本能反应。她知道。

It's too much. Tears blur my vision and I collapse atop her, unable to stop the sobs now wracking my body. What... what the hell is wrong with me? Earlier today I made a choice. Life implies pain, as Rei explained; you can't have one without the other. And shortly after that entire ordeal, when confronted with pain, what's the first thing I do? Run from it. Choke it away.
这太过了。泪水模糊了我的视线，我瘫倒在她身上，无法抑制此刻撕扯我身体的啜泣。我……我到底是怎么了？今天早些时候，我做出了一个选择。正如绫所解释的，生活意味着痛苦；两者不可分割。而在那整个事件之后不久，面对痛苦时，我首先做了什么？逃避它。试图扼杀它。

Did Rei put her here, I wonder, just to see what I'd do? To test me? If so, I've failed. I thought I'd grown up somewhat during Instrumentality, but clearly that's not the case, or at least not to any significant degree. Or maybe I brought here here. No... I think I'd remember that.
我在想，是绫把她放在这里的吗，只是为了看看我会怎么做？为了考验我？如果是这样，我失败了。我以为在人类补完计划期间我有所成长，但显然并非如此，或者至少没有达到任何显著的程度。或者可能是我把她带到这里来的。不……我想我会记得的。

"How disgusting." Her voice is low, a murmur, and hoarse from being strangled.
"真令人作呕。"她的声音低沉，像是在耳语，因被勒颈而沙哑。

I just... I can't run from pain anymore. I owe it to her as much as myself to change. My God, I almost killed her.
我只是……我再也不能逃避痛苦了。为了她，也为了我自己，我必须改变。我的天，我差点杀了她。

Long moments pass, but Shinji continues to cry. That's not really what I wanted to see on coming back here, and I kind of wish he would stop. He's just a trembling weight on my thighs, curled up and shaking and gasping. And as strange as it is to realize this... I don't get it. I didn't mean to upset him, but if it's made him regret all the stuff he did to me... so much the better, I suppose.
时间缓缓流逝，但真嗣仍在哭泣。这并非我回到这里想看到的景象，我有些希望他能停止。他只是蜷缩在我大腿上颤抖的重量，蜷曲着身体，颤抖着，喘息着。尽管意识到这一点很奇怪...我不明白。我并非有意让他难过，但如果这让他后悔对我所做的一切...我想，这样也好。

Eventually he half-falls off me and crawls a short distance away along the sand. There he stops and plants his face in his hands, but the tears continue, as do the gasping sobs that suggest he's doing his damnedest not to lose it altogether.
最终，他半滑落下来，沿着沙滩爬行了一小段距离。在那里，他停下，双手掩面，但泪水依旧，伴随着竭力抑制却仍泄露的啜泣声，仿佛他正拼命不让自己彻底崩溃。

With him no longer restraining me, I sit up. Or try to; it's harder than I was expecting. A consequence of being... away, maybe. With a grimace I'm able to push myself up to a seated position, though, and that lets me look around to take stock of my surroundings. Our surroundings.
他不再束缚我后，我试图坐起来；这比预想的要困难。或许是离开太久的后果。我皱着眉头，勉强撑起身子坐正，这才得以环顾四周，审视我们的环境。

We're on an unfamiliar beach. White sand, red water. No... the scent tells me it's LCL, even from here, but it's frothing and playing like sea water. Maybe it's a little of both. It's night, too, and the stars seem too bright for the moment it takes me to realize that this is because there are no city lights obscuring them. No lights at all, in fact, except those hovering above. Oddly-familiar statues lean in slovenly disarray up from the sea, and farther out gapes a megalithic and godlike half-Rei. Behind us, over the slope of the beach, I can spot skeletal power poles and tilted street signs. This place, I decide, feels like it should ring a bell, but I don't know this part of the city very well.
我们身处一个陌生的海滩。白沙，红水。不...那气息告诉我这是 LCL，即便从这里也能感受到，但它翻腾嬉戏，宛如海水。或许两者兼而有之。此刻正值夜晚，星星显得异常明亮，我过了一会儿才意识到这是因为没有城市灯光遮挡它们。实际上，除了悬浮在上方的光，没有任何光源。熟悉的雕像以懒散的杂乱姿态从海中倾斜而出，更远处，半身像的巨大且神性的半身像张着口。在我们身后，越过海滩的斜坡，我能看到骨架般的电线杆和倾斜的路标。这个地方，我总觉得应该有所耳闻，但我对这座城市的这一部分并不熟悉。

I swallow, and it hurts. Making a face, I rub my neck gingerly, but I don't think anything's broken there, or out of place. It's strange, but my throat actually hurts more than the parts of me covered in bandages. The warm weight against my left eye is a little stifling, but I ignore it. The sensation will go away on its own.
我咽了咽口水，感觉疼痛。皱着眉头，我小心翼翼地揉了揉脖子，但似乎那里并没有受伤或错位。奇怪的是，我的喉咙实际上比缠着绷带的部位还要痛。左眼上的温热重量有些令人窒息，但我选择忽略它。这种感觉会自行消失。

The cyclical murmur of blood waves keeps time to Shinji's choked gasping. Stars stare coldly down on us, along with the moon, a circle split in two by a curious arc of red in the sky. My memory stirs at that, but whatever it means, it's gone before I can identify it.
血液波浪的循环低语与真嗣哽咽的喘息同步。星星冷冷地俯视着我们，月亮亦然，天空中一道奇异的红弧将它一分为二。这景象触动了我的记忆，但无论它意味着什么，都在我辨认出来之前消逝了。

Gradually Shinji forces his tears under control; now all I can hear from him is a sort of heavy breathing and the occasional sniffle. Without turning my head in his direction I hug knees to my chest and stare out over the dark water.
渐渐地，真嗣控制住了泪水；现在我能听到的，只是他沉重的呼吸和偶尔的抽泣声。我没有转头看向他，而是将膝盖抱在胸前，凝视着黑暗的水面。

I'm here. Alive. On solid ground. I've never really appreciated that before.
我在这里。活着。脚踏实地。我以前从未真正珍惜过这一点。

Time crawls past; I'm not sure how much. An hour, maybe, in silence broken only by the waves.
时间缓缓流逝；我不确定过了多久。或许是一个小时，寂静中只有波浪声偶尔打破沉默。

What even happened? It's a question that probably should have struck me right away, but the fog of slumber has only slowly disappeared from my mind. That was... Third Impact, clearly. I didn't really know it was supposed to be like that, dreamlike and shared. More like a nightmare than a dream, really, but like either, it's already fading from memory. Some parts stick out, though, parts I won't forget. I remember Shinji. There was actually a lot of Shinji, but what stands out clearly is the argument. Misato's kitchen, but different. He's so pathetic, literally begging for help, like he thinks I'll be some mindless pair of arms to comfort him. Like I'll put everything on hold to satisfy some circle-jerk sympathy fantasy of his. After everything he did to me? Over me? Not likely.
到底发生了什么？这个问题本该立刻浮现在我脑海，但睡意的迷雾只是缓缓从我心中消散。那是……第三次冲击，显然。我并不真正知道它应该是那样的，如梦似幻且共享。更像是噩梦而非美梦，真的，但无论是哪种，它已从记忆中逐渐淡去。不过，有些部分却挥之不去，那些我无法忘记的部分。我记得真嗣。关于他的记忆其实很多，但清晰浮现的是那场争吵。在美里家的厨房，但又有所不同。他如此可怜，几乎是在哀求帮助，仿佛认为我会成为一双无意识的臂膀去安慰他。好像我会为了满足他那自怜自艾的同情幻想而搁置一切。他对我所做的一切，凌驾于我之上？绝无可能。

I remember him strangling me. The silence beforehand, his head hanging, too weak to look me in the eye. The odd grinning snarl on his face in the split second before he did it. He's stronger than I would have thought, or at least he was in that place. It didn't take long for darkness to take over.
我记得他掐住我的脖子。在那之前的一片寂静，他垂着头，虚弱到不敢直视我的眼睛。在他动手前那一瞬间，脸上怪异的狞笑。他的力气比我预想的要大，至少在那个地方是如此。黑暗很快便吞噬了一切。

I remember choosing not to fight him. It was a sick gesture, letting him kill me just so that I could be free of pain, and maybe do the same for him. I don't think it helped, though.
我记得选择不去与他抗争。那是一种病态的举动，任由他杀死我，只为摆脱痛苦，或许也能为他带来解脱。但我不认为这有什么帮助。

I remember touching his face. I loathe him, but that was honest.
我记得触摸过他的脸。我憎恨他，但那一刻是真切的。

It's... quiet here. There's the wash of waves, but nothing else. No traffic, no television in another room. No animals, even. I wonder if any are even left.
这里...很安静。只有海浪的拍打声，别无其他。没有车流，没有隔壁房间的电视声。甚至连动物的声响也没有。我在想，是否还有生物存留。

Resting my chin on my knees, I stare vaguely off at Rei's monumental head, sliced in half. It's a ludicrous thing to see, but I feel curiously little at the sight. I barely remember anything of her from Instrumentality.
我下巴搁在膝盖上，茫然地凝视着被劈成两半的绫波丽巨大头像。这景象荒诞不经，但我对此却出奇地无动于衷。关于她在人类补完计划中的记忆，我几乎一片空白。

Whatever. "Shinji, I'm thirsty."
随便吧。"真嗣，我渴了。"

I blink at Asuka, barely registering her words as thoughts of a unified blob of humanity fade into mist. She's just staring off over the water, not looking at me at all. A few strands of red hair dance fitfully away from her shoulders in the faint sea-breeze.
我眨了眨眼，对明日香的话几乎没听进去，脑海中人类融合成一团的思绪渐渐消散如雾。她只是凝视着水面，根本没有看我。几缕红发在微弱的海风中不安分地从她肩上飘起。

As the silence deepens, she turns her head, and a slight frown creases her features. Not an angry frown. "I'm thirsty," she repeats quietly, blue eyes levelly meeting my own.
随着沉默加深，她转过头来，眉头微蹙。不是生气的皱眉。"我渴了，"她再次轻声重复，蓝眼睛平静地与我对视。

Oh. "I... I don't have any water," I admit, grimacing. "I haven't really looked around much." In fact I probably haven't been more than ten or fifteen meters from where we sit. Even Misato's memorial I made out of driftwood washed up on the beach.
哦。"我...我没有水，"我承认道，皱起了眉头。"我其实没怎么四处看过。"事实上，我可能离我们坐的地方不超过十到十五米。就连我用海滩上冲上来的浮木为美里做的纪念碑也是如此。

A wave froths playfully against the sand as she watches me. "How long have you been here?"
海浪轻快地拍打着沙滩，她正注视着我。"你在这里多久了？"

I shake my head, glancing out over the moonlit water. "Not long. Less than a day before you woke up, and then... an hour since? Hour and a half?" Eyeing her again, I don a questioning expression, wondering at the length of our solitude.
我摇摇头，望向月光下的海面。"不久。在你醒来之前不到一天，然后...一个小时？一个半小时？" 我再次看向她，脸上带着询问的表情，思索着我们独处的时长。

Rather than answer, she frowns a little more deeply, apparently waiting for more. Then she lifts a cool eyebrow. "Water?"
她没有回答，而是皱眉更深了些，似乎在等待更多的话语。随后，她微微挑起冷淡的眉毛，"水？"

"I said I..." Sighing, I shake my head, then climb to my feet. "Can you stand?"
我说我..." 我叹了口气，摇摇头，然后站起身来。"你能站起来吗？

A dark look crosses her face as she stares down at herself. "I don't think so," she answers, her voice low.
她低头凝视着自己，脸上掠过一丝阴郁。“我不这么认为，”她低声回答。

I hesitate at this. It's unlike her to admit inability, especially without trying first. I suppose I've changed in the last day, though; why not her too? And why water? I mean, sure, I see the obvious need for basic necessities, but if I were her, I'd sure as hell be confused about what just happened. About the city, the world, all the people in it.
对此我犹豫了。她通常不会承认自己不行，尤其是在未尝试之前。我想，经过昨天，我变了；她为什么不能变呢？还有，为什么是水？当然，我明白基本需求的重要性，但如果我是她，我肯定会对自己刚刚经历的一切感到困惑。关于这座城市，这个世界，以及其中的所有人。

Too proud to ask, I suppose. Typical Asuka.
我想，她太骄傲了，不愿开口求助。典型的明日香。

As the silence stretches, I shift my feet in the sand. "Aren't you going to try?"
沉默持续着，我在沙地上挪动脚步。“你不打算试试吗？”

She spares me a withering look, then sighs, planting hands on the ground and pushing. Tendons stand out in her trembling arms and shoulders, and her lips peel back from her teeth, but shortly she falls back, letting her head plop back into the sand. Naked pain on her face is shortly replaced with a scowl. "I... can't," she mutters, turning her face away.
她朝我投来一个蔑视的眼神，随后叹了口气，双手撑地试图起身。颤抖的手臂和肩膀上青筋暴起，嘴唇紧抿露出牙齿，但很快她又跌坐回去，头无力地埋进沙中。脸上的痛苦神色转瞬即逝，取而代之的是一脸怒容。“我……做不到，”她低语着，别过脸去。

After a moment I let drop the hand I was holding out for her. She'd still rather fail than let anyone help her. Typical Asuka.
片刻后，我放下了原本伸向她的手。她宁愿失败也不愿接受任何人的帮助。典型的明日香。

When I say nothing, she rolls her head back to stare up at me, blue eyes strangely cautious. "Can you get some for me?"
见我默不作声，她转过头来，用那双异常谨慎的蓝眼睛仰望着我，“你能帮我拿点吗？”

"Some water?" I clarify. She nods once. I open my mouth again to answer in the affirmative, but abruptly it occurs to me how similar this situation is to when she was in the hospital, sedated. Her lying there, helpless, while I stand over her and make a choice. Only this time it's her who needs something from me, rather than the other way around. I'm not the weak one anymore. Not the strong one, either, maybe, but... not weak.
“水吗？”我确认道。她点了点头。我张口正要肯定地回答，却突然意识到这一幕与她在医院被麻醉时的情景何其相似。她无助地躺在那里，而我站在一旁做出选择。只是这次，是她需要我，而非我依赖她。我不再是弱者。或许也称不上强者，但……绝非弱者。

Her eyes harden as though the same thought has occurred to her. She says nothing, though.
她的眼神变得冷硬，仿佛也想到了同一件事。但她什么也没说。

"Fine," I sigh. "Anything else?"
好吧，" 我叹了口气。"还有别的吗？

"Get some food, too. Unless you'd rather head out a second time when we get hungry."
也买点吃的吧。除非你想在我们饿的时候再出去一趟。

I feel a smile tug at my lips, but it's not one of happiness. She just came back from death, and has spoken to me only to insult me and send me on errands. Typical Asuka. "No problem," I assure her. "Don't go anywhere, though." Only after the words leave my mouth do I realize how stupid they sound, and I grimace.
我感到嘴角微微上扬，但这并非出于喜悦。她刚从死亡边缘归来，与我交谈只是为了嘲讽我并差遣我做事。典型的明日香。"没问题，" 我向她保证。"不过，别乱跑。" 话一出口，我才意识到这话有多愚蠢，不由得皱了皱眉。

"Bite me." Her voice is bored, not angry.
"咬我啊。"她的声音里透着无聊，而非愤怒。

Shaking my head, I turn and make my way up the gentle slope of the beach, feeling the sand give under every quiet step. Gradually the city resolves into view past the peak of the incline, and I stand atop it for a moment, staring around.
我摇了摇头，转身沿着海滩的缓坡向上走去，每一步都感受到沙子在脚下悄然让开。渐渐地，城市随着坡顶的临近映入眼帘，我站在坡顶片刻，环顾四周。

Tokyo-3 is... somehow more immense than I remember. An endless warren of crouching shadows and half-toppled infrastructure glowing silently in the silver moonlight. Even after accounting for the massive chunk of the city missing after the departure of the Black Moon, it's still enormous, an easy place to get lost in with no vehicle and no Eva to carry me around.
第三新东京市……不知怎的，比记忆中更为宏大。无尽的阴影蜷缩着，半倒塌的基础设施在银色月光下静静发光。即便考虑到黑月离去后城市缺失的那一大块，它依旧庞大，没有车辆和 Eva 的搭载，很容易迷失其中。

It's a ghost town. 这里宛如一座鬼城。

Lips tight, I glance back behind me, but Asuka is still just lying on the beach. She's propped herself up on her elbows now, though, for all the world like someone enjoying a tropical vacation somewhere.
我紧抿着嘴唇，回头望去，但明日香依旧躺在沙滩上。她现在用手肘撑起身体，仿佛在某个热带度假胜地享受假期一般。

After a moment I shift my gaze back to the abandoned city and try not to slump where I stand. With no flashlight or anything, this should be... interesting, but Asuka doesn't look good, not at all. I'm sure she needs water and whatever else she can think of, and I owe it to her to get what she needs.
片刻后，我将目光转回那座废弃的城市，努力不让自己显得颓然。没有手电筒或其他工具，这应该会……很有趣，但明日香看起来状态不佳，一点也不好。我确信她需要水和任何她能想到的东西，我欠她这份情，得为她弄到所需之物。

Taking a deep breath, I step over a low wall and onto the cracked pavement beyond. With steeled shoulders and a determined scowl, I forge off into the moon-painted shadows to scavenge what I can.
深吸一口气，我跨过一道矮墙，踏上了龟裂的路面。肩背挺直，面带决绝的怒容，我毅然闯入月光下的阴影中，搜寻所能找到的一切。

Author's note part two: Sorry for the fragmented beginning, but it had to be done. I expect it'll alternate points of view from now on, with each chapter belonging to a single character. Look for Asuka's in chapter two.
作者第二条注记：抱歉开头有些零碎，但这是必要的。预计从现在开始会交替视角，每章属于一个角色。请期待第二章中明日香的视角。

### Chapter 02 Grave Non Troppo
恰如其分地庄重

So many stars. Even with the moon out, they're just so... bright. I've never really seen anything like it before, except maybe on Over the Rainbow, but I had other things to worry about then, like Kaji and Shinji and fighting the Sixth Angel. Here, though, there's nothing much to do but stare at the sky.
星星真多。即便月亮高挂，它们依旧如此... 明亮。我以前从未见过这样的景象，或许在《彩虹之上》见过，但那时我还有其他烦心事，比如卡吉和真嗣，还有与第六使徒的战斗。而在这里，除了凝望星空，别无他事。

No lights out, either. The wash of urban light pollution has made stargazing a pretty dull hobby for most of my life; Tokyo-3 is actually the least-populous city I've lived in. Or at least it was for most of the time I was here. It definitely is now.
也没有灯光熄灭。城市光污染的泛滥让观星在我大部分人生中变得相当乏味；第三新东京市实际上是我居住过人口最少的城市。至少在我大部分时间住在这里时是这样。现在肯定也是如此。

I wonder... I wonder if anyone else is even in the city. Or in the world.
我在想... 是否还有其他人在这座城市。或者在这个世界上。

Nothing but silence now, silence and the soothing wash of the waves. As pretty as the sky is, though, I can't help but find my eyes drawn back to the ribbon of crimson arcing smoothly through the night sky, intersecting the moon. I've been through college, and I know a lot of things, and one of them is that the Earth is... not supposed to have a ring. It's the same color as the LCL sea, too.
现在只剩下寂静，以及海浪轻柔的拍打声。尽管星空美丽，我的目光却不由自主地被夜空中那道平滑划过的猩红弧线吸引，它与月亮交错。我上过大学，知道很多事情，其中之一就是地球... 不应该有环。它的颜色也与 LCL 之海相同。

I frown. Another wave whispers against the smooth sand.
我皱起眉头。又一阵波浪轻声拂过平滑的沙滩。

Whatever. The stars are pretty. The rhythm of the lapping sea is relaxing as well, but only if I can avoid looking at it. All that leaves me is... the sky.
算了，星星很美。海浪拍打的节奏也挺让人放松的，只要我不去看它。留给我的，只剩下...天空。

I wonder where Shinji is. Maybe I shouldn't have sent him off alone; I'm thirsty, but not desiccated or anything. Dork's probably gone and broken a leg in the dark or something.
不知道真嗣现在在哪儿。或许我不该让他一个人去的；我有点渴，但还没到干涸的地步。那傻瓜可能在黑暗中摔断腿了什么的。

Another wave. Breeze stirs my hair as I lie in the sand.
又是一阵波浪。微风轻拂着躺在沙地上的我的发丝。

It's so... quiet here. That's another thing I keep coming back to. So... not tranquil, exactly, but subdued. It's like the pressure differential between the static in my head and the silence outside allows my worries to push out into the environment and just dissipate somewhere. I don't think I even realized I was walking around with a permanent knot in my belly until I noticed a few minutes ago that it was gone.
这里真是...太安静了。这也是我不断回想起的一点。并非宁静，确切地说，是沉静。仿佛我脑海中的杂音与外界的寂静之间的压力差，让我的忧虑得以推出，消散于无形。直到几分钟前，我才意识到，那一直紧绷在腹部的结已经消失了，而我甚至未曾察觉自己一直带着它四处走动。

I'm not tense. Not happy, but not tense either. This is something new. I've died and come back, and the Angels are gone, so the problems I face now are pretty mild in comparison. I mean, that was the goal, right? My goal, at least. No more Angels.
我不紧张。也不快乐，但也不紧张。这是一种新的感受。我曾死去又复活，天使们已离去，现在面对的问题相比之下显得微不足道。我的目标，至少是如此。不再有天使。

It seems like I should be smiling.
似乎我应该微笑。

Without really thinking about it I reach a hand up and touch my face, not for the first time. It feels like it should, but the square of gauze over my left eye is a new addition. I remember all too well getting stabbed there, the sickening combination of shocking pain and numbness, followed by an eerie chill. The bandage seems awfully small, if it's intended to cover an injury like that. But then, it doesn't really hurt. Neither does my right arm, and I definitely remember feeling that split right down the middle.
我下意识地伸手摸了摸脸，这已经不是第一次了。感觉和往常一样，只是左眼上多了一块纱布。我清晰地记得那里被刺伤的情景，那种突如其来的剧痛与麻木交织，随后是一阵诡异的寒意。这绷带似乎太小了，如果真是为了遮盖那样的伤口。但奇怪的是，它并不疼。我的右臂也是，尽管我清楚记得那道裂痕带来的痛楚。

A rumble reaches my ears, and belatedly I realize I'm grinding my teeth. Exhaling heavily, I still my jaw and reach my arms out to either side. The sand is damp and cool despite the warmth of the night air, and fine grains stick to my skin as I absently burrow hands into the ground.
一阵低沉的响声传入耳中，我这才意识到自己在咬牙切齿。我重重地呼出一口气，放松下颚，双臂向两侧伸展。尽管夜风温暖，沙子却带着湿气和凉意，细小的沙粒随着我漫不经心地用手挖掘而粘附在皮肤上。

Where the hell is he? How long does it really take to find the most common substance on the surface of the planet? I hope he's just turning clever, getting a bunch of useful stuff while he happens to be out now.
他到底在哪儿？找到地球表面最常见的物质需要多久？我希望他只是变得机智了，趁现在出去顺便收集一些有用的东西。

Blood waves rustle on sand. I close my eyes.
血色的波浪在沙滩上轻响。我闭上了眼睛。

Some time later, maybe an hour after he left, I hear soft footsteps on the slope behind me. Without opening my eyes I listen more carefully, evaluating the slow but steady rhythm they create, something suited to a tired or depressed individual.
过了一会儿，大概是他离开后一个小时左右，我听到身后斜坡上传来轻柔的脚步声。我没有睁眼，而是更加仔细地聆听，评估着那缓慢而稳定的节奏，这节奏适合一个疲惫或沮丧的人。

Yeah, that's him. In my head I can almost see him making his reluctant way over here, probably not sure whether I'm going to be nice or snap at him.
嗯，是他。在我的脑海中，我几乎能看见他不太情愿地朝这边走来，可能不确定我是会友好相待还是会对他发火。

When he's close, I hold an open hand out, and shortly something plastic sloshes into it. "Thanks." The word comes out as more of a mutter than an expression of gratitude.
当他靠近时，我伸出一只摊开的手，很快有什么塑料的东西倒进了我的手里。“谢谢。”这个词说出来更像是一声咕哝，而非感激的表达。

"Don't mention it." Shinji plops down onto the sand next to me, and I can hear plastic wrappers crinkle as he shifts things around in his hands. "I got other stuff too. Some food. I found a... what used to be a convenience store, and got some energy bars and stuff. Found a flashlight too, but the batteries must have been dead."
“不用谢。”真嗣在我旁边的沙滩上坐下，我能听到塑料包装纸随着他在手中调整东西而发出的沙沙声。“我还带了其他东西。一些食物。我发现了一个……曾经是便利店的地方，拿了一些能量棒之类的东西。还找到了一个手电筒，但电池肯定是没电了。”

As he's speaking I sit upright again and twist the cap off the bottle of water he got for me. With a mouth half-full of clear liquid, I pause, frowning; it's lukewarm, not chilled. Shifting my expression to Shinji, I nod a question at him while swallowing. "You got this from a store?"
他正说着，我又坐直了身子，拧开他给我拿的那瓶水的盖子。嘴里含着半口水，我皱起眉头停了下来；水是温的，并非冰镇。我调整表情看向真嗣，一边咽下水一边向他点头示意询问：“这是你从店里拿的？”

"Yeah." Cobalt eyes shift to meet mine, then slide away again. "I didn't... pay for it, obviously."
嗯。" 那双钴蓝色的眼睛转向我，随即又移开。"我当然...没付钱。

I suppress my annoyance at this unnecessary clarification. "Was it in a refrigerator or something?"
我压下对这个不必要澄清的恼火。"是从冰箱里拿的吗？"

He nods, cracking open his own bottle. There are four more sitting next to him, as well as a handful of bar-shaped foil packages glittering in the moonlight. "Yeah. There's lots of stuff there, if you want more."
他点点头，打开了自己的水瓶。他旁边还放着四瓶水，以及一把在月光下闪闪发光的条状铝箔包装物。"对。那里有很多东西，如果你还想要的话。"

I feel my frown deepening as I regard the mostly-full plastic bottle in my hands. "Shinji, it's not cold at all."
我看着手中几乎满的塑料瓶，眉头越皱越深。“真嗣，这水一点也不凉。”

Narrow shoulders roll irritably. "What do you want me to do? There's no electricity."
他瘦削的肩膀不耐烦地耸了耸。“那你想让我怎么办？这里没电。”

"No, it's..." Pausing, I spare him a disgusted look. "No, idiot, those cases are insulated. If the power just went off, they'd still be cold. Or at least cool."
“不，不是那个意思……”我停顿了一下，厌恶地瞥了他一眼。“不，笨蛋，那些冷藏箱是隔热的。如果只是停电，里面的东西应该还是冷的，或者至少是凉的。”

He scowls back at me, but as my meaning sinks in, his face grows more thoughtful, almost worried. "It was daylight when we... left," he recalls softly, glancing at the dark sky above. "And now it's night."
他回瞪着我，但随着我的话意渐渐明了，他的表情变得沉思起来，甚至有些忧虑。“我们离开的时候还是白天，”他轻声回忆道，抬头望向漆黑的天空。“而现在已经是夜晚了。”

"About midnight," I guess, eyeing the fullish moon almost directly overhead; it'll be opposite the sun at this point. "We were gone more than a few hours, though. A couple of days, at least." Unless that particular store just had crappy beverage cases.
"大概是午夜时分，"我猜测着，抬头望向几乎正上方的满月；此时它应该正对着太阳。"我们离开肯定不止几个小时，至少得有几天吧。"除非那家店的饮料冷藏柜特别差劲。

"I don't know," he admits, visibly troubled. "I suppose we could have been gone for a year for all I know. A thousand years."
我不清楚，"他承认道，显得心事重重。"我猜我们可能已经离开了一年，甚至一千年，谁知道呢。

"The city would barely be here after a thousand years," I point out acidly. "So it's probably only..." I pause, wondering why I even care. "Look, just give me one of those bars. I'm hungry."
一千年后，这座城市恐怕都不复存在了，"我尖刻地指出。"所以，很可能只是……"我顿了顿，不明白自己为何要在意。"算了，给我来块那种能量棒吧，我饿了。

He shrugs, retrieving the gaudy packages from where they lay. "What do you want? Apple? Tri-Berry? I think there's a..."
他耸了耸肩，从地上捡起那些花哨的包装。"你要哪种？苹果味？三莓味？我记得还有个……"

Shinji falls silent as I swipe a bar at random from his hands, then tug apart the wrapper. After the first bite, though, I freeze, then resume chewing more slowly. "The hell is this?" I wonder, finding the wrapper again to inspect it by moonlight. "Prune? Seriously? You got a prune-flavored energy bar?"
真嗣沉默了，我随手从他手里夺过一根能量棒，撕开包装。第一口咬下后，我愣住了，随后慢慢咀嚼起来。“这是什么鬼？”我疑惑着，借着月光再次查看包装。“梅子味？认真的吗？你居然拿了梅子味的能量棒？”

"I just grabbed one of everything there," he explains mildly. "Don't blame me. Maybe you should have waited and listened before taking one."
“我只是把那儿的东西每样拿了一个，”他平静地解释道，“别怪我。或许你该等等，听完再拿。”

I feel my eyes widen at this, too surprised to be angry. For a moment. "Well, maybe if you hadn't taken forever, I wouldn't have been so hungry."
我瞪大了眼睛，一时惊讶得忘了生气。但只持续了一会儿。“哼，要是你没磨蹭那么久，我也不至于饿成这样。”

"It's dark out, Asuka." His voice is uncharacteristically calm. Not flat or dead, just calm. "The streets are full of glass and random debris and stuff. Inside buildings it's even darker; I had to find all of this this mostly by touch."
“外面很黑，明日香。”他的声音出奇地平静，不是冷漠或死寂，只是平静。“街道上满是碎玻璃和各种杂物。建筑物里更是漆黑一片；我几乎全靠摸索才找到这些东西。”

"Whatever." As Shinji begins to eat as well, I spare him a sidelong glance against my better judgement, but he seems totally collected. That seems odd; he should be stammering an apology or yelling back at me, or failing both of those, simply staring vacantly at the ground.
"随便吧。" 当真嗣也开始吃东西时，我违背自己的判断，忍不住侧目瞥了他一眼，但他看起来异常镇定。这很奇怪；他本该结结巴巴地道歉，或者对我大喊大叫，再不济，也该只是呆呆地盯着地面。

In silence we eat, and shortly I'm licking sticky glaze from my fingers. "Hey," I begin, nodding up at the sky. "What's that red thing?"
我们默默地吃着，不久我便舔起了手指上的黏腻糖霜。"喂，" 我开口道，抬头望向天空。"那红色的东西是什么？"

He takes another swallow of water from his bottle, following my gaze. Then he makes a sad face. "Souls," he answers quietly. "Human souls. They... uh, came spraying out of Rei's neck during Instrumentality."
他再次从水瓶中喝了一口水，顺着我的目光望去。然后他露出了悲伤的表情。"灵魂，" 他轻声回答。"人类的灵魂。它们...呃，在融合过程中从绫波的脖子里喷涌而出。"

I nod silently. It seems like this should shock or horrify me, but now that just kind of seems... par for the course. "They're all up there, huh?" I wonder softly. "Do you suppose anyone is here besides us, or are they all in orbit now?"
我默默地点了点头。这本该让我震惊或恐惧，但现在看来，这似乎...不过是常态。"它们都在上面吗？" 我轻声问道。"你觉得除了我们，还有其他人在这里吗，还是说他们都已经在轨道上了？"

Shinji doesn't answer, and when I glance at him, he's giving me some weird look, like he's embarrassed at something stupid I've said. "Don't look at me like that," I snap. "It seems empty here, but we haven't really explored or anything. There could be tons of people around, just not here. Tokyo-3 is--"
真嗣没有回答，当我瞥向他时，他正用一种奇怪的眼神看着我，好像我刚说了什么蠢话让他尴尬似的。"别那样看着我，"我厉声道。"这里看起来空荡荡的，但我们还没真正探索过。可能到处都是人，只是不在这儿。东京-3 是——"

"The one place people are almost guaranteed to come back to," he interrupts smoothly. "But you can see how quiet it is here. There's no one around, Asuka. Nobody in the world. Just you and me." His eyes meet mine significantly, without humor.
"人们几乎肯定会回来的地方，"他流畅地打断我。"但你看看这里有多安静。周围一个人也没有，明日香。世界上没有别人。只有你和我。"他的目光意味深长地与我对视，毫无笑意。

I peel my lips back to chew him out for the lame Adam and Eve comparison, but with effort I keep my mouth shut. It's... so easy to fall into old patterns, isn't it? I need to try harder now. I can complain all I want about everything that's happened, but one thing it's given me is a chance to start things fresh. I didn't need Third Impact to tell me I was a colossal failure before.
我本想咧嘴反驳他那老套的亚当夏娃比喻，但还是努力忍住了。...陷入旧模式太容易了，不是吗？我现在得更努力才行。我可以尽情抱怨发生的一切，但有一点它给了我重新开始的机会。我不需要第三次冲击来告诉我，我之前是个彻底的失败者。

Shinji keeps his silence as he eats, perhaps wisely, and I take the opportunity to regain my composure. For some reason I end up gazing off at the half-likeness of Rei's face out in the water. She's going to be there for some time, I suppose. I can almost see idiots in a future generation hauling it out of the water to place in a monument like some damn holy relic.
真嗣默默地吃着东西，或许是明智之举，我趁机恢复镇定。不知为何，我的目光最终落在了水中那半似绫波的面容上。我想，她还会在那里待上一段时间。我几乎能预见到，未来某个时代的蠢货们会将它从水中拖出，当作某种该死的圣物立碑纪念。

"So," sighs my companion after a long moment. "What do you suppose we do now?"
“那么，”我的同伴长叹一声后说道，“你觉得我们现在该怎么办？”

"Well," I shrug, "there's lots of stuff to do. We could use more food than just those bars, and I might need crutches for a little while, and we could both use new clothes." I'm still wearing my plugsuit, for one thing, and Shinji's school uniform has probably been ruined by the drying LCL. "Also, it would be a good idea to explore. We're scavengers now, for the time being -- we'll call this Phase One -- so until we can get all of our necessities, and maybe a vehicle--"
“嗯，”我耸耸肩，“要做的事情多着呢。我们需要的不仅仅是那些能量棒，我可能暂时需要拐杖，而且我们俩都需要换身衣服。”我身上还穿着插入栓服，而真嗣的校服大概已经被干掉的 LCL 毁了。“此外，探索一番也是个好主意。眼下我们成了拾荒者——姑且称之为第一阶段——所以在我们能满足所有必需品，甚至可能找到一辆交通工具之前——”

"No," he interjects, lifting a stalling hand. "I mean in the long run. I agree it won't take us long to get all the stuff we need to survive, so after that... what is there to do? There are no people now. No... no structure, no goals. All we can shoot for is to survive for a long time. To die old instead of young."
不，"他插话道，举起一只手示意暂停。"我是说长远来看。我同意我们不会花太长时间就能收集到生存所需的一切，但之后呢...还有什么可做的？现在没有其他人了。没有...没有结构，没有目标。我们唯一能追求的就是长时间生存下去。为了老死而不是年轻就死去。

Die? "You've got to be kidding me," I growl, rubbing my face with one hand. "Shinji, there have to be more people. There are two of us just on this beach, and the rest of the world is much larger. I really doubt it's all empty."
死？"你一定是在开玩笑，"我低吼着，用一只手揉着脸。"真嗣，肯定还有其他人。光是这片海滩上就有我们两个，而世界要大得多。我真的怀疑它已经空无一人了。"

He starts shaking his head slowly while I'm still talking. "Think about it, Asuka. For one thing, we're not just two random people who appeared on a beach; we were both... kind of... closely involved with Third Impact. Probably the two most closely-involved of those that'll ever make it back, and this beach is pretty close to where it all happened. And in any case," he adds when I open my mouth, "like you said, it's probably been days since it all happened. We haven't seen any other people yet, or even signs of any other people. Plus, if anyone else were here, I just... think that... I would know."
我还在说话时，他已经开始缓缓摇头。"想想吧，明日香。首先，我们不是两个偶然出现在海滩上的普通人；我们都...算是...与第三次冲击密切相关。可能是最密切相关的幸存者，而这片海滩离事发地相当近。再说了，"我刚要开口，他补充道，"就像你说的，这一切可能已经过去好几天了。我们还没见到其他人，甚至没有其他人的任何迹象。而且，如果还有别人在这里，我...我觉得...我会知道的。"

I scowl at the side of his head, fighting the urge to smack it. "You're an idiot," I point out helpfully, "and you wouldn't just know. But also, it's way too early to say anything like that. Let's look around and see who else might be here."
我皱眉盯着他的侧脸，强忍着拍上去的冲动。“你真是个傻瓜，”我好心指出，“而且你也不会知道。再说，现在说这种话还为时尚早。我们四处看看，说不定还有其他人在这里。”

"We can if you want to," he sighs irritatingly, "but I don't think we'll find anyone. I mean, look around you. The city is just... obviously empty."
“如果你想的话，我们可以去找，”他不耐烦地叹了口气，“但我觉得我们找不到任何人。我的意思是，看看四周。这座城市明显空无一人。”

"Well, even if you're right," I decide, "we're here, right? So eventually other people might make it back." They have to. Going through all of that crap just to live like hunter-gatherers again... that's a decision Shinji would come to regret.
“好吧，就算你是对的，”我决定道，“我们既然来了，对吧？所以迟早会有其他人回来的。”他们必须回来。经历了那么多破事，最后却只能像原始人一样生活……那将是真嗣会后悔的决定。

He doesn't answer for a moment, and a few meters away another wave hisses into the beach. The lines of foam along the breaker almost look like words before they writhe and dissipate.
他一时没有回答，几米开外，又一波海浪沙沙地冲上沙滩。泡沫沿着浪花形成的线条，在扭曲消散前，几乎像是文字。

"Rei said... people could return," explains Shinji eventually; his voice is as distant as it is quiet. "She said people who were... I think strong-willed, and wanted to come back here, could. But there's just us, now. We're the only two people in the world. And, really, who'd want to come back to this, anyway? It's all just blood and shambles."
绫波说...人们可以回来," 真嗣最终解释道，他的声音既遥远又平静。"她说那些...我想是意志坚强，并且想要回到这里的人，可以。但现在只有我们，我们是世界上仅剩的两个人。而且，说真的，谁会想回到这样的地方呢？这里只有血迹和废墟。

I shoot him another icy look, but the jerk isn't even paying attention to me. "So," I conclude, keeping my voice menacingly soft, "what you're saying is that there's nobody here right now, so clearly there won't ever be any more people, so we shouldn't even bother to make plans for the future. Do you realize what an utterly ass-backwards idea that is?" No wonder the world looks like this, if he was the one in charge of ending it or saving it.
我又向他投去一个冰冷的目光，但这混蛋甚至都没在注意我。"所以，"我总结道，声音故意压得阴森森的，"你的意思是现在这里没人，显然以后也不会再有人了，所以我们根本不应该费心规划未来。你意识到这想法有多么荒谬吗？"难怪世界会变成这样，如果他是负责终结或拯救世界的人。

Blank blue eyes slide to meet mine, and for a moment he just blinks. Then he quirks a little smile, returning to stare out over the bay. He doesn't say anything, though.
空洞的蓝眼睛转向我，有那么一刻他只是眨了眨眼。然后他微微一笑，又转头望向海湾。不过，他什么也没说。

The hell? Jerk's too good to answer me? Scowling, I plant hands against the sand and push. My arms and legs shake somewhat but this time I'm able to stand.
搞什么？这混蛋不屑于回答我？我皱着眉头，双手撑在沙地上用力一推。我的手臂和腿有些颤抖，但这次我成功站了起来。

Shinji scrambles to his feet beside me, hovering as though he's sure I'm going to fall at any time. I shoot him a warning glance, then frown at the water. It feels good to put weight on my legs. "Hey."
真嗣在我旁边急忙站起身，仿佛随时准备扶住我似的。我朝他投去警告的一瞥，然后皱眉看向水面。能用腿支撑身体的感觉真好。“喂。”

"What?" “什么？”

"Get me some crutches." Sea breeze ruffles my hair as I speak, brings a measure of respite from the ever-present humidity. "I don't care what you find, just as long as it'll hold my weight."
“给我找副拐杖来。”说话间，海风拂乱了我的发丝，带来一丝从无处不在的湿气中解脱的慰藉。“我不管你找到什么，只要能承受我的重量就行。”

"O-Okay." His voice is breathy, solicitous. "Right. I'll be right back."
“好-好的。”他的声音有些喘息，充满关切。“马上。我这就回来。”

I ignore him as he hurries off, instead feeling another scowl form on my face as I regard the distant remains of Wondergirl. I don't have a clue how she came to be like that, but I'm not exactly sad that she's gone.
我无视他匆忙离去的身影，反而感到脸上又浮现出一丝怒意，目光投向远方残破的奇迹少女。我完全不知道她为何会变成那样，但我并不为她消失而感到悲伤。

After long moments of stillness my legs start to feel tired. With a sigh I step forward, then find myself stumbling and falling to the sand. Flinging arms forward, I manage to catch myself just short of an undignified face-plant. A quick glance behind me shows me that Shinji's already gone, that he didn't see. Good.
长时间的静止后，我的双腿开始感到疲惫。叹了口气，我迈步前行，却突然踉跄跌倒在沙地上。急忙伸出双臂，我勉强避免了尴尬的面部着地。回头一瞥，发现真嗣已经离开，没有目睹这一幕。还好。

Exhaling tightly, I push myself up and shift around, letting the sea wash against my plugsuited feet and calves. This close, it smells like salt and blood. Like me.
紧绷地呼出一口气，我撑起身体，转身让海水冲刷着我的插入栓服覆盖的脚和小腿。近在咫尺，海风带着咸腥与血腥的味道，就像我一样。

I barely remember a time before I knew about LCL, and now I feel like it's as much a part of me as the stuff it looks and smells like. It's part and parcel of my identity as a pilot... but I still can't say I like it. You'd have to be a freak to enjoy floating in a tube of blood for hours at a time.
我几乎记不清在了解 LCL 之前的日子了，现在它对我来说，就如同它所呈现和散发的气息一样，成了我的一部分。作为驾驶员的身份，它不可或缺...但我仍旧无法说喜欢它。除非是怪胎，否则谁会享受在血色液体中漂浮数小时呢。

Waves foam around my legs. I keep thinking I should be smiling.
波浪在我腿边泛起泡沫。我不断想着，我应该在微笑。

Really, as I think about it, I'm glad to be here, even if I am stuck with Shinji. I left Instrumentality as quickly as I could, but I learned more just before it than I did during the event itself. I confirmed that I don't fear death, that I can fight without surrender until oblivion claims me. I learned that... that Mama was here all along, and she loves me. But Unit-02 is gone now, torn to shreds, and Mama with it.
真的，仔细想来，我很高兴能在这里，即使我不得不和真嗣在一起。我尽快离开了人类补完计划，但在那之前我学到的东西比在那过程中学到的还要多。我确认了自己并不畏惧死亡，我可以战斗到底，直到被遗忘吞噬。我明白了...妈妈一直在这里，她爱我。但零号机已经不复存在，被撕成了碎片，连同妈妈一起。

My eyes burn, so I close them, keeping ears alert in case Shinji returns. It's always... always too late, isn't it? Too late to do anything except regret.
我的眼睛灼痛，于是我闭上它们，保持耳朵警觉以防真嗣回来。总是...总是太迟了，不是吗？除了后悔，什么都做不了。

No, I'm glad to be here. Not because I love life or anything, but because I hated Instrumentality.
不，我很高兴能在这里。不是因为我热爱生活或别的什么，而是因为我讨厌人类补完计划。

Snapping my eyes open again, I stare coldly across the moon-kissed waters at Rei, clenching my jaw so tightly it hurts. Fuck you, Rei. Fuck your Third Impact. Fuck your ocean of blood. The world would have been just fine without it, and if I'd known what you and Shinji's old man were up to, I'd have fought you. Shinji and I both would have. He's... he's a perv and an idiot but he's not a villain.
再次睁开双眼，我冷冷地凝视着月光亲吻的水面那头的绫波，紧咬的牙关因用力过猛而疼痛。去你的，绫波。去你的第三次冲击。去你的血海。没有这一切，世界本可以安然无恙，如果我早知道你和真嗣老爹的阴谋，我一定会反抗你们。真嗣和我都会。他是个...变态又愚蠢，但绝非恶人。

Soft footsteps issue from the sand behind and above me. Swallowing, I climb to my feet again and take a deep breath once I'm upright. My face feels stiff, but there's not much I can do about it now, not with him just a few meters away.
身后和上方传来沙地上轻柔的脚步声。我咽了口唾沫，再次站起身来，挺直腰杆后深吸一口气。我的脸感觉僵硬，但此刻我无能为力，毕竟他就在几米开外。

He approaches quietly, almost diffidently, a man trying to whisper in a library he knows damn well is empty. Shortly he shuffles to a halt beside me at the edge of the sea, and something fluffs dully into the sand.
他悄无声息地走近，几乎带着一种谦卑，就像一个明知图书馆空无一人却仍试图低语的男人。不久，他在我身边的海边停下脚步，有什么东西沉闷地落在沙地上。

I swallow once more, then glance sideways. He's propped a twisted length of steel into the ground. Rebar, looks like. If straight, it would be taller than me, but abused and bent as it is, it comes to a right angle at about the height of my shoulder. It'll work. Shifting my gaze to my companion, I lift an eyebrow in silent question.
我又咽了口唾沫，然后侧目望去。他将一根扭曲的钢条插入地面。看起来像是钢筋。如果笔直的话，它会比我还高，但如今它被扭曲成这样，在我肩膀高度处形成了一个直角。这足够了。我将目光转向同伴，微微挑起眉毛，无声地询问。

"I found it speared through a car," he explains, shrugging. "No idea where it came from. Do you think it'll be too heavy?"
我发现它插在一辆车上，"他解释道，耸了耸肩。"不知道从哪儿来的。你觉得会太重吗？

In response I hold out a hand and he passes the thing to me. Even in my uncertain state I can lift it without much trouble. "It'll be fine," I decide. Shifting the makeshift crutch about, I put an arm over the bend and lean on it, pushing it another few centimeters into the sand. It'll probably bruise me, but I'll be able to move. It's better than staying here, or having Shinji fall because he's trying to carry me.
我伸出手，他便将那东西递给我。尽管状态不佳，我还是能轻松举起它。"没问题，"我判断道。调整了一下这临时拐杖的位置，我把手臂搭在弯曲处，倚靠上去，又将其往沙地里推了几厘米。虽然可能会弄伤我，但至少能动了。总比留在这里好，或者因为真嗣试图背我而让他摔倒。

He watches me cautiously, obviously ready to catch me if I fall, but shortly nods. "What do you want to do? Until it gets light, I don't know how much we--"
他小心翼翼地观察着我，显然随时准备扶住我，但很快点了点头。"你想怎么办？天亮之前，我们也不知道能走多远——"

"Let's move," I answer curtly, shifting my shoulder around on the crutch. It's hard to hold onto, lacking a handle, but it could be worse.
"我们走吧，"我简短地回答，调整了一下肩膀在拐杖上的位置。因为没有把手，抓握起来很困难，但情况本可能更糟。

"Where?" wonders Shinji uncertainly. "It's mostly streets and gas stations and stuff around here."
在哪里？" 真嗣不确定地思索着。"这附近大多是街道和加油站之类的地方。

"I don't care." Giving my head a toss, I glare at the petrified MP Evas, at Rei. "I don't care. Anywhere is better than here."
我不在乎。" 我猛地一甩头，怒视着那些僵住的量产型 EVA，还有绫波。"我不在乎。任何地方都比这里好。

### Chapter 03 Andante
行板

I watch carefully as Asuka turns around, as she struggles the first few steps away from the water. Her face, once so pretty, now tired and bandaged, is tight with the effort of moving, and probably also with the effort of keeping me from knowing how difficult it is for her. Threaded steel rebar digs into her armpit as she hobbles ahead, and I know it hurts, but she doesn't make a sound.
我仔细观察着明日香转身，看着她离开水边最初几步的挣扎。她曾经那么美丽的脸庞，如今疲惫且缠着绷带，因努力移动而紧绷，或许也因努力不让我察觉到这对她有多艰难。钢筋条嵌入她的腋下，每走一步都显得蹒跚，我知道那很痛，但她一声不吭。

After about ten paces, she shoots me a sideways glare. "Shinji, just back off. I'm tired, not an invalid."
大约走了十步后，她侧目瞪了我一眼。“真嗣，你就别跟了。我累了，又不是废人。”

I shake my head helplessly, edging a short distance farther away, but I keep my eyes on her. At least I'm Shinji now, not "idiot."
我无奈地摇摇头，稍稍退后了一点距离，但目光始终未曾离开她。至少现在我是真嗣，不再是“白痴”。

Gradually Asuka makes her way up the gentle slope and I shuffle along beside her. Her crutch digs into the wet sand with every unsteady step, and several times it catches, threatening to topple her, but she never falls.
明日香渐渐地向着缓坡上走去，我则在她身旁亦步亦趋。她的拐杖每迈出一步都在湿沙中深深插入，好几次差点绊倒，但她始终没有倒下。

On reaching the top of the hill, I step over the little white-painted wall, then offer a hand for Asuka. The gesture earns me a disgusted glance but no biting words, at least. It takes her probably twice as long to get past the mild obstacle alone as it would have with my help, but at least she didn't fall. Maybe she's right about not being crippled.
到达山顶后，我跨过那道小小的白色围墙，然后向飞鸟伸出手。这个动作换来她一个厌恶的眼神，但至少没有恶语相向。她独自越过这个小小的障碍物可能花了我帮忙所需时间的两倍，但至少她没有摔倒。也许她说的没错，她并非真的残疾。

Before resuming our exploration, however, she pauses, shifting her grip on the crutch with a grimace. "Where is everything?"
然而，在继续探索之前，她停了下来，皱着眉头调整了一下拐杖的握法。“东西都在哪儿？”

Her voice is still hoarse, not quite a croak, and it tugs at my heart to hear it, every time. I wonder how long it takes to recover from near-strangulation. "What do you mean, everything?"
她的声音依旧沙哑，不至于嘶哑，但每次听到都让我心头一紧。我好奇从近乎窒息中恢复过来需要多久。“你说的‘一切’是什么意思？”

She regards me flatly, probably thinking I'm asking just to annoy her. "The stuff you found," she clarifies. "The store."
她平淡地看着我，可能觉得我是故意问来惹她。“你找到的东西，”她解释道，“那个商店。”

Oh. "It's off that way," I answer, pointing to my left. "A few hundred meters, probably. One of those shadows over there."
哦。“在那边，”我回答，指向我的左边。“大概几百米吧，就是那边那些影子之一。”

She nods once, curtly. "A convenience store, you said? What else did they have?"
她点了一下头，干脆利落。“你说的便利店，里面还有什么？”

"Um, other stuff." I watch her reaction as I speak, but the lameness of my answer doesn't spark an outburst. She's tired, then. Talking just to be able to wait here for a while. "I couldn't really see much since it was so dark in there."
“嗯，其他的东西。”我边说边观察她的反应，但这个含糊的回答并没有激起她的怒火。看来她是累了，只是为了能在这里稍作停留而找话聊。“里面太暗了，我其实没怎么看清楚。”

"Then our first goal is to get lights," she decides. "Let's see the flashlight you got."
“那我们的首要目标是弄到照明，”她决定道。“把你拿的手电筒给我看看。”

"I don't have it anymore." I spread my hands helplessly. "What's the point, if it doesn't work?"
我已经没有了。" 我无奈地摊开双手。"如果它不能用，那还有什么意义呢？

A shadowed blue eye regards me narrowly. "Because batteries are easier to find than whole flashlights, stupid. Where is it now?"
一只阴影中的蓝眼睛狭隘地审视着我。"因为电池比整个手电筒更容易找到，笨蛋。它现在在哪里？"

"In one of the cars in the parking lot over there. By the store."
在停车场那边的一辆车里。就在商店旁边。

She starts moving before I even finish speaking, and with a sigh I a settle in beside her. At least it seems like easier going now, over sidewalk rather than sand. I can still hear the wash of the sea from up here, though it's muted.
我还没说完，她就已经开始行动了，我叹了口气，在她旁边安顿下来。至少现在走在人行道上比沙地上容易多了。尽管如此，我仍能从这里听到海浪的拍打声，只是变得微弱了。

Rubble crunches under our feet as we progress, and once again I study Asuka, trying to keep from being too obvious about it. The feet of her plugsuit are reinforced somewhat, padded with some extra rubber, but they weren't meant for walking over chunks of concrete and broken glass. At one point she stops, breath catching, then angrily kicks away an angular rock that got stuck in the padding. An icy glare silences me before I can even offer help, and I leave well enough alone.
我们前行时，碎石在脚下嘎吱作响，我再次观察着明日香，尽量不显得太明显。她的插入栓服脚部有所加固，额外垫了些橡胶，但并非设计来行走于混凝土块和碎玻璃之上。有一次她停下脚步，呼吸一滞，随后愤怒地踢开卡在垫层中的尖锐石块。一道冰冷的目光在我还未开口提供帮助前便将我噤声，我便识趣地不再多言。

"We need more clothes," she mutters as we walk. "And a bath wouldn't kill me. Or you."
“我们需要更多的衣物，”她边走边嘟囔，“还有，洗个澡也不会要了我的命，或者你的。”

"I know." A stray breeze stirs little dust devils out of the settled mayhem in the street. "I don't know where to get them, though. I doubt the store has any."
“我知道。”一阵微风拂过，从街道上沉积的混乱中卷起小小的尘旋。“但我不知道该去哪儿弄，估计商店里也没有。”

"Of course it doesn't," she snaps. "I'm just saying." Pausing for a moment, she clenches her bandaged right fist, then relaxes it, clearly trying to work circulation back into it. I wish she'd walk with the crutch under her other arm, but she's right-handed and probably didn't even think of it.
“当然没有，”她厉声道，“我只是说说而已。”她停顿片刻，紧握着缠满绷带的右手，随后又放松，显然是在努力恢复血液循环。我希望她能用另一只胳膊拄着拐杖走路，但她惯用右手，可能根本没想到这一点。

Without further conversation we proceed at an angle across the abandoned street and onto the opposite sidewalk. Silent vehicles lie here and there pointing in both directions, some glittering in the moonlight like shiny insect corpses. In an intersection a short distance away, the pavement has split, leaving a jagged crack a meter wide angling wildly through it; above, dark traffic lights stare mutely across at one another, swaying faintly in the breeze.
我们没有再多交谈，斜穿过废弃的街道，踏上了对面的便道。四处散落着静默的车辆，有的在月光下闪闪发亮，如同发光的昆虫尸体。不远处的十字路口，路面裂开了一道一米宽的锯齿状裂缝，横贯其中；上方，昏暗的交通灯无声地对视着，在微风中轻轻摇摆。

As we're making our way across the parking lot, Asuka jerks her head at me. "Go get the flashlight," she rasps. "There should be batteries in the store. Unless... oh, maybe one of the cars has keys. Headlights would work much better."
当我们穿过停车场时，明日香突然向我甩了甩头。“去拿手电筒，”她沙哑地说，“店里应该有电池。除非……哦，或许有辆车里有钥匙。车灯会好用得多。”

"They don't. I checked." Having a car might be nice in any case, but there are only two in the lot -- most people had other things to worry about when the JSSDF was invading NERV -- and neither had keys handy.
“没用的，我检查过了。”有辆车或许不错，但停车场里只有两辆——大多数人都在日本自卫队入侵 NERV 时忙于其他事情——而且两辆车上都没有钥匙。

She eyes me oddly, a little angrily, and I shrug, picking up my speed to how I normally walk. Quickly I outdistance her and find the flashlight I left sitting in the driver's seat of a dirty economy car. Pausing to dump the useless batteries out of the thing, I wander into the store, gritting my teeth as pieces of glass grind against my shoes. I had to smash the door to get in, earlier.
她用一种奇怪而略带怒意的眼神看着我，我耸了耸肩，加快脚步恢复到平常的步伐。很快我就超过了她，找到了我之前留在一辆脏兮兮的经济车驾驶座上的手电筒。停下来把里面没用的电池倒掉，我踏着碎玻璃走进商店，咬紧牙关忍受着玻璃碎片摩擦鞋底的刺耳声。之前我不得不砸碎门才能进来。

Inside the store it's almost perfectly silent, a stifling sensation after sitting near the sea for so long, and only the barest whisper of reflected moonlight from outside serves to distinguish thick shadows from one another. Keeping arms outstretched ahead of me, I feel my way towards the counter, aware of my irregular breathing as the only sound in the building.
商店内部几乎完全寂静，长时间坐在海边后，这种压抑感让人窒息，只有外面微弱的月光反射勉强区分开浓重的阴影。我伸直双臂摸索着前进，朝着柜台走去，意识到自己不规则的呼吸是这栋建筑里唯一的声音。

Soon my fingers find something, glossy paper. Magazines, then. Exhaling heavily, I fumble around, identifying things and packages by touch alone. Mints. Gum. Newspapers. Novelty keyrings. Batteries.
不久，我的手指触到了什么，光滑的纸张。是杂志。我重重地呼出一口气，继续摸索，仅凭触感辨认物品和包装。薄荷糖。口香糖。报纸。新奇的钥匙扣。电池。

Swallowing, I grab what I can, tugging the packages off their stubborn little hooks, hoping the right size and shape are represented in what the store has. A moment later, I find my way back outside with an armful of battery packages.
我咽了口唾沫，尽可能地抓取，用力从那些顽固的小挂钩上扯下包装，希望商店里有我需要的尺寸和形状。片刻后，我带着一抱电池包装回到了外面。

Once out on the sidewalk, I dump the stuff to the ground, then squat next to the pile, sorting through it by moonlight. Asuka has reached the store, I see, and is now simply leaning against its outer wall, watching me work.
一踏上人行道，我就把东西倒在地上，然后蹲在旁边，借着月光开始整理。只见明日香已经到了商店，此刻正靠在外墙上，静静地看着我忙碌。

In moments I've found what I needed and slipped it into the light. A flip of the switch sends a thin cone of silver radiance along the sidewalk, and, glancing up, I shine it at Asuka in brief celebration.
不一会儿，我找到了所需之物，轻轻将其置于光亮之中。一按开关，一道细长的银色光束沿着人行道投射出去，我抬头一瞥，短暂地将光束照向明日香，以示庆祝。

"Cut it out," she growls, shielding her eye with one hand. "And get inside. You see if you can find more lights and food, and I'll look for medicine. We're now to the point where a scratch can kill you if there are no antibiotics handy."
别闹了，"她低吼一声，用手遮住眼睛。"快进来。你去找找还有没有灯和食物，我去看看药品。现在一个小伤口都可能致命，要是没有抗生素的话。

"Yeah." Straightening, I duck through the hole I made in the door earlier and make my way towards the cash register, letting Asuka get inside on her own power. Once to the counter I set the flashlight on it, aimed at the ceiling to provide indirect light to the rest of the store's cramped interior. It's not great, something comparable to the moonlight outside, but at least it'll let us see, if not read.
"好的。"我站起身，穿过之前在门上破开的洞，径直走向收银台，让明日香自己进来。到了柜台，我把手电筒放在上面，对准天花板，为商店狭小的内部提供间接照明。虽然效果不佳，与外面的月光差不多，但至少能让我们看见，即使无法阅读。

As I'm adjusting the thing to optimize the spread of illumination, Asuka crutches silently past me and makes for the limited pharmaceutical section. After a moment I give up, then roam the few short aisles in the store. Almost immediately I find what I'm after, an automotive section of sorts, which happens to have one of those emergency flashlights that's just like the one we have now, only more expensive. I swipe it and start tugging it out of the box. "Found another light," I declare.
我正调整着那玩意儿，以优化光照的分布，这时，明日香拄着拐杖默默地从我身边经过，朝向有限的药品区走去。过了一会儿，我放弃了调整，开始在商店里那几条短短的过道间闲逛。几乎立刻，我就找到了我要找的东西——一个汽车用品区，那里恰好有一款应急手电筒，跟我们现在用的那个很像，只是价格更贵。我顺手拿了一个，开始从盒子里往外拽。“找到另一个灯了，”我宣布道。

"Good." 好。

Jaunting quickly outside to the pile of batteries, I select three of the requisite type and put them in. Then, on my way back into the store, I grab the original and hand it to Asuka. "Here."
我迅速走到外面堆放电池的地方，挑了三节所需型号的电池装上。然后，在返回商店的路上，我拿起原来的手电筒递给明日香。“给。”

"Thanks." She grabs it from my hand without even looking, then bends to examine a shelf of pill bottles.
"谢谢。" 她看都没看一眼就从我手里接过手电筒，随后弯腰检查起一货架的药瓶。

Shaking my head, I wander around, looking for lightweight and useful stuff. One item immediately catches my attention. "Hey, I found a backpack, too," I announce, tugging it off the hook it's hanging from. The flashlight shows it to have the logo of some vodka brand on it, but I could hardly care less at this point.
我摇了摇头，四处游荡，寻找轻便实用的物品。一件东西立刻吸引了我的注意。“嘿，我也找到了一个背包，”我宣布道，把它从挂钩上拽了下来。手电筒的光照下，背包上印着某个伏特加品牌的标志，但此时我对此毫不在意。

"Good," she repeats absently. "Then you'll have room to get something to drink besides water. Oh, and grab me some black licorice if you see any."
“好，”她心不在焉地重复道。“那你就有空间带些除了水以外的东西喝了。哦，如果看到的话，给我拿点黑甘草糖。”

"What? You're kidding." Frowning, I return to the food section, but it's all crap. "That stuff is nasty."
“什么？你在开玩笑吧。”我皱着眉头回到食品区，但那里都是些劣质货。“那玩意儿难吃死了。”

"You'd better get some if you want me to stay happy," she warns.
“如果你想让我保持好心情，你最好拿一些，”她警告说。

"No way. I'm not wasting the space on that." A few more bars go into the backpack as I speak, followed by a bag of soy chips and some crackers that don't look too bad. Everything else looks to be worse than nothing.
"不可能。我才不会浪费空间放那个。" 我边说边往背包里又塞了几条巧克力棒，接着是一袋豆制薯片和一些看起来还不错的饼干。剩下的东西看起来比没有还糟。

"Whatever. Fine." 随便吧。行。

Ignoring her, I make my way back to the beverage coolers and study my options. Apart from the couple shelves of water I found earlier, it's basically all soda and glitzy energy drinks. With a sigh I grab a few more waters, followed by a pair of sporty electrolyte drinks I barely recognize. If that's not good enough for her, she can bite me.
我无视她，径直回到饮料冷藏柜前，审视着我的选择。除了之前发现的几层矿泉水外，基本上全是汽水和花哨的能量饮料。我叹了口气，又抓了几瓶水，然后是两瓶我几乎认不出的运动电解质饮料。如果这还不能让她满意，那她可以咬我。

"Hey," she calls. "What kind of toothbrush do you like?"
嘿，" 她喊道，"你喜欢什么样的牙刷？

"What? I don't know. Whatever." It feels a little strange, rooting through a store I've smashed into in the middle of the night, flashlight in one hand and backpack full of loot in the other, but we need this stuff more than the owner does right now. Although... now that I think about it, the vast majority of what's in the store is in fact total garbage. Magazines talking about movies that'll probably never be shown again, and the celebrities in them who are now dissolved into LCL or orbiting the Earth in that red ring. Candy and chips that are probably more harmful than going hungry. Sodas that dehydrate you more than drinking nothing. Windshield wipers for cars no one will be making or driving for quite some time. Condoms that seem really out of place in a world with a population of two and, presumably, no STDs. I'd trade all of this for... a tent. Or... some rope, maybe? Blankets? I guess I have no idea what we'll need.
"什么？我不知道。随便吧。" 深夜闯入一家被我砸破的店铺，一手拿着手电筒，一手拎着装满赃物的背包，这种感觉有点奇怪，但我们现在比店主更需要这些东西。尽管...现在想想，店里绝大多数的东西其实都是垃圾。那些谈论可能再也不会上映的电影的杂志，以及其中如今已化为 LCL 或绕着地球那红色光环旋转的名人。可能比饿着还伤身体的糖果和薯片。比不喝还让人脱水的汽水。很久都不会有人制造或驾驶的汽车雨刷。在这个只有两个人的世界里，显然没有性病，避孕套显得格格不入。我宁愿用这一切换...一顶帐篷。或者...一些绳子，也许？毯子？我真不知道我们需要什么。

Once I'm done scavenging for food and drink, I wander back to the counter, where Asuka is clearly already done. "I got us a bunch of stuff," she reports, bouncing a little green travel bag on the palm of one hand, "and crammed it into here so it doesn't get lost among everything else." As she finishes speaking, she tosses it at me.
搜罗完食物和饮料后，我漫步回到柜台，显然，飞鸟已经完成了她的任务。“我弄了一大堆东西，”她报告说，一边用手掌轻拍着一个绿色旅行包，“都塞这里面了，免得跟其他东西混在一起找不着。”话音刚落，她就把包扔给了我。

I catch the thing awkwardly, nearly dropping it, then stuff it into the backpack. "Aren't you going to carry anything?" I mutter, hefting the bag back onto my shoulders. The drinks are heavy.
我笨拙地接住那玩意儿，差点没拿稳，随后将其塞进背包。“你就不打算带点什么吗？”我嘟囔着，重新把背包扛上肩头。那些饮料沉甸甸的。

"I'm on crutches, smartass. I can barely walk."
“我拄着拐杖呢，聪明鬼。走路都费劲。”

"Fine," I sigh. "Let's go." Turning my back on her, I flip off my flashlight and step back outside. I slosh, rattle and crunch with every step.
“好吧，”我叹了口气。“走吧。”我背对她，关掉手电筒，重新踏出户外。每走一步，都伴随着水声、碰撞声和碎裂声。

Shortly she emerges from the store and frowns at me for some reason. I frown back.
不久她从店里出来，不知为何对我皱起了眉头。我也回以皱眉。

After a moment she gives her head an imperious toss. "We need a vehicle," she decides, eyeing the two cars in the parking lot. "These don't have keys?"
过了一会儿，她傲然地甩了甩头，说道：“我们需要一辆车。”她打量着停车场里的两辆车，“这些车里没有钥匙吗？”

I shake my head. Who would leave keys in their car here? It's too bad everyone's clothes and things didn't get left behind when they all disappeared.
我摇了摇头。这里谁会把钥匙留在车里呢？可惜所有人消失时，他们的衣物和物品没有一并留下。

"Then we'll have to check the ones in the street," she shrugs. "Come on." Without waiting for me she hobbles off the curb and into the parking lot.
“那我们得去街上看看了。”她耸耸肩，“走吧。”没等我回应，她就一瘸一拐地走下路缘，进入了停车场。

I follow alongside her, silently doubting our chances of finding anything. The closest cars and trucks are all parked, and down the other way from our beach, I saw what looked like a big accident. I think all the cars that were being driven during Third Impact probably just idled along until they hit stuff, then stayed there till they ran out of gas.
我默默地跟在她身边，内心怀疑我们找到任何东西的可能性。最近的车和卡车都停着，而从我们所在的沙滩另一头望去，我看到了似乎是一起严重事故的景象。我想，在第三次冲击期间行驶的所有车辆可能都只是缓缓前行，直到撞上东西，然后就停在那里，直到耗尽汽油。

This might be a long search.
这可能是一场漫长的搜寻。

Abruptly Asuka's makeshift crutch slips forward, scraping along pavement. She stumbles to one knee, arms flailing, and the steel rebar clatters loudly to the ground beside her.
突然间，明日香自制的拐杖向前滑脱，刮擦着路面。她踉跄着跪倒在地，双臂挥舞，那根钢筋砰的一声重重落在她身旁。

One blue eye glares at me from only centimeters away before I even realize I've slid to catch her. "Hands off, perv," she hisses quietly. "If you think I'll let you cop a--"
在我意识到自己已经滑过去扶她之前，她那只蓝色的眼睛就从仅几厘米的距离外瞪着我。“把手拿开，变态，”她低声怒斥，“如果你以为我会让你占便宜——”

"Oh, calm the fuck down." The words just... slip out before I can stop them, and I feel my eyes widen in surprise and maybe a little fear. I mean, I'm relieved to death that I didn't kill her, and I'm glad she's alive, but sometimes her attitude just starts to... grate on me.
"哦，冷静点，别闹了。"这话就这么...脱口而出，我甚至来不及阻止，随即惊讶地瞪大了眼睛，或许还带着一丝恐惧。我内心其实是如释重负，庆幸自己没害死她，也高兴她还活着，但有时候她的态度就是会...让我感到烦躁。

It takes me a moment to realize she's as startled as I am, her eye comically wide, mouth open. After a moment she blinks, shifting her gaze to my arm, which is still around her waist.
我愣了一下才意识到，她和我一样震惊，眼睛瞪得圆圆的，嘴巴微张。过了一会儿，她眨了眨眼，目光转向我仍环在她腰间的手臂。

Instantly I release her and leap to my feet, tucking thumbs under the backpack straps like a kid with no mischief on his mind. Then, after brief consideration, I shuffle slowly back, out of arm's reach.
我立刻松开她，跳起身来，双手插进背包带下，像个心思单纯的孩童。随后，经过短暂的思索，我缓缓后退，保持了一段距离。

At the motion, Asuka gives her head a little shake, then reaches to retrieve the fallen crutch. On her way back up, she gives me a confused and suspicious glance, like I've just played some trick on her and she's still trying to figure it out, but she says nothing.
看到我的动作，明日香轻轻摇了摇头，伸手去捡掉落的拐杖。起身时，她向我投来困惑而怀疑的一瞥，仿佛我刚对她耍了什么把戏，而她还在试图弄明白，但她什么也没说。

We're a good five steps away before I realize I'm in the clear. I... I don't think I've ever sworn at her before, even when she deserved it, and it didn't get a reaction at all. No yelling, no threats, no shoulder-punches. Nothing.
我们走出好几步后，我才意识到自己已经安全了。我...我好像从没对她发过誓，即使她该受责备时也没有，而这次却毫无反应。没有喊叫，没有威胁，没有肩部撞击。什么都没有。

Huh. I'll have to keep that in mind. I don't know if I could do it on purpose, though. Not convincingly.
嗯。我得记住这一点。不过，我不知道我是否能故意这么做，而且做得让人信服。

In moments we reach the nearest car to the parking lot, an unremarkable white compact. Asuka slows and stops, watching as I try the doors, eventually smashing the window in with my flashlight. After a brief search, though, my efforts prove fruitless. "No keys," I sigh. "Nothing at all here. Unless you want a map of Nara, or a grape-scented air freshener."
转眼间，我们来到了停车场附近的一辆白色紧凑型车旁。明日香放慢脚步停下，看着我尝试打开车门，最终用我的手电筒砸碎了车窗。然而，经过一番搜寻，我的努力一无所获。“没有钥匙，”我叹了口气。“这里什么都没有。除非你想要一张奈良地图，或者一个葡萄味的空气清新剂。”

As I climb out of the car, Asuka studies me briefly, lips pursed, then glances down the street. "We should search separately," she notes quietly. "I'll take the cars on this side of the road, and you can have the ones on that side."
当我从车里爬出来时，明日香短暂地打量了我一下，嘴唇紧闭，然后朝街道望去。“我们应该分开搜寻，”她轻声说道。“我负责马路这边的车辆，你可以搜查那边的车。”

I shrug and do as she suggests, though there are only a few in easy reach for either of us. Quickly I root through two cars and a little delivery truck, finding no keys. In the truck, however, I encounter a jug of gasoline, which sets me to thinking. I could just fill up one of these... but no, I'd still be missing the keys. And the cars that were running have probably all hit stuff and maybe been damaged, and if not, the batteries are probably dead now in any case.
我耸耸肩，按照她的建议行动，尽管我们俩伸手可及的地方只有寥寥几样东西。我迅速翻找了两辆车和一辆小型送货卡车，没有找到钥匙。但在卡车里，我发现了一罐汽油，这让我开始思考。我本可以给其中一辆车加满油...但不行，我还是缺钥匙。而且那些还在行驶的车可能都已经撞到了东西，或许已经损坏，即便没有，电池现在大概也耗尽了。

Setting the spare gas back on the floor of the truck cab, I shake my head and shut the door again. Well, it's a thought, if we get lucky.
我把备用汽油放回卡车驾驶室的地板上，摇了摇头，再次关上门。嗯，如果运气好，这或许是个办法。

Adjusting the straps of the backpack, I make my way back to Asuka. "Nothing," I declare. "A thing of gas, and that's it."
调整好背包的肩带，我走回明日香身边。"什么也没有，"我宣布，"只有一罐汽油。"

She blinks at me, seeming to awake from a trance, then stares through the smashed window of a sports car. Leaning carefully into the vehicle, she checks the ignition and behind the visors, then quickly comes out empty-handed. "Yeah. Nothing here, too."
她眨了眨眼，仿佛从恍惚中醒来，然后透过一辆跑车的破碎车窗凝视着。她小心翼翼地探身进车，检查了点火器和遮阳板后面，然后迅速空手而出。"是啊，这里也没有。"

I hesitate, frowning at the car. "Asuka, this one was unlocked."
我犹豫着，皱眉看着那辆车。“明日香，这辆车没锁。”

She follows my gaze to the power lock on the passenger's door, which shows red to say it's open. Then she shakes her head. "I'm... tired," she mutters. "This is silly. We should be doing this in the daylight anyway."
她顺着我的目光看向乘客座的车门锁，红灯亮着表示车门开着。然后她摇了摇头。“我……累了，”她嘟囔道，“这太傻了。我们本来就应该在白天做这件事。”

I said that in the very beginning, I recall, but I just nod. "Where do you want to sleep? Middle of the street?"
我记得一开始我就这么说过，但我只是点了点头。“你想睡哪儿？马路中间？”

"That's idiotic," she snorts. "There could still be people, even if you don't think there are, and I don't want to get run over in my sleep. The sidewalk should be fine, though," she decides, nodding to one side. "Did you get blankets or pillows?"
“那太蠢了，”她嗤之以鼻，“就算你觉得没人，也可能还有人在，我不想在睡梦中被车撞。人行道应该没问题，”她决定道，向一边点头，“你带了毯子或枕头吗？”

"There weren't any." I have to wonder why she thinks a public sidewalk is okay to sleep on, if she's worried about other people, but I don't bother to call her on it. Instead, as she hobbles to the curb, I hop up and start kicking an area of cement free of dust and rubble, as much as I can with just my shoe. Maybe next time I'm in a store I'll get a broom.
"那里什么也没有。" 我不禁纳闷，既然她担心别人，为何还觉得睡在公共人行道上没问题，但我没打算揭穿她。相反，当她一瘸一拐走向路边时，我跳起来，开始用鞋尽可能地踢掉水泥地上的灰尘和碎石。也许下次进店我会买把扫帚。

Once I'm done she simply drops to her plugsuited backside where she stands, then sets the crutch aside with a grimace and starts working her shoulder. "Gimme the backpack," she commands. "I want some more water."
清理完毕后，她直接原地坐下，背靠着墙，皱着眉头把拐杖放到一边，开始活动肩膀。"把背包给我，"她命令道，"我想再喝点水。"

Without a word I set the thing in front of her, then stretch my back as she starts to root through it. I let her, trying not to grin at how the water is mostly at the bottom, under the more fragile and lighter stuff.
我默默地把背包放在她面前，然后伸展了一下背部，任由她翻找。我尽量不笑出来，因为水大多沉在底部，上面压着更易碎轻巧的物品。

While she takes a few swallows of water, I find the stuff she picked out and paw through it. She got toothbrushes, like she said, as well as a bottle of aspirin, some bandages and antibiotic cream, and... a bunch of stuff, it looks like. Half a first aid kit, almost.
趁她喝水的时候，我翻看她挑选的物品。正如她所说，有牙刷，还有一瓶阿司匹林、一些绷带和抗生素软膏，以及……一堆东西，看起来像是半个急救箱。

After seeing to our immediate needs, at least those not involving privacy, the two of us lie down a meter or so apart, both staring at the sky. I'm a little surprised she didn't make me go farther away, but I suppose she's just too tired to argue over it.
在满足了我们不涉及隐私的迫切需求后，我们两人相隔一米左右躺下，一同仰望天空。我有些惊讶她没有让我走得更远，但我想她可能只是太累了，懒得为此争执。

"The stars," she states cryptically, quietly, as I'm settling in. "I... keep thinking about how bright they are."
“星星，”她神秘而轻声地说道，就在我安顿下来时。“我……一直在想它们有多亮。”

"I know." I squirm around briefly, trying to get comfortable, then eventually give in and tuck a water bottle under my head as a bad makeshift pillow. "No light pollution."
“我知道。”我扭动了一会儿，试图找到舒适的姿势，最终还是妥协，把一个水瓶塞到头下，权当糟糕的临时枕头。“没有光污染。”

Asuka doesn't answer, and the silence stretches. I find I'm not sure if it's an awkward silence, whether she thinks the conversation is over or not.
明日香没有回应，沉默持续着。我不确定这是否是一种尴尬的沉默，也不知道她是否认为对话已经结束。

Eventually, though, my curiosity gets the better of me and I clear my throat. We'll have to talk about this at some point. "Hey, Asuka?"
终究，好奇心还是占了上风，我清了清嗓子。这事迟早得谈一谈。“嘿，明日香？”

"Hmm." “嗯。”

"What... what did you see?" I lick my lips. "What do you remember?"
“你...你看到了什么？”我舔了舔嘴唇。“你记得什么？”

"You should know." Her words are clipped, her voice flat. "You were there."
“你应该清楚。”她的话语简短，声音毫无起伏。“你当时在场。”

Right. So... she remembers the argument in the kitchen, then. The conversation from the train too, probably.
对。那么...她记得厨房里的争吵，然后。火车上的对话大概也记得。

Maybe we don't need to talk about it quite yet. Yeah. Better to... to leave that one alone, for now. Let things settle.
或许我们暂时还不需要谈及此事。嗯。最好还是...先别碰这个话题，让事情沉淀一下。

The night is still and stifling, both from heat and silence. As I unbutton my outer shirt for a little more air, a soft sound from the side catches my attention, and I freeze to hear it better.
夜晚静谧而闷热，既因高温也因寂静。当我解开外衣扣子以求一丝凉意时，旁边传来一阵微弱声响，我顿时定住，凝神细听。

Asuka is snoring. Not a full-fledged, log-sawing type of snore, but instead that distinctive style of breathing that is just heavier than normal, and tells me without a doubt that she's asleep. Already. It hasn't even been five minutes.
明日香在打鼾。并非那种震天响的鼾声，而是一种比平常呼吸略重的独特方式，无疑告诉我她已经睡着了。这么快。连五分钟都不到。

Smiling slightly, I finish unbuttoning my shirt and let my eyes slide shut. I'm not used to sleeping anywhere near anyone else, however, so slumber takes its time in claiming me. What rest I do get is fitful.
我微微一笑，扣子已全部解开，闭上双眼。我不习惯在他人附近入睡，因此，沉睡迟迟不来，即便入眠，也是断断续续。

Once, on waking up, I can hear her sniffling.
有一次醒来，我能听见她在抽泣。

I keep my silence. She doesn't want me to know.
我保持沉默。她不想让我知道。

The next morning, I awake before she does. It's sunny, totally cloudless, and my guess is that it's an hour or so past dawn. Sitting up, I stifle a yawn with a fist and glance around, but the city hasn't changed at all. It's still empty. Still lifeless.
第二天早晨，我比她先醒来。阳光明媚，万里无云，我猜想大约是日出后一小时。我坐起身，用拳头掩住呵欠，环顾四周，但这座城市毫无变化。依旧空无一人，依旧死气沉沉。

A sideways glance shows me that Asuka is still asleep, curled up on her side, facing away from me. Her hair is so full of dust and dirt that it's as grey as it is red, and the plugsuit shows me the subtle bumps of her vertebrae. Those suits don't breathe very well, unless in liquid, and with it sunny today... I'm not looking forward to pleasant company.
斜眼一瞥，只见明日香依旧沉睡，蜷缩着侧身背对我。她的头发沾满了尘土，灰红交错，紧身的驾驶服勾勒出她脊椎骨的微妙起伏。这种服装透气性不佳，除非浸泡在液体中，而今天阳光明媚...我不期待会有愉快的陪伴。

Shaking my head, I climb to my feet and slap the dust off my back, then roam across the street to a fast food restaurant with its sign leaning drunkenly. After seeing to a mundane physical need and dumping some water over my hands, I make my way back to the sidewalk only to find that Asuka is awake.
我摇摇头，站起身来拍掉背上的尘土，然后穿过街道，走向一家招牌歪斜的快餐店。解决完生理需求，往手上泼了些水后，我回到人行道上，却发现明日香已经醒来。

"Where were you?" she asks accusingly while I'm still crossing the street. Her voice, at least, is free from the hoarseness that marked it yesterday.
“你去哪儿了？”我还在过马路时，她便带着责问的语气问道。至少，她的声音没有了昨日的沙哑。

I lift my eyebrows at this, wondering why she really needs to know. "How do you feel today? Can you stand?"
我对此挑了挑眉，纳闷她为何非得知道不可。“你今天感觉怎么样？能站起来吗？”

She scowls briefly, perhaps thinking to call me on my subject change, but eventually she grunts and climbs to her feet. "I'm better. I can probably walk, but not for..." She trails off, gazing to where her rebar crutch lies on the ground.
她皱了皱眉，或许在考虑是否要揭穿我转移话题的伎俩，但最终她哼了一声，站起身来。“我感觉好多了。应该能走，但走不了……”她话音渐弱，目光落在地上的钢筋拐杖上。

But not for too long. She didn't want to admit that aloud, did she? Why the hell not? Did she think I wouldn't know regardless? Trying not to roll my eyes, I step up the curb, grab her crutch and hand it to her. "Good. Let's start moving."
但也不能走太久。她不想大声承认这一点，对吧？为什么不说出来？难道她以为我不明白吗？我忍住翻白眼的冲动，跨上人行道，捡起她的拐杖递给她。“很好。我们开始走吧。”

While I'm bending to gather our stuff into the backpack, I can feel her eye on me. "You know," she begins after a moment, "we really need to find a house and a car, but the house probably first. We need more clothes, and showers -- I'll bet the water is still working, even if the power is off -- and some better food. Plus, it'll probably be easier to steal a car from a house, where it's like to have both gas and keys nearby."
当我弯腰将我们的东西收拾进背包时，能感觉到她的目光落在我身上。“你知道，”她过了一会儿开口道，“我们真的需要找个房子和一辆车，但房子应该是首要的。我们需要更多衣物，还有洗澡——我敢打赌，即使停电了，水应该还能用——还有更好的食物。而且，从房子里偷车可能更容易，那里很可能既有汽油又有钥匙。”

"Oh. Good point." Zipping the backpack up, I slip it over my shoulders and straighten. In the daylight I can see farther and better, obviously, and in the distance before our current street disappears around a wooded hill, I can see it's mostly strip malls and auto shops and isolated little stores. "Up one of these side streets," I reason, pointing, "there's probably a residential district." We're in the suburbs, which fortunately should contain lots of houses. Not that there's much left of the city besides the suburbs in any case.
"哦，有道理。"我拉上背包的拉链，将其背在肩上，站直身体。在日光下，我的视野和能见度显然更佳，远处，在我们所在的街道即将消失于一片林木覆盖的山丘之前，我看到那里大多是商业街区和汽车修理店，以及零星的小店铺。"拐进这些侧街之一，"我推测着，指向前方，"很可能就有住宅区。"我们身处郊区，幸运的是，这里应该遍布着许多房屋。不管怎样，城市除了郊区之外，也没剩下多少了。

She sets off without waiting for me, using her former crutch like a walking stick, and though she's not moving fast, it's much better than last night. It doesn't take me long to catch up. I still slosh with every step, and it occurs to me to wonder why I felt it was necessary to grab so much water when I could probably find more just as easily anywhere.
她不等我便出发了，将之前的拐杖当作手杖使用，尽管她走得不快，但比起昨晚已经好多了。我很快就赶了上去。每走一步，我仍能感觉到水声，这时我突然想到，当初为何觉得有必要带上这么多水，明明在任何地方都可能轻易找到更多。

Asuka seems happy to take the lead, and I'm more than willing to let her, since every direction from here is probably equally good. In moments we reach an intersection after walking maybe a quarter of a kilometer, but there Asuka stops, leaning tiredly on her crutch.
明日香似乎很乐意领路，而我也很愿意让她带头，毕竟从这里出发，无论哪个方向可能都一样好。不久，我们走了大约四分之一公里后到达一个十字路口，但就在那里，明日香停了下来，疲惫地倚靠在她的拐杖上。

I say nothing, instead staring up the street, pretending she's not displaying weakness in front of me. It looks like we have only another two blocks of strip mall, and then the trees take over what I can see, but that probably means homes. Or a park, I suppose. Leaves rustle in a breeze I can't feel here, and it's nice to see something green.
我默不作声，只是抬头望向街道，假装没看见她在我面前显露的脆弱。看来我们只需再穿过两个街区，那片商业区就会结束，随后映入眼帘的将是树木，但那很可能意味着住宅区。或者是个公园，我想。树叶在微风中沙沙作响，而我这里却感受不到，能看到些绿色总是好的。

"Shinji, you should probably go on ahead," she suggests, lifting her head to eye me sideways. Dull red hair hangs past her good eye, almost obscuring it. "I'll be slower, and I really hate walking in the plugsuit. If you can find a car and bring it back here to pick me up, that would be good."
“真嗣，你或许应该先走一步，”她提议道，抬起头斜眼瞥向我。暗红色的头发垂过她那只完好的眼睛，几乎将其遮住。“我会走得慢些，而且我真的很讨厌穿着插入栓服走路。如果你能找到辆车，开回来接我，那就太好了。”

I realize I'm rubbing the back of my head, and drop my hand with conscious effort. "I don't know how to drive, Asuka."
我意识到自己在揉后脑勺，便刻意放下手。“我不会开车，明日香。”

Her eye widens for a moment, but then she actually laughs. At me, of course, but it's good to see her showing some humor. "Oh, that's great," she sighs, giggling as she eyes me again. "Kaji taught me to drive when I was twelve. Look, all you do is turn on the ignition, then put it in gear. The right pedal is the accelerator and the left should be the brake."
她的眼睛瞬间瞪大，但随即她真的笑了起来。当然是笑我，不过能看到她展现幽默感也是好的。“哦，这太棒了，”她叹息着，边笑边再次打量我。“我十二岁时，加持就教我开车了。听着，你只需启动引擎，然后挂挡。右边的踏板是油门，左边的应该是刹车。”

I suck air between my teeth, considering. "Well, what if it's a manual?"
我嘬着牙，思索着。“那，万一是个手册呢？”

"Find another car." “再找辆车。”

"Whatever. Fine." Shaking my head, I take a step down the street, then stop, slowly turning back to face her. "What about... are... are you okay being alone?" It seems risky to ask this, since this sort of question usually sets her off, but she touched my cheek back on the beach. I... don't really know what to expect from her anymore. I wonder if she does either.
“随你便。行吧。”我摇摇头，沿着街道迈出一步，却又停下，缓缓转回身面对她。“那...你...你一个人待着没事吧？”问这种问题似乎有风险，因为这类问题通常会激怒她，但她在海滩上曾轻抚过我的脸颊。我...真的不知道还能从她那里期待什么。我怀疑她自己是否也清楚。

Her face tightens fractionally and she doesn't answer for a moment. "Just get a car," she snaps eventually.
她的脸色微微一紧，沉默了片刻。“赶紧弄辆车来，”她最终厉声说道。

Without another word I turn my back on her and start walking. This street seems like it must have been less busy than the one along the shore; I can see only one car, and it's plowed into the base of a streetlight.
我一言不发，转身背对她，开始前行。这条街似乎比海边的街道更为冷清；我只看到一辆车，它撞进了路灯的基座。

Soon the street begins a gentle rise and the trees begin. It's indeed a residential district, full of smallish houses cramped fairly closely together. Choosing one at random, I approach slowly, uncertain how to break in, feeling oddly like ringing the doorbell would just be better. After a moment I sigh and slip out of the backpack, then hunt around for something heavy. I find it in the form of a greyish rock at the base of a yew tree.
不久，街道开始缓缓上坡，树木也逐渐出现。这里确实是个住宅区，挤满了紧凑排列的小房子。我随意选了一栋，慢慢靠近，犹豫着如何闯入，感觉奇怪地认为按门铃或许更合适。片刻后，我叹了口气，卸下背包，四处寻找重物。我在一棵紫杉树根部找到了一块灰色的石头。

With rock in hand, I stagger back to the house, remembering only now to check the door -- turns out it is locked -- then heave it through the front window. Glass shatters and the rock thumps onto the interior floor with a force I can feel outside. Uncomfortably I produce the emergency flashlight and use it to poke out the odd fragments of glass still sticking out from the bottom of the sill, then climb inside.
手持石头，我蹒跚回到那栋房子前，这才想起检查门是否上锁——果然锁着——于是用力将石头扔向了前窗。玻璃碎裂，石头重重地砸在室内的地板上，震动感传到了外面。我有些不安地拿出应急手电筒，用它拨开窗台底部残留的碎玻璃片，然后爬了进去。

The house, it seems, is nothing special, just a bunch of rooms crammed together so tightly there's almost no need for a hallway. Misato's apartment was almost as big. As I step carefully around, exploring, the condition of the place begins to speak somewhat ill of its owner; dirty dishes are still piled in the sink, the traces of food on them long since molding, and there's a messy pile of mail taking up most of the counter space. Though I spot a litter box in the corner of the only bedroom, I see no sign of any cat, which makes me suddenly sad.
这房子看起来并无特别之处，只是将多个房间紧密堆砌，以至于几乎不需要走廊。美里小姐的公寓也差不多大。我小心翼翼地四处走动，探索着，屋内的状况开始透露出其主人的些许不堪；脏盘子仍堆积在水槽中，上面的食物痕迹早已发霉，而一大堆杂乱的邮件占据了大部分的台面空间。尽管我在唯一的卧室角落发现了一个猫砂盆，却不见任何猫的踪迹，这让我突然感到悲伤。

I also find no keys -- unsurprising, since a lot of people don't have cars -- and the clothes on the bed and floor are obviously a woman's, someone bigger than Asuka. One thing that does catch my interest, seemingly out-of-place, is a baseball bat leaning next to the front door. After a moment I take it. It'll make future break-ins easier.
我也未找到钥匙——这并不意外，因为许多人并无汽车——而床和地板上的衣物显然属于一位女性，体型比明日香要大。有一件事引起了我的兴趣，看似格格不入，那就是靠在前门旁的一根棒球棒。片刻之后，我将其拿起。这将使未来的闯入行动更为容易。

Only a minute or so after entering the house I leave it again, walking out the front door. The backpack finds its way back onto my protesting shoulders, and armed with a bat I make my way to the next house and smash the windows without hesitation.
进入房子仅一分钟左右，我又再次离开，走出前门。背包重新压在我抗议的肩膀上，手持棒球棒，我毫不犹豫地前往下一栋房子，砸碎了窗户。

This house seems a little larger, though on closer inspection it only seems so due to a lack of clutter. An older couple lives here -- lived here -- as evidenced by the smiling pictures on the walls, and I quickly find a set of keys on a peg by the door. Smiling, I hurry back to the broken window and push the unlock button on the remote. A car parked across the streets flashes its lights once in response, and I feel like giggling.
这栋房子看起来似乎大一些，但细看之下，只是因为少了杂乱无章的物品才显得如此。一对老夫妇曾住在这里——墙上挂着的笑脸照片便是证明——我很快在门边的挂钩上找到了一串钥匙。我笑着匆忙返回破窗处，按下遥控器的解锁键。街对面停放的一辆车闪烁了一下灯光作为回应，我忍不住想笑出声来。

Leaping right back out the window, I stagger a little on landing - forgot about the backpack -- but I make it over to the car in seconds. It's a small vehicle, angular and grey and very boring. An old-person car. But it's mine now. Ours.
我立刻从窗户跳出，落地时因背包的重量踉跄了一下——忘了它的存在——但几秒钟内就跑到了车旁。这是一辆小型车，棱角分明，灰色且十分乏味，典型的老年人用车。但现在，它是我的了。我们的。

The backpack and the bat go quickly into the back seat, and after a moment I climb into the driver's. Despite what I told Asuka I do know how cars work, even if I've never driven one myself; slipping the key into the ignition, I twist, and nearly sag with relief when the engine chugs to life. Exhaling heavily, I shift it into drive and hit the gas.
背包和球棒迅速被扔进后座，我稍作停顿后坐进了驾驶位。尽管我告诉过明日香我不懂车，其实我明白汽车的工作原理，只是从未亲自驾驶过；我将钥匙插入点火器，一扭，当引擎发出启动的轰鸣声时，我几乎松了一口气。我深吸一口气，将车挂入前进档，踩下了油门。

Only it doesn't shift. What the hell? Frowning, I try again, but the gear stick just doesn't budge, like there's some invisible block holding it in park. After a moment I remember to release the parking brake, but it still doesn't move.
它就是不动。搞什么鬼？我皱着眉头又试了一次，但变速杆就是纹丝不动，仿佛有什么无形的障碍让它卡在了停车档。过了一会儿，我记起要松开手刹，但它还是不动。

Feeling a little more panicked, I scan quickly over the dashboard, looking for something to tell me what's going on. The radio hissing static doesn't help me concentrate, so I turn it off and chew a lip.
感到更加慌张，我迅速扫视仪表盘，寻找能告诉我发生了什么的线索。收音机里嘶嘶作响的静电干扰让我难以集中注意力，于是我关掉它，咬着嘴唇。

Long moments later I manage to try shifting while holding the brake pedal down, and that works. Crap. Asuka should have said something about that; I was about to go find another car.
过了好一会儿，我尝试在踩住刹车踏板的同时换挡，这才成功。真是的。明日香本该提醒我这一点；我差点就要去找另一辆车了。

Running a hand through my hair, I let up the brake and hit the gas, only to lurch back in my seat as the car jerks forward. Reflexively I hit the brake again, only to have the seat belt save me from smacking my head on the windshield.
我用手捋了捋头发，松开刹车踩下油门，却猛地往后一仰，因为车子突然向前冲去。我本能地再次踩下刹车，幸好安全带救了我，没让我一头撞上前挡风玻璃。

God damn it. The car purrs idly while I calm my thundering heart.
该死。汽车悠闲地低鸣着，而我则在平复狂跳的心。

By the time I manage to pull away from the curb and head down the street, Asuka is already halfway to the house. She watches with mixed frustration and amusement while I spend a minute or so turning the vehicle around to present the passenger's door to her.
当我好不容易从路边驶离，沿着街道前行时，明日香已经快到家门口了。她带着几分无奈和好笑，看着我花了大约一分钟时间把车掉头，好让她能从副驾驶门上车。

"Nice driving, slick," she offers flippantly as she settles in to the empty seat and pulls the door closed. Dried LCL flakes off her plugsuit and onto the white seat. "Maybe tomorrow I'll show you how it's really done."
“车技不错嘛，老兄。”她一边坐进空位，一边漫不经心地调侃，随手关上车门。干掉的 LCL 从她的插入栓服上掉落，沾在了白色座椅上。“或许明天我该教教你真正的驾驶技术。”

"With this thing?" I wonder, craning my neck around, but obviously there are no other cars coming. "I doubt it goes very fast."
“用这玩意儿？”我扭头环顾，显然没有其他车辆驶来，“我怀疑它根本跑不快。”

"We'll find another car," she promises. "Something more suitable for me. Though this one should be just fine for you."
我们会找到另一辆车，"她承诺道，"更适合我的那种。不过这辆对你来说应该挺合适的。

"Where do you want to go?" I manage to ask, tightly. We have a car now, but I'm not even sure how useful it is, with resources available for scavenging just about anywhere.
"你想去哪儿？"我勉强问道，语气紧张。现在我们有了车，但我甚至不确定它有多大用处，毕竟到处都能找到可供搜寻的资源。

"I don't care. Just drive."
无所谓。开就是了。

"What?" I glance over at her, startled. "Look, if you don't care where we go, then right here should be--"
什么？"我惊讶地瞥了她一眼，"听着，如果你不在乎去哪儿，那这里就——

"I said drive," she snaps, facing forward. Her bandaged eye is the one on my side; I can't read her face. "I don't want to be by the water. Just go."
我说开车，"她厉声说道，面向前方。她包扎着的那只眼睛在我这边；我看不清她的表情。"我不想靠近水边。快走。

My fingers tighten on the steering wheel. "Do you want to drive?"
我紧握方向盘的手指用力了些。"你想来开吗？"

"Go!"

Biting back a retort, I feed the car some gas and get us moving. Asuka settles into a chilly silence beside me, but I'm smart enough not to ask what the hell I did to make her mad.
我忍住反驳，给车子加了点油，让我们动了起来。明日香在我旁边陷入了冰冷的沉默，但我足够聪明，不会去问到底做了什么让她生气。

The going is slow. Tokyo-3's streets are not in good repair at the moment, so often I have to edge the vehicle around holes in the pavement, and sometimes I have to backtrack or avoid whole blocks on account of accidents or downed trees blocking the way. At one point we pass a little park and I slow down to examine it, but the pond in its center looks reddish. Like the ocean. I don't need Asuka's grim scowl to tell me to keep moving.
行进缓慢。东京第三区的街道目前状况不佳，我经常不得不小心翼翼地绕过路面上的坑洞，有时还得倒车或避开整片街区，因为事故或倒下的树木挡住了去路。有一次我们经过一个小公园，我放慢速度仔细观察，但中心池塘的水看起来泛红。就像海洋一样。我不需要明日香阴沉的皱眉来告诉我继续前进。

Later, maybe half an hour after we start, she twists and fumbles for the door handle, though we're still moving. "Stop," she commands. "I need to... just stop."
后来，大约在我们出发半小时后，她扭动身体，摸索着车门把手，尽管我们仍在行驶中。“停下，”她命令道，“我需要……就停下。”

Shrugging, I pull over to the curb and turn the car off. Asuka opens the door and staggers out onto somebody's lawn, hands on knees, breathing deeply like she's trying to avoid being sick.
我耸了耸肩，将车靠边停下并熄火。明日香打开车门，踉跄地走到某家的草坪上，双手撑着膝盖，深呼吸着，仿佛在努力避免呕吐。

After a moment I get out and join her, hovering uncertainly nearby. "Are you okay? Want some water or something?"
过了一会儿，我下车走向她，犹豫地站在附近。“你还好吗？要喝点水吗？”

"No," she snaps. "I just need..." Pausing, she draws a deep breath, then lets it out raggedly. "Actually... yeah. That... might be nice."
“不用，”她厉声说，“我只是需要……”她停顿了一下，深吸一口气，然后断断续续地呼出。“其实……是的。那……可能会好些。”

Nodding, I return to the car and dig through our backpack until I find an unopened bottle of water. When I get back to her, she's standing upright again, though she looks more pale than normal. My fingers brush the bandages on her hand as I pass the bottle to her.
我点了点头，回到车里，翻找我们的背包，直到找到一瓶未开封的水。当我回到她身边时，她已经重新站直，但脸色比平时更加苍白。我把水瓶递给她时，手指轻触到她手上的绷带。

"Thanks," she offers halfheartedly, though her good eye cuts away from mine as she says it. Cracking and unscrewing the cap, she starts gulping the water down.
"谢谢，"她有些心不在焉地说，尽管她的好眼避开我的目光。她拧开瓶盖，开始大口喝水。

I draw back, leaning against the car. Behind me, it ticks idly as it cools, the only sound in the world beside the whisper of breeze among leaves and Asuka swallowing.
我退后一步，靠在车上。身后，车子在冷却中发出悠闲的滴答声，这是世界上除了树叶间微风的低语和明日香吞咽声之外唯一的声响。

Once half the bottle is gone she stops, taking a deep breath and wiping her mouth with the back of her other hand. One blue eye blinks almost uncertainly at me. "I... I have to get out of this plugsuit," she admits quietly. "It's so hot and... it's gonna kill me if I keep this up."
喝掉半瓶水后，她停了下来，深吸一口气，用另一只手背擦了擦嘴。一只蓝眼睛几乎不确定地眨着看向我。"我...我得脱掉这身插入栓服，"她轻声承认，"太热了，再这样下去我会受不了的。"

I nod my understanding. "There should be plenty of clothes in these houses," I point out. We still haven't left the residential district, though the houses here are a little bigger, a little nicer. "We both need to change, really." My school uniform is ruined, from both dust and dry LCL, and it seems weird to wear it without any schools around anyway. It's not well-suited to outdoorsmanship, and I suspect there will be a fair amount of that in our future.
我点头表示理解。“这些房子里应该有不少衣服，”我指出。我们仍未离开住宅区，尽管这里的房子稍大一些，也更漂亮些。“我们俩确实都需要换衣服。”我的校服已经毁了，沾满了灰尘和干涸的 LCL，而且周围也没有学校，穿着它总感觉怪怪的。它并不适合户外活动，而我猜想我们未来的日子里少不了这些。

"Let's break into one of these," she suggests, turning around to nod at the row of tree-shaded houses behind her. "I should be able to get enough water to shower or bathe or something, and if I do... can you look around the neighborhood for clothes?" She finishes this in a high, almost pleading tone, her face open. The heat really must be getting to her.
“我们闯进其中一栋吧，”她提议道，转身向身后那排树荫下的房子点头。“我应该能弄到足够的水来洗澡或什么的，如果我洗了……你能在这附近找找衣服吗？”她用一种高亢、近乎恳求的语气说完，脸上满是期待。这酷热真的让她难以忍受。

"No problem." Meeting her gaze a moment longer, I head back to grab the bat, then trot the nearest house and open it up.
“没问题。”我与她对视片刻，回去拿起球棒，然后快步走向最近的房子，将其打开。

Asuka crutches in the moment I push the front door open, and I follow her to the bathroom, a fairly plush, if compact, space furnished mostly with marble. While I stand in the doorway, she lifts the handle on the faucet and waits, frowning. Her eye finds mine in the mirror and narrows.
就在我推开前门的那一刻，明日香顺势拄着拐杖，我跟随着她来到浴室，一个相当豪华却紧凑的空间，主要以大理石装饰。我站在门口，她拧开龙头把手，皱着眉头等待。她的目光在镜中与我对视，眼神锐利。

Long, tense seconds later, the faucet splutters and chokes, spitting brown water into the sink. It runs for a time, hiccuping occasionally, and the stream gradually turns clear.
经过漫长而紧张的几秒钟，水龙头开始噗噗作响，吐出棕色的水流进洗手池。水流持续了一会儿，偶尔打嗝，渐渐变得清澈。

Asuka sags in visible relief. "Thank God," she mutters, turning to face me. "I'm showering. If you find clothes for me, knock on the door, then drop them on the floor inside here when I tell you you can come in. If you stay a second longer than you have to, I swear to God you're getting two centimeters of steel rebar through an eye socket."
明日香明显松了一口气，喃喃自语：“谢天谢地。”她转过身面对我，“我要洗澡了。如果你找到我的衣服，先敲门，等我让你进来时，把衣服放在地板上。你要是敢多待一秒，我发誓会让你眼窝里插进两厘米的钢筋。”

Don't flatter yourself, brat. "I'm taking my flashlight," I decide curtly, nodding. "One should be enough for you."
别自作多情了，小鬼。“我要拿走我的手电筒，”我断然决定，点头道，“一个对你来说足够了。”

"Fine." The door closes in my face.
"好吧。"门在我面前砰地关上了。

Muttering, I heft the bat to my shoulder and make my way through a minimally-decorated but comfortable living room and step outside. For a moment I just stand there, glancing around the neighborhood, wondering at this turn of events, wondering how I turned out to enjoy breaking and entering, but I can hardly make myself care too much.
我嘟囔着，把球棒扛在肩上，穿过装饰简约却舒适的客厅，走到屋外。我站在那里，环顾四周的街区，对这突如其来的变故感到疑惑，好奇自己怎么就喜欢上了破门而入，但我几乎无法让自己太过在意。

With a shrug I head towards the next house over. There are much larger concerns looming in front of me in any case.
我耸了耸肩，朝隔壁的房子走去。无论如何，我面前还有更大的问题需要面对。

Maybe half an hour later I find my way back to our house, only to realize Asuka is still in the bathroom. Figures. Dropping the bundle of stuff I found for myself, I knock on the door and wait.
大约半小时后，我回到了我们的家，却发现明日香还在浴室里。不出所料。我把找到的一包东西放下，敲了敲门，然后等待着。

"You can come in." 你可以进来了。

Pushing my way into the room, I toss a handful of garments onto the floor rug. "I got you clothes and underwear, but sandals instead of shoes since I didn't know what size you wore."
我挤进房间，随手将一把衣物扔在地毯上。"我给你买了衣服和内衣，但考虑到不知道你鞋码，就买了凉鞋。"

There's no response from the other side of the vivid-purple shower curtain. After a moment I sigh and leave, pulling the door shut behind me.
那鲜艳紫色的浴帘另一侧毫无回应。片刻后，我叹了口气，转身离开，顺手将门带上。

As I flop onto a bed in the largest bedroom, I find myself actually wondering if she's okay. Her discarded plugsuit was lying on the floor next to the tub, with her bandages atop it. I didn't see any blood or anything, so I'm hoping whatever wounds she had are gone -- and I don't know why they wouldn't be -- but it's unlike her not to take a crack at me in a situation like that.
当我倒在最大卧室的床上时，发现自己竟真的在担心她是否安好。她脱下的驾驶服就扔在浴缸旁的地板上，上面还放着她的绷带。虽然没看到血迹什么的，但愿她身上的伤已经痊愈——按理说应该如此——只是她那种情况下居然没对我发火，实在反常。

Some time later, as I'm half-dozing, the bathroom door opens. I jerk back awake, glancing around the unfamiliar room briefly before rising. I need to shower too.
过了一会儿，我半睡半醒间，浴室的门开了。我猛地惊醒，环顾了一下陌生的房间，然后起身。我也需要洗个澡。

On reaching the bathroom door I pause with one hand on the handle. "Hey, how was the water holding out? Is there enough for me?"
走到浴室门口，我一手搭在门把上停了下来。“嘿，水还够用吗？我洗的话还有没有？”

"Probably." She's sprawled on a leather sofa in the living room, staring out the broken window. All I can see is the back of her head. At least her hair's back to its normal red.
“应该吧。”她懒散地躺在客厅的皮沙发上，望着破碎的窗外。我只能看到她的后脑勺。至少她的头发恢复了正常的红色。

Shrugging, I step into the bathroom and plant my flashlight on the counter. Asuka's left all of her stuff in here, I note with distaste, including a towel she simply dropped on top of her plugsuit; I kick it all to one side, then strip out of my own ruined clothes and turn on the water.
我耸了耸肩，走进浴室，把手电筒放在洗手台上。注意到明日香把她的东西都留在了这里，包括一条随意扔在她驾驶服上的毛巾；我皱着眉头把它们踢到一边，然后脱下自己破烂的衣服，打开了水龙头。

It's cool, I note as I step into the shower. The pleasant chill of the underground. Of course, it also smells a little like rust and fish, but not like blood, thankfully. I shower quickly, using the soap and shampoo the previous occupants of the house have unwittingly left here for us.
凉爽，我踏进淋浴间时这么想着。地下的这份宜人寒意。当然，也略带些铁锈和鱼腥味，但幸好没有血腥味。我迅速洗了个澡，用着屋子前主人无意中留给我们用的肥皂和洗发水。

In ten minutes or so I step back out into the living room. "Hey, what do you want to do with your plugsuit?" It seems weird just to leave it here, but then there's no reason to carry it around.
大约十分钟后，我重新回到客厅。“嘿，你的战斗服打算怎么处理？”就这样留在这里感觉怪怪的，但又没有理由带着它四处走。

Asuka shrugs, averting her face, staring at the back of the couch. "Whatever. I don't care."
明日香耸了耸肩，转过脸去，盯着沙发的背面。“随便吧。我不在乎。”

Frowning, I study her for a moment, then shuffle around to sit on the floor in front of the couch. She seems okay, but she's still acting funny. The clothes I've gotten for her don't fit perfectly; the jeans are a little too short, and the blue Italian soccer jersey might have been made for a man, but all in all she doesn't look bad. She's still wearing her A10 clips, though. "What's wrong?"
我皱着眉头，打量了她一会儿，然后挪到沙发前的地板上坐下。她看起来还好，但举止依旧有些古怪。我给她找的衣服并不十分合身；牛仔裤稍短了些，那件蓝色意大利足球队服可能是为男性设计的，但总体来说她并不显得难看。她仍戴着 A10 神经连接器。“怎么了？”

She stiffens at the question, hugging arms tightly around her person for some reason. I say nothing, fully intending to wait her out.
她听到问题时身体一僵，不知为何紧紧抱住自己的双臂。我默不作声，打定主意要等她开口。

Eventually she exhales sharply, turning around to stare soberly at me. I can see immediately what has her so worried, but I manage to keep the surprise from my face.
终于，她长长地呼出一口气，转过身来严肃地盯着我。我立刻明白了她的忧虑所在，但我努力不让惊讶显露在脸上。

She's... not scarred, exactly, but marked. Under the bandage that used to be over her eye, she has what looks for all the world like a birthmark. Shaped like a stab wound. It covers her entire left eye and stretches towards her temple, narrowing and disappearing before it reaches her hair. If I took a spear and then somehow stabbed it into her head without killing her, and then let the wound heal for a year, and somehow made the scar tissue smooth like normal skin but pink, it would look just like what she has.
她并非真的有疤痕，而是被标记了。在原本遮住她眼睛的绷带下，她有着一个看起来像是胎记的东西。形状如同刺伤。它覆盖了她整个左眼并向太阳穴延伸，逐渐变细，在触及发际前消失。如果我用长矛刺入她的头部而不致其死亡，然后让伤口愈合一年，并设法使疤痕组织变得像正常皮肤一样光滑但呈粉红色，那就会与她现在的样子无异。

Like a birthmark. 就像一个胎记。

Before I can stop myself I glance down at her right hand, seeing it clench into a fist under my attention. It's marked too, with a straight line starting between her middle knuckles and thinning as it leads partway down her arm.
我还没来得及控制自己，目光已不由自主地落在她的右手上，只见它在我的注视下紧握成拳。那手上也有标记，一条直线从她的中指关节间开始，随着延伸至小臂部分逐渐变细。

Quickly I meet her gaze again, and her eyes narrow angrily, coldly. She's waiting for me to say something, daring me to comment so she can unleash holy hell on me.
我迅速迎上她的目光，她的眼神因愤怒而变得冷冽。她在等我开口，挑衅我评论，好让她有机会对我大发雷霆。

I'm not going to do it. I wouldn't know what to say anyway. I have to think it's something she did to herself, if probably unconsciously, and it's not like it makes her any less pretty.
我不会那么做。况且，我也不知道该说什么好。我猜这痕迹是她自己留下的，尽管可能是不自觉的，但这并不影响她的美丽。

The silence stretches. Leaves rustle and murmur outside.
沉默在蔓延。窗外的树叶沙沙作响，低语着。

"So... what else did you want to do today?" I ask eventually. "You might need better shoes, and I do too. And it wouldn't kill us to get more food, like you said. Apart from that, though... we might have just about everything we need, except for... a tent or something. Or a house."
那么...你今天还想做些什么呢？" 我终于问道。"你可能需要更好的鞋子，我也一样。而且，就像你说的，多准备些食物也无妨。除此之外，我们可能就差...一个帐篷或者类似的东西。或者一栋房子。

A peculiar, frosty expression crosses her face at this, one I can't really read well, but after a moment she gives her head a little shake. "I... don't know," she mutters, flowing to her feet and glancing around, fists clenched. "I don't care. I want to keep moving."
听到这话，她脸上掠过一种奇特而冷淡的表情，我难以完全读懂，但片刻后她轻轻摇了摇头。"我...不知道，"她喃喃自语，站起身来环顾四周，拳头紧握。"我不在乎。我想继续前进。"

"Why?" I ask slowly. "One place is as good as another. Why keep moving?"
为什么？" 我缓缓问道。"一个地方和另一个地方没什么区别。为什么要不停地走？

"I... I don't know. I'll be in the car." Stalking past me without even glancing in my direction, she pushes through the front door, then slams it behind her.
"我...我不知道。我会在车里。" 她从我身边大步走过，甚至没有朝我这边看一眼，推开前门，然后砰地一声关上。

As her sandaled footsteps fade towards the car, I sigh, then turn around and start collecting our few belongings. Her plugsuit and bandages I leave where they lay. I'll do what I can, but I'm not going to bend over backwards to keep her happy.
随着她穿着凉鞋的脚步声向车子远去，我叹了口气，然后转身开始收拾我们寥寥无几的物品。她的插入栓服和绷带我任其留在原处。我会尽力而为，但不会过分迁就以取悦她。

### Chapter 04  Vivace Assai
极活泼的快板

The library is quiet. Quiet and dark; our flashlights don't do much to dispel all the darkness in such a big space. Book titles blur together in front of my eyes; I can't fully read half of them, and those I can read, I'm barely paying attention to.
图书馆内静悄悄的。静谧而昏暗；我们的手电筒在这偌大的空间里也驱不散所有的黑暗。书名在我眼前模糊成一片；我连一半都看不清楚，即便能读到的那些，我也几乎没怎么留意。

Shinji and I haven't spoken much today. It's probably for the best, though, considering my mood. After leaving the house where we showered, I made him drive around until we found a department store to get better clothes, and ones in my size, and made for women. I'm now wearing jeans that fit better, and a tight black shirt with some logo I don't recognize on the chest, something yellow and red. I didn't want to get something that shows off my figure like this, but I couldn't stop myself; my hands were moving independently of my will when they chose what I'm wearing now. I mean, it's not slutty by any means, just tight, but I don't want to draw Shinji's attention to my stomach and chest. Or my attention either, for that matter. I know what's under the shirt.
今天我和真嗣没怎么说话。不过考虑到我的心情，这或许是最好的。离开我们洗澡的那栋房子后，我让他开车四处转，直到找到一家百货公司，买了些合身的衣服，而且是女装。我现在穿着更合身的牛仔裤，以及一件紧身的黑色 T 恤，胸前印着我不认识的标志，黄红相间。我本不想选这种凸显身材的衣服，但就是控制不住自己；挑选身上这套衣服时，我的手仿佛脱离了我的意志。我是说，这绝非轻佻，只是紧身而已，但我不想让真嗣注意到我的腹部和胸部。我自己也不想注意。我知道衬衫下的自己是什么样子。

Surprisingly for Shinji, the flip-flops he got me aren't actually too bad. Pink, and the right size. Still, they weren't practical with all the walking we're going to do, so I made him stop at a shoe store too. We both have hiking shoes now. Maybe a little overkill, but I'd rather that than the alternative, and he didn't seem to care either way.
令真嗣意外的是，他送我的那双人字拖其实还不错。粉色的，尺码也合适。不过考虑到我们即将进行的长途跋涉，它们并不实用，所以我还是让他带我去了一家鞋店。现在我们俩都有了登山鞋。可能有点小题大做，但总比到时候出状况强，而且他似乎对此也无所谓。

Then I made him stop somewhere else to get more batteries. The ones we have are still fine, but I don't want to worry about having a flashlight die in the middle of a shower, or in a dark mall or library. Preparation is key, now.
接着我又让他停下去买了些电池。我们手头的电池还能用，但我可不想在洗澡时或是在昏暗的商场、图书馆里遭遇手电筒突然没电的窘境。现在，做好准备至关重要。

Also surprisingly, what he got for himself isn't lame. It's not really good, but not lame. Jeans with lots of pockets, a grey-and-red Asahi t-shirt.
同样出乎意料的是，他给自己挑的东西并不逊色。算不上特别好，但也不差。一条口袋很多的牛仔裤，一件灰红相间的朝日啤酒 T 恤。

"Hey. How are you coming along?"
嘿，你那边进展如何了？

I blink away my introspection, glancing up, then down the aisle at where Shinji himself is standing with an armful of books. Concern paints his face, and his flashlight, held awkwardly, is illuminating a jauntish portion of the bookshelf next to him.
我眨眼驱散内心的沉思，抬头望去，视线沿着过道落在抱着一摞书的真嗣身上。他的脸上写满担忧，手中笨拙地握着的手电筒，正照亮他身旁书架上一块俏皮的部分。

Closing my eyes momentarily, I turn away, back at the books I'm supposed to be scanning. When he doesn't move, I give my head a little shake. He hovers there a little longer, then disappears somewhere, leaving me alone again.
我闭眼片刻，转过身去，继续处理我本应扫描的书籍。他不动声色，我轻轻摇了摇头。他又在那里徘徊了一会儿，然后不知去向，留下我再次独自一人。

I have to concentrate. I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to. I'd rather find someplace where we can just... sit. Relax.
我必须集中精神。我不想在这里多待一刻。我宁愿找到一个地方，我们可以只是...坐下来。放松一下。

Sighing, I focus on the books in front of me, ignoring those with kanji too complicated to read in the title. I'm supposed to be looking for stuff on nature, on plants and animals; we need to know what we can eat without getting sick, assuming any flora and fauna even remain now, after the end of the world. Shinji's looking for stuff about maintaining cars, about using tools to work wood and such. I don't think either of us know what we're going to need, but I just feel like we're... flailing, or drifting. I hate not knowing things, especially when my life could depend on them. Shinji, on the other hand, didn't even see the need to come here until I mentioned it.
我叹了口气，专注于眼前的书籍，忽略了那些标题中汉字过于复杂的书。我本应寻找关于自然的资料，关于植物和动物；我们需要知道哪些东西吃了不会生病，假设末日之后还有任何动植物存活的话。新二则在寻找关于汽车维护的资料，关于使用工具加工木材等。我不认为我们中的任何一个知道我们将需要什么，但我只是觉得我们像是...在挣扎，或是在漂泊。我讨厌无知，尤其是在我的生命可能取决于它们的时候。而新二，直到我提起，他甚至不觉得有必要来这里。

I... don't have a clue what's in these books. I've been here for ten minutes, doing nothing. Lips peeling back, I choose six at random and stuff them under my arm.
我...完全不知道这些书里有什么。我已经在这里呆了十分钟，什么也没做。我撇了撇干裂的嘴唇，随机挑选了六本，塞在腋下。

It doesn't take long to follow Shinji's light to find him sitting at one of the study tables, a blank computer in front of him and several others nearby. I'd like nothing more than to use one of those things, to look up what I need to know in a fraction of the time it'll take to read these books, but even if everyone else in the world walked out of the sea tonight, that wouldn't happen for quite a while.
不久，我便循着新二的微光找到了他，他正坐在一张学习桌前，面前是一台空白的电脑，周围还有几台。我多么希望能用上其中一台，只需片刻就能查到我需要的信息，而不必费时翻阅这些书籍。但即便今夜全世界的人都从海中走出，这样的好事也还远得很。

He stands up as I emerge from the bookshelves. "Are you ready to go?" Though he meets my gaze directly, his eyes shift minutely to the side before snapping back, exactly as he's done every time we made eye contact since I took the bandage off. He's trying to brush it off, trying to spare my feelings by pretending he doesn't see the scar on my eye, or that it doesn't matter. And for him, maybe it doesn't.
当我从书架间走出来时，他站起身来。“准备走了吗？”尽管他直视我的目光，但他的眼神还是微妙地偏移了一下，然后迅速回正，自从我拆掉绷带后，每次我们目光相交时他都是这样。他试图轻描淡写，试图通过假装没看见我眼上的伤疤，或假装它无关紧要来顾及我的感受。对他来说，也许真的不重要。

He has no idea how bad it is.
他根本不知道情况有多糟。

"Yeah," I answer, dropping my gaze to the floor. I don't like this, but after seeing what I saw this afternoon... it puts everything in a little different light.
“嗯，”我回答道，目光垂向地面。我不喜欢这样，但自从今天下午目睹了那一切之后……一切都似乎有了些许不同的意味。

"Shall we go, then?" he continues. "I'm getting hungry."
那我们走吧？" 他接着说，"我有点饿了。

"I am too. Actually, I want to drive. Gimme the keys." Striding forward, I hold a hand out to him.
"我也是。其实，我想开车。把钥匙给我。" 我大步向前，向他伸出手。

Shinji frowns uncertainly, pulling the key ring from his pocket but simply bouncing it in the palm of his hand. "Are you sure? Are you strong enough?"
真嗣有些不确定地皱起眉头，从口袋里掏出钥匙圈，却只是在手掌中颠来颠去。"你确定吗？你有力气吗？"

I lift an eyebrow and answer by swiping the keys out of his hand. "I'm fine. I was never hurt, just weak." The past day has helped greatly, the food and rest, not to mention a shower and some better shoes. Strangely, even all the walking seems to have helped somewhat.
我挑了挑眉毛，用从他手中夺过钥匙的动作回答。"我没事。我根本没受伤，只是虚弱而已。" 过去的一天帮助很大，食物和休息，更不用说洗了个澡，换了双好点的鞋。奇怪的是，连走路似乎也有些帮助。

He follows as I head out into the blinding daylight of the parking lot. Once outside I pause, squinting, while my eyes get used to the light. "Hey, where'd you put the other backpack?"
他跟着我走向停车场那刺眼的日光中。一到外面，我便停下脚步，眯起眼睛，让眼睛适应光线。“嘿，你把另一个背包放哪儿了？”

"It's in the back seat," answers Shinji. "I'll get it."
“在后座，”真嗣回答道，“我去拿。”

I nod, accompanying him to the car. He's been... helpful, really -- hell, he's done more than I have -- and he hasn't complained at all yet. Unless you count snapping at me once, though it's... possible I... may have deserved it. Anyway, I should go easier on him. I know I should, but moving from thought to deed isn't so easy. Every time I try to start being nicer, he does or says something stupid and I just fall back to normal.
我点头，陪他走向车子。他一直...真的很帮忙——说实在的，他做的比我多——而且他还没抱怨过。除非你把对我吼过一次算上，不过那...可能我...或许也活该。总之，我应该对他好点。我知道我应该，但想法到行动并不容易。每次我想开始对他好点，他就会做些或说些蠢事，我又会回到原点。

The car isn't far -- he parked in a handicapped spot -- and he reaches it before me. Setting his books on the trunk, he opens the back door and leans in, shortly coming out with the backpack we picked up at the department store earlier, an unmarked green thing. Quickly he stuffs the books he's found into it, then takes mine from my arms with an uncertain smile and does the same with them.
车子不远——他停在残疾人车位——他比我先到。把书放在后备箱上，他打开后门，探身进去，很快拿出我们在百货商店买的那个没有标记的绿色背包。他迅速把找到的书塞进去，然后从我怀里接过我的书，带着不确定的微笑，也把它们放了进去。

I watch him work, a little confused. I know he knows I'm preoccupied; he's been nicer since I got out of the shower. But in any case, here's a guy doing work for me that he doesn't have to do, and yet who, less than forty-eight hours ago, was strangling me.
我看着他忙碌，有些困惑。我知道他察觉到我心事重重；自从我洗完澡出来后，他变得更为体贴。但无论如何，眼前这个男人正在为我做他本不必做的事，而就在不到四十八小时前，他还曾试图勒死我。

Once the bag is zipped up, he tosses it back into the car, then smiles again at me, reaching back to thumb an earlobe. Silence stretches.
拉链一拉上，他便将包扔回车里，然后再次对我微笑，伸手用拇指轻触耳垂。沉默在蔓延。

I'm staring, aren't I? Grimacing, I punch him in the shoulder, not too hard, then step past him to the driver's door and open it. The car starts easily, having been properly maintained by all I can tell, and Shinji quickly slides into the passenger seat.
我是在盯着他看吧？我皱了皱眉，轻轻捶了一下他的肩膀，力度适中，随后从他身边走过，打开驾驶座的车门。车子启动得很顺畅，从各方面来看都保养得当，而真嗣也迅速坐进了副驾驶座。

I buckle myself in as I'm backing out of the parking spot. The mirrors are off for me too, I note, but I'll fix them as I drive. Not like there's a lot of other traffic to worry about anyway. "A house?" I suggest.
我系好安全带，同时倒车驶出停车位。我也注意到后视镜的角度不对，但边开边调整吧，反正也没多少其他车辆需要担心。“去个房子？”我提议道。

Shinji nods, staring absently out his window. "I think I might start checking for gas grills," he murmurs as I pull into the street. "It would be nice to cook something real."
真嗣点了点头，目光空洞地望向窗外。“我觉得我可能得开始留意煤气烧烤架了，”他喃喃自语，而我正驶入街道。“能做点真正的食物应该不错。”

As he's speaking, I slam on the gas to see what the car is capable of. Not much, as it turns out, but it does press me pleasantly back against the seat. Shinji claws at the oh-shit handles at the sudden acceleration; he drives like a grandma. "What would you even grill, though?" I wonder. "I'm sure the meat's all rotten now."
他正说着，我猛踩油门，想看看这辆车能有多大能耐。结果并不怎么样，但确实让我舒适地靠在了座椅上。真嗣因突然加速而紧张地抓住了车顶的把手；他开车像个老奶奶。“不过，你会烤什么呢？”我好奇地问。“我敢肯定，现在肉都烂掉了。”

"I don't know," he admits tensely, eyeing the speedometer. "There might be vegetable gardens around, or even animals. Rabbits and stuff." He shrugs uncomfortably. "I don't know. It was just a thought."
“我不知道，”他紧张地承认，眼睛盯着速度表。“周围可能有菜园，甚至还有动物。兔子之类的。”他不安地耸了耸肩。“我也不清楚。只是突然想到而已。”

I can't say I relish the thought of eating rabbit, but it could be worse, and I suppose we can't feast on energy bars and wasabi chips forever. Grunting an acknowledgement, I sail through an intersection and around a half-dozen crashed vehicles. This is nothing like Kaji's old BMW, but it's still fun.
我并不怎么期待吃兔肉，但总比没有好，而且我们总不能永远靠能量棒和芥末薯片过活。我哼了一声表示同意，然后驶过一个十字路口，绕过五六辆撞毁的车辆。这跟加持那辆旧宝马没法比，但依然挺有趣。

As I drive, though, the scar on my right hand catches my eye, on the steering wheel as it is. It looks a lot like a birthmark, but I'm not going to kid myself. It's not one, because it wasn't there when I was born.
当我驾车时，右手上的疤痕不经意间映入眼帘，它正搭在方向盘上。那疤痕酷似胎记，但我不会自欺欺人。它并非胎记，因为出生时它并不存在。

I'm mostly calm now, but I almost cried when I pulled the plugsuit off and saw what I look like now. My whole abdomen, from hips to breasts, is just about entirely pink, save for a few spots of my original pallor where the scars don't happen to overlap. Some, near the edges, have obviously been made by teeth, jagged monster teeth. Some, I still remember getting, as everything was going black, as I was speared to the ground with the sun in my eyes above.
此刻我已大致平静，但当我脱下紧身战斗服，看到自己如今的模样时，几乎泪崩。从髋部到胸部的整个腹部，几乎全被粉红色覆盖，仅存几处原肤色的斑点，那是疤痕未曾交叠的地方。有些疤痕，靠近边缘的，显然是被利齿撕咬而成，那些怪物的锯齿状利齿。有些疤痕，我至今记忆犹新，在一切陷入黑暗之际，在我被钉在地上、阳光刺眼之时。

I'm not an idiot. Now, at least. I know guys like me because I'm hot, and that's about it. But now I'm not. I mean... I know it's superficial to worry so much about it -- freaking out about skin defects that cause no other problems is pretty much the definition of superficial -- but I still feel like someone kicked me in the gut and made off with my wallet. I don't have much to fall back on now; a pretty woman with an attitude is made more interesting, but an ugly woman with an attitude is just a bitch.
我并非傻瓜，至少现在不是。我知道像我这样的女孩之所以吸引男生，仅仅是因为我曾经的美丽。但现在，我已不复从前。我的意思是...我知道过分担忧这些表象问题很肤浅——对不造成其他困扰的皮肤缺陷大惊小怪，这本身就是肤浅的定义——但我仍感觉像是被人猛踹了一脚，还顺走了我的钱包。如今我已无太多资本可依仗；一个有态度的美女或许更引人入胜，但一个有态度的丑女，只会被视为泼妇。

I'm scarred. More scarred even than Misato, more scarred than anyone I've ever seen. And I don't want pity, which is all I'm likely to get for it. If Shinji tries to sugar-coat the one on my face, I'm going to punch him in the crotch. Twice.
我满身伤痕，比美里还要多，比我所见过的任何人都要多。我不需要同情，那是我最可能得到的。如果真嗣试图美化我脸上的那道疤，我会朝他的裤裆狠狠揍两拳。

Realistically, objectively, I know that... that whoever I end up with, eventually, isn't going to care. I mean, I wouldn't end up with him in the first place if he did, and I wouldn't be dr--
从现实和客观的角度来说，我知道……无论最终和谁在一起，他都不会在意。我的意思是，如果他在意，我一开始就不会和他在一起，我也不会……

"Asuka!" 明日香！

Rounding a corner, I blink at the overturned delivery truck in the street ahead, then slam on the brakes. We lurch forward as one, both caught by our seat belts; the car starts to spin, and I do my best to control it.
拐过一个弯，我眨眼间看到前方街道上翻倒的送货卡车，随即猛踩刹车。我们同时向前一冲，都被安全带勒住；车子开始打转，我尽力控制着。

Shinji doesn't make a sound. Neither do I. There is only the screeching of tires.
真嗣没有发出声音。我也是。只有轮胎刺耳的摩擦声。

And then shattering glass. Something punches my face, my chest; the airbag, I suppose. Something hisses, somewhere, steam escaping.
紧接着是玻璃碎裂声。有什么东西击中了我的脸和胸口；我想是安全气囊。某个地方传来嘶嘶声，蒸汽在逃逸。

Lifting my head from the airbag, I blink groggily over it and at the crumpled front end of the car. We hit at an angle, I see; the passenger's side corner took the worst of the damage.
我从安全气囊上抬起头，昏昏沉沉地眨着眼，望向汽车前端那皱巴巴的部分。我们撞得有些偏斜，我看出；乘客侧的角落承受了最严重的损伤。

Passenger. Gasping, I glance at Shinji, but he's alive. He's conscious, gingerly touching his right temple. His fingers come away red with blood; they're shaking, too.
乘客。我喘着气，瞥向真嗣，但他还活着。他清醒着，小心翼翼地触摸自己的右太阳穴。他的手指沾着血，也在颤抖。

"Shinji!" I breathe, touching his shoulder. "How... is it bad? Are you okay?"
真嗣！" 我轻声唤道，轻触他的肩膀。"怎么了...情况很糟吗？你还好吗？

He shakes his head fuzzily, frowning at the blood on his fingers. "I'm... fine," he manages. "Just hit the window, I think."
他迷迷糊糊地摇了摇头，皱眉看着手指上的血迹。"我...没事，" 他勉强说道，"只是撞到窗户了，我想。"

"Let me see." The window past his head, thankfully, hasn't spiderwebbed or broken or anything.
"让我看看。" 他头旁的窗户，谢天谢地，并没有裂成蛛网状或碎裂。

He complies, turning his head towards me. Wide blue eyes watch me warily, measuring my reaction.
他顺从地转过头来面向我。那双湛蓝的大眼睛警惕地注视着我，似乎在衡量我的反应。

Frowning, I lean over towards him, pushing his head around to examine his injury better. It isn't too bad, I don't think, just a blunt impact that happened to split the skin. He'll have a nasty lump for a while, though. "Yeah," I agree. "You are fine. Get out, and we'll bandage you up."
我皱着眉头，俯身靠近他，把他的头转过来以便更好地查看伤口。应该不算太严重，我想，只是钝力撞击恰好划破了皮肤。他可能会肿起一个大包，但问题不大。“嗯，”我同意道，“你没事。出来吧，我们给你包扎一下。”

He nods vaguely, then fumbles for the door handle. I think he's in shock more than he's injured, but in any case he has to kick the door to get it open.
他含糊地点了点头，然后摸索着车门把手。我觉得他更多的是受到了惊吓而非受伤，但无论如何，他还是得用力踢门才能打开它。

As soon as he's out, I do likewise, then retrieve our stuff from the back seat. The crutch, I leave there. I don't really need it anymore.
他一出来，我也跟着下了车，然后从后座取回我们的东西。拐杖，我留在了那里。我现在已经不需要它了。

I find Shinji just standing a few meters from the car, staring blankly at the wreck. I grab his arm and pull him a short distance down the street, just in case a fire starts or some such. Then I direct him to sit down on the curb.
我发现真嗣就站在离车几米远的地方，呆呆地盯着那堆残骸。我抓住他的胳膊，拉着他沿街走了几步，以防万一车子起火或其他什么意外。随后，我让他坐在了路缘石上。

He does so, exhaling heavily, placing his head in his hands, fingers threading through dark hair. "I've never been in an accident before, Asuka," he tells the street.
他照做了，重重地呼出一口气，双手抱头，手指穿过乌黑的头发。“我以前从未出过事故，明日香，”他对着街道说道。

"Let's hope you have the chance to be in another one, some day," I answer absently, digging through one of the backpacks to find the first aid kit I made. My fingers are shaking too, I notice, though not as badly as his were.
“希望有一天你还有机会再经历一次，”我心不在焉地回答，翻找着其中一个背包，寻找我自制的那份急救包。我注意到自己的手指也在颤抖，虽然没有他那么厉害。

In short order I manage to staunch the bleeding -- it wasn't too bad to begin with -- and sterilize the injury. Bandages follow. Shinji just sits there the whole time, staring past me at the other side of the street.
很快，我设法止住了血——本来就不算太严重——并消毒了伤口。接着是包扎。真嗣全程坐在那里，目光越过我，凝视着街道的另一边。

When I'm done, I sit back on my heels and eye him doubtfully. "How do you feel?"
处理完毕后，我跪坐回脚跟上，怀疑地打量着他。“你现在感觉怎么样？”

He blinks, then offers me a self-conscious smile. "Shaky."
他眨了眨眼，然后向我露出一个略带尴尬的微笑。“有点不稳。”

"Dizzy at all?" I continue. "Or can you walk?"
“有没有觉得晕？或者你能走吗？”我接着问。

"I can walk," he assures me. "I doubt I have a concussion, if that's what you're wondering."
“我能走，”他向我保证道，“我想我应该没有脑震荡，如果你担心的是这个的话。”

It was. I shrug. "Whatever. Let's go eat, jerk."
我确实担心这个。我耸了耸肩，“随你便。走吧，去吃点东西，傻瓜。”

He snorts, reaching for the bat and one of the backpacks. I grab the other and loop it over my shoulders as I stand.
他哼了一声，伸手去拿球棒和其中一个背包。我抓起另一个，套在肩上站起身来。

Something stops me, though, something hard on my hip. In my pocket? Reaching in, I pull out the key ring belonging to the car still steaming and dripping fifty meters away. I must have tucked it away without even thinking about it. Chewing a lip, I glance up at Shinji. I suppose we don't need it any more.
但有什么东西阻止了我，是腰间硬硬的感觉。在口袋里吗？伸手进去，我掏出了一串钥匙，属于五十米外仍在冒烟滴水的汽车。我一定是下意识地把它收起来了。我咬着嘴唇，抬头看向慎二。我想我们不再需要它了。

He frowns at the keys, then at me. Then at they keys again.
他皱眉看着钥匙，然后看向我，接着又看向钥匙。

Oh, don't say it, you idiot. Don't say it. I'm not in a very good mood right now, and I'm feeling pretty fucking frazzled too, and if you say it, I swear I'm going to--
哦，别说，你这傻瓜。别开口。我现在心情很糟，感觉也他妈的非常烦躁，如果你说出来，我发誓我会——

"If you don't mind," he sighs eventually, glancing back up at me, "I should... probably drive from now on."
如果你不介意的话，"他最终叹了口气，抬头看向我，"我应该...从现在开始我来开车。

I snarl silently at him, feeling my fingers curl into a fist over the keys. Yes, I get it -- the accident was my fault -- but I just bandaged him up, calmed him down, and all he can do is make fun of my driving skills? "Yeah?" I whisper, tilting my head to one side. "Well, I say, fuck you! Fuck your driving and fuck you!" Screaming, I twist and hurl the keys at the ruined car. They fly too far, clicking and clattering into the pavement a little ways past it.
我无声地对他咆哮，手指紧握成拳，攥着钥匙。是的，我明白——事故是我的错——但我刚刚才给他包扎好，安抚了他，而他却只会嘲笑我的驾驶技术？"是吗？"我低声说，头歪向一边。"那我告诉你，去你的！去你的驾驶技术，还有你！"我尖叫着，转身将钥匙朝那辆破车扔去。它们飞得太远，叮叮当当地落在离车不远的路面上。

Shinji just stares at me, bewildered. I stare back at him, breathing heavily, lips still curled back. Blood rushes in my ears, and my breath is an irregular rasp.
真嗣只是茫然地看着我。我也回瞪着他，呼吸急促，嘴唇依旧紧抿。血液在耳中奔涌，呼吸变得不规律而粗重。

Eventually he just shakes his head and starts walking down the street, away from the accident. The end of the bat drags forgotten on the pavement behind him.
最终，他只是摇了摇头，开始沿着街道走去，远离事故现场。手中的球棒末端被遗忘地拖在路面上。

Exhaling sharply, I stand there for a moment, then give my head a little shake and hurry to catch up with him. As I do, however, my legs give out, depositing me on one knee beside him. Pitching forward, I catch my continuing fall with my hands, but the backpack swings off to one side, almost pulling me over. My hair hangs low enough to brush the rubble-strewn pavement.
我深吸一口气，站在那里片刻，然后轻轻摇了摇头，快步跟上他。然而，就在这时，我的腿一软，让我跪倒在他身旁。我向前倾倒，用手撑住继续下坠的身体，但背包却甩向一边，差点把我拉倒。我的头发低垂，轻拂着满是碎石的路面。

Out of my peripheral vision I can see Shinji stopping to watch me. No helping hand this time, I see. And why would he bother? I wouldn't, in his place, not after that.
从我的余光中，我看到真嗣停下脚步注视着我。这次没有伸出援手，我看到了。他为什么要费心呢？如果我是他，我也不会，尤其是在那之后。

Closing my eyes, I swallow and just... sit there. Sit and breathe. A long moment passes before I feel comfortable pushing myself back up to my feet. My hands sting where little rocks bit into my skin during the fall, and slowly, almost numbly, I brush them clean.
我闭上眼睛，咽了咽口水，就那样...坐在那里。坐着，呼吸。过了好一会儿，我才感觉自己能再次站起身来。我的手在跌倒时被小石子咬伤，刺痛不已，我缓缓地，几乎是麻木地，将它们擦拭干净。

"Where do you want to sleep?" asks Shinji flatly, without looking at me.
"你想在哪里睡觉？" 真嗣平淡地问道，没有看我一眼。

"Anywhere," I answer just as quietly, staring at my hands. "There are... um, houses all over."
哪儿都行," 我同样轻声回答，目光落在自己的手上。"到处都有...嗯，到处都是房子。

"Yeah. We'll just... choose one, then."
嗯。我们就...随便选一个吧。

"Yeah." Without further conversation we continue on down the street. The afternoon sun is low in the west, angling into my eyes, giving me a headache.
"好。" 我们没有再多说什么，继续沿着街道前行。午后阳光斜照在西边，直射进我的眼睛，让我感到一阵头痛。

We crashed between a bank and a hardware store, and it's another two blocks before more houses appear. I was trying to get back to a nice district I saw earlier today, but it's probably a few kilometers away, still. We'll have to settle for something less, something that millions of people in the city went home to every day after work, before.
我们在一家银行和五金店之间着陆，再走两个街区才又见到更多的住宅。我本想回到今天早些时候看到的一个不错的街区，但那儿可能还有几公里远。我们只能将就一下，找个普通的地方，就像这座城市里数百万人在工作结束后每天回家的地方，在一切改变之前。

Shinji angles towards the first house we approach, and I follow him, keeping my eyes on the grass. Near the front steps he drops his backpack and hefts the bat, sizing the place up to decide which window to break.
真嗣朝着我们接近的第一栋房子走去，我跟在他后面，目光紧盯着草地。靠近前门台阶时，他放下背包，举起球棒，打量着房子，决定要砸哪扇窗户。

Out of habit I try the door, and blink when it opens. Turning, I frown back at Shinji, who lowers the bat slightly as he stares past me. Then he gazes over at his backpack for a moment before retrieving it.
出于习惯，我试着推了推门，当门打开时，我眨了眨眼。转过身，我皱眉看向真嗣，他见状稍稍放低了球棒，目光越过我望向屋内。随后，他瞥了一眼自己的背包，又将其拾起。

The inside of the house proves to be more than comfortable despite its modest size. It's extremely well-organized, for one thing, making as much use of the space as possible, and skylights in the kitchen and bathroom make it seem even larger, more airy. Everything is clean, without any photos or anything, and I find myself wondering vaguely who used to live here.
屋内的舒适程度超出了其外观的朴素。首先，它极其井井有条，最大限度地利用了空间，厨房和浴室的采光天窗更让室内显得宽敞而通透。一切干净整洁，没有照片或其他装饰，我不禁好奇这里曾住着谁。

Kicking off his shoes, Shinji drops the food backpack at the end of the sofa. "You still hungry?"
真嗣踢掉鞋子，将装食物的背包扔在沙发尽头。“你还饿吗？”

"Yeah." I tug my own shoes off and make my way to the bathroom. I need to enjoy the running water while it lasts.
"嗯。" 我脱掉自己的鞋子，走向浴室。趁着还有水，我得好好享受一番。

When I come out, Shinji is gnawing on another energy bar. I hold out my hands and he obligingly tosses me one, offering a tired smile along with it.
当我出来时，真嗣又在啃着一根能量棒。我伸出手，他便顺从地扔给我一根，脸上带着疲惫的微笑。

I try to smile back before flopping onto the couch. Sometimes I wonder how long it'll take him to ditch me. I don't think I'd put up with me, were our positions reversed.
我试图回以微笑，然后瘫倒在沙发上。有时候我会想，他到底能忍受我多久。如果换作是我，我可能早就受不了自己了。

After eating, he roots through the bag of books and pulls one out. While sunlight still spills through the windows, he chooses a rectangle of light on the floor, then sprawls out to start reading. He looks like a kid studying.
吃完后，他翻找着那袋书，抽出一本来。趁着阳光还洒满窗户，他在地板上找了一块光亮的地方，然后舒展身体开始阅读。那样子活像个用功的孩子。

Eventually I join him, choosing one of the books on cars. I like driving them, being in them, but not really knowing how they work. I should learn, though, if it'll come in handy. And it will, if we plan to move around much.
最终，我加入了他的行列，挑选了一本关于汽车的书。我喜欢开车，喜欢坐在车里，但对它们的工作原理却知之甚少。我应该学习一下，如果这能派上用场的话。如果我们打算四处走动，这肯定会很有用。

Before I can get more than a few pages in, however, Shinji lifts his head to gaze at me with a thoughtful expression. "Asuka?"
然而，我还没翻过几页，真嗣就抬起头，若有所思地望着我。“明日香？”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"What do you want the rest of your life to look like?" His brows draw together as he ponders the question himself.
“你希望你的余生是什么样的？”他皱起眉头，似乎也在思考这个问题。

I stare back at him briefly, then sigh, shrugging. "I... don't really know," I admit. I've had other worries to occupy me lately. "I guess... I guess I'll wait for everyone to get back, and then... I don't know, go back to Eva. It's what I know best."
我短暂地回望他一眼，然后叹了口气，耸了耸肩。“我……真的不知道，”我承认道。最近我有其他烦心事要操心。“我想……我想我会等大家回来，然后……我也不知道，回伊娃那里去吧。那是我最熟悉的地方。”

He gives me a weird look, then shakes his head. "You really think that?"
他给了我一个奇怪的眼神，然后摇了摇头。“你真的这么想？”

"What?" I snap. "Why? You don't think that's a good idea? I guarantee you they'll try to use them for wars and stuff, once there are enough people for it to be plausible."
“什么？”我急促地反问。“为什么？你不觉得这是个好主意吗？我敢保证，一旦人口足够多，他们就会试图用它们来发动战争之类的。”

"Get real, Asuka," he sighs. "You're never going to sit in an Evangelion again, even if people do come back. Mine is floating in space somewhere, yours is toast and Rei's is totally gone. There were only maybe... four people who understood how they work, and I can pretty much guarantee you three of them won't be coming back. And I doubt Maya will want to help make new ones."
“现实点吧，明日香，”他叹息道。“即使人们回来了，你也永远不会再坐进一台福音战士里了。我的那台不知飘在太空的哪个角落，你的已经报废，而零的那台彻底消失了。大概只有四个人真正懂得它们的工作原理，而我几乎可以肯定其中三个不会再回来。而且我怀疑玛雅会愿意帮忙制造新的。”

I feel my mouth slowly opening as I gaze back at him. He's right. I never really... thought about it like that. In that light, it sort of makes my plans look... silly. "Well, what about you, smartass?" I counter, folding arms angrily over my chest. "What are your great plans?"
我感到自己的嘴巴缓缓张开，回望着他。他是对的。我从未真正...从那个角度考虑过。这样看来，我的计划似乎显得...有些可笑。"那你呢，聪明鬼？"我反问道，气愤地交叉双臂抱在胸前。"你有什么宏伟的计划？"

If my tone upsets him, he shows it not at all. I'm not sure if I like that, how balanced he seems now, how level. He almost never stammers anymore, either. "Well," he breathes, staring up through the window, "I'd thought about maybe studying music. Or... or politics. I kind of want to make sure there's never another NERV. No one should have to go through what we did."
如果我的语气让他不快，他丝毫没有表现出来。我不确定自己是否喜欢他现在的这种平衡感，这种冷静。他几乎不再结巴了。"嗯，"他深吸一口气，透过窗户向上望去，"我曾想过或许可以学习音乐。或者...或者政治。我想要确保不会再有像 NERV 这样的组织。没有人应该经历我们所经历的。"

I chuckle at this. "NERV is what made you what you are," I point out bluntly. His answer's way better than mine. What a jerk. "It's just that... well, you know, I'm so good at everything it's hard to choose what to go into." I try not to flinch as the words are coming out of my mouth. God damn it. This isn't helping me, and he doesn't buy it in any case. It's just... I'm not very good at thinking of this stuff on my feet, and it's easy to try to muddy the waters.
我对此嗤之以鼻。"NERV 塑造了现在的你，"我直截了当地指出。他的回答比我的好多了。真是个混蛋。"只是...你知道的，我样样都擅长，很难决定要专攻什么。"我尽量不让自己的话出口时显得犹豫。该死。这对我没有帮助，而且他显然也不买账。只是...我不擅长即兴思考这些事情，试图混淆视听总是容易些。

His eyes narrow, and slowly he sits upright, folding his book carefully shut without looking at it. "Asuka," he begins in tones of disbelief, "you... didn't learn anything, did you? I mean, you died, and--"
他的眼睛微微眯起，缓缓地坐直身体，不看一眼便小心翼翼地将书合上。“明日香，”他以难以置信的语气开口，“你……什么也没学到，对吧？我是说，你死了，然后——”

"You shut up," I hiss, leaning menacingly towards him. "You have no idea what happened to me, no idea what I went through back there."
“你闭嘴，”我低声怒斥，向他逼近，气势汹汹。“你根本不知道我经历了什么，不知道我在那里遭受了什么。”

"No, I do," he protests, meeting my gaze and holding it. "You told me, remember? You said I knew what happened because I was there."
“不，我知道，”他反驳道，直视我的目光，毫不退缩。“你告诉过我，记得吗？你说我知道发生了什么，因为我在场。”

"Look, I don't know, okay?" I'm yelling now, I realize. "Are you happy? I don't really know what happened. All I know is that you dragged me back here, and then you tried to kill me."
“听着，我不清楚，行了吧？”我意识到自己已经在大声吼叫。“你满意了吗？我真的不知道发生了什么。我只知道你把我拖回这里，然后你试图杀了我。”

He shakes his head forcefully. "I didn't bring you here. I don't think I could have, anyway. Only you know the shape of your personality."
他用力地摇了摇头。“我并没有带你来这里。我想我也做不到，毕竟只有你自己知道你性格的轮廓。”

As he speaks, dreamlike memory swirls to the forefront of my mind, and my eyes widen. He's right. I was fleeing Instrumentality, trying to find something familiar, something comfortable, and then I found something both painful and warm. And it was him. I followed him back to Earth. And then I got here and he was strangling me.
他一开口，梦一般的记忆便涌上心头，我瞪大了眼睛。他是对的。我逃离了工具性，试图寻找熟悉和舒适的东西，然后我找到了既痛苦又温暖的东西。那就是他。我跟随他回到了地球。然后我来到这里，他却试图勒死我。

I can feel a burn starting in my eyes. At first, when I saw him in the dream-kitchen, all I could think about was how disgusting he was, how much I wanted to hurt him... and then he tried to kill me, and I realized how well I'd succeeded. It woke me up, and it shattered me. I was willing to go away just to clean things up between us. For him as much as for me. And now he's sitting here and--
我能感觉到眼眶开始发热。起初，在梦境的厨房里看到他时，我满脑子都是他有多么令人厌恶，我多么想伤害他……然后他试图杀我，我才意识到我做得多么成功。这让我惊醒，也让我崩溃。我愿意离开，只为清理我们之间的纠葛。既是为了他，也是为了我自己。而现在，他就坐在这里——

"Why did you even bother to come back?" His voice is quiet, his eyes strangely cold. I've never seen him look like that before. "You're just going through the motions, trying to do the same stuff all over again. You didn't learn. Why did you come back?"
“你为什么还要回来？”他的声音很轻，眼神异常冷漠。我从未见过他这样。“你只是在走过场，试图重复同样的事情。你没有学到任何东西。你为什么要回来？”

No. I want to tell him, want to explain it, but my throat isn't working. I learned. Mama loves me, and I learned about pain that can fracture hearts forever, and I wanted a chance to do it differently. But now he's staring at me like that, like he's just totally disgusted. There's no respect in his eyes, no fear, just bluntness and disgust. I've never seen that expression directed at me. Never. Especially not from him.
不，我想告诉他，想解释，但我的喉咙不听使唤。我明白了。妈妈爱我，我也体会到了那种能永远撕裂心灵的痛苦，我想要一个不同的机会。但现在他那样盯着我，仿佛完全厌恶我。他的眼里没有尊重，没有恐惧，只有直白和厌恶。我从未见过这样的表情针对我，从未有过。尤其是来自他。

My vision dissolves into a hot blur. Leaping to my feet, I stumble past Shinji and head for the door, remembering only vaguely to grab my shoes. And then I'm gone, out into the street, into the heat, into the city.
我的视线变得模糊而灼热。我猛地站起来，踉跄地绕过真嗣，朝门口走去，隐约记得要抓起鞋子。然后我就离开了，冲到街上，融入热浪，融入这座城市。

Gone.

### Chapter 05 Adagio
柔板

"Asuka, no, wait! Asuka!" Stumbling to the front of the house, I catch the door with one hand as it swings slowly shut, but Asuka is already halfway down the street, even running in socks. She's fast.
"明日香，不，等等！明日香！"我踉跄着冲到屋前，一手抓住缓缓关闭的门，但明日香已经跑到街中央，连鞋都没穿就跑得飞快。她真是敏捷。

Squeezing my eyes shut, I shuffle back to the couch and sink wearily into it. That... that was a mistake. I screwed up. All I wanted to do was talk to her, to put her in a situation where she'd have to answer my questions, or at least address them, without being able to resort to her usual argumentative tactics. It's just so frustrating, though. She hasn't thought about this stuff, not at all. And not through simple oversight, either; I feel like she's actively avoiding trying to think too hard.
我紧闭双眼，拖着沉重的步伐回到沙发，疲惫地坐下。那...那是个错误。我搞砸了。我本只想和她谈谈，让她处于不得不回答我的问题，或至少面对它们，而无法使用她惯用的争辩手段。但实在太令人沮丧了。她根本没考虑过这些，完全没有。并非单纯的疏忽，我感觉她是在刻意回避深入思考。

That's not the worst part, though. It broke my heart, the way she was staring at me, eyes wide and glittering. And not with malice, either, or the usual anger. With tears.
然而，最糟糕的不是这个。她那样盯着我，眼睛睁得大大的，闪着泪光，让我心碎。那不是恶意，也不是平时的愤怒，而是泪水。

I made her cry. I made Asuka cry.
我让她哭了。我让明日香哭了。

My own eyes burn just thinking about it, and shortly I start to sniffle. Hugging knees to my chest, I bury my head in my arms and try to subdue the tears bubbling up inside, but it doesn't help much, and in short order lines of warmth are spilling down my cheeks.
一想到这事，我的眼睛就灼热起来，不久便开始抽泣。我抱紧双膝，将头埋进臂弯，试图压抑住内心涌动的泪水，但效果甚微，很快，温热的泪痕便顺着脸颊流淌下来。

How did this even happen? How did she let me hurt her like that? I'm astonished she gives my words enough weight to let them have such an affect on her. Maybe something else is messing with her head right now. The birthmarks, maybe? Is she that worried about a little discoloration? I don't know. I don't get it.
这一切究竟是怎么发生的？她怎么会让我如此伤害她？我惊讶于她竟如此看重我的话，以至于它们能对她产生如此影响。或许她此刻正被其他事情困扰着。是那些胎记吗？她真的那么在意那点色斑吗？我不知道，我无法理解。

Some time later, I scrub the back of a hand against my face and stand, blankly examining the living room of our borrowed house. The neatness of the original arrangement is somewhat sullied by the books we have spread all around, and the energy bar wrapper that Asuka never threw away. After a moment I sigh, then sprawl back on the floor.
过了一会儿，我用手背擦了擦脸，站起身来，茫然地审视着我们借住的房子里的客厅。原本整洁的布置因我们散落一地的书籍和明日香未曾丢弃的能量棒包装纸而略显凌乱。片刻后，我叹了口气，又瘫倒在地。

Time passes. I try to read, but never turn a page, and I don't remember any of the text.
时间流逝。我尝试阅读，却始终未翻一页，也记不住任何文字。

Once it gets dark I opt to retire rather than use battery power to keep failing to read. I don't really feel comfortable sleeping in someone else's bed, so I do the next best thing: I lift a blanket and a pillow from a linen closet, then spread them out on the living room floor after pushing our stuff out of the way. Once curled up on my side, I find my eyes staring at the wrapper Asuka left, a collection of glittering vertices in the weak moonlight. She was touching that, not long ago. She ate from that.
天一黑，我便选择就寝，而非耗费电池继续徒劳地阅读。睡在别人的床上总让我感到不自在，于是我采取了次优方案：从布草间拿了一床毯子和一个枕头，将我们的物品挪开后，在客厅地板上铺开。蜷缩侧躺后，我的目光不由自主地落在明日香留下的包装纸上，它在微弱的月光下闪烁着点点光芒。不久前，她还触碰过它，还从中取食。

I close my eyes. It takes a long time to fall asleep.
我闭上双眼，却久久难以入眠。

The next day, after a quick shower, I redo the bandage over my temple. It's not too bad of an injury, except it hurts like hell to touch, but somehow I managed to get blood on my shirt yesterday. I'll have to get a new one, I suppose. Shouldn't be too hard.
次日，匆匆洗了个澡后，我重新包扎了太阳穴上的伤口。伤势不算严重，只是触碰时痛得要命，但昨天不知怎的竟让血迹沾到了衬衫上。看来得换件新的了，应该不难找到。

For breakfast I feast on stale cereal I scrounged from the kitchen, with lemon sports drink in place of milk. Our food supply is running thin, and I'm pretty tired of all that stuff now anyway.
早餐我吃的是从厨房搜罗来的陈旧麦片，用柠檬味运动饮料代替牛奶。我们的食物储备日渐减少，而且我对这些玩意儿也实在是吃腻了。

The day passes in a blur of inactivity. I end up alternating between reading, scrounging and simply lying on the half-dead grass in the front lawn, staring at the sky. The clouds, I note, are... pinkish. The whole time, I'm waiting for Asuka, but there's no sign of her. I might as well be alone in the world. Maybe I will be, from now on.
日子在一片无所事事中匆匆流逝。我时而读书，时而四处搜寻，时而干脆躺在门前的半枯草地上，凝望天空。我注意到，那些云朵竟泛着淡淡的粉红色。整个过程中，我都在等待明日香，但她始终没有出现。我仿佛被世界遗弃，或许从今往后，我注定孤独。

I don't want to leave. She was here with me. I have to go, though, have to move.
我不想离开，她曾与我同在。然而，我必须走，必须前行。

When the next morning rolls around, I find pen and paper, then leave a note for Asuka on the front door of the house despite my serious doubts she'll ever bother to come back and see it. In it I explain that I'm moving locations, and that somehow I'll let her know where I end up. Part of me wants to stay at the house just to be sure she can find me, but I can't stay there forever. It's starting to feel... confining, and not a little creepy, to live alone in somebody else's place, and in any case I feel like it's somehow pinning me into my current situation.
次日清晨，我找来纸笔，尽管深知明日香可能再也不会回来看到，还是在前门上给她留了张便条。我在便条中告诉她我将搬往别处，并承诺会设法让她知道我的去向。内心的一部分渴望留在屋里，只为确保她能找到我，但我不能永远待在这里。这地方开始让我感到压抑，甚至有些阴森，独自住在别人的房子里，总感觉自己被困在了现状中。

Then, with morning sunlight in my eyes, I wheel out the bicycle I found in back of the house and start biking. The breeze of my velocity feels good on my face.
随后，迎着晨光，我推出在后院找到的自行车，开始骑行。风速带来的微风拂面，感觉甚是惬意。

In minutes I reach one of the many strip malls in this portion of the city, and there I spend a few hours gathering what I need and can carry easily with me. After leaving the note I decide it's reasonable to bring a little notebook around, and I combine several water bottles into one bigger hard-plastic container. But perhaps the most valuable resource I find is information, in the form of a beat-up old phone directory for the city, as well as a detailed map to let me find the locations mentioned therein.
几分钟内，我便抵达了城市这一区域众多商业街中的一条，在那里我花了几个小时收集所需物品，并确保它们便于携带。留下字条后，我决定随身携带一本小笔记本是合理的，并将几瓶水合并到一个更大的硬塑料容器中。但或许最有价值的资源是信息，我找到了一本破旧的城市电话簿和一张详细的地图，以便我能找到上面提到的地点。

It turns out the nearest outdoors store is only a few kilometers away, so I set off biking towards it, grimacing at the effort of ascending the hills in the intervening space. The map is tucked into my pocket; I anticipate using it pretty often, now.
原来最近的户外用品店仅几公里之遥，于是我骑上自行车朝那里进发，途中爬坡时因用力而皱眉。地图已塞进口袋；我想现在会经常用到它了。

My ride to the store turns out to take longer than expected, due to a bridge that's nothing but rubble and dust, but by midday I reach my destination. And then I actually grin at all the useful stuff there.
前往商店的路程比预期要长，因为一座桥已化为瓦砾和尘埃，但正午时分我终于到达目的地。看到那里琳琅满目的实用物品，我不禁露出了笑容。

Quickly I've combined two backpacks into one made for hiking or something. I also, after brief consideration, lift a better bike, then find some bags that can be tied onto it. Other goods find their way into the new backpack, a sheet of tarp, a blanket, a hunting knife, a flare gun and several flares. Two pairs of walkie-talkies, each with a twenty-kilometer range, and a pile of batteries to power them. A GPS unit, which, to my surprise, still works; I suppose the satellites weren't affected at all. A little propane heater to boil water with.
我迅速将两个背包合并成一个适合徒步或其他用途的。经过短暂考虑，我又挑选了一辆更好的自行车，并找到了可以绑在上面的几个袋子。其他物品也陆续装进了新背包，包括一张防水布、一条毯子、一把狩猎刀、一支信号枪和几枚信号弹。两对对讲机，每对通信范围达二十公里，还有一堆电池为其供电。一个 GPS 设备，令我惊讶的是它居然还能用；看来卫星丝毫未受影响。一个小型丙烷加热器，用来烧水。

A couple hours later I finally leave the store, grimacing under the weight of the new backpack. My legs are still tired from before, but it doesn't take me long to get back to the house. Once there, I leave one of the walkie-talkies there with Asuka's name taped to it. If I can think of another place she's likely to return to, I'll leave one of the other pair there, too. The beach, maybe. Not today, though.
几个小时后，我终于离开了商店，背着沉甸甸的新背包，脸上露出痛苦的表情。双腿依旧疲惫，但不久便回到了家中。一到家，我便将对讲机中的一台留在那里，上面贴着写着“明日香”名字的标签。如果我能想到另一个她可能返回的地方，我也会在那里留下另一对对讲机中的一台。或许是海滩。但不是今天。

From there I begin the long task of biking up Irie Road and out of the city. It's all uphill, and winding; soon my legs are on fire, and my throat feels like sandpaper. Frequent breaks don't help, but at least they prevent it from getting worse.
从那里开始，我踏上了骑车沿 Irie 路出城的漫长旅程。一路都是上坡，蜿蜒曲折；不久，我的双腿如火焚烧，喉咙干涩得像砂纸。频繁的休息无济于事，但至少能防止情况恶化。

As they day wears on, the endless line of JSSDF military hardware along the sea-facing side of the road turns from something uncomfortable into something merely boring. The wind picks up during the afternoon, and with it come some heavier clouds, looking almost purple.
随着时间推移，沿路面向大海一侧绵延不绝的日本自卫队军事装备，从最初的不适逐渐变得乏味。午后风势增强，随之而来的是更浓重的云层，近乎紫色的深沉。

When the city grows sparse, giving way to mostly trees, it starts to rain. It confuses me at first, watching the droplets leave pinkish wet spots on my shirt, and then it hits me.
当城市变得稀疏，树木成为主宰时，雨开始下了。起初，我困惑地看着雨滴在我衬衫上留下粉红色的湿痕，随后恍然大悟。

It's raining LCL. Raining blood. People.
这是 LCL 雨。血雨。人雨。

Abruptly my stomach heaves, and I fall off the bike, shaking. Somehow I manage to crawl a few meters away before vomiting into the scrub along the edge of the road. With the smell of the stuff falling from the sky, I can't help but think of entry plugs, of pain and fighting and Rei and Asuka. Misato. It's stuff I haven't thought of much lately, my worries having concerned the present and future, but the LCL rain drives it all right back home. Watching Rei blow herself up. Seeing the half-skeletonized remains of Unit-02, with Asuka long since gone silent on the channels.
突然间，我的胃一阵翻腾，我从自行车上摔了下来，浑身颤抖。不知怎的，我爬了几米远，在路边灌木丛中呕吐起来。闻着从天而降的这股气味，我不禁想起了插入栓，想起了痛苦、战斗、还有绫波和明日香。还有美里。这些我最近已经很少想起的事情，在这 LCL 雨的冲刷下，全都涌上了心头。看着绫波自爆的场景。望着半骷髅化的二号机残骸，明日香早已在通讯中沉默许久。

Eventually I subside to mere ragged coughing, wiping my mouth clean as red rain patters steadily into the cracked pavement all around me. I... I wish she hadn't gone.
最终，我止住了呕吐，只剩下断断续续的咳嗽，擦干净嘴角，红色的雨滴不断落在龟裂的路面上。我……真希望她没有离开。

Long moments later I push myself back to my feet. On trembling legs I make it back to the bike, and with a monumental effort I start riding again. The wound in my head throbs with every heartbeat. I just... just want to be done. To get somewhere and sit.
许久之后，我挣扎着站起身来。双腿颤抖着，我回到自行车旁，费尽全力再次骑上。头部的伤口随着每一次心跳而抽痛。我只想……只想结束这一切。找个地方坐下来。

As the ascent continues, I lose track of time in a haze of pain, but eventually I spot a clearing close to the road. Turning the bike that way, I wobble over and shortly slide off it to the ground. A few dozen more steps take me to the edge of the clearing, and there I collapse.
随着攀登的继续，我在疼痛的迷雾中失去了时间的概念，但最终我注意到路边有一片空地。我摇摇晃晃地将自行车转向那里，不久便从车上滑落到地面。再走几十步，我来到了空地的边缘，随即瘫倒在地。

Rain continues to hiss into the world, turning dirt into mud, soaking my clothes, but I find I'm not paying much attention to it. Instead I'm staring off over... a ridge, I guess, between pine trees, towards the city below. Precipitation fuzzes the view of more distant features, but it's not raining all that hard, so I can see most of the ruined metropolis, including the giant hole in the middle where the GeoFront -- the Black Moon -- used to be. Nothing's moving down there. Nothing at all, apart from the rain.
雨继续嘶嘶地落入这个世界，将泥土化为泥泞，浸湿了我的衣物，但我发现自己并没有太在意这些。相反，我凝视着远处......我想是松树间的一道山脊，望向下方城市。雨水模糊了更远处的景象，但雨势并不算大，所以我还能看到大部分废墟般的大都市，包括中央那个巨大的洞——曾经是 GeoFront，即黑月所在的地方。那里没有任何东西在动。除了雨，什么都没有。

Tokyo-3 is nothing but a crumbling mausoleum. It's time to move on.
第三新东京市不过是一座摇摇欲坠的陵墓。是时候离开了。

Maybe an hour later, the rain starts to let up and I push myself back to my feet. It doesn't take long to set up a camp of sorts, little more than the tarp spread along muddy ground and my blankets above it. Dinner consists of crackers and fake spray-cheese, washed down with water.
大约一个小时后，雨势开始减弱，我挣扎着站起身来。搭建一个简陋的营地并不费时，只是在泥泞的地面上铺开防水布，再在上面铺上我的毯子。晚餐是饼干和假喷雾奶酪，用水送下。

Once it's dusk, nearing dark, I rummage through the backpack to find my flare gun, a cool-looking thing with basically just a tube and a trigger. After fitting a flare into it, I close my eyes and fire it straight up. Like a radiant point of orange starlight it soars up, then flutters downward for a time before winking out.
每当暮色四合，夜幕将至，我便翻找背包，寻出那把造型酷炫的信号枪，其实不过是一根管子和一个扳机。装上信号弹后，我闭上眼，直直朝天开火。它如同一颗璀璨的橙色星光冲天而起，随后飘摇下落，直至熄灭。

Asuka knows where I am now. I wonder how she's doing.
明日香现在知道我在哪儿了。不知她近况如何。

The next day I awake bored, and stay bored all day. My legs are still sore and tired from the ride up here yesterday, so I don't move around much. Instead I read what I can, though I don't manage to learn anything useful, and when I'm not reading I'm just sitting around, enjoying the calm.
次日醒来，我百无聊赖，整日如此。昨日骑行至此，双腿仍感酸痛疲惫，故而少有走动。我尽量阅读，却未学到什么实用之物，不读书时，便静坐一旁，享受这份宁静。

It... really, it is nice here. Pretty and quiet.
这里……确实，很美，很宁静。

Some music wouldn't kill me, though. I think, apart from all the people I know, music is the thing I miss the most.
有些音乐倒不至于要了我的命。我想，除了我认识的所有人之外，我最怀念的就是音乐了。

That night I shoot another flare into the sky. I suspect she knows where I am, but I have to make sure.
那晚我又向天空发射了一枚信号弹。我怀疑她知道我在哪儿，但我必须确认一下。

The next day my food is just about gone, so I grab the bike again and brave my way back down the hill into the city. Though, obviously, the ride down isn't bad at all, but it does get me to wondering how well the brake pads will hold up if I try to go as slow as I want to.
第二天我的食物几乎耗尽，于是再次骑上自行车，勇敢地沿着山坡返回城市。当然，下坡骑行并不糟糕，但我确实开始担心，如果我想骑得尽可能慢，刹车片能否承受得住。

Once into the remaining suburbs of Tokyo-3, I navigate my way through rubble and barren streets to one of the stores I saved in the GPS unit. Before I get there, however, I see something that catches my interest, and I slow down, frowning.
一进入东京-3 区残存的郊区，我便在废墟和荒凉的街道中穿行，前往我在 GPS 设备中保存的一家商店。然而，在到达之前，我看到了一些引起我兴趣的东西，于是我放慢速度，皱起了眉头。

Asuka's name has been spraypainted across an intersection in vivid crimson. After the last character it descends into a meandering sequence of loops and curls stretching down one street. Eventually the paint makes its way over to the sidewalk, and then to the side of an apartment building, as though she were just spraying whatever she happened to walk past without paying attention to what it was. Maybe half a block away, I can see something silver and metallic on the ground, where the paint ends. She must have run out and then dropped it.
明日香的名字被用鲜亮的猩红喷漆横跨一个十字路口。在最后一个字符后，它变成了一串蜿蜒的圈环和卷曲，沿着一条街道延伸下去。最终，喷漆蔓延到了人行道上，然后到了一栋公寓楼的侧面，仿佛她只是随意地喷涂着经过的任何东西，而不在意那是什么。大约半条街开外，我能看到地面上有些银色金属的东西，那里是喷漆的尽头。她一定是用完了，然后把它扔了。

Squeezing the brakes more firmly, I stop the bike over one of the mindless curves, then squat on my heels and touch the ground. It's not wet. How long ago did she do this? I have to assume at least an hour. Maybe a day or more.
我更用力地捏紧刹车，让自行车停在其中一个无意义的曲线之上，然后蹲下身，用脚跟触地。地面并不湿。她这是多久前做的？我得假设至少一个小时。也许一天甚至更久。

Straightening, I cup hands to my mouth and yell down the way of the paint can. "Asuka? Are you here?" My voice echoes back to me, fractured by the hard angles of the city.
站起身，我将双手拢在嘴边，朝着喷漆罐的方向喊道：“明日香？你在这里吗？”我的声音在城市的坚硬棱角间回荡，支离破碎。

Sighing, I get back on the bike and frown at the ground a moment longer. Then I kick into motion and continue on my way.
叹了口气，我重新骑上自行车，对着地面皱眉片刻。随后，我用力一蹬，继续前行。

Six blocks later, though, I stop again. Her name has been sprayed dozens of times across the cracked exterior wall of a laundromat, in all manner of sizes, shapes and styles, all red. And then, in the middle of it all, in black Roman characters so small they're almost too messy to read, my own name with a question mark after it. Shinji? Runners of paint, long since dry, trickle down from it like black blood.
六条街之后，我又一次停下脚步。她的名字被喷涂了数十次在一家洗衣店破损的外墙上，大小、形状和风格各异，全是红色。而在这一切之中，用黑色罗马字母写得极小，几乎难以辨认，是我的名字后面跟着一个问号。真嗣？干涸已久的油漆痕迹从字迹上流淌下来，宛如黑色的血液。

What... is this? A message? Did she expect me to come this way? Or is this just her venting some crazy Asuka stuff from her head, the vandalistic equivalent of muttering? Does it mean anything?
这...是什么？一条信息吗？她预料到我会走这条路吗？还是这只是她从脑海中发泄出的疯狂明日香式的行为，相当于自言自语的破坏性等价物？这有意义吗？

Stepping back, I glance both ways down the street, but there's nothing else in sight, no other graffiti. If this is random, how many other places must she have done it for me to have found two already? Maybe it's not random.
我后退一步，向街道两头张望，但视线所及再无其他涂鸦。如果这是随机的，那她得在多少其他地方也这么做，我才能已经发现两处？也许这不是随机的。

Shinji? 真嗣？

Something starts to... feel weird, inside. Hollow. I miss her.
内心开始...感觉有些异样，空落落的。我想她了。

Was she right? I've been wondering, from time to time. Did I need her help specifically, or anyone's, and she happened to be the closest person to ask? Misato could have helped me, probably. Hell, she even tried to, but I closed her out. And then asked Asuka, who cut my heart in half.
她是对的吗？我时不时会这么想。我是真的需要她的帮助，还是任何人的都行，而她恰好是离我最近的人？美里或许也能帮我，大概吧。她甚至尝试过，但我拒她于千里之外。然后我向明日香求助，结果她把我的心撕成了两半。

Shinji? 真嗣？

A long time passes before I shuffle back and get on the bike again. I see no more graffiti on the way to the store.
过了许久，我才拖着步子回到自行车旁，再次骑上去。去商店的路上，我再也没看到任何涂鸦。

Once I get there, I pull the flashlight out and use it to smash my way through the glass doors, and only then employ it as its makers intended. It seems weird to walk around in a grocery store when most of the goods inside are well past the point of spoiling -- the rotten stench tells me that much, easily -- but there are valuable things here I'm not likely to find anywhere else.
一到那里，我就掏出手电筒，用它砸碎玻璃门，之后才按其设计初衷使用。在一家超市里徘徊，里面的商品大多已腐败变质——那股腐烂的恶臭轻易地告诉我这一点——这感觉颇为诡异，但这里有些东西我很难在别处找到。

Pulling my shirt up to cover my face, I wander inside, playing the light over shelves of inane goods likely never to see the light of day again. Novelty gums and candies with gaudy packaging, promising mind-blowing flavor. Glossy magazines near the checkouts, offering tips on how to please men or lose a few kilos. Dried and wilted bouquets for penitent boyfriends too lazy to go to a florist. This place is a graveyard for all the innocent but totally unnecessary elements of our culture. Lemon sours sold in bulk? I'd consider killing for a glass of milk, for a pear.
我拉起衬衫遮住脸，漫步其中，用手电筒扫过货架上那些可能再也不会见天日的无聊商品。花哨包装的新奇口香糖和糖果，承诺着令人震撼的味道。收银台附近的时尚杂志，提供取悦男人或减肥的小贴士。干枯萎蔫的花束，是懒得去花店的悔过男友所赠。这个地方，是我们文化中那些无辜却完全不必要元素的墓地。成批出售的柠檬酸糖？我甚至愿意为一杯牛奶、一个梨子去杀人。

Holding my breath and moving quickly, I ignore the produce and meat sections, instead heading towards stuff that'll last a while. Noodles. Rice. Canned fruits and vegetables... and an actual can opener, after brief reflection. A pot, and some utensils. With my propane heater, I can boil water and thus have a semi-decent array of choices open to me.
屏住呼吸，迅速行动，我忽略了蔬菜和肉类区，直奔那些能存放较久的食品。面条、大米、罐头水果和蔬菜……还有一把实实在在的开罐器，经过短暂思索后决定拿上。一口锅，几件餐具。有了便携式燃气炉，我就能烧水，这样一来，我的选择范围也算半斤八两了。

I wonder how Asuka's doing. I wonder what she's found to eat.
不知道明日香怎么样了。她找到了什么吃的呢？

Not long after entering the store, I leave it again. Once outside I smile and breathe deeply of the relatively-fresh air of empty Tokyo-3.
进店不久，我又匆匆离开。一出店门，我便微笑着深吸一口东京 3 区空荡荡的相对清新的空气。

On the way out of the city, I pass the laundromat wall again, and the giant signature in the intersection. I don't stop for either.
在离开城市的路上，我又经过了那家洗衣店的墙和路口的巨大签名。这两处我都没有停留。

The ride back up Irie Road seems easier this time. Either I just have less stuff, or I'm getting to be in better shape. I suppose both are possible; I doubt I've ever been as fit as I am now. Maybe there's an upside to living in an uncivilized world.
这次沿着艾瑞路返回似乎轻松了许多。要么是我东西少了，要么是我身体状况更好了。我想两者皆有可能；我怀疑自己从未像现在这样健康过。或许在这个未开化的世界里，也有其积极的一面。

It's just getting to be dusk when I reach my makeshift campsite atop the ridge. In Misato's honor, as my first hot meal I cook instant curry, and smile as I eat it, though the expression is partially a bitter one. She was so grown up all the time; she knew exactly what she was doing. Except with Kaji, I guess. Anyway, she deserved better than to have to have to drag me around NERV on the day of Third Impact. I... hope she comes back, some day. I need to apologize.
当我抵达山脊上的临时营地时，天色刚转暗。为了纪念美里，我做的第一顿热饭是速食咖喱，吃的时候我笑了，尽管这笑容带着几分苦涩。她总是那么成熟，知道自己要做什么。除了对加持，我想。无论如何，她本不该在第三次冲击那天拖着我在 NERV 四处奔波。我……希望她有一天能回来。我需要道歉。

Once I'm done eating, a little bottled water serves to rinse my pot clean. I chuckle a little at that; with everything that's happened, I still get stuck doing dishes. Another flare soars heavenward, twinkling and shining for its brief life. Yes, Asuka. I'm here.
吃完饭后，我用一点瓶装水把锅冲洗干净。想到这，我不禁轻笑；尽管发生了那么多事，我依旧得洗碗。又一枚信号弹升空，在它短暂的生命中闪烁发光。是的，明日香，我在这里。

Threading fingers behind my head, I lie back on my tarp and stare at the stars and moon above. My mom is up there somewhere, in Unit-01, floating forever. "What else is up there?" I murmur. "With you? No more Angels, I guess. I hope you don't get too lonely. I'll be thinking about you, if it helps."
我将手指交缠在脑后，仰躺在防水布上，凝望着头顶的星辰与月亮。我的母亲就在那上面，在 Unit-01 里，永远地漂浮着。“那里还有什么呢？”我喃喃自语，“和你一起的？我想，应该没有更多的使徒了吧。希望你不会感到太孤单。如果这能有所帮助的话，我会一直想着你的。”

Silence answers me, nothing but wind breathing through leaves and pine needles all around. "It's lonely down here, too," I continue, letting my eyes slide shut. In my mind's eye I see a face staring back at me, but it's not my mother's. "She's lonely too. If she even gets lonely. Does she? I... don't really know."
寂静回应着我，四周只有风穿过树叶和松针的呼吸声。“这里也很寂寞，”我继续说着，闭上了眼睛。在心灵的视野中，我看到一张脸回望着我，但那不是我母亲的。“她也很孤单。如果她真的会感到孤单的话。她会吗？我……真的不知道。”

I'm talking to myself. At first I try to suppress the laughter that results from this, but who's around to judge me? I'm here, alone, and it's funny. I laugh until my voice echoes back to me from the mountains all around.
我正在自言自语。起初我试图抑制由此引发的笑声，但又有谁会来评判我呢？我独自一人在这里，这本身就是件好笑的事。我笑到声音在周围的山峦间回荡。

### Chapter 06 Presto Agitato
急板激昂

As I shake the last few drops of gasoline out of the can in my hands, I can't help but wonder exactly what I'm doing, and why. Certainly there's no survival-related reason to be doing this, but I could just as easily claw my eyes out as stop. Still, why worry? It'll be fun.
当我将手中的油桶里最后几滴汽油抖落时，不禁疑惑自己究竟在做什么，又是为何。显然，这并非出于生存所需，但我却宁愿挖出自己的双眼也不愿停下。不过，何必烦恼呢？这会很有趣。

When I'm satisfied the canister is empty, I toss it carelessly aside. From my pocket I draw a book of matches, a gem of a find from some crappy suburban hotel. One stick flares to life, then drops silently to the street. I scamper a few steps backward.
确认油桶已空后，我随意地将其抛至一旁。从口袋里掏出一本火柴，那是从某个破败郊区酒店中意外得来的宝贝。一根火柴燃起，随即无声地落向街道。我急忙后退几步。

The gas ignites with a dull whoosh, roaring into an instant blaze and tracing out the lines of the characters I've poured onto the ground. Dry heat embraces me, fills my vision. In a second the parking lot is ablaze, radiating my name in fiery katakana at the sky, at everything.
汽油轰然点燃，发出沉闷的呼啸声，瞬间化作熊熊烈焰，勾勒出我倾倒在地面上的字符轮廓。干燥的热浪将我包围，充斥着我的视野。转眼间，停车场陷入火海，用炽热的片假名向天空、向一切放射出我的名字。

As it burns, I find my eyes drawn to the tree-studded ridge where Shinji lives. It's dark now, and I can barely make the spot out, but I'll bet he can see this. Idly I think back to a college lecture, over a year ago, in which the instructor was relating the story from what I'd now call the childhood of the astrobiology field. Telescopes had just gotten good enough to see some of the surface of Mars, and a sizeable number of scientists were convinced that men were living there, brothers in our own solar system. Spectacular and harebrained plans to communicate were spawned, debated and discarded, perhaps the most memorable of which being the idea of carving enormous trenches into the Saharan Desert, a half-kilometer wide and thirty long. They'd be filled with water, and then kerosene poured atop the water and set on fire. The resulting message would burn so brightly and so epically as to be visible across space, legible to an alien on Mars with a semi-decent telescope.
火焰燃烧之际，我的目光不由自主地被吸引到植被点缀的山脊，那里是真嗣的住处。夜色已深，我几乎辨认不出那个位置，但我敢打赌，他能看到这一幕。我漫不经心地回想起一年多前的一堂大学讲座，讲师正在讲述我如今称之为天体生物学领域的早期故事。那时，望远镜刚发展到足以窥见火星表面，不少科学家坚信那里居住着人类，是我们太阳系中的兄弟。由此催生了一系列壮观而疯狂的沟通计划，它们被提出、辩论，最终又被抛弃，其中最令人难忘的莫过于在撒哈拉沙漠中挖掘巨大壕沟的构想——宽达半公里，长达三十公里。这些壕沟将注满水，再于水面之上倾倒煤油并点燃。由此产生的信息将燃烧得如此明亮、如此壮丽，以至于在太空中清晰可见，即使是火星上拥有半好望远镜的外星人也能读懂。

That's us, Shinji. You're the Martians, and I'm Gauss, or Littrow, or whoever the hell it was. How ya doin?
那就是我们，真嗣。你们是火星人，而我则是高斯，或是利特罗，管他是谁呢。你过得怎么样？

Giggling, I tuck the matchbook back into my pocket and start running through the streets. Running and screaming. I don't have a baseball bat but I do have a crowbar, and I smash it into every window I pass, leaving a glittering trail of diamondlike glass in the wake of my passage.
我咯咯笑着，把火柴盒塞回口袋，开始在街道上奔跑。边跑边尖叫。虽然没有棒球棒，但我有一根撬棍，我挥舞着它砸碎沿途的每一扇窗户，留下一串串钻石般闪耀的玻璃碎片，随着我的经过而洒落。

I don't need him. This is just for fun.
我不需要他。这只是为了好玩。

In moments I reach the bottom of my new home, a blocky apartment building atop a low hill. Hopping onto a dumpster I moved earlier, I leap to catch the fire escape ladder. The palm of my right hand is stiff as I climb; the paint on it still hasn't come off yet. I wonder how much spraypainting I really did. I didn't even realize I was doing it until a couple of days ago.
转眼间，我来到了新家的底部，一座位于小山丘上的方正公寓楼。我跳上之前挪动的垃圾桶，一跃抓住消防梯的扶手。右手掌因涂了油漆而僵硬，油漆还没完全脱落。我不禁思索自己到底喷了多少漆。直到几天前，我甚至没意识到自己在这么做。

Quickly the ladder brings me to metallic stairs, which I run up as fast as I can, angling back and forth across the wall of the apartment with every switchback as I ascend. After five stories I climb onto the handrail, then jump to catch the lip of the roof and pull myself up.
梯子很快将我带到金属楼梯，我尽可能快地向上奔跑，在每个转弯处都斜穿过公寓楼的墙面。爬了五层楼后，我踏上栏杆，然后跳起抓住屋顶边缘，用力将自己拉上去。

My home is still as I left it, a collection of blanketed peaks organized around the back of one of those exhaust vents that seem to be on top of every building around. Dropping my crowbar to the rooftop, I duck under a hanging blanket edge and curl up against the dull metal of the vent. I'm sweating, and still smiling, though I blank my face the moment I realize it.
我的家依旧如我离去时那般，是一片被毯子覆盖的山峰，围绕着其中一个似乎每栋建筑顶上都有的排气口排列。我将撬棍丢在屋顶上，低头钻过悬挂的毯子边缘，蜷缩在排气口那沉闷的金属旁。我汗流浃背，脸上仍挂着微笑，但意识到这一点时立刻收敛了表情。

This is my home. No one can hurt me here.
这里是我的家。没有人能在这里伤害我。

As I sit, my eyes drift through the near-darkness to all my other things, arranged with precision and care. A coil of hemp rope. Water. A knife. Two traffic cones, stacked together. Another container of gasoline. A walkie-talkie with a note on it. I've even got a sword I found from some guy's house.
我坐下时，目光在昏暗中游走，扫过我精心摆放的所有物品。一卷麻绳。水。一把刀。两个叠放的交通锥。另一桶汽油。一个贴着便签的步话机。我甚至还有一把从某人家里找到的剑。

Wait, traffic cones? I... don't remember getting those things. Were they here before?
等等，交通锥？我……不记得拿过这些东西。它们之前就在这儿吗？

Mama loves me. 妈妈爱我。

Yeah. But Mama's not here, is she? There's just Asuka. With a shake of my head I huddle in on myself; with my sweat drying, it feels almost chilly.
是啊。但妈妈不在这儿，对吧？这里只有明日香。我摇摇头，蜷缩起身子；汗水干了，感觉有些凉意。

This is a house. Like Mama's house.
这是一栋房子。像妈妈的家一样。

No, it's... well, maybe a little. But there's only me now, no Mama, no Shinji. Nobody but me.
不，它……嗯，可能有点像。但现在只有我一个人，没有妈妈，没有真嗣。除了我，没有别人。

I'll be safe here. No one can hurt me. Why did he hurt me, before?
我在这里会很安全。没人能伤害我。他之前为什么要伤害我呢？

I don't know. Because he's an idiot? I don't care; I'm fine without him. He's a creep and a jerk and he tried to kill me and I hate him.
我不知道。因为他是个白痴？我不在乎；没有他我也过得很好。他是个讨厌鬼，是个混蛋，他还试图杀了我，我恨他。

I hurt him, though. I hurt him so bad, earlier. I shouldn't have done that.
但我确实伤害了他。之前我把他伤得很重。我不该那么做的。

Yeah, well, we all do stupid things. Shinji'll be fine in his little mountain aerie. And it's me I should be worrying about right now anyway, not him; he has too much to answer for.
是啊，我们都有犯傻的时候。真嗣在他那山间小巢里会没事的。现在我更应该担心的是自己，而不是他；他欠下的债太多了。

I can't even remember how long it's been since I've spoken to him, or seen him at all. A week, maybe? The days have been blurring together. Every night at dusk he shoots off a flare, and every night I watch it, stopping whatever I'm doing until it flickers and disappears into the twilight. I don't really want to have to pay attention to them but I do anyway, unable to peel my eyes from those twinkling points of starlight, like a cat following the motion of a laser pointer. But I'm not a cat. I'm a person. A big girl. Mama would be proud of me.
我甚至记不清有多久没和他说过话，或者根本没见过他了。一周？或许吧。日子都混成了一团。每天黄昏时分，他都会发射一枚信号弹，而我每晚都注视着它，停下手中的活计，直到它在暮色中闪烁着消失。我本不想去关注，却总是不由自主，目光无法从那些闪烁的星光上移开，就像猫儿追逐激光笔的光点。但我不是猫，我是人，是个大姑娘了。妈妈一定会为我骄傲的。

Grabbing a crumpled blanket from one side, I flop onto my side and cover myself. With the additional covering, under a roof of similar blankets, it's warm, a cocoon. I twitch and squirm until sleep takes me.
我从一旁抓起一条皱巴巴的毯子，侧身躺下，将自己裹起来。在这层层叠叠的毯子下，温暖如茧。我扭动着，挣扎着，直到睡意袭来。

My dreams are vague and undefined. Some feature Shinji and his hanging head and his choking hands and his questions calculated to hurt. I awake sweating, a little nauseous.
我的梦境模糊不清。有些梦里，有真嗣，他低垂的头，扼住喉咙的手，还有那些刻意伤人的问题。醒来时，我满身是汗，略感恶心。

It's nothing a little running around in the sun can't fix, though. I've been running a lot lately. Actually, now that I think about it, I should get running shoes, not hiking shoes.
不过，晒晒太阳跑跑步就能解决。最近我跑得挺多。说起来，我应该买跑鞋，而不是登山鞋。

With that thought, I skid to a stop in the middle of a street, then turn around and start running in the other direction. Shoes are free. The crowbar is heavy, and wants to slip in my sweaty hands, so I shift it around a lot as I move.
想到这里，我在街道中央猛地停下，随即转身朝另一个方向跑去。鞋子是免费的。撬棍很沉，在我汗湿的手中直想滑脱，所以我边跑边不停地调整握持。

In moments I can see a sporting goods store on the southern side of town. It's a fresh one, one I haven't hit yet, and it was farther away than a place I could have gone, but this way I get to break something new. When I'm a couple of meters from the storefront I leap into the air, screaming, and bring the crowbar smashing into one door.
不一会儿，我看到了镇南边的一家体育用品店。这家店还很新，我还没光顾过，而且比我能去的地方要远，但这样我就能打破新东西了。离店门还有几米时，我一跃而起，尖叫着将撬棍狠狠砸向一扇门。

Glass shatters, spraying in a vague arc onto the floor inside the store. I almost lose my balance on the landing, however, and I have to grab the doorframe to keep from tumbling onto the new mess I've created. Jagged glass remnants bite into my fingers, but it's better than getting lacerated on the floor.
玻璃碎裂，呈模糊的弧线溅洒在店内地板上。落地时我差点失去平衡，不得不抓住门框以防摔进自己刚制造的混乱中。锋利的玻璃碎片刺入我的手指，但总比被地板上的碎片割伤要好。

Wow, that was, um... maybe I should walk next time. Heh.
哇，那一下，呃……也许下次我该走着来。呵呵。

Clearing my throat, I release the doorframe and wipe blood absently onto my shirt. It'll stain, but the thing is already covered in LCL from one of the times it's rained recently. Clothes don't last very long anymore.
清了清嗓子，我松开倚靠的门框，漫不经心地将血迹抹在衬衫上。这会留下污渍，但衬衫本就因最近某次降雨沾满了 LCL。如今衣物已难持久。

My shoes crunch onto the broken glass, and I drop the crowbar carelessly. Then I frown at the interior of the store. Dust swirls sluggishly in the faint sunlight spilling in through the doors, but otherwise it's dark. Aisles and shelves disappear into forgotten depths towards the end of the store, like tunnels in a mine.
我的鞋踩在碎玻璃上嘎吱作响，随手丢下撬棍。随后，我皱眉打量着店铺内部。尘埃在透过门缝的微弱阳光中缓缓旋转，除此之外一片昏暗。货架和通道向店铺深处延伸，消失在被人遗忘的尽头，宛如矿井中的隧道。

I forgot the flashlight. Fuck.
我忘了带手电筒。该死。

Well, this'll still work. Shaking my head, I trot in and start inspecting what I can see. In addition to shoes, I could probably use some new socks; what I've found so far has worn out pretty quickly. I guess manufacturers didn't really expect people to be spending all day every day on their feet, in the heat. I suppose I could grab another car, but running is somehow more... satisfying. And this way I'm not bored. I hate being bored.
不过，这还是能应付的。我摇摇头，快步走进去开始查看能见之物。除了鞋子，我或许还需要些新袜子；迄今为止找到的那些很快就磨破了。我想制造商并未预料到人们会整天整日地站立在酷热中。或许我可以再弄辆车，但跑步不知怎的更令人满足。而且这样我就不会感到无聊。我讨厌无聊。

Some time later, maybe after half an hour, I step out of the store with my new shoes on and my old ones discarded somewhere inside. On the sidewalk, though, I stop.
过了一会儿，大约半小时后，我穿着新鞋走出了商店，旧鞋则不知被丢在了店里的哪个角落。然而，在人行道上，我停下了脚步。

Shinji is outside, on a bike, frowning at the broken door. His hair is much messier than normal, and he's gotten some sun. He looks different now, I reflect, somehow less... repressed. Maybe living in the wild has helped him. His shirt, one of those quick-drying things an athlete might use, looks new, but mudstains cover his jeans like makeshift camouflage. The wound on his temple, from the accident, has healed.
真嗣在外面，骑着自行车，皱眉看着那扇破门。他的头发比平时凌乱得多，而且晒黑了不少。我意识到，他现在看起来有些不同，似乎少了些...压抑。或许在野外生活对他有所帮助。他穿着一件运动员可能会用的速干衣，看起来很新，但牛仔裤上却沾满了泥渍，像是临时的伪装。他额头上那次事故留下的伤口已经愈合。

As the silence stretches, his frown disappears. Blue eyes widen slowly as they stare at me.
随着沉默的延续，他的皱眉消失了。蓝色的眼睛缓缓睁大，直直地盯着我。

I can feel my own eyes widening as I stare back, feel my mouth opening. I wasn't expecting this; fingers tighten on the crowbar. Something flutters inside me, something... panic? No. I feel trapped. Have to move.
我感到自己的眼睛也在睁大，嘴巴不由自主地张开。我没想到会这样；手指紧握着撬棍。内心有什么东西在颤动，是...恐慌吗？不。我感到被困住了。必须行动。

Eventually I do take a step, but it's towards Shinji. Another.
最终我还是迈出了一步，但那是朝着真嗣的方向。又一步。

He blinks, then smiles uncertainly. His mouth opens.
他眨了眨眼，然后有些不确定地笑了。他的嘴张开了。

Without hesitation I spin and bolt away, arms pumping. I'm fast, and I cover ground quickly, winding between buildings so he'll have trouble following me on his bike, if he even chooses to.
我毫不犹豫地转身就跑，双臂用力摆动。我跑得很快，迅速地穿梭在建筑物之间，这样即使他决定骑自行车追我，也会很难跟上。

I'm breathing heavily when I reach my home, panting and rasping; it's hot, with no clouds. Doubled over on the roof, I shake my head helplessly and try to catch my breath.
当我气喘吁吁地回到家时，呼吸急促而嘶哑；天气炎热，没有一丝云彩。我弯腰站在屋顶上，无奈地摇了摇头，试图平复呼吸。

What was he going to say? And why did I want to listen? I shouldn't, not after the shit he said to me last time. Thinks he's clever, thinks he's got insight because he sees the surface of my behavior and assumes the depths are still the same. Thinks I haven't learned because I don't wear my heart on my sleeve. Not everyone does, Shinji, you ass. Some people don't. Some people need time to figure things out, to be able to put things into words. You had your chance, jackass. You had your chance to talk to me, to work things out, and you spat in my face.
他打算说什么？我又为何想听？我本不该如此，尤其是他上次对我说了那些混账话之后。自以为聪明，自以为洞察一切，只因他看到了我行为的表象，便臆断我内心的深渊依旧如故。以为我没长进，因为我未将心事挂在脸上。并非人人如此，真嗣，你这蠢货。有些人不是这样。有些人需要时间去理清思绪，去找到合适的言辞。你曾有机会，混蛋。你本有机会与我交谈，解决问题，你却唾弃了我。

I hate him for that.
我为此恨他。

As I stand recovering, my eyes flicker to the home I've got, just blankets stretched over pole-like things I found, sections of gutter and so on. Shinji seemed so composed, so competent, with his nice bike and a GPS display or whatever it was mounted on the handlebars. And I've been running around with no bike, and I live in a play-fort. Something a little girl might have made.
当我站在那里恢复时，目光不由自主地扫向我所谓的家——不过是几块毯子搭在捡来的杆状物上，还有些排水沟的片段之类。真嗣看起来那么镇定，那么能干，骑着他那辆好自行车，车把上还装着 GPS 显示屏之类的东西。而我呢，连辆自行车都没有，住在这样一个像是小女孩搭建的游乐堡垒里。

Something snaps. Screaming, I dance forward and smash the crowbar into one of the supports; it flies over, sending a few blankets flopping around, but I'm not done. Again I strike at what I've made, and again, swinging with all the strength I can muster. Once the supports are gone, the traffic cones go sailing, falling apart as they bounce. A pile of water bottles explodes in every direction. A savage dent appears in the exhaust vent. Another. A third and more, until it's almost unrecognizable, a hunchbacked mess of crumpled metal.
突然间，某种东西断裂了。我尖叫着，舞动向前，用撬棍猛击其中一个支撑物；它飞了出去，几张毯子随之翻滚，但我并未罢手。我再次挥击我制造的混乱，一次又一次，倾尽全力地挥舞。一旦支撑物被摧毁，交通锥便四处飞散，落地时支离破碎。一堆水瓶炸裂开来，水花四溅。排气管上出现了一个野蛮的凹痕。又一个。第三个，还有更多，直到它几乎无法辨认，变成了一团佝偻的扭曲金属。

Then, arms quivering, I hesitate with the crowbar over the walkie-talkie, but only briefly. It's a thing tying me to him. It shatters, plastic and circuits and batteries flying halfheartedly away; the case jumps twice more under two more strikes.
接着，手臂颤抖着，我举着撬棍犹豫地停在步话机上方，但只是片刻。这是将我与他联系在一起的东西。它碎裂了，塑料、电路和电池无力地飞散；外壳在两次重击下又跳动了两下。

I stand. The crowbar thumps to the pebbled roof surface beside my feet. I'm cold on the inside. Determined. Bending, I retrieve the knife and inspect its glittering edge. Then I run towards the fire escape stairs and hop down to the first landing. Running shoes slam into steel grating, and a shock ripples up my legs, but I don't stop moving.
我站起身。撬棍砰的一声落在脚边的碎石屋顶上。我内心冰冷。坚定不移。弯腰拾起刀子，检查其闪亮的刀锋。随后，我朝着消防楼梯奔去，跳到第一个平台上。跑鞋重重地撞击在钢格板上，一股震动沿着双腿传来，但我没有停下脚步。

Sunlight glares on sharp metal with every step as I run towards the southeast, to the road that leads up to Shinji's perch. Soon the bay is sparkling to my left, sunlight on ruby waters, but I ignore it as I run. It's just a distraction, like the abandoned military hardware streaking past me on the edge of the road.
每向东南奔跑一步，阳光便在锋利的金属上闪耀，我朝着通往真嗣所在高地的道路前进。不久，海湾在我左侧闪烁，阳光照耀下的红宝石般的水面，但我视而不见，继续奔跑。这不过是干扰，就像路边掠过的废弃军用装备一样。

Eventually, however, I slow to a jog, then to a walk. After a few moments of that I stop, planting fists on my knees as I draw deep rasping breaths. I'm dripping in sweat, and thirsty. I'm going to be dehydrated if I keep this up, and honestly... it's pretty far to be running there.
然而，最终我还是放慢了脚步，从慢跑转为步行。几分钟后，我停了下来，双手撑在膝盖上，深吸着刺耳的气息。我汗流浃背，口渴难耐。如果继续这样下去，我会脱水的，说实话...这段路跑起来确实挺远的。

Dropping to my knees, I curl up in the middle of the road. Odd strands of hair are sticking to my neck, my cheeks, but it's the least of my concerns right now. I'm still breathing so hard I worry about hyperventilation.
我跪倒在地，蜷缩在路中央。奇怪的发丝贴在脖颈和脸颊上，但这已是我最不关心的事了。我仍在剧烈喘息，担心自己会过度换气。

I don't need him. I don't.
我不需要他。真的不需要。

What I do need, apart from water, is a vehicle, or a bike. Not a crappy car this time either, hopefully. Something fun to drive.
除了水之外，我真正需要的是一辆交通工具，或者一辆自行车。这次希望不是一辆破车，而是能带来驾驶乐趣的东西。

After a moment I straighten to kneel on the pavement, staring absently up the road. Then, frustrated, I hurl the knife ahead, watching it skitter across the road surface.
片刻后，我直起身来，跪在路面上，茫然地凝视着前方的道路。随后，感到沮丧的我将刀子向前扔去，看着它在路面上滑行。

Where the hell am I going to find a decent car, though? And realistically, what do I even need it for? I don't...
但我到底要去哪儿找一辆像样的车呢？说实在的，我甚至不知道自己需要它做什么。我不...

The knife skids into one of the JSSDF vehicles and bounces off, spinning to a halt a short distance away. I frown.
刀子滑进自卫队的一辆车里，又弹了出来，旋转着停在不远处。我皱起了眉头。

What about...? Nah. It wouldn't work. Would it?
那...怎么样？算了，行不通吧？

Curiosity gets the better of my weariness and I stand, stepping over to the nearest of the JSSDF vehicles, a surface-to-air missile system. To my surprise, the door opens. Though I suppose that makes sense, if guys were using this stuff when Third Impact started. I grin on realizing that some of these might even have fired at me.
好奇心战胜了我的疲惫，我站起身，走向最近的一辆日本自卫队车辆，那是一套地对空导弹系统。令我惊讶的是，车门竟然开了。我想这也在情理之中，如果他们在第三次冲击开始时还在使用这些装备的话。意识到其中一些可能还曾朝我开火，我不禁咧嘴一笑。

Shrugging, I hop into the vehicle, basically an armored Humvee fitted with the SAM system. The keys are still in the ignition, even. With a shake of my head I twist them, and the engine rumbles to life under me, a lion purring.
我耸了耸肩，跳进车内，这基本上是一辆装甲悍马，配备了 SAM 系统。钥匙竟然还插在点火器上。我摇了摇头，转动钥匙，引擎在我身下轰鸣启动，宛如一头狮子在低吼。

No way. No fucking way.
不可能。绝对不可能。

I'm not going to complain, though.
我并不打算抱怨。

Quickly I check the rest of the controls, but it's clear that being to fire missiles is beyond me. For now. There's some separate physical authorization required that I don't have.
我迅速检查了其余的控制装置，但显然发射导弹超出了我的能力范围。至少目前是这样。需要某种独立的物理授权，而我没有。

Not that it matters; I don't need to shoot at anything. Shifting the vehicle into gear, I back up, then grimace as a hard thunk jolts me. These guys parked pretty closely together.
其实这无关紧要；我不需要射击任何东西。我将车辆挂挡，倒车时，一个猛烈的撞击让我皱起了眉头。这些人停车靠得真近。

Somehow I manage to un-parallel park the damn thing, then set off down the bay road. Not up it. I don't know what I was thinking with the knife; there's no need to hurt Shinji himself. I'm just... cleaning up.
不知怎么地，我设法把这该死的东西从并排停车中开出来，然后沿着海湾路驶去。不是往上，而是往下。我不明白自己当时怎么想的，竟然带了刀；其实没必要伤害慎二本人。我只是……在清理而已。

The engine hiccups every now and then as I head down the road; it must have lain dormant for some time. I still want to know how long we were gone, but I suppose there's no way to find out for sure. I should just be glad the guys using this thing didn't expect to turn into LCL before they could take the keys back.
引擎不时地打嗝，当我沿着道路行驶时；它一定已经闲置了一段时间。我仍然想知道我们离开了多久，但我想没有确切的方法可以查证。我应该庆幸使用这玩意儿的人没料到会在取回钥匙前变成 LCL。

It doesn't take me long to get back into the city proper, and once I'm in I find that I'm just driving aimlessly. On spotting a convenience store, and realizing I left the crowbar on top of the apartment, I smash the doors open with the front of the truck, then back out a little bit and inspect the damage.
我不久便回到了市区，一旦进入，我发现自己在漫无目的地驾驶。看到一家便利店，意识到我把撬棍忘在了公寓顶上，我用车头撞开了店门，然后稍稍后退，检查损坏情况。

There isn't any. I grin.
没有任何损坏。我咧嘴一笑。

I duck into the store just long enough to grab some more water -- this running in the heat is killer -- and then I'm back in the Humvee, slamming on the gas. It's too heavy to peel out, sadly, but it does have some kick, and shortly I'm barreling through the city's crumbling streets, clipping some parked cars and swerving narrowly around others. Sunlight glares on the hood, in a line of windshield, shifting with every turn.
我迅速溜进店里，只为多拿些水——在热天里奔跑真是要命——然后我又回到了悍马车里，猛踩油门。遗憾的是，它太重了，无法急速起步，但它确实有些冲劲，很快我就疾驰在城市破碎的街道上，擦过一些停放的车辆，险些避开其他车辆。阳光在引擎盖上闪耀，随着每一次转弯，在挡风玻璃上划出一道道光影。

Something about this, though... seems familiar. Something... I could swear I've driven here before.
关于这里，总觉得有些熟悉……好像，我敢肯定以前来过这儿。

Asuka! 明日香！

I slam on the brakes just before an intersection, and the Humvee squeals into and through it, but not before I can see an accident just down one of the side streets. As soon as the truck finally skids to an angled halt, I back it up, into the intersection again, then stop, frowning off to the side.
在接近一个十字路口时我猛踩刹车，悍马车尖叫着冲过路口，就在那一瞬，我瞥见一条侧街上刚发生的事故。卡车最终斜着停下后，我倒回路口，再次停住，皱着眉头望向一旁。

That's it. Where I crashed before. The car is still there, accordioned into the roof of that delivery truck. It hasn't changed at all, silent, glittering in the sunlight.
就是这里。我之前撞车的地方。那辆车还卡在那儿，车顶被挤压成一团，嵌在送货卡车上。一切如旧，静静地，在阳光下闪着光。

After a moment I crank the wheel around and ease up on the brake, letting the truck putter its way closer to the accident. Yeah, there are the keys, still where I threw them. Over on that section of curb, past the vehicles, that's where I bandaged Shinji. I had his blood on my fingers that day. It was sunny then, too.
片刻后，我转动方向盘，松开刹车，让卡车缓缓驶向事故现场。看，钥匙还在我扔的地方。越过那些车辆，在人行道的那一段，就是我给真嗣包扎的地方。那天，我的手指沾满了他的血。那时也是阳光明媚。

Still frowning, I let the Humvee idle ahead, away from the accident. In moments I stop it again, in front of the house. It still looks the same, too, unremarkable on the outside, bricks and white paint, but through the big front window I can make out the living room where we sprawled, trying to read those stupid library books.
我依旧皱着眉，让悍马车缓缓前行，远离事故现场。不久，我又停了下来，停在房子前。它看起来还是老样子，外表平平无奇，砖墙和白漆，但从那扇大前窗望进去，我能看到我们曾躺过的客厅，试图阅读那些愚蠢的图书馆书籍。

I've been here since then, of course. I came once a few days later and watched the house for an hour from around the back of another one across the street, just to see what Shinji was doing. Once I realized he was gone I checked the place out and found his plaintive half-apologetic note and the walkie-talkie with my name on it. Then, for good measure, I scouted out the other houses nearby, just in case. In case of what, I couldn't really say, but I had the time and it seemed like a good idea. After his mention of propane grills the day of the accident, it caught my notice to find one three houses down in a place obviously inhabited previously by an Australian. NERV had scientists and techs from all over.
当然，自那以后我就一直在这里。几天后我又来了一次，从街对面另一栋房子的后面观察了那所房子一个小时，只想看看真嗣在做什么。一旦意识到他不在了，我就进去查看，发现了那张带着半道歉意味的便条和上面写着我的名字的对讲机。然后，为了保险起见，我还查看了附近其他几栋房子，以防万一。至于防什么，我也说不清楚，但我有的是时间，这么做似乎是个好主意。自从事故那天他提到煤气烧烤炉后，我就注意到三栋房子外有一家明显曾住过澳大利亚人的地方，那里有一个烧烤炉。NERV 有来自世界各地的科学家和技术人员。

Letting the truck accelerate to a leisurely idle again, I rumble down the street to the house with the grill, then stop and hop out. For some reason I can't wipe the thoughtful frown off my face as I trot towards the house, then around it to the back. The grill is still there, with two white propane tanks under it. Two. Probably one for use, and a spare.
让卡车再次缓缓加速，我沿着街道驶向那栋带烧烤炉的房子，然后停下车跳了出来。不知为何，我脸上的沉思表情始终挥之不去，我快步走向房子，然后绕到后面。烧烤炉还在那里，下面放着两个白色的煤气罐。两个。可能一个是用的，一个是备用的。

Of their own volition my hands reach out and unfasten the tubes and token restraints keeping them in place. They're heavy, I find, surprisingly heavy for being filled with a gas, albeit in liquid state, and they're unwieldy besides. I can only carry one at a time back to the Humvee.
我的双手不由自主地伸出去，解开了固定它们的管子和象征性的束缚。它们很重，出乎意料地重，尽管里面装的是液态气体，而且除了笨重之外还难以操控。我一次只能搬动一个，回到悍马车上。

With my new prizes I back the truck up, rolling quietly through abandoned streets until I'm about fifty meters from the accident. There I stop again and get out, wrapping both arms awkwardly around one of the tanks as I waddle towards the car Shinji found. Propping the LP tank on one knee, I fumble for the handle of one of the back doors, then pull it open. The tank then goes in, onto the floor, atop the crutch he found for me. In the interests of thoroughness I also jog over to find the keys, then toss them in for good measure.
带着新得的战利品，我倒着车，悄无声息地穿过废弃的街道，直到距离事故现场大约五十米的地方。我再次停下，下车，笨拙地用双臂环抱一个罐子，蹒跚地走向真嗣发现的那辆车。我一只膝盖支撑着液化气罐，摸索着后门的把手，然后拉开。罐子随即被放进去，落在地板上，压在我找到的拐杖上。为了周全起见，我又跑去找钥匙，然后扔进车里以备不时之需。

Hmm. Propane is heavier than air. One match from my pocket sets the fabric of the car's ceiling ablaze; one twist of the knob atop the tank starts it hissing.
嗯，丙烷比空气重。口袋里的一根火柴点燃了车顶的织物，引发熊熊大火；罐顶旋钮轻轻一转，便开始嘶嘶作响。

Closing the door most of the way again, I turn my back on it and wander over to where the two of us sat, or rather where Shinji sat and I tended to him. We were... here, I think, a little bit past a useless streetlight rising from the sidewalk. Here, his blood had dripped to the pale street, close to the corner of a blocky yellow zero painted on it. It's clean now, though, save for the faint reddish residue that's all over the city. Rain, I suppose.
再次将门掩上大半，我背对着它，漫步至我们曾坐过的地方，或者更确切地说，是真嗣坐过而我照料他的地方。我们当时...我想，就在这儿，略微越过了一盏无用的路灯，从人行道上耸立。就在这里，他的血滴落在了苍白的街道上，紧挨着一块方正的黄色“零”字涂鸦。现在这里已干净，除了遍布全城的淡淡红色痕迹，大概是雨水所致。

Nodding, I straighten. Behind me, the ground shakes, a silent percussive strike. A blink later the car explodes.
我点了点头，站直身体。身后，地面震动，无声的冲击波袭来。眨眼间，汽车爆炸了。

Debris showers me as I head back to the truck; tiny pieces of glass pepper my arms, and little chunks of metal rain on my back and shoulders. The light of what I assume to be a fireball engulfing the car is enough to throw a wavering shadow of my walking form onto the sidewalk briefly, even in daylight.
当我返回卡车时，碎片如雨般洒落在我身上；细小的玻璃碎片刺痛我的手臂，小块金属砸在我的背和肩上。那团我猜是吞噬汽车的火球的光芒，即使在白天，也足以在人行道上短暂投下我行走身影的摇曳阴影。

When I get back into the truck, the mirrors show me nothing but black smoke and red flames roiling up from behind the overturned delivery truck, which hasn't moved much. The engine of my stolen conveyance growls to life again, then carries me two blocks ahead.
当我回到卡车里，后视镜中映出的只有翻倒的送货卡车后方翻腾的黑烟与红焰，它几乎未曾移动。我偷来的这辆车的引擎再次咆哮着启动，载着我向前驶过两个街区。

After positioning the Humvee in front of the house, pointing at it, I fold arms over the steering wheel and lean forward to examine the structure before me. It looks so ordinary, but I was going to stay there for a while. Shinji did stay there. He wanted me to stay too. I wanted to go, to keep moving, but he wanted to stay, like it was home. Our home.
将悍马车停放在屋前，我指向它，双臂交叉搁在方向盘上，身体前倾，仔细打量眼前的建筑。它看起来如此平凡，但我即将在此暂住。真嗣确实住在这里。他也希望我留下。我本想继续前行，但他却想停留，仿佛这里是家。我们的家。

Breeze whispers. Sunlight dances between shifting leaves. The engine idles, a content rumbling.
微风轻语，阳光在摇曳的叶间跳跃。引擎空转，发出满足的低鸣。

I snarl, shifting my foot from the brake to the gas, and the engine roars in triumphant response. The Humvee lurches forward, bumping over the curb; the house grows quickly nearer.
我咆哮一声，将脚从刹车移至油门，引擎随即发出胜利的轰鸣。悍马车猛地向前冲去，颠簸着越过路缘；房屋迅速逼近。

Just before impact I close my eyes, and then there's a massive crunch, splintering wood, twisting metal. The steering wheel thumps into my chest and stomach, making me cough. When I open my eyes again, the vehicle has shattered the beautiful front window, and a meter of it is actually inside the house.
就在撞击前的一瞬，我闭上了眼睛，紧接着是一声巨响，木头碎裂，金属扭曲。方向盘重重地撞向我的胸腹，让我不禁咳嗽。当我再次睁开眼，车辆已撞碎了那美丽的窗户，足有一米长的车身竟已闯入屋内。

That's not enough. 这还不够。

Shifting into reverse, I back up, tearing up the ground, pulling sections of siding free from the house in a cloud of dust. Then, at the curb, I put it back in drive and slam on the gas.
我挂上倒挡，猛地后退，地面被撕裂，房屋侧板在一片尘土中被扯下。随后，在路边，我重新挂入前进挡，一脚油门踩到底。

This time almost half the Humvee is inside the house after the crash, and I gun it a few more times, teasing the thing a little farther in. It's a struggle, because the floor of the house is a little higher than the ground, but it's close enough. Leaving the engine running, I shoulder open the door and hop to the carpet. I've driven over the couch, I see, flattening the thing into wood splinters in the process, and one thick tire is now spinning about where Shinji was lying, once.
这次撞击后，悍马车几乎有一半嵌入了屋内，我又猛踩了几下油门，试图将它再推进一些。这很费劲，因为屋内地面的高度略高于外面，但已经足够接近了。我让引擎继续运转，用肩膀顶开车门，跳到地毯上。我注意到自己已经碾过了沙发，将其压成了木屑，而一个厚实的轮胎此刻正旋转在曾经是真嗣躺着的位置。

Without wasting time I heft the second LP tank out of the back, then set it near the truck, hissing its invisible contents into the house. It's a bigger space; it'll take more time. Hmm. Do these places have natural gas? A quick check in the kitchen confirms this; it's an easy matter to set the burners on high, and with no electricity there is no flame to blow out.
我毫不耽搁，从后部取出第二个液化石油气罐，将其放置在卡车旁，任其无声地向屋内释放气体。空间更大了，需要更多时间。嗯，这些地方有天然气吗？我迅速到厨房一查，果然如此；将炉灶调至高温轻而易举，而且由于没有电，火焰不会被吹灭。

Tugging a glossy black pillow from the wreckage of the couch, I use another match to light it, then toss the burning thing into the cab of the Humvee.
从沙发残骸中拽出一个光亮的黑色枕头，我用另一根火柴点燃它，然后将燃烧的枕头扔进了悍马车的驾驶室。

A weird tingling sparkles through my whole body as I hop down to the ground through the new hole in the house. I'm... what is it? Angry? Yeah, I think that's it.
当我从房子新开的洞口跳到地面时，一种奇异的刺痛感在我全身闪烁。我这是...什么感觉？愤怒吗？对，我想就是愤怒。

Quickly I take shelter behind the only tree in the yard, then lean out to watch what I've done. This should be interes--
我迅速躲到院子里唯一的那棵树后，然后探出身子，观察我所做的一切。这应该挺有——

The ground shakes. Light. Heat. I'm floating through stars and clouds and colors. Something slams into my whole body, doubling my vision, driving breath and reason out of me in one go.
地面震动。光芒。热量。我仿佛漂浮在星辰、云彩和色彩之中。有什么东西猛烈撞击我的全身，让我的视线加倍模糊，一口气将我的呼吸和理智都驱赶出去。

When I manage to lift my head from the pavement, half the house is on the yard instead of where it belongs, and all of it's on fire. The truck and SAM system are now nothing but blackened skeletons of metal. There's even debris in the street, I notice, along with me; not a meter from my head lies a twisted length of copper piping. The propane explosion must have set off the gas tank, then, or maybe the rockets or who knows what.
当我费力地从人行道上抬起头时，发现半个房子已经不在原位，而是落在了院子里，并且全都着火了。卡车和 SAM 系统现在只剩下烧焦的金属骨架。街道上甚至散落着碎片，我注意到，就像我一样；离我的头不到一米的地方，躺着一根扭曲的铜管。丙烷爆炸肯定引爆了油箱，或者是火箭，又或者是其他什么东西。

As flames and ugly greyish smoke ripple into the sky, I blink, and my jaw slowly drops open. What am I...? This was... I don't think I should have done this.
当火焰和灰蒙蒙的烟雾在天空中翻腾时，我眨了眨眼，下巴慢慢张开。我这是……？这本不该……我不认为我应该这么做。

Swallowing roughly, I climb to my feet, but then instantly fall back onto my ass, clutching my right ankle. Tears burn, threatening to fall, but I fight them back.
我艰难地咽了口唾沫，挣扎着站起来，但随即又跌坐回地上，紧抓着右脚踝。泪水灼热，几乎要涌出，但我强忍回去。

I don't think this was what Mama wanted.
我想这并不是妈妈所期望的。

Against my will warmth spills over onto my cheeks, and I bite my lips to keep them from quivering. Holding my twisted -- sprained? broken? -- ankle, it's all I can do to rock back and forth and try to keep my crying quiet. That... could have been my home.
不情愿地，温暖涌上我的脸颊，我咬紧嘴唇以防它们颤抖。我紧握着扭曲的——是扭伤？还是骨折？——脚踝，只能来回摇晃，尽力压抑哭泣声。那……本可以是我的家。

Unbidden, my eyes slide to the south and east, towards the ridge, but I can't see it from here anyway. I've managed to destroy everything connecting Shinji to me, but somehow it just feels... I don't know.
不由自主地，我的目光滑向东南方，朝向那道山脊，但从这里根本看不见。我设法摧毁了所有将我和真嗣联系在一起的东西，但不知为何，感觉就是……我说不上来。

I'm such an idiot. It's not stuff that keeps him always in the forefront of my thoughts. Not radios or cars or houses.
我真是个傻瓜。让他始终占据我思绪前端的，不是那些物品。不是收音机、汽车或房子。

I... I wish he were here. I wish he could help me up, give me a hand. Get me to where I could rest. I want to make some smartass comment about him and have him yell back.
我……真希望他在这里。希望他能扶我起来，伸出援手。带我到可以休息的地方。我想对他发表些尖酸刻薄的评论，然后听他大声回击。

Blinded by tears, I roll over onto my stomach and climb to hands and knees. Pain stabs into my exposed flesh from little bits of sharp metal on the ground, but I try not to think about it too much, and instead start crawling away.
泪水模糊了视线，我翻身趴在地上，艰难地爬行。地面上尖锐的金属碎片刺入裸露的肌肤，疼痛袭来，但我尽量不去多想，而是开始匍匐逃离。

### Chapter 07 Tempo Commodo
从容不迫

It's morning. Cloudy, warm. I'm sitting on a fallen tree trunk I've rolled over near my campsite, and my shoes make absent designs in the dirt in front of me.
清晨已至，天色阴沉而温暖。我坐在营地旁翻转过来的一段倒木上，脚尖无意识地在面前的泥土中勾勒着图案。

Should I start building my own house? It would beat sleeping in the elements, certainly, though I do kind of enjoy falling asleep under the stars. It's just waking to up to the occasional LCL rainshower that gets me.
我是否该动手建造自己的房子呢？这无疑比露宿野外要好，尽管我确实挺享受在星空下沉睡的感觉。只是偶尔醒来时遭遇的 LCL 阵雨让人有些不快。

No, I should probably just leave well enough alone, at least for now. Plus, how would I even build one? I doubt I'm strong enough to move a lot of heavy stuff around, and in any case I don't know anything about construction. There might be lightweight materials in the city, though, and possibly some how-to books or something. I guess it's an option I can keep open, and if all else fails I can just get a tent.
不，或许我应该暂时保持现状。再说，我怎么可能建得起房子？我怀疑自己是否有足够的力量搬运重物，何况我对建筑一窍不通。不过，城里或许有轻便的建材，也可能找到一些指导书籍之类的东西。这可以作为一个备选方案，如果实在不行，大不了买个帐篷。

My foot pauses on the ground and I blink. Without thinking, I've sketched out the rough form of a feminine face, with lines of long hair and a smug grin.
我的脚尖在地上停顿，我眨了眨眼。不知不觉间，我已在地面上勾勒出一个女性面庞的粗略轮廓，长发飘逸，嘴角带着一丝得意的微笑。

With a sigh I erase the image, kicking dirt back into a virgin state. It's been weeks. Weeks since we split up. A month, maybe? I don't really know. I had twelve flares originally, and I didn't run out until after I saw her at that store, and that was... over a week ago. So I guess only three weeks or so.
我叹了口气，抹去了那幅画面，踢起尘土，恢复一片未被触碰的状态。已经过去几周了。自从我们分手后。一个月，或许？我不太确定。我原本有十二支信号弹，直到在商店见到她后才用完，那已经是……超过一周前的事了。所以，我想大概只有三周左右。

It's long enough. More than long enough. I'm half-tempted to ride down there now and confront her, but she ran away last time only after I made a move to talk. So it has to be on her terms, I guess, or there will be nothing at all.
时间够长了。远超所需。我几乎忍不住想现在就骑车去找她，当面对峙，但上次我刚要开口，她就逃走了。所以，必须按她的条件来，我猜，否则就什么都不会有。

Wind stirs briefly, rippling my shirt and hair, stirring leaves. Should I get more flares? No, she knows where I am.
风短暂地吹过，拂动我的衬衫和头发，搅起落叶。我应该再弄些信号弹吗？不，她知道我在哪儿。

Despite the unbroken shell of clouds above, it's hot and, if anything, more humid than usual. My shirt clings uncomfortably to me, and I feel like I'm sweating through my jeans.
尽管头顶的云层密不透风，天气却异常炎热，甚至比往常更加潮湿。我的衬衫紧贴着身体，感觉很不舒服，仿佛牛仔裤里也在出汗。

There's a song in my head, too. I don't know the name of it, but it's classical, and the composer is... American or British, I think. The music sounds Arabic to me, though. I like it because it's heavy on the cello.
我脑海中也有一首歌。我不知道它的名字，但它是古典音乐，作曲家大概是美国人或英国人。然而，这音乐给我的感觉却带有阿拉伯风情。我喜欢它，因为大提琴的旋律很浓重。

I'm humming it even now, I realize. I've been doing that a lot lately.
我意识到自己此刻还在哼唱着它。最近我经常这样。

Standing suddenly, I stretch, then frown down at the dead city below. As part of my scavenging routine, I've started looking for music I can use. Tokyo-3, it seems, is abounding with portable players of all types, but the only one I've found with any battery power remaining at all was full of Korean pop. Which is okay, but it's not classical. Not the song I have in my head.
我突然站起身来，伸展了一下，然后皱眉俯视着下方那座死寂的城市。作为我搜寻物资的一部分，我开始寻找能用的音乐。东京-3 似乎到处都是各种便携式播放器，但我找到的唯一一个还有电的播放器里，却全是韩国流行音乐。虽然也不错，但不是我脑海中的那首古典曲子。

This is killing me. I'm sure the name of the composer or the piece will pop randomly into my head at some point, but it won't make the song go away.
这简直让我抓狂。我确信某一刻我会突然想起那位作曲家或那首曲子的名字，但这并不能让那首歌从我脑海中消失。

"I could play it," I realize aloud, still gazing at the city. "If I had a cello. That would be a pain, though, dragging one up here."
我能演奏它，"我自言自语，目光仍停留在城市上。"如果我有一把大提琴。不过，拖着一把大提琴上来可真够麻烦的。

Shaking my head, I glance once again at the meager pile of my belongings. I've long since read all the books, and learned almost nothing useful from them. Maybe I should read them again, to pass the time. Or rip out the pages and make paper planes. Maybe I could find an origami book at the library.
我摇了摇头，再次瞥了一眼我那堆可怜的行李。那些书我早就读完了，从中也没学到什么有用的东西。或许我应该再读一遍，打发时间。或者撕下书页，折成纸飞机。说不定能在图书馆找到一本折纸书。

Laughing, I climb on top of my log, then shout wordlessly into the silence. My voice echoes back to me, through the breeze, through the trees. It just seems funny that, if no one else comes back, something like origami might survive Third Impact, not for any practical or cultural reasons, but because I was bored.
我笑着爬上木桩，然后对着寂静无声大喊。我的声音随着微风，穿过树林，回荡在我耳边。这似乎很滑稽，如果再没有人回来，像折纸这样的东西可能会在第三次冲击中幸存，并非出于任何实际或文化原因，仅仅是因为我无聊。

Sweat trickles into my eyes as I stand there, and I blink it away irritably. This is bugging the hell out of me. I can't wipe the perspiration away because my arm is just as sweaty as my forehead, and the shirt isn't helping matters.
我站在那里，汗水流进眼睛，我不耐烦地眨眼将其驱散。这让我烦透了。我无法擦去汗水，因为我的手臂和额头一样湿漉漉的，而衬衫也无济于事。

Fuck it. Hopping down from the log, I wrestle myself out of the shirt, then throw it to the ground. After a moment I do the same with my pants, boxers, shoes and socks.
去他的。从圆木上一跃而下，我脱掉衬衫，随手扔在地上。片刻后，我又如法炮制，将裤子、内裤、鞋子和袜子一一脱下。

A breeze carries some measure of cool to my exposed skin, and I smile. This is much better.
一阵微风携带着些许凉意拂过我裸露的肌肤，我不禁微笑。这样舒服多了。

Briefly rooting around in the backpack, I find a package of dried fruit and dump some into my hand. Then, munching on an apricot, I wander over towards the road, bored, restless. It remains just I've left it, of course, lined with military vehicles, webbed with the occasional crack, and totally motionless.
我匆匆在背包里翻找，掏出一包干果，倒了一些在手上。随后，一边嚼着杏干，一边百无聊赖地朝公路走去。公路依旧如我离开时那样，排列着军用车辆，偶尔有裂缝交错，静止不动。

Closing a fist over my food, I climb atop the hood of one of the missile launchers, then gaze out over the water. I can see for... I don't even know how far from up here, but out in the distance the sea and clouds merge into a sort of dusty-pink twilight. I can also see the stone remains of Rei's head, still gazing in eternal startlement at nothing at all.
我攥紧手中的食物，爬上一辆导弹发射车的引擎盖，然后眺望水面。从这里我能看到多远，我自己也说不清，但远处海天相接，呈现出一种朦胧的粉红色暮光。我还能看到零的石像头部残骸，依旧永恒地凝视着虚空，带着惊愕的表情。

"It's hot out," I observe, popping a sliver of dried banana into my mouth. "And I'm naked." Nothing answers me but the wind and the distant waves below.
"外面真热，"我边说边往嘴里塞了一片干香蕉。"而且我还光着身子。"除了风声和远处海浪的回响，没有任何回应。

As I stand sightseeing, the gentle white noise of leaves and pine needles creates more noise in my head, or rather, music. The song is back now, or maybe it never left, but I can hear it with perfect clarity as though the orchestra were right in front of me. Every draw of a bow across strings, every bold stab of brass, I hear. The part that's in my head is a fugue, actually, with the cello going first, followed by viola, violin and then trumpet. Seven measures, twenty-eight beats of each, before the next one jumps in.
当我站在那里观光时，树叶和松针发出的柔和白噪音在我脑海中激起了更多的声响，或者更确切地说，是音乐。那首曲子又回来了，或者它从未离开过，但我现在能清晰地听到它，仿佛交响乐团就在我面前。每一次弓弦的拉动，每一次铜管乐器的强烈冲击，我都听得一清二楚。我脑海中的部分实际上是一首赋格曲，首先是低音提琴，接着是中提琴、小提琴，然后是喇叭。每个声部先奏七个小节，共二十八个节拍，然后下一个声部才加入。

Tossing the last of the fruit into my mouth, mostly to free my hands, I find myself gauging the trees dotting the steep slope below. Let's see. The cellos would be over here, these pines to my right; the other strings would follow leftward from there, with the trumpet types... well, I guess there's not enough room under the bluff for them. They can be where the rocks meet the water.
我把最后一点水果扔进嘴里，主要是为了腾出手来，我开始估量着下方陡坡上点缀的树木。让我想想。低音提琴应该在这边，右边这些松树；其他弦乐器会从那里向左延伸，至于喇叭类的……嗯，我想峭壁下没有足够的空间给它们。它们可以位于岩石与水相接的地方。

Wind swirls; leaves dance. The music starts again in my head.
风起旋舞，叶随风动。音乐再次在我脑海中响起。

"Da da da da, da da-da-daaa!" I'm not even aware I'm shouting until halfway through the first phrase; my hands move on their own, conducting an empty orchestra. "Da da da-da-da, daaa daaa!" The sequence repeats, with the violas coming in on the last cello note.
"哒哒哒哒，哒哒哒哒哒！" 直到第一句唱到一半，我才意识到自己在喊叫；双手不由自主地动起来，指挥着一个空无一人的乐团。"哒哒哒哒哒，哒哒哒！" 旋律重复着，最后一声大提琴音落下时，中提琴加入进来。

By the times the violins join, I can hear the music so clearly it hurts; clutching at my head, I shout the song as loud as I can, desperate to challenge the silence. When it's time for the trumpets, I can also hear drums, which is odd, because there aren't any in this part of the piece. An explanation surfaces in a few moments, however, when I realize I'm jumping up and down on the hood of the truck.
当小提琴加入时，我听到的音乐清晰得令人心痛；我紧抓着头，尽可能大声地唱出这首歌，拼命想要打破这寂静。到了该吹响小号的时候，我还听到了鼓声，这很奇怪，因为这一段乐章里并没有鼓。然而，几秒钟后，当我意识到自己正跳上卡车引擎盖时，解释便浮现了。

And then I stop. The music disappears, leaving only wind and distant waves.
然后我停了下来。音乐消失了，只剩下风声和远处的海浪声。

I'm... going a little nuts, aren't I?
我... 是不是有点疯了？

Swallowing, I hop down from the SAM, then scamper back to my clothes, covering myself the whole time. What the hell am I doing running around naked? My God.
咽了口唾沫，我从 SAM 上一跃而下，然后急忙跑回我的衣物旁，一路上遮掩着自己。我到底在干嘛，光着身子到处跑？天啊。

Once I have pants on, I pause with my shirt in my hands, then stride to the edge of the ridge and scowl down at the city. It's her fault I'm going crazy. I haven't spoken to another human being in weeks, and it's totally her doing.
穿上裤子后，我手里拿着衬衫停顿了一下，随即大步走向山脊边缘，皱眉俯瞰着城市。都是因为她，我才变得这么疯狂。我已经好几个星期没跟人说过话了，这全是她的错。

Snarling, I hurl my shirt over the edge, towards the trees a hundred meters or so below. "What the hell is wrong with you?" My voice cracks as I shout, or scream. "Do you like being alone? Do you think I do? What the fuck is your problem?" Descending into a wordless growling, I spin and find the nearest thing, which happens to be my water jug. Snatching it from where it lies, I unscrew the top and start dumping its contents out over the edge, shaking it to make it empty faster so that I can throw it, and then it occurs to me that this is pretty stupid.
我咆哮着，将衬衫扔向山下约百米处的树林。“你到底有什么毛病？”我大声喊道，声音都有些嘶哑了。“你喜欢孤独吗？你以为我喜欢吗？你他妈的到底有什么问题？”我陷入无言的低吼，转身找到最近的东西——恰好是我的水壶。从地上抓起它，拧开盖子，开始往山下倒水，摇晃着让它快点倒空，好让我能扔掉它，然后我意识到这真的很愚蠢。

With an awkward grimace I fumble the jug back to my chest, upright, then blink at it. This is silly. I... I need to move, to do something. I feel like I'm ready to... punch rocks or headbutt trees. And I need more water now in any case.
我尴尬地皱了皱眉，笨拙地将水壶抱回胸前，让它立正，然后眨了眨眼看着它。这太荒谬了。我……我需要动一动，做点什么。我感觉自己快要……去捶石头或撞树了。而且无论如何，我现在还需要更多的水。

Sighing, I find the rest of my clothes and another shirt, actually an undershirt, sleeveless and white. Why not? It's hot out. With one hand I lift my bike from the mud and swing a leg over it, then click over to my backpack and retrieve it.
我叹了口气，找到剩下的衣物和另一件衬衫，实际上是一件无袖的白色汗衫。为什么不呢？外面很热。我用一只手从泥泞中提起自行车，跨腿骑上去，然后切换到背包，取了出来。

And then I'm off, down the slope, steering by balance alone. The breeze feels nice.
接着我就出发了，沿着斜坡下滑，仅凭平衡来操控方向。微风感觉很舒服。

I wonder how she's doing. Probably not very well. Though I guess it's been a while since I've seen a fire or an explosion in the city, so... who knows? Eventually I cruise past the missing Humvee in the abandoned JSSDF battery and wonder, not for the first time, what the hell she did with it. It's good she hasn't figured out how to shoot the missiles yet.
我想知道她现在怎么样了。可能不太好吧。不过，我猜自从上次在城里看到火灾或爆炸已经有一段时间了，所以...谁知道呢？最终我骑车经过那个废弃的日本自卫队炮台里失踪的悍马车，这不是我第一次好奇，她到底把它弄到哪儿去了。幸好她还没学会怎么发射导弹。

Before long I'm coasting into the suburbs, threading my way through highways and ramps that merge and split in slow motion around me, and shortly after that I'm in a familiar residential district; I've done a fair amount of looting here. Letting the bike click to a gradual stop in a parking lot, I slide off it just long enough to fill up on water from inside, and then I keep moving, this time to houses.
不久，我便滑行进入了郊区，穿梭在高速公路和匝道之间，它们在我周围缓慢地合并与分离，很快我就来到了一个熟悉的住宅区；我在这里进行过不少搜刮。在停车场让自行车缓缓停下，我下车只是为了从里面补充水分，然后继续前行，这次目标是那些房屋。

I don't spend much time looting, but it's a good harvest today nevertheless. When I set off back up the mountain, I've got some more clothes, a nice new axe, a cigarette lighter and a second flashlight, just in case.
我并不常花时间搜刮物资，但今天收获颇丰。当我启程返回山上时，多了几件衣物，一把崭新的斧头，一个打火机，还有第二支手电筒，以备不时之需。

I barely even notice the ride up to my ridge anymore. When I get there, though, I still feel twitchy. Letting the bike fall back into its parking space near a reddish rock, I just stand motionless for a moment, then take the axe and stride off into the trees.
如今我几乎已不留意上山的路程。然而，抵达山脊时，我仍感到一阵紧张。让自行车倒回那块红岩旁的停车位，我静立片刻，随后拿起斧头，大步迈入林中。

There's a dead pine tree not too far away from my stuff, skeletal but still standing, an arrow pointing at the absent sun. Taking a deep breath, I pause to wipe sweaty hands onto my jeans, then heft the axe and start chopping.
离我的物品不远处，有一棵枯死的松树，骨架般矗立，仿佛指向已不见踪影的太阳的箭头。深吸一口气，我停下擦了擦手上的汗水，然后举起斧头开始砍伐。

Slowly daylight fades. A pile of wood pieces grows.
渐渐地，日光黯淡。一堆木柴逐渐堆积起来。

When it's finally dark, I've managed to chop the tree down and hack part of it into arm-sized chunks of firewood. My hands are blistered but whole, and the way back to my stuff is thick with shadows and hidden obstacles. Nevertheless, it only takes me about fifteen minutes to get a fire started, courtesy of a couple dozen pages of the basic automotive care guide. This is about all it's good for, now.
夜幕终于降临，我已将那棵树砍倒，并劈成手臂粗细的柴火。双手虽起了水泡，但还算完好，返回物品处的路途昏暗不明，障碍重重。然而，仅用了大约十五分钟，我就借助那本基础汽车保养指南的几十页纸点燃了火。如今，这大概就是它仅有的用处了。

Exhaling heavily, I drop to sit on my log-bench. I'm sore all over, but... that helped. I doubt cutting down trees will be a long-term solution to solitude, but it worked tonight.
我重重地呼出一口气，跌坐在木桩凳上。全身酸痛，但……这确实有所帮助。我怀疑砍树并不能长期解决孤独问题，但今晚它奏效了。

Later, sprawled on my blanket, I watch sparks drift and dance up to the cloudy heavens above. This is nice, but if the rest of life is like this... it's going to suck. Silence is pleasant, but only as a respite from noise.
稍后，我摊开在毯子上，望着火花飘舞升向云雾缭绕的天际。这很美好，但如果余生都如此……那将会很糟糕。寂静令人愉悦，但只是作为噪音的短暂休憩。

Eventually, while the fire is still going, I curl up and close my eyes. Crackling wood lulls me to sleep.
最终，在火势未减之际，我蜷缩起身体，闭上了眼睛。噼啪作响的木柴声哄我入眠。

At some point in the night, however, I stir, groggy and confused. Lifting my head, I blink around for a moment before spotting what woke me.
然而，在夜里的某个时刻，我突然惊醒，昏昏沉沉，茫然不解。抬起头，我眨了眨眼，环顾四周，这才看清是什么把我吵醒。

Asuka is here. Just on the other side of the firepit, arms folded across her chest, scowling at me. Red coals throw just enough feeble light to trace out her figure in stark terms, warm fiery outlines.
明日香就在这里。就在火坑的另一边，双臂交叉在胸前，对我怒目而视。红色的余烬投射出微弱的光芒，勾勒出她轮廓分明的身影，温暖而炽热的线条。

I blink again, stifling a yawn with my fist, and stare back at her. Am I dreaming this? I think I was dreaming about... was it her? Or is it morning? No, it's dark. The coals are still warm on my face.
我又眨了眨眼，用拳头掩住呵欠，回望着她。我是在做梦吗？我刚才梦到的是……是她吗？还是已经是早晨了？不，天还黑着。余烬的温度仍贴着我的脸颊。

She just stands there, not moving a muscle, almost glaring. Eventually I glare back. How long has she been there, not saying anything? And why the hell is she so mad?
她就那样站着，纹丝不动，几乎是在怒视。最终，我也回以怒视。她已经站在那里多久了，一句话也不说？她到底为什么这么生气？

Something pops softly among the coals. Leaves rustle in trees lost to darkness.
炭火中传来轻微的爆裂声。树叶在黑暗中迷失的树枝间沙沙作响。

Shrugging irritably, I fall back to the ground, tugging the blankets around me. As soon as my eyes are closed I succumb to sleep once again.
我烦躁地耸了耸肩，倒回地上，拉紧身上的毯子。一闭上眼，我又再次沉入梦乡。

This time my dreams are warm. Sunshine, blue seas, not red ones. Laughter and music and just... warmth.
这次我的梦境温暖如春。阳光普照，碧海蓝天，而非血色一片。欢声笑语，乐音悠扬，还有那纯粹的...温暖。

When morning rolls around I awake with a jerk, sitting upright, staring all around the campsite in confusion. Was... she was here, wasn't she? She came back. And I shut her out. Granted, I was sleepy and confused, and a little grumpy, but that... I'm not going to get another chance, am I? Crap.
清晨来临，我猛地惊醒，坐直身子，困惑地环顾四周的营地。她...她来过，不是吗？她回来了。而我却将她拒之门外。虽然当时我困倦、迷茫，还有点脾气，但那...我不会再有机会了，对吧？糟糕。

Swallowing against a sudden burning in my eyes, I reach a hand up to rub my face, but something tickles my nose. I freeze for a moment, then pull my hand away and frown at it.
强忍着眼中突如其来的灼热，我伸手去揉脸，却有什么东西轻挠着我的鼻子。我愣了一下，然后把手抽回来，皱眉看着它。

There's a long red hair hooked through my fingers. And... the blankets next to me have been flattened, but I wasn't sleeping there. And I smell like Asuka.
一根长长的红发缠绕在我的指间。而且... 我旁边的毯子被压平了，但我并没有睡在那里。我身上还残留着明日香的气味。

Fuck.

Letting my hand drop back to my lap, I peer all around, looking for any sign of her, but she's gone. I'm alone again.
我把手放回膝上，四处张望，寻找她的任何踪迹，但她已经离开了。我又一次孤身一人。

Last night I wasn't even thinking about how long she'd been gone, like I'd forgotten that part totally; instead I was just mad at her for glaring at me in my sleep when I hadn't done anything. But even so... she slept next to me, without my consent. She stole affection from me. I didn't even know you could do that.
昨晚我甚至没去想她已经离开多久了，仿佛完全忘记了那部分；相反，我只是因为她在我睡觉时瞪我而生气，尽管我什么也没做。但即便如此... 她未经我同意就睡在了我身边。她从我这里偷走了温情。我甚至不知道这种事也能发生。

This is a little... I feel like a... like a prostitute. Except for cuddling instead of sex, and I don't get paid.
这有点像……我感觉自己像个……妓女。只不过是用拥抱代替了性，而且我还没拿到钱。

What the hell? Throwing my blanket aside, I rise and run barefooted over to the road, but there's no sign of her. She's been gone for a while, I guess.
搞什么鬼？我掀开毯子，光着脚跑到路边，但已经不见她的踪影。估计她已经离开好一会儿了。

"Fuck! Asuka? Are you here?" I cup hands to my mouth to shout, and though my voice bounces faintly back to me from neighboring peaks, there is no response from her.
"该死！明日香？你在这儿吗？" 我双手拢在嘴边大声呼喊，尽管我的声音微弱地从邻近的山峰反射回来，却听不到她的任何回应。

Turning, I kick helplessly at the dirt.
转身，我无奈地踢着地上的泥土。

### Chapter 08 Tranquillo E Dolce
宁静而甜蜜

As I walk down Irie Road, it starts to rain. For once I barely even notice how it smells.
当我漫步在艾里路上，天空开始飘雨。这一次，我几乎没注意到雨的味道。

I'm exhausted. I didn't sleep at all last night. For one thing, it took longer to reach the ridge on foot than I expected -- I see why he has a bike -- but then while I was lying there with him I couldn't fall asleep.
我筋疲力尽，昨夜彻夜未眠。首先，徒步到达山脊比预期耗时更长——难怪他有辆自行车——但随后躺在他身边时，我却无法入睡。

It was totally within his rights to glare at me, I suppose. Hell, I was probably giving him a look like that too. But as angry as he was, or seemed, as soon as he was asleep, he got... sweet. He rolled to his side and threw an arm over my stomach, threaded fingers through my hair. Every now and then, when he stirred, he would just squeeze me for no reason.
我想，他瞪我完全有他的道理。天知道，我可能也那样瞪过他。尽管他怒气冲冲，或看似如此，但一旦入睡，他就变得温柔起来。他侧过身，手臂搭在我的腹部，手指穿过我的发丝。每当他稍有动静，就会无缘无故地紧抱我一下。

I didn't sleep because I spent all night trying not to cry.
我彻夜未眠，只因整晚都在努力忍住不哭。

This is a new thing for me. I don't entirely get it.
这对我来说是件新鲜事。我还没完全搞明白。

I wonder if he'd be like that to anyone, or just me. Probably anyone, I suppose; if he had to beg me for emotional intimacy during Instrumentality just because I happened to be there, he's likely to be just as undiscriminating in giving affection as well. So what does that make me? In retrospect I guess I... used him, last night, but now I'm not so certain I came out ahead on that deal.
我在想，他会不会对谁都这样，还是只对我。大概对谁都一样吧；如果他在“共融”期间只是因为我恰好在他身边就向我索求情感上的亲密，那他在给予爱意时可能也同样不加选择。那我算什么呢？回想起来，我猜我昨晚……利用了他，但现在我不确定自己是否真的占了上风。

My right ankle still throbs with every step. I didn't break it, though, and if I sprained it, it hasn't gotten in my way except to hurt. My hands have mostly healed again, at least, though they're still sore in places.
我的右脚踝每走一步都隐隐作痛。虽然没有骨折，但如果扭伤了，除了疼痛之外，它并没有妨碍我。我的双手基本上又恢复了，至少，尽管有些地方仍然感到酸痛。

I still don't really know why I did that, why I decided to head up there. I guess I had to see him. I'm still mad for the shit he said to me right before I left, but it's sort of like... inertia; that's the last significant interaction I had with him, so that's what's stuck in my head. And it's not like I don't have other reasons to be pissed off at him. In any case, though, I don't think it's good for me to be alone all the time, and probably not him either, but it would be too humiliating just to show back up and offer some lame apology for my absence. Oh, hey, Shinji. Sorry I've been gone for the better part of a month and stuff. Got any sunscreen? I'm running out.
我至今仍不太明白自己为何那么做，为何决定去那里。我想我必须见他一面。他临别前对我说的话仍让我怒火中烧，但那就像是一种惯性；那是我们最后一次重要的交流，所以一直萦绕在我心头。而且，我对他还有其他不满的理由。无论如何，我觉得自己总是一个人并不好，他大概也是，但就这样回去，为我的缺席随便道个歉，未免太丢脸了。哦，嘿，真嗣。抱歉我几乎一个月没露面了。你那儿还有防晒霜吗？我的快用完了。

It's stupid, I know, but there it is. He's in my head, and though I've tried everything I can think of to get him out, he's still there.
我知道这很愚蠢，但事实就是如此。他盘踞在我脑海中，尽管我尝试了所有能想到的办法想把他赶出去，他依旧挥之不去。

I wonder... would Kaji have been that tender? I have a hard time believing so. Funny how a girl's priorities can change over time.
我在想……如果是加持，他会那么温柔吗？我很难相信。真有趣，女孩的偏好随着时间竟会变化如此之大。

Eventually, some time around midmorning, I make it to my new home. The old one hurt too much to get up to, with my bum ankle, so instead I'm now living in a storage garage in the same area of the city. It keeps me dry from the rain, and the cement is actually slightly cool. Once there I heave open the door, then flop to a pile of towels I keep just inside for rainy days. I'm beat, but it doesn't take too much energy to rummage through my things for an electrolyte drink and a half-eaten jar of applesauce. This is probably the last time I should eat from it, though; stuff like that doesn't stay good for long now, with no refrigerators.
终于，大约在上午过半的时候，我抵达了新家。旧居因我那扭伤的脚踝而变得难以攀爬，于是我转而住进了城市同一片区的一个储物车库。这里能让我免受雨水侵扰，水泥地面甚至还有些许凉意。一到地方，我便用力推开大门，然后瘫倒在门内我为雨天准备的毛巾堆上。我疲惫不堪，但翻找东西的力气还是有的，我找出了一瓶电解质饮料和半罐吃剩的苹果酱。这恐怕是我最后一次吃它了，没有冰箱，这种东西很快就会变质。

While I eat, I stare absently out into the steel-and-concrete remains of the city, half-hidden by a haze of falling rain. Rain, and tiny tiny bits of dissolved people.
我一边吃着，一边茫然地望向被雨雾半遮半掩的城市钢铁与混凝土废墟。雨中，还夹杂着细小的人体溶解物。

Shortly I rise again on watery legs and shut the door most of the way, allowing only a bar of greyish light to filter in from outside. Then, after stripping down to my underwear, I drop to a mattress I scavenged from a nearby apartment and fall instantly asleep.
不久，我拖着虚弱的腿站起来，将门关得只剩一条灰蒙蒙的光线透进来。随后，我脱得只剩内衣，倒在从附近公寓搜刮来的床垫上，立刻陷入了沉睡。

When I awake later, it's no longer raining and I'm still tired. Moving mechanically, I dress and slip into shoes, then grab my trusty crowbar and head out into the city. Reddish puddles all around reflect a leaden sky above.
当我稍后醒来时，雨已经停了，我依旧感到疲惫。机械地穿上衣服，套上鞋子，然后抓起我那可靠的撬棍，踏入城市之中。四周的红褐色水洼映照着上方铅灰色的天空。

Shinji's idea of having a bike is a good one, if I'm going to be heading up to the ridge again, so that's my first priority today. After maybe an hour I manage to find a decent one just lying on the sidewalk, as though its rider was absorbed into Instrumentality while still moving. It's even red, too.
真嗣提议弄辆自行车是个不错的主意，如果我还要再去山脊的话，今天首要任务就是找一辆。大约过了一个小时，我在人行道上发现了一辆不错的自行车，仿佛它的骑手在行进中被融入到了人类补完计划中。而且它还是红色的。

After picking the bike up and brushing dust and flaked LCL off of it, I ride it in a few brief circles in the street, just to make sure it's comfortable. It is.
捡起自行车，拂去上面的灰尘和剥落的 LCL 后，我在街道上骑了几圈，只是为了确认骑起来是否舒适。确实挺舒服的。

From there I cruise the streets briefly, weaving around just for fun. I wish my hair would fly back behind me, but it's kind of stringy now. Living like a bum hasn't been good for it.
之后我短暂地在街道上穿梭，只是为了好玩。我希望我的头发能随风飘扬在脑后，但现在它已经有些干枯了。像流浪汉一样生活对它可不好。

With that thought in mind, when I finally stop riding and get back to looting, I head straight for the bathroom in the first house I check. Fortunately it seems a woman lived here, because there's good stuff in little bottles all over the place. A shower and some decent conditioner leaves me in a slightly better mood. Even seeing my scars doesn't really bug me anymore; my original beauty is just... gone, so there's no need to worry about it.
带着这样的念头，当我终于停止骑行，开始搜刮时，我径直走向检查的第一栋房子里的浴室。幸好这里似乎住着一位女士，因为到处都是装着好东西的小瓶子。洗个澡，用上不错的护发素，我的心情稍微好转了一些。就连看到自己的伤疤也不再那么困扰我了；原本的美貌已经……消失了，所以没必要为此烦恼。

As soon as I step out the bathroom and start scavenging, however, my eyes fall upon a book lying open on the floor in one bedroom. A photo album. Frowning, I shuffle over there, then sit cross-legged on the floor next to it.
然而，我一走出浴室开始搜寻物资，目光便落在了一个卧室地板上摊开的一本书上。那是一本相册。我皱着眉头，拖着脚步走过去，然后盘腿坐在它旁边的地板上。

Flipping back to the beginning, I find myself staring down at a Japanese woman in a hospital bed, smiling tiredly at the camera as she holds a newborn baby. Feeling my frown deepen, I flip the page. And then, after a moment, I flip the next.
翻回到开头，我看到一位日本女性躺在医院的床上，疲惫地对着镜头微笑，怀里抱着一个新生儿。我的眉头皱得更深了，我翻过一页。然后，过了一会儿，我又翻了一页。

The pictures tell me she's a single mother, and the baby is a girl. Almost every shot is of the kid, or with the kid, or of the woman and a couple of men I assume to be her brothers, since all three have the same eyebrows. For whatever reason, some of the pictures jump out at me. The woman in the crisp uniform of a rank-and-file NERV tech, squinting against the sun as she smiles, and the wind pulls her hair almost sideways. The daughter as a toddler in a blue dress, pointing a chubby finger at a a sleeping dog. Both mother and daughter asleep on a couch, covered by a blanket patterned with fuzzy little chicks and kittens.
照片告诉我，她是一位单亲妈妈，而宝宝是个女孩。几乎每张照片都是关于孩子的，或是与孩子一起的，或是这位女士与我认为是她兄弟的两三个男人，因为三人都长着同样的眉毛。出于某种原因，有些照片特别吸引我。那位女士穿着 NERV 基层技术人员的整洁制服，迎着阳光眯眼微笑，风几乎将她的头发吹得横飞。女儿还是个穿蓝色裙子的小孩，胖乎乎的手指指向一只熟睡的狗。母女俩在沙发上睡着了，身上盖着印有小鸡和小猫图案的毛毯。

The album is less than half full.
相册还没装满一半。

It's never occurred to me to think about this, but I suppose Third Impact swept up the very young along with everyone else. Kids too young to know what was going on. Are any of them strong enough to come back here on their own? Or will this photo album stay as it is now when the mother gets back? Maybe get tucked away somewhere and wept over from time to time?
我从未想过这个问题，但我想第三次冲击也卷走了那些年幼的孩子，他们太小，根本不知道发生了什么。他们中有谁能自己回到这里吗？还是这本相册会保持现状，等母亲回来后，也许会被收起来，偶尔拿出来流泪怀念？

I used to loathe people like this, people lacking genius and with no ambitions in life save for to spend time with family. How unoriginal, how forgettable. No vision. But now, I feel... not jealous, but just... sad. Sad and tired. I want to take the album with me, but... I can't. It's not mine.
我曾厌恶这样的人，缺乏天赋，一生志向不过是与家人共度时光。多么平庸，多么容易被遗忘。毫无远见。但现在，我感到的...不是嫉妒，而是仅仅...悲伤。悲伤且疲惫。我想带走那本相册，但...我不能。它不属于我。

It's over an hour before I move at all. The photo album goes carefully, gently back on the floor.
过了超过一个小时，我才有所动作。小心翼翼、轻柔地将相册放回地板上。

After leaving the house, I spend the next hour feeling strangely subdued as I break into other dwellings in the neighborhood. Instead of smashing windows, this time I just pry doors open, causing as little damage as I can. Which makes sense, really, since that's how the crowbar is supposed to be used.
离开那所房子后，接下来的一个小时里，我在邻近的住宅中闯入其他人家，感到异常的沉静。这次我没有砸碎窗户，只是撬开门，尽可能减少破坏。这其实很合理，毕竟撬棍本就是用来撬门的。

When it gets to be around dusk, I find my way back to my new home and drop off the goods I've looted, perhaps the most important of which is a little battery-powered fan. It'll be nice, but I'd kill for air conditioning. Though... now that I think about it, there's no reason I couldn't find a generator and get a unit working. Eventually.
当黄昏将近时，我回到了新家，卸下偷来的物品，其中或许最重要的是一个小型电池风扇。它会带来舒适，但我更渴望空调。不过...现在想来，我完全可以找到发电机，让空调运转起来。迟早的事。

Quickly I find some food and consume it, then hop back on the bike and set off up the hill. The ride is a little tiring, and eventually my ass and most of my back get sore, but by that point I'm almost up there. It turns out Shinji was kind enough to light a fire for me again, so it's an easy matter to pinpoint where he is, once I get close enough to see evidence of warm light through the trees.
我迅速找了些食物吃下，随即跳上自行车，开始向山上骑行。这段路程略显吃力，不久我的臀部和背部大部分都开始酸痛，但那时我已接近山顶。原来，Shinji 又一次好心地为我点燃了篝火，因此当我靠近到能透过树丛看见温暖光亮的迹象时，很容易就确定了他的位置。

I stop my bike some distance from his little campsite, then heel the kickstand down and slide to my feet. My legs hurt, and it feels like the ground is somehow too soft, so for a moment I just stand in place and listen. All I can hear is the breeze rustling through trees, but that doesn't mean he's asleep. It's two hours past dusk, but that doesn't mean anything with him.
我在离他小营地一段距离处停下自行车，用脚跟放下支架，然后站起身来。我的双腿疼痛，感觉地面似乎异常松软，于是我暂时站在原地倾听。耳边只有风穿过树林的沙沙声，但这并不意味着他已经入睡。虽然已是黄昏后两小时，但这对他来说并不代表什么。

When I'm confident he's not coming out to the road to investigate, I stealth forward, slipping between the trees, trying to keep my footsteps to patches of ground free of leaves, needles and twigs. Shortly I pause behind the bristling body of a pine tree and peer around it. Sure enough, he's asleep, lying on his side, facing the fire, which has dwindled to a pile of glowing red, decorated here and there with little candle-like orange flames. I usually think of sleeping people as peaceful, but Shinji looks... a little pissed-off. I wonder what he's dreaming about.
确信他不会出来查看后，我悄无声息地前进，穿梭于树木之间，尽量让脚步落在没有落叶、松针和枯枝的地面上。不久，我停在一棵松树后，树干茂密，我探头窥视。果然，他睡着了，侧躺着，面朝火堆，火势已减弱成一堆暗红的余烬，点缀着几朵如烛火般的小小火焰。我通常认为睡着的人看起来很安详，但真嗣的表情……似乎有些愠怒。不知道他梦见了什么。

Slowly I edge forward, ghosting towards the fire, to the spot where I stood last night. Even with the fire on its way out, it's warm here, dry and comfortable. A good place to sleep.
我缓缓向前挪动，如幽灵般接近火堆，来到昨晚站立的位置。尽管火势渐熄，这里依旧温暖，干燥而舒适。是个适合睡觉的好地方。

Moments pass. The fire crackles, a quiet murmur.
时间流逝。火堆噼啪作响，低声细语。

I shouldn't. I know I shouldn't. I don't really think he wants me to, but despite that, it would help me. Help both of us. You don't share Instrumentality with somebody without learning a thing or two about him, and I know Shinji's probably losing it up here alone. He's been alone his whole life, but even that was certainly better for him than this. It probably took everything he had to ask me for help, back in the kitchen.
我不该这么做。我知道我不该。我并不真的认为他希望我这么做，但尽管如此，这会对我有帮助。对我们俩都有帮助。与某人分享心灵合一的经历而不从中了解他一些事情是不可能的，我知道真嗣可能在这里独自一人快要崩溃了。他一生都是孤独的，但即便那样，对他来说也肯定比现在好。他可能在厨房里请求我帮助时，已经用尽了所有的勇气。

As though my thoughts are noise, his eyes slide slowly open, then blink and regard me blankly. Red embers shift and pulse in the shadow pools staring back at me. Whatever's in his face, I can't read it at all.
仿佛我的思绪是噪音一般，他的眼睛缓缓睁开，然后眨了眨，茫然地看着我。红色的余烬在凝视着我的阴影中移动和脉动。他脸上的表情，我完全读不懂。

Eventually he sighs, eyes closing, and rolls to his back; blankets shift and whisper, following his motion. A scowl re-forms on his face.
最终他叹了口气，闭上眼睛，翻身仰躺；随着他的动作，毯子轻轻移动，发出沙沙声。他脸上重新浮现出皱眉的表情。

I hesitate, frowning, uncertain if this is permission or negation. Or if he just doesn't care. I could just ask him, could just go over there now, but he's still awake and I don't think I could take it if he refused me. Not at this point.
我犹豫着，皱着眉，不确定这是否是允许还是拒绝。或者他只是不在乎。我本可以直接问他，现在就可以走过去，但他还醒着，如果他拒绝我，我想我无法承受。尤其是在这个时候。

I wait. Again. Eventually his breathing changes, becoming almost snore-like.
我等待着。又一次。终于，他的呼吸变了，变得几乎像打鼾一样。

Wilting somewhat at my cowardice, I sneak forward, around the fire, and slip out of my shoes and socks. Then, lifting the edge of his blanket delicately, I slide in. It's still warm in the space he just vacated, though being between the fire and Shinji himself has certainly helped with that.
因自己的怯懦而有些萎靡，我悄悄向前挪动，绕过火堆，脱下鞋袜。然后，小心翼翼地掀起他毯子的一角，我滑了进去。他刚离开的地方还留有余温，当然，火堆和身旁的真嗣也功不可没。

Letting my eyes close, I exhale slowly. Shinji doesn't move behind me; his wrist is actually in contact with me, and his shoulder, but the poor idiot has no idea.
我闭上眼睛，缓缓呼出一口气。真嗣在我身后一动不动；他的手腕实际上正触碰着我，还有他的肩膀，但这可怜的傻瓜却浑然不觉。

Before long, however, he shifts, rolling back towards me, sliding an arm around my middle for all the world like we've been doing this forever instead of for two nights. After a moment his forehead thumps into my back.
然而不久，他开始挪动，翻身向我靠拢，手臂自然地环抱在我的腰间，仿佛我们不是只这样相拥了两夜，而是已经习以为常。片刻后，他的额头轻轻抵在我的背上。

Swallowing, I rest fingertips gently on his forearm. This is wrong. I know it's wrong, but it's so... comfortable. He should be enjoying this too, really. It's warm having him there, having his arm around me, and part of me wants nothing more than to snuggle back into him and sleep and dream of a different world. But the rest of me advises caution, warns quietly that I shouldn't be here when he wakes. Better to have peace in the night than acrimony in the morning. As cheap as it is. At least this way we're not totally alone all the time.
我咽了咽口水，轻轻地将指尖搭在他的前臂上。这是不对的。我知道这是不对的，但它又是如此……舒适。他应该也在享受这一刻，真的。有他在身边，他的手臂环绕着我，感觉很温暖，我的一部分只想蜷缩回他怀里，沉睡并梦见一个不同的世界。但另一部分的我则提醒自己要小心，轻声警告我，他醒来时我不应该在这里。宁可在夜里拥有安宁，也不要在早晨面对尖刻。尽管这样做很廉价。至少这样我们不是完全孤独。

Letting my eyes drift back open, I gaze at the glowing embers ahead. There's just something about the night, I guess. I wouldn't do this much in the day.
我缓缓睁开眼睛，凝视着前方的发光余烬。我想，夜晚总是有些特别之处。在白天，我不会这么做。

Abruptly he stirs, murmuring something indistinct behind me, and his arm twitches. He's waking up.
他突然动了动，在我身后含糊不清地嘟囔着什么，手臂也抽搐了一下。他醒了。

Before I know what I'm doing, my thumb is stroking his arm, trying to will words into his mind. Shhh. It's okay, Shinji. It's me. You know me. You can be a jerk, but I don't hate you, not really. I am not the jagged sum of my actions towards you, or if I am, at least you know some of why I'm like that now. Nobody else does, not like you do.
在我意识到自己在做什么之前，我的拇指已经开始抚摸他的手臂，试图将话语传递到他的心中。嘘，没事的，真嗣。是我。你认识我。你有时很讨厌，但我并不真的恨你。我并非只是对你行为的总和，即使我是，至少你现在也知道了一些我变成这样的原因。没有其他人像你这样了解我。

It's strange, me trying to soothe him. I feel like our roles are reversed.
真是奇怪，我试图安慰他。感觉我们的角色互换了。

Eventually he relaxes again, and his breath falls back into the unmindful rhythm of the slumbering. I stop stroking his arm and instead just touch it. Touch skin. Human skin.
最终他又放松下来，呼吸恢复到熟睡时那种无意识的节奏。我停止抚摸他的手臂，转而只是轻轻触碰。触碰肌肤。人类的肌肤。

Tonight is... different from last night. Then, he smelled like sweat, like smoke and pine sap. Almost manly. Tonight he smells more like blood, though that's probably due to the rain, and maybe a little like... grapes? I wonder what he had that smells like that. Regardless, though, it's still Shinji, just another part of him.
今晚与昨晚不同。那时，他身上有汗味，有烟味和松脂味，几乎带着男子气概。而今晚，他更多地散发出血腥味，这可能是因为雨水，还略带一点...葡萄味？我想知道他吃了什么会有这种味道。尽管如此，他依旧是真嗣，只是他另一面的展现。

Again, I can't sleep. Again, his unwitting affection drags out my unease to counter the peace he gives me.
我又一次无法入睡。又一次，他无意识的关怀将我的不安拉扯出来，以对抗他给予我的平静。

I leave an hour before dawn, slipping carefully out of the blankets and into my shoes. Sparing him one last confused frown, I wait a moment, then edge through the trees to where I left my bike.
我在黎明前一小时悄然离开，小心翼翼地从毯子中钻出，穿上鞋子。对他留下最后一个困惑的皱眉后，我稍作停留，然后悄悄穿过树林，来到我停放自行车的地方。

The ride back down the road is an easy one, even in the dark. Once into the city, I coast through shadowed intersections and motionless streets, passing several places I vandalized a couple of weeks ago. I feel a little embarrassed about that, now.
沿着道路骑车返回相当轻松，即使在黑暗中也是如此。一进入城市，我便滑行过阴影重重的十字路口和静止的街道，经过几处我几周前破坏过的地方。现在想来，我感到有些尴尬。

Once back to my place, it's just getting light out. A good time to go to sleep, then. If I keep this up, I'll be nocturnal.
回到住处时，天色刚蒙蒙亮。正是睡觉的好时候，如果我继续这样下去，恐怕要变成夜行性动物了。

I don't even know what time it is when I awake again, but it's still light. With no real need to scavenge today, instead I ride around for a couple of hours, just looking for interesting stuff. Parks, mostly. There are two near my garage, it seems, one that's little more than a playground and an overgrown soccer field, and one that has a couple of overgrown flower gardens surrounding a reddish pond. I think I prefer the second, despite the water.
再次醒来时，我甚至不知道是什么时间，但天色依旧明亮。今天并没有真正需要去搜寻物资，于是我骑车闲逛了几个小时，只是寻找有趣的东西。主要是公园。我的车库附近似乎有两个，一个不过是游乐场和杂草丛生的足球场，另一个则围绕着红色池塘有几处荒废的花坛。尽管有那池水，我想我还是更喜欢第二个。

Was he right? I wonder. I did learn stuff, didn't I? I'm certainly not the same person I was a month or two ago.
他说的对吗？我琢磨着。我确实学到了东西，不是吗？我肯定不再是那一两个月前的我了。

While the sun is still setting, I grab a quick dinner and then set off up the hill again. I feel like an addict; I can't even contemplate not going up there. As I muscle my way up Irie Road, dusk starts falling, and the clouds above finally begin to break up.
趁着太阳还未完全落山，我匆匆吃了晚饭，便再次向山上出发。我感觉自己像个瘾君子；甚至无法想象不去那里的情景。当我奋力沿着艾瑞路攀登时，暮色开始降临，头顶的云层终于开始散开。

On reaching the ridge I once again stop the bike and just listen. I think I've gotten here earlier than last night, but it's still dark, and I still don't hear anything.
到达山脊时，我再次停下自行车，只是静静聆听。我想我比昨晚来得早些，但天色依旧昏暗，我仍旧什么也没听见。

With a shrug I leave the bike standing and sneak through the trees separating the campsite from the road. Then, on rounding the big pine, I stop.
我耸了耸肩，让自行车立在原地，悄悄穿过将露营地与道路隔开的树木。然后，绕过那棵大松树时，我停下了脚步。

Shinji's awake. In bed, granted, but obviously awake and staring at me.
真嗣醒了。虽然还躺在床上，但显然已经醒了，正盯着我看。

I swallow, suddenly uncertain. His fire is still crackling steadily away in the firepit between us, giving the area more light than in previous nights, and the illumination shows me his face as cautious as mine, chewing a lip.
我咽了口唾沫，突然感到不确定。他那边的火仍在火坑中稳定地噼啪作响，比前几晚为我们所在的地方提供了更多的光亮，火光映照出他那与我一样谨慎的脸庞，正咬着嘴唇。

I have to wait. I... can't force him into anything.
我必须等待。我...不能强迫他做任何事。

Long moments stretch even longer while we match gazes. Gradually the conflict on his face becomes more apparent, but then, to my surprise, he shakes his head. In the time it takes him to roll to his other side, facing away from me, I can see an expression of clear pain on his face, as though this is a choice he's not totally happy with.
我们对视着，时间仿佛被拉得更加漫长。渐渐地，他脸上的矛盾愈发明显，但出乎我意料的是，他摇了摇头。在他转身背对我的一瞬间，我看到他脸上露出了明显的痛苦表情，仿佛这个决定并非完全出自他的本意。

I can feel my mouth open slightly at his refusal, feel my eyes blink a few times. My heart thuds once, heavily, then resumes its normal course.
我能感觉到自己的嘴巴因他的拒绝而微微张开，眼睛眨了几下。心脏重重地跳了一下，随后又恢复了正常的节奏。

The fire crackles away, throwing warm light onto his motionless back.
火堆噼啪作响，温暖的火光洒在他静止不动的背上。

Swallowing again, I turn, then shuffle back towards my bike. A single backwards glance confirms that he still hasn't moved.
我再次咽了咽口水，转身拖着脚步向我的自行车走去。回头一瞥，确认他依旧没有动弹。

Once onto my bike, I coast down the hill in silent moonlight. Or drift, really. I... can't believe he did that to me.
一骑上自行车，我便在静谧的月光下沿着山坡滑行。或者说，是飘荡。我……真不敢相信他竟然那样对我。

But why not, really? I knew it was wrong. Hell, it's not altogether different from what I told him during Instrumentality: if I can't have all of you, I don't want you at all. I was half-teasing when I said it, but it was also true; I didn't want anything to do with a Shinji who came to me just when he needed to be put back together. I had, and still have, neither the skill, patience nor desire for that. It was partly impatience speaking, too; if you want me, just come out and fucking say so, you wimp. And now, here he is, saying the same thing back to me. Or at least the latter half. I don't want you at all. Fucking wimp.
但为什么不行呢，真的？我知道这是错的。天哪，这与我在人类补完计划时对他说的并无太大不同：如果我不能拥有完整的你，那我宁愿不要你。我那时半开玩笑地说出这话，但也是真心话；我不想与那种只在需要修复时才来找我的真嗣有任何瓜葛。我既没有那份技巧、耐心，也没有那种欲望。这其中也有急躁的成分；如果你需要我，就直截了当地说出来，你这个懦夫。而现在，他在这里，用同样的话回敬我。至少是后半部分。我宁愿不要你。真是个懦夫。

My teeth start to grind of their own accord as I angle into the night-cloaked city proper. So what about me, now? Where does this leave me? There's something in my head that can't let go of him, and my one avenue of contact with him has now been severed. Is there another one I can find, or make up? Or should I just find someone else? Or wait for someone else to come back at all? If anyone will.
当我驶入夜幕笼罩的城市中心时，牙齿不由自主地开始咬紧。那么现在，我该怎么办？这让我何去何从？我脑海中有种东西无法放下他，而现在我与他唯一的联系途径已被切断。我能找到或创造出另一条途径吗？还是我应该干脆另寻他人？或者等待其他人回来？如果还有人会回来的话。

Who would even fit the bill, though? Kaji? No, I still don't think he'd be the type. Maybe for Don Juan seductions, but not simple affection, and probably neither with me. Which... really, now that I think about it... is probably good. So in that case, how about... no, I... I guess I don't really know any other guys that well, do I? And I'm not going to cuddle at night with a girl.
谁会符合这个条件呢？加治？不，我还是觉得他不是那种类型。或许适合唐璜式的诱惑，但不是简单的温情，而且很可能对我也不是。这么一想……其实，现在想来……可能反而是好事。那么，还有谁呢……不，我……我想我其实并不太了解其他男生，对吧？而且我也不会在夜里和女生依偎。

So that leaves me Shinji. Nobody else. And, as I think about it, I don't even want it from anyone else; there's nobody from whom that kind of affection would carry anywhere near the same significance it would from him. I mean, he knows better than anyone else how unpleasant I can be, so if he can still feel it in him to cuddle with me, honestly, then that would... mean a lot.
所以，只剩下真嗣了。没有别人。而且，仔细想想，我也不想从其他人那里得到这种情感；没有人能像他那样，给予我同样重要的意义。我的意思是，他比任何人都清楚我有多难相处，所以如果他还能有拥抱我的冲动，坦白说，那将……意义非凡。

I need him. I need Shinji. And he just shut me down.
我需要他。我需要真嗣。而他刚刚拒绝了我。

I squeeze the bike's brakes so hard the tires skid to a dramatic halt. Then, leaping groundward, I grab the frame, lift it over my head and hurl it with all my strength at at the nearest window. "God damn it!"
我用力捏紧自行车的刹车，轮胎在剧烈的摩擦中戛然而止。随即，我跳下车，抓住车架，举过头顶，用尽全力向最近的窗户砸去。“该死的！”

With a fantastic crash, the bike tumbles to the floor inside a little consumer gadgets shop, along with lots of broken glass and a random collection of window merchandise. Growling, I leap after it into moonlit darkness, ignoring the jolt of pain from my still-mending ankle on the landing. My hands find a section of steel mesh, the kind used to hold up package hooks, and without a thought it goes sailing through the store, crunching into a big-screen television. "God damn it! Shinji!" I'm shrieking, I realize, not just shouting, but I don't care. A sweep of one hand sends a stack of cell-phone packages flying; an overhead throw shatters a stereo receiver against the wall.
随着一声巨响，自行车连同许多碎玻璃和一堆随意陈列在橱窗里的商品，一起摔落在一家小型消费电子用品店内。我低吼一声，紧跟着跳进月光照耀的黑暗中，落地时刚愈合的脚踝传来一阵剧痛，我却置之不理。双手摸索到一段钢丝网，那种用来挂包裹钩子的，想都没想就将其甩向店内，砰的一声砸中了一台大屏幕电视。“该死！真嗣！”我意识到自己在尖叫，不仅仅是喊叫，但我不在乎。一挥手，一堆手机包装盒飞散开来；向上抛掷，一台立体声接收器撞在墙上碎裂。

As I'm jumping up and down on a handful of novelty remote-control vehicles, however, I slow, then eventually stop with a sigh. It's just... not the same anymore. And, frankly, this isn't going to help anything.
然而，当我跳上一堆新奇的遥控玩具车时，动作渐渐放缓，最终叹了口气停了下来。只是...感觉不再一样了。而且，坦白说，这样做也无济于事。

Shaking my head, I gingerly lift my bike back up from the wreckage, pausing to pluck a shard of glass from where it had gotten stuck in the seat. That would not have been comfortable.
我摇摇头，小心翼翼地将自行车从废墟中扶起，停下动作，从座椅上拔出一片扎进去的玻璃碎片。那肯定不会舒服。

Climbing back out the windows proves to be something of a chore, but shortly I'm pedaling absently through the moonlit streets again. As I ride, as usual my eyes are drawn to the ridge above. It's too late for his fire still to be visible, but I know where it is, where he is. Sleeping without me. As is his right.
从窗户爬出来确实有些费劲，但不久我又漫不经心地骑着车穿梭在月光下的街道上。骑行中，我的目光一如既往地被山脊吸引。此刻已太晚，他的篝火不再可见，但我清楚它的位置，他的所在。他独自安睡，这是他的权利。

But then, this is nothing more than a minor setback. I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. All I need is a change of plans.
然而，这不过是小小的挫折。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我需要的只是一次计划的调整。

A/N: At Daetor's request, the soundtrack to Shinji's madness in the previous chapter is the finale of Symphony No. 22, Op. 236, "City of Light," by Alan Hovhaness. I didn't mention it before because the content of the song doesn't really relate to the story in any meaningful way, but I figured it's something Shinji might like. Plus it's easy to get stuck in your head.
作者注：应 Daetor 的要求，上一章中真嗣疯狂的背景音乐是阿兰·霍瓦内斯的《光之城》第 22 号交响曲，作品 236 号的终章。之前未提及，是因为这首曲子的内容与故事并无实质关联，但我想这或许是真嗣会喜欢的音乐。而且它很容易让人陷入沉思。

### Chapter 09 Allegretto Scherzando
诙谐的小快板

I shouldn't have turned her away.
我不该把她赶走的。

It's morning again, and all I can do is lie here on my back, staring at the clear sky above, shaking my head. The latest humid streak appears to have moved on, leaving it merely hot, though so early in the day it's almost refreshingly cool.
又是清晨，我只能仰躺着，凝视着上方澄澈的天空，摇头叹息。最近那股潮湿似乎已经过去，只留下炎热，尽管一大早，却几乎有种令人神清气爽的凉意。

I screwed up. I was just... I just didn't want her to use me anymore, and I wanted her to know that. For once I was going to be strong, to deny her something she was trying to gain by bending the rules, just to prove a point. Even if it was pleasant for me in the meantime. I never thought she'd be the type to want something like that, especially with me, so it was hard to say no; for once, she was... nice. Even if we didn't say anything. Maybe because we didn't say anything.
我搞砸了。我只是...我只是不想她再利用我，我想让她明白这一点。这次我要坚强，拒绝她试图通过打破规则来获得的东西，只为证明一个观点。即使这对我来说很愉快。我从没想过她会是那种想要这种东西的人，尤其是和我，所以很难拒绝；这一次，她...很温柔。即使我们什么也没说。也许正是因为我们什么也没说。

But now I feel like an ass. When I rolled over, away from her, I figured she'd just get pissed and stalk back to her bike, maybe bitching me out or something first. But that's not what happened. Instead it took her a long time to move, and when she did, her footsteps were slow and quiet.
但现在我觉得自己像个混蛋。当我翻身背对她时，我以为她会生气，然后愤然走回她的摩托车，也许先对我发泄一番。但事情并非如此。相反，她过了很久才动身，而且当她移动时，脚步缓慢而轻柔。

She wasn't mad. She was hurt.
她并非愤怒，而是受伤了。

When I realized that, it suddenly threw a new light on everything. As hard as it was for me to say no to her, it must have been nothing compared to difficult it was for her to come up here in the first place. She was extending me a truce. She's probably too proud just to come up and apologize, or ask for my apology or whatever it is she wants, so what she did was just to forego speaking altogether. If I'd been more receptive, I bet she would have stayed around when morning came, and things would have gone back to normal. Or something like normal.
当我意识到这一点时，一切都豁然开朗。尽管我难以拒绝她，但与她最初鼓起勇气来到这里的艰难相比，必定微不足道。她在向我伸出和解之手。她或许过于骄傲，不愿直接上来道歉，或索求我的歉意，抑或她所期望的任何东西，因此她选择的方式是彻底沉默。若我当时更为接纳，我相信她会在清晨留下，一切将恢复如常，或接近如常。

Still, there was no need for subterfuge. Does she think that after all the stuff we've been through after Third Impact, followed by all that time alone, that if she'd asked to hang out I would have told her to screw off? If she wanted my affection like that, she could've asked, and I would have given it to her.
然而，并无必要使用诡计。她是否认为，经历了第三次冲击后的种种，以及那段孤独时光，若她提出想一起消磨时光，我会让她滚蛋？如果她渴望我的关爱，她本可以直接开口，我定会给予。

Oh my God. I would have given it to her.
天哪，我本会给予她的。

Leaves dance above me in the moment it takes me to close my gaping mouth. So... I wonder if that means I like her. It seems like sort of a stupid question, especially now, but then again it should be answered. I mean, yeah, before I knew anything about her, I thought she was hot, and really I still do, but it's way more than that. There are so many things binding us together now that a relationship with anyone else would just seem shallow in comparison.
当我合上惊讶的嘴巴时，树叶在我上方舞动。那么...我在想，这是否意味着我喜欢她。这似乎是个愚蠢的问题，尤其是在此刻，但终究需要答案。我是说，没错，在了解她之前，我就觉得她很迷人，现在依然如此，但远不止这些。如今，我们之间有太多牵绊，与其他人的关系相比之下显得肤浅。

But maybe I don't want relationships. Maybe I just want friendship. Understanding. I haven't had a lot of that either.
但或许我不想要关系。或许我只想拥有友谊。理解。这些我同样缺乏。

Not like it matters anyway. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, I suppose.
无论如何，这并不重要。我想我有点操之过急了。

With a sigh I sit up, throwing my blankets aside. I have stuff to do, and there's no reason I can't think and work at the same time.
我叹了口气坐起身，掀开被子。我有事要做，同时思考也无妨。

Even without rushing it doesn't take me long to dress, and afterwards I spend a few moments munching on dried fruit to take the edge off my hunger. While eating I find my eyes drifting towards the city below, looking so peaceful in the sunlight. Peaceful and empty.
即便不急，我穿衣也花不了多少时间，之后我会花几分钟嚼些干果来缓解饥饿感。吃东西时，我的目光不由自主地飘向下方沐浴在阳光中的城市，显得如此宁静。宁静而空旷。

In moments I'm on my bike and sailing down the hill. It's a pleasant ride this morning, bordering on chilly, but I'm trying to enjoy it while I can. It won't be long until the heat returns or a storm sweeps in.
转眼间，我已骑上自行车，顺着山坡滑行而下。今早的骑行颇为惬意，略带凉意，我正尽力享受这短暂的舒适。不久后，要么酷热重临，要么一场风暴席卷而至。

I should apologize. I'm not sure I could find her, though, if I went looking.
我应该道歉。不过，即便我去找她，也不确定能否找到。

Today, I've decided, is a day for clothes scavenging. As such I angle towards one of the department stores in this part of town, since finding clothes in my size in houses or apartments is too unreliable, and half of what I do find that fits is actually for women. Plus, if I'm just going to be throwing this stuff away after a week or less, I may as well wear something that no one has grown attached to.
今天，我决定，是时候去搜寻衣物了。因此，我朝着城里这个区域的一家百货公司前进，因为在住宅或公寓里找到合我尺码的衣服太不可靠，而且我找到的一半合身衣物实际上是女装。再说，如果这些衣服我穿不了几天就要丢弃，那还不如穿些没人留恋的东西。

When I roll into the parking lot, it's getting hot out again. With a shake of my head I step through the shattered doors -- I've been here before, and she probably has too -- and flip on my flashlight. A cone of thin illumination plays over still shelves as I wave it around; gaudy signs jump out at me, promising great deals on some winter special the place must have been having. It smells dusty in here now, like concrete and darkness. It didn't, always.
当我驶入停车场时，外面又开始热起来了。我摇了摇头，穿过破碎的大门——我以前来过这里，她可能也来过——然后打开了手电筒。一束微弱的光线在我挥动下扫过静止的货架；花哨的促销牌跳入眼帘，承诺着这里曾有的冬季特卖大优惠。现在这里弥漫着尘埃的味道，像是混凝土和黑暗的混合。以前并非总是如此。

Most of the sale signs have sparkly snowflakes on them. I wonder what snow is like. I wonder how many people coming here even remembered it, or associated it with winter.
大多数促销牌上都闪烁着雪花图案。我好奇雪是什么样的。我好奇来这里的人们有多少还记得雪，或者将它与冬天联系起来。

Darkness weighs in around me, oddly concentrated in the directions the flashlight isn't pointing, as I climb up the motionless escalator. Men's clothes are on the first floor, but kids' are upstairs. I don't care all that much what I wear, since only I have to see it -- and maybe Asuka -- so it doesn't take long to pick some stuff out. When I head back down the escalator a few minutes later, I'm wearing a dark grey t-shirt with some sword-wielding cartoon character on the chest, and I've tucked something similarly silly under my arm. I also found a blue Dragons baseball cap in my size; I don't know why I didn't think of that before.
四周的黑暗异常浓重，尤其在手电筒未照及的方向，我沿着静止的自动扶梯向上攀爬。男士服装在一楼，而儿童服装则在楼上。我并不太在意自己的穿着，毕竟只有我自己——或许还有明日香——会看到，因此很快便挑选了几件衣物。几分钟后，当我再次乘坐自动扶梯下楼时，身上已换上一件胸前印有持剑卡通人物的深灰色 T 恤，腋下还夹着一件同样滑稽的衣物。我还找到了一顶适合我尺码的蓝色龙队棒球帽；真不明白之前怎么没想到。

On the way out of the store, I slow and swipe a pair of sunglasses from a display near the registers. Something else I should have thought of before, with all the sun.
离开商店时，我在收银台附近的展示架上顺手拿了一副太阳镜，慢下了脚步。阳光如此强烈，我早该想到这一点。

There's a residential district close to the store, so I head there after reclaiming my bike from the parking lot. I can already appreciate the benefit of the hat and shades. I'm an idiot for not getting that stuff before.
商店附近有一个住宅区，取回自行车后，我便朝那里驶去。我已经能感受到帽子和太阳镜带来的好处。之前没准备这些，我真是愚蠢。

Maybe I should get some more flares. Then she'd know she was still welcome.
或许我该再弄些信号弹。那样她就会知道，她依然受到欢迎。

Quickly I reach a house I've stopped at before and duck inside, already pulling my new clothes off; I feel caked with mud and LCL residue these days, and the occasional shower doesn't keep it away for long. With my flashlight pointing at the ceiling from the vanity, I settle in for ten minutes of earth-cool water running over me.
我迅速来到一栋曾停留过的房子前，闪身入内，迫不及待地脱下新衣；连日来，身上总是沾满泥泞和 LCL 的残留，偶尔的淋浴也难以持久洗净。我将手电筒从梳妆台上照向天花板，安顿下来，享受着十分钟大地般清凉的水流冲刷。

But then, about halfway in, while my hair is still lathered with borrowed shampoo, the water chokes and splutters. And then it stops.
然而，洗到一半时，头发还带着借来的洗发水泡沫，水流突然呛咳起来，接着便戛然而止。

Blinking away stinging shampoo suds, I frown up at the showerhead. Somewhere inside the house, the plumbing grumbles angrily. This isn't good.
我眨着眼，试图驱散刺痛的洗发水泡沫，皱眉望向花洒。屋内某处，管道发出愤怒的隆隆声。这可不是好兆头。

After a moment, however, something gurgles, and then the shower continues. I finish up as quickly as I can, then scowl at nothing as I towel myself off.
片刻后，水管咕噜作响，淋浴又继续了。我尽快结束洗浴，用毛巾擦干身体时，对着虚空皱起了眉头。

Crap. If the water is giving out on us, that's going to suck.
糟糕。如果水源出了问题，那可就麻烦了。

I think about that as I head back up the hill. It would seem pretty inefficient to bathe with bottled water. What else can I do, though? Almost as an afterthought I stop at another house, just long enough to grab soap and towels and a washcloth. It'll keep me going until I can think of something else.
我一边往山上走，一边思考这个问题。用瓶装水洗澡似乎太不经济了。但我还能怎么办呢？几乎像是事后想起似的，我在另一栋房子前停下，匆匆拿了肥皂、毛巾和一块洗脸巾。这至少能让我撑到想出其他办法。

On reaching my site on the ridge, I slow on my bike, then stop a good fifty meters away. There's another bike there, standing jauntily across the road as though to block all traffic. It's red, glittering metallically in the sunshine.
到达山脊上的营地时，我放慢了骑车的速度，然后在离那里大约五十米的地方停了下来。那里还有一辆自行车，俏皮地横在路中间，仿佛要挡住所有交通。那是一辆红色的自行车，在阳光下闪着金属光泽。

Chewing a lip, I lean into the pedals and close the last distance to what has to be Asuka's bike. There's no sign of the girl herself, but the trees are too thick to see the campsite from where I am.
我咬着嘴唇，用力踩着踏板，缩短了与那辆必定是明日香的自行车之间的最后一段距离。女孩本人不见踪影，但从我所在的位置看去，树木太密，看不到营地。

Next to her bike I heel down the kickstand of my own, then slide to my feet and stand motionless. I can't hear anything, though. Nothing but wind murmuring through the trees.
在她自行车旁，我放下自己车子的脚撑，然后站起身来，一动不动。但我什么也听不见，除了风穿过树木的低语。

Why am I delaying this? It's not like she's going to try to kill me. Probably not, anyway. Sighing, I grip the backpack's straps and make my way through the trees lining the road. The site isn't far.
我为何还在拖延？她又不会试图杀我。大概不会吧。我叹了口气，抓紧背包带子，穿过路边排列的树木。目的地不远了。

Sure enough, Asuka is there when I step out of the trees. She's squatting on her heels, rooting through my stuff with a frown; on the muddy ground beside her she's already set aside my propane heater and a few bottles of water. Another backpack is slouching on the ground as well, one that must be her own.
果然，当我从树林中走出时，明日香就在那里。她蹲着，皱着眉头翻找我的东西；在她旁边的泥地上，已经摆好了我的丙烷加热器和几瓶水。地上还有一个背包，应该是她自己的，正歪斜地放着。

As soon as I appear she glances over at me, cool as you please, then stands up, idly brushing red hair from her face. Like me, she's sporting muddy jeans, and her sun-yellow t-shirt is long-sleeved, but probably thin enough to breathe well. Blue eyes blink calmly at me, one kissed with a jagged ring of pink.
我一出现，她就随意地瞥了我一眼，然后站起身来，漫不经心地拨开脸上的红发。和我一样，她穿着沾满泥的牛仔裤，那件太阳黄的长袖 T 恤虽然可能很薄，但透气性应该不错。她那双蓝色的眼睛平静地眨着，其中一只眼眶上有一圈参差不齐的粉色痕迹。

I stare back at her. Is she stealing my stuff? What is this?
我回瞪着她。她是在偷我的东西吗？这是怎么回事？

Eventually she gives her head a toss and gestures at the vague pile of my supplies. "So, I was thinking this nylon rope would make a good clothes line, between there and there. See?" Pausing, she points at a pair of trees standing maybe ten meters apart. "And then with that burner we could make hot water, and actually wash our clothes."
她最终甩了甩头，指着我那堆模糊不清的物资说：“我在想，这条尼龙绳可以用来做晾衣绳，就在那两棵树之间。看到了吗？”她停顿了一下，指向大约十米开外的两棵树。“然后我们用那个炉子就能烧热水，真的可以洗衣服了。”

After a few moments I manage to close my mouth. That's it? She's gone for three, four weeks, and then just shows up here and pretends like it never happened? I guess... so be it, if that's what she wants. "Um," I answer, trying to clear my frown. Seriously. "Maybe. I mean, yeah. Actually, no; I've just been throwing my clothes away when they get too dirty."
过了好一会儿，我才勉强合上嘴巴。就这样？她消失了三四周，然后就这么突然出现，装作什么都没发生过？我猜……如果她想这样，那就这样吧。“呃，”我回答，试图抹去脸上的不悦。说真的。“也许吧。我是说，对。其实，不；我一直是衣服脏了就直接扔掉。”

She rolls her eyes at this. "I have too, but it's stupid, really. Finding new ones is work we don't have to do; cleaning would be much faster."
她对此翻了个白眼。“我也是，但这真的很蠢。找新衣服是我们不必做的苦差事；清洗要快得多。”

I have a dark suspicion I know exactly who she thinks is going to be washing all the clothes, but I nod anyway. If that's what it takes, I suppose. "Whatever. Sure."
我心里有个阴暗的猜想，我知道她认为谁会去洗所有的衣服，但我还是点了点头。如果这就是必须的，那好吧。“随便吧。当然。”

Her eyes narrow at this unenthusiastic response, but then she grunts. Squatting again, she starts tucking my stuff back to where it all belongs.
她对这不够热情的回应眯起了眼睛，但随后又哼了一声。再次蹲下，她开始把我的东西重新整理回原位。

Giving my head a little shake, I shuffle into the campsite and let my backpack fall to the ground. She ignores me completely, moving quietly and without fanfare as she works.
我轻轻摇了摇头，拖着步子走进营地，让背包落在地上。她完全无视我，静静地、不张扬地继续她的工作。

I find myself just staring at her, albeit out of the corners of my eyes. What the hell is this all about, anyway? This is the same girl who ran away from me? And then snuck into my bed to sleep with me? Are there like... three Asukas running around now, or what?
我不由自主地用眼角余光盯着她。这到底是怎么回事？这个女孩，不就是那个从我身边逃走的吗？然后又偷偷溜进我的床和我一起睡？难道现在有三个明日香在四处游荡，还是怎么的？

Once my stuff is all together, she stands again, uncoiling the yellow nylon rope I picked up a week or so ago for no particular reason. When I say nothing, her brow furrows. "So are you going to help me, or what?"
当我把东西都收拾好后，她再次站起身，解开我大约一周前出于某种莫名原因捡来的黄色尼龙绳。见我没吭声，她的眉头皱了起来。“所以，你是要帮我，还是怎样？”

"Oh. Yeah, of course." As I'm still speaking, she tosses one end of the rope halfheartedly at me, and I jerk to catch it.
“哦，当然，当然。”我话音未落，她便半心半意地将绳子的一端抛向我，我急忙伸手去抓。

Together we spend maybe a quarter-hour getting the thing tied up, which seems like a long time, but most of it is me wrestling with a faceful of pine needles. When we're done, I spend a few moments spitting a stray handful out of my mouth, and plucking others from my face and shirt, but Asuka seems totally unaffected.
我们俩花了大约一刻钟才把那东西绑好，这时间似乎有点长，但大部分时间我都在与扑面而来的松针较劲。绑完后，我花了几分钟时间把嘴里的一把松针吐掉，又从脸上和衬衫上摘下其他松针，而明日香似乎完全不受影响。

Silence stretches, and belatedly I realize she's just watching me. Waiting. Her features are a little tight, her face slightly turned away from me; she seems... wary.
沉默在蔓延，我后知后觉地意识到她只是在看着我，等待着。她的表情有些紧绷，脸微微侧向一边，看起来……有些戒备。

I guess it's my turn to keep up the act. "Um, have you eaten? I have some stuff, although I guess you've already, uh..." I trail off as she starts digging through my piles again.
看来轮到我继续演下去了。"呃，你吃饭了吗？我这里有些东西，不过我想你应该已经，嗯……" 我话还没说完，她就又开始在我那堆东西里翻找起来。

Shortly she comes up with a package of instant noodles, then waves it imperiously at me. "I know it's hot, but it's been a while since I've had hot food, so I want this. Not yet, though. I'm not quite hungry."
很快，她翻出一包方便面，然后得意地朝我挥了挥。"我知道天热，但我好久没吃热食了，所以我想吃这个。不过现在还不饿。"

It's been a while. There, she almost said it. Almost breached the topic of her long departure. Am I supposed to make something of it, or just brush it off? Eventually settling on the latter, I nod. "That's fine. It's... what, three hours before dark? We can eat then, I suppose."
已经很久了。她差点就提到了，差点触及她长时间离开的话题。我是该就此做些什么，还是干脆忽略？最终我选择了后者，点了点头。"没问题。现在……离天黑还有三小时吧？我们那时候再吃，应该可以。"

"Sure." Carelessly tossing the package onto my pile, she frowns at her backpack. "Let's go through all of our stuff. We probably have some redundancy we could get rid of."
行。" 她随手把那包方便面扔回我的那堆东西里，皱着眉头看着她的背包。"我们把所有东西都检查一遍吧。可能有些重复的东西可以扔掉。

"Okay." Redundancy? Right now? Whatever. Shaking my head, I kneel down next to her backpack and unzip the thing. Inside it's overflowing with supplies, food and clothes and tools and such.
"好吧。"现在就重复？无所谓了。我摇摇头，跪在她背包旁，拉开拉链。里面塞满了各种物资，食物、衣物、工具等等，简直要溢出来了。

The next two hours pass surprisingly quickly. We're working together, close to each other, organizing stuff. There's little conversation, just a few half-sentences here and there as needed for our task, and I find that I'm studying her sideways an awful lot. She seems bossy, still, but I'm not entirely convinced; there isn't really much heat behind her words or mannerisms, not like there used to be, and I wonder if she's just falling into old patterns. I suppose I am too.
接下来的两个小时过得出奇地快。我们并肩工作，整理着东西。交谈不多，只有零星的半句话，按任务需要偶尔交流。我不由自主地频繁偷瞄她。她看起来依旧有些专横，但我并不完全确定；她的言辞和举止背后并没有太多锋芒，不像以前那样，我不禁怀疑她是否只是在重蹈覆辙。我想我也是。

Once we finish with that, I turn to the little propane heater and start a pot of water to boiling. Once it's ready, noodles and seasoning go in, and in minutes it's done. This presents a problem, though.
整理完毕后，我转向小煤气炉，开始烧水。水开后，放入面条和调料，不一会儿就煮好了。但这带来了一个问题。

"I don't have place settings," I admit, idly swirling the noodles in the pot. "So we'll have to eat from this thing, and one person at a time. You can go first."
我没有餐具，"我坦白道，漫不经心地搅动着锅里的面条。"所以我们只能从这个锅里吃，一次一个人。你先来吧。

Asuka lifts her eyebrows at this, perhaps deciding whether to dispute my decision-making ability, but after a moment she shrugs and swipes the pot from my hands. For a time she slurps and eats before passing it back to me, and then I slurp and eat.
明日香对此挑了挑眉，或许在考虑是否要质疑我的决策能力，但片刻后她耸了耸肩，从我手中夺过锅子。她先是一阵吸溜吸溜地吃着，然后递回给我，我也跟着吸溜吸溜地吃起来。

Afterwards, while I'm rinsing the pot out with lukewarm water, Asuka hugs knees to her chest and stares off over the ridge. "Shinji?"
之后，当我用温水冲洗锅子时，明日香将膝盖抱在胸前，目光越过山脊凝视远方。"真嗣？"

"Hmm?" I might have cooked the stuff for too long, because some of the sauce has burnt to the inside of the pan. A bit of scraping with a fingernail gets it off.
"嗯？" 我可能煮得太久了，因为有些酱汁已经烧焦粘在了锅底。用指甲轻轻刮一下就能弄掉。

"I'd like a fire." 我想生个火。

I blink up at her for a moment, but she's not paying attention to me at all. "Fine," I agree. "You can finish cleaning this, then." The pot plops to the dirt beside her.
我抬头朝她眨了眨眼，但她根本没注意到我。"好吧，"我同意道，"那你继续清理这个吧。"锅子咚的一声落在她旁边的泥土上。

"Fine." 好吧。

Shaking my head, I stand and head to my tarp-covered pile of firewood. It's getting a little low; I'll have to get some more, soon. After grabbing an armful and then toeing the tarp back into place, I make my way back to the makeshift firepit I've been using and dump the wood on the ground next to it.
我摇摇头，站起身走向那堆用防水布盖着的柴火。柴火已经有点少了；我得尽快再弄些来。我抱起一捆柴火，然后用脚把防水布重新盖好，接着走回我一直在用的临时火坑，把木头倒在它旁边。

Asuka watches blankly as I rip more pages out of the books we once read, but she doesn't try to stop me. Shortly a pile of them are burning, courtesy of the lighter I picked up a while back, and an armful of twigs and sticks goes on top. The burning paper quickly makes the kindling catch, and in moments I carefully place a pair of split chunks of dry pine over it all. This is a skill I've gotten fairly good at recently.
明日香面无表情地看着我撕下我们曾读过的书页，但她并没有试图阻止我。不久，一堆书页在打火机的点燃下燃烧起来，这是我之前捡到的，随后我又添上了一抱树枝和木棍。燃烧的纸张迅速让引火物点燃，片刻后，我小心翼翼地将两块劈开的干松木放在上面。这项技能我最近已经相当熟练了。

Once the fire is going, I claim a seat on the other side of it from Asuka. She still hasn't said anything since I started making it.
火生起来后，我在篝火的另一侧找了个位置坐下。自从我开始生火以来，明日香一直没说过话。

Really, the silence is frustrating, almost painful. There's so much we could talk about, so much I could ask her. What the hell has she been up to lately? Why did she come back? For that matter, why did she leave at all? How should I act around her now? Should I be addressing the Asuka from before Third Impact, the Asuka from just after, or the Asuka who stole into my blankets to sleep next to me, who I could swear was caressing my arm once on that second night? I don't get it. I don't fucking get it at all. It's always something new with her.
说真的，这沉默令人烦躁，甚至有些痛苦。我们有太多可以聊的，我有太多可以问她的。她最近到底在忙些什么？为什么她会回来？话说回来，她当初又为何离开？我现在应该如何与她相处？我是该称呼她为第三次冲击前的明日香，还是冲击后不久的明日香，亦或是那个悄悄钻进我的被窝，与我同眠，我敢肯定在第二晚曾轻抚我手臂的明日香？我搞不懂。我他妈的一点也搞不懂。她总是让人捉摸不透。

I'm still glad she's back, though.
尽管如此，我还是很高兴她回来了。

As I'm watching her, blue eyes flicker towards me, and I glance back out over the ridge. I guess I was staring. Why is she surprised? She's been here for a few hours and I still feel like I'm walking on eggshells.
当我注视着她时，她那蓝色的眼睛闪烁着朝我看了一眼，我随即又将目光投向山脊之外。看来我刚才是在盯着她看。她为何感到惊讶？她已经在这里待了几个小时，而我仍感觉自己如履薄冰。

Screw it. I have to say something. "So... you look good," I offer, nodding vaguely at her. "You must have been doing okay for yourself."
算了，我得说点什么。“那个……你看起来不错，”我开口道，含糊地朝她点了点头。“你一定过得挺好的。”

She blinks at me for a moment. "Oh! Umm, you look good too. I was thinking that earlier. Those sunglasses don't even suck." Frowning, she glances down at herself, fingering the bottom of her shirt, as though she's forgotten about me entirely.
她眨巴着眼睛看了我一会儿。“哦！嗯，你也挺好的。我之前就这么觉得。那副太阳镜也不赖。”她皱起眉头，低头看了看自己，手指捻着衣摆，仿佛完全忘了我的存在。

Sunglasses. Right; I'm still wearing them, even though it's almost dark. Quickly pulling the things from my face, I fold them up and toss them onto the pile of my bathing supplies. Now our bathing supplies.
太阳镜。对了；天都快黑了，我还戴着它们。我赶紧摘下眼镜，折好扔到一堆洗浴用品上。现在，那是我们的洗浴用品了。

Is she moving in with me? Why does this feel weirder than when we were just walking around together, before?
她要搬来和我住吗？为什么这感觉比我们之前只是四处走走还要奇怪？

I don't say anything more, though. The fire crackles happily away between us, though it may as well be an ocean for how easy it is to reach the other side. In the silence I chance another sideways glance, but she's still sitting there almost motionless. Firelight glitters on the A10 connectors still in her hair.
我没有再多说什么，尽管如此，篝火在我们之间欢快地噼啪作响，仿佛一道难以逾越的海洋。在沉默中，我再次偷偷瞥了她一眼，她依旧几乎一动不动地坐在那里。火光在她发间未摘的 A10 连接器上闪烁。

Eventually, when the last of the sunset glow disappears below the ridge behind us, I climb to my feet, aware of Asuka's eyes on me. Without trying to make eye contact, or make a big deal out of it, I find my toothbrush and toothpaste -- both of which she picked out for me -- and set about brushing my teeth. When I'm done, a little bit of water serves to rinse out the excess, and I spit what's left out over the ridge. She watches me the whole time, saying nothing.
终于，当最后一抹夕阳的余晖消失在我们身后的山脊下，我站起身来，感觉到明日香正注视着我。我没有试图与她对视，也没有大张旗鼓，只是找到了她为我挑选的牙刷和牙膏，开始刷牙。刷完后，我用一点水漱去多余的泡沫，然后将剩余的水吐向山脊。她全程注视着我，一言不发。

Only when I tug my shoes off and slip into my blankets does she unfold herself and move. For a moment I tense, wondering if she's going to sleep with me again, but she merely finds the sleeping bag she brought up here and starts unrolling it. Shortly we're both lying on our backs, once again separated by the crackling fire between us.
直到我脱下鞋子，钻进毯子里，她才舒展开身体，开始行动。有那么一刻，我紧张起来，猜想她是否会再次与我同眠，但她只是找到了她带上来的睡袋，开始展开。不久，我们俩都仰面躺下，再次被我们之间的噼啪作响的篝火隔开。

I swallow. "Hey, Asuka?" 我咽了咽口水，轻声唤道：“嘿，明日香？”

"Yeah?" Her voice is soft.
"嗯？" 她的声音很轻。

"You're... still wearing your A10 connectors. How come?" I swallow again after my question, wondering if this subject is out-of-bounds, but she doesn't explode at me.
"你... 还戴着 A10 连接器。为什么呢？" 我问完又咽了口口水，不知道这个话题是否越界了，但她并没有对我发火。

Instead, she simply lies there for a moment in silence. "Because I'm a pilot."
相反，她只是静静地躺在那里一会儿。"因为我是飞行员。"

I frown at this. "Umm... you're not, though."
我对此皱起了眉头。"呃... 你不是啊。"

"No, I know." She sighs. Between us, the fire pops, sending sparks flying up a column of hazy smoke. "I mean... I know I don't need them, but I like to show them off. Wearing them makes me feel elite." Her voice is still quiet, about as thoughtful as I've ever heard it. Probably as honest, too.
"不，我明白的。" 她叹了口气。我们之间，篝火噼啪作响，火星随着一缕朦胧的烟雾飞舞。"我的意思是...我知道我不需要它们，但我喜欢炫耀它们。戴上它们让我感觉自己很精英。" 她的声音依旧轻柔，这是我听过的她最深思熟虑的时候，或许也是最真诚的。

I nod against my pillow, uncertain how to respond. "It's just... who's going to see them? There's only me, and I already know you're good."
我靠在枕头上点了点头，不知该如何回应。"只是...谁会看到它们呢？这里只有我，而且我早就知道你很优秀。"

Silence. Leaves rustling, flames murmuring, sounds I've grown used to recently.
沉默。树叶沙沙作响，火焰低语，这些声音我最近已经习以为常。

Eventually she sighs again. "Well, people will be back eventually, right? And a person has to have some sort of identification."
最终她又叹了口气。"嗯，人们终究会回来的，对吧？而且一个人总得有点身份标识。"

I shake my head at this but keep my mouth shut. We've been over this. Maybe people will be back, and maybe they won't, but I wouldn't bet my future on it. It's already been almost a month and there's still nobody but us.
对此我只能摇头，却保持沉默。我们已经讨论过这个问题。或许人们会回来，或许不会，但我不会把未来押在这上面。已经快一个月了，除了我们，依旧空无一人。

When she doesn't add anything further either, I hug my blankets closer and roll to my side. Firelight dances in my eyes, but it's already burning down for the night, soon to be nothing but embers growing cold.
当她也没有再说什么时，我紧紧抱住毯子，翻身侧躺。火光在我眼中跳跃，但火势已逐渐减弱，即将化为冰冷的余烬。

Slowly my eyelids drift shut. Maybe everything has to burn out before it can start up again.
慢慢地，我的眼皮垂下。或许一切都要燃尽后才能重新开始。

### Chapter 10 Accelerando Giocosamente
欢快地加速

It's almost dawn. The air is crisp, even chilly; despite that, I'm still covered in sweat in the sleeping bag. The moon is getting to be full again, behind the red ring, and its angling light is a tangible thing now, illuminating our humble campsite like a faint silver spotlight in the heavens. One of the things it shows me is Shinji.
天快亮了。空气清新，甚至有些寒意；尽管如此，我在睡袋里还是出了一身汗。月亮又快圆了，藏在红色光环后，它斜射的光线如今变得触手可及，宛如天空中一道淡淡的银色聚光灯，照亮了我们简陋的营地。其中一样被它照亮的是真嗣。

He's still sleeping. I kind of expected him to look annoyed or something in his sleep again, but he doesn't. He just looks like a normal sleeping person. Unworried.
他还在睡。我本以为他睡觉时又会露出那种不悦或什么的表情，但他没有。他看起来就像一个普通的熟睡者。无忧无虑。

Something brushes skin near my left eye; blinking, I snap my hand back to my chest and curl it into a fist. I've been doing that lately, when I get thoughtful, trying to touch the scar around my eye. In a way it creeps me out, knowing it's there but being unable to feel anything, since the skin is still as smooth as it should be. If there's no mirror nearby, I can almost believe it's not scarred at all.
有什么东西轻触了我左眼附近的皮肤；眨眼间，我猛地将手缩回胸前，握成拳头。最近我常这样做，当陷入沉思时，试图触摸眼周的疤痕。某种程度上，这让我感到不安，知道它就在那里却感觉不到任何东西，因为皮肤依旧如常般光滑。如果没有镜子在旁，我几乎可以相信它根本没有留下疤痕。

After a moment I relax my fist and glance over at Shinji. He still hasn't awoken; my panicked reflexes must not have reached through whatever he's dreaming about.
过了一会儿，我松开拳头，瞥向真嗣。他仍未醒来；我那惊慌的反应想必未能穿透他梦境中的任何事物。

There's something different about him now, though. The moonlight painting his face in silver and black suggests a slightly different set of lines than were there before, though nothing physical has changed about him. Instead, it's more of his... bearing, I suppose. Maybe being forced to fend for himself, having no one to rely on, for almost a month has done something to him. Whatever it is, it's left his mark on him, a mark visible even in sleep, if subtly.
现在他似乎有些不同了。月光在他脸上绘出银黑交错的线条，与之前相比，似乎有了微妙的变化，尽管他的外表并无改变。这更多的是他的...姿态，我想。或许被迫自力更生，无人可依，近一个月的独立生活对他产生了某种影响。无论是什么，它已在他身上留下了痕迹，即便在睡梦中也隐约可见。

Or maybe I'm just making it up. Maybe I'm just comparing him to the cowardly Shinji in my head.
或者，也许这只是我的想象。也许我只是将他与脑海中那个怯懦的真嗣相比较。

In either case, last night wasn't as good as the other nights. Sleeping on this side of the firepit... it's not the same. Not as good as sleeping next to him.
无论如何，昨晚并不如其他夜晚那般美好。睡在火坑的这一侧...感觉不一样。不如睡在他身边来得舒适。

My God. I can't believe I'm just lying here, watching him sleep. Thinking about sleeping with him. It's like... like we're... yeah. Not a chance. He has some serious questions to answer.
天哪。我竟然就这样躺在这里，看着他入睡。想着与他同眠。这感觉就像...我们仿佛...是的。绝无可能。他还有许多重要的问题需要回答。

He might have been right, though. About the nerve connectors. Really, what am I trying to prove by wearing them now? He's right that there's no one to impress but him, and he knows my record as well as it can be known.
他或许是对的，关于神经连接器的事。说到底，我现在戴着它们是想证明什么呢？他说的没错，除了他，没人可取悦，而他对我记录的了解已经无人能及。

I snort at that. Maybe that is why I wear them.
我对此嗤之以鼻。或许这就是我戴着它们的原因。

In any case, though, they're useless. Nothing but ornamentation now. If I want to prove that he was wrong, that I've grown since Third Impact, the right thing to do would be to take them off.
无论如何，它们现在毫无用处，仅仅是装饰而已。如果我想证明他错了，证明我在第三次冲击后有所成长，正确的做法应该是摘掉它们。

Letting my eyes slide shut, I take a deep breath, then exhale slowly. Without looking I find the clips with my fingers, but there I pause unwillingly. They're smooth, cool to the touch, but almost like a part of me all the same; at the contact, I can feel it, the faintest whisper dancing along my spine, feedback from being touched by my own flesh.
我闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，然后缓缓呼出。我不看也能用手指找到那些夹子，但就在那里，我不情愿地停了下来。它们光滑、触感冰凉，却又几乎像是我的身体一部分；一接触，我就能感觉到，沿着脊椎最轻微的颤动，仿佛是我自己的肉体触碰时传来的微弱反馈。

Two tiny clicks is all it takes to unfasten them. They look almost like barrettes in the palm of my hand for the moment it takes me to shake off my reverie and stuff them into a pants pocket.
只需轻轻两下咔哒声，它们便解开了。在我手中，它们短暂地像是发夹，直到我从遐想中回过神来，将它们塞进裤兜。

I feel weird now. Like my head is naked.
现在我感觉怪怪的，仿佛脑袋光秃秃的。

But I have to remember that he was right. I'm not a pilot anymore. There are no pilots anymore. Chewing a lip, I frown at him, through him.
但我必须记住，他说得对。我不再是飞行员了，这个世界上也没有飞行员了。我咬着嘴唇，皱着眉头，目光穿透他，凝视着。

Some time later, as the eastern sky is growing pale, Shinji stirs, and my attention snaps back to him. As he smacks his lips, his face undergoes a series of random expressions, starting at confusion before shifting through boredom and irritation before drifting into... I think wistfulness.
过了一会儿，当天边泛起鱼肚白时，真嗣动了一下，我的注意力立刻回到他身上。他咂了咂嘴，脸上掠过一系列复杂的表情，从困惑开始，经过无聊和烦躁，最后似乎定格在一种...我想是怀旧的情绪上。

It's... kind of cute, really. Kind of funny. I've never watched anyone wake up before.
说真的，这还挺可爱的，也有点好笑。我以前从没看过别人醒来的样子。

When his eyes finally slide open, the first thing they do is snap over to me, as though he's afraid I'll have disappeared during the night. Or maybe hopeful that I've disappeared during the night.
当他终于睁开眼睛，第一件事就是迅速看向我，仿佛担心我会在夜里消失不见。又或许，他希望我已经在夜里消失了。

Long moments stretch into silence before it occurs to me that we're just staring at each other. Unease kicks in, triggering some reflexive behavior, and I scowl at him. "I'm going to go wash up and dress, perv. Try not to peek."
长时间的沉默蔓延开来，我才意识到我们只是在互相凝视。不安感涌上心头，引发了一些本能反应，我皱着眉头对他说：“我去洗漱换衣服了，变态，别偷看。”

When he just blinks at me, I rise, gather my things and set off into the trees. I wonder if he was even totally awake. I probably just made an idiot of myself for nothing.
他只是眨巴着眼睛看着我，我便起身收拾东西，向树林走去。我在想他是否真的完全醒了。我可能只是白白地让自己出丑了。

Maybe two hundred meters away from the campsite, I stop and frown back behind me, but the way is blocked; there are trees in every direction. He'd have to seek me out actively to see anything. Not like he would, though. Or would he? Maybe if he thought I wouldn't catch him. He seems like a very... opportunistic voyeur. I really need to call him out on that, but the moment has to be right. He can't be expecting it.
离营地或许两百米处，我停下脚步，皱眉回望身后，但视线被阻；四面八方都是树木。他若想窥见我，非得主动寻觅不可。不过，他应该不会这么做吧？或许，如果他认为我不会发现他，他就会。他看起来颇像个……机会主义的偷窥者。我真得找个时机戳穿他，但时机必须恰到好处，让他猝不及防。

Moving quickly, I strip down to my skin and scrub myself down with a damp washcloth. It's not a shower, but it'll do, and it's better than biking for three hours in the sun just to get clean. When dressing again afterwards, I pull on a different shirt, a poser-y thing meant to look like it came from Vienna. The walk back to the site is slightly easier than the walk out -- it's a little brighter now -- and when I get back, I toss our bath stuff into the pile devoted to it.
我迅速行动，脱得一丝不挂，用湿毛巾擦拭身体。虽非淋浴，却也足够，总好过顶着烈日骑行三小时只为清洁一番。重新穿衣时，我换上了一件看似来自维也纳的装腔作势的衬衫。返回营地的路比出来时略显轻松——此刻天色稍亮——回到营地后，我将洗浴用品扔进了专门堆放的那一堆里。

Shinji's now sitting up in his blankets, hair a mess, frowning out over the ridge, where a faint humid haze obscures the city in the early light. He eyes me briefly on my return, then pauses, obviously noting that my A10 connectors clips are missing. When, after a moment, his eyes slide back to my own, they're wide, a little uncertain. He doesn't know if he should make anything of it.
真嗣现在正坐在毯子里，头发凌乱，眉头紧锁地望向山脊那边，晨光中，一片淡淡的湿雾模糊了城市的轮廓。他瞥了我一眼，随即停顿，显然注意到我的 A10 连接扣不见了。片刻后，他的目光再次移回我的眼睛，眼神中带着些许不确定。他不知道是否该对此有所反应。

I take the choice from him by turning my back on him as I rummage through our food for breakfast. He's still watching me, though; I can feel his eyes on me, probably wondering how he possibly made me change my mind about something. And my head still feels naked.
我替他做了选择，背对着他开始翻找食物准备早餐。他仍在注视着我；我能感觉到他的目光，或许在纳闷他是如何让我改变了对某事的看法。而我的头依旧感觉空荡荡的。

Eventually, however, he climbs to his feet and claims the wet cleaning stuff I just used, then disappears into the trees. I start to shake my head before catching myself; at least now he's looking at my hair, not at my scar. Though... really I don't think I've caught him staring at that since I came here yesterday.
最终，他还是站起身来，拿走了我刚用过的湿清洁用品，然后消失在树林中。我本想摇头，却又及时止住；至少现在他是在看我的头发，而不是我的伤疤。不过……说真的，我觉得自从昨天我来到这里后，他就没有再盯着那伤疤看过。

When he gets back, I nod in greeting. "I was thinking. We could probably cut down a couple of these trees here, for some more room and a better view of the city."
当他回来时，我点头致意。“我在想，我们或许可以砍掉这里的一些树，这样能腾出更多空间，也能更好地看到城市。”

Shinji frowns cautiously at me as he puts away the bath stuff and grabs his cap instead. "Why?"
真嗣小心翼翼地皱着眉头看着我，一边收拾洗浴用品，一边抓起帽子。"为什么？"

I blink, then shrug. "I already said what it was for. If we're going to be here for a while, we should have room, don't you think?"
我眨了眨眼，然后耸耸肩。"我已经说过原因了。如果我们要在这里待上一段时间，难道不应该有个住处吗？"

He makes a face at this as he drops to the ground beside me. "I don't know. Actually... I was thinking about maybe making a... a permanent residence. Somewhere."
他对此做了个鬼脸，然后在我旁边坐下。"我不确定。其实...我在想，或许可以建一个...永久居所。在某个地方。"

"What? Why?" Twisting, I punch his knee to let him know what a good idea this is. "The city is full of houses, moron."
什么？为什么？" 我扭过身去，捶了一下他的膝盖，表示这是个好主意。"城里到处都是房子，笨蛋。

"Yeah, but they're other people's houses," he clarifies, scowling sideways at me. "And the infrastructure barely works anymore, anyway. When I was showering yesterday the water almost gave out on me."
是啊，但那是别人的房子，"他一边向我皱眉一边澄清道，"而且基础设施几乎都瘫痪了。昨天我洗澡时，水差点就停了。

I nod; I've experienced the same thing, and in any case there is a limit to how much we'll get out of the water supply with no electricity anywhere. Simple pressure has been sustaining us for now. "Well, even so, how well do you really think you could build a house? Seriously, we're two kids with no construction training or experience; maybe we could build something, and maybe not, but at least somebody else's house isn't likely to collapse around us while we sleep." Us. We. I keep including myself in this, don't I? Why not, though? I tried going it alone, and I saw how well that worked out.
我点头表示理解；我也遇到过类似情况，而且没有电力供应，我们的水资源终究有限。目前全靠水压勉强维持。"即便如此，你真觉得自己能建好一座房子吗？说真的，我们两个孩子既没建筑培训也没经验；或许能建点什么，或许不能，但至少睡在别人家的房子里，不太可能半夜被坍塌的房子埋了。"我们。我们。我不自觉地把自己也包括进去了，不是吗？为什么不呢？我试过独自一人，结果显而易见。

"Calm down, Asuka," he murmurs, idly wiping his sunglasses clean on the hem of his shirt. "I'm not saying we have to do this today. I was just throwing it out there as a possible goal in the future. So let's figure out what we want before we start hacking trees down."
冷静点，飞鸟，"他低声说道，漫不经心地用衬衫下摆擦拭着太阳镜。"我没说我们必须今天就动手。我只是提出一个未来可能的目标。所以在开始砍树之前，我们先弄清楚自己想要什么。

I find myself frowning at him and try to stop, but it's hard. What the hell happened to him? He's actually... unruffled. And worse, I find that his measured response actually did what he wanted it to: I've calmed down. But not because I'm placated; it's because I'm unbalanced, like he just gave me a shove and I'm still flailing arms around, trying not to fall.
我发现自己正对他皱眉，试图停止，但很难。他到底怎么了？他竟然...泰然自若。更糟的是，我发现他那有分寸的反应确实达到了他想要的效果：我平静下来了。但这并非因为我被安抚了；而是因为我感到失衡，就像他刚推了我一把，我还在挥舞着手臂，努力不让自己跌倒。

I don't like this. Not at all. Somehow control is shifting from me to him, and how the hell can I stop it if I don't know why it's happening? The worst part is that the idiot probably has no idea what he's doing to me. If I didn't need him, I wouldn't put up with this.
我不喜欢这样，一点也不。不知怎的，控制权正从我这里转移到他那里，如果我不知道为什么会发生这种情况，我又怎么能阻止它呢？最糟糕的是，那个傻瓜可能根本不知道他对我做了什么。如果我不需要他，我才不会忍受这些。

Tonight, then. I play the nuclear card tonight. First, though, he has to feel secure, has to feel like I'm under control and like we're not going to delve into our pasts anymore. "Fine," I sigh. "Let's just... whatever."
那就今晚吧。今晚我要打出核武器牌。不过，首先他得感到安全，得感觉我已被控制，感觉我们不会再深入探讨过去。"好吧，"我叹了口气。"我们就...随便吧。"

He grunts without looking at me, instead munching on a handful of dry cereal. After a moment I resume my own meal of canned nectarine segments.
他哼了一声，没有看我，而是继续嚼着一把干麦片。过了一会儿，我也继续吃我的罐头桃片。

Once we're done eating, I spare him a diffident sideways glance, then shake the empty can I'm still holding. "I thought we should get more stuff like this," I note quietly, not quite meeting his gaze. "Maybe a week's worth of food and water would be good. What do you think?"
吃完饭后，我怯生生地瞥了他一眼，然后摇了摇手里空空的罐头。“我觉得我们应该多准备些这样的东西，”我轻声说道，目光并未直视他，“或许准备一周的食物和水会比较好。你怎么看？”

Behind the sunglasses, Shinji's eyes widen in surprise at being consulted, let alone so meekly, and with effort I manage not to smirk at the ground. Eventually, though, he nods thoughtfully. "Yeah. That's a good idea, actually. Lets us worry about other stuff for a change."
透过太阳镜，真嗣的眼睛因被征询意见而惊讶地睁大，更别提还是如此温顺地。我费力地忍住不朝地面窃笑。最终，他若有所思地点了点头。“嗯，这确实是个好主意。这样我们就可以暂时不用担心这些了。”

Of course it's a good idea. I came up with it. "Also," I add, as though the thought just came to me, "some watertight containers wouldn't kill us either, for clothes and stuff."
当然是个好主意，这可是我想出来的。“另外，”我补充道，仿佛这个念头刚刚闪现，“防水容器对我们来说也不会是坏事，可以用来装衣服什么的。”

"True," he acknowledges. "Then we could... loot ahead, so to speak."
“有道理，”他认同道，“那样我们就可以……提前搜刮一番了。”

I smile at this description. And because the plan is working; he's getting more at ease. "Which do you want to get today, then? The food or the containers? I can get whichever one you don't."
我对着这个描述微笑。因为计划正在奏效；他越来越放松了。“那你今天想买什么？食物还是容器？我可以去买你不想买的那一样。”

He spares me a sidelong glance rendered unreadable by the shades. "We can probably find them both in the same store."
他透过墨镜给了我一个难以捉摸的侧目。“我们可能可以在同一家店里找到这两样东西。”

Oh? "True. Let me know when you want to go."
哦？“确实。你想去的时候告诉我一声。”

"I'm ready now," he shrugs, tucking away the cereal box and standing.
“我现在就可以走，”他耸耸肩，收好麦片盒站了起来。

With no reason to argue I nod, brushing off my jeans as I rise as well. "Then let's go, jerkface."
既然没有理由争执，我便点头同意，同时拍了拍牛仔裤站起身来。"那就走吧，混蛋脸。"

I can hear his low chuckle from behind me as we head out towards the road, and find myself smiling. I have to be sort of a bitch to him, at least, or else he'll get suspicious.
我们朝大路走去时，我能听到身后他低沉的笑声，发现自己也不禁微笑。我得对他有点刻薄，至少这样，否则他会起疑心。

As we find our bikes and start coasting down the long hill, I feel almost... pleased. It's kind of nice, actually, to do this ride in the daylight. And not alone. The water glittering off below us is actually kind of pretty, even with the stupid color and Rei's stupid half-head in the middle.
当我们找到自行车，开始沿着长长的斜坡滑行时，我几乎感到...愉悦。其实，在白天骑这段路还挺不错的。而且不是独自一人。下方闪烁的水面其实挺美的，尽管颜色有点蠢，中间还夹杂着 Rei 那半张蠢脸。

We don't speak much on the way down. Every now and then I veer my bike towards Shinji's, though, trying to freak him out, but all it does is make him laugh.
下坡的路上我们没怎么交谈。时不时地，我会把自行车偏向真嗣那边，试图吓唬他，但结果只是让他笑得更欢。

Before long we're rolling into the parking lot of the closest grocery store to the campsite. The doors have long since been smashed -- I think by him -- so the faint odor of rotten organics wrinkles my nose from fifty paces away. This isn't going to be fun.
不久，我们驶入了离露营地最近的杂货店停车场。店门早已被砸坏——我想是他干的——因此，从五十步开外就能闻到腐烂有机物的淡淡臭味，让我的鼻子不由得皱了起来。这不会是什么愉快的经历。

In the parking spaces closest to the doors, Shinji brakes to a lazy halt and flips his kickstand down. I do the same a short distance away, frowning at the store entrance as I slip to the pavement.
在离店门最近的停车位上，真嗣懒洋洋地停下车，放下脚撑。我在稍远处也照做，一边皱眉看着商店入口，一边踏上柏油路面。

Almost instantly, as he's tugging his sunglasses off, he throws me a sideways half-grin. "Remember where we parked."
他几乎立刻就摘下太阳镜，朝我投来一个侧面的半笑。“记住我们停车的位置。”

I lift a pained and skeptical eyebrow at this. Really? So lame. Though it helps my plan, that he's making jokes.
对此，我挑起一边痛苦的怀疑眉头。真的吗？太老套了。不过，他开玩笑倒是有助于我的计划。

Shortly the smile fades from his face, to be replaced by apparent indifference. With a shrug he continues on into the store, flashlight at the ready, shirt quickly pulled over his mouth and nose against the nauseating stench of rot.
不久，笑容从他脸上消退，取而代之的是明显的漠然。他耸了耸肩，继续走进商店，手电筒准备就绪，衬衫迅速拉过口鼻，以抵御那令人作呕的腐烂气味。

I follow a step behind, slowing almost to a stop as we approach. It's going to be awful in there, but my shirt's not long enough to serve as a filter without baring a section of my stomach, and I don't want him to see the scars there yet. I... didn't think of this beforehand; it's not something I had to worry about when I was alone.
我紧随其后，当我们接近时，我几乎停下了脚步。里面肯定会很糟糕，但我的衬衫不够长，无法充当过滤器而不露出腹部的一部分，我还不想让他看到那里的伤疤。我……事先没想到这一点；独自一人时，我从未为此担心过。

A few steps into the store, he pauses, then turns back at me, eyebrows drawn in concern. "Aren't you going to cover your mouth or anything?" His words are only slightly muffled by his own shirt.
刚进商店几步，他停了下来，然后回头看向我，眉头紧锁，显得担忧。“你不打算遮住嘴巴什么的吗？”他的话因自己的衬衫而略显含糊。

"For this? Are you kidding? I have a cast-iron stomach." Eyeing him in narrow scorn, I stride past him into the store, flicking on my own flashlight in the process.
“为了这个？开玩笑吧？我可是铁胃。”我眯着眼轻蔑地看了他一眼，大步超过他走进商店，同时打开了我的手电筒。

Gah. That's... gah. I shouldn't have opened my mouth in here. I feel strongly compelled to spit out the taste of death, but... not with him watching.
哎呀，这...哎呀。我真不该在这里开口。我强烈地想要吐掉这股死亡的味道，但是...不能在他注视下这么做。

"I'll find the food," he volunteers after a moment, when I don't say anything, "if you want to get the containers and some water."
“我去拿食物，”他过了一会儿主动说道，见我没吭声，“如果你想的话，可以拿些容器和水。”

Nodding, I angle towards the back corner of the store; hopefully the extra distance from produce and such will thin out the smell somewhat. Although, as I quickly find out, this turns out not to be the case. God damn it.
我点点头，朝着商店的后角走去；希望离那些生鲜食品远一点，气味能稍微淡些。然而，我很快就发现这并非如此。该死。

Thus, holding my breath and moving as fast as I can, I grab an armful of plastic containers that'll probably hold a few garments each, as well as a handful of sealing bags I imagine will come in handy at some point. Then, while Shinji's light is still wandering around in the canned goods, I hurry back outside, grabbing some water bottles from an endcap en route.
于是，我屏住呼吸，尽可能快地行动，抓起一抱塑料容器，每个大概能装几件衣服，还有一把密封袋，我想总会有用得着的时候。然后，趁着真嗣的光还在罐头食品区晃悠，我急忙回到外面，途中从货架端头顺手拿了些水瓶。

Once on the safety of the sidewalk, I slump against the side of the building and squeeze my eyes shut. I know it still smells terrible out here, but compared to inside it's like roses and rainbows. I... think I'm going to be sick.
一踏上安全的人行道，我便瘫靠在建筑物旁，紧闭双眼。我知道外面依然恶臭难闻，但与里面相比，简直像是玫瑰与彩虹。我……觉得我要吐了。

Soon, however, footsteps on broken glass jerk me back upright. Shinji emerges a few seconds later, grimacing as he elbows his shirt back down into place. "That's... pretty rank," he admits, muttering, before his gaze finds me. "You okay? You look pale."
然而不久，碎玻璃上的脚步声又将我拉回现实。几秒钟后，真嗣走了出来，一边皱眉一边将衬衫拉回原位。“那儿……真是臭气熏天，”他嘟囔着承认，随后目光落在我身上，“你还好吗？你看起来脸色苍白。”

"I'm fine." If I'd just told him about the scars before, this wouldn't have been a problem. Sometimes I just want to smack myself. But on the other hand, I'm still not going to show him. Not yet. Maybe not ever. We'll see.
“我没事。”如果我之前就告诉他那些伤疤的事，就不会有这个问题了。有时候我真想给自己一巴掌。但另一方面，我还是不打算给他看。至少现在不。也许永远都不会。走着瞧吧。

"Fine. Let's go back." Shaking his head and coughing, he makes for the bikes.
“好吧，我们回去。”他摇着头，咳嗽着走向自行车。

I follow, trying to ignore the vague lightness in my head. "Hey," I call. "Before we go, we should figure something out for water."
我紧随其后，试图忽略头中那股隐约的轻飘感。“嘿，”我喊道，“出发前，我们得想办法解决水源问题。”

He pauses, awkwardly repositioning the supplies in his arms to unzip the backpack sitting next to his bike. "What about water? You want to get more? I'd rather get it from a different store, though."
他停下脚步，尴尬地调整着怀中的物资，以便腾出手来拉开自行车旁背包的拉链。“水源怎么了？你想再弄点吗？不过我宁愿换家店买。”

"No, it's... well, that wouldn't hurt," I shrug. "That's not what I meant, though. We need to get a way to make our own water."
“不，不是那个意思...嗯，多备点也无妨，”我耸耸肩，“但我想说的不是这个。我们需要找到自制水源的方法。”

"Make it?" Startled blue eyes glance up at me for a moment before he resumes stuffing things into the backpack. "I didn't think you could make water."
“自制？”他惊讶地抬头看了我一眼，随即又继续往背包里塞东西。“我没想到水还能自制。”

I roll my eyes at this, jamming the damn plastic stuff I picked up into my own backpack. "You don't, moron, unless you mean by burning hydrogen. Didn't you ever pay attention in school? No, since we can't live on bottled water forever, I was thinking of making our own desalination setup. Except this would remove LCL too, not just salt."
我对此翻了个白眼，把捡来的那堆破塑料玩意儿塞进自己的背包。“你不懂，傻瓜，除非你说的是燃烧氢气。你上学时没好好听讲吗？不，既然我们不能靠瓶装水过一辈子，我考虑自制一个海水淡化装置。不过这也能去除 LCL，不只是盐分。”

Shinji pauses again, then slowly straightens and frowns at me. A breeze ruffles his short hair while the silence stretches. "Aren't those expensive? I remember the teacher mentioning that at one point. Water was a big issue after Second Impact."
真嗣再次停顿，然后缓缓挺直身子，皱眉看着我。一阵微风吹乱了他的短发，沉默在空气中蔓延。“那些不是挺贵的吗？我记得老师曾经提过。第二次冲击后，水资源成了大问题。”

I blink at this, vaguely surprised he would remember such a thing, then shrug it off and climb onto my bike. "Yeah. But we don't need to produce it for the whole city. We just need to boil -- can we start moving now? I'm dying here -- just need to boil and condense enough for the two of us." As we take off biking, the breeze dispels the smell of corruption and I can't help but smile.
我眨了眨眼，对他能记得这种事略感惊讶，随即耸耸肩，跨上自行车。“是啊。但我们不需要为整个城市生产淡水。我们只需煮沸——现在能出发了吗？我快热死了——只需煮沸并冷凝足够我们俩用的量。”当我们骑车出发时，微风驱散了腐臭味，我不禁露出了微笑。

"Could we even do that?" wonders Shinji loudly as we angle across a graffiti-strewn intersection. "How hard would it be?"
“我们真能做到吗？”真嗣在我们穿过一个涂鸦遍布的十字路口时大声问道。“那会有多难？”

"My degree is in physics, smartass. Of course I could do it." I pause, thinking. "The biggest pain would be getting rid of the crud left over after boiling each batch. And finding all the fuel to burn, I suppose. I don't know." Now that I talk about it, it seems like a lot of work. I was envisioning something like a school lab setup, if maybe a little larger, but now I think it'll take a little more planning. Probably not something we can do today.
"我的学位是物理学，自作聪明。我当然能做。" 我停顿了一下，思考着。"最大的麻烦可能是处理每批煮沸后剩下的杂质。还有，我想，找燃料来烧也是个问题。我不太清楚。" 现在一谈起来，似乎工作量挺大的。我原本设想的是类似学校实验室的配置，可能稍微大一点，但现在看来，得多花点心思规划。今天恐怕是做不成了。

"Is it something we can do today?"
今天我们能做吗？

I snort, then shake my head at Shinji's questioning glance. "Probably not. We'll think on it, though."
我嗤笑一声，然后对着真嗣询问的眼神摇了摇头。"大概不行。不过，我们会考虑的。"

"Like a house," he adds after a moment.
他顿了一下，补充道："就像建房子一样。"

I nod. Like a house.
我点了点头。就像一座房子。

The ride back up the hill elapses in a thoughtful silence. Or at least it's thoughtful on my part. What would I even need to get something like that going? If I can find sufficient liquid propane, or another suitable fuel, I could probably head down to the water and rig up a pump connected to a glorified boiler. Reverse osmosis would be ideal, of course, but that would be harder to set up. I need... I need to think.
返回山上的路程在沉思的静默中流逝。至少对我来说是如此。要启动那样的装置，我需要些什么呢？如果能找到足够的液态丙烷或其他合适的燃料，我或许可以前往水边，搭建一个连接到简易锅炉的泵。当然，反渗透是最理想的，但那会更难设置。我需要……我需要好好思考。

When we reach the ridge again, a detail on Shinji's bike finally catches my attention and I nod a question at him. "Hey. Didn't you have a GPS unit on there before?"
当我们再次到达山脊时，真嗣的自行车上的一个细节终于引起了我的注意，我向他点头示意询问。“嘿，你之前不是有个 GPS 装置在那儿吗？”

He gives me an odd look, and belatedly I realize this is almost taboo; I only noticed the thing there in the first place when he and I randomly met at the shoe store. Eventually, though, he just nods. "It ran out of battery power about a week ago," he explains. "Or else it just got tired of the LCL rain." Sunlight makes him squint as he speaks; he forgot to put his sunglasses back on, after the store.
他给了我一个奇怪的眼神，我这才意识到这几乎是个禁忌；我最初注意到那东西，是在鞋店偶然遇到他时。不过，最终他还是点了点头。“大约一周前就没电了，”他解释道，“或者它只是厌倦了 LCL 雨。”阳光让他眯起了眼睛；他在店里之后忘记把太阳镜戴回去了。

I nod in return, and together we leave the bikes totally unattended on a major highway. It still seems weird not to lock stuff up, but if there were enough people around to make theft worthwhile, we wouldn't have to be doing half this stuff in the first place.
我点头回应，随后我们一同将自行车完全弃置在一条主干道上。不锁东西依旧感觉怪异，但若周围人多到足以让偷窃有利可图，我们也不必一开始就做这些事。

It doesn't take long to fit our new supplies into the old ones, and when it's all done I estimate we have five or maybe six days' worth of stuff up here. It's not as much as I wanted, but it'll do.
没多久我们就把新补给整合进了旧物资中，整理完毕后我估摸着这里能撑五到六天。虽未达预期，但也足够了。

Another thing we have in abundance is trash. "Hey, idiot."
我们这里还有一样东西多得是——垃圾。“嘿，傻瓜。”

"Yeah?" He's stretching idly a short distance away, arms raised skyward.
“怎么了？”他在不远处懒洋洋地伸展着，双臂高举向天。

"What have you been doing with all your garbage and empty bottles and stuff?"
你那些垃圾、空瓶子什么的，都怎么处理了？

He shrugs, then claims a seat on the ground while he roots through the food pile. "Sometimes I just throw it over the ridge. Sometimes I let it pile up, then take it with me to the city and drop it in someone's bin. Why?"
他耸了耸肩，然后在地上一屁股坐下，开始在食物堆里翻找。"有时候我就直接扔到山脊那边去。有时候就让它堆着，然后带去城里，丢进别人的垃圾桶。怎么了？"

"We should get a routine going for it," I decide. "We can't just throw crap around and let it sit there." No, wait; I'm trying to be more docile. "Or... did you have another plan? If so, I'm willing to hear it."
我们应该定个规矩来处理这些。"我决定道。"我们不能就这么乱扔东西，任由它们堆在那儿。"等等，不对；我正试着变得温顺些。"或者……你是不是有别的打算？如果有的话，我愿意听听。

He jerks in surprise at my mild tone, then eyes me sharply for a moment. "Umm... no, I... I didn't really have a plan." He pauses, chewing a lip, frowning fiercely. "If you don't mind my saying so, Asuka, I... never really figured you were the environmental type."
他因我温和的语气而吃了一惊，随即目光锐利地盯了我一会儿。"呃……不，我……我其实没啥计划。"他停顿了一下，咬着嘴唇，眉头紧锁。"恕我直言，飞鸟，我……从没想过你是那种注重环保的人。"

"I don't really care one way or the other," I shrug. "But it rains blood now, Shinji; it's possible the ecosystem is a lost cause. On the other hand, though, I don't exactly want to live swimming in my own waste either. And with more people likely showing up it's bound to get even worse if we don't figure something out now."
我其实无所谓，"我耸耸肩。"但现在下的是血雨，真嗣；生态系统可能已经没救了。不过话说回来，我也不想生活在自己的垃圾堆里。而且随着更多人可能到来，如果我们现在不设法解决，情况只会更糟。

"People are..." His frown deepens almost into a scowl before clearing, and after a moment he simply shakes his head. Blue eyes slide absently to regard the city below. "Maybe. Yeah, I guess that's true. What did you have in mind?"
人们是……"他眉头紧锁，几乎要皱成一团，但随即又舒展开来，片刻后只是摇了摇头。蓝色的眼睛不经意地转向俯瞰城市。"也许吧。嗯，我想你说的没错。你有什么打算？

I hesitate a moment, just long enough to make myself seem indecisive. "Well... I don't know. We could just take occasional trips down to the city and drop all our trash off in existing bins, like you used to do. That was a good idea."
我犹豫了一下，故意显得犹豫不决。"嗯……我不太确定。我们可以偶尔去城里，把垃圾扔进现有的垃圾桶，就像你以前那样。那是个好主意。"

He twists slightly towards me, then actually smiles. "Thanks. Actually, I could do that now, if you want. Or, after eating." As though this reminds him he was looking for food, he resumes pawing through our food pile, shortly coming up with some vegetable drink and a little bag of chips.
他微微向我这边转了转，然后真的笑了。"谢谢。其实，如果你想的话，我现在就可以去做。或者，吃完饭再去。"仿佛这提醒了他正在找食物，他又开始翻找我们的食物堆，不久便找到了一些蔬菜饮料和一小袋薯片。

I nod, quickly finding some nuts and dried fruit for myself. I'd fucking kill for a steak right about now, though.
我点了点头，迅速为自己找了些坚果和干果。此刻我真他妈想吃块牛排。

"We're almost out of firewood," notes Shinji as we eat. "You want to chop more? Otherwise I can, and you can be on trash duty."
“我们的柴火快用完了，”真嗣边吃边说，“你想去砍柴吗？不然我来砍，你负责倒垃圾。”

There he is, taking control again. I try to keep my discomfiture to myself as I nod again. "I can do the wood." Axes are cool anyway.
他又开始掌控局面了。我尽量掩饰自己的不适，再次点头，“我可以去砍柴。”反正斧头也挺酷的。

He says nothing, instead simply eating. I do likewise.
他没有说话，只是继续吃着。我也同样默默地吃着。

Shortly he rises and starts collecting discarded wrappers and empty bottles into a backpack, while I wander over to check out the axe. It's simple enough, but apparently sharp. It'll be interesting to use a real one.
不久他起身开始收集丢弃的包装纸和空瓶子，装进背包，而我则走过去查看那把斧头。它看起来简单却显然很锋利。用真斧头应该挺有意思的。

"I'll be back in a few hours," offers Shinji by way of farewell, hovering at the edge of the campsite.
“我几个小时后就回来。” 真嗣以此作为告别，在营地边缘徘徊。

"Have fun." Hefting the axe, I stride into the woods, in the direction where he once mentioned he'd downed a dead tree.
“玩得开心。” 我挥动斧头，大步走进树林，朝他曾提过的他砍倒枯树的方向走去。

Soon I find it, in a clearing maybe sixty meters from where we're now living. It's actually pretty here, I reflect; with trees all around and layers of multi-colored moss decorating the edge of rocks poking up through the soil, it's like something from a postcard. I've never really cared too much for natural beauty, but with the world so beaten and ugly now, I guess I have to enjoy what I can.
很快我就找到了那棵树，离我们现在住的地方大约六十米远的一片空地上。这里其实挺美的，我心想；四周树木环绕，层层叠叠的彩色苔藓装饰着从土壤中冒出的岩石边缘，宛如明信片上的风景。我以前对自然美景并不太在意，但如今世界如此破败丑陋，我想我得尽量享受眼前的美好。

I've never chopped wood before either, but it doesn't seem too hard: swing the axe until the pieces come apart. A few hours later I start carrying armfuls back to the depleted pile Shinji once made. By the time I'm done moving it, however, he still isn't back, so, bored, I start making a fire myself.
我以前也没劈过柴，但看起来并不太难：挥动斧头直到木块分开。几小时后，我开始把一抱抱的柴火搬回新二曾经堆得满满的柴堆。然而，当我搬完时，他仍未回来，无聊之下，我便自己动手生火。

It feels weird to rip up one of the books I helped to find, or which I just grabbed at random from the library, but it's not like we're using them for anything. When Shinji finally shuffles into the campsite, I have a crackling blaze prepared.
撕毁我帮忙找到的书，或是从图书馆随手抓来的书，感觉很奇怪，但我们确实没用它们做什么。当新二终于拖着脚步回到营地时，我已经准备好了一堆噼啪作响的篝火。

"Oh," he smiles; warm hues paint his face in the dusky twilight. "Good. I was afraid I'd have to make one."
“哦，”他微笑着，暖色调在黄昏中为他的脸庞上色。“太好了。我还担心得自己生火呢。”

"I'm resourceful," I point out. And I started a lot more than simple fires, earlier in the city.
“我很会想办法，”我指出。而且，在城市里的时候，我点燃的可不仅仅是简单的火堆。

He regards me briefly but settles down on the other side of the fire, tiredly pulling his baseball cap off. "How are your hands? Mine hurt, afterwards."
他短暂地看了我一眼，然后坐在火堆的另一边，疲惫地摘下棒球帽。“你的手怎么样？我的是事后疼。”

I shrug. "My hands are fine." It's my arms that hurt, and my back. I must have been chopping wrong, or maybe he's just stronger than I am. Studying him quickly out of the corners of my eyes, I try not to grunt. He probably doesn't even weigh all that much more than I do, but I suppose there's a portion of my body mass that has little purpose but to make me look hot, whereas slightly more of his can be used for physical labor.
我耸了耸肩。“我的手没事。”其实是我的胳膊和背疼。我一定是砍柴的姿势不对，或者他只是比我力气大。我用眼角余光快速打量他，尽量不发出呻吟。他可能并不比我重多少，但我想我的部分体重只是为了让我看起来好看，而他的稍微多一点可以用来干体力活。

Eventually I shake my head slightly. "If you want to cook something, I'll clean." Cleaning's easier than cooking, and the new Shinji isn't likely to do both for me.
最终我轻轻摇了摇头。“如果你想做饭，我来清理。”清理比做饭容易，而且新来的 Shinji 不太可能两样都替我做。

He smiles again. "Sure. Thanks." I wave aside his silly gratitude, and without speaking further he chooses a package of instant something from the pile and starts cooking.
他又笑了笑。“好的，谢谢。”我挥手拒绝了这愚蠢的感谢，他没再多说，从一堆东西中挑了一包速食食品开始烹饪。

This is... weird. I feel somehow domestic. I need him, though; I can't afford to be selfish and have him toss me out again. If only I actually liked him, too.
这感觉...真奇怪。我竟有种家的感觉。我需要他，尽管如此；我不能自私，让他再次把我赶出去。如果我也能真正喜欢他就好了。

He's chosen to cook instant noodles of some sort, with seasoning and sauce that don't smell much like the actual meal they're intended to represent, but it's food. We eat in silence. Afterwards, I clean up, also in silence, but at least the cleanup isn't hard; some hot water, and a couple of minutes with a sponge, and I'm done.
他选择了煮方便面，调料和酱料的味道与它们所代表的实际餐食相去甚远，但毕竟是食物。我们默默地吃着。饭后，我默默地收拾，至少这并不难；一些热水，几分钟用海绵擦拭，就完成了。

It's almost dark when I finish, with a purplish glow all that's left to remind us of the sunset. "It's pretty tonight," I observe, keeping my voice quiet.
当我收拾完时，天色已近全暗，只剩下一片紫色的余晖提醒我们日落的痕迹。“今晚很美，”我轻声说道。

"Yeah." He pauses, sitting with arms crossed over his knees, staring up at an angle. "I really like the evenings, now."
“嗯。”他停顿了一下，双臂交叉在膝盖上，仰头望着某个角度。“我现在真的很喜欢夜晚。”

I can't say I agree, but I keep my mouth shut. It's hard to enjoy the sight too much when there's a giant band of red souls orbiting the planet in plain view. It stays in the same place along the celestial equator, though, like a genuine planetary ring, rather than changing apparent places in the sky. The moon follows it, now. Idly I find myself wondering if it has mass; it probably does, if it's staying in a stable orbit like that. If so, having it up there probably slowed down the world's angular momentum a little bit. I bet the days are slightly longer now.
我虽不甚赞同，却也缄口不言。当一串巨大的红色灵魂带在眼前绕行星旋转时，实在难以尽情欣赏这景象。它沿着天球赤道固定不动，宛如真正的行星环，而非在天空中变换位置。如今，月亮也跟随其后。我漫不经心地思索，它是否具有质量；若能如此稳定地维持轨道，大概是有质量的。如果真是这样，它悬在那里或许让地球的自转角动量略有减缓。我猜，现在的一天可能稍稍变长了。

Sighing, I tear my eyes from the red streak and glance over at Shinji again, but he's just sitting there, apparently content to stargaze. He looks almost happy.
我叹了口气，将目光从那道红痕上移开，再次望向真嗣，但他只是静静坐着，似乎满足于仰望星空。他看起来几乎有些快乐。

I guess this is as good a time as any to go nuclear. "So," I murmur, inspecting my fingernails. "Do you always think about me when you jerk off, or just most of the time?"
我想，此刻正是挑明一切的好时机。"那么，"我低声说着，审视着自己的指甲，"你自慰时是不是总想着我，还是大部分时候？"

The stammering shock I expected to hear from him is strangely absent; a quick check shows me that he's still just staring at the sky, though now he's frowning. I try to keep a frown from my own face as the silence stretches.
意料中他结巴的震惊反应并未出现；快速瞥去，只见他依旧凝视着天空，只是眉头紧锁。我努力不让自己的脸上也显露出皱眉，任由沉默在空气中蔓延。

Eventually clothes rustle as he shifts. "What do you mean?" His voice is quiet, even guarded. As well it should be.
最终，随着他的移动，衣物发出了沙沙声。"你什么意思？"他的声音很轻，甚至带着戒备。理应如此。

"The hospital, Shinji. I know what you did. Remember?" We talked about this in Instrumentality... but maybe he figured I was already dead, and that he was just dreaming me.
"医院，真嗣。我知道你做了什么。记得吗？"我们在意识统一中谈过这件事...但或许他认为我已经死了，现在只是在梦中见到我。

He shrugs mildly. "Honestly? Probably half the time." Despite his flippant words, he's gotten even quieter, speaking barely above a whisper.
他轻描淡写地耸了耸肩。"说实话？大概有一半的时间吧。"尽管他的话语轻率，但他的声音变得更加低沉，几乎是在耳语。

I can no longer keep the puzzlement from my own face. "Oh? Who was it the rest of the time?"
我再也无法掩饰自己的困惑。"哦？那其余时间是谁呢？"

"You name her, I've thought of her," he sighs, leaning back on his hands now. "Rei, Misato. Hikari, sometimes. Girls in our class whose names I don't remember anymore. Celebrities." He shrugs.
"你给她起名字，我也在想她，"他叹息着，向后靠在手上。"零，美里。有时候是光，还有我们班上那些我已经记不清名字的女孩。还有名人。"他耸了耸肩。

Quickly I manage to sneak a narrow glance across the fire, and discover that his arms are actually shaking, if only slightly. So he is uncomfortable, only pretending otherwise. Good. He's putting up far too convincing of an illusion, though. I was hoping for mute shock, or maybe breathless apologies or even yelling and raging, but this... this isn't what I expected.
我迅速地偷瞄了一眼火堆对面，发现他的手臂其实正在微微颤抖。原来他感到不适，只是在假装镇定。很好。尽管他营造的假象太过逼真。我本期待着他会震惊无言，或是喘息着道歉，甚至是大发雷霆，但这种反应……出乎我的意料。

Well, shit. Maybe a little more prodding will push him off-balance. "Yeah? So the hospital thing, does that turn you on? IV feeds keeping me sedated? Is that your thing?" Strangely I feel a perverse joy at topping his fantasy list at fifty-ish percent; it means I beat Rei.
该死。或许再多刺激一下就能让他失衡。"是吗？那医院的事，让你兴奋吗？静脉注射让我昏迷不醒？那是你的癖好吗？"奇怪的是，我竟然有种变态的快感，因为我在他的幻想清单上占据了大约百分之五十的位置；这意味着我超过了零。

"Not usually," he admits, displaying far less shame than he should. "Usually it was other stuff."
不常是那样，"他承认道，表现出远少于应有的羞愧。"通常是其他的事情。

"Like what?" 比如说？

"Do you really want to know?"
你真的想知道吗？

"Try me." My words come out clipped. Bitten.
"试试看。" 我的话语短促而尖锐，像是被咬断的。

He sighs again. Between us, logs shift in the fire, sending a miniature blizzard of sparks skyward. "Normally it used to... depend on my mood. Towards you. Like, if we were getting along, then in my head we were... happy. You know... affectionate and everything. But if we'd been fighting, then I would dream about trying to... to... hurt you. Or smother you, sometimes, like with a pillow while we were doing it. Stuff like that."
他又叹了口气。在我们之间，木柴在火中翻动，激起一阵细小的火花暴风雪，直冲天际。"通常以前...取决于我的心情。对你。比如，如果我们相处得好，那么在我的想象中，我们就是...快乐的。你知道的...亲昵，诸如此类。但如果我们吵架了，我就会梦到试图...试图...伤害你。或者有时候想用枕头闷死你，就在我们亲热的时候。就是那种事。"

I swallow, uncertain how to react to this uninflected revelation. On the one hand... yeah, I get it; he had rape fantasies about me. Rape-murder, apparently. What a fucking creep. What a worthless human being. On the other hand, though... I... didn't realize I messed him up that much. That he took me that seriously. And somehow despite all of that he still dreamed about us being tender -- loving, unless I miss my guess -- and still stuck around to help me around after Third Impact.
我咽了咽口水，不知该如何回应这平淡无奇的坦白。一方面...是啊，我明白了；他对我有过强奸幻想。显然是强奸谋杀。真是个十足的变态。一个毫无价值的人。但另一方面，我...没想到我对他影响那么大。他竟然如此认真地看待我。尽管如此，他依然梦想着我们能温柔相待——除非我猜错了，是爱——而且在第三次冲击后，他仍然留下来帮助我。

I don't get him. This isn't good.
我真搞不懂他。这可不是什么好事。

Before I can frame another response, he speaks into the silence. "What about you, then?"
我还没来得及组织另一个回答，他就在沉默中开口了。"那你呢？"

I blink. "What?" 我眨了眨眼。"什么？"

He tilts his head slightly in my direction. "What do you think about when you do it?"
他微微向我这边侧了侧头。“你做那事的时候都在想些什么？”

Heat blossoms somewhere inside. "Stop dreaming. Girls don't have to do that stuff."
内心某处涌起一阵热意。“别做梦了。女孩子不需要做那种事。”

"Bullshit." I can hear the smile in his voice; he's laughing at me. "I know Misato used to, even when she had Kaji."
“胡说八道。”我能听出他声音中的笑意；他在嘲笑我。“我知道美里以前就做过，哪怕她和加持在一起的时候。”

At the latter name, ice slashes through the heat inside me, and I can't help but flinch. "Shinji, you shouldn't have done it. It was pretty fucking creepy, you know."
听到后者的名字，我内心的热意被冰冷划破，忍不住打了个寒颤。“真嗣，你不该那么做的。你知道吗，那真的很诡异。”

"You think I don't know that?" His voice is tight. "Look, it was a shitty thing to do, and I feel terrible and I'm sorry. While you were busy getting medicated out of your mind, I was paralyzed with guilt until just before Instrumentality started because of what I did. So it's not like I don't know."
你以为我不知道吗？" 他的声音紧绷。"听着，那事儿做得确实混账，我感到非常糟糕，也很抱歉。当你忙着用药把自己弄得神志不清时，我因为自己的所作所为，一直愧疚到几乎要开始‘工具性’之前。所以我并非不知情。

He's speaking loudly now, almost yelling, and part of me relaxes somewhat; this is better. But the rest of me bristles. "Well, just consider this my way of throwing it out there, Shinji. What am I supposed to do? Ignore it? It's a pretty fucking big elephant in the corner, if you ask me!"
他现在说话声音很大，几乎是在吼叫，我内心的一部分稍微放松了些；这样还好些。但其余部分却感到不悦。"好吧，就当这是我把它摆上台面的方式，真嗣。我该怎么办？视而不见吗？如果你问我，这可是个相当他妈的大象在角落里！"

"You know what? I don't even care! I'm trying to apologize, and if you're not going to accept it, there's not a whole lot I can do." Sighing, he leans forward again, rubbing his face. "Anyway, it's not like what you did was all that different."
你知道吗？我甚至不在乎了！我正在尝试道歉，如果你不打算接受，那我也没什么能做的了。" 他叹了口气，再次向前倾身，揉着脸。"再说，你所做的也没那么不同。

"What?" I have to pause at this, but even by his standards it doesn't make any sense. "What the hell are you talking about?"
什么？" 我听到这话不得不停顿，但即便以他的标准来看，这也毫无道理。"你到底在说什么鬼话？

"Earlier," he states tiredly. "Recently. When you were sleeping with me."
早些时候，" 他疲惫地说道。"最近。当你和我一起睡觉的时候。

"Oh, please." I surprise myself by laughing. "Don't even try to compare that to what you did, Shinji. You may as well have raped me."
哦，得了吧。" 我惊讶地发现自己笑了出来。"别拿那事和你做的比较，真嗣。你那行为简直跟强奸我没什么两样。

"But I didn't," he counters evenly. "And what you did was exactly the same: you used me, stole something from me to satisfy some need you had, and then you walked away afterwards. At least what I did to you didn't toy with your emotions."
但我没有，" 他平静地反驳。"而你做的完全一样：你利用了我，从我这里偷走了东西来满足你的某种需求，然后你就离开了。至少我对你的所作所为没有玩弄你的感情。

"Whatever. You enjoyed what I did."
随你怎么说。你享受了我所做的一切。

When he doesn't answer right away, I glance over, then blink. He's glaring at nothing, slowly crumpling his hat into a ball and unfolding it again. Idly I wonder if it's my neck he wishes his hands were around. In any case, though, he looks... hurt. And angry. Very angry.
他迟迟不作声，我瞥了一眼，随即眨了眨眼。他正对着虚空怒目而视，缓缓地将帽子捏成一团又展开。我漫不经心地想，他是否希望自己的双手正掐在我的脖子上。无论如何，他看起来……受了伤。而且愤怒。非常愤怒。

I guess... maybe I shouldn't have said that. And, in a way, he may have a point. "Shinji."
我想……或许我不该那么说。从某种角度看，他可能也有他的道理。“真嗣。”

"What now?" “又怎么了？”

I swallow an angry response, instead hugging knees to my chest. "I'll... let it go if you will."
我咽下愤怒的回应，转而抱紧双膝。“我……如果你也愿意，我们就此打住吧。”

Silence answers me, and I sigh. This wasn't how it was supposed to go, not with him snapping back at me, putting me on the defensive. But he's right. I knew it was wrong the first time I crept into his blankets to sleep with him. It was a silly, stupid thing to do, in retrospect, but I was so lonely, so desperate for human contact, and I needed him even if I was still too angry to say so. I wonder if he'd even believe me, now, if I told him that. Maybe that was even how he felt about me, too; in that case his masturbation just would have been... a surrogate for the tenderness he actually came to me looking for. I don't know.
寂静回应着我，我叹了口气。事情不该是这样的，不该是他反唇相讥，让我处于守势。但他是对的。我第一次悄悄钻进他的毯子与他共眠时，我就知道这是错的。回想起来，这真是愚蠢至极，但我太孤独了，迫切渴望人类的接触，即使我仍然愤怒得无法表达，我仍然需要他。我不知道如果我现在告诉他这些，他是否会相信。或许他对我也有同样的感觉；如果是这样，他的自慰可能只是……他真正寻求的温柔的替代品。我不清楚。

"Fine," he mutters, shaking his head. "That's... Asuka, I'm sorry."
“好吧，”他嘟囔着，摇了摇头。“那...明日香，对不起。”

"Don't worry about it." I'm not even sure what he's apologizing for. "It's... getting late, isn't it?" The words slip out before I'm even aware I'm saying them; if anything, it's even earlier than we went to bed last night.
“别放在心上。”我甚至不确定他在为什么道歉。“已经...很晚了，不是吗？”这些话在我意识到自己在说之前就溜了出来；如果说有什么不同的话，现在甚至比昨晚我们睡觉的时间还要早。

Shinji glances skyward and nods. "Yeah. Yeah, we, um... It's been a long day."
真嗣抬头望天，点了点头。“嗯。是啊，我们，呃...今天真是漫长。”

"Yeah." My arms still hurt, really, and I suspect they'll only be more sore tomorrow, and I can only imagine how he feels after riding up the hill twice in one day. Maybe some sleep isn't a bad idea.
"嗯。"我的胳膊还是疼得厉害，估计明天会更酸痛，而他一天之内骑上那座山两次，真不敢想象他现在的感受。或许睡一觉是个不错的主意。

Shortly he clambers to his feet and seeks his blankets a short distance away. After a moment I make a face then do the same, wriggling into my sleeping bag after kicking off my shoes and socks. Something's bothering me, though; something's not right.
不久，他爬起身，在不远处寻找自己的毯子。我愣了一会儿，也跟着起身，脱掉鞋袜后钻进睡袋。但心里总觉得不对劲，有种说不出的异样。

It's only after a half-hour lying in the darkness that it hits me. Shinji. Even though he was clearly in the wrong, he stood up to me. Successfully. And made me realize I was wrong too.
直到在黑暗中躺了半小时后，我才恍然大悟。是真嗣。尽管他明显理亏，却敢于直面我，并且成功让我意识到自己的错误。

He's not a wimp anymore.
他不再是那个懦弱的家伙了。

### Chapter 11 Adagietto Maestoso
极慢板庄严

A powerful sneeze sets my eyes to watering.
一个有力的喷嚏让我的眼睛开始流泪。

Grunting, blinking, I pull my sunglasses off to wipe at my eyes. It hasn't rained in a few days, and the constant sun and heat have left the world a little dusty. Every branch I slap out of my way, every hopeful little piece of undergrowth I step on, seems to leave a thousand tiny particles of unidentifiable plant matter floating in the bars of shifting sunlight. I'm not used to this kind of stuff; even with my shirt pulled over my nose and mouth again, it's still driving me nuts.
我咕哝着，眨着眼，摘下太阳镜擦拭眼睛。几天没下雨了，持续的阳光和高温让世界变得有些尘土飞扬。我每拍开一根树枝，每踩过一片充满希望的小灌木，似乎都会留下成千上万微小的、无法辨认的植物碎屑，在移动的阳光中飘浮。我不习惯这种环境；即使再次用衬衫遮住口鼻，它仍然让我抓狂。

Or maybe I'm just an idiot, and don't know I have allergies. Either way, I'm tired of this.
或许我只是个傻瓜，不知道自己有过敏症。不管怎样，我已经厌倦了这一切。

Sighing, I stop where I stand. Above, branches shift in the breeze, weaving shadows and sunlight across my face, reinforcing my mild headache. Trees stretch in every direction from where I stand, a motley and unbroken regiment of pine and yew and maple. I'm still in astonishment that this much wilderness can sit so close to Tokyo-3 and I had no idea it was here until I started living in it.
我叹了口气，停下脚步。头顶上，树枝在微风中摇曳，将阴影和阳光编织在我的脸上，加剧了我轻微的头痛。从我站立的地方望去，树木向四面八方伸展，是一片杂乱无章却连绵不断的松树、紫杉和枫树的军团。我仍然惊讶于如此广阔的荒野竟能紧邻东京-3，而我直到开始居住在这里之前，对此一无所知。

Shortly the breeze dies, and a thick silence returns, devoid even of animal noises. That's really starting to bother me; though I've seen insects and even some smaller animals, I've spotted nothing larger than a mouse the entire time I've been here. I'm hoping that Third Impact simply scared everything big away, and that it'll all come back eventually.
不久，微风止息，浓重的静谧再次降临，连动物的声响也荡然无存。这着实开始让我心烦意乱；尽管我见过昆虫，甚至一些小动物，但自打来到这里，我连比老鼠大的生物都没见过。我期望第三次冲击只是暂时吓跑了所有大型生物，它们终将回归。

A brief electronic crackle pierces the silence, followed by a tinny female voice. "You're an idiot. Over."
短暂的电子噼啪声划破寂静，紧接着传来一个尖细的女性嗓音：“你真是个傻瓜。完毕。”

I smile, idly palming the walkie-talkie from where it's clipped to my jeans, but I can't think of anything to say in response, so after a moment I fasten it back on. She's been doing that all day.
我微微一笑，漫不经心地从牛仔裤上别着的对讲机上抚过，却想不出任何回应的话，于是片刻后又将它扣回原位。她一整天都在这么做。

It was her idea to do this. Her idea to split up and explore the area, looking for better places for us to live long-term. I suppose that's a good sign, coming from her, but if I had any money I'd bet that she came up with it just to get some time alone from me. Time to think.
这是她的主意。她提议分开探索这片区域，寻找更适合我们长期居住的地方。我想，这从她口中说出来是个好兆头，但若我有钱，我会赌她提出这个想法只是为了从我身边抽身，独自静思片刻。

I can't believe she brought that up last night, the thing at the hospital. Well, I can, but I'm surprised it turned out like it did. I would guess she meant for it to be a beat-down session on me, not the cathartic dialogue it turned out to be. I'm still not entirely certain how I managed to turn the tables on her, but whatever I did, she seemed pretty subdued at the end. Pretty thoughtful. I actually felt bad for snapping at her, and really I still do, but it's nothing she didn't have coming. She was right to be furious for what I did to her, and in truth that's another thing I still feel awful about, but she lost the moral high ground when she started sleeping with me against my will.
真没想到她昨晚提起了医院的那件事。嗯，我能预料到，但结果出乎意料。我猜她本意是想对我进行一番责难，而非演变成那场宣泄式的对话。我仍不太确定自己是如何扭转局面的，但不管怎样，她最后显得相当沉默，似乎在深思。我确实为之前对她发火感到内疚，现在依然如此，但这也是她自找的。她对我所做的事感到愤怒是理所应当的，说实话，我对此也一直心怀愧疚，但她失去道德高地是在她违背我意愿与我发生关系之后。

She was right, though. I did enjoy it. I just wanted her to ask first, and be there in the morning.
不过她说的没错，我的确享受其中。我只是希望她能事先征得我的同意，并且早上能留在我身边。

Abruptly I blink, realizing I'm just standing in place, frowning at trees. Sighing, I spin in place, scanning the terrain here, but it's all the same as everywhere else. I've been looking for flat places, hoping to find a location in which it's a little easier to put something solid than where we're staying now, but I'm not sure why I'm even bothering. I doubt she'll want to move; she likes the "view" from our current site. The view of a graveyard. Maybe it lets her feel like there are more people around or something. I don't know.
我突然眨了眨眼，意识到自己只是站在原地，皱着眉头盯着树木。叹了口气，我原地转了一圈，扫视着这片地形，但这里和别处并无二致。我一直在寻找平坦的地方，希望能找到一个比我们现在住的地方更容易搭建坚固结构的位置，但我不确定自己为何还要费这个劲。我怀疑她不会想搬；她喜欢我们当前地点的“景色”。那片墓地的景色。或许这让她感觉周围有更多的人，或者别的什么。我不清楚。

Sighing, I turn back the way I came from, back towards the road and my parked bike, some distance out of sight. She's been so keen to mess with me all day that I can't avoid the temptation to do the same. Pulling the radio from my hip, I think for a moment, then thumb the talk button. "Hey, Asuka."
叹息一声，我转身沿着来时的路返回，朝着公路和我停放在远处视线之外的自行车走去。她一整天都那么热衷于捉弄我，让我忍不住也想如法炮制。我从腰间掏出无线电，思索片刻后按下了通话键。“嘿，明日香。”

Moments slip past as I trace my original path coming out here. My eyes water again, and my nose tingles, but I manage to hold off on another sneeze.
我沿着来时的路缓缓前行，时间悄然流逝。我的眼睛再次湿润，鼻子发痒，但我还是忍住了没有打喷嚏。

Shortly static crackles again. "The hell you want? Over."
不久，无线电里再次传来静电的噼啪声。“你到底想干嘛？完毕。”

Grinning, I keep walking, leaving her in silence. Sunlight dances in my eyes through the sunglasses but I keep my head lowered, hoping to shade most of it away with the cap.
我咧嘴笑着，继续前行，留下她一人在静默中。阳光透过太阳镜在我眼中跳跃，但我仍低着头，希望用帽子遮挡大部分光线。

"Out with it, jerk. Did you find something? Over."
快说，混蛋。你发现了什么吗？完毕。

Lifting the radio to my lips again, I push the button. "I don't know what you're talking about, Asuka. I didn't say anything."
再次将无线电举到唇边，我按下按钮。"我不明白你在说什么，明日香。我什么也没说。"

"That's it? You spent the whole day coming up with that? Weak, Shinji. Very weak. Over."
就这样？你花了一整天就想出这个？真弱，真嗣。非常弱。完毕。

With a chuckle I clip the thing back to my pants. I'm not as quick on my feet as she is, but that doesn't mean I can't bug her.
我轻笑一声，把那东西夹回裤子上。虽然我不如她敏捷，但这并不妨碍我逗她。

"And remember to use 'over' next time, genius. Otherwise I don't know when you're done. Over."
“记得下次用‘完毕’，天才。不然我不知道你什么时候说完。完毕。”

It's a solid ten-minute walk back to the road, and the whole time I find myself wondering why I came this far out in the first place. A good hundred meters or two should have been enough to tell me this wasn't what we wanted, but the plateau just kept going, and so did I.
走回大路得花上整整十分钟，一路上我都在想，当初为什么要走这么远。本来百来米就该让我明白这不是我们要找的，但那片高地似乎无边无际，我也只好继续前行。

When I finally get to my bike, a quick glance overhead tells me it's late afternoon already. I don't see a need to kill myself searching for a future home site, so with a shrug I climb onto the seat and head back down the hill. It was my job to search uphill from our spot, and hers to search downhill. I wonder how much searching she actually did.
当我终于走到自行车旁，抬头一瞥，已是午后时分。我觉得没必要为了寻找未来的家园而拼命，于是耸耸肩，跨上坐垫，开始下山。我的任务是向上游搜索，而她则负责下游。不知道她到底搜寻了多少。

Sure enough, on reaching the campsite I get a cool nod from Asuka, who's just lounging around. I return the gesture, letting my brows furrow significantly at her relaxed position.
果不其然，一到营地就收到了明日香那冷淡的点头致意，她正悠闲地躺着。我回以同样的动作，眉头微皱，对她那副悠哉的样子表示不满。

"Bite me," she murmurs, glancing out over the city. "I just got here. Did you find anything?"
咬我啊，"她低声说着，目光投向城市。"我刚到。你找到什么了吗？

"Nothing worthwhile." After a moment's indecision I drop to sit next to her. "You?"
没什么有价值的。"犹豫片刻后，我坐到她旁边。"你呢？

"Nothing." 啥也没有。

A likely story. I just nod again, though. Besides, she does smell like sweat; she's probably telling the truth.
听起来挺像那么回事的。我再次点了点头，毕竟，她身上的确有汗味，可能说的确实是真话。

Now that I think about it, I'm sweaty too. Idly tugging my cap off, I rub it tiredly over my face, then let it flop to the dirt in front of me. If this keeps up I'll probably need a new one soon.
现在想来，我自己也一身汗。我懒洋洋地摘下帽子，疲惫地用它擦了擦脸，然后让它掉落在面前的尘土中。照这样下去，我可能很快就需要一顶新帽子了。

Something to the side catches my attention and I glance in that direction, just in time to see Asuka look away. Pretending not to notice, I toe absently at the ground as though bored, but inside I'm starting to get a little confused. She was watching me like that once this morning, too, totally without expression, just after we got up, but I shrugged it off at the time. Now, though, I'm starting to wonder what's going through her head. She's probably trying to figure out how to trip me up next time or something.
旁边有什么东西吸引了我的注意，我朝那个方向瞥了一眼，正好看到飞鸟转过头去。我装作没注意到，无聊地用脚尖蹭着地面，但内心开始感到有些困惑。今天早上起床后不久，她也这样无表情地盯着我看了一次，当时我没太在意。现在，我开始好奇她心里在想些什么。她可能正琢磨着下次怎么让我出丑吧。

Let her. If she wants to hurt me, she will. I'm not going to live the whole rest of my life on guard around her.
随她去吧。如果她想伤害我，她会找到办法的。我可不想余生都对她提心吊胆。

"Hey." Her voice is quieter now, more gentle than the acid sarcasm she's been giving me all day. "You know how we have a bunch of extra food and water now, right?"
嘿。" 她的声音现在更轻柔了，比起整天对我冷嘲热讽的尖酸，此刻显得温和许多。"你知道我们现在有很多额外的食物和水，对吧？

"Yeah?" I eye her sideways, pulling off my sunglasses in the process. If I wear them too long, they feel like they're pinching my head.
"嗯？" 我斜眼瞥了她一眼，顺手摘下太阳镜。戴得太久，它们就像在夹着我的头似的。

Blue eyes meet my own without humor, like she's forcing herself to meet my gaze for some reason. "What would you think about finding, say... a truck, and moving a whole bunch of stuff up here at once? We'd be set for weeks. Probably months."
她的蓝眼睛毫无笑意地与我对视，仿佛出于某种原因强迫自己直视我的目光。"你觉得，如果我们找辆卡车，一次性把大量物资运上来怎么样？那样我们就能撑上好几个星期，甚至几个月。"

I ponder that, then give a shrugging nod. "I don't see why not." I'm still getting used to her asking my opinion on stuff. I'm not sure if she's doing it just for appearances or not. "Do we have to do it soon, though? We'll last a while without it, and I wouldn't mind having a day just to... just to chill, really."
我沉思片刻，然后耸了耸肩表示同意。"我看不出有什么不可以。" 我还在适应她征求我的意见。不确定她这么做只是为了表面功夫还是真心的。"但我们非得马上行动吗？没有这些，我们也能撑一段时间，我倒希望能有一天时间，就... 就放松一下，真的。"

Asuka blinks at this, and abruptly her face seems so very close to mine, closer than we've been since sleeping together; I could touch her birthmark if I wanted to. After a moment she glances away, shaking slightly, red hair fluffing with the motion, and it takes me a moment to realize she's laughing silently. "Just to chill?" she repeats. "What a slacker. We'll need playing cards or something first, though. I'm not just sitting here all day and staring at your ugly face."
明日香对此眨了眨眼，突然间她的脸庞显得离我如此之近，比我们同床共枕时还要近；我若愿意，甚至能触碰到她的胎记。片刻后，她移开目光，身体微微颤抖，随着动作，红色的发丝蓬松起来，我过了一会儿才意识到她正无声地笑着。“只是为了放松？”她重复道，“真是个懒虫。不过，我们得先有扑克牌什么的，我可不想一整天就坐这儿盯着你的丑脸。”

"Fine." I try not to frown, unsure if she's laughing at me or at her own ambition or what.
“好吧。”我努力不让自己皱眉，不确定她是在笑我，还是笑她自己的野心，或是别的什么。

As her laughter subsides, one of her fists collides with the meat of my shoulder, more pushing me than punching me. "Start cooking, stooge," she commands, but her voice is still quiet, still soft. "It'll be dark before long."
随着她的笑声渐渐平息，她的一只拳头轻轻撞在我肩膀的肉上，与其说是打，不如说是在推我。“开始做饭吧，傻瓜，”她命令道，但声音依旧轻柔。“天很快就要黑了。”

Shaking my head, I scoot over to our food supplies and do as she asks. This is starting to creep me out; it's like she's trying to be both nice and bitchy, to cover all the bases or something. Although... could it be that she herself doesn't know how to act around me now? Maybe that's what the weird looks have been for today. Why would she be that confused, though?
我摇摇头，挪到我们的食物储备旁，按她说的去做。这开始让我感到不安；她似乎在试图既表现得友好又刻薄，好像要涵盖所有方面似的。虽然...会不会是她自己也不知道该如何与我相处了？或许这就是今天那些奇怪眼神的原因。但她为何会如此困惑呢？

I cook quickly and without distraction, as Asuka seems lost in her own thoughts. It's pasta tonight, with freeze-dried peppers and a spicy oil sauce; though the finished meal has the consistency of wet cardboard, it doesn't actually taste too bad. Or maybe I'm just getting used to all the instant food.
我迅速且专注地烹饪着，而明日香似乎沉浸在自己的思绪中。今晚是意面，搭配冻干辣椒和香辣油酱；尽管成品的口感像湿纸板，但味道其实并不差。或许我只是习惯了这些速食。

Twilight starts rolling in as we eat, and I find myself studying Asuka as she in turn studies the rest of the world below. She's different now. I know I accused her of being the same, of not having learned anything, but I think I was mistaken. She's more... solid now, somehow, less shrill. And why wouldn't she be? She's the only person besides me to come back to the world, so she has to be strong. Else, like everyone else, she wouldn't be here at all.
我们用餐时，暮色开始降临，我不由自主地观察起明日香，她则凝视着下方世界的其余部分。她现在不同了。我知道我曾指责她一成不变，什么也没学到，但我想我错了。她现在更加……坚实，不那么尖锐了。她怎么会不这样呢？她是除我之外唯一回到这个世界的人，所以她必须坚强。否则，就像其他人一样，她根本不会在这里。

And I'm still glad she's here. She must finally be healing from all the stuff that hurt her so badly before Instrumentality, which is good in itself, but it also makes her... pleasant company. I actually enjoy spending time with her, bitter arguments included. At least we're arguing about honest stuff now, real issues, not meaningless kid stuff like who gets to take point in the next Angel attack. And at least she actually thinks now, can actually realize when she's wrong and back down in a reasonable manner.
我依然庆幸她在这里。她终于从统一体之前那些深深伤害她的事情中恢复过来，这本身是件好事，也让她变得……宜人相伴。我甚至享受与她共度的时光，包括那些激烈的争论。至少我们现在争论的是真实的问题，是实实在在的事情，而非像谁在下次天使攻击中负责前哨这样无意义的孩童争执。而且，至少她现在真的会思考了，能意识到自己的错误并以合理的方式退让。

I don't know if I'm wise now, or just foolish enough to think so, but I've grown too. Grown enough to recognize that I like her. As more than a friend.
我不知道自己现在是明智了，还是仅仅愚蠢到自以为如此，但我确实成长了。成长到足以认识到我喜欢她。超越了朋友的范畴。

What to do, though? Just sit like this, enjoying what I have? I'm not going to kid myself -- I do want more than this -- but I'm not at all certain I'm going to do anything about it. Maybe... maybe wait until she settles a bit, until she's at least not confused about how to behave around me. She's grown, but I doubt she could make up her mind with any clarity right now.
然而，该怎么办呢？就这样坐着，享受眼前的一切？我不会自欺欺人——我确实渴望更多——但我完全不确定自己是否会采取行动。或许……或许等到她更稳定一些，至少不再对我周围的行为感到困惑。她虽已成长，但我怀疑她此刻能否清晰地做出决定。

Something in the silence, or in my gaze on her, must catch her awareness because she pauses in mid-chew, then turns to frown at me. I twitch, but there's no backing out; she's caught me staring, fair and square. Shadowed blue eyes blink back at me, thoughtful, unafraid.
或许是寂静中的某种东西，或是我凝视她的目光，引起了她的注意，因为她咀嚼到一半突然停下，然后转过头来皱眉看着我。我一颤，但已经没有退路；她正大光明地抓到我在盯着她。那双隐约泛蓝的眼睛眨了眨，回望着我，沉思而无所畏惧。

And then she glances away, totally calm, as though nothing's happened. Ignoring me completely, she resumes chewing, resumes staring off over the dusk-cloaked city.
然后她移开视线，完全平静，仿佛什么都没发生。她完全无视我，继续咀嚼，继续凝视着暮色笼罩的城市。

I squeeze my eyes shut and try not to draw a ragged breath. Either I've already been shot down, or she's just playing calm now to blindside me with some comment about that look later. I'm probably screwed either way, and the sudden appetite-quenching swirl in my stomach would seem to agree.
我紧闭双眼，试图不让自己喘息。要么我已经彻底没戏，要么她现在只是故作镇定，准备稍后用关于那个眼神的评论给我一个措手不及。无论哪种情况，我可能都完蛋了，而胃里突然涌起的食欲消退感似乎也同意这一点。

Anyway, it wouldn't kill me to be nicer to her now, I suppose. Too much kindness and she'll probably think I'm being sycophantic, but a little here and there might get her to smile more, maybe. Not to mention I could apologize for being wrong about whether she's changed.
不管怎样，我想现在对她好一点也不会要了我的命。太过殷勤她可能会认为我在谄媚，但偶尔的一点点善意或许能让她笑得更多，或许吧。更不用说我应该为之前误判她是否有所改变而道歉。

I'm... nervous, I think. For the first time since Third Impact, I actually feel genuinely nervous, and my stomach is still swirling too much to let me want to eat at all. With a sigh I climb to my feet, aware of Asuka's eyes sliding to me, then shuffle a few steps to the ridge and dump the rest of my pasta out. I didn't have much left, at least.
我... 有点紧张，我想。自从第三次冲击以来，我第一次真正感到紧张，胃里翻江倒海，让我根本不想吃东西。叹了口气，我站起身来，感觉到明日香的目光滑向我，然后拖着步子走到山脊边，把剩下的意面倒掉。至少，剩下的不多了。

"You would do that?" she murmurs behind me. "Turn your back on me like that, so close to the edge?"
“你会这么做吗？”她在我身后低声说，“就这样背对着我，离边缘这么近？”

Lowering my makeshift dish -- one of the resealable plastic things -- to my side, I nod without turning around. "Yeah. Why not?"
我把手中的简易餐具——一个可封口的塑料容器——放低到身侧，没有回头地点了点头。“对，为什么不呢？”

"Two movements," she answers. "The first, a quick lunge in your direction, planting my knee on the ground. The second, throwing all my forward momentum into my arms for one... little... push."
“两个动作，”她回答，“第一，迅速向你冲去，膝盖着地。第二，将所有前冲的势头集中在手臂上，给你...轻轻...一推。”

Shrugging, I turn around and stare back at her, unimpressed. "You could kill me in my sleep, too," I point out. "Or by pushing me down the bluffs on my bike. What's the point in worrying? I trust you." She's just trying to mess with me again. In her mind this is probably a power struggle or something.
我耸了耸肩，转过身来，面无表情地回望着她。“你也可以趁我睡着时杀了我，”我指出，“或者把我从悬崖上连人带车推下去。担心有什么用？我相信你。”她又想捉弄我了。在她看来，这或许是一场权力游戏。

Red eyebrows climb at this, and she leans thoughtfully back against the log-bench. "Why?"
她红色的眉毛挑了起来，身体若有所思地向后靠在原木长凳上。“为什么？”

"I don't know. I've pissed you off a lot before, and I think if you were going to kill me, you'd have done it before this." Plus, if she were really intending to cause me serious harm, she wouldn't tell me about it beforehand. She's not an idiot.
“我不知道。我以前没少惹你生气，如果真要杀我，你早就动手了。”再者，如果她真打算对我下狠手，不会事先告诉我。她又不傻。

She doesn't answer, though, instead just watches me blandly like she's trying to seem dangerous. One finger scratches idly at an itch on her cheek.
她没有回答，只是淡然地盯着我，仿佛在试图显得危险。一只手指漫不经心地挠着脸颊上的痒处。

With another shrug I toss my bowl and chopsticks to the dirt in front of her. "You're cleaning up."
我再次耸了耸肩，将碗筷扔到她面前的地上。“你来收拾。”

Her brows draw sharply back down as she watches me reclaim my seat. Eventually, though, she chews a lip, then resumes eating without comment.
她眉头紧锁，看着我重新坐下。最终，她咬了咬嘴唇，然后默默地继续吃饭。

I wonder if something's wrong with me. I like a girl who makes casual death threats just to stir things up.
我在想，我是不是有点问题。我喜欢那种为了挑起事端而随意发出死亡威胁的女孩。

Whatever. "Do you want a fire?"
算了，“你要生火吗？”

She blinks at me, then nods once. "You've gotten pretty good at making them."
她朝我眨了眨眼，然后点了下头。“你做这个已经很熟练了。”

"I've had practice." Thankfully she makes no attempt to distract me as I find and start ripping pages from one of the books, and after a few moments she starts in on the dishes. I find I enjoy watching her work. It's not so much because I take pleasure in being able to force her to clean up, so much as I just... like watching her do stuff. Peaceful stuff.
“我练得多了。”幸好她没有试图打扰我，我找到一本书开始撕页，过了一会儿，她开始洗碗。我发现我喜欢看她干活。倒不是因为我喜欢强迫她做清洁，而是我……就是喜欢看她做事。做些平静的事。

Once the fire is going and the dishes are drying, I sprawl next to the firepit, leaning back on my hands. It looks like it's going to be a full moon tonight, or close to it; already it's a swollen peach-orange ball hovering just above the eastern horizon.
火生起来了，碗碟也在晾干，我便在火坑旁伸展开来，背靠双手。今晚似乎是满月，或者接近满月；月亮已经像一颗饱满的桃橙色球体，低悬在东方的地平线上。

To my surprise Asuka drops down beside me, on my side of the fire, a little closer than I would have expected her to sit. She doesn't seem to be paying any attention to me, though, instead just gazing sideways along the edge of the ridge.
令我惊讶的是，明日香在我身边坐了下来，就在火堆的这一侧，比我预想的要近一些。她似乎并没有注意到我，而是侧着头凝视着山脊边缘。

After a moment I return my attention to the sky. It's been so long since I've been around city lights now that I find I can barely remember how it used to look, before Third Impact. I know there were fewer stars then, since the light washed them out, but I can't really picture it in my head anymore. This is the new sky.
过了一会儿，我将目光重新投向天空。自从远离城市灯光以来，已经很久了，以至于我几乎记不起第三次冲击之前它是什么样子。我知道那时星星更少，因为光线掩盖了它们，但我现在脑海中已经无法清晰地描绘出那幅景象了。这是新的天空。

"Shinji?" 真嗣？

"Hmm?" Really, I wish I knew more of the constellation names. It seems like that's the stuff people are supposed to talk about around campfires. I bet Asuka knows them, though.
"嗯？" 说真的，我希望我能知道更多星座的名字。这似乎是人们在篝火旁应该谈论的话题。我敢打赌明日香知道它们。

"You know..." She trails off with a quiet sigh. Her voice is back to being soft, now. "You know, when I first came back, after being apart for so long... when I said you looked good... I meant that."
你知道的……" 她轻声叹息，话音渐弱。她的声音又变得柔和了。"你知道吗，当我第一次回来，分开那么久之后……当我说你看起来不错时……我是真心的。

Startled, I glance over at her with what's bound to be a bizarre expression on my face, but she's not even looking at me. Instead she's staring at her hands folded in her lap, lips thinned, face thoughtful. Her eyes cut towards me briefly before jerking back.
我惊得瞥了她一眼，脸上肯定挂着怪异的表情，但她压根没看我。她只是凝视着自己交叠在膝上的双手，嘴唇紧抿，面露沉思。她的目光短暂地扫向我，随即又迅速移开。

"Um..." I swallow. What the hell is this? In fifteen minutes we've moved from talking about murdering me to how I look good?
"呃..." 我咽了咽口水。这算什么情况？短短十五分钟，我们从讨论杀我到夸我好看？

"It's true, though," she insists, finally making eye contact, if only briefly. "You don't look like a dorky schoolboy anymore, and it's nice. I just... figured you should know."
但这是真的，" 她坚持道，终于短暂地与我目光相接。"你不再像个呆头呆脑的学生了，这样挺好的。我只是...觉得你应该知道。

"Thank you," I manage after a moment. I... think that's the first unsolicited nice thing she's ever said about me, the first compliment that wasn't backhanded or coupled with a much greater insult. Is it? I rack my brain briefly trying to think of another time she's done it, but I'm drawing a blank. "That's... good to know. Thank you."
谢谢，" 我过了一会儿才勉强回应。我想...这应该是她第一次主动对我说的赞美，第一次不是暗含讽刺或伴随更大侮辱的夸奖。是这样吗？我脑海中快速搜索，试图想起她以前是否也有过类似举动，却一无所获。"这...挺好的。谢谢你。

She nods a little stiffly, then shifts vaguely about without actually moving. "I just... yeah. You know."
她略显僵硬地点了点头，随后身体微微晃动，却并未真正移动。“我就是……嗯，你懂的。”

I'm still staring at her despite her obvious discomfort. What is this? Is this just another way of pushing me, of tugging on my strings to find out which ones move me? She seems honest, though, and I don't think she's a good enough actor to fake this kind of unease.
尽管她明显感到不适，我仍旧盯着她。这是怎么回事？这是否又是另一种推动我的方式，试图拉动我的某根心弦以探知我的反应？然而，她看起来很真诚，我不认为她有足够的演技来伪装这种不安。

So. Maybe the compliment was intended to manipulate me somehow, but she meant it. I don't get it. She's acting like... like she's sticking her neck out, and has yet to walk away unscathed. Is she afraid I'll come back with some barb or cheap shot? What, compliments from Asuka? Is the world ending again? Hahahaha!
所以，或许那句赞美本意是为了操纵我，但她确实是真心的。我不明白。她的行为就像……像是在冒险，而且尚未全身而退。她是在害怕我会反唇相讥或给予低劣的反击吗？什么，来自明日香的赞美？难道世界又要末日了吗？哈哈哈！

Once again her eyes slide in my direction. "You're... uh, staring, Shinji." Her tone is flat, and the firelight paints her face in warm flickering orange, nearly concealing the birthmark.
她的目光再次向我这边滑来。“你……呃，在盯着我看，真嗣。”她的语气平淡，火光在她脸上绘出温暖跳跃的橙色，几乎遮住了那块胎记。

"Sorry." I shake my head. She needs more than a 'thank you' for that. "Hey."
对不起。" 我摇了摇头。她需要的远不止一句“谢谢”。"嘿。

"Mmm?" 嗯？

I take a deep breath, then exhale sharply. "I want to apologize. I mean... for what I said earlier, right before you ran off. About not... not learning, or changing. I think you have, but I must not have seen it or something, so... I was wrong. I'm sorry."
我深吸一口气，然后用力呼出。"我想道歉。我是说... 对于我之前说的那些话，就在你跑开之前。关于你没有... 没有学习，或者改变。我想你已经改变了，只是我没看到或者怎样，所以... 我错了。对不起。"

Slowly she raises her eyes to meet mine, then makes as if to look away before double-taking back. There's no pretense at the moment, no false impression she's trying to convey, nothing I'm trying to hide from her; I'm just saying what I mean, and she's reading the confirmation on my face with sharp eyes that twitch from time to time as she studies me.
她缓缓抬起眼眸与我对视，随即似乎要移开视线，却又猛地转回。此刻没有伪装，没有她试图传达的虚假印象，也没有我试图对她隐瞒的；我只是坦诚表达，而她正用那双不时抽动的敏锐眼睛，从我的脸上读取确认。

Long moments pass in silence. For some reason it's much easier to meet her gaze than it used to be.
长久的沉默流逝。不知为何，与她对视变得比以往容易许多。

Eventually she gives me a thoughtful nod, then stares out over the abandoned city. Far beyond her, the moon is now high enough that it looks silver again, undistorted by the horizon if still crossed through with red.
她最终向我投来一个深思的点头，随后凝视着那座废弃的城市。在她视线之外，月亮已升得足够高，再次呈现出银色，不再被地平线扭曲，尽管仍被红色条纹贯穿。

Huh. She didn't explode at me, at least. I suppose a nod is better than nothing.
哈，至少她没有对我发火。我想，一个点头总比什么都没有强。

Adjusting my seat on the ground, I shake my head again and frown back up at the glittering heavens. I wonder if the belt of crimson slashing through the blackness, intersecting the moon, will ever go away. If not, that's part of the moon we'll just never see again, the part behind it, forever hidden as it rides the ring of souls like some sick celestial monorail.
我调整了一下坐在地上的姿势，再次摇头，皱眉望向闪烁的星空。我好奇那道划破黑暗的猩红带子，与月亮交错，是否会永远消失。如果不，那将是月亮我们再也看不到的一部分，它背后的部分，永远隐藏，如同乘坐着病态的天体单轨列车，沿着灵魂之环运行。

"Hey, jerk." 嘿，混蛋。

Ah, we're back to the taunting voice. Here it comes. "Yeah?"
啊，又是那嘲讽的声音。来了。"嗯？"

"You remember what they look like, don't you?"
你还记得他们长什么样吧，不是吗？

I hesitate, uncertain how to interpret this, until finally I glance a question at Asuka. She's still staring at her lap, though now her hair is hanging to obscure her face. "Remember who?"
我犹豫着，不知该如何理解这话，最终我向明日香投去一个疑问的眼神。她依旧盯着膝盖，只是现在头发垂下来遮住了脸。"记得谁？"

By way of answer she reaches up to cup her own breasts, even squeezing them briefly through her shirt. "These. You'd probably never forget, would you?"
她以行动作答，伸手隔着衬衫轻握自己的双乳，甚至短暂地捏了捏。“这些。你大概永远也忘不了，对吧？”

No way in hell. I wish I hadn't seen them, though, not like how it actually happened.
绝无可能。但我宁愿从未见过，至少不是以那种方式。

When I don't answer, she pauses, hands still on her chest, then glances up at me. Her eyes are hooded, still partially hidden by unruly locks of reddish hair, and her face totally unreadable. "You'd probably like to see them again, wouldn't you?" she continues; her voice has dropped now, to a honey-sweet murmur. "I bet you've thought about that, haven't you? Thought about seeing them, maybe touching them. Am I right?"
见我没有回应，她停顿了一下，双手仍停留在胸前，随后抬头望向我。她的眼眸半掩在凌乱的红发之下，神情难以捉摸。“你大概很想再看一次，不是吗？”她继续说道，声音已变得如蜜糖般甜腻低沉。“我敢打赌，你肯定想过，想过再次看到它们，甚至触摸它们。我说得对吗？”

Fuck. Who wouldn't? I open my mouth to answer nervously in the negative anyway, but something stops me, some unexpected flash of glorious insight.
该死。谁不会呢？我张口本想紧张地否认，但某种突如其来的美妙洞察阻止了我。

She needs my attention. Not wants; needs. This is just like how she bugged me all day with the walkie-talkies, just like the fires when we were separated, just like the graffiti. Just like how she always used to bug me over the comm channels in our Evas. Hell, it's just like the first time she did this, when she was trying to explain thermal expansion at the NERV natatorium. If she's concerned that I'm not thinking of her, she has to do something to get my attention, to make sure she stays present in my thoughts somehow.
她需要我的关注。不是想要，而是需要。这就像她整天用对讲机烦我一样，就像我们分开时发生的火灾，就像那些涂鸦。就像她过去总是在我们的 Eva 通讯频道上烦我一样。该死，这就像她第一次这么做的时候，当时她试图在 NERV 的游泳池解释热胀冷缩。如果她担心我没有想到她，她就必须做些什么来吸引我的注意，确保她以某种方式留在我的思绪中。

She needs that. She needs me.
她需要那个。她需要我。

And what that means is that I have power over her. It's a new sensation for me, a little dizzying, but there it is. I don't even have the first idea what to do with it, how to use it or even whether to, but I suppose it means I don't have to put up with her teasing anymore. Or at least I can do it too. Give her something to think about.
这意味着我对她有影响力。对我来说这是一种新奇的感觉，有点让人眩晕，但事实就是如此。我甚至不知道该如何利用它，如何使用它，甚至是否应该使用它，但我想这意味着我不用再忍受她的戏弄了。或者至少我也可以这么做。给她点东西想想。

Only now remembering that my mouth is still open, I close it again, then lick my lips before speaking. "That's right." I stare her in the eye as I say it, hoping my voice doesn't sound too nervous, too faint. My heart is pounding like a drum roll, so loud in my ears I'd almost guess she can hear it.
直到现在才想起我的嘴还张着，我再次闭上它，然后舔了舔嘴唇才开口。“没错。”我直视她的眼睛说，希望我的声音听起来不会太紧张，太微弱。我的心跳得像鼓点一样，在我耳边如此响亮，我几乎猜想她也能听见。

Asuka blinks a few times at this, drawing slightly back from me, more in confusion than disgust. Then she frowns down at her chest again, actually stares at her own breasts for whatever reason. "You... might be surprised," she whispers. Squeezing herself once more, she lets her hands drop and sighs glumly, totally ignoring me.
明日香对此眨了几下眼，略微从我身边退开，更多是困惑而非厌恶。随后她又皱眉低头看向自己的胸口，不知何故，竟真的盯着自己的胸部看。“你...可能会感到惊讶，”她低声说道。再次紧握自己后，她松开手，沮丧地叹了口气，完全无视我的存在。

What? Surprised because I won't see them again, or because I will? Or was she even talking to me at all? She seems troubled now.
什么？惊讶是因为我再也看不到它们了，还是因为我将会看到？或者她刚才根本就不是在跟我说话？她现在似乎很烦恼。

Shaking my head, I wipe a few errant beads of sweat from my forehead. I... think I dodged a bullet there; maybe teasing her back isn't such a good idea. She'd probably win that war. I have something else to mention in any case, something I need to clear up if only for my own peace of mind. "What about Kaji?" I keep my voice as soft as I can, hoping she realizes I don't mean to be snide.
我摇了摇头，擦去额头上的几滴汗珠。我想...我刚才算是躲过一劫；或许回逗她并不是个好主意。她很可能会在这场较量中胜出。无论如何，我还有别的事情要提，有些事情我需要澄清，哪怕只是为了自己心安。“那加持先生呢？”我尽量压低声音，希望她能意识到我并无嘲讽之意。

I'm not sure what I expect, but it doesn't happen; all she does is draw knees to her chest and stare mutely out over the ridge. Reflected firelight dances in the edges of her eyes.
我不确定自己期待什么，但什么也没发生；她只是将膝盖蜷缩至胸前，默默地凝视着山脊之外。火光在她的眼角跳跃，映照出点点光芒。

When the silence suggests she's not going to answer, I shrug uncomfortably and shift again on the ground. I suppose if we're going to keep this sort of thing up, some folding chairs wouldn't kill us. And maybe an actual table of some sort while we're at it. As I ponder this, moonlight paints ghostly shadows on the empty city below the ridge.
当沉默暗示她不会回答时，我尴尬地耸了耸肩，再次在地面上挪动了一下。我想，如果我们还要继续这种状态，几把折叠椅应该不会要了我们的命。或许，再添置一张真正的桌子也不错。我正这么想着，月光在山脊下空荡的城市上绘出了幽灵般的影子。

"I... don't know that Kaji is coming back," she whispers eventually. "And... I'm... I don't think he ever really..."
“我……不知道卡吉会不会回来，”她最终低声说道，“而且……我……我不认为他真的……”

Ever really loved her? I doubt it, not after what he told me about Misato. Not as more than a gifted student. I wonder if she thought he did, before this.
真的爱过她吗？我对此表示怀疑，尤其是在他告诉我关于美里的事情之后。他对她，绝不仅仅是作为一个有才华的学生。我不知道在这之前，她是否曾以为他真的爱过她。

She doesn't add any more to the subject, and I leave her alone. Slowly the fire burns its way down, and I don't bother adding any more wood to it; lately our activity cycle has been determined largely by the sun, so since it's dark, it means it's almost bedtime. Although I wouldn't actually mind staying up longer with Asuka, even if we're just sitting like this next to the fire without saying anything. I'm glad neither of us feels the need to fill the silence with meaningless conversation.
她没有再继续这个话题，我也让她独自静一静。火堆慢慢燃尽，我没有再添柴；最近我们的作息很大程度上取决于太阳，既然天黑了，那就意味着差不多该睡觉了。虽然我并不介意和明日香一起多待一会儿，哪怕只是像这样坐在火堆旁，一言不发。我很高兴我们俩都不觉得有必要用无意义的对话来填补沉默。

Nevertheless, after maybe an hour, I climb to my feet and wander over to my blankets. She watches without twitching a muscle as I slip out of shoes, socks and shirt before slipping under the covers. Sometimes I wonder what's going through her head when she watches me like that; is she considering joining me, or merely watching me strip? Or are her eyes just following me because I happen to be moving? I guess this is the first night I've taken my shirt off too, but what's the point in letting it get too dirty too soon?
尽管如此，大约一个小时后，我还是站起身，漫步到我的毯子旁。她纹丝不动地看着我脱掉鞋子、袜子和衬衫，然后钻进被窝。有时我好奇，她那样看着我时脑子里在想什么；是在考虑加入我，还是仅仅看着我脱衣服？或者她的目光只是因为我恰好移动而跟随我？我想这是第一个我脱掉衬衫的夜晚，但何必让它太快变脏呢？

In moments, however, she herself retires for the night, crawling into her sleeping bag a few meters from mine, with the smoldering fire glowing away between us. I don't really get how she could sleep with me when we weren't spending the days together, but now that we are, she can't.
然而，片刻之后，她自己也去休息了，爬进离我几米远的睡袋里，我们之间是那堆燃烧着的火光。我不太明白，当我们白天不在一起时她怎么能和我一起睡，但现在我们在一起了，她却不能。

Whatever. I'm not going to worry about it. Rolling over, I hug the blankets to my chest and stare at the glowing coals until sleep claims me.
算了，我不打算为此烦恼。翻身抱紧毯子贴在胸前，我凝视着那闪烁的炭火，直到睡意袭来。

### Chapter 12 Andantino Rallentando
小行板逐渐放慢

I think I stare at him every morning now. Without motion on my part, just staring, head propped up on one hand as I gaze over across the cold remains of last night's fire and at his peaceful face. The sun's almost up now, and he's still asleep. I can be lazy, but I bet he actually sleeps more than I do.
如今，我似乎每天清晨都会不由自主地凝视着他。我静止不动，一手托腮，目光穿过昨夜篝火的残迹，停留在他那安详的面庞上。太阳即将升起，而他仍在梦乡。我虽懒散，但想必他睡得比我还要沉。

I think I overreacted yesterday, trying to figure him out. After another night to sleep on it, I don't think I'm going to do that again today.
昨天我可能反应过激了，试图揣摩他的心思。经过一夜的沉淀，我想今天我不会再重蹈覆辙。

It's still weird, though, thinking of him as an equal. Maybe not an intellectual equal -- let's be honest -- but a personal equal, someone who's on my own level and should be taken seriously. If anything, my rash overtures from yesterday just served to confirm this; when I push, he now either doesn't give a damn, or he pushes back. Convincingly. I can make him uncomfortable, but only by going out on a limb in the process, by putting myself at risk somehow.
尽管如此，想到他与我平起平坐还是觉得有些别扭。或许不是智力上的对等——坦白讲——但在个人层面上，他与我旗鼓相当，理应受到重视。昨天我那冒失的举动恰恰印证了这一点；当我施压时，他要么无动于衷，要么有力地回击。我确实能让他感到不安，但这样做我同样要承担风险，让自己处于险境。

Strangely, those risks haven't come back to bite me. So far he's been considerate.
出乎意料，那些风险并未对我造成困扰。至今为止，他表现得相当周到。

As I watch, he stirs in his sleep, rolling from his back to his side, facing me. An expression of vague thought crosses his features for a moment before the usual blandness returns.
我注视着他，他在睡梦中轻轻翻身，从仰卧转为侧躺，面朝向我。他的脸上短暂地闪过一丝若有所思的神情，随即又恢复了往常的平静。

I wonder what he dreams about. I don't usually remember my own.
我好奇他梦到了什么。我自己做的梦往往记不住。

Really, he's not bad company now. I kind of wish he'd say a little more, but I'd rather that he be quiet than chatter endlessly; it's more dignified this way. With the masturbation incident more or less out of the way, I don't even have much to hold against him anymore. I guess there's just the thing during Instrumentality, the help he wanted from me and to give me. And, of course, trying to kill me. Maybe I'll pop that one on him tonight.
实际上，他现在相处起来并不差。我倒希望他能多说点什么，但与其让他没完没了地闲聊，不如保持沉默，这样更显得庄重。自慰那件事已经差不多翻篇了，我对他也没什么可挑剔的了。大概就剩人类补完计划中他向我求助以及给予我的帮助那档子事了。还有，别忘了他曾试图杀我。或许今晚我会跟他挑明这件事。

The first rays of amber sunshine start angling in from the east. It's going to be warm again today.
晨曦初照，琥珀色的阳光斜斜地洒向大地，预示着今天又将是一个暖洋洋的日子。

Rolling my eyes, I unzip the sleeping bag and climb out of it. My shoes quickly find their way onto my feet, and then I step to the rest of my clothes to rummage through what I have. In truth I wish I could go around wearing less, but it's not really plausible. Shorts would be nice, but I don't even have any -- only jeans -- and I can't wear anything that leaves my stomach exposed, either.
我翻了个白眼，拉开睡袋的拉链，从里面钻出来。迅速穿上鞋子，然后走向我的衣物堆，开始翻找。说实话，我真希望能穿得少一些，但这并不现实。短裤固然好，可惜我一条也没有——只有牛仔裤——而且我也不能穿任何会露出腹部的衣服。

As I search, my hands find a blue swimsuit I picked up earlier and then never used. Shinji's probably not even aware I have it, since it's been tucked away with my underwear. A two-piece, with a bikini top... yeah, not really something I can wear. I don't even know why I grabbed it. Auto-pilot, probably. It looks nice, though.
在翻找中，我无意间触到了之前捡来却一直未穿的蓝色泳衣。真嗣恐怕都不晓得我有这件，它一直和我的内衣藏在一起。这是一件两件式的比基尼上衣...显然，这并不适合我。我甚至不明白当初为何会拿它。或许是下意识的行为。不过，它看起来确实挺漂亮的。

Blankets shift quietly behind me and I turn around to see Shinji stretching. Shortly his eyes blink open and he smiles at me. "Morning."
我身后的毯子轻轻挪动，我回过头，只见真嗣伸着懒腰。不久，他眨了眨眼，睁开眼睛，向我露出微笑：“早安。”

I nod briskly. "About time you woke up, slacker."
我快速地点头道：“你这懒虫，总算醒了。”

He shrugs, running a hand through his hair. "What's the rush? It's not like we're on a schedule... or... any, um..." He trails off, frowning at my hands.
他耸耸肩，伸手捋了捋头发。“这么急干嘛？我们又没定时间...或者...有什么，嗯...”他欲言又止，眉头微皱地看向我的手。

I blink, realizing I'm still holding the swimsuit, then snatch it out of his sight. "Don't get any ideas, smartass. I was about to go dress." Turning my back on him once more, I find the rest of the clothes I need, moving quickly, almost jerkily. Don't get any ideas? That didn't even make any sense, not in that context. Sometimes I need to let my mind catch up with my mouth.
我眨了眨眼，意识到手里还攥着泳装，赶紧藏到他看不见的地方。“别想多了，机灵鬼。我正要去换衣服呢。”再次背过身，我迅速找出其他要换的衣物，动作匆忙，略显僵硬。别想歪了？这话放在当时根本不合逻辑。有时候我得让脑子跟上嘴巴的速度。

A moment later I stride off into the trees with water and washcloth in addition to clothes. Why the hell am I mad? It's not like he snuck up me.
稍后，我携带着水和毛巾，以及衣物，迈步走进树林。我究竟为何生气？他并没有偷偷摸摸地靠近我。

Once to the spot I've been using to wash up, I peel down to my skin and do so. It's still not elegant, and frankly it's a little weird knowing Shinji uses the same washcloth, but at least with soap it's not too bad. Still, we should get another one. Or another half-dozen.
一到我常洗漱的地方，我便脱得一丝不挂开始清洗。虽然这并不雅致，而且想到真嗣也用同一块毛巾，心里总有些别扭，但好在用了肥皂后感觉还行。看来，我们得添置新的毛巾了，至少再备五六条。

After cleaning I hold the swimsuit up in my hands, then sigh. It is pretty, not that anyone but me will see it, and it'll serve well enough as underwear. Plus, if we split up again today, I can take my shirt off and ride around in just the top, maybe get some actual sun. On my scars.
清洗后，我双手捧起泳衣，轻叹一声。它虽美，却只有我欣赏，不过当内衣穿也挺合适。若今天我们再分头行动，我便可脱去上衣，仅着泳衣骑行，或许能真正晒晒太阳，让阳光抚慰我的疤痕。

With another sigh I put the damn thing on, then pull the rest of my clothes on over it. When I get back to the campsite, Shinji is still in his blankets.
我再次叹息，不情愿地套上那件东西，随后穿上其余衣物。回到营地时，真嗣依旧蜷缩在毯子中。

"Your turn," I tell him, tossing the damp washcloth onto the clothesline we almost never use. "Go crazy."
该你了，" 我对他说着，将湿抹布抛向那条我们鲜少使用的晾衣绳。"放开了玩吧。

"Yeah." Throwing his blankets aside, he rolls to his feet, grabs a few things and trots off into the forest.
"嗯。" 他一把掀开毯子，迅速起身，抓了几样东西就快步跑进了森林。

When he gets back a short while later, I'm munching on half-stale crackers. "What do you want to do today?" It's easier to ask him stuff now.
他一会儿回来时，我正嚼着半干的饼干。“今天你想做点什么？”现在问他事情轻松多了。

He shrugs, dropping to sit beside me. "I don't care. How many of those are left?"
他耸了耸肩，坐到我身边，问道：“这东西还剩多少？”

I eye him briefly, then peer into the box. "About half."
我瞥了他一眼，随即探头看向箱内，说：“差不多有一半。”

"Okay." Shaking his head, he runs a hand through his hair, then tugs on the baseball cap he's been wearing. "Did you still want to bring a whole bunch of food and water up here? If so, while we're in the city we could stop and get... cards, or some manga or something too, and then tomorrow we could just sit around and chill."
好的。" 他摇摇头，伸手捋了捋头发，接着调整了一下头上的棒球帽。"你还是打算带很多食物和水上来吗？那我们在城里时可以顺便买点卡片或漫画，明天就能悠闲地在这里打发时间了。

"Sure." That actually sounds surprisingly appealing. The sitting-around part, I mean.
"当然。" 那坐着不动的部分，听起来竟然出乎意料地吸引人。

Shinji doesn't add anything further, instead joining me in eating crackers. His wrist brushes mine on its way into the box, but he doesn't seem to notice. I play it cool as well.
真嗣并未继续发言，而是与我一同享用饼干。取饼干时，他的手腕不经意间触碰到了我的，然而他似乎并未察觉。我也同样保持镇定。

After we're done, I put the box away, then stand and brush dirt from my jeans. "Let's go steal a truck."
事情办完后，我收起盒子，起身拍去牛仔裤上的尘土。"走，我们去偷辆卡车。"

He blinks up at me for a moment, then chuckles and nods. "Fine. Think any still work?"
他抬头望了我一眼，随即轻笑点头。“行吧。你看还有能用的吗？”

"Beats me," I shrug, waiting for him to stand. "The one I took earlier worked okay. Not great, but okay."
我耸耸肩，等他起身，说：'之前那个我用着还凑合，虽不完美，但也算可以。'

"Oh, yeah." As we set off towards the road, he throws me a weird sideways glance. "What happened to that, anyway? When I saw you'd taken it, I figured the next time I saw you, you'd have it with you."
哦，对了。" 我们朝路走去时，他突然用一种奇怪的眼神瞥了我一眼。"那玩意儿后来怎么样了？我见你拿走了，还以为下次见面时你会带着它呢。

I laugh, reaching back to toy with my hair. "It, uh... I think it caught on fire."
我边笑边伸手拨弄头发，说：“呃，好像是着火了。”

After a moment he nods, unsurprised. I get the feeling he knows exactly what happened to it. Either that or he just knows me well enough to figure it went out in some spectacular fashion.
片刻后，他点头表示，显然并不意外。我感觉到他清楚地知道那东西的下落。如果不是这样，那就是他太了解我了，能猜到它必定是以某种轰轰烈烈的方式报销的。

Once we're out to the road we both pause, frowning up and down the line of JSSDF vehicles along the far edge. "The keys were in the ignition of the one I took," I recall quietly, squinting against the morning sun as I gaze downhill. "And... Shinji... you should drive."
我们一踏上道路，便不约而同地停下，眉头紧锁地打量着远处日本自卫队车辆排成的长龙。“我开走的那辆车，钥匙就插在点火器上，”我低声回忆，眯起眼睛迎着朝阳望向山坡下。“还有……真嗣……你来开车吧。”

He just nods again, wise enough to keep his mouth shut. Without waiting for me he wanders over to the nearest of the trucks and tugs the door open. I follow slowly, watching as he twists the key in the ignition and waits. After a moment of frowning, he relaxes, then tries it again.
他再次点头，明智地保持沉默。不等我，他就径直走向最近的那辆卡车，用力拉开驾驶室的门。我慢步跟随，只见他插入钥匙启动引擎，静静等待。眉头微皱后，他放松下来，再次尝试启动。

Eventually he sighs and faces me from the driver's seat. "No luck."
他最终叹了口气，从驾驶座上转过身来面对我。"运气不佳。"

"The dome light's not even on," I point out, nodding past him. "Battery's dead."
车顶灯都没亮，"我提醒道，朝他身后示意。"电池已经耗尽了。

Blowing cheeks out, he slips to the ground, then heads to the next one in line and repeats the drill. With the same result.
他鼓起双颊，不慎滑倒在地，随后又走向队列中的下一个人，重复同样的动作，结果依然如故。

After the fourth failure the two of us exchange concerned looks. After the sixth, open worry paints his face. The eighth one finally rumbles to life, though.
第四次失败后，我们彼此交换了忧虑的目光。到了第六次，他脸上已满是明显的担忧。好在第八次，机器终于轰鸣着运转起来。

Sighing with relief, I trot over to the other side and climb into the passenger's seat. Once the door is closed I can't see the meter or so of pavement between the truck and the edge of the road, so the window just shows me the steep tree-studded slope between here and the water far below.
我松了口气，小跑着来到另一侧，爬进副驾驶座位。车门一关，卡车与路边间那不足一米的空隙便消失在我的视野中，车窗映入眼帘的，是陡峭而树木丛生的山坡，以及山坡下遥远的湖面。

Shinji waits patiently for me to get into place, then shifts the vehicle nervously into reverse. What follows, I can describe only as a functional definition of trial and error; it's clear he's never parallel-parked, or un-parked, before, and I find myself watching with a smug grin as he clunks bumpers at least a dozen times before finally scraping clear of the parking spot.
真嗣耐心等我站好位置，然后紧张地挂上倒挡。接下来的操作，我只能称之为试错的过程；很明显他从未尝试过侧方停车，或是驶离车位，我带着一丝得意的微笑，看着他至少十几次撞到前后车辆，最后才勉强蹭出停车位。

Once we're moving he takes it slowly, obviously extremely nervous driving something so big and heavy. At least on the way down the hill he establishes that the brakes work well.
我们一启动，他就小心翼翼地驾驶，明显对操控这么庞大沉重的车辆感到非常紧张。好在下坡过程中，他验证了刹车系统运作良好。

After a while I get tired of this, and instead flip on the radio. Only static issues from the speakers, which I expected, but a quick cycle through the spectrum reveals absolutely nothing else, not even the faintest echo of a signal. I'd hoped that, if anyone else was around, they might have set up a little pirate station running on a generator or some such, just in the hopes of establishing contact with others. It was a silly thought, to be sure, but easy enough to check.
不久后，我对现状感到厌倦，便打开了收音机。扬声器中只有静电噪音，这在意料之中，但迅速扫描整个频段，却一无所获，连一丝信号的回响也捕捉不到。我曾幻想，若还有其他幸存者，他们可能会用发电机搭建一个小型非法电台，只为寻求与外界的联系。这念头虽显幼稚，但尝试一番也无伤大雅。

Flipping that off, I next try the military radio, but although the static carries a different quality, it's no less absolute. We're alone.
关闭那个设备后，我转而尝试使用军用电台，然而，尽管静电声有所不同，它依然是一片死寂。我们彻底孤立了。

With a sigh I thumb the radio's power off and lean back in the hard plastic seat. Outside the window, a seemingly endless line of military hardware drifts past.
我轻叹一声，关闭了收音机，身体向后靠在坚硬的塑料座椅上。透过车窗，一列列军用装备仿佛没有尽头般缓缓掠过。

"Where do you want to go?" asks Shinji. "Another grocery store?"
你想去哪儿？" 真嗣问道。"还是去另一家超市？

I twist my lips at this. "Maybe. A big one, though, one where we can find stuff still in pallets in the back."
我对此不以为然地撇了撇嘴。“或许吧。不过得是大型的，那种仓库后面还能找到未拆封整板货物的。”

"Oh, yeah," he murmurs. "Good idea. How do we get in that way, though? The delivery doors and stuff are probably closed."
哦，对，" 他轻声附和。"确实是个好主意。不过，我们怎么才能从那边进去呢？那些送货门估计都关上了。

I smile at the window. "So? I bet this'll open them. And if not it can probably open a wall."
我对着窗户微笑道：“怎么样？我猜这能打开窗户。如果不行，说不定还能打开一面墙呢。”

"We have to drive it back up the hill, Asuka," he notes tightly. "We can't hurt it too badly."
我们得把它开回山上去，明日香，"他语气紧张。"别让它伤得太重。

I shrug and opt not to answer. The morning sunlight glittering on the ruby water is almost blinding. Maybe I should get some sunglasses too.
我耸了耸肩，决定不作答。晨光在如红宝石般的水面上闪耀，几乎让人睁不开眼。看来我也得准备一副太阳镜了。

Shinji drives around for maybe half an hour before finding a place that suits our purposes, and it takes a good five minutes of badgering by me until he finally growls and plants the truck through the loading dock door. After that, entry is trivially easy, and the smell isn't even that bad; apparently there are enough closed doors and whatnot between here and the rotting stuff that it doesn't make me want to vomit. A little bit of searching finds us a pallet full of cases of bottled water, just like I predicted, and after a little wrestling we're able to make a battery-powered forklift whine and protest enough to lift it into the truck.
真嗣驾车兜转了约半小时，终于找到一个符合我们需求的地方。经过我一番劝说，他才不情愿地驾车撞开了装卸区的门。进入后，一切变得简单，气味也并未令人难以忍受；多亏了层层隔断，腐烂的恶臭并未扑鼻而来。我们很快找到了预想中的一托盘瓶装水，费了些劲，让电池叉车发出抗议般的声响，将水抬上了卡车。

After a few quick runs to pick up armfuls of more dried and canned goods, we leave the grocery store. From there Shinji takes us just across the street, to a strip mall; the only places of interest to us therein are a convenience store -- more food, without the smell of rot -- and a combination gift/toy store. While looking for food, Shinji is his usual boring self, fretting over how crappy most of the stuff is, but I seize the opportunity to stock up on a few different kinds of chips and candy. Just in case. The other place is also mostly full of crap, if of a different variety, but we walk out of there with a soccer ball, two decks of cards and a few board games that looked like they didn't totally suck. I also suggested, maybe a little too innocently, that we get a chessboard, but Shinji flatly refused to play against me.
经过几次迅速的采购，我们满载着干货和罐头食品离开了超市。Shinji 接着带我们过街，来到一个商业区；那里只有两家店引起了我们的兴趣——一家便利店——提供更多食物，没有腐烂的味道——以及一家礼品兼玩具店。在搜寻食物时，Shinji 依旧显得无聊，对大多数商品的质量挑剔不已，而我则趁机储备了几种不同的薯片和糖果，以备不时之需。另一家店里也充斥着各种无用之物，但我们还是挑选了一个足球、两副扑克牌和几个看起来还不错的桌游带走了。 我还曾天真地提议过，或许弄个棋盘来玩，然而真嗣却坚决拒绝与我下棋。

From there we head about a kilometer away, to the library we were at once before. Though I'm smiling as we walk in, it's an uncomfortable expression; it was just after we left here that everything started going to hell.
我们离开那里后，前往约一公里外的图书馆，之前我们曾到访过。虽然我走进时面带微笑，但这笑容显得有些勉强；正是离开此地后，事情开始急转直下。

I try not to dwell on it this time, though. I think we're both smarter now.
这次我尽量不去多想。我觉得我们俩现在都更明智了。

It doesn't take us long to get down to business. In short order we leave with no fewer than six full series of manga, not to mention a couple dozen classics I figured we should read. If left to his own devices I'm sure Shinji would have just stuck to the manga.
我们迅速投入正事。很快，我们便带着至少六套完整的漫画系列离开，此外还有我认定该读的几十部经典之作。若让真嗣自行其是，他肯定只会专注于漫画。

Once we're back in the truck, he sighs, then gives me a tired smile. "Back home, then?"
回到车里，他叹了口气，疲惫地对我笑了笑。“回家了？”

I shake my head. "I wanted to look for a generator," I remind him. "We may as well do it while we're here and we have this thing with us."
我摇摇头说：“我本想去寻个发电机。”我提醒他，“既然我们人在这里，又有这东西在手，不妨趁机找找。”

"Oh. Right." Twisting the ignition to life, he pauses, then clears his throat. "So, where would we, um... look for something like that?"
哦，对了。" 他启动车子，稍作停顿后清了清喉咙。"那么，我们该去哪儿找那样的东西呢？

I open my mouth... then close it again. Huh. "I'm not sure," I admit uncomfortably. "Umm... let's check a hardware store first, maybe, and if not there... just drive, and see what jumps out at us." If worst comes to worst, I could always just make one, I suppose.
我张开嘴，却又闭上了。"我不太确定，"我有些尴尬地承认，"嗯...我们先去五金店瞧瞧，要是没有合适的...就开车四处逛逛，看能碰到什么。"实在不行的话，我想我也能自己动手做一个。

Shinji shrugs and nods. "Sounds good."
真嗣耸了耸肩，点头道：“挺好的。”

A few hours later, however, I suspect he no longer thinks it sounds good, and I finally give him permission to head back up the hill. After the hardware store I had him check everywhere I could think of -- banks, schools, even an athletic field -- but there was nothing portable, nothing I could use.
几小时后，我猜他已不再觉得这提议吸引人，便最终同意他返回山上。离开五金店后，我让他四处寻找——银行、学校，甚至运动场——但都找不到任何便携可用之物。

On reaching our campsite again, he backs off the road and a short distance into the trees, as far as the truck will go. Then, after opening the back, the two of us stand there for a moment, wondering how to get the water out, as the pallet is all one piece. While I'm trying to figure out novel ways of leveraging it out, Shinji disappears, then returns shortly with the hunting knife, which he uses simply to cut the thing into its component cases. I give him a narrow look for that, but say nothing as I grab the first one and head back to the campsite.
回到营地后，他将车倒离道路，驶入树丛一小段距离，直至卡车无法再前进。我们打开后车厢，一时愣住，不知如何取出水，因为整个托盘是一体的。我正琢磨着如何巧妙地将其取出，Shinji 却突然离开，不久带着猎刀回来，他干脆利落地用刀将托盘分割成一个个独立的箱子。我对此瞥了一眼，但未置一词，只是拎起第一个箱子，径直返回营地。

When everything is finally moved and put away, we've got a small mountain of water tucked off to the side, among the trees. It's kind of strange, but I feel almost... proud. Maybe it's stupid, but we planned ahead, and now we have some very tangible and useful results to show for it.
当所有物品都已搬移并整理好后，我们在树丛旁意外地拥有了一座小山般的水源。这感觉虽有些奇异，却让我几乎感到自豪。或许这听起来可笑，但我们事先的规划如今带来了实实在在且极为有用的成果。

"So how long will this last us?" wonders Shinji tiredly as we're staring at our handiwork. He's thrown his hat aside; maybe it got too hot.
"这样能维持多久呢？" 真嗣疲惫地思索着，我们正凝视着自己的杰作。他可能因为太热，已经把帽子扔到了一边。

I hesitate, counting quickly. "Assuming conservatively -- that we go through a case a day, including cooking and cleaning water -- it should last us over a month." Damn. We'll have to think of something else to do now, when not scrounging.
我犹豫着，快速计算了一番。“保守估计，如果每天用一箱，包括做饭和清洁用水，应该能撑一个多月。”真糟糕。看来除了搜寻物资，我们还得找点其他事情做。

He shakes his head mutely, eyeing me sideways. "We're rich."
他默不作声地摇摇头，斜睨着我。“我们很有钱。”

I laugh, but stop quickly. He's right. Money isn't gold or industry anymore. Money is water now. Of course, with it sitting all over the place in the city, and only two people, the distinction is perhaps both premature and meaningless.
我笑了一下，随即止住。他说的没错。如今，金钱已非黄金或工业，而是如同水一般。在城市中它无处不在，却只有我们两人，这种区分或许既为时过早又毫无意义。

"Anyway," he sighs, cracking his back with a grimace, "I can start cooking if you want. It's almost dark."
不管怎样，" 他叹息着，皱眉活动了一下背部，"如果你想，我可以开始做饭了。天色已晚。

"What? You're kidding me." Frowning, I glance up at the sky, but he's right; the sun is almost to the mountain peaks to our west. "I can't believe we spent all day doing that crap."
什么？你在逗我吗？"我皱眉望向天空，确实如他所说，太阳已快沉入西边的山峰。"真不敢相信我们竟浪费了一整天在那破事上。

"It was your idea," he recalls, then wanders off, towards the firewood.
他回忆说：'那是你的主意。'随后便漫步向柴火堆走去。

Mimicking him under my breath, I run a hand through my hair, then make my way to sit near the firepit. I kind of like watching him cook anyway.
我低声学着他的样子，顺手理了理头发，随后走到火坑边坐下。看他做饭，我倒是挺享受的。

After a meal of spicy Thai noodles -- it's almost all noodles in the evening now -- I clean up quickly, then settle in next to him while he's staring at the sky. I don't know what he sees up there. "Hey, Shinji?"
晚餐享用过辣味泰式面条后——如今晚上几乎都是面条——我迅速整理完毕，便在他凝望天空时坐到他身旁。我不清楚他在那片天空中寻觅着什么。“嘿，真嗣？”

"Yeah?" 真的吗？

I chew a lip, suddenly uncertain. I want to ask about something important to me, but after today, I feel kind of... good. And I don't really want to argue, for once. And anyway, he helped, and might perhaps deserve a night off from this stuff.
我轻咬着嘴唇，忽然感到一丝犹豫。心中有件重要的事想问，但今天过后，我竟感到几分舒畅。这一次，我并不想争执。何况，他刚刚帮了忙，或许也该让他从这些纷扰中暂时解脱一晚。

"Asuka?" 阿苏卡吗？

I sigh, giving my head a toss, and fix him with a lidded stare. He gazes back at me, eyes widening slightly, probably wondering what the hell is coming next, and the smile that touches my lips in response to his discomfiture is genuine. "You're handy," I remark, letting my eyes roam down his reclining person, mostly to mess with him.
我轻叹一声，甩了甩头，半眯着眼凝视他。他回望过来，眼神微张，或许在揣测接下来会有何事，而我因他的窘态而浮现的笑意却是发自内心的。“你挺机灵的，”我边说边将视线在他躺着的身躯上徘徊，多半是为了逗他。

Sadly, he merely nods, though his cool facade is somewhat spoiled by a visible swallow. "Yeah? You're pulling your weight too."
遗憾的是，他仅微微颔首，然而那明显的吞咽动作让他的冷静表象略显失色。“哦？你也在出力呢。”

Hesitating, I study him sharply, wondering what he meant; was that a flirty remark I just didn't get, a comment about my weight, or a straightforward compliment? He's staring straight back at me as I think, not checking me out at all, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
我迟疑着，目光锐利地打量他，揣摩他话里的深意：是调情的弦外之音我没听懂，还是对我的体重有所指摘，又或者仅仅是直接的夸赞？他直勾勾地回望着我，并未上下打量，但这也不足以说明什么。

Eventually I chuckle, shaking my head as I shift my attention to the city below. It's actually fun to tease him now, since I never really know what he's going to do. It's almost a shame he's... just... yeah.
最后我忍不住笑了，边摇头边将视线投向脚下的城市。如今逗弄他确实挺有意思，因为我总是猜不透他的下一步。他几乎让人感到遗憾，只是……嗯，就这样。

I decide to leave him alone for the rest of the night. I don't want him getting the wrong idea.
我决定今晚剩下的时间让他独自待着，以免他误会。

The next day starts late and moves slowly, for once, and I find I kind of enjoy it. After a breakfast of more crackers, followed by some cinnamon red-hots I found yesterday, we pull out the collected literature we scored at the library. I can tell Shinji wants to dive right into the manga, but he makes a show of going through the actual books first.
第二天起得晚，节奏也放缓，这种悠闲让我感到颇为惬意。早餐吃了些饼干，随后享用了昨天发现的肉桂糖，我们便翻阅起从图书馆带回的资料。真嗣显然迫不及待想看漫画，却还是装模作样地先翻阅了其他书籍。

Then he pauses, holding two of them, one in each hand. "What the hell?" he mutters. "You got both The Wealth of Nations and The Communist Manifesto?"
他顿了顿，双手各持一书。"这是怎么回事？"他低声自语。"你竟然同时拥有《国富论》和《共产党宣言》？"

"Why not?" I shrug. "Read both sides. Get educated. I actually read them both in college, so they're for you."
何乐而不为呢？" 我耸耸肩。"两边观点都看看，增长见识。我大学时都读过，这些是为你准备的。

He shoots me a dark look, then sighs, placing them back in the pile. "Thanks. Though I'm not making any promises as to when I'm... wait, Mein Kampf? You've read that too?"
他阴沉地瞥了我一眼，叹息着将书放回原处。“谢谢。但我无法承诺何时会……等等，《我的奋斗》？你连那本书也读过？”

I grin. "Actually, no. But I saw it on the shelf and it's not like anyone else is about to read it."
我笑了笑。“其实，我没打算读。只是看到它在书架上，反正也没人急着要看。”

Shinji sighs again. "Oh. I figured since you're German, you would... uh..."
真嗣又叹了口气。"哦，我以为你是德国人，应该会...那个..."

He trails off, watching my face, but I'm just lifting my eyebrows, trying to decide whether to punish his ignorance or his insensitivity. Eventually settling on the former, I punch his knee, hard. "No, I wouldn't. And I'm technically American, dumbass." Seriously. He's lucky I'm so easy-going and hard to offend.
他声音渐弱，目光紧盯我的脸，而我只是挑了挑眉，心里琢磨着该惩罚他的无知还是不敏感。最终决定惩罚前者，我用力捶了他的膝盖一下。“不，我不会那样做。严格来说，我也是美国人，你个笨蛋。”说真的，他运气好，我这人随和，不容易生气。

"Sorry," he murmurs, grimacing as he sets the book aside. "I didn't mean... Sorry. Did you get anything not related to politics somehow?"
抱歉，" 他轻声说，皱眉将书搁置一旁。"我并非有意...不好意思。你有没有找到些与政治无关的东西？

I give him a withering, impatient look. "Have you even looked at the pile, moron? I'm not going to tell you everything I picked out when it's all right there." Curriculum in Berlin was geared largely towards Western classics, of course, so given the chance I picked up The Tale of Genji and The Book of Five Rings yesterday, though I'm not certain I'll be able to read them very well. I threw in a couple of Russian literary titles as well for good measure, though I made the conscious decision to leave War and Peace on the shelf, because... honestly.
我向他投去一个冷淡且不耐烦的眼神。“你有没有看过那堆书，笨蛋？我不会一一告诉你我挑了什么，它们不都摆在那儿吗？”柏林的课程主要侧重于西方经典，因此昨天有机会时，我选了《源氏物语》和《五轮书》，虽然不确定自己能否读懂。为了保险起见，我还挑了几本俄罗斯文学作品，但特意没拿《战争与和平》，毕竟……那书太厚了。

Shinji just grunts as he flips through the pile, paying token attention to the classic titles. When done he simply moves onto the manga, quickly selecting the first of an action-oriented series, something about a guy with superpowers who steals cars.
真嗣只是低声嘟囔，随手翻阅着那堆书，对经典作品只是稍作留意。翻完后，他便转向漫画区，迅速挑了部动作系列的第一卷，讲述的是一个拥有超能力的男子偷车的故事。

In truth I grab manga as well. Just a few months ago I probably would have preferred something centered around fighting, but... stuff changes. Now I just want something stupid and funny. The story of a bumbling ninja, I figure, will serve well enough.
其实，我也喜欢看漫画。几个月前，我可能更倾向于选择以战斗为主题的，但现在情况不同了。如今，我只想找些轻松搞笑的内容。一个笨手笨脚的忍者的故事，我觉得挺合适的。

As the morning wears on, Shinji and I both read in silence. It's good to laugh at something, good to hear him laugh every now and then too.
随着清晨时光的推移，我和真嗣都默默地沉浸在阅读中。能开怀一笑真好，偶尔听到他的笑声也让人感到愉悦。

Later, when it's almost midday, he puts his book down and stretches. "Hey, you know what?"
不久，临近正午时分，他合上书，伸了伸懒腰。"哎，你知道个事儿吗？"

Frowning, I mentally mark my place in my current volume, then raise an eyebrow at him. He interrupted me. "What?"
皱眉间，我在心中记下阅读的进度，随即对他挑眉示意。他打断了我，“什么事？”

"We should go see the crater one of these days," he decides, twisting to stare at the massive hole in the city's center. "The one from the GeoFront... or Black Moon, or whatever they called it."
我们得找个时间去看看那个火山口，"他下定决心，转头望向城市中心那巨大的坑洞。"就是来自 GeoFront 的那个，或者他们叫它黑月之类的。

They? They who? I dismiss the question with a tiny shake of my head, then fix him with a frown. "Why?"
他们？指的是谁？我微微摇头，将这个问题抛诸脑后，随后皱起眉头直视他。“为什么？”

He shrugs, still gazing thoughtfully out over the ridge. "It's... important."
他耸耸肩，依旧若有所思地望着山脊。“这事……很关键。”

"It's a hole in the ground."
这是一个地洞。

"It's..." Blinking, he shifts to face me at an angle, blue eyes meeting my own without humor. "Don't you want closure?"
这是……" 他眨着眼，侧身面对我，蓝色的眼睛直视着我，毫无笑意。"你难道不渴望有个了结吗？

"Closure?" I snort. "The whole city's closure, Shinji. It's empty. The whole world is. You can't even look at the ocean, or at the sky, without remembering that."
封闭？" 我嗤之以鼻。"整个城市都荒废了，真嗣。空荡荡的。整个世界都这样。你连看海或看天都做不到，一望便勾起回忆。

He rolls his shoulders irritably, returning to stare at the city. "It was just a thought," he murmurs. "Sorry."
他烦躁地耸耸肩，再次凝视着城市。“只是突然想到的，”他轻声道歉，“不好意思。”

I shake my head, trying not to sigh, and grab my manga again. Thanks to jerk-face, I'm not really in a mood to be entertained anymore, but I keep at it anyway, hoping that the farcical adventures in the printed pages will carry my attention to more trivial matters.
我摇了摇头，努力不让自己叹气，再次拿起漫画。由于那个讨厌的家伙，我此刻实在提不起兴致娱乐，但仍然坚持阅读，期待书中荒诞不经的冒险能让我转移注意力，关注到更为琐碎的事务上。

They don't. After a good ten minutes without turning I page, I finally sigh and let the book fold itself back shut. "Shinji."
他们并未翻页。经过漫长的十分钟，我轻叹一声，任由书本缓缓合拢。“真嗣。”

He jerks his head up to watch me, almost solicitously. "Hmm?"
他突然抬头望向我，眼神中带着几分关切。“嗯？”

I feel a frown stealing over my forehead, and I don't meet his gaze. It's kind of a strange feeling, but I actually feel like I can ask him about stuff now and get honest answers, not drama. The answers may not be to my liking, but I don't have to worry that he's providing them out of self-pity or a desire to please or any such crap. "Why did you try to kill me?"
我感到眉头不自觉地皱起，目光并未与他交汇。这感觉颇为奇异，但我现在确实觉得可以向他提问，期待的是坦诚的回答，而非戏剧性的演绎。答案或许不会让我满意，但我无需担心他是出于自怜、讨好或其他无谓的动机来回答。"你为何要置我于死地？"

My words come out almost as a whisper. I grimace, closing my eyes.
我的话语几乎低如耳语。我皱着眉，闭上了双眼。

Shinji is silent for long moments before answering. "I was going to ask which time," he admits softly, "but the second time was sort of... a continuation of the first for me, so they're the same reasons. You really want to go into it?"
真嗣沉默良久后才开口：“我原本想问你指的是哪一次，”他低声说道，“但第二次对我而言，其实是第一次的延续，所以原因并无二致。你确定要探究这个吗？”

I nod. This needs to be cleared up.
我点头表示同意。这件事需要澄清一下。

He sighs. "Asuka, you... betrayed me."
他叹息道：“明日香，你……竟然背叛了我。”

Startled, I frown at him before realizing I've opened my eyes again. "What do you mean?"
我一惊，皱眉看向他，随即意识到自己再次睁开了双眼。“你这话是什么意思？”

His brows draw slightly together, though whether in thought or anger, I can't say. "I needed help," he whispers, now staring at his open hands. "You remember what it was like there, how hard it could be to hold yourself together; I needed to talk to someone who could help me find solid ground, so I wouldn't just disappear. I was asking you to save my life. And yeah, I know we didn't really get along -- I get that -- but I figured that, on some level, there would be some... some basic human compassion between us. I figured that you'd help save my life. And then you didn't."
他眉头微蹙，难以分辨是沉思还是愠怒。“我需要帮助，”他低语着，目光凝视着自己摊开的手掌。“你还记得那里的艰难，要维持自我有多不易；我渴望与能助我立足的人交谈，以免我彻底消逝。我是在恳求你挽救我的生命。我清楚我们并不和睦——我理解这一点——但我原以为，在某种程度上，我们之间至少会有一些……一些基本的人类同情。我以为你会伸出援手。可你没有。”

I chew a lip, pondering this. "I was right, though," I note quietly. "You didn't need my help. You didn't get it, and you're still here."
我咬着嘴唇，陷入沉思。“但我确实说中了，”我低声说道。“你并不需要我的帮助。即便没有得到帮助，你还是坚持下来了。”

"I almost wasn't," he counters, his voice and manner flat. "I was going to let the world stay like that. It actually took talking to Rei before I was sure I'd stay alive, before I changed my mind."
我差点就没这么做，"他反驳道，语气平淡，态度冷静。"我原本打算任由世界维持现状。实际上，是和 Rei 谈过之后，我才下定决心要活下去，才改变了初衷。

"Then I was right about that instead," I point out. "Anyone could have helped you. You'd use sympathy from anyone." I haven't thought about this too much since coming back, but now it's all bubbling to the surface again, the anger, the disgust.
"看来我当时说对了，"我指出。"你本可以寻求任何人的帮助。你总是利用别人的同情心。"回来后我并未深思此事，然而此刻，那些愤怒与厌恶感再次涌上心头。

"I didn't want it from anyone." His voice rises; he's getting angry too. "I wanted it from you."
我并非想从任何人那里得到它。" 他的声音变得尖锐，怒气也上来了。"我只希望从你这里得到。

I regard him coldly. "Why?"
我冷漠地注视着他，问道：“为什么？”

"Because you needed help too," he snaps. "Do you think I couldn't tell how you felt? A lot of that was my doing, so I thought I'd do the right thing and help you get over it. It wasn't being selfish, Asuka; people help each other out when they have to. Grown-up people do, anyway."
你当时不也需要帮助吗？"他语气尖锐。"你以为我看不透你的心情？很多事都是我惹的，所以我想做点对的，帮你走出来。这并非自私，明日香；人在必要时本就该互相扶持。至少成熟的人会这么做。

"Yeah?" I can feel my lips peeling angrily back. Grown-up people? "You were so fucking pathetic. You couldn't even lift your head to stare me in the eye. Does that shout confidence to you? Does that really sound like a person who's going to have any success understanding, let alone addressing, my own problems? You think you wanted to help me now, because that's what you'd do now, because you've grown since then, but there's no way you could have done it at the time. You just wanted a crutch to hold up your broken self."
"真的吗？"我感到自己的嘴唇因愤怒而紧绷。所谓的成年人？"你那时简直可悲至极。连头都抬不起来，直视我的勇气都没有。这算哪门子自信？这听起来像是一个能理解我问题，更别提解决问题的人吗？你以为你现在想帮我，因为那是你现在的想法，因为你已经有所成长，但当时你根本无能为力。你不过是想找个支撑，来撑起你那破碎的自我罢了。

A strange look, a cold one, passes over Shinji's face, and he climbs to his feet to stare down at me. "So full of your own problems," he whispers, and it occurs to me he's actually shaking, like he's just holding to his temper by one frayed thread. "So worried about yourself. You wanted to let me die because I wouldn't be able to help you enough. And yet here you are, the only one here besides me. Even without my help, you were still so strong that you're the only person in the world who's made it back."
真嗣脸上掠过一丝怪异而冷漠的神情，他站起身，低头凝视着我。“你满心都是自己的烦恼，”他轻声细语，我这才发觉他其实在颤抖，好像仅靠一根即将断裂的线在控制着怒气。“你曾因我帮不上忙而希望我死去。可即便没有我的助力，你依旧强大到成为除我之外唯一重返此地的人。”

I blink at this, confused. Is that really what he thinks about me? He doesn't get it, that I was fleeing, not returning triumphantly.
我对此眨眼不解，他真的这么看我吗？他没明白，我是逃离，并非凯旋归来。

"And so I just... I started to hate you," he continues, staring at nothing, shaking hands reaching out to squeeze... nothing. "And that was it. There was nothing there, no goodwill at all anymore, no concern. Nothing. Just poison. So I strangled you."
于是我便...开始憎恨你，"他接着说，眼神空洞，颤抖的手伸向空中，试图抓住...却什么也抓不到。"一切就此结束。那里已无半点善意，毫无关怀。空无一物。只剩下恶意。因此，我勒死了你。

He's not entirely right. It wasn't that I was indifferent to his fate -- I wanted to see him stronger -- but I didn't, and still don't, have any interest in playing the crutch for someone who's nothing but needs. I remember my own surprise when his hands appeared around my neck, remember how it suddenly made sense how much I'd hurt him. Like him, I could tell that any sense of friendship or camaraderie between us was just... shattered forever. Never to be put back together. So I just... didn't fight him. It seemed like the best thing to do. Let myself die. At least one of us would be happy then.
他并非全对。我并非对他的命运无动于衷——我期望他变得更强大——但我不想，现在也不想，成为那些只有需求的人的依靠。我记得当他双手掐住我脖子时，我内心的震惊，那一刻我突然意识到我给他带来了多大的伤害。和他一样，我能感觉到我们之间的任何友谊或情谊都已……永远破碎。再也无法复原。因此，我只是……没有反抗他。这似乎是最好的选择。让自己死去。至少那样我们中有一个会得到解脱。

Slowly I rise to my own feet, wondering how to explain it to him without making him even madder. Wondering if it's possible to explain at all.
我慢慢站起来，琢磨着怎样向他解释才能不让他更生气。也在想，到底能不能解释得通。

"And then on the beach..." He draws a shuddering breath, staring coldly at me. "You just... it all came back, and I didn't even realize what I was doing at first. But when I did, I didn't try to stop. And this was even after I learned what little I could from that whole thing, learned that life is pain and you can never escape it and that's okay."
接着在海滩上...他颤抖着深吸一口气，冷冷地看着我。'你只是...一切突然涌上心头，起初我甚至没察觉自己在做什么。但当我察觉到时，我并没有试图停下来。这甚至是在我领悟了那件事的点滴之后，明白了生活本就充满痛苦，你无法逃避，但这也无妨。'

So even to bleak life-is-pain Shinji, I was so upsetting he wanted to kill me. I guess I was right about all possible concern between us having been crushed. Which makes me wonder idly how it is that we're even standing here at all, talking about it.
即便对生活感到绝望的碇真嗣而言，我也令他如此心烦意乱，以至于他竟想置我于死地。看来我关于我们之间一切关切都已不复存在的判断是正确的。这不禁让我好奇，我们究竟是如何还能站在这里，讨论这件事的。

Blue eyes narrow to regard me with hot accusation. "You could just be... such a bitch, Asuka. You expected me to know everything about how to act around you, to know exactly what you wanted all the time, without you ever having to tell me. I'd never had a friend in my life before coming to Tokyo-3, and it was hard to talk to anyone, let alone you, but you would snap at me when I tried to ask you anything about yourself, and then you would get mad because I didn't understand you. I got so tired of your shit."
蓝眼睛眯成一条线，带着炽热的指责凝视着我。“你有时真是……太刻薄了，明日香。你期望我能无师自通地懂得如何与你相处，洞悉你所有的需求，而你却从不明言。在来到第三新东京市之前，我从未有过朋友，与人交流已是难事，更不用说与你了。每当我试图了解你，你却对我发火，接着又因为我无法领会你的心思而生气。我真是受够了这一切。”

Yeah, that's probably all true. I've never really thought about it from his point of view... and he probably hasn't thought about it from mine. I hadn't had any friends either, then; I had no peers back in Germany. That was most of what made the move to Japan tolerable; I was going to be surrounded by people my own age who'd realize how awesome I was and look up to me.
确实，那些话大概都是真的。我以前从未真正站在他的立场上思考过...他可能也未曾从我的角度考虑过。当时我也没有朋友，在德国时身边没有同龄人。搬到日本之所以能忍受，主要是因为我将和一群同龄人在一起，他们会发现我的优秀并对我刮目相看。

He's staring at me, I realize. Waiting for me to argue back, to make some excuse or defense so he can tear into me again.
我察觉到他正盯着我，似乎在等待我反驳或找借口，以便再次对我发起攻击。

Well, I don't have any more defenses. There's nothing I can say.
唉，我已无言以对，再无辩解之词。

Instead I reach forward and touch him again. The palm of my hand slides across his cheek; fingers whisper into the hair on the back of his head while my thumb traces an idle line down his ear. It feels better this time, touching him without bandages between his skin and mine. Even seeing the linear scar on my hand doesn't really bother me.
我反而伸手再次触碰他。手掌轻抚他的脸颊，指尖轻触他后脑的头发，拇指则随意地描画着他的耳廓。这次没有绷带阻隔，肌肤相触的感觉更胜以往。即便看到手上的疤痕，也并未让我感到不适。

His eyes grow wide; his breath catches. I can feel my own pulse in the palm of my hand, against his skull. It's slow, a tranquil rhythm.
他瞪大了眼睛，屏住了呼吸。我感受到自己手掌下脉搏的跳动，紧贴着他的头骨，节奏缓慢而平和。

Eventually he tears his gaze away from mine, pulls away from me, and sighs heavily. "Asuka, I'm..." Swallowing, he drops to sit on the ground, then runs a hand through his hair. "I'm sorry. I got... a little carried away, I guess." His voice is hoarse.
最终，他移开目光，从我身边退开，深深叹了口气。“明日香，我……”他咽了口唾沫，坐到地上，用手梳理了一下头发。“对不起，我刚才……有点失控了。”他的声音显得有些嘶哑。

Lips thinned, I fold myself up and sit carefully beside him, not really certain what to say. I can feel pieces shifting around in my head, though; something just happened, and I've almost got it figured out.
我紧抿着嘴唇，小心翼翼地蜷缩身体，坐在他身旁，却语塞不知如何开口。脑海中的思绪似乎在重新组合，刚刚一定发生了什么，我正逐渐理清头绪。

As I settle into place, he glances over at me, his face now open and worried. He's back to his usual sincerity. "It... must have been hard for you, too," he murmurs, not quite catching my eye. "I shouldn't have... shouldn't have said that stuff. Shouldn't have done it."
我刚坐定，他就忧心忡忡地看了我一眼，恢复了往日的真诚。“这对你来说肯定也不容易，”他轻声说道，目光并未与我交汇。“我不该说那些话，不该那么做。”

And now he's regretful? Things click into place; I get it.
他现在感到后悔了？事情逐渐清晰；我懂了。

Tenderness breaks him. It gets through his armor, makes him nice.
温柔瓦解了他的防线。它渗透进他的盔甲，使他变得温和可亲。

And there's a corollary: I can actually be tender to him, and he won't come back and hurt me. He won't push me away, or punish my gesture with laughter or biting comments.
还有一个相应的结论：我其实可以对他温柔以待，而他不会因此回头伤害我。他不会将我推开，也不会用嘲笑或尖刻的话语来回应我的善意。

I may have to verify this, but first there are some things I need to know. "Do you still hate me?"
我或许得确认一下，不过在此之前，我有几个问题想问。"你现在还讨厌我吗？"

"No. Asuka... no, of course not." He shakes his head slowly. "Not to put things too lightly, but you... sort of... caught me on a bad day, there. Things got a little out-of-hand, and I overreacted."
不，明日香……不，当然不是。" 他轻轻摇头，"不是想轻描淡写，但你恰好撞上了我不顺的一天。当时情况有点失控，我反应过激了。

I nod slightly, staring straight ahead, not really seeing anything. "Do you still need me?"
我轻轻点头，目光直视前方，却视而不见。“还需要我吗？”

This time it takes him a moment to respond. "If you left again," he answers quietly, "I wouldn't die. So not like I did before. But if you left... it would hurt. So... I think so."
这次他沉默了片刻才开口：“如果你再次离开，”他低声说，“我不会像之前那样死去。但你的离去……会让我心痛。所以……我想是的。”

That's good to know, I guess; it's not just a one-way street. And it seems he really does trust me, with more than just his life and safety. Even I don't feel comfortable revealing that much to him about my own need.
得知这一点挺好的，看来这不是单方面的。他似乎真的非常信任我，不仅仅是生命安全，甚至更多。我自己也不太愿意向他透露太多关于我个人的需求。

"So what about you?" he murmurs after a moment. "Do you still think I'm pathetic?" Above and around us, leaves rustle, and a breeze carries the smell of pine.
"那你呢？"他片刻后轻声问道，"你现在还觉得我可怜吗？"头顶和四周，树叶轻响，微风送来了松树的清香。

I shake my head. "You're strong now."
我摇摇头说：“你现在变得坚强了。”

He doesn't answer, and I find myself just watching the motionless sprawl of suburban Tokyo-3 below. It's a strange situation I'm in now; I can understand, more or less, why he's done the stuff he has, why he's hurt me. And, as it happens, I don't really blame him anymore. If our positions had been reversed, I'd have done the same, or worse, and in fact I might have done worse anyway. As such, there's no reason to feel the anger that's dominated so much of the time I've spent around him in the past, and so that anger is now correspondingly absent.
他沉默不语，我只能凝视着东京-3 郊区那片静止的景象。我此刻的处境颇为微妙；我大致能理解他为何如此行事，为何伤我至此。然而，如今我已不再真正怪罪于他。若角色互换，我或许也会做出同样甚至更过激的行为，甚至可能本就做得更过分。既然如此，过去围绕他时充斥心头的怒火已无存在的理由，那份怒气自然也就消散了。

It's a... new feeling for me. A comfortable feeling.
这是一种全新的感受，让我感到十分舒适。

But first I have to make sure I'm right. First I need to take a risk, to expose some weakness. I think I have him figured out, at least for this stuff, but if not... this is going to hurt. "It's weird."
但首先我必须确认自己的判断无误。我得冒险一试，显露些许破绽。我觉得我已经看透了他，至少在当前这件事上，但若不然...那将是一记重击。"这事真奇怪。"

"Hmm? What is?" 嗯？这是什么？

I take a deep breath, then let it out slowly. "I... don't know what to do now," I admit, keeping my voice low and even. "We're set for supplies, so there's no real danger that we'll die anytime soon, but... I have no goals. For the first time in my life I have no Eva, nothing sitting in the future and putting everything else in perspective. I just... now that the trivial stuff is over, I don't even know where to start."
我深吸一口气，缓缓吐出。“我……现在真的不知道该怎么办，”我低声坦言，尽量保持语调平稳。“我们的物资充足，短期内不会有生命危险，但是……我失去了目标。有生以来第一次，我没有伊娃，没有未来的某件事物让其他一切都显得有意义。我只是……现在琐事都结束了，我甚至不知道该从哪里着手。”

There. What do you think of that, Shinji? I have weaknesses too, like you.
看那边。真嗣，你觉得如何？我也有和你一样的弱点。

"Really?" When I don't react, he sighs. "I don't get that at all, Asuka."
真的吗？"见我没反应，他叹了口气。"我实在搞不懂，明日香。

I turn my head fractionally towards him. "What do you mean?"
我略微侧头看向他，问道：“你指的是什么？”

He studies me sideways, then shrugs. "It's just that... you seem like you could do literally anything. I mean, even at the house, I thought it was weird that you still wanted to pilot when there were so many other things you could do. But now, after it's been so long and the world is still so empty..." He forces a laugh, shaking his head as he squints off over the ridge. "Look, I have no idea how a desalination plant works. The world needs fresh water now way more than it needs Eva pilots, so you're like... a hero. And all I am is some kid. So if you don't know what to do, I'm guessing it's because you have too many options to choose from, not too few."
他侧目审视我，随后耸肩道：“只是……你似乎无所不能。记得在家时，你明明有众多选择，却仍想驾驶 Eva，我就觉得奇怪。如今，时过境迁，世界依旧空荡……”他苦笑一声，摇头眯眼望向山脊。“说实话，我对海水淡化厂一窍不通。现在世界更需要的是淡水，而非 Eva 驾驶员，所以你简直是……英雄。而我，不过是个孩子。若你迷茫，想必是因为选择太多，而非太少。”

My face gets inexplicably tight at this, and I'm careful not to look at him. A hero? No one's ever really... ever really talked to me like that. I mean, Kaji used to when I would ace college exams and stuff, but it didn't feel like this does. Not this sincere.
我的脸不由自主地绷紧了，我小心地避开他的目光。英雄？从来没人这么...这么认真地和我谈过。我是说，以前我大学考试得高分时，Kaji 也会夸我，但那感觉和现在不同。没有这么真挚。

"So it just seems weird to me that you'd worry," continues Shinji earnestly. "I mean, I'm not worried, and I'm not even you; I'm just with you. So, if anything... hey, are you okay?" He pauses, and I can feel his eyes on me. "Are you cr--?"
你这么担心，我觉得挺奇怪的，" 真嗣认真地说。"毕竟，我都不担心，何况我还不是你，只是陪着你而已。话说回来...嘿，你没事吧？" 他顿了顿，我能感受到他的目光。"你是不是...？

Squeezing my eyes shut, I lower my head, letting hair spill past my cheeks and into my lap. Okay, so... I guess that answers my question. He's safe. I trust him. The guy who tried to kill me.
我紧闭双眼，垂下头，让发丝从脸颊滑落到膝上。看来，这已经解答了我的疑惑。他是可靠的。我信任他，那个曾企图置我于死地的人。

Does that make me an idiot? Or are friends supposed to look past stuff like that?
这是否说明我愚蠢？朋友难道不应该对这种事视而不见吗？

Clothing shifts beside me. "I'm sorry, Asuka; I didn't mean to... to, um... we can talk about something else, if you want."
衣物在我身旁微微挪动。“抱歉，明日香；我并非有意...有意，嗯...如果你想，我们可以换个话题聊聊。”

Rolling my eyes, I shake my head and deliver an absent backhanded slap to his knee. "I'm going to go back to reading," I decide. There's nothing else I really need to get out of him, is there?
我翻了个白眼，摇摇头，随手拍了拍他的膝盖。“我还是继续看书吧，”我决定。我似乎没什么需要再从他那里了解的了，不是吗？

"Okay." He chuckles, obviously relieved. "Or we could find some lunch."
好的。"他笑着，明显感到宽慰。"或者我们也可以去吃午饭。

"I'm not hungry yet." I actually feel a little drained; if anything, I could almost go for a nap, though it's probably not even noon.
我现在还不饿。说实话，我感到有些疲倦；如果可以的话，我真想小憩片刻，虽然现在可能连中午都还没到。

"Okay," he repeats happily, stretching out on the ground beside me. He's hungry, but he's willing to wait for me. "Let me know, then."
好的，"他再次愉快地说道，躺在我身旁的地面上。虽然饿了，但他愿意等我。"告诉我一声就行。

I nod, swinging my head slowly to regard my manga lying where I left it a few meters away, before the argument. After a moment I rise, touching Shinji's shoulder briefly, and go join it. When I find where I left off, the impetus to read just isn't there. Again.
我微微点头，目光缓缓移向几米外我之前放下的漫画，那是在争执之前。过了一会儿，我站起身，轻拍了下真嗣的肩膀，便走过去拿起漫画。找到上次读到的地方，却发现阅读的兴致又一次荡然无存。

Instead, despite the open book in my lap I find my eyes drawn to Shinji just lying there sprawled, apparently engrossed in his own reading. He's a mystery now, somehow, an anomaly, an exclamation point with no words preceding it. I'd expected to spend the rest of my life just barely tolerating him, keeping my loathing in check, but now it occurs to me that I might actually... enjoy hanging out with him. And I don't really even know how it got to this point.
实际上，尽管书本摊开在我膝上，我的视线却不自觉地转向了躺在那里的真嗣，他似乎正沉浸在自己的阅读中。他现在变得神秘莫测，仿佛成了一个突兀的感叹号，前无铺垫。我曾以为余生都要勉强忍受他，压抑自己的反感，但现在我突然意识到，我可能真的……享受与他相处的时光。至于这一切是如何发生的，我竟也说不清楚。

Eventually I shake my head slightly and frown at the open pages before me. This'll take some getting used to.
我最终微微摇头，对着摊开的书页皱眉。看来得花些时间才能适应。

### Chapter 13 Tranquillo E Dolce (Reprise)
静谧温柔（重奏版）

"Shinji, I'm hungry now."
真嗣，我现在有点饿了。

I blink up from my book, but Asuka's just watching me patiently. Finally I nod, not entirely certain why she needed my agreement. "Okay." Pushing myself to my feet, I head for our now-organized stack of food stocks. "What do you want? Canned pineapple, canned mushrooms, canned lychees, canned oranges or canned red beans?"
我合上书本，抬头望去，只见明日香正耐心地注视着我。我最终点了点头，心中却不太明白她为何需要我的首肯。“好的。”我站起身，走向我们整理得井井有条的食品储备。“你想吃什么？是罐头菠萝、罐头蘑菇、罐头荔枝、罐头橙子，还是罐头红豆？”

She makes an uncomfortable face at this, then sighs. "Just throw me the chips."
她对此皱了皱眉，叹息道：“把筹码扔给我吧。”

"What?" I grimace. "You know those aren't very g--"
什么？" 我皱起眉头，"你明知道那些并不怎么……

"Bite me. Just throw them over." The usual heat is gone from her voice.
"随你便。直接扔过来就行。" 她声音中的惯常热情已不复存在。

Shaking my head, I do as she asks, then pull out some pineapple for myself. With can opener and chopsticks in hand I drop to the ground next to her, and she doesn't say anything about it. I remember a time when if I'd sat anywhere near her it would have earned me a shrill tirade and maybe a bruise or two.
我摇了摇头，还是照她的吩咐做了，随后给自己取了些菠萝。手持开罐器和筷子，我蹲在她身旁，她对此并未置词。回想以前，若是我坐得离她近了，定会引来一阵尖刻的责骂，说不定还得挨上几下。

We eat in silence. Or at least I do; she crunches absently through her damn chips. I didn't even look to see what kind they were, but they smell like something only a European would eat, like salt-and-animal-intestine flavor or something. If they make her happy, though, I'm not going to complain.
我们默默地用餐。至少我是如此；她心不在焉地嚼着那些薯片。我连看都没看是什么牌子，但那气味像是只有欧洲人会喜欢的，像是盐味混合着动物内脏的味道。只要她高兴，我便不会有什么怨言。

I don't know that she is happy, though. A cautious sideways glance shows her face to be subdued and unreadable, staring at nothing as she eats. She doesn't seem angry, though she certainly has any number of reasons to be mad at me. If anything she just seems thoughtful.
尽管如此，我并不确定她是否真的快乐。谨慎地偷瞄一眼，她的表情平静而难以解读，一边用餐，一边眼神空洞地望着前方。她看起来并不生气，虽然她完全有理由对我发怒。或许，她只是沉浸在深思之中。

I guess I'm feeling a little contemplative as well, at the moment. I have to admit I have no idea what to expect from her anymore. She seems to like picking fights, but then afterwards we somehow both end up less angry than before. I'm actually a little surprised she didn't ask me about the strangling before, like right away, but whatever the reason, it's probably for the best; I doubt I could have explained it nearly so thoroughly right afterwards.
我想我现在也有些沉思，说实话，我对她已无从预料。她似乎爱挑起争端，但事后我们俩却莫名地比之前更平和。我其实有点意外她之前没马上追问关于勒脖子的事，但无论出于何种原因，这或许是最好的；我怀疑当时我根本无法解释清楚。

I can't believe I got so angry explaining it even now, though. Maybe it was just... curdling inside or something. Either that or her obvious disgust just pissed me off again.
真不敢相信，即便现在解释起来，我还是如此愤怒。可能是因为内心积怨已久，或者她那明显的厌恶感再次激起了我的怒火。

Really, I've... done a lot of stuff to her I'm not proud of. I'm glad she's still around, though.
说实话，我...对她做过不少令我羞愧的事。所幸她还在我身边，这让我感到欣慰。

Eventually she seems to finish eating, rolling the opened top of the bag halfheartedly down to its middle. After a moment she holds an open hand out to me, fingers twitching towards her palm in the universal "gimme" gesture. Her wrist is actually sitting on my leg, near my knee, but she doesn't seem to care.
她终于吃完了，漫不经心地卷起袋口至中间。片刻后，她向我摊开手掌，手指轻抽向掌心，做出那个通用的“给我”手势。她的手腕正搭在我腿上，靠近膝盖，但她似乎对此毫不在意。

Rather than give her the can, I instead turn my head to face her, then lift my eyebrows insolently as I pop another piece of pineapple into my mouth. She just stares back at me without expression, blue eyes barely blinking, new birthmark half-concealed by a spill of red hair. I chew slowly, maintaining eye contact.
我没有把罐头递给她，而是转过头直视她，挑衅地扬起眉毛，同时又往嘴里塞了一块菠萝。她面无表情地回望着我，蓝眼睛几乎不眨，新生的胎记半掩在红色发丝下。我慢慢咀嚼，始终保持眼神接触。

She touches me now. I wonder if this goes both ways.
她此刻正触碰我，我在想这种感觉是否是相互的。

After a moment I offer a smile and hand the can of pineapple out to her. She swipes it without a word, then turns to stare out at the city as she eats from it.
片刻后，我微笑着递给她一罐菠萝。她默默接过，随即转身凝视着城市，边吃边眺望。

She uses my chopsticks now. I figured that would at least warrant a snide remark.
她现在用我的筷子，我以为这至少会招来几句尖酸的评论。

Bored, I grab the bag of chips from in front of her, then try one. I'm... not too thrilled, I find. When Asuka finishes the pineapple pieces, I steal the can back from her and drink the syrup just to wash the taste out of my mouth.
感到无聊，我伸手从她面前拿过那袋薯片，尝了一片。感觉并不怎么吸引我。等明日香吃完菠萝块，我趁机把罐子夺回来，喝下里面的糖浆，只想冲掉口中那股味道。

After rinsing the can out and tossing it into our trash pile, I go back to my book and Asuka does the same. Once again a complete silence descends over our campsite.
将罐子冲洗干净并丢入垃圾堆后，我继续看书，飞鸟亦是如此。营地又一次笼罩在一片静谧之中。

This is killing me. Just like when she first came back to me, I'm burning with things I could be asking her or telling her. Foremost among my curiosity, of course, is the key question: what the hell is going on, anyway? What is all this? I don't feel comfortable breaching the topic yet, though; after this last argument, it feels like we've reached some silent accord and I am loath to break it. Despite her heated accusations earlier she seems content now, like all she wanted to do was get the matter off her chest.
这简直让我难受至极。就像她初次回到我身边时一样，我心中充满了无数想要询问或告诉她的事情。我最为好奇的，自然是那个核心问题：究竟是怎么回事？这一切意味着什么？然而，我仍未感到是时候去触及这个话题；经过上一次争执，我们仿佛达成了某种默契，我不愿轻易打破。尽管她之前情绪激烈地指责过，但现在她似乎已经释然，仿佛她只是想把心事倾吐出来。

Needless to say, I don't get much reading done. I'm sure she doesn't either.
显然，我读书的时间不多。她肯定也一样。

After dinner, we end up just sitting together next to the firepit once more. Even though dusk has stolen all but the last fading fire of the sun's presence, with our own blaze it would be more than bright enough to play cards or something. I wonder if she even wants to.
饭后，我们又围坐在火坑边。虽然夜幕已将夕阳的余晖几乎完全遮掩，但我们的篝火足够明亮，足以让我们玩牌或进行其他活动。不知道她是否也有此意。

"Shinji." Her low murmur dispels my introspection. "I can trust you, can't I?"
真嗣。" 她轻声细语打断了我的沉思。"我能够信任你，对吗？

"What?" Frowning, I turn to give her a questioning look, but she's just nodding slightly back at me like the question is already settled and she's just waiting for me to say so. "Trust me how?" I figured there would be another conversation coming tonight -- earlier I saw her staring at me for over half an hour straight for no reason -- but I had no idea what it would be about.
"什么？"我皱眉转向她，带着疑问的眼神，而她只是微微点头，仿佛问题已定，只待我确认。"要如何信任你？"我预感今晚还有另一场对话——之前她无缘无故盯着我看了半个多小时——但我对话题一无所知。

"You know," she clarifies, shrugging. "Trust you."
你明白的，" 她解释着，肩膀微微一耸。"我相信你。

I nod slowly, trying to clear my frown. Thanks, Asuka. "I'm not planning to hurt you, if that's what you mean," I explain, "and I wouldn't... betray you or anything." I reserve the right to hurt her through my own stupidity, though; I can't guarantee not to do a thing like that.
我慢慢地点头，努力平复皱起的眉头。谢谢你，明日香。“我无意伤害你，如果这是你的顾虑，”我解释说，“我也不会……背叛你或做出类似的事情。”但我也承认，我可能会因为自己的愚蠢而伤害到她；这一点我无法保证不会发生。

She merely nods once more, eyes going distant. "I know. Shinji... I'm scarred."
她再次微微颔首，目光飘渺。“我明白。真嗣...我心有余悸。”

"What do you mean, scarred?" Scarred inside? I think everyone in the world will be, after Instrumentality.
你指的'伤痕'是什么？内心的创伤吗？经历了人类补完计划，我想世界上每个人都会有所感受。

Her lips tighten in frustration, like she thinks I'm being dumb on purpose, but rather than answer she scrambles around to kneel facing me. Crossing arms over her stomach, she grips the bottom of her shirt, a plain black thing with a pink teddy bear on the chest, and starts pulling it over her head.
她因挫败而紧抿双唇，似乎觉得我是故意装傻，但她并未回应，而是迅速转身跪着面向我。她双臂交叉护住腹部，抓住那件胸前印有粉色泰迪熊的普通黑色 T 恤，开始往上拉，试图脱掉。

I watch in paralyzed fascination, but she's wearing that blue swim top on underneath it. Of course she is. Why wouldn't she wear something? As she tosses the shirt aside, though, I can see exactly what she's talking about, and she even kneels upright to let me see better.
我被深深吸引，目不转睛地看着，她确实在里面穿了那件蓝色的泳衣。她自然会穿些什么。当她将衬衫抛开时，我立刻明白了她的意图，她甚至挺直身子跪着，以便我看得更清楚。

She's... pink. Mostly pink, anyway, from the waistline of her jeans up to shortly below where the shirt used to cover, and the discoloration reaches from side to side, wrapping almost around to her back in some places. The edges of these overlapping marks are jagged, even angular, calling to mind the shapes of stab or bite wounds. I know exactly how they all got there, too. I saw her Eva after it was nearly skeletonized by the feasting mass-produced units.
她...呈现出一种粉色。主要是粉色，从牛仔裤腰线往上，到衬衫原本覆盖处稍下方，变色区域横跨两侧，有些地方几乎环绕至背部。这些重叠痕迹的边缘参差不齐，甚至尖锐，让人想起刺伤或咬伤的形状。我清楚这些痕迹的来历。我曾目睹她的 Eva，在被大量生产的单位几乎啃食成骨架后的模样。

These are her wounds. She carried them with her.
这些伤口属于她。她一直携带着它们。

This... really must have messed her up. Maybe I can help somehow, though.
这...肯定让她很受打击。不过，或许我还能帮上忙。

She's watching me, waiting for a response of some sort. Leaning in, I study her skin a little more closely. "These are like the ones on your face and hand, right?"
她正注视着我，期待着某种回应。我凑近一些，更细致地观察她的皮肤。“这些和你脸上和手上的那些是一样的吧？”

"Yeah." 对。

I lift a hand, and when she doesn't move away, I touch skin on the left side of her stomach. It's smooth, not like scar tissue at all, and faint goosebumps even form briefly in the aftermath of my touch. "These aren't scars," I decide softly, unable to look away, or to move my hand away. "They're birthmarks."
我伸手触摸，她并未退避，我便轻触她腹部左侧的肌肤。那肌肤光滑细腻，全无疤痕的痕迹，甚至因我的触碰而短暂泛起微小的鸡皮疙瘩。“这不是疤痕，”我轻声自语，目光无法移开，手也舍不得离开。“这是胎记。”

"They weren't there when I was born," she counters flatly. "They're scars."
我出生时他们并不在场，"她平淡地反驳，"那些是伤疤。

As she talks I slide my hand around until I'm almost gripping her by the small of the waist, but she still doesn't make any move to pull back. I'm... touching her. And she's letting me. I feel like I'm petting a wild tiger and somehow not getting mauled.
她说话间，我轻手轻脚地将手移至她腰际，几乎要环抱住她的纤腰，而她并未有丝毫退缩。我在触碰她，她默许了。这感觉就像抚摸着一只野生老虎，却不可思议地未遭其攻击。

This is the closest she's ever let me get to her. Even the kiss was more guarded.
这是她允许我接近她最近的一次，连那个吻都带着几分戒备。

After a moment I close my eyes... and can't even tell the difference between her marks and normal skin. She's really worried about this?
过了一会儿，我闭上眼，竟分不清她的痕迹和普通皮肤有何不同。她真的为此忧心忡忡吗？

Swallowing, I glance up, and find that she's staring down at me, almost scowling, eyes hard and glittering with reflected firelight. She's waiting for me to say something else, daring me to say the wrong thing.
我咽了口唾沫，抬头望去，只见她正俯视着我，眉头微蹙，眼神冷硬，火光在其眼中闪烁。她似乎在期待我继续说下去，又像是在挑衅我，看我是否会失言。

She doesn't want sympathy; if so, she'd have shown me before. She doesn't want to hear that they're not that big of a deal; that would mean that they are an issue, just not much of one. She doesn't want an assurance that she's still beautiful; again, that implies that there's something to be beautiful despite, and she wouldn't believe me anyway.
她并不寻求同情，若真需要，之前就会向我表露。她不愿听人说那些事无关紧要，因为这等于承认它们是问题，只是不那么严重。她也不想听到自己依旧美丽的安慰，这反而意味着存在需要克服的瑕疵，何况她根本不会相信我的话。

Eventually I nod, letting my hand drop from her skin, not without regret. "Yeah, they're there," I acknowledge plainly, meeting her gaze. "They concern you somehow, do they?"
我最终点了点头，带着些许遗憾，将手从她的肌肤上移开。“嗯，它们确实在那儿，”我直视她的眼睛，坦诚地说。“这些事和你有关，对吧？”

Her eyes narrow further, if possible, like she's thinking through my words from every possible angle to find all imaginable insult therein. I just stare back up at her, acutely aware that she's almost half-naked, trying desperately to keep from thinking about it. Is she prolonging this on purpose? Just to mess with me?
她的眼睛仿佛进一步眯起，似乎在从每个角度审视我的话，寻找其中可能的侮辱。我抬头回望，心中清楚她几乎半裸，努力克制自己不去想这件事。她是有意拖延吗？只是为了戏弄我？

Eventually, though, she snorts, even chuckling; a smile curves her lips, small but genuine. With a shake of her head she sits back down where she was; one hand grabs her shirt from where it lies, and she proceeds unhurriedly to slip it back on.
最终，她还是忍不住嗤笑出声，甚至轻笑起来；嘴角勾起一抹微笑，虽小却真挚。她摇了摇头，重新坐回原位；一只手拿起衬衫，从容地重新穿上。

I try to conceal a relieved sigh, instead staring contemplatively into the fire. Wow. That's, um... that's a new one. I'm sure the marks are what's on her mind, but I'm still stunned she just stripped out of her shirt in front of me. I feel bad brushing aside the birthmarks and focusing on that... but isn't that what she wanted? For it not to matter to me?
我努力掩饰内心的释然，转而凝视着火堆陷入沉思。哇，这，呃……真是头一回。我猜她心里惦记的是那些胎记，但我还是被她当着我的面脱掉衬衫的举动惊到了。我为自己忽视了胎记而感到内疚……但这不正是她所期望的吗？希望我对此视而不见？

Once clothed again, she settles into place beside me, likewise staring at the crackling blaze in the firepit. "They... start down here," she adds softly, touching her hip just below where it starts curving back in, "and go up."
重新穿戴好后，她在我身边坐下，目光与我一同落在火坑中跳跃的火焰上。“它们...从这儿开始，”她轻声说着，手指轻触臀部曲线开始内收的位置，“然后一路向上。”

I nod. "So... everything between, um, is still... uh..."
我点头道：“也就是说... 嗯，中间的部分还是... 那个...”

"Yeah. It's still functional."
对，它还能正常工作。

"Okay. Yeah." I take a deep breath, then blow it out.
"好的，是的。" 我深吸一口气，再缓缓呼出。

"Perv." 首次提及

"Whatever." It was a valid question, though I suppose if there were any other problems, I'd have heard about it long before now. "Wanna play cards or something?"
无所谓。" 这确实是个合理的问题，但如果还有其他问题，我应该早就知道了。 "想玩牌还是做点别的？

She shifts vaguely. "Strip poker? Is that what you were hoping for?" Despite her accusatory words, her tone is just... conversational. Like this is normal.
她略微挪动了一下，语气平淡地问：“脱衣扑克？你是在期待这个吗？”虽然话语中带有责问，但她的语气却如同闲谈一般，仿佛这是再平常不过的事情。

I give her a doubtful sideways glance; I'm trying to move onto a lighter topic, and she's not letting me. "You're still on that?"
我带着疑虑瞥了她一眼；本想换个轻松的话题，她却不肯放过。“你还在纠结那件事？”

Blue eyes slide to meet mine. "Still on what?" The faintest outline of a smile touches her lips.
她的蓝眼睛转向我，与我目光相遇。“还在琢磨什么呢？”她唇边隐约浮现出一抹微笑。

Despite myself I laugh, then shift my gaze back to the fire and laugh quietly again. "Okay. Strip poker if you want, but I was going to say something like war, or speed."
我不由自主地笑了，随后目光再次转向火堆，又轻声笑了起来。“行吧，如果你想玩脱衣扑克那就玩，不过我本想提议玩点像战争或速度那样的游戏。”

"Fine." She sighs sharply, giving her hair an absent toss. "We'll start with war. You're right; we can work our way up to the rest."
行吧。"她重重地叹息一声，随意地甩了甩头发。"那就从战争谈起。你说的没错，我们可以逐步展开其他话题。

My God. She's... she's teasing, right? I can't even tell from her voice; she sounds serious. "We, um... yeah, I'll get the cards." Swallowing, I hop to my feet before she can say anything else, then rummage around in one of the backpacks.
天哪，她是在...逗我玩吧？她的语气让我捉摸不透，听起来一本正经。“我们，呃...行，我去拿牌。”我咽了口唾沫，赶紧起身，免得她再说什么，随后便在一个背包里翻找起来。

When I get back to the fire, Asuka has dragged her sleeping bag over, and is busy shaking it clean of dirt and pine needles. At my frown, she pauses and gestures vaguely, an effort ruined somewhat by the fact that she's still holding the thing with both hands. "We don't want cards on the ground, Professor. Unless you want to clean them all off after we play."
我回到篝火边时，明日香正拖着睡袋，忙着抖落上面的尘土和松针。见我皱眉，她停下手中的动作，尽管双手仍抓着睡袋，还是尽力解释道：“教授，我们总不能把牌直接放地上吧，除非你想玩完后还得一一清理。”

I say nothing, just stare back at her, and after a moment she grumbles something and resumes getting our playing surface ready. When she's done, I sit cross-legged on one end and start getting the cards out of the box.
我沉默不语，只是静静地回望她，片刻后她嘟囔着继续整理我们的游戏桌面。待她准备妥当，我便盘腿坐下，开始从盒中取出卡片。

"Take your shoes off when you're on my bed," scolds Asuka, following her own advice before sitting to face me. "Dolt."
上我的床前先把鞋子脱了，"飞鸟一边责怪一边自己照做，然后坐下来面对我。"真是的。

Pausing, I give her an incredulous look. "Asuka... the other whole side of this thing is on the ground. I'm not making it dirtier."
我停下脚步，用难以置信的眼神看着她。“明日香...这东西的另一面已经全在地上。我并没有让它变得更脏。”

"And yet the soles of your shoes can catch on the surface," she continues evenly, "and I don't want it torn because of your numbskullery. Aces are high."
但你的鞋底可能会勾住表面，"她语气平稳地接着说，"我不想因为你的粗心大意而损坏它。A 最大。

"Fine." Tossing the card box at her, I instead start tugging my shoes off. When I'm ready, she's shuffling the cards. She's better than I am, I can see; she can bridge them back into place after a round of shuffling, which I lack the dexterity to do.
"好的。" 我随手将牌盒抛给她，转而开始脱鞋。待我准备就绪，她已开始熟练地洗牌。显然，她在这方面比我更胜一筹；她能在一轮洗牌后巧妙地将牌归位，而我则自愧不如。

Shortly she starts dealing. Since the cards are new, they want to slide over each other after she tosses each one to me, but I just let them accumulate. Soon twenty-six copies of the same cigarette company logo are staring up at me, and I neaten them up into a pile before placing my first card opposite hers.
不久她便开始发牌。新牌滑腻，每发一张给我，它们都试图彼此滑过，但我任其堆积。转眼间，二十六张印着同一家烟草公司标志的牌面朝上，我将其整理成叠，随后在她对面放下我的首张牌。

"I've never played speed before," she admits as she collects both cards and places another. "How is it you know a game I don't?"
我以前从没玩过速战速决，" 她一边收牌一边承认，接着又放了一张。"你怎么知道连我都不了解的游戏呢？

I smile to myself; one of the reasons I suggested a silly game like this is that you can't help but talk during it, and I was tired of the silence. "I learned it from Kensuke."
我暗自微笑；之所以提议玩这种幼稚的游戏，是因为它迫使你开口说话，我已厌倦了沉默。"这招是跟健介学的。"

"That's even worse," she mutters, collecting the second trick as well. "How does Kensuke know a game I don't?"
这更糟糕了，"她低声抱怨，同时收起了第二轮的牌。"健介怎么知道我不懂的游戏？

"Beats me. He went through a phase where he wanted to learn card tricks." I think back for a moment, then shrug. "So every day at lunch he'd try to show Toji and me a new one. Only he wasn't very good, so usually we just played actual card games afterwards."
我也不太清楚。他曾一度热衷于学习纸牌魔术。" 我稍作回忆，随即耸了耸肩。"那段时间，他每天午餐时都试图给我们和东治表演新学的魔术。可惜他技艺不佳，多数时候我们还是转而玩起了普通的纸牌游戏。

"That sounds about right." She smiles slightly, shuffling a fifth trick into her victory pile; I've only taken three. "How do you play it?"
听起来挺对的。"她嘴角微扬，把第五轮的牌添进她的胜局堆；我只赢了三轮。"你这招怎么玩的？

"Um..." I watch, frowning, as she collects a sixth trick. "Basically there are two face-up cards in the middle, and two face-down piles. We each have a hand, and you're always trying to get rid of your cards by putting them onto the face-up piles. It's kind of hard to... I'll just show you later, when this game is done."
我皱着眉头，看着她拿下第六墩。'简单说，中间有两张明牌，还有两叠暗牌。我们各持一手牌，目标是通过出牌到明牌堆来清空手牌。解释起来有点复杂...等这局结束，我直接演示给你看。'

She shrugs. "Fine. Shouldn't be too long anyway; I'm crushing you."
她耸耸肩说：“行吧。反正也用不了多久；我可是占尽上风。”

I laugh. "In a game that's totally random. Good work."
我笑道："在这完全碰运气的游戏里，表现不错。"

"Ah," she sighs, neatening her victory pile. "Totally random, is it? I dealt, didn't I?"
啊，" 她轻叹一声，整理着她的战利品。"真是随机的吗？牌不是我发的吗？

"Yeah, but I watched you," I counter. "I don't think you're good enough to stack the deck when I'm watching you shuffle."
没错，但我全程都在盯着你，"我反驳说。"我觉得在我眼皮底下，你还没法巧妙地操纵牌局。

She grins at me, eyes glittering. "We'll see, won't we?"
她朝我咧嘴一笑，眼中闪着光。“咱们走着瞧，对吧？”

What a smartass. "I suppose we will."
真是自以为是。"看来我们得这么做了。"

"Yeah. Where were you?" 对啊，你刚才在哪儿呢？

"What?" 什么？

"When I fought the mass-produced Evas. Where were you?"
我与量产型 Eva 激战之际，你身在何方？

I blink, just staring at her for the moment it takes me to process this radical leap in topics. She seems to be paying attention to the game, though, only bothering to meet my gaze when I don't answer right away, and even then she just waits patiently for me. "I... I couldn't get to my Eva." My voice has dropped to a whisper.
我眨了眨眼，愣愣地看着她，用了片刻时间来适应话题的突然转变。她似乎正全神贯注于游戏，只有在我没有立即回应时，她才不情愿地抬起头与我对视，即便如此，她也只是耐心地等待着。“我……我没能找到我的伊娃。”我的声音已经低至耳语。

Her brows draw together at this. "Why not?"
她对此眉头紧锁，问道：“为什么不行？”

"Bakelite." I swallow, absently fingering the card on top of my pile. "I think the JSSDF put it there."
电木。" 我咽了咽口水，无意识地拨弄着那叠卡片顶端的一张。"我猜是日本自卫队放置的。

"Bakelite? Then how did I get into mine?" By her tone, I could almost doubt we're talking about what I was doing when she was killed. "You must have been late, if they were able to flood the chamber between our launches. Why? And are you going to play a card or what?"
胶木？那我是怎么进到我的舱室的？"听她的语气，我差点以为我们谈的不是她遇害时我在做什么。"你肯定是迟了，不然他们怎么会在我们发射间隔把舱室灌满。为什么？你到底出不出牌？

I twitch, then flip over a seven and lose it against Asuka's queen. "I was... basically... paralyzed with guilt over having... um, masturbated over you." There; I can say it aloud, without euphemisms. "And killing Kaworu." That's something else I feel awful about, but... there's not much I can do about it now. And I'd probably still do the same if given the choice again. "So Misato physically dragged me there, then slammed me into the elevator and... and died, I think. She'd been shot."
我抽搐了一下，翻出一张七，却败给了明日香的皇后。“那时我……几乎……因对你……嗯，自慰而深感愧疚。”终于，我能坦白说出，无需避讳。“还有杀害薰。”这也是我痛心疾首的事，然而……如今已无能为力。若重来一次，我恐怕仍会如此选择。“美里硬是把我拽到那儿，推进电梯后……我想她牺牲了。她中弹了。”

Asuka pauses at this, then makes a face. "That sucks. I just figured she got swept up with everyone else."
明日香顿了顿，随即露出不悦的神色。"真倒霉。我原以为她只是跟其他人一样被牵连了。"

"Yeah, well... a bullet or a visit from Rei, it's all the same in the end, I suppose." I shake my head.
"是啊，子弹也好，零的造访也罢，归根结底都一样吧。" 我摇了摇头。

"I suppose." She chews a lip, waiting while we turn our victory piles into operating piles. "So basically you couldn't get to your Eva in time to help me when I was awake, because you were sulking over how you'd hurt me when I was sedated."
我想应该是这样。" 她轻咬着唇，看着我们把赢来的筹码重新分配。"也就是说，你没能及时赶到你的伊娃那里帮我，因为你在为我在昏迷时受到的伤害而自责。

"Um... yeah." 嗯... 对。

"Good work, Shinji." 干得好，真嗣。

"Yeah." I manage to win a trick, and as I'm sweeping the cards to my new victory pile I glance up at Asuka, only to find she's watching my hands. Watching the order I put the cards away in. What the hell? "Asuka... are you counting cards?"
嗯，我赢了一局。"当我把牌扫进新的胜利堆时，抬头一看，发现明日香正盯着我的手，似乎在观察我收牌的顺序。这是怎么回事？"明日香...你是在记牌吗？

Blue eyes dart sharply to my own; she's probably surprised I noticed. Then she grins. "When you're as smart as I am, everything is easy."
她那双蓝眼睛敏锐地转向我，或许惊讶于我竟察觉到了。接着，她露出了笑容：“像我这样聪明，做任何事都轻而易举。”

I stare at her blankly for a moment, then at my deck. "You... know exactly what I have right now," I realize. "Don't you."
我愣愣地看了她一会儿，接着目光转向我的牌组。"你...分明清楚我手头有什么，"我恍然大悟。"对吧。"

"Yeah. Twenty-one cards." She frowns briefly at one of her fingernails. "On top is the ace of diamonds. Then the four of clubs. Jack of clubs. Six of spades. Nine of--"
对，一共二十一张牌。"她瞥了一眼自己的指甲，眉头微蹙，"最上面是方块 A，其次是梅花 4，然后是梅花 J，接着是黑桃 6，再下面是红心 9……

"Right. I get it." Flipping over my top card, I slump slightly on seeing it's the ace of diamonds. Asuka flips over the three of hearts, then shrugs when I collect. She's arranging her own spoils to match up against mine, to minimize my gains and maximize hers. "Asuka, you suck."
没错，我懂了。" 我翻开顶牌，发现是红心 A，不禁有些泄气。明日香翻出红心 3，见我收牌，她只是耸了耸肩。她正整理自己的牌，以便与我的牌对抗，目的是减少我的收益，同时增加她的收益。"明日香，你真是不留情面。

"You only wish." She doesn't even have the grace to smile when the next trick results in a war that nets her five of my own cards. "So you got to the Eva cage and just sat there, or what? Was the JSSDF still there? I know they moved out when the MP Evas showed up, or around then."
你不过是空想罢了。" 当她因下一招引发的战争而赢得我五张牌时，她连个微笑都吝啬。"所以你到了伊娃的笼子，就只是干坐着，还是怎样？日本自卫队那时还在吗？我记得 MP 伊娃一出现，他们就撤了，或者差不多那时候。

"Yeah, I sat there." Another trick wins me a five, with a six. "I sat and listened to you fight and win, and then lose. And then I listened to Maya losing it on the net because your power ran out and they started to eat you."
对，我当时就坐在那儿。又用一招赢了五分，还带着六分。我听着你们先是争执、获胜，随后又败下阵来。然后我听到玛雅因为你的电量耗尽而在网上情绪失控，他们开始对你不利。

I'm not watching her face, but her hands tremble briefly at my words. "Yeah, I... remember that." Her voice is soft, her tone thoughtful. She pauses, but only for a moment, before her next card finds its way to our synthetic playing surface. "Then how did you get into Unit-01?"
我没看她的脸，但她的手因我的话而微微颤抖。“嗯，我……记得那件事。”她的声音轻柔，带着沉思。她停顿了片刻，随即下一张牌便落在了我们的人造游戏桌上。“那你当初是怎么进入初号机的？”

"It... moved by itself," I explain. "By herself, to break the Bakelite and let me in. I did all of that stuff at the end without a power cable or battery backup."
它...竟然自己动了，"我解释说。"是她自己，为了打破酚醛塑料让我进去。我最后做的那些操作，都没有依靠电源线或备用电池。

She snorts. "You have all the luck. I didn't get Unit-02 to do that until right before the white fuckers speared me to the ground."
她嗤笑道：“你运气真好。我直到那些白痴把我钉在地上前不久，才让二号机做到那一步。”

I shrug helplessly. "If I'm so lucky, why do I have only about a dozen cards left?"
我无奈地耸耸肩。“既然我这么幸运，怎么就剩十几张卡片了呢？”

"Because intelligence beats luck."
智慧胜于运气。

And yet intelligence didn't help her much in that last battle. I glance up, trying to think of a way not to kill the mood, and see she's smiling at me. There's a... a sad note in her eyes, though, that says she knows exactly what I'm thinking... but she's still smiling.
尽管智慧在那场决战中未能助她一臂之力，我抬头思索如何不扫兴，却见她对我微笑。她的眼中藏着一抹哀愁，似乎洞悉了我的心思...然而，她的笑容依旧。

After a moment I smile too, at the cards. "Yeah. Yeah, I guess it does."
片刻后，我也对着牌微笑起来。“嗯，确实如此。”

"Of course it does," she scoffs. "Would I say something like that if it weren't true?"
当然是真的，"她轻蔑地说。"如果不是真的，我怎么会这么说呢？

"Don't get me started." 别让我开始说。

"Alright, fine." She chuckles anyway, richly, as the spoils of another war go to her. "Poor Shinji. Do you want me to spot you a few cards?"
好吧，行吧。"她依旧笑得十分开怀，因为又一场战争的胜利果实落入了她的手中。"可怜的 Shinji，要不要我借你几张牌？

"Bite me." I've got just eight left, now. "Maybe we should forget cards, and tomorrow we'll play soccer or something."
来咬我啊。现在只剩八个了。或许我们该放下牌局，明天去踢踢足球或其他活动。

"Soccer, huh?" Her fingers tap thoughtfully against one knee. "You didn't get a pump for the ball, did you? If it's still in the box, I doubt it's fully inflated."
足球啊？" 她若有所思地轻敲膝盖。"你没给球充气吧？要是还在盒子里，估计气都没打足。

She has an answer for everything, doesn't she? "Yeah, well, maybe you're not fully-inflated either."
她似乎对任何问题都有答案，不是吗？"嗯，可能你也没完全鼓起来呢。"

"You don't think so?" she wonders, sounding genuinely curious. Leaving her cards alone for the moment, she once again cups her breasts thoughtfully. "Do you really think you're going to land someone better-inflated than me?"
你真这么认为吗？"她好奇地问，语气中透着真诚。她暂时将牌搁置一旁，再次若有所思地托起自己的胸部。"你真的觉得能找到比我更丰满的人？

"No," I groan. She's really flirty now. What changed?
"不，"我低声抱怨。她现在变得格外爱调情。是什么让她变了？

Sapphire eyes grin at me for the moment it takes her to remember our game. "Now let's get this rout over with so you can teach me how to slaughter you in speed."
她那蓝宝石般的眼睛狡黠地朝我一瞥，随即记起了我们的游戏。"快点结束这场较量吧，这样你就能教我如何迅速取胜了。"

"Fine," I sigh, trying not to sound too petulant. My next card is a jack, but loses to her king. At least now, with her, everything is over too quickly to hurt for very long.
"好吧，" 我叹息着，尽量不显得太孩子气。我下一张牌是杰克，却败给了她的国王。至少现在，和她一起，一切都结束得如此迅速，痛苦来不及蔓延。

### Chapter 14 Molto Allegro
极快板

When morning comes, I stretch and sit up, then start watching Shinji in his sleep. It no longer feels strange to do so.
清晨时分，我伸展身体坐起，随即开始静静地观察沉睡中的真嗣。如今，这已不再让我感到异样。

I find that I enjoyed last night. Immensely. Just sitting around, bullshitting with him over a few games of cards... I don't know why, but that was easily the must fun I've had in a very long time. Even now I'm looking forward to tonight because then I'll be able to do it again. If he wants to.
我发现自己对昨晚的时光感到异常享受。仅仅是围坐一起，与他闲谈，玩了几轮纸牌...不知何故，那成了我许久未有的最愉快的时光。此刻，我已迫不及待地期待今晚，希望能再次重温这份乐趣。当然，前提是他也有此意。

I think he does, though. He enjoys that sort of time together; I can see it in his face. He's not very good at keeping his thoughts to himself. Maybe tonight we can break out one of the board games, but if not, cards would be just as good. Really, the actual activity probably doesn't matter much; it's just a pretext to hang out. And we never got to play strip poker.
我觉得他确实乐在其中。他享受这样的相聚时光，从他的表情就能看出来。他不善于隐藏自己的心思。也许今晚我们可以玩一局桌游，如果不行，打牌也挺好。其实，具体玩什么可能并不重要，主要是为了找个理由聚一聚。而且我们还没试过玩脱衣扑克呢。

Sighing, I shake my head slightly without taking my eyes off the slumbering Shinji. I'm teasing him now when he isn't even awake, and I'm not talking. It just... comes so easily, now. So naturally. One of these days he's going to call me out on it, probably, tell me to put up or shut up. I wonder what I'll do when that happens. Back down, I suppose, for a while, and then just go back to doing it. It's too fun to stop, especially when he shoots back at me.
我轻叹一声，微微摇头，目光始终不离沉睡的真嗣。他尚未醒来，我已开始逗他，尽管我并未出声。这一切...如今显得那么自然，那么顺手。总有一天，他可能会对此提出质疑，或许会让我要么行动要么闭嘴。我好奇当那一刻来临时，我会如何应对。大概会暂时退让，然后又故态复萌。这太有趣了，尤其是当他反击时。

Gradually the eastern sky grows from black to navy to peach, though intervening trees still hide the sun. Shinji remains unmoving, sleeping on his side, facing me. I wonder if he fell asleep that way, watching me.
东方天空逐渐由黑转蓝，再染上桃红，尽管树木依旧遮住了太阳。真嗣静卧不动，侧身而眠，面朝着我。我不禁思索，他是否是看着我入睡的。

I'm waiting for him to wake up, I realize, for no other reason than that, when he does, I can start interacting with him again. I enjoy that so much. Why couldn't all our time before have been like this? Why just recently?
我在等他醒来，纯粹是因为他醒来后，我就能再次与他互动，对此我感到无比愉悦。为何我们之前的日子不能都如此美好？为何直到最近才体验到这份喜悦？

Oh yeah. All that, uh... all the stuff that happened.
哦，对。就是那些，呃...发生的一切。

Well, anyway. Things are a little different now. He's not really a bad guy, I don't think; he's just made a lot of mistakes. Like I have.
不管怎样，现在情况有所不同。他其实不算坏人，我认为；他只是犯了不少错误，就像我也犯过一样。

He hasn't stirred yet. He probably won't, not until I get up.
他还没动静。估计要等我起床后他才会动。

And really, I should do so shortly. Part of me would like nothing more than to spend another day slacking up here, but I'm hesitant actually to do that; if I get too lazy, it could rub off and laziness can probably kill us now. Also, having heard what Shinji thinks about my being able to do stuff... it makes me want to do it, to show him he's right.
确实，我应该不久后就会行动。我内心的一部分真的很想在这里再悠闲一天，但实际上我又有些迟疑；如果我过于懒散，这种态度可能会影响他人，而懒惰现在可能真的会危及我们。此外，听了真嗣对我能力的评价后...这让我更想付诸行动，向他证明他的看法没错。

Lips twisting idly, I climb out of my sleeping bag and slip shoes on. As soon as I start rummaging through my clothes, I can hear Shinji stirring and stretching behind me. "You awake?"
我嘴唇无意识地动了动，从睡袋中钻出，套上鞋子。刚一翻找衣物，便听见身后真嗣开始翻身伸懒腰。“你醒了？”

"Mmm. Yeah, now." 嗯，对，就是现在。

Nodding, I turn half-around to see him rubbing his eyes. "I want to get a generator today. What do you think?"
我点头，半转过身，见他正揉着眼睛。“我想今天去买个发电机，你怎么看？”

He pauses, then squints doubtfully at me. His hair is in total disarray, a casualty of sleep and hat-wearing. "Again? Do you have a better idea where to look this time?"
他顿了顿，眯起眼睛，带着几分疑虑望向我。头发凌乱不堪，显然是睡眠和帽子折腾的结果。“又要找？这次你有没有更明确的线索？”

"I... no." I wave a hand, dismissing that idea. "No, I've been thinking. It would probably be easier just to build one, using some whole components from other ones, and I've already seen what I need. So we don't need to go searching."
我...还是算了。" 我摆摆手，否定了那个提议。"不，我考虑过了。直接用现成的部件组装一个应该更简便，我心里已经有数了。我们不必再费力去找了。

"Oh." His skepticism disappears into a pleasant neutrality. "Sure. What do you want to use it for, though? We have a bunch of water already."
哦。" 他的疑虑消散，转而显得平和愉悦。"行啊。不过你打算用这些水做什么呢？我们这里水已经很多了。

"Proof of concept," I shrug, shuffling over to find our bathing supplies. "It'll give me something to think about, and I'm sure we'll find a use for it. And anyway, if I hook a pump up to it, I could make a thing that just sat in or next to the water, and slowly filled a reservoir of clean water. Every now and then we could have actual showers."
这只是个概念验证，"我边说边走向存放洗浴用品的地方。"它能让我有些思考的素材，我确信我们会找到它的用处。再说，如果我给它装个泵，就能造出一个装置，放在水边，缓缓地向储水池注入清水。这样我们就能时不时享受真正的淋浴了。

"Oh." He sounds impressed at this. "I wouldn't say no to that."
哦。" 他听起来对此颇为赞赏。"我当然不会拒绝。

"I didn't mean together, smartass."
我不是那个意思，别自作聪明。

"Sure you didn't." 你肯定没做。

Smiling at the supplies in my hands, I rise to my feet without looking at him. "I'm going to wash up. I won't be long." As I head into the trees, I blink, then frown. I didn't tell him not to peek, did I?
我手里捧着补给品，面带微笑地站了起来，没去看他。“我去洗洗，很快回来。”走进树林时，我眨了眨眼，随即皱起眉头。我好像忘了告诉他别偷看，是吧？

Enh. He'll be fine. 没事，他会好的。

After a quick scrubdown and a clean t-shirt, I wander back to the campsite and throw my wet stuff over the clothesline. What am I going to need today, then? I don't want to build an entire internal combustion engine, even if I could, so that much I'll have to scrounge, at least. The problem is that most aren't going to be sitting around; they're going to be in cars, and in other generators. Given the mechanical force necessary to drive a rotor, though, I could build an alternator, even calibrate it to what the power grid used to provide, which was... I think fifty Hertz here. Finding a ring to act as the stator might be a challenge, but if all else fails I...
快速擦洗并换上干净 T 恤后，我漫步返回营地，将湿衣物搭在晾衣绳上。今天我需要准备些什么呢？即便有能力，我也不打算组装整台内燃机，这部分至少得靠搜寻。难点在于，多数内燃机都装在汽车或发电机里。考虑到驱动转子所需的机械力，我或许能自制一个交流发电机，并校准至电网原先提供的频率，这里应该是五十赫兹。寻找作为定子的环可能颇具挑战，但若实在找不到，我...

"Hey, Asuka?" 嘿，阿苏卡？

I twitch, gazing over at Shinji, who's just sitting in place with a shirt in one hand. "Yeah?"
我身体一颤，目光投向静坐不动、手里拿着衬衫的 Shinji。“怎么了？”

He makes an uncomfortable face. "I know we didn't find any useful generators last time we went looking, but there have to be some lying around. I mean, they used to sell them at... like, home-improvement type stores, didn't they?"
他面露难色，说道：“上次我们寻找时确实没找到有用的发电机，但总该有些散落在外。毕竟，以前不是在家装店这类地方都有售吗？”

"Probably," I shrug. I don't know that anything we could get there would be strong enough to work at desalination, but we could probably use it for ourselves, or for something else. "Yeah, I guess we can check that out before I make you start winding coils of copper wire."
或许吧，" 我耸了耸肩。我不确定我们能在那里找到的设备是否足以用于海水淡化，但至少可以考虑用来满足我们的其他需求。"嗯，我想我们可以先去探查一下，然后再让你开始绕制铜线圈。

He smiles, an uncertain expression. "That's, um... thanks?"
他带着几分不确定的微笑，说道：“呃，谢谢？”

"No problem. Go clean up, jerk."
没问题。去收拾一下，混蛋。

"Fine." Shaking his head, he grabs his own stuff, then heads over to the makeshift path we've been using to get to the little clearing.
"行。"他摇摇头，拿起自己的物品，随即走向我们常走的那条通往小空地的临时路径。

When he gets back a little bit later, I've already started in on breakfast in the form of stale dry cereal. It's funny how you can get used to eating just about anything. He shortly joins me, digging a fistful out for himself to munch on.
他稍后回来时，我已开始吃早餐，那是一碗干硬的旧麦片。人真是能适应各种食物。他不久也加入进来，抓起一把麦片开始吃。

Shortly I elbow him. "Let's go."
我很快用胳膊肘轻推了他一下，说："走吧。"

Nodding, he closes the cereal box back up. "Let me get my hat."
他点头示意，将麦片盒重新封好，说道：“我去拿帽子。”

I stand up, then wait a moment for him to get ready. On our way through the trees to the highway, I give his shoulder an absent backhanded smack. "Suppose the truck still has enough gas to get us around?"
我起身，稍等片刻让他准备。穿行于林间前往公路时，我随意地用手背轻拍了一下他的肩膀。“你看卡车里的油还够我们转悠吗？”

"No idea," he admits with a sigh. "I wasn't paying attention to the gauge last time."
真没辙，" 他叹息着承认，"上次我压根没留意仪表。

"Great." He just shrugs, and we walk the rest of the way without conversation.
"挺好的。"他只是耸耸肩，随后我们一路沉默地走完了剩下的路。

As it turns out there is gas in the Humvee, but not very much, probably not enough to get us down the hill, let alone back up it. Thus I spend a few moments watching Shinji trying and failing to get it back into its original place before finally giving up and leaving the thing wedged out an an angle from where it belongs. We have to head some distance down the hill before finding another vehicle that'll actually start, and once again I make him drive it down towards the city.
原来悍马车里还有汽油，但存量不多，估计连下山都成问题，更不用说再开回山上。我目睹真嗣尝试将车复位却未能成功，最后只得放弃，让车子斜斜地卡在不该在的位置。我们不得不走下山坡一段距离，才找到一辆能启动的车，我再次让他驾驶着向城市进发。

"Do you know where we're going?" he asks at one point.
"你知道我们这是要去哪儿吗？"他某一刻这样问道。

"No." Searching again was his idea; why is he asking me? "Just drive."
不。"再次搜索是他提出的，怎么还来问我？"继续开吧。

"Okay." 好的。

An hour later, by my guess, he finally rolls into the parking lot of a sprawling, warehouse-like store on the western side of the city. As he pulls the key from the ignition and the engine starts ticking to coolness, he gives me a thoughtful sideways glance. "Got our keys?"
大约一小时后，他终于开进了位于城市西边的一家大型仓库式商店的停车场。随着他从点火器中抽出钥匙，引擎开始冷却发出滴答声，他若有所思地向我投来一瞥。“钥匙拿到了吗？”

It takes me a moment to realize he's talking about the baseball bat. "Check," I confirm, patting where it's wedged between my seat and the door.
我愣了一下才反应过来，他说的原来是那根棒球棒。“确认无误，”我边说边拍了拍座椅与车门间夹着它的地方。

He nods. "Flashlights?" 他点头问道：“手电筒吗？”

"In the back." 在背后。

Together we hop to the ground, not even bothering to take the keys out of the truck. I pause long enough to grab our flashlights, then toss one to Shinji. The bat, I keep; since he got to drive, I get to open the place up. I do so with a loud growl, taking five swings to make sure there aren't any wedges of glass still resident in the door frames; I've learned to be wary of that before.
我们一同跳到地面，连卡车钥匙都懒得拔。我稍作停留，抓起手电筒，扔给真嗣一支。球棒我则留下；既然他负责驾驶，开门的工作就交给我了。我用力猛击五次，确保门框内没有残留的玻璃碎片；我早已学会对此保持警惕。

"Nice," nods Shinji. "You must like smashing stuff."
不错，" Shinji 点头道，"你肯定喜欢搞破坏。

I give him a smile, then heft the bat to my shoulder. "You could say that. Let's go."
我向他微微一笑，随即把球棒扛上肩头。“这么说也行。走吧。”

With flashlights at the ready we strike into the store, quickly splitting up to search on account of it being not at all clear which section would hold something like portable generators. Most of the stuff in here seems totally useless now, like sheets of drywall, high-gloss indoor paint and decorative outlet covers. I keep a running mental catalogue, though, of stuff I might be able to pillage for tubes, pumps, heaters, filters or anything else that might help me turn salty LCL into drinkable water.
我们手持手电筒冲进商店，迅速分散搜寻，因为不清楚哪个区域藏有便携式发电机。店内多数物品如今已无用武之地，如石膏板、高光室内漆和装饰插座盖。然而，我心中不断更新着可能搜刮的物品清单，包括管道、泵、加热器、过滤器等，这些或许能助我将含盐的淋巴液转化为饮用水。

Maybe fifteen minutes later, I find the generators, wedged into one of the back corners. "Hey, idiot! I found them!"
大约十五分钟后，我在后方的角落里发现了发电机。“喂，笨蛋！我找到了！”

Shortly the beam of his flashlight angles into view, followed momentarily by Shinji himself. "Ah, cool. What the hell is that, though? You found a chainsaw?"
不久，他的手电筒光束斜射入视野，随后真嗣本人也短暂出现。"啊，真酷。可那究竟是什么？你找到了链锯吗？"

I grin at the thing in my left hand. "Yeah. I thought it might come in handy since we're surrounded by burnable trees up there."
我对着左手里的东西笑了笑。“嗯，考虑到我们周围都是易燃的树木，我觉得这东西可能会很有用。”

He smiles awkwardly at this, reaching to scratch the back of his head. "Do we need it? I don't want to be dependent on having to run down here for fuel, and I don't really mind using the axe."
他尴尬地笑了笑，伸手挠了挠后脑勺。“我们非得用这个吗？我不想总得跑下来加油，用斧头我也挺习惯的。”

I ponder that briefly. It sounds like he's volunteering to do most of the wood-chopping, which would in turn make him smell like sap, which I like. "Okay." Letting the chainsaw crash to the ground, I forget about it and wander closer to the generators, brightly-colored boxy things full of metal and plastic and outlets.
我略加思索，感觉他好像主动提出要劈大部分的柴，这样他身上就会沾染上我喜欢的树液味。"行。" 我让链锯随意落地，不再管它，径直走向那些色彩斑斓、方正的发电机，它们装满了金属、塑料和插座。

"What kind do we need?" wonders Shinji, shuffling closer to me. "I didn't realize they came in so many varieties."
我们究竟需要哪一种呢？" 新二说着，向我这边挪了挪，"真没想到居然有这么多种类。

"The difference is mostly just the wattage of the output," I explain absently, studying what I can read of the signs in front of me. "Here, this one can produce fifteen thousand watts. That'll boil a liter of water in... less than thirty seconds, I think." I won't get close to that kind of efficiency, but that's not too bad. Better than I was expecting. "And it runs ten hours on a full tank." Okay, that's not very good, but there's not much I can do about that.
"区别主要在于输出功率，"我心不在焉地解释着，同时仔细观察眼前的标识。"瞧，这台能输出一万五千瓦，估计不到三十秒就能烧开一升水。"虽然我达不到那种效率，但也不算太差，比我预想的要好。"而且它满箱能运行十小时。"嗯，这续航不太理想，但我也没什么办法。

"Asuka?" His voice is flat. "It weighs over two hundred kilos."
飞鸟？" 他的语气毫无起伏。"这东西超过两百公斤重。

I shrug. "So? It's got wheels."
我耸了耸肩。“那又如何？反正它有轮子。”

"Yeah, but there's broken glass all over the floor near the door. And I doubt we can lift it into the truck."
确实，门边地上满是碎玻璃。我怀疑我们能否将其搬上卡车。

I frown at this. He's probably right; the thing is about twice as heavy as the two of us combined, I'd bet. "Wait here," I instruct, then turn my back and jog out of the aisle.
我对此皱眉，他或许说得没错；那东西的重量恐怕是我们两人总和的两倍。“你在这儿等一下，”我嘱咐完，便转身快步离开了过道。

Shortly I find a sturdy-looking metal shelf in one of the displays, currently being used to hold up vacuum cleaners. A few swings of the bat clears it off, and then it occurs to me I don't have a socket set to free it from the frame. Sighing, I roam back to the hardware section and find one, then discover Shinji is frowning at my vandalized display when I return.
很快，我在一个展示区找到一个坚固的金属货架，上面正摆放着吸尘器。几棒下去，货架上的物品被清理一空，但我随即发现没有套筒扳手无法将其从框架上拆卸。无奈地叹了口气，我返回五金区取来工具，回来时却见真嗣正皱眉看着被我破坏的展示架。

"Want to be helpful?" I prompt, rooting through the sockets to find one that fits the nuts. "Get another of these and start unscrewing."
想搭把手吗？"我一边提议，一边在插座堆里寻找匹配螺母的插头。"再拿一个这样的，开始拧开吧。

He shifts his feet. "I don't... really know how."
他挪动了一下脚，说：“我真不太...知道怎么做。”

"It's not like I'm an expert either," I counter curtly. "Just get one. I'll show you how they work."
我也不是什么专家，"我直截了当地反驳，"拿一个来，我演示给你看怎么用。

"Okay." He trots away, into the darkness.
"好的。"他小跑着消失在黑暗里。

When he gets back I offer a brief tutorial, but even so it takes us longer than I'd hoped to get the damn shelf down. The two of us then carry it through the store, holding flashlights awkwardly, before letting it clatter loudly the the ground in front of the door. After backtracking all the way back to the generator, we make the same trip again with both of us pushing the thing forward. A little bit of grunting gets it onto the shelf, allowing us to push it onto the pavement outside.
他回来后，我简要指导了一下，但拆下那个架子还是比预想的费时。我们俩笨拙地拿着手电筒，抬着架子穿过店内，最后在门口让它重重地摔在地上。折返至发电机处后，我们再次推着架子走了一遍。经过一番努力，终于将架子推上了路面。

"I hope you only want one of these," mutters Shinji as he catches his breath. Blue eyes regard both generator and the Humvee with mixed doubt and dread.
"希望你只挑一个，"真嗣喘息着喃喃自语。他那双蓝眼睛里混杂着疑虑与不安，来回打量着发电机和悍马车。

"For now," I nod. "You should be glad I'm helping you bulk up. Don't you want to impress the ladies?" I give his triceps a few squeezes as I speak.
"眼下，" 我点头表示，"你得感激我帮你练壮实。难道你不想在女士们面前显摆显摆？" 说话间，我轻轻捏了几下他的三头肌。

"Ladies? You mean just you?" He shakes his head wearily. "If I need muscles to get you, I'm screwed."
女士们？你是指只有你一个人吗？"他疲惫地摇了摇头。"如果非得靠蛮力才能得到你，那我可就麻烦了。

I laugh at this, then decide he's rested enough and start dragging the shelf towards the truck. As I do so, he opts to be a good sport and open the back of the vehicle up, and in an instant our shelf is now also a ramp.
我对此不禁笑了出来，觉得他已经休息得差不多了，便开始拖动货架向卡车靠近。他见状，便主动帮忙，打开了车后的门，一瞬间，我们的货架就变成了一个斜坡。

"You ready?" I ask brightly, shaking my arms out as I wander back over to the generator. "This is probably going to suck."
准备好了吗？"我兴奋地问，同时活动着双臂，悠闲地走回发电机旁。"估计这感觉不会太好。

"Yeah. Let's just get it over with."
对，咱们快点把它搞定吧。

Nodding, I wait until he's in place, and then we wrestle the thing down the curb and over towards the base of our ramp. "Hey," I grunt on the way, "that thing's not wide enough for us both. You want to push or pull?"
我点头示意，待他站好位置后，我们合力将那物件从路边拖至斜坡基部。"喂，"我边使劲边说，"这东西不够宽，容不下咱俩。你想推还是拉？"

"I'll push," he volunteers. He'd probably rather be under the generator in case it falls.
"我来推，"他主动说道。他可能更希望待在发电机下方，以防万一它倒下来。

I shake my head, too winded to argue. "Fine. Let me get around front." As we reach the base, I hop up onto the ramp and grab the frame of the generator. Fortunately there are handholds all over it, probably for situations like this. Once my feet are solidly planted, I meet Shinji's gaze and nod. "Ready."
我摇摇头，气喘吁吁，无力争辩。"行吧。我绕到前面去。"抵达底部后，我跃上斜坡，紧抓发电机框架。幸好，上面遍布抓手，想必正是为此类情况设计。双脚站稳后，我与真嗣对视，点头示意。"准备就绪。"

He growls and shoulders into the thing, and I grit my teeth trying to pull it up towards me. A moment later it heaves upward, having made the transition from the parking lot to the ramp, and we continue to inch it on up. The shelf bows noticeably under the weight, but I try to ignore it, just as I try to ignore how my sweaty hands want to slip on the smooth steel handles.
他低吼着用肩膀顶住那物，我咬紧牙关，竭力将其向我这边拉。不一会儿，它猛地向上抬起，从停车场移至斜坡，我们继续一点一点地推它向上。货架因重压而明显弯曲，但我尽量不去理会，正如我尽量不去理会我那汗湿的手在光滑的钢把手上打滑一样。

"Hurry," he rasps. "I'm not... just..."
快点，" 他喘着气说。"我并不是...仅仅...

"I'm hurrying," I growl. "我急着呢," 我低吼一声。

His breathing grows more ragged and shortly he begins to yell wordlessly, and it takes me a moment to realize I'm doing the same. Somehow we manage to get the generator up, though, and I collapse against the inside wall of the truck with a sigh and a grimace. My arms are shaking, and my fingers are white from the pressure. I'll bet my back and forearms start killing me later tonight.
他的呼吸越发急促，很快便开始无言地大喊，我愣了一下才发觉自己也在跟着喊。尽管如此，我们还是设法让发电机运转起来，我随即瘫坐在卡车内壁旁，叹息中带着苦笑。双臂颤抖不已，手指因用力过度而显得苍白。我敢肯定，今晚我的背和前臂会痛得要命。

Shinji's just sort of sprawled on the ramp now, breathing heavily. "You know what?" he wheezes, lifting his face from the floor of the truck. "The shelf won't fit in here."
真嗣此刻正瘫坐在斜坡上，喘着粗气。“知道吗？”他气喘吁吁地说，从卡车底板上抬起头。“架子装不进这里。”

I blink at him for a moment, then at the ramp. "Fuck. We'll just tie it on top or something."
我朝他眨眼示意，接着望向斜坡，脱口而出：“糟糕。看来只能绑在车顶上了。”

"Sure. Let's keep moving, though, otherwise I'm going to fall asleep."
当然。我们还是继续走吧，否则我快睡着了。

"Yeah." I hop down, and together we shuffle back into the store. "There's some random other stuff I want to get, if you want to find some more rope or something."
好的。"我跳下地面，我们一同慢步返回店内。"我还想顺便买点别的杂货，你要是想再找些绳子之类的也可以。

He exhales heavily, working his shoulder. "Sounds good."
他深吸一口气，活动了一下肩膀，说：“听起来挺好的。”

I nod, and we part ways again. I was excited about this before; now I just want to get it done.
我点头示意，我们再次各自离去。之前我对这件事满怀期待；如今，我只想尽快了结。

In maybe half an hour I find my way back outside with a shopping cart full of junk. Shinji, I notice with pleasure, has already tied the shelf to the top of the SAM system, and is now just lounging in the back of the truck. He nods once on my arrival.
大约半小时后，我推着装满杂物的购物车回到户外。高兴地看到，Shinji 已经把货架固定在 SAM 系统顶上，现在正悠哉地躺在卡车后厢。他看到我时，向我点了一下头。

"Let me get this inside," I suggest, "and then we can get out of here." Wheeling the cart over near him, I start throwing packages inside.
我建议说：‘先把这些东西搬进去吧，之后我们就能离开这儿了。’我推着购物车靠近他，开始将包裹逐一放入。

"It got cloudy on us," he observes, watching me.
他注视着我，说道：'天突然阴了下来。'

"So it did." One by one boxes and bags start flying into the truck, most landing near him.
确实如此。箱子和袋子接连不断地飞入卡车，多数都落在了他附近。

"I like sleeping under the stars," he continues, "but I'm tired of getting rained on at night, so I want to get a tarp or something to hang over me when I sleep. But I'm too nervous it'll fall on me and smother me or something."
我喜欢在星空下露宿，"他接着说，"但夜里总被雨淋让我厌烦，因此我想弄块防水布之类的东西，睡觉时挂起来遮雨。但又担心它万一掉下来，会把我闷住或出什么意外。

I snort. "So let's just get a tent, genius."
我嗤笑道：“那就租个帐篷吧，真是天才。”

I toss a few more boxes in before realizing he still hasn't said anything. An upward glance shows him just sitting there, staring back at me with a peculiar expression, a surprised one.
我又往里扔了几个箱子，这才注意到他一直没吭声。抬头一看，只见他坐在那里，用一种颇为惊讶的表情回望着我。

As soon as I see him, though, he nods, clearing his face back to normal. "Sure. That would... make more sense, probably."
我一见到他，他便点头，表情恢复如常。“当然。这样或许……更合理。”

I lift my eyebrows at the last box, a microwave oven, and wedge it in next to the other stuff, but I don't respond. What's so weird about a tent? Yeah, we'd be sleeping under the same roof, but does that surprise him so much? Maybe he just didn't want to be the one to suggest it first. Probably thought I'd call him a perv or something. And I would have. But I would've agreed.
我对着最后一个箱子——微波炉挑了挑眉，将其挤进其他物品旁边，却未作声。帐篷有什么好奇怪的？虽说我们会在同一个屋檐下过夜，但这有什么让他大惊小怪的？或许他只是不愿先开口提议。大概以为我会骂他变态之类的。虽然我可能会那么说，但我还是会同意的。

"Did you see any inside?" he wonders as I'm giving the shopping cart a farewell shove. "I didn't."
你看到里面有什么了吗？" 他好奇地问，我则轻轻推了一下购物车，准备离开。"我没注意到。

"Nope. Get in the front; we'll find one."
不行，坐前排吧；我们能找到一个位置的。

As soon as we're both buckled in, he shifts into gear and pulls out. "I actually know an outdoors store," he admits, giving me a quick smile before returning his gaze to the road. "I was there before."
我们一系好安全带，他便挂挡驶出。“其实我知道一家户外用品店，”他坦言，对我快速一笑后，目光又转向了道路。“我之前去过。”

"Good." Shifting in my seat, I lean back and try to doze.
"好的。" 我调整了一下坐姿，向后倚靠，试图打个盹。

I don't get a chance to, though; it seems Shinji's store was only a few blocks away. Stifling a groan, I slip out of the truck again and together we head inside.
然而，我并没有机会；真嗣的店似乎只隔了几条街。我忍住叹息，再次从卡车上下来，我们一同走了进去。

It doesn't take us long to find a good tent. After brief discussion we opt for just a two-person one, rather than anything larger; there isn't that much space at the site, and we need some left over for fires and so on.
我们迅速选定了一个合适的帐篷。经过简短商议，决定采用双人帐篷，避免占用过多空间；毕竟营地面积不大，还需预留位置用于生火等活动。

On the way back up the hill I finally get a catnap in. Shinji doesn't try to wake me.
返回山上的路上，我总算能打个盹。真嗣并没有打扰我。

The feel of tires on rough gravel wakes me with a start, and I gaze out the window at the trees near our spot. Then, nodding, I stretch in the seat. "Tell you what," I offer. "If we can get the tent up, I won't bother with the generator again today. You can get back to your manga or whatever."
轮胎碾过粗糙碎石的震动猛然将我唤醒，我透过车窗凝视着附近的树木。随后，我点了点头，在座位上舒展了一下身体。“这样吧，”我提议道，“要是我们能搭好帐篷，我今天就不再弄发电机了。你可以继续看你的漫画或者做别的。”

He exhales happily at this. "Okay. That's great."
他对此满意地舒了一口气，说道：“好的，太好了。”

Once he stops we hop out and waste little time unpacking the tent. There are instructions printed in nine languages, of which I speak three and Shinji speaks maybe one and a quarter, but the thing seems easy enough to set up without any directions at all. In less than twenty minutes we're moving our sleeping supplies inside. Shinji's blankets sprawl somewhat, pushing my sleeping bag off to one side, and it smells vaguely of nylon inside still, but I don't care. I can watch him sleep from much nearer in here.
他一停下，我们立刻跳出车外，迅速搭起帐篷。帐篷说明书上印着九种语言，我懂其中三种，Shinji 大概能看懂一种多一点，但这帐篷搭建起来似乎简单到无需任何指导。不出二十分钟，我们已将睡具搬入帐篷。Shinji 的毯子铺得有些凌乱，把我的睡袋挤到了一边，帐篷内还残留着尼龙的气味，但我并不在意。在这里，我能更近地凝视他安睡。

With that done, I find the manga I was reading, and Shinji does the same, so we read sprawled out next to the log-bench by the empty firepit. It's early afternoon, only, so that gives me a few hours to giggle over my manga before we eat. I'd like to play some more cards, but that can wait until tonight. It'll be better around the fire anyway.
处理完这些后，我找到了正在看的漫画，真嗣也如法炮制，我们便在空火坑旁的圆木长凳边舒展身体阅读。此时正值午后，我有几个小时可以边看漫画边偷笑，之后再享用晚餐。我还想继续玩牌，不过可以留到晚上。围着篝火玩牌，气氛会更佳。

When Shinji finally starts cooking I just continue to read, but it doesn't take long, so shortly we're feasting on noodles with cilantro and curry. I actually used to like curry before living with Misato, but now it just makes me think of her when I eat it. I guess it's not too bad, and for meals these days there's precious little to choose from; I should be glad I have Shinji to cook for me, because otherwise I'd probably be eating junk food half the time.
真嗣开始做饭时，我继续看书，没多久我们就吃上了香菜咖喱面。我以前挺喜欢咖喱的，但和美里一起生活后，每次吃咖喱都会想起她。虽然不算太糟，但如今餐食选择有限，我得庆幸有真嗣做饭，不然我可能一半时间都在吃垃圾食品。

Afterwards, I work on cleaning up while Shinji puts together a fire. "Wanna play cards again?" I offer, glancing over at him as I scrub the pot. "Or something?"
随后，我忙着清洗餐具，真嗣则负责生火。"还想玩牌吗？"我一边擦洗着锅，一边向他提议，"还是做点别的？"

"Sure." Though his back is to me, I can hear the pleasure in his voice. "That was fun, last night."
当然。"虽然他背对着我，但我能听出他声音里的愉悦。"昨晚玩得真开心。

I feel myself grinning. "Yeah. After this I'll pull my sleeping bag out for us."
我不禁露出了笑容。“对啊。待会儿我就把咱们的睡袋拿出来。”

"Okay." 好的。

Silence falls between us, and soon I can smell wood smoke from the fire he's nurturing. In moments I set the pot aside to dry, then hurry into the tent and emerge with my sleeping bag in tow. Shinji, I note with a slight smile, has already gotten the cards out.
我们之间陷入了沉默，不久我便嗅到了他照料的篝火飘来的木烟味。我随即把锅子搁在一旁晾干，匆匆进入帐篷取出睡袋。注意到真嗣已经摆出了纸牌，我不禁微微一笑。

Moving quickly, I kick my shoes off and drop to the bag while he does the same. I grab the cards first, then shuffle them briefly and start dealing.
我迅速脱掉鞋子，扑向袋子，他也如法炮制。我首先抓起卡片，稍作洗牌后便开始发牌。

When it becomes apparent what I'm dealing, Shinji chuckles. "With all the stuff we could be playing, it's war again?"
当真嗣明白我面对的是什么时，他不禁笑出声来。“我们本有那么多游戏可玩，怎么又是战争？”

I lift an eyebrow at this. "All the stuff we could be playing? Just because we're sleeping in the same tent doesn't mean I'm a perv now."
我对此挑了挑眉，反问道：“我们能玩的东西那么多，难道就因为睡同一个帐篷，我就成了变态？”

He regards me for a long moment with narrowed eyes, and belatedly I start to wonder if maybe I'm overplaying my hand on the flirting. Eventually, though, he just shrugs mildly. "I guess we'll see."
他眯着眼睛凝视我良久，我这才迟钝地意识到，或许我在调情上有些过头了。然而，他最后只是轻描淡写地耸了耸肩，“走着瞧吧。”

Even though this is a pretty lame response on his part, I elect to leave it alone and instead just finish dealing out the deck. "Since I'm feeling nice," I decide afterwards, "I won't even count cards this time." It'll be hard to stop, but if I try not to think about it, maybe I can.
虽然他的回答挺没劲的，我还是决定不追究，继续发牌。"看在我今天心情好的份上，"我接着想，"这次就不算牌了。"虽然很难忍住不算，但只要不去想，或许我能做到。

He shrugs again, neatening his pile. "You may as well. It makes the game go faster."
他又耸了耸肩，整理了一下自己的牌。“你不妨也这么做，这样游戏进展会更快。”

That's not necessarily true, but I smile anyway. "Well, then, we'll play something else after this. If you're good you might even get your chance to play strip poker." God damn it. I'm doing it again.
虽然那未必是真的，但我还是忍不住笑了。"行吧，这局过后我们换别的玩。要是你表现不错，或许真能让你试试脱衣扑克。"真是的，我又说漏嘴了。

"You keep bringing that up," murmurs Shinji as we flip over the first pair of cards. "If it would really make you feel better, you could just play war naked."
你总提这事，" 真嗣在我们翻开第一对牌时轻声说，"要是真能让你舒心，你完全可以光着身子玩战争游戏。

I giggle, a little surprised he would say that. Though I suppose he might just be getting tired of all the teasing. "I was just going to suggest blackjack or something," I admit, "but there's not much to bet with, and it's boring without the betting."
我忍不住笑出声，对他这么说感到有些意外。或许他只是对这些玩笑感到厌烦了。“我原本打算提议玩玩二十一点之类的，”我坦言，“但没什么可下注的，没有赌注玩起来挺没劲的。”

"That's fine," he concedes. "I'm pretty bad at it anyway."
没关系，" 他承认说，"我本来就不太擅长这个。

I open my mouth to note that this is all the more reason for me to suggest playing it, but a sharp crack sounds from the fire before I can speak. Jerking my head around, I watch the logs shift slightly, while sparks swirl angrily skyward.
我正要开口强调这正是我提议玩它的理由，火堆却突然发出一声脆响，打断了我的话。我急忙转头，只见木柴轻轻挪动，火星如怒般向空中四溅。

Something draws my eyes to the side, where the tent sits. It seems... a little close to the fire, maybe. "Do you think--?"
有什么东西吸引我侧目，只见帐篷坐落一旁。它似乎...离火源有些近了。"你觉得——？"

"Hey, is the--?" he asks at the same time.
"嘿，是不是——？" 他同时问道。

When he just trails off, I roll my eyes. "Yeah, it might be too close."
他一含糊其辞，我就忍不住翻白眼。“嗯，确实可能太近了。”

"We'll keep an eye on it tonight, then," he decides, "and move it tomorrow. Another meter away should probably be good."
今晚我们会留意一下，明天再挪动它。再挪远一米应该就合适了。

I would almost prefer moving it tonight, but for some reason I don't really want to disagree with him over something so trivial. "Fine. Just keep watching it; you're facing it more than I am."
我差点就想提议今晚搬动它，但出于某种原因，我不想因为这点小事与他产生分歧。"行吧。你就继续盯着它吧；你比我更常面对它。"

"I can do that," he assures, pausing to collect a trick. The ten goes on top, I see, and the four below.
"我能够做到，"他肯定地说，稍作停顿以施展一个技巧。十点置于上方，我注意到，而四点则置于其下。

A few more rounds of the game elapse in silence. "You know," I muse, "now that we have a generator, we could get a tv and some video games or something."
游戏在沉默中又进行了几轮。“你知道的，”我若有所思地说，“既然有了发电机，我们不妨弄台电视，再添置些电子游戏什么的。”

Shinji smiles uncomfortably, blue eyes thoughtful in the firelight. "I'm not sure we should."
真嗣尴尬地微笑着，蓝色的眼睛在火光映照下显得深思熟虑。“我不确定我们是否该这么做。”

"What? Why not?" 为什么不行呢？

He shrugs, fidgeting with his cards. "I don't think we should get used to having that kind of stuff," he explains. "We might never have it again, except with a generator."
他耸耸肩，摆弄着手里的牌，解释说：“我们不该习惯拥有那样的东西，可能以后除了用发电机，就再也得不到了。”

"Oh, come on," I mutter. "I know there's no one else around yet, but eventually some people will show up, right? I'd be surprised if humanity was collectively so weak that everyone but maybe a couple dozen people stayed up in orbit."
哎，别这样，"我低声自语，"现在虽然周围还没人，但迟早会有人来的，不是吗？如果人类真的这么不堪一击，除了少数几十人外，其他人都留在太空，那我可真要大跌眼镜了。

"We need more than that, though," he counters, his tone insistent. "What if just half of all people come back? That's... what, maybe two billion people, in the whole world? Is that enough to keep industry and everything running?"
但我们需要的远不止这些，"他坚持道，语气迫切。"假设只有全球一半的人口回归，那大约是二十亿人。这样的规模，真的足以支撑工业和整个社会的运转吗？

I pause, frowning at him, surprised at the depth of the question, surprised he's given it that much thought. "I'm... not sure," I admit.
我顿了顿，眉头微蹙地望着他，对这问题的深度感到惊讶，没想到他竟思考得这么深。“我……还真不确定，”我坦白说。

He smiles. "I'm not either. I just thought we should keep it in mind, and not take things for granted."
他微笑道：“我同样不这么认为。只是觉得我们应当铭记在心，不可对事物掉以轻心。”

I nod slowly, collecting a trick and putting it in my victory pile. That's surprisingly... wise. Maybe I should pay more attention to his objections to stuff. "What...?" I swallow. "What do you think the future will be like?"
我缓缓点头，将一个技巧收入我的胜利堆，这举动意外地显得颇为明智。看来我得更加留意他对事物的异议了。“什么……？”我顿了顿，问道，“你觉得未来会是怎样的？”

"Me?" He seems surprised I would ask him. "I have no idea. I guess I'd be happy if everything went more or less back to normal. If Misato comes back, I wouldn't mind living with her again. If she'd let me."
我？" 他显得有些意外我会问他。"说实话，我也没什么头绪。大概能回到以前那种生活就挺好的。要是 Misato 回来了，再和她同住我也乐意，只要她愿意。

I'm sure she would. "True," I acknowledge. "I might too, if she'd let me. You kept things interesting around there."
我敢肯定她会这么做。"没错，"我点头认同，"如果她同意，我或许也会加入。你确实让那里充满了趣味。"

He chuckles. "No, I think that was mostly you."
他笑着说：“不，我看那多半是你。”

I smile at the cards. "Well, maybe."
我对着牌微笑道：“嗯，或许吧。”

He laughs again, quietly, and for a time the game continues in silence. He's actually beating me pretty badly this time; I haven't been paying enough attention to stack the deck in my favor, and the luck of the deal wasn't with me.
他再次轻声笑了，游戏在沉默中继续进行。这次他确实把我打得落花流水；我未能充分留意去操控牌局以利于己，发牌的运气也未曾眷顾我。

When I have just six cards left, I toss my head. "Let's just call this one, Shinji. You're probably going to win."
手里只剩六张牌时，我摇了摇头。“这局算你赢了，真嗣。你多半会胜出。”

He grins at me, almost smugly. "You just don't want to lose, do you? Rather jump ship and start playing a game you can win?"
他冲我得意地笑了笑，说：“你只是不想输吧？宁愿换条船，玩一个你能赢的游戏？”

"Of course." Who wouldn't?
当然。谁会不呢？

"Oh, fine," he mutters, pushing all of our cards into one big pile, which he begins to neaten for shuffling. "What, then? Go fish?"
哦，行吧，"他低声说着，把我们的牌堆成一大摞，开始整理准备洗牌。"那接下来呢？要玩'抽对儿'吗？

I scoff at that. "Shinji... we're not, like... eight years old, are we?"
我对此嗤之以鼻。"真嗣...我们总不会还是八岁小孩吧？"

He lifts a cool eyebrow at me. "You'll happily play war, but you're too good for go fish?"
他对我挑起一边眉毛，带着一丝冷静。“你愿意玩打仗游戏，却觉得玩钓鱼牌配不上你？”

"Yeah, you know what? Bite me."
对，你知道吗？随你便吧。

"I don't know many other games, though," he sighs. "How about hearts?"
我对其他游戏了解不多，"他叹了口气，"玩心心如何？

I smile. "You can't play hearts with two people."
我笑着说：“红心游戏得三个人以上才能玩。”

"Oh, yeah." 哦，对。

"You know, if we'd gotten a chessboard, this wouldn't be a problem." I shake my head. "Do you know how to play cribbage?"
你看，要是我们手头有副棋盘，这问题就迎刃而解了。" 我摇摇头。"你会打克里比奇牌吗？

He brightens at this, then hesitates. "Yeah, but... Asuka, we don't have a board."
他听到这话眼前一亮，但很快又犹豫了。“嗯，可是……明日香，我们没有棋盘啊。”

I grin, tapping my head. "I'll keep track of the score."
我笑着敲敲脑袋，说：“我会记住比分的。”

The sudden doubt painting his face makes me want to punch him. "It's, uh... not that I don't trust you, but..."
他脸上突如其来的疑云让我忍不住想给他一拳。“呃，不是我不相信你，只是……”

"Shinji, I'm confident I can beat you without resorting to lying about the score." What a dork. "And if not, you can just keep track for yourself on that little notebook you have."
Shinji，我确信不靠谎报比分也能胜过你。你真是个书呆子。如果做不到，你大可以自己在那本小笔记本上做记录。

He waves dismissively, then settles in and starts dealing, six cards to each of us. "I used to beat Toji and Kensuke at this, you know," he warns. "I'm actually good at it."
他轻蔑地挥手示意，随后坐稳开始发牌，每人六张。“我以前常赢东治和健介，你可知道，”他提醒道，“我在这方面其实挺在行的。”

"Yeah?" When he's done dealing I retrieve my hand and quickly sort it. It's decent, no better. "Comparing yourself to those two? Is that really a reliable metric?"
真的吗？他处理完毕后，我拿起自己的牌快速整理了一下。牌面还算过得去，但并不出色。“把自己和那两位比较？这样的标准真的可靠吗？”

"I guess we'll find out, won't we?"
我想我们终究会知道的，对吧？

Snorting, I choose a couple of cards and toss them face-down into his crib. When he does the same, I split the deck and wait for him to flip the up-card, then grin; it almost doubles the value of my hand. "You're about to get crushed, I'm afraid," I sigh, tossing out a card to start the pegging. "Four."
我轻哼一声，选了几张牌，面朝下抛入他的牌堆。他如法炮制后，我便将牌堆分开，静待他翻开顶牌，随即露出得意的笑容；此举几乎使我的手牌价值倍增。“看来你难逃一劫了，”我叹息着，打出一张牌启动计分。“四点。”

He quirks a grin. "Eight, for two."
他咧嘴一笑，“八个，给两个人。”

What a dick. "Um, seventeen."
真是粗鲁。“呃，十七。”

Play proceeds in the usual fashion and, to my surprise, I find that he's very good at pegging despite my advantage in the actual counting. As such he ends up beating me one-twenty-one to one-seventeen.
比赛如常进行，出乎意料的是，尽管我在计数上占优，他却极擅长得分。最终他以 121 比 117 战胜了我。

After the game he leans back triumphantly, folding hands behind his head. "College graduate, are you?" he wonders lightly. "Genius? Prodigy and all that?"
比赛结束后，他得意洋洋地靠在椅背上，双手交叉枕在脑后。“你是大学毕业的？”他漫不经心地问道，“天才？神童什么的？”

"Oh, fuck off." I fire a glare at him while I collect the cards back into the deck.
"哦，走开。" 我瞪了他一眼，同时将牌重新收拢成一副。

"Sorry." His smile grows less smug and more apologetic. "Another game?"
抱歉。" 他的笑容中少了些自得，多了些歉疚。"再玩一局如何？

I consider that, then sigh. "Shinji, the whole top half of my body is sore. I kind of just want to go to bed."
我这么想着，不禁叹了口气。“真嗣，我上半身疼得厉害，真想直接去睡了。”

"That's... that's fine." His eyes dart to the tent, as though he just remembered we'll be sharing it.
"那...那倒没事。" 他眼神一转，瞥向帐篷，似乎才记起我们要同住一顶。

I nod. "I can douse the fire if you want to brush your teeth and everything."
我点头道：“如果你想刷牙什么的，我可以把火灭掉。”

"Sure." 当然。

As he finds his bathroom things, I grab a few bottles of water and start upending them over the crackling fire. It hisses angrily, sending sooty steam roiling up past me before it dissipates, but I keep pouring. When the first bottle is gone, I kick the logs around somewhat before starting on the second.
他正忙着找洗漱用品，我则拿起几瓶水，往噼啪燃烧的火堆上浇。水一接触到火，便发出愤怒的嘶嘶声，腾起一股股黑烟，在我面前渐渐散去，但我仍继续倒水。倒完第一瓶后，我稍稍拨动了一下木柴，接着倒第二瓶。

Shortly the fire is nothing but a few spots of glowing orange amid a wet knot of black and grey wood. Nodding to myself, I toss the bottles into our waste bin, then cross to the flaps of the tent and pause there. Shinji's already inside; his shoes are sitting outside and I can hear him rustling around in there, getting comfortable.
很快，火光仅剩几处橙色亮点，四周是湿透的黑灰木块。我满意地点点头，将瓶子投入垃圾桶，随后走向帐篷入口，驻足片刻。真嗣已入内，他的鞋子留在外面，我听见他在帐篷里翻找，准备安顿下来。

Swallowing, I hesitate only a moment longer, then part the flaps and duck my head inside. It's a little cramped, not to mention dark, but holding the flaps open allows a tiny bit of ambient light to filter into the tent, enough to let me see by.
我咽了口唾沫，稍作迟疑后，便拨开帐篷的门帘，低头钻入。空间略显狭窄，且光线昏暗，但撑开门帘让少许外界光线渗入，足以让我勉强视物。

It lets Shinji see me, too. He pauses in his squirming, frowning at me. Then he opens his mouth, probably to ask where my sleeping bag is, but when I just stare mutely back at him, he instead nods and scoots aside, making room for me in the blankets.
它也让真嗣注意到了我。他停止扭动，皱眉望向我。本想开口询问我的睡袋在哪，但见我默不作声地回望，他便点了点头，挪动身体，在毯子中为我腾出了位置。

That's all it would have taken? Hell.
就这么简单？真是见鬼了。

Kicking off my shoes, I slip inside, then zip the flaps mostly shut. Near-total darkness descends, forcing me to find my way around through blind fumbling, and I mutter an apology when my open hand comes in contact with Shinji's face. That means I'm close, though, so a moment later I drop to the ground, rolling to my side and claiming a portion of the blanket.
脱下鞋子，我悄然进入帐篷，随后将拉链大致拉上。四周顿时陷入几乎完全的黑暗，我只能靠摸索前行，不小心触碰到真嗣的脸时，我轻声道歉。这表明我已靠近他，随即我坐下，侧身一滚，占据了毯子的一角。

I'm sleeping with him. And he's letting me.
我正和他同床共枕，他对此并不介意。

Cloth rustles behind me but he doesn't touch me, doesn't start to cuddle. Is he afraid to? Like he thinks I'd do this but would freak out if he touched me? Chewing a lip, I scoot backwards until my ass and back are resting against his side; that should at least let him know that contact is okay. I can tell his arm is rigid, though, like he's terrified of touching anything he shouldn't. Eventually, though, he relaxes, and his breath grows more even.
身后传来布料的摩擦声，他却并未伸手拥抱我。难道是心存畏惧？仿佛他觉得我虽会如此，但一旦触碰便会惊慌失措？我轻咬下唇，缓缓后移，直至背与臀紧贴他的身侧，以此暗示他接触无妨。他的手臂紧绷，似是生怕触犯禁忌。不过，他终究放松下来，呼吸也渐趋平稳。

It still smells like nylon in here. And like smoke and Shinji.
这里依旧弥漫着尼龙、烟味和真嗣的气息。

Long moments pass in the muted silence inside the tent, and it occurs to me that he's probably asleep. I suppose I could actually cuddle up to him now, rather than waiting for the reverse to happen, but... I don't really want to impose. Things are different now, and I've already asked to sleep in his blankets; maybe he just wants some personal space now. I don't know. From now on I can only take what he wants to give.
帐篷内久久无声，我猜他大概已经入睡。此刻，我本可以主动靠近他，而非等待他来亲近，然而...我不想显得唐突。如今情况已变，我已请求在他的毯子里共眠；或许他现在需要些私人空间。我不得而知。今后，我只能接受他愿意给予的。

Even so, this is comfortable. It makes me feel good, even happy, and I want this every night if I can have it.
尽管如此，这种感觉很舒适。它让我心情愉悦，甚至感到幸福，如果可能，我愿每晚都能享受这份惬意。

Wow. I do, don't I?
哇，我确实是的，对吧？

I'm... falling in love with him. Or maybe I'm already there.
我似乎...已经爱上了他。或许我早已深陷其中。

By now my eyes have grown accustomed to the darkness, and I stare along the blanketed tent floor. Love. After a realization like that, I would have expected my heart to be pounding, but I still feel calm. Relaxed. Like this is nothing new, or if it is, it's something I don't need to fight.
现在，我的双眼已习惯了黑暗，我凝视着铺满毯子的帐篷地面。爱。经历了那样的领悟，我原以为心会剧烈跳动，然而我依旧感到平静。放松。似乎这一切并不陌生，即便陌生，也是我不必与之抗争的。

Shinji. It's Shinji. The idiot. I... don't feel disgusted, though. There's way more to him than his simple demeanor would suggest, and I think he might actually understand me now. And after all the shit we've put each other through, the fact that he's still willing to hang out with me, and actually enjoy it, that he'll let me sleep with him with no questions asked... he must love me too. Whether he knows it or not. The sleeping thing I find especially telling; this is a big risk for someone as withdrawn as Shinji. Or me. You just don't go to lengths like this for someone you don't care about.
真嗣。就是真嗣。那个傻瓜。我...并不觉得反感。他远比表面所见要深邃，我觉得他现在或许真的懂我了。经历了我们之间的种种波折，他依旧愿意与我相伴，并且乐在其中，他允许我与他同床共枕，不问缘由...他必定也爱着我。无论他是否自知。我特别觉得这种同眠的行为意味深长；这对像真嗣这样内向的人来说是个巨大的冒险。或者说对我而言。你不会为了一个你不在乎的人做到这般地步。

I... suppose this is why I've been teasing him so much, then. I wanted him to take me up on it. I'd better keep trying, then.
我...想来这就是我为何一直逗他的原因。我其实是希望他能接受我的挑战。看来我得继续努力才行。

Behind me he exhales slowly, then rolls over. Warmth presses against my back, the smell of wood smoke, and then his arm finds its way around my waist.
他在我身后缓缓呼气，随即翻身。一股暖意紧贴我的后背，夹杂着木柴烟的气息，他的手臂随之环抱住我的腰。

I close my eyes. Heat flushes inside, making my fingers tingle and my chest flutter. Even though my arm is starting to hurt where I'm lying on it, I don't want to move, ever. I'd stay like this forever if I could.
我闭上双眼，体内涌起一股热流，手指微微发麻，胸口怦然跳动。虽然压着的手臂开始疼痛，我却丝毫不想动弹，真希望永远这样静止。

"Asuka?" His voice is a warm whisper next to my ear. "Are you awake?"
"Asuka，你醒着吗？" 他的声音温柔地在我耳畔响起。

I nod slightly against his pillow. Maybe he wasn't asleep, then.
我对着他的枕头轻轻点了点头。看来他当时可能并没有睡着。

"Why... why do we do this?" His arm tightens briefly, clarifying what he means.
"为什么...我们究竟为什么要这么做？" 他手臂微微一紧，意在言明。

I chew a lip at this, uncertain how much to tell him or what I would even like to say. After a moment I swallow. "Because I like it."
我咬着嘴唇，犹豫着该透露多少给他，连自己想说什么都不清楚。过了一会儿，我咽了咽口水。“因为我真的很喜欢。”

"Why?" 为什么呢？

I'm a little surprised he would endanger this by asking about it so bluntly, but I suppose if I were him I'd want to know too. Want to see if it meant what I thought it meant, or if I was just setting myself up to get hurt again later. Plus, I guess he did this last time, too, kicked me out of his blankets even though it clearly hurt him to do so. Truth must be a higher value for him than mindless comfort, now... which just tells me I am right to love him.
我有些惊讶他竟如此直白地提出这个问题，让局面变得危险，但若换作我，恐怕也想弄个明白。我想确认这是否真如我所想，还是我自寻烦恼，日后又得承受伤害。况且，记得上次他也是如此，明明自己心里难受，却还是把我从他的毯子里赶了出去。看来对他而言，真相远比无谓的安慰重要...这更让我坚信，爱他是正确的选择。

Still, I'm not entirely sure how to answer him. Gripping his arm, I lift it gently aside to give me room to roll over and face him. He stares back at me, so close in the darkness. Close enough to kiss, but he's not smiling; what little I can see of his expression is as thoughtful as it is worried. What to say? How much to reveal right now?
尽管如此，我仍不确定该如何回应他。我握住他的手臂，轻柔地挪开，给自己腾出空间翻身面对他。他在黑暗中与我四目相对，近得足以亲吻，但他的脸上没有笑容；我能捕捉到的他的表情，既深思又带着忧虑。该说些什么？此刻该透露多少？

Eventually he just smiles, a tired but genuine expression. "Actually, you know what?" One hand finds my upper arm, squeezes it gently. "Don't worry about it."
最后，他露出一个疲惫却真挚的微笑。“其实，你知道吗？”他一只手搭在我的上臂，温柔地捏了捏。“别放在心上。”

I guess I don't have to say anything at all. He gets it.
我想我无需多言，他已经懂了。

Nodding, I roll back over, pulling his own arm back into place, back where it belongs. He settles into place, sighing, and I find I'm doing the same.
我点头回应，随即翻身，将他的手臂轻轻放回原位。他安然躺下，轻叹一声，而我也不自觉地跟着叹了口气。

So. I can't mention it yet, but he understands anyway, and is gracious enough to give me a dignified way out even though we both know.
因此，我目前还无法明说，但他已心领神会，并慷慨地为我提供了一个体面的退出途径，我们彼此心照不宣。

He's the strong one now. Stronger than me. I wonder how long it's been that way.
他如今比我更强大了。我不清楚这种状态已持续了多久。

I could just as easily let it go, let him be strong and take care of me, but I have to show him that even though he can, he doesn't have to. I have to say something, something of substance. Squeezing my eyes shut again, I shake my head slightly. "Shinji, why do you put up with me?"
我原本可以轻松放手，让他坚强起来并照顾我，但我必须让他明白，虽然他有能力这么做，却并非非做不可。我得说些有分量的话。再次闭上眼睛，我轻轻摇头。“真嗣，你为什么能容忍我呢？”

"I... really like having you around," he admits. "I was going crazy without you, you know."
我真的很喜欢有你在身边，"他坦白说。"你不在的时候，我简直要疯了。

I know how that is. "Yeah, but... why me? Why Asuka?"
我明白那种感受。“对，可是...为什么偏偏是我？为什么是明日香？”

Silence. His breathing is slow and even, and so is mine.
四周一片寂静。他的呼吸平稳而均匀，我的同样如此。

Eventually I can hear him lick his lips. "We're... the same," he explains; his voice is so soft I can barely hear it. "We just went in opposite directions."
最后，我听到他舔了舔嘴唇。“其实我们本质相同，”他轻声说道，声音微弱到几乎难以捕捉。“只是各自选择了相反的道路。”

After a moment I nod. I'll believe that.
片刻后，我点头表示认同。我愿意相信这一点。

Before I realize what I'm doing, I'm sliding a hand along his arm; my fingers find his own and thread through them, then press his hand against my stomach. "You still need me, then?" I recall softly.
不知不觉中，我的手已顺着他的手臂滑去；指尖触碰到他的手，穿过他的指缝，将他的手紧贴在我的腹部。“看来你还是需要我呢？”我轻声回想起。

"I do." He swallows. "I... don't want you to go away again."
我愿意。"他哽咽着说，"我...真的不想你再离开我了。

I exhale slowly. "Then I'll stay right here."
我慢慢呼气，说道：“那我就留在这儿。”

### Chapter 15 Finale: Più Vivo
终曲：更加生动

I awake feeling... warm. Comfortable. Asuka is still here.
醒来时感到温暖而舒适，明日香依然在身边。

It's clear we've moved around somewhat during the night, but she's still on her side with her back to me, or is again, and I'm still holding her tightly around the waist. Spooning, I guess. She must like that as much as I do.
显然，夜里我们挪动了不少，但她依旧侧身躺着，背朝着我，或者又回到了这个姿势，我依然紧紧地环抱着她的腰。这应该是相拥而眠吧。她肯定和我一样享受这种感觉。

Rain has moved in, it seems, and is now whispering against the roof of the tent. Colorless morning light filters in through the plain utilitarian green of the walls, leaving a sleepy glow in the interior with us. Asuka didn't zip the flaps totally shut last night, but even so the thing is well-made enough that it hasn't let any rain in; the mixed scent of blood and wet earth has drifted in instead.
雨水似乎已经悄然降临，此刻正轻柔地敲打着帐篷顶。无色的晨光透过朴实无华的绿色篷布，为帐篷内部投下了一片朦胧的光晕。昨晚明日香并未将帐篷拉链完全拉紧，但好在帐篷质量过硬，并未让雨水侵入；反倒是混合着血腥与湿润泥土的气息悄然飘入。

My face is in her hair. It's ticklish, but not so much that I need to move.
我的脸埋在她的秀发里，感觉有点痒，但还没到非得挪开的程度。

It's kind of a strange sensation, holding her so tightly. I always figured a girl would be sort of... soft and fleshy, but here her back and stomach are almost as hard as mine are. She's toned under the curves. I wonder if she always was, or if this is a result of living as we have for the past month or so. Either way, it feels nice.
抱着她有种奇妙的感觉。我原以为女孩的身体应该是柔软的，但她的背和腹部却几乎和我一样结实。曲线之下藏着紧实的肌肉。不知她本就如此，还是这一个月来我们共同生活的结果。不管怎样，这感觉挺好。

Sighing, I let my eyes slide half-shut and just drift. She's still holding my hand.
我叹了口气，半闭上眼睛，任由思绪游离。她仍旧紧握着我的手。

I wonder if we're together now. A couple. I have to think so, after the conversation last night, after sleeping like this, but with her it's best never to sit and guess. I'll have to make sure at some point... but not right now. This is too nice to disturb, even with meaningful questions.
我想知道我们现在是否已经成为一对。经过昨晚的交谈和这样的共眠，我不得不这么想，但对她，最好还是别凭空猜测。我得找个时机确认...只是不是现在。此刻太美好了，连有意义的问题都不愿打扰这份宁静。

Time slips past. The morning steals onward in a gentle murmur of rain.
时光悄然流逝。清晨在细雨的轻柔细语中缓缓推进。

I know she's awake -- she scratched an itch on her shoulder a little bit ago -- but she hasn't really moved and hasn't spoken. And neither have I. Her shirt has ridden up a little bit overnight, so my pinky is actually resting against skin rather than cotton like the others. I want to caress her stomach, but... at the same time I don't. Simple contact is enough. For now.
我知道她已经醒了——刚才她还轻挠了一下肩膀——但她并未真正动弹，也没开口说话。我同样静默。夜里她的衬衫略微上移，使得我的小指正触碰着她的肌肤，而非像其他手指那样贴着棉质布料。我渴望抚摸她的腹部，然而……内心又有所犹豫。此刻，简单的触碰已足够。

Eventually, though, I sigh. "Asuka?"
最后，我不禁叹息道：“明日香？”

"Mmm?" 嗯？

"Are you awake?" 你醒了吗？

"Mmm." 嗯。

I bite my lips, not really willing to speak what's next but at the same time unable to avoid it. "We... should get up."
我咬着嘴唇，虽不愿说出接下来的话，却又难以回避。"我们...该起床了。"

"Mmm!" 嗯嗯！

"Look, I have to pee," I explain helplessly. "And I'm getting hungry. And besides, there's always tonight." And all the nights from now on.
"看，我得去方便一下，"我无奈地解释。"而且我也饿了。再说，不是还有今晚嘛。"还有今后无数个夜晚。

"Mmm..." She lets go of my hand with obvious reluctance.
"嗯……" 她带着明显的不情愿，松开了我的手。

I sit up, letting my fingers slide along the exposed line of her stomach before realizing what I'm doing, but she doesn't seem to care. Or notice. "Are you going to get up or stay here?"
我坐起身，手指不经意间滑过她裸露的腹部，意识到自己的举动时，她却似乎并不介意，甚至未曾察觉。"你是要起床，还是打算继续留在这里？"

"I'll get up." Her voice cracks, hoarse from sleep, and the sound brings a smile to my face. Slowly she pushes herself up, then twists half-around to regard me, brushing hair from her face.
"我这就起来。"她的嗓音因刚睡醒而略显沙哑，这声音让我不禁微笑。她缓缓起身，半转过来注视着我，同时用手拨开脸上的发丝。

"Okay." Quickly grabbing my cap and fitting it to my head, I unzip the tent flaps, find the cleaning stuff and hurry off through the trees. The rain isn't very heavy, fortunately, but it still smells like blood. I'll have to shower afterwards, if it lets up today. I think half the reason I would want people to start coming back here is so that their LCL leaves the environment and goes back into their bodies, where it all belongs. There are nights when I dream of clean rain.
"好的。" 我迅速抓起帽子戴上，拉开帐篷拉链，拿起清洁工具，匆匆穿过树林。幸好雨势不大，但空气中依旧有股血腥味。如果今天雨停，我得洗个澡。我之所以希望人们重返此地，一半是希望他们的 LCL 能离开环境，回归他们体内，这才是它们应有的归宿。有些夜晚，我梦见清澈的雨水。

When I get back, Asuka is standing outside the tent, hands on hips, scowling up at the sky. "Why don't we have any raincoats?"
我回来时，明日香站在帐篷外，双手叉腰，眉头紧锁地望着天空。“我们怎么就没准备雨衣呢？”

"I... don't know?" Shrugging, I put the cleaning stuff away, then crack open the bin of breakfast foods. "Because it doesn't rain very often, and I never thought of it, I guess."
我...真不清楚。" 我耸了耸肩，将清洁用品归位，接着打开存放早餐的箱子。"大概是因为这里雨水不多，我也没太在意过这个问题。

"Well, think more." Rain is slicking her crimson hair down, making her looked a little drowned, which is bad, but it makes her shirt cling to her, which is good.
"嗯，再想想。" 雨水淋湿了她那鲜红的头发，使她显得有些狼狈，这虽不妙，却也让她的衬衫紧贴身形，倒也添了几分魅力。

I give her a sour look. "Is there a reason you couldn't have thought of it too?"
我带着一丝不满地看了她一眼，问道：“你难道就没想过这事儿吗？”

She blinks at this, then rolls her eyes. "I don't have to put up with this," she mutters, swiping the cleaning materials from where I left them. "Smartass." Blue eyes regard me narrowly as she strides into the trees.
她对此眨了眨眼，随即翻了个白眼，嘟囔道：“我才不受这份气。”说着，她从我放的地方一把抓起清洁用品，丢下一句“自作聪明”，便用那双蓝眼睛锐利地瞥了我一眼，然后大步流星地走进了树林。

Smiling, I find an energy bar, then close the tub again. It's a little nauseating to eat something that LCL is raining on, but it's not too bad, and I'm kind of used to it.
我微笑着，从桶里翻出一根能量棒，随即又把桶盖合上。虽然 LCL 液体滴落其上，吃起来略感不适，但已逐渐适应，尚可接受。

Shortly Asuka returns, still wearing the same clothes, which makes sense; it's raining, so they're already ruined. May as well wait until it stops, and change then. I'm doing the same thing.
Asuka 不久后回来了，还是穿着那身衣服，这很正常；外面正下着雨，衣服已经湿了，不如等雨停了再换。我也是这么打算的。

I'm just finishing my breakfast up when she draws near to get something for herself. I nod, moving aside to give her room. "Did you have anything in mind for today?"
我正吃完早餐，她走过来取东西。我点头示意，挪开身子给她让出空间。"今天有什么计划吗？"

She grimaces. "I wanted to mess with the generator, but... not so much in the rain."
她皱起眉头说：“本来想去摆弄一下发电机，可这雨天还是算了。”

I nod again. I would also bet she's procrastinating since she knows it'll be a pain getting it down from the truck.
我又点了点头。我猜她也在拖延，毕竟从卡车上卸货确实挺费劲的。

Vague muttering issues from my side while she roots around in our food, looking for something that isn't cereal. Soon she finds it in the form of another bar. I know she doesn't really care for them, and in truth I don't either, but they're easy.
我这边含糊地嘟囔着，她则在食物堆里翻找，想找点非麦片的东西。不久，她翻出一根能量棒。其实她并不怎么喜欢这玩意儿，我也是，但胜在方便。

While she eats, I wander over to the log-bench and sit on it, stretching legs idly in front of me. She follows, sitting beside me, actually close enough for our hips to touch. Rain continues to patter into mud and vegetation all around, dripping off the brim of my hat, hazing the view of broken Tokyo-3 below.
她用餐时，我闲步至木制长椅处落座，随意伸展双腿。她随后而至，紧挨着我坐下，近得我们的髋部几乎相触。雨滴持续敲打着四周的泥土与植物，从我的帽檐滑落，朦胧了眼前残破的东京 3 号景象。

"What are you thinking about?" she asks around a mouthful of energy bar.
她一边嚼着能量棒，一边问道：“你在想什么呢？”

I blink, a little surprised she would ask, but I guess the rules are changing. "I haven't played the cello in a while. I was thinking it might be nice to get one."
我眨了眨眼，对她的问题感到有些意外，但我想规则或许正在变化。"我已许久未拉大提琴了。我在考虑，买一把或许是个不错的主意。"

"In the rain?" she snorts. "And where would you put it?"
在雨里？" 她轻蔑地哼了一声。"那你想放哪里呢？

I shrug. "I don't know. That's why I was only thinking about it, not suggesting it."
我耸耸肩说：“我也不清楚。所以只是心里想想，没打算提出来。”

She falls silent, eating. Rain pushes odd little strands of hair around on her face.
她默默地吃着，雨滴拨弄着她脸上散落的几缕发丝。

"What about you?" Turnabout should be fair play.
你怎么样？反转也要公平才对。

Making a face, she stuffs the last of the bar into her mouth, then starts chewing. Long moments pass before she speaks again. "I... think you were right about the GeoFront crater," she admits quietly, not looking at me. "We should visit."
她做了个鬼脸，将最后一块巧克力塞进嘴里，咀嚼起来。片刻后，她才再次开口，轻声说道：“我……我想你关于 GeoFront 陨石坑的看法是对的，我们应该去一趟。”

I chew a lip, eyeing her sideways. What brought this on? "Do you want to do that today?"
我轻咬下唇，斜睨着她。这突如其来的想法是怎么回事？"你今天想做那件事吗？"

She nods absently. "We should get some more gas while we're in the city, if we go."
她心不在焉地点头道：“进城的话，我们得顺便加点油。”

For the generator, she means, not just the Humvee. "Okay. Do you want to go now?"
她指的是发电机，而不只是悍马车。"好的。你现在就想去吗？"

Her eyes slide thoughtfully towards me. "Yeah. Let's get the usual stuff first."
她若有所思地瞥向我，说道：“好的，我们先点平时常吃的那些。”

Flashlights and the bat, of course. I nod, rising to go grab it all, and she just stands in the rain and watches me. There's little conversation on the way to the truck, and once we're crossing the pavement I hand the stuff to her; she accepts it without expression.
当然，手电筒和蝙蝠是必备的。我点头起身去取，她则静静站在雨中注视着我。前往卡车的路上我们几乎没有言语交流，当我递给她那些物品时，她面无表情地接了过去。

I ponder that as I climb into the truck. She's pretty quiet today, and so far no flirting. Something's bothering her, then. The crater? Or is she having second thoughts about us already? I have a hard time believing so after how she wanted to stay in bed, but... I guess I'll find out before long.
我爬上卡车时陷入了沉思。她今天异常沉默，至今未见调情迹象。显然，她心事重重，是因为那个陨石坑吗？还是她已经开始对我们的事产生了疑虑？尽管难以置信，毕竟她之前还那么依恋床榻，但...我想不久便会揭晓答案。

A quick three-point turn gets the truck pointed in the right direction and I set off rumbling down the hill. I'm not really worried about directions, as this highway should head right to the crater, so instead I worry about the rain. Despite getting the headlights and windshield wipers working, I find I'm gripping the wheel white-knuckled and leaning forward in my seat as though it'll help me see the road better. Asuka watches me with obvious scorn, but I ignore her.
迅速完成三点掉头后，卡车顺利转向正确方向，我随即沿着山坡轰鸣前行。方向问题我并不太担心，毕竟这条公路直通火山口，我更忧心的是雨水。尽管车灯和雨刷已恢复正常，我仍不自觉地紧握方向盘，指节泛白，身体前倾，似乎这样能让我更清晰地看到前路。明日香在一旁明显带着轻蔑地看着我，但我选择不予理会。

"Crater first?" she suggests quietly as we're crossing into the city. "Then gas afterwards?"
先去火山口怎么样？"她在我们进入城市时轻声提议。"之后再去加气站如何？

"Sure." 当然。

The purr of the engine and the rhythmic whimper of the wipers provide a monotonic backdrop to our travel. Asuka rides leaning against the passenger's side window, staring blankly at the passing city blocks.
引擎的轻柔轰鸣与雨刷有节奏的轻响，为我们旅途提供了单调的背景音。明日香倚靠在乘客侧车窗上，眼神空洞地凝视着不断掠过的城市街区。

Eventually I clear my throat and half-glance at her. "Are you okay?"
我终于清了清嗓子，半侧着脸看向她，轻声问道：“你没事吧？”

She twitches but doesn't look away from the road. "Shinji... I'm fine."
她身体微微一颤，目光却始终未离路面。“真嗣……我很好。”

I nod. We're almost there anyway.
我点头示意。毕竟我们马上就到了。

Soon I slow the Humvee, then stop it a good hundred meters from where the road simply disappears in a gargantuan pile of dirt. After turning the truck off, I twist to regard Asuka momentarily, but she's just staring back at me with... I would say trepidation shading her features. Rain drums patiently against the roof and windshield.
不久，我便减速，将悍马车停在离道路被巨量泥土吞没处约百米的地方。熄灭引擎后，我侧身望向明日香，她正以略带忧虑的神情凝视着我。雨点持续而有节奏地敲击着车顶和车窗。

Eventually her lips twist helplessly and, with a shrug, she opens the door and slips to the ground. I do likewise on my side, remembering to turn the vehicle lights off only when it pings at me.
最终，她无奈地撇了撇嘴，耸耸肩，打开车门，悄然下车。我也从另一侧下车，直到车子发出提示音，才记起要关掉车灯。

In silence the two of us walk along the empty four-lane highway, crossing giant blocky directives in yellow paint, passing under electronic signs now hanging black and lifeless in the rain. Ahead of us, the massive mound of torn-up earth grows steadily larger; it stretches as far as I can see in both directions, shrinking into the distance until buildings and rain obscure it.
我们默默地走在空无一人的四车道公路上，沿途是巨大的黄色油漆块状指示牌，头顶的电子显示屏在雨中黯淡无光。前方，那座巨大的土堆愈发显眼，向两侧延伸至视线尽头，最终被建筑和雨雾所遮蔽。

When we reach the edge, Asuka starts climbing without hesitation, and I scamper for a moment to catch up. Bloody rain puddles in little depressions in the dirt, spilling and trickling down the slope; with every step the mud squelches, threatening to steal a shoe. We climb carefully, and I pause every now and then to make sure Asuka isn't disregarding her safety, but true to her word she seems fine. Shortly we rise above the level of nearby buildings the tumbling dirt has half-entombed, but we keep climbing. I find it's easier if I don't look back, or down.
抵达边缘后，Asuka 立即开始攀爬，我紧随其后。血雨在泥土的低洼处积成小水坑，顺着斜坡缓缓流淌；每一步都伴随着泥泞的吱吱声，仿佛要吞噬鞋子。我们谨慎地向上爬，我时不时停下确认 Asuka 的安全，她确实如自己所说，状态良好。很快，我们便超过了那些被泥土半掩的建筑物，继续攀登。我发现，不回头也不向下看，攀爬起来更为轻松。

Before long Asuka plants a foot atop the mud in front of her, then pauses. When I reach her side, I can see why.
不久，明日香将一只脚稳稳地踏在面前的泥地上，随即停下脚步。我走到她身旁，这才明白她为何驻足。

The crater is... enormous. At least a kilometer across, maybe several; I have difficulty judging the distance with nothing in the middle to give it perspective. The other side is so far away I can barely make it out through the rain, and in between is a perfect sunken hemisphere of open space. The edges, despite their age, still have a clear scraped look to them, as though the Black Moon hacked them up while it was rising, and while all the dirt that happened to be above it got pushed to the sides to create the massive ring we're standing on now. Below, every hundred meters or so I can see odd bits of twisted pipe or hanging cable sticking out from the ground, all quite literally torn apart upon the Black Moon's ascent. Greyish light glitters in the middle of the crater, and it takes me a moment to realize there's a pond there, or lake, where water has happened to gather since Third Impact. We're maybe... two hundred meters above the ground we parked on, but it seems like nothing at all compared to the depth of the wound in the earth in front of me.
这个陨石坑巨大无比，直径至少有一公里，甚至可能更宽；由于中间空无一物，我难以判断确切距离。对面的边缘在雨中几乎模糊不清，而中间则是一个完美的凹陷半球形空间。尽管历经岁月，边缘依旧清晰，仿佛黑月升起时将其撕裂，而原本覆盖其上的泥土被推向两侧，形成了我们现在所站的巨大环形。下方每隔百米左右，就能看到扭曲的管道或悬挂的电缆从地面伸出，显然是在黑月升起时被撕裂的。 火山口中央，灰暗的光芒闪烁着，我片刻后才察觉到那里竟有一片水域，或许是池塘，亦或是湖泊，自第三次冲击以来，水便汇聚于此。我们或许离停车地面约两百米高，但与眼前这地球上的深邃伤痕相比，这点高度显得微不足道。

"It's so huge," murmurs Asuka beside me, staring blankly into the hole. "It sort of... puts things in perspective, knowing we were messing around with power on this sort of scale."
它真是巨大无比，"飞鸟在我身旁低声说道，目光空洞地盯着那个洞。"这让人不禁感慨，我们竟在如此庞大的力量面前嬉戏。

"Not you and me," I point out just as quietly. "Rei did. And my father."
并非你我，"我同样轻声说道，"是 Rei 和我父亲所为。

Rain patters wetly into the mud all around. "I meant we, NERV," she explains.
雨水淅淅沥沥地落在周围的泥泞里。“我指的是我们 NERV，”她解释说。

I nod. There's not much I can really add that won't just sound petty in the face of the sheer size on display here.
我点头表示认同。面对此地展现的宏大规模，我再多言恐怕只会显得琐碎。

"I hated it, you know," she continues, speaking in a quiet monotone. "Instrumentality, I mean. I hated it, how little control I had, how everybody could see into my soul. It didn't even matter that I could see into theirs too; I didn't want to. I just wanted to get away. So then you showed up, and you were asking me for help, and you were just part of the thing I was trying to get away from, and I hated you at that point anyway, so I didn't hold back. I told you exactly what I thought. And then you killed me."
我真的很反感，你知道的，"她继续说，语气平静而单调。"我是说，我讨厌那种融合感，讨厌自己几乎无法掌控，讨厌每个人都能看透我的内心。即便我也能看透他们的，那也无济于事；我根本不想这么做。我只想逃离。然后你出现了，向我求助，而你不过是我想逃离的那一切的一部分，那时我反正也讨厌你，所以我毫不保留。我直截了当地告诉你我的真实想法。结果你却杀了我。

I roll lips between my teeth as she pauses, unwilling to add anything or even to move until she's clearly done. Rain drips steadily from my hat, past my eyes.
她停顿之际，我轻咬着嘴唇，默不作声，静待她把话说完。雨水不断从帽檐滑落，滴入我的眼帘。

"I let you do it, too. I was just so... so tired of being hurt all the time, of hurting you, and I just wanted to go away so that the pain would go with me. But you can't die there. Pain doesn't just disappear. I have some vague memories of Misato and Kaji, and then the next thing I knew, you were gone somewhere, and it was just red, nothing but red, everywhere, and everyone could still see into me. So I found something warm, even though it felt... spiky... too, and I went to it, and it turned out to be you."
我也让你这么做了。我只是太...太厌倦了总是被伤害，伤害你，我只想离开，让痛苦随我而去。但你不能在那里死去。痛苦不会就这么消失。我有些模糊的记忆关于美里和加持，然后下一刻，你就消失了，只剩下红色，到处都是红色，每个人还能看透我。于是我找到了一些温暖的东西，虽然它也感觉...刺痛...我也靠近了它，结果发现那就是你。

She pauses to swallow. "I... I didn't get here so quickly because I learned what I needed to from Instrumentality and then graduated from it or something. I got here because I ran away from it. I learned more right beforehand, when I found out Mama was in Unit-02, than I did during Instrumentality itself. I cheated, Shinji."
她顿了顿，咽了咽口水。“我……我之所以这么快来到这里，并非因为我从‘人类补完计划’中汲取了所需，然后顺利毕业或怎样。我是因为逃离了那里。我是在得知妈妈在二号机里之前，才学到了更多，而非在‘人类补完计划’本身期间。我作弊了，真嗣。”

I eye her sideways, but she's still just staring straight ahead, probably not seeing anything at all. "I don't think you can cheat," I offer after a moment. "Not everyone is going to like it up there, and people are going to have different reasons for leaving. I don't think you need to worry about it."
我斜眼偷瞄她，她却依旧目不斜视，或许什么也没入眼。"我想你无法作弊，"片刻后我开口，"并非人人都适应那里，大家离开各有缘由。你无需为此忧虑。"

She sighs. "Shinji, don't you see? I just--"
她叹息道：“真嗣，你还不明白吗？我只是——”

"Asuka." I cut her off, keeping my voice gentle. "It's okay."
"Asuka，" 我轻声打断她，“没事的。”

Clothing shifts beside me, and I turn to find her watching me out of the corners of her eyes, doubtful, almost wary. She doesn't want to believe me, but doesn't think she knows enough to disagree.
衣物在我身旁微微挪动，我一转头，便见她正用眼角偷偷打量我，眼神中满是疑虑，甚至带着几分警惕。她不愿轻信我的话，却又觉得自己所知有限，难以提出异议。

I don't say anything, just nod encouragingly, and she relaxes somewhat. She must be getting it, understanding one of the little things that's caused her as much pain as anything else, that she's always judged herself far more harshly than anyone else ever would. Especially anyone who loved her.
我默不作声，只是鼓励地微微点头，她便略感放松。她想必是领悟到了，那些看似微不足道的小事，实则给她带来了极大的痛苦，她总是对自己比任何人都苛刻。尤其是那些深爱她的人。

Eventually she closes her eyes, nodding once, slumping slightly; tension fades from her as though washed away by the rain. "Yeah," she whispers. "Maybe... maybe you're right."
最终，她闭上眼睛，轻轻点头，身体略显松弛；紧张感如同被雨水冲刷般从她身上褪去。“嗯，”她轻声道，“可能……你说的没错。”

This might be as good a time as any to make sure I understand the new rules, I realize. Licking my lips, I shuffle over to grip her shoulder. When she doesn't react, I press on. "I was hoping you'd come back, you know. Despite what happened right away I... really did wanted to talk to you again; I wanted to explain what I could and maybe... I don't really know. I didn't have it all figured out when you appeared. But I'm glad you came. The first one back, too. You're always so worried about being weak, but looking at that, I'd say you're the strongest personality in the world."
这或许是个恰当的时机，确认我对新规则的理解，我意识到。舔了舔嘴唇，我挪过去轻触她的肩膀。她没有反应，我便继续说：“我曾盼望你能回来，你知道的。尽管一开始发生了那些事，我……真的很想再和你聊聊；我想解释我能解释的，或许……我也不太清楚。你出现时，我并没有完全想清楚。但我很高兴你来了。还是第一个回来的。你总是担心自己软弱，但看这个，我认为你是世界上最坚强的人。”

She exhales sharply through her nose, the faintest of chuckles, and sways slightly. "You would say that."
她鼻子里轻哼一声，带着一丝笑意，身体微微晃动。“你当然会这么说。”

"I wouldn't have, always," I recall.
我记得，我本不会总是如此。

"No," she agrees after a moment. "I suppose not."
不，" 她稍作思考后同意道，"我想应该不是。

Nodding, I slide my hand to her other shoulder and tug her gently in my direction... and she thumps into my side. A long sigh escapes her lips, and with it some weight I wasn't aware she carried until now.
我点头示意，手顺势滑向她的另一侧肩膀，轻柔地将她拉近。她顺势靠在我身旁，发出一声悠长的叹息，仿佛卸下了我未曾察觉的重担。

This is it, then. The old walls are just... gone. She's mine, and I'm hers.
看来就是这样了。那些古老的墙壁已经……不复存在。她属于我，我也属于她。

For a time neither of us speaks or moves; I keep my arm around her shoulders, still in a little disbelief that I can do this to her at all. Warm liquid trickles down my face, down my back, and continues to push her hair around, but it's barely a nuisance and we ignore it. Somewhere above, thunder rumbles, echoing fitfully across the empty face of the world.
有那么一会儿，我们俩都沉默着，一动不动；我依然搂着她的肩膀，心中仍有些难以置信我能这样对她。温热的液体从我的脸颊滑落到背上，继续拨弄着她的头发，但这几乎不值一提，我们选择忽略它。头顶上方，雷声隆隆作响，断断续续地在空无一物的世界中回荡。

Eventually I turn my head slightly towards Asuka, almost touching her with my hat. "I'm not sure how safe it is up here." This pile of dirt might not be stable, and if either of us fell in there, I don't know that it would be possible to get out.
最后，我轻轻侧头看向明日香，差点用帽子碰到她。“我不敢肯定这里是否安全。”这堆土可能不稳固，万一我们谁掉进去，恐怕难以脱身。

"Probably not very," she murmurs, shifting against my side. "You want to go?"
可能不太想，"她轻声呢喃，身体向我这边靠了靠。"你想去吗？

"Do you?" 你呢？

"Sure." 当然。

Nodding, I drop my arm from her shoulders but she remains leaning against me, so I wait. "We're not too far from that beach," I point out. "We could see if anyone else has shown up yet."
我点头示意，将手臂从她肩上移开，但她依旧依偎着我，我便耐心等待。“离那个海滩不远了，”我提议道，“不妨去看看是否有人已经到了。”

She stretches lazily, fists to the sky, body quivering as she exhales slowly. "You know what?" she mutters. "Fuck 'em. They'll get here when they get here."
她懒洋洋地伸展身体，双拳高举向天，随着缓缓的呼气，身体微微颤动。“你明白吗？”她低声说道，“管他们呢。他们想什么时候到就什么时候到。”

I actually laugh at this, then turn around and survey the slope we just climbed not half an hour ago. It seems somehow... much steeper now, from above. "It would almost be easier just to slide down," I sigh.
我对此不禁笑了出来，随后转身望向我们不久前攀登的斜坡。从高处俯瞰，它似乎显得更为陡峭。“几乎觉得直接滑下去还更轻松些，”我叹了口气。

"Yeah. You'd love that, until you hit the road." Shaking her head at my idiocy, she starts navigating her way carefully down the hill of dirt and clay.
"是啊，你一开始会挺享受，但一上路就未必了。"她对我这愚蠢的举动摇了摇头，然后小心翼翼地沿着泥土和黏土的斜坡往下走。

I follow a few steps behind her, moving awkwardly, often keeping a hand on the ground behind me to help with my balance. I'm not as coordinated as she is.
我跟随在她后面几步，动作显得有些笨拙，经常需要用手撑着地面来帮助自己保持平衡。我的协调性不如她。

The descent takes probably twice as long as the ascent did. Asuka finishes well before me, but waits patiently at the base of the hill until I hop down to the mud-slick pavement.
下山的时间或许比上山多出一倍。明日香早早抵达，却仍在山脚耐心等候，直至我跳下，踏上那片泥泞滑腻的路面。

"Took you long enough, loser," she mutters, steering me by an arm back towards the truck. Blue eyes scan mildly up and down my body as we walk. "Let's go steal some gas."
你真是慢吞吞的，失败者，"她低声抱怨，拽着我的胳膊向卡车走去。那双蓝眼睛温和地在我身上来回扫视。"走，我们去弄点汽油。

"Sounds good to me." I twitch a little bit when something brushes my ass, but she's just sliding her hand into my back pocket. Trying not to shake my head, I throw an arm around her shoulders again.
"我觉得挺好的。"感觉到有东西触碰我的臀部，我不由自主地抽动了一下，原来她只是把手伸进我的后裤袋。我忍住摇头的冲动，再次将手臂搭回她的肩上。

Once we're back to the Humvee, I climb into the driver's seat and turn it back on, and shortly I'm driving once more through the rain. This was a fairly busy part of town, with a few sizeable apartment complexes, so I direct us towards the parking ramp of one such. Most people living around here probably would have commuted by train, but there should still be enough cars to net us a few cans of gas. I hope.
回到悍马车后，我坐进驾驶座，重新启动车辆，很快便再次在雨中行驶。这里是城镇中较为繁忙的区域，有几栋颇具规模的公寓楼，我便驱车前往其中一座的停车场。虽然住在这附近的人大多可能乘火车通勤，但应该仍有足够多的车辆，让我们能弄到几罐汽油。我对此抱有希望。

A few minutes later I stop in a half-underground parking space lit only by rogue cloud-light spilling in through a chain-link fence on one wall. The slamming of the truck doors reverberates hollowly in the broad space as the two of us make our way to the nearest of the cars, a worn compact with discolored stickers plastered across the back bumper. Once there I glance to Asuka, who has the bat.
几分钟后，我停在了一个半地下的停车场，仅靠一堵墙上铁丝网透进的云光勉强照明。我们走向最近的一辆车时，卡车门的撞击声在空旷的空间中回荡，显得格外空洞。那是一辆破旧的小型车，后保险杠上贴满了褪色的贴纸。到了车旁，我瞥了一眼手持球棒的明日香。

She smiles faintly. "I'll smash windows if you want to check the cars afterwards."
她浅浅一笑，道：“若你想事后查看车辆，我可破窗。”

"Sure." I wait for her to shatter the driver's window of the compact, then lean in and pull the trunk release. In the trunk I find little of interest, just a tennis racket and a set of tools that looks like it's never been used. No gas.
"当然。" 我等她砸破小车的驾驶座车窗后，便探身进去拉动了后备箱的开启装置。后备箱里没什么值得注意的，只有一把网球拍和一套崭新的工具，似乎从未被使用过。没有汽油。

A steady rhythm of increasingly-distant explosions of shattered glass keeps the silence at bay as I move from car to truck to car, checking back seats and trunks. Some five minutes later I stop to examine our total prize, three mismatched cans of gasoline, one of which is mostly empty.
我穿梭在汽车与卡车之间，检查着后座和后备箱，远处碎玻璃爆炸的规律声响逐渐远去，却始终打破不了周围的寂静。大约五分钟后，我停下脚步，清点我们的战利品：三罐不匹配的汽油，其中一罐已近空空如也。

Asuka stands beside me, arms folded across her chest, bat hanging down her side from one clenched fist. "This is great," she concludes flatly. "I'd be surprised if this replaces what we burned just getting down here."
明日香站在我身旁，双臂抱胸，球棒从紧握的拳头中垂落。她语气平淡地总结：“这真是太好了，要是它能抵得上我们为了下来所付出的代价，我倒会感到意外。”

I shrug. "We can get more. And we could get a different car, instead of driving the Humvee all over the place."
我耸了耸肩说：“我们还能再弄到一些。而且，我们可以换辆车，不必总是开着悍马到处跑。”

"Yeah, well, let's worry about the gas for now." Hefting one of the cans, she starts trotting back to the truck. "There have to be more parking places around here. Let's keep moving."
对，先解决汽油问题。" 她拎起一个油桶，快步向卡车走去。"这周围应该还有其他停车位，我们再找找。

Another hour of aimless driving in the area manages to get us enough gas to fuel the Humvee part of the way back up, as well as some extra for the generator which is still in the back with all her other junk. As I pull out of the last parking lot, I eye the sky through the windshield. "I think it's done raining."
在周边漫无目的地又开了一个小时，我们凑够了让悍马车部分路程返回所需的汽油，还给后备箱里的发电机多备了些油。驶离最后一个停车场时，我透过挡风玻璃望向天空，心想：“雨应该停了。”

"I think so too." She frowns for a moment, rubbing her chin. "Actually, head right at this intersection up here. There's some stuff I want to get."
我也这么想。"她皱眉思索片刻，抚摸着下巴。"其实，在这个路口直接右转。我想买点东西。

More stuff. Just what we need. "Fine. What is it?"
又来一堆东西。正是我们需要的。“行吧。那是什么？”

"You'll see." 你会明白的。

I shrug, suppressing a sigh, and wheel the truck around the corner she indicated. Above, grey clouds have started to fracture around the edges, though it's still mostly overcast.
我耸了耸肩，忍住叹息，按照她的指示将卡车转向她所指的拐角。此时，天空中的灰云边缘开始散开，但大部分天空依旧阴沉。

Following Asuka's directions, I navigate through cracked and empty streets to a big electronics retailer in yet another little mall. Lifting an eyebrow, I stop in front of the doors. "What's in here?"
依照明日香的指示，我穿梭在破败无人的街道上，抵达了位于一个小型购物中心内的大型电子商店。我略带疑惑地扬起眉毛，在店门前驻足。“这里面藏着什么？”

"Lots of stuff," she answers flippantly, climbing to the ground. "I told you you'd see. Come on."
她轻描淡写地回答：'东西多着呢，'边说边爬到地上，'我早说过你会看到的，快来吧。'

Muttering, I obey, flipping my flashlight on as I follow her into the dark warehouse-sized space. She trots along the main aisles as though she knows exactly where she's going, and shortly she angles into the audio section.
我低声自语，却还是顺从地打开手电筒，跟随她踏入那片昏暗的仓库空间。她沿着主通道轻快前行，似乎对路线一清二楚，很快便转向了音响区域。

When I see what she's inspecting, I scratch doubtfully at my head. "You want a stereo?"
看到她在查看的东西，我困惑地挠了挠头。“你是想要个立体声音响吗？”

"Yeah." Chewing a lip, she examines one box, then visibly dismisses it and moves onto the next. "It's so quiet up there all the time. I want something just... loud and stupid, for once."
嗯。"她咬着唇，打量着一个盒子，随即明显地将其排除，转向下一个。"上面总是静悄悄的。我就想找点儿...简单粗暴又傻气的东西，就这一次。

I can't help but smile. "Isn't that us? You're loud and I'm stupid?"
我不禁笑了出来。"这不正是我们吗？你吵吵嚷嚷，我傻乎乎的。"

She pauses, regarding me narrowly as though she can't figure out whether she should be offended or not. Eventually she just shrugs. "Yeah, but I mean in a different way. Don't worry; you'll like it."
她顿了顿，目光锐利地打量着我，仿佛在权衡是否该感到不悦。最后她只是耸了耸肩。“嗯，我是说另一种方式。别担心，你会喜欢的。”

"I'd better," I mutter. "Otherwise you owe me."
我还是做吧，"我低声说。"不然你就欠我一个人情了。

Her lips quirk, but she doesn't glance away from the shelf. "I'm sure you'd find some way to make that worthwhile too."
她嘴角微扬，目光却依旧停留在货架上，说道：“我敢肯定，你总有办法让那也变得有意义。”

I chuckle. "Maybe." 我笑了笑：“可能吧。”

Shortly she settles on one whole boxed stereo, the biggest one in stock by the looks. "Okay, this should work." Blue eyes dart up to meet mine in the dimness. "You can carry this while I pick out some music."
很快，她决定拿一套完整的盒装音响，看样子是库存里最大的。"行，这个应该合适。" 她的蓝眼睛在暗淡的光线中望向我。"你拿着这个，我去选些音乐。"

Grimacing, I shuffle forward to swap the flashlight for the stereo box. Not only is the thing heavy, but also unwieldy due to its size. "I'm surprised you're getting a packaged thing," I admit, "rather than just pick out the biggest components separately." Crap. I probably shouldn't have given her that idea.
我皱着眉，艰难地向前挪动，用闪光灯换取那个笨重的音响箱。这东西不仅沉甸甸的，还因为体积大而显得格外笨拙。“真没想到你会买整套的，”我坦白说，“我还以为你会单独挑选最大的组件呢。”哎呀，我可能不该提这个建议。

She shrugs, leaving me alone to head towards the music selection. "I thought about it, but it would be annoying to set it all up like that at the campsite. This should suffice. Come on."
她耸耸肩，独自走向音乐选择区，留下我一人。“我考虑过，但在营地那样布置太麻烦了。这样就够了，走吧。”

Shaking my head, I follow her to the music, where she starts grabbing stuff seemingly at random, but it's all pop-chart stuff. "Asuka... this is all girly pop."
我摇头跟随着她，她开始在音乐区随手抓取，看似随意，实则都是流行榜单上的热门歌曲。"Asuka...这些都是些少女流行曲。"

"Yeah? You want to suggest something manlier? Be my guest." She snorts, tucking a few more jewel cases under her arm. "I don't think blasting some Bach adagio out over the world is going to be quite the same, Shinji."
哦？你想推荐更爷们儿的东西？请随意。"她嗤之以鼻，又往腋下塞了几个珠宝盒。"我觉得把巴赫的柔板放给全世界听，效果可不一样，真嗣。

"That's not at all what I would have picked," I protest. An adagio? Really. I like his cello suites better anyway.
"这完全不是我的选择，"我反驳道。一首柔板？真是出乎意料。相比之下，我更偏爱他的大提琴组曲。

She snorts. "Right. This is going to be a party, so there will be no classical, unless it has cannon shots or something."
她嗤笑道：“行吧。既然是派对，那就别放古典音乐了，除非是那种带炮声的。”

"Fine." I adjust my grip on the stereo box. "Get something by that... uh, the guy. With the dragon tattoo."
行。" 我调整了握着音响盒的姿势。"拿点那个...呃，那个有龙纹身的家伙的作品。

Sapphire eyes slide to regard me blankly. "Shinji, I have no idea who you're talking about."
她那蓝宝石般的眼睛无动于衷地转向我，"真嗣，我真不知道你在说谁。"

"Oh, whatever. Just get your stuff."
哎，随便你。快去收拾你的东西吧。

When we finally get back out to the truck, the stereo and music collectively can barely fit inside. I give Asuka a silent but meaningful look on seeing this, but she just sticks her tongue out at me.
当我们终于回到卡车边，立体声音响和音乐几乎塞不进车内。我向明日香投去一个意味深长的沉默眼神，她却俏皮地对我吐了吐舌头。

Once again the way back up Irie Road is largely quiet. I speak only once, as curiosity strikes me. "Why a party?"
再次踏上 Irie 路归途，四周依旧静谧。我因好奇心驱使，只问了一句：“为何要举办派对？”

"We're alive," comes her bored response.
"我们活着，" 她无精打采地回应。

"We've been alive for weeks."
我们已存活数周。

"Yeah, but now I'm happy about it."
没错，不过现在我为此感到开心。

I nod and choose not to answer. Our drive up the hill continues in silence.
我点头示意，却未作答。我们继续在沉默中驱车攀上山坡。

When we get to the camp -- or get home -- Asuka seems to decide that all the stuff in the truck needs to come out. Including the generator. Thus, while she busies herself pulling random devices out and tossing them aside, I climb on top of the Humvee and start untying the shelf from the SAM unit. Idly I wonder how much gas we would have saved if I'd taken it off before we left in the morning.
抵达营地或回家后，明日香似乎决定要把卡车上的所有物品都卸下来，连发电机也不例外。她忙着将各种设备拖出并随手丢弃，而我则爬上悍马车顶，着手解开固定在萨姆导弹发射装置上的架子。我不禁思索，若早上出发前就卸下它，我们能节省多少汽油呢。

All too soon it's time to move the metal beast in the back. With just me holding the handles behind it, and Asuka watching me, I ease the thing down the ramp. Or, more accurately, I let it roll down and skid clumsily after it, then almost pitch forward when it gets stuck in the mud at the bottom. At least it was easier than getting it up.
转眼间，就该移动后方的金属巨兽了。我独自握着把手在后面推，明日香在一旁注视着我，我小心翼翼地让它沿着斜坡下滑。实际上，我是让它自己滚下去，然后笨拙地跟在后面滑行，当它卡在底部的泥泞中时，我差点儿失去平衡。不过，这比把它弄上去要轻松多了。

However, moving it across the damp ground proves to be another matter. It's heavy enough that the wheels simply sink in, and we have to drag it through the mud anyway, pausing to jump the occasional tree root.
然而，将它拖过湿润的土地却颇具挑战。它沉重到轮子深陷泥中，我们只能费力地拖行，途中还得不时跳过突起的树根。

On reaching the edge of our clearing, I stop and simply lean against the generator. "We're doing all this," I mutter, "so you can have a party?"
当我走到空地边缘，便停下靠在发电机旁。“我们费这么大劲，”我低声说，“就为了给你办个派对？”

She nods, leaning her elbows on the handles. "You need to lighten up too, Shinji. Don't complain."
她点头，手肘搁在把手上。“真嗣，你也得放松点，别再抱怨了。”

I shrug. Maybe she's right. "Is here good enough, or do we need to move it more?"
我耸耸肩，或许她说的没错。“这里行吗，还是要再挪一下？”

"This should be fine," she decides, pushing herself upright to frown at the thing. "I'm going to start putting stuff together."
看来应该没问题，"她一边想着，一边坐直身体，皱着眉头盯着那东西。"我得开始组装了。

"I'm going to wash up," I counter. With the clouds breaking up, I don't think it's going to rain again anytime soon.
"我正要去洗漱，"我回应说。云层正在散开，我想短时间内应该不会再下雨了。

Asuka doesn't even answer; it looks like she's already in her own world, putting some improbable device together in her head. Smiling, I leave her there, then grab the cleaning stuff and a change of clothes on my way to what I've started thinking of as the bathroom. Once there I strip down and wash off, spending some time and water on my hair to get rid of the caked LCL in it. If it's this much of a pain for me, I can only imagine how Asuka does it. Maybe she has secret girl hair skills I don't know about.
明日香连回应都没有；她似乎已沉浸在自己的世界中，脑海里正拼装着某种奇异的装置。我微笑着离开她，拿起清洁用品和换洗衣物，前往我已开始称之为浴室的地方。到了那里，我脱掉衣物，仔细清洗身体，尤其花了些时间和水来清除头发上干结的 LCL。如果对我来说都如此费劲，真不敢想象明日香是如何应对的。或许她掌握了我所不知的女生洗发秘技。

When I get back, she's already set up the stereo on top of a few cases of water, and has moved on to cutting something apart, something that, judging by the box, is for fish tanks. I don't really know. When I ask what she's doing, and if I can help, she just mutters something indistinct in response.
我回来时，她已将音响安置在几箱水上，正着手拆解某物，看那盒子，像是鱼缸配件。我不甚明了。询问她在忙什么，是否需要协助，她却含糊其辞，未作明确回答。

Shrugging, I back off a short distance and sit on the log to watch her. I don't think she really knows what she's doing, and she has only slightly more mechanical skill than I do, apparently, but in a couple of hours she's managed to cannibalize a couple of different machines to put together a pump connected to a few tubes. After dumping some gas into the generator and flicking it on -- surprisingly it's only about as loud as a vacuum cleaner -- she hooks her device up and successfully starts pumping water out of one plastic bottle and into another.
我耸耸肩，稍稍后退，坐在一根圆木上观察她。她似乎并不清楚自己的所作所为，机械技能也仅比我略胜一筹。然而，几个小时过去，她已巧妙地拆解了几台机器，拼凑出一个带管的泵。她向发电机注入汽油，启动时——意外地，噪音仅与吸尘器相当——随即连接装置，顺利地将水从一个塑料瓶抽至另一个。

With a grin she sits back, then after a moment turns off the generator. "Hey, Shinji," she calls, turning around, but then she pauses, eyes darting over to where I'm sitting. "When did you change? And clean?"
她面带微笑地坐下，不一会儿便关掉了发电机。“嘿，真嗣，”她转头喊道，但突然停住，目光转向我坐的位置。“你什么时候换的衣服？还这么整洁？”

"About five minutes after we got here," I answer. "You didn't notice."
我们到这里大约五分钟后，"我回答道，"你没注意到。

"Oh." With a toss of her head, she gestures at the thing she's built. "This is probably too small for us to get any real use out of, but I wanted to make sure the parts would work together. All I need is a thing to boil water and a tank to collect the condensed steam, and we've got a desalination plant on our hands. Oh, and we'd need something to clean out the gunk left over after boiling."
"哦。" 她一甩头，示意她所建造的装置。"这或许对我们来说太小，难以发挥实际作用，但我主要是想验证这些部件能否配合使用。我只需一个烧水的设备和一个收集冷凝蒸汽的容器，就能搭建起一个海水淡化厂。对了，还得有个清理煮沸后残留杂质的工具。

"That's cool," I smile. Moving the entire apparatus to a source of water, on the other hand, is not going to be cool, but the benefits are good enough to make it worthwhile. "I didn't really know you liked to work with your hands."
这挺酷的，"我笑着说。不过，把整个设备搬到水源那边可不轻松，但考虑到带来的好处，还是值得的。"真没想到你这么喜欢亲自动手。

"I don't," she mutters, standing and stretching her legs out. "It's so much slower and messier than what's in my head. I don't have any real skill in it, just persistence."
我做不到，"她喃喃自语，起身舒展双腿。"这比脑海中的设想慢且杂乱。我并无此项真才实学，唯有坚持罢了。

"Still," I note, "that's pretty useful. The world needs stuff like that now."
我仍然认为，'这确实很有用。现在世界正需要这类东西。'

She smiles slightly at this. "Maybe." For a moment she studies me while her smile fades. "Anyway, start cooking, jerk. It'll be dark soon, and then we'll party."
她对此微微一笑，说：“或许吧。”她微笑着端详了我片刻，笑容逐渐淡去。“好了，赶紧做饭吧，天快黑了，我们还要开派对呢。”

Great. I nod, pushing myself up from the log, and start finding wood and paper for a fire. The propane heater is just about out of fuel, so tonight I'll be using actual fire for boiling stuff. Makes more sense to me, really.
很好。我点头，从圆木上站起身，开始搜集木柴和纸张准备生火。丙烷加热器的燃料快用完了，今晚我得用真火来烧水。这样对我来说，确实更合理。

I can feel Asuka's eyes on me, but shortly she starts putting stuff away, cleaning up the mess she made. I put her out of my mind.
我能察觉到明日香的目光，不过她很快便开始整理物品，收拾自己弄乱的场面。我让自己不去想她。

Soon she summons my attention, however. "Hey, Shinji."
很快，她就唤起了我的注意。"嘿，真嗣。"

I glance up, quickly spotting her at the edge of the trees, carrying an armful of cleaning stuff and with a towel draped over her shoulder. "Yeah?"
我抬头望去，一眼便在树丛旁看到了她，怀里满是清洁工具，肩上还搭着毛巾。“什么事？”

"I'm going to go wash and change." Blue eyes meet my own directly, confidently, for a long moment before she spins and disappears into the trees.
"我准备去洗漱换衣服。"她的蓝眼睛直勾勾地与我对视，自信而坚定，片刻后便转身隐入林间。

My heart starts pounding as I stare after her. Was that... that was an invitation, wasn't it? No way. I'm more or less okay touching her in safe places, but there's no way in hell I'm walking in there on her bathing without a crystal-clear invitation. Which... potentially... I could get, if I asked for it. Eventually.
凝视着她的背影，我的心跳加速。那是个邀请吧？不可能。我顶多在安全范围内触碰她，但绝不会在她沐浴时贸然进入，除非有明确的邀请。或许，如果我开口询问，最终能得到这样的机会。

Wow. Yeah. Not today, though.
哇，确实。但今天不行。

Shaking my head briskly, I return to the task of fire-building. About all that's left now is to light the thing, which I do, using Asuka's lighter -- trust her to find a BMW one somewhere -- since mine has run out. Then I sit back and watch, making sure the wind doesn't smother it.
我用力摇了摇头，继续着手头的生火任务。眼下只需点燃火堆，我便用了明日香的打火机——她总能神奇地找到宝马牌的——因为我的已经没油了。随后我坐下，仔细看护，以防风将火苗吹熄。

She was probably just teasing me. She had to know I wouldn't take her up on it, and was just doing that to put the suggestion in my head. If I actually had followed her, I bet she'd have been surprised and a little uncomfortable. If I didn't just get kicked in the crotch outright. Hell, it's just in the last day or two we've been able to hold hands, even.
她大概只是在逗我玩。她肯定清楚我不会当真，只是想在我心里种下这个念头。如果我真的跟了上去，我猜她会感到意外，甚至有些尴尬。除非我直接被她一脚踢中要害。说到底，我们也就是这一两天才开始能牵手的。

In any case, though, that look is going to be staying in my head for a few days. And I suppose at the very least it means I'm allowed to flirt back at her a little more openly. If I knew how to.
不管怎样，那眼神注定会在我脑海里徘徊数日。至少，这似乎给了我更公开地回应她调情的许可。如果我懂得如何调情的话。

Eventually she makes it back to the campsite. She's clean, of course, and has changed into a shirt I haven't seen before, one that's black and grey and exposes a little belly. Nice. She must be feeling better about the birthmarks, then.
最终她返回了营地。她当然已经梳洗干净，换上了一件我未曾见过的衬衫，黑灰色调，恰到好处地露出一点腹部。挺不错的。看来她对那些胎记的态度有所改善了。

After nodding to my answering smile, she shuffles over towards where I'm kneeling. Shortly she's directly behind me, her knees actually touching my back. "What's cooking?" The faint smell of soap from her counters the ever-present odor of smoke near the fire.
我微笑回应后，她拖着脚步向我跪着的地方靠近。很快，她就站在我身后，膝盖轻轻触碰到我的背。“在煮什么好吃的？”她身上那股淡淡的肥皂香，与火堆旁的烟味交织在一起。

"Linguine alfredo." The sauce came from a powder, so it's going to suck, but she probably won't care. Or maybe even notice.
奶油白酱意大利扁面条。酱汁源自粉末，味道估计不佳，但她或许并不介意，甚至可能未曾察觉。

"Cool." Fingers thread into my hair, then ruffle it playfully, actually swaying my head slowly back and forth. "Good Shinji."
真酷。" 手指伸进我的发间，轻柔地拨弄着，还带着几分俏皮地让我的头缓缓左右摇摆。"干得好，真嗣。

"You wanna cook?" Twisting, I offer up the chopstick I've been using to stir the noodles. "I don't have to, and I'd be happy to go read or something while you finish this off."
你想做饭吗？" 我侧身递出一直在搅拌面条的筷子。"我并非必须做，我乐意去读会儿书或做点别的，你慢慢来。

"No, you're good at it." Giving my head one last shake, she steps over to her bin of clothes and starts rooting around.
"不，你做得挺好的。"她最后摇了摇头，便走到自己的衣物箱前，开始翻找起来。

Frowning, I push my hair back into place. "Such a brat."
皱眉间，我整理了一下头发，嘟囔道："真是个调皮鬼。"

"What?" 什么？

"What?" I don't even look at her as I give the noodles another stir.
"什么？" 我连看都没看她，继续搅动着面条。

"I thought you said something."
我还以为你说了什么呢。

I shrug, sitting back on the log again. After a moment she loses interest in the conversation, then goes back to her clothes. I smile.
我耸了耸肩，重新坐回那根原木上。不久，她对谈话不再感兴趣，便回去整理衣物。我微微一笑。

Shortly she plops down beside me on the log and starts to brush her hair. She doesn't say anything, just watches the fire while I finish cooking, and when I start draining the noodles she puts the brush away. Her hair, without whatever stuff she would normally put in it, is a little frizzy as it dries.
没过多久，她便在我身旁的圆木上坐下，开始梳理头发。她沉默不语，只是静静地望着火堆，而我则继续烹饪。当我开始将面条沥干时，她便收起了梳子。她的头发，少了平日里的那些定型产品，随着干燥显得略微蓬松。

Conversation remains absent while we eat, and I don't really mind. The silence is comfortable now.
吃饭时没有交谈，我并不介意。这种沉默现在让人感到舒适。

Afterwards, while she cleans, I make my way over to where the generator and stereo sit. Despite my earlier objections to her taste in music, I don't really mind this stuff; it'll be nice to have something to listen to. I just hope she doesn't think I'm going to dance.
她打扫时，我走向放着发电机和音响的角落。虽然之前我对她的音乐品味有所微词，但这些音乐我并不反感；有音乐相伴挺不错。只愿她别以为我会随之起舞。

Before long footsteps approach behind me and slim arms slip around my waist. "Hey," she purrs into my ear.
很快，我身后响起了脚步声，一双纤细的手臂悄悄环住了我的腰。"嘿，"她在我耳畔柔声说道。

I smile at the ground, reaching awkwardly behind myself to press the small of her back into me. She lets me do so, melting into me. "Hi."
我对着地面微笑，不自然地伸手到背后，轻轻将她的腰背推向我。她顺从地依偎过来，与我紧密相依。“嗨。”

"This will be the world's first party after Third Impact," she murmurs. "Are you ready to make history?"
这将是第三次冲击后全球首次聚会，"她轻声说道，"你准备好书写历史了吗？

I chuckle at this, turning around in her arms; she continues to hold me, staring into my eyes from just centimeters away. "I think if history remembers us," I point out, "it won't be for this."
我忍不住笑了出来，在她的怀抱里转了个身；她依旧紧紧抱着我，从极近的距离凝视着我的双眼。“我觉得，如果历史会记住我们，”我提醒道，“绝不会是因为这一刻。”

She laughs, letting go of me and stepping around to the generator. "That's probably true."
她笑出声，松开我，绕到发电机那边。“这话多半没错。”

"And a party of two is usually called something else," I continue, frowning; I was sort of hoping for a kiss there, when she was so close.
"通常，两个人的聚会另有称呼，"我皱眉继续说；她靠得那么近时，我心里其实期待着一个吻。

"Yeah?" As she flips the generator on, she's forced to speak more loudly over it. "Like what?"
真的吗？" 她启动发电机，声音不得不提高。"比如说？

I wait until she's meeting my gaze, then smile uncomfortably, hoping I'm not totally making this up. "A couple."
我等到她目光与我交汇，便尴尬地笑了笑，暗自希望这不是我凭空捏造的。“一对。”

She smiles back at me, and for once it's not teasing or sly; it's just a smile. "Yeah. You have a point there." Before I can reply, she twists back around and starts pushing buttons on the stereo.
她回眸一笑，这次没有丝毫戏谑或狡黠，只是纯粹的微笑。“确实，你说的有道理。”我尚未开口，她已转回身，开始在音响上按动按钮。

Shortly the first song begins, something lively but barely loud enough to compete with the generator. Asuka changes this quickly, twisting the volume until just before my ears start to hurt. "There," she shouts, nodding her approval. "Sound good?"
不久，第一首歌曲响起，节奏轻快但音量偏低，几乎被发电机的轰鸣声淹没。明日香迅速调高音量，直到接近我耳朵的承受极限。“行了，”她大声确认，点头表示认可。“这样听着不错吧？”

"Are you deaf?" I yell back, covering my ears. "This is way too loud!"
你听不见吗？" 我大声回喊，捂着耳朵。"这声音太吵了！

"We're not going to be standing next to the speakers, dolt," she counters, grabbing my wrist and pulling me a short distance away. "We'll be over here. Dancing."
傻瓜，我们不会站在扬声器旁边，"她反驳着，一把抓住我的手腕，将我拉到稍远的地方。"我们要在这里跳舞。

Fortunately, with no walls to contain the sound, the volume drops off noticeably just five meters away; it's still loud, but comfortable. "Look, I... don't really know how to dance."
幸好，四周无墙，声音传播五米后便显著降低；虽仍响亮，却已不觉刺耳。“你看，我……其实不太懂跳舞。”

"You think I care?" she grins. "Even if you did, I'd still be better than you." Grabbing my wrists, she starts dancing, pulling me off-balance, making me move.
"你以为我在意吗？" 她笑着说，"即便你在意，我也比你更胜一筹。" 她紧握我的手腕，开始舞动，拽得我步履蹒跚，不得不随之起舞。

I don't recognize the song, but it's sparkly and silly, and her enthusiasm is infectious. I'm sure she doesn't really know how to dance either, but she still looks better at it than I am, or maybe she's just more graceful, a word I've never really thought to apply to her before this. Somehow the endearing innocence of the music and her continuing teasing get me to move, and I start to dance as well, mostly just hopping lamely up and down in place. She doesn't seem to care, though; at the sight, she claps hands in front of her chest and throws her head back in laughter, but not the mocking kind.
我不熟悉这首歌，但它既闪亮又俏皮，她的热情极具感染力。我敢肯定她其实也不太懂跳舞，可她看起来就是比我跳得好看，或许她只是更优雅，这个词我以前从未想过用来形容她。不知为何，音乐中那份令人喜爱的纯真和她持续的挑逗让我也动了起来，开始笨拙地在原地蹦跳。她似乎并不介意；看到这一幕，她双手在胸前拍掌，仰头大笑，却并非嘲讽之意。

Next to a fire throwing the occasional spark into the air, and under a violet sky dusted lightly with stars, we dance. We celebrate that we're alive, that we're happy, that we exist at all and that we're together. We shout to fill the empty world, to challenge the reign of silence that doesn't have to be there anymore. We exist, and we dance, and we love.
在篝火旁，火星不时跃入夜空，紫罗兰色的天幕上星光点点，我们随之起舞。我们欢庆生命的鲜活，欢庆内心的喜悦，欢庆我们能够相聚，共同存在。我们放声高呼，打破世界的空旷，挑战那不再必要的沉默统治。我们在此，我们舞动，我们相爱。

When the fire finally burns low and the music starts to repeat, Asuka pauses to turn off the electronics, and together we stumble into the tent. Faint filtered moonlight guides us to the blankets and we crawl under them, both of us still giggling, to create a cocoon of warmth in an otherwise inhospitable world. With my arms around her, and her back snuggled tightly up to my chest, we share the pillow and wait to slip together into our dreams.
当篝火渐熄，音乐循环播放时，明日香停下手中的动作，关闭了电子设备。我们一同蹒跚地进入帐篷。透过帐篷的微弱月光指引我们找到毯子，我们钻进去，两人依旧咯咯笑着，在一个本不友好的世界里营造出温暖的茧。我环抱着她，她的背紧贴着我的胸膛，我们共用一个枕头，静静等待着一同沉入梦乡。

Author's notes: Aaaaand done. I'm actually fairly happy with how this one turned out. In retrospect, I should maybe cut out some parts where it moves a little slowly for my tastes, but I doubt I'll change it now.
作者笔记：终于完成了。这次的结果我颇为满意。回顾起来，或许应该删去一些进展稍慢的部分，但估计现在也不会去改动了。

Anyway, I just think it's funny that I wrote an almost-70k-word M-rated romance and they didn't even kiss. Ha! Hahahaahaa... ahhh, good times. In all seriousness, though, I didn't do that to be a jerk. To me the story was about achieving emotional, rather than physical intimacy (despite the sexual tension). If you're one of these two, you just can't take anything for granted, not civil conversation, not innocent human contact, not being able to stay in the same place, maybe not even the other person trying to save your life when you need it. As such, I thought leaping into that level of physical relationship would be a little too much, too fast. Sometimes less is more.
不管怎样，我觉得挺有意思的，我写了一部近 7 万字的成人级爱情小说，男女主角竟然连吻都没接过。哈哈哈哈……哎，真是美好的回忆。不过说正经的，我并非有意为之。在我看来，这个故事探讨的是情感而非肉体的亲密（尽管充满了性张力）。如果你是故事中的任何一方，你会发现没有什么是理所当然的，无论是礼貌的交谈，还是单纯的身体接触，甚至是能否共处一地，甚至包括对方在你危难时刻伸出援手。因此，我认为贸然进入那种身体关系未免过于仓促。有时候，简约反而更显深意。

Serious and heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who's read and reviewed thus far. I appreciate people pointing out weaknesses in the story as much as I like hearing what people liked; it's as important to know what doesn't work as it is to know what does. Some things, I couldn't do much about, given the premise and setting, but for other comments I changed what I could to improve things. KuMardagg: you are correct (though I didn't think about it explicitly until you pointed it out). I think Asuka has more barriers to relationship-forming than Shinji does, and he's probably more willing to overlook stuff that pisses him off as long as she's good company on the whole, so most of the smoke-clearing was for her benefit. Anonymous: yeah, I agree that I probably should've mentioned the past and other characters more. I had a few references here and there and probably should have had more, but I couldn't find many places to fit them in without making it sound clumsy. Apologies. Glad I could make you like Asuka, though. :) Everyone else (since I'm starting to ramble): you guys know who you are, and you rock. All of you. Thank you.
衷心感谢每一位阅读并评论至此的朋友。我既珍视大家指出故事中的不足，也乐于听到大家喜欢的部分；了解哪些地方不奏效与了解哪些地方奏效同样重要。有些问题，鉴于故事前提和背景，我无法做出太多改变，但对于其他建议，我已尽力改进。KuMardagg：您说得对（虽然我之前并未明确意识到这一点，直到您指出）。我认为，与真嗣相比，明日香在建立关系方面面临更多障碍，而他可能更愿意忽略那些惹恼他的事情，只要她总体上是好伙伴，所以大部分的澄清主要是为了她。 匿名者：确实，我应该更多地提及过去和其他角色。虽然我在文中零星提到了一些，但本可以更充分地展开。遗憾的是，我难以在不破坏行文流畅的情况下插入更多相关内容。对此我表示歉意。很高兴能让你喜欢上明日香。:) 至于其他人（我可能有点扯远了）：你们自己清楚，你们都很出色。感谢大家。

Okay, that's all, I promise. Until next time.
好的，就这些，我保证。下次见。

### Chapter 16 Epilogue: Itoshiki-Mono Yo
后记：爱惜之物啊

"God damn it, Shinji. Why can't you hold one simple object in one simple place?"
该死的，真嗣。为什么你就不能在一个简单的地方拿住一个简单的物体呢？

The idiot gives his baseball cap an angry tug, pulling it almost low enough to conceal his sunglasses, and glares at me. In the harsh afternoon sunlight, he's sweated through most of his t-shirt, and the red water we're standing in has soaked his jeans thoroughly. "You really want an answer, or are you just asking because you're mad?" In the shallows next to his legs is a shiny length of metal ventwork, half-submerged.
那傻瓜气愤地猛拉了一下自己的棒球帽，几乎要将它拉得低到遮住太阳镜，然后狠狠地瞪着我。在午后刺眼的阳光下，他已是大汗淋漓，T 恤湿透了大半，而我们站立的这片红色水域也彻底浸湿了他的牛仔裤。"你是真想知道答案，还是只是因为生气才问的？"在他腿旁的浅水中，有一截闪亮的金属通风管道半浸在水中。

What a dick. Folding arms over my chest, I glare right back at him. "I want an answer, smartass."
真是个混蛋。我双臂交叉在胸前，毫不示弱地回瞪他。"我当然想要答案，自作聪明的家伙。"

"It's sunny out," he answers tightly, pointing one finger at the sun above. "And that thing," he adds, shifting to point at the tube, "is made out of metal. It feels like it just came out of an oven. So it hurts my hands and makes them sweat, and then when I try to shift my grip on it, it slips and falls because it's heavy and you want it pointed at this stupid angle."
外面阳光明媚，"他紧绷着回答，用一根手指指向头顶的太阳。"而那东西，"他接着说，转而指向那根管子，"是金属做的。感觉就像刚从烤箱里拿出来一样。所以它烫伤了我的手，还让手心出汗，当我试图调整握持时，它就滑落了，因为它很重，而且你还要它以这种愚蠢的角度对准。

"Oooh, how very plausible," I acknowledge, lifting a cool eyebrow. God, he's probably right. I didn't think of that. We're trying to connect the tube to a boxy makeshift boiler we dragged into the water here. It's supposed to carry steam to a condensing chamber, which is in fact just an oversized hard-plastic cooler. One of these days I'll rig something up to make it cool in there instead of room temperature, but it'll still sort of work this way. Enough to get us clean water.
"哦，听起来挺合理的，"我承认道，扬起一道冷静的眉毛。天哪，他可能说得对。我没想到这一点。我们正试图将管子连接到一个方方正正的临时锅炉上，那是我们拖到水里的。它本应将蒸汽输送到一个冷凝室，实际上只是一个超大号的硬塑料冷却箱。总有一天我会设法让它在里面降温，而不是室温，但这样也差不多能用。足以让我们得到干净的水。

His face darkens further as ruby waves lap against our thighs. "Well, maybe you want to hold it up instead, if you don't believe me."
他的脸色更加阴沉，红宝石般的波浪拍打着我们的双腿。"好吧，如果你不相信我，也许你想自己举着它。"

I laugh at this. "And trust you with the soldering iron? No fucking way."
我对此嗤之以鼻。"然后让你拿着焊枪？门儿都没有。"

"You don't trust me to hold up the vent thing either," he sighs, "so what's the point? Maybe I should just let you do this yourself." Giving his head a shake, he turns and wades away, back towards our supplies on the beach forty meters away.
"看来你也不相信我能扶稳那个通风口，"他叹了口气，"那还有什么意义呢？或许我应该让你自己来。"他摇了摇头，转身涉水离去，朝着四十米外海滩上我们的补给品走去。

I stare after him for a time, then grimace and set the soldering iron back on the second generator we grabbed yesterday. Finding a waterproof one was a bitch. Above, seagulls circle and drift along with the wind, crying their stupid shrill cries. I don't even know when they started showing back up -- we haven't been by the water much until just recently -- but I was glad to see them. Now they just annoy me, though. They don't fucking shut up, and they shit on everything.
我盯着他的背影看了一会儿，然后皱眉，把烙铁放回昨天我们拿到的第二台发电机上。找到一个防水的真是费劲。头顶上，海鸥随着风盘旋，发出刺耳的叫声。我甚至不知道它们是什么时候回来的——直到最近我们都没怎么靠近水边——但看到它们我还是挺高兴的。现在它们只是让我心烦，它们吵个不停，还到处拉屎。

"Shinji," I call halfheartedly, "wait." He doesn't wait, though, since he's almost back to the shore already, and he doesn't stop or turn around either. With a shake of my head I start slogging after him, making a face at the thick scents of salt and blood. Insistent sea breeze tugs at my hair and shirt as I move, but the shirt doesn't move much since it's almost as wet as my jeans. I can't wait to finish this and clean up.
"真嗣，"我半心半意地喊道，"等等。"但他并没有等，因为他已经快回到岸边了，也没有停下来或回头。我摇了摇头，开始艰难地跟在他后面，对浓烈的盐味和血腥味皱起了眉头。执拗的海风拉扯着我的头发和衬衫，但衬衫几乎和我的牛仔裤一样湿，所以没怎么动。我迫不及待想完成这一切，然后好好清洗一番。

When Shinji reaches the beach he drops to sit next to the little picnic basket we brought along, then pulls his hat off and runs a hand through his hair. I reach him in moments and collapse at his side. Today hasn't been a good day.
当真嗣来到海滩时，他一屁股坐在我们带来的小野餐篮旁，随后摘下帽子，用手捋了捋头发。我片刻便追上了他，瘫坐在他身旁。今天实在不是个好日子。

After a moment I swallow. "Shinji, it's... hot, and this is frustrating work, and I don't really like doing it either. I'm sorry."
过了一会儿，我咽了咽口水，说道：“真嗣，这天气……太热了，这活儿又让人心烦，其实我也不太想干。对不起。”

He waves a hand, then tugs off his sunglasses and squints out over the water. He actually has a faint but noticeable tan from wearing them, thin pale lines on either side of his face stretching from eye to temple. "Don't worry about it."
他摆了摆手，然后摘下太阳镜，眯着眼望向海面。他脸上确实因为戴眼镜而留下了一抹淡淡的晒痕，从眼睛到太阳穴两侧各有一道细长的苍白线条。“别放在心上。”

I nod, shifting my gaze back to the ocean, like him. Rei's distant stone face hasn't changed at all since I first saw it a month ago, but at least from this beach we can only see one of the petrified mass-produced Evas. Shinji wanted to make our setup at the beach where we first appeared, but I pointed out that if other people show up there too, I don't want them poking around with and maybe breaking the stuff we put so much effort into making. Not to mention the potential weirdness of awakening from something as bizarre as Third Impact to find something as mundane as an electrical generator chugging along nearby. So instead we're at another beach, closer to home and actually a little bigger and nicer than the other. Jagged stone bluffs rise out of the water to our right, decorated here and there with clingy little grasses and shrubs and such, while to our left the beach stretches for at least a half-kilometer of smooth sand.
我点了点头，目光再次转向大海，就像他一样。自从一个月前我第一次见到以来，零那遥远的石像面孔丝毫未变，但至少从这个海滩我们只能看到一尊石化的大量生产型 Eva。真嗣想在我们最初出现的地方的海滩上搭建营地，但我指出，如果有其他人也来到这里，我不想让他们四处摆弄，甚至可能破坏我们费尽心思制作的东西。更不用说从第三次冲击这样奇异的事件中醒来，却发现旁边有一个普通的电力发电机在运转，这种潜在的怪异感。因此，我们选择了另一个海滩，离家更近，实际上比之前的那个还要大一些，也更美。在我们的右边，参差不齐的石崖从水中升起，点缀着零星的草丛和灌木，而左边，海滩绵延至少半公里，是一片平滑的沙滩。

"We should eat something," mutters Shinji, reaching back for the picnic basket. "Some food would help my mood, at least. What do you want?"
我们该吃点东西了，"真嗣嘟囔着，伸手去拿野餐篮。"吃点东西至少能让我的心情好点。你想吃什么？

"Give me the trail mix, and some of that orange Jock-Ade or whatever it is." Another gust of wind pushes my hair around, bringing a little relief from the day's heat.
"把那什锦干果给我，还有那个橙色的 Jock-Ade，管它是什么呢。"又一阵风拂过我的发丝，带来一丝从日间酷热中解脱的凉意。

He complies without speaking, pausing to grab something for himself. In silence we crunch through the assorted snacks serving as today's lunch. Sunlight glitters on the waves ahead, dries the bloody water soaking my clothes.
他默不作声地照做了，顺手也给自己抓了点东西。我们默默地咀嚼着这些杂七杂八的零食，权当是今天的午餐。阳光在面前的波浪上闪烁，晒干了浸透我衣物的血水。

Once I'm done, I wipe my palms on my still-damp jeans and give my mouth a twist. Our equipment is still glittering sadly out in the water, waiting to be put together into a functioning machine. "Hey, let's just work at it for another hour or two, okay? There's no real rush, and we could just as easily do it on a cloudy day."
吃完后，我用手掌在仍湿漉漉的牛仔裤上擦了擦，撇了撇嘴。我们的装备还在水面上闪着凄凉的光，等待着被组装成一台能运转的机器。"嘿，我们再干一两个小时吧，好吗？其实也不急，阴天来做也一样。"

"Why didn't you just say that this morning?" he mutters around a mouthful of soy nuts.
"那你早上怎么不说呢？"他嘴里塞满大豆坚果，含糊地嘟囔着。

I shrug. "Because I didn't feel like it."
我耸了耸肩。"因为我不乐意。"

"Great. Okay." 很好。行吧。

Rolling my eyes, I down the last of my orange drink, then stand and stare down at Shinji. He blinks up at me without expression, glugging a drink from his own bottle. While he's watching, I unbutton and unzip my jeans.
我翻了个白眼，喝完了最后一口橙汁，然后站起来，俯视着真嗣。他面无表情地抬头看着我，从自己的瓶子里大口喝水。趁他看着，我解开并拉下牛仔裤的拉链。

Predictably, he chokes, spraying me with water. "A... Asuka! What the hell are you...?" He trails off, doubling over and coughing, but makes no move to stop me as I slide the waist of the garment down over my hips.
不出所料，他呛到了，喷了我一脸水。"阿...阿苏卡！你到底在...？"他话没说完，就弯腰咳嗽起来，但并没有阻止我继续将牛仔裤从臀部褪下。

After stepping out of the legs, I toss the jeans at him and he jerks to catch them. "Calm down, dork."
刚迈出裤腿，我就把牛仔裤朝他扔去，他急忙伸手接住。"冷静点，傻瓜。"

Still coughing, he wipes a tear from one eye and glares at me, then throws my pants carelessly aside. "What the hell was that for? At least you're wearing the swimsuit under those. I didn't think...."
他还在咳嗽，一边擦去眼角的泪水，一边瞪着我，然后随意地把我的裤子甩到一边。"你这是干嘛？还好你里面穿了泳衣。我没想到……"

I laugh at him as I start tugging my shirt off as well. "You really think I'd come down here to wade around in the water, and then not wear a swimsuit to do it? You've got a pretty high opinion of yourself if you think I'm going to walk around in my underwear for you, let alone naked."
我边笑边开始脱掉自己的衬衫。"你真以为我会来这里玩水，却不穿泳衣？如果你觉得我会为了你而只穿内衣甚至裸着走来走去，那你可真自视甚高。"

He catches my shirt when I throw it at him, then throws it right back at my face. "Why'd you wear clothes at all if you were just going to do this?"
我把衬衫扔给他，他接住后又直接扔回我脸上。"既然你打算这样，干嘛还要穿衣服？"

"I didn't want to get sunburned, genius. Plus the jeans protected me from scratches and stuff when we were moving all the junk off the truck and into the water. And I knew your reaction would be funny." The pants were ruined well before this anyway, worn, torn and mud-stained.
"我可不想晒伤，天才。再说，牛仔裤还能保护我不被刮伤，搬那些破烂从卡车卸到水里时挺管用的。而且我知道你会有什么反应，肯定很有趣。"其实那条裤子早就破烂不堪了，磨损、撕裂、沾满泥渍。

He shakes his head at this, then starts counting points on his fingers. "Okay, first of all, that swimsuit is actually more revealing than just your underwear. I used to wash that stuff for you, remember? I know what it looks like. Not that it... well, anyway. Second... you're going to burn anyway if you stay like that now. You're really pale, and with the birthmarks I'm not sure how they'll...."
他对此摇了摇头，然后开始掰着手指头数落起来。"好吧，首先，那件泳衣其实比你的内裤还要暴露。我以前帮你洗过那些东西，记得吗？我知道它们什么样。倒不是说……呃，算了。其次……你现在这样待着，迟早会晒伤的。你皮肤这么白，加上那些胎记，我真不确定会怎样……"

"Fuck you very much, Shinji." Planting hands on my hips, I fix him with a cold glare. "Then it can be your job to stop me when you think I'm in danger of burning, since I won't think of it."
非常感谢你，真嗣。"我双手叉腰，冷冷地瞪着他。"既然如此，你觉得我有晒伤危险时，就由你来阻止我吧，反正我是不会想到的。

He blinks again, and his face slides from anger through caution and into thought. Cobalt-blue eyes roam my face for a moment before he nods. "That's... yeah, that's... fine."
他再次眨了眨眼，脸上的怒气逐渐转为谨慎，最后陷入沉思。那双钴蓝色的眼睛在我脸上游移片刻后，他点了点头。"那……行吧，那……可以。"

I nod as well, then turn and start striding back into the water. I suppose he wasn't expecting my retaliation to involve placing my comfort and safety in his hands. The rules are different now.
我也点了点头，随即转身，大步走回水中。我想他没料到我的反击会涉及到将自己的安危交到他手上。现在的规则已经不同了。

When I reach the setup we left out in the waves, he's wading after me. Grabbing the battery-powered soldering iron, I switch it back on, then wait while the tip heats up to a faintly-smoking readiness.
当我回到我们在波浪中留下的设备时，他正涉水跟在我后面。我抓起电池供电的焊铁，重新打开开关，然后等待焊头加热至微微冒烟的准备状态。

Shinji arrives shortly, then strips out of his shirt and uses it to grab the metal ductwork still lying in the water. A good idea, I suppose, and it does leave his top half bare for my inspection. He's not really well-built, to say the least, and he probably never will be, but what muscles he has are toned and quite visible under his skin, a benefit from the way we've been living since coming back. He has a nasty farmer's tan, though, sun-dark forearms shifting abruptly to a dorky pallor over the rest of his arms and chest.
真嗣不久也到了，他脱下衬衫，用它来抓住还泡在水中的金属风管。我想这是个不错的主意，而且这也让他的上半身裸露出来，供我审视。说实在的，他并不健壮，恐怕以后也不会，但他身上的肌肉线条分明，紧致可见，这是我们回来后生活方式的馈赠。不过，他有一个难看的农夫晒痕，前臂被太阳晒得黝黑，而手臂和胸部的其他部分则突兀地呈现出一种书呆子般的苍白。

Once he's ready with the tube, he stands there holding it and blinking at me... and it occurs to me that I'm just staring, checking him out. With a toss of my head I step aside, allowing him room to fit the duct onto the answering port I've made for it on the boiler side. Then, with iron in one hand and a wire of solder in the other, I set about trying to make two pieces of metal into one.
当他准备好管子，站在那里握着它，眨着眼看我时...我突然意识到自己正目不转睛地打量着他。我一甩头，侧身让开，给他腾出空间，以便将管道连接到我在锅炉侧制作的应答口上。接着，一手拿着铁片，一手捏着焊丝，我开始尝试将两块金属融为一体。

Two hours later the tube is attached and I'm messing around with the intake of the makeshift boiler, a rectangular metal hole a half-meter under the water's surface. It's annoying work since I can barely see what I'm doing, and I'm not totally sure any of it is going to work, but if it doesn't I suppose we can just try it all again. Eventually.
两小时后，管子终于接好了，我正摆弄着临时锅炉的进水口，那是一个位于水面下半米处的矩形金属孔。这活儿让人心烦，因为我几乎看不清自己在做什么，也不敢肯定这些措施是否有效，但如果不成功，我想我们大不了再试一次。迟早的事。

"Asuka." 明日香。

"Hmm?" After a little bit of re-shaping work, I'm grimacing as I try to fumble the intake back into place.
"嗯？"经过一番重新塑形的工作，我皱着眉头，努力摸索着将进水口复位。

"You're starting to burn, I think. We should go."
你开始晒伤了，我觉得。我们该走了。

I frown at Shinji, then at my upper body, which is indeed turning pinkish, at least where it's not already pink on account of the scars. After a moment I nod and turn back to the equipment. "Okay. Just let me get this thing in, then cover it all up, and we can...."
我皱眉看向真嗣，然后低头审视自己的上半身，确实开始泛起粉红色，至少那些未被疤痕覆盖的地方是如此。片刻后，我点了点头，转身继续整理设备。"好吧。等我把这东西装好，再把它盖起来，我们就可以……"

His hand grips my shoulder, gently but firmly. "No. It's time to go. No rush, remember?"
他的手轻轻但坚定地抓住我的肩膀。"不，是时候走了。别忘了，不急。"

Facing away from him, I smile at the water. Then I spin around and push his arm roughly away. "I don't know who the hell you think you are," I growl, wading past him and towards the shore, "telling me what to do, but it's a good thing for you I was ready to stop anyway. If I were a vindictive person I'd be thinking of a way to mess you up now."
背对着他，我对着水面微笑。随即我猛地转身，粗暴地推开他的手臂。"我不知道你以为自己是谁，"我咆哮着，涉水经过他向岸边走去，"指挥我做事，还好我本来就打算停手了。如果我是个记仇的人，现在就会想着怎么报复你了。"

Shinji pauses to reclaim his dripping-wet shirt from the water, then tags along with me, saying nothing. He's not impressed, of course, neither alarmed nor threatened. A little annoyed at me, maybe, but that should be pretty normal for him by now.
真嗣停下脚步，从水中捞起湿漉漉的衬衫，然后默默地跟在我后面。他当然没有被惊艳到，既不惊慌也不感到威胁。或许对我有点恼火，但对他来说，这应该已经习以为常了。

Once we reach the beach, I bend to retrieve our picnic basket and we continue on without a pause towards the truck. "Home?" I prompt, tugging open the passenger-side door and waiting while the sun-boiled heat inside the cab dissipates out into the surrounding air. "Or do you want to go somewhere else first?"
一到海滩，我弯腰拿起野餐篮，我们继续不间断地向卡车走去。“回家吗？”我问道，拉开副驾驶的车门，等待着车内被太阳烤得滚烫的热气散入周围的空气中。“还是你想先去别的地方？”

Shinji shrugs, then frowns out at the water again. "You want to go explore that ship that washed up under the bluffs?"
真嗣耸了耸肩，然后又皱眉望向水面。“你想去探索一下悬崖下冲上来的那艘船吗？”

I deliver a halfhearted punch to his stomach but he slaps my hand away before I can hit him. "I really doubt it's safe enough to explore, Shinji. And it's a commercial transport anyway; there's probably nothing in it but sparkplugs or cans of paint or something equally stupid."
我半真半假地朝他肚子上打了一拳，但他在我打到之前就把我的手拍开了。“我真的很怀疑那地方是否安全到可以探索，真嗣。而且那只是商用运输船；里面大概除了火花塞、油漆罐之类无聊的东西，什么也没有。”

He shrugs again, twisting seawater out of his shirt. "Then you want to throw rocks at it or something?"
他再次耸了耸肩，拧出衬衫里的海水。"那你是想扔石头砸它还是怎么的？"

"Sure." Without further ado I hop into the truck, then flinch at the feel of the hot seat on my bare back and thighs. The swimsuit doesn't exactly offer much protection.
"当然。"我二话不说跳上卡车，随即因裸露的背部和大腿感受到滚烫的座椅而一缩。这泳衣实在没多少防护作用。

Shinji climbs into his own seat, and then we're rumbling into motion. Despite all the running around we've done in the last few days, he still drives like a grandma.
真嗣也爬进自己的座位，接着我们便颠簸着上路了。尽管这几天我们四处奔波，他开车还是像个老奶奶似的。

After a quick jaunt to a residential district to shower -- a rare luxury now -- and change into clean clothes, we plow through a barbed-wire fence and onto a narrow private drive that'll take us near the ship. The vessel itself is a smallish one, of Chinese origin; I can't read the name but Shinji seems to think it's a place name, like "wooded ridge," or something, and that makes me laugh. In any case, it's maybe a hundred fifty meters long, it's slanting drunkenly in the rocky shallows, and our thrown rocks do absolutely no damage to it. It's fun, though.
匆匆前往住宅区洗了个澡——如今这可是难得的奢侈——并换上干净衣服后，我们撞开一道带刺铁丝网，驶上一条狭窄的私家车道，直奔那艘船而去。那船不大，来自中国；我看不懂船名，但真嗣觉得那是个地名，像是"林木茂盛的山脊"之类的，让我不禁笑出声。不管怎样，它大约一百五十米长，歪斜地搁浅在多石的浅滩上，我们扔的石头对它毫无损伤。不过，倒也挺好玩。

When we finally get back home it's almost dark; the sky is a clear star-dusted violet, crossed as always by the red ring of souls, though the moon won't be up for another few hours yet. Shinji cooks some packaged Italian stuff and I clean up afterwards. The whole meal takes less than a half-hour.
当我们终于回到家时，天色已近昏暗；天空是一片清澈的紫罗兰色，点缀着繁星，一如既往地横亘着那道红色的灵魂之环，尽管月亮还要过几个小时才会升起。真嗣煮了些包装好的意大利食品，而我则在饭后收拾。整个晚餐不到半小时就结束了。

Afterwards, I sprawl next to him on the ground, leaning back against the log, staring up at the glittering sky. My hip is pressed against his. "Hey, dork."
之后，我懒洋洋地躺在他旁边的地上，背靠着圆木，仰望着璀璨的星空。我的髋部紧贴着他的。“嘿，傻瓜。”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"I don't know why I even feel the need to ask this, but you've never had a girlfriend before, have you?" Ahead of us, the fire crackles away, warming my face.
“我不知道为什么我还要问这个，但你之前从没有过女朋友，对吧？”我们面前，篝火噼啪作响，温暖着我的脸庞。

He laughs out loud. "Me? Are you kidding?"
他放声大笑。“我？你在开玩笑吧？”

I laugh as well, but more quietly, and I stop first. "I just... you and Rei always seem like you had something going on."
我也笑了，只是更轻声些，我先停了下来。“我只是觉得……你和零总像是有那么点事儿。”

"Rei?" I'm not looking at his face, but his voice betrays clear confusion. "She... no, not really. I think she was more like a sister, or maybe a friend."
“零？”我没看他的脸，但他的声音明显透露出困惑。“她……不，也不算吧。我觉得她更像是个妹妹，或者朋友。”

I have my doubts about this, and the pressure of his hip against mine conveys a little tension despite his still-fading chuckles. He's lying, or not telling the whole truth. "Perv like you probably wanted more, though."
对此我心存疑虑，尽管他的笑声还在渐渐消散，但他紧贴我腰侧的髋部传递出些许紧张感。他在撒谎，或者没说全真相。“像你这样的色狼，八成是想要更多吧。”

He sighs. "I... don't know. Sometimes, maybe."
他叹了口气。“我……不知道。有时候，可能吧。”

So yes. Figures. With effort I clear a scowl from my face. Then I force a chuckle. "Of course, with the two of as socially inept as you were, I don't suppose there was anything to worry about."
确实如此。我费力地从脸上抹去皱眉，然后勉强笑了一声。“当然，考虑到我们俩都那么不擅长社交，我想也没什么好担心的。”

"Well, no." Shinji pauses to scratch an itch on his arm, and I can feel him moving against me. "But now that I think about it, she was kind of... free, in some ways. I saw her naked once and I don't think it really bothered her."
“嗯，没有。” 真嗣停顿了一下，挠了挠手臂上的痒，我能感觉到他靠在我身上。“但现在回想起来，她在某些方面似乎挺自由的。我有一次看到她裸体，她好像并不怎么在意。”

What a slut. I rub my face tiredly. "Yeah, that... figures, I suppose."
真是个放荡的女人。我疲惫地揉了揉脸。“是啊，那... 我想也是。”

"Yeah. Plus I touched one of her breasts."
“对。而且我还摸过她的一只乳房。”

"Ah. Yeah, you... wait, what?" Sitting up, I twist to punch his shoulder, hard. "How the hell did that happen?"
啊，对，你...等等，什么？" 我坐起身，扭动着给了他肩膀一拳，狠狠地。"这他妈是怎么回事？

He jerks upright as well, clutching his arm and scowling at me with those dark twilight eyes. "What the hell's your problem? She was naked and I got clumsy and fell on her!"
他也猛地坐直，捂着胳膊，用那双深邃的暮色眼睛怒视着我。"你他妈有毛病啊？她当时光着身子，我一不小心就摔她身上了！"

"Oh, very convenient." Lips twisting, I punch him again. "Were you going to tell me about that, you dumbass? Like, 'By the way, Asuka, I've seen yours and probably Misato's and I've touched Rei's. I'm the fucking Don Juan of losers!'" Another punch. Serves him right. "Who else? Hikari, maybe? Ritsuko?" Another punch, folded knuckles into his shoulder muscle.
"哦，真方便。" 我撇着嘴，又给了他一拳。"你这蠢货，是打算告诉我这事吗？比如，'顺便说一句，明日香，我看过你的，可能还有美里小姐的，我还碰过绫波的。我是这帮废物中的唐璜！'" 又是一拳。他活该。"还有谁？光，还是律子？" 又是一拳，拳头紧握，重重地打在他的肩肌上。

"Nobody else! You never asked, and it's not like I'm just going to drop that into a conversation at random!" He bats for a moment at my flailing arms, then catches and pulls them to cross my wrists over my chest. He's glaring at me from centimeters away now, not a snarling I'm-going-to-hit-you-back sort of glare, but more of an outraged how-dare-you-strike-me kind. Like I've offended his sensibilities more than I've angered or hurt him.
"没有别人了！你又没问过，我总不能随随便便就把这种事说出来吧！" 他一时招架不住我挥舞的手臂，然后抓住我的手腕，交叉在我的胸前。现在他离我只有几厘米远，瞪着我，不是那种我要反击的怒视，而是一种你怎么敢打我的愤慨。好像我触犯了他的原则，比激怒或伤害他更甚。

I can't move, though. It seems I've never really appreciated how strong his grip is now, or maybe it's just that his breath on my cheek has a paralyzing effect on me. I find that I'm just... staring at him, wide-eyed. Waiting to see what he does.
我动弹不得。似乎从未真正意识到他现在的握力有多强，或者也许是他呼在我脸颊上的气息让我麻痹了。我发现我正……睁大眼睛盯着他，一动不动。等待着看他下一步的动作。

After a moment he blinks, then clears his throat and offers a nervous smile. "Oh. Um... hi."
片刻后，他眨了眨眼，清了清喉咙，露出一丝紧张的微笑。“哦。嗯……嗨。”

I close my mouth -- I didn't realize it was open until now -- and swallow. His hands are shaking, I th-- no, those are mine. I'm shaking.
我合上嘴巴——直到现在才意识到它一直是张开的——然后咽了咽口水。他的手在颤抖，我以为是——不，那是我的手。我在发抖。

As though he realizes this at the same time, he releases me like I'm burning his hands, then reaches to toy with the hair on the back of his head. "Um, I'm... sorry. I shouldn't have, um...."
仿佛他也同时意识到了这一点，他立刻松开我，仿佛我的身体烫伤了他的手，然后伸手去拨弄后脑勺的头发。“嗯，我……对不起。我不应该，嗯……”

"Oh!" I twitch, then fold my hands into my lap and purse my lips. "No, I'm sorry. I guess I shouldn't... you know, hit you and stuff." I feel a little childish now, and he didn't even say anything.
"哦！" 我一惊，随即双手交叠放在膝上，抿紧了嘴唇。"不，对不起。我想我不该...你知道的，打你什么的。" 现在我感觉自己有点幼稚，而他甚至什么都没说。

"Yeah," he exhales, talking more to himself than me, I think. He's no longer meeting my gaze. With a frown and a little shake of his head, he shifts around, leaning back against the log once more. "That was sort of weird."
是啊，" 他叹了口气，与其说是在对我说话，不如说更像是在自言自语。他不再与我对视。皱着眉头，轻轻摇了摇头，他挪动了一下，再次背靠在圆木上。"那确实有点奇怪。

"Mmm." Eyeing him sideways, I chew my lip a moment longer, then join him against the log.
"嗯。" 我斜眼瞥了他一眼，又咬了一会儿嘴唇，然后也靠在了圆木上。

"Anyway," he murmurs over the crackling of the fire, "what about you?"
不管怎样，" 他在火堆噼啪声中低语，"你呢？

"What? What about me?" 什么？我怎么了？

He shifts. "I know you've gone on dates and stuff before, so you must have had boyfriends."
他挪动了一下身子。"我知道你以前约会过，肯定也有过男朋友。"

It actually takes a moment's thought to remember what he's talking about, and then I just smile ruefully up at the stars. "Never more than one date with any given guy. I guess they found me sort of... hard to get along with, I guess."
我得想一会儿才记起他在说什么，然后我苦笑着望向星空。"从来没有和同一个男生约会超过一次。我想他们觉得我有点……难以相处吧。"

"Weird," he acknowledges after a moment. "I don't understand that at all."
真奇怪，"他沉默片刻后承认道，"我完全无法理解。

"Yeah, fuck you." Stretching arms above my head, I take the chance to shift a little closer to him. "Not like you were a prize either."
对，去你的。" 我伸了个懒腰，趁机向他挪近了一点。"你也算不上什么宝贝。

He shrugs again, unconcerned by this insult, and his arm finds its way around my shoulder. "Wanna play cards?
他又耸了耸肩，对这侮辱毫不在意，手臂自然地搭上了我的肩膀。"想玩牌吗？"

I shake my head. "Nah. This is nicer."
我摇了摇头。"不了。这样挺好。"

"Yeah, I thought so too."
嗯，我也这么觉得。

I roll my eyes at this. "Why'd you even ask, then?"
我对此翻了个白眼。“那你干嘛还问？”

He doesn't answer, and I find myself grinning at the sky. Then I blink, abruptly aware of how close we are, how we're touching.
他没有回答，而我发现自己正对着天空咧嘴笑。然后我眨了眨眼，突然意识到我们靠得有多近，我们的身体触碰着。

It's strange, still. There are times, like this, when it just strikes me how new this still is. It was only a few days ago we started sleeping in the same tent. A week ago I was sure I still hated him. And now we're a couple, and we cuddle. I cuddle. With Shinji.
这依旧很奇怪。有时候，就像现在，我会突然意识到这一切是多么新鲜。就在几天前，我们才开始睡在同一个帐篷里。一周前我还确信自己仍然讨厌他。而现在我们成了一对，我们依偎在一起。我依偎着。和真嗣一起。

"You okay?" he murmurs, giving my shoulder a squeeze without looking over at me. "You sort of twitched there."
“你还好吗？”他低声问道，没有看向我，只是捏了捏我的肩膀。“你刚才好像抽搐了一下。”

I'm still not sure how this all happened, how easily I shifted from one extreme to another in my opinion of him. Or maybe I was always like this, and my frustration with all his weaknesses just made me pissed-off and disgusted. I don't know. What I do know is even though this strikes me as weird intellectually, it doesn't feel weird. It feels normal.
我仍然不确定这一切是如何发生的，我如何轻易地从一个极端转向另一个极端，对他看法大变。或许我一直是这样，只是对他所有弱点的失望让我感到愤怒和厌恶。我不知道。我所知道的是，尽管从理智上这让我觉得奇怪，但它并不感觉奇怪。它感觉很正常。

"Asuka?" He turns to give me a concerned frown.
"明日香？" 他转过身来，眉头紧锁，显得有些担忧。

"I'm fine." I flash him a sunny grin and he nods, turning his attention skyward again.
"我没事。" 我朝他露出一个灿烂的笑容，他点了点头，再次将目光投向天空。

I keep studying him after he looks away. His face is the same as when I met him, half-boyish, half-manly, only now it's seasoned by a confidence I doubt I could shake if I spent my whole life trying, confidence he's probably not even aware he has. His brow is a little creased now, as if in thought, like he's pondering something profound as he stares up at the red ring of souls. And maybe he is. He's always asked deeper questions than I have.
他转过头后，我继续观察他。他的脸和我初见时一样，半是少年，半是成熟，只是现在多了一份我怀疑即使我穷尽一生也无法动摇的自信，这份自信他可能自己都未曾察觉。他的眉头微微皱起，似乎在沉思，就像他在凝视着那圈红色灵魂之环时，正在思考着什么深奥的问题。也许他真的在思考。他总是提出比我更深刻的问题。

A casual observer would think he's just another quiet kid, but he and I... we were gods once. We did shit no one would believe if they hadn't seen it. And Shinji... Shinji's a guy who can literally hold the world in the palm of his hand and hate everything about it, and still choose to let it go on living, even on the assumption that he'd be doing so in eternal loneliness.
一个不经意的旁观者或许会认为他只是又一个沉默寡言的孩子，但他和我...我们曾是神一般的存在。我们做过的事情，若非亲眼所见，无人会信。而真嗣...真嗣是个能将世界握于掌心，对一切心生厌恶，却仍选择让其继续存在的人，哪怕这意味着他将永远孤独。

That's why I know he'll never hurt me again. He got all of the hurting out of his system already.
正因如此，我知道他再也不会伤害我了。他已经把所有的伤害都释放出来了。

Eventually he glances over at me with confused look on his face. Then he smiles, a little uncomfortably. "What is it?"
最终，他带着困惑的表情朝我这边瞥了一眼。然后他笑了，略显尴尬。“怎么了？”

I shake my head and settle back against the log again, pausing to hug his arm to myself. Then I place a kiss on the skin just below where his shirt sleeve ends. He still smells like soap, after bathing hours ago. Soap and wood smoke.
我摇了摇头，再次靠在原木上，停顿了一下，紧紧抱住他的手臂。随后，我在他衬衫袖口下方的皮肤上轻轻一吻。尽管沐浴已久，他身上依旧散发着肥皂和木柴烟熏的味道。

He freezes, then gives me an awkward one-armed hug. I figured our first real kiss, as such, would surprise him, and though it has, he seems somehow even stiffer than I would've expected. Only when his fingers twitch against the shirt over my stomach does it occur to me why this is: he's trying to hug me while I'm holding his forearm between my breasts, and he's trying to do it without touching them further.
他僵住了，然后给了我一个尴尬的单臂拥抱。我本以为我们的第一次真正接吻会让他吃惊，虽然确实如此，但他似乎比我预想的还要僵硬。直到他的手指在我肚子上的衬衫上抽动，我才意识到原因：我正把他的前臂夹在胸前，而他试图在不进一步触碰的情况下拥抱我。

I'm sure he can feel my smile against his bicep. On impulse I squeeze his arm tighter against myself, hoping to make the message clear. Then I rub my cheek against his arm and speak in a low voice. "Shinji?"
我确信他能感觉到我的笑容贴在他的二头肌上。一时冲动，我更紧地夹住他的手臂，希望他能明白我的意思。然后我蹭了蹭他的手臂，低声说道：“真嗣？”

I can hear him lick his lips. "Yeah?"
我能听见他舔嘴唇的声音。“嗯？”

I let my eyes slide shut, though my smile remains. "Whatcha thinkin?"
我闭上眼睛，但笑容依旧。“你在想什么呢？”

"Oh. Um, that this is nice." His fingers begin to trace absent circles against my stomach.
"哦，嗯，这感觉挺好的。" 他的手指开始在我肚子上漫无目的地画着圈。

I bet that's not all he's thinking. "Mmm. Shinji?"
我敢打赌他想的不仅仅是这个。"嗯，真嗣？"

He swallows. "Yeah?" 他咽了咽口水。"怎么了？"

"You can say it." 你想说什么就说吧。

"Um... say what?" 呃... 你说啥？

I don't answer, just sit there without releasing his arm, and he doesn't try to take it back. In a way this sort of bugs me; I'd prefer it if he just went and took what he wanted from me... but I can't really hold him at fault for that, not when I haven't done anything before now either. Plus, even though he's more attractive when he's confident, he's cuter when he's just a little off-balance and I'm not, so this is fun. And in any case, if he were on the offensive instead of me, I'd probably just get angry at him for taking me for granted, so who knows, maybe this is better.
我没有回答，只是坐在那里，没有放开他的手臂，他也没有试图抽回。某种程度上，这让我有点烦；我宁愿他直接来拿他想要的... 但我不能真的因此责怪他，毕竟我之前也没做什么。而且，尽管他自信时更有魅力，但他略显局促而我从容时，他显得更可爱，这挺有趣的。再说，如果他采取攻势而不是我，我可能会因为他认为我理所当然而生气，所以谁知道呢，也许这样更好。

When the silence stretches, I sigh, long and slow, and thread my fingers through his own. "Go ahead. I'm not going to judge you or anything."
当沉默持续时，我叹了口气，悠长而缓慢，将我的手指穿过他的手指。"说吧。我不会评判你的。"

He swallows again, then sighs as well. "Fine. It's just that you're... the stuff you're doing is, uh... it's... turning me on."
他又咽了咽口水，然后也叹了口气。"好吧。只是你... 你做的那些事，呃... 就是... 让我兴奋起来了。"

Huh. He actually said it. I manage to summon a glare from somewhere. "Wait, what? Here I'm trying to cuddle and your mind is in the gutter? For fuck's sake, Shinji!"
呵，他居然说出来了。我费力地从某个角落里挤出一个怒视。“等等，什么？我正想抱抱你，你脑子里却尽是些下流事？真是的，真嗣！”

He tries to jerk his arm away. "Aw, come on! You said you wouldn't judge me!"
他试图抽回手臂，“哎呀，别这样！你说过不会对我评头论足的！”

I elbow his ribs, making him jump. "That was before I knew what you were thinking, perv!"
我用手肘顶了顶他的肋骨，让他一跳。“那是在我不知道你脑子里想什么之前，变态！”

Grunting, he shifts around before settling back into place. "Oh, whatever. It's not like you're really mad."
他咕哝着，翻来覆去一阵后才重新躺好。“哦，得了吧。你又不是真的生气。”

"Oh?" Sometimes I forget that he's wise now. Bastard can probably see right through me. "What makes you say that?"
哦？" 有时候我忘了他现在变得睿智了。这家伙恐怕能一眼看穿我。"你怎么这么说？

"I can just tell. And you're, uh, still holding my arm." His finger pokes my stomach once for emphasis. "So nice try, but I know you're happy I said that."
我就是能感觉到。而且，呃，你还抓着我的胳膊呢。" 他用手指戳了戳我的肚子以示强调。"所以，虽然你装得挺好，但我知道你听到我那么说很高兴。

Right. Damn it. I risk a dark sideways glance only to find that he's just staring at the stars. Miniature orange flames dance in his eyes.
对啊。该死。我冒险斜眼瞥了他一眼，却发现他只是凝望着星空。他眼中闪烁着微小的橙色火焰。

After a moment I give my shoulders a frustrated roll. "Thanks for killing the mood, slick."
过了一会儿，我懊恼地耸了耸肩。"多谢你破坏气氛，机灵鬼。"

He sways in a silent chuckle. "Yeah. I killed the mood." I bristle, but he continues before I can speak. "Anyway, I have a question for you."
他无声地轻笑摇摆。"是啊，我破坏了气氛。"我心头一紧，但他没等我开口就继续说道，"不管怎样，我有个问题想问你。"

I release his arm to examine my fingernails in the dim light, but he doesn't move. Good. "Fine. What's your stupid question?"
我松开他的手臂，借着昏暗的光线审视自己的指甲，而他并未离开。很好。"行吧，你那愚蠢的问题是什么？"

Something pops in the fire, sending sparks braiding skyward for the moment it takes them to fade to nothing. Shinji heaves a sigh. "Our first kiss, back at Misato's place... what was that all about, anyway?"
火堆中突然噼啪作响，火花如编辫般直冲天际，转瞬即逝。真嗣长叹一声。"我们第一次接吻，在美里家那次...到底是怎么回事？"

Oh, yeah. My teeth clench together but I take a deep breath, forcing myself to relax. I get it now, why he didn't react, why he just stood there like a fucking mannequin when I kissed him, but that was sort of the beginning of the end for us, I think. When I can trust myself to speak again, I swallow, then do so in a quiet voice. "Basically... I was mad at Kaji for staying out with Misato. And you were there."
哦，对了。我咬紧牙关，却深吸一口气，强迫自己放松。现在我明白了，为何他没有反应，为何当我吻他时，他像个该死的假人一样站在那里，但那似乎是我们关系走向终结的开始。当我确信自己能开口时，我咽了咽口水，然后用平静的声音说道，"基本上...我因为加持和美里在外面而生气。而你就在那儿。"

He doesn't move, doesn't acknowledge this, as we sit together under the stars. Eventually, though, he slumps somewhat, letting his head loll back. "Is that really why? That was all?" His voice has dropped to a fearful whisper.
他一动不动，对这一切毫无反应，我们一同坐在星空下。然而，最终他还是略显颓然，头向后仰去。“真的只是因为这个吗？就这些？”他的声音已降至颤抖的低语。

I close my eyes. "I wish I could tell you otherwise, honestly, but that was almost verbatim what was going through my head at the time." I pause, turning my head in his direction without opening my eyes. "But, Shinji... if it had been anyone but you... I wouldn't have done it."
我闭上眼睛。“说实话，我希望我能说些别的，但那几乎就是我当时脑海中的原话。”我停顿了一下，闭着眼转向他的方向。“但是，真嗣……如果不是你……我是不会那么做的。”

Clothes whisper and his cheek presses against my forehead. "Okay. I believe you."
衣物轻响，他的脸颊贴在我的额头上。“好吧。我相信你。”

I nod without speaking, glad that my eyes are closed. In retrospect it was a selfish, shitty thing to do, toying with him like that to make myself feel better, but now his forgiveness is so obvious and inevitable, at least in his head, that he doesn't even bother to say it. He just assumes I know.
我点了点头，没有出声，庆幸自己的眼睛是闭着的。回想起来，那真是个自私又糟糕的行为，为了让自己感觉好些而那样戏弄他，但现在他的原谅是如此明显且必然，至少在他看来，他甚至懒得说出口。他只是认为我知道。

"So... yeah," I whisper when I can speak again. "Sorry for... for smothering you. I guess that was pretty rude, huh?"
那么...嗯，"我再次能说话时低声说道，"抱歉，刚才...刚才那样压着你。我想那挺无礼的，对吧？

His cheek curves into my forehead; I imagine his smile is fond. "Yeah, maybe. But you smelled nice. And your lips are soft."
他的脸颊贴着我的额头；我想象着他那宠溺的微笑。"嗯，可能吧。但你闻起来很香。而且你的嘴唇很柔软。"

Oh? "What did I smell like? I don't even remember."
哦？"我闻起来像什么？我都不记得了。"

He shrugs. "Not sure. Shampoo, maybe? Something... it makes me think of... vanilla?"
他耸了耸肩。"不太确定。洗发水，可能？有点像...让我想起...香草味？"

"Oh. Lotion." Misato's lotion, actually. I nod, reaching over to curl absent fingers into the soft fabric of his shirt. Above us, a twinkling star etches a slow path across the heavens, probably some forgotten satellite catching the missing sun. "And what was that about my lips?"
哦，润肤露。"其实是美里小姐的润肤露。我点头，伸手轻轻抓住他衬衫的柔软布料。头顶上，一颗闪烁的星星缓缓划过天际，可能是某个被遗忘的卫星，捕捉着缺失的阳光。"你刚才说我嘴唇怎么了？

"You heard me." His voice is low now, amused.
"你听到了。"他的声音现在低沉而带着笑意。

"Well, yeah," I murmur, sliding one hand under his shirt to touch his stomach. "I'm just surprised that you, of all people, remembered my lips when I think my chest was touching you."
嗯，是啊，"我低声说着，一只手滑进他的衬衫下，触摸他的腹部。"我只是惊讶，你居然记得我的嘴唇，而我以为我的胸部正贴着你呢。

He snorts -- actually snorts -- at this, and gives my stomach an affectionate pat. "You think about your boobs way too much, Asuka. You have other nice features."
他对此嗤之以鼻——真的嗤之以鼻——然后在我肚子上温柔地拍了一下。"明日香，你想你的胸部想得太多了。你还有其他不错的特点。"

I hesitate, offended, but curiosity gets the better of me. "Like what?"
我犹豫着，感到被冒犯，但好奇心占了上风。“像什么？”

"Like all of them." “像所有人一样。”

I pinch his stomach, not enough to hurt him. "That's not an answer." Still, it's pretty smooth, especially for him. Maybe there's hope for him yet.
我捏了捏他的肚子，力度不足以让他感到疼痛。“这不是答案。”不过，他的肚子倒是挺平滑的，尤其是对他来说。或许他还有救。

"Well," he sighs, "I could tell you, but then it would go to your head. And that's the last thing you need."
“唉，”他叹了口气，“我可以告诉你，但那样你会得意忘形。而那正是你最不需要的。”

"You're such an ass." 你真是个混蛋。

His arm tightens briefly around my neck. "Yeah. But this way you have to keep me around to find out."
他的手臂短暂地紧了紧我的脖子。"是啊。但这样你就得留我在身边，才能弄清楚了。"

"Whatever. Fine." I shift, letting my head rest on his chest, and I can hear his pounding heartbeat. He's keeping himself pretty composed for how excited he is. "But seriously, though, you are an ass."
随你便。好吧。" 我挪动了一下，让头靠在他的胸膛上，我能听到他那怦怦直跳的心跳声。他倒是挺能控制自己的，尽管内心如此激动。"不过说真的，你就是个混蛋。

"You'll live." 你死不了。

"Mmm." I roll lips between my teeth, letting my fingers roam along his stomach. "What are you thinking?"
嗯。" 我轻咬着唇，手指在他腹部游走。"你在想什么？

He shifts in a quiet chuckle. "You just asked me that, like... two minutes ago."
他轻笑一声，身体微动。"你刚刚才问过我，好像...两分钟前吧。"

"Oh, yeah." 哦，对。

"What about you?" 你呢？

"Me?" I take a moment to ponder this while tracing the shallow ridges of his stomach muscles. Then, rather than answer with words, I lift my face to his neck and pause there, letting my breath warm his skin. And then I plant a soft kiss there.
"我吗？" 我一边思索着，一边用手指轻轻划过他腹肌上浅浅的纹理。随后，我没有用言语回答，而是抬起脸庞贴近他的脖颈，在那里停顿，让我的呼吸温暖他的肌肤。接着，我在那里轻柔地印下一吻。

Shinji freezes; his hand on my stomach curls into a fist, balling up the fabric, and for a wild moment I fear he might actually rip it off me, but such proves not to be the case. Rather, after his initial shock passes, he twists to kiss my temple.
真嗣僵住了；他放在我腹部的手握成了拳头，攥紧了布料，有那么一瞬间，我惊恐地以为他真的会把它撕下来，但事实并非如此。相反，在最初的震惊过后，他转过身来，亲吻了我的太阳穴。

He can do better than that. I edge my face up, almost nuzzling his own out of the way, and kiss his cheek. My breath is coming quickly now, my chest buzzing.
他可以做得更好。我微微抬起脸，几乎要把他的脸挤开，亲吻了他的脸颊。我的呼吸变得急促，胸口仿佛有电流穿过。

He takes the hint and counters by sliding his lips to mine. Our kiss is jerky and hot, with rough edges we'll need practice smoothing out. It's also infinitely better than the disastrous first one, because not only is he actively participating now, he's even grabbing my shoulders to pull me closer, and... and he's... the, um... warm... I'm not....
他领会了我的暗示，回应着将嘴唇滑向我的唇。我们的吻急促而热烈，带着需要练习才能平滑的粗糙边缘。这比第一次灾难般的吻要好得多，因为他现在不仅积极参与，还抓住我的肩膀把我拉得更近，而且...而且他...那个，呃...温暖的...我并不是...

Later, when we finally break the kiss, I let my head thump against his collarbone and wait for breath and reason to return to me. My fingers curl and straighten in the fabric of his t-shirt without conscious direction, and I can feel my pulse racing in the roof of my mouth with every nervous swallow.
后来，当我们终于结束这个吻，我将头靠在他的锁骨上，等待呼吸和理智回归。我的手指无意识地在 T 恤面料上蜷曲又伸直，每一次紧张的吞咽都能感觉到口腔上颚的脉搏加速跳动。

He's still frozen with one arm around me, probably staring off at the shadowed tent behind me. I can almost see the wheels spinning in his head, can read his thoughts like text on a page. He knew we were a couple before this, but being Shinji, hadn't taken the physical aspect for granted. Now that that plane has been opened for him, however, I'm sure what's unfolding in his head is one perverted scenario after another as it sinks in that I might, just might, be willing to do those things with him, that those are fair and plausible things to ask of a serious relationship.
他仍僵硬地用一只手臂环抱着我，目光可能正凝视着我身后那顶阴影中的帐篷。我几乎能看见他脑海中思绪的转动，读懂他的想法如同阅读书页上的文字。他之前就知道我们是情侣，但作为真嗣，从未想当然地考虑过肉体层面。然而，现在这个领域对他敞开了，我确信他脑海中正展开一系列扭曲的情景，逐渐意识到我或许，仅仅是或许，愿意与他做那些事，那些在一段认真的关系中既合理又可能被要求的事情。

Or maybe that's just what's in my head, but in any case... not tonight. The thought disappoints me, makes me roll nervous lips between my teeth, but... I think it's for the best. The old Asuka would have been jumping all over such a chance, while the old Shinji would have been aghast at any human contact at all, so I think somewhere in the middle is probably the wisest choice.
或许这只是我脑海中的想法，但无论如何...不是今晚。这个念头让我失望，让我紧张地将嘴唇夹在牙齿间，但...我认为这是最好的选择。过去的明日香可能会抓住这样的机会四处蹦跳，而过去的真嗣则会因为任何人类的接触而惊慌失措，所以我想，在两者之间找到平衡点可能是最明智的。

Eventually he exhales, almost slumping, and shakes his head. One hand gives my shoulder a squeeze, while the other starts toying with the hair spilling down my back. "So... that was kinda...."
最终他长出了一口气，几乎要瘫软下来，摇了摇头。一只手紧握我的肩膀，另一只手开始摆弄我垂落在背上的头发。"所以...那真是有点..."

I clear my throat. "Yeah. We, um... yeah." I giggle, then cut myself off with a solemn frown, all without lifting my head from his chest.
我清了清嗓子。"是啊。我们，嗯...是啊。"我咯咯笑了起来，随即又严肃地皱起眉头，打断了自己的笑声，头依旧靠在他的胸膛上。

He takes another deep breath, then rests his chin on my head. "I... can't remember what we were talking about."
他又深吸了一口气，然后将下巴搁在我的头上。"我...记不得我们刚才在聊什么了。"

"Does it matter?" 这重要吗？

"Hmm. Guess not." 嗯，看来不重要。

I slide my eyes sideways to stare at the fire still crackling away. "Hey."
我斜眼望向那仍在噼啪作响的火焰，轻声道："喂。"

"Yeah." 对。

I draw my brows together, considering how to word it. "I made the first move tonight, but if you ever make me do that more than, say... twice in a row, I'm going to kick you in the nuts afterwards. Be a man and take what's yours."
我皱起眉头，斟酌着如何表达。"今晚是我先主动的，但如果你让我连续这么做超过两次，我就会在事后踢你的要害。像个男人一样，去争取你应得的。"

He sways with a chuckle. "That's sort of the reaction I'm afraid of even if I do what you're asking."
他轻笑一声，身体随之摇摆。“即便我按你说的做，这种反应也是我担心的。”

I give my lips a twist at this. "What? You're scared of taking the initiative?"
我对此撇了撇嘴。“什么？你害怕主动出击？”

"No, I'm joking. Point taken."
“不，我开玩笑的。明白了。”

"Good." My eyes drift shut. I can still hear his racing heart. "So we have an understanding?"
“好。”我闭上眼睛，仍能听见他急促的心跳。“那我们算是达成共识了？”

"I just said we do."
我刚说了我们会的。

I smile, letting the fire warm my face as Shinji warms the rest of me; in the slow aftermath of my excitement, I'm actually starting to feel a little sleepy. It sounds stupid, a little saccharine, but... in retrospect Third Impact was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I don't even remember if I wanted anything like this before it or not -- the months preceding the end of the world are sort of a blur now -- but I'd go through it all again if I had to, a dozen times, just for this. Just for this sense of openness, of acceptance, the knowledge that I can show Shinji all the ugly and hissing parts of my soul and he'll still love me as much as he does now.
我微笑着，让火焰温暖我的脸庞，而真嗣则温暖着我的其余部分；在激动的余韵中，我竟开始感到一丝困意。这听起来或许愚蠢，略带甜腻，但……回想起来，第三次冲击大概是我生命中发生过的最好的事情。我甚至记不清在那之前我是否渴望过这样的生活——世界末日前的几个月现在已是一片模糊——但如果必须的话，我愿意重历这一切，哪怕十几次，只为这份感受。只为这种豁达，这种接纳，知道我可以向真嗣展示我灵魂中所有丑陋和嘶嘶作响的部分，而他依然会像现在这样深爱我。

He's not going to hear such a sappy thing from my lips, however.
不过，他可不会从我嘴里听到这么肉麻的话。

He already knows. 他早已知晓。

"Hey," he murmurs, "do you want to go to bed soon?" His voice vibrates through my skull, hums in my heart.
"嘿，"他低声说，"你想不想一会儿就睡觉？"他的声音穿透我的颅骨，在我心中回响。

I give my head a little shake. "I like it here."
我轻轻摇了摇头。"我喜欢这里。"

"Okay." His arms tighten around me, and I smile.
"好吧。"他的手臂紧了紧，我笑了。

A/N: So, what's the verdict? Does it work or does it cheapen the story? I'm torn, personally, as I've never written an epilogue before. If enough people are gagging or flinching at this chapter I might pull it down, or maybe post it elsewhere.
作者按：那么，结论如何？这样写是增色还是贬低了故事？我个人很纠结，因为我以前从未写过尾声。如果足够多的人对此章节感到恶心或皱眉，我可能会撤下它，或者考虑发到别处。
