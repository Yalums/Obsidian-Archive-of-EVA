**Chapter 1: Prologue: Here We Go Again  
第一章：序章：我们又来了**

_"As of 01:12:30 PM today, a special state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chubu regions surrounding the Tokai district. All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately. Repeating: As of 01:12:30 PM today, the Kanto and Chubu regions surrounding the Tokai district have been declared to be under a state of emergency. All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately."  
截至今天下午 1 点 12 分 30 秒，已宣布对围绕东海地区的关东和中部地区实施特别紧急状态。所有居民必须立即撤离至指定避难所。重复：截至今天下午 1 点 12 分 30 秒，围绕东海地区的关东和中部地区已被宣布进入紧急状态。所有居民必须立即撤离至指定避难所。_

Shinji looked at the telephone headset in his left hand, letting out a frustrated groan. Last time hadn't been too bad – he got together with Asuka surprisingly early – just after the fight with Sahaquiel. In fact, it was a record for him. Most of the time they would get together after the kiss, sometimes later, sometimes sooner.  
真嗣看着左手中的电话耳机，发出了一声沮丧的呻吟。上次还不算太糟——他意外地很早就和明日香在一起了——就在与萨哈魁尔战斗之后不久。实际上，这对他来说是个纪录。大多数时候，他们会在接吻后才在一起，有时晚些，有时早些。

But that didn't matter for now.  
但眼下这并不重要。

Because all of those different lives he experienced had ended.  
因为所有那些他经历过的不同生活都已经结束了。

Last time it ended with Third Impact – not an uncommon destiny.  
上次以第三次冲击结束——并非罕见的命运。

Shinji gripped the headset with such force that it began to crack. He threw it on the wall; the plastic creation shattered into pieces, falling down to the ground.  
真嗣紧握着耳机，力度之大以至于它开始裂开。他将耳机摔向墙壁；这塑料制品碎裂成片，散落一地。

Just how many times had he been through this?  
他究竟经历了多少次这样的循环？

The first time he thought he was given a second chance – to fix everything. He was ecstatic. He tried everything he could to make things right; he brought Rei out of her shell, he got together with Asuka and helped her through her mental breakdown, he even saved Kaji – but in the end, SEELE still won, and murdered Asuka just as brutal as the first time – but that time, he had to watch.  
第一次他以为自己得到了第二次机会——去修正一切。他欣喜若狂。他竭尽所能去弥补过错；他让丽走出了自己的壳，他与明日香走到一起并帮助她度过精神崩溃，他甚至救了加持——但最终，SEELE 依然获胜，并以同样残忍的方式杀害了明日香——但那一次，他不得不亲眼目睹。

Then he was given another chance. Then another. Then another.  
然后他又得到了一次机会。接着又是一次。再然后又是一次。

Shinji shook the thoughts off – he didn't need brooding now. He needed to get out of here quickly – there were still slim chances of danger being in the middle of the battleground.  
真嗣甩开了这些念头——他现在不需要沉思。他需要尽快离开这里——战场上仍有微小的危险可能。

He learned this lesson from experience.  
他从经验中学到了这个教训。

The ground shook just on time – this time Shinji was already hundreds of meters away from his original spot. The VTOL crashed down to the ground; a fireball engulfed his former spot.  
地面恰到好处地颤动——这一次，真嗣已经远离了原来的位置数百米。垂直起降飞机坠落地面，火球吞噬了他原先所在的地方。

The sound of engine roaring captured his attention. He smiled as a familiar blue RA130 pulled closer and screeched to a halt in front of him. Shinji got sentimental in the first few times and almost had a breakdown every time he saw the familiar Major – Captain for now – but he soon grew out of it after he realized he still had many encounters like this awaiting. "Sorry I'm late! Get in the car!" Shinji smiled and hopped in. Misato Katsuragi slammed the pedal; the car rushed down the empty street thrice the speed limit.  
引擎的轰鸣声吸引了他的注意。一辆熟悉的蓝色 RA130 逐渐靠近，尖锐地刹车停在他面前，他笑了。真嗣在最初几次见到这位熟悉的大尉——现在是上尉——时感到动情，几乎每次都会崩溃，但很快他就意识到还有许多类似的遭遇在等待着他，于是逐渐习惯了。“抱歉我来晚了！上车！”真嗣笑着跳上车。葛城美里猛踩油门；车子以三倍于限速的速度冲下空旷的街道。

Deep down the ground, inside NERV headquarters, Gendo Ikari smirked behind his clasped hands as the generals of JSSDF continued ordering effortless attacks against the Third Angel.  
在地底深处，NERV 总部内，碇源堂双手合十，嘴角露出一丝冷笑，看着日本自卫队的高级将领们继续对第三使徒发起徒劳的攻击。

He didn't know his scenario would face a substantial alternation today.  
他不知道今天自己的剧本会面临重大的改变。

"Misato, don't stop here," Shinji said calmly as they passed a certain part of the highway.  
“美里，别在这里停下，”真嗣平静地说道，他们经过高速公路的某个部分。

"Eh?" Misato blinked, "but… aren't you interested in the battle?" With that being said, she still released the brakes and the car sped up once more.  
“诶？”美里眨了眨眼，“但是……你不是对战斗感兴趣吗？”尽管如此，她还是松开了刹车，车子再次加速。

"I…just want to get as far away from…that thing as possible." His tone was unwavering.  
"我……只想尽可能远离……那东西。" 他的语气坚定不移。

"Sure," Misato frowned, "you don't have a sense of adventure, do you?"  
"当然，" 美里皱眉道，"你就没有一点冒险精神，是吧？"

Just like Shinji had calculated, the world went white as they passed through a tunnel. From the hundreds - perhaps even thousands – of cycles he experienced, one thing he learned to do was to make sure Misato would drive into the tunnel when the N2 mine went off.  
正如真嗣所计算的那样，当他们穿过隧道时，世界变成了一片白色。从他经历的数百次——或许甚至数千次——循环中，他学会了一件事，那就是确保美里会在 N2 地雷爆炸时驶入隧道。

Misato slammed on the brakes – the screech of the tires echoed in the tunnel, magnifying as the sound waves bounced off the walls.  
美里猛踩刹车——轮胎的尖叫声在隧道中回荡，声音波纹在墙壁间反弹，愈发响亮。

"That…was a good idea," Misato let out a sigh of relief; Shinji just smirked in response. She always had the same reaction.  
“那……是个好主意，”美里松了口气；真嗣只是微微一笑作为回应。她总是有同样的反应。

XXXXXX

He had seen the same sight so many times that even the magnificent sight of Geofront wouldn't amaze him anymore. However, Shinji still acted amazed – much to Misato's satisfaction. His thought kept wandering around a specific person as Misato went on about how great NERV was and how it was the savior of mankind.  
他已见过这景象无数次，以至于连地底都市的壮观景象也无法再让他惊叹。然而，真嗣仍装出惊叹的样子——这让美里颇为满意。当美里滔滔不绝地讲述 NERV 的伟大以及它是人类救星时，真嗣的思绪却始终围绕着某个特定的人。

His father. 他的父亲。

Shinji loathed his father – the emotion was accumulated through the countless lives he lived. He was always a manipulative monster – he never hesitated to use the Second Child to blackmail his own son in order to achieve his desired end of the scenario. He tried to fight against him – he really tried. But he could never protect Asuka in the process.  
真嗣憎恨他的父亲——这种情感是在他无数次生命中积累起来的。他总是一个操纵人心的怪物——从不犹豫利用第二适格者来要挟自己的儿子，以达到他想要的剧情结局。他试图反抗他——他真的尝试过。但在过程中，他永远无法保护明日香。

Shinji began to emphasize his father.  
真嗣开始强调他的父亲。

This time, he would do something completely different. Not that he gave up – he simply didn't want to see Asuka get hurt anymore.  
这次，他要做出完全不同的选择。并非他放弃了——只是他再也不想看到明日香再受伤害。

"So this is the Third Child?" Ritsuko Akagi asked, her eyes arrogant, if not condescending.  
“这就是第三适格者吗？”赤木律子问道，眼神中带着傲慢，甚至有些轻蔑。

"Excuse me, ma'am," Shinji huffed, "my name is Shinji Ikari."  
“对不起，女士，”真嗣喘着气说，“我叫碇真嗣。”

"Well, he does resemble a lot of his father."  
“嗯，他确实很像他父亲。”

Shinji couldn't help but chuckle at the remark. The doctor couldn't have been farther from the truth, nor could she have been closer.  
听到这话，真嗣忍不住笑了。医生的话既离真相甚远，又近在咫尺。

Shinji pretended to be surprised as the lights lit up, Unit 01's purple armor shining under the artificial lights.  
灯光亮起时，真嗣假装惊讶，零号机的紫色装甲在人造灯光下闪闪发光。

"You won't find this in the manual." Ritsuko interrupted as Shinji scanned through the manual, "This is Man's ultimate humanoid fighting machine, the first model of the synthetic life form Evangelion, Unit 01. Built here in secret, it is Mankind's last hope."  
"你不会在手册里找到这个。" 赤木律子打断道，当真嗣翻阅手册时，"这是人类终极的人形战斗机器，合成生命体初号机，EVA Unit 01。在这里秘密建造，它是人类的最后希望。"

"Is this part of what my father's been doing?"  
"这是我父亲一直在做的事的一部分吗？"

"Correct. It's been a while." Shinji raised his head, looking directly into his father's cold gaze. His own was just as stern.  
"没错。已经有一段时间了。" 真嗣抬起头，直视着他父亲冷漠的目光。他自己的眼神也同样坚定。

"Father…" Shinji's voice was cold and stern, Commander Ikari raised an eyebrow hearing the voice.  
"父亲……" 真嗣的声音冷酷而严厉，碇司令听到这声音时扬起了一边的眉毛。

"We're moving out." "我们出发。"

"Moving out?! Unit 00's still in cryo-stasis, isn't it?" Misato glanced at Unit 01, "wait a second. You're going to use Unit 01?"  
"出发？！零号机还在冷冻状态，不是吗？" 美里瞥了一眼零号机，"等等。你要用零号机？"

"There's no other way." Ritsuko looked at Shinji, "Shinji Ikari. You will pilot it."  
"没有其他办法了。" 律子看着真嗣，"碇真嗣，你将驾驶它。"

"But even Rei Ayanami took seven months to synchronize with her Eva. It's impossible for him to do it! He just got here!"  
"但即使是绫波零也花了七个月才与她的 Eva 同步。他不可能做到的！他才刚到这里！"

"He just has to sit in the seat. We don't expect-"  
"他只需要坐在座位上。我们并不指望-"

"I'll pilot it," Shinji cut her off. Normally he would fight back a little, but considering this time he didn't intend to hide anything – from his father – he reckoned he could at least prevent Rei from getting hurt. Gendo Ikari narrowed his eyes – Shinji wasn't a little bit like what he was expecting.  
"我来驾驶它，" 真嗣打断了她。通常他会稍作反抗，但考虑到这次他不打算向父亲隐瞒任何事，他觉得至少可以避免让绫波受到伤害。碇源堂眯起了眼睛——真嗣并不完全是他所预料的那样。

Ritsuko and Misato fell silent at his words. "Alright then," Akagi broke the silence first, "follow the instructions."  
律子和美里在他的话后陷入了沉默。"好吧，" 阿卡季首先打破了沉默，"按照指示行动。"

Shinji still had to act startled by the procedures – especially the LCL infusion. "Oh my God, his sync rate is 87.5%, that's incredible!" Ritsuko exclaimed, "he's born for this!"  
真嗣仍然得表现得对这些程序感到惊讶——尤其是 LCL 注入。"哦，天哪，他的同步率是 87.5%，太不可思议了！" 律子惊呼，"他天生就是干这个的！"

Gendo smirked. Things were getting back to normal.  
源渡微微一笑。一切正逐渐恢复正常。

"Father…" Shinji's voice captured his attention, "we need to talk…after the battle."  
"父亲……" 真嗣的声音吸引了他的注意，"战斗结束后，我们需要谈谈。"

_"EVA LAUNCH!" "EVA 出击！"_

AN: Um, yeah that's the prologue. I left out a lot of unnecessary details – people who watched the TV series should know what they were, and those who haven't shouldn't be reading this. The next chapter may take longer to upload since I'm still wrapping up my other story – You Can (Not) Redo, which is my priority.  
作者注：嗯，这就是序章了。我省略了很多不必要的细节——看过电视剧的人应该知道那些是什么，而没看过的就不应该读这个。下一章可能需要更长时间上传，因为我还在完成我的另一部作品——《你无法重来》，那是我目前的优先事项。

I upload this piece to see how people think about this idea, and then I will decide whether I should continue it. So leave a review!  
我上传这篇作品是为了看看大家对这个想法的看法，然后再决定是否继续写下去。所以请留下评论吧！

## *Chapter 2*: Chapter 2: Deviance  
*第二章*: 第二章：偏差

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》

**Chapter 2: Deviance 第二章：偏差**

The fight was elegant and clean, just like Asuka said how it should be, and just like how it was in most of his earlier cycles. Shinji overpowered the Third Angel without too much effort; he fought it like actual fighting, _brawling –_ but not _combat_. He easily prevented Toji's sister from getting hurt – that was never troubling for him since his second chance. He couldn't show too much of his extraordinary EVA piloting skills he acquired from his countless lives, yet.  
战斗优雅而干净，正如明日香所说的那样，也正如他在大多数早期循环中所经历的那样。真嗣毫不费力地击败了第三使徒；他像真正的格斗一样与之搏斗——但并非战斗。他轻松地阻止了东治的妹妹受伤——这对他来说从未构成困扰，自他的第二次机会以来便是如此。他还不能展示出他从无数次生命中获得的非凡 EVA 驾驶技能。

"Good job, Shinji-kun," came Misato's voice in the communication channel, "go to retrieve shaft E-17, we'll handle the logistics."  
“干得好，真嗣君，”通讯频道中传来美里小姐的声音，“去回收 E-17 号井，我们会处理后勤。”

The sensation of weightlessness produced by the drop from the surface to the Geofront did little to distract him from his turmoil of thoughts. He had made a decision – a decision he'd never made before. How should he explain it? Would Gendo understand?  
从地面坠入第三新东京市所带来的失重感，并未能让他从纷乱的思绪中分神。他做出了一个决定——一个前所未有的决定。该如何解释呢？碇源堂会理解吗？

Shinji got a change of clothes and stepped out of the changing room. Misato should be taking him to negotiate his living arrangements now – and then he would meet his father in the elevator. That would be his chance.  
真嗣换好衣服，走出了更衣室。美里应该会带他去商讨居住事宜——然后他将在电梯里与父亲见面。那将是他的机会。

"Father…we need to talk," just like he predicted, Gendo Ikari showed up when the elevator door opened. He didn't answer; he was just staring at him with a cold expression. Misato felt a chill ran down her spine. _'I'm taking him in…if possible,'_ she thought.  
“父亲……我们需要谈谈，”正如他所预料的，当电梯门打开时，碇源堂出现了。他没有回答，只是用冷漠的表情盯着他。美里感到一阵寒意窜过脊背。‘我要带他走……如果可能的话，’她心想。

"I don't have time for irrelevant business," Gendo finally replied, his voice devoid of emotions.  
"我没时间处理无关紧要的事," 源渡终于回答道，他的声音毫无情感。

"Trust me…this is relevant," Shinji said calmly, his tone making Gendo narrowed his eyes. "Be quick," he said.  
"相信我…这是相关的," 真嗣平静地说，他的语气让源渡眯起了眼睛。 "快点说，" 他命令道。

"I prefer…your office than here, father," Shinji continued, "it's…safe from outside disturbances."  
"我更喜欢…在您的办公室而不是这里，父亲，" 真嗣继续说，"那里…可以避免外界的干扰。

Gendo narrowed his eyes further – Shinji was absolutely not what he was expecting him to be. In fact, he could be said as a complete antithesis of his expectations. "Follow me, pilot," he ordered, "Captain, go finish your own business."  
源渡眯起眼睛，更深了——真嗣绝对不是他所预期的样子。事实上，他可以说是完全背离了他的预期。“跟我来，驾驶员，”他命令道，“舰长，去忙你自己的事。”

XXXXXX

The office was cold and dark. No matter how many times he'd been here, it still gave him chills. "Speak, pilot," Gendo clasped his hands together, glaring at Shinji with a stern look.  
办公室冷清而昏暗。无论来过多少次，这里依然让他感到寒意。“说吧，驾驶员，”源渡双手合十，严厉地瞪着真嗣。

"I-" Shinji chose his next words carefully. One wrong step, he could be dead the next second. "I want to help you."  
“我——”真嗣小心翼翼地选择下一句。一步走错，下一秒他可能就死了。“我想帮你。”

Gendo Ikari blinked in surprise. He almost forgot what it was like to be surprised. "Help me…for what?" His tone just carried a tinge of curiosity.  
碇源堂惊讶地眨了眨眼。他几乎忘记了惊讶是什么感觉。“帮我…为了什么？”他的语气只是带着一丝好奇。

"Your…scenario," Shinji spoke slowly, "to…meet my mother."  
“你的…计划，”真嗣缓缓地说，“去…见我的母亲。”

In a blink of an eye, Gendo pulled out his pistol and aimed at his son, his hands were slightly shivering. "Who are you?" He demanded, his composure breaking down.  
眨眼之间，碇源堂拔出手枪对准了他的儿子，他的手微微颤抖。“你是谁？”他厉声质问，镇定自若的外表开始崩溃。

"I am Shinji Ikari, the Third Child, the pilot of Unit 01," he answered in calm. Gendo's reaction was expected – he had prepared himself to walk on a fine line. "more importantly…I came from the future."  
"我是碇真嗣，第三适格者，初号机的驾驶员，"他平静地回答。碇源堂的反应在意料之中——他已经准备好走钢丝了。"更重要的是……我来自未来。"

"I do not have time for jokes, _pilot_," Gendo released the gun's safety.  
"我没时间听你开玩笑，驾驶员，"碇源堂解开了手枪的保险。"

"I'm not joking, _father,_" Shinji stood his ground, "I know everything because I've seen them. I've experienced them." He sighed, bad memories resurfacing, "Third Impact…it offered me more than you think."  
"我不是在开玩笑，父亲，"真嗣坚定地站在原地，"我知道一切，因为我亲眼见过。我亲身经历过。"他叹了口气，不好的记忆再次浮现，"第三次冲击……它给予我的比你想象的更多。"

Gendo weighed his options. On one hand, his sanity was telling him this was just some cosmic fluke or a very real dream. On the other hand, his mind was telling him Shinji was telling the truth – there's _no way_ he could ever know about Third Impact, much less his plan to reunite with Yui. Even old men of SEELE didn't know it. On the third hand – it wouldn't hurt to hear more. "Explain yourself," he ordered, not putting the gun down.  
碇源堂权衡着他的选择。一方面，他的理智告诉他这可能只是某种宇宙巧合或是一个非常真实的梦境。另一方面，他的内心却在告诉他真嗣说的是真的——他不可能知道第三次冲击，更不用说他计划与唯重聚的事。就连 SEELE 的老人们也不知情。第三方面——再多听一些也无妨。“解释一下，”他命令道，枪并未放下。

"In short, I was at the center of Third Impact," he started, "and I refused the reality, then somehow I was sent back here," he left out all the details he didn't want his father to know, "I know what you want, father, and I also know how to stop SEELE," he improvised since he really had no idea how to do that – he had never succeeded – that's why he was here at the moment.  
“简而言之，我曾是第三次冲击的中心，”他开始说道，“我拒绝了这个现实，然后不知怎么就被送回了这里，”他省略了所有不想让父亲知道的细节，“我知道你想要什么，父亲，我也知道如何阻止 SEELE，”他即兴发挥，因为他真的不知道该怎么做——他从未成功过——这就是他此刻在这里的原因。

"Why?" Gendo snorted. He wasn't just going to believe everything his son said, but a little insight into his motives would help.  
“为什么？”碇源堂嗤之以鼻。他不会轻易相信儿子所说的一切，但了解一下他的动机会有所帮助。

"Because…let's say we're in the same shoes, father," Shinji kept gazing at the Commander, "you're doing all this for mother…and I…am doing all this for _her_." He took a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment, then reopened them, returning his gaze.  
"因为…假设我们处境相同，父亲，" 真嗣继续凝视着指挥官，"你做这一切是为了母亲…而我…也是为了她。" 他深吸一口气，闭上眼睛片刻，然后重新睁开，目光再次回到父亲身上。

Gendo chuckled internally. He'd never thought his socially awkward son would ever care about someone else so much – especially a girl. On second thought, this could be a perfect tool to blackmail his son. "What's your offer?" He lowered his gun.  
碇源堂内心轻笑。他从没想过自己这个社交笨拙的儿子会如此关心别人——尤其是个女孩。转念一想，这或许是个完美的工具来要挟他的儿子。"你的提议是什么？" 他放低了枪。

"Simple. I've got intel," Shinji sighed in relief internally, "I know _future_. I know why did you fail. I know how to help you win, in the end," Gendo raised his eyebrows, "however, there's one, and only one condition, that you would _never_ violate," he trailed off, waiting for his father's reply.  
"很简单。我有情报，" 真嗣内心松了口气，"我知道未来。我知道你为何失败。我知道如何帮你最终获胜，" 碇源堂扬起眉毛，"不过，有一个，且仅有一个条件，你绝不能违背，" 他停顿下来，等待父亲的回应。

Gendo pondered for a moment. He had to admit that Shinji's offer was alluring – of what he said was true in the first place, of course. "Prove you're really from the future," he finally decided to ask.  
源堂沉思片刻。他不得不承认，真嗣的提议颇具诱惑力——当然，前提是他所言非虚。“证明你确实来自未来。”他最终决定这样问道。

"What more do I need to do?" Shinji frowned, "I've already said so much that I wasn't supposed to know at all. Do you really need me to list the date of every incoming Angel attack? Do I need to draw every Angel for you?" His frown turned into a smirk, "or…do I need to say Rei Ayanami, the First Child, is a clone of Lilith and my mother?"  
“我还需要做什么？”真嗣皱眉，“我已经透露了那么多本不该知道的信息。你真的需要我列出每一次使徒袭击的日期吗？还是需要我为你画出每一个使徒？”他的皱眉转为一丝讥笑，“或者……我需要说出绫波零，第一适格者，是莉莉丝和我母亲的克隆体？”

"Hm." Gendo's tone was cold as usual, but his heartbeat rate had already doubled, cold sweat forming on his forehead. "What is your condition?"  
“嗯。”源堂的语气一如既往地冷漠，但他的心跳已加速一倍，额头上渗出了冷汗。“你的条件是什么？”

"Don't worry, it's not as ill-willed as you may think," Shinji's smirk still on his face, "I only need to…"  
"别担心，没你想象的那么恶意，" 真嗣的嘴角依然挂着一丝得意的笑，"我只是需要……"

"Asuka, get up and pack your stuff," Kaji Ryoji clapped his hands, trying to wake up the sleeping redhead. The said girl grudgingly opened her eyes – and shot them open once she recognized the person calling her. "KAJI!" She squealed like a schoolgirl, "it's so nice for you to come and see me!" She recalled Kaji's words, "wait, pack my stuff? Where we going?" Her face lit up as an idea formed in her mind, "ow! I'd love to go on a romantic trip with you, Kaji!"  
"明日香，起来收拾东西，" 加持良治拍了拍手，试图唤醒熟睡的红发少女。少女不情愿地睁开眼睛——随即在认出叫醒她的人后瞪大了双眼。"加持！" 她尖叫起来，像个女学生一样，"你能来看我真是太好了！" 她回想起加持的话，"等等，收拾东西？我们要去哪儿？" 她的脸因一个念头而亮了起来，"哦！我愿意和你一起去浪漫之旅，加持！"

Kaji chuckled nervously. He'd never gotten used to Asuka's crush on him. "No, Asuka. We're going to Japan. Specifically Tokyo-3, where NERV headquarters is."  
加持尴尬地笑了笑。他从未习惯明日香对他的迷恋。"不，明日香。我们要去日本。具体是第三新东京市，NERV 总部所在地。"

Asuka raised her eyebrows, "Tokyo-3? Why?"  
明日香挑了挑眉，“第三新东京市？为什么？”

"The Angels have come, and they need trained pilots and more EVAs. It's a direct order from the Commander."  
“使徒出现了，他们需要训练有素的驾驶员和更多的 EVA。这是司令官的直接命令。”

Asuka practically jumped from the ground, "YESSSSS! I've been waiting for this moment for so long!" She started to perform martial arts, pretending the air was her enemy.  
明日香几乎是从地上跳了起来，“耶！我等这一刻等了好久了！”她开始表演武术，假装空气是她的敌人。

Kaji chuckled at her enthusiasm, "good to see you excited, Asuka. The plane leaves in the afternoon, so quickly pack your stuff. Unit 02 will be transferred through the sea; it should arrive no more than two weeks later."  
加持对她的热情轻声笑道，“很高兴看到你这么兴奋，明日香。飞机下午起飞，所以赶紧收拾你的东西。二号机将通过海路运输；应该不超过两周就能到达。”

"Speaking of the Angels…you said they've come? So I assume they've already fought one?"  
“说到使徒……你说他们来了？那我猜他们已经打过一场了？”

"Yup. In fact, the Third Child completely obliterated it."  
“没错。实际上，第三适格者彻底摧毁了它。”

Asuka frowned, "I bet he just got lucky, being a rookie and all that! New comer's luck! His skills definitely nowhere mine!"  
明日香皱眉道：“我敢打赌他只是运气好，毕竟是个新手嘛！新人的运气！他的技术肯定远不如我！”

"He got a sync rate of 87.5% from his first time in an EVA," Kaji remarked.  
“他第一次驾驶 EVA 就达到了 87.5%的同步率，”加持评论道。

"MEIN GOTT IN HIMMEL!" Asuka cried. She worked so hard to get her own sync rate to the high 60s, and now this Third Child…he just came out of nowhere and ate her sync rate alive?! What a humiliation. "It must be a malfunctioning of the system! No matter what, I'll show him how a real pilot does it!"  
“我的天哪！”明日香惊呼。她费了那么大劲才把自己的同步率提升到 60 多，而这个第三适格者……他突然冒出来，把她的同步率全抢走了？！真是奇耻大辱。“一定是系统出了故障！无论如何，我要让他见识一下真正的飞行员是怎么做的！”

Kaji smirked as Asuka stomped off to her room. His plan of setting up a rival as motivation for the Second Child seemed to start off well.  
加持看着明日香跺脚走向她的房间，嘴角勾起一抹微笑。他设想的通过引入竞争对手来激励二号机驾驶员的计划似乎开局良好。

Gendo Ikari sat in the empty office alone, musing about the events that transpired today. _"No matter what you do, I want the Second Child out of it. I will help you with your scenario, under only this one condition," said Shinji in a stern voice, "no room for negotiation. Think what you would do for mother, father, then you'll know what I would do for her."_ He let out a sigh. If what he said was true…there's no need to threaten him with the Second Child anymore since he would do it himself. He knew Shinji knew what would happen if he was the one who broke their deal first.  
碇源堂独自坐在空荡荡的办公室里，沉思着今天发生的事情。“无论你做什么，我要二号机驾驶员退出。我会帮你实现你的计划，但只有一个条件，”真嗣用严肃的语气说，“没有商量的余地。想想你为了母亲、父亲会怎么做，你就会明白我为了她会怎么做。”他叹了口气。如果他说的是真的……那么就没有必要再用二号机驾驶员来威胁他了，因为他自己会去做。他知道真嗣明白如果他先违背协议会发生什么。

He still had to make sure - really sure - that Shinji was telling the truth.  
他仍然需要确认——真正确认——真嗣说的是真话。

Gendo smirked behind his clasped hands. With the help from his son - maybe he could finally see Yui again.  
源渡在他紧扣的双手后微微一笑。有了他儿子的帮助——也许他终于能再次见到唯了。

**Chapter 3: A Familiar Ceiling  
第三章：熟悉的天花板**

In all of the cycles he experienced, Misato's apartment had always been messy and grubby, full of garbage and empty beer cans. Shinji started cleaning the apartment the moment he got there; when he and Misato were splitting the chores, he intentionally lost most rounds of the rock-paper-scissors.  
在所有经历过的循环中，美里小姐的公寓总是凌乱肮脏，满是垃圾和空啤酒罐。真嗣一到那里就开始打扫；当他和美里分担家务时，他故意在大多数剪刀石头布的回合中输掉。

After all, he was the reason Misato died in his first life – his inaction had led to the death of two women he held the dearest. At least, doing the chores was something he was good at, and it did help soothe his guilt – only by a bit.  
毕竟，他在第一世中是导致美里死亡的原因——他的不作为导致了两位他最珍视的女性丧生。至少，做家务是他擅长的事，这确实有助于缓解他的内疚感——尽管只是微乎其微。

He thought the only way he could redeem himself was through complete avoidance of Third Impact, as well as the extermination of SEELE.  
他认为自己唯一能赎罪的方式就是彻底避免第三次冲击的发生，以及消灭 SEELE。

Shinji lay in the bathtub; the warm and soothing water did little to help alleviate his turmoil of thoughts. He had made a decision, and there's no turning back now. His father was surprisingly cooperative; maybe he saw part of himself in his son – a person who would do anything for his loved ones.  
真嗣躺在浴缸里，温暖舒缓的水流对他的思绪纷扰几乎无济于事。他已经做出了决定，现在没有回头路了。他的父亲出奇地配合；也许他在儿子身上看到了自己的影子——一个为了所爱之人愿意做任何事的人。

_'Like father, like son,'_ Shinji mocked himself. In retrospect, the reason he decided to help his father was simple but compelled. The Angels, unlike what SEELE and NERV had always thought, were never a serious problem – at least in most of his lives.  
“有其父必有其子，”真嗣自嘲道。回想起来，他决定帮助父亲的原因简单却强烈。使徒，与 SEELE 和 NERV 一直以来的认知不同，从未构成真正的威胁——至少在他大多数的人生中是如此。

SEELE was the final boss he had to deal with.  
SEELE 是他必须面对的最终 Boss。

In all of his previous lives, he had been using Unit 01 as a lever, trying to move the world. It never worked – the fact that he was lying here in the bathtub was the proof of that – because the Unit 01-lever wasn't strong enough. During the endgame between NERV and SEELE, Shinji had to fight all the MP EVAs with a damaged and barely-functioning NERV as his support.  
在他所有的前世中，他一直利用初号机作为杠杆，试图改变世界。但这从未奏效——他现在躺在浴缸里这一事实就是证明——因为初号机这个杠杆不够强大。在 NERV 与 SEELE 的最终对决中，真嗣不得不在受损且勉强运作的 NERV 支援下，与所有量产机战斗。

So, what if he chose to stand by his father's side from the very beginning, using his foreknowledge to help NERV become stronger, then maybe, just maybe, in the endgame, they could stand a chance-  
那么，如果他从一开始就选择站在父亲身边，利用他的先知先觉帮助 NERV 变得更强大，也许，只是也许，在最终决战中，他们能有一线生机——

There was still another wrinkle to his plan.  
他的计划中还有一个未解的难题。

His mother. 他的母亲。

In some of his former cycles, he and Asuka stood their ground fighting against the MP EVAs – just as they were about to win, Unit 01 would always awaken and summon the Lance of Longinus, no matter where it was. His mother _wanted_ Third Impact to happen – and he couldn't do anything about it.  
在他之前的某些循环中，他和明日香曾坚守阵地，与 MP EVA 战斗——就在他们即将胜利之际，初号机总会觉醒并召唤朗基努斯之枪，无论它身在何处。他的母亲希望第三次冲击发生——而他对此无能为力。

Shinji's train of thought screeched to a halt as a voice called out to him, "Shinji-kun! Don't spend too much time bathing! We're getting up early tomorrow!"  
真嗣的思绪戛然而止，一个声音向他喊道：“真嗣君！别泡澡太久！我们明天要早起！”

_'Okay, this is new,'_ Shinji frowned, "what for? I'm enjoying myself in here!" He had always been using the time of his first bath in Katsuragi Residence to collect his thoughts and form a plan about his new chance – it never got interrupted before.  
“好吧，这倒是新鲜，”真嗣皱眉道，“为什么？我在这儿正享受呢！”他向来利用在葛城宅邸的第一次沐浴时间整理思绪，规划新机遇——从未被打断过。

"We're going to pick up the Second Child from the airport!" Came Misato's cheerful voice.  
“我们要去机场接二号孩子！”美里欢快的声音传来。

Shinji blinked. This was new as well – they'd always meet each other on _Over the Rainbow,_ a ship that carried so many memories. He started panicking; on one hand, he wasn't sure this flap of wings of a butterfly would cause whether a tornado or a rainbow in their relationship. On the other hand, he had no idea how much an early addition of a pilot and an EVA Unit would change the Angel fights and the scenario.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。这也是新的情况——他们总是在“彩虹之上”号船上见面，那艘船承载了太多回忆。他开始慌乱；一方面，他不确信这只蝴蝶翅膀的扇动会在他们的关系中引发龙卷风还是彩虹。另一方面，他完全不知道提前加入一名驾驶员和 EVA 单位会如何改变天使战斗和整个局面。

He wasn't prepared for this variation, nor had he any idea of how this transpired.  
他没准备好应对这种变化，也不知道这一切是如何发生的。

"Oh," he answered offhandedly, immersed in his own thoughts. On second thought, it wasn't a bad thing; he could spend more time with Asuka – although he had already spent years, if not centuries with her – not to mention the addition of an EVA Unit could help a lot in battles. Ramiel had always been a formidable enemy.  
"哦，"他漫不经心地回答，沉浸在自己的思绪中。转念一想，这也不是件坏事；他可以花更多时间与明日香相处——尽管他已经与她共度了数年，如果不是数百年的话——更不用说增加一台 EVA 单位能在战斗中提供很大帮助。雷米尔一直是个强大的敌人。

"C'mon, show some attitude!" Ah, _Misato's_ voice was always pleasant to hear – not so much for _Captain_ or _Major Katsuragi_. "The Second Child's a girl! She's a real looker, long red hair that shines in the sun, brilliant blue eyes, and her bust…hmmm, you should totally see her in a plug suit," she finished with a teasing remark.  
"快点，展现点态度！"啊，美里小姐的声音总是那么悦耳——对葛城上尉或大佐来说就不那么美妙了。"二号机驾驶员可是个女孩！她真是个美人，长长的红发在阳光下闪耀，明亮的蓝眼睛，还有她的胸围……嗯，你绝对应该看看她穿插入栓服的样子，"她以一句调侃的话结束了这段描述。

_'Oh Misato, I've seen her much more than that,'_ Shinji mentally chuckled, "Alright Misato, if you say so." He stood up from the bathtub and flushed the water.  
'哦，美里，我见她的次数可比你想象的要多得多，'真嗣在心里暗笑，"好吧，美里，既然你这么说。"他从浴缸中站起身，放掉了水。

"Ha you little pervert!" Misato blabbed happily, satisfied that she always had a way to get the male species psyched up.  
“哈，你这个小色鬼！”美里开心地嚷嚷着，满意地觉得自己总有办法让男性兴奋起来。

The airport was exceedingly crowded; it's expected since the recent Angel Attack was undoubtedly scary, people were fleeing the city. Shinji sighed as he realized another problem of Asuka's early introduction to the pilot roster.  
机场异常拥挤；这可以理解，因为最近的使徒袭击无疑很可怕，人们都在逃离这座城市。真嗣叹了口气，意识到让明日香提前加入驾驶员名单的另一个问题。

Rei Ayanami. 绫波零。

Before, Shinji would try to bring Rei out of her shell before Asuka arrived, so they could have a…less strained relationship. Shinji knew why Asuka hated Rei so much. The indifference of Rei's attitude toward her reminded her of the doll – Asuka told him her darkest memories in his second chance. So all he needed to do was to make Rei more responsive to the outside world – or at least teach her to act like one.  
以往，真嗣总会在明日香到来之前设法让丽走出她的壳，以便他们能有一个……不那么紧张的关系。真嗣明白明日香为何如此憎恨丽。丽对她的冷漠态度让她想起了那个玩偶——明日香曾在他的第二次机会中向他吐露了她最黑暗的记忆。因此，他需要做的就是让丽对外界更加敏感——或者至少教会她表现得像一个正常人。

His plans worked well – in most of his former lives those two became good friends.  
他的计划通常很奏效——在他前几世的大多数时间里，这两个人成了好朋友。

However this time he didn't have the chance. Fortunately – he felt bad about thinking like this – Rei was still in the hospital recovering from the injuries she received from the last harmonic test, so he still got time to brace Asuka for it.  
然而这次他没有机会了。幸运的是——他觉得这样想有些不好——丽仍在医院里从上次谐波测试中受的伤中恢复，所以他还有时间让明日香做好准备。

_'Speak of the devil…'_ Shinji thought in amusement as a familiar voice came to him. "Hullo Misato! How have you been?"  
'说曹操，曹操到……' 真嗣心中暗笑，一个熟悉的声音传入耳中。"嗨，美里！你最近怎么样？"

He prepared himself for the encounter. He straightened up his pilot's uniform – a standard NERV uniform with a breastpin that had 'EVA-01' imprinted on it, an outfit he specifically required from his father. A good, yet impactful first impression was always important.  
他准备好迎接这次会面。他整理了一下自己的驾驶员制服——这是一套标准的 NERV 制服，胸针上印有'EVA-01'字样，这是他特意向父亲要求的。一个好的、有影响力的第一印象总是很重要的。

"Hello, Asuka! Oh my god you've grown a lot since the last time I saw you!"  
“你好，明日香！哦，天哪，自从上次见面以来，你长高了不少！”

"Of course! And my figure filled out as well!" An arrogant voice replied.  
“当然！我的身材也变得更好了！”一个傲慢的声音回答道。

Shinji raised his head and looked in the direction of the voice. There she was – wearing a yellow sundress and the ever-present A-10 clips, accompanied by two Section 2 Agents – but there's no sign of Kaji. Shinji frowned; this might be another significant variance.  
真嗣抬起头，朝声音的方向看去。她就在那里——穿着一件黄色太阳裙，戴着那标志性的 A-10 发夹，身边还有两名第二分部的特工——但并没有看到加持先生的身影。真嗣皱了皱眉；这可能又是一个重大的差异。

"So, let me introduce you, she is the Second Child, the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02, Asuka Langley Soryu!"  
“那么，让我来介绍一下，她是第二适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员，惣流·明日香·兰格雷！”

Asuka put her hands on her hips, a cocky smirk on her face. Her entire posture radiated a sense of superiority and conceit. She then settled her eyes on Shinji.  
明日香双手叉腰，脸上挂着得意的笑容。她的整个姿态都散发着一种优越感和自负。随后，她的目光落在了真嗣身上。

Asuka looked him up and down, narrowing her eyes, before frowning in disapproval, "so _this_ is the Third Child?" She said the name like it was the name of an expired food on a shelf. "Say, when do I get one of these?" She turned her head to Misato, pointing her finger at Shinji's breastpin.  
明日香上下打量着他，眯起眼睛，然后皱眉表示不满，“这就是第三适格者？”她说起这个名字就像是在说货架上过期的食品。“我说，我什么时候能得到一个这样的？”她转向美里，用手指着真嗣的胸针。

"You'll get one as soon as we settle you down, ya know, procedures stuff," Misato replied. Asuka grumbled an acknowledgment and continued checking Shinji out. "Hmph, he's not much to look at is he?" Her tone was condescending and intentionally irritating, as if she was challenging the person before her to bite her.  
“等你安顿下来，我们就会给你一个，你知道的，程序上的事，”美里回答。明日香咕哝着表示知道了，继续打量真嗣。“哼，他也没什么好看的，不是吗？”她的语气带着轻蔑和故意挑衅，仿佛在挑战眼前的人来反驳她。

"Then why are you still looking?"  
“那为什么你还在看？”

There were several reasons why he said what he said. On one hand, he _was_ irritated, mainly because he was not used to her attitude – the very same girl was calling him 'darling' and making love to him just more than a week earlier. On the other hand, standing up to Asuka's assaults – not mindlessly – was one way to get her respect. Shinji was not an expert in dealing with _girls_, but no one dared to claim the first place if he claimed to be the second-to-best handling _Asuka._ He had lifetimes of experience on the subject matter, after all.  
他说那番话有几个原因。一方面，他感到恼火，主要是因为他不习惯她的态度——就在一周多以前，这个女孩还叫他‘亲爱的’，与他缠绵。另一方面，面对明日香的攻击——不是盲目地——是赢得她尊重的一种方式。真嗣在处理女孩子方面不是专家，但如果他说自己是第二好的，没人敢自称第一。毕竟，他在这一课题上有无数次的经验。

On the third hand, when he looked back to all of his previous lives, no matter how he acted around the redhead, they would always get together, as long as he didn't reject or avoid her. In fact, his first life was the worst that had happened between them; acting wimpy or confident only affect how fast they became together, not the outcome. It was then he realized why they were attracted to each other – their childhood traumas. Their lives were so similar in so many ways that they might as well be two sides of the same coin. Therefore, Shinji decided that he could at least have a bit of fun bickering with the girl he loved.  
另一方面，当他回顾自己所有的前世时，无论他对红发女孩如何表现，只要他不拒绝或回避她，他们最终总会走到一起。事实上，他们之间最糟糕的一次是在他的第一世；无论是表现得懦弱还是自信，只会影响他们在一起的速度，而不是结果。那时他才意识到他们为何相互吸引——他们的童年创伤。他们的生活如此相似，以至于可以说是同一枚硬币的两面。因此，真嗣决定至少可以和他爱的女孩斗斗嘴，找点乐子。

Just like he expected Asuka's smirk grew wider. He silently blessed the fact that there couldn't be gust-winds inside an airport terminal. _"Say, how did he get chosen to be a pilot? I really can't tell. I bet it's nepotism. Such a daddy's boy."_ She said to Misato in German.  
正如他所料，明日香的冷笑变得更明显了。他默默庆幸机场航站楼里不可能有阵风。“说起来，他是怎么被选为驾驶员的？我真看不出来。我打赌这是裙带关系。真是个爸爸的乖儿子。”她用德语对美里说。

The Captain frowned disapprovingly, "Now Asuka, it's not nice-"  
上尉不满地皱起眉头，“现在，明日香，这可不好——”

_"I hate my father, A-Miss Soryu,"_ Shinji replied in a polite yet stern voice, _"he abandoned me when I was four, just after my mother died. So, don't you ever joke about it,"_ his German was almost flawless.  
“我恨我的父亲，Soryu 小姐，”真嗣用礼貌但坚定的语气回答，“他在我四岁时抛弃了我，就在我母亲去世后不久。所以，请不要拿这件事开玩笑，”他的德语几乎无可挑剔。

Asuka blinked – whether caused by his German or the content of his speech, no one knew. Perhaps both. Her eyes flashed several emotions – surprise, anger, pain, empathy – all in a fraction of a second.  
明日香眨了眨眼——不知是因为他的德语还是他话中的内容，无人知晓。或许是两者兼有。她的眼中闪过多种情绪——惊讶、愤怒、痛苦、同情——都在一瞬间。

Shinji almost regretted acting so harshly on Asuka. His goal, from getting together with Asuka as soon as possible at first, to the more recent 'I just want to make her happy', to 'I just don't want to see her get hurt again' – the very reason he decided to help his father under the condition that he would never hurt her. When Shinji fought his father, he would always use the Second Child to blackmail him, and it usually ended with her getting hurt, or even killed. He just couldn't take it anymore.  
真嗣几乎后悔对明日香如此严厉。他的目标，从最初尽快与明日香在一起，到最近的‘我只是想让她快乐’，再到‘我只是不想再看到她受伤’——这正是他决定在父亲不伤害她的条件下帮助父亲的原因。每当真嗣与父亲对抗时，他总是用第二适格者来要挟他，结果往往是她受伤，甚至丧命。他再也忍受不了了。

Thus, he felt terrible causing Asuka discomfort – but she needed it. _They_ needed it.  
因此，他感到让明日香不舒服非常糟糕——但她需要这样。他们都需要这样。

Still, he decided he should play nice from now on. "Sorry, forget I said anything. I'm Shinji Ikari, nice to meet you." He stuck out his hand.  
尽管如此，他决定从现在开始表现得友好些。“抱歉，当我没说。我是碇真嗣，很高兴见到你。”他伸出手。

Asuka pondered for a moment before sticking out her own hand, "I am the great Asuka Langley Soryu, pilot of Unit 02 and the Second Child." She shook his hand out of courtesy, but not without a curious look in her eyes.  
明日香沉思片刻后也伸出手，“我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，02 号机驾驶员，第二适格者。”她出于礼貌握了握他的手，但眼中带着一丝好奇。

Maybe the Third Child was not so dull, after all. _"So, you speak German, you know, the greatest language worldwide."_ Asuka smirked, _"good. At least someone's educated, being a subpar rookie pilot and all that."_  
或许第三适格者终究并不那么迟钝。“所以，你会说德语，你知道的，世界上最伟大的语言。”明日香轻蔑地笑了笑，“不错。至少还有人受过教育，尽管只是个二流的新手驾驶员。”

Shinji prepared a retort but Misato cut him off, "now, now Asuka, he's got the highest sync rate among the three of you," she was obviously a little displeased by the redhead's attitude, "and he's also got the most experience in _real_ combat."  
真嗣正准备反驳，但美里打断了他，“好了，好了明日香，他的同步率在你们三人中是最高的，”她显然对红发少女的态度有些不悦，“而且他在实战中的经验也是最丰富的。”

Shinji silently cursed as Asuka's glare, which had started to weaken, was suddenly reinforced to a level that Shinji suspected would have vaporized Ramiel. However, this was not the moment to back off. "But I've got the most training! I bet he just got lucky!" Asuka barked, "I've seen the footage, he fought the Angel like he was in a street fight or something! I'll show him how a _real_ pilot does it!"  
真嗣暗自咒骂，明日香的目光原本已经开始减弱，此刻却突然增强到了真嗣怀疑足以蒸发雷米尔的程度。然而，这不是退缩的时候。“但我训练最多！我敢打赌他只是运气好！”明日香咆哮道，“我看过录像，他跟使徒打斗的样子就像在街头打架一样！我会让他看看真正的飞行员是怎么做的！”

"Misato…is she always so…" Shinji cautiously chose his next words, knowing one wrong step, the next moment he'd probably be staring at the telephone booth again. Walking on a fine line when bickering with the Second Child was always fun; he had already mastered how to get under her skin while receiving minimal damage. "Competitive?" He was totally tempted to say 'childish', but he caught the word just before it came out of his mouth.  
"美里…她总是这么…" 真嗣小心翼翼地挑选着下一句词，深知一步走错，下一刻可能又要面对电话亭了。与二号机驾驶员争吵时总是如履薄冰，但他已经掌握了如何在激怒她的同时减少自身伤害。"好胜吗？" 他差点脱口而出'幼稚'，但就在话出口前及时收住了。

"This _is_ a competition, _Third,_" Asuka locker her gaze with her challenger, "and I _will_ beat you."  
"这是比赛，三号，" 明日香紧盯着她的对手，"我会打败你。"

"My name is Shinji, not Third, use it," Shinji shot back.  
"我叫真嗣，不是三号，用我的名字，" 真嗣回敬道。

"You still have to _earn_ that privilege from me," Asuka narrowed her eyes.  
"你还得从我这儿赢得那个特权呢，" 明日香眯起了眼睛。

"Alright then, _Second_," Shinji sneered, a clear amusement in his voice – contrasted by his crazily pounding heart along with the thought of _'Crap I'm gonna die the next second…'_  
"好吧，二号机驾驶员，" 真嗣嘲讽道，声音中明显带着戏谑——与他疯狂跳动的心脏和脑海中'糟糕，下一秒我就要死了……'的想法形成鲜明对比。

Asuka slapped him. Hard. 明日香狠狠地扇了他一巴掌。

"Don't make me destroy you," she growled, stepping past Shinji, deliberately bumping his shoulder with hers. Misato just stood there with an unreadable expression, completely ignoring her responsibilities.  
"别逼我毁了你，"她咆哮着，从真嗣身边走过，故意用肩膀撞了他的肩膀。美里只是站在那里，脸上毫无表情，完全忽视了自己的职责。

Shinji rubbed his cheek and smirked.  
真嗣揉了揉脸颊，咧嘴一笑。

"Roter Teufel." "红魔。"

"Can you believe that jerk?!" Misato snarled, slamming her foot on the throttle. After they dropped the Second Child at NERV Headquarters she and Shinji soon headed to a hill for a walk; Misato showed him the magnificent sight of Tokyo-3, a scene he had already beheld countless times. "I wasn't even as fast as last time I went through that checkpoint! How dare he fine me for it!"  
"你能相信那个混蛋吗？！" 美里咆哮着，猛踩油门。在将明日香送到 NERV 总部后，她和真嗣很快前往一座小山散步；美里向他展示了东京-3 的壮丽景象，这是他已无数次目睹的场景。"我甚至没有上次通过那个检查站时那么快！他怎么敢因此罚我！"

"Sure can't," Shinji replied.  
"当然不能，" 真嗣回答道。"

"I really want to grab him by his throat, and just strangle him!" The lavender-haired woman simulated the motion as she choked the steering wheel in front of her.  
"我真的想抓住他的脖子，然后狠狠地掐死他！" 这位紫发女子模拟着动作，紧紧地掐着面前的方向盘。"

"Mhmm." "嗯嗯。"

"Are you even listening to me?!"  
"你到底有没有在听我说话？！"

"Just crazy. Hu…" Shinji stopped himself and went wide-eyed as he met with his guardian's glare. "Sorry, Misato. I…" He expected Katsuragi to begin to unleash her fury on him, but instead her livid expression seemed to slowly morph into that of a schoolgirl who just learned a big secret. "Oh, I know what it is." Shinji was too familiar with the sound of her overly cutesy tone. "You're thinking about Asuka, aren't you?" She giggled as she pointed the finger at him teasingly.  
"只是有点疯狂。呼……" 真嗣止住了话头，当他迎上监护人的目光时，眼睛瞪得大大的。"对不起，美里。我……" 他本以为葛城会开始对他发火，但她的愤怒表情似乎慢慢变成了一个刚得知大秘密的女学生的样子。"哦，我知道是什么了。" 真嗣对她的过度可爱的语调再熟悉不过了。"你在想明日香，对吧？" 她咯咯笑着，用手指逗弄地指着他。

"No!" He retorted; the truth was he _was_ thinking about Asuka, however her assumption that Shinji had a crush on her couldn't have been farther from the truth.  
"不！" 他反驳道；事实上，他正在想着明日香，然而她认为真嗣对她有爱慕之情，这完全与事实不符。

"Uh huh." She winked and nudged her elbow up against him. "Sure you're not."  
"嗯哼。" 她眨了眨眼，用肘部轻轻碰了他一下。"当然不是。"

Shinji rolled his eyes. "It's…not like that."  
真嗣翻了个白眼。"事情……不是那样的。

"Oh, then what is it then?"  
"哦，那它到底是什么呢？"

"She's well…" He stopped, trying to find a word more neutral. "She's really irritable."  
"她很好……" 他停顿了一下，试图找到一个更中性的词。"她真的很容易生气。"

"But at least she talked to you."  
"但至少她跟你说话了。"

The young pilot cocked his head and raised an eyebrow. "So?"  
年轻的飞行员歪了歪头，挑起眉毛。“所以呢？”

"She _challenged_ you, Shinji," Misato grinned smugly, "she never challenges anybody unless she deems you at least at the same level as her. Or, she treats you as a worthy opponent."  
“她向你发起了挑战，真嗣，”美里得意地笑着，“她从不轻易挑战任何人，除非她认为你至少与她水平相当。或者说，她把你视为一个值得的对手。”

"Really?" He replied. "Could of fooled me." Of course Shinji knew what it meant for Asuka to challenge him. He just didn't want to let people know he could read her like a book; it might raise dangerous suspicions. He had no plan of letting anyone else, at least not yet, learn about his true identity other than his father.  
“真的吗？”他回应道。“差点让我信以为真。”当然，真嗣明白明日香向他挑战的含义。他只是不想让别人知道他能看透她，这可能会引起危险的猜疑。他无意让其他人，至少目前还不打算，了解他的真实身份，除了他的父亲。

The blue RA130 parked into the parking lot with an elegant J-turn. Shinji got off the car; his eyes widened as he saw a DHL delivery truck parked not far from them.  
蓝色的 RA130 以一个优雅的 J 型转弯驶入停车场。真嗣下了车，他的眼睛因看到不远处停着一辆 DHL 快递卡车而睁大了。

It could only insinuate one thing.  
这只能暗示一件事。

Why would she be here already?  
她怎么会已经在这里了？

He rushed to the elevator, not waiting for Misato – who was busily shutting off the engine and sorting out her own stuff - at all. With a _Ding_ the elevator door opened, he dashed outside and ran to Misato's apartment.  
他急忙冲向电梯，完全没有等正在忙着关闭引擎和整理自己东西的美里。随着“叮”的一声，电梯门打开，他冲出门外，直奔美里的公寓。

"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!" He cried as he was greeted by the too familiar scene. Numerous large storage boxes stacked on top of each other, completely stuffing the spare room of the apartment.  
“这他妈是什么鬼？！”他一进门就被这再熟悉不过的景象吓了一跳。无数大大小小的储物箱堆叠在一起，将公寓的空房间塞得满满当当。

"That's my stuff you sleazebag," an irritated voice came to him. Following the voice, Shinji found the Second Child sipping down some kind of drink, wearing a blue t-shirt and purple short shorts. And of course, those A-10 clips stood out on her head.  
“那是我的东西，你这个无赖，”一个恼怒的声音传来。顺着声音，真嗣发现明日香正喝着某种饮料，穿着蓝色 T 恤和紫色短裤。当然，她头上的 A-10 发夹依然显眼。

"What're you doing here?" He was genuinely surprised; she'd always moved in after their initial fight with Israfel for their sync training, because there are no other plausible reasons to put two high-on-hormones teenagers in the same apartment.  
"你在这里做什么？" 他真的感到惊讶；她总是在与伊斯拉斐尔的初次战斗后搬进来进行同步训练，因为没有其他合理的理由将两个荷尔蒙旺盛的青少年放在同一间公寓里。

"What do you think, idiot? You've obviously been replaced by the new model." She smirked superiorly and walked closer, invading Shinji's personal space, "Misato will be living with me. That's a more logical choice when you consider my superior piloting abilities."  
"你觉得呢，傻瓜？你显然已经被新模型取代了。" 她得意地笑了笑，走近一步，侵入了真嗣的个人空间，"美里会和我一起住。考虑到我更出色的驾驶能力，这是个更合理的选择。

"Really?" Shinji let out a relieved sigh with a hint of happiness, "thank God." _'You wanna play this game? Then so be it!'_  
""真的吗？" 真嗣松了一口气，带着一丝喜悦，"谢天谢地。" '你想玩这个游戏？那就来吧！'

Asuka blinked, "wh-what?! You just… what's there to thank God for?!"  
明日香眨了眨眼，“什、什么？！你刚刚…有什么好感谢上帝的？！”

"I thought we had to live together or something," Shinji turned away from her, "where's my stuff?"  
“我以为我们得住在一起什么的，”真嗣转过身去，“我的东西呢？”

Asuka just stared at him incredulously. Shinji was…happy that he was _not_ living with someone as beautiful and hot as her? This couldn't be real. No male had ever been able to resist her charms before – except Kaji, a real man in her eyes. She thought every boy at his age would kill for such an opportunity - an opportunity she kept for Kaji only.  
明日香难以置信地盯着他。真嗣居然…对不住在她这样美丽火辣的人身边感到高兴？这不可能是真的。以前从没有一个男人能抵挡住她的魅力——除了加持，在她眼里那才是真正的男人。她以为每个像他这个年纪的男孩都会为了这样的机会而疯狂——一个她只留给加持的机会。

He must be gay to say that.  
他说那话肯定是同性恋。

"What's going on there?" Misato's voice came to them, "oh hi Asuka, I thought you'd come later." She narrowed her eyes as she saw Asuka's shocked expression. She'd never seen her so bewildered before – the girl was always confident, if not arrogant.  
"那边怎么了？" 美里的话音传来，"哦，嗨，明日香，我以为你会晚点来。" 她眯起眼睛，看到明日香震惊的表情。她从未见过她如此茫然——这个女孩总是自信满满，如果不是傲慢的话。

"So, I hear you're kicking me out," Shinji said with a smirk on his face, enjoying the priceless expression on Asuka's face.  
"所以，我听说你要赶我走，" 真嗣脸上带着一丝得意的笑容说道，享受着明日香脸上那无价的表情。

"No, no one's getting kicked out," Misato replied with a slightly confused voice, "you're living together in my house."  
"不，没人会被赶出去的，" 美里略带困惑地回答，"你们要一起住在我家。"

"WHAT?!" Both teenagers shouted, albeit for entirely different reasons, "Boys and girls can't live together after the age of seven!" / "I still want to see tomorrow's sun!" Asuka/Shinji cried.  
"什么？！" 两个少年少女同时喊道，尽管原因完全不同，"七岁以后男孩和女孩就不能住在一起了！" / "我还想看到明天的太阳！" 明日香/真嗣喊道。

"The forecast says it'd be raining tomorrow anyway," _Misato_ said half-jokingly, before turning into a serious expression, "look, you're fellow pilots, so I want you to learn how to communicate with each other. It'll be beneficial in combat," said _Captain Katsuragi._  
"天气预报说明天会下雨，" 美里半开玩笑地说，然后表情转为严肃，"听着，你们是同僚驾驶员，我希望你们学会相互沟通。这在战斗中会有益处，" 葛城上尉说道。

"Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Shinji said in indignation.  
“你为什么不早点告诉我？”真嗣愤愤地说。

"I was hoping this to be a surprise," Misato stuck out her tongue, to which Shinji groaned, "to be honest, I was also a little startled by it at first. Still, it's a direct order from the Commander."  
“我本来想给你个惊喜的，”美里吐了吐舌头，真嗣则叹了口气，“说实话，我一开始也有点惊讶。不过，这是司令的直接命令。”

Asuka grumbled something inaudible and shot Shinji a glare before turning to sort out her belongings. Shinji stood there with a turmoil of thoughts in his head. It's not like he didn't think about asking his father to make the arrangement, but he squashed the idea as soon as it came to him. For one, he knew sooner or later they _would_ be living together, so he's not worried about it. For another, he didn't want to actively force Asuka to do something she probably wouldn't want to do; it's not fair for her. Shinji just didn't have the heart to do it.  
明日香咕哝了一句听不清的话，瞪了真嗣一眼，然后转身整理自己的东西。真嗣站在那里，脑海中思绪纷乱。他并非没想过请求父亲安排这一切，但这个念头一冒出来就被他压了下去。一方面，他知道迟早他们会住在一起，所以并不担心。另一方面，他不想主动强迫明日香做她可能不愿意做的事；这对她不公平。真嗣就是不忍心这么做。

He loved her, after all.  
他毕竟爱她。

Still, he was surprised at how far his father was willing to go to…help him? That couldn't be right. His father never _helped_ him; he _manipulated_ him.  
尽管如此，他还是惊讶于父亲愿意走多远来…帮助他？这不可能对。父亲从未帮助过他；他操纵他。

Shinji shook the thoughts off, turning around, and headed to the kitchen. If his father had really issued the order, he might as well accept his good fortune – and make the most out of it.  
真嗣摇摇头，转身走向厨房。如果父亲真的下了命令，他不妨接受这份好运——并充分利用它。

Next chapter: school, Shamshel, and more significant changes. Stay tuned and leave a review!  
AN: 我知道这里的真嗣太 OOC 了，但他有足够的时间去改变，而且我一直觉得写一个与明日香对立的真嗣很有趣。下一章会晚些上传，因为我正在准备期末考试，考试在 6 月 12 日结束。暑假期间会有更多更新。下一章：学校，夏姆谢尔，以及更多重大变化。敬请期待并留下评论！

## *Chapter 4*: Chapter 4: A Hedgehog's Dilemma  
*第 4 章*: 第 4 章：刺猬的困境

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》

**Chapter 4: A Hedgehog's Dilemma  
第 4 章：刺猬的困境**

_'Center the target, pull the switch.'  
'瞄准目标，拉动开关。'_

Doctor Ritsuko Akagi, arguably the smartest person in NERV. She was a brilliant scientist, the head of Project E, and the chief consultant of the Evangelion weaponry department. Still, she couldn't help but frown a little as she witnessed the ranged weapon training of the Third Child.  
赤木律子博士，可以说是 NERV 中最聪明的人。她是一位杰出的科学家，E 计划的首席，也是福音战士武器部门的首席顾问。然而，当她目睹第三适格者的远程武器训练时，还是不禁微微皱起了眉头。

Don't get it wrong – he was doing great. In fact, a little bit too good considering his non-existent background knowledge in guns. Although he had some trouble handling the pallet rifle initially, it looked more like he failed intentionally. It looked like…he was acting to be a rookie.  
别误会——他表现得很好。事实上，考虑到他对枪械知识的一无所知，他的表现好得有点过头了。虽然他一开始在操作弹匣步枪时有些困难，但看起来更像是有意为之。他表现得……像是在装作新手。

It was not how fast he was able to familiarize himself with the weapon and the Evangelion weapon system that raised her suspicions. It was the way he handled the weapon that intrigued her – the micro-details, such as how he positioned his finger on the trigger or how he grabbed the rifle butt – those minor habits showed that he was definitely a veteran, not a newcomer.  
让她起疑的并非他迅速熟悉武器和 EVA 武器系统的能力，而是他使用武器的方式——那些微小的细节，比如他如何放置手指在扳机上，或是如何握住枪托——这些细微的习惯表明他绝对是个老手，而非新手。

Ritsuko shook it off, thinking she must've been paranoid. Nothing in his file indicated that he had ever touched a weapon before – he was closely monitored for most of his life. Events as significant as touching rifles would positively be emphasized in bold with an underscore in his files.  
律子摇了摇头，觉得自己可能多虑了。他的档案中没有任何迹象表明他曾接触过武器——他一生中的大部分时间都受到严密监控。像接触步枪这样重要的事件，档案中肯定会用粗体加下划线着重强调。

"C'mon, Third! It's just a rifle! It's kids' stuff! I could do this when I was only seven!" The Second Child's half-annoyed, half-amused voice came into the comm channel, "I can't wait to beat you in a simulator, this way you can know your place!" _'Beneath me,'_ was left unsaid, but everyone could hear it in her haughty tone.  
“来吧，三号！这不过是一把步枪！小孩子玩意儿！我七岁就能做到了！”二号适格者的半恼半笑的声音通过通讯频道传来，“我迫不及待要在模拟器中打败你，这样你就能知道自己的位置了！”‘在我之下’虽未明说，但她傲慢的语气中人人都听得出来。

Shinji chuckled internally since he knew his combat skills would eat hers alive; in most of his former lives, he would require NERV to give him additional training in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, to the extent that he could subdue a thug twice his size without so much as breathing. He stopped receiving the training several cycles ago since there wasn't really anything left for him to master. He reckoned he could use the time to spend more time with Asuka.  
真嗣暗自发笑，因为他知道自己的战斗技巧会让她望尘莫及；在他大多数的前世中，他需要 NERV 为他提供额外的近战格斗和武术训练，以至于他能够轻松制服一个比自己大两倍的恶棍而不喘一口气。由于没有什么可再精进的了，他早在几个周期前就停止了这些训练。他觉得可以利用这段时间多陪陪明日香。

Shinji pulled the trigger; the simulated Sachiel fell to the ground, raising a cloud of dust and dirt. "Good job, Shinji-kun," came Ritsuko's voice, "now since the Second Child insisted, we're going to connect her to the simulator as well, then you two can have a match." As she finished speaking a red Evangelion suddenly appeared in front of Shinji, its eyes carried an EVA-equivalent predatory gleam.  
真嗣扣动扳机；模拟的萨基尔倒地，扬起一片尘土。“干得好，真嗣君，”传来律子的声音，“既然二号适格者坚持，我们将她连接到模拟器上，这样你们俩就可以对战了。”她话音刚落，一架红色的 EVA 突然出现在真嗣面前，眼中闪烁着 EVA 特有的狩猎光芒。

"C'mon, Third! Let's see what you got!" came Asuka's excited voice, her EVA assumed a defensive posture.  
“来吧，三号！让我看看你的本事！”明日香兴奋的声音传来，她的 EVA 摆出了防御姿态。

Shinji furrowed his brows; Asuka was _never_ defensive, she should be attacking him relentlessly right now. "As-Soryu-san, I'd really like to see how a well-trained pilot like you attack her enemies. Acting defensive against a novice is…dishonorable," He provoked, smirking smugly.  
真嗣皱起眉头；明日香从不防守，她现在应该毫不留情地攻击他。“As-Soryu-san，我真的很想看看像你这样训练有素的飞行员是如何攻击敌人的。对一个新手采取守势是……不光彩的，”他挑衅道，得意地笑了。

Asuka's smirk turned into a frown, her eyes carried a murderous look. "You asked for it, bastard!" She growled, willing her simulated EVA dashing forward to the purple giant. She threw a fake punch to the side of its face, thinking to distract Shinji, then she would deliver a well-calculated uppercut with all her might, hoping to vent all her annoyance and irritation accumulated these days on the boy, who was also the very source of these emotions.  
明日香的微笑变成了皱眉，她的眼中带着杀气。“你自找的，混蛋！”她咆哮着，操控着模拟 EVA 向紫色巨人冲去。她朝它的脸侧虚晃一拳，想分散真嗣的注意力，然后她将全力打出一个精心计算的上勾拳，希望能把这几天积累的所有烦恼和愤怒都发泄在这个男孩身上，他也是这些情绪的源头。

Unfortunately, Shinji had already expected the assault. He sighed internally, _'she always uses the same strategy,'_ he thought with amusement. He paid no attention whatsoever to her fake punch; instead, he raised his arm, blocking her uppercut with ease, and delivered a sweep-kick to her lower leg. Surprised that Shinji somehow read through her mind and retaliated successfully, the moment of distraction made Asuka losing her balance under the powerful kick.  
不幸的是，真嗣已经预料到了这次攻击。他内心叹息，‘她总是用同样的策略，’他带着一丝趣味想道。他对她的虚晃一拳毫不在意；相反，他抬起手臂，轻松挡住了她的上勾拳，并朝她的下盘踢出一记扫堂腿。惊讶于真嗣竟然看穿了她的心思并成功反击，这一瞬间的分神让明日香在强力的一脚下失去了平衡。

The red EVA fell on its back, lying flat on the ground. Asuka yelped as the purple EVA crouched above her, using its weight to prevent her from getting up. She silently cursed, both in the shame that she lost to a rookie and the fear of the incoming pain.  
红色 EVA 仰面倒地，平躺在地上。明日香惊呼一声，只见紫色 EVA 蹲伏在她上方，利用体重阻止她起身。她心中暗骂，既因败给一个新手而感到羞愧，又因即将到来的疼痛而恐惧。

But it never came. 但疼痛却始终未至。

Inside the test plug, Shinji hyperventilated, his eyes went wide as visions flashed before his eyes.  
在测试驾驶舱内，真嗣呼吸急促，双眼圆睁，眼前闪过一幕幕幻象。

_They were on the beach, beside the red sea. The black moon hanged on the sky, a star-ring composed of human souls circled around the earth. Half of a giant white face lay on the horizon, its single eye stared at them blankly.  
他们站在红海边的沙滩上。黑色的月亮悬挂在天空，由人类灵魂组成的星环环绕着地球。地平线上躺着半张巨大的白色面孔，那只独眼空洞地凝视着他们。_

_He sat on the torso of a red-haired girl, she had bandages on her right eye and left arm. He was strangling her, and she caressed his face.  
他坐在一个红发女孩的躯干上，她的右眼和左臂缠着绷带。他正掐着她的脖子，而她抚摸着他的脸。_

Shinji froze in place as the vision struck him; initially Asuka wondered why he didn't continue his attack, but she soon shook it off and decided to utilize this perfect opportunity to counterattack. She kicked him in the groin area forcefully, causing Shinji to groan in pain, and hastily got up on her feet.  
真嗣被这景象惊得僵在原地；起初明日香不明白他为何没有继续攻击，但她很快抛开疑惑，决定利用这个绝佳机会进行反击。她用力踢向他的裆部，让真嗣痛苦地呻吟，随即迅速站起身来。

The purple EVA crouched on the ground like a fetus, unable to get up; Asuka momentarily felt bad about kicking him in the crotch so hard, but the ecstasy brought to her by victory flooded the guilt.  
那台紫色的 EVA 像胎儿一样蜷缩在地上，无法起身；明日香一时对刚才狠狠踢中他下体的举动感到些许内疚，但胜利带来的狂喜很快淹没了这份愧疚。

"Ha, look at you Third, how _pathetic_," she remarked, the extreme pomposity in her voice making several people on the bridge to cringe, "after all, proper combat skill beats brute force!"  
“哈，看看你，第三适格者，多可怜，”她嘲讽道，语气中的极度傲慢让桥上的几个人都皱起了眉头，“毕竟，真正的战斗技巧胜过蛮力！”

_He was lying on the floor.  
他躺在地板上。_

_Pathetic. 可悲。_

_Help me, Asuka! 帮帮我，明日香！_

_No._

The purple EVA jumped to its feet as Asuka continued berating its pilot. She blinked in surprise, her combat reflex kicked in and she immediately assumed a defensive posture. She was expecting him to kick her or punch her, thus it took her brain several seconds to fully register the sensation of pressure around her neck.  
紫色的 EVA 站起身来，而明日香继续责骂着它的驾驶员。她惊讶地眨了眨眼，战斗本能立刻让她摆出了防御姿势。她本以为他会踢她或打她，因此她的脑子花了好几秒钟才完全意识到脖子上的压迫感。

He was strangling her. 他在掐她的脖子。

Asuka wanted to yell, but the phantom sensation was too overwhelming. She wanted to fight back, but he was lifting her into the air, her feet barely touching the ground.  
明日香想大喊，但那种虚幻的感觉太过强烈。她想反击，但他把她举到了空中，她的脚几乎碰不到地面。

"Cut the connection! NOW!" Ritsuko watched the scene in horror as the vitals of both Children were going wild. Maya complied instantly and shut down the simulator.  
“切断连接！现在！”律子惊恐地看着两位驾驶员的生命体征疯狂波动。玛雅立刻照做，关闭了模拟器。

The overwhelming physical feeling was gone in an instant, but the mental effect caused by his actions would forever remain in Asuka's mind. She panted heavily, suppressing a surge of nauseousness, massaging her neck. "Cough! Wha-what's gotten into you, Shinji?" She muttered to herself, still hard to believe he just did what he did. She opened the video feed to Shinji's test plug, wanting to throw several creative curses at him; how dare he _choked_ her, in a _simulated_ fight?!  
"那股强烈的身体感觉瞬间消失，但他行为造成的心理影响将永远留在明日香的心中。她喘着粗气，强压下涌上来的恶心感，揉着脖子。“咳！什、什么鬼，真嗣？”她喃喃自语，仍难以相信他刚刚所做的一切。她打开真嗣测试插入栓的视频反馈，想要对他破口大骂；他怎么敢在模拟战斗中掐她？！”

Asuka started getting scared of him.  
明日香开始害怕他了。

The window popped up, Asuka immediately started, "Fuck you, Third! Are you a fucking man or not?! You degen-" she trailed off as she saw the expression on his face – the blank stares, the trembling of his body visible even through the video feed, and the complete unresponsiveness to the outside world.  
窗口弹出，明日香立刻开始骂道：“去你的，三号！你他妈算不算个男人？！你这个变态——”她话音未落，就看到了他的表情——空洞的眼神，即使在视频反馈中也能看到他身体的颤抖，以及对外界完全无动于衷。

She silently cursed and opened up a comm channel to the bridge, "what the fuck is going on with your jerk pilot?!" She demanded.  
她默默咒骂着，打开通讯频道联系舰桥，“你们那个混蛋飞行员到底在搞什么鬼？！”她质问道。

"Pilot Soryu, condition report," came Ritsuko's slightly worried voice.  
“飞行员 Soryu，状况报告，”Ritsuko 略带担忧的声音传来。

"My throat fucking sours, but otherwise okay," she replied, "answer my question, what's the bastard pilot up to?!"  
“我喉咙难受得要命，但除此之外还好，”她回答，“回答我的问题，那个混账飞行员在搞什么？！”

"Watch your language, pilot," Dr. Akagi said coldly, "that's not how you talk to you supe-"  
"注意你的言辞，驾驶员，" 赤城博士冷冷地说，"这不是你对上级说话的方式-"

"I just got fucking **strangled,** in case you didn't notice, _doctor_," Asuka growled, "I believe I have every fucking right to know what the hell happened!"  
"我刚刚被他妈的勒住了，如果你没注意到的话，医生，" 明日香咆哮道，"我相信我有权知道到底发生了什么鬼事！"

Ritsuko let out a long sigh, "from the readings he had a violent panic attack, severe PTSD even," she replied, "nothing concerning you-"  
律子长叹一口气，"从他的读数来看，他经历了一次剧烈的恐慌发作，严重的创伤后应激障碍，"她回答道，"这与你无关-"

"I FUCKING LIVE WITH HIM, DOCTOR!" Asuka was livid, roaring, "and I'm NOT coming near him, until you figure out how to keep his hands off my _throat!"_  
"我他妈的跟他住一起，医生！" 明日香怒不可遏，咆哮道，"在我知道怎么让他别再掐我脖子之前，我绝不会靠近他！"

Although Ritsuko was extremely annoyed by the redhead's attitude, she had to admit that Asuka had a point – a good point. "Alright Pilot Soryu, we'll demand answers from him after…he wakes up from his…current state."  
尽管律子对这位红发少女的态度极为不悦，但她不得不承认明日香说得有道理——一个很好的观点。"好吧，飞行员索吕，我们会在他……从目前的状态中醒来后，向他追问答案。"

"Which is?" Asuka questioned, her curiosity got into place.  
"什么状态？" 明日香追问道，她的好奇心被勾了起来。

"He's semi-conscious, his bodily functions are working, but he's barely responsive," Ritsuko explained, "we'll get him out of the test plug and bring him to medical wing. He should be lucid enough in a few hours. In the meantime you can do whatever you want." The LCL in her test plug drained and the hatch opened, "you're dismissed, pilot."  
"他处于半清醒状态，身体机能还在运作，但反应极其微弱，" 律子解释道，"我们会把他从测试插槽中移出，送到医疗翼。几个小时后他应该就能清醒了。在此期间，你可以做任何你想做的事。" 她测试插槽中的 LCL 液体排空，舱门打开，"你可以离开了，驾驶员。"

"Whatever." Asuka got out the entry-plug in one swift movement; she couldn't help but frown in confusion.  
"随便吧。" 明日香迅速从插入栓中出来，不禁皱眉，感到困惑。

_'Just what the fuck is going on with the Third Child?'  
'第三适格者到底是怎么回事？'_

Shinji could start hearing people talking as consciousness slowly returned to him. His eyes focused on the white ceiling above him, only having one thought in his mind.  
随着意识逐渐回归，真嗣开始能听到人们的交谈声。他的眼睛聚焦在头顶的白色天花板上，心中只有一个念头。

_'Ah…The Ceiling…' '啊……天花板……'_

He moaned in displeasure and tried to get up into a sitting position. "Ah, you're awake," came to him Ritsuko's voice, "are you lucid?" She asked.  
他不悦地呻吟着，试图坐起身来。“啊，你醒了，”传来的是律子的声音，“你清醒吗？”她问道。

"Argh…I feel like I had a bad nightmare," he replied, rubbing his forehead, "what happened? How did I end up here?" He asked, carrying a tinge of dread. The answer was probably not something he wanted to hear.  
"哎呀…我感觉像是做了个噩梦，"他揉着额头回答，"发生了什么？我怎么会在这里？"他带着一丝恐惧问道。答案可能不是他想听的。

"In simple terms, you lost your mind in the simulator," Shinji gritted his teeth, Ritsuko continued, "you attacked Pilot Soryu in a…censurable manner."  
"简单来说，你在模拟器里失控了，"真嗣咬牙切齿地说，律子继续道，"你以一种…不可原谅的方式攻击了驾驶员惣流。"

Shinji clenched his fists, having a good guess of what transpired. He must've relived his darkest moments again, potentially triggered by Asuka's behaviors or words. The severe PTSD had happened to him before. Although they were extremely fortuitous, each time he had it had a big impact on the people around him, as well as his own mental state. He always forgot what he did during his…outbursts, but the emotional burden remained.  
真嗣紧握双拳，大致猜到了发生了什么。他一定是再次经历了最黑暗的时刻，可能是被明日香的行为或言语触发的。这种严重的创伤后应激障碍之前也发生过。尽管每次都极为偶然，但每次发作都对他周围的人以及他自己的心理状态产生了重大影响。他总是忘记自己在…发作期间做了什么，但情感负担依然存在。

"What happened to Asuka? Is she okay?" He probed, couldn't help but carry a hint of worry in his voice, not unnoticed by the perceptive doctor.  
"明日香怎么了？她还好吗？" 他探问道，声音中不由自主地带着一丝担忧，这并未逃过那位敏锐医生的察觉。

"Pilot Soryu is…irritated and agitated, but suffered no physical damage," she reassured, "she's…anxious that we demand answers from you."  
"惣流驾驶员目前情绪烦躁且激动，但身体上并无损伤，" 她安慰道，"她……对于我们向你索要答案感到焦虑。"

"Figures…" Shinji sighed. Still, he was happy that no one got hurt – at least physically. "Well…I want to talk to her, privately. Where is she?"  
"意料之中……" 真嗣叹了口气。尽管如此，他还是很高兴没有人受伤——至少在身体上。"那么……我想私下和她谈谈。她在哪儿？"

"I'm afraid that's not going to happen," said Ritsuko, Shinji raised an eyebrow, "she clearly stated that we keep you away from her 'until you figure out how to keep his hands off my throat', that's what she said."  
"恐怕那是不可能的，" 赤木律子说道，真嗣挑了挑眉，"她明确表示要我们让你远离她，直到你'弄清楚如何让他不再掐我脖子'，她是这么说的。"

"Damn it…" Shinji silently cursed, albeit using more colorful language. Now he knew exactly what happened to her. How do you reconcile with someone you tried to strangle?  
"该死……" 真嗣默默咒骂，尽管用词更为激烈。现在他确切地知道她经历了什么。你该如何与一个你试图掐死的人和解呢？

"What do you remember?" Ritsuko inquired, taking notes on her notebook, "how did it happen?"  
"你记得什么？" 赤木律子询问道，边在笔记本上做笔记，"事情是怎么发生的？"

"I…I wasn't being myself."  
"我…我那时不是真正的我。"

"Well tell me something I don't know."  
"那告诉我点我不知道的事吧。"

"I…" Shinji pondered for several long seconds, cautiously deciding how much information he wanted to disclose, "I had a vision… it's the same in my nightmares," he stared at his right hand, his fingers clenched and unclenched, "there's a terrifying demon, an enemy, it wanted to kill me, so I had to kill it," he made up a lie. "Nothing was real, I…" he trailed off, waiting for a reaction.  
"我…" 真嗣沉思了好几秒，小心翼翼地决定要透露多少信息，"我做了一个预知梦…和我的噩梦一样，"他盯着他的右手，手指紧握又松开，"有一个可怕的恶魔，一个敌人，它想杀我，所以我不得不杀了它，"他编了一个谎话。"一切都不是真的，我…"他话没说完，等待着对方的反应。

Ritsuko frowned; her primary concern was Shinji's EVA piloting capacity, nothing else really bothered her. However, this seizure-like event, if it took place more often, would definitely introduce undesirable risks into battles. She needed to investigate more. "Had this ever happened before? If so, how often?"  
律子皱了皱眉；她主要关心的是真嗣的 EVA 驾驶能力，其他事情真的不太在意。然而，这种类似癫痫的事件，如果发生得更频繁，无疑会在战斗中引入不可预知的风险。她需要进一步调查。“这种情况以前发生过吗？如果有，频率如何？”

"Yes," Shinji's reply was immediate. Saying 'no' was probably a better idea, but knowing Ritsuko it wouldn't be that simple, "Just… it's so rare, in fact I can't even remember last time I had it."  
“是的，”真嗣立刻回答道。说“没有”可能是个更好的主意，但知道律子的性格，事情不会那么简单，“只是……非常罕见，实际上我甚至不记得上次发生是什么时候了。”

"Hm." Ritsuko adjusted her glasses, "it seems there's nothing wrong with you, the brain scan tells me nothing except you're perfectly normal," she retracted her notebook, "I'll issue you a clean bill of health. You can go home whenever you want." She left the room without another word.  
“嗯。”律子调整了一下眼镜，“看来你没什么问题，脑部扫描显示一切正常，”她收起笔记本，“我会给你一份健康证明。你想什么时候回家都可以。”她没再多说一句话就离开了房间。

Shinji let out a breath and got up from the bed. A quick glance at the clock told him it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon. He punched the pillow in frustration as he knew he possibly just royally fucked up he and Asuka's relationship, at least in short terms.  
真嗣吐出一口气，从床上起身。瞥了一眼时钟，告诉他现在是下午四点。他懊恼地捶打枕头，知道自己可能刚刚彻底搞砸了他和明日香的关系，至少短期内是如此。

He quickly changed his clothes and headed to the department.  
他迅速换了衣服，朝部门走去。

"Tadaima." Shinji announced as he entered the apartment, taking off his shoes, "it's not like I expect anyone to be home…" Misato would definitely have a bunch of paperwork to do after today's incident, and Asuka would probably start to avoid him – so he expected to be alone in home.  
“我回来了。”真嗣宣布着进入公寓，脱下鞋子，“我并不指望家里有人……”美里肯定有一堆文件要处理，因为今天的事件，而明日香可能会开始避开他——所以他预计家里会只有他一个人。

"Took you long enough," a familiar voice came to him from the living room, bringing him back to reality. He hurriedly went through the corridor and came to the living room, finding a certain redhead sitting on the couch, her eyes focused on a comic book in her hand.  
"你可真慢，"一个熟悉的声音从客厅传来，将他拉回现实。他匆忙穿过走廊，来到客厅，发现某个红发女孩正坐在沙发上，眼睛专注地盯着手中的一本漫画书。

"Soryu-san?" He carefully asked.  
"惣流小姐？"他小心翼翼地问道。

"S-stay there, don't come close to me," Asuka put down her manga and looked at him strangely, assuming combat stance, "you won't try to choke me again, Ja?"  
"别动，别靠近我，"明日香放下漫画，奇怪地看着他，摆出战斗姿态，"你不会再想掐我了吧，嗯？

"Erm, of course not! I'm sorry," he suddenly couldn't meet her in the eyes, his face blushing in embarrassment, all his newfound confidence from his countless lives notwithstanding. "Sorry, really-"  
“呃，当然不是！对不起，”他突然不敢直视她的眼睛，脸上因尴尬而泛红，尽管他在无数次生命中重获的自信也无法掩盖这一点。“对不起，真的——”

Asuka let out a huff, "good. Dr. Akagi told me about your condition. I'm hungry. Go make me dinner, and it better not be fish again." She was in a surprisingly good mood due to her not-really-a-victory-but-a-victory-nonetheless against the almighty Third Child today, added her success in cracking his shells – when he apologized, he was completely different from his usual strong personality. Even though a part of her mind was still afraid of him, Shinji's sudden submissive behavior soothed that fear for the moment. Not to mention it was the first apology she got from him, so it must be significant. She stretched, purposely showing more flesh than usual but not overexposing her body, waiting for his reaction.  
明日香哼了一声，“好。赤木博士告诉我你的情况了。我饿了。去给我做晚饭，最好不要又是鱼。”今天她意外地心情很好，虽然不是真正的胜利，但总算是赢了那位无所不能的第三少年，再加上她成功地击破了他的外壳——当他道歉时，他的性格与平时完全不同。尽管她心里仍有一部分害怕他，但真嗣突然的顺从行为暂时安抚了这种恐惧。更不用说这是她第一次从他那里得到的道歉，所以一定很重要。她伸展身体，故意展示比平时更多的肌肤但又不过分暴露，等待他的反应。

To her surprise, Shinji didn't even pay a little bit of attention to her stunt – he just smirked, his eyes exclusively focused on her face. It annoyed her that her feminine beauty seemed to have no effect on the mysterious Third Child.  
令她惊讶的是，真嗣甚至没有注意到她的举动——他只是微微一笑，目光完全集中在她的脸上。她感到恼火，她女性的魅力似乎对这位神秘的第三少年毫无影响。

What annoyed her even more was his words, "wait a second, I'm not your personal servant, you can't just order me around like that."  
更让她恼火的是他的话，“等一下，我不是你的私人仆人，你不能就这样随意使唤我。”

Asuka growled, "first, don't gimme this 'Soryu-san' bullshit, you're a fellow pilot, I guess you should just call me Asuka."  
明日香咆哮道：“首先，别跟我来这套‘Soryu-san’的废话，你也是个驾驶员，我看你就直接叫我明日香吧。”

"Okay, then you can just call me Shinji then." He smiled.  
“好吧，那你就叫我真嗣吧。”他微笑着说。

"Gott, we're still doing this?!" Asuka huffed, "look, it's a privilege to call me by my name, only a few people had earned that privilege from me, so consider yourself lucky, Third," she remarked, glaring at the boy.  
"天哪，我们还在玩这个吗？！" 明日香哼了一声，"听着，能叫我名字是一种特权，只有少数人从我这里赢得了这种特权，所以你该觉得自己幸运，三号，" 她瞪着男孩说道。

"But the way you say 'Third'…it sounds like you're calling a scum under your shoe, it makes me uncomfortable," Shinji shot back, "it's only fair for us to call each other equivalently, right?"  
"但你叫'三号'的方式……听起来像是在叫你鞋底下的渣滓，这让我不舒服，" 真嗣反驳道，"我们互相称呼得公平些，不是吗？"

"You're an idiot, alright," Asuka sighed in defeat, "Baka-Shinji it is." She added with a smirk.  
"你真是个白痴，好吧，" 明日香叹了口气，认输了，"笨蛋真嗣，就这么定了。" 她带着一丝得意的笑容补充道。

Shinji had to fight back the tears suddenly threatened to come out of the corner of his eyes. His loss of composure went unnoticed by the redhead, though, who was currently glancing at the clock, "c'mon! I made my compromise! Now go make me dinner!" During the weeks she and Shinji lived together, one thing about the Third Child pleased her – his impeccable cooking.  
真嗣不得不强忍住眼角突然涌出的泪水。不过，他的失态并未被红发少女察觉，她此刻正瞥着时钟，"快点！我已经妥协了！现在去给我做晚饭！"在与真嗣同住的这几周里，第三适格者有一个方面让她颇为满意——他无可挑剔的厨艺。

"But it should be your turn today," said Shinji who was in desperate need of a distraction.  
“但今天应该是轮到你做了，”真嗣迫切需要一个转移注意力的话题。

"Then consider it compensation for the incident today, alright?!" Asuka barked, getting impatient, "I haven't forgiven you yet, you know that?!"  
“那就当是今天那件事的补偿，行不行？！”明日香不耐烦地吼道，“我还没原谅你呢，你知道的吧？！”

Shinji's closed his mouth into a thin line. For one, he knew he was approaching Asuka's limit; for another, he really felt guilty about hurting the redhead he loved. "O-okay," he conceded and went to the kitchen.  
"真嗣紧闭双唇，形成一条细线。一方面，他知道自己正逼近明日香的极限；另一方面，他确实对自己所爱的红发女孩造成的伤害感到内疚。“好——好吧，”他让步道，走向厨房。”

Asuka watched him in satisfaction and grinned, tasting her small victory.  
"明日香满意地看着他，咧嘴一笑，品味着她小小的胜利。”

"I'm Asuka, Soryu Asuka Langley, charmed, huh?" A fake-friendly voice, carried a hint of superiority.  
"“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，很高兴认识你，哼？”一个假装友好的声音，带着一丝优越感。”

The whole class looked at the redhead intently, girls were jealous of her figure while the boys were drooling over her exotic beauty. A quick glance Shinji saw Toji sitting in the back row, just like he expected. He cleared his throat.  
全班同学都紧盯着那位红发女孩，女生们嫉妒她的身材，而男生们则对她异域风情的美貌垂涎三尺。草薙瞥了一眼，果然看到真嗣坐在后排。他清了清嗓子。

"I'm Shinji, Shinji Ikari, charmed, huh?" A high-pitched but definitely male voice, carried clear amusement and mockery.  
“我是真嗣，碇真嗣，幸会，嗯？”一个尖细但明显是男性的声音，带着明显的戏谑和嘲弄。

The whole class except Rei Ayanami blinked in befuddlement, so when a punch landed square in Shinji's face, the class remained silent for a moment, then burst out laughing.  
除了绫波零之外，全班同学都一脸困惑地眨了眨眼，所以当一拳正中真嗣的脸时，班级沉默了一瞬，随即爆发出哄堂大笑。

Asuka red-faced, her fist clenched so tight it gave an impression that it could break the air molecules in her palms, "for fuck's sake, THIRD," she roared at the boy who was currently lying on the floor, rubbing his bleeding nose, "I swear to God if you wanna see tomorrow's sun-"  
明日香满脸通红，拳头紧握到仿佛能捏碎掌中的空气分子，“看在老天的份上，第三次了，”她对着那个正躺在地上揉着流血鼻子的男孩咆哮，“我发誓，如果你想见到明天的太阳——”

"Asuka," Shinji covered his nose with his hand, standing up from the floor, his knees still wobble. He knew he risked a lot making fun of Asuka's trademark introduction. Still, he couldn't help but try it out because in **none** of his former lives they were introduced to Class 2-A side by side. It was just an opportunity too rare to pass – and the end result, as he well-expected and well-deserved, was physical violence from the redhead. "it sounds really stupid, especially in Japanese. I was just trying to show you that." In fact, it was far from stupid, he said it just to get under her skin.  
“明日香，”真嗣用手捂着鼻子，从地板上站起来，膝盖还在颤抖。他知道自己冒了很大的风险去模仿明日香的标志性开场白。尽管如此，他还是忍不住尝试了一下，因为在他的前几世中，他们从未一起被介绍给 2-A 班。这是一个太难得的机会——而结果，正如他所预料并应得的，是红发女孩的暴力相向。“这听起来真的很蠢，尤其是在日语里。我只是想让你明白这一点。”事实上，这远非愚蠢，他说这话只是为了激怒她。

The class was sent into another state of confusion as they watched their exchange. Did that babe know Ikari, since he was already on the first name basis? Why did she call him 'Third', did that mean he was her…third boyfriend, or something like that? If that's the case, why did she punch him, and why he seemed okay with such a degree of violence?  
教室里再次陷入一片混乱，学生们看着他们的互动。那个美女认识碇吗，既然他们已经直呼其名了？她为什么叫他‘第三’，这是否意味着他是她的……第三个男朋友，还是类似的意思？如果是这样，她为什么打他，而他似乎对这种程度的暴力毫不在意？

As waves of murmurs rippled through the classroom, Asuka stomped off the podium red-faced, pouting, after shooting Shinji a murderous glare. He followed closely behind, an apologetic expression mixed with a smirk on his face. The class representative came to them with a dutiful smile, "Hello, Ikari-kun, Soryu-san," she bowed a little, "I'm Hikari Horaki, the class representative. Please familiarize yourself with the school! If you have any problems just come and find me!"  
随着一阵阵窃窃私语在教室中蔓延，明日香满脸通红地从讲台上跺脚离开，噘着嘴，狠狠地瞪了真嗣一眼。他紧随其后，脸上带着歉意的表情，夹杂着一丝得意的笑容。班长带着尽责的微笑走向他们，“你好，碇君，惣流同学，”她微微鞠躬，“我是班长，光耀日香。请熟悉一下学校！如果有任何问题，尽管来找我！”

"No problem Horaki-san," Shinji politely replied before going to his seat. Asuka mumbled an acknowledgment and sat down two rows in front of him, despite the fact that almost the entire column was empty.  
“没问题，日香同学，”真嗣礼貌地回答，然后走向自己的座位。明日香咕哝了一声表示听到了，尽管整排几乎都空着，她还是坐在了他前面两排的位置。

Shinji opened his laptop and waited for the inevitable. Moments later he could hear murmurs in the back of the classroom started by Kensuke. Then his laptop flashed a notification. It read:  
真嗣打开笔记本电脑，等待着不可避免的事情发生。片刻后，他听到教室后排传来健介的窃窃私语。接着，他的电脑闪现了一条通知，上面写着：

_Is it true you're the pilot of that robot? Y/N  
你真的是那个机器人的驾驶员吗？是/否_

He raised his head, and saw Asuka looking back at him, a confused frown on her face. Shinji silently cursed as he realized this time the situation was drastically different. Having decided it would probably be a good idea to talk about it with Asuka first, he sent her a PM:  
他抬起头，看到明日香正回头看着他，脸上带着困惑的皱眉。真嗣默默地咒骂着，意识到这次的情况截然不同。他决定先和明日香谈谈可能是个好主意，于是给她发了一条私信：

_Shinji.I: You received the question too?  
真嗣.I：你也收到那个问题了？_

Asuka turned her head back to her laptop and started typing.  
明日香转过头回到她的笔记本电脑前，开始打字。

_Asuka L.S.: Yeah. 明日香 L.S.：嗯。_

_Shinji I.: How do we reply?  
真嗣一：我们该如何回复？_

_Asuka L.S.: The truth, of course.  
明日香·L·索瑟兰：当然是实话实说。_

_Asuka L.S.: I'll let whole school know I'm an elite pilot.  
明日香·L·索瑟兰：我要让全校都知道我是一名精英驾驶员。_

_General Chat Room 综合聊天室_

_Asuka L.S.: YES  惣流·A·明日香·兰格雷：没错_

Chaos emerged as basically every single student in the class stood up at once to talk to Asuka. Hikari stood up abruptly and headed towards the commotion to sort everything out. "Come on, you guys. Leave her alone!" Shinji looked up at Hikari gratefully as she gave him a small smile, before resuming her duties. "Sit down! We still have class you know!"  
混乱爆发，班上几乎每个学生都同时站起来找明日香说话。光突然站起来，朝骚动走去，试图平息一切。“拜托，你们别烦她了！”真嗣感激地抬头看着光，她对他微微一笑，然后继续她的职责。“坐下！我们还有课要上，你们知道吗！”

No one listened. Instead, Asuka got a barrage of questions regarding her pilot status, whether she knew how to be chosen, the EVA itself. Asuka was more than happy to brag about how you should be one-in-a-billion to be chosen as an EVA pilot, and how she had been training hard for most of her life. She was smirking proudly as all the attention around her fed her ego. Only a few students didn't stand to harass Asuka. Rei continued to stare out the window, Hikari continued to try to get everyone to calm down, to no avail, Kensuke glanced over, craning his neck to try and get any piece of interesting information from Asuka. Sensei didn't notice that his class was not paying attention, instead continuing to go on about Second Impact.  
无人倾听。相反，明日香被一连串关于她的驾驶员身份、如何被选中、以及 EVA 本身的问题轰炸。明日香非常乐意炫耀自己如何成为亿里挑一的 EVA 驾驶员，以及她如何为这一生的大部分时间刻苦训练。她得意地笑着，周围的关注让她的自信心膨胀。只有少数学生没有上前骚扰明日香。绫波继续凝视窗外，班长光子继续试图让大家冷静下来，却徒劳无功，剑介则伸长脖子，试图从明日香那里获取任何有趣的信息。老师并未注意到他的课堂无人专注，反而继续讲述第二次冲击的课程。

"Oh... That's all for today." Sensei said as a bell sounded, signifying the end of the class.  
“哦...今天就到这里。”随着铃声响起，老师宣布了课程的结束。

"Rise! Bow! Come on guys, at least show some manners at the end of class!" Toji watched the huddle from the back of the room with an unreadable expression on his face. He stood up from his seat and walked toward Asuka after the crowd dissipated. Shinji watched him with dread – if he was about to punch her, he was certain Toji's body would never be found.  
"起立！鞠躬！拜托各位，至少在课结束时表现得有礼貌些！" 真嗣从教室后方注视着那群人，脸上带着难以捉摸的表情。人群散去后，他从座位上站起来，走向明日香。真嗣紧张地看着他——如果他打算揍她，真嗣确信没人能找到东治的尸体。

"So you are the pilot of that giant robot?" He inquired as Asuka packed her stuff. The said girl turned to look at him with a hesitant expression, "um, I _am_ a pilot, but I wasn't piloting that day," she pointed the finger at Shinji, "he was."  
"这么说你就是那个巨大机器人的驾驶员？" 他询问道，而明日香正在收拾她的东西。这位女孩转过身来，带着犹豫的表情看着他，"嗯，我是驾驶员，但那天并不是我在驾驶，"她指向真嗣，"是他。"

Toji turned to Shinji abruptly and bowed deeply.  
东治突然转向真嗣，深深地鞠了一躬。

"Thank you, Ikari! You saved me and my sister's lives," he said in a grateful voice.  
"谢谢你，碇！你救了我和我妹妹的命，" 他用感激的声音说道。

"Um, it's nothing, really. I just got lucky." Shinji replied in his usual modest manner. Asuka huffed, "well, well, well, would you look at that," she scoffed sarcastically, "the almighty Shinji-sama being humble; the pigs might fly."  
"呃，真的没什么，我只是运气好。" 真嗣以他一贯的谦虚方式回答。明日香哼了一声，"好吧，好吧，你看看，"她嘲讽地嗤之以鼻，"伟大的真嗣大人居然谦虚起来了；猪都能飞上天了。"

Toji must've been disturbed by her attitude since a scowl appeared on his face, "what's wrong with you, red? Ikari saved my family, he deserved gratitude more than you!"  
可能是因为她的态度让剑介感到不安，他的脸上露出了不悦的表情，"你这是怎么了，红发？碇救了我的家人，他比你更值得感激！"

Asuka narrowed her eyes dangerously, "listen you dork-"  
明日香危险地眯起了眼睛，"听着，你这个呆子——"

"Both of you, STOP," Shinji interrupted forcefully. He knew too well what such exchanges would soon proceed into. He looked at Toji first, "look, Suzuhara, Asuka has been training for this for her whole life, and I'm sure she will save your, or everybody on earth's lives one day, if not several times," the redhead's expression softened as she heard the words. Shinji then turned to Asuka, "Asuka, he was just trying to be nice. And I'm _looking forward_ to you saving my life in battle one day, then I _will_ thank you properly."  
"你们两个，停下，" 真嗣强硬地打断道。他太清楚这种争执接下来会演变成什么。他先看向了阿薰，"听着，铃原，明日香为了这一天已经训练了一辈子，我相信她总有一天会救你，或者地球上所有人的命，哪怕不止一次，" 听到这些话，红发少女的表情缓和了下来。真嗣接着转向明日香，"明日香，他只是想表示友好。而我期待着有一天你在战斗中救我一命，到时我会好好感谢你。"

Asuka bit on her lips; why would the almighty Shinji-sama defend her? And why she wanted appreciation, or at least attention from him so badly? A moment later, a confident smirk crept up her face, "just you wait, Third. I _will_ save your sorry ass one day."  
明日香咬着嘴唇；为什么无所不能的真嗣大人会为她辩护？而为什么她如此渴望他的赞赏，或者至少是他的关注？片刻后，她脸上浮现出一丝自信的微笑，"等着瞧吧，第三适格者。总有一天我会救你那可怜的命。"

It was that moment Shinji felt the vibration in his pocket. He took out his phone at the same time Asuka did. The pilots looked at each other – this could only mean one thing. Rei Ayanami approached them, "Second Child, Third Child. We're needed at NERV. Please hurry." She left in swift movements without another word.  
就在那一刻，真嗣感觉到口袋里的震动。他和明日香同时拿出手机。两位驾驶员对视一眼——这只能意味着一件事。绫波零向他们走来，"第二适格者，第三适格者。我们需要前往 NERV。请快点。" 她迅速离开，没有再多说一个字。

Shinji turned to Toji, "listen, whatever you do, don't come out of the shelter," he began walking away while Asuka was already running down the hallway, "If you're so interested in the battle I could even get you tapes, just don't come out of the shelter." Seeing Toji nodded hesitantly, he sprang off as well, hoping his words could get into Kensuke's ears.  
真嗣转向了渡志，“听着，无论发生什么，都不要离开避难所，”他一边说着一边走开，而明日香已经跑向了走廊，“如果你对战斗那么感兴趣，我甚至可以给你录像带，只要别离开避难所。”看到渡志犹豫地点头，他也迅速离开，希望自己的话能传到健介的耳朵里。

Gendo Ikari's office had always been cold and dark; Shinji shivered a little upon entering, despite that he shouldn't be afraid of the person inside it anymore. Gendo's face hid behind his clasped hands, his eyes concealed by his orange glasses. This way no one could read him through his emotions. "Is there anything noteworthy to report, pilot?" He said, his voice cold, but not without a hint of curiosity.  
碇源堂的办公室总是阴冷而昏暗；真嗣一进去就微微颤抖了一下，尽管他不应该再害怕里面的人了。碇源堂的脸隐藏在他紧握的双手后面，他的眼睛被橙色眼镜遮住。这样，没有人能通过他的情绪读懂他。“有什么值得报告的事情吗，驾驶员？”他说道，声音冰冷，但带着一丝好奇。

"Yes, Commander," Shinji replied. The fourth Angel had always been an easy enemy since his second chance after he learned how to deal with the energy whips effectively, added the lack of distraction from Toji and Kensuke he could deal with the Angel of Morning without so much as a second breath. Asuka, of course, was both jealous and irritated that he got another solo Angel kill. There was one problem, though. "Back then, NERV extracted the S2 engine from the Fourth Angel and installed it on Unit 04. When they tested it, the engine exploded, taking Unit 04, Nevada branch, and thousands of lives along with it. So if you wanna do experiments on it that's fine, just… don't try to activate it. It'll end badly." Shinji had always felt the famous 'survivor's guilt' when he heard the news of Nevada Branch; he wanted to save the people there, but he couldn't do anything before – not if he didn't want to expose himself. This time he could finally do something about it – he could only hope his father would listen to him.  
“是，司令。”真嗣回答道。自从他学会如何有效应对能量鞭笞后，第四使徒便一直是个容易对付的敌人，再加上没有东治和剑介的干扰，他可以轻松应对晨曦使徒，几乎不费吹灰之力。当然，明日香对此既嫉妒又恼火，因为他又独自击败了一个使徒。但有一个问题。“那时，NERV 从第四使徒中提取了 S2 引擎并安装在四号机上。测试时，引擎爆炸，连带四号机、内华达支部以及成千上万的生命一同消失。所以如果你想对它进行实验，没问题，只是……别试图启动它。那会酿成大祸。”每当听到内华达支部的消息，真嗣总会感到那著名的“幸存者愧疚”；他想要拯救那里的人们，但之前他无能为力——除非他不想暴露自己。这次他终于能有所作为了——只希望父亲能听从他的劝告。

Gendo pondered for a moment. There's no way his son could know about NERV's plans on the mostly intact S2 engine; that's another undeniable evidence that his son was…somehow telling the truth. If what he said about the explosion was true as well, then it would be a great help to his scenario – one more working Evangelion was always welcomed. "I see. Is there anything else?"  
源堂沉思片刻。他的儿子不可能知道 NERV 关于基本完好的 S2 引擎的计划；这无疑是另一个不可否认的证据，证明他的儿子……不知怎么地在说实话。如果他关于爆炸的说法也是真的，那么这对他的计划将是一个巨大的帮助——再多一台可运作的 EVA 总是受欢迎的。“我明白了。还有别的吗？”

"Yes," Shinji continued, "tell Kaji Ryoji to transport Adam through air, not sea. There's an Angel in the Pacific Ocean. Or…the scenario could be devastated."  
“是的，”真嗣继续说道，“告诉加持良治通过空运而不是海运运输亚当。太平洋上有一只使徒。否则……计划可能会被摧毁。”

The explosion of _Over the Rainbow_ was something he never wanted to witness ever again.  
《彩虹之上》的爆炸是他再也不想目睹的场景。

"Hm." Gendo blinked as he heard his words, but soon regained his composure as he reminded himself that his son knew much more than he could ever imagine, so he might as well accept the fact. "I see. Anything else?"  
"嗯。" 听到自己的话，碇源堂眨了眨眼，但很快恢复了镇定，他提醒自己，儿子知道的远比他所能想象的要多，所以最好还是接受这个事实。"我明白了。还有别的吗？"

"No, nothing for now, sir."  
"没有了，目前没有，先生。"

"Good. Your information could really help." Gendo remarked, "dismissed."  
"很好。你的信息确实很有帮助。" 碇源堂说道，"解散。"

Shinji nodded and left the office. Minutes passed as Gendo waited for SEELE to start their meeting, a turmoil of thoughts in his mind. _'Should I listen to my son? Does he have his own…plans?'_ He kept his unwavering facial expression as twelve monoliths appeared around him.  
真嗣点点头，离开了办公室。几分钟后，碇源堂等待着 SEELE 开始他们的会议，心中思绪纷乱。'我应该听我儿子的吗？他有自己的……计划吗？'他保持着不变的面部表情，周围出现了十二座巨石碑。

"Ikari, what do you plan to do with the S2 engine of the Fourth Angel?" SEELE 01 started, "it could be useful to Evangelion technology."  
“碇，你打算如何处理第四使徒的 S2 引擎？”SEELE 01 开口问道，“它可能对 EVA 技术有用。”

Gendo mused for a moment before he spoke up, "I'll let Dr. Akagi run some simple test on it, then I shall decide."  
碇源堂沉思片刻后开口道：“我会让赤木博士先进行一些简单的测试，然后再做决定。”

"Fair enough." SEELE 03 remarked, "when will Unit 02 arrive?"  
"说得有理。" SEELE 03 问道，"二号机何时抵达？"

"The fleet is supposed to dock at New Yokosuka three days later. I'll send the Second Child and the Third Child to pick it up at the bay." Gendo replied.  
"舰队预计三天后停靠新横须贺。我会派二号适格者和三号适格者去码头接应。" 碇源堂回答道。"

"I see." SEELE 01 said, "keep the scenario in check, Ikari."  
"明白了。" SEELE 01 说，"控制好局面，碇。"

The monoliths disappeared; Gendo Ikari picked up the secured landline.  
那些巨石碑消失了；碇源堂拿起加密的座机电话。

"Kaji." A voice came from the speaker.  
"加治。" 扬声器中传来一个声音。

"Ikari." Gendo replied, "leave the fleet with the package immediately. I've already granted you the authorization to use any of the aircraft on the carrier. Land at NERV airport."  
"碇。" 源堂回答道，"立即带着包裹离开舰队。我已经授权你使用航母上的任何飞机。在 NERV 机场降落。"

"Roger." Kaji replied through the phone, his voice just carried a hint of disappointment.  
"收到。" 加持通过电话回答，语气中隐约带着一丝失望。

## *Chapter 5*: Chapter 5: Propinquity  
*第五章*: 第五章：亲近

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》

**Chapter 5: Propinquity 第五章：亲近**

"Baka-Shinji! Where is my lunch?" Asuka barked, slamming her hands on the table, her face leaned threateningly toward the poor boy, whose only fault was not fast enough to take out _two_ bentos from his school bag in _one_ second.  
"笨蛋真嗣！我的午餐呢？" 明日香厉声喝道，双手猛拍在桌子上，脸庞威胁性地逼近那个可怜的男孩，他的唯一过错就是没能在一秒钟内从书包里拿出两个便当。

Her unrestrained volume drew the attention of nearly everyone in the classroom; the class fell silent as people turned heads in their direction, frowning. Someone in the back row murmured a barely audible "Do they live together?"  
她那毫不掩饰的音量几乎吸引了教室里所有人的注意；班级陷入了沉默，人们纷纷转头看向他们，皱起了眉头。后排有人低声嘀咕了一句几乎听不清的“他们住在一起吗？”

"Um," Shinji sweatdropped under the questioning gazes of his classmates, silently cursing that Asuka grew too careless. He took out the bento and handed it to Asuka, who accepted with a huff and turned around to leave.  
“呃，”真嗣在同学们的审视目光下汗颜，暗自咒骂明日香太过大意。他拿出便当递给明日香，后者哼了一声接过，转身离去。

"Wait, Asuka," Shinji called out to the redhead, who looked back at him with a frown. "What is it?" She said annoyedly.  
"等等，明日香，" 真嗣对着那位红发女孩喊道，她回头皱眉看着他。"什么事？" 她不耐烦地说。

"You haven't met Rei properly yet, have you?" He asked. Although it was risky to let her meet Rei so early since he hadn't had a chance to…prepare Rei for the meeting yet, but he figured sooner than later Asuka would encounter Rei by herself – fortunately during yesterday's Angel Attack those two didn't have a chance to talk - and that would end badly. Therefore, he decided to take the initiative; this way he could at least act as a cushion if the meeting went too wrong.  
"你还没正式认识绫波吧？" 他问道。虽然这么早让她见绫波有些冒险，因为他还没来得及……为这次会面准备绫波，但他认为明日香迟早会自己遇到绫波——好在昨天的使徒袭击中她们俩没机会交谈——那将会很糟糕。因此，他决定主动出击；这样一来，他至少可以在会面出问题时充当缓冲。

"Rei? Oh, you mean the First Child?" She put a finger under her chin, "well, might as well introduce myself. I didn't have a chance yesterday." She grabbed Shinji's wrist and dragged him along, eliciting another wave of murmurs around the class.  
"绫波？哦，你是说那个第一适格者？" 她用手指托着下巴，"好吧，那就自我介绍一下。昨天没机会。" 她抓住真嗣的手腕，拉着他一起走，引得班上又是一阵窃窃私语。

The mid-day sun in Japan baked the earth and every creature that dared to come out of their shelters. Most students chose to have their lunches inside the building – a wise choice. Asuka had been complaining non-stop ever since they stepped out. "What a time you chose, Baka!" She poked at his ribs, eliciting a pained yelp from the boy.  
"日本正午的阳光炙烤着大地和每一个敢于走出避难所的生物。大多数学生选择在建筑物内用餐——这是个明智的选择。自从他们走出室外，明日香就一直在不停地抱怨。“你选的这是什么时间啊，笨蛋！”她戳了戳他的肋骨，引得男孩发出痛苦的叫声。”

"There she is," Shinji pointed at a blue-haired girl, who was sitting on a bench reading a book. As Asuka headed off in her direction, Shinji called out, "Asuka," the redhead looked back at him with a quizzical expression, "she's…not talkative, so don't get offended if she ignores you."  
“她在那儿，”真嗣指着一个坐在长椅上读书的蓝发女孩。当明日香朝她走去时，真嗣喊道，“明日香，”红发女孩回头带着疑惑的表情看着他，“她…不太爱说话，所以如果她不理你，别介意。”

"Oh, whatever." Asuka replied half-heartedly, walking closer to the First Child, who showed no sign of noticing people approaching her whatsoever. "Hello, First Child, the Pilot of Evangelion Unit 00, you know, the prototype," said Asuka as her shadow loomed over the blue-haired girl, a smirk on her face. Seeing no reaction from her, Asuka's brows furrowed a little. Still, she decided to play nice for now, recalling Shinji's warning, "I'm Asuka, the pilot of the production model. Let's be friends!"  
“哦，随便吧。”明日香半心半意地回答，走近了这位第一适格者，她完全没有注意到有人接近的迹象。“你好，第一适格者，零号机驾驶员，你知道的，那个原型机，”明日香说着，她的影子笼罩在蓝发女孩身上，脸上带着一丝得意的笑容。看到对方毫无反应，明日香的眉头微微皱起。不过，她决定暂时表现得友好一些，回想起真嗣的警告，“我是明日香，量产机的驾驶员。让我们做朋友吧！”

"Why?" Rei asked in her usual monotone voice.  
“为什么？”丽用她一贯的单调声音问道。

"Because it would be con-" "Ah Ayanami!" Shinji hastily interjected as he realized where this line of conversation would lead to, "because we are all pilots, and we should look after each other in battles! EVA is a bond, right, Asuka?" He winked at the redhead, who was irritated by his rude interruption a moment ago and glaring at him.  
“因为这会……”“啊，绫波！”真嗣急忙打断，意识到这个话题会走向何方，“因为我们都是驾驶员，战斗中应该互相照顾！EVA 是一种纽带，对吧，明日香？”他向红发女孩眨了眨眼，她刚才因他的粗鲁打断而恼火，正瞪着他。

_'EVA is a bond…'_ "I think we can be…friends, Pilot Soryu, Pilot Ikari," Rei finally replied after several seconds of musing. Shinji let out a long sigh of relief while Asuka shot him a curious look. "It looks like you know her well," she probed as they headed to the building, her voice mocking, but Shinji could undoubtedly catch a hint of sharpness.  
“EVA 是一种纽带……”“我想我们可以成为……朋友，索吕号驾驶员，碇号驾驶员，”丽沉思了几秒后终于回答。真嗣长舒了一口气，而明日香则好奇地看了他一眼。“看来你很了解她，”他们走向建筑时，她用嘲讽的语气试探道，但真嗣无疑捕捉到了一丝尖锐。

"What? I think this is my first time I've ever spoken-"  
"什么？我想这是我第一次说话——"

"But you called her Rei, while she calls you Pilot Ikari," Asuka snorted, "the way you said her name came out so naturally."  
"但你叫她丽，她却叫你碇司令，" 明日香嗤之以鼻，"你叫她名字的方式那么自然。"

_'Damn it,'_ Shinji silently cursed at his carelessness, dripping cold sweat, "but you heard her, we weren't even friends!"  
'该死，' 真嗣暗自咒骂自己的粗心，冷汗直流，"但你听到了，我们甚至不是朋友！"

"Hmph, there's something fishy you're not telling me, _Pilot Ikari._ Not that I cared enough to know." Asuka remarked and sped up her pace, leaving a confused Shinji behind.  
"哼，碇司令，你肯定有什么猫腻没告诉我。不过我也没兴趣知道。" 明日香说着加快了脚步，留下一脸困惑的真嗣。

"YES!" Came Asuka's ecstatic shriek from the living room. Inside his room, Shinji furrowed his brows, "what is it, Misato?" He stuck out his head through the crack of the door and shouted, making sure both of his roommates could hear him, "did Asuka's favorite cartoon started playing or something?"  
"太好了！" 客厅里传来明日香兴奋的尖叫声。在房间里的真嗣皱起眉头，"怎么了，美里？" 他探出头，透过门缝大声问道，确保两位室友都能听到，"是明日香最喜欢的卡通开始播放了吗？"

A flying pillow landed on the 'Shinji's-face' tarmac. "For fuck's sake, THIRD, mind your own damn business, will you? And I don't watch cartoons, only brats like you do!"  
一个飞来的枕头正中'真嗣脸'跑道。"看在老天的份上，第三适格者，管好你自己的事，行吗？我又不是看卡通的小孩，只有你这种小鬼才看！"

Shinji shook his head, "what were you so excited about, anyway?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，“你到底在兴奋什么？”

"Anta Baka? My EVA's gonna arrive tomorrow, of course."  
“笨蛋吗你？我的 EVA 明天就到了，当然兴奋。”

"Oh? What, are we supposed to pick it up?"  
“哦？什么，我们是要去接它吗？”

"Yeah, you two will be coming with me to New Yokosuka bay tomorrow." Misato interjected, "we'll pick up Unit 02 from there."  
“是啊，你们两个明天跟我去新横须贺湾。”美里插话道，“我们会在那里接走 02 号机。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. They weren't going to pick up Unit 02 from the sea? This was unexpected. How were they going to fight Gaghiel, then? They had always been using more or less the same strategy in his former lives; after all, there weren't many other ways to fight an Angel underwater. He had no idea how to fight it on land – to be honest, he wasn't even sure whether Gaghiel would appear that day. Did this mean the order of the Angels would also change?  
真嗣挑了挑眉。他们不打算从海上接走 02 号机吗？这出乎意料。那么他们将如何对抗加吉尔呢？在他之前的生命中，他们总是或多或少地使用相同的策略；毕竟，水下对抗使徒的方法并不多。他不知道如何在陆地上战斗——老实说，他甚至不确定加吉尔那天是否会出现。这是否意味着使徒的顺序也会改变？

Shinji didn't like the feeling of losing control.  
真嗣不喜欢这种失去控制的感觉。

One absolute power he held over his enemies was information. But incorrect information could only bring unforeseen consequences to him.  
他掌握的绝对权力之一是对敌人的信息优势。但错误的信息只会给他带来无法预见的后果。

The Angel was drawn by Adam in the fleet carried by Kaji; that he was sure of. He silently blessed the fact that he told his father about it. He could only hope commander Ikari listened to him and told Kaji to leave the fleet as soon as possible. If the Angel attacked while there's no pilot there…  
那个使徒是由加持在舰队中绘制的；这一点他确信无疑。他默默庆幸自己告诉了父亲这件事。他只能希望碇司令听从他的建议，并告诉加持尽快离开舰队。如果使徒在无人驾驶的情况下发动攻击……

The fact that he was still alive in this world was his only reassurance.  
他仍活在这个世界上，这是他唯一的安慰。

"Sir, the sonar of destroyer Atago picked up a large submerged object 30 nautical miles northern the fleet, sir."  
"长官，驱逐舰爱宕的声纳在舰队北面 30 海里处探测到一个大型水下物体，长官。"

"Is it moving?" "它在移动吗？"

"The extension line of its current path shows it's heading toward the New Yokosuka Bay, sir."  
"根据其当前路径的延伸线显示，它正朝向新横须贺湾方向前进，长官。"

"Speed?" “速度？”

"15 knots, sir." “15 节，长官。”

The commander of the Pacific Fleet frowned. Ryoji Kaji had left the fleet yesterday by a transport helicopter; he should be on land right now. Could the underwater object be an enemy? If it was, could it be after Unit- the _toy_ that required the entire Pacific Fleet as convey? Surely no one on earth would dare to challenge such the most powerful fleet in the world, right?  
太平洋舰队司令皱起了眉头。碇源堂昨天已经乘运输直升机离开了舰队；他现在应该在陆地上。水下物体会是敌人吗？如果是，它会是冲着 Unit——那个需要整个太平洋舰队护送的玩具而来的吗？地球上 surely no one would dare to challenge the most powerful fleet in the world, right?

"Keep an eye on it, report any anomalies."  
“留意一下，有任何异常立即报告。”

"Yes, sir." "是的，长官。"

Kaji stretched his back, lying comfortably in the bed. He had thought hotels near the seaports were all subpar in quality, but his experience proved him wrong. Maybe he got NERV's special treatment; he didn't know, he also didn't care.  
加持伸了个懒腰，舒适地躺在床上。他原以为港口附近的酒店质量都不怎么样，但这次经历证明他错了。或许是 NERV 给了他特殊待遇；他不清楚，也不在乎。

He rolled over and looked at the suitcase lying on the floor beside his bed. There was a much more critical thing that needed his constant attention.  
他翻了个身，看向床边地板上的手提箱。有件更为关键的事情需要他时刻关注。

He hoped the helicopter could bring him straight to NERV headquarters, but the fuel reserve of vehicles was the problem humanity never solved. He needed to stay here for one night, tomorrow NERV private jet would come and pick him up. There were loads of JSSDF troops surrounding the area, so he wasn't apprehensive about safety. Commander's order was to let him leave the sea as soon as possible; now that he was on land, so everything would fine, right?  
他希望直升机能直接将他送到 NERV 总部，但车辆的燃料储备问题始终是人类未解之谜。他需要在这里过一夜，明天 NERV 的私人飞机会来接他。周围布满了日本自卫队的士兵，所以他并不担心安全问题。指挥官的命令是让他尽快离开海域；既然他已经上岸，那么一切都会顺利的，对吧？

Tomorrow, he would see Misato again. A reunion he had been looking forward to for years. He smiled himself to sleep.  
明天，他就能再次见到美里了。这是他多年来一直期盼的重逢。他微笑着进入了梦乡。

The Pacific Fleet was indeed a magnificent sight, even more so when Shinji beheld it up close, contrary to what he saw on the helicopter. Several dozens of frigates, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, transport ships, and aircraft carriers stuffed the military port that's New Yokosuka, even if It's specifically designed for docking large military ships.  
太平洋舰队确实壮观，尤其是当真嗣近距离看到它时，与在直升机上所见截然不同。数十艘护卫舰、驱逐舰、巡洋舰、战列舰、运输船和航空母舰挤满了新横须贺的军港，尽管这里专为停靠大型军舰而设计。

Without the ecstatic cries from Kensuke and immature flirt attempts at Misato from Toji, the trip felt...dull. What's worse, Asuka being Asuka, was not really talking to him; even stranger, she kept stealing glances at him when she thought he wasn't looking. Shinji sighed internally; why this girl had to be so stubborn? If she just asked-  
没有了真希和幼稚的向美里调情以及剑介的狂喜呼喊，这次旅行显得……乏味。更糟糕的是，明日香还是那个明日香，根本不怎么和他说话；更奇怪的是，她总在他不经意间偷瞄他。真嗣内心叹息；为什么这女孩非要这么固执？如果她只是开口问——

_Shinji, why don't you do anything?! Hold me, kiss me, kill me! Do something!  
真嗣，你怎么什么都不做？！抱我，吻我，杀我！做点什么！_

His train of dark thoughts screeched to a halt as Asuka's voice came to him, "so, Baka-Shinji, are you ready to behold the beauty that's Unit 02, the most advanced Evangelion in the world?"  
他阴郁的思绪戛然而止，因为明日香的声音传入耳中，“那么，笨蛋真嗣，准备好一睹二号机，世界上最先进的 EVA 的风采了吗？”

"Hm? Oh, how is it different than Unit 01, anyway?" Shinji remarked offhandedly, already knowing what's coming next.  
"嗯？哦，反正和 01 号机有什么不同呢？" 真嗣随口说道，已经预料到接下来会发生什么。

"Well, Unit 00 and Unit 01 are just necessary steps in the Evangelion development process, being the prototype and test-type respectively, the fact that it could synchronize so well with an untrained pilot like you is a proof of that," Asuka boasted with a supercilious smirk on her face, "but Unit 02 is different! It's the production model, specifically designed for combat, the world's first true Evangelion!"  
"嗯，00 号机和 01 号机只是使徒开发过程中的必要步骤，分别是原型机和测试机型，它能与你这样未经训练的驾驶员如此完美同步，就是这一点的证明，" 明日香带着得意的微笑夸耀道，"但 02 号机不同！它是量产机型，专门为战斗设计，是世界上第一台真正的使徒！"

Shinji couldn't help but chuckle at the identical phrases he had heard countless times.  
真嗣忍不住笑了起来，这些相同的词句他已经听过无数次了。

Asuka narrowed her eyes, glaring at him with a murderous look, "Any last words?!"  
明日香眯起眼睛，用一种杀气腾腾的眼神瞪着他，“有什么遗言吗？！”

"You said that like you were trying to sell it," Shinji remarked, "I'd say you definitely hooked up my attention." He improvised, not wanting to escalate the situation.  
“你那样子说，好像在推销什么似的，”真嗣评论道，“我得说，你确实引起了我的注意。”他即兴发挥，不想让情况升级。

He let out a relieved sigh internally as Asuka's glare weakened, "You're lucky I'm in too good a mood to kill you today, Baka!" She looked around, "I wonder where he is?" She murmured to herself, not unheard by Shinji.  
他内心松了一口气，因为明日香的瞪视减弱了，“算你今天走运，我心情太好不想杀你，笨蛋！”她环顾四周，“不知道他在哪儿？”她喃喃自语，声音并未逃过真嗣的耳朵。

"Who? Is there someone you're waiting for?"  
"谁？你在等什么人吗？"

"Kaji, you don't know him. He's my...b-boyfriend." Asuka intentionally chose that specific word, expecting a reaction from the mysterious Third Child.  
"加持，你不认识他。他是我的...男...男朋友。" 明日香故意选择了那个特定的词，期待着这位神秘的第三适格者会有所反应。

To her utter shock, Shinji looked like he barely held back a laugh, which turned out to be a chuckle. "What's so funny?" She hissed.  
令她极度震惊的是，真嗣看起来几乎要忍不住笑出声，结果却只是轻声笑了一下。"有什么好笑的？" 她低声质问道。

"Nothing, just feeling bad for the boy." Shinji braced himself for the slap, perhaps even a kick in the crotch as he commented.  
“没什么，只是为那孩子感到难过。” 真嗣为自己可能挨的一巴掌，甚至是一脚，做好了准备，当他评论道。

To his surprise, the physical violence from the redhead never came. Instead, she just glared daggers at him, "he's not a boy, he's a real man! Unlike you, you're just a spoiled little brat!"  
令他惊讶的是，红发女孩并没有动手打他。相反，她只是狠狠地瞪着他，“他不是男孩，他是真正的男人！不像你，你只是个被宠坏的小鬼！”

"Actually, I've heard Misato talk about him," his statement was technically true as long as he didn't specify the timeframe.  
“实际上，我听美里谈起过他，”他的陈述在技术上是真实的，只要他不指明时间范围。

Asuka frowned, "what? What did she talk about?" Her voice carried a hint of worry.  
明日香皱起眉头，“什么？她说了什么？”她的声音中带着一丝担忧。

"I don't think I can tell you, it's...personal."  
“我觉得我不能告诉你，这是……私人的事。”

Asuka huffed, mentally noting to herself that she needed to observe the Captain's behavior around Kaji later, "Speaking of which...why she still hasn't come back yet? Does putting down your name on a piece of paper take so long?"  
明日香哼了一声，心里暗自记下要留意队长和加持先生后来的互动，“说到这个……她怎么还没回来？在纸上写下名字需要这么久吗？”

"Hello kiddos," A husky male voice came to the pilots, immediately recognized by the redhead, who snapped her head in the direction of the voice, a faint blush crept up her cheeks, "KAJI!" She squealed like a schoolgirl, waving her hand to greet the special inspector.  
"孩子们，你们好，"一个沙哑的男声传到驾驶员们耳中，红发女孩立刻认出了这个声音，猛地转头望向声音的方向，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，"加持先生！"她尖叫着，像个小女生一样挥手打招呼。

Kaji Ryoji walked to the kids, and Asuka instantly wrapped herself around his left arm. "So you must be the Third Child, Shinji Ikari, huh? I'm Kaji Ryoji, nice to meet ya." He greeted, trying to brush the redhead off.  
加持良治走向孩子们，明日香立刻抱住了他的左臂。"这么说你就是第三适格者，碇真嗣了？我是加持良治，很高兴见到你。"他打招呼道，试图摆脱红发女孩的纠缠。

"Right, and you're just as handsome as Misato said, Kaji-san," Shinji replied with a smile, contrary to his racing heart. Why was Kaji here? Did he have Adam with him?  
"没错，正如美里小姐所说，加持先生你真的很帅，"真嗣微笑着回答，尽管他的心跳得厉害。加持为什么会在这里？他是不是带着亚当？

Kaji blinked, then laughed. "You aren't the only one who knows how wild in bed she is, Shinji-kun."  
加持眨了眨眼，随即笑道：“你不是唯一一个知道她在床上有多狂野的人，真嗣君。”

Asuka just stood there, red-faced, her fists clenching tightly. She couldn't believe what her brain told her she just heard. There's no doubt Kaji and Misato had a past relationship, and from the sounds of it, they still thought about each other, which meant her chance was minimal.  
明日香只是站在那里，满脸通红，拳头紧握。她无法相信自己的大脑告诉她刚刚听到的话。毫无疑问，加持和美里有过一段关系，而且从他们的语气来看，他们仍然想着对方，这意味着她的机会微乎其微。

Thankfully a distraction she desperately needed was provided. "Look, my Unit 02!" She exclaimed as the transport ship Othello started unloading its cargo, the giant cranes lifting a crimson humanoid to the ground.  
幸运的是，她迫切需要的分心之事出现了。“看，我的二号机！”她喊道，随着奥赛罗运输船开始卸货，巨大的起重机将一具深红色的类人形机体吊到地面。

"Hm, it's red, definitely fits your fiery personality," Shinji commented, "I'm actually jealous."  
"嗯，是红色的，确实很符合你那火热的性格，" 真嗣评论道，"我其实挺羡慕的。"

"You should be! A better pilot like me gets better treatment," Asuka smirked proudly, "of course the color scheme of your EVA is nowhere near mine."  
"你当然应该羡慕！像我这样更优秀的驾驶员自然得到更好的待遇，" 明日香得意地笑了笑，"你的 EVA 配色自然比不上我的。"

As for Misato Katsuragi, things weren't going so smooth. The proud captain of _Over the Rainbow_ didn't miss a single chance to belittle the _toy_ they escorted. After a while of tensioned exchange, the captain finally reluctantly signed his name on the document, signifying now Unit 02 was completely under NERV jurisdiction.  
至于葛城美里，情况就没那么顺利了。作为 Over the Rainbow 的骄傲队长，他可不会放过任何一个贬低他们护送的玩具的机会。在一番紧张的交流后，队长最终不情愿地在文件上签下了自己的名字，这意味着二号机现在完全归 NERV 管辖。

Misato adjusted her red jacket and left the aircraft carrier. The gangway was much more unstable than when she was boarding the ship. Maybe it's the wind? She didn't care. She needed to go back to her charges soon.  
美里调整了一下她的红色夹克，离开了航空母舰。舷梯比她登船时更加不稳。也许是风的原因？她并不在意。她需要尽快回到她的责任中。

"Hey kid-WHAT ARE **YOU** DOING HERE?" Misato cried as the unshaven man came into her view.  
“嘿，小子——你在这里干什么？”美里喊道，当那个胡子拉碴的男人进入她的视线时。

"Hey Katsuragi, I'm here on a special mission assigned by NERV, and I'm also the special inspector," Kaji replied with his lady-killing smile, to which Misato simply snorted.  
“嘿，葛城，我是根据 NERV 的特别任务来到这里的，同时也是特别检查官，”加持用他那迷倒众生的微笑回答道，美里对此只是哼了一声。

"So you're staying with us for a while?" Asuka asked with surprise in her voice. For one, she dreaded that Misato would steal Kaji away from her if they spent too much time together. For another, she also wanted him in her vicinity herself.  
"所以你要和我们住一段时间？" 明日香惊讶地问道。一方面，她担心美里会从她身边抢走加持，如果他们相处太久的话。另一方面，她也希望他能在自己附近。

"Yes Asuka, I'm working in NERV headquarters now," Kaji turned to look at Misato, "we can hang out together, just like the old times Katsuragi."  
"是的，明日香，我现在在 NERV 总部工作，" 加持转向美里，"我们可以像以前一样一起出去玩，Katsuragi。"

Shinji watched the whole exchange with amusement, much more so when he saw the face Asuka was making. Clearly, Kaji was ignoring her for Misato, which only confirmed her fears.  
真嗣饶有兴致地观察着整个交流过程，尤其是看到明日香脸上的表情时更是如此。显然，加持在忽视明日香而选择美里，这只会加深她的担忧。

"Who'd want a jerk like y-" She was interrupted by the simultaneous ringing of Asuka, Shinji, and her phones. This could only mean one thing.  
"谁会想要一个像你这样的混蛋——" 她的话被同时响起的明日香、真嗣和她的手机铃声打断。这只能意味着一件事。

"An Angel Attack? Now?" Her voice carried a tinge of panic. She picked up the phone and put it on speakers, Ritsuko's nervous voice came to her and the pilots, "Captain Katsuragi, we've detected a pattern blue 5 nautical miles away from the shore, heading to New Yokosuka bay!"  
"使徒来袭？现在？" 她的声音带着一丝慌乱。她拿起手机并调至扬声器模式，传来的是赤木律子紧张的声音，"葛城上尉，我们在距离海岸五海里的地方探测到了蓝色模式，正朝新横须贺湾方向移动！"

Kaji raised an eyebrow. This was unexpected. Damn it, he had Adam here! If the Angel came into contact with it…the world would probably end. He needed to escape. "Katsuragi, I've got things to deliver. See you in headquarters!" Without hesitation, he turned to leave the site, hopping up a humvee. Although NERV private jet hadn't arrived yet, under emergency situations like an Angel Attack, important NERV personnel could always _borrow_ JSSDF vehicles.  
加持皱了皱眉。这出乎意料。该死，他这里还有亚当！如果使徒与之接触……世界可能就此终结。他需要逃离。"葛城，我有东西要送。总部见！" 毫不犹豫地，他转身离开现场，跳上一辆悍马。尽管 NERV 的私人飞机尚未抵达，但在使徒袭击这样的紧急情况下，NERV 的重要人员总能借用自卫队的车辆。

"He…just…left," Misato said, mouth agape, unable to believe what just happened. Shinji, on the other hand, knew perfectly well why Kaji ran away. It's definitely not a good idea to have Adam in the same area where you fought Angels.  
"他……就……这么走了，" 美里目瞪口呆，无法相信刚刚发生的事。另一方面，真嗣非常清楚加持为什么会逃跑。在曾经与使徒战斗过的地方存放亚当，绝对不是个好主意。

"Third Child, come with me!" Asuka grabbed Shinji's wrist and dragged him toward Unit 02. He didn't protest; the touch of her slender hand wrapped around his wrist was always a nice feeling.  
"第三适格者，跟我来！" 明日香抓住真嗣的手腕，拉着他向二号机走去。他没有反抗；她纤细的手环绕在他手腕上的触感总是那么美好。

The problem was neither of the Children had plugsuits with them. On one hand, he didn't think Gaghiel would attack so quickly. On the other hand, he really had no reasons to bring it; it would raise suspicions. The only function of a plugsuit was to help you pilot an EVA; since no one expected an Angel Attack, there's no feasible pretense for him to bring one.  
问题在于，两个孩子都没有带插入栓服。一方面，他没想到加吉尔会这么快发动攻击。另一方面，他确实没有理由带上它；那会引起怀疑。插入栓服的唯一功能是帮助你驾驶 EVA；既然没人预料到使徒的袭击，他就没有合理的借口带上一件。

Fortunately, he brought his A-10 neural connectors, and Asuka always had hers on her head.  
幸运的是，他带上了他的 A-10 神经连接器，而明日香总是把她的戴在头上。

The Second Child rolled her eyes, hitting the switch to open up the Entry Plug. As she entered the EVA, Shinji followed closely behind.  
第二适格者翻了个白眼，按下开关打开插入栓。她进入 EVA 时，真嗣紧随其后。

"Get ready for an amazing display of piloting." She boasted. "Just don't bug me, okay?"  
“准备好见识一下精彩的驾驶表演吧。”她夸口道，“别烦我，好吗？”

The Entry Plug sealed shut, and a series of lights began to flicker around the two while Asuka commenced with the startup process. "LCL Füllung. Anfang der Bewegung. Bestätigt. Anfang des Nervenanschlusses. Bestätigt. Auslöses von Links-kleidung. Synchro-start!" The lights around the two began to flicker, and this time Shinji could think in German. The LCL drenched Asuka's dress, making it almost transparent. Shinji could see her white bra and panties through the wet clothing.  
插入栓密封关闭，一系列灯光开始在两人周围闪烁，而明日香开始了启动程序。“LCL 填充。开始移动。确认。神经连接开始。确认。触发左衣装。同步启动！”灯光在两人周围闪烁，这次真嗣能用德语思考了。LCL 浸湿了明日香的裙子，使其几乎透明。真嗣透过湿透的衣服能看到她的白色胸罩和内裤。

Asuka lowered her head saw her current state, her face instantly blushed a luminescent blush, "forget about witnessing my superior skills, get out NOW you PERVERT!"  
明日香低下头看到自己的现状，脸上立刻泛起亮丽的红晕，“别想看我高超的技巧了，现在就滚出去，你这个变态！”

"We only have one minute of power left, in case you haven't noticed, Asuka," Shinji shot back, "I promise I won't look…much, alright?!" 'It's _not like I haven't seen them before,'_ his mind added, his cheeks started heating up.  
"我们只剩下最后一分钟电量了，你没注意到吗，明日香？" 真嗣回敬道，"我保证不会看太多……行了吧？！" '又不是没见过，' 他心里补充道，脸颊开始发热。

"Argh," Asuka growled, spreading her legs, "come here, sit between my laps," she patted the vacant space of her pilot seat, "this way you can't look. Don't get funny ideas! I'll kill you if you dare to look back!" The fact that Shinji seemed disinterested in her body soothed her discomfort just by a bit. If she had any other options, she wouldn't do this.  
"啊，" 明日香咆哮着，张开双腿，"过来，坐在我腿间，" 她拍了拍驾驶座上的空位，"这样你就看不到我了。别胡思乱想！敢回头我就宰了你！" 真嗣对她身体似乎不感兴趣这一点，稍稍缓解了她的不适。如果有其他选择，她绝不会这么做。

After Shinji moved into position, Asuka shouted, "Evangelion Unit 02, go!"  
真嗣就位后，明日香大喊："二号机，出击！"

XXXXXX

Unit 02 stood on the flight deck of _Over the Rainbow,_ having attached to the umbilical cable; thankfully, they didn't need to jump from ship to ship this time. Although Asuka never disappointed him in playing battleship hopscotch, he couldn't help but worry every time they did it. It was a life-or-death situation, after all.  
02 号机站在彩虹之上的飞行甲板上，已经连接上了脐带电缆；谢天谢地，这次他们不需要从一艘船跳到另一艘船了。尽管明日香在玩跳船游戏时从未让他失望，但他每次都忍不住担心。毕竟，这是生死攸关的情况。

"I've got visuals on the target," Asuka declared as she saw the Angel began to surface, exposing its upper half to them. It looked something along the lines of a twisted fusion of a whale and a manta-ray, only bigger. Once it was within close proximity of the ship, it shot out of the water and leaped to them. Just as Shinji thought it would slam on the flight deck, the air around the Angel simmered as it activated its AT-Field, lifting its immense body up as the Angel continued flying forward.  
“我已经看到目标了，”明日香宣布道，她看到使徒开始浮出水面，向他们暴露出上半身。它看起来像是鲸鱼和蝠鲼的扭曲融合体，只是更大。当它靠近船只时，它从水中射出并向他们跃来。正当真嗣以为它会撞上飞行甲板时，使徒周围的空气开始沸腾，它激活了 AT 力场，将其庞大的身躯抬起，使徒继续向前飞行。

_'Of course Angels could do that,'_ Shinji quickly regained his composure from his state of shock, "wait, where is it going?" His eyes traced Angel's path; at the end of the extension line he saw a large helipad, where a greenish transport chopper had just taken off.  
“当然天使可以做到那样，”真嗣迅速从震惊状态中恢复镇定，“等等，它要去哪儿？”他的目光追随着天使的轨迹；在延伸线的尽头，他看到了一个巨大的停机坪，那里一架绿褐色的运输直升机刚刚起飞。

His eyes widened in fear as realization struck him. Of course the Angel was looking for Adam. Why should it care about fighting the EVAs?  
他的眼睛因恐惧而睁大，当意识到真相时。当然，天使是在寻找亚当。它为何要在意与 EVA 的战斗呢？

The Angel kept floating toward the helipad; its larger-than-the-aircraft-carrier body loomed over EVA Unit 02 and New Yokosuka Bay beneath it. Asuka willed her EVA running after the big fish, trying to come up with a way to kill it. The helicopter pilot watched in dread as a gigantic fish-like creature flew toward him, hiding his face behind his raised arm in a futile attempt to block the inevitable.  
天使继续向停机坪飘去；它那比航空母舰还要庞大的身躯笼罩在 EVA 二号机和新横须贺湾之上。明日香操控着她的 EVA 追赶着这条大鱼，试图想出一个杀死它的方法。直升机驾驶员惊恐地看着一个巨大的鱼形生物向他飞来，绝望地举起手臂试图遮挡即将到来的命运。

Shinji's mind was on overdrive. He never thought Gaghiel could fight anywhere other than underwater. As the Angel came closer to its target, he closed his eyes. What's the worst could happen? Another reset?  
真嗣的思绪飞速运转。他从没想到加吉尔能在水下以外的地方战斗。当使徒逐渐逼近目标时，他闭上了眼睛。最坏的情况会是什么？再来一次重置吗？

_'But she will die again, and this time because of you,'_ his mind argued. Shinji clenched his fist, his knuckles became white. He would never let her die because of his own inaction ever again. He already promised to himself after the first cycle.  
“但她会再次死去，而这次是因为你，”他的内心争辩道。真嗣紧握拳头，指节变得苍白。他绝不会再因为自己的不作为而让她死去。在第一次循环后，他就已经对自己许下了承诺。

Suddenly an idea struck him, "Asuka, expand your AT-Field!" Shinji shouted, "we need to neutralize the Angel's AT-Field!"  
突然，一个念头闪过他的脑海，“明日香，扩展你的 AT 力场！”真嗣大喊，“我们需要中和使徒的 AT 力场！”

Asuka was also confused by the Angel's behavior. She complied with his request reflexively since she didn't really have a plan. Unit 02's AT-Field expanded, the ground shook as it collided with Gaghiel's. The Angel of fish fell to the ground as its already-under-heavy-stress AT-Field collapsed, its long mouth slammed on the tarmac from where Kaji's helicopter just took off.  
明日香也对使徒的行为感到困惑。她下意识地遵从了他的请求，因为她并没有真正的计划。二号机的 AT 力场扩展，地面在它与 Gaghiel 的碰撞中震动。鱼形使徒倒在地上，其本已承受重压的 AT 力场崩溃，长嘴猛地砸在柏油路上，正是 Kaji 的直升机刚刚起飞的地方。

"Phew that was fucking close," the pilot cursed, pulling up the plane. Kaji let out a sigh he didn't know he was holding as they went farther and farther from the Angel.  
“呼，真他妈的险。”飞行员咒骂着拉起飞机。Kaji 长出了一口气，他甚至没意识到自己一直屏着呼吸，随着他们离使徒越来越远。

The Angel of fish lay on the ground, unable to move an inch. "That was not half bad an idea, coming from a rookie like you, Baka-Shinji," Asuka smirked triumphantly as she willed her EVA coming close to the immobilized Angel, pulling out her progressive knife. Gaghiel simply lay there like a fat fish on a chopping block, placing itself at the redhead's mercy.  
鱼形使徒躺在地上，动弹不得。“这主意还不赖，对你这样的新手来说，笨蛋真嗣，”明日香得意地笑着，操控她的 EVA 靠近无法动弹的使徒，拔出高振动粒子刀。Gaghiel 就像砧板上的大鱼一样躺在那里，任由红发少女摆布。

Kaji stood in Gendo's office, the black case that held Adam on his desk. "Well, my goodness, that was a rather eventful trip, wasn't it? Your son and Pilot Soryu really saved the world there. Was it caused by this I wonder?" He opened the case on the desk, revealing Adam. "It's restored itself this far, even though it's frozen and suspended, it's still alive. It's actually quite amazing really. So, I'm guessing this is the key to the Human Instrumentality Project?"  
加持站在碇源堂的办公室里，那个装着亚当的黑箱子放在他的桌上。“哎呀，那次旅行真是惊心动魄，不是吗？你的儿子和驾驶员惣流真是拯救了世界。我想，这难道是由此引起的吗？”他打开桌上的箱子，露出亚当。“尽管被冻结并处于休眠状态，它已经恢复到这种程度，依然活着。这真的很了不起。那么，我猜这就是人类补完计划的关键？”

"Correct." Gendo agreed, pushing up his glasses. _'And I have my son's help…although his ultimate purpose isn't to help me.'_ "This is the first human… this is Adam." _'Thankfully, I listened to him…if the Angel attacks on the sea…'_  
"“正确。”碇源堂同意道，推了推眼镜。‘而且我有我儿子的帮助……尽管他最终的目的并非助我一臂之力。’“这是第一个人类……这是亚当。”‘幸好我听了他的……如果使徒在海上发起攻击……’”

Kaji bowed a little and left the office, leaving Gendo Ikari - the most dangerous silent schemer on earth - alone with his turmoil of thoughts.  
加持微微鞠躬，离开了办公室，留下碇源堂——地球上最危险的沉默策划者——独自陷入思绪的纷扰之中。

**Chapter 6: Checks and Balances  
第六章：制衡之道**

The EVA cages were usually quiet when there were no Angel Attacks nor harmonic tests, added that few people dared to raise their volume there, dreading the chastise that's named Commander Ikari.  
在没有使徒袭击或谐波测试的情况下，EVA 笼通常是安静的，再加上很少有人敢在那里提高音量，唯恐招致碇司令的训斥。

Today became a divergence from the routine as the silence was broken by the excited shriek coming from a certain redhead.  
今天，这种常规被打破了，因为某个红发女孩的兴奋尖叫声打破了寂静。

"YES!" Asuka exclaimed as the gigantic laser printer finished drawing the last stroke of the killmark. A lifelike 1:300 Gaghiel paint now sat on the upper right torso of Unit 02, much to Asuka's satisfaction. A killmark. Of an Angel. On her Unit 02, not on Unit 01 – her rival EVA Unit, piloted by the invincible Shinji-sama, not to mention it already had two killmarks painted on it. She literally got aroused whenever she set her eyes on the masterpiece.  
“太棒了！”明日香欢呼道，巨大的激光打印机完成了击杀标记的最后一笔。一个栩栩如生的 1:300 加吉尔涂装现在位于 02 号机右上躯干，这让明日香非常满意。一个击杀标记。一个使徒的标记。在她的 02 号机上，而不是在 01 号机——她的竞争对手 EVA 上，由无敌的碇真嗣驾驶，更不用说它已经画有两个击杀标记了。每当她看到这件杰作时，她都会感到兴奋不已。

"Asuka, I made my own contribution as well, don't forget," Shinji reminded, smirking.  
“明日香，我也做出了自己的贡献，别忘了，”真嗣提醒道，嘴角带着一丝微笑。

In fact, NERV was planning on splitting the credit, but since it was 'EVA Unit 02' which killed it, and the killmark went on the EVA, not – say, plugsuits of the pilots who killed it – their final decision was to have it printed on Unit 02 only.  
事实上，NERV 原本计划平分功劳，但由于是‘EVA 02 号机’击杀了它，而且击杀标记是画在 EVA 上，而不是——比如说，画在击杀了它的驾驶员的插入栓服上——他们最终决定只在 02 号机上打印这个标记。

"What, you were just there to disturb me with your perverted thoughts! Who knew what went on in your dirty brain that time!" Asuka retorted, her cheeks heating up at the embarrassing memory. After she dealt the fatal blow to the Angel's core, the explosion sent her EVA flying away and landed hard on a nearby hill. The collision threw Shinji off the seat since he didn't have a harness, and his face ended up sitting conveniently between her breasts.  
"什么，你当时只是在那里用你的变态想法打扰我！谁知道你那肮脏的脑子里当时在想些什么！" 明日香反驳道，想到那尴尬的记忆，她的脸颊开始发热。在她对使徒的核心造成致命一击后，爆炸将她的 EVA 炸飞，重重地摔在附近的小山上。撞击使得真嗣因为没有安全带而从座位上摔了下来，结果他的脸正好落在了她的胸部之间。

Shinji sighed mentally at the memory. A minor concussion and bruising weren't really worth it.  
真嗣在心里叹了口气，回忆起那段经历。轻微的脑震荡和擦伤真的不值得。

"If you weren't there to distract me, I would've killed it much faster!" Asuka continued to boast; Shinji interjected, "to your credit, Asuka, you performed well in combat, you didn't disappoint me with your piloting skills, but," he paused for a second, adjusting his composure under her glare that dared him to say the rest, "I was the one who came up with the plan. You really think you could've beaten the Angel all by yourself, Asuka? We work as a team. If we were late by one second…Kaji-san, your boyfriend, as you said, could've been killed."  
"如果你不在那里分散我的注意力，我本可以更快地干掉它！" 明日香继续自夸；真嗣插话道，"值得称赞的是，明日香，你在战斗中表现出色，你的驾驶技术没有让我失望，但是，" 他在她的瞪视下停顿了一下，那眼神似乎在挑战他继续说下去，"是我提出了那个计划。你真的认为你能独自打败使徒吗，明日香？我们是作为一个团队工作的。如果我们晚了一秒……正如你所说的，你的男朋友加持先生可能就已经死了。"

Asuka's fist clenched tightly as she decided between 'kill him now' and 'give him credit.' Seconds later she let out a long sigh, "you're lucky I don't feel like killing people today, Third Child," her voice not as cold as she intended it to be. She knew perfectly well that Kaji indeed was mere inches from seeing the God, and she would never forgive herself if that happened.  
明日香紧握拳头，在“现在就杀了他”和“给他点面子”之间抉择。几秒钟后，她长叹一声，“算你今天走运，我不太想杀人，第三适格者，”她的声音并没有如她所愿那般冰冷。她非常清楚，加持确实只差几英寸就能见到神，如果真的发生了，她永远无法原谅自己。

"So? Team?" Shinji probed.  
“那么？团队怎么样？”真嗣试探性地问道。

"Don't push your luck," Asuka hissed, turning to leave.  
“别得寸进尺，”明日香低声呵斥，转身离开。

Shinji sighed. Fortunately, he had his own ways to cheer up the moody Second Child.  
真嗣叹了口气。幸运的是，他有自己的办法来哄这位情绪多变的二号适格者开心。

Asuka was assaulted by the _heavenly_ aroma of one of her favorite German dishes as she stepped into the apartment. She frowned in confusion before sniffing the air several more times, which confirmed her suspicion.  
明日香一踏进公寓，就被一股她最爱的德国菜的诱人香气所包围。她困惑地皱起眉头，又多次嗅了嗅空气，这证实了她的猜想。

Someone was making _Käsespätzle_. Only her mother had made it for her.  
有人在做奶酪蛋面。只有她母亲曾为她做过这道菜。

Her puzzlement only grew with every step she took as she marched to the living room. Who could be cooking? Definitely not Misato, not that she would eat it if it really was her. Could it be takeout? She squashed that thought since all of the nearby restaurants didn't so much as make European food, let alone German ones.  
她每走一步，困惑便加深一分，当她走向客厅时。谁会在做饭呢？肯定不是美里，就算真是她做的，她也不会吃。会是外卖吗？她否定了这个想法，因为附近的所有餐馆连欧洲菜都不怎么做，更别提德国菜了。

Could it be Shinji? 会是真嗣吗？

As absurd as it sounded, that's the most probable one among all.  
尽管听起来荒谬，但这在所有可能性中是最有可能的一个。

But why would he do that? He was her competition, not so much as…a friend. She would call him a working partner at most. She bet he regarded her the same. Even though he almost cooked every meal for the whole house, he never tried making German cuisine before.  
但他为何要这么做？他是她的竞争对手，谈不上是……朋友。她最多称他为工作伙伴。她敢打赌，他也是这么看她的。尽管他几乎为整个屋子的人做饭，却从未尝试过做德国菜。

Still, her eyes couldn't lie. Shinji, in a pink-blue apron, was standing in front of the stove. Beside him, a plate full of _Käsespätzle_ was sitting on the kitchen cupboard.  
然而，她的眼睛不会说谎。真嗣穿着粉蓝色围裙，站在炉子前。他旁边，一盘满满的奶酪蛋面放在厨柜上。

"Smells…mediocre, but considering it's your first try I'll give it a pass," Asuka remarked.  
“闻起来……一般般，但考虑到这是你第一次尝试，我就勉强通过吧，”明日香评论道。

"Oh my my, Shinji's secret plan to defuse the bomb actually worked," said Misato as she gulped down a can of beer, "I mean, what else could girls want? Keep it up, and she'll be falling into your arms in no time."  
“哎呀呀，真嗣的秘密计划居然成功拆弹了，”美里一边喝着啤酒一边说道，“我是说，女孩们还能要求什么呢？继续保持，她很快就会投入你的怀抱了。”

Asuka wanted to retort since she found the idea ridiculous; he made it clear that he thought being her…boyfriend would be pitiful, right? On second thought, she regarded this as a perfect opportunity to pay him back. "Oh, I know no boy could reject my beauty. Sadly he'll never succeed, I've already met a real man, while he's just a little boy."  
明日香本想反驳，因为她觉得这个想法很荒谬；他明明已经表明了，他认为做她的……男朋友会很可怜，对吧？但转念一想，她认为这是个绝佳的报复机会。“哦，我知道没有男孩能拒绝我的美貌。可惜他永远不会成功，我已经遇到了一个真正的男人，而他只是个小男孩。”

"Says the little girl who lost in the sync test again." Shinji shot back.  
“说这话的小女孩又在同步测试中输了。”真嗣回击道。

"I will destroy you in the next sync test! Just you wait!" Asuka crushed the empty cola can in her hand.  
"下次同步测试中我会彻底打败你！等着瞧吧！" 明日香捏扁了手中的空可乐罐。

Shinji smiled internally. After all the time he spent with the fiery redhead, he had already mastered how to use her pride to motivate her to try harder while not hurting her too much. From the almost 7 percent increase in her sync rate in today's test, he knew his plan was working just as expected.  
真嗣内心微微一笑。毕竟与这位火爆的红发少女相处了这么久，他早已掌握了如何利用她的骄傲来激励她更加努力，同时又不至于伤害到她。从今天测试中她同步率近 7%的提升来看，他知道自己的计划正如预期般奏效。

Shinji came to the dining table and put down three plates of _Käsespätzle_ before turning to the bathroom.  
真嗣走到餐桌前，放下三盘奶酪面疙瘩，然后转向浴室。

"Asuka, are you alright?" Misato asked in a sincere voice, "you look…down."  
"明日香，你还好吗？" 美里用真诚的语气问道，"你看起来……情绪低落。"

"Can't imagine why is, can you?" Asuka muttered, "obviously it's because of that baka."  
"想不出为什么，你能吗？" 明日香嘀咕道，"显然是因为那个笨蛋。"

"Oh?" Misato winked, "having a crush on him?"  
"哦？" 美里眨了眨眼，"对他有意思吗？"

To her surprise, Asuka didn't even try to act defensively, "it's not that…he just," she paused for a moment, "he gets under my skin so easily. Every insult I throw at him, he has a way to throw it back at me, or dodge it completely. What's worse, he won't even leave me alone."  
令她惊讶的是，明日香甚至没有试图采取防御姿态，“不是那样的……他只是，”她顿了一下，“他轻易就能激怒我。我对他说的每一句侮辱，他都有办法回敬给我，或是完全避开。更糟糕的是，他甚至不让我一个人待着。”

"Sounds like he took a liking to you."  
“听起来他对你有好感。”

"Don't make me laugh," Asuka snorted.  
“别逗我笑了，”明日香嗤之以鼻。

"You don't know what's inside a man's heart," Misato said and walked over to her purse, pulling something out of it, "well, you'll need this to get in tomorrow." Misato handed her a new ID card. "Your new ID card, it finally came today."  
"你不知道一个人心里藏着什么，" 美里说道，走向她的手提包，从中取出某物，"嗯，明天你需要这个才能进来。" 美里递给她一张新的身份证。"你的新身份证，今天终于到了。"

Asuka took the card and saw her picture on the front. "Oh look, a shitty picture of me! What the HELL is this lighting?! I look like a fucking ghost!"  
明日香接过卡片，看到正面有自己的照片。"哦，看，我这张糟糕的照片！这他妈是什么光线？！我看起来像个鬼一样！"

"You still look cute, just relax." Misato sighed, "So, always have that with you, Asuka, otherwise you can't get into Geofront." She smirked, "also, could you do me a favor, Asuka?" She asked with a promising look, one which indicated nothing good would come next.  
"你看起来还是很可爱，放松点。" 美里叹了口气，"所以，要一直带着它，明日香，否则你进不了地底都市。" 她微微一笑，"另外，你能帮我个忙吗，明日香？" 她带着一种预示不祥的神情问道。

"Why would I?" "我为什么要这么做？"

"Can you take this other card to Rei?" Misato handed over a mostly identical card for Rei, ignoring her impoliteness, "Hers is expired, and I forgot to give it to her when we saw her. Can you drop it off to her tomorrow? She lives in the southern section of town, from when this place was still called Hakone, and not Tokyo– 3. Don't worry, I'll have Section-2 watch over closely."  
"你能把这个给丽送去吗？" 美里递给明日香一张与丽几乎相同的卡片，无视她的无礼，"她的过期了，我们上次见她时我忘了给她。你明天能送过去吗？她住在镇南边，那时候这里还叫箱根，不是东京-3。别担心，我会让第二课密切监视的。"

"Me?" Asuka asked as she stared at the picture of Rei on the card. "There's no way-"  
"我？" 明日香看着卡片上丽的照片问道，"不可能——"

"Ah Misato, I can do it," Shinji said as he came out of the bathroom.  
"啊，美里，我能做到的。" 真嗣从浴室出来时说道。

"Awww," Misato grinned smugly, "Shinji's going to her home. Alone. Asuka you need to work fast, or Rei's gonna steal him!"  
"哎呀呀，" 美里得意地笑着，"真嗣要去她家了。一个人。明日香，你得抓紧了，不然丽就要把他抢走了！"

"As if I care!" Asuka barked.  
"谁在乎啊！" 明日香厉声说道。

"Misato…" Shinji sighed as he took Rei's ID card, "just let the kid be."  
"美里…" 真嗣叹了口气，接过绫波的身份证，"就让那孩子去吧。"

Asuka shot him a death glare before digging in the food. After all, the German dish was too good to waste.  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后继续享用美食。毕竟，这道德国菜太美味了，不能浪费。

_'I really should talk with my father about it…'_ Shinji sighed internally as he approached the familiar demolition zone. He was in the old section of town, and everything looked run down. The concrete facades were cracked and weathered, several buildings in the area were half deconstructed, the road heavily worn and cracked with weeds coming up between the cracks. The plants along the row of buildings were heavily overgrown; the lines painted on the road were faded.  
'我真的应该和父亲谈谈这件事…' 真嗣内心叹息着，走向那片熟悉的拆迁区。他身处旧城区，一切看起来都破败不堪。混凝土外墙裂痕累累，饱经风霜，几栋建筑半毁，道路严重磨损且裂缝纵横，裂缝间长满了野草。沿街的植物茂密得过分；路面上画的线条也已褪色。

The entire area looked abandoned.  
整个区域看起来荒废已久。

Shinji stood in front of apartment 402 and swallowed. The door of the condo was scuffed, and the paint was starting to peel. He didn't even bother knocking; he had learned that he would never get an answer. He carefully pushed the door open and walked inside, slipping off his shoes in the entryway.  
真嗣站在 402 号公寓前，咽了咽口水。公寓的门上有刮痕，油漆也开始剥落。他甚至懒得敲门；他知道永远不会有人应答。他小心翼翼地推开门，走了进去，在入口处脱下鞋子。

The room was filthy with garbage strewn around like it didn't matter. The light in her room was broken, her bed and pillow had dried bloodstains, and was covered in what looked like clean clothes. There was a mini-fridge in her room, with a half dozen medication on top of it. In the corner, a cardboard box filled with bloody bandages sat in the shadows.  
房间里满是垃圾，散落一地，仿佛无所谓。她房间的灯坏了，床和枕头上有着干涸的血迹，上面还盖着看似干净的衣服。房间里有一个迷你冰箱，上面放着半打药物。角落里，一个装满血迹斑斑绷带的纸箱藏在阴影中。

Shinji walked to the far-end corner of the room, facing the wall, and waited. Moments later he could hear the noise of bathroom door opening behind him; he started, "Ayanami?"  
真嗣走向房间的尽头，面对着墙角等待。片刻后，他听到身后浴室门打开的声音；他一惊，“绫波？”

"Yes, Pilot Ikari?" Came a monotoned reply.  
“是的，碇司令？”传来一个单调的回答。

"Put some clothes on first, please," Shinji said as he kept staring at the wall.  
“请先穿上衣服，”真嗣说着，继续盯着墙壁。

"Why? I'm only in my natural state," came the same cold voice. "Do you not wish to see me in my natural form?"  
"为什么？我只是处于我的自然状态，" 那个冷冰冰的声音再次响起。"你不想看看我的自然形态吗？"

"Not exactly, but yeah," Shinji sweatdropped. Maybe he should have waited outside her room for her to get ready first.  
"不完全是，但也可以这么说，" 真嗣汗颜。也许他应该先在外面等她准备好。

Shinji turned around after the rustling sound of wearing clothes subsided. Ayanami wore her usual school uniform, walking toward the door, completely ignoring the presence of another person in her room.  
真嗣在衣物摩擦声停止后转过身来。绫波穿着她平常的校服，走向门口，完全无视了房间里还有另一个人。

"Ayanami!" Shinji called out, Rei stopped and turned around, "yes, Pilot Ikari?"  
"绫波!" 真嗣喊道，绫波停下脚步转过身来，"是的，碇司令？"

"You can call me Shinji, I call you Ayanami, right?"  
"你可以叫我真嗣，我叫你绫波，对吧？"

"That's…agreeable, Shinji-kun."  
"那样……可以的，真嗣君。"

"Also," Shinji took out Rei's new ID card, "you need this to get into Geofront."  
"还有，" 真嗣拿出绫波的新身份证，"你需要这个才能进入地底都市。"

Rei took the card without another word; just as she was about to turn around and leave, Shinji called her again, "Ayanami, we're friends, right? Do you know what friends are for?"  
绫波接过卡片，一言不发；正当她准备转身离开时，真嗣再次叫住她，"绫波，我们是朋友，对吧？你知道朋友是用来做什么的吗？"

"A friend is a person who you know well and who you like a lot, but who is usually not a member of your family, nor engaging in sexual activities with you." Rei replied instantly, "am I correct?"  
"朋友是一个你非常了解且喜欢的人，但他通常既不是你的家人，也不与你发生性关系。" 绫波立刻回答道，"我说的对吗？"

"Right, but there's more to that," Shinji let out a breath, "for us pilots, we need to watch out for each other in combat. We fight together, and we keep each other safe."  
“对，但这只是其中一部分，”真嗣呼出一口气，“作为驾驶员，我们在战斗中需要互相照应。我们并肩作战，保护彼此的安全。”

"Your proposition is…acceptable," Rei answered after a moment of musing, "I will protect my friends in battles."  
“你的提议……可以接受，”绫波沉思片刻后回答，“我会在战斗中保护我的朋友。”

Shinji sighed in relief as Rei exited the room. It was easier than he expected since he didn't have time to appropriately interact with Rei this time; he was preoccupied with the unexpected early arrival of the redhead. Still, the result was constructive, to say the least. This way he wouldn't be worried about Ramiel fight anymore, right?  
看着绫波离开房间，真嗣松了口气。这比他预想的要简单，毕竟这次他没有足够的时间与绫波好好交流；他正忙于应对红发少女的意外提前到来。不过，至少结果是积极的。这样一来，他就不必再为对抗雷米尔的战斗担心了，对吧？

Shinji felt a chill ran down his spine as he stepped inside Commander Ikari's office. He was never a fan of taking tourist trips here, but he didn't have any other options. He needed a safe and private place to plan and negotiate with his father, after all. And no other place on earth was more suitable than here.  
真嗣走进碇司令的办公室时，感到一股寒意沿着脊背直下。他从来不喜欢来这里‘观光’，但别无选择。毕竟，他需要一个安全私密的地方与父亲策划和谈判。而地球上没有比这里更合适的地方了。

"Pilot, anything important?" A cold and stern voice echoed in the room.  
“驾驶员，有什么重要的事吗？”一个冷酷而严厉的声音在房间里回荡。

"Yes, father," Shinji replied, "first, I want a change of Ayanami's accommodation."  
“是的，父亲，”真嗣回答，“首先，我希望更换绫波的住处。”

"Denied," Gendo said instantly, "that's outside of our deal."  
"拒绝," 源渡立刻说道，"这超出了我们的协议。"

"But she lives in a literal garbage dump," Shinji raised his volume, "at least treat her like a human!"  
"但她住在垃圾堆里啊，" 真嗣提高了音量，"至少把她当人对待！"

"Her accommodation is more suitable than necessary," Gendo continued, "I have my own reasons, and I'm sure you know which, to keep her living there."  
"她的住处比必要的还要合适，" 源渡继续说，"我有自己的理由，而且我相信你知道是哪些，让她住在那里。"

Shinji pondered for a moment. His father, as insightful, smart, and sensitive as he was, saw right through him as if he was transparent. He indeed knew why Gendo kept Rei living in a remote wasteland - to avoid her from gaining more personalities and emotions that might introduce unnecessary risks to the scenario.  
真嗣沉思片刻。他的父亲，如同洞察秋毫、聪慧且敏感，一眼就看穿了他，仿佛他是透明的一般。他确实知道源堂为何让绫波住在偏远的荒地上——为了避免她获得更多人格和情感，这些可能会给计划带来不必要的风险。

Deprogramming Gendo Ikari's little robot had always been one of his most urgent tasks in all of his earlier cycles since he knew Rei was a crucial part of the success of Ikari's scenario. However, in this life, his father knew about his status from the very beginning, which insinuated he would definitely watch closely about the interactions between him and Rei, given Gendo's untrusting persona.  
重新编程碇源堂的小机器人一直是他在所有早期循环中最紧迫的任务之一，因为他知道绫波是碇计划成功的关键部分。然而，在这一世，他的父亲从一开始就知道他的状态，这暗示着鉴于碇的不信任性格，他肯定会密切关注他与绫波之间的互动。

Shinji silently swore, feeling sorry toward Rei since he suspected he couldn't do much about her emotionless state this time. But he could only apologize to himself.  
真嗣默默发誓，对绫波感到抱歉，因为他怀疑这次自己无法为她无情感的状态做些什么。但他只能向自己道歉。

Afer all, he owed to Asuka, but not Rei.  
毕竟，他欠明日香，但不欠绫波。

"But the buildings there were about to collapse!" Still, he tried, "and it did, before!"  
“但那里的建筑快要倒塌了！”他仍试图辩解，“之前也确实倒塌过！”

"If she dies, she can be replaced," Gendo's voice lowered the temperature of the room by a fraction of a degree, "you should be perfectly aware of that."  
“如果她死了，可以被替换，”碇源堂的声音让房间的温度下降了几分，“你应该非常清楚这一点。”

"Father," Shinji matched his father's, "yes, I know about her nature, which means I also know she's the closest of a family to me other than you in this world, to you as well. Do you really not care about her well-being at all? I'm not even asking for the impossible, just...get her out of the shithole. Wherever is okay."  
"父亲，" 真嗣语气与父亲相仿，"是的，我了解她的本质，这意味着我也知道她是这个世界上除了你之外最亲近我的家人，对你也是如此。你真的完全不在乎她的安危吗？我甚至不是在要求不可能的事，只是……让她离开那个鬼地方。任何地方都行。"

Gendo pondered. The image of Rei emerged in his mind - then it overlapped with Yui. His heart fluttered. "I see. I'll get her new accommodation inside Geofront. The position is irrelevant to you. No more room for negotiations." Seeing Shinji nodded with an understanding and appreciative smile, he continued, "is there anything else?"  
碇源堂沉思着。丽的形象在他脑海中浮现——然后与唯重叠。他的心微微颤动。"我明白了。我会给她在 Geofront 安排新的住处。位置与你无关。没有更多谈判的余地。"看到真嗣点头，带着理解和感激的微笑，他继续问道，"还有其他事吗？"

"Yes. The next Angel...is coming. It's powerful. I don't want people to get hurt, especially Asuka. And I know how to defeat it, so I need your cooperation."  
"是的。下一个使徒……即将来袭。它很强大。我不希望有人受伤，尤其是明日香。而且我知道如何击败它，所以我需要你的配合。"

"I'm listening," Gendo perked up his ears.  
"我在听着呢，" 源渡竖起了耳朵。

The monitor flashed bright light as the self-propelled particle cannon exploded, making several people on the bridge gasp at the destructive power exhibited by the looked-innocuous blue octahedron. Misato silently blessed the fact that the Commander demanded to test out the Angel's capabilities before engaging it with an EVA, which now looked to be a brilliant choice.  
监视器上闪烁着耀眼的光芒，自走粒子炮爆炸的瞬间，让桥上的几个人因那看似无害的蓝色八面体所展现的破坏力而倒吸一口凉气。美里默默庆幸指挥官要求在用 EVA 对付使徒之前先测试其能力，现在看来这是一个明智的决定。

Shinji gripped the controls of his EVA tightly as a clearly annoyed voice came through the comm channel, "oh c'mon, why are we still not being deployed yet?"  
真嗣紧紧握住 EVA 的操纵杆，通讯频道中传来一个明显不耐烦的声音："哦，拜托，我们为什么还不能出动？"

"Be patient, Asuka, in case you haven't noticed the Angel just vaporized half of a hill with a single shot," Shinji shook his head, trying to shake off unhelpful imaginary scenes, where his favorite girl was there being shot at.  
“耐心点，明日香，你可能没注意到，那个使徒刚刚一击就蒸发了半个山头，”真嗣摇了摇头，试图摆脱那些无益的幻想场景，在那里，他最喜欢的女孩正被枪击。

"Hmph, I bet you just don't want me to take the ki-wait the Angel did WHAT?"  
“哼，我打赌你只是不想让我拿走那个——等等，使徒做了什么？”

Shinji chuckled and turned off the video feed.  
真嗣轻笑一声，关闭了视频源。

"Okay we need to think," Misato said after she came down from her state of shock, "Tactical analysis."  
"好吧，我们需要思考，" 美里从震惊中回过神来说道，"战术分析。"

"After an analysis using dummies and live weapons, the Angel is surmised to take out any perceived threat within a 7,500m radius."  
"通过使用假人和实弹武器进行分析，推测使徒会在 7,500 米半径内消灭任何感知到的威胁。"

"So, close quarters combat is off the table then." Misato concluded, spinning the pen, "what is MAGI suggesting?"  
"那么，近战格斗就不考虑了。" 美里总结道，旋转着笔，"MAGI 有什么建议？"

"MAGI suggested we self-destruct NERV HQ, Captain."  
"MAGI 建议我们自行销毁 NERV 总部，舰长。"

"Captain, we do have a time limit for response. Its drill is currently working through the second armor plate now. With a bore of 17.5m it could theoretically drop its AT-Field long enough, or collapse to a small enough form to slip down here and destroy us."  
"舰长，我们的响应时间有限。它的钻头目前正在穿透第二层装甲板。直径 17.5 米的钻头理论上可以暂时降低 AT 力场，或者缩小到足够小的形态潜入这里摧毁我们。"

"We only have 24 of the 25 armor belts installed, and at its current rate of penetration gives us only 11 hours 17 minutes until it breaks through. According to the MAGI, at 6 minutes 54 seconds past midnight, the Angel will have broken through our defenses."  
"我们只安装了 25 层装甲带中的 24 层，按照目前的穿透速度，我们只剩下 11 小时 17 分钟就会突破。根据 MAGI 的计算，在午夜过后 6 分钟 54 秒，使徒将突破我们的防线。"

"We have two working Evangelions, Unit 01 and Unit 02. Unit 00 hasn't been calibrated for combat yet."  
"我们有两台可用的 EVA，零壹号机和零贰号机。零零号机尚未完成战斗校准。"

"Things aren't looking great for us are they? And we can't let it get down here, otherwise we'd be at its mercy." Misato massaged her temple, "what options do we even have to fight?"  
"情况对我们不太有利，是吧？而且我们不能让它降落到地面，否则我们就只能任其摆布了。" 美里揉着太阳穴，"我们还有什么办法可以对抗呢？"

"Well, we always have the option to send up a white flag, Captain." Hyuga half laughed.  
"嗯，我们总可以升起白旗投降，舰长。" 日向半开玩笑地说道。"

"Hell no." Misato said. "I don't believe in a no-win scenario."  
"绝对不行。" 美里说，"我不相信有什么必输的局面。"

"Misato, this isn't a simulation you can cheat," Ritsuko said with amusement. "And you're no James T. Kirk. We don't really have many options."  
"美里，这不是你能作弊的模拟训练，" 律子带着几分戏谑地说，"你也不是詹姆斯·T·柯克。我们真的没有太多选择。"

"Well, we can't attack it up close or at range." Misato slammed her hand down hard on the table, "How about at extreme range? Let's snipe the fucker!"  
"好吧，我们不能近距离攻击，也不能远距离攻击。" 美里重重地拍了一下桌子，"那极远距离呢？我们远程狙击那家伙！"

"With what exactly?" “具体用什么？”

"Erm, let me think-" “呃，让我想想——”

"I believe a high-powered, external source, Positron Beam Rifle that the JSSDF is working on should suffice, Captain," a stony voice drew the attention of everyone on the bridge. Following the sound, they saw Commander Ikari looking down at them with a stern look.  
“我认为，日本自卫队正在研发的高能外部电源阳电子炮应该足够了，舰长，”一个冷硬的声音吸引了舰桥上所有人的注意。顺着声音望去，他们看到碇司令正俯视着他们，神情严肃。

"Commander…but we'll need the power of entire Japan to pierce its AT-Field!" Ritsuko exclaimed, "How do we plan on getting the power necessary?"  
“指挥官……但我们需借助整个日本的电力才能穿透它的 AT 力场！”律子惊呼，“我们如何获取所需的能量？”

"We'll have a national-wide blackout and shunt all the power to the rifle, we can set up transformers temporarily to transfer the power to the best position to snipe it from, just outside its weapons range."  
“我们将实施全国范围的停电，并将所有电力转移到狙击枪上，可以临时搭建变压器，将电力传输到最佳狙击位置，就在其武器射程之外。”

"But-" "但——"

"It's an order, follow it." Commander cut her off with a voice that left no room for negotiation.  
“这是命令，执行吧。”指挥官以不容商榷的语气打断了她。

"…so that's the plan. Any questions?" Misato looked at the Children with an inscrutable expression; the plan sounded insane, but she somehow liked it. Seeing both the Second and Third Children shook their heads, she continued, "good. One of you will take the shot-"  
“…所以这就是计划。有什么问题吗？”美里用一种难以捉摸的表情看着孩子们；这个计划听起来疯狂，但她不知为何却喜欢它。看到二号和三号适格者都摇了摇头，她继续说道，“很好。你们中的一个将执行射击——”

"Pick me pick me!" Asuka raised her hand, jumping. It should be easy – aim and kill. Handling a sniper rifle in an EVA was a subject she had been strictly trained on; she had the confidence to take the point.  
“选我选我！”明日香举起手，跳了起来。这应该很简单——瞄准并击杀。在 EVA 中使用狙击步枪是她经过严格训练的科目；她有信心担任这个任务。

"I'll do it," Shinji stated, his voice firm. After all, he had shot and killed the Angel countless times, to the extent he could kill it with one shot, not needing so much as Ayanami's protection. He didn't know how good Asuka was at shooting rifles, but he was sure he could do it impeccably.  
“我来吧，”真嗣坚定地说道。毕竟，他已经无数次射击并杀死了使徒，甚至可以一击必杀，不需要绫波的保护。他不知道明日香狙击步枪的水平如何，但他确信自己能完美完成任务。

"No you're not! This kill is mine, Third!" Asuka frowned, "I'm the one with more training on rifles!"  
"不，你不是！这个击杀是我的，三号！" 明日香皱眉，"我在步枪训练上比你多得多！"

"Shinji, Asuka's right. She had a lot more training on the subject than you." Asuka smirked superciliously as she heard Misato's words.  
"真嗣，明日香说得对。她在这一领域的训练比你多得多。" 明日香听到美里的话后，得意地扬起了嘴角。

"But-" "但——"

"It's alright Shinji, she can handle it," Misato reassured, "you have your own job, though. We've jury-rigged a shield from the bottom of one of the United Nations Space Administration's Explorer Class Shuttles. It's 10 cm of titanium-tungsten alloy, covered in heat-resistant carbon-carbon tiles, and has been coated five times with an ultra-dense electromagnetic dissipating coating. It can withstand the enemy's attack for an estimated 15 to 17 seconds."  
"没关系，真嗣，她能应付得来，" 美里安慰道，"不过你有你自己的任务。我们从联合国太空管理局的一艘探索级穿梭机底部临时改装了一块盾牌。它由 10 厘米厚的钛钨合金制成，覆盖着耐热碳碳瓦片，并涂了五层超密集电磁散逸涂层。预计能抵挡敌人的攻击 15 到 17 秒。"

"So I'm on defense?" Shinji asked in dismay – but worrying internally.  
"所以我是防守方？" 真嗣沮丧地问道——内心却感到担忧。

"Essentially." "基本上是。"

"Ha, getting defense from the invincible Shinji-sama! I'm ever so grateful!" Asuka scorned, "not that I needed your defense in the first place!"  
"哈，从无敌的真嗣大人那里得到防守！我真是感激不尽！" 明日香嘲讽道，"不过我本来就不需要你的防守！"

In a short while, Shinji couldn't even decide whether he should be happy to hear that.  
不久之后，真嗣甚至无法确定他是否应该为此感到高兴。

All across the country, the lights began to blink out of existence, as it was plunged into darkness, as the power was transferred to NERV's control from the next 6 hours. The electrical machinery on site began to hum to life, and static could be felt in the air. On the temporary cage near the Entry Plugs, Asuka and Rei were sitting and watching as Tokyo–3 went dark from their respective platforms.  
全国各地的灯光开始逐一熄灭，因为电力在接下来的六小时内被转移到 NERV 的控制下，整个城市陷入了黑暗。现场的电气设备开始嗡嗡作响，空气中能感受到静电。在靠近插入栓的临时笼子里，明日香和绫波坐在各自的平台上，看着第三新东京市逐渐变暗。

"First Child? What are you doing here?" Asuka probed, "I thought you are not being deployed in this sortie."  
“第一适任者？你在这里做什么？”明日香问道，“我以为这次任务没有安排你。”

"I'm here as backup in case you fail."  
"我是来当后备的，万一你失败了。"

"More like in case we're dead…" Asuka muttered sadly before a confident smirk emerged on her face, "but don't worry, you won't have a chance to deploy! I'll take care of this one!"  
"更像是万一我们挂了……" 明日香悲伤地嘀咕着，随即脸上浮现出自信的微笑，"不过别担心，你没机会出手的！我会搞定这个的！"

"Do you trust Ikari-kun?" Rei suddenly asked.  
"你相信碇君吗？" 绫波突然问道。"

Asuka's brows furrowed, "what? I mean, I guess I could trust him in combat. He's such a wonderboy isn't he!"  
明日香皱起眉头，“什么？我是说，我想我可以信任他在战斗中的表现。他不就是个奇迹小子吗！”

"He was designated to protect you, is he not?" Rei continued.  
“他被指派来保护你，不是吗？”绫波继续说道。

"Yeah, but I don't need it!"  
“是啊，但我并不需要！”

"Is he your friend?" "他是你的朋友吗？"

"What?" Asuka's frown deepened. She'd never thought Ayanami would be willing to respond to her questions, let alone actively forwarding a conversation. "I…I don't know." She replied after several long seconds, her voice carried a great uncertainty.  
"什么？" 明日香的眉头皱得更深了。她从未想过绫波会愿意回应她的问题，更不用说主动推进对话了。"我……我不知道。" 她回答道，声音中带着极大的不确定。

"Ikari-kun said friends protect others in battles, if he's willing to protect you, he must consider you as a friend. I deem him as a friend, so I will protect him." Rei continued in a flat voice, "we're friends as well, Pilot Soryu. Therefore, I will protect you as well."  
"碇君说过，朋友在战斗中保护他人，如果他愿意保护你，那他一定把你当作朋友。我把他视为朋友，所以我会保护他。" 绫波继续用平淡的语气说道，"我们也是朋友，飞行员惣流。因此，我也会保护你。"

Asuka blinked as she failed to process what her brain told her she had heard. Did Rei…just said she was willing to put herself at risk in battles to protect her? That couldn't be right. Even though they were 'friends', but that's only for convenience, at least in Asuka's eyes. The truth was they barely interacted with each other. Why would she be willing to do that? "Fir-Ayanami, just tell me why do you pilot the god damn EVA?!"  
明日香眨了眨眼，她的大脑告诉她刚刚听到的内容让她难以置信。绫波……刚刚说她愿意在战斗中冒险保护她？这不可能。尽管她们是“朋友”，但在明日香看来，那只是出于方便。实际上，她们几乎没有什么互动。她为什么会愿意这样做？“绫波，告诉我，你为什么要驾驶这该死的 EVA？！”

"Because it is a bond," Rei replied, her expression inscrutable.  
“因为这是一种羁绊。”绫波回答，表情深不可测。

"Bond?" Asuka raised an eyebrow, "To whom?"  
“羁绊？”明日香挑了挑眉，“对谁？”

"I have nothing else…" Rei said solemnly. "I feel like I was born to pilot an Evangelion. If I stopped being a pilot, then my life would no longer have purpose. I'd have nothing else to live for, and that's the same as being dead."  
"我别无他物……" 绫波说得很严肃。"我觉得自己生来就是为了驾驶 EVA。如果我不再是驾驶员，那我的生活就失去了意义。我将无所寄托，那与死亡无异。"

"The same as being dead?" Asuka felt a chill ran down her spine. Her life sounded disturbingly familiar…  
"与死亡无异？" 明日香感到一阵寒意窜上脊背。她的生活听起来令人不安地熟悉……

Rei looked up at the stars. "Pilot Soryu… its time." Rei said calmly, the full moon framed behind her, "you should go."  
绫波抬头望向星空。"明日香驾驶员……时候到了。" 绫波平静地说，满月在她身后映衬，"你该走了。"

Asuka stared at Ayanami's slender form disappeared around the corner of the stairs, a storm of thoughts rampaging in her mind.  
明日香盯着绫波纤细的身影消失在楼梯拐角处，心中思绪如风暴般肆虐。

Asuka crouched in position as the sniper, while Shinji and Unit 01 stood a short distance away, holding the shield that may have to defend her if she missed. It was now midnight, and everyone was putting all their faith into Asuka, the child prodigy, the supposed most trained pilot of EVA. The crimson unit was facing down, holding the Positron Rifle in its hands. Behind it were nine dischargers that would send the burst of power to the rifle.  
明日香蹲伏在狙击位置，而真嗣和初号机则站在不远处，手持盾牌以防她失手时保护她。此刻已是午夜，所有人都将希望寄托在明日香这位神童、号称 EVA 最训练有素的驾驶员身上。赤红机体低垂着头，手中握着阳电子步枪。其背后是九个释放器，将能量爆发输送至步枪。

Shinji took several deep breaths as the timer continued to countdown. Only he knew how dangerous it was as the sniper. In his first few samsara, every time he crouched behind that Positron rifle was a life-and-death situation for him. Now Asuka was at the position; he didn't want to see her get hurt by the blast that could vaporize an entire city block within seconds.  
真嗣深吸了几口气，计时器仍在倒数。只有他知道作为狙击手的危险性。在他最初的几次轮回中，每次蹲在那把阳电子步枪后对他来说都是生死攸关的时刻。如今明日香站在那个位置；他不愿看到她被能在几秒内气化整个街区的爆炸所伤。

If he simply didn't want to see her harmed by Angels, he could tell his father to keep her in Germany and never come to Tokyo-3, right?  
如果他只是不想让她被使徒伤害，他完全可以告诉父亲让她留在德国，永远不要来第三新东京市，对吧？

He shook his head. He knew physical injuries were only gentle breezes for her, while mental sufferings were tornadoes.  
他摇了摇头。他知道，对她来说，身体上的伤害不过是微风拂面，而精神上的痛苦才是狂风暴雨。

That time when she lost her EVA and her status as the Second Child…  
那次她失去了 EVA，也失去了二号机驾驶员的身份……

_"Asuka! Here you are-" "明日香！你在这里——"_

_The bathtub. It was full of red. Not only her hair.  
浴缸。里面一片鲜红。不仅仅是她的头发。_

He would never let that happen to her ever again.  
他绝不会再让那样的事情发生在她身上。

"Asuka, whatever happens out there, thank you for trying your best. That's all I can ever ask for," Misato said to Asuka over the comm.  
"明日香，无论外面发生什么，谢谢你尽了全力。这就是我唯一能要求的，" 美里通过通讯对明日香说道。

"Don't worry, I've been training for this for most of my life!" Asuka said as she breathed deeply.  
"别担心，我大半辈子都在为这个训练！" 明日香深呼吸着说道。

"Commence Operation Yashima!"  
"开始执行'八咫乌'行动！"

"Prepare the Positron Beam Rifle for firing, initiate power grid connections!"  
"准备发射正电子光束步枪，启动电源网络连接！"

"All regions now switching to primary and secondary substation systems… throwing all switches… transferring power now."  
"所有区域正在切换至主次变电站系统……抛出所有开关……现在进行电力转移。"

"Switches activated… all power generator facilities are operating at 100%… reading for max output limit… activating first stage connections… all transmission lines are powered and stable… voltage and current is steady."  
"开关已激活……所有发电设施正以 100%运行……准备达到最大输出限制……激活第一阶段连接……所有输电线路已通电且稳定……电压和电流保持恒定。"

"Go ahead everyone, all the way!"  
"大家继续前进，一直走！"

"Activating stage two connections… substations online… power transmission is maintaining maximum voltage… activating cooling system for stage three connections… releasing primary safeties on Positron Rifle… stage three connections are stable."  
"启动第二阶段连接…子站上线…电力传输保持最高电压…启动第三阶段连接的冷却系统…释放阳电子步枪的主要安全装置…第三阶段连接稳定。"

"Good," Misato said. "Now, activate the AIS and target the Angel to distract it as planned."  
"很好，"美里说。"现在，启动 AIS 并按计划瞄准使徒以分散其注意力。"

The weapons encampments from outside the city limits activated and opened fire on Ramiel with several hundred cruise missiles. The massive barrage did nothing as Ramiel released a beam that swept across the night sky, intercepting and destroying every missile before they even came close to it. It then fired on one of the missile launches, vaporizing the side of the hill.  
城外武器营地启动，向拉米埃尔发射了数百枚巡航导弹。然而，拉米埃尔释放出一道横扫夜空的巨大光束，在导弹接近之前就将其全部拦截并摧毁。随后，它瞄准其中一个导弹发射点，将山坡一侧瞬间蒸发。

"Stage four connections open and stable… voltage is still at maximum… ready for stage five connections ultra-high power discharge system."  
第四阶段连接开启并稳定…电压仍处于最大值…准备进行第五阶段连接超高压放电系统。

"Release final safety locks."  
解除最终安全锁。

"Load the fuse! Activate the Type–G equipment!"  
"装载引信！激活 G 型装备！"

A massive sight folded down in front of Unit 02's right eyes, and a large dish measured the system's precision as it locked on.  
一个巨大的瞄准镜在二号机右眼前展开，一个大型碟形装置测量着系统的精度，随着锁定目标而调整。

"Final safety locks released! The rifle is ready to fire!"  
"最终安全锁已解除！步枪准备发射！"

"Completing firing solution, compensation for gravity, rotation, and magnetic field at +0.0009… fire control system is online… cooling systems on standby… stage four capacitors at 97.3%… 97.8%… 98.3%… 98.9%… 99.5%… 99.9%… 100%… charged and ready for final transfer…"  
"完成射击解决方案，补偿重力、旋转和磁场影响，修正值为+0.0009…火控系统已上线…冷却系统待命…第四阶段电容器充能至 97.3%…97.8%…98.3%…98.9%…99.5%…99.9%…100%…已充满，准备最终传输…"

"Activate stage five connections! Transferring all power to stage five ultrahigh discharge system… finalizing adjustment for Positron Rifle… commencing final countdown… 12… 11… 10… 9… 8… 7… 6… 5…"  
"激活第五阶段连接！将所有能量转移至第五阶段超高放电系统…正电子步枪最终调整…开始倒计时…12…11…10…9…8…7…6…5…"

Asuka was listening intently from inside the Entry Plug. "3… 2… 1… FIRE!" Misato shouted.  
明日香在插入栓内全神贯注地听着。“3…2…1…开火！”美里大喊道。

The target lined up and indicated a lock on the Core. "Take this you ugly, geometric bastard!" Asuka pulled the trigger. The dischargers behind Unit 02 flashed, and Positron Rifle fired a bright green burst of energy towards Ramiel's exposed Core. The shot impacted the side of the Core, causing Ramiel to splinter into a massive starburst shape and sprayed blood everywhere. He began to sink, then slowly, the wound healed, and Ramiel reformed.  
目标排列并指示锁定核心。“接招吧，你这丑陋的几何怪物！”明日香扣动扳机。二号机背后的放电器闪烁，阳电子步枪射出一道明亮的绿色能量束，直奔雷米尔暴露的核心。射击击中核心侧面，雷米尔随即碎裂成巨大的星爆形态，鲜血四溅。它开始下沉，随后伤口缓慢愈合，雷米尔重新凝聚。

"What the fuck?! That was a perfect shot!" Asuka said in exasperation.  
“搞什么鬼？！那可是完美的一击！”明日香恼怒地说。

In an instant counterattack, Ramiel changed forms into an unfolding five-pointed star, unfolding continuously until the beam was charged. With a high–pitched whine, it fired the massive bright purple blast towards Unit 02 and the temporary base.  
雷米尔瞬间反击，变形为不断展开的五角星，持续展开直至充能完毕。随着一声尖锐的嗡鸣，它向二号机和临时基地发射出巨大的亮紫色光束。

"Oh Shit!" Asuka shouted, raising her arms in a futile attempt to block the inevitable.  
“该死！”明日香大喊着，徒劳地举起双臂试图阻挡那不可避免的冲击。

Shinji grabbed the shield and sprung to his feet, jumping in front of Unit 02 and raised the shield. It was earlier than Ayanami did – but he couldn't stand to see Asuka getting burned by the destructive particle beam.  
真嗣抓起盾牌，一跃而起，跳到二号机前举起盾牌。这比绫波早了一步——但他无法忍受看到明日香被那毁灭性的粒子束烧伤。

Asuka opened her eyes, just to see the particle beam was intercepted and deflected into several strands by the shield that was quickly melting away. The high-energy protons collided with the substance of the shield, disintegrating it into dust, reducing it to atoms. "Shinji!" She shouted into the comms, "hold on! Misato, how long until ready again?!"  
明日香睁开眼睛，只见粒子束被盾牌拦截并分散成几股，盾牌正迅速融化。高能质子与盾牌物质碰撞，将其分解成尘埃，化为原子。“真嗣！”她对着通讯器喊道，“坚持住！美里，还要多久才能再次准备就绪？！”

"30 seconds!" "30 秒！"

The Angel temporarily ceased fire; the shield was gone entirely, leaving a defenseless Unit 01 in front of Unit 02.  
天使暂时停止了攻击；护盾已完全消失，留下毫无防备的零号机面对二号机。

From the command deck, everyone held their breaths as the scene displayed on the screen. Misato clutched the cross around her neck. "Asuka… I know you can do this. You have all the power of Japan behind you. Everyone out there knows you can do this. We all believe in you, Asuka." In the Entry Plug, Asuka flipped the switch controlling the Type–G equipment to off. "Asuka, you've switched off the targeting components," said Misato in a worried voice, "Is everything okay?"  
从指挥舱内，所有人都屏息凝视着屏幕上的景象。美里紧握着胸前的十字架。“明日香…我知道你能做到。你拥有整个日本的力量支持着你。外面的每一个人都知道你能做到。我们都相信你，明日香。”在插入栓内，明日香关闭了 G 型设备的控制开关。“明日香，你关闭了瞄准组件，”美里担忧地问道，“一切都还好吗？”

"You said you trusted me, Misato," Asuka replied, "I can make this shot. The computer missed once, we can't afford a second miss. We may not survive this." Asuka breathed deeply.  
"你说过你信任我，美里，" 明日香回答，"我能做到这一击。电脑已经失误了一次，我们承受不起第二次失误。我们可能无法在这场战斗中幸存。" 明日香深呼吸了一口气。

"The drill has penetrated the Geofront!" Hyuga reported. "Barrel cooled… exchanging fuses… capacitors at 89%… 30 seconds till we can fire… all fire controls have been transferred to the pilot!"  
"钻头已经穿透了地底城！" 日向报告道，"枪管冷却中……更换保险丝……电容器达到 89%……30 秒后可以开火……所有火力控制已转移给驾驶员！"

"Power levels spiking again, ma'am!" Maya shouted, her eyes glued on the readings on the monitor, "It's going to fire!"  
"能量水平再次飙升，女士！" 真希波喊道，她的眼睛紧盯着监视器上的读数，"它要开火了！"

With a blinding flash of light, the Angel fired its beam at the shield-less Unit 01, although its target was the crimson EVA behind it. "AHHHH!" Shinji screamed in agony as LCL around him boiled. He tried to put up the strongest AT-Field he could muster, but it did little to deflect the destructive power. _'I need to think of-AHHHH!'_  
"随着一道刺眼的光芒闪现，使徒向没有护盾的初号机发射了光束，尽管其真正的目标是背后的赤红 EVA。“啊啊啊！”真嗣痛苦地尖叫着，周围的 LCL 沸腾起来。他试图施展出自己能凝聚的最强 AT 力场，但这几乎无法偏转那毁灭性的力量。‘我得想个办法——啊啊啊！’”

_"See, the positrons and the beam of the Angel repel each other, which means the Angel used positively charged particles as well." Asuka explained, "you need to pay attention in classes, Baka-Shinji!"  
“看，使徒的光束和正电子相互排斥，这意味着使徒也使用了带正电的粒子。”明日香解释道，“你上课得专心点，笨蛋真嗣！”_

Shinji maneuvered his AT-Field, changing it into a specific phase frequency, mimicking a magnetic field. The plan partially worked as part of the protons in the beam was redirected by the magnetic field, dissipating into the air. However, the umbilical cable of Unit 01 was long gone, and the internal battery wouldn't last long.  
真嗣操控着 AT 力场，将其转变为特定的相位频率，模仿出一个磁场。这个计划部分奏效了，光束中的一部分质子被磁场偏转，消散在空气中。然而，初号机的脐带电缆早已不复存在，内部电池也支撑不了多久。

"SHINJI!" Asuka shouted as the sound of Shinji screaming stung her heart, "Come on! Charge already you piece of shit!" She continued to line up the shot, and was doing his best to do it through the beam's intense light and heat. She locked onto the Core manually, and the indicator flashed, signaling the capacitors were charged. "Yippie–Ki–Yay, motherfucker!" Asuka cried as she pulled the trigger. The dischargers behind Unit 02 flashed again, and Positron Rifle fired a bright green burst of energy through Ramiel's bright purple beam, overpowering it. The shot traveled right at Ramiel's exposed Core and hit dead center, blowing right through it and its S2 Engine. Ramiel burst once more into the massive starburst shape and sprayed blood everywhere, leaking from every spindle and point on the starburst. The Angel began to sink slowly to the ground and then, with a high–pitched scream, collapsed into a pile of blood, leaving a massive bloodstain behind. "She did it!" Misato shouted. "Asuka, you did it!"  
"真嗣！" 明日香大喊，真嗣的尖叫声刺痛了她的心，"快点！充电啊，该死的！" 她继续瞄准，尽管要在光束的强烈光芒和高温中做到这一点非常困难。她手动锁定了核心，指示灯闪烁，表示电容器已充满电。"耶比基耶，混蛋！" 明日香喊着扣下了扳机。02 号机背后的放电器再次闪烁，阳电子步枪发射出一束明亮的绿色能量，穿透了拉米尔的亮紫色光束，将其压倒。这一击直奔拉米尔暴露的核心，正中靶心，贯穿了核心及其 S2 引擎。拉米尔再次爆炸成巨大的星形，鲜血四溅，从星形上的每一个纺锤和尖端喷涌而出。天使开始缓缓下沉，随后伴随着一声尖锐的惨叫，倒塌成一滩血泊，留下了一大片血迹。"她做到了！" 美里喊道，"明日香，你做到了！"

The said girl had no time to listen to the cheers and congrats that flooded the comm channel. Shinji's screams were already long subsided. She threw the rifle away and jumped to her feet, rushing forward to where Unit 01 lay on the ground. The purple EVA Unit was a mangled mess; its frontal armor plates were melted and burned black. She couldn't even recognize the shape of it.  
那女孩无暇顾及通讯频道中涌入的欢呼与祝贺。真嗣的尖叫声早已平息。她扔掉步枪，一跃而起，冲向初号机倒地之处。紫色的 EVA 机体已是一片狼藉；其正面装甲板熔化烧焦，黑迹斑斑。她甚至无法辨认出它的形状。

"No no no no no…" she shut off the comm channel, "you can't die…you can't die!" She felt a cold ball growing inside her stomach. This boy…her rival, her competition, just sacrificed himself to save her? Why? Did he consider her a friend? If they switched places, she wasn't sure what she would do. She would probably run away and let him burn under the beam the moment her shield broke.  
“不不不不不……”她关闭了通讯频道，“你不能死……你不能死！”她感到一股寒意在胃中凝结。这个男孩……她的对手，她的竞争者，刚刚竟牺牲自己来救她？为什么？他把她当朋友吗？如果角色互换，她不确定自己会怎么做。她可能会在盾牌破碎的瞬间逃跑，任由他在光束下燃烧。

Asuka owed him a life. And she wouldn't have the chance to pay him back.  
明日香欠他一条命。而她将没有机会偿还。

Asuka crouched down to her knees beside Unit 01 and punched the emergency eject button. The second the hatch popped open, the Entry Plug popped out, spraying out its steaming LCL through the emergency vents. She gently removed the Entry Plug, and placed it on the ground, exposing the emergency hatch.  
明日香蹲在初号机旁边，猛击紧急弹射按钮。舱门一弹开，驾驶舱便弹了出来，通过紧急通风口喷出滚烫的 LCL 液体。她轻轻地将驾驶舱移开，放在地上，露出了紧急舱门。

She got out of her EVA and dashed to the partially melted entry plug. She grabbed the butterfly handles and grasped them. "Ouch!" Asuka cried as she felt the heat through her gloves, but didn't care. She growled and bared it as she ripped the handles back and began to struggle to turn them.  
她从 EVA 中跳出，冲向部分熔化的驾驶舱。她抓住蝴蝶形把手，紧紧握住。“哎哟！”明日香感到手套下的热度，但毫不在意。她低吼一声，忍着痛猛地向后拉把手，开始费力地转动它们。

"Shinji, HOLD ON!" Asuka shouted through the hatch. After some effort, the hatch hissed, releasing a cloud of steam, finally allowin her inside. Shinji was slumped over, unconscious in his seat. "SHINJI!" Asuka screamed. "SHINJI! ARE YOU ALRIGHT?! ANSWER ME DAMN IT!"  
“真嗣，坚持住！”明日香透过舱门大喊。经过一番努力，舱门嘶嘶作响，释放出一团蒸汽，终于让她得以进入。真嗣瘫坐在座位上，不省人事。“真嗣！”明日香尖叫道，“真嗣！你还好吗？！回答我，该死的！”

Asuka didn't see any injuries on him, but he wasn't moving. She moved into the Entry Plug, and shook him gently on the shoulder. She could feel his body temperature much higher than hers through the touch. "Shinji, please wake up!" Asuka pleaded. _'No no no no no! You can't die on me! Not after I owed you so much!'_  
明日香没有在他身上发现任何伤痕，但他一动不动。她进入插入栓，轻轻摇了摇他的肩膀。通过触碰，她能感觉到他的体温比她的高得多。“真嗣，请醒醒！”明日香恳求道。‘不不不不不！你不能就这样离开我！在我欠你那么多之后！’

Asuka put her index finger under his nose, her stomach twisted as she couldn't feel him breathing. _'NO NO NO NO!'_ She moved her finger onto his carotid, sensing his pulse grew weaker and weaker with each second.  
明日香将食指放在他的鼻子下，当她感觉不到他的呼吸时，她的胃部一阵紧缩。‘不不不不！’她将手指移到他的颈动脉上，感觉到他的脉搏每秒都在变得越来越弱。

_'At least he's alive…but he's dying…I need to do something! THINK, SORYU!'_ Suddenly she recalled her first aid training; she blushed a little at the thought, but the embarrassment was nothing compared to Shinji's life.  
‘至少他还活着……但他正在死去……我需要做点什么！动脑筋，惣流！’突然，她想起了自己的急救训练；想到这里，她脸颊微微泛红，但与真嗣的生命相比，这点尴尬根本不算什么。

Asuka grabbed both of his shoulders and put gently lay him down on his back. She put one hand on top of the other, interlocking her fingers, and put them on Shinji's chest. _'Come back to me!'_ She compressed his chest with forceful pushes, trying to drag him back from the death's doorstep.  
明日香抓住他的双肩，轻轻地让他平躺下来。她将一只手叠在另一只手上，十指相扣，然后放在真嗣的胸口。'回到我身边来！' 她用力按压他的胸膛，试图将他从死亡的边缘拉回。

After 30 forceful compressions, she saw no sign of him waking up. "DAMN IT! WAKE UP!" She punched his chest hard.  
经过 30 次有力的按压后，她仍未见到他苏醒的迹象。"该死！醒过来！" 她重重地击打他的胸膛。

_'I had to this! It's the only way...'_ She took a deep breath and leaned her face closer to his. Asuka puckered up her lips, their faces merely inches from each other.  
'我不得不这么做！这是唯一的办法...' 她深吸一口气，将脸贴近他的。明日香撅起嘴唇，两人的脸庞仅相隔几英寸。

A turmoil of thoughts stormed in her mind. Would this count as a kiss? She'd never kissed anyone before, much less a boy. She had saved the opportunity for Kaji. But what gives? If she didn't do this, he would die while she could do something about it. She would forever live in guilt.  
思绪如风暴般在她脑海中肆虐。这算不算是一个吻呢？她从未吻过任何人，更别提一个男孩了。她本想把这份机会留给加持。但那又怎样？如果她不这么做，他就会在她有能力挽救的情况下死去。她将永远活在愧疚之中。

Not to mention he looked kind of cute…  
更别说他看起来还挺可爱的……

"Ah, FUCK IT," Asuka jerked her head forward. Their lips met.  
“啊，去他妈的，”明日香猛地向前一甩头。他们的唇触碰在一起。

Asuka pinched his nose to prevent air from escaping his lungs. She breathed in and out, using the corner of her eye to check the rise and fall of his lungs.  
明日香捏住他的鼻子，以防空气从他的肺部逸出。她深呼吸，用眼角余光检查他胸膛的起伏。

Suddenly Shinji's body stirred; he opened his eyes and looked up weakly, his cobalt eyes meeting her bright blue. "ARWTFGH?" Incoherent sounds came out from his throat as his eyes went wide.  
突然，真嗣的身体动了动；他睁开眼睛，虚弱地向上看去，深蓝色的眼睛与她明亮的蓝色眼睛相遇。"ARWTFGH?" 他喉咙里发出含糊不清的声音，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Ahhhh!" Asuka jumped to her feet, hastily wiping her mouth clean, her face furiously blushing. "You…nothing happened! You remember nothing!" _'YOU'RE ALIVE! Thank God!'_  
“啊！”明日香跳了起来，急忙擦干净嘴巴，脸颊因羞愤而通红。“你…什么都没发生！你什么都不记得！”‘你还活着！感谢上帝！’

Shinji smiled weakly as his brain registered the event that just transpired, "Asuka… don't worry, I won't tell anyone how good it felt to have your li-"  
真嗣虚弱地笑了笑，他的大脑刚刚记录下刚刚发生的事件，“明日香…别担心，我不会告诉任何人，你的吻感觉有多好…”

"SHUT IT," Asuka cut him off, her blush turned luminescent. Not that she's going to admit it felt nice to her as well. "Well Baka, are you feeling okay?"  
“闭嘴，”明日香打断了他，她的脸颊变得通红。她可不会承认那感觉对她来说也很美妙。“笨蛋，你感觉还好吗？”

"Yeah…aside that I'm dizzy…" Shinji moved into a sitting position, his back leaned on the side of the entry plug, "Asuka…" the redhead looked at him inscrutably, "yes?"  
“嗯…除了有点头晕…”真嗣坐起身来，背靠在插入栓的侧面，“明日香…”红发的女孩不解地看着他，“怎么了？”

"Thank you. I really do."  
"谢谢你，我真的非常感谢。"

That was it. He kept his promise. Asuka felt butterflies in her stomach as she saw his warm smile and heard his words said in a genuine tone. "Y-you're welcome, Baka-Shinji." She tilted her head, "I should thank you as well."  
就是这样。他遵守了承诺。明日香看到他温暖的笑容，听到他用真诚的语气说话，心中不禁涌起一阵悸动。“不…不用谢，笨蛋真嗣。”她微微侧头，“我也应该感谢你。”

"See…like I said, when we work together, we do great things," Shinji stuck out his hand, smiling, "so, team?"  
"看吧…就像我说的，当我们齐心协力时，我们能成就伟大的事，”真嗣伸出手，微笑着，“那么，团队合作？”

Asuka smiled back, sticking out her own hand.  
明日香回以微笑，伸出自己的手。

"Team." “团队。”

作者：抱歉更新晚了。下一章——双生火焰，碇源堂的洞察。敬请期待并留下您的评论！

## *Chapter 7*: Chapter 7: No Way Out  
*第七章*: 第七章：无路可逃

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

**Chapter 7: No Way Out  
第七章：无路可逃**

Gendo Ikari was a man outstandingly proficient in self-restraint and controlling emotions, which greatly annoyed SEELE members since it prevented them from reading his true thoughts hid behind his stony mask. As twelve black monoliths emerged around the said man, he kept his unwavering expression without so much as blinking.  
碇源堂是一个极其擅长自我克制和控制情绪的人，这让 SEELE 的成员们颇为恼火，因为这让他们无法看穿他那石像般面具下隐藏的真实想法。当十二座黑色巨碑环绕着这个男人出现时，他保持着不动声色的表情，连眼睛都不曾眨一下。

Even the old birds like SEELE members needed to hide behind 'SOUND ONLY'.  
即便是像 SEELE 成员这样的老手，也需要躲在‘仅限语音’的背后。

"Ikari, I've been informed NERV disposed of the S2 engine extracted from the Fourth Angel," SEELE 01 started, "explain yourself."  
"碇，我得知 NERV 处理了从第四使徒身上提取的 S2 引擎，" SEELE 01 开始质问，"解释一下。"

"Dr. Akagi deemed it too damaged to be useful," Gendo Ikari replied. In fact, the S2 engine recovered from the Angel of Morning, although partially damaged, was still utilizable in many means. After fierce tussling with himself, he decided to listen to Shinji, the undoubtedly time traveler, the person who was secretly helping him with his scenario, not to mention - his own son. "We detected the possibility of it exploding, so we disposed of it as soon as possible." He stretched the truth to its limit.  
"赤木博士认为它损坏太严重，无法利用，"碇源堂回答道。实际上，从晨曦使徒身上回收的 S2 引擎虽然部分受损，但仍有许多用途。经过一番激烈的思想斗争，他决定听从无疑是时间旅行者的真嗣——那个暗中帮助他实现计划的人，更不用说——他自己的儿子。"我们检测到它有爆炸的可能性，所以尽快处理掉了。"他尽可能地夸大了事实。

"Hm," SEELE 03 pondered, "an S2 engine could be a decisive addition to Evangelion technology. Is it wise to just throw it away? We don't get many such opportunities."  
"嗯，" SEELE 03 沉思道，"S2 引擎对 EVA 技术可能是个决定性的补充。就这么扔掉明智吗？我们可没多少这样的机会。"

"Dr. Akagi had run some simple tests on it. We've recorded all data we got, and we'll share it with other branches." Gendo conceded.  
"赤木博士已经对它进行了一些简单测试。我们记录了所有获得的数据，并将与其他分支共享。" 碇源堂让步道。"

"I see. By the way, good work on sabotaging Jet Alone," SEELE 01 spoke, "we can't let anyone outside disrupt the scenario."  
"我明白了。顺便说一句，破坏 Jet Alone 的工作做得不错，" SEELE 01 说道，"我们不能让外界任何人干扰剧本。"

Gendo chuckled internally at Keel's words, "it was what I must do. Even if their intention wasn't to rival NERV, an actual droid would be no match against the Angels."  
源堂在心里暗笑基尔的话，“这是我必须做的。即便他们的意图并非与 NERV 竞争，一个真正的机器人也无法与使徒匹敌。”

"Correct. It's the AT-Field of the Evangelion that defeats them. Speaking of which," SEELE 05 switched to a questioning tone, "the Third Child exhibited unusual usage of his AT-Field during the sortie against the Sixth Angel. He generated a magnetic field through some unforeseen method. I demand an explanation."  
“没错。是 EVA 的 AT 力场击败了它们。说到这个，” SEELE 05 转换了语气，质疑道，“在与第六使徒的战斗中，第三适格者展现了对 AT 力场的异常运用。他通过某种未预见的方法产生了磁场。我要求一个解释。”

"I am no scientist, and Dr. Akagi is still digging into the recordings. We may never know the truth behind it," Gendo improvised, "perhaps it was just his survival instinct at work."  
“我不是科学家，赤木博士仍在研究录像资料。我们可能永远无法得知真相，”源堂即兴回答，“或许那只是他的求生本能发挥了作用。”

"Hm," SEELE 01's voice carried a hint of suspicion, "you will inform us of any possible disruptions to the scenario as soon as possible, Gendo." He demanded before the monoliths disappeared into the void.  
"嗯，" SEELE 01 的声音带着一丝怀疑，"你会尽快通知我们任何可能扰乱计划的情况，碇。"他在石碑消失于虚空前命令道。

"The old men are certainly getting suspicious," Fuyutsuki put his hand behind his back, "we may have to play safer."  
"那些老头子确实越来越疑心了，" 冬月将手背在身后，"我们可能得更谨慎些。"

"No doubt." Gendo responded halfheartedly. His deal with his son was between the two of them only. Even Kozo had no idea about it, so he couldn't even provide constructive suggestions.  
"毫无疑问。" 碇源堂半心半意地回应。他与儿子的交易仅限于他们两人之间。就连葛城也没有察觉，因此也无法提供建设性的建议。

Only one thought remained in his mind. _'Son…'_  
他的脑海中只剩下一个念头。'儿子…'

"Soryu, could you write down the answer to question two?" Nebukawa Sensei requested after Shinji finished answering question one – a reasonably easy geometric proof problem.  
“惣流，你能写下第二题的答案吗？”在真嗣回答完第一题——一个相当简单的几何证明问题后，Nebukawa 老师问道。

Not so easy for Asuka, who couldn't even comprehend half of the words written on the blackboard. "Yes, teacher," she bit down her lips and headed to the blackboard, writing random equations on it.  
对明日香来说就没那么容易了，她甚至无法理解黑板上写的一半内容。“是的，老师，”她咬了咬嘴唇，走向黑板，在上面随意写下一些方程式。

"Soryu, this is incorrect. Why did you write the Lorentz contraction equation under a trigonometric problem?" Nebukawa Sensei said disbelievingly.  
"惣流，这不对。为什么你把洛伦兹收缩公式写在一个三角函数问题下面？" 碇老师难以置信地说道。

Asuka's mouth became a thin line, "well, they are related, aren't they?" Her pride refused to let her admit her mistake and incompetence, "you need the Pythagorean theorem to derive the equation for-"  
明日香的嘴角紧抿成一条线，"嗯，它们是有联系的，不是吗？" 她的自尊心不允许她承认错误和无能，"你需要用勾股定理来推导这个公式的……"

"Soryu, do you understand what the problem is asking for?" The Sensei cut her off, dreading he wouldn't be able to follow her if she continued.  
"惣流，你明白题目在问什么吗？" 老师打断了她，担心如果她继续说下去，自己会跟不上。

"Yeah, it's about…trigonometry."  
“嗯，是关于……三角函数的。”

Nebukawa Sensei sighed, "listen, the length of side A is 6, and the angle…"  
Nebukawa 老师叹了口气，“听着，边 A 的长度是 6，而角度……”

After the Sensei spoke out the problem, Asuka quickly solved it with skill. She turned back to her seat; her irritation only grew as she saw Shinji was looking at her with an odd expression, his eyes indubitably carried a tinge of amusement.  
老师说完题目后，Asuka 迅速熟练地解了出来。她转身回到座位；看到 Shinji 正用一种奇怪的表情看着她，眼中无疑带着一丝戏谑，她的烦躁感愈发强烈。

_Shinji I.: Having trouble reading kanji?_ Her laptop flashed a massage.  
真嗣一：看不懂汉字吗？她的笔记本电脑闪现了一条信息。

She huffed. _Asuka LS.: No shit sherlock!_  
她哼了一声。明日香·兰格雷：废话少说！

_Shinji I.: I can help you with that.  
真嗣一：我可以帮你。_

_Asuka LS.: I don't need your help!  
明日香 LS.: 我不需要你的帮助！_

_Shinji I.: You don't WANT my help. We're a team, remember? We can help each other.  
真嗣 I.: 你不是不想要我的帮助。我们是团队，记得吗？我们可以互相帮助。_

_Asuka LS.: Oh? Am I looking it right? The invincible Shinji-sama needing help from the poor Asuka?  
明日香 LS.: 哦？我看起来对了吗？无敌的真嗣大人需要可怜的明日香的帮助？_

_Shinji I.: You don't need to be so scornful, Asuka.  
真嗣一：你不必如此轻蔑，明日香。_

_Asuka LS.: Whatever. Speak what you need.  
明日香·L·绫波：随你怎么说。有什么事就直说吧。_

Shinji pondered for a moment. What could he need from her? His German was almost flawless, his grades were always at the top of the class, much to Asuka's annoyance. Still-  
真嗣沉思片刻。他能从她那里需要什么呢？他的德语几乎完美无缺，成绩也总是班级顶尖，这让明日香颇为恼火。不过——

_Shinji I.: I could use a second hand when cooking. This way, I'll have time to make some cakes.  
真嗣一：做饭时有个帮手会好很多。这样我就有时间做些蛋糕了。_

He could practically feel her radiating surprise. _Asuka S.: Deal. You teach me kanji, I'll help you cook. And you MUST make me the cakes I want._  
他几乎能感受到她散发出的惊讶。明日香·S·兰格雷：成交。你教我汉字，我帮你做饭。而且你一定要做我想要的蛋糕。

Shinji smiled. _Shinji I.: Deal._  
真嗣笑了。真嗣一：成交。

Ritsuko took a sip of her coffee as she analyzed the data of the Ramiel fight, as someone snuck up from behind her and wrapped their arms around her, making her gasp. "Still a world-class workaholic, eh Ritsuko?" Kaji asked.  
律子抿了一口咖啡，正分析着拉米尔战斗的数据，突然有人从背后悄悄靠近，双臂环抱住她，让她惊呼出声。“还是一如既往的世界级工作狂啊，律子？”加持问道。

"Ah, Kaji, it's been a long time."  
“啊，加持，好久不见。”

"Yes, it has, and yet you still seem to not have a boyfriend." Kaji said, stroking her face lightly. "Perhaps the men of NERV have simply lost their mind to leave such a rose like yourself untouched and lonely."  
“是啊，很久了，可你似乎还是单身。”加持轻抚她的脸颊，说道，“或许是 NERV 的男人们都失去了理智，竟让如此一朵玫瑰独自绽放，无人问津。”

"Well, Kaji, it's nice to see you haven't changed."  
“哎呀，加持，你还是老样子。”

"Perhaps I could be the one to pluck the rose…"  
"或许我可以成为摘取玫瑰的那个人…"

"He's just an idiot as ever," Misato stormed into the room, carrying a bag of baked cakes in her hand, "I say, you should try some of these cakes Shinji…and Asuka made. So tasty. Even the cake shops can't make something like this." She complimented as she walked to Kaji and Ritsuko's side, handing them the cakes.  
"他还是一如既往的傻瓜，" 美里气冲冲地走进房间，手里提着一袋烤蛋糕，"我说，你应该尝尝这些蛋糕，真嗣…还有明日香做的。太美味了。连蛋糕店都做不出这样的味道。" 她一边称赞一边走到加持和律子身边，递给他们蛋糕。

Kaji grabbed one and took a bite, "hmm…delicious, indeed," his brow furrowed, "Shinji's just full of surprises, isn't he?"  
加持拿起一块咬了一口，"嗯…确实美味，" 他的眉头微皱，"真嗣总是充满惊喜，不是吗？"

"Elaborate," Misato said after she swallowed another cake.  
"详细说说，" 美里咽下又一块蛋糕后说道。

"The things he can do… aren't listed in his file," Kaji massaged his chin, "for instance, he shouldn't know how to speak German at all."  
"他会的那些事……档案里都没提，" 加持揉着下巴，"比如说，他根本不应该会讲德语。"

"What? He could've learned the language by himself," Misato retorted before her own frown crept up her face, "though his German is indeed…disturbingly fluent, almost as good as a native speaker."  
"什么？他可能是自学的啊，" 美里反驳道，随即自己也皱起了眉头，"不过他的德语确实……流利得让人不安，几乎和母语者一样好。"

"See what I mean? Moreover, his file says he's shy and reserved. But the Shinji we know? He, of all people, gets under _Asuka's_ skin. Repeatedly. Easily." Kaji's expression turned serious, "he _pushes_ her to do things. Even I had a hard time to do that, at least in the beginning."  
"明白我的意思了吗？而且，他的档案上写着他害羞且内向。但我们认识的碇真嗣呢？他，偏偏就是那个能轻易惹恼明日香的人。屡试不爽。" 加持的表情变得严肃，"他推动她去做事。即便是我，一开始也很难做到这一点。"

"Are you saying we have an imposter on our hands?" Misato questioned, half to herself.  
"你是说我们手上的这个是冒牌货？" 美里自言自语地问道。"

"No," Ritsuko interjected, "the DNA tests checked out. The brain scans as well. He's the real Shinji."  
"不，" 律子插话道，"DNA 检测和脑部扫描都证实了。他是真正的碇真嗣。"

"Well, I think you guys are just paranoid," Misato half-laughed, "I'd say-" She was cut off by the raspy sound of klaxons that suddenly went off.  
"哎，我觉得你们就是太疑神疑鬼了，" 美里半笑着说，"我得说——" 她被突然响起的刺耳警报声打断了。

"Level–2 battle stations, a Pattern Orange has been detected, Dr. Akagi and Captain Katsuragi, report to Central Dogma at once!"  
"二级战斗准备，检测到橙色模式，赤木博士和葛城上尉，立即前往中央教条报到！"

"You've got to be kidding me… another fucking Angel?" Misato said in exasperation, grimacing.  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧……又他妈一个使徒？" 美里恼火地说，皱起了眉头。

"I guess so, Pattern Orange tends to lead straight to Pattern Blue." Ritsuko deadpanned. "Which means more mess to clean up…"  
"我想是的，橙色模式通常直接导致蓝色模式。" 律子面无表情地说。"这意味着更多的清理工作……"

"What do you mean, I'M NOT BEING DEPLOYED?!" Shinji shouted incredulously.  
"你什么意思，我不能被部署？！" 真嗣难以置信地喊道。

"There's no other way, Unit 01 is still under repairs. The last Angel really did a number on it," Misato frowned slightly, "don't worry, Rei and Asuka will handle it just fine."  
"没有其他办法了，初号机还在修理中。上一个使徒确实把它弄得一团糟，" 美里微微皱眉，"别担心，绫波和明日香会处理得很好的。"

"Damn right!" Asuka clapped her hands together. After the defeat of Ramiel, she was tied with Shinji in terms of Angel kill count, which she was bragging about non-stop. "Ooo, too bad Baka-Shinji is gonna get surpassed!"  
“当然厉害！”明日香双手一拍。在击败雷米尔后，她和真嗣的使徒击杀数持平，这让她不停地炫耀。“哦哦，可惜了，笨蛋真嗣要被超越了！”

Shinji again had a bad feeling of losing control. Israfel was always defeated by he and Asuka's synchronized attack in all of his former lives. The week-long synchronization training was something he was always looking forward to, even though he could already predict Asuka's movements impeccably. It was selfish, but still necessary if he wanted to keep the suspicions at a minimum.  
真嗣再次感到一种失控的预感。在前世中，伊斯拉斐尔总是被他和明日香的同步攻击击败。为期一周的同步训练是他一直期待的，尽管他已能完美预判明日香的动作。这虽自私，但为了将怀疑降到最低，仍是必要的。

Now though, he wasn't even going to sortie.  
但现在，他甚至不打算出击。

It's not that he didn't trust Asuka's piloting and combat skills. But the fact that he'd almost never seen her fight Angels without him by her side was what made him worry. Last time when he wasn't on the battlefield…  
并非他不信任明日香的驾驶和战斗技能。但几乎从未见过她在他不在身边的情况下与使徒战斗，这才是让他担忧的原因。上次他不在战场上……

The Angel destroyed her. 使徒摧毁了她。

Asuka saw the face he was making and misunderstood the real reason behind it. She smirked smugly, "how does it feel? You're gonna lose to a girl?"  
明日香看到了他的表情，误解了背后的真正原因。她得意地笑了笑，"你感觉如何？要输给一个女孩了吗？"

"Asuka…" he started. "明日香…" 他开口道。

"What?" "什么？"

"Be careful." "小心点。"

Asuka blinked in surprise. "Hmph, I'll be as careful as I deem necessary! I don't need you to worry!" She sounded less disdainful than she intended it to be. There was something in his voice…and his concerning, if not nervous looks…  
明日香惊讶地眨了眨眼。"哼，我会小心到我认为必要的程度！不需要你担心！" 她的语气没有她想表现得那么轻蔑。他的声音里有些东西…还有他那关切，如果不是紧张的表情…

Two large transport aircraft flew in the air, heading for the shoreline, carrying Unit 00 and Unit 02. The pilots waited patiently to deploy while Misato explained their plan.  
两架大型运输机在空中飞行，朝着海岸线前进，搭载着零号机和二号机。飞行员们耐心等待着部署命令，而美里则向他们解释计划。

"Due to the extensive battle with the Sixth Angel, most of Tokyo-3's intercept system is out of commission. As of right now, we're at 24 percent effectiveness. And for the purposes of killing Angels, it may as well be zero." Misato said over the comm. "We're deploying Unit 00 and Unit 02 to intercept and destroy the target before it comes to shore. So, we'll launch you and power you up on the surface, you'll move to intercept and take turns attacking this thing, is that understood?"  
“由于与第六使徒的激烈战斗，东京-3 的大部分拦截系统已经瘫痪。截至目前，我们的有效性仅为 24%。对于消灭使徒而言，这几乎等同于零。”美里通过通讯设备说道，“我们将部署零号机和二号机，以拦截并摧毁目标，阻止其登陆。因此，我们将在地面上启动你们并为其充能，你们将移动至拦截位置并轮流攻击这个目标，明白了吗？”

"Roger." "You got it Misato!"  
“收到。”“明白了，美里！”

"This sucks! I want to fight this Angel solo, so wondergirl can't steal my kill!" Asuka bemoaned. This was a perfect opportunity to claim her triumph over her rival, even though it could be only temporary.  
“这太糟糕了！我想独自对付这个使徒，这样奇迹女孩就不能抢走我的猎物了！” 明日香抱怨道。这是一个完美的机会，可以暂时超越她的对手，哪怕只是暂时的。

"Asuka, it's standard procedure, get over it. Trust me, two on one will be a lot better than one on one." Misato said, eliciting a huff from the redhead. "Evangelion Unit 00… Evangelion Unit 02… LAUNCH!" The Captain ordered. Both Evangelions slid out of the restraint racks on their planes, and fell to Earth from thousands of feet high.  
“明日香，这是标准程序，别纠结了。相信我，二对一总比一对一要好得多。”美里说道，惹得红发少女哼了一声。“零号机……二号机……发射！”舰长下令。两台 EVA 从各自的飞机约束架上滑出，从数万英尺高空坠向地球。

Near the ground, Ayanami activated her retro rockets, deploying them from the shoulder pylons, landing gracefully on the beach and staying crouched, awaiting the power cables.  
接近地面时，绫波启动了她的反推火箭，从肩部挂架上展开，优雅地降落在海滩上并保持蹲姿，等待电源电缆的连接。

Asuka on the other hand did something far more artful, doing several somersaults in the air before throwing the retro rockets on at the last moment, and landing heavily in the sand.  
另一方面，明日香则展现了一番更为巧妙的技艺，她在空中连续翻了几个筋斗，最后一刻才发射了反向火箭，重重地落在沙地上。

Unit 02 wielded a Progressive Glaive, which simply put a giant Progressive Knife on the end of a long metal rod, while Unit 00 was wielding a Pallet Rifle. A large burst of water shot up from the ocean, revealing an odd, humanoid figure that stood taller than the Evangelions. Its arms and legs were shaped like crescents that were platinum in color with a lilac hue in the sunlight.  
二号机手持一把渐进式戟，简单来说就是在长金属杆末端装上了一把巨大的渐进式刀，而零号机则持有一把托盘步枪。海面上突然喷发出一股巨大的水柱，显露出一个比福音战士还要高大的奇异人形生物。它的四肢呈新月形，颜色为铂金色，在阳光下透出紫罗兰色调。

"I've got visuals on the target," Rei reported.  
“我已经捕捉到目标的影像。”绫波报告道。

"Will you just shut up and just cover me? I'll handle this ugly fuck myself!" Asuka smirked and willed her EVA forward.  
"你能不能闭嘴，就掩护我？这个丑陋的混蛋我自己来对付！" 明日香冷笑一声，操控着她的 EVA 向前冲去。

"Providing fire support," Rei said calmly as she began spreading around suppressing fire. Israfel's AT-Field deployed, stopping the bullets. She began focusing her attack on the Core to try and cause some damage while Unit 02 crouched down like a tiger. Asuka gripped the control yokes tightly and pushed them forward.  
"提供火力支援，" 绫波平静地说道，开始四处散布压制火力。伊斯拉菲尔的 AT 力场展开，挡住了子弹。她开始集中攻击核心，试图造成一些伤害，而 02 号机则像一只猛虎般蹲伏下来。明日香紧紧握住控制杆，猛地向前推去。

"CHARGE!" "冲锋！"

Unit 02 leaped into the air, destroying several buildings along the way. The crimson EVA Unit brought down the Prog Glaive towards Israfel in a vicious swing. "YAAAAHHHHH!" Asuka shouted a battle cry as the Prog Glaive sliced Israfel right down the middle, revealing its fleshy pink interior.  
02 号机一跃而起，沿途摧毁了数座建筑。赤红的 EVA 单位挥舞着 Prog 战斧，猛烈地劈向伊斯拉斐尔。“呀啊啊啊啊！”明日香发出战斗的呐喊，Prog 战斧将伊斯拉斐尔从中劈开，露出了其粉红色的肉质内部。

"Nice work Asuka!" Misato exclaimed happily, feeling proud of the girl.  
“干得漂亮，明日香！”美里兴奋地赞叹道，为这个女孩感到骄傲。

"I told you I was the best, Misato!" Asuka boasted, "hm, does this mean now I'm officially having more kills than the invincible-" She trailed off as she saw the stunning sight in front of her. The Angel started to reform into two copies of its original self, their Cores moved to where the sternum is on the human body, and they shrunk in size, now roughly the height of an Evangelion. One was colored gold, while the other was silver, and they were poised to attack Unit 02.  
“我早就说过我是最棒的，美里！”明日香自夸道，“哼，这是不是意味着我现在正式比那个无敌的——”她话音未落，眼前惊人的一幕让她愣住了。天使开始分裂成两个原版的自己，核心移动到了人类胸骨的位置，体型缩小，现在大约与 EVA 相当。一个呈金色，另一个呈银色，它们准备向 02 号机发起攻击。

"Asuka look out!" Misato's voice echoed through her cockpit, "It's not dead!"  
"明日香，小心！" 美里在她的驾驶舱中回响，"它还没死！"

The gold one moved towards Unit 02, but it was intercepted by a hail of bullets, and no AT-Field stopped it. Unit 02 moved back and brought its weapon to bear, swinging at the silver one as it moved forward and sliced its shoulder clean through. Moments later, it healed itself and pressed forward. Unit 00's hail of gunfire on the gold one has left several holes in it, but it too also reformed. They both then moved towards poor Unit 02. "Asuka!" Misato shouted, "AIM FOR THE CORE!"  
金色机体向 02 号机移动，但被一阵弹雨拦截，没有任何 AT 力场能阻挡它。02 号机后退并举起武器，向逼近的银色机体挥去，将其肩膀干净利落地切断。片刻后，银色机体自我修复并继续前进。00 号机对金色机体的枪林弹雨留下了几个孔洞，但它也重新组合。两者随后都向可怜的 02 号机逼近。"明日香！"美里大喊，"瞄准核心！"

"Got it!" Asuka replied as she swung the Prog Glaive at the gold one, and cut its Core deeply, causing it to shoot out blood. "Got him!" The silver one's Core glowed and then the gold one's healed. "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!" Asuka screamed. "HOW IS THIS FAIR!"  
"明白！" 明日香回应，挥动 Prog Glaive 砍向金色机体的核心，深及内部，使其喷出血液。"搞定他了！"银色机体的核心发光，随后金色机体的伤口愈合了。"这他妈的怎么回事！"明日香尖叫。"这怎么公平！"

"Asuka, you hit the Core, right?"  
"明日香，你击中了核心，对吧？"

"Yeah, I did, it bled and everything!"  
"是的，我做到了，它还流血了呢！"

Misato frowned, then her face lit up as an idea struck her, "Try break two cores at the same time!"  
美里皱了皱眉，随即脸上闪过一丝灵光，""试试同时击破两个核心！"

"Roger!" "Roger." "罗杰！" "收到。"

Unit 02 waited for Unit 00 to lay suppressive fire on target Alpha; when it did, Asuka piloted her EVA dashing to target Beta, wielding the prog glaive, trying to break its Core at the moment Unit 00's gunfire hit target Alpha. Her plan should be unblemished – under normal circumstances, which didn't include Angel fights. Two halves of Israfel moved in unison; the silver half grabbed Unit 02's arms while the gold one took its legs, tossing the gigantic humanoid in the air as If it was a toy.  
初号机等待零号机对阿尔法目标进行压制射击；当零号机开火时，明日香驾驶着她的 EVA 冲向贝塔目标，挥舞着长柄战斧，试图在零号机火力击中阿尔法目标的瞬间破坏其核心。她的计划本应完美无缺——在非使徒战斗的正常情况下。然而，伊斯拉斐尔的两个部分同步行动；银色部分抓住了二号机的双臂，金色部分则抓住了它的双腿，像抛玩具一样将这个巨大的人形机体抛向空中。

"Ahh! Let go of me, you fucks!" Asuka cried, trying to get her EVA back in control, and failed miserably as the Israfel pair threw her over the hill. The crimson EVA crashed head down into the side of a mountain and ceased operating.  
"啊！放开我，你们这些混蛋！" 明日香喊道，试图重新控制她的 EVA，但失败得一塌糊涂，因为伊斯拉斐尔双双将她抛过了山丘。赤红的 EVA 头朝下撞上山腰，停止了运作。

"Unit 00, engaging the targets," Rei said calmly as she threw the pallet rifle away and picked up her prog knife, only that the small knife was far from enough to defeat the Angel. Unit 00 charged the gold Angel and stabbed it through the Core, making it bleed. She then threw that Angel aside and then sunk the Prog Knife into the silver one's Core. Ayanami moved away from both Angels and saw them standing back up, apparently healed and coming at her again. They both landed a synchronized punch to Unit 00's abdomen, momentarily stunning Ayanami with the tremendous force of the hit. Utilizing her moment of immobile state, the Angels lifted her up and threw her in a similar fashion to Unit 02, making the blue EVA Unit slamming into the sea.  
「零号机，接触目标。」绫波平静地说道，她扔掉了手中的弹射步枪，拾起高频振动刀，然而这把小刀远不足以击败使徒。零号机冲向金色使徒，一刀刺穿其核心，使其流血。随后，她将那使徒甩到一旁，又将高频振动刀插入银色使徒的核心。绫波远离了两名使徒，只见它们重新站起，显然已经痊愈，再次向她袭来。它们同时击中零号机的腹部，巨大的冲击力让绫波短暂失神。趁她无法动弹之际，使徒将她举起，如同对待二号机一般，将蓝色 EVA 机体猛地抛入海中。

The darkened room was faintly lit up as the projector came to life. Asuka had her head tilted down, looking at the floor as the slideshow started. Rei stood beside her in an utterly unimpressed manner. Shinji was there as well, a blank expression on his face. They felt they needn't be reminded about the catastrophe that was their most recent mission.  
昏暗的房间随着投影仪的启动而微微亮起。明日香低着头，目光落在地板上，幻灯片开始播放。绫波站在她身旁，一脸漠然。真嗣也在场，面无表情。他们觉得无需再被提醒最近那场灾难性的任务。

"At 10:58 AM, Unit 00 was attacked by both of the targets, Alpha and Beta which had separated from the original target…"  
上午 10 点 58 分，零号机遭到原目标分离出的阿尔法和贝塔两个目标的攻击……

Asuka sighed. Averting her eyes from the slideshow wasn't going to keep her from being forced to relive the most disastrous sortie in the history of the Evangelion Project. It especially didn't help for Asuka to have Kaji sitting right behind her. As the presenter continued, the Second Child started murmuring to herself about the reason for the mission being such a catastrophic failure. "It's all wondergirl's fault." Asuka growled, looking up at the screen to see pictures of her and Rei's respective EVAs sticking feet up while the rest of their bodies were either buried under dirt in Asuka's case, or submerged underwater in Rei's.  
明日香叹了口气。避开幻灯片并不能让她免于重温《福音战士计划》历史上最灾难性的出击。特别是当加持就坐在她身后时，这尤其无济于事。随着讲解者继续，第二适格者开始喃喃自语，思考任务为何会如此灾难性地失败。“都是那个奇迹女孩的错。”明日香咆哮着，抬头看向屏幕，看到她和绫波的 EVA 分别翘着脚，身体部分在明日香的情况下被埋在土里，而在绫波的情况下则沉入水下。

As the presenter continued on, Auka felt her fists begin to clench. This was so embarrassing. This was not how her perfect opportunity to beat Shinji was supposed to be. She was supposed to win with glory and elegance, not disaster and failure. "This is all your fault!" She exclaimed, shooting out of her chair, pointing an accusatory finger at her partner.  
随着讲解者继续，明日香感到自己的拳头开始紧握。这太尴尬了。这并不是她击败真嗣的完美机会应有的样子。她本应光荣而优雅地获胜，而不是以灾难和失败告终。“这都是你的错！”她大喊着，从椅子上跳起来，用指责的手指向她的搭档。

Rei Ayanami completely ignored her complaints, which fueled her anger even more.  
绫波零完全无视了她的抱怨，这让她更加愤怒。

She started missing Shinji as her partner, both in and outside of combat.  
她开始怀念真嗣作为她的搭档，无论是在战斗中还是战斗外。

"Enough!" Vice Commander Fuyutsuki roared. "We were lucky that the UN was able to at least send the Angel into retreat, but heed my words, it will be back." Fuyutsuki was not the type of person to get angry. If anything, he had a much calmer demeanor than even Commander Ikari. To see him like this was quite unsettling. "When it does come back, you both will work as a team, and you will destroy it." He glared at both of them, especially at Asuka, because even he knew that she was the root of why the mission was a failure. "Is that understood?"  
“够了！”副司令冬月吼道，“我们很幸运，联合国至少能让使徒撤退，但听我说，它还会回来的。”冬月并不是那种容易发怒的人。相反，他的举止比司令碇源堂还要冷静。看到他这样，实在令人不安。“当它再次回来时，你们两个要作为一个团队，消灭它。”他瞪着他们俩，尤其是明日香，因为他知道她才是任务失败的根本原因。“明白了吗？”

"Yes sir." They replied together.  
“是的，长官。”他们齐声回答。

"Good." He sat back down in his chair. "You two are dismissed. Captain Katsuragi will give you further instruction from here."  
“很好。”他重新坐回椅子上，“你们两个可以离开了。葛城司令会从这里给你们进一步指示。”

Asuka sighed in relief once the Vice Commander's burning glare was off of them. It felt like he had just drained all their energy away by doing so little as looking at them. All three pilots slowly trudged out of the room, leaving the adults to discuss this further. As the door closed shut behind them, Asuka leaned her arm against the wall and rested her head on her forearm. "Mein Gott, that was awful."  
当副司令那灼热的目光从他们身上移开后，明日香松了一口气。感觉他仅仅是用目光就抽走了他们所有的精力。三位驾驶员缓缓走出房间，留下大人们继续讨论。当门在他们身后关上时，明日香靠在墙上，将头枕在手臂上。“我的天，真是糟糕透顶。”

"So it looks like you're working with Ayanami, huh?" Shinji said nonchalantly, still worried about the incoming synchronization training. He knew Rei would have no problem being paired with her, but not so much in Asuka's case. If their training routine took a hit, Asuka would complain, and Rei would most likely ignore her, which would irritate her even more. He needed to be highly discreet if he wanted to prevent the vicious cycle.  
“看来你和绫波一起工作了，是吧？” 真嗣随意地说道，心中仍担忧着即将到来的同步训练。他知道绫波与她搭档不会有问题，但换成明日香就不一定了。如果训练效果受到影响，明日香会抱怨，而绫波多半会无视她，这只会让她更加恼火。如果他想避免这种恶性循环，就必须非常谨慎。

"Hmph, she's not half a pilot as you are," Asuka blurted out, "that doesn't mean you're anywhere near me, got that?" She hastily added.  
“哼，她连你一半的飞行员水平都没有，” 明日香脱口而出，“这并不意味着你能接近我，明白吗？” 她急忙补充道。

Shinji chuckled but made no further comments. Within the lifelong time he'd known her, he had quickly come to learn that her pride was her strongest character trait. He knew this was a massive blow to her ego, and he felt terrible about it. However, he was also aware that she may have needed a good punch to the pride if it made her a better teammate because of it.  
真嗣轻笑一声，但没有进一步评论。在他认识她的漫长岁月里，他很快了解到她的骄傲是她最鲜明的性格特点。他知道这对她的自尊心是个巨大打击，他为此感到难过。然而，他也意识到，如果这能让她成为更好的队友，那么或许她需要这样的打击来磨砺自己的骄傲。

AN: Hm, I love short and quick updates. It's also good for setting up cliffhangers. I have to say though, I've already got the entire plotline planned, including the ending. Next chapter – sync training, character development. Stay tuned and leave a review!  
作者笔记：嗯，我喜欢简短而迅速的更新，也适合设置悬念。不过得说，整个剧情走向，包括结局，我已全盘规划好了。下一章——同步训练，角色成长。敬请期待并留下您的评论！

## *Chapter 8*: Chapter 8: Juxtaposition  
*第八章*: 第八章：并置

**Chapter 8: Juxtaposition 第八章：并置**

Shinji stared at the unprecedented _dazzling_ sight in front of him, summoning all of his willpower just to hold back a round of laughter, but still failed miserably. Asuka and Rei both wore the ludicrous 'sync outfit', a clashing ensemble of black spandex shorts and a loose-fitting top that threatened to fall off the shoulders.  
真嗣盯着眼前前所未有的耀眼景象，竭尽全力才勉强忍住一阵大笑，但最终还是失败了。明日香和绫波都穿着那套荒谬的'同步装'，黑色紧身短裤搭配一件松垮的上衣，肩膀处似乎随时都会滑落。

It wasn't the outfit themselves that broke his composure – it was the fact that Asuka wore the blue one, while Rei wore the pink one, the colors of their clothes contrasted by the colors of their hair and eyes, creating an unmatched ridiculous and comical scene.  
并非衣服本身让他失去了镇定——而是因为明日香穿的是蓝色那件，而绫波穿的是粉色那件，衣服的颜色与她们的发色和眼睛形成鲜明对比，构成了一幅荒谬又滑稽的画面。

"What are you laughing at?!" Asuka barked at Shinji, her face blushed a deep red which added more contrast to the sight, "urgh, I don't even know why we're wearing this stupid thing! This is child abuse!"  
“你在笑什么？！”明日香对真嗣吼道，她的脸涨得通红，为这景象增添了更多对比，“呃，我甚至不知道我们为什么要穿这种蠢东西！这是虐待儿童！”

"Calm down, Asuka, you look pretty good in this," Shinji remarked casually after his laughter died down. Even though her personality was downright annoying, he still had to admit that Asuka's feminine figure was unrivaled.  
“冷静点，明日香，你穿这个挺好看的，”真嗣在笑声平息后随意地说道。尽管她的性格确实令人讨厌，但他不得不承认明日香的身材无可挑剔。

"Huh? Pervert! I knew it!" Asuka huffed, and her blush deepened. However, she actually felt a sense of relief that Shinji, who she thought was gay, finally acknowledged her beauty. It's not that she needed his confirmation to know she was pretty – the constant leering gazes she got at school, the extremely annoying amount of love letters, and the numerous date requests she received objectively proved it.  
“啊？变态！我就知道！”明日香哼了一声，脸颊上的红晕更深了。然而，她内心其实感到一丝宽慰，因为被她误以为同性恋的真嗣终于承认了她的美貌。并非她需要他的认可来证明自己的魅力——学校里那些令人厌烦的痴迷目光、堆积如山的情书，以及络绎不绝的约会邀请，都客观地证明了这一点。

Still, all the attention she gained at school never made her feel like this. She didn't know why, but Shinji's recognition just made a difference.  
尽管如此，学校里所有的关注从未让她有过这样的感觉。她不知道为什么，但真嗣的认可就是有所不同。

Asuka smirked before her eyes settled on her training partner standing beside her. Her smirk quickly turned into a slight frown. The First Child didn't look half bad as her in the outfit that perfectly outlined her body. It annoyed her even more when she saw Shinji seemed to turn his attention away from her to Rei. However, her assumption that Shinji was more attracted to Rei couldn't have been farther from the truth.  
明日香微微一笑，目光落在了站在她身边的训练搭档身上。她的笑容很快变成了轻微的皱眉。这位第一适格者穿着紧贴身形的服装，看起来并不逊色于她。更让她恼火的是，她注意到真嗣似乎将注意力从她身上转移到了绫波身上。然而，她认为真嗣对绫波更有吸引力的想法，实际上大错特错。

"Alright, listen you two," Captain Katsuragi came into the room, "the two halves of the Angel move in unison, so we suppose we need to attack them with two perfectly in-sync EVA as well." Seeing the pilots nodded, she continued in a cheerier voice, "so… we're going to defeat the Angel with music and dance!" She proudly held up a flash drive and dangled it in front of them.  
"好了，你们两个听我说，" 葛城美里队长走进房间，"这个使徒的两部分是同步行动的，所以我们认为我们也需要用两台完全同步的 EVA 来攻击它们。" 看到驾驶员们点头，她用更欢快的声音继续说，"所以……我们要用音乐和舞蹈来击败使徒！" 她自豪地举起一个闪存盘，在他们面前晃了晃。

"Gott…I should've seen this coming, from this ridiculous outfit!" She tugged the collar of her outfit, "seriously though, which genius thought this is a good idea?!"  
"天哪……我早该料到会是这样，从这荒谬的服装就能看出来！" 她拉了拉衣领，"说真的，到底是哪个天才认为这是个好主意？！"

"The genius' called Kaji, Asuka," Shinji chuckled in amusement.  
"天才少女叫加持，明日香，" 真嗣轻笑出声。

"Ka-" Asuka choked, "argh, forget it! What exactly do we need to do, Misato?"  
"加——" 明日香哽住，"啊，算了！我们到底需要做什么，美里？"

"Simple," Misato smiled, "like I said, you'll time your movements with this music." She held up the flash device once again. "As for the dance, you're going to play DDR. That's what the machine there is for." She pointed at the dance machine in the living room.  
"简单，" 美里微笑道，"就像我说的，你们要配合这段音乐来移动。" 她再次举起闪存盘。"至于舞蹈，你们要玩 DDR。那台机器就是用来跳舞的。" 她指向客厅里的跳舞机。

"Wonderful…" Asuka mumbled in exasperation, "just fucking wonderful…"  
“太棒了……”明日香恼怒地咕哝着，“真是他妈的棒极了……”

The following day, Misato woke up the pilots at precisely 6 am. It was supposed to be the first day of their actual dancing session. After a whole afternoon of familiarization with the music and the dance routine, Asuka and Rei got a decent memory of them.  
次日清晨，美里在 6 点整准时叫醒了驾驶员们。这本应是他们实际舞蹈训练的第一天。经过整个下午对音乐和舞蹈动作的熟悉，明日香和绫波已经大致记住了。

"...and that's how you get sync scores. Remember, both of you need to get 100 percent to have a chance to defeat the Angel. Now let's try this. Asuka, go to the left mat. Rei, you'll have the right one. Okay. Both of you, put on your headset. Okay. Ready? Three, two, one!"  
"...这就是如何获得同步率的方法。记住，你们俩都需要达到 100%才有机会击败使徒。现在我们试试这个。明日香，去左边的垫子。绫波，你用右边的。好了。你们俩，戴上耳机。好了。准备好了吗？三，二，一！"

The rhythm was too familiar to Shinji, however the scene was at least disorientating. Rei and Asuka moved in sync, not much away from he and Asuka's best synchroneity. He felt confused, as Asuka and Misato, at first; there's something wrong about it, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.  
节奏对真嗣来说太过熟悉，然而场景至少让他感到迷惑。绫波和明日香同步移动，与他和明日香的最佳同步度相差无几。他感到困惑，和起初的明日香与美里一样；总觉得有些不对劲，但他又说不上来具体是什么。

Misato watched the scene in utter disbelief as well. She'd never thought two persons with such antithetical personalities could work together so well.  
美里也难以置信地看着这一幕。她从未想过两个性格如此迥异的人能合作得这么好。

Shinji continued to stare at the unbelievable sight in front of him.  
真嗣继续盯着眼前这不可思议的景象。

Then Asuka made a misstep.  
随后，明日香犯了一个错误。

Rei did as well. 丽也做得很好。

The pilots temporarily ignored the minor deviance and continued dancing, but it didn't go unnoticed by Shinji, who was looking at them intently. Then, he thought of his first time syncing with Rei – they nailed it in one try as well.  
驾驶员们暂时忽略了这一细微偏差，继续跳舞，但这一幕并未逃过真嗣的眼睛，他正专注地观察着他们。随后，他想起了自己第一次与丽同步时的情景——他们也是一次就成功了。

His brain slowly started connecting the dots. When he was trying to sync with Asuka, it was always more of _him_ predicting _her_ movements, not the other way around. But Rei… she's not _predicting_ Asuka's movements. She was _mimicking_ them.  
他的大脑开始慢慢将这些线索串联起来。当他试图与明日香同步时，总是他在预测她的动作，而非反过来。但丽……她并没有在预测明日香的动作。她是在模仿她们。

Shinji watched them dancing for longer, paying close attention to Rei's behaviors. He soon found out that even though the two danced almost in perfect sync, Rei's movements were nearly always a split second later than Asuka's. Not the kind of delays the dance machine would recognize.  
真嗣继续观察着他们的舞蹈，特别留意了绫波的行为。他很快发现，尽管两人几乎完美同步，但绫波的动作总是比明日香慢上那么一瞬间。这不是舞蹈机器能识别的那种延迟。

Now it all made sense to him. Rei, being a half Angel, must've possessed inhuman perceptiveness and reflex. She _saw_ Asuka's movements and _replicated_ them. Just like how she did with him.  
现在这一切对他来说都解释得通了。作为半个使徒，绫波必定拥有超乎常人的感知力和反应速度。她观察明日香的动作并加以模仿，就像她对他所做的那样。

After the final beat of the music sounded, the scoreboard showed a 95 percent sync score. Asuka stared at Rei in utter disbelieve, while the blue-haired girl stood there indifferently. The silence lasted about ten seconds before Misato finally spoke up, "Well, that was...quite impressive. Keep up the work. I don't think you guys will need much effort to accomplish our goal, considering this is your first time doing it."  
随着音乐最后一个节拍响起，计分板上显示出了 95%的同步率。明日香难以置信地盯着绫波，而蓝发女孩则漠然地站在那里。沉默持续了大约十秒钟，直到美里终于开口，“嗯，这真是……相当令人印象深刻。继续努力。考虑到这是你们第一次尝试，我想你们达成目标不会费太多力气。”

"Look wondergirl! We just aced it!" Asuka exclaimed in joy; her grin quickly faded and turned into a frown after Rei completely ignored her enthusiasm and continued standing on the dance mat in silence.  
"看啊，奇迹女孩！我们刚刚完美过关了！" 明日香兴奋地喊道；她的笑容很快消失，转而皱起了眉头，因为绫波完全无视了她的热情，继续默默地站在跳舞垫上。

It reminded her of the doll.  
这让她想起了那个玩偶。

"Wondergirl?" Asuka probed. "Ayanami?" She added after getting no reaction whatsoever.  
"奇迹女孩？" 明日香试探性地问道。"绫波？" 她补充道，因为完全没有得到任何反应。

"Yes, Pilot Soryu?" Rei finally responded, fixing her gaze with the redhead.  
“是的，碇司令？”绫波终于回应道，目光与红发少女交汇。

"Gott…I swear to God if that was intentional-"  
“该死……我发誓，如果那是故意的——”

"Asuka!" Shinji interjected absentmindedly, "it's just who Ayanami is, so please-" the words came out without his brain processing it.  
“明日香！”真嗣不经意间插话道，“绫波就是这样的人，所以请——”这些话未经大脑便脱口而出。

"Oh, I see what this is," Asuka cut him off; Shinji's heart sunk as he saw how _hurt_ she looked. She turned to Shinji, "I thought we were a team…and now you're defending her! I'm done with this!" She snarled angrily and stormed out of the apartment, slamming the shut so hard that it bounced back partly opened.  
"哦，我明白了这是怎么回事，" 明日香打断了他；真嗣的心沉了下去，因为他看到她看起来多么受伤。她转向真嗣，"我以为我们是团队……现在你却在为她辩护！我受够了！" 她愤怒地咆哮着，冲出了公寓，用力甩门，以至于门反弹回来，半开着。

Shinji silently cursed at his carelessness, "I'll go after her!" He said to Rei and Misato before rushing to the door and slid his shoes on, running out as well.  
真嗣默默地咒骂自己的粗心，"我去追她！" 他对绫波和美里说，然后冲向门口，穿上鞋子，也跑了出去。

The convenience store was the place Shinji firstly went to; just like he expected, Asuka was crouched in front of the refrigerator case. He walked to her side and crouched down next to her. "Asuka…" he started.  
便利店是真嗣首先去的地方；正如他所料，明日香正蹲在冰箱前。他走到她身边，蹲下来。"明日香……" 他开口道。

"Go away, Baka-Shinji," said Asuka in a low voice. "I don't want to talk to you right now…"  
"走开，笨蛋真嗣，" 明日香低声说道，"我现在不想和你说话……"

"I'm not going anywhere, Asuka." Shinji said softly, smiling, "we're a team, remember? I'm not going to abandon you."  
"我不会离开的，明日香。" 真嗣轻声说道，微笑着，"我们是团队，记得吗？我不会抛弃你的。"

"Is that all I am to you?" Asuka suddenly asked.  
"对你来说我就只是这样吗？" 明日香突然问道。

"What do you mean, Asuka?" Shinji raised his eyebrows.  
"你是什么意思，明日香？" 真嗣扬起眉毛。

"What I mean is why didn't you say 'friend'?!" Asuka said in her hurt voice. "You're friends with wondergirl, but not me!"  
"我的意思是，你为什么不说是‘朋友’？！" 明日香用受伤的语气说道，"你和那个奇迹女孩是朋友，却不是和我！"

"Asuka, haven't you ever thought that you might be the reason? Rei I don't think can even be unkind, just extremely truthful with her opinions. You're not exactly easy to talk to. One minute you're yelling, and the next you're calm and sweet, it's hard to get a read on someone when their mood changes at the drop of a hat."  
"明日香，你有没有想过可能问题出在你自己身上？丽我觉得她根本就不会对人刻薄，只是非常坦率地表达自己的看法。你可不是那么好沟通的。一会儿大喊大叫，一会儿又冷静甜美，一个人的情绪变化如此之快，很难真正了解他们。"

"So, you can make an effort!" Asuka retorted.  
"所以，你可以努力一下！" 明日香反驳道。

"So could you, Asuka." Shinji shot back calmly.  
"你也可以，明日香。" 真嗣平静地回击。

"Just leave me alone, Shinji!" Asuka shouted as she ran out.  
"别管我，真嗣！" 明日香喊着跑开了。

"Asuka, wait!" Shinji shouted as she ran down the street. Shinji went up to the counter. "Can you put this on my account please, and hurry."  
"明日香，等等！" 真嗣在她身后喊道，她正沿着街道奔跑。真嗣走到柜台前，"请把这个记在我的账上，麻烦快点。"

"Sure thing, kid." The cashier said. Shinji took the bags of food and ran after Asuka, who was already a few blocks ahead of him, and clearly sad because she was standing still and looked as though she was crying. Shinji rushed as quickly as possible to see if he could fix what made her run out this time.  
"当然可以，孩子。" 收银员说道。真嗣接过食物袋，追向已经跑出几个街区的明日香，她显然很伤心，因为她站在那里一动不动，看起来像是在哭泣。真嗣尽可能快地跑过去，想看看这次能不能解决让她跑出来的问题。

"Asuka!" Shinji shouted. "明日香！" 真嗣喊道。

"What do you want?!" Asuka said, glaring at him. _'He didn't leave me...'_"Why did you follow me?!"  
"你想干什么？！" 明日香瞪着他，说道，'他没有离开我...' "你为什么要跟着我？！"

"I'm sorry!" "对不起！"

"Why are you apologizing?!" Asuka shouted at him. "Because you're not my friend, or because this makes you feel better?!"  
"你为什么要道歉？！" 明日香对他大喊。"是因为我不是你的朋友，还是因为这让你感觉好些？！"

"I'm sorry because I didn't mean to upset you with what I said!" Shinji said empathically. "I was only telling the truth! You ran out before I could say that I want to be your friend, Asuka, you just don't make it easy!"  
"对不起，因为我无意中用我说的话让你难过！" 真嗣充满同情地说。"我只是在说真话！你跑出去之前我还没来得及说我想成为你的朋友，明日香，只是你不容易让人接近！"

"Yeah, sure, you say that now…" Asuka huffed.  
“是啊，当然，你现在这么说……”明日香哼了一声。

"Asuka, stop it," Shinji sighed, "I know you're mad at me about something, and I don't really care what, I'm just trying to help, but if you don't want it, then so be it." Shinji turned and walked away. "See you around, Asuka…"  
“明日香，别这样，”真嗣叹了口气，“我知道你对我有什么不满，我也不在乎是什么，我只是想帮忙，但如果你不想要，那就这样吧。”真嗣转身走开。“回头见，明日香……”

"Shinji, wait!" Asuka ran and grabbed his shoulder. "I… uh…I… I know I'm being unreasonable...but I...I'd rather do this with you, not with that...emotionless doll! _We_'re the team, not her!"  
“真嗣，等等！”明日香跑过去抓住他的肩膀。“我……呃……我……我知道我太无理取闹了……但我……我宁愿和你一起做这件事，而不是和那个……没有感情的玩偶！我们是团队，不是她！”

"You could say the same for me, Asuka," Shinji said gently, "but we don't exactly have a choice, do we? You _need_ to work together to beat this Angel. You don't have to like her, but at least make it a working relationship?"  
"你也可以这么说我自己，明日香，" 真嗣温和地说，"但我们确实没有选择，不是吗？你需要一起合作来击败这个使徒。你不必喜欢她，但至少让它成为一个工作关系？"

"Fine!" Asuka huffed in exasperation, "but only because I get to defeat the Angel!"  
"好吧！" 明日香恼怒地哼了一声，"但只是因为我能击败那个使徒！"

"Asuka, there's life outside of EVA and Angels, wouldn't you say?" Shinji smiled, putting his hand over hers, "you don't need to rely on it for anything. Piloting EVA to defeat the Angels, I mean. I piloted the EVA because I had no other purpose in life, and it gave me recognition from people, so I know I exist. But now I pilot for a different reason. I met people through EVA, you, Misato, Ayanami, my friends at school…and now I pilot the EVA to protect the people I care about." He paused for a second, locking his gaze with the redhead, "even if you don't want to be my…friend, we're still a team."  
"明日香，EVA 和使徒之外还有生活，你不觉得吗？" 真嗣微笑着，把手放在她的手上，"你不需要依赖它来做任何事。驾驶 EVA 击败使徒，我的意思是。我驾驶 EVA 是因为我在生活中没有其他目的，它让我得到了人们的认可，所以我知道我存在。但现在我驾驶 EVA 有不同的理由。通过 EVA 我遇到了一些人，你，美里，绫波，我在学校的同学们……现在我驾驶 EVA 是为了保护我在乎的人。" 他停顿了一下，与红发少女的目光紧紧相锁，"即使你不想成为我的……朋友，我们仍然是一个团队。"

Asuka's heart fluttered hearing his words. Compared to Shinji, she piloted the EVA for more selfish reasons. Maybe she could change, just like how he did? _'Why does he make a difference? I've never felt like this before!'_ "Who said I don't?" She smirked.  
"听到他的话，明日香的心跳加速了。与真嗣相比，她驾驶 EVA 更多是出于自私的理由。也许她也能像他那样改变？'为什么他会让我感觉不同？我以前从未有过这种感觉！' “谁说我不能？”她得意地笑了。”

"I'm glad," Shinji's smile turned into a grin.  
"“我很高兴，”真嗣的微笑变成了咧嘴笑。”

"Now give me my bags, I picked it out, I can carry it myself!" Asuka grabbed the bags from Shinji, who took a bag back. "If we're friends, then we can each carry a bag, Asuka," said Shinji with his warm smile. "You don't have to do everything on your own, right?"  
"“现在把我的包给我，是我挑的，我自己能拿！”明日香从真嗣手中夺过包，真嗣也拿回了一个。“如果我们是朋友，那我们可以各自拿一个包，明日香，”真嗣带着温暖的微笑说。“你不必什么事都自己来，对吧？””

Asuka looked at Shinji and said nothing, but her smile had widened a bit. _'Do I truly need to be alone?'_  
明日香看着真嗣，一言不发，但她的笑容稍稍扩大了些。'我真的需要独自一人吗？'

The rest of their training session went comparatively uneventfully; there wasn't really anything to put the effort in since their synchronization was almost perfect from the very beginning. In fact, Asuka put more effort into not blow up at Rei than practice the dance.  
他们训练的其余部分相对平静无事；由于从一开始他们的同步率就几乎完美，实际上并没有什么需要特别努力的地方。事实上，明日香在避免对绫波发火上投入的精力比练习舞蹈还要多。

The day before the battle quickly came.  
战斗前的那一天很快到来了。

Asuka's icy blue eyes shot open. It was the same dream as before. It was always the same dream. Her sheets were soaked with sweat, and her clothes were drenched. She laid there for a moment, wondering if sleeping by Rei's side was indeed a good idea.  
明日香冰蓝色的眼睛猛地睁开。又是那个梦，和之前一样的梦，总是同样的梦。她的床单被汗水浸透，衣服也湿透了。她躺在那里片刻，思索着睡在丽身边是否真的是个好主意。

Asuka looked down at her shirt and panties, knowing that she'd have to change them since they were so drenched. She leaned up from her bed and grabbed a clean pair of underwear and the sleep shirt she wore the night before out of her dresser. She quickly got a change of clothes, making sure she didn't wake up Rei, and laid back down.  
明日香低头看着自己的衬衫和内裤，知道必须得换掉，因为它们湿透了。她从床上坐起，从抽屉里拿出一套干净的内衣和昨晚穿的睡衣。她迅速换了衣服，确保没有吵醒丽，然后又躺了回去。

But sleep wouldn't come. The blue-haired girl constantly reminded her of the doll…and fueling her nightmare. Even though she had company by her side, the loneliness was chewing her alive.  
但睡意并未降临。蓝发女孩不断让她想起那个玩偶……加剧了她的噩梦。尽管身边有人陪伴，孤独感却如猛兽般吞噬着她。

_'It's always been normal for me to be alone… so being alone shouldn't bother me…'  
“一直以来，独自一人对我来说是常态……所以孤独不应该困扰我……”_

Asuka sighed heavily and got up from her futon again, walking to the closet Shinji was sleeping in. She carefully opened the door and looked inside. The room was so small to the extent she could touch both sides of the wall at the same time. A wave of guilt suddenly surged through her - she was the reason Shinji got shoved in here.  
明日香重重地叹了口气，再次从她的被褥上起身，走向真嗣正在睡觉的壁橱。她小心翼翼地打开门，向里面望去。这个房间小到她可以同时触碰到两边的墙壁。一股愧疚感突然涌上心头——真嗣被塞进这里都是因为她。

Asuka walked to his bed and laid down abruptly, her back facing Shinji's. A sudden gasp could be heard from the said boy.  
明日香走到他的床边，猛地躺下，背对着真嗣。突然，可以听到那个男孩发出了一声惊呼。

"Don't turn around," she hastily said, "Can I just lay here for a while? I… wouldn't mind some company tonight."  
"别转身，" 她急忙说道，"我可以在这里躺一会儿吗？我……今晚不介意有人陪伴。"

Shinji blinked in surprise. Before she would usually give him hits with the 'Wall of Jericho' reference, but now…she became rather direct with her needs. He had no idea of what changed, but he was sure it was a good change.  
真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼。以前她通常会用'耶利哥城墙'的典故来调侃他，但现在……她变得相当直接地表达自己的需求。他不知道是什么改变了，但他确信这是一个好的变化。

"Sure, come to me if you're lonely. Just…don't hog my blanket."  
"当然，如果你感到孤独就过来吧。只是……别霸占我的毯子。"

Asuka felt tightness in her chest. During the month they lived together, although Shinji tended to push her and annoy her, he did nothing but took care of her. What had she done? Nothing but lazing around, leaving all the chores to him unless it's indispensable.  
明日香感到胸口一阵紧缩。在他们同居的那个月里，尽管真嗣总是推搡她、惹她生气，但他所做的无非是照顾她。她又做了什么呢？除了懒散度日，把所有家务都推给他，除非万不得已。

What did she do to earn his warmth and company?  
她究竟做了什么，才换来他的温暖与陪伴？

Nevertheless, she quickly fell asleep with a slight smile on her face.  
尽管如此，她很快便带着一丝微笑沉沉睡去。

"Unit 00, are you ready?" Misato's voice echoed through the First Child's entry plug. "Yes." Rei replied casually. "Unit 02, are you ready?" "You better believe I am!" Asuka's enthusiasm brought a smile to the face of everyone in the control room, save for Fuyutsuki. Last night's sleep was the best she had in a while. Even more so when her nightmare started to resurface, there was a voice there, comforting her, wiping away the bad dream, telling her she didn't need to be alone.  
"“零号机，准备好了吗？”美里少校的声音在第一适格者的插入栓内回响。“是的。”绫波平静地回答。“二号机，准备好了吗？”“你最好相信我准备好了！”明日香的热情让控制室里的每个人都露出了微笑，除了冬月。昨晚是她一段时间以来睡得最好的一次。更让她感到安慰的是，当她的噩梦开始重现时，有一个声音在那里，安慰她，驱散了噩梦，告诉她不必孤单。”

And she knew she had a specific person to thank for.  
"而她知道，有一个人她特别需要感谢。”

"Good." Captain Katsuragi nodded. "Just remember your choreography and everything should be fine."  
“很好。”葛城队长点头道，“只要记住你的动作编排，一切都会顺利的。”

"Oh, by the way." Ritsuko leaned over Misato's shoulder and spoke into the microphone. "You two have increased your average sync scores by five percent. Asuka, you're gonna catch up to Shinji in no time if you keep this up."  
"哦，顺便说一句。" 律子俯身在美里肩上，对着麦克风说道。"你们俩的平均同步率提高了五个百分点。明日香，照这样下去，你很快就会赶上真嗣了。"

"Woo, does this mean I'm going to be the best?" Asuka boasted, although her focus less so on the scores, and more so on the imminent battle. After defeating the Angel, she would surpass the invincible Shinji-sama in every way. The exciting thought made her grew increasingly impatient about the incoming fight.  
"哇哦，这是不是意味着我会成为最棒的？" 明日香自夸道，尽管她的注意力更多地集中在即将到来的战斗上，而不是分数。击败使徒后，她将在各个方面超越无敌的真嗣大人。这个令人兴奋的想法让她对即将到来的战斗越来越不耐烦。

"Captain Katsuragi!" Maya called. "The Seventh Angel is approaching!" "Perfect." She made a sly grin. "EVA Units Launch!"  
"葛城指挥官！" 伊吹呼叫道。"第七使徒正在接近！" "太好了。" 她狡黠地一笑。"EVA 机体，出击！"

As their launch platforms shot out from the cages, Asuka and Rei could hear the music running through their heads. They would be doing this without their umbilical cords, and there was only a 62 second window for them to complete the mission, so they had to act with perfect synchronization and precision. Once the platforms reached the surface, both Unit 00 and 02 shot up into the air, catching a glimpse of the Angel lurking below in the reinforced Tokyo-3. Acting as one, the two EVA pilots reached for the spears in their right shoulder pylon and withdrew them, chucking both downwards onto the Angel, splitting him down the middle, causing Alpha and Beta to take their two separate forms.  
随着发射平台从笼中弹射而出，明日香和绫波能听到脑海中回响的音乐。她们将在此刻脱离脐带电缆，仅有 62 秒的时间完成任务，因此必须以完美的同步与精确行动。平台一到达水面，零号机与二号机便腾空而起，瞥见了藏匿于加固的第三新东京市下的使徒。两位 EVA 驾驶员如一体般同步，伸手从右肩挂架上取下长矛并抽出，将两支矛向下投掷，贯穿使徒，使其一分为二，呈现出阿尔法与贝塔两种形态。

Upon landing, both pilots looked to their sides to see the weapons that had been readied for them. Rei gathered the attention of Alpha with her rifle while Asuka opened fire onto Beta using the canon. Once they had picked agro from them, the two EVA Units discarded their weapons as Alpha and Beta fired lasers at them from their elongated fingers. Each blast came to barely miss their target though, as Unit 00 and 02 made perfect backflips for each shot fired at them as they retreated towards the center of the city.  
着陆后，两位驾驶员各自侧目，看到了为他们准备好的武器。丽用步枪吸引了阿尔法的注意，而明日香则用加农炮向贝塔开火。一旦从它们那里拉到了仇恨，两台 EVA 单位便丢弃了武器，阿尔法和贝塔从它们伸长的手指中发射激光攻击。尽管每次爆炸都险些击中目标，但零号机和二号机每次都以完美的后空翻躲过，撤退至城市中心。

Shinji watched the battle intently; at first, it seemed to be going well, but there's something not right.  
真嗣专注地观看着战斗；起初，一切似乎进展顺利，但总觉得有些不对劲。

Knowing that the battle was coming to a close, the two EVA Units leaped high up into the air and began diving towards the Angel in a corkscrew motion and then flipping forward as Unit 00 extended its right leg out for a kick, while Unit 02 extended its left.  
意识到战斗即将结束，两台 EVA 单位高高跃起，开始以螺旋状俯冲向使徒，随后零号机伸出右腿，二号机伸出左腿，向前翻转进行踢击。

With a vicious impact, both feet landed on the cores.  
随着猛烈的冲击，双脚同时落在了核心上。

But what happened next was unexpected by anyone.  
但接下来发生的事情出乎所有人的意料。

"What the fuck?!" Asuka cried incredulously as both halves of Israfel stood their ground. "We destroyed both cores at the same time, didn't we?!"  
"“搞什么鬼？！”明日香难以置信地喊道，伊斯拉菲尔的两半依然屹立不倒。“我们同时摧毁了两个核心，不是吗？！”

As the fight came to an end, Shinji finally realized the most significant wrinkle in the plan.  
随着战斗接近尾声，真嗣终于意识到了计划中最大的变数。

The difference in Asuka and Rei's sync rates.  
明日香和绫波同步率的不同。

The higher your sync rate was, the lower the latency for your EVA to respond to your commands. While Shinji and Asuka's sync rates were always in the high 70s or 80s when they fought the Angel, Rei and Asuka had a sync rate difference of almost 40 percent, leading to 0.4 seconds of delay, added that Rei had to _watch_ Asuka's movements first, it only amplified the latency between their supposedly simultaneous movements.  
同步率越高，EVA 响应指令的延迟就越低。虽然真嗣和明日香在对抗使徒时同步率通常在 70%到 80%之间，但绫波和明日香的同步率差距近 40%，导致有 0.4 秒的延迟，再加上绫波必须先观察明日香的动作，这使得她们本应同步的动作之间延迟更加明显。

The latency only accumulated throughout the entire battle. Half a second was enough for Israfel to regenerate.  
延迟在整个战斗过程中不断累积。半秒钟的时间已足够伊斯拉斐尔进行再生。

The music ended, leaving everyone dumbfounded, including Rei Ayanami.  
音乐结束，所有人都目瞪口呆，包括绫波零。

Taking advantage of Asuka's moment of distraction, target Alpha and Beta grabbed the crimson EVA Unit, lifting it into the air. However, this time Israfel wasn't going soft on its enemy. "Put me down you-"  
趁明日香分神之际，目标阿尔法和贝塔抓住了绯红的 EVA 初号机，将其举向空中。然而，这一次伊斯拉斐尔并未对敌人手下留情。“把我放下，你这——”

CRACK

"OH MY GOD! HER SPINAL COLUMN HAS JUST BEEN BROKEN!" Maya shouted as she saw the readings, "Unit 02 has gone silent! Pilot status is unknown!"  
"我的天哪！她的脊柱刚刚断裂了！" 玛雅喊道，她看到了读数，"二号机已经沉默！驾驶员状况不明！"

Not any softer for Unit 00 as both halves of Israfel fired their beams in unison at the center of its chest, melting the heavy armor plating in an instant.  
零号机也没有好到哪里去，伊斯拉斐尔的两半同时发射光束，直击其胸口中央，瞬间融化了厚重的装甲板。

"Unit 00 has gone silent as well!" Aoba reported in a shaky voice.  
"零号机也沉默了！" 青叶用颤抖的声音报告道。

Gendo Ikari watched the battle with an almost invisible frown, his hands clasped together tightly.  
碇源堂凝视着战斗，几乎看不见地皱了皱眉，双手紧紧相扣。

Shinji's eyes went wide, sweat dripping down from his forehead, his heart racing. Without instruction, he rushed to the EVA cages.  
真嗣的眼睛瞪得大大的，汗水从额头滴落，心跳加速。未经指示，他便冲向了 EVA 的笼子。

Israfel continued to roar in triumph atop the Geofront, a broken setting sun framed behind it.  
伊斯拉斐尔继续在 GEO 前线顶端咆哮着胜利，破碎的夕阳在其背后映衬。

**Chapter 9: Consequences 第九章：后果**

"Shinji, you're our last hope," Misato said over the comm, her voice strangely calm considering the grim situation. "We, Asuka, Rei, the entire humanity, are all counting on you, I know you can do it."  
“真嗣，你是我们最后的希望，”美里在通讯中说道，她的声音异常平静，考虑到严峻的局势。“我们，明日香，绫波，全人类，都在依靠你，我知道你能做到。”

"I know," Shinji replied, gripping the controls of his EVA so tight that the plastic began to creak. Still, it's easier said than done. Israfel had always required two Evangelions to defeat, but now only Unit 01 was left, not to mention the damage it suffered from Ramiel – its left forearm was missing, and the chest armor was still damaged - hadn't been completely fixed yet.  
“我知道，”真嗣回答道，紧握着 EVA 的操纵杆，以至于塑料开始吱吱作响。尽管如此，说起来容易做起来难。伊斯兰一直以来都需要两台 EVA 才能击败，但现在只剩下初号机了，更不用说它从雷米尔那里受到的伤害——左前臂缺失，胸甲仍然受损——还没有完全修复。

He had no idea of how to fight it, except that he needed to break two cores at the same time.  
他不知道如何与之战斗，只知道他需要同时破坏两个核心。

There's no way to set off another N2 mine to slow down the Angel - they were almost directly above the Geofront, an N2 strike powerful enough to buy the time they needed would also wholly destroy NERV HQ, Tokyo-3 with its residents, as well as the silenced Unit 02 and Unit 00. Still, it was the last reserve.  
无法再引爆另一颗 N2 地雷来延缓使徒的行动——它们几乎直接位于地表之下，一颗足以争取所需时间的强力 N2 打击同样会彻底摧毁 NERV 总部、东京-3 及其居民，以及沉默的二号机和零号机。不过，这是最后的预备手段。

Not that Shinji would still want to have anything to do with this world if it really came to that.  
如果真的到了那一步，真嗣也不会再想与这个世界有任何瓜葛。

"Misato, what's Asuka's status?"  
“美里，明日香的情况如何？”

"Unknow, her entry plug is ejected. We're sending out a retrieval team to crash site," the Captain's words soothed his worries a little. As long as there's still a chance that she's alive, then he still had a reason to fight.  
“不明，她的驾驶舱被弹出。我们正派遣回收队伍前往坠机地点，”舰长的这番话稍稍安抚了他的担忧。只要还有她生还的可能，那么他就有继续战斗的理由。

Still, the Angel hurt Asuka, the girl he loved and promised to protect. He felt anger surge through his body at the thought. Shinji pushed the controls forward, willing his EVA to sprint toward the enemy. Israfel, now returned to its original form, stopped roaring and focused on its newest enemy. Unit 01 reached for its left shoulder pylon and picked up the progressive knife, charging at the Angel.  
尽管如此，天使伤害了 Asuka，他深爱并承诺保护的女孩。想到这里，他感到愤怒在体内涌动。Shinji 向前推动操纵杆，命令他的 EVA 向敌人冲刺。Israfel 恢复了原形，停止咆哮，专注于新的对手。初号机伸手抓住左肩支架，拾起高频刀，向天使发起冲锋。

Israfel blinked in confusion at the seemingly suicidal attack of its opponent, but soon prepared itself for defense. Maybe if he didn't slice it in half, he could find a way to defeat it. Shinji controlled Unit 01 jumped onto a building, trying to lure it away from the girls. His plan worked as the Angel lifted itself up using its AT-Field, leaping toward the purple EVA Unit.  
Israfel 对对手这看似自杀式的攻击感到困惑，但很快做好了防御准备。或许即使不能将其一分为二，他也能找到击败它的方法。Shinji 操控初号机跳上一栋建筑，试图将其引离女孩们。他的计划奏效了，天使利用 AT 力场将自己抬起，向紫色 EVA 单位跃去。

Shinji jumped away from the weaponry building just in time before Israfel crashed onto it, reducing the heavily armored construction into thousands of tons of rubble and debris of steel and concrete. Shinji was surprised to find the Angel seemed to be momentarily stuck in the ruins; utilizing the short period of its immobile state, before the Angel could use its AT-Field to shake off the wreckage, Shinji controlled Unit 01 dashed toward Israfel. Upon entering close-quarters combat distance, he activated his EVA's AT-Field, neutralizing the Angel's, and sank the prog knife into its grey flesh.  
真嗣刚从武器库建筑旁跳开，伊斯拉斐尔就猛地撞了上去，将这座重装甲建筑化为成千上万吨的钢铁和混凝土碎块。真嗣惊讶地发现，天使似乎暂时被困在了废墟中；他利用这短暂的静止状态，在天使能用 AT 力场甩开残骸之前，操控初号机冲向伊斯拉斐尔。进入近战距离后，他激活了 EVA 的 AT 力场，中和了天使的力场，并将高振动粒子刀刺入其灰色的肉体。

The Angel shrieked in pain and raised its horn-like arms, trying to push the purple mecha off. Unit 01 stood its ground however; instead of slicing the Angel that might cause it to split again, Shinji spun and twisted the knife back and forth, digging deeper and deeper into its body, hoping to locate the cores. Fortunately Israfel was weak in physical strength compared to - say, Zeruel – so the thrashing around of the Angel couldn't help it get rid of the purple behemoth.  
天使痛苦地尖叫起来，抬起它那角状的手臂，试图推开紫色的机甲。然而，初号机屹立不倒；真嗣没有选择劈砍天使，以免它再次分裂，而是旋转并扭动刀刃，越刺越深，希望能找到核心。幸运的是，伊斯拉斐尔在体力上比不上——比如说，塞鲁尔——所以天使的挣扎无法帮助它摆脱紫色巨人。

Now the disadvantage of missing a forearm fully revealed itself. Even though Shinji was gaining the upper hand in the fight, he could only inflict regeneratable injuries on the Angel. He wanted to open up the knife wound on Israfel's chest in order to find the cores, so another arm was indispensable.  
现在，失去前臂的劣势完全显现出来了。尽管真嗣在战斗中逐渐占据上风，但他只能对使徒造成可再生的伤害。他想要打开伊斯拉斐尔胸前的刀伤以找到核心，因此另一只手臂是不可或缺的。

Suddenly the Angel stopped struggling; just as Shinji thought it gave up fighting, Israfel split in half by itself.  
突然，使徒停止了挣扎；正当真嗣以为它放弃了战斗时，伊斯拉斐尔自行分裂成了两半。

"Okay that's fucking cheating," Shinji cursed in surprise and vexation.  
“好吧，这他妈的是作弊，”真嗣又惊又恼地咒骂道。

The two halves of Israfel quickly reclaimed the upper hand after a synchronized punch to both of Unit 01's sides. Shinji groaned in pain and jumped back from the twins, knowing how dangerous it was fighting in close quarters against them. To his relief, the two halves merged back into one as soon as Unit 01 hid behind a building - outside of its line of sight.  
伊斯莱尔的两个分身在同步向零号机两侧打出重拳后迅速夺回了优势。真嗣痛苦地呻吟着，从双胞胎面前跳开，深知与他们在近距离战斗有多危险。令他松一口气的是，零号机刚躲到建筑物后，两个分身便立即合二为一——超出了它的视线范围。

The Angel continued marching slowly toward the Geofront after it deemed the threat was neutralized. Finally, it stopped right above the place where Ramiel drilled at, its yin-yang-like eye glowed; a powerful beam shot out, impacting the ground and created a huge crater, raising a cloud of dust and dirt.  
天使在判定威胁被消除后，继续缓慢地向 Geofront 进发。最终，它停在了拉米尔钻探地点的正上方，其阴阳眼般的眼睛闪烁着光芒；一道强大的光束射出，击中地面并形成了一个巨大的弹坑，扬起了一片尘土。

"No you're not doing it!" Shinji shouted and willed his EVA forward, gripping his prog knife tightly. He leaped into the air, pouncing on the Angel. Just as his knife was about to hit the target, the Angel suddenly split in half again; Unit 01 missed its target as it went through the gap between target Alpha and Beta, slamming hard on the ground.  
“不，你不能这么做！”真嗣大喊着，操控他的 EVA 前进，紧紧握住手中的突击刀。他一跃而起，扑向天使。就在刀尖即将命中目标之际，天使突然再次分裂；零号机穿过阿尔法和贝塔之间的空隙，重重地摔在地上，未能击中目标。

Before Shinji could get back on his feet and recompose himself from the mild concussion caused by the heavy impact, the Israfel twins - apparently annoyed by the persistent purple mecha – decided to end it once and for all.  
在真嗣还没能从那次重击造成的轻微脑震荡中恢复过来，重新站稳脚跟之前，伊斯拉斐尔双胞胎——显然是被那台顽固的紫色机体惹恼了——决定一劳永逸地结束这一切。

Both halves of Israfel fired a simultaneous beam at Unit 01's chest, completely destroying its already damaged chest armor. The gold half grabbed the purple EVA's upper torso while the silver one gripped on both of Unit 01's legs, and then they started to pull hard.  
伊斯拉斐尔的两部分同时向初号机的胸部发射了光束，彻底摧毁了它本已受损的胸甲。金色部分抓住了紫色 EVA 的上半身，而银色部分则紧握住初号机的双腿，然后他们开始用力拉扯。

Everyone on the command deck watched in dread as Unit 01's body was stretched to its deformation limit, the sound of metal cracking and moaning under extreme stress echoed through NERV HQ.  
指挥舱内的每个人都惊恐地看着初号机的身体被拉扯到变形的极限，金属在极度压力下发出的断裂和呻吟声在 NERV 总部回荡。

Shinji screamed in agony as he felt his body was about to be torn apart. However he didn't have the ability to divide in half and continue to fight. He would never stand a chance with his current power, all of his professional combat skills notwithstanding; he was already risking a lot just by moving in ways that the designers of the Evangelions didn't dare to think of, breaking several laws of physics in the process. Still, it wasn't enough.  
真嗣痛苦地尖叫着，感觉自己的身体即将被撕裂。然而，他并没有能力一分为二继续战斗。以他目前的实力，即便拥有所有的专业战斗技能，也毫无胜算；他已经在冒险以使徒设计者们不敢想象的方式移动，过程中打破了多条物理定律。即便如此，这还不够。

He needed help…and fast. 他需要帮助……而且要快。

_Mother… 母亲…_

His vision went white.  
他的视野变得一片空白。

XXXXXX

Whenever he actively called for help from his mother, Shinji would always experience a very short – in people outside of Unit 01's eyes - and small-scale instrumentality with the EVA. In fact, he hadn't done this for a while since he had already mastered fighting the Angels without needing her help.  
每当他主动向母亲寻求帮助时，真嗣总会与初号机一同经历一段在旁人看来极为短暂且规模有限的融合现象。实际上，自从他掌握了无需母亲协助就能对抗使徒的战斗技巧后，已经有一段时间没有这样做了。

Things had changed. 情况已经发生了变化。

_Mother? 妈妈？_

_Surprise. Confusion. 惊讶。困惑。_

Shinji looked intently at the white void around him, focusing on his thoughts. Another reason he never liked actively calling for her mother was the fact that he didn't know _whether he should_ know about her mother's whereabouts or not.  
真嗣专注地看着周围的白色虚空，集中思考。他不喜欢主动呼唤她妈妈的原因之一，是他不确定自己是否应该知道她妈妈在哪里。

Fortunately, Shinji already had the answer.  
幸运的是，真嗣已经有了答案。

_Mother…is that really you?  
母亲…真的是你吗？_

_'Shinji?' ‘真嗣？’_

_Mother… it's Shinji. 妈妈… 是真嗣。_

_'Shinji…how… you're really here. My son…how do you know I'm here?'  
'真嗣…怎么…你真的在这里。我的儿子…你怎么知道我在这里？'_

_I…I would never forget that day…when you disappeared from my life.  
我…我永远不会忘记那一天…当你从我的生活中消失。_

He could feel a wave of emotions surge through his body – sadness, surprise, and remorse.  
他可以感受到一波情绪涌遍全身——悲伤、惊讶和悔恨。

_'Shinji…I wondered if you'd ever find me here. I brought you there to see the contact experiment, hoping you could remember me. I'm so happy to see you here…'  
'真嗣……我在想你是否会找到我这里。我带你去看了接触实验，希望你能记起我。看到你在这里，我真的很高兴……'_

Shinji wanted to laugh. When he'd first learned about his mother's whereabouts, he was so happy that his mother was still somehow alive and watching over him all the time. However, after several more cycles, he quickly learned that his mother had her own plans to end the world.  
真嗣想笑。当他最初得知母亲的下落时，他非常高兴，因为母亲仍然以某种方式活着，并一直在关注着他。然而，经过几个循环之后，他很快意识到母亲有自己的计划来结束这个世界。

She willingly became the soul inside Unit 01 for several reasons; aside from wanting her son to be safe when the judgment day came, she also hoped to use the EVA as evidence that humanity existed. For her to do that, the EVA must _truly_ awaken and summon the Lance of Longinus, which usually led to the Third Impact.  
她自愿成为零号机内的灵魂，有多个原因；除了希望在审判日到来时保护儿子的安全外，她还希望利用 EVA 作为人类存在的证据。为此，EVA 必须真正觉醒并召唤朗基努斯之枪，这通常会导致第三次冲击的发生。

He could've accepted her mother's own plan…if she helped him that time…  
如果当时她帮助了他，他本可以接受母亲的计划…

_"Mother! Help me! I need to help Asuka! Please!" Shinji cried desperately at Unit 01 that was frozen in bakelite.  
“妈妈！救我！我得去帮明日香！求你了！”真嗣绝望地对着被封在树脂中的初号机喊道。_

_But it wouldn't move until the scream of Asuka finally died down, who kept believing Shinji, her knight in shining armor, would come and save her, till the last moment of her life.  
但初号机直到明日香的尖叫声最终消逝才有所动作，她一直坚信着，她的骑士，身披闪亮盔甲的真嗣，会在生命的最后一刻前来拯救她。_

He didn't need to expose himself to his mother right now, so Shinji shook the thought off as soon as it surfaced. Still, he couldn't help but feel anger rise. Toward her mother.  
他现在不需要向母亲坦露心迹，所以真嗣一产生这个念头就立刻甩开了。然而，他还是忍不住感到愤怒在升腾。对她的母亲。

_Mother…why did you leave me? Why?!  
妈妈……你为什么要离开我？为什么？！_

_'I'm sorry, Shinji. But I had to do this, or they'll erase me… I'm here to ensure the brighter future I promised you.'  
'对不起，真嗣。但我必须这么做，否则他们会抹去我……我在这里是为了确保我承诺给你的更美好的未来。'_

He could clearly feel the sorrow in his mother's voice. Shinji snorted internally - she'd always say the same thing. It didn't matter whether she really thought of that; he had a more critical task at hand. _Mother…will you help me? To defeat the Angel?_  
他清楚地感受到母亲声音中的悲伤。真嗣内心冷笑——她总是说同样的话。无论她是否真的这么想，这都不重要；他手头有一个更关键的任务。妈妈……你会帮我吗？去打败使徒？

_'Anything for you, my love.'  
'为了你，我的爱，什么都愿意。'_

Shinji barely held back his sneer as he heard the hypocritical words. Nevertheless, he could feel the warmth of LCL around him and almost animalistic power course through his body after he reopened his eyes.  
听到这些虚伪的话语，真嗣几乎忍不住要嗤之以鼻。然而，当他再次睁开眼睛时，他能感受到 LCL 环绕在身边的温暖，以及体内涌动的近乎野性的力量。

On the battlefield, Unit 01's jaw joints cracked; the purple beast held its head high and roared.  
战场上，初号机的下颚关节咔咔作响；那紫色的巨兽昂首咆哮。

"Captain, Pilot Ikari's sync rate is rising fast! 85, 90, 95!" Maya reported in haste, "his synchrograph is all over the place!"  
“舰长，碇真嗣的同步率正在快速上升！85，90，95！”摩耶急忙报告，“他的同步图谱完全乱了！”

"Berserk?" Dr. Akagi asked worriedly.  
"暴走？" 赤城博士担忧地问道。

"No! The pilot is in full control!" Aoba shouted in disbelief. "The AT-Field output of Unit 01 has just quintupled!"  
"不！驾驶员完全掌控着局面！" 青叶难以置信地喊道，"初号机的 AT 力场输出刚刚翻了五倍！"

Several hundred meters above them, Unit 01 uncurled its AT-Field in the form of a blast. The Israfel twins hastily raised their own AT-Field, but instantly shattered like substandard glass. Without the protection of the force field, target Alpha and Beta were pushed away from Unit 01 by the powerful explosion, crashing into and destroying several armored buildings along the way.  
在它们上方数百米处，初号机以冲击波的形式展开了 AT 力场。伊斯兰双胞胎急忙提升自己的 AT 力场，却瞬间如同劣质玻璃般破碎。失去了力场保护，目标阿尔法和贝塔被强大的爆炸力从初号机旁推开，沿途撞毁了数座装甲建筑。

Both halves of Israfel struggled back on their feet and jumped back together, merging into one body again. The Angel expanded its AT-Field one more time; its strength quadrupled instead of the simple addition of the AT-Fields of two halves. Nonetheless, its power was nowhere near Unit 01 under a near-berserk state. Two AT-Fields clashed together, making the ground shake under the enormous force.  
伊斯拉斐尔的两半身体挣扎着重新站起，然后一起跳开，再次合二为一。天使再次扩张其 AT 力场；其力量不是简单的两半 AT 力场的相加，而是四倍增强。尽管如此，它的力量远不及近乎狂暴状态的初号机。两个 AT 力场碰撞在一起，巨大的力量使得地面震动。

"Is this all you've got?!" Shinji scoffed, pushing his AT-Field forward, neutralizing the Angel's. Unit 01 leaped into the sky and landed on top of Israfel, using its prog knife to cut one of its horn-like arms off. The purple behemoth picked up the body part and placed it over its missing left forearm, its cells bonding with it and growing around it to form a fully fleshed and unarmored arm. It flexed its hand, cracking all of its newly developed digits as it did so. With a new limb, the Evangelion rose its gaze towards the Angel and opened its great maw as it made a bloodcurdling roar that turned everyone on the command deck's blood to ice.  
“你就这点本事吗？！”真嗣嗤之以鼻，推动自己的 AT 力场，中和了天使的力场。初号机一跃而起，落在伊斯拉斐尔的上方，用高振动粒子刀切下它一只角状的手臂。紫色巨人捡起那部分肢体，将其覆盖在缺失的左前臂上，细胞与之结合并围绕其生长，形成一只完全成形且无装甲的手臂。它弯曲着新生的手，活动着新长出的手指，发出噼啪声。有了新的肢体，福音战士抬起头，对着天使张开巨口，发出令人毛骨悚然的咆哮，让指挥舱内的每个人都感到血液凝固。

Shinji pulled out the other prog knife as well - one at each hand - as the Angel regenerated its own arm. He sneered at the sight, "let me see how fast you can regenerate."  
真嗣也拔出了另一把高振动粒子刀——一手一把——此时使徒正在再生它的手臂。他对此嗤之以鼻，“让我看看你能多快再生。”

With a twisted grin, Shinji maneuvered Unit 01 pounced on the Angel, wielding both of its prog knives. The purple beast crouched over Israfel, firmly suppressing it, and began brutally cutting, slicing, and chopping. The Angel shrieked in excruciating pain as pieces of its grey flesh were forcibly removed from its body, tons of LCL bursting out from the gigantic wounds.  
带着扭曲的笑容，真嗣操控初号机扑向使徒，双持高振动粒子刀。紫色巨人压在伊斯拉斐尔上方，牢牢压制住它，开始残忍地切割、劈砍。使徒发出撕心裂肺的惨叫，灰色的肉块被强行从身上剥离，大量 LCL 从巨大的伤口中喷涌而出。

People on the command deck tried their best to contain the shakings as the battle displayed on the big screen. More so for Maya Ibuki, who was responsible for monitoring Evangelion Units' vital signs, the readings of Unit 01 and its pilot _intimidated_ her. She had never seen anything like this ever before; she had heard from Akagi-Senpai that a berserk EVA could produce something alike. But right now, the Unit seemed to be perfectly under control of the pilot with an unbelievably high sync rate of 150 percent. To make things worse, she never saw such readings from a pilot. The readings, no matter how hard it was to believe, were indicating whoever inside Unit 01 was a raging beast.  
指挥甲板上的人们竭尽全力控制着因大屏幕上战斗而引起的震动。尤其是负责监控 EVA 机体生命体征的伊吹玛雅，零号机和其驾驶员的读数令她心生畏惧。她从未见过这样的情景；她曾听赤木前辈说过，狂暴的 EVA 可能会产生类似的现象。但此刻，这台机体似乎完全受驾驶员控制，同步率高达不可思议的 150%。更糟糕的是，她从未见过如此异常的驾驶员读数。这些读数，无论多么难以置信，都在表明零号机内的存在是一头狂暴的野兽。

Unit 01 was not just _fighting_ the Angel. It was _destroying_ it.  
零号机不仅仅是在与使徒战斗。它是在摧毁它。

Only one thought remained in Shinji's mind as he slaughtered the Angel.  
在屠戮使徒的过程中，真嗣心中只有一个念头。

_'You hurt Asuka' "“你伤害了明日香”_

Each and every limb on the Angel's body was being mercilessly sliced off within seconds of its reemergence. The Angel tried to split in half to escape the brutal murder, but the power needed to keep regenerating the lost flesh alone was enough to drain the S2 engine. If it forced itself to use more energy to separate, its own body would collapse first.  
天使的每一肢体在重现的瞬间便被无情地切割殆尽。天使试图分裂自身以逃脱这残酷的屠杀，但仅是维持再生失去的肉体所需的能量就足以耗尽 S2 引擎。若它强行使用更多能量来分离，其自身躯体将首先崩溃。

The battle was already over.  
战斗已然结束。

Shinji could vaguely see the two shining red cores as the Angel's was reduced to one-third of its original size, its regenerating rate failed to keep up with how fast it was losing flesh. With one final savage slicing, two cores hidden deep inside Israfel's body were exposed, and Shinji stabbed his two prog knives into both of them simultaneously.  
真嗣隐约能看到两个闪着红光的核，随着使徒的体积被削减至原来的三分之一，其再生速度已跟不上肉体消逝的迅猛。随着最后一记猛烈的切割，隐藏在伊斯拉斐尔体内的两个核心暴露无遗，真嗣同时将两把 prog 刀刺入其中。

The Angel screamed before it exploded into a giant cross. Unit 01 stood in the middle of a sea of blood, roaring triumphantly at the sky.  
使徒尖叫着，随后爆炸成一个巨大的十字形。初号机矗立在血海之中，对着天空发出胜利的咆哮。

"Is this… EVA's true form?" Ritsuko Akagi mumbled to herself, her expression screamed the word 'dread'. "Wha-what kind of beast did we create?" '_Is this also part of your scenario, Gendo?'_  
"“这难道是……EVA 的真正形态？”赤木律子喃喃自语，脸上写满了‘恐惧’二字。“我们究竟创造出了什么样的怪物？”“这也是你的剧本之一吗，碇？”

Inside the dark office, an almost invisible smirk crept up Gendo Ikari's face.  
在昏暗的办公室内，碇源堂的脸上浮现出一抹几乎难以察觉的冷笑。

"A-Angel neutralized," Maya reported in a shaky voice, "Unit 01 has shut down. The pilot vitals is returning back to normal."  
"A-天使已中和，" 真希波用颤抖的声音报告，"初号机已关闭。驾驶员生命体征正在恢复正常。"

"Roger," Misato shook her head, knowing she would never be able to look at Shinji in the same way as before, "send out the retrieval team…"  
"收到，" 美里摇了摇头，知道她再也无法以从前的方式看待真嗣了，"派出回收小组……"

Shinji got out of the entry plug deadpanned, hoping to make sure Asuka was okay as soon as possible. However, his wish had to be delayed since several Section 2 Agents intercepted him on the route. "The Commander requires your immediate presence," one of the man-in-black said in a cold voice, "please follow us."  
真嗣面无表情地从插入栓中出来，希望能尽快确认明日香是否安好。然而，他的愿望不得不推迟，因为几名第二课特工在路上拦截了他。"指挥官需要你立即前往，"其中一位黑衣人冷冷地说道，"请跟我们走。"

"Great…" Shinji murmured in exasperation.  
"真糟糕…" 真嗣无奈地喃喃自语。

The route to Gendo's office was time-consuming, considering he was outside of Geofront at that time. After one hour of traveling, he finally arrived at Gendo's office door, were still wearing the LCL drenched plug suit.  
前往碇源堂办公室的路程颇为耗时，毕竟他当时位于 Geofront 之外。经过一个小时的奔波，他终于抵达了碇源堂办公室的门前，身上依旧穿着那件浸满 LCL 的插入栓服。

"Come in," a familiar stony voice came to him.  
"进来吧，"一个熟悉而冷硬的声音传入他耳中。

"Father," Shinji said as he stopped thirty meters in front of Commander Ikari's desk. "What do you want me for?"  
"父亲，"真嗣在他面前三十米处停下，说道，"您找我有什么事？"

"Explain today's battle." Gendo fixed his cold eyes on Shinji, who kept his unwavering expression but still felt a chill ran down his spine.  
"解释一下今天的战斗。"源堂冷冷地盯着真嗣，后者保持着不动声色的表情，但仍感到一股寒意沿着脊背而下。

"Before, I was always the one syncing with Asuka, but this time the difference between Rei and Asuka's sync rates led to their failure against the Angel," Shinji explained. "I should've seen it coming, my apologies."  
"以前，我总是和明日香同步，但这次丽和明日香的同步率差异导致了她们对抗使徒的失败，" 真嗣解释道。"我本该预见到这一点，抱歉。"

"Hm," Gendo pondered for a moment, "no need. The Angel was defeated, and the scenario is not fundamentally threatened." Seeing Shinji's expression softened slightly, he added, "I want to know what happened with Unit 01."  
"嗯，" 碇源堂沉思片刻，"无需自责。使徒已被击败，局势并未受到根本性威胁。" 看到真嗣的表情稍稍缓和，他补充道，"我想知道零号机发生了什么。"

"I called for her for help," Shinji blurted out, "mother. She gave me the power to defeat the Angel."  
"我呼唤了她的帮助，" 真嗣脱口而出，"母亲。她赋予了我击败使徒的力量。"

"I see." _'So she is alive…and responsive to the outside world! Yui…wait for me!'_  
"我明白了。" '这么说她还活着…并且对外界有反应！唯…等我！'

"One more thing… what's Asuka's condition?" Shinji asked; after all, her safety was his primary concern.  
“还有一件事……明日香的情况怎么样？” 真嗣问道；毕竟，她的安全是他最关心的事。

"From the initial reports, Pilot Soryu is alive and whole, but unconscious," Gendo replied, "there's no visible physical damage. A thorough report will be filed later."  
“根据初步报告，驾驶员惣流还活着，身体完好，但处于昏迷状态，” 碇源堂回答，“没有明显的身体损伤。稍后会提交一份详细的报告。”

"That's…good to hear," Shinji sighed in relief, "if there's nothing else, I should go now." He quickly turned to leave, hoping to get to Asuka's side as soon as possible.  
“那……真是太好了，” 真嗣松了一口气，“如果没别的事，我该走了。” 他迅速转身离开，希望能尽快赶到明日香身边。

"Shinji," Gendo called out to him just before he was about to exit the office. Shinji turned around in surprise; the fact that his father never called him by his given name only increased his astonishment.  
"真嗣," 在真嗣即将离开办公室之际，源堂叫住了他。真嗣惊讶地转过身来；他的父亲从未叫过他的名字，这让他更加震惊。

"I hope she's okay. Dismissed."  
"希望她没事。你可以走了。"

Shinji blinked. He couldn't believe the words his brain registered. Did his father just…no, that couldn't be right. He never cared about anyone other than his wife. If anything, he was hoping _Yui_ was okay. There's no way he was wishing _Asuka_ to be fine…Right?  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他无法相信自己的大脑所接收到的信息。难道他的父亲刚刚……不，这不可能。他除了妻子之外从未关心过任何人。如果有什么的话，他希望唯没事。他不可能希望明日香平安无事……对吧？

Even by some cosmic fluke he did, he only said that because now Asuka was a crucial part of his scenario – Shinji almost convinced himself.  
即便真是宇宙间的某种巧合，他也只会那么说，因为如今明日香已成为他剧本中至关重要的一环——真嗣几乎让自己信以为真。

Gendo's eyes followed Shinji's back until his silhouette disappeared behind the door. He sighed heavily, preparing himself for the inevitable. As if aroused by his thought, twelve black monoliths emerged from the darkness, forming a circle around the emotionless Commander. "I think our plan has a wrinkle, Ikari," SEELE 01 started in a husky voice, "Unit 01's awakening is too early."  
碇源堂的目光紧随着真嗣的背影，直到他的身影消失在门后。他重重地叹了口气，为不可避免的事态做准备。仿佛被他的思绪所唤醒，十二座黑色巨碑从黑暗中浮现，环绕在毫无表情的指挥官周围。“我认为我们的计划出现了变数，碇，”SEELE 01 以沙哑的声音开口，“初号机的觉醒来得太早了。”

"Unit 01 did not truly awaken in today's battle," Gendo replied, his expression unwavering, "the pilot was in control the whole time."  
“初号机在今天的战斗中并未真正觉醒，”碇源堂回答，神情坚定不移，“自始至终都是驾驶员在掌控。”

"Third Child?" SEELE 04 asked in a curious tone, "how did he manage to control a berserk EVA?"  
"第三适任者？" SEELE 04 好奇地问道，"他是如何控制住狂暴的 EVA 的？"

"The EVA did not go berserk, I repeat," Gendo sounded a bit annoyed, "the EVA is connected to human emotions."  
"EVA 并未失控，我再重复一遍，" 碇源堂听起来有些不悦，"EVA 与人类的情感是相连的。"

"So you're implying it's your son who went 'berserk'?" SEELE 03 snorted, "you should come up with a better lie, Ikari."  
"所以你是暗示你儿子‘发狂’了？" SEELE 03 嗤之以鼻，"伊卡里，你该编个更好的谎话。"

"It was the truth," Gendo huffed, "Dr. Akagi's report clearly stated that the Third Child was in an extreme raging state."  
"那是事实，" 碇源堂哼了一声，"赤木博士的报告明确指出第三适格者处于极度狂暴状态。"

"Hm," SEELE 01 pondered, "do you think this may threaten the scenario?"  
"嗯，" SEELE 01 沉思道，"你认为这会威胁到剧本吗？"

"Negative. If anything his...abilities could contribute a lot fighting the Angels."  
"不对。如果有什么的话，他的...能力在对抗使徒方面能发挥很大作用。"

"I hope you're not covering for your son, Gendo," SEELE 11 spoke.  
"我希望你不是在为你的儿子遮掩，源堂，" SEELE 11 说道。

"I know what's more important. That's why I left him 10 years ago." Gendo improvised.  
"我知道什么更重要。这就是为什么十年前我离开了他。" 源堂即兴说道。

"Good. Keep an eye on any possible disturbances, especially the Third Child," SEELE 01 concluded. Gendo let out a small sigh of relief after the black monoliths disappeared. The old men were certainly getting increasingly difficult to deal with.  
"很好。留意任何可能的骚动，尤其是第三适格者，" SEELE 01 总结道。在黑色石碑消失后，碇源堂轻轻舒了一口气。这些老头子确实越来越难以应付了。

Without wasting any more time Shinji hurried to the medical wing after he exited the office. His father's words were a significant assurance; still, he couldn't help but worry about her. He knew phantom sensations of EVA could do real damage to the pilot when the sync rate was high enough. He knew Rei was okay – and _even if_ she's not, she could be replaced, while Asuka couldn't without him starting a new cycle.  
没有浪费更多时间，真嗣离开办公室后急忙赶往医疗翼。父亲的保证意义重大；然而，他还是忍不住担心她。他知道，当同步率足够高时，EVA 的幻觉感受能对驾驶员造成实际伤害。他知道丽没事——即使她有事，也可以被替换，而明日香不行，除非他重新开始一个新周期。

"Excuse me, have you seen a red-haired girl?" Shinji asked as a nurse walked past him.  
"劳驾，您见过一个红发女孩吗？" 真嗣向经过的护士问道。

"Ah, yes, she's in room 303 I believe."  
"啊，是的，我想她在 303 房间。"

"Thanks!" Shinji continued running toward his destination. During the countless cycles he went through, he'd already had a good grip on pathfinding in the maze that was Geofront. Minutes later he arrived at the ward; he didn't even bother knocking on the door before rushing into the room.  
“谢谢！” 真嗣继续朝着目的地奔跑。在经历了无数次的循环后，他对这个迷宫般的第三新东京市的导航已经了如指掌。几分钟后，他到达了病房；他甚至没费心敲门就冲进了房间。

Asuka was lying on the bed among through a white blanket. Dr. Akagi stood at her bedside, carefully taking notes on her condition. "Doctor?" He called out; the blonde turned her head to him, surprised to find him already here, "Third Child? What are you doing here?"  
明日香躺在白色毯子下的床上。赤木律子博士站在她的床边，仔细地记录着她的状况。“博士？”他喊道；金发女子转过头来，惊讶地发现他已经在这里了，“第三适格者？你在这里做什么？”

"I'm here to check on Asuka," his reply came out without hesitation, "is she okay?"  
"我来这里是为了看看明日香，"他毫不犹豫地回答，"她还好吗？"

Ritsuko was tempted to educate him on courtesy, but she shook it off, still dreading today's near-berserk state of Shinji. "Well, the scans tell me nothing except she's perfectly fine physically," Shinji let out a sigh of relief as he heard the words. "However, we don't know what the neural link did to her. We need to wait for her to wake up."  
律子本想教育他注意礼貌，但还是摇了摇头，仍然对今天真嗣近乎狂暴的状态感到畏惧。"嗯，扫描结果显示她身体状况完全正常，"听到这话，真嗣松了一口气。"不过，我们还不清楚神经链接对她造成了什么影响。我们需要等她醒来。"

"Fine… I'll wait here." Shinji grabbed a chair and sat down at her bedside. He looked at the redhead with sadness filled in his eyes, a turmoil of thoughts rampaging in his mind. Asuka got hurt, not by his father, but by _him_ – although the direct cause was the Angel, if he didn't come up with his bold plan, none of this would ever happen to her. Was this the payback he got for helping his father's evil plan?  
"好吧……我会在这里等。"真嗣抓过一把椅子，坐在她的床边。他看着红发女孩，眼中充满了悲伤，脑海中思绪纷乱。明日香受伤了，不是因为他父亲，而是因为他——尽管直接原因是使徒，但如果他没有提出那个大胆的计划，她就不会遭遇这一切。这是他帮助父亲邪恶计划的报应吗？

He was the reason she got hurt. And he had already promised to himself that he would never hurt her ever again.  
是她因为他而受伤的。而他早已向自己承诺，再也不会让她受到伤害。

_'What went wrong?'_ Shinji mused. In all of his former timelines, the events were more or less the same; it gave him a false and deadly impression that as long as he followed the general trend, everything would be okay. He relied too much on his foreknowledge and lost the ability to improvise – which now backfired at him.  
“哪里出了问题？”真嗣沉思着。在他所有的前世时间线中，事件或多或少都是相同的；这给了他一个虚假且致命的印象，即只要他遵循大致趋势，一切都会好起来。他过于依赖先知先觉，失去了即兴发挥的能力——现在这反噬了他。

He needed to prepare himself for the worst.  
他需要为最坏的情况做好准备。

His train of thought screeched to a halt as a familiar voice came to him. "Argh…"  
他的思绪戛然而止，因为一个熟悉的声音传入耳中。“啊……”

Shinji followed the voice and saw his favorite redhead had woken up, struggling to get up from the bed. "Asuka!" He exclaimed in joy, failing to hide the happiness in his voice.  
真嗣顺着声音望去，看到他最喜爱的红发女孩已经醒来，正挣扎着从床上起身。“明日香！”他兴奋地喊道，声音中难掩喜悦之情。

"How long have I been out?" Asuka said hoarsely.  
“我昏迷多久了？”明日香沙哑地问道。

"About three hours after the battle," Dr. Akagi replied, "now, how do you feel in general?"  
“战斗结束后大约三个小时，”赤城博士回答，“现在，你总体感觉如何？”

"Like I was run over by a train…through my waist…What happened?"  
“感觉像是被火车从腰间碾过……发生了什么？”

"Your EVA's spinal column was broken. You were still connected at that time, so this was to be expected. Now try to move around a little."  
“你的 EVA 脊椎断了。当时你还连接着，所以这是预料之中的。现在试着稍微动一动。”

Shinji watched with a small smile as his love moved her head, then her arm, then-  
真嗣带着一丝微笑看着他的爱人移动头部，然后是手臂，接着——

Feeling his world tumbling down, Shinji's smile collapsed as he heard her later words.  
听到她后来的话，真嗣的世界仿佛崩塌了，他的笑容也随之消失。

"I-I-c-can't feel my l-legs."  
"我-我-我-我的腿没知觉了。"

*第十章*: 第十章：命运的选择

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》

**Chapter 10: Choice of Fate  
第十章：命运的选择**

Asuka's eyes grudgingly cracked open, finding herself staring at an unfamiliar ceiling, and was immediately assaulted by a wave of nausea and pain. She was lying on her back covered by a white sheet; some parts of her body hurt, others were somewhat numb – but she was indeed alive. The recollection of the latest battle slowly emerged from her mind as her consciousness returned. _'Oh shit…I lost…again…'_ She felt a wave of uncontrollable grief surge through her body.  
明日香不情愿地睁开双眼，发现自己正凝视着一片陌生的天花板，随即被一阵恶心与疼痛的浪潮袭击。她仰面躺着，身上盖着一条白床单；身体的某些部位疼痛，另一些则有些麻木——但她确实还活着。随着意识的恢复，最近那场战斗的记忆缓缓浮现于脑海。'该死……我又输了……'一股无法抑制的悲伤涌遍全身。

She was in the hospital, which meant someone else had defeated the Angel. Considering Israfel required two EVAs to beat, Shinji definitely got a share of the kill. Unacceptable failure. It was supposed to be _her_ victory, and now she was saved by him and the _doll_.  
她躺在医院里，这意味着有人击败了使徒。考虑到伊斯瑞尔需要两台 EVA 才能打败，真嗣无疑分得了一杯羹。不可接受的失败。本该是她的胜利，如今却被他和那个玩偶所救。

"Argh…" Asuka groaned as she tried to get into a sitting position, but failed. She felt like she was missing something.  
""啊……"" 明日香呻吟着试图坐起身，却失败了。她感觉好像少了些什么。

"Asuka!" The voice of a familiar boy came to her. She slowly turned her head in the direction of the voice, seeing Shinji was sitting beside her bed, his eyes expressed genuine concern that had been starting to melt her heart. Why would he stay by her bedside? Did he care about her that much? "How long have I been out?" She asked in a hoarse voice.  
""明日香！"" 一个熟悉的男孩声音传来。她缓缓将头转向声音的方向，看到真嗣坐在她的床边，眼中流露出真切的担忧，这开始融化了她的心。他为何会守在她的床边？他真的那么在乎她吗？""我昏迷多久了？"" 她用沙哑的声音问道。

"About three hours after the battle," Ritsuko Akagi's dutiful voice came to her, "now, how do you feel in general?"  
"战斗结束大约三个小时后，"赤木律子尽职的声音传来，"现在，你总体感觉如何？"

"Like I was run over by a train…through my waist," Asuka said in a displeased expression. "What happened?"  
“感觉像是被火车从腰间碾过一样。”明日香带着不满的表情说道，“发生了什么？”

"Your EVA's spinal column was broken. You were still connected at that time, so this was to be expected. Now try to move around a little."  
“你的 EVA 脊椎断了。当时你还连接着，所以这是预料之中的。现在试着稍微动一动。”

Asuka nodded and focused her thoughts on controlling the muscles. She could turn her head, her arms were working fine, she could…  
明日香点点头，集中精神控制肌肉。她能转动头部，手臂也运作正常，她可以……

"I-I-c-can't feel my l-legs," said Asuka, her voice trembling. She pinched her thigh, her fingers could feel the pressure, but her leg couldn't. "I c-can't feel them…" She could see Shinji's eyes went wide, his expression inscrutable. "Please, doctor, tell me I'm not crippled."  
"我-我-我-我的腿没-没感觉了，"明日香颤抖着声音说。她捏了捏大腿，手指能感觉到压力，但腿却毫无知觉。"我感觉不到它们……"她看到真嗣的眼睛睁大了，表情难以捉摸。"请告诉我，医生，我不是瘫痪了。"

"Hm, interesting," Ritsuko massaged her chin, "your physical check came healthy, CAT scan tells us nothing wrong…"  
"嗯，有意思，"律子揉着下巴说，"你的身体检查结果很健康，CAT 扫描也没发现任何异常……"

"But I can't feel my legs!" Asuka cried, "something's obviously wrong!"  
"但我的腿没有知觉了！" 明日香哭喊道，"显然有什么不对劲！"

"There's still so much we don't know about Evangelion technology," Ritsuko remarked casually, "your…incident could provide some useful data-"  
"我们对 EVA 技术还有很多不了解的地方，" 律子随意地评论道，"你的……事故可能会提供一些有用的数据——"

"I'm disabled, DOCTOR, and that's what you're fucking concerned with?!" Asuka yelled incredulously, "seriously, shouldn't you be thinking about how to get me back to normal?!"  
"我是残疾人，医生，这就是你他妈关心的？！" 明日香难以置信地喊道，"说真的，你不应该考虑如何让我恢复正常吗？！"

"I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with your body," Dr. Akagi replied in a stern voice, "if anything it's your head messing with you, which I have no idea how to deal with. In other words, the damage might be permanent at worst."  
"我很抱歉，但你的身体没有任何问题，" 赤木博士用严肃的语气回答，"如果有问题，那也是你的头脑在作祟，对此我毫无头绪。换句话说，最坏的情况是，这种损害可能是永久性的。"

"Permanent…" Asuka started giggling, then it became a bout of hysterical laughter. "Permanent damage…"  
"永久…" 明日香开始咯咯笑起来，随后变成了一阵歇斯底里的大笑。"永久性损伤…"

"There must be something we can do to cure her, right doctor?" Shinji asked worriedly. If Asuka became crippled, he didn't dare to think how much it would hurt her pride, not to mention she probably couldn't pilot an EVA anymore, which would hurt her more.  
"一定有什么办法可以治愈她，对吧医生？" 真嗣担忧地问道。如果明日香残疾了，他不敢想象这对她的自尊心会造成多大的伤害，更不用说她可能再也无法驾驶 EVA 了，这会让她更加痛苦。

The downward spiral of Asuka came much faster than he thought. And it was majorly his fault.  
明日香的急转直下比他预想的要快得多。而这主要都是他的错。

"I'm sorry, Shinji, but there's nothing I can do for now," Ritsuko closed her notebook, "I'll try my best to come up with solutions, but I can't make promises. After all, it's EVA we're dealing with."  
"对不起，真嗣，但目前我无能为力，" 律子合上笔记本，"我会尽力想出解决方案，但我不能保证。毕竟，我们面对的是 EVA。"

Shinji felt a cold ball grew in his stomach. Ritsuko Akagi, the head of project E, the most intelligent person in NERV, was the best shot to help Asuka. If she admitted she couldn't do anything, then no one else could.  
真嗣感到一股寒意在胃里凝结。赤木律子，E 计划的首席，NERV 中最聪明的人，是帮助明日香的最佳人选。如果她承认自己无能为力，那么其他人也无计可施了。

"You can go home if you want, but you'll need a wheelchair. Shinji," Ritsuko turned to the boy with a serious expression, "will you take care of our patient? I mean, help her move around and all that."  
"如果你想的话可以回家，但你需要一个轮椅。真嗣，"律子转向男孩，表情严肃，"你能照顾我们的病人吗？我是说，帮她移动和做其他事情。"

"Sure, doctor," Shinji replied. A glance at the redhead he could clearly see unwillingness and refusal in her eyes. He knew Asuka wanted to be independent; relying on someone else, for _basic life necessities,_ would be a massive blow to her ego.  
"当然，医生，"真嗣回答。他瞥了一眼红发女孩，清楚地看到她眼中的不情愿和拒绝。他知道明日香想要独立；依赖别人，哪怕是基本的生活需求，对她来说都是巨大的打击。

Maybe letting her move around in the wheelchair by herself would be a better idea…  
也许让她自己用轮椅移动会是个更好的主意……

The wheelchair was nothing like Shinji had expected to see, though. To say NERV was technologically advanced would be a colossal understatement. The wheelchair NERV gave Asuka was more of a vehicle than medical equipment. It could move by itself using an electric engine, controlled by a console installed on the right armrest.  
这轮椅与真嗣所预想的截然不同。说 NERV 在技术上先进无比，简直是轻描淡写。NERV 给明日香配备的轮椅与其说是医疗设备，不如说更像一辆车。它可以通过安装在右侧扶手上的控制台，利用电动引擎自行移动。

"Okay, be careful," Ritsuko said as Shinji slowly lifted Asuka up from the bed, carrying her to the wheelchair. It took Shinji and a lot of persuasions and several miserably failed attempts by herself to convince Asuka to finally agree on letting him help her. The most convenient way for Shinji to put her onto the wheelchair was to carry her princess style, which the redhead felt oddly comfortable with. The fact that Shinji, who could grope a feel on her ass anytime he preferred, while she couldn't do anything about it since she couldn't feel it, actively avoided touching her sensitive spots, made Asuka put more trust in him taking care of her.  
“好，小心点。”律子说道，真嗣缓缓地将明日香从床上抱起，带她到轮椅旁。真嗣费了不少口舌，加上几次糟糕的尝试，才终于说服明日香同意让他帮忙。最方便的方式是公主抱，这让红发少女感到意外的舒适。尽管真嗣随时可以趁机摸她的臀部，而她因感觉不到而无可奈何，但他却主动避开了她的敏感部位，这让明日香对他照顾自己的信任增加了几分。

But it didn't soothe her sore mood a bit.  
但这丝毫没有缓解她糟糕的心情。

It was supposed to be the most glorious day of her career as an EVA pilot – surpassing the invincible Shinji-sama in terms of kill counts, sync rate, and combat experience. Instead, she lost to the same Angel twice, and lost her legs – possibly permanently. She barely held back the tears that threatened to come out from the corner of her eyes.  
这本应是她作为 EVA 驾驶员职业生涯中最辉煌的一天——在击杀数、同步率和战斗经验上超越无敌的真嗣大人。然而，她却两次败给了同一个使徒，并失去了双腿——可能永久性的。她勉强忍住了眼角即将涌出的泪水。

Which led to another question. "Doctor?" Asuka probed, her voice extremely nervous, "can I pilot the EVA ever again?"  
这又引出了另一个问题。“医生？”明日香试探性地问道，声音异常紧张，“我还能再次驾驶 EVA 吗？”

Shinji frowned. The redhead's unhealthy bond to her EVA was another standing issue he needed to take care of. He almost chuckled at her hypocritical attitude; a moment ago, she was berating Ritsuko because she cared more about 'getting useful data for Project E' than her health condition, now she was essentially following her example. Shinji sighed internally – among three people here in the ward, if anyone had the unhealthiest bond with the EVA, it was neither Ritsuko nor Asuka. "Seriously, Asuka, you should-"  
真嗣皱起了眉头。红发少女与 EVA 之间不健康的羁绊是他需要解决的另一个长期问题。他几乎要笑出声来，她的虚伪态度令人难以忍受；刚才她还因为惣流更关心“为 E 计划获取有用数据”而不是她的健康状况而责备她，现在她却几乎在模仿她的做法。真嗣内心叹息——在这间病房里的三个人中，如果有人与 EVA 的羁绊最不健康，那既不是惣流也不是明日香。“说真的，明日香，你应该……”

"Shut up you!" Asuka barked, her voice dripping venom, "Doctor?" She probed again, dreading that the answer might not be what she wanted to hear.  
"闭嘴，你！" 明日香厉声喝道，声音中充满了毒液，"医生？" 她再次试探，害怕答案可能不是她想听到的。

"I'm not sure…technically as long as you have a working brain, it should work," Ritsuko Akagi responded with a thoughtful expression. "However, we still need a sync test to be sure."  
"我不确定……从技术上讲，只要有正常运作的大脑，就应该能行，" 赤城律子带着沉思的表情回答，"不过，我们还是需要进行同步测试来确认。"

"When can you arrange it?" Asuka asked impatiently.  
"你什么时候能安排？" 明日香不耐烦地问。

"Asuka, you need to focus on your recovery first," Shinji interjected in a firm voice. "I suppose the next Angel wouldn't come in several weeks," he carefully chose his words. The next one would be Sandalphon – and he already had an idea how to defeat it by himself. "You'll have a better chance syncing with your EVA under a better health condition, don't you think?"  
"明日香，你首先需要专注于康复，" 真嗣坚定地说道。"我想下一个使徒不会在几周内出现，" 他谨慎地选择措辞。下一个将是桑达枫——他已经有了独自击败它的想法。"在更好的健康状况下，你与 EVA 同步的机会会更大，你不觉得吗？"

Asuka bit down on her lips, swallowing down the hot retort. As hard as it was for her to admit, Shinji was making a good point. "Shinji here's right, we don't expect you do well in your EVA under the current situation. I'll arrange the next sync test in…about five days. Sounds good?"  
明日香咬紧嘴唇，咽下了那股激烈的反驳。尽管难以承认，但真嗣说得有道理。"真嗣说得对，我们不期望你在目前的情况下能很好地驾驶 EVA。我会在……大约五天后安排下一次同步测试。听起来怎么样？"

"Alright." Asuka conceded, her expression mixed with pain and resignation. "Now I want to go home…"  
"好吧。" 明日香让步了，她的表情混合着痛苦和无奈。"现在我想回家……"

Asuka didn't say a word the entire way home, much to Shinji's apprehension. She kept staring out the window deep in thoughts, ignoring all kinds of small gestures of support Shinji gave her. He silently cursed; if getting defeated by Israfel in the first round was 'a hit on her ego' he wanted, then the recent events could be considered as a nuclear strike.  
回家的路上，明日香一句话也没说，这让真嗣感到十分不安。她一直凝视着窗外，陷入沉思，对真嗣给予的各种小支持视而不见。他默默咒骂；如果第一轮就被伊斯拉斐尔击败是‘打击了她的自尊’，那么最近发生的事情简直就是核打击。

Shinji carried her off the car with utmost care after arriving at their apartment and putting her down in the wheelchair that Misato brought to them from the vehicle. As soon as she settled on her seat, Asuka pushed the joystick forward, heading to the elevator, still not saying so much as a 'thanks'. It hurt Shinji a lot to watch her in this state; he hoped to have fun with her while they still can – before the later Angels arrive. Time around Israfel was supposed to be _light,_ and if the mood had already darkened to such degree, what would the later Angels bring, then?  
真嗣小心翼翼地将她从车上抱下来，到达公寓后把她放在了美里从车里带来的轮椅上。她一坐稳，明日香就推着操纵杆向前，朝电梯驶去，连一句'谢谢'都没说。看着她这副模样，真嗣心里很不是滋味；他本希望在后来的使徒到来之前能和她一起开心一下。伊斯拉斐尔出现的时候应该是轻松愉快的，如果气氛已经变得如此沉重，那么后来的使徒又会带来什么呢？

"Baka, are you coming or not?!" His dark train of thoughts abruptly crashed as an annoyed voice came to him; following the voice he could see Asuka waiting impatiently inside the elevator, tapping her finger in a rhythmic fashion. "Three seconds you don't come and I'll leave!"  
“笨蛋，你到底来不来？！”他阴郁的思绪突然被一个不耐烦的声音打断；顺着声音，他看到明日香不耐烦地在电梯里等着，手指有节奏地敲打着。“三秒钟你不进来，我就走了！”

Without hesitation Shinji dashed to the elevator, blocking the closing door just in time. The half-a-minute elevator ride was in awkward silence. Asuka sank deeper and deeper into her swirl of thoughts; now that she was disabled, how should she perform the living routine, then? She couldn't so much as freely move around in the apartment anymore without needing someone else's help, and she hated being dependent. Even though she could trust Shinji to take care of her for many things, there were some things she wasn't comfortable enough to let him do. For instance, bathing, peeing, and pooping – there's no way she would let him help her with those.  
毫不犹豫，真嗣冲向电梯，及时挡住了即将关闭的门。这半分钟的电梯之旅在尴尬的沉默中度过。明日香陷入了越来越深的思绪漩涡；如今她行动不便，该如何应对日常生活呢？她甚至无法在公寓里自由活动，而需要他人的帮助，这让她讨厌依赖别人。尽管她可以信任真嗣在很多事情上照顾她，但有些事情她还是无法放心让他来做。比如洗澡、上厕所——她绝不会让他帮忙做这些。

Thankfully there's still Misato…  
幸好还有美里……

Asuka shook the unhelpful thoughts off as the elevator arrived on the seventh floor. She drove the wheelchair to the apartment door, then irately found out the size of it wouldn't allow the wheelchair to go through. She let out a frustrated groan that came to Shinji's ear as if it was a stinging needle. The said boy hastily got to her side and picked her up from the wheelchair, carrying her into the apartment. "Put me on my bed," Asuka demanded as they came across the living room.  
电梯到达七楼时，明日香甩开了这些无益的念头。她驾驶轮椅来到公寓门前，然后恼火地发现门的大小不允许轮椅通过。她发出一声沮丧的呻吟，传到真嗣耳中就像一根刺。真嗣急忙赶到她身边，从轮椅上抱起她，将她带进公寓。“把我放到床上，”明日香在他们经过客厅时命令道。

Shinji complied without a problem. From the looks of him, Shinji definitely wasn't the type of a grown man like Kaji she had her eyes for, but Asuka's cheek started heating up, and her heart fluttered as she was carried princess style in his arms. Just several days ago, Shinji was constantly bickering with her and annoying her by pushing her to do things she didn't want to, but now he was taking care of her without complaining nor impatience.  
真嗣毫无问题地照做了。从外表看，真嗣显然不是像加持那样成熟的男人，但当她像公主一样被他抱在怀里时，明日香的脸颊开始发热，心跳加速。就在几天前，真嗣还一直在和她争吵，逼她做不想做的事，但现在他却毫无怨言和急躁地照顾着她。

What did she do to deserve all this?  
她做了什么值得这一切？

Nonetheless, such trivial thoughts were the least she had to worry about right now.  
尽管如此，这些琐碎的想法现在却是她最不需要担心的。

"Asuka, do you need something? Water, food?" Shinji probed after he helped Asuka settle down on the bed. He waited patiently for a reply, but got nothing from the unresponsive redhead.  
“明日香，你需要什么吗？水，还是食物？”真嗣在帮明日香安顿到床上后试探性地问道。他耐心等待着回应，但那位毫无反应的红发女孩什么也没给他。

He could no longer just sit aside and wait for Asuka to allow him to help her. He knew perfectly well that if he didn't interfere, then her wallowing in agony would eventually be the end of her. The redhead pulled her limp legs closer to her chest with her arms, curling up in the corner of the bed.  
他不能再只是坐在一旁等待明日香允许他帮助她了。他非常清楚，如果他不介入，那么她沉浸在痛苦中最终会毁了她。红发女孩用双臂将她无力的双腿拉近胸前，蜷缩在床角。

This wasn't the girl he was expecting to see at this period of the timeline. What he saw wasn't the Asuka Langley Soryu he had come to know and fell in love with. What he saw was a sad and lonely little girl who was too afraid to leave the safety of her corner and be a part of the rest of the world. She was so small and so weak that Shinji knew she could land on a pillow and still shatter into thousands of pieces. She just looked like she wanted to be left alone, and to remain alone until the rest of the world had forgotten about her.  
这不是他在这一时间线上预期会见到的女孩。他所看到的，不是他逐渐了解并爱上的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。他眼前的是一个悲伤而孤独的小女孩，她太过害怕离开自己的角落，不敢融入外面的世界。她如此渺小脆弱，仿佛落在枕头上都会碎成千片。她看起来只希望被独自留下，直到世界其他部分都遗忘了她。

"Asuka," Shinji sighed, looking up towards her window to see the full moon's gentle light shimmering down upon them. "I want for you to know that I'm here for you." Still no response coming from her. Asuka continued to remain curled up and unresponsive, his words seemingly falling empty onto her. He expected as much.  
"明日香," 真嗣叹息着，抬头望向她的窗户，只见满月的柔和光芒洒落下来。"我想让你知道，我在这里支持你。"她依然没有回应。明日香继续蜷缩着，毫无反应，他的话似乎落在了空处。他早有预料。

"Why are you doing this?" A barely audible whisper finally came from the other side of the room after what felt like an eternity for him, causing Shinji to turn his attention to the source of the noise.  
"你为什么要这样做？" 在他感觉仿佛过了一个世纪之后，房间另一边终于传来一声几乎听不见的低语，这让真嗣将注意力转向了声音的来源。

"Because I want to be here for you, Asuka." He answered, giving her the most honest response he had.  
"因为我想在你身边，明日香。" 他回答道，给了她最真诚的答复。

"But I want you to leave me alone." She growled, her voice partially muffled by her face being buried in her legs.  
"但我想让你离开我。" 她咆哮道，声音因脸埋在双腿间而有些模糊。

"But why? Why do you want me to lea-"  
"但为什么？你为什么想让我离开——"

"Because I just do, damn it!" Asuka screamed, instinctively trying to get up into a sitting position, but miserably failed, fueling her anger even more. "Why can't you get it through your thick skull that I just don't want you around?! Is it really that hard to understand?!"  
"因为我就是想这样，该死！" 明日香尖叫着，本能地试图坐起身来，却悲惨地失败了，这更加剧了她的愤怒。"你那厚脑袋怎么就是不明白我不想你在这儿？！真的有那么难理解吗？！"

Shinji felt a tug at his heart. He bit down on his upper lip to try to hold back the pain that her words inflicted upon him, but even an earthquake wouldn't make him leave. He knew perfectly well if there was ever a time that she needed to be held and told that someone was there for her the most, this was the time. "No." His reply came cold and stony, almost reminiscent of his father's tone of voice. "I'm not leaving you."  
真嗣感到心被揪了一下。他咬紧上唇，试图压抑她的话语带来的痛苦，但即使是地震也无法让他离开。他非常清楚，如果有什么时候她最需要被拥抱并被告知有人在她身边，那就是现在。“不。”他的回答冷硬如石，几乎让人想起他父亲的语气。“我不会离开你。”

"You're such an idiot!" She hissed, slamming back down on the bed, "Please, Shinji." Her stifled sobs continued to carry through. "Please just leave me alone. It'll make things easier for both of us."  
“你真是个傻瓜！”她低声怒斥，重重地躺回床上，“求你了，真嗣。”她的哽咽声持续传来。“请让我一个人待着。这样对我们俩都好。”

"You know I can't do that," Shinji shot back, "I'm your friend, Asuka, and I can't stand seeing you like this. If you really want to make things easier for us, then just tell me what you need."  
"你知道我不能那样做，" 真嗣反驳道，"我是你的朋友，明日香，我不忍心看你这样。如果你真的想让我们都好过些，那就告诉我你需要什么。"

Asuka chuckled, then let out a long sigh. "You're really an idiot…" She shook her head in resignation. "Shinji?"  
明日香轻笑一声，然后长叹一口气。"你真是个傻瓜……"她无奈地摇了摇头。"真嗣？"

"Yes, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"Can you make me some baked cakes? I don't fancy anything with too much grease right now."  
"你能给我做些烤蛋糕吗？我现在不想吃太油腻的东西。"

"Sure thing, Asuka," Shinji smiled a careful, if not happy smile, and proceeded to fulfill her wishes.  
“当然，明日香，” 真嗣小心翼翼地，如果不是开心地笑了笑，然后继续满足她的愿望。

"So you want to do the sync test on Monday? Why on a school day?" Ritsuko Akagi's inquisitive tone came through the speaker; on the other side of the phone, Asuka tightened her grip on the phone, "because I don't want Shinji to go there." She replied in a low voice, "Misato can carry me to Geofront. I've asked her. She said she needed to go there for paperwork that day, anyway."  
“所以你想周一进行同步测试？为什么选在上学日？” 赤城丽子通过扬声器传来的语气充满好奇；电话另一端，明日香握紧了电话，“因为我不想让真嗣去那里。”她低声回答，“美里可以带我去地底都市。我已经问过她了。她说那天她也需要去那里处理文件。”

"Hm," Dr. Akagi pondered for a second, "Do you feel fit enough for it, though?"  
“嗯，” 赤城博士沉思了一会儿，“不过，你觉得自己身体状况适合吗？”

"I'll be fine, don't worry about it." Asuka said, "and… don't tell Shinji about this, okay?"  
"我没事的，别担心。" 明日香说，"还有……别告诉真嗣这件事，好吗？"

"Alright, if you say so," Ritsuko replied, "see you on Monday, then."  
"好吧，既然你这么说，" 律子回答，"那我们周一见。"

Asuka let out a heavy sigh after she hung up the phone. She really didn't want Shinji to be involved in this any more than he already had. For one, her pride wouldn't let her appear needy more than absolutely necessary; for another, she couldn't decipher the true intentions behind his actions. Why would he suddenly care about her so much? She still feared it was some kind of a game he was playing with her, although she already trusted him more than anyone else – maybe except Kaji.  
挂断电话后，明日香重重地叹了口气。她真的不希望真嗣再卷入这件事了，他已经牵扯得够多了。一方面，她的自尊不允许自己显得过于需要帮助；另一方面，她无法解读他行为的真正意图。为什么他会突然如此关心她？她仍然担心这可能是他在和她玩某种游戏，尽管她已经比信任任何人都要信任他——也许除了加持。

Maybe. 也许。

The cool morning breeze blew gently across Asuka's pale face, more or less soothing her bitter mood. Requiring constant nursing, especially from Shinji, wasn't her idea, but professional medical advice came from Dr. Akagi, approved by the Commander as an order.  
清晨的凉风轻轻吹拂过明日香苍白的脸颊，或多或少缓解了她的苦闷心情。需要真嗣不断照顾，尤其是来自他的关怀，并非她的本意，但这是赤木博士的专业建议，并得到了司令的批准作为命令。

Needing him to take care of her daily life routine in the apartment was already bad enough for her pride; now the constant company even extended to outside – she wanted to 'walk around' in the park in the morning, and since it was a Sunday, without school Shinji insisted on accompanying her.  
让他照顾她的日常生活已经够伤她的自尊了；现在这种陪伴甚至延伸到了户外——她想在早上'在公园里走走'，因为是周日，没有学校，真嗣坚持要陪着她。

Thankfully he still had to go to school during schooldays…  
幸好他工作日还得去上学……

Asuka shook the thoughts off, focusing on the road in front of her. The design of her electric wheelchair wouldn't allow a velocity more than 10 kilometers an hour, a usual jogging speed. Still, it was the first time driving something that wasn't an Evangelion, and she needed to pay utmost attention to avoid hitting random things on the road.  
明日香甩开这些思绪，专注于前方的道路。她的电动轮椅设计时速无法超过每小时 10 公里，相当于一般的慢跑速度。尽管如此，这是她第一次驾驶非 EVA 的交通工具，她必须全神贯注，以免撞上路上的各种障碍物。

Her scarcely improved mood only sunk lower when she noticed the looks she got from the pedestrians. They were different from what she got from school; instead of admiring, sometimes fearful, sometimes even lecherous gazes, people were looking at her with _pity._  
她那稍有好转的心情在注意到行人的目光时更加低落。这些目光与她在学校所遇到的截然不同；不再是仰慕、有时甚至是恐惧或色眯眯的眼神，人们现在看她的眼神充满了怜悯。

Her stomach clenched. She felt like she wanted to puke. At herself.  
她的胃部紧缩，感觉自己想吐，对着自己。

It only became worse when a group of kids looked at her and started giggling. Of course they were instantly silenced by the soul-piercing death glare she and Shinji shot out in unison, but the damage was already done.  
当一群孩子看着她并开始窃笑时，情况变得更糟了。当然，他们立刻被她和真嗣同时射出的穿透灵魂的死亡凝视所震慑，但伤害已经造成。

With a forceful pull on the console, the wheelchair stopped abruptly, surprising Shinji a little. "What's wrong, Asuka?" He probed cautiously.  
用力一拉操纵台，轮椅突然停了下来，让真嗣有点惊讶。“怎么了，明日香？”他小心翼翼地问道。

_"Everything is fucking wrong!"_ Asuka suddenly screamed in German after a few seconds of silence, which in turn caused more people to turn their heads in her direction. _"I hate you, I hate everyone!" 'But I hate myself the most…'_  
“一切都他妈的错了！”沉默几秒后，明日香突然用德语尖叫起来，这又引得更多人转头看向她。“我恨你，我恨所有人！”‘但我最恨的是我自己……’

Although her last thought didn't articulate into words, Shinji could almost swear he heard them. "Asuka…do you want to go home?"  
"尽管她最后的念头并未化为言语，但真嗣几乎可以发誓他听到了。“明日香…你想回家吗？””

"Home?" Asuka sneered, "what's the point of having someone useless like me in your home? I can only-"  
“回家？”明日香嗤之以鼻，“像我这样无用的人在你家有什么意义？我只能——”

"SHUT UP and LISTEN," Shinji cut her off in a firm voice, sending a chill ran down the redhead's spine. She had never heard him talking in this way before, or maybe she did, just not from him. Even though Shinji liked to banter with her, but in retrospect, Asuka could swear he never sounded…angry. "Home is not a place, Asuka. There are people who care about you. Me, Misato-san, Kaji-san, and your friend at school - Horaki-san, we all care about you. So I don't want to hear you say that ever again."  
“闭嘴，听我说，”真嗣用坚定的语气打断了她，让红发女孩的脊背一阵发凉。她从未听过他用这种方式说话，或许有过，但不是从他口中。尽管真嗣喜欢和她斗嘴，但回想起来，明日香可以发誓他从未听起来…如此生气。“家不是一个地方，明日香。有在乎你的人。我，美里小姐，加持先生，还有你在学校的朋友——洞木同学，我们都关心你。所以我不希望再听到你说那样的话。”

"Whatever…" Asuka conceded. She had to admit, though, Shinji was making a good point…there _were_ people who still care about her…  
“随便吧……”明日香让步道。不过她不得不承认，真嗣说得有道理……还有人关心她……

The EVA cages buzzed to life as the testing machines started running. "Entry Plug inserted…Commence Entry Plug LCL injection. LCL filled. Establishing A10 connections. A-10 connections established and stable. All circuits are operational…" Asuka sat nervously in her test plug, trying to force her will on the stupid machine. However, no matter how hard she tried, the EVA wouldn't listen to her, as if she was blocked by a door.  
EVA 驾驶舱随着测试机器启动而嗡嗡作响。“插入栓已插入……开始注入插入栓 LCL。LCL 已充满。建立 A10 连接。A-10 连接已建立并稳定。所有电路正常运行……”明日香紧张地坐在她的测试插入栓中，试图将自己的意志强加给这台愚蠢的机器。然而，无论她怎么努力，EVA 就是不听她的，仿佛被一扇门挡住了。

_I don't want you to get hurt anymore…darling. I have to protect you…  
我不想你再受到伤害了……亲爱的。我必须保护你……_

Asuka felt like the door was slammed on her face.  
明日香感觉自己像是被门狠狠地拍在了脸上。

"Absolute Borderline…" Maya paused at the step, frowning, "Akagi-Senpai, she's not even passing the Absolute Borderline."  
“绝对底线……”真嗣在台阶上停顿了一下，皱着眉头说，“赤木前辈，她连绝对底线都没达到。”

Ritsuko sighed, looking down at the readings from Asuka's sync score. "This was to be expected…"  
律子叹了口气，低头看着明日香的同步率分数。“这是预料之中的……”

Misato remained on the far end of the room, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed. Normally she would be right there next to her old college friend to act as a second set of eyes, not that Ritsuko needed them. In recent days though, the Captain had started to embrace the gift of ignorance. She knew that Asuka's scores would go down, but somehow she felt that if she just remained oblivious then all of the things that happened recently would just go away. "What do you want to do about it?" It was all she could ask.  
美里站在房间的另一端，双臂交叉倚靠在墙上。通常她会紧挨着这位大学时代的老朋友，充当第二双眼睛，尽管律子并不需要。然而最近，这位上尉开始享受起无知带来的礼物。她知道明日香的分数会下降，但不知为何，她觉得只要自己保持无知，最近发生的那些事情就会自行消失。“你想怎么办？”她只能这样问。

"We should start looking for a new pilot." Akagi was straight to the point about it.  
“我们应该开始寻找新的驾驶员。”赤木直子直截了当地说。

"You can't do that," Misato carried no emotional weight in her tone. Instead she came across more so as if telling someone they couldn't stop the Earth from spinning. "Piloting the EVA is all Asuka knows."  
“你不能那样做，”美里的语气中没有丝毫情感色彩。她更像是在告诉某人，他们无法阻止地球自转。“驾驶 EVA 是明日香唯一知道的事。”

"Unfortunately my job isn't to make the dreams of children come true, Captain." Ritsuko started going about various tasks at her computer as she spoke, including sending her suggestion to the Commander for approval. "I thought you'd realize that by now."  
"遗憾的是，我的工作并不是实现孩子们的梦想，上尉。" 赤木律子边说边在电脑上处理各种任务，包括向指挥官发送她的建议以供批准。"我想你现在应该明白这一点了。"

"It's still fucked up." "这还是很操蛋。"

"Irrelevant. We need to-" Ritsuko was stopped as the echoic sound of Misato's boot stomping on the ground filled the room.  
"无关紧要。我们需要——" 丽苏科的话被美里靴子重重踏地的回响打断，声音在房间里回荡。

"It's still not right, god damn it!" Her tongue was the gun, and her words were the bullets that pierced through the faux blonde. "She's like this because of what she did _for us, for the whole world,_" Misato snarled, "and now we're just gonna throw her away like a broken tool?!"  
"还是不对，该死的！" 她的舌头如枪，话语如子弹，穿透了那个假金发女郎。"她之所以这样，是因为她为我们，为整个世界所做的一切，" 美里咆哮道，"而现在我们却要把她像破工具一样丢弃吗？！"

Akagi remained motionless for a moment, thinking over her words before turning around to face the lavender-haired woman she was sure was now standing up firm and straight "You're putting the cart before the horse, Captain. NERV exists to defeat the Angels and ensure humanity's survival. You can't put her safety over the world's just because you've attached to her."  
赤木律子静立片刻，思索着她的话，随后转身面对那位她确信此刻正坚定站立的紫发女子，"你这是本末倒置，美里队长。NERV 的存在是为了击败使徒，确保人类的生存。你不能因为对她有了感情，就把她的安全置于世界之上。"

"Well excuse me for wanting to treat her like a human being!"  
"好吧，原谅我想要把她当人对待！"

The fire in her eyes burned hotter than the sun, but the doctor kept hers fixed onto the Captain's, not flinching in the slightest. "Excuse me for concerning about the human race then, Captain!" The blonde doctor shot back, "It's not like I want her out of Unit 02, but it's what needs to be done. Her sync rate is so low she couldn't even move a finger of her EVA," the blonde stated firmly. "In simple terms, she couldn't pilot anymore. Moreover," she added in a softer voice, "do you really think putting a disabled pilot on the frontline would be better for her? Just think about it."  
她眼中的火焰比太阳还要炽热，但医生始终坚定地注视着上尉，丝毫没有退缩。“那么，请原谅我关心人类种族，上尉！”金发医生反击道，“我不是想让她离开 02 号机，但这是必须做的。她的同步率太低，连 EVA 的一根手指都动不了，”金发医生坚定地说。“简单来说，她不能再驾驶了。而且，”她用更柔和的声音补充道，“你真的认为让一个残疾飞行员在前线会更好吗？好好想想吧。”

Misato bit down on her lips. No matter how much she wanted to deny it, she couldn't escape from the mountain of evidence that stood before her. On second thought, perhaps not letting her pilot would actually do good on her…who knew whether the next Angel would kill her or not if she's under such a state?  
美里咬紧了嘴唇。无论她多么想否认，眼前堆积如山的证据让她无法逃避。再想想，或许不让她驾驶真的对她有好处……谁知道在这种状态下，下一个使徒会不会杀了她？

"Fine… what're you gonna do, then?"  
“好吧……那你打算怎么做？”

"Temporarily pull her out of the active roster. We'll let her try again if her injuries heal." Ritsuko replied, "that's all I can do for her for now." She held up her laptop, "the Commander had already approved it, saying 'the safety of Second Child is our primary concern'." _'And I thought you care about no one but Yui…or was I wrong?'_ "It's now officially an order."  
"暂时将她从现役名单中撤下。如果她的伤势痊愈，我们会让她再试一次。" 丽苏科回答道，"这是我目前能为她做的全部了。" 她举起笔记本电脑，"指挥官已经批准了，说'二号适格者的安全是我们的首要考虑'。" '我还以为你只关心唯……还是我错了？' "现在这已成为正式命令。"

"Alright…" Misato sighed, opening up a comm channel to the entry plug. "Asuka?"  
"好吧……" 美里叹了口气，打开了一个通往插入栓的通讯频道。"明日香？"

"Yes, Misato? How am I doing?" Came Asuka's nervous voice. She was expecting a drop of sync rate of 30, or even 40 percent, considering how difficult it was for her to connect with the EVA. Maybe-  
“是的，美里？我表现得怎么样？”明日香紧张地问道。考虑到她与 EVA 连接的困难程度，她预计同步率可能会下降 30%，甚至 40%。或许——

Her mind went blank after she heard Misato's words.  
听到美里的话后，她的思绪一片空白。

"They've decided to deactivate your pilot status. You're now held in reserve."  
“他们决定解除你的驾驶员身份。你现在被列为后备。”

AN: I'm slowing down the pace of my story a little. Sandalphon wouldn't be due in a few chapters. As for the wheelchair thing, although electric engines are common in wheelchairs nowadays, don't forget in EVA world in 2015 they didn't even have smartphones yet. Stay tuned and leave a review!  
作者注：我稍微放慢了故事的节奏。沙德尔芬不会在接下来的几章出现。至于轮椅的事情，虽然现在电动轮椅很常见，但别忘了在 EVA 世界的 2015 年，他们连智能手机都还没有。敬请期待并留下您的评论！

**Chapter 11: Microburst 第十一章：微暴流**

Shinji hadn't stopped worrying about Asuka since he left home this morning. When he left, the redhead looked like she had a lot on her mind; Shinji was tempted to ask her about it but shook it off, recalling that she'd always been like this ever since the Israfel battle. Attending school was out of the question for her considering her current condition; he really didn't want to leave her, but he had no choice.  
自从今天早上离开家后，真嗣就一直担心着明日香。他离开时，红发女孩看起来心事重重；真嗣本想问她，但又摇了摇头，想起自从伊斯拉菲尔战役以来，她一直是这样。考虑到她目前的状况，上学对她来说是不可能的；他真的不想离开她，但他别无选择。

Misato told him that Asuka was going to attend some kind of medical check today, so at least she wouldn't be alone.  
美里告诉他，明日香今天要参加某种体检，所以至少她不会孤单。

Still, he couldn't help but feel a nervous sensation haunting him, _nagging_ him.  
尽管如此，他还是忍不住感到一种紧张的情绪萦绕心头，挥之不去。

"Yo, Shin-man what's up," he was greeted by the familiar greetings he usually got when arriving at class 2-A. He smiled a weak, if not sad smile, "Hi Toji."  
“哟，真嗣，怎么了？”他一进 2-A 班，就听到了平时熟悉的招呼声。他勉强挤出一个微笑，虽然那笑容带着几分悲伤，“嗨，东治。”

"How's your weekend, Shinji?" Kensuke asked as he put his camera down. The brown-haired military otaku quickly became Shinji's close acquaintance after receiving some declassified footage of NERV operations from the pilot of EVA Unit 01. Although Shinji's primary concern wasn't socializing, having one or two friends he knew he could count on was always a good addition.  
"周末过得怎么样，真嗣？" 剑介放下相机问道。这位棕色头发的军事宅男在从 EVA 初号机驾驶员那里获得一些 NERV 行动的解密视频后，很快就成为了真嗣的密友。虽然真嗣的主要关注点并不在社交上，但拥有一两个他知道可以依靠的朋友总是一件好事。

"Not much except that my life is getting crazy with all that NERV and Asuka Misato business," Shinji let out a sigh, stretching the truth to its limit, and slumped down on his seat.  
“没什么，只是我的生活因为 NERV 和明日香美里的事变得疯狂。” 真嗣叹了口气，尽量把话说得轻描淡写，然后瘫坐在座位上。

"Too much stress from the Red Devil, huh?" Toji scoffed before a more suggestive expression appeared on his face, "I say we go to the arcade after school. Sounds good to ya?"  
“红魔女的压力太大了吧？” 冬二嗤之以鼻，随即脸上露出了更狡黠的表情，“放学后我们去游戏厅怎么样？听起来不错吧？”

"Thanks for the invitation, but-"  
“谢谢你的邀请，但是——”

"C'mon, Shin-man, you're not having fun with us recently!" Toji cut him off. "Oh let me guess, it's because of the Red Devil, isn't it? Did she get you whipped?" He winked at him smugly like a small kid who just learned a big secret.  
"拜托，真哥，你最近跟我们在一起都不开心！" 东治打断了他。"哦，让我猜猜，是因为红魔女，对吧？她把你驯服了吗？" 他得意地向他眨眼，就像一个刚学会一个大秘密的小孩。

"Drop it, will you?!" Said Shinji in exasperation. One thing he disliked about the Stooges was they always thought they knew well about people in relationships, while the truth was they didn't even know so much as the tip of the iceberg. "Sorry, but NERV business takes my priority." He executed the technically true statement, not wanting to disclose too much information that might pick up the military otaku's endless interest.  
"别说了，行不行？！" 真嗣恼怒地说。他不喜欢三傻的一点是，他们总以为自己对人际关系了如指掌，而实际上他们连冰山一角都不了解。"抱歉，但 NERV 的事务是我的首要任务。" 他执行了这个技术上真实的陈述，不想透露太多可能引起军事宅男无尽兴趣的信息。

"Yeah, yeah, you always say that."  
"是啊，是啊，你总是这么说。"

Just as Shinji was about to retort, he was cut off by the question from another person. "Ikari-kun, do you have a moment?" He turned his head in the direction of the voice and saw the class rep was looking at him oddly. "Sure, Horaki-san. What can I do for you?"  
正当真嗣准备反驳时，另一个人的问题打断了他。“碇君，你有空吗？”他循声转头，看到班长正奇怪地看着他。“当然，洞木同学。有什么我能帮忙的吗？”

"I'm worried about Asuka," she was straight to the point about it, and her concern for the girl he loved soothed Shinji's dejected mood a little bit. "She missed several days of school, I know you pilots have a lot to do at NERV, but can you at least tell me something? I heard there was an Angel attack not long ago and-"  
"我担心明日香，"她直截了当地说出了自己的担忧，她对那个他深爱的女孩的关心稍稍安抚了真嗣沮丧的心情。"她已经好几天没来学校了，我知道你们这些驾驶员在 NERV 有很多事要做，但至少能告诉我一些情况吗？我听说不久前有使徒袭击，而且——"

Shinji waved his hand, gesturing Hikari to stop talking, "I can't tell you much that without risking getting in jail, but what I can say is she's alive and whole if that's what you're worried about."  
真嗣挥了挥手，示意光停止说话，“我不能告诉你太多，否则有进监狱的风险，但我可以说的是，她活着而且完好无损，如果你担心的是这个。”

"Alive and whole? So she got injured in the battle?" Hikari went wide-eyed, her voice dripping solicitude. Knowing how dutiful the class rep was, Shinji was actually touched a little that she wasn't worried about Asuka just because it might cause trouble to her class rep obligations, but genuine concern toward the girl herself. He was happy someone else was with him on the line.  
“活着而且完好无损？那她在战斗中受伤了吗？”光睁大了眼睛，声音中充满了关切。知道班长是多么尽责的人，真嗣其实有点感动，她并不是因为担心会给自己的班长职责带来麻烦而担心明日香，而是出于对那个女孩本身的真切关怀。他很高兴有人和他站在同一立场上。

Still, Shinji sighed in dismissal, "I'm really not sure how much I can tell you, Horaki-san," suddenly an idea struck him. "Actually, I think you can call her if you want."  
尽管如此，真嗣还是叹了口气，表示拒绝，“我真的不确定能告诉你多少，堀崎同学，”突然一个念头闪过他的脑海。“实际上，如果你想的话，你可以给她打电话。”

"Great!" Hikari exclaimed in joyfulness, "thanks, I-"  
“太好了！”光兴奋地喊道，“谢谢，我——”

Their conversation was interrupted as Sensei came in; the class rep wasted no time to change into her professional mode, "Rise! Bow! Sit!"  
他们的对话被老师打断；班长毫不犹豫地切换到专业模式，“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”

Shinji shook his head as Sensei continued to drown on about pre-impact life. He could already feel today was going to be a long day.  
老师继续滔滔不绝地讲述着前冲击时代的生活，真嗣摇了摇头。他已经感觉到今天将会是漫长的一天。

Misato watched intently in apprehension as several female technicians pulled the limp girl out of the entry plug. Asuka hadn't even said a word after the announcement, let alone actively coordinate with people helping her. Instead, she just kept staring out at empty space, not so much as blinking.  
美里紧张地注视着，几位女技术人员将瘫软的女孩从插入栓中拉出。自宣布以来，明日香连一句话都没说，更别提主动配合帮助她的人了。她只是不停地凝视着空荡荡的空间，连眨眼都几乎没有。

"This is a bad idea…" Misato muttered to herself in irritation, "I told you so! Look what she turned into! Like a…a zombie!" She raised her volume, yelling at the faux blonde standing beside her.  
"这主意糟透了……" 美里烦躁地自言自语，"我早就说过！看她变成了什么样子！像个……僵尸一样！" 她提高了音量，对着站在一旁的假金发女郎大喊。

"We've had this discussion before, and I'm not repeating my arguments." Ritsuko replied nonchalantly, not wavering the slightest, "Still, I will try to find ways to cure her." She didn't really care about the Second Child on a personal level; if anything, she was doing it out of a sense of duty, as well as her own curiosity. "By the way, I think we need to quickly find another pilot. We don't know when the next Angel would attack."  
"我们之前已经讨论过这个问题，我不想重复我的论点。" 律子淡然回应，丝毫未动摇，"不过，我会设法找到治愈她的方法。" 她对二号驾驶员并没有个人层面的关心；如果有什么，她这么做是出于责任感，以及她自己的好奇心。"顺便说一句，我认为我们需要尽快找到另一个驾驶员。我们不知道下一次使徒何时会袭击。"

Misato made no remarks and shot her college friend a dirty glare before walking to Asuka's side, who was already put in her wheelchair and still unresponsive. Seeing Asuka not moving at all, Misato sighed and started pushing the wheelchair by herself. She still had paperwork to do, but she couldn't trust Section 2 to take good care of the poor girl.  
美里没有发表评论，只是狠狠地瞪了大学同学一眼，然后走向已经坐在轮椅上、仍然毫无反应的明日香。看到明日香一动不动，美里叹了口气，开始自己推着轮椅。她还有文书工作要做，但她无法信任第二课好好照顾这个可怜的女孩。

It hurt her a lot when Misato tried to get Asuka into her RA130 – the said girl didn't so much as acknowledge her presence, nor coordinating with her actions. This wasn't the proud girl she mothered several years ago in Germany; now she was a total walking-dead, waiting for the world to just forget about her pathetic existence.  
每当美里试图让明日香进入她的 RA130 时，那种痛苦尤为深刻——那个女孩不仅没有承认她的存在，连行动上也没有与她协调。这不再是她在德国抚养了多年的那个骄傲女孩；如今她宛如一具行尸走肉，等待着世界遗忘她那可悲的存在。

Although Asuka was still wearing her LCL-drenched plugsuit, Misato didn't mind putting her on the passenger's seat; this way, she could more conveniently check on her condition and make sure she's okay. Neither of the two occupants of the vehicle said a word the entire way home. In Misato's case she simply didn't know what to say, not to mention even if she said anything she didn't expect to get any form of response.  
尽管明日香仍穿着那件浸透 LCL 的插入栓服，美里并不介意让她坐在副驾驶座上；这样，她可以更方便地检查她的状况并确保她没事。回家的路上，车内的两人都一言不发。对美里来说，她根本不知道该说什么，更不用说即便她说了什么，也不指望能得到任何形式的回应。

"Asuka, do you need something?" Misato finally started as she settled Asuka on her bed and turned on the light.  
“明日香，你需要什么吗？”美里终于开口，当她把明日香安顿在床上并打开灯时。

"I need some sleep…" At last, a barely audible whisper could be heard by Misato, who was undoubtedly getting impatient. A quick glance at the clock told her the school was already over; thus she replied softly, "Alright. Shinji will be home in a minute and he'll take care of you. I'm sorry but I still have work to do at NERV HQ, so behave until he gets home, okay?" One thing she found reliable about Shinji was his punctuality.  
"我需要睡一会儿……" 终于，一个几乎听不见的低语传入了美里耳中，她无疑已经等得不耐烦了。她迅速瞥了一眼时钟，得知学校已经放学；于是她轻声回答："好的。真嗣马上就回家了，他会照顾你的。对不起，但我还得回 NERV 总部工作，所以在他回来之前乖乖的，好吗？" 她对真嗣的守时一向很有信心。

Asuka looked like she wanted to say something, but after several long seconds of silence, she simply nodded slightly. Misato sighed sadly, "good." She put down a cellphone beside her pillow, "call me or Section 2 if you need anything, alright?" The only confirmation she got was another slight nod. She sighed again, "see you later, then."  
明日香看起来想说些什么，但在长时间的沉默后，她只是微微点了点头。美里难过地叹了口气，"好。" 她把一部手机放在她的枕边，"有事就给我或第二课打电话，好吗？" 她得到的唯一回应是又一次轻微的点头。她再次叹息，"那，待会儿见。"

Misato switched off the light and warily slid the door close. Nonetheless, she still made sure Asuka fell asleep first before heading to the front door and left the apartment. She really didn't want to leave her alone in the home like this; but her paperwork accumulated these days was building up the pressure, adding that Ritsuko demanded her to go back as soon as possible, and it's not like Asuka could go anywhere by herself.  
美里关掉灯，小心翼翼地拉上门。尽管如此，她还是确保明日香先睡着，然后才走向前门离开公寓。她真的不想让她一个人待在家里；但这些天积压的文件正增加压力，加上律子要求她尽快回去，而且明日香也不可能自己出门。

Shinji's going to be back home very soon, anyway.  
不管怎样，真嗣很快就会回家了。

If there was ever a time when Shinji missed having Misato or Kaji driving, today was the time. The ride to the Geofront was painfully long; As Shinji waited impatiently in the public transport system, for some unspoken reason, his eyelid kept twitching all the way there, including the dozens of minutes train ride from the surface to NERV HQ.  
如果真嗣曾经想念过美里或加持开车的时候，那今天就是这样的时刻。前往地底都市的旅程漫长而痛苦；真嗣在公共交通系统中不耐烦地等待着，不知为何，他的眼皮一路上都在跳动，包括从地面到 NERV 总部的那几十分钟火车行程。

As Shinji ran past the vast land that's Geofront, he came across a familiar planting ground; his lips curled up a little as he sighted a certain hunky man. Maybe he could ask Kaji about her first…  
当真嗣跑过广阔的地底都市时，他经过了一片熟悉的种植地；当他看到某个魁梧的男人时，嘴角微微上扬。也许他可以先向加持打听一下她的情况……

"Hello, Kaji-san," he greeted; after the said man turned his head in his direction and put down the hose, he continued, "I never did take you for the gardening type."  
"你好，加治先生，"他打招呼道；在对方转过头来放下水管后，他继续说，"我从未想过你会是喜欢园艺的人。"

"Well, everyone needs a hobby." He shrugged, sprinkling one last batch of melons before cutting the pressure. "I appreciate you want to chat with me. I have to admit it does get a little bit lonely being out here all by myself sometimes."  
"嗯，每个人都有自己的爱好。"他耸耸肩，洒完最后一批瓜果后关掉了水压。"我很高兴你想和我聊天。我得承认，有时候一个人在这里确实有点孤单。"

Shinji chuckled, "why don't you invite Misato-san, then?"  
真嗣笑了笑，"那你为什么不邀请美里小姐呢？"

Kaji blinked in surprise. Were Kids now all so perceptive? Or was he being too obvious? "Well, taking interests in my personal life, eh Shinji?"  
加持眨了眨眼，感到惊讶。现在的孩子们都这么敏锐吗？还是他自己表现得太过明显了？“好吧，对我个人生活感兴趣了，嗯，真嗣？”

"It's not that, it's just…" Shinji's expression turned ponderous. In almost every cycle he went through, he would try to connect with other people other than Asuka, as well as help other people to connect with each other, Kaji and Misato being on the top of his priority list.  
“不是那样的，只是……”真嗣的表情变得沉思起来。在几乎每一个循环中，他都会尝试与其他人建立联系，不仅仅是与明日香，还会帮助其他人相互联系，加持和美里是他优先考虑的对象。

He learned it the hard way.  
他是通过艰难的方式学会的。

That one time, he got tired and didn't care about anyone but Asuka, in the end Kaji got killed, Misato abandoned him for her own revenge, and Rei chose Gendo instead of him.  
那一次，他累了，只在乎明日香，结果加持被杀，美里为了复仇抛弃了他，而绫波选择了碇司令而不是他。

_"I thought better of you…" Asuka's voice trembled in rage, "what a disappointment… you're disgusting, THIRD! DISGUSTING!"  
“我本以为你更好…”明日香的声音因愤怒而颤抖，“真让人失望…你真恶心，第三！恶心透顶！”_

"It's just I know she's lonely, and I care about her," Shinji finally spoke, eliciting another surprised look from the spy who was trained for controlling emotions.  
“只是我知道她很孤独，我在乎她，”真嗣终于开口，让那位受过情绪控制训练的间谍再次露出惊讶的表情。

"You say that as if you understand her well, Shinji-kun," Kaji let out a sigh disguised as a chuckle, "but the truth is people can never understand each other completely, and that's why we spend so much time trying. Maybe you will, after centuries and centuries of time…"  
"你说得好像你很了解她似的，真嗣君，" 加持发出一声叹息，伪装成轻笑，"但事实是，人们永远无法完全理解彼此，这就是为什么我们花费这么多时间去尝试。也许经过几百年的时间，你会理解的……"

Shinji barely held back a laugh, _'you don't know how right you are, Kaji-san. I almost wish you know.'_ "Kaji-san, you won't know how much you're alike until you start talking. She can be just as lonely as you, but she never let you know."  
真嗣勉强忍住笑意，'你说得一点没错，加持先生。我几乎希望你了解。' '加持先生，你不知道你们有多相似，直到你们开始交谈。她可以和你一样孤独，但她从不让你知道。'

Kaji blinked again. Did Shinji just…gave him advice on relationships? "Oh? Have you met your own 'Katsuragi', Shinji-kun?" He diverted the subject, fearing what that route could lead into.  
"加持再次眨眼。真嗣刚刚是……在给他感情上的建议吗？"哦？你遇到自己的'葛城'了吗，真嗣君？" 他转移了话题，担心那条路会引向何方。

"Yes," Shinji smiled a distant smile, carrying a hint of sadness in it, "There was one person…she pushed me like no one else. She meant everything she said, while at the same time she didn't. She was like fire on the outside, but she also had a heart made of glass that she would never show anyone. She was my anchor to reality. She…was the one in my life."  
“是的，”真嗣带着一丝遥远的微笑，其中隐含着悲伤，“有一个人……她对我的推动无人能及。她说的每一句话都发自内心，同时又并非如此。她外表如火，内心却有一颗玻璃般的心，从不向任何人展示。她是我在现实中的锚。她……是我生命中的那个人。”

Kaji's raised an eyebrow since he felt his initial assumption that Shinji was in love with Asuka didn't seem to hold water anymore. His descriptions could only lead to one person, at least among people he knew. But the way Shinji articulated it…  
加持扬起眉毛，因为他觉得他最初认为真嗣爱上了明日香的假设似乎站不住脚了。他的描述只能指向一个人，至少在他认识的人中。但真嗣表达的方式……

On second thought, Kaji could feel tightness growing inside his chest. Why Shinji, a fourteen years old child, could have something as deep and beautiful as what he described? Why couldn't _he_ have it?  
转念一想，加持感到胸口紧绷。为什么真嗣，一个十四岁的孩子，能拥有如此深沉而美好的东西？为什么他不能拥有？

"Oh? What happened to-" Kaji blurted out without his brain processing the words, and immediately regrated saying them as he saw the twitch on Shinji's face.  
"哦？发生了什么——" 加持脱口而出，话未经过大脑，随即就后悔了，因为他看到真嗣脸上的抽搐。

"I lost her, Kaji-san." "我失去了她，加持先生。"

"I'm…sorry to hear that," Kaji grimaced, silently cursing at his carelessness.  
"我……很遗憾听到这个消息，" 加持皱起眉头，暗自咒骂自己的粗心大意。

"It's okay," Shinji smiled sadly, shaking his head. "I'm still trying to compensate…for how much I hurt her, how much I failed her." He threw out the smokescreen, not wanting to disclose too much information, but his words had already put the trained spy in a state of shock. "Anyways, do you know how Asuka's doing?"  
"没事的，" 真嗣苦笑着摇头，"我还在努力弥补……我伤她有多深，我让她失望了多少。" 他抛出了烟幕弹，不想透露太多信息，但他的话已经让这位训练有素的间谍震惊不已。"总之，你知道明日香现在怎么样了吗？"

"I thought you should know her better than me," Kaji grinned smugly, "it's your job to take care of her, after all."  
"我以为你对她的了解比我深，" 加持得意地笑了，"毕竟，照顾她是你的职责。"

"Well, yeah, but I went to school today and she's with Misato," Shinji said, "speaking of whom, I think we need a couch in the apartment. This way, she can watch some TV instead of lying on her bed all day long."  
"嗯，是啊，但我今天去了学校，她跟美里在一起，" 真嗣说，"说到这个，我觉得我们公寓需要一张沙发。这样，她可以看看电视，而不是整天躺在床上。"

Kaji chuckled, "you're a considerate man, Shinji-kun. Anyway, I believe she had a sync test today…"  
加持轻笑道，“你真是个体贴的人，真嗣君。对了，我想她今天有个同步测试……”

"WHAT?!" Shinji cried with his eyes went wide, his voice disturbing a flock of birds resting on a tree nearby. "Sync test?! I thought it's just a medical check!"  
“什么？！”真嗣惊呼，眼睛瞪得溜圆，他的声音惊扰了一群在附近树上歇息的鸟儿。“同步测试？！我以为只是个体检！”

"Huh? No one told you about it?" Kaji frowned at his outburst, "what's wrong?"  
“嗯？没人告诉你吗？”加持对他的爆发皱起眉头，“怎么了？”

"What's the result? What's the result?!" Shinji clenched his fists tightly, "please tell me, Ka-" He trailed off as another familiar female voice called out to him, "Shinji? What're you doing here?"  
"结果是什么？结果是什么？！" 真嗣紧握双拳，"请告诉我，香-" 他话音未落，另一个熟悉的女声呼唤着他，"真嗣？你在这里做什么？"

He turned his head in the direction, finding a uniform-wearing Misato Katsuragi standing not so distant away from them. "Misato-san! Why didn't you tell me Asuka's having a sync test today?!"  
他转向声音的方向，发现穿着制服的葛城美里站在不远处。"美里小姐！你为什么不告诉我明日香今天要进行同步测试？！"

Misato smiled an apologetic smile, "Asuka demanded me not to tell you…speaking of which, why are you here? I thought you should be at home!"  
美里带着歉意的微笑，"明日香要求我不告诉你……话说回来，你为什么在这里？我以为你应该在家！"

"I came here to check on Asuka!" Shinji hastily said, "where is she?"  
"我来这里是为了看看明日香！" 真嗣急忙说道，"她在哪儿？"

"She's at home, I left her because I thought you'd be there very soon. Fuck," Misato cursed in irritation toward herself, "It's been almost an hour…I hope she's okay being alone at home."  
"她在家，我离开她是因为我觉得你很快就会到那儿。该死，" 美里懊恼地咒骂自己，"已经快一个小时了……希望她一个人在家没事。"

"Seriously Misato, you left Asuka, who's crippled, alone at home?!" Shinji shouted incredulously. Hearing Misato stammered several apologies, he shook his head in exasperation. Even though she really cared about her charge, Misato had never been a good guardian in a technical sense. "Anyway, what's the result of the sync test?"  
"说真的，美里，你把一个行动不便的明日香一个人留在家里了？！" 真嗣难以置信地喊道。听到美里结结巴巴地道歉，他无奈地摇了摇头。尽管她真的很关心她的监护对象，但从技术角度来看，美里从来就不是一个称职的监护人。"不管怎样，同步测试的结果怎么样？"

"Erm, they've decided to pull her out of the EVA…"  
“呃，他们决定把她从 EVA 中撤出来…”

_No…_

Shinji felt his blood turn to ice.  
真嗣感到血液仿佛凝固了。

"MISATO, DRIVE US HOME, NOW!"  
"美里，现在就开车送我们回家！"

No one noticed the phone in Kaji's cabin that started to ring.  
没有人注意到片舱里的电话开始响了起来。

_'I'm fucking useless…'_ was the thought that had been lingering in Asuka's mind ever since her life-without-EVA sentence. She kept staring at the ceiling, her spirit deteriorating with each passing second. Sleep wouldn't come again after the bad dream she had twenty minutes ago. Instead of the usual staring at her mom hanging on the ceiling, this time it was her mother morphed into EVA Unit 02 which wielded a prog knife, chasing her, hunting her, and she couldn't even run away – she didn't have working legs.  
'我真是没用……'自从被判终身不得驾驶 EVA 后，这个念头就一直萦绕在明日香的心头。她不停地盯着天花板，每过一秒，她的精神就更加萎靡。二十分钟前那个噩梦之后，她再也睡不着了。这次不再是通常那样盯着挂在天花板上的妈妈，而是她的母亲变成了 EVA 二号机，手持着一把程序刀，追逐她，猎杀她，而她甚至无法逃跑——她没有能用的腿。

Her brooding was interrupted by a bout of phone ringer. Asuka picked up her phone; her face momentarily lit up as she recognized the number as Hikari's.  
她的沉思被一阵电话铃声打断。明日香拿起手机；当她认出是光打来的号码时，脸上瞬间亮了起来。

"Hello? Hikari?" Asuka whispered weakly into the microphone, carrying a hint of hope.  
“喂？光吗？”明日香微弱地对着麦克风低语，带着一丝希望。

"Asuka!" Hikari's cheerful voice came through the speaker, her voice hissing due to electronic interference. "How are you?"  
“明日香！”光那欢快的声音从扬声器中传来，由于电子干扰，声音有些嘶嘶作响。“你还好吗？”

"I'm…not fine," Asuka finally said in a shaky voice.  
"我……不太好，" 明日香终于用颤抖的声音说道。

"Oh my God! Are you okay? What happened? Was it because of an Angel?"  
"哦，天哪！你还好吗？发生了什么？是因为使徒吗？"

Asuka felt her stomach twist as she was reminded of her disastrous failure. "Yeah…"  
明日香感到胃部一阵绞痛，她再次想起了自己那灾难性的失败。"嗯……"

"I feel bad for you…"  
"我为你感到难过……"

_No. I don't want pity.  
不，我不需要怜悯。_

"I'm sure you did your best…"  
"我相信你已经尽力了……"

_So my best was 'getting utterly destroyed and lost my legs'?  
所以我的最好表现就是‘被彻底击败并失去了双腿’？_

"So, you're not coming to school in a few days, right? I have to change the cleaning schedule…"  
“所以，你这几天不来学校了，对吧？我得调整清洁计划……”

_Right. Of course she cared more about her duties.  
没错。她当然更关心她的职责。_

"We'll talk later, okay?" At this point Asuka was already in a state mixed with bitterness, anger, and sadness. She was nothing. Even her best friend in school abandoned her.  
“我们晚点再谈，好吗？”此时，绫波的心情已是苦涩、愤怒与悲伤交织。她感到自己一无所有。就连学校里最好的朋友也抛弃了她。

The phone hung up. Suddenly Asuka screamed, and tried to throw the phone on the wall with her might. She stopped mid-action – there was still one person she could try to contact.  
电话挂断了。突然，绫波尖叫起来，试图用尽全力将手机砸向墙壁。但在半途中她停住了——还有一个人她可以尝试联系。

Asuka entered Kaji's number and dialed. The phone started to ring as she held it tightly like a life-saving straw.  
绫波输入了加持的号码并拨通。电话开始响铃，她紧紧握住手机，仿佛抓住了一根救命稻草。

_Du…Du…Du…Hi this is Ryoji Kaji, Sorry I'm busy right now. Leave a voice mail after 'Di'!…Di…  
嘟…嘟…嘟…嗨，我是碇カジ，很抱歉我现在正忙。请在‘哔’声后留言！…哔…_

Asuka hung up and tried again. Still no reply came. And again. Again.  
明日香挂断电话，再次尝试。依然没有回应。她又试了一次，又一次。

After the fifth attempt, she couldn't take it anymore. Asuka viciously threw the phone on the wall, shattering it into pieces of plastic and circuit boards. Under the extreme state of rage she tried to stand up and destroy everything in vicinity, but miserably failed as she slammed hard on the floor. The disabled redhead lay on the floor for a while, panting heavily, a turmoil of thoughts stormed her mind.  
第五次尝试后，她再也忍受不了了。明日香恶狠狠地将手机砸向墙壁，手机碎成了塑料和电路板的碎片。在极度愤怒的状态下，她试图站起来摧毁周围的一切，却悲惨地重重摔在了地板上。这位残疾的红发少女躺在地上，喘着粗气，脑海中思绪翻涌。

_"Home is not a place, Asuka. There are people who care about you. Me, Misato-san, Kaji-san, and your friend at school, the class rep, we all care about you. So I don't want to hear you say that ever again."  
“家不是一个地方，明日香。有那些关心你的人在。我，美里小姐，加持先生，还有你在学校的同学，班长，我们都关心你。所以我不希望再听到你说那样的话。”_

Asuka sneered as she recalled Shinji's words, which now sounded like a complete joke to her. Misato cared about her? Then why did she leave her for her paperwork and never came back? Did kaji care about her? Then why wouldn't he pick up her phone, not to mention he could never give her what she wanted from him? Hikari cared about her? No, she only cared about her idiotic duties, and she was a friend to the elite-pilot Asuka who's on the top of social ladders, not the sad and lonely little girl who couldn't even get up from the bed by herself.  
明日香回想起真嗣的话，现在听起来完全像个笑话。美里关心她？那为什么她为了工作丢下她，再也没有回来？加持关心她？那为什么他不接电话，更别说他永远无法给她想要的？光关心她？不，她只在乎她那愚蠢的职责，她是精英驾驶员明日香的朋友，站在社交顶端的人，而不是那个悲伤孤独、连起床都做不到的小女孩。

Did Shinji care about her?  
真嗣关心她吗？

Misato said he would come home soon…but it's been almost an hour and he's still nowhere to be seen…  
美里说他很快就会回家……但已经过去快一个小时了，他还是不见踪影……

Asuka let out a bout of maniac laughter. Shinji cared about her being a pilot who could help in battles; Now, it all made sense to Asuka. Shinji took care of her definitely because he wanted her able to pilot as soon as possible so he could have a helping hand when fighting the Angels.  
明日香发出一阵狂笑。真嗣关心她是因为她是一名能在战斗中提供帮助的驾驶员；现在，一切都对明日香说得通了。真嗣照顾她肯定是因为他想让她尽快恢复驾驶能力，这样在对抗使徒时他就能有个帮手。

Now he must've learned that she wasn't even a pilot anymore, it's only natural for him to dump her like a piece of trash.  
现在他一定已经知道她连驾驶员都不是了，他会像丢垃圾一样抛弃她也是理所当然的。

Why would anyone care about her, a broken tool at best, a chunk of dirt in the sewer at worst?  
为何会有人在意她，充其量不过是个破损的工具，最坏也不过是下水道里的一块污泥？

"I'm a piece of trash… I'm nothing… I'm fucking useless…" Screaming, Asuka repeatedly slammed her fist hard on the ground; under the powerful strikes, the wooden floor bent inward at where her knuckles hit. Blood dripped from the wounds on her hands, but she couldn't care less.  
“我是一块垃圾…我什么都不是…我他妈一无是处…”明日香尖叫着，一次次用力捶打地面；在她的重击下，木质地板在她拳头的撞击处凹陷了进去。血从她手上的伤口滴落，但她毫不在意。

Not qualified to be the Second Child…no one would look at her…everyone had abandoned her.  
不配成为二号机驾驶员…没人会看她一眼…所有人都抛弃了她。

Then why was she still existing?  
那她为何还存在？

She tried to use her desk to stand up again, but her limp legs wouldn't move. _'Yeah, and I'm crippled…permanently. Why am I still alive?'_ With a final twisted shriek, Asuka grabbed the legs of her desk, throwing the table away, sending the contents on it flying around in her bedroom.  
她试图再次借助桌子站起来，但无力的双腿动弹不得。'是啊，我残废了……永久性的。我为什么还活着？' 随着最后一声扭曲的尖叫，明日香抓住桌腿，猛地将桌子掀翻，桌上的物品四处飞散在她的卧室里。

Asuka's eyes then settled on the shining small metal object that fell to the floor. A look of resolve crossed her face.  
明日香的目光随后落在掉落在地上的闪亮小金属物体上。她的脸上闪过一丝决意。

It was a fruit knife.  
那是一把水果刀。

AN: Ahem the couch reference hahaha. Anyways, Misato didn't help her in canon when Asuka was in depression as well, so I thought this wouldn't be too much of an OOC. Stay tuned and leave a review!  
AN: 咳咳，关于沙发的那个梗哈哈哈。话说回来，在原作中 Misato 并没有在 Asuka 抑郁时帮助她，所以我觉得这样应该不会太 OOC。敬请期待，并留下你的评论吧！

**Chapter 12: Cold Front 第十二章：寒流来袭**

_'Please, please don't let it be too late…'_ Only one thought remained in his mind as Shinji rode Misato's speeding RA130 to Katsuragi Residence. Misato, being surprised at Shinji's sudden outburst, wanted to ask why he was so urgent. However, after she saw the look on Shinji's face at that time – stern and cold, reminding her of his father – she decided whatever it was, she could ask him about it later.  
‘求求你，千万不要太迟了……’真嗣骑着美里那辆疾驰的 RA130 赶往葛城宅，心中只剩下这一个念头。美里对真嗣突如其来的急迫感到惊讶，想问他为何如此紧急。然而，当她看到真嗣当时的表情——严肃而冷酷，让她想起了他的父亲——她决定无论是什么事，都可以稍后再问。

Shinji almost wished he could drive the car by himself, but the problem was he didn't have the chance to learn to drive _properly_ in all of his former cycles. He wanted to laugh at the fact that the Japanese government trusted him enough to let him pilot a multi-billion dollar ultimate war machine that could wipe out an entire city block in minutes but not something everyone else was driving simply because he wasn't old enough, while Shinji himself had already lost track of his actual age.  
真嗣几乎希望自己能独自驾驶这辆车，但问题是他在之前的所有循环中都没有机会正经学过开车。他觉得好笑，日本政府信任他到让他驾驶一台价值数十亿、几分钟内就能摧毁整个街区的终极战争机器，却因为他未成年而不允许他做其他人都在做的事。而真嗣自己早已记不清自己的实际年龄了。

Even though Misato summoned all of her driving techniques to dodge the traffic and find shortcuts, breaking at least seven traffic laws in the process at a speed of almost twice the speed limit, Shinji still wanted her to go faster.  
尽管美里使出了浑身解数，巧妙地避开车流、寻找捷径，过程中至少违反了七项交通法规，车速几乎达到了限速的两倍，但真嗣仍希望她能再快一些。

Because he knew he might be racing with the death.  
因为他知道，自己可能正在与死神赛跑。

Last time when she was stripped away from the Evangelion project while he wasn't there to help her, he was late to the site by several minutes – after she exhaled one last breath.  
上次她被排除在 EVA 项目之外时，他未能及时赶到帮助她，他迟到了几分钟——就在她呼出最后一口气之后。

"Kaji-san, what's Section 2 telling us?!" Shinji asked anxiously, hoping that Section 2 could actually be helpful this one time.  
“加持先生，第二课在说什么？！”真嗣焦急地问道，希望第二课这次能真正帮上忙。

"They got no responses from inside the apartment," the special inspector replied. "They don't have keys to go inside, nor do they have…weapons to forcibly open the door."  
“他们没有收到公寓内的回应，”特别检查官回答，“他们没有钥匙进去，也没有……武器强行开门。”

Shinji silently cursed, wondering why Section 2 had always been useless whenever he needed them. With an elegant drift the blue car turned to the road leading to their apartment complex; Shinji jumped out of the car even before it completely halted, rushing to the elevator, not waiting for the two adults at all. _'Come on, come on…'_ The elevator arrived on the seventh floor; Shinji dashed out of the cab, heading to the apartment as fast as he could, and slid the keycard through the slot on the electronic lock. With a hiss the door opened, allowing the anxious boy to rush inside.  
真嗣默默咒骂着，不明白为什么每当他需要第二课的时候，他们总是那么无能。蓝色轿车优雅地漂移，转向通往他们公寓大楼的道路；真嗣甚至在车完全停稳之前就跳了出来，冲向电梯，完全没有等待两位成年人的意思。'快点，快点……'电梯到达了七楼；真嗣冲出电梯，尽可能快地朝公寓跑去，将钥匙卡滑过电子锁的插槽。随着一声嘶响，门打开了，让焦急的男孩冲了进去。

The apartment was empty, which was to be expected. "Asuka!" He called out, but received no replies whatsoever before sprinting toward her bedroom. "WARK!" Pen Pen stood before Asuka's bedroom door, pointing one of his wings at the door, his expression in penguin-equivalent nervousness. Didn't so much as bothering knocking, Asuka's bedroom door was thrown open by a forceful pull from Shinji.  
公寓空无一人，这在意料之中。“明日香！”他喊道，但没有得到任何回应，便冲向她的卧室。“哇克！”Pen Pen 站在明日香卧室门前，用一只翅膀指向门，表情显得相当紧张。他甚至没敲门，明日香的卧室门就被真嗣用力拉开。

He felt his blood running cold as he sighted blotches of blood that stained the floor.  
他看到地板上沾染的血迹，感到血液都凝固了。

_No…Asuka… 不……明日香……_

"ASUKA!" Shinji cried out desperately in grief, his eyes scanned around the room, trying to locate the girl he loved. The sky outside the window was covered in thick overcast cumulus, the dim light of the sun that pierced through it shimmered in the dusky room. He gasped as his eyes settled on the slender form of the redhead, who had her back pressed against the wall, holding a small fruit knife in her right hand, the sharp edge of the blade placed at her wrist.  
“明日香！”真嗣绝望地哭喊着，他的眼睛四处扫视，试图找到他心爱的女孩。窗外天空被厚厚的积云覆盖，透过云层的微弱阳光在昏暗的房间里闪烁。当他看到红发女孩纤细的身影时，他倒吸了一口气，她背靠着墙，右手握着一把小水果刀，锋利的刀刃抵在她的手腕上。

The girl raised her head, locking her bright blue eyes with his cobalt ones, her expression mixed with bewilderment and surprise.  
女孩抬起头，她明亮的蓝眼睛与他的钴蓝色眼睛对视，表情中混杂着困惑和惊讶。

Shinji felt his knees wobble after he double-checked that the blood came out from her knuckles, not her wrist. Still the danger wasn't eliminated. He quickly recomposed himself and said calmly, "Asuka, put down the knife." He didn't come closer to her, dreading that one wrong step it would all be over.  
碇真嗣再次确认那血是从她的指关节流出而非手腕后，感到膝盖一阵发软。尽管危险并未完全消除，他迅速调整状态，平静地说道：“明日香，放下刀。”他没有靠近她，唯恐一步走错，一切都将无法挽回。

Asuka looked down at the knife and smiled a smile mixed with sadness and weakness. "Just let me die Shinji, I have nothing else in this world…" Saying, she started applying pressure on her wrist with the knife. "Goodbye, Shin-AHHH!"  
明日香低头看着刀，露出了一个混合着悲伤与虚弱的微笑。“就让我死吧，真嗣，我在这个世界上已一无所有……”说着，她开始用刀在手腕上施加压力。“再见，真——啊！”

In blinking speed Shinji mustered all of his strength and leaped forward, pushing the defenseless redhead down onto the floor. With a calculated precision kick, the knife was sent flying away across the bedroom, landing at the far corner. Asuka struggled under his body, trying to push him off using her arms, but to no avail without working legs. "You let me go, Shinji!" She screamed, "No one needs me! No one needs a pilot who couldn't sync with her EVA!" A tear rolled down her face. "Even you don't need me anymore…" She added in a weaker whisper, her voice filled with pain and sorrow.  
在眨眼间，碇真嗣用尽全力向前一跃，将毫无防备的红发少女推倒在地板上。他以精确计算的一脚将刀踢飞至卧室的远角。明日香在他身下挣扎，试图用双臂推开他，但失去双腿的支撑，她无能为力。“放开我，真嗣！”她尖叫道，“没有人需要我！没有人需要一个无法与 EVA 同步的驾驶员！”一滴泪水滑过她的脸颊。“甚至你也不再需要我了……”她以更微弱的声音补充道，声音中充满了痛苦与哀伤。

"NO!" Shinji shouted, silencing the redhead in an instant. "Don't say we don't need you anymore Asuka!"  
“不！”真嗣大喊一声，立刻让红发女孩闭上了嘴。“别再说我们不再需要你了，明日香！”

"But I can no longer pilot!" She resumed screaming, "I got defeated by the Angel two times… I'm crippled…and I'm not even a pilot anymore! Then what good am I?!"  
"但我再也不能驾驶了！" 她继续尖叫，"我被使徒击败了两次……我残废了……我甚至不再是驾驶员了！那我还有什么用？！"

"You're many things other than an Evangelion pilot, Asuka," Shinji responded calmly. "You're still the brilliant girl who completed a college degree at the age of thirteen, the courageous person who saved my life in battle once, and the prettiest girl in our school, even in entire Tokyo-3! I care about you, Asuka!"  
"除了 EVA 驾驶员，你还有很多身份，明日香，" 真嗣平静地回应，"你依然是那个十三岁就完成大学学位的聪明女孩，那个在战斗中救过我一命的勇敢之人，以及我们学校，甚至是整个东京-3 最漂亮的女孩！我在乎你，明日香！"

Asuka remained silent for several seconds before speaking up, "you…think I'm the prettiest girl in Tokyo-3?"  
明日香沉默了几秒钟后开口，"你……觉得我是东京-3 最漂亮的女孩？"

Shinji blinked. "Of course," he replied, knowing the disastrous outcome if he dared to say anything else.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“当然，”他回答道，深知如果再敢多说些什么，后果将不堪设想。

Asuka chuckled disguised as a sob, "but all that…was gone." She sulked. "Shinji…why aren't you running away?! All I do is causing you trouble! I can't do anything by myself! Why do you still care?!"  
明日香以假装的抽泣掩饰着轻笑，“但那些……都已不复存在了。”她沮丧地说道，“真嗣……你为什么不逃走呢？！我所做的只会给你带来麻烦！我什么都做不了！你为什么还要在乎我？！”

"Because…" Shinji pondered for a moment. What could he say? What _should_ he say? "Because…I ran away once when people needed me the most, and it cost me a lot…" he paused for a moment, organizing his language. "Especially there was one girl, when she needed my help the most I just sat there doing nothing. I left her alone," he could feel Asuka's body tensing up at the mention of another girl, but he decided to continue. "then I lost her forever…after that, I promised myself that I would never run away ever again." He really didn't want to tell her anything about his past lives since it would only bring unnecessary problems, but Shinji also knew right now there's no other way.  
"因为…" 真嗣沉思片刻。他该说什么？应该说什么？"因为…我曾经在人们最需要我的时候逃跑了，这让我付出了很大的代价…" 他停顿了一下，整理着语言。"特别是有一个女孩，在她最需要我帮助的时候，我却只是坐在那里什么都没做。我让她独自一人，" 他能感觉到提到另一个女孩时，明日香的身子紧绷起来，但他决定继续说下去。"然后我永远失去了她…从那以后，我发誓我再也不会逃跑。" 他真的不想告诉她关于自己前世的任何事情，因为那只会带来不必要的麻烦，但真嗣也知道现在没有其他办法。

"So I'm just her replacement?" Asuka questioned threateningly. From the sharpness in her voice Shinji suspected she wanted to cut him open and see all of his secrets. "Like your second chance to make everything right?"  
"所以我就只是她的替代品？" 明日香威胁性地问道。从她尖锐的语气中，真嗣怀疑她想把他剖开，看看他所有的秘密。"就像是你第二次机会来弥补一切？"

"No, Asuka," Shinji replied with a slight frown, even though in a way she wasn't wrong. "You're…well, Asuka Langley Soryu, you're yourself, not anyone's replacement, nor will you ever be." Even an earthquake couldn't move the firmness in his voice.  
"不，明日香，" 真嗣微微皱眉回答，尽管在某种程度上她并没有错。"你是…嗯，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你是你自己，不是任何人的替代品，也永远不会是。" 即使地震也无法动摇他声音中的坚定。

Asuka huffed half-believingly, "then who am I to you?"  
明日香半信半疑地哼了一声，“那我对你来说算什么？”

"Personally you're my friend, Asuka," Shinji's tone softened by a few degrees, contrasted by the determination in his eyes.  
“就个人而言，你是我的朋友，明日香，”真嗣的语气柔和了几分，与眼中坚定的决心形成对比。

"Friend…" Asuka sneered before raising her volume, "why do you need a friend so useless like me? Useless, I'm fucking use-"  
“朋友……”明日香嗤之以鼻，随即提高了音量，“你为什么需要像我这样没用的朋友？没用，我他妈的就是个——”

Asuka was silenced instantly as she felt a sudden warmth overtake her. She could feel two limbs wrapping around her and a soft ruffling sensation on the side of her tearstained cheek. She slowly rose her head up and looked around her to see that Shinji had wrapped her in a tight embrace.  
明日香顿时哑然，一股突如其来的温暖笼罩了她。她能感觉到两条手臂环绕着自己，泪痕斑斑的脸颊旁传来轻柔的摩挲感。她缓缓抬起头，环顾四周，发现真嗣紧紧地拥抱着她。

At first she was horrified by this, trying to push him away and squirm out of his grip. But every time she tried to free herself, his grip would tighten, holding her in place. "Let go of me, Shinji! I'm not worth it..." She continued to struggle against his embrace, but for each passing second the warmth soothed her worries more and more, causing her to fight less and less. After making another vain attempt to escape from his grasp, she finally broke down and gave into it. Teary eyed, Asuka wrapped her arms around Shinji and pulled him in as close as she could.  
起初她对此感到惊恐，试图推开他并挣脱他的束缚。但每次她试图挣脱，他的拥抱就会收紧，将她固定在原地。“放开我，真嗣！我不值得……”她继续挣扎，但随着每一秒过去，那份温暖逐渐平息了她的忧虑，使她越来越无力反抗。在一次徒劳的逃离尝试后，她终于崩溃，屈服了。泪眼朦胧中，明日香伸出双臂，紧紧抱住真嗣，尽可能地贴近他。

At the moment she didn't care about anything else anymore. Not the Angels. Not her legs. Not the EVAs. She had something right now, and she didn't want to let it go. "I'm always here for you, Asuka." Shinji whispered gently, slowly stroking her golden-red mane.  
此刻，她不再关心其他任何事。不在乎使徒，不在乎自己的双腿，不在乎 EVA。她现在拥有了一些东西，她不想放手。“我永远在这里陪着你，明日香。”真嗣轻声细语，温柔地抚摸着她金红色的秀发。

"I know you are." She replied, slowly pulling herself back, but keeping her hands on Shinji, not breaking contact with him. At the moment Asuka realized she didn't need to hate everything in the world. Relishing in the warmth of the physical contact, Asuks's sick desire to watch the world burn was replaced by the fear of losing someone she cared about.  
"我知道你是。" 她回答道，慢慢地将自己拉回，但双手仍放在真嗣身上，没有中断与他的接触。此刻，明日香意识到她不需要憎恨世界上的一切。沉浸在身体接触的温暖中，明日香那病态的想要看世界燃烧的欲望被对失去她在乎的人的恐惧所取代。

"Here, let me take care of your hand," said Shinji softly as he took out a first aid box. Asuka made no resistance whatsoever as Shinji cleaned her wounds on her knuckles with cotton balls soaked with antibiotic ointments and wrapped her hands with bandages.  
"来，让我来处理你的手。" 真嗣轻声说着，拿出一个急救箱。明日香没有任何抗拒，任由真嗣用浸有抗生素药膏的棉球清洁她手背上的伤口，并用绷带包扎起来。

"Shinji?" Asuka started after her wounds were taken care of.  
"真嗣？" 处理完伤口后，明日香开口道。

"Yeah, Asuka?" "嗯，明日香？"

"Will you please stay with me tonight? I don't want to be alone right now."  
"今晚你能陪我吗？我现在不想一个人。"

The boy nodded. "Of course. I promise."  
男孩点点头。"当然。我保证。"

That was all she needed to hear. Just the sheer fact alone that he would stand by her during this time of bleakness, during this time of despair, warmed her heart and soothed her of all the pain and torment she had felt. It was still there, buried, but for the moment at least, it had been relieved.  
她需要的只是听到这些。仅仅是他愿意在这段阴暗、绝望的时期陪伴她，这个事实本身就温暖了她的心，抚慰了她所感受到的所有痛苦和折磨。那份痛苦依然存在，只是被埋藏了，但至少此刻，它得到了缓解。

None of them noticed a pair of eyes watching them intently but silently just across the corridor.  
他们都没有注意到，走廊对面有一双眼睛正默默地、专注地注视着他们。

Kaji exhaled a cloud of smoke, looking up at the night sky on the balcony, a cigarette in his mouth. "Is it safe to let them sleep together?" Misato Katsuragi started with a thoughtful expression on her face. "They are both teenagers high on hormones, what if-"  
"加持在阳台上吐出一口烟雾，抬头望着夜空，嘴里叼着一根烟。“让他们睡在一起安全吗？”葛城美里若有所思地问道，“他们都是青春期的少男少女，荷尔蒙旺盛，万一……”

She trailed off as Kaji shook his head, gesturing her to stop talking. "I trust Shinji to not take advantage of her under such state if that's what you're concerned with," he threw the smoked cigarette on the ground and stomped on it, putting out the sparks. "I…had a talk with him today."  
她话音未落，只见加持摇了摇头，示意她别再说了。“我相信真嗣在这种情况下不会占她便宜，如果你担心的是这个的话，”他扔掉烟头，用脚踩灭了火星。“我……今天和他谈过了。”

Misato raised her eyebrow at his words as well as the serious tone he used. "What did you talk about to put such trust into him? I mean, I know he's not the type of a guy who thinks with his genitals, but…sleeping in the same bed? That's a bit too much…" Misato's expression turned ponderous as she recalled Shinji's behavior. During the months they lived together, Shinji showed a level of restraint she didn't even know existed. That one time when Asuka's towel accidentally slipped off her body after she came out of the shower, Shinji diverted his eyes in lighting-speed without hesitation. Even though he stilled got a smack from the furious redhead, Misato was positively impressed by his manners.  
美里对他的话以及他使用的严肃语气挑了挑眉。“你们谈了什么，让他如此信任他？我的意思是，我知道他不是那种用下半身思考的家伙，但是……睡在同一张床上？这有点太过分了……”美里的表情变得沉思起来，她回想起真嗣的行为。在他们共同生活的几个月里，真嗣展现出了她甚至不知道存在的自制力。有一次，明日香洗完澡出来，毛巾不小心从身上滑落，真嗣以闪电般的速度毫不犹豫地移开了视线。尽管他还是被愤怒的红发女孩打了一巴掌，但美里对他的礼貌印象深刻。

"He's not a teenager, Katsuragi," Kaji spoke with an odd expression, eliciting a look from Misato that questioned his intelligence, which sometimes she did. He noticed her face so he quickly added, "I mean, biologically sure he is, but the way he talks?" The triple-spy chuckled, "I'd say he's totally an adult. A real man even." Just before the lavender-haired woman was about to retort, Kaji added, "Much more so than you, Katsuragi. Considering what you did today."  
“他不是青少年，葛城，”加持带着奇怪的表情说道，这让美里投来质疑他智力的目光，她有时确实会这么做。他注意到她的表情，于是迅速补充道，“我是说，从生物学上讲，当然是，但他谈话的方式呢？”这位三重间谍轻笑道，“我觉得他完全是个成年人。甚至可以说是个真正的男人。”就在紫发女子准备反驳之前，加持补充道，“比你更甚，葛城。考虑到你今天做的事。”

Misato blushed in embarrassment, all of her hot retorts died in her throat. "Well, what about Asuka, then?"  
美里尴尬得脸红了，所有尖锐的反驳都卡在了喉咙里。“那么，明日香呢？”

"She's an intelligent girl, she knows who can trust," Kaji replied firmly before his tone turned slightly amused, "seriously though Katsuragi, do you really think she's gonna try anything improper under her current…crippled state?"  
“她是个聪明的女孩，知道谁可以信任，”加持坚定地回答，随后语气略带戏谑，“不过说真的，葛城，你真的认为她会在她目前的……这种状态下做出什么不妥的事吗？”

"I suppose you're right…" Misato sighed in resignation. A period of awkward silence descended upon the ex-couple as both of them were immersed in their own sea of thoughts. "Well, what are they gonna do with Asuka, then?" The Captain of NERV suddenly asked, breaking the silence.  
“我想你是对的……”美里叹了口气，无奈地接受了。一段尴尬的沉默笼罩着这对前情侣，两人都沉浸在自己的思绪中。“那么，他们打算怎么处理明日香呢？”NERV 的指挥官突然问道，打破了沉默。

Kaji massaged his temple; this was another standing issue in front of them. A crippled reserve pilot living in Misato's apartment whom he cared about like a daughter he never had, Kaji had been digging into the chain of command trying to get a glimpse of what's going on under the turbulent flow. "They're talking about sending her back to Germany," he finally said, his voice carried a hint of sadness, "after all, she's a…property of NERV Berlin. I think they give us one week before we must hand her back to them."  
加持揉了揉太阳穴；这是他们面前的另一个悬而未决的问题。一个住在美里公寓里的残疾预备驾驶员，他像对待自己从未有过的女儿一样关心她，加持一直在深入调查指挥链，试图窥见动荡局势下的真相。“他们正讨论把她送回德国，”他终于说道，声音中带着一丝悲伤，“毕竟，她是……NERV 柏林的财产。我想他们给我们一周时间，之后就必须把她交还给他们。”

"Wait they can't do that!" Misato exclaimed, at which Kaji simply shrugged resignedly, "at least she has people who care about her here. Who will look after her back there? You aren't going back with her, are you?" Her last question, although she didn't realize it by herself, had two major fears behind it, and she's not going to admit one of them.  
“等等，他们不能这么做！”美里惊呼道，加持只是无奈地耸了耸肩，“至少她在这里有人关心她。回到那里谁会照顾她？你不会和她一起回去吧？”她的最后一个问题，虽然她自己并未意识到，背后隐藏着两大恐惧，而她并不打算承认其中之一。

Kaji shook his head. "I don't think so. I'm here as a special inspector, so I can't go anywhere far away."  
加持摇了摇头。“我不这么认为。我作为特别监察员在这里，所以不能去太远的地方。”

"This is fucked up," Misato cursed, her eyes flaring with fire. "We all see how…bad of a state she's in right now. Sending her back to a place where no one cares about her? I'm afraid she's gonna…" The dark assumption never articulated in her mouth since she dreaded it very possible to happen.  
“这太扯了，”美里咒骂道，眼中燃起怒火。“我们都看得出她现在状态有多糟糕。把她送回一个没人关心她的地方？我担心她会……”那个黑暗的猜测在她嘴里从未说出口，因为她害怕这极有可能发生。

"I'll see what I can do," Kaji let out a frustrated grumble. He cared about the poor little girl too much he didn't want to send her back to a place where he didn't trust. He had seen so many during the time he stayed at NERV Berlin, not to mention Asuka's asshole father and stepmother. Her father never cared about Asuka's wellbeing, while her stepmother only cared about modeling the elite pilot into a perfect doll. Kaji didn't dare to think of what would happen to Asuka - who now was basically useless to them - if she fell into their hands.  
“我会看看能做些什么，”加持沮丧地咕哝道。他太关心这个可怜的小女孩了，不想把她送回一个他不信任的地方。他在柏林 NERV 期间见过太多这样的事，更不用说明日香那混蛋父亲和继母了。她父亲从未关心过明日香的福祉，而她的继母只在乎将这位精英驾驶员塑造成一个完美的玩偶。加持不敢想象，如果明日香——现在对他们来说基本无用——落入他们手中，会发生什么。

Kaji sighed as he realized how grim the situation was. As a spy, he was always walking on a fine line, carefully making every move to avoid getting erased, which meant he couldn't take care of Asuka forever. Therefore, he had been keeping finding someone right to do his job.  
加治叹了口气，意识到情况的严峻。作为一名间谍，他总是如履薄冰，小心翼翼地每一步都避免被抹杀，这意味着他无法永远照顾明日香。因此，他一直在寻找合适的人选来接替他的工作。

Kaji smiled a small smile as the image of a certain boy crossed his mind. Maybe he had already found the right person…  
加治微微一笑，脑海中闪过一个少年的身影。或许，他已经找到了合适的人选……

The morning sun had arisen and peaked through Asuka's bedroom window, beaming down onto her motionless body. Grumbling as she tried to toss and turn to get the bright rays of light out of her eyes, then let out a sorrowful sigh as she recalled her disabled state.  
清晨的阳光已经升起，透过明日香的卧室窗户洒在她静止不动的身体上。她咕哝着试图翻身，将刺眼的光线从眼前赶走，随后发出一声哀叹，回想起自己瘫痪的状态。

Nevertheless, she could feel something strange. She was still in her house clothes, and she could feel something around her, a weight pressing down over her stomach. Looking to her right, she found the sleeping form of Shinji Ikari next to her, with his arm extended and wrapped around her. She couldn't remember what had happened between now and when they fell asleep together, only that there was an emotional turmoil.  
尽管如此，她能感觉到某种异样。她仍穿着家居服，感到有什么东西环绕着她，一种重量压在她的腹部。向右看去，她发现碇真嗣正睡在旁边，手臂伸展开来，环绕着她。她记不清从他们一起入睡到现在发生了什么，只记得当时情绪纷乱。

The fact that they had slept together worried her a lot at first, and the only solace she could found from the fact that they still had their clothes on.  
起初，他们同床共枕的事实让她非常担忧，唯一让她稍感安慰的是他们还穿着衣服。

At the time the said boy stirred, letting out a low yawn. "Shinji?" Asuka whispered into his ear. "Oh…good morning Asuka," Shinji greeted as he moved his arm away from her waist and rubbed his eyes.  
就在这时，那男孩动了动，发出一声低沉的哈欠。“真嗣？”明日香轻声在他耳边唤道。“哦……早安，明日香。”真嗣说着，将手臂从她的腰间移开，揉了揉眼睛。

"Em, you didn't…take advantage of me, did you?" Asuka asked nervously, blushing a little.  
"嗯，你没……占我便宜吧？" 明日香紧张地问道，脸上泛起一丝红晕。

"Huh? No of course not," Shinji hastily replied as he stretched his body, his voice sounded a little bit hurt. "Asuka, I would never take advantage of you. Do you really think-"  
"啊？当然没有，" 真嗣急忙回答，同时伸展着身体，声音听起来有些受伤。"明日香，我绝不会占你便宜。你真的这么想-"

He was silenced by a finger put on his lips. "I know you wouldn't, and that's why I trusted you to sleep next to me," she said in a serious tone before a smirk crept up her face. "Now go make me breakfast, I'm starving."  
他的话被放在唇边的手指打断了。"我知道你不会，这也是为什么我信任你，让你睡在我旁边，" 她严肃地说，随即嘴角露出一丝笑意。"现在去给我做早餐，我快饿死了。"

"Will you be okay being alone here?" Shinji probed as he got into a sitting position on the bed. "You wouldn't-" He trailed off, pointing the finger at the knife thrown away at the corner of the room.  
"你一个人在这里会没事吗？" 真嗣一边问，一边在床上坐起身来。"你不会——"他话说到一半，手指向房间角落里被扔掉的刀。

Asuka's face turned red in embarrassment as she recalled what she tried to do last night. In retrospect, she would've regretted it, not that she could regret anymore if she really did it. "No… I'm…out of it. I feel much better now," she replied in a grateful tone. "I will be okay…just promise you won't be away for long, okay?"  
明日香的脸因尴尬而泛红，她回想起昨晚试图做的事情。事后想来，她本会后悔的，但如果真的做了，她也无法再后悔了。“不……我……已经没事了。我现在感觉好多了。”她用感激的语气回答，“我会没事的……只要你保证不会离开太久，好吗？”

"I promise," Shinji's response came out without hesitation, soothing Asuka's insecurities a bit more. The said boy lifted himself up and made his way out of Asuka's room, leaving her to lie on the bed. Once he was out of the room, the storm of thoughts formed again in the redhead's mind. What did this make them? Were they a couple now? Were they supposed to hold hands everywhere they went? Asuka mused as she lay on her bed, blushing as she recalled the sensation of having her lips around his that time when she performed CPR to save his life. It was a pleasant feeling, to say the least, and she found she's not so opposed to the idea of trying it again in the future-  
“我保证。”真嗣毫不犹豫地回答，稍稍安抚了明日香的疑虑。这个男孩起身离开了明日香的房间，留下她躺在床上。他一离开房间，红发少女的脑海中再次涌起了思绪的风暴。这让他们变成了什么关系？他们现在是情侣了吗？他们是不是应该走到哪里都牵着手？明日香躺在床上沉思，脸颊泛红，回想起那次她用嘴对嘴的方式给他做人工呼吸救他时的感觉。那是一种愉悦的感觉，至少可以说，她发现自己并不反对将来再尝试一次这个想法——

Her musings were interrupted by the knockings on the bedroom door. "Come in," she said, wondering how come did Shinji finish making breakfast so quickly. The door slid open, revealing a jacket-wearing Kaji Ryoji standing in the corridor, a smug look on his face. "Um, good morning, Kaji," Asuka greeted the husky man, not sure what he wanted to do.  
她的沉思被卧室门的敲击声打断。"进来，"她说，好奇真嗣怎么这么快就做好了早餐。门滑开了，穿着夹克的加持良治站在走廊上，脸上带着得意的笑容。"呃，早上好，加持先生，"明日香向这位魁梧的男人打招呼，不太确定他想要做什么。

"Good morning, kiddo," Kaji greeted back, his small smile turned into a grin as he could see from Asuka's positive behavior that things were turning in a better direction. "Had a good night's sleep?"  
"早上好，小家伙，" 加持回以问候，看到明日香积极的态度，他那微小的笑容变成了咧嘴笑，知道事情正在朝着更好的方向发展。"睡得好吗？"

"Yeah," Asuka replied casually, stretching her arms. Last night's sleep was one of the best sleep she got in years; last time she had something similar was the night before Israfel battle when she slept next to Shinji. Even though two was a fairly small sample size for conducting any statistically significant research, Asuka could still see the general trend behind it. She had no idea whether it was _Shinji_ doing the magic, or just having anyone by her side could do the trick.  
“嗯，”明日香随意地回答，伸了个懒腰。昨晚的睡眠是她多年来最好的一次；上一次类似的经历是在与伊斯拉斐尔战斗的前夜，当时她和真嗣睡在一起。尽管两次样本数量相当小，不足以进行任何具有统计意义的调查，但明日香仍能看出其中的大致趋势。她不知道这是真嗣施展的魔法，还是仅仅有人在她身边就能产生效果。

Not that she cared to find out.  
她并不在乎找出答案。

As long she had Shinji, she didn't need anyone else. He made a promise, didn't he?  
只要她有真嗣，就不需要其他人。他许下了承诺，不是吗？

Still, Asuka found it somewhat uncomfortable to be totally dependent on him, even though she needed it. She wasn't sure how Shinji felt about having her clinging to him twenty-four-seven, so she intended to get rid of this unhealthy dependence as soon as possible.  
尽管如此，完全依赖他还是让明日香感到有些不自在，即便她确实需要这种依赖。她不确定真嗣对于她二十四小时都黏着他的感受如何，所以她打算尽快摆脱这种不健康的依赖。

"I see Shinji's a good guy," Kaji continued with a playful expression. "He's a pilot, he looks cute. He _cooks._ Most importantly, he's…well, safe."  
"我看真嗣是个好人，" 加持继续带着玩味的表情说。"他是驾驶员，长得可爱。还会做饭。最重要的是，他……嗯，安全。"

"Kaji…" Asuka said in exasperation. "Are you trying to…pair us?"  
"加持……" 明日香无奈地说。"你是在试图……撮合我们吗？"

"Just saying, it's good to have a…close acquaintance."  
"只是说，有个……亲密的朋友挺好的。"

"But a close acquaintance should be mutual," Asuka retorted. "Now it's just him taking care of me, while I couldn't do anything in return! I don't want to…owe him or anything. What if he decides I'm too much of a trouble and runs away?"  
“但亲密关系应该是相互的，”明日香反驳道，“现在只是他在照顾我，而我却无以为报！我不想……欠他什么。万一他觉得我太麻烦了，跑掉了怎么办？”

"There's a lot you can do without…well, your legs," Kaji carefully spoke the last few words. His heart sunk as he saw the pained expression that crossed Asuka's face. "Have you read his files?" _'Not that much of them are true anymore…'_ "I'd say you two are a lot more alike than you might think. He needs your help as well."  
“有很多事情你不需要……呃，用腿也能做，”加持小心翼翼地说出最后几个字。看到明日香脸上闪过的痛苦表情，他的心沉了下去。“你读过他的档案吗？”‘那些资料现在也不尽真实了……’“我觉得你们俩比你自己想的要更相似。他也需要你的帮助。”

"How?" “怎么？”

"You need to find out the answer by yourself, I can't feed you everything," Kaji replied in a more serious tone. "The only thing I can say is sometimes emotional support is much more useful than physical ones."  
"你需要自己找出答案，我不能事事都喂给你，" 加持用更严肃的语气回答。"我唯一能说的是，有时候情感支持比物质帮助要有效得多。"

"I…see," Asuka replied half-heartedly. She found Kaji's words extremely truthful since she realized the emotional clutch Shinji provided indeed helped her more than all the physical ones like cooking, cleaning, and helping her move around. Still, she had no idea of how to reciprocate the effort, but she was determined to find out.  
"我…明白了，" 明日香半信半疑地回答。她觉得加持的话非常真实，因为她意识到真嗣提供的情感支持确实比做饭、打扫和帮她移动这些物质帮助更有用。尽管如此，她还是不知道如何回报这份努力，但她决心要找到方法。"

The breakfast consisted of some simple scrambled eggs and toasts; under normal circumstances she would've complained about how repetitive they were, but it was pretty low on her priority list for now. "Do we have any plans today?" she suddenly asked, eliciting a raised eyebrow from Shinji, who was sitting at her bedside.  
早餐是一些简单的炒蛋和吐司；在正常情况下，她可能会抱怨它们多么单调，但目前这并不在她的优先事项清单上。"我们今天有什么计划吗？" 她突然问道，这让坐在她床边的真嗣挑了挑眉。

"Taking care of you, of course," Shinji replied in a slightly confused tone.  
"当然是照顾你啊，" 真嗣略带困惑地回答道。

"Don't you have school today, I mean?" Asuka added, still focused on the plate in front of her.  
"你今天不是还要上学吗，我是说？" 明日香补充道，依旧专注于她面前的盘子。

"Asuka…you are much more important than…some grades," Shinji reassured as he put a glass of milk on the small table Asuka used for having meals. "Here, drink some of this."  
"明日香…你比…那些成绩重要多了，" 真嗣安慰道，同时在她用餐的小桌上放了一杯牛奶。"来，喝点这个。

"Thanks," Asuka muttered as she accepted the glass, her heart fluttered hearing his words. After gulping down a mouthful, she continued, "well, I don't want you to leave, that's for sure. But did you ask Misato about it?"  
"谢谢，" 明日香咕哝着接过玻璃杯，听到他的话，她的心不由得一颤。喝了一口后，她继续说道，"好吧，我当然不想你离开。但你问过美里了吗？"

"Well I didn't, but I think she'll approve-"  
"好吧，我没有，但我想她会同意——"

"Who said I will?" Misato abruptly interjected, walking into the bedroom. "Shinji you have to go to school, Kaji will look after her, so don't worry."  
"谁说我会的？" 美里突然插话，走进卧室。"真嗣，你得去上学，加持会照顾她的，所以别担心。"

Just a few days earlier, the idea of Kaji babysitting her would've made Asuka's day, but for some unspoken reason, it was suppressed by the worry of the concept of Shinji leaving. To her relief, Shinji seemed to hate the idea as well, "you can't be serious Misato!"  
就在几天前，让加持照顾她的想法还会让明日香高兴一整天，但出于某种未言明的原因，这种想法被对真嗣离开的担忧所压制。让她松了一口气的是，真嗣似乎也很讨厌这个主意，"你不是认真的吧，美里！"

"Shinji you've already missed a lot of school recently, and we're not talking about one or two days of absence here, which I could arrange." Misato replied firmly, "who knows how long it will take for Asuka to recover? Months maybe? I can't just suspend you from school while we have better options."  
"真嗣，你最近已经缺了很多课，我们说的可不是一两天的事，这种我还能安排。" 美里坚定地回答，"谁知道明日香要多久才能恢复？可能是几个月呢？我们不能在有更好选择的情况下让你休学。"

"Misato, there's no way I will-"  
"美里，我绝不会-"

He was cut off by another firm voice. "Well if that's the case I'll go to school with Shinji then," Asuka said. "They have elevators in school right? So there won't be too many problems."  
他被另一个坚定的声音打断。“既然如此，那我就和真嗣一起去上学，”明日香说，“学校里有电梯对吧？这样就不会有太多问题。”

"Are you serious?" “你是认真的吗？”

"Or course I am," Asuka stated. "I'm getting sick of lying here doing nothing. I want some fresh air, and meet my friends at school as well." She left the real reason unsaid, but from the looks on Shinji's face she knew he understood.  
“当然，”明日香坚定地说，“我厌倦了躺在这里无所事事。我想呼吸新鲜空气，也想在学校见见我的朋友们。”她没有说出真正的原因，但从真嗣的表情中，她知道他明白了。

"Fine…how about this," Misato conceded after a moment of thinking, "I'll let Shinji look after you today, considering you…apparently need a wash," she said, pointing the finger at her messy hair and clothes. Asuka nodded; she could still smell the stinky unwashed LCL from her body. "Tomorrow you two can go to school together. But if anything I wouldn't approve happens at school…it will be over."  
"好吧……这样如何，"美里思考片刻后让步道，"今天让真嗣照顾你，考虑到你……显然需要洗个澡，"她指着她凌乱的头发和衣服说。明日香点头；她还能闻到身上未清洗的 LCL 的臭味。"明天你们俩一起去上学。但如果学校里发生任何我不赞成的事……那就完了。"

Both teens looked at each other before nodding in unison. Misato let out a sigh, "it's settled then. Shinji, please take good care of our princess. I still have paperwork to catch up…Kaji, stay with them for as long as you can, alright?"  
两个少年对视一眼，然后齐齐点头。美里叹了口气，"那就这么定了。真嗣，请好好照顾我们的公主。我还有文书工作要赶……加持，尽可能和他们待在一起，好吗？"

"Hai." Kaji consented. "好的。"加持同意道。

Asuka watched Misato leave in an inscrutable expression. Kaji's words were still lingering in her mind; Shinji needed her help? That still sounded impossible to her. Nevertheless, she was sure that there's no emotional support she could offer him right now, considering she was an emotional wreck herself. As for physical ones, she had very little she could do under her crippled state.  
明日香看着美里带着难以捉摸的表情离开。加持的话依旧在她脑海中回响；真嗣需要她的帮助？这听起来对她来说仍然是不可能的。尽管如此，考虑到自己也是个情感上的废人，她确信自己现在无法给他任何情感上的支持。至于身体上的帮助，在她残疾的状态下，她能做的也非常有限。

But she also feared that if she didn't act fast enough Shinji would eventually get tired of her and leave her. No matter how difficult it was, she needed to offer him something to make him stay.  
但她同时也担心，如果她不尽快采取行动，真嗣最终会对她感到厌倦并离开她。无论多么困难，她需要给他一些东西让他留下来。

**Chapter 13: Omission 第十三章：省略**

"You two behave at home, alright?" Kaji Ryoji said after glancing at his watch, telling him it was time to resume his 'work'. He didn't want to leave Asuka, but this time Shinji was there to look after her, and he had already earned his trust. If he could allow them to sleep in the same bed, one or two hours alone at home wouldn't be much of a deal. "Bye, kiddos."  
“你们俩在家要乖，好吗？”加持良治瞥了一眼手表，告诉他该回去“工作”了。他不想离开明日香，但这次有真嗣在照顾她，而且他已经赢得了他的信任。如果他能让她们睡在同一张床上，那么在家独处一两个小时也不算什么大事。“再见，孩子们。”

"See you later Kaji-san," Shinji waved his hand as Kaji exited the front door. He furrowed his brows as the expected goodbye from the redhead never came. Shinji walked into the living room where Asuka was leaning back on the newly delivered couch watching TV, although her eyes were only staring at the screen blankly, not really paying too much attention to the content.  
“再见，加持先生。”真嗣挥手告别，加持走出了前门。他皱起眉头，因为红发少女预期的告别始终没有到来。真嗣走进客厅，看到明日香正靠在新送来的沙发上看着电视，尽管她的眼睛只是茫然地盯着屏幕，并没有真正关注内容。

Shinji let out a sigh. Asuka seemed fine in the morning; however after Misato left the apartment, she gradually returned to her previous preoccupied state. The only blessing was that he could see she wasn't suicidal anymore, even though she's still depressed. The fact that Asuka didn't even try to get Kaji's attention spoke louder than any words.  
真嗣叹了口气。早上明日香看起来还好；然而在美里离开公寓后，她逐渐回到了之前心事重重的状态。唯一值得庆幸的是，他可以看出她不再有自杀倾向，尽管她仍然抑郁。明日香甚至没有试图引起加持的注意，这一事实比任何言语都更有力。

"Asuka? Do you need something?" Shinji asked warily as he put down a glass of water on the table in front of her. Having Asuka clinging to him like a life-saving straw wasn't exactly the _healthy_ relationship he aimed for, and he wished she could grow out of it as soon as possible, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to fulfill her basic needs.  
“明日香？你需要什么吗？”真嗣小心翼翼地问道，同时将一杯水放在她面前的桌子上。让明日香像救命稻草一样紧抓着他，并不是他所追求的健康关系，他希望她能尽快摆脱这种状态，但这并不意味着他不会满足她的基本需求。

The said girl turned her head in his direction, locking their gazes. For a moment, neither of the two roommates said anything, patiently waiting in Shinji's case, making a difficult decision in Asuka's case. He could clearly see the turmoil of emotions through her eyes – fear, insecurity, sadness, and finally, determination. "Yeah," the redhead's voice came to him. "I wanna take a shower."  
她转过头来，两人的目光交汇。一时间，两位室友都没有说话，真嗣耐心等待着，而明日香则在艰难地做决定。他可以清楚地从她的眼中看到情绪的纷乱——恐惧、不安、悲伤，最终是决心。“嗯，”红发女孩的声音传来，“我想洗个澡。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow, "Huh? You won't mind-"  
真嗣挑了挑眉，“嗯？你不会介意——”

Seeing Asuka shake her head Shinji nodded slowly. Unlike what he had expected, bathing had actually been a reasonably easy task for her to do. Even under her crippled state, Asuka could still change the clothes by herself; all that needed to be done was to put a towel-wrapped Asuka in the bathtub, and she could help herself from then. Even though Misato had always been the one carrying her to the bathtub, Shinji deemed this wouldn't be much of an embarrassment for him, considering he had already seen and touched more in his other cycles, not to mention now it was Asuka herself who asked him to do it.  
看到明日香摇头，真嗣缓缓点头。与他的预期不同，洗澡对她来说实际上是一项相当轻松的任务。即使在残疾状态下，明日香仍然能够自己更换衣服；需要做的只是将裹着毛巾的明日香放入浴缸，然后她就能自己完成剩下的步骤。尽管美里一直是将她抱进浴缸的那个人，但真嗣认为这对他来说不会太尴尬，毕竟他在其他周期中已经见过并触摸过更多，更不用说现在是明日香自己要求他这么做的。

Shinji waited outside of her bedroom after he put Asuka and a towel on her bed. Moments later, he heard a loud "I'm done." He slid the door open and saw Asuka had already wrapped her slender body in the white towel, raising her arms horizontally, waiting for him to carry her. Shinji picked her up from bed, brought her to the bathroom, and put the redhead down into the bathtub. "Here, you'll need these," he said as he placed a bottle of shampoo and shower gel on the floor beside her. After everything was settled, Shinji turned around, walking toward the bathroom door.  
真嗣在她卧室外等候，将明日香和一条毛巾放在床上。片刻后，他听到一声响亮的“我好了。”他拉开移门，看到明日香已经用白色毛巾裹住她纤细的身体，双臂平举，等待他来抱她。真嗣从床上抱起她，带到浴室，将红发女孩放入浴缸。“这里，你需要这些，”他说着，将一瓶洗发水和沐浴露放在她旁边的地板上。一切安顿好后，真嗣转身，走向浴室门口。

_'In for a penny…In for a pound. It's now or never.'_ Asuka thought as an expression mixed with shame and determination crossed her face. "Shinji," she called out to the boy whose left foot was already outside the threshold. Upon capturing his attention, she continued, "I didn't say you can leave."  
“一不做二不休，机不可失。”明日香心想，脸上浮现出羞愧与决心交织的表情。“真嗣，”她对着那只左脚已跨出门槛的男孩喊道。吸引他的注意后，她继续说，“我没说你可以走。”

"What do you mean, Asuka?" Shinji asked, although knowing Asuka, he could already guess what she was going to ask him to do.  
“你什么意思，明日香？”真嗣问，尽管了解明日香，他已经能猜到她会要求他做什么。

"Anta Baka? I need some help with the shower."  
"你是笨蛋吗？我需要帮忙洗澡。"

Shinji sighed in confirmation of his guess. "Asuka…do you think this is appropriate?"  
真嗣叹了口气，证实了自己的猜测。"明日香……你觉得这样合适吗？"

"What? Too scared to touch a girl?" Asuka mocked in a semi-playful tone, a stark contrast to her all day of dullness. "C'mon, there are spots I can't reach, but LCL did. I'd really appreciate it if you can help me wash those places."  
"什么？不敢碰女孩子吗？"明日香半开玩笑地嘲讽道，与她一整天的沉闷形成鲜明对比。"来吧，有些地方我够不到，但 LCL 却能。如果你能帮我洗那些地方，我会非常感激的。"

"Asuka…we can wait for Misato to come home and let her do this," Shinji rejected firmly. He knew perfectly well that Asuka being too insecure, was offering him her body to make sure he wouldn't leave her. How could he convince her that 'leaving her' wouldn't be an option unless it's the end of the world?  
“明日香…我们可以等美里回来，让她来做这件事，”真嗣坚定地拒绝道。他非常清楚，明日香因为极度缺乏安全感，才提出用自己的身体来确保他不会离开。他该如何说服她，除非世界末日，否则‘离开她’根本不在选项之内呢？

Asuka gulped as she heard his response. Shinji just rejected her offering her body…why? "Baka! Misato's not gonna come home in several hours, and I _really_ need a proper shower right now," she hissed, trying her best to hide the pain in her voice. "So, are you gonna help me or what?!"  
明日香听到他的回答后咽了口唾沫。真嗣刚刚拒绝了她的身体……为什么？“笨蛋！美里几个小时后才会回来，我现在真的需要好好洗个澡，”她低声咆哮，尽力掩饰声音中的痛苦。“所以，你到底帮不帮我？！”

"Asuka, why are you doing this?" Shinji asked, locking his gaze with hers.  
“明日香，你为什么要这么做？”真嗣问道，目光紧紧锁定在她身上。

"What are you, stupid? Because I-" Asuka trailed off as a wave of doubts surged up her mind. Why would he reject such an opportunity which boys in school would literally kill for? Was he just respectful to her modesty, or…he didn't like her figures? But he said she was 'the prettiest girl in our school, even in entire Tokyo-3', didn't he? Or was it just a lie to make her feel better? Asuka growled in frustration. "Aw fuck it, you know what Ikari, just get out and leave me alone."  
"你是不是傻？因为我就——" 明日香的话音未落，一波疑虑涌上心头。他为何会拒绝这样一个学校里的男生们几乎会为之拼命的机会？是因为他尊重她的矜持，还是……他不喜欢她的身材？但他不是说过她是“我们学校最漂亮的女孩，甚至在整座第三新东京市都是”吗？还是说那只是为了让她感觉好些的谎言？明日香懊恼地咆哮道：“啊，去他妈的，你知道吗，碇真嗣，滚出去，让我一个人待着。”

"Asuka…" Shinji sighed. "I will help you if you promise me something."  
"明日香……" 真嗣叹了口气。"如果你答应我一件事，我会帮你的。”

"What?" Asuka asked with a glimmer of hope in her voice.  
"什么？" 明日香的声音中带着一丝希望。

"Promise you're doing this for yourself, but not for me."  
"答应我，你这么做是为了自己，而不是为了我。"

Asuka blinked as the realization dawned on her – Shinji apparently saw through her as if she was a piece of glass. "Alright…I promise." She replied half-heartedly before letting out a long breath. "Shinji…what do you want from me?"  
意识到这一点，明日香眨了眨眼——真嗣显然看穿了她，仿佛她是一块透明玻璃。“好吧……我答应你。”她半心半意地回答，然后长长地呼出一口气。“真嗣……你到底想要我怎样？”

"Asuka, like I said I'm not leaving you. You don't have to do anything for me."  
"明日香，就像我说的，我不会离开你。你不需要为我做任何事。"

It's not like he deserved anything from her…after how much he had failed her.  
他并没有从她那里得到什么的资格……毕竟他让她失望了那么多。

"Though there's one thing you can do…"  
“不过有一件事你可以做……”

"Yes?" “是？”

"I..." Shinji pondered for a moment. He needed to prescribe the right medicine under a delicate situation like this. "I want to see a confident Asuka, a smiling Asuka. The Asuka I know will pay back the hit on her pride with interest. And most importantly..." He smiled a warm smile. "A happy Asuka."  
“我……” 真嗣沉思片刻。在这种微妙的情境下，他需要开出合适的药方。“我想看到自信的明日香，微笑的明日香。我所认识的明日香会加倍偿还她自尊所受的打击。而最重要的是……”他露出了温暖的笑容。“一个快乐的明日香。”

Asuka found herself at a loss for words. _'Be happy…I don't think I could anymore without you…'_ Completely ignoring the heavy implications of her thought, she smirked, "well I will be happy if I get a proper wash right now."  
明日香发现自己无言以对。'要幸福……没有你，我想我再也做不到……'完全忽略了这想法的沉重含义，她轻蔑一笑，“好吧，如果现在能好好洗个澡，我会很开心的。”

"You're just not giving it up, are you?" Shinji chuckled. "Okay I'll help you then, if this really makes you happy." He smiled internally as he saw how _relieved_ she looked, instead of the extreme nervousness and anxiety she showed just moments ago. "Still, I don't want to…take advantage of you, or anything. We're not exactly-"  
“你就是不肯放弃，对吧？”真嗣轻声笑道。“好吧，那我就帮你，如果这真的能让你开心。”他内心微笑着，看到她如释重负的表情，而不是刚才那极度的紧张和焦虑。“不过，我不想……占你便宜，或者别的什么。我们毕竟不是……”

"Alright, alright," Asuka cut him off impatiently. She and Shinji's relationship was another elephant in the room she needed to take care of. "Bring my…um, bikini, then, if that makes you more comfortable. It's inside the third layer of my wardrobe with all of my undergarments." She conceded. "Just get to it! You do all of my laundries anyway, so there's nothing you haven't seen before." She quickly added after she saw the odd expression on his face.  
“好了，好了，”明日香不耐烦地打断他。她和真嗣的关系是另一个她需要处理的难题。“把我的……嗯，比基尼拿来，如果你觉得这样更自在。它在我衣柜的第三层，和所有内衣放在一起。”她让步道。“快去吧！反正我的衣服都是你洗的，没什么你没见过的。”她迅速补充，看到他脸上奇怪的表情。

"Sure thing." Shinji smiled a careful smile and proceeded to her room.  
“当然可以。” 真嗣小心翼翼地笑了笑，然后走向她的房间。

Shinji could practically feel the tension in the air during he and Asuka's car ride to school. At the wheel, Misato drove the vehicle uncharacteristically slow, seemingly had a lot on her mind. The passenger seat was occupied by Shinji while Asuka sat alone in the back row since she insisted this way. Shinji let her be since he knew it was just her pride preventing her from appearing more needy than necessary; it was a good sign that her pride was coming back.  
在和明日香一起乘车去学校的路上，真嗣几乎能感受到空气中的紧张气氛。坐在驾驶座上的美里开车异常缓慢，似乎心事重重。副驾驶座上坐着真嗣，而明日香则独自坐在后排，因为她坚持要这样。真嗣由她去，因为他知道这只是她的自尊心在作祟，不想显得比实际更需要帮助；这是一个好迹象，表明她的自尊心正在恢复。

Public transportation was out of the question since getting a wheelchair-riding Asuka on and off the bus would take a painfully long time, not to mention the buses likely wouldn't have enough space for a wheelchair anyway. Misato had complained a lot about having a big chunk of metal and plastic tied up on the roof of her treasured RA130 to disrupt its impeccable aesthetics. Still, she had no say in the business since the only other option was to change to a car that possessed a larger trunk.  
公共交通是不可能的，因为让坐轮椅的明日香上下公交车会花费极其漫长的时间，更不用说公交车很可能根本没有足够的空间容纳轮椅。美里对她的宝贝 RA130 车顶上绑着一大块金属和塑料破坏了其完美外观一事抱怨连连。不过，她在这件事上没有发言权，因为唯一的其他选择是换一辆后备箱更大的车。

Nevertheless, the strange combination still attracted a lot of unwanted attention along the way. Finally the accumulating pressure reached Misato's threshold before she suddenly spoke up, "that's it…I can't hide this anymore," she muttered to herself, sighing. "What's wrong, Misato?" Shinji probed, his nervousness growing as he saw the inscrutable expression on her face.  
尽管如此，这种奇怪的组合还是一路上吸引了不少不必要的注意。最终，累积的压力达到了美里所能承受的极限，她突然开口说道：“就这样吧……我再也藏不住了。”她自言自语地叹息道。“怎么了，美里？”真嗣问道，看到她那难以捉摸的表情，他的紧张感愈发强烈。

"They haven't told you yet…but NERV Germany is demanding us to transfer Asuka back. In one week."  
“他们还没告诉你……但德国 NERV 要求我们将明日香调回去。就在一周后。”

Shinji's eyes went wide, so did Asuka. "There's no way." He could feel an unnamed fire started burning inside his chest. In some of his former cycles, Asuka had told him about her horrific experience in Germany. If anything, he felt angry not because of Asuka's leaving, but she's going to get emotionally damaged even more.  
真嗣的眼睛瞪大了，明日香也是如此。“这不可能。”他感到胸中燃起了一股无名之火。在之前的某些循环中，明日香曾告诉他自己在德国的可怕经历。如果说有什么让他感到愤怒的，那不是因为明日香的离开，而是因为她将遭受更多的情感伤害。

"I'm sorry Shinji, but as a Captain of tactical division, there's nothing I can do," said Misato in resignation. She really hoped to use her power, however limited, to help her charges overcome the standing challenges, but a Captain was pretty low in the chain of command.  
“对不起，真嗣，但作为战术部队的队长，我无能为力。”美里无奈地说道。她真心希望能利用自己有限的力量帮助她的队员们克服眼前的挑战，但作为一名队长，她在指挥链中实在地位不高。

Asuka fell utterly silent after the initial shock. Germany had left her nothing but torturing memories – endless training, her so-called family, and how people treated her like a freak in college. Kaji could be said as the only glimmer of hope she had at the dark times, and that's why she quickly became infatuated with the hunky man.  
在最初的震惊之后，明日香完全沉默了。德国留给她的只有痛苦的回忆——无尽的训练，所谓的家庭，以及在大学里人们如何将她视为怪物。可以说，加持是她在黑暗时期唯一的希望之光，这也是她迅速迷恋上这个英俊男人的原因。

In simple terms, she despised the place, even though she admitted that Germany was a great country.  
简而言之，她对这个地方深恶痛绝，尽管她承认德国是一个伟大的国家。

Shinji took a glance at Asuka through her reflection in the rearview mirror; from her expression, he knew she didn't want to go back, either. Fortunately, there's another person - arguably the most powerful one in the world in a technical sense – he knew he could seek help from.  
真嗣透过后视镜瞥了一眼明日香的倒影；从她的表情中，他知道她也不想回去。幸运的是，还有一个人——可以说是技术层面上世界上最强大的人——他知道可以寻求帮助。

Upon approaching the school, the density of such attention reached a peak as nearly all of the kids turned heads curiously in their direction. With a hiss of brakes, the blue racing car halted in a parking lot inside the school. Misato got off the car first, dismounted the wheelchair, and put it down on the ground, while Shinji helped Asuka get out and carried her to the wheelchair.  
接近学校时，这种关注的密度达到了顶峰，几乎所有的孩子都好奇地转头看向他们。随着一阵刹车声，蓝色赛车在学校内的停车场停了下来。美里首先下车，卸下轮椅，放在地上，而真嗣帮助明日香下车并把她抱到轮椅上。

"Remember, behave yourselves at school," Misato repeated her condition once again as she got in her car. Shinji nodded in acknowledgment, "let's go Asuka." He said to the girl before she pushed the joystick forward, driving the wheelchair to the entrance of the main building. Shinji quickly caught up to her and jogged by her side.  
“记住，在学校要守规矩，”美里再次重复她的条件，然后上了车。真嗣点头表示明白，“我们走吧，明日香。”他对女孩说，然后向前推动操纵杆，驾驶轮椅向主楼入口驶去。真嗣迅速跟上，在她旁边小跑着。

Asuka kept a deep scowl on her face all the way to the elevator as students looked at her with mixed expressions. A majority of them simply looked more _curious_ than anything, perhaps due to they'd never seen an electric wheelchair before. What's getting on Asuka's nerves were the looks of sympathy she received, her mood deteriorating for each passing second. And the occasional _amused_ expressions she got didn't help things at all, if not making it much worse.  
从教室到电梯的这一路上，明日香始终紧绷着脸，学生们投来的目光复杂多样。大多数人只是显得比平时更加好奇，或许是因为他们从未见过电动轮椅。真正让明日香感到烦躁的是那些同情的眼神，每过一秒她的心情就更加恶劣。而偶尔出现的戏谑表情更是雪上加霜，如果不是让情况变得更糟的话。

She finally caught a break after they got into the elevator with no one else with them. Asuka looked at Shinji, who was looking at her with a deeply concerned look – the depth in his cobalt eyes like a blackhole sucked in all of her irritation and anxiety. She couldn't help but have her lips curled up a bit, which was probably the first genuine smile she had ever since the disastrous battle, at which Shinji smiled warmly as well.  
终于，当电梯里只剩下他们两人时，她得到了片刻的喘息。明日香看着真嗣，他正用深切关怀的眼神望着她——那深邃的钴蓝色眼眸仿佛黑洞一般，将她所有的烦躁和焦虑都吸了进去。她不由自主地微微扬起了嘴角，这或许是自那场灾难性战斗以来她的第一个真心的微笑，真嗣也温暖地回以微笑。

At that moment, Asuka again realized the real reason behind her detestation of going back to Germany.  
就在那一刻，明日香再次意识到她厌恶回到德国的真正原因。

She took a deep breath before entering Class 2-A. The last time she came here as an elite pilot and the queen of the school social ladder, while now she had none of these titles anymore. Upon entering she could hear gasps and whispers rippled through the classroom as her new 'accessory' drew everyone's attention. Thankfully the door was wide enough to let the wheelchair pass through, otherwise having Shinji carry her princess style into the classroom would definitely raise another bout of rumors and gossips.  
她深吸一口气，踏入了 2-A 班。上次她以精英飞行员的姿态和校园社交女王的身份来到这里，如今这些头衔已不复存在。一进门，她那新的“配饰”便吸引了所有人的目光，教室里顿时响起一片惊叹和窃窃私语。幸好门足够宽，轮椅能顺利通过，否则让真嗣像公主一样抱着她进教室，无疑会引发又一轮的流言蜚语。

"Asuka!" Came to the redhead a joyful exclaim. The girl turned in the direction of the voice and saw the pigtailed class rep standing up from her seat, running in her direction. "Oh my god, what happened?" She asked as she noticed Asuka's current state.  
“明日香！”红发女孩听到一声欢快的呼喊。她循声望去，看到扎着马尾的班级代表从座位上站起来，朝她跑来。“天哪，发生什么事了？”她注意到明日香的现状，关切地问道。

"I can't walk anymore…apparently."  
“我好像……再也走不了路了。”

"I feel-" "我感觉——"

"Don't say anything," Asuka cut her off with a firmer voice. "Just… don't." Saying, Asuka drove her wheelchair to the spot reserved for her and Shinji from some negotiation between NERV and the school, not noticing the confused and hurt look on Hikari's face. Asuka took out her laptop as soon as she parked her wheelchair and drowned herself in the digital world, trying to escape from the harsh reality. Shinji watched her isolating herself from the world around her with a pained expression, but there's nothing he could do at the moment without risking revealing too much of their relationship to the school.  
"别说话，" 明日香用更坚定的语气打断了她。"只是……别说了。" 说着，明日香驾驶她的轮椅来到 NERV 和学校协商为她与真嗣预留的位置，没有注意到希卡利脸上困惑和受伤的表情。明日香一停好轮椅就拿出笔记本电脑，沉浸在数字世界中，试图逃避残酷的现实。真嗣看着她与周围世界隔绝的样子，脸上露出痛苦的表情，但此刻他什么也做不了，以免过多暴露他们之间的关系给学校。

"Yo, Shin-man, what's up with the Red Devil?" Toji asked after he tugged Shinji to a safe distance from Asuka.  
"哟，真哥们，红魔女怎么了？" 冬二拉着真嗣走到离明日香足够远的地方后问道。

"She got hurt in a battle," Shinji sighed dejectedly.  
"她在战斗中受了伤，" 真嗣沮丧地叹息道。

Toji raised an eyebrow. He never liked the Red Devil, but hearing her got injured while protecting them, he decided he should at least show some respect. "Although she's a bi- um, selfish person in life, she deserves my respect as a warrior," he patted Shinji's shoulder.  
剑介挑了挑眉。他从来不喜欢红魔，但听说她在保护他们时受了伤，他决定至少应该表现出一些敬意。"虽然她在生活中是个，呃，自私的人，但作为战士，她值得我尊敬，"他拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。

"Thanks," Shinji smiled a small smile. "Anyway, I have to go back now. I don't want to leave her alone any longer."  
"谢谢，" 真嗣微微一笑。"无论如何，我现在得回去了。我不想让她一个人待太久。"

"Yeah, yeah. Go take care of your wife, Shin-man!" He grinned smugly.  
“是是，去照顾你老婆吧，真嗣老兄！”他得意地咧嘴笑道。

"Toji…just shut it," Shinji said in exasperation, walking back to Asuka's side and sat down on the chair on his new spot.  
“阿薰……闭嘴吧，”真嗣无奈地说，走回明日香身边，坐在新位置的椅子上。

"Rise! Bow! Sit!" Came class rep's dutiful announcement as the Sensei went into the classroom,  
“起立！敬礼！坐下！”随着老师走进教室，班长尽职地宣布道，

"Hello class, before we start today, I have an announcement to make," Nebukawa sensei adjusted his glasses. "The school planned a trip to Okinawa next week. Everybody without health issues is going."  
"同学们，在开始今天的课程之前，我有一个通知要宣布，" 碇老师调整了一下他的眼镜。"学校计划下周去冲绳旅行。所有没有健康问题的同学都会参加。"

The class exploded into cheers and applauds, momentarily shifting the center of attention from the wheelchair-riding redhead to searching for friends they could hang out with. Asuka, however, her face darkened upon hearing the news. _'Everybody without health issues…which excludes me,'_ she brooded irately. Her mood only sunk lower as she remembered that she was supposed to go back to Germany next week, which meant losing Shinji – and she didn't dare to think of what would happen next.  
班级里爆发出欢呼和掌声，一瞬间将注意力从坐在轮椅上的红发女孩转移到了寻找可以一起玩耍的朋友。然而，明日香听到这个消息后脸色阴沉下来。'所有没有健康问题的同学……这不包括我，'她愤怒地沉思着。她的心情随着想起下周她本应返回德国，这意味着要失去真嗣——她不敢想象接下来会发生什么。

Even the highly sleep-inducing lecture of pre-impact life did nothing to help sort out the turmoil of thoughts in Asuka's mind.  
即使是关于冲击前生活的催眠讲座，也丝毫没有帮助明日香理清脑海中的混乱思绪。

The lunch bell was seen as a saving grace by Asuka as she was on the edge of completely losing her composure under the stress of her dark thoughts. She had a lot on her mind that she wanted to talk about with Shinji, preferably privately, but going to the rooftop was impossible since one needed to climb stairs to get there, so the corner of the playground was the second-to-best spot they could find in school. Fortunately there was still one way she knew she could hide their conversation well. "Shinji," Asuka started as the said boy put down both of their bentos. _"What do you think about me going back to Germany?"_ She said in German.  
午餐铃声对明日香来说犹如救命稻草，她正因内心深处的阴暗思绪而濒临彻底崩溃的边缘。她有许多心事想与真嗣倾诉，最好能私下进行，但前往天台是不可能的，因为需要爬楼梯才能到达，因此学校操场的角落成了他们次佳的选择。幸运的是，她知道还有一种方法能很好地隐藏他们的对话。“真嗣，”明日香开口道，那男孩正放下两人的便当盒。“你觉得我回德国怎么样？”她用德语说道。

_"If you don't want to go back, I don't want you to leave either,"_ Shinji replied without hesitation.  
"如果你不想回去，我也不想让你离开，" 真嗣毫不犹豫地回答道。

_"Of course I don't want to go back,"_ Asuka huffed. _"I have no one back there. I'd rather…die than go back to Germany, where no one cares about me…"_ She sulked, her voice full of sorrow.  
"当然我不想回去，" 明日香气呼呼地说。"我在那里没有亲人。我宁愿……死也不愿回到德国，那里没人关心我……" 她沮丧地低声说道，声音充满了悲伤。

_"Asuka, I'm not letting you go,"_ Shinji said firmly and took hold of Asuka's hand, who initially tensed up at the sudden contact but gave in as she remembered that they had already done things much more intimate. _"I'll think of someway…"_ _'and it has a specific name',_ he thought, really hoping that his father could be useful this time.  
"明日香，我不会让你走的，" 真嗣坚定地说，并握住了明日香的手，她起初因突如其来的接触而紧张，但随即想起了他们已经做过更亲密的事情，便放松了下来。"我会想办法……" '而且它有个特定的名字'，他心想，真心希望这次他的父亲能派上用场。

Moreover, the upcoming Okinawa trip also indicated the discovery of the eighth Angel – another standing issue he needed to deal with.  
此外，即将到来的冲绳之旅也预示着第八使徒的发现——这是他需要处理的另一个悬而未决的问题。

_"I'll hold you onto that,"_ the uncertainty in Asuka's voice, however, was a stark contrast to her words. It was understandable, though. What could an Evangelion pilot do, whose rank in NERV was even lower than Misato and wasn't even in the chain of command? Nevertheless, she still held a glimmer of hope that Shinji, the person she trusted the most in the world, would keep his words. _"If you don't-"_  
“我会记住你这句话的，”但明日香的声音中透露出的不确定性与她的话形成了鲜明对比。不过，这可以理解。一个在 NERV 中级别甚至低于美里、且不在指挥链中的 EVA 驾驶员能做什么呢？尽管如此，她仍抱有一丝希望，相信她在这个世界上最信任的人——真嗣，会遵守他的承诺。“如果你不——”

Suddenly another voice came to them, interrupting Asuka's speech. "Can I join you, Shinji, Asuka?"  
突然，另一个声音打断了明日香的话。“我可以加入你们吗，真嗣，明日香？”

The said pair raised their head to see Rei Ayanami standing in front of them with a blank expression, a bento box held in her hand. Shinji had been cooking for Ayanami as well since his second cycle; after all, he couldn't stand seeing someone he considered as his half-sister living in such a low life quality. However, right now, he had a more important task at hand. "I'm sorry Ayanami, but Asuka and I are having some…private things to discuss." He replied as he saw the uncomfortable expression on Asuka's face.  
那对情侣抬起头，看到绫波零站在他们面前，面无表情，手里拿着一个便当盒。自从他的第二个循环以来，真嗣也一直在为绫波做饭；毕竟，他无法忍受看到自己视为半个妹妹的人过着如此低质量的生活。然而，现在他有一个更重要的任务在手。“对不起，绫波，但我和明日香有些…私事要讨论。”他回答道，同时注意到明日香脸上不自在的表情。

"We're all friends, are we not?" Rei said casually. "And I'm concerned with Asuka's condition, so I thought I should check on her as soon as she comes back to school, which is today. Isn't looking after each other are friends for?"  
“我们不都是朋友吗？”绫波随意地说道。“而且我对明日香的情况很关心，所以我想在她今天回学校后尽快看看她。互相照顾不就是朋友之间的责任吗？”

Asuka blinked. She never thought Rei…actually had emotions, and she…cared about her, just in her own weird way? As hard as it was for her to admit, Rei now resembled less of a doll than she initially thought. On second thought, Rei was also a pilot, which means sooner than later she would know the truth, so Asuka didn't have anything to lose for telling her. If anything, she might actually be helpful, considering how close her relationship with the Commander was. "Fine…join us if you want. But not a word to any other person!"  
明日香眨了眨眼。她从未想过绫波……真的有情感，而且……以她自己奇怪的方式关心着她？尽管难以承认，但绫波现在看起来并不像她最初认为的那样像个玩偶。再想想，绫波也是一名驾驶员，这意味着她迟早会知道真相，所以明日香告诉她也没什么损失。如果有什么的话，考虑到她和司令官的亲密关系，她可能真的会有所帮助。“好吧……如果你想加入就加入吧。但别对其他人透露一个字！”

"Friends keep each other's secrets. I am your friend, therefore I will keep your secret."  
“朋友之间保守秘密。我是你的朋友，因此我会保守你的秘密。”

"Good." Asuka sighed in relief. "Well, NERV Germany is demanding my presence, but I don't want to go back. So Shinji and I are thinking of ways to let me stay."  
"好。" 明日香松了口气。"嗯，德国的 NERV 分部要求我回去，但我不想走。所以我和真嗣正在想办法让我留下来。"

Rei's eyes widened a hair, the equivalent of a blink on ordinary people. "Why?"  
绫波的眼睛微微睁大，对于普通人来说相当于眨眼。"为什么？"

"Who the fuck knows? I guess since I can't pilot anymore, they…they…" Asuka choked on her last words, a pained expression crossed her face as she was again reminded of her uselessness.  
"谁他妈知道？大概是因为我不能再驾驶了，他们……他们……" 明日香说到最后哽咽了，痛苦的表情掠过她的脸庞，再次提醒了她自己的无用。

"Oh," Rei tilted her by a minuscule amount. "You shouldn't rely on EVA," the blue-haired girl continued. "There is happiness to be found outside of piloting them."  
"哦，" 丽轻轻地倾斜了一下她的身体。"你不应该依赖 EVA，"蓝发女孩继续说道。"在驾驶它们之外，还有幸福可以找到。"

"What was that?" Asuka hissed. "Are you just rubbing it off on my face?!"  
"那是什么？" 明日香低声咆哮。"你是在往我脸上抹吗？！"

"I am unable to bong with people without EVA," Rei continued, ignoring her outburst. "I see you have already found happiness outside of EVA. I…envy you."  
"我无法在没有 EVA 的情况下与人交往，" 丽继续说道，无视她的爆发。"我看到你已经在 EVA 之外找到了幸福。我……羡慕你。"

"You're not making any sense, wondergirl," Asuka's rage turned into confusion. "Happiness? Can't you see that I'm…very much unhappy right now?!"  
"你根本说不通，小奇迹女孩，" 明日香愤怒转为困惑，"幸福？你难道看不出来我现在……非常不开心吗？！"

"He makes you happy, doesn't he?" Ayanami glanced at Shinji.  
"他让你感到幸福，对吧？" 绫波瞥了一眼真嗣。

Asuka found herself in a speechless state. Did Shinji make her happy? Of course, she would admit that she needed him, trusted him, and felt _comfortable_ and _not lonely_ around him. But happiness? Although Shinji had said he only wanted her to be happy, she didn't think she could ever again, after that day…the day she became an Evangelion pilot, the simultaneously most happy and terrifying day of her life. "I…I don't know," she replied just above a whisper.  
明日香发现自己无言以对。真嗣让她感到幸福吗？当然，她会承认自己需要他，信任他，和他在一起感到舒适而不孤单。但幸福？尽管真嗣说过只希望她幸福，但她不认为在那一天之后自己还能再次感到幸福……那一天她成为 EVA 驾驶员，既是她一生中最快乐也是最恐怖的一天。"我……我不知道，" 她低声回答。

"It's easy to see," Rei kept using her monotone voice. "Your…light, shines when you're around him."  
“这很容易看出来，”绫波继续用她那单调的声音说，“你的……光芒，在他身边时闪耀。”

Two pairs of eyes glared at the blue-haired girl in shock. Utter failure of comprehension in Asuka's case, while Shinji couldn't believe Rei wished to disclose so much information about her origin. "Light? What the hell is that?!"  
两双眼睛震惊地瞪着蓝发女孩。明日香完全无法理解，而真嗣则不敢相信绫波愿意透露这么多关于她身世的信息。“光？那到底是什么鬼东西？！”

"It's classified." “那是机密。”

"Whatever…" Asuka rubbed her forehead, "but even if I've already found my happiness, I'm about to lose it if I don't get back into my EVA in one week!"  
“随便吧…”明日香揉了揉额头，“但即使我已经找到了我的幸福，如果一周内不能回到我的 EVA 里，我就要失去它了！”

"EVA is a mirror that reflects your heart. You need to open up yourself to it."  
“EVA 是你心灵的镜子。你需要向它敞开心扉。”

"What's there opening up to a damned machine for?"  
“对着一台该死的机器敞开心扉有什么用？”

"EVA is more than just a machine, Asuka," Rei fixed her red eyes on the girl.  
"EVA 不仅仅是一台机器，明日香，" 绫波凝视着女孩，红色的眼睛里透着坚定。

Asuka's lips turned into a thin line. More than just a machine? Then what could it be? She felt a chill ran down her spine as she recalled watching the footage of the Israfel battle. The way Unit 01 roared at the sky…machines could never do that, could they? If anything, she would say at that time Unit 01 was a raging beast.  
明日香的嘴唇抿成了一条细线。不仅仅是一台机器？那它还能是什么？她回想起观看伊斯拉斐尔战斗录像时的情景，那种脊背发凉的感觉再次袭来。零一机对着天空咆哮的样子……机器绝不可能做到那样，不是吗？如果非要形容，她会说那一刻的零一机就像一头狂怒的野兽。

It was at that moment she found Ritsuko's words extremely truthful. _'There's still so much I don't know about the EVA…'_  
就在那一刻，她觉得律子的那些话无比真实。'关于 EVA，我还有很多不了解的地方……'

On their way back to the classroom, the strange looks Asuka received only got worse – there were even groups of people who seemed to come just to take a look at her pathetic state. Shinji silently cursed since he knew the information must've spread wide across the campus to attract so many people.  
在他们返回教室的路上，明日香收到的奇怪目光愈发恶劣——甚至有成群的人似乎专程前来只为看她狼狈的样子。真嗣默默咒骂，因为他知道这消息一定已经传遍了整个校园，才能吸引这么多人围观。

Shinji could feel his heart stung as he saw Asuka's face darken with each passing second. After hearing Asuka's knuckles crack in anger, he decided that was it. "Go away!" He yelled at a group of smaller kids who were looking at Asuka giggling. Shinji raised his fist, "Go away before I-"  
看到明日香的脸色随着每一秒过去而越发阴沉，真嗣感到心痛。听到明日香因愤怒而握紧的拳头发出声响后，他决定不能再忍。“走开！”他对一群窃笑的小孩吼道。真嗣举起拳头，“走开，否则我——”

He trailed off as he felt someone tugging his shirt. "Shinji…no need. I deserve to be laughed at, don't I?" Asuka let out a sorrowful chuckle, the warm feeling she got from Shinji defending her did little to help soothe her sore mood. "I'm nothing, no one. I failed in battle, I'm a disgrace of Evangelion project…I-"  
他话音未落，感觉有人拉扯他的衬衫。“真嗣…没必要。我活该被嘲笑，不是吗？”明日香苦笑一声，真嗣为她辩护带来的温暖感觉对缓解她糟糕的心情并无多大帮助。“我什么都不是，没人关心。我在战斗中失败了，我是福音战士计划的耻辱…我——”

"**Silence**," Shinji said sternly, shutting her up in an instant. "We've had this discussion before, Asuka," his tone softened as he continued. "This," he pointed at the wheelchair. "Tell me do you see this as a symbol of your failure?" Seeing Asuka nod hesitantly, he spoke up again. "But I don't. I see this as a mark of what you've contributed to the world."  
“安静，”真嗣严肃地说道，立刻让她闭上了嘴。“我们之前讨论过这个，明日香，”他的语气在继续时变得柔和。“这个，”他指着轮椅。“告诉我，你认为这是你失败的象征吗？”看到明日香犹豫地点头，他再次开口。“但我不是。我认为这是你为这个世界所做出的贡献的标志。”

Asuka blinked in confusion and surprise. "What are you talking about?"  
明日香困惑又惊讶地眨了眨眼。“你在说什么？”

"You might have been defeated by the Angel, but you didn't fail, Asuka," Shinji knelt down beside her wheelchair, so now he was looking up to her. "You and Ayanami weakened the Angel and found its weakness so that I could defeat it. I would've never been able to defeat it by myself." It was a lie he needed to say at the moment. "Whenever I see it, I think of your indispensable contribution to the battle, not…other things."  
"你或许被使徒打败了，但你并没有失败，明日香，" 真嗣跪在她轮椅旁，现在他是仰视着她。"你和绫波削弱了使徒并找到了它的弱点，我才能击败它。我一个人是绝对做不到的。" 这是他此刻需要说出的谎言。"每当我看到它，我想到的是你在战斗中不可或缺的贡献，而不是……其他事情。"

"You…really think that?" Asuka asked with hope that filled her voice, her blue eyes beaming in surprise.  
"你……真的这么想？" 明日香带着满怀希望的声音问道，她的蓝眼睛因惊讶而闪烁。

"Of course. You're not useless, Asuka," Shinji reassured. "Who cares what those imbeciles think? All people in NERV will remember what you did for the whole world."  
"当然。你不是无用的，明日香，" 真嗣安慰道。"那些蠢货怎么想谁在乎？NERV 的所有人都会记得你为全世界所做的一切。"

Asuka relaxed in the wheelchair, a small smile crept up her face. She didn't care about whether or not other people pitied her anymore. She realized that just like the praises she got from them before, they were all empty without real meaning behind them. Maybe people would forget about her, perhaps even NERV employees would forget about her, but she still had value as long as Shinji was by her side. It was probably only a tiny, even temporary victory of her bright side, but a victory nonetheless.  
明日香坐在轮椅上放松下来，一丝微笑悄悄爬上她的脸庞。她不再在意别人是否还对她抱有同情。她意识到，就像之前从他们那里得到的赞美一样，这些都毫无意义，背后没有真正的内涵。也许人们会忘记她，甚至 NERV 的员工也会忘记她，但只要真嗣在她身边，她依然有价值。这或许只是她光明面的一次微小甚至暂时的胜利，但胜利终究是胜利。

**Chapter 14: Everything I Do  
第十四章：我所做的一切**

Shinji entered Gendo Ikari's office with a complex of emotions, even the dark room's chilling environment didn't help put out the supernova inside his chest. "I'll be straight to the point, father," he started as soon as Gendo came into a talking distance. "There's no way Asuka's going back to Germany."  
真嗣带着复杂的情绪走进碇源堂的办公室，即便是昏暗房间的阴冷环境也无法平息他胸中如超新星爆发般的情感。“我会直截了当地说，父亲，”他一等碇源堂走近便开口道，“无论如何，明日香都不会回德国。”

"I understand," Gendo replied calmly. "However, the politics in here is delicate. Technically NERV Japan and NERV Germany are at the same level in terms of jurisdiction. We can't interfere with their decisions. However," he added before Shinji could say anything, "I will try to negotiate with them. Other than that, there's not much I can do, except you could try to destroy NERV Germany branch with Unit 01."  
"我明白，" 碇源堂平静地回答。"不过，这里的政治局势很微妙。从技术上讲，NERV 日本和 NERV 德国在管辖权上是平级的。我们不能干涉他们的决定。不过，" 他没等真嗣开口就补充道，"我会尝试与他们谈判。除此之外，我能做的并不多，除非你打算用初号机摧毁 NERV 德国支部。"

"I probably will if it comes to that," said Shinji half-jokingly. "If she's under normal conditions…I could've accepted it. But now she's as good as dead if we send her back. And you know what happens then."  
"如果真到了那一步，我可能会这么做，" 真嗣半开玩笑地说。"如果她处于正常状态…我或许能接受。但现在送她回去，她几乎等于死路一条。而且你知道那会发生什么。"

"Is that a threat?" Gendo narrowed his eyes by a hair, hid by the colored glasses.  
"这是威胁吗？" 碇源堂微微眯起眼睛，被有色眼镜遮住了。

"I'm just stating the reality," Shinji retorted.  
“我只是陈述现实，”真嗣反驳道。

"I see." Gendo fell silent for a moment. He would've done anything to get Yui back, even at the cost of the whole world. In a way, Shinji resembled a lot like himself, so he didn't doubt that there's a high chance that he would actually destroy NERV Germany if anything happened to the Second Child there. "I'll see what I can do."  
“我明白了。”碇源堂沉默了一会儿。为了找回唯，他愿意付出整个世界的代价。某种程度上，真嗣和他非常相似，所以他毫不怀疑，如果第二适格者在德国发生任何事，真嗣真的可能会摧毁德国 NERV。“我会看看能做些什么。”

"Father, no matter how much I hate it, we're in this together," Shinji added in a softer tone. "If we cooperate more, in the end, we both get what we want. A win-win situation."  
"父亲，无论我多么讨厌这一点，我们都是一条船上的人，" 真嗣用更柔和的语气补充道。"如果我们更多地合作，最终我们都能得到我们想要的。双赢的局面。"

"That is correct," Gendo said, his hands kept clasping together under his chin. "That means you should make more of your contribution as well."  
"没错，" 碇源堂说道，他的双手始终在下巴下交握。"这意味着你也应该做出更多的贡献。"

"Sure, how about some intel of the next Angel?" A smirk crept up his face. "Go search inside Mount Asama. Don't do anything yet, I have my own plan to defeat it…harmlessly."  
"当然，关于下一个使徒的情报怎么样？" 他脸上浮现出一丝得意的笑容。"去榛名山内部搜寻一下吧。先别行动，我自有办法无害地击败它……"

"I'm listening." Gendo perked up his ears.  
"我在听着。" 源度竖起了耳朵。

"Throw an N2 mine into the mountain. Don't try to capture it, because we don't have proper EVA Units to do the job now that Unit 02 is inoperational," said Shinji with a note of sadness in his voice. "I'll wait outside of blast radius…the Angel will come out of the mountain, and I'll kill it on the ground. Much safer than diving into the volcano."  
"向山中投掷一枚 N2 地雷。不要试图捕获它，因为我们现在没有合适的 EVA 单位来执行任务，02 号机已经无法运作了。" 真嗣的声音中带着一丝悲伤。"我会在爆炸范围外等待……天使会从山中出来，我会在地面上将其击杀。这比潜入火山要安全得多。"

"Understood. I will inform the tactical division about it when they found the Angel," Gendo Ikari replied. "Anything else?"  
"明白了。战术部门发现天使后，我会通知他们。还有其他事吗？" 碇源堂回答道。"

"No. Not for now, father."  
"没有了。暂时没有，父亲。"

"Alright. Dismissed." "好了，解散。"

Gendo Ikari sat on his office chair as he watched Shinji leave the room. He could very well relate to his own son in such a situation. If he was Shinji, and Asuka was Yui…  
碇源堂坐在他的办公椅上，看着真嗣离开房间。在这种情况下，他完全能理解自己的儿子。如果他是真嗣，而明日香是唯……

A decision was made. Gendo picked up the landline on the side of the table and dialed the number of the head of the Germany branch. "William Schmidt here." The voice of the leader of NERV Germany came through the speaker.  
一个决定已经做出。碇源堂拿起桌边的座机，拨打了德国分部负责人的号码。"威廉·施密特在此。"NERV 德国分部领导人的声音从扬声器中传来。

"Gendo Ikari," Gendo spoke into the microphone in a freezing voice, sending shivers ran down William's spine. "I've been informed that the German branch is demanding the presence of the Second Child. Explain."  
"碇源堂，" 源度用冰冷的语气对着麦克风说道，让威廉的脊背一阵发凉。"我被告知德国分部要求第二适格者的到场。解释一下。"

"Well, commander," William tried to keep his calm composure under the uncanny stress Gendo was weighing on him, but he might as well try to endure the weight of Mount Everest. "She's no longer useful to the Evangelion Project, but considering her expertise in biology and mathematics, we deem-"  
"嗯，指挥官，" 威廉试图在源度施加的诡异压力下保持冷静，但他或许还不如尝试承受珠穆朗玛峰的重量。"她对福音战士计划已不再有用，但考虑到她在生物学和数学方面的专长，我们认为——"

"Pilot Soryu is still a reserve pilot, so she's still under NERV Japan's jurisdiction," Gendo cut him off in a stern voice that left no room for negotiations. "Is that understood?"  
“飞行员惣流仍然是预备役，所以她仍归 NERV 日本管辖，”碇源堂用一种不容商榷的严厉语气打断了他，“明白了吗？”

"But she's NERV Germany's property, technically we could-"  
"但她从技术上讲是 NERV 德国的财产，理论上我们可以——"

"Doctor Ritsuko Akagi still needs her presence in NERV HQ, and as the head of Project E, her power overrides yours under this situation." Gendo Ikari remembered a document Dr. Akagi had sent him days ago about doing some necessary tests on the Second Child to find a solution to her problem, which now became handy.  
"Dr. Ritsuko Akagi 在 NERV 总部仍需要她的存在，作为 E 计划负责人，在这种情況下她的权力凌驾于你之上。" Gendo Ikari 想起了几天前 Dr. Akagi 发给他的一份文件，关于对二号适格者进行一些必要测试以解决她的问题，现在这变得很有用。

"Wait, I didn't see the official document," it was a small wonder William still dared to shot back.  
"等等，我没看到正式文件，" William 居然还敢反驳，真是令人惊讶。

Gendo Ikari huffed. He took out the request form and sighed on it. "From now on, it's officially an order. You will receive the document tomorrow."  
碇源堂哼了一声，拿出申请表叹了口气，“从现在起，这正式成为一项命令。你明天会收到文件。”

The commander of NERV waited patiently for a reply. After a long pause on William's side, a _defeated_ voice finally came to him. "Understood."  
NERV 的指挥官耐心等待着回复。在威廉那边长时间的沉默后，一个沮丧的声音终于传了过来，“明白了。”

A slight smirk crept up his face as Gendo hanged up the phone. No one would mess with his scenario and impede his reunion with Yui.  
一丝冷笑爬上了他的脸庞，当源渡挂断电话时。没有人能干扰他的剧本，阻碍他与唯的重逢。

_"Baka. Don't go overboard." Asuka's grateful voice echoed through Shinji's cockpit, who had his EVA holding an iron grip on the crimson EVA Unit. "How are you going to survive this without a D-type equipment?"  
"笨蛋。别太过火了。" 明日香感激的声音在真嗣的驾驶舱中回响，他的 EVA 正紧紧抓住那台红色的 EVA 二号机。"没有 D 型装备，你打算怎么活下来？"_

_"Hadn't thought that far. But if the battery runs out, the muscle will still lock on." Came Shinji's dispassionate response. No matter what, he would NOT let her fall.  
"还没想那么远。但如果电池耗尽，肌肉还是会锁定。" 真嗣冷漠地回应。无论如何，他绝不会让她坠落。_

_What happened next, though registered by his eyes, he still refused to believe it. The coolant pipes he gripped on that were connected with Unit 02 snapped, and the crimson behemoth in white armor promptly started falling down.  
尽管接下来发生的事情被他的眼睛捕捉到了，他仍然拒绝相信。他紧握的与二号机相连的冷却管道断裂了，那台身披白色盔甲的红色巨兽随即开始坠落。_

_"NO! Asuka!" Shinji screamed, but there was nothing he could do except watching the love of his life falling deeper and deeper into the red abyss of death.  
“不！明日香！”真嗣尖叫着，但他除了眼睁睁看着心爱的人不断坠入死亡的红色深渊外，别无他法。_

_"Shinji! Don't let me go! Don't leave me! I don't wanna die! Please Shinji, don't-" Asuka's desperate cries pierced his heart like a sharp sword. What went wrong? Just how many times had he pulled her from the same deadly bottomless pit? "Misato-san! Please send me down!" He opened a second comm channel to the temporary command center, the extreme despair in his voice pulled the heartstrings of everyone that heard him. "I can't lose Asuka!"  
“真嗣！别放开我！别离开我！我不想死！求你了，真嗣，不要——”明日香绝望的呼喊如利剑般刺穿他的心。究竟哪里出了错？他曾多少次将她从那致命的无底深渊中拉回？“美里小姐！请送我下去！”他打开第二通讯频道，向临时指挥中心求救，声音中的极度绝望牵动了每一个听到他声音的人的心弦。“我不能失去明日香！”_

_"I'm sorry, Shinji, but we can't lose a second pilot," Katsuragi's calm voice sounded over the comms, fueling Shinji's determination.  
“对不起，真嗣，但我们不能失去第二个驾驶员，”葛城美里平静的声音通过通讯传来，激发了真嗣的决心。_

_"Understood." The sudden shift of his tone chilled the bones of everyone in the command center.  
“明白了。”他语气的突然转变让指挥中心内的每个人都感到骨寒。_

_Then he let go of his grasp on the coolant pipes that were pulling him up. Following Unit 02, the purple EVA Unit went down the sea of molten rocks.  
随后，他松开了紧握冷却管的手，这些管道正将他向上拉。紧随二号机之后，紫色 EVA 单位坠入了熔岩之海。_

_If Asuka's no more…then he wanted nothing from this world anymore.  
如果明日香不在了……那么他对这个世界再无所求。_

Asuka Langley Soryu's eyes cracked open, smiling as she felt the warmth of another body wrapped around her like a big spoon, though for some reason, her left hand was aching. For the last few days, they'd always fell asleep in such a position, to a point she had already been getting used to it. Even though the idea scared her – she should be independent and rely on nobody – Asuka still didn't want to give up the warmth and comfort of sleeping next to _Shinji._  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷的眼睛缓缓睁开，感受到另一具身体像大勺子一样环绕着她，带来温暖，尽管不知为何她的左手隐隐作痛。最近几天，他们总是以这样的姿势入睡，以至于她已经习惯了。尽管这个想法让她害怕——她应该是独立的，不依赖任何人——但明日香仍然不想放弃睡在真嗣身边的温暖和舒适。

A glance at the clock told her it was 4 in the morning. Asuka frowned since normally only nightmares would cause her to wake up so early, while the dream she just had – she and Shinji massacring a horde of human-sized Angels with shining swords and armor – was one of the best dreams she had recently.  
看了一眼时钟，她发现现在是凌晨四点。明日香皱起眉头，因为通常只有噩梦才会让她这么早醒来，而她刚刚做的梦——她和真嗣挥舞着闪亮的剑和盔甲，屠杀一群人形使徒——却是她近期做过的最好的梦之一。

Then why did she wake up so early?  
那她为什么这么早就醒了？

As the haziness of her brain slowly subsided, she could feel the _aching_ of her left hand quickly became _painful._ She looked down at her hand and saw Shinji had a vice-like grip on her fingers, his fingernails digging into her palm.  
随着大脑的迷糊逐渐消退，她能感觉到左手的疼痛迅速加剧。她低头看向自己的手，发现真嗣像钳子一样紧紧抓住她的手指，指甲深深嵌入她的手掌。

As much as Asuka liked physical contact with Shinji, he was now _hurting_ her. Asuka let out a low yelp of pain as his grasp suddenly increased in strength. She never knew Shinji, who looked thin and weak, possessed so much muscle power, nor did she understand why he was holding her so forcefully to the point that it hurt.  
尽管明日香喜欢与真嗣的肢体接触，但他现在弄疼了她。随着他的握力突然增强，明日香发出一声低沉的痛呼。她从未意识到看似瘦弱无力的真嗣竟有如此强大的肌肉力量，也不明白他为何要如此用力地抓着她，以至于让她感到疼痛。

She took a look at his peaceful face and confirmed his sleeping status, which created more confusion. People said dreams were a continuation of reality…so was this Shinji's way of saying, 'I'm not letting you go?' Although the thought fluttered her heart, the pain induced by his grip quickly wiped out all positive feelings. Asuka silently cursed since she knew if she didn't get out of this grasp soon her hand was going to bruise badly. She waited for his grip to loosen and took the opportunity; with a forceful pull, she got rid of his iron lock, shaking her hand to relax the sore flesh.  
她瞥了一眼他平静的面容，确认了他的睡眠状态，这反而增添了更多困惑。人们常说梦境是现实的延续……那么这是否意味着真嗣在用这种方式表达，‘我不会让你离开’？尽管这个念头让她的心微微颤动，但他的紧握带来的疼痛迅速抹去了所有积极的感受。明日香默默地咒骂着，因为她知道如果再不挣脱这个束缚，她的手将会严重瘀伤。她等待着他的握力放松，抓住机会；用力一拉，她摆脱了他的铁钳，摇晃着手以缓解酸痛的肌肉。

Asuka blinked as she saw the sudden shift of expression on Shinji's face. The relaxed look he had on his face before she pulled her hand out darkened instantly, and his face contorted, "No…' suka…" he mumbled, starting to twitch and turn in his sleep.  
明日香眨了眨眼，看到真嗣脸上的表情突然转变。在她抽出手之前，他脸上的放松表情瞬间变得阴沉，他的脸扭曲着，“不……明日香……”他喃喃自语，开始在睡梦中抽搐和翻转。

Suddenly Shinji's arm shot upward, waving in the air. Asuka fixed her gaze on the feebly waving hand; was he reaching out for something? Her college-graduate level brain wasted no time finding the answer before a look of shame crossed her face. But his grip was hurting her, otherwise she would've stayed in that way. Still-  
突然，真嗣的手臂猛地向上挥动，在空中无力地挥舞。明日香凝视着那只微弱挥动的手；他是在寻找什么吗？她的大学毕业生级别的大脑毫不费力地找到了答案，但随即脸上掠过一丝羞愧。但他的握力让她疼痛，否则她会那样待着。尽管如此——

"I 'an't los' 'suka…" Another mumble reached her ears, snapping her out of her train of thoughts. Did Shinji just… Asuka shook her head. Just how much did she mean to him? What about the other girl Shinji mentioned before? She found it was impossible to answer these questions, yet there was one thing she could do at the moment.  
"我不能失去你，伙伴……" 又一声含糊的话语传入她的耳中，打断了她的思绪。难道真嗣刚刚……明日香摇了摇头。她对他来说到底有多重要？那他之前提到的另一个女孩呢？她发现这些问题无法回答，但有一件事她现在可以做。

_"Sometimes emotional support is much more important than physical ones."  
"有时候，情感支持远比物质上的更为重要。"_

With a determined look in her eyes, Asuka snapped out her right hand and grabbed Shinji's. Although it was almost crushed in his immediate iron grip, Asuka gritted her teeth and endured the pain. Compared to what Shinji had done for her, a little…discomfort was nothing.  
眼中闪过坚定的光芒，明日香猛地伸出右手抓住了真嗣的手。尽管他的铁钳般的握力几乎让她感到剧痛，明日香咬紧牙关忍耐着。与真嗣为她所做的一切相比，这点……不适根本不算什么。

"Shinji… it's okay… I'm right here… I'm not leaving…" She whispered into his ears; slowly she could feel Shinji relax with each passing second, his grasp on her hand loosened in strength as well. Asuka's lips curled up a bit as she saw the expression on Shinji's face gradually returned to the previous peaceful state; just this time it also had a hint of a smile in it.  
“真嗣…没事的…我就在这儿…不会离开的…”她轻声细语地在他耳边呢喃；渐渐地，她能感觉到真嗣随着每一秒过去而放松下来，他紧握她手的力道也减弱了。明日香看到真嗣脸上的表情逐渐恢复到之前的平静状态，只是这次还带着一丝微笑，她的嘴角不禁微微上扬。

Even though he said he needed nothing from her, she still found a way to help him, and she was _happy_ that she could reciprocate his effort.  
尽管他说不需要她的任何东西，她还是找到了帮助他的方法，并且她很高兴能够回报他的努力。

For the first time since the battle against the seventh Angel, Asuka felt a note of pride for herself. It was substantial evidence that she was still useful, in her own way.  
自从与第七使徒的战斗以来，明日香第一次为自己感到一丝骄傲。这充分证明了她仍然有她自己的价值。

"Sleep well, Baka-Shinji," Asuka whispered into his ear one last time and lay down back on her bed, smiling herself to sleep.  
“睡个好觉，笨蛋真嗣。”明日香最后一次在他耳边低语，然后躺回自己的床上，微笑着进入梦乡。

"200 meters…300 meters…" "200 米…300 米…"

The atmosphere in the research lab near Mount Asama had been tense ever since Captain Katsuragi had arrived. Although the woman was messy at home, she could be formal and professional when needed.  
自从桂木队长来到位于浅间山附近的研究实验室后，气氛就一直很紧张。虽然这位女士在家里不修边幅，但必要时她可以非常正式和专业。

They had been descending an unmanned drone into the pool of magma, hoping to find the source that was causing the disruption in the magma flow under Mount Asama. However, they hadn't found anything yet; and the drone was approaching dangerous depths.  
他们一直在将一架无人驾驶飞行器下降到岩浆池中，希望能找到导致浅间山下岩浆流紊乱的源头。然而，他们至今一无所获；而无人机正接近危险的深度。

"Captain Katsuragi," The lead scientist spoke up as he watched the altitude of the drone continue to drop more and more. "This drone will never be able to withstand the pressures you plan on putting it through."  
"葛城队长," 首席科学家在观察无人机高度持续下降时开口说道，"这台无人机根本无法承受您计划中的压力。"

"If we destroy it, then NERV will pay for a new one." She said in an indifferent tone.  
"如果我们毁了它，NERV 会出钱买新的。" 她用一种漠不关心的语气说道。"

"Maximum safety depth reached." The young research announced.  
"达到最大安全深度。" 年轻的研究员宣布道。"

"Continue the descend." Misato's gaze never moved a bit from the screen.  
“继续下潜。”美里目光始终未曾从屏幕上移开。

Moments later, a loud crack of metal was heard, and Misato gritted her teeth. They just needed to go a little bit farther down. The drone finally reached the depth that Misato wanted, and just at that moment, another loud crack was heard, and the video feed was severed.  
片刻后，一声金属断裂的巨响传来，美里咬紧牙关。他们只需再深入一点。无人机终于到达了美里所需的深度，就在此时，又一声巨响传来，视频信号被切断了。

"The drone has been destroyed." One of the engineers announced in comms.  
“无人机已被摧毁。”通讯中一名工程师宣布道。

"Did you get the photo?" Misato turned her head toward the screen that the technician was looking at.  
"你拿到照片了吗？" 美里转向技术人员正在查看的屏幕。

"Yeah." On the screen was a picture of what looked like a skeletal embryo of some sort. "The scan reads pattern blue." He swallowed hard, "It's an Angel."  
"嗯。" 屏幕上显示着一张看似某种骸骨胚胎的图片。"扫描结果显示为蓝色模式。" 他艰难地咽了口唾沫，"这是一只使徒。"

Misato took a deep breath and stood straight. "Everyone, this laboratory is now officially under the jurisdiction of NERV!" She announced, "This facility is to be locked down. No one is to get in or out! And anything that happens here is to be declared confidential!"  
美里深吸一口气，站直了身子。"所有人注意，这个实验室现在正式归 NERV 管辖！" 她宣布道，"该设施将被封锁。任何人不得进出！这里发生的一切都将被列为机密！"

EVA Unit 01 stood on the ground several miles away from Mount Asama, its pilot looking up at the sky where dozens of bombers were flying around, leaving stripes of white contrails behind them. The roar of the aircraft jet engines spread far away, declaring their hegemony of the sky.  
EVA 初号机矗立在距离浅间山数英里外的地面上，其驾驶员抬头望向天空，那里有数十架轰炸机盘旋着，留下一道道白色的尾迹。飞机喷气发动机的轰鸣声远远传开，宣告着它们对天空的统治。

Shinji Ikari leaned back on his pilot seat, patiently waiting for the operation to start. One of his worst nightmares was watching Asuka sink into the deadly abyss of Mount Asama; although he never failed to pull her out of death's door, he couldn't help but get anxious every time he waited beside the caldera while watching Unit 02 go down the molten pit.  
碇真嗣靠在驾驶座上，耐心等待行动开始。他最可怕的噩梦之一就是看着明日香沉入浅间山致命的深渊；尽管他从未失手将她从死神手中救出，但每次在火山口旁等待，看着 02 号机坠入熔岩深坑时，他都不禁感到焦虑。

He shook his head, trying to get rid of unhelpful recollected images of last night's bad dream. Even though he knew it was only a nightmare, the dream was too real to ignore. Only from the dreams he learned how grim the situation was every time he went down there to save her – one misstep and it would all be over.  
他摇了摇头，试图摆脱昨晚噩梦中那些无益的回忆。尽管他知道那只是一场梦，但梦境太过真实，无法忽视。正是在这些梦中，他了解到每次下去救她时情况有多么严峻——一步走错，一切都将结束。

Fortunately, this time Asuka was at a safe spot – the command deck in NERV HQ, observing the battle along with Misato and bridge bunnies. Shinji took a few deep breaths in LCL, preparing himself for the incoming fight.  
幸运的是，这次明日香在一个安全的地方——NERV 总部的指挥甲板，与美里和桥上的工作人员一起观察战斗。真嗣在 LCL 中深呼吸几次，为即将到来的战斗做准备。

"N2 depth charges drop ETA 10 seconds. All units stand by."  
“N2 深水炸弹投放倒计时 10 秒。各单位准备。”

At the moment, through enhanced vision monitor Shinji could see a small object falling down from one of the bombers, shining as the sunlight reflected on its metal exterior. The free-falling N2 depth charge plummeted into the caldera with a terminal speed of nearly 200 meters per second, raising a column of magma as it struck the lake of molten rock. As the depth charge sunk deeper and deeper into the mountain, the pressure around the firing pin quickly built up to the threshold.  
此刻，通过增强视觉监视器，真嗣可以看到一个小物体从其中一架轰炸机上坠落，阳光在其金属外壳上反射出光芒。自由落体的 N2 深水炸弹以近每秒 200 米的末速度冲入火山口，撞击熔岩湖时激起了一柱岩浆。随着深水炸弹深入山体，周围的压力迅速积累到触发引信的阈值。

With a blinding flash of light, Shinji temporarily lost all his information feed as the EMP wave caused by the blast swept across the area. Nuking a volcano was a dangerous thing to do, to say the least, and no one had ever done it before, so for safety reasons all personnel within a 100 miles radius was evacuated, leaving only Unit 01, Unit 00, and an unmanned power station on the site. The purple EVA Unit and the blue EVA Unit both uncurled their AT-Fields, blocking the incoming shockwave.  
随着一道刺眼的闪光，真嗣暂时失去了所有信息反馈，因为爆炸产生的电磁脉冲波横扫了整个区域。可以说，对火山进行核打击是极其危险的行为，而且从未有人尝试过，因此出于安全考虑，方圆 100 英里内的人员都被疏散，现场仅留下 01 号机、00 号机和一个无人发电站。紫色 EVA 和蓝色 EVA 都展开了 AT 力场，阻挡迎面而来的冲击波。

After the electronic interference and the blinding light subsided, Shinji could get a good view of the aftermath. The entire cone of the volcano was utterly wiped out, leaving a gigantic smoking crater on the ground. Huge columns of magma shot up to the air and splashed across the land nearby, flaming the sky, shaking the ground.  
电子干扰和刺眼光芒消退后，真嗣终于能清楚地看到后果。整个火山锥彻底被夷为平地，留下一个巨大的冒烟弹坑。炽热的岩浆柱冲天而起，溅落在附近的土地上，点燃了天空，震撼着大地。

"I'm reading some strange seismic activities," Shinji reported as he saw the warning messages on the panel. As if aroused by his words, a distorted roar hit him through his neural link with the EVA, sending chills down his spine. He had never heard Sandalphon shriek like this ever before. He could only hope it was not a bad sign.  
“我检测到一些异常的地震活动，”真嗣报告道，他注意到控制面板上的警告信息。仿佛被他的话所触发，一声扭曲的咆哮通过他与 EVA 的神经连接冲击着他，令他脊背发凉。他从未听过桑达尔丰如此尖叫。他只能希望这不是什么坏兆头。

With a loud noise of explosion an enormous silhouette leaped out from the crater into the air, its shape easily recognizable as Sandalphon. The weird thing was its skin seemed darker than he remembered, and it didn't even raise its AT-Field. Shinji shook his thoughts off and pulled out his prog knife specifically designed to cut through heavy armor, and entered combat stance. With Unit 00 by his side and all the air support he got, fighting Sandalphon on _land_ would be an easy task to do.  
随着一声爆炸巨响，一个庞大的身影从弹坑中跃入空中，其形状很容易辨认出是桑达尔丰。奇怪的是，它的皮肤似乎比他记忆中的更暗，而且甚至没有展开 AT 力场。真嗣甩开这些念头，拔出专门用于切割重装甲的程序刀，进入战斗姿态。有零号机在旁和所有空中支援，在陆地上对付桑达尔丰将是一项轻松的任务。

Or at least he thought so.  
至少他是这么认为的。

Asuka kept her eyes focused on the big screen that was displaying the battle, recorded by one of the VTOLs on site. As a reserve pilot she wasn't sorting, not that she could pilot her EVA even if they put her in an entry plug. Still, she wanted to be helpful in some way, so she thought observing the battle and coming up with ideas that might help would be the best choice.  
明日香将目光锁定在大屏幕上，屏幕上正播放着现场一架垂直起降飞机录制的战斗画面。作为后备飞行员，她并未参与战斗，即便让她进入插入栓，她也驾驶不了她的 EVA。尽管如此，她仍想以某种方式提供帮助，因此她认为观察战斗并提出可能有助于战局的建议是最佳选择。

From the screen, she could see the Angel slowly creeping across the land like a reptile, in a…very much not graceful manner. She felt a note of jealousy firing up inside her chest. From the looks of it, the Angel was a weak one – it didn't even have an AT-Field! She doubted even the normally-useless UN military forces could kill it just as quickly. It's basically a free kill for Shinji and wondergirl. Why did Israfel come before this one? Why did Shinji and wondergirl get to face a feeble Angel, while she had to fight the strongest one so far and get utterly destroyed?  
从屏幕上，她能看到使徒像爬行动物一样缓慢地横穿大地，那种姿态……实在谈不上优雅。她感到一丝嫉妒在胸中燃起。从外表看，这个使徒相当弱小——它甚至没有 AT 力场！她怀疑即使是平时无能的联合国军队也能迅速将其消灭。这基本上是给真嗣和那个女孩的免费击杀。为什么伊斯拉斐尔会在这个使徒之前出现？为什么真嗣和那个女孩能面对一个虚弱的使徒，而她却不得不对抗迄今为止最强的那个并被彻底摧毁？

Nevertheless, she decided she didn't need to brood on such trivial things right now.  
尽管如此，她决定现在不必为这些琐事烦恼。

Asuka shook the unhelpful thoughts off and focused on the battle. From the video feed she saw Unit 00 raise a pallet rifle and fired. The 406 mm Armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot rounds flew across the air, heading toward the eighth Angel at sonic speeds. Asuka expected the Angel to raise its AT-Field to block the deadly shells; she knew even though the Angels were extraterrestrial existence, they were still made out of flesh and blood. Without the protection of AT-Fields they were nothing but fishes on a chopping board.  
明日香甩开这些无益的想法，专注于战斗。从视频中她看到零号机举起一个托盘式步枪并开火。406 毫米穿甲尾翼稳定脱壳弹以超音速飞向第八使徒。明日香预计使徒会升起它的 AT 力场来阻挡这些致命的炮弹；她知道尽管使徒是外星存在，但它们仍然是血肉之躯。没有 AT 力场的保护，它们不过是砧板上的鱼肉。

However, she couldn't believe what she saw next. The depleted-uranium shells that could easily penetrate several meters of homogeneous steel like paper ricocheted off its dark skin harmlessly, not so much as leaving a small scratch.  
然而，接下来的一幕让她难以置信。那些能轻易穿透数米厚均质钢板如纸般的贫铀弹，却在那漆黑皮肤的表面无害地弹开，连一丝微小的划痕都未留下。

Asuka frowned. The Angel seemed to have firmer skin than she thought…  
明日香皱起眉头。这使徒的皮肤似乎比她想象的还要坚硬……

Then she could see several B-52 bombers dropping dozens of bunker busters from 20000 feet high; those newest MOPs could break through up to 60 meters of steel and concrete, while the Angel had a height of merely 50 meters when its creeping. Therefore, she was totally expecting the missiles to pierce through the Angel from top to bottom.  
随后，她看到几架 B-52 轰炸机从两万英尺高空投下数十枚钻地弹；这些最新的 MOPs 能穿透多达 60 米的钢混结构，而使徒匍匐时的高度不过 50 米。因此，她完全期待着导弹能从上至下贯穿使徒。

So when the bunker busters hit the target and didn't even detonate before smashing themselves into thousand of pieces, Asuka felt a cold ball growing inside her stomach.  
所以当那些钻地炸弹击中目标，甚至在引爆前就自行粉碎成千片时，明日香感到一股寒意在胃中蔓延。

"The fuzes of our missiles shattered upon hitting the Angel," Aoba reported in an unbelieving voice. "The Angel must have a stronger armor than we thought."  
“我们的导弹在击中使徒时，引信就破碎了，”青叶用难以置信的语气报告，“使徒的装甲一定比我们预想的更强。”

"I get it now!" Ritsuko exclaimed. "The intense heat in the volcano must've adjusted its molecular structure!"  
“我明白了！”律子惊呼，“火山中的高温一定调整了它的分子结构！”

Asuka raised her eyebrows as the realization dawned on her. If the Angel could endure the extreme heat and pressure inside the volcano, then some pathetic AP shells or bunker busters would look like a five-finger exercise in comparison. She watched in dread as Unit 01 wielded its upgraded prog knife, charging toward the Angel. The purple EVA Unit leaped into the sky and brought the knife down onto its enemy.  
明日香扬起眉毛，意识到这一点时，她的心情沉重。如果使徒能承受火山内部的极端高温和压力，那么那些可怜的 AP 弹或碉堡破坏者相比之下就像五指练习一样简单。她恐惧地看着 01 号机挥舞着升级后的程序刀，向使徒冲去。紫色的 EVA 单位一跃而起，将刀劈向敌人。

With a loud sound of clank, the knife broke into pieces upon contact.  
随着一声清脆的撞击声，刀在接触的瞬间碎裂成片。

Asuka felt her blood freeze.  
明日香感到血液凝固。

Shinji looked at the broken prog knife in his hand incredulously, dripping sweat like a rainstorm. He was aware that Sandalphon had a hard surface; he even brought the enhanced prog knife that he was sure could break through the Angel's skin, or at least do moderate damage on it. The calculation done on MAGI couldn't lie; he even surpassed MAGI's recommendation by a few notches just to make sure. But not so much as leaving a scratch?  
真嗣难以置信地看着手中断裂的程序刀，汗水如暴雨般滴落。他知道桑达尔夫的表面坚硬无比；他甚至带上了那把确信能穿透使徒皮肤的强化程序刀，或者至少能对其造成中等程度的伤害。MAGI 的计算不会说谎；他甚至超过了 MAGI 推荐的几个档次，只为确保万无一失。但连一丝划痕都没留下？

He felt his blood run dry as he realized his negligence.  
他意识到自己的疏忽，感到血液仿佛凝固了。

The N2 depth charge. N2 深水炸弹。

Of course, the knife could hurt a Sandalphon which had adjusted to a volcanic environment. But this time, it survived at the epicenter of an explosion as powerful as a nuclear strike. It didn't even need something so mundane as an AT-Field.  
当然，这把刀能伤害到一个已经适应了火山环境的桑达风。但这次，它在一个威力堪比核打击的爆炸中心存活了下来。它甚至不需要像 AT 力场这样平凡的东西。

Unfortunately, he didn't have the coolant to thermal-expansion the Angel this time.  
不幸的是，这次他没有冷却剂来热膨胀这个使徒了。

He became overconfident with all of his foreknowledge, didn't he? Now the butterfly effect was backfiring at him at full power.  
他因为所有的先知先觉而变得过于自信，不是吗？现在蝴蝶效应正以全力反噬他。

Shinji gritted his teeth and pushed the controls forward.  
真嗣咬紧牙关，向前推动操纵杆。

Asuka watched the battle dripping cold sweat as the Angel was gaining the upper hand in every possible way. She saw Unit 01 got thrown away and slammed hard on a nearby hill. She saw the bombers and VTOLs dropping and firing everything they've got and not causing so much as a scratch. She gasped as Unit 00 pull out its prog knife and charge at the Angel before immediately defeated by a vicious swing of the tail of the Angel.  
明日香看着战斗，冷汗直流，因为使徒在各个方面都占据了上风。她看到初号机被扔出去，重重地撞在附近的小山上。她看到轰炸机和垂直起降机倾泻所有火力，却连一点擦伤都没造成。她倒吸一口凉气，只见零号机拔出进度刀，冲向使徒，却立刻被使徒的尾巴猛烈一击击败。

"Unit 00 has gone silent," Maya reported in a shaky voice.  
「零号机已无回应。」摩耶用颤抖的声音报告道。

Her eyes went wide as she saw Unit 01's readings went crazy. "Pilot Ikari's sync rate is spiking! Ninety-seven percent!" The jealousy of his sync rate only appeared as a dim afterthought.  
当她看到 01 号机的读数疯狂飙升时，她的眼睛瞪大了。"碇真嗣的同步率在飙升！百分之九十七！"对他同步率的嫉妒只在一瞬间闪过。

Asuka felt shivers ran down her spine as she heard the bone-chilling roar coming from Unit 01. She felt her anxiety soothed a bit, knowing how powerful the EVA would become under this state. She prepared herself to enjoy the slaughter.  
明日香感到一阵寒意沿着脊椎蔓延，当她听到零一机传来的令人毛骨悚然的咆哮时。她感到一丝焦虑被缓解，知道在这种状态下 EVA 会变得多么强大。她准备好享受这场屠杀。

Then the slaughter happened. Just the slaughtered wasn't the Angel.  
然后屠杀发生了。只是被屠杀的并非使徒。

Even with the newly acquired power, without a proper weapon Unit 01 couldn't make any progress. Asuka watched in dread as both sides expanded their AT-Fields, the ground shook as the phase space neutralized. And when it came to competing for physical strength, Unit 01, no matter how many physics laws it broke with its movements, was no match against Sandalphon's absolute defense.  
即便获得了新力量，没有合适的武器，初号机依然无法取得进展。明日香惊恐地看着双方扩展 AT 力场，地面在相位空间中和时震动。而在比拼物理力量时，初号机无论其动作打破了多少物理定律，都无法匹敌桑达菲翁的绝对防御。

_'Come on, Shinji!'_ Her initial jealousy had already vaporized under the pressure of the situation. She suddenly felt idiotic to envy other pilots getting more Angel kills than her - every time they sortie, it was a life-or-death situation for _humanity._ For every punch Unit 01 landed on the Angel she would silently cheer for it, and only had her heart sunk in disappointment as every time there was no damage done.  
'加油，真嗣！'她最初的嫉妒在局势压力下早已烟消云散。她突然觉得自己嫉妒其他飞行员比她击杀更多使徒是多么愚蠢——每次出击，都是人类生死攸关的时刻。每当初号机对使徒挥出一拳，她都会默默为之欢呼，但每次看到毫无损伤时，心中只有失望沉沦。

Asuka went mouth agape, and her mind went blank in fear as she saw Sandalphon cut off both of Unit 01's legs like a knife cutting through butter with another ferocious swing of its blade-shaped tail. The fortified armor stood no chance against something that had a stiffness index several levels above it, after all. The only saving grace for Shinji was his sync rate wasn't above one hundred.  
明日香目瞪口呆，恐惧让她的思绪一片空白，当她看到桑达菲翁再次猛烈挥动其刀刃状的尾巴，如同切黄油般切断了初号机的双腿。毕竟，强化装甲在硬度指数高出数级的东西面前毫无抵抗之力。真嗣唯一的幸运是他的同步率并未超过一百。

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

The redhead caught the one last glimpse of Unit 01's gaze before it fell down. From the deep sadness in it, she could swear it was conveying a message to her.  
红发少女在 01 号机坠落前捕捉到了它最后一瞥的目光。从那深邃的悲伤中，她发誓那目光在向她传递着某种信息。

_'I'm sorry, Asuka…' '对不起，明日香…'_

Sandalphon snorted at the wrecked immobile form of Unit 01 and Unit 00, then continued marching toward its long-anticipated reunion with its progenitor.  
桑达尔丰对 01 号机和 00 号机那破损不堪、无法动弹的身躯嗤之以鼻，随即继续迈步走向与它期盼已久的始祖重逢之路。

"Captain Katsuragi!" Gendo stood up from his chair and slammed his hands down onto his desk. "Send out Unit 02 now!"  
“葛城美里队长！”碇源堂从椅子上站起身，双手猛地拍在桌面上。“立即派出二号机！”

Misato went wide-eyed. If Shinji and Rei weren't able to defeat the Angel, then Asuka, even under her normal condition, wouldn't have a chance, not to mention she couldn't so much as activate her EVA right now. "But Unit 02 is…"  
美里瞪大了眼睛。如果真嗣和丽都无法击败使徒，那么明日香，即使在正常状态下，也毫无胜算，更不用说她现在连启动 EVA 都做不到。“但二号机它……”

"I said send it out now!" Gendo raised his volume, a stark contrast to his usual calm composure. He didn't know why or how Unit 01 could be defeated. Wasn't his son a looper? Or was the Angel just too powerful? Shinji did say about helping him with his scenario…so did this mean if he didn't have foreknowledge, everything would end even faster?  
“我说了，现在就派出它！”碇源堂提高了音量，与他平时的冷静沉着形成鲜明对比。他不知道为何或如何初号机会被击败。难道他的儿子是个失败者吗？还是使徒太过强大？真嗣确实提到过帮他处理他的剧本……这是否意味着，如果没有先知先觉，一切会结束得更快？

Misato gritted her teeth. Though she didn't want to do it, she really had no choice. If Unit 00 and 01 fell, then Unit 02 would be the only possible backup they had left. Even under its AT-Field-less state, their conventional weapons couldn't do anything more than simply annoy the Angel, let alone Sandalphon had already raised its AT-Field in defense against Unit 01 moments ago. "Asuka," Misato spoke into the microphone.  
美里咬紧牙关。虽然她不想这么做，但她真的别无选择。如果零号机和初号机倒下，那么二号机将是他们仅剩的可能支援。即便在无 AT 力场状态下，他们的常规武器也只能稍微惹恼使徒，更不用说桑达尔丰刚刚已经升起了 AT 力场防御初号机。“明日香，”美里对着麦克风说道。

"I'm already on it," The redheaded girl cut her off, driving her wheelchair at its top speed, heading to the EVA cages.  
“我已经行动了，”红发女孩打断她，以轮椅的最快速度驶向 EVA 机库。

"We're doomed," Ritsuko murmured in desperation, internally cursing at herself for why she didn't find the Fourth Child fast enough. "Asuka couldn't even activate her EVA, much less defeat this Angel."  
“我们完蛋了，”律子绝望地喃喃自语，内心咒骂自己为何没能尽快找到第四适格者。“明日香连启动 EVA 都做不到，更别提打败这个使徒了。”

"Still," The lavender-haired woman took in a deep breath and exhaled before turning to face the screen. "We have to hope."  
“尽管如此，”紫发女子深吸一口气，缓缓吐出，随后转向屏幕，“我们只能寄希望于此。”

Asuka parked the wheelchair on the maintenance bridge beside the entry plug of her EVA, which had been in a shallow frozen state for two weeks. She didn't even bother to change into a plug suit since it would take a painfully long time under her current crippled state with or without help. The female technician saw her here and immediately connected the dots before picking her up and helped her get inside the entry plug.  
明日香将轮椅停在维护桥上，旁边是她 EVA 的插入栓，已经浅冻了两周。她连换上插入服都懒得，因为以她目前瘫痪的状态，无论是否有人帮忙，这都将是一个漫长而痛苦的过程。一位女技师看到她在这里，立刻明白了情况，上前将她抱起，协助她进入插入栓。

Asuka closed her eyes as she stroked the controls of her EVA and the pilot seat, relishing in the familiar sensation of the touch. The feeling of synthetic plastic and rubber rubbing against her hand soothed her anxiousness with every passing moment, but it didn't wipe out her growing nervousness about what was to come.  
明日香闭上眼睛，轻抚着 EVA 的控制台和驾驶座椅，享受着熟悉的触感。合成塑料和橡胶摩擦手掌的感觉，每分每秒都在安抚她的焦虑，但并未消除她对即将到来之事日益增长的紧张感。

"Begin Activation!" Maya shouted over the comms. "Entry Plug inserted…Commence Entry Plug LCL injection. LCL filled. Establishing A10 connections. A-10 connections established and stable. All circuits are operational…"  
"开始激活！" 玛雅通过通讯器喊道。"插入栓已插入…开始注入插入栓 LCL。LCL 已充满。建立 A10 连接。A10 连接已建立并稳定。所有电路均正常运行…"

Asuka could feel it again, the invisible door blocking her from connecting with her EVA. She closed her eyes and concentrated on her thoughts, using her usual way of forcing her will onto the EVA. But it wouldn't work. The harder she pushed against the obstacle, the firmer it stood its ground.  
明日香再次感受到了那道无形的门，阻挡她与 EVA 建立连接。她闭上眼睛，集中精神，用她惯常的方式将意志强加于 EVA。但这次行不通。她越是用力推那障碍，它越是坚定地坚守原地。

"She's still not passing the absolute borderline!" Maya reported as she saw the disappointing readings on her terminal. "Her sync rate is too low to activate the EVA!"  
"她仍未突破绝对界限！" 玛雅报告道，看着终端上令人失望的读数。"她的同步率太低，无法启动 EVA！"

Everyone on the command deck fell silent. "Figures…" Ritsuko sighed dejectedly. "The world, it ends today…"  
指挥舱内的每个人都陷入了沉默。“果然……”律子沮丧地叹息道，“世界，今天就要终结了……”

A deep scowl crossed Misato's face. The world…would end? She knew NERV was established to fight the Angels, but that was it. She didn't even know why the Angels attacked them, nor she knew where did they come from. The fact that every Angel except Gaghiel had attacked Tokyo-3 was uncanny. Why here? Did NERV know where they were going to attack and built a fortress here? She found it impossible to answer these questions, but she needed to know what she was fighting for.  
美里眉头紧锁。世界……会终结吗？她知道 NERV 是为了对抗使徒而成立的，但也就仅此而已。她甚至不知道使徒为何攻击他们，也不知道它们从何而来。除了加吉尔之外，每个使徒都攻击了东京-3，这实在令人费解。为什么是这里？难道 NERV 知道它们会攻击这里，所以在这里建了一座堡垒？她觉得这些问题无法回答，但她需要知道自己在为什么而战。

Not that she could anymore if they didn't stop the incoming Angel…  
如果他们不阻止即将到来的使徒，她也无法再继续战斗了……

"What's MAGI's suggestion?" Asked Captain Katsuragi.  
"MAGI 的建议是什么？" 葛城美里队长问道。

"The three parts of MAGI has reached a unanimous conclusion of self-destructing NERV HQ," came the reply from Dr. Akagi, which fueled Misato's suspicion even more.  
"MAGI 的三个部分一致得出了自毁 NERV 总部的结论，" 赤木律子博士回答道，这让美里的疑虑更深了。

"The Angel has arrived at Gora Absolute Defense Line!" Hyuga shouted. "We have about eight minutes until it reaches Tokyo-3!"  
"使徒已经抵达 Gora 绝对防御线！" 青叶喊道，"我们大约还有八分钟它就会到达第三新东京市！"

"Shit," Misato opened a comm channel to Unit 02. "Asuka, focus! Try harder! You're our last hope!"  
"该死，" 美里打开与二号机的通讯频道，"明日香，集中精神！再努力一点！你是我们最后的希望！"

Asuka bit down on her lips as another attempt to connect with her EVA failed. No matter how hard she tried, the invisible door would push back even harder. _'Why wouldn't you listen to me?!'_ Asuka raged. _'Move, you damned machine!'_  
明日香咬紧嘴唇，又一次尝试与她的 EVA 建立连接失败了。无论她多么努力，那无形的门都会以更强的力量推回。'为什么你不听我的？！' 明日香愤怒地喊道，'动起来，你这该死的机器！'

_"EVA is more than just a machine, Asuka."  
"EVA 不仅仅是机器，明日香。"_

_"EVA is a mirror that reflects your heart. You need to open up yourself to it."  
“EVA 是你心灵的镜子。你需要向它敞开心扉。”_

As if aroused by her last thought, Rei's words rang in her ears. Opening up? Asuka had no idea of how to do that; it didn't exactly come with a manual, did it?  
仿佛被她最后的念头所触动，丽的话语在她耳边回响。敞开心扉？明日香不知道该怎么做；这可没有附带说明书，对吧？

Still, she had to try. This wasn't just merely her chance to shine by killing this Angel and reasserting her position as an EVA pilot, this was a vendetta, a vendetta against all of the Angels for what that monster had done to her, and to Shinji.  
尽管如此，她必须尝试。这不仅仅是通过消灭这个使徒并重新确立自己作为 EVA 驾驶员地位的机会，这是一场复仇，一场对所有使徒的复仇，因为那个怪物对她和真嗣所做的一切。

Asuka tried to relax in the warmth of LCL, clearing her turmoil of thoughts. Closing her eyes, slowly she reached out to the 'door' blocking her before; the smooth door of presence in her mind she had been visualizing as, was still there, standing in the way between her and the EVA. But this time, she didn't try to push it open. Instead, she thought of a handle on it, then pulled.  
明日香试图在 LCL 的温暖中放松，平息内心的纷乱思绪。她闭上双眼，缓缓地伸向那道曾阻隔她的“门”；那扇在她脑海中被想象为平滑存在的门，依旧矗立在她与 EVA 之间。但这一次，她没有尝试推开它。相反，她想象着门上有一个把手，然后拉开了它。

Then the EVA _responded._ 随后，EVA 做出了反应。

_'So I've been opening it in the wrong way…'_ was the last conscious thought she had before her vision turned white.  
‘原来我一直都是用错方法打开的……’这是她视线变白前的最后一个清醒念头。

"Akagi-Senpai! Something's happening!" Maya's worried voice captured the already-gave-up blonde doctor. "Pilot Soryu's sync rate…I don't understand!"  
“赤木前辈！出事了！”真嗣担忧的声音引起了本已放弃的黄发医生的注意。“明日香驾驶员的同步率……我搞不懂！”

"What's going on?" Ritsuko rushed to her terminal and looked at the readings. For one moment, she thought the equipment was glitching since her brain failed to process what the screen was displaying. "What the…" On the monitor, no matter how hard it was for her to believe, Asuka's sync rate was rapidly fluctuating between negative and positive fifty percent. She knew that people might be able to reach a sync rate of over one hundred percent with the EVA, and she had a good guess of what would happen next. But negative sync rates? She didn't think that was even possible. What's next? Imaginary number sync rate? "Asuka! What's happening in there?!" She shouted into the microphone but received no replies whatsoever.  
"发生什么事了？" 律子急忙冲到她的终端前查看读数。有那么一刻，她以为设备出现了故障，因为她的脑子无法处理屏幕上显示的内容。"搞什么鬼……" 在监视器上，尽管她难以置信，但明日香的同步率正在负五十和正五十之间急剧波动。她知道有些人或许能与 EVA 达到超过百分之一百的同步率，她对接下来会发生什么也有个大致的猜测。但负同步率？她从未认为这可能发生。接下来会是什么？虚数同步率吗？"明日香！里面发生了什么？!" 她对着麦克风大喊，却未得到任何回应。

Opening the video feed, she saw Asuka sitting on the pilot seat, her eyes closed, not responding to any outside stimulations. "That's it. This is too dangerous! Cut the connection!"  
打开视频 feed，她看到明日香坐在驾驶座上，双眼紧闭，对外界刺激毫无反应。"就这样。这太危险了！切断连接！"

"Belay that," came Captain Katsuragi's calm voice. "Give her some time. I believe she can do it."  
"取消那个命令，" 传来葛城上尉平静的声音。"给她一些时间。我相信她能做到。"

_Why are you here? 你为什么在这里？_

Asuka's eyes snapped open as a strangely familiar voice sounded in her head. Looking around her, she could see nothing but an endless white void. What was this place? How did she end up here? The last thing she could remember was reaching out to the EVA…using her brilliant brain to put two and two together, she was pretty sure that she was somehow communicating with the 'machine'. "Who are you? Show yourself!" She shouted into the void.  
明日香的双眼猛地睁开，一个异常熟悉的声音在她脑海中响起。环顾四周，她只能看到一片无尽的白色虚空。这是哪里？她怎么会来到这里？她最后记得的是伸手去触碰 EVA……凭借她聪慧的头脑，她相当确定自己正在以某种方式与“机器”沟通。“你是谁？现身吧！”她对着虚空喊道。

As if aroused by her words, another redhead emerged from the void, floating far away from her; what terrified the original Asuka was she held a doll in her hand. "Wh-what are you?"  
仿佛被她的话语唤醒，另一个红发女孩从虚空中浮现，远远地飘离她；让原本的明日香感到恐惧的是，她手中抱着一个玩偶。“你……你是什么？”

_I am the EVA. 我是 EVA。_

"Fuck, wondergirl is actually right…" Asuka murmured to herself before raising her volume, "well, let me pilot, then!"  
"该死，明日香居然真的说对了……" 绫波自言自语道，随即提高了音量，"好吧，那就让我来驾驶吧！"

_I cannot. I need to protect you.  
我不能。我需要保护你。_

"What a load of bullshit," Asuka cursed. "I don't need your protection! I need you to listen to my commands!"  
"真是满口胡言，" 明日香咒骂道。"我不需要你的保护！我需要你听从我的命令！"

_Last time I let you pilot you got hurt. I cannot let that happen again.  
上次让你驾驶，你受伤了。我不能再让这种事发生。_

Asuka found herself at a loss for words. Even though she wanted to retort, she couldn't deny the fact. But why would the EVA be willing to protect her? She's not its…daughter or something.  
明日香一时语塞。尽管她想反驳，却无法否认这个事实。但为什么 EVA 愿意保护她呢？它又不是她的……女儿之类的。

_Why do you want to pilot?  
你为什么要驾驶？_

"Because everyone will die if I don't!" Asuka cried desperately. "Kaji, Misato, people in Tokyo-3…" She paused for a moment. "And Shinji…"  
“因为如果我不驾驶，大家都会死！”明日香绝望地哭喊着，“加持、美里、第三新东京市的人们……”她顿了一下，“还有真嗣……”

…_? Who is it?_ ……？是谁？

Asuka could swear the voice carried a note of curiosity in it this time. "He… he's a fellow pilot! My…my friend!" Her tone saddened as she spoke about what came next. "And the Angel defeated him…if I don't pilot, they will all die!"  
明日香可以发誓，这次的声音中带着一丝好奇。“他……他也是一名驾驶员！我的……我的朋友！”她谈到接下来发生的事情时，语气变得悲伤。“而使徒击败了他……如果我不驾驶，他们都会死！”

…_Does he make you happy?_  
……他让你感到快乐吗？

"I'm not sure…" Asuka still had a hard time understanding his behaviors. She _needed_ him taking care of her, she _enjoyed_ being close to him, but did she really _want_ it? But one thing she was sure of. "But I don't want to lose him."  
“我不确定……”明日香仍然难以理解他的行为。她需要他照顾她，她喜欢靠近他，但她真的想要这样吗？但有一件事她很确定。“但我不希望失去他。”

…_So now you pilot for the others, but not for yourself?_  
……所以现在你为别人驾驶，却不为自己？

Asuka pondered for a moment. She couldn't deny the fact that there was still a small part of her, wishing to reclaim her pilot status through this sortie. But now, the majority of her determination came from her fear of losing someone she cared about. What good was she if she had no one care about her? "No… I'm not piloting for myself anymore…I don't want the world to end!" She screamed, her voice breaking just the slightest. "I don't want to let everyone I care about die!" Asuka felt a sudden heaviness in her chest and a lump form in her throat. "So let me pilot! _Please!_"  
明日香沉思片刻。她无法否认内心仍有一小部分渴望通过这次出击重拾驾驶员身份。但如今，她大部分的决心源自于对失去所爱之人的恐惧。如果没有人关心她，她还有什么价值？“不……我不再为自己驾驶了……我不想世界终结！”她尖叫着，声音略微哽咽。“我不想让我在乎的每个人都死去！”明日香感到胸口一阵沉重，喉咙里也堵了一团东西。“所以让我驾驶吧！求你了！”

_You're not afraid of losing something else, of getting hurt again? You could die in battle.  
你不怕失去其他东西，再次受伤吗？你可能会在战斗中丧命。_

Asuka went silent for a moment. Was she scared? A little bit, perhaps. The loss of her legs was really an earth shatter on her self-confidence. What if the next time the Angel went for her head? What if-  
明日香沉默了一会儿。她害怕吗？或许有一点。失去双腿对她自信心的打击无疑是巨大的。如果下一次使徒瞄准她的头部怎么办？如果——

_'But I'm a warrior, the world's most elite, even,'_ Asuka fought back. _'I must be pathetic to be afraid of injuries. Besides, people need me right now. I can't let them down, especially Shinji, because of my own insecurities.'_  
'但我是一名战士，世界上最精英的战士，'明日香反击道。'因为害怕受伤而显得可怜。而且，现在人们需要我。我不能因为自己的不安而让他们失望，尤其是真嗣。'

…_I see. Are you ready, then?_  
…我明白了。那么，你准备好了吗？

Asuka blinked in surprise as she found out the EVA could read her thoughts, but quickly recomposed herself, knowing there wasn't too much time left for her to moping around. "I'm ready." A confident smirk crept up her face.  
当明日香惊讶地发现 EVA 能读懂她的心思时，她迅速调整了情绪，知道没有太多时间让她继续消沉。“我准备好了。”她脸上浮现出自信的微笑。

_Yui's son…huh? I hope you can take care of my daughter…_ Kyoko thought after Asuka's consciousness returned to her body. _Now… let's see what you can do, my sweetheart…_  
Yui 的儿子……嗯？希望你能照顾好我的女儿……明日香的意识回到身体后，Kyoko 心想。现在……让我看看你能做些什么，我的宝贝……

Inside the EVA cages, Unit 02's eyes glowed.  
在 EVA 的牢笼内，二号机的眼睛闪烁着光芒。

"Asuka's sync rate is spiking! Absolute borderline passed!" Maya reported in surprise, "Unit 02 has activated! Her sync rate stabilized at eighty-five percent!"  
"明日香的同步率在飙升！绝对界限已突破！" 真希报告道，语气中带着惊讶，"02 号机启动了！她的同步率稳定在 85%！"

"Wow," Ritsuko raised an eyebrow.  
"哇哦，" 律子挑了挑眉。

"Asuka, can you hear me Asuka?" Misato shouted excitedly into the comms. She knew she could do it, knowing how brilliant she was. Now the only issue was how to defeat the Angel that had an absolute physical defense.  
"明日香，你能听到我吗，明日香？" 美里兴奋地对着通讯器喊道。她知道明日香能做到，知道她是多么出色。现在唯一的问题是如何击败那个拥有绝对物理防御的使徒。

"Armed and ready, Misato!" Asuka's cheerful and confident voice echoed through the command center, bringing the long-gone hope back to people, eliciting small smiles from their faces.  
"武装完毕，准备就绪，美里！" 明日香那欢快而自信的声音在指挥中心回荡，为人们带来了久违的希望，让他们脸上露出了淡淡的微笑。

"Alright. Listen carefully, Asuka," Misato took a deep breath. "This Angel is really powerful, you saw it by yourself. We may not survive today, but," she paused for a moment, "I believe in you, Asuka. So do your best, and kick that Angel's ass!"  
"好的，仔细听着，明日香，" 美里深吸了一口气。"这个使徒非常强大，你自己也看到了。我们今天可能无法幸存，但是，" 她顿了顿，"我相信你，明日香。所以尽你最大的努力，踢飞那个使徒的屁股！"

"You got it!" "明白！"

Misato nodded. "EVA LAUNCH!"  
美里点头。"EVA 发射！"

While Unit 02 went on its way up the chute, Asuka closed her eyes and concentrated. She could feel it again. She could feel the cold metal of the lift on her feet, a sensation she missed recently due to her disabled state. She could feel the wind grazing against her skin as the elevator shot upwards. She clenched her hands into a fist and could feel Unit 02 do the same. Most notably of all though, she could feel the warmth and comfort that she used to find in her entry plug.  
当 02 号机沿着通道上升时，明日香闭上眼睛，集中精神。她再次感受到了那种感觉。她能感受到脚下的电梯冷冰冰的金属，这种感觉最近因为她的状态不佳而错过了。随着电梯飞速上升，她能感受到风拂过皮肤。她紧握双拳，也能感受到 02 号机做出同样的动作。但最明显的是，她能感受到曾经在插入栓中找到的温暖和安慰。

Opening her eyes, she narrowed them as she thought about what the Angel did to her fellow pilots on the surface. Cracking an evil grin, Asuka could feel more than just the thrill of going into combat flowing through her, but a driving hatred for the Angels that only further motivated her.  
睁开眼睛，她眯起双眼，思考着使徒对地面上她的同伴们所做的一切。明日香露出了邪恶的笑容，她感受到的不仅仅是投入战斗的兴奋，还有一种对使徒的深切仇恨，这进一步激励了她。

Once her Unit 02 reached the surface, Misato's voice came to her through the comm channel. "Asuka, there is a downscaled positron rifle inside the armament building on your right. The anti-matter weapon might be our only chance to pierce the Angel's skin!"  
当二号机抵达地面时，美里通过通讯频道向她传来指令：“明日香，你右侧的军械库内有一把缩小版的阳电子步枪。这反物质武器可能是我们穿透使徒皮肤的唯一机会！”

"Right," Asuka took out the improved positron rifle from the weaponry building and entered sniping position. From her EVA's monitor, she could see the Angel slowly creeping toward Tokyo-3, destroying and crushing every structure and armored battalion that dared to stand in its way. Using the help from Augmented Reality to aim, Asuka took a deep breath and fired.  
“明白，”明日香从武器库中取出改良的阳电子步枪，进入狙击状态。透过 EVA 的监视器，她看到使徒正缓慢逼近第三新东京市，摧毁并碾压着敢于阻挡在其道路上的每一座建筑和装甲部队。借助增强现实技术的辅助瞄准，明日香深吸一口气，扣动了扳机。

A round of bright positrons flew toward the Angel at lightning speed, the shockwave formed by the heated expansion of air swept across the area following its trajectory. However, upon hitting the target, an orange octangular barrier appeared in front of the Angel, easily blocking the beam of high-energy charged particles, shattering it into several separate chunks.  
一束耀眼的阳电子以闪电般的速度射向使徒，由高温膨胀空气形成的冲击波沿着其轨迹横扫整个区域。然而，当击中目标时，使徒面前出现了一道橙色的八角形屏障，轻而易举地挡住了这束高能带电粒子束，将其击碎成数块。

"We don't have enough power to penetrate its AT-Field!" Aoba exclaimed.  
"我们的能量不足以穿透它的 AT 力场！" 青叶惊呼道。

"Unfortunately, we don't have time to redirect power from entire Japan this time…" Ritsuko sighed in defeat. Impressed by the superior performance of the positron rifle in the sortie against Ramiel, the weaponry department designed a new type of it that had a faster reload time and a more portable power source. However, the trade-off was its power, which now became a deadly disadvantage.  
“不幸的是，这次我们没有时间从整个日本重新分配电力……”律子叹息着认输。对战拉米尔时阳电子炮的出色表现印象深刻，武器部门设计了一种新型号，具有更快的装填时间和更便携的电源。然而，代价是其威力，现在成了致命的劣势。

"Useless trash," Asuka huffed and threw the rifle away. If there was another EVA, they could work together with one of them neutralizing the Angel's AT-Field, while the other one would take the shot. Now though, her EVA was the only operational Unit, and she was probably also the sole conscious pilot.  
"没用的废物，" 明日香哼了一声，把步枪扔掉。如果有另一台 EVA，他们可以合作，一个中和使徒的 AT 力场，另一个负责射击。但现在，她的 EVA 是唯一能运作的单位，而她可能也是唯一清醒的驾驶员。

Asuka's brain went on overdrive as the Angel continued creeping toward the Geofront. This monster had an absolute physical defense; fighting it in close quarters would be asking for trouble, and the misfortune of Unit 00 and Unit 01 had already proven it. But in the long-range, she had no idea of how to deal with its AT-Field.  
随着使徒继续向 Geofront 逼近，明日香的大脑飞速运转。这个怪物拥有绝对的物理防御；近距离战斗无疑是自找麻烦，而零号机和初号机的遭遇已经证明了这一点。但在远距离上，她对如何对付它的 AT 力场毫无头绪。

It was an unsolvable dilemma.  
这是一个无解的困境。

"The Angel has entered the city's outer perimeter!" Hyuga's urgent voice came through the comm channel.  
“天使已进入城市外围！”日向急促的声音通过通讯频道传来。

_'No time to waste…'_ Asuka gritted her teeth and pushed the controls forward. If she had to choose between an AT-Field and heavy armor, the latter would look like a better choice. Upon entering a distance close enough to neutralize the phase space, Asuka expanded her AT-Field, clashing against the Angel's.  
“没时间浪费了……”明日香咬紧牙关，向前推动操纵杆。如果必须在 AT 力场和重装甲之间选择，后者看起来更胜一筹。进入足以中和相位空间的距离后，明日香展开了她的 AT 力场，与天使的力场激烈碰撞。

Shrieking, Sandalphon swung its tail viciously at the crimson EVA Unit, cutting several heavily armored buildings into halves along the way. Working on reflex, Asuka jumped into the air, barely missing the deadly strike. However, her umbilical cord wasn't so lucky as it was severed by the attack, and the timer started flashing, counting down from 5 minutes.  
尖叫声中，桑达风猛烈地挥动尾巴，向红色 EVA 单位袭来，沿途将几座重装甲建筑劈成两半。明日香凭借本能跃入空中，险险躲过致命一击。然而，她的脐带电缆就没那么幸运了，被攻击切断，计时器开始闪烁，从 5 分钟倒计时。

"Scheisse!" Asuka cursed, jumping from place to place to avoid the lethal strikes. She needed a plan, fast.  
"该死！" 明日香咒骂着，从一个地方跳到另一个地方以躲避致命的攻击。她需要一个计划，快。

Suddenly Asuka noticed a subtle change in the Angel's skin. It seemed…lighter in color.  
突然，明日香注意到使徒皮肤上的细微变化。它似乎……颜色变浅了。

_"The intense heat in the volcano must've adjusted its molecular structure!"  
火山中的高温一定调整了它的分子结构！_

"I get it now!" Asuka exclaimed as the realization dawned on her. "It's physics! The Angel's constant exposure to air is weakening its skin!"  
"我现在明白了！" 明日香恍然大悟地喊道，"这是物理现象！天使长时间暴露在空气中，皮肤正在被削弱！"

Ritsuko patted her thigh, "right! Brilliant observation!" She typed furiously on her terminal. "The MAGI's calculation suggests that its physical strength has decreased by 15 percent since it came out of the volcano!"  
律子拍了拍大腿，"没错！观察得真敏锐！" 她在终端上飞速输入，"MAGI 的计算显示，自从它从火山中出来后，物理强度已经下降了 15%！"

"Only 15 percent?! In two hours?!" Asuka cried. "How long until the prog knife can cut through it?"  
"只有 15%？！两个小时内？！" 明日香惊呼，"还要多久才能用程序刀切开它？"

"5 hours at least," the joy in Ritsuko's voice was replaced by disappointment. "The density of air molecules is too low to have a significant influence on the Angel."  
"至少需要 5 小时，" 律子声音中的喜悦被失望所取代。"空气分子的密度太低，对使徒的影响微乎其微。"

"But I only have 5 minutes!" Cried Asuka as she narrowly avoided another tail strike.  
"但我只有 5 分钟！" 明日香一边喊着，一边险险躲过又一次尾击。"

"Go to building E-15. There's another power station there!"  
"去 E-15 号建筑，那里还有另一个发电站！"

"Roger!" Asuka willed her EVA sprint toward building E-15, a power supply building in the outer part of the city. Sandalphon wasn't going to let its enemy escape so easily, though.  
“罗杰！”明日香操控她的 EVA 向城市外围的 E-15 号供电大楼疾驰而去。然而，桑达尔丰并不打算轻易放过它的敌人。

Just as Asuka reached the power station, the Angel leaped into the air, coming down onto its opponent with its mouth wide open. "What the hell?" Asuka hastily rolled aside; the Angel came crashing down onto the building, turning the fortified skyscraper into a pile of rubble of steel and concrete.  
就在明日香抵达电站之际，天使一跃而起，张开大口向对手扑来。“搞什么鬼？”明日香急忙侧滚躲避；天使轰然坠落于大楼之上，将这座加固的摩天大楼瞬间化为钢筋混凝土的废墟。

"Verdammt!" Asuka looked at the screen that was showing a time remaining of 4 minutes. She scanned around the area, "where's the next power-" Asuka trailed off as she saw the place hundreds of meters in front of her, a smirk crept up her face.  
“该死！”明日香盯着屏幕上显示的剩余 4 分钟时间，环顾四周，“下一个电源在哪儿——”她话音未落，目光落在了前方数百米处，嘴角不禁勾起一抹笑意。

Lake Ashi. 芦之湖。

"Chase me, you ugly monster!" Asuka sprinted toward the vast water body, the single-minded Angel chasing after her. "Giant Stride entry!" Said Asuka before her EVA Unit spread its right leg forward and its left leg backward as she jumped into the lake gracefully.  
"追我啊，你这丑陋的怪物！" 明日香朝着广阔的水域疾奔，一心一意的使徒紧随其后。"大步跳入！" 明日香说完，她的 EVA 二号机右腿前伸，左腿后摆，优雅地跃入湖中。

Following its enemy, Sandalphon crept into the lake as well, raising a cloud of water vapor as its heated body made contact with the cold liquid. The Angel shrieked in agony and tried to get out, but Unit 02 had a firm grasp on its mushroom-like horns. "You're not going anywhere!" Asuka mustered all of her strength to pull the Angel into the deep-water zone.  
紧随其后的桑达丰也潜入湖中，其炽热的身体与冰冷的湖水接触，激起一片水汽。使徒痛苦地尖叫，试图逃脱，但二号机紧紧抓住了它蘑菇状的犄角。"你哪儿也别想去！" 明日香使出全身力气，将使徒拖入深水区。

Even though Lake Ashi had a maximum depth of merely 50 meters, it's deep enough to submerge the entire Angel at its creeping state. EVA Unit 02 stood at the bottom of the lake, its upper torso above the waterline. Sandalphon swung its blade-like tale at the crimson behemoth once again in a vain attempt of escape.  
尽管芦之湖的最大深度仅为 50 米，但它足以淹没处于缓慢状态的使徒。EVA 二号机站在湖底，其上半身露出水面。桑达尔丰再次挥动其刀刃般的尾巴，试图逃离这红色巨兽，但此举徒劳无功。

_CLANK_

"Ouch that hurts," Asuka looked down at the point of contact and surprisingly found out no real damage was inflicted onto her EVA. "Not so strong now, huh?" With an evil grin, Asuka pulled out her prog knife from her left shoulder pylon and aimed at what looked like the eye of the Angel.  
“哎哟，真疼，”明日香低头看着接触点，惊讶地发现她的 EVA 并未受到实际伤害。“现在不怎么强了吧？”带着邪恶的笑容，明日香从左肩支柱上拔出她的程序刀，瞄准了那看似使徒眼睛的部位。

Utilizing the fact that at the moment Unit 02 only had one of its arms suppressing it, Sandalphon twisted its body violently and got rid of Unit 02's grasp, opening its mouth wide and bit down onto the right leg of the crimson EVA Unit. "Ahhh!" Asuka yelped in pain, the sensation of her legs hurting was something she missed recently. "You're soooo gonna pay for it!"  
利用二号机此刻仅有一只手臂压制它的机会，桑达尔丰猛烈扭动身体，摆脱了二号机的抓握，张开大口咬住了红色 EVA 的右腿。“啊！”明日香痛呼出声，腿部受伤的感觉是她最近所怀念的。“你绝对会为此付出代价的！”

Sandalphon started swimming around in the lake, twisting and turning savagely along the way, trying to pull the leg off the EVA Unit. Asuka gritted her teeth, enduring the pain, and took a glance at the timer. Only one minute was left. "No time to waste…eat this, bastard!" Screaming, Asuka made Unit 02 open the top of both its right shoulder pylon. Followed by this was a loud bang as dozens of razor-sharp titanium spikes shot out of the pylon, piercing the Angel's armor, making it bellow in pain as the spikes made contact.  
桑达风开始在湖中游动，沿途扭曲翻滚，试图扯下 EVA 单位的腿。明日香咬紧牙关，忍着疼痛，瞥了一眼计时器。只剩下一分钟了。“没时间浪费了……吃我这一招，混蛋！”明日香尖叫着，让 02 号机打开了右肩塔架的顶部。紧接着是一声巨响，数十根锋利的钛合金尖刺从塔架中射出，刺穿了使徒的装甲，使其因接触到尖刺而痛苦地咆哮。

The Angel let go of Unit 02's leg under the intolerable agony. Asuka took a firmer hold on Angel this time; with a vicious swing, Unit 02 brought down the knife onto the Angel's core, causing for sparks to fly as it ripped right through it with little issue. The Angel made a deep groan of pain that echoed through her cockpit before the core gave in, exploding into a giant ball of fire, vaporizing the remaining water of Lake Ashi.  
在难以忍受的痛苦下，使徒放开了 02 号机的腿。明日香这次更紧地抓住了使徒；02 号机猛地一挥，将刀劈向使徒的核心，随着火花四溅，轻松地将其劈开。使徒发出了一声深沉的痛苦呻吟，声音在她的驾驶舱中回荡，随后核心崩溃，爆炸成一个巨大的火球，蒸发了芦之湖剩余的水。

"Asuka, y..y..you did it!" Misato's voice came through the comm channel, mixed with people's cheers in the background. She could practically hear the tears pouring out of her eyes. "But h..h..how did you…"  
“明日香，你……你做到了！”美里通过通讯频道传来声音，背景中夹杂着人们的欢呼声。她几乎能听到自己泪流满面的声音。“但是……你是怎么……”

"What do you expect," Asuka smirked confidently, "from the _great_ Asuka Langley Soryu?" She boasted, feeling proud of herself. "What about Shinji and wondergirl?" She inquired as she willed her EVA toward the retrieval elevator.  
"你还能指望什么，" 明日香自信地扬起嘴角，"来自伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷？" 她自夸道，对自己感到自豪。"那真嗣和那个笨蛋呢？" 她问道，同时操控着 EVA 向回收电梯移动。

"They're fine. No physical damage was done," Misato sighed. "You can go see them in the hospital when our medical team brings them back."  
"他们没事。没有受到身体上的伤害，" 美里叹了口气。"等我们的医疗团队把他们带回来后，你可以去医院看望他们。"

"Alright." She nodded, shutting off the comm channel with a punch on the buttons. She brought up a smile to her face as the realization of what she had just done kicked in. Not long ago she was sitting in her wheelchair brooding on how meaningless her life had become, and now she's here claiming the grandest victory against the most lethal Angel they had faced yet.  
"好吧。" 她点头，一拳敲下按钮关闭通讯频道。当意识到自己刚刚所做的事情时，她脸上露出了笑容。不久前她还坐在轮椅上，沉溺于生活变得多么无意义的忧郁中，而现在她却在这里，取得了对抗迄今为止最致命使徒的伟大胜利。

"Thank you, Shinji," She smiled. Even though she still hated the idea of relying on someone else, she felt she should make this one exception. After all, he had saved her life.  
“谢谢你，真嗣，”她微笑着。尽管她仍然讨厌依赖他人的想法，但她觉得应该破例这一次。毕竟，是他救了她的命。

With a hiss the hatch of her entry plug opened. At the moment, Asuka's mind was filled with joy and excitement, not paying much attention to other trivial stuff other than her grand comeback. She climbed out of her entry plug in a swift movement; she could see Misato running toward her with an expression mixed with relief, pride, and joy.  
随着一声嘶响，她的插入栓舱门打开了。此刻，明日香心中充满了喜悦和兴奋，除了她即将到来的华丽回归，其他琐事都无暇顾及。她迅速从插入栓中爬出；可以看到美里正向她跑来，脸上混合着释然、自豪和喜悦的表情。

Suddenly all of her expressions collapsed as the woman set her eyes on the girl. "What's wrong, Misato?" Asuka probed as she noticed the inscrutable expression on her face.  
突然，当女人注视着女孩时，所有的表情都消失了。“怎么了，美里？”明日香察觉到她脸上难以捉摸的表情，问道。

What came next, though, sent Asuka herself into a state of shock as well.  
然而，接下来发生的事情也让明日香自己陷入了震惊之中。

"…Did you just walk out of the entry plug by yourself?"  
“……你刚才是自己走出驾驶舱的吗？”

## *Chapter 16*: Chapter 16: Compromises  
*第十六章*: 第十六章：妥协

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》

**Chapter 16: Compromises 第十六章：妥协**

Shinji's eyes slowly cracked open, surprised to find himself staring at the familiar ceiling of NERV hospital instead of the telephone booth he expected. As the haziness in his mind gradually subsided, he gasped as the recollection of the disastrous last battle against Sandalphon reemerged. The last thing he remembered was defeated by the Angel – but from the fact that, apparently, the cycle didn't restart, the Angel must've been defeated. Did EVA Unit 01 go berserk by itself? No, it couldn't be it. He lost both of the legs, there wouldn't be much the EVA could do under that kind of injury. Or did Rei do it? But he had never seen Unit 00 go berserk in battle ever before.  
真嗣的眼睛缓缓睁开，惊讶地发现自己正盯着 NERV 医院的熟悉天花板，而不是他预想中的电话亭。随着脑海中的朦胧逐渐消散，他倒吸一口凉气，因为与萨达拉冯那场灾难性的最后一战的记忆重新浮现。他最后记得的是被天使击败——但从显然循环没有重启的事实来看，天使一定已经被击败了。是 EVA 初号机自己暴走了吗？不，不可能。他失去了双腿，EVA 在那种伤势下也做不了什么。还是说绫波零做到了？但他从未见过零号机在战斗中暴走。

That only left one feasible conclusion.  
这只能得出一个可行的结论。

Asuka. 明日香。

If it really was her…then it could only insinuate one thing. She could pilot her EVA again.  
如果真的是她……那么只能暗示一件事。她可以再次驾驶她的 EVA 了。

For a short period of time, Shinji didn't know whether or not he should be happy about it. On one hand, this way Asuka could be self-confident and prideful again, and she wouldn't think of herself as useless anymore. These would all contribute to improving her mentality. On the other hand, this would also likely mean her unhealthy bond with the EVA would strengthen once more, something he prioritized to help her get rid of.  
有一段时间，真嗣不知道自己是否应该为此感到高兴。一方面，这样一来，明日香可以重新变得自信和骄傲，不再认为自己一无是处。这些都有助于改善她的心态。另一方面，这也可能意味着她与 EVA 之间不健康的联系会再次加强，这是他优先考虑帮助她摆脱的。

How could he convince her that she can be happy even without the EVA? How could he make her believe the life outside of piloting was much more colorful and brighter?  
他该如何说服她，即使没有 EVA，她也能快乐？他该如何让她相信，驾驶之外的生活更加丰富多彩、更加光明？

His musings were interrupted by a familiar voice. "Shinji! You're awake!"  
他的沉思被一个熟悉的声音打断。"真嗣！你醒了！"

He turned his head in the direction of the voice and saw a girl sitting on a chair at his bedside with gorgeous red hair and brilliant blue eyes, wearing the school uniform. "Asuka?" He said weakly, confused by the sight. "What are you doing here?"  
他顺着声音的方向转过头，看到一个女孩坐在他床边的椅子上，拥有一头艳丽的红发和明亮的蓝眼睛，身着校服。“明日香？”他虚弱地说道，对眼前的景象感到困惑。“你在这里做什么？”

"Anta Baka? I'm here to make sure you're okay," to Shinji's surprise Asuka admitted freely. He was totally expecting her to say things like 'I'm here to remind you how great I am that I defeated the Angel which defeated you' or something like that. "I mean, you were there for me, so consider this as a payback."  
“你这个笨蛋？我来确保你没事，”让真嗣惊讶的是，明日香坦率地承认了。他原本以为她会说些类似“我来提醒你我有多厉害，我打败了那个打败了你的使徒”之类的话。“我是说，你之前帮过我，所以就当这是回报吧。”

"Thanks," Shinji smiled a small smile. Then he noticed something different about the redhead, "Asuka, where's your wheelchair?"  
“谢谢，”真嗣微微一笑。随后他注意到红发女孩有些不同，“明日香，你的轮椅呢？”

A wide grin bloomed on her already beautiful face, making it now look angelic. "I'm recovered, see," she stood up from the chair, although her knees were still a little bit wobbly, "turns out after I synced with my EVA that has a fine spine my brain fixed itself, or something like that," Asuka sat down again. "Though my muscles still need recovery. I haven't used them since…then," she pointed at two clutches placed at the corner of the ward. "I'll have to use those instead until my legs are fully recovered."  
她那本就美丽的脸上绽放出一个灿烂的笑容，现在看起来宛如天使。“我恢复了，你看，”她从椅子上站了起来，尽管膝盖还有些摇晃，“似乎在我与那有着完美脊柱的 EVA 同步后，我的大脑就自我修复了，或者类似那样，”明日香又坐了下来。“虽然我的肌肉还需要恢复。自从那次之后，我就没再用过它们，”她指向病房角落里的两根拐杖。“在我双腿完全恢复之前，我得用这些代替。”

Shinji felt a huge stone had been lifted off his shoulders. The disastrous battle now seemed to yield more promising results than bad ones. "Good job, Asuka. Defeating the Angel, I mean," he let out a sigh of relief. "You saved us…saved me."  
真嗣感到肩上的重担终于卸下了。这场灾难性的战斗现在看来，结果比坏的更有希望。“干得好，明日香。我是说，打败了使徒，”他松了一口气。“你救了我们……救了我。”

"Hmph, I'm the great Asuka Langley Soryu, after all." She boasted. "And…" A smug smirk crept up her face. "Now I'm officially tied with you in Angel kill counts!"  
“哼，毕竟我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷嘛。”她自夸道。“而且……”她脸上浮现出一丝得意的笑容。“现在我在使徒击杀数上正式和你打平了！”

Shinji chuckled. Of course Asuka was still Asuka. "How did you manage to re-sync with your EVA, anyway?" It was another question he needed to know. Though from the looks of it, she didn't actually realize her mother was in there, otherwise she wouldn't be here with him in such a good mood.  
真嗣轻声笑了。当然，明日香还是那个明日香。“你是怎么重新与 EVA 同步的？”这是他需要知道的另一个问题。虽然从她的表情来看，她似乎并没有意识到她母亲就在里面，否则她不会在这里和他如此愉快地交谈。

Asuka's expression turned ponderous. "I…I had a talk with the EVA…it doesn't make sense anyway. I just found the right way to 'open up', I suppose."  
明日香的表情变得沉思。“我……我和 EVA 谈了谈……反正这也不合逻辑。我想我只是找到了‘打开’它的正确方式。”

With a hiss, the door of the ward slid open, revealing Dr. Akagi clad in a white lab coat behind it. "Oh, glad to see you awake, Shinji," the blonde doctor said. "How do you feel?"  
随着一声轻响，病房门滑开了，露出穿着白色实验服的赤木律子博士。“哦，很高兴看到你醒了，真嗣，”金发博士说道，“感觉如何？”

"Alive and whole, I guess," Shinji checked his bodily functions and was happy to found them all working fine. "When can I go home?"  
"活着而且完好无损，我想，" 真嗣检查了自己的身体机能，高兴地发现一切正常。"我什么时候可以回家？"

"As soon as you feel fit enough. I've already done the necessary tests, anyway." She said casually before a sly grin appeared on her face. "Actually, you'd better get going soon. She has been by your side ever since you came here." She glanced at Asuka. "I suppose she's really _hungry_ right now."  
"只要你感觉足够健康就可以。反正我已经完成了必要的测试。" 她随意地说道，随后脸上露出一丝狡黠的笑容。"实际上，你最好尽快离开。自从你来到这里，她就一直守在你身边。" 她瞥了一眼明日香。"我想她现在真的很饿。"

Asuka blushed, "well, I just want to be here when he wakes up so I can get him home and make me dinner as soon as possible, nothing more!"  
明日香脸红了，"嗯，我只是想在他醒来时在这里，这样我就能尽快带他回家并让他给我做晚饭，没别的！"

Shinji winked, "is that so? But you just said-"  
“真的吗？但你刚刚还说——” 真嗣眨了眨眼。

"Shut it, alright," Asuka huffed, her blush deepening with each passing second.  
“闭嘴，行不行，”明日香气呼呼地说，她的脸颊随着每一秒过去而越发红润。

Even though Shinji had had countless childish bickering with her to the extent he hardly found them amusing anymore, yet like an old joke that hadn't been heard in a long time, seeing that Asuka was confident and prideful just somehow brought down a ray of sunshine onto Shinji during this time of unexpected darkness.  
尽管真嗣与明日香之间幼稚的争吵已经多到他几乎不再觉得有趣，但就像许久未听的老笑话，看到自信骄傲的明日香，在这突如其来的黑暗时刻，不知为何给真嗣带来了一束阳光。

At the moment, Dr. Akagi's phone started to vibrate. She picked up her device and looked at the text message that just came through, and sighed. "Shinji," she started, glancing at the boy. Upon receiving a small nod, she continued, "the commander requires your immediate presence."  
此刻，赤城博士的手机开始震动。她拿起设备，看着刚刚收到的短信，叹了口气。“真嗣，”她开口道，目光瞥向男孩。在得到一个小小的点头后，她继续说，“指挥官要求你立即前往。”

Shinji silently sighed. He had been expecting this, but didn't think his father would be so impatient. "Asuka, come with me, then. We have some stuff to discuss." Ritsuko Akagi said to the redhead before turning her head to Shinji once again, giving him an almost sympathetic look, as if saying 'good luck'.  
真嗣默默叹息。他早有预感，但没想到父亲会如此急切。“明日香，跟我来吧，我们有事要讨论。”赤城律子对红发女孩说道，随后再次转向真嗣，给了他一个近乎同情的眼神，仿佛在说‘祝你好运’。

Something he knew he really needed right now.  
他知道，这正是他现在非常需要的。

Sighing, Shinji entered Gendo Ikari's office with a dejected, yet determined expression on his face. His father had requested his immediate presence as soon as he woke up, which meant he wanted some serious explanations. Shinji knew after the last disastrous battle such interrogation was inevitable. Therefore he had been preparing his answers ever since he opened his eyes.  
叹了口气，真嗣带着沮丧却又坚定的表情走进了碇源堂的办公室。他的父亲在他醒来后立即要求他到场，这意味着他需要一些严肃的解释。在经历了上一场灾难性的战斗后，真嗣知道这样的审问是不可避免的。因此，自从他睁开眼睛以来，他一直在准备自己的答案。

He felt a shiver ran down his spine as the freezing atmosphere mainly produced by Commander Ikari's stern look assaulted him, the fact that he knew probably nothing good would come out of this conversation only made it worse. "Father," he started, fixing his eyes on his father, who clapped his hands together, covering his chin like usual.  
当他感受到由碇司令严峻目光所营造的冰冷氛围侵袭而来时，他的脊背不禁一阵发凉，他知道这场对话很可能不会有什么好结果，这使得情况更加糟糕。“父亲，”他开口道，目光紧盯着他的父亲，后者像往常一样双手合十，遮住了下巴。

"You will give me a thorough explanation of the last battle," Gendo Ikari spoke up. Even though the Angel was defeated, the situation was still too grim to his likings.  
“你将给我详细解释上一场战斗的情况，”碇源堂开口道。尽管使徒已被击败，但局势仍然严峻到令他不悦。

"My apologies first, father," Shinji summoned all of his willpower to withstand the invisible pressure his father was weighing on him and succeeded; he would never be able to do it if not for the fact that his actual age might be older than him. "I grew careless and omitted crucial details."  
"首先向您道歉，父亲，" 真嗣用尽所有意志力来抵御父亲无形中施加给他的压力，并成功了；若非他实际年龄可能比父亲还大，他永远无法做到这一点。"我一时疏忽，遗漏了关键细节。"

"Hm," Gendo narrowed his eyes by a hair. "I thought you should already know how to fight each Angels without any problem."  
"嗯，" 源渡微微眯起眼睛。"我以为你应该已经知道如何毫无问题地对抗每一位使徒了。"

"Indeed I know, however," Shinji's expression turned more serious, "that doesn't mean the Angels would be weaker in strength. This Angel had always been one of the most powerful ones, so I thought fighting it on land would be easier." It was a lie he needed to say under this situation.  
"我的确知道，然而，" 真嗣的表情变得更加严肃，"这并不意味着使徒的力量会减弱。这个使徒一直是最强大的之一，所以我认为在陆地上战斗会更容易。" 在这种情况下，他不得不说出这个谎言。

"Our deal includes you helping me with the scenario, but it seems even Angels are giving you a hard time right now, let alone SEELE," Gendo huffed.  
“我们的协议包括你帮我处理这个局面，但看来现在连使徒都让你头疼不已，更别提 SEELE 了，”碇源堂哼了一声。

"Some of the Angels…are really powerful," Shinji sighed, maintaining his poker face. "If I didn't have foreknowledge…things would end even faster, father."  
“有些使徒……真的很强大，”真嗣叹了口气，保持着扑克脸。“如果我没有预知……事情会结束得更快，父亲。”

Gendo Ikari pondered for a moment. Even though he was still suspicious, he couldn't deny that there was still a possibility he was telling the truth. "How can I make sure this won't happen again?"  
碇源堂沉思片刻。尽管他仍心存疑虑，但他不能否认这仍有可能性是真话。“我如何确保这种情况不会再发生？”

"I don't have any incentive to do otherwise, do I?" Shinji frowned. "If I fail against the Angels, Asuka could be hurt."  
"我没有理由不这么做，不是吗？" 真嗣皱眉道，"如果我输给了使徒，明日香可能会受伤。"

"Hm," Gendo pondered for a moment. How could he forget about the Second Child? He had to admit his son had a valid point. He really had no reasons to intentionally fail against the Angels. "Unit 01 is a crucial part of the scenario, and I'm sure you're aware of that."  
"嗯，" 碇源堂沉思片刻。他怎么忘了第二适格者？他不得不承认儿子说得有道理。他确实没有理由故意输给使徒。"初号机是计划的关键部分，我相信你很清楚这一点。"

"The Angel was defeated, and Asuka can pilot again," Shinji stood his ground. "I'd actually say the battle yielded a better result than it could have."  
"使徒已被击败，明日香也能再次驾驶了，" 真嗣坚定地说，"实际上，这场战斗的结果比预期的还要好。"

Gendo's gaze softened at another reminder of the positive reality. "Still, I want to see some materialized help." If all the 'help' he could bring him was merely winning against the Angels, then it would be unsatisfactory, considering his time traveler status.  
碇司令的目光在又一次提醒下变得柔和，意识到积极现实的正面影响。“不过，我希望能看到一些实质性的帮助。”如果他能带来的‘帮助’仅仅是战胜使徒，那么考虑到他身为时间旅行者的身份，这将是令人不满意的。

"Well, right now I actually have one," Shinji smirked, silently blessing the impeccable timing of the event. "Two weeks later a group of people would try to sabotage NERV's power generator to help SEELE test out NERV's capabilities and learn about NERV's layout. Catch them before they can do anything would provide a huge advantage in the final battle against SEELE."  
“嗯，现在我确实有一个，”真嗣微微一笑，默默感谢这完美的事件时机。“两周后，一群人将试图破坏 NERV 的电源发电机，以帮助 SEELE 测试 NERV 的能力并了解其布局。在他们行动之前抓住他们，将在最终对抗 SEELE 的战斗中提供巨大优势。”

"This is…indeed valuable intel," a subtle smirk appeared on Gendo's face. This was something he needed at the moment, an actual strike on SEELE. "This will do for now."  
“这……确实是有价值的情报，”碇司令脸上浮现出一丝微妙的笑意。这是他目前需要的，对 SEELE 的实际打击。“暂时就这样吧。”

"Also, the ninth Angel will attack during that time…without power, the situation could be dangerous," Shinji continued, internally sighing in relief. "But this time, if NERV could catch the saboteurs, with a working NERV HQ the Angel could be defeated easily."  
"而且，第九使徒会在那时发动攻击……没有电力，情况可能会很危险，" 真嗣继续说道，内心暗自松了口气。"但这次，如果 NERV 能抓住破坏者，拥有完好运作的总部，使徒就能轻易被击败。"

"I've heard the same thing last time," Gendo's voice turned cold again. "Make sure it won't happen this time."  
"上次我也听到了同样的话，" 碇源堂的声音再次变得冷酷。"确保这次不会再发生。"

"I know what I have to do," Shinji said in a firmer voice. "Anything else?"  
"我知道我该做什么，" 真嗣用更坚定的声音说道。"还有其他事吗？"

"No. You're dismissed." "不，你可以走了。"

Shinji let out a long sigh of relief after he exited Gendo's office. It went better than he had expected.  
真嗣在离开源渡的办公室后长长地松了一口气。情况比他预想的要好。

"Long story short, we've reactivated your pilot status after your last sortie," Ritsuko Akagi kept her subdued professionalism as she debriefed the Second Child. "Moreover, NERV Germany isn't demanding you back anymore. Not that we would let you go, considering your importance as a pilot to us."  
"简而言之，我们在你上次出击后重新激活了你的驾驶员身份，"赤城律子保持着她那低调的专业态度，向二号机驾驶员汇报情况。"此外，德国 NERV 也不再要求你回去了。考虑到你对我们作为驾驶员的重要性，我们也不会让你离开的。"

"Well, I don't expect anything less," said Asuka, smirking pridefully. Everything was turning in a better direction, wasn't it? Even though she was worried about Shinji at that time, right now the pride and joy of winning the impossible battle overwhelmed nearly all other feelings.  
“哼，我可不指望会有什么不同，”明日香得意地笑着说。一切都在朝着更好的方向发展，不是吗？尽管那时她对真嗣感到担忧，但此刻战胜不可能之战的骄傲与喜悦几乎淹没了所有其他情感。

She was once again an Ace pilot who saved the day with style, just like what she aimed for. She even had her legs again, which meant she could be independent on most of the things once more.  
她再次成为了那个以风格拯救世界的王牌飞行员，正如她所追求的那样。她甚至重新拥有了双腿，这意味着她可以再次独立处理大多数事情。

Then what else did she need?  
那么，她还需要什么呢？

The image of a certain boy crossed her mind at the thought. She hated having these types of feelings. She hated it all. She just wished that she could hate everyone and be alone forever so that way no one could ever hurt her. But whether she liked to admit it or not, she didn't want to be alone.  
每当想到那个男孩，她的脑海中就会浮现出他的形象。她讨厌这种感觉。她讨厌这一切。她只希望自己能恨所有人，永远孤独，这样就没人能再伤害她了。但不管她愿不愿意承认，她并不想孤独。

Still, she knew she could only hurt him if she ever let him any closer than what they had right now, and she already did. She cared about him, and she thought maybe it was for the best for her to keep him at arms-length. What's more, she also knew he would only hurt her as well, just like all people before did.  
尽管如此，她知道如果让他比现在更亲近，只会伤害到他，而她已经这样做了。她在乎他，她认为也许保持距离对她最好。更重要的是，她也知道他只会像之前那些人一样伤害她。

Now that she had her EVA again, she could live with being alone. After all, she had been alone ever since that one day.  
现在她又有了 EVA，她可以忍受孤独。毕竟，自从那一天起，她就一直是一个人。

"Tadaima." "我回来了。"

Extreme mental exhaustion couldn't be helped but radiated from Shinji's voice as he entered the apartment. The recent events strike him like a rain of meteors, leaving no room or time for him to catch so much as a breath. What's worse, his father seemed to get impatient and suspicious about his 'help'. In reality, there wasn't so much he could do except defeating the Angels like flipping a coin, but he even started to fail against them, something that almost never happened before in his other cycles.  
极度的心理疲惫无法掩饰地从真嗣的声音中流露出来，他走进公寓时如此。最近的事件如流星雨般打击着他，让他连喘息的空间和时间都找不到。更糟糕的是，他的父亲似乎对他的‘帮助’越来越不耐烦和怀疑。实际上，除了像抛硬币一样击败使徒，他并没有太多能做的，但现在他甚至开始在这些战斗中失败，这在之前的循环中几乎从未发生过。

Fortunately, Kaji's little sabotage group sent by SEELE could be said as a timely assist to him.  
幸运的是，加持由 SEELE 派遣的小型破坏小组可以说是及时的帮助了他。

In retrospect, the team of saboteurs did nothing good to the scenario, if not impeding it, not to mention the risk they brought since the ninth Angel attacked so coincidentally. This time with NERV that would be running at full capacity, and an Angel as weak as Matarael wouldn't stand a chance against them.  
回想起来，那群破坏者对局势毫无益处，即便没有阻碍，他们带来的风险也不容忽视，尤其是在第九使徒如此巧合地袭击时。这次 NERV 将全力运转，像 Matarael 这样虚弱的使徒根本无法与之抗衡。

"What took you so long?" A slightly annoyed voice pressed the emergency stop button of Shinji's train of thoughts. He lifted his head and saw his favorite redhead was looking at him with a slight scowl on her face, hands on her hips. "I'm starving, go make me some dinner!"  
“你怎么这么慢？”一个略带不悦的声音按下了真嗣思绪的紧急停止键。他抬起头，看到他最喜欢的红发女孩正双手叉腰，微微皱眉地看着他。“我饿死了，快去做晚饭！”

"I had some serious business to attend to," he stretched the truth to the limit.  
“我有些重要的事要处理，”他尽可能地夸大了事实。

Asuka huffed. "Well, now that you're back, stop wasting time and get to it!"  
明日香哼了一声。“好了，既然你回来了，别浪费时间，快点开始吧！”

Shinji frowned as he noticed a subtle change in Asuka's attitude. Not too long ago, the same person was smiling at and thanking him with gratefulness, and now she even started _demanding_ things. Shinji could feel cold sweat forming on his forehead as he failed to read her behaviors. He thought after him taking care of her and giving her what she needed at the time, their relationship would turn into a better direction, not the opposite.  
真嗣皱起眉头，注意到明日香态度上的微妙变化。不久前，同一个人还对他微笑并充满感激地向他道谢，现在她甚至开始要求这要求那。真嗣感到额头上冷汗直冒，因为他无法理解她的行为。他以为，在他照顾她并给予她当时所需之后，他们的关系会朝着更好的方向发展，而不是相反。

Still, one thing he was sure of.  
不过，有一件事他是确定的。

She started pushing him away.  
她开始推开他。

His eyelids dropped after he took a glance at the clutch leaned against the wall of the living room. Even though technically, according to schedule today was Asuka's turn to make meals, he couldn't bring himself to reject her…request under her current condition.  
他瞥了一眼靠在客厅墙边的手提包后，眼皮垂了下来。尽管按照计划，今天本应是明日香做饭的日子，但他无法在她的这种状态下拒绝她的……请求。

How could he refuse her…how was he worthy of her…for what he had done to her?  
他怎能拒绝她……他何德何能……竟对她做了那样的事？

Replacement? Second chances? Shinji chuckled. Why was he even doing all this? He wanted redemption, but he could never earn her forgiveness…because she's gone.  
替代品？第二次机会？真嗣轻声笑了。他为何要这么做？他渴望救赎，却永远无法得到她的原谅……因为她已经不在了。

Whether or not Asuka noticed the storm of emotions wasn't important to him anymore. Shinji walked to the kitchen without another word and started doing one of the best things he could do, while the redhead at first fixed an odd gaze at his back until he disappeared around the corner, then sighed and went to watch TV.  
明日香是否察觉到他内心的风暴，对他来说已不再重要。真嗣一言不发地走向厨房，开始做他能做的最好的事情，而红发少女起初用奇怪的目光盯着他的背影，直到他在拐角处消失，然后叹了口气，去客厅看电视。

Moments later, the hissing sound of the front door opening captured the attention of the two roommates. "Tadaima!" Misato's cheerful voice filled the apartment, lighting up the atmosphere in an instant. "Oh, hi Asuka! Where's Shinji?"  
片刻后，前门打开的嘶嘶声吸引了两位室友的注意。“我回来了！”美里欢快的声音充满了公寓，气氛顿时活跃起来。“哦，嗨明日香！真嗣呢？”

The said girl used her thumb pointed in the direction of the kitchen while keeping her eyes focused on the screen, and at the same time "Making dinner!" Could be heard. Misato nodded, "by the way, your next sync test is scheduled to be on next Monday."  
那女孩用拇指指向厨房的方向，眼睛却紧盯着屏幕，同时可以听到她说：“在做晚饭！”美里点点头，“顺便说一下，你的下一次同步测试安排在下周一。”

"Great!" Asuka exclaimed in joy, a sky-to-earth contrast to her previous gloomy mood.  
“太好了！”明日香欢呼道，与之前的阴郁情绪形成了天壤之别。

Shinji raised an eyebrow. "Sync test?"  
真嗣挑了挑眉。“同步测试？”

"Oh, she hasn't told you yet?" Said Misato as she came to the fridge for a beer. "Asuka's now active pilot again, so she can't skip sync tests anymore."  
“哦，她还没告诉你吗？”美里说着走向冰箱拿啤酒，“明日香现在又恢复为现役驾驶员了，所以她不能再跳过同步测试了。”

Now it all made sense to him. Asuka had her EVA again, her life's purpose. He was wondering what had happened between now and then for her to change her attitude so drastically. Knowing how much of a treasure she regarded her connection to the EVA, Shinji now understood that her pride must've stood up again. That could only lead to one thing…  
现在这一切对他来说都变得合情合理了。明日香重新获得了她的 EVA，她生命中的目标。他在想，从现在到那时之间发生了什么，让她如此彻底地改变了态度。知道她对与 EVA 的联系有多么珍视，真嗣现在明白了她的骄傲一定又重新树立起来了。这只能导致一件事……

And he was pretty ambivalent on that.  
对此他感到相当矛盾。

"I think the Shinji-sama should've figured it out by himself, right?" Asuka huffed. "After all, I saved the day, including his sorry ass."  
“我觉得真嗣大人应该自己想明白的，对吧？”明日香哼了一声。“毕竟，是我救了这一天，包括他那可怜的屁股。”

Shinji shook his head. He knew piloting the EVA meant almost everything to her, at least before they got together. He could've asked his father to reactivate her pilot status, of course; but ultimately, she relied on her actual ability to pilot to confirm her own usefulness. In fact, she would've deemed it as pity if NERV let her have the name of a pilot while she couldn't activate the EVA.  
真嗣摇了摇头。他知道驾驶 EVA 对她来说几乎意味着一切，至少在他们在一起之前是这样。他本可以请求父亲重新激活她的驾驶员身份，当然；但最终，她依靠自己实际的驾驶能力来确认自己的有用性。事实上，如果 NERV 让她拥有驾驶员的名号却无法启动 EVA，她会认为这是怜悯。

Now though, she had every reason, and every right to pilot again. Even though debonding Asuka and her EVA was always a prioritized task for him to do, he couldn't bring himself to do it…not right after the last battle.  
但现在，她有充分的理由和权利再次驾驶。尽管解除明日香与她的 EVA 的绑定一直是他的优先任务，但他无法让自己这么做……尤其是在上一场战斗之后。

"Well, I'm just glad that you made it, Asuka," smiling a careful smile, Shinji picked up the dishes and brought them to the dining table.  
“嗯，我很高兴你来了，明日香。”真嗣小心翼翼地笑了笑，拿起盘子带到餐桌旁。

Asuka's expression turned thoughtful before a smirk crossed her face, "Of course you should be happy! After all, I'm a better pilot, having me in battle would reduce your workload, Ja?"  
明日香的神情变得若有所思，随即嘴角勾起一抹笑意，“你当然应该高兴！毕竟，我是个更优秀的驾驶员，有我在战斗中会减轻你的负担，对吧？”

"That's not what I meant, Asuka," still, he had to try. "I'm glad that you're okay, and your legs are working fine right now."  
“我不是那个意思，明日香，”他还是得尝试解释，“我很高兴你没事，而且你的腿现在也恢复得很好。”

He could clearly see the ambivalence in Asuka's eyes as she swallowed something she wanted to say. She bit down on her lips, looking down at the table, before digging into the meal. Shinji's mood improved a little as he saw Asuka wolfing down the food before her.  
他清楚地看到了明日香眼中的矛盾，她咽下了原本想说的话。她咬了咬嘴唇，低头看着桌子，然后开始用餐。看到明日香狼吞虎咽地吃着面前的食物，真嗣的心情稍稍好转了一些。

After all, it was one thing he could do for her to make her happy.  
毕竟，这是他能为她做的，让她开心的一件事。

"I'm finished." Said Asuka before she put down her utensils and stood up from the table. "Also…I think we should probably stop sleeping together, since I… don't need your assistance anymore, it would be inappropriate." She glanced at Misato, who was compromising a lot just by letting them sleep together.  
“我吃完了。”明日香放下餐具，从桌边站起身说道，“还有……我想我们应该停止一起睡了，既然我……不再需要你的帮助，那样就不合适了。”她瞥了一眼美里，美里能让他们同床共枕已经做出了很多妥协。

To her surprise, instead of the disappointment and sorrow she expected to see from him, Shinji simply smiled a warm smile and nodded. "If that makes you comfortable, sure."  
令她惊讶的是，他并没有表现出她预想中的失望和悲伤，真嗣只是温暖地笑了笑，点头同意：“如果这样让你感觉舒服，当然可以。”

In fact, he actually felt a little bit happy that she grew out of clinging to him as if he was a life-saving straw.  
事实上，她不再像抓住救命稻草一样依赖他，他反而感到一丝高兴。

Asuka's lips became a thin line. She nodded as well before turning to her own room.  
明日香的嘴唇抿成了一条细线。她也点了点头，然后转身回到自己的房间。

The subtle hint of sadness in her eyes went unnoticed by the preoccupied boy.  
她眼中微妙的悲伤，被心事重重的男孩忽略了。

## *Chapter 17*: Chapter 17: Interlude I  
*第十七章*：第十七章：间奏一

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》

**Chapter 17: Interlude I: Should I want him?  
第十七章：间奏一：我该渴望他吗？**

I finally lifted my eyelids after three long rounds of alarm ringers. Yawning, I grumbled in annoyance and waited for the alarm to be disabled. But it never stopped blaring. I frowned. Normally it should…  
在经历了三遍漫长的闹铃轰炸后，我终于抬起了眼皮。打着哈欠，我恼怒地咕哝着，等待闹钟被关闭。但它却从未停止尖叫。我皱起了眉头。通常它应该……

Oh. He wasn't sleeping with me anymore.  
哦，他不再和我一起睡了。

It had been a while since I _asked_ him to sleep apart, but I guess old habits die hard. I even thought 'normally'. Shameful that I got used to somebody else taking care of me…I should be independent and not rely on anyone.  
自从我要求他分开睡已经有一段时间了，但我想旧习难改。我甚至开始“正常”思考。羞愧的是，我习惯了有人照顾我……我应该独立，不依赖任何人。

I got up from my bed that felt too big for me and stretched my limbs. A glance and the clock told me it was seven in the morning. Today was a Monday, and I had to go to school. Therefore, I quickly got a change of clothes and exited my bedroom, heading to the bathroom to start my morning routine.  
我从那张大得让我感觉不适的床上起身，伸展四肢。瞥了一眼时钟，告诉我现在是早上七点。今天是星期一，我得去上学。因此，我迅速换了衣服，走出卧室，前往浴室开始我的早晨例行程序。

When I crossed the kitchen area, I saw Shinji already up and cooking breakfast like usual. Even though I wanted to be independent, I could give this a pass.  
当我穿过厨房区域时，看到真嗣已经起床，像往常一样在做早餐。虽然我想保持独立，但这一幕还是可以接受的。

He just cooked too good of a meal. I couldn't resist it. At all. I even willingly took all his chores in exchange for him cooking all the meals.  
他做的饭菜实在太美味了。我完全无法抗拒。甚至心甘情愿地接下了他所有的家务活，以换取他负责所有餐食。

During the first few days after the battle, I was somewhat uncomfortable being around him for obvious reasons. In a way, I rejected him, and I was scared that he would get angry with me and leave me. But he didn't. Instead, he continued to be friendly with me as if he wasn't influenced by my bitchy moves. What did I do to deserve this?  
战斗后的头几天，因为显而易见的原因，我在他身边总感到有些不自在。某种程度上，我排斥他，害怕他会因此对我发火并离开我。但他没有。相反，他一如既往地对我友好，仿佛并未受到我那些刻薄举动的影响。我何德何能，能得到这样的对待？

For some reason I didn't know, today he seemed more nervous than usual. Before he would hum some songs while cooking, but today he just worked in silence, the small smile he wore all the time to tell other people – or perhaps only to me - that he felt happy was nowhere to be seen as well.  
不知为何，今天他似乎比平时更加紧张。以往他会在做饭时哼唱几首歌，但今天他却只是默默地忙碌着，那一直挂在脸上、用来告诉别人——或许只是对我——他感到开心的微笑，也消失不见了。

"Good morning," I said as I shoved my messy long hair behind my ears. "Morning," Shinji replied as if he was on autopilot, still focused on the breakfast…or rather thoughts in his head.  
“早上好，”我一边说着，一边将凌乱的长发捋到耳后。“早，”真嗣机械地回应，依旧专注于早餐……或者说，是他脑海中的思绪。

One thing that confused me was his rapidly shifting personality. One moment before, he could be competitive or even antagonistic to me; the next second, he was totally nice and kind. Sometimes even wimpy. Were they only his façades to hide his secrets?  
让我感到困惑的一点是他的性格变化无常。前一刻他还可能对我充满竞争意识甚至敌意；下一秒就变得完全友善和蔼。有时甚至显得懦弱。这些难道只是他用来隐藏秘密的伪装吗？

Speaking of which…I think I could understand him-  
说到这个……我想我能理解他——

It. Understand it. 它。理解它。

Still, he shared something with me, didn't he? For some unspoken reason, the girl he talked about constantly nagged at me, and his mother…he told me his mother was dead the day we met.  
尽管如此，他还是与我分享了一些东西，不是吗？出于某种未言明的原因，他经常提及的那个女孩总是让我心烦意乱，还有他的母亲……他告诉我，我们相遇的那天，他的母亲已经去世了。

I shook the thoughts off and continued from where I left off. After I finished washing and cleaning, I came out of the bathroom and went straight for breakfast. Toast and scrambled eggs with a cup of milk as a supplement, just the way I liked it. "Slept well last night?" He asked as he put down his own portion on the table.  
我甩开这些思绪，从刚才停下的地方继续。洗漱整理完毕后，我走出浴室，直接去吃早餐。吐司、炒蛋，外加一杯牛奶作为补充，正是我喜欢的搭配。“昨晚睡得好吗？”他放下自己的那份早餐，问道。

I pondered for a moment. The first few days where I slept alone weren't as bad as I had expected, and I almost relinquished the idea that it was Shinji who took my nightmares away.  
我沉思片刻。最初独自入睡的几天并没有我预想的那么糟糕，我几乎要放弃那个念头，认为正是真嗣带走了我的噩梦。

Almost. Until they came back again.  
差点就成功了。直到他们再次回来。

"Not too bad, I guess," I lied. Though I knew my swollen eye bags and red eyes betrayed me as I saw the suspicion in his look. However, he made no remarks and dug into his meal. I let out a small sigh.  
“不算太糟吧，我想。”我撒了谎。尽管我知道我肿胀的眼袋和红肿的眼睛已经出卖了我，从他眼神中的怀疑就能看出来。然而，他并未多言，只是埋头吃饭。我轻轻叹了口气。

On the bus ride to school, we often would chat about random stuff. He always seemed to have endless topics to talk about, which intrigued me. I thought boys at his age were all perverts who think with their genitals, not brains. He made a special exemption, I had to admit.  
在去学校的公交车上，我们常常会闲聊些无关紧要的事情。他似乎总有说不完的话题，这让我感到好奇。我原以为他这个年纪的男生都是下半身思考的变态，而不是用脑子。他算是个例外，我不得不承认。

"Hi Asuka!" I was greeted by the enthusiastic class representative as I entered the classroom. After the battle with Sandalphon I had a lot of time to think. I felt guilty for pushing her away simply because she said the wrong thing at the wrong time. I knew she wasn't malicious; she was only trying to be helpful.  
“嗨，明日香！” 我一进教室，就被热情的班长迎接了。与桑达菲翁一战后，我有大量的时间去思考。我因为她在不恰当的时机说了不恰当的话而推开她，感到内疚。我知道她并无恶意，只是想帮忙而已。

"Hello Hikari," I greeted back somewhat listlessly, still haunted by the nightmare last night. Sitting down on my chair, I opened my laptop and checked my inbox. I snorted as I saw dozens of new date requests that occupied my screen. Without second thoughts, I discarded all of them like I always did.  
“你好，光，”我有些无精打采地回应，昨晚的噩梦仍萦绕心头。坐到椅子上，我打开笔记本电脑，检查邮箱。看到屏幕上挤满了数十个新的约会请求，我不禁嗤之以鼻。毫不犹豫地，我像往常一样将它们全部删除。

I am an elite pilot who saved the world single-handedly; I don't have time to deal with immature kids who only want to grope a cheap feel on me. Even if I wanted to date someone, Shinji would be my first and only choice.  
我是一名单枪匹马拯救世界的精英驾驶员；我没有时间应付那些只想在我身上占便宜的不成熟孩子。即使我想约会，真嗣也会是我的首选，也是唯一的选择。

And that would likely mean relying on him once again, which I didn't want to.  
而这很可能意味着我不得不再次依赖他，这是我所不愿的。

"Rise! Bow! Sit!" The Sensei came in and continued lecturing on how meaningful and colorful pre-impact life was. I despised it at first since it was so dull that it made me extremely sleepy. My opinion had changed, though. Soon I found out that the benefit of him being repetitive was he also didn't care about what the students do. So I could utilize the time as I preferred and not suffer any form of homework, which was a waste of my time since I couldn't learn anything new from it.  
“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”老师走了进来，继续讲述着冲击前生活的意义和多彩。起初我对此深恶痛绝，因为它枯燥至极，让我昏昏欲睡。但我的看法改变了。很快我发现，他重复性的讲课方式的好处在于，他也不在乎学生们在做什么。因此，我可以随心所欲地利用这段时间，而不必承受任何形式的作业，那些作业对我来说纯属浪费时间，因为我从中无法学到任何新东西。

It seemed like many people had the same ideas as me.  
似乎很多人都有和我一样的想法。

A _horde_ of admirers and fans started sending PMs to me, mainly praising me for how I defeated the Angels. The day I came back to school after the battle against the eighth Angel, I began bragging about how every other pilot failed while I saved their asses and the world as their last line of defense. Of course people complimented and praised me; not too long ago this would have made my day, but I didn't enjoy it as much recently. In fact, now they annoyed me to the extent I regreted bragging about it in the first place.  
一群崇拜者和粉丝开始给我发私信，主要是赞扬我如何击败了使徒。在与第八使徒战斗后返校的那天，我开始吹嘘其他驾驶员都失败了，而我作为最后一道防线拯救了他们的屁股和世界。当然，人们会赞美我；不久前这会让我一整天都开心，但最近我并没有那么享受。事实上，现在这些赞美让我感到厌烦，甚至后悔当初吹嘘。

What's this…emptiness that I felt?  
这种……空虚感是什么？

Just a small 'thank you' from Shinji…outweighed thousands of meaningless and hollow praises I received from other students.  
仅仅是一个来自真嗣的小小‘谢谢’……就胜过了我从其他学生那里收到的无数空洞无意义的赞美。

Why?

Because they didn't understand me like Shinji could. The feeling of losing your legs inside an EVA was something they'd never experience. Getting boiled alive by a high-energy particle beam? Not in a million years. Not to mention-  
因为他们不像真嗣那样理解我。在 EVA 中失去双腿的感觉，他们从未体验过。被高能粒子束活活煮沸？一百万年也不会有。更不用说——

The lunch bell to me sounded the most pleasant melody in the world; today we would have a sync test, which meant we could leave school after lunch. "Ikari? Could you please come here for a second?" I turned my head in the direction of the voice and saw Sensei waving his hand feebly at Shinji, who nodded in acknowledgment and walked to the podium. They talked about stuff I couldn't hear clearly, still, I caught several phrases like 'advanced education' and 'your father'. I grew curious.  
对我来说，午餐铃声是世界上最悦耳的旋律；今天我们要进行同步测试，这意味着午饭后就可以离开学校了。“碇君？你能过来一下吗？”我顺着声音的方向转过头，看到老师无力地向真嗣挥手，真嗣点头示意后走向讲台。他们谈论着我听不清楚的事情，但我还是捕捉到了几个词，比如‘高级教育’和‘你父亲’。我变得好奇起来。

"Shinji, what you were talking about with Sensei?" I probed as I, wondergirl, and Shinji walked on our way to NERV HQ. Sweat dripped down from my body, soaking my school uniform. To say that the day was hot was like simply saying EVAs are 'big'.  
“真嗣，你刚才和老师谈了些什么？”我一边问，一边和真嗣以及明日香走在去 NERV 总部的路上。汗水从我身上滴落，浸湿了我的校服。说今天很热，就像简单地说 EVA‘很大’一样。

Well, EVAs aren't 'big'. They are _colossal_.  
嗯，EVA 可不算‘大’。它们是巨型的。

"He asked me if I want to participate in an advanced education program, and he wanted to talk about it with my…guardian." He replied nonchalantly as if he had already expected it to happen.  
“他问我是否想参加一个高级教育项目，并希望与我的……监护人谈谈。”他漫不经心地回答，仿佛早已预料到会发生这种事。

It was another thing that slightly irritated me. Shinji always got full grades on all subjects and made it look easy by submitting the exams earlier than everyone else. Since I sat near him, I observed him answering the questions one time. The way he filled the answer sheet… I'll put it this way: he might as well be copying straight from the solutions sheet. Damn it, I was supposed to be the most intelligent person in the school! Even though my Kanji had improved a lot thanks to his assistance, I still had no chance to surpass him.  
这又是让我略感恼火的一点。真嗣总是在所有科目上取得满分，并且总是比其他人提前交卷，显得轻而易举。有一次我坐在他旁边，观察他答题。他填答案的方式……这么说吧：他简直就像直接从答案纸上抄的一样。该死，我本该是学校里最聪明的人！尽管在真嗣的帮助下，我的汉字水平有了很大提高，但我仍然没有机会超越他。

"Good for you, someday you may get enrolled into a college early, just like me," I tried to remind myself that I should still be superior in terms of educational level.  
"干得好，总有一天你也许能像我一样提前进入大学，"我试图提醒自己，在教育水平上我仍应保持优越。

We continued to trek down the road. Shinji had been tense and nervous all the way, as if he was walking toward some expected doom. Even though I wanted to push him away, his sore mood started affecting me as well. "How about we go buy some ice cream? The weather is cooking me alive," I pointed at a small shop on the side of the street.  
我们继续沿着路走下去。真嗣一路上都紧张不安，仿佛正走向某种预料中的厄运。尽管我想把他推开，但他糟糕的情绪也开始影响我。"我们去买点冰淇淋怎么样？这天气热得我快熟了，"我指着街边的一家小店说。

"Good idea," he smiled a small smile for the first time of the day, turning to the grocery store.  
"好主意，"他今天第一次露出了微笑，转向杂货店。

The first thing he did after entering the store was to look at the clock. I knew he valued punctuality, but I felt this was a little bit overboard. When we left the school, we still had several hours to spend along the way, after all.  
他进店后做的第一件事就是看了一眼时钟。我知道他很看重守时，但我觉得这有点过头了。毕竟，我们离开学校时，还有好几个小时可以在路上消磨。

To my surprise, he let out a sigh of relief, his face visibly lit up. The cool temperature produced by the buzzing air-conditioning of the store must've soothed his dismal mood, I supposed. "Strawberry flavor," I said.  
令我惊讶的是，他松了一口气，脸上明显亮了起来。我想，店里空调发出的凉爽温度一定舒缓了他糟糕的心情。“草莓味。”我说。

"Vanilla please." “请给我香草的。”

"…"

"Wondergirl?" I turned around to look at the First Child, who was staring into nothingness like usual. I sighed, "Ayanami?"  
"奇迹少女？" 我转过身，看向那位总是凝视虚无的首位孩子。我叹了口气，"绫波？"

"Yes, Asuka?" She blinked and looked at me. Good.  
"什么事，明日香？" 她眨了眨眼，看向我。很好。

"What flavor do you fancy? Ice cream, I mean."  
"你喜欢什么口味的？我是说冰淇淋。"

"I do not deem eating ice cream necessary."  
"我认为吃冰淇淋并非必要。"

I found myself at a loss for words. Well, she had always been acting like this, so I couldn't really blame her. As much as I knew she wasn't actually a doll since she could show emotions in her own weird way, I still felt annoyed by her indifferent attitude.  
我一时语塞。好吧，她总是这样，我也不能真的怪她。尽管我知道她并非真的像玩偶一样，因为她能以自己古怪的方式表达情感，但她那种漠不关心的态度还是让我感到恼火。

"Ayanami, not everything you do should be 'necessary', alright? Sometimes you do things for your own likings and interest." Of course, Shinji would say it to her. "Your suggestion is…acceptable." I felt tightness grow inside my chest as I saw wondergirl's lips curled up a bit at his words, at which he smiled his own smile. Damn it, he's mine-  
“绫波，不是你做的每件事都得是‘必要的’，好吗？有时候你做事情是为了自己的喜好和兴趣。” 当然，真嗣会对她说这些。“你的建议……可以接受。” 当我看到奇迹女孩听到他的话后嘴角微微上扬，他也回以微笑时，我感到胸口一阵紧缩。该死，他是我的——

No. He's not mine anymore. I pushed him away, didn't I? So why was I complaining? I at least deserved it.  
不。他不再是我的了。是我推开他的，不是吗？那我为什么还在抱怨呢？至少这是我应得的。

I forever only had myself and my EVA.  
我永远只有自己和我的 EVA。

We continued marching toward the entrance of the Geofront. The sunshine grew increasingly baking with each passing moment, so when I saw the shadow cast by the gigantic dome of Geofront entrance, I rushed to the place. Leaning on the cool metal wall, I panted heavily and wiped out the sweat on my forehead. Shinji and wondergirl came in together moments later. I took out my NERV ID card and swiped it through the slot of the identification device. A green passing sigh showed up with an acute 'beep' sound, and the door opened. We entered the Geofront and took the train elevator.  
我们继续向 Geofront 的入口行进。阳光越来越炽热，每走一步都感觉更加烤人，所以当我看到 Geofront 入口巨大穹顶投下的阴影时，便急忙跑了过去。倚靠在冰凉的金属墙边，我大口喘着气，擦去额头上的汗水。不久后，真嗣和那个女孩一起走了进来。我拿出 NERV 的 ID 卡，在识别装置的插槽上刷了一下。随着一声尖锐的‘哔’声，绿灯亮起，门打开了。我们进入了 Geofront，乘坐列车电梯。

"Just you wait, Shinji. I'll beat you in this sync test!" I boasted, partially trying to get myself psyched up for it. Last time my sync rate was only 0.5 percent lower than the invincible Shinji-sama's, and while I was improving with each test, he seemed to hold at a specific threshold. Today would be my best chance.  
“等着瞧吧，真嗣。这次同步测试我一定会赢你！”我夸口道，部分也是为了给自己打气。上次我的同步率只比无敌的真嗣大人低了 0.5 个百分点，而且随着每次测试，我都在进步，而他似乎停滞在一个特定的阈值。今天将是我最好的机会。

"We'll see about that, Asuka," he said back with a smirk, his mood visibly brighter than before. What changed? Did that ice cream cast a spell on him? Or was it-  
“那我们就拭目以待吧，明日香，”他带着一丝得意的笑容回应，情绪明显比之前高涨了许多。是什么改变了？是那冰淇淋对他施了魔法吗？还是别的什么——

My musings were interrupted by a distant yet undoubtedly sound of cartridge explosion. "Did…did you hear that?" I lowered my volume. Nodding, Shinji's turned his expression grim instantly, "that was…gunfire."  
我的沉思被远处传来的，确凿无疑的弹药爆炸声打断。“你……你听到了吗？”我压低了声音。点头间，真嗣的表情瞬间变得凝重，“那是……枪声。”

As if aroused by his words, I could hear several more rounds of pistol firing, mixed with sidearms and sub-machine guns. "What the fuck?" I shouted in a whisper. "Are we under an armed invasion or something?!"  
仿佛被他的话唤醒，我能听到更多手枪射击声，夹杂着副武器和冲锋枪的声音。“搞什么鬼？”我低声惊呼，“我们是被武装入侵了吗？！”

"I advise we hurry to the EVA cages." Wondergirl cut in at the moment. As much as I hated to admit it, she had an absolute point. Ironically, the inside of our entry plugs could be both the safest and most dangerous places in the world.  
“我建议我们赶紧去 EVA 格纳库。”绫波零此时插话道。尽管我讨厌承认，但她的话确实有道理。讽刺的是，我们的插入栓内部可能是世界上最安全也最危险的地方。

Fortunately, we didn't encounter any foes on our way to the EVA cages. There were groups of armed security troops patrolling the area, a sight I had never seen before. "Misato!" I called out as I saw the Captain of NERV standing in front of the Evangelion Chamber, Kaji was there with her as well. "What the hell is going on?!"  
幸运的是，我们在前往 EVA 笼的路上没有遇到任何敌人。武装安全部队的小组正在该区域巡逻，这是我从未见过的景象。“美里！”我看到 NERV 的队长站在福音战士机库前，加持也在她身边。“这到底是怎么回事？！”

"Thank god you are all okay kids!" She pulled Shinji and me into a light hug. The warm sensation temporarily wiped out my nervousness; maybe Misato did care about me…  
“谢天谢地，你们都平安无事！”她轻轻地拥抱着真嗣和我。那温暖的触感暂时消除了我的紧张；也许美里真的在乎我……

"There's a small group of armed soldiers inside NERV HQ, sabotaging our facilities."  
“有一小队武装士兵潜入了 NERV 总部，正在破坏我们的设施。”

"They've already destroyed the communication system, but luckily we caught them before they could do anything worse."  
“他们已经破坏了通讯系统，但幸运的是，我们及时阻止了他们进一步的行动。”

As I processed the shocking information Misato told me, I could obviously see the anxiousness in Kaji. "Kaji-san, what are you doing here?" I asked. I didn't feel like clinging to him anymore, for whatever reasons, and I actually felt slightly liberated that I no longer have the urge to seduce him by any means.  
当我消化着美里告诉我的惊人消息时，我明显能看出加持的焦虑。“加持先生，你在这里做什么？”我问道。我不再有任何理由依附于他，实际上，我感到一丝解脱，不再有通过任何手段诱惑他的冲动。”

"Ah, Katsuragi wanted to talk with me for something, so I came along. When we got inside the elevator, it was when the gunfire started. We thought you all have a sync test today, so here is the most probable place you'll come."  
“啊，葛城想和我谈些事情，所以我来了。当我们进入电梯时，枪战就开始了。我们以为你们今天有同步测试，所以这里是最有可能来的地方。”

I noticed the almost invisible smirk that crept up Shinji's face as if he was the person behind the curtain.  
我注意到真嗣脸上几乎难以察觉的窃笑，仿佛他就是幕后操纵的那个人。

"Well, I guess an Angel attack would be the worst thing that could happen right now…" I remarked offhandedly.  
“嗯，我想现在最糟糕的事莫过于使徒来袭了……”我随口说道。

Then the Angel alarm blared.  
接着，使徒警报响起了。

Speaking of the devil… 说曹操曹操到……

"Just fucking wonderful…" Misato mumbled in exasperation. "Get into your respective entry plugs!" We were already on our feet before she spoke the command, though. I felt I was turning hot-blooded as I changed into my plugsuit. Another Angel. Another opportunity to shine. Another chance to declare my usefulness to the world. Another evidence that I could be independent. Not to mention I would surpass Shinji in terms of Angel kill counts if I got this one by myself.  
“真是糟糕透顶……”美里恼怒地咕哝着，“各自进入插入栓！”她还没下令，我们就已经站起来了。我换上插入栓服时，感觉自己热血沸腾。又一个使徒。又一个展现自我的机会。又一个向世界证明我有用的机会。又一个证明我能独立存在的证据。更别提如果我独自干掉这个使徒，就能在使徒击杀数上超过真嗣。

I sat in my entry plug and waited impatiently. "EVA LAUNCH!" Ooooo…when she shouted that, I swore she was the most attractive woman in the world. A wave of a feeling of overweight assaulted me as the launch shaft shot upwards with me and my EVA.  
我坐在插入栓里，焦急地等待着。“EVA 发射！”当她喊出这句话时，我发誓她是世界上最迷人的女人。随着发射井向上疾射，一股沉重感袭来，我和我的 EVA 一同冲向战场。

I settled my eyes on the Angel as soon as I came to the surface since its size was disproportionately large. It has four disturbingly long legs and a round, pea-shaped body. Its spherical body was covered by numerous yellow eyes, and all of the ones I could see seemed to be focusing in on me, making me cringe.  
我一浮出水面，目光便立刻锁定在那只天使身上，因为它的体型大得不成比例。它有四条长得令人不安的腿和一个圆润的豌豆形身体。它那球形的身体上布满了无数黄色眼睛，我能看到的所有眼睛似乎都在盯着我，让我不禁皱眉。

I looked over at my teammates, who were standing not far away from me, assuming a combat stance. I grabbed a progressive spear while Unit 01 held a pallet rifle in his hand, and Unit 00 crouched into a sniping position, holding a sniper rifle. I liked how they gave me the leading attack role; I was the best pilot, after all.  
我瞥了一眼不远处的队友们，他们摆出了战斗姿态。我抓起一把渐进式长矛，零号机手持一把板条箱步枪，初号机则蹲伏成狙击姿势，手持狙击步枪。我喜欢他们让我担任主攻角色；毕竟，我是最优秀的驾驶员。

"I've got this," I said into the comms before pushing the controls forward. "Asuka, don't be so reckless!" If it weren't for the worry that literally radiated from his voice, I would've thought he only wanted to halt my attack and claim the kill himself. Still, I didn't hesitate and continued charging forward. I leaped into the air while pushing my AT-Field against the Angel's, neutralizing it without too much trouble. So far, this Angel seemed weak. I grinned and brought the spear down onto its body.  
“我能搞定。”我对着通讯器说道，然后向前推动操纵杆。“明日香，别这么鲁莽！”如果不是他声音中明显流露出的担忧，我可能会以为他只是想阻止我的攻击，自己抢夺击杀。尽管如此，我并未犹豫，继续向前冲锋。我跃入空中，同时用 AT 力场对抗天使的力场，毫不费力地将其中和。到目前为止，这只天使似乎很弱。我咧嘴一笑，将长矛刺向它的身体。

Upon contact, I saw globs of yellowish liquid burst out from the gigantic wound inflicted by my spear. Initially I thought it was LCL, but the fact that my weapon melted and turned into smoke made me think otherwise. "It's acid!" I shouted into the microphone as I tried to jump away from the Angel, but it was too late.  
接触瞬间，我看到从那巨大的伤口中喷涌出黄色的液体。起初我以为是 LCL，但我的武器融化成烟的事实让我改变了想法。“是酸！”我对着麦克风大喊，试图跳离使徒，但为时已晚。

I screamed in pain as acid rained down onto my EVA, the crucifying burning sensation on my back felt like millions of ants stinging. I summoned all of my remaining consciousness to roll aside, away from the imminent danger.  
我痛苦地尖叫，酸雨倾泻在我的 EVA 上，背上的灼烧感如同千万只蚂蚁叮咬。我用尽剩余的意识向一旁翻滚，远离迫在眉睫的危险。

"Providing suppressive fire." Came wondergirl's monotone voice as I saw a round of 406mm armor-piercing shells burst out from the muzzle of her sniper rifle, heading toward the Angel at sonic speeds. With me still holding up my AT-Field, the Angel failed to raise its own and took the bullets with its soft body tissues.  
“提供压制火力。”明日香那平淡的声音传来，我看到她狙击枪的枪口喷出一轮 406mm 穿甲弹，以超音速射向使徒。在我仍支撑着 AT 力场的同时，使徒未能展开自己的力场，用柔软的身体组织承受了子弹。

Unlike the last Angel we fought, this one visibly possessed weaker body strength. The metal shells tore its skin and flesh apart without issue; tons of LCL mixed with acid surged out from the holes created by the impacts. My heart sank as I saw the red core through the wounds at the center of its body cracked and exploded.  
与上次我们战斗的那个天使不同，这个天使明显拥有较弱的身体力量。金属弹壳毫不费力地撕裂了它的皮肤和肌肉；大量的 LCL 混合着酸液从撞击造成的孔洞中涌出。当我看到它身体中央的红色核心通过伤口裂开并爆炸时，我的心沉了下去。

Damn it. This one was indeed an easy kill. And wondergirl stole it from me.  
该死。这个确实是个容易的击杀。而那个神奇女孩从我手中抢走了它。

Even though I felt I should hate her for stealing the kill, I couldn't. I knew it wasn't her intention; she only followed the orders. If anything, I only had my own carelessness and bad luck to blame on.  
尽管我觉得我应该因为她抢走了击杀而恨她，但我做不到。我知道那不是她的意图；她只是服从命令。如果有什么，我只能怪自己的粗心和坏运气。

I sighed in disappointment and willed my damaged EVA back to the retrieval points. It wasn't a big deal at all. I could've killed the Angel by myself, that I was sure of. Therefore, I could probably deal with the next one just as quickly, and I didn't intend to lose the opportunity twice.  
我失望地叹了口气，催动受损的 EVA 返回回收点。这根本不算什么大事。我确信自己本可以独自消灭那个使徒。因此，我大概也能同样迅速地对付下一个，我可不打算两次错失机会。

I _will_ kill the next Angel by myself.  
我将独自消灭下一个使徒。

Asuka Langley Soryu would _not_ lose.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷绝不会输。

The three of us pilots sat back on a grassy ledge overlooking the architectural marvel that's Tokyo-3 as the moon rose and the blanket of night took over. "I wonder why there are so few stars in the sky?" Suddenly Shinji's half-questioning voice came to me. I scoffed and crossed one leg over the other, rolling my eyes. "It's called the light pollution, idiot. If the city doesn't have lights, you would see a lot more stars." Strangely, I didn't expect him to ask such a simple question, considering his extraordinary performance in school. Maybe he used it as a conversation opener, I didn't know.  
我们三个驾驶员坐在草坡上，俯瞰着东京-3 这座建筑奇迹，随着月亮升起，夜幕渐渐笼罩。'不知道为什么天上的星星这么少？' 突然，真嗣半带疑问的声音传入我耳中。我嗤之以鼻，翘起一条腿，翻了个白眼。'那叫光污染，傻瓜。如果城市没有灯光，你会看到更多的星星。' 奇怪的是，我没想到他会问这么简单的问题，毕竟他在学校的表现非同寻常。也许他只是用这个问题作为开场白，我不清楚。

"I do not enjoy being surrounded by brightness. I want to be able to see the stars," I heard wondergirl saying. Frowning slightly, I followed, "well, I enjoy brightness. It should be human's instinct to go after light, wouldn't you say?"  
'我不喜欢被亮光包围。我想看到星星，' 我听到明日香说。我微微皱眉，接着说，'嗯，我喜欢亮光。追逐光明应该是人类的本能，你不觉得吗？'

"I prefer brightness as well," Shinji's voice carried an unmeasurable depth in it. "I hate darkness, but I couldn't escape from it. I tried, but I always fail...the experience, the memories...the unforgiven." He took a glance at me; the pure sadness behind his mask literally poured out from his eyes.  
'我也喜欢亮光，' 真嗣的声音中带着难以估量的深沉。'我讨厌黑暗，但我无法逃离它。我尝试过，但总是失败...那些经历，那些记忆...那些无法原谅的。' 他瞥了我一眼；他面具背后的纯粹悲伤，从眼中倾泻而出。

I suddenly felt incredibly guilty. Was it because of me distancing myself from him? "Why do you like brightness, Asuka?"  
我突然感到无比内疚。是因为我疏远了他吗？“为什么你喜欢明亮，明日香？”

I bit down on my lips. "When I lived in Berlin, I was surrounded by lights. I got used to it, I guess." I felt my mood dropping as I recalled my experience in NERV Berlin. Endless training and work, nothing but...darkness and despair.  
我咬紧了嘴唇。“在柏林生活时，我被灯光环绕。我想我已经习惯了。”回忆起在 NERV 柏林的经历，无尽的训练和工作，除了...黑暗和绝望，我的心情也随之低落。

I found the actual reason for my craving for brightness the same as him.  
我发现我对光明的渴望，原因竟与他相同。

"I also enjoy being around with you as my friends," Rei spoke up abruptly, shutting off my train of thoughts. "Do you enjoy being around with me as well?"  
"我也喜欢和你们这些朋友在一起，" 绫突然开口说道，打断了我的思绪。"你也喜欢和我在一起吗？"

"Of course Ayanami," Shinji's reply came instantly. As for me, although I couldn't exactly say 'enjoy', she was at least a tolerable company. "You're...an okay friend, I guess."  
"当然，绫波，" 真嗣立刻回答道。至于我，虽然不能准确地说'喜欢'，但她至少是个可以忍受的伙伴。"你算是个……还不错的朋友吧。"

Friend. I sneered internally at the thought. A vague term created for ambiguity.  
朋友。我内心冷笑了一下这个想法。一个为了模糊不清而创造的含糊词汇。

"Do you enjoy Shinji-kun's company more than mine, Asuka?"  
"你更喜欢真嗣君的陪伴，而不是我吗，明日香？"

I choked at the unexpected question. The short and simple answer would be capitalized 'YES', but there were more careful considerations. In retrospect, even after I pushed Shinji away, he continued to be friendly to me. All of the achievements I had till today wouldn't be possible if he didn't burst into my room on that day when I attempted suicide and held me tight that night.  
我被这突如其来的问题呛到了。简短直接的回答当然是'是'，但还有更多需要仔细考虑的因素。回想起来，即使在我推开真嗣之后，他依然对我保持友好。如果没有那天他闯进我房间，在我自杀未遂的那个夜晚紧紧抱住我，我今天所取得的一切成就都不可能实现。

Then I closed off myself as soon as I could. He should be mad at me, for I practically used him then dumped him like a broken tool once I grew out of it. Instead, he just took it and...  
然后我尽可能快地封闭了自己。他应该对我生气，因为我几乎利用了他，一旦我不再需要，就像丢弃一个破损的工具一样抛弃了他。然而，他只是默默承受，并且...

In fact, I care about him, a lot. I can even say I like him. But...I don't think I deserve him. I could only hurt him if we move forward, and I'm afraid he would hurt me as well.  
事实上，我很在乎他，非常在乎。我甚至可以说我喜欢他。但是...我觉得自己配不上他。如果我们继续发展，我只会伤害他，而且我也害怕他会伤害我。

I couldn't comprehend; The way he acted toward me, the almost unconditional affection he gave me, reminded me of my momma. But I couldn't accept it.  
我无法理解；他对我的态度，他几乎无条件给予我的爱，让我想起了妈妈。但我无法接受。

I'm not some love-struck teenager who would accept unconditional love from anyone. I can only accept it from momma since she had every reason to love me without second thoughts, but she's already gone. I don't think I can love anyone else other than my mother just because they act as if they love me. I need substantial reasons and proof from them.  
我不是那种会接受任何人无条件爱的痴情少年。我只能接受来自妈妈的爱，因为她有充分的理由毫无保留地爱我，但她已经离开了。我不认为仅仅因为他们表现得好像爱我，我就能爱上除母亲以外的任何人。我需要他们提供充分的理由和证据。

And I fail to know why he would...pamper me. The other girl before me he mentioned…even though he said otherwise, I still couldn't get rid of the feeling that I was only her replacement. It was the only logical conclusion I could come up with.  
我不明白他为何会...宠溺我。他提到我之前的那个女孩……尽管他否认，我仍无法摆脱自己只是她替代品的感受。这是我唯一能得出的合理解释。

And it scares me. 这让我感到害怕。

What if it was only a game he's playing with me?  
如果这只是他和我玩的一场游戏呢？

I know I want him, but _should_ I want him? Do I deserve him? Can I actually love him? Can he understand me like how I want?  
我知道我想要他，但我应该想要他吗？我配得上他吗？我能真正爱他吗？他能像我希望的那样理解我吗？

Not to mention now I had my EVA again, I could live with being alone...an independent elite pilot is what I've always wanted, isn't it?  
更不用说现在我又有了 EVA，我可以忍受孤独……一个独立的精英驾驶员一直是我所渴望的，不是吗？

However, the reason for me piloting was to gather attention from other people...whom I didn't really care about anymore. Then what else should I want?  
然而，我驾驶 EVA 的原因是为了吸引其他人的注意……那些我不再真正关心的人。那么我还应该想要什么呢？

What's stranger, he was willing to give me space as I demanded. He didn't even protest when I said that we should sleep apart. And his respect to my modesty...I didn't even know it existed in the male species.  
更奇怪的是，他愿意按照我的要求给我空间。当我提出我们应该分开睡时，他甚至没有抗议。他对我的矜持的尊重……我甚至不知道这在男性物种中是存在的。

Did that mean he doesn't want me? Or at least he didn't want my body?  
这是否意味着他并不想要我？或者至少他并不想要我的身体？

Everything was so confusing and ambiguous...it frustrated me.  
一切都那么混乱和模糊……这让我感到沮丧。

Even if I want to go further with him, I need to sort out my own feelings at first, shouldn't I?  
即使我想与他更进一步，我也需要先理清自己的感情，不是吗？

Still, I thought I should at least give him something that would tell him that I really cared about him. "I do enjoy Shinji's company. I'd say he's my best friend here, no doubt," I turned my head to him. "So let's keep it that way, okay?"  
尽管如此，我想我至少应该给他一些东西，让他知道我真的很在乎他。“我确实喜欢和真嗣在一起。毫无疑问，他是我在这里最好的朋友，”我转头对他说，“所以让我们保持这样，好吗？”

"Sure. I can say the same thing to you, Asuka." He smiled his trademark grin that I had never seen him show anybody else ever before.  
“当然。我也可以对你说同样的话，明日香。”他露出了那个我从未见他对其他人展示过的标志性笑容。

Shit...I just couldn't...  
该死...我就是做不到...

I closed my eyes and smiled a sad smile of my own.  
我闭上眼睛，露出了自己悲伤的微笑。

**Chapter 19: Turning Point  
第十九章：转折点**

"This is the place," Commander Ikari held his arms out and gazed upon the blood-red sea that was once Antarctica. "Where Adam was awakened, and purified this continent of the original sin."  
"就是这里，" 碇司令张开双臂，凝视着曾经是南极洲的血红色海洋。"亚当在此苏醒，净化了这个大陆的原罪。"

"If by purify you mean the annihilation of half of the human population, then sure," Fuyutsuki snorted, not really buying Gendo's twisted obsession with destruction.  
"如果你所谓的净化是指消灭了半数人类，那确实如此，" 冬月哼了一声，并不真正认同碇源堂对毁灭的扭曲执着。

Gendo ignored Kozo's scolding and returned his gaze to the red ocean. His son had told him to get the Lance of Longinus around this time of the scenario, while he would deal with the incoming Angel himself.  
源度无视了荒巻的责骂，将目光重新投向那片红色的海洋。他的儿子曾告诉他，在这个剧情的时间点上，他需要去获取朗基努斯之枪，而他自己则将亲自应对即将到来的使徒。

Speaking of his son… 说到他的儿子……

Putting his clasped together hands behind his rear, Gendo thought of how similar they were when treating their loved ones. Nothing else in the world mattered more than Yui to him, and from his words, Gendo was sure Shinji was just like him. He would destroy the whole world along with all the lives on the planet and not blink. A chill ran down his spine as Gendo thought of what would happen if they lost the Second Child – what would Shinji do? Annihilate the whole world and go on to another cycle?  
将双手紧扣置于身后，源渡思考着他们在对待所爱之人时的相似之处。对他来说，世界上没有什么比唯更重要，而从他的话语中，源渡确信真嗣也和他一样。他会摧毁整个世界以及星球上的所有生命，并且毫不犹豫。想到如果他们失去了二号适格者会发生什么——真嗣会怎么做？毁灭整个世界并进入下一个循环吗？

_'Like father, like son…'_ Gendo chuckled. _'What would you have become if I didn't abandon you ten years ago?'_  
'有其父必有其子……'源渡轻笑道，'如果十年前我没有抛弃你，你会变成什么样呢？'

"You seem to have a lot of faith in your son," Fuyutsuki's voice interrupted his train of thoughts.  
“你似乎对你的儿子很有信心，”冬月的声音打断了他的思绪。

"Where does that come from?" Gendo's eyes went wide by a millimeter.  
“这从何说起？”源渡的眼睛微微睁大了些。

"He comes to your office a lot," the Sub-Commander of NERV looked up at the sky. "So, picking up father's role again, Ikari? Trying to make it up to him?"  
“他经常来你办公室，”NERV 的副司令抬头望向天空，“所以，源渡，你又重新扮演起父亲的角色了吗？试图弥补他？”

"Hm," his almost questioning words created another tornado of thoughts inside Gendo's head. Who was Shinji to him? A coworker? A subordinate? An 'assistance'? His intel about the sabotage group sent by SEELE really helped him a lot – they didn't get to map the layout of NERV, which would be a considerable advantage to him during the end game between him and SEELE.  
“嗯，”他近乎疑问的话语在源渡脑海中掀起了一场思想的龙卷风。真嗣对他来说是什么？同事？下属？还是‘助手’？他对 SEELE 派来的破坏小组的情报确实帮了大忙——他们没能绘制出 NERV 的布局图，这将在他与 SEELE 的最终对决中成为他的重要优势。

Did he consider him his son anymore?  
他是否还把他视为自己的儿子？

Gendo found the last question hard to answer. Before he wouldn't even hesitate to say he only had faith in himself, and he would think of Shinji as his tool to achieve his reunion with Yui at most, but now…knowing what the other 'Gendos' had done to the Second Child, Shinji's equivalent to his Yui, he couldn't help but feel _guilty_.  
源堂发现最后一个问题难以回答。以前他甚至不会犹豫地说他只相信自己，他会把真嗣看作是实现与唯重聚的工具，但如今……知道其他‘源堂’对二号机驾驶员所做的事情，真嗣相当于他的唯，他不禁感到内疚。

After all, Shinji might be the only one in the world whom he could relate to, to _emphasize_ with.  
毕竟，真嗣可能是世界上唯一一个他能与之产生共鸣、感同身受的人。

Moreover, he wasn't that concerned about Shinji betraying him in the end as much as he did in the beginning. He knew Shinji would go on for another cycle after this one, so why should he care that much? At least, it was something he should worry about later, not now.  
此外，他不像最初那样担心真嗣最终会背叛他。他知道真嗣在这个循环结束后还会继续下一个，那他为什么要如此在意呢？至少，这是他以后应该担心的事情，而不是现在。

_'Shinji…how much did I hurt you?'_ He hated, _loathed_ SEELE for what they did to Yui, which he was sure of. Looking up at the sky, Gendo could hear the announcer of the ship sounding. "This is the bridge. NERV transmission: we've just detected an Angel in earth's orbit above the Indian ocean."  
'真嗣…我究竟伤害了你多少？' 他痛恨、厌恶 SEELE 对唯所做的一切，这一点他确信无疑。抬头望向天空，源堂能听到船上的广播响起。"这是舰桥。NERV 通讯：我们刚刚检测到在印度洋上空地球轨道上有一只使徒。"

As for defeating the Angel, Shinji had told him this one he would deal with it using the method that had never failed before. Gendo had been demanding explanations from him of his failure against the Angels; even though he had failed before, he still trusted him to put in most of his effort every time.  
至于击败使徒，真嗣曾告诉他，这次他将采用之前从未失败过的方法来应对。源堂一直要求他解释对抗使徒失败的原因；尽管他之前失败过，但他仍然相信他会每次都全力以赴。

After all, to Shinji, the only alternative other than winning would be losing the Second Child. And Gendo was sure Shinji would never intentionally let that happen.  
毕竟，对真嗣来说，除了胜利之外的唯一选择就是失去第二适格者。而碇源堂确信真嗣绝不会故意让这种情况发生。

Turning his head to the southern part of the sky, he could faintly see a new star moving across the sky at visible speed, hordes of smaller stars that could be easily identified as N2 aerial mine explosions flashing around it.  
他转头望向南方的天空，隐约可见一颗新星以肉眼可见的速度划过天际，周围无数较小的星光闪烁，显然是 N2 空中水雷爆炸的痕迹。

"Do you have faith in humanity, Fuyutsuki?" Seeing the grey-haired elder nod, Gendo continued, "we shall see how it goes."  
“你对人类有信心吗，冬月？”看到灰发的长者点头，碇源堂继续说道，“我们拭目以待。”

"What?!" Asuka didn't even try to hold her tongue. "You want us to catch it with our hands?!"  
"什么？！" 明日香连掩饰都懒得掩饰，"你要我们用手去抓它？！"

Across the thick glass floor that remained suspended above the Geofront, Misato stood opposite the three EVA pilots. The First Child didn't seem bothered by it, though not thrilled, either. Shinji kept his calm composure, very much like Rei's, only had more determination in his eyes. As for Asuka, she was visibly taken aback by the boldness of the plan.  
在悬浮于地表之上的厚玻璃地板对面，美里站在三位 EVA 驾驶员的对面。第一适格者似乎并不为此感到困扰，但也并不兴奋。真嗣保持着冷静的姿态，与绫波颇为相似，只是眼中多了几分坚定。至于明日香，她显然被这个大胆的计划吓了一跳。

"We need all the three EVAs to cover the estimated impact zone we've calculated using the MAGI. Just catch the Angel before it hits the ground, and you'll be fine." Misato explained casually. "I understand it you don't want to partake in this sortie. If you want to quit, you can tell me right now. No one will blame you."  
"我们需要三台 EVA 覆盖我们用 MAGI 计算出的预计冲击区域。只要在天使落地前抓住它，你们就没事。" 美里随意地解释道，"我理解你们可能不想参与这次出击。如果你们想退出，现在就可以告诉我。没人会责怪你们的。"

"Tch!" She expected that much of a reaction out of Asuka. "I'm not going to let that Angel flatten this place I consider my home!" She smirked proudly. "Besides, after I get this kill my kill count will surpass Shinji's! So why would I chicken out!"  
"哼！" 她预料到明日香会有这样的反应。"我不会让那个使徒毁了我视为家园的地方！" 她得意地笑了笑。"而且，这次击杀后我的击杀数将超过真嗣！那我为什么要退缩呢！"

"Good." Major Katsuragi nodded in satisfaction. "And you, Rei?"  
"很好。" 葛城美里少校满意地点点头。"那么，绫波呢？"

"I accept the mission." Rei's voice was flat as usual.  
"我接受任务。" 绫波的声音一如既往地平淡。

"I see." The Major of NERV turned her head to the last pilot. "Shinji, what about you?"  
"明白了。" NERV 的少校转向最后一位驾驶员。"真嗣，你呢？"

"I'm not going to sit around and let the girls fight that thing by themselves, you know," said Shinji as he glanced at his side where Asuka and Rei stood.  
"我不会坐视不管，让女孩们独自对付那东西，你知道的，" 真嗣说着，瞥了一眼站在他身旁的明日香和绫波。

"Hmph," Asuka stomped her feet on the glass floor. "I don't think I'll need your help, anyway. I can take out this Angel by myself! Just wait and see!"  
"哼，" 明日香在玻璃地板上跺了跺脚。"反正我觉得我不需要你的帮助。我一个人就能干掉这个使徒！等着瞧吧！"

"Well, you're supposed to fill out a will according to the procedures," said Misato as she scanned the document once again.  
“嗯，你应该按照程序填写遗嘱，”美里再次审视了一遍文件，说道。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "I don't need to fill one out. I'm not going to die." "I do not deem it necessary." The blue-haired pilot concurred. "I don't plan on dying today, either, Misato." Shinji followed.  
明日香翻了个白眼。“我不需要填这个。我不会死的。”“我认为没有必要。”蓝发驾驶员附和道。“我今天也不打算死，美里。”真嗣接着说。

The Major, who was keeping a serious face, couldn't help but smile a little. All three of them were faced with an almost astronomical probability of dying, and yet they still stood their ground. "Alright then. Let's get ready!"  
一直保持严肃表情的大校忍不住微微一笑。他们三人面对着几乎天文数字般的死亡概率，却依然坚守阵地。“好吧。那我们准备出发吧！”

Asuka felt the elevator ride down to the EVA cages had to have been the longest one minute of her life. Even though she said otherwise, she couldn't help but feel anxious about what was to come. On the positive side, this could be her ladder to the top one place of Evangelion pilots, her definitive evidence that she could be alone and rely on no one else but herself. On the negative side, she could very likely die in the mission, not to mention Shinji and wondergirl.  
明日香觉得从电梯下降到 EVA 格纳库的那一分钟，绝对是有生以来最漫长的一分钟。尽管她嘴上不承认，但内心深处还是忍不住对即将到来的任务感到焦虑。从积极的一面看，这可能是她通往 EVA 驾驶员顶峰的阶梯，是她证明自己可以独立、无需依赖任何人的确凿证据。从消极的一面看，她很有可能在任务中丧生，更别提真嗣和那个怪女孩了。

Speaking of that idiot…  
说到那个笨蛋……

Her talk with Kaji that day only made her worry more about the situation. Thinking about losing him had always brought a twitch in her stomach, and today…  
那天与加持先生的谈话让她对局势更加担忧。一想到可能会失去他，她的胃就忍不住抽搐，而今天……

"Shinji," the redhead sighed and patted on the boy's right shoulder. "Oi, earth to Shinji!"  
“真嗣，”红发女孩叹了口气，拍了拍男孩的右肩。“喂，真嗣，回神啦！”

"Yes, Asuka?" The brown-haired boy snapped his head in her direction, seemingly just broke out from his own mind world.  
“什么事，明日香？”棕发男孩猛地转头看向她，仿佛刚刚从自己的思绪中挣脱出来。

"You're not allowed to die out there, you got that?" Asuka tried to sound as threateningly as possible. However, the tenderness still flowed out despite her best efforts. "You're my…best friend here, and I don't want you to die because you can't pull yourself together during an Angel attack!"  
"你可不能在那里死掉，明白吗？" 明日香试图尽可能地显得威胁十足。然而，尽管她尽了最大努力，温柔之情依然流露出来。"你是我的……这里最好的朋友，我不希望你因为在一个使徒攻击中无法振作而死去！"

"Sure?" Shinji replied, a bit uncertain of where it came from.  
"真的吗？" 真嗣回答道，对这种情感的来源有些不确定。

"I'm serious," Asuka hissed. "If you die today, I will never forgive you, and I will kill you myself!" Completely ignoring the impossibility of her statement, Asuka continued as courtesy, "and it goes to you, too, wondergirl."  
"我是认真的，" 明日香低声说道，"如果你今天死了，我永远不会原谅你，我会亲自杀了你！" 完全无视她话语中的不可能性，明日香继续以礼貌的口吻说，"还有你，奇迹女孩，也一样。"

"Alright, I promise," Shinji smiled a small smile.  
"好吧，我保证，" 真嗣微微一笑。

"I'll hold you onto that," Asuka smiled back.  
"我会记住你的承诺，" 明日香回以微笑。

"If I die, I can be replaced," came Rei's usual response.  
"如果我死了，我可以被替换，" 丽一如既往地回答道。

Rolling her eyes, Asuka facepalmed and spoke up, "well, I don't even know why I'm worried. Just witness the great Asuka Langley Soryu kick this Angel's ass! Just don't get in my way!" A cocky grin started to find its way to her face.  
翻了个白眼，明日香捂脸叹道，“唉，我到底在担心什么啊。看我，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，把这使徒打得落花流水！别挡我的路就行！”一丝得意的笑容开始在她脸上绽放。

Shinji let out a silent sigh. He could only hope things could go well in this battle.  
真嗣无声地叹了口气。他只能祈祷这场战斗能顺利进行。

The weather seemed to have its own ideas on defeating the Angels, though. Thick overcast that loomed over the entire sky as if deliberately making the mission as difficult as possible. Unit 00, 01, and 02 crouched in a starting position as their pilots awaited Misato's commands to engage in the mission. They had to sortie without umbilical cables to compensate for speed, and under the full-performance mode, the EVA only had 3 minutes of operational time, which meant they needed to kill the Angel fast.  
然而，天气似乎也有自己的想法来对抗使徒。厚厚的云层笼罩着整个天空，仿佛故意让任务变得尽可能困难。零号机、零一号机和零二号机蹲伏在起始位置，它们的驾驶员等待着美里指挥官下达任务开始的命令。他们必须在没有脐带电缆的情况下出击以弥补速度，并且在全性能模式下，EVA 只有 3 分钟的运行时间，这意味着他们需要迅速消灭使徒。

"The Angel has been sighted!" Aoba announced to everyone on the command deck. "Estimated time of impact: five minutes!"  
“使徒已被发现！”青叶向指挥舱内的所有人宣布。“预计接触时间：五分钟！”

"Alright everyone," Misato spoke into the microphone. "Get ready to engage the target." After receiving verbal confirmations from the pilots, the Major continued. "We can only use the MAGI's rough estimated trajectory to get you within ten thousand meters of the target. After that, you're on your own." She took a deep breath. "EVAs launch!"  
“好了，各位，”美里对着麦克风说道。“准备与目标交战。”在收到驾驶员的口头确认后，美里指挥官继续说道：“我们只能利用 MAGI 的粗略估计轨迹让你们接近目标一万米范围内。之后，就靠你们自己了。”她深吸了一口气。“EVA 出击！”

The second their umbilical cables detached, all three EVA Units shot forward, their battery timers slowly counting down. The roaring of thunders could be heard traveling across the sky as the pilots willed their EVAs dart through the fortified metropolis. Each heavy step shook the ground around them, leaving large indentions in the dirt.  
当他们的脐带电缆一断开，三台 EVA 机体便疾驰而出，电池计时器缓缓倒数。雷鸣般的轰响划破天际，驾驶员们操控着 EVA 在加固的都市中穿梭。每一步都震撼着地面，留下深深的足迹在泥土中。

Ayanami controlled her EVA leaped over a series of high-voltage powerlines, not because she was worried about collateral damage; she simply didn't want to waste energy and time on the would-be-lost momentum.  
绫波控制着她的 EVA 跃过一系列高压电线，并非担心附带损害；她只是不想在即将失去的势头中浪费能量和时间。

Asuka seemed to be putting her past track skills to use, leaping over the obstacles like hurdles while not losing the slightest bit of momentum.  
明日香似乎在运用她过去的田径技巧，像跨栏一样跃过障碍物，丝毫没有减慢速度。

"You're now within ten thousand meters of the target!" Major Katsuragi's voice echoed through their Entry Plugs. "It's all up to you now!"  
“你们现在距离目标不到一万米了！”葛城美里少校的声音在插入栓中回响，“接下来就看你们的了！”

Shinji looked up at the sky and tried to spot the Angel. Even though every time it would land around the same place, the uncertainty principle of Quantum mechanics made it certain that minor discrepancies were destined to occur. The airflow of the atmosphere, the effect of solar winds, and other trivial stuff all affected the final trajectory of the Angel.  
真嗣抬头望向天空，试图寻找使徒的踪迹。尽管每次它都会降落在相似的地方，但量子力学的测不准原理使得微小的偏差注定会发生。大气流动、太阳风的影响以及其他琐碎因素，都会影响使徒的最终轨迹。

Fortunately, something as colossal as the Tenth Angel wasn't going to be influenced that much.  
幸运的是，像第十使徒这样庞大的存在，并不会受到太大的影响。

Shinji took the most direct route to where he knew the Angel would land around, no hurry in his pace since he knew he would have plenty of time left.  
真嗣选择了最直接的路径前往他预知使徒会降落的区域，步伐不急不缓，因为他知道自己还有充足的时间。

That was until he saw Asuka picking up her speed and broke the sound barrier as he heard a loud BANG of the sonic boom.  
直到他看到明日香加速并突破了音障，随即听到一声响亮的音爆巨响。

Inside the entry plug of Unit 02, Asuka watched intently at the sky, trying to locate where the thunders were the densest. If the displacement of clouds created thunders, then those areas must be where the Angel was falling from. She had the determination to kill this Angel by herself, and she would put in her best effort to achieve it.  
在二号机插入栓内，明日香紧盯着天空，试图找出雷电最密集的地方。如果云层的移动产生了雷电，那么那些区域必定是使徒坠落的地方。她决心独自消灭这个使徒，并将全力以赴实现这一目标。

Gritting her teeth, Asuka willed her EVA picking up speed more and more, even though she had already surpassed Mach 1. Unit 02 dashed with extreme speed towards the point of impact, destroying everything along its way. Asuka had no idea an Evangelion was capable of such speeds, but now wasn't exactly the best time to question it. Once she reached the location the Angel was descending to, she reared her feet back and slid on her heels, digging the EVA's feet into the ground while she held her arms firmly up to the sky. "AT-Field Maximum!"  
咬紧牙关，明日香催动她的 EVA 不断加速，尽管她已经超过了音速。02 号机以极速冲向撞击点，沿途一切尽被摧毁。明日香从未想过 EVA 能达到如此速度，但现在显然不是深究的时候。一旦到达天使降临的位置，她后退一步，脚跟滑动，将 EVA 的双脚深深插入地面，同时双臂坚定地举向天空。“AT 力场，全开！”

The clouds above her began to disperse as the giant eye forced its way through the thunderstorm, colliding directly onto Unit 02's AT Field. At first, Asuka tried to use one of her arms to pull out her progressive knife, but the mountain-like pressure quickly made her perish the thought. She bellowed out in pain as she could feel her arms began failing against the weight of the vast Angel.  
头顶的云层开始散开，巨大的眼睛强行穿透雷暴，直接撞击在 02 号机的 AT 力场上。起初，明日香试图用一只手臂拔出她的高振动粒子刀，但山一般的压力很快让她打消了这个念头。她痛苦地大喊，感觉到自己的双臂在天使的沉重压迫下开始支撑不住。

"YYAAAAHHH!" Asuka cried as she summoned all of her strength, trying to merely stand up straight. The Angel sensed the obstacle below it and contracted its body, using the inertia to push itself down further.  
“呀啊啊啊！”明日香竭尽全力嘶喊，试图仅仅站直身体。天使感知到下方的阻碍，收缩身体，利用惯性进一步向下压。

Asuka could feel her left knee gave in as she fell down into a kneeling position. No matter how hard it was for her to admit it, she didn't stand the slightest of a chance against the Angel alone.  
明日香感觉到左膝一软，跪倒在地。无论多么难以承认，她独自一人面对使徒毫无胜算。

Throwing all of her pride and shame aside, Asuka screamed.  
抛开所有的骄傲与羞愧，明日香尖叫起来。

"SHINJI! AYANAMI! I NEED YOUR HELP! PLEASE HURRY!"  
“真嗣！绫波！我需要你们的帮助！请快点！”

Shinji felt a cold ball grow inside his stomach as he heard the desperate pleading of his love over the comms. "Asuka, hold on!" He yelled into the comm channel, hoping to give at least mental support. Then, breaking the sound barrier, Unit 01 rushed atop the hill where Unit 02 was holding the Angel on and deployed its own AT-Field. Rei joined shortly after, using its prog knife to tore a cut on the Angel's AT-Field, opening it just enough for Shinji to reach through.  
听到通讯器中爱人绝望的恳求，真嗣感到一股寒意在胃里凝结。“明日香，坚持住！”他对着通讯频道大喊，希望能给予至少精神上的支持。随后，突破音障，初号机疾驰至山顶，与零号机一同牵制使徒，并展开了自己的 AT 力场。绫波紧随其后，利用高振动粒子刀在使徒的 AT 力场上撕开一道口子，为真嗣创造出足够穿透的机会。

Unit 01 pulled out its own prog knife as well and aimed at the Angel's eye. "Now die!" Shinji roared, thrusting the ultra-sharp blade through the hole in the AT Field and cutting into the core located in its pupil.  
初号机也拔出了自己的高频振动刀，瞄准使徒的眼睛。“现在去死吧！”真嗣咆哮着，将超锋利的刀刃穿过 AT 力场的缺口，切入位于其瞳孔中的核心。

Suddenly, Asuka could feel all the force pressing against her let off as the Angel became nothing more than dead weight. She looked up to see Shinji pull the knife out of the monster's core, causing a spew of LCL to drench the three EVAs. A resounding shriek could be heard from the Angel as its body began to expand and bubble before it exploded into a giant ball of fire.  
突然间，明日香感觉到所有压在她身上的力量都消失了，使徒变成了毫无生气的重物。她抬头看到真嗣从怪物的核心中拔出刀刃，导致大量 LCL 喷涌而出，将三台 EVA 淋湿。使徒的身体开始膨胀并冒泡，随后发出一声震耳欲聋的尖叫，爆炸成一个巨大的火球。

Back in NERV HQ, Misato let out a breath that she didn't know she was holding, falling back onto the chair, resting her right hand atop her forehead. People around her exploded into cheers as she recomposed herself. "Phew, that was close." She grabbed the microphone, "Good work you three." She spoke into the device, not bothering hiding the joyfulness and appreciation in her voice the slightest. "We'll send a recovery team to pick you up."  
在 NERV 总部，美里长长地呼出一口气，她甚至没意识到自己一直在屏息，向后倒在椅子上，右手放在额头上。周围的人们爆发出欢呼声，她重新振作起来。“呼，真是千钧一发。”她拿起麦克风，“你们三个干得漂亮。”她对着设备说道，丝毫不掩饰声音中的喜悦和感激之情。“我们会派回收队伍去接你们。”

No one noticed a certain redhead who curled up to a ball in her pilot seat.  
没有人注意到一个红发女孩蜷缩在她的驾驶座上，像一个球一样。

Asuka had been tossing and turning on her bed for the past hour, yet sleep wouldn't come. The nightmare she had just woken up from was the worst one she had ever since...they started sleeping apart.  
明日香已经在床上辗转反侧了一个小时，但睡眠依旧不肯降临。她刚刚从噩梦中醒来，这是自他们开始分开睡以来最糟糕的一次。

Her mind drifted back to today's battle against the Tenth Angel. The fact that she lost another chance to claim her top spot of Evangelion pilots wasn't bothering her as much anymore; the real killer was her unavoidable dependence on people other than herself.  
她的思绪飘回到今天与第十使徒的战斗。失去再次夺回 EVA 驾驶员榜首位置的机会，这件事已经不再像以前那样困扰她了；真正让她感到痛苦的是，她无法避免地依赖着除自己以外的人。

She could only found solace in the fact that she was the leading role in the sortie, the one who held the sky for her teammates.  
她只能从自己是出击中的主角，是为队友撑起天空的那个人这一事实中找到慰藉。

Nonetheless, her illusion that she didn't need anyone and only rely on her EVA now seemed like a cosmic joke to her.  
尽管如此，她曾经认为自己不需要任何人，只依靠 EVA 的想法，现在对她来说就像是一个宇宙级的笑话。

As Asuka stared at the ceiling above her, all the frustration, loneliness, emptiness, and anxiousness came crashing down on her just like what the Angel did today, making her suffocate more with each passing second.  
当明日香凝视着头顶的天花板时，所有的挫败感、孤独、空虚和焦虑如今天使所做的那样，一股脑儿地向她袭来，每过一秒都让她更加窒息。

The redhead let out an irritated groan. If she had already relied on him once, one more time wouldn't be too much of a deal. Even though it would make her appear needy, even pathetic since she was the one who pushed him away, she couldn't care less about it right now.  
红发女孩发出了一声烦躁的呻吟。如果她已经依赖过他一次，再多一次也不算太过分。尽管这会让她显得需要帮助，甚至有些可怜，毕竟当初是她推开了他，但此刻她已经顾不了那么多了。

Having made a decision, Asuka got off her bed and left her room. Tiptoeing across the hallway, she carefully slid Shinji's room door open and entered the small closet. At first glance, she thought he was sleeping, so she had decided only to sleep next to him and left the room before he could wake up. However, after she lay down, she could hear him gasp in surprise. Asuka silently cursed, but there was no chickening out anymore.  
下定决心后，明日香从床上起身，离开了房间。她踮着脚穿过走廊，小心翼翼地推开真嗣的房门，进入了那个小衣橱。起初，她以为他在睡觉，所以决定只是躺在他旁边，并在他醒来之前离开房间。然而，当她躺下后，却听到他惊讶的喘息声。明日香暗自咒骂，但现在已经没有退缩的余地了。

"Baka-Shinji, can I stay here for tonight? I'd rather not be alone right now."  
"笨蛋真嗣，今晚我能留在这里吗？我现在不想一个人。"

"Sure..." Came Shinji's sleepy response. However, his actions were not so sloppy. He turned around and put one of his arms over her waist, dangling down to her abdomen.  
""当然可以..."" 真嗣睡意朦胧地回答。然而，他的动作并不马虎。他转过身，一只手臂搭在她的腰间，垂落到她的腹部。

Asuka tensed up, "I didn't say you could hold-"  
明日香紧张起来，""我没说你可以抱——"

"Asuka," Shinji cut her off with a firmer voice. "You came here because you had a nightmare, right? I just had one, too. We did this before and I can say we both enjoyed it, so let's keep the bad dreams away from both of us, okay?"  
“明日香，”真嗣用更坚定的声音打断了她。“你来这里是因为做了噩梦，对吧？我也刚做了个噩梦。我们以前也这样做过，而且我可以说我们都从中得到了乐趣，所以让我们一起把噩梦赶走，好吗？”

As much as she wanted to retort, she couldn't bring herself to do it since she was indeed relishing in the warmth and the familiar physical contact. Melting into his embrace, Asuka smiled a little and let out a content sigh.  
尽管她很想反驳，但她确实沉浸在这温暖和熟悉的身体接触中，无法自拔。在真嗣的怀抱中融化，明日香微微一笑，发出满足的叹息。

Though it didn't help to wipe out the insecurities in her head. Now she was once again relying on him, but was it the right thing to do? "Shinji," she started, her voice uncertain. "Who...am I to you?"  
虽然这并没有消除她内心的不安。现在她又一次依赖他，但这样做对吗？“真嗣，”她开口，声音带着不确定。“我……对你来说是谁？”

"You're my best friend, why ask?"  
“你是我的好朋友，为什么要问？”

"Don't give me that!" Asuka snapped. "I want your honest answer: why do you care about me?!"  
"别跟我说那些！" 明日香厉声道，"我要你老实回答：你为什么关心我？！"

Shinji fell silent for a moment. What should he say? Not the actual truth - that he was sure of. Or could he tell the reason why he was attracted to Asuka Langley Soryu in the first place? "Because...I feel you're the only one who can understand me, Asuka." The said girl went wide-eyed. "No one else could understand what being an EVA pilot is like. All they see is the shining front. The pain we suffer, the risks we take..." He trailed off as his voice became more sorrowful. "Aside from you're pretty, of course." Chuckling, Shinji added.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿。他该说什么呢？不是真正的真相——这一点他很确定。还是说他最初被惣流·明日香·兰格雷吸引的原因？"因为...我觉得你是唯一能理解我的人，明日香。" 明日香瞪大了眼睛。"没人能理解成为 EVA 驾驶员的感受。他们只看到光鲜的一面。我们所承受的痛苦，我们所冒的风险..." 他的声音越来越悲伤，渐渐低沉下去。"当然，你也很漂亮。" 真嗣轻笑一声补充道。

_'So he wasn't objectifying me...'_ Asuka felt warmth growing inside her chest. Unlike most of the boys she encountered in school, Shinji saw her as a person, not just a hot foreign exotic girl.  
'所以他并没有物化我...' 明日香感到胸中涌起一股暖意。与学校里大多数男生不同，真嗣把她看作一个有血有肉的人，而非仅仅是一个性感的异国美女。

With that being said, she was still flattered by his acknowledgment of her figures. "What about wondergirl? She's a cute butt, and an EVA pilot as well," Asuka probed.  
尽管如此，她还是对他的认可感到受宠若惊。“那 wondergirl 呢？她有个可爱的屁股，还是个 EVA 驾驶员，”明日香试探道。

"Actually...I see her more of a sister," replied Shinji truthfully.  
“实际上……我更多把她看作是妹妹，”真嗣真诚地回答。

Somehow his admissions made Asuka feel more relieved. _'So he treats her as a sister? Then does it mean he treat me as...'_ Before her train of thought could reach its final destination, though, Shinji started up again. "Asuka...all I want to say is you don't have to be alone. There's life outside of EVA...have you ever considered playing music?"  
不知为何，他的坦白让明日香感到更加安心。‘所以他把她当妹妹看待？那是不是意味着他把我当作……’然而，在她思绪到达终点之前，真嗣又开口了。“明日香……我只想说，你不必孤单一人。EVA 之外还有生活……你有没有考虑过玩音乐？”

"Huh? Music? Like, instruments?" Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Why?"  
"嗯？音乐？像乐器那种吗？" 明日香挑了挑眉。"为什么？"

"Because you need a life outside the EVA world, me too," said Shinji as he relished in the scent of strawberry shampoo emitted from her long red hair.  
"因为你需要在 EVA 世界之外的生活，我也一样，" 真嗣说着，享受着她长长的红发散发出的草莓洗发水的香味。

"But I don't have time for it!" Frowning slightly, Asuka raised her volume a little bit. "Besides, there're more Angel attacks right now!"  
"但我没时间搞这些！" 明日香微微皱眉，提高了些音量。"再说，现在天使袭击更频繁了！"

"What did I say about life outside of EVA, Asuka? Getting away from it and have fun while you can is the point." Shinji patiently led her. "Don't you ever get tired?"  
"我在 EVA 之外的生活是怎么跟你说的，明日香？远离它，趁还能享受时尽情玩乐才是重点。" 真嗣耐心地引导她。"你难道不觉得累吗？"

Tired? From the EVA, or from maintaining the masks? Asuka felt he was questioning both. Getting no responses from her, Shinji continued, "You're tired...but you won't do anything about it. That happened to me once, too."  
累？从 EVA 中解脱，还是维持那些面具？明日香觉得他两方面都在质疑。见她没有回应，真嗣继续说道，"你感到疲惫...但你却不采取任何行动。我也曾有过这样的经历。"

"You can understand me, Asuka."  
"你能理解我，明日香。"

The redhead mused. Was it the real reason for his unrealistic affection for her? He thought she could understand him...but could he comprehend her like how she wanted? She didn't want sympathy from anyone. "Shinji...you told me your mother is dead...right?"  
红发少女沉思着。他对她那不切实际的情感，真的是出于这个原因吗？他以为她能理解他...但他又能像她所期望的那样理解她吗？她不希望从任何人那里得到同情。“真嗣...你告诉过我你妈妈去世了...对吧？”

"Yeah..." Came his sullen reply. "She died...after an incident with the EVA." Asuka blinked in shock. "And my father...abandoned me afterward." Shinji knew this was the time, Asuka was trying to open up to him. If he didn't offer his support right now, she would go down her downward spiral once again, and there was no way he would allow it to happen.  
“嗯...”他闷闷不乐地回答。“她是在一次 EVA 事故后去世的。”明日香震惊地眨了眨眼。“而我父亲...在那之后抛弃了我。”真嗣知道这是关键时刻，明日香正试图向他敞开心扉。如果他现在不给予支持，她将再次陷入那螺旋下降的状态，他绝不允许这种情况发生。

"My momma...died as well, also after an accident with the EVA..." Asuka slowly let the words flow out. If he could be honest with her, if he could open up to her, she could as well. "And my father...hooked up with another woman right after...and I was ignored."  
“我妈妈...也是在一次 EVA 事故中去世的...”明日香缓缓地吐露着这些话。如果他能对她坦诚，如果他能向她敞开心扉，她也可以。“而我父亲...就在那之后和另一个女人在一起了...我被忽视了。”

Silence descended upon them. "You're just like me." None of the two knew who said it first, but Shinji was sure it was a side effect of his countless sync trainings with her.  
寂静笼罩着他们。“你和我一样。”两人都不知是谁先说出的这句话，但真嗣确信这是他与她无数次同步训练的副作用。

As for Asuka, she could feel a new sensation flowing through her body. Like spotting a hunter's lodge with firelight inside the deepest part of a dark forest, or catching the ray of piercing light from a lighthouse on a vast storm-raging ocean - it was a feeling of connection and mutual comprehension. Finally, she found the one, the person who might as well be a reflection of her, who also cared about her. They were two sides of the same coin, and once they found out about each other and join together, they became a whole.  
至于明日香，她能感觉到一种新的感觉在体内流淌。就像在黑暗森林深处发现一间有火光的猎人小屋，或是在狂风暴雨的广阔海洋上捕捉到灯塔的刺眼光芒——这是一种联系与相互理解的感觉。终于，她找到了那个人，那个可能是她镜像的人，也关心她的人。他们是同一枚硬币的两面，一旦发现彼此并联合起来，他们就成为了一个整体。

Asuka felt the emptiness in her heart was gradually filled with joy and surprise.  
明日香感到心中的空虚正逐渐被喜悦和惊喜填满。

In the end, he actually _could_ understand her like how she wanted.  
最终，他真的能像她所希望的那样理解她了。

"Idiot..." Asuka whispered. What now? Now she wanted him more than ever. He was the one in the world she had been seeking from the deepest part of her heart; now that she had him at her side, what should she do next?  
“笨蛋……”明日香低声说道。现在怎么办？现在她比以往任何时候都更想要他。他是她从内心深处一直在寻找的那个人；现在他就在她身边，她接下来该怎么办？

Which brought up another question that she dreaded his answer might not be what she wanted to hear.  
这又引出了另一个她害怕他的回答可能并非她所愿听的问题。

Would he ever want her the way she wanted him?  
他是否也会像她渴望他那样渴望她？

Nonetheless, Asuka knew if he ever dared to toy with her feelings, she would make him suffer in more than one way.  
尽管如此，明日香知道如果他胆敢玩弄她的感情，她会让他以多种方式受苦。

She didn't want to lose the...relationship they had right now, and moving forward too fast without knowing how far he wanted to go with her would very likely put an end to it. Still, Asuka Langley Soryu knew she had to take action from now on - before everything could become too late. "Well, actually I'd like to play some instruments someday later. With you."  
她不想失去他们现在的这种...关系，如果进展太快而不了解他想和她走多远，很可能会结束这一切。不过，惣流·明日香·兰格雷知道她必须从现在开始采取行动——以免为时已晚。“嗯，其实我想以后能和你一起玩些乐器。”

"Sure. I'm looking forward to it." Cracking a warm smile, Shinji let out a content exhale, satisfied that he made real progress bringing her out of her shell.  
“当然，我很期待。”真嗣露出温暖的笑容，满意地呼出一口气，因为他确实让她走出了自己的壳。

The redhead smiled herself to sleep as well, her nightmare was replaced by sweet dreams for the first time in a long while.  
红发女孩也带着微笑入睡，她的噩梦终于被久违的甜美梦境所取代。

"The Tenth Angel really did a number on Unit 02," looking at the damaged form of the crimson EVA Unit, Ritsuko frowned since she knew the repairs would be extensive.  
“第十使徒对二号机真是造成了不小的破坏，”看着那受损严重的赤红 EVA 二号机，律子皱起了眉头，因为她知道修复工作将会非常繁重。

"Well, better get started." Said one of the technicians beside her. "How do we deal with the lost organic tissues?"  
"好吧，最好开始吧。" 她旁边的一位技术员说道。"我们怎么处理丢失的有机组织？"

"I'd say we use the newly delivered protein blocks," Ritsuko pushed her glasses up her nose. "We don't know when's the next Angel attack, so we'd better hurry."  
"我想我们用新送来的蛋白质块，" 律子推了推她的眼镜。"我们不知道下一次使徒攻击是什么时候，所以最好快点。"

"So we're delaying the construction of Pribnow Box?" The technician raised an eyebrow.  
"那么我们推迟 Pribnow 盒子的建造吗？" 技术员挑了挑眉毛。"

"Still, it's an acceptable trade-off."  
“尽管如此，这仍是一个可接受的折中方案。”

The head of the logistic department sighed in resignation. "Alright, if you say so." The idea of the construction of Pribnow Box came from Dr. Akagi, so if now she wanted the materials for other uses, he didn't have anything to say in the matter.  
后勤部门负责人叹了口气，无奈地说：“好吧，既然你这么说。”普里博盒的建设构想源自赤木博士，既然她现在需要这些材料用于其他用途，他对此也无话可说。

After the technician left the Evangelion Chamber, Ritsuko Akagi returned her gaze back to the crimson Unit 02. Looking at the creation of her mother and herself, the head of Project Eva doubted.  
技术人员离开 EVA 格纳库后，赤木律子将目光重新投向那台深红色的零二号机。凝视着由她与母亲共同创造的杰作，这位 EVA 计划负责人心生疑虑。

_'Do I actually know what they are?'  
'我真的知道它们是什么吗？'_

*第二十章*: 第二十章：不确定性

免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

**Chapter 20: Uncertainty 第二十章：不确定性**

The rising sun had just begun to light up the pre-dawn skies when Shinji woke. The alarm was not loud, but Shinji was used to wake in the first two seconds of its sound. He reached to deactivate it. A glance at the alarm told him it was 6:45 in the morning.  
当真嗣醒来时，初升的太阳刚刚开始照亮黎明前的天空。闹钟的声音并不大，但真嗣习惯在它响起的前两秒醒来。他伸手去关闭闹钟。瞥了一眼闹钟，告诉他现在是早上 6 点 45 分。

Looking down from his position, he could see strands of red hair that threatened to cover his face. The owner of them was facing the other side, her legs intertwined with his.  
从他的位置向下看，他能看到几缕红发，这些发丝似乎要遮住他的脸。头发的主人正背对着他，双腿与他的交缠在一起。

Smiling to himself a little, Shinji slowly disentangled himself from the redhead and rose from his futon. For the past two weeks, they'd fell asleep like this several times as long as they made sure Misato was adequately underwater. Asuka, well, _this_ Asuka was closer to him than ever, but she wasn't willing to take the last step – being clear with their relationship. And Shinji was clear that he needed to find a way to convince her that he indeed loved her more than anything else in the world.  
微微一笑，真嗣缓缓地从红发少女身边抽身，起身离开他的被褥。过去两周里，只要确保美里充分沉浸在水下，他们便多次这样入睡。眼前的明日香，比以往任何时候都更亲近他，但她不愿迈出最后一步——明确他们的关系。真嗣清楚，他需要找到方法，让她相信他确实深爱着她，胜过世间一切。

It could wait, though. And there was something else that had Shinji worry more.  
不过，这可以等一等。还有其他事情更让真嗣担忧。

Today they were supposed to participate in the simulation test where Ireul was expected to attack. That was not his primary concern, though. The fact that the date of the test was delayed by one week was what introduced anxiety. In all of his former cycles, this particular test had always taken place on the same date, at least he remembered so.  
今天他们本应参加模拟测试，预计 Ireul 会发起攻击。但这并不是他主要担心的问题。测试日期被推迟一周的事实才真正引起了他的焦虑。在他所有的前世循环中，这个特定的测试总是在同一个日期进行，至少他记得是这样。

Learning from his mistakes with the Seventh and the Eighth Angel, Shinji had to treat this seemingly insignificant discrepancy seriously.  
从第七和第八使徒的错误中吸取教训，真嗣必须认真对待这个看似微不足道的差异。

"G'd 'orning…" So came the sleepy greetings from his favorite redhead. "Morning, Asuka," Shinji joyed a reply. "I'm going to make breakfast, and you should get up as well before Misato could notice anything."  
"早安……" 他最爱的红发女孩带着睡意问候道。"早，明日香，" 真嗣愉快地回应，"我要去做早餐了，你也该起床了，别让美里注意到什么。"

"Right…" Asuka yawned and stretched her limbs, getting up from the futon as well. "Thanks for the warmth last night," she grinned and gave him a peck on the cheeks, something that had become her habit since a few days ago. "And don't forget that you're going to the mall with me and Hikari today after the stupid test." She only asked Hikari to go as her wingman, though. The main target was Shinji, and she would also have someone to carry her bags. Two birds with one stone, a brilliant plan worthy for the great Asuka.  
"好吧……" 明日香打了个哈欠，伸了伸懒腰，也从被褥上起身。"谢谢你昨晚的温暖，"她笑着在他脸颊上轻吻了一下，这是她几天前养成的习惯。"别忘了，今天考完那无聊的试后，你要和我还有美里一起去商场。" 她之所以叫美里一起去，只是为了找个伴儿。主要目标是真嗣，而且还有人帮她拎包。一箭双雕，这可是伟大的明日香才能想出的绝妙计划。

"Sure, I guess I'll just have to carry the loot, then."  
"好吧，看来我只能负责搬运战利品了。"

"Baka, you don't get to complain!" Said Asuka in mock anger before carefully sliding the bedroom door open and swiftly left the room.  
"笨蛋，你可没资格抱怨！" 明日香假装生气地说道，然后小心翼翼地拉开卧室门，迅速离开了房间。

Shinji let out a sigh mixed with relief and anxiousness. Another big event coming up was the anniversary of his mother's death. In fact, it was just tomorrow. He could only hope things would turn into a better direction this time. Today was going to be a long day.  
真嗣叹了口气，混合着释然与焦虑。又一个大事件即将到来，是他母亲的忌日。实际上，就在明天。他只能希望这次事情能朝着更好的方向发展。今天将会是漫长的一天。

"Oh are you fucking serious?!" Asuka clenched onto her towel, keeping it tightly wrapped around her body. "Triple decontamination still isn't enough?!"  
"哦，你他妈是认真的吗？！" 明日香紧抓着她的毛巾，紧紧裹住身体，"三次净化还不够吗？！"

"Relax a little, Asuka," Dr. Akagi's professional voice came to her from the speakers. "But we can never be too careful. I need to make sure the simulation tests are not affected by any foreign bodies. And I need a purer sample as well."  
"放松一点，明日香，" 从扬声器中传来赤城博士专业的声音。"但我们绝不能掉以轻心。我需要确保模拟测试不受任何外来物的影响。而且我也需要一个更纯净的样本。"

"Purer sample of what?" Asuka exclaimed in exasperation. "Our sweat?!"  
"更纯净的样本？" 明日香恼怒地喊道。"我们的汗水吗？！"

"A purer sample of your synchrograph directly from your body without the interference of plugsuits," Ritsuko explained. "That's an order. Comply."  
"是从你身体直接获取的同步图谱样本，不受插入栓服的干扰，" 律子解释道。"这是命令。服从。"

"But I don't wanna." Asuka kept whining.  
“但我不想嘛。”明日香继续抱怨道。

"Too bad." Ritsuko's voice was turning impatient. "Just go through decontamination one more time, and you'll be good."  
“那也没办法。”律子的声音开始显得不耐烦，“再通过一次去污程序，你就没事了。”

"Fine!" Asuka stomped her feet onto the plastic floor and threw the towel aside. She had a feeling that even if she was put through the carwash machine, her skin wouldn't feel this cleansing.  
“好吧！”明日香跺了跺脚下的塑料地板，把毛巾扔到一边。她有种感觉，即使被放进洗车机里，她的皮肤也不会觉得这么干净。

She stepped through the door that was the exit of the final decontamination area, entering another large white chamber. After a moment, with a hissing sound, the farthest door opened as well, and Rei Ayanami walked through. Asuka couldn't help but notice how pale and clean her skin was to the extent it almost made her jealous.  
她穿过最后一道去污区的出口门，进入另一个宽敞的白色房间。片刻后，随着一阵嘶嘶声，最远处的门也打开了，绫波零走了进来。明日香忍不住注意到她的皮肤是多么苍白和干净，几乎让她感到嫉妒。

"Hey, Wondergirl." She called out. "Are you-" Her words began to morph into a scream as the door to the stall closest to hers opened, and in came the nude form of Shinji Ikari. "What the hell is he-" She trailed off as another idea crept into her mind. This would be a perfect opportunity to 'legitimately' show off her body to Shinji, who had been exhibiting an uncanny amount of respect to her modesty.  
"嘿，奇迹女孩。" 她喊道。"你——" 她的话音开始转变成尖叫，因为离她最近的隔间门打开了，进来的正是赤裸的碇真嗣。"他到底在搞什么——" 她话没说完，另一个念头悄然浮现。这正是个绝佳的机会，可以"名正言顺"地向一直对她保持异常尊重的碇真嗣展示自己的身材。

"Sorry Asuka, but this is the only corridor that leads to the Pribnow Box. You just have to deal with it. We'll turn the camera off. As for you three you're just going to go by the honor code."  
“抱歉，明日香，但这是通往普里博箱的唯一走廊。你只能忍耐一下。我们会把摄像头关掉。至于你们三个，就靠荣誉准则行事吧。”

"Whatever!" Asuka pouted before pointing the finger at her right side. "Wondergirl, you go last, I go first." It was _her_ turn to shine, not wondergirl's. She would severely regret it if in the end Shinji was more attracted to the First Child.  
"随你怎么说！" 明日香噘着嘴，指向自己右侧。"绫波，你最后上，我先来。" 这次该轮到她大放异彩了，而不是绫波。如果最终真嗣更倾心于第一适格者，她会后悔莫及的。

Once the glass doors opened, the three began making their way out of the stalls and through the long white chamber based on the sequence Asuka had suggested. Even though she didn't bother to threaten him not to peek at her nude form, Shinji still tried his best to avoid any unintentional glances as he kept staring at the ceiling.  
玻璃门一打开，三人便按照明日香建议的顺序，开始从隔间里出来，穿过长长的白色房间。尽管她没有威胁他不许偷看她的裸体，但真嗣还是尽力避免任何无意的目光，一直盯着天花板。

Asuka could see his awkward posture through the dim reflection on the wall of the chamber. The fact that he sometimes actually failed to avoid his eyes from looking down flattered her a little. _'After all, you're just a boy,'_ she thought with satisfaction and amusement. Nonetheless, she still felt shameful and humiliated by basically giving free looks of her body to a boy. But as long as he was Shinji, someone she liked and trusted, she was okay with that.  
明日香透过室内墙壁上昏暗的倒影，察觉到他那笨拙的姿态。他偶尔未能避开视线，不经意地向下看，这让她心中掠过一丝得意。“说到底，你也只是个男孩。”她带着满意与戏谑的心情想道。尽管如此，她仍因近乎无偿地向一个男孩展示自己的身体而感到羞耻与屈辱。但只要对方是真嗣，那个她喜欢并信任的人，她便觉得无妨。

Not to mention she finally couldn't suppress her own curiosity and stole a few glances back. To her surprise, although Shinji was definitely not muscular, he was undoubtedly athletic and cute in his own way.  
更别提她最终还是按捺不住自己的好奇心，偷偷回头看了几眼。令她惊讶的是，尽管真嗣绝对算不上肌肉发达，但他无疑有着运动员般的体魄，而且自有一种可爱。

In the lab, Ritsuko watched over the thermal monitors of each Entry Plug as their respective pilots boarded them. All readings seemed to be ordinary. No foreign bodies were detected, and all systems appeared to be in place. The test was not so dissimilar to the VR training that the pilots were required to take as part of the Evangelion training program. Just this time they were inside submerged simulated EVA bodies, not software.  
在实验室里，律子监视着每个插入栓的热量监控器，随着各自的驾驶员进入其中。所有读数似乎都很正常。没有检测到异物，所有系统似乎都已就位。这次测试与驾驶员在 EVA 训练计划中必须进行的 VR 训练并无太大差别。只是这次他们是在浸水的模拟 EVA 机体内部，而非软件中。

"Alright guys, this is only a simulation test." Dr. Akagi spoke, her voice coming out from the speakers inside the cockpits. "All you need to do is try to move the simulated bodies with your mind, as if it's just an extension of your body."  
“好了，各位，这只是一个模拟测试。” 赤木博士的声音从驾驶舱内的扬声器中传出，“你们只需要尝试用意念移动模拟机体，就像它是你身体的延伸一样。”

"I feel...my arm is all tingly." Shinji chimed in as he lifted his left arm, wiggling his fingers as he did so.  
"我感觉...我的手臂麻麻的。" 真嗣插话道，同时举起他的左臂，扭动着手指。

"Yeah, same." Asuka added. "My right leg is all I can feel clearly. Everything else is fuzzy."  
"嗯，我也是。" 明日香补充道。"我的右腿是我唯一能清晰感觉到的部位。其他地方都模模糊糊的。"

"That's normal. In fact, it means the system is working." Risuko's voice echoed through their cockpits. "Rei, imagine moving your right arm."  
"这是正常的。实际上，这意味着系统正在工作。" 律子的声音通过他们的驾驶舱回响。"绫波，想象移动你的右臂。"

"Yes, ma'am." Rei pulled the controls inside her entry plug. The right hand of the simulated body moved at the same time she thought of moving it.  
“是的，女士。”丽在插入栓内拉动控制杆。模拟身体的右手在她想到移动的同时动了起来。

Inside of the lab, Ritsuko grinned in excitement. This test was going phenomenally. The readings they were getting from this were terrific. They could see the pilot's bodies and brainwave activities were perfectly synchronized with that of their simulation bodies.  
实验室内部，律子兴奋地咧嘴笑着。这次测试进行得非常出色。他们从这次测试中获得的读数非常棒。可以看到驾驶员的身体和脑波活动与他们的模拟身体完全同步。

Shinji waited for them to be ejected into the lake that never came.  
真嗣等待着他们被弹射进从未到来的湖中。

"The test is concluded, good job you three," Dr. Akagi's slightly cheerful voice sent a chilling shiver ran down Shinji's spine. He hated the feeling of losing control, and this time completely. Where else could the Angel attack? He could only find solace in the fact that he didn't bother telling his father about the specifics of the eleventh Angel.  
“测试结束了，你们三个做得很好，”赤木博士略带欢快的声音让真嗣背脊一阵发凉。他讨厌失去控制的感觉，而这次是彻底的。使徒还会从哪里发起攻击？他只能安慰自己，没有向父亲透露第十一使徒的具体情况。

Commander Ikari sat completely stationary at his desk in the middle of the darkened room. Around him were black, monolithic holograms with the SEELE insignia printed on them, as well as a number for each monolith ranging from one to twelve.  
碇司令坐在昏暗房间中央的办公桌前，一动不动。他周围环绕着黑色、巨大的全息影像，上面印有 Seele 的标志，每个巨石上还标有一个从一到十二的数字。

"What's NERV's current progress on the development of the Dummy Plug system?" SEELE 01, chairman Keel spoke up first as usual, his voice a bit raspy and hoarse.  
"NERV 目前在 Dummy Plug 系统的开发上进展如何？" SEELE 01 的主席基尔一如既往地率先发言，他的声音有些沙哑。

"The simulation test today yielded wonderful results and valuable data. Dr. Akagi thinks we can get the first prototype ready very quickly." Gendo Ikari replied, keeping his hands clasped together over his mouth. "Expect the first of the series to be transported to NERV Germany branch in two weeks at most."  
"今天的模拟测试取得了极佳的结果和宝贵的数据。赤木博士认为我们很快就能准备好第一个原型。" 碇源堂回答道，双手合十遮住嘴巴。"预计第一批系列产品将在两周内运送到 NERV 德国分部。"

"Still, it's way behind schedule, and it could bring unnecessary risks to the scenario." SEELE 01 kept his menacing tone but didn't attempt to make himself sound overly upset. "We can't rely solely on those children. Too much can go wrong."  
"尽管如此，进度仍然严重滞后，这可能会给计划带来不必要的风险。" SEELE 01 保持着威胁性的语气，但没有表现出过于不满。"我们不能完全依赖那些孩子。太多事情可能出错。"

Gendo almost failed to suppress a chuckle if not for his skilled composure-controlling abilities. Nevertheless, he had to find a way to explain the delay in constructing the Dummy Plug System. "We would have had it ready and delivered if you let us use Rei's thought patterns instead of…your little pet's."  
如果不是凭借高超的自控力，碇源堂几乎要忍不住笑出声来。然而，他必须找到解释 Dummy Plug 系统延迟建造的理由。“如果我们能使用绫波的思维模式而不是……您的小宠物的，我们本可以按时完成并交付的。”

"Watch your tongue, Ikari." SEELE 02 snapped. Even though the microphones were programmed to make sure the speaker's actual voice was distorted, from his accent Gendo had a good guess that he was the ambassador of Russia. "For the Human Instrumentality Project to be successfully fulfilled, the Committee has determined it best for the Mass-Produced EVAs to use Dummy Plugs based on our own specimen."  
"注意你的言辞，碇。" SEELE 02 厉声道。尽管麦克风被设定为确保发言者的真实声音被扭曲，但从他的口音中，碇源堂大致猜到他是俄罗斯的大使。"为了使人类补完计划成功实现，委员会认为最好让量产型 EVA 使用基于我们自己样本的傀儡系统。"

"True, but I wasn't questioning your judgment." Gendo's voice kept its stony and cold impression. "If you deem your specimen is better suited, then so be it. However, it didn't change the fact that it was the reason for delay."  
"确实，但我并非质疑您的判断。" 碇源堂的声音保持着冷硬不变的印象。"如果您认为您的样本更合适，那就这样吧。然而，这并未改变它导致延误的事实。"

"Irrelevant." SEELE 03 started up. "We expect it to be ready by our next meeting. If you can't meet up with our schedule, we can find someone else who will."  
"无关紧要。" SEELE 03 接话道。"我们预计在下一次会议前准备好。如果你无法跟上我们的进度，我们可以找其他人来完成。"

Even though Gendo knew the threat was pointless, he still couldn't help but feel anger rise from inside his chest. It wasn't about anything else – it was about Yui.  
尽管源堂知道这种威胁毫无意义，但他还是忍不住感到胸中怒火升腾。这无关其他——这是关于唯。

Shinji had told him about the uselessness of Dummy Plug systems. It would only work in Unit 01 when two conditions were met - the presence of Shinji and imminent danger. Gendo accepted his statement half-believingly, though it didn't change the fact that SEELE still demanded the completion of Dummy Plugs. He had no way to convince those old men.  
真嗣曾告诉他，Dummy Plug 系统的无用性。只有在满足两个条件时，它才能在初号机中工作——真嗣的存在和迫在眉睫的危险。源堂半信半疑地接受了他的说法，尽管这并未改变 SEELE 仍要求完成 Dummy Plugs 的事实。他无法说服那些老者。

"Keep the Lance of Longinus safe in the basement. It's necessary to commence the ritual." SEELE 01 interjected. "You will report any anomalies to us as soon as possible. Understood?"  
“将朗基努斯之枪安全地保管在地下室。启动仪式是必要的。”SEELE 01 插话道，“一旦发现任何异常，立即向我们报告。明白吗？”

"Of course." Gendo replied. "What's the current progress of the construction of Unit 03 and Unit 04?"  
"当然。" 碇源堂回答道，"零号机和三号机的建造进度如何？"

"The American branch wants to hold onto their Units for a little longer." SEELE 05 spoke up.  
"美国分部想多保留他们的 EVA 一段时间。" SEELE 05 发言道。"

"Sure, keep them there until all the Angels are defeated," Gendo scoffed.  
"可以，让他们留在那里，直到所有使徒被消灭为止，" 碇源堂嗤之以鼻。"

"If you need additional Units, we can require the American branch to transfer them to Japan as soon as they're done with their tests." SEELE 01's voice had a hint of curiosity in it. "Though why do you want more when you already have three perfectly working EVAs?"  
"如果你需要更多单位，我们可以要求美国分部在测试完成后立即将它们转移到日本。" SEELE 01 的声音中带着一丝好奇。"不过，既然你已经有三台运作良好的 EVA，为什么还要更多呢？"

"Better safe than sorry, we almost failed before." Commander Ikari narrowed his eyes slightly. "Besides, what's the point of keeping them in the US where no Angel would attack, anyway?"  
"有备无患，我们之前差点就失败了。" 碇司令微微眯起眼睛。"再说，把它们留在美国，那里又不会有使徒攻击，有什么意义呢？"

"Mind your own business, Ikari."  
"管好你自己的事，碇。"

With that, the monolithic holograms faded into darkness. After a moment of sitting alone in the shadows, the lights around Commander Ikari were turned on, revealing the grey-haired elder standing beside him, his hands clasped behind his back. "The old men are certainly getting impatient."  
话音刚落，巨大的全息影像便逐渐隐入黑暗。片刻后，独自坐在阴影中的碇司令周围灯光亮起，一位灰白头发的长者双手背在身后站在他身旁。“那些老家伙确实越来越不耐烦了。”

"Regardless, we follow our own path." Gendo stood up from his chair. "We don't need their sub-standard MP EVAs in our own scenario, anyways." Speaking, he held his head up, looking at the ceiling that was painted with a picture of the tree of life. He needed Unit 01, which meant he needed Shinji as well. He could only hope his son was helping him genuinely.  
“无论如何，我们走自己的路。”碇源堂从椅子上站起身来。“反正我们也不需要他们那些劣质的量产型 EVA。”说着，他抬起头，望着天花板上绘有的生命之树图案。他需要初号机，这意味着他也需要真嗣。他只能希望儿子是真心在帮助他。

"Guys, I have to go to the bathroom! Could you please wait for me here? I'll be back in a moment!" Said Shinji with a pained expression as he massaged his stomach, a half-empty bottle of mustard milk tea he dared to try was thrown aside.  
“伙计们，我得去趟洗手间！你们能在这里等我一下吗？我马上就回来！”真嗣痛苦地揉着肚子说道，他敢尝试的那瓶半空的芥末奶茶被扔到了一旁。

"Baka, you're hopeless," Asuka rubbed her temple in exasperation, even though she was the one who goaded him into drinking the cursed liquid. "Just be quick! We still have a lot ahead of us."  
"笨蛋，你真是没救了，" 明日香揉着太阳穴，尽管是她怂恿他喝下那诅咒的液体。"快点吧！我们还有很多事要做。"

"Yes ma'am," putting down the bags, Shinji rushed in the direction of the mall's bathroom.  
"是的，女士，" 放下袋子，真嗣急忙朝商场的洗手间方向跑去。

Asuka huffed after Shinji disappeared from her peripheral vision. She raised her arm, looking at the wristband she had just bought. It had a color scheme similar to Unit 01's – green and purple. Though while Unit 01 was mainly purple with green stripes and chunks, the wristband was based more on green color with violet dots. The price of it wasn't really meeting Asuka's standard of expectance, but she could give it a pass considering no one else really fancied the color, and the supply and demand principle was something Asuka had no way to manipulate.  
碇真嗣从她的视线边缘消失后，明日香哼了一声。她抬起手臂，看着刚刚买的手环。它的配色与初号机相似——绿色和紫色。虽然初号机主要是紫色，带有绿色条纹和色块，但手环则以绿色为主，点缀着紫色的圆点。这个价格并没有达到明日香的标准预期，但考虑到没有人真正喜欢这种颜色，而且供需原则是明日香无法操纵的，她可以勉强接受。

Moreover, she bought the wristband in hopes of Shinji noticing her so he would pay more attention to her, despite the fact that he was already basically spending two-thirds of his waking time and all of his sleeping time with her.  
此外，她买这个手环是希望真嗣能注意到她，从而更加关注她，尽管事实上他几乎已经把三分之二的清醒时间和全部的睡眠时间都花在她身上了。

But Asuka Langley Soryu wanted him to be _completely_ hers and no one else's. She didn't do things halfway.  
但惣流·明日香·兰格雷希望他完全属于她，而不是任何其他人。她做事从不半途而废。

"Whatcha thinkin', Asuka?" Hikari's abrupt question caught her attention, snapping her out of her train of thoughts.  
"在想什么呢，明日香？" 光突然的提问吸引了她的注意，将她从思绪中拉回。

"Nothing," Asuka turned to face the Class Rep. "Just certain stuff that recently happened, that's all."  
"没什么，" 明日香转向面对班长。"只是最近发生的一些事情，就这样。"

"Seriously, though. Why purple and green?" Hikari pointed at her wristband with a slightly disapproving frown. "They have blue ones, pink ones, red ones. And even the yellow and white mix looks better than yours! There's a reason that people don't buy it." Truthfully, the purple and green color mix on her wristband was not very aesthetic.  
"说真的，为什么选紫色和绿色？" 光指着她的腕带，微微皱眉表示不赞同。"有蓝色的，粉色的，红色的。甚至黄色和白色的混搭都比你的好看！人们不买它是有原因的。" 确实，她腕带上紫色和绿色的搭配并不怎么美观。

"It's a...personal preference," Asuka executed her technically true maneuver.  
"这是...个人喜好，" 明日香巧妙地使用了她那技术上真实的策略。

"Oh, okay." The brunette seemed like she had something on her mind, judging by her tone. "Hey, um… Asuka?"  
"哦，好吧。" 这位棕发女孩听起来心事重重，从她的语气可以判断。"嘿，嗯……明日香？"

The said girl sighed internally. Knowing Hikari, from her overly nervous yet promising tone, Asuka knew she was going to ask something from her. "Yeah?"  
被提到的女孩内心叹了口气。从光过于紧张却又充满希望的语气中，明日香知道她要向自己提出什么请求。"嗯？"

"May I ask a favor of you?" Hikari whispered, her body twitching in nervousness.  
"我可以请你帮个忙吗？" 光小声说道，她的身体因紧张而微微颤抖。

Asuka didn't expect anything less. Sighing, she said, "Sure, go ahead."  
明日香对此并不感到意外。她叹了口气，说道：“当然，去吧。”

Hikari's looked around her as if scanning the area for enemies before bringing her lips right next to Asuka's ear. "My older sister, Kodama Horaki, one of her friends is having a huge crush on you. She asked me to ask you if you could go on a date with him." She whispered, having to hide her schoolgirl giggle.  
光环顾四周，仿佛在扫描是否有敌人，然后将嘴唇贴近明日香的耳朵。“我姐姐，堀越小珠，她的一个朋友对你非常着迷。她让我问问你，能不能和他约会。”她低声说道，努力掩饰自己的少女窃笑。

"What?!" The redhead jumped back, taken aback by the boldness of the request, especially not from Hikari. "A date?!"  
“什么？！”红发女孩惊得跳开，对这大胆的请求感到意外，尤其是来自光。“约会？！”

Making a begging face, Hikari folded her hands together and pleaded. "Oh please, Asuka? You're not dating anyone, right? Just one date? He's a great guy, really!"  
做出一副乞求的表情，光双手合十恳求道：“哦，求你了，明日香？你又没在和谁约会，对吧？就一次约会嘛？他是个好人，真的！”

"There's no way." Asuka's reply was plain and simple, and her tone made it clear that negotiation was out of the question.  
“绝不可能。”明日香的回答直截了当，语气表明谈判毫无余地。

"Oh, c'mon! He's a handsome and gentle upper-class student. You won't regret it!"  
"哦，拜托！他是个英俊又温柔的优等生。你不会后悔的！"

"No." She added more firmness into her voice. If she wanted Shinji all by herself, it was only fair for her to completely be Shinji's. Even though for some unspoken reason she doubted Shinji wouldn't leave her even if she goes on the date, the idea just didn't feel right, _virtuous_ to her.  
"不行。" 她的语气更加坚定。如果她想独自拥有真嗣，那么她就应该完全属于真嗣。尽管出于某种未言明的原因，她怀疑即使她去约会，真嗣也不会离开她，但这个想法就是让她觉得不对劲，对她来说不正直。

"You don't have to like him, just one date! Do me a favor, please!"  
"你不必喜欢他，就一次约会！帮帮我，好吗？"

"No is a no, Hikari. I'm sorry, but there's just no way. I'm not gonna go on a date with some random guy whom I've never met before, just because you asked!" Although she deemed Hikari her friend, impatience and irritation still radiated from her voice.  
“不行就是不行，光。抱歉，但真的没戏。我不会因为你一句话就去和一个素未谋面的陌生人约会！”尽管她把光视为朋友，但声音中仍透出不耐与烦躁。

Instead of the sulky and disappointed tone she had expected from Hikari, the brunette grinned smugly. "Oh, I know what this is about." Asuka didn't like the full-swing teasing tone she was using. "You have a crush on Shinji, don't you?" Hikari threw a look in the direction where Shinji left.  
"出乎意料的是，光并没有用她预想中的那种闷闷不乐和失望的语气，而是得意地笑了。“哦，我知道这是怎么回事了。”明日香不喜欢她这种全然挑逗的语调。“你对真嗣有意思，对吧？”光朝着真嗣离开的方向瞥了一眼。”

Out of sheer reflex, Asuka made a near horrified expression as she jumped forward and placed one of her hands over Hikari's mouth. "No!" She exclaimed in a hushed tone. "What makes you think that?!"  
"出于纯粹的反射性动作，明日香做出近乎惊恐的表情，向前一跃，用手捂住了光的嘴。“不！”她压低声音惊呼，“你怎么会这么想？！””

"C'mon, it's so obvious," Hikari winked at her. "The whole class knows. Are you even aware that on average, for every five minutes you would steal a glance at him?"  
"拜托，这么明显," 光对她眨了眨眼。"全班都知道。你有没有意识到，平均每五分钟你就会偷看他一眼？"

"Are you serious?" Asuka thought she had been subtle about her feelings for Shinji, especially considering that not a long while ago, she was actively keeping a distance from him.  
"你是认真的吗？" 明日香以为她对真嗣的感情已经很隐晦了，尤其是考虑到不久前，她还刻意与他保持距离。

"Yeah," Hikari nodded. Grinning, she added, "So, I understand if you don't want to go out with my sister's friend."  
"是啊," 光点头道。她笑着补充说，"所以，我理解如果你不想和我姐姐的朋友出去。"

"Of course not," Asuka held her head up. "Actually, you know what. If everyone knows, I think I'll just straight ask Shinji out on a date." _'A proper one,'_ her mind added.  
"“当然不是，”明日香昂起头，“其实，你知道吗。如果大家都知道了，我想我会直接约真嗣出去约会。”‘正式的那种，’她的心里补充道。”

"Ohhhh, I feel so happy for you, Asuka!" Hikari giggled like a schoolgirl she was.  
“哦，我真为你感到高兴，明日香！” 光就像个女学生一样咯咯笑着。

_Asuka laid on her back on the couch while a silly soap show played on the television. She wasn't really paying much attention to the content, though, since her mind was occupied by other things right now.  
明日香仰躺在沙发上，电视里播放着一部傻乎乎的肥皂剧。她其实并没有太关注剧情，因为此刻她的心思被其他事情占据着。_

_She lifted herself up and looked at the hallway leading to the front door with an unreadable expression. She had convinced herself to ask Shinji out on a date, and in a way, it still worried her. Even though all the stuff they had been secretly doing was much more intimate, they were still ambiguous. But a date? It could be considered as an official announcement that they were now a couple, boyfriend and girlfriend. Of course blind dates wouldn't lead to such a conclusion, but given the intimate interactions between her and Shinji, it was safe to say this would seal their deal.  
她坐起身来，目光投向通往大门的走廊，脸上带着难以解读的表情。她已经说服自己邀请真嗣出去约会，尽管如此，这件事仍让她感到不安。尽管他们之间那些秘密进行的亲密行为远比约会更为私密，但关系依旧暧昧不清。然而，一次约会？这几乎可以被视为他们正式成为情侣的宣告，男朋友和女朋友。当然，相亲并不会导致这样的结论，但考虑到她和真嗣之间的亲密互动，可以说这次约会将会是他们关系的定音之锤。_

_Shinji hadn't come home yet, and Asuka could feel her courage of asking him out on a date was gradually slipping away with each passing moment.  
真嗣还没回家，而明日香感觉到自己约他出去的勇气正随着每一分每一秒逐渐消逝。_

_Her musings were interrupted by the hissing sound of the door sliding open and an announcement of "I'm home!" from Shinji. As he stepped through the living room, Asuka mustered up all of her willpower. It's now or never.  
她的思绪被门滑开时的嘶嘶声打断，真嗣喊着“我回来了！”走进客厅。当他穿过起居室时，明日香鼓起所有的意志力。机不可失，时不再来。_

_"Shinji, are you available tomorrow?" She blurted out, her eyes still focused on the TV screen rather than its content.  
“真嗣，你明天有空吗？”她脱口而出，眼睛依旧盯着电视屏幕，而非其内容。_

_"Actually I'm occupied tomorrow, why ask?" Shinji replied as he put down his schoolbag on the couch beside her.  
"其实我明天有事，干嘛问这个？" 真嗣边回答边把书包放在她旁边的沙发上。_

_"What?!" Asuka exclaimed. "What's on your schedule tomorrow?"  
"什么？！" 明日香惊呼。"你明天有什么安排？"_

_"The anniversary of my mother's death," Shinji answered with a slightly strained voice. "I have to visit her grave tomorrow."  
“我母亲的忌日，”真嗣回答时声音略显紧张。“明天我得去扫墓。”_

_"Oh." The redhead fell silent. So the was the result of her unprecedented courage of actively asking someone else out on a date. Extreme disappointment and irritation weren't enough to describe her feelings. But she couldn't blame him, though. Shinji didn't decide the date of her mother's decease, did he?  
“哦。”红发女孩沉默了。原来这就是她前所未有的勇气主动约人出去的结果。极度的失望和恼怒都不足以形容她的心情。但她不能怪他，不是吗？真嗣并没有决定他母亲去世的日期，对吧？_

_Speaking of which… 说到这个……_

_"Well, be strong, Shinji." Asuka stood up and placed a hand on his shoulder, keeping her reassuring smile. "Just remember that I understand you."  
"嗯，坚强点，真嗣。" 明日香站起身，把手放在他的肩膀上，保持着安慰的微笑。"记住，我理解你。"_

_"Thanks, Asuka." Shinji replied with a warm smile that almost melted her heart. "Do you have any plans for tomorrow? I hope you won't get too bored alone at home."  
"谢谢你，明日香。" 真嗣回以一个温暖的微笑，几乎融化了她的心。"你明天有什么计划吗？希望你不会在家太无聊。"_

_"I'll be fine. Worst case scenario, I'll just go to Hikari's and play video games with her." Asuka reassured him.  
"我会没事的。最坏的情况，我就去光那里和她一起玩游戏。" 明日香安慰他道。_

_"Really, if you don't want to me go I can stay home and spend the time with you," Shinji said.  
"真的，如果你不想我去的话，我可以留在家里陪你，" 真嗣说。_

_"C'mon, Shinji, it's the anniversary of your mother's death! You should really go," Asuka insisted, this time with more firmness in her voice. On second thought, this could be a final test of her endurability on being alone. "Trust me, I'll be fine."  
"快点，真嗣，今天是你母亲的忌日！你真的应该去，" 明日香坚持道，这次她的语气更加坚定。转念一想，这可能是对她独自忍受能力的最终考验。"相信我，我会没事的。"_

_"Alright, if you say so..." Shinji conceded.  
"好吧，既然你这么说..." 真嗣让步了。"_

And now Asuka felt like a huge idiot for saying she would be okay because now she was bored shitless. After Shinji had gone to visit his mother's grave, Misato quickly left the apartment to her friend's wedding as well, leaving her alone in the apartment. She didn't have plans to go to Hikari's place, she just said it to let Shinji rest assured. And the consequences were now coming crashing down on her.  
现在明日香觉得自己像个超级大傻瓜，因为她说过自己会没事的，结果现在无聊透顶。真嗣去拜访他母亲的墓地后，美里也很快离开了公寓去参加朋友的婚礼，留下她一个人在公寓里。她并没有计划去光那里，只是那么说让真嗣放心。而现在，后果正向她袭来。

She tried to watch TV, but all the stuff on it was boring soap shows, and nothing interested her. Playing the gaming console she tried later, but without Shinji playing it with her, it would be pointless since almost all the fun from it came from Shinji.  
她试图看电视，但上面全是乏味的肥皂剧，没有一样能引起她的兴趣。后来她尝试玩电子游戏机，但没有真嗣陪她玩，这毫无意义，因为几乎所有的乐趣都来自真嗣。

Calling Hikari was also out of the question since she had told her she would ask Shinji out on a date today, and taking that back now would make her look pathetic.  
给光打电话也不可能，因为她已经告诉光她今天要约真嗣出去，现在反悔会让她显得很可怜。

She thought she could be alone by herself, she thought being alone wouldn't bother her. But that seemed not to be the case anymore, not after she learned that company could be good, as long as it was someone she liked.  
她曾以为自己可以独自一人，以为孤独不会困扰她。但似乎情况已不再如此，自从她了解到陪伴可以是美好的，只要那是她喜欢的人。

"I've had enough," Asuka muttered to herself as she jumped up from the couch. After changing into a set of comfortable clothes, Asuka walked to the apartment door and took a deep breath before turning the doorknob and stepped outside.  
“我受够了，”明日香喃喃自语，从沙发上跳了起来。换上一套舒适的衣物后，明日香走到公寓门前，深吸一口气，转动门把手，踏出了门外。

She could still go to that place, and she was sure he wouldn't mind.  
她仍可以去那个地方，她确信他不会介意。

*第 21 章*: 第二十一章：联系

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion. One Kaji/Misato scene I adopted from my other fic Sincerely Yours cuz I'm lazy :/  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。一段改编自我的另一篇作品《真诚的你的》里的加持/美里场景，因为我懒 :/

**Chapter 21: Connection 第二十一章：连接**

Misato rolled her head back as she downed her fourth shot of sake since the reception started. She and her college friends – namely, Ritsuko and Kaji sat around a small table while other guests of the wedding ceremony chatted and laughed among themselves.  
自从招待会开始，美里仰头喝下了她的第四杯清酒。她和她的大学朋友们——特别是律子和加持——围坐在一张小桌子旁，而婚礼的其他宾客则在周围聊天欢笑。

"Life doesn't get any better than this! YYEEAAAHH!" Misato exclaimed as she slammed the empty bottle onto the table. "More!"  
"生活还能更美好吗！YYEEAAAHH！" 美里将空瓶猛地拍在桌上，"再来！"

"Katsuragi, do you even know what is self-control?" Kaji gazed at his ex-lover disapprovingly. Deepening his frown as he saw Misato smirked and shook her head, he continued. "You can't act as if we are still in college."  
"葛城，你到底懂不懂什么叫自制力？" 加持不满地看着他的前女友。看到美里咧嘴一笑并摇头，他的眉头皱得更深了，"你不能表现得好像我们还在大学里一样。"

"What gives," Misato huffed, filling up her glass bottle once again. "Don't be such a spoiled sport. I can handle my liquor. We've done much worse in college, and in my home as well." She threw a playful look at Kaji, and her cheeks were starting to turn pink.  
"怎么了，" 美里哼了一声，再次将她的玻璃瓶倒满。"别这么扫兴。我酒量好得很。大学时我们干过更出格的事，在我家也是。" 她俏皮地瞥了加持一眼，双颊开始泛红。

"From the looks of it, you're only a few drinks away from throwing up…" Ritsuko sighed. Binge drinking was a horrible habit, and as a doctor, she knew that better than anyone, especially the drunk Major of NERV sitting in front of her.  
「看样子，你再喝几杯就要吐了……」律子叹了口气。酗酒是个糟糕的习惯，作为医生，她比任何人都清楚这一点，尤其是眼前这位烂醉如泥的 NERV 本部长大。

"Well… I'm gonna go powder my nose…" Came a drunken voice as Misato staggered to her feet. "I wanna good for…for the n'xt batch…" Waving her hand, the Major Drunk walked away from the table limply.  
「嗯……我去补个妆……」醉醺醺的声音传来，美里摇摇晃晃地站起身。「我要漂漂亮亮地……迎接下一轮……」她无力地挥了挥手，踉跄着离开了桌子。

Ritsuko rolled her eyes, unable to make sense of Misato's inarticulate mumblings. "Typical Misato isn't it? Drinks her problems away…"  
律子翻了个白眼，无法理解美里含糊不清的嘟囔。「典型的美里，不是吗？用酒精来逃避问题……」

"Well, everyone has their own ways to deal with their issues," Kaji chuckled. His eyelids dropped as his thoughts drifted to his own world of darkness. "Still, it worries me that… she's drinking too much. I don't like seeing her losing control of herself like this."  
"嗯，每个人都有自己处理问题的方式，" 加持轻笑道。他的眼皮垂下，思绪飘向自己那片黑暗的世界。"不过，她喝得太多还是让我担心。我不喜欢看到她这样失去自我控制。"

"I see that you still care about her, even after that hard breakup you had," Ritsuko smirked. "Why didn't you just admit you love her?"  
"看来你还是关心她的，即使经历了那么痛苦的分手，" 律子微微一笑。"为什么不干脆承认你爱她呢？"

"I couldn't…" Kaji's gaze fell onto the table. "I have my own issues, too, from Second Impact… things I don't like thinking about. It's just easier that way."  
"我不能……" 加持的目光落在桌面上。"我自己也有第二次冲击带来的问题……有些事情我不想去想。这样更简单些。"

"Stubborn as all men…" Ritsuko shook her head. "Well, it's your own problems, who am I to question them?"  
"男人都这么固执……" 律子摇了摇头。"好吧，这是你自己的问题，我何必多问呢？"

"Speaking of which…" Kaji snapped his fingers, reaching for something inside his pocket. "I got you something you might like." Taking out a red trinket and placing it on the table, Kaji smirked. "This is a cat souvenir."  
"说到这个……" 加持打了个响指，伸手从口袋里掏东西。"我给你带了个你可能喜欢的东西。" 他拿出一个红色的小饰品放在桌上，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。"这是一个猫咪纪念品。"

Ritsuko accepted the small gift with a smile. Though her expression quickly turned serious after a careful examination of the object. Being a professional cat-lover, the blonde doctor had come across numerous trinkets before, including this one, but she was sure this specific type could only be found in one place. "What were you doing in Kyoto?"  
律子微笑着接受了这份小礼物。但仔细审视后，她的表情很快变得严肃起来。作为一名专业的猫咪爱好者，这位金发女医生见过许多类似的饰品，包括这一个，但她确信这种特定的类型只能在某个地方找到。"你去京都做什么了？"

Kaji leaned back in his seat, just a little wide-eyed. "I was visiting Matsushiro." He replied. "Why do you ask?"  
加持靠在椅背上，眼睛微微睁大。“我去了松代。”他回答道，“你为什么问这个？”

Knowing how well in terms of controlling emotions the special inspector was, Ritsuko knew such a reaction from him could be considered a jump-up for ordinary people. "You better be careful." She said in a stern voice after gazing at the man for a moment. "Aren't you afraid of getting burned? You should know better than anyone what typically happens to people who get burned in your line of work."  
深知这位特别检察官在控制情绪方面的能力，律子明白他的这种反应对普通人来说可能算是大惊小怪了。“你最好小心点。”她盯着他片刻后，用严肃的语气说道，“你难道不怕被烧伤吗？你应该比任何人都清楚，在你这种工作中，被烧伤的人通常会有什么下场。”

Instead of an immediate response, Kaji leaned back on his seat and rubbed his chin. He knew Ritsuko was right - he was indeed walking in the minefield. If he wasn't careful enough, he doubted Commander Ikari would keep ignoring the fact that he was de facto a spy.  
加持没有立即回应，而是靠回座位，揉了揉下巴。他知道律子说得没错——他的确是在雷区行走。如果不够小心，他怀疑碇司令不会一直无视他实际上是个间谍的事实。

"Hey guys, I'm back…" Misato Katsuragi's tired voice came to the duo. "So…who wants to keep going?" Asked the Major Alcoholic as she slumped down on her chair.  
"嘿，伙计们，我回来了……" 葛城美沙的声音疲惫地传到两人耳中。"那么……谁还想继续？" 这位酗酒少校一边问，一边瘫坐在椅子上。

"Well, I'm game!" Kaji exclaimed as he gulped down a bottle of beer in a single shot.  
"好啊，我奉陪！" 加持兴奋地喊道，一口气喝干了一瓶啤酒。

"Well, I'll leave you to it," Ritsuko sighed, getting up from her seat. "Have fun, you two."  
"那我就先失陪了，" 律子叹了口气，从座位上起身。"你们俩好好玩吧。"

"See ya, Ritz…" Misato slurred a response. "Now it leaves only me and the slob..."  
"再见，丽兹…" 美里含糊地回应道。"现在只剩下我和这个懒鬼了..."

"Be nice, Katsuragi." Kaji let out a sigh. "I might have to carry you home."  
"别这么说，葛城。" 加持叹了口气。"我可能得把你背回家了。"

"I'll be...fine. I can handle this myself." Misato hiccuped, a smell of alcohol spread into the air.  
"我会...没事的。我自己能应付。" 美里打了个嗝，酒气在空气中弥漫开来。"

"Sure you can…" Kaji muttered in defeat. Sighing, the ponytailed man stood up and went for the bar with the drunk woman following closely behind him.  
“当然可以……”加持低声嘀咕着，语气中带着无奈。叹了口气，这位马尾男子站起身，向吧台走去，那位醉酒的女子紧随其后。

The graveyard looked just like what Shinji had always remembered - thousands of grave markers stood idly on the ground, telling the eeriness and trepidation of the place. He stood in front of her mother's grave, 'Yui Ikari', her name was imprinted on the marble chunk. Gendo Ikari stood beside him, gazing at the endless grey sky above them covered by dark overcast.  
墓地看起来和真嗣记忆中的一样——成千上万的墓碑静静地矗立在地面上，透露出这个地方的阴森与不安。他站在她母亲的墓前，‘碇唯’，她的名字刻在那块大理石上。碇源堂站在他身旁，凝视着被乌云覆盖的灰暗天空。

Her mother's body wasn't even in her grave, and both of them knew that perfectly well. Still, this was the most appropriate place for remembrance.  
她母亲的遗体甚至不在墓中，这一点两人都心知肚明。即便如此，这里仍是缅怀的最佳场所。

He was sorely tempted not to come and spend more time with Asuka, considering this time his father had already known his true identity. However, such activity he had done so many times, it might as well be a timed ritual for him.  
他非常想不去见明日香，多花点时间陪她，考虑到这次他父亲已经知道他的真实身份。然而，这样的活动他已经做过太多次，对他来说几乎成了定时的仪式。

"Mother…" Shinji sighed. He hated her mother for her inaction when the Second Child needed his help the most, but he had to maintain a working relationship with her every time he sat inside Unit 01's entry plug.  
“妈妈……”真嗣叹了口气。他恨她的母亲在二号机驾驶员最需要帮助时无所作为，但每次他坐在初号机插入栓里时，又不得不与她保持工作关系。

"It's not the memories that we keep that are important." Gendo Ikari spoke, keeping a straight face as he looked over his son's shoulder. "It's the legacy we leave behind."  
“重要的不是我们保留的记忆。”碇源堂说道，面无表情地从儿子的肩膀上方看过去。“而是我们留下的遗产。”

"Legacy? Did my mother leave any of them?" Shinji turned his head to face his father, not fully able to decipher his emotions.  
“遗产？我母亲留下了什么吗？” 真嗣转头面对父亲，无法完全解读他的情绪。

"Yui left behind two legacies." Gendo's tone was calm and collected as it always was. "The Evangelion, and you."  
“唯留下了两份遗产。” 源渡的语气一如既往地平静而沉着，“初号机，还有你。”

"I'm her legacy?" Shinji couldn't believe what he thought he had heard; was his father actually showing some kind of support? He would rather believe that this was simply his father's way of manipulating him. He had to admit that this might work before, but the hatred toward his father had already wholly suppressed any positive feelings.  
“我是她的遗产？” 真嗣不敢相信自己所听到的；父亲竟然在表现出某种支持？他宁愿相信这只是父亲操纵他的手段。他不得不承认这可能曾经有效，但如今对父亲的恨意已经完全压制了任何正面情感。

"Of course." Gendo replied. "All the things that you accomplish will give meaning to Yui's life."  
"当然。" 源渡回答道。"你所完成的一切将为唯的生命赋予意义。"

Shinji blinked. His father had never said anything like this ever before. Was it because he knew about his looping status, and since he was now helping him, Gendo could actually let down some of his guards? "Hey, father?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他的父亲从未说过这样的话。是因为他知道了自己的循环状态，既然现在他在帮助他，源渡能真正放下一些防备吗？"嘿，爸爸？"

"What?" The old Ikari's tone was still cold.  
"什么事？" 老碇的语气依旧冰冷。

"When you met Mom, how did you know you were in love?"  
"当你遇见妈妈时，你是怎么知道你爱上她的？"

Commander Ikari found relief in the fact that Shinji was facing away from him. Otherwise, he might've seen his eyes go wide from the question. "The other mes… didn't tell you?"  
碇司令在得知真嗣背对着他时松了一口气。否则，他可能会看到自己因这个问题而瞪大了眼睛。"另一个我……没告诉你吗？"

"No. Not that I could remember." Replied Shinji truthfully.  
"没有。至少我记不得了。" 真嗣如实回答道。"

Gendo's gaze fell upon the imprinted name on the grave marker. "It's a long story…"  
源堂的目光落在墓碑上刻印的名字上。“说来话长……”

"I'm willing to listen." Shinji put both of his hands clasped together behind his head.  
“我愿意听。”真嗣将双手交叉放在脑后。

"When I was in college…I had always been alone. In fact, I wanted to be left alone. I was disappointed by the human society, which is one of the reasons I wanted to join SEELE."  
“当我还在上大学的时候……我一直都是一个人。事实上，我想要独处。我对人类社会感到失望，这也是我想加入 SEELE 的原因之一。”

"I tended to get into street fights a lot." Shinji almost chuckled at that admission.  
“我以前经常卷入街头斗殴。” 碇真嗣几乎因为这个自白而轻笑出声。

"One day after a bad fight, professor Fuyutsuki came found me, and bailed me out of jail."  
“有一天，在一场糟糕的打斗之后，冬月教授找到了我，把我从监狱里保释出来。”

"It was then I met her, your mother, Yui. She was professor Fuyutsuki's top student at that time."  
“就是在那时我遇见了她，你的母亲，碇唯。她是当时冬月教授最优秀的学生。”

"At first I didn't really like her that much. She was harsh, tough to handle. But I could see the compassionate and the caring side of her." Shinji's eyes went wide a little.  
"起初我并不太喜欢她。她严厉，难以相处。但我能看到她那充满同情和关怀的一面。" 真嗣的眼睛微微睁大了些。

"She had connections with SEELE, a secret organization I craved to get in, so I thought I could use her as my bridge. We spent more time together and fell in love."  
"她与 SEELE 有联系，一个我渴望加入的秘密组织，所以我以为可以利用她作为我的桥梁。我们相处的时间越来越多，最终坠入了爱河。"

"No one loved me after your grandparents, so when she said 'I love you'…she was the only thing that mattered to me in the world. She made me open up my heart to the world."  
"在你祖父母之后，没有人再爱过我，所以当她说'我爱你'时……她成了我在这个世界上唯一在乎的人。她让我敞开心扉去拥抱这个世界。"

"Then SEELE came in. And I think you know the rest." Gendo Ikari trailed off, leaving Shinji with his turmoil of thoughts in his head.  
“然后 SEELE 介入了。我想剩下的你都知道了。”碇源堂话音渐弱，留下真嗣脑海中翻腾的思绪。

His father's experience…why did it sound…  
他父亲的经历……为何听起来……

"Shinji…" Gendo started up again after a long-lasting silence. "Do you hate me?"  
“真嗣…” 碇源堂在长时间的沉默后再次开口。“你恨我吗？”

"Absolutely," Shinji blurted out. It was one of the few things he was still sure of at the moment.  
“当然恨，”真嗣脱口而出。这是他此刻为数不多还能确定的事情之一。

"Is it because of the Second Child?" Seeing Shinji nod, Gendo continued. "No offense…but I personally don't see anything likable from the behavior of the Second Child."  
“是因为二号适格者吗？”看到真嗣点头，碇源堂继续说道。“无意冒犯……但我个人并不觉得二号适格者的行为有什么值得喜欢的地方。”

After musing for a long moment, Shinji spoke up. "Before, I hated you because you abandoned me when I was four. I tried to do anything for you just to get your affection, and I thought piloting the EVA could help me get it. But I was wrong."  
沉思良久后，真嗣开口了。“之前，我恨你是因为你在我四岁时抛弃了我。我试图做任何事情来赢得你的爱，我以为驾驶 EVA 能帮我得到它。但我错了。”

"You never gave me what I wanted from you. I was merely your tool to reunite with mother."  
“你从未给我想要的。我只是你用来与母亲重聚的工具。”

"When I had enough of it and tried to run away, she came into my life." Even though he didn't specify her name, Gendo was sure whom he was referring to.  
“当我受够了这一切并试图逃跑时，她进入了我的生活。”尽管他没有明确指出她的名字，但碇源堂确信他指的是谁。

"Actually when I first met her, I could even say I was irritated by her attitude. Everything she did annoyed me. She made fun of me, humiliated me, and even physically assaulted me."  
"实际上，我第一次遇见她时，甚至可以说我对她的态度感到恼火。她做的每件事都让我心烦。她取笑我，羞辱我，甚至还对我进行身体攻击。"

"Her attitude and behavior were so confusing...even though most of her actions told me that she hated me, sometimes she showed me the other side of her that no one else knew."  
"她的态度和行为如此令人困惑...尽管她的许多行为告诉我她讨厌我，但有时她会向我展示别人不知道的另一面。"

"She was so strong and confident, while I merely tried my best to just…survive."  
"她如此坚强自信，而我只是尽力...生存下去。"

"I didn't know what of her attracted me. Maybe it was because of the loneliness she occasionally showed me, or maybe I thought she could understand me."  
"我不知道她身上有什么吸引了我。也许是因为她偶尔向我展示的孤独，或者我认为她能理解我。"

"That one night…when she cried for momma, I knew she was just like me."  
"那个夜晚……当她为妈妈哭泣时，我知道她和我是同类。"

"Gradually, every time she gets hurt…or if she turns away from me, it hurts me so much…"  
“渐渐地，每次她受伤…或是她从我身边转身离去，都让我心如刀割…”

"Oppositely, whenever she smiles at me...brings me farther away from the cliff of completely losing myself."  
"相反，每当她对我微笑……都让我远离彻底迷失自我的悬崖边缘。"

"And then _you_ hurt her." Shinji's tone turned 180 degrees from sorrowful to freezingly deep, eliciting a shiver ran down Gendo's spine.  
"然后你伤害了她。" 真嗣的语气从悲伤一转而为冰冷深沉，令源堂不由得打了个寒颤。

The older Ikari's eyelids dropped. Even though he didn't want to admit it, one of the reasons he abandoned him ten years ago was he didn't wish for Shinji to turn into a man like him. Now though, it seemed the plan had backfired – now he was more Gendo than Gendo himself.  
年长的碇的眼睛垂了下来。尽管他不愿承认，十年前抛弃真嗣的原因之一，就是他不希望真嗣变成像他这样的人。然而现在，计划似乎适得其反——如今真嗣比他自己更像碇源堂。

What had he done? 他究竟做了什么？

"What would you do…if she's…no more?" Gendo questioned, trying to keep his voice calm but still let worry flow out from his voice.  
“如果她……不在了呢？”源堂问道，努力保持声音平静，却仍流露出担忧。

"Simple. I end the world." As much as he didn't want to do it, in fact in his earlier cycles, even if Asuka was gone he would still try to fix the world. Now though, he had been through enough and lost enough to the extent he didn't care anymore. Not to mention without Asuka, he stood absolutely zero chance of winning against SEELE.  
“很简单。我终结这个世界。”尽管他并不想这么做，事实上在他早期的循环中，即使明日香不在了，他仍会试图拯救世界。但现在，他经历了太多，失去了太多，以至于他不再在乎了。更不用说没有明日香，他绝对没有机会战胜 SEELE。

Gendo Ikari was taken aback by the bluntness of his response, but soon regained his composure. After all, he was basically doing the same thing, wasn't he?  
源堂·伊卡里被他直率的回答惊到，但很快恢复了镇定。毕竟，他基本上也在做同样的事情，不是吗？

At the moment Shinji seemed to hear a soft rustling sound coming not far away from him. He turned his head but found no one. Shaking the illusions off, he continued. "Nothing else in the world matters to me, anyway. There's nobody who can take her place."  
此刻，真嗣似乎听到不远处传来一阵轻微的沙沙声。他转过头去，却没发现任何人。他摇摇头驱散幻觉，继续前行。“对我来说，世界上其他一切都无关紧要。没有人能取代她的位置。”

"I love her, absolutely. I love Asuka. No, love couldn't even properly describe it."  
"我爱她，绝对是真心的。我爱明日香。不，爱这个词甚至不足以准确描述这种感情。"

"She anchors me to the reality. Without her, I'd have already lost my mind…inside this endless madness."  
"她让我脚踏实地。没有她，我早已在这无尽的疯狂中失去理智。"

Gendo felt a tug at his heart. Wasn't Yui the only one that gave him direction as well? His own life would've been entirely meaningless without her, wouldn't it?  
碇源堂感到心中一阵牵动。难道不是只有唯给了他方向吗？没有她，他的人生岂不是完全失去了意义？

"Even your mother doesn't mean anything to you anymore?"  
“即使是你母亲对你来说也毫无意义了吗？”

"I guess I need her help in battles, but outside of that? Absolutely not." This time his voice didn't waver the slightest.  
“我想在战斗中我需要她的帮助，但除此之外？绝对不。”这一次，他的声音没有丝毫动摇。

"I see." Gendo slowly let out the words. If it wasn't sanity telling him otherwise, Shinji could swear his voice carried a hint of sadness in it.  
"我明白了。" 碇缓慢地吐出这几个字。如果不是理智在提醒他，真嗣几乎可以发誓他的声音中带着一丝悲伤。

"I should…probably get going right now." Sighing, Shinji turned away from the grave marker. "Asuka's alone at home, and I don't want to let her wait for too long."  
“我应该…现在就动身了。” 叹了口气，真嗣转身离开了墓碑。“明日香一个人在家，我不想让她等太久。”

Gendo nodded. "I understand."  
碇源堂点了点头。“我明白。”

Understand? That he needed to get to Asuka's side as soon as possible, or something more profound? Shinji felt his father was implying more. Nevertheless, it was not exactly the best time to muse on such things right now. Asuka was alone at home, and he needed to go back soon.  
明白？是指他需要尽快赶到明日香身边，还是更深层次的含义？真嗣觉得父亲暗示了更多。然而，现在并不是深思这些的最佳时机。明日香一个人在家，他需要尽快回去。

"See you later…father." Saying, Shinji went on his way home, leaving the older Ikari standing silently in front of the grave marker with his hurricane of thoughts.  
“再见……爸爸。” 说着，真嗣踏上了回家的路，留下年长的碇在墓碑前静静站立，思绪如狂风暴雨般翻涌。

None of the two noticed a pair of sapphire eyes behind one of the grave markers staring at them in utter shock.  
两人都没有注意到，在一座墓碑后面，一双蓝宝石般的眼睛正震惊地盯着他们。

Katsuragi's hours of binging finally came to a peak at her twelfth shot. She bent over a trashcan in a back alley, vomiting into it while Kaji held her hair back. She was expelling the contents of her stomach quite violently, and besides supporting her, Kaji was holding Misato's hair, so she didn't get chunks of vomit caught in her long lavender hair.  
葛城连续狂饮数小时后，终于在第十二杯时达到了顶峰。她弯腰在一条后巷的垃圾桶旁呕吐，加持帮她撩起头发。她吐得非常猛烈，除了支撑她，加持还帮忙托着美里紫色的长发，以免呕吐物粘在她的长发上。

She retched one last time before slumping down, going limp as her ex-lover held onto her to keep her on her feet. He handed her a bottle of water he was able to grab before heading out, which she was more than happy to snatch out of his hands. The lavender-haired woman chugged down a few gulps, and then spit out the rest into the alleyway, getting rid of anything that was left behind in the transition from her stomach to the trashcan.  
她最后一次干呕后瘫软下来，身体无力地靠在前恋人身上，他扶着她让她不至于倒下。他递给她一瓶出门前抓起的水，她急切地从他手中夺过。紫发的女子猛灌了几口，然后将剩下的吐进了小巷里，把从胃里到垃圾桶的残留物清理干净。

"Drinking till you throw up, how old are you? We're not in college anymore." Kaji shook his head. "You don't need to drink yourself sick."  
“喝到吐，你多大了？我们不再是大学生了。”卡吉摇了摇头。“你不需要把自己喝得生病。”

"Old enough to regret it," Misato said weakly as she stumbled along the way. "So much stuff's been happening lately… you'd drink a lot too if you were me. All that NERV and Shinji and Asuka business…"  
“足够大到后悔了，”美里虚弱地说着，踉跄前行。“最近发生了太多事……如果你是我，也会喝很多的。全是 NERV、真嗣和明日香那些事……”

"You and I both know this has nothing to do with Asuka or Shinji," the special inspector frowned a little. "It worries me to see you like this, that's all."  
"你我都知道这与明日香或真嗣无关，" 特别检察官微微皱眉。"看到你这样，我感到很担忧，仅此而已。

"Well, I'm like this a lot, just mostly at home, that way, I'm not staggering home drunk…" Misato admitted. "Can you help me up, Kaji?"  
"嗯，我经常这样，只是大多在家里，这样我就不会醉醺醺地回家了……" 美里承认道。"你能扶我起来吗，加持？

"Of course." Kaji said as he turned her around and lifted her up onto his back, holding her legs up with his hands while she loosely wrapped her arms around his neck, her high heels dangling from her fingers. "Would you rather I carry you to your apartment?"  
"当然。" 加持说着将她转过身，背起她，双手托住她的双腿，而她则松松地环住他的脖子，高跟鞋在她手指间晃荡。"你宁愿我把你送到公寓吗？"

"Yeah, I'm having trouble in these high heels, the world keeps turning…" Misato slurred.  
"是啊，这高跟鞋让我走不稳，世界一直在转……" 美里含糊地说道。

"Of course it is…" Kaji sighed.  
"当然会这样……" 加持叹了口气。

"Thanks, Kaji…" "谢谢，卡吉…"

Kaji began the walk back in silence, hoping not to disrupt Misato's very-needed rest after her binge drinking. Though his assumption that Misato was sleeping was wrong; moments later a weak voice floated to him.  
加治默默地开始往回走，希望不打扰到美里因酗酒而急需的休息。尽管他以为美里在睡觉的猜测是错误的；片刻之后，一个微弱的声音飘向他。

"Kaji," Misato spoke up, breaking the silence. "I think I've changed."  
“加治，”美里打破了沉默，“我觉得我变了。”

"You're right." He smirked. "You're even prettier than when I met you in college." Sweet-talking had always been one of his lady-killing moves, the lavender-haired woman had to hide her smile. "Not what I meant." Her tone sounded much more serious, a sharp contrast from Kaji's lightheartedness.  
“你说得对。”他微微一笑，“你甚至比我们在大学相遇时更漂亮了。”甜言蜜语一直是他征服女性的手段之一，这位紫罗兰色头发的女子不得不掩饰自己的微笑。“我不是那个意思。”她的语气听起来严肃得多，与加治的轻松态度形成鲜明对比。

She took in a deep breath and exhaled before continuing. "I'm sorry that I wanted to break up with you. When I told you there was another man, I lied." She looked over at him, seeing that he was keeping his eyes straight forward, not the least bit phased by her words. "But you already knew that, didn't you?"  
她深吸一口气，缓缓吐出，然后继续说道：“对不起，我曾想和你分手。当我告诉你有另一个男人时，那是谎话。”她瞥向他，见他目光直视前方，对她的言辞丝毫不为所动。“但你早就知道了吧？”

"No." He lied. Of course from the day she said she wanted to break up with him because there was another man, he knew she was lying. Being a well-trained spy, half of his job description was being able to read people through their masks. "Though I had a feeling that…you did it to make me say what you desperately wanted to hear from me."  
"不。" 他撒了谎。当然，从她那天说想分手因为有另一个男人开始，他就知道她在撒谎。作为一名训练有素的间谍，他工作的一半内容就是透过面具读懂人心。“虽然我有种感觉……你这么做是为了让我说出你迫切想从我这里听到的话。”

"Well, you're right…" Misato raised her head and looked up at the sky. At the moment the thick grey overcast had become thin, and the moonlight was occasionally peeking through the cracks between the layers of clouds. "I suddenly realized how much like my father you were…always caught up in the line of work and never paid enough attention to me." Kaji kept his eyes focused on her, but did not rear his head. "I couldn't believe that I wanted a man just like my father. I was terrified." Misato looked over at her ex-lover, and frowned. "So I ran. I was afraid of being with you. I thought I hated my father." She took in a breath, sucking in the night air.  
"嗯，你说得对……" 美里抬起头，望向天空。此刻厚重的灰色云层变得稀薄，月光偶尔从云层的缝隙中透出。"我突然意识到你有多像我父亲……总是忙于工作，从未给予我足够的关注。" 加持始终注视着她，却没有抬起头。"我无法相信自己想要一个像我父亲那样的男人。我感到恐惧。" 美里看向她的前恋人，皱起了眉头。"所以我逃了。我害怕与你在一起。我以为我恨我的父亲。" 她深吸一口气，吸入夜晚的空气。

"And then I fell in love with a man just like him." She lowered her head. "I thought joining NERV would be a way to sever those ties. And then it turned out my father was with NERV. So then I just tried to bury it all by swearing my life to avenge him by killing the Angels."  
"然后我爱上了像他一样的男人。" 她低下头。"我以为加入 NERV 可以切断这些联系。结果发现我父亲也在 NERV。于是我试图通过发誓为杀死使徒来为他复仇，以此埋葬这一切。"

"You chose that path, Katsuragi." He tried his best to sound reassuring. "You don't have to feel bad about it. None of this is your fault."  
"你选择了那条路，葛城。" 他尽力让自己的声音听起来安慰。"你不必为此感到内疚。这一切都不是你的错。"

"Don't bullshit me, Kaji! That was not my choice!" She snapped, raising her volume. "I just ran away! I just wanted to escape from the real world and my father!"  
"别跟我胡扯，加持！那不是我的选择！" 她厉声说道，提高了音量。"我只是逃跑了！我只是想逃离现实世界和我父亲！"

"Misato, there's no need to apologize, I forgave you long ago," said Kaji in a soft voice.  
"美里，没必要道歉，我早就原谅你了，" 加持用柔和的声音说道。

"Well, the problem is, I loved you…" Misato's voice turned tenderer as well. "But did you love me?"  
"问题是，我爱你……" 美里的声音也变得温柔起来。"但你爱我吗？"

"Of course I did, Misato…" Kaji's eyes went wide slightly. "I never stopped."  
"当然我做了，美里…" 加持的眼睛微微睁大。"我从未停止过。"

"But why couldn't you say it?!" Misato cried. "It's only four simple letters…"  
"但为什么你不能说出来？！" 美里哭喊道。"这只是四个简单的字母…"

"You know why I can't…I can't say it to anyone because I haven't forgiven myself for…my brother's death."  
"你知道我为什么不能…我不能对任何人说，因为我还没有原谅自己…我哥哥的死。"

Misato pushed herself down from Kaji's back and staggered away from him a bit. Kaji caught her and held her tight, their faces merely inches from each other. "Ryoji…" Misato mumbled. "I can't believe I still want you."  
美里从加持的背上撑起身，踉跄地离开他几步。加持抓住她，紧紧拥入怀中，两人的脸庞仅相隔几英寸。“加持……”美里喃喃道，“我真不敢相信我还想要你。”

"I can." Looking directly into her eyes, Kaji smiled lovingly. "You never stopped, and neither did I."  
“我能。”加持直视着她的眼睛，温柔地微笑，“你从未停止过，我也一样。”

"Wha-" “什——”

She was brought to silence as Kaji held her close to him and locked his lips with hers. Misato's entire body began to tremble in his arms as he kissed her. Suddenly she felt a lightness in her left hand as she dropped her high heels onto the ground, making a hollow clack as they landed. Though, other than the man who held her that time, she didn't care about anything else.  
当加持将她紧紧拥入怀中，双唇相锁时，她陷入了沉默。在加持的亲吻下，美里全身开始在他臂弯中颤抖。突然间，她感到左手一轻，高跟鞋掉落在地，发出空洞的咔嗒声。然而，除了当时拥抱着她的那个男人，她对其他一切都漠不关心。

Shinji hummed Ode to Joy as he paced back to the apartment. Today went better than he had been expecting – he was positively surprised that his father would open up to him, at least partially. Even though it helped a little changing his perception of his father, considering the countless crimes 'Gendo Ikari' had committed, he still felt happy about it.  
真嗣哼着《欢乐颂》，缓步走回公寓。今天的情况比他预想的要好得多——他父亲至少愿意向他敞开心扉，这让他感到意外的惊喜。尽管改变对父亲的看法只是微不足道的一步，考虑到‘碇源堂’犯下的无数罪行，他依然为此感到高兴。

Not to mention he finally learned about his father and mother from a first-personal perspective. It would help him a lot in the future – if this cycle turned out to be a failure as well.  
更不用说他终于从第一人称的视角了解到了父亲和母亲的故事。这将对他未来大有裨益——如果这个循环最终也以失败告终的话。

The downside, though, was he spent more time with his father at the graveyard than he normally would have. The day was turning dark, and he _almost_ regrated talking with Gendo so long, considering the opportunity cost was spending less time with Asuka.  
不过，缺点是他花在墓地与父亲相处的时间比平时多了。天色渐暗，他几乎后悔与源堂聊了这么久，考虑到机会成本是与明日香相处的时间减少了。

"Tadaima," he announced as he slipped his shoes off in the corridor. "Asuka? Are you home?" He called out, wondering why he received no replies whatsoever.  
“我回来了，”他一边在走廊脱鞋一边宣布。“明日香？你在家吗？”他喊道，纳闷为何没有得到任何回应。

Maybe she was at Hikari's place just like she said? Shaking his head, Shinji walked through the corridor and entered the living room. "Oh hi Asuka, so you _are_ at home," Shinji greeted as he saw the redhead standing in front of the couch instead of sitting on it. "Are you bored? How about some video ga-" He trailed off as he noticed the unreadable mixture of expressions on her face.  
也许她像她说的那样在光那里？晃了晃头，真嗣穿过走廊进入客厅。“哦，嗨明日香，原来你在家，”真嗣看到红发女孩站在沙发前而不是坐在上面时打招呼道。“你无聊吗？要不要玩点电子游戏——”他话音未落，注意到她脸上那难以解读的复杂表情。

Asuka stood there, crossing her arms together in front of her chest in a defensive posture and glaring at him with a soul-piercing look, as if wanting to cut him open and make him spill all of the secrets inside him.  
明日香站在那里，双臂交叉于胸前，摆出一副防御的姿态，用一种能穿透灵魂的目光瞪着他，仿佛想要将他剖开，让他吐露所有秘密。

"Asuka, are you alrigh-" “明日香，你还好吗——”

He was cut off by Asuka's abruptly raised hand. Slowly, she spoke up.  
他话未说完就被明日香突然举起的手打断。她缓缓开口。

"Today. At graveyard. I heard you."  
“今天。在墓地。我听到你了。”

Shinji felt his blood turn icy cold.  
真嗣感到血液变得冰冷。

*第 22 章*: 第 22 章：承诺

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion, nor do I own RE-TAKE.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，也不拥有《RE-TAKE》。

**Chapter 22: Promises 第二十二章：承诺**

Asuka Langley Soryu jogged on the street, heading to the graveyard she knew where Shinji would be at. The sky was covered by thick overcast, and she was afraid of getting caught in the rain, but considering the only alternative would be bored to death, she could only accept the risk.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷沿着街道慢跑，前往她知道真嗣会在的墓地。天空被厚厚的云层覆盖，她担心会被雨淋到，但考虑到唯一的替代方案是闷得要死，她只能接受这个风险。

Standing in front of the main entrance of the graveyard, Asuka cringed as she saw a literal forest of black grave markers standing on the ground. She didn't know how many of them were caused by Angel attacks, how many of those lives could have been saved if she had performed better in battles.  
站在墓地的主入口前，明日香看到地面上密密麻麻的黑色墓碑，不禁皱起了眉头。她不知道其中有多少是天使袭击造成的，有多少生命本可以在她战斗表现更好时被挽救。

Nonetheless, she didn't exactly feel guilty about it. It wasn't her fault that the Angels attacked them, after all.  
尽管如此，她并没有真正感到内疚。毕竟，天使袭击他们并不是她的错。

Taking a deep breath and walking into the graveyard area, Asuka scanned around, trying to locate where Shinji was at. A smirk came to her face as she saw two human silhouettes standing next to each other, a stark disparity from the neatly and uniformly arranged grave markers made it conspicuous.  
深吸一口气，走进墓地区域，明日香环顾四周，试图找到真嗣的位置。当她看到两个人影并肩站立时，嘴角露出了微笑，与整齐划一排列的墓碑形成鲜明对比，显得格外显眼。

Her logic told her the other person standing beside Shinji was Commander Ikari, and her own eyes soon proved it true. From the looks of it, they were chatting about something, Asuka suddenly felt hesitant to intrude. After all, it was their family reunion, as an outsider, there's a high chance that she wouldn't be welcomed-  
她的逻辑告诉她，站在真嗣旁边的人是碇司令，而她的眼睛很快证实了这一点。从外表看，他们似乎在谈论什么，明日香突然感到犹豫是否该打扰。毕竟，这是他们的家庭团聚，作为一个外人，她很可能会不受欢迎——

"…the Second Child." “……第二适格者。”

Asuka's eyebrows raised as she thought she heard her designation. Curiosity started an absolute massacre on her internal battlefield of whether or not to go to them. Slowly and lightly walking toward the duo, Asuka perked up her ears and eavesdropped.  
听到自己的称呼，明日香眉头一挑。好奇心在她内心是否接近他们的战场上掀起了一场绝对的大屠杀。她缓缓地、轻轻地走向那两人，竖起耳朵偷听。

"…she came into my life." Asuka felt her breath quicken. She? Was he talking about the other girl he mentioned before? The redhead couldn't hear their conversation clearly, but getting any closer would risk her being discovered. Not that she was afraid of getting caught, but she was curious to see where this conversation would lead to, even though she dreaded to hear more of Shinji's possible romantic history.  
“……她走进了我的生活。”明日香感到呼吸加快。她？他是在说之前提到的那个女孩吗？红发少女听不清他们的对话，但再靠近就会冒着被发现的危险。倒不是她害怕被抓到，只是她好奇这场对话会如何发展，尽管她害怕听到更多关于真嗣可能的恋爱史。

Hiding behind another grave marker, Asuka listened in.  
躲在另一个墓碑后面，明日香侧耳倾听。

"…first met her, I could even say I was irritated by her attitude…made fun of me, humiliated me, and even physically assaulted me."  
……第一次见到她时，我甚至可以说被她的态度惹恼了……她取笑我，羞辱我，甚至还对我进行身体攻击。

What? Asuka raised an eyebrow. This sounded disturbingly similar to-  
什么？明日香挑了挑眉。这听起来令人不安地相似于——

"…attitude and behavior were so confusing...most of her actions told me that she hated me, sometimes she showed me the other side of her that no one else…"  
"…态度和行为如此令人困惑...她的大多数举动都让我觉得她恨我，但有时她又会向我展示无人知晓的另一面…"

"…so strong and confident, while I merely tried my best to just…survive."  
"…如此坚强自信，而我只是尽力…生存下去。"

"I didn't know what of her attracted me…because of the loneliness she occasionally showed me…she could understand me." Okay. Now Asuka knew Shinji was indeed talking about his romantic encounters. The logical side of her was screaming at her to stop listening, but she decided to continue. She needed to know about it if she wanted him all hers.  
"我不知道她哪一点吸引了我…也许是因为她偶尔流露出的孤独…她能理解我。" 好吧。现在明日香知道真嗣确实在谈论他的浪漫经历。她理智的一面在尖叫让她别再听下去，但她决定继续。如果她想完全拥有他，她需要了解这些。

"That one night…when she cried for momma, I knew she was just like me." Taking a sharp inhale, Asuka felt a shiver ran down her spine.  
“那一晚…当她哭着找妈妈时，我就知道她和我一样。”阿斯卡深吸一口气，感到一阵寒意窜过脊背。

"Gradually, every time she gets hurt…or if she turns away from me, it hurts me so much…"  
“渐渐地，每次她受伤…或是她从我身边转身离去，都让我心如刀割…”

"…whenever she smiles at me…brings me farther away…completely losing myself."  
“…每当她对我微笑…都让我越陷越深…彻底迷失自我。”

"...nd then you…" "...然后你…"

"What would you do…if she's…" She couldn't make out what Commander Ikari said from his cold and husky voice.  
"你会怎么做…如果她是…" 她听不清碇司令那冷酷而沙哑的声音说了什么。

"...ple. I end…" "...人们。我结束…"

"Nothing else in the world matters to me, anyway…nobody who can take her place. I love her." _'Wow,'_ Asuka thought. Those were some serious confessions. She felt her heart sunk as the realization dawned on her. If he was so loyal, then there's no way she could have him completely hers. Tears, for the first time in a long while, threatened to come out from the corner of her eyes. Damn it, why did it hurt so much, knowing that she didn't have the slightest of chan-  
“世界上其他的一切对我都不重要……没有人能取代她。我爱她。” ‘哇，’ 明日香心想。这可是相当严肃的告白。她感到心沉了下去，当意识到这一点时。如果他如此忠诚，那么她完全拥有他是不可能的。泪水，久违地，开始在眼角涌动。该死，为什么知道她连一丝机会都没有会这么痛——

"I love Asuka." “我爱明日香。”

Oh.

Asuka's eyes went wide. 明日香的眼睛瞪大了。

"…anchors me to the reality...out her I'd have already lost my mind…inside this endless madness."  
"…将我锚定在现实中…没有她，我早已精神崩溃…在这无尽的疯狂之中。"

She forgot how to breathe.  
她忘记了如何呼吸。

"…your mother doesn't mean anything to you…" "…I need her help in battles, but outside of that? Absolutely not."  
"…你母亲对你来说毫无意义…" "…我需要她在战斗中帮忙，但除此之外？绝对没有。"

Asuka shot up from her spot and rushed to the exit of the graveyard. What the hell was that? She had a hard time believing what her brain told her she had heard. Shinji, the boy she desperately wanted, _absolutely loved_ her, more than his _mother?!_  
明日香猛地从她的位置上跳起来，冲向墓地的出口。那到底是什么鬼？她很难相信自己的大脑告诉她所听到的话。真嗣，那个她拼命想要得到的男孩，竟然绝对地爱着她，甚至超过爱他的母亲？！

She found it difficult to understand that he… If he had said it in front of her right there and then, she probably wouldn't give in to it. The similar phrases she had seen too many times from the absurd amount of date requests she received. She knew perfectly well they were all hollow and meaningless, and she never paid the slightest bit of attention to them.  
她发现很难理解他……如果他当时就在她面前说出来，她可能不会接受。她从那些荒谬的大量约会请求中见过太多类似的措辞。她非常清楚它们都是空洞无意义的，她从未对它们给予过丝毫关注。

However, he wasn't saying it for her to hear. He said it to his father, he confessed his feelings when he thought she couldn't listen to it. he meant everything he said. Asuka suddenly felt stupid doubting his true intentions before – though it wasn't really her fault since she thought no one would ever love her, let alone _more than anything else in the world._  
然而，他并不是说给她听的。他对他的父亲说，他在以为她听不到的时候坦白了自己的感情。他说的每一句话都是真心的。明日香突然觉得自己之前怀疑他的真实意图真是愚蠢——尽管这并不完全是她的错，因为她一直认为没有人会爱她，更不用说爱得超过世界上其他任何事物了。

Nothing else mattered to him anymore...not even his mother. There were still people other than Shinji she cared about, Kaji, Misato, Hikari...even wondergirl.  
对他来说，什么都不再重要了……甚至包括他的母亲。除了真嗣，她还有其他关心的人，加持、美里、光……甚至是那个奇迹女孩。

Hyperventilating, Asuka burst into the apartment and slammed the door shut. Sliding down to the ground against the wall, Asuka buried her face in her hands.  
过度换气的明日香冲进公寓，砰地一声关上门。她顺着墙滑坐在地上，双手掩面。

Did she love him as much as he loved her?  
她对他的爱，是否和他对她的爱一样深？

Probably not... 大概不会...

But did she love him?  
但她爱他吗？

There's one way to make sure herself…  
有一种方法可以确保她自己…

Asuka regained some of her semblances and deeply inhaled. Crossing her arms in front of her chest, she waited for the inevitable.  
明日香恢复了一些神态，深深地吸了一口气。她交叉双臂抱在胸前，等待着不可避免的事情。

"Today. At graveyard. I heard you."  
“今天。在墓地。我听到你了。”

Asuka glared at the frozen form of Shinji Ikari with an illegible mix of expressions, her sapphire pupil sparkling intensely. The apartment was dead silent, with occasional chirpy sounds of cicadas in the distance.  
明日香盯着真嗣一动不动的身影，眼神中混杂着难以解读的情绪，蓝宝石般的瞳孔闪烁着强烈的光芒。公寓里死寂无声，远处偶尔传来蝉鸣的欢快声响。

"A-Asuka, wha-what did you hear?" Finally, Shinji spoke up after taking a deep breath. He didn't remember saying anything about his looping status, and that's the only fact that was keeping him sane right now.  
"A-明日香，你-你听到了什么？" 终于，真嗣在深吸一口气后开口了。他不记得自己说过任何关于循环状态的事，而这唯一的事实正是他此刻保持理智的支柱。

"Close your eyes." Came Asuka's abrupt request, her voice plain yet carried a subtle hint of determination.  
"闭上眼睛。" 明日香突然要求道，她的声音平淡却隐含着一丝微妙的决心。

"What?" "什么？"

"I said close your eyes."  
"我说了，闭上眼睛。"

Shinji did as she said so. He could hear Asuka slowly walking toward him, each heavy footstep of her like the countdowns of a timing bomb as it put more pressure on top of his heart. The sound of footsteps stopped as he could literally feel her breath tickling his face. What was she going to do? Slap him? Kick him in the balls? Or-  
真嗣照她说的做了。他能听到明日香缓缓向他走来，每一步沉重的脚步声都像是定时炸弹的倒计时，让他的心脏承受着更大的压力。脚步声停止时，他几乎能感觉到她的呼吸轻拂着他的脸颊。她要做什么？扇他耳光？踢他的下体？还是——

Having Asuka's soft and tender lips on his – he missed it a lot - was not an unfamiliar sensation to him, so he recognized it within one second after his brain registered the feeling. Instead of abruptly jumping away from the sudden surprise like what he would've done a long while ago which had been proven disastrous, Shinji quickly composed himself and wrapped his arms around the redhead's waist.  
明日香柔软温润的唇贴在他的唇上——他非常怀念这种感觉——对他来说并不陌生，所以在他的大脑感受到这种感觉的一秒钟内就认了出来。与很久以前可能会因为突如其来的惊喜而猛然跳开的灾难性反应不同，真嗣迅速镇定下来，双臂环抱住红发少女的腰间。

Cracking his eyes open slightly, he saw Asuka's eyes closed shut, her cheeks blushing the faintest bit of pink. Moments later, she started to make some content 'hmmm' sighs, raising her arms and holding him in a loose embrace as well.  
他微微睁开眼睛，看到明日香紧闭双眼，脸颊泛起淡淡的粉红色。片刻之后，她开始发出满足的'嗯嗯'声，抬起双臂，也松松地拥抱着他。

Asuka wanted to gasp as she felt something slip between her lips; she wanted to stop and maybe even yell at him for taking this a little bit farther than she intended it to go. Yet her body found no reasons to resist him. This was what she wanted and had been missing. Her first kiss was after she and Shinji's sortie against Ramiel when she performed CPR to save his life. She thought it felt nice, _pleasant_, but it was nothing when compared to what she was experiencing right now.  
当感觉到有什么东西滑入她的唇间时，明日香本想倒吸一口气；她想停下来，甚至可能对他大喊，因为他把这事儿做得比她预期的更深入了一些。然而，她的身体却找不到任何抗拒他的理由。这就是她所渴望且一直缺失的。她的初吻是在她和真嗣对抗雷米尔的出击后，她为了救他而进行心肺复苏时发生的。她觉得那感觉不错，愉快，但与现在所经历的相比，简直不值一提。

Even though she had abundant knowledge in the subject of matter, but they were only theoretical. And now she found even the theoretical descriptions couldn't be trusted anymore as she literally saw stars flashing in front of her eyes.  
尽管她在这一领域拥有丰富的知识，但那些都只是理论上的。而现在她发现，就连这些理论描述也不再可信，因为她眼前真的闪烁着星星。

Her body fell limp as she felt him push his weight against her, forcing her to lean against the wall while they continued to kiss. Asuka's heart was beating so hard as if it was a diesel engine, and she was sure Shinji could feel the pulse through her lips. She could feel his tongue playfully dancing with his, sending bolts of electricity ran down her spine. No longer being able to control her own body with reason anymore, Asuka gave in and let her impulse guide her to do what she thought she should do.  
她的身体在他压上来的重量下变得瘫软，被迫倚靠在墙上继续亲吻。明日香的心跳得如此剧烈，仿佛是一台柴油发动机，她确信真嗣能通过她的唇感受到那脉动。她能感觉到他的舌头与她的嬉戏共舞，一股股电流沿着她的脊椎窜下。理智再也无法控制自己的身体，明日香放弃了抵抗，任由冲动引导她去做她认为应该做的事。

The warm water penguin waddled his way across the living room, stopping briefly as he saw two teenagers doing the unmentionables. He shook his head and headed to his freezer. After all, he had seen weirder stuff from these two-legged creatures.  
那只温暖的水獭摇摇摆摆地穿过客厅，看到两个青少年在做不可描述的事情时，他短暂地停了下来。他摇了摇头，继续向冰箱走去。毕竟，他从这些两条腿的生物身上见过更奇怪的事情。

Slowly, the intensity of their make-out session died down, and the redhead pulled away from the Lala-land first, though keeping her tongue in contact with his until the last moment, making their kiss last as long as possible.  
渐渐地，他们亲热的强度减弱了，红发女孩首先从梦幻之地抽离，尽管在最后一刻仍保持舌头与他的接触，尽可能延长这个吻的时长。

"Wow," Asuka exhaled as she stumbled back a few steps and finally gained support from the armrest of the couch.  
“哇，”明日香喘着气，踉跄后退几步，最终靠在了沙发的扶手上。

"That was…very nice," Shinji followed, keeping his cobalt eyes in contact with her bright-blue ones. "Sorry I didn't brush my teeth." His brain was already failing to keep his other personas on since it was flooded with the pleasant sensation.  
“那真是……非常棒，”真嗣接着说，他的钴蓝色眼睛始终与她明亮的蓝色眼睛对视。“抱歉我没刷牙。”他的大脑已经无法维持其他人格，因为被愉悦的感觉淹没了。

Asuka grinned widely. "Thankfully, you don't have a bad breath, or I would've killed you." She leaned closer to him, her grin faded. "Today…you said you love me." From her previous behaviors, Shinji didn't expect anything less. "Do you mean it?" Although she was almost certain since when he said it, he had no way to know she was here, she still needed him to say it in front of her.  
明日香咧嘴笑了。“还好，你口气不臭，不然我早把你杀了。”她向他靠近，笑容渐渐消失。“今天……你说你爱我。”从她以往的行为来看，真嗣并不意外。“你是认真的吗？”尽管她几乎可以确定，因为他当时不可能知道她在这里，但她还是需要他当面说出来。

"Yes. I do." Shinji's reply came without even the slightest delay. After all, she had already heard much more serious confessions.  
"是的，我愿意。" 真嗣的回答几乎没有丝毫迟疑。毕竟，她已经听过更为严肃的告白了。

"Then…promise me." Asuka rested her head on his shoulder, whispering into his ear. "Promise me that you will only love me as long as you live."  
"那么…答应我。" 明日香将头靠在他的肩上，对着他的耳朵低语。"答应我，你将一生只爱我一人。"

"That you'll be mine, completely mine and no one else's." The fire inside her sapphire eyes grew increasingly intense as she continued.  
"你将完全属于我，只属于我一个人。" 她蓝宝石般的眼睛中的火焰随着她的话语愈发炽烈。

"From the top of your head to the bottom of your feet…is all mine." Asuka's body started to tremble.  
“从你的头顶到脚尖…都是我的。”明日香的身体开始颤抖。

"And you'll never leave me, you'll be mine, forever and always."  
"你永远不会离开我，你会属于我，永远永远。"

"If I can't have all of you…"  
"如果我不能拥有全部的你…"

"That you don't want anything from me?" Shinji followed, eliciting a surprised look from the redhead. She wasn't going to complain, though. "Good. Now…do you promise?"  
"你是说你不想从我这里得到什么？" 真嗣接着说，让红发女孩露出了惊讶的表情。不过，她并不打算抱怨。"很好。那么…你保证吗？"

Shinji closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. Just how many times had he heard the same request? And how many times had he failed to keep his promise? Even though he treated all of the Asukas in the same way, he knew each time once she learned about the truth, _she_ would mind.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。同样的请求他听过多少次了？他又多少次未能守住自己的承诺？尽管他对每一个明日香都一视同仁，但他知道一旦她得知真相，她总会介意。

He learned it from the first-hand experience, after all.  
毕竟，这是他从亲身经历中学到的。

The guilt of keeping the secret from her, _deceiving_ her, was chewing him alive. But he had no choice. It was better for both of them, much more so for Asuka, to let her not learn the truth. Still, sooner or later, one day she _will_ know his identity. It's just not today.  
对她的隐瞒和欺骗所产生的内疚感正一点点吞噬着他。但他别无选择。这对他们俩都好，尤其是对明日香来说，不让她知道真相更好。不过，迟早有一天，她会知道他的身份。只是不是今天。

Denying this promise right now would likely get him killed on the spot, which he was almost sure of. "I promise." He slowly let the words flow out but with unmovable determination in the voice. After all, it wasn't like he didn't want to make the promise - he would give up everything to keep it.  
此刻否认这个承诺很可能会让他当场丧命，对此他几乎可以肯定。“我承诺。”他缓缓吐出这些字眼，但语气中透露出不可动摇的决心。毕竟，他并非不想做出这个承诺——为了守住它，他愿意放弃一切。

Putting his hands wrapped around her torso once again, Shinji caressed her back in soft and gentle movements, calming down Asuka's shivering with each touch.  
真嗣再次将双手环绕在她的腰间，用轻柔的动作抚摸着她的背部，每一次触碰都让明日香颤抖的身体逐渐平静下来。

The redhead pulled away from his shoulder and looked him in the eyes. "Then from now on…if you ever dare to cheat on me, I'll kill you." Shinji nodded. "I would never."  
红发女孩从他的肩膀上移开，直视着他的眼睛。“那么从现在开始……如果你敢背叛我，我会杀了你。”真嗣点头。“我绝不会。”

"No…if you even touch another woman, if you even speak to another woman, I'll kill you." Even though she knew the request was unreasonable, but under the heat of the moment, she thought she could be bossy and capricious for this one time, a prospective candidate for the most critical moment of her life.  
“不……如果你敢碰其他女人，哪怕只是和她们说话，我都会杀了你。”尽管她知道这个要求无理取闹，但在那一刻的冲动下，她觉得可以任性一次，这或许是她人生最关键时刻的预演。

Shinji winced internally at the demand. Still, no matter what Asuka ordered him to do, he could see the _real_ her behind her mask, the vulnerable and fragile girl, pleading him for help…  
听到这个要求，真嗣内心一紧。然而，无论明日香命令他做什么，他都能透过她的面具看到真实的她，那个脆弱无助的女孩，在向他求助……

He had missed it once. And it cost him everything.  
他曾错过一次。而那一次，让他失去了所有。

Everything…and he's still trying to compensate for it…though, in the end, he would never find redemption from _her_ ever again.  
所有的一切……他仍在试图弥补……然而，最终，他再也无法从她那里得到救赎。

"Okay…from now on, I'll only talk to Asuka," he smiled a warm smile.  
“好吧……从现在起，我只和明日香说话，”他露出了温暖的笑容。

Asuka blinked, clearly taken aback by his boldness and acceptance of her capriciousness. Nonetheless, this was not the best time to question about it. "Idiot…" What was this new feeling flowing through her body? Arousal she could identify clearly since she had experienced it a lot, especially when sleeping next to and being held by him, but aside from that…  
"明日香眨了眨眼，显然被他的大胆和对她善变性的接受惊到了。尽管如此，现在并不是追问这个的最佳时机。“笨蛋……”这种新涌动在体内的感觉是什么？她能清晰地识别出性欲，毕竟她经历了很多，尤其是在他身边睡觉并被他抱着的时候，但除此之外……”

Was it love? Did she love him?  
是爱吗？她爱他吗？

Which elicited another wave of insecurity from the bottom of her mind. "Am I a better kisser?" She asked as she put her head on Shinji's chest, listening to his steady and strong heartbeat.  
"这在她心底引发了一波新的不安。“我接吻技术更好吗？”她将头靠在真嗣的胸口，聆听着他稳定而有力的心跳。”

"What are you talking about, Asuka?" Shinji's eyes went wide. There's no way she meant-  
"你在说什么呢，明日香？" 真嗣的眼睛瞪大了。她不可能是那个意思——

"The other girl…you mentioned before," Asuka tensed up as she spoke the words. "Am I a better kisser?"  
"你之前提到的那个女孩……" 明日香在说出这些话时紧张起来。"我是不是比她更会接吻？"

Shinji let out a long silent sigh of relief. It was understandable for her to ask such a question, though he still found it hard to answer. What was he supposed to say? The girl, the original Asuka Langley Soryu, someone he simultaneously loved and hurt the most, _did_ kiss him. But it was hardly a proper one, and nothing good came out of it as well.  
真嗣长长地松了一口气，无声地叹息。她会问这样的问题是可以理解的，尽管他仍然觉得难以回答。他该怎么说呢？那个女孩，原本的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，一个他既深爱又伤害最深的人，确实吻过他。但那根本算不上一个真正的吻，而且也没有带来任何好的结果。

Saying 'yes' would be a technically true statement, but it also insinuated he would be factually replacing her with this Asuka, which was something he would never allow himself to do. Sometimes, the best, the _right_ thing to say, wasn't going to be the honest ones.  
说“是”在技术上虽是真话，但也暗示了他会用这个明日香取代她，这是他绝不允许自己做的事。有时候，最好的、正确的话，并不总是最诚实的。

"We didn't kiss, but I have to say…our kiss felt heavenly."  
“我们没有接吻，但我不得不说……我们的吻感觉如天堂般美妙。”

Asuka raised her eyebrows. "Really? Then…" She made a predatory grin that could be labeled as seductive by people who had more experience. Now he was hers, _absolutely_ and _entirely._ "I'm completely yours as well." She purred into his face. "Mine."  
明日香挑了挑眉。“真的吗？那么……”她露出了一个可以被有经验的人称为诱惑的掠食性微笑。现在他是她的了，完全彻底地。“我也完全属于你。”她在他脸上低声呢喃，“我的。”

Asuka smashed her lips on his. This time Shinji could feel something different from their last make-out session. While the former one was hesitant, unfamiliar, even nervous, what he had now was a hungry and devouring kiss. It was Asuka claiming her property, sucking every last little piece of his heart out from his throat.  
明日香猛地吻上了他的唇。这一次，真嗣感受到了与上次亲热时不同的东西。虽然上一次是犹豫、陌生甚至紧张的，但这次是一个饥饿且吞噬一切的吻。这是明日香在宣告她的所有权，从他的喉咙里吸出他心中最后一点碎片。

Time again disappeared for both of them. Both teenagers kept assaulting each other's mouth cavity with their tongues, exchanging their saliva in a battle of tongue dominance. The de-facto lovers stumbled around the room and came to the kitchen area as they drowned in their fantasy worlds.  
时间再次从他们身边流逝。两个少年不停地用舌头攻击对方的口腔，在一场舌尖的较量中交换着唾液。这对实际上的恋人跌跌撞撞地在房间里移动，最终来到了厨房区域，沉浸在他们各自的幻想世界中。

Asuka suddenly spun Shinji around, slamming his back against the dining table while she leaned into the kiss. This felt so good for her to the extent she couldn't care less about the fact that he hadn't brushed his teeth yet. This was what she had been seeking and denied, now that she had it, she wanted it to last as long as possible, if not forever. Fortunately, Shinji had good habits in keeping oral hygienic or it would definitely ruin the mood.  
明日香突然转身将真嗣推向餐桌，将他的背猛地撞在桌面上，同时倾身加深了这个吻。这种感觉对她来说太美好了，以至于她根本不在乎他还没刷牙的事实。这是她一直渴望却未能得到的，现在拥有了，她希望它能持续得越久越好，甚至永远。幸运的是，真嗣保持口腔卫生的好习惯，否则这绝对会破坏气氛。

None of the two knew how long their passionate make-out session had lasted before a sense of time finally registered on Asuka's mind. Gradually the pace slowed down, and the redhead reluctantly pulled away from the kiss. Looking directly into her eyes, Shinji could swear she wasn't going to stop just yet since he noticed the subtle difference in the gleam of her eyes.  
两人都不清楚这段激情的热吻持续了多久，直到时间感终于在明日香心中浮现。渐渐地，节奏放缓，红发少女依依不舍地离开了亲吻。直视着她的眼睛，真嗣敢发誓她不会就此罢休，因为他注意到了她眼中微妙的光芒变化。

Now it had a hint of horniness in it.  
现在，那光芒中多了一丝欲望。

"I command you…to fulfill your first official boyfriend duty," said Asuka after purring into his face.  
“我命令你……履行你作为正式男友的第一个职责，”明日香在他脸上轻声细语地说道。

"So now I'm your boyfriend?" Shinji asked, half-amused, half-joyful.  
“所以现在我是你男朋友了？”真嗣问道，半是打趣半是欣喜。

"If you dare to joke about 'feel bad', I'm gonna kill you," Asuka hissed, though contrasted by the warm, _seductive_ smile she had on her beautiful face.  
"你要是敢拿'感觉不好'开玩笑，我就宰了你，"明日香低声说道，尽管她美丽的脸上挂着温暖而诱人的微笑。

"Then how am I going to keep my promise?" Shinji smirked.  
"那我怎么兑现承诺呢？"真嗣得意地笑了笑。

"Baka-Shinji…" Asuka put a hand on his chest. Acting solely on autopilot, Asuka surrendered the control of her body to hormones. "Now…let me…"  
"笨蛋真嗣……" 明日香将手放在他的胸口。完全出于本能，明日香将身体的控制权交给了荷尔蒙。"现在……让我……"

Shinji tensed up as he saw Asuka started unbuttoning his shirt. He was aware that the redhead preferred to take initiatives, but he wasn't ready for this…yet. Not after-  
看到明日香开始解开他的衬衫扣子，真嗣紧张起来。他知道红发的她喜欢主动出击，但他还没准备好……至少不是在……

He wanted to tell her to stop – they were already going too far. But how much would it hurt her? He needed to make a decision, and fast, considering half of his shirt was already torn apart-  
他想告诉她停下来——他们已经走得太远了。但这会让她有多受伤？他需要迅速做出决定，考虑到他的衬衫已经被撕开了一半——

Kaji Ryoji slid Misato's keycard through the slot on the electronic lock while maintaining a strong hold on the woman mentioned above, keeping her from falling flat on the ground. With a hiss, the door slid open, and Kaji helped his drunk de facto lover into the apartment.  
加持良治将美里提到的钥匙卡插入电子锁的插槽，同时紧紧抓住上面提到的女人，防止她直接摔倒在地。随着一声嘶嘶声，门滑开了，加持扶着醉酒的实际恋人进了公寓。

At the moment, he could hear panicked footsteps running around the apartment and the sound of a door slamming shut. He furrowed his brows and pressed his right hand on his holster carrying a 9mm pistol, before calling out. "Shinji-kun? Asuka? Are you home?"  
此刻，他能听到公寓里慌乱的脚步声和门砰然关闭的声音。他皱起眉头，右手按在携带 9 毫米手枪的枪套上，然后喊道：“真嗣君？明日香？你们在家吗？”

"Ah! Kaji-san! Welcome home!" Came to him Asuka's cheerful voice. Though as a professional spy, he caught hints of nervousness and panic in her tone.  
“啊！加持先生！欢迎回家！”明日香欢快的声音传来。尽管作为职业间谍，他捕捉到了她语气中的紧张和恐慌。

"Hi Asuka, where's Shinji-kun?" Kaji probed as he carried Misato into the living room, where the two teenagers had begun their make-out sessions. Upon seeing the redhead alone in the living room, he continued, "Yo, Asuka. Give me a hand with her and help her get into bed."  
"嗨，明日香，真嗣在哪里？" 加持一边将美里抱进客厅，一边询问，那里正是两个青少年开始亲热的地方。看到红发少女独自在客厅，他继续说道，"哟，明日香。帮我一把，把她扶到床上去。"

"Coming, Kaji-san." Asuka hastily moved to support Misato, holding up her other side where Kaji couldn't.  
"来了，加持先生。" 明日香急忙上前扶住美里，支撑着加持够不到的另一侧。

The triple-spy narrowed his eyes as he seemed to smell a familiar scent, though he couldn't quite put his fingers on it. Shaking the thoughts off, together with Asuka they led the stumbling Misato to her room and laid her down on her bed. Adjusting his clothes, Kaji smiled an appreciative smile and started. "Thanks, Asuka. Well, time for me to go. Goodnight-"  
这位三重间谍眯起眼睛，似乎嗅到了一种熟悉的气味，尽管他无法确切指出是什么。他摇摇头，抛开这些思绪，与明日香一起将踉跄的美里扶到她的房间，并让她躺下。加持整理了一下衣服，露出赞赏的微笑，然后说道："谢谢你，明日香。好了，我该走了。晚安——"

He trailed off as he took a careful look at Asuka's appearance. Her hair was messy, her cheeks were slightly red. Kaji narrowed his eyes a bit further as he set his eyes on her lips. They were a little bit swollen and got minor bruising on them. Kaji blinked as his brain registered the symptom. He had seen people's lips like this before, normally after sucking hard on lollipops. But aside from that…  
他话说到一半，仔细打量起明日香的外表。她的头发凌乱，脸颊微微泛红。加持眯起眼睛，目光落在她的唇上。那双唇略显肿胀，还带着轻微的瘀伤。加持眨了眨眼，大脑开始处理这一迹象。他以前见过类似情况，通常是用力吮吸棒棒糖后的结果。但除此之外……

"Goodnight, Kaji-san. I'm going to bed as well," Asuka smiled an uneasy smile and turned away.  
“晚安，加持先生。我也去睡了。”明日香勉强笑了笑，转身离开。

"Where's Shinji-kun?" Kaji smirked knowingly.  
“真嗣去哪儿了？”加持带着心知肚明的笑意问道。

"Erm, that baka is sleeping in his room, I suppose," the redhead replied, her eyes looking left and right.  
“呃，那个笨蛋大概在他房间里睡觉吧，”红发女孩回答，眼神左右游移。

"Well, I'm heading off," before Asuka could let out a sigh of relief, Kaji continued. "Though before I go…I have a question."  
"嗯，我要走了，"在明日香还没来得及松一口气之前，加持继续说道。"不过在我离开之前……我有个问题。"

"Shoot," said Asuka, wanting to have him disappear as soon as possible so she could continue what they were interrupted from.  
"说吧，"明日香说道，希望他能尽快消失，这样她就可以继续他们被打断的事情了。"

"How does he feel?" Smirking, Kaji winked smugly at the redhead.  
"他感觉如何？" 卡兹得意地对红发女孩眨了眨眼，嘴角挂着一丝狡黠的微笑。

"How does-WHAT?!" Asuka exclaimed in utter surprise. "Wh-what do you mean, Kaji?"  
"感觉什么？！" 明日香惊呼出声，完全出乎意料。"什、什么意思，卡兹？"

"Do I need to spell it out for you?" Kaji said. "His li-"  
"需要我给你详细解释吗？" 卡兹说道。"他的心-"

"ALRIGHT, alright," Asuka shouted, cutting Kaji off. She could only blame her own carelessness – their relationship was exposed just after it started. Blushing an incandescent blush, she started up after taking a deep breath. "Not too bad for a first kiss, I suppose."  
"好了，好了，"明日香大声打断加持。她只能怪自己的粗心大意——他们的关系才刚开始就被曝光了。她满脸通红，深吸一口气后开始说道："第一次接吻，还算不错吧。"

"Well, I'm glad you found someone, Asuka," said Kaji truthfully; his smug smirk turned into a warm smile. "He's really a good guy, you have my word."  
"嗯，我很高兴你找到了人，明日香，" 加持真诚地说道；他那得意的微笑变成了温暖的笑容。"他真的是个好人，我保证。"

"Yeah, and it took me a lot of dancing around to make sure of it…but I'm certain it will be worth it." Smiling, the redhead recalled the fantastic sensation of the kiss. Her face turned nervous as the realization dawned on her. "Please keep this a secret, okay? I don't want Misato to…freak out or something." She found it really irritable that Misato treated them as her shipping project – if their guardian could be more mature than she was, Asuka didn't have to worry about it.  
"是啊，我绕了很多弯路才确定这一点……但我确信这是值得的。" 红发女孩微笑着，回想起那个美妙的吻的感觉。当意识到这一点时，她的脸变得紧张。"请保密，好吗？我不希望美里……发疯或者什么的。" 她觉得美里把他们当作自己的配对项目真的很烦人——如果他们的监护人能更成熟一些，明日香就不用担心了。"

"Well, I think she'll approve of you two going out," Kaji assured. "At least I approve with all fours. We ask you kids to do our adults' job. It's unfair to…snatch the happiness from you when you found it."  
"嗯，我想她会同意你们交往的，" 加持保证道。"至少我举双手双脚赞成。我们让你们这些孩子承担我们成年人的工作。从你们找到幸福时夺走它是不公平的。"

"Thanks, Kaji…" Asuka sighed in relief.  
“谢谢你，加持…” 明日香松了口气叹道。

"Though, you might consider taking things slower." Came to her Kaji's serious voice. "I'm telling you this from my personal experience."  
“不过，你或许该考虑放慢脚步。” 加持严肃的声音传来，“这是我个人经验的忠告。”

"Fine…I will," after a moment of hesitation, Asuka conceded half-heartedly. Even though Kaji didn't spell it out, she knew perfectly well what he was referring to. "See you later, Kaji…"  
“好吧…我会注意的，” 明日香犹豫片刻后半推半就地答应了。尽管加持没有明说，但她完全明白他在指什么。“再见，加持…”

"See ya kiddo." Kaji nodded before turning around and headed off. Closing the apartment door behind him, the ponytailed man let out a relaxed sigh.  
“再见，孩子。” 凯吉点头后转身离开。关上公寓门，这位扎着马尾的男人放松地叹了口气。

Almost taking a father's role of the redhead, he really hoped she could find some happiness inside the madness of Angel Wars. As a spy who walked in the minefield, he knew he couldn't take care of her forever, and she needed someone else to love her, to keep her loneliness away.  
他几乎扮演了一个父亲的角色，真心希望她能在天使战争的疯狂中找到一些幸福。作为一名行走在雷区的间谍，他知道无法永远照顾她，她需要有人去爱她，驱散她的孤独。

Knowing how beautiful and exotic Asuka was, Kaji was almost certain that she would have hordes of boys lined up in front of the door of her home for her date with. But the fact that she never went out with anyone intrigued him – he knew what happened in her childhood from reading her files, but did it have such an impact on her attitude to the extent that she did her best to push everyone away?  
知道明日香有多美丽和异国情调，凯吉几乎可以肯定会有成群的男孩在她家门口排队等她约会。但她从未与任何人出去的事实让他感到好奇——他从她的档案中了解她的童年发生了什么，但这是否对她的态度产生了如此大的影响，以至于她尽全力推开所有人？

Now though, she finally found someone, someone who had earned Kaji's trust. This way, he could devote himself to his work with more effort.  
然而现在，她终于找到了一个人，一个赢得了加持信任的人。这样一来，他可以更加全心全意地投入到工作中。

He winced as the image of another woman emerged from his mind. How would she take it if something happened to him? Kaji sighed. If Asuka and Shinji could find their own happiness, there was still a chance for him, however tiny, that he could seek his own happiness with the woman he loved as well.  
他皱了皱眉，脑海中浮现出另一个女人的影像。如果他出了什么事，她会怎么想？加持叹了口气。如果明日香和真嗣能找到他们自己的幸福，那么他仍有那么一丝微小的机会，去追寻与他所爱的女人共同的幸福。

Dr. Akagi's grin widened once the results of the sync test started to come back in. She could hear Maya chatting idly with other bridge bunnies in the distance, but paid no attention since such activity had become a regular, considering how boring it was to wait for the sync rates to stabilize.  
当同步测试的结果开始陆续返回时，赤木博士的笑容更加灿烂了。她能听到玛雅在远处与其他桥上的工作人员闲聊，但并未在意，因为等待同步率稳定这种无聊的事情已经成了常态。

Though Major Katsuragi had been more quiet than usual.  
尽管葛城美里少校比平时更为沉默。

_"Oh my God…" Misato gasped as she set her eyes on the white giant humanoid, her pistol dropped on the floor. "Is this…Adam?"  
“我的天啊…”美里倒抽一口气，目光落在那白色巨人身上，手中的枪滑落在地。“这是…亚当吗？”_

_"No, this is Lilith, the Second Angel," Kaji Ryoji's expression was unreadable.  
“不，这是莉莉丝，第二使徒，”加持良治的表情难以捉摸。_

_"The…Second Angel? What is NERV doing, keeping an Angel in the basement?! What the hell is going on, Kaji?!"  
"第二使徒？NERV 在地下室里养着一个使徒？！这到底是怎么回事，加持？"_

_"I once didn't know better," Kaji's narrowed his eyes. "From now on, I'll do my best."  
"我曾经不懂事，"" 加持眯起了眼睛。""从今往后，我会尽力的。"_

"Damn, a whole five points of increase over the last time," Ritsuko shook her head in disbelief. Though, complaining was not on the table. Walking to Misato's side, she started upon having her attention. "Asuka's sync rate is skyrocketing. She's even leaving Shinji behind by a few points. I wonder what do you know about it?"  
"该死，比上次整整提高了五分，"" 律子难以置信地摇了摇头。虽然抱怨不在她的选项之内。走到美里身边，她开始引起她的注意。""明日香的同步率正在飙升。她甚至把真嗣甩在了后面。你对此有什么了解吗？"

"What?" Misato's expression was completely clueless. "It's a good thing, isn't it?"  
"什么？" 美里一脸茫然。"这是好事，不是吗？"

"True," the blonde doctor crossed her arms. "But knowing the cause could help me with improving Rei's scores, and also…preventing Asuka from going back down. On second thought, if the cause is unstable, we can take precautions as well."  
"确实，" 金发女医生交叉双臂。"但了解原因能帮助我提高零的分数，同时……防止明日香再次下滑。再想想，如果原因不稳定，我们也可以采取预防措施。"

"Don't look at me as if I know everything," Misato shrugged. "She's been acting perfectly normal at home." She paused for a moment, recalling her charges' behaviors recently. The morning after her hungover on the day of the wedding, the two made breakfast together, a sight she didn't remember seeing ever before. Moreover, Asuka seemed to steal much more glances at Shinji than usual. Sighing, she reiterated. "Well, relatively speaking."  
"别用那种我知道一切的眼神看我，" 美里耸了耸肩。"她在家里表现得完全正常。" 她停顿了一下，回想最近孩子们的行为。宿醉婚礼后的早晨，两人一起做了早餐，这是她以前从未见过的景象。此外，明日香似乎比平时更多地偷看真嗣。她叹了口气，重申道。"嗯，相对而言。"

"I suggest you keep a close eye on them, considering-" She was cut off by an abrupt blaring of alarms. Dr. Akagi hastily rushed over to the monitors. "What's going on?"  
"我建议你密切关注他们，考虑到——" 她的话被突如其来的警报声打断。赤城博士匆忙赶到监视器前。"发生什么事了？"

"Asuka, her plug depth is exceeding 100!" Maya hurried her report.  
"明日香，她的插入栓深度超过 100 了！" 真希急忙报告道。"

"What the hell? Pull her back!" Dr. Akagi exclaimed. As the head of Project E, she knew better than anyone else the danger of staying for too long inside the contamination zone. The physical mutation was one thing, mental pollution was what worried her the most.  
"搞什么鬼？把她拉回来！" 赤城博士惊呼。作为 E 计划的负责人，她比任何人都清楚在污染区内停留过久的危险。身体变异是一回事，精神污染才是她最担心的。

"I can't!" Maya shouted as she furiously typed on her keyboard. "Unit 02 is not responding to our signal!"  
“我做不到！”玛雅大声喊道，她愤怒地在键盘上敲击。“二号机没有响应我们的信号！”

"Cut the power!" “切断电源！”

"Wait! The systems are getting back to normal!" Aoba interjected, at the same time, the alarm subsided as well. "The readings are stabilizing! Plug depth returning to safety zone!"  
“等等！系统正在恢复正常！”青叶插话道，与此同时，警报也逐渐平息。“读数正在稳定！插头深度正在返回安全区域！”

Letting out a huge sigh of relief, Dr. Akagi opened a comm link to Asuka's entry plug. "Asuka? What the hell happened in there?!"  
长长地舒了一口气，赤木律子博士打开了与明日香插入栓的通讯链接。“明日香？里面到底发生了什么？！”

"How am I supposed to know?!" A furious redheaded storm raged across the observation room. "I felt like I was punched in the face! Had your software gone mad or something?!"  
“我怎么知道？！”一头红发的风暴在观察室中怒吼。“我感觉像是被人打了一拳！是你的软件出问题了吗？！”

"Well, at least our pilot looks normal…" Ritsuko rubbed her forehead. "It might be a glitch of the system. I'll investigate the incident after this sync test. End the test now, we don't want…another malfunciton. Oh right," she started up again before the redhead went offline. "Meet me in my office, Asuka."  
“好吧，至少我们的驾驶员看起来正常……”律子揉了揉额头。“可能是系统故障。我会在这次同步测试后调查这个事件。现在结束测试，我们不希望……再次出现故障。哦对了，”她还没等红发女孩下线就又开口了。“来我办公室一趟，明日香。”

"Whatever…" “随便吧…”

The doctor closed her notebook, beginning to make her way down the gray metal hall, her high heels clacking against the metal floor with each step she took. Being a brilliant scientist, she was confident that the system she developed should be flawless, at least always secure. Precautions were taken, safeties were set to ensure unwanted incidents wouldn't happen from their side.  
医生合上笔记本，开始沿着灰色的金属走廊前行，高跟鞋在金属地板上发出清脆的响声。作为一名杰出的科学家，她自信自己开发的系统应该是完美无缺的，至少始终是安全的。她采取了预防措施，设置了安全机制，以确保不会因为他们的失误而发生意外。

Which meant if anything, today's event was caused by the pilot. The only way she knew that could abruptly power up the bond between the EVA and pilot…Ritsuko gasped as the realization struck her. Was she somehow communicating with her mother? That would explain her abnormally high sync rate as well as the sudden dive into the contamination zone. At least that was what she could deduce from the evidence she had.  
这意味着，如果今天的事件有什么原因，那一定是飞行员造成的。她唯一知道的可能突然加强 EVA 与飞行员之间联系的方式……律子倒吸一口凉气，当这个念头击中她时。难道她在以某种方式与她的母亲沟通？这可以解释她异常高的同步率以及突然闯入污染区的行为。至少根据她掌握的证据，这是她能得出的结论。

And the conclusion terrified her.  
而这个结论让她感到恐惧。

She stopped at her door, reaching her finger out to hit a button on the panel next to the automatic door, causing it to open.  
她在门前停下，伸出手指按下旁边自动门面板上的按钮，门随即打开。

Asuka was already in her office waiting, the smell of LCL still fresh on her. "What'd you call me in here for?" She was already starting to sound like her patience was running thin.  
明日香已经在办公室里等候，LCL 的气味还萦绕在她身上。“你叫我进来有什么事？”她已经开始显得有些不耐烦了。

"I want to know what happened during today's sync test," Ritsuko put bluntly. Seeing the inscrutable gaze from the redhead, she tried again. "Let me rephrase that." She started to tap her index finger on her desk. "Today your sync rate was phenomenal. However during the test, you went deep into the contamination zone, which was extremely dangerous. Knowing what happened can help me make sure this won't happen again."  
“我想知道今天同步测试时发生了什么，”律子直截了当地说。看到红发少女那难以捉摸的目光，她尝试换个说法。“让我换个方式说。”她开始用食指轻敲桌面。“今天你的同步率非常惊人。然而在测试中，你深入了污染区，这极其危险。了解发生了什么能帮助我确保这种情况不会再发生。”

Asuka put a finger on her chin and mused. "Well, I was simply meditating on my seat as usual, then…erm, I felt something hit me in the face, and the universe went…boom in front of my eyes." Replied Asuka truthfully, not really knowing what took place herself.  
明日香用手指轻触下巴，沉思着。“嗯，我只是像往常一样坐在座位上冥想，然后…呃，我感觉有什么东西打在了脸上，接着宇宙就在我眼前…砰的一声炸开了。”明日香如实回答，其实她自己也不太清楚发生了什么。

"Do you feel…different? Altered? In any way?" She couldn't tell whether she was lying - or deceiving - but from the looks of her, the part of what she said was at least technically true.  
“你感觉……不一样吗？改变了？在任何方面？”她不确定自己是在撒谎还是欺骗，但从她的表情来看，她所说的一部分至少在技术上是真实的。

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "What? Do you mean I could get…contaminated?" Her voice started gaining a hint of worry and dread.  
明日香挑了挑眉。“什么？你是说我可能会被……污染？”她的声音开始流露出一丝担忧和恐惧。

"Possibly, that's why I'm asking."  
“或许，这就是我提问的原因。”

The redhead gasped, though she regained a semblance of composure soon. "I don't feel particularly different…other than a mild headache."  
红发女孩倒吸一口气，但很快恢复了些许镇定。“我感觉没什么特别的变化……除了轻微的头痛。”

Dr. Akagi sighed. "Well, better safe than sorry…" She tore a piece of paper from her notebook and started writing. "Asuka, follow me to the medical wing. You're required to take a throughout physical and mental examination."  
赤城博士叹了口气。“嗯，安全总比遗憾好……”她从笔记本上撕下一张纸，开始书写。“明日香，跟我去医疗翼。你需要进行一次全面的身心检查。”

"Oh, c'mon! You've got to be kidding me! I…" She trailed off, unable to bring herself to say her plans of the afternoon out loud. Today she and Shinji were supposed to go hunting for a violin for their duet, but since no one else except Kaji knew about their newly established relationship, she intended to keep it secret as long as possible.  
"哦，拜托！你一定是在开玩笑吧！我…" 她话说到一半就停住了，无法将下午的计划大声说出口。今天她和真嗣原本打算去为他们的二重奏找一把小提琴，但由于除了加持之外没有人知道他们新建立的关系，她打算尽可能长时间地保密。

"Huh? Do you have any plans later, Asuka?" Ritsuko asked with a hint of curiosity in her voice.  
"嗯？你今天有什么计划吗，明日香？" 律子带着一丝好奇的语气问道。

Asuka bit down on her lower lip. "Nothing," she conceded. She was sure that Shinji wouldn't mind; after all, she had no way to control what NERV required her to do. Not to mention she was worried about the contamination thing herself.  
明日香咬了咬下唇。“没什么，”她让步道。她确信真嗣不会介意；毕竟，她无法控制 NERV 要求她做的事情。更不用说她自己也担心污染问题。

"Good. Follow me, then." Asuka sighed and accompanied the blonde doctor out of her office and down the hallway. She could only hope the examination wouldn't take too long.  
“好。那就跟我来。”明日香叹了口气，跟着金发医生走出了办公室，沿着走廊前行。她只能希望检查不会花太长时间。

"Tadaima…" The Second Child's sullen voice floated from the entrance way, mixed with soft rustling sounds of her shoes rubbing the floor. "Welcome home!" Came Shinji Ikari's excited voice with a note of worry in it. "Asuka? I received your message. How did the examination go? Is there anything wrong?"  
“ただいま…”第二适格者闷闷不乐的声音从入口处飘来，夹杂着鞋子摩擦地板的轻微沙沙声。“欢迎回家！”真嗣·碇兴奋的声音中带着一丝担忧。“明日香？我收到了你的消息。检查怎么样？有什么问题吗？”

"Nothing, the Doctor said she couldn't find anything wrong…" Asuka sighed in exhaustion. Massaging her waist, she continued, "though it didn't help with me getting utterly wore out…"  
“没什么，博士说她没发现什么问题……”明日香疲惫地叹了口气。她揉着腰继续说：“尽管这并没有让我不那么筋疲力尽……”

"Well, I suppose our duet should wait, then. I'll let you have some rest first." Shinji conceded, his voice certain yet having a tingle of disappointment in it.  
“嗯，那我们的二重奏恐怕得推迟了。我先让你休息一下。”真嗣让步道，他的声音坚定却带着一丝失望的颤抖。

Asuka pouted, "cheer up, Baka! We can do this later! Besides, we didn't get to buy the violin, right? Even if I want to play right now, we can't!"  
明日香撅起嘴，“振作点，笨蛋！我们可以晚点再做！而且，我们还没买到小提琴，对吧？就算我现在想演奏，也没办法！”

"Actually…" Shinji went to 'their room', formerly Asuka's bedroom, and retrieved a new instrument box. "I bought this from the local instruments store after getting your message, I hope you like it." Saying, he opened the box in one swift move.  
"实际上…" 真嗣走向'他们的房间'，也就是以前的明日香卧室，取回了一个新的乐器盒。"收到你的消息后，我从当地乐器店买了这个，希望你会喜欢。" 说着，他利落地打开了盒子。

Raising her eyebrows in surprise, Asuka took a careful examination of the work of art inside it. Even though she had been paying less attention to instruments after her Evangelion training started, she still recognized the well-celebrated craftwork in an instant.  
明日香惊讶地挑了挑眉，仔细端详着盒内的艺术品。尽管自从开始进行 EVA 训练后她对乐器的关注减少了，但她还是立刻认出了这件备受赞誉的工艺品。

It was one of the iconic violins made by a well-known craftsman William Moennig's own hands in the late 1980s. The instrument – or more like an artwork, instead of merely an ordinary tool to produce music – only had a few of its types across the whole world, which in turn led to its soaring price.  
这是由著名工匠威廉·门宁在 1980 年代末亲手制作的一把标志性小提琴。这件乐器——或者更确切地说是一件艺术品，而非仅仅是一种普通的音乐制作工具——在全球范围内仅有少数几把，这也导致了其价格的飙升。

In simple terms, it's impossible for him to get it from some 'local instruments store', and how much did he pay for it…she couldn't even dare start to imagine.  
简而言之，他不可能从某个‘当地乐器店’买到它，而他为此付出了多少……她甚至不敢开始想象。

"Shinji…" the redhead started in a soft voice. "I…thank you. But…I can't accept it."  
“真嗣…”红发女孩轻声开口，“我…谢谢你。但是…我不能接受。”

"Why?" Shinji raised an eyebrow.  
"为什么？" 真嗣挑了挑眉。

"It's too valuable!" Asuka raised her volume. "I can't accept it without feeling bad about it!"  
"这太贵重了！" 明日香提高了音量。"我收下会感到不安的！"

"But I want to give it to you, Asuka," Shinji smiled a reassuring smile. "Your birthday…is getting close, right?" Nodding in confirmation, the redhead couldn't help but let another gleam of surprise leak from her eyes. "Treat this as your birthday gift from me. Besides, I don't have things to do with all the pilot salaries I get other than to make you happy."  
"但我想把它送给你，明日香，" 真嗣露出一个安心的微笑。"你的生日……快到了，对吧？" 红发女孩点头确认，眼中不禁又流露出一丝惊讶的光芒。"就当这是我给你的生日礼物吧。再说，我除了用这些驾驶员薪水让你开心之外，也没别的事可做。"

"But…" Still, she tried. "可是…" 她仍试图推辞。

"You can pay me back when it comes to my birthday, sounds fair?" He had to hide his sad smile when he said it. Birthday? That was something he had never experienced ever since…  
"你可以在我生日时还我，听起来很公平吧？" 他说这话时不得不藏起那抹苦笑。生日？自从那以后，他从未经历过……

Asuka's mouth became a thin line. "Fine." Finally, after a raging battle with herself, the redhead gave in. After all, if he loved her more than anything else in the world, she wasn't going to deny his way of telling her that he loved her.  
明日香的嘴角紧抿成一条线。"好吧。" 经过一番内心的激烈斗争，红发女孩最终妥协了。毕竟，如果他爱她胜过世界上的一切，她也不会拒绝他用这种方式告诉她他爱她。

There was something she could do right now, though. "Still, thank you very much, Shinji." Asuka took the violin case from the boy she fell in love with. With a smile both warm and appreciative, she continued. "This is the best birthday gift I've received so far, no competition. I don't know what I can do to…reciprocate, but I'll try my best! Now, let's start from a duet, shall we?"  
不过，她现在能做些什么。"尽管如此，非常感谢你，真嗣。" 明日香从她爱上的男孩手中接过小提琴盒。带着既温暖又感激的微笑，她继续说道："这是我迄今为止收到的最好的生日礼物，无可比拟。我不知道该如何……回报，但我会尽力的！现在，我们从二重奏开始，好吗？"

"I thought you want some rest first, Asuka," Shinji questioned.  
"我以为你想先休息一下，明日香，" 真嗣问道。

"Not anymore, not after…this," she threw a look at the delicate violin in her hands while caressing the shiny surface of it with utmost care. "So, what are we waiting for?"  
"现在不了，尤其是在……这个之后，" 她瞥了一眼手中的精致小提琴，小心翼翼地抚摸着它光亮的表面。"那么，我们还在等什么呢？"

"As you wish," Shinji grinned in joy and went to get his cello from the closet.  
"如你所愿，" 真嗣带着喜悦的笑容，从衣柜里拿出他的大提琴。

Pulling out another chair from the table, Shinji invited Asuka to sit beside him, so they could see each other's moves clearly. Asuka sat down and readied her instrument, waiting for Shinji to give the signal.  
从桌子上又拉出一把椅子，真嗣邀请明日香坐在他旁边，这样他们可以清楚地看到对方的动作。明日香坐下并准备好她的乐器，等待真嗣发出信号。

"Let's hear what the invincible Shinji-sama could do with his Cello, shall we?" Said Asuka, her voice mixed with amusement and anticipation.  
“让我们听听无敌的真嗣大人用他的大提琴能做什么吧，好吗？”明日香说道，她的声音混合着趣味和期待。

"Right. Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, ready?" "Sure, the famous one. I can accompany you just right!"  
“好的。巴赫的 G 大调第一大提琴组曲，准备好了吗？”“当然，那首著名的曲子。我可以完美地伴奏！”

They looked into each other's eyes for a moment, and nodded simultaneously.  
他们彼此对视了一会儿，然后同时点了点头。

The sound of music flowed through Misato's apartment as Shinji slid the bow across the strings of his cello. The composition was one of the most famous cello music ever made, and fortunately, the redhead could accompany him gracefully with skill.  
音乐在美里公寓中流淌，真嗣用弓在提琴弦上滑动。这首曲子是史上最著名的提琴曲之一，幸运的是，红发女孩能优雅地用技巧与他合奏。

The music carried them as the melody flowed through the duo like a river of sound. It had been quite a while since Asuka had found herself in such a state of ease. She could almost forget about all of the troubles she had been through, all of the hardships she had faced, all of it felt as though it didn't even exist. It was just she and Shinji, her bow, and her violin.  
音乐旋律如声音之河般在两人间流淌。阿斯卡已经很久没有感到如此轻松了。她几乎可以忘记所有经历过的烦恼和困难，一切仿佛都不存在。只有她和真嗣，她的弓，和她的提琴。

After hours of playing, the Children finally pulled to a stop, content smiles on both of their faces. "You played well, Asuka." Shinji complimented, which caused Asuka to blush a little. After all, it was a compliment from someone who was much more proficient in music than her. "What do you expect, Baka-Shinji?" She boasted.  
经过数小时的演奏，孩子们终于停了下来，两人脸上都洋溢着满足的微笑。“你弹得很好，明日香。”真嗣称赞道，这让明日香微微脸红。毕竟，这是来自一个比她更擅长音乐的人的赞美。“你还指望什么，笨蛋真嗣？”她得意地说。

Looking into each other's eyes, both Children smiled and leaned closer to each other.  
两人对视着，孩子们微笑着，彼此靠得更近了。

_Beep…Beep…Beep… 哔…哔…哔…_

"Oh Are you fucking serious?!" Asuka cried, instinctively pulling away from the kiss. She and Shinji's phone started ringing simultaneously, which could only imply one thing. At the moment, they could hear firm knocking sounds from the front door. "Pilot Soryu and Pilot Ikari, NERV Headquarters requires your immediate presence."  
"哦，你他妈是认真的吗？！" 明日香喊道，本能地从那个吻中抽离。她和真嗣的手机同时响起，这只能意味着一件事。此刻，他们能听到前门传来坚定的敲门声。"驾驶员惣流和驾驶员碇，NERV 总部要求你们立即到场。"

"I don't expect anything less…" Shinji sighed.  
"我并不意外……" 真嗣叹息道。

"Well, better get going! I'll let this Angel know how stupid it is, daring to interrupt Asuka Langley Soryu!" Said Asuka with fire in her eyes. It didn't stop her from snatching a quick kiss on the lips from Shinji, though, before they both headed to the front door.  
"好吧，最好快点出发！我要让这个使徒知道，胆敢打断惣流·兰格雷·明日香是多么愚蠢！" 明日香眼中闪着怒火说道。不过，在他们走向前门之前，她还是迅速地吻了真嗣一下。

"What the hell is this?!" Asuka asked incredulously. "A giant 8-Ball?" The monitor in front of her showed the eleventh Angel's stationary form, designated name Leliel. The black and white sphere merely remained unmoving above the city, silence overtaking the entirety of the empty metropolis.  
“这到底是什么鬼东西？！”明日香难以置信地问道，“一个巨大的 8 号球？”她面前的显示屏上显示着第十一使徒的静止形态，代号为雷里尔。这个黑白相间的球体只是静静地悬浮在城市上空，整个空无一人的大都会陷入了沉默。

"It's still Pattern Orange, we don't know if it's an Angel yet," Hyuga said over the comms.  
“目前仍是橙色警戒，我们还不能确定它是使徒，”日向在通讯中说道。

"Well, what else can it be?" Asuka huffed as she stepped behind a fortified building. "Unit 02, in position."  
"还能是什么别的吗？" 明日香哼了一声，躲到一座加固建筑后面。"二号机，就位。"

"Unit 01 in position," Shinji reported, hiding behind another weaponry building. From the communication channel, he could hear reporting in as well, though his attention was not entirely focused on the battle. Leliel - although this time around was the eleventh Angel, and the mysterious disappearance of Ireul still worried him – had always been an 'easy' enemy to deal with, since he didn't really need to do anything aside from sitting inside the entry plug and taking naps and let the events flow naturally.  
"初号机就位，" 真嗣报告道，藏身于另一座军械库建筑后。通讯频道中，他也能听到其他人的报告声，尽管他的注意力并未完全集中在战斗上。雷里尔——尽管这次是第十一使徒，而伊留尔的神秘失踪仍让他忧心忡忡——一直以来都是个'容易'对付的敌人，因为他除了坐在插入栓里打盹，让事件自然发展外，几乎不需要做任何事。

The sound of his radar beeping put an end to his train of thoughts, snapping him back to reality. According to the flashing red dot on his monitor, the Angel is right in front of him, just a few blocks away. He took a deep breath, holding tightly onto his pallet rifle. All he needed to do was fire a round of shots at the black sphere and sank into the shadow. Nonetheless, he was worried about Asuka's reactions. Since they were already together, from past experience he was sure that she would try to save him by any means.  
雷达的哔哔声打断了他的思绪，将他拉回现实。根据监视器上闪烁的红点显示，使徒就在他面前，仅隔几个街区。他深吸一口气，紧紧握住手中的弹匣步枪。他所需要做的只是向黑色球体发射一串子弹，然后潜入阴影中。尽管如此，他还是担心明日香的反应。既然他们已经在一起，根据以往的经验，他确信她会不惜一切代价试图救他。

He simply had to sink faster.  
他只能更快地下沉。

"Alright you three," the Major's voice echoed through their cockpits. "Now, here's the plan; Shinji, you'll provide suppressing fire and gain the Angel's attention. Asuka, with the Angel distracted, you will leap onto it and cut open its exterior. Rei, once its exterior is open, you will take the shot and destroy its core. Understood?"  
"好了，你们三个，" 少校的声音在他们驾驶舱内回响。"现在，计划是这样的；真嗣，你负责提供压制火力并吸引使徒的注意。明日香，在使徒分心时，你跳上去切开它的外壳。绫波，一旦外壳被打开，你就开枪摧毁它的核心。明白了吗？"

"Roger." Their affirmative confirmations came in unison.  
"明白。" 他们齐声确认道。"

"Whenever you're ready, Shinji."  
"随时准备好了，真嗣。"

The said boy peeked his head out around the corner again and could see the sphere slowly looming his way. Raising his rifle before Unit 01's eyes, he took aim and fired.  
那男孩再次从角落探出头来，可以看到那个球体正缓缓向他逼近。他举起手中的步枪，对准了 01 号机，随即开火。

The muzzle flashed, and a round of high-explosive shells flew toward the sphere at supersonic speeds. Before they could hit the target, though, the orb-like Angel abruptly and completely vanished from sight as the HE rounds carried off into the blue sky.  
枪口闪烁着火光，一排高爆弹以超音速射向球体。然而，就在它们即将击中目标之前，那个球状使徒突然完全消失在视野中，高爆弹则继续飞向蔚蓝的天空。

"Pattern Blue! Directly beneath Unit 02!"  
"蓝色模式！就在 02 号机正下方！"

"Asuka, get the hell out of there!"  
"明日香，快离开那里！"

Shinji blinked in shock. His plan had never failed before. Leliel would always go after the Unit which took the shot.  
真嗣震惊地眨了眨眼。他的计划从未失败过。雷利尔总是会追击开枪的那台机体。

Combat reflex was one thing the redhead had always taken pride in herself. Instantly leaping into the air just as the shadow spread out below her feet, Unit 02 reached the roof of a 100 meters-high armored building. "What was that?! A shadow?" She exclaimed.  
战斗直觉是这位红发少女一直引以为傲的能力。就在阴影在她脚下蔓延开来的瞬间，02 号机一跃而起，到达了一座 100 米高的装甲建筑屋顶。“那是什么？！影子吗？”她惊呼道。

Then the building itself started sinking as well. The Second Child shrieked and jumped away once again, putting her past skills of playing hopscotch into use. Shinji Ikari watched the whole scene with a madly beating heart, firing more shots into the shadow and the sphere that was chasing the crimson EVA Unit down like cat catching mouse.  
随后，建筑物本身也开始下沉。第二适格者尖叫一声，再次跳开，将她过去玩跳房子游戏的技巧运用了起来。碇真嗣目睹了整个场景，心跳疯狂加速，向那阴影和追逐着赤红 EVA 单位的球体发射更多子弹，宛如猫捉老鼠一般。

"Ahhh! Stop chasing me you sick fuck!" Asuka jumped from building to building, rooftop to rooftop, trying to get away from the stalking Angel. Though to no avail since the Angel seemed _interested_ in her exclusively, ignoring all other disturbances.  
“啊！别追我了，你这个变态！”明日香从一栋楼跳到另一栋楼，从屋顶跳到屋顶，试图摆脱那只紧追不舍的天使。然而一切都是徒劳，因为天使似乎只对她感兴趣，无视了所有其他干扰。

Finally Unit 02 reached the outer perimeter of the city where most of the buildings were considerably shorter. The next building she'd been counting on as a landing spot was already sunken below the shadow. Unit 02's foot came down where the building should've been, and met nothing.  
最终，初号机 02 抵达了城市的外围，那里大部分建筑都明显低矮了许多。她原本指望的下一个落脚点已经沉没在阴影之下。初号机 02 的一脚落下，本该是建筑的地方却空无一物。

"I…I can't feel my leg!" Asuka's panicked voice came to Shinji from the speakers, tugging his heart. "Shinji, help me! I can't pull out!"  
“我……我感觉不到我的腿了！”明日香惊慌的声音从扬声器中传来，牵动着真嗣的心。“真嗣，帮帮我！我拔不出来！”

"Damn it, eject the entry plug!" Misato quickly delivered the order.  
“该死，弹出插入栓！”美里迅速下达了命令。

"I can't! Unit 02 is not receiving the signal!" Maya reported.  
"不行！02 号机没有接收到信号！" 真希波报告道。

"Shit! Shinji, Rei, rescue Unit 02!"  
"该死！真嗣，丽，快去救 02 号机！"

"I'm on it! Hold on, Asuka!" Shinji shouted into the microphone, willing his EVA to move faster. Unit 01 leaped from the building it had initially taken a position at and dug its axe into the construction closest to Unit 02, causing the EVA to slide down the side of the structure, leaving a large gash in the armored frame of the building.  
"我来了！坚持住，明日香！" 真嗣对着麦克风大喊，催促着自己的 EVA 加速前进。01 号机从最初占据的大楼上一跃而下，将斧头劈入离 02 号机最近的建筑，导致 EVA 沿着建筑外墙滑下，在建筑的装甲框架上留下了一道深深的划痕。

Extending its free hand, Unit 01 reached down to the crimson EVA and tried to take hold of it. "I've got you Asuka!" Having a firm grip on Unit 02's hand, Shinji mustered all of his strength and pulled. The coldness encircling the redhead's body began to leave as she was lifted up to the surface.  
零一单位伸出空着的手，向下探向赤红的 EVA，试图抓住它。“我抓住你了，明日香！”碇真嗣紧紧握住零二单位的手，使出全身力气拉扯。环绕着红发少女的寒冷开始消散，她被拉上了水面。

"Thanks…Baka-Shinji." Grinning, Asuka let out a relieved sigh. "I'll think of-"  
"谢谢…笨蛋真嗣。" 阿斯卡笑着松了口气。"我会考虑-"

Before she could finish her sentence, the building both EVA Units had used as support began sinking as well. The sudden jarring motion was enough to let Unit 01's grip loosen, and Unit 02's fingers slipped between his.  
在她能说完之前，两台 EVA 作为支撑的建筑也开始下沉。突如其来的震动足以让 01 号机的抓握松动，02 号机的手指滑入了他的指间。

"Ahhh! Shinji! Don't let me g-" There wasn't enough time for Asuka to finish her pleading before her entire EVA fell back first into the sea of shadow, disappearing in an instant.  
"啊！真嗣！别让我掉下-" 阿斯卡还没来得及说完她的恳求，她的 EVA 就整个向后倒入了阴影之海，瞬间消失无踪。

"Shinji…retreat." Came Major Katsuragi's resigned voice.  
"真嗣…撤退。" 葛城美里少校无奈的声音传来。

"I'm going after her." "我要去找她。"

Misato felt a chill ran down her spine as she heard the freezingly cold voice of Shinji. Regaining her composure after taking a deep breath, she continued. "Just fall back and regroup! We'll get her out, I promise."  
听到真嗣冰冷彻骨的声音，美里感到脊背一阵发凉。深吸一口气恢复镇定后，她继续说道："先撤退重新集结！我们会把她救出来的，我保证。"

He wasn't going to listen, though. Letting go of his grip on the axe, Unit 01 started promptly falling down toward the bottomless darkness as well.  
但他并不打算听从。松开握住斧头的手，初号机也开始迅速坠向那无底的黑暗之中。

And then hit the ground.  
然后重重地摔在地上。

The Angel moved its shadow away from the spot just before he could reach it. "Damn it!" Shinji punched the controls of his EVA. He did his best trying to distract the Angel and it never worked, and it was his fault Asuka was sucked into the sea of Dirac.  
天使在最后一刻移开了它的阴影，避开了他的攻击。“该死！”真嗣猛击 EVA 的控制台。他尽力试图分散天使的注意力，但从未奏效，而这一切都是他的错，因为明日香被卷入了狄拉克之海。

"Fall back… that's an order."  
"撤退…这是命令。"

Asuka let out a defeated exhale of LCL as another attempt of using the radar to seek help failed just like what she expected. Nothing but nothingness surrounded her and her EVA.  
明日香发出一声挫败的 LCL 叹息，又一次尝试使用雷达寻求帮助，结果正如她所料，失败了。她和她 EVA 的周围，除了虚无，别无他物。

It was at that time she could start to get a grasp on the concept of being blind. After turning off all of the unnecessary systems to conserve power, without a light source, complete darkness engulfed her, save for the dim light coming from the ticking stopwatch on her wrist.  
就在那时，她开始能够理解失明的概念。在关闭了所有不必要的系统以节省电力后，没有光源，除了手腕上滴答作响的秒表发出的微弱光芒外，她完全被黑暗吞噬了。

Right. The stopwatch. Twelve hours had already passed since she fell into this bottomless pit. Having just woken up from a shallow nap, Asuka felt positively dizzy as she suffered from symptoms of spatial disorientation.  
对了，秒表。自从她坠入这个无底洞已经过去了十二个小时。刚刚从浅睡中醒来，明日香感到头晕目眩，遭受着空间定向障碍的症状。

"Shinji…I need you…" She tried to relive the memory of their duet session and other happy times they spent together. It helped to distract her from worrying too much about her current condition, though it didn't help with the fact that she had no idea of how to escape.  
“真嗣…我需要你…”她试图重温他们二重奏的记忆和其他一起度过的快乐时光。这有助于让她不再过多担心当前的状况，尽管这并没有帮助她解决不知道如何逃脱的事实。

"Are you fucking _serious?!_"  
"你他妈是认真的吗？！"

Ritsuko kept her calm composure even though the Misato supernova exploded right in front of her. "It's the only way we've got. Dropping all our remaining N2 mines on the center of the shadow while both of our remaining EVAs will activate their AT-Fields. The concentrated energy will be able to disrupt the imaginary space and destroy it."  
尽管眼前的美里如同超新星般爆发，律子依然保持着冷静。“这是我们唯一的方法。将所有剩余的 N2 地雷集中投放在阴影中心，同时我们剩下的两台 EVA 将激活它们的 AT 力场。集中的能量将能够扰乱虚数空间并将其摧毁。”

"There's no way Unit 02 can withstand that kind of impact! How are we gonna-" She trailed off as the realization dawned on her. "This is not a rescue mission, is it?"  
"二号机不可能承受那种冲击！我们怎么可能——"她话音渐弱，随即恍然大悟。"这不是一次救援任务，对吧？"

Ritsuko shook her head. "The possibility of Unit 02 surviving the blast is somewhere around zero point zero two three percent according to the MAGI. Defeating the Angel is our top priority," she fixed a gaze at the operations director of NERV. "I thought you should be on board with that, Major. The pilot's life is no concern under the current situation."  
律子摇了摇头。“根据 MAGI 的计算，02 号机在爆炸中幸存的可能性大约是零点零二三百分。击败天使是我们的首要任务，”她凝视着 NERV 的作战主任。“我认为你应该同意这一点，少校。在当前情况下，飞行员的生死无关紧要。”

_SLAP_

Misato could feel her hand stinging as the blonde doctor bent over, messaging her red cheek. "It's your responsibility if the pilot dies, Major! Just remember that!" Ritsuko shouted with venom in her voice, a sharp contrast from her usual calm composure. "I'm taking command of this operation." Saying, she started walking away, dialing the number of the commanding officer of the JSSDF strategic bomber squadron, leaving the Major of NERV to stand under the intense floodlight by herself.  
美里感觉到自己的手在刺痛，金发的医生弯下腰，轻揉着她发红的脸颊。“如果驾驶员死了，那是你的责任，少校！记住这一点！”律子带着毒辣的语气喊道，与她平时的冷静沉着形成鲜明对比。“我将接管这次行动。”说完，她开始走开，拨打了战略轰炸机中队 JSSDF 指挥官的电话，留下 NERV 的少校独自站在强烈的泛光灯下。

The pilot of Unit 02 pried her eyes open again. She could feel her eyelids grow heavier with each passing second. "Is this…blood?" Normally the LCL, though carried a hint of coppery smell with it, was filtered enough to make the scent almost unnoticeable. Now the filters were giving away, causing the LCL to break down, producing an uncanny smell.  
02 号机驾驶员再次睁开眼睛。她能感觉到自己的眼皮每秒钟都变得更加沉重。“这是……血吗？”通常情况下，LCL 虽然带有一丝铜腥味，但经过过滤后几乎闻不到。现在过滤器正在失效，导致 LCL 分解，产生了一种诡异的气味。

"I've only got one minute left…" Breathing was getting harder and harder as the LCL around her reached its last cycle before becoming completely drained of oxygen. "So…is this how it ends?" She found that she wasn't afraid of death at this point, at least not the worst worry. She wasn't scared of her life ending as much as at the beginning, but she was afraid of thinking about what she'd be leaving behind if she were to die here.  
“我只剩下最后一分钟了……”随着周围的 LCL 即将完成最后一个循环，氧气完全耗尽，呼吸变得越来越困难。“所以……这就是结局吗？”她发现自己此刻并不害怕死亡，至少不是最糟糕的担忧。她不像最初那样害怕生命的终结，但她害怕思考如果在这里死去，她将留下什么。

Shinji had said she was the only one anchoring him to reality. If she's gone, what would he do?  
碇君曾说过她是唯一将他固定在现实的人。如果她不在了，他会怎么做？

"I'm sorry, Shinji…" She had so many things she wanted to say to him, that she loved him as well, that she wanted him to be with her forever. Asuka watched the faint red light on her plugsuit's wrist faded and died out with a sad smile. She couldn't tell if she was crying or not since tears were dissolved into LCL the instant they came out. "So…rry…Shin…"  
“对不起，碇君……”她有那么多话想对他说，她爱他，她希望他永远和她在一起。明日香看着插座服手腕上微弱的红色灯光渐渐熄灭，带着悲伤的微笑。她无法确定自己是否在哭泣，因为泪水一出来就溶解在 LCL 中了。“对……不起……碇……”

Then it all went black.  
然后一切陷入了黑暗。

"I said it's an order, follow it." Gendo Ikari gazed at the blonde doctor intensely, making the latter person shiver under pressure. "Under no condition are Unit 02 and the Second Child expandable."  
"我说了这是命令，执行它。" 碇源堂凝视着金发医生，目光锐利，让后者在压力下颤抖。"在任何情况下，二号机和第二适格者都不可牺牲。"

"But her batteries will be out of power right now anyway!" Dr. Akagi tried once more. "We have to try something before this Angel does worse!"  
"但她的电池现在肯定已经耗尽了！" 赤木律子再次尝试。"我们必须在使徒造成更大破坏之前采取行动！"

"Irrelevant." Commander Ikari huffed. Shinji had told him that in the end, Kyoko would definitely save her daughter, just like she had done several times before. All they needed to do was to wait. "Rescuing the pilot of Unit 02 is our top priority, I think I made it clear already."  
"无关紧要。" 碇司令哼了一声。真嗣曾告诉他，最终恭子肯定会像之前几次那样救出她的女儿。他们只需等待。"救援二号机驾驶员是我们的首要任务，我想我已经说得很清楚了。"

"But-" "但——"

"Follow the order, Dr. Akagi," Gendo lowered his voice by a few more degrees, if that was even possible.  
"执行命令，赤木博士，" 源度又压低了几分声音，如果这还有可能的话。"

Shinji Ikari watched the whole scene from his father's usual observation spot in his office with satisfaction and amusement. Commander Ikari's innate ability to intimidate people was finally put into good use. Even though he knew Asuka would be fine since her mother had saved her before, it would reveal the truth of her EVA to her, and he wasn't sure what of an impact it would introduce.  
真嗣·碇从父亲办公室里他常待的观察点，带着满意和戏谑的心情观看着整个场面。碇司令天生的威慑力终于得到了有效利用。尽管他知道明日香会没事，因为她母亲之前救过她，但这会揭示她 EVA 的真相，他不确定这会带来什么影响。

Going after her into the Angel would solve the problem since he could just ask her mother for help before Kyoko was needed.  
跟着她进入天使号就能解决问题，因为他可以在需要久子之前先向她的母亲求助。

A glance at the watch told him only one minute remained before Unit 02 would break out of the Angel. Nonetheless, nervousness still made his stomach clench.  
瞥一眼手表，他得知距离 02 号机突破使徒仅剩一分钟。然而，紧张感依旧让他的胃紧缩起来。

_Time Remaining: 00:00:30 剩余时间：00:00:30_

_Time Remaining: 00:00:29 剩余时间：00:00:29_

Shinji took a deep breath. It's happening at any moment.  
真嗣深吸了一口气。随时都可能发生。

_Time Remaining: 00:00:00 剩余时间：00:00:00_

_Beep_

_Time Remaining: -00:00:01  
剩余时间：-00:00:01_

Shinji frowned. Did he set his timer too early? A quick check at the log told him he even set the timer 5 minutes longer than the maximum time an EVA could operate under emergency mode.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。难道他设定的计时器太早了？他迅速查看了一下日志，发现他甚至将计时器设定得比 EVA 在紧急模式下能运行的最长时间还要多出 5 分钟。

Then why? 那为什么？

_Help her…Mrs. Soryu… 救救她……惣流女士……_

_Time Remaining: -00:00:59  
剩余时间：-00:00:59_

_Time Remaining: -00:01:00  
剩余时间：-00:01:00_

Cold sweat started dripping from Shinji's body. Chatters from people on the command deck began turning blurry.  
冷汗开始从真嗣的身体上滴落。指挥舱内人们的交谈声逐渐变得模糊。

"Asuka…where are you?" His gaze at the Angel intensified as time passed.  
“明日香…你在哪儿？”随着时间流逝，他对使徒的注视愈发强烈。

_Time Remaining: -00:02:04  
剩余时间：-00:02:04_

_Time Remaining: -00:02:05  
剩余时间：-00:02:05_

"Help her…" Where was she? "What are you waiting for, Mrs. Soryu? HELP HER!"  
“救她…”她在哪儿？“你们还在等什么，惣流女士？救她啊！”

Shinji's hands started to tremble.  
真嗣的双手开始颤抖。

"Please…help her…" He mumbled, his voice breaking down. "Mrs. Soryu…help your daughter!"  
“请…救救她…”他喃喃道，声音哽咽。“惣流女士…救救您的女儿！”

_Time Remaining: -00:04:26  
剩余时间：-00:04:26_

_Time Remaining: -00:04:27

Shinji fell to his knees and slammed his fist on the floor.  
真嗣跪倒在地，一拳砸在地板上。

"Kyoko…please help her…" _'No...this is not happening...Asuka!'_ "Please…"  
“响子…请帮帮她…”‘不...这不是真的...明日香！’“请…”

The eleventh Angel hovered above the city unperturbed without the slightest sighs of moving, its colossal shadow loomed over the earth.  
第十一个使徒悬浮在城市上空，毫不动摇，没有一丝移动的迹象，它的巨大阴影笼罩着大地。

*第 24 章*: 第 24 章：虚假

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

**Chapter 24: Falsity 第二十四章：虚伪**

After opening her eyes, the first thing she saw was the indiscernible landscape of the countryside across a large window. The train car swayed as it clattered along the railway, orange sunlight peeking through the glass and splashing over her body.  
睁开眼后，映入她眼帘的第一幕便是透过一扇大窗难以辨认的乡间景色。火车车厢随着铁轨的咔嗒声摇晃，橙色的阳光透过玻璃洒落在她身上。

_'Am I…dead?'_ was the first coherent thought Asuka made after her consciousness returned. The last thing she could remember was watching the timer countdown to zero. Surrendering to reality without fighting didn't exist in her dictionary, she would rather die than…well, she probably already did…  
‘我……死了吗？’这是明日香恢复意识后的第一个清晰念头。她最后记得的是看着计时器归零。在她的字典里，放弃抵抗屈服于现实是不存在的，她宁愿死也不愿……好吧，她可能已经……

The redhead gasped as she set her eyes on her sole companion in the train carriage – she couldn't make out her face clearly, but the unmistakable red A-10 clips standing on her head said louder than any words of her identity.  
红发女孩倒抽一口气，目光落在车厢内唯一的同伴身上——她的面容模糊不清，但那头顶上显眼的红色 A-10 发夹比任何言语都更能表明她的身份。

"Who…are you?" She asked, her voice slightly shaking.  
"你……是谁？" 她问道，声音微微颤抖。

"I am Asuka Langley Soryu." The figure intoned.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。" 那身影低沉地说道。

"I am myself, not you!" Asuka barked at the other redhead, jumping up from her seat. "Stop using my face already!"  
"我就是我，不是你！" 明日香对另一个红发女子厉声说道，从座位上跳了起来。"别再用我的脸了！"

"I am more of you than you could possibly imagine," the faux redhead replied calmly, seemingly undisturbed by Asuka's attitude. "I want to understand you. Help me understand!"  
"我比你所能想象的更像你，"这位假红发女子平静地回答，似乎并未被明日香的态度所动摇。"我想了解你。帮我了解吧！"

"I don't want you to understand me! I already have someone who understands me!" Asuka cried, the image of Shinji emerging in her mind.  
"我不需要你了解我！我已经有人懂我了！"明日香哭喊着，脑海中浮现出真嗣的形象。

"Oh?" The other Asuka's voice gained a note of curiosity. "Who is it?"  
"哦？" 另一个明日香的语气中增添了一丝好奇。"是谁呢？"

"It's none of your business!" Asuka screamed.  
"这不关你的事！" 明日香尖叫道。

"So, I see you have chosen this path of life." The other redhead morphed into a school-uniform-wearing Asuka in an eyeblink. "This is Asuka Langley Soryu right now."  
"看来，你选择了这条人生道路。" 另一个红发女孩眨眼间变成了穿着校服的明日香。"这就是现在的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

Asuka crossed her arms together in front of her chest but made no verbal comments.  
明日香双臂交叉于胸前，却未发一言。

Slowly, the pseudo-Asuka started growing up at visible speeds. Her hair grew longer, her height grew taller, and her feminine figures started filling up as well. Then, at one moment, the red A-10 hair clips disappeared, leaving her long golden-red mane flow down from her head to her waist like a brilliant waterfall.  
渐渐地，那个假明日香开始以肉眼可见的速度成长。她的头发变长，身高增长，女性曲线也逐渐显现。随后，在某一刻，红色的 A-10 发夹消失了，一头金红色的长发如绚烂瀑布般从头顶倾泻至腰际。

"So?" Asuka snorted, though she had to admit older version of herself looked breathtaking.  
“所以呢？”明日香哼了一声，尽管她不得不承认，这个年长版的自己美得令人窒息。

"Being together with him unavoidably leads to this." A voice rang in her head. "At the cost of losing your status as an EVA pilot. Is this what you want?"  
"和他在一起，这不可避免地会发生。"一个声音在她脑海中响起。"以失去 EVA 驾驶员身份为代价。这是你想要的吗？"

Asuka bit down on her lower lips. Not long ago, she wouldn't even hesitate to answer negatively. Piloting an EVA was her life's purpose, or at least she thought so. But right now, she understood that through EVA, all she craved was attention and love - which Shinji could provide. If she had already got what she wanted from piloting EVA, the main reason she kept piloting was out of a sense of duty as well as not wanting to leave Shinji alone fighting the Angels. "If I really have to make that choice...I would choose him."  
明日香咬紧了下唇。不久前，她会毫不犹豫地给出否定答案。驾驶 EVA 曾是她生命的意义，至少她是这么认为的。但现在，她明白通过 EVA，她所渴望的不过是关注和爱——而真嗣能给予这些。如果她已经从驾驶 EVA 中得到了想要的东西，她继续驾驶的主要原因是一种责任感，以及不想让真嗣独自对抗使徒。“如果我真的必须做出选择……我会选择他。”

The pseudo-Asuka started reforming again. Besides getting older and taller, this time, a shiny silver object appeared on her left hand's ring finger. Frowning, Asuka walked closer and took a careful look at the object.  
伪明日香开始再次重组。除了变得更年长和更高之外，这次，她左手无名指上出现了一个闪亮的银色物体。明日香皱起眉头，走近仔细观察那个物体。

It was a wedding ring with 'I. S.' imprinted on it.  
那是一枚刻有‘I. S.’字样的结婚戒指。

"Is this what you want? To be dependent on someone else? You've always wanted to be alone."  
"这就是你想要的吗？依赖别人？你一直想独自一人。"

"I don't want to be alone!" Though she couldn't help but smile a bit at the image. Marriage sounded scary to her. Still, she found no reasons against it, especially if it was with Shinji.  
"我不想独自一人！" 尽管她忍不住对这个形象微微一笑。婚姻对她来说听起来很可怕。尽管如此，她找不到反对的理由，尤其是如果对象是真嗣的话。

"Hm." The voice sounded almost disappointed. Asuka watched intently at the adult version of herself, furrowing her brows as she seemed to catch no apparent changes to the image. Though that was changed very quickly as she noticed even though her face remained the same, her belly was undoubtedly becoming round.  
"嗯。" 那声音听起来几乎有些失望。明日香专注地看着成年版的自己，皱起眉头，似乎没有察觉到形象有明显的变化。不过很快她就注意到，虽然她的脸保持不变，但她的腹部无疑在变圆。

"You've always hated having kids, are you not? Under such a situation, do you still want to take this life path?"  
"你一直不喜欢有孩子，不是吗？在这种情况下，你还想走这条路吗？"

Raising kids. Asuka's eyes widened at the very thought. Truthfully she was indeed scared, _intimidated_ by the idea. She feared she would only follow her mother's example. But what would Shinji want? "I don't know…but as long as he is with me, I can handle everything!"  
养育孩子。想到这一点，明日香的眼中闪过一丝惊慌。说实话，她的确感到害怕，被这个想法所震慑。她担心自己只会重蹈母亲的覆辙。但真嗣会怎么想呢？“我不知道……但只要有他在我身边，我就能应对一切！”

"Stubborn poor little creature…" The image transformed again. This time the figure grew up much faster than before. Asuka saw herself went through adulthood, middle age, and finally – an elder Asuka sitting in a wheelchair. Her red hair that she took proud in faded in color, though she could still clearly make out her face. "Is this what you really want? Spend your whole life with him?"  
"固执的小可怜……" 影像再次变换。这一次，身影比之前成长得更快。明日香看到自己经历了成年、中年，最终——一个坐在轮椅上的老年明日香。她引以为傲的红发褪去了颜色，尽管她仍能清晰地辨认出自己的面容。“这就是你真正想要的吗？与他共度一生？”

Asuka nodded without so much as peradventure. "I think I do…I finally found someone who loves me and understands me… I'm not letting him go!"  
明日香毫不犹豫地点头。“我想我确实…我终于找到了一个爱我并理解我的人…我不会让他离开的！”

"If that's the case…" Asuka's eyes went wide as the elder version of herself morphed into a boy she fell in love with. "Stay with me forever…Asuka."  
“如果是这样的话…”明日香的眼睛睁得大大的，看着年长的自己变成了她所爱的那个男孩。“永远和我在一起…明日香。”

Gendo Ikari stood silently behind his son, who was currently standing beside the railings and staring a death glare at the stationary form of the eleventh Angel, folding his hands together behind his rear. "Shinji…" He started, unsure of what to say.  
碇源堂默默地站在他儿子身后，儿子正站在栏杆旁，对第十一使徒的静止形态投以死亡凝视，双手交叉在背后。“真嗣…”他开口道，不确定该说什么。

"It's not your fault." The boy muttered, his eyes lifeless. Did he just break his record of how fast he could get Asuka killed? "It's my fault. I should've been the one sucked in there, not her."  
"这不是你的错。" 男孩喃喃道，眼神空洞。他是不是刚刚打破了让明日香最快死去的记录？"是我的错。我本该是被吸进去的那个人，而不是她。"

"What now?" Gendo probed cautiously. Still remembering Shinji's response of 'losing the Second Child,' he couldn't help but feel nervous about his son's mental state. Though he was half-certain that he had no way to end the world without Unit 01, and seeing him having no intention to get to the EVA whatsoever, Gendo didn't want to be the first one of them to turn against each other.  
"现在怎么办？" 碇源堂小心翼翼地试探。他仍然记得真嗣对“失去二号机驾驶员”的反应，不禁对他的儿子的心理状态感到紧张。虽然他半信半疑地认为没有初号机就无法结束世界，而且看到真嗣完全没有接近 EVA 的意图，碇源堂不想成为他们中第一个反目的人。

Not after sharing all those things with him…  
在他分享了所有那些事情之后……

He could've called Section 2 to restrain him, or even put him in jail. But without him piloting Unit 01, he stood no chance of winning against SEELE. Not to mention they still had more Angels incoming, and he was almost certain Unit 00 alone would be insufficient in defeating them.  
他本可以叫第二支部来制服他，甚至把他关进监狱。但没有他驾驶 01 号机，他根本没有机会战胜 SEELE。更不用说还有更多的使徒即将来袭，他几乎可以肯定仅凭 00 号机是无法击败它们的。

"She can't be dead. I don't believe it. Mrs. Soryu won't let her die like this." So mumbled Shinji, half to convince himself. He had absolutely zero idea of what would happen if the battery entirely runs out while inside Leliel – this had never happened before. "I still have hope."  
"她不可能死了。我不相信。碇司令不会让她就这样死去的。"真嗣喃喃自语，一半是为了说服自己。他完全不知道如果电池完全耗尽时还待在雷里尔内部会发生什么——这种情况从未发生过。"我还有希望。"

Gendo Ikari threw a look at the orb-shaped Angel, a slight frown crossed his face. If his son hadn't given up yet, there was no reason for him to lose hope as well. "Is there anything we can do? From outside?"  
碇源堂瞥了一眼球形的使徒，眉头微微皱起。既然他的儿子还未放弃，他也没有理由失去希望。“我们能从外部做些什么吗？”

"I don't know." Replied Shinji truthfully in a sullen voice. "I don't know…"  
"我不知道。" 真嗣用闷闷不乐的声音如实回答。"我不知道……"

What could he do? For some unspoken reason he didn't know, the Angel kept avoiding him from entering the shadow. As much as he didn't want to admit it, throwing all of the remaining 992 N2 mines was actually the best shot they got right now.  
他能做什么呢？出于某种未言明的原因，他不知道为什么使徒一直避开他进入阴影。尽管他不想承认，但投掷所有剩余的 992 枚 N2 地雷实际上是他们目前最好的机会。

Shinji sighed as he turned away from the spot. "Shinji-kun?" A familiar voice came to him, snapping his head in the direction. "Rei?" He was faintly surprised that Rei came to find him in his father's office, but shook it off since he recalled she was also a frequent visitor of this place.  
真嗣叹了口气，转身离开那个地方。"真嗣君？"一个熟悉的声音传来，他猛地转头望向声音的方向。"绫波？"他有些惊讶绫波会来他父亲的办公室找他，但随即想起她也是这里的常客，便不再多想。

"You shouldn't blame yourself." Rei's voice, although monotone as usual, carried a note of concern in it. "She wouldn't blame you."  
“你不应该责怪自己。”绫波的声音一如既往地平淡，却带着一丝关切。“她不会怪你的。”

"You don't understand, Rei," Shinji let out a sorrowful chuckle. Of course Ayanami didn't understand. She didn't even know the tip of the iceberg. "None of this should've happened…"  
“你不明白，绫波，”真嗣发出一声苦笑。当然，绫波是不会理解的。她连冰山一角都不了解。“这一切本不该发生……”

"I do not believe Asuka would want to see you like this." Ayanami kept her eyes locked with Shinji's, her crimson eyes meeting his cobalt.  
"我不认为明日香会希望看到你这样。" 绫波保持着与真嗣的目光对视，她的赤红眼眸迎上了他的钴蓝。

"Rei…" Shinji spoke softly. "You weren't there… I'm the one who couldn't save her…I had her in my hands, damn it!"  
"绫波…" 真嗣轻声说道。"你不在那里…是我没能救她…我曾握着她的手，该死！"

"But you tried." Ayanami kept going. "That's what matters."  
"但你尝试了。" 绫波继续说道。"这才是最重要的。"

The First Child could hear him snicker. "Rei…You either succeed, or you fail. It doesn't matter if you try. It's the end result that matters." He shook his head, though she couldn't see it.  
第一适格者能听到他在窃笑。“丽……你不是成功，就是失败。尝试与否并不重要。重要的是结果。”他摇了摇头，尽管她看不见。

"I do not think so. As long as you try, then there's nothing you should be sorry for."  
“我不这么认为。只要你尝试了，就没有什么需要后悔的。”

Shinji shook his head and sneered. Oh he had been trying. He had been trying so hard for so long to the extent he couldn't even remember where it all started from. The red beach was the last place he saw her.  
真嗣摇了摇头，冷笑一声。哦，他一直在尝试。他努力了那么久，久到连一切开始的地方都记不清了。他最后一次见到她是在红海滩。

"If your roles were reversed, would you have blamed her? If she failed to save you, would you think of it as her fault?"  
"如果角色互换，你会怪她吗？如果她没能救你，你会认为是她的错吗？"

Shinji could feel his eyes go wide at her question. He looked down at his black leather school shoes, contemplating his response. Chuckling, he started. "Well, of course not…"  
真嗣听到她的问题，眼睛不由得睁大了。他低头看着自己黑色的皮鞋，思考着如何回答。轻笑一声，他开口道："“当然不会……”"

"Then I suppose we've reached a mutual understanding."  
"那么我想我们已经达成了共识。"

The state of an argument short when arguing with Ayanami was something Shinji had a hard time dealing with. Perhaps her straightforwardness and impeccable reasoning were indeed inherited from another planet.  
与绫波争论时总是很快陷入僵局，这让真嗣难以应对。或许她的直率和无可挑剔的逻辑，确实是从另一个星球继承而来的。

Still, it didn't help with the fact that Asuka was not coming back.  
尽管如此，这并不能改变明日香还未回来的事实。

Or was she? 还是说她并非如此？

"Could the Lance of Longinus help?"  
“朗基努斯之枪能帮上忙吗？”

Gendo Ikari's collected voice snapped him out of his black hole of thoughts. Raising an eyebrow, Shinji smashed his fist into his other palm. "Right!" He exclaimed. How came the Slayer of Gods didn't cross his mind? Maybe he had been through the same event so many times his brain only followed a set pattern instead of coming up with new ideas. "We can use the Lance to kill the Angel and get her out!"  
源渡源堂的声音突然响起，将他从思绪的黑洞中拉了出来。眉毛一挑，真嗣一拳击在另一只手掌上。“对啊！”他喊道。怎么没想到那位弑神者呢？或许是因为经历了太多次同样的场景，他的大脑只会遵循固定的模式，而无法产生新的想法。“我们可以用长枪杀死使徒，把她救出来！”

He needed to make sure of it…before he could do anything.  
他需要确认这一点……才能采取任何行动。

"Get away from me!" “离我远点！”

Screaming in high pitch, Asuka staggered back from 'Shinji', who was wearing a confident and warm smile. "I will be your partner…your lover…whatever you want me to be. You don't need him anymore…that Shinji does not love you…he only uses you. He sees you as an object, a prize for him to claim, a stepping stone for him to achieve better. If you go back, one day he will betray you and leave you alone…but if you stay with me," the pseudo-Shinji changed shape to a nude form of himself. "We can be together forever. You can do everything you want with me."  
尖叫着，明日香踉跄地从‘真嗣’面前退开，他正带着自信而温暖的微笑。“我会成为你的伙伴……你的爱人……无论你希望我成为什么。你不再需要他了……那个真嗣并不爱你……他只是在利用你。他把你视为一个物品，一个他可以获得的奖赏，一个他向上攀登的垫脚石。如果你回去，总有一天他会背叛你，让你孤独一人……但如果你留在我身边，”假真嗣变形成赤裸的自己。“我们可以永远在一起。你可以对我做任何你想做的事。”

"No!" Asuka shrieked. "You're not Shinji! He loves me! He will never leave me! He promised! I don't want you, any of you! Leave me alone!"  
“不！”明日香尖叫道，“你不是真嗣！他爱我！他永远不会离开我！他答应过我！我不要你们，你们都走开！”

"But you cannot escape me. I have you trapped in here, you will surrender to me in time." 'Shinji' smiled a crooked smile. "Give up fighting, and become one with me forever…"  
“但你无法逃离我。我把你困在这里，你迟早会向我投降。”‘真嗣’露出了一个扭曲的微笑，“放弃抵抗，永远与我合为一体吧……”

"Shut up! I will never be with the likes of you!" Asuka kept stepping back. Unfortunately, since she wasn't looking behind her, she smashed her heel on the leg of the bench in the train car. Falling back first to the ground, Asuka groaned in pain.  
“闭嘴！我绝不会和你这种人在一起！”明日香不断后退。不幸的是，由于她没有注意身后，她的鞋跟撞到了车厢内长椅的腿上。她向后摔倒在地，痛苦地呻吟着。

"Why are you so stubborn? I'm everything he is, and I can be everything he isn't," 'Shinji' stepped closer to the frightened redhead, who was creeping backward away from him, but was soon intercepted by the wall of the train carriage.  
“你为何如此固执？我拥有他的一切，还能成为他所不能成为的一切，”‘真嗣’向惊恐的赤发少女逼近，她正小心翼翼地向后退去，但很快就被车厢的墙壁挡住了去路。

Seeing no way to escape anymore, Asuka closed her eyes and gritted her teeth. Slowly, she stood up from the floor and raised her eyelids, fixing a beaming gaze at 'Shinji's' eyes, utterly unperturbed by his nude form.  
眼看无路可逃，明日香闭上眼睛，咬紧牙关。她缓缓从地板上站起身，睁开眼帘，目光炯炯地直视着‘真嗣’的眼睛，对他的裸体毫不在意。

"So you've given up?" The fake Shinji cracked an evil grin. "Good choi-"  
"所以你放弃了？" 假真嗣邪恶地咧嘴一笑。"明智的选-"

PUNCH

"Oh, I've wanted to do this for a long time," Asuka growled, massaging her fist that just landed square in the face of 'Shinji'. "Damn you, Stupid Shinji! For making me wait so long!" Making a battle cry, Asuka charged forward and placed a sideway kick on the fake Shinji's head.  
"哦，我早就想这么做了，" 明日香咆哮着，揉着刚刚正中'真嗣'面门的拳头。"该死的，笨蛋真嗣！让我等这么久！" 她发出战斗的呐喊，冲上前去，一脚横扫在假真嗣的头上。

She blinked as she saw the train car surrounding her distort and break down after landing the kick. Cracking a twisted grin, Asuka dashed forward again with her fist ready. "Take this!" A well-calculated and well-executed uppercut connected with his jaw, sending the illusion flying across the train car that was already unrecognizable in shape.  
她眨了眨眼，看到自己踢中后，周围的列车车厢开始扭曲崩塌。明日香扭曲地咧嘴一笑，再次疾冲向前，拳头蓄势待发。"接招吧！" 一记精心计算、精准执行的上勾拳击中他的下巴，将幻象击飞到已经变形得无法辨认的车厢另一端。

"Yo**u** c_an_n**o**t _es_ca**p**e me **fo_r_**_e_v_**e**_r!" The voice turned from Shinji's to a distorted, distant scream.  
"你永远逃不出我的手掌心！" 那声音从真嗣的转变为扭曲而遥远的尖叫。

"He will come for me, he will never let me go! I trust him!" Asuka barked back. "Get lost, you freak! GET LOST!"  
"他会来找我的，他绝不会让我离开！我相信他！" 明日香回敬道。"滚开，你这个怪物！滚开！"

Before her last scream could subside, a bright flash of light enveloped the redhead. Asuka snapped her eyes open; the first thing she saw was the orange light of the countdown timer.  
在她最后一声尖叫消散之前，一道耀眼的光芒笼罩了红发少女。明日香猛地睁开眼睛；她首先看到的是倒计时计时器的橙色光芒。

MAIN ENERGY SUPPLY SYSTEM: EXTERNAL  
主能量供应系统：外部

ACTIVE TIME REMAINING: 8:88:88  
剩余活动时间：8:88:88

The pilot of Unit 02 blinked. Infinite power? External? Her umbilical cable was lost, that she was sure of. Then where this energy all came from?  
驾驶着二号机的驾驶员眨了眨眼。无限能量？外部供给？她的脐带电缆确实丢失了，这一点她很确定。那么这些能量究竟是从何而来？

Still, this was not the best time to ponder on technical details. Asuka pushed the controls forward, surprised to feel the EVA moving according to her thoughts. "Wunderbar." Smirking, Asuka pulled the prog knife out of her shoulder pylon.  
尽管如此，现在并不是深究技术细节的最佳时机。明日香向前推动操纵杆，惊讶地感觉到 EVA 按照她的想法移动。“太棒了。”明日香嘴角上扬，从肩部支架中抽出程序刀。

"I'll teach you a lesson…do not mess with Asuka Langley Soryu."  
“我会给你上一课……别惹惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”

"Unit 00 activation successful. Go to elevator E-17 and head down to Central Dogma."  
“零号机启动成功。前往电梯 E-17，前往中央教条区。”

"Roger." Came Rei's calm reply. "Heading to the position."  
"罗杰。" 丽平静地回应道，"正在前往指定位置。"

Shinji still kept staring at the black sphere with fire in his eyes, as if trying to burn a hole in it just by his gaze. He understood that Gendo wouldn't let him anywhere near Unit 01 under such state – Unit 00 by itself was enough to throw the Lance, anyway.  
真嗣仍然盯着那个黑色球体，眼中仿佛燃烧着火焰，似乎试图仅凭目光就在上面烧出一个洞。他明白在这种状态下，碇源堂绝不会让他靠近初号机——反正零号机本身就足以投掷长枪了。

Though it didn't help soothe the soreness in his chest. He was the one who tried to save Asuka, he was the one who had her in his grasp, and he was the one who let her slip away. No matter which way he looked at it, this was all his fault. And now Asuka was most likely dead because of it.  
尽管这并没有缓解他胸口的疼痛。是他试图拯救明日香，是他曾紧紧抓住她，也是他让她从手中滑落。无论从哪个角度看，这都是他的错。而现在，明日香很可能因此丧命。

"Approaching the elevator."  
接近电梯。

Shinji sighed. This was his last hope. "I'm sorry, Asuka. I-" He trailed off as he felt the ground started shaking slightly. "What the hell?" Suddenly he saw spiderweb-like cracks began to spread throughout the shadowy pool, blood-red illumination coming from the inside of them, LCL began to pour from the Dirac sea.  
真嗣叹了口气。这是他最后的希望。“对不起，明日香。我——”他话音未落，便感觉到地面微微震动。“搞什么鬼？”突然间，他看到阴影池中开始蔓延出蛛网般的裂缝，从裂缝内部透出血红色的光芒，LCL 从狄拉克海中涌出。

"Pattern blue detected! Inside the Angel!" Maya shouted in disbelief.  
“蓝色模式检测到了！在使徒内部！”玛雅难以置信地喊道。

"What?!" Ritsuko hastily rushed to her side. "Is this another Angel or something?"  
“什么？！”律子急忙冲到她身边。“这是另一个使徒还是什么？”

Up in the sky, the black and white sphere started to convulse. Its form began to shift, and a prominent bulge began to form on the side. The stretching expanded farther and farther until it started reaching disgusting levels of expansion that it seemed unnatural for the floating orb to still be intact, and then it finally ripped.  
天空中，那黑白相间的球体开始抽搐。它的形态开始变化，一侧逐渐隆起一个明显的凸起。这个凸起不断延伸，直到达到令人作呕的扩张程度，似乎对于这个悬浮的球体来说，还能保持完整是不自然的，最终它裂开了。

A giant utility knife ripped through what could be called the skin of the sphere, causing for a massive gush of blood-red LCL to spew all over the city below. Then from the cut, a second arm emerged, widening the gaping hole even wider. Pulling the sphere apart, the two arms ripped a large gash into it and caused another gush of LCL to shoot outward. It looked precisely like Unit 02, but at the same time looked nothing like it at all. Its slit eyes glowed a bright green that contrasted against the LCL that drenched its body.  
一把巨大的多功能刀划破了球体的外皮，导致大量的血红色 LCL 喷涌而出，洒满了下方的城市。随后，从切口中伸出了第二只手臂，将裂口撕得更大。两只手臂将球体撕开，形成了一个巨大的裂口，又一股 LCL 喷射而出。它看起来像 Unit 02，但同时又完全不像。它的裂缝眼睛发出明亮的绿色光芒，与浸透全身的 LCL 形成鲜明对比。

"Asuka?!" Shinji exclaimed.  
"明日香?!" 真嗣惊呼道。

The crimson EVA leaped out from the sphere through the cut, landing on the ground forcefully, raising a cloud of dust and dirt as it impacted. "Anyone can hear me? This is Pilot Soryu reporting in! Hello?" A familiar voice echoed through the command center.  
赤红的 EVA 从球体中跃出，穿过裂口，重重地落在地面上，激起一片尘土。"有人能听到我吗？这里是驾驶员惣流报告！喂？"一个熟悉的声音在指挥中心回荡。

Never before had Shinji felt her voice so _liberating_.  
真嗣从未感到她的声音如此令人振奋。

The crimson EVA shut down the instant it contacted the ground. "Pattern blue eliminated! The Angel is neutralized!" Maya reported in relief.  
赤红的 EVA 一接触地面便立即停机。“蓝色模式消除！使徒已被中和！”玛雅松了口气地报告道。

Inside his father's office, he could hear cheers of people in the background. Behind him, Gendo's lips formed something that could be seen as a small smile with the use of a microscope.  
在他的父亲办公室内，他能听到背景中人们的欢呼声。在他身后，碇源堂的嘴唇形成了一个微小的弧度，若非借助显微镜几乎难以察觉。

"Asuka!" Shinji burst into the ward he was told his favorite redhead would be in, completely oblivious to the environment he was in that required silence and peace. "Asuka, are you alright?"  
“明日香！”真嗣冲进了被告知他心爱的红发女孩所在的病房，完全不顾周围需要安静与平和的环境。“明日香，你还好吗？”

The first scene that greeted him was Asuka wearing a white hospital gown and sitting on the bed chatting with Misato. The noise he produced attracted both of the two occupants of the ward's attentions. "Shinji!" The redhead exclaimed in joy, a smile bloomed on her face.  
他首先看到的是明日香穿着白色病号服坐在床上与美里聊天的场景。他发出的声响吸引了病房里两位住客的注意。"真嗣！"红发女孩惊喜地喊道，脸上绽放出笑容。

Shinji couldn't help but have his own relieved grin wash across his face as he walked toward her bedside. "How do you feel, Asuka?" Shinji asked with concern. "It's been...almost 19 hours since you got...absorbed." It was something he still had a hard time believing. How did she still have power, let alone rip the Angel apart by herself?  
真嗣忍不住露出了释然的微笑，走向她的床边。“你感觉怎么样，明日香？”真嗣关切地问道，“你被……吸收已经过去快 19 个小时了。”这件事他仍然难以置信。她怎么还能有力量，更别提独自撕裂使徒了？

"I'm mostly okay, just very hungry right now. The glucose solution in the IV doesn't fill the...emptiness in my stomach. So I really want a proper dinner right now." She stretched in bed. "Say, when can I go home?"  
“我基本上还好，就是现在非常饿。点滴里的葡萄糖溶液填不满……我胃里的空虚感。所以我现在真的很想吃一顿正经的晚餐。”她在床上伸展了一下身体，“对了，我什么时候能回家？”

"There's still...debriefing you need to go through," Misato sighed. "It's standard procedure, sorry I can't do much about it. Anyway, the debriefing starts as soon as you feel fit for it. Understood?"  
“你还需要……进行一些汇报，”美里叹了口气，“这是标准程序，抱歉我帮不上什么忙。总之，只要你感觉合适，汇报就会开始。明白了吗？”

"Whatever," Asuka pouted. "Well, I'd like to talk with Shinji...privately. Could you please...?"  
"随便啦，" 明日香噘嘴道，"不过，我想和真嗣...私下谈谈。你能...吗？"

Misato raised an eyebrow. Asuka asking for things, was so rare she thought she could mark this day on the calendar with a big red star, much less nicely. She wasn't going to complain, though. If her young charges want a bit of private time, she had no problems with it. "Sure, I'll wait outside. Do ten minutes sounds good enough to you?"  
美里挑了挑眉。明日香主动要求事情，如此罕见，她觉得简直可以在日历上用一颗大红星标记这一天，更别提态度还这么好了。不过，她并不打算抱怨。如果她的年轻队员们想要一点私人时间，她对此毫无异议。“当然，我会在外面等。十分钟对你来说够吗？”

"That should be enough." Came the reply from the redhead. Misato nodded and left the room.  
“应该够了。”红发少女回答道。美里点点头，离开了房间。

With a hiss the ward door closed shut. Asuka immediately seized Shinji's hands which were resting on top of her sheet, and held them in an iron grip. "Shinji..." She started, her voice tender and light. "I...I thought I won't see you again..." She sobbed, disguised as a sigh.  
随着一声嘶嘶声，病房门紧紧关闭。明日香立刻抓住了伸治放在她床单上的双手，紧紧握住，仿佛铁钳一般。“伸治……”她轻声开口，声音温柔而轻盈。“我……我以为再也见不到你了……”她哽咽着，伪装成一声叹息。

Shinji gently squeezed her hand, not caring his hand could get bruised at all. "Asuka...I thought I lost you...I almost freaked out, after the countdown went zero." He looked directly into her eyes, still found it mesmerizing that those two blue orbs could show so many emotions without her speaking. "How...how did you get out?"  
伸治温柔地握紧她的手，毫不在意自己的手可能会被捏伤。“明日香……我以为我失去了你……倒计时归零后，我几乎要崩溃了。”他直视着她的眼睛，依然觉得那双蓝色眼眸在不言中能表达如此多的情感，令人着迷。“你……你是怎么逃出来的？”

Was it Mrs. Soryu? He needed to know about it.  
是惣流女士吗？他需要知道这一切。

"I...I don't know," replied Asuka in a shaky voice. After a moment of pondering, she continued, "After I watched my timer die, I must've passed out. I thought I died, and had a weird conversation with myself and...the Angel?" She frowned a little. "It tried to use your image to seduce me and make me stay...but I was strong enough to resist it. Then I woke up, my EVA somehow had infinite power, I simply fought my way out, I guess."  
“我……我不知道，”明日香用颤抖的声音回答。沉思片刻后，她继续说道，“在我看到计时器归零后，我一定是昏过去了。我以为我死了，然后和一个奇怪的自己以及……天使？进行了对话。”她微微皱眉。“它试图用你的形象来诱惑我，让我留下……但我足够坚强，抵抗住了。然后我醒来，我的 EVA 不知怎么有了无限能量，我想我就是这么一路打出来的。”

As much as Shinji trusted her to tell him the truth, he found her experience surreal. Not the dream part, but her EVA had infinite power left. It couldn't be Kyoto, otherwise she would've told him, considering they already talked about their mothers.  
尽管真嗣相信她会告诉他真相，但他觉得她的经历不可思议。不是梦境的部分，而是她的 EVA 还拥有无限能量。这不可能是京都，否则她早就告诉他了，毕竟他们已经谈过各自的母亲。

Then what could it be?  
那会是什么呢？

"Shinji..." Asuka's voice broke him out of his train of thoughts. "When I was in there...I was so afraid that I...I would never see you again. I regretted doubting you. I wanted to say so many things. Shinji, I-"  
“真嗣...”明日香的声音打断了他的思绪。“当我身处其中时...我非常害怕...我...再也见不到你了。我后悔怀疑你。我想说很多话。真嗣，我-”

She was silenced by a finger put on her lips. "Asuka...this moment is perfect as it is. You don't need to rush anything, I know how do you feel about me." He smiled a warm smile. "It's good to have you back, Asuka."  
她被放在唇边的一根手指止住了话语。“明日香...此刻已是完美无缺。你无需急于求成，我明白你对我的感情。”他露出了温暖的笑容。“能再次见到你，真好，明日香。”

"It's good to be back, too, Baka-Shinji," Asuka spoke in a tender voice.  
“能回来真好，笨蛋真嗣，”明日香用温柔的声音说道。

"Now, let's not make our guardian wait any longer, shall we?" Shinji stood up, though keeping their hands still in contact. "Do you want me to go home and make you something special, or do you want me to wait for you here?"  
“现在，我们别让监护人等太久，好吗？”真嗣站起身来，尽管他们的手依然紧握。“你想让我回家给你做点特别的，还是在这里等你？”

Asuka grinned. "I'd rather have a welcome home feast ready when I get there," at the moment her stomach growled in protest. Blushing, she continued, "I'll be looking forward to it!"  
明日香咧嘴一笑。"我更希望回家时有一顿欢迎宴等着我，"此时她的肚子咕噜抗议起来。她脸一红，继续说，"我可是很期待的！"

"Yes, ma'am." "遵命，女士。"

It was about eleven o'clock in the night when Misato's routine binge drinking started to show its true colors. Unable to hold back her urinating desire anymore, Misato got up from her bed lazily and opened her bedroom door before turning on the lights in the living room.  
大约晚上十一点，美里惯常的酗酒行为开始显露出其真实面目。再也抑制不住尿意的她，懒洋洋地从床上爬起，打开卧室门，随后打开了客厅的灯。

"Ohhh…" Misato stumbled toward the bathroom. "Huh?" Still under the heavy influence of alcohol, she couldn't really make out the sight in front of her clearly – Asuka slid open her own bedroom's door, her eyes puffy and blurred. She wore a rather flimsy nightgown that faintly revealed the undergarments under it, carrying a thin sheet designed for the hot summer night.  
“哦……”美里跌跌撞撞地走向浴室。“嗯？”酒精的强烈影响下，她无法清晰地辨认眼前的景象——明日香拉开自己卧室的门，双眼浮肿模糊。她穿着一件相当单薄的睡裙，隐约透出里面的内衣，手里还拿着一条薄薄的床单，专为炎热的夏夜准备。

"Asuka?" Misato couldn't help but ask as the redhead slid the door close.  
“明日香？”美里忍不住问道，只见红发少女将门轻轻合上。

The said girl raised an eyebrow. Her drowsy mind failed to process why Misato was awake at this time of the day. "… Can't sleep…" She mumbled half to herself, not being able to distinguish between reality and illusions.  
那女孩挑了挑眉。她昏昏欲睡的头脑无法理解为什么美里会在这种时候醒来。“……睡不着……”她喃喃自语，半是对自己说，分不清现实与幻觉。

The effect of alcohol had just subsided a little. Misato curled her four fingers, thumbs-backward pointing behind her. "It's okay…you can sleep in my-"  
酒精的影响刚刚消退了一些。美里蜷起四根手指，拇指向后指向她身后。“没事的……你可以睡在我的……”

However Asuka walked straight to Shinji's room before Misato even started speaking, her movements were so skilled it didn't look like it was the first time she'd done this at all.  
然而，还没等美里说完，明日香就直接走向了真嗣的房间，她的动作如此熟练，看起来完全不像是第一次这么做。

"…Room…" Asuka had already entered Shinji's room and shut off the door when Misato let out her final word.  
“…房间…” 在美里说出最后一个字时，明日香已经进入了真嗣的房间并关上了门。

"Eh?" Misato shook her head. About two seconds later, the meaning of Asuka's actions reached the conscious brain. A confused Pen-Pen walked out of Misato's bedroom, attracted by the bright light, and joined Misato together staring at Shinji's bedroom door.  
“诶？” 美里摇了摇头。大约两秒后，明日香的行为意义才传达到她的意识中。被明亮的灯光吸引，困惑的企鹅 Pen-Pen 从美里的卧室走出，与美里一起盯着真嗣的卧室门。

Misato blinked, pretty sure she just saw something that was not there. "They… they've always been like this for these days?"  
美里眨了眨眼，确信自己刚刚看到了不该存在的东西。“他们…这些天一直这样吗？”

Pen-Pen nodded, waving his wings in a particular fashion.  
Pen-Pen 点了点头，用翅膀做了一个特别的动作。

"They've done much more?!" Misato failed to contain her volume.  
“他们做了更多？！”美里没能控制住自己的音量。

Pen-Pen nodded again. Pen-Pen 再次点了点头。

"Wha-" Misato tried her best to sort out the turmoil of thoughts in her head, then rushed into the bathroom after dawning horror of realization struck her.  
“什——”美里竭力整理着脑海中纷乱的思绪，随即在意识到可怕真相的瞬间冲进了浴室。

"Misato…" Asuka tried again, her voice was a perfect mix of exasperation and resignation. Shinji sat beside her on the couch, their hands together in a tight grip. "We didn't have sex, no matter what you're imagining!"  
“美里…” 明日香再次尝试，她的声音完美地融合了恼怒与无奈。真嗣坐在她旁边的沙发上，两人的手紧紧相握。“我们没有发生关系，不管你在想象什么！”

"Asuka, I could understand it when you needed…assistance," Misato carefully chose her words, not wanting to stir up painful memories. "But now? What's the reason for you two sleeping together?"  
“明日香，当你需要…帮助时，我能理解，”美里小心翼翼地选择措辞，不想勾起痛苦的回忆。“但现在呢？你们俩睡在一起的理由是什么？”

"How about that we're together, satisfied?" Asuka barked, raising their clasped hands for her to see. "Now you can have Kaji for all I care!"  
"瞧我们这样在一起，满意了吧？" 明日香嚷道，举起他们紧握的手让她看。"现在你可以尽情拥有加持，我才不在乎呢！"

"Wha-you brat, there's nothing - awww damn it," Misato conceded; Asuka smirked in triumph. Messaging her temple, the lavender-haired woman continued, "you two are just cute together. I'm happy for you, really. However, sleeping together? How would you convince me that you would never do stupid things under the heat of a moment?" She didn't find any condoms or pills in the trashcan - she didn't know whether it should make her relieved or worry.  
“什-你这小鬼，没什么——哎呀该死，”美里无奈地承认；明日香得意地笑了。轻敲自己的太阳穴，紫发的女子继续说道，“你们俩在一起真是可爱。我真为你们高兴，真的。但是，睡在一起？你怎么说服我你们不会在激情时刻做出蠢事？”她没在垃圾桶里找到避孕套或药片——她不知道这该让她松一口气还是担忧。

"Misato… we've been…sleeping in the same bed, sometimes hers, sometimes mine, for a long while. Just to keep the loneliness away. And we still… hadn't done anything you wouldn't approve yet. What makes you think we will?" Shinji interjected. "We might be teenagers, but we're responsible."  
"美里…我们一直…轮流睡在彼此的床上，有时是她的，有时是我的，已经很久了。只是为了驱散孤独。而我们仍然…还没有做过任何你不会同意的事情。你凭什么认为我们会呢？" 真嗣插话道。"我们可能是青少年，但我们是有责任心的。"

"Damn right," Asuka followed, conveniently ignoring the first thing she tried to do after they officially became together. "We're not like you, indecent adults! I'm still a prim and proper young lady!"  
"没错，" 明日香接着说，顺带忽略了他们正式在一起后她试图做的第一件事。"我们不像你们这些不检点的成年人！我仍然是个端庄得体的年轻女士！"

Misato silently cursed at her own obliviousness. "But…this is too dangerous. I just…" Her gaze fell. "I just don't want you to repeat my path. Okay, few rules," she raised her hand, her fingers spread. "First, no sex is allowed in my apartment!" She ticked off her thumb. "Second, you can sleep together, but with the door open," she ticked off her index finger; Asuka's expression turned from surprised to dejected once again. "Third, you can go on dates, but come back home before ten." She ticked off another finger.  
美里默默地咒骂自己的迟钝。“但是……这太危险了。我只是……”她的目光低垂。“我只是不想你们重蹈我的覆辙。好吧，几条规矩，”她举起手，手指张开。“第一，我的公寓里不允许发生性行为！”她弯下拇指。“第二，你们可以一起睡，但门必须开着，”她弯下食指；明日香的表情从惊讶转为沮丧。“第三，你们可以约会，但必须在十点前回家。”她又弯下一根手指。

Asuka sighed. "Rest assured, Misato. We will follow the rules…and take things slower. If you still have doubts, you can always ask Dr. Akagi to give me physicals, right? She will know about…my condition."  
明日香叹了口气。“放心吧，美里。我们会遵守规则……并且放慢节奏。如果你还有疑虑，随时可以请赤木博士给我做体检，对吧？她会了解我的……状况。”

"Right. Speaking of which…" Misato snapped her fingers. "Ritsuko said she wanted to give you a thorough examination today."  
“对。说到这个……”美里打了个响指。“律子说今天想给你做个彻底的检查。”

"WHAT?!" Asuka exclaimed. "But I just had one!"  
"什么？！" 明日香惊呼。"但我刚刚才喝了一瓶！"

Misato shrugged. "We can never be too careful. No one knows what could happen to your body after 19 hours of constant exposure to LCL."  
美里耸了耸肩。"我们永远不能太过小心。没人知道你的身体在连续 19 小时暴露于 LCL 后会发生什么。"

"Fine!" Asuka pouted. "好啦！" 明日香噘着嘴说道。

"Are you fucking kidding me? There's still more after this?!"  
"你他妈的在逗我吗？这之后还有？!"

The redheaded hurricane swept across the hallway of NERV despite the weather forecast saying otherwise. Major Katsuragi, unfortunately, stood at the right front quadrant of the storm, taking the worst hit. Rubbing her ears, she said, "Now, now Asuka, calm down. The Human Instrumentality Committee insists that you have a few words with them. They have power over us, so we can't really do anything about it. I've told them about your condition. They've consented to keep it short."  
尽管天气预报并非如此，红发飓风还是席卷了 NERV 的走廊。不幸的是，葛城美里少校正好站在风暴的前端，承受了最猛烈的冲击。她揉着耳朵说道：“好了，好了，明日香，冷静点。人类补完委员会坚持要你和他们谈几句。他们有权有势，我们也没办法。我已经向他们说明了你的情况。他们同意尽量简短。”

"Whatever…just get this over with," Asuka growled in annoyance. Energy bars and mineral water weren't exactly the feast she's been looking forward to, and the fact that she'd been denied Shinji's cooking for even longer didn't help, if not making the anxiety worse. "Where?"  
"随便吧……赶紧结束这事儿，"明日香恼怒地咕哝着。能量棒和矿泉水远非她期待的大餐，而且被剥夺了更长时间享受真嗣的料理，这不仅没有缓解，反而加剧了她的焦虑。"去哪儿？"

"In the teleconference room. Just upstairs." Misato answered. "Follow me."  
"在视频会议室。就在楼上。" 美里回答道，"跟我来。"

"Right on your heels." Asuka made a pouty face and followed along. The NERV hallway was busy, to say the least, after the attack of the eleventh Angel, designated Leliel. Technicians and officers jogged past the duo without so much as courteous greetings.  
"紧随其后。" 明日香做出一副赌气的表情，跟了上去。NERV 的走廊在第十一使徒 Leliel 袭击后，至少可以说是忙碌不堪。技术人员和官员们匆匆从两人身边跑过，连基本的礼貌招呼都顾不上。

The door of the teleconference room slid open, Asuka shivered as a wave of cold air washed through her. The room was dark with six seats that surrounded a table lighted by different colors, though there were no holograms of their interrogators present, only the blonde Doctor of Project E stood in the corner of the room with a notepad in her hands.  
会议室的门缓缓滑开，一股寒气袭来，让明日香不禁打了个寒颤。房间内昏暗，六把椅子环绕着一张被不同颜色灯光照亮的桌子，尽管没有审讯者的全息影像，只有金发的 E 计划博士站在房间角落，手里拿着笔记本。

Asuka tried to maintain her poker face with the visible effort since the eeriness of the environment was freaking every one of her nerves out. Major Katsuragi, on the other hand, seemed to be much calmer as if she had been here many times before. A beam of light from overhead shined on them; an ancient voice sounded. "Pilot Soryu, when you were absorbed into the Angel, did it try to communicate with you in any means?"  
明日香努力维持着扑克脸，周围环境的诡异让她每一根神经都紧绷着。葛城美里少校则显得镇定许多，仿佛已经来过这里多次。一束光线从头顶照射下来，一个古老的声音响起：“Soryu 驾驶员，当你被使徒吸收时，它是否尝试以任何方式与你沟通？”

The pilot of Unit 02 gulped; the voice sounded like sawing trees to her, making her cringe. As much as she wanted to yell at those people for wasting her time that would've been spent with Shinji, she still needed to show some courtesy to those… higher-ranking officers? "No, sir. I do not remember such an occurrence. Everything is fuzzy when the life support ran out."  
02 号机驾驶员咽了口唾沫；那声音对她来说就像锯木头一样刺耳，让她不禁皱眉。尽管她很想对那些人发火，指责他们浪费了她本可以和真嗣在一起的时间，但她仍需对那些……高级军官保持一定的礼貌。“没有，长官。我不记得有这样的事。生命维持系统失效后，一切都变得模糊不清。”

"That is if you remember correctly," another voice sounded.  
“那只是如果你记得正确的话，”另一个声音响起。

"Dr. Akagi's examinations detected none of outside tampering with her memories," Misato threw a glance at the said woman, who looked like she was taking notes.  
"赤木博士的检查并未发现她的记忆有外部篡改的痕迹，" 美里瞥了一眼那位正在做笔记的女性。

"The AC recorder of Unit 02 ceased functioning not long after the absorption. So we can't confirm it." The voice was becoming increasingly annoyed. "How can we know whether the Angels were interested in human minds?"  
"二号机的外部记录器在吸收后不久就停止工作了。所以我们无法确认。" 声音变得越来越不耐烦。"我们怎么知道使徒是否对人类的心灵感兴趣？"

"No offense, but we can't answer that," Misato said resignedly. "We don't even know whether or not they have their own minds, let alone understand humans."  
"无意冒犯，但我们无法回答这个问题，" 美里无奈地说。"我们甚至不知道它们是否有自己的心智，更别提理解人类了。"

The members decided to change the subject since they knew they were not getting anywhere with this determined Major. "Do we know whether the eleventh Angel is related in anyways with the next one?"  
成员们决定换个话题，因为他们知道在这个坚定的少校面前毫无进展。“我们是否知道第十一使徒与下一个有什么关联？”

"Negative. From the past patterns, the Angels never showed any sign of coordination."  
“否定。从过去的模式来看，使徒从未表现出任何协同迹象。”

"Right, they had been acting on their own." The voice said, "at least until now."  
“对，它们一直各自为战。”那个声音说道，“至少到目前为止。”

Misato's eyebrows raised. What were they implying by that statement? Would Angels attack in coordination in the future? It was already hard enough to fight one Angel at a time, facing two at once? Or even more? She didn't dare to imagine how that would turn out. "Excuse me…What did you mean by that?"  
美里眉头一挑。他们这话是什么意思？难道使徒将来会协同攻击？本就难以一对一应对，同时面对两个？甚至更多？她不敢想象那会是什么局面。“请问……您这话是什么意思？”

"This is irrelevant to you. Now leave."  
“这与你无关。现在离开。”

Misato shrugged and tapped Asuka on the shoulder, who nodded and followed her out of the room. This place was creepy that she didn't want to stay here any longer.  
美里耸了耸肩，轻拍明日香的肩膀，后者点头后跟着她离开了房间。这个地方阴森森的，她不想再待下去了。

As the duo left the room, Dr. Akagi's dark eyes kept tracking the slender form of the redhead until they disappeared behind the door. From the throughout physical and mental examination given to the redhead, she couldn't even find a minuscule amount of anomaly. Ritsuko dreaded she was an imposter created by the Angel, and the fact that Unit 02 literally broke the first law of thermodynamics didn't help  
当两人离开房间时，赤木律子的深邃目光始终追随着红发少女纤细的身影，直到她们消失在门后。从对红发少女进行的全面身心检查来看，她甚至找不到一丝一毫的异常。律子担心她可能是使徒制造的冒牌货，而二号机实际上打破了热力学第一定律的事实更是雪上加霜。

From theories, EVAs could go berserk and act on their own free will. However, when Unit 02 came out, the pilot was in total control. Ritsuko narrowed her eyes further. As for the AC recorder being dysfunctional…she checked the hard disk of the recorder after the battle, but all the data was gone. The data wasn't _damaged_ or _deleted; it_ was more like…_formatted._  
根据理论，EVA 可能会发狂并自行其是。然而，当二号机出现时，驾驶员完全掌控了局面。律子眯起眼睛更深地思索。至于 AC 记录器的故障……她在战斗后检查了记录器的硬盘，但所有数据都消失了。数据既未损坏也未被删除；更像是……被格式化了。

Did Asuka format the data by herself? Ritsuko sighed. There were still so many things she didn't know about the EVAs, and she intended to find out.  
是明日香亲自整理的数据吗？律子叹了口气。关于 EVA，她还有太多未知，而她决心要一探究竟。

"We're home…" came a tired voice from the front door of the apartment, followed by rustling sounds of two pairs of shoes slipping off.  
“我们回来了……”公寓前门传来疲惫的声音，紧接着是两双鞋子脱下的窸窣声。

"Welcome home!" Shinji shouted from the kitchen. "Dinner's almost ready!"  
"欢迎回家！" 真嗣从厨房喊道，"晚饭快好了！"

"Almost? What took you so long?" Asuka questioned. "It's been almost two hours, right? I was hoping to have-" She trailed off and went mouth agape as she set her eyes on the content on the dining table.  
“差点？怎么花了这么久？”明日香质问道，“都快两小时了，对吧？我还指望能——”她话音未落，目光落在餐桌上的内容时，嘴巴张得大大的。

It was a German feast. Nothing like one or two German dishes she had been expecting.  
这是一场德国盛宴。与她之前预期的那种一两道德国菜完全不同。

"Shinji…" She started, suddenly feeling guilty scolding him before. "Did…did you make all of this? For me?"  
“真嗣…”她开口道，突然为自己之前的责备感到内疚。“你…你做了所有这些吗？为了我？”

"Of course, who else would I do this for?" Shinji replied, picking up the last dish and headed to the dining area. "C'mon. You might want to hurry before it gets cold."  
“当然，除了你我还能为谁做这些呢？”真嗣回答，端起最后一道菜走向餐厅。“快来吧。趁热吃，别等凉了。”

Asuka had to blink away the hotness that suddenly surged up the corner of her eyes. No one had ever done anything like this for her ever before, not even her momma. "Thank you, Baka-Shinji." Smiling a warm smile that could make at least two people's hearts flutter, she sat down beside the table and dug in.  
"明日香不得不眨眼驱散突然涌上眼角的灼热感。从未有人为她做过这样的事，就连妈妈也没有。“谢谢你，笨蛋真嗣。”她露出一个温暖的微笑，足以让至少两个人的心为之颤动，随即坐到桌旁，开始享用。”

"Awww, adorable isn't it," Misato blabbed happily as she beheld the pleasant scene.  
"“哇，真可爱，不是吗？”美里开心地赞叹着，目睹这温馨的场景。”

"Asuka, your birthday is next Sunday, right?" Shinji's inquiry came to her.  
"明日香，你的生日是下周日，对吧？" 真嗣的询问传到了她耳中。

Asuka swallowed her mouthful of food before raising her eyes to look at Shinji. "Actually, yeah," she replied after a few seconds of ponderings. Damn, if not for him reminding her, she couldn't even remember her own birthday since she had never had one ever since her mother died and her enrollement into the Evangelion Program.  
明日香咽下口中的食物，抬起眼眸看向真嗣。"其实，是的，"她沉吟几秒后回答。该死，要不是他提醒，她甚至记不起自己的生日，自从母亲去世并加入福音战士计划以来，她从未真正庆祝过生日。

"Are you going to throw a surprise party for your sweetheart, hmm?" Misato winked.  
"你打算给你的心上人办个惊喜派对吗，嗯？" 美里眨眼道。

"Well…" “嗯……”

"Shinji," Asuka interjected in a firm voice. "You…" Her tone turned softer as she continued. "You've done enough for me. I want to reciprocate. How about this?" She rubbed her chin. "On my birthday, you will take me out on a date, but _I_ will be the one planning. This way, we can both enjoy my birthday, while I can also do something for you!"  
"真嗣," 明日香坚定地插话道。"你……"她的语气变得柔和起来，继续说道。"你为我做的已经够多了。我想回报你。这样如何？"她摩挲着下巴。"在我生日那天，你带我出去约会，但由我来策划。这样，我们都能享受我的生日，同时我也能为你做点什么！"

Shinji pondered for a moment. Even though he was almost certain he could plan the date better than her since he had more experience, especially when compared to Asuka's non-existent-if-not-only-theoretical knowledge on the subject of matter, she was making a valid point. Knowing how proud she was, completely pampering her in a relationship wouldn't benefit her mentality. She needed to confirm that she had her own place in this relationship, and it's necessary.  
真嗣沉思了一会儿。尽管他几乎可以肯定自己能比她更好地策划这次约会，毕竟他的经验更丰富，尤其是与明日香在这方面的非存在性——如果不是仅限于理论知识的话——相比，她的提议确实有道理。知道她有多骄傲，完全在关系中宠溺她并不利于她的心态。她需要确认自己在这种关系中有自己的位置，这是必要的。

"Sure, I'll see what the great Asuka Langley Soryu has for me!"  
"当然，我倒要看看伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷有什么安排给我！"

"Just you wait, Shinji. I'm sure our date will blow your mind." Asuka smirked, her usual haughtiness returning to her voice. "I tried to ask you out for a date before, but you had other business to attend to that time. This time, though, you don't get to escape from it!"  
“你就等着吧，真嗣。我敢肯定我们的约会会让你大吃一惊。”明日香得意地笑了，她那惯有的傲慢语气又回来了。“我之前想约你出去，但你那时有别的事要忙。这次，你可逃不掉了！”

Misato watched her charges with satisfaction and amusement, feeling proud that her parenting approach finally started to bear fruit.  
美里满意而有趣地看着她的孩子们，感到自豪，因为她的育儿方法终于开始见效了。

Commander Ikari sat in the middle of the circle of monoliths in his standard pose, covering his mouth with his folded hands and using the reflection from his glasses to hide his eyes. Not that he needed to hide his features, though, as everything the Committee was weighing on him had no bearing on him.  
碇司令以他标准的姿势坐在石碑圈的中央，双手合十遮住口部，利用眼镜的反光隐藏双眼。虽然他并不需要隐藏自己的表情，毕竟委员会所施加的压力对他而言并无实质影响。

"The prototype of the Dummy Plug System is not quite meeting our expectations," SEELE 01 growled deeply; impatience radiated from his husky voice. "Our trust in you is running thin."  
“Dummy Plug 系统的原型机未能达到我们的预期，”SEELE 01 低沉地咆哮道，粗哑的声音中透出急躁。“我们对你的信任正在减弱。”

Not that he actually trusted Gendo in the first place.  
倒不是说他一开始就真的信任源堂。

"Computers would never be as good as human pilots," Gendo huffed.  
"“计算机永远比不上人类飞行员。”源渡哼了一声。”

"Irrelevant." SEELE 03 snapped. "What we need is stability, not acrobatic skills!"  
"无关紧要。" SEELE 03 厉声道。"我们需要的是稳定，不是杂技技巧！"

"Regardless, that's the best we've got so far." Staring straight ahead, Gendo Ikari spoke. "The development of Dummy Plug System is a delicate process. We need more time and resources."  
"无论如何，这是我们目前最好的方案。" 碇源堂直视前方说道。"Dummy Plug 系统的开发是一个精细的过程。我们需要更多的时间和资源。"

"Our schedule is seriously delayed!" SEELE 05 interjected, his voice on fire. "You're here only because we have a use for you, keep that in mind!"  
"我们的计划严重滞后了！" SEELE 05 插话道，声音中带着怒火。"你能在这里只是因为我们有用得着你的地方，记住这一点！"

"Of course." A faint smirk appeared on his face, hidden behind his clasped hands. From his son, he learned that the Dummy Plug System was mainly used in the MP EVAs. Delaying its development would definitely impede their construction process, which would likely buy them more time.  
"当然。" 他脸上掠过一丝淡淡的微笑，隐藏在紧扣的双手之后。从他儿子那里，他得知 Dummy Plug 系统主要用于 MP EVA 中。推迟其开发无疑会阻碍他们的建造进程，这很可能会为他们争取更多时间。

Now it seemed his plan was starting to take effect.  
现在看来，他的计划似乎开始见效了。

"Do we have any updates on Units 03 and 04?" Gendo Ikari started again.  
“03 和 04 号机有什么新进展吗？”碇源堂再次问道。

"We still want to hold onto them a bit longer," SEELE 07 replied. "Tests aren't yet concluded."  
“我们还想再保留它们一段时间，”Seele 07 回答道，“测试尚未完成。”

Even though he didn't say it out loud, Gendo still saw his true intentions through his mask. Evangelions were the ultimate war machines of humanity, as a world superpower, it's comprehendible that the United States would want to have one or two of them under its belt. He wasn't going to make it easy for them, though. "I need more Evangelions to fight the Angels. Make it quick."  
尽管他没有明说，碇源堂仍透过他的面具看穿了他的真实意图。EVA 是人类的终极战争机器，作为世界超级大国，美国想要拥有一两台也是可以理解的。但他不会让他们轻易得逞。"我需要更多的 EVA 来对抗使徒。尽快完成。"

"You already have three perfectly working Units," SEELE 07 shot back. "Why do you need more?"  
"你已经有三台功能完好的 EVA 了，" SEELE 07 反驳道，"为什么还需要更多？"

"True, but we all know Unit 01 and Unit 00 are…necessary," Gendo retorted. "I need more expandable Units. During the last sortie, we almost lost Unit 02 and its pilot. Better safe than sorry." Of course, he would never let the old men know the importance of the Second Child, or he could risk SEELE blackmailing him.  
"确实，但我们大家都知道零号机和初号机是……必要的，" 碇源堂反驳道，"我需要更多可扩展的 EVA。在上一次出击中，我们差点失去了二号机及其驾驶员。宁可备而不用，也不要用而无备。" 当然，他绝不会让那些老头子知道二号适格者的重要性，否则他可能会面临 SEELE 的威胁。"

"Still-" "尽管如此-"

"Transfer Unit 03 to NERV Headquarters," SEELE 01 cut him off. "One Evangelion is enough for the North American branch to delve into."  
"将 03 号单位转移至 NERV 总部，" SEELE 01 打断了他。"北美分部研究一台 EVA 已经足够了。"

"As far as I'm concerned, Unit 03 doesn't have a pilot, correct?" Commander Ikari probed. Knowing that Unit 03 was possessed by the Angel from Shinji, while he only needed working EVAs, turning it down would be the only logical course of action. "I demand Unit 04 to be transferred along with its test pilot."  
"就我而言，03 号机没有驾驶员，对吧？" 碇司令试探道。他知道 03 号机被真嗣体内的使徒侵占，而他只需要可用的 EVA，拒绝接收是唯一合理的做法。"我要求将 04 号机及其试飞员一并转移过来。"

"Fine." SEELE 07 conceded, "Prepare to receive Unit 04 and the test pilot on Saturday."  
"好吧。" SEELE 07 让步道，"准备在周六接收 04 号机和试飞员。"

"Understood." With that, the holograms of the monoliths faded into the darkness, the lights lit up moments later. Gendo Ikari unclasped his hands, standing up from his seat. Fixing a gaze at the image of the Tree of Life imprinted on the roof of his office, he smirked, tasting his small victory.  
"明白了。" 随着话音落下，那些巨石的全息影像逐渐消失在黑暗中，片刻后灯光亮起。碇源堂松开双手，从座位上站起身来。他凝视着办公室天花板上印着的生命之树图像，嘴角勾起，品味着这场小小的胜利。

"Yo, Shin-man, why are you grinning like an idiot?" The Jock Stooge probed as he came back from the cafeteria, carrying several hotdogs and a soda drink. "Did you fall in love or something?"  
"哟，真嗣，你笑得像个傻子似的，怎么回事？" 体育生跟班从自助餐厅回来，手里拿着几根热狗和一瓶汽水，好奇地问道，"你是不是恋爱了？"

Snapping back to reality, Shinji shook his head and fixed a gaze at his friend that questioned his sanity. "Drop it, alright?" In fact, he was just happy that Asuka came out of Leliel unharmed, so he couldn't help but grin as he was zoning out. He just solved…well, _went through_ an unprecedented deviance yet managed to not fuck it up.  
回过神来，真嗣摇了摇头，用一种质疑朋友理智的眼神盯着他。“别提了，好吗？”实际上，他只是很高兴明日香从雷里尔毫发无损地出来了，所以在走神时忍不住笑了。他刚刚解决了一个前所未有的偏差，但幸好没有搞砸。

"Shin-man, did she…" Kensuke threw a sideways glance at the Red Devil, who was walking toward them but still having a distance, and whispered into Shinji's ear. "Did she get you whipped or something?"  
“真嗣，她是不是……”健介斜眼瞥了一眼正朝他们走来但还有一段距离的红发恶魔，低声对真嗣耳语道。“她是不是把你驯服了还是怎么的？”

Shinji sighed in exasperation. He had always found Kensuke and Toji's endless interest in his personal life annoying. "It's not that. She almost got hurt during the last Angel attack. I'm just happy that she's okay." He executed his technically accurate statement.  
真嗣无奈地叹了口气。他一直觉得健介和东治对他个人生活的无尽兴趣很烦人。“不是那样的。她上次在对抗使徒时差点受伤。我只是很高兴她没事。”他给出了一个技术上准确的说法。

"Sure, just let us know if you need help!" Toji hid his mouth behind his hand in a vain attempt to block the sound waves that traveled through the air. "Remember, we're-"  
"当然，需要帮忙就告诉我们！" 冬二用手掩住嘴，试图阻挡声波在空气中传播，"记住，我们是——"

"Whatcha talkin' about, stooges?" Came redheaded jump-scaring voice that literally made Toji and Kensuke jump from their spot. "You'd better not be speaking ill of me behind!"  
"你们这帮家伙在说什么呢？" 一个红头发的声音突然出现，吓得真治和健介从座位上跳了起来。"你们最好别在背后说我坏话！"

"Hi Asuka, here's your lunch," Shinji took out a gracefully packed-up bento box from his school bag. "It's a new recipe I found out recently."  
"嗨，明日香，这是你的午餐。" 真嗣从书包里拿出一个精心包装的便当盒。"这是我最近发现的新食谱。"

The redhead accepted the bento box with an appreciative smile; Kensuke and Toji raised their eyebrows. "Thanks," she added, eliciting increasingly confused looks from the two stooges.  
红发女孩带着感激的微笑接过便当盒； Kensuke 和 Toji 挑起了眉毛。“谢谢，”她补充道，这让两个跟班越来越困惑。

Their expression turned utterly horrified as Asuka sat down beside Shinji's spot, the routine seat for them.  
当 Asuka 坐在 Shinji 旁边的位置上时，他们的表情变得完全惊恐，那是他们惯常的座位。

"Why are _you_ sitting here, Soryu?!" Toji exclaimed in shock, starting to gather attention from their classmates. "This is _my_ spot!"  
“你为什么坐在这里，Soryu？！” Toji 震惊地喊道，开始引起同学们的注意。“这是我的座位！”

"What, I choose my own seat to eat, how is this any of you monkeys' business?" Asuka said back, though her hands didn't stop unpacking her dearest lunch. "Besides, you can just go eat with Hikari."  
“什么，我选个自己的座位吃饭，关你们这些猴子什么事？”明日香回嘴道，手上的动作却没停，继续拆着她最珍爱的午餐。“再说了，你们可以去找光吃饭啊。”

Toji choked and waved his hand viciously, declaring how he wanted nothing to do with the pigtailed dictator with red ears. "But…you usually eat with the class rep, why change now?" Kensuke asked in bewilderment, glancing at the said brunette, who was chatting with other girls.  
剑介被呛得直摆手，红着耳朵宣称自己绝不想和那个扎马尾的独裁者扯上关系。“但是…你通常不是和班长一起吃的吗，怎么现在改了？”真嗣困惑地问道，目光瞥向正在和其他女生聊天的棕发女孩。

"I…" Asuka pondered for a moment. While the school didn't know about their newly officialized relationship yet, she didn't exactly have a problem with her classmates knowing about it. In fact, she wanted to announce to the whole school that he was hers and she was his, elite EVA pilots who saved the city more than once.  
“我…”明日香沉思片刻。虽然学校还不知道他们新近确立的关系，但她并不介意同学们知晓。事实上，她想向全校宣布，他是她的，她是他的，他们是多次拯救城市的精英 EVA 驾驶员。

The only thing keeping her from revealing their in-love status was Misato's obliviousness, but now that they were exposed to her as well, she saw no reason to hold back anymore. "Well, Shinji's just a pleasantly enjoyable company. Do you have any problem with that?"  
唯一让她没有公开他们恋爱状态的原因是美里的一无所知，但现在他们也被她发现了，她觉得没有理由再隐瞒了。"嗯，真嗣只是个令人愉快的伴侣。你对此有什么问题吗？"

"Enjoyable company?" Muttering to himself, Toji blinked in confusion, still too dense to get the meaning behind the curtain.  
"愉快的伴侣？" 东治喃喃自语，困惑地眨了眨眼，仍然迟钝得无法理解幕后的含义。

Kensuke, on the other hand, had a dawning horror swept across his face. "Wait…are you…what exactly do you mean?"  
而另一边，健介的脸上逐渐浮现出惊恐之色。“等等……你是……你到底是什么意思？”

Asuka pouted. Are they seriously that oblivious? Just as she was about to shake it off and enjoy her lunch, from the corner of her eyes, she could see several girls looking in their direction – or more precisely, at Shinji, with promising looks.  
明日香撅起了嘴。他们真的那么迟钝吗？正当她准备抛开这些，享受午餐时，眼角余光瞥见几个女生正朝他们这边看过来——更确切地说，是盯着真嗣，脸上带着意味深长的表情。

She clenched her fists in irritation. As an elite EVA pilot and a great cook who made his own bentos as well as Ayanami's and Soryu's, he was considered a hot catch for girls in the school. Even though he had always been polite in declining their offers to have lunch together, his courtesy and mannerism only increased his prominence.  
她紧握双拳，感到一阵恼火。作为一名精英 EVA 驾驶员和一位出色的厨师，他不仅自己制作便当，还为绫波和惣流准备，因此在校园里被视为抢手的男生。尽管他总是礼貌地拒绝与她们共进午餐的邀请，但他的礼貌和举止反而增加了他的魅力。

Now it was Asuka's chance to claim him properly, in front of everyone.  
现在轮到明日香在众人面前正式宣称对他的所有权了。

"Of course he's the most enjoyable company here. He's my boyfriend, after all." She said it in a loud yet not disturbing volume, making sure people surrounding them could hear her demonstrative announcement.  
“当然，他在这里是最令人愉快的伙伴。毕竟，他是我男朋友。”她以一种响亮但不扰人的音量说道，确保周围的人都能听到她的宣示性声明。

Just as she expected, the whole class fell silent in an eye blink.  
正如她所料，整个班级在眨眼间陷入了沉默。

"What?" Asuka asked innocently. "Why making that face?" Seeing no reactions from her classmates whatsoever, she decided to take the more direct yet somewhat shameful approach.  
“什么？”明日香天真地问道，“为什么做那个表情？”看到同学们毫无反应，她决定采取更直接但有些羞耻的方法。

Before Shinji could even protest, he was pulled into a kiss. He wasn't going to resist, though. Asuka's forceful yet effective way of claiming him was no stranger to him, and he enjoyed it himself immensely.  
在真嗣还没来得及抗议之前，他就被拉入了一个吻。不过，他并不打算反抗。明日香那种强势却有效的方式宣告对他的占有，对他来说并不陌生，他自己也乐在其中。

The two of them quickly drowned into their own worlds to the extent the explosive chatter that rippled through the classroom didn't disturb them the slightest.  
两人很快沉浸在自己的世界里，以至于教室里此起彼伏的喧闹声丝毫没有打扰到他们。

After a minute or so, Asuka reluctantly pulled away from the kiss. "Any questions?"  
大约一分钟后，明日香不情愿地从亲吻中抽离。“有什么问题吗？”

"I thought I was joking about the married couple thing…" Toji, unable to close his mouth, mumbled in utter disbelief.  
“我以为我开玩笑说我们是夫妻的事…” 无法合上嘴的冬二喃喃自语，完全不敢相信。

"Man, the devil actually got you whipped…" Said Kensuke in shell shock.  
“天哪，你居然被那家伙制得服服帖帖……”健介震惊地说道。

In the distance, Asuka could see Hikari giving her a thumbs-up and a schoolgirl grin. She smiled back – if not for her - however unintentional - interference, Asuka wasn't sure if she could get what she had now.  
远处，明日香能看到光子向她竖起大拇指，脸上带着女学生的笑容。她也回以微笑——如果不是光子无意中的介入，明日香不确定自己是否能得到现在的一切。

The sound of footsteps on the grated floor of the catwalk echoed throughout the darkened hangar as Chairman Keel walked alongside Morthur Argan, the official representative of SEELE from the United States. His facial features definitely spoke about his abundant experience in political maneuvers.  
脚步声在昏暗的机库中回荡，主席基尔与来自美国的 SEELE 官方代表莫瑟·阿尔根并肩走在格栅地板的走道上。他的面部特征无疑透露出他在政治策略上的丰富经验。

Wasting no to arrive in Germany, aside from that the United States demanded explanations from Keel about his decision regarding his arrangement of Unit 04 - which could be done using telecommunication, he also wanted to inspect the development process of the MP EVAs, something the Committee held high expectations with.  
毫不拖延地抵达德国，除了美国要求基尔就其对 04 号机安排的决定给出解释——这可以通过电信方式进行，他还想亲自检查 MP EVA 的开发进程，委员会对此寄予厚望。

The United States, being a major financial and resource supporter of the construction of the MP EVAs as well as the operational expenditure of NERV in general, required good reasons to continue their funding that could be used on – say, infrastructure and medical system, instead of the money-blackhole that was Human Instrumentality Project.  
美国作为 MP EVAs 建设以及 NERV 整体运营支出的主要财务和资源支持者，需要充分的理由来继续其资助，这些资金本可以用于——比如基础设施和医疗系统，而非投入那个无底洞般的人类补完计划。

"So this is the…prototype of the EVA series?" Argan's eyes settled on the white behemoth in front of him. The outline resembled that of a human skeleton, save for the narrowed ribcage and the oddly shaped head. Argan traced his eyes over its featureless head, and even with a lack of aesthetic detail, he was still able to make out one telltale part of its visage that sent shivers down his spine. It had a sick, twisted smile.  
“所以这就是……EVA 系列的……原型机？”Argan 的目光落在了他面前的白色巨人身上。其轮廓类似于人类骨骼，除了收窄的胸腔和奇异的头形。Argan 的视线掠过其无特征的头部，尽管缺乏美学细节，他仍能辨认出那令人脊背发凉的面部特征——一个病态扭曲的微笑。

"Correct. Though, we've encountered…minor drawbacks. The S2 engine is still underdeveloped, and we'll require more money and resources to keep up with the schedule." Keel let out a sigh. Dr. Katsuragi's S theory, no matter how detailed, was still purely theoretical. Without a live sample of the S2 engine, Germany had a real hard time creating such a physics-law-breaking power source.  
“没错。不过，我们遇到了……一些小问题。S2 引擎仍处于未成熟阶段，我们需要更多的资金和资源来跟上进度。”Keel 叹了口气。Katsuragi 博士的 S 理论，无论多么详尽，终究只是理论。没有 S2 引擎的活体样本，德国在创造这种打破物理定律的动力源方面确实遇到了巨大困难。

Argan took another glance at the fearful appearance of the EVA before speaking up. "No offense, but I doubt the public opinion in America will favor such designs."  
阿甘又瞥了一眼 EVA 那令人畏惧的外观，然后开口道：“无意冒犯，但我怀疑美国公众的意见不会支持这样的设计。”

"Irrelevant." Keel snorted. "This has nothing to do with the public, anyway."  
“无关紧要。”基尔冷哼一声，“反正这与公众无关。”

"But we need the support of the House and the Senate!" Argan raised his volume, exasperated by Keel's lack of awareness of politics in the US. "If the voters don't buy it, no one in the Congress will stand by our side anymore! You can't seriously be oblivious to that, can you? People pay more taxes because we tell them only EVAs can beat the Angels, not to let you build these ugly machines!"  
“但我们需要众议院和参议院的支持！”阿甘提高了音量，对基尔对美国政治的无知感到恼火，“如果选民不买账，国会里就没人会站在我们这边了！你不会真的对此一无所知吧？人们多交税是因为我们告诉他们只有 EVA 能打败使徒，不是让你造这些丑陋的机器！”

Of course he was aware. Keel could be said as one of the most politically influenced people in the world. "That's why I told the Nevada Branch to transfer Unit 04 to Japan." Keel smirked as he saw the quizzical expression on Argan's face. Compared to Keel, Argan was still too young and naïve. "What are the EVAs for, ambassador?"  
"他当然清楚。可以说，基尔是世界上受政治影响最深的人之一。“所以我才让内华达支部把 04 号单位转移到日本。”基尔看到阿尔根脸上的困惑表情，不禁露出了一丝得意的笑容。与基尔相比，阿尔根还是太年轻、太天真了。“EVA 是用来做什么的，大使？””

"Like I said, to defeat the Angels?" Argan probed.  
“就像我说的，为了击败使徒？”Argan 试探性地问道。

Keel chuckled, shaking his head. "Their perceived use…could be different to their real use." He fixed his gaze on the terrifying mouth of the MP EVA Unit. "Say, after all of the Angels are defeated…what the public would think of the EVAs?"  
Keel 轻笑一声，摇了摇头。“他们所认为的用途……可能与实际用途大相径庭。”他凝视着 MP EVA 单位那令人胆寒的巨口。“比如说，在所有使徒都被击败之后……公众会如何看待 EVA 呢？”

Argan's mouth widened slightly as dawning realization hit him. He knew the end of the Angel Wars would be the Third Impact, but the public didn't. "So…we spread Japan threat theory, that they want more EVAs because Japan wants to wage wars against them after the Angel Wars? Then we raise our tax rate because we need more EVAs to defend ourselves?"  
Argan 的嘴角微微上扬，恍然大悟。他知道使徒战争的终结将是第三次冲击，但公众并不知情。“所以……我们散布日本威胁论，说他们想要更多 EVA 是因为日本想在使徒战争后对他们发动战争？然后我们提高税率，因为我们需要更多 EVA 来保卫自己？”

Keel nodded in satisfaction. "I'll leave the details to you."  
基尔满意地点点头。“细节就交给你处理了。”

**Chapter 27: A flap of a butterfly's wings…  
第 27 章：蝴蝶振翅……**

Matsushiro had always been a quiet place after the Second Impact since most of its residents fled the area, leaving the site abandoned and barren – a perfect trait for NERV to pick up and use as an advantage to build the testing facilities.  
松代在第二次冲击后一直是个安静的地方，大多数居民逃离了该地区，留下了废弃和荒凉的景象——这对 NERV 来说是一个完美的特征，可以利用并作为优势来建造测试设施。

Today the silence was broken by the roaring of engines of VTOLs and transport vehicles as the activation test of the most expensive, destructive, and technologically advanced war machine was imminent.  
今天，寂静被 VTOL 和运输车辆的引擎轰鸣声打破，因为最昂贵、最具破坏力且技术最先进的战争机器的激活测试即将开始。

"Is the pilot ready?" Dr. Mayumi, the temporary assistant technician for Ritsuko, looked over at one of the techs sitting next to her. Gendo Ikari had ordered Akagi to stay at NERV HQ for classified causes; she had no reasons to question him. "The pilot is ready." He answered with a professional calm voice.  
“驾驶员准备好了吗？”作为临时助理技术员的真由美博士，看向坐在她旁边的一位技术人员。源堂命令赤木留在了 NERV 总部，出于某些机密原因；她没有理由质疑他。“驾驶员已准备就绪。”他以专业的平静声音回答道。

"Alright." The doctor nodded, looking back at her terminal before doing one more check of Unit 04's system, ensuring that everything was ready for the activation test.  
“好的。”医生点头，回头看向她的终端，再次检查了 04 号机体的系统，确保一切就绪，准备进行激活测试。

"Begin activation." The technicians started to carry out their various tasks, monitoring the EVA Unit as it came online. Its yellow eyes lit up, and the sound of various machines in the observation room began to beep and chirp as they took in the readings from the Evangelion's performance.  
“开始激活。”技术人员们开始执行各自的任务，监控着 EVA 单位上线。它的黄色眼睛亮起，观察室内的各种机器开始发出哔哔和啾啾声，记录着福音战士的表现数据。

"Synch level is rising." The technician sitting next to Mayumi announced. "The pilot is approaching the borderline threshold."  
“同步率正在上升。”坐在真弓旁边的技术人员宣布，“驾驶员正接近临界阈值。”

Misato walked up next to Mayumi and peered over her shoulder, watching as the synchrograph began to align and the red bars indicating the pilot's synch ratio started to light up. Within seconds of passing the threshold, Unit 04 fully coming to life, and every single alarm in the Matsushiro testing facility began to blare.  
美里走到真由美旁边，探头看向她的肩膀，观察着同步图开始对齐，代表驾驶员同步率的红条开始亮起。仅仅几秒钟后，04 号机完全启动，松代测试设施内的每一个警报器都开始鸣响。

Misato started frantically looking around the observation room, trying to identify the problem, but when she looked back at Dr. Mayumi's terminal, it all became clear to her. The synchrograph began to drastically shift out of alignment, yet the Fourth Child's sync rate continued to rise.  
美里疯狂地环顾观察室，试图找出问题所在，但当她回头看向真由美博士的终端时，一切对她来说都变得清晰了。同步图开始急剧偏离对齐，然而第四适格者的同步率却持续上升。

"Cut connection! Abort the test!" Mayumi yelled, knowing how such a malfunction could lead to in theory.  
“切断连接！终止测试！”真由美大喊道，她深知这种故障在理论上可能导致何种后果。

"It's not shutting down!" Misato screamed as the giant robot pulled free from restraints. Unit 04's mouth restraints shattered into tiny little shards of metal, freeing its jaw and exposing its blocky red teeth. After that, everything went dark.  
"它没有停止运转！" 美里尖叫着，巨型机器人挣脱了束缚。04 号机的口部束缚碎裂成无数小金属片，解放了它的下颚，露出了方形的红色牙齿。随后，一切陷入了黑暗。

Before he could get the first syllable out, Asuka removed her towel and let it fall to the ground.  
在他能发出第一个音节之前，明日香解开了她的毛巾，任其掉落在地。

Shinji's eyes went wide. 真嗣的眼睛瞪大了。

"Shinji… today's the best birthday I've ever experienced…" Asuka leaned closer to him, purring into his face. She was naked as a jaybird, her slim body shined under the intense light of the living room. "Now…I want you."  
"真嗣……今天是我经历过的最棒的生日……" 明日香向他靠近，声音中带着撒娇。她一丝不挂，苗条的身体在客厅强烈的灯光下闪闪发光。"现在……我要你。"

It all came back to him. Their last time.  
这一切都回到了他的记忆中。他们的最后一次。

_"What did you say?!" Asuka pushed herself away from him.  
"你说什么？！" 明日香推开他，远离了几步。_

"You've made me happy…and I want you to be happy, too." Asuka put a hand on his rapidly rising and falling chest, the fire of lust growing increasingly intense with each passing second.  
"你让我感到快乐……我也希望你能快乐。" 明日香将手放在他急速起伏的胸膛上，欲望之火随着每一秒的流逝愈发强烈。

_"So I'm just her replacement?!" She rose from the bed.  
"所以我只是她的替代品？！" 她从床上起身。_

Looking directly into his cobalt eyes, Asuka started unbuttoning his shirt.  
直视着他那深邃的钴蓝色眼睛，明日香开始解开他的衬衫扣子。

_"Get away from me!" “离我远点！”_

Sliding up and down through his back, her other hand reached the hem of his underwear.  
她的另一只手在他背上滑动，最终触到了他内裤的边缘。

_"Get off my bed!" Asuka screamed.  
"从我床上滚下去！" 明日香尖叫道。_

She tore his shirt off.  
她撕掉了他的衬衫。

_"We're through, Shinji!" "我们完了，真嗣！"_

"Now…let me…" Asuka smiled a seductive smile and started applying force, her bare breasts pressed against his chest.  
"现在…让我…" 明日香露出诱人的微笑，开始施加力量，她赤裸的胸部紧贴着他的胸膛。

_"I HATE YOU!" "我恨你！"_

Shinji's eyes went unfocused.  
真嗣的眼神变得茫然。

Gasp.

No.

With a swift movement, Shinji grabbed both of Asuka's wrists and stopped them in tracks, eliciting a confused look from the redhead. "Shinji? What's wrong?"  
真嗣迅速地抓住了明日香的两只手腕，阻止了她的动作，这让红发的女孩露出了困惑的表情。“真嗣？怎么了？”

"I'm sorry, Asuka." "对不起，明日香。"

Her head shot up. "What?" Her tone wasn't necessarily angry, just profoundly bewildered.  
她猛地抬起头。“什么？”她的语气并非愤怒，只是极度困惑。

"Asuka, we need to stop," Shinji said, adding more firmness into his voice.  
"明日香，我们必须停下来，" 真嗣说道，语气中增添了几分坚定。

"Why?" Asuka probed, though she started to slowly disentangle herself from him. "I…bought some condoms yesterday in the mall, if that's what you're worried about." A blush crept up her face. "It was...humiliating. The cashier looked at me like I'm some slut who sleeps around. And I had to evade from Hikari's line of sight as well."  
“为什么？”明日香追问，同时开始慢慢从他身边挣脱。“我……昨天在商场买了一些避孕套，如果你担心的是这个。”她的脸颊泛起了红晕。“那真的很丢脸。收银员看我的眼神就像我是个随便和人上床的荡妇。而且我还得避开光子的视线。”

If the situation was not so grim, he would've chuckled at that confession. He just knew there was more to it that she insisted him not tug along with her. But now…  
如果情况不是那么严峻，他可能会对这个坦白轻笑出声。他只是知道她坚持不让他跟着她，背后还有更多隐情。但现在……

"It's not that…" Shinji couldn't meet her in the eyes, his composure breaking down. "It's…"  
“不是那样的…” 真嗣无法直视她的眼睛，他的镇定开始瓦解。“是…”

"Hey, Shinji," Asuka started in a soft voice. "You've told me this before…but now, this is different. **We** are different now. Now we're partners, boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm yours and you're mine. This is…this is what I want." She trailed off, still looking at Shinji intently.  
“嘿，真嗣，” 明日香用柔和的声音开始说道。“你以前告诉过我这些…但现在，情况不同了。我们现在不一样了。现在我们是搭档，男朋友和女朋友。我是你的，你也是我的。这就是…这就是我想要的。”她停顿了一下，仍然专注地看着真嗣。

"I know, Asuka. I just…" Releasing his grip on her wrists, Shinji couldn't help but let his eyes wandering left and right.  
“我知道，明日香。我只是……” 松开握住她手腕的手，真嗣忍不住左右张望。

Asuka's expression turned from confused to _hurt_ in an instant. "You…you don't want me." She pushed herself off him, her body starting to tremble. "You think I'm ugly…" Her voice, though she tried to make it as angry as possible, the pain still radiated from it.  
明日香的神情瞬间从困惑转为受伤。“你……你不想要我。”她从他身上撑起，身体开始颤抖。“你觉得我丑……”尽管她尽力让声音听起来尽可能愤怒，但痛苦依然从中透出。

"No, it's not like that Asuka!" Shinji hastily moved forward and tried to grab her hand again, though to no avail as Asuka stumbled back from him.  
“不，不是那样的，明日香！”真嗣急忙上前试图再次抓住她的手，但明日香踉跄后退，未能成功。

"You don't even want to look at me!" Asuka cried, a sob escaped from her throat.  
“你甚至不想看我一眼！”明日香哭喊着，一声呜咽从喉咙里逃出。

"Asuka!" Shinji exclaimed. "I want you, I really do! You're not ugly! To be honest, you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen!"  
"明日香！" 真嗣惊呼道，"我真的很想要你！你并不丑！说实话，你是我见过的最漂亮的女孩！"

"Then prove it," Asuka lowered her voice to a dangerous level.  
"那就证明给我看，" 明日香压低声音，带着一丝危险的气息说道。

"Asuka…listen carefully." Taking a deep breath, Shinji continued. "Your body…is perfect." Asuka raised an eyebrow. "But…we can't do it. Not now. I'm not…ready, yet."  
"Asuka…仔细听我说。" 深吸一口气，真嗣继续说道。"你的身体…非常完美。" 明日香挑了挑眉。"但是…我们不能这么做。现在不行。我…还没准备好。"

"How do I know that you really meant it?" She fixed a glare at him. It wasn't like she didn't trust him, but she just had so many doubts herself, worsened by the resurfacing memories of Shinji's unreal respect to her modesty.  
"我怎么知道你是真心的？" 她盯着他，目光锐利。并非她不信任他，只是她自己有太多疑虑，再加上真嗣对她矜持的过度尊重的记忆再次浮现，让她更加不安。

Fortunately, he had been preparing for this moment ever since that day Asuka almost lost control of herself. "I have one way," he carefully spoke. "Just wait for me here, okay?"  
幸运的是，自从那天明日香差点失控以来，他一直在为这一刻做准备。“我有办法，”他小心翼翼地说，“就在这里等我，好吗？”

"You promise not to run away?" Asuka asked with a note of threat in her voice.  
“你保证不逃跑吗？”明日香问道，声音中带着一丝威胁。

"Asuka…do you trust me?" Shinji straightened up.  
“明日香…你相信我吗？”真嗣挺直了身子。

After a momentary pause, her firm reply came. "Yeah. I do."  
短暂的停顿后，她坚定地回答道："是的，我愿意。"

With that, Shinji nodded at went to his room. Asuka tapped her bare foot on the floor in an increasingly faster rhythm, didn't make the slightest attempt to cover her nude self up, her glare so intense as if she was trying to burn a hole in the wall separating her from Shinji.  
说完，真嗣点了点头，走向自己的房间。明日香赤脚在地板上敲击着，节奏越来越快，丝毫没有遮掩自己裸体的意思，她的目光如炬，仿佛要将隔开她和真嗣的那堵墙烧穿一个洞。

Moments later, just before Asuka was about to burst into the closet herself, Shinji emerged from the door, a large white paper and several colored pencils in various colors in his hands. "What is it?" Asuka asked, her confusion returned.  
片刻之后，就在明日香即将冲进衣橱之际，真嗣从门口走了出来，手里拿着一张大白纸和几支各种颜色的彩色铅笔。“这是什么？”明日香问道，她的困惑再次浮现。

"I want to draw a portrait for you," Shinji smiled a cautious smile. "And I will stick it on the wall of our room. This way, I can-we can appreciate it every day when we wake up and go to bed."  
"我想为你画一幅肖像，" 真嗣带着谨慎的微笑说。"我会把它挂在我们的房间墙上。这样，我——我们每天醒来和睡觉时都能欣赏到它。"

Asuka bit down on her lower lip. The idea was new to her, there were doubts and insecurities. She felt she should be ashamed to let him do it, but considering what she had just asked him to do…  
明日香咬了咬下唇。这个想法对她来说是新鲜的，充满了疑虑和不安全感。她觉得自己应该为此感到羞愧，但考虑到她刚刚要求他做的事情……

"Pervert. Hmph, not a bad idea." Asuka's tensed muscles slowly started to relax. "Just…how?"  
"变态。哼，主意不错。" 明日香紧绷的肌肉慢慢放松下来。"只是……怎么画？"

Shinji let out a long silent sigh of relief, knowing he just defused a nuclear weapon with a yield several exponents higher than the Tsar Bomba. "Pick a gesture you like and try to keep still while I'm drawing. I promise it won't be too long."  
碇真嗣长长地松了一口气，他知道自己刚刚拆除了一枚威力比沙皇炸弹还要高出几个数量级的核弹。“选一个你喜欢的姿势，尽量保持不动，我画的时候不会太久的。”

"Fine." Asuka pulled out a chair from under the dining table and sat down, moving around and turning limbs as she tried to make a perfect pose worthy of the great Asuka Langley Soryu. "I think I'm ready." Came her flippant voice as she stopped moving.  
“好吧。”明日香从餐桌下拉出一把椅子坐下，扭动着四肢试图摆出一个配得上伟大明日香·兰格雷的完美姿势。“我想我准备好了。”她停下动作，漫不经心地开口。

"Um…your left hand, move that way a little…Right. Perfect." Shinji finished his instructions before picking up his pencils. The paper was put on the table, Shinji wasted no time and started making strokes using the pens.  
“嗯……你的左手，再往那边挪一点……对。完美。”真嗣说完指示后拿起铅笔。画纸放在桌上，真嗣毫不犹豫地开始用笔作画。

"Paint me like one of your French girls, Shinji." Asuka focused her eyes on his movements as Shinji spent all of his attention on the drawing. The soft rustling sound of the pen was amplified by the silence that loomed over the entire apartment. "You're not seeing tomorrow's sun if you dare to draw me ugly!"  
“把我画成你的法国女孩那样，真嗣。”明日香专注地盯着真嗣的动作，他全神贯注于绘画。笔尖轻擦纸面的沙沙声在笼罩整个公寓的寂静中被放大。“你要是敢把我画丑了，明天就别想见到太阳！”

Shinji…he looked so serious…and it only made him more attractive.  
真嗣……他看起来如此认真……这让他显得更加迷人。

As time passed, the redhead found it increasingly more difficult to ease the storm of thoughts raging through her mind. Since when, this boy she was fond of calling an idiot, became the only one that mattered to her?  
随着时间的流逝，红发女孩发现越来越难以平息脑海中肆虐的风暴。从何时起，这个她喜欢称之为笨蛋的男孩，成了她心中唯一重要的存在？

She had no idea. 她毫无头绪。

It wasn't that day he saved her from being boiled alive by the particle beam of the Sixth Angel.  
并非那一天他救她于第六使徒粒子束下的沸水之灾。

It wasn't that day he saved her life by bursting into her room, preventing her from suicide.  
也非那一天他破门而入，阻止了她自尽的念头。

Was it the day they talked in the bed, that she found out they were so alike that he could understand the pain she went through and emphasize with her? It was a major factor, but she was sure the feelings had already sprouted long before it.  
是在床上交谈的那天，她发现他们如此相似，他能理解她经历的痛苦并感同身受吗？这是一个重要因素，但她确信这些感情早已在此之前萌芽。

The day he admitted that he loved her more than anything else in the world? In retrospect, Asuka knew it was just the last straw, the final lethal crack on the dam that held back all of her emotions.  
是他承认他爱她胜过世界上任何其他事物的那天吗？回想起来，明日香知道那只是最后一根稻草，是阻挡她所有情感的堤坝上最后的致命裂缝。

Then what was it? 那么，究竟是什么呢？

Asuka's lips curled up into a small smile as she recalled all the time they've spent together. The laughter they shared, the occasional hand brushing, sitting on the roof together and watching the sunset, chatting about purposeless topics on their way to school, eating the delicious food he made for her…it was the mundane things in life, that slowly, gradually, melted the thick layers of ice around her heart.  
明日香回忆起他们共度的时光，嘴角微微上扬。他们共享的欢笑，偶尔的指尖触碰，一起坐在屋顶上看日落，上学路上闲聊无意义的话题，品尝他为她做的美味佳肴……正是这些平凡生活中的点滴，慢慢地、逐渐地融化了她心上厚厚的冰层。

When she was around him, she didn't feel alone anymore…  
当她在他身边时，她不再感到孤单……

When it was in front of him, only then would she willingly put down all of her pride…  
只有在他面前，她才会心甘情愿地放下所有的骄傲……

"Do you want me to draw…your private parts?" An abrupt question snapped Asuka from her train of thoughts. "Well, of course. I want you to appreciate me _fully,_" she replied, her blush intensifying as she spoke. "You're not missing a single detail, got that?"  
"你想让我画……你的私密部位吗？" 一个突如其来的问题打断了明日香的神思。"当然，我要你完全欣赏我，" 她回答道，脸颊上的红晕随着话语加深。"你可别漏掉任何一个细节，明白吗？"

"Sure." Shinji dove back into his ministrations. Since he had a lot of spare time to do things he wanted, after mastering German and self-defense combat skills, Shinji deemed drawing would be his next subject to learn.  
"当然。" 真嗣重新投入到他的工作中。自从掌握了德语和自卫格斗技能后，他有很多空闲时间去做自己想做的事，真嗣认为绘画将是他下一个要学习的课题。

He once had absolutely no talent in drawing, let alone human portraits, one of the most delicate areas of art. Still, no problem couldn't be solved with time. Years after years, cycles after cycles, he finally felt confident in his drawing skills after he could draw pictures of Unit 02 vivid enough to gratify the fiery redhead.  
他曾经完全没有绘画天赋，更别提人像这种艺术中最精细的领域了。然而，没有什么问题是时间解决不了的。年复一年，循环往复，他终于在能够生动地画出二号机并让那位火红发色的女孩满意后，对自己的绘画技巧感到自信。

It took him half an hour to complete his work of art. "Here, Asuka, I'm finished. You can move now and stretch your body."  
他花了半个小时才完成这件艺术品。“好了，明日香，我完成了。你现在可以动一动，伸展一下身体了。”

She wasn't going to follow his healthy suggestions, though, as Asuka leaped at Shinji from her seat and snatched the portrait from his hands, who had little reaction time to prepare himself against the assault.  
然而，她并不打算听从他的健康建议，明日香从座位上一跃而起，从真嗣手中夺过画像，后者几乎没有时间准备应对这次突袭。

Asuka went mouth agape after taking a careful examination of the drawing. She shined in full glory, even it was only 2-dimensional. From the top of her head to the bottom of her feet, every trace and detail – however minuscule - of her body she took pride in, was depicted with skill and care.  
明日香仔细审视了这幅画后，惊讶得合不拢嘴。她在画中光彩照人，尽管只是二维的。从头顶到脚尖，她引以为傲的身体的每一丝痕迹和细节——无论多么微小——都被巧妙而细致地描绘出来。

Her iconic red hair flowed down over her back, cut in halves by the shoulder blade. The sapphire eyes that made her stood out from the crowd, even though it was only in paint, still gleamed with fire and pride. The pink gracile lips together with her exquisite nose above them were positioned and drawn unblemished.  
她那标志性的红发如瀑布般垂落，被肩胛骨一分为二。那双蓝宝石般的眼睛让她在人群中脱颖而出，尽管只是画作，依然闪烁着热情与骄傲。粉嫩的柔唇与上方精致的鼻梁，位置与描绘都完美无瑕。

Then it came to her breasts – she had a subtle impression that Shinji had drawn them fuller than they actually were to appease her, but she wasn't going to complain. Her pink nipples stood up proudly; her slender waist was drawn just right.  
接着是她胸部——她隐约觉得真嗣将它们画得比实际更丰满，以取悦她，但她并不打算抱怨。粉嫩的乳头骄傲地挺立；纤细的腰身恰到好处。

Asuka felt her cheeks started heating up as she set her eyes on her nether parts of the portrait. Even though the _entrance of her womanhood_ was hidden behind her flatly lied legs, she could still vaguely make out the hair around it. Not to mention her slim, perfect long legs, her shapely bottom, her petite feet-  
当目光落在画中自己的私密部位时，明日香感到脸颊开始发热。尽管双腿平放遮住了她的私处，她仍能隐约看到周围的毛发。更不用说那修长完美的双腿、曲线优美的臀部、小巧的脚丫——

A perfection to behold. 完美无瑕。

"It's acceptable," Asuka remarked, though her words were contrasted by her non-stop swirling around the room in exuberance. "Mine!" The redhead held the painting in the air with utmost care like treating a cherished treasure; an idea flashed into her mind as she saw the empty space at the upper right corner of the paper.  
"还行吧，" 明日香说道，尽管她的言语与她不停在房间里欢快旋转的动作形成鲜明对比。"我的了！" 红发女孩小心翼翼地将画作举在空中，仿佛在对待一件珍贵的宝物；当她看到纸张右上角的空白处时，一个念头闪过她的脑海。

Asuka took her portrait the person she loved drew for her along with a marker pen into her room and shut the door close. Shinji sighed in both relief and amusement. Today could've gone better, but also could've gone considerably worse, if not-  
明日香带着她心爱的人为她画的肖像和一支马克笔走进房间，并紧紧关上了门。真嗣松了一口气，同时感到一丝好笑。今天本可以更好，但也可能糟糕得多，如果不是——

His phone rang. "Hello?" He picked up the phone.  
他的手机响了。"喂？" 他接起了电话。

"Shinji…report to NERV Headquarters immediately." Maya's shaky voice came through the microphone. "There was an explosion in Matsushiro…"  
“真嗣…立即前往 NERV 总部报到。”摩耶颤抖的声音从麦克风中传来，“松代发生了爆炸…”

The following words all became a blur to him as his brain went blank.  
接下来的话语对他来说都变得模糊不清，他的大脑一片空白。

XXXXXX

NERV Headquarters had gone from idle to full alert within the blink of an eye. It took no time for them to receive word of Unit 04's ballistic state, as well as the complete destruction of the testing facility in Matsushiro. There was no word on the casualties, but they did have a positive ID on the rogue Evangelion.  
NERV 总部在眨眼间从闲散转为全面警戒。他们很快收到了关于 04 号机弹道状态的消息，以及松代试验设施被彻底摧毁的情况。关于伤亡情况尚无消息，但他们确实确认了失控的福音战士身份。

"It's pattern orange." Hyuga spoke, looking up at the giant screen being projected in front of the Command Center's front deck, showing the black EVA Unit slowly trudging its way through the hilly countryside, making its way towards Tokyo-3. "We can't tell if it's an Angel or not."  
"这是橙色模式。" 日向说道，抬头看着指挥中心前甲板上投射的巨大屏幕，画面中黑色的 EVA 初号机正缓慢地穿越丘陵地带，向东京-3 前进。"我们无法判断它是否是使徒。"

"Eject the plug." Commander Ikari ordered. Narrowing his eyes, he couldn't help but feel confused by the occurrence. Indeed, one of the EVA Units was an Angel, but it should be Unit 03 like Shinji had told him, right?  
"弹出插入栓。" 碇司令命令道。他眯起眼睛，不禁对这一情况感到困惑。确实，其中一台 EVA 是使徒，但应该是像真嗣告诉他的，是 03 号机，对吧？

"Plug ejection failed, something blocked it from ejecting," Maya reported.  
"插入栓弹出失败，有什么东西阻止了它弹出，" 伊吹报告道。"

"Unfortunate." Gendo huffed, sitting in his office looking down the command deck. He couldn't turn back time; he had all three EVAs facing one, he was confident this would only be a minor annoyance. "Identify Unit 04 as the twelfth Angel. Destroy it at all costs." His voice cold and firm.  
“不幸。” 源渡哼了一声，坐在办公室里俯视着指挥甲板。他无法逆转时间；他让三台 EVA 面对一个敌人，自信这只会是个小麻烦。“将 04 号单位识别为第十二使徒。不惜一切代价摧毁它。”他的声音冷酷而坚定。

"But the pilots' still inside, and alive," Makoto said. "We can still pick up his vital signs, however weak. We should…"  
“但驾驶员还在里面，还活着，”真希波说。“我们仍能接收到他微弱的 vital signs。我们应该…”

"Irrelevant," Gendo snapped at him. Only the Second Child and his son had to be protected under all conditions. "Destroying the Angel is our primary concern. The pilots' life is out of consideration. That is an order."  
“无关紧要，”源渡厉声打断他。只有二号适格者和他的儿子必须在任何条件下得到保护。“摧毁使徒是我们的首要任务。驾驶员的生命不在考虑范围内。这是命令。”

Inside Unit 01, Shinji was grasping his control yokes tightly. In fact, with his strength, the yoke was begging to crack. How did this happen? Wasn't Unit 03 the one infested by the Angel? Even though he had good knowledge of how to defeat them, he had to admit that he never knew where the Angels came from.  
在初号机内部，真嗣紧紧握住操纵杆。实际上，以他的力量，操纵杆几乎要断裂。这一切是怎么发生的？不是三号机被使徒侵袭了吗？尽管他对如何击败使徒了如指掌，但他不得不承认，他从未知晓使徒的来历。

Standing beside him was Unit 02. Unit 00 stood farther away, holding a sniper rifle in its hands.  
站在他旁边的是二号机。零号机则站在更远的地方，手持狙击步枪。

"Shinji, what's going on?" Asuka opened the communication channel with Unit 01, her voice confused. "Where's the Angel we're supposed to slaughter?"  
"真嗣，发生什么事了？" 明日香打开与 01 号机的通讯频道，声音中带着困惑。"我们该消灭的那个使徒在哪里？"

"I don't have the visuals yet," Shinji replied. "Rei, any sign of the target yet?"  
"我还没看到图像，" 真嗣回答。"绫波，有目标的迹象吗？"

Rei's ghostly voice broke in. "I've found it." She spoke. "Look towards the sun."  
绫波那幽灵般的声音插了进来。"我找到了。" 她说。"看向太阳的方向。"

All pilots turned their EVAs towards the setting sun, where they could see a humanoid silhouette contrasted against the bright orange light of the sun. Its upper body was slumped forward, letting its arms dangling around its knees, and its steps were barely more than slow trudges.  
所有驾驶员都将他们的 EVA 转向落日方向，那里可以看到一个与明亮橙色阳光形成对比的人形轮廓。它的上半身前倾，手臂垂在膝盖周围，步伐几乎只是缓慢的拖行。

"Is that an Angel?" Asuka frowned. "Isn't that an EVA?"  
“那是使徒吗？”明日香皱眉。“那不是 EVA 吗？”

"It's ex-Unit 04, now possessed by an Angel," Maya's voice echoed inside their cockpits. "Your orders are to destroy it at all costs."  
“那是曾经的 04 号机，现在被使徒占据了，”玛雅的声音在他们驾驶舱内回响。“你们的命令是无论如何都要摧毁它。”

Asuka growled in irritation. "Of course the Fourth Child would fuck up!" She hissed. "And thanks to his fucking stupidity, my birthday is fucked up as well! I promise he's _not_ gonna walk away from this _whole_!"  
明日香恼怒地咆哮道：“当然，第四适格者会搞砸一切！”她低声咒骂，“都怪他的愚蠢，我的生日也泡汤了！我发誓，他别想轻易脱身！”

"How about Misato? Is she okay?" Shinji probed as he took a good look at the black EVA Unit. It had a design different from all of the EVAs he had seen before; some new technology and weapons were equipped, but he was confident that he could deal with it with grace, especially with Asuka behind him in battle.  
"那美里呢？她还好吗？" 真嗣一边仔细观察着黑色的 EVA 单位，一边试探性地问道。这个 EVA 的设计与他之前见过的所有 EVA 都不同；它装备了一些新技术和武器，但他自信能够优雅地应对，尤其是在战斗中有明日香在他身后支持。

"A medical team was sent to the explosion site."  
"一支医疗队被派往爆炸现场。"

"Well, that basically tells us nothing!" Asuka shouted into the microphone. "Shinji? Do we have a plan?"  
"好吧，这基本上什么都没告诉我们！" 明日香对着麦克风喊道。"真嗣？我们有计划吗？"

"Right," Shinji replied. "Asuka, you will flank its right side, I'll attack from the left. Ayanami, you're to provide suppressive fire, and distract the target when needed. Everyone clear?"  
"好的，" 真嗣回答。"明日香，你从右侧包抄，我从左侧进攻。绫波，你负责提供压制火力，并在需要时分散目标注意力。大家都清楚了吗？"

"Sounds like a plan!" "Roger."  
"听起来不错！" "明白。"

"Alright." Shinji gazed at the EVA intently. Saving Toji from the Unit 03 incident and let him came out intact wasn't necessarily an easy task to do, but with Asuka and Rei's help, it wasn't impossible, either. With all the experience he had, Shinji knew he could save the Fourth Child from suffering any significant damage, even though he…turned out to be a huge annoyance.  
"好吧。" 真嗣凝视着 EVA，从 03 号机事件中救出冬二并让他完好无损并非易事，但有明日香和绫波的帮助，也并非不可能。凭借他所积累的经验，真嗣知道他可以拯救第四适格者免受重大伤害，尽管他……最终变成了一个巨大的麻烦。

He wasn't afraid of him making moves on Rei or Asuka, at all. He knew who they were, and he had absolute confidence in them, and all of his former experiences only proved his idea true. What he was annoyed with was the Fourth Child could easily cause Asuka discomfort as she said, and that was unacceptable.  
他丝毫不担心他会向丽或明日香示好。他了解她们是谁，对她们有着绝对的信心，而他过去的所有经历只是证实了他的想法。让他恼火的是，第四适格者能轻易让明日香感到不适，正如她所说，这是不可接受的。

Still, he would try to save him. As long as he could help to fight against SEELE-  
尽管如此，他还是会尝试救他。只要他能帮助对抗 SEELE——

"Pilot Soryu's sync rate is spiking!"  
“惣流驾驶员的同步率正在飙升！”

His train of thoughts abruptly derailed as Asuka's video feed turned into white noise and snowflakes. He frowned. The infested EVA was still slowly walking toward them, then why? "Asuka? Asuka! Answer me!"  
他的思绪突然中断，因为明日香的视频信号变成了白噪音和雪花。他皱起眉头。被感染的 EVA 仍在缓慢向他们走来，那为什么？“明日香？明日香！回答我！”

"Unit 02 has gone silent!"  
“二号机失去联系了！”

Shinji felt his blood freeze as Makoto's panicked voice came to him from the speakers.  
真嗣感到血液仿佛凝固，从扬声器中传来了真希的惊慌声音。

"We've detected another high energy readings from within Unit 02! Pattern blue! It's an Angel!"  
"我们检测到 02 号机内部又有高能量读数！蓝色模式！是使徒！"

"Unit 02…reactivated..." "初号机…重新启动了…"

## *Chapter 28*: Chapter 28: storm raging  
*第 28 章*: 第 28 章：风暴肆虐

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

I have decided to take the darker approach to the plot.  
我决定采用更为阴暗的剧情走向。

**Chapter 29: …generates a raging storm across time-space  
第二十九章：…在时空之间掀起狂澜**

Asuka gripped the controls of her EVA tightly as she fumed. Today was her birthday, the first real one she had ever since her mother died. Even though her father and stepmother would send her small presents on her birthday, they only did it for the sake of doing it, and Asuka didn't feel the emotional attachment from them at all.  
明日香紧握着她的 EVA 操纵杆，心中怒火中烧。今天是她的生日，自从母亲去世后，这是她第一个真正意义上的生日。尽管父亲和继母会在生日时送她一些小礼物，但他们只是出于义务，明日香丝毫感受不到他们的情感联系。

However, today was different. She spent her birthday with someone who loved her, an enjoyable and trustable company, a person she truly cared about. Even though today almost went wrong – the general feeling was still there, not to mention the end result was beyond her expectations.  
然而，今天不同。她与一个真正爱她的人共度生日，一个愉快且值得信赖的伴侣，一个她真心在乎的人。尽管今天差点出错——但那种温馨的感觉依然存在，更不用说最终结果超出了她的预期。

And it just had to be interrupted.  
而这美好时刻偏偏被打断了。

For the first time in a long while, Asuka actually felt like feasting on someone's blood. And it had a specific name.  
时隔许久，明日香第一次真正感到想要吸食某人的血液。而且这个人还有个特定的名字。

"Of course the Fourth Child would fuck up!" Asuka growled. "And thanks to his fucking stupidity, my birthday is fucked up as well! I promise he's _not_ gonna walk away from this _whole_!"  
“当然，第四适格者会搞砸一切！”明日香咆哮道，“就因为他那该死的愚蠢，连我的生日都毁了！我发誓他绝不会轻易脱身！”

"How about Misato? Is she okay?" Shinji's voice came to her from the speakers. Asuka's killing intent subsided a little as worry started creeping into her mind. As hard as for her to admit, she still cared about Misato – who was never a decent guardian nor shining example.  
“那美里呢？她还好吗？”真嗣的声音从扬声器中传来。明日香的杀意稍稍减退，忧虑开始悄悄侵入她的心头。尽管难以承认，她依然关心美里——尽管她从未是个称职的监护人，也不是什么光辉的榜样。

"A medical team was sent to the explosion site."  
"一支医疗队被派往爆炸现场。"

"Well, that basically tells us nothing!" She huffed. Still, the Angel was a more imminent threat. "Shinji? Do we have a plan?"  
"好吧，这基本上什么都没告诉我们！" 她气呼呼地说。不过，使徒的威胁更为紧迫。"真嗣？我们有什么计划吗？"

"Right," Shinji replied. "Asuka, you will flank its right side, I'll attack from the left. Ayanami, you're to provide suppressive fire, and distract the target when needed. Everyone clear?"  
"好的，" 真嗣回答。"明日香，你从右侧包抄，我从左侧进攻。绫波，你负责提供压制火力，并在需要时分散目标注意力。大家都清楚了吗？"

"Sounds like a plan!" "Roger."  
"听起来不错！" "明白。"

Asuka smiled to herself. With Shinji supporting her and fighting alongside her, she felt she could overcome every obstacle in the world. "On your mark, Shinji." She spoke, but received no response.  
明日香暗自微笑。有真嗣支持她，与她并肩作战，她觉得自己能克服世界上的一切障碍。"各就各位，真嗣。"她开口说道，但没有得到回应。

Asuka narrowed her eyes. "What the hell?"  
明日香眯起眼睛。"搞什么鬼？"

Her entry plug went dark.  
她的插入栓陷入黑暗。

"I still have power, don't I?" She mumbled to herself.  
"我还有力量，不是吗？" 她喃喃自语。

The familiar sensations when she piloted the EVA, the pilot seat underneath her, her hands on the controls, the hum of the interface in her head – all were gone in an instant. Asuka started to feel like she was losing her footing as the sensations were replaced by falling down into a bottomless pit.  
当她驾驶 EVA 时那种熟悉的感觉，驾驶座在她身下，双手放在控制器上，脑海中界面的嗡嗡声——所有这些都在一瞬间消失了。明日香开始感到自己像是在失去立足点，这些感觉被坠入无底深渊所取代。

"What the fuck? What is going on? Shinji? Wondergirl? Hello?"  
"搞什么鬼？这是怎么回事？真嗣？绫波？有人吗？"

Then a voice rang in her head, making her blood run cold.  
随后，一个声音在她脑海中响起，令她血液凝固。

_I've helped you before…now it's your turn to help me.  
我之前帮过你……现在轮到你帮我了。_

XXXXXX

Shinji's mind went blank.  
真嗣的脑海一片空白。

The black EVA Unit 04 continued to pace slowly toward them, a broken setting sun framed behind it.  
黑色 EVA 初号机 04 继续缓缓向他们走来，破碎的夕阳在其背后映衬。

_Asuka… 明日香……_

_Ireul… 伊留尔…_

The crimson EVA Unit held its head high and roared, leaping into the sky and crashed down onto a surprised Unit 00. "Ah!" Rei's short, but undoubtedly pained cry echoed in Shinji's cockpit, though it did little to help to snap him out of his transfixed state.  
那台猩红的 EVA 初号机高昂着头咆哮着，一跃而起，猛然坠落在惊愕的零号机上。“啊！”绫波的呼声虽短促，却无疑透着痛楚，在真嗣的驾驶舱内回荡，尽管这声音对他的恍惚状态并无多大帮助。

"Unit 01! Shinji! Assist Unit 00!"  
“初号机！真嗣！支援零号机！”

It didn't register in his mind. Unit 01 remained motionless as Shinji found himself unable to do anything as if he was completely frozen. He had had nightmares like this before - of Asuka piloting Angel-infested Unit 03 - being able to consciously tell his body what to do, but his body itself was unable to respond. It was like being paralyzed.  
这在他的意识中并未留下痕迹。零壹号机静止不动，真嗣发现自己完全无法动弹，仿佛被彻底冻结。他曾做过这样的噩梦——明日香驾驶着被天使侵蚀的零叁号机——他能清醒地指挥身体，但身体却无法做出反应。就像瘫痪了一样。

Unit 02 raised its gigantic metal fist and slammed it onto Unit 00, producing a large dent on the frontal armor of the blue EVA Unit. Rei Ayanami hastily rolled aside just before the second punch landed, pulling out her prog knife from the shoulder pylon of Unit 00.  
零贰号机举起巨大的金属拳头，猛击零零号机，在蓝色 EVA 机体的正面装甲上留下了一个大凹痕。绫波零在第二拳落下前急忙侧滚避开，从零零号机的肩部支架上拔出了她的程序刀。

Meanwhile, Unit 04 finally made its move as it leaped into the air in an inhumane fashion that broke several physics laws in the process. Finally, the pain caused by Unit 04's thousands of tons of metal crashing against his EVA brought Shinji back to reality.  
与此同时，04 号机终于采取了行动，它以一种违反人性的方式跃入空中，过程中打破了多条物理定律。最终，04 号机数千吨金属撞击在他 EVA 上的痛苦让真嗣回到了现实。

"Ahhh!" Shinji groaned in pain, all of the turmoil in his head temporarily flushed away. He realized even without the assist from Unit 02 and Unit 00, he alone was enough to subdue Unit 04 and save its pilot by pulling out the entry plug.  
“啊！”真嗣痛苦地呻吟着，脑海中的所有纷乱暂时被冲刷一空。他意识到，即使没有 02 号机和 00 号机的协助，他一个人也足以制服 04 号机，并通过拔出插入栓来拯救其驾驶员。

He just needed to make sure Unit 02 and Asuka were safe.  
他只需要确保 02 号机和明日香的安全。

"Rei!" He barked into the microphone as he tried to push Unit 04 off him. "Help me hold back Unit 02! I'll deal with Unit 04!" He paused for a second and added in a slightly shaking voice. "And please protect her."  
“丽！”他对着麦克风吼道，试图将 04 号机从自己身上推开。“帮我牵制住 02 号机！我来处理 04 号机！”他顿了一下，声音略带颤抖地补充道。“还有，请保护她。”

"R-roger," Ayanami's confirmation came to him not long after. One advantage she had fighting a rogue EVA was weapons. Unit 02, though being the more advanced and combat-ready production type, with only its fists as weapons, was actually more or less holding an equal ground with the prototype EVA.  
“罗杰，”绫波不久后确认道。她在与失控 EVA 战斗时的一个优势是武器。虽然 02 号机作为更先进、更适应战斗的生产型号，仅凭拳头作为武器，实际上与原型 EVA 保持着大致的均势。

With a forceful push, Shinji get rid of the body lock Unit 04 was applying on him. Taking a glance at its back, he confirmed that the Fourth Child's entry plug was indeed half-ejected, blocked by core-like substances.  
借助一股强力推力，真嗣摆脱了 04 号机对他的身体束缚。他瞥了一眼其背部，确认第四适格者的插入栓确实半伸出，被核心状物质阻塞。

He needed to defeat Unit 04 fast, since Rei's pained cries were coming increasingly more often from the comm channel. "Just hold on a little longer, Rei!"  
他需要尽快击败 04 号机，因为从通讯频道中传来的绫波痛苦的呼喊越来越频繁。“再坚持一会儿，绫波！”

"I…I will try," Rei replied, struggling against the Angel-powered production type.  
“我……我会尽力，”丽回答，与天使动力的生产型机体奋力抗衡。

Unit 04 pounced at Unit 01 again; Shinji, with all the combat experience he had, jumped aside just in time to avoid the potentially lethal attack. However, as he was trying to regain his balance, a new long arm shot out from Unit 04's ribcage and held a firm grip on Unit 01's neck before Shinji could even react.  
初号机再次扑向零号机；真嗣凭借所有的战斗经验，及时跳开，避开了这致命一击。然而，正当他试图恢复平衡时，初号机肋骨间突然伸出一条长臂，紧紧抓住了零号机的脖子，真嗣甚至来不及反应。

_That was cheating!_ The words choked in his throat. Seconds later, before he could realize what was going on, he was lying against the hillside, his back in pain, his throat painfully squeezed.  
这简直是作弊！这些话卡在他的喉咙里。几秒钟后，在他意识到发生了什么之前，他就已经躺在山坡上，背部疼痛，喉咙被紧紧挤压。

With all four arms doing damage, Shinji soon lost his upper hand. He tried to push off the two arms that Unit 04 gripped on his throat, but soon its other two arms joined, making his attempt futile.  
四臂齐下，真嗣很快失去了优势。他试图推开初号机紧抓他喉咙的两条手臂，但很快另外两条手臂也加入了，使他的努力变得徒劳。

But he would still fight. If he didn't, Asuka would be dead again, and this time because of his unrevised plan to work with his father.  
但他依然会战斗。如果不这样做，明日香又会死去，而这次是因为他未经修正的与父亲合作的计划。

"Asuka…fight it!" “明日香……振作起来！”

Gendo Ikari watched the fight displayed on the big screen; cold sweat started forming on his forehead for the first time in a long while. Not that he was concerned about Angels breaching Central Dogma, but the fact that the Second Child's condition was unknown, and Shinji was still in Unit 01.  
碇源堂凝视着大屏幕上显示的战斗；久违的冷汗开始在他的额头上形成。并非因为他担心使徒入侵中央教条区，而是因为二号机的状况不明，而真嗣仍在初号机中。

He recalled what Shinji had told him just days before. Being too nervous about the whereabouts of Ireul, Shinji had found him and admitted the unexpected missing of the Angel of Terror. Even though Gendo had been tense as well, after hearing the Angel could be defeated by Dr. Akagi using only a keyboard, the tension slowly subsided.  
他回想起几天前真嗣对他说的话。因为过于紧张伊鲁尔的行踪，真嗣找到了他，坦白了恐怖天使意外失踪的情况。尽管碇源堂也同样紧张，但在得知赤木博士仅用键盘就能击败天使后，紧张气氛逐渐缓和。

Therefore, he had insisted on keeping Dr. Akagi at NERV HQ whenever possible, and that decision now turned out to be a brilliant one.  
因此，他坚持尽可能让赤木博士留在 NERV 总部，而这个决定现在看来极为明智。

"Dr. Akagi, what can you tell me about the condition of Unit 02?" Commander Ikari rose from his seat and came to the observation spot of the command deck, speaking down to the lower levels.  
“赤木博士，关于 02 号机的情况，你能告诉我些什么？”碇司令从座位上起身，走到指挥甲板的观察点，向下层说道。

"The Angel is trying to hack into the MAGI!" Ritsuko replied in a panicked voice. "It's transmitting viruses into our system through the connection between us and Unit 02!"  
“使徒正在试图入侵 MAGI 系统！”律子惊慌地回答，“它通过我们与 02 号机之间的连接，向我们的系统传输病毒！”

Gendo narrowed his eyes a bit. Just like how Shinji had told him, the Angel of Terror was an organic virus attempting to take over NERV Headquarters through MAGI. "Cut the connection, then."  
源堂微微眯起眼睛。正如真嗣告诉他的那样，恐怖天使是一种有机病毒，试图通过 MAGI 系统接管 NERV 总部。“切断连接。”

"We can't! It's already corrupted our communication system! It's also blocking us from Unit 02's side! We can't even send plug ejection signals!"  
“我们做不到！它已经破坏了我们的通信系统！还封锁了二号机的通讯！我们甚至无法发送弹射信号！”

"Condition of the pilot?"  
“驾驶员状况如何？”

"Vital signs stable. Though we don't know about the authenticity of it. The signals we receive could be false for all we know."  
“生命体征稳定。不过我们无法确定其真实性。我们所接收到的信号也可能是虚假的。”

Gendo let out a small sigh of relief. As long as the Second Child was alive, there was still hope.  
碇源堂轻轻舒了一口气。只要二号机驾驶员还活着，就还有希望。

Asuka couldn't know what was going on on the battlefield since all of her sensations didn't make sense to her. Her entry plug was flashing a kaleidoscope of colors as she tried to focus on her thoughts, recalling the emergency procedures suited for a malfunctioning EVA. None of them worked, though, as the voice kept invading her mind.  
明日香无法理解战场上的情况，因为她所有的感觉对她来说都毫无意义。她的插入栓闪烁着万花筒般的色彩，她试图集中思绪，回忆起适用于故障 EVA 的紧急程序。然而，这些程序无一奏效，因为那个声音不断侵扰着她的心智。

_Help me understand, Lilim!  
帮我理解，莉莉姆！_

The redhead frowned. She had heard this familiar phrase before…when inside the eleventh Angel, the giant 8-ball. Her college-level intelligent brain soon came to a conclusion that she was almost likely under the influence of another Angel.  
红发少女皱起了眉头。她曾听过这句熟悉的话……在第十一使徒，那个巨大的 8 号球体内。她那大学水平的聪明头脑很快得出了一个结论：她很可能受到了另一个使徒的影响。

_'I just can't catch a break, can I?'_ Asuka fumed. Why were the Angels so interested in human minds, anyway? "What do you want?!" She barked into the void. Having encountered and successfully defeated one of their kins by herself, Asuka was confident that she could handle this one just as easily.  
“我就不能有点好运吗？”明日香愤愤不平。为什么使徒对人类的心灵如此感兴趣？“你们到底想要什么？！”她对着虚空厉声喝问。独自遭遇并成功击败了同类中的一个，明日香自信能同样轻松地应对这个。

_Lilim…interesting creatures. Unfathomable.  
莉莉姆…有趣的生物。深不可测。_

Lilim? The word didn't register in her mind, but Asuka could very well guess it meant her, or at least her species – humans. "Of course, we're not single-minded like you! You'll never understand us!"  
莉莉姆？这个词在她脑海中没有留下痕迹，但明日香大致猜到它指的是她，或者至少是她的种族——人类。“当然，我们不像你们那样单一思维！你们永远无法理解我们！”

Asuka was expecting the Angel to create another illusion of herself, but soon found herself wrong as a wave of unpleasant sensations assaulted her. It was mixed with pain, itch, and growing hotness. "Ahhhh!" She screamed in agony.  
明日香本以为天使会再次制造自己的幻象，但很快发现自己错了，一波不愉快的感受袭来。伴随着疼痛、瘙痒和逐渐加剧的热感。“啊！”她痛苦地尖叫起来。

_Surrender, help me, or be annihilated.  
投降，帮我，否则就毁灭吧。_

"I will n-" Asuka stopped herself. Being headstrong when her entire body was under the Angel's control didn't sound like a good idea. She knew Shinji was just beside her when it all came crashing down, and she trusted him to save her, knowing his combat experience and skills. Therefore, mopping around and evading crucial subjects to buy time for Shinji and wondergirl became her priority. "I can't help you if I don't know what you want!"  
"我会..." 明日香突然打住。在全身被使徒控制的情况下还逞强，听起来并不明智。她知道真嗣就在她身边，当一切崩溃时，她相信他能救她，知道他的战斗经验和技能。因此，四处游荡回避关键话题，为真嗣和那个女孩争取时间成了她的首要任务。"如果你不告诉我你想要什么，我帮不了你！"

_I want to understand you.  
我想了解你。_

"How?" Asuka intentionally stretched her voice.  
"怎么了解？" 明日香故意拉长声音问道。

_Help me, or suffer! 帮我，否则后果自负！_

_'Oh? Getting impatient already?'_ Asuka thought with amusement. "Like I said, I can't help you when I have no idea what you want from me!"  
'哦？已经开始不耐烦了吗？' 明日香带着一丝戏谑想道。"就像我说的，你什么都不告诉我，我怎么帮你！"

_HELP ME UNDERSTAND! 帮我理解！_

Asuka grinned. This was perfect. Apparently, the Angel, being single-minded creatures, had just fallen into and being trapped in an endless cycle. This way, she would stall long enough for Shinji to defeat the Angels and save her like the damsel in distress.  
明日香咧嘴一笑。这简直是完美的机会。显然，天使这种单细胞生物，已经陷入了无尽的循环中。这样一来，她就能拖延足够长的时间，让真嗣击败天使，像拯救落难少女一样来救她。

Suddenly her vision of the entry plug twisted as if the Angel was struggling with something. She could feel her EVA stopped abruptly from what it was doing before and roared.  
突然间，插入栓内的视野扭曲起来，仿佛使徒在与什么东西挣扎。她能感觉到她的 EVA 突然停止了之前的行为，并发出了咆哮。

It was a bone-chilling roar that went straight into her soul.  
那是一种直击灵魂的、令人毛骨悚然的咆哮。

_Poor Lilim…your tricks won't work against me. Not good enough.  
可怜的人类……你的伎俩对我无效。还不够好。_

Even though the voice said it, Asuka could still feel…exhaustion from it, as if the Angel had just survived a lethal attack. "Not so strong now, huh?" She mocked. "Just you wait, you sick fuck! He will come and save me!"  
尽管那声音如此说道，但明日香仍能感受到……来自它的疲惫，仿佛那使徒刚从致命攻击中幸存。“现在不那么强了吧？”她嘲讽道，“等着瞧吧，你这变态！他会来救我的！”

She felt a chill ran down her spine as the voice sounded again, this time much colder and more resounding.  
当那声音再次响起时，她感到一股寒意沿着脊背直窜而下，这次更加冷酷且响亮。

_The old-fashioned way, it is.  
还是老一套，是吧。_

"Wha-" Before she could even get the word out, her vision went black.  
"什——" 她话还没说完，眼前便一片漆黑。

"Thanks, mother." Ritsuko mumbled to herself as she stormed over her keyboard. The small confined area she was sitting in was stuffed with notes and brain-like electronic routes, the core of Casper, the woman identity of MAGI supercomputer, where her mother was residing in.  
"谢谢，妈妈。" 律子喃喃自语，手指在键盘上飞快敲击。她所坐的小小空间里，堆满了笔记和脑状电子线路，这里是卡斯帕的核心，MAGI 超级计算机的人格化身，她的母亲就栖身于此。

Melchior was already taken over while Balthasar was half-hacked.  
梅尔基奥尔已被完全控制，而巴尔萨泽则被半数破解。

Gendo Ikari paced back and forth on the observation deck, contrasting the calm composure of Sub-commander Fuyutsuki standing beside him. He could only hope the method Shinji told him would work on the Angel since this time it possessed an EVA that's attacking one of theirs viciously while continuing to hack into the MAGI.  
碇源堂在观察甲板上踱来踱去，与站在他身旁冷静沉着的副司令冬月形成鲜明对比。他只能寄希望于真嗣告诉他的方法能对使徒奏效，因为这次使徒操控着一台 EVA，正凶猛地攻击他们中的一员，同时不断侵入 MAGI 系统。

Most importantly, he wanted the Second Child to be safe.  
最重要的是，他希望二号适格者能安全无恙。

"Let's see if this works. If only Balthasar is faster than the Angel." Ritsuko uploaded the code onto Balthasar – her persona as a mother – and the part of the supercomputer promptly started calculating.  
"看看这招管不管用。要是巴尔萨泽能比使徒更快就好了。" 律子将代码上传至巴尔萨泽——她作为母亲的人格——超级计算机的那部分立刻开始运算。

On the battlefield, the crimson EVA Unit jerked to a stop just before it was about to land a deadly strike on the head of Unit 00. Rei Ayanami utilized this time and rolled away from the production type and entered an offensive position.  
战场上，赤红的 EVA 初号机猛地一顿，就在即将对零号机的头部施以致命一击之际停了下来。绫波零利用这片刻，迅速滚离量产机型，进入攻击姿态。

Though it didn't last long. The red EVA held its head back and roared a bone-chilling roar once more, the high-pitched sound shattered hundreds of pieces of glasses of the buildings around the area. Unit 00 was knocked down once again as Unit 02 expanded its AT-Field in an explosive manner, ripping the surface off the earth.  
然而这并未持续太久。红色 EVA 仰头再次发出令人毛骨悚然的咆哮，那尖锐的声波震碎了周边建筑数百扇玻璃。零号机再次被击倒，二号机则以爆炸性的方式扩张其 AT 力场，撕裂了地表。

"Balthasar wasn't fast enough?!" Incredulity radiated from Ritsuko's exclamation. Showing on her terminal, Balthasar was being taken over by the virus at lightning-speed. After all, Balthasar and Melchior were only machines. Her last hope would be Casper, the only one of the three that was part human.  
"巴尔萨泽不够快吗？！" 丽素的话语中透出难以置信。她的终端上显示，巴尔萨泽正以闪电般的速度被病毒侵占。毕竟，巴尔萨泽和梅尔基奥尔只是机器。她最后的希望寄托在卡斯帕身上，他是三者中唯一拥有人类部分的。

"I'm counting on you, mother!" The blonde doctor changed the primary computer to Casper. In the meantime, Balthasar was wholly occupied by the virus.  
"全靠你了，母亲！" 金发医生将主计算机切换至卡斯帕。与此同时，巴尔萨泽已完全被病毒占据。

"The Angel's going to self-destruct NERV Headquarters!" Aoba exclaimed, his voice slightly trembling. "Balthasar and Melchior had already consented! The virus is attacking Casper right now!"  
"使徒要自毁 NERV 总部！" 青叶的声音微微颤抖，"巴尔萨泽和梅尔基奥尔已经同意了！病毒正在攻击卡斯帕！

"Use firewalls to impede its assaults! Buy me some time!"  
“用防火墙阻挡它的攻击！为我争取时间！”

"On it! But the effect is not obvious!"  
"这就来！但效果不明显！"

Ritsuko silently cursed. Time was running out. On the big screen, she could see Unit 01 was struggling against Unit 04 as the former EVA was being held against a hill, its throat strangled. Unit 00 wasn't in good shape, either.  
律子默默咒骂。时间紧迫。在大屏幕上，她看到零号机正与四号机搏斗，前者被压制在山坡上，喉咙被扼住。零号机的状况也不容乐观。

"Pilot Ikari's sync rate is unstable! His heart rate is skyrocketing!"  
"碇司令的同步率不稳定！他的心率正在飙升！"

"Lower his sync rate to forty percent," Gendo ordered.  
“将他的同步率降到百分之四十，”碇源堂命令道。

"Pilot Ayanami's vitals aren't stable, either!" Aoba continued to report. "Pilot Soryu…wait."  
“绫波零驾驶员的生命体征也不稳定！”青叶继续报告，“明日香驾驶员……等等。”

Gendo raised an eyebrow. "What's her condition?" He probed, tension injecting into his voice.  
碇源堂扬起眉毛，“她的状况如何？”他追问，声音中透出紧张。

"Her vital signs have gone flat." Maya continued from where Aoba left off. "No heartbeat, no breathing, no brainwaves. Nothing."  
“她的生命体征已经消失。”真希波接着青叶的话继续说道，“没有心跳，没有呼吸，没有脑电波。什么都没有。”

No.

Gendo felt his blood freeze.  
源堂感到血液仿佛凝固了。

"Wh-what's Asuka's status?" Shinji's struggling voice floated from the speakers. Before Gendo could get his first syllable out, Maya replied.  
“那、那明日香的情况呢？”真嗣颤抖的声音从扬声器中传来。源堂还没来得及发出第一个音节，真希波就回答了。

"Shinji… she's gone." "真嗣…她走了。"

The pilot of Unit 01 was constantly distracted by the fight that was going on between Unit 00 and Unit 02, thus being overpowered by Unit 04. He could see Unit 02 expand its AT-Field and sent Unit 00 flying away. If he continued to waste more time on Unit 04, sooner than later he would have to face the attack of both EVAs at once, and the fact that Asuka was in one of them only made the situation grimmer.  
01 号机驾驶员因 00 号机与 02 号机之间的战斗而分心，被 04 号机压制。他看到 02 号机展开 AT 力场，将 00 号机击飞。如果他继续在 04 号机上浪费时间，迟早要同时面对两台 EVA 的攻击，而明日香在其中一台上，这使得局势更加严峻。

Shinji mustered all of his strength, pushing the Angel-infested EVA away from him by a minuscule amount, though it was enough for him to catch a breath. "Wh-what's Asuka's status?" He spoke into the microphone, hoping that she would still be okay.  
真嗣用尽全力，将感染了使徒的 EVA 稍稍推开，虽然只是微不足道的距离，但足以让他喘口气。“明日香的情况怎么样？”他对着麦克风说道，希望她还能安然无恙。

"Shinji… she's gone." "真嗣…她走了。"

He couldn't believe what his brain told him what he had heard. "Gone? What the hell do you mean by 'gone?!'" He shouted. Utilizing his moment of distraction, Unit 04 tightened its grip on Unit 01's throat, effectively subduing the purple mech once again.  
他无法相信自己的大脑告诉他他所听到的话。"消失？你说的'消失'到底是什么意思？！"他大喊道。利用这一瞬间的分神，04 号机加强了对 01 号机喉咙的握力，有效地再次制服了紫色机甲。

"Her vitals are all flat… we're getting nothing."  
"她的生命体征全都没了……我们什么也检测不到。"

"She's… Asuka's…" "她是……明日香的……"

_"Shinji-kun! Unit 02…Asuka…Asuka's…"  
"真嗣君！二号机……明日香……明日香的……"_

_"But…I can't do anything…"  
"但是…我什么都做不了…"_

He didn't need to hear the last word. Maya's tone was more than familiar to him. Though this time wouldn't like to be the first time.  
他不需要听到最后一个字。真嗣的语气对他来说再熟悉不过了。尽管这次不想成为第一次。

There's nothing else in this world that mattered to him anymore.  
这个世界上再也没有什么对他来说重要了。

Rage.

Pain.

Like a giant tsunami, the towering rage flushed all of his insecurities and hesitations away in an instant. Only one thing remained in his mind – the desire to revenge and cause destruction.  
如同巨大的海啸，那高耸的愤怒瞬间冲刷掉了他所有的疑虑和犹豫。他的心中只剩下一件事——复仇和毁灭的欲望。

"Pilot Ikari…his sync rate is spiking! Bordering on two hundred percent!"  
"碇真嗣驾驶员…他的同步率正在飙升！接近两百个百分点！"

On the surface, Unit 01 roared.  
表面上，初号机咆哮着。

Asuka found herself engulfed inside complete darkness, even deeper than the time when she was absorbed inside Leliel. She tried to feel her limbs and move around, but she couldn't, as if they didn't even exist.  
明日香发现自己被完全的黑暗吞没，比她被吸入雷里尔时还要深。她试图感知自己的四肢并移动，但却动弹不得，仿佛它们根本不存在。

She couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't feel. Her consciousness was the only thing that remained.  
她看不见，听不到，感觉不到。唯有意识残留。

_'What is this place?'_ She tried to speak out the words, but found herself unable to since she lost control of her vocal cord – or more precisely, she simply didn't have a vocal cord anymore.  
“这是什么地方？”她试图说出这些话，却发现无法发声，因为她失去了对声带的控制——或者更确切地说，她已经没有了声带。

_'Is this the end? Where people go when they die?'_ The disturbing thoughts remained in her mind. _'Shinji…I need you…'_  
“这就是终点吗？人们死后会去的地方？”这些令人不安的想法萦绕在她心头。“真嗣……我需要你……”

Then the assaulting voice reached her once more.  
随后，那个侵扰的声音再次传入她的耳中。

_He won't come for you if he thinks you're dead.  
如果他认为你已经死了，他就不会来找你了。_

_Now...I have you all by myself.  
现在...我终于可以独自拥有你了。_

Shinji twisted the armored hands of his attacker as he forced them away while crushing with all of his might.  
真嗣扭动着攻击者的装甲手臂，竭尽全力将它们推开并碾压。

A sickening crunch of broken bones and torn tissue brought a bitter smile to his face. If this world was also doomed, he didn't need to care about collateral damage anymore. With Unit 01's hands now free, Shinji made a vicious swing at the EVA Unit in front of him. Unit 01's AT-Field shattered Unit 04's like breaking substandard glass, and tore the remained arms off without so much as struggling.  
一阵令人作呕的骨头断裂与组织撕裂声，让他脸上浮现出一抹苦涩的微笑。如果这个世界也注定毁灭，他便不再需要顾及附带损害了。随着初号机双手的解放，真嗣对眼前的 EVA 单位发起了猛烈的攻击。初号机的 AT 力场如同击碎劣质玻璃般粉碎了四号机的 AT 力场，并轻而易举地撕裂了其剩余的手臂。

A part of him refused to believe that Asuka's gone, but was overwhelmed by the yankering to destroy, the torrent of anger, and by his desire for vengeance.  
他的一部分拒绝相信明日香已经离去，但被毁灭的渴望、愤怒的洪流以及复仇的欲望所淹没。

Cracking a distorted grin, Shinji grabbed his opponent by its throat.  
真嗣扭曲地咧嘴一笑，抓住对手的喉咙。

Then came a loud sound of crack that could be heard from miles away.  
随后，一声震耳欲聋的破裂声响彻数英里之外。

Shinji threw the now-limp form of Unit 04 on the hillside, and started an absolute slaughter. The former Evangelion's ichor was spraying on Unit 01 and everything around it in the radius of hundreds of meters, leaving long streaks and abstract blotches that looked like mad performance art.  
真嗣将已经瘫软的 04 号机扔在山坡上，随即展开了一场彻底的屠杀。前使徒的血液在 01 号机及周围数百米的范围内喷洒，留下长长的痕迹和抽象的斑点，宛如疯狂的行为艺术。

He didn't care about anything anymore. Not the condition of the Fourth Child. Not how NERV people would view him after this battle. Because this would be his last performance for this world.  
他不再关心任何事。不在乎第四适格者的状况，也不在乎 NERV 的人在这场战斗后会如何看待他。因为这将是在这个世界上的最后一次表演。

Unit 04 tried to fight back using its regrown limbs, but they were torn off within seconds of their reemergence. With a forceful punch, Unit 04's head was crushed into a bloody pulp.  
04 号机试图用新生的肢体反击，但它们在重新出现后的几秒钟内就被撕裂。一记重拳，04 号机的头部被砸成了一滩血肉模糊的浆糊。

"We've lost the signal of Unit 04's entry plug and the Fourth Child…" Maya reported, shaking violently after Unit 01 delivered a vicious stomp onto the core of Unit 04, flattening its chest and everything beneath it.  
“我们已经失去了 04 号机插入栓和第四适格者的信号……” 美里报告道，颤抖不已，因为 01 号机对 04 号机的核心部位施以猛烈一踏，将其胸腔及下方一切碾压得粉碎。

In the distance, Unit 00 finally lost the fight against Unit 02. Though it didn't matter anymore.  
远处，00 号机最终在与 02 号机的战斗中败下阵来。尽管这一切已无关紧要。

Unit 01 fixed its gaze at the supervision camera so people on the command deck would look at its glowing eyes directly.  
初号机凝视着监控摄像头，让指挥舱内的人们直接对上它闪烁的目光。

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

His tone made people in the command center shiver in dread, despite being temporarily desensitized by observing the recent brutal slaughter. It was the voice of a man who had nothing left to lose.  
他的语气让指挥中心的人们不寒而栗，尽管他们因目睹近期的残酷屠杀而暂时变得麻木。这是一个一无所有之人的声音。

Gendo felt his knees wobble. Was he apologizing to him? To people in NERV who were observing the battle?  
碇感到自己的膝盖在颤抖。他是在向他道歉吗？向 NERV 中观察战斗的人们？

To the world? 向世界？

No. His eyes went wide as the realization struck him. Shinji was only apologizing to the Second Child.  
不。他的眼睛因这一领悟而睁大。真嗣只是在向二号适格者道歉。

Gendo could see Unit 01 started to rise from the ground.  
碇源堂能看到初号机开始从地面升起。

He felt a new feeling that he had never felt before. It was a reflex of running away from something. A primal desire to flee. It was-  
他感受到了一种前所未有的感觉。那是一种逃跑的本能反应。一种原始的逃避欲望。那是——

Fear.

He didn't like the feeling. At all.  
他一点也不喜欢这种感觉。

Nothing else mattered to him anymore. Shinji's voice was cold, devoid of any feeling, empty of any emotion.  
对他来说，什么都不再重要了。真嗣的声音冰冷，毫无感情，空洞无物。

He could've just killed himself instead of starting the Third Impact, it would still send him to another cycle – however, without him and Asuka, sooner than later, the Angels would definitely defeat NERV and start Third Impact on their own.  
他本可以简单地自杀，而不是引发第三次冲击，那样他仍会进入下一个循环——然而，没有他和明日香，天使们迟早会击败 NERV 并自行引发第三次冲击。

Therefore, making it quick and painless was the last mercy he had for people in this world.  
因此，让他快速而无痛苦地结束，是他对这个世界上的人们最后的仁慈。

Despite the ground beneath her started to shake, Dr. Akagi paid no mind to it and continued to punch command lines into her terminal. Casper was her last hope.  
尽管地面开始震动，赤木律子博士对此置若罔闻，继续在终端上敲击命令行。卡斯帕是她最后的希望。

"Now!" With a forceful stroke on the ENTER key, kilobytes of codes were uploaded into Casper. The virus at first accepted the codes without thinking, though soon found itself in trouble. As it followed the codes, under its supernatural computing power, within milliseconds, its path of evolution came to an abrupt end.  
“现在！”随着用力敲下 ENTER 键，数千字节的代码被上传到卡斯帕。病毒起初不假思索地接受了这些代码，但很快发现自己陷入了困境。在其超自然的计算能力下，仅用毫秒时间，它的进化路径便戛然而止。

Sensing the danger, Ireul tried to overpower the computer that dared to compete with it. Though soon it found itself wrong since Casper wasn't only computing, it was also thinking, adapting – it was always one step ahead of the virus.  
察觉到危险，伊留尔试图压倒那台胆敢与它竞争的计算机。但很快它发现自己错了，因为卡斯帕不仅在计算，它还在思考、适应——它总是比病毒领先一步。

Knowing its performance was coming to an end, Ireul quickly retreated to the last place where it had pieces of itself.  
意识到自己的表演即将结束，Ireul 迅速撤退到最后一个藏有自己碎片的地方。

"Both Pattern blue eliminated!" Maya's eyes went wide - if that was even possible after observing the brutal scene Unit 01 was making - as she saw Unit 02's readings returned to normal. "I've got a signal! It's Asuka's vitals! Pilot Soryu is still alive!"  
“两台蓝色图谱都被消灭了！”玛雅的眼睛瞪得大大的——尽管在目睹零号机制造的残酷场面后这几乎不可能——当她看到二号机的读数恢复正常时。“我收到了信号！是明日香的生理数据！飞行员惣流还活着！”

Unit 01 stopped abruptly, the joints crackling from the sudden deceleration as it fell back to the ground. Turning on the spot with a worrying squeal, Shinji raced back, dropped Unit 01 to its knees next to the limp and mildly damaged form of Unit 02.  
初号机突然停下，关节因急停而发出噼啪声，随后重重地摔回地面。在一阵令人担忧的吱嘎声中，真嗣转身疾驰，将初号机跪倒在二号机那瘫软且轻微受损的机体旁。

With a punch on the emergency eject button, the entry plug of Unit 02 popped out, spraying out its LCL through the emergency vents. Shinji lifted the pod with the utmost care, breaking into a ground-shaking sprint the second it was secure in his hands. "Wounded incoming, heading to-" he summoned the map quickly. "Retrieval point E-17."  
随着一拳砸在紧急弹射按钮上，02 号机的插入栓弹射而出，LCL 液体通过紧急通风口喷涌而出。真嗣小心翼翼地抬起舱体，一旦确认安全便立刻开始狂奔，地面为之震动。“伤员正在前往——”他迅速调出地图，“回收点 E-17。”

"Acknowledged," Makoto responded just after snapping out of his earlier transfixes state, frantically punching commands into the terminal.  
“收到，”真希波刚从之前的恍惚状态中回过神来，急忙在终端上输入指令。

"Wait! Send the entry plug down to shaft L-03! Enact Angel-level quarantine procedures! No one does anything until I arrive!" Dr. Akagi - who had just came back from the CPU chamber of MAGI - maintained a note of professionalism in her hurried voice, then hastily left the command deck, heading to the elevators.  
“等等！将插入栓送至 L-03 号井！启动天使级隔离程序！在我到达之前，任何人不得擅自行动！”赤木律子博士刚从 MAGI 的 CPU 室返回，尽管语速匆忙，仍保持着专业口吻，随即匆匆离开指挥甲板，前往电梯。

Gendo let out a long relieved sigh before falling down onto his chair on the observational deck above the command level. Professor Fuyutsuki let out a heavy sigh. "Well, look on the bright side, Ikari. We didn't lose both pilots."  
源堂长舒一口气，随后瘫坐在指挥层上方的观察甲板椅子上。冬月教授沉重地叹息道：“唉，往好处想，碇。我们至少没有失去两位驾驶员。”

"Perhaps," Gendo huffed. Kozo didn't know what he was about to lose, at all. "The scenario…is adaptable. The old men will certainly be demanding explanations." He added, though he tried to sound impassionate, dread still flew out from his voice.  
“或许吧，”源渡哼了一声。荒巻完全不知道自己即将失去什么。“这个计划……是可以调整的。那些老家伙肯定会要求解释。”他补充道，尽管试图保持冷静，但声音中仍透露出恐惧。

"Ritsuko-san, where is Asuka?! Is she alright?" Shinji's storm of inquiries swept through the hallway of the Medical Wing. It had been several hours after the battle against the twelfth and thirteenth Angel, designated Bardiel and Ireul.  
“律子小姐，明日香在哪里？！她还好吗？” 真嗣一连串的询问在医疗翼的走廊上回荡。距离与第十二、第十三使徒，巴迪尔和伊鲁尔的战斗已经过去了几个小时。

His first destination was, no doubt, Ward 303 in the First Cranial Nerves section. He didn't know what the difference between Bardiel and Ireul in terms of influences on pilots was, but judging from the fact that her entry plug was still intact when the Angel was eliminated, his hopes were high.  
他的第一站无疑是第一脑神经区的 303 病房。他不清楚巴迪尔和伊鲁尔对驾驶员的影响有何不同，但从使徒被消灭时她的插入栓仍完好无损这一事实来看，他的希望很大。

But why Dr. Akagi kept avoiding the question?  
但为什么赤木博士一直在回避这个问题呢？

He had met the blonde doctor when he was literally ravaging across the Medical Wing when Ritsuko coincidentally came out of an elevator that led down to Central Dogma. Shinji hadn't stopped his brutal assault on the doctor yet ever since.  
他在医疗翼肆虐时，偶然遇到了那位金发医生，当时律子恰好从通往中央教条区的电梯里出来。自那以后，真嗣对医生的猛烈攻击就从未停止过。

"I'm sorry Shinji, but there's nothing I can tell you," Shrugging, Ritsuko tried again, her face deadpan.  
“对不起，真嗣，但我没什么能告诉你的，”律子耸耸肩，再次尝试，脸上毫无表情。

"What about the Fourth Child? Is he..." He trailed off.  
“那第四适格者呢？他……”他话音渐弱。

"He's K.I.A, Shinji." Came to him a collected reply.  
"他已经阵亡了，真嗣。" 传来的是冷静的回答。

Shinji's face twitched. "I...I killed him," he mumbled. "Will I...get charged?"  
真嗣的脸抽搐了一下。"我...我杀了他，" 他喃喃道，"我会...被起诉吗？"

"No, the Commander has exempted you from any criminal responsibilities."  
"不会，指挥官已经免除了你所有的刑事责任。"

Letting out a sigh of relief, Shinji tried again. "But Asuka-"  
松了一口气，真嗣再次尝试。“但明日香——”

"I'll repeat, there's nothing I can tell you."  
“我会重复，我没什么能告诉你的。”

Shinji growled in frustration. He knew Ritsuko knew where Asuka was; he was _sure_ of it. She was the third highest-ranking person in NERV, considering the first one was-  
真嗣懊恼地低吼一声。他知道律子肯定知道明日香的下落；他对此确信无疑。考虑到第一位是——，她是 NERV 中排名第三的高层。

He facepalmed as he realized his own obliviousness. "Thank you, Dr. Akagi," Shinji said with venom in his voice and headed off to his father's office.  
他捂脸自嘲，意识到自己的迟钝。“谢谢你，赤木博士，”真嗣语气中带着怨气说道，随即前往父亲的办公室。

Misato's eyes fluttered open, at first being blinded by a bright light beaming down on her face, contrasting strongly against the night sky. As she came to, she was able to make out the silhouette of a man leaning over her. Even though the intense floodlight blurred his appearance, from the ponytail that blew in the wind, she already knew who it was.  
美里睁开眼睛，起初被照在脸上的强光刺得睁不开眼，与夜空形成鲜明对比。她逐渐适应后，能辨认出一个男人的轮廓俯视着她。尽管强烈的泛光灯模糊了他的面容，但从随风飘动的马尾，她已知道是谁。

"Kaji…" Major Katsuragi spoke up wearily and tried to get up, only to fall back down again as she felt a sharp pain shoot through her left arm. She silently cursed since she knew the bone was damaged, at least to some degree from the experience she had. Grimacing in pain, Misato rested on the stretcher Kaji had brought for her.  
“加持…”葛城美里少校疲惫地开口，试图起身，却因左臂一阵剧痛而再次倒下。她默默咒骂，凭经验知道骨头至少有些损伤。美里痛苦地皱眉，躺在加持带来的担架上休息。

"You hurt your arm pretty badly in the explosion." His soft voice was just the thing she needed to hear, especially since the last thing she could remember was hearing Unit 04's head-splitting roar when it went berserk and broke free of its restraints.  
"你在爆炸中手臂伤得很重。" 他柔和的声音正是她此刻需要的，尤其是她最后记得的是 04 号机暴走时那震耳欲聋的咆哮，它挣脱了束缚，疯狂失控。

Speaking of which... 说到这个...

"Oh God!" She shot up again, this time ignoring the pain in her arm. "The Fourth Child! Is he alright?!"  
"哦天哪！" 她再次猛地坐起，这次无视了手臂的疼痛。"第四适格者！他没事吧？！"

Kaji's expression darkened, and his eyes dulled. That alone was enough to make Misato's heart sink. "You probably shouldn't worry about that right now."  
加持的表情阴沉下来，眼神也变得黯淡。光是这一点就足以让美里心沉到谷底。“你现在可能不该担心这个。”

"The Hell I shouldn't!" She snapped, hissing through the pain that was shooting through the entirety of her left arm. "Where is the Fourth Child?!" Her lover's expression alone was enough to answer her question, but she was still holding onto one last strand of hope that maybe, just maybe the Fourth Child was okay.  
“我才不会不管！”她厉声说道，左臂剧痛如电击般贯穿全身，她咬牙切齿。“第四适格者在哪里？！”光是恋人的表情就足以回答她的问题，但她仍抱着最后一丝希望，或许，仅仅是或许，第四适格者安然无恙。

It nearly broke Kaji's heart to have to cut that strand.  
剪断那根线几乎让加持心碎。

"He's KIA. Unit 04 was disposed of as an Angel."  
“他阵亡了。04 号机被当作使徒处理掉了。”

"K...dead?" Misato's face dropped instantly after she saw Kaji nod. Even though she didn't have any sort of emotional attachment to the Fourth Child, it hurt her a little to hear a member of her species had just vanished.  
“死...死了？”看到加持点头，美里脸色瞬间垮了下来。尽管她对第四适格者没有任何情感上的牵绊，但听到一个同类就这样消失，还是让她感到一丝痛楚。

"Misato...and there's something else-"  
“美里……还有别的事——”

"I need to go back to NERV!" Misato, despite having a minor fracture in her forearm, sat up straight using Kaji as support, cutting him off his speech.  
"我必须回 NERV！" 尽管前臂有轻微骨折，美里还是借助加持的力量坐直了身子，打断了他正在说的话。

Kaji sighed. He knew if Misato was determined to do something, there's nothing he could do to stop her.  
加持叹了口气。他知道，一旦美里下定决心做什么事，他就无法阻止她。

"Father, you know where Asuka is, right?!" Said Shinji loudly across the office, fire almost shooting out from his eyes.  
"父亲，你知道明日香在哪儿，对吧？！" 真嗣在办公室里大声问道，眼中几乎要喷出怒火。

"Indeed I do." Gendo's reply came after a momentary delay, cold and collected as always. Despite just experienced a near-Third Impact, the calm man regained his semblance of composure as soon as he was informed that the Second Child was still alive. "Though there's something I need to tell you. Something you must know." Saying, he took out something that looked like a remote controller and began walking away from his desk. "Follow me, Shinji."  
“确实如此。”源渡的回答稍稍迟疑了一瞬，依旧冷酷而镇定。尽管刚刚经历了一场近乎第三次冲击的事件，这位冷静的男人一得知第二适格者仍活着的消息，便迅速恢复了往日的沉着。“不过，有件事我必须告诉你。你得知道。”说着，他拿出一个看似遥控器的东西，开始从办公桌旁走开。“跟我来，真嗣。”

Without further questions, the said boy followed the Commander of NERV out of his office and down to the hallway. It was late at night; the entire Geofront was asleep despite the ordeal it just went through hours earlier. Only a few armed guards remained in the long silent corridor.  
没有再多问，那个男孩紧随 NERV 指挥官走出了办公室，沿着走廊下行。夜已深，整个地底都市尽管刚在几小时前经历了那场劫难，此刻却已沉睡。唯有少数武装警卫留在那条长长的寂静走廊中。

"You okay, Shinji?" Gendo probed as he saw his son tensing up for each passing second as they rode the elevator deep down into the Central Dogma. Even though his tone was still stern, Shinji could swear there was something more profound in it.  
"你还好吗，真嗣？" 碇源堂问道，他注意到儿子随着电梯深入中央教条区，每一秒都越发紧张。尽管他的语气依旧严厉，但真嗣能感觉到其中蕴含着更深层的意味。

"Where are we going?" He spoke up, trying his best to contain the tension in his voice. The only thing he could imagine to happen with his father taking him down to Central Dogma was to deal with Rei's spare copies, but that was clearly out of the question for now.  
"我们要去哪里？" 他开口问道，尽力压抑声音中的紧张。他能想象到的，父亲带他来中央教条区唯一可能的原因是处理绫波的备用复制体，但显然现在不是讨论这个的时候。

"To the truth." "去面对真相。"

With a silver sound of Dink, the elevator door opened, revealing a floor Shinji was too familiar with. Associated with dark memories. "Father…what are we doing here?" His voice, not necessarily fearful, but clearly nervous.  
随着一声清脆的“叮咚”，电梯门开启，显露出一个真嗣再熟悉不过的楼层。这里关联着阴暗的记忆。“父亲……我们来这里做什么？”他的声音并非出于恐惧，但显然带着紧张。

"You know this place?" Gendo asked as he exited the elevator, eyes still focused on the road.  
“你知道这个地方？”源堂走出电梯，目光依旧紧盯着前方问道。

"Yes…and I don't think you want to know how." Shinji closed his eyes, trying to shake off the painful memories.  
“是的……而且我觉得你不会想知道原因。”真嗣闭上眼睛，试图摆脱那些痛苦的回忆。

Without further remarks, Gendo led Shinji passed through several checkpoints that required the highest level of clearance. In front of the final door, the older Ikari padded Shinji's shoulder and spoke up. "When you know more, you have to take more responsibilities, Shinji."  
没有再多说什么，源堂带着真嗣通过了需要最高级别权限的几个检查站。在最后一扇门前，老伊卡里拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，开口说道：“当你知道得更多时，你就得承担更多的责任，真嗣。”

The door opened. 门开了。

Soft and dim lighting… 柔和而昏暗的灯光……

Sophisticated equipment was everywhere, surrounding a smaller bed that was connected with numerous larger pillars covered in red-black textures. The walls of the room were stuffed with neatly arranged boxes with 'This side toward the enemy' printed on them.  
精密的设备遍布四周，环绕着一张较小的床，床与众多覆盖着红黑色纹理的大柱子相连。房间的墙壁上堆满了整齐排列的箱子，上面印着‘此面向敌’的字样。

On the bed, a red-haired girl was asleep with her hair all over the place, wearing a white hospital gown; a red and black necklace was around her slim neck. "A…suka?" Slowly, Shinji walked closer to her. "Wha…what have you done to her?!" He raised his volume, sounding genuinely angry.  
床上，一位红发女孩正酣睡着，头发凌乱，身着白色病号服；一条红黑相间的项链环绕在她纤细的脖颈上。“A…suka？”真嗣缓缓走近她。“什…你对她做了什么？！”他提高音量，听起来真的生气了。

"Shinji…listen carefully." Gendo's voice turned soft by a fraction of a degree. "She's not Asuka anymore."  
“真嗣…仔细听好。”源渡的声音稍稍柔和了一些。“她不再是明日香了。”

"What the hell do you mean by 'she's not Asuka anymore?!'" Shinji cried. "How is she?!"  
“你说的‘她不再是明日香了’是什么意思？！”真嗣喊道，“她现在怎么样了？！”

"The Angel did something to her. She appeared as pattern blue when we retrieved her from the entry plug." Gendo replied, keeping his gaze straight ahead. "She couldn't recognize anyone or anything."  
"天使对她做了些什么。我们从插入栓里找回她时，她呈现出蓝色模式。她无法识别任何人或任何事物。" 碇源堂回答，目光始终直视前方。

_"I would never forget about the treasured memories you gave me…"  
"我永远不会忘记你给予我的珍贵记忆……"_

_"We promised, we'll stay together forever and always!"  
"我们承诺过，要永远在一起，永不分离！"_

Shinji towered over the sleeping form of the redhead with an expression mixed with remorse, guilt, and pain. "You'd probably don't want to wake her up. She's an Angel now for all we know. Instead of eliminating her right on the spot, we're keeping her artificially sedated."  
真嗣俯视着红发少女的睡颜，脸上混杂着悔恨、愧疚和痛苦。“你大概不想叫醒她。据我们所知，她现在是个天使了。我们没有当场消灭她，而是让她处于人工昏迷状态。”

Gendo walked up next to Shinji; looking down at the girl, he knew he was the only one who could understand a fraction of the feelings that Shinji was experiencing right now. "You will have this." He said, taking the remote control out of his pocket and handing it to Shinji. "This is the detonator of the high-explosive shaped-charge mines planted in this room, as well as the DSS Choker around her neck. You are the only person who should make such a choice."  
碇源堂走到真嗣身边；低头看着女孩，他知道自己是唯一能理解真嗣此刻感受的人。“这个给你。”他说着，从口袋里拿出遥控器递给真嗣。“这是这个房间里高爆炸性成型装药地雷以及她脖子上 DSS 项圈的引爆器。只有你才有资格做出这样的选择。”

After all, he might be the only one who wouldn't ever pull the trigger, and no one else knew, especially Dr. Akagi. Of course the DSS Choker would be pointless if Shinji would never activate it, but since Dr. Akagi insisted on it, he couldn't let her get more suspicious than she already was, considering installing a safety on the Second Child was the _right_ thing to do. Gendo didn't trust the head of Project E, at all.  
毕竟，他可能是唯一一个永远不会扣动扳机的人，而且没有人知道，尤其是赤木博士。当然，如果真嗣永远不会激活 DSS 项圈，那么它就毫无意义，但既然赤木博士坚持，他不能让她比现在更怀疑，考虑到为二号适格者安装安全装置是正确的事情。源堂并不信任 E 计划的首席，一点儿也不。

Shinji took the detonator from his father's hand with a slightly trembling hand. "This room…this is not designed for her, is it?!"  
真嗣微微颤抖的手从父亲手中接过引爆器。“这个房间……不是为她设计的，对吧？！”

"Of course not. None of the devices are. I suppose you should know that." Gendo fixed his gaze at a particular pattern on the wall.  
“当然不是。所有的设备都不是。我想你应该知道这一点。”源堂的目光固定在墙上的某个图案上。

Having seen the Dead Sea Scrolls, Gendo Ikari knew in advance that the Last Angel would be human-shaped. Even though he didn't know about any other detail, he preferred to be prepared for everything.  
看过死海文书后，碇源堂提前知晓了最后的使徒将是人形。尽管他对其他细节一无所知，但他更倾向于做好万全准备。

Shinji didn't make a comment. He knew what Gendo know about SEELE and their plans, including the last Angel. He put the detonator into his pocket and took Asuka's limp hand.  
真嗣没有发表评论。他知道碇源堂对 SEELE 及其计划，包括最后使徒的了解。他将起爆器放入口袋，握住了明日香无力的手。

Looking at the comatose redhead with a pained expression, Shinji spoke up softly.  
看着昏迷的红发少女，真嗣面露痛苦之色，轻声说道。

"I'm an idiot who promised to protect you, but failed to do anything…"  
"我是个承诺要保护你却什么都没做到的傻瓜…"

The tension in his voice intensifying as he continued.  
他的声音中紧张感愈发强烈，继续说道。

He knew Asuka would rather die than being a…mindless doll. He could pull the trigger, and everything would end right here and then. He would go on for another cycle, and this Asuka's sufferings would stop as well.  
他知道明日香宁愿死也不愿成为一个…没有思想的玩偶。他可以扣动扳机，一切就会在此刻结束。他会进入下一个循环，而这个明日香的痛苦也将停止。

But he couldn't. As long as she's still alive…in some way…  
但他做不到。只要她还以某种方式活着……

He had promised. 他曾许下承诺。

"Shinji…" The said boy turned his head to the Commander. "Yes?"  
"真嗣…" 被提到的男孩转向指挥官。"什么事？"

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

Shinji raised an eyebrow. Never before had he heard him say it. Not even the moment before Instrumentality. "Are you saying it because you don't want me to put an end to all of this?" He remarked, his tone full of sadness. Receiving no reply from him after a while, Shinji returned his eyes to the redhead.  
"真嗣挑了挑眉。他从未听他说过这样的话，甚至在人类补完计划之前也没有。“你这么说是因为不想让我结束这一切吗？”他语气中满是悲伤地问道。过了一会儿，对方没有回应，真嗣又将目光转回了红发女孩。”

"I promised." “我承诺过。”

He pulled the limp girl into a loose embrace, listening to her steady yet weak breathing.  
他将虚弱的女孩轻轻拥入怀中，聆听着她虽平稳却微弱的呼吸声。

"Even if…even if you won't look at me ever again."  
"即使…即使你再也不看我一眼。"

His volume increased. 他的声音提高了。

"Even if there's no future for me…"  
"即使我的未来没有希望…"

"I will hold on to my promise."  
“我会坚守我的承诺。”

"I promised! I promised to her!" Shinji exclaimed. Gendo Ikari watched his son silently as he stood behind him. His gaze dropped as Shinji continued to hold the Second Child. Even then, he could find solace in the fact that the world was away from ending, at least for now.  
"我答应过她！我向她承诺过！" 真嗣喊道。碇源堂静静地站在儿子身后，目光随着真嗣继续抱着第二适格者而低垂。即便如此，他仍能从中找到一丝慰藉，至少世界暂时不会走向终结。

"G-Gendo?" A shocked voice came to them. Both turned their heads and saw Dr. Akagi standing at the entrance, the notepad she was holding moments ago dropped to the floor. "And…the Third Child? Is this…wise?" She asked the last question to the Commander.  
"碇、碇司令？" 一个震惊的声音传来。两人转头，看到赤木律子站在入口处，手中的笔记本已掉落在地。"还有……第三适格者？这样做……明智吗？" 她向司令提出了最后一个问题。

"Dr. Akagi. I believe he has the right to know about the truth," he wasn't going to say anything about the truth between him and Shinji, though. "Explain it to him."  
"赤木博士。我认为他有权利知道真相，" 他并未提及自己与真嗣之间的真相。"向他解释吧。"

Ritsuko sighed. "Fine…We don't have time to give her a thorough examination yet, but it's safe to say she's been contaminated by the Angel to some degree." She picked up her notepad from the ground. "When we got her out of the entry plug, she kept saying 'I am Asuka Langley Soryu, the Second Child and the pilot of Unit 02' in German, repeatedly. She wouldn't react to any outside stimulation, nor act on her own."  
律子叹了口气。“好吧……我们还没时间给她做彻底检查，但可以肯定她受到了天使某种程度的污染。”她从地上捡起笔记本。“当我们把她从插入栓里救出来时，她不停地用德语重复‘我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，02 机驾驶员’。她对外界刺激毫无反应，也没有自主行动。”

"MAGI could detect a signal of pattern blue in her…we don't know how it would affect her, but we can't take the risk. Now she's a dormant Angel the best we know."  
“MAGI 在她体内检测到了蓝色模式的信号……我们不清楚这会对她产生什么影响，但不能冒险。现在她在我们看来是一个潜伏的天使。”

"Can you…can you do anything to help her?" Shinji asked, his voice almost pleading, a sharp contrast to his usual confident, even cheeky tone.  
“你能……你能做些什么帮帮她吗？”真嗣问道，声音近乎恳求，与他平时自信甚至有些俏皮的语气形成鲜明对比。

The blond doctor glanced at the Commander, who nodded in response. "Shinji…we should've eliminated her already. In fact, if it wasn't for Commander's order we'd already had. Even if we can get her rid of the Angelic influence, her mind was destroyed enough that she's never going to be the Asuka we know before."  
金发医生瞥了一眼指挥官，后者点头回应。“真嗣……我们早该除掉她了。事实上，如果不是指挥官的命令，我们早就这么做了。即使我们能消除她的天使影响，她的心智也已经被摧毁到无法再成为我们之前认识的明日香了。”

"Then do it." Shinji's voice suddenly became stony and firm, eliciting a raised eyebrow from Ritsuko. "I will try my best… she's a valuable specimen, anyway. But I can't promise anything."  
“那就这么做吧。”真嗣的声音突然变得坚定而冷硬，让律子挑了挑眉。“我会尽力的……无论如何，她是个宝贵的样本。但我不能保证什么。”

Shinji nodded slowly and returned his gaze back to Asuka. The soft beeping sound of the monitors of her vital signs remained to be the only sound in the room for a while as neither of the three occupants in the room said anything for a long time.  
真嗣缓缓点头，目光再次回到明日香身上。监护仪上她生命体征的微弱哔哔声，成了房间里唯一的声响，三人长时间沉默不语。

Suddenly a soft humming started echoing in the room as Shinji started humming in a soothing tone.  
突然间，房间里响起了柔和的哼唱声，真嗣开始用一种抚慰的语调哼唱起来。

_"Shinji, let's go and see the stars."  
“真嗣，我们去看星星吧。”_

_"I'd like that." "我很愿意。"_

_Two pairs of eyes looking up at the sky. Hands clasped together.  
两双眼睛仰望天空。双手紧握。_

_"Shinji…what do you think is on the moon?"  
"真嗣……你觉得月亮上有什么？"_

_"Let me bring you to the moon, then we can see it by ourselves."  
“那我带你去月亮上，这样我们就能亲眼看到了。”_

**Fly me to the moon  
带我飞向月球**

**Let me play among the stars  
让我在星辰间嬉戏**

**Let me see what spring is like  
让我看看春天是何模样**

**On a-Jupiter and Mars 在木星与火星之上**

**In other words, hold my hand  
换言之，握住我的手**

**In other words, baby, kiss me  
换言之，宝贝，吻我**

**Fill my heart with song  
让我的心充满歌声**

**And let me sing for ever more  
让我永远歌唱**

**You are all I long for  
你是我所有的渴望**

**All I worship and adore  
我所崇拜与敬仰的一切**

**In other words, please be true  
换言之，请保持真实**

**In other words, 换言之，**

"I love you…" “我爱你…”

Beep…Beep…Beep…Beep…Beep 哔…哔…哔…哔…哔

"?!" Ritsuko rushed to the monitors, which was showing the heartbeat of the patient was increasing. "She's having a reaction to Shinji?!"  
“？！” 律子冲向显示器，屏幕上病人的心跳正在加速。“她对真嗣有反应了？！”

The said boy blinked. "Asuka?"  
那男孩眨了眨眼。“明日香？”

Her heartbeat gradually slowed down and returned to its previous rate.  
她的心跳逐渐放缓，恢复到了之前的频率。

"She could recognize your voice…" Ritsuko mumbled in disbelief.  
“她能认出你的声音……”律子难以置信地喃喃道。

"Shinji," Gendo spoke. The said boy turned his eyes to him. "Do something for her."  
"真嗣," 源渡开口了。被提到的男孩将目光转向他。"为她做点什么吧。"

"She's having a reaction to people and things she was familiar with." Dr. Akagi concluded, hastily taking notes. "Maybe bring her stuff she could recognize, it may have a positive effect on her."  
"她对熟悉的人和事物产生了反应。" 赤木律子博士匆忙地做着笔记。"或许带些她能认得的东西来，这可能会对她产生积极的影响。"

"I see," Shinji replied, hope finally started to flow back into his heart. "I'll be back soon."  
"我明白了," 真嗣回答道，希望终于开始重新涌入他的心中。"我很快就会回来。"

"Things she could recognize…" Shinji sprinted off as soon as Section 2's SUV halted on the parking lot of his apartment.  
“她能认出的东西……”第二分部的 SUV 刚在他公寓的停车场停下，真嗣便疾跑而去。

Shinji threw the door of their bedroom open, wasting no time to begin his pivotal scavenging. The first thing he had his eyes settled on was the violin he sent her as a birthday present - the object that must've carried a significant portion of Asuka's positive memories associated with him.  
真嗣猛地推开卧室的门，毫不耽搁地开始了至关重要的搜寻。他第一眼落定的是那把作为生日礼物送给她的提琴——这件物品必定承载了与她相关的许多美好记忆。

Picking the instrument up, Shinji took a deep breath to soothe the soreness in his chest. The violin had always been one of his first choices for birthday gifts to his favorite redhead - therefore, it carried happy memories for him as well. Maybe the connection could bring her back to him.  
拿起乐器，真嗣深吸一口气以缓解胸口的酸痛。小提琴一直是他送给最喜欢的红发女孩生日礼物时的首选——因此，它也承载着快乐的回忆。也许这种联系能让她回到他身边。

Then a purple-green mix-colored wristband that was starting to gather dust on the top of her wardrobe caught his attention. Even though she wasn't wearing it anymore after they got together, in retrospect, Shinji knew she was using it to get his attention. So perhaps this could help as well.  
接着，一个紫色与绿色混合的手环吸引了他的目光，它正开始在她的衣柜顶上积灰。尽管自从他们在一起后她就不再佩戴它了，但回想起来，真嗣知道她曾用它来吸引他的注意。所以也许这也能有所帮助。

Then his vision came to her spare A-10 hair slips. Shinji picked them up without hesitation as well, knowing how meaningful they were to Asuka. Piloting an EVA was her life's purpose, or at least until he came into her life.  
随后，他的视线落在了她备用的 A-10 发夹上。真嗣毫不犹豫地也拿起了它们，深知这对明日香来说意义重大。驾驶 EVA 曾是她生活的目标，或者至少在他进入她的生活之前是如此。

Finally, his eyes stopped on a roll of paper sitting peacefully on her desk. He reached out to it and picked it up, carefully and slowly opening it. It was the portrait he drew for her.  
最终，他的目光停留在了她桌上静静躺着的一卷纸上。他伸手拿起，小心翼翼地缓缓展开。那是他为她画的那幅肖像。

He immediately noticed the difference from when he finished the drawing. Two lines of crooked texts written by a marker pen stood out on the upper righthand corner.  
他立刻注意到了与完成画作时的不同。右上角用马克笔歪歪扭扭地写着两行字，格外显眼。

Shinji read the words. Over and over again.  
真嗣读着那些字，一遍又一遍。

'Asuka Langley Soryu'  '惣流·明日香·兰格雷'

'Ich Liebe Shinji' '我爱真嗣'

AN: I'm glad people pointing out that Shinji snapping didn't really make sense. Though just like huginho48 and skyf0x said, I simply needed a way for him to kill the Fourth Child. It doesn't change the result, anyway. In my original plan the Fourth Child would be out of the roster as well, just heavily injured instead of dead.  
作者注：很高兴有人指出真嗣崩溃并不合理。尽管正如 huginho48 和 skyf0x 所说，我只是需要一个让他杀死第四适格者的方法。无论如何，这并不改变结果。在我最初的计划中，第四适格者也会退出名单，只是受重伤而非死亡。

免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

**Chapter 30: Identity 第三十章：身份**

Emptiness. 空虚。

Darkness. 黑暗。

Eternity. 永恒。

Asuka had no idea of how long she had been trapped in here, a space without anything but darkness and her own consciousness. She lost track of time long ago – if time was still a valid concept here. She could feel she was slowly being pushed to the edge of losing her mind.  
明日香不知道自己被困在这里多久了，一个除了黑暗和她自己的意识外一无所有的空间。她早已失去了对时间的感知——如果时间在这里还有意义的话。她能感觉到自己正慢慢被推向精神崩溃的边缘。

_'Who am I?' “我是谁？”_

_'I am…'_ She tried to think, but thoughts weren't reaching her. _'Something…I forgot about…'_  
'我是…' 她试图思考，但思绪无法触及。'某件…我忘记的事…'

_You are Asuka Langley Soryu, the Second Child and the pilot of Unit 02.  
你是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，也是 02 号机的驾驶员。_

A voice rang in her head. She didn't remember how she got here, yet it was the first 'thing' other than her own consciousness that reached out to her ever since she woke up in the endless void. _'I am Asuka Langley Soryu? The Second Child and the pilot of Unit 02?'_ None of these phrases made sense to her.  
一个声音在她脑海中响起。她不记得自己是怎么来到这里的，但这却是自她醒来后，除了自己的意识外，第一个触及她的‘事物’。'我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷？第二适格者，02 号机的驾驶员？' 这些词句对她来说毫无意义。

Though she still felt an unspoken familiarity with them, as if she had heard them a lot of times before.  
尽管她仍感到一种无言的熟悉，仿佛之前已经听过很多次。

_And your destiny is to become one with me.  
而你的命运是与我合为一体。_

_'My…destiny?'_ Asuka pondered. _'But I want to be independent, don't I? I don't believe in destiny.'_  
'我的…命运？' 明日香沉思着。'但我想要独立，不是吗？我不相信命运。'

_Your destiny is to become one with me.  
你的命运是与我合为一体。_

_'Who are you?'_ Asuka mentally asked. She didn't even know who herself was – though her brain had told her assessing the situation first would be the best choice right now.  
'你是谁？' 明日香在心里问道。她甚至不知道自己是谁——尽管她的大脑告诉她，现在最好先评估一下情况。

_My identity is irrelevant to you. All you need to know is that I want to help you.  
我的身份对你无关紧要。你只需知道，我想帮助你。_

_'Help me?'_ She paused for a moment. _'How? Can you help me to get out…wherever this place is?'_  
'帮助我？' 她停顿了一下。'怎么帮？你能帮我离开这里……无论这是什么地方吗？'

_Yes, of course I can.  
当然可以，我当然能帮你。_

_'Then please,'_ Asuka answered. _'Please help me out.'_  
'那么请，' 明日香回答道。'请帮帮我。'

_Then just surrender._ The voices in her head came to a halt as the soft, shrill voice of a young girl rang through her ears. _That's all you have to do. Give yourself up to me, and I'll help you get out of here._  
那就投降吧。她脑海中的声音戛然而止，取而代之的是一个年轻女孩柔和而尖锐的声音在她耳边响起。你只需要这么做。把自己交给我，我会帮你离开这里。

_'Please,'_ Asuka made a mental equivalent of a nod. _'Please just do i-'_  
'请，'明日香在心中点了点头。'请就这样做——'

Suddenly a new voice came to her. It was soft, tender, and familiar. Asuka couldn't make out the source of the voice, but she could recognize the song.  
突然，一个新的声音传入她的耳中。那声音柔和、温柔，且熟悉。明日香辨不清声音的来源，但她能认出那首歌。

"Fly me to the moon…"  
“带我飞向月球…”

Asuka mentally blinked as a piece of memory flashed into her mind. She was standing on the balcony of a building she didn't know, and a person stood beside her as that person sang the song to her. Unable to come up with who that person was, Asuka could only make vague associations – affection, security, love, trust, happiness – these were linked with that person.  
明日香在心中眨了眨眼，一段记忆闪现在脑海中。她站在一个不知名的建筑的阳台上，一个人站在她身边，向她唱着这首歌。她想不起那个人是谁，只能模糊地联想到——情感、安全感、爱、信任、幸福——这些都与那个人联系在一起。

_No…_ The voice sounded panicked. _No! No! No! No!_  
不…那声音听起来惊慌失措。不！不！不！不！

A loud crash echoed throughout the void space as a crack started to form in the darkness, allowing for brilliant beams of light to seep through. _Go away!_ The voice barked. _We don't want you here!_  
一声巨响在虚空中回荡，黑暗中开始出现裂缝，让耀眼的光束得以渗透进来。走开！那声音咆哮道。我们不欢迎你！

The beam of light was seducing. Asuka couldn't help but be drawn to the light. She tried to reach out her hand to the ray of light…  
那束光极具诱惑力。明日香情不自禁地被它吸引。她试图伸出双手去触摸那道光芒…

Then surprised to see her arm appeared wherever the light shined on.  
然后惊讶地发现她的手臂出现在任何光线照射到的地方。

Even though she could only see the part of her body where the light was, she could still make out the cloth she was wearing – red, black, green-  
尽管她只能看到身体被光照亮的部分，但她仍能辨认出自己所穿的布料——红色、黑色、绿色——

"I am the Second Child, the pilot of Unit 02," Asuka muttered to herself as she saw the light shined on her chest that had a big '02' imprinted on it.  
“我是二号机驾驶员，第二适格者，”明日香喃喃自语，她看到光线照在胸前，那里印着一个大大的‘02’。

As she continued to examine herself under the beam, the song continued to sound in the distance, echoing in the void.  
当她继续在光束下审视自己时，那首歌仍在远处回响，在虚空中回荡。

"I love you…" “我爱你…”

Asuka blinked. Even under her current state, this particular phrase - it was something she had always wanted to hear – and the voice…  
明日香眨了眨眼。即便在当前的状态下，这句话——她一直渴望听到的话语——以及那个声音……

It was familiar. 那声音很熟悉。

"Who…" “谁……”

Suddenly the light disappeared, leaving a confused Asuka alone in the void once again.  
突然间，光芒消失了，留下困惑的明日香再次独自处于虚空之中。

"No change in her condition was detected since you went home," Dr. Akagi's voice remained professional as usual.  
“自你回家后，她的状况没有检测到变化，”赤城博士的声音一如既往地保持专业。

Being the most brilliant person in NERV, she had a real hard time comprehending the Commander's behaviors. For all she knew, the Second Child had always been the expandable one since the moment she was selected as an EVA pilot. Even if Gendo wanted to maintain a somewhat powerful EVA roster, now that she turned into an Angel, there was no reason for him to still keep the threat alive - let alone deep down in the Central Dogma.  
作为 NERV 中最聪明的人，她实在难以理解司令的行为。据她所知，从被选为 EVA 驾驶员的那一刻起，二号机驾驶员就一直是个可牺牲的角色。即使碇源堂想要维持一支强大的 EVA 队伍，现在她变成了使徒，他也没有理由继续保留这个威胁——更不用说深藏在中央教条区了。

Unless… 除非……

She could see how Gendo acted around Shinji - quiet and collected but not overwhelming nor suffocating, unlike how he made other people around him always felt. She had never seen him like this ever before; the disparity was concerning to her.  
她能看出碇源堂在真嗣周围的行为——安静、沉着，但不过分压迫也不令人窒息，与他对周围其他人总是造成的感觉截然不同。她以前从未见过他这样；这种差异让她感到不安。

Turning to look at the comatose redhead, Ritsuko let out a sigh mixed with anxiety and dread. Asuka – if the motionless mass of flesh lying there was still her – could wake up and kill everyone in the room using some Angelic powers before the DSS Choker could even take effect for all she knew.  
转向看着昏迷的红发女孩，律子叹出一口气，混杂着焦虑与恐惧。明日香——如果那躺在那里一动不动的肉体还是她的话——可能会在 DSS 项圈生效之前，用某种天使般的力量醒来并杀死房间里的每个人。

Even though this room was specifically designed for containing an Angel – or more precisely, a specific Angel – they never were sure whether the mechanism would actually work. And the fact that as soon as a blue pattern appears in this room, the mines would go off automatically didn't help soothe the dread and anxiety, only worsening it.  
尽管这个房间专为囚禁使徒——更确切地说，是某个特定的使徒——而设计，但他们始终不确定这机制是否真的有效。而一旦房间内出现蓝色图案，地雷就会自动引爆的事实，不仅没有缓解恐惧和焦虑，反而加剧了这种情绪。

Shinji, who had just come back from home with a box of gadgets, was sitting on the bed beside Asuka, preparing his cello and the bow. Objects, no matter how familiar she was to them, had no effect on her. And judging from her previous reactions to Shinji, probably only sounds were the only thing that could reach her under her current condition.  
刚刚从家里带着一箱小玩意回来的真嗣，正坐在明日香旁边的床上，准备他的大提琴和弓。无论她对这些物品多么熟悉，它们对她都没有影响。而从她之前对真嗣的反应来看，可能只有声音才能在她目前的状态下触动她。

Knowing the favorite instrument of his love, Shinji had spent some of his time with Asuka learning to play violin from her, a time both of them enjoyed immensely. But unfortunately, the pitch tuning of cellos is different from violins, or he would've performed this using the birthday gift he gave her.  
知道他心爱的人最喜欢的乐器，真嗣曾花时间与明日香一起向她学习小提琴，那是一段他们都非常享受的时光。但遗憾的是，大提琴的调音与小提琴不同，否则他会用他送给她的生日礼物来演奏。

"Your mother used to play a lot of cello," Gendo spoke up, his voice calm as usual, though carrying an unmistakable hint of sorrow in it. "And I like to play pianos. Music was one thing that brought us together."  
“你母亲过去常拉大提琴，”源渡开口道，他的声音一如既往地平静，尽管带着一丝难以掩饰的哀伤。“而我喜欢弹钢琴。音乐是我们之间为数不多的纽带之一。”

Shinji let out a breath. "I guess I really inherited your talents in music, then."  
真嗣轻叹一声。“那我大概是真的继承了你们在音乐上的天赋吧。”

Knowing how dangerous it was to expose too much in front of the intelligent doctor, Gendo decided to take a more ambiguous approach. "You have a lot in common with Yui and me. Not only the appearance."  
深知在聪明绝顶的医生面前暴露过多是危险的，源堂决定采取更为含糊的策略。“你和我们有很多共同点，不仅仅是外表。”

_'And the fact I could switch between Yui mode and Gendo mode?'_ Shinji chuckled internally. Truthfully he could be kind, gentle, and compassionate like her mother used to be. But time changes people. If a few years were enough to make Gendo into a person who cared about nothing other than the one in his life, what would dozens or even hundreds of cycles do to him?  
"我能自如切换优模式和源堂模式的事实呢？" 真嗣在内心轻笑。确实，他可以像母亲曾经那样温柔、善良、富有同情心。但时间改变人。如果几年时间就足以让源堂变成一个只在乎生命中那唯一的人，那么几十甚至几百个轮回又会对他产生怎样的影响呢？

He wanted to ask why his father abandoned him ten years ago, a decisive moment for his life - but the presence of a third person here denied that option. He hated him, not only for his crimes committed against Asuka, but also for making him stuck inside this endless cycle.  
他想问父亲十年前为何抛弃他，那是他生命中的一个决定性时刻——但这里有个第三者在场，让他无法开口。他恨他，不仅因为他对明日香犯下的罪行，还因为他让自己陷入这个无尽的循环中。

He didn't have a choice but to be thrown into the eddy of loops with EVAs.  
他别无选择，只能被卷入 EVA 的循环漩涡中。

Still, Shinji found himself no longer being able to vent all of his frustrations onto this Gendo anymore. After all, he had been nothing but helpful, perhaps in a genuine way, ever since this cycle started.  
尽管如此，真嗣发现自己再也无法将所有的不满发泄在这个碇源堂身上了。毕竟，自从这个循环开始以来，他一直都很帮忙，也许是以一种真诚的方式。

It was all his own fault that Asuka got hurt so badly. In fact, if it was not for his father, she would've died already, several times.  
这一切都是他自己的错，明日香受了这么重的伤。事实上，如果不是他的父亲，她可能已经死了好几次了。

"I know how it feels." Gendo started again, ignoring the raised eyebrows from Dr. Akagi. Knowing how similar they were, Gendo thought he could actually emphasize with his son, at least to some degree. He had no idea what the other Gendos did to him and the Second Child, but judging from his own personality, he was sure those wouldn't be soft ones.  
“我知道那是什么感觉。”碇源堂再次开口，无视了赤木律子博士挑起的眉毛。知道他们有多相似，碇源堂认为自己实际上能与儿子产生某种程度的共鸣。他不知道其他碇源堂对他和二号机驾驶员做了什么，但根据他自己的性格判断，他确信那些不会是温和的手段。

Shinji nodded, then sat down on the chair at her bedside. "I want you to know that I'm here for you, Asuka." Shinji slid the bow across the strings.  
真嗣点点头，然后在她的床边坐下。“我想让你知道，我在这里陪着你，明日香。”真嗣在弦上滑动弓子。

Slowly, he started stroking the strings on the cello with all of his gentleness.  
他缓缓地开始用所有的温柔抚摸大提琴的弦。

Bach's Cello Suite Number 1 in G Major.  
巴赫 G 大调第一大提琴组曲。

The music composition that carried so many memories. The music he played on the day of their first kiss. The piece of art he played only for the girl he loved and hurt the most.  
那承载着无数记忆的乐曲。他在他们初吻那天演奏的旋律。那件只为最爱的女孩演奏、却也伤她最深的艺术品。

If he only knew better…  
如果他当时能更明白些……

Maybe there was a chance for him to fix everything.  
或许他还有机会弥补一切。

"A reaction!" Dr. Akagi exclaimed in shock. Knowing how heavily sedated the girl was, it was beyond biological for her to have any reaction to outside stimulations. "Her heartbeat is quickening! Brain activity increasing!"  
"有反应了！" 赤城博士震惊地喊道。考虑到女孩被深度麻醉的程度，她对外界刺激产生反应是超乎生理常理的。"她的心跳在加速！脑活动也在增强！"

Shinji felt a tug at his heart, knowing she's still there with him and he could somehow reach out to her. He didn't slow down in his performance.  
真嗣感到心中一阵牵动，知道她仍在那里与他同在，他似乎能以某种方式触及她。他的表现并未因此放缓。

"Asuka…Remember that…your Shinji is always here for you."  
“明日香……记住……你的真嗣永远在这里支持你。”

"I am the Second Child, the pilot of Unit 02…" Asuka whispered the exact phrase repeatedly, trying to come up with memories associated with the words. Images and scenes flashed into her mind – EVA Unit 02, combat training, Angel battles-  
“我是第二适格者，02 机驾驶员……”明日香反复低语着这句话，试图唤起与这些词相关的记忆。图像和场景在她脑海中闪现——EVA 02 机、战斗训练、使徒战斗——

There was another EVA that was fighting beside her. But she couldn't remember what it was.  
还有另一台 EVA 在与她并肩作战。但她记不清那是什么了。

"But…who am I?" She mumbled to herself. "Who is Asuka Langley Soryu?"  
"但…我是谁？" 她喃喃自语。"惣流·明日香·兰格雷是谁？"

_You are my doll, and you will surrender!  
你是我的玩偶，你得屈服！_

"No, I am not your doll, I am myself!" Asuka shot back. "No matter who you are, I'm not giving in!"  
“不，我不是你的玩偶，我是我自己！”明日香反击道，“无论你是谁，我都不会屈服！”

_Pathetic. 可悲。_

Suddenly she was assaulted by a wave of unpleasant sensations. Pain exploded across her reidentified body, making her scream in agony.  
突然间，她被一波不愉快的感官冲击所侵袭。疼痛在她重新识别的身体上炸裂开来，使她痛苦地尖叫起来。

_Surrender, or Suffer! 投降，否则受苦！_

"I...will...never..." Asuka gritted her teeth as the pain quickly accumulated to the level of 'intolerable'. But she wouldn't give in.  
“我...绝不...屈服...” 明日香咬紧牙关，疼痛迅速累积到了‘无法忍受’的程度。但她不会屈服。

Suddenly, the beam of light shined again, this time from a crack larger and brighter. With the light, a familiar tone sounded, echoing in the endless void.  
突然，光线再次照射进来，这次是从一个更大更亮的裂缝中。随着光线，一个熟悉的声音响起，在无尽的虚空中回荡。

_Why you again!_ The voice turned irritated.  
怎么又是你！声音变得不耐烦起来。

Asuka wasted no time and bathed in the beam of light, revealing whole herself, the sensations instantly flushed away. From the crack, she could see the face of a boy, showing a loving smile at her…  
明日香毫不犹豫地沐浴在光束中，整个人完全显现，瞬间的感受一扫而空。从裂缝中，她能看到一个男孩的脸，向她展露着深情的微笑……

She couldn't recognize the face, but she felt he was someone important to her, someone who meant a lot. "Help me!"  
她认不出那张脸，但她感觉他是她生命中重要的人，一个意义非凡的人。“救救我！”

"I want you to know that I'm here for you, Asuka."  
"我想让你知道，我在这里陪着你，明日香。"

The girl found herself at a loss for words. "I am…Asuka." A new wave of images and memories rushed into her mind. She was wearing a yellow sundress and standing inside the terminal of an airport. The boy was standing in front of her.  
女孩发现自己一时语塞。“我是……明日香。”一股新的影像和记忆涌入她的脑海。她穿着一件黄色的太阳裙，站在机场航站楼内。男孩站在她面前。

_"I am Shinji Ikari, nice to meet you."  
“我是碇真嗣，很高兴见到你。”_

"Shinji…" “真嗣……”

Love.

Joy.

Happiness. 幸福。

Trust. 信任。

"Asuka…Remember that…your Shinji is always here for you."  
“明日香……记住……你的真嗣永远在这里支持你。”

CRACK

_Go away!_ The voice cried again. _She's mine! All mine! You can't have her!_  
走开！那声音再次喊道。她是我的！全都是我的！你不能拥有她！

Though it did little to stop Asuka from slowly drifting toward the crack in the void. Following the beam of light that shined on her, the girl reached out.  
尽管这并未能阻止明日香缓缓向虚空中的裂缝飘去。随着照在她身上的光束，女孩伸出了手。

"Shinji…is whom Asuka loved. And…I am Asuka."  
“真嗣……是明日香所爱的人。而……我就是明日香。”

Then she remembered. Everything she had been through, all of the pain, loneliness, and self-loathing she went through after her mother died, then the happiness, love, and trust she received and reciprocated after she met Shinji.  
然后她想起来了。她经历的一切，母亲去世后的所有痛苦、孤独和自我厌恶，以及遇到真嗣后所感受到的幸福、爱与信任，并予以回应。

A tear rolled down her face. "Idiot…even now, you're keeping your promise. I'm not alone…"  
一滴泪珠滑过她的脸颊。“傻瓜……即便到了现在，你还在坚守承诺。我并不孤单……”

_No! No! NO! 不！不！不！_

Completely ignoring the voice, Asuka looked up at the boy through the crack while he looked back down at her. His face was stationary, as if he were waiting for her to say something. Asuka raised her hand and reached out to the crack when she was close enough. "Just…a little bit more…"  
完全无视那声音，明日香透过缝隙抬头看向男孩，而他低头回望着她。他的表情静止不动，仿佛在等待她说些什么。明日香举起手，当她足够接近时，伸向缝隙。“就……再一点点……”

As soon as her finger went through the crack, the endless black void was instantly swept away. Then everything went white as it turned the world into engulfing brightness.  
她的手指一穿过缝隙，无尽的黑暗虚空瞬间被扫除。随后，一切变得雪白，将世界转变为吞噬一切的明亮。

Shinji let out a sorrowful sigh after his performance came to an end and still seeing no other significant changes in Asuka's condition. Putting his cello away, he looked at the comatose redhead with his eyelids dropped.  
真嗣在表演结束后发出一声哀伤的叹息，依然没有看到明日香状况的显著变化。他将大提琴收好，看着昏迷的红发女孩，眼睑低垂。

His mind drifted back to the portrait he drew for her. Only because it was their secret, something that could only be shared among the two of them, he didn't bring it here to the ward. Still, what she wrote on the paper…  
他的思绪飘回到了为她画的那幅肖像上。正因为那是他们之间的秘密，只能由两人共享，他没有把它带到病房来。然而，她在纸上写下的那些话……

_Ich Liebe Shinji… 我爱绫波……_

Shinji sniffed. Just how many times had he heard her say the same phrase to him? And how many times he felt he didn't deserve it from her? He wanted to earn it from her, but he couldn't. Accepting her love without the original Asuka forgiving him was never an option for him.  
绫波吸了吸鼻子。她对他说过多少次同样的话？而他又有多少次觉得自己不配得到她的爱？他想要赢得她的爱，却做不到。在没有原版明日香原谅他的情况下，接受她的爱对他来说从来都不是一个选项。

Still, every time she said it to him, it meant more to him. _She_ meant more to him, if that was even possible, that she had already been the only thing that mattered to him.  
尽管如此，每次她对他说这话时，对他来说意义都更深一层。她在他的心中分量更重了，如果这还有可能的话，她已经是他唯一在乎的人了。

"I need to try something else…" Shinji turned away from Asuka.  
“我需要尝试些别的……” 真嗣转身背对着明日香。

Then just to be stopped by Gendo putting one hand on his shoulders. "Father?" He raised his head, his expression quizzical.  
然后被源堂用一只手按住肩膀阻止了。“父亲？”他抬起头，表情带着疑惑。

Gendo gently turned Shinji back to face Asuka.  
源渡轻轻地将真嗣转过身来面对明日香。

"…?!" Shinji couldn't believe what he thought he had seen.  
“……？！”真嗣无法相信自己刚才所见。

A tear was rolling down her pale face.  
一滴泪水正顺着她苍白的脸颊滑落。

"Ritsuko-san!" Shinji shouted; the blonde doctor rushed to the bedside. "Impossible…" Dr. Akagi mumbled as she saw the fresh tear on her face. "She's so heavily sedated I doubt she could still feel anything! My money is on the Angel acting, it can't be her! Biologically, there's just no way!"  
"理津子小姐！" 真嗣喊道；金发医生冲到床边。"不可能……" 赤木博士喃喃自语，她看到她脸上新鲜的泪痕。"她被深度镇静，我怀疑她还能感觉到什么！我的赌注是使徒在作祟，不可能是她！从生物学上讲，这根本不可能！"

"It's gotta be her! Angels don't cry!" Shinji said back. Even from the most human-like Angel, Kaworu Nagisa, he'd never seen him shed one tear, even under the grimmest situations nonetheless.  
"肯定是她！使徒不会流泪！" 真嗣反驳道。即使是与人类最为相似的使徒，渚薰，他也从未见过他流下一滴眼泪，更不用说在最严峻的情况下。"

Shinji leaned over and took her right hand with both of his hands. "Asuka? Asuka!"  
真嗣俯身，双手握住她的右手。"明日香？明日香！"

The beeping sound of the machines grew increasingly faster.  
机器的哔哔声越来越快。

"Brain activity approaching threshold!" Dr. Akagi exclaimed, looking at the readings intently. "Get ready for everything! Give me a flashlight!"  
“脑活动接近阈值！”赤城博士惊呼，紧盯着读数。“准备好一切！给我手电筒！”

Slowly, Asuka's eyes cracked open.  
慢慢地，明日香的眼睑缓缓张开。

Asuka's thoughts had changed slightly, but she had yet to notice that there had been a minor brightening in her vision. It was no longer completely dark, but a soft and blurry gray light was now filtering in.  
明日香的想法稍稍改变了，但她尚未注意到视野中出现了一丝微弱的明亮。不再是完全的黑暗，而是透过了一层柔和而模糊的灰光。

Suddenly her vision was filled with brightness, only it was all foggy and cloudy for reasons she couldn't come to think of. She could see something, feel something touching her hand, and then rays of light flashed before her right eye, her left eye vision was still black for some reason.  
突然间，她的视野充满了光亮，只是这一切都朦胧且模糊，原因她一时想不明白。她能看到些什么，感觉到有什么触碰着她的手，随后光线在她右眼前闪烁，而左眼的视野依旧是一片漆黑。

Someone was holding her shoulders then and helping her sit up, and a blurry face was directly before her, someone she loved-  
有人扶着她的肩膀，帮助她坐起来，一张模糊的脸庞直接出现在她面前，是她所爱的人——

"Asuka? Come on, can you see me? Can you hear me? Who am I?"  
"明日香？拜托，你能看到我吗？能听到我吗？我是谁？"

The said girl blinked, trying to clear her still blurry vision. Again she fluttered her eyelids, and her vision cleared a little more.  
那位女孩眨了眨眼，试图清除她仍然模糊的视线。她再次眨动眼睑，视野稍微清晰了一些。

"Shinji," she croaked softly, as his face swam into focus. Her mind was still hazy, but it didn't prevent her from recognizing her love.  
"真嗣，"她轻声嘶哑地说道，当他的脸庞进入焦点时。她的思绪仍然朦胧，但这并不妨碍她认出她的爱人。

"She needs some water," Shinji said. Gendo picked up the water cup that was sitting on the cart and handed it to Shinji. The boy put the cup below her mouth and quickly offered her a straw to drink from.  
“她需要点水。” 真嗣说道。源堂拿起放在推车上的水杯递给真嗣。男孩将杯子放在她嘴边，迅速递给她一根吸管让她喝。

Asuka took the straw into her mouth and sucked weakly; the cool liquid slid into her mouth, down her parched and aching throat. Her tongue and throat felt dry, devoid of moisture, rendering her mouth challenging to talk, but there was something she needed to say-  
明日香含住吸管，虚弱地吸吮着；清凉的液体滑入她的口中，顺着干涸疼痛的喉咙流下。她的舌头和喉咙感到干燥，缺乏水分，使得说话变得困难，但她有些话必须说——

She took a deep breath and released the straw.  
她深吸一口气，放开了吸管。

"Better? How do you feel, Asuka?" Shinji asked, keeping their eyes in contact.  
“好些了吗？你感觉如何，明日香？”真嗣问道，保持着目光接触。

"I..." Asuka started again softly, just to be interrupted by a series of violent coughs.  
"我……" 明日香再次轻声开口，却又被一连串剧烈的咳嗽打断。

"Here, you need to drink more water." Said Shinji, quickly offering her the straw once again.  
"这里，你需要多喝点水。" 真嗣说着，迅速再次递给她吸管。

Asuka wrapped her lips around the pipe and took a deep sip, her muscles still sore. Though it wouldn't stop her.  
明日香将嘴唇环绕在吸管上，深深地吸了一口，她的肌肉依旧酸痛。但这并不会阻止她。

"I love you Shinji," Asuka mustered all of her strength to speak. "Please don't let me go ever again."  
"我爱你，真嗣，" 明日香用尽全力说道，"请永远不要再让我离开。"

Shinji's smile was brighter than anything she could ever remember seeing. It was so immensely bright and warm, that Asuka suspected she might as well be staring at the supernova as she melted under the look.  
真嗣的笑容比她记忆中任何事物都要灿烂。它是如此的明亮和温暖，以至于明日香怀疑自己仿佛正凝视着超新星，在这目光下融化。

"I'll never let you go, or leave you Asuka. I promise. I'll always be at your side. Alright?"  
“我永远不会让你离开，也不会离开你，明日香。我保证。我会一直在你身边。好吗？”

Asuka nodded, smiling a satisfactory smile.  
明日香点点头，露出了满意的微笑。

Dr. Akagi felt her heart sore as envy slowly crept up in her chest.  
赤木博士感到心中一阵酸楚，嫉妒之情慢慢在胸中蔓延。

Gendo Ikari watched the whole scene with his lips curled up by a minuscule amount. It reminded him of his brighter days with Yui.  
碇源堂目睹了整个场景，嘴角微微上扬。这让他想起了与唯在一起的那些光明日子。

Then the Angel alarm sounded. Shinji let go of her hand and stood up, still smiling at the redhead he loved.  
随后，使徒警报响起。真嗣松开了她的手，站起身来，依旧对着他深爱的红发女孩微笑。

"Asuka… I'll be right back."  
“明日香……我马上回来。”

The girl nodded weakly, half-losing her eyes. She was still too tired to say anything, though from the smile she was wearing on her face, Shinji could already get the answer he wanted.  
女孩虚弱地点了点头，眼神半失。她仍然太过疲惫，无法说出任何话，但从她脸上挂着的微笑，真嗣已经得到了他想要的答案。

"It's you again, huh," Shinji turned around and looked at the ceiling. "Though this time…it will be different."  
“又是你啊，”真嗣转过身，望向天花板。“不过这次……会有所不同。”

He turned to look at Commander Ikari. "Father?"  
他转向看向碇司令。“父亲？”

"I'm listening." Gendo straightened up.  
"我在听着。" 源度挺直了身子。

"I need the Lance of Longinus."  
"我需要朗基努斯之枪。"

AN: I was going to make the scenes longer, though it would be like adding more same carriages to a train instead of adding new ones.  
作者注：我本想让这些场景更长一些，但那就像是在火车上加挂更多相同的货车厢，而非增添新的车厢。

"Oh well, that was quick," Dr. Akagi remarked as she saw Shinji enter the containment room. Taking a glance at her watch, she continued, "it's only been three hours."  
"哦，真快啊，" 赤城博士看到真嗣进入隔离室时说道。她瞥了一眼手表，继续说，"才过了三个小时。"

Shinji smirked. "I had the Lance of Longinus, after all."  
真嗣微微一笑。"毕竟我有朗基努斯之枪。"

_"Major!" Hyuga called in a hurried voice. "The Angel has already breached 18 layers of armor! It's only a matter of time until it reaches the Geofront!"  
"少校！" 日向急促地喊道，"使徒已经突破了 18 层装甲！它很快就会到达 Geofront！"_

_"Shit." Major Katsuragi hissed, looking at the screen of Hyuga's terminal. She had just come back from the explosion site with her left arm in bandages, just to be dragged back to the frontline. What's worse, she hadn't seen Asuka yet, knowing Unit 02 was also an Angel didn't help soothe the worry in her chest. "Where's Asuka?! Is she still battle-ready?"  
"该死。" 葛城美里少校咝咝地吸了口气，盯着日向的终端屏幕。她刚从爆炸现场回来，左臂缠着绷带，却又被拖回了前线。更糟糕的是，她还没见到明日香，得知 02 号机也是使徒，这让她心中的担忧丝毫未减。"明日香在哪里？！她还能战斗吗？"_

_"Under Dr. Akagi's care!" It was a standard reply to anyone who didn't need to know about the truth.  
"在赤木博士的照顾下！" 这是对那些不需要知道真相的人的标准回答。_

_18 layers of armor had been completely destroyed so far, and only four more stood in its way before it would penetrate the Geofront. "We won't have time to get Unit 01 onto the surface in time. Send him to the Geofront. He'll have to confront the Angel in front of Headquarters!"  
18 层装甲已被完全摧毁，只剩下四层阻挡在它与第三新东京市之间。"我们没时间把 01 号机及时送上地面了。让他去第三新东京市。他必须在总部前迎战使徒！"_

_"Roger." Hyuga replied, punching in a code to set the EVA's destination. Once in, he slammed down on the red button of his terminal, shooting the Purple Evangelion along with the Lance of Longinus from the cages into a series of shafts until it finally emerged in front of the pyramid, the iconic symbol that NERV had become so closely associated with.  
“罗杰。” 日向回应道，输入代码设定 EVA 的目的地。一旦设定完成，他猛地按下终端上的红色按钮，将紫色福音连同朗基努斯之枪从笼中射入一系列通道，最终使其出现在金字塔前，这个 NERV 如此著名的标志性建筑。_

_Suddenly there was a loud rumbling sound that came from the surface, which could even be heard from the depths of Central Dogma, causing the entire Command Center to shake violently. Everyone looked around at one another, trying to find the source of the sudden tremor, only for Aoba to announce it to everyone. "The Angel has breached the Geofront!" He exclaimed, his eyes wide. "It's making its way towards Headquarters!"  
突然间，地表传来一阵巨大的轰鸣声，即便在中央教条的深处也能听到，导致整个指挥中心剧烈摇晃。众人面面相觑，试图找出震动的源头，直到青叶向大家宣布：“使徒已经突破了地底都市！”他惊呼道，双眼圆睁。“它正朝总部逼近！”_

_"Fuck!" Misato looked up at the giant holographic projection of the Geofront hovering before the entire Command Center, spotting the blue dot near the top of the hologram slowly making its way down to the red one at the bottom. "What's Rei's status? I don't want Shinji fighting that thing alone!"  
“该死！” 美里抬头望向悬浮在指挥中心上方的巨大全息投影，那是地底都市的影像，她注意到蓝色光点在全息图顶部缓缓向底部的红色光点移动。“丽的情况如何？我不希望真嗣独自对抗那东西！”_

_"She's already in Unit 00, though the EVA is still heavily damaged from the last battle!"  
"她已经进入了 00 号机，但 EVA 仍因上一场战斗而严重受损！"_

_"Shinji, what's your situation?"  
"真嗣，你的情况如何？"_

_"Locked and loaded." He answered as Unit 01 grabbed a 406 millimeter Gatling gun from the stockpiles of weapons that had been delivered to him position for this fight. "I'm about to make contact with the Angel." The boy looked up towards the breached ceiling of the Geofront, taking aim at the descending creature. Its blocky greenish frame slowly descended towards him, its bright red core shimmering as it grew closer.  
"锁定并装填完毕。" 他回答道，01 号机从为他这场战斗准备的武器库中抓起一把 406 毫米加特林枪。"我即将与使徒接触。" 少年抬头望向被破坏的地下都市天花板，瞄准了正在下降的生物。它那绿色方块状的身躯缓缓下落，随着接近，其鲜红色的核心闪烁着光芒。"_

_Shinji was able to get a good look at its head, if you could call it that. Above its core, a skeletal-like face protruded out of its body, two black holes serving as its eyes, and a black, abyssal maw for a mouth. Not wasting any more time, Shinji rose the giant multi-barreled gun and took aim at the beast before holding down the trigger. The six long metal barrels started spinning, gaining a decent speed of around six rotations per second before the bullets started flying. With an endless series of concussive bangs, Unit 01 unloaded the massive weapon into its target. Hundreds of giant AP shells hurdled their way towards the monster, each one bouncing off of its AT-Field.  
真嗣得以仔细观察它的头部，如果你能称之为头部的话。在其核心上方，一个骷髅般的面孔从它的身体中凸出，两个黑洞充当眼睛，一张漆黑无底的巨口作为嘴巴。真嗣没有浪费更多时间，他举起那把巨大的多管机枪，瞄准怪物，按下扳机。六根长长的金属枪管开始旋转，达到每秒约六转的速度后，子弹便开始呼啸而出。随着一连串震耳欲聋的巨响，初号机将这把重型武器的火力倾泻向目标。数百发巨大的穿甲弹疾驰向怪物，每一发都在其 AT 力场前弹开。_

_"No use as always." Shinji huffed and threw the gun aside. Picking up the Lance of Longinus that stood on the ground beside him, Shinji took aim at the core of the Angel, and threw it with all of his might.  
“一如既往地没用。” 真嗣哼了一声，将枪扔到一旁。他拾起身边地上的朗基努斯之枪，瞄准了使徒的核心，用尽全力投掷出去。_

_Zeruel saw the incoming object, at first unperturbed by its existence. Though as the Lance flew closer to him at sonic speed, it felt a great sense of freezing and killing intent from it, thus it uncurled its ribbon-like arms and shot them forward in a desperate attempt to intercept it.  
零号使徒看到了飞来的物体，起初并未在意其存在。然而，随着那柄长枪以音速逼近，它感受到了一股强烈的冰冷杀意，于是它展开了如同缎带般的双臂，急切地向前射出，试图拦截。_

_Then the Lance of Longinus sliced through everything on its path without even slowing down, making a huge clank noise as it collided with the Angel's AT-Field.  
随后，朗基努斯之枪毫不减速地贯穿了路径上的一切，与使徒的 AT 力场碰撞时发出巨大的铿锵声。_

_Zeruel tried to resist, then soon found itself unable to as the Lance morphed into a drill and pierced through the forcefield it held great pride in like a piece of paper, then hit its shining red core.  
零尔试图抵抗，但很快发现自己无能为力，因为长枪变形为钻头，像穿透一张纸一样刺穿了它引以为傲的力场，随后击中了它那闪耀的红核。_

_The momentum of the Lance made it continue to travel forward and pushed Zeruel along with it, finally coming to an end as the Lance made contact with the wall of the Geofront, pinning the egg-shaped body of the Angel on it.  
长枪的冲力使其继续前行，推着零尔一起，最终在接触到地底都市的墙壁时停下，将天使蛋形的身体钉在了墙上。_

_"Not so strong now, huh?" Cracking an evil grin, Shinji willed Unit 01 walk closer to the Angel, which was showing fear from its eyes. "I'll tell you now, what I'm about to do, to your stubborn, annoying existence… I'm gonna enjoy it…very very much."  
“现在不那么强了吧？”真嗣露出邪恶的笑容，命令初号机走向那眼中流露出恐惧的天使。“我现在要对你这顽固讨厌的存在做的事……我会非常非常享受的。”_

"It's a piece of cake." Then, with a nonchalant reply, Shinji walked back to Asuka's bedside, who was bandaged around her head, though from her sitting position he knew she was in a better shape than before. "Why the bandage?" Shinji asked.  
"小菜一碟。" 随后，带着一副漫不经心的回答，真嗣走回到明日香的床边，她头上缠着绷带，但从她坐着的姿势来看，他知道她比之前状态好多了。"为什么缠着绷带？" 真嗣问道。

"Well, the Angelic traces in her body mostly vanished, save for some…minuscule emission from her left eye. The bandage is here to hold the…stopgap I developed in place." Ritsuko replied, her eyes still focused on her notebook. Commander Ikari was nowhere to be seen, presumably back in his office. "It won't stay there forever, though. I have an alternative for…better appearances."  
"嗯，她体内的使徒痕迹大部分消失了，除了她左眼中的一些…微小的放射。绷带是为了固定我开发的…临时措施。" 律子回答道，她的眼睛仍然专注于她的笔记本。碇司令不见踪影，大概回到了他的办公室。"不过，它不会一直留在那里。我有一个替代方案，为了…更好的外观。"

"Did she know…" Shinji threw a glance at the redhead.  
"她知道吗…" 真嗣瞥了一眼红发的少女。

"Yeah, I know," Asuka spoke up abruptly, her voice sad, carrying an unreadable undertone. "Dr. Akagi told me about the Angelic possession in my body. Though I'm just happy that I made it out alive. You know, it could've…impregnated me, or worse."  
“嗯，我知道，”明日香突然开口，声音带着悲伤，夹杂着难以解读的深意。“赤木博士告诉我关于天使附身在我体内的事。尽管我很庆幸自己能活下来。你知道，它本可能……让我怀孕，甚至更糟。”

"Believe me, that was one of the worries," Dr. Akagi remarked, eliciting a raised eyebrow from Asuka. "Though initial examinations came out fine, there are still few things I want to make sure of. And in the meantime, she's not leaving this place."  
"相信我，那确实是我的担忧之一，" 赤城博士说道，引起了明日香挑眉的反应。"虽然初步检查结果正常，但仍有几项我需要确认的事项。与此同时，她不能离开这个地方。"

Shinji nodded in agreement. No matter how much he hated the idea of putting Asuka in an Angel-containment room that could explode and wipe out the only thing that mattered to him, Angel biology – if they had such – was something he had no knowledge in. "I…I understand." He sighed. "Does Misato…or anyone else know?"  
真嗣点头表示同意。无论他多么讨厌将明日香安置在一个可能爆炸并摧毁他唯一在乎的东西——使徒生物（如果它们有的话）——的使徒隔离室里，他对使徒生物学一无所知。"我……我明白。"他叹了口气。"美里……或者其他人知道吗？"

"No. The Commander had insisted Asuka's condition classified."  
"不，司令官坚持要将明日香的情况列为机密。"

"Wait, you can't do that," Shinji said before Asuka could protest on her own. "You can't just keep her here forever!"  
“等等，你不能那样做，”真嗣在明日香自己抗议之前说道。“你不能永远把她留在这里！”

"I know. But we need to eliminate every outside factor possible," the blonde doctor adjusted her lab coat. "I'm sorry, Shinji, but this is what we have to do, at least for now."  
"我知道。但我们需要尽可能排除所有外部因素，"金发女医生调整了一下她的实验服。"对不起，真嗣，但这是我们必须做的，至少目前如此。"

Shinji pondered for a moment. Of course he could just tell Misato Asuka's condition himself. But would it actually help? Before, the disclosure of information had always been his last attempt on fighting back against the Commander, but since now that they were more or less on the same side…  
真嗣沉思了一会儿。当然，他可以直接告诉美里明日香的情况。但这真的会有帮助吗？以前，信息的披露一直是他对付司令的最后手段，但现在他们或多或少站在同一阵线……

"Fine." He turned to Asuka with a sigh. "Asuka, do you want something to eat? I can cook you something in the kitchen just upstairs. I promise it won't take long."  
"好吧。" 他叹了口气，转向明日香。"明日香，你想吃点什么吗？我可以在楼上的厨房给你做点东西。我保证不会花太长时间。"

"Yeah." Her voice was sullen as there was clearly something else gawking at her.  
"嗯。" 她的声音显得闷闷不乐，显然有别的事情在困扰着她。"

"Alright, I'll be right back," Shinji promised before turning around and left the room, though it didn't stop him from looking back at the redhead for every ten steps he took.  
"好的，我马上回来，"真嗣承诺道，转身离开了房间，尽管他每走十步都会回头看一眼红发女孩。

"Well, I must say this is quite a conundrum we have here." Kaji looked up at the black ceiling while leaning against Commander Ikari's desk. Despite Kaji's informality, Gendo showed no signs of any visible displeasure with him. "What will you tell the Commi…" Kaji stopped himself and smiled. "I mean, what will you tell SEELE?"  
"好吧，我得说这真是个棘手的难题。" 加持抬头望着黑色的天花板，背靠在碇司令的办公桌上。尽管加持的举止不拘小节，碇却丝毫没有表现出任何不悦。"你会怎么告诉委员会……" 加持顿了顿，笑了笑，"我是说，你会怎么告诉 SEELE？"

"There's nothing to tell." Gendo's tone remained void of anything other than pure neutrality. "Unit 01 is in perfect condition and they've already received an in-depth report on it." He lowered his hands and placed them on the surface of his desk. "If anything, a face-to-face meeting would accomplish nothing other than us idling the topic away and evading the subject. It's only a waste of our time."  
"没什么可说的。" 碇的语气依旧空洞，只有纯粹的中立。"初号机状态完美，他们已经收到了详细的报告。" 他放下双手，放在桌面上。"如果有什么，面对面会议除了让我们闲聊和回避主题外，毫无意义。只是浪费我们的时间。"

"Always the man of action, Commander Ikari." Kaji smirked. He knew that Ikari could see through the insincerity of his brown-nosing, but he had to keep face. "Though you and me both know I'm not here to ask about Unit 01, concerning as it is."  
"总是行动派，碇司令。" 加持轻蔑一笑。他知道碇能看穿他奉承的虚伪，但他必须保持面子。"不过你我都知道，我来这里不是为了问初号机的事，尽管它确实令人担忧。"

"You are not making any sense, Mr. Kaji," Gendo growled.  
"你这话说得毫无逻辑，加持先生，" 碇源堂低吼道。

"Let me get straight to the point." Kaji stood up straight and proper. "I want to know what happened to Asuka."  
"让我直截了当地说吧。" 加持站得笔直端正。"我想知道明日香发生了什么事。"

Gendo narrowed his eyes. "You're walking on a fine line, Mr. Kaji. You shouldn't be interested in information irrelevant to your field of work."  
碇源堂眯起眼睛。"你在走钢丝，加持先生。你不该对与你工作领域无关的信息感兴趣。"

"My field of work? I'm still useful, am I not?" Kaji grinned smugly, though putting in some effort to maintain his composure. Before Gendo could say anything, he continued. "I wonder what is room 124 being used for?"  
"我的工作领域？我还是有用的，不是吗？" 加持得意地笑了，尽管他努力保持镇定。在碇司令开口之前，他继续说道。"我想知道 124 号房间是用来做什么的？"

Commander Ikari's expression slowly turned into a frown. "Everything that you've learned about NERV since your arrival has only been obtained because we didn't care if you reported it to the old men or the Japanese Government." Gendo placed his hands on the desk and leaned forward, lurching over Kaji. "So take my word when I say that you are getting dangerously close to obtaining the type of information that people get killed over."  
碇司令的表情慢慢变成了皱眉。"自从你来到 NERV 以来，你所了解的一切都只是因为我们不在乎你是否会向那些老头子或日本政府报告。"碇司令将双手放在桌子上，身体前倾，俯视着加持。"所以请相信我的话，你正在接近那种会让人丧命的信息。"

Kaji's eyes fell. He knew perfectly well about the risks he was taking. However, it wasn't going to stop him on the path to the truth. If death was what needed for him to find the truth and thus redeem himself, then so be it. "I'm already a dead man, anyway. I intend to burn the usefulness of my remaining time as much as I can." He returned his usual nonchalant semblance. "So? May I have my answer, please?"  
加持的目光低垂。他非常清楚自己所承担的风险。然而，这并不会阻止他追寻真相的脚步。如果死亡是他找到真相并因此赎回自己的代价，那么就这样吧。"反正我已经是个死人了。我打算尽可能多地利用我剩下的时间。"他恢复了往常的漫不经心的样子。"那么？我可以得到答案了吗？"

"Room 124 is an ordinary lad used for analyzing Angelic contamination."  
"124 号房间是用于分析天使污染的普通实验室。"

"Is that so?" Kaji smirked. "See you later, then, Commander. I'm glad that we can meet face-to-face on this." Ryoji grinned, reassuming his transparent façade. "I still have my melons to water." With that, Kaji bowed a little and turned around before heading to the exit of the office.  
"原来如此？" 加持微微一笑。"那么，待会儿见，司令。很高兴我们能面对面谈这件事。" 碇真嗣重新挂上他那透明的面具，"我还有我的瓜要浇水。" 说完，加持微微鞠了一躬，转身向办公室的出口走去。

"You just let him go like that, Ikari?" Fuyutsuki probed in a slightly confused voice.  
"你就这样放他走了，碇？" 冬月略带困惑地问道。

"There's nothing to hide, anyway. If he wants to know about the condition of the Second Child, I don't see any problem with it. We can't hide the condition of the Second Child forever. In fact, letting him figure it out by himself would act as a perfect smokescreen."  
"反正也没什么可隐瞒的。如果他想了解二号机的情况，我看不出有什么问题。我们不可能永远隐瞒二号机的状况。事实上，让他自己发现真相会是一个完美的烟幕弹。"

"Smokescreen?" Fuyutsuki raised an eyebrow.  
"烟幕弹？" 冬月挑了挑眉。

"Letting him devote his effort in finding out the truth about the Second Child will inevitably impede his progress on digging into other classified information." Gendo kept his hands clasped under his chin. "Moreover, the enemy of our enemy is our ally. I still have other uses for him. He would be useful against SEELE."  
"让他把精力投入到查明二号机的真相上，自然会阻碍他对其他机密信息的挖掘。" 碇源堂双手合十抵在下巴下。"再者，敌人的敌人就是我们的盟友。我还有其他用途让他发挥。他对付 SEELE 会有用。"

The Commander of NERV stood up from his chair and came to the window, staring at the eyes of Unit 01 below his office intently. The endgame was near, and he needed every resource possible on his side. If Shinji, the most important player of the game, already knew about the condition of the Second Child – and he was with him, he didn't see any problem letting Kaji knew, as long as he didn't tell SEELE.  
NERV 的指挥官从椅子上站起身，走到窗前，专注地凝视着办公室下方初号机的双眼。终局已近，他需要尽可能调动一切资源。如果游戏中最关键的角色——真嗣，已经知晓了二号机驾驶员的状况——而且他站在自己这边，那么让加持知道也无妨，只要他不告诉 SEELE。

The hallway of NERV Medical Ring was quiet as usual, only distant clattering sounds of boots of nurses and technicians stepping on the ground echoed through it. Shinji jogged along the hallway leading to the elevator, pushing a trolley full of food he cooked at Geofront's kitchen.  
NERV 医疗环廊一如既往地安静，只有远处护士和技术人员靴子踏地的咔嗒声回荡其中。真嗣推着装满在 Geofront 厨房烹饪的食物的手推车，沿着通往电梯的走廊小跑。

He wasn't a fan of the idea of putting a bomb on Asuka's neck while he had to hold the detonator by himself. Knowing there's no way he would kill her, if it really came to the time that he had to make the decision, Shinji would choose to suicide first.  
他并不喜欢在明日香脖子上装炸弹而自己必须手持引爆器的想法。明知自己绝不会杀她，如果真到了必须做决定的那一刻，真嗣会选择先自我了断。

Shinji sighed heavily before pressing the open button of Room 124 at the deepest level of Central Dogma. With a hissing sound the door slid open, the light was turned so bright to the extent he had to half cover his eyes upon entering the room.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，按下了中央教条区最深处 124 号房间的开门按钮。随着一阵嘶嘶声，门滑开了，房间内的灯光亮得让他不得不半遮眼睛进入。

"Asuka?" Shinji said as he saw his favorite redhead sitting on her bed. Clad in a white hospital gown, Asuka was reading manga with a deadpan. She wasn't wearing the A-10 clips anymore for obvious reasons, leaving her hair to fall down freely onto the bed.  
“明日香？” 真嗣说道，他看到他最喜欢的红发女孩坐在床上。明日香穿着一件白色医院病号服，面无表情地读着漫画。由于显而易见的原因，她不再佩戴 A-10 发夹，任由头发自由垂落在床上。

Shinji heart sored as his eyes settled on the DSS Choker on her throat. NERV had been preparing everything for SEELE's little pet, as his father was fond of calling it, and the devices now were all coming in handy.  
真嗣的目光落在她喉咙上的 DSS 项圈时，心中涌起一阵喜悦。NERV 一直在为 SEELE 的小宠物——正如他父亲喜欢称呼的那样——准备一切，而现在这些设备都派上了用场。

He had to admit, though, the eyepatch that covered her left eye that was possessed by the Angel didn't have an adverse effect on her appearance. In fact it made her look cool in an odd way.  
不过，他不得不承认，遮住被天使附身的左眼的眼罩并没有对她的外貌产生负面影响。事实上，它以一种奇特的方式让她看起来很酷。

"Shinji?" The redhead raised her head and saw the guest, then immediately turned her head around, the back of her head facing him, as soon as she recognized him, her manga thrown away.  
"真嗣？" 红发女孩抬起头，看到了来客，随即一认出他，便立刻转过头去，后脑勺对着他，漫画书也被扔到了一边。

"Asuka? What's wrong?" Shinji probed, walking closer to her bedside. She had been okay not long ago, why-  
"明日香？怎么了？" 真嗣试探着走近她的床边。她不久前还好好的，为什么——

"Don't look at me, Shinji," the answer he needed came to him in a sad whisper. "I'm ugly…I don't want you to see me like this!"  
"别看我，真嗣，" 他需要的回答以悲伤的低语传来。"我很难看……我不想让你看到我这个样子！

Knowing how vital her feminine figure was to the redhead, Shinji could very well understand her issues showing him this face. If she had a problem showing Kaji her round-in-heat-resistant-plugsuit form, an eyepatch – the obstacle to block the brilliant sapphire eyes she prided herself on – would be a nuclear strike on her pride.  
深知自己的女性身姿对红发少女的重要性，真嗣完全能理解她向他展示这副面容时的困扰。如果她对向加持展示她那身耐热插头服的圆润身形都有所顾忌，那么眼罩——这个遮挡她引以为傲的明亮蓝眼睛的障碍——无疑是对她自尊心的核打击。

Shinji sighed. "Asuka, I don't mind." Speaking, he came to her bedside and leaned forward. Putting two fingers on her chin, Shinji gently turned her head back to face him. Asuka, although reluctant, even resisting at first, gave in as she knew Shinji was determined from the force he was exerting. "In fact, this only makes you look cooler, you know, like a legendary pirate who sails her battleship on some storming ocean."  
真嗣叹了口气。“明日香，我不在意。”说着，他走到她的床边，俯身向前。用两根手指轻触她的下巴，真嗣温柔地将她的头转回面对自己。明日香虽然起初不情愿甚至有些抗拒，但感受到真嗣坚定的力度后，她还是妥协了。“事实上，这让你看起来更酷了，你知道吗，就像一位驾驭战舰在狂风暴雨中航行的传奇海盗。”

He could see Asuka's remaining eye widened a little, gleaming in surprise. "Really? I'm not ugly?"  
他能看到明日香剩下的那只眼睛微微睁大，闪烁着惊讶的光芒。“真的吗？我不丑吗？”

"Asuka, you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen," Shinji smiled lovingly.  
“明日香，你是我见过的最漂亮的女孩。”真嗣温柔地笑着说。

"But now I'm a mess," Asuka sulked. Indeed she looked like a mess – her hair was haphazard, her right eye was puffy, her skin was unhealthily pale.  
“但现在我一团糟。”明日香沮丧地说。确实，她看起来狼狈不堪——头发凌乱，右眼肿胀，肤色苍白得不健康。

And yet, from the looks of him, Shinji still beheld her like she was a goddess.  
然而，从他的神情看来，真嗣依然将她视为女神。

"Am I still the prettiest girl, even under my current state?"  
"即便在现在这种状态下，我依然是最漂亮的女孩吗？"

"Even under your current state, yes." His reply came without hesitation.  
"即使在现在这种状态下，是的。" 他的回答毫不犹豫。

"But now I'm contaminated…" Asuka sulked, her fears and insecurities surging up. "I'm not even wholly human anymore!"  
“但现在我已经被污染了……”明日香闷闷不乐，内心的恐惧与不安涌上心头。“我甚至不再是一个完整的人类了！”

"Asuka, like I promised, I'll never leave you," Shinji reassured.  
“就像我承诺的那样，Asuka，我永远不会离开你，”Shinji 安慰道。

"What if I turned into an Angel completely? Shinji, you don't need to stick with me like this…I understand if you want to leave me! I don't want to be a burden!" Asuka's volume grew increasingly loud as she continued, giving an impression she's about to cry. "You deserve someone el-"  
“如果我完全变成了使徒怎么办？Shinji，你不必这样坚持和我在一起……如果你想离开我，我理解！我不想成为负担！你应该有更好的人……”Asuka 的声音越来越大，似乎快要哭出来了。

She was cut off by Shinji's abrupt motion – he leaned closer and planted a soft kiss on her eyepatch. She could feel the heat of his lips conducting through whatever Angel-resisting material the eyepatch was made of, and the pressure exerting on her still existing left eye.  
她的话被 Shinji 突然的动作打断了——他靠近了一些，轻轻地吻在了她的眼罩上。她能感觉到他的唇的热量透过眼罩上抵抗使徒的材料传导过来，以及那股压力施加在她仍然存在的左眼上。

The redhead found herself at a loss for words. She just sat there in silence, her right eye sparkling.  
红发女孩一时语塞。她只是静静地坐在那里，右眼闪烁着光芒。

Moments later Shinji pulled away. "I love you for who you are, Asuka, not just the appearance, however breathtaking it is."  
片刻后，真嗣退开一步。“我爱的是你这个人，明日香，不仅仅是外表，尽管它美得令人窒息。”

Asuka felt a huge weight lifted off her shoulders. Ever since she had the eyepatch wore, ever since she was informed about the Angelic possession, she had been worrying about Shinji's view on her, the only person she loved in the world other than her mother. She dreaded that he would deed her ugly and leave her, then she would be alone once again, hating everything, especially herself.  
明日香感到肩上的重担一下子减轻了。自从她戴上眼罩，自从得知天使附身的事，她一直担心真嗣对她的看法，这个世界上除了母亲外她唯一爱的人。她害怕他会觉得她丑陋而离开她，那样她将再次孤独，憎恨一切，尤其是自己。

Now though, she suddenly felt stupid having those doubts. He had promised, after all, and he hadn't break it yet. And she hoped he would never do.  
然而现在，她突然觉得自己之前的疑虑很愚蠢。毕竟，他确实承诺过，而且至今未曾违背。她希望他永远不会。

"I love you too, Shinji." The redhead smiled, letting out a content sigh as she rested her head on his body. No matter how hard it was for him to maintain the posture, Shinji would do it for her.  
"我也爱你，真嗣。" 红发女孩微笑着，满足地叹了口气，将头靠在他的身上。无论保持这个姿势对他来说有多困难，真嗣都会为她这么做。

Everything was right in the world, at least at the moment.  
一切都在此刻显得如此完美，至少在当下。

Kaji sighed as he held his gaze at the gigantic metallic door in front of him. This place was labeled as underdeveloped and abandoned land on the map of the Geofront, without so much as legit transportation. According to the pamphlet, NERV would dispose of their broken equipment here.  
加持叹了口气，凝视着面前巨大的金属门。在第三新东京市的地图上，这个地方被标记为未开发且废弃的区域，甚至连正规的交通设施都没有。根据宣传册上的信息，NERV 会将损坏的设备丢弃于此。

Just as Kaji took out an ID card and attempted to unlock the innermost electronic lock, a sensation of metal contacting his head came to him. He naturally put up his hands in the air, the ID card he held was taken away swiftly.  
正当加持取出一张 ID 卡试图解锁最内侧的电子锁时，一种金属触碰头部的触感传来。他自然地举起双手，手中的 ID 卡被迅速夺走。

"Yo, staying up so late, the mighty Director of Operations?" Smelling the familiar body scent, Kaji said with his back facing Major Katsuragi.  
“哟，这么晚还不睡，伟大的作战部长？”闻到熟悉的体香，加持背对着葛城美里少校说道。

"Turn around!" Misato demanded.  
“转过身来！”美里命令道。

Kaji turned slowly, looking at Misato by the dim light of the hallway, his hands consciously moved forward, trying to pull her into an embrace.  
加持缓缓转身，借着走廊昏暗的灯光看向美里，他的双手不自觉地向前移动，试图将她拥入怀中。

"Don't move!" Misato growled in irritation. "Excuse me, but the gun could discharge accidentally."  
"别动！" 美里恼怒地咆哮道。"抱歉，但枪可能会意外走火。"

"Alright, alright." Kaji retracted his hands, though instead of putting them in the air, he took out a lighter and a cigarette from his pocket.  
“好了，好了。” 加持收回双手，不过并没有举起，而是从口袋里掏出一个打火机和一支香烟。

"Why won't you accept my call?" Misato questioned. "I haven't seen Shinji since the last battle ended. Or Asuka, since the incident with Unit 02 days ago." Her voice slightly shaking. "Shinji came to me after the last battle…after making sure I'm okay he just left…" Her volume rising as she spoke. "I…I just want to know if they're okay, damn it!" She cried, her gun-holding arm dropped to her side.  
“为什么你不接我电话？” 美里质问道。“自从上次战斗结束后，我就没见过真嗣。还有明日香，自从几天前 02 号机事件后也没见过。”她的声音微微颤抖。“上次战斗后，真嗣来找过我……确认我没事之后他就离开了……”她说话的声音越来越大。“我……我只是想知道他们是否安好，该死的！”她哭喊着，持枪的手臂垂到了身侧。

"I have my own mission, Katsuragi." Kaji sighed. "The incident of Unit 02 and Asuka…you shouldn't blame yourself for it."  
“我有自己的使命，葛城。”加持叹了口气，“二号机和明日香的事故……你不该为此自责。”

"The hell you're talking about!" Misato shouted, pointing her gun at her lover once again. "Where were you, the day of the activation test?!"  
“你到底在说什么鬼话！” 美里大喊，再次将枪指向她的恋人。“激活测试那天，你到底在哪里？！”

Kaji looked around and spoke up after he made sure the surroundings were clear of other people. "I was investigating…the Marduke institute. It took me a month to look into the 108 subordinate companies. Most of them were only empty shells, and the few ones that weren't…their research directions are mainly autopiloting and AIs."  
加持环顾四周，确认周围无人后才开口说道："我正在调查……马杜克研究所。我花了一个月时间调查了其下属的 108 家公司。其中大部分只是空壳，而少数真正运营的……他们的研究方向主要是自动驾驶和人工智能。"

"The whispered Dummy system?" Misato inquired.  
"低声的 Dummy 系统？" 美里询问道。

"Katsuragi, I can inquire into this myself, you shouldn't-"  
"葛城，我可以自己调查这件事，你不应该——"

"Keep. Going." Misato hissed.  
"继续。" 美里低声说道。

"Katsuragi, I-" "葛城，我-"

The Major of NERV released the safety of her pistol. "I want to know everything, Kaji. What else are you not telling me?! Where is Shinji, where is Asuka?! Tell me, dammit!"  
NERV 的指挥官松开了手枪的安全装置。“我想要知道一切，加持。你还有什么没告诉我的？！真嗣在哪里，明日香在哪里？！告诉我，该死的！”

Kaji sighed. Misato could be really persuasive when she set her mind, and he had learned it from his own experience. "Give me the ID card, I'll show you what you want."  
加持叹了口气。当美里下定决心时，她的说服力确实很强，这是他从自己的经历中学到的。“把 ID 卡给我，我会给你看你想知道的。”

Misato was sure Kaji won't run away, added that she was curious about what was behind this door. Perhaps it could be one answer to her numerous questions. Therefore, she returned the ID card to Kaji, who took it with a small smile and a bow.  
美里确信加持不会逃跑，还补充说她对这扇门背后隐藏的东西感到好奇。或许这能解答她众多疑问中的一个。因此，她将 ID 卡还给了加持，后者带着一丝微笑和鞠躬接过。

"Katsuragi, no matter what you know, or what you're about to see, promise me…you have to keep the secret, at least until the end."  
“葛城，无论你知道什么，或者你即将看到什么，答应我……你必须保守秘密，至少到最后一刻。”

"The end? What is at the 'end'?" Misato asked, looking at Kaji starting to crack the lock in a skillful way using the small device on his belt.  
“最后一刻？‘最后一刻’有什么？”美里问道，目光转向加持正熟练地用腰带上的一件小装置破解锁具。

"My disappearance, I suppose." Kaji said half-mockingly.  
"我的消失，我想是的。" 加持半带嘲讽地说道。

"…I promise." Misato compromised in a slightly trembling voice.  
"……我保证。" 美里用略微颤抖的声音妥协道。

The heavy metallic door slid open with the soft sound of Ding.  
沉重的金属门伴随着柔和的叮声缓缓滑开。

Misato stared at the LCL-drenched entry plug with a huge '02' printed on it, startled. "Unit 02's entry plug? Why is it here?"  
美里盯着那个浸泡在 LCL 中、印着巨大'02'字样的插入栓，吃了一惊。“02 号机的插入栓？它怎么会在这里？”

"Unit 02 was mostly intact when they retrieved it, save for some superficial knife wounds," Kaji explained. "However, signal of pattern blue remained after Unit 02 shut down, though it's too weak for MAGI to make any conclusions."  
“02 号机在被回收时基本完好，除了一些表面的刀伤，”加持解释道，“然而，02 号机关闭后，蓝色信号模式依然存在，只是太过微弱，MAGI 无法得出任何结论。”

"If the entry plug is fine…then it means Asuka's…"  
“如果驾驶舱没事……那就意味着明日香的……”

"Go check room 124. Ask Ritsuko about it, maybe she knows something. I suspect you will have your answer this way." Kaji narrowed his eyes. Indeed his speculations were proven right – Unit 02 didn't suffer enough physical damage to hurt the pilot. "Here, I want you to have this," Kaji took out a small capsule from his pocket. "You'll need this to find the truth."  
“去检查 124 号房间。问问赤木律子，也许她知道些什么。我猜这样你就能找到答案了。”加持眯起眼睛。确实，他的推测被证实是正确的——02 号机并未遭受足以伤害驾驶员的物理损伤。“来，这个给你，”加持从口袋里掏出一颗小胶囊，“你需要这个来查明真相。”

Misato took the capsule from him and nodded. "Be careful."  
美里从他手中接过胶囊，点了点头。“小心点。”

"Do you understand how to use it?" Ritsuko probed as she took notes on her notepad.  
"你会用吗？" 律子一边询问，一边在笔记本上做着记录。

"Of course I do." Asuka replied, her expression mixed with sadness and determination.  
“当然。”明日香回答道，脸上交织着悲伤与坚定。

"Remember, don't use it unless absolutely necessary." Dr. Akagi put down the notepad and sighed. "Not until the last moment."  
“记住，除非绝对必要，否则不要使用它。”赤城博士放下笔记本，叹了口气。“不到最后一刻不要用。”

"I know." With that, the redhead turned around and left the small office with a sad smile.  
“我知道。”说完，红发女子转过身，带着一丝苦笑离开了狭小的办公室。

Gendo let out a small sigh right before the holograms of the black monoliths showed up, surrounding him in a tight circle as if presenting him from escape. The Commander knew he had a lot of explanation to make, and he had been preparing for the interrogation ever since.  
源堂在黑色巨石的 hologram 出现之前轻轻叹了口气，这些巨石环绕着他形成了一个紧密的圆圈，仿佛是为了防止他逃脱。指挥官知道他有很多解释要做，自从那次审讯以来，他一直在准备。

"Was the Lance of Longinus necessary?" SEELE 01 inquired in a tone almost scolding. "Remember, the Lance is indispensable for the initiation of Instrumentality."  
“朗基努斯之枪是必要的吗？” SEELE 01 用几乎责备的语气问道。“记住，朗基努斯之枪对于启动人类补完计划是不可或缺的。”

"The Angel was the most powerful rejection-type. Without Unit 02 and Unit 04, and a heavily damaged Unit 00, we had no way to defeat it without risking too much."  
“天使是最强大的拒绝型使徒。没有 02 号机和 04 号机，以及严重受损的 00 号机，我们没有其他办法在不冒太大风险的情况下击败它。”

"The state of Unit 01 is…concerning," SEELE 08 spoke up. "We thought we all know what it's capable of, but do we actually?"  
"零一号机的状态……令人担忧，" SEELE 08 开口道，"我们以为都清楚它的能力，但实际上呢？"

"Unit 01 is known to have the shortest temper," Gendo replied calmly, silently blessing the fact that the Committee was still kept in the dark about the true potential of Unit 01 with Shinji in it.  
"零一号机以脾气暴躁著称，" 碇源堂平静地回答，暗自庆幸委员会仍未知晓真嗣驾驶下的零一号机的真正潜力。

"Hm." SEELE 07 huffed, still irritated by the immediate loss of Unit 04. "We'd never expected Unit 02 to be possessed by an Angel. I wonder is the guidance of the Dead Sea Scrolls still accurate?"  
“嗯。”SEELE 07 哼了一声，对初号机 04 的立即损失仍感恼火。“我们从未预料到二号机会被使徒附身。我想知道死海古卷的指引是否依然准确？”

"The Dead Sea Scrolls is no doubt our only book of direction." SEELE 01 chimed in. "The scenario is still adaptable. Speaking of which," he turned the conversation, "what is the condition of the Second Child and Unit 02? NERV has been…pretty ambiguous on the reports."  
"死海文书无疑是我们唯一的行动指南。" SEELE 01 插话道，"剧本仍有调整余地。话说回来，"他转换了话题，"二号适格者和零二号机的情况如何？NERV 在报告上一直含糊其辞。"

"The Second Child suffered significant damage in the battle, thus will be resting in NERV hospital for the foreseeable future. Unit 02 is mechanically intact. We will try to reactivate it after we cleanse the Angelic contaminations." Gendo replied, conveniently left out the part of Asuka's Angelic possessions. He had ordered Dr. Akagi to not mention this particular condition to anyone else. If he wanted to throw the smokescreen, he needed it to look as natural as possible.  
"二号适格者在战斗中遭受了重创，因此将在 NERV 医院休养一段时间。零二号机在机械结构上完好无损。我们将在清除使徒污染后尝试重新启动它。" 碇源堂回答道，巧妙地避开了明日香被使徒附身的那部分。他已命令赤木律子博士不得向任何人透露这一特殊状况。如果他想制造烟幕，就必须让它看起来尽可能自然。"

"Is the Second Child still usable on this stage?" SEELE 05 interjected. "If she's no use anymore, there's no reason to keep her in Japan."  
"二号适格者在这个阶段还能派上用场吗？" SEELE 05 打断道，"如果她已经没用了，就没有理由让她留在日本。"

"The Second Child is recovering. She's the most capable pilot we have. Now that we're short of pilots, we're not giving her up." Gendo again ignored the more important reason behind it.  
“二号适格者正在康复中。她是我们目前最出色的驾驶员。既然我们现在缺少驾驶员，我们不会放弃她。” 碇源堂再次忽略了背后更重要的原因。

"Your protectiveness of the Second Child is…abnormal," SEELE 01's gained a note of curiosity in it. "She's only an expandable tool for us. Is there something that we need to know about?"  
“你对二号适格者的保护欲……异常，” SEELE 01 的声音中带上了几分好奇。“她只是我们可消耗的工具。有什么是我们需要知道的吗？”

"Like I said, the Second Child's the best pilot we have right now." Gendo lowered his voice, trying to compensate for the panic that started to build up in his chest. Letting SEELE know about the true significance of the Second Child was the last thing he wanted to do right now.  
“就像我说的，二号适格者是目前我们最好的驾驶员。” 碇源堂压低了声音，试图掩饰胸中逐渐升起的恐慌。让 SEELE 知道二号适格者的真正重要性是他现在最不想做的事情。

"Hm." SEELE 01 pondered for a moment, taking a mental note of it. "Is NERV ready to face the next attack?"  
“嗯。”SEELE 01 沉思片刻，暗自记下。“NERV 准备好应对下一次攻击了吗？”

"That's what I am about to ask," Gendo replied, his voice calm. "I require the immediate transfer of Unit 03 to us, considering we only have Unit 01 as a working Unit right now."  
"这正是我要问的，" 碇源堂回答，语气平静。"鉴于目前我们只有 01 号机在运作，我需要立即调拨 03 号机给我们。"

"Granted." SEELE 01's reply was clean and neat, his tone made it clear that protest or negotiation was out of the question. "Arrange the transfer as soon as possible."  
"准许。" SEELE 01 的回复简洁明了，他的语气表明反对或谈判都是不可能的。"尽快安排转移。"

SEELE 05 wanted to say something, but considering the past experience of possible Angel possessions of EVAs, no matter how he didn't want to, he couldn't shake off the fear that a rogue EVA could happen in the US, and without another EVA to counter it, it would likely be the doom of American. "Understood. Prepare the arrival of Unit 03 in two weeks at most."  
SEELE 05 本想说什么，但考虑到过去 EVA 可能被使徒附身的经历，无论他多么不愿意，都无法摆脱对美国可能出现失控 EVA 的恐惧，而且没有另一台 EVA 来对抗，这很可能会成为美国的末日。"明白。准备在两周内让 03 号机抵达。"

"Should we start the search for the new pilot?" Gendo asked. "We already have usable candidates for the pilot of Unit 03."  
"我们是否应该开始寻找新的驾驶员？" 源堂问道。"我们已经有了可用于 03 号机驾驶员的候选人。"

"No need." SEELE 01 answered, his voice suddenly lighter. "We will send you the Fifth Child."  
"不需要。" SEELE 01 回答，他的声音突然变得轻快。"我们会将第五子送给你。"

"I see," Gendo replied. "Do we need to prepare the associating core?"  
“我明白了，”碇源堂回答，“我们需要准备关联的核心吗？”

"There's no need. He's trained to sync with unfamiliar cores."  
"没有必要。他已经训练到能与不熟悉的核同步。"

"Understood." Even though he had a good guess of who the Fifth Child would be and what his purpose was, Gendo kept Shinji's suggestions in mind. He wanted to face the Fifth Child by himself, and he saw no reason against it since Shinji was probably the only one who knew enough to do the Mission Impossible.  
“明白了。”尽管他对第五适格者是谁及其目的有所猜测，碇源堂仍将真嗣的建议记在心上。他想亲自面对第五适格者，既然真嗣可能是唯一了解足够多信息来执行“不可能任务”的人，他没有理由反对。

"Here, Asuka," Shinji put down a bowl of soup on the small table in front of Asuka. "This will do good to your health."  
"这里是，明日香，" 真嗣在明日香面前的小桌上放下了一碗汤。"这对你的健康有好处。"

"Thanks," Asuka accepted with a warm smile. Having just finished running dozens of laps around the room, she felt positively hungry, and Shinji's cooking was never delayed. Her body was fine physically, save for the possession in her left eye, and Dr. Akagi had suggested she move around in the room as much as she can to avoid her muscles getting weaker.  
"谢谢，" 明日香带着温暖的微笑接受了。刚刚在房间里跑了几十圈，她感到非常饿，而真嗣的烹饪从未迟到。除了左眼中的附身，她的身体在生理上并无大碍，赤木博士建议她在房间里尽可能多活动，以免肌肉变弱。

"Is there anything else you want, Asuka?" Shinji's inquiry reached her as she put down the bowl. "New manga? Game consoles?"  
"你还有什么想要的吗，明日香？" 她放下碗时，真嗣的询问传入她耳中。"新漫画？游戏机？"

"None of that," Asuka made a pouty face, standing up from her seat and extending her arms. "I demand physical contact!"  
“才不要那些，”明日香撅起嘴，从座位上站起来，伸开双臂。“我要身体接触！”

"Sure." A loving smile crossed Shinji's face as he walked forward and pulled her closer. He placed one of his hands behind her neck – on top of the black-red DSS Choker - and the other hand on her right cheek, before planting a soft kiss on her lips.  
“当然。” 真嗣脸上浮现出温柔的微笑，他走上前去，将她拉近。他一只手放在她颈后——黑红色的 DSS 项圈上方——另一只手轻抚她的右颊，然后温柔地吻上了她的唇。

Asuka was eager at first, to say the least – she put both of her arms around his waist in a strong embrace, preventing him from escape. Though suddenly her expression turned horrified before pulling away abruptly, leaving a confused Shinji on the spot. "Asuka? What's wrong?"  
至少可以说，起初明日香是急切的——她用双臂紧紧环抱住他的腰，不让他逃脱。但突然间，她的表情变得惊恐，猛地推开他，留下一脸困惑的真嗣站在原地。“明日香？怎么了？”

"I…I shouldn't have kissed you!" Asuka hastily explained. "I just had the soup and hadn't brushed my teeth yet!"  
"我…我不该吻你的！" 明日香急忙解释道，"我只是喝了汤，还没刷牙呢！"

"Well, you do have a point…" Shinji smiled a sheepish smile. Knowing people couldn't just ignore their basic needs, Dr. Akagi had installed a portable bathroom in the containment room, even though originally it seemed useless. "Though I don't mind, really."  
"嗯，你说的也有道理…" 真嗣尴尬地笑了笑。考虑到人们不能忽视基本需求，赤木律子博士甚至在原本看似无用的封锁室内安装了一个便携式卫生间。"不过我真的不介意，真的。"

"Hmph. Of course you will say that." Asuka huffed, her beautiful smile contrasting her scolding tone. "Still, I demand more hugs and kisses after I brush my teeth! You too, I suppose."  
"哼。你当然会这么说。" 明日香哼了一声，她那美丽的笑容与责备的语气形成鲜明对比。"不过，我要求刷牙后还要更多的拥抱和亲吻！你也是，我想。"

"Well, how could I refuse such-oh Hi, Dr. Akagi." Shinji turned his head to the door, hearing the hissing sound of it opening, revealing the lab-coat-wearing doctor.  
"哎呀，我怎么能拒绝这样的——哦，赤木博士，您好。" 真嗣转过头去，听到门打开的嘶嘶声，只见穿着白大褂的赤木博士出现在门口。"

"How's our patient doing today?" Asked the doctor.  
"今天我们的病人情况如何？"医生问道。

"You know, she's hardly a patient," Shinji replied. "Well, not in the traditional sense. She's not sick, or anything."  
"你知道，她根本算不上是个病人，" 真嗣回答道。"嗯，不是传统意义上的那种。她没生病，或者什么的。"

"Damn right," Asuka followed. "My body is working perfectly fine!"  
"没错，" 明日香接着说。"我的身体好得很！"

"Well, I can definitely see that from your spirit…" Ritsuko rubbed her forehead. It's been a few days since the last Angel attack, and there seemed to be no real change in Asuka's condition if excluding statistically insignificant readings. "Just remember, don't do anything indecent here. You should know that to keep good supervision on you, this room is heavily monitored."  
"嗯，从你的精神状态来看，我确实能理解…" 律子揉了揉额头。自从上次使徒袭击以来已经过去几天了，除了统计上不显著的读数外，明日香的情况似乎没有任何真正的变化。"记住，不要在这里做任何不雅的事情。你应该知道，为了对你进行良好的监督，这个房间是受到严密监控的。"

"Yeah, yeah." Asuka huffed, though her cheeks were turning the faintest shade of pink. "Say, when can I get out? I'm sick of this place!"  
"知道了，知道了。" 明日香嘟囔着，尽管她的脸颊泛起了淡淡的红晕。"话说，我什么时候能出去？我受够这个地方了！"

"Be patient. We don't want an Angel walking around in public, do we?" Dr. Akagi's half-mocking tone elicited a huff from the redhead. In fact, aside from the obvious safety reasons, she had kept her here as long as possible as personal revenge. Why would Gendo care about Shinji so much? She had given Gendo everything, her heart, her brain, her body-  
"耐心点。我们可不想让使徒在公共场合游荡，对吧？" 赤城博士半开玩笑的语气让红发女孩哼了一声。事实上，除了明显的安全原因外，她尽可能长时间地将她留在这里，作为个人的报复。为什么源堂会如此关心真嗣？她已经把一切都给了源堂，她的心，她的大脑，她的身体——

Ritsuko shook the thoughts off. "Now come here and sit in front of the camera. We're going to examine the radiation level."  
律子摇了摇头，抛开这些思绪。"现在过来坐在摄像头前。我们要检查一下辐射水平。"

"Rits!" Misato's worried voice echoed through the Pribnow Box. Conveniently, she met her target - who was giving orders to the technician around her - before even arriving at Ritsuko's office. "Do you know where Asuka is?!"  
"理子！" 美里担忧的声音在普里博箱内回荡。巧的是，她甚至在到达律子的办公室之前就找到了目标——律子正在向她周围的技师下达指令。"你知道明日香在哪里吗？！"

"Have you contacted Kaji recently?" Ritsuko threw a side-eye at the Major, her expression slightly shocked.  
"你最近联系过加持吗？" 律子斜睨了一眼美里，表情略显震惊。

Without answering her question, Misato settled her eyes on the greenish entry plug suspended on the roof. "What the hell is that thing?"  
美里没有回答她的问题，而是将目光锁定在屋顶上悬挂着的绿色插入栓上。"那东西到底是什么鬼？"

"It's the newest prototype of the Dummy Plug System. With this, perhaps we don't have to use kids as pilots anymore. We can avoid the incident with Asuka and the Fourth Child from happening ever again."  
"这是最新型的傀儡系统原型。有了它，也许我们就不必再让孩子们担任驾驶员了。我们可以避免再发生像明日香和第四适格者那样的事故。"

"Dummy? Do you mean AIs? Can they actually substitute human pilots in battles?"  
“Dummy？你是说 AI 吗？它们真的能在战斗中替代人类飞行员？”

"The system is calibrated based on the real data from the Children, a mimesis of the real existence." Ritsuko explained.  
“系统是根据孩子们的真实数据校准的，是对真实存在的模仿。”律子解释道。

"Isn't it inappropriate to introduce such a system right now?"  
“现在引入这样的系统不合适吧？”

"We're lacking pilots. No matter how underdeveloped these things are, we don't exactly have other choices." Sighing, Dr. Akagi turned her head to look at the Dummy Plug with a slightly frustrated expression. The development process of the Dummy Plugs that would be used in MP EVAs was way behind schedule, and SEELE wasn't happy about it.  
“我们缺乏驾驶员。不管这些东西多么不成熟，我们确实没有其他选择。”叹了口气，赤木博士转头看向模拟插入栓，脸上带着些许沮丧。用于 MP EVA 的模拟插入栓的开发进度严重滞后，这让 SEELE 很不满意。

"Speaking of which, I hear the Fourth Child is KIA?"  
“说到这个，我听说第四适格者已经阵亡了？”

"Indeed. His body is unrecognizable in shape."  
"确实。他的身体已经面目全非。"

Misato sighed again. Even though she didn't have any emotional attachment to the Fourth Child, she still felt terrible for a lost life. "Well, now that we only have one operating Unit, what if the next Angel attacks?"  
美里再次叹了口气。尽管她对第四适格者没有任何情感上的牵挂，但仍为一条逝去的生命感到难过。“好吧，现在我们只剩下一个运作的 EVA 单位，如果下一个使徒来袭怎么办？”

"That's none of your concern, the Director of Operations." Ritsuko said.  
“那不关你的事，作战部长。”律子说道。

"The hell it isn't!" Misato raised her volume. Suddenly her original purpose of coming here in the first place flashed back into her mind. "And let me tell you another thing I'm concerned with - where is Asuka?!"  
“这怎么不关我的事！”美里提高了音量。突然，她最初来这里的真正目的闪回脑海。“还有另一件我关心的事——明日香在哪儿？！”

"That's not what you should care about right now, Misato." Ritsuko waved her hand. "She's alive. That's as much as I can tell you."  
"你现在不该关心这个，美里。" 律子挥了挥手。"她还活着。我能告诉你的就这么多。"

"I want to know what's the deal with room 124," Misato was straight to the point, getting tired of beating around the bush.  
"我想知道 124 号房间到底怎么回事，" 美里直截了当，厌倦了拐弯抹角。"

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow. "Hey, follow the commands written on the pad." She spoke to a technician beside her and handed him her notepad before turning to Misato. "Follow me." She said in a low voice.  
律子挑了挑眉。“嘿，按照平板上的指令行事。”她对身旁的技术员说道，并将自己的记事本递给他，随后转向美里。“跟我来。”她低声说道。

Misato shrugged and followed along.  
美里耸了耸肩，跟了上去。

"Did you lose your mind? The information of that place is highly classified." Ritsuko scolded after the elevator door shut close. She wasn't expecting Misato to bring such a topic up in front of many people.  
“你疯了吗？那个地方的信息是高度机密。”电梯门关闭后，律子责备道。她没想到美里会在众人面前提起这个话题。

"Rits, what are you hiding from me?" Misato asked as she leaned against the wall.  
“律子，你在对我隐瞒什么？”美里靠在墙上问道。

Ritsuko didn't even turn her head. "Did Kaji tell you to ask?"  
律子甚至没有转头。“是加持让你来问的吗？”

"It's none of your business!" Misato was abnormally irritable today, being fed so much shocking information recently. She wasn't expecting the road to the truth to be a freeway on where you can drive 70 miles per hour, so a bit of determination was what she had been preparing herself for.  
“这不关你的事！”美里今天异常烦躁，最近被灌输了太多令人震惊的信息。她没料到通往真相的道路会是一条可以时速 70 英里飞驰的高速公路，所以她一直在为自己准备一点决心。

"Misato…I never thought Kaji could reach that place, much less open it," Ritsuko sighed. "Stop asking about room 124, alright? It's good for you."  
"美里…我从没想过加持能到达那个地方，更别说打开它了，" 律子叹息道。"别再问 124 号房间的事了，好吗？对你有好处。"

"I don't want to 'ask' anymore, I just want to know the truth!"  
"我不想再'问'了，我只想知道真相！"

The two women glared at each other in a silence full of gunpowder smell. Dr. Akagi finally gave in since she knew Misato's determination was unmovable. Even if she didn't tell her, things would only get more complicated if she let Misato go on an information-gathering crusade by herself. "Why don't you follow me and see it by yourself?"  
两位女士在充满火药味的沉默中互瞪着对方。赤木律子博士最终妥协了，因为她知道葛城美里的决心不可动摇。即使她不告诉她，如果让美里独自展开信息搜集的行动，事情只会变得更加复杂。“不如你跟我来，亲眼看看吧？”

Misato nodded and tagged along. The two arrived at Ritsuko's office; the blonde doctor opened her laptop before some data and a 3D image were mapped onto the electronic sandbox. "This is the hologram of room 124. Commander Ikari had given me all rights to deal with the incident."  
美里点头跟随。两人来到律子的办公室；金发博士打开笔记本电脑，一些数据和一个 3D 图像被映射到电子沙盘上。“这是 124 号房间的全息图。碇司令已经授予我处理此事的所有权限。”

"How is she?" Misato stared at the unmistakable silhouette of the redhead.  
“她怎么样了？”美里盯着那不容错认的红发身影。

"She was contaminated by the Angel. Though the traces are all gone, we still need to be safe. We've managed to contain the…possession within her left eye." She gestured at the eyepatch on the head of a sleeping redhead. "We've developed a new containment technology," she took out a copy of the eyepatch from the cabinet. "It's a stopgap made with Anti-L material, she will be safe as long as she keeps it on."  
"她被使徒污染了。虽然痕迹已经消失，但我们仍需谨慎。我们已经设法将……附身限制在她的左眼内。" 她指了指熟睡的红发女孩头上的眼罩。"我们开发了一项新的 containment 技术，"她从柜子里拿出一个眼罩的副本。"这是一个用 Anti-L 材料制成的临时措施，只要她一直戴着，就会安全。"

"What's that thing on her neck?" Misato probed, pointing at the DSS Choker.  
“她脖子上的那个是什么？”美里指着 DSS 项圈问道。

"It's…" Ritsuko pondered for a moment. "It's a monitor we use to supervise her vitals."  
“那是……”律子沉思片刻，“是我们用来监控她生命体征的监测器。”

"Oh." Misato sighed, though still suspicious of the object's actual use. "Does Shinji know?"  
"哦。" 美里叹了口气，尽管对这物件的实际用途仍存疑虑。"真嗣知道吗？"

"He does," Ritsuko admitted, eliciting a surprised eyebrow raise from Misato. "He didn't want to leave her side more than absolutely necessary."  
"他知道，" 律子承认道，这让美里惊讶地挑了挑眉。"他不想在绝对必要之外离开她身边。"

"Of course…" Misato smiled a sad smile. "When can we get her out?"  
"当然……" 美里苦笑着。"我们什么时候能把她救出来？"

"Not my call. When we retrieved her from the entry plug, there was a faint reaction of pattern blue. Specifically, it could be in a dormant state, just like how the Angel had been hiding in Unit 02 before. Therefore, this needs to be dealt with with discretion. Room 124 is the best place for her, with the containment technology and the Choker-" She trailed off as she realized she had just said more than necessary.  
“这不是我的决定。当我们从插入栓中救出她时，检测到了微弱的蓝色信号反应。具体来说，它可能处于休眠状态，就像之前天使隐藏在 02 号机内一样。因此，这需要谨慎处理。124 号房间是最适合她的地方，配备有封锁技术和项圈——”她突然停下，意识到自己说得太多了。

"Rits!" Misato, anyhow couldn't imagine Dr. Akagi would treat her in this way, her anger rising. "It's not a monitor, is it?! It's a fucking bomb!"  
“理子！”美里无论如何也无法想象赤城博士会这样对待她，怒火中烧。“那不是监控器，对吧？！那他妈的是个炸弹！”

"Misato, don't do anything stupid." Ritsuko could sense the impetuousness radiated from her. "The outside doesn't know about this yet, not even the Committee. This is the best treatment we could offer to the target!"  
“美里，别做傻事。”律子能感觉到她散发出的冲动。“外界还不知道这件事，甚至连委员会也不知情。这是我们能提供的最佳治疗方案！”

"Treatment? Target?" Misato glared at Ritsuko with wrath. "You call confinement' treatment?' 'Treating' her by putting a bomb on her neck?!"  
“治疗？目标？”美里怒视着律子。“你把监禁称为治疗？给她脖子上装炸弹就是治疗她？！”

Ritsuko had never seen Misato like this ever before. In fact, when she met her in the Pribnow box, she could already smell the danger carrying with her. "Misato, calm down!"  
律子从未见过美里这般模样。事实上，当她在普里博盒子里见到她时，就已经嗅到了危险的气息。“美里，冷静下来！”

Before she could do anything, though, Misato slammed her fist on her terminal without any signs of warning. The digitalized screen turned into snowflakes instantly, the data flow was cut off as well. "Calm down? You want me to calm down?!" Misato snarled. She then took a deep breath. "Alright…I will calm down…if you give me every authority of that room, including the DSS limiter…you will report it to the Commander as well about the transfer of control to Major Katsuragi."  
然而，在她能做任何事之前，美里毫无预警地一拳砸在她的终端上。数字化屏幕瞬间变成雪花状，数据流也被切断了。“冷静？你要我冷静？！”美里咆哮道。她随后深吸了一口气。“好吧……我会冷静……如果你把那个房间的所有权限，包括 DSS 限制器，都交给我……你还要向指挥官报告控制权转移给葛城美里少校。”

"As much as I don't want to deal with all of this mess, I don't have a choice." Dr. Akagi maintained her composure despite being exposed under the death glare of Misato. "Besides, I don't have the control of the DSS…choker."  
“尽管我不想处理这一切混乱，但我别无选择。”尽管处于美里死亡凝视之下，赤木律子博士依然保持镇定。“而且，我并没有 DSS……项圈的控制权。”

"Then who the hell does?!"  
“那他妈的谁有？！”

Ritsuko caught the words just before they came out of her mouth. Of course it wasn't Misato's business whether or not she knew about who had the trigger. However, recalling how Gendo had been acting around Shinji and Asuka, she couldn't help but feel soreness in her chest. She would like to see how it would end up between the fortress of determination and the torrent of will.  
律子在话即将出口前抓住了它们。当然，是否知道谁拥有触发器并不是美里的事。然而，回想起源堂在真嗣和明日香周围的行为，她不禁感到胸口一阵酸楚。她很想看看决心堡垒与意志洪流之间最终会如何收场。

"Shinji does." She said slowly.  
"真嗣知道。" 她缓缓说道。

Misato's following sharp words choked at her throat. "You…you can't be serious."  
"美里接下来的尖锐话语哽在了喉咙里。“你……你不是认真的吧。””

"Since you already know, why don't you ask him yourself?"  
“既然你已经知道了，为什么不自己去问他呢？”

Misato felt her knees wobble before she fell back onto a nearby chair. "What did he do to deserve this…" The anger in her voice was completely gone, replaced by deep sadness. "It's not the kind of responsibility you put on a fourteen years old kid! They're together, dammit! Are you seriously gonna make him…do…" She couldn't bring the words out of her mouth.  
“美里感到膝盖一软，跌坐在旁边的椅子上。“他做了什么要承受这些……”她声音中的愤怒已完全消失，取而代之的是深深的悲伤。“这不是一个十四岁孩子该承担的责任！他们在一起的，该死！你真的要让他……去做……”她无法将那些话说出口。”

"I'm sorry, but it's the Commander's decision. No compromises."  
"很抱歉，但这是指挥官的决定。不容妥协。"

Suddenly Misato shot up from her chair and strode toward the door. "Where are you going?" Ritsuko asked.  
突然，美里从椅子上站起来，大步走向门口。“你要去哪儿？”律子问道。

"I'll see what I can do. It's better than sitting here and doing nothing." Came to her a determined, yet sorrowful reply.  
"我会尽力而为。总比坐在这里无所事事要好。"她坚定而悲伤地回答道。

"Sometimes, adults throw tantrums like kids." Shaking her head, Ritsuko sighed after the office door slid close behind the Major of NERV. In fact, she doubted the Commander's decision herself. Why would he tell Shinji, of all people, about Asuka's condition? And why give him the detonator of the DSS Choker?  
"有时候，成年人也会像孩子一样发脾气。" 律子摇着头，在 NERV 的少校离开办公室后叹了口气。事实上，她自己也怀疑司令的决定。为什么他会告诉真嗣，尤其是关于明日香的情况？又为什么要给他 DSS 项圈的引爆器？

Nothing made sense to her, but she didn't want to start her own investigation. Her job was to make sure the Angel wouldn't awake, and she needed to devote every last bit of her attention to the subject.  
一切对她来说都毫无头绪，但她并不想展开自己的调查。她的职责是确保天使不会苏醒，她需要将全部注意力倾注于此。

The darkness around Fuyutsuki was only brightened by the glowing red letters that shone through the shadows on the monolithic holograms representing SEELE's Committee. Sighing, the Sub-Commander of NERV shook his head, feeling the coldness of the handcuff around his wrist.  
四周的黑暗仅被透过阴影的红色发光字母微微照亮，这些字母闪烁在代表 SEELE 委员会的巨大全息图上。叹了口气，NERV 副司令俯首摇头，感受到手腕上手铐的冰冷。

He had little recollections of how he ended up here, though it didn't surprise him. Knowing how SEELE had always been skeptical of everything, Gendo Ikari's odd behaviors - the actions that even confused Fuyutsuki himself - would definitely raise suspicion. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before SEELE lay their hands on the only person other than Gendo who might know the plan behind the curtain.  
他对如何落得如此境地记忆模糊，但这并不令他意外。深知 SEELE 对一切持怀疑态度，碇源堂那些连自己也感到困惑的异常行为，无疑会引发疑虑。因此，SEELE 对唯一可能知晓幕后计划的除碇之外的人下手，只是时间问题。

"Greetings, Fuyutsuki." The center monolith, SEELE 01 spoke, its distorted voice echoing throughout the vast blackened room.  
"你好，冬月。"中央的巨石，SEELE 01 开口道，其扭曲的声音在广阔的漆黑房间中回荡。

"Spare the pleasantries, Keel." The Vice Commander grumbled, trying to readjust himself in his chair to get a little more comfortable. The identity of SEELE 01, the chairman of the Committee, was no secret to him. "Let's just get this over with."  
“省去客套话吧，基尔。”副指挥官咕哝着，试图在椅子上重新调整姿势以更舒适些。他对 SEELE 01，即委员会主席的身份并不陌生。“让我们尽快结束这一切。”

SEELE 01 let out a short laugh. "We didn't bring you here to kill you. In fact, it would be much easier that way."  
SEELE 01 发出了一声短促的笑声。“我们带你来这里不是为了杀你。事实上，那样做会简单得多。”

Fuyutsuki frowned. He had always thought himself expandable in the scenario. "Then what do you want?"  
冬月皱了皱眉。他一直认为自己在这个计划中是可有可无的。“那你们想要什么？”

"Simple. Gendo Ikari's behaviors...are concerning to us." SEELE 04 growled. "And we deem you hold information that can be of value to us."  
“简单。碇源堂的行为……令我们担忧。”SEELE 04 咆哮道，“我们认为你掌握着对我们有价值的信息。”

Kozo snickered under his breath. "I know valuable information? I can't imagine what I could possibly know that…"  
Kozo 低声窃笑。“我知道有价值的信息？我想不出我可能知道什么……”

"You have been with Ikari since the beginning." SEELE 02 snapped. "We want for you to tell us everything that you know. Especially things concerning the Second and the Third Child."  
“你从一开始就跟随碇源堂。”SEELE 02 厉声说道。“我们要你告诉我们你所知道的一切。特别是关于第二适格者和第三适格者的事情。”

The Sub-Commander sighed as he shook his head. He knew that any information he shared with them would just be redundant. Fuyutsuki felt he had no choice but to humor them. "Alright." He agreed. "I'll start from the beginning."  
副司令叹了口气，摇了摇头。他知道，自己分享的任何信息对他们来说都只是多余的。冬月感觉自己别无选择，只能迁就他们。“好吧。”他同意道，“我就从头说起。”

## *Chapter 33*: Chapter 33: Invisible Hand  
*第 33 章*：第 33 章：无形之手

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

This is supposed to be the second half of the last chapter, but somehow it breaks the flow of the story. So I decided to split it in two.  
这本应是最后一章的后半部分，但不知何故打断了故事的连贯性。所以我决定将其一分为二。

**Chapter 33: Invisible Hand  
第三十三章：无形之手**

Shinji trotted across NERV's silent hallways, pushing a small tray full of food. It had become a routine for him to cook meals in the Geofront kitchen and bring them to room 124 so that Asuka could have food other than the cafeteria junk.  
真嗣快步穿过 NERV 寂静的走廊，推着装满食物的小托盘。他已经在地底厨房做饭并送到 124 号房间，让明日香能吃到除了食堂垃圾食品以外的食物，这已成为他的日常。

For some reasons unknown to him, Dr. Akagi had been trying to deny Asuka of eating food other than liquid food and glucose solutions, though it didn't last long - after he once secretly brought some sushi he made for her to eat and nothing really happened, no matter what Ritsuko didn't have legit reasons to deny her proper food anymore.  
出于某些他不知晓的原因，赤城博士一直试图阻止明日香食用除流质食物和葡萄糖溶液以外的食物，不过这并未持续太久——自从他偷偷带去自己为她做的寿司，而她吃完后并无任何异常反应，无论怎样，律子再也无法以正当理由拒绝给她正常食物了。

"Shinji." A familiar, yet unfamiliarly cold female voice came to him, echoing through the silent hallway. The said boy turned his head to the source of the voice with a raised eyebrow. "Yes, Misato-san?" He tried his best to maintain the calmness of his voice. He wasn't expecting to meet the Major here, though he wasn't really planning to evade her, either. Asuka simply got too much of his attention.  
“真嗣。”一个熟悉却又异常冷漠的女性声音传来，回荡在寂静的走廊中。被叫到的男孩挑起眉毛，转头望向声音的来源。“是的，美里小姐？”他尽力保持声音的平静。虽然没料到会在这里遇到美里少校，但他也并非有意回避她。明日香实在是吸引了他的太多注意力。

"Where were you these days?" A hint of concern slipped into her voice. After days of observation, Misato knew this particular time of the day Shinji would always come to the Geofront kitchen to cook food. Cooking for Asuka would be the only logical explanation she could come up with.  
"这些天你去哪儿了？"一丝关切悄然滑入她的声音。经过多日的观察，美里知道每天这个时候真嗣总会来到地底都市的厨房做饭。为明日香做饭是她能想到的唯一合理解释。

Shinji sighed. "I was taking care of Asuka. And I still am."  
真嗣叹了口气。"我在照顾明日香。现在依然如此。"

"Why didn't you tell me anything, Shinji?!" Misato raised her volume.  
"你为什么不告诉我，真嗣？！"美里提高了音量。

The accused boy raised an eyebrow. "I didn't really have time. Just…too much has been going on." In fact, he didn't want to lie to – or more like _deceive_ – Misato, whom he considered as his surrogate mother.  
被指控的男孩挑了挑眉。“我真的没时间。只是……最近发生的事情太多了。”实际上，他不想对——或者说欺骗——美里撒谎，他把美里视为自己的代理母亲。

Still, knowing how sentimental she could get, letting her know that Asuka was _injured_ was fine, but the rest? Shinji didn't feel like inflicting more damage to the emotional dam of the Major, not to mention it wasn't like she could help-  
尽管如此，知道她有多么感性，让她知道明日香受伤是可以的，但其他的呢？真嗣不想对美里少校的情感堤坝造成更多伤害，更不用说她也无法提供帮助——

"Why didn't you tell me that she's possessed by an Angel?!"  
“你为什么不告诉我她被天使附身了？！”

Damn. Shinji silently cursed before speaking up in confusion. "Misato-san, how did you-"  
该死。真嗣默默地咒骂了一声，然后困惑地开口：“美里小姐，你怎么会——”

"Shinji!" The anxious Major exclaimed, cutting him off. "What else you are not telling me?!"  
“真嗣！”焦急的少校打断了他，“你还有什么没告诉我？！”

"Misato-san…" Shinji tried.  
“美里小姐……” 真嗣尝试着开口。

"Shinji, I don't know what's going on, but please be honest with me, alright?" Misato said in an almost pleading tone. "Do you actually have the trigger of the bomb on her neck?"  
“真嗣，我不知道发生了什么，但请对我诚实，好吗？”美里几乎是用恳求的语气说道，“你真的有她脖子上的炸弹引爆器吗？”

Shinji went wide-eyed. No one else except his father, Dr. Akagi, and himself knew about it, and he was planning to tell Asuka about it as soon as possible. Maybe he underestimated Kaji's spying potentials, after all. "I do." He sighed.  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛。除了他父亲、赤木博士和他自己，没有人知道这件事，而他正打算尽快告诉明日香。也许他终究低估了加持的间谍潜力。“我知道。”他叹了口气。

"Give it to me, Shinji." Misato switched to an unquestionable tone.  
“把它给我，真嗣。”美里换上了一种不容置疑的语气。

"Excuse me, Misato-san. But I can't do that." Shinji straightened up as well, his tone shifting into a direction Misato had heard a lot, just not from him.  
“抱歉，美里小姐。但我不能这么做。”真嗣也挺直了身子，语气转向了一个美里听过很多次，却从未从他口中听到的方向。

"But it's too dangerous! Do you understand how much responsibility you're putting on your shoulders?" Misato questioned. "It's a person's life, damn it! And… she's also…your… There's no way you will make the right decision!"  
“但这也太危险了！你明白自己肩负着多大的责任吗？”美里质问道，“这可是一条人命，该死的！而且……她也是……你的……你绝不可能做出正确的决定！”

"Misato-san, I know who Asuka is to me. And that's why I am the best choice to hold the trigger," Shinji forced out. Misato didn't need to know about the whole truth – that he would end the world if it really comes to that - behind him and Asuka, it would only make things more complicated than it already was.  
"美里小姐，我知道明日香对我意味着什么。正因为如此，我才最适合握住这个扳机，" 真嗣勉强说道。美里不需要知道全部真相——如果真的到了那一步，他会结束这个世界——他和明日香之间的事，只会让事情变得更加复杂。

"But you're still a kid! This kind of responsibility comes to adults!" Misato took a few steps forward as she spoke. "Give it to me, Shinji. You'll just never make the right choice."  
"但你还是个孩子！这种责任应该由成年人来承担！" 美里一边说着，一边向前走了几步。"给我吧，真嗣。你只会做出错误的选择。"

No matter how much Shinji hated to do it, now he had no choice but to scold her. "Misato-san…the right choice? Is killing her the _right choice_, as you said?" He walked up in front of Misato, keeping their eyes in contact. "What if the right choice is to not kill her?"  
无论新治有多么不愿这么做，现在他别无选择，只能责备她。“美里小姐……正确的选择？就像你说的，杀死她是正确的选择吗？”他走到美里面前，保持目光接触。“如果正确的选择是不杀她呢？”

"But…" Misato paused for a moment as Shinji's words echoed through her mind. Was her fear of Shinji not making the right choice the only reason? Or was it even the _main_ reason? "But if she really turned into an Angel, we can't just…"  
"但是…" 美里顿了一下，真嗣的话在她脑海中回响。她害怕真嗣做出错误选择的恐惧是唯一的原因吗？还是说，这甚至不是主要原因？"但如果她真的变成了使徒，我们不能就这样…"

Shinji let out a short laugh, his expression giving an impression of 'I knew it from the beginning.' "Misato-san…you want the trigger just that you can make sure you'll have your revenge against the Angels, correct? Asuka or no Asuka, the only thing you care about is the Angel inside-"  
真嗣发出了一声短促的笑声，他的表情给人一种‘我早就知道’的印象。“美里小姐……你想要那个扳机，只是为了确保你能向使徒复仇，对吧？无论有没有明日香，你唯一关心的就是使徒内部……”

The last sentence pulled a string in Misato's heart, causing her to instinctively pull her hand back and swing it across Shinji's face, and hard. The lavender-haired woman could feel a stinging sensation in her palm as the boy bent over and held his own hand against his red cheek. "Shinji…how dare you?!"  
最后一句话触动了 Misato 的心弦，让她本能地抽回手，狠狠地甩在 Shinji 的脸上。紫发的女子能感觉到手掌传来一阵刺痛，男孩弯下腰，用手捂住发红的脸颊。“Shinji…你怎么敢？！”

She had expected many reactions from him, from crying like a boy at his age would to surrendering to her authority. Therefore when she was met with the freezing glare from him, Misato felt a chill ran down her spine.  
她本以为他会做出许多反应，从像他这个年纪的男孩那样哭泣，到屈服于她的权威。因此，当她面对他冰冷的目光时，Misato 感到一股寒意沿着脊背而下。

At that time, Misato was once again reminded how much of Gendo's son Shinji was.  
那时，Misato 再次意识到 Shinji 是多么像他的父亲 Gendo。

She wanted to say something, but found herself unable to, her mind in turmoil caused by Shinji words. Was she using the kids as a tool to avenge the Angels? How much did she actually care about them? What would be her choice between the children and killing an Angel?  
她想说些什么，却发现无法开口，真嗣的话让她的思绪陷入了混乱。她是在利用孩子们作为向使徒复仇的工具吗？她到底有多关心他们？在孩子们和杀死一个使徒之间，她会选择什么？

Shinji's glare softened as soon as it came. After all, he knew Misato still cared about him and Asuka - just like himself, he cared about Misato as well, it's just that Asuka always took his highest priority. Shinji sighed as he rubbed his red cheek. "I'm sorry, Misato-san. I shouldn't have said it. But the food is getting cold, and I really need to go now." Shinji said before promptly walking away and pushing the tray along with him, leaving the Major alone in the hallway with her blizzard of thoughts.  
真嗣的目光一出现就软化了。毕竟，他知道美里仍然关心他和明日香——就像他自己一样，他也关心美里，只是明日香始终是他最优先考虑的。真嗣叹了口气，揉了揉他发红的脸颊。“对不起，美里小姐。我不该说那些话。但食物要凉了，我真的得走了。”真嗣说完便快步离开，推着托盘，留下美里独自一人在走廊里，思绪如暴风雪般翻涌。

Shinji smiled as he enjoyed the sight of Asuka enjoying the food he made for her, not that she didn't enjoy them before. Seeing her slowly getting back to normal just brought blew all the dark clouds away from his sky. Though a frown crossed his face as he remembered he had to yet tell her a crucial piece of information.  
真嗣微笑着，欣赏着明日香享受他为她做的食物的情景，并非她以前不喜欢这些。看着她逐渐恢复正常，仿佛驱散了他天空中的所有乌云。然而，当他想起还有一件关键信息尚未告诉她时，眉头不禁皱了起来。

Shinji sighed in resignation. "Asuka…I want to tell you something."  
真嗣叹了口气，无奈地说：“明日香……我有件事想告诉你。”

"Shoot." The redhead replied after swallowing the food.  
“说吧。”红发少女咽下食物后回答道。

"I…I have the trigger…of the bomb on your neck." Shinji spoke up with visible effort, not really knowing what kind of response he should expect from her. After all, putting a DSS Choker around her neck had never happened ever before.  
“我……我控制着你脖子上的炸弹引爆器。” 真嗣费力地说道，不太确定她会有什么样的反应。毕竟，在她脖子上戴上 DSS 项圈这种事从未发生过。

"Wha-oh," Asuka let out a short laugh, touching the DSS Choker on her throat with her free hand. "I mean, it's not a big deal, is it? It's not like it will go off accidentally."  
“哇哦，” 明日香短促地笑了一声，用空着的那只手摸了摸喉咙上的 DSS 项圈。“我是说，这没什么大不了的，对吧？又不会不小心引爆。”

"You're not…afraid of me holding it?" Shinji carefully spoke up. "I mean, it's your life. I literally hold your life in my hand, Asuka. What if-"  
“你……不害怕我拿着它吗？”真嗣小心翼翼地开口，“我是说，这是你的生命。我实际上掌握着你的生命，明日香。万一……”

He was silenced as Asuka turned around and put the finger on his lips. Looking directly into his eyes, the redhead started, "Shinji, I don't mind. Hell, I was actually worried about who holds it. I trust you to make the right decisions. I don't trust Dr. Akagi, the commander, or anyone else in that sense." Her tone turned more serious as she continued. _'Besides, it's not like you would just end me and get your hands on other pretty faces, right?' w_as left unsaid. Jokes were one thing, but that question was too serious about being brought up.  
他话未说完，就被明日香转身用手指按在唇上打断了。红发少女直视着他的眼睛，开始说道：“真嗣，我不介意。其实，我反而担心谁来保管它。我相信你会做出正确的决定。我不信任赤木博士、司令，或者任何其他人。”她的语气变得更加严肃，继续说道：“再说了，你也不会就这样结束我，然后去追求其他漂亮面孔，对吧？”这句话虽未明说，但玩笑归玩笑，这个问题太过严肃，不宜提及。

She could feel Shinji's body slowly relaxed. "I-Thank you, Asuka."  
她能感觉到真嗣的身体慢慢放松。“我——谢谢你，明日香。”

"You're an idiot, alright." Asuka sighed, shaking her head, though the smile on her face remained. "Oh well, it's what had to be done. The choker, I mean. As long as the Angel is in my body, I'm a walking threat to humanity. The reason why they hadn't end me yet is probably that they still want me to pilot the EVAs." She shrugged.  
“你真是个傻瓜，没错。”明日香叹了口气，摇着头，尽管脸上的笑容依旧。“唉，这也是不得不做的。我是说那个项圈。只要天使还在我体内，我就是对人类的一大威胁。他们之所以还没结束我的生命，大概是因为他们还想让我驾驶 EVA 吧。”她耸了耸肩。

Shinji didn't need to tell her the truth, though the reality she had stated wasn't off the charts, either. In fact, if it wasn't for his father's orders, NERV would've already eliminated Asuka. "It just disturbs seeing you wearing a bomb every day. You were right. I can't trust other people to have it."  
虽然明日香所说的现实并不离谱，但真嗣无需告诉她真相。事实上，如果不是他父亲的命令，NERV 可能早已除掉了明日香。“看到你每天戴着炸弹，真是让人不安。你说得对。我不能相信别人来保管它。”

"Oh well, can't be helped, I guess." Asuka shrugged, deep in her own thoughts. Did she have a future? Not much likely. She wasn't afraid of her own death if it comes to that. What she dreaded was she didn't want to hurt Shinji. She just loved him so much he almost made her forget about her mother.  
“唉，没办法，我想也只能这样了。” 明日香耸了耸肩，陷入了沉思。她还有未来吗？可能性不大。如果真到了那一步，她并不害怕自己的死亡。她所害怕的是不想伤害真嗣。她对他的爱如此之深，几乎让她忘记了母亲。

She shook the thoughts off and returned to the meal. If the future was unpredictable, she would enjoy her life as much as possible. And she had to devise a plan for it.  
她甩开这些念头，回到餐桌上。如果未来不可预测，她会尽可能享受生活。而且，她必须为此制定一个计划。

A beam of white light shone into the darkened room, looming over grey-haired Sub-Commander of NERV and casting his shadow across the floor. His stomach growled from the lack of food, and his wrists had long since been rubbed raw by the handcuffs that bound them. Slowly, his eyes cracked open, snapping out of his drowsy state as echoic footsteps traveled across the room. "Sorry that I'm late. I had to put out the guards outside to sleep for a while." Kaji's voice came as both a surprise and a blessing to Fuyutsuki.  
一束白光照进了昏暗的房间，笼罩在 NERV 副司令灰白的头发上，将他的影子投射在地板上。由于缺乏食物，他的胃咕咕作响，手腕早已被手铐磨得血肉模糊。慢慢地，他的眼睛睁开，从昏昏欲睡的状态中惊醒，因为回响的脚步声在房间里回荡。“抱歉我来晚了。我得让外面的守卫暂时睡一会儿。” 加持的声音对冬月来说既是惊喜也是福音。

"You understand that you're not likely to get out of this alive, you know?" Though Fuyutsuki wasn't going to complain about Kaji freeing him, a friendly warning was something he could do.  
"你知道你很可能没法活着离开这里，对吧？" 虽然不打算对加持救他一事抱怨，但友善的提醒是他能做的。

"I just want to know the truth. After all this, people who want to kill me have to get in line." Even though he was loomed over by the darkness of the situation, Kaji somehow still kept his smirk on his face. "Besides, I'm already a dead man, anyway. It seems SEELE had found out that it was me who diverted the sample of Adam to Commander Ikari."  
"我只是想知道真相。经历了这一切，想杀我的人也得排队。" 尽管被局势的黑暗笼罩，加持不知怎的仍保持着他的微笑。"再说了，反正我已经是个死人了。SEELE 似乎已经发现是我将亚当样本转移给了碇司令。"

Once Kaji helped him get rid of the handcuffs, Fuyutsuki rubbed his swollen wrists, trying to get the feeling back in them. After massaging his wrists and stretching his body, he turned his head to the ponytailed man who just saved him. "Well, I'll be ever so grateful." He smiled a small smile. "It seemed like they just want to keep me locked in here and let me die."  
加持帮他解开手铐后，冬月揉搓着肿胀的手腕，试图恢复知觉。按摩手腕并伸展身体后，他转向刚刚救了他的马尾男子。"好吧，我会永远感激。" 他微微一笑。"看来他们只是想把我关在这里，让我自生自灭。"

"You're not wrong." Kaji shrugged.  
"你没错。" 加持耸了耸肩。

"Figures." He sighed, kicking his legs so blood would run into them again. "So what are you going to do now?"  
“真是的。”他叹了口气，踢了踢腿让血液重新流通。“那你现在打算怎么办？”

"Well," Kaji kept a grin on his face. "I still have one more phone call to make."  
“嗯，”加持保持着脸上的笑容。“我还有一通电话要打。”

"Phone call? You're really nonchalant about your fate, aren't you?" Fuyutsuki raised an eyebrow, his voice not necessarily sympathetic, though he tried his best to not sound cold. After all, Kaji had just saved his life. "Or you just accept it?"  
“打电话？你对自己的命运倒是挺无所谓的，不是吗？”冬月挑了挑眉，语气虽不带同情，但也尽力不显得冷漠。毕竟，加持刚刚救了他一命。“还是说你已经接受了？”

Kaji shrugged. "I guess it's not much of a difference in the end. If SEELE gets what they want, we're all going to die, anyway."  
加持耸了耸肩。“我想最终也没什么区别。如果 SEELE 得到了他们想要的，我们反正都得死。”

"Hm. I guess you're not wrong." Fuyutsuki turned his look to the exit after scanning around the interrogation room for the last time. "Well, I'm leaving. Take care."  
“嗯，我想你说的没错。”冬月将目光转向出口，最后一次扫视审讯室。“好了，我要走了。保重。”

"Go ahead." Kaji replied. "I need to make the phone call while I still can." He let out a light chuckle, though this time, it did carry a slight insincerity.  
“去吧。”加持回答道，“我得趁还能打的时候打个电话。”他轻笑一声，尽管这次，笑声中带着一丝不真诚。

The Sub-Commander met Kaji's eyes with his own, giving him a slight nod. "Thank you, Kaji." The elderly man said before passing by him, hobbling out into the white light that shone in from the doorway, his silhouette grew smaller as he walked away from the confinement room.  
副司令与加持的目光相遇，微微点头。“谢谢你，加持。”老人说道，随后从他身边走过，蹒跚地步入从门口射入的白色光芒中，他的身影随着远离禁闭室而逐渐缩小。

The ponytailed man smirked as he watched the Sub-Commander make his leave before pulling out his cell phone. Though before he could reach Misato's number, the name of another person showed up. "Well, I guess I'll have to make one more phone call." Kaji muttered to himself and dialed the number.  
马尾男子看着副司令离开后，嘴角勾起一抹微笑，随即掏出手机。然而在他拨通美里号码之前，另一个人的名字出现在屏幕上。“好吧，看来还得再打一个电话。”加持自言自语着，拨通了号码。

Shinji stared at his own image reflected on the mirror as he splashed cold water all over his face. Things that had happened recently had been quickly building up in pressure, and the fact that he had the detonator that held Asuka's life didn't help, if not making it worse. His torrent of thoughts was broken by the feeling of his phone vibrating in his pocket. With a sigh, he reached in and pulled it out to see who was calling him.  
真嗣盯着镜中自己的倒影，将冷水泼洒在脸上。最近发生的事情迅速积压成压力，而他手中握有决定明日香生死的引爆器，这无疑使情况更加糟糕。他的思绪被口袋里手机的震动打断。叹了口气，他伸手掏出手机，查看是谁打来的电话。

Raising a surprised eyebrow as he saw the name on the phone, Shinji quickly accepted the call. "Hello, Kaji-san?"  
看到手机上的名字，真嗣惊讶地挑起眉毛，迅速接听了电话。"喂，加持先生？"

"Hey Shinji-kun." His voice came through the speaker, slightly muffled through the old microphone on his phone. He had told him numerous times that he needed to get a new one, but for one reason or another, he just never did.  
"嘿，真嗣君。" 他的声音通过手机老旧的麦克风传来，略显模糊。他曾多次告诉他需要换一个新的，但由于种种原因，他始终没有这么做。

"What's wrong?" Shinji could hear him snicker before he replied.  
“怎么了？”真嗣能听到他在窃笑，随后才回答。

"Nothing's wrong Shinji-kun." He answered. "I just wanted to call and let you know that I might be leaving for a little while. They need me back in Germany, and I don't know when I'll be coming back."  
“没什么事，真嗣君。”他回答道，“我只是想打电话告诉你，我可能要离开一段时间。他们需要我回德国，我不知道什么时候能回来。”

Shinji gasped. How came he could forget about the ministrations the triple-spy was pulling off behind the scenes? Maybe the whole mess with Ireul had taken over all of his spiritual power. "Kaji-san, you're not going to Germany, are you?"  
真嗣倒吸一口凉气。他怎么忘了这个三重间谍在幕后所做的一切？也许伊留尔那档子事已经占据了他所有的精神力量。“加持先生，你不会真的要去德国吧？”

Even though separated by the speakers, he could still hear Kaji blink in surprise. "Perhaps, perhaps not." He finally replied after a long-lasting silence. "Though I want to ask…do you know anything about Asuka?" He had to know. The condition of the redhead was something that kept gawking at him. He would die with a grievance not knowing about her, and for some reason, he felt if anyone knew about her, it would be Shinji, other than the Commander.  
尽管隔着电话，他仍能感觉到加持在惊讶中眨眼。“或许会，或许不会。”长时间的沉默后，他终于回答，“不过我想问……你知道关于明日香的事吗？”他必须知道。那个红发女孩的状况一直困扰着他。如果不知道她的消息，他会带着遗憾死去，而不知为何，他觉得如果有人知道她的消息，那一定是真嗣，而不是司令。

"She's…fine and being taken care of." Shinji forced out a reply. Knowing the imminent fate of the spy, the last thing he could do was to at least let Kaji rest assured.  
“她……没事，正在被照顾。” 真嗣勉强挤出一个回答。明知间谍即将面临的命运，他至少能让加持安心。

He could hear Kaji let out a small sigh of content. Maybe asking Misato to search for the truth was unnecessary, after all. "That's good to hear." He paused for a moment. "Shinji, I need you to promise me something."  
他听到加持发出了一声小小的满足叹息。或许让美里去追查真相终究是多余的。“听到这个消息真好。”他停顿了一下。“真嗣，我需要你答应我一件事。”

"Yes, Kaji-san?" “好的，加持先生？”

"Take good care of Asuka. Please."  
"请好好照顾明日香。拜托了。"

Shinji felt soreness rise inside his chest. He had rarely heard the special inspector say such a phrase before, and when he did, it meant he knew there wasn't much time left for him. "I will." His firm response came out without hesitation.  
真嗣感到胸口一阵酸楚。他很少听到这位特别检察官说出这样的话，而一旦说了，就意味着他知道自己时日无多了。“我会的。”他坚定地回答，毫不犹豫。

"Thanks. Bye, Shinji." "谢谢。再见，真嗣。"

"Bye, Kaji-san…" Shinji sighed as he heard Kaji hang up the phone. He really wanted to help Kaji and avoid him from getting killed, but since he had an agreement with his father, that he shall not question his decisions unless it's related to Asuka, he couldn't do anything about it.  
“再见，加持先生……” 真嗣叹息着，听到加持挂断了电话。他真的很想帮助加持，避免他遭遇不测，但由于与父亲有约在先，除非事关明日香，否则不得质疑他的决定，他对此无能为力。

Maybe if he had realized Kaji's situation earlier, he could've warned him, and perhaps it would help him get out. But knowing how determined he was in finding out the truth, Shinji suspected even if he told him everything about the Second Impact and SEELE, Kaji would still continue his doomed information-gathering crusade.  
或许如果他能更早意识到加持的处境，就能提前警告他，也许能助他脱险。但考虑到加持对探寻真相的执着，真嗣怀疑即便自己将第二次冲击和 SEELE 的一切都告诉他，加持仍会继续他那注定失败的情报搜集之旅。

He had the first-hand experience, after all.  
毕竟，他有过切身的经历。

Shinji silently blessed the best of luck to the special inspector and headed back to Asuka's room.  
真嗣默默地为那位特别检察官祈求好运，然后返回了明日香的房间。

He needed to help Asuka settle down first, then find Misato as soon as possible.  
他需要先帮助明日香安定下来，然后尽快找到美里。

Kaji dropped his phone on the ground of the dull room before firmly bringing his foot down onto it and smashing the device into pieces. In hindsight, it might've been the best for Misato to not answer his call since he didn't think he would be able to stand hearing Misato cry. After making sure all the tracking devices were fried, he exited the darkened room and headed to his office.  
加治将手机丢在昏暗房间的地板上，随即坚定地一脚踩下，将设备碾成碎片。事后想来，或许美里不接他的电话才是最好的，因为他觉得自己无法忍受听到美里哭泣的声音。确认所有追踪装置都已失效后，他走出昏暗的房间，前往自己的办公室。

Once inside, he quickly shut the door behind him, opened his workstation, and started deleting everything related to his field of work. Though not long after, he deemed it more convenient to just format the whole disk drive and smash everything into pieces. Even though he was pretty sure only death awaited him, he couldn't let anyone else into trouble, especially Misato.  
一进门，他迅速关上身后的大门，打开工作站，开始删除与他工作领域相关的所有内容。但不久后，他觉得直接格式化整个磁盘驱动器并将一切砸成碎片更为便捷。尽管他确信自己难逃一死，但他不能让其他人陷入麻烦，尤其是美里。

As he made his way down the empty halls of NERV HQ, he could hear the faint sound of footsteps following in the distance behind him. At first he had hoped the person was only one of the technicians and picked up his pace, hoping to get to his car and escape from the death trap. Though he quickly realized his dream was false as the person behind him picked up the pace along with him, now he was sure the person was SEELE's sleeper agent.  
当他穿过 NERV 总部空荡荡的走廊时，能听到远处传来轻微的脚步声。起初他希望那人只是个技术人员，于是加快了步伐，希望能赶到车里逃离这个死亡陷阱。然而他很快意识到这只是幻想，因为身后的人也加快了脚步，现在他确信那人是 SEELE 的潜伏特工。

As he almost started running, though, Kaji could hear footsteps coming in front of him just around the next corner. He sighed and stopped running. With one assassin behind him and another coming from in front of him, he had no way to escape.  
就在他几乎要开始奔跑时，加持听到前方拐角处传来了脚步声。他叹了口气，停下了脚步。身后有一个刺客，前方又有人迎面而来，他无处可逃。

He looked to his right and saw a giant fan blade slowly spinning, circulating air from the Geofront into NERV Headquarters. As the blade rotated, he could feel a gust of air brush across his face while the sets of footsteps grew closer to him. Sighing, he leaned against the wall and turned his head to look at the assassin.  
他向右望去，只见一个巨大的风扇叶片缓缓旋转，将地底都市的空气循环至 NERV 总部。随着叶片转动，他能感受到一阵阵风轻拂过脸颊，而那串脚步声也愈发逼近。他叹了口气，倚墙而立，转头望向那名刺客。

"Yo, you're kinda late, aren't you?" Kaji spoke, making one last smirk.  
“哟，你有点迟到了，不是吗？”卡吉说着，最后一次咧嘴一笑。

第三十四章：不可饶恕**

_"Misato, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message after I've caused you so much trouble. I'm sorry. Please tell Asuka and Shinji that I'm sorry. And there's one more thing. I've been trying to grow some watermelons. I'd appreciate it if you could water them for me. Shinji knows where they're at. And please don't dwell on the past. Just move ahead. And if somehow I can see you again, I will say the words that I couldn't say eight years ago… Goodbye."  
美里，是我。我确信你听到这条留言时，我已经给你带来了许多麻烦。对不起。请告诉明日香和真嗣，我也很抱歉。还有一件事。我一直在尝试种些西瓜。如果你能帮我浇浇水，我将感激不尽。真嗣知道它们在哪里。请不要沉溺于过去。向前看。如果我还能再见到你，我会说出八年前没能说出口的话……再见。_

Misato leaned against the hallway wall of NERV HQ; tears flowed down her face like a running stream. During the last few days, she had immersed herself into seeking the truth, so when a new message arrived on her phone, she didn't even have time to check it.  
美里靠在 NERV 总部的走廊墙上，泪水如溪流般顺着脸颊流淌。过去的几天里，她全身心投入到追寻真相中，以至于当手机上收到一条新消息时，她甚至来不及查看。

Now that she finally caught a break, Kaji's last words flushed away all of her other concerns in an instant.  
如今她终于得以喘息，但加持的最后一句话瞬间冲散了她所有的其他忧虑。

Misato knew the espionage activities Kaji was partaking in, though she didn't attempt to stop him, even though she was aware of the risks – she also wanted to know the truth herself.  
尽管知道加持参与的间谍活动，Misato 从未试图阻止他，即便她清楚其中的风险——她也渴望自己揭开真相。

Now though, only after the loss, she felt how stupid she was.  
然而，只有在失去之后，她才感到自己是多么愚蠢。

She didn't want to believe it. She didn't want to accept that her lover had been killed, and in a way she was still hanging onto that hope. A body hadn't been presented to her, and with that came a sense of misplaced optimism. However, this message all but sealed the deal. Kaji was dead, and there was nothing she could do to change that.  
她不愿相信。她不愿接受她的爱人已经遇害，内心仍紧抓着那一丝希望。没有遗体呈现在她面前，这带来了一种错位的乐观感。然而，这条留言几乎成了定局。加持已经离世，她无力改变这一事实。

Feeling closing in footsteps behind her, Misato turned around red-eyed, just to see Shinji Ikari approaching in a discreet manner. She hastily wiped out the tears away from her face in a vain attempt to hide them, but it was too late.  
感觉到身后逼近的脚步声，美里红着眼眶转过身，只见真嗣小心翼翼地走近。她匆忙擦去脸上的泪水，试图掩饰，但为时已晚。

"Misato-san…are you alright?"  
"美里小姐…你还好吗？"

"Shinji…" Misato tried to regain a semblance of order, straightening up her clothes. She had numerous questions she wanted to ask him, but now she was not in the mood. "If you don't mind, I'd like to just be left alone right now."  
"真嗣…" 美里试图恢复些许镇定，整理了一下衣服。她有许多问题想问他，但此刻她没有心情。"如果你不介意，我现在只想一个人待着。"

Shinji let out a silent sigh, knowing how hard it had always been for Misato to accept Kaji's decease. "Misato-san…" He needed a way to cheer her up. "Erm, I want you to know that…Asuka is getting better right now; maybe they'll let her go home in a few days."  
真嗣无声地叹了口气，深知美里一直难以接受加持的离世。“美里小姐……”他需要想办法让她振作起来。“呃，我想让你知道……明日香现在正在好转；也许过几天他们就会让她回家了。”

Misato let out a chukle. Just days ago they had a big fight about this topic. She had been doubting herself ever since. Did she care about the children as much as she cared about defeating the Angels? What if Shinji was actually right?  
美里轻声笑了出来。就在几天前，他们还为此大吵了一架。自那以后，她一直在怀疑自己。她对孩子们的关心是否与击败使徒的决心一样强烈？如果真嗣实际上是对的，那该怎么办？

She had thought Shinji and Asuka's relationship was nothing more than puppy love that could be broken in need of the greater good. It was only after she lost Kaji she started to realize how much of an impossibility it was to ask Shinji to give Asuka's life to another person.  
她曾以为真嗣和明日香的关系不过是青春期的小打小闹，为了更大的利益可以轻易打破。直到她失去了加持，才开始意识到要求真嗣为了他人牺牲明日香的生命是多么不可能的事。

After all, she would never want to give Kaji's life to others.  
毕竟，她绝不会愿意将加持的生命交给别人。

"I'm...glad to hear that." Misato brought up the best smile she could. "And...sorry about earlier. I thought I knew what she meant to you, but I was wrong."  
“我……很高兴听到你这么说。”美里尽力挤出了一个最好的笑容，“还有……之前的事，对不起。我以为我知道她对你意味着什么，但我错了。”

Shinji smiled warmly. "Apology accepted, Misato-san. Do you need...tissue?"  
真嗣温暖地笑了。“道歉接受，美里小姐。你需要……纸巾吗？”

"Nah. I'll be fine." She lied. "If Asuka's being released pretty soon, I'm looking forward to have our little family back! Pen-Pen's missing you guys."  
“不用了。我会没事的。”她撒了个谎。“如果明日香很快就能出院，我期待着我们的小家庭重新团聚！Pen-Pen 也很想念你们。”

"Figures..." Shinji chuckled. "I didn't know penguins could bark until I saw him eating your cooking."  
“果然……”真嗣轻声笑道。“我以前不知道企鹅会叫，直到我看到他吃你做的饭。”

"My cooking isn't _that_ bad!" Misato's laughter broke out from her tears, even though it was only temporary. "I really should-"  
"我的厨艺没那么糟糕吧！" 美里含泪笑出声来，尽管这笑声只是暂时的。"我真的应该——"

She was cut off as every alarm in the Geofront blared. It was the Angel alarm.  
她的话被地底都市所有警报的轰鸣声打断。那是天使警报。

"Oh my God!" Major Katsuragi gasped at the sight presented on the monitor. Through the HD imagery filmed by the cameras on the satellites, people on the command deck could see a rather large double-winged creature that glowed in a holy way, staying stationary in the upper atmosphere.  
“哦，我的天哪！”葛城美里少校在监视器上看到的景象让她倒吸一口凉气。通过卫星上的高清摄像头拍摄的图像，指挥甲板上的人们可以看到一个相当巨大的双翼生物，以一种神圣的方式发光，静止在大气层上方。

"It's been circling Earth's orbit for a while, though I can't understand how it's able to change its speed without apparent acceleration or deceleration. Our satellites are only able to pick it up after it stopped there." Maya explained as she made a few more keystrokes. "It's also been flying far out of range for standard weapons, so we have already prepared the positron sniper rifle for Unit 00, and the proton cannon for Unit 01. Unit 02 will be on standby."  
“它已经在地球轨道上盘旋了一段时间，尽管我不明白它是如何在没有明显加速或减速的情况下改变速度的。我们的卫星只有在它停在那里后才能捕捉到它。”玛雅解释道，同时又敲了几下键盘。“它也一直飞得远远超出常规武器的射程，所以我们已经为零号机准备了阳电子狙击步枪，为初号机准备了质子加农炮。二号机将处于待命状态。”

"Asuka's not being deployed?" Misato asked.  
"明日香不会被部署吗？" 美里问道。

"Pilot Soryu's still recovering."  
"丽仍然在恢复中。"

"Right." Misato took a deep breath. "EVAs launch!"  
"明白了。" 美里深吸一口气。"EVA，出击！"

Unit 01 and Unit 00 shot up from the base. Topside, the purple Evangelion sprung out of the elevator, taking position atop a large hill overlooking Tokyo-3. The overcast stretched out as far as he could see, and the rain was pouring. Flipping through his monitors, Shinji switched to lowlight vision. This way he could see through the sick clouds.  
初号机和零号机从基地一跃而出。地面上，紫色的福音战士从电梯中弹射出来，占据了一座俯瞰第三新东京市的大山丘。乌云密布，视野所及之处尽是阴霾，大雨倾盆而下。真嗣翻阅着监视器，切换到低光视觉模式。这样他就能透过病态的云层看清一切。

The purple Unit 01 crouched behind another hill, gripping on the proton cannon tightly. Rising its proton cannon and taking aim on the Angel, Shinji focused on the blue crosshair danced around the screen, circling closer and closer to the glowing beast that soared thousand of miles above him.  
紫色的初号机蹲伏在另一座山丘后，紧紧握住质子炮。真嗣举起质子炮，瞄准使徒，专注地盯着屏幕上跳动的蓝色十字准星，它越来越接近那只在他上方数千英里处翱翔的闪光巨兽。

"I have locked on the target," Shinji held his breath as the crosshair made one more loop around the target before locking onto the core of the Angel, turning from blue to red. He had been tortured by the Angel of Birds before, nonetheless, if there's a possibility, he would never let Asuka go through it ever again.  
“我已经锁定目标了，”真嗣屏住呼吸，十字准星在目标周围再绕一圈后，终于锁定了使徒的核心，从蓝色变为红色。他曾被鸟天使折磨过，尽管如此，如果有任何可能，他绝不会再让明日香经历这一切。

But it didn't help with the fact it was excruciatingly painful, and the fact that he didn't have any solution other than using the Lance of Longinus didn't help things.  
但这并没有减轻那极度痛苦的感受，而且除了使用朗基努斯之枪外，他别无他法，这更让情况雪上加霜。

"Firing." Just as Unit 01 begun to squeeze its finger on the trigger, his screen was filled with a brilliantly blinding light as the Angel started to glow even brighter. From it, a beam of light shot down from the Angel and pierced through the clouds as it shone down onto the purple Evangelion.  
"发射。" 就在 01 号机开始扣动扳机的那一刻，他的屏幕被一道耀眼至极的光芒填满，天使开始发出更加明亮的光辉。从天使身上，一道光束射出，穿透云层，照耀在紫色的福音战士上。

Shinji started to scream.  
真嗣开始尖叫。

"What's happening? Shinji, pull back!" Misato's rushed to the microphone. "What's the Angel doing to him?!"  
“发生了什么？真嗣，撤退！”美里急忙冲向麦克风。“使徒对他做了什么？！”

"Oh my god!" Dr. Akagi exclaimed as she saw the turmoil that's Shinji's brainwave chart. "His brain wave activity is all over the place! If this keeps up, he's likely lose his mind!"  
“哦，天哪！”赤木博士惊呼，她看到真嗣的脑波图一片混乱。“他的脑波活动完全失控了！如果这种情况持续下去，他很可能会精神崩溃！”

"Oh God…" Misato felt a tug at her heart. She couldn't believe this was happening. "Shinji, retreat! Get the hell out of there!"  
“哦，上帝…”美里感到心被揪了一下。她无法相信这一切正在发生。“真嗣，撤退！快离开那里！”

"That's not going to happen." Makoto gulped. "His sync rate has dropped to four percent. He couldn't move his EVA even if he wanted to."  
“那是不可能的。”真嗣咽了口唾沫。“他的同步率已经下降到百分之四了。即使他想，他也无法移动他的 EVA。”

"Are you saying that the Angel isn't targeting Unit 01, but it's attacking…"  
"你的意思是，使徒并没有锁定初号机，而是在攻击……"

"Shinji." Dr. Akagi finished. "It's trying to read Shinji's mind… It's trying to understand his psychology by digging through his mind." She sounded almost as if she were at a loss for words. Astonished wouldn't have been the right word, but disbelievingly horrified fit perfectly.  
“真嗣。”赤木博士结束了发言。“它试图读取真嗣的思维……它试图通过深入他的内心来理解他的心理。”她听起来几乎像是无言以对。惊讶这个词并不恰当，但难以置信的恐惧却恰如其分。

"Rei, take the shot!" "丽，开火！"

"Roger." Unit 00 unloaded a round from the now fully powered positron rifle, sending a giant gauss powered bullet across the sky, arcing around the curvature of the planet. Her aim was perfect, the round hit directly in the center of the Angel's core. However its AT-Field prevented it from penetrating, shattering it into four separate chunks.  
"收到。" 零号机从现已完全充能的阳电子步枪中射出一发巨型高斯动力子弹，子弹划过天际，绕过地球的曲率。她的瞄准完美无缺，子弹正中使徒核心。然而，其 AT 力场阻止了子弹的穿透，将其碎裂成四块。

"Its AT-Field is too powerful!" Aoba exclaimed. "We can't hit it from this range!"  
"它的 AT 力场太强了！" 青叶惊呼。"我们在这个距离无法击中它！"

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

Shinji's eyes fluttered open grudgingly, just to see a starry sky flashing above him. He could see a white moon hanging in the sky and hear the soft sound of water slapping the beach. Grumbling as he tried to get up, he turned his head to his side, gasping as he settled his eyes on the person lying beside him.  
真嗣不情愿地眨开眼睛，只见繁星点点的夜空在他上方闪烁。他能看到天空中悬挂着一轮皎洁的月亮，听见海水轻拍沙滩的柔和声响。他一边嘟囔着试图起身，一边转头向旁边看去，当他看清躺在身旁的人时，不禁倒吸了一口气。

Red plug suit. Bandages on her right arm and left eye.  
红色插入栓服。右臂和左眼缠着绷带。

"No…no no no no…" Shinji muttered, instinctively trying to get away from the scene. Though he couldn't seem to control his own body. "Don't make me remember this…"  
“不…不不不不…” 真嗣喃喃自语，本能地试图逃离这一幕。尽管他似乎无法控制自己的身体。“别让我回忆这个…”

He summoned all of his willpower in a futile attempt just to move his body away, just to hopelessly watch his hands clasped around the redhead's slender neck.  
他竭尽全力试图只是移动身体远离，只是绝望地看着自己的双手紧扣在红发少女纤细的脖颈上。

"No!" Although he couldn't remember his emotions at that time, the pressure was weighing on him like a mountain, making him suffocate as the scene continued to play out in front of his eyes.  
“不！”尽管他无法回忆起当时的情绪，但那股压力如山般压在他身上，随着眼前的场景不断上演，他感到窒息。

He desperately wanted to pull his hands away from her neck, but they started to apply more force nonetheless. "No! I didn't want to do this! Don't make me do this!"  
他拼命想从她的脖子上抽回双手，但它们却开始施加更多的力量。“不！我不想这么做！别逼我这么做！”

He could see Asuka's lips twisted as he exerted more power strangling her. Slowly, her right bandaged hand lifted up from the beach and reached his left cheek.  
他能看到明日香的双唇因窒息而扭曲，随着他加大力道。慢慢地，她那只缠着绷带的右手从沙滩上抬起，触碰到了他的左脸颊。

It was the warm sensation again. The caress.  
又是那种温暖的感觉。那轻抚。

Shinji hesitated. 真嗣犹豫了。

Looking directly into her blue eyes, he could see life was slowly slipping away from her body. Though his hands were still around her neck.  
他直视着她蓝色的眼睛，能看到生命正慢慢从她体内流逝。尽管他的双手仍环绕在她的脖子上。

A tear rolled down her face.  
一滴泪珠从她的脸颊滑落。

Her hands fell. 她的双手垂落。

Shinji saw himself retract his hands as if shocked by electricity.  
真嗣看到自己仿佛被电击般缩回了双手。

"Asuka…?" “明日香…？”

Silence. 沉默。

Her eyes went unfocused. 她的眼神变得迷离。

With a trembling hand, Shinji reached out to her nose.  
颤抖着手，真嗣伸向她的鼻尖。

Nothing. 什么都没有。

Though he could still feel her remaining body heat slipping through her plugsuit.  
尽管他仍能感受到她插装服下残留的体温逐渐消散。

"NOOOOO!" Shinji screamed. He saw himself stumbling away from the spot with an utterly horrified expression. "I don't want to remember this! Please don't make me remember!"  
"不！！！" 真嗣尖叫道。他看到自己踉踉跄跄地逃离那个地方，脸上满是极度惊恐的表情。"我不想记起这些！请不要让我记起来！"

_What did you do? 你做了什么？_

"Noooo! I didn't want to!"  
“不！我不想这样！”

_It's what you have done. You are a monster.  
这就是你所做的。你是个怪物。_

Shinji saw himself slowly walking back to the side of Asuka's lifeless body with shaking legs. He knelt down beside her, and sobbed.  
真嗣看到自己颤抖着双腿，缓缓走回明日香毫无生气的身体旁。他跪在她身边，啜泣起来。

_Murderer! “杀人犯！”_

Shinji buried his face in the Asuka's stomach, letting tears flow out freely from his eyes.  
“真嗣将脸埋在明日香的腹部，任由泪水从眼中自由流淌。”

_You'll never be forgiven…because she's dead.  
你永远不会被原谅……因为她已经死了。_

_You killed her. 你杀了她。_

"I didn't want to! I didn't want to…"  
“我不想的！我不想……”

Slowly, Shinji watched himself stood up after no one knew how long, and carried her body with both of his arms. With heavy steps, the brown-haired boy paced toward the red sea.  
慢慢地，真嗣看着自己不知过了多久后站起身来，用双臂抱起她的身体。棕色头发的男孩步履沉重地向着红海走去。

The only thing he could do, except being overwhelmed by guilt and remorse, was to watch.  
除了被愧疚和悔恨淹没，他唯一能做的就是看着。

Gradually, the sea swallowed his legs. Then his waist. Then his chest, along with Asuka's body.  
渐渐地，海水吞没了他的双腿。接着是他的腰。然后是他的胸膛，连同明日香的身体一起。

Finally, the top of his head disappeared under the calm sea.  
终于，他的头顶消失在平静的海面之下。

_You thought this would've ended your pain? Look at you know.  
你以为这就能结束你的痛苦吗？看看你现在。_

_Pathetic. 可悲。_

"I'm sorry…Asuka… I'm sorry…"  
"对不起…明日香…对不起…"

"Pilot Ikari's synchrograph is off the charts!" Maya reported. "Brain activity decreasing!"  
"碇司令的同步率图表爆表了！" 真希报告道。"脑活动正在下降！"

Above the command deck, Gendo Ikari furrowed his brows. Even though Shinji had told him that the fifteenth Angel had no physical threat to him or the EVAs, it didn't make the whole situation less…concerning.  
在指挥甲板上，碇源堂皱起了眉头。尽管真嗣告诉他第十五使徒对他或 EVA 没有物理威胁，但这并没有让整个情况变得不那么……令人担忧。

Concerning? The scowl on his face deepened as the particular word crept up his mind. What was he concerned about? The EVA itself? Or Yui's soul inside Unit 01?  
担忧？他脸上的皱眉加深了，当这个特定的词浮现在他的脑海中。他在担心什么？是 EVA 本身？还是初号机内的唯的灵魂？

Or was it Shinji?  
还是说是真嗣？

Gendo Ikari almost chuckled as his train of thought reached its final destination. He thought he only cared about Yui. It didn't make sense to him. "It seems there's only one way left."  
碇源堂几乎要轻笑出声，当他的思绪抵达终点站时。他原以为自己只在乎唯。这在他看来毫无道理。“看来只剩下一条路可走了。”

"Ikari?" Fuyutsuki's raised his eyebrows. "You can't be seriously considering…"  
“碇？”冬月挑起了眉毛。“你不会真的在考虑……”

"We don't have other options," Gendo replied flippantly. "The Angel is too far away for us to reach."  
“我们没有其他选择，”碇源堂轻率地回答，“使徒离我们太远了，我们无法到达。”

"How can you make sure to retrieve the Lance afterward? How would you explain it to the old men?" Fuyutsuki questioned, still loomed over by the shadow of SEELE's inevitable power over them, and this time Kaji wouldn't be there to save him again.  
“你怎么确保事后能取回朗基努斯之枪？你又如何向那些老头子解释？”冬月问道，依旧笼罩在 SEELE 不可避免的权力阴影下，而这次加持不会再出现来救他了。

"They will have to accept it." Gendo leaned over to the microphone, not wanting to waste any more time. "Rei, go to Central Dogma and retrieve the Lance. You know what to do."  
“他们必须接受。”碇源堂俯身靠近麦克风，不想再浪费时间。“丽，去中央教条区取回朗基努斯之枪。你知道该怎么做。”

Shinji alone knelt on the flight deck of _Over the Rainbow,_ hyperventilating, the deeply-buried memories still gnawing at him. He didn't want to remember, but he just couldn't forget. The sins, the horrific crimes he had committed against her.  
真嗣独自跪在“跨越彩虹”的飞行甲板上，呼吸急促，深埋的记忆仍在啃噬着他。他不想回忆，却无法忘却。那些罪行，他对她犯下的可怕罪行。

He thought that killing himself would redeem him, but it was only another way of escaping. And he had been paying his debts for God knew how long.  
他以为自杀能赎罪，殊不知这只是另一种逃避。而且他已经为上帝知道多久的时间偿还债务了。

He took everything life threw at him as well-deserved. Still, it wasn't enough.  
他将生活中遭遇的一切都视为理所应当。然而，这还不够。

Suddenly he could feel another presence before him. Slowly raising his head, Shinji saw Asuka in a yellow sundress, her hands on her hips, smirking proudly at him. "Asuka!" He shot up from the deck and dashed forward, extending his arms.  
突然，他感觉到前方有另一个存在。他缓缓抬起头，看到明日香穿着一件黄色太阳裙，双手叉腰，得意地对他冷笑。“明日香！”他从甲板上猛地站起，向前冲去，伸出了双臂。

And then went through her without resistance.  
然后毫无阻碍地穿过了她。

Bewildered, Shinji turned his head back, just to see Asuka turned around as well, still smirking at him. "I am only an image of Asuka in your mind." She spoke.  
困惑中，真嗣转过头，只见明日香也转过身来，依旧对他得意地笑着。“我只是你脑海中明日香的形象。”她开口说道。

"Wha-" Shinji gasped as Asuka snapped her fingers, the empty flight deck suddenly was filled with countless Asukas.  
“什-” 真嗣倒抽一口气，明日香打了个响指，空旷的飞行甲板上突然出现了无数个明日香。

Asuka in a plugsuit. 穿着插入栓服的明日香。

Asuka wearing school uniform.  
穿着校服的明日香。

Asuka with high-heels and black dress.  
穿着高跟鞋和黑色连衣裙的明日香。

A ski suit wearing Asuka.  
穿着滑雪服的明日香。

An eyepatch wearing Asuka.  
戴着眼罩的明日香。

Wearing headsets, holding head low Asuka.  
戴着耳机，低着头的明日香。

Different outfits, slightly different ages.  
不同的服装，略微不同的年龄。

All same identity… 所有人的身份都一样……

"These are us; these are Asuka." The yellow-sundress-wearing Asuka spoke up again. "All Asukas you've met before. And…" Her smirk morphed into a distorted grin. "You've failed every single of us."  
“这些是我们；这些是明日香。”穿着黄色太阳裙的明日香再次开口。“所有你之前遇到的明日香。而且……”她的讥笑扭曲成一个怪异的笑容。“你对我们每一个都失败了。”

"No…" Shinji stumbled back, falling butt-first on the flight deck. "I tried! I did my best!"  
“不……” 真嗣踉跄后退，一屁股跌坐在飞行甲板上。“我试过了！我已经尽力了！”

Every Asuka turned their heads to look at Shinji. "We're merely replacements for you. You never loved us. We're only your tools to reach your so-called pathetic redemption."  
每个明日香都转过头来看着真嗣。“我们只是你的替代品。你从未爱过我们。我们只是你用来达成所谓可悲救赎的工具。”

"Is not! I love you!" Shinji screamed. "You're no different to me!"  
“不是的！我爱你！”真嗣尖叫道。“对我来说你们没有什么不同！”

"Liar." Asuka hissed. "Through the imagery of Asuka…you already know whom your true feelings are for. And… she's dead."  
“骗子。”明日香低声怒斥，“通过明日香的影像……你已经知道你真正的心意指向谁了。而且……她已经死了。”

"Noooo! I can't take this anymore! Please, somebody help me!" Shinji tried to run backward, but he felt his feet out of control as he was dragged forward by an invisible force.  
“不！我再也受不了了！谁来帮帮我！”真嗣试图向后跑，却感到双脚失控，被一股无形的力量拖拽着向前。

_You never loved me. 你从未爱过我。_

_We're only your replacements.  
我们只是你的替代品。_

_I'm not your doll! 我不是你的玩偶！_

_I hate you! 我恨你！_

Shinji screamed. It was a horrifying, twisted, and desperate scream.  
真嗣尖叫起来。那是一种恐怖、扭曲且绝望的尖叫。

And suddenly, everything went dark.  
突然间，一切陷入了黑暗。

"Oh well, that was totally unexpected." A silver-haired boy smirked, standing on a nearby hill and observing the battle intently. Grinning as he saw the Lance of Longinus flew across the ionosphere before piercing the Angel's core without a problem. "The scenario is off the track, though it's still…adaptable. I'm looking forward to meet you…Ikari Shinji-kun."  
"哦，这真是完全出乎意料。" 一个银发少年站在附近的山丘上，嘴角微扬，专注地观察着战斗。当他看到朗基努斯之枪穿越电离层，毫无阻碍地刺穿了使徒的核心时，他露出了笑容。"虽然剧情偏离了轨道，但仍然……可调整。我期待着与你见面……碇真嗣君。"

"How did the fight go? Is Shinji okay?" Dr. Akagi was assaulted by Asuka's storm of inquiries as she came entered room 124. The Angel alarm covered the whole base, even in the deepest part of Central Dogma, the redhead could still make out the familiar dreading yet exciting sound.  
"战斗怎么样了？真嗣还好吗？" 赤木律子博士一进入 124 号房间，就被明日香连珠炮似的问题包围了。使徒警报响彻整个基地，即使在中央教条的最深处，红发少女仍能听到那熟悉却又令人既恐惧又兴奋的声音。

She wasn't allowed to leave the room for obvious reasons, and the fact that Shinji hadn't come back to her for hours - unlike he had promised - only made her more anxious.  
由于显而易见的原因，她不被允许离开房间，而真嗣已经几个小时没有回来找她了——这与他承诺的不同——这让她更加焦虑。

"The Angel was defeated. Shinji…he suffered some damage," Asuka's heart sunk as the words came to her. "There should be nothing for you to worry about, though. He just needs some rest. There weren't any traces of contamination, or anything." Ritsuko's explanations only reminded her of the harsh reality – that she had possession in her precious body.  
“使徒已经被击败了。真嗣……他受了些伤，”听到这些话，明日香的心沉了下去。“不过，你应该不用担心。他只需要休息一下。没有发现任何污染的痕迹。”律子的解释只是让她更加意识到残酷的现实——她的宝贵身体里有着那个存在。

"I want to see him!" Asuka exclaimed, though her tone almost pleading, a stark contrast to her usual haughtiness. "I _need_ to see him!"  
"我想见他！" 明日香喊道，尽管她的语气近乎恳求，与她平时的傲慢形成鲜明对比。"我必须见他！"

"No, we don't know what will happen to your left eye if you leave this room, equipped with Anti-L barrier." Dr. Akagi replied without thinking. "In theory, the…collar and the eyepatch should be enough, but we aren't taking any risks here. Not after I've done necessary tests."  
"不行，我们不知道如果你离开这个配备反 L 屏障的房间，你的左眼会发生什么。" 赤城博士不假思索地回答。"理论上，项圈和眼罩应该足够了，但我们不在这里冒任何风险。尤其是在我进行了必要的测试之后。"

"You can't just keep me here forever! It's already maddening as it is, even with Shinji around!" Asuka barked. "I'd lost my mind if you keep me in here any longer!" As she said, the dim light emitting from her left eye seemed to intensify.  
"你不能永远把我关在这里！即使有真嗣在，这已经够让人发疯了！" 明日香咆哮道。"如果你们再把我关在这里，我会疯掉的！" 正如她所说，从她左眼发出的微弱光芒似乎增强了。

"Calm down Asuka." Ritsuko hastily said, afraid of things going wrong. "You being moody only do bad to your condition."  
"冷静点，明日香。" 律子急忙说道，生怕事情恶化。"你情绪不稳定只会对你的状况不利。"

"But-" She was cut off as another husky older voice started up.  
"但是——" 她话未说完，就被另一个沙哑的成熟声音打断了。

"Let her go, Dr. Akagi."  
"让她去吧，赤城博士。"

Both occupants of the room turned their heads to the direction of the voice, just to see Commander Ikari standing at the entrance of the room, his hands clasped behind his rear as usual.  
房间里的两人同时转向声音的方向，只见碇司令一如既往地双手背在身后，站在门口。

"Do you know what you are talking about, Gendo?" Ritsuko doubted, confused by his behavior. She didn't know where her courage to raise her volume against him came from. Why did he care- or was it care, or something else? – about the Second Child so much?  
“你知道你在说什么吗，碇？”律子怀疑地问道，对他的行为感到困惑。她不知道自己哪来的勇气提高音量对他讲话。他为什么这么关心——或者那真的是关心，还是别的什么？——二号机驾驶员？

She went wide-eyed as her high IQ brain kicked in. He wasn't doing it for the Second Child, but for Shinji.  
她瞪大了眼睛，高智商的大脑开始运转。他不是为了二号机驾驶员，而是为了真嗣。

"We still don't know what will happen if she gets out the Anti-L barrier!" Still, she tried.  
“我们仍然不知道如果她突破反 L 屏障会发生什么！”尽管如此，她还是尝试了。

"That's before you put the stopgap and the DSS Choker on her." Gendo's voice was calm and collected as usual. Shinji hadn't wake up ever since the battle ended, and he was constantly mumbling something. Even though most of the phrases weren't recognizable, 'Asuka' was undoubtedly one of them.  
“那是你给她戴上临时阻断器和 DSS 项圈之前的事了。”源渡的声音一如既往地平静而沉着。真嗣自战斗结束后就一直没有醒来，嘴里不停地念叨着什么。虽然大部分话语都无法辨认，但‘明日香’无疑是其中之一。

He didn't know what he was doing. Taking the Second Child out was indeed risky, but he just couldn't see Shinji – no, he just couldn't lose him, that's all – Gendo tried to convince himself. "Is there more we can do?"  
他不知道自己在做什么。带出二号机驾驶员确实风险很大，但他就是无法看着真嗣——不，他就是不能失去他，仅此而已——源渡试图说服自己。“我们还能做些什么吗？”

"Not really. Except for further tests." Dr. Akagi admitted.  
“其实没有了。除了进一步的测试。”赤木博士承认道。

"Then you have my order. Release the Second Child."  
“那么，我命令你。释放第二适格者。”

Ritsuko sighed. In truth, one of the primary reasons she had kept Asuka in room 124 was to fulfill some of her own curiosities, for example, how Angels interact with human bodies - not to mention her own twisted little revenge. There was a risk, for sure, but sooner than later, she _will_ have to let her go. Not to mention the risk wasn't exactly larger than facing an Angel, anyway.  
律子叹了口气。事实上，她将明日香留在 124 号房间的主要原因之一，是为了满足自己的一些好奇心，比如天使如何与人体互动——更不用说她那扭曲的小小复仇了。当然，这存在风险，但迟早她得放她走。更别提这风险并不比直面使徒大多少。

"Fine. But remember-" “好吧。但记住——”

"I know, I know." Asuka waved her hand, almost losing control of herself to jump in exuberance. "Where is he? I can go there by myself!"  
"我知道，我知道。" 明日香挥了挥手，差点控制不住自己跳起来欢呼。"他在哪儿？我自己能过去！"

"Room 303. Remember, not a word to other people!"  
"303 号房。记住，别跟其他人说！"

"Young people…" Gendo shook his head and sighed as he watched the Second Child burst out of the room.  
"年轻人啊……" 碇源堂摇了摇头，叹息着看向第二适格者冲出房间。

"Shinji!" The electronic door of ward 303 suffered more mild mechanical damage as it was thrown open by the impatient redhead against its designs. "Shinji are you-"  
"真嗣！" 303 病房那扇电子门因被急躁的红发女孩猛地推开，而遭受了轻微的机械损伤，这显然超出了它的设计承受范围。"真嗣，你还好吗——"

Asuka stopped yelling as she saw Misato standing in the room and put one finger on her lips, gesturing her to keep quiet. Though her expression turned utterly surprised after she recognized the new intruder. "Asuka?!" She managed to shout in a whisper, running to the clueless redhead and pulled her into a bear hug. "I'm so glad you're okay!"  
"明日香看到美里站在房间里，便停止了喊叫，用手指轻触嘴唇，示意她保持安静。然而，当她认出这位新闯入者时，表情变得极为惊讶。“明日香？！”她低声惊呼，跑到一脸茫然的红发少女身边，将她紧紧拥入怀中。“我真高兴你没事！””

Misato tensed up, though, as the red-black choker on Asuka's neck came into her field of view. "Asuka…" She started, sadness poured out from her voice.  
"然而，当美里注意到明日香脖子上那条红黑相间的项圈时，她紧张起来。“明日香……”她开口道，声音中流露出深深的悲伤。”

"What's wrong, Misato?" Asuka inquired, slowly stepping back to a talking distance.  
"“怎么了，美里？”明日香问道，缓缓后退到合适的交谈距离。”

Misato shook her head. She wanted to ask was she allowed to be out of room 124, but since she's already here, then it must mean NERV, or at least Dr. Akagi had decided to release her; it would be like asking a waking person if she's awake.  
美里摇了摇头。她本想问自己是否被允许离开 124 号房间，但既然她已经在这里了，那就意味着 NERV，或者至少是赤木博士已经决定让她出来了；这就像问一个醒着的人她是否醒着一样。

"You came here for Shinji, right?" She brought up a smile, but it faded as quickly as it came. "You really came in time. He has been calling your name nonstop. Maybe you can do something about it."  
“你是来找真嗣的，对吧？”她努力挤出一个微笑，但很快就消失了。“你来得真是时候。他一直在不停地喊你的名字。也许你能做点什么。”

With a faint blush, Asuka walked closer to his bedside and sat on the spare chair. Staring at his sleeping form, she could identify the _fear_ that was obviously showed on his face.  
带着一丝微红，明日香走近他的床边，坐在了备用椅子上。凝视着他沉睡的模样，她能清晰地辨认出他脸上明显流露出的恐惧。

Asuka frowned. From her impression, Shinji never feared anything. He was always so headstrong and confident. She leaned closer to his quivering lips.  
明日香皱起了眉头。在她印象中，真嗣从不畏惧任何事。他总是那么固执和自信。她更靠近了他颤抖的嘴唇。

"'m s'ry…' suka…" "'对不起…' 明日香…"

With her eyebrow raised, the redhead started another storm of thoughts in her mind. Why was he apologizing? It was a very uncharacteristic thing for him to do. Not to mention he didn't really do anything to her that would require an apology, right?  
红发少女挑起眉毛，脑海中又掀起了一阵思绪的风暴。他为何要道歉？这完全不像他的作风。更别说他并没有对她做过什么需要道歉的事，对吧？

"… d'nt h'te me…" "… 别讨厌我…"

Asuka blinked. Why would he think that she hated him? Dr. Akagi had said the Angel somehow attacked his mind...Asuka shook it off. As confused as she was, she took the only approach that might work. She took his right hand with both of hers and came close to his right ear. "I don't hate you, Shinji. I love you."  
明日香眨了眨眼。他怎么会觉得她讨厌他呢？赤木博士说过，那个使徒不知怎的攻击了他的心灵...明日香摇了摇头，抛开这些疑惑。尽管她感到困惑，但她采取了唯一可能奏效的方法。她用双手握住他的右手，靠近他的右耳轻声说道：“我不讨厌你，真嗣。我爱你。”

Predictably Shinji slowly calmed down, his expression turned more peaceful with each passing moment. Misato looked at the scene with a slight smile on her face. Maybe their bond was much deeper than she thought – though her smile faded as reality struck her again.  
不出所料，真嗣渐渐平静下来，他的表情随着时间的推移变得更加平和。美里看着这一幕，脸上露出一丝微笑。也许他们的关系比她想象的要深得多——尽管当现实再次击中她时，她的微笑消失了。

Misato felt her chest sored as the image of another man crept up her mind, and the adorable scene in front of her didn't help soothe it by much. There was only one course of action before her to follow – pick up where Kaji left behind to let him rest in peace.  
美里感到胸口一阵刺痛，另一个男人的形象悄然浮现在她的脑海中，眼前这可爱的场景并没有多大帮助缓解这种感觉。她面前只有一个行动方案——继续卡吉留下的工作，让他安息。

**Chapter 35: Introspection  
第 35 章：内省**

"Well, nothing's changed during the period you were outside of the Anti-L barrier. You can go home if you want." Ritsuko's final decision sounded like a pleasant melody to Asuka, who squeaked like a schoolgirl and jumped from her spot.  
“嗯，你离开反 L 屏障期间，一切都没有变化。如果你想的话，可以回家。”律子的最终决定对明日香来说犹如悦耳的旋律，她像个小女生一样尖叫着从原地跳了起来。

The past few days had been depressing, to say the least. Shinji woke up not long after her comforting him, though he was surprised to see her there at his bedside at first. After some quick explanations, he accepted the arrangement with delight – he wanted her out of there as soon as possible himself, after all.  
过去几天，至少可以说，是压抑的。真嗣在她安慰他后不久就醒了，起初他对她在床边感到惊讶。经过一些快速的解释，他高兴地接受了安排——毕竟，他自己也希望她尽快离开那里。

Now her observation period was finally over; she was looking forward to having normal – or rather, relatively normal – life once again, and meet her friends – however slowly becoming increasingly unimportant to her - at school.  
现在她的观察期终于结束了；她期待着再次过上正常——或者说相对正常——的生活，并在学校与她的朋友们见面——尽管她们对她来说越来越不重要。

"Is there anything that I should be careful with?" Asuka probed, still worrying about the Angelic possession.  
“有什么我需要注意的吗？”明日香试探地问，仍然担心天使的附身。

"As long as you don't take the eyepatch off, you'll be fine." Dr. Akagi replied.  
“只要你别摘下眼罩，就不会有事。”赤木律子博士回答道。

"What if I do?" Seeing the incredulous glare from Ritsuko, Asuka hastily reiterated, "I mean, what if it falls off? Or some random morons snatch it off?"  
“如果我摘了呢？”看到律子难以置信的目光，惣流急忙补充道，“我是说，万一它自己掉了呢？或者一些无聊的家伙把它抢走怎么办？”

"Then we'd have to explain how we got a whole school of kids killed to their parents and the UN." An unreadable expression crossed the blonde doctor's face, though Asuka could clearly see a hint of amusement in it.  
“那我们就得向孩子们的父母和联合国解释，我们是怎么让整个学校的孩子丧命的。”金发女博士脸上掠过一丝难以捉摸的表情，但惣流清楚地捕捉到了其中的戏谑之意。

"Doctor?" Asuka questioned, her tone nervous.  
"医生？" 明日香问道，语气中带着紧张。

"Relax." Dr. Akagi smirked. "It's not like you will turn into an Angel _immediately_ after it falls off. You'll have time to fix it. We'll also strengthen Section 2 coverage around you guys. With your hand-to-hand combat training, it's not like people can just _come and get to you,_ right?"  
"放松。" 赤城博士微微一笑。"它掉下来也不会让你立刻变成使徒。你有时间修复它。我们还会加强你们周围的第二区域覆盖。以你的近战训练，别人不可能轻易接近你，对吧？"

"Of course." Asuka held her head up, feeling a note of pride for the first time in a long while.  
"当然。" 明日香抬起头，久违地感到一丝自豪。

"And you still have…the last resort." Ritsuko's tone suddenly turned dead serious.  
"而且你还有…最后的手段。" 律子的语气突然变得极其严肃。

The redhead's expression darkened in an eyeblink. "Yeah…" She sulked. Even though she didn't want to admit it, the ultimate decision was still held in her hands. She wasn't afraid of death herself, but she was dreading how much of a pain she would inflict on Shinji if she did.  
红发少女的表情在眨眼间阴沉下来。“是啊……”她闷闷不乐。尽管她不想承认，但最终决定权仍掌握在她手中。她自己并不怕死，但她害怕会给真嗣带来多大的痛苦，如果她真的那样做的话。

Asuka bit down on her lips. There was one way she knew she could console him, and she intended to persuade him to do it. She was sure he would accept her under her current state.  
明日香咬紧了嘴唇。她知道有一种方法可以安慰他，并打算说服他去做。她确信，以她目前的状态，他会接受她的。

"You have the intel I gave you. You know what to do." A cold, husky voice sounded in the dark office. ''You're alive only because I have a use of you."  
“你手上有我给的情报。你知道该怎么做。”一个冷酷而沙哑的声音在昏暗的办公室里响起。“你活着只是因为我还有用得着你的地方。”

"I know." With that, a hunk of a ponytailed man nodded and left the room.  
“我知道。”话音刚落，一位扎着马尾的魁梧男子点头后离开了房间。

Asuka settled herself into a comfortable position in bed, letting out a content moan as she snuggled closer to Shinji, making the contacting surface area as large as possible. This was what she craved and had been denied until recently – him taking care of her was nice, but the feeling of another person she trusted holding her, loving her, was what swiped her loneliness and insecurities away.  
明日香在床上找了个舒服的姿势躺下，满足地呻吟一声，更紧地依偎向真嗣，尽可能扩大接触面积。这就是她一直渴望却直到最近才得到的——他的照顾固然美好，但那份来自她信任的人的拥抱和爱意，才是真正驱散她孤独与不安的力量。

Though she couldn't help but notice Shinji had been tenser than usual. She wanted to shake it off as a normal reaction for their first night spent together back in their apartment, but it was clear he had something else on his mind nagging at him.  
尽管她注意到真嗣比平时更加紧张。她本想将其归咎于他们久别重逢后共度的第一夜，但显然他心中有其他事情在困扰着他。

"Shinji, do you find me not attractive anymore?" Asuka inquired as dark thoughts stroke back at her at full force.  
"真嗣，你觉得我不再有吸引力了吗？" 明日香问道，黑暗的思绪再次猛烈地袭来。

"Hm? Asuka, I never find you unattractive. Why ask?" Shinji said, his voice muffled by her hair.  
"嗯？明日香，我从没觉得你没吸引力。为什么这么问？" 真嗣说道，声音被她的头发遮住了。

"Because…you seem to have a lot on your mind," Asuka let the words flow out slowly.  
"因为……你似乎心事重重，" 明日香缓缓地说出这些话。

"It's..." He pondered for a moment. "It's the Angel," Shinji sighed. "It...attacked my mind. It let me live in my darkest fears...of losing you. I-I can't-" He took a deep breath. "Asuka, there's something I need to-"  
“这是……”他沉思片刻，“是使徒，”真嗣叹息道，“它……攻击了我的心灵。让我活在我最深的恐惧中……失去你。我……我不能……”他深吸一口气，“明日香，有件事我必须……”

"Shinji," Asuka cut him off by putting her index finger on his lips. "You've helped me with this before...now it's my turn to comfort you." She grinned, a seductive smile crossed her face. "I want you, tonight. I don't know what stopped you before, but are you ready now? Anything else can wait." With that, Asuka slowly took off the flimsy nightshirt, exposing her perfectly sculptured body.  
“真嗣，”明日香用食指按住他的嘴唇打断了他，“你之前帮过我……现在轮到我来安慰你了。”她咧嘴一笑，脸上掠过一抹诱人的微笑，“今晚我想要你。我不知道之前是什么阻止了你，但现在你准备好了吗？其他的事都可以等。”说完，明日香缓缓脱下那件单薄的睡衣，露出她完美雕塑般的身躯。

Shinji's eyes widened as the dark memories struck back again.  
真嗣的眼睛因黑暗的记忆再次袭来而睁大了。

_You're just using me as your replacement!  
“你只是把我当作你的替代品！”_

"Asuka, I-" “明日香，我——”

"Shinji," again he was cut off by a firm voice. "Even if you don't want to, do it for _me_, okay?" Asuka smiled. "It may sound shameful…but I almost died weeks ago, and I don't want to die as virgin, Shinji."  
“真嗣，”他又被一个坚定的声音打断了。“即使你不愿意，为了我，好吗？”明日香微笑着。“这听起来可能很羞耻……但几周前我差点死了，我不想作为一个处女死去，真嗣。”

_I hate you! 我恨你！_

"And…I love you. So, I want you…all of you."  
“而且…我爱你。所以，我想要你…全部的你。”

Taking another deep inhale, Shinji closed his eyes before a small smile grew on his face. This wasn't the last time that was filled with profound guilt. This was him making Asuka happy, fulfilling her wishes instead of his own.  
再次深吸一口气，真嗣闭上眼睛，脸上渐渐浮现出一抹微笑。这并非最后一次充满深重罪恶感。这是他在让明日香开心，实现她的愿望而非自己的。

"I love you, too. Asuka." He smiled and leaned closer to her face, bringing their lips together.  
“我也爱你，明日香。”他微笑着，将脸贴近她的，双唇相触。

The morning rising sun had just peeked through the broken clouds as Asuka slowly woke up from the dreams. She was used to having morning moods – however, today she had felt more relaxed than ever before.  
清晨的朝阳刚刚透过破碎的云层，Asuka 缓缓从梦中醒来。她习惯了早晨的情绪波动——然而，今天她感到前所未有的放松。

Yawning, she tried to rise from bed, but was blocked by something. Smiling as she lowered her head to see Shinji had a relatively firm lock on her, his bare skin touching hers in a few spots. Asuka had to smile to herself; last night was wonderful, well beyond her expectations.  
她打着哈欠，试图从床上起身，却被什么东西挡住了。低头一看，Shinji 紧紧地抱着她，裸露的皮肤在几个地方与她相触。Asuka 不禁微笑；昨晚真是美妙，远远超出了她的预期。

Though it didn't help reduce the soreness that radiated from her nether regions, at all.  
虽然这并没有减轻她下体传来的酸痛感，一点也没有。

Asuka had thought the masturbation she had been doing would stretch her tunnel wide enough to make her first time not hurt as much, but now it seemed a mistake on her side.  
明日香曾以为自己之前的自慰行为能将通道撑得足够宽，让她的初次不那么痛苦，但现在看来这是她犯的一个错误。

_'Who thought Shinji would be so good at this?'_ Though she still had doubts, Asuka quickly shook them off. He was completely hers right now, and if he dared to break that promise, he shall endure her brutal wrath.  
“谁会想到真嗣在这方面这么厉害？”尽管心中仍有疑虑，明日香迅速将它们抛诸脑后。此刻他完全属于她，如果他胆敢违背那个承诺，必将承受她残酷的怒火。

Yawning again, Asuka looked down at her lover, making a somewhat shameful yet proud smirk as she noticed the bite marks and nail scratches on Shinji's back and shoulders. It was marked as Asuka Langley Soryu's exclusive territory that no one else shall invade.  
再次打了个哈欠，明日香低头看着她的爱人，注意到真嗣背上和肩上的咬痕与抓痕，她露出了既羞愧又自豪的微笑。这是明日香·兰格雷·索尤专属的领地，任何人不得侵犯。

"Well…you sure look happy," suddenly a quiet voice came to her.  
“嗯……你看起来确实很开心，”突然，一个轻柔的声音传入她的耳中。

"Hmm, as if you have to ask," Asuka countered, her mind still too hazy to recognize the owner of the voice, though she had initially marked it as Shinji's since none other people would be there. "How about a second round? I'm still capable."  
“哼，好像你还需要问似的，”明日香反驳道，她的思绪仍因迷糊而未能辨认出声音的主人，尽管她最初就将其标记为真嗣，因为那里不会有其他人。“再来一轮怎么样？我还能行。”

"I'm not a lesbian, you know." The voice answered. "It's not something I should be taking care of."  
“你知道我不是同性恋。”那个声音回答。“这不是我该负责的事。”

Asuka's right eye shot open as the meanings of the words reached her conscious brain. She jumped up from the bed, not caring about her entangled state with Shinji – who was woken up by the disruptive movement – and reached for the light switch.  
明日香的右眼猛地睁开，当话语的含义触及她清醒的大脑时。她从床上跳了起来，不顾与真嗣纠缠的状态——他被这突如其来的动作惊醒——伸手去开灯。

Just to reveal a uniform-wearing Major Katsuragi standing silently at the door with an unreadable expression on her face. "Before you ask, I'm here just to wake you guys up for school. It's already 7 am in the morning."  
只见身着制服的葛城美里少校静静地站在门口，脸上表情难以捉摸。“别问了，我来只是叫你们起床去上学。已经早上 7 点了。”

"Errrrrrrr…" Asuka felt like cat caught her tongue, unable to articulate any coherent words.  
“呃呃呃呃呃……”明日香感觉像被猫咬住了舌头，说不出一句连贯的话。

"I feel I don't need to ask what happened." She gestured at their nude forms and the used condom.  
“我觉得没必要问发生了什么。”她指了指他们赤裸的身体和用过的避孕套。

At the moment, Shinji got up from the bed as well. "Ah, Good morning, M-Misato-san," he greeted as he hastily snatched the sheet and covered himself.  
此刻，真嗣也从床上坐了起来。“啊，早上好，美里小姐，”他匆忙抓起床单遮住自己，问候道。

"Was last night your first time?" Misato asked.  
"昨晚是你的初次吗？" 美里问道。

Asuka sighed. "Yes it was. No dancing around, I guess. We, me and Shinji, had sex last night." She shrugged. "And we are not…stopping, I suppose."  
明日香叹了口气。“是的，没错。看来没必要绕弯子了。我和真嗣，昨晚发生了关系。”她耸耸肩。“而且我们似乎不打算……停下来。”

Misato's stern expression suddenly turned sorrowful. "I'm not asking you to stop, or anything." Her voice became sentimental as she continued; Asuka's eyebrow raised in surprise. "I know you're still too young for this…I would've told you to stop, or perhaps even force you guys to live apart if this happened a few months ago. But now?" Asuka could hear a near-sob escaped from Misato's throat. "You almost died. Both of you. I…I just can't. You could die in the next hour for all we know. You deserve each other, deserve some happiness."  
美里严肃的表情突然变得悲伤。“我并不是要求你们停止，或者别的什么。”她的声音变得感伤，继续说道；明日香惊讶地挑起眉毛。“我知道你们还太年轻……如果这事发生在几个月前，我可能会让你们停止，甚至强行让你们分开住。但现在呢？”明日香能听到美里喉咙里几乎要哭出来的声音。“你们差点就死了。你们俩都是。我……我做不到。我们甚至不知道你们下一小时会不会死。你们值得拥有彼此，值得一些幸福。”

Asuka turned her head to Shinji and winked at him, silently saying 'I told you so' to him.  
明日香转头对真嗣眨了眨眼，无声地向他传达着“我早就告诉过你了”的信息。

"Though I'm glad you remembered protection." Misato continued, a cocky grin slowly showed up on her face, her voice returning the tease-Misato kind. "Even though we are short of pilots right now, we don't want you to make little pilots…just yet."  
“虽然我很高兴你记得防护措施。”美里继续说道，脸上慢慢露出了得意的笑容，声音恢复了那种爱开玩笑的美里风格。“尽管我们现在缺少驾驶员，但我们还不想让你这么快就制造小驾驶员……”

"I told you we are responsible." Asuka huffed with pink cheeks.  
“我告诉过你我们有责任心。”明日香红着脸哼了一声。

"But now you have to go to school." Misato's voice dropped. "Change your clothes! HURRY UP!" She shouted before shutting the door close.  
"但现在你得去上学了。" 美里声音低沉下来，"换好衣服！快点！" 她喊完便砰地关上了门。

"Right. Damn." The soft THUD sound of the door shutting off like a starting pistol, Shinji and Asuka shot up from their spots and threw their school uniforms onto their bodies. Maybe it wasn't a bad day at all.  
"没错。该死。" 门轻轻关上，发出类似发令枪的闷响，真嗣和明日香立刻从座位上弹起，迅速将校服套在身上。或许今天根本就不算糟糕。

The school day started dull as usual, though it quickly turned into a hurricane of gossips as Asuka strode into the school gate with her head held high in pride, her hands holding Shinji's. Their couple status was no stranger to people in school, which implied it must've been Asuka's new…accessory that ignited the powder keg.  
学校的日子一如既往地沉闷开始，但随着明日香昂首挺胸、手牵着真嗣走进校门，校园里迅速掀起了一阵八卦的风暴。他们这对情侣在学校里早已不是什么新鲜事，这意味着必定是明日香的新……配饰点燃了这场八卦的导火索。

The redhead had been afraid of people making fun of her eyepatch, but soon got over with it, remembering what Shinji had told her before when she was in a wheelchair. She should treat it as a symbol of her status as an elite warrior, an insignia of her personal victory against the Angel that tried to take over her, but not a drawback of her appearance.  
红发女孩曾担心人们会嘲笑她的眼罩，但很快便释怀了，她记起坐在轮椅上时真嗣对她说过的话。她应该将其视为精英战士身份的象征，是她个人对抗试图侵占她的天使的胜利徽章，而非外貌上的缺陷。

Even if people would look at her funny, as long as Shinji looked at her with love and affection, the rest could go to hell for all she cared.  
即使人们会用奇怪的眼神看她，只要真嗣用爱和关怀的眼神看她，其他的一切对她来说都无所谓。

"Asuka! You finally came back!" Hikari's cheerful voice came to her as soon as she stepped into the peripheral vision of the class representative. Completely ignoring her duty of suppressing the exploding chattering that rippled through the classroom, the brunette ran to Asuka's side and smiled. "What happened to your eye?" She probed, her smile fading a bit.  
“明日香！你终于回来了！”她一踏入班长的视野，光子的欢快声音就传了过来。完全不顾压制教室里此起彼伏的嘈杂声的职责，这位棕发女孩跑到明日香身边，微笑着问道：“你的眼睛怎么了？”她的笑容稍稍淡了一些。

"It defeated an Angel and saved the world. It left a mark." Asuka smirked proudly.  
“它击败了一个使徒，拯救了世界。留下了这个印记。”明日香得意地笑了笑。

Even though Hikari felt strange how some gigantic monsters could leave a mark so precise, she didn't question it. Though her eyes settled on another thing that was new to her. "Oh, where did you get this necklace? It looks good on you!"  
尽管光觉得有些巨大的怪兽能留下如此精确的痕迹很奇怪，但她没有深究。不过她的目光落在了另一件新鲜事物上。“哦，这吊坠你从哪儿弄来的？戴在你身上真好看！”

Asuka tried not to let her face drop, and it only worked partially. "Yeah, I expected as much. It's NERV's special accessory." Knowing how ugly the red-black mix would look on her, she had asked Dr. Akagi to make a purple cover that camouflaged the DSS Choker as an actual necklace, just like the one she wore when she arrived in Japan.  
明日香尽量不让自己的表情垮下来，但这只成功了一半。“是啊，我早该料到的。这是 NERV 的特殊饰品。”她知道红黑相间的颜色戴在她身上会很难看，所以她请赤木博士做了一个紫色的罩子，把 DSS 项圈伪装成真正的项链，就像她刚到日本时戴的那条一样。

"Damn, not gonna lie, pirate Soryu looks kinda sick," Toji's remark brought a smile to Shinji's face.  
“该死，说实话，海盗装的惣流看起来真酷，”冬二的话让真嗣露出了微笑。

"Alright everyone! Go back to your seats!" Hikari finally remembered her job description as the class rep, shouting at her maximum volume as the bell rang.  
“好了，大家！回到座位上去！”随着铃声响起，光终于记起了她作为班长的职责，用最大的音量喊道。

"Rise! Bow! Sit!" Hikari announced as Sensei came in. "Eh, before we begin class today, um," Nebukawa sensei began, "We have a new transfer student joining us today…please introduce yourself to class."  
“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”光宣布道，当老师进来时。“呃，在我们开始今天的课程之前，嗯，”Nebukawa 老师开始说，“我们今天有一位新转学生加入我们……请向全班同学自我介绍一下。”

Shinji blinked. He had kinda expected something like this would happen, but he hadn't prepared for it yet. Asuka had been demanding so much of his attention lately.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他有点预料到会发生这样的事，但他还没准备好。最近明日香一直占据了他太多的注意力。

Fortunately, he had experience.  
幸运的是，他有经验。

Light footsteps took the newcomer to the chalkboard, his nimble hands quickly drew a few elegant kanji on the board. He turned to face the class with a gentle smile.  
轻盈的脚步引领着新来者走向黑板，他灵巧的手迅速在板上勾勒出几个优雅的汉字。他转过身，面带温和的微笑面对全班。

Silver hair. Red eyes. Pale skin. It is him.  
银发。红眸。苍白的肌肤。就是他。

"Hello, everyone. My name is Kaworu Nagisa. I am happy to be here today." His red eyes scanned the classroom, pausing for a moment on Rei, and finally settling down on Shinji.  
“大家好，我叫渚薰。很高兴今天能来到这里。”他的红眸扫视着教室，在绫波身上停留片刻，最终定格在真嗣身上。

The grin on his face widened a bit, then he looked in another direction. Shinji saw clearly Kaworu's eyes twitched, his ever-presenting grin almost changed into confusion for a moment. But he quickly adjusted his composure and continued. "Very happy."  
他脸上的笑容微微扩大，随后转向别处。真嗣清楚地看到薰的眼角抽动了一下，他那始终挂着的微笑几乎转瞬即逝地变成了困惑。但他很快调整了情绪，继续说道：“非常高兴。”

The sound of chatter from the students mingling in front of the school could be heard all the way from up on the roof, where Shinji and Asuka sat, eating their lunches. The entire class seemed to be split on how they felt about the newly arrived student. One half, a half that particularly mainly consisted of girls, thought he was cute and intriguing, whereas the other half found him creepy and ominous, much akin to how most of their classmates felt about Rei.  
从屋顶上，真嗣和明日香坐在那里吃午餐，可以听到学校前学生们混杂的交谈声。整个班级似乎对新来的学生意见不一。其中一半，主要是女生，觉得他既可爱又神秘；而另一半则觉得他诡异且不祥，就像大多数同学对绫波的感觉一样。

"Shinji, do you know what's up with this new student?" Asuka asked before putting an octopus sausage into her mouth. The sausage was covered by some mustard, and Asuka had to hide her grin to stop herself from showing the content in her mouth.  
"真嗣，你知道这个新学生是怎么回事吗？" 明日香问道，随后将一根章鱼香肠塞进嘴里。香肠上涂了些芥末，明日香不得不掩住嘴角的笑意，以免露出嘴里的内容。

Stealing glances at Shinji had become a habit for her ever since her public announcement. However, today such behavior only introduced unexpected irritation – that she found Kaworu Nagisa, who sat on the other side of Shinji, was looking at her boyfriend with clear interest as well.  
自从她公开宣布后，偷瞄真嗣已成为她的习惯。然而，今天这种行为却带来了意想不到的烦躁——她发现坐在真嗣另一边的渚薰，正以明显的兴趣看着她的男朋友。

"Em, I hear he's the new pilot? The Fifth Child, I mean." Shinji replied, though no one had actually told him about it yet. They were going to have a sync test this afternoon, anyway. "What's wrong, Asuka?" He followed as he heard her grumble.  
"呃，我听说他是新来的驾驶员？我是说，第五适格者。" 真嗣回答道，尽管实际上还没人告诉他这件事。反正他们下午就要进行同步测试了。"怎么了，明日香？" 他听到她的咕哝声，便问道。

"He looks at you funny, haven't you noticed?" Asuka huffed. Shinji could swear he could see a dim blue light intensify through her eyepatch. "And his features…he looks a lot like wondergirl. Red eyes, pale skin. It's creepy."  
“他看你的眼神很奇怪，你没注意到吗？”明日香哼了一声。真嗣发誓他能看到她眼罩下微弱的蓝光在增强。“还有他的特征……他看起来很像那个奇迹女孩。红眼睛，苍白的皮肤。真让人毛骨悚然。”

"Oh?" Shinji smirked; his voice switched into a playful tone. "Are you jealous?"  
“哦？”真嗣微微一笑；他的声音转为了调皮的语调。“你吃醋了吗？”

"As if!" Asuka barked, though contrasted by her forceful chewing on the food.  
“才怪！”明日香厉声说道，尽管她用力咀嚼食物的样子与之形成鲜明对比。

"Maybe he's just-" He trailed off as both of them could see a human shadow approaching them from behind. Asuka tensed up, ready to enter combat stance. Shinji, on the other hand, simply smiled and turned his head back, as if knowing who the intruder was.  
“也许他只是——”他话音未落，两人都能看到一个人影从背后向他们靠近。明日香紧张起来，准备进入战斗姿态。而真嗣则只是微笑着转过头，仿佛知道来者是谁。

"Kaworu Nagisa, right?" Shinji's inquisitive voice came to her.  
“渚薰，对吧？”真嗣好奇的声音传到她耳中。

"Correct. I suppose you are the Third Child, Shinji Ikari?" Kaworu's friendly tone started making Asuka's skin crawl.  
“没错。我想你就是第三适格者，碇真嗣？”薰友好的语气开始让明日香感到不安。

"Yep. Nice to meet you, Nagisa-san." Asuka gritted her teeth.  
“嗯哼。很高兴见到你，渚君。”明日香咬紧牙关。

She could hear Kaworu chuckle. "No need. Just call me Kaworu. I'll call you Shinji in return."  
她能听到渚薰轻笑的声音。“不用客气。叫我渚薰就好，我也会称呼你为真嗣。”

"Ahem!" Asuka shot up from her spot, snapping both heads in her direction. "Shinji, let's leave this place, alright? We have some private business to attend to."  
"咳咳！" 明日香从她的位置上猛地站起，将两人的目光都吸引过来。"真嗣，我们离开这里吧，好吗？我们有些私事要处理。"

Kaworu narrowed his eyes at her. "Excuse me, lady… isn't that should be his decision?"  
渚薰眯起眼睛看着她。“不好意思，女士……这难道不该由他自己决定吗？”

"Well, listen up." Asuka shot him a venomous glare. "I'm his girlfriend. I'm afraid I have a better claim on him than you do."  
“好吧，听好了。”明日香朝他投去一个恶狠狠的眼神。“我是他的女朋友。恐怕我对他的权利比你更大。”

If it wasn't sanity telling her otherwise, Asuka would swear a hint of sadness crossed Kaworu's face. "I see." His tone dropped. "I'll leave it to you, then."  
如果不是理智在提醒她，明日香几乎要发誓渚薰的脸上闪过一丝悲伤。“我明白了。”他的语气低沉下来。“那就交给你了。”

Asuka smirked in triumph as she watched Kaworu leave the rooftop with his light steps, not noticing the amused expression on her boyfriend's face.  
明日香得意地笑了，看着渚薰轻快地离开屋顶，没有注意到她男朋友脸上那饶有兴味的表情。

From atop a cliff overlooking one of the more desolate areas of Tokyo-3, Misato stood next to her car while she looked through her high-powered binoculars, zooming in on the enigma of a boy that was Kaworu Nagisa. On her own accord, she had been trailing him from a distance over the course of the few days since he had arrived, after seeing his suspicion-raising file that basically told her nothing.  
站在俯瞰东京-3 较为荒凉地区的一处悬崖上，美里站在她的车旁，透过高倍望远镜凝视着那个谜一般的男孩——渚薰。自从他到来后的几天里，她出于自己的意愿一直在远处跟踪他，这一切都源于那份几乎什么都没告诉她的可疑档案。

Ritsuko had been avoiding the topic of the Fifth Child for unspoken reasons, only showed her his files. Though it was enough of a motive for her to track down the new boy. From behind him, Misato couldn't make out the movement of his lips accurately, but she was sure he was talking to someone.  
律子一直避而不谈第五适格者的话题，只是给她看了他的档案。尽管这足以成为她追踪这个新男孩的动机。从他背后看去，美里无法准确分辨出他嘴唇的动作，但她确信他在和某人说话。

Down in the middle of the devastated street, Kaworu looked up as twelve black monoliths surrounded him. Though he was in an open area, he knew that only he could see and hear them.  
在毁坏的街道中央，碇真嗣抬头望去，十二座黑色巨碑环绕着他。尽管身处开阔地带，他知道只有自己能看见和听见它们。

"Are you alone?" The one floating directly before him spoke. SEELE 01, Chairman Keel Lorenz.  
“你独自一人吗？”悬浮在他正前方的那个声音问道。Seele 01，主席基尔·洛伦兹。

"Does it matter?" He shrugged, scanning up and down the desolate area around them.  
“这重要吗？”他耸耸肩，环视四周荒凉的景象。

"Watch your tone, boy." SEELE 06 snapped.  
"注意你的语气，小子。" SEELE 06 厉声喝道。

"Is there anything noteworthy of the Second and the Third Child?" SEELE 01 spoke up. "I hope you've collected some information as I told you so."  
"第二适格者和第三适格者有什么值得注意的地方吗？" SEELE 01 开口问道。"我希望你已经按照我说的收集了一些信息。"

"The Second and Third Children are in a…stable relationship," Kaworu smiled a sad smile. "None of them seem like the person I was told to expect."  
"第二适格者和第三适格者正处于一种……稳定的关系，" 渚薰带着一丝哀伤的微笑说道。"他们似乎都不是我所被告知要面对的那种人。"

"Hm." SEELE 01 pondered for a moment. Now he knew why Gendo was overly protective of the Second Child. He had never thought such a guy would care about his son so much. "Gendo Ikari's protectiveness of the Second and the Third Child is abnormal."  
“嗯。”SEELE 01 沉思片刻。现在他明白了为什么源堂对二号适格者过度保护。他从未想过这样一个男人会如此关心自己的儿子。“源堂对二号和三号适格者的保护欲异常。”

"It seems like the information we got from Fuyutsuki is correct." SEELE 07 intoned. "Now that NERV is still operating under full capacity, with our subpar MP EVAs we stand little chance."  
“看来我们从冬月那里得到的信息是正确的。”SEELE 07 低沉地说道，“既然 NERV 仍在满负荷运转，以我们那些劣质的 MP EVA，我们几乎没有胜算。”

"Regardless," SEELE 01 spoke up again. He had been preparing for everything. "It only makes things easier. You know what to do. You have the plans we've developed for you."  
“无论如何，” SEELE 01 再次开口。他一直在为一切做准备。“这只会让事情变得更容易。你知道该怎么做。你有我们为你制定的计划。”

"As you wish." Kaworu bowed a little. With that, the monoliths vanished, and the fair-skinned boy was left to stand amongst the wreckage and debris-filled street alone. Or at least, so a certain someone would like for him to think.  
“如你所愿。” 渚薰微微鞠了一躬。话音刚落，那些巨石碑便消失了，留下那位皮肤白皙的少年独自站在满是残骸和碎片的街道上。至少，某个特定的人希望他这么认为。

Letting out a small sigh, Kaworu turned around and gave a slight nod to Misato, who was still watching him from off in the distance. The plan SEELE gave him had laid out how to 'approach' the Third Child and how to get the Second Child 'by their side,' or to eliminate her 'if nothing else works.'  
渚薰轻轻叹了口气，转身向远处仍在注视他的美里微微点头。SEELE 给他的计划详细说明了如何‘接近’第三适格者，以及如何让第二适格者‘站在他们一边’，或者如果其他方法都不奏效，就‘除掉她’。

Of course, he couldn't just expose himself. Not before the sixteenth Angel appeared.  
当然，他不能就这样暴露自己。至少得等到第十六使徒出现之前。

The Major let out a gasp as she dropped her binoculars. She knew for a fact that it was impossible for anyone to notice her from that distance with the naked eye.  
少校惊呼一声，手中的望远镜滑落。她确信，任何人都不可能仅凭肉眼从那么远的距离注意到她。

"What the hell? Who is he?" Misato murmured, taking a step back towards her car. Whoever he was, Misato knew his purpose couldn't be good.  
“搞什么鬼？他是谁？”美里喃喃自语，向后退向她的车。无论他是谁，美里知道他的目的绝非善事。

AN: In the last chapter during the flashback beach scene, I wrote "black sphere" hanging on the sky. It's supposed to be the blackmoon, however after rewatching EoE and discussion with skyf0x I found out that there wasn't one in EoE, I confused it with the blackmoon in the RoE beach scene. So I fixed it.  
AN: 在上章的闪回海滩场景中，我写到了悬挂在天上的“黑色球体”。原本指的是黑月，但在重看《EoE》并与 skyf0x 讨论后发现，《EoE》中并没有黑月，我混淆了《RoE》海滩场景中的黑月。因此我进行了修正。

**Chapter 36: Attempt 第三十六章：尝试**

Rei Ayanami stood silently atop the catwalk before the blue EVA Unit 00, her plugsuit wrapping tightly around her slender body. The more she thought about the recent events, the more she found herself unable to understand.  
绫波零静静地站在蓝色 EVA 初号机前的检修通道上，紧身驾驶服紧紧包裹着她纤瘦的身躯。她越是思考最近发生的事情，越是发现自己无法理解。

Turning her head as she felt another presence coming closer to her, Rei fixed her crimson eyes on the intruder of her small peaceful moment before her sync test.  
感觉到另一个身影逐渐靠近，绫波零转过头，用她那深红色的眼睛凝视着这个闯入她短暂宁静时刻的不速之客，就在她的同步测试之前。

"Rei Ayanami, correct?" Kaworu started, keeping his smirk on the face. "The First Child, and the pilot of Evangelion Unit 00."  
"绫波零，对吧？" 渚薰开口道，脸上依旧挂着微笑。"第一适格者，也是 EVA 零号机的驾驶员。"

"Yes," Rei replied concisely.  
"是的，" 绫波简洁地回答。

"You're the same as me..." Kaworu narrowed his eyes at her, sensing the subtle shift of her AT-Field. "So, both of us ended up in the same form as Lilim while we inhabit this planet."  
"你和我一样..." 渚薰眯起眼睛注视着她，察觉到她 AT 力场的微妙变化。"所以，我们俩都以莉莉姆的形态存在于这个星球上。"

"Who are you?" “你是谁？”

"I am the Fifth Child, Kaworu Nagisa." Kaworu bowed slightly.  
"我是第五适格者，渚薰。" 渚薰微微鞠躬。

"But I do not see any similarities between us." Rei's ghostly voice came to him, eliciting a chuckle from the silver-haired boy.  
“但我看不出我们之间有什么相似之处。”丽那幽灵般的声音传到他耳中，引得银发少年轻笑出声。

"I see that you're still unaware of your true nature." His voice gained an impression of smugness in it. "While you chose the vessel that's in the form of Lilim, your soul continues to be that of Lilith's."  
“看来你仍未意识到自己的真实本质。”他的声音中带上了一丝自得。“尽管你选择了以莉莉姆形态的容器，你的灵魂依旧是莉莉丝的。”

"I do not understand."  
“我不明白。”

Kaworu waved his hand dismissively. "All that was born from Lilith is bond to return to Lilith." Smirking, he walked away from the catwalk and headed to his own EVA Unit 03. "It is your destiny to do so."  
渚薰不以为意地挥了挥手。“所有由莉莉丝诞生的存在，注定要回归莉莉丝。”他带着一丝讥讽的微笑，从天桥上走开，朝着自己的 EVA 初号机 03 走去。“这是你的宿命。”

Rei Ayanami kept her intensifying gaze at him until he disappeared around the corner. "I don't like him," she mumbled to herself before climbing into her own entry plug.  
绫波零一直用她愈发强烈的目光注视着他，直到他消失在转角处。“我不喜欢他。”她喃喃自语，随后爬进了自己的插入栓。

"Major Katsuragi," Maya called in an odd voice, looking away from her terminal. "You might want to take a look at this."  
"葛城少校，"摩耶用一种奇怪的语气喊道，目光从终端上移开。"你可能需要看看这个。"

Misato moved from the observation window of the testing chamber and began making her way towards Maya. Her nervousness grew for every step she took – it was the Fifth Child's first sync test with the newly arrived Unit 03, as well as Asuka's first one after Unit 02 was cleansed entirely, and she was sure Maya wouldn't call her if everything was normal.  
美里从测试室的观察窗前移开，开始向真希波走去。每走一步，她的紧张感就增加一分——这是第五适格者与新抵达的三号机首次同步测试，也是明日香在二号机完全净化后的首次测试，她确信真希波不会在一切正常的情况下叫她过来。

"What is it, Maya?" She asked, leaning over the brunette's chair.  
“怎么了，玛雅？”她问道，俯身靠近那位棕发女子的椅子。

"Shinji's sync rate is high as usual, and Asuka's taking a mild dive from her last sync test before the thirteenth Angel. Rei is doing just fine, around the mid-fifties, and the Fifth Child's score is just sitting at eighty percent."  
"真嗣的同步率一如既往地高，而明日香在第十三使徒前的最后一次同步测试中略有下降。绫波表现正常，大约在五十几左右，而第五适格者的分数则稳定在百分之八十。"

Misato squinted her eyes as she looked at the live feed from the inside of the test plugs. Kaworu Nagisa, unlike all other pilots who had their eyes closed with peaceful expressions, also wore a rather noticeable smirk on his face, as if he wasn't even trying his best to concentrate.  
美里眯起眼睛看着测试插头内部的实时画面。与其他所有闭着眼睛、表情平和的驾驶员不同，渚薰的脸上带着相当明显的微笑，仿佛他并没有全力以赴地集中注意力。

"So what's the big deal?" Misato remarked. As far as she was concerned, maintaining a steady sync rate wasn't exactly outlandish to her.  
"那又有什么大不了的呢？" 美里说道。在她看来，保持稳定的同步率并不算什么特别的事情。

"The big deal is we haven't even configured the core for him yet," Maya replied.  
“关键是我们还没为他配置核心呢，”玛雅回答道。

The Major of NERV gave her a perplexed look that screamed the words 'please elaborate.'  
NERV 的总指挥给了她一个困惑的眼神，仿佛在大声说‘请详细说明’。

"Major, you do know that the pilots are able to sync with their EVAs because the respective cores are specifically configured for them, right?" Maya probed.  
“少校，您应该知道驾驶员能够与他们的 EVA 同步，是因为各自的核是专门为他们配置的，对吧？”玛雅问道。

"Yeah." Misato nodded, feeling a bit annoyed that her college friend, Dr. Akagi, had never taken so much time explaining anything to her in detail, except the time when she was interrogating her about Asuka's condition.  
“嗯。”美里点头道，心中有些不悦，她的大学好友赤城博士从未如此详细地向她解释过任何事情，除了那次她盘问她关于明日香状况的时候。

Typically, she would say 'you don't need to know' at worst or put everything in laymen's terms at best – while Maya, on the other hand, actually spent time explaining technical details. "When we did the cross-sync test between the pilots..." Maya made a few keystrokes, pulling up a chart to the screen. "Shinji, Asuka, and Rei were able to pass the absolute borderline, yes. But their sync rates in unfamiliar EVAs were atrocious, much lower than that in their own EVAs. But the Fifth Child...he's born different."  
通常情况下，她会说‘你不需要知道’，或者最多用通俗易懂的话解释一切——而玛雅则不同，她实际上花时间解释技术细节。“当我们对驾驶员进行交叉同步测试时……”玛雅敲了几下键盘，调出一张图表显示在屏幕上。“真嗣、明日香和绫波能够通过绝对界限，是的。但他们在不熟悉的 EVA 中的同步率非常糟糕，远低于他们自己的 EVA。但第五个孩子……他天生与众不同。”

"Could it be a…"  
"这会不会是……"

"The MAGI doesn't glitch. The equipment we use is in perfect condition as well." Maya cut her off, though she quickly realized her rudeness. "Sorry about that, Major."  
"MAGI 系统没有出现故障。我们使用的设备也处于完美状态。" 玛雅打断了她，但很快意识到自己的无礼。"抱歉，少校。"

"Nah, you're fine." Misato waved her hand. "So…what could this possibly imply?"  
"没事，你做得对。" 美里挥了挥手。"那么……这可能意味着什么呢？"

"If I didn't know any better, I'd say that he isn't human."  
“如果我不了解情况，我会说他不是人类。”

Misato felt her heart sink into her stomach as the answer reached her - it was the most dreaded answer she could've got. The recollections of the boy's strangeness didn't help things, at all.  
当这个答案传到她耳中时，美里感到心沉到了胃里——这是她最不愿听到的答案。那个男孩的种种怪异行为更是让事情雪上加霜。

The sound of machines beeping and buzzing flowed through Shinji's ears while he sat on a bench, waiting for Asuka to come back from her physical examination in NERV's medical wing. Ever since the thirteenth Angel burrowed itself inside of her left eye, the Second Child had to go through regular exams and checkups to ensure that the possession's state wasn't faltering any farther than it already had.  
真嗣坐在长椅上，耳边传来机器的哔哔声和嗡嗡声，等待着明日香从 NERV 医疗翼的体检中回来。自从第十三使徒钻入她的左眼后，这位二号适格者不得不接受定期检查，以确保附身状态没有进一步恶化。

Fortunately, it seemed that nothing – such as emissions - really changed since then. Her appointments were becoming much less frequent and overall, she seemed to be coming back from them less and less pissed off about them than she had in the past.  
幸运的是，自那以后，似乎没有什么——比如排放——真正改变过。她的预约变得越来越少，总体来看，她从这些预约中回来的情绪也比过去少了很多愤怒。

"Shinji-kun." A voice called out to him, catching his attention. Shinji looked up as a familiar silver-haired pilot approached him, a smirk on his face.  
“真嗣君。”一个声音叫住了他，吸引了他的注意。真嗣抬头一看，一个熟悉的银发驾驶员正向他走来，脸上带着一丝戏谑的微笑。

Kaworu Nagisa. Shinji let out a silent sigh. He knew sooner or later, he would have to confront the Angel-human mixture by himself. At first, Shinji wanted to treat him as his friend after the ordeal in the first cycle, and it had partially worked – though it didn't help when he had to kill him in the end.  
渚薰。真嗣无声地叹了口气。他知道迟早，他必须独自面对这个天使与人类的混合体。起初，真嗣想在第一轮的磨难后把他当作朋友，这在某种程度上奏效了——尽管最后他不得不杀了他，这并没有什么帮助。

There was simply no way he could avoid Third Impact and let the world be safe with an Angel walking around.  
他根本无法避免第三次冲击，只要还有使徒在四处游荡，世界就不可能安全。

He thought Kaworu loved him for who he was, that was one reason he wanted to treat him as a friend. Until that time…  
他曾以为渚薰爱他是因为他本身，这也是他想把他当作朋友的原因之一。直到那一刻…

_"You're really arrogant and selfish…you know that this is no redemption for the people here, don't you?"  
“你真是傲慢又自私……你知道这并不能为这里的人赎罪，对吧？”_

_"So…this is the answer you got, Ikari Shinji-kun? Your soul…is both twisted, and evil…enough for me to despise you."  
“所以……这就是你得出的答案吗，碇真嗣君？你的灵魂……既扭曲又邪恶……足以让我鄙视你。”_

_"…So pure…" “…如此纯净…”_

It was then he also realized that, every cycle he went on was a new world with everything reset, including Kaworu's status.  
那时他也意识到，每一次循环都是一个全新的世界，一切都重置了，包括渚薰的状态。

After all, he was just another Angel that had to be defeated.  
毕竟，他不过是又一个必须被打败的天使。

Shinji shook the thoughts off. "Oh, hey Kaworu." He returned with a smile. "What're you doing here?" Knowing how heavily surveilled NERV Medical Ring was, Shinji knew he had to take a more subtle approach. He only had one ultimate goal in mind – the last Angel was to be defeated, so he might need Asuka and Rei to keep an eye on him during the battles.  
真嗣甩开这些念头。“哦，嘿，渚薰。”他笑着回应。“你在这里做什么？”深知 NERV 医疗环的严密监控，真嗣明白他必须采取更隐晦的方式。他心中只有一个终极目标——最后的使徒必须被击败，因此他可能需要明日香和绫波在战斗中监视他。

Kaworu's sharp crimson eyes softened a little, along with the rest of his features. "I saw you are here, since I'm new here I want to stop by and say hi." He answered before looking towards the empty seat next to the pilot of Unit 01. "Mind if I take a seat?"  
渚薰锐利的深红色眼眸柔和了几分，连带他的其他表情也缓和下来。“我看到你在这里，因为我是新来的，所以想过来打个招呼。”他回答后，目光转向了初号机驾驶员旁边的空座位。“介意我坐这里吗？”

"Of course not," Shinji said, scooting over to the side to allow some more room for him to sit. "Go ahead." Being confrontational wouldn't help things, Shinji needed to - no matter how much he hated the word - manipulate the last Angel to make sure the last fight would go easier for both of them.  
“当然不是，”真嗣说着，挪到一旁给他腾出更多空间坐下。“请便。”对抗无济于事，真嗣需要——无论多么讨厌这个词——操纵最后一个使徒，确保最后一战对他们双方都更轻松。

Slowly, the silver-haired pilot turned around and lowered himself onto the cushioned bench, leaning his back against the wall. "So how are you, Shinji?" He asked, his tone a little more mellow than normal.  
慢慢地，银发驾驶员转过身，坐到软垫长椅上，背靠墙壁。“那么，你怎么样，真嗣？”他问道，语气比平时稍微柔和些。

"I'm good, thanks for asking," Shinji replied.  
“我很好，谢谢关心，”真嗣回答道。

A faint grin emerged on Kaworu's features, just barely exposing some of the white in his teeth. "I wonder what is your plan after the Angel wars?"  
加沃鲁的脸上浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑，仅微微露出了些许牙齿的白色。“我想知道，天使战争之后你有什么计划？”

Shinji took a deep breath, both preventing himself from letting out a sarcastic laugh and preparing his answer. "If we do have a future after the Angel Wars...I wish I could just live my life somewhere with Asuka." It was indeed the wildest, yet one simple wish he had ever since the cycles started.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，既是为了阻止自己发出讽刺的笑声，也是为了准备他的回答。“如果天使战争之后我们真的还有未来...我希望我能和明日香一起在某处过上平凡的生活。”这确实是他自循环开始以来最狂野却又最简单的愿望。

"I see." Kaworu chuckled; Shinji could swear he caught a hint of surprise from it. "You have my regards for it. Though do you not have other dreams? Like conquering and manipulating the world from behind the curtain, for instance?"  
“我明白了。”渚薰轻笑出声；真嗣发誓他从中捕捉到了一丝惊讶。“你值得我敬佩。不过，难道你没有其他梦想吗？比如在幕后征服和操控世界之类的？”

Shinji let out a sad short laugh. Granted, there were many times he had the opportunity to do it at his position. "No, not really. I mean, what's the point of conquering the world without someone who cares about you at your side? Besides, Asuka is already my whole world, anyway." He replied, happy that all of his statements were as truthful as they could get.  
真嗣发出了一声悲伤的短笑。确实，他有很多次机会可以这样做。“不，并不是。我是说，如果没有一个关心你的人在你身边，征服世界又有什么意义呢？再说，明日香已经是我的整个世界了，无论如何。”他回答道，很高兴他的所有陈述都尽可能地真实。

"You truly feel that way, don't you?" Kaworu's voice was hushed and serious, a strong contrast to how it was before.  
“你真的这么认为，对吧？”渚薰的声音低沉而严肃，与之前截然不同。

"Of course." Shinji nodded.  
“当然。”真嗣点头道。

"That's...truly beautiful, Shinji." Taking in a deep breath, Kaworu turned away from Shinji and gazed blankly ahead. Never before had he met someone with so much selflessness.  
“那真是……非常美丽，真嗣。” 深吸一口气，渚薰转过身去，目光空洞地望向前方。他从未遇见过如此无私的人。

The people he had encountered before, namely SEELE members and some technicians at NERV German Branch, would manipulate others without so much as second thoughts, and that's why he in turn manipulated them.  
他之前遇到的人，即 SEELE 成员和 NERV 德国分部的一些技术人员，会毫不犹豫地操纵他人，这就是为什么他反过来操纵他们。

His ultimate goal was to return to Adam; even though he didn't need to listen to SEELE and help them do what they wanted, the plans they developed for him would make it easier for him to achieve his own goal, anyway.  
他的最终目标是回到亚当；尽管他不需要听从 SEELE 的命令并帮助他们实现他们的愿望，但他们为他制定的计划无论如何都会让他更容易实现自己的目标。

"Shinji, could you please tell me why does the Second Child means so much to you?"  
“真嗣，你能告诉我为什么二号对你来说意义如此重大吗？”

"Because..." He let a moment of silence hang between them. Why did Asuka mean so much to him, to the extent that she became the only thing that mattered to him in the whole world? Was it because of the guilt of the crime he had committed against her? Or was it because after so long, he had already lost his mind, that she was the only one who could anchor him to reality?  
“因为……”他让片刻的沉默悬在他们之间。为什么明日香对他来说意义如此重大，以至于她成了他在整个世界上唯一在乎的人？是因为他对她犯下的罪行感到愧疚吗？还是因为经历了这么久，他已经失去了理智，而她是唯一能将他固定在现实的人？

"Because I love her," Shinji spoke, lowering his head and letting his bangs fall partly over his eyes. "She means everything to me. If I lost her, then I wouldn't have anything left really. I mean, what's the point of living your life if there is nobody who makes it worthwhile?"  
“因为我爱她，”真嗣说道，低下头让刘海部分遮住了眼睛。“她对我来说意味着一切。如果我失去了她，那么我真的就一无所有了。我是说，如果生活中没有人让你觉得它值得活下去，那活着还有什么意义呢？”

"You love her?" Kaworu rubbed his chin as he pondered. "What is this 'love'? How do you even describe it?"  
“你爱她？”渚薰摸着下巴沉思。“这个‘爱’是什么？你又是如何描述它的呢？”

"It's hard to explain in words." Shinji shrugged. "It's just that...when she gets hurt, or if she turns away from me...it hurts me so much that I can't stand it. And I want to make her happy."  
“很难用言语解释。”真嗣耸了耸肩。“只是……当她受伤，或是她转身背对我时……我心痛得无法忍受。而我想要让她快乐。”

"But do you think that she feels the same way about you?"  
“但你觉得她对你也有同样的感觉吗？”

"Of course I do!" Shinji didn't even find himself surprised that his answer came so quickly and with such passion.  
“当然有！”真嗣甚至没有发现自己回答得如此迅速且充满激情。

"Lil-I mean humans are such interesting creatures." Kaworu bit down on his upper lip and averted his eyes from Shinji, looking straight forward. "You truly have a pure and tender heart, Shinji." He smirked, standing up from the chair. Looking directly into Shinji's eyes, Kaworu leaned his face closer to Shinji's, his smile growing wider for each passing moment.  
“人类真是些有趣的生物。” 渚薰咬了咬上唇，避开真嗣的目光，直视前方。“你确实有一颗纯净温柔的心，真嗣。” 他微微一笑，从椅子上站起身来。直视着真嗣的眼睛，渚薰的脸渐渐靠近，笑容随着时间的推移愈发灿烂。

Before Shinji could draw back, though, Kaworu stopped dead in tracks as if sensing some kind of incoming danger. "Goodbye, Shinji." Kaworu stepped backward. Without so much as another word, the silver-haired boy turned around and swiftly made his way down the hall towards the elevator.  
然而，在真嗣来得及退缩之前，渚突然停下脚步，仿佛感应到了某种迫近的危险。“再见，真嗣。”渚向后退了一步。没有再多说一句话，银发少年转身迅速沿着走廊向电梯走去。

Shinji felt a cold chill over his shoulder as he turned around and saw Asuka standing firmly with her hands on her hips and a vicious scowl on her face while her ice blue eyes pierced like daggers as she glared past him, towards the pilot of Unit 03, who was making his exit in the elevator.  
真嗣感到一阵寒意掠过肩头，他转过身，看到明日香双手叉腰，面带凶狠的怒容，冰蓝色的眼睛如同利刃般穿透他的视线，直瞪着正走进电梯的 03 号机驾驶员。

"I'm going to have a few _warm_ words with him." The redhead hissed as she began storming down the hall.  
“我要跟他好好谈谈。”红发女子低声说着，开始怒气冲冲地沿着走廊走去。

"Asuka, wait!" Shinji tried to stop her, but found her quickly pushing him to the side.  
“明日香，等等！” 真嗣试图阻止她，却发现她迅速将他推到一边。

"Back off, Shinji." She growled, stomping down the hall. It was only then Shinji had realized that any attempt to stop her would be in vain. Asuka hastily made her way to the elevators as well, entering a different one other than Kaworu's.  
“滚开，真嗣。” 她咆哮着，大步走过走廊。直到这时，真嗣才意识到任何试图阻止她的尝试都是徒劳的。明日香匆忙走向电梯，进入了一个不同于渚薰所在的电梯。

Shinji tried to catch up to her and stop her, but the moment she saw him trying to catch up to her, Asuka pressed the button, causing the elevator door to close before Shinji could get inside.  
真嗣试图追上她并阻止她，但就在她看到他试图追上来的一瞬间，明日香按下了按钮，电梯门在真嗣进入之前关闭了。

"Asuka!" Shinji banged on the door, trying to get through to her. "Don't do this!"  
"明日香！" 真嗣用力敲打着门，试图让她听见。"别这样做！"

"You're just too innocent to see his bad intentions!" She raised her volume. "So let me deal with it!"  
"你太天真了，看不出他的坏心思！" 她提高了音量。"让我来处理吧！"

"But Asuka, you really shouldn't…" Before he could get his words out, he could hear the sound of the elevator beginning to move, leaving him behind while the Second Child continued on her pursuit of the Fifth. "Damn it!" Shinji growled as he continued banging his fist against the door.  
“但是明日香，你真的不应该……”他还没来得及说完，就听到电梯开始移动的声音，把他留在原地，而二号机驾驶员继续追赶着五号机。“该死！”真嗣一边咒骂，一边继续用拳头猛击门。

XXXXXX

The solid black face of Evangelion Unit 03 stared vacantly at Kaworu as he made his way across the catwalk. Each step he took echoed throughout the cages until he finally came to a stop before the EVA.  
福音战士三号机那漆黑的面孔空洞地凝视着卡洛，当他穿过天桥时。他每走一步，回声就在笼子里回荡，直到他终于在 EVA 前停下。

"What's up, rookie!" A shrill voice caught his attention, causing him to turn around to see Asuka storming her way across the catwalk, quickly closing the distance between them.  
"怎么了，菜鸟！"一个尖锐的声音吸引了他的注意，让他转身看到明日香正气势汹汹地穿过天桥，迅速拉近他们之间的距离。

"Oh." He smiled. "Hello, Second Chil-" Before he could finish his sentence, though, he felt the firm grasp of Asuka's hands around his collar as she jerked him closer to her.  
“哦。”他微笑着说，“你好，二号千——”然而，他话还没说完，就感觉到明日香双手紧紧抓住他的衣领，将他猛地拉近自己。

"I want you to leave him alone, get it?!" Her vicious snarl reverberated throughout the room, traveling all the way down the adjoining hallways. "Or I will break your goddamned jaw so you'll never be able to talk to him ever again!"  
“我要你离他远点，明白吗？！”她恶狠狠的咆哮在房间里回荡，甚至传到了相连的走廊尽头。“否则我会打碎你那该死的下巴，让你永远无法再和他说话！”

"I'm sorry, Pilot Soryu, but I don't understand the reason behind your anger." His tone remained easy and calm, wearing a smirk that Asuka wanted to instantly slap off his face.  
“抱歉，碇司令，我不明白你发怒的原因。”他的语气依旧轻松平静，嘴角挂着一丝让明日香恨不得立刻扇掉的讥笑。

With another firm jerk of his collar, she pulled Kaworu closer until his face was merely inches away from her own. "I don't ever want to see you around Stupid Shinji ever again. Got it!"  
她再次用力拽了一下他的衣领，将 Kaworu 拉近，直到他的脸离她仅几英寸之遥。“我再也不想看到你出现在笨蛋真嗣周围。明白了吗！”

"Again, isn't that his decision to make?" If anything, his nonchalant manner only further infuriated her.  
“再说，那不是他自己的决定吗？” 他的若无其事的态度反而更加激怒了她。

"Listen carefully you moron!" Asuka barked. "He's mine! Even if he has to choose, he will choose me, not you!"  
"听好了，你这个笨蛋！" 明日香厉声道，"他是我的！就算他得做选择，他也会选我，不会选你！"

He scratched his chin in wonderment, curious as to what had angered her so much. Though he knew that first impressions weren't much to go by, he had to admit that the SEELE Committee's description of her as an abrasive and unstable individual seemed to be spot on so far.  
他好奇地挠了挠下巴，想知道是什么让她如此生气。虽然他明白第一印象并不足以作为判断依据，但他不得不承认，SEELE 委员会形容她是个尖锐且不稳定的人，到目前为止似乎非常准确。

Kaworu narrowed his eyes as he saw a dim clue light piercing through the eyepatch covering Asuka's left eye. He tried to probe her AT-Field, but to no avail. Her light of soul was slightly different from other Lilim he had met before.  
渚薰眯起眼睛，他看到一道微弱的线索光透过明日香左眼上的眼罩。他试图探查她的 AT 力场，却徒劳无功。她的灵魂之光与其他他所遇过的李林略有不同。

"You are definitely not the Second Child I expected to meet, Pilot Soryu." Kaworu spoke up, a slight frown crossing his pale face.  
“你绝对不是我所预料的第二适格者，飞行员惣流。”渚薰开口说道，苍白的脸上掠过一丝皱眉。

"Oh?" A note of curiosity slipped into Asuka's voice. "Were you expecting to meet me?"  
"哦？" 明日香的声音中流露出一丝好奇。"你以为会遇到我吗？"

"Of course. You are famous in our business." Kaworu smirked. "You and the Thi-I mean Shinji had saved the world multiple times."  
"当然。你在我们这一行可是赫赫有名。" 渚薰微微一笑，"你和 Thi——我是说真嗣，已经多次拯救了世界。"

Asuka huffed, her expression leaving no doubt about how she felt about his remark. "Of course. We are elite EVA pilots. Killing Angels are what we do best."  
明日香哼了一声，她的表情清楚地表明了她对这句话的感受。"当然。我们是精英 EVA 驾驶员。消灭使徒是我们最擅长的。"

"I wonder though...what's so special about you? Why it's you who's the one he loves?"  
"不过我倒是好奇...你有什么特别的？为什么是他爱上的那个人？"

Asuka's eyes went wide, taken aback by the abruptness of the question. "It's none of your business!"  
明日香的眼眸瞪大，被这突如其来的问题吓了一跳。“这关你什么事！”

"Do you love him as much as he loves you?" Kaworu asked. "Do you even know how much he loves you?"  
“你爱他像他爱你一样深吗？”渚薰问道，“你甚至知道他有多爱你吗？”

"Of course I do! He'll never leave me, and I'll never leave him!" Asuka's reply came out without hesitation. "And you, stay the fuck away from our business!"  
“当然知道！他永远不会离开我，我也永远不会离开他！”明日香毫不犹豫地回答，“而你，离我们的私事远点！”

"Your business? Does piloting the EVA count?" Kaworu kept his hands in his pocket while he spoke. Before she could talk, though, he continued. "It doesn't really matter. I'm stuck with you, this or the other way."  
"你的事？驾驶 EVA 算不算？" 渚薰说话时双手插在口袋里。没等她开口，他又继续说道："其实无所谓。我注定要和你在一起，无论哪种方式。"

"You know what doesn't matter? The fact that you're a pilot here with us." Asuka scolded. She really didn't know why she was still here arguing with him. Maybe she should've left long ago after making sure her point was delivered. "I don't know why, or how that they chose the likes of you to pilot!"  
"你知道什么不重要吗？你作为飞行员和我们在一起的事实。" 明日香责备道。她真的不知道为什么还在这里和他争论。也许她早就该在确保自己的观点传达后离开。"我不知道为什么，也不知道他们是怎么选上你这样的人来驾驶的！"

"Say, Pilot Soryu, have you ever thought about how _you_ were chosen as a pilot?" Kaworu improvised, recalling the guidance SEELE had given him.  
"我说，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你有没有想过自己为何被选为驾驶员？" 渚薰即兴发挥，回想起 SEELE 给他的指导。"

"What the hell kind of question is that?! I'm chosen as a pilot because I'm talented, of course!" Replied Asuka truthfully. In fact, it was what she had been telling herself the moment she was elected. Though she had been starting to have doubts, especially after meeting the Fourth Child. "What the hell do you want?!" She switched to a defensive tone.  
“这算什么鬼问题？！我被选为驾驶员当然是因为我有天赋！”明日香如实回答。事实上，这是她被选中的那一刻起就一直对自己说的话。尽管她开始产生怀疑，尤其是在遇到第四适格者之后。“你到底想干什么？！”她切换到了防御性的语气。

"I came with an offer," Kaworu fixed his piercing gaze on Asuka's right eye, making the redhead shiver. "An opportunity for you to learn about the truth."  
"我带来了一个提议，" 渚薰将他锐利的目光锁定在明日香的右眼上，让这位红发少女不禁打了个寒颤。"一个让你了解真相的机会。"

"The truth? What the hell do you mean by 'truth'?!" Asuka narrowed her eye dangerously. "Are you telling me that I'm chosen for some…unpresentable reasons?"  
"真相？你说的'真相'到底是什么鬼？！" 明日香危险地眯起了眼睛。"你是说，我被选中有某些……见不得人的理由？"

"No no, don't get me wrong." Kaworu shook his head, still keeping his smirk. "Have you ever wondered what actually happened to your mother, Pilot Soryu?"  
"不不，别误会。" 渚薰摇了摇头，依旧保持着微笑。"你有没有想过，你的母亲究竟发生了什么，Soryu 驾驶员？"

Asuka's first instinct was to raise hell and apply direct and merciless physical violence – in fact, she would've already had if she was still the Asuka several months ago. Now though, after the talk with Shinji about their parents, she was more open about this particular topic – therefore, her logical part of brain successfully reduced movements that would likely cause a few bone fractures to a simple clenched fist and a death glare.  
明日香的第一反应是发飙并施以直接而毫不留情的身体暴力——事实上，如果是几个月前的她，可能已经动手了。但现在，在与真嗣谈论过他们的父母之后，她对这个问题更加开放了——因此，她理智的那部分大脑成功地将可能导致几处骨折的动作减少到了仅仅紧握拳头和一道死亡凝视。

"Speak. I promise to listen before I kill you."  
"说吧。我保证在杀你之前先听你说。"

"Like I said, I came here with an offer, a chance for you to meet your mother again," Kaworu said, his smirk widened by a minuscule amount. "As a trade-off, I need something from you as well."  
"就像我说的，我来这里是为了给你一个提议，一个让你再次见到你母亲的机会，"" 渚薰说道，他的微笑微微扩大了一些。""作为交换，我也需要从你那里得到一些东西。"

Asuka raised an eyebrow, then her face dropped lower – if that was still possible – as a disgusting realization struck her. "If this is some perverted-"  
明日香挑了挑眉，随即脸色更加阴沉——如果这还有可能的话——一股令人作呕的领悟击中了她。“如果这是什么变态的——”

Kaworu tilted his head. "What is 'perverted'?"  
渚薰歪了歪头。""'变态'是什么意思？""

A frown crossed her face. Was he seriously that innocent? It didn't matter, though. "Why should I trust you?" Asuka's voice turned freezingly cold.  
她的眉头紧锁。他真的那么天真吗？不过这并不重要。“我为什么要相信你？”明日香的声音变得冰冷刺骨。

"You don't need to trust me. What I need you to do is very simple."  
“你不需要信任我。我需要你做的事情非常简单。”

"That is?" “那是？”

"I can't tell you now. Maybe we can talk later after the next Angel attack." Kaworu replied with a shrug. He knew even people as oblivious as the Second Child shouldn't know about his need to go down to Central Dogma. "You have time to think about it. We have plenty of time."  
"我现在不能告诉你。或许下次使徒袭击后我们可以再谈。" 渚薰耸了耸肩回答。他知道即使是像二号机驾驶员这样迟钝的人，也不应该知道他需要前往中央教条区的需求。"你有时间考虑。我们还有很多时间。"

Asuka kept her right eye in contact with Kaworu's red ones in a silent glaring battle. She knew there was something wrong with the Fifth Child from the beginning. Though the offer, another chance for her to meet her mother, was in fact appealing. It was her fundamental reason to pilot the EVA in the first place, after all.  
明日香保持着右眼与渚薰的红色眼眸对视，进行着无声的瞪视较量。她从一开始就察觉到第五适格者有些不对劲。尽管那个提议，让她再次见到母亲的另一个机会，确实很诱人。毕竟，这正是她最初驾驶 EVA 的根本原因。

Then just maybe... 那么或许……

"No need. There's just no way I'm…partaking in some conspiracy with someone I don't even trust!" With that, Asuka quickly turned around and began making her leave.  
“不必了。我绝不可能……参与一个连我都无法信任的人的阴谋！”说完，明日香迅速转身，开始离开。

Kaworu Nagisa shook his head after the slender form of the Second Child disappeared around the corner. "Does Lilim differentiate from each other so much?" He asked, half to himself. Smirking as he felt another powerful existence making its way toward him. "The Angel of Womb…I wonder what will you bring?"  
渚薰在第二适格者的纤细身影消失在转角后摇了摇头。“人类之间的差异真的如此之大吗？”他自言自语道，嘴角微微上扬，感受到另一个强大存在的接近。“子宫天使……你会带来什么呢？”

"I hope this time, we can work together." If the Second Child wouldn't take the carrot, only the stick was left for him. Looking at the white ceiling of NERV's hallway, Kaworu started walking toward his assigned living quarters in the Geofront.  
"希望这次，我们能携手合作。" 如果二号机驾驶员不吃这一套，留给他的便只有棍棒了。望着 NERV 走廊上洁白的天花板，渚薰开始走向他在地底都市分配的住处。

"…trust me, I will explain everything…the next time I see you. Goodbye."  
“……相信我，我会解释一切……下次见面时。再见。”

With a sorrowful sigh, Shinji removed the headphone from his head, putting them on the table before him. A tape recording machine was sitting on the table, Shinji picked it up and pressed the eject button, then a cassette tape that perfectly fitted his SDAT popped out.  
带着一声哀伤的叹息，真嗣摘下了耳机，将其放在面前的桌上。一台磁带录音机摆在桌上，真嗣拿起它，按下弹出键，随即一盘完美适配他 SDAT 的磁带弹了出来。

After placing the tape into the dusty SDAT, Shinji put his former escape port on a relatively obvious spot on the table in his closet, but not noticeable unless after some searching effort.  
将磁带放入积满灰尘的 SDAT 后，真嗣把他曾经的逃生口放在衣柜桌子上一个相对显眼的位置，但除非经过一番搜寻，否则并不容易注意到。

It was almost like a ritual for him to do at this point. In almost every single one of his former loops, Shinji would record this speech as soon as Kaworu showed up. Even though the SDAT, the barrier that isolated him from the rest of the world, hadn't been used for a long time because escaping wasn't a word in his dictionary anymore – it could still be used as a last resort.  
对他来说，这几乎成了一种仪式。在他曾经的每一个循环中，真嗣都会在渚薰出现后立即录制这段演讲。尽管 SDAT 这个将他与世界隔绝的屏障已经很久没有使用，因为“逃避”这个词已不再出现在他的字典里——但它仍可作为最后的手段。

Though he didn't really know the point of doing it. Only under the condition that he's dead would the recording gain its use. But if without him piloting Unit 01, the world would be doomed anyway – from the Angels, or SEELE.  
虽然他并不真正明白这么做的意义何在。只有在他死去的情况下，这段录音才会派上用场。但若没有他驾驶初号机，世界无论如何都将面临毁灭——无论是来自使徒，还是 SEELE。

But as long as there's a little bit of hope…  
但只要还有一丝希望……

"Stupid Shinji! What's for today's breakfast, and why aren't you holding me when I woke up?" A familiar loud voice floated from the corridor, breaking him out of his train of thought. "Now come to me and fulfill your seriously neglected boyfriend duties!"  
"笨蛋真嗣！今天早餐吃什么，为什么我醒来的时候你不抱着我？" 一个熟悉的大嗓门从走廊飘来，打断了他的思绪。"现在过来履行你严重忽视的男朋友职责！"

"Coming, Asuka!" Shinji brought a warm smile to his face despite the sullen mood after finishing the recording, exiting the closet to see a pouting Asuka wearing the flimsy nightgown - basically showing every curve of her body - she wore last night when they fell asleep. He planted a quick kiss on her lips while holding her by her waist, to which Asuka reciprocated with equal passion. "The breakfast is ready on the table. Your favorite _Breakfast Combo Number One._" Said Shinji after they pulled away from the kiss.  
"来了，明日香！" 尽管录完音后心情有些阴郁，但真嗣还是露出了温暖的笑容，走出衣橱，看到明日香正穿着那件薄薄的睡裙——几乎勾勒出她身体的每一道曲线——那是昨晚他们入睡时她穿的。他迅速在她唇上印下一吻，同时搂住她的腰，明日香也以同样的热情回应了他。"早餐已经准备好了，是你最喜欢的早餐组合一号。" 真嗣在他们分开后说道。

"Wunderbar." Smiling an excited smile with a note of appreciation, Asuka walked over to the dining table barefoot and sat down on one of the chairs, kicking her slender legs as she stuffed the food into her mouth. "Say, where is Misato? She's not in her room."  
"太棒了。" 阿斯卡带着一丝感激的兴奋笑容，赤脚走到餐桌旁，坐在一把椅子上，一边踢着她纤细的双腿，一边把食物塞进嘴里。"话说，美里在哪里？她不在房间里。"

"She left a message. It seems she's got something to work on at NERV." Shinji shrugged.  
"她留了条信息。好像是有什么事要去 NERV 处理。" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"

"Oh well, she just left two horny teenagers who have the permission to have sex alone in the apartment." A mischievous look crossed her face. "You know what that means, right, Shinji?"  
"哦，她把两个得到允许可以做爱的青春期少男少女单独留在了公寓里。" 她脸上掠过一丝调皮的神情。"你知道这意味着什么，对吧，真嗣？"

"Asuka…we still have school today," Shinji said in exasperation. "I don't think either of us wants to get into the mood right now."  
"明日香…我们今天还有学校的事呢，" 真嗣无奈地说道。"我觉得我们现在都没心情做那事。"

"Hmph, you're no fun." Asuka pouted. "Still, what a responsible guardian Misato is."  
“哼，真没意思。”明日香撅嘴道，“不过，美里还真是个负责任的监护人呢。”

"I think she does care about us. She's just bad at showing it." Shinji sat down across the table from Asuka. It was the topic he didn't want to discuss right now. Asuka still hadn't learned about Kaji yet; he couldn't hide it from her forever, but the timing was a great concern for him.  
"我觉得她确实关心我们。只是她不擅长表达。" 真嗣坐在明日香对面的桌前。这是他现在不想讨论的话题。明日香还不知道关于加持的事；他不能永远瞒着她，但时机对他来说是个大问题。

"Yeah, yeah. Surrogate mothers and all that." Asuka remarked offhandedly. Her face dropped as the recollections of her conversation with Kaworu yesterday resurfaced. "Say, Shinji…do you miss your mother?"  
“是啊，是啊。代孕母亲什么的。”明日香随口说道。她的脸色一沉，昨天的对话在脑海中重现。“我说，真嗣……你会想念你妈妈吗？”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. "Not really." He replied truthfully, eliciting a surprised look from the redhead. "I mean, mothers are there to look after us, right? But we can still be independent without them. Even if…they aren't…gone, we still can't rely on them forever." His tone became firmer as he continued. "Asuka, I think I can live without constantly needing…people mothering me. It also means growing up, at least that's what I think."  
真嗣挑了挑眉。“并不完全是。”他如实回答，让红发女孩露出了惊讶的表情。“我是说，母亲的存在是为了照顾我们，对吧？但我们仍然可以在没有她们的情况下独立。即使……她们没有……离开，我们也不能永远依赖她们。”他继续说道，语气变得更加坚定。“明日香，我想我可以不总是需要……别人像母亲一样照顾我。这也意味着成长，至少我是这么认为的。”

"Growing up…" The phrase echoed inside her head. Truthfully if Kaworu's brought his proposal when she was still solely relying on the EVA, she probably would've jumped at the opportunity. But through Shinji she had came to learn a lot, especially that what she really needed and what she didn't.  
“成长……”这个词在她脑海中回响。说实话，如果渚薰在她还完全依赖 EVA 时提出他的提议，她可能会立刻抓住这个机会。但通过真嗣，她学到了很多，尤其是她真正需要什么，以及她不需要什么。

Learning to love another person indeed made her drop a few things in the past. In retrospect, she didn't regret it, at all. And growing up was what she had always wanted, wasn't it?  
学会爱另一个人确实让她放下了过去的一些东西。回想起来，她一点也不后悔。而成长正是她一直渴望的，不是吗？

"Shinji, do you know what's up with the Fifth Child?" After a mild battle with herself, Asuka finally reached liberation.  
"真嗣，你知道第五适格者是怎么回事吗？" 经过一番轻微的内心挣扎，明日香终于得到了解脱。

"What's wrong? Did he…upset you?" Shinji inquired, his voice carried a subtle hint of amusement if mapped out using audio analysis software. Kaworu's innate ability to piss off Asuka was another mystery that he had yet to solve.  
"怎么了？他……惹你生气了吗？" 真嗣询问道，如果用音频分析软件来解析，他的声音中隐约带着一丝笑意。渚薰惹恼明日香的天赋，是他至今未解的另一个谜。

"I guess you could say that. Aside from that, he tried to…seduce you, he's…just not right." Asuka shrugged. "Say, is he gay or something?"  
"可以这么说吧。除此之外，他还试图……诱惑你，他……就是不太对劲。" 明日香耸了耸肩。"话说，他是不是同性恋什么的？"

Shinji made a short mental laugh. Perhaps it was because of her woman sixth sense, Asuka had always been one of the first few people to smell the fishiness of Kaworu, excluding his father and other few people who knew the real identity of the Angel of free will. "Perhaps, perhaps not." He gave a non-committal answer.  
碇真嗣在心里轻笑了一声。或许是因为她那女性特有的第六感，明日香总是最先察觉到渚薰身上异样气息的几个人之一，除了他的父亲和其他少数知晓这位自由意志天使真实身份的人。“或许吧，或许也不是。”他给出了一个模棱两可的回答。

"Whatever. Just stay away from him, Shinji." Asuka bit down on her food. "Also, I have a plan for you after school today." She smirked.  
“随你便。离他远点，真嗣。”明日香咬了一口食物，“还有，今天放学后我有个计划要你执行。”她得意地笑了笑。

"That is?" “那是？”

"You'll see when we get there."  
“到了你就知道了。”

Inside the server room of the MAGI supercomputer system, Misato unfolded her laptop and placed it on her lap while she dug through the deepest depths of the monstrous computer's data. The room was at a chilling temperature of about three degrees Celsius maintained by liquid nitrogen and powerful ventilation systems, to keep the colossal machine that was generating a massive amount of heat at acceptable working temperatures.  
在 MAGI 超级计算机系统的服务器室内，美里展开她的笔记本电脑，放在膝上，深入挖掘这台巨型计算机最深处的数据。房间维持在约三摄氏度的低温，由液氮和强大的通风系统维持，以确保这台产生大量热量的庞大机器保持在可接受的运行温度。

Though it didn't help stop Misato's sweat from dripping down her forehead as she hacked into the supercomputer. Espionage wasn't exactly the job she was paid for, nor was she skilled in the subject of matter. However, with the small flash drive that contained strings of code that Kaji provided her with, it made getting through the system much easier. Still, her ministrations were flawed if seen by experts.  
尽管如此，这并未阻止美里的汗水从额头滴落，因为她正在入侵超级计算机。间谍活动并非她的本职工作，也不是她的专长。然而，有了加持提供给她的那个装有代码串的小闪存盘，穿越系统变得容易多了。不过，若被专家看到，她的操作仍有不少缺陷。

After what felt like hours upon hours of getting nowhere, a new page finally opened up. One that she hadn't seen before. "The recorded data of Unit 01 during the battle against the twelfth and the thirteenth?" The lavender-haired woman's eyes lit up at the sight, and she quickly scanned her eyes up and down the page. Though she could only access the information since it wasn't classified at the highest level, or the safety protocols developed by Dr. Akagi would've already reported her to the central system.  
在经历了仿佛无尽的徒劳之后，终于翻开了一页新的篇章。一页她之前未曾见过的内容。“初号机在与第十二使徒和第十三使徒战斗中的记录数据？”这位紫发女子的眼睛因这一发现而亮了起来，她迅速上下扫视着页面。虽然她只能访问这些信息，因为它们并未被归类为最高机密，否则赤木博士开发的安全协议早已将她上报给中央系统。

"How?" She frowned. No matter how hard it was for her to believe, the data was disturbingly similar to the recorded readings when the Second Impact happened, at least at parts where Unit 01 went into a near-berserk state. "Was…Unit 01 starting another impact by itself?"  
“怎么会？”她皱眉。无论多么难以置信，这些数据与第二次冲击发生时的记录读数惊人地相似，至少在初号机近乎狂暴状态的部分是如此。“难道……初号机正在自行引发另一次冲击？”

Misato shook her head. She knew the EVAs were a copy of the first Angel which initiated the Second Impact. Perhaps it was only a biological similarity; the readings didn't make sense to her, anyway. "Thank you, Kaji." Pulling out the memory card he had given her out of her pocket, she placed a kiss onto it before plugging it into her laptop and copying over all the information.  
美里摇了摇头。她知道 EVA 是复制了引发第二次冲击的首个使徒。或许这只是生物学上的相似性；无论如何，这些读数对她来说毫无意义。“谢谢你，加持。”她从口袋里掏出他给她的记忆卡，轻轻一吻后将其插入笔记本电脑，开始复制所有信息。

Misato tapped her foot impatiently as she watched the bar fill up on the screen as the information was copied over into the memory card. Though she was confident that no one would come into this long-forgotten section of Central Dogma, the fear of something happening before the download could finish resonated within her.  
美里不耐烦地用脚敲打着地面，目光紧盯着屏幕上逐渐填满的进度条，数据正被复制到记忆卡中。尽管她自信无人会闯入这早已被遗忘的中央教条区一角，但下载完成前可能发生的意外仍让她心存忧虑。

Suddenly she could hear footsteps getting closer to the room she was sitting in. "Just a little bit more…" Misato loaded her pistol and released the safety, holding it with her right hand, while her left hand was placed at the edge of her laptop's screen. This way, as soon as the download was finished, she could shut it off and assume a defensive position.  
突然，她听到脚步声越来越接近她所在的房间。“再快一点……”美里迅速装填好手枪，解除保险，右手持枪，左手则放在笔记本电脑屏幕边缘。这样一来，下载一完成，她就能立即关闭电脑并进入防御状态。

At first she had thought people outside were there to arrest her that they've found out about her espionage, however she soon realized herself wrong since the footsteps weren't in a hurry at all. If they were to take her into custody, they wouldn't come at a pacing rate.  
起初，她以为门外的人是来逮捕她的，因为他们发现了她的间谍行为，然而她很快意识到自己错了，因为那些脚步声一点也不急促。如果他们要拘留她，不会以这种悠闲的步伐前来。

Nonetheless, the footsteps were coming louder and clearer as time passed. Misato took a deep breath after the download was completed and shut off the laptop, hiding behind the door. The room was at the end of the hallway without alternate routes, so sooner or later, she would be discovered.  
然而，随着时间的推移，脚步声愈发响亮清晰。下载完成后，美里深吸一口气，关闭了笔记本电脑，躲在门后。房间位于走廊尽头，没有其他出口，因此迟早会被发现。

Just as the footstep came to a peak, another blaring sound swept across the whole building; the person outside the door ran away at a hurried pace, judging from the increased rate of the tapping sound.  
就在脚步声达到顶峰时，另一阵刺耳的声响横扫了整个建筑；门外的人似乎急匆匆地跑开了，从那越来越快的脚步声可以判断出来。

Though it didn't help Misato to relax. It was the Angel alarm.  
尽管这并未让美里放松下来。那是天使警报。

"Asuka…what are we doing here?" Shinji's voice became increasingly nervous as he and Asuka walked along the pedestrian street of Tokyo-3 commercial district. The place could be considered a fine place for dating, but judging from her expression, it definitely wasn't on her mind today. Moreover, as they walked, a specific place that Shinji dreaded to go was getting closer and closer to them.  
“明日香…我们在这里做什么？”真嗣的声音越来越紧张，他和明日香走在第三新东京市商业区的步行街上。这个地方可以说是约会的绝佳场所，但从她的表情来看，今天她显然没有这个念头。而且，随着他们前行，真嗣最不愿去的一个地方正越来越近。

"Just wait and see," Asuka replied, looking left and right as if trying to locate the destination she was heading to. People were giving her strange looks directed at her eyepatch, though it did little to piss her off as she had already accepted her new appearance.  
“等着瞧吧，”明日香回答道，左右张望着，仿佛在寻找她要前往的目的地。人们向她投来奇怪的目光，集中在她的眼罩上，但这几乎不会惹恼她，因为她已经接受了新的外貌。

Unfortunately, Shinji's nightmare came true as Asuka stopped in front of the shop.  
不幸的是，真嗣的噩梦成真了，因为明日香在商店前停下了脚步。

_MIKIMOTO Tokyo-3 Main Store  
MIKIMOTO 东京-3 总店_

"What are you waiting for, Shinji?" Asuka gave him a puzzled expression, taking a grip on his wrist. "Let's get in."  
“你在等什么，真嗣？”明日香带着困惑的表情，抓住了他的手腕。“我们进去吧。”

"But… isn't this place for…buying jewelry?" The face he was making left no question of how he felt about this place. "Do you have something on your mind?"  
“但…这不是买珠宝的地方吗？”他脸上的表情清楚地表明了他对这个地方的感受。“你有什么心事吗？”

"Of course. We are gonna buy rings." Said Asuka nonchalantly, seemed to be completely ignoring the heavy implications of her statement. "I mean, what else could I buy in a jewelry store?"  
“当然。我们要去买戒指。”明日香漫不经心地说道，似乎完全忽略了这句话的沉重含义。“我是说，在珠宝店里还能买什么别的呢？”

"Rings? What rings?" Shinji tried to maintain a steady voice, offering only mild resistance as Asuka dragged him into the store.  
"戒指？什么戒指？" 真嗣试图保持平稳的语调，在被明日香拽进店里时只表现出轻微的抗拒。

"Promise rings, of course." Even though she tried to hide it, sadness still slipped out of her voice. "To signify our commitment to each other."  
“当然是承诺戒指。”尽管她试图掩饰，但悲伤还是从她的声音中流露出来。“象征我们对彼此的承诺。”

Shinji let out a silent sigh of relief. The last time he came to this place Asuka proposed to him with the wedding ring she bought – well, not exactly a proper proposal, but it was the end result. The reason why he was against the idea was simple – there was no future for them, and it would only hurt her more if she committed more.  
真嗣无声地松了一口气。上次他来到这个地方时，明日香拿着她买的婚戒向他求婚——好吧，并不是正式的求婚，但结果就是那样。他反对这个想法的原因很简单——他们没有未来，如果她投入更多，只会让她更加受伤。

This time though, a promise ring was a reasonable compromise between a verbal statement and a wedding proposition. Still, he really didn't want Asuka to commit more than she already had, at least not until the whole world was saved from Angels and SEELE. In fact, under that scenario, he would be the one making the proposal instead of Asuka. "Sure, I guess we can finally put our pilot wages into good use, then."  
不过这一次，承诺戒指成了口头声明与求婚之间合理的折中。尽管如此，他真的不希望明日香承诺更多，至少在全世界从使徒和 SEELE 手中获救之前。事实上，在那种情况下，他会是提出求婚的那个人，而不是明日香。“当然，我想我们终于可以把驾驶员的薪水派上用场了。”

"Emm, you bet." Asuka chirped, walking to the closest counter. She forced a smile to her face as she made eye contact with the salesperson. It wasn't like she only wanted a promise ring. Even though she was still scared about marriage – something so distant to her – she knew Shinji would be the one in her life.  
“嗯，当然。”明日香轻快地说道，走向最近的柜台。她努力在脸上挤出微笑，与售货员对上了目光。并非她只想要一枚承诺戒指。尽管她对婚姻仍心存恐惧——那对她来说如此遥远——但她知道，真嗣将是她生命中的那个人。

However, she couldn't bring herself to propose – she was still possessed by the Angel, and the future still seemed to be dark to her. No matter how much she wanted to propose right now and there, only after she made sure that she could hold on to her own promise – that she would never leave him – then it would be a valid option. She just couldn't propose to him while wearing a bomb on her neck and having an Angel in her body.  
然而，她无法鼓起勇气求婚——她仍被天使附身，未来对她来说依旧黯淡。无论她多么想立刻求婚，只有在她确保自己能坚守承诺——永不离开他——之后，这才会是一个可行的选择。她不能在脖子上戴着炸弹、体内有天使的情况下向他求婚。

"How can I help you, young lady?" The salesperson said in a professional voice.  
“有什么能帮到您的吗，小姐？”售货员以专业的口吻说道。

"I want a pair of promise rings for me and that idiot over there." She pointed at Shinji, who was wearing a sad smile of his own.  
“我要一对情侣戒指，给我和那边那个傻瓜。”她指着真嗣，他正挂着一抹苦笑。

"What material do you want?"  
“你想要什么材料？”

"Silver rings with diamonds."  
"镶钻的银戒指。"

"Sure. Weight of the diamonds?"  
当然。钻石的重量是多少？

"One carat should be enough."  
"一克拉应该足够了。"

"Of course. Do you want your names imprinted on the rings?" The female salesperson took out a sheet of paper and a ballpen from the cabinet.  
"当然可以。您希望戒指上刻上名字吗？" 女销售员从柜子里拿出一张纸和一支笔。

"Yes." Asuka took the paper and the pen from her, writing down her and Shinji's names.  
“好的。” 明日香从她手中接过纸和笔，写下了她和真嗣的名字。

"Here, let me measure your finger sizes." After taking care of it, the salesperson handed Asuka a piece of paper. "Alright. Here's your voucher." The salesperson smiled a professional smile. "Come and pick up your rings in three days."  
“来，让我量一下你们的指围。” 处理完之后，销售员递给明日香一张纸。“好了。这是您的凭证。” 销售员露出职业性的微笑。“三天后来取你们的戒指。”

"Thank you." Asuka smiled back, turning to look at Shinji with a smirk, who smiled a warm smile in response. "Now let's get something to eat. I'm starv-"  
“谢谢。” 明日香回以微笑，转头看向真嗣，带着一丝戏谑，真嗣则回以温暖的笑容。“现在我们去吃点东西吧。我快饿——”

Her speech was interrupted by the simultaneous vibration of her and Shinji's phones. Both pilots took out their devices and looked at each other with determined expressions before hurrying out of the store, leaving a slightly confused salesperson alone in the room.  
她的演讲被她和真嗣手机同时的震动打断了。两位驾驶员取出设备，相互交换了一个坚定的眼神，随即匆匆离开了店铺，留下一位略感困惑的店员独自在房间里。

Misato looked up at the monitor of the Command Center, staring at the strange creature hovering over the open fields of Tokyo-3. To call it a creature felt wrong, as unlike any of the previous Angels, it showed no forms of anatomy similar to that of the creatures of Earth. It had no arms, legs, eyes, or even a face to speak of. The Angel could only be described as a glowing halo formed by a double helix.  
美里抬头看着指挥中心的监视器，盯着那只悬浮在东京-3 开阔田野上的奇怪生物。称之为生物似乎不妥，因为它与之前的使徒不同，没有显示出任何与地球生物相似的解剖结构。它没有手臂、腿、眼睛，甚至没有脸。这个使徒只能被描述为一个由双螺旋构成的发光光环。

"This Angel looks creepy. I've never seen anything even close to this ever before." Major Katsuragi remarked, staring in awe at the being.  
“这个使徒看起来真诡异。我从未见过任何与之相近的东西。”葛城美里少校惊叹道，凝视着那个存在。

"Neither have the MAGI, apparently." Ritsuko replied, looking over Maya's shoulder and glancing over the readings on her monitor. "The constant shift in its molecular structures is making MAGI confused, it keeps switching between pattern orange and blue. We don't even know if its an Angel or not."  
“显然，MAGI 系统也搞不清楚。”律子回答道，目光越过玛雅的肩膀，扫视着她显示器上的读数。“其分子结构的持续变化让 MAGI 系统混乱，不断在橙色和蓝色模式间切换。我们甚至不确定它是不是使徒。”

"It can't be anything else." Misato shrugged as she approached the microphone, letting out a sigh before speaking up. "Are the pilots of our EVAs prepped and ready?"  
"不可能有别的解释了。" 美里耸了耸肩，走向麦克风，叹了口气后开口问道，"我们的 EVA 驾驶员都准备好了吗？"

"The pilots are all inside their respective entry plugs. Preparing the EVAs onto the launch shafts." Aoba reported.  
“驾驶员们都已进入各自的插入栓内。正在将 EVA 准备到发射井中。”青叶报告道。

"Right." Misato returned her gaze at the big screen. Now they had four operational EVAs at hand – all remaining EVAs in the whole world. They could literally conquer the planet if they had enough power. Though the thought did little to soothe her nervousness as the Angel hovered stationary above Tokyo-3.  
“好的。”美里将目光转回大屏幕。现在他们手头有四台可操作的 EVA——全世界仅存的 EVA。如果拥有足够的能量，他们几乎可以征服整个星球。然而，这个想法并未能缓解她因天使静止在第三新东京市上空而产生的紧张情绪。

Shinji took a deep breath of the LCL around him as he braced for the overweight sensation of EVA shooting up the surface. Armisale had always been a formidable enemy to deal with, at least in the beginning. It was until he found out that the Angel would only go after activated AT-Fields he finally found a consistent way to deal with the Angel that would always take one with it.  
真嗣深吸了一口周围的 LCL，准备迎接 EVA 冲出水面时那超重的感受。阿米萨尔一直是个难以对付的敌人，至少在最初是这样。直到他发现这只使徒只会攻击激活的 AT 力场，他才终于找到了一种始终如一的对付这只总是带走一个使徒的方法。

Putting the sense of achievement aside, Shinji opened an encrypted voice channel to EVA Unit 02. "Asuka, can you hear me?"  
暂且放下成就感，真嗣打开了一个加密的语音频道，连接到 EVA 二号机。“明日香，你能听到我吗？”

"Loud and clear. What's on your mind, Shinji? Using an encrypted channel?" Asuka replied, her voice carrying a note of curiosity.  
"“响亮又清晰。你在想什么呢，真嗣？用加密频道联系我？”明日香回答道，声音中带着一丝好奇。”

"No matter what you do… don't activate your AT-Field, alright?"  
"“无论你做什么……别激活你的 AT 力场，好吗？””

"Why? AT-Fields are our most powerful weapon." She gave a clearly confused response.  
"“为什么？AT 力场是我们最强大的武器。”她明显困惑地回应道。”

"Just do it." Shinji's voice turned stern and cold, eliciting a chill ran down Asuka's spine. She had never heard him using such a tone to her ever before.  
"就这么做。" 真嗣的声音变得严厉而冷漠，让明日香感到一阵寒意窜上脊背。她从未听他用这种语气对她说过话。

"Alright." Asuka nodded.  
"好的。" 明日香点头道。

"Keep an eye on Kaworu. Stay behind his EVA if possible." Shinji stated. "He might do something for all I know."  
“盯着一点儿渚薰。如果可能的话，跟在他的 EVA 后面。”真嗣说道，“据我所知，他可能会做出些什么。”

"Shinji, what's going on?" Asuka inquired, her voice growing increasingly nervous. "What do you know?"  
“真嗣，发生什么事了？”明日香问道，她的声音越来越紧张。“你知道些什么？”

"I'll explain…later. For now, just trust me. Do you trust me, Asuka?"  
“我稍后解释……现在，请相信我。你相信我吗，明日香？”

"Yes, I do." "是的，我相信。"

Asuka shook the thoughts out of her head. Now it's not the time to think about something like that. Her trust in Shinji was absolute; so if he had something in mind, no matter how strange it sounded to her, since he had promised to explain later, she had no problems following him. "Misato, I'm ready!"  
明日香甩开这些念头。现在不是考虑这种事的时候。她对真嗣的信任是绝对的；所以如果他有什么打算，无论听起来多么奇怪，既然他承诺稍后解释，她就没有问题跟随他。“美里，我准备好了！”

"I'm ready as well!" Finally, Shinji's voice came into the channel as well.  
“我也准备好了！”终于，真嗣的声音也在频道中响起。

"Right. EVAs launch!" Misato ordered. After Unit 00, Unit 01, Unit 02, and Unit 03 went up to the surface, she then said, "Unit 00 will use the sniper rifle, and the remaining Units will engage in close-quarters combat. Understood?"  
“好。EVA 启动！”美里命令道。在零号机、初号机、二号机和三号机升至地面后，她接着说：“零号机使用狙击步枪，其余机体进行近战。明白了吗？”

All of the pilots gave verbal confirmations. On the battlefield, Unit 00 already remained in position, totting its sniper rifle in hand. Crouching down behind a series of trees, Shinji looked on at the Angel as it spiraled around in its fixed position. He scanned up and down it for its core, but was unable to find it, just like every time.  
所有驾驶员都口头确认了。战场上，零号机已经就位，手持狙击步枪。真嗣蹲在一排树后，注视着天使在其固定位置上盘旋。他上下扫描寻找其核心，但和每次一样，未能找到。

"Shinji," Misato's voice came through, filling the cockpit. "Just hold back and let us study it for a bit. We don't have a good idea on how to approach it yet." Almost as soon as the words came through, the spiraling double helix slowly ceased its spiraling, coming to a complete stop. "No." The brown-haired pilot spoke, his cobalt eyes narrowing on the Angel. "It's coming!"  
“真嗣，”美里通过通讯器传来声音，充满了驾驶舱。“先克制一下，让我们研究一会儿。我们还不清楚该如何应对它。”话音刚落，那螺旋状的双螺旋结构缓缓停止了旋转，完全静止下来。“不。”棕发驾驶员说道，他那蔚蓝的眼睛紧盯着使徒。“它要来了！”

Shinji wasted no time and expanded his AT-Field. The Angel sensed the presence of the rather strong light of the soul, and within a matter of seconds, the double helix that made up the Angel started to morph together, bonding it into one single form. Then with a shriek, the halo split in two, morphing it into a long, thread-like shape. With blinding speed, one of its ends shot forward as its tip formed into a fine point, lunging at Unit 01 like a spear.  
真嗣毫不犹豫地展开了自己的 AT 力场。使徒感知到了那强烈的灵魂之光，几秒钟内，构成使徒的双螺旋结构开始变形融合，凝聚成单一形态。随后，伴随着一声尖啸，光环一分为二，变形为细长的线状。以惊人的速度，其一端向前猛射，尖端化作锋利的矛头，如长矛般直刺 01 号机。

Kaworu narrowed his red eyes on the Angel as he tried to reach out to the Angel of Womb. The surroundings seemed to slow down with time as he focused.  
薰的红眸紧盯着使徒，试图与子宫天使建立联系。随着他的专注，周围的一切似乎都随着时间放缓了。

_Tabris. 塔布里斯。_

Kaworu smirked. 渚薰微微一笑。

_Armisael. I see you have chosen your target.  
阿米沙尔。看来你已经选定了目标。_

_This is the only way. The light of soul leads me.  
这是唯一的路。灵魂之光指引着我。_

Kaworu shook his head. As much as was interested in the Third Child, the call from Adam was growing increasingly irresistible. The best and most efficient way was to attack with Armisael in unison, however, with three working EVAs on the field, the chance felt remote.  
渚薰摇了摇头。尽管他对第三适格者颇感兴趣，但来自亚当的召唤却愈发难以抗拒。最有效的方法是与亚尔玛赛尔协同攻击，然而，场上有三台运作中的 EVA，这种机会显得渺茫。

Not to mention the crimson EVA Unit seemed to be keeping an eye on him, which only lowered his chance. He silently cursed at SEELE's plan developed for him to follow – they thought they had the Second Child all figured out psychologically, but after yesterday's interaction, Kaworu felt it only raised more suspicion.  
更别提那台猩红的 EVA 机体似乎一直在监视他，这只会降低他的机会。他默默地咒骂 SEELE 为他制定的计划——他们自以为完全摸透了二号机驾驶员的心理，但经过昨天的互动，渚薰觉得这反而增加了更多的疑虑。

Fixing a gaze at the Angel of Womb, Kaworu knew there was only one way to make it easier for him to achieve his ultimate goal. Though he felt bad sacrificing Armisael, it was for the greater good.  
凝视着子宫天使，渚薰知道只有一种方法能让实现他的最终目标变得更容易。虽然牺牲亚米沙让他感到内疚，但这是为了更大的利益。

_I will guide your attacks. Follow my directions.  
我将引导你的攻击。请遵循我的指示。_

On the battlefield, Shinji's eyes went wide as the Angel turned 180 degrees just in front of him and stabbed toward the black Unit 03 – or more precisely, the crimson EVA Unit 02 behind it.  
战场上，真嗣的眼睛瞪得大大的，只见使徒在他面前旋转了 180 度，直刺向黑色的初号机——更确切地说，是它身后的赤红二号机。

"No!"

Asuka shrieked in surprise and tried to dodge the sudden attack, though the Angel was faster than it had been. The white strand-like substance slammed directly into the chest of Unit 02, forcing itself through the armor plating as Asuka's screams filled out the communication channel.  
明日香惊叫一声，试图躲避这突如其来的攻击，但使徒的速度比之前更快。那白色的丝状物质直接撞击在二号机的胸前，强行穿透了装甲板，明日香的尖叫声充斥着通讯频道。

On the observation deck, Gendo Ikari narrowed his eyes.  
在观测台上，碇源堂眯起了眼睛。

"Oh my God!" Ritsuko's eyes went wide as she watched the battle unfold before her. "The Angel is trying to make first-level contact with Unit 02."  
"哦，天哪！" 律子的眼睛瞪得大大的，她目睹着战斗在她眼前展开。"使徒正试图与零二号机进行一级接触。"

"All remaining EVAs!" Misato shouted into the microphone. "Assist Unit 02! Help out Asuka!"  
“所有剩余的 EVA！”美里对着麦克风大喊，“支援二号机！帮助明日香！”

She hardly needed to tell him. Shinji was already dashing on his feet, rushing toward the struggling Unit 02. He didn't have time to think about why the Angel would behave abnormally – saving Asuka was his primary concern.  
她几乎不需要告诉他。真嗣已经在奔跑，冲向挣扎中的二号机。他没有时间去思考使徒为何会表现出异常行为——救明日香是他首要的关切。

Kaworu watched the purple EVA Unit running toward him with a sad smile. He expanded Unit 03's AT-Field and combined it with the Angel's, empowering its strength by an exponent.  
渚薰看着紫色 EVA 单位朝他跑来，带着悲伤的微笑。他展开三号机的 AT 力场，并与使徒的力场结合，使其力量倍增。

"It's… It's trying to get inside of me! Ugh! So disgusting!"  
"它……它想钻进我身体里！呃！太恶心了！"

Unit 01 slammed into a powerful AT-Field just as it was about to reach Unit 02, unable to move forward by an inch.  
初号机刚要触及二号机时，猛地撞上了一道强大的 AT 力场，寸步难行。

"Damn it! Why won't you go through!" Shinji cried, unable to think clearly about why he couldn't go through the AT-Field as his mind was in a swirl produced by Asuka's pained screams. "Rei! Kaworu! Help me neutralize the AT-Field!"  
"该死！为什么穿不过去！"" 真嗣喊道，由于明日香痛苦的尖叫声让他的思绪一片混乱，无法清晰思考为何无法突破 AT 力场。""绫波！渚薰！帮我中和 AT 力场！"

"Roger." "On my way." "罗杰。" "在路上。"

From his sideways vision, Shinji could see Unit 00 soon joining him to help push through the AT-Field, while Unit 03 was trying to cut through it with a small knife. Though to no avail as they still weren't making any progress.  
从他的侧视中，真嗣可以看到零零号机很快就会加入他，帮助突破 AT 力场，而零三号机正试图用一把小刀切开它。尽管这一切都徒劳无功，他们仍然没有取得任何进展。

"Asuka! Don't do anything stupid! I promise we'll save you, just hold on for a little longer!"  
"明日香！别做傻事！我保证我们会救你的，再坚持一会儿！"

Letting out a roar, Shinji pushed forward with his EVA one more time. He had to push through this field, even if he had to call for his mother's help. No matter how much it would cost him, he had to save her, just like what he had always been doing ever before.  
发出一声怒吼，真嗣再次推动他的 EVA 前进。他必须穿越这片战场，哪怕这意味着要呼唤母亲的援助。无论代价多大，他都必须救她，就像他一直以来所做的那样。

Though to no avail as he saw the Angel suddenly grow rigid and then fully enters Unit 02 in mere seconds.  
然而无济于事，因为他看到使徒突然僵硬，然后在几秒钟内完全进入了 02 号机。

"ASUKA!" “明日香！”

"What is she doing? Oh my god she's inverting her AT-Field!" Misato's panicked voice came to him over the speakers, making Shinji's blood run cold.  
“她在做什么？天哪，她在反转 AT 力场！”美里通过扬声器传来的惊慌声音，让真嗣感到血液凝固。

"Mode D activated! Thirty seconds till self-destruct!"  
"模式 D 启动！三十秒后自毁！"

"Pilot Ikari's sync rate is rising fast! Two hundred, three hundred percent! Still hasn't stopped!"  
"碇司令的同步率正在急速上升！两百，三百百分比！还在继续！"

"So I guess this is the end huh…" Asuka's voice echoed through Shinji's cockpit as Unit 02 continued to move over to the edge of the city. "Damn…I still have a lot of things to say…"  
"看来这就是终点了啊…" 明日香的声音在真嗣的驾驶舱中回响，二号机继续向城市的边缘移动。"该死…我还有很多话想说…"

"NOOOO!" Shinji screamed a twisted scream. _MOTHER! PLEASE!_  
“不！！！” 真嗣发出一声扭曲的尖叫。“妈妈！求你了！”

_SNAP_

On the command deck, Gendo Ikari slammed his palms on the table and shot up from his seat.  
在指挥甲板上，碇源堂猛地双手拍在桌子上，从座位上站了起来。

**Chapter 38: The Way 第 38 章：道路**

At the outer perimeter of Tokyo-3, a lone figure stood beside a large crater created by a powerful explosion with her single eye filled with sadness.  
在第三东京市的外围，一个孤独的身影站在一个由强力爆炸造成的大坑旁，她的独眼中充满了悲伤。

_Gendo Ikari shot up from his seat and shouted down to the command deck, "raise the concentration of the LCL of Unit 02's entry plug to maximum! Override the systems from our side!"  
碇源堂猛地从座位上站起来，对着指挥台大喊：“将二号机插入栓内的 LCL 浓度调至最大！从我们这边强行接管系统！”_

_"But…" Maya hesitated. “但是……” 美里犹豫道。_

_"That's a damn ORDER! Do it, NOW!"  
“这是命令，给我立刻执行！”_

_"Roger!" Maya raised her eyebrows. In her impression, Gendo Ikari had always been a calm and collected man, sometimes even eerily cold. She had never seen, or rather, never expected to see him so agitated to the extent of swearing.  
“收到！” 美里挑了挑眉。在她印象中，碇源堂一直是个冷静沉着的人，有时甚至冷得让人毛骨悚然。她从未见过，或者说，从未预料到会看到他如此激动，甚至到了咒骂的地步。_

_Shaking the thoughts aside, she hastily punched the commands into her terminal. "Raising the LCL concentration to maximum! Overriding the control interface of Unit 02!"  
她摇摇头，抛开杂念，迅速在终端上输入指令。“将 LCL 浓度提升至最大！接管 02 号机的控制界面！”_

Asuka gulped at the memory. Being suffocated in the condensed LCL wasn't a pleasant feeling.  
回忆起那一幕，明日香不禁咽了口唾沫。在浓缩的 LCL 中窒息绝非愉快的体验。

_"Unit 02 has shut down! The pilot is unconscious! Plug ejection successful!" Maya reported.  
“02 号机已关闭！驾驶员失去意识！插头弹射成功！”真希波报告道。_

_An immobile EVA Unit without a human inside left no value for Armisael to continue to corrode into as the Angel let go of damaged Unit 02 and rose into the air.  
一台无人驾驶的静止 EVA 对亚尔玛赛尔而言已无价值可继续侵蚀，天使放开了受损的 02 号机，升入空中。_

"Stupid Shinji," Asuka whispered to herself. "Stupid! Stupid! Playing the big hero again!" She hissed, picking up a stone from the ground and threw it with all of her might. "You promised to never leave me!"  
“笨蛋真嗣，”明日香自言自语道。“笨蛋！笨蛋！又逞英雄！”她低声咒骂，从地上捡起一块石头，用尽全力扔了出去。“你答应过永远不会离开我的！”

_"Pilot Ikari's sync rate is spiking! It had already surpassed four hundred percent!"  
"碇司令的同步率正在飙升！已经超过了四百个百分点！"_

_"No…" Dr. Akagi mumbled. "不……" 赤木博士喃喃自语。_

_On the battlefield, Unit 01 roared as its powerful AT-Field exploded, ripping off layers of earth from the surface, creating a massive crater around it. Unit 03 was sent flying away as it stood too close to the berserk EVA.  
战场上，01 号机咆哮着，其强大的 AT 力场爆发，撕裂了地表的层层土壤，围绕其周围形成了一个巨大的弹坑。03 号机因站得过近而被狂暴的 EVA 震飞出去。_

_The Angel soon chose its next target as it lunged at Unit 01, though it soon found the idea deadly. Unit 01 took a firm hold of the Angel with both of its hands, preventing it from escaping. Armisael tried to contaminate the EVA, but it couldn't even get through its AT-Field.  
天使很快锁定了下一个目标，向初号机猛扑过去，却很快意识到这是个致命的错误。初号机用双手牢牢抓住天使，使其无法逃脱。阿米沙耶试图污染 EVA，但连其 AT 力场都无法突破。_

_Unit 01's jaw joint cracked open, revealing its terrifying teeth.  
初号机的下颌关节猛地裂开，露出了其骇人的利齿。_

_"It's happening." Ritsuko sounded utterly terrified. "It has awakened."  
"正在发生。" 律子听起来完全吓坏了。"它已经觉醒了。"_

_Once it had a firm grip on the Angel, the EVA lowered its head into the white strand and began to devour the entrails of the monster.  
一旦牢牢抓住了使徒，EVA 便将头埋进那白色丝带中，开始吞噬那怪物的内脏。_

_Misato stared at the incredulous scene with a horrified expression, unable to believe what was going on with Unit 01 and the Angel, but her eyes couldn't lie to her.  
美里目瞪口呆地盯着这难以置信的场景，脸上露出惊恐的表情，无法相信零一号机和使徒之间发生的事情，但她的眼睛无法欺骗她。_

_Unit 01 was eating the Angel.  
初号机正在吞噬使徒。_

_The Evangelion viciously took another bite on the Angel's flesh, ripping off a large chunk of its white body, swallowing it whole. As Ritsuko watched on, she gasped at what it had just done.  
福音战士凶猛地又咬了一口使徒的肉体，撕下一大块白色的躯体，整个吞下。丽看着这一幕，不禁倒吸一口凉气。_

_"Wait...I think the EVA is trying to devour the S2 organ!" Her eyes went wide as the dreaded realization struck her._ _"Unit 01 has become completely self-aware and is now devouring it for its own personal gains!"_  
“等等...我觉得 EVA 是在试图吞噬 S2 机关！”她的眼睛瞪得大大的，恐惧的现实击中了她。“初号机已经完全自我觉醒，现在正在为了自己的利益而吞噬它！”

_"Wait, what?!" Misato looked away from the big screen for a moment, turning her glare towards Dr. Akagi. "How can these things think for themselves?!"  
"等等，什么？！" 美里从大屏幕上移开目光，转向赤木博士，眼神中带着怒意。"这些家伙怎么能自己思考？！"_

_"The armor plates we put on them weren't only for defense, but to restrain the EVA's power." Dr. Akagi explained, her voice in a whisper. "Now that it has broke out of the restraints, it has gained its own free will. There's nothing we can do to stop it now.__"_  
"我们给它们装上的装甲板不仅是为了防御，更是为了限制 EVA 的力量。" 赤木博士解释道，声音低沉。"现在它挣脱了束缚，获得了自由意志。我们现在已经无法阻止它了。"

_"Oh God." Misato looked back at the EVA, watching it devouring the Angel chunk by chunk.  
"哦，天哪。" 美里回头看向 EVA，只见它正一块块地吞噬着使徒。_

_With its restraints all but gone, the EVA returned to its meal, feasting on the flesh of its enemy. As it finished devouring its foe, Misato shook her head in complete disbelief. She knew what the EVAs were made of, but she had never expected to see anything like this. Was the EVA turning into an Angel as well? That would be the irony of the century - the tool they had used to fight off the Angels was now turning against them.  
束缚几乎完全解除，EVA 重新开始享用它的餐食，大口吞噬着敌人的血肉。当它终于将对手吞噬殆尽，美里难以置信地摇了摇头。她知道 EVA 的构造，但从未料想过会目睹这样的情景。难道 EVA 也在变成使徒吗？那将是本世纪最大的讽刺——他们用来对抗使徒的工具如今却转而对抗他们。_

_The group continued watching on in horror while Unit 01 rose from its feast and roared a blood-boiling roar.  
小队成员继续惊恐地注视着，零号机从盛宴中站起，发出一声令人血脉贲张的咆哮。_

_Kaworu Nagisa watched the EVA roar with a stern expression. When Unit 01's eyes made contact with him through Unit 03's monitors, he felt a bone-chilling shiver ran down his spine. Maybe his reunion with Adam could still wait.  
渚薰凝视着 EVA 的咆哮，神情严峻。当零号机 1 型的目光透过 3 号机的监视器与他交汇时，他感到一股寒意直透脊背。或许他与亚当的重逢仍可稍待片刻。_

"Stupid Shinji!" Asuka cried a final scream, then headed to the place where she had been dreading to go for days.  
“笨蛋真嗣！”明日香发出最后的尖叫，然后朝那个她多日来一直害怕去的地方走去。

"Welcome back, young lady." The salesperson kept her professional smile as Asuka walked closer to the counter. "Your rings are ready waiting for you. Your voucher, please?"  
"欢迎回来，小姑娘。" 销售员保持着职业微笑，当明日香走近柜台时。"您的戒指已经准备好了，请出示您的凭证。"

Asuka sighed and handed the ticket to the salesperson, her expression pained.  
明日香叹了口气，将票递给售票员，脸上露出痛苦的表情。

The salesperson's face dropped immediately as she felt the pain that radiated from the redhead. As a person who had met a lot of couples before, she could confidently label Asuka's expression as _extremely hurt_, and only one reason made sense to her. "Where is your boyfriend? I hope…you didn't break up?" She spoke up cautiously.  
销售员的脸色立刻沉了下来，她感受到了红发女子身上散发出的痛苦。作为一个见过许多情侣的人，她自信地判断出明日香的神情极度受伤，而唯一合理的解释浮现在她脑海。“你的男朋友呢？希望……你们没有分手吧？”她小心翼翼地问道。

"No. I wouldn't have come here if we did." Asuka forced herself to bring up a small smile to her face. "He's just…well…I don't know. He's there, I guess. But…"  
“不，如果我们真那样做了，我就不会来这儿了。”明日香努力挤出一个微笑。“他只是……嗯……我不知道。他就在那儿，我想。但是……”

"I'm…sorry to hear that," the salesperson said, although not really knowing what the redhead was talking about. Nonetheless, she knew the girl needed some kind of support right now. "I hope to see both of you again." _For the wedding rings._ The salesperson handed the promise rings to Asuka, who accepted with a smile.  
“听到这个我很难过，”销售员说道，尽管并不清楚红发女孩在说什么。然而，她知道此刻女孩需要某种支持。“希望还能再见到你们。”指的是婚礼戒指。销售员将承诺戒指递给明日香，她微笑着接过。

"Thanks." “谢谢。”

Misato shook her head, looking up staring at the dim yellow eyes of the giant humanoid that stood before her, which remained bolted down by massive restraints. "I…I don't believe it." The Major had to stifle a tear. After hours and hours of trying and failing, had finally managed to open up a video link to the inside of Unit 01's entry plug. She didn't even know what she wanted to see from it, however what she actually saw was beyond every single of her wildest expectations.  
Misato 摇了摇头，抬头凝视着眼前巨型人形生物昏黄的眼睛，它被巨大的束缚装置牢牢固定。"我……我不敢相信。"少校强忍住泪水。经过无数次尝试和失败，她终于成功打开了与零一单元驾驶舱内的视频链接。她甚至不知道自己想从里面看到什么，然而实际所见却超出了她最疯狂的想象。

What she saw was nothing.  
她所见之物，空无一物。

The only thing that remained of Shinji was his white and blue plugsuit, which steadily floated in the pool of LCL. Nothing else was visible, not even a mild increase of turbidity. The only assumption Dr. Akagi was able to bring up was that Shinji's sync rate had gone up so high that he became one with the EVA, and whether he could be recovered was still up in the air.  
唯一留下的只有真嗣的白色和蓝色插入栓服，它稳定地漂浮在 LCL 池中。其他什么也看不见，甚至连轻微的混浊都没有。赤木博士唯一能提出的假设是，真嗣的同步率已经上升到如此之高，以至于他与 EVA 合为一体，至于他是否能被救回，仍是未知数。

The above hypothesis did little to help soothe Asuka's anxiousness and agitation. Sitting on the floor next to the Major, the redhead sighed as she hugged her knees closer to her chest. She had been wondering what she would do once she was standing before Unit 01. It wasn't like Shinji was going to be there to hear what she had to say, but it was the closest she'd ever get at this point. Somehow she felt the concept of Shinji's soul being trapped in the core sounded strange to her, though she couldn't really come up with anything else.  
上述假设对缓解明日香的焦虑和烦躁几乎毫无帮助。坐在少校旁边的地板上，红发女孩叹了口气，将膝盖抱得更紧。她一直在想，一旦站在 01 号机前，她会做什么。真嗣不会在那里听她说话，但这是她目前能做的最接近的事。不知为何，她觉得真嗣的灵魂被困在核心中的概念听起来很奇怪，尽管她想不出别的解释。

The redhead exhaled through her mouth, slouching forward a bit. She found herself unable to figure out what she wanted to do. Did she want to simply stare in silence at the EVA, or did she want to talk to the boy inside of it? Did it really matter?  
红发女孩用嘴呼出一口气，稍微向前倾。她发现自己无法弄清楚自己想做什么。她只想默默地盯着 EVA，还是想和里面的男孩说话？这真的重要吗？

"Shinji…if you can hear me, I want you to know that I'm still keeping my promise." Asuka said, her volume becoming louder as she continued. "You were there for me, now it's my turn to be here for you."  
"真嗣…如果你能听到我的话，我想让你知道，我依然在坚守我的承诺。" 明日香说道，随着她继续说下去，声音变得越来越大。"你曾在我身边支持我，现在轮到我来支持你了。"

If he could pull her out of the influence by the Angel, then she was sure she could pull him out of…whatever it was as well.  
如果他能将她从使徒的影响中拉出来，那么她确信自己也能将他从…无论是什么东西中拉出来。

"Pilot Soryu, you're staying up really late." A stony, yet subtly strangely unfamiliar voice echoed from above her. Asuka quickly turned around and looked up at the observation spot overlooking the cages. She made out a broad silhouette leaning against the railing, his white gloves clasped onto the metal bar and his eyes hidden behind the shimmering of his glasses.  
"惣流飞行员，你熬夜太晚了。"一个沉稳但略显陌生的声音从上方传来。明日香迅速转身，抬头望向俯瞰笼子的观察点。她看到一个宽阔的身影倚靠在栏杆上，白色的手套紧握着金属杆，眼睛隐藏在闪烁的眼镜后面。

"Commander?" Asuka asked in surprise. "Excuse me…but what are you doing here?" In her impression, she had always found the Commander eerily collected, as if nothing happening around him could make him so much as raising an eyebrow.  
"指挥官？" 明日香惊讶地问道，"不好意思……但您在这里做什么？" 在她印象中，她总是发现指挥官异常镇定，仿佛周围发生的一切都无法让他动容。

"I am quite sure we both have the same idea." He replied in a calm voice, keeping his stare at Unit 01's dormant face. Though he couldn't help but feel warmth grow inside his chest – for all he knew, the Second Child should be a childish brat who cared about no one but herself. At first, he really had no idea of why Shinji was infatuated with her; he had thought it was only because of her face, but now he seemed to get more and more insight as he observed.  
"我确信我们有着相同的想法。" 他用平静的声音回答，目光始终停留在初号机沉睡的面容上。尽管他不禁感到胸中涌起一股暖意——据他所知，二号驾驶员本应是个只关心自己的幼稚小鬼。起初，他真的不明白为什么真嗣会迷恋她；他曾以为只是因为她的外表，但现在随着观察的深入，他似乎越来越明白了。

"Well, yeah, but…" Asuka sighed again, turning her head back at Unit 01. The same idea? Did Shinji's father love him as well or what? Shaking the thoughts off, Asuka continued. "I just don't know what to expect anymore."  
"嗯，是啊，但是……" 明日香再次叹息，回头望向初号机。相同的想法？难道真嗣的父亲也爱他吗？甩开这些念头，明日香继续说道，"我只是不知道还能期待什么了。"

"He will come back." Gendo Ikari rose his head to stare at the ceiling. "If anything, I believe that he will come back for you." With that, the Commander of NERV turned around and left Asuka's field of view.  
“他会回来的。”碇源堂抬起头，凝视着天花板。“如果有谁会回来，我相信他会为了你而回来。”说完，NERV 的指挥官转过身，离开了明日香的视线。

The redhead found herself at a loss for words. No matter how strange it felt to hear those words coming out of the person she least expected to hear from, they still told the truth. "Of course he will come back for me," Asuka muttered to herself. "He promised. If he ever dares to break that promise, I'll destroy Unit 01 myself."  
红发少女发现自己无言以对。无论从她最意想不到的人口中听到这些话有多奇怪，它们依然道出了真相。“他当然会回来找我，”明日香喃喃自语，“他承诺过。如果他胆敢违背那个承诺，我会亲自毁掉初号机。”

Sighing again as she saw no reactions whatsoever from the EVA, Asuka took out the promise ring she brought back from the store. "Shinji, here's the deal." Slowly, she raised her hand with a sad smile, the ring that had her name on it on her ring finger. "It looks beautiful, really. But I want you to see it by yourself. After all, it's you who made this meaningful."  
再次叹息，因为她没有从 EVA 那里得到任何反应，明日香拿出了从店里带回的承诺戒指。“真嗣，听好了。”她缓缓举起手，带着悲伤的微笑，那枚刻有她名字的戒指戴在她的无名指上。“它看起来很美，真的。但我想让你亲眼看到。毕竟，是你的存在赋予了它意义。”

Suddenly another idea flashed into her mind. She took out a silk string and put it through the ring that had Shinji's name on it before wrapping the string around her neck and putting the ring between her breasts. "I don't think this ring is coming out of here. The only way to take it out is by your own hands." She took a deep breath and closed her single eye. "If, I mean if, you aren't coming out ever again, I'll keep this here forever. If people ask questions about it, they'll just have to deal with it. It's not like I care about their opinions anymore."  
突然，另一个念头闪过她的脑海。她拿出一条丝线，穿过刻有真嗣名字的戒指，然后将丝线绕在脖子上，把戒指放在胸前。“我想这枚戒指是不会从这里取出来的。唯一能取下它的方式，只能是你亲手。”她深吸一口气，闭上了那只眼睛。“如果，我是说如果，你再也不出来了，我会永远把它留在这里。如果有人问起，他们只能接受。我不再在乎他们的看法了。”

"You hear that, Stupid Shinji?" Asuka had to hold back a sob. "You can't just leave me alone. I'll never forgive you."  
“你听到了吗，笨蛋真嗣？”明日香强忍着哽咽。“你不能就这样丢下我一个人。我永远不会原谅你。”

Misato watched the whole scene in silence since she wanted to give the lonely girl some space. Though it was getting real late, and apparently, Asuka hadn't slept for a long time. Letting out a sigh, she came up next to her and put a hand on her shoulder. "We're doing our best, Asuka." Her voice was tender and soothing. "I know what he means to you."  
美里默默地看着这一切，她想给这个孤独的女孩一些空间。虽然时间已经很晚了，显然，明日香已经很久没有睡觉了。她叹了口气，走到她身边，把手放在她的肩膀上。“我们正在尽全力，明日香。”她的声音温柔而抚慰。“我知道他对你意味着什么。”

"Do you, really?" Asuka spoke up with an unusual sharpness in her tone. "You don't even know one percent of how much…how much I love him."  
"你，真的吗？" 明日香语气中带着不寻常的尖锐说道，"你连我有多爱他的一百分之一都不了解。"

Misato sighed again. Perhaps Asuka was right. She wasn't really paying attention to them lately; in her eyes, Asuka and Shinji were girlfriend and boyfriends and combat partners, and that's it. Was there something deeper between the two? "I promise we're going to get him out. But it's late, and you need some rest. It's been twenty hours since your last sleep."  
美里再次叹了口气。或许明日香是对的。她最近确实没怎么关注他们；在她眼里，明日香和真嗣只是男女朋友和战斗伙伴，仅此而已。他们之间是否还有更深的情感？"我保证我们会把他救出来的。但现在已经很晚了，你需要休息。你已经二十个小时没睡觉了。"

"I…" Asuka smiled a sad smile. "Misato…maybe this sounds hilarious…but I don't think I can fall asleep without him anymore."  
"我…" 明日香苦笑了一下，"美里…这听起来可能很可笑…但我现在觉得没有他在身边，我无法入睡了。"

Misato raised her eyebrows. "Still… it's getting cold down here. You really need to go home and get some rest. I'll tell you when we are going to make another attempt, okay?"  
美里挑了挑眉。“还是……这里越来越冷了。你真的需要回家好好休息。我们什么时候再尝试，我会告诉你的，好吗？”

"But…" "但是…"

"Asuka, it's not like you can do anything here." Misato's voice gained a note of firmness. "And if Shinji could see you right now, I don't think he would be happy to see you like this."  
“明日香，你在这里也做不了什么。”美里的声音变得坚定。“如果真嗣现在能看到你，我想他不会高兴看到你这样的。”

Asuka sighed in defeat. "Fine…but you have to promise you'll tell me as soon as the time is set!"  
明日香无奈地叹了口气。“好吧……但你得答应我，一确定时间就马上告诉我！”

Misato nodded. "I promise."  
美里点头。“我保证。”

Asuka buried her face in her pillow as she continued to sulk. No progress had been made for the past few days in retrieving Shinji from the LCL in his entry plug. She wasn't aware of the technical details, but the fact that he still hadn't come back to her was ripping her heart apart.  
明日香把脸埋在枕头里，继续生闷气。过去几天里，从插入栓的 LCL 中找回真嗣的进展毫无起色。她并不了解技术细节，但真嗣仍未回到她身边这一事实，正撕裂着她的心。

Everything had been shit ever since Shinji disappeared into the LCL. No one was there to hold her during the days and the nights. Nightmares were starting to resurface, and instead of the usual mother and doll, the contents were replaced by seeing Shinji die in various ways, destroying her already fragile mind.  
自从真嗣消失在 LCL 中后，一切都变得糟糕透顶。白天和夜晚再也没有人抱着她。噩梦开始重现，不再是通常的母亲和玩偶，内容变成了目睹真嗣以各种方式死去，摧毁了她本已脆弱的心灵。

Slowly, Asuka raised her head from the pillow. Her right eye was puffy, her chin was a bit swollen, not to mention her messy hair, still somewhat holding in place only because of the eyepatch. "The bed… it's so cold…" She mumbled to herself.  
慢慢地，明日香从枕头上抬起头。她的右眼肿胀，下巴有些肿起，更不用说她那凌乱的头发，还勉强固定在原位只是因为眼罩。“床……好冷……”她喃喃自语。

Asuka got up from the bed, her attention immediately caught by the portrait Shinji drew for her. Chuckling, she picked it up with utmost care and rolled it up, putting the paint into the safest level of her wardrobe. It was the testimony of their love, the epitome of their bond.  
明日香从床上起身，立刻被真嗣为她画的肖像吸引。她轻笑一声，小心翼翼地拿起画卷，将其卷好，放入衣柜中最安全的隔层。这是他们爱情的见证，是他们情感纽带的缩影。

Misato hadn't come home yet, apparently engulfed in the sea of paper works. Asuka had to order take-outs or cook by herself. It was then she again confirmed how much she had missed Shinji's cooking.  
美里还没回家，显然是被文件的海洋吞没了。明日香不得不点外卖或自己做饭。这时她再次确认了自己有多么怀念真嗣的厨艺。

_Beep_

Hearing the notification sound, Asuka took out her phone and pulled the new message up. It was Misato telling her that NERV would try to bring Shinji out of there again today, with the scheduled time at the bottom.  
听到提示音，明日香掏出手机，打开了新消息。是美里发来的，告诉她 NERV 今天将再次尝试将真嗣带出来，预定时间附在消息底部。

Asuka let out a long sorrowful sigh as she shoved the phone in her pocket. Suddenly her face lit up a bit as she recalled the methods Shinji used to bring her back from the influence of the Angel. Maybe she could bring some stuff he was familiar with and see if they could work.  
明日香叹了口气，将手机塞回口袋。突然，她的脸上闪过一丝希望，想起了真嗣曾用过的方法，将她从使徒的影响中拉回。或许她可以带些他熟悉的东西，看看是否能奏效。

Asuka rushed into Shinji's closet and started searching around. After picking up several objects she didn't even know he possessed, her eye finally rested on the small black box placed on the table.  
明日香冲进真嗣的衣柜，开始四处翻找。在拿起几件她甚至不知道他拥有的物品后，她的目光最终落在了桌上的那个小黑盒上。

Frowning, Asuka walked closer to the table and picked up the small box. After a careful examination, she could recognize it as an SDAT player, an old version on top of all.  
皱着眉头，明日香走近桌子，拿起那个小盒子。经过仔细检查，她认出这是一个 SDAT 播放器，而且还是个旧版本。

What intrigued her was the fact that she had never seen him listening to it ever before, however, from the looks of it – cleaned and dustless – someone had used it just recently. The only possibility was Shinji since no one had even entered the small closet other than she and Shinji.  
让她感到好奇的是，她从未见过他之前听过这个，但从外观上看——干净无尘——显然最近有人使用过。唯一的可能性就是真嗣，因为除了她和真嗣，没有人进过那个小储藏室。

Curiosity suddenly crept up in her chest, temporarily flushing away some of her anxiety and loneliness. She was curious to listen to what kind of songs Shinji would listen to. Asuka picked up the earbuds and inserted them in her ears, and pressed the PLAY button.  
好奇心突然涌上心头，暂时冲淡了她的焦虑和孤独感。她很好奇真嗣会听什么样的歌曲。明日香拿起耳机，塞进耳朵，按下了播放键。

The black face of Evangelion Unit 03 stared vacantly at Kaworu as he made his way across the catwalk. Each step he took echoed throughout the cages until he finally came to a stop in front of the EVA. Letting out a sigh, Kaworu knew that this had to be done. It was something he had been postponing for a long time now, and couldn't ignore for any longer. Now that Unit 01 was inoperational, this would be his best chance.  
福音战士 03 号机的黑色面孔空洞地盯着卡洛一步步穿过天桥。他的每一步都回荡在笼子里，直到他终于在 EVA 前停下。卡洛叹了口气，他知道这必须完成。这是他长期以来一直在拖延的事情，不能再忽视了。既然 01 号机无法操作，这将是他最好的机会。

"Come on, Let's go," Kaworu said, looking directly at the EVA. "Come with me, Adam's alter ego, servant of the Lil-"  
“来吧，我们走，”卡洛直视着 EVA 说道，“跟我来，亚当的化身，莉莉丝的仆从……”

"Hey! Pretty boy!" “嘿！帅哥！”

Kaworu retracted his left foot, which was already half in the air, and turned his head to the direction of the voice with a puzzled expression. Seconds later, a redhead came into his line of sight, walking toward him in delicate steps. "Yes, Pilot Soryu?"  
渚薰收回了他悬在半空的左脚，带着困惑的表情转向声音的方向。几秒钟后，一位红发少女映入他的视线，她优雅地向他走来。“是的，绫波零驾驶员？”

"I have a few things to discuss with you. This place ain't safe." Asuka said with an unreadable expression even to Kaworu. "Come with me."  
“我有几件事要和你讨论。这里不安全。”明日香带着连渚薰都无法解读的表情说道，“跟我来。”

Kaworu only hesitated for a short moment before sighing in resignation. It wasn't like a human like the Second Child could post any threat to him, and he could wait for a little longer, just to see what she had on her mind.  
渚薰只犹豫了片刻，便叹了口气表示妥协。像二号机驾驶员这样的人类对他构不成任何威胁，他可以再等一会儿，看看她到底有什么想法。

Following the Second Child into a small office, Kaworu shut the door close after they both entered the room. "Okay, we don't have bugs here." Asuka checked. "You said you can bring me to my mother if I help you, right?"  
"跟着第二适任者走进一间小办公室，渚薰在他们两人进入房间后关上了门。“好了，这里没有窃听器。”明日香检查了一番。“你说如果我帮你，就能带我去见我母亲，对吧？””

Kaworu raised an eyebrow. It was merely a lie developed to attack from the Second Child's weak point, nothing more. Though it didn't really matter at the moment. "Of course. Did you change your mind?"  
"渚薰挑了挑眉。那不过是为了从第二适任者的弱点入手而编造的谎言，仅此而已。不过眼下这并不重要。“当然。你改变主意了吗？””

"Yeah, actually…" Asuka pondered for a moment. "I need to wait until my EVA gets repaired, like in five days at most. Can you come and see my next sync test? We can discuss the details after that, alright?"  
““嗯，实际上……”明日香沉思片刻。“我需要等到我的 EVA 修好，最多五天。你能来看我下次的同步测试吗？之后我们可以讨论细节，好吗？””

Kaworu forced down a surprised expression, still maintaining his usual nonchalant smirk. Such change of plans would indeed postpone his reunion with Adam, but if he could have Unit 02 and the Second Child at his side, at least he could fight off Unit 00 easily.  
渚薰强压下惊讶的表情，依旧保持着他惯有的漫不经心的微笑。这样的计划变动确实会推迟他与亚当的会面，但如果他能拥有零二号机和第二适格者在他身边，至少他可以轻易击退零号机。

It was a worthy trade for him.  
对他来说，这是一笔值得的交易。

"Of course. Anything you like."  
“当然，你喜欢什么都行。”

"Good." Asuka brought up the sweetest smile she could at the moment. "Wait for me. We can have a lot of _fun_ after my sync test."  
"好。" 明日香尽力展露出此刻最甜美的笑容。"等我一下。同步测试后我们可以好好玩一玩。"

"I'm looking forward to it, Pilot Soryu." Kaworu's smirk grew wider.  
"我很期待，惣流·兰格雷驾驶员。" 渚薰的微笑更深了。

"Just…call me Asuka, alright?"  
"就…叫我明日香，好吗？"

"Sure, then I guess you can just call me Kaworu, then."  
“当然，那我想你可以直接叫我薰。”

Asuka nodded. "See you later…Kaworu." With that, she turned around and left the small office.  
明日香点点头。“再见……薰。”说完，她转身离开了小办公室。

Kaworu kept his gaze at her backside until she disappeared behind the closing door. He couldn't help but make his smirk into a grin.  
薰一直注视着她的背影，直到她消失在缓缓关闭的门后。他忍不住将微笑扩大成一个咧嘴笑。

After all, Lilim are easy to manipulate.  
毕竟，莉莉姆很容易操控。

这一章也将被评定为 M 级，特此告知。

**Chapter 38: Interlude IV: What I Wanted  
第 38 章：间奏 IV：我所渴望的**

Slowly my eyes fluttered open, just to see strands of red hair that threatened to get into my face, tickling my nose as I breathed. How did I end up like this? I felt like I was used to waking up like this, but somehow everything felt off by a notch.  
慢慢地，我的眼睛微微睁开，只见到几缕红发似乎要侵入我的脸庞，随着呼吸轻轻挠着我的鼻子。我是怎么变成这样的？我感觉自己已经习惯了这样醒来，但不知为何，一切都感觉差了一点点。

"Rise and shine…darling." A familiar, yet unfamiliar voice came to me. The person lying beside me yawned and stretched her limbs, rubbing her eyes. "Gott, last night you were amazing."  
“起床了……亲爱的。”一个熟悉又陌生的声音传来。躺在我身旁的人打了个哈欠，伸了伸懒腰，揉着眼睛。“天啊，昨晚你真是太棒了。”

Last night? I tried to recall what had happened last night, but everything I remember was a blur. All I knew was that the possessor of the red hair was called Asuka Langley Soryu, someone I loved. "Anything for you, Asuka-dear."  
昨晚？我试图回忆昨晚发生了什么，但能记起的只是一片模糊。我只知道那个红发女孩名叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷，是我深爱的人。“为了你，明日香，我什么都愿意。”

"Now get up and make me breakfast." I heard her mumble as she rose from the bed. "Or I could eat something else, you know." A mischievous grin crossed her beautiful face.  
“现在起床给我做早餐。”我听到她嘟囔着从床上起身。“或者我可以吃点别的，你知道的。”一个调皮的笑容在她美丽的脸上绽放。

Wait. Her face didn't exactly feel right to me. Don't get me wrong, she's still divine, breathtaking as she always was. Though…she looked older? More mature?  
等等。她的脸给我的感觉不太对劲。别误会，她依然美丽动人，一如既往地令人屏息。不过……她看起来更成熟了？更有韵味了？

I didn't know how those words reached me. Shaking the thoughts off, I got up from the bed as well. "I think you really drained me last night," I said as I felt my body sore. "Now, if you excuse me… I'll go start cooking."  
我不知道那些话是如何传到我耳中的。甩开这些思绪，我也从床上起身。“我想你昨晚真的把我累坏了，”我感到身体酸痛地说道，“现在，如果你不介意的话……我要去开始做饭了。”

"Hmph, no fun," Asuka grumbled. "Stupid Shinji, stupid as always."  
“哼，真没意思，”明日香嘟囔着，“笨蛋真嗣，一如既往的笨。”

I chuckled and stood up, feeling the coldness of the floor under my feet. I left the bedroom and entered the bathroom to take a look at myself. Unsurprisingly, the words reached my head again as I took a careful examination of my appearance. Something felt off, but I couldn't put my fingers on it.  
我轻笑一声，站起身来，感受到脚下地板的冰凉。我离开卧室，走进浴室，仔细打量自己。不出所料，那些话再次在我脑海中响起。有些不对劲，但我又说不上来具体是什么。

Speaking of my fingers… there's something around my ring finger…  
说到我的手指……我的无名指上似乎有什么东西……

A wedding ring. 一枚婚戒。

My eyes went wide as the realization dawned on me. I tried to take it off and see who I was married with, but I couldn't since it stuck rather firmly on my finger. Though I let panic go soon, since I could very well guess who my wife was.  
我瞪大了眼睛，意识到这一点时心中一惊。我试图摘下戒指看看我与谁结了婚，但戒指牢牢地卡在手指上，无法取下。不过我很快平复了慌乱，因为我大致能猜到我的妻子是谁。

I shook my head and started my morning routine. This wasn't so bad. In fact, this was what I've always wanted, wasn't it? To be together with Asuka. I finally got rid of the curse, didn't I? No EVAs anymore. The world was saved, and I could spend the rest of my life with the person I loved. Even though I didn't even remember how I got here.  
我摇了摇头，开始了早晨的例行公事。这并不算糟糕。事实上，这正是我一直渴望的，不是吗？与明日香在一起。我终于摆脱了诅咒，不是吗？不再有 EVA 了。世界得救了，我可以与我爱的人共度余生。尽管我甚至不记得我是怎么来到这里的。

Was it all a dream? For some reason, the EVAs, the Angels…they all seemed somewhat distant to me, as if they'd never existed in the first place.  
这一切都是梦吗？不知为何，EVA、使徒……它们对我来说都显得有些遥远，仿佛它们从未存在过一样。

_**"…ji!" ……酱！**_

I snapped my head around, but saw nothing, save for the white patterned bathroom wall. Great. Now I am hearing things. The Angel Wars really did a number on my mind.  
我猛地转过头，却只看到那白色图案的浴室墙。太好了，现在我居然开始幻听了。天使战争真是把我的脑子搞得一团糟。

After finishing washing myself, I walked into the kitchen area and prepared to start making breakfast, just to see Asuka, who was basically wearing nothing but underwear and an apron, standing in front of the stove, her hands working on the pots and pans.  
洗漱完毕后，我走进厨房准备做早餐，却看到明日香，几乎只穿着内衣和围裙，站在炉子前，双手忙碌地摆弄着锅碗瓢盆。

Her body was different from what I remembered as well, though in a good way. I couldn't take off my eyes on her well-sculptured body.  
她的身材也与我记忆中的不同，不过是以一种好的方式。我无法将目光从她那雕塑般完美的身体上移开。

She must've noticed my presence as she turned around with a smile. "Shinji, what do you want for breakfast?" She chuckled as she received no response from me after a few seconds. "Idiot, you're staring again. I know I'm attractive, but after so many times we've had sex, you still couldn't resist me."  
她一定察觉到了我的存在，转过身来微笑着问：“真嗣，早餐想吃什么？”她轻笑一声，几秒钟后我仍未回应，她便打趣道：“傻瓜，又在发呆了。我知道我很迷人，但我们都那么多次了，你还抵挡不住我吗？”

"I just like to behold perfection." I blinked, quickly picking up a line suitable to say under such a situation and feeling my cheeks start to heat up.  
“我只是喜欢欣赏完美。”我眨了眨眼，迅速找到一句适合在这种场合说的话，同时感到脸颊开始发热。

"Yeah, I know." Asuka shoved her hair behind her ears. "You still haven't answered my question. What do you want for breakfast?"  
“是啊，我知道。”明日香将头发撩到耳后，“你还没回答我的问题呢。早餐想吃什么？”

"Toasts and bacon," I replied without thinking. "I thought you said I was the one making breakfast?"  
"吐司和培根，" 我不假思索地回答，"我以为你说是我来做早餐？"

"You were taking so long in the bathroom," Asuka replied. "You weren't getting off in there, were you? While having me available at your hand?" She pouted.  
"你在浴室里待那么久，" 明日香回答道，"你不会是在里面自娱自乐吧？明明我就在你手边？" 她噘起了嘴。

"No, of course not." I raised an eyebrow. From what I could remember, Asuka never _actively_ made breakfast for me. Something wasn't right. "Need a hand?"  
"当然没有。" 我挑了挑眉。就我所记得的，明日香从未主动为我做过早餐。有些不对劲。"需要帮忙吗？"

"I'll be fine. Though if you want to help, you can bring me some milk from the fridge."  
"我会没事的。不过如果你想帮忙，可以帮我从冰箱里拿些牛奶。"

"I'm on it," I said as I walked to the refrigerator, shaking my head as I tried to clear my mind. What's up with me this morning? It felt like I had a hungover last night and forgot some important stuff.  
"我这就去，" 我说着走向冰箱，摇着头试图理清思绪。今天早上我这是怎么了？感觉像是昨晚宿醉了，还忘了些重要的事情。

"We're going to Suzuhara's place today. So we may have to buy some gifts." I heard Asuka say as I walked back to the dining table.  
"我们今天要去铃原家。所以可能得买些礼物。" 我听到明日香说，同时我走回餐桌。

"Suzuhara? Toji?" I inquired. "What for?"  
"铃原？冬二？" 我问道，"为什么？"

I saw Asuka's palm mt her face. "Stupid Shinji. You couldn't seriously forget about Miya's first birthday, can you?"  
我看到明日香用手掌拍了拍额头。"笨蛋真嗣。你不会真的忘了美也的第一个生日吧？"

Miya…Suzuhara, I blinked as the name registered in my mind out of nowhere. "Oh, right. Hikari and Toji's daughter."  
美也……铃原，我眨了眨眼，这个名字突然在脑海中浮现。"哦，对了。光和冬二的女儿。"

"Damn right." Asuka huffed. "Say, when do you want a kid, Shinji? Should we plan it? I mean…I never thought about it when I was young, but now we're in our twenties, maybe we should…"  
“当然没错。”明日香哼了一声，“话说回来，真嗣，你什么时候想要孩子？我们要不要计划一下？我是说……年轻时我从没想过这些，但现在我们都二十多岁了，或许应该……”

My eyes went wide. It didn't feel like something Asuka would bring up herself. And…twenties? "I'm still thinking about it." Giving a non-committal answer, I rushed to look at the calendar.  
我瞪大了眼睛。这不像明日香会自己提出来的话题。而且……二十多岁？“我还在考虑。”我含糊其辞地回答，急忙看向日历。

_2024. 12. 20_

Alright, something was definitely wrong. How come 9 years of memory just gone I had no idea. But I didn't want to find out, did I? I'm living the life I wanted with the person I loved, and I intend to live this life as long as possible.  
好吧，肯定有什么地方不对劲。九年的记忆怎么就消失了，我毫无头绪。但我不想去探究，不是吗？我和我爱的人过着想要的生活，我打算尽可能长久地过这样的生活。

It's not like I'm leaving anyone behind, right?  
我又不是要抛下谁，对吧？

After finishing having breakfast, Asuka and I left the apartment. I took a look at the city with my eyes gleamed in surprise. The apartment complex we were residing in was 20-floor high, surrounded by several other buildings about the same height as well as hordes of villas. In the distance, I could see a crowd of skyscrapers standing out from the ground, the glass walls glowed under the blazing sunshine.  
吃完早餐后，我和明日香离开了公寓。我惊讶地睁大了眼睛，环顾这座城市。我们居住的公寓楼有 20 层高，周围环绕着几座同样高度的建筑以及成群的别墅。远处，一排排摩天大楼拔地而起，在炽热的阳光下，玻璃幕墙闪闪发光。

Everything was lively and energetic without a slight trace of disaster.  
一切都是那么生机勃勃，没有丝毫灾难的痕迹。

We walked to the train station just near our home hand in hand. A glance at the timetable told me we were living in Hakone, a name I've heard of numerous times before but couldn't really remember the significance of it.  
我们手牵手走到离家不远的火车站。看了一眼时刻表，我意识到我们住在箱根，这个名字我之前听过无数次，但具体意义却记不清了。

"What's gotten into you today?" Asuka's quizzical voice snapped me back to reality. "You're spacing out a lot. Is there something wrong?"  
"你今天怎么了？" 明日香疑惑的声音将我拉回现实。"你一直在走神。是不是有什么事？"

"No, nothing is wrong." I lied, still trying to figure out things by myself. "Maybe the hungover is just bad, that's all."  
"没有，没什么事。" 我撒了个谎，仍在试图自己理清思绪。"可能只是宿醉太严重了，仅此而已。"

"Right. You did drink a lot last night." Asuka chuckled. "You fell asleep when I asked you to do a second round. Hmph."  
“对。你昨晚确实喝了不少。” 明日香轻笑道，“我让你再来一轮时，你就睡着了。哼。”

"Well, I'm surely gonna make it up to you tonight," I replied with a smile, eliciting a smirk from her. Though it was like I knew what I was going to say, almost like on autopilot. My brain was still adjusting…as if trying to make me forget about some things.  
“好吧，今晚我一定会补偿你的，”我笑着回答，引得她嘴角上扬。虽然这话说得像是条件反射，我的大脑仍在适应……仿佛试图让我忘记某些事情。

What did I forget about?  
我忘了什么？

For some unspoken reason, I felt everything around me was getting increasingly more normal to me, as if things were just like how they should be. It was, wasn't it? Angels, EVAs, NERV, SEELE…they all seemed distant, surreal to me. Perhaps I just had a horrible dream?  
出于某种未言明的原因，我感到周围的一切对我来说变得越来越正常，仿佛事情本该如此。难道不是吗？天使、EVA、NERV、SEELE……它们对我来说都显得遥远而不真实。或许我只是做了一个可怕的梦？

Looking at the smiling redhead sitting beside me, I smiled back and leaned in for a kiss.  
看着坐在我身边微笑的红发女孩，我也回以微笑，并倾身过去亲吻她。

_**"…promised!" “……承诺了！”**_

I instinctively drew back before our lips even made contact, eliciting a confused look from Asuka. What was that voice? It sounded concerningly familiar…  
我本能地退缩，甚至在我们的嘴唇接触之前，这让明日香露出了困惑的表情。那个声音是什么？听起来令人不安地熟悉……

"What's wrong Shinji?" Asuka inquired, her voice hurt. "You…you are very different today." She pulled away from me. "Is…is there someone else? Please tell me, Shinji!"  
“怎么了，真嗣？”明日香问道，她的声音带着受伤。“你……你今天很不一样。”她从我身边拉开距离。“是……是不是有别人了？请告诉我，真嗣！”

Someone else? Of course not. People say your heart grows more distant when you stay with one person for too long, but it's not the case for me at all. After everything I've been through…after everything _we've_ been through, I don't think I can even _imagine_ being anyone else now. "No Asuka, there's no other person. Remember, I'm always yours."  
别人？当然没有。人们说当你和一个人在一起太久，心会变得疏远，但这对我来说完全不是这样。经历了这么多……经历了我们共同经历的一切，我想我现在甚至无法想象成为别人。“不，明日香，没有其他人。记住，我永远属于你。”

"…Alright. Stay together with me, Shinji." I heard her let out a small sigh of relief and leaned her head on my shoulder as I relished in her mesmerizing body scent and intoxicating warmth. I wanted to stay there forever and forget about everything-  
“……好吧。和我待在一起，真嗣。” 我听到她松了一口气，轻轻叹息，然后将头靠在我的肩上。我沉醉在她迷人的体香和令人陶醉的温暖中，希望能永远留在那里，忘却一切——

I violently shook my head. The last line of thought didn't come from myself. "Are you okay Shinji?" Asuka asked again, her voice concerned.  
我猛烈地摇了摇头。最后的念头并非出自我自己。“你还好吗，真嗣？” 明日香再次问道，声音中带着关切。

"Just a mild headache," I replied. It was technically the truth – ever since I woke up today, my mind was struggling with something. Like it was trying to inject a lot of things, while at the same time taking away more.  
“只是有点轻微的头痛，”我回答道。这确实是事实——自从今天醒来后，我的头脑一直在努力应对某些事情。就像是在试图注入许多东西，同时又夺走更多。

"Dear passengers, we're approaching station…"  
“亲爱的乘客们，我们即将到达……”

"We're here. Let's go." Asuka stood up from her seat and dragged me along. Well, at least some things never change…  
“我们到了。走吧。”明日香从座位上站起来，拉着我一起走。好吧，至少有些事情永远不会改变……

The outside was sunny but cold, just a typical day in winter Japan. Both of our wedding rings shined as we walked together holding hands. Somehow the sight of leafless trees and people wearing thick coats looked odd to me as if I'd never seen it before, but the logical part of my brain was telling me nothing wrong. The sense of conflict was driving me nuts.  
外面阳光明媚却寒冷，正是日本冬日的典型天气。我们手牵手一起走，两人的结婚戒指闪闪发光。不知为何，光秃秃的树木和穿着厚外套的人们在我看来显得很奇怪，仿佛我从未见过这样的景象，但理智告诉我一切正常。这种矛盾的感觉让我快要疯了。

We came to a stop in front of a gift shop for newborns. The various infant products dazzled me. Come to think of it, I wasn't really prepared for having kids, but if Asuka wanted it, I would definitely do my best.  
我们在一家新生儿礼品店前停下。各式各样的婴儿用品让我眼花缭乱。仔细想想，我其实并没有为育儿做好准备，但如果明日香想要，我一定会尽全力。

Not long after Asuka finished choosing the presents. She bought a pair of golden locks, though I doubt they were solid. Where did we get so much money from, anyway? If we had never been EVA pilots, we shouldn't have so much money. Though it wasn't my place to question it, was it? Everything around me was perfect.  
明日香不久就选好了礼物。她买了一对金锁，虽然我怀疑它们是否纯金。我们哪来这么多钱呢？如果不是因为曾是 EVA 驾驶员，我们不应该有这么多钱。虽然这不是我该质疑的，对吧？我周围的一切都完美无缺。

"Hello, Shinji, Asuka! Welcome!" Hikari appeared from behind the electronic door after three times of bell ringing. After exchanging greetings, we entered the Suzuhara residence. A peek inside the bedroom nearly brought a wave of uncontrollable laughter from me. Toji was clearly struggling to handle his kid as the baby thrashed and turned in his arms, while he was trying his best to make the baby stop crying.  
“你好，真嗣，明日香！欢迎！”电子门铃响了三次后，光从门后出现。互相问候后，我们进入了铃原家。瞥了一眼卧室，差点让我忍不住大笑。铃原显然在努力应对他的孩子，婴儿在他怀里扭动翻腾，而他正尽力让婴儿停止哭泣。

A smile crossed my face. Even my friends were having their lives. This was what I've always wanted, aside from making Asuka happy. I could stay here forever-  
一丝微笑掠过我的脸庞。即使我的朋友们也在过着自己的生活。这正是我一直想要的，除了让明日香开心之外。我可以永远留在这里——

_**"…back!" “……回来！”**_

I blinked. The world seemed to distort for a short moment. Damn, what's wrong with me today? I started worrying about myself. I'm hearing things and having horrible hallucinations. I watched Asuka and Hikari laughing together as they talked about how to raise a child properly. Though their conversation became blurred as time seemed to speed up.  
我眨了眨眼。世界似乎在那一刻扭曲了一瞬。该死，今天我到底怎么了？我开始担心起自己来。我听到声音，还出现了可怕的幻觉。我看着明日香和光一起笑着讨论如何正确抚养孩子。尽管她们的对话随着时间似乎加速而变得模糊。

I closed my eyes and shook my head violently again.  
我闭上眼睛，再次猛烈地摇了摇头。

Suddenly Asuka's voice reached me. "Hey Shinji, do you want kids? I don't know about this either... it's confusing at this point what we want to do. But I'm happy when I'm with you. We've always been happy together. So...if having a kid would make us even happier, I think we should."  
突然，明日香的声音传入我耳中。“嘿，真嗣，你想要孩子吗？我也不太清楚……现在我们想要做什么都变得很混乱。但和你在一起时我很快乐。我们一直都很快乐。所以……如果有个孩子能让我们更幸福，我想我们应该要。”

Asuka smiled slightly at that, while I grinned back, holding her close to me.  
明日香听到这话微微一笑，而我则咧嘴笑着，紧紧抱住她。

"Hey Shinji," said Asuka.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 明日香说道。

"Yes?" I looked into her eyes.  
“是吗？”我凝视着她的眼睛。

"I love you..." "我爱你..."

My reply came immediately. "Asuka...I too, I-"  
我的回答立刻脱口而出。“明日香……我也，我——”

...I what? ...我什么？

I love her, of course. But there was something off…  
我当然爱她。但总感觉有些不对劲……

"Shinji?" asked Asuka as she looked up at me.  
"真嗣？" 明日香抬头看着我问道。

I took a deep breath. "Sorry, Asuka, I-"  
我深吸了一口气。"对不起，明日香，我——"

"Jeez, you're supposed to say I love you too." Asuka pouted.  
"真是的，你应该说我也爱你。" 明日香噘嘴道。

"Sorry..." “对不起……”

"You're apologizing too much today. I've never seen you say sorry so much." Asuka giggled, putting her chin on my shoulder.  
"你今天道歉太多了。我从没见过你说对不起这么多次。" 明日香咯咯笑着，把下巴搁在我的肩膀上。

I was bewildered by her actions. The Asuka I knew would be angry to hear me apologize, but why did she just take it and act as if nothing happened?  
我对她的举动感到困惑。我认识的明日香听到我道歉会生气，但她为什么就这样接受了，好像什么都没发生过一样？

XXXXXX

We went home together after a long shopping trip, which Asuka took full advantage of and brought a lot of stuff home, including strawberry-scented condoms. She always preferred strawberry-flavored everything, such as shampoo. One thing I liked about her is the smell she carried, along with all the other amazing qualities.  
长时间的购物之旅后，我们一起回家，明日香充分利用了这次机会，带回了很多东西，包括草莓味的避孕套。她总是偏爱草莓味的一切，比如洗发水。我喜欢她的一点是她身上散发出的香味，以及其他所有令人赞叹的品质。

After both of us had taken the shower, from her behaviors I knew she was ready for more intimate things. Asuka never beat around the bush when it comes to having sex with me. After all, she knows I love her, and she loves me as well. Only in this way, she didn't need to hold back or be shy anymore. Not long after we were running our hands through each other's bodies. We looked into each other's eyes, her sapphire orbs sparkled as always.  
两人都洗完澡后，从她的举止中我知道她已准备好更亲密的事。对于和我发生关系，明日香从不拐弯抹角。毕竟，她知道我爱她，她也爱我。正因如此，她无需再克制或害羞。不久后，我们便开始在彼此的身体上游走。我们凝视着对方的眼睛，她那蓝宝石般的眼眸一如既往地闪烁着光芒。

"What are you waiting for? Kiss me," Asuka pouted.  
“你还在等什么？吻我。”明日香噘嘴道。

Why would I deny such an innocent request from her? I chuckled internally and shook the thoughts off. Smiling, I leaned closer and puckered my lips.  
我怎会拒绝她如此纯真的请求？我暗自发笑，甩开杂念。微笑着，我倾身向前，撅起了嘴唇。

**_"...love him!" "...爱他！"_**

I blinked and instantly drew back.  
我眨了眨眼，立刻退缩了。

Blinking again, I seemed to...remember something...from long ago?  
再次眨眼，我似乎...记起了什么...很久以前的事？

No, it had always been happening, repeating...it happened recently, and that's precisely why I couldn't remember it. But do I really have to remember it? After all, Asuka's here with me, living the life I've always wanted. Do I really need to think about anything else?  
不，这一切一直在发生，重复着...最近又发生了，而这正是我记不起来的原因。但我真的需要记住吗？毕竟，明日香在这里和我在一起，过着我一直向往的生活。我真的还需要考虑其他事情吗？

But is this _my_ Asuka?  
但这是我的明日香吗？

"Asuka?" I wondered out loud. "What is this?"  
“明日香？”我大声疑惑道，“这是怎么回事？”

"Shinji, what's wrong?" Asked Asuka in front of me. "Shinji? What's going on? Shinji!"  
"真嗣，怎么了？" 在我面前的明日香问道。"真嗣？发生了什么？真嗣！"

I looked down at Asuka in front of me with a strange expression, which was mirrored by her. "Who are you?"  
我带着奇怪的表情低头看着我面前的明日香，她的脸上也映出了同样的表情。"你是谁？"

"I'm Asuka!" She yelled out loud, looking at me with a pained face. "Your partner, lover, and wife! Shinji, what's going on?"  
"我是明日香！" 她大声喊道，痛苦地看着我。"你的搭档、爱人和妻子！真嗣，到底怎么了？"

Perhaps she was right... 也许她是对的……

But I need to make sure of it first.  
但我得先确认一下。

I turned around and began walking away from her.  
我转过身，开始远离她走去。

"Where are you going?" I could hear Asuka shouting behind me. "You promised to never leave me!"  
"你要去哪儿？" 我听到背后明日香在喊，"你答应过永远不会离开我的！"

I turned around and saw that she was crying.  
我转过身，看到她在哭泣。

"I'm sorry," I mumbled. "But I didn't make the promise to you. You're not my Asuka. I need to…I need to remember."  
"对不起，" 我咕哝着，"但我不是对你许下的承诺。你不是我的明日香。我需要……我需要记起来。"

But could I…I can't… 但我能...我不能...

"Don't leave me Shinji!" I saw Asuka fell down to the ground with her face covered in tears. "I love you! Don't go! Please!"  
"别离开我，真嗣！" 我看到明日香跌坐在地上，泪流满面。"我爱你！别走！求你了！"

I felt my heart being ripped apart as I saw her like this. After all, she was Asuka.  
看到她这副模样，我感到心如刀割。毕竟，她是明日香。

Or was she? 还是说她并非如此？

Though it didn't help me stop hesitating. I just couldn't see her cry. I knew she would stop crying as soon as I go back to her and hold her. I knew what to do. But was it the right thing to do?  
尽管这并未让我停止犹豫。我就是无法看到她哭泣。我知道只要我回到她身边抱住她，她就会停止哭泣。我知道该怎么做。但这真的是正确的做法吗？

Slowly I dragged my feet toward her again. I saw a smile broke out from her tears. I smiled back. As long as she would stop crying, I could still-  
我慢慢地再次拖着脚步向她走去。我看到她的泪水间绽开了笑容。我也回以微笑。只要她能停止哭泣，我还能继续——

**Chapter 40: Soul and Heart  
第四十章：灵魂与心灵**

The EVA testing chamber was unusually hushed, considering the significance of the sync test that was taking place that day – Unit 02 had been mostly repaired, save for parts of its frontal chest armor plates where the last Angel hit the hardest.  
EVA 测试舱内异常安静，考虑到当天进行的同步测试的重要性——02 号机大部分已修复，除了正面胸甲板的部分，那里是最后一个使徒攻击最猛烈的地方。

"Alright. Begin the test." Dr. Akagi ordered. Maya started to type the series of commands into the terminal with a steady and no hurry pace, as if the test was nothing more than a normal scheduled sync test.  
“好的，开始测试。”赤木博士命令道。真希开始稳稳地、不慌不忙地在终端上输入一系列指令，仿佛这只是一次普通的同步测试。

"…A-10 connections established," Maya reported. "Pilot Soryu's sync rate is stabilizing."  
“……A-10 连接已建立，”真希报告道，“碇唯的同步率正在稳定。”

Dr. Ritsuko Akagi walked over next to Maya and looked at the screen showing Asuka's sync rate. "Whoa. A whole twenty percent dive from the last sync test."  
赤木律子博士走到真嗣身边，看着屏幕上显示的明日香同步率。“哇，比上次同步测试整整下降了二十个百分点。”

"It's understandable." Misato, who was standing at the far corner of the observation room, spoke up. "I mean, she's been through a lot recently, not to mention that Shinji's…Damn it, we still can't get Shinji back!" Misato growled in frustration. The last few days' rescue attempts were futile while Asuka's mentality continued to deteriorate to the extent Misato was seriously considering ordering a suicide watch on her. "If he's here, he will know what to do. They are practically glued together."  
“这可以理解。”站在观察室远角的美里开口说道，“我是说，她最近经历了很多，更别提真嗣他……该死，我们还是无法找回真嗣！”美里懊恼地咆哮着。过去几天的救援尝试都徒劳无功，而明日香的心理状态持续恶化，以至于美里认真考虑要对她进行自杀监视。“如果他在这里，他会知道该怎么做。他们几乎形影不离。”

Dr. Akagi shrugged. In fact, she wasn't really trying her best to get him out, instead she put collecting data and testing theories on the top of her priority list. The smack in the face by seeing the Commander caring about Shinji still stung. "But if her sync rate keeps dropping, in two weeks she won't be able to activate her EVA."  
律子博士耸了耸肩。事实上，她并没有尽全力去救他，而是把收集数据和测试理论放在了优先级列表的首位。看到司令关心真嗣的那一巴掌，至今仍让她感到刺痛。“但如果她的同步率继续下降，两周后她将无法启动她的 EVA。”

"Just like the old times, eh?" Misato let out a short laugh, opening a comm channel to Unit 02's entry plug. "Asuka, try focus harder." However, she didn't really get a reply from her. Frowning, Misato pulled up the video feed to inside the entry plug.  
“就像往常一样，是吧？” 美里轻笑一声，打开与二号机插入栓的通讯频道。“明日香，试着更专注些。”然而，她并未得到她的回应。美里皱起眉头，调出了插入栓内的视频画面。

From the screen, she could see the Second Child glaring at something at her front left intently, her expression unreadable. Following her gaze, Misato walked to the windows and looked at the front left side of Unit 02 – on the catwalk, the silver-haired Fifth Child stood there with a smirk on his face.  
从屏幕上，她能看到二号机驾驶员正紧盯着前方左侧的某物，表情难以捉摸。顺着她的视线，美里走到窗边，望向二号机的前方左侧——在走道上，银发的五号机驾驶员正站在那里，脸上带着一丝嘲讽的笑意。

Misato shook her head, unable to make sense of his actions. "Asuka, do you think we need to stop the test for today?"  
美里摇了摇头，无法理解他的行为。“明日香，你觉得我们今天需要停止测试吗？”

"No." This time she replied instantly, though her voice was hollow enough to make Misato shiver.  
"不。" 这次她立刻回答，尽管她的声音空洞到让美里都感到一阵寒意。

Inside Unit 02's entry plug, Asuka narrowed her eyes on the Fifth Child as he kept his smile at her. It should be impossible for people outside of the EVA to see what's going on inside, however she still felt Kaworu's gaze was directed at her soul, not just the general direction.  
在二号机的插入栓内，明日香眯起眼睛盯着第五适格者，他保持着对她的微笑。按理说，外面的人不可能看到 EVA 内部的情况，但她仍然感觉渚薰的目光是直指她的灵魂，而非仅仅是方向。

Though it wouldn't matter for long.  
尽管这不会持续太久。

Asuka closed her right eye and focused.  
明日香闭上她的右眼，集中精神。

"…alright, that's enough for today. End the test." Dr. Akagi put down the notepad.  
“……好了，今天到此为止。结束测试。”赤城博士放下笔记本。

"Roger," Maya replied. "Shut-" She trailed off, her eyes went wide as the readings went crazy. "Wait! Pilot Soryu's sync rate! It's spiking! Eighty, nighty, still hasn't stopped!"  
“收到，”真希波回答。“关闭——”她话音未落，眼睛瞪大，因为读数开始疯狂跳动。“等等！惣流驾驶员的同步率！它在飙升！八十，九十，还在上升！”

"What the hell is happening?!" Ritsuko rushed over to the terminal. "Send force shut down code!"  
"到底发生了什么？！" 律子冲向终端。"发送强制关闭代码！"

"I can't!" Maya shouted. "The signal won't receive!"  
"我做不到！" 真嗣喊道。"信号无法接收！"

"Is it the Angel?!" Misato asked with a dreading voice.  
"是使徒吗？！" 美里用颤抖的声音问道。

"No! There's no pattern blue! It's the pilot!"  
"不！没有蓝色模式！是驾驶员！"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

The whole observation room shook, windows shattered as Unit 02 let out a bone-chilling roar, breaking away from the restraints without so much as struggle. With a forceful punch on the separation wall, the heavy metal armor broke apart, leaving a huge hole on the wall.  
整个观察室都在震动，窗户碎裂，02 号机发出令人毛骨悚然的咆哮，毫无挣扎地挣脱了束缚。它一拳猛击分离墙，厚重的金属装甲破裂开来，墙上留下了一个巨大的洞。

_"…Hello Asuka, this is Shinji speaking. If you're listening to this recording, it most likely means I'm gone. (Sigh) Well, perhaps not dead, but definitely not available. Well, first and foremost I'd like to say sorry. I'm sorry for bringing you so much trouble and pain…"  
"…你好，明日香，我是真嗣。如果你听到这段录音，很可能意味着我已经不在了。（叹气）嗯，也许不是死了，但肯定是不在了。首先，我想说对不起。我很抱歉给你带来了这么多麻烦和痛苦…"_

_Asuka went mouth agape as the words of her lover flowed into her ears. Trouble? Pain? What the hell was Shinji talking about? And the voice he used…so sad and lonely, she'd never heard him speaking in that tone ever before.  
明日香听到恋人的话语流入耳中，嘴巴不由自主地张开。麻烦？痛苦？真嗣到底在说什么鬼话？而且他的声音……如此悲伤和孤独，她从未听过他用这种语调说话。_

_"…And I'd like to thank you for the ray of light you brought into my life. (Chuckle) Really, I don't know how I am going to even live without you anymore…"  
“……我想感谢你为我生命带来的那一束光。（轻笑）真的，我不知道没有你我该怎么活下去……”_

_Asuka's grip on the SDAT tightened. Fighting back the tears, Asuka smiled a sad smile and listened in.  
明日香紧紧握住 SDAT，强忍泪水，苦笑着继续聆听。_

_"…Though there's something I need to tell you right now. You need to be prepared for what I'm about to say. Do you trust me, Asuka?"  
“……不过，有件事我现在必须告诉你。你得做好心理准备，听我说接下来的话。你相信我吗，明日香？”_

_"Yes, I do. Absolutely." Her reply came without the slightest amount of delay.  
“是的，我愿意。绝对愿意。”她的回答没有丝毫迟疑。_

_As if Shinji had been expecting her saying this when he did the recording, his voice continued right after Asuka's response.  
仿佛真嗣在录音时就预料到她会如此回应，他的声音紧随在明日香的话音之后继续响起。_

_"…The Fifth Child, Kaworu Nagisa, is the last Angel…"  
“……第五适格者，渚薰，是最后的使徒……”_

_Under normal circumstances, she would've jumped in exuberance that her suspicion was correct, though right now, the mood was so heavy she only took the information.  
在正常情况下，她本会因自己的猜疑得到证实而欢欣雀跃，但此刻气氛沉重，她只是默默接受了这一信息。_

_"… Don't think after the last Angel is defeated, everything will go back to normal. SEELE…well, the evil people behind NERV, are planning to end the world with their scenario. I know you must have so many questions, but just trust me right now. They will launch an invasion against NERV, so stay at HQ and maintain combat readiness…"  
"…别以为最后一个使徒被击败后，一切都会恢复正常。SEELE…嗯，NERV 背后的邪恶势力，正计划用他们的剧本终结世界。我知道你一定有很多疑问，但眼下请相信我。他们将对 NERV 发动入侵，所以留在总部并保持战斗准备…"_

_"…The capabilities of the MP EVAs…"  
"…MP EVAs 的能力…"_

_Asuka, though under shell shock, still managed to take some notes of the information.  
尽管处于震惊之中，明日香还是设法记下了一些信息。_

_"…After everything settles…if I'm still not back, open track 27. You will have all of your answers on that track. Again, I'm sorry Asuka. I love you. If we can meet again…trust me, I will explain everything…the next time I see you. Goodbye."  
“…一切尘埃落定后…如果我仍未归来，请播放第 27 轨。你会在那轨中找到所有答案。再次，对不起，明日香。我爱你。如果我们能再次相见…请相信我，我会解释一切…下次见面时。再见。”_

_Beep._

_It was only after 3 minutes of utter silence Asuka remembered that she was still gripping on the SDAT so hard that her hand started to turn purple. "Stupid Shinji…" Slowly, she rose from Shinji's futon and put the SDAT back on the table.  
整整三分钟的绝对沉默后，明日香才意识到自己还紧紧抓着 SDAT，手都开始发紫了。“笨蛋真嗣…”她缓缓从真嗣的被褥上起身，将 SDAT 放回桌上。_

_She had a lot of questions. But for now, she knew she needed to trust him.  
她有许多疑问。但此刻，她知道她需要信任他。_

On the catwalk, standing in front of the giant fist that punched toward him, Kaworu Nagisa let a sorrowful smile cross his face.  
在 T 台上，站在那只向他挥来的巨大拳头前，渚薰的脸上掠过一丝哀伤的微笑。

Asuka shrieked as Unit 02's left fist punched through the wall and reached Kaworu's position. Having a firm grip on the boy, Unit 02 brought him into the air, close to its ferocious face.  
明日香尖叫着，02 号机左拳穿透墙壁，直抵薰的位置。牢牢抓住少年后，02 号机将他举至空中，靠近那张凶猛的面孔。

"Asuka! What the heck are you doing?!" Misato shouted into the microphone, her ears still hurting from the rumbling roar. "Put him down!"  
“明日香！你到底在干什么？！”美里对着麦克风大喊，耳边仍回荡着轰鸣的巨响。“把他放下！”

"Your words aren't gonna work, Major." It was a miracle that Dr. Akagi still maintained a somewhat calm semblance of composure under the situation. "I think… she's finally lost it."  
"你的话不管用，少校。" 在这种情形下，赤木律子博士还能保持某种程度的镇定，简直是个奇迹。"我想……她终于崩溃了。"

"Got any last words, Angel boy?!" A distorted cry echoed from the testing chamber to the observation room, eliciting raised eyebrows from nearly everyone, Gendo Ikari not excluding.  
"有什么遗言吗，天使小子？！" 扭曲的喊声从测试室传到观察室，几乎让每个人都挑起了眉毛，碇源堂也不例外。

"What are you talking about, Asuka?!" Despite the sharp tone she was using, Misato didn't try to do anything to stop her. For all she knew there was undoubtedly some fishiness around the Fifth Child – though being an Angel wasn't exactly the first thing she would've guessed, it was close enough.  
"你在说什么，明日香？！" 尽管语气尖锐，美里并没有试图阻止她。她知道，第五适格者周围无疑有些可疑之处——虽然成为使徒并不是她首先会猜到的，但也差不多了。

"So I see this is the answer you've got, Asu-_Pilot Soryu,_" Kaworu shook his head slightly, keeping the smirk on his face and seemingly not perturbed by the fact he was held by a giant metallic hand that could end his life in an instant. "I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this right now."  
"看来这就是你得到的答案了，明日香·驾驶员·绫波，" 渚薰微微摇头，脸上保持着一丝戏谑的笑容，似乎并不在意自己被一只巨大的金属手掌握住，那只手随时可以结束他的生命。"抱歉，我现在没时间陪你玩。"

"Aren't you missing something here?" Asuka sneered. "Time is at my side. Not yours." With that, the cold-blooded Second Child willed her EVA to squeeze its hand.  
"你是不是忽略了什么？" 明日香冷笑道。"时间在我这边，不在你那儿。" 说完，这位冷酷的第二适格者命令她的 EVA 收紧手掌。

Though she soon found herself unable to squeeze tighter as if she was crushing a solid stone instead of a piece of flesh. "What the fuck?"  
然而她很快发现自己无法再用力，仿佛握住的是一块坚硬的石头而非血肉之躯。"搞什么鬼？"

"Pattern Blue! It's an Angel!" Makoto's sudden announcement drew everyone's attention. People in the observation room watched in horror as an orange octangular box appeared around the Fifth Child and expanded, quickly helping the boy get rid of Unit 02's grasp. The seventeenth Angel floated in the air, smirking at the camera that connected with the main screen of the observation room.  
"蓝色模式！是使徒！" 真嗣的突然宣告吸引了所有人的注意。观测室里的人们惊恐地看着一个橙色的八角形盒子出现在第五适格者周围并扩大，迅速帮助少年摆脱了 02 号机的抓握。第十七使徒悬浮在空中，对着连接观测室主屏幕的摄像头冷笑。

"Damn it… he's actually an Angel!"  
"该死……他竟然真的是使徒！"

"What? No!" “什么？不！”

With an explosive uncurl, Kaworu's AT-Field crushed and tumbled the metal wall separating Unit 02 and Unit 03 while sending a shocked Unit 02 stumble back and crashed against the wall. "Let's go, Unit 03. The alter ego of Adam, servant of the Lilim. Now it's your time to awaken!"  
随着一声爆炸般的展开，渚薰的 AT 力场粉碎并掀翻了分隔二号机与三号机的金属墙，同时令震惊的二号机踉跄后退，撞上了墙壁。“走吧，三号机。亚当的半身，莉莉姆的仆从。现在是你觉醒的时刻了！”

The black slits around Unit 03's eyes began to glow with a brilliant red light that forced people in the observation room to cover their eyes as it let out a bellowing roar that shook the entire testing chamber.  
零三号机眼周的黑色裂缝开始发出耀眼的红光，迫使观察室里的人们不得不遮住眼睛，随后它发出一声震耳欲聋的咆哮，整个测试室都为之震动。

Closing her eyes and covering her ears, Asuka tried to endure the incredible noise, but found it rumbling her entire body as if she was right next to an explosion despite the cushion provided by her EVA. The roar continued for another few seconds before beginning to fade away, allowing for the redhead was able to open her eyes and move her hands from over her ears. She quickly looked up and down the cages, but found that Kaworu and Unit 03 were gone, leaving only her with Unit 02 and the sleeping Units 01 and Unit 00.  
明日香闭上眼睛，捂住耳朵，试图忍受这惊人的噪音，却发现它如同爆炸般震撼着她的全身，尽管有 EVA 的缓冲。咆哮持续了几秒钟才开始减弱，让红发少女得以睁开眼睛，放下捂住耳朵的双手。她迅速环顾四周的笼子，却发现真嗣和零三号机已经消失，只剩下她和零二号机以及沉睡中的零一号机和零零号机。

Being the most militarily experienced person in the whole room, Major Katsuragi was the first one to recover from the ordeal. "Asuka! Go after him!" She shouted before turning to Maya. "Where is Rei? I don't want Asuka fighting him and Unit 03 alone!"  
作为整个房间里军事经验最丰富的人，葛城美里少校是第一个从这场混乱中恢复过来的人。“明日香！追上去！”她喊道，然后转向伊吹摩耶，“绫波在哪里？我不希望明日香独自对抗他和零三号机！”

"The equipment in the room is all broken! We need to go back to the command deck!" Maya reported, ignoring the cut on her hands produced by shattered glass.  
“房间里的设备全坏了！我们得回指挥舱！”真希波报告道，无视了手上因碎玻璃造成的伤口。

Asuka shook her head, trying to clear her foggy brain. "I'm on it." She said, controlling Unit 02 jump down into the hole Unit 03 had just disappeared into.  
明日香摇了摇头，试图驱散脑中的迷雾。“我来处理。”她说着，操控二号机跳进了三号机刚刚消失的洞口。

As Kaworu and the black EVA Unit 03 continued their descent toward the deepest level of Central Dogma, the boy made a smirk as he thought about what awaited him at the end of his journey.  
当渚薰和黑色 EVA 三号机继续向中央教条最深层下降时，少年微微一笑，心中想着旅程尽头等待他的会是什么。

Once he was again one with Adam, the disgusting race that was Lilim would be no more, and he was more than happy to help. He had thought that the Lilim species was redeemable after his talk with Shinji, the person who he thought could represent the whole race. Though he soon found out that he was just too naïve after the scene that the Second Child had just pulled up against him.  
一旦他再次与亚当合为一体，那令人作呕的莉莉姆种族将不复存在，而他非常乐意助一臂之力。在与他认为能代表整个种族的人——真嗣交谈后，他曾以为莉莉姆是有救赎可能的。然而，当二号机驾驶员刚刚对他施展的那一幕发生后，他很快意识到自己太过天真了。

After all, Lilim was mainly manipulative and untrustworthy.  
毕竟，莉莉姆主要以操纵和不可信赖著称。

Perhaps that was why he felt a tinge of anger in his chest when he heard the blood lusted screams of Unit 02's pilot as the crimson Evangelion shot downwards towards him and Unit 03, its progressive knife in hand.  
也许这就是为什么当他听到零二号机驾驶员充满杀意的尖叫声时，心中会涌起一丝愤怒，那台红色的福音战士手持推进刀，朝他和零三号机俯冲下来。

"Angel boy, you bastard!" Asuka screamed, lurching her EVA forward to reach out to the black EVA, holding the progressive knife at hand. The black Unit 03 quickly came in front of Kaworu in a position to defend him.  
"天使少年，你这个混蛋！" 明日香尖叫着，操控她的 EVA 向前冲去，手中紧握着高频刀。黑色 EVA-03 迅速挡在渚薰面前，摆出防御姿态。

"Pilot Soryu, this isn't going to work." The Angel spoke, hovering off to the side of the two EVAs as not to get in their way of fighting.  
"惣流驾驶员，这招行不通的。" 天使说道，悬浮在两台 EVA 旁边，以免妨碍他们的战斗。

With a roar of rage, Asuka lunged her knife forward to pierce through his small and frail body. She cursed as the tip of the blade was blocked by a semi-transparent octangular wall just before it was about to make contact. "Damn it, why is this stupid AT-Field so hard to breach!"  
伴随着一声怒吼，明日香猛地将刀刺向前，试图穿透他那瘦小的身躯。刀尖在即将接触的瞬间被一道半透明的八角形力场阻挡，她咒骂道："该死，为什么这个愚蠢的 AT 力场这么难突破！"

"Is that what you Lilim call it?" Kaworu smirked, looking up at the red EVA that towered over him. "An AT-Field...is the light of your soul. All living creatures have one, though only the Angels and Evangelions are able to generate ones so strong."  
"这就是你们莉莉姆所谓的吗？" 渚薰微微一笑，抬头望向那红色的 EVA，它在他上方巍然耸立。"AT 力场...是你们灵魂的光芒。所有生物都有，但只有使徒和 EVA 能产生如此强大的力场。"

"I don't know what you're talking about, but I know I'm gonna kill you!" Screaming, Asuka brought the prog knife down again, just to be blocked by Unit 03 again with its own knife.  
"我不知道你在说什么，但我知道我要杀了你！" 明日香尖叫着，再次挥下高频刀，却又被 03 号机用其自身的刀挡住了。"

"Why are you so persistent?" Kaworu said. "What is it that you want, Pilot Soryu? My offer should be more than enough for you."  
"你为何如此执着？" 渚薰说道。"你究竟想要什么，惣流·明日香·兰格雷？我的提议对你来说应该足够了。"

"I. Want. Shinji. BACK!" Asuka screamed as she willed Unit 02 sprang off the wall using its legs and leap towards the enemy. However, Unit 03 seemed to be calmer than Asuka who was in an agitated state. The black EVA Unit delivered a sidekick just at the right time, sending Unit 02 to the side and smacked on the wall.  
"我要. 真嗣. 回来！" 明日香尖叫着，她操控零二号机用双腿从墙上弹开，向敌人跃去。然而，零三号机似乎比处于激动状态的明日香更为冷静。黑色 EVA 单位恰到好处地侧踢一脚，将零二号机踢到一边，重重地撞在墙上。

"Is that all you want? Lilim are indeed unfathomable." He shook his head. "Such a fragile, yet strong heart…"  
"你就只想要这些吗？人类确实难以捉摸。" 他摇了摇头。"如此脆弱，却又坚强的心……"

Kaworu exhaled as he watched the fight continue. As they approached lower levels of Central Dogma, the feeling of the presence of his kin grew stronger as well.  
渚薰呼出一口气，注视着战斗的继续。随着他们接近中央教条的较低层，他感受到同类的存在感也越发强烈。

As the two EVAs reached the end of their descent, Kaworu looked around to see that the Central Dogma was covered in a strange white substance that he could very well recognize as the condensation of LCL. This likely meant that he was getting very close to his kin.  
当两台 EVA 降落至终点时，渚薰环顾四周，发现中央教条区被一种奇特的白色物质覆盖，他立刻认出这是 LCL 的凝结物。这很可能意味着他离自己的同类越来越近了。

Smashing hard into the bottom level of Central Dogma, Unit 02 and 03 forced themselves back to their feet from their imbalanced state. Through the monitors, Asuka could see that she was still hanging onto her prog knife. Unfortunately, Unit 03 still had its own knife as well. As she lifted the crimson EVA onto its feet, she could see the Angel floating away from the EVAs and making his way further into Central Dogma.  
两台 EVA——02 号和 03 号——重重地撞击在中央教条区的底层，随即从失衡状态中挣扎起身。通过监视器，明日香看到自己仍紧握着那把进度之刃。不幸的是，03 号 EVA 也还保留着它的刀。当她将红色 EVA 扶起时，可以看到使徒正从 EVA 们身边飘离，向中央教条区深处移动。

Asuka cried a battle cry and willed her EVA dash forward, just to be toppled over by the black Unit 03. Utilizing the moment of its imbalance state, Unit 03 brought both of its knives down onto the back of the crimson EVA.  
明日香发出战斗的呐喊，指挥她的 EVA 向前冲刺，却被黑色的 03 号 EVA 撞倒。利用这一失衡瞬间，03 号 EVA 将双刀猛地劈向红色 EVA 的背部。

Utilizing her moment of distraction, Unit 03 lunged at Unit 02 and tackled it down to the ground.  
利用这一瞬间的分神，三号机猛扑向二号机，将其扑倒在地。

"Ahhh!" Asuka screamed in pain, her sync rate was too high to mediate the sensations. Unit 03 wasted no time and began a series of vicious attacks. Asuka tried her best to dodge the potentially lethal attacks, though she knew she couldn't last longer – not to mention Kaworu was getting away from her as well.  
“啊！”明日香痛苦地尖叫，她的同步率过高，无法调节这些感觉。三号机毫不迟疑地展开了一系列猛烈攻击。明日香竭尽全力躲避这些可能致命的攻击，尽管她知道自己撑不了多久——更不用说，渚薰也在从她身边逃走。

Muttering all of her strength, Asuka screamed in desperation.  
明日香用尽全身力气，绝望地尖叫起来。

"STUPID-SHINJI! DO SOMETHING! ANYTHING!"  
"笨蛋真嗣！做点什么！什么都行！"

Inside the Evangelion chamber, Unit 01's eyes glowed.  
在 EVA 驾驶舱内，零一机的眼睛闪烁着光芒。

Farther into the depths of Central Dogma, Kaworu approached the final gate separating him from Adam. "Hello, Adam." He said as he came close to the giant white, masked humanoid before him. "I have finally retur-" He stopped in his tracks as he carefully examined the giant creature. The field of presence that the creature was radiating was indeed Angelic, however, it was different from Adam - in fact, it could be said as polar opposite. "Lilith?"  
在中央教条更深处，渚薰接近了将他与亚当隔开的最后一道门。“你好，亚当。”他走近面前巨大的白色面具人形生物说道，“我终于回来了——”他突然停下脚步，仔细打量着这个巨型生物。它散发出的存在场确实是天使般的，然而，这与亚当不同——事实上，可以说是截然相反。“莉莉丝？”

Suddenly it all came together as he gazed at the giant figure mounted to the blood-red cross. He had thought that he was the one manipulating SEELE by agreeing to their plans and so on, so that ultimately he could reunite with Adam with minimum resistance. Now it seemed like he was actually the one being manipulated this entire time, and sent into a deathtrap for whatever reasons SEELE had.  
突然间，一切在他凝视着那巨大身影被钉在血红色的十字架上时汇聚起来。他原以为自己通过同意 SEELE 的计划等手段在操纵 SEELE，以便最终能以最小的阻力与亚当重聚。现在看来，他才是那个一直被操纵的人，被送入了一个死亡陷阱，无论 SEELE 出于何种原因。

He had thought the Lilim were easy to manipulate. Now it seemed like nearly everyone he had met was manipulating him.  
他曾以为莉莉姆们容易操纵。现在看来，几乎每个他遇到的人都在操纵他。

The smirk on his face faded, replaced by a distorted scowl.  
他脸上的讥笑消失了，取而代之的是扭曲的怒容。

Slowly, Kaworu floated back to the battlefield of Unit 02 and Unit 03. Looking down at the severely damaged form of Unit 02, the Angel of Free Will cracked an evil grin. "Hello, Second Child." Speaking, Kaworu made Unit 03 stopped its attacks with a snap of fingers. Seeing the odd scene, Asuka hastily stood back to her feet and entered a combat stance. "I think I've finally reached a conclusion about you Lilim."  
缓缓地，渚薰飘回了初号机和零号机的战场。俯视着严重受损的零号机，自由意志的天使露出了邪恶的笑容。“你好，第二适格者。”说着，渚薰打了个响指，让零号机停止了攻击。看到这奇怪的场景，明日香匆忙站起身来，进入战斗姿态。“我想我终于对你这人类得出了结论。”

"I want you to shut up!" Asuka cried, lurching at the floating boy again with the knife in her hand. Though to no avail as she still couldn't neutralize his AT-Field.  
“给我闭嘴！”明日香喊道，再次手持刀具冲向飘浮的少年。然而，她依旧无法突破他的 AT 力场。

"Save your breaths, Second Child. I just want you to know that…" His grin widened. "That you Lilim are irredeemable, ugly creatures. I shall purge your kind from the face of the planet."  
“省省你的力气吧，第二适格者。我只是想让你知道……”他的笑容扩大了。“你们人类是无可救药、丑陋的生物。我将把你们这一族从地球上彻底清除。”

"Over my dead body!" Asuka shrieked.  
“除非我死了！”明日香尖叫道。

"Your suggestion is accepted." Kaworu replied. Asuka raised an eyebrow in surprise – perhaps it was because of the matter-of-fact tone he was using, or maybe it was his intensely glowing red eyes.  
“你的建议被采纳了。”渚薰回答。明日香惊讶地挑了挑眉——或许是因为他用了一种公事公办的语气，又或许是因为他那双炽烈的红眸。

Scowling slightly, Kaworu mustered all of the strength to expand his AT-Field. The entire chamber shook as a brilliant white light exploded, after that, everything went dark.  
渚薰微微皱眉，竭尽全力扩展自己的 AT 力场。整个房间在一片耀眼的白光爆炸后，陷入了一片黑暗。

"Major Katsuragi!" Makoto called out in a panicked voice as his screen turned completely black. "The Angel has just generated the strongest AT-Field I've ever seen! It has blocked out everything and shut down our facilities!"  
“葛城少校！”真嗣惊慌失措地喊道，他的屏幕完全变黑了。“使徒刚刚生成了我所见过的最强的 AT 力场！它屏蔽了一切，并关闭了我们的设施！”

"Damn it!" Misato stomped her boot onto the ground, gritting her teeth. "Initiate self-destruct sequence! There's nothing we can do right now!"  
“该死！”美里用力跺了跺脚，咬紧牙关。“启动自毁程序！我们现在无计可施！”

"I can't!" The technician replied frantically. "The electricity is out as well!"  
“我做不到！”技术员慌乱地回答。“电力也中断了！”

Misato let out a gasp, feeling her heart had just skipped a beat. "Then that means it's all up to Asuka now. There's nothing we can do."  
美里倒抽一口凉气，感觉心跳仿佛漏了一拍。“那就意味着现在全靠明日香了。我们无能为力。”

Soon the redhead found herself restraint on the ground with her back downward, unable to move an inch despite the incredible power the Evangelions possessed. Looking up at the last Angel, Asuka gritted her teeth. No matter how hard it was for her to admit, she stood no chance of winning against him, not to mention the motionless Unit 03 standing beside her could reactivate at any time.  
很快，红发少女发现自己被压制在地，背部朝下，尽管拥有使徒的惊人力量，却动弹不得。抬头望着最后的使徒，明日香咬紧牙关。无论多么难以承认，她知道自己毫无胜算，更不用说一旁静止不动的零三号机随时可能重新启动。

"Now, I'll start from you…" Kaworu raised his hand and started applying more pressure. Asuka felt her whole body being crushed to a thin sheet as Unit 02 struggled against the powerful AT-Filed, its armor denting and creaking.  
“现在，从你开始……”薰抬起手，开始施加更多压力。明日香感到全身被压成薄片，零二号机在与强大的 AT 力场抗争中，装甲凹陷，发出吱嘎声。

Asuka closed her eyes. 明日香闭上了眼睛。

"Kaworu!" A voice echoed from above. Wide-eyed, the Angel rose his eyes up and watched as another Evangelion dove towards him, releasing the pressure on the AT-Field. "Shinji?"  
“薰！”一个声音从上方传来。天使睁大了眼睛，抬头望去，只见另一台 EVA 向他俯冲而来，释放了 AT 力场的压力。“真嗣？”

"Get your damned hands off her!" Shinji intervened as Unit 01 made an impactful landing on the ground. "Let her go!"  
“放开她，该死！”真嗣介入，初号机重重地落在地上。“让她走！”

Kaworu narrowed his eyes; with a wave of the hand, Unit 03 was reactivated. "I'm sorry, Shinji. But all born from Adam must return to Adam. If the only way to achieve so is to wipe out the entire humanity, I have no choice but to proceed."  
渚薰眯起了眼睛；他一挥手，初号机 03 重新启动。“对不起，真嗣。但所有源自亚当的必须回归亚当。如果唯一的办法是消灭全人类，我别无选择，只能继续前进。”

Shinji didn't even try to argue. He knew anything would be in vain at this stage. "Asuka? Asuka are you alright?!"  
真嗣甚至没有试图争辩。他知道在这个阶段任何努力都是徒劳的。“明日香？明日香你还好吗？！”

"Why does she mean so much to you? Are all Lilim so-"  
“为什么她对你如此重要？难道所有人类都是这样-”

He was cut off as Unit 02's fist sent him flying away across the Central Dogma.  
他的话音未落，就被二号机的拳头击飞，横穿中央教条区。

"Ouch." “哎哟。”

"Ha! Eat THAT!" Came the excited redheaded exclaim. "I'm fine, Shinji! Let's just get this over with!" Even though she thought she should be jumping in exuberance that Shinji somehow came back, Asuka knew the priority was to take out the Angel right now.  
“哈！吃我一拳！”红发的她兴奋地喊道，“我没事，真嗣！赶紧解决掉这家伙！”尽管她内心无比激动，因为真嗣竟然奇迹般地回来了，但明日香明白，眼下首要任务是消灭使徒。

"I'm tired of these games," Kaworu growled, expanding his AT-Field again. Unit 01 uncurled its own field as well, clashing against Kaworu's and Unit 03's.  
"我已经厌倦了这些游戏，" 渚薰咆哮着，再次展开了他的 AT 力场。初号机也展开了自己的力场，与渚薰和三号机的力场相撞。

"Asuka! Can you hold off Unit 03?" Shinji shouted into the microphone. "I'll deal with Kaworu!"  
"明日香！你能牵制住三号机吗？" 真嗣对着麦克风大喊，"我来对付渚薰！"

"I'll do my best!" "我会尽力的！"

"Stop wasting your time and accept fate." Kaworu returned floating in the air. "I'll just-Huh?" He trailed off as he felt another powerful AT-Field clashing against him. Following the direction of the source and raising his head to look at the ceiling, Kaworu's grin disappeared as he recognized the source of the invader. "First Child."  
“别再浪费时间，接受命运吧。”渚薰在空中飘浮着回来。“我只是——嗯？”他话音未落，便感受到另一股强大的 AT 力场与他相撞。顺着源头方向抬头望向天花板，渚薰的笑容消失了，因为他认出了入侵者的身份。“第一适格者。”

Though the presence of Rei Ayanami went unnoticed by the Second Child; Shinji stopped himself from calling out her name, seeing that Asuka wasn't aware of her as she focused on fighting Unit 03.  
尽管绫波零的存在未被第二适格者察觉；真嗣见状，忍住了呼唤她名字的冲动，因为明日香正专注于与 03 号机战斗，并未注意到她。

With Kaworu distracted, Unit 03's attacks went powerless and its speed slowed down. Asuka took the chance and delivered a lethal attack on its shining core, shattering it with all of her might.  
趁着渚薰分心，03 号机的攻击变得无力，速度也减缓下来。明日香抓住机会，对准其闪耀的核心发动致命一击，倾尽全力将其粉碎。

"Congratulations, Second and the Third Child." The Angel's voice muttered from the speakers, coming out in static as they started to short circuit. "You've beaten me."  
"恭喜，第二适格者和第三适格者。" 天使的声音从扬声器中低语，随着开始短路而发出静电声。"你们打败了我。"

Asuka willed her EVA rushing forward and coming up in front of the final Angel. "Now I've got you!" She exclaimed, grabbing the Angel with her hand again.  
明日香操控她的 EVA 向前冲去，来到最后的使徒面前。"现在你逃不掉了！"她大喊着，再次用手抓住使徒。

Kaworu let out a resigned sigh. He still had something to say. Maybe he could play a mind game with her, considering-  
渚薰发出一声无奈的叹息。他还有话要说。也许他可以对她玩一场心理游戏，考虑到——

_CRUSH_

"The seventeenth Angel is neutralized," Asuka watched the bloody pulp on her EVA's hand with loath, feeling the fleshy sensation through the neural connections.  
“第十七使徒已被消灭，”明日香厌恶地看着 EVA 手上血肉模糊的一团，通过神经连接感受到那肉感的触觉。

"…Asuka! Thank God! The communication system was jammed, and Unit 01 suddenly went berserk. Shinji came out of nowhere as well. we thought…" Misato's worried voice came through the speakers. "…Anyway, I'm just glad that both of you are okay. Now, can you head back to the EVA cages by yourselves?"  
“……明日香！谢天谢地！通讯系统被堵塞了，零号机突然发狂。真嗣也不知从哪儿冒出来的。我们以为……”美里焦急的声音从扬声器中传来。“……总之，我很高兴你们俩都没事。现在，你们能自己回到 EVA 格纳库吗？”

"Yeah, we'll be there in a minute," Asuka said before shutting off the comm channel to the command deck and opening an encrypted channel to Unit 01. "Shinji."  
“嗯，我们马上就到，”明日香说完便关闭了与指挥室的通讯频道，转而向零号机开启了加密频道。“真嗣。”

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Shinji…I'm so happy that you came back to me. I don't know what happened to you when you're inside Unit 01, but it's your presence that matters. But...I need an answer. I really do. Please be honest with me, alright?"  
"真嗣…你回来了，我真高兴。我不知道你在初号机里经历了什么，但重要的是你的存在。可是...我需要一个答案。真的需要。请诚实地告诉我，好吗？"

"Okay," Shinji replied. "Let's go home first, alright?"  
"好的，"真嗣回答。"我们先回家吧，好吗？"

…

Several hours later, a loud BANG of door slamming could be heard from hundreds of yards of distance away from the Katsuragi residence.  
几个小时后，从距离葛城家数百码远的地方传来了门被猛力关上的巨大声响。

"Ahhh…" Lying on the floor and clutching his crotch tightly as he tried to soothe the pain, Shinji groaned in excruciating agony. It wasn't the first time that Asuka delivered a groin kicked at him, though, and every time she was angry at him enough for her to do it, he would doubt he would be having any children. That's why he had always been sympathetic to some boys in school who pushed too far in their advancements when they got kicked by her.  
“啊……” 躺在地上紧紧捂住下体试图缓解疼痛，真嗣痛苦地呻吟着。这已经不是第一次被明日香踢中下体了，每次她对他发怒到足以这么做时，他都会怀疑自己是否还能有孩子。正因如此，他总是对学校里那些因追求过度而被她踢中的男生抱有同情。

Though it wasn't his concern right now. He had tried to stop her when she cried and ran away, and he had yet to recover from the consequence of it. He also knew from his experience that his presence would only worsen the situation.  
尽管这并非他当前的关切所在。他曾试图在她哭泣跑开时阻止她，而至今仍未从那后果中恢复过来。他也从经验中知道，自己的出现只会让情况更糟。

Nonetheless, Asuka's safety, especially under her current emotional state, had to be ensured at all costs. Fortunately, this time he had a trusting person to do it for him.  
尽管如此，明日香的安全，尤其是在她当前的情绪状态下，必须不惜一切代价确保。幸运的是，这次他有一个值得信赖的人来替他完成这件事。

Shinji picked up his phone with shaking hands and tapped open the contact list.  
真嗣颤抖着手拿起手机，轻触打开了联系人列表。

"F-father…I need your help."  
“父、父亲……我需要你的帮助。”

Yamada had always thought of himself as a simple man, that was until he enrolled in Section 2 of NERV. At first, he had felt protecting the pilots of EVAs would be a challenging job to do, such as constantly dealing with assassins and other foes. However, he had quickly found the work rather boring since all the agents needed to do was to establish a loose perimeter around the pilots and a tighter one around the apartments.  
山田一直认为自己是个简单的人，直到他加入了 NERV 第二分部。起初，他觉得保护 EVA 驾驶员会是一项极具挑战的工作，比如要不断应对刺客和其他敌人。然而，他很快发现这份工作相当乏味，因为特工们只需在驾驶员周围建立一个松散的警戒圈，以及在公寓周围建立一个更严密的警戒圈。

They weren't allowed to interact with the pilots actively, nor to overly interfere with their daily lives by shooing away too many people from the pilot's routes. But, of course, no call from the Children was to be ignored under any circumstance. However, after seeing how well-trained the Second and the Third Child were in terms of hand-to-hand combat, he doubted his assistance would be ever needed.  
他们不被允许与驾驶员主动互动，也不能过度干扰他们的日常生活，比如驱赶太多人离开驾驶员的路线。但当然，任何来自孩子们的召唤在任何情况下都不容忽视。然而，在目睹了二号和三号机驾驶员在近身格斗方面的出色训练后，他怀疑自己是否还会有被需要的时候。

Today though, the strange – to the level of _arousing attention_ – the behavior of the Second Child had attracted his awareness instantly after she ran out of the apartment. If he knew better, he would say she was crying – and the Third Child didn't come out with her.  
然而今天，二号机驾驶员异常——甚至到了引人注意的程度——的行为，在她跑出公寓后立刻引起了他的注意。如果他了解得更清楚，他会说她是在哭泣——而三号机驾驶员并没有和她一起出来。

Just as he was about to report the odd sight to NERV HQ, a new mission briefing message popped up on his cellphone.  
正当他准备将这奇怪的景象报告给 NERV 总部时，手机上弹出了一条新的任务简报消息。

_Agent Yamada 山田特工_

_Mission Update: 任务更新：_

_New Mission: Enact A-100 Level of Security Protocols on the Second Child  
新任务：对第二子实施 A-100 级安全协议_

_Effective Time: Immediately  
生效时间：立即_

Yamada blinked. A-100 was Suicide Watch. Now the Second Child's behavior clicked in his head. Without any more delay, he slammed his foot on the gas pedal of his SUV and drove along the way where he saw her ran down while keeping searching for the Second Child.  
山田眨了眨眼。A-100 是自杀监视级别。现在，第二适格者的行为在他脑海中清晰起来。他没有再耽搁，猛踩 SUV 的油门，沿着她逃跑的方向疾驰，同时继续搜寻第二适格者的身影。

He was sure every other agent around the area received the message as he could see another Section 2 SUV for every block he went through. No one had found her yet? Cold sweat started forming on his forehead. If NERV required them to enact suicide watch, then it must mean the Second Child would very likely to-  
他确信该区域的每个特工都收到了消息，因为他每经过一个街区都能看到另一辆第二分部的 SUV。还没人找到她吗？冷汗开始在他的额头上形成。如果 NERV 要求他们实施自杀监视，那么这意味着第二适格者极有可能——

"Thank god," Yamada let out a long sigh of relief as he spotted the unmistakable slender silhouette of the Second Child on the bridge above a small river. Acting perfectly based on the procedure, he quickly parked his SUV two hundred meters away from her and got off the car. He then hurried to the backside and opened the trunk, taking out a sniper rifle and a black ammo box from it.  
"谢天谢地，"山田长舒一口气，目光锁定在小河上方桥上那道辨识度极高的纤细身影——二号适格者。他严格按照程序行事，迅速将 SUV 停在距她两百米远的地方，下车后疾步绕到车尾，打开后备箱，从中取出一把狙击步枪和一个黑色弹药箱。

Yamada silently walked closer to her and stopped fifty meters from her, hiding on a nearby bush. It was a safe distance, considering the traveling time of the anesthetic dart was relatively slow compared to regular bullets.  
山田默默地向她靠近，停在离她五十米远的地方，藏身于附近的灌木丛中。考虑到麻醉飞镖的飞行时间相对普通子弹较慢，这个距离算是安全的。

He set up the sniper rifle and took aim. In his peripheral version, he could see several other Section 2 agents doing the same, and a few others shooing away people who for whatever reasons entered the perimeter. He shook his head and returned his eyes to the scope.  
他架好狙击步枪，瞄准目标。眼角余光中，他瞥见几名第二分部的特工也在做同样的事，还有几人则在驱赶那些不知为何闯入警戒区的人们。他摇了摇头，将视线重新移回瞄准镜。

He couldn't see the Second Child's face since she was facing away from him, but from the way her body jerked and relating to his previous observations, he could very well guess that she was crying hard. A slight frown crossed his face as the thought reached him. The Second and the Third Children were basically inseparable lately, save for the days when Shinji got trapped in Unit 01. His only logical conclusion would be a bad fight between the two of the young couple.  
他看不到二号子的脸，因为她背对着他，但从她身体的抽动以及之前的观察来看，他完全可以猜到她在痛哭。这个念头让他微微皱起了眉头。最近，二号子和三号子几乎形影不离，除了真嗣被困在初号机里的那些日子。他唯一合理的结论是这对年轻情侣之间发生了激烈的争吵。

Singing, Yamada released the safety of the rifle. Being in the military ever since he was eighteen, he was well aware of how dangerous it could be when it comes to office relationships, especially in the army.  
山田松开了步枪的保险。自从十八岁参军以来，他非常清楚办公室恋情，尤其是在军队中，可能带来的危险。

From the scope, he could see the Second Child sitting on the bridge and hugging her knees, her poor silhouette trembled in the cool breeze. Suddenly Yamada felt a wave of uncontrollable anger surge up his chest. What did the boy do to her to hurt her so much? And he didn't even bother to follow her and make sure she was alright? If anything, he was-  
通过瞄准镜，他看到二号子坐在桥上，抱着膝盖，她那可怜的身影在凉风中颤抖。突然，山田感到一股无法控制的愤怒涌上心头。那个男孩对她做了什么，让她如此伤心？他甚至没有跟上去确保她没事？如果有什么的话，他——

Yamada tensed up, putting his index finger on the trigger as he saw the Second Child stand up and walk over to the edge of the bridge. The structure wasn't high from the water surface by any means, and they've already got several medical teams on stand-by around the area.  
山田紧张起来，将食指放在扳机上，因为他看到第二适格者站起身，走向桥边。这座桥离水面并不高，而且他们已经在周围安排了多支医疗队伍待命。

The anesthetic shot they used for suicide watches would put down a healthy adult male within a matter of seconds, biologically it would harm her body for all they know. However, it was still better than being dead, right?  
他们用于自杀监视的麻醉针能在几秒钟内让一个健康的成年男性倒下，从生物学角度来看，这对她的身体可能有害。然而，这总比死亡要好，对吧？

Just as he was about to squeeze the trigger, he saw the Second Child stopped abruptly just before the railings, looking down at the water surface intently. From the high magnification scope, he could see the clear tear streaks on her pale face. "What do we do?" He whispered into the walkie-talkie.  
正当他准备扣动扳机时，他看到第二适格者在栏杆前突然停下，专注地看着水面。通过高倍率瞄准镜，他能看到她苍白脸颊上清晰的泪痕。“我们该怎么办？”他对着对讲机低声说道。

"Observe." Came a calm reply from the speakers moments later.  
"观察。" 片刻后，扬声器中传来平静的回应。

It proved to be the better choice after the Second Child walked away from the edge and began pacing back in the general direction of the apartment. "Follow the target closely. Report any anomalies as soon as possible. You have permission to fire at will."  
事实证明，这是一个更好的选择，因为第二适格者从边缘走开，开始向公寓的大致方向踱步。"紧跟目标，密切监视。一旦发现异常，立即报告。你们有权随时开火。"

"Roger," Yamada confirmed, picking up his sniper rifle and started trailing behind the Second Child.  
"收到，" 山田确认道，拿起狙击步枪，开始尾随第二适格者。

Asuka stumbled forward like a lifeless zombie on the side of the street, her mind still replaying Shinji's confessions over and over again.  
明日香像一具无生命的僵尸般踉跄前行在街边，脑海中仍一遍遍回放着真嗣的告白。

_"…Would you believe me if I tell you I come from the future?"  
“……如果我说我来自未来，你会相信吗？”_

_Even though it sounded as unreal as saying the earth was flat to her, Asuka knew it was possibly the only logical explanation. Shoving her doubts aside, she decided to listen in.  
尽管这听起来如同告诉她地球是平的一样不真实，但明日香知道这可能是唯一合理的解释。她压下疑虑，决定仔细聆听。_

_"…SEELE, the people behind NERV…The third Impact happened…Human Instrumentality Project…Second Impact…Adam…Angels…"  
"…SEELE，操纵 NERV 的背后势力…第三次冲击发生了…人类补完计划…第二次冲击…亚当…使徒…"_

_As shocking as the information was, Asuka did her best not to show surprise. If anything, she only felt a deep sadness that, piloting the EVA, her life's purpose, was only to help the evil people commence their plan to end the world.  
尽管这些信息令人震惊，但明日香尽力不表现出惊讶。如果说有什么感觉的话，她只感到一种深深的悲哀，驾驶 EVA，她生命的意义，竟然只是帮助那些邪恶的人启动他们毁灭世界的计划。_

_"…I was somehow sent back in time after instrumentality…"  
"…在补完之后，我不知怎么地回到了过去…"_

_Asuka raised an eyebrow. If he had been through the Angel Wars before, then it must mean he had met other Asukas. She felt a seed of fear planted into her heart.  
明日香挑了挑眉。如果他经历过天使战争，那么他一定遇到过其他明日香。她感到心中种下了一颗恐惧的种子。_

_"Shinji…" She started, her voice dreary. "Did…did you…If you have been through all this…what happened to the other me?" She forced out as her body started to tremble slightly.  
“真嗣…”她开口，声音沉闷。“你…你…如果你经历了这一切…另一个我怎么样了？”她强忍着颤抖的身体问道。_

_She could hear Shinji let out a sigh. "Asuka…Remember the other girl I mentioned before?" Asuka nodded, before the dawning horror could strike her, though, Shinji spoke up.  
她能听到真嗣叹了口气。“明日香…记得我之前提到的那个女孩吗？”明日香点了点头，但就在惊恐袭来之前，真嗣开口了。_

_"She's you, Asuka." “她就是你，明日香。”_

_"And I failed her." "我辜负了她。"_

_As much as she had been expecting this, it didn't help her from feeling hurt. There was still another more vital question, though.  
尽管她对此早有预料，但这并未减轻她的伤痛。然而，还有一个更为关键的问题。_

_"Did...did you love her?"  
"你...你爱过她吗？"_

_Shinji fell silent. He knew what the consequences of telling her the truth would be, but he couldn't bring himself to lie to her, not after everything.  
真嗣沉默了。他知道告诉她真相的后果，但他无法在经历了这一切之后还对她撒谎。_

_"...Yes." "...是的。"_

_"That day...at the graveyard. You weren't talking about me, were you?"  
"那天...在墓地。你说的不是我，对吧？"_

_Silence. 沉默。_

_At that moment, Asuka felt something in her heart shattered.  
那一刻，明日香感到心中有什么东西破碎了。_

She had to hold back another wave of tears that suddenly threatened to spill out of her eyes. After all, Shinji, the boy she loved the most in the world, wasn't completely hers.  
她不得不强忍住又一波突然涌上眼眶的泪水。毕竟，真嗣，这个她全世界最爱的男孩，并不完全属于她。

Now that Shinji's strange behaviors made sense to her. He loved _her_ from the beginning.  
现在，真嗣那些奇怪的行为对她来说有了合理的解释。他从一开始就爱着她。

But was it acceptable? Now that Asuka knew Shinji didn't develop his love for her on _her_, but on other girls.  
但这是可以接受的吗？如今，明日香知道真嗣对她的爱并非源于她，而是源于其他女孩。

_"Whom you love is HER! Not me!"  
“你爱的那个人是她！不是我！”_

That day...when she heard him confess at the graveyard...the girl he loved more than anything else in the world...he didn't mean her, but _her._  
那天……当她在墓地听到他告白时……他深爱着这世上的一切……他指的并非是她，而是她。

A lie. 一个谎言。

One lie, the trust was broken.  
一个谎言，信任便已破碎。

Even though she knew that maybe, just maybe, Shinji didn't see her and the other Asukas differently, what she wanted was Shinji completely hers. She gave him all of her, her heart, her body, her soul.  
尽管她知道或许，仅仅是或许，真嗣并没有将她和另一个明日香区别对待，但她渴望的是真嗣完全属于她。她将她的全部，她的心，她的身体，她的灵魂，都给了他。

She chose him over her mother.  
她选择了他，而非她的母亲。

And it was a lie.  
而这，是个谎言。

That was only the best-case scenario she could come up with, though. What if he was only using her as a replacement, that he only saw her as his other chance to do everything right? What if…he only used her as a tool to achieve his own redemption?  
尽管那只是她能设想的最佳情况。如果他只是把她当作替代品，只把她视为他重新做对一切的另一次机会呢？如果……他只是利用她作为实现自我救赎的工具呢？

Even though there was a subtle part of her mind, telling her that Shinji didn't go for other girls than her, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was betrayed.  
尽管她内心深处有个细微的声音告诉她，真嗣除了她不会对其他女孩动心，但她就是无法摆脱被背叛的感觉。

"A-Asuka…" She could hear Shinji muttering her name and see him standing in the doorway as she entered the apartment. Without acknowledging his presence whatsoever, Asuka walked straight into her room.  
“A-明日香……”她能听到真嗣喃喃念着她的名字，看见他站在门口，而她走进了公寓。明日香丝毫没有理会他的存在，径直走向自己的房间。

After entering her bedroom and shut the door close behind her, she immediately pulled the promising ring off her finger and threw it on the wall with all of her might. Screaming a distorted scream, Asuka lunched at her drawer before finding and smashing everything Shinji related.  
一进卧室并关上门后，她立刻摘下那枚象征希望的戒指，用尽全力扔向墙壁。明日香尖叫着扑向抽屉，找到所有与真嗣相关的东西，然后一一砸碎。

"I hate you! I hate you!" Asuka continued to scream as she tore the wristband apart. She felt so stupid that she even needed it to get his attention. Looking back, the idiot was no other than herself.  
"我恨你！我恨你！" 明日香继续尖叫着，撕裂了手腕带。她觉得自己太愚蠢了，竟然需要它来引起他的注意。回想起来，那个傻瓜不是别人，正是她自己。

Shinji sat on the floor just outside, his back leaning against the wall, his expression mixed with remorse and pain as he heard the smashing noises and her distorted screams. Not because that Asuka was mad at him or anything; he just couldn't stand seeing her hurt so much, and hurt by him, no less.  
真嗣坐在门外地板上，背靠墙壁，表情混合着悔恨和痛苦，听着破碎声和她扭曲的尖叫。不是因为明日香生他的气或别的什么；他只是无法忍受看到她如此受伤，而且还是被他伤害。

"I hate you! I ha-" Asuka trailed off as she settled her eyes on the roll of paper she had carefully put into the deepest part of the drawer. With trembling hands, she rolled the paper open.  
"我恨你！我恨——" 明日香的声音渐渐消失，当她的目光落在她小心翼翼放入抽屉最深处的那卷纸上。她颤抖着手，展开了那张纸。

_Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷_

_Ich Liebe Shinji 我爱真嗣_

Asuka felt her knees wobble as she promptly fell back onto her bed. Burying her face in the pillow, she wept.  
明日香感到膝盖发软，随即跌坐在床上。她把脸埋进枕头里，哭泣起来。

"It's unfair! It's unfair…"  
“这不公平！这不公平……”

She still loved him. 她依然爱着他。

In fact, she loved him so much…  
事实上，她爱他爱得如此深…

And it only hurt more.  
而这只会让痛苦更甚。

Slowly, Asuka rose from the bed and headed to the door. Sliding the door open, Asuka could see Shinji sitting on the floor leaning against the wall. He snapped his head in her direction as he heard the noise. "Asuka…" He started, not sure what to say.  
慢慢地，明日香从床上起身，走向门口。她拉开房门，看到真嗣正坐在地板上，背靠着墙。听到声响，他猛地转头看向她。“明日香……”他开口道，却不知该说什么。

"Shinji, listen carefully…" Asuka spoke up, taking a deep breath and closing her eyes. "I…I will help you to fight SEELE…but after the battle, assuming that we'll win, of course, we're going on our separate ways." It ripped her heart apart to say this, but, she just had to think about things by herself before making other decisions.  
“真嗣，仔细听好……”明日香提高了声音，深吸一口气，闭上了眼睛。“我……我会帮你对抗 SEELE……但战斗结束后，如果我们赢了，当然，我们会各走各的路。”说出这话让她心如刀割，但她必须先独自思考，再做其他决定。

"Asuka…" Shinji stood up. As much as Asuka leaving him hurt him, as long as she felt it necessary, he was okay with that. No, he _had to_ be okay with it. "I'm sorry. I-" He instinctively reached out his hand to her.  
“明日香……”真嗣站了起来。尽管明日香离开他让他心痛，但只要她觉得有必要，他愿意接受。不，他必须接受。“对不起。我——”他本能地向她伸出手。

Just to be slapped away. "Don't touch me!" Asuka cried. "I… I'm going to the Geofront. I don't want to see you right now." With that, the redhead turned away and headed to the front door without looking back.  
只是被一把推开。“别碰我！”明日香哭喊道，“我……我要去地底都市。现在不想见到你。”说完，红发女孩转身离开，头也不回地走向前门。

Gendo Ikari stood in front of the gigantic tank in utter silence, holding a remote controller in his hand. Aside from the lights inside of the empty cylindrical tube in the center of the room, the only illumination to be found was the glowing green light from the screen of the remote control.  
碇源堂站在巨大的水槽前，一言不发，手中握着遥控器。除了房间中央空心圆柱管内的灯光外，唯一的光源便是遥控器屏幕发出的绿色光芒。

"I knew you'd come down here sooner than later." Gendo Ikari spoke as he heard faint footsteps coming close to him from behind. He knew there was something wrong when Shinji asked him to enact suicide watch on the Second Child, and when Section 2 reported that Pilot Soryu entered the Geofront alone in an agitated state only confirmed his assumptions. "What happened, Shinji? Between you and the Second Child?"  
“我知道你会比预期更早下来。”碇源堂听到身后传来轻微的脚步声，开口说道。当真嗣请求他对二号机驾驶员实施自杀监控时，他就察觉到不对劲，而第二课报告说惣流驾驶员独自情绪激动地进入地底都市，更证实了他的猜想。“发生了什么，真嗣？你和二号机驾驶员之间？”

"We had a fight." Shinji's sullen voice reached him. "Don't worry, we did this many times before." He let out a sad chuckle. In retrospect, of course, he could tell her everything right from the beginning. He did, several times, but they only turned out worse. It's just an inevitable doom for him. And even after so many times, he still found himself unable to find a perfect solution.  
“我们吵架了。” 真嗣闷闷不乐的声音传到他耳中。“别担心，我们以前也这样过很多次。”他苦笑了一下。回想起来，当然，他本可以从一开始就把一切都告诉她。他确实试过几次，但结果总是更糟。对他来说，这似乎是不可避免的命运。即便经历了这么多次，他发现自己仍然无法找到一个完美的解决办法。

"The end is near, anyway." Gendo's voice remained calm. "I can only wish you good luck with her in the future."  
“反正结局已经近在眼前了。” 碇源堂的声音依旧平静。“我只能祝愿你未来和她在一起时好运。”

Even though he didn't make it clear, Shinji could still get the meaning behind the curtain. After all, his father still wanted his own version of Instrumentality, which he implied would be 'good luck in your next cycle'.  
尽管他没有明说，真嗣还是能领会到幕后的含义。毕竟，他的父亲依然想要实现他自己版本的“人类补完计划”，这暗示着“祝你在下一个轮回中好运”。

It wasn't necessarily a bad ending, though. Dead by Instrumentality wasn't the worst way to die for Asuka – in fact, it would probably be the best way. It was quick and painless, and she could see her mother in the end.  
这并不一定是个糟糕的结局。对于明日香来说，通过人类补完计划而死并非最坏的死法——事实上，这可能是最好的方式。它迅速而无痛苦，最终她还能见到母亲。

What more could he wish for? He should be grateful that he didn't get her killed during the Angel Wars, right? And making sure she wouldn't die fighting the MP EVAs was the final thing he needed to do.  
他还能奢望什么呢？他应该庆幸在使徒战争中没有让她丧命，对吧？确保她不会在与 MP EVA 的战斗中死去，是他最后需要做的事情。

"What are you doing here, father?" Shinji started after a moment of silence between them. "It took me some time to find you."  
“你在这里做什么，父亲？”沉默片刻后，真嗣开口问道，“我花了一些时间才找到你。”

"It's about Yui," Gendo spoke, his one hand behind his rear, the other gripping the remote control tightly. "How many times have you met a new Second Child?"  
"是关于 Yui 的，" Gendo 说道，一只手背在身后，另一只手紧紧握着遥控器。"你见过几次新的二号适格者？"

Shinji's eyebrows raised. He wasn't expecting him to ask him about that. Though after seeing that his father could actually show care, nothing else was odder coming from him. "Not gonna lie, I can't remember it myself."  
Shinji 的眉毛扬了起来。他没想到父亲会问这个。尽管看到父亲竟然能表现出关心，其他任何事情从他嘴里说出来都不再奇怪了。"说实话，我自己也记不清了。"

"What do you think of her every time?"  
"每次见到她，你有什么感觉？"

"I…I don't see them differently." Shinji replied, walking up next to his father. "They are all Asuka to me. I want to be together with her, yes. But I also need her help every time. Even though I try my best to make her happy every time…it still feels like I'm using her as a tool."  
"我……我对她们没有不同的看法。" 真嗣回答道，走到父亲身边。"她们对我来说都是明日香。我想和她在一起，是的。但每次我也需要她的帮助。尽管我尽力每次都让她开心……但感觉上我还是把她当作工具在使用。"

"Hm." Gendo pondered for a moment before putting his fingers on the black remote. With the press of the button, orange lights illuminated the borders of the dark, circular room. Around the perimeter of the room was a gigantic tank that held tons of LCL. Inside it were numerous human silhouettes that floated lifelessly around the orange liquid.  
"嗯。" 碇源堂沉思片刻后，将手指放在黑色遥控器上。按下按钮，橙色的灯光照亮了黑暗圆形房间的边缘。房间的四周是一个巨大的水槽，里面装满了 LCL。在橙色的液体中，无数的人形轮廓无生气地漂浮着。

The clones of Rei Ayanami.  
绫波零的克隆体。

The only thing that differentiated the vessels from the actual Rei Ayanami was that the wide, crimson eyes remained void of any spark, any sign of a soul behind them. They just idly floated inside of the LCL, staring into the center of the room as though it was their only purpose in existence.  
这些容器与真正的绫波零唯一的区别在于，那双宽大的深红色眼睛依旧空洞无光，没有任何灵魂的迹象。它们只是懒洋洋地漂浮在 LCL 中，凝视着房间的中心，仿佛这就是它们存在的唯一目的。

"I created them in an attempt to get Yui back as you should've known." Gendo narrowed his eyes at the lifeless vessels. "Are you making all of this effort to just…get the Second Child back? Or to be with her? Even if you keep failing?"  
“我创造它们是为了试图找回唯，你应该知道这一点。”碇源堂对那些无生命的容器眯起了眼睛。“你这么努力，只是为了……找回二号机驾驶员？还是为了和她在一起？即使你一再失败？”

Shinji chuckled. "I don't exactly have a choice. All I can do is to make her happy, at least before it all ends."  
真嗣轻笑道：“我没有选择。我所能做的，就是在一切结束之前，至少让她快乐。”

"You're right. You don't have a choice, but I do." Gendo said as he pressed another button, causing the pool of LCL to bubble. Turning around to see what was going on, Shinji watched as the numerous Rei clones began to breakdown before his very eyes, dissolving into the LCL.  
"你说得对。你别无选择，但我有。" 源堂说着又按下一个按钮，让 LCL 池开始冒泡。真嗣转过身来，目睹着众多绫波零的克隆体在他眼前开始分解，溶解进 LCL 中。

"Father…why? Wouldn't this introduce risk to your scenario?" The frown on his face said louder than any words about how he felt about his father's actions.  
"父亲……为什么？这样做不会给你的计划带来风险吗？" 他脸上的皱眉比任何言语都更强烈地表达了他对父亲行为的不满。

"They are never going to be Yui."  
"她们永远不可能成为唯。"

Shinji's eyes went wide. 真嗣的眼睛瞪大了。

_I'm not her! 我不是她！_

"The Angels are all dead, anyway. Keeping the tools I made from Yui serves no purpose." Gendo began walking away from the tanks. "Come one, Shinji. Back to my office."  
“反正天使们都死了，留着我为 Yui 制作的工具也没什么意义。” 碇源堂开始从水槽旁走开。“走吧，真嗣。回我办公室。”

The said boy followed closely behind his father as the duo made their way back to the upper level of NERV HQ. Shinji deemed they still had a lot of time before the start of the invasion – SEELE would have their final meeting with his father, and then it would be the hacking attempt of the MAGI.  
那个男孩紧跟在他父亲身后，两人一起返回 NERV 总部的高层。真嗣认为他们还有足够的时间，直到入侵开始——SEELE 会与他的父亲进行最后的会议，然后就是 MAGI 系统的黑客攻击。

"I've done my best to impede the development process of the Dummy Plug System." Gendo started as they rode the elevator upward. "Now it's all up to you."  
"我已经尽力阻碍 Dummy Plug 系统的开发进程了。" 碇源堂在他们乘坐电梯上升时开口说道，"现在一切都取决于你了。"

"I know." Shinji sighed. Was he actually going to fight off SEELE as long as possible to let his father initiate the Third Impact of his own version? It might be the best, though, since if they couldn't defeat the MP EVAs, Asuka would likely suffer a more brutal death. For now, he just needed to let everything flow naturally. "I'll do my best. I have an active S2 engine in Unit 01, maybe I can pull this off."  
"我知道。" 真嗣叹了口气。他真的要尽可能长时间地抵抗 SEELE，让父亲启动他自己的第三次冲击版本吗？这可能是最好的选择，因为如果他们不能击败 MP EVA，明日香很可能会遭受更残酷的死亡。目前，他只需要让一切自然发展。"我会尽力的。初号机里有活跃的 S2 引擎，也许我能成功。"

"I'm sure you will-" Gendo trailed off as every alarm inside the Geofront started to blare all at once.  
"我相信你一定能——" 碇源堂话音未落，地底都市内的所有警报突然同时响起。

_"Every personnel report to your positions! Level one battle stations! I repeat, this is not a drill!"  
"全体人员立即就位！一级战斗准备！重复，这不是演习！"_

Both of Gendo and Shinji's eyes went wide. The elevator ride to their destination level would still take a few minutes at least. Gendo reacted first as he punched the button to a new level.  
碇源堂和真嗣的眼睛都瞪大了。到达目的地的电梯还需要几分钟。碇源堂最先反应过来，他按下了前往新楼层的按钮。

"Father?" Shinji raised his eyebrow as he saw the level to the EVA cages lit up. "Aren't you going to-"  
"父亲？" 真嗣扬起眉毛，看到前往 EVA 格纳库的楼层亮起。"你不打算去-"

Gendo cut him off. "Let's get you into Unit 01 first."  
源堂打断了他。“先让你进入初号机再说。”

**Chapter 42: Requests 第 42 章：请求**

Inside the darkened room of Chairman Keel's office, the elderly man looked up at the eleven monoliths circled out before him. They had been discussing their plans to commence the Human Instrumentality Project by overthrowing NERV HQ since the defeat of the Seventeenth Angel. While they had been planning to have a last talk with Gendo, truly hoping that he would give up the EVAs himself, the information obtained by the last Angel had reduced all of their hopes into dust.  
在基尔议长办公室的昏暗房间内，这位老人抬头看着面前环绕的十一座巨碑。自从第十七使徒战败以来，他们一直在讨论通过推翻 NERV 总部来启动人类补完计划的计划。尽管他们曾计划与碇源堂进行最后一次谈话，真心希望他能主动放弃 EVA，但最后一使徒获得的信息将他们所有的希望化为了泡影。

Even though Keel had been constantly frustrated with Commander Ikari - especially the development of the dummy plug system - he actually carried a note of respect toward him. He never thought Gendo would dare, and did pull off the stunt, deceiving the entire SEELE committee until the last moment.  
尽管基尔一直对碇司令感到沮丧——尤其是傀儡系统的开发——他实际上对他抱有一丝敬意。他从没想到碇源堂敢这么做，并且确实在最后一刻欺骗了整个 SEELE 委员会。

"Commander Ikari has left us with no choice." SEELE 01 let out, looking up at the monoliths of his fellow SEELE members. "We have failed to weaken the capabilities of NERV through the last Angel, though the intelligence he sent us is valuable."  
"司令碇源堂已迫使我們別無選擇。" SEELE 01 說道，抬頭望向其他 SEELE 成員的巨大石碑。"我們未能通過最後的使徒削弱 NERV 的能力，儘管他傳遞給我們的情報極具價值。"

"Indeed. It seems like force is the only way to achieve our goal." SEELE 03 spoke.  
"確實。看來武力是達成我們目標的唯一途徑。" SEELE 03 說道。"

"The evacuation of Tokyo-3 is already completed. Our troops will be able to travel through the area freely, and fire without restraint." SEELE 05 added. It wasn't like they cared about the lives of the civilians; they would all die in the end, anyway.  
"東京-3 的疏散已經完成。我們的部隊將能自由穿越該區域，並無所顧忌地開火。" SEELE 05 補充道。他們並不在乎平民的性命；反正他們最終都會死去。"

"The MP EVAs are still in subpar states. The S2 engines are still underdeveloped." SEELE 07 grumbled. "If Ikari would give us the sample of the S2 engine from the Fourth Angel, everything wouldn't be so bad."  
“MP 型 EVA 状态依旧不佳，S2 引擎也尚未成熟。”SEELE 07 抱怨道，“如果碇能交出第四使徒的 S2 引擎样本，一切就不会这么糟糕了。”

"That's why we built twelve of them, and we need to begin the invasion as a surprise." Keel continued. "Inform the JSSDF to begin their assault on NERV Headquarters." He took a deep breath then let out a sigh. "Kill every moving object on sight, including the pilots. Leave none alive."  
“这就是我们建造了十二台的原因，我们需要以突袭的方式开始入侵。”基尔继续说道，“通知日本自卫队，对 NERV 总部发起攻击。”他深吸一口气，然后叹息道，“见活动之物，格杀勿论，包括驾驶员，一个不留。”

Asuka looked down at the controls of Unit 02 with her single eye, taking deep breaths, trying to clear the emotional turmoil in her. Even though the briefing of the situation was rather general, she had already obtained a more detailed version through Shinji, disturbing as it was. If she didn't kill the attackers first, the world would end. Asuka tried to tell herself that she was only doing it for herself so that she could live through the end, but not for the sake of the person who dared to betray her.  
明日香单眼凝视着二号机的控制面板，深呼吸试图平复内心的波澜。尽管情况简报相当笼统，但她已从真嗣那里得知了更详细的版本，令人不安。如果不先消灭攻击者，世界将走向终结。明日香试图说服自己，她这么做只是为了自己能在这场末日中存活，而非为了那个胆敢背叛她的人。

She had to hold back another sudden urge of crying as she thought about him. Shinji hadn't come to the EVA cages yet, though she tried to not care about it. She was Asuka Langley Soryu in the first place, she can prove that she could do this all by herself. So what if Shinji wouldn't help her? She bet since she broke up with him, Shinji wanted nothing to do with her anymore as well. If anything, he would definitely want this world to end as fast as possible so he could quickly lay his evil hands on another Asuka.  
每当想起他，她都不得不强忍住再次涌上心头的哭泣冲动。真嗣还没有来到 EVA 笼前，尽管她试图不去在意。毕竟，她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，她能证明自己完全可以独自完成这一切。就算真嗣不帮忙又怎样？她敢打赌，自从分手后，真嗣也巴不得与她撇清关系。如果有什么的话，他肯定巴不得这个世界尽快结束，好让他那双邪恶的手迅速伸向另一个明日香。

And it only infuriated her even more.  
这只会让她更加愤怒。

"I'll show you, Ikari." Asuka snarled. "I'll show you that I don't need you!"  
“我会证明给你看，碇。”明日香咆哮道，“我会证明我不需要你！”

Despite the gravity of the situation, she found herself oddly calm, save for the emotional hurricane caused by Shinji. She had been through so much up to this point that a few men in army tanks were nothing to her. She had killed extraterrestrial creatures that could endure a whole N2 blast and continued walking like it was nothing. A few tanks and LFVs were nothing compared to them.  
尽管情况严峻，她却发现自己异常平静，除了因真嗣而引发的情绪风暴。她经历了如此之多，以至于几辆坦克对她来说根本不算什么。她曾杀死过能承受整个 N2 爆炸并继续行走的外星生物。与它们相比，几辆坦克和 LFV 根本不值一提。

Taking in a deep breath before the pool of LCL started to flood her entry plug, she danced her fingers across the control panel and began the activation process.  
在 LCL 开始淹没她的插入栓之前，她深吸一口气，手指在控制面板上舞动，启动了激活程序。

"...A-10 connections established."  
“...A-10 连接已建立。”

With a loud hum, the crimson Evangelion came to life as its four green eyes lit up. Over the comm channel, she could hear Maya's voice as she checked off all of Unit 02's readings before giving the go-ahead for launch. "Asuka, please be careful out there. Okay?" The timid woman's already soft tone was even smaller and quieter than usual.  
随着一声响亮的嗡鸣，赤红的福音战士启动了，四只绿色的眼睛随之亮起。通讯频道中，她能听到玛雅的声音，她正在逐一确认 02 号机的各项读数，然后给出启动的许可。“明日香，请在外面小心点。好吗？”这位本就胆怯的女性，声音比平时更加细小和轻柔。

"I'll be fine." She deadpanned. "In fact, I think you guys should make sure to stay safe yourself." If Shinji was correct, the JSSDF troops would make sure there were no survivors.  
“我会没事的。”她面无表情地说道。“事实上，我觉得你们自己也要确保安全。”如果真嗣的判断没错，JSSDF 的部队会确保不留活口。

"No worries." This time, though, Maya's voice gained a note of determination in it. "EVA launch!"  
“不用担心。”这一次，玛雅的声音中多了一丝坚定。“EVA 启动！”

Asuka looked up at the series of tunnels as she and Unit 02 was shot up to the surface of the Geofront. "I'll show you, bastard Shinji!" She growled, waiting for the darkness to turn to light as she was quickly lifted to the surface.  
明日香抬头望着一系列隧道，她和二号机被射向地表。“我会让你见识到的，混蛋真嗣！”她咆哮着，等待黑暗转为光明，迅速被提升到地面。

The second Unit 02 emerged onto the surface, all of the JSSDF's forces quickly locked onto the crimson EVA and opened fire onto it before it could even move. Asuka flinched as the rain of shells and missiles smashed into the mech, but did little more than that. Conventional weapons were barely able to make a small scratch on the fortified armor on the Evangelions, let alone piercing its AT-Field.  
二号机一出现在地表，JSSDF 的所有部队迅速锁定这架红色 EVA 并开火，使其几乎无法移动。明日香在炮弹和导弹的暴雨中畏缩了一下，但这仅此而已。常规武器几乎无法在强化装甲的福音战士上留下划痕，更不用说穿透其 AT 力场了。

And all they did to Asuka was to piss her off even more.  
而这一切只是让明日香更加愤怒。

"What the hell was that supposed to be?! It's itchy!" She laughed maniacally as she willed for Unit 02 to begin moving. Leaping into the air, the colossal EVA Unit smashed its metal feet onto a series of tanks, howitzers, and rocket launchers, flattening them into piles of scorched metal junk.  
"这到底是什么鬼东西？！痒死了！" 她狂笑着，催动二号机开始行动。巨大的 EVA 单位一跃而起，用金属脚掌猛击一连串的坦克、榴弹炮和火箭发射器，将它们压成一堆堆烧焦的金属废料。

After regaining her balance and destroying another squadron of military vehicles, Asuka caught sight of a barrage of missiles heading her way. Grinning a twisted grin, Asuka swiped her hand with all of her might; with a loud sonic boom the EVA's hand swiped across the air, the shockwave knocking every missile off course.  
在恢复平衡并摧毁另一支军队车队后，明日香瞥见一排导弹向她袭来。她扭曲地咧嘴一笑，用尽全力挥动手臂；随着一声巨响，EVA 的手在空中划过，冲击波将所有导弹偏离了轨道。

"Don't sass me!" She cackled as she saw the missiles exploded upon contacting the gourd around her, the fireballs engulfed numerous fighter vehicles.  
"别跟我顶嘴！" 她咯咯笑着，看到导弹在接触到她周围的葫芦时爆炸，火球吞噬了众多战斗机车。

"Now you've got my attention!" Sprinting towards the rocket launchers and missile trucks that dared to open fire onto her, Asuka's blood-thirsty grin grew wider as she saw the looks of fear on the soldier's faces. It wasn't like she enjoyed killing humans, but she _did_ enjoy making her enemy fear her as they should.  
"现在你引起了我的注意！" 阿斯卡朝着那些胆敢向她开火的火箭发射器和导弹卡车疾驰而去，她嗜血的笑容在看到士兵们脸上的恐惧时愈发扩大。她并不喜欢杀戮人类，但她确实享受让敌人像他们应该的那样惧怕她。

"General!" A soldier screamed at the man beside him while they both ducked behind a tank, hoping the war machine could provide cover to the rain of flaming debris. "What are we going to do?!"  
"将军！" 一名士兵对着他身旁的人尖叫，两人都躲在一辆坦克后，希望这台战争机器能提供掩护，抵挡那如雨般燃烧的碎片。"我们该怎么办？！"

Narrowing his eyes, the General glared at the crimson death machine as it jumped down from the air, flattening another squadron of tanks and LFVs. He caught sight of a long cable-like appendage sprouting from its back, leading to the elevator from which it came. "The cable." He spoke into the walkie-talkie, looking at the thick wire protruding from its back. "Sever the cable!"  
将军眯起眼睛，瞪着那台从空中跃下、碾平另一支坦克和 LFV 中队的猩红死神。他注意到一条长长的电缆状附属物从它的背部伸出，通向它来的电梯。"电缆。" 他对着对讲机说道，目光锁定在那根从它背部突出的粗电线。"切断电缆！"

"Roger." The soldier nodded, raising the microphone up to his mouth. "All forces, target the umbilical cable!"  
“罗杰。”士兵点头，将麦克风举到嘴边。“所有单位，瞄准脐带电缆！”

As much as the JSSDF was no match against the Evangelions, their military training was still strict and professional. Without any delay between the command and the action, every single tank that was still operational turned their turrets towards the exposed cord and unanimously opened fire onto it, severing her connection to the infinite power source NERV provided her with.  
尽管日本自卫队无法与使徒抗衡，但他们的军事训练依然严格而专业。命令与行动之间毫无延迟，所有仍在运作的坦克立即将炮塔转向暴露的电缆，一致开火，切断了她与 NERV 提供的无限能源的连接。

"Tch." Asuka huffed as she saw the five-minute timer started counting down. "It doesn't matter. Five minutes is more than enough time to kill all of you!" She screamed, punting a truck across the Geofront and sending it crashing into the wall, bursting into a ball of fire.  
“啧。”明日香看到五分钟倒计时开始，不屑地哼了一声。“没关系。五分钟足够杀光你们所有人！”她尖叫着，一脚将一辆卡车踢飞，撞向地下城的墙壁，引发了一场大火球。

The General shook his head as he watched the Evangelion continue on its vicious thrashing of the JSSDF forces. He had thought severing the cable would put the EVA to a stop immediately, but now it seemed like it was a miscalculation on his side.  
将军摇了摇头，看着福音战士继续对自卫队进行猛烈的攻击。他原以为切断电缆会立即让 EVA 停止行动，但现在看来这是他的一个误判。

Letting out a sigh, the General pulled out his intercom and spoke into the microphone. "Call the bombers. Commence Operation Silent Spring."  
将军叹了口气，拿出对讲机对着麦克风说道：“呼叫轰炸机。开始执行‘无声春天’行动。”

Within a matter of seconds, all fire came to a halt, and the JSSDF troops quickly retreated from the battlefield. Asuka took no time to realize what this meant, recalling Shinji's description of the direction of the battle. "Shit!" She hissed before quickly ducking down her EVA and raised her AT-Field.  
短短几秒钟内，所有火力都停止了，自卫队士兵迅速从战场上撤退。明日香立刻意识到这意味着什么，回想起真嗣对战斗方向的描述。“该死！”她低声咒骂，随即迅速蹲下 EVA 并展开了 AT 力场。

A violent jarring rumble shook her entire EVA Unit, knocking it off of its feet and onto the ground as a brilliant white light shone above her. Even from behind the protection provided by her AT-Field, Asuka could still feel the searing heat that threatened to cook her alive. As the light and heat dissipated, Asuka reopened her eye and saw a gigantic hole on the roof of the Geofront.  
一阵剧烈的震动猛烈摇撼了她的 EVA 机体，使其失去平衡摔倒在地，同时一道耀眼的白光在她上方闪耀。即便有 AT 力场的保护，明日香仍能感受到那股足以将她活活烤熟的灼热。当光芒和热浪散去，明日香重新睁开眼，看到地底都市的屋顶上出现了一个巨大的洞口。

"Asuka," Maya's voice rang through her ears once again. "They just dropped an N2 mine on us!"  
“明日香，”玛雅的声音再次在她耳边响起，“他们刚刚向我们投下了一枚 N2 地雷！”

"I saw it." Asuka huffed before the beeping sound of her radar caught her attention. "And there's more behind it!"  
“我看到了。”明日香喘息着，随即雷达的哔哔声引起了她的注意，“而且后面还有更多！”

Asuka glared at the sky as the sound of roaring jet engines boomed across the air while twelve large V-shaped aircraft soared over the Geofront, each craft carrying some sort of strange figure on its belly.  
明日香瞪着天空，随着轰鸣的喷气发动机声响彻空中，十二架巨大的 V 形飞行器在第三新东京市上空翱翔，每架飞行器的腹部都载有一个奇怪的图案。

"Why are there twelve of them?!" Asuka exclaimed in surprise. Shinji had told her there would be nine.  
“为什么有十二架？！”明日香惊呼道。真嗣告诉她会有九架的。

It didn't really matter, though. She knew she had to destroy every single of them, and from Shinji, she knew that these EVA Units weren't easy to deal with as they all carried an S2 engine that basically provided them infinite power. They weren't entirely invincible, though. All she needed to do was to make sure the cores were destroyed.  
不过，这并不重要。她知道她必须摧毁它们每一个，而且从真嗣那里她了解到，这些 EVA 单位并不容易对付，因为它们都装备了 S2 引擎，基本上提供了无限动力。尽管如此，它们并非完全无敌。她只需要确保核心被摧毁即可。

Inside of the Command Center, Fuyutsuki narrowed his eyes. "They're sending the MP EVAs here?" He murmured to himself. "They couldn't possibly be planning to…" Leaning forward into the microphone, the Sub-Commander called out to the pilot of Unit 02. "Pilot Soryu, retreat now. Wait until Pilot Ikari gets to Unit 01 before engaging."  
在指挥中心内部，冬月眯起了眼睛。“他们要把 MP EVA 派到这里来？”他喃喃自语，“他们不可能打算……”副司令向前倾身，对着麦克风向 02 号机驾驶员喊话。“绫波零，立即撤退。等待碇真嗣到达 01 号机后再进行交战。”

"Why would I do that?!" She snapped, not really caring about etiquettes anymore. "Three and a half minutes are more than enough to kill all of them!"  
“我为什么要这么做？！”她厉声反问，不再顾及礼仪。“三分钟半足够我干掉他们所有人了！”

And most importantly, she didn't want to need him. Not anymore.  
最重要的是，她不想再需要他了。不再需要。

"Fine." Fuyutsuki nodded in reluctant agreement.  
“好吧。”冬月不情愿地点头同意。

"I'll try not to have too much fun." The redhead smirked, tightening the grip on her controls as the winged beasts lowered themselves onto the ground, pulling their wings inside of their bodies and brandishing their large, dual-bladed swords.  
“我会尽量不玩得太开心。”红发女孩微微一笑，握紧操纵杆，那些长着翅膀的怪兽降落在地面上，收起翅膀，挥舞着它们巨大的双刃剑。

Asuka made a twisted smile as she locked her sights onto the EVA Unit that made the first landing of the group. All twelve MP EVA Units made a sick grin, exposing their white teeth under their fire lips.  
明日香露出了扭曲的笑容，将目光锁定在第一个着陆的 EVA 单位上。所有十二台 MP EVA 单位都露出了病态的笑容，在火焰般的嘴唇下露出洁白的牙齿。

Without giving them any time to prepare, Asuka controlled Unit 02 to lunge forward and smashed its gigantic fists directly into the metal skull of the leader of the group, shattering the top of its cranium before tons of LCL burst out of the EVA's head, its body fell limp instantly.  
不给对方任何准备时间，明日香操控着二号机猛地前冲，巨大的拳头直接砸向领头者的金属头骨，将其颅顶击碎，随即大量 LCL 从 EVA 头部喷涌而出，其身体瞬间瘫软。

It wasn't the end, though. Remembering what Shinji had told her about their capabilities, Asuka robbed its dual-edged blade and threw it at the core of the white EVA. Just as she had expected, the blade morphed into the shape of Lance of Longinus before impacting, piercing through the core without resistance.  
但这并未结束。想起真嗣曾告诉她的关于它们的能力，明日香夺过其双刃剑，朝着白色 EVA 的核心投掷过去。正如她所料，剑在空中变形为朗基努斯之枪的形状，毫无阻碍地贯穿了核心。

One down, eleven to go.  
一个倒下，还有十一个。

"We're here." Gendo Ikari stood in front of two elevators alongside Shinji, his expression determined. "You will go to the EVA cages using the elevator on the right side. I will go down Central Dogma with the left."  
"我们到了。" 碇源堂站在两部电梯前，与真嗣并肩，神情坚定。"你将使用右侧的电梯前往 EVA 格纳库。我将通过左侧的电梯前往中央教条。"

Letting out a sigh, Gendo started walking slowly toward the elevator. A small part of him was screaming at him to not do this, that he should help his son and give him a brighter future, preferably with the Second Child. However, this small voice was overwhelmed by the torrent of anticipation and desire to reunite with Yui.  
叹了口气，碇源堂缓缓走向电梯。内心有一小部分在尖叫，告诉他不要这么做，他应该帮助他的儿子，给他一个更光明的未来，最好是有第二适格者相伴。然而，这微弱的声音被渴望与唯重逢的期待和欲望的洪流所淹没。

"You should start moving. She's fighting there outside alone." Gendo said with a slightly confused expression as he didn't notice Shinji moving. Turning his head back, his eyes widened a bit as he saw two JSSDF soldiers just cut the corner, raising their rifles at them as they came into their field of view.  
"你应该开始行动了。她在外面独自战斗。" 碇源堂带着一丝困惑的表情说道，因为他没注意到真嗣在动。当他回头时，他的眼睛微微睁大，因为他看到两名 JSSDF 士兵刚刚转过拐角，举起他们的步枪对准他们，进入了他们的视野。

_BANG BANG BANG 砰砰砰_

One absolute advantage of being professionally trained was that Gendo could fire his own pistol at the soldiers before they pulled the trigger. The two JSSDF soldiers promptly fell to the ground under Gendo's sharpshooting skills, blood starting to spread on the floor.  
作为一名受过专业训练的人，Gendo 的一个绝对优势是他能在士兵们扣动扳机之前先开枪射击。两名 JSSDF 士兵随即在 Gendo 的精准射击下倒地，鲜血开始在地板上蔓延。

"Let's go," Gendo said. “我们走，”Gendo 说道。

"Father…" Shinji's voice turned horrified as he settled his eyes on him. Following the direction of his fingers, Gendo looked down at himself.  
"父亲……" 真嗣的声音变得惊恐，当他将目光投向他时。顺着他的手指方向，源渡低头看向自己。

Just saw a medium-sized bullet wound on his right chest, blood dripping out like a running stream.  
只见右胸上有一个中等大小的枪伤，鲜血如溪流般滴落。

Suddenly he felt his knees wobble as he fell back-first to the floor, unable to move his muscles again. Feeling his breaths were becoming increasingly difficult, Gendo knew there wasn't much time left him.  
突然间，他感到膝盖发软，仰面倒在地上，肌肉再也无法动弹。感觉到呼吸越来越困难，源渡知道留给他的时间不多了。

"Sh-Shinji," He called out in a weak voice. The said boy turned to him and knelt down, his expression an unreadable mixture.  
"真-真嗣," 他用微弱的声音呼唤道。那男孩转过身来，跪下，表情难以捉摸。

Shinji didn't make any remark. Instead, he just looked at him in silence.  
真嗣没有发表任何评论。他只是默默地看着他。

"Perhaps this sounds absurd…but I abandoned you because I didn't want to hurt you. All I do is cause you pain."  
"也许这听起来很荒谬……但我离开你是因为我不想伤害你。我所做的只会给你带来痛苦。"

Maybe it was the truth, but this time…  
或许那是真相，但这一次……

"I'm sorry, Shinji." “对不起，真嗣。”

He knew it was the end for him. He still had a lot of things to say to Shinji, but time wasn't in favor of him.  
他明白自己已到尽头。他还有许多话想对真嗣说，但时间已不再眷顾他。

"Can you forgive me, Shinji?"  
"你能原谅我吗，真嗣？"

Shinji's lips twitched. "Father…I cannot, and will never forgive Gendo Ikari." He let a moment of silence hung between them before speaking up again. "But…I think I can forgive _you._"  
真嗣的嘴唇微微抽动。"父亲……我无法，也永远不会原谅碇源堂。"他让沉默在他们之间停留了一会儿，然后再次开口。"但是……我想我可以原谅你。"

Gendo Ikari closed his eyes, for the first time since Yui died, a genuine smile grew on his face. "Now…go to her…before it's too late…" Before Shinji could answer, though, he added. "And please…bring me to Yui…" With a trembling arm, Gendo raised his hand with all of his remaining strength and handed Shinji the embryo of Adam.  
碇源堂闭上了眼睛，自唯去世以来，他的脸上第一次绽放出真心的微笑。"现在……去她那里吧……趁还来得及……"在真嗣回答之前，他又补充道。"还有……请带我去见唯……"碇源堂颤抖着，用尽他仅存的力量举起手，将亚当的胚胎递给了真嗣。

Shinji nodded and took the embryo from him. Even though the promise was fake, he felt it was the last thing he could do for him. "See you on the other side…"  
真嗣点点头，从他手中接过胚胎。尽管这个承诺是假的，但他觉得这是自己能为对方做的最后一件事。“在那边见…”

With that, he quickly stood up and turned to the elevator. The door opened with a soft sliding sound, and Shinji entered the box without looking back.  
说完，他迅速站起身，转向电梯。门轻轻滑开，真嗣没有回头，径直走进了电梯。

"Yui…will we meet again?"  
“唯…我们还会再见吗？”

"Die, you bastard!" Asuka shrieked, tackling one of the EVAs into the giant artificial lake, strangling it while she held it underwater. Then, opening her right shoulder pylon, she grabbed her progressive knife and struck down onto the Evangelion's grotesque face. After the white EVA's body fell limp, she then pulled the knife out of its skull, and stabbed it right into its core. The core cracked, but her knife also broke. Discarding the handle of the broken blade, Asuka raised her fist and slammed it into the core. It finally shattered after a dozen of ground-breaking punches.  
"去死吧，混蛋！" 明日香尖叫着，将一台 EVA 扑入巨大的人工湖中，将其按在水下窒息。随后，她打开右肩的炮塔，取出高频粒子刀，猛地刺向那台 EVA 丑陋的面孔。待白色 EVA 的身体瘫软后，她拔出刀刃，直插其核心。核心裂开，但她的刀也断了。丢弃断刃的刀柄，明日香挥拳猛击核心，经过十几记重拳，核心终于破碎。

Turning around, Asuka caught sight of two of the MP EVAs closing in on her, their dual-bladed weapons ready. The first went for a low swing, which Unit 02 was easily able to leap over and counter by slamming its foot down onto the blade, knocking it out of her opponent's hand. She then used the dropped blade to counter the attack from the second one; shockwaves exploded as the blade collided with each other.  
转身之际，明日香瞥见两台量产型 EVA 正逼近，双刃武器蓄势待发。第一台 EVA 低扫而来，02 号机轻松跃起避开，并一脚踩在刀刃上，将其踢飞出对手的手中。接着，她利用掉落的刀刃反击第二台 EVA 的攻击；刀刃相撞，激起阵阵冲击波。

Screaming, Asuka made a giant horizontal cleave with the blade, cutting through both of the EVA's standing before them, bisecting them at the waist, drenching the surrounding area with blood-red LCL. After making sure that their cores were broken, Asuka counted, "Four down, eight to go."  
尖叫着，明日香挥动刀刃，进行了一次巨大的横向斩击，将面前两台 EVA 齐腰斩断，鲜红的 LCL 浸透了周围区域。确认了它们的核心被破坏后，明日香数道：“四个解决了，还有八个。”

The young Rei Ayanami gazed up at the great, white, masked creature that was Lilith. Or so she thought. Was she a part of Lilith, a creation of Lilith, or something else? The Fifth Child's words still rang in her ears.  
年轻的绫波零抬头凝视着那巨大的、白色的、戴着面具的生物——莉莉丝。或者她以为是这样。她是莉莉丝的一部分，莉莉丝的创造物，还是别的什么？第五适格者的话语仍在她耳边回响。

Was she destined to return to Lilith, like the spawn of Adam was destined to return to Adam?  
她是否注定要回到莉莉丝身边，就像亚当的子嗣注定要回到亚当那里一样？

Truthfully, she didn't know.  
老实说，她不知道。

"I've been waiting here for a while." A familiar female voice echoed throughout the chamber, prompting Rei to turn around to the source of the voice. Before her stood the faux blonde on the platform they shared. "I was wondering what was taking you so long."  
"我在这里等了一会儿了。"一个熟悉的女声在大厅中回荡，促使丽转身寻找声音的来源。站在她面前的是与她共享平台的假金发女子。"我在想你为什么这么久还没到。"

"Dr. Akagi, I do not understand." Rei's ghostly voice joined. "What are you waiting for?"  
"赤城博士，我不明白。"丽那幽灵般的声音加入。"你在等什么？"

The blonde doctor turned around, her eyes went wide as she set her eyes on Rei." Wait, where's Gendo?"  
金发女医生转过身来，一看到丽，她的眼睛就瞪大了。“等等，碇司令呢？”

"I cannot sense Commander Ikari's light of soul as of now. Therefore, I conclude he is likely dead." Her reply came out calmly.  
“我现在无法感知到碇司令的灵魂之光。因此，我得出结论，他很可能已经死亡。”她的回答平静如水。

Dr. Akagi found herself at a loss for words. She had been preparing for this moment for so long – the reprogramming of the MAGI system, getting down here undiscovered. And in the end, it was all futile.  
赤木律子博士发现自己无言以对。她为这一刻准备了太久——重编程 MAGI 系统，秘密潜入这里。而最终，这一切都变得毫无意义。

Though she wasn't going to complain.  
虽然她并不打算抱怨。

"What will happen if I return to Lilith?" Suddenly Rei spoke up, her voice slightly curious.  
“如果我回到莉莉丝身边会发生什么？”突然，丽突然开口，声音中带着一丝好奇。

"There's no Adam, nothing will happen." Ritsuko shrugged.  
“没有亚当，什么都不会发生。”律子耸了耸肩。

"I see. I shall leave, then." Rei said before turning around and heading to the exit. "Shinji and Asuka need help, I will go help them."  
"我明白了。那我就告辞了。" 丽说完，转身向出口走去。"真嗣和明日香需要帮助，我去帮他们。"

With that, the young Rei Ayanami promptly left the chamber in delicate footsteps. The head scientist of NERV smiled sadly, pulling out a remote controller from her lab coat pocket.  
话音刚落，年轻的绫波丽便轻盈地离开了房间。NERV 的首席科学家苦笑着从白大褂口袋里掏出一个遥控器。

She had long accepted her own doom, though she had to make NERV, or at least the Commander would go down along with her. She was tired of being used as a tool. Knowing the scenario would never work without Lilith, this would be the perfect way to put an end to all.  
她早已接受了自己的命运，尽管她要让 NERV，至少是司令，与她一同坠入深渊。她厌倦了被当作工具。明知没有莉莉丝，计划永远不会成功，这将是终结一切的完美方式。

However, now that Gendo was no more, was her actions necessary anymore? The only person she hated was Gendo.  
然而，如今碇源堂已不复存在，她的行动还有必要吗？她唯一憎恨的人就是碇源堂。

Still, she had already come so far down the road. Even if she didn't destroy Lilith, there would be no place for her to stay in the world anymore, anyway.  
尽管如此，她已经走到了这一步。即使她不摧毁莉莉丝，这个世界也再无她的容身之地了。

Ritsuko made a sad smile as she thought about the pilots. They took all of Gendo's care and attention from her, but was it really their fault? They were only children, tools for them to achieve Godhood.  
律子苦笑着思考着那些驾驶员。他们夺走了碇源堂所有的关心和注意，但这真的是他们的错吗？他们只是孩子，是他们实现神性的工具。

Just like herself. 就像她自己一样。

Was it empathy that she felt?  
她感受到的是共情吗？

"I'm such a fool..." The blonde doctor knelt on the ground and cried.  
“我真是个傻瓜……”金发女医生跪在地上，泪流满面。

She didn't notice how long it had been until she had stopped crying, but when she did the silhouette of Rei Ayanami was long gone by then.  
她并未察觉自己哭了多久，直到停止哭泣时，才发现绫波零的身影早已消失无踪。

Dr. Akagi finally made her decision and pressed the red button on the center of the screen, anticipating an eruption of flames to overtake her in death's sweet embrace.  
赤木律子博士终于下定决心，按下了屏幕中央的红色按钮，期待着烈焰爆发，将自己吞噬在死亡的甜蜜怀抱中。

"Mother…" "母亲…"

Shinji took a deep breath inside the LCL around him, gripping the controls tightly as he focused. He had thought turning against his father in the last moment would be an easy task to do, at least emotionally, though he had never thought it would bring such a mood turmoil to him.  
真嗣在周围的 LCL 中深吸了一口气，紧紧抓住操纵杆集中精神。他原以为在最后一刻反抗父亲在情感上会相对容易，尽管他从未想过这会给他带来如此剧烈的情绪波动。

Suddenly the whole EVA cage shook violently, glasses breaking into pieces. "What's going on?!" He shouted into the microphone.  
突然间，整个 EVA 笼子剧烈摇晃，玻璃碎裂成片。"发生什么事了？！"他对着麦克风大喊。

"There's an explosion in Central Dogma!" Maya's voice echoed in his cockpit. "We've set the absorbers to maximum! It should withstand the physical impact!"  
"中央 dogma 发生了爆炸！" 真嗣的驾驶舱内回荡着绫波的声音。"我们已经将吸收器调至最大！应该能承受住物理冲击！"

Shinji's eyes went wide. Did Dr. Akagi successfully destroy Lilith? He took a look at Adam in his hand before shaking his head. "Activate Unit 01!"  
真嗣的眼睛瞪大了。赤木博士成功摧毁了莉莉丝吗？他看了一眼手中的亚当，然后摇了摇头。"启动 01 号机！"

"…Establishing A-10 connections…"  
"…建立 A-10 连接…"

He shook his head again, clearing his mind a little. Asuka was still fighting alone on the surface, and she needed his help as soon as possible. From the PA system, he could hear her maniac battle cries mixed with pained yelps, making him increasingly anxious for each passing moment.  
他再次摇了摇头，稍微清空了思绪。明日香仍在地面上孤军奋战，她急需他的援助。从扩音系统中，他听到她狂热的战斗呼喊混杂着痛苦的叫声，每一刻都让他愈发焦虑。

"Ibuki-san? Why I'm still not activating?" Shinji opened his eyes with a confused expression. The entry plug still felt cold and dark.  
“伊吹小姐？为什么我还未启动？” 真嗣睁开眼睛，脸上带着困惑的表情。插入栓依旧感觉冰冷而黑暗。

"You aren't even passing the absolute borderline…the EVA won't activate!"  
“你甚至没有越过绝对界限……EVA 无法启动！”

Shinji felt a chill ran down his spine. "How? How possible?!" He exclaimed. "Make it move! Now!"  
真嗣感到一股寒意沿着脊背直窜而下。“怎么可能？怎么可能？！”他惊呼道，“让它动起来！现在！”

"I can't!" Maya's panicked voice came through the speakers, hitting him like a meteor.  
“我做不到！”摩耶惊慌失措的声音通过扬声器传来，如同流星般击中了他。

A dawning horror washed over Shinji's face as realization struck him. When he was absorbed by Unit 01, his mother saw everything. She knew what he had planned – to prevent the Third Impact from happening, which was contrasting her ultimate goal.  
当意识到这一点时，真嗣的脸上浮现出一种逐渐升起的恐惧。当他被初号机吸收时，他的母亲看到了一切。她知道他的计划——阻止第三次冲击的发生，这与她的最终目标截然相反。

Then why would she help him?  
那她为什么要帮他呢？

"No no no no…" Shinji muttered. "No! Mother, you can't do this! Move! Please move!" He thrashed the controls violently, punching the buttons in a random manner.  
"不不不不……" 真嗣喃喃自语。"不！妈妈，你不能这么做！动啊！求你动一下！" 他猛烈地操纵着控制器，胡乱地敲打着按钮。

EVA Unit 01 continued to remain in dead silence.  
EVA 初号机依旧保持着死寂。

"You sick bastards!" Asuka shrieked, willing Unit 02 to dodge another potentially lethal attack from the joint-attack by two MP EVAs. "I'm getting really sick and tired of this shit!" Putting all of its power forth, Unit 02 shoved both EVAs back, forcing them to stumble and give her some breathing room.  
"你们这些变态！" 明日香尖叫着，操控零二号机躲避来自两台 MP EVA 联合攻击的又一次致命打击。"我真是受够了这种烂事！" 零二号机全力出击，将两台 EVA 推开，迫使它们踉跄后退，为自己争取了一些喘息的空间。

"Asuka!" Maya's voice filled the entry plug. "You've only got one minute left!"  
"明日香！" 真希波的声音在插入栓内响起。"你只剩下最后一分钟了！"

"I know that already!" She hissed, looking up at the counter as the timer reached closer and closer to zero by the second. Before she could take much time to assess how much time she had left, the third and fourth MP EVAs bum-rushed her whilst swinging their great blades.  
"我早就知道了！" 她低声咆哮，抬头看着计时器一秒秒逼近零。还没等她仔细评估剩余时间，第三和第四台 MP EVA 便猛冲过来，挥舞着巨大的刀刃。

Now that she was facing multiple MP EVAs at the same time, Asuka started to realize why she had been gaining the upper hand till now. Before, the MP EVAs would always attack in line, making it rather easy for her to deal with.  
现在她同时面对多台 MP EVA，明日香开始意识到为何自己至今一直占据上风。之前，MP EVA 总是排成一线攻击，让她处理起来相当轻松。

Therefore, when the eight remaining MP EVAs lunged at her almost simultaneously from different directions, Asuka soon found herself lose track of what to do.  
因此，当剩下的八台 MP EVA 几乎同时从不同方向扑向她时，明日香很快发现自己不知所措。

It wasn't going to stop her, though. The MP EVAs' movements were abnormally slow, as if operating under insufficient power. With a copy of the Lance at hand, Asuka leaped into the air, aiming the spear at the most intact EVA and threw with all of her might.  
但这并不能阻止她。MP EVA 的动作异常缓慢，仿佛电力不足。明日香手持复制的长枪，一跃而起，瞄准最完好的 EVA，全力投掷出去。

The Lance clone shattered its core like bullet piercing glass, the EVA fell down to the ground in an eyeblink. "Ha! Take that! Only four to-Ahh!" Driven to distraction, Asuka let out a yelp as another MP EVA successfully landed a swing of its blade at Unit 02's back, leaving a mild cut on it.  
蓝斯复制体如同子弹穿透玻璃般粉碎了核心，EVA 随即眨眼间坠落地面。“哈！尝尝这个！只剩四个了——啊！”分心的明日香惊叫一声，另一台 MP EVA 成功挥刀击中了 02 机的背部，留下一道轻微的划痕。

Just as she turned around and wanted to see which one of those bastards dared to sneak stack her, Asuka was welcomed with the sight of seven MP EVAs lunging at her at high speeds. Acting on reflex, she tried to control her EVA to jump away from the spot.  
正当她转身想要看看是哪个混蛋胆敢偷袭她时，明日香迎面撞上了七台高速扑来的 MP EVA。出于本能，她试图操控自己的 EVA 跳离原地。

Though nothing happened. 然而，什么也没发生。

Unit 02 fell limp as the timer ticked to zero.  
02 号机随着计时器归零而瘫软下来。

"NO!" Asuka barked, pushing and pulling the controls of her EVA. But it won't move, not without power anymore.  
“不！”明日香咆哮着，推拉她的 EVA 控制器。但它动不了，没有电力就无法行动。

Even though she couldn't see what was going on outside, from the sudden jarring acceleration, she knew her EVA was being thrown around, most likely by the remaining active MP EVAs. Somehow even without power, she could still feel what her EVA felt; she yelped in pain as one of the remaining MP EVAs cut off one arm of Unit 02 with its blade.  
尽管她看不见外面的情况，但从突然的剧烈加速中，她知道自己的 EVA 正在被抛来抛去，很可能是被剩余的活动 MP EVA 所为。不知为何，即使没有电力，她仍能感受到 EVA 的感受；当一台剩余的 MP EVA 用刀切断 02 号机的一只手臂时，她痛得叫出声来。

"Urgh…AHH!" With a vicious kick to the side, EVA Unit 08 sent the crimson Unit into the air. Unit 02 crashed on a nearby hill, smoke started to rise from underneath.  
“呃啊…啊！”随着对侧面的一记猛踢，EVA 八号机将红色机体踢向空中。二号机坠落在附近的山丘上，烟雾开始从下方升起。

No matter how hard it was for her to admit, she didn't stand a chance against them alone.  
无论她多么不愿承认，独自一人面对他们，她毫无胜算。

She needed Shinji. 她需要真嗣。

Or did she? 还是她没有？

"I'll show you!" If the seventeenth Angel could control an EVA without power, she could as well.  
"我会证明给你看！" 既然第十七使徒能在无电源的情况下操控 EVA，她也能做到。

With a determined expression, Asuka took off her eyepatch.  
带着坚定的表情，明日香摘下了眼罩。

"AHHH!" The moment the Anti-L material came off, Asuka felt an alien sensation surge through her entire body. The agony was excruciating; she arched her back, screaming as the Seal Pillar came out of her left eye, glowing as the Angel quickly took over.  
"啊——！" 当反 L 物质被移除的那一刻，明日香感到一种异样的感觉涌遍全身。剧痛难以忍受；她弓起背，尖叫着，封印柱从她的左眼中脱离，随着使徒迅速接管，光芒闪烁。

"What the hell is she doing?!" Misato exclaimed, her voice horrified.  
"她到底在干什么？！" 美里惊呼，声音中充满了恐惧。

"We've detected new patten blue on the battlefield! Inside Unit 02!" Aobo reported.  
"战场检测到新的蓝色模式！在二号机内部！" 青叶报告道。

"She's using herself as the power source…" Maya's impression, as timid as she usually was, didn't look any better. "The S2 engine… she's using the S2 engine inside her!"  
"她把自己当作电源了……" 玛雅的印象，一如既往地胆怯，看起来并不乐观。"S2 机关……她正在使用她体内的 S2 机关！"

"Urghhh…" Hyperventilating, Asuka clenched her fists tightly, the rubbery material of her plugsuit creaking as she did. Feeling infinite power course through her, Asuka was positively surprised that she was still conscious.  
"呃啊……" 阿斯卡喘着粗气，紧紧握拳，紧身战斗服的橡胶材质在她动作时发出吱吱声。感受到无穷的力量涌入体内，阿斯卡惊喜地发现自己仍然清醒。

"Unit 02 reactivated!" "二号机重新启动！"

Everything around her turned back to life. Asuka smiled a weak smile as she saw the main panel of her EVA.  
她周围的一切恢复了生机。明日香看到她的 EVA 主面板时，露出了一个虚弱的微笑。

"It's really good for you to show up right now, wondergirl!" Asuka exclaimed as she shoved away another one of the MP EVAs and stabbed the blade into its core.  
“你来得真是时候，奇迹女孩！”明日香喊道，她推开另一台量产 EVA，将刀刃刺入其核心。

"I shall help my friends," Rei replied calmly, blocking the attack from the MP EVA and forcing it away from her. As much as she wanted to help to fight, Unit 00 wasn't exactly built for combat. For the remaining eight MP EVAs, they split the work by half for each person to reach maximum efficiency.  
“我必须帮助我的朋友们，”绫波平静地回应，挡下了量产 EVA 的攻击并将其逼退。尽管她渴望参与战斗，但零号机并非专为战斗设计。剩下的八台量产 EVA，她们两人各分担一半，以达到最高效率。

Still, Rei's contribution to the battle was indispensable - she was able to demolish one of the four MP EVAs, and made sure it wouldn't regenerate by shattering its core.  
尽管如此，绫波在战斗中的贡献不可或缺——她成功摧毁了四台量产 EVA 中的一台，并通过粉碎其核心确保它无法再生。

"Die!" Asuka shrieked as she claimed another kill.  
“去死吧！”明日香尖叫着，又夺走了一个生命。

Shinji still hadn't shown up yet. There was still a part of her, that refused to believe Shinji would leave her for the next innocent Asuka, that he would go out and help her, but as time passed, the hope was slowly being crushed into dust.  
真嗣仍然没有出现。她心中仍有一部分不愿相信真嗣会为了下一个无辜的明日香而离开她，会去帮助她，但随着时间的流逝，这份希望正慢慢被碾成尘埃。

"Go to hell!" With a distorted scream, Asuka sliced another MP EVA Unit into halves along with its core.  
“下地狱去吧！”明日香扭曲着尖叫，将另一台 MP EVA 单位连同其核心一起劈成两半。

"Mother, please." “妈妈，求你了。”

He didn't know how long he had been staying inside the completely dark and cold entry plug of EVA Unit 01 trying to activate the mech. Nothing really happened, except for the constant battle cries from the blood-boiling redhead that echoed through the EVA cages. Even though Shinji knew he had to put all of his attention into activating the EVA, but he found himself unable to ignore Asuka's cries, pained or excited.  
他不知道自己在 EVA 初号机的完全黑暗且冰冷的插入栓里待了多久，试图启动这台机甲。除了从热血沸腾的红发少女那里不断传来的战斗呼喊声在 EVA 笼中回荡外，什么也没发生。尽管真嗣知道他必须全神贯注地激活 EVA，但他发现自己无法忽视明日香的呼喊，无论是痛苦的，还是兴奋的。

"Please, wake up." “求求你，醒过来。”

Maya had told him that nothing was wrong on their side; or rather, they had no idea of how to fix it. Shinji knew what was wrong, though. His mother must've seen everything during the period when he was trapped inside Unit 01's core. She wouldn't let him ruin her plan for humanity's future just for some girl, would she?  
玛雅曾告诉他，他们那边一切正常；或者更确切地说，他们不知道如何解决这个问题。但真嗣知道问题所在。他的母亲一定在他被困在初号机核心期间看到了一切。她不会为了一个女孩就让他破坏她为人类未来制定的计划，对吧？

"Mother, why do you have to be like this?!" Shinji shouted, banging his fist on the controls. "Why wouldn't you just let me help her!"  
“妈妈，你为什么要这样？！”真嗣喊道，拳头重重地敲在控制台上。“为什么不让我帮她！”

The entry plug continued to remain cold and silent despite Shinji's almost desperate calls. "Why, mother?!" He screamed. "Is this what you really want?! Talk to me, I'm your son!"  
尽管真嗣近乎绝望地呼唤，插入栓依旧保持着冰冷和沉默。“为什么，妈妈？！”他尖叫道。“这就是你真正想要的吗？！跟我说话，我是你的儿子！”

This time, though, suddenly Shinji felt a familiar, yet subtly unfamiliar sensation surging through his body as his vision was blurred by a kaleidoscope of colors before Yui Ikari's unmistakable silhouette emerged from the endless space. "Shinji…" The said boy saw her and heard her voice, but he didn't feel relieved. He knew that voice all too well.  
"然而这一次，突然间，一种熟悉却又微妙地陌生的感觉在真嗣体内涌动，他的视野被万花筒般的色彩模糊，随后从无尽的空间中浮现出碇唯那不容错认的轮廓。“真嗣……”少年看见了她，听到了她的声音，却并未感到宽慰。他太熟悉这个声音了。”

"Mother…" Shinji replied, mentally preparing himself for the imminent storm. Whatever it takes, he would do it for Asuka.  
"“妈妈……”真嗣回应道，在心中为即将到来的风暴做好准备。无论付出什么代价，他都会为了明日香去做。”

He didn't know exactly what to say to move her mother's mind, though. He had rarely gotten this far – during most of his previous cycles, they would fail against the MP EVAs, or his father successfully initiated Third Impact of his own. Not to mention his mother had always wanted the Human Instrumentality Project to happen as well, so that she could leave evidence that humanity existed.  
"他并不确切知道该如何说服母亲改变心意。他很少能走到这一步——在之前的循环中，他们大多会败给量产型 EVA，或是他的父亲成功引发了第三次冲击。更不用说，他的母亲一直也希望人类补完计划能够实现，以便留下人类存在的证据。”

"Shinji…who are you?" "真嗣…你是谁？"

Shinji blinked. "I am Shinji Ikari, the Third Child and the pilot of Unit 01," his voice turned confused as he spoke. "And…your son, mother."  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“我是碇真嗣，第三适格者，也是 01 机体的驾驶员，”他开口时声音变得困惑。“而且…是你的儿子，妈妈。”

"My Shinji…" Yui stared at the boy with an incredulous expression. "You are not the Shinji I remember. The moment you stepped into the EVA I sensed there was something wrong with you. I thought it was just it's been so long…" She seemed to take a deep breath before she continued. "Who…are you?"  
"我的真嗣…" 唯难以置信地盯着男孩。“你不是我记忆中的真嗣。你一进入 EVA，我就感觉到你有些不对劲。我以为只是时间太久了…”她似乎深吸了一口气，然后继续说道。“你…到底是谁？”

Shinji chuckled, ignoring the inappropriacy of such behavior under a grim situation like this. "You must've seen it…what I've been through. What _you_ put me through, made me turn into who I am right now."  
真嗣轻声笑了出来，尽管在这种严峻的情况下，这样的行为显得不合时宜。“你一定看到了……我所经历的一切。你让我经历的那些，让我变成了现在的我。”

Yui frowned, unable to understand anything. Even though she had got glimpses of Shinji's past memories, to which some of them were quite disturbing and, not to mention, concerning herself, she never knew the logic behind it. "But that wasn't my intent-"  
唯皱起眉头，完全无法理解。尽管她曾瞥见过真嗣过去的记忆，其中一些相当令人不安，更不用说还牵扯到她自己，但她从未明白其中的逻辑。“但那并非我的本意——”

"Mother," Shinji cut her off in a firm voice. Asuka was still fighting outside, which wasn't making this any easier for him. "The Human Instrumentality Project isn't what you think it will be…" His eyes turned sad. "Look at me…do you have any idea of what I was thrown into? Is this what you expect to happen?"  
“母亲，”真嗣坚定地打断了她。明日香还在外面战斗，这让他更加难以承受。“人类补完计划并不是你所想象的那样……”他的眼神变得悲伤。“看看我……你知道我被卷入了什么吗？这就是你所期望发生的吗？”

Yui's eyelids fell, unable to counter with anything.  
优的眼睛闭上了，无法反驳任何话。

"Future for humanity…" Shinji let out a short laugh. "Now I remembered, what you said on the day of the activation test of Unit 01. I can tell you now, mother, that humanity will only have its own future without Human Instrumentality Project."  
"人类的未来…" 真嗣发出了一声短促的笑声。"现在我想起来了，你在零号机启动测试那天说的话。我现在可以告诉你，妈妈，人类只会拥有自己的未来，不需要人类补完计划。"

"Is it all because of Kyoko's daughter?" Yui suddenly spoke up, eliciting a raised eyebrow from Shinji, who chuckled at that question.  
"这一切都是因为绫波的女儿吗？" 优突然开口，让真嗣挑了挑眉，对这个问题的反应是轻笑。

"Does it matter? My future should be in my own hands. I don't need you, mother, to plan anything for me." He replied.  
"这有什么关系？我的未来应该掌握在自己手中。我不需要你，妈妈，为我计划任何事情。" 他回答道。

"You're delusional, Shinji," Yui replied with an uncharacteristically cold face. "The moment the Second Impact happens, the future for humanity is set in stone. EVAs are a must, or we'll be eliminated by the Angels. But if we don't start the Instrumentality Project after the last Angel is defeated, what do you think the humans will do with Lilith and Adam?"  
"你真是妄想，真嗣，" 绫波零以一种异常冷漠的表情回答，"第二次冲击发生的那一刻，人类的未来就已经注定。EVA 是必须的，否则我们会被使徒消灭。但如果我们在击败最后一个使徒后不启动人类补完计划，你认为人类会如何对待莉莉丝和亚当？"

"Enlighten me," Shinji shrugged.  
"请赐教，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"War." Yui spit. "They could build as many EVAs as they want with Lilith and Adam. And what do you think will happen to Asuka, who's an EVA pilot, if a war breaks out? If you really love her so much, you should know that the Human Instrumentality Project is the best result she can ever get."  
“战争。”唯啐道，“他们可以用莉莉丝和亚当造出他们想要的任何 EVA。而你想想，一旦战争爆发，身为 EVA 驾驶员的明日香会怎样？如果你真的那么爱她，你就该明白，人类补完计划是她能得到的最好结局。”

This time though, Shinji did fall silent. He had never really given a serious thought about the future after the Angel Wars since it had always seemed rather far away from him. Now that his mother mentioned it, he suddenly found the question hard to answer.  
然而这一次，真嗣确实陷入了沉默。他从未真正认真思考过天使战争之后的未来，因为那似乎总是离他很遥远。如今母亲提及此事，他突然发现这个问题难以回答。

Maybe his mother was right? That because the Second Impact can't be reversed, the best outcome for humanity was to all turn into a primordial soup?  
或许他母亲是对的？因为第二次冲击无法逆转，人类最好的结局就是全部化为原始汤？

On second thought, Lilith was likely already destroyed by Ritsuko. He had Adam at hand, he had to think of a way to destroy it as well, then it would be all good, right?  
再一想，莉莉丝很可能已经被律子摧毁了。他手中有亚当，他必须想办法也摧毁它，这样一切就都好了，对吧？

Perhaps his mother heard his thoughts, perhaps not. "I never thought you could escape from the dream I created for you. You could've lived in there forever and be together with her. It was really, really the world you deserved. Why did you wake up?"  
也许他母亲听到了他的想法，也许没有。“我从没想过你能逃出我为你编织的梦境。你本可以在那里永远生活，与她在一起。那真的是，真的是你应得的世界。你为何要醒来？”

"Because Asuka would've been left alone." Shinji's response came out instantly despite his musing about the future. "I made her a promise. And I'll keep it forever."  
"因为明日香会孤单一人。" 尽管沉思着未来，真嗣的回答立刻脱口而出。"我向她许下了承诺。我会永远遵守它。"

"Stubborn, just like your father…" Yui chuckled. "What is it that you really want from this, Shinji?"  
"固执，和你父亲一模一样……" 绫波笑了笑。"你真正想要的是什么，真嗣？"

"I…I just…" Shinji almost sobbed. Her mother's insight about the future really struck him hard. Was he-no, was Asuka doomed to never live a normal and happy life? Then what good he was? "I just want her to be happy. I want her not to pilot the EVA ever again, even if at the cost of…" Shinji pondered for a moment, his eyes turned sad before he continued. "Even if, without the EVA, she'll never know me."  
"我……我只是……" 真嗣几乎哽咽。母亲对未来的洞察真的击中了他。难道他——不，是明日香注定无法过上正常而幸福的生活吗？那么他还有什么用呢？"我只是希望她能幸福。我希望她再也不要驾驶 EVA，即使这意味着……" 真嗣沉思片刻，眼神变得悲伤，然后继续说道。"即使没有 EVA，她永远不会认识我。"

"I don't care whether we get together or not. I'm really, really getting tired of all this, of seeing her get hurt, seeing her die and unable to do anything…just to repeat the process again."  
"我不在乎我们是否能在一起。我真的，真的厌倦了这一切，看着她受伤，看着她死去却无能为力……只是又一次重复这个过程。"

"I just want her to live her own happy life, even if it's a life without me."  
"我只希望她能过上她自己的幸福生活，即使那是一个没有我的生活。"

"Mother…will you help me?"  
"母亲…你能帮我吗？"

"Die!" Asuka shrieked as she tackled one of the four remaining MP EVAs down to the ground and began a vicious slaughter. "Rei, help me fend them off!"  
“去死吧！”明日香尖叫着扑倒了一台剩余的四台 MP EVA 之一，开始了一场残忍的屠杀。“丽，帮我挡住它们！”

"Roger," Rei's reply came out quick and clean. The blue Unit 00 faced the three MP EVAs on her own without so much as a usable weapon. Rei soon found herself surrounded by the white monsters, unable to move as her EVA was tackled to the ground face-down.  
“收到，”丽的回应迅速而干脆。蓝色零号机独自面对着三台 MP EVA，没有任何可用武器。丽很快发现自己被白色的怪物包围，无法动弹，她的 EVA 被扑倒在地，面朝下。

There was still one thing she could do, though.  
不过，她还有一件事可以做。

"This is my last assistance, Pilot Soryu," Rei spoke into the microphones before punching the plug ejection button and turning the self-destruct handle.  
“这是我的最后一次援助，飞行员碇ソリュ，” 绫波对着麦克风说道，随即按下插入栓弹射按钮并转动自毁手柄。

Before Asuka could realize what was going on, flames and smoke shot out from the back of Unit 00 as the entry plug shot into the air above the hole on the Geofront top and flew across the sky atop the entire city wreckage of Tokyo-3.  
在明日香意识到发生了什么之前，火焰和浓烟从零号机的背部喷涌而出，插入栓冲天而起，穿过地底都市顶部的洞口，飞越整个被毁的第三新东京市上空。

Then, like a supernova explosion, a massive fireball engulfed the three MP EVAs that once had Unit 00 encircled and damaged.  
紧接着，如同超新星爆发一般，一个巨大的火球吞噬了曾经包围并损伤零号机的三台 MP EVA。

"Thank you, Rei," Asuka whispered to herself, dealing the final killer blow to the MP EVA on the ground in front of her with the gigantic blade. With a vicious stab, the blade cut through the MP EVA's substandard S2 engine along with the dummy plug system behind it like a knife cutting through cheese.  
"谢谢你，丽，" 明日香自言自语道，用那巨大的刀刃对准地上的量产型 EVA 发出了致命一击。猛力一刺，刀刃如同切开奶酪般贯穿了量产型 EVA 劣质的 S2 引擎及其背后的模拟插入栓系统。

"I did it." At first, it was only a mumble to herself. "I did it!" Now it was an excited cry. Had she actually done it, defeating the invasion forces and the MP EVAs and saving the world by herself? Well, she had some help from Rei, sure, but she was undoubtedly the major contributing factor.  
"我做到了。" 起初，这只是她对自己低声的呢喃。"我做到了！" 现在，这变成了兴奋的呼喊。难道她真的做到了吗？独自击败了入侵部队和量产型 EVA，拯救了世界？当然，她确实得到了丽的帮助，但她无疑是主要的贡献者。

On top of that, she didn't need Shinji's help throughout all this.  
更重要的是，她在这整个过程中完全不需要真嗣的帮助。

"Screw you, Ikari!" She shouted at nothing in particular. After all, she had proved that even without Shinji, she could still stop the world from ending. Shinji was still nowhere to be seen, though. However, Asuka didn't really care about it right now. If anything, a new dark idea started to form in her mind.  
"去你的，碇！" 她对着空无一物的地方大喊。毕竟，她已经证明即使没有真嗣，她也能阻止世界末日。然而，真嗣依然不见踪影。不过，明日香现在并不太在意这件事。相反，一个新的黑暗念头开始在她脑海中形成。

If she could defeat the MP EVAs all by herself in this cycle, she believed the Asukas in other cycles could do it as well. She gritted her teeth as a disgusting realization dawned on her. What if Shinji's just using her for pleasure, and left her as soon as she found out the truth, in his other cycles as well?  
如果她能在这个循环中独自击败所有 MP EVA，她相信其他循环中的明日香也能做到。她咬紧牙关，一种令人作呕的领悟涌上心头。如果真嗣只是利用她来满足欲望，一旦她发现真相就立刻离开她，在其他循环中也是如此呢？

Even though some of his actions didn't sit well with the concept at all, the small rational voices were flooded by the tsunami of anger.  
尽管他的一些行为完全不符合这个概念，但那些微弱的理性声音被愤怒的海啸淹没了。

She had to hold back another surge of tears and eagerness to cry out loud as she recalled the happy moments she had spent with Shinji. She had been alone for most of her life after her mother's death, and during the periods of time after she met Shinji, Asuka truly felt happy and homely.  
当她回想起与真嗣共度的快乐时光时，她不得不再次抑制住涌上心头的泪水和放声大哭的冲动。母亲去世后，她大部分时间都是孤独一人，而在遇见真嗣后的那些日子里，明日香真正感受到了幸福和家的温暖。

Did those promises mean nothing?  
那些承诺难道就毫无意义吗？

Of course not. In fact, they meant everything to her. However, the promises were made under the prerequisite that Shinji would keep his promises as well, and they were to be totally honest with each other. If Shinji had already left her for the next Asuka, and he broke the trust by deceiving her for such a long time, she felt she didn't need to put up with him anymore.  
当然不是。事实上，那些承诺对她来说意味着一切。然而，这些承诺的前提是真嗣也会遵守他的承诺，并且他们要完全坦诚相待。如果真嗣已经为了下一个明日香而离开她，并且长时间欺骗她，破坏了信任，她觉得她没有必要再忍受他了。

Even though Asuka tried to convince herself that she should think like this, her heart couldn't comply.  
尽管明日香试图说服自己应该这样想，但她的心却无法顺从。

It simply hurt too much.  
只是痛得太厉害了。

"I hate you." She hissed. It wasn't really a hatred directed toward Shinji as a person – it was more to herself, that she wasn't able to sort out the emotions and perhaps just simply let go. She hated feeling weak.  
“我恨你。”她低声怒道。这并非真的针对真嗣这个人——更多的是恨自己，恨自己无法理清这些情感，也许只是简单地放手。她痛恨自己的软弱。

"Unit 02, heading back to the Headquarters," Asuka said after taking several deep breaths. She didn't get any reply, though. Maybe the building was damaged too heavily by the self-destruct of Central Dogma.  
“二号机，正在返回总部。”明日香深呼吸几次后说道。然而，她并未得到任何回应。或许中央教条的自毁已经对建筑造成了过重的损害。

Shaking her head, Asuka turned away from the battlefield and began willing her EVA back to one of the retrieval points, not really caring about its operational status at this point.  
明日香摇了摇头，转身离开战场，开始用意念引导她的 EVA 返回其中一个回收点，此刻她并不太在意其运行状态。

"…suka! Wat…out!" “…讨厌！什…出去！”

Suddenly a muffled voice came out of the speakers, which Asuka immediately recognized as Misato's. However, the meaning of the phrases went over her head since she was still being overwhelmed by the emotions.  
突然，扬声器中传来一个沉闷的声音，明日香立刻辨认出那是美里。然而，由于她仍被情绪所淹没，那些话语的含义并未传入她的脑海。

It wasn't until the radar on her screen blared, indicating fast projectiles incoming, that finally caught her attention. Asuka snapped around, just to see three copies of the Lance of Longinus flew toward her at supersonic speeds.  
直到屏幕上的雷达发出警报，提示有高速弹丸来袭，这才终于引起了她的注意。明日香猛地转身，只见三支朗基努斯之枪的复制品正以超音速向她飞来。

She didn't even have time to think, not about the reasons why weren't the MP EVAs killed by the self-destruct of Unit 00, nor about what she was supposed to do, how to dodge the deadly attack. Asuka simply stood there as she watched the Lances coming in close at her and waited for the inevitable.  
她甚至来不及思考，无论是为何零号机的自爆没有摧毁 MP 初号机，还是她应该如何应对，如何闪避这致命一击。明日香只是站在那里，眼看着长枪逼近，等待着不可避免的命运。

However, before the Lances could even reach her, a purple figure flashed in front of her, blocking the sight.  
然而，在兰斯家族的人还未触及她之前，一道紫色身影已闪现至她面前，挡住了视线。

_CLANK CLANK CLANK 叮叮叮_

Asuka could hear a bone-chilling scream that sent Goosebumps down her arms in a familiar voice.  
明日香能听到一个熟悉的声音发出令人毛骨悚然的尖叫，让她手臂上起了一层鸡皮疙瘩。

"This isn't how everything is supposed to go!" For the first time in a long while, Keel's voice actually sounded genuinely panicked. He had seen most of the things in life that could be labeled as 'disturbing', though what was happening right now still terrified him. "This is our life's work!"  
“事情不应该是这样的！” 久违地，基尔的声音听起来真的慌了。他一生中见过大多数可以被称为‘令人不安’的事物，但眼下发生的事情仍然让他感到恐惧。“这是我们毕生的心血！”

"The condition of Lilith and Adam is unknown. The MP EVAs are all destroyed." SEELE 03 followed, listing out every fact that indicated their complete failure. "There's no turning back from now."  
“莉莉丝和亚当的状况不明。所有量产 EVA 都被摧毁了。” SEELE 03 接着列出了每一个表明他们彻底失败的事实。“现在已经没有回头路了。”

"It seems like we have failed." SEELE 06 stated, his voice oddly calm despite the gravity of the situation.  
"看来我们失败了。" SEELE 06 说道，尽管情况严重，他的声音却异常平静。

"No matter," SEELE 01 finally showed the first sign of calming down. "We still have the resources. We still have the chance. Five years, ten years, even decades. The MP EVAs can be reconstructed. We can start a war fought by Evangelions if we need. As long as-" Suddenly, his voice trailed off, leaving the remaining eleven members of SEELE Committee slightly confused.  
"没关系，" SEELE 01 终于显露出平静下来的第一个迹象。"我们仍有资源。我们仍有希望。五年，十年，甚至几十年。MP 使徒可以重建。如果需要，我们可以发动一场由福音战士进行的战争。只要——" 突然，他的声音渐渐消失，让 SEELE 委员会剩下的十一名成员略感困惑。

"Lorenz?" SEELE 07's quizzical voice echoed in the darkened meeting room.  
"洛伦兹？" SEELE 07 疑惑的声音在昏暗的会议室中回响。

"What a surprise to meet you here, Mr. Kaji." Keel's voice came out again, hitting every other SEELE member like a truck.  
"在这里遇见你真是意外，加持先生。" 基尔的声音再次响起，像一辆卡车一样撞击着每一位 SEELE 成员。

"Kaji? How is he still alive?!"  
"加持？他怎么还活着？！"

"There's no way!" "这不可能！"

"What is he doing here? How did he find out where Keel hides at?"  
"他在这里做什么？他是怎么找到基尔藏身之处的？"

"It really took me some effort to track you down." Kaji's smug, yet carrying a dangerously low tone voice floated from the speakers, with an instinctive sound of unlocking gun safety. "And now… it's your time to pay for it. Go to hell and greet the death himself, you devil."  
"我可是费了不少劲才找到你的。" 卡吉那自满却又带着危险低沉的嗓音从扬声器中飘出，伴随着本能的枪械保险解锁声。"而现在……是时候让你为此付出代价了。下地狱去迎接死神吧，你这恶魔。"

_BANG_

The loud sound of cartridge explosion echoed in the room several times before it finally subsided. A wave of panicked chattering rippled through the room, just to be cut off by a dry cough. "Well, I wonder what are these switches for?"  
子弹爆炸的巨响在房间里回荡了几次，最终才渐渐平息。一阵恐慌的窃窃私语在房间里蔓延开来，却被一声干咳打断。"那么，这些开关是用来做什么的呢？"

"Wait, you can't-" Before SEELE 02 could get his sentence fully delivered, the monolith representing his existence went out after a clear sound of pulling the switch.  
“等等，你不能——”SEELE 02 的话还未说完，代表他存在的石碑便随着一声清晰的开关声熄灭了。

"How convenient," Kaji let out a short laugh and pulled another switch.  
"真是方便啊，" 加持轻笑一声，又拉下另一个开关。

SEELE 03's light went out as well.  
SEELE 03 的灯光也随之熄灭。

"This one...is for Asuka."  
"这个...是给明日香的。"

Pull.

SEELE 04's monolith hologram shut off along with the life-supporting devices.  
SEELE 04 的全息影像与生命维持装置一同关闭。

Ignoring the panicked reactions from the remaining monoliths, one by one, Kaji continued to pull the switches that held the lives of SEELE members. Even though he wasn't really a fan of acting as a serial murderer, he could swear he was thoroughly enjoying every single moment of it.  
无视其余全息影像的恐慌反应，Kaji 一个接一个地拉下控制 SEELE 成员生命的开关。尽管他并不热衷于扮演连环杀手的角色，但他敢发誓，他正充分享受着每一刻。

Cracking a twisted smile, Kaji pulled the switch that had SEELE 11 marked on it, leaving only SEELE 12's monolith hologram and SEELE 01 – the one he was using – standing in the darkened meeting room.  
Kaji 扭曲地笑了笑，拉下了标有 SEELE 11 的开关，只剩下 SEELE 12 的全息影像和他正在使用的 SEELE 01，矗立在昏暗的会议室中。

"Now, I have a few questions for you." Kaji's voice was deadly and piercing. "If your answer satisfies my curiosity…then maybe, just maybe, you'll live through this."  
“现在，我有几个问题要问你。”加持的声音冷酷而尖锐，“如果你的回答能满足我的好奇心……那么或许，只是或许，你能活着度过这一劫。”

The person behind SEELE 12, the chairman of the board of the Japan Heavy Chemical Industries, was already shaking like a leaf in the wind. He was the least politically experienced person among the twelve, and that's why he was SEELE 12 in the first place. The Committee only involved him for his practically limitless resource.  
SEELE 12 背后的那个人，日本重化学工业董事会的主席，已经在风中瑟瑟发抖。他是十二人中最缺乏政治经验的一个，这也是他成为 SEELE 12 的原因。委员会只因他几乎无限的资源而吸纳了他。

But it didn't change the fact that he was a capitalist, and Kaji knew as soon as there's benefit, he would switch sides faster than a tennis ball at Wimbledon.  
但这改变不了他是个资本家的事实，加持知道，只要有利益，他会比温布尔登的网球换边还快地改变立场。

"I will comply." SEELE 12 replied with a trembling voice.  
"我会遵从。" SEELE 12 颤抖着声音回答道。

"Good choice," Kaji spoke, pulling out a questionnaire he had developed for interrogation. The questions ranged from technical details such as how much resources were wasted for the project to how many crimes SEELE had committed against humanity.  
"明智的选择，" 加持说着，掏出一份他为审讯设计的问卷。问题涵盖了从项目浪费了多少资源到 SEELE 对人类犯下了多少罪行等技术细节。

After SEELE 12 had sent Kaji a detailed name list of the people they inserted into different countries' governments and the UN, the ponytailed man smirked. "Thank you for your cooperation. You have my regards."  
在 SEELE 12 向加持发送了一份详细的人员名单，包括他们安插在不同国家政府和联合国的人员后，这位马尾男子微微一笑。"感谢你的合作。向你致意。"

"M-my pleasure." SEELE 12 tried to force a smile. "It's not a-"  
"不-不客气。" SEELE 12 勉强挤出一个微笑。"这并不难-"

SEELE 12's monolith went out.  
SEELE 12 的石碑熄灭了。

"Oof," Kaji shook his head. "My hands aren't listening to me." Laughing, the triple-spy began making his way out of Keel's secret safe house with all the evidence he needed. Everyone on the name list deserved to be put to trial; as for those twelve…  
"哎呀，" 加持摇了摇头。"我的手不听使唤了。" 笑着，这位三重间谍带着所有需要的证据，开始离开基尔的秘密安全屋。名单上的每个人都应该接受审判；至于那十二位…

Kaji couldn't help but smile. By killing them through his own hands, he finally felt he could let go of his guilt and let his brother rest in peace.  
加治忍不住微笑。通过亲手杀死他们，他终于感到可以放下内疚，让弟弟安息。

Turning back and settling her eyes in the direction where the replica of the Lances of Longinus came from, Asuka could see three heavily damaged MP EVAs crawling on the ground with whatever was left of their bodies. Killing every single one of them was easy enough, but something else - no, _someone_ else was gripping her heart.  
转身望向朗基努斯之枪复制品的来源，明日香可以看到三台严重损坏的 MP EVA 在地上爬行，用它们残存的身体。杀死它们每一个都很容易，但有别的东西——不，是某个人——紧紧抓住了她的心。

Shinji. 真嗣。

Asuka gasped as she saw the sight before her. The replicas of the Lance of Longinus stuck inside the left eye, center of the chest, and right leg of the purple EVA Unit 01 as gushes of LCL dripped down from the gigantic wounds.  
明日香看到眼前的景象，倒吸了一口气。朗基努斯之枪的复制品插在紫色 EVA 初号机的左眼、胸口正中和右腿上，LCL 从巨大的伤口中喷涌而出。

She wanted to scold him for his 'heroic' actions, or simply being cold should be enough. He didn't come to help her earlier, why would he come now?  
她本想责备他那所谓的‘英雄’行为，或者仅仅因为他冷漠就足够了。他之前没来帮她，现在又为何会来？

"Isn't it a bit late for you to join us?" Asuka said; even though she wanted her voice to be sharp, it came out mellower than she intended it to be.  
“你现在加入是不是有点晚了？”明日香说道；尽管她想让语气尖锐些，却比她预期的要柔和。

Was it because the pained groans of Shinji were too hard for her to ignore?  
是因为真嗣痛苦的呻吟声让她难以忽视吗？

She didn't care about him anymore, did she?  
她不再关心他了，是吗？

Why was he still here in this world, but not on his way to the next one?  
为什么他还停留在这个世界，而不是走在通往下一个世界的路上？

"A-Asuka...I..." “A-明日香...我...”

Asuka said nothing as she pulled up the video feed to the inside of Unit 01's entry plug. She gasped, her right eye went wide as she saw Shinji's left eye mirror the wound on the EVA – a bloody hole was there replacing the cobalt orb.  
明日香一言不发地调出了零一号机插入栓内的视频。她倒吸一口凉气，右眼瞪得溜圆，只见真嗣的左眼映出了 EVA 上的伤口——原本湛蓝的眼球被一个血洞所取代。

She couldn't see any other wounds, though. But she bet they couldn't be easy.  
尽管她看不到其他伤口，但她敢肯定那些伤绝不会轻松。

He deserved it, didn't he?  
这是他应得的，不是吗？

"I don't need your help! Why are you here?!"  
"我不需要你的帮助！你为什么在这里？！"

"The Lance…it was going for your core," Shinji managed between pantings. "It would've killed you…which I'm not allowing to happen."  
"那长矛……它瞄准了你的核心，" 真嗣喘息着勉强说道。"它会杀了你……我绝不允许这种事发生。"

"But…why?" Asuka found herself unable to comprehend his actions. For all she knew, he would've left her and this world behind and gone on to another cycle, but instead, he stayed, and sacrificed something to save her. "Why? Why for me?" Asuka's eyelids dropped. "I broke my promise. I broke up with you. You shouldn't…"  
"但是……为什么？" 明日香发现自己无法理解他的行为。据她所知，他本可以离开她，离开这个世界，继续进入下一个循环，但他留了下来，为了救她而牺牲了某些东西。"为什么？为什么要为我这么做？" 明日香的眼睑垂下。"我违背了承诺。我和你分手了。你不应该……"

"Do you think it really matters?" Shinji let out a short laugh. "Being together with you is what I want…but it isn't everything. As long as you can live a happy life of your own, I am happy as well. It's what I promised."  
"你觉得这真的重要吗？" 真嗣发出一声短促的笑。"和你在一起是我想要的…但这不是全部。只要你能过上自己幸福的生活，我也就心满意足了。这是我承诺过的。"

Asuka soon found herself at a loss for words. Was it really his true thoughts? Or was he only saying it to manipulate her emotions? "Bullshit! You didn't make that promise to me! I'm just a replacement, a tool for your-"  
明日香很快发现自己无言以对。这真的是他的真实想法吗？还是他只是在操纵她的情绪？"胡说！你没对我做过那样的承诺！我只是个替代品，是你用来…"

"Asuka!" She was cut off by Shinji's abrupt call. "You're not anyone's replacement. You're just Asuka, and I don't see any of you differently!" Neither of them noticed that they were talking in the open channel, though. People on the wrecked command deck listened to their exchanges with confused expressions, unable to make sense of their conversation. "The person I love is Asuka, nothing more."  
"明日香！" 她被真嗣突如其来的呼唤打断了。"你不是任何人的替代品。你只是明日香，我对你的看法没有任何不同！" 他们俩都没注意到他们是在公开频道里交谈。残破指挥台上的人们听着他们的对话，脸上带着困惑的表情，无法理解他们的谈话。"我所爱的人是明日香，仅此而已。"

_He just...loves you... 他只是...爱你..._

The redhead bit down onto her lips. It was a fact that she had been denying, or instead, overwhelmed by the torrent of anger and hatred, that as long as Shinji stayed in this world, he would only love her forever and always.  
红发女孩咬紧了嘴唇。她一直否认这个事实，或者说，被愤怒和仇恨的洪流淹没，只要真嗣留在这个世界上，他就会永远只爱她一个人。

"Bullshit!" Asuka forced herself to violently shake off the thoughts, as hard as it was for her to do at this time. "If you really think like that, then where were you earlier? Why are you here only after...after..."  
“胡说八道！”明日香强迫自己猛烈地甩开这些念头，尽管在这个时候这样做对她来说非常困难。“如果你真的这么想，那你早些时候在哪里？为什么你只在...之后...才来这里？”

After she had to take off her eyepatch and became an Angel?  
在她不得不摘下眼罩并成为天使之后？

Or was it something else?  
还是说另有原因？

"I..." What was he going to say, though? How could he explain his _conversation_ with his mother in the short time the situation allowed, anyway?  
“我……” 他本想说些什么呢？无论如何，在有限的时间内，他该如何解释与母亲的那番对话呢？

"It was a problem on our side," Maya's voice suddenly cut in. "Pilot Ikari...Shinji, was in the EVA long ago. But it won't activate. He really wanted it to move, Asuka, but it wouldn't...but in the end, he did something, something I've never seen before from the readings, to get it to activate."  
"这是我们这边的问题，"真希的声音突然切入。"碇司令...真嗣，很早就进入了 EVA。但它无法启动。他真的很想让它动起来，明日香，但它就是不行...但最终，他做了些什么，从读数上看，我从未见过这样的事情，让它启动了。"

So, he didn't abandon her...  
所以，他并没有抛弃她...

It was nothing like she thought.  
这与她所想的完全不同。

But, did it really matter right now?  
但，现在这真的重要吗？

Her train of thoughts was interrupted by the sudden pain that shot through her body that originated from her left eye.  
她的思绪被突然袭来的剧痛打断，这痛楚源自她的左眼，贯穿全身。

XXXXXX

Shinji groaned as he tried to endure the excruciating pain that shot through his body. Being impaled by the fake Lance of Longinus wasn't really a strange sensation to him, though it didn't help soothe the pain by the slightest.  
真嗣呻吟着，试图忍受那穿透全身的剧痛。被假的长枪隆基努斯刺中对他来说并不陌生，但这丝毫不能减轻痛苦。

Even though he knew those wounds would leave scars – he saw them on Asuka at the red beach, he didn't really think it relevant right now.  
尽管他知道这些伤痕会留下疤痕——他在红海滩上看到了明日香身上的那些，但他此刻并不觉得这有什么相关性。

Because he could hear Asuka screaming.  
因为他能听到明日香在尖叫。

"Asuka? Asuka!" Shinji cried as he pulled up the video feed to the inside of Unit 02's entry plug. He gasped with his eyes widened as he saw what's happening to Asuka – the first thing he noticed was the lack of eyepatch, and subsequently, her glowing left eye. He felt his blood run cold as the dawning horror of realization struck him.  
"明日香？明日香！" 真嗣呼喊着，将视频信号切换到二号机的插入栓内部。他瞪大了眼睛，倒吸一口凉气，目睹了明日香的遭遇——首先映入眼帘的是她缺失的眼罩，紧接着是她闪烁着光芒的左眼。当意识到这一切的恐怖真相时，他感到血液仿佛凝固了。

Asuka was turning into an Angel.  
明日香正在变成使徒。

"No!" Shinji shouted, desperately trying to do something but couldn't come up with anything. It was a situation he had never met before. "Asuka!"  
“不！” 真嗣大喊道，拼命想要做些什么却想不出任何办法。这是他从未遇到过的情况。“明日香！”

He didn't get any replies as Asuka continued to scream in agony, arching her back as intolerable and indescribable foreign sensations shot through her fragile young body.  
他没有收到任何回应，因为明日香继续在痛苦中尖叫，她的背部弯曲，难以忍受且无法言喻的异样感觉贯穿了她脆弱的年轻身躯。

Maybe it was after an hour, or merely seconds before Asuka's screams finally faded into gasps and groans. "Sh-Shinji…" She managed between heavy breathes. "I'm…sorry…"  
或许过了一个小时，又或许只是几秒钟，明日香的尖叫声终于转为喘息和呻吟。“真-真嗣……”她喘着粗气勉强说道，“我……对不起……”

Shinji didn't know what to do, or even what to say. He kind of forgot about the possibility that Asuka could turn into an Angel at this point since she had been acting so normally for a long time.  
真嗣不知道该做什么，甚至不知道该说什么。由于明日香长时间以来一直表现得非常正常，他几乎忘记了她在此刻可能变成使徒的可能性。

"Asuka…" Even though Shinji's volume was relatively low, his heart inside was raging like the center of a hurricane. He didn't know what to do with Asuka as an Angel. Was he supposed to kill her, kill someone he loved by his own hands? He had done it before with Kaworu, though his feelings toward him, when compared to Asuka, were like comparing a grain of sand to the entire planet.  
"明日香……" 尽管真嗣的声音相对较低，但他的内心却如同飓风中心般狂暴。他不知道该如何面对作为使徒的明日香。难道他应该亲手杀死她，杀死自己所爱的人吗？他曾对渚薰这样做过，但与明日香相比，他对渚薰的感情简直如同将一粒沙子与整个星球相比较。

Slowly, Shinji took out the trigger.  
慢慢地，真嗣拿出了扳机。

Asuka could see his actions through the video feed. A sad smile crossed her face. "Shinji, you don't need-"  
明日香通过视频画面看到了他的举动。一丝哀伤的微笑掠过她的脸庞。“真嗣，你不需要——”

He threw the device against the entry plug interior with all of his might.  
他用尽全力将设备扔向插入栓内部。

The plastic remote control shattered and broke into small pieces.  
塑料遥控器碎裂成小块。

"Asuka, I'm not giving up on you."  
"明日香，我不会放弃你的。"

"You don't get it, Shinji," Asuka let out a sad chuckle, touching the DSS Choker around her neck with her hand. "I am the last Angel, this is the only way."  
"你不懂，真嗣，"" 明日香苦笑一声，用手轻触颈间的 DSS 项圈。""我是最后的使徒，这是唯一的办法。"

"No Asuka!" Shinji shouted. "We've saved you before! We can do it again!"  
"不，明日香！"" 真嗣大喊。""我们以前救过你！我们可以再做一次！"

"But…Dr. Akagi… she's there when the Central Dogma exploded…" Maya's shaky voice came to them through the speakers, putting out Shinji's last bit of hope.  
“但…赤木博士…她是在中央教条爆炸时在那里的…” 真嗣的最后一丝希望随着扬声器中传来玛雅颤抖的声音而破灭。

Asuka let out another pained yelp, taking several deep breathes before she spoke up again. "I'm sorry Shinji…that I wanted to break up with you. I never wanted to leave you, but I was so confused and angry…I wanted to prove myself that I could be independent, and now I'm paying my debt for it…"  
明日香再次痛苦地叫了一声，深呼吸了几下后才再次开口。“对不起，真嗣…我曾想和你分手。我从没想过离开你，但我当时太困惑和愤怒了…我想证明自己能独立，现在我为此付出了代价…”

It was the end...so why wouldn't she be honest with him?  
一切都要结束了…所以她为何不对他坦诚相待呢？

"Please stop Asuka," Shinji said in a pleading voice. He wanted to move over and pull her out of the entry plug, but his EVA was impaled to the ground by the replica of the Lance of Longinus. "I understand why you did it! I never held it against you!"  
“请停下来，明日香，”真嗣用恳求的语气说道。他想挪过去把她从插入栓里拉出来，但他的 EVA 被仿制的朗基努斯之枪钉在了地上。“我理解你为什么这么做！我从没有因此怨恨你！”

"This is the end, really…" Asuka said as she touched several specific places on the DSS Choker, activating it as how Dr. Akagi had instructed her to do. "Up until now, I don't think I deserve to live anymore…if I stay alive, I'm robbing everyone else's future away." As she spoke, the DSS Choker started to lit up, a dozen rhombus-shaped columns started circling around Asuka's neck. "Perhaps not including your future…I mean, you can still meet the next me, right? I bet you've been through this many times, this should be just another Thursday."  
“这真的是终点了…”明日香说着，触摸了 DSS 项圈上的几个特定位置，按照赤木律子博士的指示激活了它。“直到现在，我觉得自己已经不配再活下去了…如果我继续活着，就是在剥夺其他人未来的机会。”她说话间，DSS 项圈开始亮起，十几根菱形柱围绕着她的脖子旋转。“也许不包括你的未来…我是说，你还能遇到下一个我，对吧？我猜你已经经历过很多次了，这应该只是又一个星期四。”

She chuckled. 她轻声笑了。

"It's just that…I don't want things between _us_, to end like this…"  
"只是……我不希望我们之间的关系就这样结束……"

Shinji listened in silence as he found himself unable to come up with a single word.  
真嗣沉默地听着，发现自己一个字也说不出来。

"Maybe you never saw me differently, but I can't think of it that way. I am different from _other_ Asukas."  
"也许你从未以不同的眼光看待我，但我无法那样想。我和其他的明日香不一样。"

"I don't want you to think that _I_ hated you when you think of _me..."_  
"我不想让你想起我时，以为我恨你……"

"In fact, I never did. I just…" Asuka sighed. "You gave me the happiest period of my entire life…I never thought I'd need anything else other than my EVA, but you proved me wrong. I could never thank you enough for it."  
"事实上，我从未恨过你。我只是……" 明日香叹了口气。"你给了我一生中最快乐的时光……我从未想过除了我的 EVA 还需要别的什么，但你让我改变了想法。我永远无法为此感谢你足够多。"

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

The entire command deck fell in utter silence as they listened to the likely last exchange between the two lovers. The girls soon found their faces wet, though they weren't surprised. Aoba and Makoto simply stared at their screens, feeling the tsunami of sadness wash over them. There were questions, but they could wait.  
整个指挥舱陷入了彻底的沉默，他们聆听着这对恋人可能的最后一次交流。女孩们很快发现自己的脸颊湿润了，尽管她们并不惊讶。青叶和真希波只是盯着他们的屏幕，感受着悲伤的海啸席卷而来。有些问题，但它们可以等待。

The redhead could feel the pressure around her neck start to build up along with intensified heat. "The painting you drew for me…I didn't destroy it. I put it in my drawer. Maybe you can bring it to your next…life? If you can't, I want you to promise…my last request for you…that you will draw another one for the next me…alright? I like it so much...I'm sure she'll like it, too."  
红发女子能感觉到颈部的压力逐渐增大，伴随着愈发强烈的热度。“你为我画的那幅画……我没有毁掉它。我把它放在抽屉里了。也许你可以在你的下一世带来它？如果不行，我想要你承诺……我对你最后的请求……你会为下一个我再画一幅……好吗？我非常喜欢它……我相信她也会喜欢的。”

"Just...be more honest with her, okay?"  
“只是……对她更坦诚些，好吗？”

"I…I promise." Shinji replied almost on autopilot as he refused to believe what was happening.  
“我……我承诺。”真嗣几乎是下意识地回答，他拒绝相信眼前发生的一切。

What else could he say, though?  
他还能说什么呢？

"Maybe…maybe _she_'ll never forgive you…" Even though Asuka didn't specify who she was, Shinji knew perfectly well whom she was referring to.  
“也许……也许她永远不会原谅你……”尽管明日香没有指明是谁，但真嗣很清楚她指的是谁。

"I can forgive you, Shinji."  
“我可以原谅你，真嗣。”

The brightness of the DSS Choker made a sharp increase as it exploded.  
DSS 项圈的亮度急剧增加，随后爆炸了。

People say when one's about to die, their whole life would flash before their eyes like a slideshow. Asuka smiled as her happy life moments with Shinji displayed. She had never thought she could ever be happy again, but one person proved it wrong.  
人们常说，当一个人即将死去时，他们的整个人生会像幻灯片一样在眼前闪现。明日香微笑着，看着与真嗣共度的快乐时光一幕幕展现。她从未想过自己还能再次感到幸福，但有一个人证明了这是可能的。

It was enough for her, wasn't it?  
这对她来说已经足够了，不是吗？

XXXXXX

With a blinding flash of light, the video feed to Unit 02 shut off before the giant mech slumped over. Shinji stared at the whole scene in utter silence.  
随着一道刺眼的光芒闪过，02 号机甲的视频信号突然中断，巨大的机甲随之倾倒。真嗣凝视着这一幕，完全陷入了沉默。

"Pilot Soryu…her life signs are gone…"  
“丽……她的生命迹象消失了……”

Maya's words didn't really register in his mind, though. His brain just shut off to protect itself from taking more damage.  
尽管如此，玛雅的话并没有真正进入他的脑海。他的大脑只是关闭了，以保护自己免受更多的伤害。

Just like Asuka said, he had seen her die many times before, it should be nothing to him already, shouldn't it?  
正如明日香所说，他之前已经多次目睹她的死亡，这应该对他来说已经不算什么了，不是吗？

But why did every time it happen, it would only hurt more?  
但为什么每次发生时，只会让他更加痛苦？

This time, they had won. They defeated the EVA series. They were on the victorious side in the endgame. The third Impact was averted. Lilith was destroyed, and he could demolish Adam easily. Everything would return to normal.  
这一次，他们赢了。他们击败了 EVA 系列。他们在最终游戏中站在了胜利的一方。第三次冲击被阻止了。莉莉丝被摧毁，而他可以轻易地消灭亚当。一切都将恢复正常。

He could finally live a normal life as a teenager without anything EVA-related. He could meet new people, establish a family, maybe even-  
他终于可以作为一个普通青少年生活，不再与 EVA 有任何瓜葛。他可以结识新朋友，建立家庭，甚至可能——

But Asuka would never be in this world anymore.  
但明日香将永远不会再存在于这个世界上了。

After all he had been through…  
毕竟他经历了那么多……

The only thing that mattered to him was only one person.  
对他来说，唯一重要的只有一个人。

Fortunately, he knew there was one way to deal with it.  
幸运的是，他知道有一种方法可以应对。

Shinji willed Unit 01 to put both of its hands around the replica of the Lance of Longinus that had its tip stuck on the purple EVA's chest.  
真嗣命令初号机用双手环绕住那把长枪的复制品，其尖端刺入了紫色 EVA 的胸膛。

"Shinji! What are you doing?!" Misato's frantic cries came through the speakers, though he barely paid attention to them. He would leave this world to the people that deserved it.  
“真嗣！你在做什么？！”美里透过扬声器传来的焦急呼喊，但他几乎没去理会。他要把这个世界留给那些值得拥有它的人。

This way, Adam would be destroyed as well. Without Lilith and Adam, the people in this world could finally live safely and normally.  
这样一来，亚当也会被摧毁。没有了莉莉丝和亚当，这个世界的人们终于可以安全、正常地生活了。

With a sad smile, Shinji started to push the Lance into Unit 01's core.  
带着一丝苦笑，真嗣开始将长枪推进零号机的核心。

Just as the Lance was about to penetrate the core along with the entry plug behind it, time seemed to slow down as Yui's voice echoed through the cockpit.  
正当长枪即将刺入核心，连同背后的插入栓一起，时间仿佛慢了下来，Yui 的声音在驾驶舱内回荡。

_Have you finally done it? Is this the world you want? Without Third Impact happening?  
你终于做到了吗？这就是你想要的世界吗？没有第三次冲击发生？_

He had to admit, though, that saving the world from Third Impact was indeed his very first objective. It was only after so many cycles of pain and sorrow he changed his motives.  
他不得不承认，拯救世界免于第三次冲击确实是他的首要目标。只是在经历了无数次的痛苦与悲伤之后，他的动机才发生了变化。

_Yes…_ So He thought. _But…_  
是的…他曾这样想。但是…

_But at what cost? 但代价是什么？_

_Everything… 一切…_

_I've lost everything…everything that matters to me in this world…  
我失去了所有……这个世界上对我至关重要的所有……_

"I'll see you around, Asuka…"  
“我们还会再见面的，明日香……”

The replica of the Lance pierced through.  
那把长枪的复制品贯穿了过来。

Shinji's vision turned white.  
真嗣的视野变得一片空白。

## *Chapter 44*: Chapter 44: Fulfillment  
*第四十四章*: 第四十四章：圆满

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

**Chapter 44: Fulfillment 第四十四章：圆满**

Shinji Ikari stared at the black speaker held in his left hand with lifeless eyes. To him, Asuka's death had just happened mere minutes ago. Tears won't come, though. His tears had already run dry by the time, after all the hardships and ordeals he had been through.  
碇真嗣无神地凝视着左手中的黑色扬声器。对他而言，明日香的死仿佛就发生在几分钟前。然而，泪水却无法涌出。毕竟，经历了那么多磨难与考验，他的泪水早已流尽。

He had been crying when he saw Asuka die during early cycles, but he soon found it unnecessary. It wasn't like he could change anything. The only thing he could do was bury the pain at the deepest level of his heart, clean out the wounds, and move on to his new chance.  
他在早期循环中目睹明日香死去时曾哭泣过，但很快发现这并无必要。他无法改变任何事。唯一能做的，便是将痛苦深埋心底，清理伤口，然后迎接新的机会。

But…he was so close…  
但是……他离得那么近……

He had saved the world…at the cost of losing his own world.  
他拯救了世界……却失去了自己的世界。

Was it a worthy trade?  
这是值得的交易吗？

Where could he ever find his redemption? From _her_?  
他能在何处寻得救赎？从她那里？

Shinji's grip on the speaker was so tight that the plastic material began to creak. He didn't need to hear what it was saying. He had heard it so many times that he could practically speak the lines with the exact tone.  
真嗣紧握着话筒，塑料材质因压力而发出吱吱声。他不需要听对方说什么，这些话他已经听过无数次，几乎能用同样的语调背诵出来。

He had failed. Again. Well, not exactly a complete failure – for the first time ever since his loops started, one of the worlds was saved. People in there could live their normal lives without the threat of Angels anymore. Lilith and Adam were both destroyed; they couldn't build more EVAs even if they wanted.  
他又失败了。又一次。不过，这并非彻底的失败——自他的循环开始以来，这是第一次有一个世界被拯救。那里的人们可以过上正常生活，不再受使徒威胁。莉莉丝和亚当都被摧毁了；即使他们想，也无法再制造更多的 EVA。

But... 但是...

"I'm sorry…Asuka…" Sighing, he placed the speaker back onto the telephone.  
“对不起……明日香……”他叹了口气，将话筒放回电话上。

Turning his head to the direction where he knew Ayanami's phantom vision would show up, Shinji waited for the insignia of the start of a new cycle. Taking a deep inhale, he thought of what should he do in this new cycle.  
转头望向心中知晓绫波幻影会出现的方向，真嗣等待着新循环开始的标志。深吸一口气，他思索着在这个新循环中应该做些什么。

He had to admit, though, that working with his father, at least on the surface, turned out better than he had initially thought. Gendo Ikari had been nothing but helpful. Every time Asuka got hurt was because of nothing but his own careless actions.  
不过，他不得不承认，至少表面上与父亲合作的结果比他最初预想的要好。碇源堂一直都很帮忙。每次明日香受伤，都是因为他自己的疏忽大意。

"What are you doing here, young boy?"  
“你在这里做什么，小男孩？”

Shinji snapped his head around, just to see an unfamiliar old man standing not far away from him and looking at him with a slightly irritated expression. "You've been standing here for a long time. Have you finished your call already?"  
真嗣猛地转过头，只见一位陌生的老人站在不远处，带着些许不悦的表情看着他。“你在这里站了很久了。电话打完了吗？”

Shinji frowned. This wasn't right. He had never seen this man ever before. What's stranger, Rei Ayanami's phantom vision hadn't appeared yet.  
真嗣皱起眉头。这不对劲。他从未见过这个男人。更奇怪的是，绫波零的幻影还未出现。

It didn't really matter to him, though, because Sachiel was showing up at any moment. "Sorry for the inconvenience, Mister, but I think you'd better find a shelter."  
不过这对他来说并不重要，因为萨基尔随时都可能出现。“抱歉给您添麻烦了，先生，但我想您最好找个避难所。”

"A shelter?" The old man's expression turned confused. "What for? We aren't in a war."  
"避难所？" 老人的表情变得困惑。"为什么？我们又不在打仗。"

Of course they weren't in an ordinary war. How could he even explain to him that there would be some extraterrestrial creatures that wanted to wipe out the entire humanity for their own survival, anyway? "Haven't you heard the alarms?"  
当然，他们所处的并非寻常战争。他该如何向老人解释，会有一些外星生物为了自己的生存而企图灭绝全人类呢？"你没听到警报声吗？"

"Alarms?" The old man's frown deepened. "Haven't heard one of them since World War two."  
"警报声？" 老人的眉头皱得更深了。"自从二战以来，我就没听到过那种东西。"

Shinji blinked. There was definitely something wrong. He reached to his pocket, trying to take out the picture Misato sent him for identification purposes.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。肯定有什么不对劲。他伸手去口袋里，试图拿出美里为了识别目的寄给他的照片。

And found nothing. 却发现什么都没有。

Wide-eyed, Shinji snapped his head back at the telephone booth, picked up the speaker, and dialed Misato's number.  
瞪大眼睛，真嗣猛地回头看向电话亭，拿起话筒，拨通了美里的号码。

_"Du…Du…Sorry, the number you dialed is unallocated…(music)…Hey there! Thanks for using this landline service provided by Hakone Suburban local government. If you have any questions…"  
"嘟…嘟…对不起，您拨打的号码是空号…(音乐)…嗨！感谢您使用箱根郊区政府提供的固定电话服务。如果您有任何疑问…"_

"I'm sorry," said Shinji as he dashed away from the telephone booth as if he got an electronic shock, leaving a very confused elder standing in front of the telephone booth.  
"对不起，" 真嗣说着，像被电击了一样从电话亭冲了出去，留下一位非常困惑的老人站在电话亭前。

XXXXXX

Running down the busy street full of people, Shinji's heart raced – not only because of the amount of movement he was making, but also that he couldn't make sense of his surroundings. Shouldn't they all be in shelters right now? And why hadn't Sachiel attacked yet?  
在挤满人群的繁忙街道上奔跑，真嗣的心跳加速——不仅是因为他正在进行的运动量，还因为他无法理解周围的环境。他们现在不应该都在避难所里吗？而且为什么萨基尔还没有发动攻击？

As he went past more city areas that people he asked called _Hakone_, Shinji could notice significant differences in the surroundings from what he had remembered. Buildings were taller, there were more cars and people, not to mention the lack of wreckage and flooding.  
当他穿过更多被询问者称为箱根的城市区域时，真嗣能明显察觉到周围环境与他记忆中的大相径庭。建筑物更高了，车辆和行人也更多，更不用说没有废墟和洪水了。

What the hell is going on?  
这到底是怎么回事？

After almost half an hour of non-stop running, Shinji finally became exhausted and fell down on a small lawn at a corner inside a park. He didn't even know what he was supposed to do, or where to go. He could go to where the Geofront was supposed to be, but he doubted he had to go there on foot.  
在近乎半小时的不停奔跑后，真嗣终于筋疲力尽，跌坐在公园一角的一片小草坪上。他甚至不知道自己该做什么，该去哪里。他本可以去到地底都市原本所在的地方，但他怀疑自己是否需要徒步前往。

After all, he didn't bring that much money with him.  
毕竟，他并没有带太多钱在身上。

"Damn it." “该死。”

Did the Geofront even _exist_ anymore?  
地底都市还存在吗？

What changed to cause such a massive ramification?  
是什么变化导致了如此巨大的影响？

But where else was he supposed to go?  
但他还能去哪儿呢？

It was only then Shinji realized the irony of his situation. He was a time traveler that could literally decide the fate of the entire world under several circumstances, a person who had his foot stepped on the doorway to godhood. And now he had to worry about his survival because he might starve to death if he didn't get food soon enough.  
直到那时，真嗣才意识到自己处境的讽刺之处。他是一个能决定世界命运的时间旅行者，在某些情况下，他甚至踏入了神性的门槛。而现在，他却不得不担心自己的生存问题，因为如果不能及时找到食物，他可能会饿死。

Fortunately, no Angel alarms also meant that the trains were working fine. Slowly, Shinji dragged his feet toward the train station.  
幸运的是，没有使徒警报也意味着列车运行正常。慢慢地，真嗣拖着脚步向车站走去。

Unsurprisingly, there wasn't even a station called Tokyo-3.  
不出所料，连个叫第三新东京市的车站都没有。

Perhaps getting on the train that would go to "downtown direction" was a good idea.  
或许搭乘前往“市中心方向”的列车是个好主意。

Sitting quietly with his SDAT in hand, Shinji tried his best to ignore the scenes people around him were making. He felt like it was the first time all over again - when he ran away from the EVA after the fight against the Fourth Angel.  
静静地坐着，手里握着 SDAT，真嗣尽力忽视周围人们制造的场景。他感觉仿佛一切又回到了原点——那次在与第四使徒战斗后逃离 EVA 的时刻。

He wanted to shut himself off from the people around him. He just wanted to be left alone and think about his future – or rather, where he's going to have his next meal.  
他想要将自己与周围的人隔离开来。他只想独自一人，思考自己的未来——或者更确切地说，下一顿饭去哪里吃。

Even though Shinji had acquired dozens of skills during his cycles, his age was still below legal working age in Japan. No mattered how skilled he was in cooking, there was no way a restaurant would just hire and pay him against the law.  
尽管真嗣在多个周期中掌握了数十种技能，但他的年龄仍未达到日本法定工作年龄。无论他在烹饪上有多么熟练，没有一家餐厅会违法雇佣并支付他薪水。

Shinji kept his gaze directed at the outside through the window as the train clattered across the landscape. There were no signs of destruction or apocalypse, only prosperity and life.  
真嗣透过车窗凝视着外面的景色，火车在风景中咔嗒咔嗒地行驶。没有毁灭或末日的迹象，只有繁荣与生命。

A world he had never seen ever before.  
这是一个他从未见过的世界。

He could only find solace from the fact that at least the date shown on the train's calendar was correct.  
他只能从火车日历上显示的日期是正确的这一事实中找到些许安慰。

As the train approached its destination, Shinji could start to recognize familiar terrains such as mountains and rivers. Though something else was still missing – the turrets, missile launchers, weaponry buildings, and EVA launch shafts.  
随着列车接近目的地，真嗣开始能辨认出熟悉的山川地形。然而，有些东西依然缺失——炮塔、导弹发射器、武器建筑以及 EVA 发射井。

Only a small city stood there.  
那里仅矗立着一座小城。

_"Dear passengers, we're approaching Hakone Railway Station. Please check your baggage and make sure to…"  
“尊敬的乘客们，我们即将抵达箱根火车站。请检查您的行李，并确保……”_

The mechanical voice that came out of the PA system brought Shinji back to reality. Thankfully the train station he could identify very well – it looked almost exactly like the station he came to when he tried to ran away the first time.  
从 PA 系统传出的机械声音将真嗣拉回了现实。幸运的是，这个火车站他非常熟悉——它看起来几乎和他第一次试图逃跑时到达的那个车站一模一样。

Which also meant he could find his way to the Geofront entrances…  
这也意味着他能找到通往 Geofront 入口的路……

But Shinji knew he would never find them. Because the Geofront didn't exist anymore.  
但真嗣知道他永远找不到它们。因为 Geofront 已经不复存在了。

He still had to get off the train, though. Sighing, Shinji exited the train station and began wandering aimlessly around the city. The natural sights were all there, Lake Ashi, the hills – but everything else was different.  
尽管如此，他还是得下火车。叹了口气，真嗣走出火车站，开始在城市中漫无目的地游荡。自然景观依旧，芦之湖、山丘——但其他一切都变了。

Tokyo-3 possessed several skyscrapers. But right now, none was in sight.  
第三新东京市拥有几座摩天大楼。但此刻，一座也看不见。

"I hate this," Shinji mumbled to himself. He had already remembered every street of Tokyo-3 and important places. He might as well be a human Navigation app, but now he didn't even know the name of the road he was walking on. The only thing he could do was walk in a general direction – a direction he chose after a serious thought.  
“我讨厌这样，”真嗣自言自语道。他已经记住了第三新东京市的每一条街道和重要地点。他几乎可以算是一个人形导航应用了，但现在他甚至不知道自己走的路叫什么名字。他唯一能做的就是朝着一个大致的方向走——这个方向是他经过深思熟虑后选择的。

The Katsuragi Residence. 葛城宅邸。

XXXXXX

"Gods be praised!" Shinji exclaimed as the familiar apartment complex came into his field of view. Even though he could still notice several discrepancies from his memories, it was the only thing he could recognize in the city so far.  
"感谢神明！" 真嗣惊叹道，当熟悉的公寓楼映入眼帘。尽管他仍能察觉到与记忆中的些许差异，但这是他在城市中迄今唯一能辨认出的地方。

Though Shinji's face quickly fell as a more realistic idea showed up in his mind. For all he knew, the differences in this world were so enormous it might as well be sky and earth. The only reason Misato came to Tokyo-3 was that she wanted to have her revenge against the Angels. Why would she come to such a remote place if – no matter how much he had a hard time believing – that Angels weren't even a thing?  
尽管如此，当一个更现实的念头浮现在脑海时，真嗣的脸色迅速黯淡下来。据他所知，这个世界的差异如此巨大，简直可以说是天壤之别。Misato 来到第三新东京市的唯一原因，是她想要向使徒复仇。如果——尽管他很难相信——使徒根本不存在，她又为何会来到这样一个偏远之地呢？

Still, it wasn't like there was another place he could go to, was there?  
不过，他也没有其他地方可去，不是吗？

He could go to his school, of course, assuming it still existed. The purpose wasn't going to be anything else but merely checking how much of the world had changed. Since it seemed like there were no EVAs anymore, class 2-A, a class full of potential pilots, wouldn't exist anymore, right?  
他当然可以去他的学校，假设它还存在的话。此行的目的无非是看看世界究竟改变了多少。既然似乎已经没有 EVA 了，那么充满潜在驾驶员的 2-A 班，也就不复存在了吧？

Was he supposed to meet new people from now on? Shinji didn't really find himself scared of the idea, though. He had already mastered the art of social interactions, he was sure that he could make new friends if he wanted.  
从今往后，他是否应该结识新朋友呢？不过，真嗣并不觉得这个想法令他害怕。他确信自己已经掌握了社交的艺术，只要愿意，交到新朋友对他来说不成问题。

But did it really matter?  
但这一切真的重要吗？

After all, the only person he cared about was _her._  
毕竟，他唯一在乎的人就是她。

Where was she? Did she even _exist?_  
她在哪里？她真的存在吗？

Violently shaking the dark thoughts off, Shinji made his way to the elevator. The apartment building, aside from certain differences in the patterns, possessed much more residents as well.  
猛地甩开那些阴暗的思绪，真嗣走向电梯。这座公寓楼，除了某些图案上的差异外，住户也多了不少。

It was understandable, though. The main reason people left this area was because of the Angel attacks. Now that those things weren't a concern anymore, no reason for people to not live in such a cost-effective place.  
不过这可以理解。人们离开这个地区的主要原因是因为使徒的袭击。既然那些东西不再是问题，没有理由不选择这样一个性价比高的地方居住。

The elevator door slid open with a screeching metal sound. Shinji walked toward the door where the Katsuragi Residence was supposed to be, no hurry in his pace since he knew it wouldn't change the outcome. Though it didn't get him rid of the nervous feeling that intensified with each passing moment.  
电梯门伴随着刺耳的金属摩擦声缓缓打开。真嗣走向本应是葛城家所在的门口，步伐并不匆忙，因为他知道这不会改变结果。尽管如此，随着时间的推移，他越发紧张的感觉并未因此减轻。

"Hey, Shinji-kun!" “嘿，真嗣君！”

Hearing the familiar voice, the boy snapped his head around, just to see Misato Katsuragi standing in the hallway and looking at him with a smile. She wore some type of uniform, but from the lack of stripe and stars on her shoulder, Shinji knew it wasn't a military uniform.  
听到熟悉的声音，男孩猛地转过头，只见葛城美里站在走廊里，微笑着看着他。她穿着某种制服，但从肩上没有条纹和星星来看，真嗣知道那不是军装。

At first, he didn't even know what he should feel. Perhaps he should be happy about it, that Misato existed, and apparently, she knew him. Or, maybe precisely because Misato knew him, he probably should feel scared about it.  
起初，他甚至不知道自己应该有什么感觉。也许他应该为此感到高兴，美里存在，而且显然，她认识他。或者，正是因为美里认识他，他可能应该为此感到害怕。

"Ah, hi, Misato-san," Shinji made a hasty reply and waited for her to continued their conversation, not knowing what he was supposed to say.  
“啊，嗨，美里小姐，”真嗣匆忙回应，等待她继续对话，不知道自己该说什么。

At least, Misato wasn't surprised to see him here. It's probably a good thing.  
至少，美里看到他在这里并不惊讶。这可能是件好事。

Misato let out a chuckle, waving her hand. "What are you doing here, anyway? Now it's weekend, you can't be here for homework help, can you?"  
美里轻笑一声，挥了挥手。“你在这里做什么呢？现在可是周末，你总不会是来求助作业的吧？”

Homework help? A frown crossed Shinji's face. Even if the homework part was at least understandable since technically he was still a teenager at schooling age, how could Misato help him with his homework, anyway? "No, actually…" Suddenly an idea flashed into Shinji's mind. "I'm lost and can't get back to my home."  
作业辅导？真嗣皱起了眉头。尽管从技术上讲，他仍处于上学年龄，作业部分尚可理解，但 Misato 究竟如何能帮他完成作业呢？“不，实际上……”突然，一个念头闪过真嗣的脑海。“我迷路了，找不到回家的路。”

It was indeed a risky play, though. He only did it since now that he knew the Katsuragi Residence wasn't his home here.  
这确实是一场冒险的举动，不过。他之所以这么做，是因为他现在知道高坂家并不是他在这里的家。

"Eh?" Misato showed him a clear surprised expression. "Are you okay today, Shinji-kun?" She reached out to him with her hand and put it on his forehead, testing his temperature. "No fever…weird."  
“诶？”美里露出明显的惊讶表情，“你今天还好吗，真嗣君？”她伸手摸了摸他的额头，试探他的体温，“没有发烧……奇怪。”

Shinji pulled away from her in exasperation. "I feel fine, Misato-san, just…a bit lost." He said, executing his technically true maneuver.  
真嗣有些恼火地躲开了她，“我感觉很好，美里小姐，只是……有点迷茫。”他说道，执行了他那句技术上真实的操作。

"But you never got lost before, and your home is several kilometers that way, away from the downtown area," now it was Misato's turn to be confused. "You came here before, how could you-"  
"但你以前从未迷路过，你的家在那边几公里外，远离市中心区域，" 现在轮到美里困惑了。"你之前来过这里，怎么可能-"

"Thank you, Misato-san!" Shinji cut her off. He didn't need to raise more suspicion than he already did. Not to mention that only one residential area he could remember resided in that direction.  
"谢谢你，美里小姐！" 真嗣打断了她。他不需要引起更多的怀疑，更不用说，他只记得那个方向有一个住宅区。

Rei Ayanami's apartments.  
绫波丽的公寓。

XXXXXX

Shinji's eyes lit up as the apartment complexes came into his field of view. Thankfully, the buildings looked nothing like Rei's apartment other than the unmistakable shape. There were clearly many people living in there, and the exterior of the building looked new and well-flourished.  
当公寓楼群映入眼帘时，真嗣的眼睛亮了起来。幸运的是，这些建筑除了那明显的形状外，与绫波的公寓毫无相似之处。显然，这里居住着许多人，建筑外观新颖且保养得很好。

As he approached the community, people he couldn't even recognize started giving him greetings, from simple nods to vocal ones. He greeted back, of course, but without the mention of their names – it wasn't like he knew them in the first place.  
当他走近社区时，一些他甚至认不出的人开始向他打招呼，从简单的点头到出声问候。他当然也回以问候，但没有提及他们的名字——毕竟他原本就不认识他们。

Though it was a good sign – apparently, he was getting close to his' home'.  
尽管这是个好迹象——显然，他离自己的'家'越来越近了。

"Hey, Shin-man!" Just as he walked past the entrance of one of the buildings, the familiar Toji's voice reached him from inside. "Where did you go? Ken and I came to find you, and you weren't home!"  
"嘿，真嗣！" 正当他走过一栋建筑的入口时，从里面传来了熟悉的战士（Toji）的声音。"你去哪儿了？我和剑介来找你，你却不在家！"

If anything, Shinji only found himself relaxed that he didn't need to worry about not knowing where his home was anymore. Knowing that Toji and Kensuke existed and were obviously friends with him was good, but for now, it was pretty low on his concern list. "I had…some business to attend to," said Shinji as he entered the building. "Good to see you today, guys."  
如果说有什么让他感到放松的话，那就是他不再需要担心不知道自己的家在哪里了。知道托吉和剑介存在并且显然是他的朋友是件好事，但目前，这在他的担忧清单上排名相当低。"我有些事情要处理，"真嗣说着走进了建筑。"今天见到你们真好，伙计们。"

"Yeah, and we came here today because Ken's going to…ah, film warship Atago that would be docking tomorrow," Toji said after they entered the elevator and pressed the button.  
"是啊，我们今天来这里是因为剑介要……呃，拍摄明天将要停靠的驱逐舰爱宕，" 托吉在他们进入电梯并按下按钮后说道。"

"It's a DDG, not _warship,_" Kensuke gave him an exasperated look.  
“这是驱逐舰，不是战舰。”健介无奈地看了他一眼。

"It's a ship built for war, so it's a warship," Toji countered.  
“这是一艘为战争而建的船，所以它是一艘战舰。”透司反驳道。

Kensuke shrugged, giving up on getting the way of military otaku through Toji's thick skull.  
健介耸了耸肩，放弃了向冬二那颗顽固的军事宅脑袋灌输理念。

Moments later, the elevator arrived at the floor which Toji chose, the trio then exited the box and headed off. During the entire process, Shinji simply followed his friends' steps since he had no idea which one was his home.  
片刻后，电梯到达了 Toji 选择的楼层，三人随即走出电梯，继续前行。整个过程中，Shinji 只是默默跟随朋友们的步伐，因为他根本不知道哪一间是自己的家。

His question was soon answered as they came to a stop in front of a door that had a nameplate with 'Ikari Residence' imprinted on it.  
他的疑问很快得到了解答，因为他们停在了一扇门前，门上的名牌上刻着'碇宅'的字样。

_Ding Dong 叮咚_

"Coming!" A female voice called out from inside the room.  
“来了！”房间内传来一个女性的声音。

A shiver ran down Shinji's spine as he immediately recognized the voice.  
听到这个声音，真嗣不由得打了个寒颤，他立刻认出了这是谁的声音。

The door slid open, just to reveal a smile-wearing Yui Ikari standing in the doorway. She was wearing casual home clothes, unlike the white lab coat that Shinji had always remembered. "Het guys, please come in!"  
门缓缓滑开，站在门口的是面带微笑的碇唯，她穿着休闲的家居服，与真嗣记忆中总是穿着白色实验服的形象截然不同。“嘿，大家请进！”

"Thanks, Yui-san!" Toji and Kensuke happily complied and rushed into the apartment.  
"谢谢，Yui 女士！" 冬二和健介高兴地答应着，急忙冲进了公寓。

"So, how was your trip today, Shinji?" Yui asked with a smile.  
"那么，你今天的旅行怎么样，真嗣？" Yui 微笑着问道。

"Fine, I guess," Shinji replied, eliciting raised eyebrows from his mother. He soon realized his mistake – a normal fourteen-year-old teenager wouldn't speak with a tone he used. "Sorry, just really tired."  
"还好吧，我想，" 真嗣回答道，这让他的母亲挑起了眉毛。他很快意识到自己的错误——一个普通的十四岁少年不会用他那种语气说话。"对不起，只是真的很累。"

Yui's expression turned understanding and concerned in an instant. "Okay. Come and sit down, I'll get you some water."  
优的表情瞬间变得理解且关切。“好的。过来坐下，我去给你倒点水。”

Shinji smiled a sheepish smile and headed to the living room.  
真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，走向客厅。

Just to meet the sight of Gendo Ikari sitting on the chair beside the dining table reading a newspaper.  
却见碇源堂正坐在餐桌旁的椅子上，读着报纸。

"What's on the news today, darling?" Asked Yui as she dumped water into the cup.  
"今天新闻有什么，亲爱的？" 优一边说，一边往杯子里倒水。

"Hm." It was Gendo's only response.  
"嗯。" 这是源堂唯一的回应。

"Will you move your eyes off that newspaper for one second, darling?"  
"你能把眼睛从那张报纸上移开一秒钟吗，亲爱的？"

"Hm."

"Shinji's home. Shouldn't you at least say hi? What kind of father are you?" Yui sighed.  
"这里是真嗣的家。你至少该打个招呼吧？你算是什么样的父亲呢？" 绫叹了口气。

"Hello, Shinji." "你好，真嗣。"

The called boy chuckled and greeted back.  
被叫到的男孩轻笑一声，回以问候。

It was all clear now.  
现在一切都清楚了。

A world without EVAs and Angels.  
一个没有 EVA 和使徒的世界。

He finally did it, didn't he? His all-time purpose.  
他终于做到了，不是吗？他毕生的目标。

He had absolutely zero idea of what changed to create a world without EVAs and Angels. Perhaps because his last world went on without Third Impact. Or maybe it was the annihilation of both Lilith and Adam during his lastest cycle.  
他完全不知道是什么变化导致了这个世界没有了 EVA 和使徒。也许是因为他的上一个世界在没有第三次冲击的情况下继续发展。或者可能是因为在他最近的循环中，莉莉丝和亚当都被消灭了。

Did it really matter? 这真的重要吗？

What mattered was that he finally got out of everything.  
重要的是，他终于摆脱了一切。

But…something…no, _someone_ was missing…  
但是…有什么…不，某个人不在了…

This world was perfect, was it not?  
这个世界是完美的，不是吗？

Everybody here can live a happy and normal life without being threatened by the Angels. He didn't have Unit 01 anymore, so he couldn't end the world even if he wanted to.  
这里的每个人都能过上幸福而正常的生活，不再受到使徒的威胁。他没有初号机了，即使他想，也无法终结这个世界。

Shinji let out a sad laugh as he settled his eyes on his father again.  
真嗣发出了一声悲哀的笑，目光再次落在了父亲身上。

_Please bring me to Yui…  
请带我去见唯…_

Even Gendo Ikari's all-time wish was fulfilled. He could be together with Yui now. The only person he really cared about. Did he deserve it? It was hard to say. Still, Shinji knew for a fact that this would never happen without his father.  
就连碇源堂一直以来的愿望也实现了。他现在能和唯在一起了。他真正在乎的唯一一个人。他是否配得上这一切？这很难说。不过，真嗣确信，没有父亲，这一切永远不会发生。

But what about _himself?_ 但他自己呢？

_At what cost… 代价几何……_

Without the EVAs, there was no reason for Asuka to come to Japan in the first place. They would never meet again.  
没有了 EVA，明日香根本就没有理由来日本。他们将再也不会相遇。

Though it wasn't so bad.  
虽然也没那么糟糕。

She could have the love of her parents and never be a lonely girl ever again. She could meet new people in Germany and not be restrained by piloting the EVA any more. She could have her own happy and normal life as well, just like all other people.  
她可以拥有父母的关爱，再也不会是一个孤独的女孩。她可以在德国结识新朋友，不再受驾驶 EVA 的束缚。她也能拥有和其他人一样幸福而正常的生活。

A promising future for her.  
对她来说，未来充满希望。

This was what mattered to him the most, wasn't it?  
这正是他最在乎的，不是吗？

As long as she could live happily…  
只要她能幸福地生活……

He could be happy as well.  
他也能感到快乐。

But…

_Won't you be lonely? 你不会感到孤独吗？_

Shinji tried to convince himself that he had lived enough of life, but the argument was mercilessly slaughtered by the fact that all the life he lived so far was about EVAs and Angels. He had never experienced a normal life as a teenager ever before.  
真嗣试图说服自己他已经体验了足够多的人生，但这一论点被无情地击溃了，因为他迄今为止的生活全是关于 EVA 和使徒的。他从未作为一个青少年体验过正常的生活。

Now he had his own home as well. With all of the skills he obtained during the cycles, Shinji knew his life here would be like sailing with fair winds and following seas. He was not scared of it at all.  
如今，他也拥有了自己的家。凭借在轮回中获得的所有技能，真嗣知道在这里的生活将如同顺风顺水般顺畅。他对此毫不畏惧。

But was he able to move on? From _her?_  
但他能继续前进吗？从她身边？

Unfortunately, he knew the answer already.  
遗憾的是，他早已知晓答案。

Taking a deep breath, Shinji turned to his mother. "Hey, Mom?"  
深吸一口气，真嗣转向他的母亲。“嘿，妈妈？”

"Yes, darling?" Yui looked at him with a smile.  
“是的，亲爱的？” 由依微笑着看着他。

"I…um…the summer vacation is coming up, can we take a trip abroad?"  
“我…嗯…暑假快到了，我们可以去国外旅行吗？”

"What for?" Yui gave him a slightly confused expression. "Why the sudden interest?"  
"为什么？" 优衣略显困惑地看着他。"怎么突然感兴趣了？"

"Because…" He couldn't just say 'I have a girl there waiting for me,' could he? "I want to get some fresh air."  
"因为……" 他总不能说“那里有个女孩在等我”吧？"我想出去透透气。"

"Hm," Yui pondered. "Do you have any place in mind?"  
"嗯，" 优衣思索着。"你有没有什么特别想去的地方？"

"Europe?" Shinji said carefully. Mentioning 'Germany' would be too suspicion-arousing for its specificity. They had to go to Germany if they traveled to Europe, anyway. "I mean, that place has a very different culture than us. That's why I want to go there."  
"欧洲？" 真嗣小心翼翼地说道。提到“德国”会因其具体性而引起太多怀疑。无论如何，如果他们去欧洲旅行，都得去德国。"我的意思是，那个地方的文化与我们截然不同。这就是我想去那里的原因。"

"I'll think about it," Yui said.  
"我会考虑的，" 由依说。

It was understandable, though. Most parents would hesitate when their kids just suddenly brought up stuff like this – it wasn't like most kids know what they're doing.  
不过这可以理解。大多数父母在孩子突然提起这类话题时都会犹豫——毕竟大多数孩子并不清楚自己在做什么。

But Shinji wasn't a child.  
但真嗣已不再是孩子。

He knew what he was doing, and he also knew why he was doing it.  
他清楚自己在做什么，也明白为何要这么做。

But did he know _how_ he was going to do it?  
但他知道该怎么做吗？

What was he supposed to do? Their lives wouldn't have any intersections anymore. Even if he could go to Germany with his parents, how could he find her, anyway? Of course Shinji knew the address of Asuka's home in Berlin, but that was when the Soryu family was still associated with Gehirn, which apparently wasn't the case anymore.  
他应该做什么呢？他们的生活不会再有任何交集。即使他能随父母去德国，他又该如何找到她呢？当然，真嗣知道明日香在柏林的住址，但那是当惣流家还与 GEHRIN 有关联的时候，显然现在情况已非如此。

And even if he could find her in person, why would she want to have anything to do with him, anyway? Their bond, the EVA was lost. If anything, Asuka would be a normal teenage girl with a shining personality and beautiful look, a hot catch for people to claim. Shinji hated to think of it this way, but from the outside, he was no more than a typical young boy that was no match to his _competition -_ if he could actually be qualified to be considered one to others, that is.  
即便他能亲自找到她，她又为何还想与他有任何瓜葛呢？他们的纽带，EVA，已经消失了。如果说有什么不同，明日香现在只是一个性格鲜明、外貌美丽的普通少女，是众人追求的对象。真嗣不愿这样想，但从旁观者的角度看，他不过是一个普通的少年，根本无法与他的竞争对手相提并论——如果他真的有资格被别人视为竞争对手的话。

Not to mention they had already lost their most important connection…their childhoods.  
更别提他们已经失去了最重要的联系……他们的童年。

But Shinji still believed in love.  
但真嗣依然相信爱情。

Perhaps it was only an illusion created by the years after years of time he had spent with her, that Shinji refused to think otherwise.  
或许这只是他与她多年相处时光所营造的幻觉，真嗣不愿去想其他可能。

Still, no matter what, he had to face reality sooner than later.  
尽管如此，无论怎样，他迟早都得面对现实。

It's not like he had any other purpose than to make her happy…  
他除了让她开心之外，似乎也没有其他目的了……

Was she actually happy, though?  
但她真的快乐吗？

_'It's not about anything else. I just want to make sure that she's happy here.'_ He tried to convince himself with it. He didn't need to plan his own future for now, though. That could wait until the most critical business was finished.  
“这无关其他，我只希望她在这里能快乐。”他试图以此说服自己。虽然他目前无需规划自己的未来，但那可以等到最关键的事务完成后再说。

XXXXXX

It had been several days since his newest cycle started. Shinji was to go to school just like every other teenager at his age should - even though his grades absolutely slaughtered everyone else in his school.  
自他最新的循环开始以来，已经过去好几天了。真嗣像同龄的其他青少年一样去上学——尽管他的成绩绝对碾压学校里的所有人。

He had to act timid and shy himself all the time, though, considering many people here knew him.  
然而，他必须时刻表现得胆怯害羞，毕竟这里很多人认识他。

Today, he finally got a chance to test the water at the airport.  
今天，他终于有机会在机场试水了。

The airport was much smaller than he remembered for obvious reasons. He doubted the airport could provide international services with its short runways. Nevertheless, transportation was pretty much the last thing he had worry about for now.  
机场显然比他记忆中的要小得多。他怀疑这短小的跑道能否提供国际服务。不过，交通问题几乎是眼下他最不需要担心的。

Today he was just here to case the point, it wasn't like he had enough money, anyway.  
今天他只是来探探情况，毕竟他也没那么多钱。

"Hello," Shinji walked up in front of the ticket office, speaking to the seller. "I want a ticket to Germany, Berlin."  
“你好，” 真嗣走到售票窗口前，对售票员说，“我要一张去德国柏林的票。”

The ticket seller gave him a quizzical expression. "Um, kid, do you have parents?"  
售票员露出疑惑的表情。“呃，孩子，你有父母吗？”

"Well, I do, but they aren't here," Shinji replied.  
“嗯，我有，但他们不在这里，”真嗣回答道。

"I'm afraid that I can't help you, then." A professional and apologetic smile crossed the ticket seller's face. "I assume you aren't an adult, right? This way, you have to have a guardian who's older than 18 to travel with you."  
"恐怕我帮不了你。" 售票员脸上露出了职业而抱歉的微笑。"我猜你不是成年人，对吧？这样的话，你必须有一位 18 岁以上的监护人陪同才能旅行。"

Shinji made a slight frown. Truthfully, he never really took any international flights before – it wasn't like he needed to. Even though he had _some_ knowledge on the subject of matter, policies could be drastically different for all he knew.  
真嗣微微皱眉。说实话，他以前从未乘坐过国际航班——他并不需要。尽管他对这方面有所了解，但政策可能对他来说截然不同。

This world wasn't the world he remembered anymore.  
这个世界已不再是他所记忆的模样。

"But I really need to go there. It's urgent," Shinji said in an almost pleading voice. "Someone important to me is waiting for me."  
"但我的确需要去那里。情况紧急，" 真嗣几乎是用恳求的语气说道，"对我很重要的人正在等我。"

The ticket seller rubbed her chin for a moment. "Can you show me your ID? Passport?"  
售票员摸了摸下巴，思考了一会儿。"你能出示一下身份证件吗？护照？"

"I…" Shinji found no words to say. This was never a problem in all of his previous lives. "I don't have one."  
"我…" 真嗣发现自己无言以对。这在他的前几世中从未成为问题。"我没有。"

The ticket seller shrugged. In her eyes, he was nothing more than a young kid who hadn't been through a lot, so his behavior was understandable. "I'm sorry, then. There's nothing I can do to help you."  
售票员耸了耸肩。在她看来，他不过是个涉世未深的年轻人，所以他的行为可以理解。“那我无能为力了，抱歉。”

"Thanks." Shinji _sighed_ deeply and turned away from the counter. It seemed like he had no other way than to goad his parents to bring him on a trip to Germany. But when would it happen, though? How could he act that way privately? What would his parents think of him if he let them know his real goal?  
“谢谢。”真嗣深深叹了口气，转身离开柜台。看来他别无选择，只能怂恿父母带他去德国旅行。但那会是什么时候呢？他私下里该如何行动？如果让父母知道他的真实目的，他们会怎么想？

There was still a chance, though.  
不过，还有一线希望。

He felt his chest sore as he thought about her again. Even if he could actually find her, this one would never be the same person he knew ever again. The girl who was so fragile, yet so strong. The redhead who wanted to be forever independent, but would hide all of her pain and loneliness inside the deepest part of her heart.  
他再次想起她时，感到胸口一阵酸痛。即便他真的能找到她，这个她也不再是他所认识的那个人了。那个既脆弱又坚强的女孩。那个红发女孩渴望永远独立，却将所有的痛苦和孤独深藏于心底。

The Asuka in this world though…she would be nothing but a normal teenager.  
然而，这个世界的明日香……她只会是一个普通的少女。

She would never be _his_ Asuka.  
她永远不会是他的明日香。

Was he going to leave all of the EVA Pilot Asukas behind? What choices did he have, anyway?  
他打算留下所有的 EVA 驾驶员明日香吗？他究竟还有哪些选择呢？

All of them… 他们全都……

Feeling another presence behind him, Shinji sighed again and turned around.  
感受到身后另一个存在的气息，真嗣再次叹了口气，转过身来。

_Who?_

Blue eyes. Red hair. Slender body.  
蓝眼睛。红头发。苗条身材。

His cobalt eyes went wide along with hers.  
他的钴蓝色眼睛与她的同样睁大了。

They just kept staring at each other, neither of them said anything.  
他们只是继续凝视着对方，谁也没有开口。

Silence. 沉默。

He didn't think about why would she be here, or how. It didn't matter.  
他没有去想她为什么会在这里，或是怎么来的。这都不重要。

Time seemed to freeze. 时间仿佛凝固了。

No one knew how long it went before the girl spoke up first. "Why are you staring at me?" Her tone wasn't necessarily irritated, but…surprised? Even pained?  
没人知道过了多久，女孩首先开口了。“你为什么盯着我看？”她的语气并不一定是生气，但……惊讶？甚至是痛苦？

"I-I-" Shinji found himself at a loss for words. The girl in front of him looked just like her. Like Asuka.  
“我-我-” 真嗣发现自己语塞了。眼前的女孩看起来就像她。像明日香。

But something was different.  
但有些东西变得不同了。

Of course it wasn't the missing A-10 clips.  
当然，这并不是因为缺少了 A-10 夹子。

It was about her eyes.  
关键在于她的眼神。

They didn't look like what Shinji had always remembered. They weren't sparkling with fire and pride, trying to tell people that she was the most superior existence in the world. They were full of pain, sadness – they were the eyes of someone who had been through so much and lost so much, just like…  
它们并不像真嗣记忆中的那样。没有闪耀着火焰与骄傲，试图向世人宣告她是世界上最卓越的存在。它们充满了痛苦和悲伤——就像经历了太多、失去了太多的人的眼睛，就像……

Just like his own eyes.  
就像他自己的眼睛一样。

She must've noticed how his eyes looked as well.  
她一定也注意到了他的眼神。

"I found you really pretty," it was all he could come up with at the moment.  
"我觉得你真的很漂亮，" 这是他当时唯一能想到的话。

He could see her raise eyebrows but soon regain her composure. "Too bad, I already have someone who loves me and whom I love." She tried not to break their eye contact.  
他看到她挑了挑眉，但很快恢复了镇定。"太遗憾了，我已经有了爱我的人，我也爱他。" 她尽量不打破他们的眼神交流。

"Is it me?" He forced himself to smirk.  
"是我吗？" 他强迫自己露出微笑。

"Who are you?" She frowned. This time, though, Shinji could clearly see the surprise, even _shock,_ from her sapphire eyes, as if she wasn't expecting those words to come out from his mouth at all.  
"你是谁？" 她皱起眉头。这一次，尽管如此，真嗣可以清楚地从她蓝宝石般的眼睛中看到惊讶，甚至是震惊，仿佛她完全没有预料到这些话会从他嘴里说出来。

But why would she _expect_ anything from him, anyway? It's not like she knew him already, was it?  
但无论如何，她为什么会期待从他那里得到什么呢？她又不认识他，不是吗？

"I am Shinji Ikari, nice to meet you."  
“我是碇真嗣，很高兴见到你。”

"Well I am Asuka Langley Soryu."  
"嗯，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

Both of them fell silent once more.  
两人再次陷入了沉默。

"What are you doing here, anyway?" This time Shinji started first. "You surely don't look Japanese to me."  
“你到底在这里做什么？”这次是真嗣先开口，“你看起来可不像日本人。”

"To find someone." “来找人。”

"Is it me?" Shinji smirked again.  
"是我吗？" 真嗣再次微微一笑。

"Perhaps, perhaps not." "或许吧，或许不是。"

"Where are your parents?"  
"你的父母在哪里？"

"Baggage claim." "行李提取处。"

"It's really nice to have parents who love you, isn't it?"  
"有爱你的父母真是太好了，不是吗？"

"Don't tell me you don't have them. Gott that would be pathetic."  
"别告诉我你没有。天哪，那可真可怜。"

Her attitude was rather familiar, though. Shinji had to hide his own smile. "I do. It's just that…"  
她的态度倒是相当熟悉，这让真嗣不得不掩藏自己的微笑。“我知道。只是……”

"Just what?" Asuka gave an impression that her patience was running thin.  
“只是什么？”明日香给人一种耐心即将耗尽的印象。

"Nothing. Forget I said anything."  
“没什么。忘了我说的吧。”

"Thank you so much for picking up my curiosity!"  
"非常感谢你满足我的好奇心！"

"You'll never understand. You don't know what I've been through."  
"你永远不会明白。你不知道我经历了什么。"

Maybe it was the truth.  
也许那是真相。

Or was it? 还是说，并非如此？

"Do you know what _I_ have been through?" Asuka growled.  
"你知道我经历了什么吗？" 明日香咆哮道。

He could guess, though. Her eyes couldn't lie.  
他虽然猜得到，但她的眼神不会说谎。

"Perhaps, perhaps not." He mirrored her response and spoke up again. "Why don't you smile more, with that angelic face of yours?"  
“或许吧，或许不。”他模仿她的回答，再次开口，“你那天使般的面容，为何不多笑笑呢？”

Her expression left no doubt of how she felt about his smugness. "You know, I'd rather not use that particular phrase."  
她的表情清楚地表明了她对他的自满有何感想。“你知道吗，我宁愿不用那个特定的词。”

Shinji gulped. That was his intention. "Does it...mean anything to you?"  
真嗣咽了口唾沫。那正是他的意图。“这……对你有什么意义吗？”

She might have noticed something; instead of answering his question, Asuka came up with one of her own. "Does 'Lilim' mean anything to you?" This time, an inscrutable expression showed up on her face. It was mixed with anticipation and...nervousness? Even dread?  
"她或许察觉到了什么；没有回答他的问题，明日香反而提出了自己的疑问。“‘莉莉姆’这个词对你有什么意义吗？”这次，她的脸上浮现出一种难以捉摸的表情。混合着期待和……紧张？甚至是恐惧？”

"Yes." "是的。"

But those thoughts were shoved aside as dawning realization struck Shinji like a nuclear strike.  
但这些念头被突如其来的领悟所取代，仿佛核打击一般击中了真嗣。

Of who she might actually be.  
关于她可能的真实身份。

"You know, I think we've met before." Asuka smiled. It was hard to detect what was hidden behind that face. "I have a question for you...Third."  
"你知道吗，我觉得我们以前见过。" 明日香微笑着。很难看出那张脸背后隐藏着什么。"我有个问题要问你……第三。"

"Which one are you?" "你是哪一个？"

第 45 章：最终小节**

Third… 第三…

Only _his_ Asuka would call him like that.  
只有他的明日香会这样称呼他。

Well, at least _one_ of his Asukas…  
嗯，至少有一个他的明日香…

Who was she? 她是谁？

If she knew him, and she knew that he was the Third Child…  
如果她认识他，而且她知道他是第三子……

She must've come from one of his loops.  
她一定来自他其中的一个循环。

"Shinji?" He must've been caught in his train of thoughts for too long – Asuka's voice gained a note of worry in it.  
“真嗣？”他一定是陷入了太久的沉思——明日香的声音中带上了一丝担忧。

It was understandable, though. After all, she just threw out the most vital piece of information that said a part of her real identity. If he didn't give any reactions, Asuka might think he wasn't the person she was looking for.  
不过，这是可以理解的。毕竟，她刚刚抛出了关于她真实身份最关键的信息。如果他没有反应，明日香可能会认为他不是她在寻找的那个人。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

A smile immediately bloomed across her face.  
她的脸上立刻绽放出了笑容。

She took a step forward and extended her hand.  
她向前迈了一步，伸出了手。

"Hold my hand," after getting no reactions out of Shinji, Asuka demanded.  
“牵我的手，”在得不到真嗣的反应后，明日香命令道。

Fortunately, he knew how to do that.  
幸运的是，他知道该怎么做。

Her hand was warm and silky, just like he had always remembered.  
她的手温暖而光滑，正如他一直记得的那样。

"I have a question…" “我有个问题……”

"Which one are you?" “你是哪一个？”

Shinji blinked. This would be _his_ question, not _hers_.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。这本该是他的问题，而不是她的。

"I…what kind of question is that?" Shinji let out a short laugh. "You know, actually, I was going to ask you the same thing…"  
“我……这是什么问题？”真嗣发出了一声短促的笑声。“你知道吗，实际上，我正想问你同样的问题……”

He could see a slight frown cross her face. From the reflections in her eyes, Shinji knew he looked just the same.  
他能看到她脸上掠过一丝皱眉。从她眼中的倒影里，真嗣知道自己的表情也如出一辙。

"What's the last thing you remember?" Asked Asuka.  
"你记得的最后一件事是什么？" 明日香问道。

"Killing myself with the Lance, destroying Adam and my EVA in the process," he replied.  
"用长枪自杀，过程中摧毁了亚当和我的 EVA，" 他回答道。

He noticed her eyes turned mad. "Me…too."  
他注意到她的眼神变得疯狂。"我……也是。"

Shinji's eyes widened. 真嗣的眼睛睁大了。

He never remembered seeing her destroy Adam and Unit 02 together.  
他从未记得见过她与零号机一起摧毁亚当。

Was destroying Adam and Lilith the key to end the loops? Or the Lance of Longinus, the slayer of Gods?  
摧毁亚当和莉莉丝是结束循环的关键吗？还是说，是那把弑神之矛——朗基努斯之枪？

What did this mean? 这究竟意味着什么？

A dawning horror of realization struck him.  
一种逐渐明了的恐怖感击中了他。

She wasn't from one of his cycles.  
她不是来自他所在的任何一个循环。

Then where… 那…

He felt her grip on his hand tighten as her other hand joined.  
他感觉到她握住他的手更紧了，另一只手也加入了进来。

"This is…I don't understand." Asuka mumbled.  
“这…我不明白。”明日香喃喃道。

"Neither do I, Asuka." Shinji followed.  
"我也不想，明日香。" 真嗣接着说。

"I…" Asuka sighed. "Damn it, no beating around the bush anymore."  
"我……" 明日香叹了口气。"该死，不再绕弯子了。"

"I've met other you…Shinjis…before."  
"我之前遇到过其他……真嗣们……。"

"What?!" Shinji felt his blood freeze. "How?!" He didn't understand. How did Asuka go on loops as well? Since when? Did one of the Third Impacts involving her make her into her own circles?  
“什么？！” 真嗣感到血液凝固了。“怎么会？！” 他不明白。明日香怎么也会陷入循环？从什么时候开始的？难道是涉及她的第三次冲击让她进入了自身的循环？

Now that he finally understood where the pain and sadness in her eyes came from.  
现在他终于明白她眼中痛苦和悲伤的来源了。

Because of him. 因为他。

Just like for him, it was because of her.  
正如对他一样，那是因为她。

"I don't entirely understand the technical details…but," he saw her let out a sigh again. "The first time…I was on a beach beside the red sea…"  
“我并不完全理解那些技术细节……但是，”他看到她再次叹了口气，“第一次……我是在红海旁的一个海滩上……”

Even shell-shock couldn't properly describe one percent of his feelings as realization hit him like a meteor.  
即便是炮弹休克也无法准确描述他此刻感受的百分之一，当真相如流星般击中他时。

"You…I mean _Shinji,_ choked me. I thought I was dead, but it turned out I didn't. Instead, I was sent into a new world with a fresh start."  
“你…我是说真嗣，掐住了我。我以为我要死了，结果并没有。相反，我被送到了一个全新的世界，有了重新开始的机会。”

And his speculation, as startling, _outrageous_ as it was, wasn't wrong.  
而他的猜测，尽管惊人且离谱，却并非错误。

She was _his_ Asuka. 她是他的明日香。

Where it all started, and where it would likely end.  
一切开始的地方，也很可能是终结之地。

He thought that he had lost her forever, and that she was dead.  
他以为自己永远失去了她，以为她已经死去。

By his own hands. 死于他自己的手。

He didn't know what he felt about this revelation. In fact, he didn't even know what he should've felt.  
他不知道自己对这一发现有何感受。事实上，他甚至不知道自己应该有什么感受。

Though the physical feelings couldn't lie to him – a clear, unmistakable sense of hotness running down his face.  
尽管身体的感觉不会欺骗他——一种清晰、不容置疑的热流正顺着他的脸颊流淌。

Was he crying? 他在哭吗？

He thought he had already wept all of his tears, that he couldn't cry anymore even if he wanted to.  
他以为自己已经流尽了所有的泪水，即使想哭也再无泪可流。

But now though… 但现在……

Shinji suddenly felt an uncontrollable urge to just leap forward and hold her, not breaking away from it until the end of the world.  
真嗣突然感到一种无法抑制的冲动，想要向前一跃紧紧抱住她，直到世界尽头也不松手。

Well, he couldn't see this world would end in the foreseeable future…  
好吧，他看不出这个世界在可预见的未来会结束……

"Are you…the one who-" "你……是那个……"

"Yes," Shinji replied before Asuka could even finish her question. It must've been hard for her to ask, though. How would you ask if someone was the person who killed you, anyway? "I'm sorry, Asuka. I can explain, I didn't mean to do it. I-"  
"是的，" 真嗣在明日香还没问完之前就回答了。对她来说，这肯定很难开口。毕竟，你怎么问一个人是不是那个杀了你的人呢？"对不起，明日香。我可以解释，我不是故意的。我-"

"Shut up," her command went effective instantly. "Gott, I thought you'd stop apologizing so much after so long. Well, it seemed like you're still the idiot I know." Asuka scoffed as she pulled away from him.  
"闭嘴，"她的命令立刻生效。"天哪，我以为这么长时间后你不会再这么频繁道歉了。看来你还是我认识的那个傻瓜。" 明日香嗤之以鼻，从他身边抽身离开。

This time, there was something on her face that changed.  
这一次，她脸上的神情变了。

_Confliction. 冲突。_

"I…" Asuka sighed. "How anticlimactic…"  
"我…" 明日香叹了口气。"真是反高潮啊…"

Shinji could very well understand her, though. He had never thought he would meet _her,_ the Prime Asuka, the girl he had killed by his own hands, the person he loved and hurt the most. She was dead for all he knew.  
但真嗣完全能理解她。他从未想过会遇到她，初代明日香，那个被他亲手杀死、他深爱却又伤害最深的女孩。据他所知，她已经死了。

He had never given a thought of what would their reunion look like since he never thought of it possible.  
他从没想过重逢会是怎样的场景，因为他从未认为这可能发生。

Now though… 但现在……

What was he supposed to say?  
他该说些什么呢？

Even after all of the social skills he had acquired…all of the time he had spent with her, understanding her…  
即便他已习得所有社交技巧……即便他与她共度的时光，深入了解她……

He found himself unable to come up with anything at the moment. He simply didn't know what to do to make it right.  
此刻他却发现自己无计可施。他根本不知道该怎么做才能让一切恢复正常。

Perhaps there was nothing he could do.  
或许他真的无能为力。

"And…how disgusting…" "而且……多么恶心……"

Shinji blinked. 真嗣眨了眨眼。

Why would she call him disgusting, anyway?  
无论如何，她为什么会称他为恶心呢？

Well, he _was_ disgusting, was he not?  
嗯，他很令人厌恶，不是吗？

How could she not think of him as disgusting, after he had killed her?  
在他杀了她之后，她怎么可能不觉得他恶心呢？

How many Asuka got hurt because of _him_?  
有多少个明日香因为他而受伤？

Slowly, Shinji finally lifted his head high enough to make eye contact with the redhead standing in front of him.  
慢慢地，真嗣终于抬起头，足以与站在他面前的红发女孩对视。

Her eyes gleamed discord.  
她的眼中闪烁着不和谐的光芒。

It seemed like she wanted to say something, but forced herself to swallow the words before they could come out.  
她似乎想说些什么，却强行咽下了即将脱口而出的话语。

Turning his head, Shinji saw two adults carrying several large suitcases as they approached them. Asuka must've noticed them as well since she immediately turned her head to the adults with a – Shinji could very well classify it as fake – smile. "Hi Papa! Hi Momma!" Asuka greeted, waving her hand.  
转过头，真嗣看到两个成年人提着几个大行李箱向他们走来。明日香肯定也注意到了他们，因为她立刻转头向着那两位成年人，脸上带着一个——真嗣可以毫不犹豫地称之为虚假的——微笑。“嗨，爸爸！嗨，妈妈！”明日香挥手打招呼。

"Hey, dear," Kyoko greeted back. "Papa and I got our belongings. Took us long enough to find you! Why are you here, anyway? Isn't this departures level?"  
“嘿，亲爱的，”京子回应道，“爸爸和我把行李都拿来了。找你们可真费了不少时间！话说，你在这里做什么？这不是出发层吗？”

"I had to meet someone," Asuka replied, pointing at Shinji.  
“我得见个人，”明日香回答，指了指真嗣。

Asuka's parents set their eyes on Shinji. He had to admit, though, that if not for the life experience and ordeals he had been through that made him tough like Gendo, he probably wouldn't be able to withstand the piercing glare Asuka's parents were shooting at him.  
明日香的父母将目光投向了真嗣。他不得不承认，如果不是因为他经历过的那些生活磨难和考验让他变得像源堂一样坚韧，他可能无法承受明日香父母那锐利的目光。

"Who is he?" Protectiveness radiated from Kyoko's voice.  
“他是谁？”京子的声音中透着保护欲。

"He's the friend I met on the internet," Asuka's reply came out so naturally as if she had been anticipating the question. "You know, the person I was talking about."  
“他是我网上认识的朋友，”明日香的回答如此自然，仿佛她一直在等待这个问题。“就是我之前提到的那个人。”

"Oh," Shinji hastily regained some semblance of composure. "Hello, Mister and Mrs. Soryu!" Of course Asuka would come up with _some_ reasons to come to Japan if she wanted to find him. He was basically doing the same thing, after all. "I am Shinji Ikari, charmed to meet you!"  
"哦，" 真嗣急忙恢复了一些镇定。"您好，索留夫妇！" 当然，如果明日香想找到他，她会想出一些理由来日本的。毕竟，他基本上也在做同样的事情。"我是真嗣，很高兴见到您！"

This time Asuka's parents showed wary smiles at him and greeted him back. Even though he had heard descriptions of her parents from Asuka many times before, he had never met them in person. Moreover, it was understandable that they would be vigilant toward him – he's a teenage boy in their eyes, and they had to protect their daughter from any possible harm, right?  
这次明日香的父母对他露出了谨慎的微笑，并向他回礼。尽管他多次从明日香那里听到她父母的描述，但他从未亲自见过他们。此外，他们对他保持警惕是可以理解的——在他们眼中，他是个青少年男孩，他们必须保护女儿免受任何可能的伤害，对吧？

Asuka turned her head away from her parents and looked at Shinji again, taking the fake expression off her face instantly. "Let's go then, shall we?"  
明日香转过头，不再看她的父母，再次看向真嗣，脸上的假表情瞬间消失。"那我们走吧，好吗？"

XXXXXX

Shinji sat on the couch watching TV as he sulked. He and Asuka had gone on to their separate ways after the brief, yet striking meeting at the airport. She did ask him for his phone number, though. It's just that…for the first time since his first cycle, he didn't know how to approach her again.  
真嗣坐在沙发上，一边看电视一边生闷气。他和明日香在机场那短暂而引人注目的会面后，各自走上了不同的道路。不过，她确实问过他的电话号码。只是……自从他的第一个循环以来，他第一次不知道如何再次接近她。

From the looks of it, Asuka was here to study abroad for a long time, and for some reason her parents had agreed on. He wasn't going to complain, though. It only meant that they would have more time to spend together.  
从目前的情况来看，明日香是来这里长期留学的，不知为何她的父母也同意了。不过，他并不打算抱怨。这意味着他们将有更多的时间在一起。

Only if Asuka would want to spend time with _him_, of course.  
当然，前提是明日香愿意和他共度时光。

He was sure that she would want to spend time with _Shinji._ But from the almost 180 degree turn of attitude after she learned about his real identity, he also knew his hopes were minimal.  
他确信她会想和真嗣共度时光。但从她得知他真实身份后态度几乎 180 度的大转变来看，他也明白自己的希望渺茫。

Perhaps just like she said, she couldn't see all of the Shinjis the same?  
或许正如她所说，她无法将所有的真嗣一视同仁？

His train of thoughts was interrupted by the vibration of his phone. Taking the small device out of his pocket, Shinji unlocked the phone before seeing a new message from Asuka had popped up.  
他的思绪被手机的震动打断。真嗣从口袋里拿出这个小设备，解锁手机后看到一条来自明日香的新消息弹了出来。

_Meet me at the park near the school.  
在学校附近的公园见。_

_-Asuka Langley Soryu -惣流·明日香·兰格雷_

Shinji quickly got up to his feet and changed into a set of somewhat stylish clothes. Making Asuka wait would be beyond cruel, not to mention the ambiguous situation they were in.  
真嗣迅速起身，换上了一套还算时髦的衣服。让明日香等待简直是残忍至极，更不用说他们所处的暧昧情境了。

As Shinji walked to the park, his mind kept running in turmoil. What would she want from him, anyway? Making it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him?  
当真嗣走向公园时，他的思绪一直在混乱中翻腾。她究竟想要从他这里得到什么呢？明确表示她不想与他有任何瓜葛吗？

He had to admit, though, that he understood her even if she did that. Asuka came here in hopes of finding _Shinji,_ not _him._  
不过，他不得不承认，即使她那样做，他也能理解她。明日香来这里是为了找真嗣，而不是他。

The park looked like he had always remembered - just with more people in the background running around and having fun, prosperity and hope shined under the blazing sun.  
公园的景象和他记忆中的一样——只是背景中多了些四处奔跑、尽情玩耍的人们，繁荣与希望在烈日下闪耀。

Asuka's red hair stood out from the mass of people like how Polaris stood out in the dark night sky.  
明日香的红发在人群中格外显眼，就像北极星在漆黑的夜空中那样突出。

"We gotta be quick, I finally got some free time," Asuka said as Shinji approached talking distance.  
“我们得快点，我好不容易才有空闲时间，”明日香说道，此时真嗣走近了说话的距离。

"I have a few questions for you."  
“我有几个问题想问你。”

"I assume you've been through the same thing as me…"  
"我想你和我经历了一样的事情……"

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点点头。

"Do you love me? I mean, do you love Asuka?"  
"你爱我吗？我是说，你爱明日香吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Why? I thought you hated me. You killed me, after all."  
"为什么？我以为你恨我。毕竟，你杀了我。"

"No Asuka! I never hated you! That time…I just came out of Instrumentality…I didn't know what was real. I just…I didn't know what to think about. It was only after you touched my face I knew you were real, but when I realized it…it was already too late."  
“不，明日香！我从没恨过你！那时……我只是刚从人类补完计划中出来……我不知道什么是真实的。我只是……我不知道该怎么想。直到你触碰我的脸，我才知道你是真实的，但当我意识到这一点时……已经太迟了。”

"Is that so?" She tried not to let how she felt about his revelation show. "You know…at first, I really thought you hated me, and I thought I should hate you, too."  
“是吗？”她尽力不让自己的真实感受因他的坦白而显露。“你知道吗……起初，我真的以为你恨我，我也以为我应该恨你。”

_It was like the first time again. Standing on the deck of Over the Rainbow, Asuka tried her best not to let her disgust show.  
仿佛又回到了第一次。站在“彩虹之上”的甲板上，明日香竭尽全力不让自己的厌恶之情流露出来。_

_After all, he had just killed her.  
毕竟，他刚刚杀了她。_

_Was it really disgust, though? Toward him?  
但那真的是厌恶吗？对他？_

_Or was it just deep sadness that he would never be the one she wanted? That he couldn't reciprocate her feelings toward him? That he didn't come to help when she desperately needed him?  
还是说，只是深深的悲伤，因为他永远不会是她想要的那个人？因为他无法回应她对他的感情？因为他没有在她最需要他的时候前来帮助？_

_"I'm Shinji, Shinji Ikari."  
"我是真嗣，碇真嗣。"_

_Asuka's lips twitched, seeing the sheepish expression on his face. Only she knew what was hidden beneath it, and how far he would go.  
看到他脸上尴尬的表情，明日香的嘴唇微微抽动。只有她知道那下面隐藏着什么，以及他会走多远。_

_"Asuka Langley Soryu." She answered coldly.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。" 她冷冷地回答道。_

_To her surprise, she didn't see any disappointment from his face like she expected.  
令她意外的是，她并没有从他的脸上看到预期中的失望。_

_In retrospect, she could very well understand him. Shinji didn't really care about anything at that time, did he? He never showed any interest to other girls at school – except Rei Ayanami, who had an innate ability to attract him.  
回想起来，她完全能理解他。那时真嗣对任何事都不太在意，不是吗？他在学校从未对其他女孩表现出兴趣——除了绫波零，她天生就有吸引他的能力。_

_So, really, why would he care about just another girl who acted coldly at him? If anything, he was happy that she would bother him.  
所以，说真的，他为什么要关心又一个对他冷淡的女孩呢？如果有什么的话，他反而高兴她会来打扰他。_

_What was this emptiness that she felt, when he wasn't smiling at her anymore?  
当他的笑容不再向她绽放时，她感受到的这种空虚是什么？_

"At first, I thought I should focus on how to save the world…all by myself, of course…and tried to ignore everything else, including you."  
“起初，我以为我应该专注于如何独自拯救世界……当然，也试图忽略其他一切，包括你。”

_Asuka knew what she had to do. Defeat the Angels, then defeat SEELE.  
明日香知道她必须做什么。击败使徒，然后击败 SEELE。_

_And her mother…she was in the EVA…  
而她的母亲……她在 EVA 里……_

_The reunion with her mother on board Unit 02 while deep in the seas under Over the Rainbow alone was tearful; with her help, she could defeat Gaghiel all by herself as well, just like how she intended it to go.  
与母亲在二号机内深海重逢，仅此一幕便已泪流满面；在母亲的协助下，她也能独自击败迦吉尔，正如她所期望的那样。_

_Being cold to nearly everyone around her was a rather simple task for her to do; she had always been alone.  
对周围几乎所有人冷淡，对她来说并非难事；她一直孤身一人。_

_Even Kaji couldn't sparkle anything in her anymore; she only needed her mother, right?  
即便是加持也无法再在她心中闪耀；她只需要她的母亲，对吧？_

_Being forced to do the sync training with Shinji to beat Israfel once again wasn't necessarily a bad experience for her – his cooking skills was something she definitely enjoyed, no matter how everything else between was shit at that time.  
被迫与真嗣再次进行同步训练以击败伊斯拉斐尔，对她来说并非全然糟糕的经历——他的烹饪技艺确实让她享受，尽管那段时间其他一切都糟糕透顶。_

_She tried to avoid, and be cold at him as much as possible.  
她尽可能地试图避开他，对他冷淡。_

_Even though it was painful.  
尽管这很痛苦。_

"I thought I could do it all alone…but I failed. My second chance was an absolute disaster with endless loneliness and suffering…even my mother couldn't help me with it. She could talk to me when I was in the EVA, but outside of that? I had nothing left. I pushed everyone away from me."  
“我以为我能独自完成一切……但我失败了。第二次机会简直就是一场灾难，无尽的孤独与痛苦……连母亲也无法帮我。她在 EVA 里还能与我交谈，但除此之外呢？我一无所有。我把所有人都推开了。”

_Did she really not need anyone?  
她真的不需要任何人吗？_

_Asuka thought to herself as she stood on the deck of the Over the Rainbow once again.  
明日香站在“彩虹之上”号的甲板上，心中暗自思忖。_

_Maybe telling Kaji about everything was a good idea…  
或许把一切都告诉加持是个好主意……_

_Just like she had expected, this time the triple-spy tried his best to sabotage Gendo's scenario…by himself.  
正如她所预料的那样，这次三重间谍竭尽全力试图破坏碇司令的计划……靠他自己。_

_Which only got him killed faster.  
这只会让他死得更快。_

_And also herself. 还有她自己。_

_She tried to convince herself that she needed no one, and that she hated Shinji.  
她试图说服自己不需要任何人，而且她恨真嗣。_

_But why did she keep failing worse than the first time, with all of the foreknowledge she had?  
但为什么她拥有所有先知的情况下，每次失败都比第一次更糟糕呢？_

_One boy couldn't make such a dramatic difference, could he?  
一个男孩不可能造成如此戏剧性的变化，对吧？_

"I was so stubborn and refused to believe that I needed you…until that time…"  
“我曾那么固执，拒绝承认我需要你……直到那一次……”

_It was her third attempt. The initial fight with Sandalphon went just like she planned – killing the Angel without getting herself into danger, like how she did it in her second loop. Though it quickly made an unexpected turn as the Angel executed a maneuver she hadn't seen before.  
这是她的第三次尝试。最初与桑达尔丰的战斗正如她所计划的那样进行——在没有让自己陷入危险的情况下杀死了天使，就像她在第二次循环中所做的那样。然而，战斗很快出现了意外转折，天使施展了一招她之前未曾见过的动作。_

_She realized her mistake, that Angels weren't programmed to behave in a certain way. It wasn't just a video game for her.  
她意识到自己的错误，天使并非按照预定程序行动。这不仅仅是一场电子游戏。_

_Just as she started to accept her fate, a familiar sensation hit her.  
就在她开始接受命运之际，一种熟悉的感觉袭来。_

_Another giant hand holding her back and pulling her up from the deadly abyss.  
又一只巨手将她拉回，从那致命的深渊中拽起。_

_"Why did you save me?" Asuka said in deadpan, though the emotions inside her rampaged like a hurricane. "I mean, I treated you like shit. You should be happy that I'm gone from your life."  
“你为什么要救我？”明日香面无表情地说，尽管她内心的情感如飓风般肆虐。“我是说，我对你那么差劲。你应该庆幸我离开你的生活。”_

_"No…Soryu-san," Shinji said, failing to look her into the eyes. "I just…I don't know. But I just can't stand there and watch you die while I could do something about it."  
“不……惣流小姐，”真嗣说，不敢直视她的眼睛。“我只是……我不知道。但我就是不能站在那里，眼睁睁看着你死去，而我本可以做些什么。”_

_Asuka wasn't able to make sense of his actions. Why would he care about her at all? Of course it wasn't because they were both EVA pilots and didn't have loving parents.  
明日香无法理解他的行为。他为何会在意她呢？当然不是因为他们都是 EVA 驾驶员且都没有慈爱的父母。_

_Right? 对吧？_

_She had never seen him go that far for any other person, not even Rei.  
她从未见过他为其他任何人做到那种程度，甚至不包括绫波。_

_Why?_

"Then I thought…maybe working with you would be a good idea. We were both EVA pilots; maybe with our combined strength, we could turn the tide."  
“然后我想……或许与你合作会是个好主意。我们都是 EVA 驾驶员；也许凭借我们联合的力量，能够扭转局势。”

_"I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. It seems like we'll be working together for a while, and I'm not accepting subpar performance. Got it, Third?" Her voice wasn't filled with disgust and anger like before, though it wasn't friendly, either.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。看来我们得合作一段时间了，我可不接受平庸的表现。明白了吗，三号？" 她的语气虽不再像之前那样充满厌恶和愤怒，但也绝非友好。_

_She tried to convince herself she was only doing it for business.  
她试图说服自己这么做纯粹是出于工作需要。_

_"Um, okay? I mean, sure," the sheepish expression on his face said louder than any words about how he actually felt about her remark.  
"呃，好吧？我是说，当然，" 他脸上尴尬的表情比任何言语都更响亮地表达了他对她那番话的真实感受。_

_In the following months, she had to work with him, mainly during EVA combat training. She knew that in order to defeat the MP EVAs, they had to be the best of the best in EVA piloting.  
在接下来的几个月里，她不得不与他一起工作，主要是在 EVA 战斗训练期间。她知道，为了击败 MP EVA，他们必须成为 EVA 驾驶中的佼佼者。_

_As they spent more time together, Asuka couldn't help but feel a sense of Déjà vu of her first cycle – she was actually_ _**enjoying**_ _their time together._  
随着他们相处的时间增多，明日香不禁感到一种似曾相识的感觉，仿佛回到了她的第一个周期——她实际上很享受与他们在一起的时光。

_The way he cooked for her, taking care of her, and smiling at her…  
他为她烹饪的方式，照顾她，对她微笑的样子……_

_Were those she had always been missing?  
那些她一直思念的，就是这些吗？_

_Not even her mother could provide those feelings…  
即便是她的母亲也无法给予这些感受……_

_But she should hate him, right? She couldn't allow herself to fall for him.  
但她应该恨他，对吧？她不能让自己爱上他。_

"Even though I tried to tell myself that I shouldn't be nice to you, I couldn't." _Not with that smile on your face._  
“即使我试图告诉自己不应该对你好，我也做不到。”你的微笑让我无法抗拒。

_"What did you say?!" "你说什么？！"_

_"I…um…sort of like you? I mean, I like spending some time with you…"  
"我…呃…有点喜欢你？我是说，我喜欢和你一起度过的时光…"_

_How could she believe that, anyway? Confessions, she had heard a lot of them, multiplied by the number of loops she had been through. She never cared about them, though, since she knew they meant nothing.  
她怎么可能相信这种话呢？告白，她听过太多了，乘以她经历过的循环次数。尽管如此，她从未在意过，因为她知道那些话毫无意义。_

_But why did Shinji's confession affect her so much?  
但为什么真嗣的告白对她影响如此之大？_

_Coming from a person who should hate her…  
来自一个本应恨她的人……_

_Or was she wrong from the very beginning?  
还是说，从一开始她就错了？_

_He should hate her, shouldn't he?  
他应该恨她的，不是吗？_

_The why... 那么为什么..._

"It was only then that I start to realize…that I was the one at fault."  
“直到那时我才开始意识到…错的人其实是我。”

"If I could treat you nicely…"  
"如果我能好好对待你……"

"Only because I was a total bitch to you…"  
"只因我曾对你太过刻薄……"

Seeing that she was about to have a breakdown, Shinji quickly stepped forward and pulled her close.  
看到她快要崩溃的样子，真嗣迅速上前，将她紧紧拥入怀中。

At first, he could sense some struggle from her, but instead of letting go, he held on closer.  
起初，他能感觉到她有些挣扎，但他没有放手，反而更紧地抱住了她。

It was one thing he knew that he had to do.  
这是他知道自己必须做的一件事。

_Even with all of her pride and stubbornness on the defense, Asuka had no choice but to admit to herself that she was falling for him. Quickly.  
尽管她的骄傲和固执都在防御，但明日香不得不承认，她正迅速地爱上他。_

_Why did it have to be him, of all people?  
为什么偏偏是他，所有人中的他？_

_Sense of guilt? 内疚感？_

_She owed him that, didn't she?  
她欠他这个，不是吗？_

_Of course it wasn't about anything else…she really tried to convince herself.  
当然，这并不是关于其他任何事情……她真的试图说服自己。_

"That one time…when you said you love me…I finally knew what I've always been seeking for."  
“那一次……当你说你爱我的时候……我终于明白了我一直在寻找的是什么。”

"And what I nearly missed out on."  
“以及我差点错过的东西。”

"Thank you, Shinji." "谢谢你，真嗣。"

The boy found himself at a loss for words.  
男孩发现自己无言以对。

Did she just admit that…  
她刚刚是承认了……

"Asuka," Shinji pulled away from her by a slight amount. "Please tell me this is real."  
"Asuka," 真嗣微微从她身边退开。"请告诉我这是真的。"

What if this was yet another dream created by his mother?  
万一这又是他母亲创造的另一个梦境呢？

"I'm as real as you can ever get, idiot," Asuka made a grin. "In fact, I'm worried about it as well…is this real? I don't want to have anything to do with EVAs ever again. I'm really getting tired of all that shit."  
"我真实得不能再真实了，傻瓜，" 明日香咧嘴一笑。"事实上，我也担心这一点……这是真的吗？我再也不想和 EVA 扯上任何关系了。我真的受够了那些破事。"

"Me too, but…" “我也是，但是……”

Asuka shut him off with a finger pressed on his lips. "Listen to me…we can share our stories with each other, right? My stories with other Shinjis that you shouldn't know about, and your stories with…other Asukas that I shouldn't know about."  
明日香用手指按住他的嘴唇，打断了他。“听我说……我们可以互相分享彼此的故事，对吧？我和其他真嗣的故事，你不应该知道的那些，还有你和其他明日香的故事，我不应该知道的那些。”

Shinji had to admit that it was indeed a brilliant idea. "Asuka, speaking of which…" His eyes turned sad. "I've met a lot of Asuka before… don't you mind it?"  
真嗣不得不承认，这确实是个绝妙的主意。“明日香，说到这个……”他的眼神变得悲伤。“我遇到过很多个明日香……你介意吗？”

It was hard to let go...  
放手很难...

No, it was _impossible_ to let go. For both of them.  
不，放手是不可能的。对他们俩来说都是。

"Saying no would be a lie," Asuka sighed. "But it can't be helped. I mean, I've met other Shinji before as well, so I guess it's fair." Suddenly she narrowed her eyes at him with a small glare, "unless...is there anyone else other than me? Say, the Angel boy?" Her tone was largely playful, though Shinji could still recognize a subtle hint of...worry?  
“说‘不’是谎言，”明日香叹息道，“但这也是没办法的事。我是说，我也遇到过其他版本的真嗣，所以我想这很公平。”突然，她眯起眼睛，带着一丝责备地看着他，“除非...除了我之外，还有别人吗？比如说，那个天使少年？”她的语气多半是开玩笑的，但真嗣仍能察觉到一丝...担忧？

"No, of course not," Shinji replied.  
"不，当然不会，" 真嗣回答道。

"Good. I guess it's really fair, then." Asuka grinned. "Don't get me wrong, but that Angle really tried to take you away from me." She made a huff.  
"很好。那我想这真的很公平。" 明日香咧嘴一笑。"别误会，但那个天使真的想把你从我身边夺走。" 她哼了一声。

"But...even if it's only you...I can't just...forget about them," Shinji didn't even try to hide the pain that appeared briefly on his face.  
"但是...即使只有你...我也不能就这样...忘记他们，" 真嗣甚至没有试图隐藏他脸上短暂出现的痛苦。

"Do you think it's any easier for me?!" Asuka snapped, sadness flashed in her eyes.  
"你以为这对我就容易吗？！" 明日香厉声道，眼中闪过一丝悲伤。

_How many times had she had him taken away from her? By Gendo, by SEELE...  
她有多少次眼睁睁看着他被人夺走？被碇源堂，被 SEELE……_

_She tried her best to keep him away from the harm...at the cost of her own safety.  
她竭尽全力将他隔绝于危险之外……不惜以自己的安全为代价。_

_She couldn't remember how many times...when she was so lonely and in pain...she had thrown herself at him in hopes of finding solace and comfort...but being the shy and reserved boy he was, she could never get what she wanted in this way.  
她记不清有多少次...当她如此孤独和痛苦时...她曾向他扑去，希望能找到慰藉和安慰...但作为一个害羞而内向的男孩，她从未能以这种方式得到她想要的。_

_At the end of the day, the only thing she could do was wipe out the tears, sort herself out, and continue on to the endless and painful journey.  
到了一天的尽头，她唯一能做的就是擦干眼泪，整理好自己，继续那无尽而痛苦的旅程。_

_With him as the only beam of light.  
他是唯一的光芒。_

"But, now that we have each other..."  
"但，既然我们现在有了彼此..."

Shinji never thought he could move on from all of the Asukas he met before.  
真嗣从未想过他能从之前遇到的那些明日香中走出来。

Now though…with _this_ Asuka, who had the same experience as him, the thoughts, the _pain -_ they could be at least mediated.  
然而现在…有了这个和他有着相同经历的明日香，那些思绪，那些痛苦——至少可以得到些许缓解。

A burden for both of them to endure together.  
对他们两人来说，这是一起承受的重担。

The scars would heal...the nightmares would vanish...with each other's presence.  
伤痕会愈合...噩梦会消失...只要有彼此的陪伴。

"Still…why would you stick with me?" Shinji asked. "I mean, you _did_ hate me for a while. You should go for other-"  
“尽管如此…你为什么要坚持和我在一起？”真嗣问道。“我是说，你曾经一度讨厌我。你应该去找别人-”

He was again shut up by her, this time more forcefully. "You are really an idiot, aren't you?" Asuka chuckled. "This might sound stupid, but…"  
他又被她堵了回去，这次更加坚决。“你真是个傻瓜，不是吗？”明日香轻笑道，“这话可能听起来很蠢，但是……”

"After what I've been through, what _we_ have been through…"  
“经历了那么多，我们共同经历的那些……”

"I don't think I can even imagine being with anyone else but you anymore."  
“我想我再也无法想象和别人在一起了，除了你。”

"Asuka, what are you talking about?" Shinji's eyes widened.  
"Asuka，你在说什么？" 真嗣的眼睛睁大了。

"I'm saying that I…" Asuka stopped herself from saying 'love.' Indeed, she loved _Shinji,_ but for now, it was not her place to tell _him_. "I need you…absolutely, idiot."  
"我是说，我…" Asuka 及时止住了即将脱口而出的'爱'。确实，她爱着真嗣，但此刻，她觉得还不是告诉他的时机。"我需要你…绝对，笨蛋。"

He didn't even make the slightest attempt to hide the joy and relief that washed over his face. "Does this mean that I'm forgiven?" He smiled; the immense amount of hope radiated from his voice.  
他甚至没有试图掩饰脸上涌起的喜悦和释然。"这是不是意味着我被原谅了？" 他微笑着；声音中充满了巨大的希望。

"No."

Shinji's face fell in an eyeblink. Of course he didn't deserve her forgiveness. How do you forgive someone who killed you, after all? He bet if not for the other Shinjis that showed her love, Asuka would never want anything to do with him-  
真嗣的脸色在转瞬间黯淡下来。当然，他不配得到她的原谅。毕竟，你怎么能原谅一个杀死你的人呢？他敢打赌，如果不是因为其他真嗣向她展现了爱意，明日香绝不会想和他有任何瓜葛——

"Only after you've spent your lifetime with me…then I'll decide," Asuka slowly let the words out, her voice mixed with expectance and lethal threat.  
“只有在你与我共度一生之后……我才会决定，”明日香缓缓吐出这些话，她的声音混杂着期待与致命的威胁。

Shinji found himself at a loss for words. He did the only thing that came to his mind – reaching out for her hand and grabbing them with his, pulling her closer so that their foreheads touched each other's, their eyes locked.  
真嗣发现自己无言以对。他做了唯一想到的事——伸出手抓住她的手，将她拉近，让他们的额头相触，目光紧紧锁定对方。

"I promise." "我保证。"

"You better." Asuka smiled before suddenly extracting her hands from his grasp and wrapping them tightly around his waist.  
"你最好如此。" 明日香微笑着，突然从他的手中抽回双手，紧紧地环抱住他的腰。

He wasn't going to pull back, though. It would be adamant to a murder crime.  
不过，他并没有退缩。那将是对谋杀罪的坚决否认。

Completely ignoring the whispers and giggles coming from the people around them, Shinji and Asuka continued to hold each other in a tight embrace. At the moment – no, it had always been - all that mattered in the world to them was the one in their lives.  
完全无视周围人们的窃窃私语和轻笑，真嗣和明日香紧紧相拥。此刻——不，一直以来——对他们来说，世界上最重要的就是彼此的存在。

Now, a few words. This had been a long road - at least for me, who's an immature writer and a non-native English speaker. Therefore, I really, really appreciate everyone who reviewed, faved, or followed. Your recognition is my best source of motivation.  
现在，说几句。这是一段漫长的旅程——至少对我这个不成熟的写手和非英语母语者来说。因此，我非常非常感激每一位评论、收藏或关注的人。你们的认可是我最大的动力来源。

And believe me, the emotions and feelings for people who read this fic as I upload will never be the same as people who binge read - I guess the reason is obvious.  
相信我，随着我更新而阅读这篇同人文的读者所感受到的情感和情绪，与那些一口气读完的读者是截然不同的——我想原因显而易见。

Also, this ending isn't really the ending I've originally planned - while that ending is also a good ending, it won't be as good as this one. Sadly you'll never know what that is.  
此外，这个结局并非我最初计划的那个——虽然那个结局也不错，但不及这个好。遗憾的是，你们永远无法知晓那个结局是什么了。

See you later, I guess...  
回头见，我想...

## *Chapter 46*: Chapter 46: After  
*第 46 章*: 第 46 章：之后

**The One In Your Life: After  
生命中的那个：之后**

Asuka tapped her feet impatiently as she waited outside of the room where Shinji was being held in. The hallway was cold and filled with the uncomfortable smell of disinfectant, and the fact that this place was associated with bad memories didn't help things.  
明日香不耐烦地用脚尖敲打着地面，站在关押着真嗣的房间外等待。走廊里冷冰冰的，弥漫着消毒水的刺鼻气味，而这个地方与糟糕的回忆紧密相连，更是让情况雪上加霜。

"Will he be okay, Misato?" Asked Asuka to the woman standing beside her who had just come out of the ward.  
"他会没事吗，美里？" 明日香向站在她身边刚从病房出来的女人问道。

"We can't say for sure," her answer came in a voice that was filled with sadness. "He's alive and all, but…he doesn't seem to be the Shinji we know anymore."  
"我们无法确定，"她的回答带着满满的悲伤。"他还活着，但是……他似乎不再是那个我们所认识的真嗣了。"

"What do you mean?!" Asuka cried. "Tell me he's okay, damn it!"  
"你什么意思？！" 明日香喊道，"告诉我他没事，该死的！"

"Physically he's okay, save for some minor bruises," Misato rubbed her forehead. Even though she had absolutely no idea how he survived it – nor did she understand how Asuka survived – she was still happy that her two foster children came out _mostly_ unharmed. "But…he doesn't seem to know who I am-"  
"身体上他没事，除了一些轻微的擦伤，"美里揉了揉额头。尽管她完全不知道他是如何幸存下来的——也不明白明日香是如何幸存的——但她仍然为她的两个养子基本上安然无恙而感到高兴。"但是……他似乎不认识我了——"

"My WHAT?!" A familiar voice from the inside of the ward cut her off. Asuka heard it and immediately recognized Shinji's voice, she couldn't help but let a nervous expression show up on her face. "I have a girl…girl…"  
"我的什么？！"病房内传来一个熟悉的声音打断了她。明日香听到后立刻认出了是真嗣的声音，她不禁脸上露出了紧张的表情。"我有个女孩…女孩…"

**"GIRLFRIEND?!" "女朋友？！"**

Even when he learned that his father died protecting him didn't have such an impact on him...  
即使得知父亲是为了保护他而死，对他的冲击也没有这么大...

"…You heard him." Misato sighed. "He seems to have some kind of memory loss…"  
“…你听到了。”美里叹了口气。“他似乎失去了某种记忆…”

All of her later words became blurred as Asuka's mind went blank.  
随着明日香思绪一片空白，她后来所说的话都变得模糊不清。

She thought she was about to die when the DSS Choker exploded, but then…it was her mother! She was in the EVA all the time, later Asuka learned that the EVA absorbed her into its core and saved her from the deadly explosion.  
当 DSS 项圈爆炸时，她以为自己要死了，但随后…那是她的母亲！她一直都在 EVA 里，后来明日香得知 EVA 将她吸收进核心，使她免于致命的爆炸。

When she was conscious again, she found herself sitting in a cold and dark entry plug…uninfected.  
当她再次恢复意识时，发现自己正坐在一个冰冷而黑暗的插入栓内……未被感染。

The reunion was tearful - she learned that her mother loved her - and Asuka really wanted to talk to her mother for longer, but there was someone else...that was much more urgent.  
重逢时泪水盈眶——她得知母亲深爱着她——而明日香真的很想与母亲多聊一会儿，但还有一个人……更为迫切。

The retrieval team was already fast enough – but no quicker than her.  
回收小组已经足够迅速——但没有人比她更快。

Asuka knew very well what Shinji would do if she was to die.  
明日香非常清楚，如果她死了，真嗣会怎么做。

_The very first thing she saw after she climbed out of the entry plug was Unit 02, struggling to the edge of the ruined city and self-destructing. Later from Maya, she learned that somehow the EVA transferred the Angelic influence to itself before self-destructing, eliminating both existences at once.  
她从插入栓爬出来后看到的第一件事物，就是 2 号机挣扎着来到废墟城市的边缘，然后自爆。后来从摩耶那里得知，不知为何，EVA 在自爆前将使徒的影响转移到了自己身上，同时消除了两者的存在。_

_Her mother had sacrificed herself to save her...  
她的母亲为了救她而牺牲了自己..._

_It was painful, but somehow it didn't hurt as much as when she broke up with him.  
虽然痛苦，但不知为何，这并不像她与他分手时那般痛彻心扉。_

_But did it really matter?  
但这一切真的重要吗？_

_She had to make sure that he didn't do anything stupid during the time she was unconscious.  
她必须确保在他昏迷期间，他不会做出什么愚蠢的事情。_

_When she finally found the purple EVA, the first thing she saw was the mangled smoking wreck that was once Unit 01.  
当她终于找到那架紫色 EVA 时，首先映入眼帘的是那曾经是 01 号机、如今已扭曲冒烟的残骸。_

_Tears immediately poured out from her eyes – the fact that her left eye was now working only came to her as an afterthought.  
泪水立刻从她的眼中涌出——她左眼现在能看见的事实，对她来说只是事后才想到的细节。_

_He really did it, didn't he? He killed himself because he thought she was dead.  
他真的这么做了，不是吗？他以为她死了，所以选择了自杀。_

_He actually chose her – well, not exactly her, but definitely Asuka – over this saved world.  
他真的选择了她——好吧，不是完全的她，但肯定是选择了明日香——而不是这个被拯救的世界。_

_But now that she was left alone…  
但如今她独自一人……_

…_Think about it this way…even if you found that reason someday…at that point, you'd have already lost everything, and there's nothing you can do besides regretting it…_  
……这么想吧……即便有一天你找到了那个理由……到那时，你已经失去了一切，除了后悔，你别无他法……

_Only after she actually lost him…  
只有在她真正失去他之后……_

_"I'm such an idiot," Asuka mumbled to herself. "Stupid, stupid! STUPID!" Now it was a scream. She soon found herself knelt down to the ground, face covered in tears as she apologized for everything.  
“我真是个白痴，”明日香喃喃自语，“笨蛋，笨蛋！大笨蛋！”现在变成了尖叫。她很快发现自己跪倒在地，泪流满面地为一切道歉。_

_But he wouldn't be here to listen to them anymore…  
但他再也不会在这里听她说了……_

_After losing her mother, Asuka thought she would never love anyone else.  
在失去母亲后，明日香以为自己再也不会爱上任何人了。_

_One person proved her wrong.  
有一个人证明她错了。_

_And then she lost him as well.  
然后她也失去了他。_

_If love is so painful...  
如果爱是如此痛苦..._

_Somehow, Asuka knew that she was going to be alone for the rest of her life.  
不知为何，明日香知道她将孤独终老。_

_She deserved it, didn't she? It was all her fault. Her childish behaviors, her stupid pride and stubbornness.  
这是她应得的，不是吗？一切都是她的错。她的幼稚行为，她的愚蠢自尊和固执。_

_And now it was all paying her back.  
而现在，这一切都在向她讨债。_

_She was so immersed in her own guilt and grief to the extent that even the retrieval team couldn't get any reaction from her.  
她深陷于自己的罪恶感和悲痛之中，以至于回收小组甚至无法从她那里得到任何反应。_

When Asuka learned that Shinji was still alive when the retrieval team found him, she lost all of her self-control and acted like an impoverished miser who had just won the grand prize of the lottery.  
当明日香得知回收小组发现真嗣还活着时，她失去了所有的自制力，表现得就像一个刚刚中了彩票大奖的穷困吝啬鬼。

And now…he just had to lose his memory…  
而现在…他偏偏失去了记忆…

Asuka cried again for the third time of the day.  
明日香今天第三次哭泣了。

Feeling her heart trembling, Misato pulled the fragile girl into a loose embrace. She didn't resist; perhaps she was simply too worn out to do anything.  
"感受到自己内心的颤抖，美里将这个脆弱的女孩轻轻拥入怀中。她没有抗拒；也许她已经疲惫到无力做任何事了。

During the battle, especially the end part of it, the Major of NERV was confused by Asuka's words and actions – not on a linguistic level, but she simply couldn't understand why she said what she said.  
在战斗中，尤其是最后阶段，NERV 的司令官被明日香的话语和行为弄得一头雾水——并非语言层面，而是她完全不明白她为何要说那些话。

Why would they break up? They were practically glued together before. Did Shinji do something terrible to make her angry? But Asuka forgave him in the end, right?  
他们怎么会分手呢？之前他们几乎形影不离。难道真嗣做了什么过分的事惹她生气了？但明日香最后还是原谅了他，对吧？

Now though, seeing how broken the girl was, Misato knew that Asuka still loved him. If the situation wasn't so grim, the thought alone would bring a smile to her face.  
然而现在，看到女孩如此崩溃的样子，美里明白明日香依然爱着他。如果不是情况如此严峻，光是这个念头就足以让她露出微笑。

And…what did Asuka mean when she said 'the next Asuka'? Misato sighed. Maybe she was just saying it metaphorically; she didn't really care, especially not under Asuka's current condition.  
而……明日香说的‘下一个明日香’是什么意思？美里叹了口气。也许她只是用了一个比喻；她其实并不在意，尤其是在明日香目前的状态下。

"Asuka, I know it's hard to accept but-"  
"明日香，我知道这很难接受，但是——"

"No you don't!" Asuka snapped, raising her tear-stained face to look at Misato. "You don't even know one percent of what happened between us! You never cared!"  
"不，你不知道！"明日香厉声反驳，泪痕斑斑的脸庞转向美里。"你连我们之间发生的事情的百分之一都不了解！你从未关心过！"

Even though Asuka's words hurt, they told the truth. Misato's eyelids fell. Ever after Kaji's death, she had been paying practically zero attention to the kids.  
尽管明日香的话刺痛了心，但她说的是事实。美里眼睑低垂。自从加持死后，她几乎没怎么关注过孩子们。

Suddenly the door of the ward slid open, revealing a white hospital gown wearing Shinji standing extremely nervously in the doorway - being woken up in a completely wrecked entry plug without any clue of what it was and how he got there certainly wouldn't help things.  
突然，病房门滑开了，穿着白色病号服的 Shinji 站在门口，显得极度紧张——在一个完全毁坏的插入栓里醒来，没有任何线索知道这是什么以及他是如何到达那里的，这无疑让情况雪上加霜。

Almost immediately, Asuka noticed something different on his face.  
几乎立刻，明日香注意到了他脸上的不同之处。

It was really subtle, but Asuka was just too good at reading him – the coldness, the ice was gone, replaced by shyness and modesty. The loneliness in his cobalt eyes was still there, but the tenderness – when he was looking at her – and the pain – when he wasn't looking at her – were nowhere to been seen.  
这变化非常微妙，但明日香太擅长读懂他了——那股冷酷，那层冰霜已不复存在，取而代之的是羞涩与谦逊。他那钴蓝色的眼眸中依然藏着孤独，但那份温柔——当他注视着她时——以及那份痛楚——当他不注视她时——却已无迹可寻。

She immediately realized the situation.  
她立刻意识到了情况。

The Shinji she knew…he's really gone.  
她所认识的真嗣……他真的消失了。

"Um…" Shinji started first, a visible blush on his face. "Soryu-san?"  
"呃…" 真嗣先开口了，脸上明显泛起红晕。"惣流同学？"

"Call me Asuka, you idiot," the redhead sighed, leaning on the wall as a support to prevent herself from falling down, and closed her eyes to hold back another wave of tears.  
"叫我明日香，你这个笨蛋，" 红发女孩叹了口气，靠在墙上以防自己倒下，闭上眼睛强忍住又一波的泪水。

What was she supposed to do now? This Shinji didn't even know who she was, let alone love her like she wanted.  
她现在该怎么办？这个真嗣甚至不知道她是谁，更别提像她希望的那样爱她了。

But as long as they were alive, the chance was still there, right?  
但只要他们还活着，机会就依然存在，对吧？

"Let's go home first, okay?" Misato interjected, not noticing the new message from a phone number she'd never thought she would hear from ever again.  
"我们先回家吧，好吗？" 美里插话道，没有注意到一个她以为再也不会听到的电话号码发来的新消息。

"H-home?" Asked Shinji nervously.  
"回-回家？" 真嗣紧张地问道。

"Yeah," Misato smiled. "Our new home."  
"嗯，" 美里微笑着。"我们的新家。"

"…Listen Katsuragi, I can explain-"  
"…听着，葛城，我可以解释——"

_SLAP_

The smack on his face was so hard that even the well-trained triple spy couldn't withstand the strike.  
那一巴掌打得如此之重，就连训练有素的三重间谍也难以承受这一击。

"You fucking moron! How dare you do that to me?!" Misato screamed, instinctively reaching out to her pistol that was not there anymore, just to remember that she wasn't military personnel anymore. "You got me worried sick! I thought you…you were…"  
"你这个该死的白痴！你怎么敢那样对我？！" 美里尖叫着，本能地伸手去拿已经不在那里的手枪，这才想起自己已不再是军人。"你让我担心得要命！我以为你……你……"

She didn't need to say it out loud for Kaji to understand. "I know, Katsuragi. I'm sorry." He rubbed his chin, looking tenderly at the lavender-haired woman before him. "But it's what I had to do."  
她无需大声说出来，加持也能明白。"我知道，葛城。对不起。" 他揉着下巴，温柔地看着眼前这位紫发女子。"但这是我必须做的。"

"You know there's another thing you _have to do_ right now, don't you?" Misato scowled at him, piercing the unshaven man with a death glare. "Just a reminder, you promised to me in the recording."  
"你知道你现在还有另一件事要做，对吧？" 美里瞪着他，用死亡凝视穿透这个胡子拉碴的男人。"提醒一下，你在录音里答应过我的。"

Kaji's face turned from slightly confused to a warm smile instantly. "I know. How could I forget?" He chuckled. "Katsuragi, I-"  
加持的脸从微微困惑瞬间转为温暖的笑容。“我知道。我怎么会忘记呢？”他轻笑道，“葛城，我——”

"I love you." “我爱你。”

Killing those twelve bastards by himself was certainly selfish…but he thought he deserved it.  
独自干掉那十二个混蛋确实很自私……但他觉得自己值得这么做。

Now that he finally found his own redemption, moving on with the person he loved was no problem to him anymore.  
如今他终于找到了自己的救赎，与心爱的人继续前行对他来说已不再是难题。

"Ryoji, I love you too."  
“梨斗，我也爱你。”

"Rei, I've already filled out all official documents," Maya looked over to the blue-haired girl standing quietly in the hallway outside of the office with a warm smile. "From now on, I will officially be your foster mother."  
“零，我已经填写完所有官方文件了，”真矢微笑着看向站在办公室外走廊上静静的蓝发女孩，“从今往后，我将正式成为你的养母。”

A slight smile crossed Rei's normally-expression-absent face. "Thank you, Ibuki-san."  
一丝微笑掠过绫波平日里表情空白的脸庞。“谢谢你，伊吹小姐。”

"Nah, Maya is okay," the former technician of NERV waved her hand. "Now, Rei, I noticed that you don't really have clothes other than your school uniform..."  
“没事，真嗣没问题，”NERV 前技术员伊吹摩耶挥了挥手。“对了，绫波，我发现你除了校服之外好像没有其他衣服……”

"I deem them unnecessary, and the wardrobe in my Geofront living quarters is not spacious," Rei replied matter-of-factly.  
“我认为它们并不必要，而且我在 Geofront 住处的衣柜也不大，”绫波平静地回答。

Maya chuckled. "You'll be living with me from now on. So don't worry about it." She raised a finger. "Let's go and get you some new clothes!"  
玛雅轻声笑道：“从今往后你就和我一起住了，别担心。”她竖起一根手指，“走吧，我们去给你买些新衣服！”

"I accept your suggestion."  
“我接受你的建议。”

With that, the young former First Child headed off, following behind Maya closely as they walked toward the exit of the Police Department of the small city that's New Tokyo-4.  
说完，这位年轻的原初号机驾驶员便紧随玛雅身后，朝着新东京-4 市警察局的出口走去。

_"…the key members of the Human Instrumentality Committee were found dead…"  
…人类补完委员会的关键成员被发现死亡…_

Asuka paid no mind to the ramblings on the TV as she couldn't even sort out her own thoughts first. They successfully brought Shinji home - a small villa on the outskirts of the city that miraculously survived the N2 blast - with a considerable amount of effort. After all, nearly everything around him was new to him.  
明日香对电视上的喋喋不休毫不在意，因为她连自己的思绪都还没理清。他们费了很大劲才把真嗣带回家——城市郊区一座奇迹般在 N2 爆炸中幸存的小别墅。毕竟，他周围几乎一切都对他来说是全新的。

Their old apartment was in bad shape - it didn't crumble, but definitely unsafe to live in for a prolonged period.  
他们以前的公寓状况很糟糕——虽然没有倒塌，但长期居住显然不安全。

Misato, for reasons unbeknownst to her, rushed out of the house like a maniac. Asuka couldn't care less, though. Shinji was constantly on her mind.  
不知为何，美里像疯了似的冲出家门。但明日香对此毫不在意，她的心思全在真嗣身上。

_"…the UN is establishing a special court to put people who had connections with the Human Instrumentality Project on trials…"  
“…联合国正在设立一个特别法庭，对与人类补完计划有关联的人进行审判…”_

What if Shinji would never love her ever again? Asuka thought. Even for Shinji who loved her, at that time, they had the bond of EVA. They were both pilots, and that must've brought them closer.  
如果真嗣再也不会爱她了怎么办？明日香思索着。即便是当时爱着她的真嗣，他们之间也有着 EVA 的纽带。他们都是驾驶员，这必定让他们更加亲近。

Now though, they could be said as normal teenagers at best, ex-child soldiers at worst. The bond that brought them closer was lost - Asuka didn't know what exactly caused the former Shinji to love her so much, but she was sure that she couldn't find it out for now.  
如今，他们最多只能算是普通青少年，最坏也不过是曾经的童子军。将他们紧密联系在一起的纽带已经消失——明日香不知道究竟是什么让以前的真嗣如此深爱她，但她确信目前自己无法找到答案。

Asuka thought about using her looks to make Shinji like her, just like how every other boy in school would. But would such a relationship last long? Asuka loved him, of course, but what if she made Shinij only like her outside, but not the person she was?  
明日香考虑过利用自己的外貌来让真嗣喜欢她，就像学校里其他男孩一样。但这样的关系能持久吗？明日香当然爱他，但如果她只是让真嗣喜欢她的外表，而不是她这个人本身呢？

It would be unacceptable.  
这是不可接受的。

Was she supposed to move on with her life?  
她应该继续她的生活吗？

_"…the saviors of the world, the pilots of the Evangelions saved us…"  
“…世界的救星，Evangelion 的驾驶员们拯救了我们…”_

A sad smile crossed her face. What was she supposed to do in the future?  
一丝苦笑掠过她的脸庞。她未来该怎么办呢？

She couldn't pilot the EVA even if she wanted to - every single one of the EVAs was completely demolished. Unit 00, 01, 02, 03, and 04, the MP EVA series…Lilith and Adam were gone, no one could build new EVAs without them.  
即使她想驾驶 EVA 也无能为力——所有的 EVA 都被彻底摧毁了。零号机、初号机、二号机、三号机、四号机，MP EVA 系列…莉莉丝和亚当都不复存在，没有它们，无人能制造新的 EVA。

Not that she wanted to pilot them anymore in the first place.  
并非她一开始就还想驾驶它们。

_"…NERV will be disbanded and transform into a new research organization focused on clean energy and metaphysical biology…"  
“……NERV 将被解散，并转型为一个专注于清洁能源和超自然生物学的新研究组织……”_

She could get a job in the new NERV, though. Asuka had Masters degrees in physics and math, getting a career was nothing to her. She could still continue her way up to Doctorate and start her own research program as well.  
不过，她可以在新的 NERV 中找到工作。明日香拥有物理学和数学的硕士学位，对她来说，获得一份职业并非难事。她仍可以继续攻读博士学位，并开始自己的研究项目。

But was she going to go there all by herself?  
但她真的要独自一人去那里吗？

She tried to be independent before.  
她曾试图保持独立。

She thought she could be alone.  
她以为自己可以独自一人。

And they all turned out to be complete disasters.  
结果全都变成了彻头彻尾的灾难。

Asuka knew that she should really, really put her pride down.  
明日香知道她真的、真的应该放下她的骄傲。

She might be extremely stubborn, but she wasn't idiotic.  
她可能非常固执，但她并不愚蠢。

"Stupid Shinji. I wonder what's taking him so long to make dinner," Asuka huffed and got up from the couch. Making Shinji cook for her was a rather easy task to do, one polite request was all it took for the modest boy to fulfill her wish. Asuka tried not to think about his real reason behind it - was he only doing it because he's a doormat? Or since now he learned that Asuka was supposed to be his girlfriend, Shinji thought he should at least do _something,_ even though in his memories he didn't even know her?  
"笨蛋真嗣。不知道他做饭怎么这么慢，" 明日香嘟囔着从沙发上站起来。让真嗣为她做饭是一件相当简单的事，只需一个礼貌的请求，这个谦逊的男孩就会满足她的愿望。明日香尽量不去想他背后的真正原因——他这么做只是因为他是个软柿子吗？还是因为他现在知道明日香应该是他的女朋友，真嗣认为至少应该做些什么，尽管在他的记忆中他甚至不认识她？

Walking into the kitchen area, she was greeted by the familiar scene of Shinji cooking something for her as Asuka relished in the delicious aroma of food.  
走进厨房区域，她被熟悉的场景迎接：真嗣正在为她烹饪什么，明日香陶醉在食物诱人的香气中。

Shinji must've noticed her presence as he turned around from the stove to look at her with a slightly nervous expression. "Asuka?" He paused for a moment before speaking up again. "The dinner will be ready in 10 minutes."  
真嗣一定注意到了她的存在，他从炉子前转过身来，带着些许紧张的表情看着她。"明日香？" 他停顿了一下，然后再次开口，"晚餐再过 10 分钟就好了。"

Under normal circumstances - when she and Shinji were in a relationship - she probably would've acted fake angry and scold him. It would be nothing but playful and, if she guessed correctly, Shinji actually liked it when she acted in that way.  
在正常情况下——当她和真嗣处于恋爱关系时——她大概会假装生气并责备他。这不过是玩笑性质的，而且如果她猜得没错，真嗣其实挺喜欢她这样表现的。

But to Shinji who didn't really know her?  
但对于并不真正了解她的真嗣来说呢？

"Sure, I'm looking forward to it," Asuka smiled a warm smile. "You know, I always like the food you cook."  
“当然，我很期待，”明日香露出温暖的笑容。“你知道的，我总是喜欢你做的食物。”

"Um, thanks?" Shinji replied with a slightly embarrassed smile.  
“呃，谢谢？” 真嗣带着些许尴尬的微笑回答道。

Needless to say, it was awkward for both of them.  
不用说，两人都感到很尴尬。

To know that someone you don't even know is your girlfriend...  
得知一个你甚至不认识的人是你的女朋友……

And to know that someone you loved doesn't love you...  
而得知你所爱的人不再爱你……

Asuka shook the thoughts off. It was better than being dead, she supposed.  
明日香甩开了这些念头。她想，总比死了好。

As long as they were still alive, then there was still a chance.  
只要他们还活着，就还有希望。

What caused him to forget, though? Could she do something about it? To make him remember, at least partially?  
究竟是什么让他遗忘了呢？她能做些什么来补救吗？至少让他部分地回忆起来？

"How do you feel about me, Shinji?" Asked Asuka with a hint of dread in her voice.  
“你对我的感觉如何，真嗣？”明日香问道，声音中带着一丝不安。

_Please...remember something...  
请...记得些什么吧..._

"Huh?" Shinji raised his eyebrows, an intense blush immediately exploded on his face. "Err...I...don't know?"  
"啊？" 真嗣扬起眉毛，脸上立刻爆发出强烈的红晕。"呃...我...不知道？"

Even though his answer was much expected, it didn't help soothe the pain inside her chest. She might need to take a more direct approach. "Do you think I'm pretty?"  
尽管他的回答在意料之中，但这并没有缓解她胸中的痛楚。她可能需要采取更直接的方式。"你觉得我漂亮吗？"

This time, the blush on Shinji's face turned incandescent. "Um...yes? I mean, of course."  
这一次，真嗣脸上的红晕变得异常明显。"嗯...是的？我是说，当然。"

Perhaps he said it only for the sake of not wanting to piss her off, but it was small progress nonetheless. Asuka knew she might be on the right route and decided to carry on. "Follow me," she demanded as she grabbed his wrist and dragged him into her bedroom.  
或许他这么说只是为了避免惹恼她，但无论如何，这是小小的进步。明日香知道她可能走对了路，决定继续下去。“跟我来，”她命令道，抓住他的手腕，将他拖进她的卧室。

Pulling out two black boxes from under the bed, Asuka opened the first one, revealing a cello inside it. "Your cello, I brought it from the old apartment."  
从床底下拉出两个黑色盒子，明日香打开第一个，里面是一把大提琴。“你的大提琴，我从旧公寓带过来的。”

"Thank you so much Asuka!" Shinji's face immediately lit up as he stepped forward, trying to grab the cello.  
“非常感谢你，明日香！”真嗣的脸立刻亮了起来，他向前迈步，试图去拿那把大提琴。

"Hold on a second," Asuka pulled her hand away along with the cello. "There is one condition."  
"等一下，" 明日香抽回手，连同大提琴一起。"有一个条件。"

"Yes?" “是？”

"Duet with me," Asuka said as she pulled her violin out of the second box.  
"和我合奏，" 明日香说着从第二个盒子里拿出小提琴。"

Shinji's eyes widened after a quick examination of the instrument. "Asuka...where did you get this?"  
真嗣快速检查了一下乐器后，眼睛睁大了。"明日香...这东西你从哪儿弄来的？"

"You sent this to me as a gift, remember?" Said Asuka, her eyes gleamed expectance.  
"你记得吗，这是你送给我的礼物？" 明日香说道，眼中闪烁着期待的光芒。

"What?!" Shinji almost jumped. "I guess it makes sense, but...this is so expensive! How did I get so much money?"  
"什么？！" 真嗣差点跳了起来。"我猜这说得通，但是...这太贵重了！我哪来这么多钱？"

"Your pilot wages, and If I'm correct, you still have dozens of millions in your account," Asuka shrugged.  
"你的驾驶员薪水，而且如果我没记错的话，你账户里还有好几千万呢，" 明日香耸了耸肩。

Shinji's mixture of expression left no doubt of how he felt about this revelation.  
真嗣脸上的复杂表情无疑表明了他对这个消息的感受。

"Hey idiot, you still haven't answered my question yet," Asuka snapped her fingers in front of his eyes, trying to bring him back to reality. "Duet, or not?" Even though it was a question, her tone made it clear that denial was out of the question.  
“嘿，傻瓜，你还没回答我的问题呢，”明日香在他眼前弹了弹手指，试图让他回到现实中来。“二重唱，还是不唱？”尽管这是个问句，但她的语气表明否认是不可能的。

"Sure," Shinji replied with clear submissiveness. "Let me turn off the stove first."  
“当然，”真嗣顺从地回答。“让我先关掉炉子。”

After Shinji came back, the boy found Asuka already in position - sitting on the chair with the violin and the bow in her hands. No matter how embarrassing it was for Shinji, he still wanted to play some cello himself.  
在真嗣回来后，他发现明日香已经就位——坐在椅子上，手里拿着小提琴和弓。尽管对真嗣来说这很尴尬，但他还是想亲自拉一会儿大提琴。

Shinji grabbed his cello and sat down beside her with a sheepish expression. "Um, what do you want to play?"  
真嗣拿起他的大提琴，带着尴尬的表情坐在她旁边。“呃，你想演奏什么？”

"Have you heard of Beautiful World?"  
“你听说过《美丽世界》吗？”

"Yeah, but I didn't really practice it. It's not really a cello song, after all."  
"是啊，但我其实没怎么练习过。毕竟这本来就不是一首大提琴曲。"

"Then I'll play the main melody, and you'll play the chord."  
"那我来弹主旋律，你负责和弦。"

"Okay." “好的。”

As Asuka slid the bow across the string, the melody flowed through the apartment like a river of music. It carried so many memories, happy or sad, treasured or painful.  
当明日香拉动弓弦，旋律如音乐之河般流淌过整个公寓。它承载了太多记忆，无论是欢乐还是悲伤，珍贵抑或痛苦。

She didn't know whether this would have an effect on Shinji, but she had to do her best.  
她不知道这会不会对真嗣产生影响，但她必须尽全力。

Closing her eyes, slowly, Asuka started singing.  
闭上眼睛，慢慢地，明日香开始唱了起来。

_It's only love 这只是爱_

_If I could have only one wish  
如果我只能许一个愿望_

_Let me sleep right next to you; it doesn't matter where  
让我睡在你身边；无论何处都无所谓_

_Beautiful world 美丽的世界_

_I'm gazing only at you, no hesitation  
我只凝视着你，毫不犹豫_

_Beautiful boy 美丽的少年_

_You don't still know your beauty  
你还未知晓自己的美貌_

_It's only love 这只是爱_

_Asleep or awake, teen comics  
无论醒着还是睡着，青春漫画_

_I hate myself being a foolish dreamer  
我讨厌自己成为一个愚蠢的梦想家_

_I don't know what I want, but all I see  
我不知道我想要什么，但我所见_

_Is soft tears streaming down my cheeks  
是温柔的泪水顺着脸颊流淌_

_I've got nothing to say  
我无话可说_

_Just want to see you again  
只想再见你一面_

_Can't say what I want to  
无法说出心中所愿_

_May not have the heart  
或许已无心再续_

_But whatever 但无所谓了_

There was a subtle change of expression on Shinji's face; he didn't try to hide it, and continued to accompany Asuka.  
真嗣的脸上闪过一丝微妙的表情；他没有试图掩饰，而是继续陪伴着明日香。

The redhead soon found herself lost in the world of music.  
红发少女很快便沉浸在了音乐的世界中。

The boy she loved was right next to her...  
她所爱的男孩就在她身旁...

So close...yet so unreachable.  
如此近在咫尺...却又遥不可及。

Asuka knew that she was addicted to his love.  
明日香知道她已沉溺于他的爱中。

Even though this Shinji wasn't the Shinji she knew anymore, Asuka knew who he _could've_ become, and how much he could love her.  
尽管这个真嗣已不再是她所认识的那个真嗣，但明日香知道他可能变成什么样，以及他有多么爱她。

Asuka put up all of her self-restraint just to stop herself from pouncing at him and smash their lips together. She knew it would scare him away.  
明日香竭尽全力克制自己，才没有扑向他，将两人的唇紧紧贴在一起。她知道那样会吓跑他。

"That was beautiful, Shinji," Asuka smiled at him after the last note faded.  
“真嗣，那真是太美了。”最后一个音符消散后，明日香对他微笑道。

Shinji smiled back. The smile was so familiar to her. "Thank you, Asuka."  
真嗣回以微笑。那个笑容对她来说再熟悉不过了。“谢谢你，明日香。”

Something was working. 有什么在起作用。

Asuka rushed into her bedroom and rummaged through the small room. "Here you are!" She exclaimed as she found the roll of paper she held dearly inside the deepest level of her wardrobe.  
明日香冲进她的卧室，在小房间里翻找着。“你在这儿！”她兴奋地喊道，终于在衣柜最深处找到了她珍藏的那卷纸。

The redhead carried the roll of paper to the living room. "Here, take a look at your masterpiece." Asuka rolled the portrait open for Shinji to see.  
红发女孩将那卷纸带到客厅。“来，看看你的杰作。”明日香为真嗣展开了那幅肖像画。

Just like she had expected, a blush immediately exploded on Shinji's face before he hastily moved his eyes away from it. "A-Asuka!"  
正如她所预料的，真嗣的脸颊立刻泛起了红晕，他慌忙移开了视线。“A-明日香！”

"See this? Ich Liebe Shinji! It means I love you. I love you, idiot!" Asuka exclaimed, taking out the promising ring she spent a lot of effort to find on the floor. "Here, the rings we bought together! We loved each other, you _have to remember at least something!_"  
“看这个？Ich Liebe Shinji！意思是‘我爱你’。我爱你，傻瓜！”明日香激动地说着，从地上拿出了那枚她费尽心思找到的戒指。“看，我们一起买的戒指！我们相爱过，你至少得记得这一点！”

"I don't know, Asuka," Shinji sighed. "As far as I know, I only know you for two days."  
"我不知道，明日香，" 真嗣叹息道。"据我所知，我只认识你两天。"

No words could tell how much his words hurt her.  
没有任何言语能表达他的话对她造成的伤害有多深。

She hid it really well, though.  
不过，她隐藏得很好。

"However…" "然而…"

Asuka raised her head. "Speak."  
明日香抬起头。"说。"

"I really don't know…but…" Asuka could see his eyes became fonder as he spoke. "When we played that music together, I feel warm and content inside…"  
"我真的不知道…但是…" 明日香可以看到他说话时眼神变得更加温柔。"当我们一起演奏那首音乐时，我感到内心温暖而满足…"

"And those things you showed me...I don't remember seeing them before, but at the same time I do."  
"你给我看的东西...我不记得以前见过，但同时我又觉得见过。"

"The feelings I have… I've never felt anything like this ever before."  
"这种感觉...我以前从未有过类似的体验。"

She knew he was being totally honest.  
她知道他完全是在说实话。

"I don't know why…but…when I see you smile…I smile, too. I don't remember smiling like that to anyone else ever before. It was nice, though."  
“我不知道为什么……但……当我看到你笑……我也笑了。我不记得曾那样对别人笑过。不过，那种感觉很好。”

This time, it did bring a small smile to Asuka's face. Just like he said, Shinji couldn't help but smile back. "Well, think of ways to make me smile more often, then." Said Asuka, who didn't even make the slightest attempt to hide how much happier she was right now. Shinji was still the person she knew - not on the surface, but deep inside.  
这一次，确实让明日香脸上露出了淡淡的微笑。正如他所说，真嗣忍不住回以微笑。“那么，想办法让我更常笑吧。”明日香说道，丝毫没有掩饰她此刻的快乐。真嗣依然是她所认识的那个人——不是表面，而是内心深处。

If it would take her lifetime to make him love her again, then so be it.  
如果需要她用一生来让他再次爱上她，那就这样吧。

At least it meant that they would be spending time together.  
至少这意味着他们将共度时光。

Shinji retracted his smile by a little. "I don't know, Asuka. Are those feelings even _mine_? I mean, they came out of nowhere...I don't know you, but at the same time I feel like...like..." He let out a small sigh. "Like you are someone familiar whom I haven't seen in a long time."  
真嗣微微收起了笑容。“我不知道，明日香。这些感觉真的是我的吗？我是说，它们突然出现……我不了解你，但同时我又觉得……觉得……”他轻轻叹了口气。“就像是一个久未谋面的熟悉之人。”

_Even if the mind forgets...the heart still remembers.  
即使大脑遗忘……心灵依然记得。_

"But...I can't just take your affection and be okay with it!" His eyes grew distant as he spoke. "I mean, when they told me that you're my girlfriend, and I fought monsters and saved the world...saved _you_...he isn't me."  
"但是...我不能就这样接受你的感情，然后心安理得！" 他的眼神变得遥远，说话间流露出迷茫。"我是说，当他们告诉我你是我的女朋友，而我战斗怪兽、拯救世界...救了你...那人不是我。"

"I don't even know how did I get there! Giant machines? Angels? What even are they?! It's not me who did all those things! How can I just claim what he-"  
"我甚至不知道我是怎么到那里的！巨大的机器？天使？它们到底是什么？！那些事不是我做的！我怎么能就这样宣称是他-"

He was cut off by a finger pressed on his lips. Asuka's way of shutting him up always worked perfectly. "Then just forget about them," said Asuka. If anything, she was happy that Shinji didn't need to suffer through the Angel Wars. The memories when fighting the Angels were almost all painful. "Even if you don't have the memories...you're still Shinji. Shinji is Shinji, nothing more."  
他的话被按在唇上的手指打断了。明日香总是能完美地让他闭嘴。"那就忘了它们吧，"明日香说。如果有什么不同，她很高兴真嗣不必经历天使战争的痛苦。那些与天使战斗的记忆几乎全是痛苦的。"即使你没有那些记忆...你仍然是真嗣。真嗣就是真嗣，仅此而已。"

It seemed like he had more to counter, but Shinji swallowed the words. He pondered for a moment and sighed, "but...Do I have to…love you? I mean, I don't think I can ever love anybody…Even if I could, what if...I can't love you as much as he loved you?"  
他似乎还有更多话要反驳，但真嗣咽下了那些词句。他沉思片刻，叹了口气，“但是……我必须……爱你吗？我是说，我觉得我可能永远无法爱上任何人……即使我能，如果……我不能像他那样爱你那么多呢？”

"I'm willing to give you a chance," Asuka said, even though the truth was she would never let him leave her. "You accept?"  
“我愿意给你一个机会，”明日香说，尽管事实是她永远不会让他离开她。“你接受吗？”

"I...can try." Shinji gulped after seeing the piercing glare Asuka shoot him, "I mean, I will try…if it makes you smile. It makes me feel nice, too."  
“我……可以试试。”看到明日香投来的锐利目光，真嗣咽了口唾沫，“我是说，我会尝试……如果这能让你微笑。这让我也感觉很好。”

Asuka chuckled. 明日香轻声笑了起来。

"You, are really an idiot…"  
"你啊，真是个大笨蛋……"
