**CHAPTER 1: STRANGER IN THE NIGHT.  
第一章：夜间的陌生人。**

It was a typical evening in Tokyo-3. Especially for one foursome, Misato Katsuragi, Rei Ayanami, Asuka Soryu, and of course Shinji Ikari. All four were out on a night walk after a wild night out which of course saw two of the four women get absolutely hammered (as in drunk). Surprisingly one of the two people would've never thought to have seen in that shape, and the other one was all but assured of it. However, the one assured of it was actually quite sober compared to the other two.  
这是东京第三区一个典型的夜晚。特别是对于四人组来说，葛城美里、绫波丽、惣流·明日香·兰格雷，当然还有碇真嗣。四人在疯狂的一夜之后外出散步，其中两位女士显然喝得酩酊大醉。令人惊讶的是，其中一位本不会让人想到会醉成这样，而另一位则几乎是意料之中。然而，意料之中的那位实际上比其他两位要清醒得多。

"Hey watch where you're going dumkopf" Asuka slurred completely unable to walk in a straight line leaning on Shinji's shoulder to maintain balance.  
“嘿，看路啊，笨蛋！”明日香含糊不清地说道，完全无法直线行走，只能靠在真嗣的肩膀上保持平衡。

"Hey you…you…you don't say that to my brother" Rei Slurred back, "He's not shtupid he's just…. Just… just… yes!" She blurted out incoherently.  
"嘿，你…你…你不该那样说我弟弟" 丽含糊地反驳道，"他不是傻，他只是…只是…只是…对！" 她语无伦次地脱口而出。

"Ah Jeez" Misato sighed, almost one hundred percent sober, she held Rei's shoulder as Rei staggered all around the sidewalk as well.  
"哎呀，真是的" 美里叹了口气，她几乎百分百清醒，扶着丽摇摇晃晃地在人行道上走。

"I told you we shouldn't have brought them along Misato. Asuka can't control herself, Rei's never really been out, and you well…" Shinji began to explain  
"我早就说过我们不该带他们来的，美里。明日香控制不住自己，丽又从没真正出来过，至于你嘛…" 真嗣开始解释道

"Don't go there Ikari. Or I'll smack you upside the head so hard you'll wish you had an AT Field" Misato growled in response  
"别去那儿，碇。否则我会狠狠地给你一巴掌，让你恨不得自己有个 AT 力场。" 惣流咆哮着回应道。

Shinji winced; just the thought of her being that violent was enough to make him shudder. It'd been 2 months since the final Angel had been defeated and third impact was avoided, but still defeating the angel's was nothing compared to the wrath of the three women standing around him. All three were not only extremely beautiful, but they were also very deadly. Asuka most of all, Shinji learned that the hard way being on the receiving end of many of the fiery German's beatings. All the same though, he couldn't help but feel compassion towards Asuka, her story wasn't all that different from his. A father that didn't want her, a mother that died when she was young, someone who had no one growing up. Shinji couldn't help but feel for her, he knew deep down under that hard-edged exterior was a scared little girl who needed to be held and told she was loved, no matter how much she tried to fight it. He brushed his hands through her hair; all too soon he realized that was a big mistake.  
真嗣打了个寒颤；光是想到她如此暴力就足以让他颤抖。自从最后一个使徒被击败，第三次冲击被避免以来，已经过去了两个月，但击败使徒与周围这三位女性的怒火相比，根本不值一提。这三位不仅极其美丽，而且非常致命。尤其是明日香，真嗣深有体会，他曾多次成为这位火爆德国少女的打击对象。尽管如此，他还是忍不住对明日香心生同情，她的故事与他的并无太大不同。一个不想要她的父亲，一个在她年幼时去世的母亲，一个在成长过程中无人依靠的人。真嗣不禁为她感到难过，他深知在那坚硬的外表下，是一个需要被拥抱和被告知被爱的害怕的小女孩，无论她如何努力抗拒。他轻抚着她的头发；很快他就意识到这是一个巨大的错误。

"UND FUSTUKEN IDOIT!" Asuka yelled in rage, slapping Shinji twice across each cheek. In the process Shinji released Asuka, and fell back on the ground. **(A/N: I don't know how to type German so if anyone does sorry for butchering the language).**  
"UND FUSTUKEN IDOIT!" 明日香愤怒地吼道，连续两次用力扇了真嗣每个脸颊。在这个过程中，真嗣松开了明日香，跌坐在地上。（作者注：我不知道怎么打德语，如果有人知道，对不起我糟蹋了这门语言。）

"ASUKA!" Misato screamed, "What was that for?" she ran to Shinji's side helping him to his feet.  
"明日香！" 美里尖叫道，"你这是为什么？" 她跑到真嗣身边，扶他站起来。

"That Idiot was trying to take advantage of me," Asuka slurred again,  
"那个白痴想占我便宜，" 明日香再次含糊地说，

"NO he wasn't" Misato shot back, "he was trying to make sure you were ok"  
"不，他没有。" 美里反驳道，"他只是想确认你没事。"

Misato had been rooming with both Shinji and Asuka for about six months now. As much as she teased Shinji about his habits, she still deeply cared for the boy. He was the closest thing she ever had to a son, and would likely be the closest she'd ever get. After Kaji's death **(A/N: Yes sorry to all you fangirls, Kaji won't be appearing)** Misato just couldn't see herself with anyone else. She'd fallen so deeply in love with Kaji, it was a complete heartbreak when she lost him. The wound was so deep that she truly felt that she'd never love again. In her wallet sat a five by ten photo of her and Kaji by far her most treasured item. Depicted in the photo was a younger version of the two lovers, obviously in a photo booth at a carnival of some sort, Kaji with his arm wrapped around Misato's shoulders and his lips pressed to her cheek as Misato flashed the peace sign to the camera. She sighed, oh how she missed those days, she was brought back to reality when she heard a bit of rustling the bushes. The others couldn't hear it but Misato had excellent hearing due to her many years of training at NERV.  
美里与真嗣和明日香同住已有六个月。尽管她经常调侃真嗣的习惯，但她对这孩子仍怀有深厚的关怀。真嗣是她迄今为止最接近儿子的存在，也可能是她未来最亲近的人。自从加持死后（作者注：是的，抱歉了各位粉丝，加持不会出现），美里无法想象自己还能与他人相伴。她曾深爱加持，失去他时心如刀割。那伤痕如此之深，她真心觉得再也无法去爱。她的钱包里珍藏着一张五乘十的照片，那是她和加持，无疑是她最珍视的物品。照片中，年轻的两人显然是在某个嘉年华的照相亭里，加持手臂环绕着美里的肩膀，嘴唇轻触她的脸颊，而美里则对着镜头比出和平手势。她叹了口气，多么怀念那些日子啊，直到听到灌木丛中一阵窸窣声，她才回过神来。其他人或许听不见，但美里因多年在 NERV 的训练，听力异常敏锐。

As Misato went to investigate the disturbance she looked at Rei across from her. Not surprisingly Rei began to retch and place her hand over her mouth looking for a place to empty the contents of her stomach. Misato rushed over to comfort the poor girl as she found an area on the sidewalk to do her thing.  
当碇真嗣去调查骚动时，她看向对面的绫波丽。不出所料，绫波丽开始干呕，用手捂住嘴，寻找地方将胃里的东西吐出来。碇真嗣急忙过去安慰这个可怜的女孩，帮她在人行道上找了个地方。

Misato sat there patting Rei's back, as she went about throwing up in the gutter. She sat Rei down, comforting the poor girl as she continued to go about her puking rage.  
碇真嗣坐在那里，轻拍着绫波丽的背，看着她在排水沟里呕吐。她让绫波丽坐下，继续安慰这个可怜的女孩，同时她还在继续她的呕吐。

_And I thought I was bad when I was drunk_ Misato thought to herself, as Rei let out another stream of what was in her stomach. Misato continued to comfort she looked at Shinji who was having his own problems with his fiery redheaded friend.  
我还以为我喝醉时已经够糟了，碇真嗣心想，这时绫波丽又吐出了一股胃里的东西。碇真嗣继续安慰她，同时看向了正在和火红头发的朋友闹别扭的碇真嗣。

Asuka's situation wasn't much better. She saw Rei's little escapade and began to join in. Shinji comforted her as well  
明日香的状况也没好到哪里去。她看到绫波的小冒险，也开始加入其中。真嗣同样安慰了她

"Leave me alone" Asuka slurred, "I… I cun tak car of miself" she managed out before going back to her previous business.  
“别管我”明日香含糊地说，“我…我自己能照顾自己”她勉强说完，又继续做她之前的事。

"Yeah you look like it" Shinji muttered now a little ticked that he was still helping the girl that had just recently given him another taste of her wrath.  
“是啊，你看起来确实如此”真嗣低声嘟囔，有点恼火自己还在帮助那个刚刚又让他尝到她怒火的女孩。

"What was that third chi…" she couldn't finished as she turned to him she let out a huge vomit stream right on Shinji's lap.  
"那第三股气是什么…" 她话未说完，一转身对着他便是一阵猛烈的呕吐，直喷在真嗣的腿上。

"JESUS CHRIST!" Shinji cursed, "WHAT THE HELL ASUKA!" he berated on her, now officially at his limit with her antics. He'd taken care of her when she was sick, got her out of her coma, and this was how she repayed him. By treating him like shit. Shinji couldn't stand it anymore, and finally all of his pent up energy was being unleashed.  
"天哪！" 真嗣咒骂道，"你到底想怎样，明日香！" 他斥责她，此刻对她的小动作彻底忍无可忍。他曾在她生病时照顾她，将她从昏迷中唤醒，而她却以这种方式回报他，将他视如粪土。真嗣再也忍受不了，终于，他积压已久的怒火爆发了。

"I mean Come on you think you'd learn after a while! When you drink too much this shit happens, thank you very much. Asuka don't you ever learn I mean…" He stopped as he looked in the glistening eyes of the girl who he'd just hurt.  
我是说，拜托，你以为过段时间你就能学会吗！当你喝太多的时候，这种破事就会发生，非常感谢。明日香，你难道永远学不乖吗，我是说……" 他停了下来，因为他看到了刚刚被他伤害的女孩那双闪烁的眼睛。

"Shinji… I…. I…." Asuka began but couldn't get anything out as she just got even more sick, retching again, but this time turning to the sidewalk to unleash another stream of vomit.  
“真嗣…我…我…”明日香开口了，但什么也说不出来，她感到更加恶心，再次呕吐起来，这次转向人行道，又吐出了一股。

Misato, who'd overheard the whole conversation, pulled Shinji aside now very upset with him.  
听到整个对话的美里，此刻非常生气地把真嗣拉到一边。

"How could you say that Shinji? That was so unlike you, it was downright mean, and uncalled for" Misato snarled,  
“你怎么能这么说，真嗣？那太不像你了，简直是刻薄，而且毫无必要。”美里怒斥道，

"I…. I…I…" was all Shinji could muster as he was shocked at what'd he'd just said to Asuka  
“我…我…我…”真嗣震惊于自己刚刚对明日香说的话，只能结结巴巴地吐出这几个字。

"Save it Kiddo, all you do is apologize. Just stop, Asuka needs you right now. Go help her" Misato demanded pointing her finger over to the still vomiting Asuka  
"省省吧，小家伙，你只会道歉。现在别说了，明日香现在需要你。快去帮她。" 美里命令道，手指指向仍在呕吐的明日香

"But Misato." Shinji began to protest  
"但是，美里。" 真嗣开始抗议

"But nothing Shinji, Now go!" She demanded again  
"没什么但是的，真嗣，现在就去！" 她再次命令道

"Yes Ma'am" Shinji responded dejectedly as he slumped his way over to Asuka  
"是的，女士。" 真嗣沮丧地回答道，拖着沉重的步伐走向明日香

"A-Asuka?" Shinji began worriedly as Asuka picked her head up  
"A-Asuka?" 真嗣担心地开口，此时明日香抬起头来

"Whadaya wan dumkopf?" Asuka slurred  
"你想干嘛，笨蛋？" 明日香含糊地说道

"I'm not gonna apologize but let me help you out" Shinji replied  
"我不会道歉，但让我帮你一把。" 真嗣回答道

"I said I cun tak car of miself, now jus lea me alone" Asuka slurred again trying to sit up straight, but immediately feeling a wave of nausea hit and keeling back over to empty more unsightly puddles on the ground.  
"我说了我能照顾自己，现在就让我一个人待着。" 明日香口齿不清地再次尝试坐直，但立刻感到一阵恶心袭来，又弯腰吐出更多令人不快的污物。

"It's ok Asuka, you can be vulnerable sometimes" Shinji comforted as he rubbed her back in a circular motion trying to ease her queasy stomach  
"没关系，明日香，偶尔脆弱也没关系。" 真嗣安慰着，用手在她背上做圆周运动，试图缓解她的胃部不适。

"No I can't, I have to be strong. I'm Asuka Langelly Soryu, I'm the second child, the pilot of EVA Unit 02, and I….I….I…. I FEEL LIKE SHIT!" With that she let loose a huge projectile of vomit that would've covered anyone within a few feet.  
“不，我不能，我必须坚强。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员，而我……我……我……我感觉糟透了！”说完，她猛地吐出一大滩呕吐物，足以覆盖几英尺内的一切。

She lifted her face up eyes glistening again, giving a very sorrow filled look to Shinji. On the verge of tears she looked him directly in the eyes,  
她抬起头，眼中再次闪烁着泪光，向真嗣投去一个充满悲伤的眼神。眼看着就要落泪，她直视着他的眼睛，

"I'm a disgrace" was all she said before turning away from Shinji.  
"我真是个耻辱"，她丢下这句话后便转身离开了真嗣。

Shinji looked at Asuka's sad face. She was a complete mess, her makeup was running slightly, She couldn't form a sentence that made any sense whatsoever, and there were parts of vomit on the sides of her mouth. His heart went out to her. He'd always admired Asuka's determination and skill as a pilot. At times she could even be dare he say nice, and extremely helpful with his schoolwork. She was also not bad looking, downright beautiful and just an incredibly wonderful person. That was why he'd fallen for her, and hard too. He had to laugh at himself, this was the same woman who'd treated him like shit for months, she constantly berated his apologetic and polite nature, and she'd gone so far as to say she hated him. All the same he couldn't help but fall head over heels for her. He knew deep down Asuka was exactly like him, just a scared little child that had nothing or no one to hold on to at the end of the day.  
真嗣看着明日香悲伤的面庞，她整个人一团糟，妆容略微晕开，说话语无伦次，嘴角还残留着呕吐物的痕迹。他心疼不已。他一直钦佩明日香作为驾驶员的决心和技能。有时她甚至可以说是友好，对他的学业帮助极大。她长得也不赖，简直是美丽动人，一个极其出色的人。这就是他为何会爱上她，而且爱得深沉。他自嘲地笑了，这个女人曾数月如一日地对他冷嘲热讽，不断贬低他那歉疚而礼貌的本性，甚至直言不讳地说她讨厌他。尽管如此，他还是无法自拔地爱上了她。他深知，明日香内心深处和他一样，只是一个在一天结束时无所依靠、恐惧无助的小孩。

He placed his hand on her chin and turned her face so that she was looking directly in his eyes.  
他把手放在她的下巴上，轻轻转动她的脸，让她直视他的眼睛。

_Have his eyes always been so… deep and beautiful?_ Asuka wondered to herself, She continued to look deeper into his eyes that seemed to penetrate her very being, hypnotizing, mesmerizing, enchanting her. The Shinji she saw in front of her was the one that so very rarely made an appearance. A confident, strong and at times independent young man, someone who'd she'd fallen head over heels for, or at least wanted to.  
他的眼睛一直这么……深邃而美丽吗？明日香暗自思忖。她继续凝视着他那仿佛能洞悉她灵魂深处的眼眸，那眼神催眠、迷醉、魅惑着她。眼前的真嗣，是那个极少展现的自己——一个自信、坚强，有时又独立自主的青年，是她为之倾倒，或至少渴望去爱的人。

"Now Now, let's get you cleaned up" Shinji said in a calm tone. With that he began to fix up Asuka taking a handkerchief out of his pocket. He started dabbing her tear stained cheeks wiping away the remnants of eyeliner and blush that mixed together to form a rather unsightly grey on her cheeks. Next he moved to her mouth and stared just for a few seconds. Her lips were absolutely perfect, not a flaw nor a blemish anywhere, he wanted so bad to cover them with his own, but thought better of it, Asuka was vulnerable right now and that would be something he would expect out of Kensuke or Touji not himself. He slowly moved his hand to his other pocket and pulled out a napkin he'd taken from the restaurant. Some girl had written her phone number on it with the message "call me." Shinji chuckled slightly the girl was nice, offering to buy him a drink and give him a ride home, but his heart already belonged to someone. His goddess, his queen, the spitfire German in front of him. Slowly he wiped the corners of her mouth that were covered in the remnants of vomit she'd been unleashing for the last few minutes. He smiled at her as he tossed the napkin into a nearby trashcan.  
"好了好了，我来帮你清理一下。" 碇真嗣用平静的语气说道。他随即开始照顾明日香，从口袋里掏出一块手帕，轻拭她泪痕斑斑的脸颊，擦去混合在一起形成难看灰色的眼线和腮红残留。接着，他的目光转向她的嘴唇，凝视了几秒。她的双唇完美无瑕，没有任何瑕疵，他极想用自己的唇覆盖上去，但理智告诉他，明日香此刻很脆弱，这种行为更像是洞木光或铃原东治会做的，而不是他。他缓缓将手伸向另一边口袋，取出一张从餐厅带出来的餐巾纸。上面有个女孩留下了电话号码和"给我打电话"的字样。碇真嗣轻笑一声，那女孩很友好，提出请他喝酒并送他回家，但他的心早已属于另一个人。他的女神，他的女王，眼前这位德国烈焰般的少女。他轻柔地擦拭她嘴角残留的呕吐物，那是她几分钟前不断吐出的。微笑着，他将餐巾纸扔进附近的垃圾桶。

"You alright?" Shinji asked,  
"你还好吗？" 真嗣问道，

"Fine now" Asuka replied, "Shinji thank you"  
"现在没事了"，明日香回答道，"真嗣，谢谢你"

"Don't mention it," he answered sheepishly.  
"不用谢，"他腼腆地回答。

Without thinking Asuka moved closer to Shinji. She felt his heartbeat quicken, but didn't mention it. Almost instinctively, Shinji pulled her into his chest and began to silently comfort her.  
未加思索，明日香向真嗣靠近。她感觉到他的心跳加速，却并未提及。几乎是本能地，真嗣将她拥入怀中，开始默默地安慰她。

A few feet away a certain Violet haired woman stood watching with a smirk on her face. She couldn't help it; it was too cute to see these two like this.  
几步之遥，一位紫发女子站在那里，脸上挂着一抹微笑。她忍不住，看到这两个人这样实在是太可爱了。

"They look pretty cute together don't they Rei? Rei?" Misato said looking around to find where the first child had gotten to. To her surprise and utter amusement she found Rei on the other side of the street flirting with a Stop sign.  
"他们看起来很可爱，不是吗，丽？丽？" 美里说着，四处寻找第一适格者的踪影。令她惊讶又好笑的是，她发现丽在街对面正和一个停车标志调情。

"So what's your name cutie?" Rei asked  
"那么，你叫什么名字，小可爱？" 丽问道

"Come on I won't laugh," she said again  
"别这样，我不会笑的，" 她再次说道

"A the strong silent type huh? Wow you're skinny but you must be huge" Rei said sliding her hand provocatively down the sign's metal pole  
“哦，是那种强壮寡言的类型吗？哇，你这么瘦，但一定很壮。”零说着，挑逗地把手顺着指示牌的金属杆滑下

"Come on I know you like me, it's written all over your face" Rei slurred. Rei was so smashed the letters S.T.O.P were replaced by R.E.I.  
“得了吧，我知道你喜欢我，全写在脸上了。”零醉醺醺地说道。他醉得厉害，连“S.T.O.P”都变成了“R.E.I”。

"What you want me to sing for you or something… Ok… here I go…. Ummm…. Wait…. I got it… stop in the name of love, before you break my heart… stop…" Rei began to sing  
"你想让我给你唱首歌还是怎么的…好吧…我开始唱了…嗯…等等…我想到了…以爱的名义停下，别让我的心碎…停…" 丽开始唱道

"Rei!" Misato laughed, "come on I don't think he's your sign," she explained as she dragged the drunk Rei back to Shinji and Asuka.  
"丽！" 美里笑着说，"我觉得他不是你的菜，" 她一边解释一边把醉醺醺的丽拉回到真嗣和明日香身边。

"Call Me" Rei yelled back at the sign. And then began to follow Misato's lead.  
"叫我" 丽对着招牌大声回应。然后开始跟随美里的引导。

Misato was now concerned with the other couple and their struggles. Asuka was still pretty screwed up from the alcohol. She was amazed to see Shinji and Asuka's gaze locked on each other.  
现在，葛城美里关注着另一对情侣及其挣扎。明日香仍因酒精而状态不佳。她惊讶地看到真嗣和明日香的目光紧紧锁定彼此。

_Jesus Shinji just kiss her already!_ Misato thought to herself as she watched the 2 "lovebirds" just stare at each other. Before she reached them another rustle in the bushes caught her ears. This time she glanced over and saw a shadow figure moving around.  
耶稣啊，真嗣，你就快亲她吧！美里心里想着，看着那对'恋人'只是互相凝视。在她走近他们之前，灌木丛中又传来一阵沙沙声，吸引了她的注意。这次她瞥了一眼，看到一个影子在移动。

_It would seem we have a visitor well no need to worry Shinji about this I'll take care of it myself_ Misato thought to herself, as she approached Shinji and Asuka.  
"看来我们有访客了，别担心，真嗣，这事我来处理。"美里心里想着，同时走向真嗣和明日香。

"Hey you two, if you get any closer you're either gonna be on top of each other…." Misato smirked at her snide comment. She knew what she meant when she said "on top of" but she would let the two figure it out.  
"嘿，你们俩，再靠近一点就要叠在一起了……"美里对她那刻薄的评论咧嘴一笑。她知道她说的"叠在一起"是什么意思，但她会让那两个人自己去领会。

"Oh shut it Mizato" Asuka slurred yet again "Shin…. I mean Third boy over here is too chicken to try anything"  
"哦，闭嘴吧，水户" 明日香再次含糊地说道，"真……我是说那边第三个男孩，他太胆小了，不敢尝试任何事"

"Yeah Misato, Second girl would deck me if I tried anything anyways" Shinji smiled slightly (try saying that three times fast) at least sometimes he and Asuka agreed on things. Especially when it came to their relationship together.  
“是啊，美里，就算我想做什么，第二个女孩也会揍我一顿。” 真嗣微微一笑（试着快速说三遍），至少有时候他和明日香在某些事情上能达成共识。尤其是在他们之间的关系上。

"Whatever" Misato responded, and walked up to the two guiding Rei along side of her.  
"随便吧"，葛城回应道，然后走到两人身边，与他们一同引导绫波。

"Now Shinji I need you to take Rei and Asuka home ok?" Misato asked,  
“现在，真嗣，我需要你带绫波和明日香回家，好吗？” 美里问道，

"Yay Shleepover!" Rei cheered "Can we bring that skinny guy with the red face over there? He's so fine!" Rei slurred, referencing her stop sign love interest  
"耶，睡衣派对！" 丽欢呼道，"我们可以把那边那个脸红红的瘦子带来吗？他太帅了！" 丽含糊地说，指的是她对那位路牌情有独钟的兴趣

"No Rei I don't think he's going anywhere anytime soon" Misato answered with a slight chuckle. _Who knew Rei was such a flirty drunk?_ She thought to herself.  
"不，零，我觉得他一时半会儿哪儿也不会去。" 惣流轻笑一声回答道。谁知道零喝醉了这么会撩人呢？她暗自思忖。

"Ummm…. OK sure, you want me to take Rei to her apartment?" Shinji asked  
"呃……好吧，你希望我送绫波回她的公寓吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No she's staying with us tonight, I'll have to help her in the morning anyways" Misato answered  
"不，她今晚和我们在一起，反正我早上也得帮她。" 碇真嗣回答道

"Ok but where do I put her to sleep Misato?" Shinji asked  
"好的，但是我该把她安置在哪里睡觉呢，美里？" 真嗣问道

"That's up to you kiddo, ok now just go," Misato ordered  
“这取决于你，小家伙，好了，现在去吧，” 碇司令命令道

"Of course Misato but where are you going?" Shinji asked  
“当然，美里，但是你要去哪里？” 真嗣问道

"Well I've got some business to attend to but I won't be too far behind you. Be careful on the way home," Misato explained  
“我有点事要处理，但不会落后你太远。回家的路上小心点，” 碇真嗣解释道。

"Yes Ma'am" Shinji answered with that he began to stand up Asuka ever so slowly.  
"是的，女士。" 真嗣回答道，他开始非常缓慢地将明日香扶起来。

"Shinji thank…" Asuka began as she stood up but the alcohol consumption had greatly affected her fatigue level as well and as she stood her knees buckled as she lost consciousness then fainted.  
"真嗣，谢谢…" 明日香刚站起来开口，但酒精的摄入也大大影响了她的疲劳程度，她刚一站起来，膝盖就发软，随即失去了意识，昏倒在地。

Luckily Shinji saw it happening and positioned himself on Asuka's right and caught her with his left arm before she hit the ground. In one fluid motion and not really thinking about it he swung her legs into his right hand so that he was carrying her bridal style. Strangely it felt right, contrary to how he thought it would've felt to have this woman in his arms. It got a little stranger as Asuka snuggled ever so slightly into his chest, which made Shinji's heart go even more erratic than it already was. He looked at Rei who was blushing lightly at the scene between her brother and Asuka she gave a drunk smile before trying to make her way home. Luckily Shinji was able to keep an eye on her should she need help, and she seemed to be Ok walking after her little vomiting escapade. All 3 pilots began walking back to Misato's apartment.  
幸好，真嗣目睹了这一幕，迅速移动到明日香的右侧，用左臂在她落地前稳稳接住。他几乎是不假思索地流畅动作，将她的双腿移至右手，以公主抱的姿势将她抱起。奇怪的是，这种感觉出乎意料地对，与他预想中怀抱这位女性的感觉截然不同。更奇异的是，明日香微微依偎进他的胸膛，这让真嗣的心跳愈发狂乱。他看向绫波，她因眼前真嗣与明日香的情景而脸颊微红，露出一个微醺般的笑容，随后试图独自回家。幸运的是，真嗣能留意到她，以防她需要帮助，而她似乎在刚才的呕吐之后还能正常行走。三位驾驶员一同踏上了返回美里公寓的路途。

After they were out of earshot, Misato turned her attention to the shrub where the figure was waiting.  
待他们走远后，碇真嗣将目光转向了那片灌木丛，那里正藏着等待的人影。

"You can come out now" she smirked  
"你可以出来了"，她带着一丝戏谑的笑容说道

"Wow you are good" the figure replied  
"哇，你真厉害"，那身影回答道

"Yeah well let's dispense with the pleasantries, who are you and what do you want?" Misato questioned the stranger sharply  
"好了，客套话就免了，你是谁，你想要什么？" 碇真嗣尖锐地质问着陌生人

"Vell Vell Katsuragi… You're still zhust as lovely as I remember…." Misato picked up on a German accent in the voice one she'd thought she heard from many years ago  
"哎呀，葛城……你还是和我记忆中一样可爱……" 听到这个声音，真嗣立刻察觉到其中带有德国口音，这种口音她多年前似乎曾有所耳闻。

"Ok how do you know my name? Who the hell are you?" Misato said her anger and slight fear rising as she continued to interrogate this stranger. She began reaching for her gun holstered on her right leg.  
"好吧，你怎么知道我的名字？你到底是谁？" 随着继续审问这个陌生人，葛城美里的愤怒和些许恐惧逐渐升腾。她开始伸手去摸右腿上挂着的手枪。

"Vhy Misato has it really been zat long? Don't you remember a vellow classmate?" Again the accent is what caught her by surprise she stepped back  
"为什么真嗣已经这么久了吗？你不记得一个黄头发的同学了吗？" 又是那个口音让她感到意外，她后退了一步

"Step into the light" She ordered  
“走进光里。”她命令道

"Ach mine dear Major I could never rezist zuch a command vrom zuch a beautivul voman as yourzelf" With that the figure stepped into the light.  
"哎呀，我亲爱的少校，我怎么可能抗拒来自您这样美丽女士的命令呢"，说完，那身影便走进了灯光下。

Misato gasped in fear "No… this can't be… you can't be alive not after all this time"  
碇司令惊恐地倒吸一口凉气：“不……这不可能……过了这么久，你不可能还活着。”

The man stepped towards her "I'm avraid zo Misato, I'm ztill alive und doing ratzer vell for myzelf" he now stood completely basked in the light of the street lamp. His whole body was able to be seen but his face was obscured.  
男人向她走去，“我恐怕还是米萨托小姐，我还活着，并且过得相当不错。”他现在完全站在路灯的光芒下。他的整个身体都能被看见，但他的脸却被遮住了。

"H-How… the last time…." She tried to form a sentence but it was useless his eyes were locked on her and she couldn't resist keeping her gaze on them.  
"怎…怎么…上次…" 她试图组织语言，但徒劳无功，他的目光紧紧锁定着她，让她无法抗拒地凝视着他的眼睛。

The man in front of Misato stood about six feet tall, with pitch-black hair pulled into a ponytail in the back. His eyes though were the deepest shade of gold Misato had ever seen.  
站在三佐面前的男子身高约六英尺，一头漆黑的长发在脑后束成马尾。然而，他的眼睛却是三佐所见过的最深邃的金色。

"I zee now mine dear Major you do remember me, and here I vas beginning to zink zat you'd forgotten. But I guess I am not zat easy to forget now am I?" He brushed his hand along the left side of the Major's face.  
我现在明白了，亲爱的少校，你还记得我，而我刚才还在想你可能已经忘了。不过我想，我现在应该没那么容易被遗忘了吧，对吗？" 他用手轻抚少校的左脸颊。

Katsuragi tried to fight it but she just couldn't she was absolutely paralyzed by him. Unable to act or defend herself against this man, she was his pawn his servant; there was nothing she could do to resist him. If he ordered her to jump out in the middle of the street into oncoming traffic she'd had done it without question. She was merely a puppet to this man, and try as she might she was completely powerless compared to him.  
桂木尝试抵抗，却发现自己完全动弹不得，彻底被他震慑。面对这个男人，她既无法行动也无法自保，沦为了他的棋子、他的仆从；她无力反抗他。若他命令她冲到街道中央，迎向车流，她也会毫不犹豫地照做。在这个男人面前，她不过是个傀儡，尽管她竭力挣扎，与他相比却完全无能为力。

"Now mine dear" the man said sliding his hand down to her chin making sure eye contact was kept "ze three zat just left, vhere vere zey headed?" He asked with a smirk  
"现在，亲爱的"，男人说着，手滑向她的下巴，确保目光保持接触，"刚刚离开的那三个人，他们要去哪儿？"他带着一丝坏笑问道

"To my place" Misato answered quickly in monotone, a small tear leaked out of her right eye. Misato tried everything she could to break the spell that this man had cast over her. Once again her efforts proved futile.  
"去我那儿"，葛城美里用单调的语气迅速回答，一滴小小的泪珠从她的右眼溢出。她竭尽所能试图打破这个男人施加在她身上的魔咒，然而又一次，她的努力徒劳无功。

_What's going on? After his failed experiment five years ago I could have sworn…._ Her thoughts became a blur as his gaze penetrated deeper into her being.  
发生了什么？五年前他的实验失败后，我本可以发誓……他的目光穿透她的内心，她的思绪变得模糊不清。

"Now you vill take me to zis place of yours and introduce me to your vriends I am anxious to meet zem" The man ordered "Repeat zat"  
现在你得带我去你的地方，把我介绍给你的朋友们，我迫不及待想见他们。" 那人命令道，"重复一遍。"

"I will take you to my apartment and introduce you.." Misato repeated again in monotone.  
“我会带你去我的公寓并介绍你……” 碇真嗣再次用单调的语气重复道。

"Vunderbar mine dear Major. Now let's not keep our company vaiting." He began to walk letting Misato lead the way  
“太棒了，亲爱的少校。现在我们可别让我们的同伴久等了。”他开始走动，让碇真嗣带路。

_Shinji forgive me…_ was the last thought the major had before going into a complete mental blackout.  
真嗣，原谅我……这是少校在完全精神崩溃前的最后一个念头。

**At Misato's apartment: 在碇真嗣的公寓里：**

It took about fifteen minutes but Shinji finally made it up to the apartment. Once inside he settled Rei on the couch who had become rather tired after the alcohol and long walk. Shinji watched as his sister lilted over and fell into a drunken slumber.  
大约十五分钟后，真嗣终于到达了公寓。一进门，他便将因酒精和长途步行而显得疲惫不堪的绫波安置在沙发上。真嗣注视着妹妹摇摇晃晃地倒下，陷入了醉意朦胧的睡梦之中。

_Wow she's out like a light_ Shinji mentally remarked as Rei began sleeping peacefully on the couch. He then turned his attention to the fiery German in his arms.  
真嗣心里暗想，她睡得真沉，就像熄灭的灯火一样。这时，绫波丽已经在沙发上安详地睡着了。他随即把注意力转向怀中那位热情如火的德国女孩。

"Mama…" Asuka mumbled in her sleep.  
"妈妈…" 明日香在睡梦中喃喃自语。

_Oh not again_ Shinji complained mentally with that came the tears out of her eyes. A lump formed in Shinji's throat as his heart went out to the redhead.  
哦，又来了，真嗣在心里抱怨着，泪水不由自主地从她的眼角滑落。看着那红发女孩，真嗣的喉咙像是堵了一块，心中充满了同情。

After her ordeal with the fifteenth Angel, codenamed Arael her confidence and mental stability was shot. Had it not been for Shinji's love and care for her over the months that followed it was likely Asuka would've shared the same. She had told him how useless and weak she felt after the fight and how empty inside she truly was. His heart broke with her story and from that day the cowardly Shinji was hard to find when around Asuka. He'd been more confident and strong willed around the young German, not standing for any of her verbal taunts. He managed to fire back with some of his own verbal volleys. In a weird way these spats made the two grow closer and eventually begin to desire each other's company. Shinji shook himself out of his reverie and went back to the task at hand. Slowly he carried Asuka, who seemed to weigh next to nothing in his arms, to her room. He laid her gently into her bed and tucked the covers over her skin as if she were his own child. Lightly he touched her forehead and said a quick goodnight to her.  
在与第十五使徒，代号阿拉尔的苦战后，她的信心与精神状态遭受重创。若非随后数月里真嗣对她的关爱与支持，明日香或许也会步其后尘。她曾向真嗣倾诉，战后自己感到多么无用与软弱，内心又是何等空虚。真嗣听闻她的遭遇，心如刀割，自那日起，在明日香身边，那个怯懦的真嗣便难觅踪影。他变得更为自信坚定，面对这位德国少女的言语挑衅，不再退缩，甚至能以犀利言辞回击。这些争执在某种奇异的方式下，反倒拉近了两人的距离，最终让他们开始渴望彼此的陪伴。真嗣从沉思中回过神来，继续手头的任务。他缓缓抱起似乎轻若无物的明日香，走向她的房间。轻柔地将她安置于床上，细心地为她盖好被子，宛如对待自己的孩子。他轻触她的额头，轻声道了句晚安。

_Impenetrable wall of Jericho my ass!_ Shinji laughed to himself as he shut off the lights to her room and let her sleep.  
耶利哥城墙坚不可摧？真可笑！碇真嗣暗自笑着，关掉了她房间的灯，让她安然入睡。

He stepped out into the living room and checked on his sister who was now snoring rather loudly, and mumbling some incoherent babble in her sleep. Shinji just gave a frustrated grunt as he adjusted his sisters sleeping position because she was about two inches away from falling off of the couch. Rei was easy to move because she was also very light. Shinji went to go finish up closing down the house when he heard a sound from Rei  
他走进客厅，查看起正大声打鼾、睡梦中含糊不清地嘟囔着的妹妹。真嗣无奈地哼了一声，调整了她的睡姿，因为她离从沙发上掉下来只差两英寸。由于绫波也很轻，移动她并不费力。真嗣正要去关好屋子，却突然听到了绫波那边传来的声响。

"Hmmmmm…. Red is so my favorite color" She muttered in her sleep. Shinji had to do everything he could to keep himself from rolling on the floor in laughter.  
"嗯……红色真是我最喜欢的颜色"，她睡梦中喃喃自语。真嗣不得不竭尽全力控制自己，以免笑得在地上打滚。

He went to the front door to shut off the lights to the living room when a sound caught his ears. He went to the window and saw a very familiar flawless figure approach the door.  
他走到前门，准备关掉客厅的灯，这时一阵声响引起了他的注意。他走向窗户，看到一个非常熟悉、完美无瑕的身影正朝门口走来。

"Late as usual" he grumbled as he prepared to let Misato into the apartment. "She says a few minutes and it turns into 30" He smiled lightly as Misato approached the door.  
“又迟到了。”他一边嘟囔着，一边准备让美里进公寓。“她说几分钟，结果变成了 30 分钟。”当美里走近门时，他微微一笑。

"Late again Misato" Shinji quipped.  
"又迟到了，美里小姐。" 真嗣打趣道。

"…." Misato gave no answer  
……" 碇真嗣没有回答

"Come on in then, let's get you to sleep you've got an early day tomorrow" Shinji chided as he grabbed her right hand and began to lead Misato in but she remained on the outside of the door.  
“那就进来吧，早点睡，你明天还要早起呢。”真嗣一边责备着，一边抓住她的右手，试图领着美里进门，但她仍站在门外不肯进来。

"Come on Misato this isn't funny" Shinji said now getting more serious. She gave no reply  
"拜托了，美里小姐，这不好笑。" 碇真嗣说着，语气变得更加严肃。她没有回应。

"M-Misato what's wrong you're starting to scare me" Shinji said "ANSWER ME!" He said now in an extremely worried tone.  
"美里小姐，你怎么了？你开始吓到我了。" 真嗣说道，"回答我！" 他现在用一种极度担忧的语气说。

"There's no need to zhout" A German accent answered standing close to Misato.  
"没必要这么紧张。" 一个带着德国口音的声音在美里身边响起。

"W-Who the hell are you?" Shinji asked the voice with his own quaking with fear.  
"你他妈到底是谁？" 真嗣颤抖着声音问道，自己的声音中也充满了恐惧。

"You muzt be Zhinji" The voice answered as a set golden eyes pierced the shadows behind the entranced Misato. The rest of his form remained obscure to Shinji's view.  
"你一定是真嗣。" 一个声音回答道，一双金色的眼睛穿透了迷住美里身后的阴影。他的其余身形在真嗣的视线中依旧模糊不清。

"Mine name iz Tazhigi… Tazhigi Heinrich Soryu" he said slowly  
“我的名字是塔吉吉……塔吉吉·海因里希·索龙”他缓缓说道

"I am Asuka's older brozer, it's a pleazure to meet zyou Zhinji Ikari, ze famous zird child"  
我是明日香的哥哥，很荣幸见到你，碇真嗣，著名的使徒之子

Shinji could only stare in shock at what the voice had just claimed.  
真嗣只能震惊地盯着声音刚刚宣称的内容。

**To be continued…. 未完待续….**

## Chapter 2: Test Anxiety  
第二章：考试焦虑  

TASHIGI: 达斯琪：

_**CHAPTER 2: Test Anxiety 第二章：考试焦虑**_

**Disclaimer: I do not own Neon Genesis: Evangelion. Hideaki Anno does, but if I did the series would've ended a lot less dark.  
声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。这是庵野秀明的作品，但如果是我，结局可能不会那么暗黑。**

**RECAP: "Mine name iz Tazhigi… Tazhigi Heinrich Soryu" he said slowly  
回顾："我的名字是塔兹吉…塔兹吉·海因里希·索鲁"他缓缓地说道**

"**I am Asuka's older brother, it's a pleazure to meet zyou Zhinji Ikari, ze famous zird child"**  
"我是明日香的哥哥，很荣幸见到你，真嗣·碇，著名的第二适格者"

**Shinji could only stare in shock at what the voice had just claimed  
真嗣只能震惊地盯着声音刚刚宣称的内容****.**

"Y-You're w-who?" Shinji stammered, as his mouth ran dry  
你、你是谁？" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，他的嘴巴干得说不出话来

Tashigi gave no response and kept his gaze on Shinji, trying his best to work the same spell he cast on Misato. At first it didn't work, but Tashigi continued his efforts. He attempted to focus harder but it was still to no avail, as Shinji's defenses were stronger than he had anticipated. Tashigi began to scrunch his brow further, hoping that the increased pressure on his eyes would allow him to penetrate into Shinji's mind. This time was a success, as he broke through the boy's AT Field. Unfortunately he entered into one of the most unlikely of places.  
达吉没有回应，继续盯着真嗣，尽力施展他曾对美里施放的咒语。起初没有效果，但达吉没有放弃，继续努力。他试图更加集中精神，但仍然无济于事，因为真嗣的防御比他预想的要强。达吉开始更加皱紧眉头，希望通过增加眼部的压力来穿透真嗣的心灵。这一次他成功了，突破了男孩的 AT 力场。不幸的是，他进入了一个最不可能的地方。

_What's this?_ Tashigi wondered as he glanced around and saw a dark, empty void surrounding him. A very loud clap of thunder resonated through the darkness as Tashigi dodged a bolt of lightning that struck near where he had stood  
这是什么？塔希吉疑惑地环顾四周，发现自己被一片黑暗空洞所包围。一声巨响的雷鸣在黑暗中回荡，塔希吉躲开了一道闪电，那闪电正好击中了他刚才站立的地方。

_This can't be his mind, it has to be something else.,_ he thought as he evaded yet another bolt from its unknown source. The sheer power coursing through the bolts were enough to rattle Tashigi's calm and confident nature.  
这不可能是他的意识，一定是别的什么。他一边想，一边躲避着来自未知源头的又一闪电。闪电中蕴含的强大力量足以动摇塔希吉平静而自信的本性。

_What's going on here?,_ he wondered as he searched for a clue as to where he was. _Such a powerful defense_, he thought as he moved further into the void.  
这里到底发生了什么？他一边寻找线索，一边疑惑自己身处何方。如此强大的防御，他一边想，一边继续深入这片虚空。

Suddenly a harsh chill gusted through the darkness, encircling Tashigi. His eyes were drawn to the source as he moved quickly to his left, away from the onslaught of another lightning bolt. The icy breeze intensified as Tashigi drew closer to the source, causing him to shiver slightly. Though he was able to push through, anyone of lesser mental fortitude would've succumbed to the chill's heart-freezing ferocity. Tashigi pressed on, despite the pressure it put on his being.  
突然，一阵刺骨的寒风穿透黑暗，围绕着塔希吉。他的目光被吸引向源头，同时迅速向左移动，避开另一道闪电的袭击。随着塔希吉接近源头，冰冷的气流愈发强烈，使他不禁微微颤抖。尽管他能够坚持下去，但任何意志稍弱的人都会被这股寒意的心脏冻结之力所征服。塔希吉不顾压力，继续前进。

As he drew closer to the epicenter of the chill, another loud clap was heard along with two parallel bolts of lightning. Tashigi attempted to shield himself, throwing his left arm in front of his face and averting his eyes. When he glanced back to where the two bolts hits he gasped in surprise.  
当他接近寒意的中心时，又一声巨响伴随着两道平行的闪电响起。塔希吉试图保护自己，用左臂挡在脸前，避开视线。当他回头看向两道闪电击中的地方时，他惊讶地倒吸一口凉气。

_Ach What now?,_ he wondered as 2 human figures appeared before him.  
啊，又怎么了？他心中疑惑，眼前突然出现了两个人影。

It was difficult, but Tashigi could now make out two black and white figures. One was a seemingly small child in tears, while the other was a full grown man, walking away from young one. Upon closer inspection it appeared that Shinji had taken the role of the little boy. However, it was harder to make out who the taller figure was. The taller figure began to fade into the shadows as the cries from the younger boy grew louder, but still unheard.  
虽然困难，但达斯琪现在能分辨出两个黑白身影。一个是看似小孩的哭泣身影，另一个是成年男子，正从孩子身边走开。仔细一看，发现真嗣扮演了小男孩的角色。然而，较难辨认的是那个较高的身影是谁。随着小男孩的哭声越来越大，却依旧无人听见，那个较高的身影开始逐渐消失在阴影中。

The next turn of events threw Tashigi for a loop. He watched as the younger boy began to grow rapidly into a teenager, and continued to look on towards the disappearing figure. What happened next began to disturb Tashigi greatly. The teen began to shout.  
接下来的发展让达斯琪大吃一惊。他看到那个小男孩迅速成长为一名青少年，并继续望向那逐渐消失的身影。接下来发生的事情开始让达斯琪感到极度不安。那个青少年开始大声呼喊。

"**FATHER! FATHER! Don't you want me? Can't you face me?" ,** the teenager screamed into the darkness with no response. He continued to scream into the void as his voice began to echo off the walls of the chamber.  
“父亲！父亲！你不要我了吗？你不敢面对我吗？”青少年对着黑暗尖叫，没有任何回应。他继续对着虚空尖叫，声音开始在密室的墙壁间回响。

Tashigi now knew exactly where he was. He hadn't been transported to Shinji's mind, but his soul instead. Immediately he began to weaken the stare he had on Shinji, trying his best to get out of the darkness that was beginning to affect his own psyche. All around him the air became very thick, and began to reek of blood. Tashigi began to retch and found it very hard to get any air into his lungs. He felt as if his mind was being ripped to shreds by the horrors that began to surround him. Specters of the 17 angels that were destroyed began to appear all around the confines of Shinji's soul. One figure appeared as boy with red eyes and white skin, before melting into a pool of LCL. Tashigi let out a violent scream as he continued his efforts to pull himself back to his own body.  
此刻，达西吉确切地知道了自己的所在。他并未被传送至真嗣的意识中，而是进入了他的灵魂。他立刻开始减弱对真嗣的凝视，竭尽全力试图摆脱开始影响自己心智的黑暗。四周的空气变得异常浓稠，并开始弥漫着血腥味。达西吉开始干呕，发现很难吸入任何空气。他感觉自己的心智仿佛被周围涌现的恐怖景象撕裂。17 个被摧毁的天使的幽灵开始在真嗣灵魂的范围内显现。一个身影出现，是一个红眼白肤的男孩，随后融化成一滩 LCL。达西吉发出一声剧烈的尖叫，继续努力将自己拉回自己的身体。

After a great struggle, Tashigi barely managed to wrench himself from the confines of Shinji's soul. The "adventure" had taken its toll on him, as he huffed deeply at what he'd just seen. It was by far the most unsettling thing he'd ever witnessed and never wanted to again.  
经过一番艰苦挣扎，达西吉勉强从真嗣灵魂的束缚中挣脱出来。这次“冒险”让他付出了巨大的代价，他深深地喘息着，回想起刚才所见的一切。那无疑是他所见过的最令人不安的景象，他再也不愿经历第二次。

Without a sound he began to walk away from the door. Releasing his grip on Misato and causing her to faint into Shinji's arms. Slowly Shinji laid Misato down on the floor and then went to chase after Tashigi.  
他无声地开始远离门口。松开对美里紧握的手，使她昏倒在真嗣的怀里。真嗣缓缓地将美里放在地板上，然后去追赶塔希吉。

"Hey where do you think you're going? Get back here! I demand an explanation for this!" Shinji barked at Tashigi's quickly fading silhouette. Tashigi gave no reply, as the boy's screams rang in his ears.  
“嘿，你想去哪儿？回来！我要求对此有个解释！”真嗣对着塔希吉迅速消失的背影吼道。塔希吉没有回应，男孩的尖叫声在他耳边回响。

"Didn't you hear what I said! Stop! You can't just show up here, make an outrageous claim, and then leave without saying anything. Just who do you think you are? ANSWER ME!" Shinji screamed, piercing the night time air. He'd surely awoken a few neighbors, if not cats and dogs with the powerful shrieks from his voice.  
“你没听见我说的话吗！停下！你不能就这样出现，提出一个荒谬的说法，然后什么都不说就离开。你以为你是谁？回答我！”真嗣尖叫着，划破了夜空。他的声音肯定惊醒了几位邻居，如果不是猫狗的话，也足以用那强大的尖叫声。

"I told you vonce already" Tashigi finally replied, not turning to face Shinji, nor stopping to give his answer. "I am Tazhigi Heinrich Zoryu. Asuka's older brozer. " With that he gave no new information and with a slightly menacing smirk left the apartment complex.  
"我已经告诉过你一次了"，达吉吉终于回答道，没有转头面对真嗣，也没有停下来给出答案。"我是达吉吉·海因里希·索尤。明日香的大哥。"说完这些，他没有提供新的信息，带着一丝威胁性的冷笑离开了公寓楼。

Shinji stood paralyzed, in a mix of rage and fear at what had just transpired. He would've stayed that way all night had he not remembered he had two… well now three women to deal with the following morning. Sighing deeply, and getting his emotions under control, Shinji strolled back to his apartment to get to sleep. He knew he'd need it for the next morning.  
真嗣僵立在原地，对刚刚发生的事情既愤怒又害怕。如果不是想起第二天早上他还有两个……现在应该是三个女人要处理，他可能会那样站一整夜。他深深叹了口气，控制住自己的情绪，漫步回到自己的公寓准备睡觉。他知道第二天早上他需要精力。

Meanwhile, at the foot of the complex, Tashigi's eyes wandered one more time to Misato's apartment.  
与此同时，在公寓楼的脚下，达吉吉的目光再次游移到了美里小姐的公寓。

"I'll zee you again zoon Zhinji, much zooner zen you zink", Tashigi chuckled to himself as he disappeared into the shadows of the night.  
"我很快就会再见到你，甚平，比你想象的还要快。" 塔希吉轻笑一声，随即消失在夜色之中。

**The Next Morning: 次日清晨：**

"Ugh!" Rei grunted as she was the first to arise from her drunken stupor the night before.  
"呃！" 丽第一个从昨晚的醉意中醒来，发出一声闷哼。

"Hey Sis!", Shinji greeted his little sister wrapping her in a light hug.  
"嘿，妹妹！" 真嗣向他的妹妹打招呼，轻轻地拥抱了她一下。

"Ouch hey, look out brother I'm still hurting from last night!", Rei answered, responding to the hug.  
"哎哟，小心点，哥哥，我昨晚的伤还没好呢！" 绫波回应着拥抱，说道。

"Oh s-sorry!", Shinji responded, as he returned to his cooking for the three women.  
"哦，对不起！" 真嗣回答道，然后继续为三位女士准备饭菜。

It was Saturday, so Shinji knew he didn't have to wake Asuka up for school. He decided to let her sleep in for as long as she wanted. However, as the aroma of breakfast wafted its way through the house, it didn't take much to wake the other two up from their slumber.  
那天是周六，所以真嗣知道不需要叫明日香起床去上学。他决定让她睡到自然醒。然而，随着早餐的香味弥漫整个屋子，另外两人很快就被这香气唤醒了。

"Pancakes?", Asuka asked out loud as she awoke and drifted into the kitchen  
“是煎饼吗？”明日香醒来后，一边问着一边走进厨房。

"BACON & BEER!" Misato screamed, as she bounded into the kitchen, trampling poor Asuka in the process.  
“培根和啤酒！”美里大喊着冲进厨房，过程中不小心踩到了可怜的明日香。

"Good…morning….to you too…Misato.", Asuka mumbled with a hint of annoyance as she pulled herself up.  
"早上好…你也一样…葛城小姐。" 明日香带着一丝不悦嘟囔着，挣扎着坐起身来。

Misato had already piled on a quarter pound of bacon onto her plate and was guzzling down her first can of beer  
葛城已经往自己盘子里堆了四分之一磅的培根，并且正在大口灌下她的第一罐啤酒

"WOOHOO! The breakfast of champions!", Misato declared with a piece of bacon swinging from her mouth.  
"哇哦！这才是冠军的早餐！"，葛城嘴里叼着一片培根，大声宣布道。

_I've seen Pen Pen with better table manners…,_ Shinji thought with a sigh.  
"我见过 Pen Pen 吃饭都比这有礼貌……" 真嗣叹了口气，心想。

Misato continued to devour the crisped meat like a starving dog, as Rei watched in disbelief.  
美里继续像饿狗一样狼吞虎咽地吃着烤肉，丽在一旁看得目瞪口呆。

She turned to Asuka, who had just sat next to her, and whispered, "Does the Major always eat with such enthusiasm?"  
她转向刚坐到旁边的明日香，低声问道："少校平时吃饭都是这么豪放吗？"

Asuka looked up from her specially made, Belgian pancakes and replied, "You should see her go to town with a steak. Any cows left in the world would be seeking sanctuary in India!"  
明日香从她特制的比利时松饼上抬起头来，回答道：“你真该看看她吃牛排的样子。世界上要是还有牛，估计都得逃到印度去寻求庇护了！”

"Are we discussing a certain someone's eating habits? Huh ladies?", Misato asked as bacon bits spewed from her mouth. After the assault from the flying shards of half-chewed bits of meat, Misato took another huge swig of beer, prompting her to release a rather loud belch that shook the entire table.  
“我们是在讨论某人的饮食习惯吗？嗯，女士们？” 美里边说边从嘴里喷出培根碎屑。在遭受了飞溅的半嚼碎肉片的袭击后，美里又猛灌了一大口啤酒，随即发出一声震动了整个桌子的响亮饱嗝。

The two female pilots just stared at Misato's grotesque display of table manners.  
两位女驾驶员只是目瞪口呆地看着美里那令人瞠目结舌的餐桌礼仪。

"If this is how the Major thinks we should eat…", Rei began as she piled a half foot stack of bacon onto her plate.  
"如果这是少校认为我们应该吃的方式……"，绫波开始说着，将半英尺高的培根堆叠在自己的盘子上。

"Rei….um, I wouldn't….", Shinji tried to warn his sister, but to no avail.  
"绫波……呃，我不会……"，真嗣试图警告他的妹妹，但无济于事。

Rei had become a mirror image of Misato as bacon was sent flying everywhere. The munching and gulping seemed to resonate throughout the whole kitchen.  
绫波已经变成了另一个美里，培根四处飞溅。咀嚼和吞咽的声音似乎在整个厨房回响。

Asuka looked on in disgust before saying, "You know, I think I'll just go eat in my room."  
明日香厌恶地看着，然后说道：“你知道吗，我想我还是回房间吃吧。”

As she made her way toward her room with her plate, she thought to herself, _Where did we get all of this bacon from anyway…_  
她端着盘子走向房间，心里想着，我们到底是从哪儿弄来这么多培根的……

Asuka made her way into her room and sat down on her bed. It didn't take too long to hear some shouting for Shinji to hurry up with the next batch of bacon, then Shinji apologizing for being so slow, and finally Misato teasing him after guzzling down yet another beer.  
明日香走进房间，坐在床上。不久就听到有人喊着让真嗣快点准备下一波培根，接着是真嗣为动作慢而道歉，最后是美里喝完又一罐啤酒后调侃他。

"Honestly sometimes I think I live in a house full of pigs" Asuka mumbled to herself, as she popped a piece of her pancakes in her mouth. She was surprised at the great taste. _Well, at least the baka's good at something.,_ she thought  
"老实说，有时候我觉得自己住在一群猪的家里。" 明日香自言自语道，同时将一块煎饼送入口中。她惊讶于这美妙的味道。好吧，至少那个笨蛋在某些方面还是挺擅长的。_._

"Well, I'll be honest. He's better at a lot more than just cooking" Asuka sighed, as she sub-consciously slid her fingers over lightly over her lips.  
"好吧，说实话。他在很多方面都比做饭更擅长。" 明日香叹了口气，下意识地用手指轻轻滑过自己的嘴唇。

_Mein GOTT! Did I just say that_ Asuka mentally slapped herself _Gott in himel what's wrong with me lately all I can think about is…_  
我的天啊！我刚才是说了什么吗？明日香在心里给了自己一巴掌。天哪，我最近是怎么了，满脑子想的都是……

"Hey Asuka!", Shinji called, right outside of Asuka's door  
“嘿，明日香！”，真嗣在明日香的门外喊道。

"WHAT?", she shrieked, startled by his voice.  
“什么？！”，她尖叫道，被他的声音吓了一跳。

For some reason, as the months wore on after her attack from the fifteenth Angel, Asuka had found herself incapable of feeling hatred for Shinji. Even though she'd said that still hated him, she still found herself more drawn to him than before.  
不知为何，自从被第十五使徒袭击后的几个月里，明日香发现自己无法对真嗣产生恨意。尽管她曾说过仍然恨他，但她发现自己比以往更加被他吸引。

It started out rather innocently at first. She began standing in the kitchen and peering over his shoulder while he was cooking, admiring his improved culinary skill. Strangely enough, from that point on it seemed that the food Shinji cooked had a richer and more robust taste than before.  
起初，一切显得相当单纯。她开始站在厨房里，越过他的肩膀窥视，欣赏他日益精进的烹饪技艺。说来奇怪，从那时起，真嗣做的饭菜似乎比以前更加浓郁美味了。

Then Asuka gradually progressed to the point where she would be hanging around him during other activities as well. During his cello playing, Shinji now always had a somewhat captivated in Asuka, who gave him a rousing applause every time he finished. This made him turn around and blush before he proceeded to another song. Strangely enough Shinji's skill seemed to improve even more when Asuka was there to watch. Shinji could even play the most complicated pieces, not only perfectly, but also with ease when she was near. Needless to say, something about Asuka made Shinji discover hidden talents he never dreamt possible when he was growing up alone.  
随后，明日香逐渐发展到在其他活动中也围绕在他身边。每当真嗣拉大提琴时，他总能感受到明日香那略带迷醉的目光，每次他演奏完毕，她都会热烈鼓掌。这让他转过身来，脸颊泛红，然后继续下一首曲子。奇怪的是，有明日香在场观看时，真嗣的技艺似乎更加精进。他甚至能轻松自如地演奏最复杂的曲目，不仅完美无瑕，而且当她在附近时，一切都显得那么自然。不用说，明日香让真嗣发现了自己成长过程中从未梦想过的隐藏才能。

"Umm… Earth to Asuka? Asuka you still there?" Shinji asked, still behind her bedroom door.  
“呃……明日香，你在听吗？明日香，你还在吗？”真嗣隔着她的卧室门问道。

"Y-Yes… Yeah I'm still here what do you want dumkopf?" Asuka asked, still shaken to a degree.  
"是…是的，我还在这儿，你想要什么，笨蛋？" 明日香问道，声音仍有些颤抖。

"There's a waffle out here if you want it. I made one for Rei and Misato already" Shinji explained.  
"外面有华夫饼，如果你想要的话。我已经给绫波和美里做了一份" 真嗣解释道。

"That sounds great. I'll be out in a minute or two!", Asuka replied with a little more composure in her voice.  
"听起来不错。我一会儿就出来！"，明日香回答时，声音中多了几分镇定。

As Shinji's footsteps drew away from the door, Asuka could not help but notice how fast her heart was racing. A soft smile appeared on her face before being replaced by her usual, more stern facade.  
随着真嗣的脚步声渐渐远离门口，明日香不禁注意到自己的心跳得有多快。她脸上浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑，随即又被她平日里更为严肃的面具所取代。

"Hmph! The nerve of that idiot, surprising me like that!", she said as she walked out of her room.  
"哼！那个笨蛋，居然这样吓我一跳！"，她说着走出了自己的房间。

Asuka walked through the living room and saw Misato now laying on the couch. Bacon bits could be seen strewn around her on the floor.  
明日香穿过客厅，看到美里现在正躺在沙发上。地板上散落着一些培根碎片。

"Oooooh….bacon…..", Misato groaned as she placed her face in the couch cushion.  
"哦哦哦……培根……"，惣流·明日香·兰格雷呻吟着，将脸埋进沙发垫里。

Rei on the other hand was still sitting at the table, wiping her mouth delicately with a napkin.  
而绫波则是依旧坐在桌旁，优雅地用餐巾擦拭着嘴角。

"Hmm..", Asuka said as she sat down next to the 1st Child. "Looks like you couldn't keep up with Misato's pace, could you Rei?", Asuka said in a teasing manner.  
"嗯……"，明日香说着，坐到了第一适格者旁边。"看来你跟不上惣流的节奏啊，绫波？"，明日香带着戏谑的口吻说道。

"Actually, I consumed twice as much bacon as Misato did.", Rei said calmly as she cleaned her place at the table.  
"实际上，我吃的培根是碇真嗣的两倍。" 绫波丽平静地说着，同时清理着自己桌前的位置。

"WHAT?", Asuka exclaimed with a look of disbelief on her face. "Then…then how come your not sick?"  
"什么？" 明日香惊呼道，脸上写满了难以置信。"那……那你怎么没生病？"

"Pacing and a lot of water. I saw it on a television show from the Pre- second impact era." Rei explained as she deposited her dish by Shinji, who was now at the sink, before walking into the living room  
"多走动，多喝水。我是在第二次冲击前的一个电视节目里看到的。" 绫波解释着，将自己的餐具放在正在水槽边的真嗣旁边，然后走进了客厅。

Unbeknownst to the other two Eva pilots, Shinji was preoccupied with something more important than washing the dishes. As he continued to scrub and rinse the plates and silverware in a robot-like manner, Shinji greater concentration was elsewhere.  
另外两位 Eva 驾驶员并不知道，真嗣此刻的心思远比洗碗来得重要。他机械般地继续刷洗着盘子和餐具，但他的大部分注意力却已飘向别处。

_Who was he really?_, Shinji thought to himself as he recalled the events from the previous night.  
他究竟是谁？真嗣一边洗着碗，一边回想起前一晚发生的事情，心中暗自思索。

A pair of golden eyes seemed to appear on the plate that Shinji was rinsing, as if responding to this thought.  
就在这时，真嗣正在冲洗的盘子上仿佛浮现出一双金色的眼睛，似乎在回应着他的思绪。

"AHH!", Shinji shouted as he dropped the plate on the floor, shattering it into multiple fragments.  
“啊！” 真嗣大叫一声，手中的盘子掉落在地，摔成了碎片。

He immediately fell to the floor and began to clean up the mess he had made, his face turning various shades of red.  
他立刻蹲下身开始清理自己造成的混乱，脸颊涨得通红。

Asuka just rolled her eyes and gave a small smirk to the frazzled boy.  
明日香只是翻了个白眼，对着慌张的男孩微微一笑。

"Scared of your own reflection dumkopf?", she chided to him. "You really are hopeless at times.", Asuka finished as she returned to her waffle.  
"怕自己的倒影，笨蛋吗？"，她责备他道。"你有时候真是无可救药。"，明日香说完便继续吃她的华夫饼。

Shinji continued to clean up the mess the broken plate had made, but still couldn't get the vision of those eyes out of his mind.  
真嗣继续清理碎盘子造成的混乱，但仍然无法将那双眼睛的影像从脑海中抹去。

_What if he was_…, Shinji thought before turning to Asuka, who was just finishing her breakfast.  
如果他是……，真嗣想着，转向了刚刚吃完早餐的明日香。

"Umm, hey Asuka…", Shinji said with a cautious voice.  
"嗯，那个，明日香…"，真嗣小心翼翼地说道。

"If you expect me to come down and help clean up your mess Shinji, you can forget about it.", Asuka replied as she went to place her dish by the sink.  
"如果你指望我下来帮你收拾烂摊子，真嗣，那你还是别想了。"，明日香一边说着，一边走向水槽旁放下了她的盘子。

"Oh, its not that. I was just wondering whether you had any relatives here in Japan?", Shinji continued with a cautious manner. "I mean, has anyone come to visit you lately?"  
"哦，不是那个意思。我只是想知道你在日本有没有亲戚？"，真嗣继续小心翼翼地问道，"我的意思是，最近有人来探望过你吗？"

Asuka cocked an eye brow at the raven-haired boy and gave a perplexed look.  
明日香挑起一边眉毛，困惑地看向那个黑发少年。

"What in EVA's name are you talking about, Third Child?", Asuka responded.  
“你到底在说什么啊，第三适格者？”明日香回应道。

"Well…" Shinji began “嗯……”真嗣开始说道

"Look dumkopf I'm trying to eat. If you want to know something let me know now", Asuka responded.  
"看你这傻瓜，我正吃饭呢。你要想知道什么就现在说", 明日香回应道。

"uhh… …" ,Shinji stuttered, unable to find the right words explaining last nights events.  
"呃… …"，真嗣结巴着，找不到合适的词来解释昨晚发生的事情。

He didn't want to freak Asuka out about what happened. However, he couldn't simply just let it go he had to find the truth.  
他不想让明日香因为昨晚的事感到恐慌。然而，他也不能就这样不了了之，他必须找出真相。

"WHAT?", Asuka shot her head up now giving Shinji the glare that he'd come all to well to recognize.  
"什么？" 明日香猛地抬起头，用一种真嗣已经非常熟悉的瞪视盯着他。

"Uh…", Shinji squeaked in fear of the impeding pounding that was about to commence if he continued on his current path.  
"呃…" 真嗣因为即将到来的打击而害怕地尖叫，如果他继续沿着当前的路走下去，打击即将来临。

"Excuse me?" Rei interrupted in a quite voice,  
"打扰一下？" 绫波用相当轻的声音打断道，

"Oh great now Wondergirl wants to get in on the act.", Asuka sighed in annoyance, "What is it?", she asked hastily, wanting to get back to the imminent restructuring of Shinji's face.  
"哦，现在连 Wondergirl 也想插一脚了。" 明日香不耐烦地叹了口气，"什么事？" 她急切地问道，一心想快点回去继续重塑真嗣的脸。

"Sorry to interrupt but didn't we have our monthly sync and harmonics tests today?" Rei asked  
"抱歉打断一下，但我们今天不是有每月的同步和谐波测试吗？" 绫波问道

As soon as Misato heard Rei's question, her eyes fired open and she catapulted off the couch and into the kitchen.  
一听到绫波的问题，美里立刻睁大了眼睛，从沙发上一跃而起，冲进了厨房。

"NO MORE BACON! We're gonna be late!" Misato screamed as she bolted for her bedroom to grab a clean towel.  
"别再吃培根了！我们要迟到了！" 明日香尖叫着冲向卧室去拿一条干净的毛巾。

"Oh crap!", Asuka shouted as she made a mad dash for her room, nearly tripping over Shinji, who was still on the floor.  
"糟糕！" 明日香大喊一声，疯狂地冲向自己的房间，差点绊倒在还躺在地上的真嗣身上。

Rei followed in suit, making a b-line straight for the bathroom.  
绫波也紧随其后，直奔浴室而去。

"Oh no you don't Wondergirl!", Asuka shouted as she raced to the door, with her towel barely covering her nude body.  
"哦不，你别想逃，神奇女孩！" 明日香喊着冲向门口，身上的毛巾勉强遮住她裸露的身体。

"But I must cleanse myself before going to work. Body soil in the plug suit can disrupt a synch test…", Rei explained calmly as she disrobed in the doorway.  
"但我必须在工作前清洗自己。插入栓服内的身体污垢可能会干扰同步测试…"，绫波平静地解释着，在门口脱下了衣服。

"Sorry girls, but I outrank both of you and its my shower!", Misato announced as she too claimed access to the bathroom.  
"抱歉了姑娘们，但我比你们都高一级，这浴室我先用！"，美里宣布道，她也加入了争夺浴室的行列。

(Also, only in a towel…)  
(还有，只裹着一条毛巾…)

"We're not at NERV yet Misato! You can't pull rank on us here!", Asuka shouted as she attempted to move in front of Rei.  
“我们还没到 NERV 呢，葛城小姐！在这里你不能对我们发号施令！”明日香一边喊着，一边试图挤到绫波前面。

"Excuse me!", Misato retorted as she attempted to move into the bathroom behind Rei. "I _am_ your guardian and still hold rank outside of NERV, Pilot Soryu!"  
“不好意思！”葛城反驳道，同时试图挤进绫波身后的浴室。“我是你们的监护人，即使在 NERV 之外，我仍然有职权，惣流·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员！”

Shinji could not believe his eyes. Two partially nude women were sandwiching one fully nude women in the doorway to bathroom. Watching Asuka and Misato attempt to _rub_ past Rei was more than enough for his body to blush all over.  
真嗣简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。两位半裸的女性正夹着一位全裸的女性在浴室门口。看着明日香和美里试图从零身边蹭过去，他的身体不由自主地泛起了红晕。

"…", Shinji stared in silence, with no words for what he was seeing.  
"……"，真嗣沉默地凝视着，对于眼前的一幕无言以对。

Asuka was the first to notice their audience and shouted, "Scheise!", as she pitched a random bar of soap at Shinji's head. This caused him to promptly fall back onto the floor, as the women continued to fight for dominance of the bathroom.  
明日香最先注意到旁观者，她大喊一声“Scheise!”，随即抓起一块肥皂朝真嗣的脑袋扔去。这一下让他立刻跌坐在地，而女人们则继续争夺浴室的控制权。

"Women…", Shinji sighed under his breath.  
"女人…", 真嗣低声叹息道。

**NERV Headquarters: NERV 总部：**

It was amazing that the pilots were able to get to NERV in one piece, since Misato had taken the wheel to drive to their destination.  
令人惊讶的是，驾驶员们竟然能完好无损地抵达 NERV，毕竟是由美里负责驾驶前往目的地的。

"Honestly Asuka, I think you're overreacting a bit!", Shinji said through his side of the locker room, as the three pilots began to change into their plug suits for the days test.  
"老实说，明日香，我觉得你有点反应过度了！" 真嗣在更衣室的一侧说道，此时三位驾驶员正开始换上他们为当天测试准备的插入栓服。

"No I'm not. You were peeking at all three of us, standing there in nothing but…", Asuka began  
"我没有。你刚才一直在偷看我们三个，就那样站在那里，什么都没穿……" 明日香开始说道

"It's not like I could help it. You were in the doorway for cryin' out loud!", Shinji cut her off, trying to make himself seem somewhat less guilty for the events after breakfast.  
"我也不想这样啊，你站在门口，我还能怎么办！" 真嗣打断她，试图为自己早餐后发生的事情减轻一些罪责感。

_Since when does he not apologize for something like this? Also, how did he come up with a good defense for his actions?_ Asuka pondered as the three suited up for the days tests.  
他什么时候开始不为这种事道歉了？还有，他是怎么想出一套合理的辩解的？明日香一边思索着，一边和另外两人一起准备当天的测试。

Tensions were high. Naturally the regulars would be observing the tests and then reviewing the scores from each individual. It figured to turn out the same, Asuka at number one, barely edging out Shinji at number two, and Rei bringing up the rear at number three. However, the scores of Asuka and Shinji had gotten increasingly closer after the defeat of the Angels.  
气氛紧张。自然，常规成员们会观察测试，然后逐一审查分数。结果不出所料，明日香以微弱优势位居第一，真嗣紧随其后排名第二，零则排在第三。然而，自从击败使徒后，明日香和真嗣的分数越来越接近。

The examiners really didn't know what to make of it but there were rumors going around that Shinji had finally made peace with his father and inner-demons that haunted him during the threat of a Third Impact. After Angel 17 (Code name: Tabris) was defeated things made a dramatic turn.  
考官们对此也摸不着头脑，但有传言说，真嗣终于与他的父亲以及内心的恶魔和解了，这些恶魔曾在第三次冲击的威胁下困扰着他。在击败第 17 使徒（代号：塔布里斯）后，情况发生了戏剧性的转变。

Shinji seemed more relaxed, and even happy during his "time-off." He began to freely express exactly what he was feeling inside, and wore more readable looks on his face. When he was angry, he visibly fumed, when he was happy, he smiled; though basic in nature it made a remarkable impact on his scores of his sync tests. He jumped first from 56 to 70 percent, then from 70 to 80 percent, and finally up to Asuka's range at 90 percent. When asked, Shinji would answer that he didn't know why his scores had jumped up so drastically, it just happened. However, that's when the rumors started going around, which Shinji took in stride and continued to use towards bettering his scores.  
真嗣似乎更加放松了，甚至在休息时间里显得很开心。他开始自由地表达内心的感受，脸上的表情也更加易于解读。当他生气时，明显会怒气冲冲；当他高兴时，则会露出笑容；虽然这些表现很基本，却对他的同步测试成绩产生了显著的影响。他的成绩先是跃升至 70%，然后从 70%提升到 80%，最终达到了明日香的水平，达到 90%。当被问及时，真嗣会回答说他不知道为什么成绩会如此大幅度提升，只是自然而然就发生了。然而，这正是流言开始传播的时候，真嗣从容应对，并继续利用这些流言来提高自己的成绩。

Today though, was Shinji's chance to show his worth. He'd heard from Dr. Akagi, who at the time was having a conversation with Misato, that his father would be observing today's sync and harmonics tests. To make things even more interesting, Gendo would be the evaluator of the exams and, not only evaluate where the pilots stood on each, but also offer advice on how to improve further with their training.  
然而今天，是真嗣展示自己价值的机会。他从赤木博士那里得知，当时赤木博士正与美里交谈，他的父亲将会观察今天的同步和和谐测试。更令人感兴趣的是，源堂不仅会评估考试，还会评估每位驾驶员在这些测试中的表现，并提供进一步训练的建议。

It was only natural that Shinji wanted to impress his father, for more than just showing Gendo that he was a good EVA pilot. He also, wanted to prove that, Gendo had made a mistake in disregarding Shinji as a boy.  
新想要给父亲留下深刻印象，这不仅仅是为了向源堂展示他是一个优秀的 EVA 驾驶员。他还想证明，源堂忽视新作为一个孩子的存在是错误的。

"Shinji? Please pay attention!", Ritsuko Akagi scolded the young man over the intercom, arousing him from his thoughts.  
“新？请集中注意力！”赤木律子通过内部通讯严厉地提醒这位年轻人，将他从沉思中唤醒。

"Huh? Oh, what were you saying Ritsuko?, Shinji said with a look of utter confusion on his face.  
“啊？哦，你在说什么，律子？”新脸上带着完全困惑的表情说道。

Ritsuko gave an aggravated sigh before replying, "The tests are over. Unless you would like to be alone in the plug overnight, I'd suggest getting out."  
律子不耐烦地叹了口气，然后回答道：“测试结束了。除非你想在插入栓里过夜，否则我建议你出来。”

"Oh, uh right!", Shinji replied with a red face, before finally climbing out of the plug.  
“哦，呃，对！” 真嗣红着脸回答，然后终于从插入栓里爬了出来。

As he reached the catwalk that ran adjacent to Unit-01, Shinji noticed Rei, Asuka, and Misato standing toward the end of the cage.  
当他走到与初号机相邻的步道上时，真嗣注意到绫波、明日香和美里站在笼子的尽头。

"Have a good nap dumpkopf?", Asuka harassed her fellow pilot.  
"睡个好觉，傻瓜？"，明日香调侃着她的同僚驾驶员。

"You seemed very comfortable during the tests today Shinji. More so than you used to be…", Rei observed.  
"你今天在测试中看起来很自在，比以前更甚……"，绫波观察道。

"Should we move all of you things to the cage instead? The plug would make an interesting bedroom.", Misato teased Shinji with a chuckle.  
"要不要把你的东西都搬到插入栓里去？那儿当卧室应该挺有意思的。"，美里带着笑意调侃真嗣。

"Hey, knock it off…", Shinji tried to fired back. "Its not like I was snoring or anything during the tests!"  
"嘿，别闹了…"，真嗣试图反驳道，"我又不是在测试中打呼噜什么的！"

The group began to make its way out of the cage as the technicians moved in to perform their daily maintenance. One of the men, clad in a dark grey jumpsuit, caught Shinji's eye. Two golden eyes peered at Shinji from beneath the technician's hard hat before he joined the others by Unit-01.  
随着技术人员进入进行日常维护，小组开始离开笼子。其中一名身穿深灰色连体工作服的男子吸引了真嗣的注意。那人从安全帽下投来两道金色的目光，随后便加入了围绕零号机的其他人。

"Was that…", Shinji whispered under his breath, while turning to get another glance at the man.  
"那是…"，真嗣低声自语，同时转头再次瞥向那名男子。

"Hey Ikari!", barked the voice of a certain red head from down the hall. "Get your ass in gear! I'm so hungry that even the food served in this place sounds like a gourmet meal!"  
"嘿，碇！"走廊里传来某个红发少年的声音，"快点动起来！我饿得连这里的饭菜听起来都像是美味佳肴了！"

"Coming!", Shinji shouted as he ran to catch up with the others.  
"来了！"真嗣大声回应着，跑去追赶其他人。

It was 2:30 when Shinji and the others reached NERV's cafeteria, which was quite empty after the lunch rush. Misato had gone on to confirm the test results of the day with Ritsuko and the higher ups, leaving the three pilots to have lunch by themselves.  
当真嗣和其他人到达 NERV 的食堂时，已经是 2:30 了，午餐高峰过后这里相当空旷。美里已经去和律子以及高层确认当天的测试结果，留下三位驾驶员自己吃午饭。

_Ugh, if Dr. Akagi thought the coffee was bad here, she must not have had the food._, Shinji thought as he poked what was supposed to be a pork chop with his fork.  
"唉，如果赤木博士觉得这里的咖啡难喝，那她肯定没尝过这里的食物。" 碇真嗣想着，用叉子戳了戳那块本应是猪排的东西。

"I bet he's staring at you Rei!", Shinji heard Asuka whisper in excitement  
"我打赌他肯定在盯着你看，绫波！" 碇真嗣听到明日香兴奋地低声说道。

Shinji looked up and saw the two girls blushing while staring at something behind him. They were actually acting like girls their own age.  
碇真嗣抬头一看，发现两个女孩脸颊绯红，正盯着他身后某处。她们此刻的表现，终于像是她们这个年纪的普通女孩了。

_Unbelievable…_, Shinji thought to himself with a small smile.  
"难以置信…", 真嗣心中暗想，嘴角露出一丝微笑。

Rei's developing personality had brought upon another positive side-effect. She had begun to form a strong relationship with Asuka over the past few months. This had progressed to the point where she had joined Asuka and Hikari on trips to the mall and parties. Of course, the fact that both of his fellow pilots were hyperventilating over what he guessed was another boy was something Shinji was not used to yet.  
绫波的个性逐渐显现，也带来了另一个积极的变化。过去几个月里，她与明日香之间的关系变得非常紧密。这种关系发展到了她开始与明日香和光一起去商场和参加派对的程度。当然，两位同伴因为某个男生而激动不已的情况，真嗣还是不太习惯。

"Who is it this time?", Shinji asked with a sarcastic tone, not bothering to even turn around.  
"这次又是谁啊？", 真嗣带着讽刺的语气问道，连头都懒得回。

"Only the most handsome man I have ever seen.", Rei sighed softly, never taking her eyes off of her _target_.  
"我见过的最英俊的男人。" 绫波轻声叹息，目光始终未从目标身上移开。

"You mean "hot" Rei?", Shinji shot back, not too happy that Asuka had gotten his sister interested in men.  
"你是说'性感'的绫波？" 真嗣反驳道，对明日香让他的妹妹对男人产生兴趣感到不悦。

"Oh quiet Ikari! You know nothing about the matters of love!", Asuka shouted before turning to Rei. "Go on Rei. Go talk to him!", she encouraged to blue haired girl.  
"哦，安静点，碇！你对爱情一无所知！" 明日香喊道，然后转向绫波。"继续，绫波。去和他谈谈！" 她鼓励着蓝发女孩。

"What about you Asuka. I would not want to take that "hunk of hunk of burning love" away from you.", Rei replied calmly.  
"你呢，明日香？我可不想夺走你的那位“热情如火的英俊男子”。"，绫波丽平静地回答道。

"WHAT?!", Shinji and Asuka screamed simultaneously.  
"什么？！"，真嗣和明日香同时尖叫起来。

"I heard it on one of Major Katsuragi's old…records I think she called them.", Rei explained.  
"我是在葛城美里少校的旧...她称之为唱片的那些东西上听到的。"，绫波丽解释道。

"Well…", Asuka began after regaining her composure. "…there is only one real man in my life.", she said while clasping her hands together.  
"嗯……", 明日香恢复镇定后开口道，"……我生命中真正的男人只有一个。", 她说着，双手紧握在一起。

"Shinji?", Rei asked calmly.  
"是真嗣吗？", 绫波平静地问道。

"WHAT?! NO WAY!", Asuka shrieked, while blushing.  
"什么？！不可能！", 明日香尖叫着，脸颊泛起红晕。

Both of the girls then turned to Shinji, who was now spurting milk out of his nose after hearing Rei.  
两个女孩随即转向真嗣，只见他听到绫波的话后，鼻子正喷出牛奶。

"Who could be attracted to _that_?!", Asuka shouted, while still blushing. "Anyway, get moving!", Asuka commanded as she coaxed Rei out of her seat.  
“谁会喜欢那种人啊？！”明日香喊道，脸颊依旧泛红。“不管怎样，快点行动！”明日香命令着，一边催促绫波离开座位。

Shinji had just finished wiping up the milk and now wanted to see who Rei's new interest was. Unfortunately, before he could turn his head…  
真嗣刚擦干净牛奶，现在想看看绫波的新欢是谁。可惜，他还没来得及转头……

"Would Pilot Ikari please report to the Commander's Office. Pilot Ikari…", the P.A. system announced.  
"请飞行员碇真嗣到指挥官办公室报到。飞行员碇真嗣……"，广播系统宣布道。

_Oh great. This can't be good_., Shinj thought with a grimace on his face. He arose from his seat and walked form the cafeteria, knowing that he was bound to be chewed out by his father.  
哦，太好了。这肯定没好事。" 碇真嗣皱着眉头想。他从座位上站起来，离开了食堂，心里清楚自己肯定要被父亲训斥一顿。

**Gendo's office: 碇源堂的办公室：**

"You wanted to see me sir?", Shinji asked the Commander, who was turned toward the wall.  
"您找我吗，先生？"，真嗣向背对着墙的指挥官问道。

"Yes Shinji. Please sit down.", Gendo ordered in a firm voice.  
"是的，真嗣。请坐。"，源堂用坚定的声音命令道。

_Using my first name? Can't be good.,_ Shinji thought with apprehension, as he sat in the chair, directly to the right of Gendo.  
直呼我的名字？这可不是什么好事。，真嗣带着忧虑坐到了源堂右边的椅子上。

"I assume you know why you're here.",Gendo began.  
"我猜你知道你为何来此。" 源渡开口道。

"I do indeed commander, so lets just get on with it", Shinji answered in a detached manner.  
"我的确知道，指挥官，那就直接进入正题吧。" 真嗣以一种超然的口吻回答。

_Well, that was an interesting response.,_ Gendo thought to himself.  
嗯，这回答挺有意思的。" 源渡暗自思忖。

"Then let's begin." Gendo announced as he turned to his son.  
"那么我们开始吧。" 源渡宣布着，转向他的儿子。

"Now Shinji you were made aware that I was evaluating your performance today, correct?", Gendo asked his estranged son.  
"现在，真嗣，你已经知道我今天在评估你的表现，对吧？"，源渡问他的疏远儿子。

"Yes", Shinji responded quietly.  
"是的"，真嗣轻声回答。

"Well, let me ask you Shinji: How do you think you did?" Gendo inquired as he sat to the left of Shinji in his _usual_ pose.  
"那么，让我问问你，真嗣：你觉得你做得怎么样？" 源渡以他惯常的姿势坐在真嗣左边问道。

"I think I did…ok, but let's be honest there's no way I outscored Asuka. She's the best" Shinji replied  
"我觉得……还行吧，但说实话，我不可能比明日香得分高。她是最棒的。" 真嗣回答道

"Well Shinji, let's just say you've come a long way, but there's still much room for improvement" Gendo smirked for a moment.  
"嗯，真嗣，可以说你已经进步了，但还有很多提升的空间。" 源渡短暂地露出了一个微笑。

"Now, according to these reports, you're first few sync tests indicated scores of only up to 56 percent. This was well below a satisfactory score." Gendo explained, in a harsh tone.  
"根据这些报告，你最初几次同步测试的得分仅达到 56%。这远低于满意的标准。" 源渡用严厉的语气解释道。

"I thought 56 percent was good, at least according to Doctor Akagi's…" Shinji tried to retort, but was interrupted by Gendo.  
"我以为 56%已经不错了，至少按照赤木博士的标准……" 真嗣试图反驳，但被源渡打断了。

"NOT BY MY STANDARDS SHINJI! That's a failing percentage and I do not tolerate failure, as you well know.", Gendo exclaimed. After this small outburst, the Commander calmed down a bit and spoke again, "Now, as I was saying, your first attempt at the sync ratio left you at 56 percent. After that you made a significant jump to seventy percent, then to eighty. Finally, according to Doctor Akagi's report from a month ago, you were at 90 percent." Gendo explained, still maintaining an unresponsive expression, while still impressed by Shinji's previous score.  
"真嗣，这在我看来是不及格的！我不容忍失败，这一点你很清楚。" 源渡大声说道。在这短暂的爆发后，指挥官稍微平静下来，继续说道："正如我所说，你第一次同步率测试的成绩是 56%。之后你有了显著提升，达到 70%，然后是 80%。最终，根据赤木博士一个月前的报告，你已经达到了 90%。" 源渡解释道，尽管对真嗣之前的成绩感到惊讶，但仍保持着无动于衷的表情。

"Now Shinji are you ready to hear your results from today?" Gendo asked.  
"现在，真嗣，你准备好听你今天的成绩了吗？" 源渡问道。

_I mustn't run away! I mustn't run away! I mustn't run away! I won't run away!_ Shinji told himself, bracing for a good tongue lashing from his overbearing father.  
我不能逃跑！我不能逃跑！我不能逃跑！我不会逃跑！真嗣对自己说，准备迎接他那专横父亲的一顿痛斥。

"I take it by your silence you are." Gendo smirked once again. "You're scores today, were…"  
"从你的沉默来看，你应该是准备好了。" 源渡再次冷笑道，"你今天的分数是……"

_Oh great here it comes!_ Shinji thought to himself, cringing inwardly, but showing no fear on his exterior.  
哦，又来了！真嗣暗自想着，内心一阵抽搐，但外表依旧没有显露出丝毫恐惧。

"93 percent, a three percent increase from the last time you took these tests.", Gendo finally revealed the results to a very shocked Shinji, as he tossed the folder across the table for Shinji to read.  
“93%，比上次测试提高了 3%。” 源渡终于向震惊不已的真嗣公布了结果，并将文件夹扔到桌对面让真嗣查看。

"Well, go ahead, read it." Gendo instructed his son, who did not follow, since he was still paralyzed by the results of the test.  
“嗯，看吧。” 源渡指示着自己的儿子，但真嗣并未遵从，因为他仍因测试结果而感到震惊，无法动弹。

"You were able to outscore both the First and Second child by 12 percent combined (6 percent for each), as they were only able to achieve a 87 percent sync ratio." Gendo explained; Shinji still sat silently.  
"你能够比第一和第二适格者高出 12%的综合成绩（每人 6%），因为他们只能达到 87%的同步率。" 源渡解释道；真嗣依旧静静地坐着。

"Now 93 percent is a very good sync ratio Shinji, but you can do much better. As I've been informed by Doctor Akagi, Major Katsuragi, and second Lt. Maya, they've all asked and you've responded the same way to the question that I am about to ask" said the elder Ikari as he removed his glasses, revealing for the first time, since Shinji could remember, his eyes.  
"现在 93%的同步率已经非常不错了，真嗣，但你可以做得更好。正如赤木博士、葛城少校和二等兵真由美所告知我的，他们都问过你，而你对我要问的问题给出了相同的回答。" 老伊吹说着摘下眼镜，这是真嗣记忆中第一次看到他的眼睛。

"How have you're scores climbed so much? Now I know your standard answer has been that you don't know, but I won't stand for that answer Shinji. Because I know that you are aware of why your scores have jumped so much in the past month. So tell me." Gendo commanded, as his son shook with nerves  
"你的成绩是如何提升这么多的？我知道你一贯的回答是不知道，但我不接受这个答案，真嗣。因为我知道你清楚为什么你的成绩在过去一个月里大幅提升。所以告诉我。" 源渡命令道，他的儿子因紧张而颤抖。

"Honestly sir, I have no idea" Shinji answered. He knew as those words left his lips they were the wrong ones to say.  
"老实说，先生，我真不知道。" 真嗣回答道。他知道这些话一出口，就是错误的回答。

"THAT'S BULLSHIT PILOT IKARI!" Gendo roared, closing the distance between Shinji and himself to the point where Shinji could literally taste the tobacco coming off of Gendo's breath.  
"你这是在胡扯，碇真嗣！" 源堂咆哮着，逼近真嗣，直到真嗣能实实在在地感受到源堂呼吸中夹带的烟草味。

"I can tell when you're lying, and you're doing it right now." Gendo hissed into his son's ear, "Now either tell me or I'll make sure you never pilot Unit-01 again. Do you understand?"  
"我看得出你在撒谎，你现在就在这么做。" 源堂在他儿子耳边低声威胁，"要么现在告诉我，要么我保证你再也别想驾驶初号机。明白了吗？"

The stench of his breath began to upset Shinji's stomach  
他呼出的气息开始让真嗣感到恶心

_I musn't run away, I musn't run away, I won't run away.,_ Shinji mentally repeated his mantra in his head. Though this time it didn't take as many times to stand up for himself.  
我不能逃跑，我不能逃跑，我不会逃跑。真嗣在心里反复念叨着他的座右铭。尽管这次他为自己站起来并没有重复太多次。

"DAMN IT! I DON'T KNOW COMMANDER! IF I DID DON'T YOU THINK I'D TELL YOU?" Shinji howled back, immediately shooting a glare as sharp as a double-edged sword that could have very well pierced Gendo's face.  
"该死！我不知道，指挥官！如果我知道，你以为我不会告诉你吗？" 真嗣咆哮着回应，立刻投去一道如双刃剑般锐利的目光，仿佛能直刺源堂的脸庞。

"Hmmm…. You really don't know do you?", Gendo asked, not soliciting a response.  
"嗯……你真的不知道吗？"，源渡问道，并没有期待回答。

Shinji's huffed as he regained his composure again. He was still shaken from what he had done.  
真嗣深吸一口气，再次恢复了镇定。他仍然为自己所做的事情感到震惊。

Gendo returned to his seat and smirked again before saying, "Well done Third Child. You've passed your first test."  
源渡回到座位上，再次露出微笑，然后说道："干得好，第三适格者。你已经通过了你的第一个考验。"

Shinji just stared back in shock and awe at what he had just heard.  
真嗣只是震惊而敬畏地回望着他刚刚听到的一切。

"Test?" Shinji said aloud.  
“测试？”真嗣大声说道。

"Correct.", Gendo replied sharply. "This psychological test was to see whether or not you could hold your ground to a certain degree when faced with an obstacle. You did and thus passed this test of mine." Gendo explained with a straight face again.  
“正确。”源渡尖锐地回答，“这个心理测试是为了看看你在面对障碍时能否在一定程度上坚持立场。你做到了，因此通过了我的这项测试。”源渡再次面无表情地解释道。

"What? Now I'm being tested by you? Now, when the Angels have been defeated? What the hell is this about?" Shinji barraged the elder Ikari with questions.  
"什么？现在连你也要测试我？就在使徒都被击败之后？这到底是怎么回事？" 真嗣连珠炮似的向老伊卡里发问。

"Do not question my methods Third Child. Although it is true that the timing may seem inappropriate, this test was a necessity. You have shown unwillingness to defend yourself in the field before, if you remember." Gendo remarked.  
"不要质疑我的方法，第三适格者。虽然这个测试的时机看似不妥，但它却是必要的。你还记得吗，你在战场上曾表现出不愿自卫的态度。" 源渡评论道。

Images of EVA-Unit 3 strangling Unit 1 began to flash through Shinji's mind, followed by those of Unit 01 eviscerating the black Evangelion moments later. Shinji retched slightly at these grotesque memories.  
真嗣的脑海中闪过 EVA-03 扼住初号机的画面，紧接着是初号机随后撕裂黑色使徒的场景。这些恐怖的记忆让真嗣不禁微微作呕。

"As I was saying…" Gendo continued, "Your abilities back then were questionable. It is only natural that we evaluate your psyche during a time of limited conflict. Now we move onto the second test."  
"正如我刚才所说…" 源渡继续道，"你当时的能力令人存疑。在冲突有限的时期评估你的心理状态是理所当然的。现在我们进入第二项测试。"

_There's more?!_ Shinji thought with a minor panic.  
还有？！真嗣心中略感慌乱地想道。

"Do not think that you are getting any special treatment either, Third Child. The other two pilots will go through the same evaluation. I advise you not to reveal these methods to either of them." Gendo explained as a spotlight revealed a black chair with the NERV emblem on its back rest.  
"你也别以为会得到什么特殊待遇，第三适格者。其他两位驾驶员也将接受同样的评估。我建议你不要向他们透露这些方法。" 源渡解释道，此时一束聚光灯照亮了一把黑色椅子，椅背上印有 NERV 的标志。

Shinji attempted to observe the chair from where he sat, still blinded by the new source of light. The chair itself appeared to almost look like an office chair, composed of leather, but with a high backrest. However, multiple wires could be seen extruding from the base of the chair itself.  
真嗣试图从他坐的位置观察那把椅子，但仍被新的光源所眩目。那椅子看起来几乎像是一把办公椅，由皮革制成，但带有高高的靠背。然而，可以看到多根电线从椅子底部伸出。

"Do you know why I always wear these?" Gendo asked as Shinji returned his gaze to his father, who was indicating toward the blood red glasses that remained on the table before him. "The eyes have been said to be doorways to the soul. If observed carefully, one may gain infinite knowledge of a person by just gazing into their eyes for a moment." Gendo explained further.  
“你知道我为什么总是戴着这些吗？”源渡问道，当真嗣将目光转回父亲时，他正指向桌前那副血红色的眼镜。“眼睛被认为是通往灵魂的门户。如果仔细观察，只需凝视某人的眼睛片刻，就可能获得关于那个人的无限知识。”源渡进一步解释道。

Shinji glanced into his father's eyes for the first time and saw ferocity within them. These were the eyes of a man who would not be denied his desires.  
真嗣第一次瞥向父亲的眼睛，看到了其中的凶猛。这些是绝不会被拒绝其欲望的男人的眼睛。

"I can see much from your eyes as well Shinji. Your mind is like an open book to me…" Gendo continued.  
"从你的眼中，我也能看到很多，真嗣。你的心思对我来说就像一本摊开的书……" 源渡继续说道。

These words made Shinji shiver, as a pair of golden eyes overlapped the Commander's for a moment.  
这些话让真嗣打了个寒颤，仿佛有一双金色的眼睛在指挥官的眼睛上重叠了一瞬间。

"Although I have much confidence in my own abilities to read what people are really thinking, it is required that we perform a more _formal_ test for this evaluation. What you see before you is a type of polygraph test, more advanced than anything law enforcement used to use. You will be asked a series of 20 questions while seated within this chair. If you lie while answering any of the questions, I will know one way or another. The number of truthful answers you need in order to pass will be left to my discretion." Gendo explained as Shinji's gaze returned to chair itself. "Now please have a seat." Gendo commanded.  
"虽然我对自己洞察人心的能力很有信心，但为了这次评估，我们需要进行一个更正式的测试。你面前的是一种测谎仪，比执法机构过去使用的任何设备都要先进。你将坐在这把椅子上回答一系列 20 个问题。如果你在回答任何问题时撒谎，我都会知道。你需要回答多少个真实答案才能通过，将由我决定。" 源渡解释道，真嗣的目光再次回到了椅子上。"现在请坐下。" 源渡命令道。

Shinji slowly rose from his place at the table and made his way over to next test. He hadn't been so anxious to sit in a chair since the first time he had sat within an entry plug so long ago. He gently sat in the chair as the Commander positioned himself directly in front, with a file in hand. The chair was comfortable to a degree, except for a number of unknown objects prodding Shinji's back through the leather exterior.  
真嗣缓缓地从餐桌旁站起身，走向下一个测试。自从很久以前第一次坐进插入栓以来，他从未如此紧张地坐过椅子。他轻轻地坐下，而司令则站在他正前方，手里拿着一份文件。椅子在某种程度上还算舒适，只是皮革外层下有几样不明物体戳着真嗣的背。

_Sensors…_ Shinji thought to himself as he turned his head back to his father.  
传感器……真嗣心中暗想，转头看向他的父亲。

"Lets begin…" Gendo announced. "Question 1: What is your full name?"  
“开始吧……”源堂宣布道。“问题 1：你的全名是什么？”

Shinji took in a deep breath and began his answers, "Shinji Kozu Ikari"  
真嗣深吸一口气，开始回答：“真嗣·小津·碇”

"very good" Gendo responded, without hesitation he went to the next question, "Question 2: Who are your parents?"  
“很好。” 源渡毫不犹豫地继续下一个问题，“问题 2：你的父母是谁？”

Shinji hesitated ever so slightly before this question, knowing full well how he had to answer "Yui and Gendo Ikari"  
面对这个问题，真嗣略微犹豫了一下，他很清楚自己必须这样回答：“碇唯和碇源渡”

"correct" Gendo replied, again not hesitating to move to the next question, "Question 3: When were you born?"  
"正确"，源渡回答道，毫不犹豫地继续下一个问题，"问题 3：你何时出生？"

"June 6th 2001" Shinji fired back, trying to avoid making contact with Gendo's eyes.  
"2001 年 6 月 6 日"，真嗣迅速回应，试图避开与源渡眼神的接触。

"Yes.." Gendo responded. "是的.."，源渡回应道。

**About 20 minutes later: 大约 20 分钟后：**

"you've done well Shinji. So far as I can tell you've lied to me only twice and the sensors haven't picked anything up yet" Gendo began before giving his son his final question  
“你做得很好，真嗣。据我所知，你只对我撒了两次谎，传感器目前还没有检测到任何异常。” 源渡开始说道，随后向他的儿子提出了最后一个问题。

Shinji just sat, his breathing had become labored and he was starting to develop cold sweats beneath his shirt and on his forehead.  
真嗣只是坐着，他的呼吸变得急促，衬衫下和额头开始冒出冷汗。

"Are you ready for the final question of this test?" Gendo asked smirking, "before I ask this, you have to know a few things. First this is most likely the most difficult question of all, as such I will give you three chances to answer it truthfully. Should you lie to me I will consider the test a failure and you will not be allowed to pilot Unit-01 until further notice. Furthermore, should you refuse to answer the question I will consider it a lie, and once again will automatically fail. However, should you chose this route I will revoke your pilot license and you will be immediately removed from the NERV premises is that clear?" Gendo's eyes narrowed on his son to gauge his reaction.  
"你准备好回答这次测试的最后一个问题了吗？" 源堂带着一丝冷笑问道，"在提问之前，你有几件事需要知道。首先，这很可能是所有问题中最难的一个，因此我会给你三次机会来诚实地回答。如果你对我撒谎，我会认为测试失败，你将不被允许驾驶零号机，直到另行通知。此外，如果你拒绝回答这个问题，我会将其视为谎言，同样会自动判定失败。然而，如果你选择这条路，我将吊销你的飞行员执照，并立即将你从 NERV 的场所中移除，清楚了吗？" 源堂的目光紧盯着他的儿子，以评估他的反应。

As if Shinji wasn't exhausted enough, now he had to truthfully answer a very tough question from a person who could tell within a second if he was lying.  
仿佛真嗣还不够疲惫似的，现在他还不得不诚实地回答一个来自能在一秒钟内判断他是否在撒谎的人的极其困难的问题。

Shinji inhaled deeply, "Yes very clear commander"  
真嗣深吸了一口气，"是的，非常清楚，指挥官"

"Good, now question 20: When you sync with your EVA do you feel someone else inside along with you? In other words does it feel like another person is there guiding you through when things get tough?" Gendo smirked, he really had no intention of revoking his sons license. It was just amusing to see him squirm as Gendo posed a very hard question to him. Silence gripped the room as Gendo continued to stare at his son who was clearly in mental turmoil trying to figure out how to answer the question.  
"很好，现在第 20 个问题：当你与你的 EVA 同步时，你是否感觉到有另一个人与你同在？换句话说，当情况变得艰难时，是否感觉有另一个人在那里引导你？" 源渡嘴角勾起一抹笑意，他其实并没有打算撤销儿子的执照。只是看着他在自己提出的难题面前挣扎，觉得颇为有趣。房间内一片寂静，源渡继续盯着明显陷入心理挣扎的儿子，等待着他的回答。

"N-No I-I…" Shinji stammered, immediately he was cut off by Gendo  
"不，不，我……" 真嗣结巴着，立刻被源渡打断

"That's strike one Shinji." Gendo stated, continuing to smirk as his son squirmed  
"这是第一次警告，真嗣。" 源渡说道，继续带着笑意看着儿子不安地扭动

"W-what?" Shinji stammered  
"什么？" 真嗣结巴地说道

"That's a lie so that's one! Two more chances Shinji" Gendo smirk grew wider, as Shinji just squirmed even more.  
"那是谎言，所以你还有两次机会，真嗣。" 源堂的笑容更甚，而真嗣则更加不安地扭动着。

_I musn't run away, I WON'T RUN AWAY!_ Shinji repeated one more time. As he did, Shinji sat upright and stopped squirming, immediately noticing the change Gendo's smirk melted of his face as it shifted to a look of confusion and anger.  
我不能逃跑，我不会逃跑！真嗣再次重复着。随着他的话语，真嗣坐直了身子，停止了扭动，立刻注意到源堂的笑容从脸上消失，转而变成了一副困惑和愤怒的表情。

"M-Mother!" Shinji answered, "I can feel her when I sync up with Unit-01. She is there, I can't explain how or why it feels like sometimes she's at the controls, guiding, helping, in a way telling me what to do and she helps me complete my missions with success when things get tough. She's always there advising and protecting me, like a true parent should" Shinji now had the smirk on his face.  
"妈妈！" 真嗣回答道，"当我与零号机同步时，我能感受到她。她在那里，我无法解释为什么有时候感觉像是她在操控，引导，帮助，某种程度上告诉我该做什么，当情况变得艰难时，她帮助我成功完成任务。她总是在那里给予建议和保护我，就像一个真正的父母应该做的那样。" 真嗣的脸上现在带着一丝得意的微笑。

Gendo looked shaken now, as he saw the confidence Shinji was exuding. So as not to show any weakness, quickly he cleared his throat and began to speak to Shinji.  
源渡现在看起来有些动摇，因为他看到了真嗣所展现出的自信。为了不显露出任何弱点，他迅速清了清嗓子，开始对真嗣说话。

"Very good Pilot Ikari, that is all" Gendo dismissed his son. Oddly enough Shinji refused to move from his seat.  
"很好，伊卡里驾驶员，就这样吧。" 源渡打发他的儿子。奇怪的是，真嗣拒绝从座位上起身。

"I have a question for you now Father" Shinji began gaining more confidence as he saw his father begin to squirm.  
"我现在有个问题想问您，父亲。" 真嗣开始变得更加自信，因为他看到他的父亲开始不安起来。

"That is ALL! Pilot Ikari, I'm very busy so now…" Gendo said quickly, too quickly and Shinji picked up on it.  
"就这些了！碇真嗣驾驶员，我很忙，所以现在…" 源渡急促地说道，太急促了，真嗣察觉到了。

"Strike one Father!" Shinji shot back, "Now who's the one that's lying. I can see it in your eyes, your soul is an open book to me! You're scared aren't you?"  
"一击命中，父亲！" 真嗣反击道，"现在是谁在撒谎呢。我能从您的眼睛里看出来，您的灵魂对我来说就像一本敞开的书！您害怕了，对吧？"

"That's enough Third Child! Now leave or I will have you removed" Gendo commanded  
"够了，第三适格者！现在离开，否则我会让人把你赶出去。" 源堂命令道

"Hmph.. Don't think so, if you think you can waste half of my day and then not expect retaliation from me in return you're 100 percent wrong! So sit down it's my turn to ask" Shinji's smirk grew wider  
"哼...别以为可以，如果你以为浪费了我半天时间而不期待我的反击，那你百分百错了！所以坐下，轮到我问了。" 真嗣的笑容更甚

Seeing no other way to rid Shinji from his office, and running short on time, grabbed his glasses and placed them on his face.  
眼看无法让真嗣离开办公室，又时间紧迫，源堂抓起眼镜戴在脸上。

"Fine Shinji now what is it?" Gendo asked impatiently  
"好吧，真嗣，现在是什么事？" 源渡不耐烦地问道

"Did… Did you ever love my mother?" Shinji asked, swallowing a lump in his throat. Gendo stayed silent  
"你……你曾经爱过我母亲吗？" 真嗣问道，喉咙里哽咽着。源渡沉默不语

"If you refuse to answer the question father, I won't pilot Unit-01 ever again. Before you agree to those terms, remember this: she's the only one that will respond to me, she won't accept the dummy plug, and she won't achieve her full potential without me behind the wheel. So father what will it be" Shinji's smirk had transformed into a smile as Gendo continued to squirm, under the pressure of his sons threats.  
"如果你拒绝回答这个问题，父亲，我将不再驾驶零号机。在你同意这些条件之前，记住这一点：她是唯一会回应我的，她不会接受模拟插入栓，没有我在驾驶舱里，她也无法发挥全部潜力。那么，父亲，你将如何选择？" 真嗣的冷笑已经变成了微笑，而源渡在他的儿子的威胁下继续挣扎。

"Did… Did I ever love your mother? What kind of question is that Shinji? Don't waste my time with such nonsense…" Gendo protested  
"我…我有没有爱过你母亲？真嗣，你这是什么问题？别用这种无聊的事浪费我的时间…" 源堂抗议道

"Strike two father! One more and Unit-01 will never activate again" Shinji's smile grew even wider.  
"第二击了，父亲！再来一次，零号机就永远别想启动了" 真嗣的笑容更加灿烂了。

Gendo pinched the bridge of his nose, near his eyes and began to rub them. There was no avoiding this one, for the first time in a long time he'd have to tell the truth about a rather sore subject, Yui.  
源堂捏了捏鼻梁，靠近眼睛开始揉搓。这次是躲不过去了，很久以来第一次，他不得不在一个相当敏感的话题——唯——上说出真相。

"Did I ever love your mother Shinji? I loved her more than anything in the world" Gendo answered, trying to regain his composure after Shinji had turned the tables.  
"我曾爱过你母亲吗，真嗣？我爱她胜过世上的一切。" 源渡回答道，试图在真嗣扭转局面后恢复镇定。

"That is all Commander, and thank you" Shinji saluted and turned on his heel and left  
"报告完毕，指挥官，谢谢您。" 真嗣敬礼后，转身离去。

"By your leave pilot Ikari. By the way, has anyone visited you that you do not know or have ever heard of?" Gendo asked  
"请允许我离开，碇真嗣驾驶员。顺便问一下，有没有你不认识或从未听说过的访客来过？" 源渡问道

Shinji froze immediately, but still tried to keep his confidence level high.  
真嗣立刻僵住了，但仍试图保持自信。

"Yes I have" Shinji gave his answer,  
“是的，我有。”真嗣回答道，

"Name" The Commander demanded  
“名字。”指挥官命令道

"Like you said, you know more about me than I know about myself, so I'm assuming you know already" Shinji responded defiantly  
"就像你说的，你比我更了解我自己，所以我猜你已经知道了。" 真嗣带着一丝挑衅回应道。

"NAME!" Gendo barked his demand this time, "you will not leave until I know it!"  
"名字！" 源堂这次厉声命令道，"在我知道之前，你不能离开！"

"Well it's of little concequence, but if you must know sometime you may want to look up, Tashigi Heinrich Soryu" With his answer Shinji walked out of the commander's office.  
"其实这无关紧要，但如果你非要知道的话，某天你或许可以查查，塔希吉·海因里希·索龙。" 说完，真嗣走出了指挥官的办公室。

"Fuyutski get in here NOW!" Gendo roared his command. Within 2 seconds Sub-commander Kozu Fuyutski entered the room.  
"立即给我进来，冬月！" 源渡怒吼着下达命令。不到两秒钟，副司令官冬月耕造便进入了房间。

"Gave your son quite the grilling Ikari?" Fuyutski asked with a chuckle  
"对你的儿子进行了相当严格的盘问吧，源渡？" 冬月笑着问道

"Yes Fuyutski, now let's get down to it. Did you see the Third Child's scores on his Sync test today?" Gendo asked  
"是的，冬月，现在让我们进入正题。你看到第三适格者今天的同步测试成绩了吗？" 源渡询问道

"Yes I did, very impressive." Fuyutski replied,  
"是的，我确实这么做了，非常令人印象深刻。" 冬月回答道，

"Indeed" Gendo nodded in agreement  
"确实如此。" 碇源堂点头表示同意，

"Why are you having them do this Ikari? It's not like the Angels will be around anytime soon, there are no threats for any uprisings anywhere in the world, so why…" Fuyutski questioned before being cutoff by Gendo.  
"你为什么要让他们这么做，碇？天使们不会很快出现，世界上也没有任何地方有威胁或叛乱，那么为什么……" 冬月质疑道，但被碇源堂打断了。

"Fuyutski, you are not to question my motives as commander. You are to listen to my commands and make sure they are carried out." Gendo shouted  
"冬月，你作为指挥官，不得质疑我的动机。你要听从我的命令，并确保它们得到执行。" 源堂大声说道

"Of course sir, pardon me for overstepping my bounds" Fuyustki responded to Gendo's outburst  
"当然，长官，请原谅我逾越了界限。" 冬月对源堂的爆发回应道

"Noted" Gendo answered, "Now as you know we've been in contact with our branch in Germany. Well during the last few years, I've had one of our men keeping tabs on that branch and reporting back to me with what he's found. The man, as you know is your son, Tashigi Heinrich Soryu."  
"记住了。" 源堂回答，"如你所知，我们一直与我们在德国的分支保持联系。在过去几年里，我让我们的一个人密切关注那个分支，并向我汇报他的发现。这个人，如你所知，是你的儿子，塔希吉·海因里希·索龙。"

"Yes, this is not news to me commander. I'm assuming you called me in here for more than just this story" Fuyutski answered  
"是的，指挥官，这个消息对我来说并不新鲜。我想您叫我进来不仅仅是为了这个故事吧。" 冬月回答道

"Of course. I called you in to inform you, that Tashigi is headed to Tokyo-3 and according to reports will be here in about a week." Gendo explained  
"当然。我叫你来是要告诉你，达斯琪正在前往第三新东京市的路上，据报告她大约一周后就会到达。" 源渡解释道

"What does this have to do with me?" Fuyutski asked  
"这和我有什么关系？" 冬月问道

"I have to know, since this does involve Tashigi, if your personal feelings for the boy will affect your performance during the time he is here." Gendo explicated  
"我必须了解，既然这涉及到了达斯琪，你对这个年轻人的个人感情是否会影响他在此期间你的表现。" 源堂阐明道

"First of all he's not a boy, not anymore. And secondly I'll do as I'm instructed, Tashigi will not affect that." Fuyutski confided in Gendo  
"首先，他已经不是孩子了，不再是。其次，我会按照指示行事，达斯琪不会影响这一点。" 冬月向源堂坦白

"Very good that is all" Gendo instructed  
"很好，那就这样。" 源堂指示道

"Then by your leave Commander" Fuyutski said as he turned on a heel to go.  
"那么，恕我先行告退，指挥官。" 冬月说完，便转身离去。

"One more thing Kozu" Gendo said, causing Fuyutski to stop dead in his tracks.  
"还有一件事，薰。" 碇源堂的话让冬月立刻停下了脚步。

"What's that Gendo?" Fuyutski responded with surprise that his superior had called him by his first name  
"什么事，碇？" 冬月惊讶地回应，没想到上司会直呼其名。

"I'll be leaving on business in about an hour, to observe the development of our new branch in Italy. I'll most likely be gone for about a week, so during the interm you are to head up operations here." Gendo instructed  
"我大约一小时后就要出差，去观察我们在意大利新分部的进展。我大概会离开一周左右，所以这段时间里，你要负责这里的运营。" 源渡指示道

"Very good commander" With that Fuyutski headed out the door.  
"遵命，指挥官。" 说完，冬月便走出了门。

_I hope I can trust him_ Gendo thought as he packed his brief case and prepared for his departure.  
"希望我能信任他。" 源渡一边想着，一边收拾着公文包，准备出发。

**Tokyo-3, Outside NERV Headquarters 3:45 PM  
第三新东京市，NERV 总部外 下午 3:45**

_I can't believe it._ Shinji thought with a smirk on his face. _I stood up to him!_  
真不敢相信，真嗣脸上带着一丝得意的笑容想道。我竟然反抗了他！

Shinji was now making his way toward the train station, in order to catch a ride back to his neighborhood. Misato still had paperwork to complete, while Rei and Asuka had gone on ahead with out him. Times of _peace_ meant shorter days of work within the Geofront, at least for the EVA pilots.  
真嗣正朝着火车站走去，打算乘车返回自己的街区。美里还有文件要处理，而绫波和明日香已经先行一步，没有等他。和平时期意味着在地下都市的工作日会缩短，至少对于 EVA 驾驶员来说是这样。

_If I hurry, I can catch the 4:00 train._ Shinji thought as he quickened his pace.  
"如果我快点，还能赶上四点的火车。" 碇真嗣加快了脚步，心里这样想着。

As Shinji made his way into the nearly deserted train station, a voice called out to him, "Hey dumkopf, did the Commander rip you a new one or what?"  
当碇真嗣走进几乎空无一人的火车站时，一个声音朝他喊道：“嘿，笨蛋，指挥官是不是又把你训了一顿？”

Shinji just gave Asuka one of the biggest smiles he could muster before replying, "That's not working today Asuka! I'm a new man!"  
碇真嗣只是尽力挤出了一个最大的笑容，然后回答说：“今天这招不管用，明日香！我已经是崭新的我了！”

Asuka just stared at Shinji and thought to herself, _What's up with him? He looks so, so happy! He's kind of cute when he…ack! Watch what your saying Asuka!_  
明日香只是盯着真嗣，心里想，他这是怎么了？看起来好，好开心！他这样子还挺可爱的…哎呀！注意你的言辞，明日香！

"Hmph, so you didn't piss your pants when the Commander did your review." Asuka finally retorted, with a little less force than usual.  
“哼，看来指挥官审查你的时候，你没尿裤子嘛。”明日香终于反驳道，不过语气比平时弱了些。

"Even better. I actually held my ground with him. Sure, I was scared out of my mind, but I actually did it! I've never felt so good before!" Shinji said while uncharacteristically punching the air.  
“更棒的是，我居然在他面前站稳了脚跟。虽然我吓得要死，但我真的做到了！我从来没有感觉这么好过！”真嗣说着，破天荒地挥了挥拳头。

_Is this really Shinji?! Spineless, down on himself, not a hope for him Shinji? I've never seen him feeling this good about himself. Not like I ever helped though..._ Asuka thought as her gaze shifted downward.  
这真的是真嗣吗？！那个自卑、自怨自艾、毫无希望的真嗣？我从没见过他这么自信。虽然我也没帮上什么忙... 明日香想着，目光不由自主地向下移去。

"So, what about your results? How'd you do on the tests today?" Asuka asked, finally relenting on her usual tirade.  
“那你的成绩怎么样？今天考试考得如何？”明日香终于放下了平时的咄咄逼人，问道。

"Uh, well…" Shinji began.  
“呃，这个…”真嗣开始说道。

_I can't say that I got higher than her. Asuka can be a pain to me at times, but she's not a bad person. The past few months have shown me that. Besides, I don't want her to…_ Shinji thought as memories of what Asuka was like after her encounter with the 15th Angel.  
"我不能说我比她更优秀。明日香有时确实让我头疼，但她并不是坏人。过去几个月的经历让我明白了这一点。此外，我不想让她……" 真嗣思索着，脑海中浮现出明日香在与第 15 使徒遭遇后的样子。

"…lets just say that its an all time record for me. I wasn't told the actual score. The Commander likes to withhold information from me all the time I guess. Thinks it will break me or something…" Shinji said before giving a pathetically fake laugh.  
"……这么说吧，这对我来说是个前所未有的记录。他们没告诉我具体分数。指挥官总是喜欢对我隐瞒信息，我想他是觉得这样会让我崩溃或者什么的……" 真嗣说完，发出了一声可怜兮兮的假笑。

"Right…", Asuka replied. "“好吧…”，明日香回应道。

_Must have not been that much of a record…, she thought.  
想必也不是什么大不了的记录…, 她心想。_

"Anyway, how about I cook something special for dinner tonight?" Shinji asked. "Maybe I'll make a German dish for you…I mean us Asuka. I've been trying to practice on more international dishes for a while. We can invite Rei over. Where is she anyway?", Shinji wondered, finally noticing the absence of his sister.  
“对了，今晚我来做点特别的晚餐怎么样？” 真嗣提议道，“或许我可以为你…不，为我们做一道德国菜。我最近一直在尝试练习更多国际菜肴。我们可以叫上零一起来。她现在在哪儿呢？” 真嗣这才注意到妹妹不在场。

"Oh that…" Asuka began. "Well, I think she made a connection with that guy with the lunch room earlier. She went off with him afterward and said that she'd catch up to me after. That's why I'm still here at the station." Asuka explained.  
“哦，那个啊…” 明日香开始解释，“我想她和那个食堂的小伙子搭上线了。她后来跟他一起走了，还说之后会追上我。这就是为什么我还在这儿等。” 明日香解释道。

"You let her go off with a stranger?! What if he takes advantage of her? What if she's hurt? What if…" Shinji started before being cut off.  
"你让她跟一个陌生人走了？！万一他占她便宜怎么办？万一她受伤了怎么办？万一……" 真嗣还没说完就被打断了。

"Don't worry, she's fine. Look!" Asuka said, holding up her cell phone.  
"别担心，她没事。看！" 明日香说着，举起了她的手机。

A text message was one the screen that read:  
屏幕上显示着一条短信，内容是：

Asuka Do not wait for me at the train station. The young man that I met in the lunch room will be escorting me home this afternoon. He is very polite and says that he is from the German Branch of NERV. I haven't gotten his name yet though. Tell Shinji that I hope his meeting with the Commander went well and that I will see you both later. Ayanami  
明日香，别在火车站等我了。今天下午，我在餐厅遇到的那位年轻人会送我回家。他非常有礼貌，自称来自 NERV 德国分部。不过我还没来得及问他的名字。告诉真嗣，希望他和司令的会面顺利，晚点见。绫波

Asuka snapped the phone closed after a moment before saying, "That girl has come a long way, but still needs a ton of help. I mean come one, not asking what his name was? How does someone do that?"  
明日香啪的一声合上手机，过了一会儿才说：“那女孩进步了好多，但还是需要很多帮助。我的意思是，连他的名字都不问？怎么会有这样的人？”

TRAIN 4-B, bound for East Tokyo-3, arriving on Track 2., the P.A. system announced.  
前往东第三新东京市的 4-B 次列车即将进站，停靠 2 号站台。

"We better get going.", Asuka said as she gripped onto Shinji's arm, dragging the boy behind her. "I'm not waiting another hour to get a ride home!"  
"我们最好快点走。" 明日香说着，紧紧抓住真嗣的手臂，拖着男孩跟在她后面。"我可不想再等一个小时才能搭车回家！"

**Tokyo-3; Misato's Apartment Complex** **5:00 PM** (for lack of a better name)  
第三新东京市；美里公寓楼 下午 5:00（姑且这么称呼）

"Mein Gott! Why did it take this long to go grocery shopping? Please explain it to me again?" Asuka said as she struggled to carry an overstuffed shopping bag  
"我的天！为什么买个菜要花这么长时间？请再给我解释一遍？" 明日香说着，吃力地提着一个塞得满满当当的购物袋

"It can't be helped!" Shinji grunted under the weight of his own bag. This particular recipe requires quite a few particular ingredients." He explained as the two entered the elevator, making their way up to the apartment.  
"没办法了！" 真嗣嘟囔着，承受着自己背包的重量。"这个特别的食谱需要很多特别的材料。" 他解释道，两人走进电梯，向公寓上升。

"Well, if being a dog of the military doesn't work out for you, at least you can become Iron Chef: Tokyo-3!", Asuka teased as the two made there way off of the elevator and to Misato's door.  
"好吧，如果当军队的狗不适合你，至少你可以成为东京-3 的铁厨！"，明日香调侃道，两人离开电梯，走向美里家的门。

"Do they still make that?" Shinji wondered aloud as he rummaged for his keys in his pocket.  
"那个节目还在播吗？" 真嗣边从口袋里翻找钥匙边大声问道。

"They're in your back pocket! Let me get them…" Asuka said as she shifted the weight of her bag into her left arm, before reaching out for Shinji's back pocket. "Don't get any ideas either!"  
"它们在你后兜里！让我来拿……" 明日香说着，将背包的重量转移到左臂，然后伸手去够真嗣的后兜。"别动歪脑筋哦！"

As Asuka reached in and grabbed the apartment keys, Shinji was sweating bullets and was red enough to be mistaken for Unit 2.  
当明日香伸手进去抓住公寓钥匙时，真嗣紧张得汗流浃背，脸红得足以被误认为是二号机。

"Alright, got them." Asuka said as she finally moved forward to unlock the door.  
"好了，拿到了。" 明日香说着，终于上前去开门。

As soon as the click was heard Asuka pushed the door forward and entered the dark living room. Shinji soon began to follow until the light came on and he heard a thud.  
一听到咔哒声，明日香便推开门，走进昏暗的客厅。真嗣正要跟上，灯光突然亮起，紧接着他听到了一声闷响。

"Aiyee!", Asuka shrieked.  
“哎呀！”明日香尖叫道。

"Asuka!" Shinji yelled as he dropped his bundle and ran to see what was wrong.  
“明日香！”真嗣大喊一声，丢下手中的东西，跑过去查看发生了什么。

Asuka was standing by the entrance to the kitchen, staring at something that was making her shake. Shinji turned to where Asuka's gazed was and saw a raven haired man with golden eyes sitting at the kitchen table.  
明日香站在厨房入口旁，盯着某样让她颤抖的东西。真嗣顺着明日香的目光看去，只见一个黑发金眸的男子正坐在餐桌旁。

"Velcome home Zinji! Vhats for dinner?"  
欢迎回家，真嗣！晚餐吃什么？

_**To Be Continued… 待续……**_

**A/N: Ok just a couple of things. 1 hope you liked the cliffhanger HAHAHA!  
作者的话：好的，有几点要说。1. 希望你喜欢这个悬念哈哈哈！**

2. 与我的合著者共同理解到，丽通常不吃红肉。但由于她角色性格的变化，我们认为用这个作为例子来展示是合适的。**

**3. You may notice that there is a relationship starting to form here between Rei and Tashigi. This will be a big plot point throughout the story, along with the development of Asuka and Shinji's as well.

再次与 BIGGESTDREAMER86 共同创作**

**Recap: "Velcome Home Zhinji vhats for dinner?"  
回顾：“欢迎回家，真嗣，晚餐吃什么？”**

"STALKER!" Asuka shouted as she met with his golden eyes  
"跟踪狂！" 明日香大喊，与他的金色眼睛对视

"Wh-What are you doing back here?" Shinji asked  
"你...你回来这里做什么？" 真嗣问道

"Well I decided that it would be polite for me to come back and re-introduce myself," Tashigi responded keeping his eyes locked on Asuka.  
"嗯，我决定回来重新自我介绍会比较礼貌，" 塔希吉回答，目光始终锁定在明日香身上。

_She's just as Mother described her_ Tashigi thought to himself as he continued to take in his little sister. Which did not go unnoticed by the fiery red-head her face contorted from shock and fear to one of anger.  
她正如母亲所描述的那样，塔希吉心中暗想，继续打量着他的小妹妹。这一举动并未逃过那位火红发色少女的注意，她的脸从震惊和恐惧扭曲成愤怒。

"PERVERT!" Asuka shouted pointing a finger in accusation at her golden-eyed "admirer." "Who is this guy dumkopf? He must be a friend of yours since he seems all so interested in getting in my pants."  
“变态！”明日香大声喊道，用手指指责着她那金眼“仰慕者”。“这家伙是谁，笨蛋？他肯定是你朋友，因为他看起来对我的裤子特别感兴趣。”

"W-What are you talking about Asuka?" Shinji stammered back "I… I never…."  
“你…你在说什么，明日香？”真嗣结巴地回应，“我…我从来没有…。”

"Relax Shinji" Tashigi interrupted, "Asuka, my dear you should not say such things it is rather inappropriate especially in front of your boyfriend"  
"放松点，真嗣。" 达斯琪打断道，"明日香，亲爱的，你不该说这种话，尤其是在你男朋友面前，这相当不合适。

"WHAT?" Asuka shouted sending her deeper into rage. Things only got worse as Tashigi's smirk grew into a huge smile. That was the breaking point for Asuka  
""什么？" 明日香大叫，怒火更盛。情况变得更糟，因为达斯琪的笑意变成了灿烂的笑容。这成了明日香的爆发点。

"UND FUSTUKEN IDIOT!" Asuka shouted as she took an apple out of the grocery bag and fired it full speed at Tashigi.  
""还有你这个蠢货！" 明日香喊着，从购物袋里抓出一个苹果，全力向达斯琪扔去。

"ACH SHCIESE!" Tashigi yelped as the fruit hurdled towards him at a blinding speed. His smile returned though and without warning he was able to snag the apple at the last second with a sweeping motion of his hand.  
"哎呀，小心！" 达西吉惊叫道，只见那水果以惊人的速度朝他飞来。然而，他的笑容又回来了，就在最后一刻，他突然伸手一挥，稳稳地接住了苹果。

Silence gripped the room for a few minutes. Tashigi began to toss the apple up and down in his hand as he studied the two pilots. Still with a smile plastered on his face, he brought the apple to his lips and bit off a huge chunk and kept a smirk as he chewed. After swallowing the chunk he'd bitten off, his smile returned.  
房间里陷入了几分钟的沉默。达西吉开始在手中上下抛接苹果，同时审视着两位驾驶员。他脸上依旧挂着笑容，将苹果送到嘴边，大口咬下一块，边嚼边露出得意的微笑。咽下那块苹果后，他的笑容再次绽放。

"Missed" Tashigi chuckled, "My dear Asuka, it's very fortunate that you decided to become an EVA pilot, because there is no way you'd make it as a baseball player." With this he let out a huge laugh, that echoed off the walls in the room.  
"没打中哦，" 达西吉轻笑道，"亲爱的明日香，你真幸运选择了成为 EVA 驾驶员，因为你要是打棒球，肯定没戏。" 说完，他放声大笑，笑声在房间里回荡。

Asuka was now red in the face with anger as he continued to laugh. She turned to Shinji, hoping to get some defense from him, however, she was stunned by what she saw. Shinji was trying his best to stifle his impending huge laugh, by placing his hand over his lips. Asuka was now extremely aggravated with the two men in the room.  
明日香此刻满脸通红，怒气冲冲，而他还在继续笑着。她转向真嗣，希望从他那里得到一些支持，然而，她被眼前的一幕惊呆了。真嗣正竭力抑制即将爆发的大笑，用手捂住嘴唇。明日香对房间里的这两个男人感到极度恼火。

Shinji was able to get control of himself. He remembered Tashigi, and he seemed to be bad news for the whole household.  
真嗣终于控制住了自己。他想起了达斯琪，似乎他对整个家庭来说都不是什么好事。

"What are you here for?" Shinji asked in a rather subdued tone.  
“你来这里做什么？”真嗣用一种相当克制的语气问道。

"An interesting question Mr. Ikari" Tashigi answered in a cocky tone. "In fact, I am here to clear up any and all issues regarding my following you this morning and afternoon. I first wish to assure you that Rei Ayanami, your sister Shinji, is fine. I saw her home and made sure she was safe inside before I left."  
"有趣的问题，碇先生。" 达西吉以一种自负的语气回答道，"实际上，我来这里是为了澄清今早和下午跟踪你的所有问题。首先，我想向你保证，你的妹妹绫波丽，即真嗣，她很安全。我亲眼看到她安全到家后才离开。

"Well thank you very much for that" Shinji replied, "that still doesn't explain how or why you are here."  
"那真是太感谢你了" 真嗣回答说，"但这仍然没有解释你是如何以及为什么在这里。

"Well I was coming to that Shinji" Tashigi began, "Now as to why I am here…"  
"我正要说到这一点，真嗣" 达西吉开始说道，"至于我为什么在这里……

"Wait Shinji, what are you doing?" A certain Red heads voice cut through their little discussion "he broke into our house we have to call the police!" Asuka shouted.  
"等等，真嗣，你在做什么？" 某个红发女孩的声音打断了他们的小讨论，"他闯进了我们家，我们必须报警！" 明日香喊道。

"Gusch!" Tashigi yelled, stopping Asuka in her tracks as she ran towards the phone.  
"住手！" 达斯琪大喊一声，让正冲向电话的明日香停下了脚步。

"Y-You're German?" Asuka stuttered utterly amazed at how Tashigi had mastered the language  
"你...你是德国人？" 明日香结结巴巴地说，完全惊讶于达斯琪对这门语言的精通。

"Indeed I am Asuka, and why I have come is about to be revealed to you. Now first please sit down so I may begin to explain." Tashigi instructed as the 2 pilots complied.  
"确实，我是明日香，我来此的目的即将向你们揭晓。现在，请先坐下，以便我开始解释。" 达斯琪指示道，两位飞行员随即遵从。

"Wunderbar, now let me begin. Asuka you may not like what you're about to hear." Tashigi began his tale, "but it's something that's been kept from you for far too long."  
"太好了，现在让我开始。明日香，你可能不会喜欢接下来要听到的内容。" 达斯琪开始讲述他的故事，"但这是对你隐瞒已久的事情。"

"Just get to the point spast" Asuka spat at him.  
"别拐弯抹角了，快说重点！" 明日香不耐烦地催促道。

"Watch your language young lady" Tashigi responded, "there's no need for name calling."  
"注意你的言辞，小姐。" 达斯琪回应道，"没必要骂人。"

He took a cigarette out of his shirt pocket, and placed it in his mouth. "Shinji do you mind if I smoke?"  
他从衬衫口袋里掏出一支烟，放进嘴里。"真嗣，介意我抽烟吗？"

"Like I could stop you?" Shinji replied sarcastically,  
"我还能拦你不成？" 真嗣讽刺地回答道，

"Touché Shinji," As Tashigi lit the cigarette and dragged it before speaking.  
"Touché 真嗣," 达斯琪点燃香烟，深吸一口后开口说道。

"Now as to how I am here, well you might want to tell Katsuragi to lock up the apartment more often." Tashigi explained with a smile, Shinji and Asuka both rolled their eyes, none too surprised that the Major had forgotten to lock up the apartment more than once.  
"至于我怎么进来的，嗯，你可能得提醒胜已记得更频繁地锁好公寓门。" 达斯琪带着微笑解释道，真嗣和明日香都翻了个白眼，对少校不止一次忘记锁门并不感到惊讶。

"As to why the answer is simple. I want to get to know my little sister." Tashigi's smile stayed plastered on his face.  
"至于原因很简单。我想了解我的小妹妹。" 达斯琪的笑容始终挂在脸上。

"Wait Misato has a brother? Did you know about this Shinji? I sure didn't, and how he spoke German…" Asuka smiled brightly in the knowledge that this was a relative.  
"等等，美里还有个哥哥？真嗣，你知道这事吗？我可是一点都不知道，而且他还会说德语……" 得知这是亲戚后，明日香开心地笑了。

"Please Asuka. Do I look anything like Katsuargi? Don't tell me I got all the brains." Tashigi sighed, "look deeply at my face Asuka do I look familiar?" (**A/N: Remember that Asuka doesn't know his name yet.)**  
"拜托，明日香。我看起来像葛城吗？别告诉我我继承了所有智慧。" 达西吉叹了口气，"仔细看看我的脸，明日香，你觉得我眼熟吗？"（作者注：记得明日香还不知道他的名字。）

Asuka's face continued to grow a deeper shade of red, as she studied the features of Tashigi. Finally in a huff of pent up fury, she lounged at Tashigi.  
明日香的脸色越来越红，她仔细端详着达西吉的五官。最终，在一股积压的怒气驱使下，她猛地扑向达西吉。

"YOU BASTARD! AREN'T YOU DEAD YET?" Asuka screamed. A red missile was bee-lining straight for Tashigi and it was likely to destroy it had not a hand reached out and grabbed a hold of it.  
"你这混蛋！还没死吗？" 明日香尖叫道。一枚红色导弹正直冲达斯琪而去，若非一只手伸出抓住了它，恐怕早已将其摧毁。

"Asuka settle down" Shinji yelled  
"明日香，冷静点" 真嗣大喊

"Let me go Shinji this bastard killed my Mother!" The young German yelled in a fit of rage, as tears began to well up in her eyes.  
"放开我，真嗣，这个混蛋杀了我母亲！" 年轻的德国少女怒吼着，眼中开始涌出泪水。

"Settle down Asuka he's too young to be your father!" Shinji's voice increased in power, and somehow he was able to subdue the German's deadly wrath.  
"冷静点，明日香，他还太年轻，不可能是你父亲！" 真嗣的声音增强了力量，不知怎的，他竟能平息这位德国少女的致命怒火。

"I must apologize I have not formally introduced myself." Tashigi took another drag of his cigarette,  
"我必须道歉，我还没有正式介绍自己。" 塔希吉吸了一口烟，

"Asuka My dear, you may not like what I'm about to reveal to you" Tashigi drew in a deep breath, "and if you do not wish for me to tell you this then I will withdraw from the house quietly and you shall never hear from me again." He dragged his cigarette once again  
"明日香，亲爱的，你可能不会喜欢我即将向你透露的事情" 塔希吉深吸了一口气，"如果你不希望我告诉你这些，那么我会安静地离开这所房子，你将永远不会再听到我的消息。" 他再次吸了一口烟

Asuka had setteled quite considerably, and sat down on the couch opposite Tashigi. Subtly she reached over, and placed her hand on top of Shinji's. Shinji lightly blushed from Asuka's contact, her hand was so warm and soft yet firm. It almost seemed poetic, Asuka was so warm and gentle sometimes, and others she was harsh and very hard edged. Slowly Shinji began to weave his fingers inside and out of Asuka's hand until the two merged together. A deafening silence gripped the room for a few minutes.  
明日香已经相当平静地坐下，坐在了与达斯琪相对的沙发上。她不经意地伸出手，轻轻放在真嗣的手上。真嗣因明日香的触碰而微微脸红，她的手温暖而柔软，却又坚定有力。这几乎像是诗意，明日香有时如此温暖温柔，而其他时候则严厉且棱角分明。真嗣缓缓地开始将手指穿插进明日香的手指间，直到两人的手完全交织在一起。房间里陷入了几分钟的震耳欲聋的沉默。

Shinji was the first to speak, leaning close to Asuka's left ear, "Asuka" he whispered, "It's up to you and I in no way want to influence your decision on how to go about this but, you may want to listen about what he has to say."  
真嗣是第一个开口的，他靠近明日香左耳，轻声说道：“明日香，”他低语，“这取决于你，我绝不想影响你如何处理这件事的决定，但你或许应该听听他要说什么。”

Asuka's mind went into a daze as Shinji's warm breath caressed her inner ear and ear lobe. She felt her entire face run hot, and her legs begin to tremble.  
真嗣温暖的气息轻抚过明日香的耳内和耳垂，她的思绪陷入一片迷茫。她感到整个脸颊发烫，双腿开始颤抖。

_Wow this is incredible, he's… he's...!_ Asuka thought to herself, _NEIN!…_ She stopped her train of thought. It was too dangerous for her to go their, and she really didn't want to anyways. Instead she reached with her free hand, and lightly pushed Shinji away form her. She turned her head to Tashigi still sitting quietly and patiently waiting for the Red-Heads answer.  
哇，这太不可思议了，他……他……！明日香暗自思忖，不！……她打断了自己的思绪。去那里对她来说太危险了，而且她本来也不想去。于是，她用空着的那只手轻轻推开了真嗣。她转头看向仍在安静耐心等待红发女孩回答的达斯琪。

_Mein Gott she is so lovely, Mother would be proud of her little girl_ Tashigi thought to himself, "Now Asuka please answer I do not have all day you realize"  
我的天，她真是太可爱了，母亲一定会为她的小女孩感到骄傲的。达斯琪心想，“现在，明日香，请回答我，你明白我没有整天的时间。”

"Yeah I get it" Asuka harsly shot back, "Fine tell your little tale I've got nothing else to do."  
“行了，我明白了。”明日香不耐烦地回击，“好吧，讲你的小故事吧，反正我也没别的事可做。”

Shinji chocked back a laugh, he remembered what happened last time she had "nothing else to do."  
真嗣强忍住笑意，他记得上次她说“没事可做”时发生了什么。

"Very well" Tashigi cleared his throat "my name Asuka, is Tashigi Heinrich Soryu" he explained slowly, "I am your older brother"  
“很好”，达斯琪清了清嗓子，“我叫明日香，是达斯琪·海因里希·索龙”，他缓缓解释道，“我是你的哥哥”。

Another silence fell upon the room. This was not as long as the last, as Asuka sat with her mouth agape. However, a few seconds later her body began to rock back and forth as she began to laugh. Her laughter filled the room for a few seconds before she finally composed herself,  
房间再次陷入沉默。这次没有上次那么久，因为明日香张着嘴坐在那里。然而，几秒钟后，她的身体开始前后摇晃，随即笑了起来。她的笑声在房间里回荡了几秒，直到她终于平静下来。

"Wow, wow. I've heard, and seen a lot of stuff in my life but that one takes the cake. Did Dumkopf over here put you up to this spast? That was a good one, I really needed a good laugh today!" Asuka continued to giggle  
"哇，哇。我这辈子听过的、见过的东西多了去了，但这个真是绝了。是这个笨蛋让你这么做的吗？这招真不错，我今天正需要好好笑一场呢！" 明日香继续咯咯笑着。

"Asuka I'm not kidding I'm being completely serious" Tashigi answered, shocked by Asuka's response.  
"明日香，我不是在开玩笑，我是认真的。" 达斯琪回答道，对明日香的反应感到震惊。

"Ok wow they must've paid you well, how much did you give him huh Third child? Is Misato in on this? Touji? Kensuke? Come on where's the hidden camera?" Asuka began to walk around the room, looking for a possible hidden camera that was hooked up.  
"好吧，他们一定给了你不少钱吧，你给了他多少，嗯？第三适格者？美里也参与了吗？东治？光司？快说，隐藏的摄像头在哪里？" 明日香开始在房间里四处走动，寻找可能安装的隐藏摄像头。

"Asuka he's not…" Shinji began only to be quickly interrupted by the young German.  
"明日香，他不是…" 真嗣刚开口就被那位年轻的德国少女迅速打断了。

"Ah stuff it Dumkopf! I know that you all are just playing a big trick on me. Well No one pulls the wool over Asuka Langelly Soryu's eyes. So tell me who is this guy really?"  
"啊，闭嘴，笨蛋！我知道你们都在跟我开一个大玩笑。哼，没人能蒙蔽我惣流·明日香·兰格雷的双眼。快告诉我，这家伙到底是谁？"

"Asuka, Sei ruhig!" Tashigi shouted, "now sit down and listen"  
"明日香，安静！" 达斯琪喊道，"现在坐下，听我说"

"Ok Ok. I'll go along with the joke" Asuka said as she sat down, once again placing her hand on Shinji's.  
"好吧好吧，我就顺着你的玩笑来吧。" 明日香说着坐了下来，再次把手放在了真嗣的手上。

"Asuka I'm not joking!" Tashigi replied now beginning to get annoyed by Asuka's blatant disregard for his statement  
"明日香，我不是在开玩笑！" 塔希吉回应道，开始对明日香对他的话明显无视感到恼火。

"Oh Please. I grew up an only child, besides your accent is 100 percent German." Her eyes narrowed as her voice lowered, "I'm half Japanese. There's no way we are related" Asuka said triumphantly.  
"哦，拜托。我是个独生女，而且你的口音百分之百是德国的。" 她的眼睛眯了起来，声音也低沉了，"我有一半日本血统。我们绝不可能有关系。" 明日香得意地说。

"Now listen to Me Asuka" Tashigi hissed, officially fed up with her attitude "The reason I have such a heavy Germanic accent is due to the fact I spent 14 years of my life growing up and being raised in Germany."  
"现在听我说，飞鸟。" 塔希吉低声说道，正式受够了她的态度，"我之所以有如此浓重的德语口音，是因为我在德国长大并生活了 14 年。"

"A typical response from a liar!" Asuka fired at him.  
"典型的骗子反应！" 飞鸟反击道。

"Asuka look at me do I look like I'm lying? Believe me if I was you'd know it. I'm terrible at it." Tashigi threw back at Asuka, immediately shutting her up like a clam.  
"飞鸟，看着我，我看起来像是在撒谎吗？相信我，如果我在撒谎，你肯定能看出来。我在这方面很糟糕。" 塔希吉反驳道，立刻让飞鸟像闭壳的蛤蜊一样沉默了。

"Now I figured I'd run into some resistance. That's why I brought this" Tashigi moved his hand into his jacket pocket.  
"现在我料到会遇到些阻力。这就是为什么我带了这个" 达吉吉将手伸进夹克口袋。

"What are you gonna do? Threaten us?" Asuka mockingly asked  
"你想干嘛？威胁我们吗？" 明日香嘲讽地问道

"No." Tashigi answered, "I'm going to show you this!" With that, Tashigi pulled a picture out of the pocket and showed it to Asuka and Shinji.  
"不。" 达吉吉回答，"我要给你们看这个！" 说着，达吉吉从口袋里掏出一张照片，展示给明日香和真嗣看。

"Look closely Asuka. Does anyone in this picture look familiar? Well it should, this is our family portrait. Taken when I was 13, notice anything about the adults?" Tashigi both explained and asked  
"仔细看，明日香。这张照片里的人有你熟悉的吗？应该有，这是我们的全家福。我 13 岁那年拍的，注意到大人们有什么特别之处了吗？" 塔希吉一边解释一边问道

"Oh pl…" she stopped as she closely examined the photo. Her smile immediately melted away and transformed into one of confusion and anger.  
"哦，拜托……" 她停下话语，仔细审视着照片。她的笑容立刻消失，转而变成了困惑和愤怒的表情。

"Yes look closely at it my dear. Those are our parents. Erik Mustan Soryu, and Akira Hatake Soryu. The boy in the left hand corner with the suit is me." Tashigi continued to explain.  
"是的，亲爱的，仔细看看。那是我们的父母，埃里克·穆斯坦·索吕和秋良·羽竹·索吕。左下角那个穿西装的男孩就是我。" 塔希吉继续解释道。

"Y-you, could have doctored this photo. I don't believe it! There's no way it's possible!" Asuka screamed  
"你—你，这照片可能是你篡改的。我才不信！这绝不可能！" 明日香尖叫道

"Oh but it is look closer at the picture." Tashigi commanded  
"哦，但事实就是如此，你再仔细看看这张照片。" 塔希吉命令道

Asuka reluctantly obeyed the instruction. Upon further inspection she noticed her mother's stomach was rather large.  
明日香不情愿地遵从了指示。仔细一看，她注意到她母亲的肚子异常地大。

"Momma was never heavy or out of shape. She was always very fit, and slender. This picture is a fake" Asuka declared  
"妈妈从不胖，也从未走形。她总是非常健康，身材苗条。这张照片是假的"，明日香断言道

"Asuka inspect the picture closer. This is indeed Mother, but you noticed her stomach. Look at the date on the picture" Tashigi pointed out, as Asuka turned the picture to it's back and read the imprinted date.  
"明日香更仔细地检查了照片。这确实是母亲，但你注意到了她的肚子。看看照片上的日期"，达斯琪指出，明日香将照片翻过来，读了印在上面的日期。

Tashigi drew on his cigarette again "I believe you'll find the date November 4th 2001. Mother was 8 months pregnant with you when the photo was shot."  
达斯琪再次吸了一口烟，"我相信你会发现日期是 2001 年 11 月 4 日。照片拍摄时，母亲已经怀你八个月了。"

"N-No I-I…" She couldn't finish as a small tear forced it's way out of the corner of her eye.  
"不，我……" 她哽咽着说不出话，一滴泪水不由自主地从眼角滑落。

"This can't be real. I won't believe it!" Asuka stayed in her stubborn state. As she said this she tried to get up and move away from Tashigi but felt a grip on her left hand.  
"这不可能是真的。我不会相信的！" 明日香依旧固执己见。当她说这话时，试图起身远离达斯琪，却感觉到左手被紧紧抓住。

"Asuka" Shinji finally spoke up after being quiet for so long. He too was growing weary of Asuka's constant rebutall's to her brothers statements. "Stay here, he's come a long way to see you. We can at least indulge him for a few minutes."  
"明日香" 真嗣终于在长时间的沉默后开口了。他对于明日香不断反驳她哥哥的话也感到疲惫。"留在这里，他远道而来见你。我们至少可以花几分钟听听他的话。"

"fine" Asuka spat "Get to the point Tashigi!"  
"好" 明日香啐了一口，"直奔主题，达斯琪！"

"Wundrebar" Tashigi answered, "now as I was saying. My name is Tashigi Heinrich Soryu I was born December 12th 1987. I am the son of Erik **(A/N: Thanks to Lord Talon for the name by the way)** Mustan Soryu and Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu."  
"棒极了" 达斯琪回答道，"那么正如我所说，我的名字是达斯琪·海因里希·索隆，出生于 1987 年 12 月 12 日。我是埃里克（作者注：感谢 Lord Talon 提供的名字）·穆斯坦·索隆和京子·齐柏林·索隆的儿子。"

"yes we know all that already. You're just being a big waste of time, if you're not gonna give us anything else, then you might as well get the…" Asuka ranted only to be interrupted by Tashigi once again.  
""是的，这些我们都知道了。你只是在浪费大家的时间，如果你不打算告诉我们别的，那你还是……" 明日香正发着牢骚，却被达斯琪再次打断。

"Please my dear little sister, let me continue. I was born in Munich Germany, and lived there with my mother and father for 14 years. All of which were spent training for me to take a position at NERV, when I graduated from High School. So most of my schooling placed heavy emphasis on History, Georgraphy, Meterology, and the sciences in General. I had very little time to be just a kid, a lot of pressure was put on me to become the next in the long line of Soryu's as a commander of the German branch at NERV." Tashigi's explanation, was cut short by Asuka once again.  
"求你了，亲爱的小妹妹，让我继续说下去。我出生在德国慕尼黑，和我的父母在那里生活了 14 年。这些年我都在为高中毕业后进入 NERV 担任职位而接受训练。因此，我的学业重点放在了历史、地理、气象学以及一般科学上。我几乎没有时间像个普通孩子那样生活，巨大的压力迫使我成为索龙家族中下一任德国 NERV 分部的指挥官。" 然而，Tashigi 的解释再次被 Asuka 打断了。

"Oh how sad" she replied sarcastically "What did you come here for a shoulder to cry on or something?"  
"哦，真可怜" 她讽刺地回答道，"你来这儿是为了找个肩膀哭泣吗？"

"No Asuka" Tashigi said, "I am simply here to explain who I am and why I am here. Now please let me continue. After my time in middle school was up I was immediately bounced up, much like you Asuka, to the level of High school. However, I never attended. Father sent me away, to a site called Tokyo-3 the new capital of Japan. I was to go and work for a recently formed government agency called GEHIRN. When I reached the capital I was immediately transported to the clean up crews on the shore." Tashigi was about to continue when, this time, Shinji spoke up  
"没有 Asuka，" Tashigi 说道，"我只是来解释我是谁以及我为什么在这里。现在请让我继续。中学毕业后，我立刻被提升，就像你 Asuka 一样，到了高中水平。然而，我从未去上过。父亲把我送走了，去了一个叫东京-3 的新首都日本。我被派去为一个新成立的政府机构工作，叫做 GEHIRN。当我到达首都时，我立即被送往海岸的清理队伍。" Tashigi 正要继续，这时，Shinji 开口了

"clean up crews?" He asked  
"清理队伍？" 他问道

"Yes Shinji. You see after second impact there was a lot of how you say, nuclear fallout. The Government, fearing that the water had been contaminated sent us to inspect." Tashigi explained  
"是的 Shinji。你看，第二次冲击后，有很多，怎么说呢，核辐射。政府担心水被污染了，就派我们去检查。" Tashigi 解释道

"So that explains the…" Shinji said, then pointed his two fingers at his own eyes.  
"所以这就是解释了……" 真嗣说道，然后用两根手指指向自己的眼睛。

"Nein" Tashigi said "that does not explain my 'affliction' so to speak, that is a separate subject altogether." Clearing his throat, and dragging on his cigarette again, he continued his tale  
""不" 塔希吉说，"这并不能解释我的所谓'困扰'，那是完全不同的议题。" 他清了清嗓子，再次抽了一口烟，继续讲述他的故事。

"I was not in any real direct contact with the water. My job was on the analysis team. We spent all of 9 months analyzing small amounts of water for 24 hours a day. The pay was lousy, they gave us no place to live, and the sewege run-of from the combinations of chemicals and water made the lab smell so bad I would become ill everyday." Tashigi squinted, slightly grimacing at the horrible memories.  
""我并没有直接接触到水。我的工作是在分析团队。我们花了整整 9 个月的时间，每天 24 小时分析少量的水。报酬微薄，他们没有提供住处，而化学物质与水的混合物产生的废水让实验室的气味如此难闻，以至于我每天都会感到不适。" 塔希吉眯起眼睛，略带痛苦地回忆起那些糟糕的记忆。

"After a month I was ready to quit, but knowing father I decided to stay on. It was during this time that I received a letter from father demanding that I return to Munich immediately. Mother was in the hospital." A smile formed on his lips now conjuring up a more happy memory.  
"一个月后，我本打算放弃，但考虑到父亲的脾气，我决定留下来。就在那时，我收到了父亲的一封信，要求我立即返回慕尼黑。母亲住院了。" 他的嘴角浮现出一丝微笑，唤起了更快乐的回忆。

"When I got to Munich hospital, Mother was in bed. I looked to a small bundle wrapped in her arms. Do you know what it was Asuka?" Tashigi's smile grew wider  
"当我赶到慕尼黑医院时，母亲躺在床上。我看到她怀里抱着一个小小的包裹。你知道那是什么吗，飞鸟？" 达西吉的笑容更加灿烂了。

"It was you" Tashigi answered, "I remember how happy I was, that I was a big brother. Immediately I knew that you'd grow up into a beautiful young lady. Obviously I greatly underestimated you. I promised that I'd stay until you grew up, and would make sure that you had the childhood that I never got. I wasn't going to let father turn you into another dog for the state (**A/N: Full Metal reference woo-hoo!)**. I had lost my childhood, and I was going to make sure yours was as pleasant as possible. The doctors told me, that you and Mother needed your rest so I had to leave. However, I was so excited I went out and bought you a small birthday gift. I had very little money as I said, but luckily mother had persuaded father to let me stay at home. Father, was in no mood to see me so he gave me this ultimatum, I could stay at the house until I was contacted by GEHIRN in Tokyo-3. As soon as that happened I was to return. I figured I'd get to spend at least a few days at home and with you." His smile faded quickly,  
“是你。”达斯琪回答道，“我记得当时我有多高兴，因为我成了大哥。我立刻就知道，你会长成一个美丽的少女。显然，我大大低估了你。我承诺过会等到你长大，确保你拥有我从未有过的童年。我不会让父亲把你变成国家的另一条走狗（注：《钢之炼金术师》梗，耶！）。我失去了自己的童年，我要确保你的尽可能愉快。医生告诉我，你和母亲需要休息，所以我必须离开。然而，我太兴奋了，还是出去给你买了份小生日礼物。如我所说，我没什么钱，但幸好母亲说服了父亲让我留在家中。父亲那时不想见我，于是给了我这个最后通牒：我可以留在家里，直到东京-3 的 GEHIRN 联系我。一旦联系上，我就得回去。我想，至少能在家和你共度几天。”他的笑容迅速消失。

"That same night, I got a notice from our head researcher. I was to return to Tokyo-3 immediately, a new Director was being named for the agency and also our research group was getting a new team leader. The new director was sending a private chopper to pick me up. I was so depressed, here I was, seeing you for the first time and hoping that, for at least a few months, I could watch you continue to grow into a woman. My duties carried me away though, and I was obligated to follow. So that night, I walked into your room, and placed the gift, on your dresser. I remember placing a small kiss on your head, and then leaving for the Chopper."  
"就在那个夜晚，我收到了首席研究员的通知。我必须立即返回第三新东京市，机构将任命一位新主任，同时我们的研究小组也将迎来新的团队领导。新主任派了一架私人直升机来接我。我感到非常沮丧，刚刚与你重逢，本希望至少在接下来的几个月里，能亲眼见证你成长为一名女性。然而职责所在，我不得不离开。于是那晚，我走进你的房间，将礼物放在你的梳妆台上。我记得轻轻吻了吻你的额头，然后便前往直升机。"

"What'd you get me? I bet you don't even remember because this whole thing sounds highly suspect." Asuka responded arrogantly, slightly tightening her grip on Shinji's hand.  
"你送了我什么？我打赌你连这都不记得了，听起来整个事情就很可疑。" 明日香傲慢地回应，同时稍稍握紧了真嗣的手。

"No Asuka I remember well. I saw a red watch in a jewelry store, it was within my price range so I went in and bought it. I explicitly instructed Mother to give that to you when you were old enough to have it. So around the time you were 13 years old. But I digress." He dragged on his cigarette again.  
"不，明日香，我记得很清楚。我在一家珠宝店看到一块红色的手表，价格在我能承受的范围内，所以我就进去买了下来。我特意嘱咐母亲，等你长大到适合佩戴时再给你。大概是你 13 岁左右的时候。不过，这些都不重要了。" 他再次深深吸了一口烟。

"I returned to Tokyo-3. When I arrived the entire GEHIRN team was brought to an underground facility. Now when I say the entire GEHIRN Team I mean everyone from the higher-ups, to the janitors. After a painfully long ceremony, the new appointees were finally introduced. The new Director was Gendo Ikari, and his wife was our new team leader. Yui Ikari." Shinji blanched  
"我回到了第三新东京市。抵达时，整个 GEHIRN 团队都被带到了一个地下设施。现在，当我说整个 GEHIRN 团队时，我的意思是包括高层到清洁工在内的每一个人。经过一个漫长而痛苦的仪式后，新任命的人员终于被介绍出来。新任局长是源堂元帅，而他的妻子成为了我们的新团队领导。源堂唯。" 真嗣脸色苍白

"Yes Shinji, I knew your mother. I can tell you with the upmost honesty I never met a more pleasant woman in my life. For the next 3 months of my time with the clean up crews Yui and I became very close friends." His smile reappeared on his lips  
"是的，真嗣，我认识你的母亲。我可以非常诚实地告诉你，我一生中从未遇到过比她更令人愉快的女性。在接下来的三个月里，我和清理队伍在一起的时间里，我和唯成为了非常亲密的朋友。" 他的笑容再次出现在唇边

"Naturally being team leader Yui quickly learned about our poor living conditions and lousy salary. Yui though she felt sorry for us felt that there was nothing she could do to make things improve. However, she helped me out quite a bit, and even promoted me to her right hand man."  
"作为团队领导，唯很快就了解了我们糟糕的生活条件和微薄的薪水。尽管唯对我们感到同情，但她觉得没有什么办法可以改善现状。然而，她确实帮了我很多忙，甚至提拔我成为她的得力助手。"

"Mom must've been really fond of you Tashigi" Shinji's voice was more creaky than a rusty doorknob.  
"妈妈一定非常喜欢你，达斯琪。" 真嗣的声音比生锈的门把手还要沙哑。

"She was Shinji. And I was of her, she was almost like a mother for me since my mother left me alone." Tashigi cheerily responded, trying to lighten the mood. "But now back to the rest of this ordeal."  
"她确实是，真嗣。我也非常喜欢她，自从我母亲离开我后，她几乎就像我的母亲一样。" 达斯琪愉快地回应，试图缓和气氛。"但现在让我们回到这场磨难的其余部分吧。"

"It was at this time my body began to deteriorate. I had lost almost 25 pounds by this time since I could afford very little food, and my health became a very serious issue."  
"就在那时，我的身体开始恶化。由于我几乎买不起什么食物，到那时我已经瘦了将近 25 磅，我的健康状况成了一个非常严重的问题。"

"Wait a second Tashigi." Shinji broke in, "You said you had no direct contact with the water, and yet you were in bad health? How did that work?"  
"等一下，达斯吉。" 真嗣插话道，"你说你没有直接接触水，但你的健康状况却很糟糕？这是怎么回事？"

"Well my friend," Tashigi replied, now putting out the cigarette which was now a mere butt, "It's simple. The ventilation in the lab was poor, and as such I was subjected to the hazardous gasses that the chemicals produced more than anyone. Since I was malnourished, the hazardous materials were able to attack my immune system rather harsly and quickly. Plus my sleep deprivation didn't exactly help my condition. Finally, One day it became too much. I was running some regular tests when I began to cough. The next thing I knew I was stumbling around the lab, after that I fell into a cough fit and finally hit the floor. The next thing I remember, was vomiting uncontrollably over everything in the lab. The final thing I remember was I hit the floor retching, having a hard time breathing, and spasming uncontrollably. Luckily, my assistants were able to get a hold of Yui, who took me to the nearest hospital."  
"嗯，我的朋友，" 达斯吉回答道，现在把那支已经烧到尽头的香烟熄灭，"很简单。实验室的通风很差，因此我比任何人都更多地暴露在化学品产生的危险气体中。由于我营养不良，这些有害物质能够相当严厉和迅速地攻击我的免疫系统。再加上我的睡眠不足，这无疑加剧了我的状况。最终，有一天我实在承受不住了。当时我正在做一些常规测试，突然开始咳嗽。接下来我只记得自己在实验室里踉跄，然后就倒在地上，开始剧烈咳嗽。再后来，我记得自己无法控制地呕吐，把实验室里的一切都弄脏了。最后，我倒在地上，呼吸困难，身体不受控制地抽搐。幸运的是，我的助手们及时联系到了由依，她把我送到了最近的医院。"

"Does this story ever end?" Asuka complained, now becoming very impatient with their Golden Eyed Visitor.  
"这个故事到底有没有个完？" 明日香抱怨道，对这位金眼访客的不耐烦已经到了极点。

"Why Asuka? I haven't seen you in almost 14 years, is it too much to ask for me to spend time with my little sister?" Tashigi smirked  
"为什么是明日香？我快 14 年没见你了，难道要求和我的小妹妹共度时光也过分吗？" 达斯琪坏笑道

"YOU ARE NOT MY BROTHER! I don't care what you say, there is nothing that could make me believe that I am even closely related to you!" Asuka growled  
"你不是我哥哥！不管你说什么，我都不会相信我和你有任何关系！" 明日香咆哮道

"I'll take that as a sign to continue my story. Well, where did I leave off?" Tashigi asked, rubbing the back of his head  
"那我就当作是继续讲故事的信号了。嗯，我讲到哪儿了？" 达斯琪问道，一边揉着后脑勺

"Hospital" Shinji simply replied  
"医院" 真嗣简单地回答道

"Ah yes of course. Thank you" Tashigi cleared his throat once again, "So The next thing I knew I woke up in a hospital bed. I had tubes in my nose to aid my breathing and I was hooked up to a machine to monitor my heart rate. As I was recounting the events that lead to my current state, the doctor entered the room. Now, as you may have guessed not a lot of NERV staff were equipped to handle sick employee's. Luckily I was treated by their best, as per the request of Yui, and as such Dr. Akagi was the person who gave me treatment."  
"啊，当然。谢谢你" 塔希吉再次清了清喉咙，"接下来我所知道的是，我醒来时躺在医院的床上。我的鼻子里插着管子帮助呼吸，身上连接着一台监测心率的机器。当我正在回忆导致我目前状况的事件时，医生走进了房间。现在，你可能已经猜到了，NERV 的工作人员中没有多少人具备处理生病员工的能力。幸运的是，根据唯的请求，我得到了他们最好的治疗，因此是赤木博士为我进行了治疗。"

"Wait Ristuko…." Shinji began,  
"等等，Ristuko……" 真嗣开始说道，

"Nein, not Ristuko" Tashigi interrupted, "Her mother treated me until I was back to full strength. Now I could not say much for her bedside manor, but she definitely knew her stuff. Anyways in about a week I was released from the hospital and was ready to return to work."  
"不，不是利斯库" 塔希吉打断道，"她的母亲一直照顾我，直到我完全康复。虽然她的床边态度我不敢恭维，但她的医术确实了得。总之，大约一周后我就出院了，准备重返工作岗位。

"Wait so you're telling me that in just a week you were able to recover from blood poisoning? Highly suspect if you ask me" Asuka shouted  
""等等，你是说你只用了一周时间就从血液中毒中恢复过来了？要我说，这太可疑了" 明日香大声说道

"Asuka, I was a young man, and was finally getting enough nourishment that my system was able to flush the virus rather quickly. Anyways getting back to where I was…" Tashigi continued, however, suddenly a loud banging was heard at the door.  
""明日香，我当时年轻力壮，而且终于得到了足够的营养，我的身体能够迅速清除病毒。不管怎样，回到我刚才的话题……" 塔希吉继续说道，但突然，门外传来了一阵急促的敲门声。

"Hello! No Pen-Pen not now! Shinji? Asuka? You home? Come on for five seconds stop the makeout session, and answer me!" Misato shouted from the doorway.  
"你好！不，Pen-Pen，现在不行！真嗣？明日香？你们在家吗？拜托，五秒钟，暂停你们的亲热，回答我！" 美里在门口大声喊道。

"MISATO SHUT UP!" Both of the charges barked at their guardian their faces tomato red.  
"美里，闭嘴！" 两个被监护人同时朝他们的监护人吼道，脸红得像番茄一样。

"Come on you know you've thought about it" Misato replied teasingly  
"得了吧，你知道你也曾想过" 美里调皮地回应道。

"We have not!" the 2 teen answered emphatically in perfect unison  
"我们没有！"两个少年异口同声地坚决回答

_Oh But you most certainly have Asuka_ Tashigi thought as he continued to gaze at his little sister.  
"哦，但你们确实有了。"浅木飞鸟边想边继续凝视着他的妹妹。

Asuka caught his eyes, and began to get even more upset.  
飞鸟对上了他的目光，开始变得更加不安。

"STOP IT!" Asuka yelled at the top of her lungs. "YOU ARE SUCH A CREEP!"  
"住手！" 明日香声嘶力竭地喊道，"你真是个变态！"

"Ugh Asuka again with this attitude?" Mistao said as she walked, well more stumbled into the room, carrying bags of veggies, meat, and (of course) beer.  
"哎，明日香又来这套态度？" 美里边说边走进房间，与其说是走，不如说是踉跄着进来，手里提着装满蔬菜、肉类和（当然少不了的）啤酒的袋子。

"honestly you think that just once…" Misato began to lecture but was cut off as her eyes met with a pair of gold ones.  
"说真的，你就不能有一次……" 美里正要开始说教，但当她的目光与一双金色的眼睛相遇时，话被打断了。

"T…T…T…. Tashigi. B-but, how? It's been…" Misato stuttered  
"T…T…T…. 塔希吉。但，但是，怎么可能？已经……" 三里透结巴地说道

"12 years 5 months, 16 days, 12 minutes, and exactly 52 seconds" Tashigi smugly finished the purple haired woman's sentence.  
"12 年 5 个月，16 天，12 分钟，以及确切的 52 秒" 塔希吉得意地替紫发女子完成了这句话。

"So Katsuragi, I must know how you have kept up your looks after all this time"  
"那么，葛城，我必须知道你是如何在这么长时间后还能保持容颜的"
