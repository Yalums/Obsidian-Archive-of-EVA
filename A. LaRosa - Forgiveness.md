**Disclaimer**: I own absolutely own nothing.  
免责声明：我绝对不拥有任何东西。

**Author's Note:** I am combining what happened in the manga and the movie, so even if you haven't seen one, the other would suffice since you can imagine the setting. I also do not own Neon Genesis Evangelion. This was written for the Springkink community on LiveJournal under the prompt of: Comfort, forgiveness; masturbation - seeking a form of redemption.  
作者的话：我结合了漫画和电影中的情节，所以即使你没看过其中一部，另一部也足以让你想象出背景。我也不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。这篇作品是为 LiveJournal 上的 Springkink 社区所写，主题是：安慰、宽恕；自慰——寻求一种救赎的形式。

**Warnings**: As the prompt states, there is masturbation inside in a situation one could possibly conclude as rape (which was pointed out to me), but if you know the story you may think otherwise.  
警告：如提示所述，文中包含自慰情节，在某种情况下可能被视为强奸（有人向我指出），但如果你了解故事，可能会有不同的看法。

Forgiveness 宽恕  
_March 2, 2010 2010 年 3 月 2 日_

---

Shinji had been attempting to cook dinner. Cooking eased the ever-worry that plagued his mind. He, at least, was in a better state than Asuka. They were both hurting, but she was taking it with more force. This wasn't new.  
真嗣一直在尝试做晚饭。烹饪能缓解他心中挥之不去的忧虑。至少，他现在的状态比明日香要好。他们都受到了伤害，但她承受得更为强烈。这并不新鲜。

She had come into the room, silently enough that he couldn't hear her enter over the bubbling of the water as it boiled. When she spoke, he jumped, whirling around to meet her steel gaze.  
她悄无声息地走进房间，以至于他在水沸腾的咕嘟声中没有听到她的进入。当她开口时，他吓了一跳，转身迎上了她坚定的目光。

"I want to see you do it," she had said. He didn't question the look on her face, only the motive behind her words.  
"我想看你做那件事，"她曾说。他没有质疑她脸上的表情，只怀疑她话语背后的动机。

"See me do… what?" he asked.  
"看我做……什么？" 他问道。

She lowered her voice. "I remember when you did it. My eyes were open, weren't they? When I thrashed around, did it turn you on even more?"  
她压低了声音。"我记得你做那件事的时候。我的眼睛是睁开的，对吧？当我挣扎时，是不是让你更兴奋了？

"Where is this coming from?" Shinji knew exactly what she was alluding to. "Asuka, you can't be serious—"  
"这是从哪儿冒出来的？" 真嗣清楚她指的是什么。"明日香，你不是认真的吧——"

"Did I just speak in German, Third? I want to see it. See you do it." She was the personification of defiance, hands on her hips, eyebrows furrowed.  
"我刚才是用德语说的吗，第三？我想看看。看你做出来。" 她双手叉腰，眉头紧锁，一副挑衅的模样。

Shinji tried to backpedal as fast as he could. "You can't… you're making fun of me. Sometimes I just can't help what—"  
真嗣试图尽快打圆场。"你不能……你在取笑我。有时候我就是控制不住自己——"

She sat down at the kitchen table. "Did I say 'reason your way out of this' or did I tell you to be a man and own up to your actions? Come on, Third. Or… do you only get hot when you think about the First?"  
她坐在厨房的桌子旁。“我是说‘找理由脱身’还是让你像个男人一样承担起你的行为？快点，Third。还是说……你只有在想到 First 的时候才会兴奋？”

He hissed as he leaned back a bit too far and touched the hot stove. "That's a lie!" Cursing softly to himself, he put his finger in his mouth to dull the throbbing. He shut off the stove. Nothing would get cooked, much less eaten, for a while.  
他向后仰得太过，碰到了热炉子，不禁倒吸一口凉气。“那是骗人的！”他低声咒骂着，将手指放进嘴里以缓解疼痛。他关掉了炉子。什么都不会被烹饪，更别提被吃掉了，暂时如此。

An extended lapse of silence had passed. "Well?"  
一段长时间的沉默过去了。“那么？”

He pulled his finger out of his mouth, trying to plead with his eyes rather than with his words. When that failed, her expression unchanging, he asked, "But why?"  
他抽出手指，试图用眼神而非言语恳求。然而，她的表情毫无变化，他只好问道：“但为什么？”

"Why? Don't question me," she snapped. "Are you questioning me?"  
“为什么？别问我，”她厉声道，“你在质疑我吗？”

If he was going to go down, he might as well do it with guns blazing. "Then you do it, too! Why the hell should I be the one on display?"  
如果他注定要失败，那还不如轰轰烈烈地面对。“那你也要做！凭什么我得是那个被展示的？”

"What gives you the right to demand seeing me doing that?" she screeched. She slammed the palms of her hands on the wooden table for emphasis, looking as if she were about to stand up but making no move to.  
"你凭什么要求看我做那种事？" 她尖叫道。她用力将手掌拍在木桌上以示强调，看起来像是要站起来，却没有任何动作。

He tried to retort, "What gives _you_ the right—"  
他试图反驳，"你凭什么——"

"Were you lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to various machines, only to have a friend of yours, someone you believed to have some semblance of a relationship with—good _or_ bad—come in and masturbate to you when they see a little flesh? I go around this apartment wearing a hell of a lot less than I did at that time. You see me come out of the shower how much?  
"如果你躺在医院病床上，身上连着各种仪器，而你的一个朋友，你以为与你有某种关系——不管是好是坏——进来看到你露出的皮肤就自慰，你会怎么想？我在这公寓里穿的比那时少多了。你见过我洗完澡出来多少次？

"Was it because you actually saw my breasts? Did that finally push you over the edge? Did you lurk in my bedroom at night when I was asleep and defile me while I was unknowing and unconscious? Does that get you off? No, you don't have that much of a spine. Maybe it was because I couldn't fight back, couldn't shut you down, or knock you out of your pubescent stupor before your hand rubbed your dick so raw you had the gall to cry when you were done. Did it hurt?  
"是因为你真的看到了我的胸部吗？那是否终于让你越过了底线？你是不是在我熟睡时潜入我的卧室，趁我无知无觉时侵犯了我？这让你兴奋吗？不，你没有那么大的胆量。或许是因为我无法反抗，无法让你清醒，或者在你那青春期的迷糊中，你的手摩擦得那么厉害，以至于事后你还有脸哭。疼吗？

"You know what pains me more than you making a mess all over yourself because of me? The fact that you can't be a man and own up to it. So that's what I'm saying to you now."  
"你知道什么比你自己因为我而搞得一团糟更让我痛苦吗？是你不能像个男人一样承担责任。所以我现在要对你说的就是这些。"

Shinji swallowed thickly. He was torn between what should've been his jerk response and what he owed her. He knew that his past actions were demeaning, and that this was an equivalent exchange, but… how could this solve what the past complicated? It was something that she wanted from him. He couldn't deny her. Did she know that? She probably did, which is why she was there, sitting so strongly, so sure and confident, at the kitchen table with those eyes trained on him as if he were the only thing in existence on the planet. He may have been.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。他陷入了两难，一方面是应该有的混蛋反应，另一方面是他欠她的。他知道自己的过去行为是贬低人的，而这是等价交换，但是……这怎么能解决过去复杂的问题呢？这是她想要的。他不能拒绝她。她知道吗？她很可能知道，这就是为什么她坐在那里，那么坚定，那么自信，厨房桌旁，眼睛紧盯着他，仿佛他是地球上唯一的存在。他可能就是。

He swallowed thickly. "I see your… I see your point."  
他艰难地咽了咽口水。“我明白你的……我明白你的意思。”

"And you're still going to fight me?"  
“那你还是要和我对抗吗？”

"I'm sorry," he said weakly. He mumbled his apology a few times after that. Was he apologizing for fighting her demands or that he had done the action in the first place?  
“对不起，”他无力地说道。之后他又含糊地道歉了几次。他是在为对抗她的要求道歉，还是为一开始就采取了行动而道歉呢？

"Don't fucking start, Third," she warned. She sized him up and down, planning the best way of attack. "Come here," she demanded.  
"别他妈的开始，老三，" 她警告道。她上下打量着他，盘算着最佳的攻击方式。"过来，" 她命令道。

He stepped forward, knowing that prolonging the inevitable would hurt him more. She could have gotten anything she wanted from him, anything at all, but she wanted this?  
他向前迈了一步，知道拖延不可避免只会让自己更痛苦。她本可以从他那里得到任何想要的东西，任何东西，但她偏偏要这个？

He had a weak spot for that face, as sad and masochistic as it was—the fact that he had a weak spot, not her face. Maybe, even, her face; any happiness that flittered across her it was usually at the expense of someone else. Had he ever genuinely seen her smile? Why was he doing this for her?  
他对那张脸有着难以抗拒的弱点，尽管那表情既悲伤又自虐——他的弱点在于自己有这个弱点，而非她的脸。或许，甚至包括她的脸；她脸上闪过的任何快乐，通常都是以牺牲他人为代价的。他真的见过她由衷地微笑吗？他为什么要为她这么做？

If anyone felt the need to ask for a reason he cared so much, he wouldn't be able to give one.  
如果有人觉得有必要问他为什么如此在意，他无法给出一个答案。

In the middle of his mental volley, Asuka's hands had reached out to unbuckle his belt. The sharp tug that forced him closer to her snapped Shinji out of his reverie.  
在他的内心交战之中，明日香的手已经伸出去解开了他的腰带。那猛地一拉让他更靠近她，这让真嗣从沉思中惊醒。

"Asuka," he said weakly. If he could get her to stop, maybe…  
“明日香，”他无力地说道。如果他能让她停下来，也许……

He was ignored. 他被忽视了。

The belt pushed aside as she went to unbutton his pants. He was already twitching to life underneath the restraints of fabric and she wasn't surprised. He was surprised at his body's betrayal.  
她解开他的裤子时，皮带被推到一旁。他已经在布料的束缚下开始有了反应，她并不感到意外。他对自己身体的背叛感到惊讶。

"Asuka! Please!" “明日香！请！”

She responded to begging. "Please what?" She was giving him a chance?  
她回应了他的恳求。“请什么？”她这是在给他机会吗？

"Stop this!" “住手！”

She spared him a roll of her eyes. "Shut up, Third. Would you really feel like a man if the Stooges found out that you chickened out?" When he refused to respond, she laughed, a harsh echo in the silence of the kitchen.  
她白了他一眼。“闭嘴，老三。要是斯图格斯知道你临阵退缩，你真会觉得像个男人吗？”他拒绝回应，她便笑了，笑声在厨房的寂静中显得格外刺耳。

Asuka tugged his pants and underwear past his hips and to his knees, sparing formality and pretense. She could have been doing something as boring as reading a magazine, for all he knew, with that expression on her face. Despite his better intentions, the proximity of Asuka to his erection was enough to push his mind to even dirtier thoughts. They were in the kitchen, dammit! Couldn't any place in this apartment be sacred?  
明日香将他的裤子和内裤拉到臀部以下，直至膝盖，省去了所有的礼节和伪装。她脸上的表情，仿佛只是在无聊地翻阅一本杂志，至于她在做什么，他一无所知。尽管他本意良善，但明日香与他勃起的私密部位如此接近，足以让他的思绪飘向更为淫秽的想象。他们可是在厨房啊！这间公寓里难道就没有一处是神圣的吗？

He could have hallucinated the small noise of appreciation—something positive, at least—coming from the back of Asuka's throat as she sat back in the chair, regarding his vulnerability with a languid drag of a stare. He almost questioned if she had been in this situation before, but pushed that thought back into the 'don't give a shit' part of his brain where many problems had been filed lately. Only the basic needs and instincts remained.  
他几乎以为自己幻听了，明日香喉咙深处发出的一声微弱的赞赏——至少是正面的声音——当她坐回椅子上，用慵懒的目光审视着他的脆弱。他几乎要质疑她是否曾处于类似情境，但还是将这个念头推回到了他大脑中那个“毫不在乎”的区域，那里最近存放了许多问题。只剩下基本的需要和本能。

"Do you have to… face me? Can't you turn around at least?"  
“你非得……面对着我吗？至少不能转过身去吗？”

"Heavy breathing does nothing for me, Ikari. What're you waiting for? Fourth Impact?"  
"沉重的呼吸对我毫无作用，碇。你在等什么？第四次冲击吗？"

His eyes widened and he pointed, as if he wasn't entirely exposed in front of her. "You're getting off on—"  
他的眼睛睁大了，他指着她，仿佛自己并没有完全暴露在她面前。"你在从中得到快感——"

"Finish your sentence and I'm going to take that knife on the counter and—"  
"把话说完，我就拿那把刀——"

He quieted as she trailed off in the middle of her threat. Taking a deep breath, he brought a hand down to hold his erection. At this point in his life, he figured that he would be dead before any sexual situation involving Asuka presented itself. He should be glad to be alive.  
她威胁的话说到一半就停了下来，他随之安静下来。深吸一口气，他伸手握住了自己的勃起。在他这个年纪，他本以为自己会在与明日香有关的任何性场景出现之前就死去。他应该庆幸自己还活着。

Asuka had her chin resting in the palm of her hand, elbow planted on the table. She tried to make herself look uninterested. She should have made him take off his shirt so she could see his nipples this time around. Shinji hardly noticed her perverted eyes trailing down his body as he moved his hand slowly back and forth, curling underneath his shaft, his eyes slipping shut. He had built up a decent rhythm, pushing himself to perform in front of her. It shouldn't have been this easy. He spat in his dominant hand for lubrication before continuing with more zeal.  
明日香将下巴搁在手掌上，手肘撑在桌子上。她试图让自己看起来不感兴趣。这次她本该让他脱掉衬衫，好让她看看他的乳头。真嗣几乎没有注意到她那双色眯眯的眼睛顺着他的身体往下看，因为他正慢慢地来回移动手，卷曲在阴茎下方，眼睛渐渐闭上。他已经建立了一个不错的节奏，逼迫自己在她面前表现。这本不该这么容易。他在主导的手上吐了口唾沫以作润滑，然后更加热情地继续。

"Open your eyes," she said once the sound of his breathing in the silence was cutting through her. "Look at me."  
“睁开眼睛，”她在寂静中听到他的呼吸声时说道，“看着我。”

Shinji opened his eyes slowly, not fully, but open enough to satisfy her request. She had pushed a strap of her tank top off of her shoulder and pretended not to notice at first. That shift was different from when he had closed his eyes. She was teasing him, he knew; especially when she told him that the lure of her breasts would probably help him come faster. They would, but he couldn't bring himself to look at the swell of her breasts as he moved his hand at a surer pace. He knew what he liked.  
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，虽未完全睁开，但已足够满足她的要求。她将背心的肩带推下肩膀，假装起初没有注意到。这一变化与之前他闭眼时不同。他知道她在逗弄他，尤其是当她告诉他，她胸部的诱惑可能会让他更快达到高潮时。确实会，但他无法让自己在加快手速时直视她胸部的隆起。他知道自己喜欢什么。

It didn't hurt to have a living fantasy right in front of him.  
眼前有个活生生的幻想，这并不痛苦。

His eyes were locked on Asuka's. The paradox of her eyes, fiery yet ice cold, urged every jerking movement to be stronger, more forceful. Her gaze didn't waver, nor did she look away in embarrassment. For once she wasn't looking through him, but directly at him. The need in her eyes sent a jolt of what felt like electricity through him as his hips jerked on their own accord. She was goading him on with unspoken words. In an altogether familiar motion, he shuddered as he came, a strangled moan coming from deep within him being let loose so openly. It happened faster than it usually took him to get off, but he was pleased that he actually managed to succeed. He could have been shocked that he came so easily under Asuka's watchful eye, but the fact that he made any noise surprised him the most. He didn't notice the smile on Asuka's face until she threw a towel at him to clean up the "pathetic mess" that he had made.  
他的目光紧紧锁定在明日香身上。她眼中那火热的矛盾，炽烈却又冰冷，催促着每一次抽搐都更加强烈、更有力。她的视线未曾动摇，也没有因尴尬而移开。这一次，她没有透过他看向别处，而是直直地注视着他。她眼中的渴望如电流般贯穿他，令他的臀部不由自主地抽动。她用无声的话语挑逗着他。以一种再熟悉不过的动作，他颤抖着达到了高潮，一声压抑的呻吟从深处释放，如此坦然。这一切发生得比平时快得多，但他庆幸自己真的成功了。他本可能因在明日香的注视下如此轻易达到高潮而感到震惊，但最让他惊讶的是，他竟然发出了声音。直到明日香扔给他一条毛巾清理那“可悲的狼藉”时，他才注意到她脸上的微笑。

After he had gotten most of the mess out of the way, he pulled his pants back up. He would deal with the laundry later when she wasn't there. Asuka stood, stepping towards him so that he couldn't see anything but her—as if he would look anywhere else now. Her eyes were impossibly close but too far away.  
在他把大部分混乱清理干净后，他重新提上了裤子。等她不在的时候，他会处理这些脏衣服。明日香站起身，向他走去，让他只能看到她——仿佛他现在还会看向别处似的。她的眼睛近在咫尺，却又遥不可及。

"I forgive you, you know," she said.  
“我知道，我原谅你了。”她说。

"I was asking for forgiveness? By doing that? I can't believe… I can't… how could I possibly do that in front of you and still be alive? What kind of sick… twisted…? I've been through how much shit and _that_ made me think…" He sighed. "This whole situation is so fucked up I don't even know where to begin rationalizing. I just want to know. Why?"  
“我是在请求原谅吗？通过那样做？我简直不敢相信……我怎么可能……在你面前做出那种事还能活下来？这是什么样的病态……扭曲……？我经历了那么多狗屎事，那让我以为……”他叹了口气。“整个情况都他妈的乱套了，我甚至不知道从哪里开始理性分析。我只想知道。为什么？”

Asuka smiled in a way that showed no threats. His breath caught in his throat. She sucked her bottom lip into her mouth, dragging her teeth lightly across it. Her tongue followed the path of her teeth. She shrugged. "I wanted to see how far you'd go. We'll continue when I think you're ready." She stood, finishing the job of buttoning and buckling his pants for him before turning to exit. "Get moving with dinner."  
明日香露出了一个毫无威胁的微笑。他屏住了呼吸。她将下唇吸入口中，轻轻地用牙齿刮过。舌头紧随其后，沿着牙齿的路径。她耸了耸肩。“我想看看你能走多远。等我觉得你准备好了，我们再继续。”她站起身，帮他扣好并系紧裤子的扣子，然后转身离开。“去准备晚饭吧。”
