**School 学校**

Traditionally, each class cleaned up a part of the school. Mostly their classrooms, but also the common areas, and class 2-A did not stand out in this regard. Less than a third of the students were in the classroom at the time. The rest were occupied cleaning outside the classroom.  
传统上，每个班级都会负责打扫学校的一部分。主要是他们的教室，但也包括公共区域，2-A 班在这方面也不例外。当时教室里不到三分之一的学生。其余的人都在教室外忙于打扫。

Shinji looked over at Rei, who was kneeling down rinsing a floor cloth. There was something familiar about the view, something warm. He didn't know what it was.  
碇真嗣看向绫波丽，她正跪在地上清洗抹布。这个场景有种熟悉感，有种温暖。他不知道那是什么。

Shinji's look did not escape the attention of his classmate, Toji. With a quick motion, Toji hit his friend with a broom.  
真嗣的眼神并没有逃过同学东治的注意。东治迅速地用扫帚敲了敲他的朋友。

"What's up, staring at Rei, are we?"  
怎么了，盯着零看，是吧？

"I wasn't staring, I just-"  
我没有盯着看，我只是……

Shinji didn't have time to finish his sentence before he was interrupted by the class representative. Hikari, of course, helped with the cleanup, but she additionally made sure that others helped as well.  
真嗣还没来得及说完话，就被班长打断了。当然，光帮忙清理了，她还确保其他人也一起帮忙。

"You two! Stop fooling around and get back to cleaning!"  
你们两个！别闹了，快回来打扫！

"Yes!" Without objection, they went back to cleaning.  
好的！他们没有异议，立刻回去继续打扫。

She looked up with satisfaction as they went back to cleaning up. Shinji was diligent, but Toji needed to be watched.  
她满意地抬头看着他们回去继续打扫。真嗣很勤快，但东治需要人盯着。

Meanwhile, Asuka entered the classroom, holding her phone in her hand. She looked disappointed.  
与此同时，明日香拿着手机走进教室，看起来有些失望。

"Is something wrong?" Hikari moved closer to her friend.  
“怎么了？”光靠近了她的朋友。

"Ugh, Kaji won't take calls from me. I haven't seen him in a while, and now Misato called and said they were going to some wedding, so we have the day off now."  
"哎呀，加持不接我的电话。我已经有一段时间没见到他了，现在美里打电话来说他们要去参加一个婚礼，所以我们今天放假了。"

Asuka didn't bother to hide her displeasure. She had wanted to see Kaji again for some time now. She had even called him recently, pretending to be assaulted by a pervert. To no avail, he hadn't called her back.  
明日香毫不掩饰她的不悦。她早就想再见加持一面了。她甚至最近还给他打过电话，假装被一个变态骚扰。但无济于事，他并没有回电。

"Both you and Shinji?" There was interest in Hikari's eyes.  
"你和真嗣都去吗？" 光的眼神中透露出兴趣。

"Yeah. What's it to you?"  
"嗯，关你什么事？"

"My sister asks me to set Shinji up with her friend. Are you okay with that?"  
"我妹妹让我帮真嗣介绍她的朋友。你介意吗？"

At this question, Asuka became flustered. Is Hikari suggesting something?  
听到这个问题，明日香有些慌张。绫波是在暗示什么吗？"

"Do I look like his mother? What do I care about this idiot?" Outraged, Asuka turned away. "Hey idiot!"  
"我看起来像他妈吗？我管这个白痴干嘛？" 愤怒的明日香转过身去。"喂，白痴！"

Shinji immediately looked towards Asuka. If anyone was in the habit of using the word idiot, it was Asuka, and it was almost always towards him. He made a questioning face towards the girl.  
真嗣立刻看向明日香。如果有人习惯用'白痴'这个词，那一定是明日香，而且几乎总是针对他。他向女孩投去询问的表情。

"Hikari wants to ask you out."  
"綾波想约你出去。"

"Don't say it like that, people will think something!" To Hikari's displeasure, people present in the classroom were already commenting on what they heard. Hearing the giggles and comments against her, she blushed.  
"别说得那么暧昧，别人会误会的！" 令光感到不悦的是，教室里在场的人已经开始对听到的内容议论纷纷。听到周围的窃笑和议论，她脸红了。

"Oh stop it! I'm not going to ask him out, I mean, I'm-oh just shut up. It's not like that! I just want to have a word." Hikari tried to explain, but became perplexed.  
"哎呀，别闹了！我又不是要去向他表白，我的意思是，我——哎，算了，别说了。不是你们想的那样！我只是想和他说句话。" 光试图解释，却越发困惑。

Red, she walked over to the boy and, grabbing his hand, led him out of the classroom. The fact that she's now pulling the boy out of class didn't help at all. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see the strange smiles on the faces of her classmates. As they pulled away slightly, Hikari tried to calm down. Asuka has put her in quite a mess.  
满脸通红，她走向那个男孩，抓住他的手，将他带出了教室。她现在拉着男孩离开课堂的事实一点也没有帮助。她眼角的余光瞥见了同学们脸上奇怪的笑容。当他们稍微拉开距离时，光试图让自己平静下来。明日香真是给她惹了个大麻烦。

"Umm, I'm flattered, but I don't think I'm your type." Embarrassed, Shinji tried to react somehow to what had just happened.  
"嗯，我很荣幸，但我觉得我可能不是你喜欢的类型。" 尴尬的碇真嗣试图对刚刚发生的事情做出反应。

"Asuka said it in the wrong way. It's not about me. My older sister would like me to set you up with her classmate."  
"明日香说错了。不是关于我。我姐姐希望我能介绍她的同学给你认识。"

"But, why?" He didn't know why this unknown friend wanted to date him. Yes, several classmates had tried to ask him out, but only after they found out he was a pilot. Why would a girl from another school, who doesn't know him at all, ask _him_ out?  
"但是，为什么呢？" 他不明白这位素未谋面的朋友为何想和他约会。确实，有几个同学在得知他是驾驶员后曾试图约他出去，但为什么一个完全不了解他的外校女生会想和他约会呢？

"She was at our apartment and saw our class picture. She asked a little bit about people and that was it. She said you're cute and that she would like to meet you."  
"她在我们公寓看到了我们的班级照片。她稍微问了问大家的情况，就这样。她说你很可爱，想见见你。"

"I don't know, I never-" He didn't have a chance to finish his sentence.  
"我不知道，我从来没——" 他没来得及说完这句话。

"Please! My sister asks me every day."  
"求你了！我妹妹每天都问我。"

"I don't think that's a good idea."  
"我觉得这不是个好主意。"

"Just one date. If you don't like it, that's it."  
"就一次约会。如果你不喜欢，那就这样。"

As relentless as ever, one of the qualities that made her a good class representative. He didn't want to say yes, but how could he refuse her when she was begging him? He sighed, wondering if he was doing the right thing.  
一如既往地坚持，这是她成为优秀班代表的品质之一。他不想答应，但面对她的恳求，他怎能拒绝？他叹了口气，心中疑惑自己是否做出了正确的选择。

"All right, if you insist so much, set us up. I can't promise she'll like it."  
"好吧，既然你这么坚持，那就安排一下吧。我可不敢保证她会喜欢。"

"Thank you so much! I'm sure you'll have a great time."  
"非常感谢！我相信你们一定会玩得很开心的。"

Before Shinji returned to class, he wondered what he had just gotten himself into. He had never been on a date, and now he's about to go on one with someone he hasn't even seen.  
在真嗣回到教室之前，他不禁思索自己刚刚陷入了什么境地。他从未有过约会经历，而现在他即将与一个连面都没见过的人去约会。

**Next day, Misato's apartment  
次日，碇真嗣的公寓**

Pacing around the room, Misato prepared for the wedding to which she had been invited to. Another one of her work colleagues is getting married. Dressed in her newly purchased gown, she faced the mirror.  
在房间里来回踱步，美里为即将参加的婚礼做准备。她的另一位工作同事即将步入婚姻的殿堂。身着新购的礼服，她面对着镜子。

'_29'_ she sighed. '29 岁'，她叹了口气。

Quite recently, she had a conversation with her old friend Ritsuko about it. She pointed out that a lot of women want to get married before they hit 30. She didn't think much of it. That was the case until her former partner Kaji arrived in Tokyo, making things complicated. She broke up with him a long time ago, and had almost completely forgotten about him. However, seeing him at the base reminded her of the old days. Times she remembered with fondness, even though she would never admit it.  
就在最近，她和老朋友律子聊过这个话题。律子指出，很多女性希望在三十岁之前结婚。她对此并不以为意。直到她的前伴侣加持来到东京，事情变得复杂起来。她和加持早已分手，几乎已经完全忘记了他的存在。然而，在基地见到他，让她想起了往昔的时光。那些她心存怀念的日子，尽管她永远不会承认。

The door to her room was pulled open. It was just her and Asuka in the apartment. PenPen, her adopted pet, was also in the apartment. He was resting in his specially prepared refrigerator.  
她房间的门被拉开了。公寓里只有她和明日香两人。她收养的宠物企鹅 PenPen 也在公寓里，正躺在它特制的冰箱里休息。

"I'm guessing you won't be back until morning?" Asuka's voice came from the living room.  
“我猜你得天亮才回来吧？”明日香的声音从客厅传来。

"I don't know yet, but more than likely I won't. Shinji said he'll do dinner when he gets back, so don't bother ordering out." Misato put on her earrings, and looked at her reflection in the mirror with a smile. "It's a bit of a shame that you're left alone today, isn't it?"  
"我还不太确定，但很可能不会。真嗣说他回来后会做晚饭，所以不用麻烦叫外卖了。" 美里戴上耳环，对着镜子中的自己微笑。"今天你一个人留在这里，有点可惜呢，不是吗？"

"At least I get a break from you guys."  
"至少我可以从你们这帮人中解脱一下。"

After leaving the room, Misato stopped for a moment to think if she had forgotten anything. When she was sure everything was okay, she walked past Asuka towards the exit.  
离开房间后，美里停下脚步，思考是否遗忘了什么。确认一切无误后，她从明日香身边走过，向出口走去。

As Misato walked by, Asuka smelled a familiar scent, a scent she liked.  
当葛城美里走过时，明日香闻到了一股熟悉的香味，那是她喜欢的味道。

"Is that lavender?" “是薰衣草吗？”

"Yes, I like this perfume." Misato looked at her watch. Before she started getting ready, she ordered a cab for a specific time. "Nice of that friend of yours to set Shinji up on a date. I think this break from school and piloting will do him good."  
“是的，我喜欢这款香水。”美里看了看手表。在她开始准备之前，她预约了一辆出租车，定好了时间。“你那位朋友安排真嗣去约会真是太好了。我想这次从学校和驾驶中抽身出来对他有好处。”

At the thought of Shinji and his date, Asuka snickered.  
一想到真嗣和他的约会，明日香就窃笑起来。

"Pathetic. He went on a blind date. On top of that, look how early he left! What, is he going to wait for her for a few hours? That idiot."  
真可悲。他居然去相亲。不仅如此，看他走得那么早！怎么，他打算提前几个小时去等她吗？那个傻瓜。

"Is someone jealous?" Misato had a sly smile on her face and a mocking voice.  
"是不是有人吃醋了？" 美里脸上挂着狡黠的笑容，语气中带着嘲讽。

"Hmpf. As if I could be jealous of that stupid-"  
"哼。我怎么可能嫉妒那个笨——"

"-little boy. I know Asuka, I know." It wasn't Asuka but Misato who finished her sentence, which was met with a sinister look from the girl. "You'll never find a boyfriend with that attitude, you know?" The older woman sighed, running a hand through her hair. "Shinji didn't leave early for the girl, he left early because today's the anniversary of his mothers death. He's likely already at the cemetery by now." Misato sighed, before straightening herself up.  
"——小男孩。我了解明日香，我了解。" 接话的不是明日香，而是美里，这换来了女孩一个阴沉的眼神。"你这种态度，永远别想找到男朋友，知道吗？" 年长的女人叹了口气，用手捋了捋头发。"真嗣不是因为那女孩才早走的，他早走是因为今天是她母亲去世的纪念日。他现在可能已经在墓地了。" 美里叹了口气，然后挺直了身子。

"I don't know why I'm telling you this, I know you don't care."  
"我不知道为什么要告诉你这些，我知道你不在乎。"

"I didn't know." Asuka had to fight a blush of embarrassment from rising up. How could she have overlooked that? She knew that just like her, Shinji had also lost his mother.  
"我不清楚。" 明日香努力抑制住因尴尬而泛起的红晕。她怎么会忽略了这一点？她知道，就像她一样，真嗣也失去了母亲。

"Okay, my cab should be waiting. Can you handle yourself?"  
"好的，我的出租车应该在等了。你自己能行吗？"

"Yeah, yeah, go right ahead."  
"行了，行了，你快去吧。"

"You can always have a chat with PenPen when he gets up."  
"等企鹅起床了，你可以随时和它聊聊天。"

"Talking to a bird, are you nuts?"  
"跟一只鸟说话，你疯了吗？"

Receiving no response before Misato left, Asuka turned her gaze towards the refrigerator where PenPen was sleeping. She wondered what Misato was referring to. Was it some kind of joke that she didn't understand?  
见真嗣没有回应，美里离开后，明日香将目光转向了冰箱，那里是企鹅睡觉的地方。她纳闷美里指的是什么，难道是什么她没听懂的笑话吗？

---

Lying in front of the TV, Asuka reached her hand into a bag of chips. A few small movements of her hand and a sigh. The bag was empty, and she was bored. To pass the time, she started to watch some drama on TV, but it was also mind numbingly boring. She got up, taking the empty bag to the trash before checking if there were any snacks left.  
躺在电视机前，明日香伸手进一袋薯片里。手在袋中动了几次，伴随着一声叹息。袋子空了，她感到无聊。为了打发时间，她开始看电视剧，但同样无聊得让人头脑发麻。她起身，将空袋子扔进垃圾桶，然后检查是否还有剩余的零食。

'_Should have bought more._'  
“早知道就多买点了。”

As she returned to her seat, she heard the door open. It was PenPen coming out of his refrigerator. Penguin came near Asuka and looked at her.  
当她回到座位时，听到门开了。是企鹅彭彭从冰箱里出来了。彭彭走近明日香，看着她。

"Oh, what a wonderful day. Alone in the apartment with a stupid bird. Seems like boredom is gonna kill me before the angels do."  
"哦，多美妙的一天。独自在公寓里，陪伴我的只有一只笨鸟。看来无聊会比天使们更早夺走我的生命。"

Calling PenPen stupid obviously didn't sit well with him, the bird flapping his wings angrily at the statement.  
显然，称 PenPen 为笨蛋让他很不高兴，这只鸟愤怒地拍打着翅膀以示抗议。

"What, am I wrong?" "怎么，我说错了吗？"

Penguin walked over to her and stood right in front of her.  
企鹅走过来，站在她面前。

_Wark!_

Surprised by his behavior, she didn't know if he felt offended or what. He was, after all, an ordinary animal. Suddenly, he did something she had not expected. He struck her on the shoulder with his beak, enough to elicit a small cry of pain from the girl.  
对他的行为感到惊讶，她不知道他是否感到被冒犯了，或者是什么。毕竟，他只是一只普通的动物。突然，他做了一件她没预料到的事。他用喙击打了她的肩膀，足以让女孩发出一声小小的痛呼。

"Ow! What the Hell was that for! You stupid bird!"  
“哎哟！你这蠢鸟，这是干嘛！”

Hastily getting to her feet to chase the offender, she looked to see that he was already halfway across the room. Noticing the girls enraged expression, PenPen began to run away, and Asuka gave chase. She didn't think that the bird could be so fast and agile. She chased him all over the living room, finally managing to chase the penguin to the corridor leading to the entrance of the apartment.  
急忙起身追赶肇事者，她看到他已经跑到房间的另一头。注意到女孩愤怒的表情，PenPen 开始逃跑，而明日香紧追不舍。她没想到这只鸟能如此迅速敏捷。她在客厅里四处追逐，最终将企鹅赶到了通往公寓入口的走廊。

"Now I have you, you have nowhere to run!"  
现在我逮到你了，你无处可逃了！

She stood facing him, waiting. She was prepared to catch him as soon as he tried to run past her. PenPen did something she hadn't expected. In a swift motion, he jumped between her legs and slipped on his stomach, sliding underneath her. While trying to grab him, she lost her balance and fell to the floor.  
她站在他对面，等待着。她准备在他试图从她身边跑过时抓住他。PenPen 做出了她未曾预料的动作。他迅速一跃，从她腿间穿过，腹部贴地滑行，从她身下滑过。在她试图抓住他时，她失去了平衡，摔倒在地。

"I won't let you get away with this!"  
"我绝不会让你就这样逃脱的！"

She got up and continued to chase after him. She chased him all over the apartment, beginning to wonder how much endurance the bird had, considering she was already starting to run out of breath. She paused for a moment to catch her breath.  
她站起身来，继续追赶他。她追着他跑遍了整个公寓，开始好奇这只鸟到底有多少耐力，因为她自己已经开始喘不过气来了。她停顿了一会儿，以便喘口气。

"How much longer can you run?" Gasping, she barely spoke the words. Taking a moment to catch her breath, she paused, looking back up at the bird quietly watching her.  
"你还能跑多久？" 她喘着粗气，几乎说不出话来。趁机喘口气，她停下脚步，抬头望向那只静静观察她的鸟。

"I'm still gonna kill you." After a few seconds, she continued her chase.  
"我还是会杀了你。" 几秒钟后，她继续追赶。

PenPen cleverly avoided being caught. He was able to jump away rather quickly the moment Asuka tried to grab him. She figured she had to find a way to confuse him somehow, and the kitchen furniture seemed like a good obstacle. At the table, she could try to confuse him as to which way she would run. As she ran into the kitchen, she thought she was going to catch him this time. Instead, she hit the leg of a chair with her toe.  
PenPen 巧妙地避开了被抓。当明日香试图抓住他时，他能够迅速跳开。她意识到必须想办法迷惑他，而厨房的家具似乎是个不错的障碍。在桌边，她可以试图让他猜不透她会往哪个方向跑。当她跑进厨房时，她以为这次能抓住他了。结果，她的脚趾撞到了椅子腿。

"Ouch!" "哎哟！"

She grabbed her foot and sat down on the floor. Massaging her sore foot, she watched as PenPen looked at her. She felt like hurting him, but Misato wouldn't allow it. Besides, she would have to catch him first, and this one is extremely resourceful.  
她抓住脚踝，坐在地板上。一边按摩着酸痛的脚，一边看着 PenPen 向她投来目光。她真想教训他一顿，但美里不会允许的。况且，她还得先抓住他才行，这家伙可是相当机灵。

"Okay, come back. I'm not gonna hurt you."  
“好了，回来吧。我不会伤害你的。”

But PenPen didn't approach the girl, just made another sound.  
但 PenPen 并没有靠近女孩，只是又发出了一声鸣叫。

_Wark!_

"What is it this time? I promise I won't do anything to you."  
"这次又怎么了？我保证不会对你怎么样。"

This time, Penguin fluttered his wings and stomped his feet. At this sight, Asuka didn't know what to say. Why was he reacting like this? Did this bird really understand what she was saying? Well, it was worth a shot.  
这次，企鹅扇动着翅膀，跺着脚。看到这一幕，飞鸟不知该说什么好。他为何如此反应？这只鸟真的明白她在说什么吗？嗯，值得一试。

"Ugh, fine. I'm sorry for calling you stupid."  
"唉，好吧。我为说你笨道歉。"

It worked, PenPen calmed down and approached her, albeit slowly, as if he was foreboding that she might want to trick him.  
成功了，PenPen 平静下来，虽然缓慢但确实地靠近了她，仿佛预感到她可能想要捉弄他。

"I really won't do anything to you."  
我真的不会对你做什么。

He sat down near her and watched her curiously.  
他在她附近坐下，好奇地观察着她。

"We're alone tonight. At least chasing you wasn't boring, although it was a little painful at the end."  
"我们今晚是独处的。至少追你并不无聊，尽管最后有点痛苦。"

There was silence in the room. PenPen continued to do nothing but stare, while Asuka massaged her foot. The pain was mostly gone by now.  
房间里一片寂静。PenPen 继续无所事事地盯着，而明日香则按摩着她的脚。现在疼痛已经基本消失了。

'_Misato probably figured that I would be bored, and that's why she talked about chatting with the penguin.'_  
'大概是美里觉得我会无聊，所以她才提到和企鹅聊天的。'

With not much to do, she figured she would complain for the sake of killing time.  
闲来无事，她想着抱怨几句，权当消磨时间。

"Misato is probably having fun at the wedding and Kaji must have joined her." She sighed. "He won't even take calls from me. Even when I'm pretending to be assaulted by a pervert!"  
美里肯定在婚礼上玩得开心，加持肯定也跟她一起去了。" 她叹了口气，"他连我的电话都不接。哪怕我假装被变态骚扰了！

PenPen made no sound, tilting his head slightly to the side. It gave the impression that he understood what Asuka was saying to him. Misato once mentioned that she rescued him from the lab. Maybe they did something to him that made him smarter than the other penguins?  
企鹅 PenPen 没有出声，只是微微侧了侧头。这模样让人觉得它似乎听懂了明日香对它说的话。美里曾提过，她是从实验室救出 PenPen 的。或许实验室对它做了什么，让它比其他企鹅更聪明？

"Even stupid Shinji did something. He saved my life in the volcano. But Kaji completely ignores me."  
"就连笨蛋真嗣也做了点事。他在火山里救了我的命。但加持完全无视我。"

The PenPen fluttered its wings again and approached her. At the gesture, Asuka was slightly startled.  
企鹅再次拍动翅膀，向她靠近。这个动作让明日香微微一惊。

"What is it this time? Keep your beak away from me!"  
"这次又是什么？离我远点！"

_Wark!_

What could he be referring to? After all, she didn't call him stupid just Shinji. Is he defending Shinji? She followed that lead.  
他指的是什么呢？毕竟，她并没有只说真嗣愚蠢。他是在为真嗣辩护吗？她顺着这个思路想下去。

"Okay, Shinji isn't stupid either."  
“好吧，真嗣也不笨。”

It worked, the penguin calmed down and returned to his seat.  
这招奏效了，企鹅平静下来，回到了自己的座位上。

"You're probably defending him because he gives you much better food than Misato." She snarled. "His cooking is boring, he just keeps repeating the few dishes he knows how to do." She paused for a moment, thinking about the food Shinji was preparing. "Well, they're not so bad overall, but he could add some variety sometimes."  
"你大概是因为他给你提供的食物比美里好得多才替他辩护的。" 她咆哮道，"他的烹饪很乏味，只是不断重复他知道的那几道菜。" 她停顿了一下，思考着真嗣正在准备的食物。"嗯，总的来说还不错，但他有时可以加点花样。"

The memory of Shinji's cooking was quite pleasant. He may not have been a virtuoso chef and prepared only a limited set of dishes, yet she liked them. Admittedly, she didn't always show it.  
真嗣的烹饪记忆相当愉快。他或许不是一位技艺高超的厨师，只会准备有限的几道菜，但她喜欢它们。诚然，她并不总是表现出来。

Meanwhile, PenPen walked over to the empty can and began tapping it with his beak. That got the girl's attention.  
与此同时，企鹅潘潘走到空罐子旁，开始用喙敲打它。这引起了女孩的注意。

"Collect your own trash."  
"自己收拾垃圾。"

He put his beak in the can as if he wanted to drink from it. Asuka realized he wanted her to give him a full one. When she came to live with Misato, she wondered how Misato could teach a penguin to drink beer. She walked over to the refrigerator and, after taking out a beer, put it on the floor. She watched in amazement as the penguin opened the beer by itself with its beak.  
他把嘴伸进罐子里，好像想从里面喝东西。明日香意识到他是想要一个满的。当她搬来和美里一起住时，她很好奇美里是怎么教会一只企鹅喝啤酒的。她走到冰箱前，拿出一罐啤酒放在地上。她惊讶地看着企鹅用自己的嘴打开了啤酒。

The penguin fluttered its wings, but differently than before. Asuka took it as a thank you. As she watched PenPen take his first sips of beer, she decided that, since no one was home, she might give it a try. She took a can out of the fridge for herself and sat down in the living room. As soon as the sound of the can being opened rang through the room, PenPen squirmed, flapping his free wing in a gesture of displeasure.  
企鹅扇动着翅膀，但和之前不同。明日香认为这是在表示感谢。当她看着 PenPen 第一次啜饮啤酒时，她决定，既然家里没人，她也可以尝试一下。她从冰箱里拿出一罐啤酒，坐在客厅里。罐子一打开的声音在房间里响起，PenPen 就扭动着身体，用自由的翅膀拍打，表达出不悦。

"One beer won't hurt me. Misato has so many that she won't even notice."  
"就喝一罐啤酒而已，不会有什么事的。美里那么多啤酒，少一罐她肯定察觉不到。"

She hadn't tried beer before, so she didn't know what to expect. After her first sip, she put the can down. The bitter taste and strange smell did not appeal to her.  
她以前从没喝过啤酒，所以不知道会是什么味道。第一口下肚后，她便放下了易拉罐。那苦涩的味道和奇怪的气味并不讨她喜欢。

"Gross, how can you drink that?"  
"好难喝，你们怎么喝得下去？"

Unmoved, PenPen calmly continued to drink his beer. Asuka tasted it again. The second sip was already less bitter, but she still didn't quite like it. Nevertheless, she decided that she would drink the beer. A moment passed and a thought came to her.  
纹丝不动的 PenPen 继续淡定地喝着啤酒。明日香又尝了一口。第二口已经不那么苦了，但她还是不太喜欢。尽管如此，她决定要喝完这瓶啤酒。过了一会儿，一个念头闪过她的脑海。

'_Pathetic, I'm here alone with a penguin and drinking beer. Even that stupid Shinji went on a date.'_ She mused, tapping her fingertips against the can.  
‘真可悲，我居然和一个企鹅单独在这里喝啤酒。连那个笨蛋真嗣都去约会了。’她暗自思忖，用手指轻轻敲打着易拉罐。

She raised her head, noticing that PenPen was looking at her. Did he want something from her? He looked at her as if questioningly.  
她抬起头，注意到 PenPen 正看着她。他是不是想要什么？他看着她，仿佛在询问着什么。

"What? I'm just thinking to myself how I'm the only one who hasn't gone anywhere today." When the penguin bowed his head again, she continued her lament. "Even stu-Shinji went on a date, but of course he didn't ask the girl out himself, just went on a blind date. He would never ask a girl because he's so, so... eh, it makes no sense. Why am I even talking to you?"  
"什么？我只是在想，今天只有我一个人哪儿也没去。" 当企鹅再次低下头时，她继续抱怨道，"就连书呆子——真嗣都去约会了，当然，他并没有主动约那个女孩，只是去相亲。他绝不会主动约女孩，因为他太，太……哎，真是莫名其妙。我干嘛跟你说这些？"

PenPen tapped his now empty can. The girl checked how much beer she had left in the can. Not much, maybe for a few sips. She felt warm on her face and wondered if it was from the beer. She got up and headed for the kitchen to grab two more beers from the fridge. A moment later she was back.  
企鹅拍了拍已经空了的罐头。女孩检查了一下自己罐中剩余的啤酒，不多了，可能只够喝几口。她感到脸颊发热，不知道是不是因为啤酒。她站起身，走向厨房，从冰箱里又拿了两罐啤酒。不一会儿，她就回来了。

"Look, I'm teasing him and he's not responding. I walk around the house in a loose shirt, tight shorts, sometimes I lean over to see his stu-his face when he gets nervous, but he just turns away. Is something wrong with me?"  
"看，我逗他，他都不回应。我在家里穿着宽松的衬衫，紧身短裤走来走去，有时候我故意俯身看他紧张的样子，但他只是转过身去。我有什么问题吗？"

PenPen at this point stood up and began hopping from foot to foot. For Asuka, he seemed to be dancing.  
此时，PenPen 站起来开始双脚交替跳跃。对明日香来说，他似乎在跳舞。

"Are you referring to our training?"  
你是在说我们的训练吗？

Instead of a reaction from the penguin, she saw him running to the bathroom. He most likely needed to use the restroom. Not caring, she took another sip of beer and waited for PenPen to return. When he returned, she continued her monologue.  
没有得到企鹅的回应，她看到他跑向浴室。他很可能需要上厕所。她不在意，又喝了一口啤酒，等待 PenPen 回来。他回来后，她继续自言自语。

"Back to our training. I wanted to see how he would react. I lay down next to him at night and what he does? Nothing! He does n-" She stopped when she remembered exactly what had happened. The memory brought a slight blush to her face.  
"回到我们的训练。我想看看他会有什么反应。晚上我躺在他旁边，他做了什么？什么也没做！他没——" 她停了下来，因为突然记起了确切发生了什么。那段记忆让她脸上泛起了一丝红晕。

_Wark?! 嘎？！_

PenPen's voice snapped her out of her reverie. Looking at him, she tried to explain herself. The situation she remembered made her uneasy.  
"企鹅 PenPen 的叫声把她从沉思中惊醒。看着它，她试图解释自己的行为。回忆起的情况让她感到不安。

"All right, all right! I panicked! Happy? I wanted to see what he would do. I didn't expect him to try to kiss me. I... Why did you remind me of that?"  
"好吧，好吧！我慌了！满意了吗？我只是想看看他会怎么做。没想到他居然想吻我。我...你为什么非要提醒我那件事？"

She did not get an answer to her question, PenPen did not pay any attention to her and continued drinking his beer. More minutes passed. Asuka's can was almost empty, but the girl didn't want to take another beer. She slammed her palm on the floor which drew PenPen's attention.  
她的问题没有得到回答，PenPen 对她视而不见，继续喝着啤酒。又过了几分钟。明日香的罐头几乎空了，但女孩并不想再拿一罐啤酒。她猛地拍了一下地板，引起了 PenPen 的注意。

"Can he only act when he thinks the girl is unconscious?" She caught another silent, questioning glance from the animal. "Why did he agree to this blind date anyway? He should have gone out with someone he knows, maybe someone from class or- Why did Hikari do it? If he hadn't gone out, he would have stayed here. Here, with m-"  
"难道他只有在认为女孩失去意识时才敢行动吗？"她又捕捉到了动物那无声的、询问的眼神。"他为什么要同意这次相亲呢？他应该和认识的人出去，也许是班上的某个人，或者——为什么是 Hikari 安排的？如果他没有出去，他就会留在这里。在这里，和我——"

Helpless, she lay with her back on the floor. She stared at the white ceiling like that for a moment, thinking of nothing. The room became so quiet that she could hear the hands of the clock moving. She turned her head and looked at the clock.  
无助地，她背靠地板躺着。她那样凝视着白色的天花板，一时间什么也没想。房间变得如此安静，以至于她能听到钟表指针的移动声。她转过头，看向那个钟。

"It's getting late, and he's not back yet. He's probably enjoying the date. I wonder who Hikari set him up with."  
天色渐晚，他还没回来。他大概正享受着约会吧。不知道光给他安排了谁。

She got up and took the cans except for the one PenPen was still drinking. She took them to the kitchen and prepared the trash for disposal. She preferred that Misato not accidentally notice the cans.  
她起身，除了 PenPen 还在喝的那罐，把其余的罐头都拿走了。她把它们带到厨房，准备处理垃圾。她更希望美里不会无意中注意到这些罐头。

"I'm going to take out the trash."  
"我要去倒垃圾。"

Getting no response, she left the apartment and headed for the dumpsters. These were located outside the building so she had to take the elevator down and walk a bit.  
没有得到回应，她离开了公寓，朝垃圾箱走去。这些垃圾箱位于大楼外，因此她不得不乘电梯下楼，再走一段路。

Once she had dumped the trash and was about to return, she spotted a black unmarked car. It looked like a car used by NERV. Her suspicions were confirmed when the car door opened and she saw Shinji getting out of the car. She was surprised to see that NERV agents had given him a ride home. He exchanged a few words with the agent, but she was too far away to hear what they were talking about.  
倒完垃圾正准备返回时，她注意到一辆黑色无标记的车。这看起来像是 NERV 使用的车辆。当车门打开，她看到真嗣从车里出来时，她的怀疑得到了证实。她惊讶地发现 NERV 的特工竟然送他回家。他和特工交换了几句话，但她离得太远，听不清他们在说什么。

As the car drove away, she called out to Shinji. He looked at her and waited outside the entrance. As she approached, she could see that he had something on his right hand. It looked like his hand was wrapped in something.  
随着车子驶离，她向真嗣喊了一声。他望向她，站在入口处等待。当她走近时，她注意到他的右手似乎被什么东西包裹着。

"Hey, you've been away for a while. The date must have gone we-what happened to you?" The girl was surprised by what she saw. When she was close enough, the sight of the injured boy was revealed to her eyes. His face had one or two bruises and minor cut. The pink shirt he often wore outside of school was torn at the neck, plus it was missing some of its buttons. On the shirt itself, she noticed small traces of dried blood. He held some sort of plastic bag on his right hand, she wasn't sure what for.  
“嘿，你离开了一会儿。约会肯定很顺利——你怎么了？”女孩被眼前的景象惊到了。当她走近时，受伤男孩的样子映入她的眼帘。他的脸上有几处瘀伤和轻微的划痕。他常在校外穿的粉色衬衫领口撕裂了，还掉了几颗扣子。衬衫上，她注意到有干涸血迹的痕迹。他右手拿着一个塑料袋，她不清楚是做什么用的。

"Let's go inside and I'll tell you." She nodded and they headed for the apartment.  
“我们进去吧，我会告诉你的。”她点了点头，两人一起走向公寓。

Once they were in place, Shinji grabbed a cold drink from the fridge and sat down at the kitchen table. Asuka could now look at him in better light. She took a paper towel, some water and disinfectant to wash the traces of dry blood from the boy's face.  
待一切就绪后，真嗣从冰箱里拿了一瓶冷饮，坐在餐桌旁。此时的明日香能更清楚地观察他。她取了纸巾、水和消毒剂，开始清洗男孩脸上的干涸血迹。

"Thank you. You don't have to disinfect, they've already done it."  
“谢谢你。其实不用消毒了，他们已经处理过了。”

"Tell me what happened." She began to gently clean Shinji's face.  
“告诉我发生了什么。”她开始轻柔地为真嗣擦拭脸庞。

"I was attacked by Akane's ex-boyfriend." Seeing the questioning face, he immediately explained. "Akane is the girl Hikari set me up with."  
"我被茜的前男友袭击了。" 看到对方疑惑的表情，他立刻解释道，"茜是光给我介绍的那个女孩。"

"You've been gone a long time. Did you run into her ex-boyfriend by chance?"  
"你去了好久。难道是碰巧遇到了她的前男友？"

"No, he attacked me at the very beginning of the date. It's been maybe half an hour. I didn't do anything." He squirmed slightly as she cleaned his face. "He hit me first. I gave it back, but I think I hurt myself more than I hurt him."  
"不，他是在约会一开始就袭击了我。大概也就半个小时。我什么都没做。" 她给他清理脸时，他微微扭动了一下。"他先动手的。我还手了，但我觉得我伤自己比伤他多。"

"You hit him?" She didn't expect that Shinji could hit someone.  
"你打了他？" 她没想到真嗣会打人。

"They said it's not broken." He removed the plastic bag from his hand. It was a cooling bandage. When he showed Asuka his hand, you could see that it was slightly red and had scratched skin, nothing serious. He clenched his fist several times. His hand didn't hurt.  
"他们说没骨折。" 他把手上的塑料袋取下，里面是冷却绷带。当他向明日香展示手时，可以看到手略微发红，有些擦伤，并不严重。他握拳几次，手并不疼。

"What happened next?" "后来怎么样了？"

"Security arrived. They separated us and wanted to call the police. When they found out I was a pilot, they called NERV. I was gone for so long because they were helping me and questioning me."  
"安保人员到了。他们把我们分开，并打算报警。当他们得知我是飞行员后，就联系了 NERV。我离开这么久是因为他们在帮助我并进行询问。"

When she finished washing her face, she looked at his face. Before the wash it looked more serious. A minor bruise and a scratch, it would disappear in a few days.  
她洗完脸后，看着他的脸。洗脸前看起来更严肃些。一点小淤青和划痕，过几天就会消失。

"Did they say what it was about?"  
"他们有说是什么事吗？"

His face became sombre, it was obvious that he was not happy with the situation. Before he gathered himself to speak, he sighed.  
他的脸色变得阴沉，显然对这种情况感到不满。在他整理思绪准备开口之前，他叹了口气。

"Akane's boyfriend cheated on her with another girl and they broke up. The guy was pissed about it and she wanted him to feel jealous. When she learned from Hikari that I was a pilot, she insisted that she set us up. You know, to tell others that she was dating someone _famous_. When Hikari set us up, she spread the word to everyone that she was going to meet me in such a way that her boyfriend would hear it. And the rest, well, you probably guessed it."  
阿花（Akane）的男朋友背着她和另一个女孩出轨，两人因此分手。那男的对此很生气，而她则想让他感到嫉妒。当她从光（Hikari）那里得知我是飞行员后，她坚持要光撮合我们。你知道的，为了向别人炫耀她在和一个名人约会。光安排我们见面时，她故意放出风声，让她的前男友也能听到。至于后来的事，嗯，你大概也能猜到了。

'_So it wasn't about Shinji at all.'_ She leaned back in her chair and pondered. She didn't know if Shinji was happy he was going on a date. Even so, she felt a little sorry for the boy.  
'所以这根本不是关于真嗣（Shinji）的事。'她靠在椅背上沉思。她不知道真嗣是否因为即将去约会而感到高兴。尽管如此，她还是对这个男孩感到有些同情。

"Why did you agree to go on this date?"  
"为什么你同意来这次约会？"

"Hikari insisted." He lowered his head, trying to avoid Asuka's gaze.  
"是光坚持的。" 他低下头，试图避开明日香的目光。

She slapped her forehead. This boy was impossible sometimes. Zero assertiveness, solely wanting to be nice to others.  
她拍了拍自己的额头。这个男孩有时候真是让人无语。一点主见都没有，只知道一味地对别人好。

"I'll have to talk to Hikari about this blind date idea. What was she thinking?"  
"我得跟光谈谈这个相亲的想法。她到底是怎么想的？"

"Please don't. How could she know?"  
"请别这样。她怎么会知道呢？"

She stood up and gathered the things from the table with which she cleaned his face.  
她站起身，从桌上收集了用来给他擦脸的东西。

"Sometimes you're too nice to people, you know?"  
"有时候你对人太好了，知道吗？"

He didn't say anything, just rested his head against his palm. Asuka returned to the table and they sat like that for a while in silence. The silence was broken by Asuka with a question that surprised Shinji.  
他没有说话，只是将头靠在手掌上。明日香回到桌边，两人就这样静静地坐着。沉默被明日香打破，她提出了一个让真嗣感到意外的问题。

"Have you ever kissed?" "你接过吻吗？"

"No. Why the question?" "不，为什么这么问？"

At this point she was sitting sideways to him and looking ahead. Without looking at him she asked another question.  
此时她正侧身坐着，目光直视前方。她没有看他，又提出了一个问题。

"Do you want to try it?"  
"你想试试吗？"

"You want to kiss? Why?"  
"你想接吻吗？为什么？"

This time she turned to him and looked at him. He had a questioning look on his face, even a little funny.  
这次她转向他，注视着他。他脸上带着疑问的表情，甚至有点滑稽。

"Out of boredom." "因为无聊。"

"What a strange reason, to kiss out of boredom."  
"多么奇怪的理由，因为无聊而接吻。"

"Aww, afraid of a little kiss?  
"哎呀，害怕一个小小的吻吗？"

She leaned toward him. "Are you?"  
她向他倾身。 "你呢？"

Her voice seemed provocative. He didn't know if it was some kind of trick or maybe a stupid joke. Knowing Asuka, it probably was, and she would eventually end up making fun of him later.  
她的声音似乎带有挑逗意味。他不知道这是某种伎俩还是愚蠢的玩笑。了解明日香的话，很可能是后者，她最终会在事后取笑他。

His inaction annoyed her. Unable to get an answer, she stood up. Just as she was about to leave the table, Shinji's voice stopped her.  
他的无动于衷让她恼火。得不到回应，她站起身来。正当她准备离开桌子时，真嗣的声音阻止了她。

"I'm not afraid, it's just a kiss."  
“我不害怕，只是一个吻而已。”

"Well, let's do it." "嗯，那就开始吧。"

He nodded and stood up. As she began to bring her face closer to his, he closed his eyes. After a moment, he felt the touch of her lips. When he opened his mouth slightly, he felt the touch of her tongue. It was a strange sensation accompanied by a slightly bitter taste. He recognized a familiar smell in the air, the smell of beer. Why did she smell like beer?  
他点了点头，站起身来。当她开始将脸靠近他的时，他闭上了眼睛。过了一会儿，他感觉到她的唇触碰到了自己。当他微微张开嘴时，他感觉到她的舌尖。这是一种奇怪的感觉，伴随着一丝苦涩的味道。他闻到了空气中熟悉的气味，那是啤酒的味道。为什么她身上会有啤酒的味道呢？

Shinji did not stand still as she had assumed, but engaged in a kiss. Not only did he work his mouth, but he also put his hand on her shoulder. Asuka felt a shiver. A shiver and a strange feeling. She was unable to associate the feeling. She didn't know how long they kissed, but it seemed like an eternity. It scared her a little and she broke the kiss.  
正如她所预料的那样，真嗣并没有静止不动，而是回应了她的吻。他不仅动用了嘴巴，还将手放在了她的肩膀上。明日香感到一阵颤栗。一阵颤栗和一种奇异的感觉。她无法将这种感觉归类。她不知道他们吻了多久，但似乎有一个世纪那么长。这让她有点害怕，于是她结束了这个吻。

"Kissing out of boredom is not the best idea." She said without thinking and turned around. She wanted to go to her room as soon as possible. Her heart was pounding and she was shaking imperceptibly.  
"因无聊而接吻可不是个好主意。" 她不假思索地说着，转身欲走。她想尽快回到自己的房间。她的心跳加速，身体微微颤抖。

She hadn't even taken a step when Shinji grabbed her arm. When she looked at him he seemed concerned.  
她还没来得及迈出一步，真嗣就抓住了她的手臂。当她看向他时，他显得很关切。

"Why do you smell like beer?"  
"你怎么闻起来有啤酒味？"

"PenPen spilled beer on me!" She said quickly, panicked. The reaction to her words was swift. PenPen began flapping his wings in displeasure. "Okay, I had one beer." The fluttering of the wings was joined by sounds. "All right, all right. I had two beers. Traitor!" She sighed. "Don't tell Misato."  
"PenPen 把啤酒洒我身上了！" 她急忙说道，显得很慌张。她的话立刻引起了反应。PenPen 开始不悦地拍打翅膀。"好吧，我喝了一杯啤酒。" 翅膀的拍打声中夹杂着其他声音。"好了好了，我喝了两杯。叛徒！" 她叹了口气。"别告诉 Misato。"

Shinji laughed, which was an unusual sight for Asuka. She had only ever seen him smile once, never laughing. It was when he ran after her during their training to comfort her. She smiled at the sight.  
真嗣笑了，这对明日香来说是个罕见的景象。她只见过他微笑一次，从未见过他笑。那是在他们训练时，他追着她跑去安慰她的时候。看到这一幕，她微笑了。

"I won't tell, promise." He nervously scratched the back of his head. "Thanks. For, um, clearing my face and f-for making this nasty day not so bad."  
"我不会说的，我保证。" 他紧张地挠了挠后脑勺。"谢谢。为了，嗯，帮我擦脸，还有让这个糟糕的一天不那么糟。"

'_Not so bad huh?'_ An idea popped into Asuka's head. She didn't know why she wanted to do it, but she wanted to try.  
'也没那么糟吧？'一个念头突然闪现在明日香的脑海中。她不知道自己为何想这么做，但就是想尝试一下。

"Next time, instead of going on a blind date, ask someone out yourself. Ask someone you know at least a little bit."  
下次，别去相亲了，自己主动约人吧。至少约一个你稍微有点了解的人。

"I don't know, I've never asked a girl out. I don't think I could." Slightly embarrassed, the boy rubbed the back of his head with his hand.  
"我不太清楚，我从没约过女生。我觉得我做不到。" 男孩略显尴尬地用手挠了挠后脑勺。

"Why? It's not hard. Try asking me out."  
"为什么？这不难。试着约我出去。"

"You?" "你？"

"Yes, me. I'm not going to laugh."  
"对，我。我不会笑你的。"

When he didn't answer, she rolled her eyes and walked towards her room. She was halfway there when Shinji caught up to her and spoke.  
见他没有回答，她翻了个白眼，朝自己的房间走去。走到一半时，真嗣追了上来，开口说道。

"I-Asuka-I mean. I." His nervousness made it difficult for him to speak. "Would you l-like to go out with m-me sometime?" He was relieved to find it wasn't particularly difficult. Just like she had said, it wasn't that hard.  
"“我-明日香-我是说。我。”他的紧张让他难以开口。“你-你愿意和我-我出去吗？”他松了一口气，发现这并不特别困难。正如她所说，这并不难。”

"Lame, but it'll do." She clapped her hands. "Tomorrow. I'll think about it and choose where we go. Of course you pay."  
"“挺逊的，但还行。”她拍了拍手。“明天。我会考虑一下，决定我们去哪儿。当然是你付钱。”

"Are we going on a d-date tomorrow?" He murmured. He thought she just wanted him to practice, but she really wanted to go on a date with him?  
"我们明天是要去约会吗？" 他低声问道。他以为她只是想让他练习，但她真的想和他约会吗？

"Well, you invited me. Unless you want to back out?"  
"嗯，是你邀请我的。除非你想反悔？"

"No, there any ex-boyfriends I should worry about?"  
"不，没有什么前男友我需要担心的吧？"

She giggled as she heard this. Shinji looked genuinely concerned.  
她听到这话咯咯地笑了。真嗣看起来真的很担心。

"No, I never had a boyfriend." She saw him looking at her with a strange look on his face, but she didn't know why. "What?"  
“不，我从来没有交过男朋友。”她看到他用一种奇怪的眼神看着她，但她不明白为什么。“怎么了？”

"Was that your first kiss?"  
“那是你的初吻吗？”

"If I hear you brag about it, you'll regret it." She blushed slightly. "Yes, it was."  
"如果我听到你吹嘘这件事，你会后悔的。" 她脸颊微红，"是的，确实如此。"

He nodded, fully aware that he preferred not to check how serious she was.  
他点了点头，心里清楚自己宁愿不去探究她到底有多认真。

_Wark!_

PenPen stood beside them, staring. When they saw him, they became tense and moved away from each other.  
企鹅 PenPen 站在他们旁边，目不转睛地盯着。当他们注意到它时，立刻紧张起来，彼此间拉开了距离。

"Call me when you make dinner." Asuka headed toward her room.  
"做饭时叫我。" 明日香朝她的房间走去。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Yes?" She asked, without turning around.  
"什么事？" 她问道，没有回头。

"I'm bored." "我无聊了。"

"Don't push your luck." A smile appeared on her face that the boy could not see. '_He is a quick learner.'_ Standing in front of the door, she turned her head to Shinji. "Try to make my date enjoyable and maybe I'll let you walk me home."  
"别得寸进尺。" 她脸上浮现出男孩看不见的微笑。'他学得挺快。' 站在门前，她转头对真嗣说："试着让我的约会愉快些，或许我会让你送我回家。"

"But we live together." He didn't understand what she meant. Why shouldn't they get back together if they live together? Is this some kind of another ploy on her part?  
"但我们住在一起啊。" 他不明白她的意思。既然住在一起，为什么不能复合呢？这又是她耍的什么花招？

"I told you he was stupid." This time she spoke to the penguin. She went into her room and closed the door.  
"我早说过他很蠢。" 这次她是对着企鹅说的。她走进自己的房间，关上了门。

Shinji looked at PenPen and crouched down.  
真嗣看着企鹅便蹲了下来。

"What else did she say about me?"  
她还说了我什么？

_Wark!_
