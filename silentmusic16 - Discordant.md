**I cannot begin to stress what a difficult desert of a lack of creativity I endured in the past 9 months. After graduating college (finally!) in May, I spent the next ~9 months writing about 50,000 words in various fics and started what felt like a million different things I could not find it in me to finish. I worked a ton, I went on job searches, I dealt with life with all of its highs and lows.  
我无法开始强调过去 9 个月里我所经历的创意匮乏的荒漠。去年五月大学毕业后，接下来的大约 9 个月里，我在各种同人作品中写了约 5 万字，开始了许多感觉像是无数个我无法完成的不同项目。我工作很忙，四处求职，经历了生活中的高低起伏。**

**So it's unbelievable to finally finish something! I really hope that my creative struggle worked out with this. And, more than anything, I hope I can return to writing and publishing more consistently. In any case -  
终于完成某件事真是难以置信！我真心希望我的创作挣扎能在这件事上得到回报。而且，最重要的是，我希望我能重新开始持续地写作和发表。无论如何——**

**Enjoy~ 尽情享受吧~**

**Part 1 第 1 部分**

The line Asuka stands on is longer than she expected it to be, regardless of the prestigious academy shining there at the end. Middle school students preparing to graduate, just as she is, wait for their opportunity to perform before a panel of judges and their chance to make it into the Tokyo-3 Music Conservatory High School. Most of them have their instruments clutched in their hands in hard clam-shell cases; even more of them are shaking, shivering, their feet tap tap tapping, the echoes of nervous laughter and chattering teeth bouncing off of the cold concrete in the early morning. Asuka stands firm, arms crossed over her chest with her violin case dangling off of her fingers. She's not like the rest of them. She's not fidgeting. She's not even nervous. Asuka is ready for this. All of the training, all of the time she took has brought her to here and now. She watches the flash of birds passing the curved glass windows, shadows against the light. The same flicker past her face, and then are gone an instant later.  
明日香所站的队伍比她预想的要长，尽管那所著名的学院就在尽头闪耀着。像她一样即将毕业的初中生们，都在等待着在评委面前表演的机会，以及进入东京-3 音乐学院高中的机会。他们中的大多数人都紧握着装在硬壳箱中的乐器；更多的人在颤抖，双脚轻轻敲击，紧张的笑声和打颤的牙齿声在清晨的冷混凝土上回响。明日香坚定地站着，双臂交叉在胸前，小提琴箱挂在手指上。她和他们不一样。她没有坐立不安。她甚至不紧张。明日香已经准备好了。所有的训练，所有她投入的时间都把她带到了这里，现在。她看着鸟儿掠过弧形玻璃窗的闪光，光影交错。同样的闪光掠过她的脸庞，然后瞬间消失。

The line inches forward and curves naturally around the pillars that rise and keep the concrete pass-way awning above their heads. A finger taps at her shoulder and she waits a beat before turning her head. Exhibiting power and control are important, even here, even now. This is the pre-interview - standing above the others, standing out among the masses. The girl who tapped her shoulder has a freckled face and smiles at her hesitantly, though the end result is practiced and bright.  
队伍缓缓前行，自然地绕过那些拔地而起的柱子，支撑着头顶的混凝土通道顶棚。有人轻拍她的肩膀，她停顿了一下才转过头。展现力量和控制很重要，即使在这里，即使现在。这是面试前的时刻——站在他人之上，在人群中脱颖而出。拍她肩膀的女孩脸上有雀斑，带着些许犹豫的微笑，尽管最终效果是经过练习的，显得明亮而自信。

"Hello!" the girl says, bending forward at the hip. There's a rectangular case gripped tightly in her hand, probably a flute or a clarinet. "I'm Horaki Hikari. You're here for the interview?"  
“你好！”女孩说着，身体微微前倾。她手里紧握着一个长方形盒子，可能是长笛或单簧管。“我是洞木光。你是来参加面试的吗？”

"Why else would I be here?" Asuka answers. She holds a hand at her hip, the picture of casual confidence. "I'm aiming for a spot in the string quartet. Actually," she corrects herself. "I'm here to get that spot in the string quartet."  
“不然我来这里干嘛？”明日香回答道，一手叉腰，尽显随意的自信。“我目标是弦乐四重奏的位置。实际上，”她纠正自己，“我是来拿下那个弦乐四重奏的位置的。”

"With that attitude, I'm glad I'm not competing against you." Hikari laughs lightly. Her shoulders shake, girlish and open. Asuka can't remember ever feeling that way. "I'm here for the wind ensemble myself."  
"就你这态度，我真庆幸不用跟你竞争。" 光轻声笑了起来，肩膀微微颤动，显得既少女又坦率。明日香记不得自己是否曾有过这样的感觉。"我本人是来参加管乐团的。"

Asuka considers this. Then, she holds out a hand. "Asuka Langley Soryu. I'm the best violinist in this line."  
明日香思索片刻，然后伸出手来。"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，这条队伍里最出色的提琴手。"

As the line moves forward they chat. Asuka tells Hikari only what she wants the girl to know, but her voice is loud because she wants the whole line to know, too: tales of her accomplishments, her awards, her participation not only in Japanese concerts, but in an expo in Germany. She paints, in bold words and a fiery tone, a picture of her life that seems to reflect the bright sun outside in its whites and reds, her victories decisive and rewarded. If her interested nodding says anything, Hikari isn't turned off by the bragging. Asuka thinks that she looks genuinely impressed. She's done her job, then, and so she turns the conversation around.  
"随着队伍向前移动，她们开始交谈。明日香只告诉光她想让对方知道的事情，但她的声音很大，因为她希望整条队伍的人都能听见：她的成就、奖项，以及不仅在日本，还在德国的一次博览会上参与演出的事迹。她用大胆的言辞和激昂的语调，描绘出一幅似乎与外面明媚阳光下的白与红相映成趣的生活画卷，她的胜利果断而荣耀。如果光那频频点头的样子能说明什么，那么她并没有被明日香的炫耀所反感。明日香觉得她看起来真的很佩服。那么，她的任务完成了，于是她转而引导话题。

"And you?" she asks, "Have you done any tours or anything?"  
"那你呢？"她问道，"你有没有参加过什么巡演或者类似的活动？"

Hikari shakes her head. "No, no - I have a lot of responsibilities at home with my sisters. My mother...she passed, so I kind of run the house."  
光摇了摇头。"没有，没有——我在家里有很多责任要照顾我的姐妹们。我母亲...她去世了，所以我算是家里管事的。"

There's a flush of pain that rides up Asuka's core, lapping at the walls of her throat. She forces it down. Her mother is dead too, and in a moment of weakness she wants to say something to the girl. Some congratulations for even being there. For not breaking down. They both understand a specific pain that neither would wish upon anyone else; at least in this, they're sisters-in-arms. But she doesn't. Different units or not, she and Hikari are still rivals. And, as the hot bravado rushes through the grooves in which her chilly pain had already run, Asuka realizes too that she has still gone further than this Hikari girl. That whatever words of encouragement or praise she could utter would be better focused at herself, certainly.  
一股痛苦涌上明日香的心头，舔舐着她喉咙的壁垒。她强压下去。她的母亲也去世了，在一瞬间的脆弱中，她想要对这个女孩说些什么。为了她能在这里，没有崩溃，而表示祝贺。她们都理解一种特定的痛苦，这是她们不愿施加于任何人的；至少在这点上，她们是并肩作战的姐妹。但她没有说出口。不论是否属于不同的单位，她和光仍然是对手。而且，随着那股炽热的勇气涌过她冰冷痛苦已经流过的沟壑，明日香意识到自己仍然比这个叫光的女孩走得更远。无论她能说出什么鼓励或赞美的话，都更应该聚焦于自己，这是肯定的。

"Well, I suppose I can't blame you for not having the time. Touring doesn't give you the chance to do anything else, really." Asuka shrugs. She remembers the tight time tables she dealt with in Germany around all of those perfunctory people - not that she had any trouble keeping up. But all of the events had been in strict order, one after another, with little room for her to appreciate the time until afterwards. At least after the long beginning and the depressingly long end.  
"嗯，我想我不能怪你没时间。巡演确实让你没有机会做其他事情，真的。" 明日香耸了耸肩。她回忆起在德国时那些紧张的时间表，周围都是些例行公事的人——不过她倒是没有跟上任何麻烦。但所有的活动都是严格按顺序进行的，一个接一个，几乎没有给她留下欣赏时间的机会，直到事后。至少在漫长的开始和令人沮丧的结束之后。

During the conversation their part of the line has all but reached the doors. Asuka moves forward on auto-pilot matching her steps to everyone else's, until the girl in front of her stops short. She bangs into the body standing there and grips the violin case protectively as she teeters, until Hikari, gripping at the corner of her dress, pulls her back. The girl she bumped into picks herself off of the floor and resumes staring out at nothing, out into the crowded early morning streets full of faceless people and vehicles whose windows glare harshly, obscuring the passengers within.  
在谈话中，他们这一队人几乎已经到了门口。明日香下意识地跟着大家一起向前走，直到前面的女孩突然停下。她撞上了站在那里的人，紧紧抓住小提琴盒以防摔倒，直到光抓住她裙角的一角把她拉回来。被她撞到的女孩从地上爬起来，继续呆呆地望着外面，望着那条挤满了面无表情的人和车辆的繁忙清晨街道，车窗的反光刺眼地遮挡了乘客的面容。

"What was that about?" Asuka yells. She pushes the girl's shoulder, watches her stumble a bit as her body turns. "Why don't you pay attention to where you're going?!"  
"那是什么意思？" 明日香大声质问。她推了推女孩的肩膀，看着她踉跄转身。"你走路不看路吗？！"

It takes a second for the girl to fully turn around, and Asuka feels her anger double in that time. "Hey!" she yells again. "Are you just going to stand there? Answer me!"  
女孩完全转过身来需要一秒钟，而在这段时间里，明日香的怒气翻倍。"喂！"她再次喊道，"你就打算站在那儿吗？回答我！"

When the girl finally looks up at her, Asuka finds herself at a loss for words. They are taken from her in anger and in exasperation. The girl is shorter than her by a head, and sickly pale. She looks at Asuka with a blank stare in the most literal way, as if her red eyes breed a silence between them that matches what seems to be the thoughtlessness in her head. Her blue hair is wispy and light, and falls in messy bangs across her forehead. She doesn't say anything; her mouth is shut, sealed like a tomb, and as stony as one too, without an expression. There's something about the way the light settles on her, touches her soft skin and powder-blue hair that blurs the girl at the edges. As if she herself is as light as her hair, as immaterial, and with a simple gust of wind or sharper glare of the sun she might flutter or flicker or fade out of view.  
当女孩终于抬头看向她时，明日香发现自己无言以对。愤怒和无奈让她语塞。女孩比她矮一个头，面色苍白得病态。她用最字面的空白眼神看着明日香，仿佛她那双红眼睛在两人之间孕育出一种沉默，与她脑海中似乎的空洞相匹配。她的蓝发轻柔而稀疏，凌乱的刘海横在额前。她一言不发；嘴巴紧闭，像坟墓一样封存，表情同样坚硬。光线落在她身上，触碰她柔软的皮肤和粉蓝色头发，使女孩的轮廓变得模糊。仿佛她本身就像她的头发一样轻盈，虚无缥缈，只需一阵风或阳光的强烈一瞥，她可能就会飘动、闪烁或消失不见。

"My apologies." the girl says, and the breeze seems to whisk away her words, or the life in them, before they cross the small distance to Asuka with all the weight of cicada husks. Then she's quiet again. Her face would be a perfect mask - porcelain and paint, alabaster and ink - were it not for the slightest tremble in her wide ruby eyes giving something, something unknowable, away.  
"对不起。"女孩说道，微风似乎卷走了她的话语，或是其中的生命力，在跨越与明日香之间那微小距离时，它们轻如蝉蜕。随后，她再次陷入沉默。若非她那双宽大的红宝石般眼睛微微颤抖，泄露了某种难以捉摸的东西，她的面容本可完美如瓷面与彩绘，象牙白与墨迹。

The shuffle of feet breaks the silent spell, and the girl moves with the crowd again.  
脚步的沙沙声打破了静默的魔咒，女孩随着人群再次移动起来。

"Whatever. People like you don't deserve to be on this line." Asuka throws out. She can't continue with these distractions. Not with the girl in front of her, and not with Hikari behind her. Instead, she goes over the piece she'll play in her head again. The bars and measures are lined up like soldiers and she hums along in review. Hikari has fallen silent. They're close to the entrance now. One person goes in at a time and leaves before the next is called in. The girl she bumped into enters before her, and in the minutes in between Asuka steels her nerves. She finds that single-minded focus she has always worked with and smooths down the churning in her gut, the fluttering in her chest that would give away her nervousness, could anyone hear it. The blue haired girl walks out of the room as quietly as she enters. She doesn't look at Asuka as she leaves, only clutches the hard-case in her hands tensely.  
“随便吧。像你这样的人不配站在这条线上。”明日香脱口而出。她无法忍受这些干扰，无论是面前的女孩，还是身后的光。于是，她再次在脑海中回顾即将演奏的曲子，音符和节拍排列得像士兵一样整齐，她轻声哼唱着进行复习。光也沉默了。她们离入口越来越近，一次只允许一人进入，前一个人离开后，下一个人才能被叫进去。那个与她相撞的女孩先进去了，在等待的几分钟里，明日香坚定了心神。她找回了那份一贯的专注，平息了胃中的翻涌和胸口的悸动，那些会泄露她紧张情绪的细微反应，如果有人能听见的话。蓝发女孩悄无声息地走出房间，离开时并未看向明日香，只是紧紧抓着手中硬壳琴盒。

It's Asuka's turn after that and she marches straight ahead, head held high, ignoring the call of "good luck" that Hikari passes her way. She doesn't need luck. Her trust in her body - the muscles she's formed, the reflexes she's honed - there is no luck needed within absolute personal confidence. She doesn't need luck when she could wear her awards like a general does his medals, pinned to her chest as a testament to her work and sign to anyone who might challenge her authority among all of these other school children. She needs a unanimous decision from the three judges she'll be playing in front of in order to get into the school, but she's not worried even the slightest bit.  
接下来轮到明日香，她昂首阔步直向前行，对光传来的“加油”声置若罔闻。她无需运气。她对身体的信任——锻炼出的肌肉，磨练出的反应——在绝对的自信中，运气毫无必要。她无需运气，当她能像将军佩戴勋章一样，将荣誉别在胸前，作为她努力成果的证明，也是对任何可能挑战她在这群学童中权威的人的警示。她需要三位评委的一致决定才能进入这所学校，但她丝毫不感到担忧。

The room she enters is cold in temperature and tone, an arctic tundra and white enough to match that image. There's a simple platform to stand on, unadorned except for the black music stand that sticks out like a bug on a tv screen at night. She places her sheet music there. Not that she needs it. The piece is memorized, the notes all but calling to her - pre-loaded into her fingers like she's a music-playing automaton. The three judges at the table in front of the stage gaze up with wildly different views. In the center is an older man whose glasses obscure his eyes, and whose patient frown offers no mercy. To the right, a blonde woman looks on with her pen already hovering over a clip board; her gaze is cutting and critical, as if she's unraveling Asuka right there and then. The third woman has a youthful air, and she gives a small, friendly wave as Asuka pulls the violin from the case, runs the amber-colored rosin against the horse-hair bow, and then gives a few test runs against the strings. They sing like a voice, sharp and resonant, and cut into the empty tundra air of the room.  
她踏入的房间温度与色调皆冷，宛如北极苔原，一片洁白。中央设有一简朴平台，除却那突兀如夜屏上飞虫的黑漆乐谱架外，别无装饰。她将乐谱置于其上，尽管无需此举——曲目早已烂熟于心，音符仿佛呼之欲出，指尖似预载了演奏程序的机械。舞台前桌后的三位评委，目光迥异。居中者为老者，眼镜遮目，耐心的皱眉不露慈悲；右侧金发女士，笔尖已悬于记分板，眼神犀利批判，仿佛当场剖析着她。第三位女士则显年轻，友善地轻挥手，当她从盒中取出小提琴，用琥珀色松香摩擦马尾弓毛，随即在弦上试奏几音。琴声如人声般尖锐而共鸣，划破了房间内空寂的苔原气息。

Asuka levels a fiery glare at all three judges at once. Were she to trade out her white dress for a rockstar get up, she might have an image to sell.  
明日香同时向三位评委投去炽热的目光。如果她把身上的白色连衣裙换成摇滚明星的装扮，或许就能塑造出一个形象来。

"I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. You might as well sign me up now," she smirks confidently, "You won't hear a better musician today."  
我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。你们不妨现在就签下我，"她自信地笑着说，"今天你们再也听不到比这更好的音乐家了。

**Part 2 第二部分**

Asuka is filled with a rancid disgust as takes in her new school. It's a bubbling thing this revulsion, battery acid and boiling flesh that weighs her stomach down into her knees. Students filter into the school beyond the wrought iron gate, where the black paint flicks away to reveal the rust underneath - to show its weakness to the Sun. Above the gate is a sign reading _Hakone School of the Arts_, and just the shape of those _kanji_ ignites the roiling brew in Asuka until she is physically sick. This is a scandal. An outrage. An embarrassment. A shame. She isn't where she's supposed to be. The morning sun beats down on her back, mercilessly pushing her forward. The concrete beneath her grips at her feet to keep her in place.  
明日香满怀恶臭的厌恶感审视着新学校。这种反感如沸腾的液体，混合着电池酸液与滚烫的肉体，沉重地压迫着她的胃，直抵膝盖。学生们穿过锻铁大门鱼贯而入，那漆黑的表面剥落，露出底下的锈迹，向阳光暴露其脆弱。校门上方悬挂着“箱根艺术学校”的招牌，仅是这几个汉字的形状就点燃了明日香内心翻滚的厌恶，直至她感到身体上的不适。这是一桩丑闻，一场公愤，一次耻辱，一种羞愧。她并未身处应许之地。晨光无情地照耀在她背上，推着她前行。脚下的混凝土仿佛紧抓着她的双脚，试图将她固定在原地。

Still, she holds her head up high and takes her place among the crowd. She knew she was the best in that line two months before, but now, as she surveys the mish-mashed dregs that file into the school with peasant smiles and glassy eyes, she's assured in that statement. She is absolutely the best player at this school. Her shine and spark, like so many stars, will standout evermore against the backdrop of black-sky peerlessness here. The Tokyo-3 Music Conservatory will regret ever turning her down.  
尽管如此，她依然昂首挺胸，在人群中占据一席之地。两个月前，她就知道自己是那批人中的佼佼者，而现在，当她审视着那些带着农民般的微笑和空洞眼神的乌合之众鱼贯进入学校时，她更加确信这一点。她绝对是这所学校里最出色的演奏者。她的光芒与活力，如同繁星一般，将在这片无垠的黑暗天空中永远闪耀。东京第三音乐学院终将后悔拒绝了她。

_**"Overly emotional. Aggressive play overwhelms the music. Arrogance belies weaknesses. Uncontrolled and uncontrollable. A total lost cause"**_ The rejection letter said. She'd burned it after reading it twice. Those idiots - didn't they know that her confidence was her strength? That her emotion and aggression were better than the lifeless rote-playing of every one of those children who lined up with her? She knew a few of the people who had been accepted to Tokyo-3 from competitions and exhibitions, and she knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that none of them - none of them - played with the kind of life and blood that she did.  
‘过于情绪化。激进的演奏掩盖了音乐本身。傲慢背后隐藏着弱点。无法控制且难以驾驭。彻底的失败者。’这就是拒绝信上的内容。她读了两遍后便将其焚毁。那些蠢货——难道他们不明白，她的自信正是她的力量所在吗？她的情感和激进难道不比那些与她并肩排队、只会机械演奏的孩子们强吗？她从比赛和展览中认识了一些被东京第三音乐学院录取的人，她毫不怀疑，他们中没有任何一个人——没有任何一个人——能像她那样，演奏出充满生命力和热血的音乐。

Asuka takes in the school while she makes her way to the music wing. As if the school's spiritual degradation changes it physically, she notices just how run down the place is. The washed out gray-yellow of the walls, the scuffed floors, whose lack of a shine is only more pronounced in the conspicuous absence of wide windows and natural lighting, the ancient hinges on doors that squeak whenever they open to let people in and out - there's even a smell about the place, something between dust and musk and glue that has, in only a few minutes, already seeped into Asuka's clothing. Hakone School of the Arts ought to be destroyed, she thinks, smashed - crushed - battered - but the visual image is barely a comfort. She's here now. The shining glass and steel modern art of the Tokyo-3 Conservatory are as far away as anything, as that time she toured in Germany, which, though only a few years before, seems all but a dream now.  
明日香在前往音乐翼楼的途中，审视着这所学校。仿佛学校的灵性堕落改变了它的物理形态，她注意到这个地方是多么破败。褪色的灰黄色墙壁，磨损的地板，由于宽大的窗户和自然光线的明显缺失，地板的光泽更加黯淡；古老的门铰链在每次开关时都会发出吱吱声，让人进出；甚至还有一种气味，介于尘埃、麝香和胶水之间，仅几分钟便已渗透进明日香的衣服。箱根艺术学校应该被摧毁，她想，粉碎——碾压——击打——但这种视觉想象几乎无法带来安慰。她现在就在这里。东京-3 音乐学院那闪亮的玻璃和钢铁现代艺术，以及她曾在德国巡演的时光，虽然只是几年前的事，现在却如同遥不可及的梦境。

The music wing contains only one major classroom; smaller group and individual rooms line the rest of the wing like flute tone holes. She flicks her long red hair as she enters and, just as she desired, draws the eye of nearly everyone in the room. They learn from her stride that she's serious; see in her eyes and the set of her jaw her distaste; glean from her clenched fist the hunger gnawing at her for escape. Her budding body carries with it a sense of what she herself would call adulthood, right or wrong. The boys, in mere seconds, want her - though she wants nothing to do with them. The girls stew in that shaded valley between jealousy and desire. Only one pair of eyes hasn't looked her way, and instead gazes out of the window and into the blank-blue of the day. Asuka recognizes her, though it takes a moment. Realization singes her with anger and shame all at once. It's the girl she bumped into in line, the one with blue hair and lifeless eyes. There's an open seat at the front of the room and Asuka takes it. Anything for an advantage, anything to show her teachers and conductors that she is serious. Anything - anything not to have to see that girl she'd looked down on, who, like a scrape or a scar, is a testament to a mistake Asuka made.  
音乐翼楼仅有一间主教室，其余部分则排列着小型团体和个人练习室，宛如长笛音孔。她步入时轻甩一头火红长发，如愿以偿地吸引了室内几乎所有人的目光。从她的步伐中，人们读出她的认真；从她的眼神和紧抿的嘴角，看出她的厌恶；从她紧握的拳头，窥见她渴望逃离的饥渴。她初绽的身躯携带着一种她自认为的成熟感，无论对错。男孩们瞬间便对她心生向往，尽管她对他们毫无兴趣。女孩们则在嫉妒与渴望的幽谷间徘徊。唯有一双眼睛未曾向她投来目光，而是凝视窗外苍白的天空。明日香认出了她，尽管稍有迟疑。这一认知同时点燃了她的愤怒与羞愧。那是她在排队时撞见的女孩，蓝发无神眼眸的那位。教室前方有个空位，明日香毫不犹豫地坐下。任何优势都不放过，只为向老师和指挥们展示她的认真态度。 任何事——只要不用再见到那个她曾轻视的女孩，那个如同擦伤或疤痕一样，见证了明日香所犯错误的女孩。

Handsomely disheveled, a young male teacher comes in and quiets the students. He's tall and slouches with his hands in his pockets, the image of relaxed confidence. Asuka hates him immediately. Music is supposed to be taken seriously, but the vibe the man gives out is entirely the opposite. Still, she has to latch onto him. She has to use whatever means she can to get up and get out of this school with glowing recommendations.  
一位英俊而略显凌乱的年轻男教师走了进来，让学生们安静下来。他高大而驼背，双手插兜，一副轻松自信的样子。明日香立刻对他产生了反感。音乐本应被严肃对待，但这位男士散发出的氛围却完全相反。尽管如此，她必须依附于他。她必须利用一切手段，以优异的推荐信从这个学校脱颖而出。

"Class," he says. Even his voice sounds like the shrugging of shoulders. "I'm Ryoji Kaji. Welcome to your new school. Whether your time here is great or not is up to you, as I'm sure you'll all learn. I'll be heading the chamber music groups, which you will all be broken up into today." he smiles lazily at the classroom, and Asuka folds her hands together more tightly to stop herself from calling him out on his apathy. "After that, you guys will have some time to get to know your classmates."  
他开口道：“同学们，”连他的声音都像是耸肩一般随意。“我是加持良治。欢迎来到你们的新学校。你们在这里的时光是否美好，取决于你们自己，我相信你们都会明白这一点。我将负责室内乐团，今天你们将被分组。”他懒洋洋地对着教室微笑，而明日香则更加紧握双手，以免自己当场指责他的冷漠。“之后，你们将有时间去了解你们的同学。”

---

He knows how to conduct at least, Asuka thinks, while Kaji moves his hands around in the air miming a baton. Students are placed into chamber music groups - string quartets and quintets, smaller wind ensembles, and finally, as his imaginary baton flicks at Asuka, piano quartets. She follows his hand movements and, chagrined, walks between the bunched up tables to the back of the room. She feels the glances of other students on her back, but doesn't lower herself to look at them. They don't even deserve her derision, let alone her attention.  
他至少懂得如何指挥，明日香心想，此时薰正挥舞双手在空中模仿着指挥棒的动作。学生们被分入室内乐小组——弦乐四重奏和五重奏，小型管乐合奏，最终，随着他虚构的指挥棒轻点向明日香，钢琴四重奏。她跟随他的手势，带着几分懊恼，穿过拥挤的桌子走向教室后方。她能感觉到其他学生的目光落在自己背上，却傲然不屑一顾。他们甚至不配得到她的轻蔑，更遑论她的关注。

Her heart sinks when she finally takes in the wretches she'll be playing with. There's a young boy with sad eyes and a pathetic way of holding himself; a single earbud hangs out of his ear, as droopy as his expression. He keeps glancing at the boy beside him, who has lanky arms and is wearing what she can best describe as a grin of obscurity. It's the last person in the group that all but sets her off, however. That girl, the one from the line, sits with her head still turned outwards towards the window. She glanced over when Asuka walked up with another blank stare - it borders on more than just a lack of expression, and instead it's almost a non-expression, the purposeful negation of emotion rather than the lack of it - but she has turned back again and now Asuka can only see bits and pieces of her reflection floating against the clear glass of the window.  
当她终于看清即将与之共处的这群可怜人时，她的心沉了下去。有个眼神忧郁的男孩，姿态卑微，一只耳机松垮地挂在耳边，神情同样萎靡。他不时偷瞄身旁的另一个男孩，那人手臂细长，脸上挂着她所能形容的最模糊的笑容。然而，真正让她几乎崩溃的是最后那个人。就是排队时的那个女孩，她坐着，头依然转向窗外。当明日香走近时，她瞥了一眼，又是一个空洞的眼神——这不仅仅是缺乏表情，更像是刻意否定了情感，而非简单的缺失——随后她又转了回去，现在明日香只能透过窗户的透明玻璃，看到她零星的倒影。

"Pleasure to meet you," the taller boy greets, holding out a hand after running it through his cloud-gray hair. There's a strange glint to his eyes - he looks like he knows more than he lets on, or like he has removed himself in some way from the reality around him. An angel looking down from above, waiting to carry out some higher judgment. Asuka doesn't take his hand, which casually drops onto the shoulder of the boy beside him, and instead sits cross-armed in a chair around the four person group. "I'm Kaworu Nagisa." the boy continues, ignorant of the burning blush n the other boy's face.  
"很高兴见到你，"高个子男孩问候道，他用手梳理了一下自己云灰色的头发后伸出手来。他的眼神中闪烁着一种奇异的光芒——看起来他知道的事情比他透露的要多，或者他以某种方式将自己与周围的现实隔离开来。就像一个从高处俯视的天使，等待着执行某种更高的裁决。明日香没有握他的手，那只手随意地搭在了旁边男孩的肩上，而她自己则双臂交叉坐在四人小组的椅子上。"我是渚薰。"男孩继续说道，没有注意到另一个男孩脸上燃烧的红晕。

"Shinji Ikari. I hope we get along." the other boy offers with a small smile.  
"我是碇真嗣。希望我们能相处愉快。"另一个男孩带着微笑说道。

Asuka doubts it very much. She ignores Shinji and glares at the back of the other girl's head. "And you?" she asks, her face scrunching up like speaking to the girl is lemon tart.  
明日香对此深表怀疑。她无视了真嗣，瞪着另一个女孩的后脑勺。"你呢？"她问道，脸上的表情像是跟那个女孩说话就像是在吃柠檬挞一样酸涩。

"I believe that that's - " Kaworu begins, trying to be the good hearted mediator; how honest he is in taking this role is confused by that ever-present near-smirk. Asuka finds the exuberant way he gestures with his hands as he speaks almost irritating enough to swat them out of the air.  
"我相信那是——"薰试图扮演和事佬的角色，他那始终带着一丝似笑非笑的表情让人难以判断他是否真心承担这个角色。明日香发现他边说边挥舞双手的夸张方式几乎让她烦到想把他的手从空中拍掉。

"I didn't ask you. Why can't she answer? You, hey - you spoke to me before. Your name, what is it?"  
"我没问你。她为什么不能回答？你，嘿——你之前跟我说话了。你叫什么名字？"

Once more a silent moment passes like a low cloud over the group, the shade mismatched to the splendor of the day outside and the chatty excitement throughout the classroom. Their table, their group, is already ostracized from the rest: in mood, in intensity, even physically, where they're placed in the back corner and all but obscured by the dusty sunlight covering them like a veil; every one of these is a mark, a welt against Asuka's needling itch for attention, for a hold on every eye in the room. It only enrages her more. She stands and slams her hand onto the girl's desk. When the girl flinches, when she draws in a quick cutting breath, Asuka smirks. She is glad to feel this kind of power. Glad to not only draw attention, but to get reactions. Glad to get her way.  
又一次，沉默如低云般笼罩着这个小团体，与外面灿烂的日光和教室里热闹的兴奋气氛格格不入。他们的桌子，他们的小团体，已经从其他人中孤立出来：无论是情绪、紧张程度，甚至物理位置上，他们被安置在教室后方的角落，几乎被尘封的阳光覆盖得如同面纱；这一切都是标记，是针对明日香渴望关注、渴望掌控房间里每一双眼睛的刺痛需求的烙印。这只会让她更加愤怒。她站起来，猛地拍在女孩的桌子上。当女孩畏缩，当她急促地吸了一口冷气时，明日香露出了得意的笑容。她很高兴能感受到这种力量。高兴不仅能吸引注意，还能引起反应。高兴能如愿以偿。

"Rei. Rei Ayanami." she finally answers. Asuka watches Rei's pale pink lips move in the reflection of the window and again her voice has come and gone like there's an electric switch controlling it - the sound coming into existence from nowhere and ending just the same. A voice as controlled as her face.  
"绫波。绫波丽。" 她终于回答道。明日香注视着绫波那淡粉色的嘴唇在窗户的倒影中移动，她的声音再次如同一道电闸控制着——声音不知从何而来，又同样突然消失。她的声音就像她的面容一样被严格控制着。

Satisfied, and yet, not, Asuka addresses the group. "Now I can't imagine that any of you have in interest in being the head here." Silence. Stares. Shinji's mouth opens like he wants to say something, but she goes ahead anyway. "That's what I thought. We're going to do things my way, then."  
满意，却又未尽，明日香向众人发话。"现在我想你们当中没人有兴趣当这里的头儿吧。" 沉默。凝视。真嗣的嘴张开似乎想说些什么，但她还是继续说道。"我就知道。那我们就按我的方式来。"

At the front of the classroom Kaji claps his hands twice and hushes the students. While he drones on about the expectations of the coming year and uses his fingers to list the classroom rules, Asuka finds that she can only give him a bit of her attention. Nervous energy sparks in her chest like embers from a fire. It crackles, her head turns to Kaworu, a hand lazily holding up his chin. As it sizzles she finds Shinji taking notes. But more than anything it snap, and it snaps to the other girl. Rei, beside her, hasn't moved her eyes from the scene outside the window and the courtyard down below. Only the way that her hands, once folded in her lap, now tap in silent thumps, can Asuka guess that Rei may be here, in the room, and not gone to some unknown place deep within her own mind.  
在教室前方，卡吉拍了两下手，让同学们安静下来。当他用手指列举着新学年的期望和课堂规则时，明日香发现自己只能分出一点注意力给他。紧张的能量在她胸中如火中余烬般闪烁。它噼啪作响，她的头转向薰，他正懒洋洋地用手托着下巴。随着这股能量的沸腾，她发现真嗣正在记笔记。但更多的是，她的注意力突然转向了另一个女孩。坐在她旁边的绫波，眼睛始终没有离开窗外和下面的庭院。只有她原本叠放在膝上的手现在无声地敲打着，明日香才能猜测绫波可能还在这个房间里，而不是沉浸在她自己深不可测的思绪中。

She hates that the girl isn't taking any of this seriously.  
她讨厌那个女孩对这一切都不认真的态度。

She hates herself for the hypocrisy of doing the same.  
她讨厌自己同样不认真的虚伪。

**Part 3 第三部分**

The end of the day comes far too slowly and without any of the relief she expects from it. She's tired, irritated, the dry September air and angle of the falling light adding to the painful buzzing in her head, in that spot behind the eyes that seems exclusively made for headaches. All she wants is the sanctuary of the dorm she's been given for her stay at this wreck of a school. Somewhere empty and quiet, where her thoughts, twisted shapes of disappointment and anger, could stretch and linger in the space around her instead of ricocheting inside of her skull. She hadn't been to the dorms yet - the students were ushered to their classes and promised that the goods they'd sent a week before the start of the semester made it safe and sound, and now this herd of young people crowd the walkway between the major school buildings and the prefab dorms lined up in planters' rows. They're squat buildings, the dorms. Little more than breezeblocks stacked on top of one another covered in gallons of plastishine paint and about as inviting to Asuka as the prisons they resemble.  
一天的结束来得异常缓慢，丝毫没有她期待中的解脱感。她感到疲惫不堪，心烦意乱，干燥的九月空气和落日的角度加剧了她头部的刺痛，那正是专为头痛而生的眼后位置。她只想回到分配给她的宿舍，在这所破败学校中的避风港。一个空旷而宁静的地方，让她的思绪——失望与愤怒交织的扭曲形态——得以伸展并停留在她周围的空间，而不是在她脑海中回荡。她还未曾踏足宿舍——学生们被引导至各自的教室，并被告知他们一周前寄出的物品已安全抵达，而现在这群年轻人挤满了连接主要校舍与预制宿舍的步道，这些宿舍排列得如同种植园里的行行作物。宿舍低矮，不过是几块空心砖叠在一起，涂上了几加仑的塑料光泽漆，对明日香来说，它们就像监狱一样毫无吸引力。

In the last girls-only building, past the oddly-cavernous lobby filled with empty plastic chairs like molded stalagmites, Asuka trudges her way to her own room in the very back. The door looks like all of the others; the scratchy, badly trodden rug leading to it is the same shade of dull gray, and the faded paint around the entrance has the same smudges and smears as the rest. She compares the room number on the crumbled paper in her hand to the plastic sign on the door and then crumples it some more, until the sharp corners of the misshapen ball poke her palm.  
在最后一栋女生专属的建筑里，穿过那奇特而空旷的大堂，里面摆满了如同塑形石笋般的空塑料椅，明日香拖着沉重的步伐走向自己位于最深处的房间。房门看起来和其他的并无二致；通往门口的粗糙地毯，被踩踏得破旧不堪，呈现出同样的暗灰色，而入口周围褪色的油漆上，也和其他地方一样布满了污迹和划痕。她将手中皱巴巴的纸上的房间号与门上的塑料标牌对比，然后又将其揉得更皱，直到那不成形的纸团尖锐的角刺痛了她的手掌。

The knob is cold as she turns it, the door stuck a bit on its hinges, and so she pushes too hard to open it. She stumbles in. And then, with the icy-hot combo of surprise and despair, Asuka sees what she wanted to see least. It's a shock of blue, a watercolor spill in the corner of the dusk-coated canvas of the room. Rei Ayanami is reading a book on one of the two beds with what may have been a smile, though it flees in time with the swinging door and the soundless fury of Asuka's clenched fist and tensed throat. Rei glances at her and then back at the book without saying a word.  
门把手冰冷，她转动时，门因铰链有些卡住，于是她用力推开，踉跄着走了进去。紧接着，明日香最不愿见到的一幕映入眼帘，她感到一阵冰火交加的惊愕与绝望。那是角落里一抹蓝色，如同黄昏笼罩的房间画布上泼洒的水彩。绫波丽正坐在其中一张床上读书，或许曾露出一丝微笑，但随着门的摆动和明日香紧握的拳头、紧绷的喉咙中无声的愤怒，那微笑转瞬即逝。绫波丽瞥了她一眼，然后又默默地低头继续看书。

"Why are you in my room?" Asuka asks, the rage in her voice poised on a pinhead.  
"你为什么在我的房间里？" 明日香问道，她的愤怒如同针尖上的平衡，一触即发。

"The dorms are shared rooms," Rei flips a page slowly with a finger tip. "We've been assigned as roommates." She's as listless as a tired child being dragged around on errands. There's a weight to her body that is also a weightlessness, just the suggestion of her displacement on the bed in this case; a presence made apparent by her lack of a presence overall. Asuka hates the way the girl lives this near-ethereal existence, as if she has no place in this world and exists only as the reflection of _something_ else _somewhere_ else. She hates looking at her in general, at the cloudy outline of the nothing girl. If her anger wasn't best directed through the narrowing of her eyes, Asuka likely would've closed them instead of looking at Rei any longer.  
"宿舍是合住的房间，" 绫波缓缓翻过一页，指尖轻触。"我们被分配成了室友。" 她像一个疲惫的孩子被拖着四处奔波，身体沉重却又仿佛轻飘飘的，只是在这张床上留下了她存在的暗示；她的存在感因整体上的缺乏而显得突出。明日香讨厌这个女孩近乎幽灵般的生活方式，仿佛她在这个世界上没有位置，只是某个地方其他事物的倒影。她讨厌看着她，看着那个模糊不清的虚无女孩。如果不是通过眯起眼睛来最好地表达她的愤怒，明日香可能早就闭上眼睛，不再看绫波了。

"Like hell we are!" The door slams behind Asuka, who has already made her way into the cramped space. Between the two beds, which are placed against opposite walls, are two night tables and a large double-doored boudoir. The room is painted an off-beige that looks to be too afraid to choose a definite hue. A bookshelf stands at the wall beside Rei's bed - and whether it was there, or whether she brought it with her isn't clear - as is the room's only window, a glowing stamp on the otherwise envelope-flat wall. Asuka's end has nothing but the box she shipped to the school weeks before, full of nothing important. The only important thing she owns, anyway, is her violin.  
"谁跟你一样！" 门在惣流身后砰地关上，她已经挤进了这个狭小的空间。两张床分别靠在相对的墙上，中间夹着两个床头柜和一个双开门的大衣柜。房间涂着一种怯懦的米白色，似乎不敢确定自己的色调。在绫波床边的墙上立着一个书架——不知是原本就在那儿，还是她带来的——房间唯一的窗户也在这面墙上，像是一枚发光的邮票贴在平坦的信封般的墙上。惣流这边除了几周前寄到学校的箱子外别无他物，里面装的全是不重要的东西。她唯一重要的东西，就是她的那把小提琴。

Still, she cannot accept the terms of this ridiculous rooming situation. Her short march sees her beside Rei's bed, standing over her much like she did earlier in the day in the classroom.  
尽管如此，她还是无法接受这个荒谬的住宿安排。她快步走到绫波的床边，就像白天在教室里那样居高临下地站在她面前。

"I want you out of here." Asuka says forcefully.  
"我要你搬出去。" 惣流强硬地说道。

"These are shared rooms," Rei repeats. "And we're roommates." There's little strength to her voice, however, and the look she gives Asuka is that same one she always wears - a statue's face, her mouth a perfectly straight line, like there's nothing behind those eyes but an infinite empty pit that the girl is falling through, ever further into the depths of an unknowing, unseeing mind. Like she's not even there, her body the last physical evidence of an existence long since vanished in spirit.  
"这是共用房间，"绫波重复道，"我们是室友。"然而，她的声音缺乏力量，她看向明日香的眼神依旧是那副模样——宛如雕像的面容，嘴角是一条笔直的线条，仿佛那双眼睛背后只有无尽的空洞，少女正不断坠入其中，愈发深入那无知无觉的心灵深处。仿佛她已不复存在，身体成了早已在精神上消逝的存在仅存的物质证明。

It's sickening, Asuka thinks, as that same vacuousness rips away the oxygen that had fueled the fire of her indignation. There's no use in arguing with Ayanami. Asuka's sure her voice is barely echoing off of the walls of whatever makes up Rei's mind. Or maybe it's that old image of a rock falling down an empty well - down, down, soundlessly, and Asuka's not sure if there's enough water at the bottom to make a splash. With a tut of her tongue she goes over to lay down on her own bed. There's nothing to replace the anger now that it's gone, only the hole in her chest that anger so often fills. The hole she works her hardest to hide. Asuka tries to count the dust motes floating in the shafts of sunset-sunlight that come in through the window beside Rei, but it's an impossible task, and anyway, the insignificance of the floating bits of not-much reminds her of her own place in this insignificant school - though, of course, she'd like to be seen as the sunlight itself illuminating that dust, the radiance brightening their impurity and uselessness.  
令人作呕，明日香心想，那种空洞感正夺走她愤怒之火所需的氧气。与绫波争论毫无意义，明日香确信自己的声音在绫波心灵的墙壁上几乎无法回响。或许就像一块石头坠入空井，无声地下沉，下沉，而明日香不确定井底是否有足够的水来激起涟漪。她咂舌一声，走向自己的床躺下。愤怒消散后，胸中的空洞无物填补，那是愤怒常驻之地，也是她竭力隐藏的空洞。明日香试图数清透过窗户洒在绫波身旁的夕阳光束中漂浮的尘埃，但这任务徒劳无功，况且，这些微不足道的漂浮物提醒着她在这所无足轻重的学校中的位置——当然，她更愿被视为照亮尘埃的阳光，以其光辉净化它们的杂质与无用。

Asuka tries this, but she can't sit still. Inactivity rings in her ears like the sounding of a timer, shrill and piercing and urging her into action. She stands then in the center of the room, hands on her hips, staring at Rei. The air is stale and somehow, though it's warm outside, brisk. It might just be the atmosphere, she thinks, or Rei, if the lifelessness in her body is cold where she - where living, breathing, feeling people are warm. She taps her foot impatiently. Her body is working faster than her mind now, pulling the exhausted thing along like a tired dog on a leash. Before the thought fully forms in her head Asuka rummages through her small box of goods. Moments later she finds the permanent marker she was looking for, and then, like a painter or a photographer, stands with her hands making a camera lens - her fingers a wide square, one eye squinted, measuring the length and width of the room. Rei is looking at her over the pages of her book and, perhaps for the first time, Asuka sees a flash of attention there. Maybe even annoyance. It spurns her on. At the center of the room, on the far wall, she draws a small black dot. Rei's eyes widen, though the rest of her expression is still stone.  
明日香尝试着静坐，却无法保持不动。静止在她耳边回响，如同计时器的鸣响，尖锐刺耳，催促她行动起来。她站起身，在房间中央，双手叉腰，凝视着绫波。空气沉闷，尽管外面温暖，室内却透着一股寒意。或许是氛围使然，她想，或是绫波，如果她体内那股死寂般的冷意，与活生生、呼吸着、感受着的人们的温暖相对立。她不耐烦地跺着脚。此刻，她的身体比思绪更为迅捷，拖着疲惫的意识前行，如同牵着一只疲惫的狗。念头尚未完全成形，明日香便翻找起她的小箱子。片刻后，她找到了那支永久性记号笔，随后，宛如画家或摄影师，她双手比划成镜头——手指构成一个宽阔的方形，单眼微眯，测量着房间的长宽。绫波透过书页望向她，或许这是第一次，明日香在那目光中捕捉到一丝关注，甚至可能是恼怒。这激励了她。在房间中央，远处的墙上，她画下了一个小小的黑点。 绫波的眼睛睁大了，尽管她其余的表情依旧如石雕般冷漠。

"See here, Ayanami - this dot I just drew? This separates our sides of the room. Don't cross it. No matter what. I sure as hell won't."  
听着，绫波——我刚画的这个点？它划分了我们房间的两边。别越过它。无论如何都不要。我绝对不会。

Asuka watches Rei look from the dot to the other side of the room, where the boudoir sits squarely center, and obviously there for both of them to use. "What about that?"  
明日香看着绫波从那个点望向房间的另一侧，那里正中央摆放着化妆台，显然是为她们俩准备的。“那这个怎么办？”

"We'll split it too. Right down the middle. Don't touch my clothes, don't cross this line, don't even look in my direction. You got that?" Now, with more control, her beloved sense of assuredness comes over her, as if she had gone out in the cold without a jacket and found one, warm and ready to be worn, forgotten on a bench.  
"我们也会平分的。正好对半分。别碰我的衣服，别越过这条线，甚至别朝我这边看。明白了吗？" 现在，随着更多的控制，她那令人喜爱的自信感又回来了，仿佛她出门时没穿外套，却在长凳上发现了一件，温暖而准备就绪，被遗忘在那里。

Rei takes a breath. When Asuka strains her ear, she can hear the little sigh that escapes the other girl's throat. It sounds, almost, as if she is going to speak. Complain, maybe. Offer some sort of truce. Yell or scream or cry, even. There's a part of Asuka that wants this more than anything; if there's blood in the other girl's veins then they can be friends, or enemies, rivals - whatever, anything that wouldn't make it so that Asuka has to live in this cold room and be reminded of her loneliness by checking it against the fact that there's actually another person with her. Not alone, but lonely. Not solitary, but feeling solitude.  
绫波深吸了一口气。当明日香竖起耳朵时，她能听到另一个女孩喉咙里逸出的小小叹息。听起来，几乎像是要说话。抱怨，也许是。提出某种休战。大喊大叫或哭泣，甚至。明日香内心有一部分比什么都渴望这样；如果另一个女孩的血管里有血液，那么她们就可以成为朋友，或敌人，竞争对手——什么都行，只要不是让明日香不得不住在这个冰冷的房间里，通过对比发现实际上还有另一个人与她同在，来提醒她的孤独。不是独自一人，却感到孤独。不是独处，却感受到孤寂。

But she says nothing. Rei looks once more over what has become no man's land and then returns to her book. The shuffling sound of the turning page makes up for the quietness of her sigh.  
但她什么也没说。绫波再次看了一眼已经变成无人地带的地方，然后回到她的书上。翻页的沙沙声弥补了她叹息的寂静。

Asuka sinks onto her bed as her spirit sinks with a disappointment it ought to have seen coming, a rainstorm on a cloudy day that still catches you by surprise.  
明日香颓然倒在床上，她的心情也随之沉入失望的深渊，就像阴天里突如其来的暴雨，明明早有预兆，却仍让人措手不及。

**I have to say, I think what I've found hardest about writing these characters is that NGE (and, to a lesser extent, Rebuild) develops the characters in such a way that it feels impossible to pull them from their original places, stories, and developmental tracks and still keep the characters intact, while allowing for new avenues of development. Rei especially - there aren't any clones in this story! (Or are there?). I've tried my best, though, and I hope I've done at least an alright job.  
不得不说，我觉得写这些角色最难的地方在于，《新世纪福音战士》（以及一定程度上，《新剧场版》）对角色的塑造如此深入，以至于要将他们从原有的背景、故事和成长轨迹中抽离出来，同时保持角色的完整性，并允许新的发展方向，似乎是不可能的。特别是绫波丽——这个故事里可没有克隆人！（或者真的没有？）尽管如此，我已经尽力了，希望我的表现至少还算过得去。**

**Part 4 第四部分**

"Goethe, the German novelist, wrote that quartets are like 'four rational people conversing'. Of course, he was writing about string quartets, but I think the point still stands." Kaji says, standing before Asuka and the rest of her group.  
“德国小说家歌德曾写道，四重奏就像‘四个理性的人在交谈’。当然，他指的是弦乐四重奏，但我认为这个观点依然成立。” 薰站在明日香和她的团队面前说道。

It's been a week since the start of the semester and the chamber groups have finally begun meeting up to practice together. Asuka bit her tongue when Kaji showed the group the practice room. It is a cramped place full of instruments and tables, desks and chairs, and an assortment of nameless junk, all of which has been pushed to the sides and to the back to clear an empty space in the center. They are seated on cold, cushion-less metal folding chairs that creak like the joints of elderly people with every shift and movement. She's sure that the acoustics of the room are about as good as those in a screaming crowd.  
开学已过一周，室内乐小组终于开始聚集起来一起练习。当薰向大家展示练习室时，明日香咬了咬舌头。那是一个狭小的空间，堆满了乐器、桌椅和各种无名杂物，所有东西都被推到两边和后面，以便在中间腾出一块空地。他们坐在冰冷无垫的金属折叠椅上，每动一下，椅子就吱嘎作响，仿佛是老人的关节。她确信这房间的音响效果和嘈杂的人群中差不多。

"What he really meant was that you four have to listen to one another when you play. You have to respond to one another, correct one another, learn how to lead and how to follow. Not to mention, you have to share in the mood the music makes, and the tone and the tempo. Goethe was right - it's just like a conversation."  
他真正想说的是，你们四个人在演奏时必须相互倾听。你们要相互回应，相互纠正，学会如何引领和跟随。更不用说，你们还要共同感受音乐营造的情绪、音调和节奏。歌德说得对——这就像是一场对话。

It's all nonsense, as far as Asuka's concerned. She crosses her arms, rolls her eyes, looking every bit the teenager she is. She knows that every group needs a leader - even orchestras have a First Chair or _Konzertmeister_ if you disregard the conductor. And Asuka intends to lead this group whether they want it or not. There's no other way, not if she wants to prove that she carries something special inside of her. And she does - she knows that too, because there aren't any other options that would make life worth living.  
对明日香来说，这一切都是无稽之谈。她双臂交叉，翻了个白眼，活脱脱一个青春期少女的模样。她明白，每个团队都需要一个领导者——即使忽略指挥，交响乐团也有首席或乐团首席。而明日香打算领导这个团队，无论他们是否愿意。没有其他办法，如果她想证明自己内心拥有某种特别的东西。她确实有——她也知道这一点，因为没有其他选择能让生活变得有价值。

Kaji has them play Mahler's _Piano Quartet in A Minor_ first. The piece's melancholic tones ring hollow in the crowded classroom, and though she is mostly paying attention to what she's playing, Asuka keeps mental notes on the styles and techniques of the rest of her group. Shinji, sitting across from her, has already missed a few notes and whether or not he knows this isn't clear to Asuka. His cello is low and resonant, and each mistake is like the squeak of a wet sneaker against a solid floor, even when he doesn't react. Kaworu sits behind the group pounding away at the piano keys. She can see him out of the corner of her eye, and while his overall skill is probably the highest after hers, the almost flamboyant way he moves - some carnival musician, or a Liberace impersonator - the way his fingers and hands and arms and face are so open and exuberant as they hop, skip, and jump across the keys is so infuriating that Asuka has half a mind to slam the cover of the piano over his digits. And then, beside her, is Rei. Rei might as well be the harbinger of automated musicians. Her style is, at best, robotic, and at worse absolutely soulless. Every movement is measured for efficiency and accuracy, and in that she succeeds; she is perfectly in time and hits each note without a single mistake. But there is nothing there, nothing there at all that is human or expressive or real in her mechanical style. Asuka would find it sad if she weren't already so fed up with this ghost of a girl who has slipped in and out of her life far more often than she would've liked.  
卡吉首先让他们演奏马勒的 A 小调钢琴四重奏。这首曲子的忧郁音调在拥挤的教室里显得空洞，尽管明日香主要专注于自己的演奏，但她仍不忘留意其他组员的风格和技巧。坐在她对面的真嗣已经漏掉了几个音符，他是否意识到这一点，明日香不得而知。他的大提琴低沉而响亮，每个错误都像湿漉漉的运动鞋在坚硬地板上的摩擦声，即便他本人没有反应。薰坐在他们后面，猛击着钢琴键。她能从眼角瞥见他，尽管他的整体技艺可能仅次于她，但他那近乎浮夸的动作——像是狂欢节的乐手，或是李伯拉斯模仿者——手指、手、手臂和面部表情在琴键上跳跃、跳跃、跳跃时如此开放和热情洋溢，令人恼火至极，明日香真想把钢琴盖砸在他的手指上。而坐在她旁边的零，或许可以说是自动演奏乐器的先驱。她的风格，说得最好，也是机械化的，说得最差，则是毫无灵魂。 她的每一个动作都经过精确计算，以追求效率和准确性，在这点上她做得无可挑剔；她的节奏完美无误，每个音符都准确无误。然而，她的演奏中却缺乏人性、表现力或真实感，那机械的风格中空无一物。如果明日香不是早已对这位如幽灵般频繁出入她生活的女孩感到厌烦，她或许会觉得这很可悲。

"You're playing a little too excitedly, Asuka. Slow it down a bit - listen to how slowly Shinji draws his bow across the strings. Mahler wrote this pace with room to breathe. Use it."  
“你演奏得过于激动了，明日香。稍微放慢一点——听听真嗣是如何缓慢地拉动弓弦的。马勒在谱写这段时留有呼吸的空间。好好利用它。”

Burning indignation flashes against her chest and she almost barks something back to Kaji. She swallows her words like bitter fruit. She needs to be on Kaji's good side, needs to use him and his connections to give herself a leg up and out of this place. A stepping stone into the musical world. And while she has three years until she graduates, she knows that every day counts, and every action ought to be accounted for. Her sharp eyes take a look at the rest of the quartet for any reaction to the criticism, or to her correction. They don't have any, or at least, they don't show it.  
胸中燃起一股怒火，她几乎要反驳回去给加持。但她硬生生地将那些尖锐的话语咽了下去，如同吞下苦涩的果实。她需要站在加持的好感一边，需要利用他及其人脉为自己在这地方谋得一席之地，作为踏入音乐世界的跳板。尽管距离毕业还有三年，她深知每一天都至关重要，每一个举动都应有所考量。她锐利的目光扫视着四重奏的其他成员，观察他们对批评或她改正的反应。他们没有任何表示，至少没有显露出来。

Asuka nods and tries to correct herself, playing the piece as Kaji expects her to. It feels incredibly wrong to hold herself back, to try to control the fire of her passions. She focuses hard on her fingers pressing the strings into the neck of the violin - so hard that even the far-beyond-calloused fingertips are sting in pain. She slows her tempo, and at the same time, her heart begins to beat too fast. But, for the time they play the piece she manages to do it more slowly than before. Her forehead sweats beneath her bangs. Hard as it is to admit, Kaji was right; she felt the true resonance of the melody as she made lighter, less aggressive strokes on the strings, even with the few mistakes she made. How awful, that the man had a point. That she could be corrected by someone without the good sense to shave the stubble lining his jaw.  
明日香点头，试图纠正自己，按照加持的期望演奏这首曲子。压抑自己的激情，试图控制内心的火焰，这种感觉极其不对劲。她用力将手指压在琴弦上，紧贴小提琴的颈部——用力到连早已磨出老茧的指尖都感到刺痛。她放慢了节奏，与此同时，心跳开始加速。然而，在演奏这首曲子时，她设法比之前更慢了。额头的汗水在刘海下渗出。尽管难以承认，但加持是对的；当她用更轻柔、不那么激进的拨弦方式演奏时，即使出现了一些错误，她也感受到了旋律真正的共鸣。多么糟糕，那个男人竟然说中了。她竟能被一个连下巴胡茬都不刮的人纠正。

When the daily practice comes to an end, Asuka is out of the classroom before everyone else even notices. She slips through the door with her head held high and doesn't wait for any of her quartet peers regardless of the fact that they're all headed to the same place. They all share the same classes and the same schedule, something that, only a week into her semester, already weighs Asuka down with the necessity of her having to keep that anger of hers fresh and kindled, ready to flare at each and every one of them if they bother her for the slightest thing. Except for Rei. For Rei, she holds nothing but cold contempt.  
每日练习结束之际，明日香总在众人尚未察觉时便已离开教室。她昂首阔步地穿过门扉，不等待任何四重奏同伴，尽管他们同路而行。他们共享课程与日程，仅开学一周，这份共同之处已让明日香感到沉重，她必须时刻保持内心的怒火鲜活燃烧，随时准备对任何微小的打扰爆发。唯独对绫波，她怀有的只是冰冷的蔑视。

Asuka rounds a corner. The hallways are packed like a busy restaurant kitchen. Sweltering, messy, and bustling. She shoves her way into the hall as best she can, all elbows and shoulders, pushing back against the mass of bodies that push back at her. Asuka's ego is large. Her body is not. She shoves against one student and is shoved back too hard this time. Her feet slip from underneath her and screech loudly on the overly waxed floor. When she falls to the floor her knees burn. Her violin case skids across the floor one way; her bookbag slides across the other. No one in the crowd stops to help her. Asuka's pride burns more than her skinned knees, and for an extended moment she stays there on the ground gathering up the will to move, the will to do anything but slam a fist into the floor and cry out at the unfairness of her life.  
明日香拐过一个转角。走廊里人满为患，如同繁忙的餐厅厨房一般。闷热、杂乱、喧闹。她尽可能地挤进走廊，用尽肘部和肩膀的力量，与那些同样推挤她的人群抗衡。明日香的自我很大，但她的身体并不大。她推搡着一名学生，这次却被推得太狠，双脚从身下滑脱，在过度打蜡的地板上发出尖锐的摩擦声。当她跌倒在地时，膝盖火辣辣地疼。她的提琴盒朝一个方向滑去；书包则滑向另一个方向。人群中没有人停下来帮助她。明日香的骄傲比擦伤的膝盖更让她痛苦，她躺在地上好一会儿，积聚起行动的意志，去做任何事情，而不是一拳砸向地板，对生活的不公大喊大叫。

"What are you looking at?" she glares at the few students who'd seen her stumble. Idiots. Her knees sting as she lifts herself off of the ground. She's dusting herself off when a soft voice, sounding as though it floated in from nowhere, breaks into her attention.  
“你在看什么？”她瞪着那几个目睹她跌倒的学生。一群白痴。当她从地上站起来时，膝盖刺痛。她正在拍打身上的灰尘，这时一个柔和的声音，仿佛从无处飘来，打断了她的注意力。

"Here." “给。”

And it's surprising - awful, embarrassing, and surprising - when, standing before her, Rei holds out the violin case and bookbag. Rei's standing far and extending her arms out, like she's afraid that Asuka might pounce on her. For good measure, really; Asuka almost does. Falling bruised her pride - this is like being stabbed.  
而这一切令人惊讶——糟糕、尴尬且惊讶——当站在她面前时，绫波递出了小提琴盒和书包。绫波站得远远的，伸出手臂，仿佛害怕明日香会扑向她。确实，明日香几乎要这么做了。跌倒已经伤了她的自尊——这简直像是被刺了一刀。

Asuka rips her things from Rei's hands without so much as a thank you. Rei's skin is cold where Asuka fingers touch as she grabs for her things. Cold and smooth, and blemish-less in a way that only spurns on Asuka's thoughts that no, there's no way this girl is human. She's a marble statue, a vinyl figurine brought to life by some sick Pygmalion. Rei startles back, looking unsure of what to do with her hands, but by that point Asuka is stomping back down the halls, only this time with more fire in her step, anger almost cracking the ground beneath her. Students part for her like her ashamed embarrassment is physically pushing them back.  
明日香毫不客气地从绫波手中夺回自己的东西，连声谢谢都没有。在抓取东西时，明日香手指触碰到的绫波的皮肤冰冷而光滑，毫无瑕疵，这更加激起了明日香的想法：不，这个女孩绝不可能是人类。她是一座大理石雕像，一个被某种病态的皮格马利翁赋予生命的乙烯基玩偶。绫波惊慌地后退，看起来不知道手该放在哪里，但那时明日香已经怒气冲冲地沿着走廊大步走去，这次她的步伐中带着更多的怒火，愤怒几乎要震裂脚下的地面。学生们像被她羞愧的尴尬感物理上推开一样，纷纷为她让路。

Rei's face had been open when she handed Asuka her things back. Open, vulnerable, a crease of the eyebrow and her pale pink lips parted, all asking a voiceless question of good faith, of sympathy, that Asuka, with her rage as a blindfold, ignored. If she began to pity the girl now - if she began to even give her the time of day, then who would she be?  
当绫波将东西还给明日香时，她的面容是敞开的。敞开、脆弱，眉间微蹙，淡粉色的嘴唇微张，无声地询问着信任与同情，而明日香，被愤怒蒙蔽了双眼，对此视而不见。如果她现在开始怜悯这个女孩——如果她开始甚至给予她一点关注，那她会变成谁？

She'd be normal. 她会变得普通。

Asuka can't be normal. Asuka has to be extraordinary  
明日香不能普通。明日香必须是超凡的。

**Part 5 第五部分**

Asuka is alone in the dorm room for what might actually be the first time since school began. If Asuka barely has a life outside of classes here on campus, then Rei is actually lifeless; the girl rarely leaves her bed when they don't have classes - whether she's reading, or napping, or staring out of the window with a gaze bordering on mindless. The only thing Asuka's seen her doing besides that has been wandering through the halls where the practice rooms are without an obvious goal. Maybe listening to other people play. Maybe sleepwalking through life. Asuka's learned to write her out, erase her presence almost entirely. She hardly even hears the girl breathing anymore. It's white noise. Drowned out, as are the few times she thought she heard sniffling cries in the dead of night when she, herself, couldn't sleep and held back her own unshed tears.  
自从学校开学以来，明日香可能真的是第一次独自在宿舍房间里。如果明日香在校园外几乎没有生活，那么绫波实际上是无生命的；当她们没有课时，女孩很少离开她的床——无论是阅读、小憩，还是用近乎茫然的目光凝视窗外。明日香唯一见她做的其他事情就是在练习室所在的走廊里徘徊，没有明显的目的。也许是在听别人演奏。也许是在生活中梦游。明日香已经学会了忽略她，几乎完全抹去了她的存在。她几乎再也听不到女孩的呼吸声了。那是白噪音。淹没了，就像她在深夜无法入睡时，自己抑制住未流出的泪水，偶尔听到的抽泣声一样。

But right now she's all alone, and worse than that, she feels all alone.  
但现在她完全独自一人，更糟糕的是，她感到孤立无援。

Asuka pulls an old toy of hers from the bottom of the dented cardboard box she'd shipped her belongings in and hadn't yet cleared out. It's a small cloth doll in a red dress, with hair of stringy yarn and a head so big it seems to nod, wearing a wide smile that is stitched onto its face. She grips it tightly until her knuckles turn white, and then she brings it close to her chest and holds it as if it were a real child. She shoves the doll back out at arms length, gazes into those black button eyes. Hates it. Hates it, but loves it and needs it. A frustrated growl rips from her throat.  
明日香从她寄来的破旧纸箱底部翻出一个旧玩具，那箱子她还没来得及整理。这是一个穿着红裙子的小布偶，头发是用细绳般的纱线做的，头大得似乎总在点头，脸上缝着一个大大的微笑。她紧紧抓住它，直到指关节发白，然后把它紧紧抱在胸前，仿佛它是一个真正的孩子。她又将布偶推到一臂之遥，凝视着那对黑色纽扣眼睛。她恨它，却又爱它，需要它。一声挫败的低吼从她喉咙中撕裂而出。

It was a gift from her mother, just like her musical skills. Before whatever used to be her mother disappeared and left the caustic, delusional shell of a person behind. Genius is often said to go along with some form of mental illness or another, and to this day Asuka doesn't know which came first, or if she's walking around with the same timer tick-tick-ticking away in her head. She holds the doll up at eye level, remembers the strength it gave her at that exhibition in Germany, her mother's homeland and the shining spearhead of musical paradise she has held in her head for her whole life.  
这是她母亲送的礼物，就像她的音乐才能一样。在她母亲不知何故消失，留下那个刻薄、妄想的空壳之前。人们常说天才往往伴随着某种精神疾病，直到今天，明日香也不知道哪个先来，或者她是否也在自己的脑海中走着同样的倒计时。她将布偶举到眼前，回忆起在德国那次展览中它给予她的力量，那是她母亲的祖国，也是她一生中音乐天堂的闪亮尖端。

She best remembers the lights in the place, all trained on her in the tasteful black dress that made her feel, finally, like a professional. Like an adult. Uncountable faces looked on in wonder as she played for the crowd, her wrist sawing with the bow at the taught, vibrating strings, all of the feelings in her body loosened into the atmosphere like a cloud filling the auditorium. She was only one of ten children chosen for this exhibition, but she knew it, and she knew that they knew it: that she was the best there. That she'd be on that stage again: a solo performance, every seat sold out months in advance.  
她最难忘的是那个地方的灯光，全都聚焦在她身上，她穿着那件得体的黑色连衣裙，终于让她感觉自己像个专业人士，像个成年人。无数面孔带着惊奇注视着她为人群演奏，她的手腕随着弓在紧绷、震动的弦上移动，她体内的所有情感都像云朵一样释放到空气中，填满了整个礼堂。她只是被选中的十个孩子之一，但她知道，他们也知道：她是那里最出色的。她知道她还会再次登上那个舞台：一场独奏，每张票都会在几个月前售罄。

Asuka all but swoons. She spins the doll around in her arms and lands on her bed, holding the doll up into the air as the future flutters before her like a butterfly always just barely out of grasp, but never so far, or so fast, that catching it seems impossible. Her heart feels like warm honey at the thought of how far she'll go one day. If only it would come sooner, she thinks, then she could leave all of this behind - Kaji and those two buffons, and Rei, and this whole crooked, crumbling school.  
明日香几乎要陶醉了。她抱着娃娃在床上旋转，将娃娃高高举起，未来在她面前像一只蝴蝶般翩翩起舞，总是差一点就能抓住，但永远不会太远或太快，以至于捕捉它似乎是不可能的。一想到将来她能走多远，她的心就像温暖的蜂蜜一样。如果这一切能早点到来就好了，她想，那样她就可以抛下这一切——加持和那两个傻瓜，还有绫波，以及这整个歪歪斜斜、摇摇欲坠的学校。

"Well, I won't get there without practicing." she says to the doll. Held above her head, it seems to nod back to her with that ceaseless smile. Asuka lifts her arm to dump the doll back in the box, but something stops her. Her eyes itch to shed frustrated tears. A breath, and then she hides the doll beside her pillow, up against the cold wall her bed leans against.  
"嗯，不练习我是到不了那里的。" 她对玩偶说道。高举过头，玩偶似乎带着那永恒的微笑向她点头回应。明日香抬起手臂，正要将玩偶放回盒中，却突然停住了。她的眼睛发痒，泪水几欲夺眶而出。深吸一口气后，她将玩偶藏在了枕头旁，紧贴着冰冷的墙壁，她的床就靠在那里。

She doesn't want to bury her mother twice.  
她不想两次埋葬自己的母亲。

---

Twenty minutes pass and she hasn't found a suitable spot to practice. The stupid school has a surprising lack of the kind of hidden spots she always chose for that job - no dark corners, no roof access, not even an unused staircase where her notes might sound like they're climbing along with the scale she plays. Forget waiting until she dies to get access to a stuffy, claustrophobic closet of a room like everyone else. The school grounds themselves, featureless, nary a tree in sight except for at the edges, hiding the school gate that surrounds the perimeter, is too wide and windy to play in either. Every time she discovers something new about the place she hates it more. It's nothing like the state-of-the-art Tokyo-3 Conservatory promised to her in pamphlets.  
二十分钟过去了，她还没找到合适的练习地点。这愚蠢的学校竟然出奇地缺乏她以往常选的那种隐蔽角落——没有昏暗的角落，没有屋顶通道，甚至连一个废弃的楼梯间都没有，她的琴声在那里或许能像音阶一样攀爬。别提等到死后才能进入像其他人那样的闷热、令人窒息的小房间了。学校的场地本身，毫无特色，除了边缘处几乎看不到一棵树，那里的树木遮挡着环绕四周的校门，太过宽阔且风大，也不适合演奏。每当她发现这个地方的新一面，她就更加厌恶它。这与宣传册中承诺给她的东京-3 音乐学院完全不同。

Asuka finds the school's auditorium soon enough. She walks in through the back door. A single set of lights illuminates the stage rising from the pit that the gradually descending seats lead to. She sneezes; the room is dusty, like it hasn't been opened or cleaned since the former semester passed, or maybe even the one before. She's not sure if this is off-limits, but already she's taken a liking to the place. Asuka walks down to the stage and climbs up, standing in the center beneath the lights. She spins, looking out at the empty seats and imagining them full, looking up at the lights, imitation sunspears warming her skin.  
明日香很快就找到了学校的礼堂。她从后门走进去，一束灯光照亮了从逐渐下降的座位通向的舞台坑中升起的舞台。她打了个喷嚏，房间里满是灰尘，仿佛自从上个学期，甚至更早之前，这里就未曾开启或打扫过。她不确定这里是否禁止进入，但已经对这地方产生了好感。明日香走向舞台并爬上去，站在灯光中心，旋转着，望向空荡的座位，想象它们座无虚席，抬头看向灯光，仿若阳光的光束温暖着她的肌肤。

But something catches her eye from above. There, in crossing paths and elevated platforms, is the catwalk where tech crews would set up spotlights, adjust the curtain and the like. Quiet, isolated, and strange - the perfect place to practice. Asuka searches backstage for the ladder access the area; it's an old thing, rusting in some places, creaking in others, and she gathers her courage to make it to the top. There, the catwalks spread out like spiderwebs, girded iron protected with thin rails. At the end of one, one that sits right above center stage, is a solid platform perfect for her practice. Unconcerned with getting caught, her footsteps echo with a metal twang as she walks the length of the path to end.  
但有什么东西从上方吸引了她的目光。在那里，交错的路线和高架平台上，是技术团队会设置聚光灯、调整幕布等的地方——猫道。安静、孤立且奇特——是练习的完美场所。明日香在后台寻找通往该区域的梯子；那是个老旧的东西，有些地方生锈，有些地方吱吱作响，她鼓起勇气爬到顶部。在那里，猫道像蜘蛛网一样展开，由带薄栏杆的铁梁加固。在其中一个的尽头，正好位于舞台中央正上方，有一个坚固的平台，非常适合她练习。她毫不担心被发现，脚步声随着金属的叮当声在路径上回响，直到终点。

"Perfect." she says to herself.  
“完美。”她自言自语道。

All alone, at the highest point she can reach, and center stage, Asuka feels in her element. She pulls her violin from the case lovingly, her hand caressing the smooth, rosy wood, and begins to play to an audience she imagines is watching, cheering, even crying at the divine music coiling off the strings - swooping notes and shimmering chords, a harmony of one. Mostly. She corrects what few mistakes she makes each time, but they still seem to chip away at something she cannot begin to put into words that lurks, crawling, deep within her chest.  
独自一人，站在她所能及的最高点，也是舞台的中心，明日香感觉如鱼得水。她从琴盒中温柔地取出小提琴，手指轻抚着光滑的玫瑰色木头，开始演奏，想象着观众在注视，欢呼，甚至因那从琴弦上盘旋而出的神圣音乐而感动落泪——那是起伏的音符和闪烁的和弦，一种和谐的独奏。大多时候如此。她每次都会纠正那几个错误，但这些错误似乎仍在侵蚀着某种她无法言说的东西，那东西潜伏在她的胸中，悄然爬行。

When the end of the day flips over into evening she leaves her perch, burying the confusion as the clouds conceal the sun, a candle snuffed, a single ember dying off the wick, lighting her way back to the dorms.  
当一天的尾声翻转为傍晚时，她离开了她的高台，将困惑埋藏，如同云层遮蔽了太阳，一盏烛火被吹灭，一根灯芯上的余烬熄灭，照亮她返回宿舍的路。

**Part 6 第六部分**

"Asuka." "明日香。"

The voice cuts in from the dark of sleep. It's ethereal and short lived, like a cloud of breath on a winter morning. Behind the voice comes a more annoying sound - some buzzing or screeching repeating over and over like an alarm clock. Asuka's sleep is always deep and ever troubled; whatever happens outside rarely wakes her up.  
那声音从沉睡的黑暗中切入。它飘渺而短暂，如同冬日清晨的一团呼气。紧随声音之后的是一种更烦人的声响——某种嗡嗡或尖叫，反复不断，就像闹钟一样。明日香的睡眠总是深沉且充满困扰；外界发生的事情很少能将她唤醒。

But it's too early for that, and she knows it before she awakens to a room barely brighter than the darkness behind her closed eyelids. It's not her alarm clock, that's for certain. But the noise is still wailing. Worse still, she sees Rei standing above her. Little in life is worse than being woken up in the middle of a deep sleep; when the person waking you up is someone you hate, it's hell.  
但现在还太早，她甚至在醒来之前就知道，房间的光线几乎和闭眼后的黑暗一样暗淡。那肯定不是她的闹钟。但噪音仍在哀鸣。更糟糕的是，她看到绫波站在她上方。生活中很少有比在深度睡眠中被唤醒更糟的事；如果唤醒你的人是你讨厌的人，那简直是地狱。

"What are you doing?!" She growls out. She feels a hand leave her shoulder, and realizes that Rei had also been shaking her awake. It's almost enough to make her want to burn the shirt she sleeps in. "What time is it? Why are you even on this side of the room?!"  
“你在干什么？！”她咆哮道。她感觉到一只手从她的肩膀上移开，意识到绫波也一直在摇晃她醒来。这几乎让她想要烧掉自己睡觉时穿的衬衫。“现在几点了？你为什么在这边房间里？！”

It's hard to make out anything in the dark of the night, let alone the fleeting emotions of her robotic roommate, but there's a quick flash of hurt, or maybe dismay on Ayanami's face. Best to ignore it, Asuka thinks, sitting up in bed. Now that she can focus, she hears a crowd passing her door river-like, gushing voices and rushing footsteps.  
在夜色的掩护下，很难看清任何东西，更别提她那机器人室友转瞬即逝的情绪了，但绫波的脸上确实闪过一丝受伤，或也许是失望。最好忽略它，明日香想着，从床上坐起来。现在她能集中注意力了，听到一群人像河流般经过她的门口，声音汹涌，脚步匆匆。

"There's a fire," Rei says, slipping on a pair of sandals she keeps by her bed. She reaches then for a small blanket, wraps it around her shoulders. "Or a fire drill." All thoughts of danger stop for a moment when, in the shadow-light of night, sleepy-eyed and dressed in nothing but a thin white sweater and a pair of athletic shorts, Asuka almost - almost - thinks that Rei Ayanami is cute.  
“有火灾，”绫波说，穿上床边的一双凉鞋。然后她拿起一条小毯子，披在肩上。“或者是消防演习。”当夜色中的阴影里，睡眼惺忪，只穿着一件薄薄的白色毛衣和一条运动短裤的明日香，几乎——几乎是觉得绫波·绫波丽很可爱时，所有关于危险的念头都暂时停止了。

She wants to slap herself for it. In lieu of thanking the girl for waking her up Asuka rips the covers off of herself and runs a hand through her hair. She ignores Rei and pulls open the door, noting that the hallway is nearly empty already, that the last of their dorm-mates have already left. Rei stayed behind for her. She tastes something bitter when she swallows down the thought that she would not have done the same for Rei.  
她想为此给自己一巴掌。没有感谢女孩叫醒她，明日香扯掉自己的被子，用手梳理了一下头发。她无视了绫波，打开门，注意到走廊几乎已经空了，最后一批室友已经离开。绫波为了她留了下来。当她咽下这个念头——她不会为绫波做同样的事时，尝到了一丝苦涩。

Hearts beat strangely under pressure, misshaping themselves with with every squeeze and strain. Asuka stands at the door she opens and feels Rei's stare asking questions that ghostly voice never would. "I don't think it's a real fire. There's no smoke." She opens the door wider but doesn't yet step out. "Are you coming or not?"  
在压力下，心脏跳动得异常，每一次挤压和拉扯都使其变形。明日香站在打开的门前，感受到绫波的目光在询问，那幽灵般的声音却从未如此。“我不认为这是真的火灾。没有烟。”她将门开得更大，但还未迈出脚步。“你来不来？”

They step out into the chilly night. It's a deeper indigo, nothing like the black sky her room had promised; the moon is a chalk circle drawn hastily, the craters and trenches too white, the thing itself hovering too large and too close over the brick school building and squat dorms. Students and faculty have grouped themselves up into loose collectives like spreading continents, and Asuka finds Shinji and Kaworu standing off to the side of the shivering, chattering students, an islet visible from the coast. Torn between wanting to stand alone and giving Rei the gift of not shooing her away as an unspoken thanks, Asuka makes her way over to the boys, huddled close against the wind chill.  
他们踏入寒冷的夜色中。夜空是深邃的靛蓝，与她房间所预示的漆黑截然不同；月亮像匆忙画出的粉笔圈，陨石坑和沟壑过于苍白，它本身悬在砖砌的校舍和低矮的宿舍上方，显得太大太近。学生和教职工已经自发聚集成松散的群体，如同扩散的大陆板块，而明日香发现真嗣和渚薰站在瑟瑟发抖、窃窃私语的学生旁边，像是从海岸可见的孤岛。她犹豫于想要独自站立和给予绫波不驱赶她的礼物之间，作为无声的感谢，明日香向那两个男孩走去，他们紧靠在一起抵御寒风。

"Good evening? Or good morning?" Kaworu laughs easily. He has an arm around Shinji's shoulder, and the smaller boy is red enough to be burning a fever. Asuka doesn't even fight the desire to roll her eyes. She'd seen their furtive looks across the practice room, watched their closeness coalesce into something grander, and now here is the final point - they're together. She can see it clearly without being told a word, and it sickens her. They have no passion for music if they're wasting it on love.  
"晚上好？还是早上好？" 薰轻松地笑着。他的一只手臂搭在真嗣的肩上，而真嗣的脸红得像是发烧了一样。明日香甚至懒得掩饰自己翻白眼的冲动。她早已注意到他们在练习室里偷偷摸摸的眼神交流，目睹了他们之间的亲密逐渐凝聚成某种更宏大的东西，而现在，这一刻终于到来——他们在一起了。她无需任何言语就能清楚地看出这一点，这让她感到恶心。如果他们把精力浪费在爱情上，那么他们对音乐的热情也就荡然无存了。

"This better be over soon." she huffs, folding her arms across her chest to keep herself warm. Shinji looks at her like he wants to say something, but a squeeze around the shoulders silences him, brings him back into the little bubble he shares with Kaworu, who has already given up on getting anything else out of Asuka.  
"希望这一切快点结束。" 她气呼呼地说，双臂交叉抱在胸前以保持温暖。真嗣看着她，似乎想说些什么，但肩膀上的一紧让他闭上了嘴，将他拉回到与薰共享的小小世界中，而薰已经放弃了从明日香那里得到任何回应。

"I'm sure it will be," Rei answers her. A first, really. It's the kind of surprise that comes from the breaking of a pattern. "It's cold out tonight." She pulls the blanket tighter and rubs the top of one arm with her hand, shrugging away at the cold like it should take a hint.  
"我相信很快就会结束的，" 绫波回答她。这真是第一次。这种惊喜来自于打破常规。"今晚外面很冷。" 她拉紧了毯子，用手摩擦着一只手臂的顶部，耸肩试图驱散寒冷，仿佛寒冷应该识趣地离开。

It's only pride that stops Asuka from asking to share the blanket with Rei. A chill has already seeped deep beneath her skin and nestled somewhere close to her heart. She shivers. The goosebumps on her skin raise like little hills, and she feels each as she rubs her arms for heat. Rei sits down on the frosty grass ignoring the wetness and cold as if she can't feel physical sensations the way Asuka has convinced herself the girl doesn't feel anything emotionally. Pale moonlight, a kind of dusty white, settles itself in Rei's hair like a halo, and where it falls on her equally pale skin it gives her an ethereal glow. Asuka's thought this before, but Rei has the look of someone who could, at any moment, vanish or dissolve into nothingness, into the very air she's breathing. Curled up on the ground Rei's frail form is even smaller, more fragile looking. It stirs something nameless in Asuka. Maybe pity. Maybe sadness. Maybe care.  
唯有自尊心阻止明日香开口请求与绫波共享毛毯。寒意已悄然渗入她的肌肤，蜷缩在心房附近。她颤抖着，皮肤上的鸡皮疙瘩如同小丘般隆起，每当她摩擦双臂取暖时，都能感受到它们的存在。绫波无视湿冷，坐在霜冻的草地上，仿佛感受不到肉体上的触感，正如明日香坚信这个女孩在情感上无所感知一样。苍白的月光，带着一种尘埃般的白色，在绫波的发丝间安顿下来，宛如光环；当它洒落在她同样苍白的肌肤上时，赋予了她一种超凡脱俗的光辉。明日香曾这样想过，绫波看起来随时都可能消失或溶解于无形，融入她所呼吸的空气中。蜷缩在地上的绫波，那脆弱的身形更显渺小、易碎。这触动了明日香心中某种难以名状的情感，或许是怜悯，或许是悲伤，又或许是关怀。

Asuka looks away. She can't waste anymore time on thinking about the girl, or about anything that isn't music. Even now, in the middle of the night, she tries to focus on the notes she can see in her head, on the movement of her fingers against the thin cloth of the over-sized t-shirt she calls pajamas. It's too cold for that, though, and when a cutting wind begins to blow she has no choice but to sit beside Rei and curl her arms around her knees to keep some warmth in.  
明日香转过头去。她不能再浪费时间去想那个女孩，或者任何与音乐无关的事情。即便此刻已是深夜，她仍试图专注于脑海中浮现的音符，以及手指在宽松 T 恤（她称之为睡衣）薄布料上的移动。然而，天气太冷了，当一阵刺骨的寒风开始吹拂时，她别无选择，只能坐到绫波旁边，双臂环抱膝盖以保持温暖。

Asuka hears Kaji's voice behind her; he must've come up to talk to Shinji and Kaworu. He says something about a field trip he's planning for the chamber groups and Asuka scoffs. Useless, like so much else that happens here. A useless distraction.  
明日香听到身后传来加持的声音；他一定是上来找真嗣和渚薰谈话的。他提到了他为室内乐团计划的一次实地考察，明日香嗤之以鼻。无用之举，就像这里发生的许多其他事情一样。一个无谓的干扰。

"We don't need one of those," she twists her body to look behind her. Kaji's lazy smile lights up his face, and his ever-present stubble is illuminated in profile. "All we need is to practice more. My mother, she - "  
“我们不需要那种东西，”她扭动身体向后看去。加持慵懒的笑容点亮了他的脸庞，他那始终存在的胡茬在侧脸轮廓中清晰可见。“我们所需要的只是更多练习。我的母亲，她——”

"I know about your mother. Wonderful player, she was." Kaji cuts her off. "Really, a shame she passed."  
"我知道你母亲的事。她是个出色的选手。" 薰打断了她。"真的，她去世真是可惜。"

"What do you know about that? What do you know about her?" Asuka growls out, low and tinkling like broken glass. She tears at the grass beneath her hands unthinkingly, and then at the dirt below it until it lines the inside of her nails.  
"你了解什么？你了解她什么？" 明日香低声咆哮，声音清脆却带着破碎的质感。她无意识地撕扯着手下的草地，接着是泥土，直到指甲缝里塞满了泥土。

"I met her once, actually. Some big tour I was on as a student, maybe your age."  
"实际上，我曾见过她一次。当时我参加了一个大型巡回赛，大概和你现在年纪相仿。"

In the darkness, standing above her, Asuka couldn't make out his face. She wants to stand up and punch him, and then maybe punch herself to give those tears in her eyes a reason to be there. She hated her mother, but she respected her. Or her skill. There are days when she isn't sure if she misses the woman, or the music that would flow from the balcony on warm summer days as if carried by the very sunbeams, or if she hates her more because the woman just had to plunge off the deep end of madness and the seat of a chair in a hospital room.  
在黑暗中，站在她上方，明日香看不清他的脸。她想站起来给他一拳，然后或许再给自己一拳，好让眼中的泪水有个存在的理由。她恨她的母亲，但也尊敬她。或者说，尊敬她的技艺。有些日子里，她不确定自己是想念那个女人，还是想念那些在温暖夏日从阳台流淌出的音乐，仿佛被阳光直接携带着，亦或是她更恨她，因为那个女人不得不陷入疯狂的深渊，坐在医院病房的一把椅子上。

Kaji had no right to speak of her at all, though. When Asuka stands up, fists balled and shaking, it's a pressure on her legs that stops her rampage like an iron clamp. Rei, with those porcelain fingers, has a steady, firm grip so unlike the airy formlessness of the rest of the girl. But Asuka doesn't notice this, not at the time. All she feels is shock. Rage. Whatever of it was turned towards Kaji is doubled and aimed at Rei, who looks to be trying to say something without moving her lips.  
然而，加持根本无权谈论她。当明日香站起来，拳头紧握，颤抖着，是腿上的压力像铁钳一样阻止了她的暴走。绫波，用那如瓷器般的手指，有着稳定而坚定的握力，与她其余部分的飘渺无形截然不同。但明日香当时并未注意到这一点。她感受到的只有震惊。愤怒。原本对准加持的怒火翻倍，转而指向绫波，后者似乎正试图不动嘴唇地说些什么。

"Get off!" Asuka violently pulls her leg out of the grip and stomps off. The grass behind her is flattened by her feet and petrified in the night frost. She feels their eyes boring into her back without looking and it isn't until she's standing at the school gates - her rage disarmed like a soldier stripped of a gun - that she realizes her lack of a plan.  
"下车！" 明日香猛地抽出被抓住的腿，愤然离去。她身后的草地被脚步压平，在夜霜中凝固。她不用回头也感觉到他们的目光刺在背上，直到她站在学校门口——怒气像被缴械的士兵一样消散——才意识到自己毫无计划。

The breeze is colder now, like running through the steel bars of the gate her makes it frigid. She tries hard not to shiver, not to hear the clatter of her teeth. Showing the wound to the enemy is never an option - even animals know this. Eventually people stop staring at her. Except for Rei. It's too dark to see so far away, but she knows the girl with the rabbit-red eyes has not stopped looking at her.  
此刻的风更冷了，仿佛穿过铁栅门时带上了寒意。她努力不让自己颤抖，不让牙齿发出碰撞声。向敌人展示伤口绝非明智之举——连动物都明白这一点。最终，人们停止了注视。除了绫波。虽然夜色太深，看不清那么远，但她知道那个红眼如兔的女孩仍在注视着她。

When she calms, when the students are allowed back in the dorms, it strikes her that she never yelled at Kaji. What a mistake that would've been, she thinks, it might've ruined everything. But Rei stopped her. Rei knew, Rei read her, and Rei stopped her with a single movement.  
当她平静下来，学生们被允许返回宿舍时，她突然意识到自己从未对加持发火。她心想，那将是多么大的错误，可能会毁掉一切。但绫波阻止了她。绫波了解她，绫波看透了她，仅用一个动作就阻止了她。

Pathetic. A sharp barb in her heart, an arrow from her thoughts. The crowd shrinks as it snakes back into the dormitories. She lingers behind. Her steps are slowed by that sick stickiness that fills the spaces in her heart where the fire of her anger had been snuffed out. When she makes it back to where she'd been standing with Rei she finds the blanket left on the grass, folded neatly, as if waiting for her.  
可悲至极。一句尖刻的讽刺刺入她的心，一支来自她思绪的箭。人群蜿蜒退回宿舍，她却留在了后面。她的步伐因那种令人作呕的黏稠感而变得迟缓，这种感觉填满了她心中愤怒之火被扑灭的空隙。当她回到与丽一起站立的地方时，发现草地上那条毯子被整齐地折叠着，仿佛在等待她。

She hesitates for a second before she picks it up and wraps it around her body. Whatever fleece its made of is warm and stops the cutting wind like a bullet proof vest. It smells of Rei, she realizes, after the undercurrent of lavender and saltwater and something airy which comforts her heart registers as the same scent she smells from the girl's side of the room, or when they're sitting too close in class.  
她犹豫了一秒，然后拾起毯子裹在身上。无论这毯子是用什么绒毛制成的，它都温暖无比，像防弹背心一样阻挡了刺骨的寒风。她意识到，它散发着丽的气息，混合着薰衣草、海水和某种轻盈的气息，这让她感到安心，正是她在女孩房间的另一侧或她们在课堂上坐得太近时闻到的相同香味。

She looks around and glares at nobody. Then, she pulls it tighter around her body.  
她环顾四周，对空无一人的环境怒目而视，随后，她将毯子更紧地裹在身上。

"I think that you can be a bit more reserved here." Kaji pulls the bow across the strings of his own violin more slowly, with a kind of languid patience reserved for wiping away tears after a sad movie. The more beautiful sound grates on her ears, and, leaning back in her chair, she crosses her arms. It feels a bit ridiculous, what with the bow and the violin she holds sticking out like palm fronds, but it's the least she can do without blowing her lid.  
"我觉得你在这里可以稍微含蓄一些。" 卡吉缓缓拉动自己小提琴的弓弦，带着一种慵懒的耐心，就像在悲伤电影后擦去泪水一样。那更美的声音刺痛了她的耳朵，她向后靠在椅子上，双臂交叉。这看起来有点可笑，毕竟她手里还拿着弓和小提琴，像棕榈叶一样伸出来，但这是她能做的最起码的事情，以免爆发。

"Why would I be reserved? This piece, can't you hear the emotion, professor?"  
"我为什么要含蓄？教授，你难道听不出这首曲子的情感吗？"

He looks at her, studying her, hand absentmindedly playing with his stubble. He smells of cigarettes and cologne, the heady mix filling her space when he leans closer to get a better look at her, though she's not sure why. It's distractingly powerful, a scent that triggers some sepia-toned memory of her father. Scent memory is the hardest to scrub from the mind. It slips away with the scent itself, and comes back just as strong whenever the source returns. She hated her father.  
他看着她，仔细打量，手不经意地玩弄着胡茬。他身上散发着香烟和古龙水的混合气味，当他靠近她以便更好地观察时，这股浓烈的气息充满了她的空间，尽管她不明白为什么。这种气味令人分心，强烈地唤起了她对父亲的某种棕褐色记忆。气味记忆是最难从脑海中抹去的。随着气味的消散而溜走，每当源头再次出现时，它又会以同样强烈的姿态回归。她讨厌她的父亲。

"Sometimes the strongest emotion comes through not in the expression, but in what you're holding back. Play it again for me. Try to control the sound a little this time."  
"有时候，最强烈的情感不是通过表情传达，而是通过你抑制的东西。再为我演奏一次。这次试着控制一下声音。"

She glares at him. He is wrong, she knows that, but she follows his instructions because doing what you're told is sometimes easier than doing what you want. As she pulls the bow across the strings she feels full of trepidation. Self-consciousness is in the sweat covering her palm, in the clumsy twist of her fingers. Without the security of the way she habitually plays her confidence falters. Her bow slips and screeches against the wrong string. She nearly curses.  
她怒视着他。她知道他错了，但她还是按照他的指示去做，因为有时候听从命令比做自己想做的事更容易。当她拉动弓弦时，她感到满心忐忑。自我意识体现在她手掌上的汗水，体现在她笨拙扭曲的手指上。没有了她习惯的演奏方式的安全感，她的信心动摇了。她的弓滑了一下，发出刺耳的声音，擦错了弦。她差点咒骂出声。

"It's fine, Asuka. Let's try that from the top."  
"没关系，明日香。我们从头再来一次。"

"It's not fine!" "这可不好！"

Asuka takes a deep breath and lets it out through her nose. The practice room isn't like the one where the quartet plays. This one is small, more of a jail cell than a classroom. The walls are painted a disgusting milky green, giving the base, musty smell a color to associate it with. Scuffs on the floor stretch waxy black from countless chair scrapes. It's all so pedestrian. Distracting. There are no windows to look out of, just the tiny pane of glass in the heavy wooden door like a porthole on a ship.  
明日香深吸一口气，然后从鼻子里呼出。练习室并不像四重奏演奏的那个。这个房间很小，与其说是教室，不如说更像牢房。墙壁涂着令人作呕的乳绿色，给那股发霉的气味赋予了颜色。地板上的划痕因无数次椅子摩擦而变得乌黑发亮。一切都如此平凡，令人分心。没有窗户可以向外看，只有厚重的木门上那块小玻璃，就像船上的舷窗一样。

"Are you alright Asuka? You stopped moving for a second."  
"你还好吗，明日香？你刚才停顿了一下。"

She shakes herself out of her reverie. Centers herself, tries to feel where her emotions bubble from and where they burst. Everything is fire, fire on fire, blue flames and white hot ones, weak little orange lights that seem almost cold in comparison. They rage and roast and roar. Control this - how is she to control this? Her fingers depress the strings in the complex arithmetic music is made up from, but she can feel the desire in her very bones to pull the bow faster, to press her fingers harder. In time, without noticing, she shifts her body while she plays - the music is connected to her muscles, pulls her strings. She'd dance, were she standing. But she holds it back. It hurts to do, to keep a hand on that fire.  
她从沉思中惊醒，调整自己，试图感受情绪从何涌起，又在何处爆发。一切都是火，火上浇油，蓝焰与炽白之火，微弱的橘色光芒相比之下几乎显得冰冷。它们肆虐、炙烤、咆哮。掌控这一切——她该如何掌控？她的手指按在构成音乐的复杂算术般的弦上，但她能感受到骨子里渴望拉弓更快，按弦更重。不知不觉中，她在演奏时调整了身姿——音乐与她的肌肉相连，牵动着她。若她站立，定会随之起舞。但她抑制住了。这样做很痛苦，要一手掌控那火焰。

And then she hears the wrong notes. Feels in her wrists how off-time she is.  
随后，她听到了错音。手腕能感觉到节奏的偏差。

"This isn't working!" Asuka stomps her foot. "How - why does everyone think it's a problem for me to express myself? Look at what happens! Look at what happens when I do that!"  
“这根本行不通！”明日香跺了跺脚。“为什么——为什么大家都认为我表达自己是个问题？看看会发生什么！看看当我这么做时会发生什么！”

Kaji looks at her with an expression full of concern, even hidden behind his usual casual shield, and she feels burned wherever his glance touches. She doesn't want the concern. She doesn't want the pity.  
薰带着满是关切的眼神看着她，即便他平日里随意的伪装也掩盖不住，她感觉他的目光所及之处都灼热无比。她不想要这份关心，也不想要这份怜悯。

"Forget it," she says. "The rest of them - the rest of the quartet. They're going to have to just match up with the way I play instead of the other way around."  
“算了，”她说，“其他人——四重奏的其他成员。他们得适应我的演奏方式，而不是我迁就他们。”

"It's alright not to be perfect, Asuka. No one here expects you to be. You're young, you're learning. This is exactly the time of life when you should be making mistakes."  
“不完美也没关系，明日香。这里没人期望你完美无缺。你还年轻，还在学习。这正是你应该犯错的年纪。”

"But that's the problem! Everyone here is so fine with not being the best they can be! It's sickening," she feels the bile rise in her throat. "Really sickening. I'd rather die than stew in mediocrity. You're our teacher. You're supposed to push us, not coddle us."  
"但问题就在这里！这里的每个人都对不是最好的自己感到满意！真令人作呕，"她感到喉咙里涌起一股酸水。"真的令人作呕。我宁愿死也不愿在平庸中沉沦。你是我们的老师。你应该推动我们，而不是溺爱我们。"

"I like to think I'm supposed to nurture, not push." Kaji answers, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. She watches him feel for a pack of cigarettes in his pocket before he stops, lowering his hand slowly, realizing that he can't smoke in the school building. "Please, try again. Slowly, controlled. Take your time. Paint all of your movements with a tasteful touch of that power inside of you, don't just let everything be an explosion of color."  
"我更愿意认为我的职责是培育，而不是推动。" 卡吉回答道，紧张地揉着后颈。她看着他在口袋里摸索着一包香烟，然后停了下来，慢慢地放下手，意识到他不能在学校建筑内吸烟。"请再试一次。慢慢地，控制好。慢慢来。用你内在力量的那种优雅触感来描绘你所有的动作，不要只是让一切都成为色彩的爆炸。"

"That's stupid." She shakes her head. "These things are supposed to motivate you," She shakes her head, "Energize you."  
"这太愚蠢了。"她摇了摇头。"这些东西本应该激励你，"她摇了摇头，"给你能量。"

A part of Asuka knows that she's making a mistake. Kaji is right, of course, and his point valid. Nothing in life is harder than changing oneself, however; the pain and the process are that of ripping bits of flesh away and watching for the scar tissue to grow into fresh skin shiny and pink, new but a reminder of what was there. She doesn't have that luxury. Her scars are scabbed over, itchy and evident, having never healed.  
明日香的一部分知道她在犯错。当然，加持是对的，他的观点也是合理的。生活中没有什么比改变自己更难的了，然而；那种痛苦和过程就像撕掉肉块，然后等待疤痕组织长成新鲜、粉红、新生的皮肤，虽是新生，却提醒着那里曾经是什么。她没有那种奢侈。她的伤疤已经结痂，痒且明显，从未真正愈合。

The bell rings outside in the hall.  
大厅外响起了铃声。

"Do what you feel you have to do." Kaji stands up slowly. His dark eyes are open and pleading, but he doesn't force her. "Just think about what I said."  
“做你觉得自己必须做的事。”加持缓缓站起身。他深邃的眼睛睁开着，带着恳求，但他没有强迫她。“只是想想我说的。”

She wants to answer with some barbed remark, but the anger has drained into something more bitter and tired. "Sure, I'll think this whole thing over."  
她本想用尖刻的话回应，但怒气已消退，化为更苦涩和疲惫的情绪。“好吧，我会好好考虑这件事的。”

**Part 7 第七部分**

Asuka returns early from one of her solo practice sessions. The late afternoon sun stains everything golden and still, so unlike the troubled tremor of her heart. She'd made more mistakes than usual. At least no one was around to see or hear her; shame can't bloom without the light of other people's eyes. During every group practice it seems that Kaji can see right through her - like he can visualize all of the notes she and the quartet play individually, as indescribable colored strings he can pick and prod at to discover each and every mistake. He often derides Kaworu for sloppy, unnecessary mistakes. When he points out Shinji's, they're often from a lack of power attention or care. Rei's non-emotional play. Asuka agrees with all of that. She just doesn't when Kaji points out her intensity as an issue, or her energy as harm.  
明日香比平时更早地结束了她的个人练习。傍晚的阳光将一切染成了金色，静谧而安详，与她内心的纷乱颤动截然不同。她犯的错误比往常更多。至少周围没有人看到或听到她；没有他人目光的照耀，羞愧便无法生长。每次集体练习时，似乎卡吉都能看穿她——仿佛他能将她和四重奏演奏的每一个音符，以无法言喻的彩色线条形式，挑拣并探究出每一个错误。他经常斥责薰的粗心大意和无谓的错误。当他指出真嗣的错误时，往往是因为缺乏力量、注意力或关心。至于零的非情感演奏，明日香对此都表示认同。只是当卡吉指出她的激烈情绪或她的能量成为问题时，她并不认同。

The dormitory building is empty and silent, as it tends to be during the weekend. Students, allowed two days of freedom, spend their days at local eateries, visiting local sights. Losers, she thinks. People without the drive to be perfect, without the determination to practice whenever they can. As she nears her room she can see a plane of light spreading from the half-opened door. It's odd. Rei, who is always in the room when she's not in class, keeps the door closed sepulcher tight.  
宿舍楼空荡荡的，周末总是如此寂静。学生们获得了两天的自由，纷纷外出到当地餐馆用餐，游览名胜。她心想，真是些没出息的人。那些没有追求完美动力，没有决心随时练习的人。当她走近自己的房间时，看到半开的门缝中透出一道光。这很奇怪。Rei，当她不在课堂上时总是待在房间里，通常会把门关得像坟墓一样紧。

"That's unacceptable." she hears the voice before she passes the threshold and sees the man standing before her roommate. She stands in place for an uneasy moment. A threat? Some outsider who got through the school gates unheeded?  
“这不可接受。”她还没跨过门槛就听到了这个声音，看到一个男人站在她的室友面前。她不安地站了一会儿。是威胁吗？某个未经注意就闯入学校大门的外来者？

He's tall and imposing, the man, dressed about as utilitarian as someone can be. Nondescript. Beige pants, forest green coat, both lacking any definition aside from the solid shape of his body. Asuka can't see his face from where she is because his back is turned. He is standing right in front of Rei like he has to become her whole world to reach her. Like his presence itself is a weapon, is crushing, pascals of pressure pushing down on Rei.  
这个男人高大威严，穿着极为实用，毫无特色。米色裤子，森林绿外套，除了他结实的身体轮廓外，没有任何其他特征。由于他的背对着她，Asuka 无法看到他的脸。他站在 Rei 面前，仿佛必须成为她的整个世界才能触及她。他的存在本身就是一种武器，压迫感十足，仿佛有无数帕斯卡的压力正压在 Rei 身上。

Asuka moves to walk in, but it's at that moment that Rei sees her in the space beneath the man's arms. Her eyes go wide infinitesimally , almost a trick of the light, and she barely shakes her head no, no. Asuka freezes. She considers going in anyway. It isn't as if Rei's opinion has ever meant anything to her. But the look in her eyes: dangerous caution, a teetering fear - it holds Asuka where she is. The subtle expressions, the tiniest fold of Rei's bottom lip where it's being chewed is the loudest warning Asuka can receive. It strikes Asuka the wrong way, a piece of art defaced, and for the first time she allows herself a moment to really think about Rei as a person, as another human being in the room. As someone with hopes, fears, wishes, scars, and not just an obstacle, or a robot, or a doll.  
明日香正要走进去，就在那一刻，绫波丽在男人的臂弯下看到了她。她的眼睛微微睁大，几乎像是光线的把戏，她几乎无声地摇头表示拒绝，不，不。明日香僵住了。她考虑过还是进去。毕竟，绫波丽的意见从未对她有过任何意义。但绫波丽眼中的神情：危险的谨慎，摇摇欲坠的恐惧——这使明日香停在了原地。那些微妙的表情，绫波丽下唇被咬处最微小的褶皱，是明日香能收到的最响亮的警告。这感觉对明日香来说完全不对，就像一件被破坏的艺术品，她第一次允许自己真正将绫波丽视为一个人，视为房间里的另一个有血有肉的人。视为一个有希望、恐惧、愿望、伤痕的人，而不仅仅是一个障碍，或一个机器人，或一个玩偶。

She isn't given much of a choice. In the moment that she considered all of this the man has crossed the room and he pushes the half-cracked door all the way open. When he sees Asuka the impassive expression he wears doesn't falter for a moment. But hers does - this is him, the man at the Tokyo-3 Conservatory, the judge who haunted her nightmares and laid claim to the very reason she was at this awful school. There isn't a shred of compassion, or even hatred, on his face when he gazes at her for the quickest moment. He doesn't even asks her to move and instead he walks right past her and down the hall, his frame taking up the entirety of the hallway in spirit, if not in space.  
她几乎没有选择的余地。就在她考虑这一切的瞬间，那个男人已经穿过房间，将半开的门完全推开。当他看到明日香时，他那冷漠的表情没有丝毫动摇。但她的表情却变了——这就是他，东京-3 音乐学院的那个男人，那个在她噩梦中徘徊的评委，也是她来到这所糟糕学校的根本原因。当他短暂地凝视她时，他的脸上没有一丝同情，甚至没有仇恨。他甚至没有要求她让开，而是直接从她身边走过，沿着走廊走去，他的身影在精神上占据了整个走廊，即便在空间上并非如此。

"Why was that man here? Why do you know him? What's going on, Ayanami!?"  
那个男人为什么会在这里？你怎么会认识他？到底发生了什么，绫波！？

Rei is cornered there on her bed, though her face is back to that impassive mask she so often wears. At her side Asuka's hands clench and unclench; she wants the relief of violence. She wants the release of an irrevocable action and is holding back only until she gets the answers she wants. The world feels like it's shifted on its axis. Like everything is a joke being played on her. The whole thing: being sent to this school, losing access to her dreams, the gradually worsening mistakes she's been making - it must all be connected to Rei. Rei as a fulcrum, as a lynch-pin.  
零在那里被逼到了床角，尽管她的脸又恢复了那副她常戴的无动于衷的面具。在她身旁，明日香的双手紧握又松开；她渴望暴力的解脱。她渴望一次不可逆转的行动带来的释放，只是在她得到想要的答案之前一直在克制。世界感觉像是偏离了轴心。仿佛一切都是对她开的玩笑。整个事情：被送到这所学校，失去接触梦想的机会，她逐渐加重的错误——这一切必定都与零有关。零，作为支点，作为关键。

"Why was that man here?"  
“那个男人为什么会在这里？”

"He's my father." she says quietly.  
“他是我的父亲。”她轻声说道。

Asuka slaps her hard across the cheek. It's not a conscious action. It's more like a hinge breaking, or a cord extended far past its limit snapping. Rei's head swings sideways. A red mark blooms on her cheek quickly as vibrant as a tattoo on her pale skin. Blood flowing to the surface. Physical sensations in chromatic expression.  
明日香狠狠地给了她一个耳光。这不是有意识的动作。更像是铰链断裂，或是拉得过长的绳索突然断裂。绫波的头猛地偏向一侧。她的脸颊上迅速绽放出一抹红印，鲜艳如纹身在她苍白的肌肤上。血液涌向表面。物理感受以色彩表达。

"He's your father." It's not a question.  
“他是你的父亲。”这不是一个问题。

Rei's eyes are cast to the side, her jaw taught, and Asuka seeis, clearly, the kinds of emotions hidden underneath that blank resolve. She always ignored the few signs before this, the fleeting glimpses of happiness and dismay and sorrow. She's made a mistake.  
绫波的目光偏向一侧，下巴紧绷，而明日香清晰地看到了隐藏在那空白决心之下的各种情感。她总是忽略之前的少数迹象，那些转瞬即逝的快乐、沮丧和悲伤的瞬间。她犯了一个错误。

Asuka continues. "Then what are you doing here? _Surely_ you could get into that school no matter how robotic you play if your dad's a head there."  
明日香继续说道：“那你在这里做什么？如果你的父亲是那里的负责人，无论你弹得多么机械，你肯定能进那所学校。”

"He doesn't want me." When Rei finally turns back to looking at Asuka there's something ancient etched into her face. A pain as old as she is, the geological scar of a catastrophic event that reshaped her world. The words are simple and quick, delivered with the same cadence as someone pointing out of a window describing the weather. But still they tear at the rage that has captured Asuka and dismantle it. Take it from her. She knows those words well. She said them to herself when she was old enough to understand that her own father walked away. She'd repeated them when her mother time and time again shifted between bouts of clarity and madness in more and more frequent intervals until, in the end, she went to a place where Asuka could never follow.  
"“他不要我。”当绫波丽终于转回来看着明日香时，她的脸上刻着某种古老的东西。一种与她年龄相仿的痛苦，如同地质上的疤痕，标志着一场重塑她世界的灾难性事件。这些话简单而迅速，就像某人指着窗外描述天气一样。但它们仍然撕扯着明日香的愤怒，将其拆解。从她身上夺走。她对这些话很熟悉。当她足够大，理解到自己的父亲已经离开时，她曾对自己说过这些话。当她的母亲一次又一次地在清醒与疯狂之间徘徊，间隔越来越短，直到最后，她去了一个明日香永远无法跟随的地方，她又重复了这些话。”

Rei goes on, slowly gathering herself back from cowering. Asuka can see her try to restrain herself again, to build that wall of blankness in the back of her eyes, but it's a useless gesture. She's seen behind the curtain and finds it see-through now. Clear. "My father wants me to continue with music because he has made me put so much time into it already," she says. "But more than that, it's because my mother played. I have to continue her legacy, or he will leave me behind like he did with Shinji."  
绫波继续说道，慢慢地从畏缩中恢复过来。明日香可以看到她再次试图克制自己，试图在眼底筑起那堵空白之墙，但这已是徒劳。她已经看穿了那层伪装，现在觉得它一览无余。清晰无比。‘我父亲希望我继续音乐事业，因为他已经让我投入了太多时间，’她说，‘但更重要的是，因为这是我母亲曾经演奏的。我必须继承她的遗志，否则他就会像对待真嗣那样将我抛弃。’

"_Shinji_? Shinji is - "  
“真嗣？真嗣是——”

"My brother." Rei states. "Father hasn't met with him in many years."  
“我的哥哥。”绫波陈述道，“父亲已经很多年没有见过他了。”

She was right, Asuka realizes, when she felt that her world had shifted on its axis. Everything feels like a joke. Two of the people she hates the most are related to the man who set back her plans for fame and success by uncountable years? Rei, before her, is human? Is more like her than she would pray to ever admit? It's a sick joke, and she's disgusted more than anything by her inability to escape it all. No matter the revelation, she will have to stay at this quicksand school. She will have to work harder to get to the top than ever before and now she has enemies in her very camp.  
她是对的，明日香意识到，当她感觉到自己的世界仿佛偏离了轴心。一切都变得荒谬可笑。她最讨厌的两个人竟然与那个让她的成名和成功计划倒退了无数年的人有关系？眼前的绫波，竟然是人类？比她所愿承认的更像她自己？这简直是恶心的玩笑，她对自己无法逃离这一切感到更加厌恶。无论真相如何，她都不得不留在这所如流沙般的学校。她必须比以往任何时候都更加努力才能攀登到顶峰，而现在，她的阵营中甚至有了敌人。

"This isn't funny at all." she scowls, and her voice loses all of its power. The energy leaves her as quickly as it came, and she collapses, arms spread wide, onto Rei's bed. All she has is the white ceiling above her and she hopes to make her mind blank like that for even a second.  
"这根本一点也不好笑。" 她皱着眉头说道，声音失去了所有的力量。那股能量来得快去得也快，她瘫倒在绫波的床上，双臂张开。她眼前只有那片白色的天花板，她希望自己的思绪能像那样空白哪怕一秒钟。

She feels the bed beneath her shift but does nothing about it. Rei leans forward above her, careful not to touch her, and looks down. Her face takes up almost the entirety of Asuka's view. The imprint of Asuka's hand still glows red on the girl's cheek.  
"她感觉到身下的床铺在移动，却没有任何反应。绫波俯身在她上方，小心翼翼地避免触碰她，低头看去。她的脸几乎占据了明日香视野的全部。明日香手掌留下的红印依旧在女孩的脸颊上清晰可见。

"I hate my father too, I think, if it's any consolation."  
"我也讨厌我的父亲，我想，如果这能给你任何安慰的话。"

Asuka chuckles mirthlessly. "Why don't you just quit, then? Just get out?"  
明日香无趣地笑了笑。“那你为什么不干脆辞职，然后离开呢？”

"Why don't you?" Rei answers. There's no hostility in her voice, no smirk in the words, and it hits Asuka harder because of that. She doesn't have an answer, so she laughs again.  
"那你为什么不呢？" 绫波回答道。她的声音中没有敌意，话语中也没有嘲讽，正因为如此，这话对明日香的打击更大。她没有答案，于是又笑了起来。

"Your father said something you were doing was unacceptable when I was coming in. What was it?"  
"你父亲在我进来的时候说你正在做的事情不可接受。那是什么事？"

Rei leans back against the wall. Asuka watches her stare up at the ceiling the way that Asuka herself had been. "Father is using me as a spy. He wants me to be...useful, while I'm here, and point out students he should try to bring to his school. He wants the best of the best."  
绫波靠在墙上。明日香看着她像自己之前那样凝视天花板。“父亲在利用我做间谍。他想让我在这里变得有用，指出他应该尝试招揽到他学校的学生。他想要最顶尖的学生。”

"And? What, was no one here good enough? I mean - "  
"然后呢？这里没有人足够好吗？我的意思是——"

"I only had one person on the list in the two months we've been here."  
"这两个月我们在这里，我的名单上只有一个人。"

"Who?" "谁？"

"You." "你。"

There are only so many times in a day when someone's perspective can be flipped entirely upside-down. Cognitive dissonance is like a pill with a daily limit, and side effects include headache and heartache. Asuka feels a migraine coming on now and an uneasiness in her chest.  
一天之中，人的观念彻底颠覆的次数是有限的。认知失调就像是一天只能服用一次的药丸，副作用包括头痛和心痛。明日香现在感到一阵偏头痛袭来，胸口也涌起不安。

"Oh." she gathers what little embers remain of her anger. "I don't want your pity, Ayanami."  
"哦。"她聚集起所剩无几的怒火。"我不需要你的同情，绫波。"

"It's not pity." "这不是同情。"

"You don't even like me. What else could it be? Are you trying to get me out of your hair?"  
"你甚至不喜欢我。那还能是什么？你是想摆脱我吗？"

"You're the one who doesn't like me." Rei says sharply, even with her breathy voice.  
""明明是你不喜欢我。"" 丽尖锐地说道，尽管她的声音有些喘息。

Asuka can't answer that. It's true - she's almost subsisted off of her hatred of Rei for the past two months in order to get through each and every day in a school she never even wanted to look at, let alone be a part of. But it suddenly feels like that won't be a viable option any more. In the span of a conversation all of her previous feelings about Rei have morphed into a form unsuitable to the same hatred. Rei is like a mirror, or the silvery surface of a quiet lake, and it has become quickly apparent that Asuka can't hate what she's seen behind the mask - the roiling emotions barely held back, the caldera of feelings contained so strictly, and loosened in quick jets, it seems, at odd moments. As much as Asuka would like to call their differences into attention, she knows that her own outward professionalism, her own quick-to-anger triggers are there, mostly, to hide her true feelings. And, worse still, she knows that Rei knows that. It would've been obvious for months, had she let herself see it. It makes her hate Rei in a different way. It makes her hate Rei like she hates herself.  
明日香无法回答这个问题。的确，过去两个月里，她几乎全靠对绫波的憎恨支撑着，才得以度过在那个她连看都不愿看一眼的学校中的每一天，更别提融入其中了。然而，突然间，她觉得这不再是一个可行的选择。仅仅在一次对话的时间里，她对绫波的所有先前感受都发生了变化，变得不再适合那种憎恨。绫波就像一面镜子，或是一片宁静湖泊的银色表面，很快便显露出，明日香无法憎恨她所窥见的面具背后的真实——那些汹涌的情感勉强被压抑着，那些被严格控制的情感火山口，在奇怪的时刻以急促的喷发释放。尽管明日香很想强调她们之间的差异，但她清楚，自己表面的专业态度，以及易怒的触发点，大多是为了隐藏真实的情感。更糟糕的是，她知道绫波也知道这一点。如果她允许自己看清，这本应是几个月前就显而易见的事实。这让她以一种不同的方式憎恨绫波。这让她像憎恨自己一样憎恨绫波。

So she stays silent. If she listens closely she can hear other students coming back into the dorms. Life far outside of herself. The stale smell in the room, almost mildew-y, that has not gone away, is washed out here beside Rei. Whatever the scent was she had caught from the blanket on that cold morning, she smells it here more strongly. Asuka curls onto her side. Her back is turned to Rei, but she can feel the attention the girl is giving her even though those bright red eyes are cast against the ceiling, counting invisible constellations.  
于是她保持沉默。如果她仔细聆听，能听到其他学生回到宿舍的声音。那是远离她自己的生活。房间里那股陈腐的、几乎发霉的气味并未消散，但在雷伊身边却似乎被冲淡了。无论那天寒冷早晨从毯子上捕捉到的气味是什么，此刻她在这里闻得更强烈了。明日香蜷缩成一团，背对着雷伊，却能感觉到女孩投来的关注，尽管那双明亮的红眼睛正对着天花板，数着看不见的星座。

A memory blankets Asuka's mind. She sees herself in Germany. Trees so green they look fake shuffle past her window on a slow countryside train. She's alone in the train car because her mother was with a doctor. Again. Asuka couldn't stay in that room with her. The smell of death seemed to permeate from her mother's pores, sickly and cold like the grave, blending with the arid, sanitized air coming from the hospital itself. She didn't even tell her mother she was leaving. Her mother wouldn't have been aware enough to care regardless, and though she had her own money, Asuka swipes train fare from her mother's purse. She purchased a round trip ticket to some town on the edge of the North Sea. All she wanted to see were the waves devouring the sand. She wanted to see destruction. She wanted to be dragged out to sea. Her mother ruined it all again - her one bright night, her one big show, and then, of course, mommy had to snap. She recalls the trees again. Hemmed in on each side. Just the claustrophobic trees, when she wants the oblivion of the open sea.  
记忆如毯子般覆盖了明日香的思绪。她看见自己在德国，一列缓缓穿行于乡间的火车窗外，树木绿得仿佛不真实，一一掠过。她独自坐在车厢里，因为母亲正与医生在一起，又一次。明日香无法在那房间里停留，死亡的气息似乎从母亲的毛孔中渗出，病态而冰冷，如同坟墓，与医院干燥消毒的空气交织。她甚至没有告诉母亲自己要离开，母亲也未必有意识去在意，尽管她有自己的钱，明日香还是从母亲的包里偷拿了火车费。她买了一张往返票，前往北海边的一个小镇。她只想看海浪吞噬沙滩，渴望目睹毁灭，渴望被拖入大海。母亲又一次毁了一切——她唯一的明亮夜晚，她唯一的大秀，然后，当然，妈妈又崩溃了。她再次回想起那些树，两侧紧逼，只有令人窒息的树木，而她渴望的是开阔海域的无尽虚空。

Asuka closes her eyes hard enough to see bright spots in her vision. When she opens them again Rei is looking down at their joined hands. Her hand is cool and soft, her fingers long since calloused. Asuka closes her eyes again and swears she can feel Rei's heartbeat through her skin.  
明日香用力闭上眼睛，以至于眼前出现了亮斑。当她再次睁开眼时，丽正低头看着她们紧握的手。丽的手凉凉的，柔软而指尖早已磨出茧子。明日香再次闭上眼睛，发誓能感觉到丽皮肤下跳动的心跳。

Asuka doesn't pull away, and neither does Rei. She lays there and gathers her strength until the sun sets.  
明日香没有抽回手，丽也没有。她就那样躺着，积蓄力量，直到太阳落山。

---

"I wasn't going to show anyone this place," Asuka begins, "but whatever, I guess you can know too."  
“我本来不打算让任何人知道这个地方，”明日香开始说，“但算了，我想你也可以知道。”

The crisp scent of autumn air rushes by with the wind that rustles skirts and hair, revealing the bright white of Rei's thighs to Asuka, who looks away with an apple blush. If Rei notices the reason for the sudden twist of Asuka's face, she says nothing. After looking around for any potential witnesses, Asuka pulls open the double doors of her practice theater. She'd been using the place for nearly a month, but dust and musk hadn't gone away yet. They have, in fact, built up over the time she's used the room - mold or mildew growing in secret behind the plaster walls or beneath the rug, dust stratifying on the chairs and steps in different geological definitions. The single cone of light in the center of the stage is almost solid in the dimness of the rest of the wide, empty room. Darkness multiplies distance, echoes the lack of light like a cave does sound. That the auditorium is cold, colder even than outside of it, is its only major flaw.  
秋日清新的气息随风疾驰，吹动裙摆与发丝，让绫波丽雪白的大腿暴露在明日香眼前，后者脸颊泛起苹果般的红晕，急忙移开视线。如果绫波注意到明日香突然扭曲的表情背后的原因，她也未曾言明。环顾四周确认无旁观者后，明日香推开了练习剧场的大门。她已使用这里近一个月，但尘埃与霉味仍未散去。事实上，随着时间的推移，这些痕迹反而愈发累积——霉菌或霉斑在石膏墙后或地毯下悄然生长，灰尘在椅子和台阶上形成了不同地质层。舞台中央的唯一一束光在空旷昏暗的房间中几乎显得实体化。黑暗放大了距离，如同洞穴中的回声般呼应着光线的缺失。剧院内异常寒冷，甚至比外面还要冷，这是它唯一的重大缺陷。

"Is this where you've been practicing?" Rei asks. She sneezes a puppy sneeze, short and quick, and sniffles.  
“你一直在这里练习吗？”绫波问道。她打了个小狗般的喷嚏，短促而迅速，随后吸了吸鼻子。

"Got a problem with it?"  
“有什么问题吗？”

"I have been curious." "我一直很好奇。"

"Where do you practice? Do you practice?"  
"你在哪里练习？你练习吗？"

"In the room, when you're gone."  
"在你离开后的房间里。"

They stand on the stage side by side, silent, the light bright and growing uncomfortably warm quickly. Asuka hefts her violin case over her shoulder and clears her throat.  
他们并肩站在舞台上，沉默不语，灯光明亮且迅速变得令人不适地温暖。明日香将她的提琴盒扛在肩上，清了清嗓子。

"I'm going up there to practice," she motions with her chin to the platform and catwalks, "you do it down here. Should work."  
“我要上去练习，”她下巴朝向平台和走道示意，“你在这里练。应该行得通。”

"Asuka, why did you bring me here?" Rei asks. She looks right into Asuka's eyes. She always has - there isn't a shred of embarrassment in the girl: not embarrassment, not shame, not hesitancy. She hides nothing that she doesn't refrain from saying, and that frankness disarms Asuka. That openness of truth pushes her off kilter like a child rolling too fast down a hill. Asuka herself doesn't know why she did, why she felt this disgusting relatedness to the girl after the scene with her father. After the blanket out in the cold. After her things were picked up and her pride was reignited. It just feels right, and a right feeling has been missing from her life for far too long. She almost forgot that things didn't always have to feel wrong.  
“明日香，你为什么带我来这里？”绫波问道。她直视着明日香的眼睛。她总是这样——这个女孩没有一丝羞涩：没有羞涩，没有耻辱，没有犹豫。她隐藏的只是她选择不说出口的，这种坦率让明日香感到措手不及。这种真实的开放感让她像一个在山坡上滚得太快的孩子一样失去平衡。明日香自己也不知道为什么她会这么做，为什么在和她父亲的那场戏之后，她对这个女孩感到一种令人作呕的亲近感。在寒冷中被毯子包裹之后。在她收拾好东西，自尊心重新燃起之后。这感觉就是对的，而这种正确的感觉在她生活中已经缺失太久了。她几乎忘记了，事情并不总是感觉不对。

"Go, if you don't want to be here."  
"走吧，如果你不想待在这里。"

"I didn't say that." "我没那么说。"

"So get to practicing. I'm not going to look stupid on that stage when we finally have to put on a show, and I won't have you dragging me down either."  
"所以赶紧练习。我们最终上台表演时，我可不想显得愚蠢，也不允许你拖我后腿。"

There's a beat, and then one of those rare, fleeting birds - Rei's smile - skitters across her face. "Okay, I understand." she says. Then, "Good luck."  
片刻的沉默后，一只罕见的、转瞬即逝的鸟儿——绫波的微笑——掠过她的脸庞。“好的，我明白了。”她说道。接着，“祝你好运。”

"Don't make me sick. I don't rely on luck at all."  
“别让我恶心。我从不依赖运气。”

Rei finds a folding chair somewhere off stage and sits sits right beneath the spotlight. Asuka watches her pull out her sheet music and begin studying it with the single-minded focus she gives whenever her mind isn't floating in some groundless otherworld. Rei, as always, appears to be otherworldly, and beneath the halo of golden light looks again like she may just flash quietly or shuffle out of existence, exit stage left.  
绫波在舞台边找到一把折叠椅，坐在聚光灯下。明日香看着她拿出乐谱，开始全神贯注地研究起来，每当她的思绪没有飘向某个虚无缥缈的异世界时，她总是如此专注。绫波一如既往地显得超凡脱俗，在金色光环的映衬下，她仿佛随时都会悄然闪烁或悄然消失，从舞台左侧退场。

With a flick of shame Asuka catches herself staring. It's almost unbelievable. She doesn't want to believe it, anyway, and heads finally for the ladder. She ambles up it, clutching the violin case in one hand, everything set now to the opening strokes of Rei's bow against the strings. The stretch from the catwalk to her practicing platform looks longer than usual. And while fear of falling never even enters her mind, she is gradually - with each step, with every shuffle - filled with a squirming anxiety. Squishy, slick, it escapes her grasp and wriggles harder in her lungs, through the booming chambers of her heart until all she can hear in her head is the blood pumping there harder harder, the force of a river beating against a dam.  
带着一丝羞愧，明日香意识到自己在盯着看。这几乎令人难以置信。无论如何，她不想相信这一点，于是终于走向梯子。她悠闲地爬上去，一手紧握着小提琴盒，一切准备就绪，只待绫波的弓触碰琴弦的开始。从走道到她的练习平台，这段距离看起来比平常更长。尽管她从未担心过坠落，但随着每一步，每一次挪动，她逐渐被一种蠕动的焦虑填满。这种焦虑湿滑而黏腻，从她的掌控中溜走，在她的肺部、在她心脏的轰鸣腔室中更加剧烈地扭动，直到她脑海中只剩下血液在那里更加剧烈地泵动，如同河水猛烈撞击堤坝的力量。

It's just Rei down there, she tries to reason. Who cares if she messes up?  
下面只是绫波而已，她试图说服自己。就算搞砸了又怎样？

But it's just that. The mistakes have piled up, and now it is not longer a question of if, but when she will mess up. The line has been crossed already from perfect prodigy and inches further into the territory of normal. The illusion, it's mirror-like shattering, glints in the back of her eyes. Her hands shake. She doesn't take a seat. She hopes to be like a rock in a river, diverting the stream of music that comes from some places above her or inside of her, given or formed, into the reservoir she chooses. To change the current, to force it away from mistakes and towards a briny estuary of skill and fame and advancement. She runs the bow against the strings, testing the waters so to speak, holding a wet finger up to the sky to feel the direction of the breeze like she did as a child before blowing wishing flowers and watching her one desire - to be perfect like her mother - fracture and break into dozens of little wishes and fly off into the future she could already imagine.  
但事实就是如此。错误堆积如山，如今已不再是她是否会出错的问题，而是何时会出错。那条从完美神童到普通人的界限已然跨越，正一步步深入平凡的领域。幻象如镜面般破碎，在她眼底闪烁。她的手在颤抖，没有坐下。她希望自己能像河中的岩石，引导来自上方或内心某处的音乐之流——无论是天赋还是塑造——汇入她选择的蓄水池。改变流向，迫使它远离错误，朝着技艺、名声与进步。她用弓轻触琴弦，试探着水深，就像儿时举起湿润的手指感受风向，然后吹散许愿花，看着唯一的愿望——像母亲一样完美——碎裂成无数小愿望，飞向她已能预见的未来。

Later, when she climbs back down the ladder bristling with fury, breathing hard, she repeats the tally in her head: three missed notes, four bars at the wrong tempo, a slip of the wrist, a cough. Rei stands beneath the light and waits for Asuka to reach her, but Asuka silently walks past with little but a hand wave behind her.  
稍后，当她怒气冲冲地从梯子上爬下来，呼吸急促时，她在脑海中重复着失误的次数：三个错过的音符，四个小节错误的节奏，手腕一滑，一声咳嗽。丽站在灯光下等待明日香下来，但明日香只是默默地从她身边走过，几乎没有回头挥手。

"I think you did well today," Rei says She catches up, but falls in step behind Asuka.  
“我觉得你今天表现得很好，”丽说。她追了上来，但跟在明日香后面一步。

Asuka's breath hitches. She keeps walking. She doesn't say a word as they wander in the cloudy dusk to their dorm room.  
明日香的呼吸一滞。她继续走着。在阴沉的黄昏中，她们漫步回宿舍，她一句话也没说。

**Part 8 第 8 部分**

It is two weeks after their previous paradigm shattered. Asuka taps her foot on the ground waiting for Rei to catch up after she marched across campus to the cluttered group practice room. Her breath clouds into the cold air and joins the blanket of gray above her. Rei reaches her and wordlessly, and together, they continue on. It's strange now to look at Shinji when they enter the room and see the features he shares with Rei, presumably from their mother. It's entirely obvious now that she looks with the knowledge of the fact. They have the same wide eyes, full of innocence and a kind of childish grace. The same soft cheeks, the same textured hair and long, thin fingers. Asuka takes her seat at the first chair to the left of their semi-circle. She hands Rei her violin, as she had taken both when they left their dorm. Kaworu smirks like knew this friendship would happen all along, and not for the first time Asuka wants to make him eat her fist. So what - she has a friend now. It can't be all that unexpected. When he turns away from her he is back to playing with Shinji's fingers on the hand that isn't being held. But then she feels his eyes on her again. She narrows her own.  
距离他们之前的模式崩溃已经过去了两周。明日香用脚尖敲打着地面，等待着绫波丽追上来，她刚才大步穿过校园，来到了杂乱的集体练习室。她的呼吸在寒冷的空气中凝成雾气，融入了头顶的灰色天幕。绫波丽赶上她，两人默默地继续前行。现在看着真嗣进入房间，注意到他与绫波丽共享的特征，据说是来自他们的母亲，这感觉很奇怪。现在有了这个认知，一切变得显而易见。他们有着同样宽大的眼睛，充满了纯真和一种孩童般的优雅。同样的柔和脸颊，同样的质感头发和修长纤细的手指。明日香坐在半圆形排列的第一把椅子上。她把小提琴递给绫波丽，因为离开宿舍时她拿了两人的乐器。渚薰带着一种早就预料到这种友谊会发生的微笑，这让明日香不止一次想要让他尝尝她的拳头。那又怎样——她现在有了一个朋友。这并不那么出人意料。当他转过身去，又开始玩弄真嗣那只未被握住的手指时，她感到他的目光再次落在她身上。她眯起了自己的眼睛。

"What?" "什么？"

"I think you'll find it interesting that I was accepted into the Tokyo-3 conservatory."  
"我觉得你可能会感兴趣，我被东京-3 音乐学院录取了。"

Asuka curls her hands into fists. She tries burning Kaworu head off with her stare. "Why should I care?"  
明日香双手紧握成拳，试图用目光将薰的头烧掉。“我为什么要关心这个？”

"You shouldn't. But I know that you yourself attempted to get in, no? Isn't that why you're always so angry?"  
"你确实不必。但我知道你也尝试过申请，不是吗？这就是你总是那么生气的原因吧？"

"I'm angry because I'm surrounded by useless idiots like you." She sees Rei staring at her, waiting to see if she explodes, with a hand outstretched to offer care or comfort. She takes a breath. "Why aren't you there, then?"  
"我很生气，因为我周围都是像你这样的无用蠢货。" 她看到零正盯着她，等着看她是否会爆发，一只手伸出来，似乎要给予关怀或安慰。她深吸了一口气。"那你为什么不在那里呢？"

"They turned me away at the door." he shrugs, but the smirk he often wears is gone. Vanished. "Turns out, they keep the right to take back any acceptance they want. I hadn't even walked in before they told me they found someone better."  
"他们在门口就把我拒之门外了。" 他耸了耸肩，但那常挂在他脸上的坏笑不见了，消失了。"结果发现，他们有权随时撤回任何录取决定。我还没踏进门，他们就告诉我找到了更合适的人选。"

"Are you implying the same could've happened to me? Because let me tell you - "  
"你是在暗示同样的事情也可能发生在我身上吗？因为让我告诉你——"

"I'm simply trying to tell you that maybe being here was supposed to happen in the first place. For you, for me, for Rei. For dear Shinji here. And that perhaps we all ought to take this in stride."  
"我只是在试图告诉你，也许一开始我们就注定要在这里。为了你，为了我，为了丽。还有我们亲爱的真嗣。或许我们都应该从容接受这一切。"

"My destiny is to show the world just how good I am."  
"我的命运就是向世界展示我有多么出色。"

Kaworu smiles more softly than she has ever seen him smile before. "Those two things aren't mutually exclusive."  
薰的微笑比她以往见过的任何时候都要温柔。“这两件事并不相互排斥。”

The bell ring. A good enough sign as any for her to quit the conversation, She runs amber rosin up and down the length of the horse-hair bow. A seat away, Rei tests the tuning of her own strings. She has reattached her mask. What tell-tale signs of humanity she'd shown Asuka are locked in their dorm room and held tight behind the door; in the outside world she hasn't changed at all. But Asuka knows what to look for. A quiver of her eyes, a hitch in her voice, the tensing of a muscle in her alabaster neck. It's hard to say that she likes Rei. That there's something interesting - fascinating, even - about the girl. But it's harder to lie to herself, or at least to add that lie on top of all of the others Asuka has to balance. Lies like: she is happy to compete here; she is confident in her abilities; she is better than everyone.  
铃声响起，对她而言，这足以成为结束对话的信号。她用琥珀色的松香来回涂抹着马尾弓。相隔一个座位，绫波正在调试自己的琴弦，重新戴上了面具。她曾在明日香面前流露的人性痕迹，如今已被锁在宿舍内，紧闭于门后；在外界，她丝毫未变。然而，明日香知道该寻找什么：眼神的一丝颤动，声音的瞬间停顿，苍白颈项上肌肉的微紧。很难说是否喜欢绫波，是否觉得这女孩有某种引人入胜——甚至令人着迷之处。但更难的是欺骗自己，至少在已有的众多谎言之上再添一层。那些谎言包括：她乐于在此竞技；她对自己的能力充满信心；她胜过所有人。

Kaji enters through the door and is followed by a cloud of some perfume, a cloyingly sweet smell that obviously belongs to a woman and has obviously rubbed off on him after some back room tryst. Asuka rolls her eyes. His stubble is the same size it always is, and she knows she's correct in assuming that it's a look he deliberately develops. He quiets the room with by clearing his voice obviously and loudly.  
卡吉穿过门进来，身后跟着一团香水味，那是一种甜得发腻的香气，明显属于某个女人，显然是在某个密室幽会后沾染在他身上的。明日香翻了个白眼。他的胡茬还是老样子，她知道自己的猜测没错，这是他故意留出的造型。他故意大声清了清嗓子，让房间安静下来。

"Before we begin practicing, I want to formally announce the piece you four will be playing next month in your first student expo."  
在开始练习之前，我想正式宣布你们四人下个月在首次学生博览会上将要演奏的作品。

A twinge of discomfort flashes beneath Asuka's skin before she wills it away. To her left , Shinji doesn't even try to hide his nervous grimace. Rei's gaze flickers over to her for a quick second. Nonjudgmental. Maybe concerned. Kaji paces slowly from the left to the right and pauses with his hands in his pockets when he stops. Slouching like he's still a college student. Asuka rolls her eyes again.  
一丝不适在明日香的皮肤下闪过，随即被她强压下去。在她左边，真嗣甚至没有试图掩饰他紧张的苦笑。绫波的目光快速地向她瞥了一眼，没有评判，或许有些关切。卡吉慢慢地从左到右踱步，停下来时双手插兜，懒散地站着，仿佛还是个大学生。明日香再次翻了个白眼。

"For what it's worth," Kaji says, almost hiding a smile. "I took a look at what each and every one of your weaknesses are, and I've decided that you'll be playing Brahms' _Piano Quartet No.1 in G minor_. It will be hard. I've chosen it to be hard. But maybe it'll all work out."  
"不管怎样，" 薰说，几乎掩藏不住一丝微笑。"我仔细研究了你们每个人的弱点，决定让你们演奏勃拉姆斯的《G 小调第一钢琴四重奏》。这会很难。我特意选了难的。但或许一切都会顺利的。

He hands out the sheet music to each member of the chamber group and then plays the piece once out of the dusty old radio in the back of the room. Asuka follows along with her eyes, already upset as she listens to the awful rendition coming from the speaker. She can hear it, the places where she will need the utmost control - on those quick jumps and manic strings, where even a touch more emotion than already necessary would unbalance the piece like there's too much weight on a scale. It's clear to her too just how easy it would be for the rest of the chamber group to sink the thing, to completely decimate the piece and its movements. Begrudgingly, she has to praise Kaji for the choice. There are few better ways to test their resolve or their improvements - or lack there of. A great choice, actually.  
他将乐谱分发给室内乐团的每位成员，然后从房间后部那台积满灰尘的老旧收音机里播放了一次这首曲子。明日香随着旋律用目光跟随着，听着扬声器传出的糟糕演绎，她已经感到不悦。她能听出来，那些需要极致控制的地方——在那些快速的跳跃和狂热的弦乐中，哪怕再多一丝情感，都可能像天平上过重的砝码一样让整个曲子失衡。她也清楚地意识到，室内乐团的其他人很容易就能毁掉这首曲子，彻底破坏它的乐章。尽管不情愿，她不得不佩服薰的选择。这确实是考验他们决心或进步的绝佳方式——或者说是缺乏进步的检验。实际上，这是个极好的选择。

Not that she'd actually tell him that.  
当然，她绝不会真的告诉他这一点。

"In better news," he smirks. "We're going on a trip this weekend. I've already cleared it with those stuffy higher ups. Think of it as a...bonding experience."  
"好消息是，"他坏笑着说，"这个周末我们要去旅行。我已经和那些一本正经的上司们打过招呼了。就当是一次...增进感情的经历吧。"

---

Asuka isn't sure how he's done it, but Kaji rented out a hotel's pool for a few hours. The hotel sits on the edge of a beach that stretches miles across. Gray sand, gray water, gray sky. It's the off season, and the whole place is arid with emptiness as they carry their instruments into the pool room through hallways without even a hint of life. The humidity in here is sticky and uncomfortable. The air is colored with the chlorine. She tastes it in the back of her throat every time she breathes, stinging nettles and bleach. Lights under the water grant the otherwise washed out room the phantasmagorian glow of bright sea-glass.  
明日香不确定他是怎么做到的，但加持已经租下了酒店的泳池几个小时。这家酒店坐落在一片绵延数英里的海滩边缘。灰色的沙，灰色的水，灰色的天空。现在是淡季，整个地方因为空旷而显得干枯，他们带着乐器穿过没有一丝生气的走廊进入泳池室。这里的湿度黏腻而不适。空气中弥漫着氯的味道。每当她呼吸时，都能在喉咙后部尝到那种刺痛的荨麻和漂白剂的味道。水下的灯光为这个原本单调的房间赋予了明亮海玻璃般的幻影般的光辉。

He asks them to play the Brahms' piece they'd studded for the past week. Something about the quality of the acoustics of the room - the echo off the water slick walls that return sounds doubled and tripled over itself, sound waves amplified by the high ceilings. He wants them to hear the music they make thrown back at them, to hear their mistakes and mishaps, their speed and technique over and over again. It feels like torture.  
他要求他们演奏过去一周里刻苦练习的勃拉姆斯作品。房间的音响效果有些特别——水滑的墙壁反射出的回声，使得声音在自身上叠加、翻倍，声波因高耸的天花板而放大。他希望他们能听到自己创作的音乐被反弹回来，听到自己的错误和失误，速度与技巧一遍又一遍地回响。这感觉就像是一种折磨。

Asuka's sick. She feels it in her blood, and this nauseas room radiates toxicity from the walls themselves. She feels it in her fingers, which slip from string to string slick with her sweat and discordant - screeching, when the bow scratches out the wrong notes time after time. Her heart beats in her ears louder even than the dizzying echo assaulting her ears.  
明日香生病了。她能感觉到血液中的不适，而这间令人作呕的房间从墙壁本身散发着毒性。她感觉到手指在弦与弦之间滑脱，汗水使它们变得湿滑而不和谐——当弓一次次划出错误的音符时，发出刺耳的尖叫。她的心跳在耳边砰砰作响，甚至比那令人眩晕的回声还要响亮。

She hears herself scream, but doesn't feel it folding out of her throat.  
她听见自己尖叫，却感觉不到声音从喉咙中涌出。

"Asuka - " Rei whispers. She stopped playing. Everyone has, and they stare at Asuka.  
"明日香——" 绫波低声说道。她停止了演奏。所有人都停下了，他们盯着明日香。

She hadn't heard her own scream, but underneath it - a current, like the undertow, Rei's voice cut through the remains of her outburst; quiet, bodiless words that appeared in her head instantly, bypassing all of the useless apparatus in her ears.  
她并未听见自己的尖叫，但在其之下——一股暗流，如同海底的潜流，绫波的声音穿透了她爆发后的余波；轻柔、无实体的话语瞬间出现在她脑海中，绕过了她耳朵里所有无用的器官。

"Asuka - " Rei repeats, "What is it?"  
"明日香——" 绫波重复道，"怎么了？"

She almost flings her violin to the ground, but stops herself at the last seconds. They, the quartet and Kaji, are alone in the pool room but she feels watched by the world as if the walls themselves have eyes. Blank, white eyes, blinking at once open, close, watching her.  
她几乎要将小提琴摔在地上，却在最后一刻克制住了自己。四重奏的成员和加持都在泳池室里，但她感觉全世界都在注视着她，仿佛墙壁本身也长着眼睛。空洞的白色眼睛，一瞬间睁开，闭合，注视着她。

What is it?, Rei asked. In some working section of her mind, Asuka tries to form complete thoughts by squeezing disparate syllables together in her head, like trying to build a wall without stone and brick and mortar. She watches from that same working part of her mind when Shinji lifts a weak hand to help in a disgusting display of spinelessness. He never leaves his seat.  
怎么了？绫波问道。在脑海中某个运转的部分，明日香试图将零散的音节在脑中挤压在一起，形成完整的思绪，就像试图在没有石头、砖块和砂浆的情况下筑墙。她从那个同样运转的部分观察到，真嗣无力地举起一只手试图帮忙，那是一种令人作呕的软弱表现。他始终没有离开座位。

"This entire thing is ridiculous. Stupid. I don't need some gimmick to know how I'm doing!" She places her things neatly on the chair she'd been sitting on and, trailing what little remained of her pride behind her, walks out of the pool room before saying something to Kaji that she can't take back.  
"这整件事太荒谬了，愚蠢至极。我不需要什么噱头来了解自己的表现！"她将自己的物品整齐地放在之前坐过的椅子上，带着所剩无几的自尊，走出了泳池室，以免对加持说出无法收回的话。

Night has fallen in the hours since she left. Waves crash against the shore and a storm lights up the night sky and she can't tell how far away it is. Distance disappears in the endless, expansive ocean before her. Nothing has a position in the lengthening of forever. Her face burns with an emotion between embarrassment and shame. She rubs at tear trails on her cheeks that she insists to herself are just the result of the ocean breeze. Either way she tastes the stinging salt on her tongue.  
自她离去后，夜幕已然降临。海浪拍打着岸边，一场风暴点亮了夜空，她无法判断风暴距离自己有多远。在眼前这无垠的海洋中，距离感消失了。在永恒的延伸中，万物都失去了位置。她的脸颊因夹杂着尴尬与羞愧的情绪而灼热。她擦拭着脸颊上的泪痕，坚称那只是海风所致。无论如何，她都能尝到舌尖上刺痛的咸味。

She doesn't hear Rei approach her over the roaring of the waves. Rei is always quiet - her element is air: dry and wispy, soundless, her footsteps never really touching the ground, her voice impossible to picture as color. It's the same now as a storm approaches and strikes the rolling ocean with lightning. Asuka wishes she were like that lightening. Bright. Brilliant. Dangerous. Captivating.  
她没有听到丽在海浪的咆哮声中走近。丽总是悄无声息——她的元素是空气：干燥而飘渺，无声无息，她的脚步仿佛从未真正触及地面，她的声音难以想象成颜色。现在，当风暴逼近，用闪电击打着翻滚的海洋时，也是如此。明日香希望自己能像那闪电一样。明亮。耀眼。危险。迷人。

"Do you feel better now?" Rei asks. Not, why, not where have you been, not how could you. There is no judgment in her voice, not even now as Asuka's learned to listen beneath it, to find the buried emotion that's carried by everything the girl says. Her lungs squirm. The kindness hurts.  
“你现在感觉好些了吗？”丽问道。没有问为什么，没有问你去哪儿了，没有问你怎么能这样。她的声音中没有丝毫的评判，即使现在明日香已经学会在她的声音之下倾听，去寻找女孩所说的一切中携带的隐含情感。她的肺部感到一阵紧缩。这份善意令人痛苦。

"What are you even doing out here?"  
"你在这里到底做什么？"

"It's raining." "下雨了。"

"Tell me something I don't know."  
"告诉我一些我不知道的事。"

"You should come in soon. You don't want to get sick."  
"你该快点进来了。你不想生病吧。"

"I'm the only one who knows what I want."  
"只有我才知道自己想要什么。"

"What _do_ you want, Asuka?"  
"你想要什么，明日香？"

She won't answer. She can't answer, not really. It's both obvious and everyday somehow further from possibility. "What do _you_ want, Rei? I never asked you to care about what I was doing. I never asked you to care about me."  
她不会回答的。她无法真正回答，这既显而易见又日常，却愈发远离了可能性。“你到底想要什么，绫波？我从没要求你关心我在做什么。我从没要求你关心我。”

"You didn't have to. You have no one else to do that."  
“你不必说出口。你无人可依。”

"What's it to you!?" Asuka flings herself at Rei. She grabs the collar of the girl's coat in her hand ready to ring her throat. Rei's stare seems to look right through Asuka, through to her core, and it hurts to have anyone or anything that close.  
"“这关你什么事！？”明日香猛地扑向绫波。她抓住女孩外套的领子，准备勒紧她的喉咙。绫波的目光仿佛能看穿明日香，直抵她的内心，这种被任何人或事物如此接近的感觉令人痛苦。”

"Your hands are cold. Why don't we go in?"  
"你的手好冷。我们进去吧？"

Rei's eyes are soft and calm and deathless in relation to the rushing ocean behind her. They are the red of shattered rubies; they slice and cut. She looks away. Drops the girl down onto the sand.  
零的眼眸柔和而平静，与她身后汹涌的海洋形成鲜明对比。它们是破碎红宝石的颜色；锋利而尖锐。她转过头去，将女孩轻轻放在沙滩上。

She tastes again the stinging salt on her tongue.  
她再次尝到了舌尖上刺痛的咸味。

The hotel room smells like every other, an identity-less non-fragrance, the hint of freshness beneath heavy cloth. The same smell coming off of the blankets and the pillowcases, the thick curtains, the boringly patterned rug, the fake wood grain, the air conditioner. She thought the hotel might be nicer - from the outside there's something a bit more grand being promised in all of the gloss and shine, but this is boring, this is like some roadside motel. Nothing at all like the villa she'd stayed in in Germany. She closes the curtains in front of the only windows in the room to block out the flashes of lightning that still crack above the sea.  
酒店房间的气味与其他房间如出一辙，一种无个性的非香气，厚重布料下隐约透出的清新。同样的气味从毯子、枕套、厚重的窗帘、图案单调的地毯、仿木纹理、空调中散发出来。她原以为酒店会更高级——从外观上看，那些光泽与闪耀似乎承诺着某种更为宏伟的东西，但这里却平淡无奇，就像某个路边的汽车旅馆。与她在德国住过的别墅截然不同。她拉上房间唯一窗户前的窗帘，以遮挡海面上空依旧划过的闪电。

She sits on the edge of the single bed in the room gazing at the blank tv, an old tube machine in a cheap furniture store stand. It wasn't knowledge she actually had, but if Kaji was paying for the place, she imagines it might've been cheaper for him not to buy a room for the girls with two beds. Asuka considers stealing the blanket off of the mattress and sleeping on the floor, but there's a weakness radiating through her body that can be solved only through immediate sleep. Wearing little more than a thin camisole and a pair of panties, the cold air wraps around her shoulder and raises goosebumps. The bed beneath her exposed thighs is itchy. A thought passes through her head, unimpeded and disconnected from the rest, about whether it is okay that she is in her most boring and practical under-things, and if Rei would care about their lack of appeal.  
她坐在房间里那张单人床的边缘，凝视着空白的电视屏幕，那是一台旧式的显像管电视，放在廉价家具店的架子上。这并非她确切知道的事实，但如果这个地方是加持付的钱，她猜想对他来说，不买双床房给女孩们住可能会更便宜。明日香考虑过把床垫上的毯子偷走，睡在地上，但身体里弥漫着一种只能通过立即入睡才能缓解的虚弱感。她只穿着一件薄薄的紧身背心和一条内裤，冷风环绕着她的肩膀，激起一片鸡皮疙瘩。她裸露的大腿下，床铺刺痒难耐。一个念头不受阻碍地闪过她的脑海，与其它思绪无关，她在想自己穿着最乏味实用的内衣是否合适，以及绫波是否会介意它们的缺乏吸引力。

She buries the thought beneath a static of mindlessness.  
她将这个念头埋藏在一片无意识的静电噪音之下。

It's then that Rei emerges from the bathroom just as undressed; she's thin enough that Asuka can count the outline of her ribs. She rubs her hair carelessly with a towel, wiping the rain and salt wind from her wispy locks. Asuka's own damp hair sticks to the back of her neck.  
就在这时，绫波从浴室里走了出来，同样衣衫不整；她瘦得明日香都能数出她肋骨的轮廓。她漫不经心地用毛巾擦着头发，将雨水和咸湿的海风从她那细软的发丝中抹去。明日香自己的湿发则贴在了她的后颈上。

Rei stands in front of her before she even notices. "Here, your hair's wet too."  
零站在她面前，她甚至还没察觉。“看，你的头发也湿了。”

"Stop, stop, I can do it." Asuka snatches the towel when Rei leans in to wrap it around her head. She doesn't want to be pitied so much, to have all of this attention ladled on her. It all just runs through and dries out, the way rain falls through desert crags and into the heart of the ground without nurturing a thing - disappearing as quickly as it hits the dirt. Rei's expression doesn't change, though her eyes linger for longer than they should before she walks over to the edge of the room and flicks the lights off. Everything then is black, and the black of the night itself sucks even the minute brilliance of the alarm clock's red numbers away until they look flat, two dimensional, the vitality draining as the seconds tick by.  
“停，停，我自己来。”当零倾身想要用毛巾裹住她的头时，明日香一把夺过毛巾。她不想被如此怜悯，不想承受这么多关注。这一切就像雨水落入沙漠的岩缝，直抵地心却未滋养任何事物——一触即逝。零的表情未变，但她的目光停留得比应有的时间更长，随后她走到房间边缘，关掉了灯。一切顿时陷入黑暗，夜色本身吞噬了闹钟上红色数字的微弱光芒，直到它们显得扁平，二维化，随着秒针的滴答声，生机逐渐流失。

"Your violin is in the closet." Rei answers the question that Asuka hadn't yet asked.  
“你的小提琴在柜子里。”零回答了明日香尚未提出的问题。

The space across from her on the mattress sinks, but just barely. Rei is light, frail and light, and nearly weightless. It's like she doesn't exist, not really, not in any physical way outside of Asuka's head. At this point she would hardly be surprised if that were the case, if she were making this whole thing up.  
床垫对面她的位置微微下沉，但几乎察觉不到。绫波很轻，虚弱而轻盈，几乎感觉不到重量。她仿佛不存在，真的不存在，除了在明日香脑海中，她没有任何实体存在感。到了这个地步，如果这一切都是她想象出来的，她也不会感到惊讶。

She doesn't want to consider what it would say about her if she hated her own imaginary friend.  
她不愿去想，如果她讨厌自己的想象中的朋友，那会说明她自己有什么问题。

"What did Kaji say when I left?" She huffs. "Never mind, it doesn't matter. I just want this trip to be over with."  
“我离开时，加持说了什么？”她哼了一声。“算了，不重要。我只希望这次旅行快点结束。”

That weariness has soaked into the very marrow of her bones. Even sitting up hurts, sends waves of pain barely countered by the anger that fills her for so many hours of the day. She climbs up the bed and lays her head on the crinkling pillow, stares up at the infinite night between herself and the ceiling.  
那份疲惫已渗入她骨髓深处。即便是坐起身来也疼痛难忍，一波波的痛楚几乎被她日复一日充斥的怒火所抵消。她爬上床，将头枕在沙沙作响的枕头上，仰望着自己与天花板之间那无尽的夜空。

"We're heading back to the dorms. You don't like being there either."  
“我们正回宿舍去。你也不喜欢那里。”

"I know. I know! You don't have to remind me, Ayanami. I don't _need_ your help. I don't _need_ any of this."  
“我知道。我知道！绫波，你不用提醒我。我不需要你的帮助。我根本不需要这一切。”

It's too dark to see in any clarity but there's a slight change in Rei's breathing that might be regret. Maybe sadness. When Rei sinks into the bed beside her, also facing up at the ceiling, the silence between them is expansive. Abyssal. Asuka hates it, hates that the first person she's connected with on even the smallest level in forever might have been offended at her words. She hates, just a little bit less, that she feels anything about Rei at all.  
光线太暗，看不清任何细节，但零的呼吸有了一丝微妙的变化，或许是后悔，也许是悲伤。当零躺到她身边，同样仰望天花板时，两人之间的沉默广阔而深邃。明日香讨厌这种沉默，讨厌自己久违地与人在最微小的层面上产生联系，对方却可能因自己的话而感到冒犯。她更讨厌的是，自己竟然对零有任何感觉。

She twists to lie on her side and face Rei before her mind catches up with the actions. There's a beat, a slow second where she watches the girl in profile. Rei has a soft face: oval and feminine even if her features are somewhat plain. Her long eyelashes match the cornflower blue of her hair, and her eyes, watching nothing on the ceiling, still keep her thoughts hidden behind a flat shine. Rei's breasts are small, molded delicately like the rest of her, but their shape is entrancing and they heave when her chest expands with her breaths. Asuka finds herself taken by the sight.  
她侧身转向零，脸对着脸，动作先于思绪。有那么一瞬间，她静静地观察着零的侧脸。零的面容柔和：椭圆形的脸庞，即使五官略显平淡，也透着女性的柔美。她那长长的睫毛与天蓝色发丝相映成趣，而她的眼睛，虽然凝视着天花板上的虚空，却依旧将思绪隐藏在一片平静的光泽之后。零的胸部小巧，与她整体的精致相得益彰，随着呼吸起伏，其形状令人着迷。明日香发现自己被这景象深深吸引。

Then taken by Rei's eyes, when she finally turns onto her own side to stare back at Asuka. Rei's mouth is closed, her lips darker than her skin in the night, flush with blood. The urge to speak is filling Asuka. She needs to fill the distance, color the silence with words or nonsense and Rei sure isn't going to do that.  
随后，被绫波的目光所吸引，当她终于转过身来与明日香对视时。绫波的嘴紧闭着，她的唇色在夜色中比肌肤更深，因血液而显得红润。说话的冲动在明日香心中涌动。她需要填补这段距离，用言语或无意义的声响为沉默着色，而绫波显然不会这么做。

So she leans in and kisses Rei. She captures the girl's lips, and those two lips might just be the warmest thing on the girl's body. They're wet too, and soft, and surprisingly Rei kisses her back with nearly as much energy. Maybe Rei had been waiting to do this for a long time. Maybe Asuka herself had. But it's better than silence, and the sound of Rei's breathing sends chills up her spine. Her hands hold the other girl's face where she had once slapped Rei, and the irony doesn't escape her.  
于是她倾身吻了绫波。她捕捉到了女孩的双唇，那两片唇或许是女孩身上最温暖的部分。它们湿润而柔软，令人惊讶的是，绫波以几乎同样的热情回应了她的吻。也许绫波已经等待这一刻很久了。也许明日香自己也是。但这比沉默要好，绫波的呼吸声让她脊背发凉。她的双手捧着曾经掌掴过的那张脸，其中的讽刺意味并未被她忽略。

It was a mistake, though, to do this. A mistake. Her chest trembles in slow waves that grow into rapid quakes. This kiss is right. It is very, very wrong. The fog of her confusion only deepens until she's lost in the emotions that fill her rib cage and sink her stomach and curdle her brain. The shaking in her chest reaches her shoulders, travels up her arms and down to her hands until she can't grasp Rei's face tightly enough but she's trying she's trying because Rei is all she has right now, she's all that exists outside of Asuka and her tears are timed to the rumble of thunder outside that rattle the window. Rei's hands brush through her hair so gently that Asuka chokes as she cries. Everything is a barbed wire loop, everything is a burning circle, everything is at once too much and too little to matter at all, now and never. Her tears are hot and angry and bitter and she hates herself more than ever before because even this, even something she can't lie to herself about desiring, is being ruined by her own heart.  
这样做是个错误，一个错误。她的胸膛缓缓起伏，逐渐转为剧烈的颤抖。这个吻本应是正确的，却错得离谱。她的困惑如迷雾般加深，直至迷失在充斥胸腔、沉入腹中、搅乱思绪的情感之中。胸中的颤抖蔓延至肩膀，沿手臂而下，直至双手，她无法紧紧抓住绫波的脸，但她仍在努力，因为此刻绫波是她唯一的依靠，是除明日香之外唯一的存在，她的泪水与窗外雷鸣同步，震颤着窗户。绫波的手轻抚她的发丝，温柔得让明日香哽咽哭泣。一切如同带刺的铁丝圈，一切如同燃烧的圆环，一切既过于沉重又微不足道，此刻与永恒。她的泪水滚烫、愤怒、苦涩，她比以往任何时候都更憎恨自己，因为即使这份无法自欺的渴望，也被自己的心所毁。

"Maybe, some day, you won't feel like you have to cry so often." Rei whispers against her lips after Asuka's stop moving. It's incredible that Rei can say things like that so normally, so straightforward. The redhead can taste her own tears. She's sure Rei can too.  
"或许有一天，你不会那么频繁地感到需要哭泣。" 在明日香停止动作后，绫波在她唇边低语。绫波能如此自然、直白地说出这样的话，真是不可思议。红发少女尝到了自己的泪水，她确信绫波也能尝到。

"Shut up." She answers before turning her back to Rei and curling into herself.  
"闭嘴。" 她回答后，转身背对绫波，蜷缩成一团。

Outside of their room the storm stretches still further into the horizon over the ocean. They cannot see the flashes - the curtains are too thick - but Asuka believes she can feel the lightning scar the sky in jagged wounds that time themselves to the stuttering beat of her heart.  
在她们的房间外，风暴依旧向着海洋的地平线延伸。她们看不见闪电——窗帘太厚了——但明日香相信自己能感受到闪电在天空中划出锯齿状的伤口，与她心跳的断断续续的节奏同步。

**Part 9 第 9 部分**

She sees it as punishment, having to study here in this dank room with _Shinji_ of all people. The Hakone School of the Arts' library is a small, cramped space where blocky, disheveled bookshelves don't tower so much as they crowd and push like commuters on a rush hour train. The mold smell that permeates the rest of the school is concentrated in this one room, as if the place had once been flooded and the books that survived festered with sickly mildew. Asuka sees the table where Shinji sits from where she stands, and she knows that whether she squats between the sticky-floored aisles or shares the table with her spineless classmate, she can't leave.  
她将此视为惩罚，不得不在这个阴暗的房间里与真嗣一起学习。箱根艺术学校的图书馆是一个狭小拥挤的空间，那些笨重凌乱的书架并不高耸，而是像高峰期的通勤者一样拥挤推搡。弥漫在整个学校的霉味在这个房间里尤为集中，仿佛这里曾被洪水淹没，幸存下来的书籍都带着病态的霉菌。从她站立的位置，明日香可以看到真嗣坐着的桌子，她知道无论她蹲在粘腻的过道间还是与她那软弱的同学共用桌子，她都无法离开。

"Asuka?" Shinji calls out from his seat. He's been watching her for a minute or two now, his eyes sticking to her in a way she isn't sure is perverted, but sure makes her uncomfortable. His voice is like a wilting flower, struggling to stretch to her ears and ending in futility, bent and weak. She hates it, hates him, but they were paired up and she has no choice but to tolerate him. She's on thin ice as it is, what with the scene she caused at the hotel. Shame, like mold, only grows more as darkness and wetness compounds it. Asuka needs the sun to shine on her again to clear out all of the blight.  
"明日香？" 真嗣从座位上呼唤道。他已经盯着她看了一两分钟，他的目光紧紧地粘在她身上，她不确定这是否下流，但肯定让她感到不舒服。他的声音像一朵枯萎的花，挣扎着伸展到她的耳边，最终徒劳无功，弯曲而无力。她讨厌这样，讨厌他，但他们被配对在一起，她别无选择，只能忍受他。她已经处于薄冰之上，尤其是在酒店里闹出的那一幕之后。羞耻，就像霉菌，只会随着黑暗和潮湿的加剧而增长。明日香需要阳光再次照耀她，以清除所有的污点。

"What." It's barely a question.  
"什么。" 这几乎算不上一个问题。

"I think I have enough books on Brahms if...if you'd like to share."  
"我想我已经有足够的关于勃拉姆斯的书了，如果你愿意的话，我们可以分享。"

She looks him up and down, huffs a sigh, and pulls out a chair beside him. It scrapes against the floor and Asuka takes some pleasure in the way Shinji cringes at the sound.  
她上下打量了他一番，叹了口气，然后在他旁边拉出一张椅子。椅子刮擦地板的声音让明日香感到一丝快意，因为真嗣对此声音显得有些畏缩。

"Do you want to take the early life section, or?"  
“你想负责早年的部分，还是？”

"I don't need your help, I can do the whole thing myself if I have to."  
“我不需要你的帮助，如果必须的话，我可以自己完成整个项目。”

"But Mr. Kaji said that we should split the work? We were paired together to learn more about Brahms to help us with - with understanding what we're playing."  
"但卡吉先生说我们应该分工合作？我们被配对在一起，是为了更深入地了解布拉姆斯，以便帮助我们——帮助我们理解我们正在演奏的内容。"

"He said that because he doesn't trust you dimwits to actually be able to do a full report. I'm sure he knows that I can."  
"他说那话是因为他不相信你们这些笨蛋能真正完成一份完整的报告。我确信他知道我能做到。"

She watches Shinji open his mouth to speak, then close it while he thinks of something else to say. Again, the way she can shut the boy down, how uncomfortable he looks when she's around - she loves it. Loves the power. At least here and now she doesn't feel as if she can't do the one thing she's been training her whole life to do.  
她看着真嗣张开嘴想要说话，然后又闭上，思考着其他要说的话。再次，她能轻易让这男孩闭嘴，他当她面露出的那种不自在——她喜欢这种感觉。喜欢这种力量。至少在这里，此刻，她不觉得自己无法做到她一生都在训练自己去做的事情。

"I'm sure that's true," he finally says. It looks like he has more to add, an _and_ or a _but_, some conjunction that could connect his thoughts to hers, and yet nothing else comes out of his mouth. It's easily evident that Shinji has problems connecting to others. The slump of his shoulders when he's out of class, like he's hiding his head to avoid his classmates, the nervous jitter of his eyes when he's in public - Kaworu not withstanding, Shinji must be very lonely. Even his own sister avoids him. Asuka knows what it's like to be alone. A life like an empty plastic package retaining the shape of what was there, and a constant reminder of what won't be back.  
"我确信那是真的，"他终于说道。看起来他还有话要说，一个'而且'或'但是'，某个能将他的想法与她的联系起来的连词，然而他的嘴里再没有吐出任何话语。显然，真嗣在与人交流方面存在困难。下课后他肩膀的低垂，仿佛在躲避同学，在公共场合时他眼神的紧张颤动——除了薰以外，真嗣一定非常孤独。甚至连他自己的妹妹都避开他。明日香知道孤独是什么滋味。生活就像一个空塑料包装，保持着里面曾经存在的东西的形状，不断提醒着那些不会再回来的事物。

What she doesn't understand is how Shinji just curls up, a scared cat in a cardboard box on the side of the road. How he lets the world tower over him and casts his eyes to the ground. Weakness is a stench on him, like body odor, and she can smell it from a mile off sour and rank. She's managed to keep herself clean of that. At least, she's tried her hardest.  
她不明白的是，真嗣如何蜷缩起来，就像路边纸箱里的一只受惊的猫。他如何让世界压倒自己，目光投向地面。软弱在他身上是一种臭味，如同体味，她从一英里外就能闻到那酸臭的气息。她设法让自己远离那种气息。至少，她已经尽了最大努力。

"Anyway, just pass over a few of those books, alright? Don't get them sweaty, the way your hands always are."  
"不管怎样，就递几本书过来，好吗？别让它们沾上你手上的汗。"

"Hey!" "嘿！"

She drags her finger down the pages and her eyes follow, a wake of words that don't hold water in her mind. Brahms had an interesting life, sure - a child prodigy so skilled in both composition and performance that he struggled to balance his time between the two - but she doesn't see how knowing any of this is important. Brahms wrote some good music, but he's dead now. He's dead, and it's Asuka's time to shine.  
她手指顺着页面滑动，目光随之移动，一串串文字在她脑海中却留不下痕迹。勃拉姆斯的一生确实有趣——一个在作曲和演奏上都天赋异禀的神童，以至于他难以平衡两者的时间——但她不明白了解这些有何重要。勃拉姆斯写过一些好音乐，但他现在已经去世了。他已逝去，现在是明日香发光的时候了。

"He isn't known for it," Shinji states, interrupting Asuka as she completes a paragraph. She looks him over, eyes narrowed, but says nothing. "But Brhams knew some cello too. I'm kind of happy to learn that."  
"他并不以此闻名，" 真嗣说道，打断了正在读完一段的明日香。她眯起眼睛打量着他，但什么也没说。"不过勃拉姆斯也懂一些大提琴。得知这一点，我还挺高兴的。"

He doesn't look at her as he says this. He's smiling at his paper with strange focus, genuinely happy about the little factoid he just picked up as if it were an interesting rock on the sidewalk.  
他说这话时并没有看她。他正对着自己的论文露出奇怪的专注微笑，真心为刚刚捡到的小知识点感到高兴，仿佛那是人行道上的一块有趣的石头。

"Yeah?" she humors him. There isn't much else to do in the tiny library, and she's all but given up on the paper for now. Brahms and his life are too far away for her to care about even if his music is timeless. A paradox, the content overcoming the creator, the contextual brackets of time falling away in showsheets to reveal the true worth beneath.  
“是吗？”她顺着他的话逗趣。在这狭小的图书馆里实在无事可做，她几乎已经放弃了眼前的论文。勃拉姆斯和他的生活对她来说太遥远，以至于她根本不在乎，尽管他的音乐是永恒的。这是一个悖论，内容超越了创作者，时间的上下文框架在节目单中脱落，揭示出真正的价值所在。

"I like to think that, maybe once, he was just like us. Doing his best, trying to live up to this big shadow of musical history. His father," Shinji chokes on his words, though he looks far from crying. His face is red, his hands clenched. If there is anything in this boy that isn't pathetic, this is what it's borne. Asuka's not too impressed. Surprised, maybe. "His father was also a musician. I wonder how Brahms felt."  
“我喜欢这样想，也许曾经，他就像我们一样。尽其所能，试图活在这巨大的音乐历史阴影下。他的父亲，”真嗣说到这里哽咽了，尽管他看起来并不像要哭。他的脸涨得通红，双手紧握。如果这个男孩身上有什么不令人同情的地方，那就是这个。明日香并不太感到钦佩。或许有些惊讶。“他的父亲也是一位音乐家。我在想勃拉姆斯当时是什么感受。”

"Your father, that Gendo guy. Is he a musician?" Asuka asks. She assumes he is, but it's not a given. Perhaps he just likes control. Perhaps he is envious of what he can't do, and desires to own those who can.  
"你父亲，那个叫源堂的家伙。他是音乐家吗？" 明日香问道。她猜测他是，但这并非定论。或许他只是喜欢掌控。或许他嫉妒自己做不到的事，渴望拥有那些能做到的人。

Shinji's fearful eyes, large and brown and shaking, snap to Asuka. "You know?"  
真嗣那双充满恐惧的大眼睛，棕色的，颤抖着，猛地转向明日香。"你知道？"

"Rei's my roommate. And your sister."  
"绫波是我的室友。也是你的妹妹。"

"Daddy's little girl, you mean." Shinji says with a tone that implies some grinding disgust. At Rei. At his father. Maybe at himself.  
"爸爸的小公主，你是这个意思吧。" 真嗣说道，语气中透露出一种难以掩饰的厌恶。对零。对他的父亲。或许也包括他自己。

"You know her well enough, if that's what you think."  
"如果你这么认为，那你对她已经足够了解了。"

"Father was a musician, but he hasn't played anything professionally in years. Supposedly after mother passed, or so I'm told. He's focused only on raising the best student in her place since then."  
"父亲曾是音乐家，但多年来已不再从事专业演奏。据说是在母亲去世后，至少我是这么听说的。从那以后，他一心只想培养出能代替她的最优秀的学生。"

"And you weren't enough."  
"而你不够。"

"I don't care anymore." Shinji says, obviously lying to himself and Asuka alike. "He never wanted me in the first place."  
"我不在乎了。" 真嗣说道，显然是在对自己和明日香撒谎。"他一开始就没想要我。"

Between them, the unfinished report and the open books lay all but forgotten. Asuka wonders if Kaworu and Rei are working as poorly as she and Shinji. Then she wonders why any of it matters at all.  
在他们之间，未完成的报告和摊开的书本几乎被遗忘了。明日香想知道薰和绫波是否也像她和真嗣一样工作得不好。然后她又想知道这一切到底有什么意义。

"Who cares what you're father thinks?" she looks him in the eye as she says this. "It means nothing. Do everything for yourself and forget everyone else." Asuka declares. It feels like the right thing to say. It's what she herself wants to believe. There are days when she does. There are far more when she doesn't.  
"谁在乎你父亲怎么想？" 她直视他的眼睛说道。"那毫无意义。为自己而活，忘掉其他人。" 明日香宣称。这感觉像是该说的话。也是她自己想要相信的。有些日子她确实这么做了。但更多的时候，她做不到。

Avoiding her eyes, it looks more like Shinji is going to ignore her. Still, as he flips through another biography, he says with the smallest of smiles, "Thank you, Asuka."  
避开她的目光，真嗣看起来更像是要无视她。然而，当他翻阅另一本传记时，他带着一丝微笑说道："谢谢你，明日香。"

It's a warm sentiment. Sweet in a way she didn't expect. Sticky, but like a cinnamon bun and not the floor in the room. Wholesome.  
这是一种温暖的情感。出乎意料的甜蜜。黏腻，但像肉桂卷而不像房间地板。很纯粹。

It catches her off guard, a line drive when you expect a pop fly. Something venomous flows to the tip of her tongue like acidic spit, but she can't get it past her teeth. She hates Shinji. She hates all of this. The angry rebuttal still never forms. She turns back to the work instead. Easier to be buried in the words of a dead man than face the live one beside her.  
这让她措手不及，本以为会是高飞球，却来了个直线快球。某种恶毒的话语如酸性唾液般涌到她的舌尖，但她就是无法让它越过牙齿。她讨厌真嗣。她讨厌这一切。那愤怒的反驳始终未能形成。她转而埋头于工作。与其面对身边的活人，不如沉浸在已故之人的文字中。

When the color scheme of the day shifts to evening hues her eyes are drawn to flashes of blue and gray at the library entrance. Rei is standing beside Kaworu, her face composed, her red eyes settled on Asuka resolutely, assuredly, rightly. Something uncomfortable itches in Asuka's chest as if she swallowed stinging nettles that roll around her ribcage. Beneath her breath she mutters something about impatience and slams her books closed, gathers her things in a messy pile she shoves into her book bag. Organization is never a priority for the rushed in the way it is a privilege for those who take their time.  
当天的色彩逐渐转为傍晚的色调时，她的目光被图书馆入口处闪烁的蓝灰色吸引。绫波站在薰旁边，面容平静，红眼睛坚定地、自信地、正确地注视着明日香。明日香感到胸口有种不舒服的刺痛，仿佛吞下了刺人的荨麻，在她的肋骨间滚动。她低声嘟囔着关于急躁的话，砰地一声合上书本，把东西胡乱堆成一堆塞进书包。对于匆忙的人来说，组织从来不是优先考虑的事，而对于那些从容不迫的人来说，这是一种特权。

"We did good today," Shinji looks up from collecting his own things with hopeful eyes. Again, the sentiment prickles Asuka's skin. All of this...niceness, team work. She's unsuited for it.  
“我们今天做得不错，”真嗣一边收拾自己的东西，一边用充满希望的眼神抬头说道。又一次，这种情感让明日香感到刺痛。所有这些...善意，团队合作。她不适合这些。

"The report doesn't matter. What matters is how we do at the show next week. Don't get a big head."  
"这份报告无关紧要。重要的是我们下周在演出中的表现。别得意忘形。"

Asuka pushes past both of her other band mates and into the crowded hall; with the emergence of the evening, students coalesce into a mingled mass on their way to and from the cafeteria. This stupid report threw off her usual schedule and she wants to eat so that she can get on with her life. It isn't a surprise when Rei catches up and keeps in step. She didn't have to look to know that the girl would. At this point she can sense Rei through some primitive receiver in her brain, a left over from the ancient past. It's not as if she could rely on hearing Rei, or on seeing past the hazy aura of her existence. Asuka has to rely on her other senses: the animal warmth of Rei, the human scent mingling with whatever fragrance Rei calls her own. Or on taste. Her eyes flick to Rei's pale pink lips. She looks away, red faced. On touch. Asuka's body reacts instinctually, some buzzing blood around her heart, a singing in her skin, Her hand drifts until it slides against the soft porcelain of Rei's skin. Then she jolts it back to her own body, clutches her teal skirt tightly in a fist, coughs.  
明日香推开其他两位乐队成员，挤进了拥挤的大厅；随着夜幕降临，学生们在大厅与食堂之间形成了一片混杂的人群。这份愚蠢的报告打乱了她平时的日程，她只想吃饭，然后继续她的生活。当零追上来并保持同步时，她并不感到惊讶。她甚至不需要看就知道零会这么做。到这个地步，她的大脑中仿佛有一个古老的接收器能感知到零，这是从远古时代遗留下来的。她不能依赖听到零的声音，也不能透过零存在的朦胧光环看到她。明日香必须依赖其他感官：零身上的动物般的温暖，人类气息与零自己特有的香味混合。或者是味觉。她的目光扫过零那淡粉色的嘴唇。她转过头去，脸颊泛红。还有触觉。明日香的身体本能地反应，心脏周围血液嗡鸣，皮肤上仿佛有歌声。她的手不由自主地飘向零，轻轻触碰到零柔软如瓷的皮肤。然后她猛地把手抽回，紧紧抓住自己的蓝绿色裙子，握成拳头，咳嗽了一声。

"Have a good evening, Asuka." Kaworu calls with his smirking voice. She knows he saw the whole thing. She knows that he knows that _she knows_ he saw the whole thing. It takes most of her self control not to turn around and slap him.  
"晚上好，明日香。" 薰带着他那抹微笑的声音喊道。她知道他目睹了整个过程。她知道他知道她知道他目睹了整个过程。她几乎用尽所有自制力才没有转身给他一巴掌。

But it's while she travels through the dusty halls and cramped passages of the school listening to Rei discuss the boring ins-and-outs of her far more successful afternoon with Kaworu that Asuka is struck - blindsided - by the fact that she truly feels content. Feels uninhibited, untroubled joy in the simple turn of events as they fell before her in neat rows: the comfortingly mundane day of classes, the after-school project and conversation with Shinji, being picked up by Rei (which was an unplanned and gently pleasant surprise). The boring, innocent delight of knowing there's someone waiting for you to share your uneventful day with as it becomes an uneventful night. The domestic bliss of an unexceptional life.  
然而，当她在学校那尘土飞扬的走廊和狭窄的通道中穿行，听着零讨论她与薰更为成功的下午的乏味细节时，明日香突然被一种感觉击中——猝不及防——她真的感到满足。感受到一种无拘无束、无忧无虑的喜悦，随着事件井然有序地展开：那些令人安心的平凡课堂日子，放学后的项目和与真嗣的对话，被零接走（这是一个未计划且温和愉快的惊喜）。知道有人等着与你分享你平淡无奇的一天，直到它变成一个平淡无奇的夜晚，这种无聊、纯真的快乐。平凡生活中的家庭幸福。

This is the first time she has had so much to lose, and despite that, like discovering a vulnerable animal alone in the rain, it is unexpected and humbling and pitiable all at once.  
这是她第一次拥有这么多值得失去的东西，尽管如此，就像在雨中发现一只脆弱的孤兽，这种感觉既出乎意料又令人谦卑，同时又令人同情。

It's the most terrified she has felt in a long time.  
这是她很久以来感到最害怕的一次。

**Part 10 第 10 部分**

Asuka perfected applying makeup at age 11.  
明日香在 11 岁时就已精通化妆技巧。

She remembers that span of a week well. Her mother slowly decaying in the hospital again, blank-eyed when Asuka went to visit her, blank-eyed when she left. Father already gone a year and calling even less than he did when he was around. The nurses didn't have time for her, not like they did when she was 7 or 8.  
她清晰记得那一周的时光。母亲再次在医院中日渐衰弱，明日香探望时她目光空洞，离开时亦是如此。父亲已离世一年，连电话都比他在世时更少。护士们无暇顾及她，不像她七八岁时那样。

So she stole her mother's makeup kit. Her mother kept it beneath the vanity mirror where she would fix herself up before shows, before traveling or going out on the town. Rituals helped keep her in line, or they were supposed to. Asuka liked to sit next to her mother, hear her talk about music, about people she played with and liked, or played with and hated, or wanted to play with as she applied foundation, gave life and length to her lashes.  
于是她偷走了母亲的化妆包。母亲总是将其藏在梳妆镜下，每次演出前、旅行或外出前都会精心打扮。这些仪式本应让她保持状态，或者说本该如此。明日香喜欢坐在母亲旁边，听她谈论音乐，谈论她合作过并喜欢或讨厌的人，或是她渴望合作的人，同时涂抹粉底，赋予睫毛生命与长度。

Asuka spent that week clutching her doll and staring into the streaky mirror of a hospital bathroom applying makeup, staining her lips, coloring her cheeks, powdering her skin. It took days and days until she thought she looked good. A nurse caught her on the first day, scrubbed her cheeks until they were raw and red and stung like she had been slapped. But she got better. Learned the basics quickly, learned what didn't work. She has always been a quick learner. When her mother got better - for some time, at least - at the end of that week, she stopped wearing it. Doesn't wear it normally, saves it for those special occasions. Like concerts. Like recitals. Like Germany.  
那一周，明日香紧抱着她的玩偶，凝视着医院洗手间里斑驳的镜子，涂抹着化妆品，染红双唇，点缀脸颊，扑上粉底。她花了好几天时间，直到觉得自己看起来不错。第一天，一位护士发现了她，用力擦洗她的脸颊，直到它们变得通红，火辣辣的，就像被掌掴了一样。但她进步很快，迅速掌握了基础，明白了哪些方法行不通。她向来学得快。当她的母亲病情好转——至少有一段时间——那周结束时，她就不再化妆了。她通常不化妆，只在特殊场合才用。比如音乐会。比如演奏会。比如德国。

Like now. 就像现在。

She's locked the door to the communal bathroom in her wing of the dorm building. It's easy for her to ignore the pounding of the other girls outside, the calls of _"I'm getting a janitor!"_, as calmly applies foundation. Rituals help keep her in line, or they are supposed to. The mirror in the bathroom, cheap as it is (like everything else in this school, she thinks) is still better than the one in her and Rei's room. She goes on methodically, focusing on the brushes, on the powders and applicators, taking belly deep breaths to calm her heart. The show is in an hour and a half. She's mortified.  
她锁上了宿舍楼自己这一侧公共浴室的门。对她来说，忽视外面其他女孩的敲门声和喊着“我要叫管理员了！”的呼声很容易，她平静地涂抹着粉底。仪式有助于让她保持镇定，或者说应该是这样。浴室里的镜子虽然廉价（就像这所学校里的其他东西一样，她想），但仍然比她和绫波的房间里的那面要好。她有条不紊地继续着，专注于刷子、粉末和涂抹器，深呼吸以平复心跳。演出在一个半小时后开始。她感到非常害怕。

"Asuka." Rei calls through the door, seemingly unbothered by the entire situation. "Kaji wants us in 15 minutes."  
“明日香。”绫波隔着门喊道，似乎对整个情况毫不在意。“加持先生要我们在 15 分钟内到。”

"Kaji can wait. I have to be perfect before I step out onto that stage, and I mean _perfect_. Tonight's the night I show everyone exactly what I can do."  
“加持可以等。我必须完美地走上舞台，我是说完美。今晚我要向所有人展示我到底能做什么。”

Her hand shakes. She grinds her teeth.  
她的手在颤抖。她咬紧牙关。

The dress she chose for tonight is the one she wore during her show in Germany. It fits her closely - but not _too_ closely - and ends near her knees in the slightest of flares. The neckline is on the safe side of teasing, the back neat and tasteful, and zippered up. She looks good and she knows it, but of course, the most important part is going to be how she plays. She closes her eyes, tries to imagine the blood pumping around her body, the energy in her hands and fingers and wrists. They must be perfect. they must be healthy. They must not fail her.  
她为今晚挑选的裙子，是她在德国演出时穿的那件。它紧贴她的身形——但不过分紧贴——裙摆微张至膝盖附近。领口恰到好处地挑逗，背部整洁而雅致，拉链已拉上。她看起来很美，她自己也清楚，但最重要的是她的演奏。她闭上眼睛，试图想象血液在体内奔涌，双手、手指和手腕的能量。它们必须完美。它们必须健康。它们绝不能让她失望。

She finishes tying her hair up neatly, slips two big clips on either side of her head, and nods to herself. Acceptable. Beautiful. Nerves on fire.  
她仔细地束好头发，两边各别上两个大发夹，然后对自己点了点头。可以了。美丽。紧张得像火一样。

Asuka is halfway through packing up her makeup when she's struck with a desire. It's stupid, but maybe it'll calm her down. At least that's what she rationalizes.  
明日香正在收拾她的化妆品，突然冒出一个念头。虽然很蠢，但或许能让她平静下来。至少她是这么说服自己的。

"Rei," she calls, walking towards the door, "You're still out there?"  
“绫波，”她边喊边走向门口，“你还在外面吗？”

Through the noise of the other girls' shrill complaints she listens for Rei's peculiar light switch voice to appear and disappear in a single moment, as it does. She's attuned to it now, can single out Rei's voice the way you can always make out a favorite song as it plays quietly through the muffled speakers of a crowded waiting room.  
在其他女孩尖锐的抱怨声中，她聆听着绫波那独特的、如开关般忽隐忽现的声音。现在她已经能敏锐地捕捉到它，就像在拥挤的候车室里，总能从模糊的扬声器中辨认出最爱的歌曲一样。

"I'm still here," Rei says. The words, monotone and concrete, still stir something nauseas in Asuka, who stomps to the door and pulls it open, grips Rei around the thin wrist to pull her in, and slams the door closed and locked in such a quick set of movements that the other girls don't even have time to react. Rei, for her part, isn't phased.  
"我还在这里," 绫波说。这平淡而坚定的话语，仍让明日香感到一阵恶心，她快步走向门口，一把拉开，抓住绫波纤细的手腕将她拽进来，随即砰地一声关上门并锁上，动作一气呵成，其他女孩甚至来不及反应。而绫波，一如既往地不为所动。

Asuka sees her for the first time in the outfit she'll wear for the concert. The dress is, surprisingly, a bit shorter than her own. The straps thinner, the fit looser just below the waist as it flares skirt-like, vaguely ruffled. She holds herself in the same way she always does, a weird combination of aloof and self-conscious, a hand grasping across her chest to hold onto the elbow of the other arm, her shoulders hunched just a bit as if she were hugging herself. Asuka can read the question in her otherwise guarded stare. The black dress grounds her, though, somehow contains all of the airiness that makes up Rei like a bottled fairy.  
明日香第一次看到她穿上演唱会要穿的服装。意外地，那裙子比自己的还要短一些。肩带更细，腰下部分略显宽松，裙摆呈伞状，略带褶皱。她依旧保持着一贯的姿态，一种既疏离又略带自我意识的奇怪组合，一只手横过胸前抓住另一只手臂的肘部，肩膀微耸，仿佛在拥抱自己。明日香能从她那戒备的眼神中读出疑问。然而，那黑色的裙子却将她固定住了，不知怎的，将绫波那飘渺的气质如同装在瓶中的精灵一般牢牢束缚。

But there's something beautiful about her too, maybe more now than ever. Rei's beauty is quietly youthful, a blooming meadow hidden in the woods, but the curve of her eyes and the set of her lips take on a maturity in her formal wear that impresses Asuka. She wants what Rei has. Wants Rei, even if she doesn't want to admit it to herself.  
但她身上也有一种美，或许现在比以往任何时候都更甚。绫波的美是静谧而年轻的，如同林中隐秘盛开的草地，但她的眼角和唇形在正装下显露出一种成熟，让明日香印象深刻。她渴望拥有绫波所拥有的。甚至渴望绫波本身，即使她不愿对自己承认这一点。

"God, have you never used makeup before?" Asuka asks instead. Rei shakes her head and stirs up her wispy locks.  
“天啊，你以前从没用过化妆品吗？”明日香问道。绫波摇了摇头，搅动着她那细软的发丝。

"I figured. Here...right, there isn't a seat...Oh, fine, just stand. There, by the mirror."  
“我猜也是。来……好吧，这里没有椅子……哦，算了，就站着吧。那边，对着镜子。”

When she takes her spot in front of Rei, Asuka is close enough to hear the soft sound of her breathing. She knows that it's a mistake to do this the moment her stupid heart beats even quicker than it had been when anxiety over failing was her only worry. She holds Rei's face in her hands. With a critical eye plans out what she wants to do to the girl to highlight, and not overpower, whatever lays beneath that intentionally blank facade.  
当她站在绫波面前时，明日香近得能听见她轻柔的呼吸声。她知道这样做是个错误，就在那一刻，她那愚蠢的心跳得比因担心失败而焦虑时还要快。她双手捧着绫波的脸。用挑剔的眼光规划着她想要对这个女孩所做的，以突出而不是压倒那有意无意的空白面具下隐藏的东西。

"You don't need a lot," Asuka judges. She catches herself halfway through the compliment, throws it in reverse. "Because your skin, it just won't do good with most of this."  
“你不需要太多，”明日香评价道。她半途意识到自己在赞美，便立刻收回。“因为你的皮肤，它不适合大多数这些东西。”

Rei, again, barely reacts. Asuka feels the other girl's eyes following her every movement, each stroke and swab. Her skin crawls in a way that might actually feel great.  
绫波再次几乎没有反应。明日香感觉到另一个女孩的眼睛紧随着她的每一个动作，每一笔涂抹。她的皮肤有种可能真的感觉很棒的刺痒感。

It's when Asuka's running lipstick along the crest of Rei's upper lip that she realizes she's leaning in, getting closer with every breath, her own lips inches away and _greedy_ to repeat their mistake from the hotel. She bites down hard, starts back. She can't actually like Rei, not like this. She can't want the girl for anything but a sounding board, but a cathartic release, but a joke. Asuka finishes up as quickly as she can holding her breath.  
就在明日香沿着绫波的上唇峰涂抹口红时，她意识到自己正倾身靠近，每一次呼吸都更近一步，自己的嘴唇也近在咫尺，贪婪地想要重蹈酒店的覆辙。她用力咬了咬唇，猛地后退。她不能真的喜欢绫波，不能以这种方式喜欢。她不能除了把绫波当作回音壁、宣泄口或笑料之外，还对她有其他想法。明日香尽可能快地屏住呼吸，迅速完成了涂抹。

"We're done, we're done!" She pinches Rei's hip, pretends it's for good luck and for nothing else. Her hands are shaking, clenched as they are at her sides. The bathroom suddenly feels smaller, Rei somehow closer. The other girl can't hide the confusion evident in her stare even as she stays silent, miming sensations. Without sound, emotion is only two-dimensional.  
“我们完成了，完成了！”她捏了捏绫波的臀部，假装是为了好运，别无他意。她的手在颤抖，紧握在身体两侧。浴室突然显得更狭小，绫波不知怎的更近了。另一个女孩无法掩饰眼中的困惑，尽管她保持沉默，模仿着感受。没有声音，情感就只是二维的。

"Come on." Asuka straightens her back, exhales hard. "I have a show to star in."  
"“走吧。”明日香挺直背，用力呼出一口气。“我还有一场演出要主演。””

---

It is 6pm on a Friday night. The stars outside are so bright they're fake, hanging in a black sky manufactured and ordered like light bulbs on a string. There are 10 minutes before the show starts and Asuka sneaks up to the platform where she practices, dodging beneath the rails to avoid the stares of the crew that has set up the lighting for the recital. It's the first time she's seen the auditorium full and alive. The people in their seats sit on permanent dust. Every chair in the place creaks. She can't make out individual faces - just peasant smiles and glassy eyes - not from this high up, but it stings her, bitter and cold, that she's not looking for anyone. There's no one left to come and see her. A ward of the state, a girl without a mother or father. She hardens her heart; it's just one more reason she has to be the best.  
时值周五晚六点，夜空中的星辰璀璨得仿佛赝品，悬挂于漆黑天幕，宛如一串串被制造并整齐排列的灯泡。距离演出开始仅剩十分钟，明日香悄然溜至她平日练习的平台，低头躲过栏杆，避开为独奏会布置灯光的工作人员目光。这是她首次目睹礼堂座无虚席、生机勃勃的景象。观众席上的每个人仿佛坐在永恒的尘埃之上，每把椅子都吱嘎作响。她无法辨认出具体的脸庞——只有朴实的微笑与空洞的眼神——并非因位置过高，而是刺痛她心扉，苦涩而冰冷，因为她并未寻找任何人。已无人会来观看她的表演。身为孤儿，一个无父无母的女孩，她坚定内心；这不过是她必须成为最优秀的又一个理由。

A deep breath and she mimes the movements of the piece again. Her left hand fingers madly dance through the measures in her head, her bow hand saws away at air and she bites her lip, internalizes the motions. She fights herself - a part of her knows that Kaji, that Gendo, that everyone is correct; she should reign herself in and control her emotions and the movements they spawn, the flames born from the embers of the furnace of her heart. But she knows too that nothing exemplifies her power - helps her exert dominance - like allowing the music inside to uncoil and explode, a natural event, an unstoppable expression of raw life. The back of her neck sweats. Her throat is constricting when the school headmaster, a lean old man with deep-set eyes, Mr. Fuyutsuki, walks onto the stage while she descends.  
深吸一口气，她再次模仿乐曲的动作。她的左手手指在脑海中疯狂地穿梭于各个小节，弓弦在空中挥舞，她咬着嘴唇，将动作内化。她在与自己斗争——一部分的她知道，碇、源堂，以及所有人都是对的；她应该克制自己，控制情绪及其引发的举动，那些由她内心的熔炉中迸发的火花所生的火焰。但她同样明白，没有什么比让内心的音乐释放并爆发更能彰显她的力量——帮助她施展威严——就像让音乐自然地展开，不可阻挡地表达着原始的生命力。她的后颈渗出汗水。当学校的校长，一位眼窝深陷的瘦削老人，冬月先生，走上舞台时，她的喉咙紧缩，正从台上走下。

Even when she touches the scuffed wooden floor, she feels as if there's truly no bottom.  
即使当她的脚触碰到磨损的木地板时，她仍感觉仿佛没有真正的底部。

---

If this recital has taught Asuka anything, it's that she truly _truly_ is the best musician at the Hakone School of Arts, without a doubt. She sits backstage, legs crossed, arms crossed, eyes narrowed, focused solely on the back of the heads of the woodwind group up on stage _massacring_ Ravel. She almost wants to get up and take those innocent instruments away from the awful idiots. Their play is sloppy. Their timing is off. And somehow, they still managed to be better than the _other_ chamber groups who'd played before them tonight. All of those people out in the stands subjecting themselves to this mess are artless, she thinks, tone deaf. Only a quarter of the way through the piece and her foot is tap tap tapping, she's raring to go. All doubt has left her mind. It's been kicked out. It breaks through her patience like hurricane winds against hastily thrown-together boards over windows.  
如果这场演奏会给明日香带来了什么启示，那就是她无疑是箱根艺术学校中最杰出的音乐家，毫无疑问。她坐在后台，双腿交叉，双臂交叉，眯着眼睛，全神贯注地盯着舞台上木管乐团那些正在糟蹋拉威尔作品的后脑勺。她几乎想要站起来，从那些糟糕的白痴手中夺走那些无辜的乐器。他们的演奏松散，节奏失调。然而，不知怎的，他们竟然比今晚之前演奏的其他室内乐团还要出色。她认为，那些坐在观众席上忍受这一切的人毫无艺术感，简直是音盲。乐曲才进行到四分之一，她的脚已经开始不停地敲打，她迫不及待想要上台。所有的疑虑都已从她心中被驱逐出去。它们像飓风般冲破了她耐心的防线，就像对着匆忙搭建的窗户板猛烈吹袭。

Rei stands beside her, a quiet, but not calming, presence. What little room Asuka has in her brain right now that isn't sharply focused on the recital is poking at the things she's been feeling about Rei, the way a doctor will prod the space around a wound to see what isn't broken. And broken - wounded - that's what this feels like, whatever _this_ is. She still hates Rei, or tells herself she has to. But nothing is clear anymore. Nothing is decisively one way or another. Ambiguity, like a smudged number on a check, smears any of her attempts to act logically.  
零站在她旁边，安静却并不让人心安。此刻，明日香脑海中除了对演奏的极度专注外，仅剩的空间都在探究她对零的感受，就像医生会轻触伤口周围，探查哪些部分尚未受损。而这种感觉——破碎的、受伤的——就是她此刻的体验，无论这是什么。她仍然讨厌零，或者说她告诉自己必须如此。但一切都不再明朗，没有一件事是绝对肯定的。模糊不清，就像支票上模糊的数字，涂抹了她试图理性行动的每一次尝试。

The woodwind group finishes, bows, and walks off high-fiving, arms around one another. True shows of friendship. Asuka's disgusted. She rolls her eyes at them, glad when they look away from her timidly. She sees Kaji signal them over from his position in the front of the stage, hears his introduction - their names, their places in the chamber group. Asuka's about to exit from behind the backstage threshold when she feels a tap on her shoulder.  
木管乐器组演奏完毕，鞠躬后互相击掌，搂着彼此离开。真切的友情展示。明日香对此感到厌恶。她对他们翻了个白眼，当他们怯生生地移开视线时，她感到一丝庆幸。她看到薰在舞台前方向他们招手，听到他介绍——他们的名字，他们在室内乐团中的位置。就在明日香准备从后台门槛处离开时，她感到有人轻拍了她的肩膀。

She spins on her heel, not ready to see Rei and unwilling to ignore her all the same. But it's not Rei; Kaworu is trying on an expression of concern for what appears to be the first time in his life, a little smile mismatched with the too-dramatic tilt of his eyebrows.  
她猛地转身，既不想见到绫波，又无法对她视而不见。但那并非绫波；渚薰正尝试着一生中第一次流露出关切的神情，嘴角微微上扬的笑容与过于夸张的眉毛倾斜显得格格不入。

"You better have a reason to bother me right now. We have a show to play."  
你最好现在打扰我有充分的理由。我们还有演出要进行。

"You're so tense you're shaking." Kaworu points out. She huffs, stays silent. She's just gearing up. Containing her energy is as easy as containing her emotions. So, impossible. Out of the corner of her eye Asuka watches Rei turn her face away. Why, she's not sure. "If you just let yourself relax I think it will do you well. None of this matters all that much, what matters is how you feel about it."  
你紧张得都在发抖了。"渚薰指出。她哼了一声，保持沉默。她只是在积蓄力量。控制自己的能量就像控制自己的情绪一样容易。也就是说，根本不可能。从眼角余光中，明日香看到绫波转过脸去。为什么，她不确定。"如果你能让自己放松下来，我想这对你有好处。这些都不重要，重要的是你对它的感受。

Bile claws its way up her throat. It's hard not to spit on Kaworu. He may as well have just called slapped her in the face.  
胆汁艰难地涌上她的喉咙。很难不向薰吐口水，他简直就像刚刚扇了她一巴掌。

"I am going to prove to everyone in this God-forsaken Hell hole that I am more than this school. _You_ will not get in my way."  
我要向这个该死的鬼地方里的每个人证明，我远不止是这所学校。你休想挡我的路。

She glances over at Rei, who gives her a tiny smile. One of the few she's ever given, it seems. Asuka's knees go weak. She walks to the stage that much faster just to get away from it.  
她瞥了一眼绫波，后者给了她一个微小的微笑。这似乎是她为数不多的笑容之一。明日香的膝盖发软，她加快脚步走向舞台，只想快点逃离这微笑。

If the view from the catwalk set the mood, it's the view from the stage that sets the tone. Even sitting on a folding chair, she can see the faces of the audience much more clearly: the mothers and fathers, the talent scouts hidden among family members, and - and Gendo, Gendo Ikari, Rei's father, front and center. Her heart beats faster. But that's fine. This will all be fine.  
如果说从天桥上看到的景象奠定了情绪基调，那么从舞台上看到的景象则定下了氛围。即便坐在折叠椅上，她也能更清晰地看到观众的面孔：那些母亲和父亲，隐藏在家人中的星探，还有——还有源渡，源渡·碇，绫波的父亲，正坐在最前面。她的心跳加速了。但没关系。一切都会好的。

She closes her eyes. Ignores the vibrating thrum of her heart that beats like a hummingbird's wings. Hears Kaji tapping his baton on the music stand in front of him. Hears Shinji cough, hears Kaworu crack his knuckles, feels - somehow feels Rei breathing through her skin, through the atoms sizzling between them. Time is nothing, then, not a chain of events, not a loop. She lifts her violin to her cheek, leans against it. Holds the bow inches above the strings, hovering with the suspense of a slasher's knife. Breaths out.  
她闭上眼睛。忽略那如蜂鸟翅膀般快速跳动的心跳声。听到加持用指挥棒轻敲他面前的乐谱架。听到真嗣咳嗽，听到薰活动手指关节，感觉到——不知怎的，感觉到绫波通过她的皮肤呼吸，通过他们之间噼啪作响的原子。时间此刻什么也不是，不是一连串的事件，也不是循环。她将小提琴举到脸颊旁，倚靠在上面。握着弓悬停在琴弦上方，如同恐怖片中悬而未决的刀锋。呼出一口气。

Kaji taps one last time and she feels at once centered in herself and a part of the group. Split between watching Kaji's baton dance its four-count rhythm and tracing the equation of notes that forms the beautiful music she plays, Asuka doesn't have time for worrying. Doesn't have time for anything but being the best - or, really, keeping herself in the number one place, because no one's even come close to taking her off her game. She slices the strings back and forth, again and again, not holding back in the slightest. The rest are stubborn, though - her chamber group is playing more reserved, more controlled - and well, she has to admit grudgingly, that they're good too. She slows her hands. Just a little. Just enough. Tries to canal the emotion in her heart. Grant the pace a little more respect.  
卡吉轻敲最后一下，她立刻感到自己既处于中心又融入了团队。一边注视着卡吉的指挥棒舞动出四拍节奏，一边追随着构成美妙音乐的音符方程式，明日香无暇担忧。她没有时间去想其他事情，只能全力以赴——或者更确切地说，保持自己第一的位置，因为至今无人能撼动她的地位。她来回切割着琴弦，一次又一次，毫不保留。然而其他人也很顽固——她的室内乐团演奏得更为内敛、更为克制——而且，她不得不勉强承认，他们也很出色。她放慢了双手的速度。只是一点点。恰到好处。试图引导内心的情感。给予节奏更多的尊重。

For a moment, it works. Even with the sweat building up on her brow, on her palms, she can do it.  
有那么一刻，这奏效了。即使额头和手掌上的汗水不断积累，她也能做到。

Like happiness, success is fleeting. Her finger slips on the C string. A small slip, doesn't even register on the Richter scale. No one noticed. But she did. There, in front of the audience - there, live on stage - she made a mistake. Everything in her begins to tumble; it breaks and snaps and then there is nothing in her. Blink, vanished. She wants to laugh but suddenly it's impossible to even open her eyes. How can she worry about how much emotion she puts into her music when, in an instant, everything has disappeared inside of her. Pressure hasn't turned her passion to diamond, it's crushed everything down into unknowable rubble.  
如同幸福，成功亦是转瞬即逝。她的手指在 C 弦上滑了一下。小小的失误，甚至未能在里氏震级上留下痕迹。无人察觉。但她自己知道。就在观众面前——就在舞台现场——她犯了一个错误。她内心的一切开始崩塌；破碎断裂，然后空无一物。眨眼间，消失无踪。她想笑，却突然连睁开眼睛都变得不可能。当一瞬间内心的一切都已消失，她又怎能顾及自己在音乐中投入了多少情感。压力并未将她的热情凝结成钻石，而是将一切碾压成无法辨识的碎石。

She drops her bow. Lets go of the violin, which cries out hollow and sharp as it thwacks against the floor. When she hops off the stage she wobbles, nearly falls, the heel of one shoe snapping, but it does not hold her back, her hair whipping behind her as she dashes towards the door, out into the cold night and the colder embrace of solitary despair.  
她松开弓，任由小提琴空洞而尖锐地撞击地面。当她跳下舞台时，脚步踉跄，几乎跌倒，一只鞋跟断裂，但这并未阻挡她，她的头发在身后飞扬，她朝着门口冲去，投入寒冷夜晚和更冷酷的孤独绝望怀抱。

**Part 11 第十一章**

There is nothing. There are colors and sounds. There is light, there is darkness. There is nothing. There is nothing.  
一无所有。只有色彩与声响。有光明，有黑暗。一无所有。一无所有。

**Part 12 第十二章**

Asuka is later told that five days have passed since the show.  
后来，明日香被告知，距离那场演出已经过去了五天。

There is nothing, first, before there is the sight of cloudy water ebbing and flowing with the most minute movements of her body. Warm water, soapy but no longer all that bubbly. She must've been in here for a while. The water settles just above her breasts; everything higher up is colder, exposed to the air, and her damp hair prickles her bony shoulders. The distinct smell of chlorine or bleach - something strong and clean and unnatural spikes her nose. She battles with every breath exiting her lungs. She suffers bone deep. Exhaustion has settled into her body, dulled only by how far away her mind has floated from her flesh.  
起初，眼前只有朦胧的水波随着她身体的微小动作起伏。温暖的水，带着肥皂味却不再泡沫丰富。她必定已在浴室待了许久。水面恰好漫过她的胸脯；其上的肌肤因暴露在空气中而感到寒冷，湿漉漉的头发刺痛着她瘦削的肩膀。一股刺鼻的氯气或漂白剂味——强烈、洁净却又不自然，直冲她的鼻腔。每一次呼吸都像是在与外界抗争。她感到深入骨髓的痛苦。疲惫已渗入她的身体，唯有思绪飘离肉体，才稍得缓解。

She closes her eyes. Darkness comforts when it doesn't frighten, and right now she craves comfort in a wordless way. From somewhere in front of her comes the measured plop of water dropping out of the closed faucet. The sound rings out loudly in the empty, echoing space around Asuka. Everything is empty in her right now. Finally. Maybe forever. No anger, no anxiety, no ambition. Just a mind like the vacuum of space, just a consciousness like a unfurnished room. Footsteps slap across the floor from off to the right. She doesn't turn her head to look. She just stares at her bare knees through soap-murky water. They look like barren hilltops, the skin pink and creased.  
她闭上眼睛。黑暗在不被恐惧笼罩时给予慰藉，此刻她无言地渴望着安慰。从她前方某处传来水滴从关闭的水龙头中滴落的规律声响。这声音在空旷、回响的空间中显得格外响亮，围绕着明日香。她此刻内心空无一物。终于。或许永远。没有愤怒，没有焦虑，没有野心。只有如真空般的心灵，只有如未布置的房间般的意识。脚步声从右侧传来，拍打在地板上。她没有转头去看。她只是透过肥皂水模糊的视线凝视着自己裸露的膝盖。它们看起来像荒芜的山顶，皮肤粉红且布满皱褶。

There's a squelching sound coming from above her head, followed by the springy plop of a viscous liquid, and then hands - there are hands and fingers in her hair, gently, smoothly, methodically massaging her scalp, passing through her locks until soapy suds begin to roll down her forehead and spread out against the thin expanse of her shoulders.  
头顶上传来一阵咕噜声，紧接着是黏稠液体弹跳的扑通声，然后是手——有手和手指在她的头发中，轻柔、平滑、有条不紊地按摩着她的头皮，穿过她的发丝，直到肥皂泡沫开始从她的额头滚落，蔓延至她纤细的肩部。

She gulps in her first breath in months. She looks up.  
她深吸了一口气，这是几个月来的第一口呼吸。她抬头望去。

A flash-bulb memory alights a shadow in her heart. She thinks of her mother. How her mother bathed her as a child in one of her few expressions of normal parental activity. How her mother would hum pieces she'd play later on in concerts. How Asuka's whole life had been built, structured, on orchestral music and a cultural history that was only half hers, but fully nourishing.  
一道闪光灯记忆在她心中点亮了一抹阴影。她想起了母亲。想起母亲在她小时候为她洗澡，这是她为数不多的正常亲子活动之一。想起母亲会哼唱她后来在音乐会上演奏的曲子。想起自己的一生是如何建立在交响乐和文化历史之上，这些文化只有一半属于她，却完全滋养着她。

Rei doesn't hum. That's okay, it's just as well. Asuka blames her hot tears on the soap falling into her eyes.  
绫波不会哼唱。这没关系，也挺好。明日香把热泪归咎于肥皂水溅入了眼睛。

"You've been gone for five days." Rei says, her voice still that high soft monotone as if what she said wasn't out of the ordinary. As if a business week of Asuka's life hasn't vanished.  
“你已经离开五天了。”绫波说，她的声音依旧是那种高而柔和的单调，仿佛她所说的事情并不出奇。仿佛明日香生命中的一周并没有消失。

Five days. Asuka wracks her brain attempting to remember what might've happened, where she might've been. Nothing comes to mind but an overwhelming bleakness spilling forth like so much black water into her every thought. It bubbles up from the hole inside her heart she's yet to fill.  
五天了。明日香绞尽脑汁试图回忆起可能发生的事情，她可能去过的地方。然而，除了如黑水般汹涌而来的无尽阴郁，她的脑海中一片空白。这股阴郁从她心中尚未填补的空洞中涌出，渗透进她的每一个思绪。

"Where?" she searches for, "Who?". Her voice is raspy from disuse, sharp like a crack in a column of ice.  
她在寻找，"哪里？""谁？"她的声音因久未使用而沙哑，尖锐得如同冰柱上的裂痕。

"There was a search. A lot of people helped. I don't know where you were for most of the time, but I found you up on the platform above the stage." Rei pauses, seems, for once, like she won't just say what is on her mind. Rei is beside her; Asuka doesn't look at her face. It's difficult to imagine that the decision being made has any bearing on Rei's expression, "You were cold, and you were dirty, and it frightened me. I took you here. It was all I could do."  
我们进行了一次搜寻。很多人帮忙了。我不知道你大部分时间在哪里，但我发现你在舞台上方的高台上。"零停顿了一下，似乎这一次她不会直接说出心里所想。零就在她身边；明日香没有看她的脸。很难想象这个决定与零的表情有任何关联，"你很冷，身上很脏，这让我很害怕。我把你带到了这里。这是我唯一能做的。

Rei stops talking. Lifts a small blue bucket she'd filled with water and dumps it with great care onto Asuka's head. The soap and the tears are washed away together, indistinguishable from one another.  
绫波停止了说话。她举起一个装满水的小蓝桶，小心翼翼地将其倾倒在明日香头上。肥皂和泪水一同被冲走，彼此难以区分。

"I don't remember what happened. So don't ask."  
“我不记得发生了什么。所以别问。”

And it's true. She has no recollection, only a dull throbbing pain emanating from her core and a headache like she's been dehydrated for days - which might have been true.  
这是真的。她没有任何记忆，只有从身体核心传来的隐隐作痛和仿佛几天未曾饮水般的头痛——这可能确实是真的。

Rei stays quiet, barely a nod. There isn't a window in the bathroom, but Asuka can feel that it is night in the same way eyeless insects can. She has just returned to the bright day of consciousness but she wants to sleep more than anything. To sleep until there is something worth waking up for.  
绫波沉默着，只是微微点头。浴室里没有窗户，但明日香能感觉到外面已是夜晚，就像无眼的昆虫一样。她刚从清醒的明亮日子中回来，却比什么都想睡觉。想一直睡到有值得醒来的事情发生。

Asuka doesn't notice the next step until Rei has lifted one of her arms out of the water and runs a soaped washcloth up and down its length, passing close to the side of her breast with each movement. Suddenly everything is on fire; her face heats up, her chest glows red in embarrassment. There's an uncontrollable twitch in her lower body that jolts her into a hyper-awareness like nothing before.  
直到绫波从水中抬起她的一只手臂，用肥皂泡洗布上下擦拭，每次动作都紧贴着她的乳房边缘，明日香才注意到下一步。突然间，一切都像着了火；她的脸颊发烫，胸口因羞愧而泛红。她的下身不由自主地抽搐，将她猛地拉入一种前所未有的极度警觉状态。

"What - what do you think you're doing?!"  
“你——你以为你在做什么？！”

"You needed help." Rei answers. If Asuka looks close enough she can see a blush somewhere beneath Rei's pale moon skin. Putting on her most wretched glare, she grabs for the washcloth. She falls short of it; her body is uncooperative, as if her muscles are receiving their orders seconds late. Asuka tries again, quits once more when the stitches in her side pull. It's a pity, she thinks, that she can somehow fall further, that there isn't a bottom or an end to her disappointment and shame. The image of an endless well is almost too cliché, she thinks - rather, she feels like a sinkhole collapsing in on itself, caving in from the sides, degrading into the indeterminate center of a black void.  
"你需要帮助。" 绫波回答道。如果明日香仔细看，她能从绫波苍白的月色肌肤下捕捉到一丝红晕。明日香摆出最凶狠的瞪视，伸手去抓毛巾。她没能抓到；身体不听使唤，仿佛肌肉接收指令总是慢了几秒。明日香再次尝试，却在侧腹的缝线拉扯下再次放弃。她觉得遗憾，自己竟还能跌得更深，似乎失望与羞耻没有尽头。无尽的深井形象太过陈词滥调，她想——不，她感觉自己更像是一个正在塌陷的沉洞，从四周崩塌，沦陷进一个无法界定的黑暗虚空中心。

Biting back the worse insults that come to mind, she lets Rei wash her. There is nothing left to her pride anymore, that stripped corpse. Rei has seen - Gendo has seen - the whole school has seen her failure unheeded. Rei had, it appears, carried her here in the first place, stripped her, filled this tub and set her in it. Asuka has nothing left to hide, because she has nothing left to protect anymore.  
她咬紧牙关，忍住涌上心头的恶毒咒骂，任由绫波为她清洗。她的自尊已荡然无存，那被剥光的尸体。绫波见过——源渡见过——全校都目睹了她失败的漠视。看来，正是绫波最初将她带到这里，脱去她的衣物，注满浴缸并安置她进去。明日香已无秘密可藏，因为她已无任何需要守护的东西。

The other girl is surprisingly gentle, though still brusque and appropriately prudish where it counts. Asuka appreciates that even if she won't say it. A small part of Asuka is comforted; the softness of Rei's hands, the kindness in her simple domestic task - there are emotions stirring up in Asuka that might've otherwise been battered and barred were she not half-crazed as it is.  
另一个女孩出乎意料地温柔，尽管在关键时候依然直率而恰当地保守。明日香对此心存感激，即便她不会说出口。明日香内心的一小部分感到安慰；绫波的手柔软，她在简单家务中的善意——这些情感在明日香心中涌动，如果不是她现在半疯的状态，这些情感可能早已被击碎并封锁。

Rei is scrubbing her back in soothing circles when she says, near to Asuka's ear, "I saw you in Germany. A few years back."  
绫波正在用舒缓的圆周运动擦洗她的背部时，靠近明日香的耳朵说：“我在德国见过你。几年前。”

Asuka's spine goes ridged as steel. She doesn't speak.  
明日香的脊背顿时僵硬如钢。她没有说话。

"My father had a student who played in the same exhibition. I don't know if you remember anyone else who was there. Father remembers you, though. And so do I."  
"我父亲有一个学生在同一个展览上演奏。我不知道你是否还记得其他在场的人。父亲记得你，我也记得。"

"So everything was set against me from the start?" she spits, "There was never a chance I was getting into Tokyo-3?"  
"所以从一开始一切就都对我不利吗？" 她愤愤地说，"我根本就没有机会进入第三新东京市吗？"

Rei says nothing. It's not guilt or shame that flits across her face, but pity. Maybe for Asuka. Maybe for herself.  
绫波没有说话。她脸上的表情不是内疚或羞愧，而是怜悯。或许是对明日香，或许是对她自己。

"And you didn't say anything. Not on that line, months ago. Not when we were made roommates."  
"而你什么也没说。不是在几个月前的那条线上，也不是在我们成为室友的时候。"

"You did not speak to me for most of that time. And Father - he told me not to say anything. I am not used to disobeying him."  
"那段时间你大部分时间都不跟我说话。而且父亲——他告诉我不要说任何事。我不习惯违抗他。"

"That doesn't change anything! You knew - you knew, and your father knew, and I bet even Shinji knew. I've been a joke to you. Some private joke you all laughed at."  
"这改变不了什么！你明明知道——你、你父亲，甚至我敢打赌连真嗣都知道。我在你们眼里就是个笑话。你们私下里嘲笑的笑话。"

Asuka tries to rise up from the tub but her strength and control are still gone. She slips, knocks her elbows against the solid lip of the tub, and flinches in pain. It's all been too much, all of the emotional turmoil in the past few minutes. In the past few years. She settles down, the exhaustion she'd almost forgotten exacting its revenge. It's easier to turn away from Rei than to look her in the eyes. "You make me sick."  
明日香试图从浴缸中站起来，但她的力量和控制力仍未恢复。她滑了一下，手肘撞到了坚硬的浴缸边缘，痛得一缩。这一切都太过沉重，过去几分钟乃至几年的情感动荡。她沉了下去，那份几乎被遗忘的疲惫开始报复。比起直视绫波，转过身去更容易些。“你让我恶心。”

"I was impressed when I saw you in Germany," Rei says after a pause. "Not impressed. Inspired. You had so much confidence. You felt everything. And so strongly. I admired you for it then, and I still do now."  
“我在德国见到你时，感到很震撼，”绫波停顿了一下后说，“不是震撼，是启发。你充满了自信，你感受一切，而且那么强烈。我当时就因此敬佩你，现在依然如此。”

"But you let this happen to me anyway, didn't you?"  
“但你还是让我遭遇了这一切，不是吗？”

"If I offered the help, would you have accepted it?"  
"如果我提出帮助，你会接受吗？"

---

Asuka had been right earlier. The deep black night sky flattens the view from the windows in the dormitory buildings. There isn't a horizon without light, a lack of a future in the darkness. She stumbles, pushing along the wall like it is a friend offering a hand in her time of need. But she has none - no friends, not any more. She didn't really have any to begin with, she thinks. Rei's steps behind her are uncertain, as if she'd like to reach out but fears being bitten. The inevitability of a futile task weighs Asuka down, lead-bellied, as she heads towards their shared space, the room she and Rei stay in together. Even her body is letting her down. She knows she can't make it out tonight or she'd be heading the other way, out the door and away from the school forever.  
明日香之前说得没错。深邃的夜空将宿舍楼窗户外的景色压得扁平。没有光线的地平线，黑暗中缺乏未来。她踉跄着，沿着墙壁推移，仿佛墙壁是她在需要时伸出援手的朋友。但她没有——没有朋友，不再有了。她想，她本来就没有真正拥有过朋友。绫波丽的脚步跟在她后面，显得犹豫不决，好像她想伸手却又害怕被咬。徒劳任务的必然性压得明日香喘不过气来，她拖着沉重的步伐走向她们共用的空间，她和绫波丽同住的房间。连她的身体都在背叛她。她知道自己今晚无法逃离，否则她会朝着另一个方向，走出校门，永远离开这个地方。

Agonizing is hardly enough to describe the length of time it takes to get to their room. Asuka drags herself in, collapses face first onto her mattress and ignores the throb it sets off in her nose. Half her body is still hanging off the bed, and her knees scrape across the scratchy carpeting. She barely feels any of it, and none of it more than the pressure emanating from Rei's presence.  
用'痛苦'来形容走到她们房间所花费的时间，简直太轻描淡写了。明日香拖着身子进去，脸朝下倒在床垫上，无视了由此引发的鼻子的阵阵疼痛。她的半个身子还悬在床外，膝盖在粗糙的地毯上摩擦。她几乎感觉不到这些，更不用说来自绫波存在感的压迫了。

"I didn't tell anyone that I found you yet." she hears Rei cross the room, lean over her body, and then - Asuka's heart stops - tuck the doll from its place beside the wall into the crook between Asuka's shoulder and neck. "You should get some rest before I tell them in the morning. I cannot imagine that you will have a lot of time to yourself tomorrow."  
“我还没告诉任何人我找到了你。”她听到绫波穿过房间，俯身在她身上，然后——明日香的心跳停了一拍——把原本靠墙放着的玩偶塞进了明日香肩膀和颈部的空隙中。“在我明早告诉他们之前，你应该先休息一下。我想你明天不会有太多属于自己的时间。”

_Kill them with kindness_ - it's a phrase Asuka has heard before, one she's never believed. She preferred, always, to take out anyone who would stand in her way with skill and strength. Direct conquest, immediate consummation. So it's a shock that she cannot, in the end, handle Rei's killing blow here. That her heart is torn from her chest, bloody, still beating, from behind, and held out to her gently in Rei's hand.  
以善意击败他们——这是明日香以前听过的一句话，但她从未相信过。她总是更喜欢用技巧和力量直接征服任何挡在她路上的人。直接征服，立即实现。因此，她最终无法应对绫波的致命一击，这让她感到震惊。她的心脏被从胸腔中撕扯出来，血淋淋的，仍在跳动，从背后被温柔地放在绫波的手中。

Were she not so dry, so utterly diminished, she might be on the verge of exasperated tears right now.  
若非她如此干涸，如此彻底地枯竭，她此刻或许已濒临气恼落泪的边缘。

"Who are you, Rei Ayanami? I just don't get it. You don't make any sense to me."  
你是谁，绫波丽？我就是搞不懂。你对我来说毫无意义。

Rei doesn't answer at first. Asuka feels the girl sit next to her, slide against the bed to the floor. She follows suit. Slides down the bed, sits with her knees pulled up to her chest and rests her cheek on the tops of her hands, facing Rei.  
"绫波起初没有回答。明日香感觉到女孩坐到她旁边，顺着床沿滑到地板上。她也跟着这么做，滑下床，坐下时将膝盖抱在胸前，脸颊靠在手背上，面向绫波。

Rei sighs, then begins. "I am no one. Father sees me as my mother, when he doesn't see me as a tool. You have seen me in class; I am invisible, to everybody." She offers Asuka an almost wry smile, the most nuanced expression Asuka's ever seen on her face. "But not you. You hate me, Asuka. You hate _me_. That has been enough, I think."  
绫波叹了口气，然后开始说道：“我谁也不是。父亲看我时，要么将我视为母亲，要么视我为工具。你在课堂上见过我；我对所有人来说都是隐形的。”她向明日香露出一个几乎带着自嘲的微笑，这是明日香在她脸上见过的最复杂的表情。“但你不同。你恨我，明日香。你恨我。我想，这已经足够了。”

Simplicity is often over-explored. The simplest things in life are already the most treasured, the simplest explanations the best understood. Asuka's tongue feels almost numb in trying to find the words to tell Rei that her explanation is too simple. That it doesn't fit in with Asuka's own world-view, where hate is hate and attention is the highest goal, and a personality - a self - is the only truth one can rely on.  
简单性常常被过度探究。生活中最简单的事物本就是最珍贵的，最简单的解释最容易理解。明日香试图找到词语告诉绫波，她的解释太过简单。这与明日香自己的世界观不符，在那里，恨就是恨，注意力是最高目标，而个性——自我——是唯一可以依赖的真理。

"I've slapped you, Rei. I've called you names. Have you never been angry? Upset? This is - are you _human_?"  
“我打过你，绫波。我辱骂过你。你从未感到愤怒吗？难过吗？这——你是人类吗？”

"That's exactly it. It was not until you, Asuka, that anyone has even tried to make me feel those ways. You've hurt me. You've also made me happy. You've allowed me to make my own decisions in how to treat you. How to react."  
"正是如此。直到你，明日香，才有人试图让我感受到这些。你伤害了我。你也让我快乐。你让我自己决定如何对待你，如何反应。"

Asuka shakes her head, her eyes all but closed. She is so tired, so utterly tired, that all she can think of now is how to get Rei to stop talking. She can't think anymore. Feeling is even worse; like overusing a muscle, or straining your eyes.  
明日香摇了摇头，眼睛几乎闭上了。她太累了，累到极点，现在她只想让绫波丽停止说话。她无法思考了。感受更糟；就像过度使用肌肉，或是过度疲劳的眼睛。

Rei continues. "Father - he wanted to pull me out of this school. I denied him that."  
绫波继续说道：“父亲——他想让我退学。我拒绝了他。”

Asuka only shakes her head. "I don't want to hear any more. I have to sleep." She pulls herself up, slowly, her joints creaking like old hinges, and Rei, watching her warily, follows. One of Asuka's hands holds her doll. The other, without thought, grabs for Rei's. Asuka collapses on her bed.  
明日香只是摇了摇头。“我不想再听了。我得睡觉了。”她慢慢起身，关节吱嘎作响，像老旧的铰链，而绫波，警惕地看着她，也跟着起身。明日香的一只手抓着她的玩偶。另一只手，无意识地，抓住了绫波的手。明日香倒在床上。

"Come, if you're coming." She says.  
“来吧，要来就快点。”她说道。

It is a moment later when Rei slides, hesitantly, behind Asuka. She lays on her back stiff and awkward until Asuka pulls, with the last of her energy, the other girl onto her side so that Rei is curled around her. Spoons her. Rei is physically smaller but tonight is the 'big spoon', with an arm draped around Asuka's chest. She's too warm, her bony knees are awkwardly poking the back of Asuka's thighs, but it all feels right. Proper. The fulfillment of desires she never wanted to have.  
过了一会儿，绫波犹豫地滑到明日香身后。她僵硬而尴尬地仰面躺着，直到明日香用尽最后一点力气，把另一个女孩拉到自己身边，让绫波蜷缩在她周围。像勺子一样拥抱着她。绫波身体较小，但今晚她是‘大勺子’，一只手臂搭在明日香的胸前。她太热了，瘦骨嶙峋的膝盖尴尬地顶着明日香大腿的后侧，但这一切感觉都是对的。恰当的。实现了她从未想要拥有的渴望。

Asuka's heart burns like it's been stripped raw. This will be the best night of sleep she will have had in a long time.  
明日香的内心如同被剥去外壳般燃烧。这将是她许久以来睡得最好的一晚。

**Part 13 第 13 部分**

This is the second time she has woken up beside her roommate. The light of the morning is harsh, slanting in the bright valley between the bottom of the blinds and the top of the sill. Her head is pounding; it feels like it must've been doing so even as she slept. Like she received unconscious notifications of pain that popped up unceasingly upon waking. She is still curled up, hugging her doll to her chest, and as she returns to the waking world she's grows aware of Rei behind her. Of knees pushed into her thighs, breasts pressed against her back, a face buried in the hair falling over the nape of her neck. Warmth, human warmth like she's never felt it before. She lies there, unsure if this is a horrible nightmare or the birth of some brand new dream. She practices moving her body, stretches her arms high, flexes her digits, extends her legs. She doesn't exactly care if Rei is woken by her movements, but refuses a cathartic moan anyway. Still, she watches one of Rei's bright red eyes opens a crack.  
这是她第二次在室友身边醒来。晨光刺眼，斜斜地洒在百叶窗底部与窗台顶部的明亮缝隙间。她的头剧烈疼痛，仿佛即使在睡梦中也未曾停歇。就像她收到了无意识的疼痛通知，醒来后仍不断弹出。她依旧蜷缩着，怀中紧抱着玩偶，当她逐渐回到清醒的世界时，她开始意识到身后的绫波。膝盖顶在她的腿上，胸部紧贴着她的背，脸埋在她颈后垂下的发丝中。温暖，一种她从未感受过的人类温暖。她躺在那里，不确定这是否是一场可怕的噩梦，还是某个全新梦境的诞生。她练习移动身体，高高伸展双臂，弯曲手指，伸直双腿。她并不特别在意自己的动作是否会吵醒绫波，但仍然拒绝发出宣泄的呻吟。尽管如此，她还是看到绫波那只明亮的红眼睛微微睁开了一条缝。

"Let's get this over with." Asuka says. Rei gazes at her unquestioningly.  
“让我们快点结束这一切。”明日香说道。绫波无言地凝视着她。

"I'll go and tell Kaji you're back."  
“我会去告诉加持你回来了。”

"I'm going too. You'll only be sent back here to get me anyway."  
"我也要去。反正你最后还得回来接我。"

---

One meeting with the police, one long, thorough exam by the school nurse, and a grueling discussion with her government case worker later, Asuka is guided to her final talk by one of the headmaster's aides, a young man with shorn hair named Hyuga. She's sick of speaking. Tired of all of the interrogations. She thought that being at this school was punishment enough, but if she has to be lectured at one more time she will poke holes in her own eardrums. Her body might as well weigh a ton; she is all but dragging herself through the halls following Hyuga. Rei is a silent soldier beside her.  
一次与警方的会面，一次学校护士的长时间彻底检查，以及与她的政府案件工作人员的一场艰苦讨论之后，明日香被一位名叫日向的年轻男子引导至最终谈话，他是校长的助手，头发剪得很短。她已经厌倦了说话。厌倦了所有的审问。她本以为在这所学校就已经是惩罚了，但如果再被训斥一次，她宁愿刺穿自己的耳膜。她的身体仿佛重达千斤；她几乎是拖着自己在走廊上跟着日向走。绫波则是她身旁沉默的士兵。

It's awful to admit how much she needs that.  
承认自己有多需要这个，真是糟糕透了。

Rei had been at her side all day, filling in the time between the failure of the search-and-rescue team and the missing spaces in Asuaka's memory about when she was found. Celebrated as a savior, the compliments and praises bounce off of Rei's purposeful bluntness. What a difference it was, having someone to support her, someone in her corner. Asuka's chest spent the day buzzing and vibrating, her heart beating harder whenever Rei answered something, or gave her a meaningful glance in the midst of these questionings. She wouldn't accept the obvious reason for this. Even after the previous night...it was too empty of a world if the only person she could trust didn't think of herself as a person in the first place.  
一整天，绫波都在她身边，填补着搜救队失败与明日香记忆中被发现时的空白间隙。被誉为救世主，那些赞美与恭维却因绫波刻意的直率而无法触及其心。有人支持，有人站在她这边，这是多么大的不同。明日香的胸口整日嗡嗡作响，每当绫波回答问题或在这些询问中投来意味深长的一瞥时，她的心跳就会加速。她不愿接受这显而易见的原因。即使在前一晚之后...如果唯一能信任的人从一开始就不认为自己是个人，这个世界就太空洞了。

They follow Hyuga into a small office with a sign reading counselor on a plaque beside the door. It's a messy room, especially considering that it's a professional office, and Asuka scoffs as she walks in.  
他们跟随日向进入一个挂着“辅导员”牌子的小办公室。房间凌乱不堪，尤其考虑到这是一间专业办公室，明日香走进去时嗤之以鼻。

"What a sty," she rolls her eyes.  
“真是个猪窝，”她翻了个白眼。

The desk is strewn with odds and ends, the floor dotted with any number of tissues and paper balls that avoided their fate ending in the trashcan. Hanging on the coat rack were shorts and pants layered like tree boughs. There's a miasma so thick it is almost visible, a familiar scent, some perfume or fragrance someone sprayed out of a hose rather than spritzed, and then topped with cigarette smoke. She wrinkles her nose. There doesn't seem to be anyone in the office, though Asuka can't be sure that there isn't someone hiding behind that coat hanger, or between the messy stacks by the bookshelf.  
桌上零乱地堆满了杂物，地板上散落着无数逃过垃圾桶命运的纸巾和纸团。衣帽架上挂着的短裤和长裤层层叠叠，宛如树枝。空气中弥漫着一股浓得几乎可见的熟悉气味，像是有人用软管而非喷雾器喷洒的香水或香氛，再混杂着香烟的烟雾。她皱了皱鼻子。办公室里似乎没人，但明日香不能确定是否有人藏在衣帽架后，或是书架旁杂乱的堆放物之间。

Hyuga scratches his head, the look of an exasperated parent aging him in spite of his apparent youth. "Geeze, always late, isn't she? I'll go find her. You two wait here."  
日向挠了挠头，那副无奈家长的表情让他显得比实际年龄更老成。“哎，总是迟到，不是吗？我去找她。你们俩在这儿等着。”

With little better to do, Asuka plops down in the uncomfortable plastic chair in front of the desk; Rei follows suit, a three-dimensional shadow whose coordination is slowed in the viscous flow of time. More uncomfortable than the chairs is the silence stretched out between them.  
无所事事之下，明日香一屁股坐在了办公桌前那张不舒服的塑料椅上；绫波也跟着坐下，如同一个在粘稠时间流中动作迟缓的三维影子。比椅子更让人难受的是他们之间拉长的沉默。

"I can't wait for this to be over." Asuka grumbles, crossing her arms over her chest. It's said at, and not necessarily to, Rei, but the other girl answers.  
"我真是迫不及待想结束这一切。" 明日香嘟囔着，双臂交叉抱在胸前。这话虽是对着零说，并非特意向她发问，但零还是回应了。

"Have you decided what you're going to do now?"  
"你现在决定好要做什么了吗？"

"That's a good question." the voice comes from behind them - young, laced with the remnants of a dying yawn. "Exactly what I was going to ask."  
"这真是个好问题。" 声音从她们身后传来——年轻，带着刚消散的哈欠余韵。"正是我想问的。"

Asuka turns to the voice to see a woman with long, dark purple hair standing in the doorway. She's wearing a black cocktail dress beneath a shortened red leather jacket, neither article all that appropriate in a school. There's something familiar about her face and hair, that particular shade of purple, and when Rei offers the woman a small nod, it all clicks into place.  
明日香转向声音的方向，看到一位长发深紫色的女性站在门口。她穿着一件黑色鸡尾酒裙，外面是一件缩短的红色皮夹克，这两件衣物在学校里都不太合适。她的面容和发色，那种特别的紫色，有些熟悉，当绫波向这位女士微微点头时，一切豁然开朗。

"You! You were at Tokyo-3 too." Whatever weakness had stuck around from the day before burns away in the flames of her exasperation and outrage. Everyone - it seems like everyone has been in on the joke that has been her life ever since she'd auditioned for a spot at the Tokyo-3 Conservatory.  
“你！你也在第三新东京市。”无论前一天残留的任何虚弱，都在她愤怒和愤慨的火焰中燃烧殆尽。似乎每个人——自从她为第三新东京市音乐学院的席位试镜以来，每个人都在她生活的笑话中有所参与。

"Oh, you remembered! Misato Katsuragi, that's me! Yeah, they - uh let me go. Conductor Ikari isn't the easiest guy to work with." Misato shrugs her shoulder at Rei with a light grimace. "No offense."  
“哦，你还记得！我是葛城美里！是的，他们——呃，让我走了。碇源堂指挥可不是个容易相处的人。”美里向绫波耸了耸肩，带着一丝苦笑。“无意冒犯。”

"None taken." "没在意。"

"Anyway, Ryoji wanted me to talk with you about what happened."  
"总之，Ryoji 希望我和你谈谈发生的事情。"

At the mention of Kaji the familiar scent, that heavy perfume, thick with lavender and cloyingly sweet, is made more clear - on more than one occasion Kaji had smelled like that, clearly not his actual choice of a fragrance, and though she had no hard evidence, Asuka was sure that the two adults had something going on between them. Another joke. She's getting sick of it now, of conspiracies and secrets, of the hidden threads of some unseen net pulling everything around her into a mass of amalgamated bodies.  
一提到 Kaji，那熟悉的香气，那种浓郁的香水味，混合着薰衣草和过于甜腻的气息，变得更加清晰——不止一次，Kaji 身上就有这种味道，显然不是他自己选择的香水，尽管 Asuka 没有确凿证据，但她确信这两位成年人之间一定有什么不可告人的关系。又是一个笑话。她现在对这些阴谋和秘密感到厌倦，对那些看不见的网线将她周围的一切拉扯成一团混杂的躯体感到厌烦。

"You all saw what happened."  
"你们都看到了发生了什么。"

"Why is the question. Not what."  
"为什么是关键，不是什么。"

"It's not a secret." she scowls, "I'm the best musician in this place, but I'm being forced - _tricked_ - into giving up the thing that makes me better. And look at what it's done! I'm making mistakes! I can't even play right anymore! I might as well just be some nobody out on the street."  
"这又不是秘密。" 她皱眉说道，"我是这里最出色的音乐家，但我却被迫——被骗——放弃让我更出色的东西。看看这都带来了什么！我开始犯错了！我甚至都不能正常演奏了！我简直就像街上的无名小卒一样。"

She'd stood up somewhere in the midst of her tirade, fists shaking at her sides, but she doesn't notice until Rei's hand - cool and calm and sturdy - is wrapped around her wrist. She stops speaking, glares at the hand like it's a creature she only just discovered, and is unsure about whether or not it's dangerous. She doesn't shake it off.  
她在怒斥中不知何时站了起来，双拳紧握在身侧颤抖，直到绫的手——冰凉、镇定而有力——握住她的手腕，她才意识到。她停止了说话，瞪着那只手，仿佛它是刚刚发现的生物，不确定它是否危险。她没有甩开它。

Asuka continues, "I want out. If I can't play the way I want, then there's no point. I'll make it on my own."  
明日香继续说道：“我要退出。如果我不能按自己的方式玩，那就没有意义了。我会靠自己成功的。”

The hand on her wrist goes slack and falls away like cut rope, heavy and useless. Asuka draws in a quick breath. It's surprising how a heart can so suddenly feel pricked and barbed from the smallest actions. It's like the world is made of razor wind and pointed rocks. Asuka steels herself. She can't feel bad; she can't feel anything towards the girl beside her, not if it comes at the cost of her future.  
握在她手腕上的手松开了，像被割断的绳子一样沉重而无用地垂下。明日香深吸一口气。令人惊讶的是，心脏竟能因最微小的动作而突然感到刺痛和扎痛。这世界仿佛由锋利的寒风和尖锐的岩石构成。明日香坚定自己。她不能感到难过；她不能对身边的女孩有任何感觉，如果这要以她的未来为代价。

Misato quirks an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed by the impassioned speech. "So that's it? You're just going to quit? Run away?"  
碇真嗣挑起一边眉毛，显然对这番激昂的演讲不为所动。“就这样？你打算放弃？逃跑？”

"It's not - it's not running away! It's setting off on my own, it's - "  
“这不是——这不是逃跑！这是我自己出发，这是——”

"It's being weak, Asuka." Misato cuts in. The suddenly hard edge to her voice doesn't sound like it belongs there, like she's putting it on, but then, Asuka doesn't actually know this woman. She feels trapped, and it's only a fear of just how much better she actually is compared to how she feels that stops her from turning and running right out of the room.  
“这是软弱，明日香。”碇真嗣打断道。她声音中突然出现的严厉边缘听起来并不自然，仿佛是装出来的，但话说回来，明日香其实并不了解这个女人。她感到被困住了，正是出于对自己实际能力与感受之间差距的恐惧，才阻止了她转身跑出房间。

And if she did, she would have run into Kaji. The man grunts, leaning on the door frame in that overly casual way of his, arms crossed, stubble still at a too-perfect level. Asuka glares at him too - she's had enough of trying to be good, of trying to get on his good side. She's sure it's already too late anyway.  
倘若她真的这么做了，肯定会撞见加持。那个男人哼了一声，以他那种过于随意的方式倚在门框上，双臂交叉，胡茬依旧保持着过分完美的程度。明日香也瞪着他——她已经受够了试图表现得乖巧，试图讨他欢心。她确信，无论如何都已经太迟了。

"I wonder," he begins, scratching at his chin, "if you aren't just afraid that if you take our advice on how you play, you might find that you really can play better. Wouldn't that mean that, up til now, you haven't been playing your best?"  
我在想，"他开始说道，挠了挠下巴，"你是否只是害怕，如果我们给你的游戏建议你采纳了，你可能会发现你真的能玩得更好。那岂不是意味着，直到现在，你都没有发挥出最佳水平？

The words hurt like being pelted with ice, cold and bruising, clear enough to see that they are what they are. She glares at the messy floor. Not a word comes to her tongue, not a sound flutters up her throat. Those words weren't the truth when she could write them off as her own delusions. Ignore them, the way she ignores other genuine emotions to undercut them instead with manufactured anger and discontent. But hearing them out loud, seeing that she, in fact, could hide nothing from these people - that she was little more than an actress among them, rather than a musician - it silences Asuka. Removes any trace of confidence or the chance of escaping from this awful situation gracefully.  
那些话语如同被冰雹击中，寒冷而刺痛，清晰到足以看清它们的本质。她怒视着凌乱的地面。没有一句话能从她口中说出，没有一丝声音能从她喉咙升起。当她还能将这些话视为自己的妄想时，它们并非真相。像她忽视其他真实的情感一样，她选择用制造出的愤怒和不满足来削弱它们。但当这些话被大声说出，看到自己实际上无法在这些人的面前隐藏任何东西——她不过是在他们中间的一个演员，而非音乐家——这让明日香沉默了。剥夺了她任何自信的痕迹，以及从这糟糕局面中优雅脱身的机会。

"Thank you, but I think I have this handled." Misato points at Kaji, who shrugs.  
“谢谢，但我想我能处理好。” 葛城指向加持，后者耸了耸肩。

"I'm just here for moral support." He quips. He takes a cigarette out of the pack in the pocket of his shirt before sighing, remembering where he is. "Rei," he says, placing the thing back in the box. "What do you think of all this?"  
"“我只是来提供精神支持的。” 他打趣道。他从衬衫口袋里拿出烟盒，正要取出一支烟，却又叹了口气，意识到自己身处何地。“绫波，” 他说着，将烟放回盒中，“你对这一切怎么看？”

Rei folds her hands in her lap, seems to contemplate their folds and faults. Her lack of an answer creates a vacuum in the room, drawing attention into the void of wordlessness. Asuka's heart beats against her ribcage like a prisoner slamming his hand on plate glass. She wants to know the answer. In that moment she has never wanted anything more.  
绫波将双手叠放在膝上，似乎在沉思着那些褶皱与瑕疵。她没有回答，使得房间内形成了一片真空，吸引着注意力陷入这片无言的空洞。明日香的心脏撞击着肋骨，如同囚犯猛击着钢化玻璃。她渴望知道答案。那一刻，她从未如此渴望过任何事物。

"I believe that Asuka ought to do what she thinks is best for herself."  
"我相信明日香应该做她认为对自己最好的事情。"

"You're an idiot, Ayanami. " Asuka shakes her head. She doesn't know what she was hoping for, but immediately knows that that wasn't it. Maybe she was hoping for direction. Maybe she was hoping to be saved.  
"你真是个傻瓜，绫波。" 明日香摇了摇头。她不知道自己原本期待什么，但立刻明白那并非她所愿。或许她期待的是指引，或许她期待的是被拯救。

"I'm leaving. I don't need this place. I'll make it on my own." she glares at each of the other people in turn unflinchingly, then leaves the room and tries to leave her feelings behind too.  
"我要走了。我不需要这个地方。我会靠自己成功的。" 她毫不退缩地一一瞪视着其他人，然后离开房间，试图也将自己的情感抛在身后。

---

Asuka knows her own scent now. Normally it is one of those particular parts of your own chemistry that is unknowable, except in those times when you return to old, familiar places - places that were once yours - homes and cars, bedrooms - when what hits you, before nostalgia and homesickness, is the particular scent you carry around. An identifier. An aspect of yourself. A secret.  
明日香现在熟悉了自己的气味。通常，这是你自身化学成分中那些无法知晓的部分之一，除非在回到旧日熟悉之地的时候——那些曾经属于你的地方——家、车、卧室——当什么东西先于怀旧和思乡之情击中你时，是你所携带的特定气味。一个标识符。你自己的一个方面。一个秘密。

But she knows it now, because it is the lingering scent beneath what she knows to be Rei's. That almost sterile, aquatic thing of lavender and silver water and the pale light of the moon. And Rei is there, all over Asuka's pillow, under her blanket, coating the thin sheets she's rolling up into a ball to throw into that box at the foot of her bed, the one she never finished unpacking as if she knew the whole time that she'd leave, that this school would be a temporary place. The scent is in her own hair, it's all over her own clothing. She didn't want to find out her own this way. She didn't want to remember Rei through any of this.  
但她现在知道了，因为那是她所熟悉的丽的味道之下的余韵。那种几乎无菌的、水生植物的气息，混合着薰衣草、银色水波和月光淡淡的辉光。丽就在那里，遍布在明日香的枕头上，藏在她的毯子下，覆盖着她卷成一团准备扔进床脚那个箱子的薄床单，那个她从未完成整理的箱子，仿佛她一直都知道自己会离开，知道这所学校只是一个暂时的落脚点。这气味也渗透在她自己的头发里，遍布在她的衣物上。她本不想以这种方式发现自己的感受。她本不想通过这一切来回忆丽。

Asuka leaves her school uniforms lying on her bed like starch-white snake skins. The teal skirts are unflattering and wide. She wouldn't need them anymore, never liked them in the first place. She feels more like herself as she steps into a pair of tight navy-dark jeans and dons a cherry-red track jacket. Shedding this cursed place with every action. Shedding herself, the self stained by the walls and the mildew scent and the stares. Shedding Rei.  
明日香将自己的校服随意丢弃在床上，宛如僵硬的白色蛇蜕。那青绿色的裙子既不讨喜又宽大。她再也不需要它们了，一开始就不喜欢。当她穿上一条紧身的深海军蓝牛仔裤，套上一件樱桃红的运动夹克时，她感觉更像自己了。每做一个动作，都在摆脱这个被诅咒的地方。摆脱自己，那个被墙壁、霉味和目光所玷污的自己。摆脱丽。

Rei hadn't moved after Asuka declared her plan. She is likely still sitting in that chair now, staring dumbly at her own hands as if they ever had the power to do anything at all. Asuka bets that Misato and Kaji are laughing, glad to be rid of her. Well, whatever. She's taking her genius with her.  
在明日香宣布了她的计划后，绫波没有移动过。她现在很可能还坐在那把椅子上，呆呆地盯着自己的双手，仿佛它们真的拥有过什么力量似的。明日香敢打赌，美里和加持一定在笑，庆幸摆脱了她。算了，无所谓。她要把自己的天才一并带走。

Asuka packs her doll last. Places it at the top of the pile in the box, and she watches the light reflected from the window fade away out of those black button eyes as she closes the box's flap and seals it with tape.  
明日香最后打包的是她的玩偶。她将其放在箱子顶层，然后注视着从窗户反射的光线在那些黑色纽扣眼睛中逐渐消失，随着她合上箱盖并用胶带封好。

"Asuka." "明日香。"

Rei's voice come from the doorway, that same-old soft pitch without its steadiness, wavering like tassels. A twitch in Asuka's stomach wants her to answer. She doesn't. She checks the wardrobe that had once separated their halves of the room for anything she might have left.  
绫波的声音从门口传来，依旧是那种柔和的音调，失去了往日的稳定，像流苏一样摇摆不定。明日香的胃里一阵抽搐，想要回应。但她没有。她检查了曾经将房间一分为二的衣柜，看是否有东西遗漏。

"Asuka." "明日香。"

The voice is closer now. Not directly behind her - Rei has always had the good sense not to get too close when Asuka is angry, the proper instinct that Asuka's an animal with a biting maw and ready talons. She's closer, though. Asuka can feel her presence, the one that, not so long before, she didn't even think existed. She still does not answer. Slams the wardrobe doors shut, flicks her hair out and knocks against Rei's shoulder on her way to leave the room.  
那声音现在更近了。并非紧跟在她身后——绫波总是有足够的理智，不会在明日香生气时靠得太近，本能地知道明日香就像一只张着利齿、随时准备抓挠的野兽。但她确实更近了。明日香能感觉到她的存在，那个不久前她甚至不认为存在的人。她依旧没有回应。砰地关上衣柜门，甩了甩头发，在离开房间的路上撞到了绫波的肩膀。

"_Asuka Langley Soryu_. Please, answer me."  
“明日香·兰格雷。请回答我。”

"What?! What, Rei? What do you want?"  
“什么？！什么，绫波？你想干嘛？”

"I want you to stay."  
"我想你留下。"

It wasn't what Asuka had been asking, but she's tossed nonetheless, like a battering ram impacted her ribcage. The sound of Rei's footsteps, the flat slap against the floor, are all she can hear before the soft pressure of Rei's hand settles itself on her shoulder.  
这并非明日香所求，但她仍被震撼，仿佛攻城槌撞击了她的胸腔。她只能听见绫波的脚步声，那平实的拍打地板的声音，随后是绫波手轻轻落在她肩上的触感。

"You don't mean that. You don't want anything. You're _nobody_, Rei, You said it yourself."  
"你不是真心的。你什么都不想要。你谁也不是，绫波，你自己说的。"

Rei's face twists up in hurt more openly than ever before. Her hand falters on Asuka's shoulder. It falters, but only for a moment. She adds her other hand to Asuka's other shoulder, pulls Asuka in closer. That scent is back now, overwhelming. She sees herself reflected back in the facets of Rei's ruby eyes. There's desperation there. She's unsure if it's hers or Rei's.  
绫波的表情比以往任何时候都更明显地扭曲着，透露出痛苦。她的手在明日香的肩上颤抖了一下。虽然只是短暂的一瞬，但她随即用另一只手搭在明日香的另一边肩膀上，将她拉得更近。那股香气再次袭来，强烈到令人窒息。她在绫波红宝石般的眼睛中看到了自己的倒影，那里充满了绝望。她不确定这绝望是自己的，还是绫波的。

"I _was_ nobody. Maybe I still am. But you have helped me to discover what I want, Asuka. And what I need."  
“我曾经什么都不是。或许现在依然如此。但是你帮助我发现了我想要什么，明日香。以及我需要什么。”

"No one needs me! Not my mother, not my father, not Tokyo-3, not this school - no one. So don't you lie to me, Rei"  
“没有人需要我！无论是我的母亲，还是我的父亲，无论是第三新东京市，还是这所学校——没有人。所以别对我撒谎，绫波。”

The tears come now, without her control and without her desire. She's burning up, gripping Rei's shoulders in the same way that Rei's gripping hers. Curls her fingers into the muscle and skin until she sees Rei flinch. She wants to show Rei all the pain that's been stuffed into her body. She wants to give it to Rei, to give it all away and find the _her_ that lies beneath it, a stranger even to herself.  
泪水此刻不受控制地涌出，非她所愿。她感到浑身灼热，紧抓着绫波的肩膀，正如绫波紧抓着她一样。她将手指深深嵌入绫波的肌肉与皮肤，直至看到绫波因疼痛而抽搐。她想向绫波展示体内积压的所有痛苦。她想将这一切痛苦传递给绫波，全部抛却，去寻找那个隐藏在痛苦之下的自己，那个连她自己都感到陌生的自己。

"I am the only thing I need." Asuka growls.  
“我只需要我自己。”明日香低吼道。

"I want you to need me too." Rei answers. She seems to be giving up, her arms losing their strength, and Asuka feels it, _fears_ it, because if this is all some lie, some trick... But Rei pulls her in close, presses her forehead against Asuka's, like a child leaning against a window to watch the snow.  
“我也希望你需要我。”绫波回答。她似乎在放弃，手臂的力量逐渐流失，明日香感受到了，也害怕了，因为如果这一切都是谎言，都是诡计……但绫波紧紧抱住她，将额头贴在明日香的额头上，就像一个孩子靠在窗边观看雪景那样。

There has always been a hole in Asuka's heart. She feels it in those moments when anger and discontent recedes, when the ocean of her own sadness escapes this hole. She feels it now pouring out at the edges, washing her voice down into the nothingness at her center where everything real in her lies.  
阿苏卡的心中一直有个空洞。每当愤怒与不满退去，当她内心的悲伤之海从这个空洞中溢出时，她便能感受到它。此刻，它正从边缘倾泻而出，将她的声音冲刷进中心的虚无之地，那里埋藏着她所有真实的自我。

"You're an awful liar, Rei."  
“你真是个糟糕的说谎者，零。”

"_I_ am correcting a lie right now. Do not do what you think you ought to. Do what _I_ want you to do."  
“我正在纠正一个谎言。不要做你认为自己应该做的，去做你想做的。”

Tremors run through Asuka's body like they're racing to her heart. She grips the side of Rei's face. Smashes her lips against Rei's, repeating a mistake she swore never to make again. And this time, Rei is not so passive. Her lips move against Asuka's with a desire that seemed impossible in Rei, and one that doesn't lie. Rei is delicious. She's never thought that about a person before but it's all she thinks now - the girl's lips are chapped and unevenly wet, and she's an amateur at this, but she tastes - she tastes like Rei ought to taste.  
震颤如赛跑般掠过明日香的身躯，直奔她的心脏。她紧抓着绫波的脸颊，猛地吻上绫波的唇，重复着她曾发誓绝不再犯的错误。而这一次，绫波不再被动。她的唇与明日香的唇交缠，带着一种在绫波身上看似不可能的渴望，且这渴望毫不虚假。绫波的味道令人陶醉。她从未对一个人有过这样的想法，但现在这成了她唯一的念头——那女孩的唇干裂且湿润不均，她对此生疏，但她的味道——她的味道正是绫波应有的味道。

They pull apart. Asuka, on instinct, licks her lips.  
她们分开。明日香本能地舔了舔嘴唇。

She drops her backpack to the floor.  
她将背包扔到地上。

She drops herself to the floor.  
她跌坐在地板上。

"Will you stay, Asuka?" “你会留下吗，明日香？”

Rei kneels down in front of the girl. Leaves breeze-light kisses on her forehead, on her cheeks, her ears, her nose. Her hands - the backs and the palms, her fingers, the fingertips each one at a time. They burn. Everywhere that Rei touches burns. Bright white, blinding, eating away at every inch of her. She can't think. She doesn't want to feel anymore. Her breathing is shallow, sharp. Sweet.  
绫波跪在女孩面前，轻如微风地吻在她的额头、脸颊、耳朵、鼻尖。她的双手——手背、手掌、手指，每一根指尖逐一触碰。所触之处，皆燃起炽热。那光芒耀眼夺目，吞噬着她的每一寸肌肤。她无法思考，不愿再感受。呼吸浅而急促，带着一丝甜蜜。

"Will you?" "你会吗？"

**Part 14 第 14 章**

Tokyo-3, the grand jewel of Japan, offers every one of its avenues to Asuka to plunder as she sees fit. It's not a futuristic city, but a strikingly modern one utilizing the the very best of mankind's engineering to be the safest, most customizable city mankind has ever seen. A necessary change, a growth after old Tokyo disappeared overnight in an apocalyptic natural disaster. Old Tokyo didn't have skyscrapers that could respond to tsunami and typhoons by disappearing beneath the ground, or fully collapsible, modifiable lanes and highways to weather the worst of an earthquake. She feels safe here, at least physically. All of the glass and steel - fragile and brittle though they seem, gives Asuka a taste of progress that Hakone lacks.  
东京-3，日本的瑰宝，将其每一条街道都任由明日香随心所欲地探索。这不是一个未来城市，而是一个利用人类工程学精华的现代都市，旨在成为人类有史以来最安全、最可定制的城市。这一必要的变化，是在旧东京在一夜之间因末日般的自然灾害消失后的一次成长。旧东京没有能应对海啸和台风而潜入地下的摩天大楼，也没有能抵御地震的最坏情况的可完全折叠、可修改的车道和高速公路。她在这里感到安全，至少在身体上是这样。所有的玻璃和钢铁——尽管它们看似脆弱易碎，却让明日香感受到了箱根所缺乏的进步。

It's the summer and Asuka is free. She strides through the streets of the city with a sense direction and confidence few around her match. She's not running through the crowds, chased by the clock or some social nervousness. Her shoulders are straight, her back strong, her chin held high.  
正值夏日，明日香自由自在。她大步流星地穿梭于城市街道，那份方向感和自信鲜有人能匹敌。她并非在人群中奔走，被时间或社交焦虑所追逐。她的肩膀挺直，背部坚实，下巴高昂。

A cloudless blue sky has made the entire world an infinite expanse in her eyes, though it also allows the sun to beat down like a pile driver of heat. She's glad that the yellow sundress and hay-white straw hat give freedom and airiness in equal measure. A water bottle sweats in her hand. She checks her phone for the time. There's a good hour left, long enough to pop into the coffee shop on the corner for something sweet and cold and altogether too expensive.  
万里无云的蓝天在她眼中将整个世界扩展成无限广阔，尽管这也让阳光如重锤般猛烈地炙烤着大地。她庆幸自己穿着黄色太阳裙和稻草白的草帽，既自由又轻盈。手中的水瓶因汗水而湿润。她查看手机确认时间，还有一个小时，足够拐进街角的咖啡店，享受一份既甜蜜又冰凉，且价格不菲的甜品。

She steps out of the heat and into the artificial arctic air of the cafe. It's busy, but she squeezes her way past loiterers and customers waiting at the service counter to get their orders. The coffee shop's decor is insecurely chic, confused if it is pushing the limit with its sleek table sets, all lightweight aluminum and new age wood veneers, or setting a classic mood in the corners where timeless, comfortable leather recliners wait to engulf customers with upholstered softness.  
她从炎热的户外步入咖啡馆内人造的极地冷气中。这里很繁忙，但她还是挤过闲逛者和在服务台前等待点单的顾客。咖啡店的装潢时尚而不自信，对于是否要以其轻巧的铝制桌椅和新潮的木饰面来挑战极限，还是角落里那些永恒舒适的皮革躺椅营造经典氛围，显得有些迷茫。

She reaches the front of the line with her order at the tip of her tongue when she is hit with a wave of familiarity as her eyes meet the barrista's. Behind her, people in the line shuffle in place awaiting their turn. A child cries somewhere in the dining area. A man on a bicycle flashes past the large windows.  
当她与咖啡师目光相遇时，一股熟悉感涌上心头，她已准备好点单。在她身后，排队的人们不安地挪动着脚步等待轮到自己。用餐区某处传来孩子的哭声。一个骑自行车的男子从大窗户前疾驰而过。

"I know you." Asuka says. The girl behind the counter looks at her questioningly before something of a practiced smile spreads across her face.  
“我认识你。”明日香说道。柜台后的女孩疑惑地看着她，随后脸上浮现出一个训练有素的微笑。

"Oh!" she exclaims, "How have you been? It's...hmm, it's Asuka, right?"  
"哦！" 她惊呼道，"你最近怎么样？这是...嗯，你是明日香，对吧？"

Asuka doesn't even pretend to know the girl's name. Thankfully, she wears a name tag.  
明日香甚至懒得假装记得那女孩的名字。幸好，她戴着名牌。

"Hikari," she nods. "We auditioned on the same day."  
"光，" 她点头说，"我们是在同一天试镜的。"

"How's the Tokyo-3 Conservatory? How are you? Did you - "  
东京第三音乐学院怎么样？你还好吗？你有没有——

"Hey! Get a move on!" a voice calls from the line. Asuka glares at the man, but Hikari bows in apology, a serious expression to match.  
"嘿！快点！" 队伍中传来一个声音。明日香瞪了那人一眼，而光则鞠躬道歉，表情严肃。

"My apologies, sir. Asuka, why don't I take your order and then I'll go on break in a few minutes and I'll meet you?"  
对不起，先生。明日香，要不我先帮你点餐，然后我过几分钟去休息，再去找你？

Asuka sits on one of the sleek, uncomfortable chairs and questions her decisions as she does so. She doesn't want to see this Hikari girl, barely recognized her, but in the past few months she's been attempting to, if not _calm down_, at least be a little kinder. A little more controlled. She slurps the frozen drink. Ignores the stares from the people at the nearest tables.  
明日香坐在一张光滑而不舒适的椅子上，边坐边质疑自己的决定。她并不想见这个叫光的女孩子，几乎没认出她来，但在过去的几个月里，她一直在尝试，即使不能平静下来，至少要变得更和善一些，更克制一些。她吸了一口冰冻饮料，对邻桌人们投来的目光视而不见。

"Sorry I took so long," Hikari casually unties the green apron she's wearing, then drapes it atop the chair she takes a seat on. Her freckles are dark and dotted against her wide, smiling cheeks.  
“抱歉，我来得有点晚，”光随意地解开身上的绿色围裙，然后将其搭在坐下的椅背上。她的雀斑深而明显，点缀在她宽阔、微笑的脸颊上。

"Anyway, how are you?" “那么，你最近怎么样？”

"I'm fine. Better than fine." she answers, never one to keep from bragging. Even unintentionally. "You?"  
"我很好，比好还要好。" 她回答道，从不吝啬自夸，即便是不经意间。"你呢？"

"Oh, I'm alright, I - "  
"哦，我还行，我——"

"Did you get into Tokyo-3 Conservatory after you auditioned?" the question slips through Asuka's teeth. It's the one tenuous connection she has to this girl, painful or not.  
"你试演后进入东京-3 音乐学院了吗？" 这个问题从明日香嘴里溜了出来。这是她与这个女孩之间唯一的脆弱联系，无论痛苦与否。

Confusion, and then a kind of pleasant recognition, show themselves on Hikari's face.  
光的脸上一开始是困惑，随后浮现出一种愉悦的认同。

"Oh, no," she laughs. "That one judge was so frightening! The big man. I'm sure you know the one. I tried my best, but I suppose it wasn't meant to be." She says, smiling down at her hands. "I'm in a general high school now. but I joined the band anyway. I can't really get away from music, you know? And now I can still help my family out at home."  
“哦，不，”她笑着说，“那个评委太吓人了！那个大个子。你肯定知道我说的是谁。我尽了全力，但我想这可能不是命中注定的。”她微笑着低头看着自己的手，“我现在就读于一所普通高中，但我还是加入了乐队。你知道的，我实在离不开音乐。现在我还能在家里帮帮忙。”

"How are you working here anyway? Neither of us are working ag - "  
“你怎么会在这里工作呢？我们俩都不是工作年龄 - ”

"Shh, shhh!" Hikari covers Asuka's mouth with her hand. "I might have fudged the numbers a bit, but we really need the extra income, so..." Hikari looks around the room to see if any of her coworkers have heard, but calm downs when she sees the rest of them aren't paying attention to her. "As a bribe," she giggles, "I'll give you a discount. I'm sure you come here often, seeing as how the Tokyo-3 Conservatory is so close by."  
"嘘，嘘！" 光用手捂住明日香的嘴。"我可能在数字上稍微动了点手脚，但我们真的很需要额外的收入，所以……" 光环顾四周，看看是否有同事听到了，但看到其他人并没有注意她，便松了口气。"作为贿赂，"她咯咯笑着说，"我会给你打个折。我敢肯定你经常来这里，毕竟东京-3 音乐学院就在附近。

Asuka almost lies. She considers it, sees the situation play out in her head in real time as if she's living it there and then. The praise she'd receive. The hidden envy. But she's trying to be good about this too, lying less. Being more truthful to herself and others. "I didn't get into Tokyo-3."  
明日香差点撒谎。她考虑了一下，脑海中实时上演着这一幕，仿佛身临其境。她会得到的赞扬。隐藏的嫉妒。但她也在努力做到这一点，少撒谎。对自己和他人更诚实。"我没被东京-3 录取。

"Wait, really?" Hikari asks, genuine surprise in her voice. "You know, I looked you up online after that audition. You just seemed so confident, and you mentioned something about Germany...I watched a video of you playing there, in Germany. You really are something special. It's surprising that you weren't accepted."  
"等等，真的吗？" 光惊讶地问道。"你知道，那次试演后我在网上查了你的资料。你看起来那么自信，还提到了德国……我看过你在德国演奏的视频。你真的很特别。你没被录取真是令人惊讶。

"Let's just say that the option was never there in the first place." Asuka says through gritted teeth. She squeezes the drink in her hand and only realizes what she's doing when some of the icy liquid spills over the lip of the covered cup and all over her hand. She takes a deep breath, wipes her fingers off with a napkin, sucks off the rest. "But I don't need that place to be great. Watch - you'll see me in five years headlining a world tour."  
"我们就当那个选项一开始就不存在吧。" 明日香咬牙切齿地说。她紧握着手中的饮料，直到冰冷的液体从杯盖边缘溢出，洒满她的手，她才意识到自己的动作。她深吸一口气，用纸巾擦去手指上的液体，剩下的则吮吸干净。"但我并不需要那个地方来证明我的伟大。等着瞧吧——五年后，你会看到我作为世界巡演的领衔主演。"

Most of Asuka actually believes this and whatever in her doubts it. is, like a dangerous bacteria, being fought each moment of each day by her mental immune system.  
明日香内心的大部分其实相信这一点，而那些怀疑的部分，就像危险的细菌一样，每天每刻都在被她的心理免疫系统所抵抗。

Some days are better. Some are worse.  
有些日子好过些，有些则更糟。

"I believe it," Hikari nods. She checks her phone, gives a little wink of apology. "Sorry, I don't have a lot of time. What school accepted you, then?"  
"我相信你，"光点头道。她查看了一下手机，歉意地眨了眨眼。"抱歉，我时间不多。那你被哪所学校录取了？"

"Hakone School of the Arts," she rolls her eyes. Over at the pick-up counter, a man grabs for his coffee but knocks it over. Hot coffee, a whole black river of it, pours down the lip of the counter and slaps on the floor in a waterfall.  
"箱根艺术学院，"她翻了个白眼。这时，取餐台那边，一个男人伸手去拿咖啡，却不慎将其打翻。滚烫的咖啡，如同一道黑色的河流，从柜台边缘倾泻而下，在地板上溅起一片瀑布。

"I think I ought to help them clean up. I have to be a star employee, like I'm a great class rep!" Hikari stands up, slings her apron back on as if it's a superhero's cape. "It was nice seeing you again, Asuka. Stop by sometime if you're in the area."  
"我觉得我应该去帮忙清理一下。我得表现得像个模范员工，就像我是个优秀的班长一样！"光站起身，像披上超级英雄的斗篷一样重新系上围裙。"再次见到你真好，明日香。如果你在这附近，记得来坐坐。"

"Yeah," she takes a sip, gets up from the table too. "I'll see you around."  
"嗯，"她抿了一口，也从桌边站了起来。"回头见。"

Hikari returns to the real world. Asuka leaves for one where she makes the rules.  
光回到了现实世界。明日香则前往了一个她能制定规则的地方。

---

She checks her phone again and curses under her breath at the few minutes she has left to make it. She pushes her way through the crowded streets, catches a flash of blue she knows instinctively now, but it's only the sky, peeking through the tinniest space of a down-hill alley between buildings. It's an unforgettable blue, tied so closely with Rei in her head that she has no control over how her heart skips in response. It's stupid. Unnecessary. Distracting.  
她再次查看手机，低声咒骂着所剩无几的时间。她挤过拥挤的街道，瞥见一抹她现在本能地认出的蓝色，但那只是天空，透过建筑物间下坡小巷中最狭窄的缝隙窥视。那是令人难忘的蓝色，与绫波紧密相连，以至于她无法控制自己的心跳因此而漏跳。这很愚蠢。不必要。让人分心。

She walks faster. 她走得更快了。

Like a shining beacon, the stairway leading to the pedestrian overpass crossing before the Tokyo-3 Conservatory building and its curved waves of steel and glass comes into view. They seem to lead up to the sky itself, the blue flat against the height of the landing. Asuka jogs the steps two at a time. She wipes the sweat from her forehead at the top, takes a sip of the remains of her water bottle.  
宛如一座闪耀的灯塔，通往东京第三音乐学院前的人行天桥的楼梯映入眼帘，其钢铁与玻璃的曲线波纹显得格外引人注目。它们仿佛直通天际，蓝色的天空紧贴着高耸的桥面。明日香一步两级地跑上台阶，在顶端擦去额头上的汗水，喝了一口水瓶里剩下的水。

"You're late." “你迟到了。”

Sitting on a bench, flipping through a book, Rei tilts her head up at the sound of Asuka's steps. The light seems to bend around her. To flicker and fade, highlighting the blue of her hair and the red of her eyes and the moon-pale skin until, even doing something as simple as reading a book, she appears sylph-like - sifting into the sunlight itself. Asuka's swallows thickly.  
坐在长椅上，翻阅着书本，听到明日香的脚步声，绫波微微抬头。光线似乎在她周围弯曲，闪烁并逐渐黯淡，突出了她发丝的蓝色、眼眸的红色以及如月光般苍白的肌肤。即便只是做着阅读这样简单的事情，她看起来也如同精灵一般——仿佛融入了阳光之中。明日香不由得咽了口口水。

"I'm not late. You guys can't start without me. I'm the leader here, after all."  
我没迟到。你们不能在我不在的时候开始。毕竟，我才是这里的领导。

The way her heart beats when Rei smiles should be criminal it breaks so many speeding records. She marches forward to the girl, a woman on a mission. Places one leg on the bench and leans forward into Rei's space. Grasps the book in her hand.  
当绫波微笑时，她的心跳速度之快，简直应该被视为违法，因为它打破了太多速度记录。她大步走向那个女孩，一个目标明确的女人。将一条腿放在长椅上，向前倾身进入绫波的空间，抓住了她手中的书。

"Put the book down when I show up, Rei."  
"当我出现时，放下书，丽。"

"Will you make me?" "你会逼我这么做吗？"

Rei _smirks_ - she actually smirks, and Asuka can't help but to pull the girl in firmly by the chin and kiss her hard. Deep. This is a taste she hadn't yet grown bored of, hoped that she never would. It hadn't happened in the months since she decided to stay. Since she and Rei had begun opening up to one another until there was nothing left unknown between them. Unspoken, perhaps. But not unknown. This smirk is just one consequence of Rei's growth from muted tones to vibrancy, just as Asuka's attempts at kindness and self control are.  
丽微微一笑——她真的笑了，这让明日香忍不住紧紧地捏住她的下巴，用力地吻了上去。深沉而热烈。这是她还未曾厌倦的味道，希望永远不会。自从她决定留下来的这几个月里，自从她和丽开始彼此敞开心扉，直到彼此间再无秘密。或许有些话未曾说出口，但绝非未知。这个微笑只是丽从沉默寡言到充满活力的成长中的一个结果，正如明日香尝试展现的温柔和自制一样。

When she pulls away - her fingers trailing the soft skin of Rei's face before her hand drops - she asks, "Where are the boys?"  
当她抽身离开——手指轻抚过绫的脸颊，随后手垂下——她问道：“男孩们在哪里？”

"A little ways down, closer to the Conservatory. They're setting things up now."  
“就在不远处，靠近温室那边。他们现在正在布置。”

"And you got away without helping?"  
“你就这样逃脱了帮忙？”

"As did you. My job was waiting for your arrival."  
"正如你一样。我的工作就是等待你的到来。"

"I had to see my case worker," Asuka flicks her hair, "Actual work. Boring. That guy is so stuffy."  
"我得去见我的个案工作者，"明日香甩了甩头发，"实际工作，无聊透顶。那家伙真是古板得要命。"

Rei stands up and holds her book against her side, face expectant and softly smiling. For the majority of the time Asuka has known her, Rei's default expression has been little more than a flat, reserved blankness, Asuka finds that she gets a thrill seeing any new expression at all on Rei's face. There's a library there, pages and pages, covers and covers, waiting to be explored and discovered, treasured and categorized: happy Rei, her smile wide and bright; sorrowful Rei, with glassy eyes and trembling lips; lustful Rei, burning red and pouting sensually. Asuka takes pride in knowing that she is the only person to see Rei make that last face. There, in the twin beds they pushed together, lying among a nest of blankets and pillows, aglow in the soft light of a lamp covered with a thin red t-shirt that throws the room into the color of a beating heart. Willing. Accepting. Hers.  
绫波站起身，将书紧贴在身侧，面带期待，微笑温柔。在明日香认识她的大部分时间里，绫波的默认表情不过是平淡而内敛的空白，明日香发现自己看到绫波脸上任何新的表情都会感到一阵兴奋。那里有一个图书馆，一页又一页，封面叠封面，等待着被探索和发现，珍藏和分类：快乐的绫波，笑容宽广而明亮；悲伤的绫波，眼含泪光，嘴唇颤抖；情欲的绫波，面颊绯红，性感地撅着嘴。明日香自豪地知道，她是唯一一个看到绫波露出那种表情的人。在那里，在她们推到一起的两张床上，躺在一堆毯子和枕头中，沐浴在覆盖着薄红 T 恤的台灯柔和的光线下，房间沉浸在跳动的心脏的颜色中。愿意的。接受的。属于她的。

But those aren't thoughts she should be thinking right now, and they aren't feelings she wants Rei to catch onto. Gotta keep up the hard exterior she's forged, at least out here under the sun.  
但这些念头此刻不该占据她的思绪，这些感受也不希望被绫波察觉。她必须维持那副坚硬的外壳，至少在这烈日之下。

"Come on, we should help those idiots." Asuka says. Rei nods. Without words, without even conscious thought, they each reach out to grasp the others' hand. The heat and humidity clearly make this a bad idea in less than a few moments, but she's not going to drop Rei's hand, not now. The girl accepts her. Maybe she was the first person to ever do that - her skills, her attitude, her issues - Rei didn't look away from any of it and Asuka wasn't about to let her.  
“走吧，我们得去帮帮那些笨蛋。”明日香说道。绫波点头。无需言语，甚至无需刻意思考，她们自然而然地伸出手，握住了对方的手。高温和潮湿显然让这个举动在几秒钟内就变得不明智，但她绝不会放开绫波的手，至少现在不会。绫波接纳了她。或许她是第一个这样做的人——她的能力，她的态度，她的困扰——绫波没有回避任何一点，而明日香也绝不会放手。

Shinji and Kaworu are awash in the bright sunlight reflecting off of the railings of the overpass, of the curved glass of the Conservatory building before them, of the powdered black music stands and beige folding chairs they're setting up. In a way, they too seem unreal, like their continued existence has only been a figment of Asuka's psyche, brought to bear whenever she needs subjects she can roll her eyes at. They are real, though. She isn't sure she wants to be the one to invent a coward like Shinji. The boy waves to both of them, though, and even offers his sister a direct and joyful smile. Little steps paving a path to better relations. Maybe he isn't a complete coward.  
真嗣和薰沐浴在立交桥栏杆、他们面前的温室建筑的弧形玻璃、以及他们正在布置的黑色粉末音乐架和米色折叠椅反射的明亮阳光中。在某种程度上，他们也显得不真实，仿佛他们的持续存在只是明日香心理中的一个幻象，每当她需要可以翻白眼的目标时，这个幻象就会显现。然而，他们是真实的。她不确定自己是否愿意成为发明像真嗣这样的懦夫的人。男孩向他们两人挥手，甚至直接向他的妹妹露出了一个快乐而真诚的微笑。小小的步伐铺就了通往更好关系的路。也许他并不是一个彻底的懦夫。

It helps that Rei hasn't spoken to Gendo in months.  
这有助于理解，因为绫波已经好几个月没有和元渡说话了。

"How'd your meeting go, Asuka?" Shinji asks.  
“你的会议怎么样，明日香？”真嗣问道。

"It's none of your business, is it?" then she shrugs, feeling the side-eye Rei throws her way. The silent pressure of it, the welcome weight of expectation. "Fine, I guess. I can return to Hakone with the rest of you when the semester starts. _Apparently_ I'm not a 'flight-risk' any more."  
"这与你无关，对吧？" 她耸了耸肩，感受到绫波投来的侧目。那无声的压力，那令人安心的期待之重。"好吧，我想我可以和你们一起在学期开始时回箱根。显然我现在不再是'逃跑风险'了。"

"I never thought I'd hear you be happy about being at Hakone." Kaworu, flipping through sheet music, looks at Asuka without even hiding his smirk.  
"我从没想过会听到你对去箱根感到高兴。" 薰翻阅着乐谱，看向明日香，连一丝笑意都未加掩饰。

"If I left Hakone, there wouldn't be a single worthwhile talent in the place."  
"如果我离开箱根，那里就一个有才华的人都不会剩下了。"

"I see. I'm always so impressed by your confidence, Asuka. Truly astounding to me. I almost wish dear Shinji here had even a tenth of that."  
"我明白了。你的自信总是让我印象深刻，明日香。真是让我叹为观止。我几乎希望我们亲爱的真嗣能有你十分之一的那种自信。"

"H-hey!" "喂，喂！"

Beside her, Rei giggles and the sound brings out Asuka's own snort of a laugh. It feels right. More than she ever could have imagined, it feels right to be here among these people. Friends, even if she won't call them that to their faces. She's glad she stayed. Glad she was convinced to stay with kisses as bribes. She's certainly paid them all back in full.  
在她旁边，绫波轻笑出声，这笑声引得明日香也发出了一声嗤笑。感觉很对。比她想象的还要对，和这些人在一起感觉很对。朋友，尽管她不会当面这么称呼他们。她很高兴留下来了。很高兴被那些作为贿赂的吻说服留下来。她当然已经加倍偿还了他们。

Asuka hadn't anywhere to go back to in the winter between their first and second semesters, cornered by her own fractal psyche and the lack of a place to belong, It was not charity she wanted to accept, but she could hardly turn down Misato when she offered to let her stay there until the dorms reopened. Rei, too, stayed with Misato, abandoned by and personally abandoning Gendo following the catastrophic music show. And despite her greatest fears - of boredom and anxiety, antsy skin and disrespectful glares - , things went well. Domesticity calmed Asuka in a way that the high-profile life she lived with her globe-trotting, emotionally frustrating mother never did. The effect was so great her caseworker let her stay at the school with the express concession that Misato took guardianship of the girl. She did so gladly.  
在第一和第二学期之间的冬天，明日香无处可归，被自己错综复杂的心理和无处安身所困。她不愿接受施舍，但当葛城美里提出让她暂住直到宿舍重新开放时，她又难以拒绝。绫波也与美里同住，在灾难性的音乐表演后，她被源堂抛弃，也亲自抛弃了他。尽管明日香最担心的是无聊、焦虑、坐立不安和无礼的目光，但一切进展顺利。家庭生活以她那全球奔波、情感复杂的母亲从未有过的方式安抚了她。这种影响如此之大，以至于她的社工允许她留在学校，并明确表示由美里担任她的监护人。美里欣然接受。

"Alright, conductor Kaji wants us to film the entire time we play here. Our choice of doing it in front of the Conservatory is, I anticipate, going to give us a bit of an edge on the live-recital films the other chamber groups in class will have, so let's make sure everyone is in their right place in the frame." Kaworu says after he stops laughing. He leans down into a black duffel bag to pick up a tripod and from a canvas bag slung across his body he pulls a small video camera.  
"好的，指挥家加持先生要求我们在这里演奏全程录像。选择在音乐学院前进行，我预计这将使我们在班级其他室内乐团的现场演奏录像中占得先机，所以请大家确保自己在画面中的位置正确。" 渚薰笑停后说道。他弯腰从一只黑色旅行包中取出三脚架，又从斜挎在身上的帆布包里掏出一台小型摄像机。

"Let's get this out of the way. There's no point to summer homework for students like us." Asuka rolls her eyes. "We're good enough not to need it."  
"我们直说吧，像我们这样的学生，暑假作业毫无意义。" 明日香翻了个白眼，"我们足够优秀，不需要它。"

"We haven't had much of a chance to see each other since the summer began. This is a nice opportunity for that, I believe." Rei offers.  
"自从暑假开始，我们就没有太多机会见面。我认为这是一个很好的机会。" 绫波提议道。

"I see you every day, Rei."  
"我每天都见到你，零。"

"I was talking about the entire group."  
"我指的是整个团队。"

"I don't care about the entire group."  
"我对整个团队并不关心。"

"I can tell when you are lying. You know that well, don't you?"  
"我知道你什么时候在撒谎。你很清楚这一点，不是吗？"

The heat blazing her cheeks has little to do with the weather. Asuka stomps over to where the boys have carefully placed their instruments - Kaworu using a plastic keyboard - and finds her violin. The cherrywood color almost matches her burnished hair. The tang of the red-orange is the same. She knows - has known for a while that she can't lie to Rei.  
她脸颊上的热辣与天气关系不大。明日香大步走向男孩们小心翼翼放置乐器的地方——薰用的是塑料键盘——找到了她的提琴。樱桃木的颜色几乎与她那光泽的头发相匹配。那红橙色的色调是一样的。她知道——早就知道她无法对绫波撒谎。

She's immensely happy about it.  
她对此感到无比高兴。

It was Asuka's idea to play here in a place where all of the students and faculty of the Tokyo-3 Conservatory could hear it all, could see the four of them underneath the bright sun, elevated high above the road. A last insult. A final send-off to a place that shunned her and hurt Rei, that crushed Shinji and abandoned Kaworu. A place they didn't need. A place she no longer wanted.  
是明日香提议在这里演奏，让东京-3 音乐学院的所有师生都能听见，都能看到他们四人在明媚的阳光下，高高凌驾于道路之上。这是最后的嘲讽。是对一个排斥她、伤害绫波、摧毁真嗣、抛弃渚薰的地方的最终告别。一个他们不再需要的地方。一个她再也不想要的地方。

"Alright, a little to the left, Asuka. Rei, make sure you stand straighter. Shinji?" Kaworu pokes his head out from the camera's viewfinder, winks. "Perfect, as always."  
“好了，明日香，稍微往左一点。绫波，确保站得更直一些。真嗣？”渚薰从相机的取景器中探出头来，眨了眨眼。“完美，一如既往。”

"Kaworu!" “渚薰！”

Close as it is to the building, the overpass is still too far to see inside the windows from where they stand; the glass making up the walls is wine-dark and reflective. Asuka likes to think she can _feel_ Gendo behind the glass, stern-faced. Pissed. She hopes he is. She lifts her bow, clears her voice.  
尽管天桥离建筑物很近，但从他们站立的位置仍然无法透过窗户窥见内部；构成墙壁的玻璃深如红酒，且具有反射性。明日香喜欢想象自己能感受到源堂在玻璃后面，面容严肃。愤怒。她希望他如此。她举起弓，清了清嗓子。

"Are you all ready? On my count. 1, 2, 3 - "  
“大家都准备好了吗？我数到三。1，2，3——”

She brings the bow across the strings. Holds back the innate fire in her heart and plays the piece in the pace it demands, rather than the one her body begs for. She's been practicing for months now. It's still difficult. Still impossible to hold the fire in her hands. But she tries anyway; failure is only a stone on the path to perfection.  
她将弓横过琴弦。抑制住内心的火焰，按照曲子要求的节奏演奏，而不是她身体渴望的节奏。她已经练习了几个月。这仍然很难。仍然无法控制手中的火焰。但她还是尝试了；失败只是通往完美之路上的一个垫脚石。

A crowd begins to form - first around them, on the overpass, and then below them, pouring out from the Conservatory building. Students look up at them, heads tilted, ears open. The pressure mounts in her muscles as the desire to just go all out, to explode in movement and brightness, is all she can feel. But she doesn't. She won't. Bizet's _Piano Quartet No. 1 Op 15_ deserves better. She, Rei, the listeners - everyone deserves better.  
人群开始聚集——起初是在他们周围，在立交桥上，然后是在他们下方，从音乐学院大楼涌出。学生们抬头望着他们，头微微倾斜，耳朵竖起。她感到肌肉中的压力越来越大，渴望全力以赴，爆发出动作和光芒，这是她唯一能感受到的。但她没有这么做。她不会这么做。比才的《第一钢琴四重奏》Op 15 值得更好的表现。她，丽，听众——每个人都值得更好的。

Her finger slips on one of the strings and the wrong note tumbles off the violin. Time stands still like it's waiting for Asuka to react, as if it has taken a backseat in the ride of reality. She is thrown off for a second at the mercy of her runaway heart. A panic builds, but she breaths deeply and glances side-eyed at Rei. Rei looks back, smiles softly. Another deep breath. She will not give up. She will not run away.  
她的手指在琴弦上滑了一下，错误的音符从提琴上滚落。时间仿佛静止了，好像在等待明日香反应，仿佛它已经退居现实之旅的后座。她一时之间被失控的心跳所左右。一阵恐慌涌起，但她深吸一口气，用眼角余光瞥向丽。丽回望她，温柔地微笑。再次深呼吸。她不会放弃。她不会逃避。

Asuka is _trying_. It's more than she can say about what she did before.  
明日香正在努力。这比她之前所做的要多得多。

She listens for Rei beneath all the music. Hears her own notes curling around Rei's. Leading the sound, leading the group. They play on into the shining blue day with true joy There will be bigger stages in the future. But this might be a good starting point, she thinks.  
她在音乐中寻找零的声音。听见自己的音符环绕着零的音符，引领着旋律，引领着团队。他们带着真挚的喜悦，继续演奏在这明媚的蓝天之下。未来会有更大的舞台，但她想，这或许是一个不错的起点。

It _will be_ a good starting point, she knows, on her way to Perfection. And she's glad - maddeningly glad - to take Rei along into that glowing beyond.  
她知道，这将是一个通往完美之路的良好开端。她无比欣喜——欣喜若狂——能带着零一同迈向那光辉的未来。
