### Chapter 1 **The first 48 hours 最初的 48 小时**

My stomach is still churning by the time I make it back to my position on the beach. I'm not able to keep anything down at the moment it seems. Even water seems to have difficulty staying in my system. It's been this way for the past two days now. I'll try to eat or drink something from the supplies I've scavenged but an hour or two later I'll be consumed by the thoughts, by the loneliness and the guilt and I'll have to run off to throw up whatever is in my system.  
当我回到海滩上的位置时，我的胃仍在翻腾。目前看来，我似乎无法保持任何东西在胃里。甚至连水都难以留在我的体内。这种情况已经持续了过去两天。我会尝试吃一些或喝一些我从废墟中搜刮来的补给，但一两个小时后，我就会被那些思绪、孤独和内疚所吞噬，不得不跑去吐出体内的东西。

I'm alone here. Maybe it'll always be this way and maybe I deserve it. After all this is my fault. I could have prevented it if I had been a little bit stronger. If I had listened more, if I had taken notice and not been so afraid. Instead I was a coward, I was sneaky and I did horrible things. I was passive when I shouldn't have been and I acted when I shouldn't have done. Now everyone is lost, out there in that hellish red sea and I am alone.  
我独自一人在这里。也许这种情况会永远持续下去，也许这是我应得的。毕竟，这都是我的错。如果我再坚强一点，如果我多听一些，如果我注意到而不是那么害怕。相反，我是个懦夫，我偷偷摸摸，我做了可怕的事情。该被动时我被动，不该行动时我却行动了。现在，所有人都迷失在那片地狱般的红海中，而我孤独一人。

Everyone is gone and it's all my fault. My guardian, the only person to willingly invite me into their home. Provide me with the love of a parent is gone. I watched her die. It was my fault because I couldn't find it within myself to do anything because I was selfish she got shot and she died.  
所有人都离开了，这都是我的错。我的监护人，唯一一个自愿邀请我进入他们家的人。给予我父母般的爱的人已经不在了。我亲眼看着她死去。这都是我的错，因为我无法找到勇气去做任何事，因为我自私，她被枪击中，然后死去。

Ritsuko, the technicians, Rei and even my father. They're all gone and it's all my fault.  
律子、技术人员们、绫波，甚至我的父亲。他们都离开了，这都是我的错。

Asuka, she's gone as well. That's the one that hurts the most. That's the one that twists my stomach and causes me to vomit. I sat by and did nothing while she was killed. I listened to it all and I could have done something. I could have ordered it to move so I could fight but I sat there and did nothing. That isn't even the worst of it. Before her fight I visited her in the hospital. I wanted to see her after what had happened with Kaworu.  
明日香，她也走了。这最让我心痛。这让我胃部绞痛，让我呕吐。我坐在那里，什么也没做，眼睁睁看着她被杀。我听着这一切，本可以做些什么。我本可以命令它移动，这样我就能战斗，但我坐在那里，什么也没做。这还不是最糟糕的。在她战斗之前，我曾在医院探望她。在发生与渚薰的事情后，我想见她。

Asuka was, well Asuka was special to me. She was the only one out of all of them who would be honest with me. She wasn't afraid to hold anything back. Sometimes she might have been a bit harsh and she could be arrogant, she could be lazy but she was beautiful and talented and no one truly knew what lay behind her eyes. I loved her and I let her down in so many ways. I was so broken.  
明日香对我来说，嗯，明日香对我来说是特别的。她是所有人中唯一会对我坦诚相待的人。她从不畏惧直言不讳。有时她可能有点严厉，她可能傲慢，可能懒惰，但她美丽且才华横溢，没有人真正了解她眼底隐藏着什么。我爱她，却在许多方面辜负了她。我如此支离破碎。

So when Third Impact started, when the voices and souls of Rei and Kaworu spoke to me do you know what I did? I wished for death. Not for me but for everyone. I wished for an endless world of nothingness. I actually wished for the human race to die. They persuaded me otherwise. They showed me other worlds, other places where I could live without pain and suffering. Where I could be with the people I loved. Do you know what happened though? I realized that those worlds were just hollow and empty. That there was no joy to be found in them because there was nothing negative there either. I realized that tearing down the walls between people completely would result in nothing, that we needed them to exist and be human. So I called for them to be restored.  
所以当第三次冲击开始时，当绫波和渚的灵魂与声音对我说话时，你知道我做了什么吗？我祈求死亡。不是为了我自己，而是为了所有人。我渴望一个无尽的虚无世界。我甚至希望人类灭绝。他们说服了我，向我展示了其他世界，其他地方，在那里我可以免受痛苦和苦难，与我所爱的人在一起。但你知道发生了什么吗？我意识到那些世界只是空洞和虚无。在那里找不到快乐，因为没有负面情绪的存在。我意识到，完全打破人与人之间的隔阂会导致一无所有，我们需要这些隔阂来存在并作为人类。于是我呼唤它们被重建。

In that final act I was told that anyone can return as long as they're able to imagine themselves in their hearts. Two days later I sit alone on this beach. I'm so tired.  
在那最后的行动中，我被告知只要心中能想象自己存在，任何人都可以回来。两天后，我独自坐在这片海滩上。我太累了。

**The Spirit of Man… 人类之灵……**

When I awake I'm aware of two things. First my stomach is still hurting and secondly I'm not alone on this beach anymore. There is someone else here to my left. I open my eyes and I can feel them widen immediately at what I see. There she is lying next to me, Asuka. She isn't moving but as I sit up I can see she is alive.  
当我醒来时，我意识到两件事。首先，我的胃还在痛，其次，我不再独自一人在这片海滩上了。左边还有一个人。我睁开眼睛，看到她时立刻瞪大了双眼。她就躺在我的旁边，是明日香。她没有动，但当我坐起来时，我能看出她还活着。

I notice she has a bandage over her right arm is heavily bandaged and her left eye is also covered in bandages. Her other eye is open but not moving, has she noticed me? Does she know where she is? I get up and look at her and suddenly I'm hit by a mixture of emotions.  
我注意到她的右臂缠着厚厚的绷带，左眼也被绷带覆盖。另一只眼睛虽然睁着，却一动不动，她注意到我了吗？她知道自己身在何处吗？我起身看着她，突然间被一股复杂的情绪击中。

Anger, Hatred, Fear, Sadness, Rage. They hit me at once and before I know it I'm sitting over her. My hands are edging closer to her throat. She still hasn't acknowledged me, she still hasn't moved. This isn't my Asuka, if it was she'd have yelled at me by now. She would have noticed me by now. She'd have called me an idiot or she would have hurt me for what I did to her!  
愤怒、憎恨、恐惧、悲伤、狂怒，这些情绪同时向我袭来，我还没反应过来就已经坐在她身旁。我的手不由自主地向她的喉咙靠近。她依然没有注意到我，依然没有动弹。这不是我认识的明日香，如果是她，早就该对我大吼大叫了。她早该注意到我了。她会骂我白痴，或者因为我对她所做的一切而伤害我！

This is an illusion, conjured by my own mind. I'm terrified of the image of her, after all I did. I caused her to die. If she sees me she's going to kill me. I have to act first. I can't take this anymore and I feel my hands tighten around her throat. Her throat is cold to the touch, immediately I feel her body spasm below me in reaction to my actions. I begin to choke harder and her eyes finally come to life. She looks around frantically before looking straight up at me. I don't release my grip.  
这是幻觉，由我自己的心所制造。我对她的形象感到恐惧，毕竟我做了那么多。是我导致了她的死亡。如果她看到我，她会杀了我。我必须先下手为强。我再也忍受不了了，感觉自己的手紧紧掐住她的喉咙。她的喉咙触感冰冷，我立刻感觉到她的身体在我身下因我的行为而痉挛。我开始更用力地掐紧，她的眼睛终于有了生气。她慌乱地四处张望，然后直直地看向我。我没有松手。

Next thing I feel is her bandaged hand reaching up to my cheek. Her touch is soft and gentle as she strokes me softly. I suddenly realize I'm making a mistake. I release my hands from around her and without making a sound I feel tears begin to fall from my eyes. I can't control it but now they're flowing freely down my face and onto her body. I can see them splashing on her face and the remains of her plugsuit. She whispers weakly.  
接下来我感觉到的是她缠着绷带的手伸向我的脸颊。她的触碰轻柔而温和，轻轻地抚摸着我。我突然意识到自己犯了个错误。我松开了环绕着她的双手，没有发出任何声音，泪水开始从我的眼中滑落。我无法控制，它们现在自由地流淌在我的脸上，滴落在她的身体上。我能看到它们溅在她的脸上和残破的驾驶服上。她虚弱地低语。

"How disgusting." “多么恶心。”

I was so very wrong this is my Asuka. I collapse forward onto her and close my eyes. The tears are still running down my face but I feel her put her arms around me and stroke my hair until I fall asleep again.  
我错得离谱，这才是我的明日香。我向前倒在她身上，闭上了眼睛。泪水依旧顺着我的脸颊流下，但我感觉到她用双臂环抱着我，抚摸着我的头发，直到我再次入睡。

**I'm not a strong person  
我不是一个坚强的人**

I let him sleep on top of me for a short while. I didn't want to move him, I can't imagine he's had a lot of rest since he returned from that red sea. Eventually I needed to move him. I had to move my limbs, I had to find something to eat and I had to find something to soothe the soreness in my throat. I wonder how long he has been here for.  
我让他短暂地躺在我身上。我不想移动他，难以想象自从他从那片红海回来后，他有多少休息时间。最终我需要移动他。我得活动我的四肢，我得找点吃的，还得找点东西缓解喉咙的酸痛。我不知道他在这里待了多久。

I look around at the meagre camp he has set up for himself. It's got a fire, a few boxes of scavenged supplies and blankets. Barely any of it has been used. The idiot is the only one here and he can't even look after himself properly. It's a good thing I'm here now.  
我环顾四周，看着他为自己搭建的简陋营地。这里有火堆，几箱搜刮来的补给品和毯子。几乎都没怎么用过。这个傻瓜只有一个人，连自己都照顾不好。幸好我现在在这里。

I take something from the supplies, I realize that I'm craving chocolate for some reason. Isn't that strange? Come back after the apocalypse and I want chocolate? Fortunately there is some there. I also grab a blanket and place it over the idiot while he sleeps. He looks so peaceful for a change, it's cute.  
我从补给品中拿了些东西，不知为何突然很想吃巧克力。这难道不奇怪吗？末日之后回来，我居然想吃巧克力？幸好那里还有一些。我还拿了一条毯子，轻轻盖在他身上，他睡着时看起来异常平静，真是可爱。

I admit, I don't really know how to feel about Shinji Ikari at this moment in time. I don't really know how to feel about a lot of things right now. I've just returned from sharing thoughts and memories with everyone on the planet including him. I've discovered things about myself I probably didn't need to discover. I've gone over my own issues numerous times, resolved them and looped back around to running away from them again. I've forgotten most of it now and been left with a strange emptiness. Every now and then something will poke at me and I'll feel a flash of sadness or anger, or rage or happiness but it's a bit of a jumble. I guess it's a side effect of returning.  
我承认，此刻我对碇真嗣的感觉颇为复杂。现在我对很多事情都感到迷茫。我刚与包括他在内的全球所有人分享了思想和记忆。我发现自己了解了一些或许不需要知道的事情。我多次审视自己的问题，解决后又逃避，如今大部分已遗忘，只留下一种奇怪的空虚感。偶尔会有什么触动我，让我感到一阵悲伤、愤怒、狂怒或快乐，但这些情绪都有些混乱。我想，这大概是回归的副作用吧。

For now I look across at one of the strongest people I've ever met. Many would be surprised to hear me admit that but it's true. He may not seem it but no one knows him like I do. When you look at him he doesn't look like much, he comes across as so wimpy and lacking in backbone it annoys you. That's why I always tried so hard to hate him. He was strong without having to come across as such.  
此刻，我凝视着对面那位我曾见过的最坚强的人之一。许多人听到我承认这一点会感到惊讶，但这是事实。他可能看起来并不如此，但没有人像我这样了解他。当你看向他时，他显得那么软弱无力，缺乏骨气，这让你感到恼火。这就是为什么我总是努力试图去恨他。他强大，却无需表现得如此。

People have always commented on how strong I am but it was bullshit. All I did was put on a front. I didn't need anybody, I was never going to cry and I was never going to fall in love. Except all of that was untrue. I needed somebody, I did cry and I definitely fell in love. Except my own pride and stubbornness prevented me from accepting that. So I lashed out at others. I yelled at them, I screamed at them and I hurt them.  
人们总是称赞我有多坚强，但这都是胡说。我所做的只是装腔作势。我不需要任何人，我永远不会哭泣，也永远不会坠入爱河。然而，这一切都是假的。我需要某个人，我确实哭了，也确实坠入了爱河。只是我的骄傲和固执让我无法接受这一点。所以我向他人发泄。我朝他们大喊，对他们尖叫，伤害他们。

He on the other hand. He was afraid of being hurt but he tried anyway. He got knocked down but he didn't give up. He tried to believe in people and he got betrayed and knocked back again and again and again. Until he became so broken he tried to end the world. I don't blame him. I'd have done the same only I don't think I'd have been strong enough to reverse it. I'd have given the world the middle finger and sent it straight to hell.  
而他呢，他害怕受伤却依然尝试。他被打倒了，但没有放弃。他试图相信别人，却一次又一次地被背叛和击退。直到他变得支离破碎，甚至试图毁灭世界。我不怪他。我也会做同样的事，只是我不认为自己有足够的力量去逆转这一切。我会对这个世界竖起中指，直接送它下地狱。

Look at what I'm saying. If it was me I'd have done the same? It was me and that is exactly what I did. The first soul he sought out in that world where all the walls went down was me. He came to me! Not Misato, not his father, not his mother, not his friends the stooges or Rei Ayanami but me. He came to me and you know what I did. I told him how pathetic and weak he was. I told him how scared he was of everyone else and how he didn't deserve anything because he couldn't even love himself. I told him how sick he made me.  
看看我在说什么。如果是我，我也会这么做？那就是我，我确实那么做了。在那个所有壁垒都崩塌的世界里，他第一个寻找的灵魂就是我。他来找我了！不是美里，不是他的父亲，不是他的母亲，不是他的朋友三傻，也不是绫波零，而是我。他来找我，你知道我做了什么。我告诉他他有多么可悲和软弱。我告诉他他有多害怕别人，以及他不配拥有任何东西，因为他甚至不爱自己。我告诉他他让我感到多么恶心。

I shoved him to the ground and kicked him while he was down and then I watched with pleasure as he flipped out and started throwing furniture around before setting his sights on me. So while Shinji might have been the one to make the call I was the catalyst in all of it. I was the spark for Shinjis wish.  
我把他推倒在地，趁他倒下时踢了他几脚，然后幸灾乐祸地看着他发狂，开始乱扔家具，最后把目标转向了我。虽然可能是真嗣打的电话，但这一切的导火索是我。我是实现真嗣愿望的火花。

Despite all that I put him through at that time he kept on calling for me during it. I could feel my soul being pulled towards him even as I tried to escape. I kept on telling him he made me sick, I kept on telling him he was pathetic. Yet he'd call for me and then he told me something that hasn't left my mind. He told me that me and him, we're the same. Maybe it's true. We're both from broken homes. My mother died when I was four years old. I watched her die, I found the body. My father, I blamed him and I hated him. He put Mama into that machine which lead to her death. While she was in the hospital he was fucking one of the nurses absorbed in his own guilt.  
尽管那时我对他百般折磨，他却在过程中一直呼唤着我。我试图逃离，却能感觉到自己的灵魂被他牵引。我不断告诉他他让我恶心，他很可悲。然而他依然呼唤我，并告诉我一些至今萦绕心头的话。他说我和他，我们是一样的。或许是真的。我们都来自破碎的家庭。我四岁时母亲去世了。我亲眼看着她死去，发现了她的尸体。我父亲，我怪罪他，我恨他。他把妈妈送进了那台机器，导致了她的死亡。妈妈在医院时，他却在沉迷于自己的愧疚中与一名护士鬼混。

For Shinji, well there was no body for him to discover. Does that make it any better or worse I wonder? Does it even matter? We can't really measure grief it affects us differently. His father abandoned him after that, sent him to live with a teacher. Shinji had no family to try to support him like I did. Here is the twist, while I had a family trying to reach through to me I rejected them all. He was reaching out for a family but they rejected him.  
对于真嗣来说，他甚至没有一具遗体去发现。这会让事情变得更好还是更糟呢？我疑惑着。这真的重要吗？我们无法真正衡量悲伤，它对每个人的影响都是不同的。他的父亲在那之后抛弃了他，将他送到一位老师那里生活。真嗣没有像我这样的家人试图支持他。转折点在于，尽管我有家人试图接近我，我却拒绝了他们所有人。而他渴望家庭的温暖，却遭到了拒绝。

I'm not saying Shinji is perfect though. It's not like he didn't do anything bad before Third Impact. He did something bad alright and that is where a lot of my anger lies. I saw what he did to me in the hospital. I saw him reach down and touch himself in front of me. I saw him soil his own hand and I saw his reaction afterwards as he ran out of the room to throw up.  
我并不是说真嗣是完美的。并非他在第三次冲击之前没有做过坏事。他的确做了一些糟糕的事情，这也是我愤怒的根源之一。我在医院里看到了他对我的所作所为。我看到他伸手触碰自己，就在我面前。我看到他弄脏了自己的手，也看到了他事后冲出房间呕吐的反应。

It makes me sick, it makes me angry that he did such a thing. I know how fucked up he was and how broken he was but I still need to talk to him about it. I need to have that discussion no matter how uncomfortable it is. It can wait though, for now he needs me. This isolation has gotten to him.  
这让我感到恶心，也让我愤怒，因为他做了那样的事。我知道他有多么混乱和破碎，但我仍然需要和他谈谈这件事。无论多么不舒服，我都必须进行这场对话。不过，这可以稍后再说，现在他需要我。这种孤立已经影响到了他。

I'm not sure how long I've been sat here but he finally starts to stir from his slumber. He sits up and looks over towards me. I can see the fear in his eyes immediately. He's feeling guilty about what he did to me when I appeared. I reach to the supplies I have next to me and hand him the dry crackers.  
我不确定自己坐在这里多久了，但他终于从沉睡中开始动弹。他坐起身，朝我这边看过来。我立刻从他的眼中看到了恐惧。他对我出现时所做的事情感到内疚。我伸手去拿我旁边的补给品，递给他一些干饼干。

"Here, eat these. Not the tastiest but they'll help with your stomach. You haven't been able to keep anything down have you?"  
“来，吃点这些。虽然味道不怎么样，但能帮你缓解胃部不适。你一直没能吃下东西，对吧？”

Shinji looks at me unsure of whether to take the packet from me. Eventually does so and looks at me sheepishly, "H-How did you know?"  
真嗣看着我，不确定是否要从我手中接过那包饼干。最终他还是接了过去，有些羞怯地看着我，“你……你怎么知道的？”

"You're pale, you've clearly lost weight since the last time I saw you and I saw the… evidence when I had a look around unfortunately."  
"你脸色苍白，显然自上次见面以来瘦了不少，而且我...不幸地四处查看时发现了那些...证据。"

He looks away from me, clearly embarrassed. I decide to ask him how long he has been back for.  
他避开我的目光，显然感到尴尬。我决定问他回来多久了。

"Two days… I think." "大概...两天吧。"

He takes one of the crackers and nibbles at it slowly. I keep a stern eye on him to make sure he eats the entire thing. We sit there in silence with only the sounds of him eating and the waves on the beach to keep us company. I decide to hand him the bottle of water I grabbed as well.  
他拿起一块饼干，慢慢地小口咬着。我严肃地盯着他，确保他把整块都吃完。我们静静地坐在那里，只有他吃东西的声音和海浪拍岸的响声陪伴着我们。我决定把拿来的那瓶水也递给他。

"Drink this as well, only a few small sips though. You should be able to keep all of that down okay?"  
“也喝点这个，不过只能小口喝几下。你应该能把这些都好好消化吧？”

He takes it and has a few small sips out of the bottle and brings the blanket around him. "Thank you."  
他接过水瓶，小口喝了几下，然后拉紧了身上的毯子。“谢谢。”

"No problem." "没问题。"

I reach around for the final thing I brought from my little scavenging trip earlier. I passed a little book store and knowing about Shinjis condition grabbed a few volumes of manga from within. I skipped the giant robot stuff and went for the comedy or action stuff. I hand him one of the volumes and he looks at me confused.  
我从之前的小探险中拿出了最后一样东西。路过一家小书店时，得知新治的状况，便顺手挑了几本漫画。我跳过了巨型机器人题材，选了些喜剧或动作类的。我递给他一本，他一脸困惑地看着我。

"It isn't quite your SDAT I know, and I can't vouch for the quality of it but it'll help keep your mind off of your stomach. You need to rest but I can't have you going back to sleep yet, I need to watch over you. I don't think either of us are up for talking so that'll have to do."  
“我知道这不是你的 SDAT，我也不能保证它的质量，但它能帮你暂时忘掉胃痛。你需要休息，但我还不能让你继续睡，我得看着你。我想我们俩现在都没心情聊天，所以这本漫画就派上用场了。”

He smiles at me. I feel a warm glow inside me at his smile. I wonder if that's the first time he's smiled since returning. It's probably the first time I've seen him smile in weeks. "It's perfect, thanks."  
他对我微笑。看到他的笑容，我内心感到一阵温暖。不知道这是他回来后的第一个微笑吗？也许是我几周来第一次看到他笑。“太完美了，谢谢。”

He sits up and starts to read as I return to looking out amongst the sea wondering if and when other people might start to come back. Every now and then I'll steal a glance at Shinji. I have to keep looking away when I start to think about how cute he is. I don't need those sorts of thoughts right now. I need to stay focused and strong until we're able to get off of this beach.  
他坐起身开始阅读，而我则继续望向大海，思索着是否以及何时其他人会开始回来。时不时我会偷瞄一眼真嗣。每当开始觉得他可爱时，我不得不移开视线。现在不需要那些念头。我需要保持专注和坚强，直到我们能够离开这片海滩。

The more I try to force it away the more the thought remains and my mind starts to wander to other places. In my mind I'm edging closer towards him. I'm putting my arm around him and pulling him towards me. It's escalating until I'm fucking him right there and then. I start to feel something in my lower body and I awkwardly close my legs together and try to force that particular one away. Definitely a thought for a later date, although I might have to alter it slightly to remove certain elements from this little hellish landscape. That'd be a sight, two horny teenagers fucking while the head of Rei Aya-fucking-nami looks on.  
我越是试图驱散这个念头，它就越是挥之不去，我的思绪开始飘向别处。在我的想象中，我逐渐靠近他。我伸出胳膊搂住他，将他拉向我。情势愈演愈烈，直到我在那里直接与他发生关系。我开始感到下体有些异样，尴尬地并拢双腿，试图强行驱散那个念头。这绝对是留待以后再想的情景，尽管我可能需要稍作修改，去除这片小地狱景观中的某些元素。那将会是一幕，两个欲火中烧的青少年在雷·阿亚-他妈-阿南面前做爱。

"Asuka are you alright?" “明日香，你还好吗？”

I'm pulled from my distasteful thoughts by his voice and jump slightly. Turning to him I nod, "Yeah I'm fine. What's the matter? Is it your stomach?"  
我被他的声音从厌恶的思绪中拉回，微微一跳。转向他，我点头，“嗯，我没事。怎么了？是你的胃不舒服吗？”

He shakes his head, "It's feeling alright… I was just wondering if I could have another of the crackers that's all."  
他摇摇头，“感觉还好……我只是想问问能不能再吃一片饼干。”

I hand him the packet and he takes one along with another sip of water. I'm not sure how much time has passed since he started eating but I can feel my eyes starting to grow heavy. I need to stay awake though, I need to watch over him.  
"我把饼干递给他，他拿了一片，又喝了口水。我不确定他开始吃东西后过了多久，但能感觉到自己的眼皮开始沉重。我需要保持清醒，我得看着他。”

"Hey Asuka…" "嘿，明日香…"

"Mmm hmm…" "嗯哼…"

"I think… I'll be alright if you want to get some rest."  
"我想…如果你想要休息一下，我会没事的。"

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

He nods, "Yeah…" 他点点头，“嗯……”

He starts to pass me the blanket but I feel myself shake my head. I edge closer to him and move the little makeshift pillow he has been using along. I cover myself with the blanket ensuring he still has it covering him too.  
他开始把毯子递给我，但我感觉自己摇了摇头。我向他挪近了一些，把他用的小枕头也移了过来。我用毯子把自己裹起来，确保他也还盖着。

"You need to stay warm."  
“你需要保暖。”

I instruct him sternly but not before letting out a yawn, "If you feel ill at all wake me okay. I'll just rest my eyes for a bit."  
我严厉地吩咐他，但在打了个哈欠之后才说：“如果你感到不舒服，就叫醒我，好吗？我只是闭目养神一会儿。”

I can feel his warmth beside me and before I know it I've fallen asleep.  
我能感觉到他在我身旁的温暖，不知不觉间我就睡着了。

### Chapter 2 **Twisted Coil**
It feels strange the next time I wake up. I almost feel like I'm someplace else. Like I'm back home in the apartment. There is a certain warmth to it that I only felt when I was there. It takes a few moments for me to realize I'm not back there. That I'm still on the beach covered lying on a makeshift bed built on scavenged blankets. I have a soft bag for a pillow and the campfire is starting to go out.  
再次醒来时，感觉很奇怪。我几乎觉得我身处别处。就像回到了家里的公寓。那里有一种我只在那时才感受到的温暖。我花了好一会儿才意识到自己并没有回去。我仍然躺在沙滩上，身下是用捡来的毯子搭成的临时床铺。我用一个柔软的袋子当枕头，篝火也渐渐熄灭了。

My attention is immediately drawn to the sleeping figure next to me. For a time I'm almost tempted to reach out my hand and stroke her soft red hair. I want to wrap my arm over her and snuggle into her back and hold her tight. I want to feel her warmth next to me but I can't do that. I don't deserve to do that. I don't even deserve to have her in this close proximity. Not after what I did to her. Instead I edge back a little bit and turn onto my back.  
我的注意力立刻被身边的睡影吸引。有那么一会儿，我几乎忍不住想伸出手去抚摸她柔软的红发。我想用胳膊环抱住她，紧贴她的后背，紧紧抱住她。我想感受她的温暖，但我不能这么做。我不配这么做。我甚至不配与她如此接近。尤其是在我对她做了那些事之后。于是我稍稍后退了一些，转过身去仰躺着。

I'm not sure how long I've slept for but my stomach lets out a grow signifying it wants me to eat. That's a first since returning. For the past couple of days I've eaten out of necessity and thrown it back up shortly afterwards. This time I actually seem to be hungry and there is no sign of the churning that has been there. Maybe just having her near me has helped, having her be nice to me for that short period of time and look after a bit helped.  
我不确定自己睡了多久，但我的肚子发出了一声咕噜，表明它想让我吃点东西。自从回来后，这还是第一次。过去几天里，我都是出于需要才吃东西，然后很快就吐了出来。这次我似乎真的饿了，也没有那种翻江倒海的感觉。也许只是因为她在我身边，那短暂的温柔和照顾，真的帮到了我。

I've actually realized how nice she has been since she returned. I wonder how long it can last for. I don't deserve her kindness. Not after what I've done, I don't deserve to have her near me at all. By all rights she should hate me right now. She should be hitting me, yelling at me and berating me. Yet she's sleeping peacefully by my side. After everything I did, I left her to die and I…  
我其实已经意识到她回来后对我有多好。我不知道这种状态能持续多久。我不配得到她的善意。在我做了那些事之后，我根本不配让她在我身边。按理说，她现在应该恨我。她应该打我，对我大喊大叫，责骂我。然而她却在我身边安然入睡。在我做了那么多之后，我抛下她等死，而我……

Oh god I feel my stomach churn at the thought of it. I'm not going to be sick but I instinctively look at my hand. I've washed it a hundred times but I can still see the stains there from where I spilled my seed. I've never felt more disgusted with myself in my life. I did that while she was there comatose in the room and she knows about it. She knows about the other times I've fantasized about her as well. All those times I've lay there in my room and thought about her. Each time I've always felt so guilty afterwards. It's supposed to be natural but I always felt so wrong after it.  
哦天哪，一想到这个我就觉得胃里翻江倒海。虽然不至于生病，但我本能地看向自己的手。我已经洗了上百遍，可那些因我洒下种子而留下的污渍仿佛还在。我这辈子从未如此厌恶过自己。她在房间里昏迷不醒时，我竟然做了那样的事，她全都知道。她知道我曾多次幻想她。那些我独自躺在房间里，满脑子都是她的时刻。每次事后我都感到无比内疚。这本该是自然而然的事，但我总觉得这样做之后心里很不对劲。

I clench my hand into a fist and try to think about something else. I can't think about that now, I can't keep going in this circle but I wonder when she is going to bring it up. It's only a matter of time until she does. She isn't going to be nice to me forever, no one can be nice to me for that amount of time. She'll get better and by that time there will be others.  
我紧握拳头，试图想些别的事情。现在不能想这些，我不能继续在这个圈子里打转，但我好奇她什么时候会提起这件事。她迟早会说的。她不可能永远对我这么好，没有人能长时间这样对我好。她会好起来的，到那时会有其他人出现。

No. I can't keep thinking like that. That wasn't why I came back but it isn't that simple. I'm here on this beach looking at a landscape that was my fault. I'm lying next to someone who is covered in bandages that wouldn't be there if it wasn't for me. I came back with the idea that in order for me to be happy I needed to accept the pain reality brought me. That even if I got hurt there was always the chance to be happy. That even though I hated who I was I could learn to love myself. I need to break out of this somehow. I need to push forward somehow but I need guidance… I need you Asuka.  
不，我不能一直这样想。我回来不是因为这个，但事情没那么简单。我站在这片海滩上，眼前的景象是我造成的。我躺在一个全身缠满绷带的人旁边，如果不是因为我，这些绷带本不会存在。我回来时想着，为了快乐，我需要接受现实带来的痛苦。即使受伤，也有机会快乐。即使我讨厌自己，我也能学会爱自己。我需要以某种方式打破这个局面。我需要以某种方式前进，但我需要指引……我需要你，明日香。

One more experience, one more entry in a diary, self-penned  
又一段经历，又一篇日记，自撰自录  
Yet another emotional suicide overdosed on sentiment and pride'  
又一次情感上的自杀，过量地沉浸在感伤与骄傲之中_

Those lyrics enter my mind as soon as I wake up. They're from a song called Script for a Jester's Tear by a band called Marillion. They were somewhat big in Germany in the eighties when my mother was growing up. She was a fan and one of the few things I inherited from her was her taste in music. While the other kids in my school were listening to the top ten of the day I was engaged in albums like Misplaced Childhood or Clutching at Straws. I never really understood what the songs meant. I only really started to learn recently but I always liked the way they sound. I liked the way the vocals were delivered and the poetic nature of them. I actually learned how to speak English so I could understand them more. Of course now I'm fluent in English and Japanese. Of course I am, I'm brilliant. It's probably a bit unusual for a girl of my age to be into that sort of music but it was one of the few connections I had with my mother that I retained.  
每当醒来，这些歌词便涌入脑海。它们出自乐队 Marillion 的歌曲《Script for a Jester's Tear》。八十年代，这支乐队在德国颇有名气，那时我母亲正值青春。她是他们的粉丝，而我从她那里继承的少数东西之一便是对音乐的品味。当同龄的孩子们还在听当红十大金曲时，我却沉浸在《Misplaced Childhood》或《Clutching at Straws》这样的专辑中。我从未真正理解这些歌曲的含义，直到最近才开始学习，但我一直喜欢它们的旋律。我喜欢人声的演绎方式和它们的诗意本质。实际上，我学习英语就是为了更好地理解这些歌曲。当然，现在我精通英语和日语。当然，我聪明绝顶。对于我这个年纪的女孩来说，喜欢这种音乐或许有些不寻常，但它是我与母亲之间为数不多的联系之一，我珍视至今。

I suppose when I look back on it those lyrics can be applied to me in a way. 'An emotional suicide overdosed on sentiment and pride.' My breakdown was a perfect example of that. I thought for certain I was unbeatable and unstoppable that when I was knocked back I thought I had lost everything. I spiralled downwards rejecting everything and not letting anyone help me. I was crying out internally for affection and crying out externally for everyone to leave me alone. By the time of the last Angels it was as the song says, _'Too late to re-stage the play, the game is over.'_  
回想起来，那些歌词在某种程度上似乎也适用于我。'情感上的自杀，过量服用了感伤与骄傲。'我的崩溃正是这一点的完美例证。我曾以为自己无可匹敌、势不可挡，但当被击倒时，我以为失去了所有。我急速下坠，拒绝一切，不让任何人帮助我。我在内心呼唤着爱，同时对外呼喊着让所有人离我远点。到了最后一场天使之战时，正如歌中所唱，'重演这场戏已太迟，游戏结束了。'

Except as I lie here on this beach I realize that the game isn't over. Not just yet, we've been given a second chance. Definitely in my case. I raise my hand slightly and stare at the bandage through my working eye. I say working eye, I'm not actually sure if I'm blind in my other one yet. It's bandaged and I daren't remove it yet, just in case. I actually saw a mirror when I was looking around earlier and promptly ran away from it. I can't look at myself yet. I need to stay strong to look after Shinji, so that when I lower my wall he can handle it.  
然而，当我躺在这片海滩上，我意识到游戏并未结束。至少现在还没有，我们得到了第二次机会。对我来说绝对是这样。我微微抬起手，透过我那只还能看见的眼睛凝视着绷带。我说是‘还能看见的眼睛’，其实我不确定另一只是否已经失明。它被绷带包扎着，我不敢现在就拆开，以防万一。之前我确实瞥见了一面镜子，随即就逃开了。我还不能面对自己的样子。我需要保持坚强，照顾好真嗣，这样当我放下心防时，他才能承受得住。

This is what I mean when I spoke about strength earlier. I'm all front and behind it lies a terrified girl who has never reached out to anyone. I desperately want to but I'm scared of doing so because I'm scared of how people will see me if I do. I need to reach out though eventually otherwise what happened before will end up happening again and I can't go through that again.  
这就是我之前谈到力量时的意思。我总是表现得坚强，但背后却藏着一个从未向任何人伸出过手的恐惧女孩。我非常渴望这样做，但又害怕这样做，因为我害怕别人会如何看待我。我需要最终伸出援手，否则以前发生的事情会再次发生，我无法再经历一次。

I'm looking across at Shinji, he's awake and sitting up looking out towards the sea. Every now and then he sniffs and wipes a tear from his eyes. I don't know if he knows I'm awake yet. If he does he hasn't made any indication. He's probably scared of me, about what I'll say. The malicious part of me thinks this is good, he should be afraid of me. He should be terrified of me because for a time I knew all his dirty little secrets. He should be terrified of me because he knows sooner or later we're going to have to discuss certain actions. He should be terrified of me because it was because of him I died.  
我望向真嗣，他醒着，坐起身来望向大海。时不时地，他会吸吸鼻子，擦去眼角的泪水。我不知道他是否知道我已经醒了。如果他知道，他也没有任何表示。他可能害怕我，害怕我会说什么。我内心恶毒的一面认为这样很好，他应该害怕我。他应该对我感到恐惧，因为有一段时间我了解他所有的肮脏小秘密。他应该对我感到恐惧，因为他知道迟早我们得讨论某些行为。他应该对我感到恐惧，因为正是因为他我才死去。

I don't want him to be terrified of me though. I don't want to be angry at him because I'm fed up of being angry. I'm fed up of hiding my feelings for him behind a wall of hatred. So instead I want to talk with him about it. I want to lay everything out on the table. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to make it easy for him. I want him to beg and plead for my forgiveness. I want him to cry his little eyes out in front of me. I want us to scream and yell at each other and tell each other everything the other did wrong. Then I want to break down and cry in front of him. I want to sob my little heart out until we both collapse in each other's arms.  
但我不想让他害怕我。我不想因为厌倦了生气而对他发火。我厌倦了在仇恨的墙后隐藏对他的感情。所以我想要和他谈谈。我想把一切都摊开来说。别误会，我不会让他轻易得到我的原谅。我要他乞求和恳求我的宽恕。我要他在我面前哭得泪眼汪汪。我们可能会互相大喊大叫，互相指出对方的错误。然后我想在他面前崩溃哭泣。我想痛哭流涕，直到我们相拥而泣。

Not yet though. It can wait.  
不过还没到时候。可以等等。

I sit up quickly causing him to flinch away from me. A little bit of colour has returned to his cheeks, not much but a bit. I can assume he hasn't been sick since I got him to eat earlier which is good. I guess my presence has helped that. I really am brilliant sometimes.  
我迅速坐起来，他因此畏缩了一下。他的脸颊上恢复了一点血色，虽然不多但有一些。我猜他自从我让他吃东西后就没再呕吐，这很好。我想我的存在对此有所帮助。有时候我真的很出色。

"Good morning Shinji… or afternoon… or evening… who even knows anymore."  
"早上好，真嗣……还是下午……或者晚上……谁还知道现在是什么时候呢。"

"Hi…"

His voice is barely above a whisper, this is going to get annoying before too long. No matter how bad he feels I'm not going to put up with having to ask him to repeat himself a bit louder each time he speaks.  
他的声音几乎只是耳语，这很快就会变得烦人。不管他感觉有多糟糕，我可不想每次他说话时都得让他再大声点。

"I've been thinking, we should probably move off of this beach. There are a few buildings still standing nearby we could probably take shelter in them."  
“我在想，我们或许应该离开这片海滩。附近还有几栋建筑屹立着，我们或许可以在那里避难。”

He looks out towards the sea and nods, "Yeah…"  
他望向大海，点点头，“是啊……”

I'm not annoyed yet but I can feel myself getting there. I give him another chance.  
我还没生气，但能感觉到自己快到那临界点了。我再给他一次机会。

"I think we could probably both do with looking for a change of clothes or something too."  
"我想我们可能都需要找些换洗的衣服或其他什么东西。"

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

My anger is now rising. One more chance.  
我的怒气正在上升。再给你一次机会。

"Are you up for travelling?"  
"你准备好旅行了吗？"

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

I lurch forward and grab the front of his shirt collar and pull him towards me. His deep brown eyes immediately look elsewhere. I can feel him shake at my touch and I immediately regret what I've done. I can't hold back though, I need him to snap out of this even if it's only until we've found somewhere. We need to survive until others come back, I don't plan on dying, again. I keep my voice stern but I don't yell.  
我猛地向前一冲，抓住他衬衫的前领，将他拉向我。他深褐色的眼睛立刻转向别处。我能感觉到他在我的触碰下颤抖，我立刻后悔了自己的行为。但我无法克制，我需要他清醒过来，哪怕只是在我们找到某个地方之前。我们需要活到其他人回来，我不打算再次死去。我保持声音严厉，但没有大喊。

"Look at me." “看着我。”

He doesn't so I pull him closer.  
他没有，于是我把他拉得更近。

"I said look at me Shinji."  
"我说看着我，真嗣。"

His eyes meet mine. They're so lost, so full of hurt. At this proximity I can see the redness around them from where he has been crying. I fix my gaze on him.  
他的目光与我相遇。那眼神如此迷茫，充满了痛苦。在这样的距离下，我能看到他因哭泣而红肿的眼眶。我凝视着他。

"I know this is difficult but we have to survive Shinji. I need you to take this seriously, even if it is only until we find somewhere. Do you understand me?"  
"我知道这很难，但我们必须活下去，真嗣。我需要你认真对待，哪怕只是直到我们找到一个安全的地方。你明白我的意思吗？"

He snaps to attention, "I... understand Asuka."  
他立刻集中精神，“我……理解明日香。”

"Good, because we need to survive."  
“很好，因为我们必须活下去。”

"I… don't…" “我……不明白……”

He looks at me and turns away mid-sentence. I already know what he is going to say and it fills me with rage. The bastard thinks he can just get away with saying something like that to me or even thinking that.  
他看着我，话说到一半就转过头去。我早已知道他要说什么，这让我怒火中烧。那混蛋以为他可以就这样对我说那种话，甚至那样想。

"You don't what? Need to survive? Don't deserve to survive? Do you want to die Shinji?"  
“你不什么？不需要生存？不配生存？你想死吗，真嗣？”

His eyes meet mine but he says nothing and I continue shouting.  
他的目光与我相遇，却一言不发，我继续吼道。

"Because I have died Shinji, I was torn apart and eaten alive by those monsters and I died. And I can tell you it fucking hurt. It wasn't some magical being pulled towards a tunnel and seeing my loved ones. It hurt and I'm not going to squander my second chance here on dying needlessly on some beach and I am certainly not going to let you die either and leave me alone here."  
"因为我已经死过一次了，真嗣，我被那些怪物撕碎并活活吃掉，我死了。我可以告诉你，那他妈的疼得要命。不是什么被拉向光隧看到亲人的魔法体验。那很疼，我不会在这里浪费第二次生命，毫无意义地死在某个海滩上，我也绝不会让你死去，留下我一个人在这里。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"So we're going to get up, we're going to find somewhere to take shelter in and find some supplies. We're going to find a change of clothing and we're going to live Shinji."  
"所以我们得站起来，我们要找个地方避难，找些补给。我们要找些换洗的衣服，我们要活下去，真嗣。"

"I… Yeah okay… sorry." "我… 嗯，好吧… 抱歉。"

I release my grip on his shirt collar and move my hands to rest on his shoulders. I'm aware of our proximity and I notice a new determination in his eyes. What I said seems to have had some effect, maybe he's realized I'm not going to abandon him.  
我松开了抓着他衣领的手，将双手放在他的肩膀上。我能感觉到我们之间的距离，注意到他眼中新的决心。我刚才说的话似乎产生了某种影响，也许他意识到我不会抛弃他。

"Now, what have you seen around here?"  
"那么，你在这附近看到了什么？"

"I… there's a small village about half an hour away."  
"我…大约半小时路程有个小村庄。"

"Good, outside of Tokyo-3 so it's not damaged?"  
"很好，不在第三新东京市范围内，所以没受损？"

He nods, "Yeah, there are a few shops there, only small ones though."  
他点头，"是的，那里有几家店铺，不过都是小店。"

"We'll go there then. Are you sure you're up to it?"  
“那我们就去那儿吧。你确定你能行吗？”

I'm sure he is but I have to make sure, I'm not sure of my own strength yet. Half an hour might not seem like a lot of time but if he falls ill on the way there I'm not sure I can carry him or drag him. I've been ignoring the pain in my arm since I returned and I still don't know the extent of my injuries. I have to make sure we're both going to be able to make this trip.  
“我相信他能行，但我必须确认一下，我还不完全了解自己的力量。半小时可能听起来不长，但如果他在路上病倒了，我不确定能否背得动他或拖着他走。自从回来后，我一直在忽视手臂的疼痛，仍不清楚自己伤得有多重。我必须确保我们俩都能完成这次旅行。”

He gives a small smile and nods.  
他微微一笑，点了点头。

"I'll… be alright." “我会……没事的。”

I'm still trying to stay stern with him but I can't help but feel my heart flutter a little bit when I see him smile. It's such a cute smile.  
我仍试图对他保持严肃，但看到他微笑时，我忍不住心跳加速。那笑容真是太可爱了。

"Good." "很好。"

All the anger is gone now. I admit I feel a little bit bad for yelling at him. I had to do it though, I need him to be focuses and it was one of the only ways to get through to him. To make up for it I pull him towards me again and wrap my arms around him letting him snuggle into my shoulder for some time. He seems a little bit hesitant at first but eventually I feel the warmth of his arms around me.  
所有的怒气现在都消失了。我承认对他大吼有点内疚。但那是必要的，我需要他集中注意力，那是唯一能让他明白的方法之一。为了弥补，我再次将他拉向我，用双臂环绕着他，让他依偎在我的肩上。起初他似乎有些犹豫，但最终我感受到了他臂膀的温暖环绕着我。

"Asuka… I… I'm sorry for everyt-"  
"明日香…我…我对不起你…"

I place my finger on his lips and shush him, "Not now Shinji, it can wait."  
我伸出手指轻按在他的唇上，示意他安静，"现在别说，真嗣，这事可以等。"

### Chapter 3 This town is sad...
Since I returned time has lost its meaning for me. I don't have my watch, my mobile phone died ages ago so all I have to go on is guessing. I can guess that I had been back for about two or three days before Asuka returned to me. I can guess that the small village was about half an hour away but as we take another step Asuka is turning to me with an angry look on her face.  
自从我回来后，时间对我来说已失去了意义。我没有手表，手机也早已没电，所以我只能靠猜测。我猜我回来大约有两三天后，明日香回到了我身边。我猜那个小村庄离我们大约有半小时的路程，但当我们再走一步时，明日香转过身来，脸上带着愤怒的表情。

"Are you sure it was only half an hour away? It feels like we've been walking for longer."  
“你确定只有半小时的路程吗？感觉我们走了更久。”

I shake my head and come clean, "I… thought it was half an hour away I guess… it was a bit longer."  
我摇摇头，坦白道：“我……我以为只有半小时的路程……可能稍微长一点。”

"Well I think I can see it at least, we should make it before nightfall at the very least."  
"嗯，我想我至少能看到它，我们最迟也该在天黑前赶到。"

Asuka hasn't started moving again, he gaze is fixed firmly on the buildings of the village. I take up a position beside her and look myself. This place managed to escape the wrath of Third Impact at least in some ways. I can make out cars stationary along the road leading into the village, I can see them stopped in the middle of the street. Overturned kids bicycles are there. My mouth suddenly turns very dry at the sight of it. Everything we see there is exactly as it was before humanity was taken away. I don't know if I'm prepared to see this.  
明日香还没有再次移动，她的目光紧紧锁定在村庄的建筑物上。我走到她身边，自己也看了看。这个地方至少在某种程度上逃过了第三次冲击的毁灭。我能看到沿着通往村庄的道路上停着汽车，街道中央也有车辆停着。翻倒的儿童自行车也在那里。看到这一幕，我的嘴巴突然变得非常干燥。我们所见的一切都和人类消失前一模一样。我不知道自己是否准备好面对这一切。

I've heard of this sort of thing happening in the world before. Entire cities have been evacuated and the people never returned turning them into a bizarre ghost town. Nature eventually reclaimed them. Only this is different, the people there were evacuated and relocated elsewhere. The people in this town, indeed in many towns across the world might not return. It's all my fault.  
我以前听说过世界上发生过类似的事情。整个城市被疏散，人们再也没有回来，变成了诡异的鬼城。自然最终会重新夺回它们。但这次不同，那里的人们被疏散并重新安置到别处。这个镇上的人，乃至世界各地许多城镇的人可能都不会回来了。这都是我的错。

I turn to look at Asuka's face and for the first time since she has returned I see fear on her face. She's gone pale I notice a trembling in her hands.  
我转头看向明日香的脸，自从她回来后，这是我第一次在她脸上看到恐惧。我发现她的脸色苍白，双手在颤抖。

She whispers, "Hey Shinji…"  
她低声说，"嘿，真嗣……"

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

"How are you feeling?" “你感觉怎么样？”

My stomach has a dull ache in it and I can feel myself trembling too. Instead of being honest I tell a lie, "I… I'm alright?"  
我的胃隐隐作痛，我能感觉到自己也在颤抖。我没有说实话，而是撒了个谎，“我……我没事？”

"You're lying." “你在撒谎。”

I nod and give a sheepish smile, "I'm scared…"  
我点点头，露出一个尴尬的微笑，“我害怕……”

"We should take a break."  
"我们应该休息一下。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

She points towards an area nearby and tells me to sit down while she hands me a bottle of water out of the backpack she's been carrying. The area she has picked has an obscured view of the village so none of us can see it. I realize I haven't asked her she is feeling, in fact I haven't asked her how she's feeling since she came back. It's all been her talking to and directing me. I've just assumed she is alright because she gives off that aura.  
她指向附近的一块地方，让我坐下，同时从她一直背着的背包里递给我一瓶水。她选的地方可以遮挡住村庄的视线，所以我们谁也看不到它。我意识到我还没问过她感觉如何，事实上，自从她回来后我都没问过她感觉怎么样。一直都是她在跟我说话，在指导我。我只是假设她没事，因为她散发着那种气息。

Yet I know otherwise. I know this is probably hurting her as much as it is me. I know it can't be easy for her to see that town, I know it can't be easy for her to have to drag me around like she is and I know it can't be easy for her to have to look at those bandages.  
然而我知道事实并非如此。我知道这可能对她和我一样痛苦。我知道看到那个小镇对她来说并不容易，我知道不得不像这样拖着我走对她来说并不容易，我知道不得不看着那些绷带对她来说并不容易。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Mm Hmm." "嗯哼。"

"Are you… alright?" "你…还好吗？"

It sounds like such a stupid question now that it has left my lips. It's just like the time she got attacked by the Angel in orbit and I asked the same thing. All I could do was stand there and ask her if she was alright. I'm an idiot, just as she always says.  
这话一出口，听起来真是蠢透了。就像那次她在轨道上被使徒袭击后，我也问了同样的问题。我只能站在那里，问她是否还好。我真是个白痴，正如她常说的那样。

I'm surprised to actually see her grinning, "You're an idiot. What do you think?"  
看到她居然在笑，我有些惊讶，"你真是个白痴。你以为呢？"

I lower my eyes to the ground and suddenly become engrossed with a stick and the various shapes I can draw in the ground with it as I give my reply, "You're far from alright."  
我垂下眼，目光落在地面上，突然对用一根棍子在地上画出的各种形状产生了浓厚兴趣，同时回答道，"你远未安然无恙。"

"Got it in one. I'm tired, cold and hungry. I've got a pain in my eye and running up my arm and I'm fed up of wearing this stupid Plugsuit. So yeah, far from alright but thank you for asking."  
"一语中的。我累坏了，又冷又饿。眼睛疼，手臂也疼，而且我受够了穿这件愚蠢的插头服。所以，远非没事，但还是谢谢你的关心。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"Don't apologize, I'm not mad at you for asking."  
"别道歉，我没因为你问而生气。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"What did I just tell you?"  
"我刚跟你说了什么？"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"You're doing that on purpose now aren't you?"  
"你现在是故意的，对吧？"

"No I jus… sorry." "不，我只是……对不起。"

I jump up suddenly as I feel her finger jab me sharply in the side. It doesn't hurt but it does tickle a lot. I immediately back away from her anticipating a further attack on my sides or anywhere. Almost instinctively I want to apologize again but I stop myself. I don't so it on purpose, it is just a reaction. I don't even know what I'm apologizing for half the time.  
我突然跳起来，感觉到她的手指狠狠地戳了我的侧边。虽然不疼，但确实很痒。我立刻从她身边退开，预料到她可能会继续攻击我的两侧或其他地方。几乎本能地，我想再次道歉，但还是忍住了。我不是故意的，这只是条件反射。很多时候，我甚至不知道自己在为什么道歉。

"Are you done?" "你好了吗？"

I nod keeping my hands firmly over both my sides just in case. "Yes."  
我点点头，双手紧紧按在身体两侧，以防万一。"是的。"

"Good. We should probably get this over and done with then shouldn't we?"  
"很好。那我们或许应该尽快解决这件事，不是吗？"

She stands up and looks in the direction of the village. There is a determination in her eyes that has replaced the fear I saw earlier. I don't know if it is genuine or an act but right now she looks so strong and so beautiful. I'm standing by her side again and I feel the dull ache in my stomach return as quickly as it went away.  
她站起身，朝村庄的方向望去。她的眼中闪现出一种决心，取代了之前我看到的恐惧。我不知道这是真实的还是表演，但此刻她看起来如此坚强，如此美丽。我再次站在她身边，感到那隐隐的胃痛如潮水般迅速回归。

I look across at her, she has already started walking forward so I follow. I take another drink of water to easy some of the dryness in my mouth. I'm looking at the trail of cars in the road again, I'm looking at the overturned bicycles and I'm imagining what this might have looked like a couple of days ago. Before I did what I did.  
我望向她，她已经开始向前走，于是我也跟上。我又喝了一口水，缓解口中的干燥。我再次注视着路上的汽车残骸，看着那些翻倒的自行车，想象着几天前这里可能的景象。在我做出那些事之前。

I wonder for a moment if ghosts are real. It certainly wouldn't be the strangest thing I've seen in the past year. Maybe there are ghosts in this town, still living their lives as if they never left. Of maybe it will just remain silent and empty forever. I'm not sure what scares me more.  
我一时好奇，鬼魂是否真的存在。这肯定不是过去一年里我见过的最奇怪的事。也许这个镇上还有鬼魂，依旧过着他们的生活，仿佛从未离开。又或许这里将永远保持沉默和空旷。我不确定哪种更让我害怕。

**...and we like it that way.  
...我们就是喜欢这样。**

I'll admit I didn't expect seeing that town to have such an effect on me as it did. Once I saw the trail of cars though, the kids' bikes and the streetlamps coming on it really hit me. We're truly alone right now. Me and Shinji are the only people in this place, maybe in the entire world and that's hard to comprehend.  
我得承认，我没想到再次看到那个小镇会对我产生如此大的影响。当我看到一排排汽车、孩子们的自行车和路灯亮起时，我真正感受到了。我们现在真的是孤立无援。我和真嗣是这个地方，也许是整个世界上仅有的人，这真的难以理解。

I'm confident people will come back eventually. It's just a matter of time, I mean me and Shinji came back but then again we're hardly like the others, they were pulled into it and me and Shinji well... like I said before I was the catalyst that provided the spark for Shinji to do what he did. I keep on thinking about that. It runs around in my head over and over again the same way that after the orbital Angel I couldn't stop thinking my identity as a pilot did.  
我相信人们最终会回来的。只是时间问题，我的意思是，我和真嗣回来了，但话说回来，我们与其他人并不相似，他们是被卷入其中的，而我与真嗣...就像我之前说的，我是促使真嗣采取行动的催化剂。我一直在思考这件事。它在我脑海中一遍又一遍地重复，就像在轨道天使事件后，我无法停止思考自己作为驾驶员的身份一样。

I helped to spark Third Impact, I told Shinji to do it and he complied. He came to me and me alone. He reached out to me because he had feelings for me but by that time I was so far gone I told him to fuck off and burn it all. I wonder what would have happened if I said otherwise? Would it have made a difference? Should I even be feeling guilty for what happened? It doesn't matter now. What is done is done we shouldn't question it anymore, we should push forward.  
我曾助燃了第三次冲击，我让真嗣去做，他照做了。他来找我，只找我一个人。他向我伸出手，因为他对我有感情，但那时我已经走得太远，我让他滚开，把一切都烧掉。我在想，如果我说了不同的话会怎样？会有所不同吗？我是否应该为发生的事情感到内疚？现在这些都不重要了。已经发生的事无法改变，我们不该再质疑，应该向前看。

Before long I realize we're in amidst the town itself. I'm trying hard to push the fear out of my mind and body. To pack it away into some corner like I am my other emotions. There is a voice in the back of my head telling me that could be a mistake but I don't care. I need to appear strong in front of Shinji. He's getting his strength and will to move on from me. I make a promise to myself that I'll let it all out later but for now we push forward.  
不久后，我意识到我们已身处小镇之中。我努力将恐惧从心和身体中驱散，把它像其他情绪一样塞到某个角落。脑海中有个声音告诉我这可能是错误的，但我不在乎。我需要在真嗣面前显得坚强。他从我这里获得力量和继续前进的意志。我对自己承诺，稍后再释放这一切，但现在我们必须向前推进。

Have you ever played a horror video game before in which the main character enters a town only to find it completely abandoned, yet you can't shake the feeling someone is watching you? That's similar to this right now. Except it's still daytime and there isn't any fog. Two facts I'm thankful for. This town is completely empty, left in exactly the same state it was when Third Impact started. In the streets I can see peoples accessories, bags and umbrellas and even glasses from where they were standing when it began. There are a few cars parked in the middle of the road, a few have hit one another. A child's bike lies overturned on the pavement.  
你有没有玩过那种恐怖电子游戏，主角进入一个小镇却发现它完全荒废了，但你总感觉有人在盯着你？现在的情况有点类似。只不过还是白天，也没有雾。这两个事实让我感到庆幸。这个小镇完全空无一人，保持着第三次冲击开始时的原样。街道上可以看到人们遗留的饰品、包和雨伞，甚至还有他们当时站立位置的眼镜。几辆车停在路中间，有些还撞在了一起。人行道上倒着一辆儿童自行车。

The first store we come across is a small family run hardware store. I turn to Shinji.  
我们遇到的第一个商店是一家小型的家庭经营五金店。我转向真嗣。

"Wait here." “在这里等我。”

I quickly go inside and grab a crowbar and a torch from inside the store. I'm not really sure if there are backup power generators in this town so the torch will be useful for the night time. The crowbar is in case we need to force anything open and I guess for protection too. From what I don't know but it makes me feel better. I emerge and hand the torch to Shinji and hold the crowbar in my uninjured hand.  
我迅速走进店内，抓起一根撬棍和一支火把。我不太确定这个镇上是否有备用发电机，所以火把在夜间会很有用。撬棍是为了万一需要强行打开什么东西，我想也是为了保护自己。虽然不知道会遇到什么，但这让我感觉更安心。我拿着火把出来，递给真嗣，而用未受伤的手握住撬棍。

"W-What's that for?" “这、这是干什么用的？”

"In case we need to break into anywhere of course."  
“当然是为了万一我们需要闯进什么地方。”

I don't tell him about it also being for protection. I don't want to worry him and besides the idea seems stupid. We're the only two people here so what do I need protection from?  
我也没告诉他这还为了保护自己。我不想让他担心，而且这想法听起来挺蠢的。这里只有我们两个人，我需要防备什么呢？

_'Shinji.' '真嗣。'_

I pause in my tracks rolling the answer to my question around in my head. Where the hell did that come from? What would I need protection from Shinji for? What is that poor kid going to do to the great Asuka Langley Sohryu?  
我停下脚步，脑海中反复琢磨着这个问题的答案。这到底是从哪儿冒出来的？我需要防备真嗣什么？那个可怜的孩子能对伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷做什么？

_'Try to choke you again?'  
'再试图掐死你？'_

I feel my free hand subconsciously reach up to my throat and I grow cold as I remember what had happened on the beach. I hadn't thought about it until now but what was he trying to do then? Why did he do that? I can still remember his eyes at that moment. They had gone, whatever was behind them wasn't Shinji anymore it was something else. It's been some time since then though, Shinji hasn't tried to do that again and he won't.  
我感到自由的那只手不自觉地摸向喉咙，回忆起海滩上的那一幕，我浑身发冷。直到现在我才想起，他当时到底想做什么？为什么要那样做？我仍能记得他那一刻的眼神，那背后不再是真嗣，而是别的什么。尽管那已过去一段时间，真嗣没有再尝试那样做，他也不会再那样做了。

_'Unless he is just biding his time, unless he can't control it.'  
'除非他在伺机而动，除非他无法控制自己。'_

My plugsuit suddenly feels unbearably tight around my throat. I need to get it off as soon as possible. I need to change into something else. The desolation of this town, the loneliness of it all is getting to me. It's making me have these thoughts. There is a small clothes store nearby, I can find something from in there.  
我的驾驶服突然感觉脖颈处紧得难以忍受。我需要尽快脱掉它。我需要换上别的衣服。这个小镇的荒凉，这一切的孤独感正在侵袭我。它让我产生了这些念头。附近有一家小服装店，我可以在那里找到些东西。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

I jump at the sound of his voice, slowly I turn to meet his eyes. "Y-Yeah?"  
我被他的声音吓了一跳，慢慢地转身迎上他的目光。"是-是的？"

"What... where are we going now?"  
“什么...我们现在要去哪儿？”

I point towards the clothes store, "Over there... I need to get changed into something else."  
我指向服装店，“在那边……我需要换件别的衣服。”

"Right." "对。"

I looked out of the window of our temporary home and saw the sun was starting to set. We had been fortunate in finding this place. It was a small one bedroom apartment over a grocery store, it was currently up for rent but it had been furnished so we already had access to a bed, sofa, and all basic amenities. We even found a back-up generator around the back so we had some limited power. We even had some running water which meant I could finally take a shower.  
我望向我们临时住所的窗外，看到太阳开始西沉。我们很幸运找到了这个地方。这是一间位于杂货店上方的小一居室公寓，目前正在出租，但已经配备了家具，所以我们已经有了床、沙发和所有基本设施。我们甚至在后面找到了一个备用发电机，因此有了一些有限的电力。我们甚至还有自来水，这意味着我终于可以洗个澡了。

Showering was a strange experience for me. It was the first time I actually saw how I looked since the fight. It was the first time I got a glimpse of my scarred body in a mirror. There were a number of them dotted around my body, all faded now as if they had been there for years.  
洗澡对我来说是一种奇怪的体验。这是我自那场战斗以来第一次真正看到自己的样子。这是我第一次在镜子里瞥见我伤痕累累的身体。我的身上散布着许多疤痕，现在都已褪色，仿佛它们已经存在多年。

I daren't look at my hand yet or reveal what is under the patch covering my eye.  
我还不敢看我的手，也没有揭开遮住眼睛的补丁，看看下面是什么。

I can smell something coming from the kitchen, Shinji is cooking in there. I'm not quite sure what he is cooking again our options are limited. A lot of the food isn't fit for use at the moment but I think he managed to find something. It seems this small town was serviced by a nearby farm so if it comes to it we could always grow our own food.  
我能闻到厨房里传来的味道，真嗣正在那里做饭。我不太确定他又在做什么，我们的选择有限。很多食物现在都不适合食用，但我想他还是找到了些什么。看来这个小镇是由附近的一个农场供应的，所以如果需要的话，我们也可以自己种食物。

I look at my old plugsuit thrown across the sofa. I'm not sure why I kept it when I got into these new clothes. I just couldn't bring myself to throw it away. I however made sure Shinji got rid of the old uniform he was wearing when he got his change of clothes. The thing was stained with blood, tears and other things. It was so silly how reluctant he was to take anything at first. I mean it is technically stealing because we expect people to return but at the moment survival takes priority right?  
我看着那件扔在沙发上的旧插头服。我不确定为什么在换上新衣服后还留着它。我就是无法让自己把它扔掉。不过，我确保让真嗣把他换衣服时穿的那件旧制服处理掉了。那件衣服上沾满了血迹、泪痕和其他东西。他一开始是多么不愿意接受任何东西，真是太傻了。我的意思是，这 technically 算是偷窃，因为我们期望人们会归还，但目前生存才是首要的，对吧？

So now I can see him from here at work in the kitchen. For the first time he actually looks happy, properly happy. I suppose cooking has taken his mind off of things for the moment and I'm happy to let him be that way. Especially after the thoughts that entered my head earlier today. I guess there is a part of me that is scared of Shinji. That's one of the differences between me and Shinji. He has seen me angry, he has seen me lose my temper in real life. He's watched as I've kicked things over, threatened him and other and punched walls. I'm not proud of any of that but he has seen it.  
现在，我能在工作时从这里看到他在厨房里的身影。他第一次看起来真的很开心，真正地开心。我想烹饪暂时让他忘却了烦恼，我很高兴他能这样。尤其是今天早些时候我脑海中闪过的那些念头之后。我想，我内心的一部分是害怕真嗣的。这就是我和真嗣之间的区别之一。他见过我发怒，见过我在现实生活中失控。他目睹过我踢翻东西，威胁他和其他人，甚至捶打墙壁。我并不以此为荣，但他确实见过。

The anger that lies in Shinji though, I've heard of it but I've never seen it. I heard about how he held NERV to ransom after he found out his friend Touji was the pilot of Unit 3, I heard about what he did when that Angel decapitated my Unit 02 and how after that he was absorbed into the Unit. I've only heard of those though, I never saw it and I've never seen him angry. Despite all the crap I and others gave him I've only seen him regress into himself. The first glimpse of that anger I saw was during Third Impact, in that bizarre world where our souls were the same. I saw what lies behind Shinji's eyes and I don't want to see it again. I'm scared of it and it isn't for my safety. I could hold my own against him but I'm scared for what it would do to him if it came to the surface.  
尽管我听说过真嗣内心的愤怒，但从未亲眼见过。我听说过他发现朋友东治成为三号机驾驶员后是如何挟持 NERV 的，也听说过当那个使徒斩断我的二号机头颅后，他是如何被吸收进机体的。这些我都只是听说，从未亲眼目睹，也从未见过他发怒。尽管我和其他人对他百般刁难，我看到的只是他退缩到自己的世界里。我第一次瞥见他的愤怒是在第三次冲击期间，在那个我们灵魂合一的奇异世界里。我看到了真嗣眼底隐藏的东西，再也不想看到第二次。我害怕那股力量，并非出于自身安全考虑。我能与他抗衡，但我害怕那股力量一旦爆发，对他会造成怎样的伤害。

It's not worth thinking about now though. I smells coming from the kitchen are too nice for dark thoughts right now. I should have told him more how much I appreciated his cooking when we lived with Misato. Not just because I couldn't cook and not just because Misatos cooking was beyond awful but because Shinji actually cared about what he did and it showed when it was put in front of me.  
不过现在想这些也没用。厨房飘来的香气太诱人，让人无暇顾及阴暗的思绪。我本该在和美里同住时多告诉真嗣我有多欣赏他的厨艺。不仅仅是因为我不会做饭，也不仅仅是因为美里的厨艺糟糕透顶，而是因为真嗣真的在乎他所做的事，这一点在我面前展现得淋漓尽致。

**Bed of Nails 钉床**

I'm finally starting to drop off when I hear the whimper from her in the bed next to me. I turn around and see her body twitch ever so slightly. I sit up to get a better look from my position on the floor.  
我正要昏昏入睡时，听到了她从旁边床上传来的呜咽声。我转过身，看到她的身体微微抽动。我坐起身，从地板上的位置更好地观察她。

"Mama…" “妈妈……”

Her body twitches again as her word hits me hard. When I first heard her calling for her mother in her sleep all those months ago I dismissed it. I mumbled that she was just a kid herself because she was always trying to seem so much older and more mature than any of us. I didn't know then what I know now though. I didn't know about her mother back then.  
随着她的话重重击中我，她的身体再次抽搐。几个月前第一次听到她在睡梦中呼唤母亲时，我并未在意。我咕哝着说她自己还是个孩子，因为她总是试图显得比我们任何人都更成熟。但那时我并不知道我现在所知道的。那时我并不了解她的母亲。

"No…. what are you doing…"  
"不…你在做什么…"

Her body moves again more violently this time. I watch on wondering if I should maybe do something. She speaks again only louder this time.  
她的身体这次更加剧烈地动了起来。我看着，不知道是否应该做些什么。她再次开口，这次声音更大了。

"Don't go Mama… no... no… no… I… I'll stop them, I'll do it just don't leave me…"  
"别走，妈妈…不…不…不…我…我会阻止他们的，我会做的，只是别离开我…"

Her body is moving around more now and she's yelling. I quickly jump up and go to the side of the bed. She's thrashing around and I wonder what I should do.  
她的身体现在动得更厉害了，还在大喊大叫。我迅速跳起来，走到床边。她正四处乱动，我不知道该怎么办。

"I don't want this… don't die! Please don't leave me all alone!"  
“我不想这样……别死！请不要丢下我一个人！”

My heart is racing in my chest, I gently nudge her should just in time to avoid one of her arms flailing towards me.  
我的心在胸口狂跳，我轻轻地推了一下她的肩膀，刚好躲开她挥向我的一只手臂。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Mama… I'll die with you! Just don't leave me!"  
"妈妈…我会和你一起死的！不要离开我！"

"Asuka… wake up!" "明日香…醒醒！"

I kneel on the bed and place both of my hands on her shoulders and shake her with more force.  
我跪在床上，双手放在她的肩膀上，用力摇晃她。

"Asuka! Please wake up." “明日香！请醒醒。”

"I…. I'll kill you all! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!"  
“我……我要杀了你们！我要杀了你们！我要杀了你们！”

"Asuka! Wake up, please!"  
“明日香！醒醒，求你了！”

Her body now thrashing about with more force I try to shake her one more time. I can feel her hands hitting against mine. It hurts but I don't care, I need to wake her up.  
她的身体现在更加剧烈地扭动着，我再次尝试摇晃她。我能感觉到她的手击打在我的手上。虽然很痛，但我不在乎，我必须让她醒来。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

Her eyes flicker open and she is looking directly up at me. Both of my hands are on her shoulders pinning her down onto the bed. I've got one knee on the bed and my mostly naked body is above hers. I also notice that in the wake of her thrashing around she's managed to throw the covers off of herself revealing her mostly naked body as well.  
她的眼睛闪烁着睁开，直直地看着我。我的双手按在她的肩膀上，将她固定在床上。我的一条膝盖抵在床上，赤裸的上身压在她的上方。同时，我也注意到在她挣扎的过程中，她已经把被子踢开了，露出了同样近乎赤裸的身体。

"What the hell are you doing? Get the hell off me!"  
"你到底在干什么？快从我身上滚开！"

I feel her push up against me and throw me off of her, almost immediately she gathers the sheets together to cover up her body and scrambles away from me.  
我感觉她用力推开我，迅速抓起被单遮住身体，然后慌忙远离我。

"You… You, what the hell were you doing! You… You pervert! You-"  
"你……你到底在干什么！你……你这个变态！你——"

"I-I-I… you were having a bad dream… I was trying to wake you…"  
"我-我-我……你正在做噩梦……我试图叫醒你……"

She looks at me for a moment. In the dim light of the room I see a look on her face of pure fear. I don't blame her, the last time I was stood over her while she was in a bed was that time in the hospital. No wonder she reacted like she did.  
她看了我一会儿。在房间昏暗的光线下，我看到她脸上满是纯粹的恐惧。我不怪她，上次我站在她床边时，她还在医院里。难怪她会有那样的反应。

"I… I was… having a bad dream…"  
"我……我正在……做噩梦……"

I nod, "Yeah… I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm… I'll sleep in the other room."  
我点点头，“嗯…如果吓到你了，我很抱歉。我…我会去另一个房间睡。”

I try to get up but I feel her grab my hand and pull me towards her, "No… its fine. I just… in the confusion… I thought you…"  
我试图起身，但她抓住我的手，把我拉向她，“不…没关系。我只是…在混乱中…我以为你…”

I know exactly what she thought. I don't really know what to say at this point. I still feel absolutely sick at the thought of it, I don't even know how she can be civil with me. I violated her in one of the worst ways possible and she knows all about it.  
我完全明白她当时的想法。此刻我真不知道该说什么。一想到那事，我仍感到极度不适，甚至不知道她怎么能如此平静地面对我。我在最糟糕的方式上侵犯了她，而她对此一清二楚。

"Did I… wake you?" "我…吵醒你了吗？"

I shake my head, "No, I couldn't sleep as it is… I was thinking."  
我摇摇头，"没有，我本来就睡不着…我在思考。"

It was half true. The real reason I couldn't get to sleep is because the floor is so uncomfortable. I offered to sleep on the sofa but Asuka insisted we share the room because of safety in numbers. So I elected to sleep on the floor. She didn't seem to have a problem with me sharing the bed as long as we kept a suitable distance but I didn't feel it was appropriate.  
这话半真半假。我睡不着真正的原因是地板太不舒服了。我提出睡沙发，但明日香坚持我们共用房间，因为人多安全。所以我选择睡地板。她似乎不介意我同床共枕，只要保持适当距离，但我感觉那样不合适。

"Oh yeah… what about?" "哦，是吗…什么方面？"

"Just… everything I guess."  
"就是…所有事情吧，我想。"

I hear her laugh, "Idiot."  
我听到她笑了，"傻瓜。"

I feel something tickle the top of my hand and realize her bandages have become loosened in the melee just now.  
我感觉手背上有东西轻轻拂过，意识到她的绷带在刚才的混乱中松开了。

"Asuka, your bandages…" “明日香，你的绷带……”

"I know, they've become loose. Noticed it when I was in the shower earlier."  
“我知道，松了。之前洗澡的时候就发现了。”

"Do you… do you want me to check the supplies for any new bandages."  
"你…你要我检查一下补给品里有没有新的绷带吗？"

"Not now. Can you go and get me some water though please…"  
"现在不用。不过你能去帮我弄点水来吗？"

**A Nightmare to Remember… 一段难忘的噩梦…**

I'm sure I see Shinji smile as he nods, I watch him curiously as he leaves the room. I wonder if he has realized I can see pretty much all of him in those boxer shorts of his. After that nightmare it's something pleasant to look at. Shinji actually has a fairly well defined body. I suppose being an Evangelion pilot he has to, his shoulders are just that little bit broader than they seem when he has clothes on. His stomach is smooth and although skinny looks comfortable enough to sleep on. Lower than that, let's just say I'm struggling to not let my mind wander right now.  
我确信我看到真嗣点头时笑了，我好奇地看着他离开房间。我想知道他是否意识到我几乎能透过他的平角裤看到他的全身。经历了那个噩梦之后，这成了令人愉快的景象。真嗣实际上有着相当健美的身材。我想作为 EVA 驾驶员，他必须如此，他的肩膀比穿着衣服时显得更宽一些。他的腹部平坦，虽然瘦削但看起来很适合躺着睡觉。再往下，这么说吧，我现在正努力不让自己的思绪飘得太远。

Pretty rich stuff considering I just called him a pervert as well and here I am thinking about what I'd like to do to him.  
考虑到我刚刚还骂他是变态，而现在我却在这里想着对他做些什么，真是相当讽刺。

Anything to get the images from the nightmare out of my head I suppose. I'm even tempted to take advantage of his guilt for a moment, maybe get him to reveal a little bit more to me in exchange for him getting to see me. I'm better than that though and besides there are issues we need to iron out before we could even think of anything like that. So for now sneak glances and dirty thoughts are all I'll have.  
我想任何事情都比让噩梦中的影像从我脑海中消失要好。我甚至想利用他的内疚一会儿，也许让他为了看到我而向我透露更多。但我比那更好，而且在我们考虑那种事情之前，还有许多问题需要解决。所以现在，偷偷的目光和肮脏的想法就是我所拥有的一切了。

The nightmare, it was a typical one for me. I suffer from them quite a lot although I don't think I've ever yelled out in my sleep because of them. It was about Mama of course. They always are, about how she was taken away from me. This one had nine special guest stars in there as well just to add to my psychological torture. It just wasn't enough for me to see my mother die again, this time I had to watch her be impaled by the same lances that got me. I probably won't get much more sleep tonight. I had already struggled to get to sleep because I felt guilty that Shinji was sleeping on the floor, guilt on top of nightmarish images mean I may as well just get up now.  
那个噩梦，对我来说很典型。我经常做噩梦，尽管我从没因为它们在睡梦中大喊大叫。当然，梦里是关于妈妈的。总是关于她如何被夺走。这次还有九个特别嘉宾客串，只是为了增加我的心理折磨。仅仅再次目睹母亲死去还不够，这次我还得看着她被同样的矛刺穿，就像我一样。今晚我可能睡不了多久了。我本来就因为感到内疚而难以入睡，因为真嗣睡在地板上，内疚加上噩梦的画面，我不如现在就起床。

Still holding up the covers I reach over and pick up the shirt I discarded earlier in the night and put it on. Just in time for Shinji to return with water, he's got something else in his hand as well. The torch and a first aid box, I thought I told the idiot to not do anything with the bandages. I don't want to look at it, I'm not ready.  
我仍然抓着被子，伸手拿起晚上早些时候丢弃的衬衫穿上。正好真嗣带着水回来了，他手里还拿着别的东西。手电筒和急救箱，我记得我告诉过那个傻瓜不要动绷带。我不想看，我还没准备好。

"Shinji I told you…" “真嗣，我告诉过你……”

"Let me look, please." "让我看看，好吗？"

"I-I can't…" "我-我不能……"

His touch is so soft and gentle as he takes my bandaged hand. "Asuka, you need these changing. I've been bandaged up before. Please, let me."  
他的触碰如此轻柔，当他接过我包扎的手时。“明日香，你需要更换这些绷带。我以前也包扎过。请让我来吧。”

I know he is right, god damn it all he is right but I just can't look at it. I don't want to see the scars. I've already seen the smaller scars dotted around my body when I got out of the shower earlier and I felt like crying. I'm not ready for this yet. Like I'm going to tell him that.  
我知道他是对的，该死的，他就是对的，但我就是无法面对。我不想看到那些伤疤。早些时候洗完澡后，我看到自己身上散布着较小的伤疤，那一刻我几乎要哭了。我还没准备好面对这些。就像我打算告诉他那样。

"No, just leave it." “不，就这样吧。”

His grip tightens on me, "Asuka!"  
他紧紧抓住我，“明日香！”

Damnit when did he suddenly develop this backbone. I snarl back at him. "Fine! Do what you have to do, but don't think I'm going to co-operate with you in anyway."  
该死，他什么时候突然有了这股骨气。我朝他咆哮回去。"好啊！你想做什么就去做，但别指望我会跟你合作。"

I close my eyes and look away pretending I'm in a mood with him. I suppose it's one way of us both getting what we want. He gets to change the godforsaken dirty bandages like they need to be and I get the comfort of not having to look. He wordlessly works at my bandages taking off the old ones. His touch sends a shiver through me, it's so gentle. I don't know if that is just him or if he is going to extra effort because of my injuries.  
我闭上眼睛，转过头去，假装在生他的气。我想这是我们各取所需的一种方式。他可以更换那些该死的脏绷带，就像它们需要的那样，而我则可以不必直视，得到一丝安慰。他默默地为我更换绷带，取下旧的。他的触碰让我浑身一颤，那么轻柔。我不知道这是他的本性，还是因为他考虑到我的伤势而格外用心。

I daren't look, it's too soon but I am intrigued.  
我不敢看，还太早，但我感到好奇。

"Is it bad?" "这样不好吗？"

I get no response for him, instead all I get is him leaning in and putting the finishing touches on sorting out the new bandage on my arm.  
他没有回应我，只是凑近过来，细心地为我手臂上的新绷带做最后的整理。

"Shinji I asked you a question, is it bad?"  
"真嗣，我问你话呢，这样不好吗？"

I feel his hand leave mine and I finally turn around to see him. I look at my bandaged hand. The bandages aren't as high up as the ones that were on me before. I guess the damage didn't quite go up that high. I notice Shinji is on his knees on the bed, he's struggling not to cry again.  
我感觉他的手从我的手中抽离，终于转过身去看他。我看着自己包扎好的手。绷带没有之前包得那么高。我想伤害并没有达到那么高的程度。我注意到真嗣跪在床上，他正努力不让自己再次哭泣。

I don't mean to but I sigh, "Shinji, what's wrong?"  
我不由自主地叹了口气，“真嗣，怎么了？”

"I…"

He sniffs and wipes a tear away from his eye, "I'm sorry Asuka… it's my fault you're like this."  
他吸了吸鼻子，擦去眼角的泪水，“对不起，明日香……这都是我的错，你才会变成这样。”

Ah of course, he's taken one look at the scars and is blaming himself. I guess it's only natural because in some ways it is his fault. He didn't exactly try to do anything while I was fighting the Eva Series. He took one look at his Evangelion in the Bakelite and gave up. He knew his mother could hear him in there and he didn't even try to do anything.  
啊，当然，他一看到那些伤疤就开始自责了。我想这很自然，因为在某种程度上确实是他的错。在我与 EVA 系列战斗时，他并没有真正尝试做些什么。他只是看了一眼封在石膏中的 EVA，就放弃了。他知道他母亲能在里面听到他的声音，但他连尝试都没有尝试。

Am I angry about what happened? Of course I am, that's why I just had a nightmare involving those nine bastards but I don't blame Shinji for it. I blame NERV, I blame SEELE and I blame myself for not seeing it coming. Shinji, well maybe I'm a little bit annoyed that he didn't try something. It definitely isn't his fault though.  
我对发生的事情感到愤怒吗？当然，这就是为什么我刚刚做了一个关于那九个混蛋的噩梦，但我并不怪真嗣。我怪 NERV，怪 SEELE，也怪我自己没有预见到。至于真嗣，也许我有点恼火他没有尝试做些什么。但这绝对不是他的错。

"You're such an idiot." "你真是蠢到家了。"

"…yeah…" "……是啊……"

"Look I don't want to discuss this now, I'm tired. Just let me know… was the scarring that bad?"  
"听着，我现在不想讨论这个，我累了。你告诉我……疤痕真的很严重吗？"

To my surprise he shakes his head, "There was barely anything there, it was like your che-"  
出乎意料，他摇了摇头，“那里几乎什么都没有，就像你的胸——”

I raise my eyebrow as he suddenly stops himself. I'm glad you got a good look at my chest Shinji, enough to notice the scarring in this light. I'll let it slip for now considering I just spent snuck a look at his ass after all. I am however surprised to hear the scarring isn't that bad. Considering how many bandages were there when I came back I expected it to be serious.  
他突然打住，我挑了挑眉。真高兴你在我胸前看得那么仔细，新二，在这种光线下还能注意到疤痕。既然我刚刚偷瞄了他的屁股，这次就放过你。不过，听到疤痕没那么严重，我还是挺惊讶的。考虑到我回来时缠了那么多绷带，我本以为会很严重。

"Well that's something I guess. Let's get some sleep shall we?"  
“嗯，那倒是件好事。我们睡会儿吧，好吗？”

He nods and gets off the bed moving back over to his makeshift set up on the floor. I can't help it but I make sure I get another good look at him. Happy thoughts before bedtime. I lie back and close my eyes and hear him shuffle about on the floor trying to get comfortable.  
他点点头，从床上下来，回到地板上的临时铺位。我忍不住又多看了他一眼。睡前的美好思绪。我躺下闭上眼睛，听到他在地板上窸窸窣窣地调整姿势，试图让自己舒服些。

A few minutes pass and more shuffling. It really can't be comfortable down there for him. I never really thought of that when he said he'd sleep on the floor. I move across from the middle of the double bed onto one side and prop myself up on one hand and call over to him.  
几分钟过去了，窸窸窣窣的声音还在继续。他在那下面肯定不舒服。当他提出要睡地板时，我从未真正考虑过这一点。我从双人床中间挪到一边，用手撑起身体，朝他喊道。

"Shinji, get in." “真嗣，上来吧。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"The bed, put a shirt on and get in. I'm not putting up with you shuffling about like that all night. It's keeping me awake."  
"上床，穿上衬衫躺好。我可受不了你整晚这样拖拖拉拉的。吵得我都睡不着了。"

"I… I can sleep in the other room if you want."  
"我……我可以睡在别的房间，如果你愿意的话。"

"No! We sleep in the same room. Just do as I say and get in will you and hurry up before I change my mind."  
"不行！我们得睡同一个房间。照我说的做，快点躺下，不然我可要改变主意了。"

Slowly he stands up and throws on one of the shirts I got for him and moves over to the side of the bed. He's hesitant but slowly he gets in and annoys me further by balancing himself as far away from me as possible, right on the edge of the stupid thing.  
他缓缓站起身，套上我给他买的一件衬衫，挪到床边。他犹豫不决，但还是慢慢躺下，为了尽可能远离我，他几乎只靠在床的边缘，这让我更加恼火。

"You are such an idiot Shinji, for the love of god."  
“真是个白痴，新司，看在上帝的份上。”

I wrap an arm around him and pull him towards me, I can feel him struggle against it but I tighten my grip on him. I shuffle myself forward until I'm close to pressing my chest into his back and relax my grip ever so slightly.  
我伸出一只手臂搂住他，将他拉向我，我能感觉到他在挣扎，但我收紧了手臂。我向前挪动，直到我的胸膛几乎贴上他的背，然后稍稍放松了些力道。

"Good night Shinji." "晚安，真嗣。"

I close my eyes and thankfully the nightmares don't return.  
我闭上眼睛，庆幸噩梦没有再次袭来。

### Chapter 4 What a brave, brave girl…  
I'm in a darkened room, in front of me is a hospital bed lit only by one spotlight. The rest of the room is silent except for the rhythmic beeping of the machines hooked up to the beds occupant. I feel like I've been in this room before, as I walk towards the bed I see Shinji lying there. His chest moving up and down slowly but his eyes closed.  
我身处一间昏暗的房间，面前是一张仅被一束聚光灯照亮的医院病床。房间的其他部分寂静无声，只有连接着床上人的机器发出有节奏的哔哔声。我感觉自己似乎曾来过这个房间，当我走向病床时，看到真嗣躺在那里。他的胸膛缓慢地起伏，但双眼紧闭。

I don't remember this, what happened to him? Why is he here lying in this bed. Why am I here? Coming up to Shinji's bedside like this, even entering his room. This isn't me! I never did this, every time he was here I'd wait outside avoiding stepping into the room and waiting for the chance to run home. I hate hospitals. They make me feel sick. The smell, the noise and the people. So I wonder why I'm here now and again I wonder why he is lying in this bed. I can't remember and this frustrates me.  
我不记得这些，他发生了什么？为什么他躺在这里的床上。我为什么在这里？这样走到真嗣的床边，甚至进入他的房间。这不是我！我从未这样做过，每次他在这里时，我都会等在外面，避免踏入房间，等待机会跑回家。我讨厌医院。它们让我感到恶心。气味、噪音和人群。所以我不知道为什么我现在在这里，我又一次想知道为什么他躺在这张床上。我不记得了，这让我感到沮丧。

Did I fail to protect him like I said I would? No I can't have done! I promised myself I wouldn't fail again, I promised myself I wouldn't get things wrong. So why the hell is he here?  
难道我没有像我承诺的那样保护他吗？不，我不可能失败！我发誓自己不会再失败，我发誓自己不会再犯错。那么他到底为什么会在这里？

I'm now standing right next to his bedside, I suddenly get the urge to talk to him. I don't know why, it's not like he can hear me but here I go.  
我现在就站在他的床边，突然有种想和他说话的冲动。我不知道为什么，他不可能听见我，但我还是开始了。

"Hey Shinji…" “嘿，真嗣……”

"I… I don't know what happened but…"  
“我……我不知道发生了什么，但是……”

What the hell do I say now? 'You'll be alright', 'You'll get through this'?  
我现在到底该说什么？‘你会没事的’，‘你会挺过去的’？

"You'll recover, you always do! You're the invincible Shinji! Just… make sure you wake up…"  
“你会康复的，你总是能挺过来！你是无敌的真嗣！只是…一定要醒来…”

I bite the bottom of my lip and realize I'm actually trembling. Why the hell am I shaking so much? What am I scared of?  
我咬了咬下唇，发现自己竟然在颤抖。我他妈为什么抖得这么厉害？我在害怕什么？

_'Abandonment… he's going to die and abandon you. He's too weak and you'll be left on your own.'  
'抛弃…他会死去并抛弃你。他太弱了，你会被独自留下的。'_

No, that isn't true. Shinji is strong he just shows it in a different way.  
不，那不是真的。真嗣很强，只是他表现的方式不同。

_'Bullshit… he's weak and you know it. You're just carrying around dead weight right now. You're just scared of being on your own but you know the truth. You're better off on your own. You don't need a useless little boy like him.'  
'胡说八道…他很弱，你心知肚明。你现在只是拖着个累赘。你只是害怕独自一人，但你明白真相。你独自一人会更好。你不需要像他这样的无用小男孩。'_

"No… you're wrong. He won't abandon me and people will come back. We'll survive."  
“不……你错了。他不会抛弃我，人们会回来的。我们能挺过去。”

_'Will they? Look at your world so far. How long has it been? Two weeks in and no one else has returned. Face it you're both alone and Shinji is going to die.'  
“他们会吗？看看你迄今为止的世界。已经多久了？两周过去了，还没有其他人回来。面对现实吧，你们俩都孤立无援，真嗣会死的。”_

"Shut up!" "闭嘴！"

_'He'll die and there is nothing you can do about it. Don't you understand yet? You can't do anything. You never have been able to. You've just coasted along.'  
“他会死，而你对此无能为力。你还不明白吗？你什么都做不了。你从来就没做到过。你只是一直在随波逐流。”_

"Shut up! That isn't true!"  
"闭嘴！那不是真的！"

_'You're just like him! Weak and pathetic, rejecting others because of your own fear of being alone. You're the same!'  
'你就像他一样！软弱无能，因为害怕孤独而拒绝他人。你也是一样的！'_

"No! I'm not scared… I'm not weak and neither is he!"  
"不！我不害怕……我不软弱，他也不软弱！"

_'Liar.' '骗子。'_

I'm shaking now and I've moved away from the bed. I step forward again frantically and grab onto Shinji's shoulder. I'm not weak. I'm not! I swear, I know I can be strong and I know he isn't going to leave me. I just, I need him to wake up now! We need to leave this place.  
我现在浑身颤抖，已经远离了床。我再次慌乱地向前迈步，抓住了真嗣的肩膀。我不弱。我不是！我发誓，我知道我能变得坚强，我知道他不会离开我。我只是，我现在需要他醒来！我们必须离开这个地方。

"Shinji, listen to me you have to wake up!"  
“真嗣，听我说，你必须醒过来！”

I shake him and get no response.  
我摇晃他，却毫无反应。

"Please Shinji don't… just don't leave me here. I'm scared okay? I can't be alone."  
“求你了，真嗣，别……别把我留在这里。我害怕，好吗？我不能一个人。”

I shake again, his heart rate increases a bit but I still get nothing.  
我又摇了一次，他的心跳加快了一点，但我还是什么都没得到。

"Look I don't care, just wake up. I need you Shinji, wake up. Just apologize to me like you always do, cry or blush or I don't know just… WAKE UP!"  
"听着，我不在乎，快醒醒。我需要你，真嗣，醒过来。像往常一样向我道歉，哭也好，脸红也罢，或者随便什么……快醒过来！"

I shake one more time pulling him forward and without meaning to I pull the sheet entirely off of him. In shock I quickly place him back down on the bed and step away. What the hell was I thinking? I realize my breathing has slowed somewhat and my right hand is trembling. I'm looking his naked body up and down.  
我又一次摇晃他，无意中将他身上的床单完全扯了下来。我震惊地迅速将他放回床上，并后退一步。我到底在想什么？我意识到自己的呼吸已经放缓，右手在颤抖。我上下打量着他赤裸的身体。

"Sh-Shinji…" "真-真嗣……"

I feel a warm sensation in my lower body and I can feel my hand instinctively going in that direction. It's slowly undoing the button on my jeans. I'm drawn to his body, fixated on one particular part. I feel myself gasp as my hand enters my underwear.  
我感到下半身涌起一阵暖意，手不由自主地朝那个方向伸去。它缓缓解开了我的牛仔裤扣。我被他的身体吸引，目光紧锁在某一处。当我的手探入内裤时，我不禁倒吸一口气。

For a moment I recall a past conversation.  
有那么一刻，我想起了过去的对话。

_"You make me sick!" “你让我恶心！”_

_"Why, because I'm just like you?"  
“为什么，就因为我像你一样？”_

I feel sick, I'm so fucked up.  
我感觉恶心，我真是糟糕透了。

**…Never lied before… ……从未撒过谎……**

I suddenly wake up and I realize thankfully that I'm in the apartment bedroom. Shinji is lying next to me peacefully and on his side. My entire body is covered in sweat and there is a throbbing in my right hand. The last few moments of my dream are replaying in my head over and over again. I guess certain things have been playing on my mind for the last few days. We both need to have that discussion about that happened leading up to Third Impact but I keep on putting it off.  
我突然惊醒，庆幸地发现自己躺在公寓的卧室里。真嗣安详地躺在我身边，侧着身子。我全身被汗水浸透，右手隐隐作痛。梦境的最后几幕在我脑海中反复回放。我想，最近几天有些事情一直萦绕在心头。我们确实需要谈谈导致第三次冲击发生的那件事，但我一直在拖延。

I guess I've been rolling that phrase around in my head a lot too. It was a conversation that occurred during Instrumentality. In which I called him out again, I told him he made me sick only for him to tell me that he was just like me. That was the moment my wall crumbled down around me. It was true and I wondered that if our role had been reversed in certain situations would I have acted the same?  
我想我也一直在脑海中反复琢磨那句话。那是在人类补完计划期间的一次对话。我再次向他发难，告诉他他让我感到恶心，而他却告诉我，他和我一样。那一刻，我的防线彻底崩溃。这是真的，我不禁思考，如果我们的角色在某些情况下互换，我会做出同样的选择吗？

Of course I would, I already did. When Shinji finally emerged from the Eva after a month of being in there he was naked. I remember being entranced by his body. Fixated on it and burnt the image into my mind. I remember myself staggering away to the locker room, locking the door and getting myself off there and then. I even had to bite down on my other hand to stop myself from screaming out as I brought myself to orgasm.  
当然会的，我已经这么做了。当真嗣终于从 Eva 里出来，经过一个月的封闭后，他是赤裸的。我记得自己被他的身体深深吸引，无法移开视线，将那影像烙印在脑海中。我记得自己踉跄着走向更衣室，锁上门，就在那里自慰。我甚至不得不咬住另一只手，以防自己在高潮时尖叫出声。

I'm just as bad, I'm just as fucked up as Shinji. The one difference is at least he's ready to admit and feel bad about it. I'm just tucking it away and ignoring it hoping it'll go away while he is actually remorseful. The sad thing is Shinji has seen it, he knows about it and he continues to love me.  
我和他一样糟糕，一样扭曲。唯一的区别是，至少他愿意承认并为此感到难过。我只是把它藏起来，忽视它，希望它会消失，而他真的感到悔恨。可悲的是，真嗣已经看到了，他知道这一切，却依然爱我。

This is why I can't talk to him about it because I know I'll yell, and I'll scream and I'll cry at him and lay into him. He'll take it all and refuse to call me out on my bullshit and behaviour. He'll continue to love the detestable person known as Asuka Langley Sohryu and I don't deserve any of it.  
这就是为什么我不能和他谈这件事，因为我知道我会对他大喊大叫，哭泣，责备他。他会默默承受一切，不会指责我的胡言乱语和行为。他会继续爱着那个可憎的人——惣流·明日香·兰格雷，而我根本不配得到这些。

**…such a plain deceit… …如此平凡的欺骗…**

It's been two weeks and once again I find myself staring out across the red sea looking for any trace that someone, anyone might have come back. As it has been for the past fourteen days only me and Asuka are here. There is nothing, no footsteps, no camps and no trace.  
已经过去两周了，我又一次发现自己凝视着红色的海洋，寻找着任何可能有人回来的迹象。正如过去十四天一样，只有我和明日香在这里。什么都没有，没有脚印，没有营地，也没有痕迹。

_"Anyone can return to their human form, as long as they are able to imagine themselves within their own heart."  
“任何人都可以变回人形，只要他们能在心中想象自己。”_

Those were some of the last words my mother spoke to me before I returned to this beach. I was here for two days before Asuka returned. Are we the only two living beings to imagine ourselves in our own hearts then? Does no one else feel the way we did about those false worlds presented to them? Are they really content with living within a false reality lacking pain but also lacking in joy?  
那是我母亲在我重返这片海滩前对我说的最后几句话。我在这里待了两天，直到明日香回来。难道只有我们两个在心中想象自己存在吗？其他人难道不曾对我们所呈现的那些虚假世界感到同样的情感吗？他们真的满足于生活在缺乏痛苦但也缺乏欢乐的虚假现实中吗？

"No trace huh?" “没有痕迹吗？”

I shake my head at the sound of her voice, "… Nothing…"  
我听到她的声音，摇了摇头，“……什么都没有……”

"Well no use getting upset over it, tomorrow is another day."  
"唉，为这事烦恼也没用，明天又是新的一天。"

She sounds upbeat, enthusiastic and I don't know how. We're the only two people here, we're fending for ourselves and we don't know how long this is going to go on for. What if no one does come back? What if everyone decides their lives were so shit they are happy to live in a false reality? What if for some reason they can't come back, what if my mother lied to me? It wouldn't be the first time. My entire life was a series of lies told by my mother and father and numerous other people.  
她的声音听起来很乐观，充满热情，我不知道她是怎么做到的。这里只有我们两个人，我们得自力更生，也不知道这种情况会持续多久。如果没有人回来怎么办？如果每个人都觉得自己的生活太糟糕，宁愿活在虚假的现实中怎么办？如果出于某种原因他们无法回来，如果我母亲对我撒谎怎么办？这已经不是第一次了。我的一生都是由母亲、父亲和许多其他人编织的一系列谎言。

I'm not even upset anymore, I don't even feel sick about it anymore I just feel. Empty. I clench my hand into a fist and hit it off of the rock I'm sat on. The pain instantly tells me that I've made a mistake and Asuka grabs me wrist.  
我甚至不再感到愤怒，也不再对此感到恶心，我只是感到空虚。我握紧拳头，朝我坐着的岩石上打去。疼痛立刻告诉我这是个错误，而明日香抓住了我的手腕。

"Idiot, what the hell are you thinking?"  
"白痴，你到底在想什么？"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

I sigh, "I just don't understand it… why has no one else returned yet?"  
我叹了口气，"我只是不明白……为什么其他人还没回来？"

"Well we don't know that for certain."  
"嗯，我们也不能确定这一点。"

"There's nothing down there Asuka, it's… what if they can't… I, what if I made it so they can't."  
"下面什么都没有，明日香，这……如果他们不能……我，如果我让他们不能。"

"You're really dense sometimes Shinji. Think about it for a moment will you. How many people were there on this planet?"  
"你有时候真的很迟钝，真嗣。稍微想一想好吗。这个星球上有多少人？"

I don't know the answer to that. Something that becomes quite clear when she looks at the blank expression on my face. All I get from her is a sigh.  
我不知道这个问题的答案。这一点在她看到我茫然的表情时变得相当明显。她只是叹了口气。

"Let's say the entire world's population was at about three billion when Third Impact happened and every soul in the world was drawn into it. So minus us that's two billion nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety eight people left to return, from around the entire world. Now think about how many people were in Tokyo-3 and its surrounding areas at the time it happened. The entire area had been evacuated hadn't it? Do you see my point?"  
"假设第三次冲击发生时全球人口约为三十亿，世界上每个人的灵魂都被卷入其中。那么减去我们，还有二十九亿九千九百九十九万九千九百九十八人需要回归，来自世界各地。现在想想第三次冲击发生时，东京-3 及其周边地区有多少人。整个地区不是已经疏散了吗？你明白我的意思吗？"

I don't see her point, in fact the numbers she is reeling off just gives me a headache so I shake my head.  
我不明白她的意思，事实上她列举的数字只是让我头疼，所以我摇了摇头。

"Urgh, what I'm trying to say is that we aren't the only place affected. This got everyone, so any number of people could have returned by now but in different parts of the world. Millions could have come back by now. Europe, America, Africa, all of those people could have returned and we wouldn't know about it yet because we're stuck here in this small town with a power generator and no way of contacting the world beyond ourselves."  
"呃，我想说的是，我们并不是唯一受影响的地方。这影响到了所有人，所以现在可能有无数人已经回归，只是分布在世界的不同地方。数百万可能已经回来了。欧洲、美洲、非洲，所有那些人可能已经回归，而我们还不知道，因为我们被困在这个小镇上，只有发电机，无法与外界联系。"

I can see her point now, I hadn't thought about it like that.  
我现在明白她的意思了，我之前没这么想过。

"I mean what were you expecting to happen? Three billion people just wash up on the beach?"  
“我是说，你当时期待会发生什么？三十亿人突然冲上沙滩？”

I look at her blankly and she narrows her gaze at me.  
我茫然地看着她，她则眯起眼睛盯着我。

"You were expecting that weren't you?"  
"你是不是以为会是那样？"

"N-Not quite like that…" "不，没完全像那样……"

"You're an idiot." "你真是个傻瓜。"

I actually laugh. Her words have calmed me somewhat. I guess we don't really know the rules of this new world yet. We don't know what lies beyond our little bit of land, "I guess I am… but, don't you think it's odd that no one else has returned yet?"  
我忍不住笑了。她的话让我稍微平静了一些。我想我们还不完全了解这个新世界的规则。我们不知道在我们这片小土地之外还有什么，“我想我是……但你不觉得奇怪吗，为什么还没有其他人回来？”

"Like who?" “比如谁？”

I think about all the people who could return, "Well… Misato, the technicians… the inhabitants of the town…"  
我想着所有可能回来的人，“嗯……美里，技术人员……镇上的居民……”

"Maybe they had but we can't find them yet. Maybe they came back further up the beach or even closer to Tokyo-3. It's not like we have the resources to search for them. Neither of us can drive, we don't have a radio and…"  
"也许他们曾经来过，但我们还没找到。也许他们回到了更靠近海滩上游的地方，甚至更接近东京-3。我们并没有资源去搜寻他们。我们俩都不会开车，也没有无线电，而且……"

She suddenly stands up and looks out towards the sea, she's curiously eyeing the head of Lilith. It's sunken into the sea somewhat, its hideous grinning face now becoming more obscured by the water. In the distance I can see the stone forms of the Eva series hanging there. Asuka is still scanning the horizon.  
她突然站起身，望向大海，好奇地盯着莉莉丝的头。它沉入了海中，那张丑陋的笑脸现在被水遮掩得更模糊了。远处，我能看到那些石化的 EVA 系列机体悬挂在那里。明日香仍在扫视着地平线。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"I never thought of that before…"  
"我以前从未想过这一点……"

"What didn't you think of?"  
"你没想到什么？"

"We should leave, and get back to the apartment. I think it's time we learned how to drive."  
"我们该走了，回公寓去。我想是时候我们学会开车了。"

"Huh what for?" "啊？为什么？"

She doesn't answer me and instead starts walking back towards the town. I follow behind her struggling at first to keep up with her.  
她没有回答我，而是开始走回镇上。我紧随其后，起初有些吃力地跟上她的步伐。

"Asuka, what… what is it?"  
“明日香，怎么……怎么了？”

**…Everyone would eventually know…  
……大家最终都会知道的……**

Shinji can't know this yet but we have a problem. I've only just realized something and because of it I'm glad that no one has returned to our area yet. We're basically fugitives, wanted by the Japanese Government with an explicit order to eliminate us. That's why the JSSDF invaded our home, that's why they committed a mass slaughter of NERV and that's why I had to fight against other living people. The Japanese Prime Minister believing we were going to instigate Third Impact sent them in to kill us all and they would have succeeded if I hadn't awoken at the right time and stopped them.  
真嗣现在还不能知道这些，但我们遇到了一个问题。我刚刚才意识到这一点，因此我很庆幸目前还没有人回到我们的区域。我们基本上成了逃犯，被日本政府通缉，明确下令要消灭我们。这就是为什么日本自卫队会入侵我们的家，这就是为什么他们屠杀了 NERV 的所有人，这就是为什么我不得不与其他活着的人战斗。日本首相相信我们会引发第三次冲击，于是派他们来杀掉我们所有人，如果不是我在关键时刻醒来并阻止了他们，他们早就得逞了。

It was false of course, SEELE had supplied the Prime Minister with false information while they moved in the background to start it themselves. So this is the issue, does the world know of SEELEs role in this or is that information limited to myself and Shinji? How much was shared with others during Instrumentality anyway? What are the rules here?  
当然，这是虚假的，SEELE 向首相提供了假情报，同时他们在幕后行动，准备自己启动冲击。所以问题来了，世界是否知道 SEELE 在这件事中的角色，还是这些信息仅限于我和真嗣？在人类补完计划中，到底有多少信息被分享给了其他人？这里的规则是什么？

Myself and Shinji were special, we spent a lot of time in each other's heads but how much of that is true for the rest of the world. God, it's so confusing. What I'm sure of though is that we should start being more careful going forward. We need to be prepared to move, they won't hesitate to kill us. I know how those soldiers held a gun to Shinjis head and I had an entire contingent of tanks, VTOLs and otherwise coming at me.  
我和真嗣是特别的，我们花了很多时间在彼此的脑海中，但这对世界上其他人来说又有多少真实性呢？天啊，这太令人困惑了。不过我确信的是，我们今后应该更加小心。我们需要准备好随时行动，他们不会犹豫杀掉我们。我知道那些士兵是如何用枪指着真嗣的头，而我则面对着一整队坦克、垂直起降机和其他装备。

The second thing I've realized is that there were NERV shelters and complexes built outside of Tokyo-3. If we can make it to one of them we should find equipment and maybe we can make contact with the outside world. We'll need to operate under false names though, Evangelion pilot's Asuka Langley Sohryu and Shinji Ikari suddenly appearing is bad news.  
我意识到的第二件事是，NERV 在东京-3 之外建造了避难所和综合体。如果我们能到达其中一个，我们应该能找到设备，也许还能与外界取得联系。不过我们需要使用假名，突然出现的 EVA 驾驶员惣流·明日香·兰格雷和碇真嗣可不是什么好消息。

First though we need to be able to get to one of them. I memorised the locations of them all the way back to Tokyo-2. Have I ever mentioned just how brilliant I am? To get to them though we need to be able to drive. So that is where my plan begins. I drop my pace somewhat letting Shinji catch up with me. I'm aware of the smile across my face. I think it worries him somewhat, or maybe the fact that I haven't explained it to him properly is what's concerning him but he looks nervous.  
首先，我们得能到达其中一个地点。我早就记住了从这里一直到东京-2 的所有位置。我有没有提过我有多聪明？不过要到达那些地方，我们得能开车。这就是我的计划开始的地方。我稍微放慢了脚步，让真嗣跟上我。我能感觉到自己脸上的笑容。我想这让他有点担心，或者可能是因为我还没向他解释清楚，总之他看起来很紧张。

"Asuka what… where are we going?"  
“明日香，我们……要去哪儿？”

"Shinji, do you remember any of the evacuation procedures at all?"  
“真嗣，你还记得任何疏散程序吗？”

He shakes his head, "No… I, well I remember when there was an Angel attack they'd move people into the Tokyo-3 shelters."  
他摇了摇头，“不……我，呃，我记得有一次天使袭击时，他们会把人们转移到东京-3 的避难所。”

I nod, "Exactly but what about the shelters outside of Tokyo-3?"  
我点头，“没错，但东京-3 以外的避难所呢？”

"I... didn't know there were any, I mean the Angels just attacked Tokyo-3 because of Lilith."  
“我……不知道还有其他的，我是说，天使只是因为莉莉丝而攻击东京-3。”

"The Japanese Government didn't know that though did they? I mean we didn't even know that until Third Impact started."  
日本政府并不知情，对吧？我是说，直到第三次冲击开始我们才得知这一消息。

He pauses, "Well I… knew before."  
他顿了顿，“其实我……之前就知道。”

"What?" "什么？"

I don't remember gaining this bit of information during Instrumentality. I actually stop and look at him. Something the Third Child knew about NERV that I didn't? Of course, his father ran the place. Special little Shinji gets advanced knowledge.  
我不记得在融合过程中获得过这些信息。我甚至停下来看着他。作为第三适格者，他知道一些我不知道的关于 NERV 的事情？当然，他父亲是那里的负责人。特殊的真嗣总是能提前知晓。

"I… saw it when I had to stop Kawor… it doesn't matter. I didn't know what it was and by that time the last Angel was gone so it made no difference."  
"我……是在不得不阻止卡沃……这无关紧要。我当时不知道那是什么，而且那时最后一个使徒已经消失了，所以它无关紧要。"

I don't have time to ask him about it now but I'll make sure to do so. Clearly something is missing from my knowledge of Shinji Ikari. I guess not everything is shared during Instrumentality, maybe only the parts we seek out. Like I said, we don't exactly know the rules.  
我现在没时间问他这件事，但我一定会确保问清楚。显然，我对碇真嗣的了解有所缺失。我猜在人类补完计划中，并非所有事情都会被分享，或许只有我们主动寻求的部分。就像我说的，我们并不完全了解规则。

"Anyway, like I was saying the Japanese Government didn't know that so they had other shelters built all the way to Tokyo-2. Including ones for themselves. All of them fully stocked with food, power, running water, equipment. We can get ourselves to one, and we might be able to contact the outside world."  
"总之，就像我刚才说的，日本政府当时并不知情，所以他们一直建到了东京-2 的其他避难所。包括他们自己的。所有这些都储备了充足的食物、电力、自来水、设备。我们可以设法前往其中一个，或许还能与外界取得联系。"

I decide to leave out the parts about false identities for the moment, deal with that when it comes to it. For now we need to get back to the apartment and learn how to drive one of the cars there.  
我决定暂时不提虚假身份的事，到时候再处理。现在我们需要回到公寓，学会如何驾驶那里的汽车。

"You think they'll be fine?"  
“你觉得他们会没事吗？”

"I don't see why not, I mean the town we're in is fine and managed to escape the destruction of Tokyo-3 so I reckon the shelter will be fine as well. It's a long way out though, so that's why we need to be able to drive."  
“我看不出为什么不会，我是说我们所在的城镇很好，成功避开了第三新东京市的毁灭，所以我想避难所也会没事的。不过那地方很远，所以我们需要学会开车。”

"How far?" “多远？”

I shrug my shoulders, "Fifteen, maybe twenty miles. Much too far to walk, I'm getting sick of this couple of mile walk we have to do every day to the beach as it is."  
我耸耸肩，“十五英里，也许二十英里。太远了，走过去根本不可能。我已经厌倦了每天为了去海滩不得不走的那几英里路。”

"But we're not old enough…"  
“但我们还没到年龄……”

Is he going to protest at every little violation of the law we may or may not commit in this wasteland?  
他是不是要在我们在这片废土上可能或不可能犯下的每一个小小的违法行为时都抗议一番？

"Then they can just add it to our ongoing list of violations along with breaking and entering, stealing and squatting in someone else's home. Are you stupid, we have to do what it takes to survive! Just be thankful I haven't thought about who we'll eat first if supplies run low."  
那他们可以把这些都加到我们那不断增长的违规清单上，包括破门而入、偷窃和霸占别人的家。你是不是傻，我们得做一切能做的事来生存！要庆幸我还没想过如果物资短缺，我们该先吃谁。

He immediately stops and looks horrified, "That was a joke Shinji."  
他立刻停下，露出惊恐的表情，"那是开玩笑的，真嗣。"

A nervous laugh from him, and he starts walking again and he is still protesting about the learning to drive thing, "None of us know how to drive though, I mean we haven't taken any lessons or anything…"  
他紧张地笑了笑，又开始走动，仍然抗议着学车的事情，“但我们都不会开车啊，我是说我们没上过任何课程或什么的……”

"How hard can it really be, I mean compared to a sixty foot robot anyway? We'll be fine, we'll find an automatic and just take it slow."  
“能有多难呢，我是说，比起六十英尺高的机器人来说？我们会没事的，找个自动挡的车，慢慢来就行了。”

"Is this really alright?"  
“这样真的好吗？”

I already know her response and instantly I can feel her staring holes into me. I'm stupid and it's about survival. She is of course right but I can't help feeling guilty. We've already taken so much and now we're taking a car as well. I'm not exactly sure why she had to pick this one either, couldn't we have had something a little bit smaller and less expensive to start off with?  
我已经知道她的回答，立刻就能感觉到她在用目光刺穿我。我真傻，这都是为了生存。她当然是对的，但我忍不住感到内疚。我们已经拿走了那么多，现在连车也要拿走。我也不太明白她为什么非得选这辆，难道我们不能先找辆小一点、便宜一点的吗？

At least she made sure to pick an automatic car. That should make things slightly easier. Still I'm really nervous about this, I've never driven before. I'm thankful that there are no other cars or people on the road. I put the key into its slot and press the button on the dashboard to turn on the car's engine.  
至少她确保选了一辆自动挡的车。这应该会让事情稍微容易些。尽管如此，我还是非常紧张，我从未开过车。幸好路上没有其他车辆或行人。我把钥匙插进槽里，按下仪表盘上的按钮启动汽车引擎。

"You know what to do now right?"  
“你知道现在该怎么做吧？”

I shake my head and hear her sigh, "Look its simple. Put your foot on the brake, and put the gear into Drive, that's the big one marked with the letter D for Dumkopf."  
我摇摇头，听到她叹了口气，“看，很简单。把脚放在刹车上，然后把档位挂到前进档，就是那个标着字母 D 的大档位。”

Ignoring her taunt I put my foot down on the brake and anxiously bring the gear position to the Drive position. I slowly lift my left foot and the car moves forward with something of a groan. I immediately put my foot back down on the brake.  
无视她的嘲讽，我把脚踩在刹车上，紧张地将档位推到前进档。我慢慢抬起左脚，车子带着些许呻吟声向前移动。我立刻又把脚踩回刹车上。

Panicking I turn towards her, "What did I do wrong?"  
我惊慌失措地转向她，“我做错了什么？”

"Drop the handbrake." "放下手刹。"

She's pointing at one of the other sticks in the middle of us, I press the button on it and drop it down. Now releasing my foot off of the brake the car slowly rolls forwards without any groaning or sounds of struggling. The road in front of us is thankfully clear, so I place both of my hands on the wheel and slowly get used to the car being in motion.  
她指向我们中间的另一根操纵杆，我按下上面的按钮，将其放下。现在我松开脚刹，汽车缓缓向前滚动，没有发出任何吱嘎声或挣扎的声音。幸运的是，前方的道路畅通无阻，于是我将双手放在方向盘上，慢慢适应着车辆行驶的感觉。

"I told you it was easy."  
"我告诉过你这很简单。"

I can't respond to her, I'm too busy concentrating on the driving. Making sure my left foot is covering the brake, making sure my right foot is lightly touching the accelerator. Flipping between watching my speed and looking out of the main window. I haven't even checked my mirrors yet. Isn't that supposed to be a thing? Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre that sort thing? How people do this with traffic and manual gears is beyond me, there is so much to take in.  
我无法回应她，我正全神贯注于驾驶。确保我的左脚覆盖在刹车上，右脚轻轻触碰油门。在关注车速和观察前方之间来回切换。我甚至还没检查过后视镜。那不是应该做的吗？镜子、信号、操作之类的？在有交通和手动挡的情况下，人们是如何做到这一切的，我实在难以理解，需要关注的事情太多了。

Next to me I'm aware of Asuka smiling happily with her window down and her arm leaning on it. She decided that she would wait until her bandages are off. It's been a couple of weeks now so I'm sure they can come off but she is reluctant to go through with it. She has let me change the one on her arm already but the one over her eye she won't even talk about.  
我旁边的明日香正开心地笑着，车窗摇下，手臂搭在窗沿上。她决定等到绷带拆掉后再说。已经过去几周了，我相信可以拆掉了，但她似乎不太愿意这么做。她已经让我帮她换了手臂上的绷带，但遮住眼睛的那块她连提都不愿意提。

That's the one I'm worried about. The other wounds to her have healed up enough. The scarring fading to be barely noticeable but her eye. What if that never recovered? What if she is blind in that eye now? She'd never forgive me for that.  
那正是我担心的。她身上的其他伤口已经愈合得差不多了。疤痕淡到几乎看不见，但她的眼睛。如果那只眼睛永远无法恢复怎么办？如果她现在那只眼睛失明了怎么办？她永远不会原谅我的。

"Eyes on the road Shinji!"  
"看路，真嗣！"

I quickly jerk my head up at the sound of her voice and notice I'm drifting to the side ever so slightly. I immediately correct myself.  
听到她的声音，我迅速抬起头，注意到自己正微微偏向一侧。我立刻纠正了自己的姿势。

"Sorry!" “对不起！”

"Yeah well, I've already died once and I don't plan on doing it again so just be more careful!"  
"是啊，我已经死过一次了，不打算再来一次，所以你得更小心点！"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

We drive around the empty streets for a time, allowing me to get used to the way the car handles and feels. It's way too big for someone starting out but after about half an hour or so I feel myself starting to get the hang of it. It isn't like I have much to do, there is no traffic to worry about. No pedestrians or traffic lights. All I need to focus on is speeding up when I need to, slowing down when I have to and keeping control on the turns. I doubt I'd pass a test like this but I should be able to get us to where we need to go.  
我们在空荡荡的街道上兜了一会儿风，让我适应这辆车的操控和感觉。对于初学者来说，它实在太大了，但大约半小时后，我开始逐渐掌握窍门。其实也没什么需要做的，不用担心交通，没有行人或红绿灯。我只需专注于必要时加速，需要时减速，并在转弯时保持控制。我怀疑自己能否通过这样的考试，但应该能把我们带到目的地。

We continue driving around a bit and I eventually take us out of the town. I'm watching my speed carefully keeping it at a maximum of thirty miles an hour. I can probably go faster but I want to get used to the car a bit more before pushing it. Eventually after an hour of driving and following Asuka's directions she turns to me.  
我们继续兜风，最终我驾车驶离了小镇。我小心翼翼地控制着速度，保持在最高三十英里每小时。也许可以开得更快，但我想在加速前更熟悉这辆车。大约一小时后，按照明日香的指示行驶，她转向我。

"I think we should probably head back to the apartment now Shinji."  
“我想我们现在应该回公寓了，真嗣。”

We exchange no words on the journey back but it isn't an awkward silence. Strange as it may sound considering our situation I actually enjoyed today. Doing what I've done and hearing her words this morning has given me some hope. Maybe there are others who have returned but we just haven't encountered them yet. Maybe my mother wasn't lying to me when she said those things, after all three billion is a lot of people. They won't all turn up at once or on that beach. I just hope the others might come back soon.  
回程路上我们没有交谈，但这并非尴尬的沉默。尽管听起来可能有些奇怪，考虑到我们的处境，我今天其实过得很愉快。做了我该做的事，听了她今早的话，让我心中燃起了希望。也许还有其他人回来了，只是我们尚未遇到。也许我母亲说那些话时并没有骗我，毕竟三十亿人是个庞大的数字。他们不会一下子全部出现，也不会都在那片海滩上。我只希望其他人能尽快回来。

**…Never loved before, placed herself in reach…  
…从未爱过，却将自己置于触手可及之处…**

I'm scared to go to sleep tonight. Shinji of course went to sleep instantly, I guess my words today have helped him. That was the role I picked after all. To protect him and make sure he is alright. I'm doing a good job as well if I don't say so myself.  
今晚我害怕入睡。真嗣当然立刻就睡着了，我想我今天的话对他有所帮助。毕竟，我选择的角色就是保护他，确保他安然无恙。如果我不自夸的话，我做得还不错。

That's what is going to make the next few days difficult. I've made a decision. If we're going to keep pushing forward together I need to finally have that discussion with him. I need us to lay out our feelings and fears for each other and be honest. I need neither of us to hold back and I'm scared of it. I need honesty from him but I don't want to hurt him or push him away. That's why tomorrow I'm going to be removing the bandage from my eye as well, I need to confront myself before I confront our issues.  
接下来的几天将会很艰难，原因就在于此。我已经做出了决定。如果我们打算继续携手前进，我必须和他进行那场迟来的对话。我们需要坦诚地表达彼此的感受和恐惧，毫无保留。我害怕这一刻的到来，但我需要他的真诚，同时也不想伤害他或让他远离。这就是为什么明天我也要揭开自己眼睛上的绷带，我需要在面对我们的问题之前先直视自己。

For tonight though. I'll wrap my arm around him and snuggle into his back. I'll use him to comfort myself and build him up until the time I finally tear him down. God I hate myself for this.  
不过，今晚我会伸出胳膊搂住他，紧贴他的后背。我会利用他来安慰自己，不断鼓励他，直到我最终不得不让他面对现实。天哪，我真恨这样的自己。

### Chapter 5 These moments made me then…  
Deep breaths Asuka, you can do this. You're more than capable, it's only a stupid bandage after all. What is there to be frightened of?  
深呼吸，明日香，你能做到的。你完全有能力，不过是一条愚蠢的绷带而已。有什么好害怕的呢？

Yet as I look in this mirror and see Shinji sitting on the bed behind me I have everything to be frightened of. These scars on my body, the scars that lie beneath these bandages signify something. They signify my defeat and my death. They are eternal brands of my violation by those monsters and will remind me forever of how I wasn't strong enough to beat them. The idea of him seeing them turns my stomach.  
然而，当我看着镜子，看到真嗣坐在我身后的床上时，我有太多需要害怕的东西。我身上的这些伤疤，藏在绷带下的伤疤，象征着什么。它们象征着我的失败和死亡。它们是那些怪物对我侵犯的永恒烙印，将永远提醒我，我不够强大，无法击败它们。他看到这些伤疤的想法让我感到恶心。

He thinks I'm so strong yet what are these scars but evidence to the contrary. A reminder to myself and the world of how much of a failure Asuka Langley Sohryu really is. It isn't enough that I carry around mental scars that will haunt me forever but now I have these physical ones marring my body too.  
他认为我如此坚强，然而这些伤疤不过是相反的证据。它们提醒我自己和世界，我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，是多么的失败。我不仅要背负将永远困扰我的心理创伤，现在还要加上这些玷污我身体的物理伤痕。

I had intended this to be quick. I'd take off the bandages on my arm and then the ones over my eye and we'd be done. I'd reveal myself for him to see so I could show him that Asuka Langley Sohryu fears nothing. That despite the damage done to her she can rise against it.  
我本打算速战速决。先拆掉手臂上的绷带，再解开眼上的，一切就结束了。我要在他面前揭开自己的伪装，向他证明碇真嗣无所畏惧。即便遭受重创，她也能奋起反抗。

Absolute bullshit. The only thing rising right now is my anger and the urge to punch the mirror. To watch that Asuka standing in front of me dissolved into tiny pieces of glass. I realize that I can't do this in front of him.  
纯粹是胡扯。此刻唯一高涨的只有我的怒火和砸碎镜子的冲动。想看到镜中的自己化为无数玻璃碎片。我意识到不能在他面前这么做。

"Shinji, please leave." “真嗣，请离开。”

He nods and wordlessly exits the room and I breathe a sigh of relief. I turn again towards the mirror. It's funny, I used to be told how beautiful I was by all the boys in our school. When I walked past they all turned their head and noticed me. Perfect red-hair, German-Japanese and an Evangelion pilot how could I not draw their attention. I used to hate their attention. Pathetic little boys with their notes and their date requests. I barely even looked at myself in the mirror back in those days because I always hated what I saw. A little girl that had grown up to be vile, that lashed out at anyone and sought attention.  
他点点头，无声地离开了房间，我松了一口气。我又转向镜子。真可笑，以前学校里的男生都说我有多美。我走过时，他们都会转头看我。完美的红发，德日混血，还是一位《新世纪福音战士》的驾驶员，我怎能不吸引他们的目光。我曾讨厌他们的关注。那些可悲的小男孩，递纸条，邀约约会。那些日子里，我几乎不照镜子，因为我讨厌自己看到的样子。一个长成了恶毒的小女孩，对谁都发脾气，渴望关注。

I don't see that girl anymore in the mirror. I see someone who has been broken now. Someone who is torn between trying to maintain that confidence and spark in the hope that it saves another and also in trying to let go of the baggage that surrounds her. I can see both the mental and physical scars in that person in the mirror, erasing any traces of beauty she might have had.  
我在镜子里再也看不到那个女孩了。我看到的是一个已经破碎的人。一个在试图保持那份自信和火花之间挣扎的人，希望它能拯救另一个人，同时也在试图放下围绕着她的包袱。我能在镜中人身上看到精神和肉体上的伤痕，抹去了她可能拥有的任何美丽痕迹。

I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu but who is she? Who is underneath these bandages? Who is underneath all of this? Is it really alright for me to be here?  
我甚至不知道自己是谁了。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，但她又是谁？绷带下的人是谁？这一切之下的人是谁？我真的可以在这里吗？

Slowly I reach to the bandage over my left arm and begin to unravel it. I go slowly not daring to look at my arm as bit by bit the bandage comes away and falls to the floor. I bring my arm into my view holding it up in front of me. Staring directly at my hand I clench and unclench it a number of times seeing it for the first time. Slowly my eyes work their way downwards. Along the side of my arm I can see the faint red line from where it was sliced clean in half by one of their spears.  
我缓缓伸手去解左臂上的绷带，开始小心翼翼地拆解。我不敢直视自己的手臂，一点一点地，绷带脱落并掉落在地上。我将手臂举到眼前，直视着我的手，反复握紧又松开，这是第一次真正看到它。我的目光缓缓下移，沿着手臂一侧，可以看到那条因被他们的长矛干净利落切开而留下的淡淡红线。

I look at myself in the mirror again and nod at the reflection with determination. I know what I have to do next. I have to see this through to the end. I have to see everything. I reach up to the patch on my eye.  
我再次对着镜子中的自己点头，眼神坚定。我知道接下来该做什么。我必须坚持到底。我必须看清一切。我伸手去触碰眼上的眼罩。

Everything will be alright, it's just a bandage. It's like my arm, all will be healed.  
一切都会好起来的，这只是个绷带。就像我的手臂一样，一切都会愈合。

I keep on telling myself that because I'm terrified. This eye has been in darkness for two weeks. I can feel it there when I blink, I can feel it move when I look around but I haven't seen anything out of it for that time. I'm terrified that when I remove this bandage I still won't see anything out of it.  
我不断地告诉自己这一点，因为我害怕极了。这只眼睛已经在黑暗中度过了两周。我眨眼时能感觉到它的存在，我环顾四周时能感觉到它的移动，但在这段时间里，我从未通过它看到任何东西。我害怕当我拆下这个绷带时，我仍然无法通过它看到任何东西。

Come on Asuka, let's get this over and done with shall we.  
来吧，明日香，让我们把这件事做完吧。

The tape keeping the patch attached to my face stings slightly as I start to remove it. I instinctively close my eyes as I feel it coming away from my face. After what feels like a lifetime the patch is finally off and it too falls to the floor joining the heap of bandages.  
当我开始撕下贴在脸上的胶带时，它微微刺痛。我本能地闭上眼睛，感觉到它从我的脸上脱落。仿佛过了一个世纪，补丁终于被取下，它也掉在地上，加入了绷带的堆里。

Now or never… 此时不搏，更待何时…

I open my good eye and see myself in the mirror. I can see some small amounts of scarring around the eye. Those too are very faint. Here we go.  
我睁开那只好眼睛，望向镜子中的自己。眼周有些细微的疤痕，同样非常淡。准备好了。

I begin to open my other eye and immediately feel a bit of pain as light hits it for the first time in two weeks. There is some blurriness at first but after a few moments it adjusts to the new sensations. I'm looking at myself in the mirror again, two working bright blue eyes are staring back at me and I can't help but smile.  
我开始尝试睁开另一只眼，光线初次照射进来，顿时感到一丝疼痛。起初视线有些模糊，但片刻后便适应了这些新感觉。我再次看向镜子，两颗明亮的蓝眼睛正回望着我，我不禁露出了微笑。

I need to know more though, I need to confront everything. I need to see the full Asuka Langley Sohryu before this is over. I slowly unbutton my jeans and slide them down onto the floor. Kicking them aside my hands go to my top and I slide that off. I'm stood now in just my bra and a pair of panties.  
我还需要了解更多，我必须直面一切。在这结束之前，我得看清完整的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我缓缓解开牛仔裤的扣子，将它们褪到地板上。踢开它们，我的手伸向上衣，轻轻脱下。现在，我只穿着胸罩和内裤站在那里。

My hands reach around to my back and I unclasp the bra and let that fall freely to the ground before finally removing the panties. I'm looking at the entirety of myself in the mirror now. My red hair falls freely down to my shoulders, a few strands just meeting the top of my breasts. I can now see every scar on my body. I can see the scar running up my arm. I can see the tiny pin pricks on my stomach. I can see the faint line running from the middle of my breasts down to just above where my trimmed pubic hair is.  
我的手绕到背后，解开胸罩的扣子，任其自由落在地上，最后脱掉了内裤。现在，我正对着镜子审视自己的全部。我的红发自由地垂落到肩头，几缕发丝刚好触及胸部上方。我可以看到身上的每一道伤疤。我看到手臂上的疤痕，肚子上的小针孔，还有从胸部中间延伸到修剪过的阴毛上方的那道淡淡痕迹。

All of the scars are faded, some are more noticeable than others. I take another deep breath and step closer to the mirror and I place my previously bandaged hand out almost as if to touch the girl on the other side.  
所有的伤疤都已褪色，有些比其他的更显眼。我深吸一口气，更靠近镜子，伸出之前包扎过的手，仿佛要去触碰镜中的女孩。

I ask myself the question again, who is Asuka Langley Sohryu? What is she? Is she the vile girl I think myself to be? Is she the strong girl Shinji loves? Is she an elite pilot or a terminal loser? Was she the catalyst for the end of the world? Is she a survivor? Is she in love? What and who is she?  
我再次问自己，惣流·明日香·兰格雷是谁？她是什么？是我自认为的那个卑鄙女孩吗？是真嗣所爱的坚强女孩吗？她是精英驾驶员还是彻底的失败者？她是世界末日的催化剂吗？她是幸存者吗？她恋爱了吗？她是什么，又是谁？

Am I none of those things or all of the above?  
我是否这些都不是，或者全都是？

It's funny but the last time I did something like this was in a small shack on the outskirts of Tokyo-3. I stripped off, folded my clothes neatly and waited for death to take me. I was running away then. I'm not running now, instead I'm trying to find answers.  
说来好笑，上次我做类似的事情是在第三新东京市郊外的一个小棚屋里。我脱掉衣服，整齐地叠好，等待死亡的降临。那时我在逃避。现在我不是在逃避，而是在试图寻找答案。

I step away from the mirror and look my naked body up and down again. I look at all the scars before looking at the person in there deep in the eyes. What am I to me? What am I to him?  
我离开镜子，再次上下打量自己赤裸的身体。我审视着所有的伤疤，然后深深地凝视着镜中人的眼睛。我对我自己意味着什么？我对他是怎样的存在？

My voice is an unconvincing whisper. Before I even finish speaking I already know I need more, "I am Asuka Langley Sohryu, no more and no less."  
我的声音微弱而缺乏说服力。话音未落，我已经意识到我需要更多，“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，不多也不少。”

**…and by them now I am defined again…  
…而现在，我又被他们重新定义了…**

I'm not sure how long Asuka has been in there for but I'm starting to get worried. I understand why she didn't want me in there. All of those scars on her body, all of them are my fault and she hates me. She can't stomach the idea of me being there while she takes those bandages off.  
我不确定明日香在里面待了多久，但我开始感到担忧。我理解她为什么不想让我进去。她身上的每一道伤疤，都是我的错，她恨我。她无法忍受我在场，看着她拆下那些绷带。

I've been trying to figure her out since we returned but I don't understand her. I can never hope to understand her because I'm too much of a coward to just ask her outright what she is feeling. I'm too scared to reach out to her even though I know how much she is hurting. I know that her smiles and her confidence since we have returned are all a front. I know the anger that lays behind those eyes, I've seen her at night time glaring at me when she thought I was asleep. I've seen her hand twitch when I do something to irritate her.  
自从我们回来后，我一直在试图了解她，但我并不理解她。我永远无法理解她，因为我太懦弱，不敢直接问她到底在想什么。我太害怕去接近她，尽管我知道她有多痛苦。我知道自从我们回来后，她的笑容和自信都是伪装。我知道她眼神背后的愤怒，我见过她在夜晚以为我睡着时对我怒目而视。我见过我惹恼她时她手的抽搐。

I know the sadness within her. That in her heart she is mourning the death of her mother and having to confront that. I know her sadness at losing who she thought she was when she tasted defeat in battle after battle.  
我知道她内心的悲伤。在她心中，她在哀悼母亲的去世，并不得不面对这一点。我知道她在一次次战斗失败后，失去了自我认知的悲伤。

Yet I can't do anything because I'm a coward. All I can do is watch on as she continues to put on this façade. I'm so scared of being hurt myself that I can't even reach out and hold her. Then again do I deserve to? After what I did to her.  
然而我什么也做不了，因为我是个懦夫。我只能眼睁睁看着她继续维持这副假面。我太害怕自己受伤，以至于连伸出手去拥抱她都做不到。再说了，我配吗？毕竟我曾那样伤害过她。

She doesn't know this but I was nearly sick again this morning. It was shortly after I woke up. I saw going from the shower to our room. The towel had slipped slightly giving me a view of her breasts, allowing me to see all of it. I felt myself go stiff immediately in reaction to it and straight away it brought back the memory of what I did that day and I nearly felt my breakfast come back up. I haven't told her about it, she wanted to know if I was ill again but I can't tell her about that. It's what I deserve after all.  
她不知道的是，今早我又差点吐了。那是在我刚醒来不久，我看到她从浴室走向我们的房间。毛巾滑落了一些，让我瞥见了她的胸部，这一切尽收眼底。我立刻感到身体僵硬，随即那天的记忆涌上心头，差点让我把早餐都吐出来。我没告诉她这件事，她想知道我是不是又病了，但我无法向她坦白。毕竟，这是我应得的惩罚。

Today I spent more time practicing how to drive. We drove to the beach and back and looked out for anyone else returning. Asuka suggested we come back tomorrow before we drive to the shelter and we leave something there just in case anyone does some back. A sign or a message informing them to travel to this town. That there are resources here for them and other survivors. We broke into a newsagents and grabbed a few supplies. Managed to cover it just enough to be seen but also protect it should it rain and tomorrow we'll take it to the beach and leave it there for people.  
今天我花了更多时间练习开车。我们开车去了海滩再返回，留意是否有其他人也在返回。明日我们打算在前往避难所之前再去一次海滩，留下些东西以防万一有人返回。比如一个标志或一条信息，告诉他们可以来这个小镇，这里有资源和其他幸存者。我们闯进了一家报刊亭，拿了一些物资。设法将其遮盖得既显眼又能防雨，明天我们就把它带到海滩上，留在那里供人发现。

There is another place I want to visit before we go to the shelter too. It's not far from the beach but I left somewhere there I need to take back before we move on. If I truly believe they will come back then I need to get it.  
在我们去避难所之前，还有另一个地方我想去看看。离海滩不远，但我在那里留下了一些需要取回的东西，在我们继续前行之前。如果我真的相信他们会回来，那我就必须把它拿回来。

I hear a rustling at the door to the bedroom. The door opens slowly and Asuka finally walks through. She is wearing a dressing-gown. I can see that the bandage on her arm has completely gone as has the one over her eye. She stands in the doorway and her eyes meet mine. I can see the light scarring around her eye. I feel the hairs on the back of my neck prick up as she fixes me with a cold stare.  
我听到卧室门外传来一阵窸窣声。门缓缓打开，终于，明日香走了进来。她穿着一件睡袍。我看到她手臂上的绷带已经完全不见了，眼睛上的绷带也是。她站在门口，目光与我相遇。我能看到她眼睛周围的光痕。当她用冰冷的目光盯着我时，我感到后颈的毛发竖了起来。

She hates me, she has seen the scarring and she blames me for all of it. Wordlessly she closes the door and walks towards me. She stops right in front of me and I feel myself growing smaller and wishing this sofa would swallow me up. She still hasn't said a word.  
她恨我，她看到了那些疤痕，她把这一切都归咎于我。她无声地关上门，朝我走来。她停在我面前，我感到自己仿佛在缩小，希望这张沙发能把我吞没。她仍然一言不发。

"A-A-Asuka…" “明……明日香……”

"I need you to do something Shinji…"  
"真嗣，我需要你做件事……"

"Is everything alright?" "一切都还好吗？"

It's a stupid question and I know it but she doesn't call me out on it. Instead she slowly unties the cord of the gown and continues to speak.  
这是个愚蠢的问题，我知道，但她并没有指出来。相反，她缓缓解开睡袍的系带，继续说着。

"I need you to do something Shinji…"  
"真嗣，我需要你做件事……"

She repeats herself, her hand still on the cord. She opens the robe and lets it fall to the ground. I immediately turn away realizing she is completely naked under the robe.  
她重复了一遍，手依旧握着绳子。她打开浴袍，任其滑落在地。我立刻转过身去，意识到她浴袍下什么都没穿。

"A-A-Asuka!" "A-A-A-明日香！"

"Look at me Shinji." "看着我，真嗣。"

Her words are cold, almost mechanical.  
她的话语冰冷，几乎不带感情。

"If you care about me at all, please look at me right now."  
"如果你真的在乎我，现在就请看着我。"

I slowly turn my head and I can see Asuka's nude form in front of me. I can see her red hair flowing down her body. I can see her breasts, her stomach, her legs, I can see every part of her. I can see parts I've only ever fantasized about. This isn't a fantasy though, this is real. I can also see each and every scar on her body.  
我缓缓转过头，眼前是明日香赤裸的身影。我能看到她那头红发顺着身体流淌而下。她的胸部、腹部、双腿，她的每一寸肌肤都尽收眼底。那些我只在幻想中见过的部位，此刻却真实地展现在我面前。这不是幻想，这是现实。我还能清晰地看到她身上每一道疤痕。

"A-A-Asuka…" “明…明日香…”

I can still barely get a word out, I'm too shocked. I'm too nervous to say anything but her name.  
我依旧难以吐出完整的句子，震惊与紧张让我只能呼唤她的名字。

"I need you to look at me, I need you to look at every scar on my body. I need you to look at every inch of me and I need you to tell me… am I still Asuka Langley Sohryu?"  
"我需要你看着我，我需要你看着我身上的每一道伤疤。我需要你审视我的每一寸肌肤，然后告诉我……我还是不是惣流·明日香·兰格雷？"

I don't understand the question, of course she is. Who else could she be? I nod my head.  
我不明白这个问题，她当然是。她还能是谁？我点了点头。

"Say it then!" "那就说出来！"

I nod my head and then hurry the words out, "You're still Asuka Langley Sohryu…"  
我点点头，然后急忙说出话来，“你仍然是惣流·明日香·兰格雷……”

"Liar." "骗子。"

"I-I'm not lying!" “我——我没有撒谎！”

"You're just repeating what I said because you think that is what I want to hear. What do you see when you look at me Shinji? Am I still her or not? Please."  
“你只是在重复我说的话，因为你认为那是我想听的。当你看着我时，真嗣，你看到了什么？我还是她吗，还是不是？请告诉我。”

I close my legs together trying to hide my reaction at seeing her nude form. I don't understand what this is about. What does she mean by still being her? Of course she is still her.  
我并拢双腿，试图掩饰看到她裸体时的反应。我不明白这是怎么回事。她说的‘依然是她’是什么意思？她当然还是她。

"I… see you Asuka, you're still her."  
“我…看到了，明日香，你依然是她。”

She looks down and I realize she's clenching her right hand in the same way I do something. Through gritted teeth she gives her response, "Then why are you still here?"  
她低头看去，我意识到她正像我一样紧握着右手。她咬紧牙关回应道：“那你为何还留在这里？”

"I… don't understand Asuka?"  
"我…不明白明日香？"

"Why are you here you idiot! After everything I did to you, after all I put you through over the last few months. After I caused you to end the world, why are you still here! If you still see that same person then why the fuck haven't you ran a mile from me!"  
"你为什么还在这里，你这个白痴！在我对你做了那么多之后，在过去的几个月里我让你经历了那么多。在我导致你终结了世界之后，为什么你还在这里！如果你仍然看到那个同样的人，那你他妈的为什么还没从我身边跑开！"

"Asuka I…" "明日香，我…"

"Look at me Shinji, look at what I am! Look at the state of my body, disfigured and covered in scars because of my foolish pride and arrogance. Listen to me, yelling and berating you because I don't know any better. Look at what I'm doing, disgracing myself in front of you because I can't figure out who the hell I am anymore. Why are you still here Shinji?"  
"看着我，真嗣，看看我现在是什么样子！看看我的身体，被愚蠢的骄傲和自大毁得面目全非，满是伤痕。听着我，对你大喊大叫，因为我不知道更好的方式。看看我在做什么，在你面前自取其辱，因为我已经不知道自己到底是谁了。为什么你还在这里，真嗣？"

I look up and I see she is actually crying. Asuka is crying in front of me and I realize the truth of what is happening. I realize the walls around her are crumbling down. She has been trying to stay strong these past two weeks for me and ignoring anything nagging at her. She deconstructed herself and put herself back together. She erected her wall in front of her again to protect me and now it's come down. I haven't noticed any of this, my wall had crumbled down from the moment I returned. I've been such an idiot.  
我抬头一看，发现她真的在哭。明日香在我面前哭泣，我意识到了正在发生的事情的真相。我意识到她周围的墙正在崩塌。这两周来，她一直努力在我面前保持坚强，忽视任何困扰她的事情。她拆解了自己，又重新组装起来。她再次竖起那堵墙来保护我，而现在它倒下了。我竟然一直没有注意到这一切，从我回来的那一刻起，我的墙就已经崩塌了。我真是个傻瓜。

Instrumentality was only a beginning, it was a wide open space where our issues, our fears and our thoughts were laid out in front of us in a wide open space. We could navigate and explore as we wished. Time stopped while we were there and when we thought we had an answer we could move onto the next. We could realize the answers to our problems and content with that move onto the other problem until we returned.  
神性化只是一个开始，它是一个广阔无垠的空间，我们的问题、恐惧和思绪都被摊开在这个广阔的空间里。我们可以随心所欲地导航和探索。在那里，时间停止了，当我们以为找到了答案，就可以继续下一个问题。我们可以意识到问题的答案，并满足于此，继续解决其他问题，直到我们回归。

Returning undid that though, we had the answers but instead of being given a wide open space to confront them everything was compressed into one small box again. It was packaged tight and placed back within our hearts, minds and souls and it hurts. Oh god it hurts so much.  
然而，回归却打破了这一切，我们虽然有了答案，但不再有广阔的空间去面对它们，一切又被压缩成一个小小的盒子。它被紧紧地包装好，重新放回我们的内心、思想和灵魂中，这很痛苦。哦，天哪，这太痛苦了。

Without thinking I jump up off of the sofa and I pick up the gown from the floor. She looks down at me and notices my current state but I don't care anymore. I pick up the gown and place it over her shoulders and direct her towards the sofa where she sits quietly. I still haven't said anything but I'm thinking over her question in my head, why am I still here?  
我毫不犹豫地从沙发上跳起来，捡起地上的长袍。她低头看着我，注意到我现在的状态，但我已经不在乎了。我拿起长袍，披在她的肩上，引导她走向沙发，她静静地坐下。我仍然没有说话，但在心里思考着她的问题，为什么我还在这里？

I've contemplated running away but it wasn't because of her. It was because of me. I don't deserve to be here or at least that's what I thought. Except I chose to be here and I made a promise that I'd try and make things right. It still hurts so much, I don't deserve to be close to her in any regard. She should be the one running a mile from me. Yet here we are. So why am I still here?  
我曾考虑过逃离，但这并非因为她，而是因为我自己。我不配待在这里，至少我是这么认为的。然而，我选择了留在这里，并许下承诺要尽力弥补。尽管如此，心痛依旧，我不配与她亲近。她本应离我远远的。可我们却依然在一起。那么，我为何还留在这里呢？

I love her is the simple answer and I don't want her to leave my side. She's helped me so much since returning. She made me feel better when I was ill, she made me smile in this hell and she kept me warm at night. After all I did to her she tried to look after me. I guess it'd be more appropriate to ask her why she is still here.  
简单来说，因为我爱她，我不想她离开我。自从回来后，她给予了我很多帮助。在我生病时她让我感觉好些，在这个地狱中她让我微笑，夜晚她让我感到温暖。尽管我曾那样对她，她仍试图照顾我。或许更应该问她为何还留在这里。

"I… Asuka… I… love you?"  
“我… 明日香… 我… 爱你？”

"Huh?" “啊？”

She turns to look at me, her eyes are red and her cheeks stained from crying. I repeat myself.  
她转过身来看着我，眼睛红肿，脸颊上还留着泪痕。我再次重复道。

"I'm here… because I love you Asuka. I won't run away from you."  
“我在这里…因为我爱你，明日香。我不会逃避你。”

She fixes her stare on me and her mouth opens slightly as if to reply. I half expect her to revert to the Asuka of old. To slap me and call me an idiot and run away. I expect her to ask me how I can be so stupid. Instead of replying she pulls her feet onto the sofa and buries her head into my shoulder. Nervously I place an arm around her as she sobs quietly.  
她凝视着我，嘴唇微微张开，似乎想要回答。我半期待着她变回过去的明日香。扇我一巴掌，骂我白痴，然后跑开。我期待她问我怎么能这么愚蠢。然而，她没有回答，而是把脚缩到沙发上，将头埋进我的肩膀。我紧张地用一只手臂环抱住她，她轻轻地啜泣着。

**…you always knew… ……你总是知道……**

I'm transfixed by the sight of my own grave. It's nothing special, maybe more than I deserve, just a piece of wood sticking out of the ground. Of course it isn't my literal grave. It is a marker put there by someone who thought I died. I suppose it makes sense that he'd have put this here when he returned, after all I did die.  
我被自己坟墓的景象深深吸引。它没什么特别的，也许比我应得的还要好些，只是一块木头竖在地上。当然，这不是我真正的坟墓。这是一个由某人放置的标记，他认为我已经死了。我想在他回来时放这个在这里是有道理的，毕竟我确实死了。

Still I'm a little bit angry. Did he not have faith that I'd come back? My anger is of course unjustified. Of course he had no faith when he come back. He was too busy just trying to survive. He was too busy throwing up at the thought of all the hell that had just occurred. He was too busy being terrified of the giant fucking head sinking into the ocean. Yet amidst all that he still kept us all in his memory. There are two markers at the front. These were for the two people he loved the most. Misato and myself. I went cold when he explained that.  
尽管如此，我还是有点生气。难道他就不相信我会回来吗？我的愤怒当然是不合理的。他回来时当然没有信心。他忙于只是试图生存。他忙于一想到刚刚发生的那些地狱般的情景就呕吐。他忙于对那颗巨大的头颅沉入海洋感到恐惧。然而，在这一切之中，他仍然将我们所有人铭记在心。前面有两块标记。这是为他最爱的两个人准备的。美里和我。当他解释这一点时，我感到一阵寒意。

Behind that are ones for our friends. Hikari, Touji and Kensuke. He even took the time to have ones for the three Bridge Bunnies. One the back row are ones for Dr Akagi, Professor Fuyutsuki and of course his father. I can't think of those three individuals in a good way anymore, I would never have taken the time to dedicate anything to them. All of them knew the truth about Eva, about us, about SEELE and they all let it go. They all conspired to let it happen. Watched as myself and Shinji got torn apart physically and emotionally until we had nothing left. We're the ones left to bear the burden of Third Impact whilst they enjoy their illusions. We're the ones feeling the guilt and seeing blood on our hands.  
后面是为我们的朋友们准备的。光、阿斗和真希波。他甚至抽时间为三位桥梁兔女郎准备了礼物。后排是为赤木博士、冬月教授，当然还有他的父亲准备的。我再也无法以善意看待这三个人了，我绝不会花时间为他们做任何事。他们都知道关于 EVA、关于我们、关于 SEELE 的真相，却都选择了沉默。他们合谋让这一切发生，眼睁睁看着我和真嗣在肉体和精神上被撕裂，直到我们一无所有。我们才是承受第三次冲击重担的人，而他们却沉溺于自己的幻象中。我们背负着罪恶感，手上沾满鲜血。

It isn't fair. I'm suffering because of them. I'm constantly blaming myself for what happened. I'm torturing myself over it. Shinji is blaming himself. Shinji is the one who spent the first forty-eight hours of his life back in this world throwing up from the mental torture. Yet I feel sorry for the three of them because they'll never experience true happiness again. Me and Shinji have a chance, they squandered theirs.  
这不公平。我因他们而受苦。我不断地自责，为此折磨自己。真嗣也在自责。真嗣是那个在这世界重生的前四十八小时里，因精神折磨而不断呕吐的人。然而，我为那三个人感到难过，因为他们再也无法体验真正的幸福。我和真嗣还有机会，他们却挥霍了自己的。

There is always the chance they'll return and what then? Do we forgive them? Confront them? Or will they suffer like we are? I guess it doesn't matter right now.  
他们总有可能回来，那时怎么办？我们是否原谅他们？面对他们？还是让他们承受我们正在经历的痛苦？我想现在这都不重要了。

I step away from the marker for my grave and with one swift motion kick it to the ground. I see Shinji turn to me, he is kneeling in front of the marker for Misato.  
我离开我的墓碑，一脚将其踢倒在地。我看到真嗣转向我，他正跪在美里小姐的墓碑前。

"Are you okay?" “你还好吗？”

"I am now." "我现在是。"

I've barely spoken to Shinji since last night. After he wrapped me in that gown and I lay sobbing in his lap I eventually fell asleep. I woke up in the bed with Shinji actually holding onto me for a change. I could barely look him in the eye or say anything to him over breakfast. It's been that way in the last hour or so. I want to say I'm not ashamed of what I did, but I am a little bit embarrassed. I didn't expect things to play out the way they did but since when has one of my plans ever gone the way I wanted it to?  
昨晚之后，我几乎没和真嗣说过话。在他用那件长袍裹住我，我趴在他腿上哭泣，最终睡着了。醒来时，我躺在床上，真嗣这次真的抱住了我。早餐时，我几乎不敢直视他的眼睛，也没法对他说什么。过去的一小时里，情况一直如此。我想说我并不为所做的事感到羞耻，但确实有点尴尬。我没想到事情会这样发展，但我的计划何时如愿过呢？

So why did I do what I did? I looked in that mirror and I saw a horrible person I guess. Someone who still hated herself for all she had put herself and others through. I felt sick when I thought of what I had done to Shinji and others, even though since I came back I've tried to protect him and to better myself it hasn't been enough. I guess I had to go to an extreme, show him exactly where I was physically and mentally, bare everything for him and see what he really thinks.  
那么，我为什么要这么做呢？我看着镜子，看到了一个可怕的人，我想。一个仍然憎恨自己，为自己和他人所经历的一切而自责的人。想到我对真嗣和其他人所做的事，我感到恶心，尽管回来后我努力保护他，努力变得更好，但这还不够。我想我必须采取极端手段，向他展示我身心所处的位置，赤裸裸地向他展示一切，看看他真正的想法。

So I let myself break down in front of him. For the first time ever I actually broke down crying in front of someone. No hiding, no forcing the tears back, I actually let it happen. Like I said, when I planned it all the night before that wasn't supposed to happen.  
于是我在他面前放任自己崩溃。这是我第一次真正在别人面前痛哭失声。没有掩饰，没有强忍泪水，我真的让它发生了。就像我昨晚计划的那样，这本不该发生的。

It was supposed to be a discussion. In my mind the night before I had it planned. I'd confront him over what he did. I'd yell at him and belittle him about it. Tell him how I want to see him do it again. Just as I did during Third Impact. Yet when I saw myself without those bandages I realized I didn't want to yell or belittle him. If I did that we'd just end up where we began so instead. So instead I wanted to show him the real me, the scared me, the upset and hurt me. The one who hates herself and regrets all the hurt and pain she has shown him.  
原本应该是一场讨论。前一晚我已经在心里计划好了。我要质问他所做的事。我会对他大吼大叫，贬低他。告诉他我想再看他做一次，就像第三次冲击时那样。然而当我看到自己没有那些绷带时，我意识到我不想大吼大叫或贬低他。如果那样做，我们只会回到原点。所以，我想要向他展示真实的我，那个害怕的我，那个难过和受伤的我。那个讨厌自己，后悔给他带来所有伤害和痛苦的我。

I don't regret any of it. So why am I unable to speak to him now or look him in the eye?  
我并不后悔这一切。那为什么我现在无法和他说话，甚至不敢直视他的眼睛呢？

It's because he told me he loves me. After all I put him through the fool loves me. I have no right to be loved by Shinji Ikari yet I'm so thankful for it because I love him back. I bet he thinks the same thing. Well here is the thing, people deserve to be loved. Even the poor bastards on the back row or this gravesite.  
只因他告诉我他爱我。毕竟我让他经历了那么多，这个傻瓜还是爱我。我没有资格被碇真嗣爱着，但我对此感激不尽，因为我同样爱他。我猜他也这么想。问题是，人们值得被爱。即使是后排的可怜虫或这片墓地上的逝者。

I watch curiously as Shinji takes something off of Misato's grave marker. I realize that it's her necklace. He takes it and puts it around his neck. He speaks, there is a trembling in his voice but also a firmness.  
我好奇地看着真嗣从美里墓碑上取下某样东西。我意识到那是她的项链。他拿起它，戴在了自己的脖子上。他开口说话，声音颤抖却坚定。

"Misato gave me this… when we were down in NERV before Third Impact. She gave me the necklace and shoved me into the elevator to Unit 01 and then she died. She had been shot moments before. It was my fault of course, I made no effort to do anything. She had to drag me."  
美里给了我这个……在第三次冲击前，我们在 NERV 地下的时候。她把项链给了我，把我推进了初号机的电梯，然后她就死了。她中枪了，就在那之前。当然，这是我的错，我什么都没做。她不得不拖着我。

I listen to him offering no words of comfort, this would have been around the time I was fighting the JSSDF on the surface. I remember her voice over the radio, telling me how Shinji would be joining me in Unit 01 shortly.  
我听着他，没有给予任何安慰的话语，这大概是我与 JSSDF 在地面上战斗的时候。我记得她在无线电里的声音，告诉我真嗣很快就会加入 01 号机。

"She kept on telling me I had to find my own reason to live. That the choices I made were worthwhile and I had to accept them. All I could do was tell her about how I always hurt people, that I can't pilot because I can't do anything, that all I was nothing more than a coward, that I was dishonest. I nearly told her about what I did to you."  
她一直告诉我，我必须找到自己活下去的理由。我做出的选择是有价值的，我必须接受它们。我只能告诉她，我总是伤害别人，我不能驾驶因为我什么都做不了，我不过是个懦夫，我不诚实。我差点告诉她我对你做了什么。

For the first time since last night I look in his eyes, "Why didn't you?"  
自昨晚以来，我第一次直视他的眼睛，“你为什么不呢？”

"I guess because I didn't want to disappoint her more than she already was. Maybe because I thought if she knew what I did she'd kill me herself and deep down I didn't really want to die."  
"我想是因为我不想让她比现在更失望。也许是因为我觉得如果她知道我做了什么，她会亲自杀了我，而内心深处我并不真的想死。"

"And yet when you got to your Eva you did nothing."  
"然而当你到达你的 Eva 时，你什么也没做。"

"I know… and I have nothing to say about that. I have nothing to say about what I did to you either Asuka. I keep on wanting to apologize but that isn't enough is it? I let you down."  
"我知道……对此我无话可说。对于我对你的所作所为，我也没有什么可说的，明日香。我一直想道歉，但这还不够，对吧？我让你失望了。"

I nod my head. The image of my dream from the other night flashes through my mind. The memory of what I did in the locker room accompanies it. "Yeah… you did."  
我点点头。前几晚梦境的画面在脑海中闪现。更衣室里我所做的一切也随之浮现。“是的……你确实做了。”

"I'm sorry Asuka." “对不起，明日香。”

I walk over to him and place a hand on his shoulder to comfort him as he cries. I guess I did get my discussion about it after all. A small victory for Asuka, it tastes shallow. I don't want an apology from him, not since the dream and the memories of what I've done came back to me. Yet I know he needs to do this, it might only be a temporary thing to make him feel better but I swore to protect him so I say the words he wants to hear.  
我走到他身边，把手放在他的肩膀上安慰他，因为他哭了。看来我终究还是谈到了这件事。对明日香来说，这是一场小小的胜利，滋味却浅薄。自从那个梦和那些我做过的事情的记忆回来后，我并不想要他的道歉。但我知道他需要这样做，尽管这可能只是暂时的，为了让他感觉好些，但我发誓要保护他，所以我得说出他想听的话。

"I forgive you Shinji."  
"我原谅你，真嗣。"

### Chapter 6 What are dreams?
Shinji asked that question during Instrumentality. I don't remember the exact conversation but I remember being there for it. Shinji was living in a dream at that point, attempting to find a realm in which he could find happiness. Somewhere away from reality where he was alone and happy. Yet it was told to him that this was just a fabrication. There was no true happiness to be found there. What he was experiencing was not a dream it was pure fantasy, a way to escape his reality.  
真嗣在人类补完计划期间提出了那个问题。我记不清具体的对话内容，但我记得当时在场。那时的真嗣生活在一场梦中，试图找到一个能让他感到幸福的地方。一个远离现实、独自快乐的地方。然而，有人告诉他，这只是一个虚构。在那里找不到真正的幸福。他所经历的并非梦境，而是纯粹的幻想，一种逃避现实的方式。

It becomes cyclical from that point, a dream is a continuation of our reality and our reality lies at the end of our dreams. Yet it doesn't explain what a dream is does it? A dream is a continuation of our reality and that is true in some cases. In terms of the dreams I have had recently of my mother or of Shinji in the hospital bed those were warped continuations of reality. My true reality was there when I woke up.  
从那时起，这一切变得循环往复，梦境是现实的延续，而现实则存在于梦境的尽头。但这并没有解释什么是梦境，对吧？梦境是现实的延续，这在某些情况下是正确的。就我最近梦见母亲或真嗣躺在医院床上的梦而言，那些是现实扭曲的延续。我真正的现实是在我醒来时存在的。

Yet last night I dreamt I was eating the most delicious chocolate cheesecake. Is that a continuation of my reality? If it is it's certainly disappointing that my reality doesn't have chocolate cheesecake within it.  
然而昨晚我梦见自己在吃最美味的巧克力芝士蛋糕。这是否是我现实的延续呢？如果是的话，那真是令人失望，因为我的现实中并没有巧克力芝士蛋糕。

So what the hell are dreams? Are they an expression of our desires? Warped distortions of reality? Messages or something else? My head hurts from even thinking about it. All I know right now is that I'm hungry and I want chocolate cheesecake.  
那么，梦到底是什么鬼东西？是我们欲望的体现吗？还是现实扭曲的映射？亦或是某种信息或其他什么？光是想想就让我头疼。我现在只知道我饿了，想吃巧克力芝士蛋糕。

"Asuka, we're here." “明日香，我们到了。”

I feel the car stop and nod at Shinji, clearing my cyclical internal discussion from my mind. I have to discuss things with myself on these car journeys because Shinji isn't used to driving and talking at the same time yet. So our journey happened in relative silence, no radio stations to tune into in the car and we don't have any CDs to throw on either. Maybe we should break into the supermarket I saw on the way here. Grab a few CDs and DVDs. It's only us now, may as well be entertained.  
我感觉到车停了下来，对真嗣点了点头，清空了脑海中循环的自我讨论。我必须在车上和自己讨论事情，因为真嗣还不习惯一边开车一边说话。所以我们的旅程相对沉默，车上没有电台可调，也没有 CD 可放。也许我们应该闯进来的路上看到的那家超市，拿几张 CD 和 DVD。现在只有我们了，不妨找点乐子。

On the outside the shelter doesn't look like much, just a building with a sign out front. It's the usual military stuff, trespassers will be shot and turn away now. Shinji parks the car up and we both walk towards the entrance. Inside is a simple desk with an elevator behind it.  
从外面看，这个避难所并不起眼，只是一栋前面挂着招牌的建筑。上面照例写着军事警告，闲人免进，违者将被击毙。真嗣把车停好，我们一起走向入口。里面是一张简单的桌子，后面有一部电梯。

"That's odd…" “真奇怪……”

I turn towards Shinji, "What is?"  
我转向真嗣，“什么奇怪？”

"The lights are on in here… do you think anyone is here?"  
“这里的灯亮着……你觉得会有人吗？”

I shake my head, "I doubt it. Probably have their own generators that are powered by… well something."  
我摇摇头，“我觉得不太可能。他们可能有自己供电的发电机，靠……嗯，某种东西。”

I walk towards the elevator entrance. It's clear immediately that this isn't a normal civilian shelter. This was made for the elite, for leaders and generals and people with money. Aside from the dust that has gathered the lobby area is pristine, almost like a hotel. I quickly look behind the desk and there is a sign-in book prepared for evacuees. There is a small cupboard with a number of visitor packs in there. I nab two for me and Shinji.  
我走向电梯入口。立刻就能看出这不是一个普通的民用避难所。这是为精英、领导人和将军以及有钱人准备的。除了积聚的灰尘，大堂区域一尘不染，几乎像一家酒店。我迅速查看了一下前台后面，有一本为撤离者准备的登记簿。有一个小柜子里放着一些访客包。我拿了两个，我和真嗣一人一个。

"Enjoy your stay at the five star NERV Shelter, live out the apocalypse in the lap of luxury. Now comes with view of giant head."  
享受您在五星级的 NERV 避难所的时光，在奢华中度过末日。现在还附赠巨型头颅景观。

I actually hear him laugh at my joke. It's a little bit creepy though, they were going to pile into this place and live out the end of days in relative luxury while the rest of humanity was supposed to what? Barely survive on the surface? Live like animals herded into badly managed civilian shelters?  
我居然听到他对我开的玩笑笑了。虽然有点诡异，他们打算挤进这个地方，在相对的奢华中度过末日，而剩下的人类呢？只能在地面勉强求生？像动物一样被赶进管理不善的平民避难所？

I open my 'visitor pack' and there is a small card in it. I suppose this is a form of access card. There is no name on it, just a number. Funnily enough I picked #002, imagine that.  
我打开我的‘访客包’，里面有一张小卡片。我想这是一种通行证。上面没有名字，只有一个编号。有趣的是，我拿到了#002，想象一下。

"Hey Shinji, what card did you get?"  
"嘿，真嗣，你抽到了什么牌？"

He reaches into his pack and pulls out his card, "One."  
他从包里掏出一张牌，"一"。

"There's a shock. Let's go."  
"真是出乎意料。我们走吧。"

I swipe my card through the access slot on the elevator and it opens with a pleasant ding. It really is like a five star hotel. The floor of the elevator is a lovely marble finish, there are gold railings attached to the walls, mirrors around it and a fine wood finish to round it off. There are four options on the control panel. G, which I presume means ground and what we're on. Then B1 through to B3. I tap B1 and watch as the doors close.  
我将卡片在电梯的读卡槽上刷过，随着一声悦耳的叮咚声，电梯门缓缓开启。这里真的宛如五星级酒店一般。电梯地板是大理石的华丽装饰，墙壁上附有金色扶手，四周镶嵌着镜子，还有精致的木质装饰作为点缀。控制面板上有四个选项：G，我想应该是地面层，也就是我们现在所在的楼层；然后是 B1 到 B3。我轻触 B1，看着电梯门缓缓关闭。

**I'm creeping back to life…  
我正慢慢恢复生机……**

My heart is beating faster in my chest as we approach the chosen floor and the door opens slowly. I'm focusing all my effort on stopping my legs from trembling. I don't want Asuka to see that I'm scared. I don't want her to know I'm scared because then she'll ask why and I'll have to tell her the reason why. Ever since we entered this place I've felt something here. I know there is no one here. Me and Asuka are the only two who have returned so far. Yet I can't help but feel like someone or something is watching us.  
随着我们接近选定的楼层，电梯门缓缓打开，我的心跳在胸腔中加速。我全神贯注地控制着双腿，不让它们颤抖。我不想让明日香看到我害怕的样子。我不想让她知道我害怕，因为那样她会问为什么，而我不得不告诉她原因。自从我们进入这个地方以来，我就感觉到这里有些什么。我知道这里没有人。我和明日香是目前仅有的两个回来的人。然而，我无法摆脱那种被某人或某物注视的感觉。

Asuka would only laugh at me if I told her that. She'd laugh and call me an idiot and make fun of me for the rest of the day. Or maybe I'm scared that she wouldn't make fun of me and instead she would take it seriously and we'd investigate it and something would be there. Someone once asked me before I went to Tokyo-3 if I believed in ghosts and I told them no. If I'm being honest I didn't really believe in anything.  
如果我跟明日香说这件事，她只会嘲笑我。她会笑我，叫我傻瓜，然后一整天都拿我开玩笑。或者也许我害怕她不会取笑我，而是会认真对待，我们会去调查，然后真的会发现些什么。有人在我去第三新东京市之前问我是否相信鬼魂，我告诉他们不相信。说实话，我那时什么都不太相信。

On my first day in Tokyo-3 I saw something appear to me. A young girl stood in the middle of the street. I had no idea who she was but when I turned to look again she was gone. I later met a girl who looked identical to her. Rei Ayanami. Except the person who appeared to me couldn't have been Rei because at that time Rei was deep underground in the hospital. So what appeared to me on that day? Was it a projection from the Rei Ayanami lying unconscious in hospital? Was it a ghost of Rei's previous body? Or was it something else? I never did get an answer.  
在我到达第三新东京市的第一天，我看到了一个幻象。一个年轻女孩站在街道中央。我不知道她是谁，但当我再次转头看时，她已经消失了。后来我遇到了一个和她长得一模一样的女孩。绫波零。但出现在我面前的人不可能是绫波零，因为那时她正深陷地下医院中。那么那天出现在我面前的是什么？是躺在医院里昏迷不醒的绫波零的投影吗？是她前世的鬼魂吗？还是别的什么？我始终没有得到答案。

The day before Asuka returned I saw the apparition again. Stood floating over the water. I put that one down to a hallucination. I had just been sick, I was tired and delirious so it was easy to think I'd hallucinate something like that. I wonder now though what was it I saw on that day? Projection? Ghost of Rei? Lilith? Once again I don't think I'll get an answer.  
在明日香回来前一天，我又看到了那个幻影。它悬浮在水面上。我当时病了，疲惫且神志不清，所以很容易认为那只是幻觉。但现在我好奇那天我看到的究竟是什么？是投影？丽的精神体？莉莉丝？再次，我想我得不到答案。

So do I believe in ghosts now? They wouldn't be the strangest thing I've seen since arriving in Tokyo-3 and becoming an Evangelion pilot. I just wonder if maybe the ghosts of people who died during Third Impact are watching us now. Maybe for some reason they can't come back and they're angry at me and Asuka for what we're doing.  
那么我现在相信鬼魂吗？自从来到第三新东京市成为 EVA 驾驶员以来，我所见过的奇怪事物已经够多了。我只是想知道，那些在第三次冲击中死去的人的鬼魂是否正在看着我们。也许出于某种原因他们无法回来，并对我和明日香正在做的事情感到愤怒。

"You're scared aren't you?"  
“你害怕了，对吧？”

Her voice makes me jump and snaps me away from my thoughts. All I can do is nod, she holds out her hand for me to take hold of.  
她的声音让我一惊，将我从思绪中拉回。我只能点头，她伸出手让我握住。

"Don't be. We're the only ones here. Besides I'll protect you!"  
“别怕。这里只有我们俩。再说了，我会保护你的！”

Her words, her smile, her confidence, it always manages to make me feel better somehow. I take her hand and we walk down the corridor of the shelter. It's really warm here.  
她的话语、她的微笑、她的自信，总能以某种方式让我感觉好些。我握住她的手，我们沿着避难所的走廊走去。这里真的很温暖。

Asuka made a joke before we were above ground about this place but it's starting to sink in that her joke is closer to the truth. This place is exactly how I'd imagine a five star hotel to be. Aside from a bit of dust from weeks of no one being in here it's pristine. The corridor stretches on for a long way breaking off into other separate corridors. Each one having a number beside it which I presume relates to the key we have. Along the way are little storage cupboards containing cleaning materials, vacuums, that sort of thing.  
在我们到达地面之前，明日香开了个关于这个地方的玩笑，但现在我开始意识到她的玩笑更接近真相。这个地方完全符合我对五星级酒店的想象。除了几周无人居住积下的少许灰尘外，这里一尘不染。走廊延伸得很远，分支出其他独立的走廊。每条走廊旁都有一个数字，我猜这和我们手中的钥匙有关。沿途还有一些小储物柜，里面装着清洁用品、吸尘器之类的东西。

We continue to move through the maze of corridors. About midway through there is a large set of double door with no number attached. Asuka pushes them open and we find ourselves standing in what appears to be a bar. There are a large number of tables set out in the centre with seats around them. At the back of the room is a stage, off to one of the sides is a bar. Behind it we can see the cabinets stocked with various drinks.  
我们继续穿梭在这迷宫般的走廊中。大约走到一半时，有一扇没有编号的大双开门。明日香推开门，我们发现自己站在一个看起来像是酒吧的地方。中央摆放着许多桌子和椅子，房间后面有一个舞台，一侧是一个吧台。吧台后面可以看到摆满各种酒的柜子。

"I guess when Misato comes back, she'll have somewhere to come."  
“我想当美里回来时，她会有个地方可以来。”

I smirk at Asuka's comment. We make our way over to the bar, next to it is a small door that leads into a proper restaurant style kitchen. I have no idea if the fridges or cupboards in here are stocked but there appears to be a complete set of equipment and the power appears to be on. If we had the ingredients I could cook us something in here.  
我对明日香的话微微一笑。我们走向吧台，旁边有一扇小门通向一个正式的餐厅式厨房。我不知道这里的冰箱或橱柜是否有存货，但看起来有一整套设备，而且电源似乎是通的。如果有食材的话，我可以在这里为我们做点吃的。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

I turn around and see she is stood by the doorway looking out amongst all of the empty seats towards the stage. There is a scowl across her face.  
我转过身，看到她站在门口，目光穿过所有空座位望向舞台。她的脸上带着怒容。

"Is everything alright?" "一切都还好吗？"

"They… were just going to come here and live like this. In this luxury whilst the rest of the world suffered weren't they?"  
“他们……原本打算就这样来这里生活。在这个奢华的环境中，而世界其他地方却在受苦，不是吗？”

I nod and recall the time I spent in the civilian shelter in Tokyo-3. It was the second time I had quit NERV. Shortly after I was due to go back to where I used to live an Angel attacked and I had to go to the civilian shelter there. I remember them being cramped, dark and very hot. I remember hearing the children crying because they didn't know what was going on. I remember hearing the anger of the adults and the tremors from the fighting. I remember feeling so guilty throughout all of it because I was sat there feeling sorry for myself while I could have been out there fighting and doing something.  
我点头，回想起在东京-3 的平民避难所度过的时光。这是我第二次离开 NERV。原本我即将回到以前居住的地方，却遭遇了使徒的袭击，不得不前往那里的平民避难所。我记得那里拥挤、昏暗且异常闷热。我听到孩子们因不知所措而哭泣。我听到大人们的愤怒和战斗引发的震动。我记得在整个过程中，我感到无比内疚，因为我坐在那里自怨自艾，而本可以出去战斗，做些什么。

"This isn't right is it?"  
“这样不对，是吧？”

Asuka shakes her head, "No… it isn't. Come on let's continue looking around."  
明日香摇摇头，“不……不对。来吧，我们继续四处看看。”

We continue exploring the floor finding a conference room in one section. Beyond that it is mostly the same all the way around. I realize that the fear I felt when we entered the room has gone. I'm no longer fearing any 'ghosts', instead I'm feeling... I suppose anger would be the best way to describe it.  
我们继续探索这一层，在某个区域发现了一间会议室。除此之外，周围基本上都是千篇一律。我意识到，当我们进入房间时感受到的恐惧已经消失了。我不再害怕任何‘幽灵’，取而代之的是一种感觉……我想，用愤怒来形容最为贴切。

I'm actually angry that this place exists in the form it does. I can't help but think what if there were people here now. Would the world be scavenging on the surface like we are? While the leaders and people in power, people like my father lived comfortably in here. Would they continue to lead from here or leave the others to it?  
实际上，我对这个地方以这样的形式存在感到愤怒。我不禁思考，如果现在这里有人会怎样？世界是否还会像我们一样在地面上搜寻物资？而那些领导者和掌权者，像我父亲那样的人，却能在这里舒适地生活。他们会继续从这里领导，还是让其他人自生自灭？

Eventually we come to a stop close to the elevator we came down on. We're standing at the door of one of the rooms. Room two. There is a card reader next to the door and Asuka is looking at it whilst clutching her 'welcome pack' in her hand. I realize that we're actually still holding hands. Aside from the few moments when we explore the kitchen we've been holding hands the entire time. It's strange, her hand is warm and feeling her fingers intertwined with mine feels so natural.  
最终，我们停在了我们下来的电梯附近。我们站在一个房间的门前，房间号是二号。门旁有一个卡片阅读器，明日香正盯着它看，同时紧握着她手中的‘欢迎包’。我意识到我们实际上还一直牵着手。除了探索厨房的那几个瞬间，我们一直牵着手。这很奇怪，她的手很温暖，她的手指与我的交缠在一起，感觉如此自然。

Asuka swipes her card and the door to the room opens. The room as with the rest of this facility is luxurious. I can actually feel the heat increase as I enter the room. This is more like a luxury apartment than it is a hotel room. I expect they were planning to have families stay here so they had to build the rooms accordingly. The first room we enter is a typical passageway but that quickly opens up to a spacious living room. It's already been furnished with a three seat sofa, armchair and a coffee table. On one of the walls is a flat-screen television hooked up to what looks like a games console and a DVD player.  
明日香刷了卡，房间的门随之打开。这间房和设施的其他部分一样，奢华至极。我一进门就能感受到温度的上升。这里与其说是酒店房间，不如说更像豪华公寓。我猜他们原本打算让家庭入住，所以房间必须相应地建造。我们首先进入的是一个典型的过道，但很快便豁然开朗，变成了一个宽敞的客厅。客厅里已经摆放了一张三人沙发、一把扶手椅和一张咖啡桌。其中一面墙上挂着一台平板电视，连接着看似游戏机和 DVD 播放器的设备。

At the other side of the room it extends into a small kitchen. It has a fridge, freezer, oven, everything people would need I guess. As with the rest of what we have seen an effort has been made to make this place look as high-end as possible. Marble-finishes on the worktops and tiling, expensive looking artwork hung up on the walls, high-end furniture. People would pay a fortune for a place like this in the old world.  
房间的另一侧延伸出一个小型厨房。冰箱、冰柜、烤箱，应有尽有，我想人们所需的一切这里都有。与我们所见的一切一样，这里也尽力营造出高端的氛围。工作台和瓷砖采用大理石饰面，墙上挂着看起来昂贵的艺术品，家具也是高端品牌。在旧世界，人们会为这样一个地方付出巨额资金。

This particular apartment has two bedrooms. There is also a bathroom complete with a full bath and shower. We finish exploring the room and I'm a little bit unsure of what to say. All I know is that I know this doesn't feel right. This being here is wrong. My mind flashes back to the time I spent in that other shelter. It shows me all of their faces. All of the faces of people who are gone now because of me.  
这套特定的公寓有两间卧室。还有一个配备齐全的浴室，包括浴缸和淋浴。我们探索完房间后，我有点不知道该说什么。我只知道我感觉这不对劲。它在这里是错误的。我的思绪闪回到我在那个避难所度过的时光。它向我展示了所有那些面孔。所有那些因我而逝去的人的面孔。

I can't get that thought out of my mind. For the past few weeks we've been living in a world with no people. All of them gone, all of them out there. I suddenly get the feeling that I'm being watched again. I'm sure I can see someone out of the corner of my eye. Not just someone, a group of people. A family. A mother, a father, a child. All of them standing and looking directly at me. They could have been living in the town we're staying in, they could have been living in Tokyo-3 and now they're gone.  
我无法摆脱这个念头。过去几周我们一直生活在一个没有人的世界里。他们全都消失了，都在外面。我突然又有了被监视的感觉。我确信我能用眼角瞥见某个人。不只是一个人，而是一群人。一个家庭。一位母亲，一位父亲，一个孩子。他们都站在那里，直直地看着我。他们可能一直生活在我们暂住的城镇，也可能住在东京-3，而现在他们都不在了。

Why am I thinking about this now? I can't think like that, Asuka said... she said people will return. She keeps on saying that when people return. Not if, she keeps on being there for me.  
为什么我现在会想这些？我不能那样想，明日香说过...她说人们会回来的。她总是这么说，当人们回来时。不是如果，她一直在我身边。

The heat in the room suddenly feels unbearable. I look at Asuka and she doesn't seem to be showing any signs of feeling hot at all. She's looking at me oddly as I feel a churning in the pit of my stomach. I suddenly realize I'm having trouble breathing, my vision is hazy and I can hear a voice. I stumble forward  
房间里的热度突然变得难以忍受。我看向明日香，她似乎一点也没有感到热。她奇怪地看着我，我感到胃里一阵翻腾。我突然意识到自己呼吸困难，视线模糊，还能听到一个声音。我踉跄着向前走去。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

**Look at him now, he's paler somehow…  
看看他现在，不知怎么地脸色更苍白了……**

I feel Shinjis hand tighten around mine and I immediately wrap an arm around his front to catch him as he falls forward. I feel him twitch and immediately rush him into the bathroom. I gently rub his back but can't help but turn away somewhat grossed out by his throwing up.  
我感觉到新治的手紧紧握住我的手，我立刻用一只手臂环住他的前胸，扶住他向前倒下的身体。我感觉到他在抽搐，立刻把他扶进浴室。我轻轻地揉着他的背，但忍不住有些恶心地转过头去，因为他开始呕吐。

I wait for him to stop before helping him clean up and aiding him into one of the bedrooms. I settle him down and press the back of my hand against his forehead. He's boiling hot. I wonder if maybe he has caught something.  
我等他停下来，然后帮他清理干净，扶他进了一间卧室。我让他躺下，用手背试了试他的额头。他烫得厉害。我在想他是不是感染了什么。

I hear him mutter, "I'm sorry..."  
我听到他喃喃自语：“对不起……”

I can see a tear trickling down his face as I brush it away softly.  
我看到一滴泪顺着他的脸颊滑落，便轻轻地替他拭去。

"You should have told me you weren't feeling well Shinji, I wouldn't have brought you here if I knew that."  
"你应该早点告诉我你不舒服的，真嗣。如果我知道，就不会带你来这里了。"

"Was... feeling fine before we entered here... then it came on suddenly... I was thinking."  
"在我们进来之前...我还感觉挺好的...然后突然就...我开始思考。"

I can't help but laugh, I should have known. I quickly excuse myself from the room and dig through the kitchen for water for him before returning to the room. Shinji has sat himself up. I already know what has happened. I thought he seemed off when he entered here but the trip to the graveyard, mixed in with coming here has affected him again. It's like what happened before I turned up, well fortunately for him I'm here now.  
我不禁笑了起来，我早该料到的。我迅速离开房间，在厨房里翻找给他找水，然后回到房间。真嗣已经坐了起来。我已经知道发生了什么。他进门时我就觉得他状态不对，但去墓地的那趟，再加上来这里，又让他受到了影响。就像我出现之前发生的那样，不过幸好现在我在这里。

"Feeling better?" "感觉好些了吗？"

He shakes his head, "A little bit... I guess, I'm... sorry... You're probably pretty disgusted with me..."  
他摇摇头，"有点吧...我想，我...对不起...你可能对我很反感..."

"Don't be stupid, I'm not disgusted with you."  
"别傻了，我对你没有反感。"

I sit next to him, the bed is ridiculously comfortable, and reach for his hand. I want to ask him what he was thinking of but I don't want to make him feel any worse than he already does. I feel a little bit guilty. We shouldn't have come here yet, we should have waited a bit longer until we were both a bit more prepared for it. After my breakdown the night before and Shinjis visit to the memorials he had set up earlier it's no wonder this has happened to him. Once again my eagerness, my need to do something has hurt him. Oh well, it's not the end of the world. This time anyway.  
我坐在他旁边，床舒适得离谱，伸手去握他的手。我想问他当时在想什么，但又不想让他感觉更糟。我感到有些内疚。我们本不该这么早来这里，应该再等一段时间，等我们都准备得更充分些。前一晚我崩溃了，而新治去看了他之前设立的纪念碑，难怪他会这样。又一次，我的急切，我想要做些什么的冲动，伤害了他。不过，好吧，这还不是世界末日。至少这次不是。

So instead of asking about what he thought I ask something stupid.  
所以，我没有问他当时的想法，而是问了个愚蠢的问题。

"So... what do you make of it?"  
“那么……你怎么看？”

"Of what?" "怕什么？"

"This place of course, the five-star shelter for the rich and famous. Do you reckon we should move in? Think about it, we'd have everything we need here. Kitchens, food, running water, and it'd all be free! What do you think, the people who saved the world deserve a bit of luxury right?"  
“这个地方嘛，当然是专为名流显贵打造的五星级避难所。你觉得我们该搬进来吗？想想看，这里应有尽有：厨房、食物、自来水，而且统统免费！你说呢，拯救了世界的人难道不该享受点奢华吗？”

He smiles and wipes another tear from his face, "I... can't believe this was here. I was expecting something similar to the other shelters but... not this."  
他微笑着拭去脸上的泪水，“我……真不敢相信这里存在。我本以为会是类似其他避难所的地方，但……不是这样的。”

There is a disdain in his voice which actually pleases me. I'm not entirely happy that a place like this exists either. I can of course understand it. I saw the way the others in NERV were when an Angel attacked. How they would give orders from safety while we fought on the front lines. I didn't have a problem with the fighting. After all that was my purpose, that was how I proved my existence but having them critique me while they sat in safety behind desks away from it all always rattled me.  
他语气中的轻蔑反而让我感到一丝欣慰。我也不完全认同这种地方的存在。当然，我能理解其中的缘由。我见过 NERV 的其他人面对使徒袭击时的样子，他们从安全地带发号施令，而我们却在最前线战斗。战斗本身我并不介意，毕竟那是我的使命，是我证明自己存在的方式，但他们在安全桌后对我评头论足，这总让我心神不宁。

This was likely going to be the same. The leaders would come here, the rich, the generals and the powerful would live here. Access to all amenities while the rest of the world had to make do with the ruined world up above. Jokes on them I guess, we're all equally fucked now aren't we. The only ones who have access to this place are two teenagers.  
这很可能也会是同样的情况。领导者们会来到这里，富人们、将军们、权贵们将在此居住。他们享有所有便利设施，而世界其他地方的人只能勉强应付地表那片废墟。现在看来，笑话在他们身上，我们不都一样倒霉吗？能进入这个地方的，只有两个青少年。

Actually thinking about it gives me an idea. I know of maybe one or two more of these shelters. I don't know if they're exactly the same as this one but I'd presume so. There must be about a thousand rooms per shelter. When people come back we can bring them here. I've flicked through the leaflet in the welcome pack. This place was made to be self-sustaining, it has running water, electricity, everything we would need.  
仔细想想，我倒有个主意。我知道或许还有一两个类似的避难所。虽然我不确定它们是否和这里完全一样，但估计差不多。每个避难所大约有一千个房间。等人们回来时，我们可以带他们来这里。我在迎新包的宣传册上翻阅过，这个地方设计成自给自足，有自来水、电力，以及我们所需的一切。

I guess we just have to wait until people eventually come back. For now I think we've explored enough of this place. Shinji is my priority, I don't want to put him through anymore today.  
我想我们只能等待，直到人们最终回来。目前我认为我们已经探索得够多了。真嗣是我的首要任务，我不想让他今天再承受更多了。

**But he's coming around… 但他正在逐渐恢复……**

Asuka adjusts the seat slightly and switches on the car's engine. She insisted on driving us back to town. I did tell her I was feeling better but I guess the paleness and trembling of my legs betrayed me. I am feeling better though, I suppose just being in that confined space, the heat I was feeling along with the guilt just got to me and knocked me sick. I know I shouldn't be but I'm also really embarrassed as Asuka seeing me be sick as well.  
明日香稍微调整了一下座椅，启动了汽车的引擎。她坚持要开车送我们回镇上。我确实告诉她我感觉好多了，但我想我苍白的脸色和颤抖的双腿出卖了我。不过，我的确感觉好些了，可能只是在那狭小的空间里，伴随着内疚感的热度让我一时不适。我知道我不该这样，但看到明日香目睹我生病的样子，我也感到非常尴尬。

The window on my side of the car goes down slightly and I look across to catch a small smile from Asuka.  
我这边的车窗微微降下，我转头望去，捕捉到了明日香嘴角的一抹微笑。

"You sure you're feeling alright?"  
"你确定你感觉还好吗？"

I nod, "Yeah I'm fine… sorry for what happened…"  
我点点头，"嗯，我没事……对不起刚才发生的事……"

She sighs and the car rolls away. As we get further away from the place I notice I'm feeling a lot better. I guess being in that environment was affecting me more than I thought. After a short time driving she turns to me and speaks.  
她叹了口气，车子缓缓驶离。随着我们离那个地方越来越远，我发现自己感觉好多了。看来那个环境对我的影响比我想象的要大。开车没多久，她转向我，开口说道。

"You mind if we stop somewhere? Or are you still feeling a bit off?"  
"介意我们找个地方停一下吗？还是你还在感觉不太舒服？"

I'm wondering where she would want to stop. I don't really mind. I'm feeling a lot better now. If anything I could probably manage some food too although I expect Asuka is going to have me on a diet of crackers until she is sure I'm completely right again.  
我在想她会想在哪里停下。我其实不太介意。我现在感觉好多了。如果有需要，我可能还能吃点东西，尽管我猜明日香会让我一直吃饼干，直到她确定我完全恢复为止。

"I'm alright, feeling a lot better now."  
"我没事，现在感觉好多了。"

"Good." "很好。"

After another five or so minutes Asuka starts to slow the car down and pulls into a parking lot of a supermarket. Was this where she wanted to make a stop, we don't need any supplies we already have a grocery store underneath us with a good amount of items.  
又过了大约五分钟，明日香开始减速并将车开进了一个超市的停车场。她想在这里停一下吗？我们不需要任何补给，我们楼下已经有了一家杂货店，里面存货充足。

"What are we doing here?"  
“我们来这儿干嘛？”

"You'll see." “你会看到的。”

Asuka walks over and grabs a trolley nearby and approaches the door. As expected it doesn't open on our approach.  
明日香走过去，顺手推了一辆购物车，向门口走去。不出所料，门在我们靠近时并没有打开。

"Shinji, stand back." “真嗣，站远点。”

"Huh, why?" “咦，为什么？”

Without any warning she shoves the trolley forward with force towards the door shattering the glass from the frame completely.  
她毫无预警地用力将手推车推向门，彻底击碎了门框上的玻璃。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

She turns to me and shrugs apologetically, "Oops?"  
她转向我，抱歉地耸了耸肩，“哎呀？”

I know it's a necessity, I know why we have to do it but I don't think I'll ever get used to having to break into these places. It just doesn't feel right, I know Asuka is right when she says we have to do it but I can tell that there is a part of her that doesn't feel right about it either.  
我知道这是必要的，我明白我们为什么必须这么做，但我总觉得无法习惯闯入这些地方。就是感觉不对劲，我知道明日香说得对，我们必须这么做，但我能感觉到她内心也有一部分对此感到不安。

We enter the supermarket and a strange smell fills my nostrils. I suppose with no power and it having been like this for a few weeks the food in the freezers and the fresh food has started to gone off somewhat. It isn't a pleasing smell and I'm hoping we won't be in here for too long.  
我们进入超市，一股怪味扑鼻而来。我想，没有电力供应，这种情况已经持续了几周，冷冻食品和新鲜食物已经开始变质了。这味道并不好闻，我希望我们不会在这里待太久。

Asuka bypasses all of the food sections, even the tinned goods and heads straight to the entertainment section. She stops and starts looking at the boxes of Blu Ray Players before picking one up and depositing it in the trolley. Almost immediately my guilt kicks in.  
明日香绕过了所有的食品区，甚至连罐头食品都不看一眼，径直走向娱乐区。她停下脚步，开始查看蓝光播放器的盒子，然后拿起一个放进购物车。几乎立刻，我的内疚感就涌了上来。

"Asuka what are yo-" "绫波，你在做什么-"

"I know, I know! We're going ever so slightly against what we agreed on but we have enough power now, we have enough resources and places to get them and I think we've been through enough and deserve a little bit of entertainment. Wouldn't you agree? Come on, I'll even let you pick the first movie."  
"我知道，我知道！我们有点违背了之前的约定，但我们现在有足够的能量，有足够的资源和地方获取它们，我觉得我们已经经历了这么多，值得享受一点娱乐。你不同意吗？来吧，我甚至让你先选电影。"

As always she makes a persuasive argument. I sigh and follow her into the aisle containing the movies and CDs. Almost immediately she goes over to the CDs leaving me to pick a selection of movies. I look across and wonder what Asuka would like to watch.  
一如既往，她提出了一个有说服力的论点。我叹了口气，跟着她走进了摆放电影和 CD 的过道。她几乎立刻就走向了 CD 区，留下我挑选电影。我环顾四周，思考着绫波会喜欢看什么。

"Hey Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

She deposits the CDs she's grabbed into the trolley and looks over, "Yeah…"  
她将抓起的 CD 放入购物车，转头看去，“嗯……”

"What… what should I get?"  
“我……我该拿些什么？”

"I thought I said I'd leave it up to you!"  
“我以为我说过让你决定！”

"Yeah but… I don't know what you like."  
"是啊，但是……我不知道你喜欢什么。"

"Well what options are there?"  
"那有哪些选择呢？"

I look at the films on offer and list the names to Asuka.  
我看着提供的电影，把名字一一念给明日香听。

"Well we can probably skip any of the giant monster or disaster movies for now, I think we've had enough of that for a lifetime."  
"嗯，我们或许可以暂时跳过那些巨型怪兽或灾难电影，我觉得我们这辈子已经受够了这些。"

"There's a documentary about penguins?"  
"有关于企鹅的纪录片吗？"

She shrugs, "That sounds cute, let's go for that. I'll grab a few things too."  
她耸耸肩，"听起来很可爱，我们就看这个吧。我再去拿点东西。"

I pick up the box and place it in the trolley along with the numerous other items Asuka has placed in there. Most of the CDs are bands I don't recognize the name of. There are a few I do know from the time I accidentally put Asuka's music player in my bag for school. I wonder if maybe I should get a few CDs myself. I could maybe get a new music player too while I'm here.  
我拿起盒子，把它和其他许多明日香放进推车里的物品放在一起。大多数 CD 的乐队名字我都不认识。有几张我倒是知道，那是因为有一次我不小心把明日香的音乐播放器放进了我的书包里带去学校。我在想，也许我也该买几张 CD。或许在这里我还能顺便买个新的音乐播放器。

"Hey Asuka do you…" “嘿，明日香，你……”

"Mm?

"…do you think they have music players in here? I need to replace my SDAT."  
“……你觉得这里会有音乐播放器吗？我需要换掉我的 SDAT。”

She looks at me and laughs, "Finally upgrading to something modern eh?"  
她看着我，笑着说：“终于要升级到现代设备了，嗯？”

I nod, "Yeah… my SDAT kinda had… Third Impact happen to it."  
我点点头，“是啊……我的 SDAT 有点……经历了第三次冲击。”

I try not to let her know but the idea of my SDAT being gone is a little bit sad to me. It was one of the only things I had left of my mother. It used to be hers, the tracks on it were what she had put on. It was one of the only things I had that had any connection to her. My father had gotten rid of everything else.  
"我尽量不让她知道，但我的 SDAT 消失了一点让我感到难过。这是我仅剩的关于母亲的纪念品之一。它曾经是她的，里面的曲目也是她放进去的。这是我与她唯一的联系之一。父亲已经把其他东西都处理掉了。”

"Wait there a moment." "在那儿等一会儿。"

Asuka disappears into another aisle and returns a few moments later, she's carrying a box and puts it in the trolley without letting me look at it.  
明日香消失在另一个货架间，几分钟后回来，手里拿着一个盒子，不让我看就放进了购物车。

"Sorted, let's head back."  
"搞定了，我们回去吧。"

"But-" “但是——”

"Don't worry about it, sorted it for you but you have to wait until we get back to see it."  
"别担心，已经帮你搞定了，不过得等到我们回去才能看到。"

**Now we can hear ourselves again  
现在我们又能听见彼此的声音了**

I pull the blanket up around us as we sit on the couch and let my head rest gently on Shinji's shoulder as we watch the penguins hop about on the television. The narrator's voice informing us of what this group must do in order to survive and the perilous travels up ahead.  
我拉起毯子把我们裹住，坐在沙发上，头轻轻靠在真嗣的肩膀上，一起看着电视上跳来跳去的企鹅。旁白的声音告诉我们这群企鹅为了生存必须做什么，以及前方充满危险的旅程。

Since we returned it's been nice. Shinji has been fine, I made sure of that of course. It's the least I can do for dragging him out there. Now we're sat happily watching television. It's warm, we're snuggling up and the curtains drawn. There is only the light from the television providing us with any light. From this environment it's easy to forget that we're the only two people in the world right now.  
自从我们回来后，一切都变得美好。真嗣状态不错，我当然确保了这一点。毕竟是我把他带出去的。现在我们正开心地坐在电视机前。屋里温暖，我们依偎在一起，窗帘紧闭。唯一的光源来自电视屏幕。在这样的环境中，很容易忘记现在世界上只有我们两个人。

I wonder if penguins have returned.  
不知道企鹅们是否已经回来了。

### Chapter 6
I've been thinking a lot lately about failure and about saying the right things. Since we returned I've been careful to say the right things to Shinji. Instead of saying 'if people come back' I've been saying 'when people come back'. It's not that I don't believe those words it's just I need us to remain positive, I need Shinji to remain positive because I don't want to fail him again. Not like I did during Third Impact when he reached out to me. I failed him in the worst way because he needed me at that moment and I gave him nothing.  
最近我一直在思考失败，以及如何说出恰当的话。自从我们回来后，我一直在小心翼翼地对真嗣说正确的话。我没有说“如果人们回来”，而是说“当人们回来”。并非我不相信这些话，只是我需要我们保持积极，我需要真嗣保持积极，因为我不想再次让他失望。不像在第三次冲击时他向我伸出手，我却什么也没给他。那一刻他需要我，我却以最糟糕的方式让他失望了。

The truth is I needed him at that moment as well. I needed him to reach out to me but I was angry. Angry that he hadn't done anything in that battle against the Eva series. I was angry that he had sat there and not even tried so when he did what I wanted him to I rejected him. I made him want to end the world. I said the wrong thing, I made the wrong choice and it resulted in the world nearly ending. When did my life become a series of crushing failures and defeats?  
事实是，那一刻我也需要他。我需要他向我伸出援手，但我很生气。生气他在对抗 Eva 系列的那场战斗中什么也没做。我气他坐在那里，甚至没有尝试，所以当他做了我希望他做的事时，我拒绝了他。我让他想要毁灭世界。我说错了话，做出了错误的选择，结果差点导致世界末日。我的生活何时变成了一连串的失败和挫败？

I'm not going to let it happen this time. So when I say 'when people come back' I mean it, I believe it. When I say I'm going to look after and protect Shinji, I mean it and I believe it. Yet as we enter the second week of February, six weeks after we returned I wonder if my words are having the same effect on Shinji that they used to.  
这次我不会让它发生的。所以当我提到‘当人们回来时’，我是认真的，我相信这一点。当我承诺要照顾和保护真嗣时，我是认真的，我相信这一点。然而，当我们进入二月的第二周，距离我们回来已经六周了，我不禁怀疑我的话对真嗣是否还有以前那样的影响。

He keeps on asking what we'll do if no one does return. He keeps on looking out sadly to that sea of LCL and sighing. All I can do is tell him they'll return when they're ready, we still don't know about the rest of the world. We haven't tried to contact anyone outside of this area yet. The whole world could be out there right now thriving and we'd know nothing about it. We've stuck close to this area, living off of our scavenged goods and watching movies.  
他不停地问如果没有人回来我们会怎么办。他不停地悲伤地望向那片 LCL 海洋，叹息着。我只能告诉他，当他们准备好时就会回来，我们仍然不知道世界的其他地方怎么样了。我们还没有尝试联系这个区域以外的人。整个世界可能就在那里繁荣发展，而我们却一无所知。我们一直待在这个区域附近，靠我们捡来的物资生活，看着电影。

Yet I can see him growing sadder and I don't know if I can keep on lifting his spirits. I've even contemplated doing things with him. In the evenings when I see his eyes drop I think about reaching over to him. I think about looking deep into his eyes and kissing him. I think about sliding my hand up his shirt and then down into his trousers. I think about making him feel really good before he returns the favour. I spend a lot of time in the bath with those thoughts praying that Shinji can't hear my moans.  
然而，我能看到他越来越悲伤，我不知道我是否能继续提振他的精神。我甚至考虑过和他做些事情。晚上，当我看到他的眼睛低垂时，我想过伸手过去。我想过深深地凝视他的眼睛并亲吻他。我想过将手滑进他的衬衫，然后伸进他的裤子。我想过让他先感到非常愉快，然后再回报我。我花了很多时间在浴缸里，带着这些念头祈祷真嗣听不到我的呻吟。

I'm sure he has been doing the same. I've noticed things when we hold each other. When we snuggle into each other. I've noticed the time he spends in the shower. Or maybe I'm just inventing more fantasies.  
我确信他也在做同样的事情。当我们拥抱彼此时，我注意到了一些事情。当我们依偎在一起时。我注意到了他在淋浴间花费的时间。或者也许我只是又在编织更多的幻想。

I look across at him as I park the car up. We're back from another trip to the shelter just out of town. We've made a couple of visits there since our first. Exploring it and its various amenities. We discovered the shelter has facilities to grow and cultivate food. I'm not sure how it works but when people return we can use that for replenishing supplies. We found a few conference rooms in there which we presume are for the various leaders to hold meetings about important matters not concerning the little people.  
我把车停好，转头看向他。我们刚从城外的一个避难所回来。自从第一次去那里后，我们又去了几次，探索了它的各种设施。我们发现避难所里有种植和培育食物的设施。我不太清楚它是如何运作的，但当人们回来时，我们可以利用它来补充物资。我们在那里还找到了几个会议室，推测是供各位领导人召开不涉及普通民众的重要会议用的。

There appears to be some communications equipment in there for contacting the outside world along with the other shelters. We haven't touched it yet. I haven't wanted to just yet, I think we should wait a little bit longer for people to come back. I still haven't told Shinji about my idea to invent new names for ourselves. I don't want to scare him with the knowledge that people out there might not find out existence too favourable.  
那里似乎有一些通讯设备，可以用来与外界和其他避难所联系。我们还没碰过它。我暂时还不想碰，我觉得我们应该再等一段时间，等人们回来。我还没告诉真嗣我关于为我们自己创造新名字的想法。我不想让他知道，外面的人可能不会对我们存在感到太友好。

We exit the car and head towards the apartment. Almost immediately my eyes are drawn to the door of the shop below. It's open slightly. I pause and place my arm out to halt Shinji too.  
我们下车走向公寓。几乎立刻，我的目光就被楼下商店的门吸引了。门微微开着。我停下脚步，伸出胳膊拦住了真嗣。

"Shinji look!" “真嗣，看！”

He looks ahead and finally notices the door, "The door… it's… open! Do you think…?"  
他向前看去，终于注意到了那扇门，“那扇门……它……开着！你觉得……？”

I nod slowly, "Someone's returned."  
我缓缓点头，“有人回来了。”

He rushes forward and I pull him back, "Wait you idiot we can't just rush in there!"  
他冲上前去，我一把将他拉回，“等等，你这个傻瓜，我们不能就这样冲进去！”

He turns around and looks at me, "What do you mean?"  
他转过身来盯着我，“你什么意思？”

Sometimes I forget how much of an idiot he can be. "That could be anyone in there Shinji, it might be someone we know but… what if it's one of those JSSDF goons who was sent to NERV to kill us? We… should be careful. Follow me."  
有时候我真忘了他有多傻。“里面可能是任何人，真嗣，可能是我们认识的人，但也可能是……那些被派到 NERV 来杀我们的 JSSDF 的家伙。我们应该小心点，跟我来。”

I reach into the bag I'm carrying and take out the crowbar I carry around with me. I take a deep breath and hope that whoever is in there is someone we know. My crowbar is perfect for breaking us into places and getting us things but I don't… I can't use it against someone. I already had to fight humans once and I don't feel good about it. I was in an Eva then though, this would be in person. Oh god please let it be someone we know.  
我伸手进随身携带的包里，掏出那根我总是带在身边的撬棍。深吸一口气，希望里面的人是我们认识的。我的撬棍非常适合帮我们闯入地方和获取物品，但我不想……我不能用它对付某个人。我曾经不得不与人类战斗过一次，那感觉并不好。那时我驾驶着 Eva，这次却是亲自上阵。哦，上帝，请让那是个我们认识的人。

With Shinji behind me I edge forward towards the store. We must look so stupid right now. My hand tightens around the weapon as we get closer and closer. We're at the door now and I can see a figure stood inside. An older man, tall with grey hair. I open the door just in time for him to turn around and I immediately drop the crowbar in shock at who it is.  
在真嗣的跟随下，我小心翼翼地向店铺靠近。我们现在看起来一定很蠢。随着我们越来越近，我的手紧紧握住武器。我们已经到了门口，我能看到里面站着一个身影。一个年长的男人，高大，灰白头发。我及时打开门，他转过身来，我立刻震惊地丢下了撬棍。

Of all the people to return first, I would not have expected him. I hear a gasp from Shinji next to me and immediately turn to him.  
在所有可能先回来的人中，我绝不会想到是他。我听到真嗣在我旁边倒吸一口气，立刻转向他。

"Shinji go to our apartment."  
"真嗣，去我们的公寓。"

He starts to protest, "But Asuka I-"  
他开始抗议，"但是明日香，我——"

"Just do it." "照做就是了。"

I snap back at him, maybe a little bit too forceful but I'm in no mood to argue. I'm not having this man come within any distance of Shinji. Not after all he is responsible for. I turn around.  
我厉声回敬他，或许有些过于强硬，但我此刻毫无争论的心情。我绝不允许这个男人靠近真嗣半步。毕竟，他所做的一切罪行，我都铭记在心。我转身离开。

"Please, just do it. I'll make it up to you later."  
“请，就这么做吧。我稍后会补偿你的。”

I'm not quite sure how I'll make it up to him, I don't even know why I said that but I just wanted Shinji away for the moment while I dealt with our guest. Shinji leaves and I hear him enter the door to the staircase leading to our apartment. When I'm sure he is gone I turn towards the guest.  
我不太确定如何补偿他，甚至不明白自己为何会这么说，但此刻我只希望真嗣能暂时离开，让我处理这位不速之客。真嗣离开后，我听到他走进通往我们公寓的楼梯门。确认他离开后，我转向那位客人。

"Sub Commander Fuyutsuki."  
“副指挥官冬月。”

He stares at me looking me up and down. There is something in his eyes, I'm not sure if it's fear or something else but finally he speaks. "Pilot Sohryu"  
他盯着我上下打量。他的眼神中有种东西，我不确定那是恐惧还是别的什么，但最终他开口了。“碇君”

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"My name is Asuka, I'm not 'Pilot Sohryu' anymore. I haven't been for at least a month and a half now. I'm just Asuka now."  
“我叫明日香，不再是‘碇君’了。至少一个半月以来，我就只是明日香。”

"I see, well I guess you can call me Kozo"  
"我明白了，好吧，你可以叫我高藏。"

There are a great many things I'd like to call this man, most of them unpleasant but for the sake of civility I go along with him. I'm stunned to see this man here. I thought he along with Gendo and Ritsuko would have never returned. They were too weak-willed, they were happy to work towards Third Impact. I wonder why he has returned, maybe his paradise wasn't what it seemed.  
我有很多话想对这个男人说，大多数都不太好听，但为了礼貌起见，我还是顺着他。看到他在这里，我感到震惊。我以为他和源堂、律子永远不会回来了。他们意志太薄弱，乐于推动第三次冲击。我想知道他为什么回来，也许他的天堂并不像看起来那样。

"I didn't expect you of all people to return."  
"我没想到你居然会回来。"

I'm not sure if he is taken aback by my words, maybe even a little bit offended by them but honestly I don't care. He was Gendo Ikari's right hand man. He knew what Gendo was planning, he knew the truth about the Eva's, about Second Impact, about Third Impact, about everything. While we were out there risking our lives he stood there knowing exactly what our battles were leading to.  
我不确定他是否被我的话吓了一跳，甚至可能有点被冒犯，但说实话我不在乎。他是碇源堂的得力助手。他知道碇源堂的计划，他知道关于 EVA、第二次冲击、第三次冲击以及所有事情的真相。当我们冒着生命危险时，他站在那里，清楚地知道我们的战斗将导致什么。

Finally after some time he speaks,  
终于，过了一会儿他开口了，

"Paradise... the world I had dreamed for... was not the reality I desired. No matter what I did there I knew it was false. I knew it was empty so I made the decision to return. I wondered at first if maybe I was the only one but... then I saw your message on the beach."  
“天堂……我曾梦想的世界……并不是我所渴望的现实。无论我在那里做什么，我知道它是虚假的。我知道它是空洞的，所以我决定回来。起初我想，也许只有我一个人，但……后来我在海滩上看到了你的信息。”

"Well welcome to the apocalypse, population three right now. Unless of course you don't plan on staying."  
"好吧，欢迎来到末世，目前人口三个。当然，除非你不打算留下来。"

He ignores my sarcasm which annoys me somewhat, I'm dying for a reaction from him. It's been a long time since I've had the opportunity to yell at someone. I can already feel that part of me clawing to get to the surface.  
他无视了我的讽刺，这让我有点恼火，我渴望从他那里得到反应。我已经很久没有机会对某人大喊大叫了。我已经开始感觉到那部分自我在蠢蠢欲动。

"How long have you both been here for?"  
"你们俩在这里待了多久？"

"Six weeks, give or take..."  
"六个星期左右吧..."

"And you've been surviving on your own? How?"  
"你一直一个人生活？怎么做到的？"

He sounds surprised, there is even a hint of concern in his voice. I answer his question at plainly as I can.  
他的语气中带着惊讶，甚至有一丝关切。我尽可能平淡地回答了他的问题。

"Scavenging mostly, living off of instant food and whatever we were able to rescue. We managed to find a freezer that was still working in a store and had a lot of frozen meat and other goods in. We also found the shelter some miles out of town that was well stocked."  
"主要靠搜刮，吃速食食品和能抢救到的东西。我们在一家店里找到了还在工作的冰柜，里面有很多冷冻肉和其他商品。我们还找到了城外几英里处的一个避难所，那里储备充足。"

"What about medical supplies?"  
"那医疗用品呢？"

"We have them. The shelter has an infirmary too in case we need it."  
"我们有。避难所里还有个医务室，以备不时之需。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

He looks at me and an awkward silence develops between us. Being honest this is probably the most interaction I've had with the Sub-Commander, outside of a few interactions and being berated by him for my 'attitude' I've had no reason to speak to him. I guess I wasn't like Rei or Shinji, I had no personal connections to anyone at NERV. I was the good soldier who was supposed to follow orders. No one needed to interact with me outside of giving commands, no one there truly needed me. Except for Shinji. Well that's fine by me, I didn't need any of them either.  
他看着我，我们之间陷入了尴尬的沉默。说实话，这可能是我和副司令互动最多的一次，除了几次交流和因我的‘态度’被他训斥外，我没有理由和他交谈。我想我和绫波或真嗣不一样，我在 NERV 没有与任何人有私人联系。我是个好士兵，本应服从命令。除了下达命令，没人需要和我交流，那里没人真正需要我。除了真嗣。好吧，这对我来说没问题，我也不需要他们中的任何一个。

"You mentioned this shelter..."  
“你提到这个避难所……”

I nod, "A few miles out of town, me and Shinji had to teach ourselves how to drive to reach it. About a thousand luxury apartments or so. Stocked bars, amusements, comfortable. Typical sort of place for your lot."  
我点头道：“离镇几英里远，我和真嗣不得不自学开车才能到达那里。大约有一千套豪华公寓吧。备有酒吧，娱乐设施，舒适宜人。你们这类人典型的去处。”

I've struck a nerve as he immediately fires back, "What do you mean my lot?"  
我似乎触到了他的痛处，他立刻反驳道：“你说的‘你们这类人’是什么意思？”

I was waiting for this. Time to raise my voice a little bit, time to let out that anger. In a way it's perfect that it's this man who is here. After all he was the last one to give me orders. Ones that conveniently missed out a few details too.  
"我早料到会有这一刻。是时候提高点音量，释放那股怒气了。某种程度上，这人在这里正合适。毕竟，他是我最后一个下达命令的人。那些命令恰巧遗漏了一些细节。”

"You know exactly what I mean. Your sort of people, the ones who sit behind desks and dish out orders to people like me and Shinji. Ones who talk and talk but are too cowardly to do anything. Ones who leave people like me in the dark. While people like me die."  
"你完全明白我的意思。你们这种人，坐在办公桌后面对我和真嗣这样的人发号施令。只会空谈却胆小如鼠，不敢采取任何行动。你们把我们蒙在鼓里。而我们这样的人却在牺牲。"

He looks away as I continue, "Tell me, when exactly where you planning on telling me about the capabilities of the Eva Series? Or were you just focusing on what Gendo was doing in Terminal Dogma? Hoping his plans would go as expected so everything would be alright for you?"  
他避开我的目光，我继续说道：“告诉我，你们到底打算什么时候才告诉我 EVA 系列的真正能力？还是你们只关注碇司令在最终教条区做什么？希望他的计划能如预期进行，这样你们就一切安好了？”

"Asuka I- the command centre was in chaos at that moment, we had JSSDF troops-"  
"明日香，我——指挥中心当时一片混乱，我们有自卫队的人——"

"Don't fucking lie to me, the JSSDF had pulled out by that point. I saw to that when I destroyed half of their battalion. So when were you planning on telling me? Or was I just expendable to you all. I mean after all I wasn't Rei, I wasn't created to achieve your plan and I certainly wasn't Shinji. So to hell if I died, I'd have bought you enough time to do what you needed and that was it."  
"别他妈对我撒谎，JSSDF 那时候已经撤离了。我亲眼所见，当我摧毁了他们半个营的时候。那你打算什么时候告诉我？还是说，对你们所有人来说，我只是一个可有可无的棋子。毕竟，我不是绫波，不是为了实现你们的计划而创造的，我也当然不是真嗣。就算我死了，也不过是为你们争取了足够的时间去完成你们需要做的事，仅此而已。"

"You were..." "你曾是..."

He pauses searching for the right words as I stare straight ahead at him. I'm ready to hear it. Hear that I was expendable, that I wasn't needed after all. Ready to hear that despite all my training and dedication to Eva I was ultimately just a spare part. It could have been anyone. Asuka Langley Sohryu wasn't that important after all.  
他停顿了一下，寻找合适的词句，而我直视着他。我已经准备好听到了。准备好听到我是个可有可无的人，毕竟我并不被需要。准备好听到尽管我对 Eva 的训练和奉献，我最终只是个备件。任何人都可以替代。式波·明日香·兰格雷，终究没那么重要。

"…It's true, Gendo saw you as expendable. You were an asset to NERV but when you started to lose your ability he had no problem seeing to it that you were replaced. I agreed to the replacement. I did not like the way it happened, I thought more could have been done to help you but by that time the power I had was name only."  
……确实，源堂视你为可牺牲的棋子。你对 NERV 而言曾是宝贵的资产，但当你开始失去能力时，他毫不犹豫地安排了替代你的人选。我同意了替换的决定。我不喜欢这一过程的方式，我认为本可以采取更多措施来帮助你，但那时我所拥有的权力不过是虚名罢了。

"So you didn't even try?"  
“所以你甚至没有尝试过？”

He shakes his head, "No, I didn't even try. The path we were on… I believed mistakenly it was for the best. I believed that everything would work out in the end, that it'd bring an end to the pain we were all suffering. Yet I was wrong… there was nothing there except for emptiness."  
他摇了摇头，“不，我甚至没有尝试。我们走的那条路……我错误地相信那是最好的选择。我以为最终一切都会好转，能结束我们所有人所承受的痛苦。然而我错了……那里除了空虚一无所有。”

"Stings doesn't it?" "刺痛了吧？"

I know what he means but I feel no sympathy for him. I can't feel sympathy for him because unlike me and Shinji he knew what was going to happen. He was part of the group that forced us towards that path. I still wonder to this day if it could have been averted somehow. If Shinji hadn't been so broken, if I hadn't have ran out of power, if Misato had learned the truth sooner, if Kaji hadn't have died. Could it have been averted? Not like it matters now, you can't redo.  
我明白他的意思，但对他没有丝毫同情。我无法对他产生同情，因为与我跟真嗣不同，他知道将会发生什么。他是那个逼迫我们走上这条路的小组成员之一。直到今天，我仍在想是否有可能避免这一切。如果真嗣没有那么崩溃，如果我没有耗尽能量，如果美里能更早得知真相，如果加持没有死。这一切能被避免吗？但现在说这些都无关紧要了，你无法重来。

I have to wonder though in Fuyutsukis case. Why did he do what he did? I know why Gendo did what he did. I know why Ritsuko Akagi was on this path too but why Fuyutsuki? What did he stand to gain from it?  
不过，我确实对冬月感到好奇。他为什么要做那些事？我知道碇源堂为什么那么做，也知道赤木律子为何走上这条路，但冬月呢？他从这一切中能得到什么？

"It is… not pleasant." "这……并不愉快。"

A part of me wants to laugh at him but instead I lay out more details of our return. I really let him know what has happened here.  
我的一部分想嘲笑他，但我还是详细地讲述了我们回来的情况。我真的让他知道了这里发生的一切。

"You know when I returned Shinji had already been back for two days."  
"你知道我回来时，真嗣已经回来两天了。"

"He was the only one?"  
“他是唯一的一个？”

I nod, "Yeah for two days he was alone on that beach. Surviving off of scavenged food and water and sleeping under a thin blanket. He couldn't keep any food down until I returned, you know why that was?"  
我点头，“是的，整整两天他独自一人在那片海滩上，靠捡来的食物和水维生，睡在一条薄薄的毯子下。直到我回来之前，他都无法进食，你知道为什么吗？”

Fuyutsuki shakes his head so I continue, "It's because of the guilt he felt at all of this. He thinks everything bad that happened from his arrival in Tokyo-3 to this was his fault. Every single death, every injury, every person that hasn't returned he blames himself for that. What triggered it though was my death. The image of my Eva's corpse impaled by those lances. My screams as I died. He himself took all the blame for that, and it made him sick."  
冬月摇了摇头，于是我继续说道，“那是因为他感到的内疚。他认为从他抵达第三新东京市到现在发生的所有坏事都是他的错。每一次死亡，每一次受伤，每一个未归之人，他都自责不已。而真正触发这一切的，是我的死亡。我那被长矛贯穿的 EVA 残骸，我临死前的尖叫。他把这些全部归咎于自己，这让他身心俱疲。”

There is concern on Fuyutsuki's face, "Is he alright now?"  
冬月脸上露出担忧的神色，“他现在还好吗？”

"Of course he is because I'm looking after him. When I returned I looked after him, I made sure he was able to eat again. I made sure he wasn't sick and actually did the one thing none of you lot bothered to do, I cared for him."  
“当然，因为我一直在照顾他。我回来后，确保他能再次进食，确保他没有生病。我做了你们这些人都没有费心去做的一件事，我关心他。”

"It sounds like you've grown a lot in the time you've been here."  
“听起来你在这里的这段时间里成长了很多。”

I wonder if that's true. Have I really grown that much in the time I've been here? Look at what I'm doing right now. I'm taking all of my anger and directing it at an old man. I'm trying to pass all of the blame for this on him when I know for a fact I had just as much to do with it as the others. I go back to that question, could it have been averted. What if when Shinji sought me out during that process I had bothered to do something other than berate him? What if I had actually spoke to him, and him to me? Could we have changed it?  
"我怀疑这是否是真的。在我在这里的这段时间里，我真的成长了那么多吗？看看我现在在做什么。我把所有的愤怒都发泄在一个老人身上。我试图把这一切的责任都推给他，尽管我清楚地知道我和其他人一样有责任。我又回到了那个问题，这一切是否可以避免。如果真嗣在那次过程中找我时，我不仅仅是对他斥责，而是做了些什么呢？如果我真正地和他交谈，他也和我交流，我们是否能改变这一切？”

I can't help it but I always go back to that moment, that horrible climax where I took this broken boy called Shinji and proceeded to tear him into even smaller pieces. All I'm doing now is projecting my blame onto someone else. Trying to make myself feel better because I finally have a living person to blame.  
我无法控制自己，总是回想起那一刻，那个可怕的高潮，我带着这个名叫真嗣的破碎男孩，继续将他撕成更小的碎片。我现在所做的，不过是将我的责备投射到别人身上。试图让自己感觉好些，因为我终于有了一个活生生的人来责怪。

No, that can't be true. This man, Fuyutsuki does deserve our scorn he does deserve to take the blame but he wasn't acting alone.  
不，那不可能。这个男人，冬月确实该受到我们的鄙视，他确实该承担责任，但他并非独自行动。

"Pilot Sohryu… Asuka… if I may…"  
"飞行员惣流…明日香…如果可以的话…"

"Go ahead." "请说吧。"

"I understand the scorn you have for me right at this moment in time. I can explain why I took part in it and the reasoning behind it if you would like me to but I'd also like to address Shinji in that too. He deserves to know why I did what I did, he deserves to know of the history behind me and his father and also his mother."  
"我理解你现在对我的鄙视。我可以解释我参与其中的原因和背后的逻辑，如果你愿意听的话。同时，我也想向真嗣说明。他有权知道我为什么这么做，他有权了解我和他父亲以及他母亲之间的历史。"

I'm wary of allowing him near Shinji but at the same time I can't have the truth hidden from him. Shinji does have a right to know.  
我对他接近真嗣心存戒备，但同时我也不能让真相对他隐瞒。真嗣确实有权知道。

"My actions cannot be justified, I know that but I also want you to understand that I want to help you and Shinji now. Before I left that place… I made a promise to someone. I wish to fulfil that promise."  
“我的行为无法被原谅，我知道这一点，但我也希望你能理解，我现在想帮助你和真嗣。在我离开那个地方之前……我对某人许下了一个承诺。我希望能够履行那个承诺。”

I listen to his words and realize the irony of the situation. Six or seven weeks ago I was an expendable soldier to this man. I barely knew him, had barely spoke to him and all I was to him was a bratty pilot who was fucking up constantly. Now here he is coming to me, begging for me to let him help.  
我听着他的话，意识到这情况的讽刺之处。六七周前，我对他来说只是一个可有可无的士兵。我几乎不认识他，几乎没和他说过话，对他来说我只是个不断搞砸的任性驾驶员。现在他却来到我面前，恳求我让他帮忙。

I also realize the truth that as much as I hate to admit it we will need help if we are to continue surviving. We can learn many things but there is a limit.  
我也意识到一个事实，尽管我不愿承认，但如果我们想要继续生存下去，我们将需要帮助。我们可以学习很多东西，但总有极限。

"Fine… but I won't let you hurt him."  
“好吧……但我不会让你伤害他。”

"I don't intend on doing so."  
“我并没有这个打算。”

I turn to leave and get Shinji but Fuyutsuki speaks again.  
我转身准备离开去找真嗣，但副司令再次开口。

"By the way, I know what it feels like… to be considered expendable."  
“顺便说一句，我知道那种感觉……被视为可牺牲的。”

"You were the Sub-Commander of NERV, Gendo's right hand man how can you possibly…"  
“您曾是 NERV 的副司令，碇司令的得力助手，您怎么可能……”

"I was Sub-Commander in name only, all that meant is I did the paperwork. If it wasn't for my insurance policy I would have been killed and replaced in a heartbeat."  
“我名为副指挥官，实则只是处理文书工作。若非我的保险策略，我早已命丧黄泉，被他人取而代之。”

I tilt my head at him in curiosity, "Insurance policy?"  
我好奇地歪头看向他，“保险策略？”

He nods, "The names and locations of the SEELE Committee who orchestrated Second Impact. The truth behind it all. If anything had happened to me that knowledge would have leaked out instantly and their plans halted and crumbled down around them. That was the only reason I was kept around, that and a promise I made to Yui Ikari."  
他点头道，“即 SEELE 委员会成员的姓名与藏身之地，他们策划第二次冲击的真相。一旦我有不测，这些信息便会立即泄露，他们的计划将随之瓦解。我之所以能存活至今，全赖于此，以及我对碇唯的承诺。”

"Shinji's mother?" "真嗣的母亲？"

Now I'm even more curious. I was unaware of the connection between Fuyutsuki and Shinji's mother. I immediately want to know more.  
现在我更加好奇了。我之前并不知道副校长和真嗣母亲之间的联系。我立刻想要了解更多。

"Yes… Yui was a former student of mine back before Second Impact but this is a story for Shinji to hear as well. If you would allow me the opportunity."  
"是的……在第二次冲击之前，Yui 曾是我的学生，但这个故事也应当由真嗣来听。如果您允许我讲述这个机会。"

I nod my head, "As long as you don't…"  
我点点头，“只要你别……”

"Hurt Shinji? I've no intention of it, I'm not his father."  
“伤害真嗣？我没有这个打算，我又不是他父亲。”

**I do remember one thing…  
我确实记得一件事……**

They've been down there for quite some time now. I'm sure I heard Asuka raise her voice at one point but I couldn't hear what she had said. She is angry, I know why she is angry but I can't bring myself to be. I'm just happy that someone has returned, even if it was the NERV Sub-Commander. It means that she was right, people can and will return. It just takes time. It means there is hope that Misato will come back, and the others. It means that she might have been right about the rest of the world.  
他们已经在下面待了相当长的时间。我确信我听到过明日香提高嗓门，但我听不清她说了什么。她很生气，我知道她为什么生气，但我无法让自己也生气。我只是很高兴有人回来了，即使那是 NERV 副司令。这意味着她是对的，人们可以而且会回来。只是需要时间。这意味着有希望米萨托会回来，还有其他人。这意味着她可能对世界的其他部分也是对的。

I know Asuka won't see it like that. I remember the way she looked at that back row of markers when I took her to that site. The hatred on her face, I expected her to kick each of them down just like she did the one that was supposed to be for her. I wouldn't have blamed her if she did, I wouldn't have been upset with her if she did. How could I be? After what those people did to us, to her especially she has earned the right to be angry. I am happy she didn't though.  
我知道明日香不会这么看。我记得带她去那个地方时，她看着后排那些标记的表情。她脸上的恨意，我以为她会像踢倒本该属于她的那个标记一样，把它们一个个都踢倒。如果她真的那么做了，我不会怪她，也不会因此对她生气。我怎么能呢？那些人对我们，尤其是对她所做的一切之后，她有权利感到愤怒。不过我很高兴她没有这么做。

I'm waiting for them to call me down, to see where this goes next. Part of me wants to go down there now and see what is happening but it's probably for the best I don't. Instead I'm re-arranging our CD collection that seems to have amassed over the last month. We took a chance and drove into a nearby town when hunting for supplies. It was slightly bigger than this, also abandoned but they had a music shop. Asuka decided it'd be a good idea to raid the prog section. I didn't even bother to protest this time besides she said it wasn't as if people were buying that stuff anymore anyway. Something about the general public being too stupid to appreciate that kind of music.  
我在等他们叫我下去，看看接下来会发生什么。一部分的我想要现在就下楼去看看情况，但或许不去才是最好的选择。相反，我正在重新整理我们的 CD 收藏，这些似乎在过去一个月里积累了不少。我们冒险开车去了附近的一个城镇寻找物资。那个镇子比这里稍大一些，同样被遗弃了，但他们有一家音乐店。明日香认为洗劫前卫摇滚区是个好主意。这次我甚至懒得抗议，何况她说反正现在也没人买那些东西了。她觉得大众太愚蠢，无法欣赏那种音乐。

I on the other hand probably managed to eclipse what that stuff would have cost with one item. A brand new cello for myself. Asuka was surprised to see me get it. Not because it went against my usual reluctance to 'borrow' items, but because I had told her I only played it because I was told to. I guess that was true. I did start because the teacher I lived in thought it'd be a good idea for me to play an instrument but I did enjoy it. I picked it up quickly, if there is something I was good at it was understanding how to play and read music. I just always downplayed that part of me. I don't know why, I'm a contradiction. I wanted praise off of people but when I did something worthy of praise I'd downplay it and say I wasn't very good.  
另一方面，我可能仅凭一件物品就超过了那些东西原本的花费。我给自己买了一把全新的大提琴。明日香看到我买它时感到惊讶。不是因为我违背了平时不愿“借用”物品的习惯，而是因为我曾告诉她，我拉大提琴只是因为被要求这么做。我想那确实是真的。我开始学习是因为我寄宿的老师认为我学一门乐器是个好主意，而我确实也乐在其中。我学得很快，如果说有什么是我擅长的，那就是理解和演奏音乐。我只是总是低估了这一部分的我。我不知道为什么，我是个矛盾体。我渴望得到别人的赞扬，但当我做了值得赞扬的事情时，我却会贬低它，说自己其实不怎么样。

So I've been trying to practice a little bit each day again. I got a few music books to remind myself of a few pieces and I've even been trying to compose my own material. So far I've got an audience of one. Asuka watches me intently every time I practice. She'll sit near to me, she'll listen quietly to everything I play. Every warm-up exercise I do, every mistake I make, every piece I try and every scale I improvise on. She won't speak while I practice, she'll just sit there watching me and smiling. So I've been trying to play some of the music she puts on in the car, and that she listens to. Every now and then I'll sneak it into my practicing and I'll see her eyes light up as if I've done something wonderful.  
所以我又开始每天练习一小会儿了。我买了几本乐谱，提醒自己一些曲子，甚至尝试创作自己的作品。到目前为止，我有一个观众。每次我练习时，明日香都会专注地看着我。她会坐在我旁边，静静地听我弹奏的一切。我做的每一个热身练习，我犯的每一个错误，我尝试的每一首曲子，我即兴演奏的每一个音阶。她在我练习时不会说话，只是坐在那里看着我，微笑着。所以我试着弹奏她在车上放的那些音乐，以及她听的那些。偶尔我会偷偷将其融入我的练习中，看到她的眼睛亮起来，仿佛我做了什么美妙的事情。

Some of Asuka's music is a bit strange and the songs can be really long too. Sometimes we'll drive to the shelter and by the time we get there the first song is only just finishing but I don't mind. The songs are in English too so I don't really understand them. I can speak some English but not enough to really understand the songs. Asuka is helping me out though, translating the lyrics for me to understand them. It sometimes helps, although other times it just confuses me more.  
明日香的一些音乐有点奇怪，而且歌曲也很长。有时候我们会开车去避难所，等到了那里，第一首歌才刚刚结束，但我并不介意。这些歌是用英语唱的，所以我并不真正理解。我会说一些英语，但不足以理解这些歌曲。不过明日香正在帮我，她把歌词翻译给我听，让我理解。有时候这会有帮助，但其他时候反而让我更困惑了。

I don't really have much of a music collection yet. I always liked music but for me I hung onto the same songs on my SDATs tape. I guess it's time I explored more. I put back the copy of King Crimson's Discipline into its correct place amongst the other albums. Just in time for the door to open and for both Asuka and Fuyutsuki to walk through. Almost immediately I jump to my feet.  
我的音乐收藏其实并不多。我一直喜欢音乐，但对我来说，我总是坚持听 SDAT 磁带上的那些老歌。我想现在是时候探索更多了。我把 King Crimson 的《Discipline》放回其他专辑中的正确位置。正好门开了，Asuka 和 Fuyutsuki 走了进来。我几乎立刻就站了起来。

"Sub… Sub-Commander…" 副…副指挥官…

He waves his hand at me, "Please, just Kozo is fine. As me and Asuka have already established we're all equal now. NERV is no longer and along with it no more ranks."  
他向我挥了挥手，“请，叫我高雄就好。我和明日香已经达成共识，我们现在都是平等的。NERV 已经不复存在，随之而来的等级制度也不再有。”

I bow my head, "Is there… anything we can get you… we have tea and-"  
我低下头，“请问…有什么我们可以为您准备的…我们有茶和-”

Fuyutsuki looks across to Asuka who nods, "Just tea, thank you."  
冬月环顾四周，看到明日香点了点头，“只要茶，谢谢。”

I nod and immediately go into the kitchen to make some tea for us all. A few minutes later I'm back in the front room and put the cups down on the table for us all. He thanks me once again as we all take a seat. Asuka is the first to speak. Her voice is cold, emotionless and commanding. It isn't the same voice she uses with me, it lacks any of the kindness she shows me now.  
我点头后立刻走进厨房为我们大家泡茶。几分钟后，我回到客厅，将茶杯放在桌上。他再次向我道谢，我们各自落座。明日香率先开口，她的声音冷酷、毫无情感且充满命令感。这与她对我说话时的语气截然不同，少了那份她现在展现给我的温柔。

"You mentioned a story for us, I think we should hear it now don't you think?"  
“你提到要给我们讲个故事，现在是不是该讲了？”

Fuyutsuki nods, "Yes of course. It'll try to not leave anything out."  
冬月点头道：“当然，我会尽量不遗漏任何细节。”

He turns to me, "Shinji, how much do you know of my relationship with your parents?"  
他转向我，问道：“真嗣，你对我和你父母的关系了解多少？”

I recall what I do know, "Nothing only that you were there the day my mother died."  
我回想起我所知道的，答道：“一无所知，只知道我母亲去世那天你在场。”

"Yes I was… it was a sad day for us all. I've actually known your mother for longer than that. I was her teacher when she was at University. That is also when I met your father who was then going by the name Gendo Rokubungi."  
“是的，我在……那对我们所有人来说都是悲伤的一天。其实我认识你母亲更早。她上大学时，我是她的老师。也是在那时，我遇到了你父亲，当时他用的名字是碇ロクブンギ。”

A part of me feelings like I already know this but I can't think of why I might know that. I feel like I should interject but I stay quiet and let him speak.  
一部分的我感觉好像已经知道这些，但又想不起来为什么我会知道。我觉得应该插话，但还是保持沉默，让他继续说下去。

"Your father was… something of a troubled individual at University. He was constantly getting into fights, I don't know what sort of upbringing he had. I never wanted to know so I never asked. At first I knew of him by reputation but the first time I met him properly was when he got the police to call me."  
“你父亲在大学时……可以说是有些麻烦的人。他经常打架，我不知道他受过什么样的教育。我从不想了解，所以从未问过。起初我是通过传闻知道他的，但第一次正式见面是他让警察打电话给我。”

"The police?" “警察？”

"Yes, he had been arrested after a bar-fight and for some reason he put my name down as a point of contact. From there I developed something of a working relationship with the man. He was troubled yet he had some interesting ideas and I guess I made it a project of trying to change and shape that."  
是的，他在一次酒吧斗殴后被捕，出于某种原因，他留下了我的名字作为联系人。从那以后，我和他建立了一种工作关系。他虽有困扰，却有着一些有趣的想法，我想我把它当作了一个改变和塑造他的项目。

Asuka cuts in, "Hold on you mean Shinji's father used to get into drunken bar-fights?"  
明日香插话道，“等等，你是说真嗣的父亲以前会喝醉后在酒吧打架？”

She can't hide the amusement in her voice and I'm fairly sure I can't hide the embarrassment on my face. I didn't need to learn that.  
她声音中的笑意藏不住，而我脸上的尴尬也几乎无法掩饰。我真不需要知道这些。

"Yes, quite a lot actually. Around this time I had a star pupil. Your mother Yui Ikari. She confided in me one day that she was dating Gendo Rokubungi. I naturally questioned it, maybe even tried to discourage it but she was stubborn. She claimed she could see something in him that others couldn't, a kindness… I tried to see it but all I saw was an arrogant man who was wasting his youth. Still I wished them well and hoped that maybe Yui could change him. After they both graduated that was the last I would see of them until after Second Impact."  
"是的，确实很多。大约在这个时候，我有一位非常出色的学生。你的母亲，碇唯。有一天，她向我坦白她正在和六分仪源堂交往。我自然对此表示怀疑，甚至可能试图劝阻她，但她很固执。她声称她能看到别人看不到的他身上的某种善良……我试图去发现，但我看到的只是一个浪费青春的自大男人。尽管如此，我还是祝福他们，并希望唯或许能改变他。在他们毕业后，我就再也没有见过他们，直到第二次冲击之后。"

I want to ask more about my mother and father at that time but I decide that can wait until later. For now I listen to what he has to say.  
我想多问一些关于我父母当时的事情，但我决定可以稍后再问。现在，我倾听他要说的话。

"After Second Impact I ceased to be a university professor, the world at that time was in disarray and I felt my skills could be put to better use. University professors were not exactly needed at that time so I set up an 'unlicensed' clinic for the community near Toyohashi. Not strictly legal but back then that didn't matter, the world needed doctors, those people needed doctors and a man of my reputation could get away with it."  
"第二次冲击后，我不再是大学教授，那时世界一片混乱，我觉得我的技能可以得到更好的利用。那时并不真正需要大学教授，所以我就在丰桥附近为社区建立了一个‘未经许可’的诊所。虽然不完全是合法的，但在当时那并不重要，世界需要医生，那些人需要医生，而我这样有声望的人可以蒙混过关。"

He sips from his tea before continuing, "It was around this time I was selected to be part of an investigatory expedition to the South Pole. The site of Second Impact. While there I made some discoveries linking your parents to the incident as well as a group known as SEELE. I gathered as much information as I could with the aim of making it public. I was going to blow the whistle on the whole thing, the fact that Second Impact had been orchestrated by humans. I eventually confronted your father, told him I knew everything and I knew that he and Yui were involved in some way."  
他啜了一口茶，继续说道：“大约在这个时候，我被选中参与一次南极的调查探险，那里是第二次冲击的现场。在那里，我发现了一些线索，将你的父母与该事件以及一个名为 SEELE 的组织联系起来。我尽可能多地收集信息，目的是将其公之于众。我打算揭露整个事件，即第二次冲击是由人类策划的。最终，我面对你的父亲，告诉他我知道一切，我知道他和 Yui 以某种方式参与其中。”

I can feel my stomach churning with his words. All I can do is stare at the floor as his words roll around inside my head. My parents had a hand in Second Impact, they were in some way responsible for it. I feel Asuka's hand slip over mine and hear her speak.  
他的话让我感到胃里一阵翻腾。我只能盯着地板，任由他的话在脑海中回荡。我的父母参与了第二次冲击，他们在某种程度上对此负有责任。我感觉到 Asuka 的手轻轻覆盖在我的手上，听到她说话。

"Continue…" “继续…”

Fuyutsuki questions her, "Is Shinji alright?"  
冬月向她询问，“真嗣还好吗？”

I finally look up and weakly smile, "I'll be alright… please, I need to hear more."  
我终于抬起头，虚弱地笑了笑，“我会没事的……请，我需要了解更多。”

"Very well… I confronted him but he didn't seem bothered. In fact it was as if he already knew this was going to happen. Of course he did know, he was the one who recommended I go on the expedition in the first place. He presented me with an opportunity, to join him and Yui in helping to create a new beginning for humanity. He explained to me what had happened during Second Impact and he shown me the first Evangelion Unit. Your mother helped persuade me as well so I joined GEHIRN, ensuring the information I had was kept safe in case anything should happen to me."  
“很好……我曾质问他，但他似乎并不在意。事实上，他好像早已预料到这一切会发生。当然，他确实知道，因为他是最初推荐我参加那次探险的人。他给了我一个机会，让我和他以及唯一起，为人类创造一个新的开始。他向我解释了第二次冲击期间发生的事情，并让我看到了第一台 EVA 初号机。你的母亲也帮助说服了我，所以我加入了 GEHIRN，确保我所掌握的信息在我遭遇不测时能得到保护。”

Again he takes a sip of tea, "I want you to understand one thing Shinji. Regardless of what you think of myself or your father. Your mother was not a bad person."  
他又啜了一口茶，“真嗣，我希望你明白一件事。无论你对我和你父亲有何看法，你的母亲绝不是一个坏人。”

"But… she was working for SEELE, she was working towards Third Impact?"  
“但是……她为 SEELE 工作，她在推动第三次冲击吗？”

"No, she wasn't. While SEELE believed humanity had run its course and that this was the best chance your mother believed differently. That is why she volunteered to be the control unit for Evangelion Unit 01. She knew what would happen, she knew what it would mean but it was the only way she could ensure a future for mankind. She made a mistake though…"  
“不，她没有。虽然 SEELE 认为人类已经走到了尽头，认为这是最好的机会，但你的母亲持不同观点。正因为如此，她自愿成为 EVA 初号机的控制单元。她知道会发生什么，她知道这意味着什么，但这是她确保人类未来的唯一方法。不过，她确实犯了一个错误……”

Asuka questions him, "And that was?"  
明日香质问他，“那是什么？”

"She confided her plans to me and not to Gendo, she made me promise to not say anything to him. I don't know why, maybe there was a part of her that didn't trust him completely, regardless she misjudged him and what has happened here is the result of that. Your father disappeared after that incident. When he returned he came to me with a new goal. Instead of giving control of Instrumentality to SEELE he would hijack it, he would re-unite with Yui."  
“她向我吐露了她的计划，而不是对源堂说，她让我发誓不向他透露任何信息。我不知道为什么，也许她内心深处并不完全信任他，尽管如此，她还是误判了他，这里发生的一切都是由此导致的。你的父亲在那次事件后消失了。当他回来时，他带着一个新的目标来找我。他不再将控制权交给 SEELE，而是要劫持它，他要与唯重聚。”

Asuka speaks again, all I can do is stare at the ground and listen. I want to get up and run into the room, I can feel my eyes stinging with tears threatening. I want to scream but I have to listen to this until the end. I knew my mother was in Unit 01, I knew she was there but I didn't know how far back this had gone. I didn't know all of this. "And you didn't think to stop him?"  
明日香再次开口，我只能盯着地面聆听。我想站起来冲进房间，我能感觉到眼睛因泪水而刺痛。我想尖叫，但我必须听到最后。我知道我母亲在初号机里，我知道她在那里，但我不知道这一切追溯到多远。我不知道这一切。“你当时就没想过阻止他吗？”

"I wanted to… but I couldn't. I had made a promise, all I could do was put my faith in Yui. I guess… I didn't trust Gendo either. I assumed she hadn't told him for a good reason so I didn't say anything either. I wonder if I had told him things might have turned out differently."  
"我本想……但我做不到。我曾许下承诺，唯一能做的就是相信唯。我想……我也不信任源堂。我猜她没告诉他是有充分理由的，所以我也没说什么。我在想，如果我告诉了他，事情会不会有所不同。"

I feel my hand tighten around Asuka's with his words. We've probably said those words to ourselves so many times since returning. If only we had done something else things might have turned out differently.  
听到他的话，我感到自己的手紧紧握住了明日香的手。自从回来后，我们可能已经无数次对自己说过这些话了。如果我们当时做了别的事情，结果会不会不同。

"It doesn't matter now, it's already happened. We have to look forward."  
"现在说这些都没意义了，事情已经发生。我们必须向前看。"

Fuyutsuki looks at me in surprise. I don't think he expected me to say something like that. I fight back more tears and squeeze Asuka's hand a bit more. I can feel her squirm slightly but I'll apologize later.  
冬月惊讶地看着我。我想他没料到我会说出这样的话。我强忍着不让更多的泪水流下，更加用力地握紧明日香的手。我能感觉到她微微扭动，但我会稍后道歉。

"My father was scared of being hurt and of hurting others… my mother was the only person who didn't hurt him and who he didn't hurt. He was scared of me, he was scared of you he was probably scared of the entire NERV staff so he did what he did in the hope that when he achieved it we'd all be happy…"  
“我父亲害怕受伤，也害怕伤害别人……我母亲是唯一一个没有伤害他，他也没有伤害的人。他害怕我，害怕你，可能还害怕整个 NERV 的员工，所以他做了那些事，希望当他达成目标时，我们都能快乐……”

"That's correct but…" “没错，但是……”

"I almost feel sorry for him but I can't…"  
“我几乎为他感到难过，但我不能……”

I release Asuka's hand finally and stand up as Fuyutsuki replies, "You shouldn't, but he did care for you in his own way. It doesn't justify it but he felt that the best thing for you would be for him to maintain distance. He felt that all he'd do is hurt you if he tried to do anything."  
我终于松开了明日香的手，站起来，听到冬月回答说：“你不应该，但他确实以自己的方式关心你。这并不能证明他的行为正确，但他觉得对你最好的就是保持距离。他认为如果他试图做任何事，只会伤害你。”

I nod slowly, "I know… but that's the thing… he didn't even try."  
我缓缓点头，“我知道……但问题就在这里……他甚至没有尝试。”

I look towards the bedroom door and decide it might be best to leave this conversation now. I've heard enough about my father, I've heard enough about my mother. Asuka can handle the rest. I've heard enough about anything.  
我望向卧室的门，决定现在最好结束这场对话。关于我父亲，关于我母亲，我已经听得够多了。剩下的，让明日香来处理吧。关于任何事情，我已经听得够多了。

"I'm… tired, you two can sort out the rest."  
“我……累了，你们俩可以解决剩下的问题。”

Asuka stands up as I head towards the door, "Shinji-"  
当我走向门口时，明日香站了起来，“真嗣——”

I don't respond, instead I stay focused on the door. My hand fumbles for the handle but I open it get inside and close it just in time for the tears to start flowing down my face. I immediately throw myself onto the bed and hope the pillow muffles the sounds of my sobs.  
我没有回应，只是紧紧盯着那扇门。我的手摸索着门把手，打开门，迅速进入并关上门，泪水恰好在这一刻开始滑落脸颊。我立刻扑倒在床上，希望枕头能掩盖住我的啜泣声。

Everything he has just said is running around in my head. My parents, their actions, what they did to the world, to Misato, Asuka, all my friends and what they did to me. Was this the world my mother envisions? Was this the product she was expecting when she put her faith in humanity? Is this what she was hoping for when she abandoned us without a word? Confiding in one man and not even letting him say a word about it?  
他刚刚说的一切在我脑海中盘旋。我的父母，他们的行为，他们对世界、对美里、对明日香、对所有朋友以及对我所做的一切。这就是我母亲所设想的世界吗？这就是她对人类抱有希望时所期待的结果吗？这就是她在无声无息地抛弃我们时所希望的吗？信任一个人，甚至不让他透露半点风声？

Is this what you wanted mother? A broken son? A world with no hope left, where we have to scavenge for food and hope that people might return. This is what your faith in humanity got you. I hope you're happy.  
母亲，这就是你想要的吗？一个破碎的儿子？一个毫无希望的世界，我们必须四处觅食，寄希望于人们的回归。这就是你对人类的信仰所换来的。我希望你能感到满意。

I don't know how long I've been in there but after a time the door opens and I hear Asuka come into the room. I've ran out of tears to cry at this point. Instead I'm just staring straight ahead at the wall whilst lying face down. She sits down on the bed and runs her hand along my back before gently leaning over and resting her head on my shoulder.  
我不知道自己在里面待了多久，但过了一段时间，门开了，我听到明日香走进房间。此时我已经流不出眼泪了。我只是脸朝下躺着，直勾勾地盯着墙壁。她坐在床上，用手抚摸着我的背，然后轻轻俯身，将头靠在我的肩上。

"I'll handle dinner tonight Shinji…"  
“今晚的晚餐我来处理，真嗣……”

With this she kisses me on the cheek softly. I thought I had no more tears left to cry, I was wrong.  
说着，她在我脸颊上轻轻一吻。我以为自己已经没有眼泪可流了，我错了。

### Chapter 7
**Author's Notes: 作者笔记：**

Hi everyone, just wanted to quickly say thanks to everyone following the story so far and leaving comments/reviews as it has gone on. I've been trying to do things a bit different with this, using the first person perspective and trying to use a bit of a darker tone in there. It's nice to see people leaving feedback, it's something I've always liked ever since I wrote my first major fic Conspiracy many years ago and it's nice to see now. So thank you.  
大家好，只是想快速地向所有一直关注故事并留下评论/评价的人表示感谢。我一直试图在这部作品中做一些不同的尝试，采用第一人称视角，并尝试在其中融入一些较为阴暗的基调。看到人们留下反馈真是太好了，自从多年前我写了我的第一部重要同人作品《阴谋》以来，我就一直喜欢这样，现在看到依然很开心。所以，谢谢你们。

---

I close the door after checking in on him another time. He's asleep now and looks so peaceful. He's barely said a word since our conversation with Fuyutsuki earlier. I don't blame him, it was a lot to take in for us both. Only I don't have the same emotional attachment he does. It wasn't my parents he was talking about. I didn't discover that my parents had helped stage one of the greatest disasters to hit mankind, I didn't discover my mother had let herself die in some Machiavellian plot that involved both husband and son to hopefully save the world.  
我再次检查完他后关上了门。他现在睡着了，看起来如此平静。自从我们早些时候与冬月谈话以来，他几乎没说过一句话。我不怪他，这对我们俩来说都很难接受。只是我没有他那样的情感牵绊。他谈论的不是我的父母。我没有发现我的父母参与策划了人类历史上最严重的灾难之一，我没有发现我的母亲为了一个涉及丈夫和儿子的马基雅维利式的阴谋而牺牲自己，希望能拯救世界。

I'm tempted to ask what he knows of my parents. My mother, I know so little about her in honestly. I have snippets of good times. Her playing music for me, holding me, playing with me but it's hazy. Instead all I really have of her is the image of her lying in a hospital bed, barely human and repeating words to me that no child should hear their mother say.  
我忍不住想问他对我父母了解多少。关于我母亲，老实说我几乎一无所知。我只有一些美好时光的片段。她为我弹奏音乐，抱着我，和我玩耍，但这些记忆都很模糊。相反，我真正拥有的关于她的画面是她躺在医院病床上，几乎不成人形，反复对我说着那些孩子不该从母亲口中听到的话。

I was raised by my father and my stepmother. Mostly my stepmother, my father gave up on me after I told him how much I hated him. I hated my stepmother as well. I hated them all and I still do. How dare she come into my life and try to control me and how dare he remarry someone so soon after my mother died.  
我是由父亲和继母抚养长大的。主要是继母，自从我告诉他我有多恨他之后，父亲就放弃了我。我也恨我的继母。我恨他们所有人，至今依然如此。她怎么敢闯入我的生活并试图控制我，而他怎么敢在母亲去世后这么快就再婚。

So maybe its best I don't ask about my parents. I'm fucked up enough without learning more. Still I'd like to know more about her sometime. For now though, my focus is on Shinji.  
所以也许最好还是别问关于我父母的事。即使不了解更多，我也已经够混乱了。尽管如此，我还是希望有一天能了解更多关于她的事情。但现在，我的重点是真嗣。

I feel a little bit guilty that I'm not there trying to make him feel better now but I need to discuss things with the former sub-commander. Like what the next move should be. As much as I dislike the man I've been hoping someone like him would return. In honesty I was hoping for Misato but this will do.  
我感到有些内疚，因为我现在不在那里试图让他感觉好些，但我需要与前副指挥官讨论一些事情。比如下一步该怎么做。尽管我不喜欢这个人，但我一直希望像他这样的人能回来。老实说，我曾希望是美里，但这也行。

When I return to the front room, I see Fuyutsuki is sitting there looking at the television and mine and Shinji's collection of movies.  
当我回到前厅时，我看到副校长冬月正坐在那里看着电视，以及我和真嗣的电影收藏。

"See anything you like there? We tend to watch the documentaries. There is a good one there about penguins which was the first one we watched together. Another good one about the sea life after Second Impact. Did you know that after Second Impact sea life actually thrived? While the rest of the world saw its populations halved and even go extinct it was the sea life that managed to thrive. I wonder how it's going to react now…"  
“看到什么你喜欢的吗？我们通常看纪录片。有一部关于企鹅的很好，那是我们第一次一起看的。还有一部关于第二次冲击后海洋生物的也不错。你知道吗，第二次冲击后，海洋生物实际上蓬勃发展了？当世界其他地方的人口减半甚至灭绝时，海洋生物却能茁壮成长。我在想现在它们会如何反应……”

Fuyutsuki nods, "I did know that but… thank you. How is Shinji?"  
冬月点头，“我确实知道，但……谢谢你。真嗣怎么样了？”

"He's sleeping, looks quite peaceful actually."  
“他正在睡觉，看起来相当平静。”

"I'm sorry for upsetting him… I know you wanted to avoid that…"  
“我很抱歉让他难过……我知道你本想避免这种情况……”

I throw myself down onto the sofa and sit back, "He… wanted you to tell him. It was his choice, and I suppose he had to know."  
我把自己扔到沙发上，向后一靠，‘他……希望你告诉他。那是他的选择，我想他必须知道。’

"You care about him a lot don't you?"  
‘你很在乎他，对吧？’

I look up at him. Once upon a time I might have denied that. The idea of me liking Shinji Ikari was ridiculous, something to laugh at and deride the person who suggested it. Now I don't care who knows it. I'm not ashamed of it, "Yeah… I do."  
我抬头看着他。曾经我可能会否认这一点。我居然喜欢真嗣，这想法荒谬可笑，足以让人嘲笑并奚落提出这观点的人。但现在我不在乎谁知道。我不为此感到羞耻，‘是的……我确实在乎。’

"And he cares about you?"  
"他关心你吗？"

I nod, "Yes. Just a shame it took an apocalypse for us to realize it really…"  
我点点头，"是的。只是可惜，我们得等到世界末日才真正意识到这一点……"

I sigh as Fuyutsuki changes the topic. "Would it be possible for you to take me to this other shelter tomorrow? I'd like to see it."  
我叹了口气，因为冬月改变了话题。"明天你能带我去另一个避难所吗？我想看看。"

I smile, "Thinking of upgrading to something more befitting of a man like yourself? Don't fancy living in the ruins with us?"  
我微笑道，“在考虑升级到更适合您这样人物的住所吗？不喜欢和我们一起住在废墟里？”

"I think you have the wrong idea of me. The idea of living somewhere like that in this environment is abhorrent to me."  
“我想你对我有些误解。在这种环境下住在那样的地方，我实在无法接受。”

"I thought it'd have been right up your street."  
“我以为那正合你意呢。”

"Hardly, I was probably happiest working in Toyohashi in that cramped clinic that doubled as my home."  
“一点也不，我在丰桥那个既是家又是诊所的狭小地方工作时，可能是最快乐的。”

"So why bother to visit it?"  
“那为什么还要费心去参观呢？”

"Because I have to think logically, and right now I think the best place for the three of us would be in that shelter. It has medical supplies, food and power which is everything we need to survive."  
“因为我得逻辑思考，现在我认为我们三个最好的去处就是那个避难所。那里有医疗用品、食物和电力，这些都是我们生存所需的一切。”

I immediately leap onto the defensive. We don't need him to look out for us, we don't need anyone, "We can survive fine here. We have a generator, we have food and medical supplies. Everything we need. No when others come back they can go there but we stay."  
我立刻采取了防御姿态。我们不需要他来照顾我们，我们不需要任何人，“我们在这里可以很好地生存。我们有发电机，有食物和医疗用品。我们所需的一切都有。等其他人回来时，他们可以去那里，但我们留下。”

"With all due respect Asuka, what you and Shinji have here hardly counts as medical supplies. A first aid box barely covers it. I have no doubt about your abilities to survive, you've both done an incredible job but despite that I have concerns."  
“恕我直言，明日香，你和真嗣这里的东西几乎算不上医疗用品。一个急救箱勉强凑合。我毫不怀疑你们生存的能力，你们俩已经做得非常出色了，但尽管如此，我还是有些担忧。”

I laugh, "Concerns about what?"  
我笑了，“担忧什么？”

"If other people come back, what will happen if they come across this place and encounter two teenagers staying here. Much less the pilots of the Evangelion Units. We don't know how they'll react, we don't know what their state will be. The next person to return could be anyone or a number of people and this place isn't safe for you both."  
"如果其他人回来了，他们要是经过这个地方，遇到两个留在这里的青少年，会发生什么呢？更别提那些 EVA 机体的驾驶员了。我们不知道他们会作何反应，也不知道他们的状态如何。下一个回来的人可能是任何人，甚至是一群人，这个地方对你们俩来说并不安全。"

The thing I hate is that I know he is right. It's something I've thought about myself for a couple of weeks now. As much as I dislike the idea of moving into that shelter of luxury it probably is the best idea in the long term. He continues to speak.  
我讨厌的是，我知道他说得对。这一点我自己也已经考虑了几周了。尽管我不喜欢搬进那个豪华避难所的想法，但从长远来看，这可能确实是最好的主意。他继续说着。

"Also I'm concerned about your medical conditions. You've been surviving on your own for six weeks in this environment. I'd like to examine you both, with your permission of course. My concerns are probably misplaced but we should be aware of what, if any, effects this environment might have on us."  
"另外，我对你们的健康状况感到担忧。你们已经在这个环境中独自生存了六个星期。如果你们允许的话，我想给你们俩做个检查。我的担忧可能有些多余，但我们应该意识到这个环境可能对我们产生的任何影响。"

I flinch involuntarily at the idea of him examining us both. I shudder inside at the idea of trusting this man after what he was a part of. Again I know he is probably right, we really don't know enough about this world as it is and considering what we both went through prior to Third Impact and during, especially me, it is probably for the best. So naturally I reject the idea.  
想到他要同时检查我们两人，我不由自主地退缩了。一想到要信任这个曾参与其中的男人，我内心就感到一阵颤栗。尽管我再次明白他可能是对的，我们对这个世界了解得实在太少，考虑到我们在第三次冲击前后的经历，尤其是我，这或许是最好的选择。但自然地，我拒绝了这一想法。

"No, we're both fine. It's been six weeks for us and neither of us are ill or anything. The only time any of us has been was Shinji during the first few days he was here... so no. We'll go to the Shelter like you ask and take a look around."  
“不，我们都没事。已经过去六周了，我们俩都没有生病或什么的。唯一一次有人生病是真嗣刚来这里的前几天……所以不，我们会按照你的要求去避难所看看。”

He nods and doesn't press the issue. That was easy, almost too easy. I expected some resistance from him. I expected him to insist on it but instead he just moves onto the next subject.  
他点点头，没有继续追问。这太容易了，几乎过于容易。我本以为他会反对，本以为他会坚持，但他却直接转到了下一个话题。

"I suppose we should look at the communications equipment as well. You and Shinji haven't used it yet have you?"  
"我想我们也应该检查一下通讯设备。你和真嗣还没用过它，对吧？"

I shake my head, "No we haven't. We were going to wait until other people had returned before trying it... it's..."  
我摇摇头，"不，我们还没用过。我们打算等其他人回来后再尝试... 它..."

I lower my voice a bit even though I know Shinji is asleep. I still don't want to risk him hearing this, I don't want to give him a reason to worry.  
我稍微压低了声音，尽管我知道真嗣在睡觉。我还是不想冒险让他听到这个，我不想给他任何担心的理由。

"It'd be dangerous to use it as we are..."  
"以我们现在的状态使用它会非常危险..."

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"As Asuka Langley Sohryu and Shinji Ikari... if we made contact with the outside world as those people we don't know what'd happen. The Japanese government ordered the JSSDF to assassinate us didn't they? That group, SEELE they were all powerful figures in the UN. If we make ourselves known to be alive and there is someone out there then they can easily finish the job can't they?"  
"作为惣流·明日香·兰格雷和碇真嗣...如果我们以那些身份与外界接触，我们不知道会发生什么。日本政府不是命令自卫队来暗杀我们了吗？那个组织，SEELE，他们在联合国中都是举足轻重的人物。如果我们暴露自己还活着，那么他们很容易就能完成任务，不是吗？"

Fuyutsuki looks at me for a moment contemplating his answer. Eventually he gives a reply.  
冬月看着我，沉思了一会儿他的回答。最终，他给出了答复。

"What you say makes sense I suppose. I suppose we don't know enough about who might have returned in other parts of the world to establish a plan yet. There might still be some action we can take though. Establishing contact under different names, sound only, that sort of thing. Until we figure out the state of the world, who is in charge. I do not think SEELE will be a factor against us but you are right to be concerned. I presume this is something Shinji can't know."  
"你说得有道理，我想。我们对于世界上其他地方可能回归的人了解还不够，因此还无法制定计划。不过，我们或许还能采取一些行动。用不同的名字建立联系，只用声音，诸如此类的事情。在我们弄清楚世界的状态、谁在掌控之前。我不认为 SEELE 会是我们对抗的因素，但你担心得对。我想这件事不能让真嗣知道。"

"Of course not... not yet anyway. Not until we figure it all out."  
"当然不能...至少现在还不行。在我们弄清楚一切之前。"

"I understand. In which case I shall take my leave of you both tonight. I spotted a cottage on the outskirts of the town I can take resident in. May I borrow your crowbar?"  
"我明白了。那么今晚我就此告辞。我在镇郊发现了一间小屋可以暂住。能借用一下你的撬棍吗？"

I smile and point to the corner of the room where it's resting against the wall, "Of course, go ahead."  
我微笑着指向房间的角落，那里靠着墙，“当然，请便。”

He picks the item up and starts to leave the room before stopping and turning back towards me, "If Shinji awakes tell him I said good bye, and once again Asuka, I apologize for everything that has happened."  
他拿起物品，正要离开房间，却又停下脚步转身面向我，“如果真嗣醒来，告诉他我道别了，还有，再次向明日香道歉，为发生的一切。”

He leaves the room and I'm hit immediately by the silence in here. I look towards mine and Shinjis bedroom door and think about him lying in there sleeping. I think about what he must have gone through tonight hearing those things about his parents. I think about what is to come. Someone has finally returned, it could mean that tomorrow we'll see more return. It could mean that I was right and around the world right now cities have been re-established and people are moving forward. Or it could mean that there are only three of us in the world right now.  
他离开了房间，我立刻被这里的寂静所包围。我望向我和真嗣的卧室门，想着他正躺在里面熟睡。我想象着他今晚听到关于父母那些事后所经历的痛苦。我想着即将到来的未来。终于有人回来了，这可能意味着明天会有更多人归来。也许这意味着我之前的猜测是对的，世界各地的城市已经重建，人们正在向前迈进。或者，这也可能意味着，现在世界上只有我们三个人。

It's so quiet in here right now. I wonder what this town would have been like before Third Impact. Would it have been a busy town at this time of the night? There are a few restaurants nearby so maybe it saw a fair share of tourists and was kept busy. Or perhaps it was quiet, and the restaurants were kept open by loyal locals who visited frequently.  
现在这里静悄悄的。我想知道在第三次冲击之前，这个小镇会是什么样子。在夜晚的这个时候，它会不会是一个繁忙的城镇？附近有几家餐馆，也许它接待了不少游客，一直很热闹。或者它本就宁静，餐馆之所以营业，是因为忠实的当地居民经常光顾。

I wonder who the occupants of this apartment would have eventually been. The town isn't too far out from Tokyo-3 with train and bus links. Could have been someone who worked at NERV or one of the places in the city. Maybe it was going to be a young couple, someone like me and Shinji who would come in after their day. Sit on the couch and hold each other and pretend to watch movies but instead just end up making out and touching each other up. Then they retire to the bedroom and give themselves to each other completely.  
我想知道这间公寓的住户最终会是谁。小镇离第三新东京市不远，有火车和公交线路连接。可能是 NERV 或城市里某个地方的员工。也许会是一对年轻夫妇，像我和真嗣那样，在一天结束后回到这里。坐在沙发上，互相依偎，假装看电影，结果却只是亲吻和抚摸对方。然后他们回到卧室，完全将自己交给对方。

I enter our bedroom and I look at Shinji lying in bed sleeping and wonder what he is dreaming of, if anything at all. He looks so calm and peaceful, I wonder what he looked like when he wasn't being so calm and peaceful in bed. I can already feel those thoughts sneaking into my head again. It always begins like this, I look at him when he's like this or when he's cooking us food and he's cute. His eyes are so deep, so expressive. I can tell his exact mood just be looking at them no matter what he says or the rest of his face. His eyes always give him away.  
我走进我们的卧室，看着躺在床上熟睡的 Shinji，不禁好奇他在梦些什么，如果有梦的话。他看起来如此平静祥和，我好奇他在床上不那么平静祥和时是什么样子。那些念头又开始悄悄潜入我的脑海。总是这样开始的，当我看到他这样子，或者他在为我们做饭时显得可爱。他的眼睛深邃而富有表现力。无论他说什么或他的脸的其他部分如何，我只需看他的眼睛就能准确判断他的情绪。他的眼睛总是泄露他的真实感受。

Then I stop imagining him being cute, I imagine him with other expressions. Expressions of pleasure as I have my way with him, as we give ourselves to each other. I wonder if he looks at me when I'm asleep and has similar thoughts. I wonder if he thinks I'm cute when I'm asleep. I wonder if he needs me in the same way I need him.  
然后我停止想象他可爱的样子，我开始想象他带着其他表情。当我随心所欲地与他亲热，当我们彼此奉献时，他脸上流露出的愉悦表情。我想知道当我睡着时，他是否也会这样看我，是否也会有类似的念头。我想知道他是否觉得我睡着时很可爱。我想知道他是否像我需要他一样需要我。

I remove my shirt and stand topless in the coolness of our room for a moment looking down at him. A part of me wants him to wake up and see me like this. See me stood naked and confident rather than the broken girl I was when I removed my bandages. He won't wake up though unless I wake him. So with that I put on a loose shirt and remove my jeans and settle into bed. I put my arm around him trying to not wake him and press myself into his back for warmth.  
我脱下衬衫，赤裸上身站在房间的凉爽中，低头看着他。我的一部分希望他能醒来，看到我这样。看到我赤裸而自信地站立，而不是那个摘下绷带时破碎的女孩。但他不会醒来，除非我叫醒他。于是我穿上一件宽松的衬衫，脱掉牛仔裤，钻进被窝。我伸出胳膊搂住他，尽量不吵醒他，紧紧贴着他的背取暖。

"Good night Shinji." "晚安，真嗣。"

**Does Earth put a hole in heaven?  
地球会在天堂上凿个洞吗？**

**_December 31_****_st_** **_2015_** 2015 年 12 月 31 日

I'm sat at the kitchen table in our apartment, I don't remember how I got here. I don't remember a lot nowadays, the days continue to roll by and I have the same routine every day now. I get up, I sit at this stupid table and I eat whatever stupid breakfast has been made for me. I hear them talk about whatever stupid subject they're talking about. Trying to make conversation in this cesspit of a world. I hear them try to engage me in their petty conversation. Talking about synchronisation scores or tests or whatever.  
我坐在我们公寓的厨房桌旁，不记得自己是怎么来到这里的。最近很多事情我都记不清了，日子一天天过去，我现在每天都是同样的例行公事。起床，坐在这张愚蠢的桌子前，吃着为我准备的任何愚蠢的早餐。我听到他们在谈论任何愚蠢的话题。试图在这个污秽的世界里制造对话。我听到他们试图让我参与他们琐碎的对话。谈论同步率分数或测试之类的东西。

I ignore it all, I listen to none of it because I don't care. They can all drop dead for I care, the lot of them. Shinji, Misato, Wondergirl, the entire human race. I don't give a shit about them anymore. Everything I ever had has been taken away from me, so why should I give a shit. I hate the lot of them.  
我无视这一切，我什么也不听，因为我不在乎。他们都可以去死，我不在乎，他们所有人。真嗣，美里，明日香，整个人类。我再也不在乎他们了。我曾拥有的一切都被夺走了，所以我为什么要关心。我恨他们所有人。

Today feels different somehow. Maybe it's because of the stabbing pain in my stomach. I must be due to start my period, I always get bad cramps when I start. This feels different though, it isn't central to one area. It's scattered around my stomach this time. I can feel a pain in my left eye as well and up my arm too. I must be coming down with something. At least I have an excuse to go back to bed then.  
今天感觉有些不同。或许是因为胃部那刺痛的感觉。我猜可能是月经要来了，每次开始前我都会痛得厉害。但这次感觉不一样，并不是集中在一个区域。这次疼痛散布在我的整个腹部。我左眼和手臂也感到疼痛。我一定是生病了。至少这样我就有理由回床上躺着了。

I sit on the chair and I can hear Shinji enter the room. He starts to talk to me and I try my best to block it out but his words infiltrate my mind. Something is wrong it doesn't feel like he is talking to me but talking inside me.  
我坐在椅子上，能听到真嗣走进房间。他开始和我说话，我尽力不去听，但他的话语还是渗透进我的脑海。有些不对劲，感觉他不是在对我说话，而是在我内心说话。

"Please Asuka, talk to me… I want to help you, and I want to be with you forever."  
“求你了，明日香，跟我谈谈吧……我想帮助你，想永远和你在一起。”

He's said words like this before but again this is different. The words echo within me, they bounce around and they compel me to reply. Before I know it I'm talking back to him.  
他以前也说过类似的话，但这次感觉不同。这些话语在我心中回响，四处弹跳，迫使我回应。不知不觉间，我已经开始回话了。

"Then don't do anything. Don't come near me. All you ever do is hurt me."  
“那就别做任何事。别靠近我。你只会伤害我。”

"Liar." "骗子。"

Again I try to block it out but I can't, his words… they're too strong. Something about this isn't right, this entire scene isn't right. I'm in so much pain right now and I don't know why. I don't remember it. There is an image, a hazy one in my head of something. A figure impaled with something. Is it… is it me?  
我再次试图屏蔽这些话，但做不到，他的话语……太强烈了。整个场景都不对劲，一切都显得不正常。我现在痛苦不堪，却不知为何。我不记得了。脑海中有一个模糊的影像，一个被什么东西刺穿的影子。是我吗？

Suddenly I'm on my feet and I'm facing him. I'm right up in his face. With every line I say I step towards him and watch as he backs away towards the counter.  
突然间，我站了起来，面对着他。我几乎贴到了他的脸上。每说一句话，我就向他逼近一步，看着他退向柜台。

"Anyone will do for you! You're afraid of Misato, you're afraid of the First Child. You're afraid of your mother and father! So now you come crawling to me."  
“对你来说谁都行！你害怕美里，害怕第一适格者。你害怕你的父母！所以现在你来求我。”

As I speak it the image becomes more vivid in my mind. The figure it's… it's my Unit 02. I remember something, I was fighting… I was fighting something and then I lost. I lost again and I died? No wait, I saw something. Shinji in Unit 01 rising up and his scream filling the air. Then I was here.  
随着我说话，脑海中的画面变得更加清晰。那个身影是……是我的零二号机。我想起了一些事，我在战斗……我在与什么战斗，然后我失败了。我又失败了，我死了吗？不，等等，我看到了什么。真嗣在零一号机中升起，他的尖叫声响彻云霄。然后我就在这里了。

He brought me here, he literally did come crawling to me the bastard. After he let me die like that he came crawling to me with claims of wanting to help me. I angrily shove Shinji and watch as he falls to the ground, he grabs at something to try to keep him up but ends up pulling that onto the floor. All I can do is fix my cold stare at him as he lands on his backside, a boiling hot jar of coffee landing next to him.  
他带我来到这里，那个混蛋真的爬着来找我。在他那样让我死去之后，他居然还爬着来找我，声称想帮我。我愤怒地推开真嗣，看着他跌倒在地，他试图抓住什么来支撑自己，却反而把那东西拉到了地板上。我只能冷冷地盯着他，看他一屁股坐在地上，一罐滚烫的咖啡罐落在他旁边。

"Help me… please… help me Asuka…"  
“帮帮我…求你了…帮帮我，明日香…”

I stand over him and look down at his worthless face. I see the tears forming in his eyes. He thinks he can help me now? He thinks I'll help him? No, not this time Shinji. I'm breaking you for good now.  
我站在他上方，俯视着他那无用的脸。我看到他眼眶中涌出的泪水。他以为现在能帮我？他以为我会帮他？不，这次不行，真嗣。这次我要彻底毁了你。

"Pathetic." “可悲。”

He slowly picks himself up off of the floor. He's looking down at the ground, his eyes not matching mine. His breathing is ragged now and I take a step back. In one swift motion he grabs a chair and screams out.  
他缓缓从地板上爬起，目光低垂，眼神未与我相接。他的呼吸变得急促，我后退一步。他迅速抓起一把椅子，尖叫起来。

"HELP ME!" “救救我！”

I don't move from where I am. I'm not scared of him hurting me physically, in fact I welcome it. It couldn't be worse than the pain I've felt recently. I welcome him killing me but if I go down I'm going to make sure he comes with me.  
我没有从原地移动。我不怕他对我造成身体上的伤害，事实上我甚至欢迎。这不可能比最近我感受到的痛苦更糟。我欢迎他杀了我，但如果我倒下，我会确保他也跟我一起。

He throws the chair to his side and it hits the wall with a crunch.  
他把椅子扔到一旁，椅子撞到墙上发出一声碎裂声。

"Don't ignore me!" “别无视我！”

He flips the kitchen table up onto its side, sending all the food and plates on it crashing to the floor with a sickening crash.  
他猛地将餐桌掀翻，桌上所有的食物和盘子随之哗啦一声摔碎在地，发出令人心悸的巨响。

"DON'T IGNORE ME! HELP ME!"  
"别无视我！救救我！"

He stops still, his body is shaking and his breathing is ragged. I take one step forward and as coldly as I can I whisper the word.  
他僵立不动，身体颤抖，呼吸急促。我向前迈了一步，尽可能冷酷地低声吐出那个词。

"No."

Within a moment he looks up and snarls and I feel his hands around my throat. I'm lifted up into the air but I offer no resistance. Go on Shinji, do it. Put an end to my miserable fucking existence. Put an end to all of our existences.  
转眼间，他抬头咆哮，我感觉他的双手掐住了我的脖子。我被举到空中，却没有反抗。来吧，真嗣，动手吧。结束我这悲惨的狗屎生活。结束我们所有人的存在。

**...Or heaven put a hole in Earth?  
……还是天堂在地球上凿了个洞？**

My vision slowly returns, great I'm still alive and all the pain from before has gone. I open my eyes fully and find myself sat on a folding chair with a giant spotlight on me. I shield my eyes and look around. I appear to be on a stage of some sort in an empty theatre.  
我的视线慢慢恢复，太好了，我还活着，之前的疼痛都消失了。我完全睁开眼睛，发现自己坐在一张折叠椅上，头顶上是一盏巨大的聚光灯。我遮住眼睛，环顾四周。我似乎是在一个空荡荡的剧院舞台上。

I can remember everything. The entire conversation with Shinji in the kitchen, me shoving him onto the floor, him yelling and throwing the furniture around. I remember my reluctance to help him and I remember his hands around my throat. I remember why I did it, he had abandoned me during my fight. He had not appeared to help me and I had been beaten again. So I asked him to end it for me. Is that what has happened now? Did I die?  
我记得一切。厨房里与真嗣的整段对话，我把他推倒在地，他大喊大叫并四处乱扔家具。我记得自己不愿帮助他，也记得他掐住我脖子的手。我记得为什么这么做，他在我战斗时抛弃了我。他没有出现来帮我，我又一次被打败了。所以我请求他结束这一切。现在，是我死了吗？

All of the emotion I had felt from that moment is gone. I feel nothing now but a strange emptiness. Maybe I did die.  
那一刻所有的情感都消失了。现在我只感到一种奇怪的空虚。也许我真的死了。

As I bring my head back round I immediately leap up as a figure appears before me. I dart behind the seat until I realize exactly who it is. I almost scold myself at being scared by the appearance of Rei Ayanami.  
当我回过神来，一个身影突然出现在我面前，我立刻跳起来躲到座位后面，直到认出那是谁。看到绫波零的出现，我几乎要责备自己居然被吓到了。

"W-Wondergirl?" "W-Wondergirl？""

I glance at her and realize she is completely naked, paler than usual and there is a faint white glow around her.  
我瞥了她一眼，意识到她完全赤裸，比平时更苍白，周围还有一层微弱的白光。

"F-First… Ayanami? W-What is this place?"  
"F-First… Ayanami？W-这是哪里？""

She fixes me with a curious stare and tilts her head, "This is the world you wished for. An extension of the world Ikari wished for. The world without barriers between people but ultimately the world without his presence. Where you can be happy."  
她用好奇的目光盯着我，歪着头说：“这是你希望的世界。也是碇真嗣所希望的世界的延伸。一个没有人与人之间隔阂的世界，但最终是一个没有他存在的世界。在那里，你可以幸福。”

"T-The world without…? Where I can be happy?"  
“没有他的世界…？在那里我可以幸福吗？”

She nods, "Yes… Ikari was given the choice and sought answers from the one he cared most about. Those answers lead for him to make this wish. He wished for a world where he could no longer cause you or anyone else any pain and where he could no longer experience any pain. The world without the A.T. Field between people anymore and where he was no longer present."  
她点头道：“是的…碇真嗣得到了选择的机会，并向他最关心的人寻求答案。那些答案引导他许下了这个愿望。他希望创造一个不再给你或任何人带来痛苦，也不再经历任何痛苦的世界。一个不再有人与人之间 A.T.力场的世界，一个他不再存在的世界。”

I don't really know what to say. This is the world Shinji wished for. It's empty, there is no one else here. How can he have wished for this? What is this supposed to mean?  
我真的不知道该说什么。这是真嗣所希望的世界。这里空无一人，没有其他人存在。他怎么会希望这样？这到底意味着什么？

"Shinji… is no longer present. You mean he's dead?"  
“真嗣…不再存在了。你的意思是，他死了？”

"No."

"Then what do you mean no longer present, if he isn't dead he must still be present."  
“那如果不是死了，你说的不再存在又是什么意思？如果他没死，那就一定还在某个地方。”

"He does not exist within the consciousness of humanity anymore. The Shinji Ikari that you knew has removed himself from that collective consciousness. The only Shinji Ikari to exist is the Shinji Ikari within Shinji Ikari's own mind. The one that lives within the minds of others no longer exists, do you understand now?"  
"他已经不存在于人类的意识之中了。你所认识的碇真嗣已经从那个集体意识中抽离了自己。唯一存在的碇真嗣是存在于碇真嗣自己心中的那个。活在他人心中的那个碇真嗣已不复存在，你现在明白了吗？"

I shake my head, I don't understand at all. If that's the case then why does he exist within my mind? Why can I think about him? Why am I having this conversation about him right now? This makes no sense.  
我摇摇头，我完全不明白。如果真是那样，那为什么他还存在于我的心中？为什么我能想到他？为什么我现在要和他进行这场对话？这毫无道理。

"But he does still exist?"  
"但他确实还存在，对吗？"

"He does, but not within the minds of others. To the ones known as Misato Katsuragi, Touji Suzahara, Gendo Ikari, Ritsuko Akagi, Kensuke Aida there is not and never has been a Shinji Ikari. This is the nature of their world now."  
"他确实存在，但并非在他人心中。对于被称为葛城美里、铃原冬二、碇源堂、赤木律子、相田剑介的人来说，不存在也从未有过一个碇真嗣。这就是他们现在世界的本质。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because he wished for it to be so."  
"因为他希望如此。"

"Yes… but why… why did he do that?"  
"是的……但为什么……他为什么要这么做？"

I hear a loud sound above me and see the light of a projector hitting the wall of the stage behind me. It displays an image. It's of Shinji and myself, I'm being held up by him with his hands around my throat. There is an echo around the theatre.  
我听到头顶传来一声巨响，看到一束投影仪的光线打在舞台后方的墙上。墙上显示出一幅图像。那是我和真嗣，我被他双手掐住喉咙举了起来。剧院里回荡着回声。

_"Put an end to all our existences."  
“结束我们所有人的存在。”_

My mouth goes dry as I hear my own words. I remember saying that, I remember it clearly but hearing it played back to me, it feels different. I asked for him to do that, I asked for all of our existences to come to an end. I… didn't mean it though… did I?  
听到自己的话，我的嘴巴变得干燥。我记得说过那句话，记得很清楚，但听到它被回放，感觉却不同了。我请求他那样做，我请求结束我们所有人的存在。我……虽然没那个意思……对吧？

"Did… Shinji end everyone's existence? Is that where I am now?"  
"难道…是真嗣终结了所有人的存在？我现在就在那里吗？"

_"Nobody wants me, so they can all just die."  
"没有人需要我，所以他们都可以去死。"_

That voice echoing around, it belongs to Shinji. He's calling for everyone to die, just as I asked him to. No… I didn't mean that, I was mad… I was angry… I was broken. Shinji, you don't mean it either... do you?  
那个回荡在四周的声音，属于真嗣。他在呼唤大家去死，正如我要求他的那样。不…我不是那个意思，我当时很生气…我很愤怒…我崩溃了。真嗣，你也不是真心的…对吧？

_"Nobody cares whether I live or die. Nothing will change... so they can all just die..."  
“没人关心我是生是死。一切都不会改变……所以他们都可以去死……”_

His voice echoes in the theatre again. His words are like a dagger through my heart, and somehow bringing much more pain than the lances from those bastards did. He can't really mean it, we do care. I care if he lives or dies. Misato cared, Rei cared and your friends cared.  
他的声音再次在剧场中回荡。他的话语如同利刃刺穿我的心，带来的痛苦远超过那些混蛋的长矛。他不可能真的这么想，我们确实在乎。我在乎他是生是死。美里在乎，绫波在乎，你的朋友们也在乎。

_"It would be better if I never existed. I should just die too."  
“如果我从未来过这个世界会更好。我也应该去死。”_

I sink down to my knees at the final line. It's starting to dawn on me, he did this because of what I said to him in that Kitchen.  
我在最后一行文字前跪下。渐渐地，我明白了，他这么做是因为我在厨房对他说的话。

Rei speaks again. 丽再次开口。

"Shinji decided that rather than live in a world where no one wants him he would rather not exist. He exists on his own now. In a place where no one can hurt him anymore and where he can no longer hurt anyone."  
“真嗣决定，与其活在一个无人需要他的世界，他宁愿选择不存在。现在，他独自存在于一个无人能再伤害他，他也无法再伤害任何人的地方。”

"This is because of me isn't it?"  
"这都是因为我，对吧？"

She tilts her head at me, "I am curious. Why do you feel this way?"  
她歪着头看着我，""我很好奇。你为什么会有这种感觉？""

I think about it and I don't have an answer, all I know is that moments prior to being here I had used up the last of my anger and hatred on Shinji and now I've learned that I'm in a world where he no longer exists.  
我想了想，却找不到答案，我只知道在来到这里之前，我已经把最后的愤怒和仇恨都发泄在了真嗣身上，而现在我得知自己身处一个他不再存在的世界。

I feel a burning behind my eyes and force back any tears, I'm not going to cry. Not here and not in front of Rei Ayanami. Instead I take deep breath and talk behind the chair, I lean forward and place both hands on it.  
我感到眼后一阵灼热，强忍住泪水，我不会在这里哭，也不会在绫波零面前哭。我深吸一口气，站在椅子后面说话，身体前倾，双手放在椅子上。

"I… don't know." “我……不知道。”

It's all I can say.  
我只能说这些了。

"You do not agree with his actions?"  
"你不同意他的行为吗？"

"No of course I don't agree with his fucking actions."  
"当然不，我不同意他那该死的行为。"

"Yet you are the one who told him to do this."  
"然而，正是你让他这么做的。"

"I…"

I hang my head in shame as her words bounce around. I told him to do this. I told him to do this. I told him to do this. It's all I can think of, the tears threaten again but I force them back. I'm trying to stay as calm as I can, this has to be reversible right?  
我羞愧地低下头，她的话在脑海中回荡。我告诉他这么做的。我告诉他这么做的。我告诉他这么做的。我满脑子都是这个念头，泪水再次涌上眼眶，但我强忍回去。我尽力保持冷静，这一定可以挽回的，对吧？

Our argument in that kitchen flies back through my mind. I can't shake the feeling that it's no coincidence that I said those things to him, I broke him down and thought for him to end it and then this happened. It's no coincidence that I'm here alone after that, and he is supposedly gone. If that's true though then it means I'm to blame.  
我们在厨房的争吵再次浮现在脑海中。我无法摆脱那种感觉，我对他说的那些话绝非巧合，我击垮了他，让他产生了结束一切的念头，然后就发生了这样的事。在那之后我独自一人，而他据说已经离开，这绝非巧合。但如果这是真的，那就意味着我难辞其咎。

I'm to blame for this, I can't take this. I need to put things right. I need to get back to him. I need to correct this, I can't have driven him to this.  
我对此负有责任，我无法承受。我需要纠正这一切。我需要回到他身边。我需要改正这个错误，我不能让他因此走上绝路。

"Take me back to him."  
"带我回到他身边。"

"I cannot do that." "我做不到。"

"Why not?" "为什么不行？"

I am met with silence and when I finally look up Rei is gone from the stage. I realize I am now alone in this place. Left only with the soft humming of the projector and the heat of the spotlights. I sit on the seat and lean back and I'm aware of another presence in the room. I look up at it and find myself looking straight into the eyes of… me. It's me from the day I first met Shinji on the Over The Rainbow, I'm wearing that yellow sundress I used to be so fond of. She has her hands on her hips mirroring the exact stance I had one that day.  
我面对着沉默，当我终于抬头时，丽已经从舞台上消失了。我意识到自己现在孤身一人在这地方。只剩下放映机的轻柔嗡鸣和聚光灯的热度。我坐在座位上，向后靠去，感觉到房间里还有另一个存在。我抬头望去，发现自己正直视着……我自己的眼睛。那是我在彩虹之上号初次遇见真嗣那天的我，穿着那件我曾非常喜欢的黄色太阳裙。她双手叉腰，与我那天一模一样的姿势。

_"So… this is the infamous Second Child."  
“所以……这就是那位臭名昭著的第二适格者。”_

"Huh?" “啊？”

_"What's wrong idiot? You got what you wanted didn't you? Shinji finally granted your wishes."  
“怎么了，白痴？你不是得到了你想要的吗？真嗣终于满足了你的愿望。”_

"What... I... I never wanted..."  
"什...我...我从没想过..."

_"You asked for this, you know how much he needed you... that he'd do anything for you so he did what you wanted. He removed himself from existence and ended the world... all for us."  
"你知道你要求了什么，你知道他有多需要你...他会为你做任何事，所以他就照你想要的做了。他让自己从存在中消失，终结了这个世界...全是为了我们。"_

"I didn't... I didn't want that, I just wanted... he hurt me... so I..."  
"我没有...我不是想要那样，我只是想要...他伤害了我...所以我..."

_"Liar." "骗子。"_

It's my own voice replayed from in the kitchen.  
那是从厨房里传来的我自己的声音。

_"It didn't matter to do who reached out to you, it could have been anyone. You were scared of them all and you pushed them all away. You were scared of Misato, Ayanami, Hikari, Your own father and when Shinji reached out, you were so scared of him you shoved him away too."  
“无论是谁向你伸出手，都无关紧要，可能是任何人。你害怕他们所有人，并将他们都推开。你害怕美里、绫波、光、你自己的父亲，而当真嗣向你伸出手时，你因为太害怕他，也将他推开了。”_

Suddenly I see another figure join her. It's Shinji and he is staring straight at me. His eyes... I've never seen them like that. All I can do is reel back in the seat in fear. That expression on his face. That look, those eyes. They're cold, piercing and exactly like his fathers.  
突然，我看到另一个身影加入了她。是真嗣，他直直地盯着我。他的眼睛……我从未见过他这样。我只能恐惧地向后缩在座位上。他脸上的表情，那种眼神，冰冷、锐利，和他父亲一模一样。

_"I tried to help you... but you never told me how to help you. You never let me."  
"我曾试图帮助你...但你从未告诉我如何帮你。你从未让我参与。"_

"I... gave you hints..." "我...给了你暗示..."

_"You berated me and called me an idiot. You made me do everything for you because you couldn't be bothered to do it yourself. You belittled me constantly and yet I still wanted to help you, yet I still loved you... now I've gave you what you wanted."  
"你斥责我，叫我傻瓜。你让我为你做一切，因为你懒得自己动手。你不断贬低我，而我依然想帮你，依然爱你...现在我给了你想要的。"_

"No this isn't what I... please Shinji..."  
"不，这不是我...请真嗣..."

For a moment I think I see this Shinji's eyes soften, he speaks one more time.  
有那么一刻，我觉得这个真嗣的眼神柔和了下来，他又说了一次。

_"You're just like me Asuka..."  
"你和我一样，明日香..."_

I blink and immediately they are gone.  
我眨了眨眼，他们立刻就消失了。

Suddenly I hear another voice echoing through the theatre. It's mine only it doesn't sound exactly like me. It's distorted as if I'm hearing it through a pair of cheap headphones. As it speaks the projector sounds again changing the image on screen. Each sentence being said matches the image on the screen. This time it's me looking down on Shinji from on top of my Unit 02.  
突然，我听到另一个声音在剧院中回荡。那是我的声音，但又不太像我。它扭曲着，仿佛我是通过一副廉价的耳机在听。随着它说话，放映机再次响起，改变了屏幕上的图像。每一句话都与屏幕上的图像相匹配。这次是我从我的二号机顶上俯视着真嗣。

With each sentence the images change depicting different stages in my time spent with Shinji. I see me and him in the Entry Plug for Unit 02 when I fought the Angel. I see us both in our outfits learning that ridiculous dance. I see me sleeping next to him in that room. I see me yelling at him. I see me waiting outside his hospital room after he came back from being inside that Angel. I see me after my first major defeat. I see me after I decided to run away from Misato's and stay at Hikari's. I see me saying how much I hated everyone.  
随着每一句话，图像变换，描绘出我和真嗣相处时的不同阶段。我看到我和他在二号机的插入栓里与使徒战斗。我看到我们俩穿着制服学习那荒谬的舞蹈。我看到我在那个房间里睡在他旁边。我看到我对他大喊大叫。我看到他在从那个使徒体内回来后，我在他的医院病房外等待。我看到我在第一次重大失败后。我看到我在决定逃离美里家，留在光的家后。我看到我说我有多恨每个人。

I open my mouth and I speak along with the voices in the theatre, matching it word for word.  
我张开嘴，和剧院里的声音一起说，一字不差地跟上。

"Most of all… I hate myself."  
“最主要的……我恨我自己。”

Another image appears on screen. It's just after we beat the Angel on the volcano. Shinji had dived in against orders and saved my life. I can see me sat in the pool looking at Misato's scar. I look at her.  
屏幕上又出现了另一幅画面。那是在我们击败火山上的使徒之后。真嗣违抗命令跳下去救了我的命。我看到自己坐在水池里，盯着美里小姐的伤疤。我看着她。

_"Hey Misato… you know everything about me don't you?"  
"嘿，美里…你对我了如指掌，对吧？"_

_"I'm your guardian, so yes… I do Asuka."  
"我是你的监护人，所以是的…我了解你，明日香。"_

_"I see…" "我明白了…"_

_"Asuka, it was a long time ago now. Maybe it's time to let things go."  
"明日香，那都是很久以前的事了。也许现在是时候放下这些了。"_

A new voice rings out, it's a clearer one this time. It doesn't belong to me but instead it belongs to our guardian Misato.  
一个新的声音响起，这次更加清晰。这声音不属于我，而是属于我们的守护者美里。

_"Asuka Langley Sohryu, the Second Child. Chosen at the age of four to pilot the Evangelion. She found out the same day her mother committed suicide. That's something no child should ever experience. From then on she has become something of a prodigy, graduating from a respected college at the age of thirteen with a degree in physics. Excelling in her training to become a pilot. The only issue is in the process she has pushed everyone else away. She has nothing to do with her family and she has no friends."  
"惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。四岁时被选中成为 EVA 驾驶员。同一天，她得知母亲自杀的消息。这是任何孩子都不应经历的。从那时起，她便成为了一个神童，十三岁便从一所知名大学毕业，获得物理学学位。在成为驾驶员的训练中表现卓越。唯一的问题是，在这个过程中她疏远了所有人。她与家人断绝了联系，也没有朋友。"_

I listen to her words and mutter a reply, "I… everyone just hurt me or hated me… I…"  
我听着她的话，喃喃回应，“我……每个人都伤害我或讨厌我……我……”

_"You hated yourself because all you could do was hurt others. You hated everyone else because all they could do was hurt you. Whenever they came close you would lash out at them to protect yourself. When you finally felt yourself drawing closer to someone you pushed them away twice as hard."  
“你恨自己，因为你能做的只是伤害别人。你恨其他人，因为他们能做的只是伤害你。每当他们靠近，你就会出于自卫而攻击他们。当你终于感觉到自己在接近某人时，你会用双倍的力量推开他们。”_

I swallow as the words hit me with the force of a truck. I feel the burning return to behind my eyes and try to force out a reply.  
我咽了咽口水，这些话如同一辆卡车般猛烈地击中了我。我感觉眼后的灼热再次袭来，努力试图挤出一个回应。

"No… I… I didn't! I… didn't push them away! They pushed me away! They hated me, they were jealous because of how strong I was, because of how good I was!"  
"不…我…我没有！我…没有推开他们！是他们推开我的！他们恨我，他们嫉妒我，因为我太强大，因为我太优秀！"

Almost immediately I get a reply. Not from Misato but from myself.  
几乎立刻我就收到了回复。不是来自美里，而是来自我自己。

_"Pathetic, you're pathetic. You're not strong at all, after all a strong person wouldn't lose like you did."  
"可悲，你真可悲。你根本不强大，毕竟一个真正强大的人不会像你那样失败。"_

Up above me the project shows a sequence of images. Me in battles against the various Angels. Me being cast aside easily by the Angel possessing Unit 04. My Eva being sliced apart in the Geofront. The attack on my mind from orbit. The time I couldn't even make my Eva move and finally… my final defeat at the hands of the Eva series.  
在我上方，项目展示了一系列图像。我与各种使徒战斗的场景。我被拥有 04 号机体的使徒轻易击退。我的 Eva 在 Geofront 被切开。从轨道上对我心灵的攻击。那次我甚至无法让我的 Eva 动弹，最后……我在 Eva 系列手中的最终失败。

"I… I…" “我……我……”

I try to stutter out some sort of come back for the sequence, some sort of retort but nothing comes to mind. They keep on rolling past, going faster and faster as they do so. From beginning to end, I'm glued to the screen watching image after image of my defeats in the Eva.  
我试图结结巴巴地说出一些反驳的话，一些反驳的话，但什么也想不出来。它们继续滚动，速度越来越快。从开始到结束，我紧盯着屏幕，看着一幅又一幅我在 Eva 中的失败图像。

"No… I'm good, they all… stop… stop showing me this… stop it! STOP IT!"  
"不…我没事，它们…停下…别再给我看这些…停下来！停下来！"

I scream out and the images stop flickering on the screen and I'm left in silence again. My breathing is heavy as I try to regain some semblance of sanity. This is… this doesn't make any sense. What is happening to me here?  
我尖叫着，屏幕上的影像停止闪烁，我又陷入了寂静。我的呼吸沉重，试图恢复些许理智。这…这毫无道理。我这里到底发生了什么？

All I know is I don't want this anymore, I don't want to be here anymore. I want to go home.  
我只知道我再也不想要这样了，我不想再待在这里了。我想回家。

_"I'm worried about Asuka."  
"我很担心明日香。"_

That voice, it's Hikari. I look up at the screen and I see a conversation playing out between Hikari and Shinji.  
那个声音，是光。我抬头看向屏幕，看到光和真嗣之间正在进行的对话。

_"She's been staying at mine for the last couple of days Shinji, all she does is sit there and play video games. She barely eats, she won't come to school, she barely talks… isn't there something you can do?"  
"她这几天一直住在我这里，真嗣，她除了坐在那儿玩游戏什么都不做。她几乎不吃东西，也不来学校，几乎不说话……你就不能做点什么吗？"_

She… spoke to Shinji about me? Did this really happen? I look at the Shinji on the screen, he looks so sad when he hears about me.  
她…和真嗣谈起过我吗？这真的发生过吗？我看着屏幕上的真嗣，当他听到关于我的事情时，他看起来那么悲伤。

_"I… I'll try talking to Misato… maybe she can do something."  
“我…我会试着和美里谈谈…也许她能做些什么。”_

_"Well can't you come and talk to her at least, I'm sure she'd like to see you."  
“那你至少可以过来和她谈谈吧，我相信她会很高兴见到你的。”_

_"I… I can't do that. I'll just make things worse… I'm sorry."  
"我…我做不到。那样只会让事情变得更糟…对不起。"_

Shinji gets up from his seat and walks away from her. Had that actually happened whilst I was at Hikari's? I guess I wouldn't know, I remember Misato coming to get me and I remember running away again that next day.  
真嗣从座位上站起来，远离了她。那件事是在我在光家里时发生的吗？我想我不知道，我只记得美里来接我，第二天我又逃跑了。

Hikari is stood alone, _"I guess he really is scared of her… what did she do to him? I guess… she can be pretty mean to him at times."_  
光独自站着，"我想他真的很怕她…她对他做了什么？我想…她有时对他真的很刻薄。"

"I… I didn't do anything! It was him, he did it all… he wouldn't… he wouldn't…"  
"我…我什么都没做！都是他，他干的…他不会…他不会…"

The image changes again to me sat in the quarantined area after I was attacked from orbit. It shows the moment Shinji made his way to the caution tape to ask if I was alright.  
画面再次切换，显示我坐在被轨道攻击后的隔离区。镜头捕捉到真嗣穿过警戒线来询问我是否安好的那一刻。

"He wouldn't even hold me…"  
"他甚至不愿抱我…"

_"Did you ever let him?"  
"你曾经放过他吗？"_

"Of course I did! I gave him plenty of chances… but he was…"  
"当然放过！我给了他很多机会……但他……"

The image changes again to the night we kissed. It shows me kissing him, my fingers firmly pinching his nose. I can hear the noises we're making as we kiss, I can hear the little gasps I make with each moment. I can hear my mind begging him to hold me.  
画面再次切换到我们接吻的那个夜晚。我看到自己在吻他，手指紧紧捏着他的鼻子。我能听到我们接吻时的声音，听到自己每次亲吻时发出的微弱喘息。我能听到我的内心在恳求他抱紧我。

I look away in shame at what happens next. Him releasing himself from my grasp and catching his breath. Me running into the bathroom pretending to be so offended by the thought of him kissing me. Instead of following me though the image lingers on Shinji's disappointed and confused face, I can see the moment his eyes drop when I yell about using kissing to pass time.  
我羞愧地别开视线，不敢看接下来发生的事。他挣脱我的手，喘着气。我跑进浴室，假装被他吻我的想法冒犯到了。然而，我没有跟进去，脑海中却挥之不去真嗣失望和困惑的脸庞，我能看到当我大喊用接吻打发时间时，他眼中瞬间的失落。

_"Asuka… I'm sorry… I didn't mean to upset you. I don't know what to do."  
“明日香…对不起…我不是有意让你不高兴的。我不知道该怎么办。”_

"No… this isn't… he should have… he should have held me…"  
“不…这不是…他本应该…他本应该抱紧我的…”

My own voice barks back at me, _"Idiot, what were you expecting him to do?"_  
我自己的声音对我吼道：“白痴，你指望他做什么？”

"I… don't know." “我……不知道。”

It's all I can say to reply with. I don't have any form of retort for it. All I can do is look away from the screen with a guilty expression. Just what was I expecting from that night? What was I expecting from any of the times I flirted with him.  
我只能这么回答。对此我无言以对。我只能带着愧疚的表情，移开视线，不再看屏幕。那一晚，我究竟期待着什么？每一次我挑逗他时，我又在期待什么？

_"You berated him, you ground him down, you called him pathetic and perverted and was surprised when he didn't take hold you? He was terrified of you!"  
"你责骂他，你打击他，你骂他无能和变态，然后惊讶于他竟然没有抓住你？他对你害怕极了！"_

"I… I… no… he was never there for me! He did horrible perverted things to me!"  
"我…我…不…他从未在我需要时出现！他对我做了那些可怕的变态事！"

_"Besides where were you when he needed you? Did you bother to hold him? Or visit him in the hospital?"  
"那么在他需要你的时候，你在哪里？你有试着拥抱他吗？或者去医院看望他吗？"_

"He never needed me, he had everyone to deal with him. He had Misato… he had Wondergirl… he had his friends… I had no one!"  
"他从来不需要我，他有那么多人陪伴。他有美里…他有明日香…他有他的朋友们…我什么都没有！"

_"Only because you pushed them away."  
"只是因为你把他们推开了。"_

"I didn't… I didn't want to but they… only liked me because of who I was! They only liked me because of who they thought I was! Even Shinji… he was just… a perverted boy, he never truly liked me!"  
"我没有…我不想这样，但他们…只是因为我是谁才喜欢我！他们只是因为以为我是谁才喜欢我！就连真嗣…他也只是…一个变态的男孩，他从未真正喜欢过我！"

_"What about when you ran away after he was trapped in the Eva for thirty days? Do you remember that?"  
"你还记得他被困在 Eva 里三十天后你逃跑的那次吗？你还记得吗？"_

I look up in horror as the screen changes again. I see myself stood on the catwalk overlooking Unit 01. I hear the wailing of Misato from down below. I watch as the version of myself peers over the railing to look down at Shinji and his body. I can't look away from what happens next. I see the colour drain from this Asuka's face, I see her turn around slowly and stagger back to the locker room.  
当屏幕再次变化时，我惊恐地抬头。我看到自己站在俯瞰 01 单元的走道上。我听到下方传来美里痛苦的哭声。我看着那个自己俯身越过栏杆，望向真嗣和他的身体。接下来的情景我无法移开视线。我看到这个版本的明日香脸色变得苍白，她缓缓转身，踉跄地回到更衣室。

She enters the room and locks the door, she slumps down against the locked door and immediately slips her hand up her skirt. I can hear her gasp as I yell out loudly to anyone who will hear. I remember vividly what happened that day, I remember how sick I felt afterwards for using his image in that way. I remember the pain in my hand from where I bit down to stop myself screaming.  
她进入房间并锁上门，背靠着锁着的门滑坐下来，立刻将手伸进裙子里。我能听到她的喘息声，同时我大声呼喊，希望有人能听见。我清晰地记得那天发生的一切，记得事后因为用他的形象那样做而感到多么恶心。我记得为了不让自己尖叫而咬紧手时手上的疼痛。

"No… stop this… stop showing me this!"  
"不…停下来…别再给我看这些了！"

Immediately the image fades from the theatre. I can feel tears rushing down my face now as I slide off the chair onto my knees.  
影像立刻从剧场中消失。我感到泪水涌出眼眶，顺着脸颊滑落，随即从椅子上滑下，跪倒在地。

"What… why are you showing me these things?"  
"为什么…为什么要让我看到这些？"

I feel a hand on my shoulder and look up at the figure of Rei from earlier.  
我感觉有人把手放在我的肩膀上，抬头一看，是之前见过的丽。

"It is you who is showing yourself these things. These are echoes of the person who is Asuka Langley Sohryu, both in the mind of yourself and others."  
“是你自己在展现这些景象。这些都是明日香·兰格雷的回声，在你和其他人的心中。”

"Make it stop… please… I don't want to see anymore."  
“让它停下来……求你了……我不想再看到了。”

She says nothing but instead the theatre slowly fades out and instead I now find myself stood on a sandy ground. A familiar smell enters my nostrils. Immediately recognizable to me as LCL.  
她一言未发，取而代之的是剧院缓缓淡出，而我发现自己正站在一片沙地上。一股熟悉的气味钻入鼻孔，我立刻认出那是 LCL。

"Where… am I?" “我…在哪里？”

"This is the sea of LCL, where all the souls of mankind have congregated now that the A.T. Fields are down. What you just experienced was a prelude, the deconstruction of yourself. This is where the instrumentality of mankind begins."  
“这里是 LCL 之海，所有人类的灵魂在此汇聚，因为 A.T.力场已经消失。你刚刚经历的是序幕，自我解构的过程。这里，是人类一体化的起点。”

I'm still shaking from being shown those images before, "Instrumentality?"  
我还在因为之前看到的那些图像而颤抖，“人类补完计划？”

"With no A.T. Fields to separate humans, they exist as one singular being. Here there are no secrets, no pain, nothing to hurt them. Here they can seek their own ideal existence. A world to their desire, where pain will not reach them."  
“没有了 A.T.力场来区分人类，他们作为一个单一的个体存在。在这里没有秘密，没有痛苦，没有任何东西能伤害他们。在这里，他们可以追求自己理想的存在。一个符合他们愿望的世界，痛苦将无法触及他们。”

I think about her words. Here people can exist as they desire, they can live their dreams without the hurt or pain we felt in the real world. I look around at the vast emptiness around me. Could I do that then? I could live in a world where my mother didn't die, where I'd be happy but…  
我思考着她的话。在这里，人们可以按照自己的愿望存在，他们可以生活在梦想中，不受现实世界中的伤害或痛苦。我环顾四周的广阔空虚。那么我能做到吗？我可以在一个母亲没有去世、我会幸福的世界里生活，但是……

"Shinji would not exist within it. His existence would be erased, just as he desired it to be."  
"真嗣将不会存在于其中。他的存在将被抹去，正如他所希望的那样。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"If you were to join with them, Shinji would cease to exist for you. That is his wish."  
"如果你与他们结合，真嗣对你来说将不复存在。这是他的愿望。"

We're back to that again, "Why?"  
我们又回到了那个问题，“为什么？”

"You already have the answer."  
"你已经有了答案。"

"Because I told him to do it… because he think it's what I want. A world without him."  
"因为我让他这么做……因为他认为这是我想要的。一个没有他的世界。"

I wonder how many of the people we know have had this conversation, maybe none of them have. Maybe I'm having it now because I'm special just like I always wanted to be. Maybe I'm having it now because it was me that lead to this. I wonder how many have decided to go through with it, how many of our friends are now living that existence without Shinji in their lives. I wonder if I exist for them as well.  
我想知道我们认识的人中有多少进行过这样的对话，也许一个都没有。也许我现在进行这个对话是因为我特别，就像我一直希望的那样。也许我现在进行这个对话是因为我导致了这一切。我想知道有多少人决定继续下去，我们有多少朋友现在正过着没有真嗣的生活。我想知道我是否也存在于他们之中。

"Why… am I here now? Being given this choice?"  
"为什么……我现在会在这里？被赋予这个选择？"

"Because you can stop this from happening?"  
"因为你能够阻止这一切发生？"

"I don't understand, I caused this didn't I?"  
"我不明白，这是我造成的，不是吗？"

Rei merely nods at me, "Shinji sought you out to help him and he relied on you for an answer and is fulfilling what he believes to be your wish."  
丽只是对我点点头，“真嗣找你帮忙，他依赖你给他答案，并实现他认为是你愿望的事情。”

"And if I decide to join with them?"  
“如果我决定加入他们呢？”

"Then Shinji will live an existence on his own, your voice will no longer be able to reach him and humanity will be forever trapped in this state and I will cease to be."  
“那么真嗣将独自生活，你的声音将无法再传达到他，人类将永远困在这种状态中，而我将不复存在。”

I look Rei in the eyes, "Why are you doing this? For me… I was horrible to you. I was horrible to everyone, what makes you think I can do anything now?"  
我直视着丽的双眼，“你为什么要这么做？为了我……我对你很糟糕。我对每个人都那样，你凭什么认为我现在能做些什么？”

"Because Ikari is calling to you."  
“因为碇在呼唤你。”

I close my eyes and smile feeling tears flowing down my cheeks again. Of course he is calling for me. Why wouldn't he, the poor idiot. I think for a moment about joining with the rest of humanity. If I do I'll forget all about him. All of this will never have happened for me, it'll be as if he doesn't exist. Except he will exist and he'll be alone.  
我闭上眼睛，微笑着，泪水再次滑过脸颊。当然，他在呼唤我。他怎么会不呢，这个可怜的傻瓜。我思考了一会儿与人类合而为一的可能性。如果那样做，我会忘记他的一切。所有这些对我来说就像从未发生过，仿佛他不存在一样。但事实上他存在，而且他会孤独一人。

If it wasn't for me he wouldn't have made that choice. If it was the other way round would he come for me? I think about what just happened. When I fought the Eva series.  
如果不是我，他不会做出那个选择。如果角色互换，他会来找我吗？我思考着刚刚发生的事。当我与 Eva 系列战斗时。

"He… abandoned me when I fought the Eva series."  
“他……在我与 Eva 系列战斗时抛弃了我。”

"No, you just think he did. He wanted to but he couldn't. His Eva wouldn't move for him, it was only after it was too late that he was able to do anything."  
“不，你只是这么认为。他想要来，但做不到。他的 Eva 不听使唤，直到为时已晚，他才得以行动。”

I contemplate again joining with them. It'd be over in an instant and I'd forget everything. I wouldn't have any memory of it. I'd have my ideal life, I'd have friends and I'd have… my mother. I could even have Kaji if I wanted. He however, would be here… alone and with no one.  
我再次考虑加入他们。一切将在瞬间结束，我会忘记所有。我不会留下任何记忆。我将拥有理想的生活，我将拥有朋友，我还将拥有……我的母亲。如果我愿意，我甚至可以拥有加持。然而，他将会在这里……孤独一人。

He doesn't deserve that, no one does. If anyone deserves it it's me for pushing him to this point. I can't take that leap knowing what I'd leave behind, knowing that he'd be alone. I might not remember after I've done it but what would that be but running away? The very thing I berated him for, the very thing I told myself I wouldn't do.  
他不值得那样，没有人值得。如果有人应该承受这一切，那就是我，是我将他逼到这个地步。我无法迈出那一步，明知我会留下什么，明知他会孤独一人。即便我做了之后可能不会记得，但那不就是逃避吗？正是我曾批评他的行为，正是我告诉自己绝不会做的事。

"No, he… even if it's just me and him. I won't let him do it. Take me to him."  
“不，他……即使只有我和他。我不会让他这么做。带我去见他。”

**Time to sin before the dawn...  
黎明前的罪恶时刻...**

**_Present Day 当下_**

I'm still snuggled into his back but I can't sleep. I'm thinking about everything that has happened today and that might happen going forward. I'm thinking that now someone has returned things might change for me and Shinji. There is a possibility that tonight could be our last one in this apartment, the last one in which we share this bed or even share each other's warmth like this. It could be out last night together like this and it's ended on him being upset and me repressing my urges for him again. I've been doing it for two weeks now, wanting to make a move but stopping myself. I even got protection from the supermarket a week ago in case of it. I'm so fed up with it.  
我依然蜷缩在他的背后，却无法入睡。我在思考今天发生的一切以及未来可能发生的事情。我在想，现在有人回来了，我和真嗣的生活可能会发生变化。今晚可能是我们在这个公寓的最后一晚，是我们共享这张床甚至彼此温暖的最后一晚。这可能是我们像这样在一起的最后一晚，而它以他生气和我再次压抑对他的欲望结束。我已经这样做了两周，想要采取行动却又阻止自己。一周前我甚至从超市买了保护措施以防万一。我对此感到厌倦透顶。

I'm not content to just lie here next to him and snuggle into him tonight. I need more. I want us to be that couple I imagined earlier, I want us to give ourselves to each other completely. I need him right now. Is isn't like what I tried to do with Kaji, this isn't me trying to prove myself to be an adult. This is a genuine need. I need us to be connected in that way, I need that closeness and I need it right now.  
我并不满足于今晚只是躺在他身边，依偎着他。我需要更多。我希望我们能成为我之前想象中的那种情侣，我希望我们能完全地给予彼此。我现在就需要他。这不像我试图与加持做的事情，这不是我试图证明自己成熟。这是一种真正的需求。我需要我们以那种方式相连，我需要那种亲密，而且我现在就需要。

I release my grip on him and lean my head towards his ear. I whisper  
我松开了对他的拥抱，将头倾向他的耳朵。我轻声说

"Shinji, wake up." “真嗣，醒醒。”

I gently shake him and whisper his name again. "Shinji!"  
我轻轻摇晃他，再次低声呼唤他的名字。“真嗣！”

He starts to stir and I can see him open his eyes in the dim lighting of the room.  
他开始动弹，我看到他在昏暗的房间灯光下睁开了眼睛。

"Asuka, what is it are you alright?"  
“明日香，怎么了？你还好吗？”

I don't reply, instead I pull him around onto his back. I immediately mount him and look into his eyes. I can already see the fear and shock in them.  
我没有回答，而是将他拉过来仰面躺下。我立刻跨坐在他身上，凝视着他的眼睛。我已经能从中看到恐惧和震惊。

"What… what are you doing-"  
“你……你在做什么-”

I can already feel my heart beating in my chest at the thought of what I'm about to do. I look him deep in the eye and tear off my shirt and see his eyes widen at the sight of my breasts.  
一想到即将要做的事，我的心已经在胸腔里狂跳。我深深地注视着他的眼睛，猛地撕开衬衫，看到他因瞥见我的胸部而瞪大了双眼。

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

"Shut up, I don't want words tonight. Just you."  
"闭嘴，今晚我不要言语。只要你就好。"

I lean in and kiss him firmly on the lips. I worry at first that maybe I'm going a bit too far as he makes no move at all but after a time his hand reaches around to cup my face and his tongue slips into my mouth.  
我倾身过去，坚定地吻上他的唇。起初我有些担心是否太过火，因为他毫无反应，但过了一会儿，他的手伸过来捧住我的脸，舌头也探入我的口中。

I wrap my hands around his back placing them firmly on his shoulder blades. Our tongues meet and I wait to see what he does next. It's sort of cute, I feel his trembling hand on the side of my body, it tickles a little bit at first but he gets more confident and it's firmer. Slowly it makes its way up my side. I feel his hand on the side of my breast and slowly it makes its way onto it completely.  
我双手环抱他的背，稳稳地放在他的肩胛骨上。我们的舌头相遇，我等待着他下一步的动作。有点可爱，我感觉到他颤抖的手在我身体的一侧，起初有点痒，但他变得更加自信，手势也更坚定。慢慢地，它沿着我的侧身向上移动。我感觉到他的手触碰到我的乳房一侧，然后缓缓地完全覆盖上去。

I realize that one of my hands is slowly making its way around his body as well. I also notice that it too is trembling but like his is. We continue this for moments, me on top of him kissing him. Our hands running across each other's bodies. We make little gasps as we touch the sensitive parts of each other and then I lean back. I shuffle myself and moan ever so slightly at what I can feel.  
我意识到自己的一只手也在缓缓地环抱住他的身体。同样，我也注意到我的手也在颤抖，就像他的那样。我们继续这样，我压在他身上亲吻他。我们的手在彼此的身体上游走。当我们触碰到对方的敏感部位时，会发出轻微的喘息声，然后我向后仰去。我调整了一下自己的姿势，感受到那股触感时，不禁微微呻吟了一声。

I'm still nervous but I lean in and whisper for him to close his eyes before taking the small box out of the drawer next to the bed. I decide it's now or never. The night continues, and for once I'm thankful we're the only two people in this town.  
我仍然很紧张，但还是俯身轻声让他闭上眼睛，然后从床头柜的抽屉里拿出那个小盒子。我决定现在就是最好的时机。夜晚继续，这一刻我庆幸这个小镇上只有我们两个人。

### Chapter 8 
When I wake up I realize I can't move, it's as if there is a heavy weight on top of me. I slowly up my eyes and see the mass of red hair covering my chest. I see the arm draped across me, and I feel the presence of someone else lying on top of me. My eyes widen more as I turn my head and see Asuka sleeping peacefully, he head resting on my shoulder, her naked chest steadily rising up and down with her breathing.  
当我醒来时，我意识到自己动弹不得，仿佛有重物压在身上。我缓缓睁开双眼，映入眼帘的是一团红发覆盖在我的胸前。我看到横搭在我身上的手臂，以及感受到另一个人的存在躺在我上方。当我转头时，眼睛瞪得更大，只见明日香安详地睡着，头枕在我的肩上，她赤裸的胸膛随着呼吸平稳地起伏。

I realize that aside from the cover we are both completely naked and the memory of last night suddenly comes back to me. What had happened was real, it wasn't just some highly charged erotic dream. It had genuinely happened. I can remember every part of it now, I remember her waking me up and climbing on top of me. I remember feeling her kiss me and I remember how it felt when we made love. I remember hearing screaming her name and her biting into my shoulder.  
我意识到除了被子，我们俩都一丝不挂，昨晚的记忆突然涌上心头。发生的一切都是真的，那不仅仅是一场高度紧张的春梦。它是真实发生的。我现在能记起每一个细节，我记得她唤醒我，爬到我身上。我记得她亲吻我的感觉，以及我们做爱时的感受。我记得我呼喊她的名字，她咬住我的肩膀。

I remember her telling me she loved me as we fell asleep shortly afterwards. For the first time in a long time I actually had nice dreams. There were no nightmares, no sadness or running. Just warmth. I pull the sheet back up to cover us up some more and run my hand up to Asuka's face and gently stroke her hair. I wonder what her dreams are like right now. I know she has nightmares too, I've heard her cry out in her sleep before. I've felt her wake up and hold me tightly to her when she does so.  
我记得她在我们入睡后不久告诉我她爱我。很久以来，我第一次做了美好的梦。没有噩梦，没有悲伤或奔跑，只有温暖。我把床单拉上来多盖住我们一些，手伸向明日香的脸，轻轻抚摸她的头发。我想知道她现在梦见了什么。我知道她也有噩梦，我曾听到她在睡梦中哭泣。我感受过她醒来时紧紧抱住我。

There is a part of me that is questioning the thing last night. I feel some semblance of guilt for it. Did Asuka really want to do that? Or did she do it to make me feel better? After all I had heard yesterday, how upset I was, was this her way of making me feel better. Some gesture of hers to ensure I had one good memory about yesterday.  
我心中有一部分在质疑昨晚的事情。我为此感到一丝愧疚。碇真嗣真的想那么做吗？还是她为了让我感觉好些才那样做的？毕竟昨天我听到了那些事，我那么难过，这是她让我感觉好些的方式吗？她的某种举动，确保我昨天至少有一个美好的记忆。

No, that isn't Asuka. She wouldn't do something like that unless she really wanted to. She wouldn't have put herself through that sort of pain when we first started unless she wanted to. Besides we had been growing closer since we returned. We held each other when we watched movies, we held hands when we went out. She had looked after me when we both returned and she had revealed herself to me only a few weeks ago. That was something… she wanted to do right?  
不，那不是碇真嗣。她不会做那种事，除非她真的想做。在我们刚开始的时候，她不会让自己经历那种痛苦，除非她愿意。而且自从我们回来后，我们的关系越来越近。我们一起看电影时会拥抱，出门时会牵手。我们回来后她一直在照顾我，几周前她才向我敞开心扉。那是……她想做的事，对吧？

Yet I can't shake the feeling that I should feel guilty for something. It's just the same as when I've fantasized about her in the past only this wasn't a fantasy. This was real.  
然而我无法摆脱那种应该感到愧疚的感觉。这和我过去幻想她的情形一样，只是这次不是幻想，这是真实的。

I remove my hand from stroking her hair and I hold it in front of me, looking at it. It's that hand, the same hand I've used on myself… the same hand I used on that day in the hospital… the same hand I used on her last night. I'm about to clench it into a fist but I feel her hand immediately grab me by the wrist.  
我停止抚摸她头发的手，将它举到眼前凝视。这是那只手，曾用于自我慰藉的手……是那天在医院里使用过的手……也是昨晚对她使用过的手。我正要握紧成拳，却感到她的手立刻抓住了我的手腕。

"Mmm… don't stop, that feels nice."  
“嗯……别停，这样感觉很好。”

I stammer out a reply, "A-Asuka, You're awake?"  
我结结巴巴地回应，“A-明日香，你醒了？”

"Yes, now… back to what you were doing."  
"是的，现在…回到你正在做的事情上。"

I unclench my hand and run it through her hair again and feel her react by snuggling her head into my shoulder more. I shift myself a touch as well to free my other arm and place that on her back, I also shift my lower half slightly to avoid Asuka noticing particular reactions in that region.  
我松开紧握的手，再次抚过她的头发，感觉到她将头更深地埋进我的肩膀。我也稍微调整了自己的姿势，以便解放另一只手臂，将其放在她的背上，同时略微调整下半身，以免明日香注意到那里的特定反应。

"Asuka… last night…" "明日香…昨晚…"

I'm not quite sure what to say, I'm not quite sure why I tried to say anything.  
我不太确定该说什么，也不太确定为何我试图说些什么。

"Have you been thinking?"  
“你在思考吗？”

I smile and nod, "Yeah…"  
我微笑着点头，“嗯…”

"Let me guess you feel guilty right? You aren't sure if I wanted to do that. You think I did that just to make you feel better because you were so upset last night over what Fuyutsuki told us? That about cover it?"  
"让我猜猜，你是不是觉得内疚？你不确定我是否真的想那么做。你认为我只是为了让你感觉好些，因为你昨晚因为副司令告诉我们的那些事而那么难过？差不多就是这样吧？"

"Yeah… that covers it." "嗯……差不多就是那样。"

Her hand reaches out of the duvet and slaps me across the top of the head, "Idiot."  
她从被子里伸出手，啪地一声打在我的头顶，"笨蛋。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"Do you really think I'd do something like that unless I really wanted to, unless I really needed to?"  
"你真的以为我会做那种事，除非我真的很想做，除非我真的需要做？"

"I know that but-" “我知道，但是——”

"But nothing, you're an idiot. I did that because I wanted to and believe me I really wanted to. That said, I know what you mean…"  
"但没什么，你是个傻瓜。我那么做是因为我想做，相信我，我真的想做。话虽如此，我知道你的意思……"

"You do…" "你懂……"

"Yeah, I had a brief moment when I woke up where I wondered if maybe I coerced you into it, that maybe I was just using you as a quick excuse to get myself off. That maybe you were just reacting like that because you're a boy and that's how boys react when faced with a girl as beautiful as myself."  
"是啊，我醒来时有那么一会儿怀疑是不是我强迫了你，也许我只是利用你作为迅速解脱的借口。也许你那样反应只是因为你是男孩，面对像我这样美丽的女孩时，男孩们通常会那样反应。"

Asuka had had worries similar to mine as well, I guess it makes sense. I know that for all the front she puts on she can be just as scared as me, she worries about things as well.  
看来明日香也有类似的担忧，这很合理。我知道尽管她表面上装得很坚强，但她和我一样会害怕，也会担心各种事情。

"Oh, well I did… want to do that…"  
"哦，好吧，我确实……想那么做……"

"Oh I know." "哦，我知道。"

"How?" "怎么知道的？"

She looked me directly in the eyes and smiles at me lustfully, "Because I remembered how you screamed my name, now stop thinking for a moment and hold me. I reckon we can have another half an hour of this before Fuyutsuki comes calling for us."  
她直视我的眼睛，淫荡地笑着对我说：“因为我记得你如何尖叫我的名字，现在别想了，抱紧我。我想我们还能再享受半小时，之后副司令就会来找我们了。”

I can hear the familiar sounds of the documentary from the other room as I get ready. I look across to the bedside table and see the product of our exploration last night. A bunch of tissues and an empty wrapper. Amazing how such an intimate act, two people giving themselves to each other completely like we did can result in something that looks so sad.  
我一边准备着，一边能听到从另一个房间传来的熟悉纪录片声响。我望向床头柜，看到了昨晚我们探索的产物：一堆纸巾和一个空包装。真是奇妙，如此亲密的行为，两个人完全交付彼此，就像我们那样，却留下了如此凄凉的景象。

I turn and see myself in the mirror standing with only a bra and pair of panties on. There are a few scratch marks on my shoulder from Shinji but besides that you wouldn't be able to tell what we did. I always wondered about what the first time would be like, it's strange but I don't think I ever did build up an image of the perfect first time. I fantasized about it but it was always short and quick little fantasies of different acts to get me off. I never really had an ideal first time in my head.  
我转身，在镜中看到自己只穿着胸罩和内裤。肩膀上有几道新月形的抓痕，是真嗣留下的，除此之外，看不出我们做了什么。我总是好奇第一次会是什么样子，奇怪的是，我从未构想过完美的初体验。我有过幻想，但总是短暂而迅速，关于不同行为的幻想，让我兴奋。我脑海中从未真正有过理想的初次。

Would last night have been my ideal first time? I could have done without the pain which is still somewhat lingering now but the pleasure I got from him, the pleasure I extracted from him. The way we screamed each others names like we were the last two people on Earth. Yeah... I think last night might have been my ideal first time.  
昨晚会是我的理想初体验吗？如果没有那持续至今的疼痛，或许会更好，但从他那里获得的快感，我给予他的快感。我们呼喊着彼此的名字，仿佛是地球上仅存的两个人。是的...我想昨晚可能就是我的理想初体验。

Since being back I feel like I've regained some of my purpose in life or at least Shinji has somehow given me a new purpose. I'm here to love him, to protect him and look after him.  
自从回来后，我感觉自己似乎重拾了生活的某些目标，或者至少是真嗣以某种方式赋予了我新的使命。我在这里是为了爱他，保护他，照顾他。

I've always felt that since I lost Eva I lost some of my purpose. I lost some of my reason for being and I felt like having lost that I would never find happiness. People liked me because I piloted Eva, in that I was no different from Shinji. I just shown it in a different way. I was aggressive about getting people to notice me because I needed to hear their praise and validation. When I lost that I feared I'd lose that praise and validation. To me I did, Eva was everything, my reason for living. I thought others only saw that in me.  
我一直觉得，自从失去了 EVA，我就失去了一些生活的目的。我失去了存在的某些理由，感觉失去了这些，我将永远找不到幸福。人们喜欢我是因为我驾驶 EVA，在这点上我和真嗣没什么不同。我只是以不同的方式展现出来。我积极地让人们注意到我，因为我需要听到他们的赞美和认可。当我失去这些时，我害怕我会失去那些赞美和认可。对我来说，我确实失去了，EVA 就是一切，我活下去的理由。我以为别人只看到了这一点。

Shinji never did though, I can see that now. He liked me for who I am, he didn't care if I piloted Eva or not. Somehow Shinji fell in love with me, Asuka the person. Asuka the fucked up, wretched human being who pushed people away. He fell in love with that. He's either the sweetest person in the world or the biggest idiot. Maybe he's both. Maybe I shouldn't question why he loves me just like I told him to not question why I wanted to have sex with him last night. Thinking too much always does get us into trouble.  
然而，真嗣从未这样做过，我现在明白了。他喜欢的是我这个人，不在乎我是否驾驶 Eva。不知怎的，真嗣爱上了我，爱上了作为人的明日香。爱上了那个破碎、可怜的明日香，那个推开别人的明日香。他爱上了那样的我。他要么是世界上最温柔的人，要么就是最大的傻瓜。也许两者都是。也许我不该质疑他为什么爱我，就像我告诉他不要质疑我昨晚为什么想和他做爱一样。想得太多总是会给我们带来麻烦。

_"After the Impact incident in the Antarctic all life upon this Earth suffered and our friends in the worlds oceans were not spared this tragedy. Amongst these are the Manta Ray.  
南极冲击事件发生后，地球上所有生命都遭受了苦难，我们在世界海洋中的朋友们也未能幸免于这场悲剧。其中就包括蝠鲼。_

_The Manta Ray could typically be found in tropical waters with a temperature of over twenty degrees Celsius but they have been known to travel outside of these areas from time to time. In the past fifteen years however their numbers have been dwindling until now.  
蝠鲼通常出现在温度超过二十摄氏度的热带水域，但它们有时也会离开这些区域。然而，在过去十五年里，它们的数量一直在减少，直到现在。_

_I'm stood at a special marine facility, one of many around the world that is helping to repopulate the worlds oceans."  
我站在一个特殊的海洋设施前，这是全球众多致力于帮助海洋世界重新繁衍生息的设施之一。_

Asuka is still getting ready in the bedroom as myself and Fuyutsuki sit in the front room. I'm reading the subtitles on the documentary we've been watching since breakfast occasionally picking up the odd word in English. Fuyutsuki has barely said anything to me beyond a greeting and an apology for what he told me about my parents yesterday. He looks as though he wants to say more, but is hesitant.  
明日香还在卧室里准备，我和冬月则坐在客厅。我正在阅读我们自早餐以来一直在看的纪录片上的字幕，偶尔会捡起一些英文单词。冬月除了昨天关于我父母的事情向我打招呼和道歉外，几乎没有对我说什么。他看起来想说更多，但有些犹豫。

"I didn't expect you and Asuka to be interested in this sort of thing."  
“我没想到你和明日香会对这种事情感兴趣。”

He's referring to the documentary. Before Third Impact I probably wasn't and I don't think Asuka had been either. Since we returned though, since we came back to this place we've been watching them a lot. Our favourites are the ones narrated by an American woman called Casey Mongillo. She produced a series of sea based documentaries from around 2008 onwards focusing on the state of the seas after Second Impact. Her documentaries were famous around the world winning a number of awards. I can remember seeing adverts for them appearing on the TV stations here, they were different to other documentaries. She always came across as so human compared to the usual male narrators of these things. You could always sense the genuine passion she had for the subject and she wasn't afraid to show that on screen. I wonder if she has returned from Third Impact yet and what would her ideal world have been? What would she make of the state of the seas now?  
他指的是那部纪录片。在第三次冲击之前，我可能没看过，我想明日香也没看过。但自从我们回来后，自从我们回到这个地方，我们就经常看这些纪录片。我们最喜欢的是一位名叫凯西·蒙吉罗的美国女性解说的系列。她从 2008 年开始制作了一系列关于第二次冲击后海洋状况的海事纪录片，这些纪录片在全球都很有名，赢得了许多奖项。我记得在这里的电视台上看到过它们的广告，它们与其他纪录片不同。与通常的男性解说员相比，她总是显得更有人情味。你总能感受到她对主题的真挚热情，而且她不怕在屏幕上展现出来。我在想，她是否已经从第三次冲击中回来了，她的理想世界会是什么样子？她会如何看待现在的海洋状况？

We've actually already watched this documentary before but we thought it'd be something to put on while we had breakfast and to break up any awkward silences when Fuyutsuki came over. I don't mind watching it again.  
实际上我们已经看过这部纪录片了，但我们觉得在吃早餐时放它，可以打破副校长冬月来访时的尴尬沉默。再看一遍也没关系。

"We...never used to be I guess..."  
“我们...以前大概从未这样想过...”

I pause for a moment, and think about everything that was said yesterday. I know Asuka is mad at Fuyutsuki, I know how angry she is with him. I heard the yelling yesterday, I saw the look in her eyes when she mentioned him coming around earlier this morning. I saw her expression when he apologized but for some reason I'm not angry. I can't bring myself to be angry at him, I know I should be. I know that he was a major factor in what my father did, I know that he hid from both myself and my father what my mother had planned but I can't be angry. I guess it's because he was a victim too in many ways and I suppose in this new world as it is we can't afford to be angry anymore.  
我停顿了一会儿，思考着昨天所说的所有事情。我知道明日香对冬月很生气，我知道她有多愤怒。昨天我听到了她的怒吼，今早提到他来访时我看到了她眼中的神情。当他道歉时，我看到了她的表情，但不知为何，我并不生气。我无法让自己对他生气，我知道我应该生气。我知道他是我父亲所做之事的主要因素，我知道他对我母亲计划的事情对我父亲和我都隐瞒了，但我无法生气。我想，也许是因为在许多方面他也是受害者，而且在这个新世界里，我们可能再也承受不起愤怒了。

Asuka would probably call me an idiot for thinking that way and maybe I am but I just can't be angry. I look over at Fuyutsuki and I finally settle on something to ask, "Do you think animals will return?"  
明日香可能会说我这样想很愚蠢，也许我确实如此，但我就是无法生气。我转头看向冬月，终于决定问些什么，“你觉得动物会回来吗？”

"Animals?" "动物？"

I nod, "Yeah... I mean, what does Third Impact mean for them?"  
我点头，"嗯... 我是说，第三次冲击对它们意味着什么？"

"I don't know... have you not seen any animals since you returned?"  
"我不清楚... 你回来后没见过任何动物吗？"

I shake my head, I don't remember seeing any since we've returned. Does that mean they're all gone? My mother told me that if a person imagines themselves within their own heart they could return but how could a cat or a dog or even a goat do that?  
我摇摇头，自从我们回来后，我不记得见过任何动物。这是否意味着它们都消失了？我母亲曾告诉我，如果一个人在心中想象自己，他们就能回来，但猫、狗甚至山羊又如何能做到这一点呢？

Fuyutsuki pauses for a moment, "I suppose, Lilith was the source of life on this planet it stands to reason that when Third Impact started the animal life was caught up within it as well but... what would happen to it during the process is difficult to say. Whether or not they would return, is another matter. The subject of sentience within animals has always been a hotly debated one."  
冬月停顿了一下，"我想，莉莉丝是这颗星球生命的源泉，当第三次冲击开始时，动物生命也被卷入其中，但...在过程中它们会发生什么，很难说。它们是否会回来，则是另一个问题。关于动物是否具有感知能力的话题，一直是一个激烈争论的焦点。"

"I see..." “我明白了...”

"I know that doesn't really answer your question, I admit... we never really questioned this sort of thing going into the process..."  
"我知道这并没有真正回答你的问题，我承认……我们在进入这个过程之前，从未真正质疑过这类事情……"

"No it's fine... do you think there will be other people out there?"  
"没关系……你觉得外面还会有其他人吗？"

Fuyutsuki nods his head, "Yeah I do actually. I don't know how many but I don't think we'll be the only three in the world to have rejected the process. You have to remember most of the people had been evacuated from this and the surrounding areas at the time of Third Impact. Even this town would have been mostly deserted."  
冬月点了点头，"“是的，我确实这么认为。我不知道有多少，但我想我们不会是世界上唯一拒绝这个过程的三个人。你必须记住，在第三次冲击发生时，大部分人都已经从这个地区及周边撤离了。即使是这个城镇，也几乎会变成空城。”

"But when we got here the cars, the bikes... everything was..."  
"但当我们到达这里时，汽车、自行车……所有的东西都……"

"As if they disappeared?"  
"仿佛它们都消失了？"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"It might have appeared that way but I don't think that was the case. What was likely to have happened was they were all evacuated by coaches and the train. In the wake of the JSSDF attack they were probably rounded up and sent away to Tokyo 2. I can't speak for everyone, there are traces of... LCL around but I think that was more JSSDF occupation than any residents."  
"看起来可能是那样，但我不认为那是事实。更有可能的是，他们都被大巴和火车疏散了。在自卫队攻击之后，他们可能被集中起来送往第二东京。我不能代表所有人，但周围有一些……LCL 的痕迹，我认为那更多是自卫队占领的迹象，而非居民留下的。"

I don't know why but my heart is somewhat lifted by the news. It feels strange but the knowledge that it was only JSSDF in the town at the time of Third Impact makes me feel slightly better. Maybe it's because I no longer feel like the ghosts of those people are watching us as we live here, that they were somewhere else.  
我不知道为什么，但这个消息让我的心稍稍轻松了一些。这种感觉很奇怪，但得知第三次冲击发生时镇上只有日本自卫队，这让我感觉稍微好些。也许是因为我不再觉得那些人的幽灵在看着我们在这里生活，他们当时在别的地方。

Finally after a time Asuka emerges from the bedroom. She glances at me with a small smile which I can't help but return. She turns towards Fuyutsuki, "So, shall we go then?"  
终于，过了一段时间后，明日香从卧室里走了出来。她朝我微微一笑，我不禁回以微笑。她转向冬月，问道：“那么，我们走吧？”

"Yeah, I'll meet you both downstairs."  
“好的，我会在楼下等你们。”

Fuyutsuki turns and leaves the room, I go to leave but Asuka grabs me by the wrist and spins me around. She looks me in the eye and without any warning kisses me on the lips. I return it and slide me hands around her back.  
冬月转身离开了房间，我正要离开，但明日香抓住我的手腕，将我转过身来。她直视我的眼睛，没有任何预兆地吻上了我的唇。我回应着，双手滑向她的背后。

"You sure about this Shinji?"  
“你确定吗，真嗣？”

I nod, "Yeah… I'm feeling a lot better than I was yesterday."  
我点点头，“嗯…我感觉比昨天好多了。”

"Good, oh and Fuyutsuki kinda wanted to give us both a medical check-up while we're there. To ensure we're both alright after we returned, naturally I declined I'd advise you do the same."  
"好，哦，对了，冬月似乎想在我们去的时候给我们俩做个体检。确保我们回来后都没事，当然我拒绝了，我建议你也这么做。"

I look at her confused, "Why did you decline?"  
我困惑地看着她，“你为什么拒绝？”

"Because I feel fine, and I'm not having that old man poke and prod at my body. In case you forgot I don't trust him, and I don't think you should either."  
"因为我感觉很好，而且我不打算让那个老头在我身上戳来戳去。以防你忘了，我不信任他，我觉得你也不应该信任他。"

"I guess but… I don't think he'd try anything. It might be worth doing… we don't really know what might have happened to us."  
"我想是吧，但……我觉得他不会做什么出格的事。或许值得一试……我们其实并不清楚可能会发生什么。"

Asuka pulled away from me and walked to the door, "I suppose, it's your choice if you do it but…"  
明日香从我身边走开，向门口走去，"我想也是，如果你决定这么做的话，那是你的选择……"

She turns to me and winks, "You'd better come up with something creative to explain the bite marks on your shoulder."  
她转向我，眨了眨眼，"你最好想个有创意的借口来解释你肩膀上的咬痕。"

---

The car journey to the shelter was fairly silent, it was that silence that I hate the one where you can feel the tension in the air. Where you can sense someone wants to say something but is afraid to in case they say the wrong thing. Fuyutsuki is understandably awkward around us. It's no surprise considering what he told us yesterday and the guilt he'll likely feel from being part of what he was part of. It's good, I want him to feel that guilt, I want him to feel awkward just so he can maybe get a sense, a fraction of what me and Shinji have felt since we returned.  
前往收容所的车程相当安静，那种我讨厌的沉默，空气中弥漫着紧张感，你能感觉到有人想说些什么却又害怕说错话。福音津在我们周围显得相当尴尬，这并不奇怪，考虑到他昨天告诉我们的那些事，以及他可能会因为参与其中而感到的内疚。这很好，我希望他感受到那种内疚，希望他感到尴尬，这样他或许能体会到我和真嗣自归来后所感受到的一丝一毫。

Shinji on the other hand, well he's naturally quiet anyway. It's sort of cute I suppose depending on the situation. At first his shyness irritated me, it wasn't what I wanted a 'boy' or a 'man' to be. Or at least it wasn't what I thought I wanted. There are other times when he falls silent though that it becomes harder to deal with. When he has something on his mind or when he is upset about something. When I have to fight to get a response. I guess I'm not easy to deal with though so I can forgive it.  
另一方面，真嗣本来就比较安静。这要看情况，有时候还挺可爱的。起初他的羞涩让我感到烦躁，那不是我想要的‘男孩’或‘男人’的样子。或者至少那不是我以为自己想要的。但有时候，当他心里有事或是因为某事而难过时，他的沉默就变得难以应对。当我不得不努力争取一个回应时。我想，我也不是那么容易相处的人，所以我能原谅这一点。

I wonder if its shyness or something on his mind being the reason for his silence this time. We step out of the car and approach the shelter. Fuyutsuki takes a look around inside the small lobby and shakes his head.  
我不禁猜想，这次他的沉默是因为害羞还是心里有事。我们下了车，走向避难所。冬月环视了一下小门厅内部，摇了摇头。

"This is only the lobby, wait until you see inside."  
“这只是门厅，等你进去看看就知道了。”

I'm still sceptical of his words. Shinji might be quick to forgive or trust him but I'm not. I won't forgive this man for what he took part in any time soon and I certainly don't trust him. I don't think he is going to do or try anything but I'm definitely going to be on my guard.  
我对他所说的话仍持怀疑态度。真嗣可能很快就会原谅或信任他，但我不会。我短时间内不会原谅这个人参与的事情，也绝不会信任他。我不认为他会做或尝试任何事，但我肯定会保持警惕。

Fuyutsuki grabs one of the packs from behind the counter and examines the handbook and keycard. He pockets the card and walks over to the elevator. Me and Shinji follow behind and the ride down into the depths of the shelter begin. After a short while the doors open and the familiar corridor is in front of us once again.  
冬月从柜台后抓起一个包裹，检查了手册和钥匙卡。他将卡片放入口袋，走向电梯。我和真嗣紧随其后，电梯缓缓下降，深入避难所的深处。不久，门开了，熟悉的走廊再次出现在我们面前。

"Well where to first?" “那么，先去哪儿呢？”

Fuyutsuki steps outside and walks towards one of the doors.  
冬月走出电梯，朝其中一扇门走去。

"What's on this floor?" “这一层有什么？”

"Mostly apartments, there is a bar/restaurant here, a few conference rooms and what we think are classrooms. Next floor down is mostly the same, although it has two sports halls there. Next floor down looks like a mixture of medical facilities, communications and administration. Below that is storage, maintenance and it looks like there are facilities for growing crops there."  
“主要是公寓，这里有一家酒吧/餐厅，几个会议室和我们认为是教室的地方。下一层也差不多，不过那里有两个体育馆。再下一层看起来像是医疗设施、通讯和行政管理的混合体。再往下是储藏室、维修区和种植作物的设施。”

"I see so they had everything they need here…"  
“我明白了，他们这里应有尽有……”

I nod my head, "Pretty much, and you knew nothing about this place?"  
我点点头，“差不多，你对这个地方一无所知？”

"I knew it existed, just… didn't expect this."  
“我知道它存在，只是……没想到会是这样。”

"And the Commander?" “那指挥官呢？”

Shinji turns at the mention of his father but he remains silent. Fuyutsuki bows his head, "He probably didn't know either. He rarely concerned himself with the affairs of government or businessmen."  
听到父亲的名字，真嗣转过身来，却保持沉默。冬月低下头，“他可能也不知道。他很少关心政府或商人的事务。”

"Too busy plotting the end of the world?"  
“忙着策划世界末日？”

No response from Fuyutsuki, I also see Shinji look away. Well done Asuka, you've managed to make things awkward yet again. In my great need to be antagonist and because I can't just stay quiet I've created a nice silence. I swallow my pride, a rare occasion and apologize.  
冬月没有回应，我也看到真嗣移开了视线。干得好，明日香，你又一次让气氛变得尴尬了。在我迫切想要成为对抗者，因为我无法保持沉默，我制造了一段尴尬的沉默。我吞下自尊，这是难得的时刻，并道歉。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

That's it, that's the best they're getting out of me. Shinji still doesn't say anything, I'm wondering what exactly is up with him. He hasn't said anything since we set off. I should pull him aside later when I get the chance and ask him. Fuyutsuki on the other hand nods, "No need, your anger towards us is understandable."  
就这样了，这是我所能给出的最好态度。真嗣仍然一言不发，我好奇他到底怎么了。自从我们出发后，他一句话都没说过。等有机会，我得找个时间把他拉到一边问问。而副司令福音津则点头道：“不必介怀，你对我们的愤怒是可以理解的。”

I lead the way through the corridor and towards the restaurant area me and Shinji explored before. We duck into the conference rooms and classrooms and finish our tour of this floor back at the elevator.  
我领着大家穿过走廊，前往我和真嗣之前探索过的餐厅区域。我们弯腰进入会议室和教室，最后回到电梯处，完成了这一层的参观。

"Want to go to the next floor or see one of the apartments?"  
“想继续去下一层，还是看看其中一套公寓？”

"Actually I think we can skip the next floor, I'm more interested in seeing the medical facilities. It'd be a good to know what we have access to. Maybe I can have a look at the communications equipment as well."  
“实际上，我觉得我们可以跳过下一层，我更感兴趣的是看看医疗设施。了解一下我们能接触到什么会很有帮助。也许我还可以顺便看看通讯设备。”

"Of course." "当然可以。"

We all step back into the elevator, Fuyutsuki standing at the front with me and Shinji behind. I slip my hand into Shinji's and squeeze it. I see a small smile on his face as I turn around and ask him quietly, "Are you alright?"  
我们再次走进电梯，冬月站在前面，我和真嗣在后面。我悄悄把手伸进真嗣的手中，轻轻握住。我转过身，看到他脸上露出一丝微笑，便轻声问他：“你还好吗？”

"Yeah I'm fine! Just a little bit tired, I err…" He blushes as he speaks, "Didn't get much sleep last night."  
“嗯，我没事！只是有点累，我……”他说着脸红了，“昨晚没怎么睡。”

My first instinct is to ask why and then I remember why, and all I can utter is, "Oh!"  
我的第一反应是想问为什么，但随即我想起了原因，只能发出一声，“哦！”

Thankfully the elevator door pings open at that moment bringing a halt to this discussion. I step out and loudly proclaim, "Here we are, basement level three, medical facilities, communications and administration. Shall we take a look?"  
幸运的是，电梯门在这时叮的一声打开了，打断了这场讨论。我走出电梯，大声宣布：“我们到了，地下三层，医疗设施、通讯和行政管理区。要不要参观一下？”

"Yes let's." “好的，走吧。”

We enter the medical wing, I can already smell the familiar hospital smell here. It's remarkable how they all smell the same, even this one that isn't being used. I hate the smell of these places, I hate how they look, I hate the way your footsteps sound while in them, I hate them so much. Yet here I am wandering this little section of corridors looking in and out of the various rooms. As this was made for the elite there are loads of individual rooms set aside for any patients who would need them. There are a couple of consultation rooms here and room set aside for surgeries. In each room the equipment is fresh and immaculate.  
我们走进医疗翼，我已能闻到这里熟悉的医院气味。令人惊讶的是，它们闻起来都一样，即使是这个未被使用的房间。我讨厌这些地方的气味，讨厌它们的样子，讨厌你在里面走路时的脚步声，我非常讨厌它们。然而，我却在这一小段走廊里徘徊，进出各个房间。由于这是为精英设计的，因此有许多单独的房间为需要它们的病人预留。这里还有几间咨询室和手术室。每个房间里的设备都是崭新且一尘不染的。

Fuyutsuki doesn't say anything as he looks over the varying pieces of equipment. We finally exit the hospital wing, curiously he hasn't said anything about examining either of us. Has he forgotten or is he planning to ask us at a later time?  
冬月没有说什么，他只是审视着各种设备。我们终于离开了医疗翼，奇怪的是，他并没有提到要检查我们。是他忘记了吗，还是他打算稍后再问我们？

"Communications next?" “接下来是通讯室？”

It's Shinji's voice. I can sense a bit of excitement from him when he asks the question. I suppose he wants to learn if there are any other people out there. I suppose he hasn't thought of the potential danger like I have. He doesn't have to either, not while I protect him.  
那是真嗣的声音。我能感觉到他问问题时带着一丝兴奋。我想他可能是想知道外面是否还有其他人。他大概没有像我这样考虑到潜在的危险。他也不需要担心，只要我还在保护他。

Fuyutsuki agrees with him, "Yeah, shall we go?"  
冬月同意他的话，"是啊，我们走吧？"

We leave the corridor and start walking towards the communication rooms. There is only one room for communication but it's a fair large room, there is a big screen on one side of the room and several desks set up. I'm presuming they're for different stations around the world, translating messages and such like. Fuyutsuki moves towards the central station and flips a switch bringing it to life. Various panels light up showing a flat map of the Earth, a few dots are scattered about in other locations. London, Paris, Berlin, Washington, Shanghai. I wonder if these are shelters in those locations or just regular command stations. One light is of course absent, the one labelled Tokyo-3. I suppose that'll have to be renamed to Crater 001 now. There is a light on near to it though, no label is present but I assume it's for this shelter.  
我们离开走廊，开始向通讯室走去。虽然只有一个通讯室，但它相当宽敞，一侧有一块大屏幕，几张桌子摆放着。我猜这些桌子是为世界各地的不同站点准备的，用于翻译信息等。冬月走向中央站点，打开了一个开关，使其启动。各种面板亮起，显示出一幅地球的平面图，上面散布着几个点。伦敦、巴黎、柏林、华盛顿、上海。我不知道这些是那些地方的避难所还是普通的指挥站。当然，有一个光点不见了，标着东京-3 的那个。我想现在它得改名为弹坑 001 了。不过，它附近有一个光点，虽然没有标签，但我猜是这个避难所的。

I suddenly feel butterflies in my stomach as Fuyutsuki scans the map carefully. Not the good kind of butterflies like I had last night. The bad kind, the sort that I felt the moment I saw that lance coming towards me. The kind that told me something bad was about to happen. I wonder for a moment if what we're about to do, attempting to contact the outside world is such a good idea.  
当冬月仔细地审视地图时，我突然感到胃里一阵翻腾，不是昨晚那种美好的蝴蝶感觉。是那种糟糕的感觉，就像我看到那支长矛朝我刺来时的那一刻。那种感觉告诉我，不好的事情即将发生。我一时怀疑，我们即将尝试与外界联系，这究竟是不是个好主意。

"What do the lights on the map mean?"  
“地图上的灯光代表什么？”

My attentions drawn to Shinji question, almost immediately I seize on it. I can't help it but allowing myself to turn for a little bit of time into that old Asuka keeps the butterflies at bay. He'll understand, I hope.  
我的注意力被真嗣的问题吸引，几乎立刻就抓住了它。我忍不住让自己暂时变成那个旧时的明日香，以此来驱散那些蝴蝶。希望他能理解。

"Are you stupid, Isn't it obvious? Those are all the other major shelters and command shelters active around the world!"  
"你是不是傻，这不很明显吗？这些都是全球范围内其他主要避难所和指挥避难所！"

He doesn't seem bothered by my tone, instead his eyes brighten and he responds immediately, "Active! So you mean there are people in them?"  
他似乎并不介意我的语气，反而眼睛一亮，立刻回应道："活跃！你的意思是里面有人？"

Fuyutsuki cuts in, "Possibly, all of the locations had back-up generators to allow them to run on emergency power for a substantial amount of time. It could be that they're in that state right now or they are, as we expect them to be occupied."  
冬月插话道："有可能，所有这些地点都有备用发电机，可以在紧急情况下长时间供电。可能它们现在正处于那种状态，或者正如我们所料，它们已经被占领了。"

"There is a chance though?"  
"不过，还有机会吗？"

"Well of course there's a chance! Didn't I tell you that a while ago?"  
"当然有机会！我不是早就告诉过你吗？"

"Can… can we try to contact them?"  
"我们……能尝试联系他们吗？"

He's really eager and I can't blame him I guess. He clearly hasn't thought the same way I have or Fuyutsuki has. I don't want him to think like that, I really don't but I have to say something. I quickly try to arrange my thoughts in a way that doesn't spoil the mood, which is difficult considering it seems to be one of my specialities.  
他真的很急切，我想我也不能怪他。他显然没有像我和冬月那样思考过。我不希望他那样想，真的不希望，但我必须说些什么。我迅速试图整理我的思绪，以免破坏气氛，考虑到这似乎是我的专长，这很困难。

Fuyutsuki hasn't said anything yet. I was hoping he'd say or do something but it seems he's completely shed the image of him being our sub-commander now. He's not wearing the uniform anymore, instead opting for a more casual shirt and trouser combination. He still has that air of authority to him, but that could just be the way I'm looking at it.  
冬月还没有说任何话。我本希望他会说些什么或做些什么，但看来他现在已经完全摆脱了作为我们副指挥官的形象。他不再穿制服，而是选择了一套更休闲的衬衫和裤子组合。他仍然有一种权威的气息，但这可能只是我看待它的方式。

"We should probably think of who to contact first, and what to say."  
“我们或许应该先考虑联系谁，以及该说些什么。”

Finally he has broken his silence and not a moment too soon. Of course I have to open my mouth, "Yeah, the Sub-Commander probably needs to think of a good lie to tell the world about what happened here!"  
他终于打破了沉默，而且恰到好处。我当然得开口了，“是啊，副司令大概需要想个好谎话来告诉世界这里发生了什么！”

I'm using my most antagonistic tone, I actually hear Shinji protest, "Asuka!"  
我用着最挑衅的语气，实际上听到了真嗣的抗议，“明日香！”

"I'm right though aren't I Fuyutsuki! You know you can't go on there and just say 'Oh hello, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki of NERV, you're going to need to do what you and the Commander perfected, lie. Otherwise if you run into the wrong people they'll just shut you out!"  
“我说得没错吧，副司令！你知道你不能就这样上去说‘哦，你好，NERV 的副司令 Fuyutsuki，你需要做的是你和司令精通的，撒谎。否则要是碰上不该碰的人，他们只会把你拒之门外！’”

Shinji actually tries to argue back but before he can say anything Fuyutsuki responds, "She's right Shinji."  
真嗣其实试图反驳，但还没等他说什么，冬月就回应道：“她说得对，真嗣。”

Please don't mention us, don't mention the JSSDF, if you really want to make amends Fuyutsuki you will not say anything to upset Shinji. I promise if you do any chance I had of forgiving you is gone, out of the window.  
请不要提及我们，不要提及 JSSDF，如果你真的想弥补，冬月，你就不要说任何让真嗣难过的话。我保证，如果你这么做，我原谅你的任何机会都将消失，不复存在。

"Before Third Impact SEELE gave the Japanese government false information pinning me and your father as the two planning to initiate Third Impact. They blamed everything on us and this information will no doubt have made it into the hands of other influential people around the world. If I send a signal out as Sub Command Fuyutsuki of NERV there is a chance something bad will happen."  
在第三次冲击之前，SEELE 向日本政府提供了虚假信息，将我和你父亲列为策划发起第三次冲击的两人。他们把一切都归咎于我们，这些信息无疑已经落入了世界其他有影响力的人手中。如果我以 NERV 副司令冬月的身份发出信号，很可能会发生不好的事情。

"But…" “但是…”

I cut in, "But it'd be true, SEELE were planning Third Impact but it isn't as if Fuyutsuki and your father weren't guilty of having their own agenda surrounding it."  
我插话道，“但那是真的，SEELE 计划进行第三次冲击，但并非说福音津和你的父亲就没有围绕它有自己的议程。”

Shinji sighs and bows his head, "I know that… I just-"  
真嗣叹了口气，低下头，“我知道…我只是—”

Great, now I feel bad I try to recover it, "The rest of the world isn't as forgiving as you Shinji."  
这下好了，我觉得自己真不该试图挽回，“真嗣，世界其他地方可不像你这么宽容。”

"I… sorry…" “我……对不起……”

Damnit he is so frustrating!  
该死的，他真是让人抓狂！

"You idiot! That was a compliment!"  
"你这个傻瓜！那是在夸你呢！"

"It… oh." "它……哦。"

"As far as the world is concerned it was me and your father who were guilty of starting Third Impact. They still won't know of an entity called SEELE and those that will are likely to be silent about it. That means that I…"  
"就世人所知，是我和你父亲引发了第三次冲击。他们仍不知晓一个名为 SEELE 的实体，而那些知情者多半也会保持沉默。这意味着我……"

"Am going to have to act as someone other than Kozo Fuyutsuki to anyone we contact."  
"不得不以不同于冬月耕造的身份与任何人接触。"

"Exactly… we need to assess the state of the world carefully. I can go under a different name for a time, see what allies NERV has in the world. I know there were others investigating NERV and SEELE not unlike Ryoji Kaji."  
"确实……我们需要仔细评估世界的状况。我可以暂时使用另一个名字，看看 NERV 在世界上的盟友有哪些。我知道还有其他人像加持良治一样在调查 NERV 和 SEELE。"

I cringe at the mention of his name, I still remember how I felt about that man. That insane crush I had on him, the way I used to throw myself at him hoping that he'd notice me. The way I'd wear provocative clothing, the way I'd try to get him to be with me all the time. The way I'd think of him on evenings, the things I'd imagine him doing to me. I always told myself I wanted a man like him. That was until I met Shinji.  
提到他的名字让我感到一阵尴尬，我仍然记得我对那个男人的感觉。那段疯狂的迷恋，我曾如何不顾一切地追求他，希望他能注意到我。我穿着挑逗的服装，试图让他一直陪着我。那些夜晚我对他产生的幻想，想象他会对我做些什么。我总是告诉自己，我想要一个像他那样的男人。直到我遇到了真嗣。

Then something changed, I started trying to get Shinji to notice me, I started thinking of him and I started imagining Shinji doing things to me. It disgusted me at first, I tried to make excuses for it all. I tried to force myself to think of Kaji. I told myself that I only provoked Shinji to get a reaction out of a weak boy. I feel Shinjis hand in mine and all I can think is that I really don't deserve it to be there. I think about what we did last night and the way we now hold each other and I wonder if I deserve any of it. Have I really changed from that person or am I just using Shinji to make myself feel better? Am I so desperate for attention that I'm settling for him?  
然后有些事情变了，我开始试图让真嗣注意到我，我开始想着他，开始幻想真嗣对我做些什么。起初这让我感到恶心，我试图为这一切找借口。我试图强迫自己去想加持。我告诉自己，我只是在激怒真嗣，想从一个软弱的男孩那里得到反应。我感受到真嗣的手在我手中，我只能想到我真的不配拥有它。我想起昨晚我们做的事，以及我们现在相拥的方式，我不知道自己是否配得上这一切。我真的从那个人变了吗，还是我只是利用真嗣让自己感觉好些？我是不是如此渴望关注，以至于愿意接受他？

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

I'm stirred from the voice in my head by Shinji's voice. I've never been more thankful to hear it, the questions were spinning around trying to tell me, trying to persuade me that I don't deserve to be happy, that I'm not a good person. I look at him, I've clearly missed something someone has said.  
真嗣的声音将我从内心的声音中唤醒。我从未如此感激听到他的声音，那些问题一直在旋转，试图告诉我，试图说服我不配得到幸福，我不是个好人。我看着他，显然我错过了某人说过的话。

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Fuyutsuki was saying it might be a good idea to get lunch first and talk about what we're going to do during it, what do you think?"  
“副司令说，也许先吃午饭，然后在吃饭时讨论我们要做什么，你觉得怎么样？”

I nod and try to act as if nothing was the in my mind, "Yeah good idea! You can work the kitchen here can't you? I think it's time you treated me to something good for a change!"  
我点点头，试图表现得若无其事，“是啊，好主意！你可以在厨房帮忙，对吧？我觉得是时候你请我吃点好东西换换口味了！”

As we leave the room I ask myself a few questions. Am I really a good person? After all I've said and done, do my actions over the last six weeks make me a good person? Do I deserve to be here with Shinji? I want to be here, I want to protect him but lingering in the back of my head are all the things I've done to him. I can't help but feel I don't deserve it. Does Shinji love me like I love him? He said he does but was that true? Why would he love me? I don't deserve it do I?  
当我们离开房间时，我自问了几个问题。我真的是个好人吗？毕竟我说过做过的一切，过去六周的行为能证明我是个好人吗？我配得上和真嗣在一起吗？我想留在这里，我想保护他，但脑海中挥之不去的是我对他的所作所为。我不禁觉得自己不配得到这一切。真嗣会像我爱他一样爱我吗？他说过他爱我，但那是真的吗？他为什么会爱我？我不配得到这些，对吧？

I'm just going in circles again and I don't know why. I'm starting to feel claustrophobic in this area, I can feel my anger rising just being here. I can feel the butterflies in my stomach churning more and I realize I have to get out of here, for a moment. I need to get some air. I turn to the others.  
我又在原地打转了，不知道为什么。我开始在这个区域感到幽闭恐惧，只是待在这里就让我的怒火上升。我能感觉到胃里的蝴蝶翻腾得更厉害了，我意识到我必须离开这里，哪怕只是一会儿。我需要呼吸点新鲜空气。我转向其他人。

"You guys go ahead, I need to use the bathroom."  
“你们先走，我要去趟洗手间。”

"Sure." "当然。"

I can't believe I'm going against my word and leaving Shinji alone with Fuyutsuki but it'll only be for a moment, I need to get out of here. I need to be on my own for just a brief moment. I watch as they enter the elevator and ride up to the next floor. I call the elevator again and jump in slamming the button for the surface.  
我真不敢相信我会违背自己的承诺，让真嗣和冬月单独待在一起，但这只是暂时的，我需要离开这里。我需要独自待一会儿。我看着他们进入电梯，升到上一层。我又叫了电梯，跳进去，猛按通往地面的按钮。

---

Asuka looked pale when she left us, I hope she is feeling alright. I'm worried about her. She has seemed okay since she broke down in front of me weeks ago but I'm still worried. Maybe she is coming down with something, the nights have been quite cold. I should ask her when she returns but then she'll probably just tell me everything is fine. Even if there was something wrong would she tell me? In our evenings we talk sometimes but it's always focused on me. It's always about how I feel and we never talk about Asuka. The only time we spoke about her was when she broke down in front of me, since then it's been me.  
明日香离开时脸色苍白，希望她感觉还好。我很担心她。自从几周前她在我的面前崩溃后，她看起来一直还好，但我仍然担心。也许她感冒了，最近晚上很冷。等她回来我应该问问她，但她可能会告诉我一切都好。即使有什么问题，她会告诉我吗？晚上我们有时会聊天，但总是围绕着我。总是关于我的感受，我们从未谈及明日香。唯一一次谈到她，是她在我面前崩溃的时候，从那以后，话题一直是我。

I don't know if that is my fault, she is usually the one who asks the questions. She asks me about how I felt when I came to Tokyo 3, she has asked me about my friends and my father. I've tried asking her about herself a couple of times but she always shrugs it off. She tells me it's nothing to be concerned with, she tells me it isn't that interesting but I know it is. I know she wants to help me but I want to help her too. I don't want her to have to build up what is inside until it boils over. The night when she broke down scared me.  
我不知道这是否是我的错，通常是她提问的那个人。她问我刚到第三东京市时的感受，问过我的朋友和父亲。我试着问过她几次关于她自己的事，但她总是轻描淡写地带过。她告诉我没什么好担心的，说那些并不有趣，但我知道不是这样的。我知道她想帮我，但我也想帮她。我不希望她把内心的东西堆积到爆发。她崩溃的那个夜晚让我害怕。

I wish I was brave enough to just push through her words and get at whatever bugs her. I'm scared she'll get angry though and leave and I can't stand the thought of being without her. I need her.  
我希望我有足够的勇气去突破她的言辞，触及困扰她的事情。但我害怕她会生气然后离开，我无法忍受没有她的想法。我需要她。

Me and Fuyutsuki enter the restaurant as my thoughts are still occupied by Asuka. We enter the kitchen and I begin to look in the cupboards at the various tinned goods I can maybe make something out of. I notice Fuyutsuki is looking at me curiously.  
我和冬月进入餐厅，我的思绪仍被明日香占据。我们走进厨房，我开始查看橱柜里的各种罐头食品，试图从中做出点什么。我注意到冬月正好奇地看着我。

"Are you alright with doing that, do you need any help?"  
“你愿意做这件事吗？需要帮忙吗？”

I smile back at him, "Oh, I don't mind. I did the cooking all the time when I lived with Misato and I do most of it now as well. I enjoy it."  
我朝他微笑，“哦，我不介意。我和美里住在一起时经常做饭，现在也大多是我来做。我喜欢做饭。”

I remember when I first started cooking at Misato's, it was actually a day or two after I moved in there. I think I had tasted one of her attempts at food and decided from that moment on I'd do as much cooking as I could. It's strange because usually I don't think I'm very good at things despite others giving me praise for it. When it comes to cooking I know I'm pretty good, I enjoy looking through recipes and even looking through cooking books for things to try.  
我记得第一次在美里家做饭是在搬进去一两天后。我想是因为尝了她做的食物，从那一刻起我就决定尽可能多做饭。这很奇怪，因为通常我不认为自己擅长什么，尽管别人为此称赞我。但说到烹饪，我知道自己做得不错，我喜欢翻阅食谱，甚至浏览烹饪书籍寻找尝试的新菜。

Unusual that I started through necessity, I thought if the Angel's don't kill me then Misato's cooking would have done and ended up enjoying it. Asuka on the other hand, she cooked for us once or twice while she lived with us and it was good. She was as would be expected for someone like her very capable but she just chose to not do it.  
起初是出于无奈，我本以为天使不杀我，也会被美里那糟糕的厨艺放倒，结果却意外地乐在其中。至于明日香，她跟我们一起住时也下厨过一两次，味道不错。以她的能力，本就该如此出色，只是她选择不常动手罢了。

"I see… You're not like your father in that regard."  
“原来如此……你在这方面倒不像你父亲。”

Fuyutsuki looks like he almost immediately regrets mentioning my father but I'm actually interested in what he has to say. I can't say I hate my father, I certainly don't love him at this moment and I don't know if I'll be able to but I am curious about him. I don't know much about him besides the bad stuff.  
副司令看上去几乎立刻就后悔提到了我的父亲，但我其实很想知道他要说些什么。我不能说我恨父亲，当然现在也谈不上爱他，甚至不确定将来能否释怀，但我确实对他充满好奇。除了那些负面的事情，我对他的了解并不多。

"Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned him."  
"对不起，我不该提起他。"

I take a few things out of the cupboards, "No its fine, I… what was he like? Before my mother went into the Eva I mean."  
我从橱柜里拿出几样东西，“不，没关系，我……他以前是什么样的？我是说在我母亲进入 Eva 之前。”

"Well I told you what he was like before he met your mother, he was a confused and I suppose an angry young man. I know little of his past before my initial meeting with him, I don't know what made him that way but he did change when he met your mother. He stopped being angry, he became happier and the other lecturers in the University noticed it as well. Despite my initial reservations your mother and father were good for each other in some ways…"  
“嗯，我告诉过你他遇见你母亲之前的样子，他那时迷茫，我想也是个愤怒的年轻人。我对他遇见我之前的过去知之甚少，不知道是什么让他变成那样，但遇见你母亲后他确实改变了。他不再愤怒，变得快乐起来，大学里的其他讲师也注意到了这一点。尽管我起初有些疑虑，但在某些方面，你母亲和你父亲确实对彼此有益……”

"They did love each other?"  
"他们确实彼此相爱吗？"

"Very much so, I think whatever Gendo was looking for in his life he found with your mother and the other way round. There were some who claimed Gendo was merely looking for a way to get to SEELE but I never believed that."  
"非常相爱，我认为无论碇源堂在生活中寻找什么，他都在你母亲那里找到了，反之亦然。有些人声称碇源堂只是想找到接近 SEELE 的方法，但我从未相信过这一点。"

"Even though you didn't necessarily like him?"  
"即使你并不一定喜欢他？"

"I trusted your mother's judgement. Yui was a brilliant student, she was very clever but I don't think she was a bad judge of character. She saw something in your father others couldn't and she was able to bring that to the surface. It had a profound impact on him, he seemed able to let go of his past and that included his surname."  
"我信任你母亲的判断。优是一位出色的学生，她非常聪明，但我不认为她在识人方面有误。她在你父亲身上看到了别人看不到的东西，并能将其激发出来。这对他产生了深远的影响，他似乎能够放下过去，包括他的姓氏。"

"He took my mother's name didn't he?"  
"他改用了我母亲的姓，对吧？"

"Yes, back in those days that was a rare thing to happen. Nowadays it's not quite as rare but it's still common place for the woman to take the man's name, or even for them to adopt a double barrel surname. Your father took your mother's name with ease."  
"是的，在那个年代，这种情况很罕见。如今虽然不那么稀奇了，但通常还是女方随男方姓，或者采用双姓。你父亲很自然地改用了你母亲的姓。"

"Did you ever see them together?"  
"你见过他们在一起吗？"

"Only after you were born and I had joined NERV. He was… a good father. Nervous around you I suppose as fathers tend to be but he was good. He had no problems taking care of you and doing everything from feeding to changing. He did love you."  
"只有在你出生后，我加入 NERV 的时候。他是个……好父亲。我想他和你在一起时也会紧张，像大多数父亲那样，但他确实很好。照顾你的一切，从喂奶到换尿布，他都毫无问题。他是真的爱你。"

I fight back the burning in my eyes at hearing his words, I don't want to cry here. I've done too much crying recently but this isn't from sadness. It's happiness because they're words I had wanted to hear for a long time. Despite all he has done to me I still wanted to know, I had to know and I'll never hear them from him so hearing them like this is enough.  
听到他的话，我强忍住眼中的灼热，不想在这里流泪。最近我已经哭得太多了，但这不是因为悲伤。这是幸福，因为这些话是我长久以来一直想听到的。尽管他对我做了那么多，我仍然想知道，我必须知道，而我永远无法从他那里听到这些话，所以像这样听到已经足够了。

"Shinji, when your mother vanished so did everything your father gained in that time. He reverted to the scared man I used to know but instead of getting into bar fights he put his effort into something else. A path we shouldn't have gone down and that I should have stopped. Those things I just said, they're true. Your father did love you and even after the incident I know he did but don't think that you have to forgive him, don't think you have to forgive me. Despite her anger and how she comes across Asuka is right… we don't deserve forgiveness."  
"真嗣，当你母亲消失时，你父亲在那段时间所获得的一切也随之消失了。他变回了那个我曾认识的胆怯男人，但不同的是，他没有再去酒吧打架，而是将精力投入到了别的事情上。一条我们本不该走上的道路，一条我本应阻止的道路。我刚才说的那些话，都是真的。你父亲确实爱你，即使在事故之后，我也知道他爱你，但不要认为你必须原谅他，不要认为你必须原谅我。尽管明日香愤怒且表现得如此，但她是对的……我们不配得到宽恕。"

I lower my head listening to his words. I've heard Asuka mention that a lot, how she can't forgive certain people at that mock gravesite I made. People like Fuyutsuki, Ritsuko and although she didn't mention him directly my father. I wonder about the concept of forgiveness. I wanted Asuka to forgive me so much after all I did to her, she wanted my forgiveness but parts of us still wanted to forgive ourselves. Even if we did forgive each other our thoughts still remain because we can't forgive ourselves.  
我低下头，听着他的话。我曾多次听明日香提到，她无法原谅我在那座我制作的假墓地旁的一些人。比如冬月、律子，虽然她没有直接提到，但还有我父亲。我在想宽恕的概念。在我对她做了那么多之后，我多么希望明日香能原谅我，她希望得到我的原谅，但我们内心的一部分仍然想要原谅自己。即使我们彼此原谅了，我们的想法依然存在，因为我们无法原谅自己。

When Fuyutsuki says he doesn't deserve forgiveness is it forgiveness from me he doesn't deserve? From Asuka? Or from himself?  
当冬月说他不配得到宽恕时，是指他不配得到我的宽恕？明日香的？还是他自己的？

"Haven't… wasn't Third Impact, Instrumentality punishment enough though? Learning that the worlds you were in were false, only being able to find false happiness? By coming back you've already been forgiven in some respect."  
“难道……第三次冲击，神识的惩罚还不够吗？得知你所处的世界都是虚假的，只能找到虚幻的幸福？既然你回来了，某种程度上已经得到了宽恕。”

He chuckles, "I didn't expect someone like you to come out with something so profound… I suppose that'll be the influence of your mother."  
他轻笑道，“我没想到像你这样的人能说出这么深刻的话……大概是受你母亲的影响吧。”

I nod, "Maybe, I had a lot of help during Third Impact… from her, from Rei, Kaworu and even Asuka."  
我点头，“也许吧，第三次冲击期间我得到了很多帮助……来自她，来自绫波，来自渚薰，甚至还有惣流。”

"Asuka as well? You two have a strong bond it seems."  
"连明日香也是？看来你们俩关系很紧密呢。"

I blush thinking about just how strong that bond is after last night, "Yeah… she, helped me a lot."  
想到昨晚那紧密关系的程度，我脸红着说，“是啊…她，帮了我很多。”

"I'm glad to hear it."  
"听到这个我很高兴。"

---

Finally the elevator reaches the surface as I run outside and take in some of the air. I don't feel sick anymore but I am still shaking. I allow myself a few moments of this weakness outside as I lean against the wall. I'm trying hard to get all of the thoughts out of my mind or supress them somehow. I try to tell myself I'm an idiot for thinking I'm a bad person and that whatever I did in the past I have to forgive myself for it. I try to tell myself I'm a good person and I do deserve to be loved.  
终于，电梯抵达地面，我冲出室外，深吸了几口空气。恶心感已不复存在，但我仍在颤抖。我允许自己在墙边倚靠片刻，容许这短暂的脆弱。我努力试图将所有思绪赶出脑海，或以某种方式压抑它们。我试图告诉自己，认为自己是个坏人真是愚蠢，无论过去做了什么，我都必须原谅自己。我试图说服自己，我是个好人，我确实值得被爱。

I've been waiting for something like this to happen again but I just didn't expect it to be here while they were around. I was hoping it'd be in an evening when I could deal with it on my own quietly and discretely but I never really get what I want. It'd help if I even knew what I wanted. I don't want to appear weak in front of people, I don't want to have to rely on them but in the back of my mind that is exactly what I want to do. I want to have to suppress my weakness anymore, I don't want to put on that front yet I have to do it. I have to do it because I said I'd protect him for the both of us and if I appear weak in front of him then I can't protect him. He'll lost his confidence in me, just like when I lost in the Eva they lost confidence in me.  
我一直期待着类似的事情再次发生，只是没想到会在这里，在他们身边。我本希望那会是一个夜晚，我可以独自安静而隐秘地处理，但我从未真正得到我想要的。如果我甚至知道自己想要什么，那会有所帮助。我不想在人们面前显得软弱，我不想依赖他们，但在我内心深处，这正是我想做的。我不想再压抑我的弱点，我不想再装腔作势，但我必须这么做。我必须这么做，因为我曾说过我会为我们俩保护他，如果我在他面前显得软弱，我就无法保护他。他会对我失去信心，就像我在 Eva 中失败时他们对我失去信心一样。

"You're such an idiot Asuka, you think he'd abandon you that quickly?"  
“你真是个傻瓜，明日香，你以为他会那么快就抛弃你吗？”

I say the words aloud hoping that hearing them will maybe let me actually absorb them and believe them.  
我大声说出这些话，希望听到它们能让我真正吸收并相信它们。

"You think after all you have gone through together that Shinji would just abandon you for being nervous or scared? You think he's bothered by that, he loves you and that includes your weaknesses. He's forgiven you for what you did like you forgave him, what are you so afraid of?"  
你以为经历了这么多，真嗣会因为你紧张或害怕就抛弃你吗？你以为他会介意这些？他爱你，包括你的弱点。他原谅了你做的一切，就像你原谅他一样，你到底在害怕什么呢？

I have no response for that. I don't really know what I am afraid of. I made a decision a long time ago that I'd never cry in front of people again, that I wouldn't need or rely on people ever again. I made that decision when I was four years old after my mother died. She was the one person I needed and relied on and I was abandoned by her. Making those vows turned me into an unpleasant person and I know that. It lead me down a path where I helped Shinji nearly chose to end the world.  
我对此无言以对。我真的不知道自己在害怕什么。很久以前我就决定，再也不在别人面前哭泣，再也不需要或依赖任何人。这个决定是在我四岁那年母亲去世后做出的。她是我唯一需要和依赖的人，而我却被她抛弃了。这些誓言让我变成了一个不讨人喜欢的人，我知道这一点。它让我走上了一条路，差点让真嗣选择毁灭世界。

I know in the end he didn't and I know that it was in part to do with me that he chose not to. I can't remember what I said after I made the decision to go back to him, after I learned he was calling out to me. I don't know if it was him seeing something in my life that caused him to not do it but it was done and we decided to come back. Yet I'm constantly questioning what I should do, how much of the wall I built around me I should break down and how much I should leave in place.  
我知道最终他没有这么做，我也知道这在一定程度上是因为我，他才选择不这样做。我记不清在我决定回到他身边，在我得知他在呼唤我之后说了些什么。我不知道是不是他看到了我生活中的某些东西，才导致他没有这么做，但事情已经发生了，我们决定回来。然而，我一直在质疑我应该怎么做，我应该拆除多少围绕在我周围的墙，又应该保留多少。

Maybe it's Shinji's fault too, he asks me questions and I casually shrug them off. I tell him I'm alright when I'm not, I tell him things aren't important when they are. He leaves it at that and allows me to dictate the flow of our conversations. If he tried a bit more, maybe I'd reveal more to him. Or maybe that's just wrong, I shouldn't rely on him to push at me to reveal myself.  
也许这也是真嗣的错，他问我问题，我随意地耸耸肩应付过去。我告诉他我没事，尽管我并不好，我告诉他事情不重要，尽管它们确实重要。他就这样接受了，让我主导我们对话的走向。如果他再努力一点，也许我会向他透露更多。或者那只是错误的想法，我不应该依赖他来推动我，让我展现自己。

"I hate this!" “我讨厌这样！”

I look at my watch and decide I should probably get back. They'll probably start wondering where I am. I start to walk back into the shelter and my attention is suddenly drawn to something in the distance.  
我看了看手表，决定或许该回去了。他们可能已经开始好奇我去了哪里。我正要走回避难所，突然间注意力被远处的一个东西吸引。

I look out and I can hear something, a faint sound almost like a helicopters rotor. I look out towards the direction I think it's coming from and I can see something clearly. A black object in the distance moving away from me towards the ocean.  
我向外望去，能听到一些声音，微弱的声响几乎像是直升机的旋翼。我朝我认为声音传来的方向望去，能清楚地看到一些东西。一个黑色的物体在远处，正从我这边向海洋移动。

My heart starts to beat faster again as I quickly rush back inside the cabin. I don't know whether to be excited or scared. There are others out there but who exactly?  
我的心跳再次加速，我迅速冲回小屋。我不知道该感到兴奋还是害怕。外面还有其他人，但究竟是谁呢？

---

Asuka enters the room just as I'm in the middle of putting out the food. I look over and call over to her, "Asuka you were gone a while is everything alright?"  
明日香刚进房间，我正忙着摆餐具。我抬头向她喊道：“明日香，你去了好久，一切都还好吗？”

"Yes fine, I thought I left something in the car so I had to go and check that."  
“嗯，没事，我以为把东西落在车里了，所以得去检查一下。”

"Oh, what was it?" “哦，是什么东西？”

"Nothing important, don't worry about it. Just bring my lunch over, I'm starving."  
“没什么重要的，别担心。把我的午饭拿过来，我快饿死了。”

I set out the three bowls on the table and we begin to eat in silence. There is something different about Asuka, she keeps on looking between me and Fuyutsuki as if she wants to say something. She looks almost nervous about something. It's not something I've seen from Asuka. Maybe I should ask her but then probably not while Fuyutsuki is here. I'll wait until we're alone.  
我在桌上摆好三个碗，我们开始默默吃饭。明日香有些不同，她不停地在我和冬月之间来回看，好像想说些什么。她看起来几乎有些紧张。这不是我见过的明日香。也许我该问问她，但冬月在场可能不太合适。我等我们独处时再说吧。

We finish eating and again in silence move out of the restaurant. I wonder if maybe I should go back and wash our dishes but the two of them insist that it can wait. Asuka reminds me that it isn't like anyone is around to tell us off for leaving a mess.  
我们吃完饭，再次沉默地离开了餐馆。我在想是否应该回去洗碗，但他们俩坚持说可以等一等。明日香提醒我，反正也没人在旁边责备我们留下一片狼藉。

"Was there any sort of procedure put in place in case Third Impact did happen?"  
"如果第三次冲击真的发生了，有没有制定什么应对程序？"

"There were plans for varying levels of disaster."  
"针对不同程度的灾难，确实有相应的计划。"

"So what would they be?"  
"那么这些计划具体是什么呢？"

"It would have depended on how severe the Impact was. Only those in a select inner circle was really aware of what Third Impact meant so other world leaders went off of speculation. It was always assumed it'd be worse than the Second Impact but it was an assumption so they had to cater for other outcomes. Anything from just the city to the entirety of the world was considered."  
"这取决于冲击的严重程度。只有那些被选中的内圈人士真正了解第三次冲击意味着什么，其他世界领导人只能根据猜测行事。人们总是假设它会比第二次冲击更严重，但这毕竟只是假设，所以他们必须考虑其他可能的结果。从仅限于城市到整个世界的影响，都被纳入考虑范围。"

"Did you know of any plans?"  
"你知道有什么计划吗？"

"Some, because I had visited the site of Second Impact and had investigated it I was consulted on a number of things. How safe the environment was around the site of Second Impact, the effects on electronic equipment, wildlife, and so on. It was admittedly difficult to answer some questions, the Second Impact as you know happened in what was already an inhospitable area in the Antarctic so if one was to happen in Tokyo-3 we could only guess."  
"知道一些，因为我曾访问过第二次冲击的现场并进行了调查，所以我被咨询了许多问题。比如第二次冲击现场周围环境的安全性，电子设备的影响，野生动物等等。不可否认，有些问题很难回答，正如你所知，第二次冲击发生在南极洲这样一个原本就不适宜居住的地区，所以如果东京-3 发生类似事件，我们只能猜测其后果。"

He pauses for a moment, "Each country had their own plans for its citizens and survival though. Just as it would have been at the height of the cold-war. It's impossible to say whether any plans made would have been carried out as there were so many variables in play."  
他顿了顿，“每个国家都有自己的计划，为了公民和生存。就像冷战高峰时期一样。由于存在太多变数，很难说这些计划是否会真的实施。”

"What would have been the first thing they'd have done though?"  
“但他们会首先做什么呢？”

"I suppose depending on the level of alliance with Japan or NERV once they're established and back on their feet they'd investigate the source of the Impact. If possible which given what we've seen of the state of the world is doubtful. Why are you asking?"  
“我想，这取决于他们与日本或 NERV 建立的联盟程度。一旦他们站稳脚跟，就会调查冲击的源头。不过，考虑到我们所见的世界现状，这可能性不大。你为什么问这个？”

Asuka shakes her head, "No particular reason, I just think the more we know about what other countries and governments might have had planned will aid us when we make contact with them. If we know what various allies had planned it'll help us know who we can trust. Knowledge is power and that sort of thing."  
明日香摇了摇头，“没什么特别的原因，我只是觉得我们对其他国家和政府可能有的计划了解得越多，在我们与他们接触时就越有帮助。如果我们知道各个盟友的计划，就能更好地判断谁值得信任。知识就是力量，诸如此类。”

"A wise precaution, our main allies were the United Kingdom and Germany so I'd probably advise contacting them first. America and Russia were wary of us, especially when it came to allowing us to build Evangelion Units within Japan. We eventually had to compromise and allow Units and spare parts to be built in a number of locations around the world this was of course on the provision that Unit 00 and Unit 01 were built in Japan."  
“明智的预防措施，我们的主要盟友是英国和德国，所以我建议先联系他们。美国和俄罗斯对我们持谨慎态度，尤其是在允许我们在日本建造 EVA 单位方面。我们最终不得不妥协，允许在世界多个地点建造单位和备用零件，当然前提是 0 号机和 1 号机必须在日本建造。”

I cut in, "Why were they wary of us building the Evangelion Units in Japan?"  
我插话道，“为什么他们对我们在日本建造 EVA 单位持谨慎态度？”

"For the same reason they were wary of having Evangelion equipment build in Germany. Despite the years the nations still have an underlying mistrust of one another. They felt the building of these Units should be handled at locations around the world rather than focused in our sites in Germany and Japan."  
"出于同样的原因，他们对在德国建造《新世纪福音战士》装备持谨慎态度。尽管多年过去，各国之间仍存在潜在的不信任。他们认为这些机体的建造应分散在全球各地，而非集中在我们位于德国和日本的基地。"

"Considering the attacks were going to happen in Japan, that seems stupid. Unless they weren't aware of that?"  
"考虑到袭击将发生在日本，这似乎很愚蠢。除非他们并不知情？"

"They were aware Asuka, we were able to persuade them that we knew the Angels would attack this site in Japan. The existence of Lilith beneath NERV was known to a few select people, even then the Americans tried to insist we move Lilith."  
"他们确实知情，明日香。我们成功说服了他们，我们知道天使会攻击日本这个基地。NERV 地下存在莉莉丝的事实只有少数人知晓，即便如此，美国人还是试图坚持让我们转移莉莉丝。"

"Something you guys were unwilling to do?"  
“你们不愿意做的事情？”

"It got shot down fairly quickly, they were reminded of what happened the last time an Angel like entity was disturbed."  
“这个提议很快就被否决了，他们被提醒了上次打扰类似天使的存在时发生了什么。”

Finally we arrive at the communications room and Fuyutsuki makes his way over to the main console. Me and Asuka stand at the back of the room watching, I slip my hand into hers again and whisper.  
最终我们到达了通讯室，冬月走向主控制台。我和明日香站在房间后方观望，我再次将手滑入她的手中，轻声说道。

"Is everything alright Asuka?"  
"一切都还好吗，明日香？"

"Fine." "好吧。"

She doesn't turn to look at me, nor does she smile. I squeeze her hand a bit, "Are you sure?"  
她没有转头看我，也没有微笑。我轻轻捏了捏她的手，"你确定吗？"

"Yes, I'm sure." "是的，我确定。"

I look at her face again and see she is nervously biting her bottom lip, again I squeeze her hand. I'm really not very good at this, I need to be brave and just push through but I don't want to make her angry.  
我又看了看她的脸，发现她正紧张地咬着下唇，我再次握紧了她的手。我真的不太擅长这个，我需要勇敢一些，直接面对，但我不想惹她生气。

"I know… I'm not very good at this but I'm here if something is wrong…"  
“我知道……我不太擅长这个，但如果有什么不对劲，我在这里……”

Finally she smiles and turns to look me directly in the eyes, "I know, thank you."  
终于，她微笑着转向我，直视我的眼睛，“我知道，谢谢你。”

Brushed off again but she doesn't seem to be getting angry. I almost want to try again but a noise suddenly sounds out from the console. I can feel us both instantly tense up as Fuyutsuki positions a microphone closer to himself.  
又被无视了，但她似乎并未动怒。我几乎想再试一次，但控制台突然发出一声响动。我能感觉到我们两人瞬间紧绷起来，冬月将麦克风移近自己。

"Um… hello, I'm… calling from a shelter just outside of Tokyo-3 to anyone out there. There was an incident, an explosion and I… made it to this shelter… to anyone out there, please respond…"  
“呃……你好，我……从第三新东京市外的一个避难所打来，给任何能听到的人。这里发生了事故，爆炸……我……来到了这个避难所……给任何能听到的人，请回应……”

He turns the microphone off and turns to us both, "And now we wait…"  
他关掉麦克风，转向我们两人，“现在我们只能等待……”

Asuka applauds, "Great performance, going for the scared old man routine. How long do you think we'll have to wait?"  
"明日香鼓掌道：“精彩的表演，装作害怕的老头子。你觉得我们还要等多久？””

As soon as she asks her question there is another noise from the console, he turns back to the screen.  
她刚问完问题，控制台上又传来一阵声响，他转身回到屏幕前。

"Not long at all it seems."  
“似乎并不需要太久。”

A voice rings out, the person speaking has what I recognize to be an English accent but they're speaking Japanese. I can't believe it, there are others out there! Asuka was right and we aren't alone!  
一个声音响起，说话的人带有我辨认出的英式口音，但他们说的是日语。我简直不敢相信，还有其他人存在！明日香说得对，我们并不孤单！

_"Kanagawa Shelter 001, this is NERV-United Kingdom. Are you receiving this message?"  
神奈川避难所 001，这里是 NERV-英国分部。你们收到这条消息了吗？_

"Yeah… we are. Thank you, I was so-"  
是的……我们收到了。谢谢你，我之前真是……

"Thank you sit, can you tell me. Is there anyone else with you at this moment in time?"  
"谢谢您坐下，能告诉我。此时此刻，您身边还有其他人吗？"

Fuyutsuki turns around looks at both me and Asuka. Asuka shakes her head, "No… I'm alone."  
冬月转过身来，看着我和明日香。明日香摇了摇头，"不……我一个人。"

_"And can you tell me what happened?"  
"那您能告诉我发生了什么事吗？"_

"I-I… don't really know. I was at work one day, and there was an explosion and I woke up here on a beach before coming here… please, what is going on?"  
"我…我真的不知道。有一天我在工作，突然发生了爆炸，然后我就在海滩上醒来，之后就来到了这里…请告诉我，到底发生了什么？"

_"Sir please relax, we are currently assessing the situation. Can you tell me where you were when the explosion occurred? Were you in or around Tokyo-3?"  
"先生，请放松，我们正在评估情况。你能告诉我爆炸发生时你在哪里吗？你是在第三新东京市内还是附近？"_

"I-I was in a town nearby, I worked in the city but I was planning on evacuating that day. They were in the process of evacuating us… what happened?"  
"我…我在附近的一个小镇上，我在城里工作，但那天我正打算撤离。他们正在安排我们撤离…到底发生了什么？"

"Sir, remain calm. We will try to assist as we can. We need just one more piece of information. Do you or any of your relatives work for NERV?"  
"先生，请保持冷静。我们会尽力协助。只需要再提供一条信息。您或您的亲属是否在 NERV 工作？"

"NERV? I-I… before the evacuation I did maintenance but I got let go."  
"NERV？我...在疏散前我负责维护工作，但后来被解雇了。"

"Thank you for your co-operation. Please remain where you are and stand by for further instructions."  
"感谢您的合作。请留在原地，等待进一步指示。"

All sound from the station was suddenly muted as Fuyutsuki turns around to meet our stares. I can sense it already, something seemed off about that conversation. The person on the other end, the way they responded and suddenly vanished. I can sense by the look on Fuyutsukis face and Asuka's expression that this wasn't what we were hoping for. I finally speak saying the words that seems to be on everyones mind.  
随着冬月转过身来面对我们的凝视，车站的所有声音突然间消失了。我已能感觉到，那场对话有些不对劲。电话那头的人，他们的回应方式以及突然的消失。从冬月脸上的表情和明日香的神情中，我能感觉到这并非我们所期待的结果。我终于开口说出了似乎在每个人心中盘旋的话。

"We should leave, shouldn't we?"  
“我们应该离开，不是吗？”

### Chapter 10
Have you ever had someone aim a gun at you? I hadn't, until about an hour ago when we came out of that shelter and found ourselves surrounded by a group of men and women all with rifles aimed directly at us. They had no uniform, just a mixture of combat gear and camouflage. All of them were wearing masks and told us not to move as soon as we stepped out. Did they think we were stupid? Like we were going to make a run for it with a six or so rifles aimed at us. I've already died once, didn't like it and it's not gonna happen again any time soon.  
你有过被人用枪指着的经历吗？我以前没有，直到大约一小时前，我们从那个避难所出来，发现自己被一群男女包围，他们的步枪直接对准了我们。他们没有统一的制服，只是混杂着战斗装备和迷彩服。所有人都戴着面罩，我们一踏出避难所，他们就命令我们不要动。他们以为我们是傻子吗？好像我们会在六七支枪的瞄准下逃跑似的。我已经死过一次了，不喜欢那种感觉，而且短期内不打算再经历一次。

The three of us stood there for a moment, my heart pounding in my chest and hands raised in the air until the leader of this group stepped forward. Removing their mask to reveal a woman who couldn't have been more than five years older than me or Shinji. Yeah, a fucking woman, the most innocent one you've ever seen. With tied up dark brown hair and blue eyes was the leader of this group and they were holding us hostage.  
我们三人站在那里片刻，我的心在胸腔里狂跳，双手举在空中，直到这群人的首领走上前来。她摘下面具，露出的女人看起来不超过比我或真嗣大五岁。没错，一个该死的女人，你见过的最无辜的那种。她扎着深棕色的马尾，蓝眼睛，就是这个组织的首领，他们正把我们扣为人质。

They put us into a minibus and transported us back here. I don't know who they are, I don't know how long they've been watching us or known of us. It must have been some time because they knew of the apartment where me and Shinji are right now. Only this time I don't feel quite so safe in here on account of the guard posted outside. I suppose I was right, that must have been a helicopter I saw earlier. I just didn't expect this to happen. I suppose I was right again to have a bad feeling after Fuyutsuki contacted whoever was in that NERV base in the United Kingdom.  
他们把我们塞进一辆小型巴士，带回了这里。我不知道他们是谁，也不知道他们观察我们或了解我们多久了。一定有一段时间了，因为他们知道我和真嗣现在住的公寓。只是这次我在这里感觉不那么安全了，因为外面有守卫。我想我之前是对的，那一定是我之前看到的直升机。我只是没想到会发生这种事。我想我又对了，在富士树联系了英国那座 NERV 基地的某人之后，我就一直有种不祥的预感。

Speaking of Fuyutsuki I don't know where he is. He was transported separately to me and Shinji. He's with their leader now I presume. Probably lying to save his own life. I don't have any faith in him, I don't trust him and as far as I'm concerned all me and Shinji need is each other.  
说到冬月，我不知道他在哪儿。他和我和真嗣被分别传送了。我想他现在应该和他们的头儿在一起。大概是为了保命在撒谎吧。我对他毫无信任可言，在我看来，我和真嗣只需要彼此就够了。

As it is I'm very angry right now, I've not said a word since we returned beyond using some choice language towards the guard. I was sure to tell him in Japanese, German and English what he could do. I'm trying to watch something to calm myself down but it isn't working, I need something else to relieve this anger, something more physical. I look across at Shinji and contemplate a repeat of last night for a moment but I can't even do that. Those idiots could come back in any moment and I don't plan on people seeing us doing that. Maybe I'll just go and punch a wall instead.  
现在我非常生气，自从我们回来后，除了对守卫说了些难听的话，我一句话也没说。我用日语、德语和英语告诉他该怎么做。我试着看些东西来平复心情，但没什么用，我需要一些更实际的方式来发泄这股怒气。我瞥了一眼真嗣，考虑着是否要重演昨晚的事，但我连这也做不到。那些蠢货随时可能回来，我不想让别人看到我们在做那种事。也许我该去打墙一拳算了。

Shinji on the other hand seems calm, he's barely said anything but he isn't showing any signs of being scared. He unlike me has had someone aim a gun at him, much more severe than this so maybe this isn't affecting him. Or maybe he is scared but he just isn't showing it to try to be brave in front of me. Either way his silence as he sorts our CD's out is annoying me.  
另一方面，真嗣看起来很平静，他几乎没说什么，但也没有表现出任何害怕的迹象。他不像我，有人曾用枪指着他，情况比这严重得多，所以也许这对他没什么影响。或者他可能害怕，只是不想在我面前表现出来，试图显得勇敢。无论如何，他在整理 CD 时的沉默让我感到烦躁。

"Hey Asuka…" "嘿，明日香…"

Finally he spoke, I shuffle in the seat to face him. "Yeah?"  
他终于开口了，我挪动座位面对他。“嗯？”

"What's a 'Hogweed'?" “‘大猪草’是什么？”

I'm going to kill him. Of all the questions, of all the things to say at this precise moment in time he says that. He doesn't ask about the group that seem to be holding us captive. He doesn't ask how I'm feeling, he doesn't comment on how I'm feeling. He asks what a 'Hogweed' is.  
我真想宰了他。这么多问题，这么多话可以说，偏偏在这个节骨眼上他问这个。他不问那些似乎把我们囚禁起来的人是谁，也不问我感觉如何，连我心情怎样都不关心。他居然问什么是‘大猪草’。

"What?" "什么？"

"I was… just wondering, it's a track on one of these album, 'The Return of the Giant Hogweed.' I was just wondering what one was…"  
“我只是……有点好奇，这是其中一张专辑里的一首歌，叫《巨型猪草的归来》。我就是想知道那是什么……”

I'll humour him for this moment, "It's a plant. The song is about the spread of a giant plant that someone brought back from Russia to England. For some reason Peter Gabriel was inspired to write a song about it coming alive and killing everyone… is that really an appropriate thing to ask right now?"  
我暂且顺着他的话，“那是一种植物。这首歌讲的是有人从俄罗斯带回英国的一种巨型植物，不知为何彼得·加布里埃尔受启发写了一首关于它复活并杀死所有人的歌……现在问这个真的合适吗？”

"Sorry… I guess not." "对不起…我想不是。"

"You know, you're really calm considering the situation."  
"你知道吗，考虑到这种情况，你真的很冷静。"

There is a bitterness in my voice when I say those words. I hate that he can seem so calm while I have no choice but to outwardly show my anger and frustration. I can't hide it. I see him shake his head slightly and then turn to gaze out of the window, "I'm not calm… I just, I don't know what to do Asuka. I'm terrified, I don't know anything and you and Fuyutsuki seemed so calm… I didn't want you to think I was…"  
当我说话时，我的声音里带着苦涩。我讨厌他能在这种情况下显得如此冷静，而我却别无选择，只能外露我的愤怒和沮丧。我无法隐藏它。我看到他微微摇头，然后转向窗外，"“我并不冷静…我只是，我不知道该怎么做，明日香。我很害怕，我什么都不知道，而你和冬月看起来那么冷静…我不想让你们觉得我…”

He couldn't tell I was scared? The idiot was actually trying to stay calm because he thought I wasn't scared. I stand up and go over to the window and kneel down next to him. I take his hand and place it on my chest just where my heart is so he can feel it beating quickly, "Idiot, I'm scared too."  
他看不出我害怕吗？这个傻瓜其实是在努力保持冷静，因为他以为我不害怕。我站起来，走到窗边，跪在他旁边。我握住他的手，放在我胸口心脏的位置，让他感受它快速跳动，“傻瓜，我也害怕。”

He keeps his hand in place for a moment before gently removing it and placing it on my knee instead, "I was just, trying to not think of it. Who were those people?"  
他把手放在那里片刻，然后轻轻移开，放在我的膝盖上，“我只是，不想去想它。那些人是谁？”

All I can do is shrug, "I don't know. I don't think they're NERV or JSSDF otherwise they'd have uniforms but who knows how much the world has changed over the last six weeks..."  
我只能耸耸肩，“我不知道。我觉得他们不是 NERV 或 JSSDF，否则他们会有制服，但谁知道过去六周世界发生了多大变化……”

"Do you think Fuyutsuki is alright?"  
"你觉得冬月还好吗？"

Again I shrug, "Who knows? I don't know what to think about that man."  
我又耸了耸肩，""谁知道呢？我对那个人没什么想法。"

"You don't trust him do you?"  
"你不信任他，对吧？"

"No, I don't and I don't know how you can either. Not after what he did to us, not after he…"  
"不，我不知道，也不知道你怎么可能知道。在他对我们做了那些事之后，在他……"

I'm about to mention how Fuyutsuki might have known about the MP Eva's abilities so that I wouldn't have been defeated like I had been. I'm about to talk about how Fuyutsuki worked with Shinji's father. I'm about to give a list of reasons but what's the point? I was angry yesterday, I was angry last night and I've been angry most of today. Why add more to it.  
我正要提到冬月可能知道 MP 初号机的能力，这样我就不会像之前那样被打败了。我正要谈论冬月是如何与真嗣的父亲合作的。我正要列举一堆理由，但有什么意义呢？昨天我很生气，昨晚也很生气，今天大部分时间都很生气。何必再添烦恼。

"…It doesn't matter. I just don't trust him alright?"  
"……无所谓了。我就是不信任他，行吗？"

"I don't either…" "我也不…"

"Really?" "真的吗？"

Shinji turns and looks back out of the window, "He… worked with my father and knew what he was going to do. He knew about SEELE, he knew about my mother and he did nothing. He could have helped us, he didn't want to be a part of it either but he let it happen. I… don't trust him but he came back, he made the choice to come back when he could have stayed there and that has to count for something. I think, if people come back they deserve a chance to be forgiven."  
真嗣转过身，再次望向窗外，“他…曾与我父亲共事，知道父亲要做什么。他了解 SEELE，知道我母亲的事，却什么也没做。他本可以帮我们，他也不想参与其中，但他任由这一切发生。我…不信任他，但他回来了，他做出了选择，当可以留在那里时，他选择了回来，这总该算点什么。我认为，如果人们选择回来，他们就值得一个被原谅的机会。”

I look out the window too in the direction of the beach we returned on. I contemplate Shinji's words for a moment. I don't know whether he is an idiot or a wonderful person for what he has just said. Maybe a bit of both.  
我也望向窗外，目光投向我们归来的海滩方向。我沉思着真嗣的话，一时之间，我不知道他是愚蠢还是个了不起的人。或许两者兼而有之。

"What will you do if your father does come back?"  
"如果你的父亲真的回来了，你会怎么做？"

Shinji sighs, "I don't know, probably shy away and avoid him."  
真嗣叹了口气，"我也不知道，大概会躲开他，避免见面吧。"

"Seriously?" "真的吗？"

A sweet little smile appears on his face. There is a look in his eyes, a sadness but also strength too, "Yeah… In my head I want to confront him I suppose. I want to tell him everything he did to me and how it made me feel. I want him to acknowledge me as his son and acknowledge his own cowardice but I just… what'd be the point? It doesn't matter anyway, he got the world he wanted. The one with my mother there, the one where he didn't have to be 'afraid' of hurting me. He can stay there while I carry on here, in reality."  
他脸上露出了一个甜美的小微笑。他的眼神中流露出一种悲伤，但也带着坚强，“是啊……在我心里，我想我应该去面对他。我想告诉他他对我所做的一切以及那让我有何感受。我希望他承认我是他的儿子，承认他自己的懦弱，但我只是……有什么意义呢？反正也不重要，他已经得到了他想要的世界。那个有我母亲在的世界，那个他不必担心会伤害我的世界。他可以留在那里，而我在这里继续前行，在现实中。”

I once teased Shinji over his need for his father to praise him. I once asked him why he craved acknowledgement from the man I knew as the Commander of NERV. I mocked him for it knowing full well that all I ever wanted in my life was to hear praise and receive love from my mother. As I sit here and listen to Shinji say those words, ask what the point is I can't help but feel regret for my past life's actions. I reach up a hand to stroke Shinji on the cheek.  
我曾嘲笑过真嗣需要父亲表扬他的需求。我曾问他为什么渴望得到那个我认识的 NERV 指挥官的认可。我嘲笑他，心里却清楚，我一生中唯一想要的，就是听到母亲的赞扬和得到她的爱。当我坐在这里，听着真嗣说出那些话，问有什么意义时，我忍不住为自己过去的行为感到后悔。我伸出手，轻抚真嗣的脸颊。

"You… I'm sure… I…" “你……我相信……我……”

I don't really know what to say. So instead I lean forward and at the same time pull Shinjis face towards me. I open my mouth ever so slightly as he does the same and kiss Shinji on the lips. I feel him lift his hand and place it on my arm and gently stroke it. He leans in some more as we continue our kiss.  
我真不知道该说什么。于是我向前倾身，同时将真嗣的脸拉向我。我微微张开嘴，他也同样，我们吻上了真嗣的唇。我感觉到他抬起手，放在我的手臂上，轻轻抚摸。他更靠近了一些，我们继续着这个吻。

I suddenly realize something is wrong, in leaning forward I've adjusted my legs so I'm balancing awkwardly. I try to shift my legs again but I can't seem to. I don't want to interrupt the kiss. Shinji's hand is now on my hand and running its way through my hair. I'm trying to concentrate on the kiss but I can feel myself going off balance. Fuck it.  
我突然意识到有些不对劲，向前倾身时我调整了双腿，现在正以一种别扭的姿势保持平衡。我想再次移动双腿，但似乎做不到。我不想打断这个吻。真嗣的手现在放在我的手上，顺着我的头发抚摸。我努力专注于这个吻，但能感觉到自己快要失去平衡。管他呢。

Without giving him any warning, I grab a handful of his shirt and wrap my other arm around him and pull him towards me as I finally topple over. Our kiss finally breaks as we hit the floor and I hear him yell out as we hit the carpet with a muted thump.  
没有给他任何警告，我抓住他的一把衬衫，用另一只手臂环抱住他，将他拉向我，最终我们双双倒下。我们的吻随着撞击地板而中断，我听到他在地毯上发出一声闷响时喊了出来。

He looks concerned for a moment until I break out laughing. Shortly afterwards he follows me and we wrap our arms around each other. Through my giggling I'm able to put out an apology. We lie there laughing with each other, holding each other forgetting where we are. Forgetting about the guard outside our door, the guns we had pointed at us and the people they might be. Instead we lie there listening to Peter Gabriel's stories of little girls and croquet mallets, hogweeds and ancient mystical fountains.  
他看起来有些担忧，直到我突然大笑起来。不久后他也跟着我笑，我们互相拥抱着。我边笑边勉强挤出一句道歉。我们躺在那里，彼此笑着，紧紧相拥，忘记了身处何地。忘记了门外守卫的存在，忘记了曾对着我们的枪口，以及那些可能的人。相反，我们躺在那里，聆听着彼得·加布里埃尔讲述小姑娘、槌球棒、大猪草和古老神秘喷泉的故事。

---

The final notes of the song fade out, I look down and Asuka is nuzzled into my shoulder and tapping out the keyboard section on my side. She looks up at me and prods me on the nose.  
歌曲的最后音符渐渐消失，我低头一看，明日香正依偎在我的肩头，用手指在我身上敲打着键盘部分。她抬头看着我，轻轻戳了戳我的鼻子。

"I'm hungry… what are you going to make us for dinner?"  
“我饿了……你打算给我们做什么晚餐？”

I offer a little shrug as a response. Now that she mentions it I'm hungry as well, it's been a good few hours since we had lunch. I'm about to get up so I can look at what we have but Asuka presses herself against me.  
我微微耸肩作为回应。既然她提起了，我也感到饿了，距离我们吃午饭已经过去好几个小时了。我正要起身去看看我们有什么吃的，但明日香却紧紧贴了上来。

"Don't move yet… you're too comfortable."  
“先别动……你太舒服了。”

I smile and let my hand run itself through her hair. Instead I try to recall from memory what we have. We just got some supplies yesterday so we should have a few things I can put together. I don't really want to move either, this has been nice despite our situation. Lying here together and listening to this music. It probably isn't conventional music for people to snuggle together too but we're hardly conventional. I also liked hearing Asuka tell me all the stories behind the songs and the band itself, about how this album was the first with the bands new drummer and guitarist. How before certain songs the lead singer would tell a story to the audience. For those forty or so minutes I actually forgot about what had happened to us.  
我微笑着，手轻轻穿过她的发丝。我试图从记忆中回想我们有什么食材。昨天刚补充了一些物资，应该有几样东西可以凑合做一顿。其实我也不太想动，尽管处境艰难，这样的时光却很美好。躺在这里，听着音乐，感受彼此的陪伴。这或许不是人们通常用来依偎的音乐，但我们从来就不走寻常路。我也喜欢听明日香讲述每首歌和乐队背后的故事，比如这张专辑是他们新鼓手和吉他手的首次亮相，主唱在某些歌曲前会向观众讲述一个故事。在那四十分钟左右的时间里，我竟然暂时忘记了我们遭遇的一切。

My mind flashes back to them again, that young woman who revealed herself to be the leader. She looked familiar somehow but I can't figure out why. I've never seen her before and nor had Asuka yet there was something about her. I think back to that moment when we emerged from the shelter to have those people stood around us.  
我的思绪再次闪回到他们身上，那位自称是领导者的年轻女子。她看起来有些眼熟，但我却想不出原因。我从未见过她，明日香也没有，但她身上总有些什么。我回想起那一刻，我们从避难所出来，发现那些人围在我们周围。

I've had a gun pointed at me before but that was different. It was after I had visited Asuka in the hospital, I was in the car park in NERV's basement with my headphones in. My SDAT had long since ran out of battery but I left them in anyway. It dulled the noise of the outside world, the sounds of gun fire and the screams around me. More important it gave me an excuse, I could pretend I hadn't heard the alarms and hope someone would kill me. That was when it happened, a JSSDF soldier placed a gun next to my head. I remember his words clearly, 'Nothing personal kid.'  
我曾被人用枪指着，但那次不同。那是在我去医院探望明日香之后，我戴着耳机站在 NERV 地下室的停车场里。我的 SDAT 早已没电，但我还是让它留在耳朵里。它减弱了外界的噪音，枪声和周围的尖叫声。更重要的是，它给了我一个借口，我可以假装没听到警报声，希望有人能结束我的生命。就在那时，一名 JSSDF 士兵把枪放在了我的头上。我清楚地记得他的话，‘别往心里去，孩子。’

I offered no resistance and I actually welcomed it. I thought I deserved it. That was when Misato saved me. That was when she dragged me to the cages and to Evangelion Unit 01. I look down at Asuka smiling as she rests peacefully on my chest. A strange question forms in my mind. If I had have acted differently then, if I had have demanded Unit 01 fight with me and saved Asuka would we still have had a chance of being like this? I had loved her, I know now she had feelings for me but would we have been able to share them if I had saved her or would we have continued as we had before?  
我没有反抗，实际上我还很欢迎。我觉得这是我应得的。就在那时，美里救了我。是她把我拖到了笼子旁，带到了初号机前。我低头看着阿斯卡，她正安详地躺在我胸前微笑。一个奇怪的问题在我脑海中形成。如果我当时采取了不同的行动，如果我要求初号机与我并肩作战并救了阿斯卡，我们是否还有机会像现在这样？我曾经爱过她，现在我知道她对我也有感情，但如果我救了她，我们是否能够分享这些感情，还是会像以前那样继续下去？

Did it really need to be the end of the world for us to admit it?  
真的需要世界末日才能让我们承认这一点吗？

Asuka must be aware of my being lost in thought because I suddenly feel her fingers on my stomach stroking the lower part making me jump. I let out a high pitched noise as she laughs at me. That was one thing she found out last night while we were exploring each other, that I'm very ticklish.  
阿斯卡一定察觉到了我的沉思，因为我突然感觉到她的手指在我的腹部轻抚，让我一跳。她笑了起来，我发出了一声高音。这是昨晚我们在探索彼此时她发现的一件事，我非常怕痒。

"You looked like you were lost in thought, I wanted to bring you back to Earth."  
"你看起来像是陷入了沉思，我想把你拉回现实。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

I pull my shirt back down over my now exposed stomach and look towards the kitchen, "So shall we get some food?"  
我把衬衫重新拉下盖住现在暴露的肚子，朝厨房看去，“那我们去弄点吃的吧？”

She sits up allowing me to also get up, "I suppose so."  
她坐起身，让我也能起来，“我想也是。”

"What do you want?" “你想要什么？”

She stands there thinking for a moment, "Pizza! We managed to salvage some frozen ones didn't we? Just put two of them in the oven."  
她站在那里想了一会儿，“披萨！我们不是抢救了一些冷冻的吗？放两块进烤箱就行了。”

"Sure." "当然。"

I get up to enter the kitchen when a knock at the door gets both our attention. Still standing I watch as the door opens and the young woman from before enters. She is flanked by one of the other men. He is still wearing a mask so I can't see his face. Neither me nor Asuka move from the spot as he closes the door behind him. I notice that they aren't armed. The woman turns and says something to the man, he looks surprised at what she says but then leaves the room leaving only us three in here.  
我起身走向厨房，这时门上传来敲击声，吸引了我们两人的注意。我依旧站着，看着门打开，之前那位年轻女子走了进来。她身边还有另一个男人，他仍戴着面具，我看不清他的脸。我和明日香都没有动，他关上门后，我发现他们并没有携带武器。女子转身对那男人说了些什么，他看起来很惊讶，但还是离开了房间，留下我们三个人在这里。

She turns to face us both before bowing her head, "Allow me to apologize first of all for what has happened here. I hope me and my people did not frighten you too much on our arrival."  
她转过身来面对我们俩，然后低下头，“首先，请允许我为这里发生的事情道歉。我希望我和我的人在到达时没有吓到你们。”

Asuka steps forward, as bold as ever. I guess the lack of guns being involved has allowed her a little bit of confidence. I say nothing as I hear her sarcastically reply, "No not at all, six rifles aimed at me, no words and transported here with a guard placed outside where we're staying. I wasn't in the least bit scared."  
明日香走上前，一如既往地大胆。我想是因为没有涉及枪支，她才稍微有了些自信。我保持沉默，听到她讽刺地回答：“一点儿也不，六支步枪对着我，没有言语，还被带到这里，门外还安排了守卫。我一点儿也不害怕。”

To my surprise the woman actually chuckles a little bit, "You are exactly as you were described Miss Sohryu. Again I am sorry for any distress we caused you and Mr Ikari… if you'll allow me the opportunity to explain."  
令我惊讶的是，这位女士竟然轻声笑了起来，“你正如描述中的那样，惣流小姐。再次为给你和碇君带来的困扰道歉……如果你们愿意给我机会解释的话。”

Asuka replies again, "Go ahead, I'm listening…"  
明日香再次回答道，“说吧，我在听……”

The woman motions to the sofa and we both sit down. The woman however opts to sit on the arm of the chair so she can face us. She pauses for a moment as if she is trying to get her thoughts in order. I still can't shake the feeling that she seems familiar in some way.  
女人示意沙发，我们俩便坐了下来。然而，她选择坐在椅子的扶手上，以便面对我们。她停顿了一下，似乎在整理思绪。我仍然无法摆脱那种感觉，她看起来有些熟悉。

"First I wanted to start by saying we are not your enemies, we are your allies. I know that might seem hard to believe considering the nature of our meeting but I need you to understand that. As you are aware the world has changed…"  
“首先，我想说的是，我们不是你的敌人，我们是你的盟友。我知道这可能难以置信，考虑到我们见面的性质，但我需要你理解这一点。如你所知，世界已经改变了……”

"Oh so someone else noticed! What was the giveaway was it the blood red ocean or the giant fucking head sinking off of the shoreline?"  
“哦，原来还有人注意到了！是什么让你察觉的？是那血红色的海洋，还是岸边沉没的巨大头颅？”

I interject. It isn't that I disagree with Asuka or I'm not a little bit angry but these people have guns and we don't. It's probably best we don't upset them, "Asuka…"  
我插话道。并非我不同意明日香，也不是我不感到一丝愤怒，但这些人有枪，而我们没有。最好不要激怒他们，“明日香……”

Asuka folds her arms and sinks back into the sofa as the woman continues, "My group was set up prior to Third Impact, we were… Well I guess many would call us conspiracy theorists at the time. A group of disenchanted people brought together with a need to uncover the truth behind Second Impact, NERV and SEELE."  
明日香双臂交叉，退回到沙发上，那女人继续说道：“我的团队在第三次冲击之前就成立了，我们……嗯，当时很多人可能会称我们为阴谋论者。一群不满现状的人因为需要揭开第二次冲击、NERV 和 SEELE 背后的真相而聚集在一起。”

I raise my eyebrows suddenly interested in what the woman has to say, "We had a network around the world made up of people who had all lost something in Second Impact and who knew there was more behind it. We are a small group but we have resources, we have people, vehicles, supplies that kind of thing. It was all there in case Third Impact should happen…"  
我突然挑起眉毛，对这位女士要说的话产生了兴趣，“我们有一个遍布全球的网络，由在第二次冲击中失去某些东西并知道背后还有更多内情的人组成。我们虽是一个小团体，但拥有资源、人员、车辆和物资等。这一切都是为了应对第三次冲击的发生……”

Asuka looked over and snarled, "What do you mean in case it should happen? Look around you, it did happen!"  
明日香环顾四周，咆哮道，“你说的‘以防万一’是什么意思？看看周围，冲击已经发生了！”

The woman shakes her head, "Not in the way it was supposed to. The world wasn't destroyed, the Human Instrumentality Project didn't occur in the way it was expected to. I can't imagine what happened but the rest of the world… was spared somehow."  
女人摇了摇头，“并非以预期的方式发生。世界并未被毁灭，人类补完计划也没有按预期进行。我无法想象发生了什么，但世界其他地方……不知怎么地幸免于难。”

I'm stunned and I suddenly feel very lightheaded by her words. I don't know whether to laugh, smile or cry. I look beside me and the scowl hasn't vanished from Asuka's face. Neither of us say anything but let her continue.  
她的这番话让我震惊不已，突然间感到一阵头晕目眩。我不知道该笑、该笑还是该哭。我转头看向旁边，明日香脸上的怒容依旧未消。我们俩都没有说话，只是让她继续。

"That isn't to say things didn't change though… I've prepared a series of news articles, footage and other documents for you both to look through to get you up to speed on the events of the last six weeks but the short version is this. Six weeks ago the UN declared NERV Japan a terrorist organization. They reported that the Japanese Government had been authorised to use force to halt activities at the facility. A few moments later a large energy spike was detected from Japan which engulfed the entire area. The UN and Governments around the world declared a worldwide state of emergency and mass evacuations occurred with everyone fearing a Third Impact.  
“这并不是说事情没有发生变化……我为你们准备了一系列新闻文章、视频和其他文件，让你们快速了解过去六周的事件，但简而言之是这样的。六周前，联合国宣布 NERV 日本为恐怖组织。他们报告称，日本政府已获授权使用武力制止该设施的活动。不久后，日本检测到一次巨大的能量峰值，覆盖了整个区域。联合国和世界各国政府宣布进入全球紧急状态，大规模疏散随即展开，所有人都担心会发生第三次冲击。

There was as you might expect mass panic, those that couldn't get to shelters stayed in cities. Mass looting occurred, towns razed to the ground and it felt like the end of days was truly here. What happened next is hazy. Those outside the shelters reported seeing a big flash of light and suddenly the energy spike had gone.  
正如你可能预料的那样，大规模的恐慌爆发了，那些无法到达避难所的人们留在城市中。大规模的抢劫发生了，城镇被夷为平地，仿佛末日真的来临了。接下来发生的事情变得模糊不清。那些在避难所外的人报告说看到了一道巨大的闪光，突然间能量激增就消失了。

Slowly the UN declared the state of emergency over, the governments allowed their citizens back home and declared publically that everyone was safe. They never told the public the cause of the evacuations, they never addressed the flash of light, instead they spun some lies about NERV and stopping some terrorist attacks and that seemed to satisfy the public."  
慢慢地，联合国宣布紧急状态结束，政府允许公民返回家园，并公开宣布每个人都是安全的。他们从未向公众透露撤离的原因，也从未解释那道闪光，相反，他们编造了一些关于 NERV 阻止恐怖袭击的谎言，这似乎让公众感到满意。

I speak my first words since she came in, "You mean they… everyone in the world is alright?"  
自从她进来后，我第一次开口说话，“你是说他们……世界上每个人都没事？”

"As alright as they can be. Those were three days of global panic… so naturally it has created a delicate atmosphere around the world. Many countries are still trying to destabilize after what happened. Governments are stretched trying to fix the damage caused by their own citizens and also give aid to less fortunate nations. It is… as you might expect complicated."  
"虽然他们尽力了，但那三天的全球恐慌……自然在全球范围内造成了微妙的氛围。许多国家仍在努力从发生的事情中恢复稳定。政府忙于修复本国公民造成的损害，同时还要援助那些更不幸的国家。情况……正如你可能预料的那样复杂。"

"So that'd explain why no one came for us..."  
"所以这就是为什么没人来救我们……"

"Actually Shinji they did try, rescue parties had been sent to Japan but until last week no one was able to get close. On approaching within a certain radius it'd send any navigational equipment haywire. People would enter the area and within moments emerge from the exact point they entered from. It didn't matter how experienced they were they couldn't get to this area. We have been trying ourselves for the past two weeks, it was only today that we managed to make our landing."  
"实际上，真嗣，他们确实尝试过，救援队伍被派往日本，但直到上周，没有人能够接近。在进入某个半径范围内，任何导航设备都会失灵。人们进入该区域后，会在瞬间从他们进入的地点重新出现。无论经验多么丰富，他们都无法到达这个区域。我们自己也在过去两周内尝试过，直到今天才成功着陆。"

"I see…" "我明白了…"

"Look I apologize if all of this is a bit vague or overwhelming for you both. I… I can't begin to imagine what either of you have been through but we are here to help you. Fuyutsuki has already told us some of it. You're welcome to join us tonight in our camp, we have food and other supplies. Of course if you'd rather be left alone for the evening I understand. I promised my Brother that we would do all we can to help you."  
"听着，如果这一切对你们来说有些模糊或难以承受，我深表歉意。我……我无法想象你们经历了什么，但我们在这里是为了帮助你们。冬月已经告诉了我们一些情况。欢迎今晚来我们的营地，我们有食物和其他补给。当然，如果你们更愿意独自度过今晚，我也能理解。我答应过我哥哥，我们会尽一切可能帮助你们。"

Asuka looks across at her, "Your brother? I thought this was your group."  
明日香看向她，"你哥哥？我以为这是你的团队。"

I immediately see a hint of sadness in the woman's eyes as she bows her head. Not in politeness this time but sorrow, "I… my brother was the one responsible for starting this group. I am just carrying out his wishes. He told me before he died that if you two were able to avert Third Impact that I was to do everything I could to help you both afterwards and I don't plan on breaking that promise."  
我立刻注意到这位女士眼中闪过一丝悲伤，她低下头。这次不是出于礼貌，而是悲伤，"我……我哥哥是这个团队的创始人。我只是执行他的遗愿。他在去世前告诉我，如果你们能阻止第三次冲击，我就要尽一切可能帮助你们，我不会违背这个承诺。"

Both me and Asuka bow our heads. Asuka gives a response, lacking in any venom from before, "Sorry… I didn't know."  
我和明日香都低下了头。明日香回应道，语气中已无之前的怨气，“对不起……我不知道。”

"No, I know you didn't. I have to say though you two are exactly as he said you would be. Now I have to return to our camp. I'll leave a radio here, if you need anything please don't hesitate to contact any of us."  
“不，我知道你不知道。不过我得说，你们俩正如他所说的那样。现在我得回我们的营地了。我会留下一个无线电，如果需要什么，请随时联系我们。”

She turns to leave but before she can I shout out. Her last words, about us being exactly as her brother said we would be. I need to know what she meant, "Wait!"  
她转身要走，但我抢在她离开前喊了出来。她最后的话，关于我们正如她哥哥所说的那样，我需要知道她是什么意思，“等等！”

She pauses and turns to face me, I feel myself go slightly red as I stutter out my question, "I-I-I… your brother… what happened to him? How did he know us?"  
她顿了顿，转身面对我，我感到自己的脸微微泛红，结结巴巴地问：“我…我…我…你哥哥…他怎么了？他怎么会认识我们？”

She gives a soft smile, "He delved too far one day, got himself caught and was executed…"  
她微微一笑，“有一天他深入得太远，被抓住并处决了…”

Asuka stiffens next to me in shock as we both realize just who this woman is talking about. It can only be one person, "You mean…"  
明日香在我旁边震惊得僵住了，我们俩都意识到这个女人说的是谁。只可能是那个人，“你是说…”

"Yes, Ryoji was my brother. We lost our parents in Second Impact. He was fifteen at the time, I was only about seven. We like many children who lost families at the time were put into care. He took care of me as best he could but we were only kids so he was limited. Eventually we were separated and lost contact with each other. About three years ago he found me again…"  
"是的，Ryoji 是我哥哥。我们在第二次冲击中失去了父母。那时他十五岁，我才大约七岁。像我们这样在那时失去家庭的许多孩子都被送进了福利机构。他尽其所能照顾我，但我们毕竟只是孩子，所以他的能力有限。最终我们被分开，失去了联系。大约三年前，他又找到了我……"

She pauses for a moment to try to collect her thoughts. I feel Asuka shift uncomfortably next to me as well. Admittedly we both knew very little of Kaji. We knew of his past with Misato, we knew he worked for my father and I knew that he wasn't exactly what he said he was but we didn't know anything about what might have happened to him during Second Impact.  
她停顿了一下，试图整理思绪。我感觉到 Asuka 在我旁边不安地动了动。说实话，我们对 Kaji 的了解非常少。我们知道他与 Misato 的过去，知道他为我的父亲工作，也知道他并不完全是他所说的那样，但我们对他在第二次冲击中可能经历的事情一无所知。

"Sorry we didn't know…" "抱歉，我们不知道……"

"Its fine, I'm guessing he didn't tell you any of this?"  
"没事，我猜他没跟你提过这些吧？"

We both shake our heads and reply in unison, "Nope."  
我们俩同时摇了摇头，异口同声地回答：“没有。”

"Ryoji never liked to talk about himself. He was always willing to listen to others and their problems but when it came to himself he always avoided the subject. It was just his way. He was a good man, if it wasn't for him finding me when he did I don't know what would have happened to me. He rescued me from… well let's just say I wasn't in the best place. He found me, he helped me and eventually he told me the truth."  
"亮司从不爱谈及自己。他总是乐于倾听别人的故事和烦恼，但一旦涉及自己，他总是避而不谈。这是他的习惯。他是个好人，如果不是他及时找到我，我真不知道自己会变成什么样。他把我从……这么说吧，我那时处境堪忧。他找到了我，帮助了我，最终告诉了我真相。"

"He was… I'm sorry about what happened to him."  
"他……我对他的遭遇感到抱歉。"

"Don't worry about it… he knew the risks and made us all aware of that. I've grieved enough for him as I'm sure you all have, the best we can do is continue to find and expose the truth. Now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to my camp."  
"别担心……他知道风险，并让我们都清楚这一点。我想我们都为他哀悼够了，我们能做的最好的事就是继续寻找并揭露真相。现在请原谅，我得回我的营地了。"

"Yeah of course…" "当然……"

She goes to leave but just as she opens the door she turns again, "Rebecca… that's my name. I realize I forgot to tell you."  
她正要离开，却在开门之际又转过身来，“丽贝卡……那是我的名字。我意识到我忘了告诉你。”

"Rebecca?" “丽贝卡？”

She nods and smiles, "Yeah, not a traditional Japanese name. My parents were in Europe when I was conceived and settled on that as a name for some reason. Kinda fits though don't you think?"  
她点点头，微笑道，“是的，不是传统的日本名字。我父母在欧洲时怀上了我，出于某种原因选了这个名字。不过，你不觉得挺合适的吗？”

She leaves the room and we sit in silence. I look across as Asuka who hasn't moved since Rebecca mentioned Kaji. Kaji meant a lot to Asuka, she took the news of his death just as hard as Misato did. I don't really know what to say. All I can do is remember the last time we spoke about Kaji, it was when I told Asuka he was gone. She didn't believe me, she yelled at me and accused me of lying to her.  
她离开了房间，我们沉默地坐着。我望向明日香，自从丽贝卡提到加持后，她就没动过。加持对明日香意义重大，她得知他的死讯时，和美里一样痛苦。我真不知道该说什么。我只能回忆起我们上次谈论加持的情景，那是我告诉明日香他已离世的时候。她不相信我，对我大喊大叫，指责我撒谎。

I take her hand, "Asuka are you…"  
我握住她的手，“明日香，你还好吗……”

"You want to cook those pizzas now?"  
“你现在想做那些披萨吗？”

"But I…" “但我…”

She brushes my hand away, "Just… I didn't realize how little we knew of him."  
她轻轻拂开我的手，“只是…我没想到我们对他的了解如此之少。”

I can't help but feel a little bit envious, "I know… I know how much he meant to you."  
我不禁感到一丝嫉妒，“我知道…我知道他对你有多重要。”

"Idiot, I know what you're thinking."  
"傻瓜，我知道你在想什么。"

"Y-You do?" "你-你知道？"

"Yeah I do. Kaji was everything I thought I ever wanted, he was a real man. He was handsome, funny and smart. I know how I used to act around him, I remember it you know…"  
"是的，我知道。Kaji 曾是我以为我想要的一切，他是个真正的男人。他英俊、幽默又聪明。我记得自己在他面前的样子，你知道的……"

"I'm… sorry I'm not those thi-"  
"我……对不起，我不是那些东……"

"Oh shut up! You know exactly what I had for Kaji was nothing more than some childish fantasy but… I do miss him Shinji because he was nice to us. Despite all of the secrets he was honest to us in some ways and he genuinely cared."  
"哦，闭嘴吧！你知道我对加持的感情不过是些幼稚的幻想，但……我的确想念他，真嗣，因为他对我们很好。尽管他有许多秘密，但在某些方面他对我们很诚实，他是真心关心我们的。"

"I know what you mean."  
"我明白你的意思。"

"Don't get me wrong though, he was very handsome but you…"  
"别误会，他确实很英俊，但你……"

She pulls herself across me straddling herself over my legs. She runs a finger down my chest seductively before leaning in and kissing my neck. I can't help but gasp when she does so. Softly she whispers, "You… are far better."  
她跨过我，双腿搭在我身上，缓缓地用手指沿着我的胸膛滑下，挑逗至极。随后，她俯身亲吻我的脖颈，我不禁倒吸一口气。她轻声细语，"你……更胜一筹。"

---

I roll off of Shinji significantly more satisfied than I was half an hour or so ago. It's funny that as much as I wanted to try to prove I was an adult I always had this weird thing about sex. I would try to push my own sexuality, make my breasts noticeable to certain people and pretend I had more knowledge than I did to them. I would mock someone like Shinji for not noticing when I presented myself to him and call him boring yet turn around the next minute and call him perverted.  
我从真嗣身上滚下来，比起半小时前，我感到无比满足。有趣的是，尽管我一直想证明自己已经成熟，但对于性，我总有些奇怪的念头。我会试图展现自己的性感，让某些人注意到我的胸部，假装自己比实际懂得更多。我会嘲笑像真嗣这样没注意到我展示的人，称他为无趣，但下一分钟又转而骂他变态。

I wasn't unaware of the things Shinji did when he was on his own in his room. I was sure I even heard him one night which definitely helped me. Amusing that I called him perverted yet I was probably worse. Even in my current state of ecstasy I still feel those little bits of guilt at how much I must have fucked him up.  
我并非不知道真嗣独自在房间里做的那些事。我确信有天晚上还听到了他的动静，这无疑帮了我大忙。有趣的是，我曾称他为变态，可我自己或许更甚。即便在当下的极乐之中，我仍感到些许愧疚，意识到自己一定给他带来了不少困扰。

I try to quell those thoughts and instead roll over draping an arm around him and snuggle into his chest. He places his arms around me and runs his hand through my hair. I listen to Shinjis heartbeat as his chest rises and falls in a steady rhythm. Tonight was certainly different to the first time, I wasn't as apprehensive this time and neither was he. We were still nervous but at least we had more of an idea of what to do. It also didn't hurt as much which I was very thankful for.  
我试图平息这些思绪，转而翻身将手臂搭在他身上，紧贴着他的胸膛。他用双臂环抱我，手指轻柔地穿过我的发丝。我聆听着真嗣的心跳，随着他胸膛有节奏地起伏。今晚与初次截然不同，这次我不再那么忐忑，他也是。我们依旧紧张，但至少对接下来要做的事有了更多了解。而且这次也没那么痛，对此我深感庆幸。

I glance up and see another red mark on Shinji's shoulder. I'm hoping that that didn't hurt as much either. I'm going to have to stop doing that, I don't want to create a situation where Shinji has to explain red marks on his shoulders caused by me biting down on him. It's his fault for somehow being so good at it and besides this time I had a reason, I think there is still a guard posted outside the apartment so I had to find something to silence myself.  
我抬头一看，发现真嗣的肩膀上又多了一道红印。希望这次也没那么疼。我得改掉这个习惯，我不想让真嗣因为肩膀上的红印而不得不解释是我咬的。他在这方面不知怎么的太擅长了，而且这次我有理由，我想外面还有守卫，所以我得找点东西来让自己安静下来。

"I'm err… sorry about your shoulder."  
"我……呃……对不起你的肩膀。"

I feel him laugh, "I didn't notice, its fine… I don't mind…"  
我感觉他在笑，“我没注意到，没事的……我不介意……”

"Really? Well… that's good news…"  
"真的吗？嗯…那是个好消息…"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because I plan on marking the other side tomorrow."  
"因为我打算明天在另一边做记号。"

He shifts himself allowing his other warm to go around me and holds me a bit closer. I can feel the sweat from our bodies mixing but tiredness prevents me from caring about that right now. I close my eyes and feel myself start to drift off.  
他挪动身体，让另一只手臂环绕着我，把我抱得更紧了些。我能感觉到我们身体上的汗水混合在一起，但疲惫让我此刻无暇顾及这些。我闭上眼睛，感到自己开始渐渐入睡。

"Hey Asuka…" "嘿，明日香…"

I open one eye curiously, that's Shinjis 'I've been thinking' voice. I prepare myself to shrug whatever he says off. It can wait until the morning.  
我好奇地睁开一只眼睛，那是新治的‘我在思考’的声音。我准备好对他说的任何话都耸耸肩置之不理。这可以等到早上再说。

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

"You were right… about the others in the world coming back."  
“你是对的……关于世界上其他人会回来的事。”

"Of course I was right, that's what I do. Be right about things. Is there a reason for this statement?"  
“我当然是对的，这就是我的本事。对事情做出正确的判断。有什么理由这么说吗？”

"No, I just… I guess, just when I didn't think anyone would return you said they probably already had and you were right. Even though I didn't know it at the time just you saying it made me believe it was true because…"  
"不，我只是……我想，就在我以为没人会回来的时候，你说他们可能已经回来了，而且你是对的。尽管我当时并不知情，但你的话让我相信那是真的，因为……"

"Because I'm perfect in pretty much every single way?"  
"因为我几乎在每一个方面都完美无缺？"

"Yeah… Thank you, you… if you hadn't have come back I don't know what would have happened to me. You… saved me."  
"是的……谢谢你，你……如果你没有回来，我不知道我会怎么样。你……救了我。"

I close my eyes again at hearing those words. I saved him, I actually did something right for a change. I was actually able to carry out something I said I was going to do. I don't know how I did it, I don't know why he let me but I'm grateful to him for giving me the chance. I realize that I can actually feel a tear forming in my eye, I've never cried of happiness before. I quickly wipe it away and snuggle myself further into him so he can't won't get a chance to realize.  
再次听到那些话时，我闭上了眼睛。我救了他，这次我终于做对了。我竟然真的做到了我承诺的事情。我不知道我是怎么做到的，也不知道他为何允许我这么做，但我感激他给了我这个机会。我意识到自己竟然真的因为高兴而眼眶湿润，我从未因幸福而哭泣过。我迅速擦去泪水，更紧地依偎在他怀里，不让他有机会察觉。

"Idiot, go to sleep."  
“傻瓜，快睡吧。”

### Chapter 11 Cataclysm
**Move on, be brave… 继续前行，勇敢面对……**

Within a week of Kaji's sister and her team arriving we were all relocated to that luxury shelter. Naturally I was against it at first. Shinji and I already had somewhere we were living but then people started reappearing at the beach. A mixture of former NERV personnel and JSSDF troops, they were confused. They didn't know what was happening and in the case of the JSSDF troops still ready to carry out their mission. For those reasons we decided that it was best we were out of that town. I can't handle the idea that something might happen to Shinji because of my stubbornness.  
在加治的妹妹和她的小队抵达一周后，我们都被转移到了那个豪华避难所。自然，起初我是反对的。真嗣和我已经有了住处，但随后人们开始在海滩上重新出现。这些人中既有前 NERV 员工，也有 JSSDF 部队，他们都很困惑。他们不知道发生了什么，而 JSSDF 的士兵们仍然准备执行他们的任务。出于这些原因，我们决定最好离开那个小镇。我无法忍受因为我的固执而导致真嗣遭遇不测的想法。

Fortunately Rebecca seems to have quite a way with words and was able to quell any arguments and get everyone on the same page. I have to admit I was impressed, the JSSDF had been ordered to kill anyone associated with NERV before Third Impact. That goal was still imprinted on them and NERV staff had witnessed friends and colleagues be mowed down by these people. Some of them might have even died themselves. Rebecca had somehow managed to alleviate any tension. I suppose the promise of fresh food and a warm room in relative luxury helps.  
幸运的是，丽贝卡似乎很擅长言辞，能够平息任何争执，让所有人达成共识。我不得不承认，我被她折服了，JSSDF 曾被命令在第三次冲击前杀死任何与 NERV 有关联的人。这一目标仍深植于他们心中，而 NERV 的员工目睹了朋友和同事被这些人扫射。有些人甚至可能已经丧命。丽贝卡不知怎么地缓解了所有紧张气氛。我想，相对奢华的环境中提供新鲜食物和温暖房间的承诺也起到了帮助。

So in the course of around one week our small group has grown from just myself and Shinji to three, then to ten and now we sit at around thirty. It was strange at first seeing these people seemingly return from the dead but I suppose I had returned so why couldn't other people. I don't understand how it all works, I don't really want to know but I guess all the souls of the recently dead around the time of Lilith's awakening were caught up in it somehow.  
就这样，大约一周的时间里，我们这个小团体从只有我和真嗣两人，逐渐增加到三个，然后是十个，现在已经有大约三十人了。起初看到这些人仿佛从死里复活，感觉很奇怪，但我想既然我自己都能复活，其他人为什么不行呢。我不明白这一切是如何运作的，也不太想知道，但我想大概是莉莉丝觉醒时，附近所有新近死去的灵魂都被卷入了其中。

People have always asked themselves the question about what happens after we die. Do we just fade into nothingness or does the spirit carry on? I guess we now know the answer, of course it depends on if you have an awakened Seed of Life nearby. I flirted with a stupid idea when I saw these people return, all souls were caught up in Third Impact… did that mean my mother was there as well? I remember her being there with me in the Eva. Was she a part of it as well? I remember seeing her there during it. It was after I visited Shinji, I was taken to my mother but I wonder, was that really her or was it an illusion conjured by my mind.  
人们总是会问自己，死后会发生什么。我们是会化为乌有，还是灵魂会继续存在？我想我们现在知道了答案，当然，这取决于你附近是否有觉醒的生命之种。当我看到这些人复活时，我曾有过一个愚蠢的想法，所有灵魂都被卷入了第三次冲击……这是否意味着我的母亲也在那里？我记得她在 Eva 里和我在一起。她也是其中的一部分吗？我记得在冲击期间看到过她。那是在我拜访真嗣之后，我被带到了母亲那里，但我在想，那真的是她吗，还是我的心灵所制造的幻象。

If it was really her can she come back as well? I looked out across the sea on the day I thought this. Shinji was next to me and I remember not even having to say anything to him about it. He knew what I was thinking. He asked me if I saw her and I nodded my body trembling as I did. I couldn't speak because I knew if I said anything I'd break down in tears. For all my fighting that urge it didn't matter because when he held me I did anyway.  
如果那真的是她，她也能回来吗？那天我望着海面思考着这个问题。真嗣就在我旁边，我记得甚至不需要对他说什么，他就知道我在想什么。他问我是否看到了她，我颤抖着点了点头。我无法开口，因为我知道一旦说话，我就会泪流满面。尽管我努力克制这种冲动，但当真嗣抱住我时，我还是忍不住哭了。

For what it's worth I don't think she'll return. I don't think outside of that experience of Third Impact and the pictures I have of her I'll ever see my mother again. I don't mind though because I finally got the opportunity to say goodbye to her properly, I finally got to hear her voice one more time and I finally had the chance to hear her say 'I love you Asuka' and that'll be enough for me.  
不管怎么说，我认为她不会回来了。除了第三次冲击的经历和那些她的照片，我想我再也见不到妈妈了。不过我并不介意，因为我终于有机会好好地向她告别，终于再次听到了她的声音，终于有机会听到她说‘我爱你，明日香’，这对我来说已经足够了。

---

"Um… Asuka… do we really need all of these?"  
“呃…明日香…我们真的需要这么多吗？”

I look around nervously watching out for anyone nearby as Asuka disappears once again into the room in the market. I will never get used to this. I look down in the trolley at the stack of video games she has thrown in there alongside other things.  
我紧张地环顾四周，留意着附近是否有人，而明日香又一次消失在市场里的房间中。我永远无法习惯这种感觉。我低头看向手推车里，她扔进去的一堆电子游戏和其他物品堆在一起。

"…besides you know we could have just asked one of Rebecca's people to get this for us."  
“…再说了，你知道我们本可以请丽贝卡的人帮我们买这些东西的。”

She finally emerges from the room with a games console in her hands and a few accessories. She glares at me like I've said something stupid, which to be fair is likely. She places the console into the trolley and takes it from me.  
她终于从房间里出来，手里拿着一台游戏机和几个配件。她瞪着我，好像我说了什么蠢话，公平地说，这很有可能。她把游戏机放进手推车，然后从我手中接过车。

"Yeah we could have done that Shinji but you forget this isn't everything we came here for and as much as we get on with her people I'm not quite at the stage where I'm comfortable saying, 'Hey Rebecca do you think you and your people could go out steal us a Playstation, a few games, controllers oh and condoms too so me and my boyfriend can fuck!' Think about it for a moment Shinji."  
“是啊，我们可以那么做，真嗣，但你忘了我们来这里的目的不仅仅是这些。尽管我们和她的族人相处得不错，但我还没到能坦然说出口的地步，比如‘嘿，丽贝卡，你觉得你和你的族人能帮我们偷一台 PlayStation、几款游戏、几个手柄，哦，还有避孕套，这样我和我男朋友就能做爱了！’你好好想想，真嗣。”

I feel myself glow red at her words. I'm still not quite used to talking about that or putting it in terms like that. It's not that I don't enjoy us doing… that I just, I don't know talking about it makes me nervous. She is right though, we probably couldn't say anything to imply we were doing that to them. A few eyebrows were raised when we said we were sharing a room but Fuyutsuki managed to salvage that by saying that we lived together when Misato was here. It was best for us. I think only he and Rebecca knows that we're a couple and even then I don't think that's approve if they knew we were doing that sort of thing.  
听到她的话，我感到自己的脸红了起来。我仍然不太习惯谈论这些，或者用这样的措辞。并不是我不享受我们做……只是，我不知道，谈论这些让我紧张。不过她是对的，我们大概不能向他们暗示我们在做那种事。当我们说我们共住一间房时，已经有人皱起了眉头，但冬月先生设法挽救了局面，说我们在美里在这里时就已经同居了。这对我们来说是最好的。我想只有他和丽贝卡知道我们是情侣，即便如此，我也不认为他们会赞同我们做那种事。

I'm for once thankful Misato isn't here, she'd probably see right through us. She'd probably kill us or tease us and celebrate us being a couple by trying to do something for us, like cook for us which would in turn likely kill us. Either way I'm sure we'd die.  
我这次倒是庆幸美里不在这里，她大概一眼就能看穿我们。她可能会杀了我们，或者取笑我们，然后为了庆祝我们成为一对而试图为我们做些什么，比如做饭，结果很可能会把我们毒死。不管怎样，我确信我们都会死。

"You're right…" “你说得对……”

"Of course I am, besides its good that we get out of that place on our own for a while. For the past two weeks we've been getting surrounded by more and more people. So a bit of time to ourselves is good."  
“当然对了，而且能暂时自己离开那个地方一会儿也挺好的。过去两周我们周围的人越来越多。所以能有点自己的时间挺好的。”

"Yeah I know what you mean."  
"是啊，我明白你的意思。"

I find it strange speaking those words considering just two weeks ago we were in that exact situation and we both longed for more people to return. Now they have done we're talking about how nice it is to be alone. I suppose that's one of the strange things about being human, you always manage to contradict yourself.  
说这些话让我觉得奇怪，毕竟两周前我们还在那种境地，都盼望着更多人能回来。现在他们真的回来了，我们却在谈论独处的惬意。我想这就是做人的奇妙之处，你总能自相矛盾。

"How many people have returned now?"  
"现在回来了多少人？"

"They've picked up another twenty in the past week so that brings us to around fifty so far. We're starting to see that place come to life, Fuyutsuki is enjoying himself as the chief doctor in there. Other people are volunteering for different roles, a few hobbyist gardeners have taken up residence in the lower levels starting to grow things for us. We even have the cafeteria staff manning the restaurant."  
"过去一周他们又接收了二十人，这样一来我们总共大约有五十人了。我们开始看到那个地方焕发生机，作为首席医生的冬月正享受着他的工作。其他人也在志愿担任不同的角色，一些爱好园艺的人在下层安家，开始为我们种植作物。我们甚至有食堂员工在经营餐厅。"

I shoot her a curious glance, "The cafeteria staff?"  
我好奇地看了她一眼，“食堂员工？”

"Yeah for some reason they refused to evacuate when the order was given. They wanted to ensure the people who helped to save the world didn't go without a good meal. If that was the case they probably should have evacuated."  
“是啊，出于某种原因，他们在下达疏散命令时拒绝撤离。他们想确保那些拯救世界的人不会没有一顿好饭吃。如果是那样的话，他们或许应该撤离。”

We laugh at her joke and continue through the aisles making our way back out towards the car. Asuka takes some of the stronger bags from the front of the store and starts to put a few of the items in there.  
我们被她的笑话逗乐，继续穿过货架，向着停车场的方向走去。明日香从商店前台拿起一些较重的袋子，开始往里面放几样物品。

"You know one day we'll have to start bringing the ones we've already taken back with us. The whole point of these things is you get one and re-use it. We just keep on getting them and leaving them behind."  
“你知道吗，总有一天我们得开始把已经拿过的袋子带回来。这些袋子的意义就在于你拿一个，然后重复使用。我们只是一直在拿新的，然后把旧的留在原地。”

She shrugs, "Not my fault you keep forgetting, besides you never know when you might need a few spare bags."  
她耸耸肩，“这可不是我的错，谁让你总是忘记呢，再说了，你永远不知道什么时候会需要几个备用袋子。”

"I think we have about twenty…"  
"我想我们大约有二十个……"

"Well we're prepared aren't we?"  
"好吧，我们准备好了，不是吗？"

I don't even dare to ask what we'd need to be prepared for that'd involve twenty reusable bags so I instead just load the stuff into the back of the car. Asuka quickly dives in and grabs the console and clutches it tightly as she gets into the front passenger seat of the car. I guess that means I'm driving.  
我甚至不敢问我们需要准备什么，以至于要用到二十个可重复使用的袋子，所以我只是把东西装进车的后备箱。明日香迅速钻进车内，抓住控制台并紧紧握住，然后坐到了副驾驶座上。我想这意味着我得开车了。

I'm just glad to see her happy. When we returned I was terrified that we'd be the only ones and that we'd have to survive all alone. I was scared of her about what she would do to me for all I have done and I was scared she'd abandon me. Yet it didn't happen. For six weeks we were together on our own. Making each other feel better and finally getting over those issues that separated us. We finally found some happiness that we needed. It was just as my mother had said.  
我只是很高兴看到她快乐。当我们回来时，我害怕我们会是唯一的幸存者，必须独自生存。我害怕她会因为我所做的一切对我做什么，也害怕她会抛弃我。然而这一切都没有发生。六周以来，我们独自在一起，互相安慰，最终克服了那些将我们分开的难题。我们终于找到了我们需要的幸福。正如我母亲所说。

We made that apartment and this world our own little paradise despite all the desolation. It was like my mother had said, anywhere can be paradise as long as you have the will to live. I understand those words now.  
尽管四周荒凉，我们还是把那间公寓和这个世界变成了我们的小天堂。就像我母亲说的，只要有活下去的意志，任何地方都可以是天堂。我现在明白了这些话的含义。

Fuyutsuki finally got to give me and Shinji those medical exams he had wanted to give us when he first came back. Thankfully the bite marks on Shinji' shouldn't weren't noticeable and he wanted nothing more than a quick look at us and a blood test. It turns out there is nothing wrong with us and exposure to this atmosphere has caused no problems at all. I knew that'd be the case but I have to admit I was a little bit nervous that something might be wrong.  
终于，冬月可以给我们和真嗣做他想在我们刚回来时做的体检了。幸运的是，真嗣身上的咬痕并不明显，他只想快速检查我们并做个血液测试。结果显示我们一切正常，暴露在这种环境中也没有造成任何问题。我知道会是这样，但我不得不承认，我有点紧张，担心会有什么问题。

Our group has grown yet again to around eighty or so people now. We actually have an administration section now managing people records. It's been calm though, any potential animosity has been quelled by Rebecca and her group which has grown in size as well. A few JSSDF members who had returned and when they learned the truth decided to join them. NERV security also decided to as well. I guess that makes sense, it's not like NERV is a thing anymore.  
我们的团队再次壮大，现在大约有八十人左右。我们现在甚至有了一个管理人事的行政部门。虽然一直很平静，但任何潜在的敌意都被丽贝卡和她日益壮大的团队平息了。一些返回的日本自卫队成员在得知真相后也决定加入他们。NERV 的安保人员也做出了同样的选择。我想这很合理，毕竟 NERV 已经不复存在了。

The only thing I dislike is that as the group expands I get left out of the loop. I know Shinji doesn't mind being out of the loop, he's happy to just spend his time with me or even helping out in one of the kitchens but I don't like it. I want to know what is happening but they're keeping me in the dark. If there hasn't been any news from the outside world or if there is a problem they probably think it's for the best but they don't understand my need to know. They don't, they can't understand what me and Shinji went through and they can't understand my need to protect him and keep him safe and that starts with me knowing as much as I can.  
唯一让我不满的是，随着团队的扩张，我被排除在了信息圈之外。我知道真嗣并不介意被边缘化，他很高兴能和我一起度过时光，或者在厨房帮忙，但我并不喜欢这样。我想知道正在发生什么，但他们却对我保密。如果没有外界的消息，或者有什么问题，他们可能认为这是最好的选择，但他们不理解我需要知道的原因。他们无法理解我和真嗣经历过的那些事，也无法理解我保护他、确保他安全的决心，而这首先需要我尽可能多地了解情况。

I realize just now how hypocritical that must seem. I'm demanding to know the truth, thinking I deserve to know all because I have this aim of dissecting it for the bad parts to hide from Shinji so he doesn't get hurt. I just, don't want to worry him he's been through enough and as for me… I can handle it.  
我此刻才意识到那看起来有多虚伪。我要求知道真相，自以为有权了解一切，只因我怀揣着剖析它、找出坏处并隐瞒真嗣的意图，以免他受到伤害。我只是不想让他担心，他已经经历了太多，至于我……我能应付。

No one is really sure why but ever since Fuyutsuki returned and Rebecca's people arrived it seems to have opened the floodgates for others to return. It's been four weeks since he returned and in that time we've had over a hundred people return. According to Fuyutsuki there were probably around one hundred and fifty in the area at the time of Third Impact including the JSSDF troops so if this carries on we'll eventually have everyone. Except for those who wish to remain behind.  
没人真正确定原因，但从副司令回来了，丽贝卡的人也到了之后，似乎为其他人打开了回归的大门。他回来已经四周了，这段时间里我们已经有超过一百人返回。据副司令说，第三次冲击时该地区大约有一百五十人，包括自卫队成员，所以如果这种情况持续下去，我们最终会迎来所有人。除了那些选择留在原地的人。

Fuyutsuki makes an effort to talk to us whenever he can. He tries to tell us what he is able to about the people who return. He has told us that no one seems to remember what happened during their time in the sea, they don't remember deciding to come back nor do they remember being part of everyone else's consciousness. Fuyutsuki himself said he doesn't remember it but it seems to be a pattern with the others that have followed. It looks like myself and Asuka are the only ones who can remember what happened during that process.  
每次有机会，冬月都会尽力与我们交流。他试图告诉我们那些归来者的情况，他说没有人记得在海中经历的时光，他们不记得自己决定回来的那一刻，也不记得曾是其他人意识的一部分。冬月自己也表示他不记得，但这似乎是其他归来者的共同模式。看起来，我和明日香是唯一能记住那个过程中发生事情的人。

The more people that return the more I begin to wonder if any of them will return. I don't know how to feel about some of them. I don't not want them to return but I'm conflicted on how I'll feel if all but one ended up returning or if just one of them came back. I wonder what it really takes for them to come back. For me and Asuka it seemed so simple is it more difficult for the others? Is it because they're older? They have deeper desires than we did? Do they just not want to come back?  
随着越来越多的人归来，我开始怀疑是否还会有人回来。我不知道该如何面对他们。我并非不希望他们回来，但我对如果几乎所有人都回来了，或者只有一个人回来时我会作何感想感到矛盾。我想知道他们回来的真正条件是什么。对于我和明日香来说，这似乎很简单，对其他人来说会更难吗？是因为他们年纪更大吗？他们的欲望比我们更深吗？还是他们根本就不想回来？

When I came back I put up nine markers, Asuka has already kicked hers down when she came back so that means eight are left. Fuyutsuki has seen the markers but he left his standing. He said it represented the man he used to be, not the one he wants to be moving forward. One of the markers is for Rei. I don't know if she will return to us. I don't know if she can. She became Lilith and the other Ayanami's were destroyed by Dr Akagi. What about her soul though? Won't that be out there somewhere, can that not just manifest itself? I tried asking Fuyutsuki and he told me he didn't know. He said that when it comes to Rei, Lilith, Adam and the Evangelions that humans were playing with things they shouldn't have been playing with. We were entering a domain we never had a right to enter.  
当我回来时，我立起了九个标记，明日香回来时已经踢倒了她的，所以现在还剩下八个。冬月看到了这些标记，但他没有动自己的。他说那代表过去的他，而不是他希望成为的未来。其中一个标记是给丽的。我不知道她是否会回到我们身边。我不知道她是否能回来。她变成了莉莉丝，而其他绫波们被赤木博士摧毁了。但她的灵魂呢？难道不会在某处存在，不能自行显现吗？我曾试图问冬月，他告诉我他也不知道。他说，涉及到丽、莉莉丝、亚当和 EVA 时，人类在玩弄本不该触碰的东西。我们闯入了一个本无权进入的领域。

I guess I'd just like the chance to see her again properly. Not that I understand what she is and how she helped me. I'd like to thank her and welcome her as the only family I really have.  
我想我只是希望能有机会再次好好见到她。不是说我理解她是什么，以及她如何帮助了我。我想感谢她，并欢迎她成为我真正唯一的家人。

That is aside from Misato, that's the one I look for first. It's the one Asuka looks out for first as well. We keep on looking out for a sign of her red jacket and purple hair but she hasn't shown up yet. I wonder if she ever will or if she can. At first I wondered if it was because she died before it all started but plenty of people who came back died before she did. So why hasn't she came back yet? Does she just not want to?  
除了美里，她是我最先寻找的那个。也是明日香最先留意的。我们一直在寻找她红色夹克和紫色头发的踪迹，但她至今未曾出现。我不知道她是否会出现，是否能够出现。起初我怀疑是因为她在一切开始前就去世了，但许多比她晚去世的人都已经回来了。那么她为什么还没回来呢？是她不想回来吗？

I don't think I'll ever see my father again. Asuka once asked me what I'd do if I did see him again and all I told her was that we won't see him again. I'm certain of that and I don't know if this is bad but I can't feel anything about that man. I don't feel sad that I won't see him. I guess it's because he got what he wanted and he no longer has to be afraid of me anymore. He can live in those constructed worlds not having to fear me because he'll have my mother there. He's ran away while I'm still here moving forward.  
我想我再也见不到我的父亲了。明日香曾问我，如果真的再见到他会怎样，我告诉她我们不会再见到他了。我对此确信无疑，虽然不知道这是否不好，但我对那个男人没有任何感觉。我不会因为见不到他而感到悲伤。我想这是因为他已经得到了他想要的，不再需要害怕我了。他可以在那些构建的世界中生活，不再畏惧我，因为他会有我的母亲在身边。他逃离了，而我仍在这里继续前行。

I told Asuka about that, that the reason my father did what he did was to see my mother again. The reason he had no contact with me was because he was so frightened of hurting me he just pushed me away. She got angry and called him a coward and several other words in a mixture of Japanese and German that might have raised a few eyebrows if anyone was around to hear them. She actually apologized for getting angry afterwards realizing that despite what he did the man was still my father.  
我告诉了明日香，我父亲之所以那样做，是为了能再次见到我母亲。他不与我联系的原因，是因为他太害怕伤害我，所以才把我推开。她生气了，骂他是懦夫，还混杂着日语和德语说了好几个词，要是有旁人在场听到，可能会皱起眉头。事后她其实为发火道歉了，意识到尽管他做了那些事，那人终究还是我父亲。

That much is true, Gendo Ikari is still my father but I agree with Asuka. He was all those things she called him and he was a coward. If he wasn't then he'd be here right now trying to make things right, begging for some form of forgiveness but he won't return. I'm alright with that. I don't need him in my life anymore, I don't need his approval and I don't need his fear.  
这一点没错，碇源堂依然是我父亲，但我同意明日香的说法。他就是她所说的那些，是个懦夫。如果他不是，那他现在就会在这里试图弥补，恳求某种宽恕，但他不会回来。我对此无所谓。我不再需要他出现在我的生活中，不需要他的认可，也不需要他的恐惧。

Despite all this I'm still trying to fight that small piece of me that wants his approval. It wants him to say well done and show he is proud of me. A small part of me that no matter how angry I am with him, how much I try to kid myself I don't care focuses on gaining his words of kindness. It is only a small part but it can be loud and it can hit at anytime. Maybe what I said before about not feeling anything about him wasn't true. That small part of me does feel something and I can't get rid of it. Maybe that is a good thing.  
尽管如此，我仍在努力对抗内心深处渴望他认可的那一小部分。它希望他能说声做得好，表现出为我感到骄傲。无论我对他有多愤怒，无论我如何自欺欺人地不在乎，那一小部分始终专注于赢得他的温言软语。虽然只是微小的一部分，但它可能很响亮，且随时可能袭来。或许我之前所说的对他毫无感觉并不真实。那一小部分确实有所感触，我无法摆脱它。也许这是件好事。

It was not my father me and Asuka were looking out for today though, as usual it was Misato. As the bus brought the few people back to the shelter she was of course not to be seen. Aside from Fuyutsuki none of the people we knew have been found.  
然而，今天我们关注的并非我的父亲，一如既往，是美里。当公交车将寥寥数人带回避难所时，她自然不见踪影。除了冬月之外，我们认识的人无一被找到。

We turn around and go back into the shelter lobby. Asuka calls for the elevator as I wonder why no one else has come back yet.  
我们转身回到避难所大厅。明日香呼叫电梯，我则在想为什么其他人还没回来。

"Asuka... do you think this is my fault?"  
"明日香...你觉得这是我的错吗？"

I can see her roll her eyes, "What are you talking about?"  
我看到她翻了个白眼，“你在说什么呢？”

"All of the people we knew... Misato, Akagi, the bridge team none of them have come back yet. I was wondering if, well I was wondering if maybe it was my fault they hadn't. Maybe something I had done had stopped them..."  
"我们认识的所有人...美里、赤木、还有那些桥上的队员们，他们一个都没回来。我在想，嗯，我在想是不是因为我，他们才没能回来。或许我做了什么，阻止了他们..."

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"I don't know..." "我不知道..."

She leans against the wall of the elevator as it begins its journey down.  
她靠在电梯壁上，随着电梯开始下行。

"Did you state any conditions that certain people couldn't return?"  
"你有没有设定某些人不能回来的条件？"

"Well... no I didn't..." "嗯... 不，我没有..."

"Well then how can it be your fault they haven't returned?"  
"那既然如此，怎么会是你的错他们还没回来呢？"

"Yeah I know, you're right."  
"是啊，我知道，你说得对。"

She grabs my hand and leads me off into the corridor towards our room, "Of course I am."  
她抓住我的手，带我穿过走廊走向我们的房间，“当然，我愿意。”

As soon as we enter the room she pins me up against the wall and kisses me firmly. She immediately starts to unbutton my shirt as I return the kiss and run my hand along her side. I shudder slightly as her hands meet my chest. She drags her nails down my chest and over my stomach stopping just slightly above the button on my jeans.  
我们一进房间，她就把我按在墙上，坚定地吻了我。她立刻开始解我的衬衫扣子，我回吻着，手沿着她的侧身游走。当她的手触到我的胸膛时，我微微颤抖。她用指甲从我的胸口划过，沿着腹部向下，停在牛仔裤的扣子上方。

I slide my hand up her shirt and all along her body as I turn her around and pin her up against the wall. I pull away from her kiss as she smiles at me knowingly. She finishes removing my shirt as I remove her. My hands move to her bra and within moments we're both stood topless. We continue to kiss, our tongues meeting and exploring each other's mouth. My hands focus on her body, I make her gasp as one hand runs along her breast. I moan into her mouth as she slides a hand into my jeans.  
我把手滑进她的衬衫，沿着她的身体向上，同时把她转过来按在墙上。我离开她的吻，她带着了然的微笑看着我。她脱掉我的衬衫，我也脱掉了她的。我的手移到她的胸罩上，很快我们就都赤裸上身了。我们继续接吻，舌头相遇并探索着对方的口腔。我的手专注于她的身体，当一只手抚过她的乳房时，她倒吸一口气。她把手滑进我的牛仔裤时，我在她嘴里呻吟。

I pull away from her and lead her towards the bed. She pushes me down and mounts me and leans in softly biting my shoulder. As we look away our eyes meet, her eyes full of desire and I'm sure mine are too.  
我挣脱她的怀抱，牵着她走向床边。她将我推倒，跨坐在我身上，轻柔地咬住我的肩膀。当我们目光移开时，眼神交汇，她的眼中满是渴望，我确信我的也是。

We're about to go further when a loud beeping is heard from the corner of the room. She sits up and pulls away from me.  
我们正要更进一步时，房间角落传来一阵刺耳的哔哔声。她坐起身，从我身边抽离。

"Urgh, just as we were getting to the good bit. What the hell could they want?"  
“呃，就在精彩部分即将开始的时候。他们到底想要什么？”

I contemplate telling her to ignore it, that we could just pretend we didn't hear it. It could be important though. She climbs off of me and picks up the receiver.  
我考虑告诉她别理会，我们可以假装没听到。但这可能很重要。她从我身上下来，拿起听筒。

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

I watch as her expression changes, "I thought you guys brought all of them in…"  
我看着她的表情变化，“我以为你们把他们都带回来了…”

Another pause as she listens to the person on the other end. I shoot her a look of concern as I wonder what is happening, "Yeah… we'll be there immediately."  
她又停顿了一下，听着电话那头的人说话。我担忧地看着她，不知道发生了什么，“好的…我们马上过去。”

She puts down the receiver and goes to collect her clothes from the floor.  
她放下电话，去地板上捡起自己的衣服。

"Looks like we're going to have to put our little bit of fun on hold for now."  
“看来我们的小乐子得暂时搁置了。”

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

"They found someone else just now, someone we know and want us to be there when they bring them in. So put your shirt back on and make sure you're presentable."  
“他们刚刚找到了另一个人，是我们认识的，希望我们到场迎接。所以把衬衫穿好，确保自己看起来得体。”

She walks over to me winks and kisses me on the lips, "My delicious perverted Shinji."  
她朝我走来，眨了眨眼，在我唇上轻轻一吻，“我的美味变态真嗣。”

---

As we ride the elevator up to the surface me and Shinji can't keep our hands off of each other. He keeps on touching me, running his hand along my backside and kissing my neck. I'm just as bad doing the same to him. Damnit why did they interrupt us just before we were about to start. This is the worst feeling ever.  
当我们乘坐电梯上升到地面时，我和真嗣都无法控制自己的手，他不停地触碰我，用手抚摸我的背部，亲吻我的脖子。我也同样对他做着同样的事情。该死，为什么他们就在我们即将开始之前打断我们。这真是最糟糕的感觉。

Even worse is the tension I feel knowing who is on their way back. I haven't told Shinji who it is yet. I don't know if he has guessed at all, he seems far more interested in my body. I push him away as we reach the surface and the door begins to open.  
更糟糕的是，我知道谁正在回来的路上，我还没告诉真嗣是谁。我不知道他是否已经猜到了，他似乎对我身体的兴趣更大。当电梯到达地面，门开始打开时，我推开了他。

"You're adventurous today Shinji, don't worry we'll resume when we get back."  
"今天你真大胆啊，真嗣，别担心，我们回来后会继续的。"

We exit the elevator and walk out into the evening. Unlike the other times when they bring people back there is no group to welcome this person back. I feel Shinjis arms around me.  
我们走出电梯，步入夜晚。与以往他们带人回来时不同，这次没有一群人来迎接。我感觉到真嗣的手臂环绕着我。

"Did… they say who it was?"  
"他们……有说那是谁吗？"

"No. Just someone we knew."  
"不，只是我们认识的某个人。"

I hate lying to him but I have a reason, I want to see his reaction when this person does return. I want to see the joy on his face.  
我讨厌对他撒谎，但我有理由，我想看看这个人回来时他的反应。我想看到他脸上的喜悦。

"I see… so it could be any of them."  
"我明白了……所以可能是他们中的任何一个。"

"Yup." "是啊。"

I look down the road and see the silhouette of a vehicle moving towards us. That must be Rebecca back with our special guest. I release myself from Shinjis grasp and turn towards him.  
我沿着道路望去，看见一辆车的轮廓正向我们驶来。那一定是丽带着我们的特别嘉宾回来了。我挣脱了真嗣的握持，转身面对他。

"We'll have to do a little bit of acting for a moment, don't want to scare this person back into Instrumentality."  
“我们得稍微演一下戏，别把这人吓回唯物主义去了。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

The vehicle comes closer eventually coming to a stop in front of us. I can see her already. Her purple hair, her red jacket and her eyes darting all around the landscape taking in this new world. I can hear Shinji behind me, he's seen her as well now.  
车辆逐渐靠近，最终在我们面前停下。我已经能看到她了。她那紫色的头发，红色的夹克，还有她四处打量的眼睛，正贪婪地吸收着这个新世界的景象。我能听到真嗣在我身后，他也已经看到了她。

"Misato…" "美里…"

I realize I'm smiling as she steps out of the car and looks towards the two of us. She looks stunned as her eyes dart back and forth between us. I can see her lip tremble as she struggles to speak.  
当她从车里走出来，朝我们俩看过来时，我意识到自己在微笑。她的目光在我们之间来回游移，显得十分震惊。我看到她的嘴唇颤抖着，努力想说些什么。

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

She darts past me straight towards Shinji pulling him into a hug that almost crushes him. She finally came back, the little family has finally been reunited.  
她径直从我身边冲向真嗣，紧紧地抱住他，几乎让他喘不过气来。她终于回来了，这个小家庭终于团聚了。

"Oh my god, you're… alive. I can't believe it, I… Shinji… you…"  
"哦，我的天，你还…活着。我简直不敢相信，我…真嗣…你…"

I watch as the two of them embrace, tears flowing freely down the faces of the two of them. Shinji can barely speak.  
我看着他们紧紧相拥，泪水从两人的脸颊上自由流淌。真嗣几乎说不出话来。

"Misato… you came back…" "美里…你回来了…"

"I know… I'm sorry it took so long. They said it's been ten weeks since everything happened. I'm so sorry Shinji, I didn't know… I didn't know what was happening."  
"我知道……对不起，花了这么久时间。他们说，自从一切发生以来已经过去十周了。真对不起，真嗣，我不知道……我不知道发生了什么。"

She kneels down and the two of them continue to hug one another and I continue to watch. I'm happy for him. Shinji is happy and Misato is happy, like I said the little family is reunited. I'm so happy I can see the burning of tears behind my eyes. I look at the two of them, the guardian and her adopted son. She's holding him so tightly and he's so very happy.  
她跪了下来，两人继续拥抱彼此，而我继续旁观。我为他感到高兴。真嗣很开心，美里也很开心，就像我说的，这个小家庭重聚了。我太高兴了，以至于眼眶都泛起了泪光。我看着他们俩，守护者和她的养子。她紧紧地抱着他，而他如此幸福。

I guess… he has what he needs now. He's happy but what am I? I realize that I'm not a part of this happiness, I'm not a part of this family. I have no right to be. I was horrible to Misato, I was horrible to Shinji. I made a promise to protect Shinji and help him. I love him but now. Misato is back and she can protect him more than I can. We have this home now. Where does this leave me?  
我想……他现在拥有了所需的一切。他很快乐，但我呢？我意识到，我并不属于这份幸福，我不属于这个家庭。我没有权利参与。我对美里很糟糕，对真嗣也很糟糕。我曾承诺保护真嗣并帮助他。我爱他，但现在。美里回来了，她能比我更好地保护他。我们现在有了这个家。那我该何去何从？

I'm still watching the two of them realizing that the tears in my eyes aren't from happiness. It's because I feel like I'm about to lose my purpose. Without saying a word I turn around and walk towards our car. I take the keys out of my jacket pocket and I enter leaving them to their embrace.  
我依旧注视着他们，意识到眼中的泪水并非源于喜悦。那是因为我感到自己即将失去存在的意义。我一言不发地转身，走向我们的车。从夹克口袋里掏出钥匙，进入车内，留下他们相拥的身影。

---

Misato nearly knocks me off of my feet as she runs towards me and holds onto me tightly. It isn't long before I'm crying. All I can do is stutter out her name as I wrap my arms around her and bury my head into her shoulder. She finally came back, I've been hoping for this moment for ten weeks. Watching for a sign of her, looking out with every group that returned for a sign of that red jacket and purple hair.  
美里几乎将我撞倒，她向我奔来，紧紧抱住我。不久，我也开始哭泣。我只能结结巴巴地喊出她的名字，双臂环绕着她，将头埋进她的肩头。她终于回来了，这十周以来，我一直期盼着这一刻。每当有人群归来，我都会寻找她的踪迹，寻找那件红色夹克和紫色头发的迹象。

I was so worried that she wouldn't return. I was so worried that she would stay in there or wouldn't even be able to return. I was so worried I had lost her forever. I never had a chance to apologize to her, I never had a chance to thank her for taking me in and being the closest thing to a parent anyone has been for ten years.  
我曾如此担心她不会回来。我担心她会留在那里，或是根本无法回来。我担心我永远失去了她。我从未有机会向她道歉，从未有机会感谢她收留我，十年来，她是我最接近父母的存在。

I pull away from her wiping my eyes and smile widely. I can still barely speak and as our tear stained eyes meet I realize neither can she. I step away and quickly reach behind my neck and unclip the necklace, her necklace that I've been wearing every day since I came back.  
我抽身离开，擦了擦眼睛，露出灿烂的笑容。我仍然几乎说不出话来，当我们的泪眼相望时，我意识到她也一样。我后退一步，迅速伸手到颈后解开项链，那条自从我回来后每天都佩戴的她的项链。

I still can't say anything but I hold it out to her and she looks at me in amazement.  
我还是说不出话，但我把它递给她，她惊讶地看着我。

"You… you kept it." “你……你一直留着它。”

All I can do is nod, if I speak I'm just going to break down and cry again.  
我只能点头，如果开口，我只会再次崩溃哭泣。

"Shinji I… I… thank you…"  
“真嗣，我……我……谢谢你……”

She takes the necklace off me and fixes it around her neck. It's going to be strange not wearing that cross around me but it was only mine until she returned. Asuka always questioned why I wore it when I could have just left it behind. It was a stupid reason, I thought that if I wore it maybe Misato would feel that somewhere. Maybe she'd know that we were thinking of her and wanted her back.  
她从我身上取下项链，戴在了自己的脖子上。不再佩戴那枚十字架对我来说会很奇怪，但它本就属于她，直到她回来之前才暂时归我所有。明日香总是质疑我为何要戴着它，明明可以留在原地。那是个愚蠢的理由，我以为如果我戴着它，也许美里会在某个地方感受到。也许她会知道我们在想念她，希望她回来。

"Misato I… I… I'm… sorry about what happened… about how I was… I… it was because of me you… and…"  
"美里，我……我……我……对不起发生的事……关于我当时的样子……我……都是因为我你……还有……"

I can't speak all I can do is cry as the memories of what happened ten weeks ago come flooding back to the surface. It's still so clear in my mind. Even though I seemed so out of it I can remember every word that was said. I can remember each and every moment of it. I can remember every scream from above and below. I can still remember what I did to Asuka and what happened to her in that fight. I know she forgave me and she tells me what every time I tell her about it. She tells me she forgives me and she holds me. Just like when I know she is having a nightmare or when she asks me what she has done to deserve any ones love I hold her.  
我无法言语，只能哭泣，因为十周前发生的记忆再次涌上心头。一切在我脑海中依然如此清晰。尽管我当时看似恍惚，但我记得每一句话。我记得每一个瞬间。我记得每一声来自上方和下方的尖叫。我仍然记得我对明日香所做的一切以及她在那场战斗中遭遇的事。我知道她原谅了我，每次我向她提起，她都会告诉我她原谅了我，并紧紧拥抱我。就像我知道她正在做噩梦或当她问我做了什么值得任何人的爱时，我拥抱她一样。

Misato pulls me towards her again and holds me tightly. She whispers softly into my ear.  
美里再次将我拉向她，紧紧抱住我。她在我耳边轻声细语。

"Shinji… it doesn't matter now. I'm alive, you're alive. We're lived through it, we survived and we came back. That's all that matters. What you did in the past was the past, how you were then… I… I know I was hard on you and I'm sorry but we have to move forward. Both you and Asuka."  
"真嗣…现在这些都不重要了。我还活着，你也活着。我们经历了一切，幸存了下来，并且回来了。这才是最重要的。你过去的所作所为已经过去，你当时是怎样的…我…我知道我对你很严厉，我很抱歉，但我们要向前看。你和明日香都是。"

I nod knowing that she is right. That's exactly what me and Asuka have done since we came back. We moved on, we forgave each other for whatever the other did. We allowed ourselves to admit the love we felt for each other and it felt good.  
我点头，知道她说得对。这正是我和明日香回来后所做的。我们向前看，原谅了对方所做的一切。我们允许自己承认对彼此的爱，这种感觉很好。

Misato can't see it but I grin slightly. She won't know about me and Asuka yet, I can't wait for her to find out. I can't wait to see her face when she finds out the two of us finally admitted we liked each other. Asuka told me that Misato probably knew all that time, that was probably why she kept on encouraging us to do things together. I look around and notice an empty spot where Asuka was previously standing.  
美里看不见，但我微微一笑。她还不知道我和明日香的事，我迫不及待想让她知道。我迫不及待想看到她发现我们俩终于承认喜欢对方时的表情。明日香告诉我，美里可能早就知道了，这可能就是她一直鼓励我们一起做事的原因。我环顾四周，注意到明日香之前站的地方现在空了。

"So Shinji… where is Asuka? Don't tell me she thinks she can escape this as well."  
"那么，真嗣…明日香在哪里？别告诉我她也想逃避这一切。"

My heart sinks instantly as I see no trace of Asuka anywhere. I look at where she was standing and look in the direction of where we last parked the car. It's gone. Asuka has gone. Shit.  
我的心立刻沉了下去，因为我四处都找不到明日香的踪影。我望向她刚才站立的地方，又看向我们最后一次停车的地方。车不见了。明日香走了。该死。

"Misato… we… she had, I have to go…"  
"美里…我们…她已经，我必须去找她…"

I start to move back to the shelter to get the keys to one of the other automatics but Misato pulls me back a concerned look in her eyes.  
我开始往避难所走去，想拿另一把自动武器的钥匙，但 Misato 拉住了我，眼中满是关切。

"Shinji, what's going on?"  
“真嗣，发生什么事了？”

I don't know how to explain this to her. I know exactly what has happened, I understand Asuka more than I used to. I know what has happened. Misato came straight to me, she saw how happy we were and it scared her. I know it did and I know exactly where she went. I suppress the urge to call her and idiot out loud. I know where Asuka will have gone but I don't know how to explain this to Misato.  
我不知道该怎么向她解释。我清楚地知道发生了什么，我对明日香的了解比以前更深了。我知道发生了什么。Misato 直接来找我，她看到我们那么开心，这让她害怕了。我知道她害怕，也知道她去了哪里。我强忍着大声叫她白痴的冲动。我知道明日香会去哪里，但我不晓得如何向 Misato 解释这一切。

"She… me and her… I'll explain on the way…"  
"她…我和她…我边走边解释…"

---

What the hell did I do that for? I throw myself down on the couch in the old apartment and question exactly why I did that. What the hell was I so scared of? Did I not expect the re-union of Shinji and Misato to be like that? I'm such and idiot.  
我到底是为了什么才那样做？我瘫坐在旧公寓的沙发上，反复问自己为什么要那样做。我到底在害怕什么？难道我没预料到真嗣和美里重逢会是那样吗？我真是个白痴。

I'm coming to the realization that I've probably done it again. A few moments after I ran off they'll both realize I'm not there. Shinji will get worried about me and upset. He'll probably blame himself for me doing this. Misato will question it and probably think I'm a petulant bitch for running off. Just what the hell am I? Why do I have to be like this?  
我渐渐意识到，自己可能又搞砸了。我跑开后不久，他们俩就会发现我不见了。真嗣会为我担心，感到难过。他可能会自责，认为是他导致了这一切。美里则会对此感到疑惑，或许会认为我是个任性的婊子，就这么跑掉了。我到底算什么？为什么我非得这样不可？

I've been good lately, I've not been angry. I've not been upset. I've listened to him, I've tried to talk about my problems and I've admitted I need him in my life. That I need other people and being alone isn't the way to be for me. Yet I saw that there, I saw that bond they had and I just… it scared me. Was it because I thought I wouldn't get that from Misato? That the motherly bond she has with Shinji isn't what she has with me?  
最近我状态不错，没有生气，也没有难过。我听他说话，尝试谈论我的问题，并承认我需要他在我的生活中。我需要其他人，独自一人并不适合我。然而，我看到了那一幕，看到了他们之间的纽带，我只是……这让我害怕。是因为我觉得我无法从美里那里得到那样的母爱吗？她与真嗣之间的母子情深，与我不同吗？

I was always an outsider in their world. I forced my way into Misato's care claiming it'd be useful for me to live with the captain and that as two women we would bond. I actually said that! What a load of crap, the reason I wanted to be there is because I was fucking terrified of being alone. From day one I longed for closeness from them but I made up excuses whenever it came close to get away from it. So I remained an outsider in their world. Even with all that I know she cares for me, I know she visited me every day in that hospital and I know she blames herself for what I tried to do to myself.  
我一直是他们世界的外人。我强行进入美里的照顾下，声称与队长同住对我有用，而且作为两个女人我们会建立联系。我居然真的这么说了！真是胡说八道，我想要在那里是因为我他妈的害怕孤独。从第一天起，我就渴望他们的亲近，但每当接近时，我总是找借口逃避。所以我仍然是他们世界的外人。尽管我知道她关心我，我知道她每天都会来医院看我，我知道她为我想自杀的事自责。

God I'm so fucking stupid.  
天啊，我真他妈的蠢。

Yet knowing this I can't bring myself to go back. Not yet anyway, I can't go back like this. I can't admit to them what I did. No I'll… make an excuse I'll break into the supermarket or something and get Misato a present. I'll say that's what I was doing, I ran off to get her a present!  
尽管如此，我还是无法让自己回去。至少现在不行，我不能就这样回去。我无法向他们承认我所做的事。不，我会……找个借口，我会闯进超市或者别的什么地方，给美里买个礼物。我会说那就是我跑出去的原因，我去给她买礼物了！

Shinji will see right through me. For all I call him an idiot I know he isn't and even if he was, he knows me and what I'm like. I'll have to explain this to him won't I? Or maybe I'll just, no that won't work. He's stubborn, he probably wouldn't let me do that to him until I had explained myself.  
真嗣一眼就能看穿我。尽管我总叫他傻瓜，我知道他不是，而且即使他是，他也了解我，知道我是什么样的人。我得向他解释这一切，对吧？或者也许我可以，不，那行不通。他很固执，他可能不会让我这么做，直到我解释清楚。

I'll just wait here for a little bit longer though. Make sure I know what I'm going to say. I should probably think about what to get Misato as a gift too. Beer! She likes beer, that'd be good and I'll get her something else. At least I won't have to worry about them turni-  
不过，我会在这里再等一会儿。确保我知道该说什么。我也应该考虑一下给美里买什么礼物。啤酒！她喜欢啤酒，那会很好，我还会给她买别的。至少我不必担心他们会转过身来——

I hear a door closing outside the apartment and my heart skips several beats. He came after me, the idiot actually pursued me. All of those times in the past when I wanted nothing more than for him to do something like that. When I wanted him to cross my ridiculous 'Wall Of Jericho', when I wanted him to hold me when we kissed, when I would have loved for him to have ducked under the security tape and held me after my mind got destroyed he did nothing. This though, the one time I was hoping he wouldn't he actually followed me. A smile spreads across my lips at the sheer ridiculousness of it, I guess I have to explain myself to both of them now. I guess it's what I deserve. Damnit I love you Shinji.  
我听到公寓外有门关闭的声音，心跳不由得漏了几拍。他追来了，这个傻瓜真的追来了。过去那些时候，我多么希望他能有所行动，希望他能跨越我那荒唐的‘耶利哥之墙’，希望我们接吻时他能抱紧我，希望在我精神崩溃后他能不顾安全胶带抱住我，他什么都没做。然而现在，唯一一次我希望他不要来，他却真的跟来了。我忍不住笑了起来，这实在太荒谬了，我想我现在得向他们俩解释清楚了。也许这是我应得的。该死，我真爱你，真嗣。

I leave the apartment and go down the stairs just in time to see him rounding the corner of the building. He looks angry but on seeing me he throws himself at me.  
我离开公寓，下楼时正好看到他绕过建筑物的拐角。他看起来很生气，但一看到我，就扑了过来。

"Asuka you…" “明日香，你……”

"Yeah yeah I know…" "是是，我知道……"

"I was worried…" "我很担心……"

"No you weren't, you knew exactly where I had gone and you knew why, didn't you?"  
"不，你没担心，你明明知道我去哪儿了，也知道为什么，对吧？"

He pulls away from me, "Yeah I did."  
他离开我，"嗯，我做了。"

A sigh leaves my lips as I lean against the wall.  
我靠在墙上，叹了口气。

"I'm sorry I just… I saw you and Misato and I thought… I thought Shinji has his family now. There is nothing I can give you now and I got scared. The great Asuka Langley Sohryu got scared because of something so stupid."  
"对不起，我只是……我看到你和美里，我想……我想真嗣现在有他的家人了。我现在没有什么可以给你的，我害怕了。伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷因为这么愚蠢的事情害怕了。"

"It isn't stupid it…" "这并不愚蠢，它……"

"It is stupid and don't let me think it isn't! Don't let my mistakes slip past you Shinji, I know what I did! I ran away because of something silly, because I thought there was no purpose for me in your life. When that's not true because…"  
"它是愚蠢的，别让我以为它不是！别让我的错误从你眼前溜走，真嗣，我知道我做了什么！我逃跑是因为一些可笑的事，因为我以为我在你生活中没有存在的意义。但那不是真的，因为……"

"Because I love you Asuka."  
"因为我爱你，明日香。"

"Exactly." "确实。"

"I love you so much Asuka and I don't want you to be hurt or feel like that. I'm sorry."  
"我非常爱你，明日香，我不想让你受伤或感到那样。对不起。"

"Oh for god's sake why are you apologizing? You really do make this feeling bad thing difficult."  
"哦，看在上帝的份上，你为什么要道歉？你真的让这种感觉糟糕的事情变得困难。"

"Sorry!" “对不起！”

"Oh forget it, we should probably just go. What did you tell her?"  
"哦，算了吧，我们可能还是走吧。你跟她说了什么？"

Shinji shakes his head, "Nothing. I said you had probably left something important here from when we were here earlier."  
真嗣摇摇头，“没什么。我说你可能把之前我们在这儿时留下的重要东西落下了。”

"You lied to her? For me?"  
“你对她撒谎了？为了我？”

He nods, "I… I'd do anything for you Asuka."  
他点头，“我……我愿意为你做任何事，明日香。”

"You idiot." “你这个傻瓜。”

I pull him closely towards me and kiss him softly. As he pulls away I whisper to him, "We'll resume what we were doing earlier when we get back if you want."  
我紧紧地把他拉向我，轻轻地吻了他。当他离开时，我轻声对他说，“如果你想的话，我们回去后可以继续之前在做的事情。”

He blushes and nods as I lean in and kiss him again. This time we kiss for longer, so long in fact I'm unaware of the third person standing near to us with a look of shock and amusement on her face. She coughs.  
他脸红着点头，我再次倾身吻他。这次我们吻得更久，久到我都没注意到第三个人站在我们旁边，脸上带着震惊和好笑的表情。她咳嗽了一声。

"I'm not interrupting something am I?"  
“我没打扰到什么吧？”

Both of us jump and I hit my head on the wall pulling away from the kiss. Shinji blushes immediately as we both look in horror at Misato.  
我们俩都吓了一跳，我离开吻时头撞到了墙上。真嗣立刻脸红了，我们俩惊恐地看着美里。

"Mi-Misato… it isn't what it looks like… well it is and… we were going to… but we- and you and…"  
"美-美里…这不是你看到的那样…呃，确实是那样，而且…我们本来打算…但是我们-还有你和…"

I smirk, "What Shinji is trying to say is, we were going to tell you later but someone was a bit of an idiot before we got the chance to and ran off."  
我微微一笑，"碇真嗣想说的是，我们本来打算晚点告诉你的，但有人之前有点傻，没等我们有机会就跑掉了。"

"You two are… since when?"  
"你们俩…从什么时候开始的？"

"I don't know, maybe two weeks or so after we returned. We didn't really ask each other out formerly, it just kinda happened."  
"我不知道，大概是我们回来后的两周左右吧。我们并没有正式地约对方出去，事情就这么自然而然地发生了。"

I look back towards Shinjis smiling face, the smile I fell in love with so long ago. I no longer feel stupid for what I did. I feel relieved in a way, I might have suggested it but the idea of formally announcing we were together to Misato always seemed a bit strange. Her finding out like this seems much more fitting.  
我回头看向新治的笑脸，那个我很久以前就爱上的笑容。我不再为我所做的事感到愚蠢。在某种程度上，我感到释然，虽然是我提议的，但正式向美里宣布我们在一起的想法总是有些奇怪。她以这种方式发现，似乎更加合适。"

She steps forward, "I'm really happy for you both but we should probably get ba-"  
她走上前，“我真为你们俩高兴，但我们可能该回——”"

Her words are cut off by a loud crack ringing through the night. I suddenly feel something heavy against me and realize Shinji has suddenly lurched forward. With horror I turn to see a faint line of blood trickling from his mouth. Just at that moment I feel something warm and wet on my hand. I move it into view not sure I want to see it. Not sure that I want to confirm it.  
她的声音被夜晚中一声响亮的断裂声打断。我突然感到有什么沉重的东西压在我身上，意识到真嗣突然向前倾倒。惊恐中我转头看到他嘴角渗出一丝血迹。就在那一刻，我感觉手上有些温热湿润的东西。我将其移到视线中，不确定自己是否想看到。不确定是否想确认这一点。

The world seems to move in slow motion as I look and see the blood covering my hand. My limbs go weak as Shinjis body falls to the ground lifelessly. I'm sure I can hear Misato screaming as I just stand there with a blank expression on my face, my mouth opening slowly but nothing coming out.  
世界似乎在慢动作中移动，当我看到手上沾满鲜血时。我的四肢变得无力，真嗣的身体无力地倒在地上。我确信我能听到美里在尖叫，而我只是站在那里，脸上毫无表情，嘴巴慢慢张开却什么也说不出来。

Slowly I sink to my knees still holding my hand out like it's some kind of grotesque offering. Misato rushed up next to Shinji, at least I think she is. I can hear another voice in the street now. Another woman, she is next to me shaking me by the shoulder and screaming my name. They pick me up and try to move me but all I can do is stumble forward and vomit onto the pavement. Another shot rings out and then there is a bright light followed by darkness.  
我慢慢地跪下，仍然伸出手，仿佛在做出某种怪异的献祭。美里冲到真嗣身边，至少我认为是她。我听到街道上另一个声音。另一个女人，她在我身边摇晃着我的肩膀，尖叫着我的名字。她们把我扶起来试图移动我，但我所能做的只是踉跄前行，在人行道上呕吐。又一声枪响，然后是一道强光，接着是一片黑暗。

### Chapter 12 Splitting Of The Breast
**To the bird's it meant… that supper was ready…  
对鸟儿来说，这意味着……晚餐已经准备好了……**

For a moment I feel an immense pain in my chest, I see her tear stained face slip away from me as I fade into darkness. A moment later the pain subsides and I'm vaguely aware of a presence. Something I've felt before, a warm comforting presence all around me. I open my eyes and I see the orange liquid all around me, LCL. The presence… I know what it is.  
有那么一刻，我感到胸口剧痛无比，看着她泪痕斑斑的脸庞从我眼前消失，我逐渐陷入黑暗。片刻后，疼痛减轻，我隐约感觉到一种存在。这是种我曾感受过的温暖而慰藉的存在，弥漫四周。我睁开眼睛，看到橙色的液体环绕着我，是 LCL。那种存在……我知道它是什么。

_'Mother…' '母亲…'_

Something feels so familiar about this. The LCL is cloudy around me, the place I'm in is so very cold. I feel weak and I'm struggling to breathe, I'm struggling to keep my eyes open. Why do I feel like I've experienced this before, why does this feel so familiar? What is happening to me?  
这里的一切让我感到如此熟悉。LCL 在我周围显得浑浊，我所处的地方异常寒冷。我感到虚弱，呼吸困难，努力保持眼睛睁开。为何我觉得这一切似曾相识，为何这种感觉如此熟悉？我到底发生了什么？

My eyes are growing heavier, someone help me. Asuka… Misato… Mother? Please… help… me…  
我的眼皮越来越沉，谁来帮帮我。明日香…美里…妈妈？请…救救…我…

**And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue…  
然后是宝贝你好，你的守护之眼如此湛蓝…**

I open my eyes again, all the pain from before has gone. Instead I can see a bright light straight ahead of me. My eyes slowly adjust to it and I see it's a single light attached to the ceiling. A familiar ceiling. My eyes adjust some more followed by my other senses, I'm now aware of a low hum of a machine. I turn my head to the left and I see a few things. The machine monitoring my vitals, a plant and a screen.  
我再次睁开眼睛，之前的疼痛已消失无踪。取而代之的是眼前明亮的光芒。我的眼睛慢慢适应了它，发现那是天花板上的一盏灯。熟悉的天花板。我的眼睛进一步适应，其他感官也随之恢复，我听到了机器的低沉嗡鸣。我向左转头，看到了几样东西。监测我生命体征的机器，一盆植物和一个屏幕。

I turn my head to the left. If I had the strength to I'd jump back in shock but all I can do is widen my eyes as I see Rei Ayanami sat next to me. She doesn't seem to have noticed I'm awake yet, her attention is drawn to the book she is reading. I feel my stomach drop, what the hell is going on here. Why is Rei Ayanami sat next to me, where is Misato? Where is Asuka?  
我向左转过头。如果我有足够的力气，我会惊得跳起来，但现在我只能瞪大眼睛，看着绫波零坐在我旁边。她似乎还没注意到我已经醒了，她的注意力全在她正在读的书上。我感到胃部一阵下沉，这到底是怎么回事。为什么绫波零会坐在我旁边，美里呢？明日香又在哪里？

"You are awake." “你醒了。”

"I… I am?" “我……我醒了？”

I'm not sure why I asked it like a question, everything feels so foggy to me. I don't know what's happened to me. Am I dreaming?  
我不确定为什么我会像提问一样说出来，一切都对我来说如此模糊。我不知道发生了什么。我是在做梦吗？

"Ay-Ayanami, what are you doing here?"  
“绫波，你在这里做什么？”

She looks me over curiously, or is it curiosity? Maybe I've offended her by asking the question. I always found it hard to know what Ayanami was thinking. I want to quickly correct myself, to make her understand what I meant by asking. I don't really know what to say to her though, I know who Ayanami is, I know what she is and after I learned that I didn't know how to handle her. The last thing I saw of her was what she became on Third Impact.  
她好奇地打量着我，还是说那是好奇？也许我问这个问题冒犯了她。我一直觉得很难猜透绫波在想什么。我想迅速纠正自己，让她明白我问的意思。但我真的不知道该对她说什么，我知道绫波是谁，我知道她是什么，自从我知道这些后，我就不知道该如何面对她。我最后看到她是在第三次冲击时她变成的样子。

"I thought you would like to see someone when you woke up."  
"我以为你醒来时会想见到某个人。"

The answer catches me off guard, pulling me from my thoughts. She was expressing concern for me? I suppose she would, we always misread Rei a lot of the time. We always thought she was cold and emotionless. Asuka especially but Rei never understood, she never had anyone to guide her. My father's fault of course. He brought Rei up for a purpose, not to be a human.  
这个回答让我措手不及，将我从思绪中拉回。她在表达对我的关心？我想她会的，我们总是误解丽很多次。我们总以为她冷漠无情。尤其是明日香，但丽从未理解过，她从未有人引导。当然，这是我父亲的错。他抚养丽是为了一个目的，而不是让她成为一个真正的人。

"Oh I see… thank you."  
"哦，我明白了…谢谢你。"

"I will inform the others that you are awake."  
"我会通知其他人你醒了。"

She points towards a tray, "They left that for you a short while ago, would you like me to bring it over to you?"  
她指向一个托盘，“他们不久前给你留了这个，需要我帮你拿过来吗？”

I look at the tray and I can smell the food, in immediate response my stomach growls and I nod. "Yeah thank you."  
我看着托盘，闻到了食物的香味，我的肚子立刻咕噜作响，我点头道：“好的，谢谢。”

"Is there anything else you would like?"  
"还有其他需要的东西吗？"

I shake my head as I also shift myself into a sitting position and she hands me the tray.  
我摇摇头，同时自己也坐起身来，她递给我托盘。

"No, thank you I'll be alright."  
"不了，谢谢，我会没事的。"

"Well that's good for you."  
“那对你来说是好事。”

Without any more words she turns and leaves the room. As she opens the door I see a flash of red quickly pull away from the door. I laugh a little realizing it's Asuka, she's been waiting outside the room all this time.  
她没再多说什么，转身离开了房间。当她打开门时，我瞥见一抹红色迅速从门边移开。我轻笑一声，意识到那是明日香，她一直等在门外。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

I'm sure I can hear a sigh from outside the room but after a few moments she enters the room. She stops partway into the room and looks at me and folds her arms. Clearly in response to the shocked expression on my face.  
我确信能听到门外传来一声叹息，但过了一会儿，她走进了房间。她走到一半停下，看着我，双臂交叉。显然是对我脸上震惊的表情做出的反应。

"What? Do I have something on my face?"  
"什么？我脸上有什么东西吗？"

"You… you're wearing your school uniform?"  
"你……你穿着校服？"

She looks down at the uniform she is wearing and then back to me, she looks at the uniform again, "Well observed Shinji, that's because that's where we go in the morning. Not that I should have to considering we just had to fight an Angel."  
她低头看了看自己身上的校服，然后又看向我，再次确认校服，"“真嗣，观察得不错，那是因为我们早上要去学校。不过考虑到我们刚刚才和使徒战斗过，我本不该穿的。”

Fight an Angel? Go to school? What is she talking about? I'm so confused, I don't know what is happening here. Asuka… isn't greeting me as she would. Is it because other people are here?  
与天使战斗？去上学？她在说什么？我完全糊涂了，不知道这里发生了什么。明日香……没有像往常那样跟我打招呼。是因为有其他人在场吗？

"What… happened to me?" “我……发生了什么事？”

"Well that's what I'd like to know, just what the hell did you think you were playing at rushing forward like that? You didn't give me and Wondergirl a chance to get into position! You… you idiot!"  
“我也很想知道，你到底以为自己在干什么，那样冲上去？你没给我们和奇迹女孩进入位置的机会！你……你这个白痴！”

"I… I-" "我…我-"

I don't know what to say to her, rushing forward? Not giving them a chance to get into position? I don't understand. In the end all I can do is muster my usual response in situations like this.  
我不知道该对她说什么，冲上前去？不给他们机会站好位置？我不明白。最终，我能做的只是在这种情况下的惯常回应。

"I'm sorry…" "我很抱歉…"

"Yeah well next time just leave it to the professional here!"  
"哎，下次就交给这里的专业人士吧！"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

I drop my head and sniff as I feel tears forming. I just don't understand what's going on here. Why was Ayanami here? Why is Asuka talking to me like this? What has happened, it's almost as if I've woken up somewhere else. I wipe my eye but Asuka has clearly noticed I'm trying to not cry. She drops the expression of anger, even if slightly.  
我低下头，吸了吸鼻子，感觉泪水在形成。我就是不明白这里发生了什么。为什么绫波在这里？为什么明日香这样跟我说话？发生了什么，这几乎就像我醒来在另一个地方一样。我擦了擦眼睛，但明日香显然注意到我试图不哭。她放下了愤怒的表情，尽管只是稍微。

"Urgh, no need to get upset about it. I thought you were supposed to be a man! I'm just saying this to you because I know Misato won't."  
"呃，没必要为此难过。我以为你应该是个男人！我这样对你说是因为我知道美里不会。"

I try to respond but a new voice interrupts us, "What's going on here?"  
我试图回应，但一个新声音打断了我们，“这里发生了什么？”

I look up and I see Dr Akagi has entered the room now with Misato behind her. Dr Akagi is looking at Asuka with a menacing scowl.  
我抬头一看，发现赤城博士现在和美里一起进入了房间。赤城博士正带着威胁的表情看着明日香。

"Asuka, Shinji needs to rest can you please leave."  
“明日香，真嗣需要休息，请你离开。”

She looks around, "Yeah, whatever. Invincible Shinji needs to be told how amazing he is. I'm heading home."  
她环顾四周，“哼，随你怎么说。无敌的真嗣需要被提醒自己有多厉害。我要回家了。”

I want to say something, to try to ask her what's going on to try to ask anyone what's going on but all I can do is look down at the plate of food in front of me. Suddenly I don't feel quite as hungry as I was a few moments ago. Asuka turns and storms out of the room leaving me in there with Ritsuko and Misato.  
我想说些什么，试图问她发生了什么，试图问任何人发生了什么，但我只能低头看着面前的盘子。突然间，我不再像几分钟前那样感到饥饿。明日香转身冲出房间，留下我和律子、美里在里面。

"Misato… what happened… I don't…"  
“美里……发生了什么……我不明白……”

Misato rushes over to my side and shushes me, "It's alright Shinji, just relax you had an incident in the Eva but its fine now."  
美里急忙跑到我身边，轻声安抚我：“没事的，真嗣，放松点，你在 Eva 里出了点状况，但现在一切都好了。”

An incident in the Eva? This isn't right, I don't remember any of this. The last thing I remember was being in that street with Asuka, we had kissed and Misato caught us. Asuka said something to me and then I remember pain.  
Eva 里的事故？这不对劲，我一点印象都没有。我记得的最后一件事是和明日香在那条街上，我们接吻了，然后被美里撞见。明日香对我说了些什么，接着我就感到了疼痛。

"You mean… I was in the Eva before this? Why? I don't remember?"  
“你是说……在这之前我就已经在 Eva 里了？为什么？我不记得了？”

It's Ritsuko who shoots me a curious glance now, "You were fighting the Twelfth Angel. You were pulled inside it, do you mean to say you don't remember?"  
是律子现在投来好奇的目光，“你在与第十二使徒战斗。你被拉进去了，你是想说你不记得了吗？”

She looks at Misato, "Maybe we should keep him longer, it might be worth lo-"  
她看向美里，“也许我们应该让他多留一会儿，这可能值得——”

Before she can finish the sentence I cut in, "No! I remember… it's just, it… feels like I was in there for a lot longer than I was… I'll be alright. When can I go home?"  
在她能说完这句话之前我打断道，“不！我记得……只是，它……感觉我在里面待的时间比实际的要长……我会没事的。我什么时候能回家？”

She looks at Misato and then back to me, "Felt like you were in there for longer? Interesting… Shinji if you're feeling up to it I'd like to ask you some questions about anything you saw in there."  
她看了看美里，然后又转向我，“感觉你在里面待了很久吗？有意思……真嗣，如果你感觉还好，我想问你一些关于你在里面看到的东西的问题。”

I look at Misato who immediately asks the question for me, "What do you mean talk to him? We already confirmed there was no contamination, he's healthy! To answer your question Shinji we can leave as soon as you're done eating. Would you like that?"  
我看向美里，她立刻替我问出了口，“你说的和他谈谈是什么意思？我们已经确认没有污染，他很健康！回答你的问题，真嗣，我们一吃完就可以离开。你喜欢这样吗？”

I nod, "Yeah I would… thank you."  
我点头，“是的，我喜欢……谢谢你。”

There is a definite air of tension between the two of them. Misato keeps on glaring at Ritsuko with a look of pure hatred. I know exactly why. Ritsuko's plan while I was trapped in this Angel was to drop N2 mines in there, defeating the Angel was all that mattered and not the pilot's life. I push the plate of food away at the thought. She really was willing to let me die wasn't she?  
他们两人之间明显弥漫着紧张的气氛。美里一直用充满仇恨的眼神瞪着律子。我完全明白为什么。律子在我被困在这个使徒体内的计划是投放 N2 地雷，击败使徒才是唯一重要的事，而不是驾驶员的生命。想到这里，我把盘子里的食物推开。她真的愿意让我去死，不是吗？

I don't understand this though, all of this has already happened. I've already lived through this so why am I here again?  
我不明白这一点，所有这些都已经发生了。我已经经历过这一切，那为什么我又回到了这里？

Ritsuko, "It's his choice Misato, and it's nothing to do with contamination it's just… that Angel posed some very interesting theoretical questions. If Shinji saw anything while he was inside it's possible he was pulled into a pocket Universe. Up until now everything we know about the Dirac Sea is theoretical, he could have experienced an entire lifetime in the twelve hours he was in there. The rules of regular time and space could have gone completely out of the window. It'd be interesting to see what we can learn, of course it is up to Shinji."  
律子说：“这是他的选择，美里，这与污染无关，只是……那个使徒提出了一些非常有趣的理论问题。如果真嗣在里面看到了什么，他可能被拉入了一个口袋宇宙。到目前为止，我们对狄拉克海的了解都是理论上的，他在里面的十二个小时里可能经历了一生。常规时间和空间的规则可能完全失效了。看看我们能学到什么会很有趣，当然这取决于真嗣。”

I look up taking in what she has said, I don't really understand all of it but she said something interesting. I could have experienced a whole lifetime while I was in there. I don't really want to talk to her though, at least not yet. What I want to do is go home, if this is where I am now and if that is what has happened to me I just want to go home. I want to talk to Asuka, I want to make her not angry at me. In fact I know exactly what I'll do.  
我抬头消化她所说的话，虽然并非全部理解，但她提到了一些有趣的事情。我在那里可能经历了一生。不过，我并不太想和她交谈，至少现在不想。我只想回家，如果这里是我现在的所在，如果这一切真的发生在我身上，我只想回家。我想和明日香谈谈，我想让她不再生我的气。事实上，我知道我该怎么做。

"I'll… think about it Ritsuko, I'd like to go home and rest first though."  
“我会……考虑一下的，律子，但我现在想先回家休息。”

**Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright…  
在花园里，月亮似乎格外明亮……**

I finished my food as quickly as I could and Misato got me out of the hospital as soon as we could. As we exit the hospital and go towards the car I can't help but hide my shock at the sight in front of me. The familiar NERV Pyramid that I haven't seen for over ten weeks and above me the Geofront and sunken buildings of Tokyo-3.  
我尽可能快地吃完了饭，美里也尽快带我离开了医院。当我们走出医院，走向汽车时，我忍不住掩饰自己对眼前景象的震惊。那熟悉的 NERV 金字塔，我已经十多周未曾见过了，而头顶上是地底都市和沉没的东京-3 建筑。

Misato looks across at me, "I thought you would have gotten over the shock of seeing the Geofront by now Shinji."  
美里转头看着我，"我以为你现在已经习惯了看到地底都市，真嗣。"

I brush it off and smile, "No I just… I had some weird dreams when I was in there it's just… nice to see it again I guess."  
我轻描淡写地笑了笑，"不，我只是……在里面的时候做了些奇怪的梦，只是……再次看到它感觉很好，我想。"

I wonder exactly how long it has been for me. The twelfth Angel attacked in October, and what I just experienced happened in the middle of March. That's almost five months I experienced. I take a deep breathe to calm myself down. I can't let anyone know something is wrong, I can't let anyone figure this out until I figure it out.  
我好奇到底已经过去多久了。第十二使徒是在十月袭击的，而我刚刚经历的事情发生在三月中旬。这几乎有五个月的时间。我深呼吸试图让自己冷静下来。我不能让任何人察觉到有什么不对劲，在我自己弄清楚之前，不能让任何人发现。

The air is nice, there is a gentle breeze even here in the Geofront. It's just enough to bring a nice coolness to the warmth.  
空气很清新，即便在 Geofront 这里也有微风轻拂。恰到好处地为温暖带来一丝凉爽。

I get into the front seat of the car and put on my seatbelt. Misato enters as well, did this happen last time? I can't remember. Was that last time or was it something I saw while I was in the Angel? This is real, it feels real at least. The food tasted real, if not a little bit bland, Misatos hug felt real, I had to use the bathroom and that felt real. As we pull away and start back towards the city I look across, there is something I have to say to Misato.  
我坐进车的前排并系好安全带。美里也上了车，上次也发生过这种情况吗？我不记得了。那是上次还是我在使徒中看到的情景？这感觉很真实，至少感觉上是这样。食物尝起来很真实，虽然有点淡，美里的拥抱感觉很真实，我确实需要上厕所，那种感觉也很真实。当我们驶离并开始返回城市时，我转头看向美里，有些话我必须对她说。

"Misato… I'm sorry for the trouble I caused."  
"美里…对不起，给你添麻烦了。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"With the Angel… I, shouldn't have done what I did?"  
"对那个使徒…我，不该那么做的吗？"

I hear a sigh escape her lips, "Is this because of what Asuka said? I swear that girl can be mean sometime, I told her to not say anything to you. Look you're alive and that's all that mat-"  
我听到她叹了口气，"“这是不是因为明日香说了什么？我发誓那女孩有时真的很刻薄，我告诉她不要对你说任何话。看，你还活着，这才是最重要的……”

"No it isn't, please... I… Asuka was right. I was an idiot, I went off ahead without thinking about the others and I was arrogant. I nearly messed it up for everyone and put their lives at risk… she is right to be mad at me…"  
"不，不是这样的，请……我……明日香说得对。我是个傻瓜，没考虑其他人就擅自行动，还自以为是。我差点搞砸了一切，让大家陷入危险……她生我的气是应该的……"

Another sigh, "I know and I do have to file a report on your behaviour during it. Questions will be asked but I was hoping to keep you away from all of that though. Shinji you nearly died and by the sounds of it something bad happened to you while you were in there so I think that's punishment enough for you. Now if you'd like I could always have you do something at NERV like shadow Ritsuko and help with her paperwork or something. God knows I can't think of anything else to punish you, you already do all the chores around the apartment…"  
又是一声叹息，“我知道，我确实得就你在事件中的行为写份报告。会有问题被提出，但我本希望让你远离这一切。真嗣，你差点丧命，听上去你在里面还遭遇了些糟糕的事，我觉得这对你来说已经算是足够的惩罚了。现在，如果你愿意，我可以安排你在 NERV 做些事情，比如跟着律子帮忙处理文书工作之类的。天知道我还能想出什么别的惩罚方式，你已经把公寓里的杂活都包揽了……”

I actually laugh, "Yeah… I suppose I do."  
我忍不住笑了，“是啊……我想也是。”

"I'll talk to Ritsuko about it if you really want some sort of punishment but you shouldn't feel bad about it. Asuka will calm down eventually and the questions that'll be asked… well they'll go away too."  
"如果你真的想要某种惩罚，我会和律子谈谈，但你不必为此感到难过。明日香最终会冷静下来，那些问题也会随之消失。"

All I do is nod and think about what I'll do next. I've already gotten that apology off my chest. Last time I didn't do that, last time it didn't fully dawn on me the stupidity of what I did. I was arrogant because I learned I had beaten Asuka and Rei in the sync test. It was the one time I really got confident and cocky in my Eva and it nearly cost me. It doesn't suit me to be like that.  
我只是点头，思考着下一步该做什么。我已经把道歉说出口了。上次我没有这么做，上次我还没完全意识到自己行为的愚蠢。我因为得知自己在同步测试中击败了明日香和丽而变得自大。那是我唯一一次在 Eva 中真正感到自信和自负，差点让我付出代价。那种样子不适合我。

Now I have to make it up to Asuka. I already know how I'm going to do that. I'm not just going to let her calm down. I'm going to apologize properly to her. I'm actually going to talk to her properly and not run away. I don't know if the Asuka here will match the one I saw whilst in there. Maybe I'm wrong but I have to try.  
现在我必须弥补对明日香的伤害。我已经知道该怎么做了。我不会只是让她冷静下来。我要正式向她道歉。我要真正地和她好好谈谈，不再逃避。我不知道这里的明日香是否和我当时看到的那个一样。也许我错了，但我必须尝试。

"Misato can we stop off somewhere before we go home?"  
"美里，我们回家前能先去个地方吗？"

"Already thinking that myself Shinji, going to get some things for us to celebrate defeating another Angel and your return!"  
"我也在这么想，真嗣。我们要买点东西庆祝打败另一个使徒和你回来！"

"Well actually I was thinking… there is a record shop in town… could we maybe stop there first?"  
"其实我在想……镇上有家唱片店……我们能不能先去那里看看？"

"Yeah of course, just tell me where it is."  
“当然可以，告诉我它在哪儿就行。”

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

**And it's, hey babe, your suppers waiting for you…  
“然后就是，嘿宝贝，你的晚餐在等你呢……”**

Misato pulls into a space on the side of the road as I grab my wallet out of my pocket. I look across to her and speak.  
美里把车停在了路边的一个车位上，我则从口袋里掏出钱包。我转头看向她，开口说道。

"I'll be a couple of minutes okay?"  
"我一会儿就好，可以吗？"

"Yeah no problem, take your time."  
"没问题，你慢慢来。"

I get out and quickly enter the store and upon getting inside I immediately question if this is the right thing to do. I know what I want to get but is it the right thing to do, I keep on questioning my reality. What my brain might have conjured, what the Angel might have conjured and what was real. The music Asuka listens to, what was mine or the Angels invention? No, it can't be now that I think about it. I recognise some of it because I had heard it coming from her music player before. So she must like it.  
我下了车，快步走进店里，一进门就立刻怀疑自己是否在做正确的事。我知道自己想买什么，但这是否是正确的选择，我不断质疑自己的现实。我的大脑可能想象了什么，天使可能想象了什么，以及什么是真实的。明日香听的音乐，是我的还是天使的创造？不，现在想来应该不是。我认出其中一些是因为之前从她的音乐播放器里听到过。所以她一定喜欢。

I must have been stood there for some time because one of the assistants walks over to meand asks me if I'm alright.  
我一定在那里站了很久，因为一位店员朝我走来，问我是否还好。

"Fine, thanks." “还好，谢谢。”

I quickly make my way over to the CDs and hope they have in what I'm looking for. Within a moment I find the section for 'G' and I look through until I see the large box. Exactly what I was looking for, a deluxe edition of _'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway',_ the entire album along with a bonus disc full of interviews about the making of it and a booklet talking about the process of making it and featuring a gallery from the live performance of the album.  
我迅速走向 CD 区，希望他们有我想要的东西。很快我就找到了标有‘G’的部分，浏览了一会儿就看到了那个大盒子。正是我想要的，《The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway》的豪华版，不仅包含整张专辑，还有一张附赠的访谈光盘，内容关于专辑的制作过程，以及一本介绍制作过程并收录了现场表演照片的小册子。

I take it over to the counter and quickly flash my NERV ID at the assistant which gets me some money off of it. After paying for it I make my way back to Misato.  
我把东西拿到柜台，迅速向店员出示了 NERV 的身份证，这让我享受了一些折扣。付款后，我便返回了美里那里。

"Considering you were in the hospital just an hour ago you seem to be in a good mood, did you get what you wanted?"  
“考虑到你一小时前还在医院，你现在看起来心情不错，是得到了你想要的吗？”

I nod, "Exactly what I wanted."  
我点头，“正是我想要的。”

She looks over the box in my hand, "Oh, I didn't think that would be your sort of thing."  
她瞥了一眼我手中的盒子，“哦，我没想到你会喜欢这种东西。”

I shake my head, "It isn't for me. It's a present for Asuka."  
我摇摇头，“不是给我的。这是给明日香的礼物。”

She starts the car but what I've said causes her to immediately brake from the shock, "A… present?"  
她启动了汽车，但我刚才的话让她震惊到立刻刹车，“一…礼物？”

"Yeah, I… wanted to get her something to make up for what happened and well… it doesn't matter let's just go."  
"是啊，我……想给她买点东西弥补一下发生的事，不过……没关系，我们走吧。"

I realize I've already revealed too much information about how I feel for Asuka. I shouldn't have said anything about it being for her, I should have just made an excuse. Misato didn't know what sort of music I listened to but I felt it'd be right for her to know for some reason.  
我意识到自己已经透露了太多关于我对明日香感情的信息。我不该提到这是给她的，我应该找个借口。虽然美里不知道我喜欢什么类型的音乐，但不知为何，我觉得让她知道是正确的。

"I knew it." "我就知道。"

"Knew what?" "知道什么？"

"That you liked her, this is so cute, Shinji's first crush! Well if you want any advice, you know exactly where to go."  
"知道你喜欢她啊，真可爱，真嗣的初恋！好吧，如果你想听点建议，你知道该去哪儿找。"

I look out the window so she can't see me blush, she's just going to tease me about this all the way back. Unless…  
我望向窗外，不让她看到我脸红，她肯定会一直拿这事取笑我回去的。除非……

"Yeah, I know Mr Kaji is really friendly."  
“是啊，我知道梶先生真的很友好。”

That was a mistake, I work up merely hours ago and now I'm going to die. In her anger the car swerve and I can feel her eyes burning a hole through me. She waits a moment before spitting out a reply.  
那是个错误，我仅仅几小时前才醒来，现在我就要死了。她愤怒中车子摇摆，我能感觉到她的目光像是要把我烧穿。她等了一会儿才吐出回答。

"Hmph, you know… you can be really… salty at times."  
“哼，你知道吗……你有时候真的……挺刻薄的。”

It's hard to not laugh at the comment, I remember her saying something similar to me when we first met. She'll probably find a way to get at me later but I don't mind. I clutch the CD in my hand thinking about Asuka all the rest of the way home.  
看到这条评论很难不笑出声，我记得我们初次见面时她也对我说过类似的话。她可能会找机会回敬我，但我并不介意。我紧握着手中的 CD，一路上满脑子都是明日香。

**I've been so far from here  
我曾离这里如此遥远**

"We're home." “我们到家了。”

Misato shouts through the hallway but there is no reply, I spot a pair of shoes on the floor belonging to Asuka. They've been kicked off, I bend down to arrange them neatly before removing my own shoes. Misato laughs at my gesture.  
美里在走廊里大喊，但没有回应，我注意到地板上有一双属于明日香的鞋子。它们被踢掉了，我弯下腰把它们整齐地摆好，然后脱下自己的鞋子。美里对我的举动笑了。

"Been back barely thirty seconds and already cleaning up the place, you don't have to do that you know?"  
“回来还不到三十秒就开始收拾地方，你不必这么做的，你知道吧？”

I nod, "I know that but…"  
我点头，“我知道，但是……”

I don't really have a reason, it was just instinctual to do that. If I didn't Asuka would probably complain tomorrow morning before school that it was a miss. I smile again at that thought, the two of us going to school in the morning. We'll be walking their together, taking the train together and walking through those gates together and seeing all our friends. I'm even looking forward to hearing about life before Second Impact.  
我其实没有特别的原因，只是本能驱使我那样做。如果我不做，明日香大概会在明早上学前抱怨错过了什么。想到这里，我又笑了，想象着我们俩一起上学的情景。我们会一起走那条路，一起乘电车，一起穿过校门，见到所有的朋友。我甚至期待着听他们讲述第二次冲击前的生活。

Yet there is still so much I don't really understand. I don't understand what happened to me in that Angel. Ritsuko pulled me to one side before we left, she explained in less scientific terms what had happened to me. She said she still wanted to speak to me but I told her I had seen certain things. I didn't tell her the full story about it. I couldn't tell her the full story, what exactly was I going to say? That I experienced nearly half a year of my life, that I experienced the end of the world and that I fell in love?  
然而，仍有许多我不太明白的事情。我不明白在那只使徒中我经历了什么。离开前，律子把我拉到一旁，用不那么科学的语言解释了发生在我身上的事。她说还想和我谈谈，但我告诉她我看到了一些东西。我没有告诉她全部的故事。我无法告诉她全部的故事，我到底该怎么说呢？说我经历了近半年的生活，体验了世界的终结，还坠入了爱河？

I still don't understand it though, why did the Angel show me those things? Ritsuko thinks that it was trying to communicate with me, that maybe the Angels were trying to understand humans on some level. Was that what it was trying to do, understand me? I don't even understand myself so how can anything else? I go into the front room and see it completely empty, I can hear Asuka in her room listening to music. I can't really make out what it is but I look down at the present I have for her again hoping I'm doing the right thing.  
我还是不明白，为什么天使要给我看那些东西？律子认为那是在试图与我沟通，也许天使们在某种程度上试图理解人类。它是在试图理解我吗？我连自己都不理解，其他事物又怎么可能理解我呢？我走进客厅，发现里面空无一人，我能听到明日香在她的房间里听音乐。我听不清是什么音乐，但我再次看向给她的礼物，希望我没有做错。

From the kitchen I can hear Misato talking to someone on the phone.  
从厨房里，我能听到美里在电话里和某人交谈。

"What? Yeah, he's out of the hospital now! Asuka? She's here too, in her room…"  
“什么？是啊，他已经出院了！明日香？她也在，就在她的房间里……”

There is a pause, "What tonight? I don't know…"  
一阵沉默，“今晚什么事儿？我不清楚……”

Another pause, I can only assume it's Kaji, "Yeah alright, I can come over if it's really that important. This better not be one of your tricks though."  
又是一阵停顿，我猜是加持，“好吧，如果真那么重要，我可以过来。不过你最好别耍什么花招。”

She hangs up the phone and comes out of the kitchen, "Shinji… I'm sorry but I have to go out to a meeting. I don't know when I'll be back but I'll leave you and Asuka money to get food."  
她挂断电话，从厨房走出来，“真嗣……对不起，我得出去开个会。不知道什么时候回来，但我会留钱给你和明日香买吃的。”

I nod, "Misato… it's alright. I know that was Kaji."  
我点头，“美里…没事的。我知道那是加持。”

I smile reassuringly at her, "You do? That obvious huh?"  
我向她露出安心的微笑，“你知道？这么明显啊？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

She eyes the CD in my hand, "Well I suppose it'll at least give you and Asuka some privacy when you spring your surprise on her. Don't stay up too late and…"  
她瞥了一眼我手中的 CD，“嗯，我想至少能让你和明日香有点私人空间，当你给她惊喜时。别熬夜太晚，还有…”

She winks at me, "Be careful Shinji, we don't want a little Ikari-Sohryu running around just yet."  
她对我眨了眨眼，“小心点，真嗣，我们可不想这么快就有个小真嗣-惣流满地跑。”

I feel the blood rush to my cheeks instantly at her wink and comment, "Misato!"  
她的眨眼和评论让我瞬间脸红，“美里！”

"Just kidding, have fun!"  
“开个玩笑，玩得开心！”

She doesn't give me a chance to respond before she puts her shoes back on and ducks out of the apartment. I now find myself standing in front of Asuka's bedroom door. In one hand I'm holding the present I got her and my other hand is clenching and unclenching. Suddenly I don't feel quite as brave or as confident as I had done.  
她没给我回应的机会，就重新穿上鞋子，匆匆离开了公寓。现在我发现自己站在明日香的卧室门前。一只手拿着我给她买的礼物，另一只手则紧握又松开。突然间，我不再觉得自己像之前那样勇敢或自信了。

I think back to my experience whilst I was trapped in the Angel. What I was shown and what I lived through. I actually wonder how much of it was true. I saw so much happen in there, I saw what Rei was, I saw the end of the world, I did horrible things but I eventually found redemption. I found it in the arms of the girl on the other side of this doorway. How much of that was a possibility though? How much of it was just my dream and my imagination? I know my feelings for Asuka were true but can the same be said of hers for me? I look down at the CD and I realize I don't even know if Asuka will really like it.  
我回想起被困在使徒体内的经历，我所见所历的一切。我甚至怀疑其中有多少是真实的。在那里，我目睹了太多事情，看到了绫波的真实身份，看到了世界的终结，我做了可怕的事，但最终找到了救赎。我在门那边的女孩怀中找到了它。然而，这些可能性有多大呢？有多少只是我的梦境和想象？我知道我对明日香的感情是真挚的，但她对我的感情也能这么说吗？我低头看着那张 CD，意识到我甚至不确定明日香是否会真的喜欢它。

Yet there has to be something in it. I had never heard of this band before that experience. I had never heard a song by them or knew of any of their tracks. Yet now I do, I can hear their music in my head. I can hear the singing, the guitars and the drums. There had to be some reality in there.  
然而其中必定有某种真实。在那次经历之前，我从未听说过这个乐队。我从未听过他们的任何一首歌，也不知道他们的任何曲目。但现在我知道了，我能在脑海中听到他们的音乐。我能听到歌声、吉他和鼓声。那里一定有某种现实存在。

I raise my hand and make a fist. I take a deep breath. I mumble the first thing I said before I got in the Eva.  
我举起手，握紧拳头。深吸一口气。我喃喃自语，重复着登上 Eva 之前说的第一句话。

"I mustn't run away…" “我不能逃避……”

I knock on the door three times and wait. For a time I hear nothing and then finally a shuffling sound from inside the room. Footsteps approaching the door, and it eventually slides open. Asuka is stood there, she's changed into a baggy yellow t-shirt and a small pair of denim shorts. She is staring directly at me, her expression similar to the one she wore back in the hospital.  
我敲了三下门，然后等待。起初我什么也没听到，直到最后房间里传来一阵拖沓的声响。脚步声向门口靠近，门最终滑开了。站在那儿的是明日香，她换上了一件宽松的黄色 T 恤和一条小巧的牛仔短裤。她直直地盯着我，表情与她在医院时如出一辙。

"What?" "什么？"

"I… Asuka… I…" “我…明日香…我…”

"Spit it out Third Child… what do you want?"  
“有话快说，第三适格者…你想要什么？”

I should have rehearsed this. I scramble around for something to say, anything to say that won't anger her. I just need to get through this initial part and give her the present. Then I can talk to her properly.  
我本该事先排练一下的。我慌乱地寻找着该说的话，任何不会惹她生气的话。我只需要熬过这最初的部分，把礼物给她。然后我就能好好和她交谈了。

My mouth has gone completely dry. As I look at her my mind keeps going back to everything I've experienced and seen. I look at her eyes glaring at me thinking about how they used to look when I stared into them on an evening. I look at her lips and think about how soft they were when we kissed. I look at her red hair and think about how it used to look when she stepped out the shower. Her body in those clothes, I'm thinking about how she used to mount me on an evening and make love to me.  
我的嘴巴干得要命。看着她，我的思绪不断回溯到我所经历和目睹的一切。我凝视着她那双瞪着我的眼睛，想起那些夜晚我凝视它们时的模样。我看着她的嘴唇，想起我们亲吻时它们是多么柔软。我看着她那头红发，想起她沐浴后走出来时的样子。她穿着那身衣服的身体，我想起那些夜晚她如何在我身上缠绵，与我做爱。

All of it though was just the conjurations of the Angel. I shouldn't be thinking about that. I can't think about that. I bow my head and stutter something out.  
然而，这一切不过是天使的幻象。我不该去想这些。我不能去想这些。我低下头，结结巴巴地说了些什么。

"I… I just wanted to say… I'm sorry for, what happened with the Angel… I shouldn't have done what I did."  
"我…我只是想说…对于与使徒发生的事情，我很抱歉…我不该那么做的。"

She rolls her eyes at me, "You know your apologies mean nothing when it's your stock response to everything."  
她对我翻了个白眼，"你知道你的道歉毫无意义，每次都是同样的回应。"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"Urgh, just leave me alone. I'm not in the mood to have Misato get at me again for upsetting her precious little Shinji…"  
"呃，别管我。我没心情再让美里因为我让她宝贝的 Shinji 难过而训斥我…"

She turns away and goes to slide the door closed. This really isn't going as I hoped it would. I don't know what possesses me to do it but I put my hand in the way just before she closes it and wedge it open. The door slides back open only this time she steps outside and steps right up to me.  
她转身走去推拉门旁，准备将其关闭。事情的发展完全出乎我的预料。我不知道是什么驱使我这么做，但在她即将关上门的那一刻，我伸手挡在了门缝中，强行将门撑开。门再次滑开，而这一次，她走出了门外，径直向我走来。

"You're overstepping your bounds Third, I already said to leave me alone."  
“你越界了，Third，我已经说过让你别来烦我。”

"Sorry but I… I…" “对不起，但我…我…”

Why can I just say it? With my hand trembling I slowly hold up the CD.  
为什么我不能直接说出来呢？我颤抖着手，缓缓举起那张 CD。

"I know I did something stupid, I should have let you take lead during it. I shouldn't have jumped the gun like that. I nearly got myself killed and I put you and Ayanami at risk. I… I know you're a better pilot than me."  
“我知道我做了件蠢事，我本该让你主导的。我不该那么冲动。我差点害死自己，还让你和绫波陷入危险。我……我知道你是个比我更优秀的驾驶员。”

"Go on…" “继续……”

"And I… I got you this to say I'm sorry… I mean really sorry, not just a response."  
"而我……我给你买了这个，想说对不起……我是说真的对不起，不只是随口一说。"

I force myself to look at her as her eyes dart from me to the CD. For a moment I see the anger drain from her face as she sees the CD in my hand. I see her eyes fill with surprise and a small smile spread across her face. She takes it off me and turns it over in her hand and reads through the contents of the boxset.  
我强迫自己看着她，她的目光从我身上移到 CD 上。有那么一刻，我看到她脸上的怒气消退，当她看到我手中的 CD 时。我看到她的眼睛充满了惊讶，一个小小的微笑在她脸上蔓延开来。她从我手中接过 CD，翻转着，阅读着盒装内容。

"I guess it'll do. I forgive you for now… Shinji."  
"我想这还行。我现在原谅你了……真嗣。"

I can finally breathe properly again. It wasn't quite the thank you I was hoping for but it's a start. It means that some of what I was shown was accurate. She turns around and goes back into her room and I decide maybe it's time to be a little bit braver.  
我终于又能正常呼吸了。这虽然不是我所期待的感谢方式，但总算是个开始。这意味着我所看到的一些事情是准确的。她转身回到自己的房间，我决定或许现在是时候稍微勇敢一点了。

"Asuka… would you… like to go out for dinner?"  
“明日香……你愿意……一起去吃晚餐吗？”

She stops in her tracks and turns around, her eyes reflecting some level of confusion. There are very few times I've seen Asuka confused. This is one of them.  
她突然停下脚步，转过身来，眼中流露出几分困惑。我很少见到明日香困惑的样子。这次就是其中之一。

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I… would you like to go out for dinner… with me?"  
"我…你想和我一起出去吃晚饭吗？"

She walks up to me and stares me straight in the eyes, "Are you feeling alright?"  
她走到我面前，直视我的眼睛，"你还好吗？"

I nod my head, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  
我点点头，也许这不是个好主意。

"Where?" "哪里？"

Now it's my turn to be confused, "Huh?"  
现在轮到我困惑了，"啊？"

"Idiot! I asked you where?"  
"傻瓜！我问你在哪里？"

"Oh… I… don't know…" "哦…我…不知道…"

She sighs, "You asked me if I want to go out for dinner and you don't know where to go? Do you even have a brain up there Third?"  
她叹了口气，"你问我是否想出去吃饭，你却不知道去哪儿？你脑袋里装了些什么，老三？"

"No… I mean yes! I just… wanted to make it up to you for…"  
"不…我是说，是的！我只是…想补偿你因为…"

"You're really going all out with this apology aren't you? In which case in this current state my answer is no. I wouldn't like to go out for dinner with you."  
你这次道歉真是全力以赴啊，对吧？既然如此，我现在的回答是——不。我不想和你出去吃饭。

"Oh…"

I can't help but hide my disappointment. She closes the door and I stand there for a few moments wondering what I did wrong. All of it most likely, it dawns on me that maybe what I saw in the Angel was a distorted reflection. Maybe it was all based on my perceptions, maybe my knowledge of the music Asuka listens to comes from a glimpse I caught of some of it when I saw her music player or her CD collection. Maybe it got shuffled to a part of my memory that I couldn't access but the Angel was able to see it.  
我忍不住掩饰自己的失望。她关上门，我站在那里愣了几分钟，思考我到底做错了什么。很可能全错了，我突然意识到，也许我眼中的天使只是一个扭曲的倒影。或许这一切都基于我的感知，我对明日香音乐的了解，可能只是偶然瞥见她的音乐播放器或 CD 收藏。也许这些记忆被移到了我无法触及的部分，但天使却能看到。

I go back over to the sofa and spot my SDAT sitting on the table in front of it. That's strange, I usually keep that in my room or I keep it in my bag when I have to go to NERV. Why is it out on the table like this? I pick it up and check it over. It's on track number three, I don't usually listen to that that means someone else has been using this. The battery has been fully charged, it was nearly dead when I last used it. I look back towards Asuka's door, she couldn't have could she?  
我回到沙发那边，发现我的 SDAT 放在它前面的桌子上。真奇怪，我通常把它放在房间里，或者去 NERV 时放在包里。为什么它会这样放在桌子上？我把它拿起来检查了一下。现在是第三轨，我平时不怎么听这个，这意味着有人用过它。电池已经完全充满，上次用的时候几乎没电了。我回头看向明日香的房门，不可能是她吧？

I put one of the earphones in and sit down on the sofa still feeling disappointed. She's probably on the other side of the door laughing at me right now. Thinking about how much of an idiot I must be. Buying her something and asking her out to dinner to say sorry. I turn the SDAT over and flick straight to track 26, before the music begins to play I hear a cough from the other side of the room.  
我塞上其中一只耳机，坐在沙发上仍然感到失望。她现在可能就在门后嘲笑我，想着我有多傻。买东西给她，还请她吃饭道歉。我把 SDAT 翻过来，直接跳到第 26 轨，音乐开始播放前，我听到房间另一头传来一声咳嗽。

I turn and see Asuka stood there wearing a green dress. I immediately recognize it as the one she wore on the night she came home and found me playing the cello. The same night we kissed, the same night I should have held her and not let her run away like that.  
我转过身，看到明日香站在那里，穿着一条绿色裙子。我立刻认出那是她回家发现我在拉大提琴那晚穿的同一条裙子。那晚我们接吻了，那晚我本该抱住她，而不是让她那样跑掉。

"Well, what are you staring at idiot? Are we going out or what?"  
"喂，你这个白痴在盯着什么看？我们到底要不要出去？"

"But Asuka I thought you…"  
"但是明日香，我以为你……"

"You can be so stupid sometimes, I said in the current state, you really expected me to go out for dinner dressed like that?"  
"你有时候真是蠢得可以，我说的是现在的状态，你真的以为我会那样打扮去吃晚餐吗？"

I shake my head, "I guess not."  
我摇摇头，“我想不是。”

"And that goes the same for you, someone like me can't be seen going out with someone dressed like that. Do you have any other clothes?"  
“对你也一样，像我这样的人不能被人看到和穿成那样的人出去。你有其他衣服吗？”

I'm confused, "Y-Yeah!" 我有些困惑，“嗯-嗯！”

"Well then go and put them on and hurry up about it. I've already phoned a place and they're expecting us."  
"那好吧，快去穿上，动作麻利点。我已经打电话预约了地方，他们正等着我们呢。"

I'm very confused right now, instead of questioning it I get to my feet and go into my room and dig out the smart clothes I have. I forget at this point I don't really have much but I'm able to find a suit jacket, smart shirt and I guess my regular school trousers will do.  
我现在一头雾水，但没多问，起身走进房间，翻出仅有的几件正装。我忘了自己其实没多少正装，不过还是找到了一件西装外套、一件衬衫，至于平时上学穿的裤子，勉强凑合吧。

I quickly throw the clothes on and emerge from my room. Asuka looks me over and sighs angrily, I don't know what I've done until she walks over to me and adjusts and straightens my collar.  
我迅速穿上衣服，从房间里走出来。明日香上下打量了我一番，生气地叹了口气，我不知道自己哪里做错了，直到她走过来，帮我调整并拉直了衣领。

She smiles at me and shakes her head, "You're useless."  
她朝我微笑，摇了摇头，“你真没用。”

Her tone isn't harsh when she says it, if anything it's playful. I find myself once again staring at her shining blue eyes.  
她说这话时语气并不严厉，反倒带着几分俏皮。我不由得再次凝视她那闪烁着光芒的蓝色眼眸。

'You're beautiful', I want to say it to her so badly but I just can't. Not yet. I probably shouldn't even be doing this yet. I should have waited a day, I should have waited a week but after everything I experienced I don't want to wait anymore. I have to know what is real and what isn't.  
“你真美”，我多么想对她说出口，却怎么也说不出来。还不是时候。或许我根本不该这么做。我应该再等一天，应该再等一周，但经历了这一切之后，我再也不想等待了。我必须弄清楚什么是真实的，什么不是。

We head towards the door and just before she opens it I call out to her, "Asuka…"  
我们走向门口，就在她打开门之前，我叫住了她，“明日香……”

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"You… you look really pretty."  
“你……你看起来真的很漂亮。”

"He took her out for dinner?"  
“他带她出去吃饭了？”

"Yup, full three course meal and everything, isn't that sweet?"  
"是啊，全套三道菜的晚餐，应有尽有，是不是很贴心？"

"Even in these times the ability for the young to find love is admirable."  
"即使在这样的时候，年轻人寻找爱情的能力也令人钦佩。"

"Yeah, although I don't think Asuka thinks of it in those terms."  
"是啊，不过我觉得明日香不会这么想。"

"No?"

"Of course not, 'it means nothing', 'He was just making up for his idiocy.' Although you should have seen how red she went and she hasn't stopped listening to the album he bought her since he gave it to her. It's so sweet isn't it Ritsuko?"  
"当然不是，‘这没什么意义’，‘他只是在弥补自己的愚蠢。’不过你真该看看她脸红的样子，自从他送给她那张专辑后，她就一直在听，从未停过。真是甜蜜，不是吗，律子？"

"It certainly is, and unexpected."  
"确实如此，而且出乎意料。"

"Oh I don't think so. There's always been something between the two of them, it just took a little nudge from one to the other that's all. I think the experience in the Angel might have made Shinji finally take that leap."  
"哦，我不这么认为。他们之间一直有些什么，只是需要其中一方稍加推动罢了。我想在使徒事件中的经历可能让真嗣终于迈出了那一步。"

"Mm Hmm…" "嗯哼…"

"You disapprove?" "你不赞成？"

"Of course not, I do however trust you know what you're doing. Remember you have two hormonal teenagers in your apartment, we don't want them to create a th-"  
"当然不是，但我相信你知道自己在做什么。记住，你的公寓里有两个荷尔蒙旺盛的青少年，我们不希望他们制造出什么麻烦——"

I can't take this anymore, I put my hands over my ears and stand up yelling, "STOP!"  
我再也受不了了，双手捂住耳朵站起来大喊：“停下！”

Misato turns and flashes me a smile, "Oh hey Shinji, forgot you were there for a moment? How is the paperwork going?"  
美里转过身来，对我露出一个微笑：“哦，嗨，真嗣，刚才一瞬间忘了你在那儿？文书工作进展如何？”

I shoot her a glare that tells her exactly how I'm feeling right now. She didn't forget I was there, she knew I was there as did Ritsuko. I finish sliding the papers into another folder.  
我瞪了她一眼，让她清楚地知道我现在的心情。她并没有忘记我在那里，她和律子都知道我在。我把文件滑进另一个文件夹里。

"Its fine, I'm nearly finished."  
"没事，我快完成了。"

"Well good, I should probably get going anyway. I've got a stack of paperwork to get through myself, unless you'd like to volunteer your services for that?"  
"那就好，我可能也该走了。我有一堆文件要处理，除非你想来帮忙？"

"No, I think… I think this is enough."  
"不，我觉得……我觉得这样就够了。"

Why did I have to open my big mouth about how sorry I was? It isn't that I wasn't sorry and I didn't want to make up for it but I didn't realize just how much paperwork these people have to do. Either that or they've just been neglecting it.  
我为什么要多嘴说自己有多抱歉呢？并非我不感到抱歉，也不是我不想弥补，只是我没想到这些人要处理这么多文书工作。要么就是他们一直疏于处理。

With a wink she leaves the room and says her goodbye to Ritsuko. It's quite strange to see those two on good terms again so soon after what happened. I wonder if any of it is genuine or if it's just a show. I haven't forgotten what I saw Ritsuko do while I was trapped, that tank and those clones within. Now I look at the doctor sat there reading through a document. Is she really capable of that?  
她眨了眨眼，离开了房间，向律子道别。看到她们俩这么快就和好如初，真是奇怪。我不知道这是否真诚，还是只是一场表演。我没有忘记被困时看到的律子所做的事，那个水槽和里面的克隆体。现在我看着坐在那里阅读文件的医生。她真的能做出那种事吗？

"You know Shinji, you have been different since you've returned."  
“你知道吗，真嗣，你回来后变得不一样了。”

"Huh, what do you mean?"  
"嗯，你什么意思？"

She puts down the document and looks at me, "Asking Asuka out to dinner, the way you talk to Misato and despite experiencing a slight drop your sync score is stable. You seem more, confident."  
她放下文件，看着我，"邀请明日香共进晚餐，你和美里说话的方式，尽管同步率略有下降但依然稳定。你看起来更有自信了。"

I'm not sure if it's a compliment or not, her voice is laden with suspicion. Does she know anything about what I saw? Maybe I moved too quickly in asking Asuka to dinner, maybe I should have just got her the present and left it at that. It's not like anything has happened, since that evening she has barely spoken to me. Nothing went wrong on the night, we went out to dinner and had a really nice meal. We spoke a little bit, I tried to find out details about her life before NERV. To try and compare it with the things I learned while I was in the Angel. She didn't say much, that she lived with a stepmother and her father, that she got accepted to a college early on and received a degree and that she had been training for Eva from a young age. She didn't talk about her mother and I didn't ask.  
我不确定这是不是在夸我，她的语气充满了怀疑。她知道我看到了什么吗？也许我太快邀请明日香共进晚餐了，也许我应该只送她礼物就够了。毕竟，自那晚之后她几乎没怎么和我说话。那晚其实也没出什么问题，我们出去吃了饭，享用了一顿美餐。我们聊了一会儿，我试图了解她在 NERV 之前的生活细节，想和我从使徒那里学到的东西做个比较。她没说太多，只提到了和继母以及父亲一起生活，很早就考上了大学并获得了学位，以及从小就开始接受 Eva 的训练。她没有谈及她的母亲，我也没有问。

I let her into my life to see her reaction. I told her about my mother, I watched Asuka's eyes for any change when I mentioned it. I could see the slight reaction even as she raised her guard. I told her that I think I'm finally happy for one of the first times in my life. She laughed and called me an idiot. We laughed a lot that night and yet she hasn't spoke to me since.  
我让她走进我的生活，观察她的反应。我向她谈起我的母亲，留意着明日香眼神中是否有变化。即便她提高了警惕，我仍能察觉到那一丝细微的反应。我告诉她，我觉得自己终于在人生中第一次感到真正的快乐。她笑了，称我为傻瓜。那一晚我们笑得很开心，但从那以后她再也没有和我说过话。

I had a dream last night. It was about Asuka. She was stood in a hospital room looking down at a body on a bed. It wasn't the Asuka I took to dinner but the one I knew from my time in the Angel. As she looked down at the body I realized something it was me, only I was stood behind her on the other side of the room. I tried to call out to her but she couldn't hear me. I tried to hold her but my arms went right through her.  
昨晚我做了一个梦，关于明日香的。她站在一间病房里，低头看着床上的一具身体。那不是我带去吃饭的明日香，而是我在天使时期认识的她。当她凝视着那具身体时，我意识到那是我自己，只是我站在房间的另一边，站在她身后。我试图呼唤她，但她听不见。我试图拥抱她，但我的手臂直接穿过了她。

All I could do was watch as she stood mumbling something to herself about how she had failed again. How she had no purpose left in life and how she will never be happy again. I wanted to desperately to reach out to her and tell her everything was going to be alright but all I could do was watch as she broke down.  
我只能眼睁睁地看着她站在那里，喃喃自语，说自己又一次失败了。她觉得自己在生活中已无目的，再也不会快乐了。我迫切地想要伸出援手，告诉她一切都会好起来的，但我只能看着她崩溃。

I woke up crying. I woke up and the first thing I did was wake Asuka up and see if she was alright. She slapped me for entering her room without her permission and told me that yes everything was fine. I told her I had a nightmare about her that felt real and I was really sorry and this would never happen again. For a moment I thought I saw her try to reach my hand but she stopped at the last moment instead she settled for calling me an idiot. I left the room and moments later I heard the sounds of _'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'_ start up.  
我哭着醒来。醒来后，我做的第一件事就是叫醒明日香，看看她是否安好。她因为我未经允许进入她的房间而扇了我一巴掌，并告诉我一切都好。我告诉她我梦见了她，那个梦感觉很真实，我真的很抱歉，以后不会再发生这种事了。有那么一刻，我以为她想伸手握住我的手，但她最后还是停住了，转而骂我是个白痴。我离开了房间，不久后听到了《The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway》的音乐声响起。

I don't know if my concern had any effect on her. I still don't know what the purpose of me being back here is but I made a promise after that. I wasn't going to stand by and watch any more. I was going to take action if I could because I already saw what could happen if I didn't. Maybe I have been given a second chance.  
我不知道我的关心对她是否有影响。我仍然不明白我回到这里的目的是什么，但那之后我许下了一个承诺。我不会再袖手旁观。如果我能做些什么，我就会采取行动，因为我已经见识过如果我不行动会发生什么。也许我得到了第二次机会。

_'You can't redo.' '你无法重来。'_

It was something we said to each other during that glimpse at another life, maybe I can. Maybe something happened that no one can explain and I have been given a chance. I look back up at Ritsuko who is still awaiting a response from me.  
那是我们在窥见另一种生活时彼此说的话，也许我可以。也许发生了一些无人能解释的事情，而我得到了一个机会。我抬头看向丽津子，她仍在等待我的回应。

"I… didn't realize." “我…没有意识到。”

"It's not a bad thing, just unexpected. I'm still interested in learning what happened to you in there."  
“这不是坏事，只是出乎意料。我仍然对你在那里面经历了什么很感兴趣。”

I want to snap back at her that I nearly died because of her plan, if my Eva hadn't… if my mother hadn't have saved me at the last second her stupid plan would have killed me. That's what nearly happened to me in there. I can't do that though, I'm not supposed to know about that. I wonder then if I can maybe say anything about what I experienced. Maybe if I say something vague to her, but then… she mentioned the Angel tried to communicate with me. She'll just want to run tests on me. I don't want that.  
我想反驳她，我差点因为她那个计划丧命，如果不是我的 Eva……如果不是我母亲在最后一刻救了我，她那个愚蠢的计划早就害死我了。那是我差点经历的命运。但我不能这么说，我不该知道这些。我在想，我是否能透露一些我所经历的事情。也许我可以对她含糊其辞，但随后……她提到了天使试图与我沟通。她只会想对我进行测试。我不愿意那样。

"I… had some strange dreams, that's all and they just made me think."  
“我……做了一些奇怪的梦，仅此而已，它们让我思考。”

"Oh, about what?" “哦，关于什么？”

"About why I pilot the Eva… and about my friends and Misato… I kinda, realized how lucky I am in some ways."  
“关于我为什么驾驶 Eva…还有我的朋友们和美里…我有点意识到，在某些方面我真的很幸运。”

"Sounds like you had a real, 'It's A Wonderful Life' experience."  
“听起来你经历了一次真正的‘生活多美好’式的体验。”

I don't know what she means but I nod, "I guess so."  
我不太明白她的意思，但还是点头道：“我想是的。”

"Well I think that's enough for today, you should probably get back. You wouldn't want to keep Asuka waiting."  
"嗯，我想今天到此为止吧，你或许该回去了。你不会想让明日香等的。"

There are still a large number of papers to go through but I nod taking the opportunity to escape. I get to the doorway but stop before leaving. I don't know why I'm about to say this, but I think about what I've said about standing by. I can't give myself away with what I've learned, even though I know it might not be true. I know my father is like me in so many ways, I know the slightest word could change him from the right person. Maybe I can try, I have to.  
还有大量文件需要处理，但我点头抓住机会逃离。我走到门口，却在离开前停下。我不知道为何要说这些，但我想起自己关于支持的话语。我不能透露我所了解的，即便我知道那可能并非真相。我深知父亲在许多方面与我相似，我知道最微小的言语都可能让他从正确的人转变。也许我可以尝试，我必须这么做。

"Dr Akagi… how often do you see my father?"  
"赤木博士……您多久见一次我父亲？"

"As the lead of Project E I'm in regular contact with him, why?"  
"作为 E 计划的负责人，我经常与他联系，怎么了？"

"Could you give him a message from me? I don't… really see him and when I've tried he is always busy."  
"你能帮我给他带个口信吗？我不……真的见不到他，每次尝试他总是很忙。"

"Well your father has a busy schedule and he…"  
"嗯，你父亲日程很满，而且他……"

"I don't care about that, can you please just tell him… that I know he misses my mother, and I do too but she is gone and we should move forward and let her rest. I… I don't think she'd want us to dwell on her death too much."  
"我不在乎那个，你能告诉他…我知道他想念我母亲，我也一样，但她已经离开了，我们应该向前看，让她安息。我…我不认为她会希望我们过于沉溺于她的离世。"

I don't turn around but I can already feel her curious glance at me. Have I said too much? No, I kept that vague and it's barely been any time since me and he visited the grave together so she knows it'll be fresh in my mind.  
我没有转身，但已经能感觉到她好奇的目光落在我身上。我说得太多了吗？不，我保持了模糊，而且我和他一起拜访墓地才没过多久，她知道这会让我记忆犹新。

"You think he still misses your mother?"  
"你觉得他还在想念你母亲吗？"

"I do, and I think a part of him does too but I was just thinking that… sometimes we have to let things go…"  
"我确实这么想，我觉得他的一部分也是这样，但我只是在想……有时候我们必须放手……"

"That's quite a mature thing for you to say Shinji, another experience from your dreams?"  
"真成熟啊，真嗣，这是你梦中的又一次经历吗？"

"Yeah… you could say that."  
"是啊……可以这么说。"

I walk out straight out not letting her respond to me. I don't know if she'd tell my father that, I don't know how he'd react to it. Maybe he wouldn't react to it, maybe he'd just dismiss it as he did everything I tried to say to him. Or maybe, just maybe there is a chance it'll trigger something. A simple action can trigger change in people. If what I saw was the truth then maybe I can change that.  
我径直走出房间，没给她回应我的机会。我不确定她是否会告诉我父亲这件事，也不知道他会作何反应。也许他对此不会有任何反应，也许他会像对待我试图向他表达的一切那样，对此不屑一顾。但也或许，仅仅是或许，这可能会引发一些变化。一个简单的举动就能在人们身上触发改变。如果我所见的是真相，那么也许我能改变它。

### Chapter 13 Ambivalence
I'm lying awake, palm of my hand to my head and staring straight up at the now familiar ceiling of the room I call home. How many times have I done this? Replayed events from my past again and again in my mind to the point that I wish I could just shut it all off. I've been back for a week now and in that time I've tried to maybe shift things from the direction I saw in other time. I still question how much of it was true, and that's what's been playing on my mind this time. If what I saw was true we're soon going to be attacked by another Angel and this one, I really don't know what to do.  
我躺在床上，无法入眠，手掌贴着额头，直直地凝视着这个我称之为家的房间里那片如今已熟悉的屋顶。这样的情景我重复了多少次？一遍遍在脑海中重演过去的片段，直到我希望自己能将这一切关闭。我回来已经一周了，这段时间里，我试图改变那些在另一个时空中看到的轨迹。我仍在质疑那些景象的真实性，而这正是这次困扰我的问题。如果我所见为真，我们很快将遭到另一名使徒的攻击，而这一次，我真的不知道该如何应对。

I wish I could talk to someone about it, if Asuka only knew what I had gone through and what I had seen she'd know what to do. Yet she is barely speaking to me. I don't know what I did wrong, I tried to apologize to her and make things up to her by asking her out. Maybe she doesn't have the same feelings for me that I do for her in reality. Yet, there is something there.  
我真希望能找个人谈谈，如果明日香知道我经历了什么、看到了什么，她一定会知道该怎么办。然而她现在几乎不和我说话。我不知道自己哪里做错了，我试图向她道歉，甚至邀请她出去以弥补过错。也许在现实中，她对我的感情并不像我对她的那样。然而，总感觉有些什么。

I just wish I knew what to do. I know that if that does happen I need to fight but I don't know if I can bring myself to. Yet if I don't my father will activate the dummy plug and it'll end up getting worse. I've replayed those images in my head over and over, from Asuka's shocked exclamations of me not knowing who was inside. She got taken out by it because she had been distracted by me. If that hadn't happened we'd have stood a better chance.  
我只希望自己知道该怎么做。我知道如果真的发生那种情况，我必须战斗，但我不知道自己能否下得了手。但如果我不行动，父亲会启动傀儡系统，情况只会变得更糟。那些画面在我脑海中一遍遍重演，从明日香震惊地喊着我不知里面是谁开始。她被那东西击倒，是因为被我分了心。如果没有发生那件事，我们的胜算会更大。

I couldn't fight because I knew there was another human being inside but this time I know who it is. So how can I fight now? I know that if I do fight then every single punch, kick and attack with the Eva is going to hurt Touji. Yet if I don't he'll lose limbs and end up worse. Asuka… she would know what to do, she'd be able to come up with a plan.  
我无法战斗，因为我知道里面还有另一个人，但这次我知道是谁。那么我现在怎么能战斗呢？我知道如果我动手，EVA 的每一拳、每一脚、每一次攻击都会伤害到真治。但如果我不行动，他会失去肢体，情况会更糟。明日香……她会知道该怎么做，她一定能想出个计划。

I hear the final notes of track twenty six on my SDAT fade out and begin the process of rewinding it. In that brief silence in between I hear a noise outside my door. Someone reaching for the handle to slide it open. It's probably Misato come to tell me she's back. I take my earphones out and wait to greet her but I'm instead surprised when I see Asuka enter the room and close the door behind her.  
我听着 SDAT 上第二十六轨的尾声渐渐消逝，开始倒带。在那短暂的静默间隙，我听到门外传来声响。有人正伸手去拉门把手，试图推开。可能是美里回来告诉我她回来了。我摘下耳机，准备迎接她，却惊讶地看到明日香走进房间，随后关上了门。

In what little light there is I can see she looks pale, her eyes don't have the fire that they usually do. I wonder for a moment if she is sleepwalking but she fixes her gaze on me. All I can do is stammer out her name.  
在微弱的灯光下，我看到她脸色苍白，眼中失去了往日的神采。我一时疑惑她是否在梦游，但她目光坚定地看向我。我只能结结巴巴地叫出她的名字。

"A-Asuka?" "A-明日香？"

"Is it alright if I sleep in here tonight… my room... I think there is something wrong with the window, the wind keeps on blowing through and keeping me awake."  
“今晚我可以睡在这里吗……我的房间……我觉得窗户有问题，风一直吹进来，让我无法入睡。”

She doesn't even wait for me to respond as she moves over to the bed. I move across closer to the wall and allow her to climb on top of it. I let her take as much of the cover as she wants as she lies down facing away from me. I realize I'm nervous, just as I was the first time we shared a bed in that other reality. I'm unable to move but I really need to put my SDAT on the bedside table.  
她甚至不等我回应，就径直走向床边。我挪向墙边，让她能爬上来。她背对着我躺下，我任由她占据尽可能多的被子。我意识到自己很紧张，就像我们在另一个现实中第一次同床共枕时一样。我动弹不得，但我真的需要把 SDAT 放在床头柜上。

Slowly I pick it up and place it on the table careful not to touch Asuka. I lie back down and cover myself in what little of the blankets remain. It's a rare cold night tonight, although there isn't any wind outside like Asuka mentioned. I gaze across at her and realize from the way she is holding the cover that sleep hasn't hit her yet.  
我慢慢地拿起它，小心翼翼地放在桌子上，避免碰到明日香。我重新躺下，用剩下的毯子盖住自己。今晚是个少有的寒冷夜晚，尽管如明日香所说，外面并没有风。我凝视着她，从她紧抓被子的方式意识到，她还没有入睡。

"Hey Asuka…" "嘿，明日香…"

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"Do you ever have… nightmares?"  
“你有没有……做过噩梦？”

No answer from her although I can sense her grip tighten on the covers as they move a bit more off of me.  
她没有回答，但我能感觉到她抓着被子的手握得更紧了，被子从我身上移开了一些。

"No."

Her answer is blunt and to the point, it's a lie and I know it. I heard her on that night we have the synchronisation training. I already knew she'd lie to me when she answered though, that wasn't why I had asked. After a while she responds, "Why are you asking about nightmares anyway?"  
她的回答直截了当，明显是谎言，我知道。在我们进行同步训练的那个晚上，我听到了她的声音。尽管如此，我知道她会对我撒谎，这并不是我问她的原因。过了一会儿，她反问道：“你为什么突然问起噩梦的事？”

"I… had one last night and I've been thinking…"  
“我……昨晚做了一个噩梦，我一直在想……”

"It was just a stupid nightmare, they aren't worth thinking about."  
"那只是个愚蠢的噩梦，不值得去想。"

"I know that… sorry." "我知道……对不起。"

There is another pause, I wanted to say more but I just can't bring myself to. She sounds irritated by any word from me. I guess I would be too if I had been trying to sleep for hours only for it to come to nothing and have to share a bed with someone who kept talking. Instead of saying anything else I turn around and face the wall and close my eyes.  
又是一阵沉默，我想说些什么，却怎么也开不了口。她似乎对我的每一句话都感到烦躁。如果换作是我，尝试入睡数小时却毫无成效，还得和一个不停说话的人共睡一床，我也会感到烦躁。我没有再说什么，只是转过身面向墙壁，闭上了眼睛。

About a minute passed before I feel the grip on the covers slack, "What was it about?"  
大约过了一分钟，我感觉被子上的抓握松了些，“那是什么梦？”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Your nightmare stupid. If I'm going to sleep in here tonight I may as well put your mind at rest, I don't want you waking me up my screaming your sleep or whatever."  
“你的噩梦，蠢货。如果我今晚要睡在这里，不如先让你安心，我不想你半夜尖叫把我吵醒什么的。”

I roll onto my back, she is still facing away from me but I begin to tell her about my nightmare.  
我翻身仰躺，她依然背对着我，但我开始向她讲述我的噩梦。

"I… had a nightmare that they had another Evangelion coming here… but… it turned out to be an Angel… and we had to fight it."  
"我……做了一个噩梦，梦见他们又送来了一台 EVA……但……结果那是个使徒……我们不得不与之战斗。"

She's silent so I take that as an opportunity to continue.  
她沉默不语，我便趁机继续说下去。

"But… I couldn't fight it, I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt another person but I… didn't want to die either."  
"可是……我无法与之战斗，我不知道该怎么办。我不想伤害别人，但我……也不想死。"

"So what did you do?"  
"那你做了什么？"

"Nothing…" "什么也没做……"

"Idiot. If it's between you and someone else you fight…"  
"傻瓜。如果是你和别人之间的事，你就得战斗……"

"Would you be able to fight… even if it meant hurting someone else?"  
"你能战斗吗…即使这意味着会伤害到别人？"

"Yes, if the alternative was dying I'd fight. It's a stupid nightmare anyway, that couldn't happen… and even if it did. You wouldn't have to fight, I'd be more than capable of beating it for you and I'd save the pilot too. How does that sound?"  
"是的，如果选择是死亡，我会战斗。反正这是个愚蠢的噩梦，不可能发生…就算真的发生了。你也不用战斗，我有足够的能力为你打败它，还会救出飞行员。你觉得怎么样？"

"Really? How?" "真的吗？怎么做？"

"Well I don't know do I, I'm not in your head apparently and probably thankfully if I was in your dream god knows what perverted fantasies you'd have about me. I'd probably try to get the Entry Plug out. There, problem solved. So if you have that nightmare again you just do that and then tell me that I saved the day even if it is in your stupid nightmares."  
“我怎么知道呢，我又不在你脑子里，显然也不在，谢天谢地。要是我真在你梦里，天知道你会对我有什么变态幻想。我可能会试着逃出插入栓。瞧，问题解决了。所以如果你再做那个噩梦，就这么办，然后告诉我我救了场，哪怕是在你那愚蠢的梦里。”

Smiling I nod, "Yeah… I'll do that, thank you Asuka. Good night."  
我微笑着点头，“嗯……我会这么做的，谢谢你，明日香。晚安。”

"Whatever." “随便。”

She tightens her grip on the covers again and I lie there on my back for a moment.  
她再次抓紧了被子，而我则平躺着，静静地待了一会儿。

"I'm cold. Why does Misato have to get blankets that don't cover our feet and are thin like this?"  
"我好冷。为什么美里拿的毯子总是盖不住脚，还这么薄？"

"I… that's just the way they are."  
"我……它们就是这样子的。"

"Well it's stupid, I can't sleep when I'm cold like this."  
"真是蠢，这么冷我怎么睡得着。"

I think if maybe I have something in the room to help her warm up but unfortunately all the blankets are the same. The only thing that might work is… but no I can't do that, she'll… but maybe she won't… if I don't try I'll never know. The worst she can do is tell me to stop, call me a pervert and storm out and at least then I'll know for certain.  
我想，如果房间里有什么能帮她暖和起来的东西就好了，但遗憾的是所有的毯子都一样。唯一可能有效的是……但不行，我不能那么做，她会……但也许她不会……如果我不尝试，我永远不会知道。最坏的结果不过是她让我停下，骂我是变态然后愤然离去，至少那样我会确切地知道结果。

I turn around again until I'm facing her, she still has her back to me but I slowly reach out my arm and place it around her side. It's awkward as I do it whilst trying to maintain the distance between our bodies. As my arm makes contact with her I feel her entire body tense up. This is the part where she tells me to get off and yells at me. I brace myself for it.  
我再次转身，直到面对着她，她依然背对着我，但我慢慢地伸出胳膊，轻轻地环绕在她的身侧。这样做的同时还要保持我们之间的距离，显得有些笨拙。当我的手臂触碰到她时，我能感觉到她的整个身体都紧绷了起来。接下来她会让我放手并对我大吼大叫，我为此做好了准备。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

"I-I… well I'm trying to make you warmer…"  
“我……我……嗯，我在试着让你暖和些……”

It sound so stupid but that is genuinely what I'm trying to do and I guess I also just wanted to hold her.  
这听起来很蠢，但我的确是在努力这么做，我想我也是单纯地想抱抱她。

"Idiot…" “傻瓜……”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

I begin to raise my arm from her side but from the slightest movement I feel her hand grab my wrist.  
我开始从她身边抬起手臂，但就在最轻微的动作中，我感觉到她的手抓住了我的手腕。

"I didn't tell you to stop. Just stay there for a while, I'll allow it for tonight."  
"我没让你停下。就待在那儿一会儿，今晚我允许你这样。"

I let my arm go back over her as I shuffle in a little bit closer. As I do so I notice her hand put itself over mine and squeeze it gently. I don't know if I'm supposed to hear it but she whispers.  
我让手臂重新搭在她身上，同时挪近了一点。就在这时，我注意到她的手覆盖在我的手上，轻轻地握了握。我不知道这是否是我应该听到的，但她低声说道。

"Thank you… I feel much warmer now…"  
"谢谢你……我现在感觉暖和多了……"

I close my eyes as I feel the warm liquid wash over me. I've had this happen to me so many times now but I still get that little feeling of panic whenever it happens. My mind still doesn't quite make the instant connection that the LCL is breathable. So whenever I have to do this I'll close my eyes until it's completely over me. I'll still get that little spike in my stomach when I feel the smell of blood hit my nose but it's a lot better than with my eyes open.  
我闭上眼睛，感受着温暖的液体覆盖全身。这种事已经发生过太多次，但每次仍会感到一丝恐慌。我的大脑仍未立即意识到 LCL 是可以呼吸的。所以每次都必须闭上眼睛，直到它完全淹没我。尽管如此，当血腥味冲击鼻腔时，胃里仍会涌起一阵不适，但总比睁着眼睛要好。

Today is my first synchronisation test since the incident with the twelth Angel. Since I lived through that other reality. I don't know what they're expecting of me, I don't know what to expect from myself. I don't know my synchronisation ratio will go up or down after it. If I remember correctly the last test I did it was up, I was ahead of everyone and I got praised for it. I liked getting praise but it led to me making a stupid mistake. I was stupid and arrogant all because that little number next to my name was higher than Ayanami's or Asukas'.  
今天是与第十二使徒事件后的首次同步率测试。经历了那次异界之旅，我不知道他们对我有何期待，也不知道自己会有何表现。同步率是会上升还是下降，我无从知晓。如果没记错，上次测试时我的同步率领先众人，因此受到了表扬。我喜欢被赞扬，但这导致我犯了个愚蠢的错误。我变得愚蠢且自大，只因名字旁边那个数字超过了绫波或明日香。

Yet that number is meaningless, it only tells us how in tune we are with the Evangelion and the soul that inhabits it. The higher the number the more control we have and in turn the more we hurt when it does. Yet it doesn't mean we're better as a pilot for it. Asuka is a far better pilot than I am yet our sync ratios are similar. I guess it's a way of measuring something and Asuka seems to take pride in it.  
然而那个数字毫无意义，它仅告诉我们与福音战士及其内藏灵魂的同步程度。数字越高，我们的控制力越强，反之，当它发生时，我们受到的伤害也越大。但这并不意味着我们作为驾驶员就更优秀。明日香比我更出色的驾驶员，然而我们的同步率却相似。我想这是一种衡量某种东西的方式，而明日香似乎对此颇为自豪。

My plugsuit feels unusually tight around me today, especially around the throat. I've always found it a bit uncomfortable but today more so than ever. Maybe it's because I'm more nervous today of doing this. With what I've experienced it feels so foreign to me. For these people it's been around a week but for me… it's felt like six months.  
今天，我的插入栓服感觉异常紧绷，尤其是喉咙周围。我一直觉得它有点不舒服，但今天比以往更甚。也许是因为我今天对做这件事更加紧张。对我来说，这种感觉如此陌生。对这些人来说，这已经过去了一周，但对我来说……感觉像是过了六个月。

I finally open my eyes and the liquid goes from orange to clear. The dim lights of the Entry Plug surround me as I casually rest my hands on the controls. I lie back and try to make my mind as empty as possible. I hide a smile as I imagine Asuka's voice telling the world that that wouldn't be difficult. This parts always so difficult, emptying my mind to eliminate interference. How can I empty my mind after I've been told to, just being told to is inviting me to think about things.  
我终于睁开眼睛，液体从橙色变为清澈。驾驶舱内昏暗的灯光环绕着我，我随意地将手放在控制器上。我向后躺下，尽量让思绪放空。我藏起一丝微笑，想象着明日香的声音告诉世界，这并不难。这一部分总是如此困难，清空思绪以消除干扰。仅仅是被要求清空思绪，这不就是在邀请我去思考吗？

"Okay Shinji, no pressure on this one just do what you usually do."  
“好吧，真嗣，这次别有压力，就按平常那样做。”

"Right." "对。"

I close my eyes again and try to relax. Straight away my mind wanders to Asuka in the Entry plug to my left. I wonder what she does in this situation. I wonder how she relaxes and if she is nervous before a sync test or even being deployed. She barely spoke to me again this morning, we both woke up together and she left the bed without saying a word. She thanked me for making her breakfast but that has been about it. I wonder if I helped her last night, if she had any nightmares.  
我再次闭上眼睛，试图放松。立刻，我的思绪飘向了左边驾驶舱里的明日香。我想知道在这种情况下她会怎么做。我想知道她如何放松，以及在进行同步测试甚至部署前是否会紧张。今早她几乎没有和我说话，我们一起醒来，她一言不发地离开了床。她感谢我为她做早餐，但也就仅此而已。我不知道昨晚我是否帮到了她，她是否做了噩梦。

---

Finally I hear Misato's voice over the intercom again.  
终于，我又通过对讲机听到了美里小姐的声音。

"Okay guys we're done now. You all did really well! Asuka you're up five points on your best, Rei you're up two points and Shinji you've dropped behind Asuka but you're stable. Good work everyone, you've got the rest of the day free."  
“好了，各位，我们完成了。你们都表现得非常出色！明日香，你比最好成绩提高了五分，绫波你提高了两分，而真嗣你虽然落后于明日香，但表现稳定。大家做得很好，今天剩下的时间你们可以自由活动了。”

I feel the Entry Plug rise out of the pool as the LCL drains from it. I'm actually smiling at hearing that, I've dropped but I expected that and Asuka is in first place again. She'll be happy with that. Eventually the Entry Plug reaches the platform and the door opens up. I climb out onto the platform and see a few techs walk past me and start securing the Entry Plug.  
我感觉到插入栓从水池中升起，LCL 液体随之排空。听到这个消息，我竟然笑了，虽然我落后了，但这是预料之中的事，明日香再次位居第一。她会为此感到高兴的。最终，插入栓到达平台，门打开后，我爬了出来，看到几名技术人员从我身边走过，开始固定插入栓。

It's funny but I never realize the amount of people who work here. Securing the Entry Plugs, making sure the LCL has drained correctly, ensuring it's filtered correctly and that nothing goes wrong. I've never spoken to any of them, I don't think any of us have. I turn around to the two that have passed me and I call back.  
说来好笑，我从未意识到这里有多少工作人员。他们负责固定插入栓，确保 LCL 正确排空，过滤得当，确保一切无误。我从未与他们中的任何人交谈过，我想我们中没有人这样做过。我转身对刚刚经过我的两人喊道。

"Hey… Um… thanks for… doing what you guys do…"  
“嘿…嗯…谢谢你们…做你们所做的事…”

The taller one of the two smiles, "Hey no big deal kid, you're the one fighting for us. Least we can do is make sure your systems run correctly, ya know what I mean?"  
两人中较高的那个微笑着说，“嘿，小事一桩，孩子，你才是为我们而战的人。我们至少能做的就是确保你的系统正常运行，你懂我的意思吧？”

I nod, "Yeah but… thank you all the same."  
我点头，“嗯，不过……还是谢谢你。”

I walk off and climb go down the walk way to find Asuka waiting for me. A grin on her face, "Well Shinji, I knew your little reign at the top was nothing more than a fluke but now I'm back in first again as I should be."  
我走开，顺着通道下去，发现明日香在等我。她脸上挂着得意的笑容，“怎么样，真嗣，我就知道你那短暂的榜首位置不过是侥幸，现在我又回到了第一，这才是我应有的位置。”

I smile, "Yeah… Congratulations Asuka. You deserve it."  
我微笑道，“是啊……恭喜你，明日香。这是你应得的。”

She sighs and rolls her eyes, "Urgh, whatever… just make sure you don't do anything stupid next time right? I'm going to go visit Kaji."  
她叹了口气，翻了个白眼，“呃，随你吧……下次别再干蠢事就行，对吧？我要去找加持了。”

She pushes past me and leaves the room. I can't help but feel I said something wrong there but what? I congratulated her on getting back to number one. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, maybe she just wanted to go and see Kaji.  
她从我身边挤过去，离开了房间。我不禁觉得刚才说错了什么，但究竟是什么呢？我祝贺她重回第一的位置。也许我只是多心了，也许她只是想去找加持。

Suddenly I get a strange sense of dread as I remember what happened in that other place. It's around this time they select the fourth child… Asuka found out when she went to visit Kaji. Is the same thing going to happen this time? If it does then Asuka won't tell me and Misato won't tell me either. I have to know somehow and there is only one way I can find out, I have to be there when Asuka does. I quickly rush back to my locker room to shower and get changed. If I'm quick I can be there just as she finds out.  
突然间，我感到一种莫名的恐惧，想起了在那个地方发生的事。大约这个时候，他们会选出第四适格者……明日香就是在去找加持时得知的。同样的事情这次还会发生吗？如果会，明日香不会告诉我，美里也不会。我必须设法知道，而唯一的方法就是，在明日香得知的那一刻在场。我迅速赶回更衣室洗澡换衣服。如果动作快，我就能在她得知消息时赶到。

---

I round the corner towards Kaji's office and hear her voice yelling, "What! No it can't be! I refuse to accept it!"  
我拐向加治的办公室，听到她的声音在喊：“什么！不，这不可能！我绝不接受！”

My heart sinks immediately knowing what she is yelling at. I approach the office just in time for her to storm out and collide with me. I stumble backwards as she yells.  
我的心立刻沉了下去，知道她在对什么大喊。我走近办公室，正好赶上她冲出来撞到我。我向后踉跄，她还在喊。

"Watch where you're going idiot!"  
“看路啊，白痴！”

"S-Sorry... I... are you alright?"  
"对-对不起...我...你还好吗？"

"No I'm not alright! Now get out of my way!"  
"我不好！现在别挡我的路！"

She storms past me but I call out to her, I need to make sure about what she is yelling about. Maybe I'm wrong and it isn't to do with Touji.  
她怒气冲冲地从我身边走过，但我还是喊住了她，我需要确认她在嚷嚷什么。也许是我错了，这和东治无关。

"W-Wait! What's wrong?" “等-等等！怎么了？”

She stops immediately and I hear her sigh, "I'll tell you what's wrong Shinji. Not only do I have to carry you and Wondergirl in this place but now I'll have to put up with your idiot friend Touji being here as well. As if I don't have to put up with that moron enough at school now he'll be here as well!"  
她立刻停下脚步，我听到她叹了口气，“我会告诉你怎么了，真嗣。我不仅要在这里背着你和明日香，现在还得忍受你那白痴朋友东治也在这里。好像在学校里忍受那个笨蛋还不够，现在他也要来这里添乱！”

That confirms it, the activation will be in a couple of days. It'll go wrong and I'll have to fight and hurt Touji. I look down at the ground, maybe there is something I can do... maybe I can persuade Misato to not do the test or put it off or select someone else.  
这证实了，激活将在几天后进行。事情会出错，我将不得不与东治战斗并伤害他。我低头看着地面，也许有什么我能做的...也许我能说服美里不进行测试，或者推迟它，或者选择其他人。

"Oh..." "哦..."

"Oh? Is that all you can say?"  
"哦？你就只能说这个吗？"

"I... is there no one else who can do it?"  
"我... 没有其他人能做这件事吗？"

"Are you stupid? Of course there isn't, we're chosen because we're the only ones who can do it. Just make sure you tell him to stay out of my way."  
“你傻吗？当然没有，我们被选中正是因为只有我们能做这件事。确保你告诉他别挡我的路。”

I don't reply to her as a feeling of nausea passes through me, she storms off as I sink against the wall wondering what to do. I thought that maybe having knowledge of what would happen would help me in some way. Maybe having seen all of that stuff would have made me into a better person going forward. The only thing that has happened is I feel worse. I feel more powerless than ever.  
我没有回应她，一阵恶心感袭来，她怒气冲冲地离开，我则靠在墙上，不知所措。我原以为，或许知道将要发生的事情会在某种程度上帮助我。也许目睹了那些事情会让我成为一个更好的人，向前迈进。但唯一发生的事情是我感觉更糟了。我感到前所未有的无力。

I watch as Asuka rounds the corner, she's the only one who can help me. She is the only one capable of understanding me and all I've done is made her madder at me than she ever has been.  
我看着明日香转过拐角，她是唯一能帮助我的人。她是唯一能理解我的人，而我所做的一切只是让她比以往任何时候都更生我的气。

There is one tiny glimmer of hope though, I told her last night about the nightmare. I used what I had seen and told her I had a nightmare. It wasn't a lie, I have had nightmares about that moment. She said she'd try to remove the Entry Plug... but how? I can't do that. That's why I need her.  
尽管如此，仍有一丝微弱的希望，我昨晚告诉她关于那个噩梦的事。我利用我所见到的，告诉她我做了一个噩梦。这并非谎言，我的确梦见过那一刻。她说她会尝试移除插入栓……但怎么做呢？我做不到。这就是为什么我需要她。

---

Misato left for the activation test this morning. Those past couple of days went by too quickly. All I've done is think about it, that moment when our phones go off and we're summoned to NERV. We'll be told something went wrong, we'll be told my father will be taking over the operation. Asuka will be placed on point and in a moment of distraction will be taken out. It'll bypass Rei with no issues and then I'll stand between it and NERV.  
美里今早去参加激活测试了。过去的几天过得太快了。我所做的只是思考，当我们的手机响起，被召唤到 NERV 的那一刻。我们会被告知出了问题，我们会被告知我的父亲将接管行动。明日香会被置于前线，并在分心的一瞬间被击倒。它会毫无阻碍地绕过绫波，然后我将站在它和 NERV 之间。

I won't be able to do anything. I won't be able to fight it because I know there is another human being inside. Now that I know who it is I know I definitely won't be able to fight it because I know that every single hit I inflict on it will be hurting Touji. So it'll pass that my father will activate the dummy plug system and it'll cripple my friend.  
我将无能为力。我无法与之战斗，因为我知道里面有另一个人类。现在我知道了那是谁，我更确定我无法战斗，因为我知道我每一次击中它，都会伤害到冬二。所以，我的父亲会启动傀儡系统，它会让我朋友瘫痪。

I've felt sick all morning, it feels exactly like I did when I woke up on that beach. That anything that enters my system is going to exit it immediately. So I skipped breakfast, Misato must have noticed something was wrong because she asked if I wanted to stay off school today. Even Asuka looked concerned. I'm not surprised, I've always been pale but when I looked in the mirror I looked like a ghost. I guess this is what happens when you know your best friend is about to get seriously injured.  
整个早上我都感觉不舒服，那种感觉和我那天在海滩上醒来时一模一样。仿佛任何进入我体内的东西都会立刻离开。所以我没吃早餐，美里一定察觉到了什么不对劲，因为她问我今天是否想请假不上学。就连明日香也显得很担心。我并不惊讶，我一向脸色苍白，但当我照镜子时，我看起来像个幽灵。我想这就是当你知道你最好的朋友即将受重伤时会发生的事情。

We've not been in the lesson long and I keep on looking at my watch waiting for the moment it all goes wrong. With every minute that passes my stomach churns a little bit more, I mentally plan the quickest way out of the room in case I have to throw up.  
我们上课没多久，我就一直看着手表，等待着一切出错的那一刻。随着每一分钟的流逝，我的胃翻腾得越来越厉害，我在心里计划着最快离开教室的方法，以防我不得不呕吐。

A flashing square appears on my computer and I see a message from Asuka waiting for me.  
我的电脑上出现了一个闪烁的方块，我看到明日香给我发了一条消息。

_"Why are you still here? Don't expect me to carry you home if you're ill!"  
“你为什么还在这儿？别指望我生病了会送你回家！”_

I look around and see her avert her gaze from me just as my eyes meet hers. I can see genuine concern on her face, or is that just my mind playing tricks? For a moment I can almost picture that moment on the beach, where she questioned me about how ill I had been. Where she gave me the crackers and water to help settle my stomach. It's such a vivid image, even though I felt so low it's a pleasant one. It was the start of something and yet it wasn't real.  
我环顾四周，看到她在我目光与她相遇时移开了视线。我能在她脸上看到真正的关切，还是只是我的心理作用？有那么一刻，我几乎能想象到我们在海滩上的那一刻，她问我有多不舒服。她给了我饼干和水来帮助我缓解胃部不适。尽管当时我感觉很低落，但那是一个生动的、愉快的记忆。那是某件事的开始，然而那并不是真实的。

I type a message back to her confessing part of the reason I'm ill, _"I'm fine, I'm worried about Misato... what if something goes wrong?"_  
我给她回了一条信息，坦白了我生病的部分原因，“我没事，我担心美里……万一出了什么事怎么办？”

_"Idiot! Nothing is going to go wrong, and besides even if it does I'm here. Just... go home if you're ill alright!"  
“笨蛋！什么都不会出错的，而且就算有事我也在呢。你就……要是生病了就回家休息，好吗！”_

Strangely enough just reading that has made me feel a little bit better. Asuka can help me, I just have to keep believing that. She'll help me through this!  
说来也怪，光是读到这些，我就感觉好些了。明日香会帮我的，我只需坚信这一点。她会帮我度过难关的！

I don't get a chance to thank her as I feel the vibration begin in my pocket and the sound of the phone ringing. Heads in the classroom turn towards the three of us as they are aware of what is happening. It's always a strange mixture of expressions we get. A look of admiration from some and fear from others. From Kensuke there is always a look of jealousy, he doesn't understand what it is we do, he'll never understand what we go through but it's fine. I keep on telling him it isn't what he thinks but he won't listen. I guess that's alright though I'd rather he be ignorant of the truth and jealous of us then have to face the horror we do.  
我还没来得及向她道谢，就感觉到口袋里的手机开始震动，铃声响起。教室里的同学们纷纷转头看向我们三人，他们知道发生了什么。我们总是看到各种奇怪的表情混合在一起：有些人露出钦佩的神情，有些人则显得害怕。健介总是带着嫉妒的眼神，他不明白我们所做的事情，永远不会理解我们的经历，但这没关系。我一直告诉他事实并非他所想的那样，但他不听。我想这样也好，我宁愿他对真相一无所知，对我们心生嫉妒，也不愿他面对我们所经历的恐怖。

Strangely I don't feel sick as I silently rise from my desk and walk towards the exit. I'm flanked by Asuka with Ayanami behind us. I look towards Asuka and for a brief moment our gazes meet. There is something on her face, a reassuring smile. Or is that just what I want to see?  
奇怪的是，我并不感到恶心，只是默默地从桌边站起，走向出口。我被明日香和绫波丽一左一右地护着。我望向明日香，有那么一瞬，我们的目光交汇。她脸上似乎带着一丝安慰的微笑。还是那只是我希望看到的？

---

"W-Who'll be leading us, Misato is…"  
“谁……谁会带领我们，美里她……”

I already know the answer to my question but I ask just to make sure, maybe a miracle has occurred. A voice from one of the technicians confirms that I'm not quite that lucky.  
我其实已经知道答案，但还是问出口，只为确认，或许奇迹已经发生。一位技术人员的回答证实了我并没有那么幸运。

_"The Commander will be taking charge of this one."  
"指挥官将负责这次行动。"_

"My father." "我的父亲。"

I say nothing else I'm back into my seat by the Eva's launch procedures. After ten or so seconds and hundreds of metres I appear on the surface. To my left is a cliff and around me are various size rocks and boulders. It feels exactly the same as last time. I'm running out of time here, if I don't do anything then... he'll activate the dummy plug on my Eva.  
我一言不发，回到座位上，继续进行 EVA 的启动程序。十秒左右，数百米之后，我出现在地表。左边是一处悬崖，周围散布着大小不一的岩石和巨石。感觉和上次一模一样。我时间不多了，如果我不采取行动...他就会在我的 EVA 上激活模拟插头。

I know he won't even hesitate to do so, I already know it's installed in there ready for me to resist. It's almost as if he knew something like this would happen. Did he know what the Angels would be like? That one would take over an Eva like this and that I'd resist? I don't see Ayanami or Asuka having Dummy Plugs installed in their machines. Or is it just because he sees me as too weak to be able to continue fighting. Father, just what were you up to here?  
我知道他绝不会犹豫这样做，我已经感觉到那东西就装在里面，等着我反抗。仿佛他早就预料到会发生这样的事。他是否知道天使会是什么样子？知道其中一个会这样接管 Eva，而我则会反抗？我没看到绫波或明日香在她们的机体里装有模拟插入栓。还是因为他认为我太弱，无法继续战斗。父亲，你到底在这里做什么？

As if in response to my thinking about him I hear his voice over the comm channels.  
仿佛是对我想到他的回应，我通过通讯频道听到了他的声音。

_"Your target is the former Evangelion Unit 03, it has now been designated as the Thirteenth Angel."  
“你的目标是前 Eva 三号机，它现在已被指定为第十三使徒。”_

Cold and emotionless as ever. It's only now I realize he has no plan, he isn't like Misato where she would at least try to figure out a way to save the pilot and stop the Angel. He doesn't care about the pilot or he has already given up. Just like he gave up trying with me after my mother died. I thought when I was in that other place I understood him a little bit, that I wasn't angry at him but hearing his voice like I did just now. It brings it all back to me. I don't understand him, I could never understand a man like him. I hate him. I'm not going to give up on Touji, we have a few minutes left until Unit 03 arrives near Asuka. I open up a private communication channel between me and her.  
一如既往地冷漠无情。直到此刻我才意识到他毫无计划，他不像美里那样，至少会设法找出拯救驾驶员和阻止使徒的方法。他不在乎驾驶员，或者他已经放弃了。就像我母亲去世后，他对我放弃了一样。我以为在那另一个地方时，我对他有了一点理解，我不再生他的气，但听到他刚才那样的声音，所有的感觉又涌了回来。我不理解他，我永远无法理解像他这样的人。我恨他。我不会放弃对冬二的救援，我们还有几分钟时间，直到 03 号机接近明日香。我打开了一个我和她之间的私人通讯频道。

_"What is it Third, kinda busy here."  
“什么事，三号，这里有点忙。”_

"A-Asuka… Touji is in there."  
“明日香… 冬二在里面。”

_"I'm aware of that, now shut up or you'll distract me."  
"我知道了，现在闭嘴，不然你会让我分心。"_

I stumble for something to say. She isn't going to fight it is she?  
我慌乱地寻找话题。她不会要反抗吧？

"Let me join you!" "让我加入你吧！"

_"What? And let you steal my glory? No chance Third, stay where you are like a good boy. Wouldn't want to piss of your father would you?"  
"什么？让你抢了我的风头？没门，三号，乖乖待在原地别动。不想惹你爸生气吧？"_

"Asuka, my friends in there! Please let me join you up there… I can help you. I don't care about fighting the Angel I just want to make sure he is out of there. We can… we can do this together you can take the credit! Please just… let me be there with you Asuka!"  
"明日香，我的朋友们在里面！请让我加入你们……我能帮忙的。我不在乎与使徒战斗，我只希望确保它离开那里。我们可以……我们可以一起做这件事，你可以拿走功劳！请……让我和你在一起，明日香！"

There is silence for a moment before I hear a sigh, _"Fine… but you do exactly as I say. No deviating from this. I probably could handle this by myself but if you're so desperate then… whatever. If you get in any trouble though this is all your idea!"_  
沉默片刻后，我听到一声叹息，"好吧……但你得完全听我的。不许偏离。我大概能自己处理，但既然你这么急切……随你吧。不过，如果你遇到麻烦，这可都是你的主意！"

"Right." "对。"

I breathe something of a sigh of relief and feel my heart rate increase as I begin to move the Evangelion forward towards Asuka's position. As I run towards her a thought suddenly enters my mind. I'm going against what my father said, in one way it's exhilarating but at the same time I'm aware of the Dummy Plug. He wouldn't activate it yet though would he? Not while there is a chance we'll fight.  
我长舒了一口气，心跳加速，开始操控着 EVA 向明日香的位置前进。当我跑向她时，一个念头突然闪过脑海。我在违背父亲的指示，一方面这令人兴奋，但同时我也意识到了 Dummy Plug 的存在。他应该不会现在就启动它吧？在我们还有战斗机会的时候。

No voice comes over the channel as I finally get to Asuka's position. I see her standing ready as Evangelion Unit 03 walks slowly towards us. We have to be ready for this, despite its incredibly fast and agile.  
当我终于到达明日香的位置时，频道里没有传来任何声音。我看到她已经准备就绪，EVA 三号机缓缓向我们走来。我们必须做好准备，尽管它异常迅速且灵活。

It comes closer and I can see the Entry Plug sticking out of the back, held in place by the thick black tar like substance that serves as the Angel's skin.  
它越来越近，我能看到插入栓从背部伸出，被那种作为使徒皮肤的厚黑色焦油状物质固定住。

_"Okay here's the deal Third, I'm going to attack it head on and you're going to go around the back and try to restrain it. When you do I'll cut out the Entry plug, you'll deposit it somewhere safe and I'll finish it off. Deal?"  
“好吧，第三，我来正面攻击，你绕到后面设法牵制它。一旦你成功了，我就取出插入栓，你把它放到安全的地方，然后我来终结它。成交？”_

"Right." "对。"

_"And Shinji. A warning, I'm going to have to hit it and that will hurt your friend. Do not stop me. I'm sure he can take a bit of pain, just focus on what I told you to do. Got it?"  
“还有真嗣，提醒一下，我得攻击它，这会伤到你的朋友。不要阻止我。我相信他能承受一点痛苦，集中精力按我说的做。明白了吗？”_

I swallow hard at the thought of her fighting it while Touji is inside but she is right, she will have to do that. It's just… I can't do that. I can't hurt him.  
想到她在里面有东治的情况下还要战斗，我艰难地咽了口唾沫，但她是对的，她必须这么做。只是……我做不到。我不能伤害他。

"I understand." "我明白了。"

"Good, lets g-" "好，我们走——"

She's cut off as Evangelion Unit 3 jumps high into the air and with lightning speed comes down near to Asuka. Asuka swiftly ducks out of the way and its attack misses her by a whisker. I withdraw my Progressive Knife and round the back of Unit 03 and watch as Asuka withdraws her knife as well.  
话音未落，三号机跃入高空，以迅雷不及掩耳之势向明日香俯冲而来。明日香敏捷地闪避，险险躲过攻击。我收起高振动粒子刀，绕到三号机背后，同时看到明日香也拔出了她的刀。

Without warning Unit 03 darts towards her, she dodges out of the way again just as it comes to a stop exactly where she would be. I watch as its left arm starts to swing out. It would normally miss her but I know one of the tricks this Angel has up its sleeve. I yell over the comm channel.  
毫无预警地，03 号机突然向她冲去，她再次及时闪避，03 号机正好停在她原本的位置。我看着它的左臂开始挥出。通常这会错过她，但我知道这个使徒有一个诡计。我在通讯频道上大喊。

"Asuka, the arms! Watch out!"  
“明日香，注意手臂！小心！”

_"Huh?" “啊？”_

The arm swings wildly at her and begins to extend. Asuka manages to dodge backwards but enough to be missed completely. There is a loud crunch as the back of its hand catches her Evas shoulder and knocks her off balance. Scrambling to get back up it rounds on her and dives forward trying to tackle her to the ground.  
手臂疯狂地向她挥舞并开始延伸。明日香设法向后躲避，刚好完全避开。它的手背重重地击中了她的 EVA 的肩膀，使她失去平衡。她挣扎着站起来，03 号机转身向她扑去，试图将她扑倒在地。

"Asuka, No!" "明日香，不！"

I rush Unit 01 forward and watch as Unit 02 gets pinned down to the ground, immediately the Angels hand tries to go for the throat of the red Unit. Asuka tries to get her units hands into position as I hear her scream angrily over the comm channel.  
我急忙操控零一机向前冲去，只见零二机被按倒在地，天使的手立刻试图掐住红色机体的喉咙。明日香努力调整机体的双手位置，我听到她在通讯频道中愤怒地尖叫。

_"Shinji! What the hell are you doing, don't just stand there!"  
"真嗣！你到底在干什么，别光站在那儿！"_

Barely a moment later the shoulder of my Evangelion collides with the Angel knocking it to the ground. I scream out in pain as I feel the force of the blow go through my own shoulder. Within seconds we're all back on our feet again. Unit 02 is to my left, the Angel is directly in front of us.  
仅仅片刻之后，我的 Eva 肩部便与使徒相撞，将其击倒在地。我因冲击力贯穿自己的肩膀而痛苦尖叫。几秒钟内，我们全都重新站了起来。02 号机在我左侧，使徒正直面我们。

The Angel lurches forwards towards me this time. Both arms extend outwards and I react by grabbing both of them by the wrist. Out of the corner of my eye I see Unit 02 go around the back of it and begin to move forward but in my moment of distraction the Angel darts towards me and I feel its boot hit Unit 01 directly in the stomach. I cry out in pain again as the force goes into my own stomach and I immediately let go of its arms allow it to swing around and catch Unit 02 with a blow sending Asuka crashing to the ground.  
这次，使徒向我猛扑过来，双臂向外伸展，我迅速抓住它的手腕。眼角余光中，我看到 02 号机绕到它背后开始前进，但在我分神之际，使徒突然向我冲来，我感到它的靴子重重踢在 01 号机的腹部。我再次因疼痛呼喊，腹部受到冲击后立刻松开了它的手臂，使其转身一击，将明日香连同 02 号机一并击倒在地。

It turns to face me again and reaches out one of its hands to grab Unit 01 by the skull. I don't resist it grabbing me, not out of choice but because I'm too winded by the kick to be able to react. Pain shoots through my head as it smashes the head of my Evangelion into the nearest rock. It repeats the movement a second time and my ears fill with the sickening sound of metal on rock. A third time occurs and this is the most painful one, I feel it slam the head of the Eva against the rock and scrape it against.  
它再次转向我，伸出一只手抓住 01 号的头骨。我没有反抗它的抓握，并非出于选择，而是因为那一脚让我喘不过气来，无法做出反应。当它将我的福音战士的头猛击到最近的岩石上时，疼痛贯穿我的头部。它重复了这个动作第二次，我的耳朵里充满了金属与岩石碰撞的令人作呕的声音。第三次发生时，这是最痛苦的，我能感觉到它将 Eva 的头猛击并刮擦在岩石上。

I scream out this time as I feel every movement of the Eva's head against the rocky surface. My forehead burns with pain, the bridge of my nose reacts to it and I feel a warm liquid trickle down my cheek where I'm sure I've been cut open.  
这一次我尖叫起来，因为我能感受到 Eva 的头每一次撞击岩石表面的动作。我的额头疼痛难忍，鼻梁对此也有反应，我感觉到一股温热的液体顺着脸颊流下，我确信那里已经被割开了。

_"Shinji, why aren't you fighting?"  
“真嗣，你为什么不反抗？”_

I hear his voice over the communication channel.  
我听到他在通讯频道里的声音。

"I… I'm… argh" "我……我……啊"

My head is smashed against the rock a fourth time, "I'm… trying…"  
我的头第四次撞在岩石上，“我……在……努力……”

In response to not having my head smashed against the rock a fifth time and also just for him I manage to catch my breath and react this time. I lean the Eva's head forward and bring the arms up to the Angels wrists and start to force it off of me. In the back I see a flash of red as Asuka dives forward and grabs the Angel around the arms and throws it off of me.  
由于没有第五次被头撞岩石，也因为仅仅是为了他，我这次得以喘息并做出反应。我将 Eva 的头向前倾，抬起双臂扣住天使的手腕，开始用力将其推开。在后方，我看到一道红光闪过，是明日香冲上前，抱住天使的双臂，将它从我身上甩开。

She extends a hand to me and helps me up.  
她向我伸出手，扶我起身。

_"Right. Nothing like a good challenge eh Shinji?"  
“对啊，没有什么比一场好挑战更棒了，对吧，真嗣？”_

She dives towards the Angel with her knife out, "No Asuka!"  
她持刀向使徒冲去，"不，明日香！"

"Idiot, I told you not to distra-"  
"白痴，我告诉过你不要分散注意——"

Too late, the distraction causes the Angel to bring its arms forward and stop Unit 02 in its tracks. I look on as I hear Asuka cry out in pain from the choking. It slowly lifts Unit 02 up until it's just off the ground. For a moment I look on horrified, I feel like I've seen this before but I'm quickly snapped out of it by my father's voice.  
太迟了，分心使得使徒挥臂向前，阻止了 02 号机的行动。我眼睁睁看着明日香因窒息而痛苦呼喊。使徒缓缓将 02 号机举起，直到离地。那一刻我惊恐万分，感觉似曾相识，但很快被父亲的喊声拉回现实。

_"What are you doing? Go and fight it! That is an order!"  
"你在干什么？去战斗！这是命令！"_

I hear Asuka let out another scream as I see the two of them and feel the Progressive Knife in my Eva's hand. If I don't do something, he'll activate it but… I can't but… it's hurting Asuka… it's hurting the person I love. I watch as the black substance on it begins to crawl up its arm and towards Unit 02. Asuka lets out another scream of pain and struggles at the Angels arms to try to break free. I can hear the comm chatter.  
我听到明日香再次尖叫，同时看到他们俩，感受到我 Eva 手中的渐进之刃。如果我不采取行动，他会启动它，但是……我不能……它在伤害明日香……它在伤害我爱的人。我看着那黑色物质开始沿着它的手臂爬向 02 号机。明日香发出另一声痛苦的尖叫，挣扎着试图从天使的手臂中挣脱。我能听到通讯中的嘈杂声。

_"Sir it's infecting Unit 02… shall we eject the pilot."  
"长官，它在感染 02 号机……我们要弹射驾驶员吗？"_

_"No, not yet. Shinji do something!"  
“不，还没有。真嗣，做点什么！”_

I slowly stagger to my feet and fix my eyes forward. Anything I do now will be nothing compared to what will happen if I do nothing. I don't want to hurt Touji but he could die and Asuka could be seriously hurt too. I can't let it hurt Asuka because of me, I won't let Asuka be hurt because of me! I love her too much to watch her be hurt.  
我缓缓地站起身，目光坚定地向前看。现在我做的任何事都无法与什么都不做可能发生的后果相比。我不想伤害冬二，但他可能会死，明日香也可能受重伤。我不能因为自己而让明日香受伤，我不会因为自己而让明日香受伤！我爱她太深，不能看着她受伤。

I'm sorry Touji. 对不起，冬二。

I let out a scream and dive forward with the knife clutched tightly. It feels like an eternity but eventually cross that gap between myself and the Angel. I dive forward and plunge the knife deeply into its shoulder. It howls in pain, I scream in rage as I see the blood spray from its shoulder. It releases its grip on Unit 02 as both my Eva and the Angel fall to the floor. I pull the arm back and deliver a punch directly to the cheek of the Eva. As it pushes forward and rolls me onto my back.  
我发出一声尖叫，紧握着刀猛地向前扑去。仿佛经历了一个世纪般漫长，最终跨越了我和使徒之间的距离。我向前一跃，将刀深深刺入它的肩膀。它痛苦地嚎叫，我则在愤怒中尖叫，眼见鲜血从它的肩膀喷涌而出。它松开了对二号机的抓握，我和使徒一同跌落在地。我抽回手臂，狠狠地朝使徒的脸颊打去。它推搡着前进，将我翻滚在地。

I can feel its arms scrambling for my throat but I keep moving and holding it in position. Behind it I can see Unit 02 looming overhead. It has its knife ready as I pull the Angel towards me trying to hold its squirming body in place. She attacks with precision, her knife tearing through the black substance covering the Entry Plug on the Angels back.  
我能感觉到它的手臂在拼命掐向我的喉咙，但我不断移动，保持它的位置。在它身后，我看到二号机高高耸立。它已准备好刀，我则试图将使徒拉向我，努力固定住它扭动的身躯。她精准地发起攻击，刀刃撕裂了覆盖在使徒背部插入栓上的黑色物质。

The Angel howls out in pain with each time Asuka cuts through a strand of it. It squirms more and more rapidly as finally she cuts away the last piece and the Entry Plug shoots out, crashing on the floor some distance away. With the Entry Plug gone I let go of the Angel and smash a fist into its face as I watch Asuka bring Unit 02s knife down upon its back.  
每次明日香切断它的一根触须，使徒便痛苦地嚎叫。它扭动得越来越快，直到明日香终于切断了最后一根，插入栓猛地弹出，撞在远处的地板上。插入栓消失后，我松开使徒，一拳砸向它的脸，同时看着明日香用二号机的刀劈向它的背部。

I scramble out of the way as the Angel tries to get itself up off the ground but it kicked back down by Asuka. Unit 02s left foot hits the Angel in the chest just narrowly above the core, the reels back and kicks it again and then a third time. I watch on letting Asuka finish it off and watch satisfied as she brings her knife down on the Angels core. With minimal effort the blade cuts through the core and the Angel falls silent.  
使徒试图从地上爬起来，我急忙闪开，却被明日香一脚踢回。二号机的左脚正好踩在使徒胸口，略高于核心位置，然后她收回脚再次猛踢，接着是第三次。我站在一旁，看着明日香结束这一切，满意地看着她将刀刃刺入使徒的核心。刀刃轻松贯穿核心，使徒随即静止不动。

_"We're able to get a reading on the Entry Plug again, life signs are stable. Pilot has suffered injuries to the shoulder and chest region but aside from that everything appears to be okay."  
我们再次检测到插入栓的信号，生命体征稳定。驾驶员肩部和胸部受伤，但除此之外一切正常。_

My father gives a blunt response, _"And the Angel?"_  
我父亲直截了当地回答，“那使徒呢？”

_"No response, Magi are reporting it as destroyed."  
“没有回应，魔术师们报告说它已经被摧毁了。”_

I breathe a sigh of relief and look across at Unit 02 now standing and putting its progressive knife away. We did it, thank you Asuka.  
我松了一口气，望向现在站立并收起高频振动刀的二号机。我们做到了，谢谢你，明日香。

---

The Entry Plug opens up and I climb outside and nearly lose my footing. I feel incredibly dizzy, probably a lack of food and the blood loss. I don't care, I stagger past the technicians working on my Entry Plug and see Asuka stood alone next to her Eva. She looks at me and without warning I throw myself at her wrapping my arms around her tightly.  
插入栓打开，我爬了出来，差点没站稳。感觉非常晕眩，大概是饥饿和失血的缘故。我不在乎，踉跄着走过正在检修我的插入栓的技术人员，看到明日香独自站在她的 EVA 旁边。她看着我，没等她反应过来，我就扑向她，紧紧抱住她。

"What are you-" "你在干什么——"

I let out a loud sob as I cry into her shoulder, I don't let go of her as I feel the tears roll down my face. She doesn't push me off of her but I can feel her arms not quite moving around me, I don't care I need to hold her. I need to thank her. She did it, she really did it. She saved him and helped me.  
我把头埋在她的肩膀上，放声大哭，泪水顺着脸颊滑落，我紧紧抱住她没有松手。她没有推开我，但我能感觉到她的手臂并没有完全环绕住我，我不在乎，我需要抱住她。我需要感谢她。她做到了，她真的做到了。她救了他，也帮了我。

"You… you're crying? How disgusting."  
“你……你在哭吗？真恶心。”

For a moment I freeze up at hearing her say that. I've heard those words before and when I look up I half expect to see her as she was that day, wearing the bandages but when I do look at her I actually see something else. She's actually smiling.  
听到她这么说，我一时愣住了。这些话我曾听过，抬头时我甚至半期待着看到那天她缠着绷带的样子，但当我真的看向她时，却看到了另一番景象。她竟然在微笑。

"I can't believe you're crying, what sort of man are you?"  
“我真不敢相信你在哭，你算什么男人？”

I bury my head into her shoulder and apologize as best I can through my sobs. I think I manage to get out a thank you. After a moment I feel her arms close around me.  
我把头埋进她的肩膀，尽量在抽泣中道歉。我想我勉强说出了谢谢。过了一会儿，我感到她的手臂环抱住了我。

"I'll allow it I guess."  
"我想我可以允许这样。"

We stand there for a while holding each other, I actually feel her rest her head on my shoulder as well and I wonder if she is actually enjoying this as well. I feel the tears stop eventually and pull away to wipe my eyes and notice a red stain on my plugsuit.  
我们站在那里相拥了一会儿，我感觉到她真的把头靠在了我的肩膀上，不禁猜想她是否也在享受这一刻。最终，泪水止住了，我抽身出来擦了擦眼睛，注意到我的驾驶服上有一块红色污渍。

"You're bleeding… gross, I hope you didn't get too many tears or blood on my plugsuit."  
"你在流血……真恶心，希望我的驾驶服上没沾太多眼泪或血。"

I laugh weakly, "S-Sorry… I… you did it Asuka, you… you're amazing… you're perfect, you really are. Thank you."  
我虚弱地笑笑，“对-对不起……我……你做到了，明日香，你……你太了不起了……你完美无缺，真的。谢谢你。”

She looks like she is about to respond when we're interrupted by a man in a suit, I've seen him before. One of the Agents from Section 2. We rarely have any contact with Section 2, the only reason I recognize this man is because he is one of the people who brought me back when I ran away from Misato's.  
她看起来正要回应，却被一个穿西装的男人打断了，我以前见过他。是第二分部的一名特工。我们很少与第二分部有接触，我能认出这个人是因为他是我逃离美里家时带我回来的其中一人。

"Pilot Sohyru, Pilot Ikari please come with me. The Commander has requested your presence."  
“碇司令，绫波零，请跟我来。指挥官要求见你们。”

---

As we enter the office of my father I feel my heart pounding in my chest. I don't understand why we've been summoned here, we beat the Angel didn't we? What could he want. At least it isn't like it was the last time, at least I'm not handcuffed and at least I have Asuka here with me. I sneak a glance at her as we enter the room. I've rarely seen her look nervous but this is one of those times. I guess my father has that effect on people. It doesn't help that his office is dimly lit, has some large symbol on the floor and appears to be a lot larger than it has to be. If it wasn't for the fact that it scared me I'd probably say this was stupid.  
当我踏入父亲的办公室时，我的心在胸腔里狂跳。我不明白为什么我们被召集到这里，我们不是已经击败了使徒吗？他到底想要什么。至少不像上次那样，至少我没有被铐住，而且至少有明日香在这里陪我。我们走进房间时，我偷偷瞥了她一眼。我很少见她显得紧张，但这次就是其中之一。我想我父亲就是有那种影响人的能力。再加上他的办公室灯光昏暗，地板上有个巨大的符号，而且似乎比实际需要的要大得多，这并没有帮助。如果不是因为它吓到了我，我可能会说这很愚蠢。

As we enter the Section 2 man behind us bows at my father and leaves the room. I can already feel my fathers piercing glare from behind his glasses. Fuyutsuki on the other hand doesn't give off the same feeling of intimidation.  
当我们进入第二支部时，跟在我们身后的男子向父亲鞠了一躬，然后离开了房间。我已经能感受到父亲透过眼镜的锐利目光。而另一方面，冬月并没有散发出同样的威慑感。

"Why did you both disobey my orders?"  
“你们俩为什么违抗我的命令？”

My father speaks, his tone no different than it usually is. If it was Misato or Fuyutsuki asking us we'd be able to get some sense of their feelings towards the question. We'd be able to pick up anger or annoyance but no such thing with my father. If anything it feels like he's inconvenienced by having to do this.  
父亲开口了，语气与往常无异。如果是美里或冬月老师问我们，我们或许能从他们的情绪中感受到些什么。我们能察觉到愤怒或不悦，但父亲却毫无此类迹象。如果说有什么感觉的话，他似乎因为不得不这么做而感到不便。

I bow my head not knowing how to answer, thankfully Asuka speaks up.  
我低头不知如何作答，幸好明日香开口了。

"Commander?" “指挥官？”

"I gave you all very specific instructions. You were to be positioned apart from each other in order to engage the Angel. Why did you disobey that order?"  
“我给了你们非常明确的指示。你们应该各自分散站位，以便迎战使徒。为什么违抗那个命令？”

I look at Asuka just as she looks at me, I step forward. It was my idea so I should take responsibility for it. Asuka had nothing to do with this.  
我看着明日香，她也正看着我，我向前迈了一步。这是我的主意，所以我应该为此负责。明日香与此无关。

"Father I ca-" "父亲，我……"

"It was my idea." "这是我的主意。"

I'm cut off by Asuka as she steps beside me.  
我被明日香打断了，她走到我身边。

"We knew little about the Angel only that it had taken over Evangelion Unit 03 and that there was a pilot trapped inside. Knowing that the American branch had possibly given Unit 03 some upgrades over what we currently fight with I made the request for Shinji to come to my position to engage the Angel with me as a back up."  
我们对使徒知之甚少，只知道它占领了 EVA 三号机，并且里面有一位驾驶员被困。考虑到美国分部可能对三号机进行了一些我们目前所不具备的升级，我请求真嗣前来支援，与我一同作为后备力量对抗使徒。

"You focused heavily on freeing the pilot first rather than engaging the Angel?"  
你更侧重于先救出驾驶员，而不是直接对抗使徒？

"Yes sir, I wanted to make sure the pilot was free first before killing the Angel."  
"是的，先生，我想先确保驾驶员安全，然后再消灭使徒。"

"You know what your priority is don't you?"  
"你知道你的首要任务是什么，对吧？"

"Defeating the Angels sir, but I felt that given the resources we have and some of the problems that have presented themselves with both this and the previous Angel losing a valuable resource like a pilot was something that should be prevented."  
"击败使徒，先生，但考虑到我们现有的资源以及这次和上次使徒出现时遇到的一些问题，我认为失去像驾驶员这样宝贵的资源是应该避免的。"

She pauses as I look her up and down. I've never heard Asuka talk this formally before, it's like she is a different person but I guess she has to act like this with my father. He is the Commander.  
她停顿了一下，当我上下打量她时。我从未听过明日香如此正式地说话，她仿佛变成了另一个人，但我想她在我父亲面前必须这样表现。他是指挥官。

"Why did you now confirm your actions with us first?"  
“为什么你现在才向我们确认你的行动？”

"I felt we had to act quickly, so I took matters into my own hands. I felt that given my experience and training I was capable of handling this. I am willing to accept any punishment you feel is necessary."  
“我觉得我们必须迅速行动，所以我自行其是。考虑到我的经验和训练，我认为自己能够处理好这件事。我愿意接受你们认为必要的任何惩罚。”

A silence falls around us as I suddenly become engrossed in the plant at the far end of the room. Is that new? I don't know, maybe Fuyutsuki brought it in to brighten up the place. I turn towards the desk again and see my father say something quietly to Fuyutsuki. I look at Asuka, her eyes are fixed firmly forward but I can see sweat trickling down her forehead. After what feels like an eternity Fuyutsuki finally speaks.  
一阵沉默笼罩在我们周围，我突然全神贯注于房间尽头的那株植物。那是新来的吗？我不清楚，或许是冬月带进来为这里增添些生气。我再次转向桌子，看到父亲正低声对冬月说着什么。我看向明日香，她的目光坚定地直视前方，但我能看见汗水正顺着她的额头滑落。仿佛过了一个世纪，冬月终于开口了。

"There will be no punishment. Our priority is to defeat the Angels at any cost and that is exactly what happened. Thanks to your quick thinking Pilot Sohryu we were also able to spare the life of Pilot Suzahara which as you say could benefit us in the future. I will however caution you both to not take matters into your own hands in the future. There is a reason we have a bridge crew and that is to calculate and assess strategies to give to you both. Please keep in mind the importance of that communication going forward."  
“不会有任何惩罚。我们的首要任务是以任何代价击败使徒，而这正是发生的事情。多亏了你的机智，飞行员惣流，我们还能保住飞行员铃原的性命，正如你所说，这可能在未来对我们有利。但我必须告诫你们两位，今后不要擅自行动。我们有桥员团队是有原因的，那就是计算和评估策略，然后传达给你们。请记住，今后保持这种沟通的重要性。”

Communication? From them? I might actually laugh if I could.  
沟通？从他们那里？如果我能的话，我可能会笑出声来。

"Yes sir." "是，长官。"

I follow Asuka with a 'yes sir' of my own and we both leave the room and both of us sigh a breathe of relief on entering the brightly lit corridor. My eyes barely have time to adjust before Asuka spins around and pushes me up against the wall. She scowls at me but her eyes seem to lack any of that anger.  
我跟着明日香，也用一声‘是的，长官’回应，我们俩一起离开了房间，进入明亮的走廊时都松了一口气。我的眼睛还没来得及适应光线，明日香就突然转身将我推到墙上。她皱着眉头盯着我，但眼神中似乎并没有怒意。

She's beautiful, even now as she's covered in sweat, still in her plugsuit, covered in LCL and pinning me up against the wall. Especially the last part she's beautiful. I resist the urge to place my hands on her sides and instead wait for her to speak.  
她很美，即使现在满身是汗，仍然穿着插入栓服，浑身沾满 LCL，将我按在墙上。尤其是最后这一点，她显得格外美丽。我忍住了把手放在她腰间的冲动，而是等待她开口。

"You owe me." “你欠我的。”

I nod my head, "I... I do, thank you. I'll... umm, dinner? Tonight? I'll book a place this time?"  
我点点头，“我……我愿意，谢谢。我……呃，晚餐？今晚？这次我会预订地方的。”

She shakes her head, "No, not dinner tonight. Tonight we're visiting Misato in hospital, tomorrow night you're taking me to a concert in town. You will purchase the tickets after we're done showering. You will mention you are with NERV and that will secure us seats on the first few rows, how do I know this you ask? I already checked."  
她摇摇头，“不，今晚不是晚餐。今晚我们要去医院看望美里，明晚你要带我去城里听音乐会。洗完澡后你就去买票。你要提到你是 NERV 的，这样我们就能坐在前排，你怎么知道这些？我事先查过了。”

She lets go of me but then pushes a finger into my chest, "You will dress smartly for this occasion and while we are out you will buy me one piece of merchandise that I want. Don't worry, it'll only be a T-Shirt. You will also be sure to hold my hand to and from the venue? Do you understand me?"  
她放开我，但随即用手指戳了戳我的胸口，“你要为这次活动穿得体面些，而且在外面时，你要买一件我想要的商品。别担心，只是一件 T 恤。你还要确保在去和离开会场时牵着我的手，明白吗？”

I nod my head, I have no problem with those terms at all. She didn't have to ask about any of it. I'd have happily done that anyway.  
我点点头，对这些条件完全没有异议。她其实不必问的。无论如何，我都会乐意这么做。

"Good, the concert is for helping you save your friend. The T-Shirt is for me having to face your father and this... this is because I like you."  
“好，音乐会是为了帮你救朋友。T 恤是因为我得面对你父亲，而这个...这个是因为我喜欢你。”

She leans in and kisses me on the cheek before turning and walking down the corridor towards her locker room.  
她倾身在我脸颊上轻轻一吻，然后转身沿着走廊走向她的更衣室。

### Chapter 14 Catalyst
**Day Five 第五天**

I don't think I'll ever be happy again. I don't think I'll ever smile again. I don't think I'll ever laugh again. I don't think I'll ever feel alive again. All there is now is numbness as I stand over his body and look at his peaceful form. He's been this way for a five now, hooked up to an array of devices monitoring his body. His chest rising and falling slowly.  
我想我再也不会快乐了。我想我再也不会微笑了。我想我再也不会笑了。我想我再也不会感到活着了。现在只有麻木，我站在他的身体旁，看着他平静的模样。他已经这样五天了，连接着各种监测他身体的设备。他的胸膛缓慢地起伏着。

Every so often a nurse or Fuyutsuki will enter the room to check his vitals, they'll run a test or take some blood or whatever it is they do and they'll leave. They won't speak to me anymore. They gave up on speaking to me three days ago when they realized I wasn't going to respond.  
每隔一段时间，护士或冬月会进入房间检查他的生命体征，他们会进行测试或抽血，或者做他们该做的事，然后离开。他们不再和我说话。三天前，他们意识到我不会回应，就放弃了和我交谈。

That's alright though. I don't want to speak to them and they shouldn't want to speak to me. After all this is my fault. I'm the reason for Shinji being in this state. I'm the reason he nearly bled out on that street. I'm the reason they had to perform emergency surgery to remove the bullet fragments from deep within his body. I'm the reason Misato cries at night.  
不过没关系。我不想和他们说话，他们也不应该想和我说话。毕竟这都是我的错。我是让真嗣陷入这种状态的原因。我是让他差点在那条街上失血过多的人。我是让他们不得不进行紧急手术取出他体内深处的子弹碎片的人。我是让美里在夜晚哭泣的人。

I failed him and I failed myself. I made a promise that I'd protect him no matter what. I made a promise to make him happy so that I could make up for what a wretched human being I've been. I made a promise that I'd love him like he loves me. It wasn't a game and it wasn't a prank. I loved Shinji Ikari, I really fucking loved him. I gave myself to him, my body and my heart and I was happy.  
我辜负了他，也辜负了自己。我曾许诺无论如何都要保护他。我承诺要让他幸福，以此弥补我作为一个可悲人类的过错。我承诺会像他爱我一样爱他。这不是游戏，也不是恶作剧。我爱碇真嗣，我真的他妈的爱他。我把自己交给了他，我的身体和心灵，我感到幸福。

Yet as is the story in my miserable life just at the point in which I was happiest I've had it torn away from me. When I lost Eva I thought I had lost everything but then I found out something about my mother. I regained Eva for just a time only to lose it again. I had nothing when I entered Instrumentality but then I found out he was calling for me, he loved me and needed me and I realized I loved and needed him too. I had a purpose again.  
然而，在我悲惨的人生中，就在我感到最幸福的时刻，这一切又被夺走了。当我失去 Eva 时，我以为我失去了所有，但后来我得知了一些关于我母亲的事情。我短暂地重新获得了 Eva，却又再次失去。当我进入人类补完计划时，我一无所有，但后来我发现他在呼唤我，他爱我，需要我，我意识到我也爱他，需要他。我再次找到了生活的意义。

Yet in the end I failed and it's all my fault. If I hadn't have ran away like that this wouldn't have happened. We'd have been safe in our room right now. We'd have been screwing each other's brains out right now. That's one of the worst things about this, lying alone in our bed at night wishing for him to be next to me. Wishing for me to be able to climb on top of him. Wishing that I could hear him moan my name. Wishing that I could hold him when I climaxed. Yet I can't and all I'm left with is a sick feeling in my stomach and staring at my soiled hand.  
然而最终我失败了，一切都是我的错。如果我没有那样逃跑，这一切就不会发生。我们现在本该安全地待在房间里。我们现在本该在疯狂地互相索取。这是最糟糕的部分之一，独自躺在我们的床上，夜里渴望他在我身边。渴望我能爬到他身上。渴望能听到他呻吟我的名字。渴望在我高潮时能抱住他。然而我做不到，留给我的只有胃里的恶心感和凝视着脏手的自己。

"Miss Sohryu?" “草薙小姐？”

I don't turn to greet the person who has entered the room. I think it's a nurse, I don't know which one and I don't care.  
我没有转身迎接进入房间的人。我想是个护士，不知道是哪一个，我也不在乎。

"I'm sorry Miss Sohryu but I'm going to have to ask you to leave… we need to close up. You can come back tomorrow."  
“抱歉，草薙小姐，我不得不请您离开……我们得打烊了。您明天可以再来。”

Without saying a word I turn and leave the room. I can feel her sympathetic stare on me as I leave. I feel like telling her to not bother. I don't deserve any sympathy.  
我一言不发地转身离开房间。我能感觉到她同情的目光在我离开时一直注视着我。我几乎想告诉她不必如此。我不配得到任何同情。

**Day Six 第六天**

The door to my Entry Plug opens and the daylight streams in and across my face. All I can feel is pain running throughout my body. The Angel has been defeated and I… I did nothing. I couldn't do anything against it. All I could do was freeze up as I felt it bore its way into my mind. I feel sick and violated. I feel a pair of arms reach into the plug and pull me out.  
我的插入栓门打开了，阳光倾泻而入，洒在我的脸上。全身只感到一阵阵剧痛。使徒已被击败，而我……我什么也没做。面对它，我无能为力。只能僵在那里，任由它侵入我的心灵。我感到恶心和被侵犯。一双臂膀伸进插入栓，将我拉了出来。

I'm placed on the ground and immediately lose my balance and fall forward. My vision is blurred but I can make out a blurred arm clad in a yellow hazmat suit grab me and stop me from falling flat on my face. I can hear someone mumble something about contamination and I'm sat down on a piece of flat ground as the two people in their hazmat suits wander away from me.  
我被放在地上，立刻失去了平衡，向前倒去。视线模糊，但能看到一只穿着黄色防化服的手臂抓住了我，阻止我脸朝下摔倒。我听到有人咕哝着关于污染的话，然后我被安置在一块平坦的地面上，那两个穿着防化服的人从我身边走开。

Heh… contaminated. I suppose that makes sense, not content with violating it's also left something inside me and now no one can come near me. I just have to sit here all alone, well that's fine. I don't need anyone. I don't need them. I don't need… I bite my lip to stop the tears from forming in my eyes. I promised I wouldn't cry and I'm not about to do it now. I pull my knees up to my chest and wrap my arms around them.  
呵……被污染了。想来也合理，不仅侵犯了心灵，还留下了什么在我体内，现在没人能靠近我。我只能独自坐在这里，好吧，没关系。我不需要任何人。我不需要他们。我不需要……我咬住嘴唇，阻止泪水在眼眶中形成。我承诺过不会哭泣，现在也不会。我抱紧膝盖，将它们拉到胸前。

It shown me everything, everything I hate about myself. Everything that has happened to me in my life. It shown me what I had become, and peeled back all the layers of my soul revealing what I really was. Just a frightened little girl trying to act big. In a matter of seconds it brought the safe and secure wall I had built up around myself tumbling down. I feel sick.  
它向我展示了所有，所有我厌恶自己的地方。我生命中发生的一切。它向我展示了我已经变成了什么，剥开了我灵魂的所有层面，揭示了我真正的样子。只是一个试图装作强大的害怕的小女孩。在几秒钟内，它让我围绕自己建立的安全堡垒轰然倒塌。我感觉恶心。

In the distance I can see Unit 00 being pulled back into the ground. I was saved by Wondergirl, fucking amazing. I was… I was… I fucking hate this. I hate it. I hate it so damn much. I hate them all.  
在远处，我看到零号机被拖回地下。我被明日香救了，真是他妈的神奇。我……我……我他妈的讨厌这个。我讨厌它。我讨厌它到了极点。我讨厌他们所有人。

"Asuka… " "“明日香……”

The voice snaps me to attention for a moment. Stupid Shinji has turned up, and where was he during all of this? Nowhere, that's where he was. He didn't even try, he just sat in his Eva and watched it all happen. Watched as I was violated and humiliated for the world to see.  
那声音让我瞬间回过神来。愚蠢的真嗣出现了，他在这期间又在哪里？无处可寻，他就是那样。他甚至没有尝试，只是坐在他的 Eva 里，看着这一切发生。看着我被侵犯和羞辱，让全世界都目睹。

"Are you alright?" “你还好吗？”

"Do I look like I'm alright, just go away. Idiot."  
“我看起来像没事吗，走开。白痴。”

"I… I'm sorry." “我……对不起。”

I stand up and turn to face him, "You're sorry… you're fucking sorry? Idiot, just fuck off. You have no idea do you."  
我站起身，转身面对他，“你道歉……你他妈的道歉？白痴，滚一边去。你根本不知道，对吧。”

He bows his head but stands his ground on the outside of the barrier. Part of me wants to rush over there and slap him and beat him to a pulp. Another part of me wants nothing more than for him to break through the barrier and hold me. Why won't you hold me Shinji? Why can't you see I'm hurting here?  
他低下头，但仍坚守在屏障外。我的一部分想冲过去扇他耳光，把他打成肉酱。另一部分却只希望他能突破屏障，紧紧抱住我。为什么你不抱我，真嗣？为什么你看不到我在这里受伤？

My visions returned to normal and I can see the caution tape set out around me. He's standing about three metres away and is as close to the tape as is possible. He's still wearing his plugsuit and we're the only two people up here. I guess no one else wanted to be near me. Of course if it was Shinji or Wondergirl they'd all be flocking to their side. No one gives a damn about the piece of shit called Asuka. Except for this idiot in front of me.  
我的视野恢复正常，可以看到周围拉起的警戒线。他站在大约三米外，尽可能靠近警戒线。他仍穿着插入栓服，这里只有我们两个人。我想没人愿意靠近我。当然，如果是真嗣或奇迹少女，他们都会蜂拥而至。没人会在乎被称为明日香的这个废物。除了我面前的这个傻瓜。

I take a step towards him and I screw up my hand in a fist. To his credit he doesn't move as I continue to move towards him. I get closer and he looks me in the eye as I bring my fist back. I push it forward but without any warning he catches it and pulls me towards him wrapping his arms around me tightly and pulling me towards the barrier.  
我向他迈出一步，握紧拳头。值得称赞的是，当我继续向他靠近时，他并没有动。我越来越近，他直视着我的眼睛，我收回拳头。我向前一推，但没有预警，他抓住了我的手，紧紧地用双臂环抱住我，将我拉向障碍物。

"Asuka… I'm so sorry… they… they wouldn't let me do anything. They kept me in there and… I tried but they wouldn't let me…"  
“明日香……我很抱歉……他们……他们不让我做任何事。他们把我关在里面，我……我试过了，但他们不让我……”

He's actually holding me, in an instant the anger drains from me and I feel like a little girl that's being held by their mother after falling down in the playground. I wrap my arms around him and snuggle my head into his shoulder and whisper, "Idiot. They think I'm contaminated… aren't you worried about getting into trouble?"  
他真的在抱着我，一瞬间怒气消散，我感觉自己像个在游乐场上摔倒后被母亲抱起的小女孩。我环抱住他，把头埋进他的肩膀，低声说：“傻瓜。他们认为我被污染了……你不怕惹上麻烦吗？”

He only holds me tighter, "I don't care. They can quarantine me as well if they want… I love you Asuka."  
他只是将我抱得更紧，“我不在乎。如果他们愿意，也可以把我隔离起来……我爱你，明日香。”

I'm surprised by his boldness and his words but I can't help but smile, "Shinji I… I love you to-"  
他的大胆和话语让我惊讶，但我忍不住微笑，“真嗣，我……我也爱你——”

A loud sound echoes throughout the air and I feel his body go limp against mine. What… what is this? No… this can't be… this… not after what just happened to me. I reach up with my hand and pull it away to see the blood stains on my gloved hand. I feel his body slump against mine and look around frantically.  
一声巨响在空中回荡，我感到他的身体在我怀里瘫软下来。这……这是怎么回事？不……这不可能……这……在我刚刚经历那一切之后。我伸手扯下手套，看到上面的血迹。我感到他的身体在我身上瘫倒，慌乱地环顾四周。

I scream. 我尖叫。

**Day Six - 0430 第六天 - 0430**

My eyes flicker open and I'm immediately met with an immense pain in my lower stomach. Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I have a nightmare combining two of my worst memories and wake up to start my period. I climb out of bed to go and sort myself out and stumble as another pain goes through me. Fucking stupid cramps, why do I always have to suffer with them this much.  
我的眼睛猛地睁开，立刻感到下腹部传来剧烈的疼痛。就在我以为情况不可能更糟的时候，我做了一个噩梦，结合了我最糟糕的两段记忆，醒来时发现自己来了月经。我爬下床去整理自己，却又因另一阵疼痛而踉跄。该死的痛经，为什么我总是要承受这么多痛苦。

I stagger into the bathroom with the memory of the dream still fresh in my memory. It almost feels like I can see sense his weight on me as his body slumped against mine. If I look at my hand I can almost see the bloodstain.  
我踉跄着走进浴室，梦境的记忆依旧鲜明。仿佛还能感受到他压在我身上的重量，他的身体瘫倒在我身上。如果我看着自己的手，几乎能看到那血迹。

I do what I need to in the bathroom and finish up my splashing water on my face. I look up at myself in the mirror. I'm met with a pale face, heavy bags under my eyes and a gaunt expression. I've barely slept since he was shot. I was never a good sleeper as it was, until I started to share a bed with him. Just him being nearby helped me to sleep. Now it's back to the mixture of nightmares and coupled with these cramps I don't think I'll be getting anymore sleep tonight.  
我在浴室里完成了必要的动作，最后用冷水泼了泼脸。我抬头看向镜子中的自己。映入眼帘的是一张苍白的脸，眼下的黑眼圈沉重，神情憔悴。自从他中枪后，我几乎没怎么睡过。原本我就不是个好睡的人，直到我开始和他同床共枕。仅仅是他在附近就能帮我入睡。现在又回到了噩梦连连的状态，加上这些抽痛，我想今晚我不会再有睡眠了。

I decide that I'll go and see him. I don't care if they don't want any visitors in there, I can't stay in this room for the rest of tonight.  
我决定去见他。我不在乎他们是否不希望有人探访，我无法在这个房间里度过今晚的剩余时间。

I throw on some pyjamas, usually I'll sleep in just my panties and a loose t-shirt, or if Shinji is lucky just my panties. I always got too warm in pyjamas but if I'm leaving the room it's probably for the best I put some on. After I'm dressed I put on my shoes and slip out of the room and head for the elevator.  
我套上睡衣，通常我只穿内裤和宽松 T 恤睡觉，或者如果真嗣运气好的话，只穿内裤。我总是觉得穿睡衣太热，但如果我要离开房间，穿上它可能是最好的选择。穿好衣服后，我穿上鞋子，悄悄走出房间，朝电梯走去。

A few minutes later after passing through the deserted corridors I enter the medical wing. I had hoped it'd be empty but unfortunately I'm greeted by the surprised look of Fuyutsuki as I enter the room.  
几分钟后，穿过空无一人的走廊，我进入了医疗翼。我本希望那里空无一人，但不幸的是，我一进门就看到了副司令冬月那惊讶的表情。

"Asuka, are you alright?"  
“明日香，你还好吗？”

I decide I'm finally going to have to speak, "I… period cramps, I need painkillers…"  
我决定终于得开口了，“我……经期痛，需要止痛药……”

I feel myself blush as I ask for painkillers. It's so stupid that even I get embarrassed by that sort of thing. Thankfully Fuyutsuki doesn't ask any questions and goes to a cabinet.  
我感到自己脸红了，因为问止痛药而感到尴尬。这种事连我自己都觉得蠢。幸好冬月没有多问，直接走向一个柜子。

"Of course." "当然可以。"

I wander through the door to Shinjis room and I see two chairs set out. I lay myself down on them and pull my knees up to my chest. A moment later Fuyutsuki enters the room and looks down at me, he hands me a glass of water and tablet. I sit up and take the tablet gently sipping at the water.  
我穿过门进入真嗣的房间，看到里面摆了两把椅子。我躺倒在椅子上，把膝盖蜷缩到胸前。不一会儿，冬月走进房间，低头看着我，递给我一杯水和一片药。我坐起身，轻轻抿着水吞下了药片。

"Asuka you can't stay here."  
“明日香，你不能留在这儿。”

I lie back down and ignore him. If he doesn't want me here he'll have to forcibly remove me and if he lays a finger on me I'm going to put up a fight.  
我重新躺下，不理会他。如果他不想让我待在这里，那就得强行把我赶走；只要他敢碰我一下，我就会奋起反抗。

Instead of trying to convince me he looks at Shinji and then back to me. Then he surprises me with what he says next.  
他没有试图说服我，而是先看了看真嗣，然后又转向我。接着，他说的下一句话让我感到意外。

"I guess it won't hurt for you to be here. I'll get you a pillow and some blankets."  
"我想你在这里应该没什么问题。我去给你拿个枕头和一些毯子。"

**Day Seven 第七天**

Here I am again standing over his bed and looking down at his body. The exact same thing I've done for the past seven days. Fuyutsuki is letting me sleep in the room now so I can be close to Shinji. I asked him when Shinji will wake up. He just looked down at the ground and mumbled that he didn't know. That they have got the bullet out, patched him up and are monitoring him. There was something in his voice when he spoke to me though, something he isn't telling me. There is something none of them are telling me.  
我又一次站在他的床边，低头看着他的身体。过去七天里我一直在做同样的事情。如今，冬月让我睡在这个房间里，这样我就能离真嗣近一些。我问过他真嗣什么时候会醒。他只是低头看着地面，含糊地说他不知道。他们已经取出了子弹，给他缝合了伤口，并正在监测他的情况。但当他对我说话时，他的声音里有些东西，有些他没告诉我的事情。他们所有人都有事情瞒着我。

I've seen them out the corner of my eye whispering to each other. Fuyutsuki and Kaji's sister, Misato and Fuyutsuki, the nurses and Misato, Kaji's sister and Misato. They keep on having meetings and talking about things. I suppose it's to do with the people who attacked us, the ones who hurt Shinji. They don't tell me anything though, instead they just look at me with concerned stares as I continue to look over Shinji's comatose body.  
我曾瞥见他们在角落里窃窃私语。冬月和加持的妹妹，美里和冬月，护士们和美里，加持的妹妹和美里。他们不断开会讨论事情。我想这和袭击我们的人有关，那些伤害了真嗣的人。但他们什么也不告诉我，只是在我继续照看真嗣的昏迷身体时，用关切的眼神看着我。

I feel a sharp pain in my stomach, the cramps haven't let up for me this time around. Usually I'll suffer the worst with them on the first day and by the second I'll feel somewhat better. They're staying around longer this time though. A punishment for me causing Shinji to be this way I guess, my bodies way of making me suffer.  
我感到腹部一阵剧痛，这次痉挛一直没有缓解。通常第一天我会最难受，到了第二天就会感觉好些。但这次它们持续得更久了。我想这是对我让真嗣变成这样的惩罚，我的身体在让我受苦。

"Asuka? Can I come in?"  
“明日香？我可以进来吗？”

I hear Misato's voice behind me, she doesn't wait for me to answer her question. She knows I won't answer her, I only speak when I need to.  
我听到美里在我身后说话，她没有等我回答她的问题。她知道我不会回答，我只在需要时才开口。

"Asuka we need to talk. You can't stay like this, I want Shinji to wake up as much as anyone but this isn't healthy. Come on, let's go and do something. We can watch a movie or get food. Anything you want."  
“明日香，我们需要谈谈。你不能这样下去，我也和大家一样希望真嗣能醒来，但这不健康。来吧，我们去做点什么。我们可以看电影或者吃点东西。任何你想要的。”

My stomach churns at the thought of eating, I've barely eaten since it happened. Maybe a piece of toast here and there to shut my stomach up. I won't watch a movie, me and Shinji used to watch movies together. Anything I want? I want Shinji to wake up. Can you provide that Misato?  
想到吃东西，我的胃就翻腾不已，自从那件事发生后我几乎没怎么吃。也许偶尔一片吐司来堵住我的胃。我不会看电影，我和真嗣以前常一起看电影。任何我想要的？我想要真嗣醒来。你能提供这个吗，美里？

Her voice takes a move pleading tone as she places a hand on my shoulder, "Asuka, I... we're all worried about you. Please, you can't be like this.  
她的声音带上了恳求的语气，手放在我的肩上，“明日香，我……我们都很担心你。求你了，你不能这样下去。”

"Don't touch me..." “别碰我……”

My voice is barely above a whisper. I recognize the tone, it's the same one I used before Instrumentality to goad Shinji into acting against me. Misato lifts her hand from my shoulder and steps around to face me blocking my view of Shinji.  
我的声音几乎低不可闻。我认得这种语气，正是我在人类补完计划前用来激使真嗣对我采取行动的那种。美里从我的肩上抬起手，绕到我面前，挡住了我看向真嗣的视线。

"I know you want him back Asuka... I understand that..."  
"我知道你想要他回来，明日香...我理解那一点..."

"No you don't..." "不，你不理解..."

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"You don't understand... you could never understand..."  
"你不明白...你永远不可能明白..."

She kneels down to bring her eyes level with mine, "Asuka, I've been in love... I know what it's like when your loved one gets hurt and... Shinji is like a son to me. I do understand."  
她跪下来，让视线与我平齐，“明日香，我曾深爱过……我知道当所爱之人受伤时的感受……真嗣对我来说就像儿子一样。我确实理解。”

I raise my voice, "No! You don't understand! I... This isn't like with you and Kaji, this wasn't two people flocking to each other for a cheap fuck because they were scared of being alone. You could never understand what me and Shinji had."  
我提高了声音，“不！你不明白！我……这不像你和加持之间，不是因为害怕孤单而随便找个人上床。你永远不可能理解我和真嗣之间的感情。”

To my surprise she doesn't retaliate or get angry despite my harsh words. I see a hint of pain in her eyes as I mention Kaji's name but that is about it. Instead she keeps her tone soft.  
令我惊讶的是，她并没有反击或生气，尽管我的话很尖锐。提到加持的名字时，我看到她眼中闪过一丝痛苦，但仅此而已。相反，她保持着柔和的语气。

"So help me understand, let me help you Asuka."  
"帮我理解一下，让我帮你，明日香。"

For a moment I contemplate telling her about my failure to protect Shinji and how this is all my fault. I contemplate telling her how we grew closer and how I found my purpose in life again through loving him. I don't do that though.  
有那么一刻，我考虑告诉她我未能保护真嗣的失败，以及这一切都是我的错。我考虑告诉她我们是如何变得更亲近，以及我是如何在爱他的过程中重新找到了生活的意义。但我没有这么做。

"No."

"Please, I care about you."  
"拜托，我关心你。"

"No you don't." "不，你不会。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

That was it, the spark I was looking for in her eyes. Soon I'll push her away and I'll be left alone again. She can't understand me like Shinji can. No one can, and I don't deserve any of them to. I don't deserve it from Shinji either. Yet I keep going.  
就是这种眼神，我一直在她眼中寻找的火花。很快我就会把她推开，再次独自一人。她无法像真嗣那样理解我。没有人能理解我，我也不配得到他们的理解。我甚至不配得到真嗣的理解。然而我还是继续前行。

"You don't care about me, you care about Shinji."  
"你不在乎我，你在乎的是真嗣。"

"That's not true Asuka! I brought you into my home, I did care about you..."  
"那不是真的，明日香！我把你带回家，我确实关心你..."

"No you didn't! I was just a tool for you to use, just like I was to the rest of them. Where were you when I needed any help, when I struggled learning the Kanji where were you? When that Angel injured me you weren't there when I woke up in the hospital? Where were you when I was violated by that other Angel? You never cared about me."  
"不，你没有！我只是你利用的工具，就像我对其他人一样。当我需要帮助时你在哪里，当我学习汉字遇到困难时你在哪里？当那个使徒伤害我时，我在医院醒来你不在那里？当另一个使徒侵犯我时，你又在哪里？你从未关心过我。"

"Asuka I..." "明日香，我..."

I can see the sorrow in her eyes, I can see the sadness and the tears starting to form.  
我能从她的眼中看到悲伤，看到那渐渐涌出的泪水和深藏的哀愁。

"You never cared whether I lived or died, as soon as I wasn't capable anymore you discarded me. You probably would have been happier if I had never came back. That way your precious Shinji wouldn't be lying on that bed right now."  
“你从未在乎过我是生是死，一旦我无用便将我抛弃。或许，如果我从未回来，你会更快乐。那样的话，你珍爱的真嗣也不会躺在那张床上。”

I feel a sharp sting across my cheek as my face snaps to the side. I bring my hand up to feel the warm mark from where she slapped me. She yells out at me.  
脸颊传来一阵剧痛，我的头猛地偏向一边。我抬起手，触摸着她扇我耳光留下的温热痕迹。她对着我大喊。

"Stop this now!" "现在就停下！"

I want to retaliate to yell something else. I want to hit her back just so she can hit me again. I want her to give me exactly what I deserve and kick my ass until I'm unconscious but on opening my mouth I'm hit by another pain in my stomach. My hand travels down as I double over and scream out. A wave of nausea washes over me as I still try to say something in retaliation. I'm not going to let it end there, I'm going to keep pushing, I have to keep pushing.  
我想回吼些什么来报复。我想还手，只为让她再次打我。我希望她给我应得的惩罚，把我踢到昏迷为止，但当我张嘴时，胃部又是一阵剧痛。我双手抱腹，弯腰尖叫。一阵恶心感袭来，我仍试图说些什么来反击。我不会就此罢休，我要继续推进，我必须继续推进。

Even as my vision blurs, and black dots appear in front of my eyes I try. I can't though, I stumble to my feet and try to rush towards the door but make it only a few feet before dropping to my knees and throwing up what little contents there are in my stomach. Pain soars through me as I retch, bringing tears to my eyes.  
即使我的视线模糊，眼前出现黑点，我仍在尝试。但我做不到，我踉跄起身，试图冲向门口，却只走了几步就跪倒在地，吐出了胃里仅存的一点东西。剧痛贯穿全身，我呕吐不止，泪水涌出眼眶。

I feel her kneel down next to me and hold my hair for me as the humiliating ordeal comes to an end. She pulls me away from the mess and I try to get to my feet but instead end up collapsing in her arms. I want to fight, I want to break out but I can barely move. Instead something else takes over. I rest my head on her shoulder and cry as she gently strokes my back.  
我感觉她跪在我身边，帮我托住头发，随着这屈辱的折磨接近尾声。她把我从狼藉中拉走，我试图站起来，却反而瘫倒在她的怀里。我想反抗，我想挣脱，但我几乎动弹不得。取而代之的是另一种情绪占据了上风。我把头靠在她的肩上，哭泣着，她温柔地抚摸着我的背。

"Asuka... I do care about you. I... I know I haven't exactly shown that but, I promise I will..."  
“明日香...我确实在乎你。我...我知道我没有明确表现出来，但我保证我会...”

My stomach hurts, my chest hurts and my eyes sting as I finally let myself cry in the arms of my guardian. Through the sobs I say the only thing I can think of at this time. The desperate cries of the lonely person I am.  
我的胃痛，胸口痛，眼睛也刺痛，终于在监护人的怀抱中放声大哭。透过抽泣，我说出了此刻唯一能想到的话。那是孤独者绝望的呼喊。

"It's all my fault… I... want... I want my Mama..."  
“都是我的错……我……想要……我想要妈妈……”

Misato rubs my back and shushes me, "I know... I know you do."  
美里轻抚我的背，轻声安慰我：“我知道……我知道你想要。”

---

I close the door to Shinji's room behind me and go to check on Asuka who is sleeping peacefully on one of the beds nearby. It's hard to believe just looking at her lying there just what she has had to live through. She looks completely innocent, like any other girl. Yet I know what has happened to her throughout her life. Hard to think that the young girl there was yelling at me moments ago, trying to goad me into a conflict before ending up sobbing herself to sleep in my arms.  
我关上真嗣房间的门，走去查看睡在附近床上的明日香。看着她安详地躺在那里，很难相信她经历了什么。她看起来完全无辜，就像其他任何女孩一样。然而，我知道她一生中所经历的一切。很难想象，那个不久前还对我大喊大叫、试图挑起冲突的年轻女孩，最终会在我怀里哭着睡着。

In the room I've just left is Shinji Ikari, another victim in this whole thing. Shot in the chest just over a week ago by a group we still know little to anything about. All we know is they appear to be followers of SEELE and are committed to destroying that which stopped their plans.  
在我刚刚离开的房间里，躺着碇真嗣，这场风波中的另一位受害者。就在一周多前，他被一伙我们几乎一无所知的团体击中胸口。我们所知甚少，只知道他们似乎是 SEELE 的追随者，并决心摧毁那些阻止他们计划的力量。

When I woke up on that beach a week ago I didn't really know what to expect. I was picked up by a young woman who introduced herself to me as Rebecca Kaji. Ryoji's sister, I knew he had one but he never spoke about her. Kaji tried but couldn't keep her with him, and they lost contact. I didn't know they had found each other again. That's just Kaji's way though, to not tell me important things like that.  
一周前，我在那片海滩上醒来时，并不知道会发生什么。一位年轻女子救了我，她自我介绍说是筱宫丽贝卡。筱宫的妹妹，我知道他有妹妹，但他从未提起过她。筱宫曾试图留住她，但未能成功，他们失去了联系。我不知道他们已经重新找到了彼此。这就是筱宫的作风，不告诉我那些重要的事情。

I was excited when I was picked up though. I was excited to see Shinji again and to see Asuka again. I knew it wouldn't be easy, I knew it'd be emotional but I didn't think so shortly after I returned it'd all come crashing down again so easily.  
尽管如此，被救起时我还是感到兴奋。我期待着再次见到真嗣，再次见到明日香。我知道这不会容易，我知道会有很多情感纠葛，但我没想到在我回来后不久，这一切又会如此轻易地崩溃。

Rebecca and her team got the small group responsible for it. There were three of them. Two of them were shot and the third captured. He told us about the followers of SEELE. That there will be more and for us to watch our back. Shortly afterwards he died, killing himself via some implant in his body. It's scary enough that in this new world there are people out there who want to kill these children, even more so that they're willing to sacrifice themselves to do it. With the Angels it seemed simple but with humans… it comes much more complicated.  
丽贝卡和她的团队抓住了负责此事的小组，共有三人。其中两人被击毙，第三人被俘。他向我们透露了 SEELE 追随者的信息，称还会有更多，并提醒我们要小心。不久后，他通过体内的某种植入物自杀身亡。在这个新世界中，有人想要杀害这些孩子，甚至不惜牺牲自己，这令人不寒而栗。与使徒相比，人类的问题似乎更为复杂。

I look back at Asuka's sleeping form just in time for Fuyutsuki to enter the room. I greet the former NERV Sub-Commander somewhat coldly. I haven't forgotten what he was a part of and that all that happened in NERV happened under his nose. Yet I need to put my hopes in him to help Shinji and Asuka right now. He's the most qualified person in this shelter to do that. So I'll put any bitterness aside for their sake.  
我回头看了一眼正在熟睡的明日香，正好看到副司令 Fuyutsuki 进入房间。我有些冷淡地向这位前 NERV 副司令打招呼。我没有忘记他曾是其中一员，NERV 发生的一切他都看在眼里。然而，为了帮助真嗣和明日香，我必须将希望寄托在他身上。他是这个避难所中最有资格的人。因此，为了他们，我将暂时放下心中的苦涩。

"She's still asleep." “她还在睡。”

"Yeah, I cleaned up the mess she made in the room. Sorry about that."  
"是啊，我清理了她在房间里弄的乱七八糟的东西。抱歉啊。"

"It's a medical wing, a little bit of mess like that is to be expected."  
"这里是医疗翼，有点小乱是正常的。"

"This is all my fault isn't it?"  
"这都是我的错，对吧？"

I look at the old man and I see him regard me with a curious stare, "Why would you say that?"  
我看着那位老人，他好奇地盯着我，问道：“你为何这么说？”

"She told me as much, when she was yelling at me. I know she was angry but it was true. I didn't do enough for her when she lived with me. I was more concerned with Shinji or finding out the truth behind what was going on at NERV. I knew what she had been through and I never made the effort to help her…"  
“她冲我大吼时就是这么说的。我知道她很生气，但那是事实。她和我住在一起时，我没有为她做足够多的事。我更关心的是真嗣，或是揭开 NERV 背后真相的谜团。我知道她经历了什么，却从未努力去帮助她……”

"Did she ever come to you for help?"  
“她有没有向你寻求过帮助？”

"That's not an excuse, I was her commanding officer and her guardian… I should have seen what was happening to her."  
“那不是借口，我是她的指挥官也是她的监护人……我本该察觉到她身上发生的事情。”

Why am I confessing all of this to Fuyutsuki? Maybe it's because he's the only person in this damn place who might understand. I continue, "You know she blames herself for what happened to Shinji."  
为什么我会向冬月坦白这一切？也许是因为他是这个该死的地方唯一可能理解我的人。我继续说：“你知道她为真嗣发生的事情自责。”

He nods his head solemnly, "Yes I had a feeling that she might. Just like you're blaming yourself for the state she is in now. Just as when I look at the state the world is in now and blame myself."  
他严肃地点点头，“是的，我也有这种感觉。就像你现在为她现在的状况自责一样。正如我看着现在世界的状况而自责一样。”

"There's a lot of blame to go around isn't there?"  
"责任到处都是，不是吗？"

"Some of it is deserved, some of it isn't. In Asuka's case I believe she blames herself for everything that happened to Shinji. She believes that the way she acted to him before Third Impact led to him doing what he did during Third Impact and she has taken it upon herself to protect him."  
"有些是应得的，有些则不然。在明日香的情况中，我相信她把发生在真嗣身上的一切都归咎于自己。她认为自己在第三次冲击前对待他的方式导致了他在第三次冲击中所做的事情，因此她决定自己要保护他。"

"Protect Shinji huh? So she thinks she failed… poor girl."  
"保护真嗣吗？这么说她觉得自己失败了……可怜的女孩。"

I reach a hand out and gently press it against her pale cheek. She can't keep blaming herself, this has to stop but I don't know what to do. I turn around to Fuyutsuki and I wonder, does he blame himself for what has happened just as I'm blaming myself and just like Asuka is.  
我伸出手，轻轻地抚摸她苍白的脸颊。她不能一直自责，这必须停止，但我不知道该怎么办。我转身看向冬月，我想知道，他是否也像我和明日香一样，为所发生的一切自责。

"Do you blame yourself?" “你自责吗？”

"Of course I do… over the last fifteen years I stood back and let SEELE and Gendo do what they wanted. I could have tried to stop it, I had the evidence against them but fear prevented that."  
“当然，我自责……过去十五年里，我袖手旁观，任由 SEELE 和碇源堂为所欲为。我本可以尝试阻止他们，我有对他们不利的证据，但恐惧阻止了我。”

He pauses for a moment, "What I was part of… I cannot make up for that. I should have stopped Gendo, I should have tried to talk sense into him. I had the evidence to stop SEELE and they would have killed me if I released it but my sacrifice would have been enough to stop this from happening."  
他顿了顿，“我所参与的那一切……我无法弥补。我本该阻止源堂，本该试图劝他理智。我有证据阻止 Seele，但如果我公开，他们会杀了我，但我的牺牲本可以阻止这一切发生。”

"Or maybe it wouldn't, SEELE practically ran the world. They would have gotten what they wanted eventually. Maybe this had to happen."  
“或许也不会，Seele 几乎掌控了世界。他们终将得到他们想要的。也许这一切必须发生。”

"Perhaps it did. Regardless we can only move forward, we were all punished enough during Third Impact. We tried to run away into our dreams only to find them to be falsehoods. Maybe instead of looking for blame and forgiveness we should realize that we were forgiven when we were allows to return."  
“或许确实如此。无论如何，我们只能向前看，在第三次冲击中我们都受到了足够的惩罚。我们试图逃入梦境，却发现它们是虚幻的。也许我们不应该寻找责备和宽恕，而应该意识到，当我们被允许回来时，我们已经被宽恕了。”

I laugh at his words, "You know I always had you figured for the kindly words of wisdom sort of person but I didn't actually expect it."  
我笑着回应他的话，“你知道我一直觉得你是那种会说出智慧箴言的人，但我没想到你真的会这么说。”

"They aren't actually my words."  
“这些话其实不是我说的。”

"Oh, whose are they?" “哦，那是谁说的？”

"Shinji said them to me. I told him that Asuka was right to be angry at me when I returned, that I didn't deserve any forgiveness. He said those words to me."  
"真嗣把这些话告诉了我。我告诉他，明日香对我发火是应该的，我回来时确实不配得到任何原谅。他对我说的这些话。"

I look towards the room where he is sleeping and then back down to Asuka letting those words wash over me. A part of me can't quite believe Shinji said them but then I guess it makes some sort of sense.  
我望向他睡觉的房间，然后又低头看向明日香，任由这些话在我心中回荡。我的一部分难以置信真嗣会这么说，但转念一想，这也有一定的道理。

"Forgiving us all so easily… he's a stronger person than most."  
"如此轻易地原谅我们所有人……他比大多数人都要坚强。"

"Yes he is." "是的，他是。"

---

My eyes open and I start to wake from my thankfully dreamless sleep. As I look up I recognise the ceiling as belonging to the medical wing and slowly the memories start to seep back through of what happened. I remember the argument with Misato, I remember throwing up and sobbing in her arms. I feel my stomach growl as I prop myself up on my elbows and look around.  
我睁开眼睛，从一场庆幸无梦的睡眠中醒来。抬头望去，我认出那是我所在的医疗翼的天花板，记忆慢慢渗回，我想起了发生的事情。我记得与美里争吵，记得在她的怀里呕吐和哭泣。当我用肘部撑起自己，环顾四周时，我的肚子咕咕叫了起来。

"So you're finally awake?"  
"你终于醒了？"

I turn and see Misato sat by my side, she's reading a magazine and has a cup of coffee in one hand. I look away too embarrassed to say anything to her. I hate that feeling, knowing that I'll have to swallow my pride and apologize for what I said. It's new to me, normally I'd just shut myself off or ignore the issue but I can't. Not anymore.  
我转身看到美里坐在我旁边，她正在读一本杂志，一手端着咖啡。我尴尬地移开视线，不敢跟她说话。我讨厌这种感觉，明知必须放下自尊，为我说过的话道歉。这对我来说是新的体验，通常我会选择封闭自己或忽视问题，但现在不行了。

"H-How long was I asleep for?"  
“我……我睡了多久？”

"About four hours, I've been here this whole time."  
“大约四个小时，我一直在这里。”

Great, all those things I said to her and she does something like that. Here goes, "I'm sorry about what I said… I…"  
真是的，我对她说的那些话，她却做出这种事。好吧，“我对我说的话感到抱歉……我……”

"It's fine Asuka, I know why you said what you did and… there was truth in some of it. The truth is I wasn't as good a guardian to you as I should have been. In fact I could have done a lot more for both you and Shinji. I failed you both. I understand your anger towards me."  
“没事的，明日香，我知道你为什么那么说，而且……有些话确实有道理。事实是我没有尽到一个好监护人的责任。实际上，我本可以为你们俩做得更多。我让你们失望了。我理解你对我的愤怒。”

I sit myself up properly and my stomach growls again. I look away embarrassed at that being the response to Misato's heartfelt apology. She reaches down and hands me a box of dry crackers, I take them from her and smile at the irony. How long has it been since I did this exactly thing for Shinji to help when he was feeling ill. Now I'm having it happen to me. I take one out of the box and nibble at it as Misato shoots me a concerned stare.  
我坐直身子，肚子又咕噜响了一声。我尴尬地移开视线，因为这成了对美里真心道歉的回应。她弯腰递给我一盒干饼干，我接过来，苦笑了一下。我为真嗣做过多少次这样的事来帮助他缓解不适。现在轮到我了。我从盒子里拿了一块，小口咬着，美里则担忧地盯着我。

"You haven't been eating have you?"  
"你一直没吃东西，对吧？"

I finish the cracker and shake my head slowly, "No… I haven't, how did you know?"  
我吃完饼干，缓缓摇头，“不……我没有吃，你怎么知道的？”

"Fuyutsuki took a look at you while you were sleeping. You've lost weight in the past week, you're looking pale and gaunt. That mixed with the stress of what happened to Shinji and the lack of sleep and you being on your period has taken a toll on your body. Asuka you're hurting yourself…"  
"你在睡觉时，冬月老师看了你一眼。过去一周你瘦了不少，脸色苍白憔悴。再加上真嗣的事情带来的压力、睡眠不足，还有你正在经期，这些对你的身体造成了很大影响。明日香，你在伤害自己……"

She isn't telling me anything I didn't already know. All I can do is hang my head and weakly reply, "I know…"  
她并没有告诉我什么我不知道的事。我只能垂下头，无力地回答：“我知道……”

"Why?" "为什么？"

I shrug not able to put together an answer. I haven't been able to sleep because I keep having nightmares about Shinji, I haven't ate because I can't. I'm either scared I'll throw it back up, it feels wrong without Shinji being there or I just haven't felt like it. I don't want to hurt myself but I guess I feel I deserve to be hurt because of my failure.  
我耸耸肩，无法组织出一个答案。我无法入睡，因为总是梦到真嗣的噩梦；我无法进食，因为我做不到。要么是害怕会吐出来，要么是觉得没有真嗣在身边就不对劲，要么就是根本没胃口。我不想伤害自己，但我想我应该因为自己的失败而受到惩罚。

"Asuka… you can't blame yourself for what happened to Shinji. You can't punish yourself for it anymore… he wouldn't want that."  
“明日香……你不能因为真嗣发生的事而自责。你不能再这样惩罚自己了……他不会希望你这样的。”

"I promised I'd protect him… and I failed…"  
"我答应过要保护他……可我却失败了……"

"You didn't fail Asuka, he's alive isn't he?"  
"你没有失败，明日香，他还活着，不是吗？"

"I did fail. I ran away from you both, if I didn't do that he wouldn't have been shot. He wouldn't be… it's all my fault."  
"我确实失败了。我逃离了你们俩，如果我没有那么做，他就不会中枪。他不会……这都是我的错。"

She sighs, "They were watching you for some time Asuka waiting for the right moment. If they hadn't have done that then they would have picked another time, there was no way to know, nothing you could do. If it was any other time they might have succeeded in killing him."  
她叹了口气，“他们已经观察你一段时间了，明日香，等待合适的时机。如果不是那时，他们也会选择另一个时间，你无法预知，也无能为力。如果是其他时候，他们可能已经成功杀了他。”

I know what she is saying makes sense, there has been a voice in my head for the past week saying those exact words to me repeatedly. I know deep down I'm not to blame but for every time that voice sounds all I can hear is an even louder one telling me what a failure I am. Telling me that it's my fault for running like I did. It tells me that I failed to protect Shinji just like I failed in the fight against the Angels. It tells me that I've once again lost my purpose in life. I look over towards Shinji's room and I take another cracker from the box.  
"我知道她说的有道理，过去一周里，我的脑海中一直有个声音反复对我说着同样的话。我深知自己并非责任所在，但每当那个声音响起，我只能听到一个更响亮的声音告诉我自己有多失败。它指责我逃跑的行为是我的错。它告诉我，我未能保护真嗣，就像我在与使徒的战斗中失败一样。它告诉我，我再次失去了生活的目标。我望向真嗣的房间，又从盒子里拿了一块饼干。”

"He wouldn't want you to be like this Asuka, it'd hurt him to know you were hurting yourself like that."  
“真嗣不会希望你这样子的，明日香，知道你在这样伤害自己，他会心痛的。”

I cringe at the thought of him being hurt further by my actions. I don't want to hurt him anymore but what am I supposed to do? Can I just get on with my life hoping that he'll wake up? I can't do that because I want to be there when he wakes up, I want to be the first person he sees when he wakes up. I want him to tell me he is alright and I want to look into his eyes and tell him I love him.  
想到我的行为可能会让他再次受伤，我不禁感到一阵畏缩。我不想再伤害他了，但我该怎么办呢？我能就这样继续我的生活，希望他会醒来吗？我做不到，因为我想要在他醒来时在场，我想成为他醒来后看到的第一个人。我希望他能告诉我他没事，我想凝视他的眼睛，告诉他我爱他。

"I want… to be there when he wakes up…"  
“我想要……在他醒来时在场……”

She shoots me a sympathetic glance before taking my hand in her own and rubbing it gently. As I look into her eyes I see the familiar dark circles around her eyes. I guess it's just like it was before, we're all suffering in our own way. Misato can't be taking this well despite the front she puts on. I've been so concerned with myself I forgot about others it might affect.  
她同情地看了我一眼，然后握住我的手，轻轻地揉搓着。当我凝视她的眼睛时，我看到了她眼周熟悉的黑眼圈。我想情况还是和以前一样，我们都在以自己的方式受苦。尽管美里表面上装作没事，但她肯定也不好受。我一直只顾着自己的感受，忘记了这可能会影响到其他人。

"I know you do, I do as well."  
"我知道你明白，我也一样。"

"You know it's been a while since we spoke…"  
"你知道，我们好久没聊过了……"

I nod, "I know, the last time will have been before the twelfth Angel."  
我点头，“我知道，上次聊天应该是在第十二使徒之前。”

"You never did forgive me for not yelling at Shinji did you?"  
"你从未原谅我没有对真嗣大喊大叫，对吧？"

I let out a sigh and the memories of what happened around that time come back. It was around the time Kaji and Misato started seeing each other again. It was around the time I tried to kiss Shinji. It was around the time that my performance in the Eva declined. I remember telling her to yell at Shinji, I was angry but it wasn't with him or her. It was with myself for starting to lose first place and being powerless against the Angel.  
我叹了口气，那段时间的记忆又涌上心头。那时，加持和美里又开始交往了。那时，我试图亲吻真嗣。那时，我在 Eva 的表现开始下滑。我记得告诉她要对真嗣大喊大叫，我很生气，但不是对他或她。是对我自己，因为我开始失去第一的位置，对使徒无能为力。

I'm too weak to even try to hide my real feelings, "I was mad at a lot of things I had no reason to be mad at. I was blaming everyone for my own issues."  
我太软弱，甚至无法掩饰我的真实感受，“我对很多无理由的事情感到愤怒。我把自己的问题归咎于每个人。”

"Do you think I was too soft on him at times?"  
"你觉得我有时对他是不是太心软了？"

I look towards his room and I smile, "Sometimes… I guess. I didn't really know what I knew then though and I was a little bit jealous too."  
我望向他的房间，微笑道：“有时候……可能是吧。那时我并不真正了解我所知道的一切，而且我也有点嫉妒。”

I'm a little bit surprised at my own honesty in front of Misato but like I said I'm too tired and feeling too weak to hide anything anymore. I'm fed up of hiding my feelings.  
在美里面前，我对自己的坦诚感到有些惊讶，但正如我所说，我太累了，感觉太虚弱，再也隐藏不了任何东西了。我已经厌倦了隐藏我的感情。

"I'm sorry I neglected you Asuka. It just seemed like you never needed any help and Shinji needed all of it. Even towards the end you were back and fighting and kicking ass and I had to drag Shinji to Unit 01."  
“对不起，我忽略了你，明日香。只是你看起来从不需帮助，而真嗣却需要全部。即便到了最后，你回归战斗，英勇无比，我却得拖着真嗣去驾驶初号机。”

I laugh, "I know… you offered to sleep with him didn't you?"  
我笑着说：“我知道……你提出要和他上床，对吧？”

I made sure to time the second part of that just as she was taking a sip of her coffee. She jerks forward nearly spitting the contents out.  
我特意在她说第二部分时，等她刚喝一口咖啡。她猛地前倾，差点把咖啡喷出来。

"W-W-What? Y-You? H-How?"  
"什-什-什么？你-你？怎-怎么？"

I mimic her voice, "We'll do the rest when you get back, wasn't that what you said?"  
我模仿她的声音，"你回来后我们再处理剩下的，不是你说的吗？"

Her cheeks glow red and her expression is somewhat horrified, "I… I didn't mean… I wouldn't, I was desperate for him to do something and I thought…"  
她的脸颊泛红，表情有些惊恐，"我……我不是那个意思……我不会，我当时只是急切地希望他能做点什么，我以为……"

I laugh some more and sit up properly. Laughing at Misato has made me forget a little bit about the pain I'm in, "I know exactly what you thought you old pervert and if you even try anything with him I'll kill you."  
我又笑了一会儿，然后坐直身子。嘲笑美里让我暂时忘记了身上的疼痛，“我知道你这老色鬼在想什么，如果你敢对他动手动脚，我一定会杀了你。”

She smirks, "Jealous?" 她微微一笑，“嫉妒了？”

"Of you? Not a chance, just giving you a warning to keep your hands off my boyfriend."  
“嫉妒你？不可能，只是警告你别打我男朋友的主意。”

"Oh boyfriend is it? I've missed a lot haven't I?"  
"哦，男朋友是吧？我错过了很多，不是吗？"

We both laugh but it's soon replaced by a sad silence as she realized that she has missed a lot. Shinji and I were here for six weeks on our own before anyone returned. It's been another four weeks since then. Misato has missed ten weeks and I think she is just starting to realize that now.  
我们俩都笑了，但很快就被一种悲伤的沉默所取代，因为她意识到自己错过了很多。真嗣和我独自在这里度过了六周，直到其他人回来。那之后又过了四周。美里错过了十周，我想她现在才开始意识到这一点。

I don't quite know what to say now. I'm not very good at making other people feel better unless it's Shinji. I can do things with Shinji that I'm certainly not going to do with Misato. Thankfully I don't have to say anything as Fuyutsuki enters the room. He noticed I'm awake and walks over towards us, "How are you feeling Asuka?"  
我现在不太知道该说什么。我不太擅长让别人感觉好些，除非是真嗣。我可以和真嗣做些事情，当然不会和美里做。幸好我不必说什么，因为冬月进来了。他注意到我醒了，朝我们走来，“你感觉怎么样，明日香？”

I smile, "Being honest, I feel like shit."  
我微笑道：“说实话，我感觉糟透了。”

"Well the past week has taken a toll on your body although I'm sure Katsuragi has already been through that with you so I'll spare you the lecture. I'm certain you don't need me of all people to tell you what you likely already know."  
“过去这一周对你的身体影响不小，不过我相信 Katsuragi 已经和你谈过了，所以我就不再赘述。我确信你不需要我这样的人来告诉你那些你大概已经知道的事。”

He pauses for a moment, "With that said I'm sure you're aware we have to do something. I can't allow you to continue in this fashion."  
他顿了顿，“话虽如此，我相信你也明白我们必须采取行动。我不能让你继续这样下去。”

"Yeah… I know." “嗯……我知道。”

"I'm going to keep you in here overnight to watch over you and after that you're free to go. From today onwards I'm going to have to ask you to now spend all day watching over Shinji."  
“我今晚要把你留在这里看护你，之后你就可以自由离开了。从今天起，我必须要求你现在全天候看护真嗣。”

His voice is stern, similar to how he would speak to us when we were pilots. I'm tempted for a moment to ask him what right he has to talk to me like that. That it's partially his fault the world is in this state but to my credit I don't. He's the doctor here and as much as it hurts my pride he is right to speak to me in this way. That doesn't stop me from saying something though, "No I wan-"  
他的语气严厉，就像我们作为驾驶员时他对我们说话的方式一样。有那么一刻，我忍不住想问他有什么权利这样跟我说话。世界变成这样，部分也是他的错，但我忍住了没说。他是这里的医生，尽管这伤害了我的自尊，但他这样跟我说话是正确的。不过，这并不妨碍我说些什么，“不，我不想——”

He raises his hand, "You didn't let me finish. During the day I can't have you in there watching over him. I appreciate that you want to be in there and you want to help him but just standing there doing nothing all day is not going to accomplish anything. I'll have a bed set up in there so you can stay there overnight if you would like to."  
他举起手，“你没让我说完。白天我不能让你在里面守着他。我理解你想在里面陪他、想帮助他的心情，但整天站在那里无所事事是不会有任何进展的。我会在里面放一张床，如果你想的话，你可以晚上留在那里。”

I nod, it's a compromise I suppose. "Fine…"  
我点点头，这算是一种妥协吧。“好吧……”

"There are also other things that you might be able to do. Shinji in in a comatose state at this moment in time. In all honestly we don't know when he'll wake up."  
“还有其他事情你可能可以做。真嗣目前处于昏迷状态。说实话，我们不知道他什么时候会醒过来。”

My gut wrenches at hearing him say those words. Not just because I care about him but because I can remember my experiences of being in that state. I was in a medically induced coma for a couple of days but it was hell. I remember an endless sea of surreal dreamscapes. Flipping from one hellish world to another. Confronting my demons of the past and present with no hope of escape. I wonder if that is what Shinji is dealing with right now.  
听到他说出那些话，我内心感到一阵绞痛。不仅仅是因为我在乎他，还因为我能回忆起自己处于那种状态的经历。我曾因医疗原因陷入昏迷几天，那简直是地狱。我记得一片无尽的超现实梦境海洋。从一个地狱般的世界翻转到另一个。面对过去和现在的恶魔，毫无逃脱的希望。我不知道真嗣现在是否也在经历这些。

"We are capable of taking care of Shinji from a medical standpoint. I do however think it would be beneficial to Shinji and yourself if you were able to take on certain responsibilities in his care that we cannot provide."  
“从医疗角度来看，我们有能力照顾真嗣。不过，我认为如果你能承担一些我们无法提供的护理责任，这对真嗣和你自己都会有益。”

I look at him, "I'll do anything to help him."  
我看着他，“我会尽一切努力帮助他。”

"I know. What I would like to do then, starting from tomorrow and this depends on my assessment of you as well Asuka."  
"我知道。那么，我希望从明天开始，这取决于我对你的评估，还有明日香。"

He's obviously referring to how I've been this past week in regards to my own health. He waits for me to say something, "I-I understand."  
他显然是指我过去一周对自己健康的态度。他等着我说话，“我……我明白。”

"Good. In which case I'd like to schedule times for both yourself and Katsuragi to provide certain care and support for Shinji."  
"很好。那样的话，我想安排你和葛城同学为真嗣提供特定护理和支持的时间。"

"What would we have to do?"  
"我们得做些什么呢？"

"Well for a start I'd like to arrange some basic physical therapy for him. It's important his joints and muscles get some basic level of exercise while he is in this state. Katsuragi I believe you might be best suited for that given your combat training."  
"首先，我想为他安排一些基础的物理治疗。在他这种状态下，保持关节和肌肉的基本活动很重要。葛城，考虑到你的战斗训练，我认为你最适合做这件事。"

I look to Misato as she nods, "I can assist with that."  
我看向美里，她点头道："我可以协助这个。"

I look back at Fuyutsuki, "What about me?"  
我回头看向冬月，“那我呢？”

"You can assist Katsuragi in these basic exercises if you wish. I would however like to schedule some time in the afternoon for you to visit him and provide mental stimulation for Shinji."  
“如果你愿意，可以协助葛城进行这些基础训练。不过，我希望下午能安排一段时间让你去探望他，为真嗣提供一些精神上的刺激。”

"Mental stimulation?" “精神刺激？”

He nods, "Yes, the experience of being in a coma will be different from person to person. Research has shown that those within a coma can sometimes be aware of surroundings. This can at times aid them in waking up and acclimatising when they have woken up. Therefore I'd like to arrange for you to spend an hour with him providing him with certain stimuli that may assist him."  
他点头道：“是的，昏迷的经历因人而异。研究表明，昏迷中的人有时能感知周围环境。这有时能帮助他们醒来并适应。因此，我想安排你花一小时陪他，提供一些可能有助于他的刺激。”

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"I'll compile a list but it would be things like announcing you're in the room when you begin to let him know you're there. Tell him about your day, read something to him or let him listen to his favourite music."  
“我会列个清单，但主要是像你开始时宣布你在房间里，让他知道你在那里。告诉他你的一天，读点什么给他听，或者让他听他最喜欢的音乐。”

So go in there and talk to him. Tell him about my day and how I am. I can do that, I can let him listen to the music we used to listen to together. I can tell him about the lyrics and the stories behind them. Yeah, that's easy!  
“所以进去和他聊聊。告诉他我的一天和我怎么样。我可以做到，我可以让他听我们一起听过的音乐。我可以告诉他歌词和背后的故事。是的，这很简单！”

"I'll do it, I promised when I returned I'd help him in any way I could. So I'll do it."  
“我会做的，我承诺过回来后会尽我所能帮助他。所以我会做的。”

Fuyutsuki smiles, "I thought you would. I will warn you though, this is on the provision that you start taking care of yourself. I do not want another episode like the one earlier in my medical wing. You will have a time limit on being able to see him during the day. I'll arrange for a bed to be put in there for you as well but I expect you to abide by those provisions."  
“福音次微微一笑，“我就知道你会同意。不过我要提醒你，前提是你得开始照顾好自己。我不希望医疗翼再发生之前那样的情况。你白天探望他的时间会有所限制。我会安排在那儿放一张床给你，但我希望你能遵守这些规定。”

I'm proud of myself for not snapping at him despite a voice eating away at me wanting me to do so. I still don't trust him, I still don't like him but if this allows me to help Shinji then I'll do it. I'll put that aside and I'll abide by his rules.  
“尽管内心有个声音在怂恿我反驳他，但我为自己没有爆发感到自豪。我仍然不信任他，仍然不喜欢他，但如果这能让我帮助真嗣，我会这么做。我会把那些情绪放在一边，遵守他的规则。”

"I understand" "我明白"

"Good. For now I'm ordering you to get some rest and to eat something. Katsuragi I'll leave that in your hands. If you'll both excuse me I have to check on Shinji."  
"好。现在我命令你去休息一下，吃点东西。葛城，这事交给你了。如果你们不介意的话，我得去看看真嗣。"

He leaves to enter the room with Shinji in. Misato grabs my hand again, "Shinji will be alright Asuka… he's strong then we think."  
他离开去真嗣所在的房间。美里再次抓住我的手，“真嗣会没事的，明日香……他比我们想象的要坚强。”

"I know he is Misato. I think he's the strongest one out of all of us. He loves me despite all I ever did to him. He forgave me when he shouldn't have done. He's a special person."  
我知道他是美里。我觉得他是我们所有人中最强大的。尽管我对他所做的一切，他依然爱我。他本不该原谅我，却宽恕了我。他是个特别的人。

### Chapter 15 Introjection
**Day 8**

A lone figure dressed in a black robe stands at the centre of the stage illuminated by a single spotlight. I'm unable to see their face but I rise to my feet as they open their mouth.  
一个身着黑袍的孤独身影站在聚光灯下的舞台中央。我看不清他们的脸，但当他们开口时，我站了起来。

_And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue  
嘿，宝贝，你那守护者的蓝眼睛_

The figure takes one step forward, there is the sound of pyrotechnics, a flash and smoke and they discard the robe. They are now stood in a pure white suit, chills run down my spine and I feel a hand reaching for mine as the singer continues onto the next line.  
那身影向前迈出一步，随即响起烟火声，一道闪光和烟雾过后，他们脱下了长袍。此刻，他们身着纯白西装站立，我不禁打了个寒颤，感觉有只手伸向我的手，而歌手继续唱到下一句。

_Hey my baby! Don't you know our love is true.  
嘿，我的宝贝！你难道不知道我们的爱是真挚的吗？_

Drums begin to accompany him. He sings the next lines as I continue to watch my eyes firmly fixed ahead. There is no sound from the crowd around me, we're all glued on the image, transfixed as the singer and band bring the song to a climax.  
鼓声开始伴奏。他唱着下一句，而我继续目不转睛地盯着前方。周围的人群鸦雀无声，我们都紧盯着那个画面，被歌手和乐队带入歌曲的高潮，完全沉浸其中。

_Can't you feel our souls ignite  
难道你感受不到我们灵魂的点燃_  
_Shedding ever changing colours, in the darkness of the fading night.  
在渐逝夜色的黑暗中，不断变换色彩。_  
_Like the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows  
如同河流汇入海洋，种子中的胚芽生长_  
_We have finally been freed to get back home.  
我们终于得以解脱，重返家园。_

The hand around mine tightens before moving slightly and our fingers intertwine. I don't turn to look at her but I can sense the smile on her face. I know what this means to her, to see this being performed in this way. It isn't just a performance of the song with the band playing it and the singer singing it. Although it isn't the original band the act have made sure the entire performance is as the original would have had it. The lighting, the screens in the back and the costumes. It's all as Asuka used to tell it was back in that apartment.  
她握住我的手紧了紧，然后轻轻移动，我们的手指交缠在一起。我没有转头去看她，但能感觉到她脸上的微笑。我知道这对她意味着什么，以这种方式呈现这首歌。这不仅仅是一个乐队演奏、歌手演唱的表演。尽管这不是原乐队，但表演者确保整个演出与原版如出一辙。灯光、背景屏幕和服装，一切都如 Asuka 曾在那间公寓里描述的那样。

_There's an angel standing in the sun, and he's crying with a loud voice  
有个天使站在阳光下，他正大声哭泣_  
_"This is the supper of the might one"  
这是强者的晚餐_  
_Lord of Lords 万王之王_  
_King of Kings 众君之君_  
_Has returned to lead his children home  
已归来引领他的孩子们回家_  
_To take them to the new Jerusalem  
带他们前往新的耶路撒冷_

As he sings the last word he grabs a shining white swordlike prop from the stage. He slowly begins to raise it upwards whilst also looking up towards the ceiling of the concert hall. The music fades out and the lights around him go completely dim and his own spotlight getting brighter. As the music fades out and we're left with this angelic looking figure on stage we all begin to applaud loudly.  
当他唱到最后一个词时，他从舞台上抓起一把闪亮的白色剑形道具。他缓缓地将其举起，同时目光投向音乐厅的天花板。音乐渐渐淡出，周围的灯光完全暗淡，而他的聚光灯却变得更加明亮。随着音乐的消逝，我们眼前留下这个天使般的舞台形象，所有人都开始热烈鼓掌。

As the final note fades out and the applause dies down the singer steps of this angelic character, brings on the rest of the band who bow and thank us one last time. Me and Asuka leave the packed concert hall and step outside into the cool air. It's quite cold but neither of us bother to put our jackets on instead quite enjoying the contrast from the warm hall. I realize that we're still holding hands and our eyes meet each other.  
随着最后一音符渐渐消散，掌声也逐渐平息，这位天使般的歌手走下舞台，带来了乐队的其他成员，他们最后一次鞠躬向我们致谢。我和明日香离开了拥挤的音乐厅，踏入外面的凉爽空气中。虽然相当寒冷，但我们都没有穿上外套，反而享受着与温暖大厅的鲜明对比。我意识到我们仍然牵着手，目光相遇。

Asuka quickly releases her grip and turns away, I can quickly make out her cheeks turning red as she does so.  
明日香迅速松开手，转过身去，我很快注意到她的脸颊因羞涩而泛红。

"Come on then Third, we'd better get home."  
“走吧，第三，我们最好回家。”

She doesn't give me a chance to respond and instead starts walking. I catch up to her and start walking alongside her. Now the awkward silence settles in as I wonder what I should say.  
她没给我回应的机会，径自开始走。我追上她，与她并肩而行。此刻，尴尬的沉默笼罩下来，我思索着该说些什么。

"So… did you enjoy yourself?"  
“那么……你玩得开心吗？”

I turn my head ever so slightly to look for her reaction, she's smiling.  
我微微侧头，寻找她的反应，她正微笑着。

"Yeah I did… I suppose I should thank you."  
“是啊，我做了……我想我应该谢谢你。”

"It's no problem… after all I owed you for helping with Touji…"  
“没什么……毕竟我欠你人情，你帮过我处理与东二的事……”

The smile quickly fades away and I get the suspicion I've said the wrong thing, "Yeah… I guess you did."  
笑容迅速消失，我怀疑自己说错了话，“是啊……我想你确实欠我。”

We cross a road and looking down I can see the bus the band use for their tour. Around it are a few people pushing boxes around accompanied by security provided by Section 2. Security provided because our presence at the concert. My heart drops slightly at remembering the reality of the situation. For two hours and thirty minutes we were both able to forget about that reality. We were able to act like people our age do and just enjoy a concert. On leaving we're reminded almost instantly.  
我们穿过一条马路，我低头一看，看到了乐队巡演用的巴士。周围有几个人在推着箱子，旁边是第 2 支部提供的安保人员。因为我们在演唱会的出现，所以有了这些安保。一想起现实的状况，我的心不由得沉了一下。在两个半小时的时间里，我们俩都暂时忘却了那个现实。我们能够像同龄人一样，只是享受一场演唱会。但一离开，现实就立刻提醒了我们。

I wonder if the band know the reason for the extra security or if they know about what happens to this city every couple of weeks. Come to think about it I don't really know how news of the Angel attacks are reported outside of Tokyo-3. Do they know about the Angels? Do they know about Eva? It makes the last song they sang a little bit ironic, singing about and acting the part of an Angelic figure at the end of it while most people in this city live in fear of beings we call Angels.  
我不知道乐队是否知道增加安保的原因，或者他们是否了解这座城市每隔几周发生的事情。仔细想想，我并不真正了解东京-3 以外的地区是如何报道使徒袭击的新闻的。他们知道使徒吗？他们知道 Eva 吗？这使得他们最后唱的那首歌带上了一丝讽刺意味，在歌曲结尾扮演天使般的角色，而这座城市的大多数人却生活在对被称为使徒的存在的恐惧之中。

We have to prepare now for the next Angel. If I remember correctly it'll attack in a couple of days. It won't be like that time though. In that world it attacked swiftly and took out Asuka with minimal effort. Rei tried to attack it with an N2 mine but failed and I… well in that world I had ran away from NERV. Only to go back when I saw Unit 2 get decimated by it. This time is different though. I haven't ran away, my father won't try to use the Dummy Plug and I'll be able to pilot Unit 1 from the beginning.  
我们必须现在就开始准备应对下一个使徒。如果我没记错的话，它将在几天后发动攻击。但这次不会像上次那样。在那个世界里，它迅速出击，几乎不费吹灰之力就击败了明日香。绫波试图用 N2 地雷攻击它，但失败了，而我……在那个世界里，我逃离了 NERV，直到看到二号机被它摧毁才返回。但这次不同。我没有逃跑，父亲也不会尝试使用模拟插入栓，我将从一开始就能驾驶初号机。

I'll fight from the start, both myself and Asuka can take it out with no problem. It won't hurt her, it won't cut my cable. I won't get trapped in my own Eva for thirty days. I won't let any of them get hurt.  
我会从一开始就投入战斗，我和明日香都能轻松解决它。它不会伤害她，也不会切断我的电缆。我不会被困在自己的 EVA 里三十天。我不会让任何一个人受伤。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Can… we do something like this again sometime? I really liked doing this… with you."  
“我们……以后还能再做这样的事吗？我真的很喜欢和你一起做这件事。”

I watch for any reaction from her. I think I can see some surprise but it's quickly replaced by a sigh and a typical Asuka reply, "I guess… but don't expect me to pay. That's your job."  
我观察她的反应。我想我看到了一丝惊讶，但很快就被一声叹息和一个典型的明日香式的回答所取代，“我想……但别指望我付钱。那是你的工作。”

Good enough for me. We reach for each other's hand and continue to walk home together.  
对我来说足够好了。我们伸手握住对方的手，继续一起走回家。

**Day 9**

"Okay Shinji, that's enough for today. We have everything we need."  
“好了，真嗣，今天够了。我们需要的东西都有了。”

"Right." "对。"

A sigh escapes my lips as the LCL starts to drain from the Entry Plug. I can feel its movement towards the appropriate platform and I ready myself for the door to be opened so I can finally escape this place for another day. I'm the only one here today. Something to do with a strange reading during the last fight against the Angel. I suspect it was to do with the Dummy Plug but I keep my mouth shut. I'm not supposed to know about the Dummy Plug.  
随着 LCL 开始从插入栓中排出，我轻叹一声。我能感觉到它正向适当的平台移动，我准备好迎接舱门的开启，以便我终于能在这一天逃离这个地方。今天只有我一个人在这里。这与上次与使徒战斗时的一个奇怪读数有关。我怀疑这与模拟插入栓有关，但我保持沉默。我不应该知道模拟插入栓的事情。

As I step outside I look towards the end of the platform and see Misato waiting for me. She greets me with a warm smile. Her arm is in a sling and her head is bandaged but she has been happy throughout the week. It's a stark contrast to the first go around. At this point I had made my decision to quit NERV again, I was locked up in a cell whilst they destroyed my records.  
当我走出舱外，我望向平台的尽头，看到美里在等我。她用温暖的微笑迎接我。她的手臂吊着绷带，头上也包扎着，但这一周她一直很开心。这与第一次的经历形成了鲜明对比。在那时，我已经决定再次离开 NERV，我被关在牢房里，而他们销毁了我的记录。

The atmosphere in NERV is lighter. We beat another Angel and we saved the life of a pilot, of my friend. I should go and visit him later today, they've had him under observation since the incident. Something about the potential risk of contamination. Misato has assured me that everything is alright though, he escaped with a few scrapes and bruises but he'll make a full recovery. Again, it's a stark contrast to the loss of his leg.  
NERV 的气氛轻松了许多。我们又击败了一个使徒，并救下了一位驾驶员，我的朋友。今天晚些时候我应该去探望他，自从那次事件后，他们一直让他接受观察。似乎是关于潜在的污染风险。美里向我保证一切都没事，他只是受了些擦伤和瘀伤，但会完全康复。再次对比之下，失去一条腿显得格外残酷。

Something catches my eye just to the side of Misato. I didn't see her before but there she is her eyes fixed on a portable games console. She looks up at me briefly and there is a hint of a smile on her face as she powers the console off. The smile is instantly replaced by a scowl.  
有什么东西吸引了我的注意，就在美里旁边。之前我没注意到她，但她现在正专注地盯着一台便携游戏机。她抬头看了我一眼，脸上露出一丝微笑，随即关掉了游戏机。那微笑立刻被皱眉所取代。

"Well Third, not bad but you're still going to have to do better than that to catch me up again."  
“好吧，第三，还不错，但要想再次赶上我，你还得做得更好。”

"Now now Asuka, an increase of 2.35% is still an increase. Besides you're probably just mad that you've lost our bet."  
"好了好了，明日香，增长 2.35%毕竟还是增长嘛。再说了，你大概只是因为输掉了我们的赌注而生气吧。"

A bet? They made a bet about me?  
赌注？他们拿我打赌了？

I look between the two of them, "A… A bet?"  
我来回看着他们两个，"一个……赌注？"

Misato nods, "Yeah… well um… we kinda had a bet on your score."  
美里点头，“嗯……呃……我们有点儿赌了你的分数。”

I can't help but sound disappointed. Is that why they're both here to greet me? So they can see who won their wager, "Oh…"  
我不禁听起来有些失望。他们俩来迎接我就是为了看谁赢了赌注吗，“哦……”

I think Asuka senses my disappointment because she cuts in instantly, "It wasn't like that! Why did you have to mention that Misato! It was… well…."  
我想明日香感觉到了我的失望，因为她立刻插话道，“不是那样的！美里，你干嘛非得提那个！那是……呃……”

"It's fine… it doesn't matter, I'm going to get a shower. Enjoy whatever it is you won Misato."  
"没事的…无所谓了，我去洗个澡。享受你从美里那里赢来的东西吧。"

I don't give either of them a chance to explain and just move past them both into the corridor which leads to my changing room. My good mood from earlier seems to have gone completely at that news. I sit down on one of the benches. I don't even know why I'm so mad at them for it. I guess I just expected them to be here because they cared about me, rather than something they could make a silly bet over. I sigh and the real reason comes into my head. It's because Asuka bet against me isn't it. Despite my efforts she just doesn't care and thinks I'm incapable.  
我没给他们任何解释的机会，径直从他们身边走过，进入通往更衣室的走廊。之前的好心情似乎因为这消息完全消失了。我坐在一张长椅上，甚至不知道自己为何对他们如此生气。我想我只是期望他们会因为关心我而来，而不是为了一个愚蠢的赌注。我叹了口气，真正的理由浮现在脑海中。是因为明日香赌我输，对吧。尽管我努力了，她还是不在乎，认为我不行。

Maybe I'm just mad because I'm still struggling to adapt to Asuka being this way. I keep having to remind myself that this isn't the Asuka from that place. This Asuka hasn't fought those Angel's, she hasn't had herself deconstructed mentally and physically nor has she had to face the things I did to her. This is the confident Asuka who still believes she is the best and her purpose is to pilot Eva. This is the Asuka who wants to reach out but is scared of doing so. I have to remind myself of that.  
也许我只是因为还在努力适应明日香这样的状态而生气。我不得不一再提醒自己，这不是那个地方的明日香。这个明日香没有与那些使徒战斗，没有经历精神和肉体上的解构，也没有面对我对她做过的那些事。这是自信的明日香，她仍然相信自己是最好的，她的使命是驾驶 EVA。这是想要伸出援手却又害怕这么做的明日香。我必须提醒自己这一点。

It does however hurt that she would bet against me with Misato. Especially after the concert the other night, after I thought I gave her the things she wanted. I know she probably doesn't mean any harm and I wasn't supposed to know about it but that isn't the point. I do know about it.  
然而，她与美里打赌反对我，这确实让我感到受伤。尤其是在前几天的音乐会之后，我以为我已经给了她想要的东西。我知道她可能并无恶意，我也不该知道这件事，但这并不是重点。我的确知道这件事。

I rise to my feet and the door to the locker room opens. That's strange, I'm the only male pilot and no one else has a reason to come in here. I stay quiet as the sound of footsteps approach me. I don't move as the person rounds the corner to where I am.  
我站起身来，更衣室的门打开了。这很奇怪，我是唯一的男性驾驶员，没有其他人有理由进入这里。我保持安静，听着脚步声向我靠近。当那人转过拐角来到我所在的地方时，我没有动。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She turns at the sound of my voice, "So there you are!"  
她听到我的声音转过身来，"原来你在这里！"

"Y-Yeah… I said I was going to get a shower, why are you here? This is the men's locker room?"  
"嗯……我说我要去洗澡了，你怎么在这儿？这是男更衣室啊？"

She approaches me and sits on the bench opposite me, "I came to explain the… bet to you."  
她走近我，坐在我对面的长椅上，"我来给你解释一下……那个赌约。"

"Oh… that." "哦……那个。"

"Yes… that. Look I…" “是的……那个。听着，我……”

I don't even give her a chance to begin explaining, "It doesn't matter, I can already guess. Misato said I'd go up a couple of points and you said I wouldn't. You lost and you're mad at me now. I'm sorry you think I'm so bad at this."  
我甚至没给她机会开始解释，“这无关紧要，我已经能猜到了。美里说我分数会上升一些，而你说我不会。你输了，现在生我的气。对不起，你觉得我在这方面很糟糕。”

She seems taken aback by how I sound. I have to admit I'm a little bit surprised at what I'm saying myself. I've argued with Asuka a number of times since she arrived but usually petty things like what to put on TV or whose turn it is to do laundry.  
她似乎被我的语气吓了一跳。我得承认，我自己也对自己说的话感到有点惊讶。自从她来到这里，我和明日香争吵过多次，但通常都是些琐事，比如看什么电视节目或轮到谁洗衣服。

She stands up and glares at me, "Actually… as usual, you're wrong."  
她站起身，瞪着我，"实际上……像往常一样，你错了。"

I sit back down and she towers over me forcing her finger into my chest. I look up straight into her eyes, "Our bet was on how many points you'd go up by. The loser of the bet has to buy you dinner. Misato said you'd improve by five percent maximum and I said you'd improve by ten percent…"  
我重新坐下，她居高临下地用手指戳着我的胸膛。我直视她的眼睛，"我们的赌注是你能提高多少分。输的人得请你吃饭。美里说你最多提高五个百分点，而我赌你能提高十个百分点……"

Ten percent? Asuka thought I'd go up that much? If I had gone up that much I'd have overtaken her significantly, it'd be a new record for me outside of the freak incidents when I achieved a one hundred percent sync ratio.  
十个百分点？明日香认为我能提高那么多？如果我真的提高了那么多，那我就会大幅超越她，这对我来说将是一个新纪录，除非是在那些我意外达到百分百同步率的特殊情况下。

"That… that's… you thought I'd go up by ten percent? That's impossible! I'd have beaten you… a-and…"  
"那…那可是…你以为我会提高百分之十？那是不可能的！我本可以打败你…而且…"

She prods me in the chest again, "I know it was impossible you idiot! There was little chance you'd catch me up…"  
她再次戳了戳我的胸口，"我知道那是不可能的，你这个傻瓜！你几乎没有机会追上我…"

"Y-you…. You lost on purpose?"  
"你…你…你是故意输的？"

She shakes her head, "No… I didn't lose! In fact I won, now hurry up and get showered and try to look happy. I booked this place yesterday and we have to be there soon."  
她摇摇头，“不……我没有输！实际上我赢了，快去洗澡，尽量显得开心点。我昨天订了这个地方，我们得快点过去。”

She turns to leave but just as she reaches the end of the row she turns around one last time, "By the way, wear the red shirt in your locker and the waist coat as well. I'll see you shortly."  
她转身离开，但就在她走到过道尽头时，她最后一次转过身来，“对了，穿上你储物柜里的红衬衫和背心。我们一会儿见。”

---

I finish buttoning up the new shirt Asuka left in my locker and stuff my older white shirt into my bag. I sling it over my shoulder and step out of the locker room. I'm expecting Asuka to meet me outside the room but instead I'm greeted by Dr Akagi. She much like Misato is suffering the effects of the Angel attack. She much like Misato has probably came back to NERV far too quickly. She, much like Misato has noticed the change in me.  
我扣好 Asuka 留在储物柜里的新衬衫，把旧的白衬衫塞进包里。我把包甩在肩上，走出更衣室。我以为 Asuka 会在门外等我，但迎接我的却是赤木律子博士。她和美里一样，受到了使徒攻击的影响。她和美里一样，可能回来得太快了。她，和美里一样，注意到了我的变化。

Dr Akagi scares me though. She's taken an interest in me since I came back. She keeps on trying to talk to me about my experiences. She keeps on trying to take samples of my blood and my DNA in the name of research. I keep on pretending nothing happened though but I have this feeling she doesn't believe me. It isn't just this that scares me though, I can still remember with great detail what happened to Rei. All those bodies just disintegrating in front of my eyes. Dozens of shells just melting into nothingness, all killed by Dr Akagi.  
赤木博士让我感到害怕。自从我回来后，她就对我产生了兴趣。她一直试图和我谈论我的经历。她以研究的名义不断试图采集我的血液和 DNA 样本。我一直在假装什么都没发生，但我有种感觉她并不相信我。不过，让我害怕的不仅仅是这些，我还能非常详细地记得丽发生的事情。那些身体就在我眼前化为乌有。数十个躯壳就这样融化成虚无，全都被赤木博士所杀。

It hasn't happened yet here but that is what she is capable of. That's why I can't act the same around her. It's why I can't act the same around Ayanami. The only people I can be myself around are Misato and Asuka.  
这里还没有发生过，但那是她能做到的。这就是为什么我在她周围不能表现得一样。这就是为什么我在绫波周围不能表现得一样。唯一能让我做自己的人是美里和明日香。

"Shinji, I've got something for you that you might be interested in."  
“真嗣，我有样东西你可能感兴趣。”

She holds something out to me, it's a small piece of card I take it from her and turn it over in my hand. I'm taken aback by the image on it. I can see an older woman, dark brown hair who I recognize as Ritsuko's mother. Next to her is a younger version of my father and next to him is my mother. My hand starts to tremble at the sight of it.  
她递给我一样东西，是一张小卡片。我从她手中接过，翻转着看。卡片上的图像让我吃了一惊。我看到一位年长的女士，深棕色的头发，我认出那是律子的母亲。她旁边是我父亲的年轻版本，再旁边是我的母亲。看到这一幕，我的手开始颤抖。

"I thought this when I was going through some of my old stuff the other night. I have no need for it anymore and I thought you might like it."  
“前几晚我整理旧物时发现了这张照片。我已经不需要它了，我想你可能会喜欢。”

My eyes wander to another figure on the photograph. Her face is familiar to me but I can't quite place who it is.  
我的目光移向照片上的另一个身影。她的面孔我似曾相识，但一时想不起是谁。

"Who is this?" "这是谁？"

Ritsuko hovers over my shoulder, "That's... Kyoko Zeppelin-Sohryu... Asuka's mother. This was taken in Germany back before NERV even existed and in the early days of Project E."  
律子悬在我的肩上，"那是... 绫波洋子-泽伦斯基... 明日香的母亲。这张照片是在 NERV 成立之前，在德国拍摄的，那时还是 E 计划早期。"

"Asuka's... mother..." "明日香... 的母亲..."

"Yes, she was... well it isn't my place to say but you and Asuka are more alike than you think. Although I suspect you already know that."  
"是的，她是……好吧，这不是我该说的，但你和明日香比你们想象的更相似。虽然我猜你已经知道了。"

I look up at her and she looks like she is expecting me to confess what I know. I can't shake the suspicion that she knows what I experienced but that's impossible. How could she know about that? All I do is nod.  
我抬头看她，她似乎在期待我坦白我所知道的事情。我无法摆脱她知道我经历过的怀疑，但那是不可能的。她怎么可能知道那些？我只是点了点头。

"I know that her mother died... but that's about it."  
"我知道她母亲去世了……但也就这些了。"

"I see, well like I said it isn't my place to discuss it. You can keep that anyway and congratulations on your point increase. Although I must say I disapprove of Katsuragi and your fellow pilot putting a wager on you. They should be taking this more seriously."  
"我明白了，正如我所说，这不是我该讨论的事。你尽管留着吧，恭喜你的分数提升。不过我得说，我不同意桂木和你的另一位驾驶员拿你打赌。他们应该更认真对待这件事。"

"Y-You knew about that?" "你……你知道这件事？"

"Katsuragi mentioned it. I believe Asuka will be taking you out for dinner now?"  
"桂木提过。我想明日香现在会带你去吃晚餐吧？"

I nod, "Yeah... that's right."  
我点头，“嗯...没错。”

"In which case I won't keep you any longer. Goodbye Shinji."  
“既然如此，我就不多留你了。再见，真嗣。”

We say our goodbyes and she walks down the corridor away from me. I stare at the photograph in my hand for a moment transfixed not by my parents but by Asuka's mother. I can see the resemblance now in her face, they both share the same determined eyes and the same smile. I know what happened to this woman. I know why Asuka has those nightmares and why she needs me to hold her at night sometimes.  
我们互道再见，她沿着走廊离我而去。我凝视着手中的照片，一时出神，不是因为我的父母，而是因为明日香的母亲。现在我能看出她们面容上的相似之处，她们都有着同样坚定的眼神和同样的微笑。我知道这个女人的遭遇。我知道明日香为何会有那些噩梦，为何有时需要我在夜里抱着她。

"Hey idiot, we're on a schedule here!"  
"嘿，傻瓜，我们这儿可是有计划的！"

My thoughts are interupted by Asuka's voice. I quickly shove the picture in my bag before she can see it and look towards her. Earlier when I saw her she was wearing her school uniform but now she's changed. She must have done so while she was waiting for me. She's now in a long purple dress, accompanied with gloves. Around the middle is a pretty lighter purple ribbon. Her red hair has been straightened and the Neural Clips in her hair replaced by bows matching the colour of the dress. I can see a necklace around her neck and for a moment I'm just transfixed by her beauty. Everything about her is so perfect.  
我的思绪被明日香的声音打断。我迅速将照片塞进包里，以免她看到，然后转向她。之前见到她时她还穿着校服，但现在她换了衣服。她一定是在等我的时候换的。她现在穿着一件长长的紫色连衣裙，搭配着手套。腰部系着一条漂亮的浅紫色丝带。她的红发已经拉直，头发上的神经夹被与裙子颜色相配的蝴蝶结取代。我可以看到她脖子上戴着一条项链，有那么一刻，我完全被她的美丽所吸引。她的一切都是那么完美。

"Y-You look... beautiful."  
"你看起来... 真美。"

She actually seems shocked by me complimenting her. Of course she is, she wouldn't expect me to say something like that. Usually I'd just stutter or grow silent. A blush spreads across her cheeks followed by a smile.  
她听到我夸她，竟然显得很惊讶。当然会这样，她没想到我会说出这样的话。通常我只会结巴或者沉默。她的脸颊泛起红晕，随后露出了微笑。

"Well... of course I do, now come on."  
“嗯……当然啦，快点过来。”

**Day 10 第 10 天**

This morning I woke up with a song stuck in my head. It was The Musical Box by Genesis, the first track off of Nursery Cryme. I remember the time me and Asuka listened to that album when we were stuck in the apartment in that other place. I had asked a silly question about one of the songs and we just lay there in each other's arms listening to it. I don't know why I had it stuck in my head this morning. I hadn't heard it in so long but this morning it was there, as if I had been listening to it myself on my SDAT.  
今早醒来，脑海中萦绕着一首歌。是 Genesis 乐队的《The Musical Box》，来自专辑《Nursery Cryme》的首曲。我记得那次和明日香被困在那个地方的公寓里，我们一起听那张专辑的时光。我问了一个关于其中一首歌的傻问题，我们就那样躺在彼此的怀里听着。不知道为什么今早这首歌会突然在脑海中响起。我已经很久没听过它了，但今早它就在那里，仿佛我自己一直在用 SDAT 播放它。

I stare at the maths problem on the laptop screen in front of me and sigh. In the background I can hear the droning of our teacher once again talking about life before Second Impact and how it changed the world. Maybe I should get up there and talk about my life after the Third Impact and what I'm going to do now to avoid it.  
我盯着笔记本屏幕上的数学题，叹了口气。背景中，老师又在喋喋不休地讲述第二次冲击前的生活以及它如何改变了世界。也许我该上去谈谈第三次冲击后的生活，以及我现在打算做些什么来避免它。

I wonder how many times we've heard these stories. This class full of rapidly dwindling numbers. I look around at the familiar faces. Asuka sitting a couple of rows in front of me, Hikari next to her. Kensuke sat near to me and an empty seat next to him where Touji would be. By the window is Ayanami, her head resting on her hand and her absentmindedly looking out of the window. I don't think that in the time since I arrived I've ever seen her do any work whilst in classes. I've never spoke to her about grades or difficulty with homework. Our conversations are short, to the point and usually about Eva or my father. They usually have some sort of weirdness attached to them.  
我想知道这些故事我们听过多少遍了。这个班级的人数正迅速减少。我环顾四周，熟悉的脸庞映入眼帘。明日香坐在我前面几排，旁边是光。真嗣坐在我附近，他旁边是通常会有冬二坐的空座位。靠窗的位置是绫波，她一手托腮，心不在焉地望着窗外。自从我来到这里，似乎从未见过她在课堂上做过任何作业。我从未与她谈及成绩或作业难题。我们的对话简短、直接，通常围绕着 EVA 或我的父亲。这些对话总带着些许怪异。

I've never argued with Ayanami outside of the time she slapped me and even then that wasn't an argument that was just her slapping me because I made a comment about my father. It's even harder for me now because I know what Ayanami is, I know why she was created and why she is the way she is. That should make it easier for me to talk to her and to want to help her but it just makes things more awkward. What am I supposed to say to her? That I know she's a clone of my mother infused with the DNA of the second Angel? That she may as well be my sister biologically? That I know she is the second Ayanami?  
我从未与绫波在非她掌掴我的场合争论过，即便那次也并非争论，只是因为她对我关于父亲的评论不满而动手。如今这对我来说更加困难，因为我了解绫波的本质，明白她为何被创造，以及她为何如此。这本应让我更容易与她交流并渴望帮助她，但实际上却让事情变得更加尴尬。我该对她说什么？告诉她我知道她是融合了我母亲基因与第二使徒 DNA 的克隆体？告诉她从生物学角度她几乎算是我的姐妹？告诉她我知道她是第二个绫波？

Thankfully before I can get too lost in these thoughts the bell finally rings to signify the end of the lesson and the day. I go through the routine of standing, bowing and sitting and begin to power off the laptop. I hear Hikari call over to me that myself and Ayanami have clean-up duty tonight. I had forgotten all about that. Yet another reminder of the strange life I lead. I'm an Evangelion pilot, charged with saving the world. Yet here I'm just another student, I have to perform the same routine the others do and I have to take part in the same chores the others do. I kind of like that though, I don't want people to treat me any differently because of my status, I want people to treat me like I'm me.  
幸好，在我过于沉浸于这些思绪之前，铃声终于响起，标志着课程和这一天的结束。我按照惯例站起、鞠躬、坐下，并开始关闭笔记本电脑。我听到光叫我，说我和绫波今晚有打扫任务。我完全忘记了这件事。这又是我过着奇异生活的另一个提醒。我是一名《新世纪福音战士》驾驶员，肩负着拯救世界的重任。然而在这里，我只是另一个学生，我必须执行与其他人相同的日常，参与同样的家务。不过，我有点喜欢这样，我不希望人们因为我的身份而区别对待我，我希望人们像对待我一样对待我。

Without any words I go to the cupboard and watch as the last few people leave the room. Asuka is the last one to leave, as she does so she turns and gives me a glance. For a time she opens her mouth as if she wants to say something but then she just waves goodbye and leaves. She's been like that all day, looking at me as if she wants to say something but hasn't. Last night she took me out for dinner, she paid for me and we talked. We held each other's hands over the table and held each other's hand on the way home. I made her some tea when we got back to Misato's and we just sat on the couch with her cuddling into me all night. We didn't speak, we didn't have to we were comfortable with the silence. When it was time to go to bed she asked if she could spend the night with me. She didn't even tease me about being a pervert. She just climbed into my bed and I held her.  
没有言语，我走向橱柜，看着最后几个人离开房间。明日香是最后一个离开的，她转身给了我一个眼神。有那么一会儿，她张开嘴似乎想说些什么，但最终只是挥手告别，离开了。她一整天都是这样，看着我好像想说些什么却又没说。昨晚她带我去吃了晚餐，她为我买单，我们聊了很多。我们在餐桌上握着彼此的手，回家的路上也一直牵着手。回到美里家后，我给她泡了些茶，我们就坐在沙发上，她整晚都依偎在我怀里。我们没有说话，不需要，我们享受着沉默的舒适。到了睡觉时间，她问我是否可以和我一起过夜。她甚至没有取笑我是变态。她只是爬上了我的床，我抱着她。

I grab a broom and turn around and I'm started by Ayanami being stood in very close proximity. I guess I was so wrapped up in my thoughts about Asuka I didn't hear her. Or was that intentional? Ayanami is a very quiet person.  
我拿起扫帚转过身，惊讶地发现绫波零站在非常近的地方。我想我太沉浸在对明日香的思考中，以至于没听到她的到来。还是说这是故意的？绫波零是个非常安静的人。

"Ikari… I have a question."  
“碇君……我有个问题。”

I move past her and begin to sweep one of the corners of the room, "You do?"  
我绕过她，开始清扫房间的一个角落，“你真的？”

"What… is it to be in love?"  
“什么是……陷入爱河的感觉？”

I stop sweeping. Ayanami has been thinking about love? Is there someone in this class she loves? Or is it something else? Why would she ask me and not my father or Akagi? She spends her life around those two after all. In truth I don't even know how to answer that question. I am in love, I'm in love with Asuka but putting those feelings into words is difficult. I also don't really want anyone to know about that, aside from Asuka.  
我停下了扫地的动作。绫波一直在思考爱情吗？是班上有她爱的人吗？还是别的什么？为什么她会问我而不是我父亲或赤木律子？毕竟她一生中大部分时间都是和他们两人在一起的。说实话，我甚至不知道该如何回答这个问题。我确实在恋爱，我爱着明日香，但将这些情感用言语表达出来却很难。我也不太想让任何人知道这件事，除了明日香。

"I… don't really know." "我…真的不太清楚。"

"But you are in love."  
"但你确实爱上了。"

"I-I am?" "我…我爱上了吗？"

"With the Second, I have observed the way you look at her and act around her. You have both been on what many would call 'dates' together, are you not in love with her?"  
"对于第二，我注意到你看她的眼神和与她相处的方式。你们一起经历了许多人称之为‘约会’的事情，难道你不爱她吗？"

Ayanami is more observant than I first thought and she is smarter than I thought.  
绫波比我想象中更细心，也比我想象中更聪明。

"I… well…" "我…呃…"

If I told Ayanami about my feelings for Asuka what difference would it make?  
如果我向绫波坦白我对明日香的感情，会有什么改变呢？

"Yes… I love Asuka. I don't know how to put those feelings into words, I… I want to protect her and be around her at all times. I want to hold her and make her smile… I…"  
“是的……我爱明日香。我不知道如何用言语表达这些情感，我……我想保护她，时刻陪伴在她身边。我想拥抱她，让她微笑……我……”

I realize I'm smiling myself as I say these words, "When I'm near her I'm happy and I actually like who I am. I guess that is what it is to be in love."  
我意识到自己在说这些话时也在微笑，“当我在她身边时，我感到快乐，也真正喜欢自己。我想，这就是恋爱的感觉吧。”

"I see and she feels the same way about you?"  
"我看得出来，她也对你有同样的感觉吗？"

I shake my head, "I don't know, I hope she does but I have not told her about my feelings."  
我摇摇头，“我不知道，我希望她也有，但我还没告诉她我的感情。”

"You fear rejection?" "你害怕被拒绝吗？"

Nodding I continue, "I guess… but I guess… I'm also waiting for the right moment."  
我点点头继续说，“我想……但我想……我也在等待合适的时机。”

"What would be the right moment?"  
“什么才是合适的时机呢？”

I shrug, "I don't know… I guess when we're both alone and walking along some nice beach with the sun setting in the distance. Something romantic like that."  
我耸耸肩，“我不知道……我想是在我们俩都独自一人，沿着美丽的海滩散步，远处夕阳西下的时候。那种浪漫的场景。”

She tilts her head curiously at me as I confess my silly romantic fantasy about Asuka to her. It sounds so silly when I say it out loud especially when I know it doesn't work like that. In that other place we just said we loved each other, there wasn't any grand romance there was just… love that grew. I guess this will be the same.  
她好奇地歪着头听我坦白对明日香那傻乎乎的浪漫幻想。说出口时听起来真是傻得可笑，尤其是我知道事情并非那样运作的。在那个我们只说了爱对方的地方，并没有什么宏大的浪漫，只有……逐渐滋生的爱。我想这里也会是一样的。

"So love is always romantic?"  
“所以爱总是浪漫的吗？”

Shaking my head I start sweeping again, "Not always, you can love someone and it not be romantic. You can love family members. I love Misato because she is my guardian, she cares for me and gives me a home. I love my friends because they are my friends. I love y-"  
我摇摇头，又开始扫地，“并非总是，你可以爱一个人而不带浪漫色彩。你可以爱家人。我爱美里，因为她是我监护人，她关心我并给我一个家。我爱我的朋友，因为他们是我的朋友。我爱……”

I stop myself before I say the words 'I love you like I'd love a sister', I'm not supposed to know that yet.  
我及时止住自己，没说出那句‘我爱你就像爱一个妹妹’，我本不该知道这些的。

"Family… do you love your father?"  
“家人……你爱你的父亲吗？”

I stop for a moment as a familiar feeling hits the pit of my stomach. Do I love my father? I guess I do, despite all he has done and all he is doing I love him purely because he is my father and I can't eliminate that feeling. I long for him to care about me and acknowledge me. I know he doesn't because he is scared but that doesn't justify it. I can't bring myself to now love him though. Asuka once told me in that other place that is it that sort of thing that makes me a brave person. That I can still love someone despite what they may do. I think she was referring more to what she had done but it applied to him as well.  
我停顿片刻，一种熟悉的感觉涌上心头。我爱我的父亲吗？我想我是爱的，尽管他所做的一切和他正在做的一切，我纯粹因为他是我的父亲而爱他，那种感觉无法抹去。我渴望他关心我、认可我。我知道他因为害怕而不这样做，但这并不能成为理由。尽管如此，我现在还是无法不爱他。明日香曾在那个地方告诉我，正是这种情感让我成为一个勇敢的人。即使别人做了什么，我依然能够去爱。我想她更多是指她自己所做的事，但也适用于他。

I nod slowly, "I do… but I don't like my father."  
我缓缓点头，“我确实……但我并不喜欢我的父亲。”

I expect her to walk towards me and slap me again or question me angrily. She doesn't do either, instead she focuses on cleaning the desk and looks of vacantly. Many people in this class don't understand Ayanami. Many people in NERV don't understand her and I know for a fact Asuka doesn't understand her nor does she like her. They see Ayanami as an emotionless doll but I know that isn't true. Ayanami has emotions but because she was raised the way she was she doesn't understand them. She doesn't know how to process them nor does she understand the actions of those in our class.  
"我以为她会朝我走来，再次扇我一巴掌或愤怒地质问我。她两者都没有做，而是专注于清理桌子，眼神空洞。这个班上很多人都不理解绫波。NERV 里很多人也不理解她，我确信明日香既不理解她也不喜欢她。他们把绫波看作一个没有感情的玩偶，但我知道事实并非如此。绫波有情感，但因为她被养育的方式，她不理解这些情感。她不知道如何处理它们，也不理解我们班上其他人的行为。”

I wonder for a moment then how she feels about my father, "Ayanami… how do you feel about my father?"  
我一时好奇，想知道她对我父亲的感觉，“绫波……你对我父亲有什么感觉？”

"I… I do not know… when I am around him I feel comfortable. I feel safe and happy. He wants to protect me…"  
"我…我不知道…当他身边时，我感到舒适。我觉得安全和快乐。他想要保护我…"

I try to not let those words eat at me or I at least try to not let it show. I know most of that is because he is using her but I can't deny her feelings are that of love for him as a father.  
我尽量不让这些话困扰我，至少尽量不让它表现出来。我知道大部分原因是他在利用她，但我不能否认她对他的感情是像对父亲一样的爱。

"You… love him as a father?"  
"你…把他当作父亲来爱？"

She nods, "I… think so. I feel the same way around you… I feel safe and protected. Is this also love?"  
她点点头，“我……我想是的。在你身边，我感到安全和被保护。这也是爱吗？”

Of course it is, because we share a bond. My father is your father Ayanami, whether or not you know this fully I don't know but it's true. I want to protect you.  
当然是，因为我们之间有羁绊。我的父亲是你的父亲绫波，无论你是否完全知晓，这都是事实。我想保护你。

I shake my head, "I don't know… only you can answer that. It's something that is just there, you know it when you feel it but you can't explain it."  
我摇摇头，“我不清楚……只有你能回答。这是一种自然而然存在的感觉，你知道它何时出现，却无法解释。”

"I see… thank you." "我明白了…谢谢你。"

I continue my sweeping going from one end of the classroom to another. She speaks again.  
我继续从教室的一头扫到另一头。她再次开口。

"Ikari… I think… until you arrived I did not know the meaning of having a family. You and the Second have helped me understand."  
"碇…我想…在你到来之前，我并不懂得家庭的意义。你和第二适格者帮助我理解了这一点。"

"W-We have?" "我们有过吗？"

"Yes, I realize that I do see the Commander as a father figure but… in you and Sohryu I have what might be similar to a Brother and a Sister. I would like to… protect you all when I am inside Eva."  
"是的，我意识到我把指挥官看作父亲般的人物，但在你和长龙身上，我感受到了类似兄妹的情感。我希望……在 Eva 里时能保护你们所有人。"

I nod, "I feel the same."  
我点头，"我也一样。"

**Day 11 第 11 天**

I don't know how much time we have until the next Angel attacks, my memory is a little bit hazy of this time but if I remember correctly it will be this afternoon when it does. That is if things do go the same way as the other time. I was correct about Touji but I don't know how my actions there might have affected anything else. I don't know anything about the Angels and how they work, why they attack the way they do. It could be that in that other place the Angel knew about the events that had occurred and attacked knowing we were weakened. Or maybe they just attack when they can, it isn't like we can communicate with them.  
我不知道我们还有多少时间，直到下一个使徒袭击，我的记忆对此有些模糊。但如果我没记错的话，应该是今天下午。前提是事情按照上次那样发展。我对铃原的判断是正确的，但我不确定我的行为是否影响了其他事情。我对使徒一无所知，不了解它们的工作原理，为什么它们会以这种方式攻击。可能在上一次，使徒知道发生的事件，知道我们被削弱了，所以发动了攻击。或者它们只是随时攻击，毕竟我们无法与它们沟通。

Apparently what happened to me was an attempt to communicate with humans. I wonder if communicate was successful would we then be able to stop the conflicts or is that just inevitable. It isn't just the next Angel that concerns me though, the ones after that worry me leading up until the last one. Kaworu.  
显然，对我发生的事情是试图与人类沟通的一次尝试。我在想，如果沟通成功，我们是否能停止冲突，还是说那只是不可避免的。不过，让我担忧的不仅仅是下一个使徒，还有之后的那些，一直到最后的那个——渚薰。

Kaworu, the boy who said he loved me. That was the first time I had heard those words said to me and in the end he betrayed me. Yet there was something about him, he didn't want to betray me but he had to. He was forced to. I wonder if he is alive now and if he is what he is doing. Is he happy? Is he learning about us and training in an Evangelion in a facility somewhere. Does he attend school? There is so much I don't know about him, yet when I met him I was drawn to him.  
渚薰，那个说他爱我的男孩。那是我第一次听到有人对我说出这样的话，最终他却背叛了我。然而，他身上有些东西让我觉得，他并非真心想背叛，而是被迫如此。我不知道他现在是否还活着，他在做什么。他快乐吗？他是否在某个设施里学习关于我们的知识，驾驶着 EVA 进行训练。他上学吗？关于他，我还有很多不知道的，但当我遇见他时，我被他深深吸引。

He said he loved me and I loved him. Was it romantic? It was definitely different to how I feel about Asuka but at the same time I still felt a connection with him. I would have been happy to hold his hand, be held by him and maybe kiss him. I've never thought about my sexuality in that way before. I wonder what the others would say if they knew about that. If they knew I was bisexual. Would they understand?  
他说他爱我，我也爱他。这是浪漫的吗？这肯定不同于我对明日香的感情，但同时我仍然与他有着某种联系。我本可以很高兴地牵他的手，被他拥抱，甚至亲吻他。我以前从未以这种方式思考过我的性取向。我想知道如果其他人知道这件事会怎么说。如果他们知道我是双性恋。他们会理解吗？

Regardless that isn't what worries me. What worries me is that what will happen when or if he shows up this time. I know what he is from the beginning, and things are different now so he likely won't approach me in the same way. Would he go straight for Lilith this time? Would my words affect him in the same way? I wish I knew more about you Kaworu, just who were you?  
尽管那并不是我担心的。我真正担心的是，如果这次他真的出现，会发生什么。从一开始我就知道他的本质，现在情况不同了，所以他可能不会再以同样的方式接近我。这次他会直接去找莉莉丝吗？我的话还会对他产生同样的影响吗？我真希望我能更了解你，渚薰，你究竟是谁？

I'm snapped out of my thoughts by a hand squeezing mine. I turn and see Asuka glaring at me and I come to the realization that I've been so wrapped up in my thoughts I've barely said a word to her. There is somewhere I want to take her this morning, if the Angel does attack then it might be the only chance she gets to see this. I also want to visit him, to maybe try and steer him off of the path he is on. I don't quite know how yet but maybe the sight of me and Asuka as a couple might make him realize he shouldn't risk what he has with Misato.  
我的思绪被一只紧握我的手打断。我转头看到明日香正瞪着我，我这才意识到自己完全沉浸在思考中，几乎没怎么和她说话。今天早上我想带她去一个地方，如果使徒真的发动攻击，那可能是她唯一能看到的机会。我也想去找他，试图让他偏离现在的道路。虽然我还不太清楚该怎么做，但也许看到我和明日香在一起的样子，会让他意识到他不应该冒险失去和美里在一起的机会。

"Shinji, are you going to tell me where you're taking me yet?"  
“真嗣，你到底要带我去哪儿？”

I shake my head, "Not yet, trust me you'll be surprised."  
我摇摇头，“还没呢，相信我，你会大吃一惊的。”

She lets out a laugh, "You woke me up this morning with packed lunches, told me we're skipping school and that you wanted me to see something. I'm already surprised. Don't expect me to cover for you when Misato finds out what we did though! This is all your idea."  
她笑出声来，“你今早把我叫醒，准备了便当，告诉我我们要逃课，还说要带我看什么东西。我已经很惊讶了。不过别指望我会在 Misato 发现后帮你打掩护！这都是你的主意。”

I nod in agreement, "I know... I don't mind. It's... worth it to be with you."  
我点头表示同意，“我知道...我不在乎。能和你在一起...值得。”

She offers no response as we continue walking down the road. A number of gardens and vegetable plots surround us on either side. I keep my eyes out for the watermelon patch belonging to Kaji.  
她没有回应，我们继续沿着道路前行。两侧环绕着许多花园和菜地。我留意着寻找属于加持的西瓜地。

"I didn't realize all of this was here in the Geofront."  
“我没想到地底下还有这么多东西。”

I'm about to respond to her when finally I see him emerging from his shed, a shovel in his hand. Suddenly I feel Asuka's hand slip away from mine.  
我正要回答她，终于看到他拿着铁锹从棚屋里走出来。突然间，我感觉到明日香的手从我的手中滑落。

"Kaji!" "加持！"

She yells and runs straight towards him. I smile knowingly as he turns to greet us. The same warm smile on his face that he usually had.  
她大喊着径直朝他跑去。我心领神会地笑了，他转过身来迎接我们，脸上挂着他一贯的温暖笑容。

"Oh! Hey… Guess you found my little secret place then."  
“哦！嘿……看来你找到了我的小秘密基地。”

I walk over to where he is and crouch down looking as confused as I can be over the round green items in the ground.  
我走到他所在的地方，蹲下来，装出一副对地上那些圆滚滚的绿色物体困惑不已的样子。

"Melons?" "瓜？"

Asuka grabs hold of his free arm and looks up at him, "You grow these?"  
明日香抓住他空着的手臂，抬头看着他，"你种这些？"

"It's my hobby, something I have quite some time for seeing as I'm not needed in NERV these days. So here I am, looking after my little garden."  
"这是我的爱好，最近在 NERV 没什么需要我做的，所以我就来照顾我的小花园了。"

Asuka looks around at the patch of melons, "They're huge!"  
明日香环顾着这片瓜地，惊叹道：“它们好大啊！”

He nods and then his expression suddenly changes to one of concern, "What are you two doing down here? Shouldn't you both me in school?"  
他点点头，随即表情突然转为关切，问道：“你们俩在这儿做什么？不应该在学校吗？”

"Oh that… well…" “哦，那个啊……嗯……”

I start to speak but Asuka cuts me off, "Oh it's so pointless at the moment Kaji! There are barely any people in there and besides I already have a college education."  
我刚要开口，但明日香打断了我，“哦，现在这太没意义了，加持！那里几乎没什么人，而且我已经有大学学历了。”

"Indeed, but what about Shinji?"  
“确实，但真嗣怎么办？”

She looks at me and laughs, "Shinji? Half of what he does in that class is from what I tell him anyway! All our teacher does is ramble about before the Second Impact. Why do people like that dwell so much on the past?"  
她看着我笑了，“真嗣？他那堂课上做的一半事情都是我告诉他的！我们的老师只会喋喋不休地谈论第二次冲击之前的事。为什么人们那么喜欢沉溺于过去呢？”

For a brief moment we all look at each other realizing the irony of what Asuka has said. What is our collection of people in and around NERV but people who dwell on the past? Kaji however steps forward confidently.  
有那么一瞬间，我们都互相看着对方，意识到明日香所说的话中的讽刺意味。我们这一群在 NERV 内外的人，不正是一群沉溺于过去的人吗？然而，加持却自信地走上前。

"Sometimes Asuka, remembering the past is a way of safeguarding our future. If we dismiss that that came before we may lead us to make the same mistakes. Yet while that is true, sometimes dwelling on our pasts can lead us to make even worse mistakes. It is about balance, perhaps your teacher is trying to convey a message to you all. To be mindful of your role moving forward through your education, or maybe it is as you say the ramblings of an old man."  
“有时候，明日香，回忆过去是保护我们未来的方式。如果我们忽视了之前发生的事情，可能会导致我们重蹈覆辙。然而，尽管这是真的，有时沉溺于过去可能会让我们犯下更严重的错误。关键在于平衡，也许你的老师正试图向你们传达一个信息。要留意你们在教育过程中前进的角色，或者也许正如你所说，那只是一个老人的胡言乱语。”

"I much prefer to move forward, what's the point of dwelling in the past. It's not like we can redo it."  
“我更喜欢向前看，沉溺于过去有什么意义呢。我们又不能重来一遍。”

_'You cannot redo.' '你无法重来。'_

A line me and Asuka in that other place used to say to one another. It was our way of reminding each other that we had shed that which we had done in the past and moving to make ourselves better. Each time we felt our hatred for ourselves creeping in and reminding us of who we were we would talk and we'd remind ourselves of that. It was a way of accepting who we were and vowing to be better. Except… it wasn't true was it? That's what I'm doing right now. I am redoing that which came before.  
我和明日香在那个地方时常互说的一句话。这是我们提醒彼此已经抛开了过去的所作所为，并努力变得更好的方式。每当自我憎恨悄然袭来，提醒我们曾是怎样的人时，我们会交谈，提醒自己这一点。这是一种接受自我并誓言变得更好的方式。只是……这并不真实，对吧？我现在所做的正是重蹈覆辙。

The Angel I was trapped in gave me a glimpse of a possible future and I'm working to change it. I wonder though… would they do the same?  
困住我的使徒让我瞥见了一个可能的未来，而我正努力改变它。不过，我在想……他们会这样做吗？

"Would you though… if you could?"  
"不过，如果你能的话，你会吗？"

"What'd be the point, I'm perfect as I am."  
"有什么意义呢，我这样已经很完美了。"

She brushes off the question quickly and without even thinking about it.  
她迅速且不经思考地忽略了这个问题。

"What about you Kaji?" “那你呢，加持？”

He pauses and thinks about it for a moment, "There are moments I might do again, maybe correct some mistakes I made regarding Katsuragi but it was those mistakes that led to us being here right now in this situation and having this conversation. So who knows how altering that would change things?"  
他顿了顿，沉思片刻，“有些时刻我可能会想重来，也许修正一些我对葛城犯下的错误，但正是这些错误让我们现在处于这种境地，进行这场对话。所以谁知道改变那些会带来什么变化呢？”

I watch for Asuka's reaction when he mentions Kaji. Strangely enough she doesn't flinch or show a hint of jealousy like she might have done before. Is that because of me? I throw the thought out of my mind, that isn't the point of me asking Kaji these questions.  
当他说到加持时，我留意着明日香的反应。奇怪的是，她并没有退缩或流露出一丝嫉妒，这要放在以前她可能会这么做。是因为我吗？我抛开这个念头，我问加持这些问题并不是为了这个。

"But if it meant you and Misato would be happier?"  
"但如果这意味着你和美里会更幸福呢？"

"I think the time for me and Misato to find our happiness has gone now. So much has happened. You kids wouldn't understand."  
"我想我和美里寻找幸福的时间已经过去了。发生了太多事情。你们这些孩子不会理解的。"

"She cares about you, a lot. Maybe it isn't too late."  
"她很在乎你，非常在乎。也许还不算太晚。"

The smile, the confidence fades from him by my outburst. Asuka looks slightly taken aback as well. It is out of character for me to say something like that but I have a chance to avert a tragedy here. My character be damned, only Asuka and Kaji can see and hear me.  
我的爆发让他脸上的笑容和自信逐渐消失。明日香也显得有些惊讶。我平时不会说这种话，但这次有机会避免一场悲剧。我的形象算什么，只有明日香和加持能看到并听到我。

Finally he laughs, "Maybe it isn't… but you never answered my question. What are you both doing here? I would have thought the GeoFront would have been the last place you'd want to visit."  
他终于笑了，“也许不是……但你从未回答我的问题。你们俩在这里做什么？我本以为地底都市会是你们最不想去的地方。”

Asuka looks at me, she already covered for me on the school thing but it was me who brought us here. I wonder what she wants me to say, is this a date? Was last night a date? We never really discussed it. Are we a couple because we've been holding each other's hand when we're out and holding each other at home?  
明日香看着我，她已经在学校的事情上为我打过掩护，但带我们来这里的是我。我不知道她想让我说什么，这是一次约会吗？昨晚是约会吗？我们从未真正讨论过。我们是不是一对，因为我们在外面牵手，在家互相拥抱？

"It was… I thought it'd be nice for us to come here. I saw the gardens and wondered about it and mentioned it to Asuka."  
"我以为……我们一起来这里会很好。我看到了这些花园，觉得挺有意思，就告诉了明日香。"

"I see, well… it's nice to see you both getting along so well. I know Katsuragi was concerned about you both at one point but I knew you'd get along just fine. After all, you're both more alike than you both think."  
"我明白了，嗯……看到你们俩相处得这么好真是太好了。我知道葛城小姐曾经担心过你们，但我一直相信你们会相处得很好。毕竟，你们比自己想象的还要相似。"

Kaji quickly realizes he might have said too much with the last sentence, "Still I wouldn't be doing my job as a responsible adult if I didn't remind you both again about the dangers of skipping school. Even if it is, as you both said pointless."  
加持很快意识到自己可能说得太多了，"不过，如果我不再次提醒你们作为负责任的成年人，逃学的危险，那我就失职了。即使像你们说的那样毫无意义。"

"S-Sorry…" "对-对不起…"

"It isn't me you have to apologize to Shinji, it's only your own grades and Katsuragi."  
"真嗣，你要道歉的不是我，而是你自己的成绩和葛城。"

"Yeah I know." "嗯，我知道。"

He smiles at us both and Asuka releases he grip on him and moves to my side. I open my mouth to say something else, to offer more small talk but I'm cut off by the sound of sirens. My heart drops and a sick feeling appears in the pit of my stomach. It's time. The next Angel has been sighted.  
他朝我们俩微笑，明日香松开了抓着他的手，移到我身边。我张开嘴想说些什么，想继续闲聊，却被警笛声打断。我的心沉了下去，胃里涌起一阵恶心感。时候到了。下一个使徒已被发现。

"I guess that's your cue…"  
“我想那是你的信号……”

Asuka looks at him, "You should probably go to a shelter or NERV."  
明日香看着他，“你最好去避难所或 NERV。”

Kaji shakes his head, "I'm fine here. Like I said I'm not exactly needed at NERV at the moment and I'm safe where I am. Besides, if I die I can't think of a better place to do it. Amongst that which I helped bring into this world and nurture."  
加持摇了摇头，“我在这里很好。就像我说的，我现在并不特别需要去 NERV，而且我待的地方很安全。再说了，如果我死了，我想不出比这里更好的地方了。在我亲手带入这个世界并培育的东西之间。”

I step forward, "B-But what about Misato… and… don't you have family too? I'm sure they'd want you to be safe…"  
我走上前，“但……美里呢……还有……你不是也有家人吗？我相信他们一定希望你安全……”

The smile remains but his eyes change when I mention family. They are a look I've never seen from Kaji before, a fire… anger perhaps. I've seen the same look from myself when I've looked in the mirror before getting in the Eva. Is he thinking about Misato, is he thinking about his sister?  
他的笑容依旧，但当我提到家人时，他的眼神变了。那是我从未在加持眼中见过的神情，一种火焰……或许是愤怒。我在进入 Eva 前照镜子时也见过自己这样的眼神。他在想美里吗，还是在想他的妹妹？

"Unfortunately I lost most of my family as a consequence of Second Impact. My sister is safe in Germany right now though and besides I have faith in you both in protecting us all. Now go, before Katsuragi finds out about my little hobby."  
“不幸的是，第二次冲击让我失去了大部分家人。不过我妹妹目前在德国很安全，而且我相信你们俩会保护我们所有人的。现在快走吧，别让葛城发现我的小爱好。”

We approach the corridor where it splits off towards our locker rooms. The sirens are still blaring all around us, despite this the corridor is empty. My heart is racing, not because we ran but because of what this Angel can do. I'm terrified of it. I'm really scared of what might happen to Asuka, or Ayanami or Misato or even myself. I don't want to get trapped in my Eva for thirty days again, I don't want Asuka to face that sort of pain again.  
我们走近那条通往更衣室的走廊分岔口。警报声依旧在我们周围响个不停，尽管如此，走廊里却空无一人。我的心跳加速，不是因为我们奔跑，而是因为这个使徒能做的事情。我害怕它。我真的害怕阿斯卡、绫波或美里，甚至我自己会发生什么。我不想再次被困在 EVA 里三十天，我不希望阿斯卡再次承受那种痛苦。

There is something else I want to do before this though. I stop at the corner of the corridor and call out to Asuka.  
不过，在此之前我还有一件事想做。我在走廊的拐角处停下，向阿斯卡喊道。

"What is it Shinji, not sure if you've realized but there is an Angel attacking us right now and I need to get out there and kick its ass."  
"怎么了，真嗣，你可能还没意识到，但现在有一个使徒正在攻击我们，我得出去狠狠揍它一顿。"

"I… I know that but… I… I'm scared and-"  
"我……我知道，但是……我……我害怕，而且——"

She sighs and walks over to me, "Scared?"  
她叹了口气，走到我身边，"害怕？"

She flicks me on the forehead, "What do you have to be scared of? Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. Now is that all?"  
她在我额头上轻弹了一下，“你有什么好怕的？跟着我就行了，不会有事的。就这些吗？”

"Yea- No… Asuka I…" “嗯——不……明日香，我……”

The words get caught in my throat. She tilts her head at me curiously before sighing impatiently.  
话卡在喉咙里说不出来。她好奇地歪头看着我，随即不耐烦地叹了口气。

"I… just in case something happens… I, meant to tell you the last few… I've really enjoyed the last few weeks and… I love you."  
"我…以防万一发生什么…我，本想告诉你最近这几…我真的很享受过去这几周，而且…我爱你。"

She backs away and her eyes grow wide. With surprise… no it looks more like fright. I immediately curse myself for saying something like that now. Why did I have to say it before an Angel battle? She was ready to fight it, she was confident and now I've just complicated it.  
她后退一步，眼睛瞪得大大的。是惊讶…不，看起来更像是恐惧。我立刻在心里咒骂自己，为什么偏偏在这种时候说这种话。她本来准备好了要战斗，她很自信，现在我却让事情变得复杂了。

"Y-You… you love me?" "你…你爱我？"

I nod slowly, "Yeah… I-"  
我缓缓点头，“嗯…我-”

"Idiot. Telling me something like that before a fight…"  
“傻瓜。在战斗前跟我说这种事…”

A small smile creeps onto her face and she walks towards me again, she gets close to me. Her body nearly making full contact with mine and pressing me up against the wall.  
她脸上浮现出一丝微笑，再次向我走来，靠近我。她的身体几乎完全贴上了我的，将我压在墙上。

"If you get hurt… I will never forgive you Shinji."  
"如果你受伤了……我永远不会原谅你，真嗣。"

I nod slowly, "I won't… I promise."  
我缓缓点头，"我不会的……我保证。"

---

I emerge onto the Geofront, flanked on both sides by Asuka in Unit 02 and Ayanami in Unit 00. I didn't realize but thanks to what we did with the last Angel Ayanami is able to join us on this. It's three on one for this Angel which gives us a much better chance. Even though I know this, why am I so scared? Why do I feel so sick?  
我出现在地底都市，左右两侧分别是驾驶二号机的明日香和驾驶零号机的绫波。我之前没意识到，但多亏了我们上次对付使徒时绫波的表现，她现在能和我们一起出战了。这次是三对一的局面，这让我们胜算大增。尽管我知道这一点，为什么我还是如此害怕？为什么我感觉如此不适？

I look out amongst the gardens and wonder if Kaji got himself to a shelter or back into NERV somehow. I hope he did. I get no further time to think about Kaji as the ground suddenly shakes. I look up to see a chunk of the Geofront ceiling fall to the ground. Buildings hit the ground and a cloud of debris and smoke rise up. I grip the controls of the Eva tightly.  
我环视着花园，思索着加持是否设法找到了避难所，或是以某种方式回到了 NERV。希望他平安。地面突然震动，打断了我的思绪。我抬头望去，只见地表天花板的一块坠落，建筑物随之倒塌，扬起一片尘土和烟雾。我紧紧握住 Eva 的操纵杆。

_"Okay listen up, we're deploying you all in the Geofront this time, the Angel appeared out of nowhere and it's capable of smashing through our defences. You're to engage the Angel, weaken its A.T. Field and destroy the core. Exactly as we always do. Please, be careful."  
“好了，听着，这次我们要在 Geofront 部署你们所有人，天使突然出现，并且有能力突破我们的防线。你们要与天使交战，削弱它的 A.T.力场并摧毁核心。就像我们一贯的做法。请务必小心。”_

"Right." "对。"

It's more comforting to hear Misatos voice over the radio than my fathers. Her tone is always fierce and determined but there is a warmth to it that my fathers doesn't have. I suppose it comes down to a simple thing, she cares about what happens to us even if we do defeat the Angel. My father doesn't.  
在无线电中听到美里小姐的声音比听到我父亲的更令人安心。她的语气总是坚定而充满斗志，但其中蕴含着一种我父亲所没有的温暖。我想这归结为一个简单的事实，即使我们战胜了天使，她依然关心我们的安危。而我父亲则不然。

Through the cloud of smoke I finally see the Angel emerge. It's exactly the same as it was last time. Like the other Angels it's a unique looking being. This one at first appears to be all body, it's armour a patterned white and dark blue. Almost like the pattern you might see on a horse of a cow. On its sides are four orange protrusions. Two where shoulders might be and two where the hips might be.  
透过烟雾，我终于看到了天使的出现。它和上次一模一样。和其他天使一样，它是一个独一无二的存在。这个天使乍一看似乎全是身体，它的盔甲是白色和深蓝色的图案，几乎像你可能在马或牛身上看到的图案。它的两侧有四个橙色的突起，两个在肩部位置，两个在臀部位置。

Above the shoulder protrusions are two addition grey looking protrusions. These would be its shoulders. From each one is a small silverish rectangle. Aside from the energy blasts that erupt from its small face sitting astride the top of it those silver rectangles are its main weapons. They unfold and can extend acting as razor sharp weapons that can cut through most things.  
在肩部突起上方，还有两个额外的灰色突起。这些就是它的肩膀。每个肩膀上都有一个小的银色矩形。除了从它那位于顶端的小脸上爆发出的能量冲击波外，这些银色矩形是它的主要武器。它们可以展开并延伸，作为锋利的武器，能够切割大多数东西。

Finally sat in the centre of the beings body is the red sphere that acts as its core. I made a mistake the first time I thought this thing. I let my anger get the better of me, I didn't remain focuses and I attacked it relentlessly going for its face. I ignored the core and I ran out of power before I could do anything. From that moment on all power was given to the soul that really controls the Eva. That won't happen this time, Asuka is here and she is fine. Ayanami is here and she is fine too. We're going to win.  
最终，坐在生物体中央的是那颗红色球体，作为其核心。我第一次面对这东西时犯了个错误。我被愤怒冲昏了头，没有保持专注，一味地攻击它的脸部。我忽略了核心，结果在能有所作为之前就耗尽了能量。从那一刻起，所有的力量都交给了真正控制 Eva 的灵魂。这次不会重蹈覆辙，明日香在这里，她很好。绫波也在这里，她同样安然无恙。我们会赢的。

I grip the controls again and move forwards towards the weapons cabinet that has appeared. I look inside and marvel at the amount of choice I have.  
我再次紧握操纵杆，向前移动到出现的武器柜前。我往里一看，惊叹于可供选择的丰富种类。

_"This thing is strong so we've given you each a selection of ranges weapons. Standard pallet rifles are there but if you need anything more powerful we also have hand bazookas. There is also a sniper rifle in there."  
这东西很强，所以我们为你们每人准备了一系列不同射程的武器。标准弹药步枪在那里，但如果你需要更强大的武器，我们还有手持火箭筒。柜子里还有一把狙击步枪。_

_"Okay Shinji, Wondergirl this is what we're going to do. Wondergirl you go ranged with the Sniper Rifle. Me and the Third here are going to get a bit closer and use our pallet rifles too. We'll take out the A.T. Field before it even gets a chance to get close. Then I'll run in and take out the core."  
好的，真嗣，奇迹少女，我们这样安排。奇迹少女你用狙击步枪进行远程攻击。我和三号机这边会稍微靠近一些，也用我们的板条箱步枪。我们会先破掉它的 A.T.力场，不让它有机会靠近。然后我会冲进去摧毁核心。_

It's a good plan but I already know it isn't going to work. Our weapons will be ineffective against the A.T. Field, even the hand bazookas won't work. It'll come down to near our position and then it'll unfold those arms.  
计划不错，但我知道行不通。我们的武器对 A.T.力场无效，就连手持火箭筒也没用。它会逼近我们的位置，然后展开那些手臂。

Ayanami offers no resistance to Asuka's plan. I can already see her reaching for the Sniper Rifle and settling back closer to the NERV Pyramid. I grab the Pallet Rifle from the locker and aim it towards the Angel. I open a private channel to Asuka  
绫波对明日香的计划没有异议。我已看到她伸手去拿狙击步枪，退回到 NERV 金字塔附近。我从柜子里抓起板条箱步枪，瞄准了使徒。我私下给明日香开了个通讯频道。

"Asuka I-" "明日香一号-"

_"A private channel again? What is it this time Shinji? You don't have someone trapped in there this time."  
"又是私人频道？这次是什么事，真嗣？这次你没把谁困在里面吧。"_

I shrug off the sarcasm but I don't know what to say. I can't give away that I know how this Angel functions but at the same time if I don't we risk being beaten. Asuka and Rei risk being caught off guard by the arms of the Angel. I look up at the Angel again. It's arms fold down and go forwards from its face.  
我无视了她的讽刺，但不知道该说什么。我不能透露我知道这个使徒的运作方式，但同时如果我们不采取行动，就有可能被打败。明日香和绫波可能会被使徒的触手打个措手不及。我再次抬头看向使徒。它的手臂从脸部折叠下来，向前伸出。

"I... was thinking... that maybe we shouldn't face it head on. What if we-"  
"我……在想……也许我们不应该正面迎战。如果我们……"

I curse as I run out of time to finish speaking. Rei has already fired a shot at the Angel and it's accelerated its descent towards us. I raise the rifle and see Asuka do the same. We simultaneously fire controlled bursts towards the Angel and watch as all of our bullets collide with the terrifyingly strong A.T. Field.  
我咒骂着，因为时间不够而无法说完话。丽已经向使徒开了一枪，它加速向我们坠落。我举起步枪，看到明日香也做了同样的事。我们同时向使徒发射了控制好的短促连射，看着所有的子弹都撞上了那可怕的 A.T.力场。

_"Scheisse, Shinji, scrap the Pallet Rifles swap to the bazookas. Wondergirl keep up with the rifle. We won't be beaten by this bastard."  
“该死，真嗣，放弃步枪换成火箭筒。绫波，继续用步枪。我们不会被这个混蛋打败的。”_

Another deafining shot roars out from behind me as Ayanami lets off another shot from the sniper rifle. It just like the ones before collide with the A.T. Field. I look frantically at Asuka as she throws down the Pallet Rifle and picks up two of the Hand Bazookas. I drop my rifle and grab the Bazookas too just in time to see the Angel land on the ground. As soon as it touches down Asuka fires both Bazookas straight at it.  
又一声震耳欲聋的枪响从我身后传来，绫波从狙击步枪中又开了一枪。就像之前的那些一样，子弹撞上了 A.T.力场。我慌乱地看着明日香，她扔下步枪，抓起了两支手持火箭筒。我丢下步枪，也抓起了火箭筒，正好看到使徒落地。它一触地，明日香就朝它直射了两枚火箭弹。

The rockets collide with the Angel and a cloud of dust and debris is thrown into the air. I hesitate to fire my own and just watch closely waiting for the right moment.  
火箭与使徒相撞，扬起一片尘土和碎片。我犹豫着是否要发射自己的武器，只是密切观察，等待合适的时机。

_"Direct hit! You see, just needed a bit of for-"  
“直接命中！你看，只需要一点……”_

Her words are cut off as the face of the Angel emerges from the cloud of dust. I can see now that its arms have fully unfolded and it is staring directly at Asuka.  
她的话被突然打断，使徒的面孔从尘云中显现。现在我可以清楚地看到，它的双臂已经完全展开，正直直地盯着明日香。

_"-Impossible... it hasn't got a scratch on it."  
"不可能...它毫发无损。"_

I don't know which happened first, me starting to dart forward or the thin ribbon like arms of the Angel moving forward. All I know is the pain that shot through my arm when my Eva collided with Unit 02. I know the scream I sent out as pain shot through my body and I pushed myself to move as fast as I could. I know the sound of steel colliding with steel as our two Evas tumbled to the floor. I know the relief I felt as I saw the ribbons pass over us missing both me and Asuka.  
我不知道是我先冲上前去，还是使徒那细如丝带的触手先动。我只知道当我的 EVA 与 02 号机相撞时，手臂传来的剧痛。我知道我在剧痛中发出的尖叫，以及我如何拼命加速移动。我知道我们的两台 EVA 倒地时钢铁碰撞的声音。我知道当我看到那些丝带从我们上方掠过，既没碰到我也没碰到明日香时，我感到的宽慰。

"Not this time… not this time…"  
"这次不会了…这次不会了…"

_"Idiot! Get off me!" "白痴！放开我！"_

I was so distracted by my relief at preventing that from happening again I forgot we were in the middle of a fight. I roll off of Unit 02 and get up just in time to dodge one of the attacks from the Angel. I watch Asuka get to her feet and hear the thud of another rifle shot from Rei hitting the back of the Angel, this bullet like the others bounce off of the A.T. Field.  
我因为再次阻止了那件事的发生而松了一口气，以至于忘了我们还在战斗中。我从二号机上滚下来，起身及时躲开了使徒的攻击。我看着明日香站起身，听到丽再次开枪击中使徒背部的声音，这颗子弹和其他的一样，被 A.T.力场弹开了。

Without giving it anyone a chance to react I bring my Eva to its feet. I do what I did last time. I run straight towards the Angel. I react just in time to dodge one of the arms coming at me. I scream out in pain as I'm too late to dodge the other attack. It slices through the armour of my Eva and through the muscle below.  
不给任何人反应的机会，我让我的 EVA 站了起来。我做了上次做的事情。我径直向使徒冲去。我及时反应，躲开了朝我袭来的一只手臂。当我未能躲开另一只攻击时，我痛苦地尖叫起来。它切穿了我 EVA 的装甲和下面的肌肉。

I try to keep my balance but the pain is too much, I can already feel the warm sensation of blood tricking down my arm. I stumble over and my momentum is gone but out of the corner of my eye I see Asuka in Unit 02. She lets out a feral scream over the communications channel, she raises her progressive knife and dives forward with unbelievable speed.  
我试图保持平衡，但疼痛太过剧烈，已经能感觉到温热的血液顺着胳膊流淌。我踉跄着，势头已失，但从眼角余光中我看到明日香在二号机里。她通过通讯频道发出野性的尖叫，举起高振动粒子刀，以难以置信的速度向前冲去。

She clashes with the Angels A.T. Field, I can see her extending her own field desperately trying to break through it. Her voice rings out over the noise.  
她与使徒的绝对领域相撞，我能看到她拼命地扩展自己的领域试图突破。她的声音在嘈杂中响起。

_"WONDERGIRL! IDIOT! A BIT OF HELP HERE!"  
“真希波！白痴！这里需要点帮助！”_

_"Shinji, Rei, focus fire on weakening that A.T. Field."  
"真嗣，丽，集中火力削弱那个 A.T.力场。"_

The sound of her knife clashing with the A.T. Field of the Angel rings out all around me. I struggle to my feet and scramble for the Pallet Rifle. I'm just in time to dodge another attack from the arm but I land awkwardly on the Eva's shoulder. Pain shoots through me but I grit my teeth and try to aim. I choose a location just above Unit 02s left shoulder. I wait for the target to line up and fire watching as the bullets bounce off the A.T. Field. Behind me I hear the deafening thud of the sniper rifle sending another shot forward. I watch hoping, praying that it'll break through. It bounces off the field but just as it does Asuka yells out again.  
她的刀与使徒的 A.T.力场碰撞的声音在我四周回响。我挣扎着站起来，慌忙去抓取色带步枪。就在我及时躲开另一波攻击时，却笨拙地摔倒在二号机的肩膀上。疼痛贯穿全身，但我咬紧牙关，试图瞄准。我选择了一个位置，就在二号机左肩上方。我等待目标对齐，开火，看着子弹被 A.T.力场弹开。身后，狙击步枪再次发射的轰鸣声震耳欲聋。我注视着，希望着，祈祷着它能突破。子弹被力场弹开，但就在这时，明日香再次大喊。

_"IT'S WEAKENING! I CAN FEEL IT!"  
"它在减弱！我能感觉到！"_

I look forward and see she is right, she is getting closer to the Angels core. She lets out another feral scream as she continues to push towards it. I focus fire again on the Angel as it tries to lash out towards me. Instead of aiming at the A.T. Field I aim at the arm itself. I watch as most of my bullets bounce off of it but a few, a fair few make it through ripping holes in the arm.  
我向前望去，发现她确实是对的，她正逐渐接近使徒的核心。她再次发出野性的尖叫，继续向其推进。我再次集中火力攻击使徒，它试图向我反击。这次我没有瞄准 A.T.力场，而是直接瞄准了它的手臂。我看到大部分子弹被弹开，但也有不少子弹穿透过去，在手臂上撕开几个洞。

The Angel backs away from Asuka letting out its own scream. It's in pain, we're hurting it just like it tried to hurt us.  
使徒从明日香身边退开，发出自己的尖叫声。它在痛苦中，我们正在伤害它，就像它试图伤害我们一样。

_"Pilot Sohryu, be careful it is about to attack."  
“惣流驾驶员，小心，它即将发起攻击。”_

_"Huh, what do you mea-"  
"嗯？你什么意——"_

Asuka's words are cut off as she looks up just in time to see a small flash in the eye of the Angels face. Without any hesitation she dives back from the Angel just before a blast of energy is sent forward from it. It catches her square in the chest and she is sent backwards.  
明日香的话音戛然而止，她抬头恰好看到使徒脸上闪过一丝微光。她毫不犹豫地从使徒面前跳开，就在能量冲击波从使徒身上发射出来的瞬间。冲击波正中她的胸口，将她向后击飞。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

I throw the rifle down and run over to the side of Unit 02. The blast has left scorch marks on the armour and exposed sections of the flesh that lies underneath. I kneel down and open a private channel to Asuka.  
我扔下步枪，跑到二号机旁。爆炸在装甲上留下了焦痕，暴露出下面的肉体部分。我跪下来，打开与明日香的私人通讯频道。

"Asuka! Asuka!" "明日香！明日香！"

No response. 没有回应。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

_"Urgh… what… what is it, you're too loud…"  
"呃……怎么……怎么了，你太吵了……"_

She's alive, she's alright.  
她还活着，她没事。

"Asuka… you're… alive!" "明日香…你还…活着！"

_"Of course I'm alive you idiot. It's… it's just a scratch."  
"当然我还活着，你这个笨蛋。只是…只是擦伤而已。"_

I turn to see the Angel bearing down on us once more.  
我转身看到使徒再次向我们逼近。

"Asuka, stay there…" “明日香，待在那里…”

I release the knife from my shoulder compartment and release it. I reach for it and bring the Eva to full height, I scream and dive at full speed towards the waiting Angel. I feel nothing but rage and fury as I dive at it. I dodge out of the way of one of the attacks. I try to dodge the second attack from the now damaged arm of the Angel. I hear a familiar alert as I realize I wasn't completely successful. It's damaged my cable.  
我从肩部隔舱中释放出刀，将其展开。我伸手抓住它，将 Eva 完全立起，尖叫着以全速冲向等待着的天使。我心中只有无尽的愤怒与狂怒。我闪避开了其中一次攻击，试图躲避来自天使已受损手臂的第二次攻击。当我意识到并未完全成功时，听到了一个熟悉的警报声。它损坏了我的电缆。

The lightning in the Entry Plug grows red as it switches to backup power. Five minutes remaining depending on how far I push it. I don't need five minutes. I roar out.  
插入栓内的闪电变为红色，切换到备用电源。剩余时间五分钟，取决于我能推动到什么程度。我不需要五分钟。我咆哮着。

"YOU BASTARD!" "你这个混蛋！"

Diving forward I extend the knife out towards the Angels core but come into contact with its terrifying strong A.T. Field.  
我向前猛扑，将刀刃伸向天使的核心，却撞上了它那恐怖而强大的 A.T.力场。

_'Break through, break through, break through… come on! I can do this, I've done this before… please just BREAK THROUGH.'  
'突破，突破，突破……来吧！我能做到，我以前做到过……请让我突破吧。'_

I bring the knife back and send it crashing forward straight through the Angels A.T. Field. I resume diving forward and ram my shoulder hard into the Angels midsection. Pain flows through me as I realize it's my already injured shoulder.  
我将刀收回，猛地向前刺穿使徒的 A.T.力场。我继续向前俯冲，用肩膀狠狠撞击使徒的腹部。疼痛涌遍全身，我意识到这是我那早已受伤的肩膀。

I feel myself and the Angel collide on the floor and I immediately look for the core of the Angel. I don't have much time left. I've already pushed Unit 01 more than I should have done. I raise the knife and I bring it down hard on the core. An armour plate tries to envelop it and protect it from the attack but I manage to break straight through it. I don't get the core but it's exposed to me now.  
我感到自己和使徒一起摔在地上，立刻寻找使徒的核心。我剩下的时间不多了。我已经让初号机超出了应有的负荷。我举起刀，狠狠地向核心砍去。一块装甲板试图包裹住核心，保护它免受攻击，但我设法直接穿透了它。我没有击中核心，但它现在暴露在我面前。

I raise the knife again and bring it down, the sound of the steel hitting the core resonates all around me threatening to deafen me. I focus entirely on the sight of the core as the knife bounces off the solid spherical object. Undaunted I try again, the knife bounces off again. One more time, a crack begins to appear.  
我再次举起刀，猛力下劈，钢铁撞击核心的声音在我周围回响，几乎要将我震聋。我全神贯注地盯着核心，刀刃在坚硬的球体上弹开。我毫不气馁，再次尝试，刀又弹开了。再来一次，核心开始出现裂痕。

One more time, I've done it. I've saved us all! I raise the knife and prepare to bring it down for one final attack. I ready the attack, I grip the controls of the Eva tightly and then the power goes out.  
又一次，我做到了。我拯救了我们所有人！我举起刀，准备进行最后一次攻击。我准备好了攻击，紧紧握住 Eva 的控制器，然后电源突然断了。

"What? NO! NO NO NO NO NO NOT NOW! MOVE!"  
“什么？不！不不不不不，不是现在！动啊！”

I thrash the controls forward, "COME ON MOVE YOU BASTARD, MOVE MOVE MOVE! PLEASE! JUST ONE MORE!"  
我猛地将控制器向前推，“动起来，你这个混蛋，动啊动啊动啊！求你了！就这一次！”

It's no use, I can't get it to move. All I can do now is watch as the Angel discards me from my position on top of it. Unit 01 is thrown onto its back and I'm given a view of the Angel looming over me. It rotates slightly and I see its target. Unit 02 slowly getting to its feet.  
没用的，我无法让它动弹。现在我只能眼睁睁看着使徒将我从它顶端的位置抛弃。初号机被甩翻在地，我眼前是那使徒俯视的身影。它稍稍转动，我看到了它的目标。二号机正缓缓站起身来。

"Asuka… no… NO DON'T YOU DARE!"  
“明日香……不……不，你敢！”

It sends its arm forward towards Unit 02, right at the same height as its neck. I want to close my eyes but I can't. I swallow hard and realize I've failed just in time to see.  
它将手臂向前伸向二号机，正好对准了它的颈部。我想闭上眼睛却做不到。我艰难地咽了口唾沫，意识到自己失败的同时，正好目睹了那一幕。

"… No… Asuka…" "…不…明日香…"

Asuka slowly moves around and just before the Arm reaches her there is a blue blur and I realize with horror something else has happened. Asuka is saved but instead of watching the head of Unit 02 come spiralling down to the ground I instead see the head of Unit 00 come crashing down next to Unit 01.  
明日香缓缓移动，就在使徒之臂即将触及她的瞬间，一道蓝色闪光掠过，我惊恐地意识到发生了别的事情。明日香得救了，但当我本以为会看到零号机的头部旋转着坠向地面时，却惊见零号机的头部重重地摔落在初号机旁。

"Ayanami! No…" "绫波！不…"

I squeeze the controls tightly and feel all the pain throughout my body and the tears streaming down my face. Once again I scream out, "Come on! Please move! I know you can! Please let me finish this… please… mother!"  
我紧紧握住操纵杆，感受着全身的疼痛和脸上的泪水。我再次尖叫道：“来吧！请动起来！我知道你能行！请让我完成这个……求你了……妈妈！”

I look up at the Angel and see its face looking down at me. It's exposed core and the face taunting me. For a moment I almost imagine my Eva moves but it's just that, my imagination. I turn and watch as Unit 02 is now standing at full height. Asuka has the knife gripped firmly in her hand. She dives forward. I feel my Eva move again. Unit 01s hand reaches upwards and grabs the Angel by the face pulling it towards me. For a moment we're face to face, I'm looking straight into the eyes of that grotesque monster. There is a heavy thud as suddenly the Angel is swept away from me. I see the Unit 02 plunging the knife firmly into the core of the Angel and I watch and smile as I imagine Asuka inside screaming with rage and finally putting an end to this.  
我抬头望向使徒，看到它的脸正俯视着我。它暴露的核心和那张嘲弄我的脸。有那么一刻，我几乎以为我的 EVA 动了，但那只是我的想象。我转身看到 02 号机现在已完全站立起来。明日香紧握着刀，向前冲去。我感觉到我的 EVA 再次动了起来。01 号机的手向上伸去，抓住了使徒的脸，将它拉向我。我们面对面，我直视着那只丑陋怪物的眼睛。突然，一声沉重的撞击声，使徒被甩离了我。我看到 02 号机将刀深深刺入使徒的核心，我微笑着，想象着明日香在里面愤怒地尖叫，终于结束了这一切。

I watch as finally she lets go and the Angel rolls onto its back. Its body thrashing wildly as it dies. The arm of Unit 01 falls as I'm able to survey the battlefield. The dead Angel, Unit 02 with parts of its armour missing, the decapitated head of Unit 00. The once colour gardens around us are now completely stained by blood, at least those that haven't been overturned by the battle.  
我看着她终于放手，使徒翻滚着仰面朝天，身体在死亡中狂乱地抽搐。零一号机的手臂垂下，我得以审视战场。死去的使徒，零二号机装甲残缺不全，零零号机被斩首的头颅。曾经色彩斑斓的花园如今完全被鲜血浸染，至少那些未被战斗掀翻的部分。

I lie back at the thought of it all. I look again at Unit 00 and see Ayanami's battered Entry Plug on the other side of the battleground. A recovery team have already moved to open it. It's strange I should be happy, I should be ecstatic but I'm not. I nearly failed and I nearly lost Ayanami. I nearly failed and I nearly lost Asuka. It's so cold in this entry plug, I bring my knees up to my chest and sob quietly into them. I feel sick.  
我躺下，思绪万千。再次望向零零号机，看到绫波的破损驾驶舱在战场的另一侧。一支回收队伍已经上前准备开启它。奇怪的是，我本该高兴，本该欣喜若狂，但我没有。我差点失败，差点失去绫波。我差点失败，差点失去明日香。这驾驶舱里如此寒冷，我抱膝蜷缩，轻声啜泣。我感到恶心。

---

I came straight home after the battle. I pretended there was nothing wrong with my shoulder and I just ran. I didn't speak to anyone, I didn't speak to Asuka or Misato. I didn't go to the debriefing. I just put my earphones in, switched on my SDAT and I ran. We won the battle but it hurt so much, I nearly failed. I was so close to watching both Asuka and Rei die because I couldn't sort things out in advance. I knew what we were going to face and I just let it happen. If I had thought more it wouldn't have panned out that way.  
战斗结束后，我直接回了家。我假装肩膀没事，只是跑开了。我没有和任何人说话，没有和明日香或美里说话。我没有去参加汇报会。我只是戴上耳机，打开 SDAT，然后跑了起来。我们赢了战斗，但那感觉太痛苦了，我差点失败。我差点就眼睁睁看着明日香和绫波死去，因为我没能提前解决问题。我知道我们将要面对什么，我只是任由它发生。如果我多想一点，事情就不会那样发展了。

I don't even know what Reis condition is. Were they able to cut the connection and eject her before it made contact?  
我甚至不知道绫波的情况如何。他们能在接触前切断连接并弹射她出来吗？

As for Asuka, she won but how can I look her in the eyes after this? She could have been seriously hurt because of me. I'm sat on my bed listening to my music. I close my eyes for a moment until I suddenly become aware of a presence in the room. I open my eyes again and I see Asuka glaring down at me.  
至于明日香，她赢了，但我怎么能在这种情况下直视她的眼睛呢？她可能因为我而受了重伤。我坐在床上听着音乐。我闭上眼睛一会儿，直到突然感觉到房间里有个人。我再次睁开眼睛，看到明日香正瞪着我。

Taking out the earphones I look up, straight into those blue eyes of hers. "A-Asuka…"  
我摘下耳机，抬头直视她那双湛蓝的眼睛。“A-明日香……”

"Where the hell were you?"  
“你到底跑哪儿去了？”

"I-I…" “我-我……”

"You selfish…. Idiot! I was wor- They were worried about you, Misato thought something had happened."  
"你这个自私的……白痴！我……他们都很担心你，美里以为你出了什么事。"

"I… wasn't feeling great… so I came home…"  
"我……感觉不太好……所以就回家了……"

"Don't lie to me! Misato might believe that but you know fine well you can't use that bullshit on me. I saw the way you ran… why?"  
"别对我撒谎！美里可能会信，但你很清楚这种鬼话骗不了我。我看到你跑的样子了……为什么？"

I look down but as soon as I do I feel her hand on my chin. She pushed my head up until I have no choice but to look at her.  
我低头看去，但刚一动作就感到她的手放在我的下巴上。她将我的头抬起，直到我别无选择，只能直视她。

"You will not look away from me Third Child. I want an explanation, now. Why did you run?"  
“你不能避开我的目光，三子。我现在需要一个解释。你为什么要逃跑？”

I don't know what to say to her. How can I explain to her that I knew about the Angel and its capabilities? That I could have put an end to the fight sooner if I had been honest and told her about it. She wouldn't understand that, I don't understand it.  
我不知道该如何向她解释。我怎么能告诉她我知道那个使徒及其能力？如果我坦白告诉她这一切，本可以更快结束战斗。她不会理解这些，我自己也不理解。

"I… was scared…" "我……害怕了……"

"Of what?" "怕什么？"

"I saw… Ayanami get hurt and you got hurt and…"  
"我看到……绫波受伤了，你也受伤了，还有……"

I sniff loudly as the tears that were threatening begin to fall. I feel her relax her grip on my chin at the sight of the tears. I hear her sigh.  
我用力吸了吸鼻子，泪水开始滑落。看到我的眼泪，她放松了捏着我下巴的手。我听到她叹了口气。

"I thought this might happen. Here take this…"  
"我就知道可能会这样。来，拿着这个……"

She hands me a tissue and I use it to wipe away some of the tears, "Thank you… I… hesitated in the fight Asuka and… I was scared you two might have been hurt."  
她递给我一张纸巾，我用来擦掉一些泪水，“谢谢你……我……在和明日香的对决中犹豫了……我害怕你们俩会受伤。”

"So you ran away from it? You idiot! If you thought we were hurt you should have stayed."  
“所以你就逃避了？你这个傻瓜！如果你觉得我们受伤了，你应该留下来。”

"I know that but… I thought it was my fault and… I saw what happened to Ayanami and I was scared it would have been worse."  
"我知道，但是……我以为那是我的错，而且……我看到了绫波的遭遇，我害怕情况会更糟。"

"Oh you mean the head thing? She cut the connection before it hit, she's fine but she's a little bit bruised and battered."  
"哦，你是说头部那件事？她在冲击到来前切断了联系，她没事，只是有点擦伤和瘀伤。"

I allow a small smile, "I-I'm glad."  
我微微一笑，""我……我很高兴。""

"I'm fine as well by the way, thanks for asking."  
"我也很好，顺便说一句，谢谢你的关心。"

I begin to stand but she pushes me back down onto the bed, "Asuka I-"  
我正要起身，但她把我推回到床上，“明日香，我——”

"Shinji… what you said before the fight did you mean it?"  
"真嗣……你之前在战斗中说的话，是真心的吗？"

I don't hesitate in my reply, "Yes… I meant it. I love you."  
我毫不犹豫地回答，“是的…我是认真的。我爱你。”

A look comes across her face, a serious one that I've seen only a few times. "Idiot, why?"  
她的脸上浮现出一种表情，一种我仅见过几次的严肃表情。“傻瓜，为什么？”

"I-I… when I'm around you I'm happy. You're beautiful. You help me. I…"  
“我…我…和你在一起时我很快乐。你很美。你帮助我。我…”

"But I'm horrible to you, I call you mean things. I bully you. I take out my anger on you."  
"但我是如此对你不好，我叫你难听的名字。我欺负你。我把我的怒气发泄在你身上。"

"No… you… you aren't horrible to me, it's not… those things don't matter… I love you Asuka."  
"不……你……你对我并不坏，这些……这些都不重要……我爱你，明日香。"

I realize we're both standing now, I have my hands placed around her hips and her hand is drifting nervously close to my chest. She holds out her hand and places it over my rapidly beating heart. She moves closer and embraces me, her head resting against my chest. She speaks softly.  
我意识到我们都站起来了，我的双手环绕在她的腰间，而她的手紧张地靠近我的胸膛。她伸出一只手，轻轻覆盖在我急速跳动的心上。她靠得更近，拥抱着我，头靠在我的胸前。她轻声说道。

"Ich kann dein Herz fühlen."  
"我能感受到你的心跳。"

I can feel your heart, that's what she said. I don't know how I know that but when she says it I know what it means instantly. She looks up at me.  
她说她能感受到你的心跳。我不知道自己是怎么知道的，但当她说出这句话时，我立刻就明白了它的含义。她抬头看着我。

"You really love me?" "你真的爱我吗？"

I nod, "Yes." 我点头，“是的。”

She steps away from me, "You won't leave me? Or abandon me? You promise?"  
她从我身边退开，“你不会离开我？或者抛弃我？你保证？”

I shake my head, "No… I won't. I want to be with you always Asuka."  
我摇头，“不…我不会。我想永远和你在一起，明日香。”

"Good. Then I'm going to make you mine."  
"好极了。那我要让你成为我的。"

She comes towards me one more time but not before removing her shirt, she shoves me down onto the bed and forces her lips onto mine. My hands scramble around her back caressing her sides gently as she kisses me. Properly this time, no holding my nose. She breaks the kiss and starts her hands on unbuttoning my shirt. She shifts her position downwards and I softly moan as she meets more sensitive parts of my body.  
她再次朝我走来，但这次在脱掉衬衫之前，她把我推倒在床上，强行吻上了我的唇。我的手在她背上摸索，轻轻抚摸着她的两侧，她这次吻得真切，没有捏住我的鼻子。她结束了这个吻，开始解开我的衬衫扣子。她向下移动位置，当她触碰到我身体更敏感的部位时，我轻声呻吟。

I watch on as she unclips her bra leaving the top half of her body fully exposed to me. Although awkward I'm able to slip out of my shirt. Almost immediately she comes back down and kisses me again.  
我看着她解开胸罩，上半身完全展现在我面前。虽然有些笨拙，我还是设法脱掉了衬衫。她几乎立刻又俯身下来，再次吻了我。

"You're mine now Shinji. Forever."  
"你现在属于我了，真嗣。永远。"

I nod, "I'm yours Asuka. Forever."  
我点头，“我属于你，明日香。永远。”

### Chapter 16 Catalyst II
**Day 10 第 10 天**

I can feel their eyes on me as I stand before the door leading to Shinji's room. My hand tightens around the MP3 Player I've got with me. I try to not look nervous, they probably know I'm nervous but I'm not going to give them the satisfaction of knowing that. I stand up straight, I look determined and I tell myself that this is no different than piloting the Eva. I was never nervous then. It's easy. There is nothing to be nervous about.  
当我站在通往真嗣房间的门前时，我能感觉到他们的目光落在我身上。我手中的 MP3 播放器被我握得更紧了。我试图不显得紧张，他们大概知道我紧张，但我不会让他们知道这让我感到满足。我站得笔直，看起来坚定不移，我告诉自己这和驾驶 Eva 没什么不同。那时候我从不紧张。这很简单。没什么好紧张的。

Except that's a complete lie. Every time I piloted the Eva I was nervous, I was terrified but somehow I managed to develop the façade that I wasn't. The other part of it is a lie as well and I know it. This is nothing like piloting the Eva. The person I love is through that door. He is lying in a coma and unresponsive to anything. I have to help him but honestly I don't know how. I've been given advice but I can't help but wonder what if it doesn't work? What if I just go in there and nothing I do will help. What if I really am as powerless as I'm scared I am? What if everything I think about myself and my lack of purpose and ability is true, and I am really just a frightened girl without any real power to change anything.  
但那完全是谎言。每次驾驶 Eva 时我都很紧张，我害怕极了，但不知怎么的，我设法维持了一个我不害怕的假象。另一部分也是谎言，我知道。这和驾驶 Eva 完全不同。我爱的人就在那扇门后。他躺在昏迷中，对任何事情都没有反应。我必须帮助他，但老实说，我不知道该怎么做。我得到了一些建议，但我忍不住想，如果这些建议不起作用怎么办？如果我走进去，我做的任何事都无济于事怎么办？如果我真的像我害怕的那样无能为力怎么办？如果我对自己缺乏目的和能力的所有想法都是真的，而我真的只是一个害怕的女孩，没有任何真正的力量去改变任何事情怎么办？

No, that isn't true. I do have something, I will help him. I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. I'll get you back Shinji, I will help you. I can do this!  
不，那不是真的。我有办法，我会帮助他。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我会让你回来的，真嗣，我会帮你的。我能做到！

I open the door and enter the room. I can see him lying there, his chest gently rising and falling. If it wasn't for the state he was in I'd think he was cute. A little bit of stubble has formed around his chin. Fuyutsuki said that one of the nurses they have hear will shave it in a couple of days but I actually wonder if maybe he should keep it.  
我打开门走进房间。我看到他躺在那里，胸膛轻轻地起伏。如果不是因为他现在的状况，我会觉得他很可爱。他的下巴周围长出了一点胡茬。冬月说这里的护士过几天会帮他刮掉，但我其实有点好奇他是不是应该留着。

I walk over to the side of his bed and look down at him. A seat has been set up for me. On the other side of the room I can see my bed they've set up in here as well. I don't sit yet.  
我走到他的床边，低头看着他。旁边为我准备了一个座位。房间的另一边，我也能看到他们为我准备的床。我还没坐下。

"Hey Shinji… I um…" "嘿，真嗣… 我，呃…"

Why is this so difficult? I guess it's I'm conscious my words might have an effect now. Last week I just came in here and I said nothing, I just stared at him hoping he'd wake up. Now I actually have to say something and I'm conscious of wanting to say the right thing. What if the words I say do have an effect? What if he can hear me and while they don't wake him up they can shape what happens to him in his mind?  
为什么这件事这么难？我想是因为我现在意识到我的话可能会产生影响。上周我走进来，什么也没说，只是盯着他，希望他能醒来。现在我必须说些什么，并且意识到我想说正确的话。如果我说的话真的有影响怎么办？如果他能听到我，虽然这些话不能唤醒他，但它们能在他的脑海中塑造发生在他身上的事情怎么办？

I guess what scares me as well is what if they don't have any effect? I feel like so much pressure at the moment. We're the only two in this room but I feel like the entire world is watching me. This feels so stupid, I know I'm thinking too much about it. I always said that thinking too much gets us into trouble. So I just start talking.  
我害怕的另一件事是，如果它们没有任何效果怎么办？我现在感觉压力很大。虽然这个房间里只有我们两个人，但我感觉整个世界都在看着我。这感觉太蠢了，我知道我想得太多了。我总是说，想得太多会给我们带来麻烦。所以我决定开始说话。

"Hey… Shinji, I know I haven't visited you in a couple of days and I'm sorry. They… Fuyutsuki and Misato wouldn't let me. I… did something stupid last week when I was visiting you. I kinda… stopped eating and… well doing anything and Misato confronted me about it. We had a big argument at your bedside and I…"  
"嘿… 真嗣，我知道我已经有几天没来看你了，对不起。他们… 副校长和美里不让我来。我… 上周来看你的时候做了些蠢事。我有点… 不吃东西，也不做任何事，然后美里就找我谈了。我们在你床边大吵了一架，我…"

It sounds ridiculous as I say all this but I have to explain this to him.  
这些话说出来听起来很荒唐，但我必须向他解释清楚。

"Well… I threw up in the corner of your room and broke down in Misato's arms. I passed out and, well they wouldn't let me visit you. I've been staying with Misato for the past couple of days and they've been monitoring me. Making sure I eat and making sure I'm… well normal. Relatively normal anyway."  
"嗯… 我在你房间的角落吐了，然后在美里的怀里崩溃了。我晕了过去，所以他们不让我来看你。过去几天我一直和美里住在一起，他们一直在监视我。确保我吃饭，确保我… 嗯，正常。相对正常吧。"

I pause for a moment and sit down, I reach out and take his hand.  
我停顿了一下，坐了下来，伸出手握住他的手。

"So there you go, I threw up and passed out sobbing in your hospital room. I have to say when it comes to visiting each other in hospitals, we don't really have the best track record."  
“看吧，我在你的病房里吐了，哭着昏过去。不得不说，我们在医院探望彼此这方面，记录实在不怎么样。”

I wonder if I should have said that. I know how much he hates himself for what he did. I know how much I hate that it happened. I do forgive him though, I hope he does know that.  
我在想我是不是不该说那句话。我知道他有多么痛恨自己所做的事。我知道我有多么痛恨那件事发生。不过我确实原谅了他，我希望他知道这一点。

"You'd probably be mad at me for what I did. You'd probably be upset that I had been that way while visiting you. For me and Misato getting in an argument the way we did. Actually on second thought you probably wouldn't be mad would you? You'd probably just be sad instead, you'd look at us with those eyes of yours and you'd try to mask your sadness with a smile like you always do. You'd probably even apologize and make it seem like it was your fault."  
"你可能会因为我做的事而生我的气。你可能会不高兴我在拜访你的时候那样表现。因为我和美里那样争吵。实际上，再想一想，你可能不会生气，对吧？你可能会只是感到难过，你会用你那双眼睛看着我们，试图用微笑来掩饰你的悲伤，就像你总是做的那样。你甚至可能会道歉，让它看起来像是你的错。"

Smiling I grip his hand tightly, "I'm better now though, I know it's only been a couple of days but I am! I'm not going to neglect myself but I am going to help you. I'm going to be here for you, for when you wake up. I'm going to bring things to you, I'm going to look after you Shinji. I promised I'd look after you when we both returned and I'm going to keep that promise."  
我微笑着紧紧握住他的手，“我现在好多了，虽然才过了几天，但我真的感觉好多了！我不会忽视自己，但我会帮助你。我会在这里陪着你，当你醒来时。我会带东西给你，我会照顾你，真嗣。我答应过当我们都回来时会照顾你，我会遵守这个承诺。”

I look at the MP3 Player. Despite my words I haven't really thought about what I was going to say or do for him. The advice I was given said to just talk to him, or play him music that might mean something.  
我看着 MP3 播放器。尽管我说了那些话，我其实并没有真正想过要对他怎么说或做什么。我得到的建议是只要和他谈谈，或者播放一些可能有意义的音乐。

"I hope you can hear me and that my words are getting through to you in some way. The truth is I don't know what you're going through in there. When I was comatose in the hospital I saw things, horrible things Shinji. The worst moments of my life shown to me in an endless cycle. I don't just mean my mother's suicide either. I mean all the moments, me being horrible to the people who tried to care for me. Me being horrible to you. Me trying to seduce Kaji. The way I acted to Rei for fucks sake. All I could do was watch these moments over and over again and scream out that it wasn't really me. Yet at times I could hear a voice and… it belonged to you Shinji. It was you telling me to wake up and help you. To call you an idiot to…"  
"我希望你能听到我的话，希望我的话能以某种方式传达到你那里。事实上，我不知道你在里面经历了什么。当我昏迷在医院时，我看到了一些东西，可怕的东西，真嗣。我一生中最糟糕的时刻，以无尽的循环展现在我面前。我不仅仅是指我母亲的自杀。我是说所有的时刻，我对那些试图关心我的人的恶劣态度。我对你的恶劣态度。我试图引诱加持。我他妈对绫波的态度。我唯一能做的就是一遍又一遍地看着这些时刻，尖叫着说那不是真正的我。然而，有时我能听到一个声音……它属于你，真嗣。是你告诉我醒来帮助你。叫你白痴……"

I pause for a moment, "…well the point is despite all the hell I was going through I heard you. So I hope whatever is happening to you, that you can hear me. I just hope you're not going through that sort of hell. You can't be, you've already been through it and… you… no neither of us deserve that sort of hell anymore."  
我停顿了一下，"……好吧，重点是，尽管我经历了那么多地狱般的折磨，我还是听到了你的声音。所以，我希望无论你正在经历什么，你都能听到我的声音。我只希望你不要经历那样的地狱。你不可能经历，你已经经历过一次了……你……不，我们都不应该再承受那样的地狱了。"

I look across at my bed before taking the two sets of earphones out of my pocket.  
我朝我的床看了一眼，然后从口袋里拿出两副耳机。

"So… Misato and Fuyutsuki said I can't be here all the time anymore but… I'm allowed to sleep in here. I've got a bed set up so, well, hopefully when you wake up and you will wake up you'll be able to come to me straight away. If you need anything just… I'm here for you."  
"所以…美里和冬月说我不能再一直待在这里了，但是…我可以在这里睡觉。我已经准备好了床铺，嗯，希望你醒来时，你会醒来，能直接来找我。如果你需要什么，就…我在这里等你。"

I plug a headphone splitter into the socket of the MP3 player and plug in both sets of earphones. I stand up and gently put the earphones into Shinji's ears as I continue speaking.  
我将耳机分线器插入 MP3 播放器的插孔，并插上两副耳机。我站起来，轻轻地将耳机放入真嗣的耳朵里，同时继续说道。

"I wasn't really sure what to do. I could have read to you but I don't know what sort of books I could read to you. I didn't really read many stories growing up, no one ever read to me so it's not like I can share any of my favourite childhood stories with you. I had a pretty misplaced childhood, just like you. I'll find something though for tomorrow, I'll read something to you. For now though, I thought I'd play you some music. It's The Musical Box, do you remember us listening to this one?  
"我不太确定该做什么。我本可以给你读书，但我不知道该读什么书给你听。我小时候没读过多少故事，也没人给我读过书，所以我没法分享我喜欢的童年故事给你。我的童年和你一样，有些错位。不过我会找到些东西的，明天我会读点什么给你听。现在嘛，我想给你放点音乐。是《音乐盒》，你还记得我们听过这首吗？"

It was the time we were found by Rebecca and her people. We had to stay in our apartment for a couple of hours and you asked that stupid question about what a hogweed was. We ended up listening to the entire album while we lay with each other on the floor. We had been laughing with each other, cuddling each other and I had been tickling you beforehand. I never imagined the invincible Shinji Ikaris one major weakness would be being ticklish you know?  
那是我们被丽贝卡和她的人找到的时候。我们不得不在公寓里待上几个小时，你问了那个关于大猪草是什么的愚蠢问题。结果我们躺在地板上一起听完了整张专辑。我们彼此笑着，依偎着，之前我还一直在挠你痒痒。我从没想过无敌的碇真嗣会有一个如此大的弱点——怕痒，你知道吗？

Anyway… I hope you know that was one of the happiest days I've ever spent with you. It was… despite everything it just felt perfect. So I'm going to play that song to you."  
总之……我希望你知道，那是我和你共度的最快乐的日子之一。尽管有种种不如意，但那一刻感觉就是完美的。所以我要为你播放那首歌。

I find the track on the MP3 player and start to play it whilst putting my own earphones in. Immediately the first few chords play of the track. I rest my head down on Shinji's chest and close my eyes while stroking his hand.  
我在 MP3 播放器上找到那首曲目，开始播放，同时戴上自己的耳机。立刻，前几个和弦响起。我把头靠在真嗣的胸口，闭上眼睛，轻轻抚摸他的手。

_'__Play me Old King Cole_  
‘老国王科尔，与我共舞’  
_That I may join with you'  
愿我能与你同在’_

**Day 11 第 11 天**

I leave Asuka in the restaurant, she's assured me she is going to be alright. I made sure she finished her breakfast but I don't think I needed to. I think what happened on that day was a wake up call for her. It was one for me as well. I should have done a better job at seeing through the façade she put up. I should have realized that she was hurting and could have done with more support when she asked me about knowing her past in the hot spring. All I could do was offer her the advice of letting go of the past. How hypocritical of me, let go of the past? What was I doing all those months, all those years but hanging onto the past and letting it dictate my moves.  
我把明日香留在餐厅，她向我保证她会没事的。我确保她吃完了早餐，但我觉得没必要。我想那天发生的事对她来说是个警醒。对我也是。我本应该更好地看穿她所设的假象。我本应该意识到她在痛苦中，当她在温泉里问我了解她的过去时，她需要更多的支持。我所能做的只是给她放下过去的建议。我多么虚伪，放下过去？这几个月，这些年，我一直在做什么，不就是紧紧抓住过去，让它决定我的行动吗？

Yet I can never let go of the past completely and nor should I, nor should Asuka or Shinji. In fact none of us in this place should let go of it. We should embrace it and if need be confront it but we should also keep it where it is, in the past and strive to move forward.  
然而，我永远无法彻底放下过去，我也不应该，明日香或真嗣也不应该。事实上，我们这里的任何人都不能放下它。我们应该拥抱它，必要时面对它，但我们也应该让它留在过去，努力向前迈进。

We've all been given a second chance, or maybe this is my third or fourth chance. I've lost count of the chances I've had and wasted. My father sacrificed his life for me on the day of Second Impact, have I used that time effectively? I spent two of my teenage years practically comatose. I spent my college years in a relationship that I ran away from. I spent most of my adult years plotting revenge against those that took away my father. I escaped death a number of times during this, in fact I did die. Yet here I am now and I'm not going to waste this chance.  
我们都得到了第二次机会，或者这可能是我的第三次或第四次机会。我已经记不清自己有过多少次机会并浪费了。在第二次冲击那天，我的父亲为我牺牲了生命，我是否有效地利用了那段时间？我几乎昏迷了两个青少年时期。我在大学期间逃避了一段关系。我大部分成年时间都在策划对那些夺走我父亲的人进行复仇。在此期间，我多次逃脱死亡，事实上，我确实死过。然而现在我在这里，我不会浪费这次机会。

Exiting the elevator I round the corner into the medical bay. Fuyutsuki is sat at his desk waiting for me. I don't know why he has called me here, I can only assume that it is something to do with Shinji. When I enter he looks up at me.  
走出电梯，我拐进医疗区。Fuyutsuki 坐在他的桌子旁等我。我不知道他为什么叫我来这里，我只能假设这与真嗣有关。当我进去时，他抬头看着我。

"Katsuragi I'm glad you could come."  
"葛城，很高兴你能来。"

I give a small smile and nod. It's a polite greeting but we both know that it isn't like I had anything else to do, my activity in this shelter is limited. We still know little of the people who attacked us, after the two we caught died we've heard nothing else and the teams sent out have found nothing either. Besides, when it comes to Shinji or Asuka I'm always going to be there now, no matter what.  
我微微一笑，点头致意。这是礼貌的问候，但我们心知肚明，我并没有其他事情可做，在这个避难所里我的活动范围有限。我们对袭击我们的人知之甚少，抓到的两人死后，我们再无任何消息，派出去的队伍也一无所获。此外，无论是对真嗣还是明日香，我现在总是会在那里，无论发生什么。

I take a seat on the other side of his desk, "Is this about Shinji?"  
我在他办公桌的另一边坐下，"是关于真嗣的事吗？"

He nods and hands me a sheet of paper, "Yes, it's nothing to worry about, in fact it might be good news. Take a look at the readings on this sheet of paper. These were taken a few days ago."  
他点点头，递给我一张纸，“是的，没什么好担心的，实际上可能是好消息。看看这张纸上的读数。这些是几天前测的。”

I scan through the various figures and charts on the sheet. None of it makes any sense to me but most of the graphs seem to be stable. I can only assume this is a good thing.  
我扫过纸上的各种数字和图表。这些对我来说毫无意义，但大多数图表似乎都很稳定。我只能假设这是好事。

"They look... fine?" “看起来...还好？”

He nods and pulls out another sheet passing it over to me, "Indeed. Everything is stable, brain activity, heart rate, breathing, all as we would expect. Now take a look at this."  
他点点头，又抽出一张纸递给我，“确实。一切都很稳定，脑活动、心率、呼吸，都如我们所料。现在看看这个。”

I look down the list and my mouth goes dry as I see the difference in the charts. The stability I saw in the previous charts is no longer present, instead replaced by high peaks amongst a number of them. I try to stop my hand from trembling as I hand it back to him.  
我顺着列表看下去，看到图表上的差异，嘴巴不由得发干。之前图表中的稳定性已不复存在，取而代之的是一系列的高峰。我努力控制住颤抖的手，将纸递还给他。

"W-What is this?" “这、这是什么？”

He looks at me, "On this day this occurred for a short period of time, maybe about half an hour or so. For some reason Shinji's brain activity picked up, along with this his heart-rate also increased along with his adrenaline levels."  
他看着我，“在这一天，这种情况发生了一小段时间，大约半小时左右。由于某种原因，真嗣的大脑活动突然增强，同时他的心率也随之上升，肾上腺素水平也提高了。”

"I-Is that bad?" “我——这是坏事吗？”

"No, in fact it's good. It shows that Shinji's brain is still active. Of course there has always been some activity there but this is more definitive. His body is working and reacting to some form of stimuli."  
“不，实际上这是好事。这表明真嗣的大脑仍然活跃。当然，那里一直有一些活动，但这次更为明确。他的身体正在工作，并对某种刺激做出反应。”

"So... he's dreaming?" “所以... 他在做梦？”

Fuyutsuki nods, "I expect so, of course we have no way of knowing. We have not developed a technology that allows one to dive into another persons mind but it is hope that something is happening inside him. He is fighting it."  
“冬月点头，“我想是的，当然我们无法确定。我们还没有开发出一种技术，可以让一个人潜入另一个人的心灵，但我们希望他内心正在发生些什么。他在与之抗争。”

I smile proudly, Shinji is fighting it, just as he always does.  
“我自豪地微笑，真嗣正在与之抗争，就像他一贯所做的那样。”

---

For some reason I feel more nervous about doing this today than I did yesterday. It's stupid, I'm stupid for feeling nervous. I'm just talking to him aren't I? I'm just going to talk to him, hold his hand and play him some music. Yet I'm nervous because I still don't know if it'll work or if my words will reach him.  
不知为何，今天做这件事我感觉比昨天更紧张。真是愚蠢，我因为紧张而感到愚蠢。我只是和他聊天，不是吗？我只是要和他聊聊，握住他的手，给他放些音乐。然而我还是紧张，因为我仍然不确定这样做是否有效，或者我的话能否传达到他心里。

I step into the room again, I'm trying to show the same confidence I did yesterday but as soon as I enter I breathe out and allow my shoulders to hang. I allow the sadness to come across my face and I allow myself to be me. The person under the mask. It isn't easy.  
我再次踏入房间，试图展现出和昨天一样的自信，但一进门我就呼出一口气，让肩膀下垂。我让悲伤浮现在脸上，允许自己展现出真实的我，那个隐藏在面具下的人。这并不容易。

"Hey idiot, it's me again."  
“嘿，傻瓜，又是我。”

I watch for a reaction on the monitors at me calling him an idiot. I thought maybe that would do something rather than me calling him Shinji all the time. Of course nothing happens, it was worth a try. It's funny how I call him that sometimes, I know he is far from an idiot but it has somehow turned around into a term of endearment for him. He likes me to call him it, I suppose its proof of who I am to him. I've seen couples in love in the past, it's funny how some will attach meaning to certain words others wouldn't. How they develop pet names for each other. I guess idiot is my pet-name for him.  
我在监控器上观察他对我称他为白痴的反应。我想这或许比总是叫他真嗣要有效果。当然，什么也没发生，但值得一试。有趣的是，我有时会这样称呼他，我知道他绝非白痴，但这不知怎的变成了对他的昵称。他喜欢我这么叫他，我想这是证明我在他心中地位的一种方式。我见过那些相爱的情侣，有趣的是，他们会赋予某些词特殊的意义，而这些词对其他人来说可能毫无意义。他们会给对方起昵称。我想，白痴就是我对他的昵称。

I wonder if he has one for me, he's never called me anything except for Asuka. Even when I met him he called me Asuka. Usually he'd have called me Sohryu as he had never met me, isn't that the tradition here? He opted straight for Asuka though.  
我想知道他有没有给我起昵称，他从未叫过我除明日香以外的名字。即使初次见面时，他也直接叫我明日香。通常情况下，他应该叫我惣流，这不是这里的传统吗？但他直接选择了明日香。

I know of course what his friends call me. Or at least one name amongst the many that they call me. They'd never call me any of those names to my face of course, they're frightened of me. I quite like that, I enjoy having power over people. That's why I'm always on top when me and Shinji make love. I don't like to give that power away. Although when Shinji does wake up I'm going to give him a special treat.  
我当然知道他的朋友们怎么称呼我。或者说，至少是他们众多称呼中的一个。他们当然不敢当着我的面用那些名字叫我，他们怕我。我挺喜欢这种感觉，享受着对人的掌控力。这就是为什么我和真嗣做爱时我总是主导的那一方。我不喜欢放弃这种权力。不过，等真嗣醒来时，我会给他一个特别的惊喜。

Gripping the MP3 Player tightly in my hand I try to force any thoughts of mine and Shinji's activities out of my head. I can't think about that sort of thing while he is in this state. It'll just frustrate and annoy me. I could do something about it but when I tried that last week it just left me feeling empty.  
我紧紧握住手中的 MP3 播放器，试图将我和真嗣的那些事从脑海中赶走。在他这种状态下，我不能想那些事情。那只会让我感到沮丧和恼火。我可以做些什么来解决，但上周尝试过后，只让我感到空虚。

I shift towards the seat and sit down. I've been thinking about what I can say to him tonight. Should I tell him about what has been happening outside? Tell him about how my day has been? Maybe something about my past? I already know what song I'm playing him tonight at least, that was easy.  
我挪向座位并坐下。我一直在思考今晚该对他说些什么。我应该告诉他外面发生的事情吗？还是谈谈我今天过得如何？或者聊聊我的过去？至少今晚我要给他放的歌已经选好了，这倒不难。

"Misato says hello. She'll be visiting you during the day tomorrow. She would have done so today but she had to leave the shelter for something. I don't know what, they don't really tell me anything but I'd rather it be that way. I don't need them… all I need is you, that's all we need Shinji… each other…"  
Misato 向你问好。她明天白天会来看你。本来今天就要来的，但她得离开避难所处理些事情。我不清楚是什么事，他们也不怎么告诉我，但我宁愿这样。我不需要他们……我只需要你，我们只需要彼此，这就是我们需要的，真嗣……彼此……

As soon as the words leave my mouth I realize they're incorrect, they aren't my words but the words of the other Asuka. The possessive one, the one who told Shinji that if she can't have him all to herself she didn't want him at all. She's been nagging at me the past few days. Trying to force me to regress. I'm trying to suppress her, when I was around Shinji it was so easy to do so. By just holding me she'd melt away and wouldn't bother me.  
话一出口，我就意识到它们不对劲，这些不是我的话，而是另一个 Asuka 的话。那个占有欲强的 Asuka，她曾告诉真嗣，如果不能完全拥有他，她宁愿不要他。最近几天她一直在烦我，试图逼我退步。我努力压制她，当我在真嗣身边时，这很容易做到。只要他抱着我，她就会消失，不再打扰我。

Now that he is in this state it's harder. I let her take over last week, I let her tell me how useless I was for caring about anyone. I let her tell me I had just been let down and betrayed and that I was pathetic. I nearly let her beat me. If I hadn't tried to goad Misato into a fight, then maybe I wouldn't be able to beat it back.  
现在他处于这种状态，事情变得更难了。上周我让她占据了上风，她告诉我关心别人是多么无用。她告诉我，我只是一再被辜负和背叛，我是多么可悲。我差点让她打败我。如果不是我试图激怒 Misato 打一架，也许我就无法反击了。

"…Listen to me, I don't need anyone, we don't need anyone. What a load of crap. Maybe… maybe for a time we didn't need anyone. We survived for six weeks on our own Shinji. We actually did it and we didn't kill each other, we could probably survive on our own for longer but… I like having people back. I like having that life around me. Hey… would you like to know a secret? I've never told anyone this before…"  
"…听我说，我不需要任何人，我们不需要任何人。真是胡说八道。也许…也许有一段时间我们确实不需要任何人。我们自己生存了六周，真嗣。我们真的做到了，而且我们没有互相残杀，我们可能还能独自生存更久，但是…我喜欢有人陪伴。我喜欢那种生活围绕着我的感觉。嘿…你想知道一个秘密吗？我以前从没告诉过任何人…"

I swallow before continuing. About to reveal my secret shame, the one major fear of Asuka Langley Sohryu.  
我咽了咽口水，准备继续。即将揭露我那羞于启齿的秘密，赤木律子·明日香·兰格雷最大的恐惧。

"I'm afraid of the dark Shinji. It terrifies me. You remember when we had to fight that Angel when all the power went down? It was me, you and Wondergirl and we were up on that hill afterwards watching the lights come back on. I was so scared that night of the dark. I was so happy that I was with you and Ayanami. I wouldn't have admitted it but I was. You kept what lurked out there at bay. Then the lights came back on and I was so relieved."  
"我害怕黑暗，真嗣。它让我恐惧。你还记得我们不得不对抗那个天使的时候，所有的电力都中断了吗？当时是我、你和绫波丽，我们在那之后站在山上看着灯光重新亮起。那天晚上我对黑暗感到非常害怕。我很高兴有你和绫波丽在身边。我不会承认的，但我确实如此。你让外面的那些东西无法靠近。然后灯光重新亮起，我感到非常宽慰。"

For some reason it feels like a big relief to get something like this off my chest. My shameful secret. Somehow when I say it out loud it doesn't seem as shameful at least not when I tell Shinji. It's not because he can't hear me or respond because I know I'd feel the same if he could. He wouldn't laugh at me, he wouldn't judge me. He'd probably tell me what he was scared of to make me feel better.  
出于某种原因，将这样的心事倾吐出来，感觉像是卸下了重担。我那羞于启齿的秘密。不知为何，当我说出口时，至少在告诉真嗣时，它似乎不再那么羞耻了。并非因为他听不见或无法回应，我知道即便他能听见，我的感受也会是一样的。他不会嘲笑我，也不会评判我。他可能会告诉我他害怕什么，以此让我感觉好些。

"You know why I'm scared of the dark don't you? It was dark in the room when I found my mother. The corridor was dark as well. I don't know why, I was four years old so I didn't stop to ask about the power situation. So I ran in this dark corridor towards her room. I was so happy and excited, they had picked me as an Eva pilot. I entered the room and there she was… just a body hanging from the ceiling.  
你知道我为什么怕黑吗？那晚我在黑暗中找到了母亲。走廊也是漆黑一片。我不知道为什么，那时我才四岁，没去考虑电力问题。所以我在这黑暗的走廊里向她的房间跑去。我既高兴又兴奋，他们选我当了 EVA 驾驶员。我走进房间，她就在那里……只是一具悬挂在天花板上的尸体。

So now I'm scared of the dark, I'm scared that I'll see that sort of thing again in the dark. That it'll get me without any warning. In the light I can be prepared for it though, I can defend myself or run away. In the dark I can't."  
所以现在我怕黑，我害怕在黑暗中再次看到那样的景象。它会在没有任何预警的情况下袭击我。在光亮中，我可以有所准备，可以自卫或逃跑。但在黑暗中，我做不到。

I sigh, "I'm scared of dolls as well, although you already knew that didn't you. Not too fond of clowns either actually. That isn't because of anything traumatic in my past, I just don't like them. So… don't take me to a circus when you wake up."  
我叹了口气，“我也害怕玩偶，虽然你已经知道这一点了，不是吗？实际上，我也不太喜欢小丑。这并不是因为我过去有什么创伤，我只是单纯不喜欢它们。所以……当你醒来时，别带我去马戏团。”

I allow myself to laugh, "You know yesterday I told you about the things I did last week? I had some dark thoughts during that week Shinji. I nearly let the old Asuka take over again. The one who rejected everyone around her, the one who lashes out when she wants to be held. The one who was so horrible to you. I can feel her there inside me, I guess… I have to accept she is a part of me. I wonder, do you have that? During the time we were back did you ever have the urge to let the old Shinji take over, to regress to that state because you thought it'd be easier on you?"  
我让自己笑出声来，“你知道昨天我跟你说了上周我做的事情吗？那一周我有些阴暗的想法，真嗣。我差点让过去的明日香再次占据上风。那个拒绝身边所有人，想要被拥抱时却会发怒，对你那么恶劣的明日香。我能感觉到她在我内心深处，我想……我必须接受她是我的一个部分。我在想，你有过那种感觉吗？在我们回来的时候，你是否曾有过让过去的真嗣接管的冲动，退回到那种状态，因为你觉得那样会更容易？”

I reach out for his hand and take it, gently intertwining my fingers with his.  
我伸出手去握住他的手，温柔地将自己的手指与他交缠在一起。

"You probably don't want to hear all my problems though, so what has gone right for me? Well I had time to play some games today. I managed to get past that boss we were having problems with. Of course it was easy when I figured it out, just stay behind him during most of the right, keep an eye on when he's going to swipe all around himself so you dodge away and he also has a charge attack. It was that one that kept on throwing us off. I managed to get the timing down and beat him. I recorded it too so you can watch it when you get back.  
“你可能不想听我那些烦心事，那我有什么好事呢？今天我抽空玩了会儿游戏。终于打败了那个让我们头疼的 Boss。当然，一旦摸清门道就简单了，大部分时间只要跟在他背后，留意他何时会挥舞四周以便闪避，他还有个冲锋攻击，之前总是让我们措手不及。我掌握了时机，成功击败了他。我还录了下来，等你回来可以看看。”

Imagine if we had to fight the Angels like that? Holding up a shield while staying in its blind spot for god knows how long chipping away at its health?"  
“想象一下，如果我们要像那样对抗使徒？举着盾牌，在它的盲点里待上老天才知道多久，一点点削减它的生命值？”

I look across at him, he's looking peaceful again and I wonder if he is dreaming. If so then what is he dreaming about? I rest my head down on his should and under the thin sheet I move my hand so it is across his chest. Along the way I pause and I whisper.  
我转头看向他，他又恢复了平静，不知道是不是在做梦。如果是的话，他在梦什么呢？我把头靠在他的肩上，在薄薄的被单下，我的手移到了他的胸前。途中我停顿了一下，轻声细语。

"Ich kann dein Herz fühlen."  
"我能感受到你的心跳。"

I smile at the cheesy line and I hold my hand in place, "You know what that means Shinji? It means 'I can feel your heart', it feels… strong, but it's also comforting. It always has been, you know sometimes when I fall asleep on top of you I like to just listen to it as I go to sleep. It relaxes me."  
我对这句俗套的话微笑着，手依旧放在原处，“你知道这意味着什么吗，真嗣？这意味着‘我能感受到你的心’，它感觉……坚强，但又令人安心。它一直如此，你知道吗，有时候我趴在你身上睡着时，我喜欢听着它入睡。它让我放松。”

I lift myself up from my position and bring out the MP3 player and connect the earphones up just as I did yesterday.  
我从原来的位置起身，拿出 MP3 播放器，像昨天那样连接上耳机。

"Anyway, I think it's time for your song today. I don't know if you heard this one yet. It's called Untouchable, Part One. I picked it because… well you'll hear that I guess."  
“总之，我想今天该给你听这首歌了。我不知道你有没有听过。它叫做《不可触碰，第一部分》。我选它是因为……嗯，你听下去就会明白了。”

I find the song on the MP3 player and press player. Immediately the sounds of guitars fill my ears. I lie back down again, resting my head on his should and wrapping my arm around him. I close my eyes and let the song play.  
我在 MP3 播放器上找到那首歌，按下播放键。立刻，吉他的旋律充盈我的耳际。我再次躺下，头枕在他的肩上，手臂环绕着他。我闭上眼睛，任由歌曲流淌。

_'And I feel, like I knew you before  
“我感觉，仿佛早已认识你”_  
_And I guess, that you can hear my through this song.  
我想，你定能通过这首歌听见我。_

_And my love will never die  
我的爱永不会消逝_  
_And my feelings will always shine.'  
我的情感将永远闪耀。_

**Day 12 第 12 天**

I look across at Fuyutsuki as he hands me the sheets from yesterday. A concerned look is on his face and suddenly all my good feelings about Shinji fighting it dissipate. I look at the sheet, with its graphs and readings and it's similar to the one from the other day. I compare it to the previous one. Trying to see what might be causing him concern. The graphs aren't identical as is to be expected but there is one anomaly amongst it all.  
我望向冬月，他递给我昨天的报告。他脸上带着忧虑的表情，突然间我对真嗣战斗的所有好感都消失了。我看着那张布满图表和读数的纸，它与前几天的那份相似。我将其与之前的对比，试图找出令他担忧的原因。图表并不完全相同，这是预料之中的，但其中有一个异常之处。

In the first sheet he shown me there was a reading for blood pattern. It's a standard part of the equipment here, I don't really know what it means but the graph from before was static. This time there is a small spike in the graph.  
在他第一次给我看的报告中，有一项血液模式的读数。这是这里的标准设备之一，我并不真正了解它的含义，但之前的图表是静态的。这次图表上出现了一个小峰值。

"What is this?" “这是什么？”

He takes the sheets back from me, "That is Shinjis blood pattern, at its base we have a reading of orange. At the top we have blood pattern blue. For a fraction of a second yesterday Shinji shown a reading of blood pattern blue."  
他从我手中拿回床单，“这是真嗣的血型图案，底部我们读取到的是橙色。顶部则是蓝色血型图案。昨天真嗣有一瞬间显示出了蓝色血型图案。”

I grow cold at his words. I know exactly what that means but it can't be true. It must be a mistake with the equipment. Perhaps it's faulty in some way.  
他的话让我感到一阵寒意。我完全明白这意味着什么，但这不可能。一定是设备出了问题。或许是哪里出了故障。

"I-It can't be true, is the equipment fine? It might be faulty! All the interference from Third Impact and it hadn't been used."  
“这-这不可能，设备正常吗？会不会是故障了！第三次冲击带来的所有干扰，而且它还没被使用过。”

He nods grimly, "As far as I am aware it's all working fine but I have asked for it to be looked over just in case. This reading was only for a fraction of a second, it could be nothing but…"  
他严肃地点头，“据我所知一切正常，但我还是要求检查一下以防万一。这次读取只持续了极短的时间，可能什么都不是，但是……”

"It… must mean nothing, Shinji can't be… it can't be an…"  
“它……应该没什么意义，真嗣不可能……这不可能是……”

I can barely bring myself to say the word. I look across the desk and Fuyutsuki is clearly struggling with this as well.  
我几乎无法说出那个词。我望向桌子对面，副校长显然也在为此挣扎。

"There can't be anymore Angels… can there?"  
"不能再有天使了……是吗？"

### Chapter 17 Weaving A Story II
**Day 12 第 12 天**

When I wake up I'm immediately conscious of a weight on top of me. I glance downwards and I see her sleeping form clinging to me. Her arms around my side, he head resting on my chest right over where my heart is. For a brief hazy moment the room feels different, like I'm back in that apartment and it's the morning of the first time we made love. I blink and the haziness goes away, I'm not in that place. I'm in my room. In my bed where last night we made love. This isn't an apartment in an abandoned town. This is an apartment belonging to Misato. This is my home.  
当我醒来时，立刻感觉到身上压着什么。我低头一看，是她熟睡的身影紧贴着我。她的手臂环绕在我身侧，头靠在我的胸口，正好压在我的心脏上方。有那么一瞬间，房间感觉不同了，仿佛回到了那个公寓，那是我们第一次做爱的早晨。我眨了眨眼，朦胧感消失了，我不在那个地方。我在我的房间，我的床上，昨晚我们在这里做爱。这不是废弃小镇里的公寓，这是属于美里小姐的公寓。这是我的家。

I gently lean up taking care to not disturb Asuka and I realize something. This is Misato's apartment, Misato will be here... now, and she'll probably be in the other room. She might even come in to wake me up. I look across to my small dressing table. I can see the remnants from last night. I need to get rid of this quickly, Misato already knows sometimes Asuka spends the night in here. She caught her once but she thinks I sleep on the floor. She allows it probably because she knows about Asuka's past, and Asuka's fear of the dark.  
我轻轻地坐起身，小心翼翼不吵醒明日香，然后意识到一件事。这是美里小姐的公寓，美里小姐现在会在...这里，她可能会在另一个房间。她甚至可能会进来叫醒我。我望向我的小梳妆台，可以看到昨晚留下的痕迹。我需要尽快清理掉这些，美里小姐已经知道有时明日香会在这里过夜。她曾撞见过一次，但她以为我睡在地板上。她允许这样做，可能是因为她了解明日香的过去，以及她对黑暗的恐惧。

I blink again and think about that for a moment. Asuka is afraid of the dark? I... don't remember her telling me that but now that I think about it, it feels like something I've always known. Did she tell me that when I was in that other place? I don't remember but then again I can't remember every little thing that we spoke about there. No, I don't think she told me but it makes sense. She hinted at it when the power was out in Tokyo 3, she seemed relieved when the power came back on. She always needs holding at the night and has those nightmares. I think it just makes sense.  
我再次眨眼，对此思考了一会儿。明日香怕黑吗？我……不记得她告诉过我，但现在想来，这感觉像是早已知晓的事情。她在我身处那个地方时告诉过我吗？我不记得了，但我也无法记住我们在那里谈及的每一件小事。不，我想她没告诉过我，但这说得通。东京 3 区停电时她曾暗示过，电力恢复时她显得松了一口气。她总是需要在夜晚被拥抱，经常做噩梦。我觉得这很合理。

I look down, again. Asuka looks so peaceful. I'm hesitant to wake her up this early but if I don't then Misato might catch us. I don't know how Misato would react to something like this. She's always teasing us about being a couple, she's always making jokes and mock advances but those are jokes. This is real, if she found out we were a couple she'd probably like it but to find out we were having sex. That might be another issue.  
我再次低头看去。明日香看起来如此安详。我不太想这么早叫醒她，但如果我不这么做，美里可能会发现我们。我不知道美里对此会有何反应。她总是拿我们开玩笑，说我们是情侣，总是开玩笑和模仿追求，但那些都是玩笑。这是真的，如果她发现我们是情侣，她可能会喜欢，但如果发现我们在做爱，那可能是另一个问题。

I shift away from Asuka, trying to get out of the bed without waking her up. As I move I feel her arm tightening around me. She presses her head into me more and I hear her stirring.  
我轻轻挪开明日香，试图在不惊醒她的情况下下床。我移动时感觉到她的手臂紧紧抱住我。她将头更深地埋进我怀里，我听到她在动。

"Idiot, just where do you think you're escaping to? Stay here, you're warm."  
"傻瓜，你以为你能逃到哪儿去？留在这儿，你很暖和。"

I'd love to stay here with her, I want nothing more than that but I can't. I listen out for any movement from outside my door. I glance quickly at my alarm clock, the alarm hasn't gone off yet. There is still about ten minutes so the chances are she isn't awake yet. I can get up, dispose of this and we'll be alright.  
我多想留在这里陪她，没有比这更让我渴望的了，但我不能。我留意着门外是否有动静。我迅速瞥了一眼闹钟，闹铃还没响。还有大约十分钟，她很可能还没醒。我可以起床，处理掉这个，我们就没事了。

"Asuka... I... I, Misato is... we... need to..."  
"明日香...我...我，美里她...我们...需要..."

Asuka raises her head finally, looks at the discarded wrapper and items on the table. Her eyes widen ever so slightly but she quickly drops her head back onto my chest.  
明日香终于抬起头，目光落在桌上的废弃包装和物品上。她的眼睛微微睁大，但很快又将头靠回我的胸口。

"Oh! Don't worry about it, Misato stayed out last night. Looks like your words might have had an effect on Kaji. He took her out straight after the battle, it looked serious actually."  
“哦！别担心，美里昨晚出去了。看来你的话可能对加持起了作用。他战斗一结束就带她出去了，看起来真的很认真。”

"R-Really?" “真-真的吗？”

She nods, "Yup, so thanks to that we probably won't have to worry about Misato until later on today. So stay exactly where you are and let me rest for just a little bit longer. I'm feeling a little bit sleepier than usual for some reason."  
她点点头，“嗯，所以多亏了这一点，我们今天可能暂时不用担心美里了。你就待在原地别动，让我再休息一会儿。不知为什么，我今天感觉比平时更困。”

Trusting her that Misato isn't in yet I allow myself to calm down and close my eyes. I wrap my arms around her naked body and enjoying lying there, even if it is for another ten minutes.  
相信她说的美里还没来，我让自己放松下来，闭上眼睛。我环抱着她赤裸的身体，享受着躺在那里的时光，哪怕只是再多十分钟。

"What do you mean you forgot to make our lunches?"  
“你忘了给我们做午餐是什么意思？”

"I'm sorry… I…" "对不起……我……"

I look down at the desk avoiding her and everyone's gaze as she berates me.  
我低头看着桌子，避开她的目光以及所有人的注视，任由她训斥我。

"I didn't have time last night…"  
"昨晚我没时间……"

"You didn't have time? And why is that idiot?"  
"你没时间吗？还有，那个白痴是怎么回事？"

I finally look up not knowing what to say. She knows why I didn't have time, she can't have forgotten can she? No, that isn't it. Yet I can't help but feel hurt, I thought she might be different to me in front of the others because we grew closer. Yet she is just the same and now she is blaming me for something beyond my control, and I can't even defend myself.  
我终于抬起头，不知道该说什么。她知道我为什么没时间，她不可能忘记了吧？不，不是这样的。然而，我不禁感到受伤，我以为在我们变得更亲近后，她在别人面前对我会不一样。然而她依旧如故，现在她把无法控制的事情归咎于我，我甚至无法为自己辩解。

She catches my eye and immediately realizes why I didn't have the time to make our lunches. I can see the look of horror spread across her face, I can see the apologetic look in her eyes but Asuka won't apologize to me. Not in front of the class.  
她捕捉到我的目光，立刻意识到我为什么没时间准备我们的午餐。我看到她脸上惊恐的表情，看到她眼中抱歉的神色，但明日香不会在全班面前向我道歉。

"So… I'm supposed to have that bland excuse for food they serve in the cafeteria am I Third Child? Just… make sure it doesn't happen again…"  
"所以…我应该吃食堂里那种索然无味的饭菜，是吗，第三适格者？只是…确保不要再发生这种事了…"

"Oh, it's another fight for the newlyweds!"  
"哦，新婚夫妇又吵架了！"

I instantly go red at the sound of his voice and Asuka does too. We have even more reason to go red today considering what we did last night. Obviously the few people in our class don't and won't know about that. Least of all the returning Touji. In perfect unison we turn around to him and yell.  
听到他的声音，我立刻脸红了，明日香也一样。考虑到昨晚我们做的事，今天我们更有理由脸红。显然，我们班上的几个人并不知道，也不会知道。尤其是刚回来的冬二。我们异口同声地转过身去，对他大喊。

"SHUT UP!" “闭嘴！”

He offers nothing but a laugh in our direction. I sigh and turn around to face the board again. Asuka has moved away to her seat and is typing something on her laptop. A moment later a message appears on my screen.  
他只是朝我们笑了笑。我叹了口气，再次转身面对黑板。明日香已经回到她的座位，正在笔记本电脑上打字。片刻后，我的屏幕上出现了一条消息。

_'Sorry.' “对不起。”_

I tap out a message back to her, _"It doesn't matter."_  
我给她回了一条消息，“这无关紧要。”

_'Don't be an idiot, of course it matters. I know why you couldn't make them, but Hikari asked me why I didn't have lunch today so I just… I couldn't tell her that could I?'  
“别犯傻了，当然重要。我知道你为什么没能来，但光问我今天为什么没吃午饭，所以我只是……我不能告诉她，对吧？”_

_"I guess not… I thought you had forgotten."  
“我想不能……我还以为你忘了呢。”_

_'IDIOT! What sort of person do you think I am?'  
'白痴！你以为我是什么样的人？'_

_"Sorry…" "对不起…"_

_'Oh just… You make apologizing to you so difficult!'  
'哦，只是……你让我向你道歉变得这么难！'_

_"Sorry…" "对不起…"_

There is a loud bang as I realize Asuka has slammed her laptop shut in anger. I turn and she shoots me a glare that could kill me. Thankfully our teacher enters at that moment before this can escalate.  
意识到明日香愤怒地猛然合上笔记本电脑时，发出了一声巨响。我转过头，她投来一个足以置我于死地的瞪视。幸好此时老师进来了，才避免了事态进一步升级。

I didn't expect to be entering NERV again today but Misato called the two of us up at lunch time summoning us in. There was only silence on the journey into the Geofront as we looked over the destruction from yesterday. Where the Angel blasted through the ceiling of the Geofront is a hole showing the outside world. Laying at the bottom of the Geofront was an array of buildings from above, ruined gardens and bloodstains from the Eva's and the Angel. That was the power of this particular Angel, likely to be the strongest we face.  
我没想到今天会再次进入 NERV，但美里在午餐时间打电话给我们俩，召我们过去。在前往地底空洞的途中，我们默默地看着昨日的破坏景象。天使击穿地底空洞天花板的地方，露出了外面的世界。地底空洞底部散落着来自地面的建筑残骸、毁坏的花园和 EVA 与天使留下的血迹。这就是这个特定天使的力量，很可能是我们将面对的最强敌人。

I wonder how us beating the Angel the way we did will alter things. Evangelion Unit 01 didn't go berserk in this fight. It didn't absorb an S2 engine and didn't achieve a four hundred percent sync ratio. I'm not trapped inside there for thirty days. Asuka didn't get beaten like last time, her confidence has increased.  
我在想，我们以这种方式击败天使会对事情产生怎样的影响。初号机在这场战斗中没有暴走，没有吸收 S2 引擎，也没有达到四百同步率。我没有被困在里面三十天。明日香没有像上次那样被打败，她的信心增强了。

Yet as we beat the Angel and move forward I'm already scared of what comes next. This last one was the last traditional fight we'll have. The next one attacks us from orbit, there is no weapon that can reach it aside from the Lance of Longinus stored in Terminal Dogma. It's how this one attacks us that terrifies me. I look across at Asuka, she's smiling and I know she is happy but I know what is inside her. I know what this Angel can bring to the surface. I can't let her be attacked.  
然而，在我们击败使徒并继续前进时，我已经对接下来发生的事情感到恐惧。这最后一个使徒是我们传统战斗中的最后一场。下一个使徒将从轨道上攻击我们，除了存放在最终教条区的朗基努斯之枪外，没有任何武器能够触及它。正是这种攻击方式让我感到恐惧。我环顾四周，看到明日香在微笑，我知道她很高兴，但我也知道她内心隐藏着什么。我知道这个使徒能激发出什么。我不能让她受到攻击。

My mind wanders to what Misato might want. It was Asuka who spoke to her and not me. Instantly I'm worrying if maybe she knows about what we did last night. Maybe she went back to the apartment found the condom in the garbage. No, that can't be it. There is no way she could know, we were both very careful to dispose of everything and make sure she wouldn't find it.  
我的思绪飘向了美里可能想要什么。是明日香和她交谈，而不是我。我立刻担心她是否知道我们昨晚的事情。也许她回到公寓，发现了垃圾桶里的避孕套。不，那不可能。她不可能知道，我们都非常小心地处理了一切，确保她不会发现。

"We're here." “我们到了。”

The train comes to a halt and the doors open. I follow her out and within moments we're in NERV's main headquarters. We enter the main reception area and Misato is already there to greet us.  
列车停了下来，车门打开。我跟着她下车，转眼间我们就来到了 NERV 的主要总部。我们进入主接待区，美里已经在那里迎接我们。

"Sorry to call you in like this but we have a new arrival coming. The Fifth Child has been found and will be arriving later this afternoon."  
"很抱歉这样突然叫你来，但我们有一个新成员即将到来。第五个孩子已经被找到了，今天下午晚些时候就会到达。"

Asuka's face drops instantly, the smile she wore previously suddenly replaced by anger. I say nothing, I can't say anything. My mouth grows dry instantly and the heavy feeling of dread in my stomach I've been carrying around so much returns. The Fifth Child will be arriving, it has to be him. Yet this isn't supposed to happen yet.  
明日香的脸色立刻沉了下来，她之前带着的笑容突然被愤怒所取代。我什么也没说，我什么也说不出来。我的嘴巴立刻变得干燥，那种一直缠绕在我胃里的沉重恐惧感又回来了。第五个孩子即将到来，一定是他。但这不应该这么快发生。

"A Fifth Child? Found? Is this a joke?"  
"第五个孩子？找到了？这是在开玩笑吗？"

Despite the smile on Misato's face I can tell she isn't happy with the news of the Fifth Child. I know why. There was no news that they were looking for a Fifth Child, they were all informed this morning by the mysterious Marduk Institute. An organization that doesn't really exist. It's just a cover for NERV and SEELE. Misato already knows this by now but as far as she knew it was only the people in my class who were supposed to be candidates.  
尽管美里脸上挂着微笑，我能看出她对第五适格者的消息并不高兴。我知道原因。之前没有任何消息表明他们在寻找第五适格者，所有人都是今早被神秘的马杜克机构通知的。这个机构其实并不存在，只是 NERV 和 SEELE 的幌子。美里现在应该已经知道这一点了，但据她所知，只有我们班的人才是候选者。

She knows there is someone else pulling the strings and she knows it was they who sent Kaworu. She's suspicious but I can't say anything. Even though I know Kaworu is really an Angel, I can't tell her that. They'll think I'm insane.  
她知道有人在幕后操纵，也知道是他们派来了薰。她心存疑虑，但我什么也不能说。尽管我知道薰实际上是一个天使，我不能告诉她。他们会认为我疯了。

"I'm afraid not and believe me I'm as surprised as you are. Yet that is the way of things, he will arrive shortly. His Eva will be arriving later this week. I trust you both to make him feel welcome here."  
“恐怕是的，相信我，我和你一样惊讶。但事情就是这样，他很快就会到达。他的 EVA 将在本周晚些时候抵达。我相信你们俩会让他在这里感到受欢迎。”

"Whatever." “随便。”

I ask the question. I already know the answer but I need confirmation.  
我问出了那个问题。我其实已经知道答案，但需要确认。

"Mi-Misato… what's his name?"  
“美-美里……他叫什么名字？”

My stomach tightens as soon as the words leave her mouth, "Kaworu Nagisa."  
她一说出“渚薰”，我的胃就紧缩了起来。

---

It's been a couple of hours since Misato told us the news of the Fifth Childs arrival. Asuka decided she had better things to do and went shopping with Hikari. She said that she deserved some rest after saving the city from the Angel yesterday. I on the other hand have decided to go to one of the newly formed lakes in Tokyo-3.  
距离美里告诉我们第五适格者到来的消息已经过去几个小时了。明日香决定她有更重要的事情要做，于是和光一起去购物了。她说昨天从使徒手中拯救了城市，她应该休息一下。而我则决定去东京-3 新形成的一个湖泊看看。

Formed by us and our war against the Angels. The water in the lake is red, tinged with the blood of the Eva's and Angels. In that other place this lake ended up getting bigger and bigger until it joined completely with the waterfront and the sea. Was it here that we awoke after the Third Impact? It feels familiar. I turn my head and imagine the backpacks we had with our supplies in. The few blankets we had. Asuka sitting up and watching over me making sure I wasn't ill.  
这个湖泊是由我们与使徒的战争形成的。湖水呈红色，掺杂着 EVA 和使徒的血液。在另一个地方，这个湖泊不断扩大，最终完全与海岸和海洋相连。我们是在这里从第三次冲击中苏醒的吗？感觉很熟悉。我转过头，想象着我们背着的装有补给的背包，我们仅有的几条毯子。明日香坐起来，守望着我，确保我没有生病。

All that, those weeks we spent together and the time leading up to it was all an illusion. Conjured by an Angel. Yet I can still remember a lot of it so vividly, it felt so real to me. I look out across the water. I blink and fear grips me as I see something, no someone standing on the lake. Staring straight at me. The water around her darkens.  
所有那些，我们一起度过的那些星期以及之前的时光，都是一场幻觉。由一个使徒制造出来的。然而我仍然能清晰地记得很多细节，对我来说感觉如此真实。我望向水面。眨眼间，恐惧攫住了我，因为我看到有东西，不，有个人站在湖上。直直地盯着我。她周围的水变暗了。

I step back in fright, and exclaim. "A-Ayanami?"  
我惊恐地后退，失声叫道：“绫波？”

I blink again and she is gone, the darkened water returned to normal. I take a few deep breathes to calm myself down. It was… it wasn't the first time I've seen Ayanami's form like that. This place is weird like that. I saw her before I even knew her but this time… it was so much like that day after the Third Impact.  
我再次眨眼，她已消失，黑暗的水面恢复如常。我深呼吸几次以平复心情。这……并非我第一次见到绫波那般模样。这个地方就是如此诡异。在我认识她之前就见过她，但这次……太像第三次冲击后的那天了。

I regain my composure and look out again across the silent lake. It's peaceful and suddenly a humming fills the air. A song that I recognize. Slowly I turn my head and look upwards. There he is, exactly as I remember him. Perched on that rock. His white hair swaying gently in the breeze, his red eyes and that smile. He's dressed like I am except he has an orange t-shirt on underneath his school shirt. I swallow as he turns his eyes towards me.  
我恢复镇定，再次望向寂静的湖面。一切如此宁静，突然间空气中充满了哼唱声。那是我熟悉的旋律。我缓缓转头，抬头望去。他就在那里，和我记忆中一模一样。坐在那块岩石上。白发在微风中轻轻摇曳，红眸和那抹微笑。他穿着和我相似的校服，只是里面多了一件橙色 T 恤。当他将目光转向我时，我咽了咽口水。

"You know the song?" "你知道这首歌吗？"

I nod slowly, "It's the Ode to Joy."  
我缓缓点头，“这是《欢乐颂》。”

"I like this song, I think singing is one of the crowning achievements of Lilin Civilisation, don't you agree?"  
"我喜欢这首歌，我认为歌唱是莉莉丝文明最辉煌的成就之一，你不这么认为吗？"

Much like I did that other time I don't know how to respond to him. I know what he is but at the same time I long to be friends with him. I wonder if maybe we can be friends this time around. Maybe he doesn't have to do what he did in that other place. Maybe we can avert it. I don't want to lose him again, I can't lose him.  
就像上次那样，我不知道该如何回应他。我知道他的本质，但同时我又渴望与他成为朋友。我在想，也许这次我们可以成为朋友。也许他不必再做那个地方发生的事。也许我们可以避免它。我不想再次失去他，我不能失去他。

"You look like you have much on your mind."  
“你看起来心事重重。”

He climbs down from where he is seats and walks towards me. Just like last time he stands close to me.  
他从座位上下来，走向我。就像上次一样，他站得离我很近。

"I… I was just wondering what you meant by Lilin…"  
"我…我只是想知道你说的‘莉莉丝’是什么意思…"

He steps back and I can't tell if he is surprised by my question. He had used that word in the other place and I stupidly never picked up on it. I was so desperate for love and friendship and he offered it. Everyone else was suspicious of him but not me, it was just like Asuka always tells me. I was an idiot. Yet I don't think Kaworu was malicious in what he did. I don't think he told me anything false. That's why I think I can change that here. I think I can stop him but I just don't know how.  
他后退了一步，我无法判断他是否对我的问题感到惊讶。他曾在另一个地方使用过这个词，而我愚蠢地从未留意。我如此渴望爱与友谊，而他提供了这些。其他人对他都心存疑虑，唯独我没有，正如明日香常说的那样。我是个傻瓜。然而，我不认为渚薰所做的是出于恶意。我不认为他告诉我的有任何虚假。正因为如此，我认为我可以在这里改变这一切。我想我能阻止他，只是不知道该怎么做。

He speaks again, "I could answer but I'm sure you're already aware of what I mean. Shinji Ikari."  
他再次开口，"我可以回答，但我确信你已经明白我的意思了。碇真嗣。"

"Y-You know who I am?"  
"你-你知道我是谁吗？"

"Of course I know who you are. The Third Child, you are unaware of your own fame. You and of course the Second Child and First Child Asuka Langley Sohryu and Rei Ayanami. I am the Fifth Child Kaworu Nagisa. Although again, I suspect you already knew that."  
"我当然知道你是谁。第三适格者，你对自己的名声一无所知。你，当然还有第二适格者和第一适格者惣流·明日香·兰格雷和绫波零。我是第五适格者渚薰。虽然，我猜你已经知道这些了。"

All I can do is nod. There is something to his words that frighten me. He's implying that I already knew these things but I couldn't have done could I? Unless he…  
我只能点头。他的话中有种让我害怕的东西。他暗示我已经知道这些，但我怎么可能知道呢？除非他……

"Unless of course Miss Katsuragi failed to mention my arrival…"  
"除非当然，桂木小姐忘了提及我的到来……"

"N-No… she mentioned it."  
"不……她提到了。"

"Good. I am afraid however that I must go to NERV. I believe they will want to give me my card and accommodation details."  
"很好。不过，恐怕我得去 NERV 一趟。我想他们会给我门卡和住宿信息的。"

"O-Oh… I c-I can come with you if you want? Do you know where to go?"  
"哦-哦… 我-我可以跟你一起去，如果你愿意的话？你知道去哪儿吗？"

He waves his hand, "Oh it's no problem. I'm acquainted quite well with NERV already. Besides you have people waiting for you."  
他挥了挥手，"哦，没问题的。我对 NERV 已经相当熟悉了。再说，你还有人等着呢。"

He nods towards a point some distance away. I can see a car parked, next to it are two figures that I can make out as being Misato and Asuka. That's strange, I thought Asuka was going out with Hikari this afternoon.  
他朝远处的一个点点了点头。我可以看到一辆车停在那里，旁边有两个身影，我能认出是美里和明日香。真奇怪，我以为明日香今天下午要和光出去的。

"You should go and see them. I believe we will see each other again soon, Shinji Ikari."  
"你应该去看看他们。我相信我们很快会再见面的，碇真嗣。"

"Y-Yeah… we will." "嗯……会的。"

I turn and see him smiling at me, the same smile he's been wearing all throughout this meeting. I'm lost in what to say so I just nod. I begin to walk towards the car and back to Asuka and Misato.  
我转身看到他对我微笑，这个微笑从会议开始就一直挂在他的脸上。我不知道该说什么，只好点点头。我开始走向汽车，回到明日香和美里身边。

---

"So getting a look at the competition were you Shinji?"  
"所以，想看看竞争对手是谁吗，真嗣？"

Asuka turns around as she says it and smiles at me. There is no malice in her voice like there might have been at one time. She seems relaxed actually. I know the idea of there being another pilot bugs her but she isn't letting it show right now.  
明日香转过身来，笑着对我说。她的语气中没有像以前那样的恶意。她看起来真的很放松。我知道有另一个驾驶员这件事让她感到困扰，但她现在并没有表现出来。

"He was just introducing himself. I didn't expect to see him there."  
"他只是在自我介绍。我没想到会在那里见到他。"

Deep down I know that isn't entirely true. I was expecting him to be there because that's where he was the other time I met him.  
我内心深处明白那并不完全正确。我期待他在那里，是因为上次我遇见他时他就在那儿。

"Yeah, they were slow getting his papers sorted back at NERV so he had a bit of time to explore the Geofront I guess. Of course it was to be expected, we didn't expect to get another pilot so suddenly."  
“是啊，他们在 NERV 那边处理他的文件花了些时间，所以他大概有空探索一下 Geofront。当然，这是可以预料的，我们没想到会这么突然地再得到一名驾驶员。”

"Marduk Institute goes from taking years to locate a child to finding two in two weeks."  
“Marduk Institute 从花费数年寻找一个孩子，到两周内找到两个。”

Misato falls silent at Asuka's statement as do I. Asuka doesn't know about Marduk, that it really doesn't exist. She doesn't know the real reason as to why we're the only ones who can pilot. Or at least, why I, she and Touji could pilot. I still don't know about Ayanami or Kaworu.  
听到明日香的话，美里陷入了沉默，我也一样。明日香不知道马尔杜克的事，它实际上并不存在。她不知道为什么只有我们能驾驶 EVA，或者说，为什么我、她和冬二能驾驶。关于绫波和薰，我仍然一无所知。

"Hey kids, I'm going to be visiting Kaji again tonight. I'll probably be back late."  
“嘿，孩子们，今晚我要再去见加持。可能会很晚回来。”

"What? You're leaving us alone again! Further to the point you're leaving me alone with him! Who knows what he'll try to do!"  
“什么？你又要丢下我们不管了！更别提你这是让我和他单独相处！谁知道他会打什么主意！”

"I would have thought you'd both like to be alone, given how well you're both getting on recently."  
"我本以为你们俩最近相处得这么好，会想单独待一会儿呢。"

Asuka snorts, "Yeah right. It saves us from your cooking at least. I'll find something to do."  
明日香嗤之以鼻，"“说得对。至少这让我们不用吃你做的饭。我会找点事情做的。”

"There is always your homework and studying. I know school hasn't been high on the priority list lately but I am still keeping track of your grades and you're both in need of improvement."  
"还有你的作业和学习。我知道最近学校的事没那么重要，但我还是在关注你们的成绩，你们俩都需要提高。"

"Studying? Wh-Why? I've already been through college! I've saved this city… twice in two weeks! They should just be giving us a free pass. If anything it's Shinji who needs improvement…"  
"学习？为——为什么？我大学都毕业了！我救过这座城市……两周内两次！他们应该直接给我们免考。要说需要提高的，反倒是真嗣……"

"Is that so? Then explain why his grades are better than yours at the moment."  
"是吗？那为什么他现在的成绩比你好呢？"

I say absolutely nothing, knowing better than to get involved. Instead I listen to their arguing back and forth. I'm sure I can make out how I'm an idiot and got lucky in the last tests we did. Or perhaps how she would have done better if she didn't have to focus her efforts on learning the Kanji or helping me.  
我一言不发，深知不要卷入其中为妙。我只是听着他们一来一往的争吵。我确信我能听出他们说我是个白痴，上次考试只是侥幸。或者也许是她本可以做得更好，如果不是因为她不得不专注于学习汉字或帮助我的话。

I feel a small vibration in my pocket and look down at the message from Asuka.  
我感觉口袋里传来轻微的震动，低头一看是来自明日香的信息。

_'I have something much more fun in mind than studying. ;)'  
'我想到比学习更有趣的事情了。;)'_

I can feel my cheeks burn and I'm aware of her eyes watching me in the reflection of the mirror as I put the phone away. My mind flashes back to the previous night. I think about how good it felt to be with Asuka in that way. I think about how it felt for us to give ourselves to each other in that way and wake up together and I begin to feel familiar stirrings in parts of me. I suddenly change the subject and try to think of something other than Asuka and her body.  
我能感觉到脸颊发烫，当我收起手机时，通过镜子反射注意到她的目光正盯着我。我的思绪闪回到昨晚。我想起和明日香那样在一起的感觉有多好。我想起我们彼此交付对方、醒来时的感觉，某些部位开始有了熟悉的悸动。我突然转换话题，试图不去想明日香和她那曼妙的身躯。

"We saw Kaji yesterday! Before the battle, is he alright?"  
"我们昨天见到加持了！战前，他没事吧？"

Misato nods, "Yeah, he got to a shelter before the Angel broke through. He's… well he's going back to Germany for a bit."  
美里点头，"嗯，天使突破防线前他及时躲进了避难所。他……嗯，他要回德国一阵子。"

"What! Kaji is leaving?" "什么！加持要走了？"

"Only for a short while, he's got some personal matters to deal with there. So… that's why I'm seeing him tonight. He's taking me out for dinner."  
“只是短暂离开，他那边有些私事要处理。所以……今晚我要见他。他带我去吃晚饭。”

"Hah, two adults trying to rekindle a college romance. How sweet…"  
“哈哈，两个成年人试图重燃大学时期的浪漫。真甜蜜……”

It's Misato's turn to blush, "It's not like that! We have a lot of work details to go through and well… we… oh shut up! Besides at least we don't skip around it like you and Shinji do! Going out on dates and pretending it was nothing. Holding hands on walks through the GeoFront… we all know Asuka. Even the bridge bunnies have a bet on for when you make it official."  
轮到美里脸红了，“不是那样的！我们有很多工作细节要讨论，而且……我们……哦，闭嘴吧！至少我们不像你和真嗣那样绕圈子！出去约会还假装没什么。在 GeoFront 散步时牵手……我们都知道明日香。就连那些桥上的工作人员都下注赌你们什么时候正式公开。”

"Y-You! It… What… you're all irresponsible!"  
"你！这…怎么…你们都太不负责任了！"

"Hah! So it is true then?"  
"哈！这么说，那传闻是真的了？"

"Shut up!" "闭嘴！"

Once again I don't say anything, I just sit back and actually enjoy hearing them tease each other like that. For a moment I forget about what is to come and I actually relax. I'm with people I love and we're happy.  
我又一次保持沉默，只是坐下来，真正享受他们像那样互相调侃的时光。有那么一刻，我忘记了即将到来的事情，我真正放松了下来。我和我爱的人在一起，我们很快乐。

**Day 13 第 13 天**

"It has wings?" “它有翅膀？”

Asuka looks up at the white Evangelion Unit in front of us. Kaworu's Evangelion, Unit 05. She looks to be in awe of its form. It is after all quite different from the other Evangelion Units. It's humanoid up until the face. The face itself is more grotesque, if that were possible for an Evangelion. Its form elongated and with no visible eyes. Its mouth formed into a permanent grin and bright red colouring for the lips. On the back are of course its wings. Currently folded down.  
明日香抬头望着我们面前的白色 EVA 初号机。那是渚薰的 EVA，05 号机。她看起来对它的形态感到惊叹。毕竟，它与其他 EVA 初号机确实大相径庭。它的外形在脸部之前都是人形，而脸部本身则更为怪异，如果这可能的话。它的形态被拉长，没有明显的眼睛，嘴巴则形成了一个永久的笑容，嘴唇是鲜艳的红色。在背部，当然，是它的翅膀，目前是折叠着的。

I of course recognize it for another reason. This is the first in the Eva series, a group of mass produced Evangelions. All fitted with an S2 engine, all made to run with the dummy plug. These were the Units that Asuka had to fight on that day, the day I abandoned the world and did nothing.  
我当然出于另一个原因认出了它。这是 Eva 系列中的第一台，一群大规模生产的 Evangelions。所有都配备了 S2 引擎，所有都设计为与模拟插入栓一起运行。这些正是那天明日香不得不与之战斗的机体，那一天我抛弃了世界，什么也没做。

I reach out and grab her hand and squeeze it. She squeezes back.  
我伸出手抓住她的手，紧紧握住。她也回握了我。

"It's… different to the others…"  
“它……与其他的不同……”

"Hah, so it has wings and an S2 engine. It'd still be no match for my Unit 02, I'd take it out no problem. In fact you could put me up against nine of those things, I'd give it three and a half minutes until I've beaten them all."  
"哈哈，有翅膀和 S2 引擎又怎样。我的二号机照样能轻松搞定，没问题的。实际上，就算让我对付九台那样的东西，我也能在三分钟半内把它们全干掉。"

My mouth goes dry at hearing her say that. That's how many there were on that day. That's how much time she had. I always wondered, if it hadn't been for that lance, or if she had destroyed the cores would she have beaten them? Of course that was a different Asuka, from an illusion. It wasn't this one. Yet the images are so vivid. That was the trigger wasn't it. The death of the person I loved. I drop my head and weakly reply.  
听到她这么说，我口干舌燥。那天就是那样，她只有那么点时间。我一直在想，如果不是那把长枪，或者她摧毁了核心，她能赢吗？当然，那是一个不同的明日香，来自一个幻象。不是眼前这个。但那些画面太鲜明了。那就是导火索，对吧？我爱的人的死亡。我低下头，无力地回应。

"Y-Yeah…" "嗯……嗯……"

"What? You don't believe me?"  
"什么？你不相信我？"

"N-No I do. I just… you wouldn't have to fight them… alone I mean. I'd be there with you."  
"不，不，我相信你。我只是……你不必独自面对他们……我的意思是，我会和你一起。"

"As long as you don't get in the way."  
"只要你别碍事。"

"I wouldn't." "我不会的。"

"Good." "很好。"

We fall silent and look up at the imposing Eva together.  
我们陷入沉默，一同抬头仰望那威严的 Eva。

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"You're not going to… you wouldn't leave me alone would you?"  
"你不会……不会丢下我一个人吧？"

I shake my head, "No, of course I wouldn't. What I said the other night… I'm yours, forever Asuka. I love you."  
我摇摇头，“不，当然不会。那天晚上我说的话……我是你的，永远都是，明日香。我爱你。”

"Good." "很好。"

She releases me hand and steps in front of me looking me in the eyes. She takes both my hands this time.  
她松开我的手，走到我面前，直视我的眼睛。这次她握住了我的双手。

"Then I have no problem doing this then."  
“那么，这样做我就没有问题了。”

I'm taken by surprise as she reaches her hand around to the back of my head and draws me close to her. I barely have time to react as her lips press against mine. I put my arms around her and embrace her, I don't know how long our kiss lasts for but she eventually pulls away and smiles.  
她突然伸手绕到我脑后，将我拉近她。我几乎来不及反应，她的唇就贴上了我的。我伸出双臂拥抱着她，不知这个吻持续了多久，但她最终还是退开，微笑着。

"No more skipping around it in public, no more hiding it from others. No more pretending Shinji. This is us now… forever."  
“不再在公众场合回避，不再向他人隐瞒。不再假装了，真嗣。这就是我们现在的样子……永远。”

I nod and repeat the word, "Forever."  
我点头重复这个词，“永远。”

---

There is still a little bit of time before the sync test so I've decided to come to the hospital wing. I'm going to visit Rei. I've not had the opportunity to speak to Rei since the last fight, in fact since we spoke that one time after school. When she asked me about my father, about my love for Asuka and about family.  
同步测试还有一点时间，所以我决定来医疗翼。我要去看望丽。自从上次战斗后，我其实就没有机会和丽说话，确切地说，自从那次放学后她问我关于我父亲、我对明日香的感情以及家庭的事情之后，我们就没再谈过了。

I should have visited sooner but I'm still scared of talking to Rei. Knowing what she is and what she is capable of doing and why she exists. That frightens me but I have to stop being afraid. I can't keep running away.  
我本该早点来探望的，但我还是害怕和丽交谈。知道她的身份、她能做什么以及她为何存在，这些都让我害怕，但我必须停止恐惧。我不能再逃避了。

I knock on the door and enter slowly, "Ayanami?"  
我敲了敲门，慢慢走进去，“绫波？”

"Yes?" "是的？"

I walk into the hospital room. All of these rooms look the same but for some reason Ayanami's seems even sadder than usual. When I've had to stay here there has usually been a vase of flowers or a few cards left for me from friends. Rei doesn't have anything. Suddenly I wish I had brought something else than what I had done. I should have brought a card or some flowers.  
我走进医院病房。这些房间看起来都大同小异，但不知为何，绫波的房间似乎比平常更加凄凉。我曾在这里住过几次，通常会有朋友送来的花瓶或几张卡片。丽没有任何这些东西。突然间，我希望自己带了别的东西，我应该带张卡片或一些花的。

Her eyes follow me as I enter the room and move to her bedside. Her expression doesn't change, is she happy to see me?  
她目不转睛地看着我走进房间，走到她的床边。她的表情没有变化，她见到我高兴吗？

"I… thought I'd come and visit you, and see how you were doing."  
“我……想着来看看你，看看你怎么样了。”

Her eyes flicker slightly and there is a slight shift in her expression. Just enough for me to notice. Rei's emotions, her expressions are subtle. She isn't like Asuka where you can see a change in mood. You have to look carefully, you have to know her.  
她的目光微微闪烁，表情有了一丝变化。刚好让我察觉到。丽的心情，她的表情总是那么微妙。她不像明日香那样，情绪变化一目了然。你需要仔细观察，你需要了解她。

"I… am doing well. I will be able to go home soon."  
“我……还好。很快就能回家了。”

I smile reassuringly, "I'm glad to hear it."  
我安慰地笑了笑，“很高兴听到这个消息。”

Reaching into my bag I pull out a small flask, "I… I brought you this. I know the food in this place isn't great and… well I know you don't eat meat and they serve it with every meal so I made you some soup… it… it isn't much I know but I thought you might like it…"  
我伸手从包里掏出一个小酒瓶，“我……我给你带了这个。我知道这里的食物不太好，而且……嗯，我知道你不吃肉，但他们每顿饭都提供肉，所以我给你做了些汤……我知道这不算什么，但我想你可能会喜欢……”

She looks up at me and her eyes flicker again, a small red blush appears on her cheeks as she stutters out her gratitude, "I… t-thank you…"  
她抬头看着我，眼神再次闪烁，脸颊上泛起淡淡的红晕，结结巴巴地表达她的感激，“我……谢、谢谢你……”

"Would you like some?" “你想来点吗？”

"I would like that…" “我很愿意…”

I pour some of the hot soup into the flasks cup and hand it to her, "Be careful it's probably still hot."  
我将一些热汤倒入水壶的杯子里，递给她，“小心点，可能还很烫。”

She nods and holds it in her hands for a moment before lifting the cup up to her face. She sniffs at it for a moment before taking a gentle sip. She doesn't seem to be bothered by the heat. Her eyes light up even more after taking another sip.  
她点点头，双手捧着杯子片刻，然后举到脸前。她先嗅了嗅，然后轻轻抿了一口。似乎并不介意热度。再喝一口后，她的眼睛更加亮了起来。

"This is… really nice. Thank you Ikari."  
“这真是……非常棒。谢谢你，碇。”

It's funny but I've never associated myself with feeling pride before. Yet hearing her compliment me like that, I feel the pride inside me rise up. Misato and Asuka always complimented my cooking and, well I know they meant it but I was always forced to do it for them. It was either that or we risk whatever Misato could do. I always felt the thank you afterwards was an obligation. I know that isn't true, Asuka complimented me many times since and genuinely meant it. Yet this was different.  
说来好笑，我以前从未觉得自己会因骄傲而动容。但听到她那样夸赞我，内心的自豪感油然而生。美里和明日香总是夸奖我的厨艺，嗯，我知道她们是真心的，但那总是迫于无奈。要么做饭，要么就得承担美里可能带来的风险。我总觉得之后的感谢是一种义务。我知道那并不真实，明日香后来也多次真诚地夸奖过我。但这次不同。

I sit down and look on as she continues to gently sip from the soup. I'm trying to think of something to say.  
我坐下来，看着她继续轻啜汤羹。我正努力想着该说些什么。

"So… have you had any other visitors?"  
"那么…你还有其他访客吗？"

"Yes… the Commander came to visit me earlier."  
"是的…指挥官之前来看过我。"

"My father… was here?" "我父亲…来过这里？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Did he say anything?" “他说了什么吗？”

"He told me there is an activation test set for today and that the Fifth Child has arrived. Is that correct?"  
“他告诉我今天有一个激活测试，而且第五个孩子已经到了。是这样吗？”

"Y-Yeah… he arrived yesterday. His name is Kaworu Nagisa… he's, they sent over an Eva just for him. It's white and has wings…"  
“嗯……他昨天到的。他叫渚薰……他们为他专门送来了一台 Eva。是白色的，还有翅膀……”

She mumbles something, I can just make the words out, "One of the Eva Series…"  
她咕哝着什么，我勉强能听清，“是 Eva 系列中的一架…”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"It is nothing… what is the status of the Second Child?"  
“没什么…二号适格者的情况如何？”

"Asuka? She is… she is fine…"  
“明日香？她…她还好…”

A smile creeps onto my face, "Oh… we… well you won't know yet but we… made things official."  
一丝微笑爬上我的脸庞，“哦……我们……嗯，你还没听说，但我们……已经正式确立关系了。”

She eyes me curiously, "Official?"  
她好奇地看着我，“正式？”

I nod my head. 我点了点头。

"Yeah… we're… a couple now. We… well I guess people saw us but we're not hiding it anymore."  
“是啊……我们现在……是情侣了。我们……嗯，我想人们已经看到了，我们不再隐藏了。”

"I see, in which case I believe Aoba, Hyuga and Maya owe me 1,000 yen each. That is quite agreeable."  
“我明白了，这样的话，我想青叶、日向和真嗣每人欠我 1000 日元。这倒是挺不错的。”

I'm a little bit confused by her words and then I think back on what Misato said to me and Asuka yesterday about them having a bet on us. Did Rei…  
我对她的话有些困惑，然后我想起了昨天美里对我们说的关于他们打赌的事。难道丽……

"Rei… did you put a bet on me and Asuka?"  
"丽…你是不是在我和明日香身上下了注？"

"Yes." "是的。"

I can't be mad at Rei. The technicans maybe for gambling on myself and Asuka but Rei, I can't be mad at that because it's so funny. I'm actually laughing at how ridiculous it is, the idea of Rei not only gambling and betting on something like that but actually winning. The person who is supposed to be cold and emotionless according to everyone else actually managed to win a bet on when me and Asuka would become a couple.  
我没法对丽生气。那些技术人员或许因为在我和明日香身上赌博而该被责怪，但丽，我无法对她生气，因为这太滑稽了。我实际上在笑这件事有多荒谬，丽不仅参与了赌博，还押注于这种事情上，并且真的赢了。按照其他人的说法，本应冷漠无情的她，竟然成功押中了我和明日香何时会成为一对。

"They asked if I would like to place a wager expecting me to not accept or to get it wrong. I was however able to place an educated guess on when such an announcement would occur based on how close the two of you have grown recently and the fact that there was an Angel attack recently. I felt that the two of you would likely make the announcement sooner rather than later. I believe the others expected it to happen at the earliest another two weeks from now."  
"他们问我是否愿意下注，以为我会拒绝或猜错。然而，我基于你们俩最近关系的密切程度以及最近有使徒攻击的事实，做出了一个有根据的猜测，认为你们很可能会尽早宣布。我觉得其他人预计最早也要再过两周才会发生这种情况。"

"I… see, congratulations."  
"我…明白了，恭喜。"

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

"Ikari…" "碇…"

"Yes." "是的。"

"I hope the two of you will be very happy together."  
"希望你们俩能非常幸福地在一起。"

"T-Thank you." "谢-谢谢你。"

The synchronisation tests went exactly as expected. Asuka came out on top as always with me close behind. Kaworu was third by a couple of points. Rei is still in the hospital after the accident so wasn't a part of the tests today. Kaworu's performance did of course raise some eyebrows from people. They were amazed at how high his score was so early on. I imagine Misato, Akagi and my father will already suspect what Kaworu is. The others will just see it that he is a natural or it was a fluke.  
同步测试的结果完全符合预期。一如既往，明日香名列前茅，我紧随其后。渚薰以几分之差位居第三。由于事故，绫波零仍在医院，因此今天没有参加测试。渚薰的表现自然引起了一些人的注意。他们对他如此早期的成绩感到惊讶。我想，美里、赤木律子和我的父亲可能已经怀疑渚薰的身份了。其他人只会认为他是天生的或者只是侥幸。

Kaworu and Asuka met for the first time today. They didn't say much to each other, Asuka shook his hand and warned him to ensure he didn't get in his way when the next Angel attacked. Kaworu smiled and told her that he has no intention of hindering her.  
今天，渚薰和明日香首次见面。他们没有太多交流，明日香握了握他的手，警告他在下次使徒来袭时不要妨碍她。渚薰微笑着告诉她，他无意阻碍她。

I look across at the showers before slowly getting up and walking towards them. I carefully take the towel off and step inside and let the warm water wash over me. Immediately I'm aware of his presence near to me.  
我环顾四周的淋浴间，缓缓起身，朝它们走去。我小心翼翼地取下毛巾，踏入其中，任由温暖的水流冲刷着我。立刻，我察觉到他就在我附近。

"O-Oh hey…" “哦——嘿…”

"The Second Child… she is competitive when it comes to piloting…"  
“第二适格者…她在驾驶方面很有竞争力…”

Smiling I nod, "Asuka is… very competitive, she worked hard to be the best but… she's more than that! She is kind, and… really clever and…"  
我微笑着点头，“明日香她……非常争强好胜，她努力成为最好的，但……她远不止如此！她很善良，而且……真的非常聪明和……”

"You like the Second very much don't you?"  
“你很喜欢二号机驾驶员，对吧？”

"Yeah… Asuka is very special to me."  
“嗯……明日香对我来说非常特别。”

"I see, she brings you happiness?"  
"我明白了，她带给你快乐吗？"

"Yeah… before I came here, I didn't think I could be happy, I didn't think I deserved to be happy. My father had left me with my old teacher. I didn't really have any friends or aspirations. I came here and they just wanted me to pilot Eva but Asuka… she and I…"  
"是的……在我来这里之前，我从未想过自己能快乐，也不觉得自己配得上快乐。父亲把我留给了我的老导师。我几乎没有朋友，也没有什么抱负。来到这里后，他们只是让我驾驶 Eva，但明日香……她和我……"

Why am I telling him this despite knowing what he is? Why am I opening up to Kaworu like this? I know I shouldn't but I can't help it.  
明知他是谁，为何我还要告诉他这些？为何我会像这样向渚薰敞开心扉？我知道我不该这么做，但我无法控制自己。

"I am glad you found the happiness that you seek Shinji Ikari."  
"我很高兴你找到了你所追求的幸福，碇真嗣。"

"Yeah… me too." "是啊……我也是。"

"I often feel that humans go their lives feeling that they have to suffer to truly live. Your hearts are so delicate."  
"我常常觉得，人们一生都在感觉必须受苦才能真正活出滋味。你们的心是如此脆弱。"

"B-But… a world without that suffering would be meaningless, we wouldn't be able to find true happiness without that suffering first. It'd just end up being empty."  
"但…没有那种痛苦的世界是无意义的，没有先经历痛苦，我们无法找到真正的幸福。那样只会变得空洞。"

He looks surprised by my words. Maybe I'm surprised at them myself but it's true. I don't like pain, I hate feeling pain and I'm terrified of it or being betrayed. Yet I know I have to feel it, I have to go through it so I can be happy. Without feeling it, I wouldn't know what makes me happy. It'd be like I told him, empty.  
他对我这番话显得很惊讶。或许我自己也对此感到惊讶，但这是真的。我不喜欢痛苦，我讨厌感受痛苦，也害怕痛苦或被背叛。然而我知道我必须经历它，我必须经历这些才能获得幸福。没有感受过痛苦，我就不会知道什么能让我快乐。正如我告诉他的，那样只会空洞。

"Emptiness would be another type of suffering…"  
"空虚将是另一种形式的痛苦…"

"Y-Yeah..." "嗯-嗯..."

"I am pleased that you realize that."  
"我很高兴你意识到了这一点。"

"Me too…" "我也是…"

He turns to me just as the lights suddenly go off in the shower room. I can still make out his eyes and smile. He eyes are staring straight into mine and I feel nervous. Not because of the proximity or because we're both naked but because it feels like he knows more than he is saying. It feels like he's looking into me. It was like that the other time only I didn't know what he was then. This time I'm more conscious and it's scaring me.  
他转向我，就在这时淋浴间的灯突然熄灭了。我仍能辨认出他的眼睛和微笑。他的目光直直地盯着我，我感到紧张。不是因为距离近或我们俩都赤裸，而是因为他似乎知道得比说出来的多。感觉他正看透我。上次也是这样，只是当时我不知道他在看什么。这次我更加清醒，这让我害怕。

"After all, we can't redo that which has already been done, no matter how much we might desire it."  
毕竟，无论我们多么渴望，已经发生的事是无法重来的。

One more glance from him and he walks out of the room. I stand there and watch him thinking about what he's just said to me. We can't redo what has been done…  
他又看了我一眼，然后走出了房间。我站在那里，想着他刚才对我说的话。已经发生的事，我们无法重来……

### Chapter 18 Catalyst III
**Day 14 第 14 天**

I promised myself I wasn't going to cry here. I tried my best to not cry but I couldn't uphold that promise to myself. No matter how hard it was or got I wasn't going to but I had a dream last night. I had a dream that he finally woke up and he had forgotten who I was. He remembered Fuyutsuki, Misato and all the others here but he had forgotten about me. He couldn't remember any of our time together, it was as if I had never existed in his life. I woke up fifteen minutes ago in all I've done in that time is sat here and cried as quietly as I can, clutching my knees up to my chest.  
我曾对自己许诺，不会在这里哭泣。我尽力不哭，却未能守住那份承诺。无论多么艰难，我本不打算流泪，但昨晚我做了一个梦。梦见他终于醒来，却忘记了我是谁。他记得冬月、美里和其他所有人，唯独忘了我。他记不起我们共度的时光，仿佛我从未在他生命中存在过。醒来后，十五分钟过去了，我所能做的只是坐在这里，尽量安静地哭泣，双膝紧抱胸前。

He won't forget about me, I know that. He can't forget about me, but there is that voice in my mind asking me what if he does? What if when Shinji wakes up he can't remember me? I know it's a possibility, they haven't told me but I'm not an idiot. I've seen what can happen to people in hospitals. What if the same thing that happened to my mother happens to Shinji? When he wakes up he can't remember me? Or doesn't recognize me?  
他不会忘记我，我知道。他不可能忘记我，但脑海中有个声音在问，万一他忘了呢？万一真嗣醒来时记不起我怎么办？我知道这有可能，他们虽未明说，但我不是傻瓜。我见过医院里人们可能遭遇的事。万一我母亲那样的遭遇发生在真嗣身上呢？他醒来时记不起我？或者认不出我？

I wipe another tear from my cheek and finally sit up looking around. I need to calm myself down but I don't really know what I can do. I can see the small clock in here and it's half three in the morning. Misato said I could visit her if I needed to talk but, can I really talk to her? Shinji has been the only one I've been able to lay out my feelings for and talk to. Misato… I like Misato, she is trying but I don't know if I'm able to talk to her. Besides I don't want to inconvenience her, it's so early. I know I need to leave this room for a short time though and do something to clear my mind.  
我擦去脸颊上的另一滴泪水，终于坐起身来环顾四周。我需要让自己冷静下来，但我真的不知道能做些什么。我可以看到这里的小时钟，现在是凌晨三点半。美里说过，如果需要谈话，我可以去找她，但我真的能和她谈心吗？真嗣一直是我唯一能倾诉心事并与之交谈的人。美里……我喜欢美里，她在努力，但我不确定自己能否和她谈心。此外，我也不想给她添麻烦，时间还这么早。我知道我需要暂时离开这个房间，做点什么来清理思绪。

I throw the covers back and quietly climb off of the bed. My bare feet immediately recoil at the coldness of the tiled floor. I feel the coolness around my naked legs and shiver slightly. I immediately look for the discarded pair of pyjama bottoms on the floor and put them on. I grab a hoodie I've thrown over the chair and put that on over my pyjama top. I grab the MP3 player and put in the headphones, I hear the opening notes of Lamb Lies Down on Broadway fill my ears and do the best I can to make it look like I haven't spent the past fifteen minutes crying.  
我掀开被子，悄悄地从床上爬下来。赤脚一触到冰冷的瓷砖地面，立刻缩了回来。我感受到裸露双腿周围的凉意，微微颤抖。我立刻在地上寻找那条被丢弃的睡裤并穿上。我拿起扔在椅子上的连帽衫，套在睡衣上衣外面。我抓起 MP3 播放器，戴上耳机，听到《霸王别姬》开头的音符充盈耳际，尽我所能让自己看起来不像刚哭过十五分钟的样子。

I step out of the room and look around the corridor. The lights are dimmed and there doesn't seem to be anyone around either. I don't know where I'm going, I don't really have a lot of choice at the moment. Even during the day time they've restricted our movements. Funny how when it was only me and Shinji here we had no issues with going from place to place and being safe. Now we have groups of people here and it's all restricted with curfews and other rules and regulations. I'm thankful people are here and returned but at the same time I miss the times when it was just me and Shinji. When we weren't under the threat of people wanting to kill us.  
我走出房间，环顾走廊。灯光昏暗，似乎也没有人在附近。我不知道该去哪里，眼下确实没有太多选择。即使在白天，我们的行动也受到限制。有趣的是，当这里只有我和真嗣时，我们四处走动并确保安全毫无问题。现在这里聚集了许多人，一切都受到宵禁和其他规章制度的限制。我感激人们在这里并回来了，但同时我也怀念那些只有我和真嗣的时光。那时我们没有受到想要杀我们的人的威胁。

When he wakes up, when this is over and we can leave maybe we should go somewhere quiet. Maybe I'll finally go diving like I've always wanted to, maybe I'll teach Shinji how to swim. Maybe we can go somewhere with our own private pool. We can find some interesting things to do in our own pool, we could go skinny dipping and…  
当他醒来，当这一切结束后，也许我们可以去某个安静的地方。也许我终于可以去潜水了，就像我一直想做的那样，也许我会教真嗣游泳。也许我们可以去一个有私人泳池的地方。我们可以在自己的泳池里找到一些有趣的事情做，我们可以裸泳，然后……

I grin as the thoughts cross my mind of just what we could do. He'd look so embarrassed at first wouldn't he? He'd blush and cover himself up as I swam around making sure he got a good view of me. I'd taunt him to get into the water and he'd slowly and awkwardly climb in. Then I'd swim up to him and playfully splash him and swim away from him on my back. I'd watch as he wouldn't know what to do with himself. Then I'd…  
我咧嘴一笑，脑海中浮现出我们能做些什么。他一开始肯定会很尴尬，不是吗？他会脸红，遮掩自己，而我则在水中游来游去，确保他好好欣赏我。我会逗他下水，他会慢慢而笨拙地爬进来。然后我会游向他，开玩笑地泼他水，然后仰泳着远离他。我会看着他不知所措的样子。然后我会……

I blink the ideas away, bad Asuka. Half three in the morning and walking through a corridor is not the time to think about what you'd do to your boyfriend in a pool. That's for other places. I realize that I've been so lost in my thoughts I'd actually arrived somewhere. I look around the room and realize it's the facilities arboretum. The smell of flowers fills my nostrils and I look around amongst the sea of colours. I'm not really a flowers type girl, so walking through here has never really occurred to me before. I can appreciate their beauty but I'd never really want Shinji to give me flowers nor do I have any interest in growing my own. I'd rather grow something more practical like the melons a few rows away from me.  
我眨眼驱散这些念头，坏阿斯卡。凌晨三点半，走在走廊上，不是想这些在泳池里对男朋友做什么的时候。那是其他场合的事。我意识到自己完全沉浸在思绪中，竟然已经到了某个地方。我环顾四周，发现这是设施的植物园。花香扑鼻而来，我在五彩缤纷的花海中四处张望。我并不是那种喜欢花的女孩，所以从未想过要在这里散步。我可以欣赏它们的美，但从未想过要让真嗣送我花，也没有兴趣自己种植。我宁愿种一些更实用的东西，比如离我几排远的瓜果。

Shinji told me that Kaji used to grow melons in the Geofront. He said that Kaji shown him the melon patch he had just shortly before the fourteenth Angel attacked. I never thought Kaji would be the type to do any gardening. I never knew Kaji had a sister nor did I know he was a double or even triple agent working against NERV and SEELE. There was so much I didn't know about him, or anything really.  
真嗣告诉我，加持以前在 Geofront 种过瓜。他说，在第十四使徒袭击前不久，加持还带他去看过那片瓜地。我从没想过加持会是那种会做园艺的人。我从未知道加持有个妹妹，也不知道他是 NERV 和 SEELE 的双重甚至三重间谍。关于他，我还有很多不知道的事情，真的很多。

I look down at the melons and I realize there is someone else in the room with me. I look around and see its Kaji's sister. I pause the music and take out my earphones just in time for her to look up at me and smile.  
我低头看着那些瓜，意识到房间里还有其他人。我环顾四周，发现是加持的妹妹。我暂停了音乐，摘下耳机，正好她抬头看向我，微笑着。

"You're up late…" “你这么晚还没睡…”

I nod. I wonder how much she knows about what happened between me and Misato last week. Her people delegated the running of the facility to Fuyutsuki and Misato. Myself and Shinji could have done it but we weren't given the choice. I guess despite all we came through they still see us as something less than what we are. Not that I had any interest in running this place.  
我点点头。不知道她对我和美里上周发生的事了解多少。她的人把设施的管理权交给了冬月和美里。我和真嗣本也可以胜任，但我们没有选择的余地。我想，尽管我们经历了那么多，他们仍然认为我们不够格。并非我对管理这个地方有兴趣。

"Yeah… I had trouble sleeping… damn machines in that room keep me awake sometimes…"  
“是啊……我睡不好……那房间里的机器有时让我无法入睡……”

I lie about my reasons for being awake, she doesn't need to know about the bad dreams. No one needs to know about them, they're between me and Shinji when I tell him.  
我隐瞒了醒着的真正原因，她不需要知道那些噩梦。没人需要知道，当我告诉真嗣时，它们只存在于我和他之间。

"Yeah… how is Shinji doing?"  
"是啊……真嗣怎么样了？"

I look away, "He's alive, but he'll wake up eventually. He has me looking after him now, I'm not going to fail him."  
我移开视线，“他还活着，但最终会醒来的。现在由我来照顾他，我不会让他失望的。”

"I know you won't, you know Ryoji told me all about you."  
"我知道你不会的，你知道吗，里 oji 都告诉我关于你的事了。"

Hearing his name piques my interest, he spoke about me to her? Even though I know those feelings I had for him were false, they were just what I thought I wanted, an attempt to make me seem more adult than normal I can't help but still feel something for him. He did look after me for all that time, he genuinely cared and he put up with me. He never tried to pry into my past or my life and he accepted me for what I was.  
听到他提起我的名字，我不禁感到好奇，他向她谈起了我？尽管我知道自己对他的那些感情是虚假的，只是我以为自己想要的，试图让自己看起来比实际更成熟，但我还是忍不住对他有所感觉。他确实在那段时间里照顾我，真心关怀，并且忍受了我。他从未试图探究我的过去或生活，而是接受了我本来的样子。

"H-He did?" “他真的提到了我？”

"Yeah, the German prodigy. Elite Evangelion pilot, chosen at the age of four and a college degree before the age of fourteen. He was really proud of you, he said it was like having a kid sister again. I… actually I got a little bit jealous of the two of you."  
“是啊，那位德国的天才。精英福音战士驾驶员，四岁就被选中，十四岁前就获得了大学学位。他真的很为你骄傲，他说这让他感觉又有了一个小妹妹。我……其实我还有点嫉妒你们俩呢。”

I bow my head feeling slightly guilty because of her words. Here I was feeling sorry for myself as usual and in front of me is the person whose place I took for a time. He thought of me as a kid sister while he couldn't see his real sister.  
我低头感到一丝内疚，因为她的这番话。我一如既往地为自己感到难过，而眼前这位，正是我曾一度取代其位置的人。他将我视为一个小妹妹，而他却无法见到自己的亲妹妹。

"I… I'm sorry…" “我……我很抱歉……”

"No, don't apologize. I'm glad he was happy… it was nice to just hear from him. He always said that his goal was to get you and Shinji out of there when he was able to… I guess he kept that promise in some strange way… just a shame he wasn't around to see it…"  
“不，别道歉。我很高兴他曾快乐过……能听到他的消息真好。他总是说，他的目标是能在有能力时把你和真嗣救出来……我想，他以某种奇特的方式履行了那个承诺……只是可惜，他没能亲眼见证这一切……”

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

He wanted to take me and Shinji away from NERV? When? I suppose it'd have been after all the Angels were defeated. After SEELE had been stopped. Move us into his group and keep us safe. I don't know if I'd have liked that then, I wasn't… in the right state of mind. I wouldn't have agreed to it, especially not with Shinji. I'd have wanted to keep piloting if I could, or if I was still on my downward spiral I'd have… well I'd probably be dead by now.  
他想把我跟真嗣从 NERV 带走？什么时候？我想应该是在所有使徒都被击败之后，SEELE 也被阻止之后。把我们纳入他的组织，保护我们。我不知道当时我是否会喜欢那样，我那时……心态不对。我不会同意的，尤其是和真嗣一起。如果能继续驾驶，我会想继续，或者如果我还在那条下坡路上，我……嗯，现在可能已经死了。

I'm sorry Kaji, you believed in me and my ability didn't you? You knew the truth behind it all though but you believed I'd pull through and be happy. I was never happy, I was fucked up and I lost all of what I thought I was worth. I thought all I was was piloting Eva, I didn't see the people who cared or I just pushed them away. I wonder if you really knew what I was before you died?  
对不起，加持，你相信我，相信我的能力对吧？你知道这一切背后的真相，但你相信我能挺过去，会快乐。我从未快乐过，我一团糟，失去了所有我认为自己值得的东西。我以为我的一切就是驾驶 EVA，我没有看到关心我的人，或者我只是把他们推开。你死前真的了解我是什么样的人吗？

I look across at Rebecca, I wonder if she knows about that stuff. I wonder if she knows about my past. I decide to ask.  
我看着丽贝卡，不知道她是否了解那些事。不知道她是否了解我的过去。我决定问她。

"D-Do you… Did Kaji ever talk about… y'know… my past?"  
"你…你…Kaji 有没有提起过…你知道的…我的过去？"

Her eyes lock onto mine and I know instantly he had told her. I know that she knows everything about it. My mother's accident and suicide, my hatred for my father and my dislike of my stepmother. She knows all about it. For a moment I think she is going to lie and shake her head but instead she slowly nods.  
她的目光紧紧锁住我的眼睛，我立刻明白他已经告诉了她。我知道她了解这一切。我母亲的意外和自杀，我对父亲的憎恨以及对继母的不喜欢。她全都知道。有那么一刻，我以为她会撒谎并摇头否认，但她却缓缓地点了点头。

"Yes, I know… he told me what you had been through."  
"是的，我知道…他告诉了我你所经历的一切。"

"I see…" "我明白了…"

"Don't be mad at him… he… that was one of the reasons he wanted to get you and Shinji out of there so desperately. He knew the longer you were there the harder it would be but he… wasn't able to do anything…"  
"别生他的气……他……其中一个原因就是他迫切想让你和真嗣离开那里。他知道你们在那儿待得越久，情况就越糟糕，但他……无能为力……"

"Because of the Angels… as long as there were Angels attacking us we had to stay."  
"因为使徒……只要使徒还在攻击我们，我们就必须留下。"

"Exactly." "确实。"

There is another silence between the two of us. I get the feeling she wants to say more but she is wary of me. This has happened to me quite a lot in my life. People always want to say more to me but they've heard the stories about me. About how bratty I could be, about how I just tell them I'm fine and I don't care. They hear about how I threw away the toys I got given to play with and how I aggressive I was. How I didn't give a crap about if people could relate to me. Maybe once she'd be right to be wary of me but not tonight. I'm too tired to give up a fight or put up any defences now. If she said something I'd probably just listen. Thankfully she does, just as the tiredness sets in and I feel myself wanting to go back to bed.  
我们之间又陷入了沉默。我感觉她想再说些什么，但又对我有所顾忌。这种事在我生活中屡见不鲜。人们总想对我说更多，但他们听过关于我的种种传闻。关于我有多任性，关于我总是说自己没事、不在乎。他们听说我把收到的玩具扔掉，我有多么好斗。我根本不在乎别人是否能理解我。也许她曾经有理由对我保持警惕，但今晚不会。我太累了，无力再争斗或设防。如果她开口，我大概只会静静聆听。幸运的是，她确实开口了，就在我感到疲惫袭来，想要回到床上的时候。

"I should probably go back to bed…"  
"我或许应该回床上继续睡…"

Here it comes. 它来了。

"Wait… I, just wanted to say. You're a really strong person Asuka. Most people, after what you've been through they'd wash their hands of it and give up but you… you haven't. From the start no matter what you think you've always tried and tried hard, and since you've been back you've…"  
"等等…我，只是想说。你真的很坚强，明日香。大多数人经历了你所经历的那些事后，都会选择放弃，但你…你没有。从一开始，无论你怎么想，你总是努力尝试，而且非常努力，自从你回来后，你…"

I turn around and laugh. It wasn't quite what I expected but I can't help but laugh at how wrong she is, "I'm not strong. You've got the wrong person. Shinji is the strong one… I'm just plain old Asuka, I try and well… that's the best of it."  
我转过身，笑了起来。这并不完全是我所预料的，但我忍不住笑她错得离谱，“我不坚强。你找错人了。真嗣才是坚强的人……我只是普通的明日香，我尝试着，嗯……这就是最好的结果了。”

"You're wrong Asuka, you are strong. Anyone else would have closed their heart off by now but you… you came back and you looked after Shinji. You and he… you looked after each other. You both survived because of each other's strength and even now… you won't give up on him. You are a strong person Asuka."  
“你错了，明日香，你很坚强。换作别人早就封闭了心扉，但你……你回来了，还照顾了真嗣。你和他……你们互相照顾。你们能活下来是因为彼此的力量，甚至现在……你也没有放弃他。你是个坚强的人，明日香。”

I want to tell her she is wrong but all I can do is blush like a little school girl. I stutter out some form of gratitude, "T-Thank you… I'm going back to bed now. Good night."  
我想告诉她她错了，但我所能做的只是像个害羞的小女生一样脸红。我结结巴巴地表达了感谢，“谢、谢谢你……我现在要回去睡觉了。晚安。”

"Good night." “晚安。”

**Day 15 第 15 天**

A darkened meeting room, a table with files on it. Stoney looking faces on the occupants of the seats. I didn't think I'd be in this sort of environment again. I didn't think I'd be talking about strategies and Angels again but here I am. I look between the other two occupants of the room. Rebecca and Fuyutsuki. We decided to tell Rebecca the news about Shinji yesterday, about what we suspect to be an Angel living inside him.  
一间昏暗的会议室，桌上堆满了文件。座位上的人面色凝重。我没想到会再次置身于这样的环境。我没想到会再次讨论策略和使徒，但我现在就在这里。我看着房间里的另外两个人。丽贝卡和冬月。昨天我们决定告诉丽贝卡关于真嗣的消息，关于我们怀疑他体内有使徒的事情。

"I… I don't understand, I thought they were all gone? There was only supposed to be 17 right?"  
"我…我不明白，我以为它们都消失了？应该只有 17 个才对吧？"

Fuyutsuki bows his head in agreement, "18 if you count the Lilin, or humanity as the 18th Angel but… well that was never confirmed. The Dead Sea Scrolls did allude to such things but in all honesty we and SEELE never did fully understand the nature of Adam and Lilith. We understood enough to utilize them."  
冬月点了点头表示同意，“如果算上莉林人，或者说人类作为第 18 个使徒的话，那就是 18 个……但这一点从未得到证实。《死海古卷》确实暗示了这些，但说实话，我们和 Seele 从未完全理解亚当和莉莉丝的本质。我们了解得足够多，可以利用它们。”

I raise my eyebrows, "So there could be more?"  
我挑了挑眉，“所以可能还有更多？”

"I don't know, there aren't any rules. Third Impact was supposed to compress all life into one. Shinji averted that, it gave humanity a chance to live and we have to suspect that the same rules might apply to the Angels as well."  
“我不知道，没有规则可循。第三次冲击本应将所有生命压缩成一体。真嗣阻止了那一切，给了人类生存的机会，我们不得不怀疑同样的规则也可能适用于使徒。”

Rebecca looks between the two of us. I imagine a lot of what we are saying is going over her head. Third Impact didn't happen for her, or at least it doesn't feel like it happened to her. Somehow the rest of humanity was brought into it but they were deposited back as they were without having to emerge from the seas of LCL like we did.  
丽贝卡在我们两人之间来回看着。我想我们说的很多内容她可能都听得一头雾水。第三次冲击对她来说没有发生，或者说她感觉不到那件事对她产生了影响。不知怎么地，人类整体被卷入了其中，但他们又被原封不动地送了回来，不必像我们那样从 LCL 之海中浮现。

She never saw it, she knows vaguely what happened from what she has been told by Fuyutsuki but so much of it will be new to her. A lot of it is new to me, there was so much I didn't know until I started speaking to Fuyutsuki. The origins of Adam and Lilith, who created them and where they came from and what really happened to Shinji and Asuka's mother. I've had a crash course in global conspiracies.  
她从未亲眼目睹，只是从副校长口中模糊地了解了一些情况，所以很多细节对她来说都是全新的。对我来说也是如此，直到我开始与副校长交谈，我才了解到许多我之前不知道的事情。关于亚当和莉莉丝的起源，他们的创造者以及他们的来历，还有真嗣和明日香母亲的真实遭遇。我经历了一场全球阴谋的速成课程。

None of that bothers me right now though, all I'm bothered about is the welfare of Shinji and Asuka. I want that thing out of Shinji as soon as possible.  
不过，这些现在都不困扰我，我唯一担心的是真嗣和明日香的安危。我希望那东西能尽快从真嗣体内移除。

"So what do we know so far?"  
“那么，我们目前了解到什么情况？”

"Little, what we've observed is two points so far in which Shinji has experienced a high level of brain activity coupled with a surge in adrenaline. The first time we didn't see anything and had no reason to be concerned. We don't know what he is experiencing at the moment and have no way of knowing, it was reasonable to assume it was a reaction from a dream."  
“很少，我们观察到目前为止，真嗣经历了两次大脑活动高度活跃并伴有肾上腺素激增的情况。第一次我们什么也没看到，也没有理由担心。我们现在不知道他正在经历什么，也没有办法知道，合理推测可能是梦境引起的反应。”

"And the second time?" "第二次呢？"

"The second time we observed a rise in brain activity and adrenaline again. This however created another unusual anomaly. We detected a Blood Pattern Blue reading from within Shinji. It was miniscule, barely noticeable and it went away as quickly as it appeared."  
"第二次我们再次观察到脑活动和肾上腺素的上升。然而，这又引发了一个不寻常的异常现象。我们在真嗣体内检测到了微弱的血迹蓝光读数。它极其微小，几乎难以察觉，并且出现后迅速消失。"

I look up, "So can we assume the spike in brain activity and adrenaline had something to do with it."  
我抬起头，"那么我们可以假设脑活动和肾上腺素的激增与此有关吗？"

Fuyutsuki nods, "Normally I'd say we don't have enough evidence to draw any conclusions but this is desperate so yes. I believe the Angel is possibly parasitic in nature, it's using these spikes in Shinjis chemistry to feed and grow."  
冬月点头，“通常我会说我们证据不足，无法得出结论，但情况紧急，所以是的。我相信使徒可能具有寄生性质，它利用这些在新治体内的化学物质尖峰来摄取养分并成长。”

"So how did it get inside him?"  
“那么它是怎么进入他体内的？”

To my surprise it is not Fuyutsuki who answer me but instead it is Rebecca, "I might have an answer for that. The people who shot Shinji, it's possible they weren't trying to kill him."  
令我惊讶的是，回答我的不是冬月，而是丽贝卡，“那些射伤真嗣的人，可能他们并非试图杀死他。”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"The bullet that hit Shinji, it hit no vital organs he was at no risk from the wound at all. When you think about it isn't that strange? They had a clean shot at him, when they attacked he wasn't being pulled around or moving much. If they wanted to kill him they could have done."  
"击中真嗣的那颗子弹，并没有伤及他的要害器官，他完全没有因这个伤口而面临危险。想想看，这难道不奇怪吗？他们有绝佳的射击机会，袭击时他并未被拖拽或大幅移动。如果他们真想杀他，完全可以做到。"

As she says her words I feel my stomach drop as I realize she is right. I was just so happy for him to be alive I never questioned it. Yet when I look back on it they could easily have killed him, and Asuka for that matter.  
当她说出这些话时，我感到胃部一阵下沉，意识到她是对的。我只是太高兴他还活着，从未质疑过这一点。然而，当我回想起那一切，他们本可以轻易地杀死他，还有明日香。

"I didn't understand why he fell into a coma like this, it was a bullet wound. It wouldn't have been pleasant but he should have woken up by now. Yet now that we have seen this it makes sense… they weren't trying to kill him. They were…"  
"我不明白他为何会陷入这样的昏迷，那只是一处枪伤。虽然不会愉快，但他应该早就醒来了。然而现在看来，这一切都说得通了……他们并非想要杀他。他们是在……"

Fuyutsuki finished the sentence for her, "…Implanting him with an Angel."  
冬月替她完成了这句话，“……给他植入了一个天使。”

I look around the room stunned and feeling queasy at the way this conversation has turned, "But… why?"  
我环顾四周，震惊不已，对这个话题的转变感到恶心，“但是……为什么？”

Rebecca gives me the answer straight away, "There are… groups out there who were and are sympathetic to SEELE's cause. It stands to reason that one of them would try something like this, some of them are well funded and have resources or they could have inherited some of the resources belonging to SEELE. It's possible they are looking at a way to… well…"  
丽贝卡立刻给了我答案，“外面有一些……团体，他们过去和现在都同情 SEELE 的事业。有理由认为其中一些人会尝试这样的事情，他们资金充足，拥有资源，或者可能继承了 SEELE 的一些资源。他们可能正在寻找一种方法来……嗯……”

She seems hesitant to finish, "Finish what SEELE started… yeah. I get it."  
"她似乎犹豫着要不要说完，“完成 SEELE 开始的事情……是的，我明白了。””

I grit my teeth and stand up, "We aren't going to let them and I'll be damned if I'm going to let them use Shinji again like that. I want that think out of Shinji as soon as possible, we… they fought and sacrificed too much to be drawn back into that."  
"我咬紧牙关站起身，“我们不会让他们得逞，我绝不会让他们再次利用真嗣。我希望尽快把那东西从真嗣身上取出来，我们……他们付出了太多牺牲，不能再被卷进去了。””

"I understand, I'll do everything I can."  
"“我明白，我会尽我所能。””

Fuyutsuki nods and leaves the room, Rebecca stays in her seat looking at me. She seems uncertain of what to say now that we're alone. Of course that would make sense, I was her brother's former lover. I was the one who left him all those years ago and got back with him only for him to die shortly afterwards. If I hadn't been so stubborn maybe he wouldn't have died, I could have helped him sooner and helped him escape. I wonder if she blames me, I wonder if she hates me?  
冬月点了点头，离开了房间，丽贝卡则留在座位上看着我。她似乎不确定在我们独处时该说些什么。当然，这很合理，我曾经是她哥哥的前恋人。多年前是我离开了他，后来又重新在一起，结果他不久后就去世了。如果我没有那么固执，也许他就不会死，我本可以更早地帮助他，帮助他逃脱。我不知道她是否责怪我，不知道她是否恨我？

"Rebecca I-" “丽贝卡，我——”

"It's fine, I know what you're thinking and the answer is no. Ryoji chose his path and neither of us could have done anything about it. All we can do now is make sure his sacrifice wasn't in vain. I'll have my people investigate who could have done this. We know of a few groups operating who might be capable. We will stop them, and we'll save Shinji as well."  
“没关系，我知道你在想什么，答案是否定的。亮司选择了自己的道路，我们谁也无法改变。现在我们能做的就是确保他的牺牲没有白费。我会让我的人调查是谁做的这件事。我们知道有几个可能有能力做的组织。我们会阻止他们，也会救出真嗣。”

I'm fighting back tears as I nod. My heart is twisted right now but I don't let her see that. I need to stay strong. She walks past me and I hear the door close. Almost immediately I sink back into a seat and let the tears flow.  
我强忍泪水，点了点头。此刻我的心纠结不已，但我没有让她察觉。我需要保持坚强。她从我身边走过，我听到门关上的声音。几乎立刻，我瘫坐在椅子上，任由泪水流淌。

"Oh Shinji… why did this have to happen?"  
“真嗣啊……为什么会发生这种事？”

---

Fifteen days Shinji has been inside this coma. Here I am again, sitting beside him after my day. I've been thinking again about what we are going to do when he eventually wakes up. He'll probably be weak when he wakes up, having been in bed for so long so he'll need some form of exercise. I can help with that. I'll take him on walks. I know the scenery isn't much around here but we have places to explore. We can go to a different part of the beach, I'll make lunch for him for a change.  
真嗣已经陷入昏迷十五天了。我又一次坐在他身边，度过了一天。我一直在思考，当他最终醒来时，我们该做些什么。他醒来时可能会很虚弱，毕竟在床上躺了这么久，所以他需要一些锻炼。我可以帮忙。我会带他去散步。我知道这附近风景不多，但我们有地方可以探索。我们可以去海滩的另一处，我会为他准备午餐，换换口味。

Then when he stronger we'll go further. We might even be able to leave this place eventually. I spoke to Misato about it. She was looking at the possibility of getting us sent to where our classmates were. Putting us back in school and letting us have a normal. I have to admit I don't really know if I can see them all again. The way I was before, how horrible I was to Hikari. Making her worry like that. I don't know if I can do that.  
等到他更强壮些，我们就走得更远。或许最终我们还能离开这个地方。我和美里谈过这件事。她正在考虑把我们送到同学们所在的地方。让我们重新回到学校，过上正常的生活。我得承认，我不知道自己是否还能再见到他们。以前的我，对光那么恶劣，让她那样担心。我不知道我是否能做到。

Shinji's friends as well, as much as I dislike them they are still his friends. I know that they hate me and they're right to hate me. After what I put him through. I don't know how he'd feel about seeing them again either. He's be terrified as well. He blames himself for what happened to Touji, he feels like he could have done more even though Touji told him otherwise.  
真嗣的朋友们也一样，尽管我不喜欢他们，但他们仍然是他的朋友。我知道他们恨我，他们有理由恨我。毕竟我让他经历了那么多。我也不知道他再次见到他们会是什么感觉。他也会感到害怕。他自责于对冬二所做的一切，尽管冬二告诉他不是他的错，他仍觉得自己本可以做得更多。

We'd be better off going elsewhere. Somewhere quiet where we can just live on our own. We can attend a school but with new people who don't know us. It'll be easier for us that way. Yet I know that won't happen. The time will come when we reunite with those people and it is something we have to do. We promised we wouldn't run away and making amends with those people is a part of that.  
我们最好去别的地方。找个安静的地方，我们可以独自生活。我们可以上学，但和那些不认识我们的人一起。这样对我们来说会更容易。然而我知道这不会发生。总有一天我们会和那些人重逢，这是我们必须面对的。我们承诺过不会逃避，与那些人修正是其中的一部分。

I'll try to put it off though as long as I can. Until we're both ready for it. I'm going to make sure we get a holiday first. We deserve that much, we saved the world.  
我会尽量拖延，能拖多久就拖多久。直到我们都准备好。我要确保我们先度个假。我们值得这一点，我们拯救了世界。

I feel a little bit of pride at that thought. Probably for the first time since I returned I actually feel a little bit of pride. We actually saved the world. The fucked up redhead and the shy kid. We somehow managed to save it. When we do eventually reunite with them we're going to be hailed as heroes. By our classmates at least, the rest of the world doesn't know who we are. Or at least the ones who do are probably undecided, until they learn the truth of course.  
想到这一点，我感到一丝自豪。或许是我回来后第一次真正感到自豪。我们真的拯救了世界。那个麻烦的红发女孩和害羞的孩子。我们不知怎么地做到了。当我们最终与他们重聚时，我们会被视为英雄。至少我们的同学会这样，世界其他地方的人不知道我们是谁。或者至少那些知道的人可能还在犹豫，直到他们了解真相。

It's not much use thinking about this sort of thing though. I'm not here to think, I'm here to speak. I already have a track selected for tonight. It's one of the songs that got me into this sort of music. I haven't played it for him yet.  
不过，想这些也没什么用。我来这里不是为了思考，而是为了说话。今晚我已经选好了一首歌。是这首歌让我喜欢上了这种音乐。我还没给他放过。

"Hey Shinji…" “嘿，真嗣……”

I don't really have a lot to say today. Truth is not a lot happened. Misato and the others were in a meeting for part of it. They won't tell me what it was about so I spent most of my day in the arboretum or in our room playing video games.  
今天我其实没什么可说的。说实话，没发生什么大事。美里和其他人有一段时间在开会。他们不告诉我内容，所以我大部分时间都在植物园或者我们房间里打游戏。

"Nothing really happened today Shinji… I… I finally took a walk around the arboretum though. It was pretty I guess, loads of flowers but I don't really care about those. I've never really been bothered by flowers. I used to look at the gardens in the GeoFront when we were down there and I always used to be puzzled by it. I never saw the point, we were at war and the Geofront was a place for the Eva's. Not for flowers.  
今天真的没什么事，真嗣……不过，我终于在植物园里散了散步。那里挺美的，花很多，但我其实不太在意那些。我从来没被花困扰过。以前在 GeoFront 的时候，我常看那里的花园，总是感到困惑。我从未明白其中的意义，我们在打仗，GeoFront 是放 Eva 的地方。不是为了花。

I think I understand it a bit more now though. It's proof that even in times of death and war we still have the ability to create new life and beauty in the world. That's why Misato attended so many weddings over those months, and why we heard about so many people around town falling pregnant."  
不过，我现在有点理解了。即使在死亡和战争的时期，我们仍有能力创造新生命和世界之美。这就是为什么美里在那几个月参加了那么多婚礼，也是为什么我们听说城里那么多人怀孕。

I pause for a moment thinking about my last statement, marriage and pregnancy. Two things I've never really thought of. I wonder if as an Eva pilot people ever expected me to one day get married and have a baby. That's the dream that is fed to little girls isn't it? Grow up, fall in love with a beautiful man and have a baby. It was never my dream. The thought of having a child, it terrifies me. That's why I always double check the protection we use when we have sex.  
我停顿了一下，思考着我刚才提到的婚姻和怀孕。这两件事我从未真正考虑过。我不知道作为一位 EVA 驾驶员，人们是否曾期待我有一天会结婚生子。这不就是灌输给小女孩的梦想吗？长大成人，爱上一个英俊的男人，然后生个孩子。这从来不是我的梦想。想到要有一个孩子，我感到害怕。这就是为什么我们在发生性行为时总是仔细检查防护措施。

It isn't the pregnancy that scares me. It's being a parent, with the way my parents turned out and how I am how the hell would I ever be a good mother? Looking at Shinji I wonder if he has ever thought the same. Shinji is loving, kind and he can be stern when he needs to be. Yet I know he'd be terrified of the prospect of being a father. He'd be afraid of repeating the mistakes his father made.  
让我害怕的不是怀孕本身。而是成为父母，看看我父母的结局，再看看我自己，我怎么可能成为一个好母亲？看着真嗣，我想知道他是否也有过同样的想法。真嗣充满爱心，善良，必要时也能严厉。然而我知道，他对于成为父亲的前景也会感到恐惧。他会担心重蹈他父亲的覆辙。

I realize I'm lost in my thoughts again and turn back to Shinji, "I saw Rebecca while I was in there the first time. I… well last night I had a bad dream so I went for a walk. I ended up going in there and she was there too looking at some melons. I think she grew them, like brother like sister huh?  
"我意识到我又陷入了沉思，于是转向真嗣，“我第一次进去的时候看到了丽贝卡。我……嗯，昨晚我做了一个噩梦，所以出去散步了。结果我走进了那里，她也正好在那里看一些甜瓜。我想是她种的，真是有其兄必有其妹，对吧？”

You know… I still don't know a lot about Kaji's death. I didn't want to believe it at first. I thought you were lying to me when you said he wasn't going to come back. I haven't asked Misato about it and… well I guess you wouldn't know. I just wonder who did it."  
你知道吗…关于加持先生的死，我还有很多不清楚的地方。起初我并不愿意相信。当你说他不会回来了，我以为你在骗我。我还没问过美里，而且…嗯，我想你也不会知道。我只是想知道是谁干的。

I pause for a moment, "Sorry… I didn't really prepare anything to say today. I'm talking about some strange things aren't I?"  
我顿了一下，"抱歉…今天我其实没准备说什么。我是不是在说些奇怪的事情？

I try to collect my thoughts to talk about something more positive. Shinji doesn't need to hear about Kaji's death.  
我努力整理思绪，想谈些更积极的话题。真嗣不需要听到关于加持先生死亡的事。

"Misato… is thinking that when you wake up we should see about leaving here and going to where our schoolmates were evacuated to. I don't know if I like that idea… I mean she wants to put us back in school. After we saved the world, don't you think we deserve a break? I mean, we had to survive on our own for over a month. We… well I'm going to suggest she allows us to go on holiday somewhere. They can have guards or whatever I don't care but I'm finally going to get that beach holiday trip I wanted.  
美里…在想，等你醒来后我们应该考虑离开这里，去我们同学被疏散的地方。我不知道我是否喜欢这个主意…我是说她想让我们重新回到学校。在我们拯救了世界之后，你不觉得我们应得一个休息吗？我是说，我们不得不独自生存了一个多月。我们…嗯，我会建议她允许我们去某个地方度假。他们可以派警卫什么的，我不在乎，但我终于要得到那个我一直想要的沙滩假期旅行了。

You remember that don't you? The school trip we were prevented from being on. I had to make use of NERVs pool to dive in and then ended up diving into a live volcano. That was when I think I knew I liked you."  
你还记得那个吗？我们没能参加的学校旅行。我不得不利用 NERV 的泳池潜水，结果最后潜入了一个活火山。就是在那时，我想我知道我喜欢你了。

I bite my lip because I don't just think, I know. I had a suspicion beforehand. The first time was when we fought together in the Eva. I had never felt a connection with someone like that. It was like if we really put our minds and hearts together we could have achieved anything. Two people aren't supposed to be able to operate an Eva like that but we managed it. It was supposed to half our sync ratio, we managed to achieve a higher score than ever.  
我咬了咬嘴唇，因为我不仅仅是觉得，我是知道。我之前就有怀疑。第一次是在我们一起驾驶 EVA 战斗的时候。我从未与某人有过那样的联系。就好像如果我们真的把心和思想放在一起，我们就能实现任何事情。两个人不应该能那样操作 EVA，但我们做到了。原本应该降低我们的同步率，我们却达到了前所未有的高分。

"You saved my life that day, you reached into that volcano selflessly and pulled me out. I should have thanked you, instead I said I owed you one and locked away how good it made me feel that someone actually cared enough to put their life on the line. I thought of it as a debt that had to be paid.  
那天你救了我的命，你无私地深入火山口把我拉了出来。我本该感谢你，却反而说我欠你一个人情，并把那种有人真正在乎到愿意冒生命危险的感觉深藏心底。我以为这是一笔必须偿还的债务。

Yet I knew I liked you, I just couldn't admit it. I kept on making up these stupid little games to tease or taunt you to try to get you to confess first. To see if you'd get the hint but you never did. That just wound me up more to the point where I thought you hated me. Yet it was my fault wasn't it? I was the one pushing you away… but we've been through all that haven't we?"  
然而我知道我喜欢你，只是无法承认。我不断编造这些愚蠢的小游戏来逗弄或嘲讽你，试图让你先表白。想看看你是否能领会我的暗示，但你从未察觉。这反而让我更加纠结，以至于我认为你讨厌我。但这是我的错，不是吗？是我一直在推开你……但我们已经经历过这一切了，不是吗？

This is ridiculous. I keep on trying to talk about things and stay positive but all I do is dwell on the past. It's like a therapy session but instead of talking to a therapist I'm talking to Shinji. I couldn't even bring myself to say these things when he was awake, why am I doing it now?  
这太荒谬了。我一直在尝试谈论事情并保持积极，但我所做的只是沉溺于过去。这就像一场心理治疗，只不过我不是在和心理医生交谈，而是在和真嗣说话。在他醒着的时候，我甚至无法说出这些话，为什么我现在要这么做呢？

"I'm going to play you a song now Shinji. This is one of the first songs I heard… it was…"  
"现在我要给你弹一首歌，真嗣。这是我最早听到的歌曲之一……它是……"

I pause, bringing her up is never easy.  
我停顿了一下，提起她从来都不容易。

"It was one of my mother's favourites, this band was pretty big in Germany when she was young. They recorded an album there. This is from their first album. I really liked the sound of it when I was younger and… well I wanted to learn English so I could understand the lyrics a bit better. So I was always ahead of the others when it came to learning English because of that. Not that that is saying much I'm generally ahead of others as it is aren't I? That's why I have a degree."  
"这是我母亲最喜欢的歌曲之一，这个乐队在她年轻时在德国非常受欢迎。他们在那里录制了一张专辑。这是他们首张专辑里的歌。我小时候非常喜欢它的旋律，而且……嗯，我想学英语，这样我就能更好地理解歌词。所以我在学习英语方面总是比其他人领先一步，这并不奇怪，毕竟我通常在各方面都比别人领先，不是吗？这就是为什么我拥有学位的原因。"

I smile at my own arrogance in saying that. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, despite how fucked up I ended up I'm very proud of what I have managed to do. Why shouldn't I be? I did work hard. I put the earphones into Shinji's ears and also into mine, I take up my usual position of resting my head on his chest while slipping my hand into his. His hands are so warm, even now they provide comfort for me.  
我对自己说出这番傲慢之言时露出了微笑。尽管我最终变得一团糟，但我对自己所取得的成就感到非常自豪。我为何不应该自豪呢？我的确付出了努力。我将耳机塞进真嗣的耳朵，也塞进自己的耳朵，然后像往常一样，将头靠在他的胸前，手滑入他的手中。他的手总是那么温暖，即便现在，依然给我带来安慰。

"The lead singer for this is a guy called Fish by the way, I don't know why he's called that but he is. He's Scottish and has a really poetic style of writing lyrics. I hope you like it."  
顺便说一下，这首歌的主唱是个叫 Fish 的家伙，我不知道他为什么叫这个名字，但他就是。他是苏格兰人，写歌词的风格非常诗意。希望你会喜欢。

I press play and let the music start, closing my eyes as the haunting lyrics begin.  
我按下播放键，让音乐开始，随着那令人难忘的歌词响起，我闭上了眼睛。

### Chapter 19 Don't be
**Day 20 第 20 天**

"Shit, Shinji we need to get up…"  
"该死，真嗣，我们得起床了…"

I slowly open my eyes and see Asuka's naked form sitting up on the side of the bed. She quickly puts on the clean pair of underwear she brought in here last night. I stifle my laughter as the redhead nearly trips over herself in the process. My reward is a pair of socks and my own clean pair of underwear to the face. I quickly slip them on along with the pyjama top.  
我缓缓睁开眼睛，看到明日香赤裸着身子坐在床边。她迅速穿上昨晚带进来的干净内裤。我强忍着笑意，因为红发少女差点在这个过程中摔倒。我的回报是一双袜子和我的干净内裤砸在脸上。我迅速穿上它们，还有睡衣上衣。

"It won't be funny if Misato catches us. Now you remember what we rehearsed right? I'm trying to wake you up because you overslept."  
"要是美里抓到我们就不搞笑了。现在你记得我们排练的内容吧？我试图叫醒你是因为你睡过头了。"

"Uh huh…" “嗯哼…”

She picks up the discarded pyjamas from the floor and slips them on, "Good."  
她从地板上捡起丢弃的睡衣，穿上后说：“好。”

She looks towards the door and then back to me, in response I roll onto my back and close my eyes. I pull the sheets up to my neck. In truth I'm too tired to get up, it's so warm in this bed and a part of me doesn't even care if Misato catches us. I'm happy, Asuka is happy and our friends are happy. Today we'll go to school and even though there are so few of us we'll all be there and we'll laugh and share jokes and eat lunch together. Just five more minutes in here please Asuka.  
她朝门口看了一眼，然后又回头看我，我顺势仰面躺下，闭上眼睛。我把床单拉到脖子处。说实话，我太累了，不想起床，这张床太暖和了，而且我的一部分甚至不在乎美里会不会抓到我们。我很快乐，明日香也很快乐，我们的朋友们也很快乐。今天我们要去上学，虽然人不多，但我们都会在那里，我们会一起笑，分享笑话，一起吃午饭。明日香，请再让我在这里躺五分钟。

I don't get the extra five minutes as I feel her hand playfully slap me followed by her yelling, "Wake up idiot! We'll be late and you still need to make me breakfast!"  
我没能多睡那额外的五分钟，因为她调皮地拍了我一下，紧接着就嚷嚷起来，“醒醒，笨蛋！我们要迟到了，你还得给我做早餐呢！”

Just a few moments later I hear the footsteps approach the door. It slides open and Misato is stood there looking tired herself, "What's all this yelling?"  
仅仅几分钟后，我听到脚步声靠近门口。门滑开了，Misato 站在那里，看起来也很疲惫，“这么吵是怎么回事？”

"My idiot of a boyfriend is going to make us late and he still needs to make us breakfast that's what the yelling is about."  
“我那笨蛋男朋友要让我们迟到了，他还得给我们做早餐，这就是吵闹的原因。”

I feel the covers jerked off of me and the cool air of the room hits my legs. I immediately roll over and try to snatch them back.  
我感觉被子被猛地扯开，房间里的凉气直扑我的双腿。我立刻翻身试图夺回它们。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

Misato shakes her head and walks away, "Knock it off you two, it's still too early for this…"  
美里摇了摇头，走开了，“你们俩别闹了，现在还太早了……”

Asuka follows her out of the room but not before turning to me and giving me a wink, "You see, I told you it'd work."  
明日香跟着她走出房间，临走前还不忘回头对我眨眼，“你看，我就说这招管用。”

---

"And she didn't suspect a thing?"  
"她一点都没怀疑吗？"

"No…"

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

"Of course I'm sure…" "我当然确定…"

"Really?" "真的吗？"

"Shinji, you know what she is like! If she suspected we had the spent the night in each other's room and did what we were doing she would have said something. She would have mentioned it. I can just imagine her now, talking about her responsibilities as a guardian to us and lecturing us…"  
"真嗣，你知道她是什么样的人！如果她怀疑我们在彼此的房间里过夜，做了我们正在做的事，她肯定会说些什么。她会提到的。我都能想象到她现在，谈论她作为我们监护人的责任，然后对我们进行说教……"

"Do you really think she would?"  
"你真的认为她会吗？"

"Are you stupid? Of course she would! She teases us about it but if she knew we were actually doing it she'd flip out. She'd probably get all creepy and try to install cameras or something or have Section 2 spy on us to make sure we weren't doing anything. It creeps me out thinking about it…"  
"你傻吗？当然会！她会拿这事逗我们，但如果她知道我们真的在做，她会发疯的。她可能会变得很诡异，试图安装摄像头什么的，或者让第二课监视我们，确保我们没做任何事。想到这些我就觉得毛骨悚然……"

I smile slightly wondering if Misato would go that far. She seems happy that we had admitted we were boyfriend and girlfriend but if she knew we were sleeping with each other she might have an issue with it.  
我微微一笑，心想美里会不会真的那么极端。她似乎很高兴我们承认了彼此是男女朋友，但如果她知道我们同床共枕，可能会对此有意见。

"She'd probably try to give us the talk as well, about the risks of becoming pregnant or whatever. Urgh, disgusting."  
“她大概也会试图给我们上一课，关于怀孕的风险之类的。呃，真恶心。”

I laugh but her words strike a chord with me. I remember my time in that other place and the times we've been together here. I think about how meticulous Asuka is about checking whenever we finish making love. How she double checks for anything that could have gone wrong. When I was trapped in the Angel I asked her about it and she said that she couldn't risk falling pregnant there, not with only two of us. She said we were still too young to think about that sort of thing anyway.  
我笑了，但她的话触动了我。我想起了在那个地方的时光，以及我们在这里共度的时刻。我想到了明日香每次做完爱后是如何仔细检查的，她是如何反复确认一切可能出错的地方。当我被困在使徒中时，我问过她这件事，她说她不能在那里冒险怀孕，毕竟只有我们两个人。她说我们还是太年轻，根本不该考虑那种事。

She asked me once about my thoughts on being a father. I didn't know how to answer her. I had never thought about it. I never expected to love someone the way I do her, I never expected to find someone who loved me. When I started fighting in the Eva I never expected to stay alive and I didn't care about staying alive at some points. When I think about me as a father I can't help but imagine myself as my own father. That cold hearted man who sits behind his desk all day in NERV. The man who I can barely call a father.  
她曾问过我对于成为父亲的看法。我不知如何回答。我从未想过这个问题。我从未料到会如此深爱一个人，也从未想过会找到一个爱我的人。当我开始驾驶 Eva 时，我从未想过能活下来，甚至在某些时刻，我不在乎是否能活下去。当我思考自己作为父亲的角色时，我忍不住将自己想象成我的亲生父亲。那个冷酷无情的人，整天坐在 NERV 的办公桌后。那个我几乎无法称之为父亲的人。

I never asked her about her thoughts on being a mother. I haven't asked her here about her mother. I sometimes hear her utter her mother's name in her sleep. I sometimes hear her cry but all I need to do is hold her and it goes away. There is no need to talk about it now.  
我从未问过她对于成为母亲的看法。我也没有在这里问过她关于她母亲的事。我有时听到她在睡梦中喃喃她母亲的名字。我有时听到她哭泣，但只需我抱住她，一切就消失了。现在没有必要谈论这些。

Yet there might come a time we will have to talk about it. The next Angel will be coming in a matter of weeks. So much has changed from what I saw last time. We have four Evangelion Units to face it with and I presume we have the Lance of Longinus. Asuka doesn't have as much to prove this time so it's likely she won't volunteer to take point. Knowing Asuka she will though and it'll attack her, probing into the darkest corners of her mind. Making her relive her most horrific memories over and over again. I have to stop it.  
然而，总有一天我们不得不谈论这件事。下一个使徒将在几周内到来。与我上次所见相比，变化巨大。我们现在有四台 EVA 机体来应对，并且我推测我们拥有朗基努斯之枪。这次，明日香不需要证明太多，所以她可能不会主动请缨。但了解明日香，她还是会这么做，而使徒将会攻击她，深入她心灵最阴暗的角落。让她一遍又一遍地重温最可怕的记忆。我必须阻止它。

I feel a sharp pain in my ribs as Asukas elbow collides with them, "Ow!"  
明日香的肘部撞到我的肋骨，一阵剧痛袭来，"哎哟！"

"Well then reply to me when I'm talking to you idiot!"  
“那好，你这个白痴，等我跟你说话时再回答我！”

"S-Sorry!" "对-对不起！"

"I really wish you wouldn't do that!"  
"我真的希望你不要那样做！"

"Do what?" "做什么？"

"Go all quiet and solemn and mopey for no reason. You're my boyfriend, you should be proud and honoured to be able to walk in public with an elite pilot such as myself. You should have your head held up high and you should be firmly grasping my hand as we walk past all these other lowly people who are in awe of us."  
"无缘无故就变得沉默、严肃和忧郁。你是我的男朋友，能和我这样一位精英飞行员一起在公共场合行走，你应该感到自豪和荣幸。你应该昂首挺胸，坚定地握住我的手，当我们走过那些对我们充满敬畏的普通人时。"

She doesn't grab my hand, instead she links her arm around mine and pulls me towards her. Without giving me any time to react she kisses me on the cheek. It's hard to not smile at her and her antics put those thoughts out of my mind.  
她没有握住我的手，而是将手臂环在我的臂弯里，拉我靠近她。没给我任何反应的时间，她在我脸颊上亲了一下。很难不对她微笑，她的这些小动作让我暂时忘却了那些思绪。

"So… what's bugging you now Third?"  
“那么……现在是什么事情让你烦恼呢，第三？”

"N-Nothing… I was just… wondering when we won't have to fight anymore… when people will come back to the city..."  
“没、没什么……我只是……在想我们什么时候才能不再战斗……人们什么时候才能回到城市……”

"Is that it? We fight until the Angel's stop coming, people come back when they realize they have nothing to be afraid of. It's simple."  
"就这样吗？我们一直战斗到使徒不再出现，人们意识到没有什么可害怕的就会回来。很简单。"

I smile and nod knowing the truth, it isn't that simple. We still have a way to go.  
我微笑着点头，心里明白，事情并没有那么简单。我们还有一段路要走。

---

My heart leaps into my throat at the sound of the sirens, I look around the class room and I see Asuka, Kaworu, Rei and Touji all exchange glances. This wasn't supposed to happen yet, the next Angel isn't supposed to be here so why? Why are the sirens sounding? Why is Asuka answering her phone? Why are the few who remained behind standing up and evacuating the classroom?  
听到警报声，我的心跳到了嗓子眼，我环顾教室，看到明日香、渚薰、绫波和东治都交换了一下眼神。这还不该发生，下一个使徒不应该在这里，为什么？为什么警报会响起？为什么明日香在接电话？为什么剩下的人站起来撤离教室？

I jump as I feel someone place their hand on my shoulder, I spin around and find myself looking into Kaworu's eyes.  
我吓了一跳，感觉有人把手放在我的肩膀上，我转过身来，发现自己正对上渚薰的眼睛。

"Well, this is unexpected isn't it Shinji?"  
“嗯，这真是意料之外，不是吗，真嗣？”

His voice is calm, how can he be calm in a situation like this? Of course, he doesn't know what I know. He just thinks this is a regular Angel attack.  
他的声音平静，他怎么能在这情况下还如此镇定？当然，他不知道我所知道的。他只认为这是一次普通的使徒袭击。

"Well what are you guys waiting for? Stop slacking!"  
“你们还在等什么？别偷懒了！”

I give no reply to Kaworu but I can feel him watching me as I leave the classroom just behind Asuka. I have to calm down and think, but I don't have the time.  
我没有回答渚，但能感觉到他跟在我身后离开教室，就在明日香后面。我必须冷静下来思考，但我没有时间。

---

The scent of the LCL feels stronger today, maybe it's just my nerves but it smells even more like blood than usual. I close my eyes and let it pass over me. On opening them I bring up the displays inside the plug. To my left is Asuka's, an expression of pure determination on her face. She's wearing a confident smile. To the right is Kaworu, he's also smiling but it's the same expression he always has. I can't tell if he is scared or confident.  
今天的 LCL 气味似乎更浓了，也许是我的神经作祟，它闻起来比平时更像血。我闭上眼睛，任其掠过我。睁开眼时，我调出了插入栓内的显示屏。左边是明日香的，她脸上带着纯粹的决心，自信地微笑着。右边是渚，他也微笑着，但那表情一如既往。我无法判断他是害怕还是自信。

We're going to have three Evangelions for this Angel. Touji's Evangelion was destroyed, he isn't really in any condition to fight but they have him here anyway just in case. Rei is in her Eva but it is on standby.  
这次我们要用三台 EVA 对付使徒。东治的 EVA 被毁了，他其实并不适合战斗，但他们还是把他带上了，以防万一。绫波在她的 EVA 里，但处于待命状态。

_"Ok listen up you three. The Angel is currently sat in orbit and doesn't look like it's going to be coming down anytime soon. We're going to send the three of you up there. Asuka you have the highest sync rate so we're going to give you a high-powered rifle. It's a prototype so be careful with it."  
“好了，你们三个听好了。使徒目前停留在轨道上，看起来短时间内不会下来。我们要派你们三个上去。明日香，你的同步率最高，所以我们给你配备了一把高能步枪。这是原型机，小心使用。”_

_"Yeah yeah whatever…" “是是是，随便吧……”_

_"You need to take this seriously Asuka, we don't know how many opportunities we'll get here. We'll be placing you on point, just aim and shoot as we've practiced before okay?"  
"你得认真对待这件事，明日香，我们不知道这里还有多少机会。我们会让你打头阵，就像我们之前练习的那样，瞄准射击，好吗？"_

_"Sure…" "当然…"_

_"Shinji and Kaworu, you'll be providing back-up in case something goes wrong. We've seen from the past few Angels these things don't exactly play fair."  
"真嗣和薰，你们负责支援，以防万一出了什么差错。从过去几只使徒的表现来看，这些东西可不怎么公平。"_

_"Of course." "当然可以。"_

"Right…" “好吧……”

I want to say something and protest but before I get the chance to I feel the lift clamp around the base of the Evangelion and I'm forced back into the seat as the Eva shoots upwards. A few seconds later it comes to a sudden stop and I see the familiar skyline of Tokyo-3, some of its buildings still retracting and a number of our weapon caches rise out of the ground.  
我想说些什么并抗议，但还没等我有机会，升降机就夹住了 EVA 的底部，我被迫向后坐下，EVA 迅速上升。几秒钟后，它突然停下，我看到了熟悉的第三新东京市的天际线，一些建筑仍在收回，我们的武器库也从地面升起。

In the distance I can see Unit 02 standing on a hill, next to it is a large and open weapon locker. She has already grabbed the rifle out of it and is beginning to set it up. She raises the rifle and aims it towards the Angel.  
远处，我看到 02 号机站在一座小山上，旁边是一个大型开放式武器柜。她已经从中取出了步枪，并开始组装。她举起步枪，瞄准了使徒。

I watch, maybe this time will be different, maybe it won't hit her. I hold my breath as I watch, the shot comes out of the rifles end. No one moves as we wait for confirmation on whether or not the shot missed.  
我注视着，或许这次会有所不同，或许她不会被击中。我屏住呼吸，目睹着子弹从枪口射出。我们静止不动，等待着确认子弹是否偏离目标。

Moments later it comes, _"Asuka you missed! No change in the Angels position, we're recalculating the position for you to aim. Get the rifle reloaded."_  
片刻后，消息传来，“明日香，你失手了！使徒的位置没有变化，我们正在重新计算瞄准点。快把枪重新装填。”

_"Right." "对。"_

Unit 02 moves forward and begins to reload the rifle. Almost immediately afterwards I hear Misato again.  
二号机前进并开始重新装填步枪。几乎紧接着，我又听到了美里的话。

"We're getting a change in the Angel! Look out!"  
“天使要变了！小心！”

It's too late, I see the flash of light shine down as the clouds part. A white hot pain suddenly shoots through my head as I'm completely blinded. It's selected me! I'm the one being attacked by it. I thrash at the controls and scream out in agony. This pain is like nothing I've ever felt before. It's like a burning deep within my brain, deep within my mind. I can see the Angels presence there. I grip the controls of my Eva tightly and try to will it to move but it's no use. I can't move, I can't see and I'm in so much pain.  
太迟了，我看到光芒穿透云层闪耀而下。一阵炽热的剧痛突然贯穿我的头部，我完全失明了。它选中了我！我成了被攻击的目标。我猛击控制台，痛苦地尖叫。这种痛苦前所未有，仿佛大脑深处、意识深处被烈火焚烧。我能感受到天使的存在。我紧握 Eva 的操纵杆，试图驱动它，但无济于事。我动弹不得，看不见，痛苦万分。

I release the controls and instinctively bring my hands to my head, I scream out in pain.  
我松开控制杆，本能地双手抱头，痛苦地尖叫。

"Help me! Help me!" “救救我！救救我！”

I don't know if anyone can hear me, I can't hear anyone else. All I have with me is the pain of the Angels attack. I grip the controls again and thrash wildly trying to focus on anything but letting the Angel into my mind.  
我不知道是否有人能听到我的声音，我听不到其他任何人的声音。我身边只有使徒攻击带来的痛苦。我再次紧握操纵杆，疯狂地挣扎，试图专注于任何不让使徒侵入我心灵的事物。

My eyes shut as the pain gets more and more intense. It's beginning to spread from my head throughout the rest of my body. My stomach lurches and I feel like I'm about to be sick when suddenly the pain stops. I open my eyes and I find myself looking around in complete darkness.  
随着疼痛越来越剧烈，我的眼睛闭上了。它开始从头部蔓延到我身体的其他部位。我的胃一阵翻腾，感觉自己快要吐了，突然间疼痛停止了。我睁开眼睛，发现自己正身处一片完全的黑暗之中。

Suddenly there is a loud noise, a bright light shines down a few feet in front of me. My eyes widen with horror as I see what it has illuminated. A hospital bed, a figure laid inside it hooked up to a machine. My stomach drops when I see the person stood next to it. It's me, I'm looking down at the figure. I can hear my own voice.  
突然间，一声巨响传来，一道强光在我前方几英尺处照下。我惊恐地睁大眼睛，看到了被照亮的东西。一张医院病床，上面躺着一个人，连接着一台机器。当我看到站在床边的人时，我的心沉了下去。那是我，我正低头看着那个人。我能听到自己的声音。

"Help me… help me Asuka…"  
“救救我……救救我，明日香……”

I step forward, "No! That isn't… that's not… I don't want to remember that!"  
我向前迈了一步，“不！那不是……那不是……我不想记起那个！”

Another loud noise, the light illuminating the hospital bed has gone. Now a new light shines down near to me. This time I see myself kneeling down, I'm holding someone. It's Rei, above me is the giant hand of Evangelion Unit 01. This is the day I arrived in Tokyo-3. I look on as I seem to be mumbling someone before this version screams out.  
又一声巨响，照亮病床的灯光熄灭了。现在，一束新的光线照在我附近。这次我看到自己跪在地上，正抱着某人。是丽，在我上方是初号机巨大的手掌。这一天，我来到了第三新东京市。我看着自己似乎在喃喃自语，随后这个我尖叫起来。

"I mustn't run away." “我不能逃跑。”

The light fades away again. Almost immediately afterwards there is another noise. Behind me is a new scene. It's the apartment, Asuka is in front of me. She's pinching my nose and kissing me. I swallow at this memory. I watch as I push her away to catch my breath. This time I can see the look of disappointment in her eyes, I can see the sadness on her face and I can see the tears forming just before she runs away.  
光线再次消退。几乎紧接着又是一阵噪音。我身后出现了新的场景。是公寓，明日香在我面前。她正捏着我的鼻子亲吻我。我咽下这份记忆。我看着自己推开她以喘口气。这次我能看到她眼中的失望，脸上的悲伤，以及在她跑开前泪水即将涌出的瞬间。

I know it's useless, I know she can't hear me, "No Asuka! I didn't… I didn't mean to do that!"  
我知道这是徒劳，我知道她听不见，“不，明日香！我不是……我不是故意那么做的！”

A flash, another scene is illuminated. This time it's somewhere I barely recognize. It's a control room. I look ahead and there is a little kid standing at the window. It's me. I turn my head and I see him, my father sat there in his familiar pose. He looks a lot younger and happier, there is a life in his eyes and face that isn't present anymore.  
一道闪光，又一幕场景被照亮。这次是我几乎认不出的地方。这是一间控制室。我向前看去，一个小孩子站在窗前。那是我自己。我转过头，看到了他，我的父亲坐在那里，保持着他熟悉的姿态。他看起来年轻许多，也更快乐，眼中和脸上洋溢着久违的生机。

Standing in front of him, near to my younger self is another man in a lab coat. It's Fuyutsuki, he looks slightly younger as well but he's wearing a frown. Of course he is, I know what this is now. This is the contact experiment. I've seen this before, I was only a kid when it happened and something… something happened. I blocked it out of my mind for the longest time but this was the last time I ever saw my mother.  
站在他面前，靠近年幼的我的，是另一个穿着白大褂的男人。那是福音津，他也显得稍微年轻一些，但眉头紧锁。当然，我现在明白了，这是接触实验。我以前见过这一幕，那时我还只是个孩子，发生了一些事……一些事。我长时间地将它从记忆中抹去，但这是最后一次我见到我的母亲。

I feel sick but I can't keep my eyes off of the form of Unit 01 through the glass. It barely resembles the beast I pilot now but I can see the foundations of it. I can hear voices around me, I think its Fuyutsuki telling my parents off for bringing me here. I'm giggling at something, my hand hitting the glass. My father smiles and waves him off and then I'm sure my mother says something about me witnessing the future of humanity.  
我感觉恶心，但目光却无法从玻璃后 01 号机体的形态上移开。它与我如今驾驶的野兽几乎无法相认，但我能看到它的基础。我听到周围的声音，我想是冬月在责备我的父母带我来这里。我在笑，手拍打着玻璃。父亲微笑着挥手让他离开，然后我确信母亲说了些什么关于我见证人类未来的话。

It begins. It takes barely five seconds for it to happen. I hear the shouts and screams from those around me. I hear the sirens and I see the people rushing around. I see my mother vanish. Why am I being shown these things? Why am I being forced to relive these memories?  
开始了。这一切只用了不到五秒钟。我听到周围人的呼喊和尖叫。我听到警报声，看到人们四处奔忙。我看到母亲消失。为什么我要被展示这些？为什么我要被迫重温这些记忆？

"Mother…" “妈妈…”

There's a sound, like a drop of water falling into a puddle. The scene vanishes and I stagger backwards. I just want it to be over already. A loud thud sounds again, I see the first scene again. Me stood by Asuka's bedside.  
有一种声音，就像一滴水落入水坑。场景消失了，我踉跄后退。我只希望这一切已经结束。又是一声巨响，我又看到了第一个场景。我站在明日香的床边。

"Help me Asuka…" “救救我，明日香……”

I hear me say the words again. This time it lasts longer, I watch as my other self now leans over the bed. Why is this happening? This didn't happen.  
我又听到自己说这些话。这次持续得更久，我看着另一个自己现在俯身在床边。为什么会发生这种事？这并没有发生过。

"Please… help me…" "请…帮帮我…"

He begins to shake at Asuka, only slightly at first. His voice getting louder as he does. I try to call out to him to stop it.  
他开始对着明日香颤抖，起初只是轻微的。随着他的声音越来越大，我试图呼喊让他停下来。

"No! Please don't… stop it!"  
"不！请不要…停下来！"

He can't hear me, he yells one more time and I watch as the bedsheets fly back. Asuka's body is exposed to him. My mouth goes completely dry as I watch him take a step backwards in shock. Slowly his hand moves downwards.  
他听不见我的声音，他又大喊一声，我看着床单飞起。明日香的身躯暴露在他眼前。我目瞪口呆地看着他震惊地后退一步。慢慢地，他的手向下移动。

"NO!"

I drop to my knees as the scene is darkened. The light shines again on the next scene. I'm there again holding Ayanami in my arms. The hand of Unit 01 covering us. I can see the look of shock on Misato and Ritsukos face. I can see the grin on my father's face. I can hear me cry out again.  
我跪倒在地，场景变得昏暗。灯光再次照亮下一个场景。我又一次抱着绫波零。零号机的手覆盖着我们。我能看到美里和律子脸上的震惊。我能看到父亲脸上的笑容。我再次听到自己的呼喊。

"I mustn't run away!" “我不能逃避！”

The Shinji here looks up at his father, "Fine… I'll do it!"  
这里的真嗣抬头看着他的父亲，"好吧……我去做！"

The light drops again. I'm viewing the apartment again, I'm watching the kiss again. I'm watching me pull away again. I'm seeing Asuka tear up and run away as I stand there with a blank expression on my face.  
光线再次下降。我又看到了那个公寓，我又目睹了那个吻。我又看到了自己再次抽身离去。我看到明日香泪流满面地跑开，而我站在那里，脸上毫无表情。

It's useless but I cry out, "Go after her! Help her… just… hold her…"  
这毫无用处，但我还是哭喊出来，"去追她！帮帮她……就……抱抱她……"

I know he won't, I know he can't hear me because this is what I've done. These are my memories. All I can do is watch them. I can't change any of it, I can't change what I've done. I hit the cold floor in frustration as I'm greeted by the sight of the control room again. My younger self. My father. Fuyutsuki. My mother. She vanishes. I swallow and feel tears burning at my eyes.  
我知道他不会，我知道他听不见我，因为这是我所做的。这些都是我的记忆。我只能看着它们。我无法改变任何事，无法改变我所做的。我因沮丧而重重地摔在冰冷的地板上，再次看到控制室的景象。年轻的我。我的父亲。冬月。我的母亲。她消失了。我咽了咽口水，感到泪水在眼眶中燃烧。

It takes no time at all for the cycle to reset. The hospital scene. The sheets being pulled off of Asuka. My other self is reaching down and beginning to degrade her. I can hear the deep breathing and see the movement of his hand.  
循环重置得毫不费时。医院场景。被单从明日香身上扯下。另一个我在俯身开始羞辱她。我能听到沉重的呼吸声，看到他的手动。

"Stop this! Stop this! Stop this! This isn't… this wasn't me! IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!"  
“住手！住手！住手！这不是……这不是我！这没有发生！”

_'This is you!' '这就是你！'_

The words flash through my mind, I don't hear them but I see them. Pure white text on a black background.  
这些词在我脑海中闪过，我并未听见，但我看见了。纯白色的文字映在黑色背景上。

I respond to it. 我回应了它。

"No! This… this isn't!" “不！这…这不是！”

The hospital room fades away. Once again I see me cradling Ayanami in my arms. I'm looking up at my father.  
医院病房渐渐消失。我又一次看到自己怀抱着绫波。我抬头望着父亲。

_'You mustn't run away?' “你不该逃避吗？”_

Again the words flash through my mind.  
那些话语再次闪过我的脑海。

"No… I can't run away!"  
“不……我不能逃跑！”

_"Why?" "为什么？"_

"Because… if I do they'll hate me. My father will hate me! Misato will hate me! Asuka will hate me! I'll be alone!"  
“因为……如果我这么做，他们会恨我。父亲会恨我！美里会恨我！明日香会恨我！我会孤身一人！”

_"So why are you running away now?"  
"那你现在为什么要逃跑？"_

"Huh?" “啊？”

It doesn't respond. Instead the image fades away again. The apartment again, Asuka kissing me and me pulling away and failing to do anything.  
它没有回应。相反，影像再次消散。又是那间公寓，明日香吻我，而我退缩，什么也做不了。

_"You failed her." "你辜负了她。"_

The words again. Is the Angel trying to talk to me?  
那些话语再次出现。是天使在试图与我对话吗？

"Yes… I failed her..." “是的……我辜负了她……”

_"She hurt you." "“她伤害了你。””_

"Yes… she did, she made it seem like a game. I… didn't know what to do but I…"  
"是的……她确实，她让它看起来像一场游戏。我……不知道该怎么办，但我……"

_"You hurt her." "你伤害了她。"_

I nod, "Yes but… I won't let that happen again."  
我点头，"是的，但……我不会再让那种事发生了。"

_"You abandoned her." "你抛弃了她。"_

"No… I… I'm there for her now…"  
"不……我……我现在陪着她……"

There is no reply and once again it fades out. It shows me the control room again. I watch as my mother vanishes but the voice doesn't sound this time. Instead I see something I don't remember seeing before. I see my father stand up. He looks in my direction, not towards the kid version of me but actually towards me. Can he see me?  
没有回应，一切再次淡出。画面再次切换到控制室。我看着母亲消失，但这次没有声音响起。取而代之的是，我看到了之前未曾注意的一幕。我看到父亲站了起来。他朝我的方向看去，不是看向孩童时期的我，而是真的在看我。他能看见我吗？

"F-Father?" "爸——爸爸？"

Suddenly in front of me I feel everything shift. He changes before my eyes, he's no longer in the lab coat but the uniform her wore as the Commander of NERV. He looks older and weary. He isn't wearing his glasses and I can see his eyes.  
突然间，我感到眼前的一切都发生了变化。他就在我眼前转变，不再是那件实验室外套，而是他作为 NERV 指挥官时穿的制服。他看起来更老，也更疲惫。他没有戴眼镜，我可以看到他的眼睛。

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

I can barely speak, all I can do is stutter out the word again.  
我几乎说不出话来，只能再次结结巴巴地吐出那个词。

"F-Father?" "爸-爸爸？"

"You mustn't run away anymore Shinji."  
"你不能再逃避了，真嗣。"

I… what is this? Him giving me advice? What right does he have to give me advice or say something like that? After what he did and is doing? I want to yell but I can't bring myself to, I remind myself this isn't real. I'm not here.  
我……这是什么？他给我建议？他有什么资格给我建议或说那样的话？在他做了那些事之后？我想大喊，但我无法让自己这么做，我提醒自己这不是真的。我不在这里。

"You mustn't repeat my mistakes. I thought I would be able to undo your mother's death. I thought I could bring her back to us. I was wrong. We are unable to change the past, all we can do is move towards the future, no matter what happens."  
"你绝不能重蹈我的覆辙。我曾以为我能挽回你母亲的死。我以为我能让她回到我们身边。我错了。我们无法改变过去，我们能做的就是迈向未来，无论发生什么。"

"I… I know that! I don't want to change the past. I am moving forward! You…"  
"我……我知道！我不想改变过去。我在向前走！你……"

In an instant he is gone and another word flashes through my mind.  
一瞬间他消失了，另一个词闪过我的脑海。

_"Liar." "骗子。"_

I'm in complete darkness again. My father is gone, all the different scenes around me are gone. All I have is that word cycling through my mind.  
我又陷入了彻底的黑暗。父亲已经离去，周围各种场景也都消失了。我脑海中不断回旋的，只剩下那个词。

_"Liar." "骗子。"_

A new scene unfolds before me, an empty deserted road. I can see my younger self stood there again. He's crying and I see in the distance the form of a man walking away. This was the day he abandoned me. The day he left me here on my own waiting for person who would become my teacher to come and pick me up.  
眼前展开一幅新景象，一条空旷荒凉的道路。我看见年轻的自己再次站在那里。他在哭泣，远处有一个男人的身影渐行渐远。那一天，他抛弃了我。那一天，他让我独自留在这里，等待将成为我老师的人来接我。

That man was the only one who would take me in. I had no other family who was willing to do so. They all had a mistrust of my father from day one, and when my mother died they wanted nothing to do with him or with me. My father sought out a teacher in a local school. He adopted me, he cared for me. He gave me my Cello and taught me how to play and he tried his best.  
那个男人是唯一愿意收留我的人。我没有其他家人愿意这么做。他们从一开始就对我父亲心存疑虑，母亲去世后，他们更不想与他或我有任何瓜葛。父亲在当地学校找到了一位老师。他收养了我，照顾我。他给了我大提琴，教我如何演奏，他尽其所能。

I wasn't a very good child. I rarely smiled and I rarely cried. I had no friends to speak of. People tried but after the first time I'd push them away they wouldn't bother anymore. The hedgehog's dilemma as it was once described to me. I wanted friends and I wanted family. Yet I never felt I deserved it so I pushed people away when they attempted it. They never tried again and I just saw that as them never caring in the first place.  
我并不是一个好孩子。我很少笑，也很少哭。我没有朋友可言。人们尝试过接近我，但第一次被我推开后，他们就不再费心了。这就是所谓的刺猬困境，有人曾这样向我描述过。我渴望朋友，渴望家庭。然而，我总觉得自己不配拥有这些，所以当人们试图亲近时，我会推开他们。他们再也没有尝试过，而我则认为他们从一开始就不曾真正关心过。

Misato was the first one to break through. She didn't give up on me, when I pushed her away she came for me. She shown me she cared. Touji and Kensuke never gave up on me. Ayanami didn't give up on me and Asuka… we both suffered from it and we tried to push each other away just to see how far the other would go. We never gave up on each other though.  
美里是第一个突破这层障碍的人。她没有放弃我，即使我推开她，她依然来找我。她让我看到了她的关心。真治和健介从未放弃过我。绫波也没有放弃我，而明日香……我们俩都深受其苦，试图推开对方，只是想看看对方能走多远。尽管如此，我们从未真正放弃过彼此。

_"Liar." "骗子。"_

The word flashes through my mind again.  
这个词再次闪过我的脑海。

_"You did give up on her."  
"你确实放弃了她。"_

I reply, "No, I never gave up on Asuka! I always… always…"  
我回答道，"不，我从未放弃过明日香！我一直……一直……"

_"You abandoned her, remember?"  
"你抛弃了她，记得吗？"_

A flash and the road is gone. I'm back in Evangelion Unit 01 but the scene before me is the ruins of Tokyo 3. I can't close my eyes no matter how much I want to, I know what I'm about to see.  
一道闪光过后，道路消失了。我回到了初号机里，但眼前的景象却是第三新东京市的废墟。无论我多么想闭上眼睛，我知道即将看到什么。

"No…"

It comes into view. 它映入眼帘。

"No…"

I see the tattered remains of Unit 02. The lances that pierce it. The twitching of the humanoid corpse inside. Its armour splattered and the nine white Units around it looking towards me. Each one wearing what looks like a sadistic grin, their mouths stained with the blood of the Evangelion.  
我看到了零二机残破的遗骸。那些贯穿它的长矛。内部人形尸体的抽搐。它的装甲四溅，周围九台白色机体齐齐望向我。每一台都带着仿佛施虐般的狞笑，嘴角沾满了使徒的鲜血。

I start to scream. 我开始尖叫。

"This isn't… No… I don't want to remember this! I don't want to see this! Stop it! STOP IT!"  
"这不是…不…我不想记起这些！我不想看到这些！停下来！停下！"

Another instant and the scene is gone and I'm back in the darkness. I continue to scream out and all of a sudden the lights start up again. Each scene is illuminated one by one, all I hear is a phrase or a sentence. Each time getting louder and louder.  
转眼间，那场景消失了，我又回到了黑暗中。我继续尖叫，突然间灯光再次亮起。每一幕场景逐一被照亮，我听到的只有一句话或一个短语。每次都越来越响。

_"Help me Asuka." “帮帮我，明日香。”_

_"I mustn't run away." “我不能逃跑。”_

_"I can't believe I let you kiss me."  
"真不敢相信我让你吻了我。"_

_"Today he'll witness history."  
"今天，他将见证历史。"_

_"Help me Asuka." “帮帮我，明日香。”_

_"I mustn't run away." “我不能逃跑。”_

_"I can't believe I let you kiss me."  
"真不敢相信我让你吻了我。"_

_"Today he'll witness the future of mankind."  
"今天，他将见证人类的未来。"_

The scenes spin around me, making me go dizzy as I try to cover my ears. All that happens is the words get louder and bore into my mind.  
场景在我周围旋转，让我头晕目眩，我试图捂住耳朵。结果只是那些话语变得更响亮，深深钻入我的脑海。

_"Help me Asuka." “帮帮我，明日香。”_

_"I mustn't run away." “我不能逃跑。”_

_"I can't believe I let you kiss me."  
“我真不敢相信我让你吻了我。”_

_"Today he'll witness the future of mankind."  
“今天，他将见证人类的未来。”_

I scream out, "NO! STOP IT, STOP MAKING ME REMEMBER ALL OF THIS!"  
我尖叫道，“不！停下来，别再让我记起这一切！”

_"I'm so fucked up." “我真是糟糕透顶。”_

_"Fine I'll do it." “好吧，我做就是了。”_

_"I can't believe I let you kiss me."  
"真不敢相信我让你吻了我。"_

_"She's gone, we've lost her."  
"她走了，我们失去了她。"_

"PLEASE JUST STOP! I DON'T WANT THIS!"  
"请住手！我不想要这样！"

As I scream trying to drown out the sound of the words they all merge into one sound. They reach a crescendo before coming to an end. The words are gone and I'm left with the sound of crashing waves. Now I'm staring out at something new. A beach and its night time. In the sky I can see the moon with a streak of red across it. In the sea I can make out the giant head of Lilith.  
当我尖叫着试图淹没那些话语的声音时，它们全都融合成了一种声响。它们达到高潮后逐渐消逝。话语消失了，我只剩下海浪拍击的声音。现在我凝视着一片新景象。一片海滩及其夜色。天空中，我看到月亮上有一道红色的痕迹。在海中，我能辨认出莉莉丝巨大的头颅。

I know this place as well. This is where we awoke in that false world. It's another memory, and as I look ahead I can see my form kneeling over on top of something. I subconsciously bring my own hands up to my throat as I realize what this is. I was choking her, I got on top of her and tried to kill her. I step back and I feel sick yet I can't keep my eyes off of it. I watch for it, the moment she raises her hand to caress my cheek. I can feel myself start to cry as I know that Shinji there is.  
我熟悉这个地方。这是我们在那个虚假世界中醒来的地方。这是另一个记忆，当我向前看时，我可以看到自己的身影跪在某物之上。我下意识地抬起自己的手放在喉咙上，意识到这是什么。我曾试图掐死她，我压在她身上试图杀死她。我后退一步，感到恶心，却无法移开视线。我注视着，等待她抬起手来轻抚我的脸颊的那一刻。我知道那里的真嗣，我开始哭泣。

Eventually I watch as I finally collapse on top of her. I watch as she gently puts her arms around my and lets me sleep.  
最终，我看着自己终于在她身上崩溃。我看着她温柔地用双臂环绕着我，让我入睡。

There is a flash and it looks like this is a few hours later. I'm still stood on the beach but now it's changed. I'm sat up and clutching a bottle of water and something in my hand. I can hear our conversation from here.  
画面一闪，时间似乎已过去几个小时。我依旧站在海滩上，但景象已然不同。我坐起身来，紧握着一瓶水和手中的某样东西。我能听到我们此处的对话。

_"Hey Asuka…" "嘿，明日香…"_

_"Mmm hmm…" "嗯哼…"_

_"I think… I'll be alright if you want to get some rest."  
"我想…如果你想要休息一下，我会没事的。"_

_"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"_

_"Yeah…" “嗯……”_

I can't help but smile as I start to take the small blanket off of myself and hand it to her. She shakes her head and tells me sternly that I have to stay warm.  
我不禁微笑，开始解下身上的小毯子递给她。她摇摇头，严肃地告诉我必须保持温暖。

_"__If you feel ill at all wake me okay. I'll just rest my eyes for a bit."_  
“如果你感到任何不适，就叫醒我，好吗？我只想闭眼休息一会儿。”

My smile grows wider as she takes some of the blanket and snuggles up next to me and falls asleep almost instantly.  
她扯过一些毯子，紧贴着我蜷缩起来，几乎立刻就睡着了，我的笑容也因此愈发灿烂。

There is another flash and I'm in that small apartment that was there. I can see myself sat on the couch in there and I'm watching as Asuka enters wearing the dressing gown  
又是一道闪光，我回到了那个小公寓。我看见自己坐在那里的沙发上，目睹着明日香穿着浴袍走进来。

_"__A-A-Asuka…"_ “明…明日香…”

_"__I need you to do something Shinji…"_  
"真嗣，我需要你做件事……"

_"__Is everything alright?"_ "一切都还好吗？"

Asuka begins to untie the cord of the gown.  
明日香开始解开浴袍的系带。

_"__I need you to do something Shinji…"_  
"真嗣，我需要你做件事……"

The robe falls to the ground, unlike the Shinji sitting on the couch I don't turn my head away. Instead I see all of Asuka from behind as the robe falls around her feet. I hear her name stammered out and her cold reply. I remember this as well. I listen to the conversation and sadness pulls at my heart. This was what she became in that world. She felt she had to do this.  
长袍滑落在地，与坐在沙发上的真嗣不同，我没有别过头去。相反，我看到了长袍落在她脚边的明日香的全貌。我听到她结巴地念出她的名字，以及她冰冷的回应。这一幕我也记得。我听着他们的对话，悲伤牵动着我的心。这就是她在那个世界变成的样子。她觉得她必须这么做。

Her pleading with me to tell her that she was still her. This was the first time she broken down in front of me. The first time the wall in front of Asuka crumbled to the ground and she let me see who or at least what she thought she was.  
她恳求我告诉她，她还是原来的她。这是她第一次在我面前崩溃。明日香面前的墙第一次倒塌，她让我看到了她是谁，或者至少是她认为自己是什么样的人。

It was the first time I confessed that I loved her.  
那是我第一次向她坦白，我爱她。

What is the point of this? Why am I being shown these things?  
这有什么意义？为什么我要看到这些？

_'__Because you're running away!'_  
'因为你正在逃避！'

"Running away from what?"  
“逃避什么？”

_'__Reality'_ '现实'

_"__NO! I'm not! I'm not running away! I'M NOT!"_  
"不！我没有！我没有逃跑！我没有！"

I yell out again as the apartment changes back to the previous darkness. I close my eyes and all the noise suddenly stops. Is it over? I open my eyes slowly and I'm no longer in the darkness. Instead I'm on the beach again, in the distance I can see the sinking head of Lilith. There is a gentle breeze as the red waves lap against the shore. I can see a figure on the beach. I strain my eyes to make her out. The red hair swaying in the breeze, a yellow dress… Asuka?  
我再次大喊，公寓变回了之前的黑暗。我闭上眼睛，所有的噪音突然停止了。结束了吗？我慢慢睁开眼睛，不再身处黑暗中。相反，我又回到了海滩上，远处可以看到莉莉丝沉没的头。微风轻拂，红色的波浪轻拍着海岸。我看到海滩上有一个人影。我努力辨认她的样子。红色的头发在风中摇曳，黄色的裙子……明日香？

She turns around just as it's her. She looks directly at me and her eyes widen with shock.  
她转过身来，正是她。她直视着我，眼中流露出震惊的神色。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

I step forward not sure what to say, is it really her or just another trick of the Angel.  
我向前迈了一步，不确定该说什么，这真的是她，还是天使的又一个把戏？

"It's… really you?" “真的是你吗？”

I nod slowly, my mouth dropping open. She walks towards me, a smile on her face at sight of me. As she approaches I see the redness around her eyes. Has she been crying?  
我缓缓点头，嘴巴不由自主地张开。她朝我走来，看到我时脸上露出了微笑。当她走近时，我注意到她眼周的红晕。她哭过了吗？

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

She launches herself at me embracing me tightly. I stumble backwards but quickly catch my balance and put my arms around her. I feel tears running down my face but I don't mind. I don't mind Asuka seeing me like this. She pulls away slightly and I feel her thumb run over my face wiping away the tears. She gives me a sweet little smile.  
她猛地扑向我，紧紧地拥抱着。我踉跄后退，但很快稳住了身形，也伸出双臂抱住她。我感到泪水顺着脸颊滑落，但我并不介意。我不介意明日香看到我这副模样。她稍稍退开，我感觉到她的拇指轻抚过我的脸颊，拭去泪水。她给了我一个甜美的微笑。

"Shinji… I was, we were so worried… we thought we had lost you!"  
“真嗣……我，我们真的很担心……我们以为已经失去你了！”

"Asuka what… what happened?"  
"明日香，这…这是怎么了？"

She steps away and eyes me curiously but there is a sympathetic look in her eyes. I don't understand what is going on. Why am I on this beach? Why is the sea red? Why is Lilith there?  
她退后一步，好奇地打量着我，但眼中流露出一丝同情。我不明白发生了什么。为什么我会在这片海滩上？为什么大海是红色的？为什么莉莉丝在那里？

"Y-You don't remember?" "你…你不记得了吗？"

I shake my head, "I was… attacked… and…"  
我摇摇头，“我被…袭击了…而且…”

She nods, "Yeah… you came to find me… you… Misato and Rebecca. You found me in the apartment and someone… someone shot you."  
她点点头，“是啊…你来找我…你和美里还有丽贝卡。你们在我公寓里找到了我，然后有人…有人朝你开了枪。”

I feel my stomach drop yet another time. I feel a cold chill shoot through my spine. No, that isn't right. I was in my Eva, I was fighting the Angel. This must be what it is, it's another trick.  
"我感到胃再次下沉。一股寒意穿透脊梁。不，不对。我应该在我的 Eva 里，我在与使徒战斗。这一定是某种伎俩。”

"Shinji, what's wrong?" "真嗣，怎么了？"

I break the embrace and I look at her, "No… that isn't right."  
我挣脱拥抱，看着她，"不……不对劲。"

She looks at me, "Look… you've been hurt for nearly three weeks Shinji this is going to be difficult but… it is what happened. We've got to go."  
她看着我，"听着……你已经受伤近三周了，真嗣，这会很困难，但……事情就是这样。我们得走了。"

She reaches for my hand but I pull away. I try to ignore the look of hurt that has spread across her face as I do so. I know this isn't real though. The Angel is just trying to attack my mind again, it's trying to use what I saw in that false world against me. I know Asuka and the others are really out there. They'll use the Lance to defeat the Angel any moment now and this'll be over.  
她伸手来抓我的手，但我躲开了。我试图忽视她脸上蔓延的受伤表情。我知道这不是真的。天使只是在试图再次攻击我的心灵，它试图利用我在那个虚假世界中看到的来对付我。我知道明日香和其他人真的在外面。他们随时会用长枪击败天使，这一切就会结束。

"No… this isn't real!" “不……这不是真的！”

"Are you stupid? Of course this is real!"  
“你傻吗？这当然是真实的！”

"No! I was in the Eva! This is just that Angel, the one in orbit trying to attack my mind again."  
"不！我在 Eva 里！这只是那个天使，在轨道上的那个，试图再次攻击我的心灵。"

Her eyes change instantly from sympathy to anger.  
她的眼神立刻从同情转变为愤怒。

"Idiot! What are you talking about! That was me that Angel attacked and you know it. You know that Shinji! Come on, we need to get you back to the shelter, you've been through a lot. You shouldn't be up."  
"傻瓜！你在说什么！那是我被那个天使攻击了，你明明知道。你知道的，真嗣！快点，我们需要带你回避难所，你经历了太多。你不应该起来的。"

She reaches for my hand again but this time I push her away and I turn screaming at her.  
她再次伸手来抓我的手，但这次我推开了她，转身对着她尖叫。

"NO! Stop it! Stop it! This isn't real, you're not my Asuka!"  
“不！住手！住手！这不是真的，你不是我的明日香！”

I feel her reach for me, she grabs my collar and spins me around. I watch as her hand reaches back and I brace myself for her slap. Just before she can make contact with me there is a bright flash of light. In an instant she is gone, I feel pain shoot through my body and finally the light subsides. I stare up open mouthed at the sight of Tokyo-3. I can smell the LCL in the Entry Plug. I'm back. I'm home.  
我感觉到她向我伸出手，抓住了我的衣领并把我转了过来。我看着她的手向后缩，准备迎接她的耳光。就在她即将碰到我的那一刻，一道强光闪过。转眼间她消失了，我感到一阵剧痛贯穿全身，最终光芒消退。我张口结舌地望着眼前的第三新东京市。我能闻到插入栓里的 LCL 液体味道。我回来了。我回家了。

---

I sit alone staring out across the skyline of Tokyo-3. I think it was Kaworu who saved me in the end. When I resurfaced I heard Misato confirming the target had been destroyed and congratulating Kaworu on the shot. Now I'm alone, surrounded by hazard tape warning people not to approach me.  
我独自坐着，凝视着东京-3 的天际线。我想最终是渚薰救了我。当我重新浮出水面时，听到美里确认目标已被摧毁，并向渚薰祝贺那一击的成功。现在我孤身一人，被警示带包围，警告人们不要靠近我。

I've already thrown up twice in the hour since I got out of the Eva. Once as soon as I got out and the other shortly after I was sat down here. I can't stop shaking nor can I get the image of Asuka on that beach out of my head. It felt so real, more so than the other illusions the Angel threw at me. I can still remember her hurt face when I told her I knew it was false.  
自从我从 Eva 里出来后，已经吐了两次，一次是刚出来，另一次是坐在这里不久后。我无法停止颤抖，也无法摆脱脑海中明日香在海滩上的影像。那种感觉如此真实，比天使制造的其他幻象更为逼真。我仍记得当我告诉她我知道那是假的时，她受伤的表情。

No one has come to visit me since I was put here. They all got pulled into a debriefing so didn't have the chance to. I wonder if that is still going on. I bring my legs up to my chest and wrap my arms around them tightly. All there is now is a sense of emptiness, confusion and shaking. The team that got me out of the Entry Plug dumped me here and left me. They didn't even get me anything to drink after I had been sick. My father's orders I suspect, get him out and leave him be. We don't know what the Angel might have done to him.  
自从我被安置在这里后，没有人来看望过我。他们都去参加汇报会了，所以没有机会过来。我不知道那汇报会是否还在进行。我把双腿蜷缩到胸前，紧紧抱住它们。现在只剩下空虚、困惑和颤抖的感觉。把我从驾驶舱里救出来的队伍把我丢在这里就离开了。我吐完后他们甚至没给我拿水喝。我猜这是我父亲的命令，把他弄出来，然后别管他。我们不知道天使可能对他做了什么。

I see a shadow suddenly appear near to my position. I turn slowly and to my surprise I see Kaworu stood at the edge of the cordon. He isn't wearing his usual smile, his eyes show concern.  
我看到一个影子突然出现在我的附近。我缓缓转身，惊讶地发现卡罗站在警戒线的边缘。他没有带着平常的微笑，眼中流露出关切。

"K-Kaworu?" “卡-卡罗？”

I slowly make my way to my feet. I stumble but quickly catch myself and take a few deep breaths to help fight the dizziness. Slow but surely I stagger over to him and he holds out a bottle of water.  
我慢慢站起身来。踉跄了一下，但迅速稳住自己，深呼吸几口以对抗眩晕。虽然缓慢但坚定地，我蹒跚着走向他，他递给我一瓶水。

"I thought you might need this. I apologize I didn't come sooner. How are you feeling?"  
"我以为你可能需要这个。很抱歉我没有早点来。你感觉怎么样？"

I smile weakly and take the water from him and gently sip it before sitting back down on the concrete floor.  
我虚弱地笑了笑，从他手中接过水，轻轻啜饮后再次坐回到水泥地上。

"Everything hurts… y-you used the Lance of Longinus didn't you?"  
"全身都疼……你用了朗基努斯之枪，对吧？"

I watch his expression change slightly, he looks a bit shocked at my words and I realize the mistake I have made. No one has told me about the Lance yet, he's probably wondering how I knew. He doesn't question me.  
我观察到他的表情微微变化，他似乎对我的话感到有些震惊，我意识到自己犯了个错误。还没人告诉我关于朗基努斯之枪的事，他大概在想我是怎么知道的。他没有追问我。

"Yes, I used the Lance. Rei acquired it from Terminal Dogma where Lilith dwells and I threw it. Your girlfriend was not pleased that I got to kill the Angel but she was thankful to me for saving your life, she even hugged me."  
“是的，我使用了朗基努斯之枪。丽从莉莉丝所在的最终教条区得到了它，我把它投掷了出去。你的女朋友对没能亲手杀死使徒感到不快，但她还是感激我救了你的命，甚至拥抱了我。”

I laugh. That sounds like Asuka, equal parts concern for me and equal parts concern for her kill ratio. Still it sounds like she cared for me more. I look up at Kaworu.  
我笑了。这很像明日香，既关心我又在意她的击杀记录。不过听起来她更关心我一些。我抬头看向渚薰。

"Thank you… I… I…" "谢谢你……我……我……"

He shushes me, "You do not need to thank me. I'm your friend."  
他轻声安抚我，“你不需要感谢我。我是你的朋友。”

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

Silence falls as Kaworu kneels down next to me, he places a reassuring hand on my shaking leg and smiles.  
沉默降临，渚薰跪在我身边，他将一只令人安心的手放在我颤抖的腿上，微笑着。

"Don't worry Shinji, you'll see her again. This'll be over soon."  
别担心，真嗣，你还会见到她的。这一切很快就会结束。

### Chapter 20 Convergence Level 1
**Day 20 第 20 天**

I look out across the desolate red sea, the remains of Lillith are still present but sinking more and more with each day. A gentle breeze is blowing causing my hair and my yellow dress to sway ever so slightly. Despite the apocalyptic look of the ocean I can smell the sea, I take a deep breath and allow it to fill my lungs as I gaze out. I'm not gazing at anything in particular, I don't even know why I'm here. It's the first time I've been out of the facility in nearly three weeks.  
我眺望着这片荒凉的红海，莉莉丝的遗迹依旧存在，但随着每一天的流逝，它们正逐渐下沉。一阵轻风拂过，使得我的头发和黄色的裙子微微摇曳。尽管海洋呈现出末日般的景象，我仍能闻到海的味道，我深吸一口气，让这气息充满我的肺腑，同时凝视着远方。我并非在凝视某个特定的东西，甚至不知道自己为何会在这里。这是我近三周以来第一次离开设施。

I don't really know why I'm here. I've been struggling to talk to him lately, maybe I was thinking coming here and seeing this would give me something to talk about. This was the place in which we returned. I remember him trying to choke me when we came back, I didn't blame him but it was one gesture from me that stopped him. A simple act of kindness from me that stopped him. The first time I really reached out to him. I lay there and I let him cry, I lay there and I held him.  
我真的不知道自己为何会来这里。最近我一直难以与他交谈，或许我以为来到这里，看到这一切，能找到话题。这是我们归来的地方。我记得我们回来时，他试图掐住我的脖子，我并不怪他，但正是我的一次简单善举阻止了他。我的一次简单善举，让他停下了手。这是我第一次真正向他伸出援手。我躺在那里，任由他哭泣，我躺在那里，紧紧拥抱着他。

I looked after him for those first few days. I made sure he ate something and I made sure he drank something. I promised I'd look after him. That was my purpose in life, he was my reason for being back. I feel the tears in my eyes and I let them fall freely. There is no one here to see them, I don't have to be strong here. This is our place. As morbid and fucked up as it looks this is the place we started to let our walls come down.  
在最初的那几天里，我照顾着他。确保他吃了点东西，喝了点水。我承诺过会照顾他。这就是我生活的目的，他是让我回来的理由。我感到泪水在眼眶中打转，任由它们自由滑落。这里没有人会看到，我不必在这里坚强。这是我们的地方。尽管看起来阴森且糟糕透顶，但这是我们开始卸下心防的地方。

I bring a hand up to wipe the tears away and hear a rustling sound behind me. Someone else is here? I quickly wipe my eyes of any tears and stand up straight before spinning around. My jaw drops open instantly. It's him, he's there in front of me. I don't know how, I don't understand it but Shinji is there.  
我抬起手来擦去泪水，听到身后传来一阵窸窣声。还有其他人在这里？我迅速擦干眼泪，挺直身子，然后转身。我的下巴立刻张开。是他，他就站在我面前。我不知道怎么回事，我不明白，但真嗣就在那里。

My jaw drops slightly and my eyes widen.  
我的下巴微微张开，眼睛瞪大了。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

I call out to him and watch as he steps forward. He looks unstable on his feet. I suppose he would be after being bedbound for nearly three weeks. I call again.  
我呼唤着他，看着他向前迈步。他的脚步显得不稳。我想，在床上躺了近三周后，他应该是这样的。我又喊了一声。

"It's… really you?" “真的是你吗？”

I watch as he nods, his mouth opening ever so slightly. It's like he didn't expect to see me here. He looks shocked but I don't care. Shinji is awake and he is here. I can't help but allow myself to smile as I rush towards him and grab him tightly in my arms. I feel him stumble back but he quickly regains his balance and I feel his arms around me. Those arms I've longed to feel around me for three whole weeks.  
我看着他微微点头，嘴巴微微张开。他似乎没想到会在这里见到我。他看起来很震惊，但我不在乎。真嗣醒了，他就在这里。我忍不住让自己微笑，冲向他，紧紧抱住他。我感觉到他踉跄后退，但很快恢复了平衡，我感觉到他的手臂环绕着我。这三周来，我一直渴望感受到他的拥抱。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

I pull away ever so slightly so I can get a good look at his face. He looks like he has been through hell. He's crying too so I lift my hand up to wipe away his tears. I smile at him.  
我稍稍拉开距离，以便好好看看他的脸。他看起来像是经历了地狱般的折磨。他也在哭泣，于是我抬起手为他擦去泪水。我对他微笑。

"Shinji… I was, we were so worried… we thought we had lost you!"  
“真嗣……我，我们真的很担心……我们以为已经失去你了！”

"Asuka what… what happened?"  
"明日香，这…这是怎么了？"

I step back. He can't remember what happened? Is that… normal? No it must be, Fuyutsuki did say that when Shinji did eventually wake up there might be some memory loss. I guess I'll just have to remind him. I can't help but be concerned that no one told him, he must have come straight here after waking up.  
我后退一步。他不记得发生了什么？这……正常吗？不，一定是的，冬月确实说过，当真嗣最终醒来时，可能会有一些记忆丧失。我想我只能提醒他了。我不禁担心，没人告诉他，他一定是醒来后直接来这里的。

"Y-You don't remember?" "你…你不记得了吗？"

He shakes his head, "I was… attacked… and…"  
他摇摇头，"我……被袭击了……然后……"

"Yeah… you came to find me… you… Misato and Rebecca. You found me in the apartment and someone…"  
“是的……你来找我……你……美里和丽贝卡。你在公寓里找到了我，然后有人……”

I swallow as I recall the next part. It's still something that is so fresh in my mind, the sound of the gunshot and the feel of his blood on my hands.  
我咽了口唾沫，回忆起接下来的部分。那声音，枪响，还有他鲜血在我手上的触感，至今仍历历在目。

"…someone shot you." “……有人朝你开枪了。”

He face suddenly changes at my saying that. He really doesn't remember does he? No, this is something else he looks frightened.  
听到这话，他的脸色突然变了。他真的不记得了吗？不，这是另一回事，他看起来很害怕。

"Shinji, what's wrong?" "真嗣，怎么了？"

He breaks the embrace and looks at me, "No… that isn't right."  
他挣脱了拥抱，看着我，“不……那不对。”

I stay patient. Fuyutsuki said this might happen. That he might be confused. I try to reassure him.  
我保持耐心。冬月说过这可能会发生。他可能会感到困惑。我试图安慰他。

"Look… you've been hurt for nearly three weeks Shinji this is going to be difficult but… it is what happened. We've got to go."  
“听着……你已经受伤近三周了，真嗣，这会很困难，但……事情确实发生了。我们得走了。”

I reach out for his hand and Shinji pulls away. He actually pulled away from me. What has gotten into him? Why is he suddenly acting this way?  
我伸手去握他的手，但真嗣却抽开了。他真的从我身边躲开了。他这是怎么了？为什么突然这样？

"No… this isn't real!" “不……这不是真的！”

Not real? I can feel myself starting to lose my patience. I know I shouldn't but this isn't the place to deal with this. I have to get him back to the facility. He shouldn't be out.  
不是真的？我开始感到耐心在流失。我知道我不该这样，但这里不是处理这些的地方。我得带他回设施。他不该在外面。

"Are you stupid? Of course this is real!"  
“你傻吗？这当然是真实的！”

He shoots back a reply instantly, "No! I was in the Eva! This is just that Angel, the one in orbit trying to attack my mind again."  
他立刻回了一句，“不！我在 Eva 里！这只是那个天使，轨道上的那个，又在试图攻击我的思维。”

I feel something snap inside me at those words. I try to keep my voice level but feel it raise at some points. I need to get him back, even if I have to drag him.  
听到那些话，我内心有什么东西断裂了。我努力保持语调平稳，但某些时刻还是忍不住提高。我必须把他带回来，哪怕得硬拽。

"Idiot! What are you talking about! That was me that Angel attacked and you know it. You know that Shinji! Come on, we need to get you back to the shelter, you've been through a lot. You shouldn't be up."  
"傻瓜！你在说什么！那是我被那个天使攻击了，你明明知道。你知道的，真嗣！快点，我们需要带你回避难所，你经历了太多。你不应该起来的。"

I reach for his hand again but this time he pushes me away forcefully and yells back at me.  
我再次伸手去握他的手，但这次他用力推开我，对我大吼。

"NO! Stop it! Stop it! This isn't real, you're not my Asuka!"  
“不！住手！住手！这不是真的，你不是我的明日香！”

He turns away from me and without thinking I reach towards him. I feel the anger surge up inside me at what he said. I feel the tears burning in my eyes at him saying I'm not his Asuka. I grab his collar and spin him around and pull my hand back to slap him. I sent my hand forward and then…  
他转身背对我，我不假思索地伸手去抓他。听到他说的话，怒火在我心中升腾。泪水因他那句“你不是我的明日香”而灼热了眼眶。我抓住他的衣领，猛地转过他，挥手准备扇他一巴掌。我伸出手，然后……

**Asuka & Shinjis Quarters 明日香与真嗣的房间**

My eyes flicker open and I realize I'm back in the bedroom of our quarters. I groggily sit up on the bed and look around. It was a dream, just another bad dream. I didn't get much sleep last night again, I must have fallen asleep when I came here to play a game. I wipe the stupid tears from my eyes. I hate these nightmares, I just wish they would leave me alone. I need him to wake up so badly. I need him to hold me so I can get a good night of sleep.  
我的眼睛忽闪着睁开，意识到自己回到了我们房间的卧室。我昏昏沉沉地从床上坐起来，环顾四周。原来是一场梦，又是一场噩梦。昨晚我又没怎么睡，一定是来这里玩游戏时睡着了。我擦去愚蠢的眼泪。我讨厌这些噩梦，我只希望它们能放过我。我多么需要他醒来。我多么需要他抱紧我，让我能好好睡一觉。

I stand up and head into the bathroom to wash my face. The images of that dream still present in my mind. Usually I'll forget them fairly quickly, maybe an image or two will stick in my mind but for some reason I can remember every details of this one. I can still see the beach, I can see him standing there in his Plugsuit.  
我站起来走进浴室洗脸。那个梦的影像仍在我脑海中挥之不去。通常我会很快忘记它们，或许会有一两个画面留在记忆中，但不知为何，这次我能记住每一个细节。我仍能看到那片海滩，看到他站在那里，穿着他的插入栓服。

I blink. Dream me is an idiot. Dream me should have realized it was a dream when she saw him in his Plugsuit. He's not in a Plugsuit, he's wearing a hospital gown at the moment with very little on underneath. Why would he even have his Plugsuit, it was destroyed as was mine.  
我眨了眨眼。梦中的我真是个傻瓜。梦中的我本该在看到他穿着插入栓服时就意识到这是梦境。他现在并没有穿插入栓服，而是穿着医院的病号服，里面几乎什么都没穿。他怎么可能还留着插入栓服呢，那件衣服早已和我的一样被毁掉了。

"Heh, stupid dreams… We never realize how strange they are until we're out of them do we?"  
“呵呵，愚蠢的梦……我们总是要等到梦醒后才意识到它们有多奇怪，不是吗？”

I wonder how long I slept for. A quick glance at the alarm clock tells me it wasn't very long. I decide I should probably get out of this facility for a while. I haven't been out of here in three weeks, I can go visit the store. I haven't raided it for all the games in there yet, maybe I can bring another one. I'll go grab my jacket and car keys from the hospital room.  
我想知道我睡了多久。匆匆瞥了一眼闹钟，发现时间并不长。我决定或许应该暂时离开这个设施。我已经三周没出去了，可以去商店逛逛。那里还有不少游戏我没搜刮完，或许可以再带一款回家。我去病房拿上外套和车钥匙就出发。

It doesn't take long for me to get back to the level with Shinjis room in. Yet as soon as I enter the floor I get a sense that something is wrong. There are guards posted outside the main room with another posted outside the room for me and Shinji. As I pass the guards eye me curiously. They look like they want to say something to be but think better of it.  
没过多久，我就回到了有真嗣房间的那一层。然而，我一踏入这一层，就感觉到有些不对劲。主房间外站着守卫，我和真嗣的房间外也各有一名守卫。当我经过守卫时，他们好奇地打量着我。他们看起来想对我说些什么，但又觉得不妥。

When I get to the room I see Misato, Rebecca and Fuyutsuki stood around Shinji. Fuyutsuki is stood near the machines and has something else with him. I don't know what it is nor can I make it out from here. Each of them are wearing grim expressions and I feel my heart drop. Something's happened to Shinji. Without thinking I burst through the door, Misato immediately turns around.  
当我到达房间时，我看到美里、丽贝卡和冬月站在真嗣周围。冬月站在机器旁边，还带着其他东西。我不知道那是什么，也无法从这里辨认出来。他们每个人都面色凝重，我感到心沉了下去。真嗣一定发生了什么事。我不假思索地冲进门去，美里立刻转过身来。

"What… what's happening?"  
“怎……怎么了？”

I stutter out the words and without giving a response Misato grabs me by the shoulder and leads me out of the room. I try to go back in but her grip tightens on me.  
我结结巴巴地说出话来，还没等我回应，Misato 就抓住我的肩膀，带我离开了房间。我想回去，但她紧紧抓住了我。

"Misato… what… what's happening?"  
“Misato…怎么…怎么回事？”

She looks at me and she does the worst thing she can do, she lies.  
她看着我，做了她能做的最糟糕的事，她撒谎了。

"Nothing, we're just running some tests. It's nothing to worry about, just go…"  
“没什么，我们只是在进行一些测试。不用担心，继续……”

I shake her off and try to move past her again ignoring the lie. The guard stood by the door looks like he is unsure of what to do, his eyes keep moving from myself and Misato to focusing on the wall in front of him. Misato grabs me again before I can make any progress.  
我甩开她的手，试图再次从她身边走过，无视她的谎言。站在门口的警卫看起来不知所措，他的目光不断在我和美里之间游移，最后聚焦在他面前的墙上。美里再次抓住我，阻止我前进。

"Asuka! Please just… we…"  
“明日香！请……我们……”

I stop and look into her eyes. I can tell she is trying to be strong, trying to be the adult and trying to be Captain Katsuragi. That's how I know something is seriously wrong. I'm trying to stay strong myself, I'm trying to not yell or scream but I can feel it there.  
我停下脚步，凝视着她的眼睛。我能看出她在努力坚强，试图扮演成年人，试图成为 Katsuragi 舰长。正是这样，我知道一定有什么严重的问题。我自己也在努力保持坚强，努力不喊不叫，但我能感觉到那种情绪在涌动。

"What's… what's wrong with him?"  
“他……他怎么了？”

"It's… nothing to worry about, I'll tell you later."  
“没什么好担心的，我稍后告诉你。”

"Bullshit!" "胡说八道！"

My shout echoes down the hallways, "Don't lie to me Misato! What's happening, why are all three of you in there? Why are there guards posted."  
我的喊声在走廊里回荡，“别对我撒谎，美里！到底发生了什么，为什么你们三个都在里面？为什么还有警卫守着。”

She kneels down bringing her head to my level. I wish she hadn't. She smiles innocently at me. I wish she didn't. And she lies to me again.  
她蹲下身，将头凑到与我平视的高度。我真希望她没有这么做。她对我露出无辜的微笑。我真希望她没有。然后她再次对我撒了谎。

"It's just a security precaution, it's nothing to do with Shinji."  
"这只是安全预防措施，与真嗣无关。"

I say nothing. I bow my head and I start to turn away. I take a deep breath and try to supress the anger. Yet it's rising inside me, the knowledge that she is lying to me. The knowledge that she is keeping something from me about Shinji.  
我一言不发。我低下头，开始转身离开。我深吸一口气，试图压抑愤怒。然而它在我内心升腾，她对我撒谎的事实。她对真嗣有所隐瞒的事实。

"You have to go now Asuka, I'll talk to you later."  
"你现在得走了，明日香，我们晚点再谈。"

I spin back around and slap her. The sound of it resounds through all the corridors. I've made a mistake and I know it. I wait for the reaction. I wait for her to yell at me and to grab me or hit me back. Yet it doesn't come. Instead she remains on her knees, her face still turns away from me. Her hand raised to her cheek rubbing it gently.  
我猛地转过身，一巴掌扇在她脸上。那声音在所有走廊里回荡。我知道自己犯了个错误。我等待着她的反应，等着她对我大喊大叫，抓住我或还手。然而这一切都没有发生。她只是跪在地上，脸依旧转向一边。她的手举到脸颊旁，轻轻地揉着。

It's at this moment I realize things are really serious. I realize I've went too far again. I've let me anger at her lying get to me. I had to know the truth but there were other ways to get her to tell me. Yet I didn't go with any of them.  
就在这时，我意识到事情真的严重了。我意识到自己又走得太远了。我对她的谎言感到愤怒，失去了控制。我必须知道真相，但还有其他方法让她告诉我。然而，我却没有选择其中任何一种。

"M-Misato?" “美-美里？”

She gives no reply. 她没有回答。

"I'm sorry… I… was angry, I didn't mean to. I just wanted to know what was wrong with Shinji…"  
“对不起……我……当时很生气，我不是故意的。我只是想知道真嗣怎么了……”

No reply again. Her shoulders twitch a little bit and I see her eyes drop.  
依旧没有回应。她的肩膀微微颤动，我看到她的目光低垂。

"Please… talk to me, slap me back… please…"  
"请…跟我说话，打醒我…求你了…"

"A-Asuka…" "明日香…"

Her voice is so weak.  
她的声音如此微弱。

"I'm sorry Asuka… I… I was being selfish…"  
"对不起，明日香……我……我太自私了……"

She starts to cry while I stand there awkwardly looking towards the guard and Misato. Shinji I can deal with but a grown woman I don't really know what to do. I look towards the door and see Fuyutsuki and Rebecca walking around Shinji. My first instinct is go in there but I can't leave Misato on her own. There is an empty room near to us. I open the door and gently lead her in there.  
她开始哭泣，而我尴尬地站在那里，目光投向守卫和美里。真嗣我还能应付，但对一个成年女性，我真不知道该怎么办。我望向门口，看到副校长和丽贝卡在真嗣周围走动。我的第一反应是进去，但我不能丢下美里一个人。附近有一间空房间。我打开门，轻轻地引导她进去。

I have to be strong now. Just like I was for Shinji, I'll cry and scream later in our quarters. I'll punch the walls and whatever then. Misato lowers her hand from her cheek and I cringe at how red it is already. I did that.  
我现在必须坚强。就像我为真嗣所做的那样，稍后在我们房间里我会哭喊和尖叫。我会捶打墙壁，做任何事情。美里将手从脸颊上放下，我看到那片红肿，心中一紧。那是我造成的。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"What's wrong with him Misato? Please don't lie to me. I can handle it alright."  
"他怎么了，美里？请不要对我撒谎。我能承受得住的。"

She looks defeated. I've never seen her like this before. I'm so used to seeing her be the strong NERV Captain. I've seen her be angry and upset but never like this.  
她看起来很沮丧。我从未见过她这样。我习惯了看到她作为 NERV 的坚强队长。我见过她生气和难过，但从未像现在这样。

She looks up at me finally, "Shinji is…"  
她终于抬头看向我，"真嗣他…"

She takes a deep breath and I prepare myself for the news. I have to stay strong for now. I won't be upset in front of her. Yet every moment I stand her knowing something is wrong feels like a dagger twisting itself in my body.  
她深吸一口气，我准备好接受消息。现在我必须坚强。不会在她面前表现出难过。然而，每当我站在这里，知道有些不对劲时，感觉就像一把匕首在体内扭转。

"Is he…" “他……”

She shakes her head, "No… he isn't. He's alive and he's stable but… we found something…"  
她摇摇头，“不……他没事。他还活着，情况稳定，但是……我们发现了一些东西……”

The feeling eases ever so slightly, "What… what did you find?"  
那种感觉稍稍缓和了一些，“什…你发现了什么？”

"I didn't want to tell you Asuka, please believe me I didn't want you to worry about it. I didn't want to believe it myself, I just hoped it would have gone away or maybe it was a mistake. That's why they're in there now, finding out. That's why I tried to get you to leave but…"  
“我不想告诉你的，明日香，请相信我，我不想让你担心。我自己也不愿意相信，我只是希望它会消失，或者可能是个误会。这就是为什么他们现在在里面，查明真相。这就是为什么我试图让你离开，但是…”

"I can handle it Misato… what did you find?"  
“我能应付的，美里…你发现了什么？”

She stares me directly in the eyes, her tears have stopped and it feels like there is an eternity of silence before she utters the next words. Words I don't want to believe.  
她直视着我的眼睛，泪水已止，仿佛在说出下句话之前，有一段永恒的沉默。那些我不愿相信的话。

"An Angel." “一个天使。”

---

The coffee burns my lips as I take a sip, its bitter taste matching my mood at this moment in time. Fuyutsuki has his eyes on me, a concerned look on his face.  
我抿了一口咖啡，烫痛了嘴唇，那苦涩的味道与此时此刻的心情如出一辙。冬月注视着我，脸上带着关切的神情。

"You told her?" "你告诉她了？"

All I can do is nod, "Yes… I didn't want to but she had a right to know. She loves him and keeping the truth from her would have done more damage in the long run."  
我只能点头，“是的……我不想的，但她有权知道。她爱他，长远来看，隐瞒真相只会造成更大的伤害。”

"How did she take it?"  
"她反应如何？"

"As would be expected. She yelled at me for keeping the truth from her, she screamed and she cried while I held her. She asked if he was going to die and I told her he wasn't. She asked if we know how to get rid of it and I told her we were going to figure it out. She asked if…"  
"正如所料。她因为我对她隐瞒真相而对我大喊大叫，她尖叫着，哭泣着，而我抱着她。她问他会死吗，我告诉她他不会。她问我们是否知道如何摆脱它，我告诉她我们会想办法解决。她问如果…"

I stop myself before continuing, he probably already knows what she would have asked and my stock responses. My lies to Asuka.  
我及时打住，没有继续说下去，他大概已经知道她会问什么，以及我那些老套的回答。我对明日香的谎言。

"Did I do the right thing in telling her?"  
"我告诉她真相，这样做对吗？"

He sighs as he stands up and looks at the documents pinned to the wall. All of the results of the tests and comparisons with previous records for Shinji up there. All afternoon he's been searching for anything that might be able to get the Angel out of Shinji.  
他叹了口气，站起身来，看着钉在墙上的文件。所有关于真嗣的测试结果和与以往记录的对比都在上面。整个下午，他一直在寻找任何可能将使徒从真嗣身上赶走的方法。

"I think… withholding the truth would have hurt her more as you said."  
“我想……正如你所说，隐瞒真相会让她更受伤。”

He pauses for a moment, "Besides, I feel that many of the issues we faced before returning were due to information being withheld from various people."  
他顿了一下，“此外，我觉得我们回归前遇到的许多问题都是因为向不同的人隐瞒了信息。”

"You mean like NERVs real goal?"  
“你是说像 NERV 的真正目标那样？”

He nods and gives a dry smile, "I mean a great many things. The nature of the Evangelion Units, the souls residing within them. The fact that it was Yui and Kyoko's own choices to reside within the Evangelions and indeed… much of what I knew. It is of no comfort but I do regret my decisions, if I hadn't have been so blinded by my desire to see Yui again… perhaps I'd have stopped Gendo myself."  
他点点头，露出一丝干涩的微笑，“我指的是很多事情。福音战士机体的本质，寄宿其中的灵魂。事实上，是唯和京子自己的选择，居住在福音战士中，确实……我所知道的大部分事情。这并没有带来安慰，但我确实后悔我的决定，如果我没有被再次见到唯的渴望蒙蔽了双眼……也许我会亲自阻止源堂。”

I've never heard Fuyutsuki talk about Yui before. I know little of their relationship only that he had feelings for her and she was a former student of his. I knew he and Gendo Ikari went back many years and while I worked at NERV I did always question their relationship.  
我从未听过冬月谈论唯。我对他们的关系知之甚少，只知道他对她有感情，而她是他以前的学生。我知道他和碇源堂交往多年，而在我在 NERV 工作期间，我总是对他们的关系感到好奇。

Yet I can't find it within myself to be angry at Fuyutsuki for his actions because we were all guilty of the same thing. I knew so much I should have said to Shinji, if I had told him about the Angel within NERV or that it was Touji inside the Evangelion would he have acted differently? If I had spent more time with Asuka would it have turned out differently? If I hadn't have just tried to use them as weapons to avenge my father, would things have turned out differently?  
然而，我无法对冬月的行为感到愤怒，因为我们都有同样的罪责。我知道很多本该对真嗣说的事情，如果我告诉他 NERV 内部有使徒，或者那台 EVA 里是薰，他会不会有不同的行动？如果我多花时间陪伴明日香，结果会不会不同？如果我没有仅仅把他们当作复仇父亲的武器，事情会不会有所不同？

I ask myself these questions every night. I ask if there was a way to save Kaji. I ask if there was a way to stop Asuka from spiralling the way she did. The answer is of course yes, there were ways. Some of which I had control over and some I didn't. Yet it doesn't matter now because we can't go back and do it again. Even if we did try things might end up being worse. All we can do is recognize the cycles we create for ourselves which cause these problems and try to break it. Asuka is managing it, I will too.  
我每晚都在问自己这些问题。我问是否有办法拯救加持。我问是否有办法阻止明日香那样失控。答案当然是有的，有些是我能控制的，有些则不然。但现在这些都不重要了，因为我们无法回到过去重新来过。即使我们尝试，结果可能更糟。我们能做的就是认识到自己制造的循环导致了这些问题，并努力打破它。明日香正在努力，我也会。

I take another sip of coffee. I should have put milk in this thing, the taste is so bitter.  
我又喝了一口咖啡。我应该加些牛奶的，这味道太苦了。

"So what did we learn?"  
"那么我们学到了什么？"

"The Angel has grown in size again, it appears to be parasitic in nature but it's nothing like anything we have seen before. If it was just a simple parasite we could try to extract it. This appears to exist in some other form we can't recognize."  
"天使的体积似乎又增大了，它的性质看起来是寄生性的，但这与我们之前见过的任何东西都不一样。如果它只是一个简单的寄生虫，我们可以尝试将其提取出来。但这种存在似乎是以我们无法识别的某种形式存在的。"

"So we're out of luck?"  
"所以我们运气不好？"

"If we had access to the MAGI then perhaps a solution could be found but the problem is that the Angel hasn't actually manifested any physical form yet. It appears to be growing when Shinji undergoes these periods of enhanced brain activity as noted before but…"  
"如果我们能接触到 MAGI，或许能找到解决方案，但问题是天使尚未显现出任何实体形态。正如之前所记录的，当真嗣经历这些大脑活动增强的时期时，它似乎在成长，但是……"

It's not good news. I say nothing and wait for him to continue.  
这不是好消息。我保持沉默，等待他继续说下去。

"But it's reminiscent of the twelfth Angel. We are aware of its existence but we have no way to fight it. Beyond the one method which I am sure none of us wish to consider."  
"但这让人想起第十二使徒。我们知道它的存在，却无从应对。除了那个我确信我们都不愿考虑的方法。"

"You mean killing Shinji…"  
"你是说杀死真嗣…"

He nods grimly, "Yes I do. In theory you kill the host and the parasite dies with them. Yet we're dealing with an Angel, so it is my belief that even if we were to take such a drastic option this would probably not give us the expected results. Besides, I have no desire to see Shinji die and it would not be by my hand he would die."  
他严肃地点头，"是的，我是这么想的。理论上，杀死宿主，寄生虫也会随之死亡。但我们面对的是使徒，所以我倾向于认为，即便采取如此极端的手段，可能也不会得到预期的结果。此外，我绝不想看到真嗣死去，更不会亲手让他丧命。"

"Your solution is at least different to Ritsuko's for dealing with the twelfth at least."  
"至少你的方案与律子处理第十二使徒的方法不同。"

The twelfth Angel, I remember it well. It could be argued that this was the Angel that started the downward spiral of us all. It appeared like a giant sphere in the sky but the real Angel was what we first thought to be its shadow on the floor. It pulled Shinji into itself and it we still don't know how Shinji managed to get free. Yet he did, Evangelion Unit 01 tore through the Angel and burst from the spherical object shortly before we were going to drop N2 mines into the being.  
第十二使徒，我记得很清楚。可以说，正是这个使徒开启了我们所有人的下坡路。它在天空中出现时像一个巨大的球体，但真正的使徒是我们最初以为是它在地上的影子。它将真嗣吸入其中，我们至今仍不知道真嗣是如何逃脱的。然而他确实逃脱了，初号机撕裂了使徒，并在我们准备投放 N2 地雷之前从球形物体中冲了出来。

I smile remembering the thought of him finally emerging. I remember how terrified I was to see Unit 01 burst through that beast. It showered the city in blood, a horrific sight but at the same time it had brought Shinji back to us, "Maybe Shinji will defeat it himself."  
我微笑着回忆他最终出现的情景。我记得当时看到初号机从那怪物中冲出时，我是多么恐惧。它让城市沐浴在鲜血中，一幅恐怖的景象，但与此同时，它也把真嗣带回了我们身边，‘也许真嗣能独自击败它。’

"Maybe he will." ‘也许他能。’

---

I'm at the beach, the one from my dream earlier. Misato let me come here on the condition I had an armed guard follow me. It was fair enough, I was followed everywhere when I was in Tokyo-3 for my own protection by Section 2. This is no different. The armed guard will keep her distance, watch over me and let me do what I need to do.  
我来到了海滩，正是之前梦中的那个地方。美里让我来这里，条件是我必须有武装护卫跟随。这很公平，我在第三新东京市时，为了我的安全，第二支部也总是派人跟着我。现在并无不同。武装护卫会保持距离，看护我，让我能做我需要做的事。

What I need to do isn't anything special. I don't even know why I came here, it certainly wasn't to stare at Rei's giant head. It creeps me out more than Rei ever did. I used to be jealous of her, she was the golden child who spent all her time with the Commander. I never wanted to spend time with the Commander but I did want some attention, I wanted praise for my talents and my hard work. I never realized what was really going on. That Rei was just a puppet being used by him, I guess when I called her a doll I wasn't that far off the mark.  
我需要做的事并不特别。我甚至不知道为何来此，肯定不是为了盯着绫波那巨大的头像。这比绫波本人更让我感到不安。我曾嫉妒她，她是那个与指挥官形影不离的金童。我从未想与指挥官共度时光，但我确实渴望一些关注，希望因我的才华和努力而受到赞扬。我从未意识到真正发生了什么。绫波不过是他操纵的傀儡，我想当我称她为玩偶时，也并非完全偏离事实。

Except she wasn't a doll at the end was she? She betrayed the Commander, she helped Shinji and she even helped me. After all I said and did, she still helped me.  
但最终，她不再是玩偶了，对吧？她背叛了指挥官，帮助了真嗣，甚至也帮助了我。尽管我曾说过和做过的一切，她依然伸出援手。

I wonder if she is out there in that sea of LCL somewhere, and if she can come back one day. She merged with Lilith and became something completely different to us though. Her physical body was falling apart at the end so I don't know.  
我不知道她是否在那片 LCL 海洋的某个角落，有朝一日能否归来。她与莉莉丝融合，变成了与我们截然不同的存在。她的肉体在最后时刻已支离破碎，我无从知晓。

If she did come back I'd apologize to her for the way I acted and then I'd thank her. Afterwards I'd probably get frustrated with her as she'd say something that makes it sound like she is shrugging off my apology and gratitude. She'd probably question why I was apologizing or being thankful and I'd get angry and misinterpret it and then… then I'd hug her.  
如果她真的回来了，我会为我的行为向她道歉，然后感谢她。之后，我可能会因为她的话而感到沮丧，仿佛她在轻描淡写地忽略我的歉意和感激。她可能会质疑我为何道歉或感激，我会因此生气并误解她的意思，然后……然后我会拥抱她。

I stand still on the shore looking out, as I turn my head I can see where we returned. I still don't know why I came here. Maybe a part of me was expecting to see him here like in that dream I had.  
我静静地站在岸边，眺望着远方，转头时能看到我们归来的地方。我仍不明白为何来到这里。或许，我内心的一部分期待着在这里见到他，就像我曾做过的那个梦一样。

That dream is still playing on my mind. I don't usually remember all of the details of a dream like I am now but this one more so than usual. It just felt so real, everything that happened in it from the way the breeze is blowing to the smells I experienced and just touching him was all so real.  
那个梦依然萦绕在我的脑海中。我通常不会记得梦境的所有细节，但这次却异常清晰。它感觉如此真实，从微风拂面的方式到我所体验的气味，以及触摸他的感觉，一切都那么真实。

I guess I feel even stranger knowing that while I was having it something was happening to Shinji. Misato told me about the Angel inside him, that they're trying to fight it. Maybe it was a part of it. Maybe somehow it affected me because of the time I've spent by his side, maybe I got a glimpse into what he is experiencing.  
我想，知道在我做梦的同时，真嗣正经历着某种事情，这让我感觉更加奇怪。美里告诉我他体内有使徒，他们在与之战斗。也许这是其中的一部分。也许是因为我陪伴在他身边的时间，我以某种方式受到了影响，或许我窥见了他的经历。

"Hah, don't be so stupid Asuka. It was just a dream."  
“哈，别傻了，明日香。那只是一个梦。”

**Day 23 第 23 天**

The train carriage is empty when I step onto it, I have no destination in mind just anywhere will do for now. I just want to be alone. I can't concentrate in that place anymore, we've got guards posted outside the hospital room all the time now. No one knows what to expect regarding the Angel. Fuyutsuki hasn't come any closer to figuring out how to get it out of Shinji. Misato keeps on reassuring me things will be alright but I've heard that before. Everything was going to be alright with my mother, look how that ended up.  
当我踏上列车车厢时，里面空无一人，我心中并无目的地，任何地方都行，此刻我只求独处。我再也无法在那地方集中精神，医院病房外现在总是有警卫驻守。关于那个天使，没人知道会发生什么。副校长还没能找出如何让天使离开真嗣的方法。美里一直在安慰我，一切都会好起来的，但我以前也听过这样的话。我母亲的事情也会好起来的，结果呢？

The train pulls away from the station just as the sun starts to set. I put in my headphones and set the music player to a random track. Immediately my ears are filled with Peter Gabriels voice.  
列车在太阳开始落山时驶离车站。我戴上耳机，将音乐播放器调至随机播放模式。立刻，彼得·加布里埃尔的声音充满了我的耳朵。

_'Can you tell me where my country lies…  
'你能告诉我我的国家在哪里吗…  
Said the unifaun to his true love's eyes.'  
独角兽对真爱之眼说道。'_

I close my eyes and let myself just listen to the music as the train continues its journey through the city. No destination, just me and the music. I'll get off when this album finishes and then call up for a ride back to the facility. Misato will probably be worried about how late I'm out but it doesn't matter, I can handle myself. It's not like there are many people here anymore.  
我闭上眼睛，让自己只是沉浸在音乐中，随着火车继续穿越城市。没有目的地，只有我和音乐。这张专辑结束时我会下车，然后打电话叫车回设施。美里可能会担心我这么晚还没回去，但没关系，我能照顾自己。这里已经没多少人了。

_"Follow on! Till the Grail sun sets in the mould.  
继续前行！直到圣杯之日沉入尘土。  
Follow on! Till the gold is cold.  
继续前行！直到黄金冷却。  
Dancing out with the moonlit knight!  
与月光骑士共舞！  
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout!"  
绿盾骑士们盖章呐喊！_

In my mind I picture myself at that concert I missed out on going to back before Third Impact. It was a tribute act but they were going to play most of this song. I didn't end up going because I couldn't go by myself and I was too stubborn to ask anyone to go with me. So I ended up missing out on it. I bet they played Supper's Ready as well, full costumes and everything. Doesn't matter now, I don't need a song about walking through the apocalypse, I've already done it. Not quite the same as Peter and the crew described.  
我脑海中浮现出自己置身于那场在第三次冲击前错过的音乐会的场景。那是一场致敬演出，他们本打算演奏这首歌的大部分内容。我最终没去成，因为我无法独自前往，又太固执不愿邀请任何人同行。于是我错过了那场演出。我敢打赌他们还演奏了《晚餐准备好了》，全套服装应有尽有。现在这些都不重要了，我不需要一首关于穿越末日的歌曲，我已经亲身经历过了。与彼得和团队所描述的并不完全相同。

I open my eyes and realize I'm no longer alone in the carriage. I look ahead and on one of the seats is a brown haired boy. His head is dropped and he's staring straight down at the floor. He has earphones in and is clutching a small black object. I look a little bit closer and my blood runs cold, I feel my heart skip a beat.  
我睁开眼睛，意识到车厢里不再只有我一个人。我向前看去，一个棕发男孩坐在其中一个座位上。他低着头，直盯着地板。他戴着耳机，手里紧握着一个黑色小物件。我仔细一看，顿时血液凝固，心跳漏了一拍。

_'Shinji?' '真嗣？'_

I switch off my music and walk over to him. It is him! He sees my shadow approaching and looks up at me. He looks sad, I wonder what's wrong. I wonder what he is doing here. Has he woken up? Decided to try to find me, maybe heard where I was?  
我关掉音乐，走向他。真的是他！他看到我的影子靠近，抬头看向我。他看起来很难过，我不知道发生了什么。我想知道他在这里做什么。他醒了吗？决定来找我，也许听说了我在哪里？

He takes out his earphones and smiles nervously at me.  
他摘下耳机，对我紧张地笑了笑。

"Asuka… what are you doing here?"  
"明日香…你在这里做什么？"

"I could ask you the same question! Shouldn't you be resting?"  
"我也可以问你同样的问题！你不是应该在休息吗？"

Something feels wrong, I can feel it deep down but I take a seat next to him anyway.  
有些不对劲，我内心深处能感觉到，但我还是在他旁边坐了下来。

"I know… I'm sorry but I just, I had to get out for a short time."  
"我知道……对不起，我只是，我需要暂时离开一会儿。"

I laugh, "Yeah, I know what you mean, want to ride this together and then return home?"  
我笑着说，"“是啊，我明白你的意思，想一起骑一会儿然后回家吗？”"

He nods and I intertwine my hand with his. He looks like he has something on his mind. Of course he would, he's just woken up from a coma. He'll probably be confused and scared. I sit a little bit closer to him.  
他点点头，我与他十指相扣。他看起来心事重重。当然会这样，他刚从昏迷中醒来。他可能会感到困惑和害怕。我稍微向他靠近了一些。

"Asuka… I… I'm sorry about what happened."  
"明日香…我…对于发生的事，我很抱歉。"

Typical Shinji, apologizing for something that isn't his fault.  
典型的真嗣，为不是他的错的事情道歉。

"Idiot, it wasn't your fault. It wasn't anyone's fault, believe me I've blamed myself enough for it. Misato managed to snap me out of it though."  
"傻瓜，那不是你的错。也不是任何人的错，相信我，我已经为此自责够了。不过，美里设法让我走出来了。"

"S-She did?" "她真的做了？"

"Yeah. I guess I blamed myself a bit too much and… well you don't need to know the rest yet. Just know no one is to blame."  
"是的。我想我有点过于自责了，而且……好吧，你暂时不需要知道剩下的。只要知道没有人应该被责怪。"

"I know, I just made you all worry and…"  
"我知道，我只是让你们大家都担心了，而且……"

I place my finger across his lips to shut him up.  
我用手指按在他的唇上，让他安静下来。

"Schweigen meiner Shinji. You think too much, remember what we always said?"  
“安静，我的真嗣。你想得太多了，还记得我们常说的话吗？”

He grins, "It always gets us into trouble."  
他咧嘴一笑，“这总是让我们陷入麻烦。”

"Exactly." "确实。"

A gentle silence falls upon us. I still can't help but feel that something is wrong but as the train moves through the city and we hold each other's hand I don't care. I'm just happy to be here with my Shinji again. I rest my head on his shoulder and close my eyes again.  
一片温柔的寂静笼罩着我们。我仍不禁觉得有些不对劲，但随着列车穿过城市，我们紧握着彼此的手，我已不在乎。能再次与我的真嗣在一起，我感到无比幸福。我将头靠在他的肩上，再次闭上了眼睛。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Hmm…" “嗯……”

"This will be over soon… what are you… going to do then?"  
“这一切很快就会结束……你之后打算做什么？”

I open my eyes and that sense that something is wrong grows. What does he mean this will be over soon?  
我睁开眼睛，那种事情不对劲的感觉愈发强烈。他说的‘很快就会结束’是什么意思？

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"The Angels… they'll… stop right? What are you going to do after that? You're not going to go back to Germany are you?"  
“天使们……他们会……停下来对吧？之后你打算怎么办？不会回德国去吧？”

I suddenly sit up and look outside the train. That feeling keeps on growing as I see the city of Tokyo-3 around me. It's not in ruins, damaged certainly but it is here. I look along the train and it's still just me and Shinji here. My stomach drops as I realize something is very wrong all of a sudden. None of this is right, nothing here makes sense.  
我突然坐起身，望向窗外。那种感觉不断加剧，因为我看到了我周围的第三新东京市。它并未成为废墟，虽然确实受损，但依然存在。我沿着车厢看去，依旧只有我和真嗣在这里。我突然意识到有什么非常不对劲，这一切都不对，这里的一切都说不通。

"Asuka, are you alright?"  
“明日香，你还好吗？”

"Shinji… what… what are you talking about?"  
"真嗣…你…你在说什么？"

He looks at me confused and I see the look in his eyes instantly change. It's like he's making the same realization I am that something is incredibly wrong.  
他困惑地看着我，我立刻注意到他眼中的神情变了。仿佛他和我同时意识到有什么事情非常不对劲。

"I just… was wondering if you were going to be staying here after this was all over."  
"我只是…想知道这一切结束后，你是否还会留在这里。"

I can't even bring myself to call him an idiot, I can't even raise my normal defences against this. Everything suddenly feels very wrong. All of a sudden I'm terrified. I try to not show it, instead I just stutter out a response to him.  
我甚至无法说服自己称他为白痴，面对这一切，我连平常的防御机制都提不起来。一切都突然变得非常不对劲。我突然感到恐惧。我试图不表现出来，只是结结巴巴地回应他。

"I… I don't understand… what do you mean when this is all over?"  
“我……我不明白……你说这一切结束时是什么意思？”

I swallow waiting for the answer, dreading the answer. He hesitates a moment before telling me, "I mean when the Angels stop attacking…"  
我咽了咽口水等待答案，害怕听到答案。他犹豫了一下才告诉我，“我是说当天使们停止攻击时……”

Did he really say that? Did I mishear him, what does he mean the Angels stop attacking. It's over, re know it's over. I have to make sure that is what he meant.  
他真的那么说了吗？是我听错了吗，他说使徒停止攻击了。一切都结束了，我们知道已经结束了。我必须确认他的意思确实是这样。

"Shinji what do you mean, the Angel's stopped attacking. We beat them all remember?"  
“真嗣，你是什么意思，使徒停止攻击了？我们打败了所有使徒，记得吗？”

The train is coming to a stop, I'll get us both off the train right away and get someone to take us back to the facility. I have no idea what is happening here, I don't know why Tokyo-3 is here but it doesn't matter we can figure it out later.  
列车即将停下，我会立刻带我们俩下车，找人送我们回设施。我不知道这里发生了什么，也不明白为什么东京-3 会在这里，但这些都不重要，我们可以稍后再弄清楚。

I stand up and try to get him to stand as well but he sits there looking up at me with a confused look on his face.  
我站起身，试图让他也站起来，但他只是坐在那里，抬头看着我，脸上带着困惑的表情。

"Come on Shinji, we should go. We'll get you back to the shelter."  
“来吧，真嗣，我们该走了。我们会带你回避难所。”

He shakes his head, "This isn't right."  
他摇了摇头，“这不对劲。”

"Shinji, we need to go."  
"真嗣，我们得走了。"

He resists me, "No, I… what is this? Who are you?"  
他抗拒着我，“不，我……这是什么？你是谁？”

He's just confused, I tell myself that and try not to get mad.  
他只是困惑，我告诉自己这一点，并努力不生气。

"Shinji you're just confused, come on we'll get you back to the shelter. It'll be alright."  
"真嗣，你只是有些困惑，来吧，我们带你回避难所。一切都会好起来的。"

I'm suddenly hit by the strangest feeling of déjà vu. This conversation has happened before but my mind feels so foggy right now. He looks at me his face a look of sheer panic.  
我突然被一种奇怪的既视感击中。这段对话以前发生过，但我的头脑现在感觉如此模糊。他看着我，脸上露出极度恐慌的表情。

"Asuka… what… what's happening?"  
"明日香…怎么…怎么回事？"

I shake my head, "I don't know Shinji."  
我摇摇头，“我不认识真嗣。”

"I… I was, I don't understand anything. I… I have to go…"  
“我……我之前，我什么都不明白。我……我得走了……”

I reach for him and try to pull him closer to me. He scrambles and tries to fight me off but I tighten by grip on him.  
我伸手去拉他，试图把他拉近我。他挣扎着试图挣脱，但我更紧地抓住了他。

"Shinji what are you doi-"  
"真嗣，你在做什么-"

"Let go of me! What is this, this isn't…!"  
"放开我！这是什么，这不是…！"

"I just want to help you Shinji, tell me what's wrong."  
"我只是想帮你，真嗣，告诉我哪里不对劲。"

Maybe it's me who needs the help. I look around and the city is intact, there are cranes in the distance performing repairs on a building. My heart starts pounding in my chest as I continue to struggle with Shinji. Suddenly he catches me off guard, he breaks free of me and shoves me to the ground. He doesn't stop to see if I'm alright but instead just runs off of the train. I scramble to my feet and try to follow him but as soon as he leaves the doors close and the train starts to move.  
或许需要帮助的是我。我环顾四周，城市完好无损，远处有起重机在一栋建筑上进行修缮。我继续与真嗣搏斗，心跳加速。突然，他出其不意地挣脱了我，将我推倒在地。他没有停下来确认我是否安好，而是直接跑下了火车。我挣扎着站起来，试图追上他，但门一关上，火车就开始移动了。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

I yell out and start trying to force the door open.  
我大喊着，开始用力试图强行打开车门。

"Shinji! You idiot!" “真嗣！你这个笨蛋！”

I keep on pulling at the door, desperately trying to get it open as the train moves slowly off of the platform. I watch as he escapes running down the stairs away from me. The door won't open, in frustration I turn and hammer the wall with my fists. Pain shoots through my hand and arm as I keep on hammering and screaming.  
我不断地拉扯着车门，拼命试图在火车缓缓驶离站台时将其打开。我看着他逃下楼梯，远离我而去。车门就是打不开，我气愤地转身用拳头猛击墙壁。随着我继续捶打和尖叫，疼痛从我的手和手臂传来。

"YOU IDIOT SHINJI! YOU IDIOT!"  
“你这个白痴真嗣！你这个白痴！”

I weakly hammer against the wall of the train one more time as it begins to roll through the countryside. Tears burn in my eyes as I drop to my knees.  
当火车开始穿越乡间时，我无力地再次捶打车厢墙壁。泪水灼烧着我的眼睛，我跪倒在地。

"You…. You idiot…" "你……你这个傻瓜……"

I kneel at the foot of the door and remain unable to figure out what just happened. I'm trying to stop myself crying, I always swore I'd never be this sort of girl. I wouldn't cry over a boy of all things but Shinji isn't just any boy. He's the one I swore to protect when I returned, yet now he's running away from me and I don't understand why. Did I do something wrong mama? Is that it? Did I screw him up that badly?  
我跪在门边，无法理解刚刚发生了什么。我努力抑制哭泣，我曾发誓绝不做这种女孩。我不会为任何男孩哭泣，但真嗣不仅仅是任何男孩。他是我发誓要保护的人，现在他却从我身边逃开，我不明白为什么。妈妈，我做错什么了吗？是这样吗？我把他搞砸得那么严重吗？

Suddenly I feel a hand rest on my shoulder. My first instinct is to swat it away but I can't bring myself to. Instead I turn my head slowly and I see another boy standing there. He's wearing one of the school uniforms from Tokyo-3 but with an orange T-Shirt underneath. His skin is pale, similar to how Rei's was. He has messy silvery hair and striking red eyes, I feel like I know him from somewhere. I don't care though, I have no time for this boy and his sympathy.  
突然，我感觉一只手搭在我的肩膀上。我的第一反应是甩开它，但我做不到。我慢慢地转过头，看到另一个男孩站在那里。他穿着东京-3 学校的制服，里面是一件橙色 T 恤。他的皮肤苍白，和绫波一样。他有着凌乱的银色头发和醒目的红眼睛，我觉得我在哪里见过他。不过我不在乎，我没有时间理会这个男孩和他的同情。

"Leave me alone." "别烦我。"

"Do not despair Second Child, he is not yet aware of the situation. You will have your chance to save him soon."  
"不要绝望，二子，他还未意识到局势。你很快就有机会救他了。"

"S-Save him? W-What situation?"  
"救他？什、什么局势？"

He stares at me, deep into my eyes. It's like he is looking into me. I know this person, I swear I do but I can't think how. Yet when he looks at me and with his touch I feel better somehow. I'm no longer crying, I feel warm and comforted. Like I do when Shinji holds me.  
他凝视着我，深深地望进我的眼眸。仿佛他能看透我。我发誓我认识这个人，但我怎么也想不起来。然而，当他看着我，用他的触摸，我不知怎的感到好转。我不再哭泣，感到温暖和安慰。就像真嗣抱着我时的感觉。

"I am afraid I cannot explain yet, it is not yet the time. We shall meet again Second, I look forward to it."  
“恐怕我现在还不能解释，时机未到。我们还会再见面的，第二，我期待着那一天。”

---

My eyes open and I'm staring up at a familiar ceiling. It was a dream, another strange dream. Yet unlike the last one I don't feel like crying, I feel just like I did at the end of the dream, I feel like I've been held.  
我睁开眼睛，凝视着熟悉的天花板。那是一场梦，又一次奇怪的梦。然而与上一次不同，我并没有想哭的感觉，我感到就像梦结束时那样，仿佛被拥抱过。

### Chapter 21 tears
**Day 23 第 23 天**

I step onto the empty train carriage and sit down on the seat nearest the door. They'll all be mad at me, I know it but I had to get away for a few hours. I was ordered to stay indoors for a few days, to stay in and around my bedroom. No school until I had been cleared by the Doctors at NERV. I'm not unhappy at being confined to the apartment. In truth I haven't felt like dealing with people since it happened.  
我踏入空荡荡的列车车厢，坐在离门最近的座位上。他们肯定都会生我的气，我知道，但我必须离开几个小时。我被命令在室内待几天，待在我的卧室附近。没有医生的许可，我不能去学校。NERV 的医生们。被限制在公寓里，我并不感到不快。事实上，自从那件事发生后，我就不想与人打交道。

What happened to me the other day, being attacked by that Angel was unlike anything I've ever felt before. Every image and memory it brought up is constantly going around in my head.  
前几天发生在我身上的事，被那个天使袭击，是我从未经历过的感觉。它唤起的每一个图像和记忆，一直在我的脑海中盘旋。

I've been a mixture of not speaking to people the last few days or snapping at them. Asuka has been losing patience with me. I need to snap out of it but I can't bring myself to talk about it. That Angel shown me everything, from my mother's death to my arrival in Tokyo-3, to our fights against the Angel's and even what I saw when I was trapped in the twelfth. How can I explain something like that to Asuka?  
这几天，我要么不和人说话，要么对他们发脾气。明日香已经对我失去了耐心。我需要振作起来，但我无法让自己谈论这件事。那个天使向我展示了从我母亲的去世到我来到东京-3，再到我们与天使的战斗，甚至我在第十二使徒中被困时看到的景象。我该如何向明日香解释这样的事情呢？

Yet what goes around my mind the most was the conversation I had with the Asuka there. The one I spoke to on the beach. The same beach we returned to after the Third Impact in that place. She looked so lost and upset, it was an illusion but her words about me being shot and getting me back to the facility. It felt so real. It really felt like I was back there again. That I can't explain to anyone.  
然而，我脑海中挥之不去的是与那里的明日香之间的对话。就是在海滩上与我交谈的那次。我们曾在那个地方，在第三次冲击后回到的那片海滩。她看起来如此迷茫和沮丧，虽然那是个幻觉，但她关于我被枪击并被带回设施的话语。感觉如此真实。真的感觉我仿佛又回到了那里。这一点我无法向任何人解释。

I feel the notes of the music on my SDAT float through my ears. It's my old tape, I haven't had to use this in a long time. Usually me and Asuka listen to music together on her music player but we haven't done that for a few days. I sigh as it moves onto the next track, I'll make this up to Asuka soon. I'll explain everything to her and really make it up to her.  
我感受到 SDAT 中的音乐旋律在我耳边飘荡。这是我旧磁带，已经很久没用过了。通常我和明日香会一起用她的音乐播放器听音乐，但最近几天我们没这么做。我叹了口气，随着音乐切换到下一首，我很快会补偿明日香的。我会向她解释一切，并真正弥补她。

I open my eyes just in time to see a shadow looming over me. I turn my head and I feel my heart twitch a little bit. I take out my headphones and give a nervous smile. What is she doing here? She must have followed me. There is a concerned look on her face, as she eyes me up and down.  
我睁开眼，正好看到一个身影笼罩在我上方。我转过头，心中微微一颤。我摘下耳机，露出紧张的微笑。她在这里做什么？她一定是跟着我来的。她脸上带着关切的表情，上下打量着我。

"Asuka… what are you doing here?"  
"明日香…你在这里做什么？"

"I could ask you the same question! Shouldn't you be resting?"  
"我也可以问你同样的问题！你不是应该在休息吗？"

I await a further barrage from her about how I should be back in bed. I await hearing about how worried she has been and how much of an idiot I am for running off. It doesn't come and I choose my words carefully.  
我等待着她再次对我发起连珠炮般的责备，关于我应该回到床上休息的事。我等待着听到她有多担心，以及我擅自离开是多么愚蠢。然而，这些话并没有出现，我谨慎地选择着言辞。

"I know… I'm sorry but I just, I had to get out for a short time."  
"我知道……对不起，我只是，我需要暂时离开一会儿。"

She laughs, "Yeah, I know what you mean, want to ride this together and then return home?"  
她笑了，“是啊，我明白你的意思，想一起骑车然后回家吗？”

I nod my head just as she intertwines her hand with mine. I look at her face and I notice something I've not seen before. Scarring around her eye, I glance down at her arm and see some light scarring there as well. When did she do that? I'm trying to think of when she was injured fighting the Angels but I can't. Suddenly I get the feeling that something is wrong. I feel her move closer to me, our shoulders are touching now.  
我点头的同时，她将手与我的手交缠在一起。我注视着她的脸，注意到一些我之前未曾见过的痕迹。她眼周的疤痕，我低头看向她的手臂，也发现了些许淡淡的疤痕。她是什么时候受的伤？我试图回忆她与天使战斗时受伤的情景，却怎么也想不起来。突然间，我感觉到有些不对劲。她向我靠近，我们的肩膀现在紧贴在一起。

I feel guilty about the way I've acted around her and Misato the last few days. Snapping at them or just being unresponsive. It isn't fair on them, they've tried to help me. They don't know what I had to see but they love me and…  
我对自己最近几天在她和美里身边的行为感到内疚。对她们发脾气或者干脆不理不睬。这对她们不公平，她们试图帮助我。她们不知道我经历了什么，但她们爱我，而且……

"Asuka… I… I'm sorry about what happened…"  
“明日香……我……我很抱歉发生了那样的事……”

"Idiot, it wasn't your fault. It wasn't anyone's fault, believe me I've blamed myself enough for it. Misato managed to snap me out of it though."  
"傻瓜，那不是你的错。也不是任何人的错，相信我，我已经为此自责够了。不过，美里设法让我走出来了。"

So she blamed herself for what happened too huh? Sounds like Asuka, Kaworu told me she didn't seem very happy about the Sniper Rifle not hitting the Angel properly and it having to be Kaworu who threw the lance. She never mentioned anything about the battle to me though. I wonder when her and Misato had that conversation though, it doesn't sound like Asuka to confide in Misato.  
所以她也把发生的事归咎于自己了，听起来很像明日香。碇告诉过我，她对狙击步枪没能准确击中使徒，最后不得不由碇投掷长矛这件事并不高兴。但她从未向我提起过战斗的细节。不过，我好奇她和美里是什么时候进行那次谈话的，明日香可不像是会向美里倾诉的人。

"S-She did?" "她真的做了？"

Asuka nods, "Yeah. I guess I blamed myself a bit too much and… well you don't need to know the rest yet. Just know no one is to blame."  
明日香点点头，“嗯。我想我责怪自己有点过头了，而且……好吧，你暂时不需要知道剩下的。只要知道没有人该受责备。”

The rest? I'm confused but I don't question her.  
剩下的？我有些困惑，但没有追问她。

"I know, I just made you all worry and…"  
"我知道，我只是让你们大家都担心了，而且……"

Her finger presses itself against my lips shutting me up instantly.  
她的手指按在我的唇上，立刻让我安静了下来。

"Schweigen meiner Shinji. You think too much, remember what we always said?"  
“安静，我的真嗣。你想得太多了，还记得我们常说的话吗？”

I can't help but grin, it's one of our little jokes.  
我不禁咧嘴笑了，这是我们之间的小玩笑之一。

"It always gets us into trouble."  
“这总是让我们陷入麻烦。”

"Exactly." "确实。"

A calming silence falls upon us. Asuka rests her head on my shoulder and she closes her eyes. I still feel like something is off somehow but I let it go. I put it down to my state after the attack on my mind and my general mood anyway. Instead I just hold her hand and feel the train continue its journey.  
一阵平静的沉默笼罩着我们。明日香把头靠在我的肩膀上，闭上了眼睛。我仍然觉得有些不对劲，但我想这可能是我受到精神攻击后的状态和情绪使然，于是便不再多想。相反，我只是握住她的手，感受着火车继续前行。

I find myself thinking ahead. There are only two Angels left now. I wonder if I've done enough to really change things. I'm confident I have, after the next one is defeated I'll tell Kaworu I know what he is. I'll tell him we can change things and that he doesn't have to die. We can beat SEELE. I look down at the redhead resting on my shoulder. My beautiful girlfriend, the one who I'd do anything for. We've never really spoken about the future, I wonder what she'll do when the Angels are defeated. It'll be different to what happened in that other place, she'll have a choice. Will they ask her to go back to Germany or will she stay here?  
我不禁开始思考未来。现在只剩下两位天使了。我不知道自己是否已经做得足够去真正改变一切。我自信我已经做到了，在下一个天使被击败后，我会告诉渚薰我知道他的身份。我会告诉他我们可以改变现状，他不必死去。我们可以击败 SEELE。我低头看着靠在我肩上的红发女孩。我美丽的女朋友，为了她我愿意做任何事。我们从未真正谈及过未来，我不知道当天使被击败后她会怎么做。那将不同于另一个地方发生的事，她将有选择。他们会要求她回到德国还是她会留在这里？

I know she has a step-mother and father back there. I know she doesn't get on with them. Will they want to see her again or will they leave her here?  
我知道她在那里有一个继母和父亲。我知道她和他们相处得不好。他们会想再见到她还是让她留在这里？

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

She stirs, "Hmm…" 她动了动，"嗯……"

"This will be over soon… what are you… going to do then?"  
“这一切很快就会结束……你之后打算做什么？”

Her eyes flicker open suddenly as if I've said something wrong. No, that's just my imagination. I've asked a serious question, so she is probably giving it full attention.  
她的眼睛突然闪烁着睁开，仿佛我说错了什么。不，那只是我的想象。我问了一个严肃的问题，所以她可能正在全神贯注地思考。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"The Angels… they'll… stop right? What are you going to do after that? You're not going to go back to Germany are you?"  
“天使们……他们会……停下来对吧？之后你打算怎么办？不会回德国去吧？”

Again with the sudden movement. She sits up completely and starts looking out the window of the train. Her eyes are darting from building to building.  
又是突然的动作。她完全坐起身来，开始望向火车窗外。她的目光在建筑物间快速移动。

"Asuka, are you alright?"  
“明日香，你还好吗？”

"Shinji… what… what are you talking about?"  
"真嗣…你…你在说什么？"

Something is definitely wrong, incredibly wrong and from the look in her eyes she seems to be realizing it as well. I try to ignore that feeling. Maybe I just said the wrong thing, maybe the idea of the future scares her. Yeah, that has to be it. I glance again at the scars around her eye and arm. I want to ask about them but the potential answer terrifies me. So I do what I do best, I ignore it.  
肯定有什么不对劲，非常不对劲，从她眼中的神情来看，她似乎也在意识到这一点。我试图忽略那种感觉。也许我只是说了不该说的话，也许未来的想法吓到了她。是的，一定是这样。我再次瞥见她眼周和手臂上的伤疤。我想问起它们，但可能的答案让我害怕。所以我做了我最擅长的事，我忽略了它。

"I just… was wondering if you were going to be staying here after this was all over."  
"我只是…想知道这一切结束后，你是否还会留在这里。"

She looks like she's about to get angry, her expression is the same as the Asuka I saw when I was on that beach during the Angel's attack. It's a mixture of fear and anger. I feel myself start to sweat and a feeling of dread lies in the pit of my stomach.  
她看起来马上就要发怒了，那表情和我曾在天使袭击时海滩上见到的明日香如出一辙。那是恐惧与愤怒的混合体。我感到自己开始冒汗，一股不祥的预感在胃里翻腾。

"I… I don't understand… what do you mean what this is all over?"  
“我……我不明白……你说的‘这一切都结束了’是什么意思？”

I pinch my own leg to try to wake myself up from the obvious nightmare yet I don't wake up. This is just like the beach, only that was during an attack from an Angel. This isn't an attack. Fearing the response I'll get I answer her question.  
我掐了掐自己的腿，试图从这明显的噩梦中醒来，然而我并未醒来。这就像那次海滩上的情景，只不过那时是天使的攻击。这次并非攻击。我害怕她的回应，但还是回答了她的提问。

"I mean when the Angel's stop attacking…"  
"我是说当天使停止攻击的时候…"

"Shinji what do you mean, the Angel's stopped attacking. We beat them all remember?"  
“真嗣，你是什么意思，使徒停止攻击了？我们打败了所有使徒，记得吗？”

As she finishes her sentence the train starts to come to a stop. I need to get away from her. This isn't right, I'm going mad. I have to run away, I need to run away.  
她话音刚落，火车开始减速。我必须远离她。这不对劲，我要疯了。我得逃跑，我需要逃跑。

"Come on Shinji, we should go. We'll get you back to the shelter."  
“来吧，真嗣，我们该走了。我们会带你回避难所。”

I shake my head, "This isn't right."  
我摇摇头，"这不对劲。"

"Shinji, we need to go."  
"真嗣，我们得走了。"

She reaches for my hand but I shrug her off. I raise my voice, "No, I… what is this? Who are you?"  
她伸手来抓我的手，但我甩开了她。我提高了声音，“不，我……这是什么？你是谁？”

"Shinji you're just confused, come on we'll get you back to the shelter. It'll be alright."  
"真嗣，你只是有些困惑，来吧，我们带你回避难所。一切都会好起来的。"

The shelter? What shelter? We live with Misato, there isn't a shelter. There never was a shelter. Why is this Asuka haunting me for a second time? Why are those memories coming back into my mind, it wasn't real!  
避难所？什么避难所？我们和美里住在一起，根本没有避难所。从来就没有避难所。为什么这个阿斯纳会再次缠着我？为什么那些记忆又回到我的脑海里，那不是真的！

Yet she looks real, her touch is real and the love I feel for her is real. I feel tears stinging the corners of my eyes. I don't understand this, any of this. Is this because of the attack by that Angel, has it messed up my mind that badly?  
然而她看起来那么真实，她的触感如此真切，我对她的爱也是真切的。我感到泪水刺痛了眼角。这一切我都无法理解。难道是因为那个使徒的攻击，我的脑子被搞得这么乱吗？

"Asuka… what… what's happening?"  
"明日香…怎么…怎么回事？"

"I don't know Shinji." "我不知道，真嗣。"

I feel sick. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.  
我感觉恶心。我能感觉到我的心在胸口怦怦直跳。

"I… I was, I don't understand anything. I… I have to go…"  
“我……我之前，我什么都不明白。我……我得走了……”

I try to pull away from her only for her to tighten her grip on me.  
我试图挣脱她，但她却加大了对我的抓握力度。

"Shinji what are you doi-"  
"真嗣，你在做什么-"

Frantically I yell back at her, "Let go of me! What is this, this isn't…!"  
我疯狂地朝她大喊：“放开我！这是什么，这不是……！”

"I just want to help you Shinji, tell me what's wrong."  
"我只是想帮你，真嗣，告诉我哪里不对劲。"

For a moment I consider it, maybe something is wrong. Maybe I should stay here and tell her what is happening. Maybe she can help. Yet I can't. I have to get out of her, back to Misato's. I'll stay there, I never should have left. Feeling her grip tighten I struggle and finally break away, I shove her forcefully and spin around and head for the train exit. I can hear her yelling my name but I don't turn around, I just keep running off of the platform and away from the train as it pulls away.  
有那么一刻，我考虑了一下，也许有什么不对劲。也许我应该留在这里，告诉她发生了什么。也许她能帮忙。但我做不到。我必须离开她，回到美里那里。我会留在那里，我根本就不该离开。感觉到她的手抓紧了，我挣扎着终于挣脱，用力推开她，转身向列车出口跑去。我能听到她在喊我的名字，但我没有回头，只是继续跑离站台，远离驶离的列车。

Finally I come to a stop and lean against a railing to catch my breath. I feel the tears falling down my face but I don't know why. I don't know what just happened but suddenly everything feels wrong. I feel like I'm wrong, like this place is wrong.  
最终我停了下来，靠在栏杆上喘口气。我感觉到泪水顺着脸颊滑落，但不知道为什么。我不知道刚刚发生了什么，但突然间一切都感觉不对劲。我觉得自己错了，这个地方也错了。

"Ikari…" "碇…"

I jump as the soft voice wrestles me from the ongoing battle in my mind. I turn around and see Ayanami standing there looking at me curiously.  
我被那柔和的声音从脑海中的激战中拉了出来。我转过身，看到绫波站在那里，好奇地看着我。

"Are you alright, you look upset."  
“你还好吗？看起来很不安。”

I nod, "I'm… fine Ayanami I just… something happened but I'm alright now."  
我点点头，“我……没事，绫波，我只是……发生了一些事，但现在没事了。”

I look around the area we're in. This is quite far from Ayanami's apartment.  
我环顾我们所在的地方。这里离绫波的公寓相当远。

"What are you doing out here?"  
“你在这里做什么？”

"I was taking a walk. I was told that it might be good to explore an area of the city other than the school or NERV."  
“我在散步。有人建议我，除了学校或 NERV，探索一下城市的其他区域或许不错。”

"I see…" "我明白了…"

She pauses and looks up at the trees in this area. I've never been here myself. It's one of the few parts of the city that haven't been damaged in the Angel attacks.  
她停下脚步，抬头望向这片区域的树木。我自己从未到过这里。这是城市中少数未在天使袭击中受损的地方之一。

"It is peaceful here." “这里很宁静。”

I nod, "Yes, it is."  
我点头，“是的，确实如此。”

"You should return soon Ikari, Sohryu and Katsuragi are worried about you."  
"你应该尽快回来，碇、惣流和葛城都很担心你。"

I don't mention my altercation with 'Asuka' moments before to her but I imagine she is right. They will probably be worried about me.  
我没有向她提及之前与'明日香'的争执，但我想她是对的。他们可能会为我担心。

"Yeah… I should shouldn't I…"  
"是啊……我应该回去，不是吗……"

I look at her face looking up at the trees and through the trees to the orange sky above. Soon the next Angel will attack, the target will be Ayanami, yet I know the truth about Ayanami. She can be replaced but her replacement won't be this one. She'll be less human than before, a side effect of the new body. I can't let that happen.  
我看着她仰望树梢，透过枝叶望向头顶那片橙色的天空。不久后，下一个使徒将会来袭，目标是绫波，然而我知晓绫波的真相。她可以被替换，但替代者不会是她。新的身体将使她比以往更不像人类，这是新身体的副作用。我不能让这种事发生。

"You're scared…" “你害怕了……”

"You can tell?" “你能看出来？”

She tilts her head quizzically, "Why are you afraid?"  
她疑惑地歪着头，“你为什么害怕？”

I make up something on the spot, I can hardly explain that I know she is potentially going to die.  
我当场编了个理由，实在难以解释我知道她可能会死去。

"I guess… I just wonder how long we've got until the next Angel attacks. How much peace we have left."  
“我想……我只是想知道下一次使徒袭击前我们还有多少时间。我们还能享受多少安宁。”

"I see." "原来如此。"

"I should probably go back now."  
"我应该可能现在回去。"

To my surprise she comes closer to me and shakes her head, "Not yet, it is not yet time."  
令我惊讶的是，她向我靠近并摇了摇头，“还不行，时候未到。”

---

My eyes flicker open suddenly and I find myself staring straight up at the ceiling of my bedroom. Besides me is Asuka, her chest moving peacefully up and down as she sleeps. It was just a dream, all of it was just a strange dream. I sob quietly as tears fall down my face. I don't know why I'm crying, I guess it was all building up. I haven't cried since the Angel attacked me, all those memories swimming around in my mind constantly it's left me numb.  
我的眼睛突然睁开，发现自己直直地盯着卧室的天花板。在我旁边是明日香，她的胸膛平静地上下起伏，正在熟睡。那只是一场梦，所有的一切都只是个奇怪的梦。我轻声啜泣，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。我不知道自己为何哭泣，我想是这一切积压已久。自从被使徒袭击后，我就再也没有哭过，那些记忆不断在脑海中游荡，让我变得麻木。

I sit up and wipe my eyes with the back of my hand and try to be as quiet as I can. Asuka stirs next to me, no doubt awakened by my movements.  
我坐起身，用手背擦了擦眼睛，尽量保持安静。明日香在我旁边动了动，毫无疑问是被我的动作吵醒了。

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

She looks at me and in the dim light of the room can make out that I'm crying.  
她看着我，在昏暗的房间里能看出我在哭泣。

"Oh my god are you alright?"  
“天哪，你还好吗？”

I nod, "Yeah… bad dream and… just everything…"  
我点头，“嗯…噩梦，还有…所有的事…”

"Heh, been holding back have you?"  
“呵呵，一直在忍耐，是吗？”

I wipe my eye again, "I guess so."  
我又擦了擦眼睛，“我想是的。”

"Idiot." "白痴。"

Despite the tears I realize I'm smiling, maybe the weird dream was what I needed to get it out of my system.  
尽管泪水盈眶，我意识到自己在微笑，也许那个奇怪的梦正是我需要的，让我得以释怀。

"How long are you going to be by the way?"  
“顺便问一下，你要待多久？”

I laugh, "Not too long, sorry."  
我笑着回答：“不会太久，抱歉。”

I look across at the other side of the room.  
我环视房间的另一侧。

"Asuka, about the way I've been the past few days… I… I'm sorry…"  
“明日香，关于我这几天以来的行为……我……我很抱歉……”

I feel a fist collide with my arm.  
我感觉一拳打在了我的手臂上。

"Ow!"

"Stupid Shinji, I understand. We all saw what happened, we all know what happened. Your… mind was invaded Shinji… I… we all knew it was going to be hard for you afterwards."  
"笨蛋真嗣，我明白。我们都看到了发生的事，我们都知道发生了什么。你的……心灵被入侵了，真嗣……我……我们都知道这对你来说会很艰难。"

"Y-You did?" "你-你们都知道？"

"Of course you idiot! It would be hard for anyone, I just… I wish I could have done more. I had to let that silver haired idiot handle it. They wouldn't let me near that… what was it called?"  
"当然知道，你这个傻瓜！这对任何人来说都很困难，我只是……我希望我能做得更多。我不得不让那个银发白痴来处理。他们不让我靠近那个……那东西叫什么来着？"

I answer for her, "The Lance Of Longinus?"  
我替她回答，“朗基努斯之枪？”

"Yeah, what sort of delusional moron came up with that name? I swear this organization has some weird God complex."  
“是啊，哪个妄想狂想出这么个名字？我发誓这组织肯定有某种奇怪的上帝情结。”

"Probably my father then."  
“那估计是我父亲了。”

We both laugh, and I feel lighter somehow. Waking up and interacting with Asuka in this way, I just feel better. Even towards the end of the dream I started to feel better. Ayanami in that dream, her presence calmed me. I think it was a way of my mind giving me a push towards getting better. I wipe away another tear.  
我们俩都笑了，不知怎么的，我感觉轻松了许多。以这种方式醒来并与明日香互动，我感到更好了。即使在梦的最后，我也开始感觉好些了。梦中的绫波，她的存在让我平静。我想这是我的心灵在推动我变得更好。我又擦去了一滴泪。

I think about this girl next to me. In that other place it was her who was attacked by the Angel but she had no one afterwards to support her. This time it was me who was attacked and I have support. I feel like I nearly messed that up but they all knew how I would be and they all stayed by my side.  
我思考着躺在我身边的这个女孩。在那个地方，是她被使徒袭击，但之后没有人支持她。这次是我被袭击，而我得到了支持。我感觉自己差点搞砸了，但他们都知道我会怎样，他们都留在了我身边。

I look down at Asuka, she's smiling up at me and as the tears subside I start to feel something else. I roll over and prop myself up on my elbows over her. I lean in and kiss her softly on the lips. I feel myself starting to become more aroused as she kisses me back. Her hand softly caresses my cheek, her fingers stopping near to my eyes to wipe away any remnants of tears left behind.  
我低头看着明日香，她正微笑着看着我，随着泪水消退，我开始感受到其他的东西。我翻身撑起自己，用肘部支撑着身体俯视她。我俯身轻轻地吻了她的唇。随着她回吻我，我感到自己开始变得更加兴奋。她的手温柔地抚摸着我的脸颊，手指停留在我的眼睛附近，擦去了留下的泪痕。

"You got over that quickly…"  
"你这么快就释怀了…"

"I…"

I don't say anything but instead lean in and kiss her on the neck, she moans softly and runs her hands along my back. I kiss her neck more before making my way along her shoulder. I bring my head back and take both of her arms and pin her wrists to the bed just above her head as I lean in.  
我没有说话，而是倾身向前，在她脖子上轻轻一吻，她轻声呻吟，双手沿着我的背部滑动。我又在她脖子上吻了几下，然后顺着她的肩膀吻下去。我把头抬起来，抓住她的双臂，将她的手腕按在床上，就在她头顶上方，同时我俯身靠近。

"Asuka can I…" "明日香，我可以…"

As I get halfway through the question I stop causing her to giggle at me. I've never actually initiated this, usually it's been Asuka. She's usually the one on top, she's usually the one with the confidence to initiate it.  
当我问到一半时突然停下，惹得她对我咯咯笑。我从未真正主动过，通常都是明日香。她通常是主导的那一方，她通常是那个有信心发起的人。

She looks into my eyes and smiles lustfully back at me, "I quite like this semi-aggressive side of you Shinji…"  
她凝视着我的眼睛，淫荡地对我微笑，"我挺喜欢你这种半带侵略性的一面，真嗣……"

I can feel myself blush at her teasing. She knows what I want, from the way her hands are running over me and the way she is moving I know she wants it as well. She's really going to make me ask though isn't she?  
她的挑逗让我不禁脸红。她知道我想要什么，从她的手在我身上游走的方式和她移动的方式，我知道她也想要。她真的要让我开口问，不是吗？

"So… what do you want to do?"  
"那么…你想做什么？"

"Can… Can I make love to you Asuka?"  
"可以…我可以和你做爱吗，明日香？"

She loosens her hand from my grip and again caresses my face bringing it closer to hers before pulling me into a deep kiss.  
她松开了我的手，再次抚摸我的脸颊，将我拉近，然后深深地吻了我。

**Day 24 第 24 天**

It's raining. The Lilin always associate this weather condition with depression and sadness. I don't understand that. For me the rain holds strange kind of beauty to it, the way reflections are cast in the puddles that form of buildings, people and scenery. The feeling of warmth you get when you view it from within a home. The way it feels when you walk through it. The way the water bounces off the hood of a waterproof coat. It pleases me to sit in this café, my personal music player playing the Ode to Joy as I watch the Lilin move past me outside hurrying to their locations.  
外面下着雨。莉林人总是将这种天气与抑郁和悲伤联系在一起。我不理解这一点。对我来说，雨有一种奇异的美感，水洼中映出的建筑、人和景色的倒影。从家中望出去时感受到的温暖。走在雨中的感觉。水珠从防水外套的帽檐上弹开的方式。我喜欢坐在这家咖啡馆里，我的个人音乐播放器正播放着《欢乐颂》，我看着外面的莉林人匆匆走过，赶往各自的目的地。

Sure the rain can bring danger but can the same not be said of the sun too? For someone such as myself with pale skin I'm at risk of burning easily or sunstroke. Yet the Lilin do not tend associate sun with negative feelings.  
当然，雨水可能带来危险，但阳光不也一样吗？像我这样皮肤苍白的人，很容易被晒伤或中暑。然而，莉林人并不倾向于将阳光与负面情绪联系在一起。

I remember an exchange on that fateful day some months ago.  
我记得几个月前那个决定命运的日子里的一段对话。

_'Sunny days make you feel good.'  
'阳光明媚的日子让人心情愉悦。'_

_'Rainy days make you feel gloomy.'  
'阴雨绵绵的日子让人感到忧郁。'_

_'If you are told this is so, then that is what you believe is so.'  
'如果有人告诉你这是真的，那么你就会相信这是真的。'_

_'But you can have fun on a rainy day.'  
'但在雨天也可以找乐子。'_

The Lilin form their truths based on the influence of others. The perception of rain being depressing is etched into their collective consciousness across all cultures and will likely remain. I wonder if maybe there is a Lilin culture on this Earth that perceives things the other way around. They intrigue me and I realize that much like them I am influenced by this collective consciousness. My interest has taught me to question it, therefore I now perceive things the other way around.  
莉林族根据他人的影响形成他们的真理。雨被认为是压抑的观念深深植根于他们所有文化的集体意识中，并且很可能会一直存在。我想知道，也许在这个地球上，是否存在一个莉林文化，他们以相反的方式看待事物。他们引起了我的兴趣，我意识到，就像他们一样，我也受到这种集体意识的影响。我的兴趣教会了我质疑它，因此我现在以相反的方式看待事物。

I bring the cup of tea in front of me to my lips and sip gently from it. I should have waited longer for it to cool down, the sensation whilst drinking it is not pleasant. It burns my lips and tongue. I am still not used to drinking hot liquids such as this.  
我将面前的茶杯举到唇边，轻轻啜饮。本该多等一会儿让它冷却，此刻的口感并不宜人。它烫伤了我的唇舌。我仍不习惯饮用如此滚烫的液体。

A person enters the café and I smile at her arrival. She brings down the hood of her raincoat and her blue hair and pale skin is revealed to me. She turns and spots me and makes her way over to where I am seated.  
有人走进咖啡馆，我对着她的到来微笑。她脱下雨衣的兜帽，露出了蓝色的头发和苍白的肌肤。她转身发现了我，便朝我坐的地方走来。

"Rei Ayanami, I am pleased to see you."  
“绫波零，很高兴见到你。”

She nods, "Yes." 她点头，“是的。”

I forget that despite how alike we are we are not exactly the same. Our births were similar but the paths we took to who we are and who we developed into are quite different. Rei is not able to communicate her emotions as well as I am. She always seems stand offish with people but those who know her know better. Yet despite our differences we are here because we have a common interest, the wellbeing of Asuka Langley Sohryu and Shinji Ikari.  
我忘记了，尽管我们如此相似，却并非完全相同。我们的出生相似，但各自成长为现在的自己，所走的路却大相径庭。丽在表达情感方面不如我擅长。她总是显得与人疏远，但了解她的人知道并非如此。然而，尽管有这些差异，我们聚在这里是因为有一个共同的兴趣——确保明日香·兰格雷和真嗣·碇的幸福。

"Would you like anything?"  
“您需要些什么吗？”

"Tea please." “请来杯茶。”

"Of course." "当然可以。"

I lift the teapot from its place on the table and pour some of it into the empty cup on the table.  
我从桌上拿起茶壶，往桌上的空杯子里倒了一些茶。

"It is an interesting place this, I believe it resembles a tea room from a country called England. I would like to visit sometime. Lilin cultures are fascinating, would you not agree?"  
“这个地方挺有意思的，我觉得它像一个叫英国的国家的茶室。有机会我想去看看。莉莉丝文化很迷人，你不同意吗？”

She takes the cup and adds some milk to it and mixes in some of the sweetener on offer. She then places her hands around the cup, I presume to warm them up.  
她拿起杯子，加了些牛奶，又掺入一些提供的甜味剂。随后，她将双手环绕在杯子上，我想是为了取暖。

"I have not thought about it. I think I would like to see beyond this city one day."  
“我还没想过。我想有一天我会想看看这座城市之外的世界。”

Our eyes meet across the table and at once we both make the same realization. There will most likely not be a 'one day' for either of us. It is sad and perhaps unfortunate but we are lucky to be able to do what we are doing now. I decide to move the subject on to why we are here.  
我们的目光在桌子上相遇，一瞬间我们都意识到了同一件事。对我们中的任何一个来说，很可能都不会有‘那一天’了。这很悲伤，或许也是不幸的，但我们能做现在所做的事情，已是幸运。我决定转移话题，谈谈我们为何会在这里。

"The convergence has begun. The second attempt was last night, just as we expected…"  
“融合已经开始。第二次尝试就在昨晚，正如我们所料……”

She glances down at her tea and begins to stir it. She says nothing for a moment. We both know what this means, that's why we did what we did last night. When the being made its attempt we were able to project ourselves into it.  
她低头看向她的茶，开始搅拌。她沉默了一会儿。我们都知道这意味着什么，这就是为什么我们昨晚做了那些事。当那个存在试图行动时，我们能够将自己投射进去。

Finally she replies, "We were able to bring them together, even if for a brief time. It is just as we planned for our scenario."  
最终她回答道：“我们成功让他们聚在一起，哪怕只是短暂的时间。这正是我们为我们的情景所计划的。”

I can't help but laugh at her choice of words. She sounded just like the man who raised her. Of course she is correct, we had a plan and last night we were able to put it into action.  
我不禁被她的措辞逗笑。她说话的语气简直和她养父如出一辙。当然，她是对的，我们有一个计划，而昨晚我们成功地付诸行动了。

"We probably don't have much time left. Its strength grows day by day and with the imminent arrival of the sixteenth it will likely have enough strength for a full attempt."  
“我们可能剩下的时间不多了。它的力量日益增长，随着第十六日的临近，它很可能将有足够的力量进行全面尝试。”

"You are concerned?" “你在担心吗？”

I nod and give an honest reply, "Yes, when it reaches full strength it will have no more use for Shinji. It will attempt to dispose of him and then it will make its attempt. We will likely have a very short window of opportunity to bring them together. Even then we don't know what it is going to attempt."  
我点头并诚实地回答：“是的，当它达到全盛时，它将不再需要真嗣。它会试图除掉他，然后展开行动。我们可能只有非常短暂的机会让他们聚在一起。即便如此，我们也不知道它究竟会尝试什么。”

She sips from her cup before taking a look outside the window, "I am concerned too but… I believe in the two of them. That is all I need."  
她啜饮了一口杯中的饮料，然后望向窗外，“我也很担心，但是……我相信他们俩。这就足够了。”

I give another smile before finally putting butter on the crumpet in front of me and taking a bite. It's nice, yet another new experience for me today. It is a shame it might be the last time I get to try something like this but I am at peace with that fact.  
我又笑了笑，终于在面前的烤饼上涂上黄油并咬了一口。味道不错，今天又是一个新的体验。遗憾的是，这可能是我最后一次尝试这样的东西了，但我对此心安理得。

Her words have done little to reassure me. I can't tell if she genuinely believes what she has said or if she too is scared and just hiding it really well. I'm admittedly very scared. What we're facing and what Shinji and Asuka will face isn't like before. It's a malicious entity and we don't even know if what we have planned will work.  
她的话并没有让我感到安心。我无法判断她是真的相信自己所说的话，还是她也感到害怕，只是隐藏得很好。我承认自己非常害怕。我们即将面对的，以及真嗣和明日香将要面对的，与以往不同。这是一个恶意的实体，我们甚至不知道我们计划的方案是否有效。

We know we can bring them together, we were able to last night and the time before only the link wasn't as strong then. Will we have the time to explain to them what has happened? Even then will they be able to fight it? Will they even accept what we tell them?  
我们知道我们可以让他们团结起来，昨晚和之前的那次我们做到了，只是那时联系没有那么紧密。我们会有时间向他们解释发生了什么吗？即便如此，他们能与之抗争吗？他们会接受我们告诉他们的事实吗？

"Nagisa…" “渚…”

My mouth still half full I give a muffled response, "Yesh?"  
我的嘴里还含着一半的食物，含糊地回应道：“是吗？”

"Something still concerns you?"  
“还有什么让你担心吗？”

"It is... yes, you are correct. It is not their abilities that I doubt I am just… concerned as to how Shinji will take things when the truth is revealed to him. I am concerned as to how Asuka will take things when the truth is revealed to her. I am concerned that either of them might reject the truth like thye tried to before…"  
“确实……你说得对。我并非怀疑他们的能力，我只是……担心真嗣在得知真相后会如何接受。我也担心明日香在得知真相后会如何反应。我担心他们中的任何一个可能会像之前那样试图拒绝真相……”

"They have grown since that time and things were different. They had not come together at that point, they were both at their lowest. While their hearts still have that fragility they have also been strengthened by their bonds with each other."  
"自那时起，他们已经成长了许多，一切都变得不同了。在那个时刻，他们还未走到一起，都处于最低谷。尽管他们的心仍带着那份脆弱，但彼此间的纽带也赋予了他们力量。"

"So you don't think it'll be a problem?"  
"所以你不认为这会是个问题？"

She shakes her head, "No, I do not. I have complete faith in the two of them."  
她摇了摇头，"不，我不这么认为。我对他们俩完全有信心。"

It is strange having a discussion with Rei Ayanami like this. When we first met we were on opposite sides of the fight. I was an Angel and carried within me the soul of Adam. I was Tabris, the final Angel and enemy of mankind. My human body created from an unknown donor. Rei Ayanami carried within her the soul of Lilith and was created from the remains of Yui Ikari.  
与绫波零这样讨论事情真是奇怪。我们初次相遇时，立场截然相反。我曾是使徒，体内承载着亚当的灵魂。我是塔布里斯，最后的使徒，人类的敌人。我的人类躯体来自一位未知捐赠者。绫波零体内则承载着莉莉丝的灵魂，由碇唯的遗骸创造而成。

When Third Impact occurred we both joined the mass of souls that converged. We helped the two known as Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Sohryu to make their decision to return to this Earth, to put an end to Third Impact and allow humanity to continue. It was a decision I had hoped for, humans need the pain and suffering to progress forward without that they will stagnate.  
当第三次冲击发生时，我们一同融入了汇聚的灵魂之中。我们帮助了被称为碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷的两人，让他们做出决定，重返地球，终结第三次冲击，让人类得以延续。这是我所希望的决定，人类需要痛苦与苦难来推动前进，否则他们将停滞不前。

Then a new Angel appeared. One not born of Adam and Lilith but born of man. It was able to manifest itself within the person known as Shinji Ikari and create this world. We were able to manifest ourselves within it. We observed and we waited for our opportunity to once again guide Shinji and Asuka. We observed everything doing our best to not interfere even though we realized it might hurt Shinji and Asuka when the truth was finally revealed.  
随后，一个新的使徒出现了。它并非亚当与莉莉丝所生，而是人类所孕育。它能在名为碇真嗣的人体内显现，创造出这个世界。我们得以在其中显现。我们观察并等待，寻找再次引导真嗣和明日香的机会。我们尽力不干涉，尽管意识到真相最终揭露时可能会伤害到真嗣和明日香。

Now the time comes when we can reveal ourselves to them and I'm actually scared. If we fail then we lose everything. My former masters somehow win. I can't allow that.  
现在，我们向他们揭示自己的时刻到了，而我真的感到害怕。如果我们失败了，我们将失去一切。我的前主人不知怎的会赢。我不能允许那样的事情发生。

There is a pause and I notice her look at something out of the window, she raises her finger, "It is time."  
她停顿了一下，我注意到她望向窗外，举起手指，“是时候了。”

I look out the window to where she is pointing. In the distance I can see the glowing object. A ring of light, two helixes. Armisael, the sixteenth has arrived.  
我顺着她指的方向望向窗外。在远处，我看到了那个发光物体。一圈光环，两条螺旋。阿米萨埃尔，第十六使徒已经抵达。

---

This is the second to last one, this one is just like the one I was shown. I can see it in the distance rotating slowly. It looks like an angels halo, I suppose this one is really trying to live up to its name. I can hear the chatter from inside the complex. Blood pattern is changing from orange to blue, the Magi can't get a full lock on what it is yet.  
这是倒数第二个使徒，这个和之前展示给我看的一样。我可以看到它在远处缓缓旋转。看起来像天使的光环，我想这个使徒真的在努力配得上它的名字。我能听到基地内部的嘈杂声。血液图案正从橙色变为蓝色，魔术师们还无法完全锁定它的真实身份。

I already know what it is, everyone else does. We don't need a computer to confirm it for us yet we wait for it to happen anyway as if that will make a difference. I look around Tokyo-3 and I see the other three Evangelion Units ready for battle. Everything has changed so much, even with the attack on my mind from the last Angel I'm in such a different place now. Asuka is here, ready to fight. We have Rei in good condition to fight and assistance from Kaworu as well.  
我已经知道它是什么了，其他人也一样。我们不需要电脑来确认，但我们仍然等待着它的发生，仿佛这会有所不同。我环顾第三新东京市，看到其他三台 EVA 机体已准备好战斗。一切都变化太大了，尽管上次使徒对我心灵的攻击，我现在处于一个完全不同的境地。明日香在这里，准备战斗。我们有状态良好的绫波零参战，还有来自渚薰的协助。

I've tried to put what Kaworu is out of my mind for the time being. I have an idea of what I'll do, I'll tell him I know. I'll persuade him to not do what he is going to do. I'll explain how I know and tell him we can fight. He doesn't want to die, I know it. We can all get through this together.  
我暂时把对渚薰的疑虑放在一边。我有一个计划，我会告诉他我知道一切。我会说服他不要做他打算做的事。我会解释我是如何知道的，并告诉他我们可以一起战斗。他不想死，我知道。我们都能一起度过这个难关。

I wonder if my changes have affected things in NERV. I know my father's scenario is going ahead as he planned. He probably doesn't suspect anything is wrong. Misato on the other hand, I know she suspects something. Kaji will have shown her Lilith and they would have spoken whilst they were back together. He's safe now, back in Germany with his sister.  
我想知道我的改变是否影响了 NERV 的局势。我知道我父亲的计划正在按他的预想进行。他大概什么也没察觉到。而美里，我知道她有所怀疑。加持应该已经带她看了莉莉丝，他们重聚时肯定谈过话。现在他安全了，回到了德国，和他的妹妹在一起。

I suppose a major change is Unit 01 didn't acquire the S2 Engine, was that a necessary part of the plan? I can figure that out later. We have to defeat the Angel now.  
我想一个重大的变化是零号机没有获得 S2 引擎，这是计划中必要的一部分吗？这个以后再想吧。我们现在必须击败使徒。

_"What's it doing? This is boring."  
“它在干什么？这真无聊。”_

_"Stay calm Asuka, we haven't confirmed it's an Angel yet."  
“保持冷静，明日香，我们还没确认那是使徒。”_

Asuka gives a sharp laugh, _"Oh come on! We don't need a supercomputer to confirm that's an Angel. Strange glowing ring appears on the outskirts of the city, no one knows what it is? Of course it's an Angel."_  
明日香发出一声尖锐的笑声，“哦，拜托！我们不需要超级计算机来确认那是使徒。城市边缘出现奇怪的发光环，没人知道它是什么？当然是使徒了。”

A smile crosses my face, she is of course right. We all know it, so why are we waiting?  
我脸上露出了微笑，她当然是对的。我们都知道，那为什么还要等待呢？

Suddenly the ring stops moving, it uncoils itself into a single strand and starts heading towards us. I hear the panic over the radio instantly.  
突然间，那环停止了移动，它自行解开成一条单股，开始朝我们这边移动。我立刻从无线电中听到了恐慌的声音。

_"Pattern Blue confirmed, pilots to your stations. Weaken its A.T. Field with fire."  
“确认蓝色模式，飞行员各就各位。用火力削弱它的 A.T.力场。”_

Instantly we all aim our rifles towards the oncoming Angel. The sound is deafening as four Evangelion's unleash a barrage of bullets towards the snake-like entity hurtling towards us. I see the flash of light as the bullets collide with its A.T. Field. A layer of dust and smoke goes up as we stop our barrage.  
我们立刻将所有步枪对准迎面而来的使徒。随着四台福音战士同时发射密集的子弹，声音震耳欲聋。我看到子弹撞击其 A.T.力场时发出的闪光。一阵尘埃和烟雾升起，我们停止了射击。

Like a well-oiled machine we all stand and retreat through a few of the city blocks. Once in our new positions we all discharge the plugs in our Unit's and put in fresh new ones that have just risen in our vicinity.  
我们如同润滑良好的机器，全体起立并撤退穿过几个街区。一旦到达新位置，我们便卸下单位中的旧插头，换上刚在我们附近升起的新鲜插头。

We all take aim again towards the Angel but none of us fire. As the dust settles we see nothing. The Angel is nowhere to be seen. I call out on the radio.  
我们再次瞄准天使，但无人开火。尘埃落定后，我们什么也没看到。天使不见踪影。我通过无线电呼叫。

"Did, Did we get it?"  
“我们，我们击中它了吗？”

_"Of course we did idiot! It wasn't going to stand a chance against four Evangelions wa-"  
"当然是我们干的，笨蛋！它怎么可能在四台福音战士面前有胜算呢-"_

Asuka's celebrations are cut short by Nagisa's yell over the system.  
明日香正要庆祝，却被渚在系统中的喊声打断。

"IKARI WATCH OUT!" "碇，小心！"

I turn to my left to see the Angel hurtling towards me. I stumble back trying to dodge out of the its way and feel it hit me directly in the shoulder. It attaches itself to my shoulder. I scream out in agony as I feel it trying to bury itself into my Eva's shoulder and by extension into me. The pain is like a burning, pressing itself into my arm. With my free arm I try to reach for the prog knife.  
我转向左边，看到天使正向我疾冲而来。我踉跄后退，试图避开它的路径，却感到它直接击中了我的肩膀。它附着在我的肩膀上。我痛苦地尖叫，感觉到它正试图埋入我的 Eva 的肩膀，进而侵入我。那疼痛如同燃烧般，压迫着我的手臂。我用空着的手臂试图去拿进度刀。

At the same time I can hear Misato shouting over the radio.  
与此同时，我能听到美里在无线电中大喊。

"GET IN THERE AND HELP HIM!"  
“冲进去帮他！”

There is a pause, I finally grab the knife and bring it down on the Angel. I'm dazzled by light as the knife makes contact with the A.T. Field. I grit my teeth and focus on trying to break through the field rather than the pain I'm in.  
一阵沉默后，我终于抓住了刀，向使徒砍去。刀刃触及 A.T.力场时，我被光芒晃得眼花缭乱。我咬紧牙关，专注于突破力场，而非身上的疼痛。

"Nagisa I'm sending you the Dual Saw! Asuka and Rei, us your knives to try and get it out of there!"  
渚，我传给你双重锯！明日香和丽，用你们的刀试着把它弄出来！

A collective "Right" is sent through the voice chatter as I continue to try to break through the Angel's A.T. Field. I can start to feel it penetrate the armour of my Eva and break through to the humanoid inside. I daren't look down at my shoulder. I know what it will look like, I know the veins will have appeared from it trying to invade my body. It's just like it did to Rei but that time she was alone, I won't let that happen! We won't let that happen! We will beat it!  
通讯中传来一致的“明白”声，我继续努力突破使徒的 A.T.力场。我能感觉到它在穿透 EVA 的装甲，触及内部的人形。我不敢低头看肩膀。我知道它会是什么样子，我知道血管会因为试图侵入我的身体而显现。就像它对丽做过的那样，但那次她孤身一人，我不会让那种事发生！我们不会让那种事发生！我们会打败它！

In the distance I see Rei approaching in Unit 00, he knife drawn. In a swift motion she grabs hold of the Angel and starts trying to slice into it. Without any warning the Angel suddenly withdraws itself from me. Using its body it knocks me onto my back. I clench and unclench my hand and feel it slowly coming back to life.  
远处，我看到零号机中的丽正手持利刃逼近。她迅速抓住使徒，开始试图切割。没有任何预警，使徒突然从我身边撤离，用其身体将我击倒在地。我紧握又松开手掌，感觉到它正慢慢恢复活力。

The Angel is now floating above us, just out of reach for any of our weapons.  
使徒现在悬浮在我们上方，超出了我们所有武器的攻击范围。

_"No fair! It knows it can't win so it goes where we can't hit it!"  
“这不公平！它知道自己赢不了，就躲到我们打不到的地方！”_

It suddenly starts moving again, this time heading straight towards the white winged Evangelion piloted by Kaworu. With barely any effort he dodges out of its way and brings his dual saw down upon the Angel as it passes him. He meets nothing but its A.T. Field.  
它突然再次动了起来，这次直奔驾驶着白色羽翼的 Evangelion 的渚薰。他几乎不费吹灰之力就避开了它的路径，并在它经过时用双锯向天使砍去。他遇到的只是它的 A.T.力场。

It moves past him and swings around again, this time it's caught by both the dual saw and Unit 02's progressive knife. Again all she hits is the A.T. Field of the Angel.  
它从他身边掠过，再次转身，这次被双锯和 02 号机的渐进刀同时击中。然而，她击中的只是天使的 A.T.力场。

_"Damnit for something like looks like a strand of spaghetti this is one tough bastard!"  
“该死，这家伙看起来像根面条，却是个硬茬子！”_

Slowly I stumble to my feet and watch as it hovers in the air for a time before swinging around again and pointing itself directly towards Rei. It begins to accelerate towards her and I yell out and run towards Unit 00.  
我缓缓站起身，看着它在空中悬浮片刻，随即再次转向，直指丽。它开始加速向她冲去，我大喊一声，向零号机跑去。

"AYANAMI!" “绫波！”

I manage to shove Unit 00 out of the way just in time to watch it fly overhead. It doesn't stop but instead swings back around and heads straight towards…  
我及时将零号机推开，眼看着它从头顶飞过。它并未停下，而是再次转向，直奔……

My eyes widen as I watch it head straight towards Unit 02. Kaworu tries to get in the way but it moves faster than it had done previously. Asuka tries to move Unit 02 out of the way but it unable to do so as I watch the Angel slam directly into the chest of Unit 02. It forces itself through the armour plating and the sound of Asuka's scream fills out radio.  
我的眼睛瞪大了，看着它径直冲向 02 号机。渚薰试图挡在前面，但它移动得比之前更快。明日香试图让 02 号机避开，但却动弹不得，我眼睁睁看着使徒猛烈撞击 02 号机的胸膛。它强行穿透了装甲板，明日香的尖叫声通过无线电响彻四周。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

I run towards toward the Angel but just as I reach it I run directly into an A.T. Field. It wasn't this strong before. We can all hear Asuka screaming over the radio.  
我朝使徒跑去，但就在我接近时，直接撞上了一个 A.T.力场。它之前没有这么强。我们都能听到明日香在无线电中的尖叫声。

_"I-It's… trying to…" “我-它…正试图…”_

_"AYANAMI, NAGISA, SHINJI TRY TO GET THROUGH THAT A.T. FIELD, SAVE HER!"  
“绫波、渚、真嗣，突破那 A.T.力场，救她！”_

Misato yells to us frantically as I see Unit 02 writhe in pain from the attack. It's trying to pull the Angel out of its chest. I hammer at the large A.T. Field with the knife trying desperately to break through.  
美里焦急地对我们喊道，我看到 2 号机因攻击而痛苦挣扎。它正试图将使徒从胸口拉出。我拼命用刀敲击着巨大的 A.T.力场，试图突破。

A storm of bullets collide with the field from Ayanami. I see Kaworus Unit next to me trying to rbeak through the field as well. I can see still Unit 02 struggling ahead of me.  
绫波的子弹风暴撞击着力场。我看到一旁的卡洛斯也在努力突破。我仍能看到前方的 2 号机在挣扎。

_"It's… It's trying to get inside of me! It's…"  
"它……它想进入我体内！它……"_

I scream out and keep forcing the knife forward.  
我尖叫着，继续用力推进刀子。

_'Come on you bastard, please… please get through… please! Mother… help me!'  
'来吧，你这个混蛋，求你了……求你穿过去……求你了！妈妈……救我！'_

_"I… I can't! I…" "我…我做不到！我…"_

"Asuka! We're coming for you… we'll rescue you just…"  
"明日香！我们来了…我们会救你的…"

I let out a roar as I push forward one more time. I have to push through this field. There are three Evangelion's here, we have to do it. We can do it. I look up as I see the Angel suddenly grow rigid, in mere seconds it fully enters Unit 02.  
我怒吼一声，再次奋力向前。我必须穿过这片领域。这里有三个福音战士，我们一定能做到。我们能做到。我抬头望去，只见那使徒突然僵住，短短几秒内完全进入了二号机体内。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

I hear Misato suddenly come over the radio.  
我听到美里突然从无线电中传来声音。

_"What is she doing? Oh my god she's inverting her A.T. Field! Asuka!"  
“她在做什么？天哪，她在反转自己的 A.T.力场！明日香！”_

The Angels A.T. Field suddenly drops and I begin to rush forward only to find myself tackled to the ground by Kaworu in his Eva.  
使徒的 A.T.力场突然消失，我正要冲上前去，却被真嗣在 Eva 中的身影扑倒在地。

_"SHINJI! You can't! You'll die if you do!"  
"真嗣！你不能！你这么做会死的！"_

I struggle against him but he overpowers me and keeps me held down.  
我挣扎着反抗他，但他力量太大，把我牢牢按住。

"No! I have to! I have to Asuka!"  
"不！我必须这么做！我必须为了明日香！"

I can't move, all I can do is watch as Unit 02 escapes to the edge of the city. I can barely see any of the Angel's body as Unit 02 is beginning to be encased in a glowing white light. I still can't move, Kaworu has me pinned to the ground.  
我动弹不得，只能眼睁睁看着二号机逃到城市的边缘。随着二号机开始被一层耀眼的白光包裹，我几乎看不见使徒的身体了。我依旧无法动弹，渚薰将我按在地上。

Finally Unit 02 comes to a stop. A private message comes in on the communications system. I'm greeted by Asuka. I can see the veins of where the Angel is taking over her body all over her but she's wearing a defiant and beautiful smile.  
最终，二号机停了下来。通讯系统中传来一条私人消息。我看到了明日香。她身上遍布着被使徒侵占的血管，但她却带着一种倔强而美丽的微笑。

_"Hah… I guess… I guess this is it Shinji…"  
“哈……我想……我想这就是终点了，真嗣……”_

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

She brings up a hand to her eyes, _"Look at that… Tears… I'm actually crying… how disgusting, to go out like that…"_  
她举起手遮住双眼，“看那…泪水…我居然在哭…真是恶心，就这样结束…”

I can't say anything but her name, "Asuka…"  
我只能说她的名字，“明日香…”

_"I… You know Shinji, you actually made me happy. I never thought I'd be happy nor did I think I deserved to be. You really helped me, you made the shadows in the night go away for a time. You made the nightmares go away. I just… I love you Shinji."  
“我…你知道吗，真嗣，你真的让我感到快乐。我从没想过自己会快乐，也不觉得自己配得上。你真的帮了我，你让夜晚的阴影暂时消散。你赶走了噩梦。我只是…我爱你，真嗣。”_

"I… I love you too Asuka."  
"我…我也爱你，明日香。"

_"Hey… do you think I'll see Mama again?"  
"嘿…你觉得我还能再见到妈妈吗？"_

With those words it finally happens. Unit 02 is now fully engulfed in light followed by the deafening sounds of the cross shaped explosion that follows. Its peak almost reaches up to the clouds above, and then it's gone. She's gone.  
随着这些话音落下，一切终于发生了。零二号机完全被光芒吞没，紧接着是震耳欲聋的十字形爆炸声。爆炸的顶端几乎触及了上方的云层，然后一切消失。她消失了。

### Chapter 22 Convergence Level2
**Day 25 第 25 天**

Slowly I open my eyes and find myself in darkness, all the light I have is entering from the lights in the hallway outside. Against the wall I can make out the NERV logo. This is a cell. I don't remember how I got here. All I can remember is Asuka.  
我缓缓睁开双眼，发现自己置身于一片黑暗之中，唯一的光线来自走廊外的灯光。靠墙处，我辨认出了 NERV 的标志。这里是一间牢房。我不记得自己是如何来到这里的。我只记得明日香。

A part of me hopes that it was just a bad dream but the pain in my shoulder tells me otherwise. The fight against that Angel actually happened and now Asuka is dead. She is gone and once again I am alone. Where did I go wrong? I thought for sure I could change things and give myself, no us all a chance to be happy. I thought what I was shown in that other world was a lesson on what would happen if I didn't act. So when I woke up here I was amazed that I had a second chance. So I acted and somehow despite my efforts I made things worse.  
我内心的一部分希望这只是一个噩梦，但肩上的疼痛告诉我并非如此。与那只使徒的战斗确实发生了，而现在明日香已经死去。她走了，我又一次孤身一人。我究竟哪里做错了？我曾确信自己能改变一切，给自己，不，给我们所有人一个幸福的机会。我以为在那个平行世界所见的一切是关于如果我不采取行动将会发生什么的教训。所以当我在这里醒来时，我惊讶地发现自己有了第二次机会。于是我行动了，尽管我尽了全力，却让事情变得更糟。

Where did I go wrong? What could I have done differently? The sad truth is none of that matters now, she's gone. The girl I loved is dead and I'm alone. Soon it will be time for the final Angel and after that SEELE will attack NERV. I'm supposed to stop Kaworu, I was going to but I can't now. I can't go forward without Asuka.  
我究竟哪里做错了？我本可以做些什么不同的事？可悲的事实是，现在这些都不重要了，她已经离去。我深爱的女孩已经死去，而我孤身一人。不久后，最终的使徒将会到来，随后 SEELE 将攻击 NERV。我本应阻止渚薰，我曾打算这么做，但现在我做不到了。没有明日香，我无法继续前行。

Even if I wanted to I couldn't. I'm in this cell and I don't know why. I don't remember anything after seeing Asuka self-destruct like that.  
即便我想，我也做不到。我被困在这牢房里，不知为何。看到明日香那样自毁后，我什么都不记得了。

It's so strange how I feel right now. I realize I don't feel sad, I just feel empty. Completely and utterly empty, I can't even cry. Why can't I cry? Why can't I bring myself to do so? I want to but all I can do is stare blankly at the wall in front of me.  
此刻的感觉真是奇怪。我意识到自己并不感到悲伤，只是空虚。彻底而绝对的空虚，我甚至哭不出来。为什么我哭不出来？为什么我无法让自己这样做？我想哭，但我所能做的只是茫然地盯着面前的墙壁。

I hear a noise outside my cell door, footsteps. There is a noise and the door slides open. Light enters the room and I see a familiar shadow cast on the floor. It's him, it's Kaworu. I suppose it's time for him to descend to Terminal Dogma soon.  
我听到牢房门外有声响，是脚步声。接着门滑开了，光线照进房间，我看到地板上投下一个熟悉的影子。是他，是渚薰。我想，他很快就要前往最终教条区了。

I don't care what happens anymore. Without her there is no point.  
我不在乎还会发生什么。没有她，一切都没有意义。

"Hello Shinji…" “你好，真嗣…”

"I know what you are, go ahead and do it. I won't stop you."  
“我知道你是什么，尽管做吧。我不会阻止你。”

"Get up." "起来。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"We have something to discuss."  
"我们有事要谈。"

I think back to the last battle, Kaworu held me down so I could go to Asuka. If could have saved her if he hadn't have done that. Couldn't I?  
我回想起上一场战斗，渚薰按住了我，让我能去到明日香身边。如果他没有那样做，我本可以救她的。不是吗？

No… I couldn't. There was nothing I could have done. A part of me wants to be angry at Kaworu for doing what he did but much like I'm unable to cry I can't be angry either. I can't be anything.  
不……我做不到。我无能为力。我的一部分想要对渚薰所做的事感到愤怒，但就像我无法哭泣一样，我也无法愤怒。我什么也做不了。

I turn my head and I see him standing in the door way, his hands tucked into his pockets. He isn't wearing his usual smile. Instead I see something else, a grim expression. His eyes don't have the same light they usually do. His tone of voice isn't the same as usual.  
我转过头，看到他站在门口，双手插在口袋里。他没有像往常那样微笑。相反，我看到了另一种表情，严肃的神情。他的眼睛里没有平时那种光芒。他的语调也与平时不同。

It doesn't matter to me though. I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to be forced to kill him. He can have whichever Eva he wants and take it down to see Lilith. He can end it all for all I care.  
但这些对我来说都无所谓。我不会这么做，我不会被迫去杀他。他可以拥有任何他想要的 Eva，带它去见莉莉丝。他可以结束这一切，我不在乎。

"I don't care anymore, just take the Eva and do what you're supposed to do. You'll have no resistance. I'm the only one who can stop you right? So just… give up trying to be my friend. I know you're the last Angel."  
“我再也不在乎了，把 Eva 拿去，做你该做的事。你不会遇到任何抵抗。我是唯一能阻止你的人，对吧？所以，别再试图做我的朋友了。我知道你是最后一个使徒。”

I see his lips turn upwards into the hint of a smile, "Yes. Yes you do don't you? You've known from the time my name was announced haven't you?"  
我看到他的嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝微笑，“是的。你确实知道，对吧？从宣布我的名字那一刻起，你就知道了，对吧？”

Our eyes meet and my mouth opens in surprise. He was aware that I knew he was an Angel? How?  
我们的目光相遇，我惊讶地张开了嘴。他知道我知道他是使徒？怎么可能？

"I am afraid however that you misinterpret my reason for being here. I am not here to try to end your world, nor am I here to betray you. I'm here to help you. Now get up Shinji Ikari, we are running out of time."  
"恐怕你误解了我来此的原因。我不是来终结你们的世界，也不是来背叛你们。我是来帮助你的。现在站起来，碇真嗣，我们时间不多了。"

---

It happened again yesterday. Only for a short time but it was enough to confirm that the Angel has grown more powerful. They still can't do anything about it. It doesn't have a physical form yet it's inside Shinji, doing something to him. All I can do is stand-by and watch. I've never felt so powerless in my life. Even the time I couldn't pilot my Eva doesn't compare to this. With each moment it seems closer and closer to eventually losing him.  
昨天又发生了。虽然只是短暂的一刻，但足以证实天使变得更加强大了。他们仍然无计可施。它尚未拥有实体，却潜藏在真嗣体内，对他做着什么。我能做的只有旁观。我一生中从未感到如此无助。就连那次无法驾驶 Eva 的经历也无法与此相比。每一刻，它似乎都离最终夺走他更近一步。

Why does this world have to be so unfair? Just when I thought I was finding happiness, just when we both thought we were finding happiness it's ripped away from us in an instant. Are we not allowed to be happy? Or is this some sort of payback for our sins? Shinji always felt that Third Impact was our punishment and maybe he was wrong. Maybe we were yet to suffer our punishment for what we did.  
为什么这个世界必须如此不公？就在我以为自己找到了幸福，就在我们都以为找到了幸福时，它却在瞬间被夺走。难道我们不配拥有幸福吗？还是这是对我们罪行的某种偿还？真嗣总是觉得第三次冲击是我们的惩罚，也许他错了。也许我们还未承受完我们所做之事的惩罚。

I look on and notice a slight blip on one of the machines. Another one beeps and my heart instantly speeds up as I see Shinji's body twitch. I quickly run towards the door and yell out.  
我环顾四周，注意到一台机器上出现了轻微的异常。另一台机器随即发出哔哔声，我心跳立刻加速，因为看到真嗣的身体抽搐了一下。我迅速冲向门口，大声呼喊。

"Something is happening to Shinji! Get help!"  
“真嗣出事了！快来帮忙！”

I hear one of the guards say something followed by the clatter of footsteps. I quickly rush back to his bedside and take his hand. I watch as other parts of his body start to twitch. The machines are making more noise, the read-outs make no sense.  
我听到一名守卫说了些什么，紧接着是急促的脚步声。我迅速回到他的床边，握住他的手。我注视着他的其他部位也开始抽搐。机器的噪音越来越大，显示屏上的数据变得毫无意义。

"Shinji, help will be here soon! Just… stay with me alright, it'll all be over."  
"真嗣，救援马上就到！就……和我待在一起，好吗？一切都会过去的。"

I try to sound as calm as I can but I'm terrified. I don't know what is happening right now, the machines in the room are constantly making noise and all I can hear is the incessant beeping from them.  
我尽力保持镇定，但内心无比恐惧。我不知道现在发生了什么，房间里的机器不停地发出噪音，我只能听到它们持续不断的哔哔声。

I look towards the door. No one has come yet, no sign of Fuyutsuki or Misato or anyone else. What is taking them so long?  
我望向门口。还没有人来，没有看到冬月副司令、美里或任何其他人。他们怎么这么慢？

Releasing my grip on Shinji's hand I go over to the door to look out into the corridor. I try to open it. The doors locked? I don't remember locking it! I look down at the lock itself to try to unlock it but see it's in the open position. Is the door stuck? I try opening it again using a bit more force this time but the door doesn't open. I angrily throw my fist at the door and look out the small window.  
我松开握着真嗣的手，走到门口向外张望。我试着开门。门锁了？我不记得锁过它！我低头看向锁本身，试图解锁，却发现它处于开启状态。门卡住了吗？我再次用力尝试开门，但门依旧纹丝不动。我愤怒地朝门挥拳，透过小窗户向外看。

I find myself looking out into complete darkness. What the fuck is happening? Why is no one coming to the room? Why is it dark out there? Are we being attacked?  
我发现自己正望向一片漆黑。这他妈到底怎么回事？为什么没人来房间？为什么外面一片黑暗？我们被攻击了吗？

"Come on! What the hell is going on?"  
“快点！到底发生了什么鬼事？”

I yell out and drive my fist against the door again, pain shoots down my hand and arm and I step back. Suddenly the noise of the machines is gone. I straighten myself up and a feeling creeps over me that that might not be a good thing. I can sense something there, something else is in the room besides me and Shinji. Is it the Angel?  
我大喊一声，再次用拳头猛击门板，疼痛沿着手和手臂蔓延，我后退了几步。突然间，机器的噪音消失了。我挺直身子，一种不祥的预感悄然袭来。我能感觉到那里有东西，除了我和真嗣之外，房间里还有别的存在。是使徒吗？

"I hope you know who I am, I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu. Evangelion Pilot and saviour of this world. I've already kicked a number of your friend asses and I won't hesitate to kick yours too. So you'd better leave Shinji alone!"  
“我希望你知道我是谁，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。福音战士驾驶员，这个世界的救星。我已经教训了你不少朋友的屁股，也不介意再教训你一顿。所以你最好别碰真嗣！”

As the words fall out of my mouth I realize how stupid I sound but that's me isn't it? I've always been able to talk big. When I was an Eva pilot I could usually back it up, I don't think I can now.  
话一出口，我就意识到自己听起来有多蠢，但这不就是我吗？我总是能说大话。作为 Eva 驾驶员时，我通常能用行动证明，现在我觉得我可能做不到。

Slowly I turn around preparing myself for the worst. I take my time and out of the corner of my eye I start to see it. Floating above Shinji. A black mist-like entity floating half a metre above him. Solid black tendrils hang down from it seemingly attached to various parts of Shinji's body. The tendirls are solid and have a strange black and white pattern on them. Similar to the twelfth Angel.  
我缓缓转身，准备迎接最坏的情况。我放慢脚步，用眼角余光开始察觉到它的存在。悬浮在真嗣上方。一团黑色雾状实体，悬浮在他上方半米处。从它身上垂下坚实的黑色触须，似乎连接着真嗣身体的各个部位。这些触须坚实且带有奇特的黑白图案，与第十二使徒相似。

Insanity threatens to engulf me as I look at it. I want to rush forward and try to prise the tendrils from Shinji. Maybe then he can wake up. I'm about to take a step forward but just as I do the being starts to move. There is a bright glow and suddenly I hear the door open. A hand grabs my wrist and a familiar voice calls to me.  
疯狂的念头威胁着要将我吞噬，当我凝视着它时。我想冲上前去，试图将触须从真嗣身上剥离。也许那样他就能醒来。我正要向前迈出一步，但就在这时，那个存在开始移动。一道明亮的光芒闪现，突然我听到门被打开。一只手抓住我的手腕，一个熟悉的声音呼唤着我。

"Sohryu, we must go." “惣流，我们必须离开。”

I'm pulled out of the room by this person. I look up in complete shock as I run trying to keep up with the person. Her blue hair, school uniform and pale skin… I can't be mistaken.  
我被这个人拉出了房间。我一边跑一边抬头，完全震惊了。她的蓝发、校服和苍白的皮肤……我不可能认错。

"Wondergirl?" “奇迹女孩？”

---

Kaworu's hand is warm as he pulls and leads me through the maze of corridors to our destination. He has said nothing from the moment he came into the cell and picked me up by force. It was just like when Misato had to drag me, only Kaworu didn't yell at me. Somehow that makes it worse.  
渚薰的手温暖而有力，他拉着我在迷宫般的走廊中穿行，前往目的地。从他进入牢房强行把我带走的那一刻起，他就一言不发。这就像当初美里不得不拖着我走一样，只是渚薰没有对我大喊大叫。不知为何，这反而更糟糕。

As we walk through the corridors I realize with some fear that I don't know where we are. I thought we were in the NERV cells but I've been in them before, the corridors aren't like this in NERV. This is somewhere else.  
当我们穿过走廊时，我带着几分恐惧意识到自己并不知道我们在哪里。我原以为我们在 NERV 的牢房里，但我以前去过那里，NERV 的走廊不是这样的。这里是另一个地方。

"W-Where are we?" “我-我们在哪儿？”

"Somewhere that should not exist."  
“一个本不该存在的地方。”

He turns his head to me as we speak and gives me what I presume is a reassuring smile, "Do not worry. We will reach our destination soon."  
他转头对我说，脸上挂着我猜想是安慰的微笑，“别担心，我们很快就会到达目的地。”

Soon turns out to be another ten minutes. We finally reach a small room, there is a window on the other side of it looking out into the cage. I can see Unit 01 sitting there, its eyes staring back at me. Inside the room itself is sparse and appears to be a bedroom, no an apartment. I know this place. In the corner is a radio playing a song, one that I recognize. Asuka and I listened to this a few times.  
‘很快’实际上又过了十分钟。我们终于到达了一个小房间，对面窗户可以看到笼子。我看见零一号机坐在那里，眼睛回望着我。房间内部陈设简单，看起来像是个卧室，不，更像是个公寓。我认得这个地方。角落里有一台收音机播放着一首我熟悉的歌曲，我和明日香曾一起听过几次。

_'You can't run away forever,  
"“你不能永远逃避，”  
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start'  
但早些开始并没有什么不好。_

Kaworu leads me inside the room and sits me down on the bed. He immediately goes over to the small kettle and begins to make something.  
渚薰带我进入房间，让我坐在床上。他立刻走到小水壶旁，开始准备些什么。

"I am afraid I am only familiar with making only one form of Lilin tea, so the English standard will have to do. This is where I would ask you how you would take it."  
“恐怕我只熟悉制作一种人类茶，所以只能用英国标准了。通常我会问你希望怎么喝。”

I stare at him as he awaits my response. How can he talk to me like this? What the hell is happening right now? None of this makes any sense. Finally I give him my response. My voice laced with as much venom as I can muster. I probably sound like a petulant child.  
我盯着他，等待我的回应。他怎么能这样跟我说话？这到底是怎么回事？这一切都毫无意义。最后，我给了他我的回答。我的声音里充满了尽可能多的恶意。我可能听起来像个任性的孩子。

"Milk… I guess, with sugar."  
“牛奶……我想，加糖。”

I bring my knees up to my chest and watch as he makes the tea in silence. Four cups are set out, one for me, one for him. I wonder who the other two cups are for. I hear the door open and look towards the corridor to see who it is. Rei enters the room. She immediately walks over to Kaworu and I hear her speak to him.  
我抱膝而坐，看着他在沉默中泡茶。摆出了四个杯子，一个给我，一个给他。我不知道另外两个杯子是为谁准备的。我听到门开了，朝走廊望去，看看是谁。丽走进房间。她立刻走向薰，我听到她对他说话。

"It is done, she has been retrieved."  
"已经完成了，她已经被带回来了。"

She has been retrieved? Who is she talking about? When did Kaworu and Rei become friends? They were aware of who one another was but they were on opposite sides. Kaworu smiles again.  
她被带回来了？她在说谁？卡罗和丽什么时候成了朋友？他们虽然知道彼此的身份，但立场却是对立的。卡罗再次微笑。

"Good, I will go and attend to her then."  
"很好，那我就去照顾她了。"

He brings the tea over to me and sets it down on the small bedside table. He kneels down and grabs my hand. His hand is so warm and soft, it's reassuring in a way.  
他把茶端到我面前，放在小床头柜上。他跪下来，握住我的手。他的手温暖而柔软，给人一种安心的感觉。

"Shinji… what is about to happen, will be hard to take in. I'm sorry all of this has had to happen in this way. If there had been another way we would have done it but there wasn't."  
“真嗣……即将发生的事情，可能会很难接受。我很抱歉这一切不得不以这种方式发生。如果有其他办法，我们一定会采取的，但没有。”

"What… I don't understand… what do you mean?"  
“什么……我不明白……你指的是什么？”

He offers me no response but he does finally release my hand. Now he turns towards Rei.  
他没有回应我，但最终还是松开了我的手。现在他转向了丽。

"I will go and see to the Second. How is she?"  
“我去看看二公主。她怎么样了？”

"Confused and angry, as we expected."  
“困惑且愤怒，正如我们所料。”

"Good. We need that." "好。我们需要那个。"

He walks back to the remaining cups and puts two of them on a tray before starting to leave but before he does he turns to me one last time, "Farewell Shinji Ikari, we will see each other again."  
他走回剩下的杯子前，拿起其中两个放在托盘上，正要离开时，他最后一次转向我，"再见了，碇真嗣，我们还会再见面的。"

He leaves and I'm left reeling over their conversation. They said she and they said 'The Second', is… is Asuka alive?  
他离开了，而我还在为他们的对话感到震惊。他们提到了她，还有他们说的'第二人'，难道……明日香还活着？

"Rei… what did he mean when he said The Second?"  
"丽…他说的‘第二’是什么意思？"

Her response comes swiftly but delivered in her usual manner, "Nagisa was referring to Sohryu. She is waiting in a location close to this."  
她迅速回应，但依旧保持着平时的语气，“渚指的是惣流。她正在附近的一个地方等待。”

I immediately stand up. I can't believe it. Asuka is actually alive! She is nearby! I have to go and see her, I don't understand it but I don't care. She is actually alive!  
我立刻站起身来。简直难以置信。明日香竟然还活着！她就在附近！我必须去见她，虽然我不明白这一切，但这些都不重要。她真的还活着！

"Asuka! She's alive? I want to see her!"  
"明日香！她还活着？我想见她！"

Rei's reflexes are too fast for me and she pushes me back down, "No, not yet. It would be too much of a risk right now. Not until you've had the truth explained to you."  
丽反应太快，把我推了回去，“不，现在还不行。风险太大了。在你了解真相之前，不行。”

---

I don't know what is happening anymore, I'm no longer in the facility but we never left the facility. All I remember was Rei pulling me out of that room leading through a maze of corridors before bringing me into this room. This is all wrong, the room is like one of the old apartments meant for the contractors in Tokyo-3 but one the far wall is a window looking out onto a platform. The platform contains Unit 02.  
我不知道发生了什么，我不再在设施里，但我们从未离开过设施。我只记得丽把我从那个房间拉出来，穿过迷宫般的走廊，带我来到这个房间。一切都错了，这个房间像是东京-3 里供承包商住的老式公寓，但远处的墙上有扇窗户，窗外是一个平台。平台上是二号机。

I feel sick as I see Unit 02 for the first time since Third Impact. It makes no sense, it was destroyed. It shouldn't be here yet I can't deny the truth. I never expected to ever see it again outside of my dreams and nightmares. Last time I was in that I died, those bastards stabbed me through the eye, they split my arm in half before impaling the rest of my body. They then ate the Eva alive.  
当我自第三次冲击后首次见到 02 号机时，我感到一阵恶心。这说不通，它明明已经被摧毁了。它不该出现在这里，然而我却无法否认眼前的事实。我从未想过会在梦境和噩梦之外再次见到它。上次我驾驶它时，我死了，那些混蛋刺穿了我的眼睛，将我的手臂劈成两半，然后贯穿了我的身体。他们活生生地吞噬了 Eva。

All the scars on my body are a permanent reminder of that. I never wanted to see this again, I had hoped we'd never see an Eva again. I place my hand on the window and whisper to myself.  
我身上的每一道伤疤都是那段经历的永久印记。我从未想过要再次面对这一切，我曾希望我们永远不会再见到 Eva。我把手放在窗户上，轻声自语。

"Mama…" “妈妈……”

I hear the door open behind me and I turn around and try to make myself look like I haven't been deep in thought or concerned. I see a boy around my age walk in. I recognize him from somewhere, his silver hair and calm expression. This is the boy I saw in my dream the other night!  
我听到身后的门打开，转过身试图让自己看起来没有陷入深思或担忧。一个与我年龄相仿的男孩走了进来。我在某个地方见过他，他银色的头发和冷静的表情。这就是我前几晚梦中见到的那个男孩！

I watch as he sets down a tray on a nearby table, there are two cups filled with tea on them. I wish he had asked first, I prefer coffee.  
我看着他把一个托盘放在附近的桌子上，上面有两杯装满茶的杯子。我真希望他先问一声，我更喜欢咖啡。

I wonder what I'm doing here. I'm wondering what is happening to Shinji right now. I can't be here, I have to get out of here and do something.  
我不知道我在这里做什么。我在想真嗣现在发生了什么。我不能待在这里，我必须离开这里，做点什么。

Finally the boy speaks, "You recognize me?"  
终于，男孩开口了，“你认出我了吗？”

I nod my head slowly but I don't say anything.  
我缓缓地点了点头，但什么也没说。

"I am here to help you Asuka. There is much to explain but first I should introduce myself. I am Kaworu Nagisa."  
“我是来帮助你的，明日香。有很多事情需要解释，但首先我应该自我介绍。我是渚薰。”

I know that name but why do I know that name. I think back and then it hits me, Shinji is the one who told me about Kaworu.  
我知道这个名字，但为什么我知道这个名字。我回想了一下，然后想起来了，是真嗣告诉过我关于渚薰的事情。

"You're the final Angel?"  
"你是最后的使徒？"

He nods, "Yes, or at least I was the final Angel. Until this one…"  
他点头，“是的，或者至少我曾经是最后的使徒。直到这一个……”

He gives me the tea and I take it from him but I keep my eyes focused on him. I'm waiting for an explanation. Kaworu Nagisa and Rei appearing at the same time as the Angel makes its presence known. This isn't a coincidence but I'm completely in the dark. I have no idea why I'm here, I should be with Shinji.  
他把茶递给我，我接了过来，但我的目光始终集中在他身上。我在等待一个解释。渚薰和零同时出现，使徒也宣告了它的存在。这不是巧合，但我完全一无所知。我不知道为什么我会在这里，我应该和真嗣在一起。

"What's happening to Shinji?"  
“真嗣怎么了？”

Kaworu sips from his cup, "The Angel that attached itself to Shinji has grown to full strength. The world is has created for him no longer has a use for him but now sees him as a threat and therefore it is trying to eliminate him."  
渚薰啜饮着他的杯子，“附在真嗣身上的天使已经完全成长。这个世界为他创造的环境不再需要他，反而视他为威胁，因此正试图消灭他。”

My heart speeds up at his words, "E-Eliminate him?"  
听到他的话，我的心跳加速，“消、消灭他？”

"Yes. That is why you have been brought here. Right now the Angel is making an attempt to bring the two worlds it has created together. This will allow for a new Impact to occur."  
"是的。这就是为什么你会被带到这儿。现在，天使正试图将它创造的两个世界融合在一起。这将导致一次新的冲击发生。"

I feel my legs grow weak and I stumble slightly. This prompts Kaworu to immediately set down his cup and rush over to me. I feel his hand on my side as he guides me towards the bed and sits me down. His hands are warm as they brush against mine. They're comforting in a way, I wonder if this is what Shinji felt when he was around Kaworu?  
我感觉双腿发软，踉跄了一下。这让渚薰立刻放下杯子，冲到我身边。我感到他的手扶在我的腰侧，引导我走向床边并坐下。他的手温暖地拂过我的手，给人一种安慰的感觉，我不知道这是否就是真嗣在渚薰身边时的感受？

"I apologize, I had little time to rehearse how I was going to deliver the news to you. This might be something of a shock."  
"我很抱歉，我没有太多时间准备如何向你传达这个消息。这可能会让你感到震惊。"

I laugh and feel a smirk spread across my lips, "I'm fine. So Shinji is alright?"  
我笑了起来，嘴角勾起一抹得意的微笑，“我没事。那真嗣还好吗？”

Kaworu nods, "He is… he has suffered some trauma which we are trying to aid him with. Physically he is fine but…"  
渚薰点头道，“他……他经历了一些创伤，我们正尽力帮助他。身体上他没事，但……”

"Mentally he'll need some taking care of… yeah, whatever. Show me to him, you guys will probably only make it worse."  
“心理上他需要一些照顾……是啊，随便吧。带我去见他，你们可能只会让情况更糟。”

I try to stand again but Kaworu immediately grabs me by the shoulders and pushes me back down. My first instinct is to headbutt him for touching me but I decide to play nice.  
我试图再次站起来，但渚薰立刻抓住我的肩膀把我推了回去。我的第一反应是想用头撞他，因为他碰了我，但我决定表现得友好些。

"That isn't a good idea, not until you're both aware of the truth. Seeing you would…"  
“那不是个好主意，至少在你俩都了解真相之前。见到你……”

He pauses for a moment and I can see he's thinking of the best way to word his next sentence. I prepare myself for it but what he says is something I could not prepare for.  
他停顿了一下，我能看出他在斟酌如何表达下一句话。我做好了准备，但他说的却是我想不到的。

"He thinks you're dead. Shinji watched you die yesterday."  
"他以为你死了。真嗣昨天看着你死去。"

---

"Asuka is alright? I want to see her Ayanami! Please."  
"明日香还好吗？我想见她，绫波！求你了。"

"Not yet, she will need time to learn and adjust to the truth."  
"还不行，她需要时间来学习和适应这个真相。"

"What truth? Ayanami, I don't care, just let me see her please."  
"什么真相？绫波，我不在乎，请让我见见她。"

I please with Rei but she doesn't move from her position in front of me. I've tried forcing my way around but Ayanami is a lot stronger than I thought.  
我恳求绫波，但她依然站在我面前不动。我试图强行绕过她，但绫波比我想象的要强得多。

"Please Rei… what is going on here? I… I saw her self-destruct, how can she be alive? Why can't I see her?"  
"拜托了，绫波……这里到底发生了什么？我……我亲眼看到她自爆了，她怎么可能还活着？为什么我不能见她？"

"Because she is not the Asuka you saw blow up yesterday. She is not the Asuka you have been dealing with for the last twenty-five days. She is…"  
"因为她不是你昨天看到的那个爆炸的明日香。她不是你过去二十五天一直在打交道的那个明日香。她是……"

Rei stops for a moment and then I see the small hint of a smile, "She is your Asuka."  
丽停顿了一下，然后我看到了一丝微弱的微笑，"她是你的明日香。"

---

I've died before and Shinji saw that but that was months ago and we both came back. I don't remember dying recently so Kaworu's words are taking a little bit of time to process.  
我以前死过，真嗣见过，但那是几个月前的事了，我们都回来了。我不记得最近有死过，所以渚薰的话需要一点时间来消化。

"What do you mean he watched me die yesterday? Well go in there and tell him I didn't and take me to him!"  
"你什么意思，他说昨天看着我死了？快进去告诉他我没死，带我去见他！"

Kaworu's hands keep me firmly in place and the temptation to knock him over and rush out the door increases but something stops me. Maybe it's the knowledge that my recent impulsive actions have resulted in seriously upsetting Misato and before that me collapsing. So I stay put for the moment.  
渚薰的手紧紧地固定住我，让我忍不住想把他推开冲出门去，但某种东西阻止了我。或许是意识到我最近的冲动行为已经严重惹恼了美里，在此之前还导致了我的昏倒。所以我暂时按兵不动。

"That is what Rei Ayanami is doing right now. You two will see each other but we have to be careful. The Angel is not aware of mine or Ayanami's presence here, now is it aware of your presence. If we brought you to Shinji now it would be a great risk. That's why we have those prepared."  
"这就是绫波零现在正在做的事情。你们会见面的，但我们必须小心。使徒并不知道我和绫波的存在，也不知道你的存在。如果我们现在带你去见真嗣，那将是一个巨大的风险。这就是为什么我们要做好准备。"

He nods towards the window and I look out again at the Evangelion waiting for me. They… Rei and Kaworu did this, how?  
他朝窗户点了点头，我又一次望向窗外等待着我的福音战士。他们……绫波和渚薰是怎么做到的？

"Explain." 解释一下。

"You remember what happened to Shinji?"  
“你还记得真嗣发生了什么吗？”

I nod, "Of course I do! He was shot and fell into a coma."  
我点头，“当然记得！他被枪击中，陷入了昏迷。”

"Yes, and as you're aware that coma was the influence of an Angel that had found its way into Shinji's body."  
"是的，正如你所知，那次昏迷是因一个天使侵入了真嗣的身体而引起的。"

"Yes, I'm aware! I know all about it, now tell me what the hell this is!"  
"我知道！我全都知道了，现在告诉我这到底是什么鬼东西！"

"That Angel wasn't one of us, it was not born from Adam. It was born in a similar way to your Eva's were. A clone of an existing entity. We don't know how but somehow the people who do this were able to choose the twelfth Angel as the subject. When Shinji was infected it created a false reality for him."  
"那个天使并非我们中的一员，它不是从亚当诞生的。它的诞生方式与你们的 EVA 相似。是一个现有实体的克隆体。我们不清楚他们是如何做到的，但那些人选择了第十二使徒作为实验对象。当真嗣被感染时，它为他创造了一个虚假的现实。"

"You mean… he's been living a false life?"  
"你是说…他一直过着虚假的生活？"

"Yes, he awoke in that world believing he had just come out of the Twelfth Angel. He thought all that he had experienced up until then was the influence of the Twelfth Angel. He treated it as a premonition and tried to change things."  
"是的，他在那个世界醒来，以为自己刚刚从第十二使徒的影响中解脱出来。他认为之前经历的一切都是第十二使徒的影响。他把那当作一种预感，试图改变事情。"

I groan, "He… he thought it was all false? The idiot thought all that stuff that had happened to him was not real? Third Impact? The remaining Angels? Our relationship?"  
我呻吟道，"他…他以为这一切都是假的吗？那个白痴以为发生在他身上的那些事都不是真的？第三次冲击？剩下的使徒？我们的关系？"

"Yes… well, in a fashion. He sensed something was wrong but the Angel had a powerful influence over him. It was able to create a perfect facsimile of your world and everyone in it for him. He thought he had been given a chance to redo everything, to make a better world for you."  
“是的……这么说吧。他感觉到有些不对劲，但天使对他有着强大的影响力。它能够为他创造一个你所在世界的完美复制品，以及其中的每一个人。他以为自己得到了一个重做一切的机会，为你创造一个更好的世界。”

"Idiot, you can't redo things, we said that from the beginning!"  
“傻瓜，你不能重来，我们从一开始就说过！”

I look up at him and suddenly realize the implications of this. Shinji was in a world with another version of me. That would have been one of the things he tried to change wasn't it? The relationship between me and him!  
我抬头看着他，突然意识到这其中的含义。真嗣身处一个有另一个我的世界。那不正是他想改变的事情之一吗？我和他之间的关系！

"Wait… he… and me… the other me? You said I died?"  
"等等……他……和我……另一个我？你说我死了？"

"Yes. Shinji started by saving his friend and then he started perusing a relationship with your counterpart here. This made you both stronger, you were both able to defeat the other Angels with ease and by the time of the sixteenths arrival there were four Evangelion Units deployed. Shinji, You, Rei Ayanami and myself."  
"是的。真嗣先是从救他的朋友开始，然后他开始追求与这里的你的对应体的关系。这让你俩都变得更强大，你们都能轻松击败其他使徒，到了第十六使徒出现时，已经有四台 EVA 机体投入战斗。真嗣、你、绫波零和我。"

I remember that fight. I was unable to do anything in it, my Eva wouldn't move. That was the last straw for me, the final step on my descent into darkness. Kaworu means to tell me that Shinji had managed to change that so I could fight in this world.  
我记得那场战斗。我什么也做不了，我的 EVA 动不了。那是我陷入黑暗的最后一根稻草，是我堕落的最后一步。渚薰想告诉我，真嗣设法改变了这一切，让我能在这个世界战斗。

"In that battle in the real world it was Rei who took on the Angel and unfortunately perished. In this world it was you. You were attacked and the Angel invaded your body, you activate-"  
"在那场现实世界的战斗中，是丽面对了使徒并不幸牺牲。在这个世界，是你。你遭到了攻击，使徒侵入了你的身体，你启动了——"

"Stop! I don't need to hear anymore. I get it, I died. Again, big fucking deal. I'm going to kill that idiot, he…"  
"停！我不想再听了。我明白了，我又死了。又怎样，天大的事似的。我要杀了那个白痴，他……"

A million scenarios run through my head featuring Shinji and this false Asuka. My stomach churns at the thought of it all. I feel like throwing Kaworu off of me, telling him to leave so that I can smash up this room in anger. I feel betrayed by the idiot. How could he have not realized?  
无数关于真嗣和这个假明日香的场景在我脑海中闪过。一想到这些，我就感到胃里一阵翻腾。我真想把渚推开，让他离开，这样我就可以愤怒地砸烂这个房间。我感到被那个白痴背叛了。他怎么可能没意识到？

Kaworu's hands lift from my shoulders, he kneels down and grabs my hands.  
渚薰的手从我的肩膀上抬起，他跪下来握住了我的手。

"Shinji was doing what he thought was right. Unfortunately there was no way for him to realize what was real or false. The Angel created a perfect version of your world and allowed for Shinji to use his 'future knowledge' to alter things. It was catering the world to aid him change things and from that it would draw its power."  
“真嗣在做他认为正确的事。不幸的是，他无法意识到什么是真实的，什么是虚假的。天使创造了一个完美的你的世界版本，并允许真嗣利用他的‘未来知识’来改变事物。它是在迎合世界，帮助他改变事物，并从中汲取力量。”

I listen to the words but few are reaching me. I'm caught thinking about how Shinji and this other Asuka would have spoken to each other. How she would have fallen asleep in his arms, how they'll have kissed and done things that we would have done. While I was sat there looking on trying to help him he was…  
我听着这些话，但很少能传达到我心里。我陷入了思考，想象着真嗣和另一个明日香会如何交谈。她会如何在他怀里入睡，他们会如何亲吻并做着我们可能会做的事。当我坐在那里试图帮助他时，他却在……

"I-I'll still…" "我-我还是会…"

Kaworu tightens his grip on my hands, he gives me a look that freezes me in place and I realize the truth. The Angel, those people who made it. It used him. It used Shinji and now it's about to discard him now that it's done. It gave him a false happiness and made him believe it. I probably would have done the same. Yet I feel like I should have been able to do more. All I could do was sit by his bedside while he went through all of this. My words and music… none of it got through to him. It was all useless.  
渚薰紧紧握住我的手，他投来的目光让我僵在原地，我意识到了真相。那个使徒，制造它的人们。它利用了他。它利用了真嗣，现在它完成了使命，即将抛弃他。它给了他虚假的幸福，让他信以为真。我大概也会做出同样的选择。然而，我感到自己本应能做得更多。我所能做的只是坐在他的床边，看着他经历这一切。我的话语和音乐…都没能传达到他心里。一切都毫无用处。

My stomach drops severely as her words drift around in my mind.  
她的言语在我脑海中回荡，我的心情沉重至极。

"A-A false reality?" “——虚假的现实？”

Everything I've experienced for the past twenty five days wasn't real? From the moment I woke up in that hospital room to watching Asuka die. It was all a false reality created by an Angel that had infected my body. I wasn't changing anything. I was just living out a fantasy while everyone else suffered in the real world.  
过去二十五天我所经历的一切都不是真实的？从我在那间病房醒来，到目睹明日香死去。这一切都是感染了我身体的天使所创造的虚假现实。我并没有改变任何事。我只是在幻想中生活，而其他人则在现实世界中受苦。

I suddenly go very dizzy as everything tries to iron itself out in my mind. I feel myself getting short of breath and grip the duvet very tightly. I slow my breaths down trying to regain some composure before looking up at Rei.  
我突然感到极度眩晕，脑海中的一切都在试图理清。我感到呼吸急促，紧紧抓住被子。我放缓呼吸，试图恢复一些镇定，然后抬头看向绫波。

"Rei… I-I…" "丽…我-我…"

I bring my hands up to my face and start sobbing as the emotions finally burst through that wall they were threatening to earlier. I should have known from the start. I should have known that it was impossible to change things. I should have realized that what I was experiencing wasn't real but I didn't. I let it fool me! I let myself believe I could change things. I was so blinded by my desire to change things I just accepted that I had been trapped in the Twelfth and was now free.  
我双手掩面，开始啜泣，情感终于冲破了之前一直威胁要崩溃的那堵墙。我早该知道。我早该明白改变是不可能的。我早该意识到我所经历的并非真实，但我没有。我被它愚弄了！我让自己相信我能改变一切。我被改变一切的渴望蒙蔽了双眼，我竟然接受了被困在第十二区而现在自由了的假象。

I feel Rei put her arm around my shoulder and embrace me as I sit their crying. It takes a few minutes but eventually the tears start to subside. She hands me a tissue to wipe my eyes with.  
我感觉丽把手臂搭在我的肩上，拥抱着哭泣的我。过了几分钟，泪水终于渐渐止住。她递给我一张纸巾擦干眼泪。

"Ikari… " "碇君… "

"Rei I… I can't face her now…"  
"丽一号…我现在无法面对她…"

"Why not?" "为什么不行？"

I'm about to yell out because I fucked the one in this world. I betrayed her in the worst way. While she was suffering I was dating a fake Asuka. I was going to restaurants, I was going to concerts and I was having sex with her. Asuka was suffering in the real world and all I never knew!  
我几乎要大喊出来，因为我在这个世界背叛了她。我以最糟糕的方式背叛了她。当她在这个世界受苦时，我却和另一个假明日香约会。我去餐厅，去音乐会，还和她发生了关系。真正的明日香在现实世界中受苦，而我却一无所知！

"I… I betrayed her! I…"  
"我…我背叛了她！我…"

"That is untrue, although this world you were in has become real the Angel made every effort at first to cater it to your needs. The people within it were perfect copies of the ones you knew from that moment in time."  
"那并非事实，尽管你所处的这个世界已经变得真实，但天使最初竭尽全力使其迎合你的需求。其中的人们都是你当时所认识的人的完美复制品。"

"But I… I should have known."  
"但我…我本应察觉到的。"

"How? There was no possible way for you to know, unless you had been told and even then until this moment would you have believed it?"  
"怎么可能？你不可能知道这件事，除非有人告诉你，即便如此，直到这一刻你也不会相信吧？"

I stop to think about it but the reality of it is confusing me. Was this world real or just some kind of dream world conjured up by the Angel? Her question rings in my ears, would I have believed it if I had been told?  
我停下来思考，但现实让我感到困惑。这个世界是真实的，还是天使所创造的某种梦境？她的疑问在我耳边回响，如果有人告诉我，我会相信吗？

"If you or Kaworu had…"  
"如果你或渚薰曾经……"

"We were unable to. Not until this moment. If we had the Angel would have done everything to eliminate us, we would have been unable to help in this moment."  
"我们无法做到。直到这一刻。如果我们早有行动，天使必定会尽一切可能消灭我们，我们也就无法在这关键时刻提供帮助。"

I sit back and think of Asuka again trying to calm myself down. The tears have thankfully stopped but I still don't feel right. I feel guilt and sadness for her. For all she went through.  
我坐回去，再次想起明日香，试图让自己平静下来。幸运的是，泪水已经停止，但我仍然感觉不对劲。我为她感到内疚和悲伤。为她所经历的一切。

"I just… She… would have been worried about me, she… what do I do now?"  
"我只是……她……会担心我，她……我现在该怎么办？"

"The Angel is attempting to converge the worlds, you fight it. Alongside Sohryu."  
"天使正试图融合世界，你得与之对抗。与长龙一起。"

I turn my head and look out the window to where Unit 01 is waiting for me. I turn back to Rei and see her looking straight into my eyes.  
我转过头，望向窗外，那里零号机正等待着我。我回过头看向丽，她正直视着我的眼睛。

"T-The Eva?" "零-零号机？"

Rei nods, "Only Eva can defeat the Angel's. Even if this Angel is man-made."  
丽点头，“只有 Eva 能击败使徒。即便这个使徒是人造的。”

"But… you said this is a false reality!"  
“但是……你说过这是虚假的现实！”

"No, this world is and has been real. The Angel is attempting convergence of the two worlds, it is merging the two realities together."  
“不，这个世界一直就是真实的。使徒正试图融合两个世界，它正在将两种现实合二为一。”

"So… the Eva's are…" "所以…EVA 们是…"

"Yes." "是的。"

---

Even with Kaworu's explanation this still doesn't make any sense. The Angel plans to merge its reality with ours. From that it can create a new Impact. I don't understand how, Adam and Lilith are gone.  
即使有渚薰的解释，这仍然毫无意义。天使计划将其现实与我们的融合。由此它可以创造一个新的冲击。我不明白这是怎么做到的，亚当和莉莉丝都已经消失了。

Then I realize what it means if the Angel merges its reality with this one. In this world Lilith still exists. It's there below that world's version of NERV.  
然后我意识到如果天使将其现实与这个世界融合意味着什么。在这个世界里，莉莉丝仍然存在。它就在那个世界的 NERV 分部下面。

"You have realized then, Lilith is sleeping below NERV. The Angel has already began its process or eliminating that which it doesn't need from this world. Only Tokyo-3 and Shinji remain. We've managed to extract Shinji but the Angel will be pushing ahead."  
“那么你已经意识到了，莉莉丝正在 NERV 下方沉睡。使徒已经开始执行其消除这个世界不必要之物的程序。只剩下东京-3 和真嗣。我们已经设法救出了真嗣，但使徒将继续推进。”

I nod somewhat stunned into silence by all of this. A Fourth Impact, caused by an Angel that was created by man and being controlled by them. None of it seems possible but I know it is. We have to fight it. I'm still confused by one more thing. Unit 02 was destroyed in the real world and according to Kaworu the other Asuka destroyed hers. So why is it here now?  
我点了点头，被这一切震惊得有些沉默。由人类创造并受其控制的使徒引发的第四次冲击。这一切似乎都不可能，但我知道这是真的。我们必须与之战斗。我还有一个疑问。在现实世界中，零号机被摧毁了，而根据渚薰的说法，另一个明日香也毁掉了她的机体。那么为什么它现在会在这里？

I look out towards Unit 02, my Unit 02 and Kaworu speaks.  
我望向零号机，我的零号机，渚薰开口说道。

"You're wondering how it is possible for Unit 02 to be here considering both versions were destroyed."  
"你在想，考虑到两个版本都已被摧毁，零二号机怎么可能在这里。"

I nod, "Yes." 我点头，“是的。”

"This space in which we inhabit is an extension of our hopes and wishes for the future of the world."  
"我们所处的这个空间，是我们对世界未来希望与愿望的延伸。"

"So you're saying your hope created put Unit 02 here?"  
"所以你是说，你的希望创造了零二号机在这里？"

"Exactly." "确实。"

"That sounds…" "听起来……"

He almost looks hurt when I start to explain how ridiculous that sounds, so I hold back for a moment.  
当我开始解释这听起来有多荒谬时，他几乎显得受伤了，所以我一时忍住了。

"I'm aware of how it sounds but do not forget it was Shinjis hope, desire and love for others that ultimately saved the world during Third Impact. Myself and Rei are not human nor are we Angel anymore, therefore our hope and desire might be able to conjure up something a little bit more special."  
"我知道这听起来如何，但别忘了正是真嗣对他人希望、渴望和爱的力量，在第三次冲击中拯救了世界。我和丽既非人类，也不再是使徒，因此我们的希望和渴望或许能召唤出一些更特别的东西。"

"That… makes sense. I guess…"  
"那…说得通。我想…"

Kaworu kneels down in front of me and takes both of my hands. Again I'm filled with the same warmth I was earlier. I can't explain it but Kaworu makes me feel different somehow, his presence is calming and reassuring despite all the fears running around inside my head. I look across at him.  
渚薰在我面前跪下，握住我的双手。我又一次感受到了之前的那种温暖。我无法解释，但渚薰让我感觉有些不同，他的存在平静而令人安心，尽管我脑海中充满了恐惧。我转头看向他。

"You know… Shinji told me about you…"  
"你知道…真嗣跟我提起过你…"

His eyes avert their gaze from mine. I can see a hint of redness fill his cheeks and he replies softly.  
他的目光从我身上移开。我看到他的脸颊泛起一丝红晕，他轻声回答。

"Yes, I imagine he would have done."  
“是的，我想他会的。”

"You… befriended him when no one else was around didn't you?"  
“你……在无人陪伴时与他结交了，对吗？”

He nods but his eyes don't meet mine. Probably because he knows what I'm about to say to him. Throughout all of this I've had that in the back of my mind. Kaworu is or was an Angel. The words leave my lips. I take no joy in speaking them but I have to know for certain that this isn't a trick.  
他点头了，但目光并未与我相接。或许因为他知道我即将对他说什么。这一切过程中，我始终在脑海后部保留着这个念头。渚薰是或曾是使徒。这些话从我口中说出。我并非乐意说出口，但我必须确信这不是一个诡计。

"And you… betrayed him." “而你……背叛了他。”

"I… I did and…" “我……我确实背叛了……”

He pauses and looks at me. I watch as his features change to a look of regret. I don't know a lot about Kaworu, I don't know the sort of person he was. I know what Shinji told me about this enigmatic person who filled a space in his life in that moment of time. I was a little bit jealous to hear about Kaworu to be honest. Kaworu provided support for Shinji in a way that I couldn't nor do I think I'm able. I'm just not the person to say things the way Kaworu did.  
他顿了顿，目光转向我。我看着他的表情转变为一种悔恨。我对渚薰了解不多，不知道他是个怎样的人。我只知道真嗣告诉我的关于这个神秘人物的事，他在那个特定时刻填补了真嗣生活中的空白。说实话，听到关于渚薰的事，我有点嫉妒。渚薰以一种我无法做到的方式支持着真嗣，我想我也做不到。我终究不是能像渚薰那样说话的人。

"I cannot make up for that."  
“我无法弥补那一点。”

"Why did you do it? Why befriend him only to betray him? You were an Angel and an Eva pilot, why not just go straight for Lilith?"  
“你为什么要这么做？为什么要接近他，然后背叛他？你既是天使又是 EVA 驾驶员，为什么不直接去找莉莉丝？”

"I had heard so much about him, I had heard so much about yourself I wanted to meet you both. Obviously I couldn't meet you but I met Shinji and… well he had an effect on me…"  
"我听说了许多关于他的事，也听说了许多关于你自己的事，我渴望与你们两人见面。显然，我无法见到你，但我遇到了真嗣，而且……他对我的影响颇深……"

"Yeah he has a habit of doing that…"  
"是啊，他有这样的习惯……"

"I started to question why I was here and what my purpose was. I was raised for one specific task, to bring about the Third Impact. I was told that this was humanities only option by the man who raised me."  
"我开始质疑自己为何在此，我的目的是什么。我被培养来完成一个特定的任务，引发第三次冲击。抚养我的那个人告诉我，这是人类唯一的出路。"

"So what changed?" “那是什么改变了？”

"I was ready to do it. I took Unit 02 and I descended into Terminal Dogma with it. Shinji fought against me, he fought against Unit 02. He even apologized to you while he was doing it fearing you were inside."  
“我曾准备好去做。我驾驶了二号机，深入到最终教条区。真嗣与我对抗，他与二号机战斗。甚至在战斗中，他还向你道歉，担心你在里面。”

I didn't know about that. The idiot knew I was in the hospital, how would I have been piloting Unit 02 in that state?  
“我对此一无所知。那傻瓜知道我在医院，那种状态下我怎么可能驾驶二号机？”

"So… when we arrived there I saw that it wasn't Adam in front of me like I had been led to believe. It was Lilith."  
"于是…当我们到达那里时，我发现站在我面前的并不是他们让我以为的亚当。那是莉莉丝。"

"You were lied to?" "你被骗了？"

"Yes. I realized that Adam was no more. His soul was within me but I had been reborn as Tabris. If I were to merge with Lilith I would condemn mankind to non-existence rather than the rebirth they promised and I would remain on this Earth as a solitary figure. I would be immortal but incredibly lonely. That was what they wanted me to realize, so I gave my life to Shinji. In the hope that humanity would live on. I did not realize they would use the Eva series to start Third Impact."  
"是的。我意识到亚当已不复存在。他的灵魂在我体内，但我已重生为塔布里斯。如果我与莉莉丝融合，我将使人类走向灭亡而非他们所承诺的重生，而我将作为孤独的存在留在这地球上。我将永生，但极度孤独。这就是他们希望我领悟的，所以我将生命献给了真嗣。怀着人类能继续生存的希望。我未曾料到他们会利用 EVA 系列引发第三次冲击。"

"I don't understand, why did you have to die?"  
"我不明白，你为什么要死？"

"If I didn't die then they would have killed me anyway. My body was riddled with failsafes implanted by them. I had no choice but to die but at least I could make the choice of how to die…"  
"如果我不死，他们无论如何也会杀了我。我的身体里被植入了他们的多重保险措施。我别无选择，只能死，但至少我能选择如何死去……"

I can't believe the words coming out of Kaworu's mouth. His death, his choice fucked Shinji up completely. It put Shinji on the path to nearly destroying the world and yet I can't fault Kaworu. If I was in that place would I have done the same? It was perhaps his act of defiance against the people who betrayed him.  
我无法相信这些话出自渚薰之口。他的死亡，他的选择彻底击垮了真嗣。这使真嗣走上了几乎毁灭世界的道路，然而我却无法责怪渚薰。如果我处在那个位置，我会不会也做出同样的选择？这或许是他对抗那些背叛他的人的一种反抗行为。

I look down at Kaworu and I see the sadness on his face now. He as a victim of this whole mess too just like we all were. Just at that moment there is a huge rumble, the ground shakes violently and I watch as the two cups of tea on the side fall to the floor smashing into little pieces. Kaworu looks upwards.  
我低头看着渚薰，此刻他的脸上满是悲伤。他也是这场混乱的受害者，就像我们所有人一样。就在那一刻，一阵巨大的轰鸣声响起，地面剧烈摇晃，我眼看着旁边的两杯茶倒在地上，摔成了碎片。渚薰抬头望去。

"It begins…" “开始了……”

I look towards Unit 02 again and suddenly I'm hit with a number of thoughts. I have to pilot it don't I? I actually have to put on a plugsuit again and climb into an Entry Plug. I have to go up that elevator shaft and I don't know what I have to face.  
我再次望向二号机，突然间脑海中涌入了许多念头。我必须驾驶它，不是吗？我得再次穿上插入栓服，爬进驾驶舱。我得乘电梯上升，而我不知将要面对什么。

I look down at my hands and their shaking, I'm actually scared and I'm showing it. After what happened last time how can I not be? I can't even hide this. I'm not Asuka Langley Sohryu the Evangelion pilot anymore, that ended months ago. I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu the girl, the survivor and Shinji's protector.  
我低头看着自己颤抖的双手，我真的害怕了，而且表现了出来。经历了上次的事情，我怎能不害怕？我甚至无法掩饰这一点。我不再是那个《福音战士》驾驶员惣流·明日香·兰格雷了，那已经是几个月前的事了。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，一个女孩，一个幸存者，也是真嗣的保护者。

I take a deep breath and look ahead at Unit 02s face. I'll do it, I'll fight and protect Shinji. Only this time I won't lose. I can't lose.  
我深吸一口气，望向前方二号机的面孔。我会做到的，我会战斗并保护真嗣。只是这一次，我不能输。我输不起。

---

I have to pilot it again. I have to get inside an Evangelion and use it to fight our enemy. I feel like I'm about to throw up at the thought of it. After what happened last time I fought in one, watching Asuka die like that. How can I actually pilot again? Even if that wasn't the real Asuka, she felt real to me and I can't risk that again.  
我必须再次驾驶它。我必须进入福音战士内部，用它来对抗我们的敌人。一想到这个，我就感觉快要吐了。上次战斗后，眼看着明日香那样死去。我怎么还能再次驾驶呢？即使那不是真正的明日香，她对我来说感觉如此真实，我不能再冒这个险了。

"She will be there with you Ikari."  
"她会和你在一起的，碇。"

I look up at Rei, "I know but… she, we… how can we do this Rei? I can't protect her, I tried to and I failed. Even if that wasn't real I still failed. I don't know how to protect her. I don't know how to protect anyone."  
我抬头看向绫波，"我知道，但是…她，我们…我们怎么能做到呢？我无法保护她，我尝试过，但我失败了。即使那不是真的，我依然失败了。我不知道如何保护她。我不知道如何保护任何人。"

Her hand reaches for my face and for a moment I'm reminded of my mother. Rei is looking down at me her eyes stern and serious.  
她的手伸向我的脸，那一刻我想起了我的母亲。绫波低头看着我，眼神严肃而认真。

"You won't fail." "你不会失败的。"

"How can you say that? You don't know that."  
"你怎么能这么说？你并不知道。"

"Because I have faith in you and Sohryu."  
"因为我相信你和苏里尤。"

I remember when I first met Rei she once asked me if I had faith in my father's work. I told her I didn't and asked how I ever could when he wasn't even a father to me. She slapped me. My father's work was the Evangelion and despite his own scenario deviating from their supposed purpose the Eva's did work and they did save us. She was right to have faith in his work, despite my feelings towards him.  
我记得第一次遇见丽时，她曾问我是否相信我父亲的工作。我告诉她我不信，并反问她，他连个父亲都不曾是我，我怎么可能相信。她扇了我一巴掌。我父亲的工作是制造 EVA，尽管他自己的计划偏离了它们本应的目的，但 EVA 确实有效，它们确实救了我们。她有理由相信他的工作，尽管我对他的感情复杂。

Now she has faith in me and Asuka. She has faith we can stop the Angel and save the world. I wish I had that faith too.  
现在她相信我和明日香。她相信我们能阻止使徒，拯救世界。我也希望能拥有那样的信念。

I look out towards Unit 01 again. Ayanami, Kaworu, Misato, Fuyutsuki and Asuka. All their faces flash in front of me. The people I've met since returning who are in the shelter and the people around the world who are unaware of what is happening right now. Their lives are in my hands. I have to pilot it again. I have to fight our enemy. I have to win.  
我再次望向零号机。绫波、薰、美里、冬月和明日香。他们的面孔在我眼前闪过。自从回来后在避难所遇到的那些人，以及世界各地那些此刻还不知情的人们。他们的生命掌握在我手中。我必须再次驾驶它。我必须与我们的敌人战斗。我必须取胜。

Just as I'm about to get up we hear a voice in the room, "Ayanami, Evangelion Unit 02 has launched and is heading towards the surface. The Angel is starting its attack."  
就在我准备起身时，房间里传来一个声音：“绫波，EVA 二号机已经启动，正向地面进发。使徒开始攻击了。”

**Outskirts of Tokyo-3 东京-3 郊外**

The car pulls up on a cliff overlooking the former city and I quickly get out the car. I'm followed by Fuyutsuki and Rebecca. The reports came in a short while ago, strange sightings where Tokyo-3 used to be. I'm stunned at I look out across where the city used to be. Looking down I can see the Geofront as it was. NERV headquarters are there.  
车子停在一个俯瞰旧城市的悬崖边，我迅速下车。副司令和丽贝卡紧随其后。不久前有报告称，在东京-3 旧址出现了奇怪的现象。我震惊地望着曾经的城市所在之处。低头一看，还能看到地下的 Geofront，NERV 总部就在那里。

Swirls of dust are being created around the enter area and the noise is almost deafening. I glance upwards and floating above the Geofront is a giant sphere resembling the Twelfth Angel only this is at least three times the size. I hear a distant rumbling and look down at the Geofront just in time to see one of the elevators shoot up out of the ground.  
尘土在入口区域周围旋转，噪音几乎震耳欲聋。我抬头望去，只见在 Geofront 上方悬浮着一个巨大的球体，酷似第十二使徒，但这个至少是它的三倍大。我听到远处传来隆隆声，低头看向 Geofront，正好看到一个电梯从地面射出。

Rebecca yells over the noise, "What the hell is happening? I thought all of this was destroyed?"  
Rebecca 在噪音中大喊：“这到底是怎么回事？我以为这一切都被摧毁了？”

"It was! I… oh my god…"  
“确实被摧毁了！我……哦，天哪……”

I look forward and see Unit 02 appear from where the elevator had shot out of the ground. Shortly afterwards this is followed by Unit 01 also making its appearance. I look up towards the Angel again. It's not moving but I see sections of it start to pulsate.  
我向前望去，看到 02 号机从电梯冲出地面的地方现身。不久之后，01 号机也相继出现。我再次抬头看向使徒。它没有移动，但我看到它的部分开始脉动。

They remain like this for a short time with the pulses becoming more violent until eventually the flesh of the Angel tears open. From each hole emerges a white winged figure, each carrying a large lance. With horror I realize that I've seen them before.  
它们就这样持续了一段时间，脉动愈发剧烈，直到最终使徒的肉体撕裂开来。从每个裂口中冒出一个白色羽翼的身影，每个都手持巨大的长枪。我惊恐地意识到，我以前见过它们。

### Chapter 23 Still The Children
I feel myself get pushed back into my seat as the Eva shoots through the elevator shaft to its destination. The familiar surge of adrenaline before battle kicks in and I'm aware of a confident smile forming on my face. Eventually the Eva comes to a stop and I survey the environment. It's the Geofront, intact just as it was before Third Impact. Kaworu was right, the Angel is attempting to merge the two worlds together. It's bringing its own reality across into ours. At 13.75 kilometres across at its largest point it might not seem like a lot. It might even seem insignificant compared to the rest of Japan, even the world but within this spherical object will now lie a fresh version of the being known as Lilith.  
当 Eva 穿过电梯井到达目的地时，我感觉自己被推回到座位上。战斗前熟悉的肾上腺素激增开始出现，我意识到我的脸上露出了自信的微笑。最终伊娃停了下来，我环顾四周。这是地缘阵线，完好无损，就像第三次冲击之前一样。薰是对的，天使正试图将两个世界融合在一起。它将自己的现实带入我们的现实。最大点的直径为 13.75 公里，看起来可能并不多。与日本其他地方甚至世界相比，它甚至可能显得微不足道，但在这个球形物体中，现在将躺着一个被称为莉莉丝的新版本。

With this being the ones controlling this Angel can condemn humanity to its end. Of course they see things differently, their goal is to bring humanity to one being in an aim to eliminate the holes within our hearts. To bring us to a world of no sadness, no pain, no misery and no hurt. It sounded tempting once over, Shinji almost allowed it to happen but then he realized a world without all of those things means a world of no happiness either, a world catered to your needs means you can't know true happiness. It will just lead to emptiness eventually. It's running away. Something I've grown accustomed to over the last ten or so years.  
有了这些人，控制这个天使就可以谴责人类的末日。当然，他们看待事物的方式不同，他们的目标是将人性带入一个存在体，以消除我们内心的漏洞。带我们进入一个没有悲伤、没有痛苦、没有苦难、没有伤害的世界。这听起来很诱人，真嗣几乎允许它发生，但后来他意识到一个没有所有这些东西的世界也意味着一个没有幸福的世界，一个满足你需求的世界意味着你无法知道真正的幸福。最终只会导致空虚。它正在逃跑。在过去十年左右的时间里我已经习惯了。

Running away from my true feelings to appear strong so that I wouldn't be hurt. Hiding behind a façade and pushing people away so that they can't hurt me. All it led to was being hurt and I paid the price for it. I won't pay that price anymore, I have to win this time.  
逃避我的真实感受，表现得坚强，这样我就不会受到伤害。躲在门面后面并把人们推开，这样他们就无法伤害我。这一切导致的只是受伤，我为此付出了代价。我不会再付出那样的代价了，这一次我一定要赢。

"I understand now Mama, the meaning of the A.T. Field. You were always watching over me weren't you? You were always protecting me, you were always here. You're here now aren't you?"  
“我现在明白了妈妈，A.T.场的意义。你一直在看着我，不是吗？你一直在保护我，你一直都在这里。你现在在这里，不是吗？”

I get no reply but I feel something from inside the Evangelion. It's a warmth I've felt before when I first realized she was in here. She can't communicate with me properly without taking me inside the Eva and I know she won't do that. Instead I look down at the panel and I see my sync ratio. It's eighty five point seven two. A new personal best. That's how she communicates with me.  
我没有得到任何答复，但我从新世纪福音战士内部感觉到了一些东西。当我第一次意识到她在这里时，我感受到了一种温暖。如果不带我进入伊娃，她就无法与我正常交流，我知道她不会这样做。相反，我低头看着面板，看到了我的同步率。现在是八十五点七二分。新的个人最好成绩。这就是她与我沟通的方式。

"Hey Mama, this'll probably be the last time we speak but… I wanted you to know I'm not lonely anymore. I found someone or at least we found each other. He's the pilot of Unit 01, Shinji Ikari. You probably knew his mother didn't you? Well anyway he's a bit of an idiot and he's really shy but… he's like me. He lost his mother when he was younger and his father didn't want much to do with him. We just dealt with it in different ways and well I'm going to protect him. We're going to protect him. We're going to save the world now mama."  
“嘿，妈妈，这可能是我们最后一次说话，但是……我想让你知道，我不再孤独了。我找到了一个人，或者至少我们找到了彼此。他是 01 号机组的飞行员，碇真司。你可能认识他的母亲，不是吗？好吧，他有点白痴，而且他真的很害羞，但是……他就像我一样，在他年轻的时候就失去了他的母亲，他的父亲不想和他有太多关系。用不同的方式处理这件事，我会保护他，我们会保护他，妈妈。”

I look down, another two points is added to my sync ratio. I grin and nod my head.  
我低头一看，我的同步率又增加了两点。我微笑着点点头。

"Thank you mama, let's do this."  
“谢谢妈妈，我们就这样吧。”

I'm pushed back into my seat as me and the Eva rocket through the shaft to the Geofront. I'm nervous because I know she is going to be waiting for me when I get up there. Asuka, the real Asuka… my Asuka.  
当我和 Eva 火箭穿过竖井到达 Geofront 时，我被推回到座位上。我很紧张，因为我知道当我到达那里时她会等我。飞鸟，真正的飞鸟……我的飞鸟。

I've not had a lot of time to think about all that's happened. In the past few hours my emotions have been hammered from all sides. The grief I felt when I thought I had lost her. The joy when I realized she was still alive. The confusion when I learned that I had been trapped in another reality. The guilt I felt when I learned the Asuka I had been with for the past twenty five days was not real. The sorrow I felt for what she had to go through in the real world. The panic I'm not feeling as I head towards yet another fight.  
我没有太多时间去思考所发生的一切。在过去的几个小时里，我的情绪受到了来自四面八方的打击。当我以为我失去了她时，我感到悲伤。当我意识到她还活着时我很高兴。当我得知自己被困在另一个现实中时，我感到很困惑。当我得知过去二十五天和我在一起的明日香并不真实时，我感到内疚。我为她在现实世界中必须经历的事情感到悲伤。当我走向另一场战斗时，我不再感到恐慌。

Eventually I arrive at the Geofront, the Evangelion comes to a sudden stop and I survey the land in front of me. It's all here and intact but as I look out I can see the familiar remnants of the real world. In the distance the sea of LCL can be spotted along with Liliths head. It's nearly completely submerged now.  
最终我到达了地质前线，新世纪福音战士突然停下来，我审视着面前的土地。一切都在这里并且完好无损，但当我向外看时，我可以看到现实世界中熟悉的遗迹。远处可以看到拼箱的海洋和莉莉丝的头。现在几乎完全被淹没了。

_"Good of you to join me Shinji."  
“很高兴你能加入我，真嗣。”_

I hear the voice coming over the radio and my heart fills with joy at the sound of her voice. I go to reply and immediately feel the guilt wash over me. There is so much I want to say at once, I want to apologize to her and explain everything but all I can do is stutter out her name.  
我听到收音机里传来她的声音，我的心因她的声音而充满喜悦。我去回复，立即感到内疚。我想说的太多了，我想向她道歉，解释一切，但我能做的就是结结巴巴地说出她的名字。

"A-A-Asuka!" “啊、啊、飞鸟！”

_"It's been a while…" “有一阵子了…”_

Her voice. She doesn't sound angry or upset but there is an edge to it. I wonder if she knows everything. Would Kaworu have told her? He probably would have done, he will have had to have done.  
她的声音。她听起来并不生气或不安，但也有其优势。我想知道她是否知道一切。薰会告诉她吗？他可能会这么做，他也不得不这么做。

"Yeah! Look… Asuka… I have a lot to explain and… I just…"  
“是啊！听着……明日香……我有很多事情要解释，而且……我只是……”

She swiftly cuts me off. Again I can't tell how she is from here. She sounds surprisingly calm but there is something behind it. I know her. She's holding something back.  
她很快打断了我的话。我再次无法从这里看出她的情况。她听起来出奇的平静，但背后却隐藏着某种东西。我认识她。她在隐瞒什么。

_"Cool it. I know everything, explain later…"  
“冷静点，我都知道了，稍后解释……”_

"You know everything?" “你什么都知道吗？”

_"Everything." “一切。”_

"Even abo-" “甚至阿博——”

_"Especially that." “尤其是那个。”_

"Oh… I…" “哦……我……”

_"Yeah yeah! You're sorry. I get it. Kaworu explained it all to me…"  
「是啊是啊！对不起。我明白了。薰都向我解释过了……」_

"You're not mad?" “你没生气吧？”

_"Oh I'm mad. In fact I'm very mad Shinji, mad that someone dared to try to take you away from me. Mad that they used a false me to keep you there. Mad that they tried to use you to end the world. I'm very angry, which is why I'm going to show these people what happens when I get angry."  
“哦，我很生气。事实上，我很生气真嗣，很生气有人敢试图把你从我身边夺走。很生气他们用一个虚假的我把你留在那里。很生气他们试图利用你来结束我非常生气，这就是为什么我要向这些人展示当我生气时会发生什么。”_

"But!" “但！”

_"It can wait Shinji, for now we fight."  
“可以等一下真嗣，现在我们就战斗吧。”_

I turn around and I can see Unit 02 facing me. It's stood up to full height and I can sense her inside it smiling. She's right, discussions can wait. We have to fight one last time and we have to win. I look up and I see the Angel. A giant black and white patterned sphere. It's exactly like the Twelfth only three times as large. It's hovering in the air between the two of us. From here neither of us would be able to reach it.  
我转过身，看到 02 号部队正对着我。它完全竖立起来，我能感觉到她在里面微笑。她是对的，讨论可以等待。我们必须最后一战，我们必须获胜。我抬起头，看到了天使。一个巨大的黑白图案球体。它和第十二号一模一样，只是大三倍。它悬浮在我们两人之间的空中。从这里我们谁也无法到达那里。

Suddenly I see sections of its surface start to pulsate. The pulses increase in speed and ferocity until eventually the flesh of the Angel tears open. From each of the tears emerges a single white Evangelion Unit. Each of them carrying a huge double sided sword and each extending its wings to full width. They start to circle the Angel before looking down at us.  
突然我看到它表面的某些部分开始脉动。脉冲的速度和猛烈程度不断增加，直到天使的肉体最终撕裂。从每一滴眼泪中都会出现一个白色的新世纪福音战士单位。他们每个人都拿着一把巨大的双面剑，并且每个人都张开双翼。他们开始绕着天使转一圈，然后俯视我们。

---

I watch as the nine members of the Eva series emerge from the Angel. I admit it, I'm a little bit scared at the sight of them. Only I know this time things will be different. I don't have to rely on back-up power. I'm plugged in. I know to take out the cores properly this time. I also have Shinji besides me. The invincible Shinji, as long as he is here there's no way I can lose.  
我看着伊娃系列的九名成员从天使中出现。我承认，看到他们我有点害怕。只有我知道，这一次事情会有所不同。我不必依赖备用电源。我已接通电源。这次我知道要正确取出核心。除了我之外，还有慎二。真嗣是无敌的，只要他在，我就不可能输。

Besides I have more to fight for this time. They took him away from me. They tricked him, they used him as a tool. They have to die.  
除此之外，这次我还有更多要争取的事情。他们把他从我身边带走了。他们欺骗他，把他当作工具。他们必须死。

"Hey Shinji, you see that? Those bastards are back."  
“嘿真嗣，你看到了吗？那些混蛋回来了。”

_"Y-Yeah… I see them Asuka."  
“是、是啊……我看到他们了明日香。”_

"So, nine unit's. Tell me, what's your sync ratio Third?"  
“那么，九个单位。告诉我，你的第三同步比是多少？”

_"Umm… eighty five point seven two…"  
“嗯……八十五点七二……”_

"Shame, mine is eighty second point seven two. As always just a step behind. Guess I'll be taking on five and you'll be taking on four. Are you ready?"  
“真遗憾，我的成绩是八十秒七二。一如既往，只落后一步。我猜我会挑战五，而你会挑战四。你准备好了吗？”

---

I nod and ready myself to attack. The nine Units are still high up in the air circling the Angel. I wonder when they're going to start to lower themselves to our level. They continue to circle and I see a mass of clouds suddenly move in blocking the sun and casting a shadow on us all. I glance down at the readings inside the Eva and see the outside temperature has suddenly dropped.  
我点点头，准备进攻。九个单位仍然高高地围绕着天使。我想知道他们什么时候会开始降低自己的水平到我们的水平。他们继续盘旋，我看到一大团云突然移动，挡住了阳光，给我们所有人投下了阴影。我低头看了一眼 Eva 内部的读数，发现外面的温度突然下降了。

It's nearly April and the outside temperature has suddenly dropped to nearly zero degrees Celsius. Is this the work of the Angel?  
已近四月，室外气温骤然降至近零摄氏度。这是天使的杰作吗？

_"What the hell is this? It's affecting the weather?"  
“这到底是什么？影响天气了？”_

As she speaks I see the first white flakes fall to the ground. I can't help but be amazed at the sight of it. Snow is falling in Tokyo-3.  
当她说话时，我看到第一片白色的雪花落到地上。看到这里，我不禁感到惊讶。第三东京正在下雪。

"Asuka are you seeing this it's… snowing?"  
“明日香你看到了吗，现在……正在下雪？”

My visibility reduces somewhat as the snow begins to fall at a quicker pace. It's already beginning to lay in front of me. As I look up I can still see the white Unit's circling the Angel. They're getting closer.  
随着雪开始以更快的速度落下，我的能见度有所下降。它已经开始展现在我的面前。当我抬头时，我仍然可以看到白色的单位正在围绕着天使。他们越来越近了。

_"Yeah I see it but… this is impossible. It shouldn't… wait look out they're coming!"  
“是的，我明白了，但是……这是不可能的。不应该……等一下，他们来了！”_

---

I watch as the first of the white Evangelion Units approaches the ground. Without giving Shinji time to respond I rush forward. As soon as it hits the ground I leap and I grab the bastard by its jaws. Its jaws snap open spraying the blood of the Eva everywhere and casting a red mark onto the freshly laid snow.  
我看着第一批白色的新世纪福音战士单位接近地面。不给真嗣反应的时间，我就冲了上去。它一落地，我就跳了起来，抓住了这个混蛋的下巴。它的嘴巴猛地张开，伊娃的鲜血喷得到处都是，在新铺的雪地上留下了一道红色的印记。

Wasting no time I quickly hoist the Eva over my head and I rip the beast in half with Unit 02s hands. A torrent of blood flows over my cockpit screen and pools around the base of Unit 02. I throw it down onto the floor and reach for my shoulder pylon where my progressive knife has just appeared. I bring the knife down into the beast armour exposing the core and this time I'm going to ensure I destroy it completely. I'm not going to get caught out like I did last time.  
我不浪费时间，迅速将伊娃举过头顶，用 02 号部队的双手将这头野兽撕成两半。一股血流从我的驾驶舱屏幕上流过，并在 02 号机组的底部聚集。我把它扔到地板上，伸手去够我的肩塔，那里我的渐进刀刚刚出现。我把刀插入野兽盔甲中，露出核心，这一次我要确保完全摧毁它。我不会像上次那样被抓住。

I keep a close eye on it as it writhes in agony. Sparks and blood gush out of it as finally the core changes from illuminated to nothingness and finally shatters. I stand up straight and smile before whispering.  
我密切关注着它，因为它在痛苦中翻滚。火花和鲜血从其中喷涌而出，最终核心从光明变为虚无，最后破碎。我站直身子，微笑着低声说道。

"Erste" “第一”

---

I can't help but be amazed at how well Asuka handles her Evangelion. She's always been good but it has been months since she last piloted so I wasn't expecting her to be as good as this. Especially after what had happened last time she piloted. Yet what else should I expect from her? She's perfect.  
我不禁对明日香处理新世纪福音战士的出色表现感到惊讶。她一直都很好，但自从她上次驾驶以来已经有几个月了，所以我没想到她会这么好。尤其是在她上次驾驶发生了那件事之后。但我还能对她抱有什么期待呢？她很完美。

I turn my attention from her to watch as three white Units take their place in front of me. As if frightened by the quick death of their comrade they seem apprehensive to attack me. They're staying a firm distance from me, backing away slightly and clutching their lances. A frightened Evangelion, it is possible I suppose. They're human after all.  
我把注意力从她身上移开，看着三个白色单位在我面前就位。他们似乎害怕同伴的快速死亡，害怕攻击我。他们与我保持着一定的距离，稍微后退并握紧了长矛。我想，有可能是受惊的新世纪福音战士。他们毕竟是人类。

I withdraw my knife from the Evangelions shoulder pylon and assume a defensive stance. I see the three Units in front of me. The two on either side have parted from the middle one as if trying to surround me. Without giving them a chance to progress further I dash forward at the one in the middle. I raise the knife high and leap into the air.  
我从新世纪福音战士的肩塔上拔出刀，摆出防御姿势。我看到我面前的三个单位。两边的两个人都和中间的人分开了，好像要包围我一样。我不给他们进一步前进的机会，就冲向中间的那个。我高高举起刀，跳到空中。

There is a mighty crash as I bring the knife down upon the Evangelion just as it raises its lance to block me. I back away and take a swing at the beast but it's able to parry me with no problem. Sparks fly from where our weapons meet. I swing again but it manages to dodge out of the way and counters me with a down swipe of its lance. I'm able to just get out of the way before it tears into my armour.  
当新世纪福音战士举起长矛阻挡我时，我把刀砍向了它，发出了一声巨大的撞击声。我向后退去，向那头野兽挥出一拳，但它毫无问题地招架了我。我们的武器相遇处火花四溅。我再次挥舞，但它设法躲开了，并用长矛向下挥击来反击我。我能够在它撕裂我的盔甲之前闪开。

Now we stand with only a slight distance between us. I have my knife raised defensively and it has the lance prepared. I'm aware of the other two Units circling us ready to leap at me at any opportunity. Yet I know they won't, they risk hurting their friend if they do. If I stay close to it then they won't attack me.  
现在我们站在一起，彼此之间只有一点距离。我防御性地举起了刀，长矛也准备好了。我知道另外两支部队正围绕着我们，随时准备向我扑来。但我知道他们不会，如果这样做，他们就有伤害朋友的风险。如果我靠近它，他们就不会攻击我。

It goes for a horizontal swing with the lance. I jump backwards and bring up the knife to try to deflect the lance. More sparks fly and pain shoots through my arms at the sheer force of the lance hitting the knife.  
它用于用矛进行水平摆动。我向后跳去，举起刀试图偏转长矛。更多的火花飞溅，长矛击中刀子的巨大力量让我的手臂感到疼痛。

In the background I can hear similar sounds coming from Asuka in Unit 02. Her voice comes across my communications system.  
在背景中，我可以听到第二单元的明日香发出类似的声音。她的声音通过我的通讯系统传来。

_"God damnit these knives are useless for this sort of thing. Couldn't they have built us a weapon that can change form? Like one handed for when we need it but can stand to two handed and long range?"  
“该死的，这些刀对这种事毫无用处。他们难道不能为我们制造一种可以改变形态的武器吗？就像我们需要时用一只手，但可以承受两只手和远距离的攻击？”_

I grin as I realize what she is referring to. It's perhaps not good to think about that in battle but we acquired a games console from that supermarket and there is a game on it we used to play together. Some of the weapons in it had two forms, a one handed version and a two handed version. I agree with her, the axe from that game would be very useful right now.  
当我意识到她指的是什么时，我笑了。在战斗中考虑这一点也许不太好，但我们从那家超市买了一台游戏机，上面有一个我们以前一起玩的游戏。里面的一些武器有两种形式，单手版本和双手版本。我同意她的观点，那场比赛中的斧头现在非常有用。

Although it does give me an idea. I move towards the white unit and thrust my blade forward just a little bit. I bring it back and watch what it does with its lance. It raises the lance into the air and just as it starts its downswing I roll past the Eva managing to get around its back. Almost immediately I get to my feet and I bring the knife around the Units throat and slice cleanly. Blood erupts from the Evas neck and spray forward onto the snow. I feel it fall backwards and as it does I bring the blade down on the Units mid-section and plunge the blade through. Just like with Asuka a shower of blood spurts upwards and eventually the core is destroyed silencing the unit.  
虽然它确实给了我一个想法。我向白色机体移动，将刀刃稍微向前推了一点。我把它带回来，观察它用长矛做什么。它把长矛举到空中，就在它开始向下挥杆时，我从伊娃身边滚过，设法绕过了它的背部。我几乎立刻站了起来，把刀架在单位的喉咙上，干净利落地切开。鲜血从伊瓦斯的脖子中喷涌而出，向前喷射到雪地上。我感觉到它向后落下，当它落下时，我将刀片放在装置的中部并将刀片插入。就像明日香一样，一股血雨向上喷射，最终核心被摧毁，单位陷入沉默。

I bring Unit 01 to full height and whisper back to Asuka.  
我将 01 号机调到最大高度，然后低声告诉明日香。

"Zweite." “兹维特。”

---

I'm a little bit confused but it sounds like Shinji actually enjoyed that. That's a first. It's a shame I couldn't witness it but I'm a bit pre-occupied with fighting three of these bastards at the same time. Unlike Shinji who seems to have gotten the defensively minded Units, mine are a touch on the aggressive side, deciding to take it in turns to take swings at me with their lances and not giving me a chance to recuperate.  
我有点困惑，但听起来真嗣真的很喜欢这样。这是第一次。很遗憾我没能亲眼目睹，但我有点全神贯注于同时与这三个混蛋战斗。与真嗣不同，真嗣的单位似乎具有防御性，而我的单位则偏向攻击性，决定轮流用长矛攻击我，不给我恢复的机会。

If only I had something with a longer range I might be able to fight back but as it is this crappy knife just isn't doing the job. What was the point of that anyway? Develop these giant beasts and give them a small dagger to combat enemies with. Surely a sword or something would have been better.  
如果我有射程更远的东西，我也许能够反击，但因为这把蹩脚的刀根本无法完成这项工作。无论如何，那有什么意义呢？培养这些巨兽并给它们一把小匕首来对抗敌人。当然如果有一把剑什么的会更好。

I dodge out of the way of another horizontal swing from the Unit to my left. It's immediately followed by a downswing from the Unit to my right. I quickly duck out of the way of that only to have to leap over another horizontal swing from the central Evangelion Unit.  
我躲开左侧单位的另一次水平摆动。紧随其后的是我右侧单位的下杆。我迅速闪开，却不得不跳过新世纪福音战士中央单位的另一个水平秋千。

"Scheisse these bastards are organized."  
“谢瑟这些混蛋是有组织的。”

I can't keep dodging like this, eventually I'm going to get hit or my cable is going to be cut. I need to think of other options. I suddenly remember one of the little tricks this Eva was equipped with. I duck under another horizontal swing from the Unit to my right. This time however I jump backwards and bring my shoulder just in line with its face. I wait just a moment and fire. I watch as a sequence of spikes are hurled forward from Unit 02s shoulder pylon directly into the white Evangelions face. It reels back for a moment as the spikes force their way through its grotesque smiling face.  
我不能一直这样躲闪，最终我会被击中，或者我的电缆会被切断。我需要考虑其他选择。我突然想起这个伊娃所拥有的一个小技巧。我躲在右侧单位的另一个水平秋千下。然而这一次我向后跳，让我的肩膀正好与它的脸成一条直线。我等了一会儿就开火了。我看到一连串的尖刺从 02 号部队的肩塔直接扔到新世纪福音战士的白色脸上。当尖刺强行穿过它那张怪诞的笑脸时，它向后退了一会儿。

Taking my opportunity I move around to its side whilst it's stunned and I grab for its lance forcing it out of the beasts' hands.  
我抓住机会走到它的身边，趁它被击晕的时候，我抓住它的长矛，将它从野兽手中逼了出来。

"My turn!" “轮到我了！”

I give it no opportunity to reply and instead swing horizontally at its leg, slicing it clean off. Its two friends back away as I bring the lance down on its shoulder slicing the arm off this time. Now for the kill. I raise the lance again and slice the Evangelion clean through the middle making sure I cut the core clean in half. Both sides of the Evangelion call to either side as more of the snow is covered in thick red blood.  
我没有给它任何反应的机会，而是水平地挥动它的腿，将它彻底切掉。当我把长矛放在它的肩膀上，这次把它的手臂切下来时，它的两个朋友向后退了一步。现在开始杀戮。我再次举起长矛，将新世纪福音战士从中间切开，确保将核心切成两半。随着越来越多的雪被厚厚的红色血液覆盖，新世纪福音战士的双方互相呼唤。

New weapon in hand I look at the two Evangelions in front of me. Their aggression seems to have been turned down a notch now that I have a new toy to place with. I'm not letting go of it this time. Sweat is starting to pour down my face as I grin and reply to Shinji.  
新武器在手 我看着面前的两个新世纪福音战士。现在我有了一个新玩具，他们的攻击性似乎已经降低了一个档次。这次我不会再放手了我笑着回答真嗣，汗水开始从我的脸上流下来。

"Dritte" “德里特”

---

Two of the Units still haven't found their way to the ground yet. I'm aware of them still circling the large Angel in the centre but I'm more concerned with the two that are attacking me right now. When I killed their friend it seems to have increased their ferociousness and they're taking swing after swing at me.  
其中两个单位还没有找到到达地面的路。我知道他们仍然围绕着中心的大天使，但我更关心现在正在攻击我的两个。当我杀了他们的朋友时，他们似乎更加凶猛了，他们不断地向我挥拳。

I manage to dodge one swing but I'm immediately caught by the blunt side of one of the lances. I scream out in pain as I fall to the floor.  
我设法躲开了一击，但立即被其中一根长矛的钝边抓住。当我倒在地板上时，我痛苦地尖叫起来。

_"Shinji are you alright!"  
“慎二你没事吧！”_

Rolling out of the way to avoid a downwards thrust from one of the Units I give my reply to her, "Fine, just got caught by one of them. How are you doing?"  
我滚到一边以避免其中一个单位向下的推力，我回答她：“好吧，刚刚被其中一个单位抓住了。你怎么样？”

_"Two out of five down here, going well…"  
“五分之二在这里，进展顺利……”_

I can hear the anger and frustration in her voice coupled with the hefty footsteps of her Evangelion dodging out of the way of the attacks from the two she is currently engaged with. I roll out of the way of another attack and quickly scramble to my feet. Asuka was right, fighting with this knife against the lances they brandish just isn't going to work.  
我可以听到她声音中的愤怒和沮丧，还有她的新世纪福音战士沉重的脚步声，躲避着她目前正在处理的两个人的攻击。我滚开，避开另一次攻击，然后迅速爬起来。明日香是对的，用这把刀对抗他们挥舞的长矛是行不通的。

I feel immense pain in my shoulder from where I was caught before and look around the landscape. In the distance I can see the Eva I took out earlier. I can see the lance it dropped when it fell. I throw my progressive knife forward towards one of the Evas coming towards me and run towards it. I don't care where it hits the Eva but I distract it enough to rush forward and grab the fallen lance.  
我从之前被抓到的地方感到肩膀剧痛，环顾四周。远处我可以看到我之前拿出来的伊娃。我可以看到它掉落时掉落的长矛。我将我的渐进刀向前扔向其中一个向我走来的伊娃，然后朝它跑去。我不在乎它击中了伊娃的哪里，但我足以分散它的注意力，让它冲上前去抓住掉落的长矛。

One of the Evangelions seems to have chased me. I barely have time to ensure I've grabbed the lance before I see it bearing down on me. I quickly roll onto my back and bring the lance up to deflect its downswing. Sparks fly and pain shoots through my hands from the impact.  
其中一名新世纪福音战士似乎在追赶我。我还没来得及确定自己已经抓住了长矛，就看到它向我袭来。我迅速翻身仰面，举起长矛以偏转其向下挥舞的方向。火花飞溅，撞击使我的双手感到疼痛。

I scramble backwards as it swings down again. I keep the lance raised to block its swing. Once again it comes down only this time it keeps pushing trying to force the blade closer and closer to me. I can feel it lightly touching the armour around Unit 01s head.  
当它再次向下摆动时，我向后爬去。我保持长矛举起以阻止其摆动。它再次落下，只是这一次它继续推动，试图迫使刀片越来越靠近我。我能感觉到它轻轻触碰了 01 号部队头部周围的装甲。

I grip my controls tightly and try with everything I have to push back against it. I send Unit 01s foot out wildly but I'm unable to catch the Eva. It continues to push at me trying to cut through the armour of the head. I yell out as the blade begins to cut through. I can feel something trickling down my forehead and I hope it's just sweat.  
我紧紧地握住控制装置，并尝试尽一切努力来抵抗它。我疯狂地将01号的脚伸出来，但我无法抓住伊娃。它继续推着我试图刺穿头部的盔甲。当刀片开始切开时我大喊一声。我能感觉到有什么东西从我的额头上流下来，我希望那只是汗水。

I scream out and keep on trying to push forward. I lash out again with my leg and look up just in time to watch the head of the white Unit come flying clean off. My eyes widen in surprise as the force of it pushing suddenly subsides. Without any hesitation and fighting through the pain in my head I finally kick the Eva off of me and slice upwards with the lance slicing it clean through the middle. Just like Asuka did before I make sure to destroy the core.  
我尖叫着，继续努力向前推进。我再次用腿猛击，抬头正好看到白色单位的头部飞了出去。我惊讶地睁大了眼睛，因为它的推力突然减弱了。我毫不犹豫地克服了头部的疼痛，最终将伊娃从我身上踢开，并用长矛向上切，从中间将其切开。就像明日香之前所做的那样，我确保摧毁核心。

Slowly I stagger to my feet and see Unit 02 standing their gripping its own lance tightly. I can sense Asuka inside there smiling at me. She protected me, she saved my life. I smile back and our voices are in sync with one another.  
我慢慢地踉踉跄跄地站了起来，看到02号部队站在那里，紧紧地握着自己的长矛。我能感觉到明日香在里面对我微笑。她保护了我，她救了我的命。我回以微笑，我们的声音彼此同步。

"Vierte" “维埃尔特”

---

Four down five to do. I take my position alongside Shinji and watch as the two hovering Evangelion Units finally make their way down to the surface to join their three comrades in front of us. The snow is still falling and has settles across the Geofront. Around us is a trail of destruction. Sections of the land stained with the blood of the Evas. Armour and body parts cast aside. It's a real warzone.  
四下五做。我站在真嗣旁边，看着两个盘旋的新世纪福音战士终于降落到地面，与我们前面的三个战友会合。雪仍在下，并已覆盖整个地缘区。我们周围是一条毁灭的痕迹。部分土地沾满了埃瓦人的鲜血。盔甲和身体部位被扔到一边。这是一个真正的战区。

Inside my entry plug I'm breathing heavily, I'm covered in sweat. I'm not used to this, I haven't had to pilot in months. I didn't think I would have to ever again. I'm hardly unfit but I'm just not used to this. I imagine Shinji is exactly the same is his entry plug. I look up at the slowly rotating patterned Angel above us. We're not even half way through this yet.  
在我的入口塞内，我呼吸沉重，浑身是汗。我不习惯这个，我已经好几个月没有试飞了。我认为我不必再这样做了。我并不是不适应，只是我不习惯这样。我想象真嗣和他的入口插头是一模一样的。我抬头看着我们上方缓慢旋转的天使图案。我们还没有完成一半。

---

There is nothing I can do but watch and hope that they win. The three of us are sat watching from the edge of the Geofront. Watching as the blizzard comes down across the former site of Tokyo-3 and watching as Asuka and Shinji fight to ensure our survival. I clutch my necklace tightly and hope that they can do it.  
我无能为力，只能看着并希望他们获胜。我们三个人坐在地缘前沿的边缘观看。看着暴风雪席卷第三东京的旧址，看着明日香和真嗣为确保我们的生存而战斗。我紧紧抓住我的项链，希望他们能做到。

They've taken down four of the Eva series so far but now they have five left in front of them. The battle isn't even halfway to being done. I wish there was some way to help them, to get some support out to them. To contact them or give them advice but I can't. I'm completely powerless, I just have to put my faith in them.  
到目前为止，他们已经拿下了《伊娃》系列的四部作品，但现在他们还剩下五部作品。战斗还没有完成一半。我希望有一些方法可以帮助他们，为他们提供一些支持。联系他们或给他们建议，但我不能。我完全无能为力，我只能相信他们。

I turn and see Fuyutsuki looking on, a concerned look on his face.  
我转过身，看到冬月在一旁看着，脸上露出关切的表情。

"You alright old man?" “老头你没事吧？”

He narrows his eyes at me, I don't think he appreciated being called old man but there is no chain of command anymore. I can get away with it.  
他眯起眼睛看着我，我认为他不喜欢被称为老人，但已经没有指挥系统了。我可以摆脱它。

"They're making sure to destroy the cores this time."  
“他们这次一定要摧毁核心。”

I nod, "Yeah I noticed that, overkill maybe but I suppose it means they won't get up."  
我点点头，“是的，我注意到了，也许有点过头了，但我想这意味着他们不会站起来。”

I look out across the battlefield again, no one has made a move yet. Asuka and Shinji are on one side, the five Mass Produced Eva's on the other. I don't know a lot about the battle last time aside from the fact that Asuka lost. I had already left this realm by that point. Fuyutsuki and the others however got a good view of it.  
我再次向战场望去，还没有人出手。明日香和真嗣在一侧，五个量产型伊娃在另一侧。除了明日香输了之外，我对上次的战斗了解不多。那时我已经离开了这个领域。然而冬月他们却看得很清楚。

"So… what happened when Asuka fought them last time?"  
“那么……明日香上次和他们战斗时发生了什么？”

His head lowers for a moment, "It was… It was my responsibility. I didn't tell her to take out the cores and the regenerative abilities of the Eva series kicked in. Before we knew it she had ran out of power and the series revived itself. If I had told her…"  
他低着头，“是……是我的责任。我没让她取出核心，伊娃系列的再生能力就开始发挥作用。不知不觉间，她的力量就耗尽了，如果我告诉她的话，系列就会自行复活……”

"She still would have ran out of power… you shouldn't blame yourself."  
“她还是会耗尽力量……你不应该责怪自己。”

"It is hard not to, there is a lot I should have done different Katsuragi. This battle was one of them. I knew about the Eva series abilities and even about the lances they carry yet I didn't relay any of that information to Asuka. There was opportunity to do so"  
“很难不这样做，有很多事情我应该做不同的葛城。这场战斗就是其中之一。我知道伊娃系列的能力，甚至他们携带的长矛，但我没有将任何信息传递给明日香有机会这样做”

I didn't think I'd see the day in which Fuyutsuki expressed regret for his actions. He never seemed to show any sort of emotion in NERV except for annoyance and anger. I always assumed regret was beyond him but since I came back I've had to change that view. I've had to see him in a different light now. Someone who like all of us regrets their actions and wants to make amends.  
我想我不会看到冬月对自己的行为表示后悔的那一天。除了烦恼和愤怒之外，他在NERV中似乎从未表现出任何情绪。我一直以为他不会后悔，但自从我回来后，我不得不改变这种看法。我现在必须用不同的眼光来看待他。喜欢我们所有人的人对自己的行为感到后悔并想要弥补。

I do feel some anger towards him for what he did, how can I not? His actions nearly led to the end of the world. People died and suffered because of his actions, or at least his inaction. Yet I think of what Asuka told me about Shinji, that Third Impact was punishment enough for our actions. How can Shinji so easily forgive people, any of us? I should have done more for him and Asuka yet I didn't.  
我确实对他的所作所为感到有些愤怒，我怎么能不愤怒呢？他的行为几乎导致了世界末日。人们因他的行为或至少是他的不作为而死亡和受苦。然而我想起明日香告诉我关于真嗣​​的话，第三次冲击对于我们的行为来说已经是足够的惩罚了。真嗣怎么能轻易原谅别人，我们任何一个人？我本应该为他和明日香做更多的事，但我没有。

I look ahead again and I see Unit's 01 and 02 move backwards and wonder what they're going to do next.  
我再次向前看，看到 01 号和 02 号部队向后移动，想知道他们接下来要做什么。

---

_"Hey Shinji, dya remember the first Angel we fought together?"  
“嘿真嗣，还记得我们一起战斗的第一个天使吗？”_

I shudder at the memory of it, it wasn't my finest moment in front of other people. That plugsuit looks good on Asuka, not so much on me.  
我一想起那件事就不寒而栗，那不是我在其他人面前的最美好的时刻。这套紧身衣穿在明日香身上很好看，但穿在我身上就不太好看了。

"Yeah… I do, on the ship?"  
“是啊……我知道，在船上？”

There is a pause followed by a laugh, _"No! Not that one you idiot, I mean the first one we fought together properly. Remember what we had to do for it?"_  
停顿了一下，然后笑了起来，“不！不是那个白痴，我是说我们第一次正确地一起战斗。还记得我们为此做了什么吗？”

I shudder again at the memory of that. Again learning to dance is not one of my finest moments. We had to do everything together that week. Eat together, sleep in the same room, study, watch television and of course dance together so we could be in perfect sync with one another. I didn't know Asuka much back then, I thought she was loud, obnoxious and a pain to deal with. Yet at the same time it was in that week I started to fall for her.  
想起那件事我又不寒而栗。再说一次，学习跳舞并不是我最美好的时刻之一。那周我们必须一起做所有事情。一起吃饭、睡在同一个房间、学习、看电视，当然还有一起跳舞，这样我们就能完美地同步。那时我不太了解明日香，我觉得她很吵闹、令人讨厌而且很难对付。但与此同时，就在那一周我开始爱上她。

"Yeah I remember." “是的，我记得。”

_"Good, the centre Unit take a look at it."  
“好，中心单位看一下。”_

I look ahead of me and see the central Eva is hanging behind the other four. The Units to its immediate right and left have moved forward somewhat. On the far sides the Units have spread out a bit trying to surround us.  
我向前看，看到中间的伊娃挂在其他四个人的后面。紧邻其右侧和左侧的部队已向前移动了一些。在远处，部队已经分散开来试图包围我们。

"I see it…" “我看到了…”

_"Ok so this is what we're going to do. Back away slightly then run forward. We'll use the two to its immediate sides to springboard up into the air then bring our lances down on it, making sure we get those cores. Then at the same time we transform the lances and throw them at this point.  
“好吧，这就是我们要做的。稍微后退一点，然后向前跑。我们将使用它旁边的两个跳板到空中，然后将我们的长矛放在它上面，确保我们得到那些核心然后我们同时变换长矛并在此时投掷。_

She sends over a data transmission to Shinji, it highlights the point on the Unit's armour that protects the power core.  
她向真嗣发送了一条数据传输，突出显示了部队装甲上保护动力核心的点。

_'You got that?" “你明白了吗？”_

Asuka's plan flies through my mind. I mentally trace out the path but fear suddenly grips me. For that sort of thing last time we had a week to practice being in sync with one another. We haven't had any time at all for this!  
明日香的计划在我脑海中闪过。我在心里描绘出道路，但恐惧突然抓住了我。上次为了这类事情，我们花了一周的时间练习彼此同步。我们根本没有时间做这个！

I also wonder about transforming the lance. I know these things can change form but I don't know how to do it. Does Asuka?  
我也想知道如何改造长枪。我知道这些东西可以改变形式，但我不知道该怎么做。明日香有吗？

"Uhh…" “呃……”

_"Good, on three then!" “好，那就三点吧！”_

"But…" “但…”

_"One…" “一…”_

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

_"Two"_

"The lances!" “长矛！”

_"Three!" “三！”_

To hell with it. Casting aside my doubts I sprint forward at the same time as Asuka. Our footsteps thunder through the snow as we make our way towards our targets. I listen for Asuka to give the signal.  
见鬼去吧。抛开疑虑，我和明日香同时向前冲刺。当我们朝着目标前进时，我们的脚步声雷鸣般地穿过雪地。我聆听明日香发出的信号。

_"JUMP NOW!" “现在跳！”_

Without any hesitation I get Unit 01 to leap up into the air. I watch as the white Evangelion below me misses with a horizontal swing. It lurches forward just as Asuka predicted it would and just in time for Unit 01 to begin its descent.  
我毫不犹豫地让01号机跳到了空中。我看着下方的白色新世纪福音战士水平摆动，没有击中目标。它像明日香预测的那样向前倾斜，正好赶上了 01 号机开始下降的时间。

We land on the back of the two Units and immediately leap back up in the air gaining more height. I sneak a look to my right and see Unit 02 matching my exact height and speed. We're in complete sync with each other, it's exactly as it was last time.  
我们降落在两个单位的后面，并立即跳回空中以获得更高的高度。我偷偷地看向右边，看到 02 号机组与我的高度和速度完全一致。我们彼此完全同步，就像上次一样。

We both bring our weapons up at the same time aiming for the centre of the Eva. I ready myself to land as both of our lances collide simultaneously with the head of the Unit. It has no time to relax as we slice through it making two clean vertical cuts through it decimating it completely. I hear the core inside shattering but take no time to stop and confirm it.  
我们同时举起武器瞄准伊娃的中心。当我们的两根长矛同时与小队的头部碰撞时，我做好了着陆的准备。当我们切开它时，它没有时间放松，做了两次干净的垂直切割，彻底摧毁了它。我听到里面的核心破碎，但没有时间停下来确认。

I still don't know how to make this thing transform. Do I just think it and it transforms? Do I just throw it? I quickly look across at Asuka and see Unit 02 pulling the lance back so I do the same, I throw it at the target and watch as it starts to twist and change shape mid-flight. It goes from being the long white lance it was previously and is now transformed into the red forklike Lance of Longinus.  
我还是不知道如何让这东西转变。我只是想它然后它就改变了吗？我就直接扔掉它吗？我迅速看向明日香，看到 02 号机把长矛拉了回来，所以我也做了同样的事情，我把它扔向目标，看着它在飞行中开始扭曲和改变形状。它从之前的白色长枪，变成了红色叉状的朗基努斯之枪。

With ease it pierces through the armour and into the core of my target and I watch as blood gushes from the cracks in the armour and the Unit drops to its knees.  
它轻松地刺穿了盔甲，进入了我目标的核心，我看着鲜血从盔甲的裂缝中涌出，单位跪倒在地。

---

I smile as the Unit drops down dead and run over to retrieve the lance.  
当这个小队倒地身亡并跑过去取回长矛时，我微笑了。

"Fünfte, sechste and siebte."  
“第五、第六、第七。”

Two Units to go. I didn't think that would work as well as it did but to give credit to me, I am amazing. Shinji was pretty good as well I guess, maybe a step or two behind me but still good. Mama is protecting me just like I knew she would.  
还剩两个单位。我认为这不会那么有效，但要归功于我，我太棒了。我想真嗣也相当不错，虽然可能比我落后一两步，但仍然不错。妈妈正在保护我，就像我知道她会那样。

_"ASUKA WATCH OUT!" 「阿苏卡小心！」_

"Huh?" “嗯？”

I spin around just in time to see a lance flying at me. Instantly I raise my A.T. Field and halt its progress. My power is still running but a familiar pang of fear strikes my heart as I watch the weapon twist into the replica lance of Longinus. I keep my field in place but I know it won't hold up, these weapons are made to pierce A.T. Fields.  
我猛地转身，正好看到一根长矛朝我飞来。我立刻提高了我的 A.T.场并停止其进展。我的力量仍在运转，但当我看着武器扭曲成朗基努斯的复制长矛时，一种熟悉的恐惧感袭上心头。我保持我的领域，但我知道它不会坚持下去，这些武器是为了刺穿 A.T.字段。

I'm reminded straight away of what happened in my last battle against these things. It's the same thing again and I prepare myself for the pain. My stomach tightens into a knot and my eyes widen, it can't end like this again, not again.  
我立刻想起了我上次与这些东西的斗争中发生的事情。又是同样的事情，我做好了承受痛苦的准备。我的胃一紧，我的眼睛睁大，不能再这样结束了，不能再这样了。

Just as I see it start to pierce through my A.T. Field I see a purple blur past me and snatch it out of the way. I instantly breathe a sigh of relief. Shinji… Shinji saved me. Just in time, he saved me.  
就在我看到它开始刺穿我的 A.T 时。我看到一团紫色的模糊物从我身边经过，我把它拉开。我顿时松了一口气。真嗣……真嗣救了我。他及时救了我。

His voice comes over the radio. There is panic in his voice but also a hint of relief.  
他的声音从收音机里传来。他的声音里有一丝惊慌，但也有一丝宽慰。

_"Asuka… are you alright?"  
“明日香……你没事吧？”_

"Yeah… fine. Let's get these two bastards and then kill the Angel."  
“是啊……好吧。我们先抓住这两个混蛋，然后杀掉天使。”

_"Right!" “正确的！”_

Only two Evangelions are left, that is one each and I don't think they'll give us too much trouble. In truth they aren't tough enemies but the numbers and abilities they have make them formidable. Regenerative abilities and S2 engines make them tougher than the average Evangelion. Yet they're piloted by a dummy plug, a puppet being piloted by another puppet. They can't fight like we can, they can't communicate like we're able to and that gives us the advantage.  
只剩下两辆新世纪福音战士了，各一辆，我认为他们不会给我们带来太多麻烦。事实上，他们并不是强敌，但他们的数量和能力使他们令人畏惧。再生能力和 S2 引擎使它们比一般的新世纪福音战士更加坚韧。然而它们是由一个虚拟插头驾驶的，一个木偶由另一个木偶驾驶。他们不能像我们一样战斗，他们不能像我们一样沟通，这给了我们优势。

That's how it has always been. Me, Shinji and even Ayanami were at our best when we were all on the same page. When we were all friends. The moment that fell apart, the moment of the twelfth Angel when Shinji went against the plans and I started to doubt myself. That was when things went wrong.  
一直都是这样。当我、真嗣甚至绫波意见一致时，我们都处于最佳状态。当我们都是朋友的时候。崩溃的那一刻，第十二天使的那一刻，真嗣违背了计划，我开始怀疑自己。就在那时，事情出了问题。

The Angel's before that we were amazing. I realize that now, we drew off of each other to be better pilots. Shinji got better because of me and I got better because of him. Yet I never realized that then, I was so determined to be better than everyone else I lost sight of that. Well not this time.  
天使之前我们都很棒。我现在意识到，我们互相取长补短，成为更好的飞行员。真嗣因为我而变得更好，我也因为他而变得更好。然而我从来没有意识到，当时我是如此坚定地想要比其他人都更好，但我却忘记了这一点。好吧，这次不是。

I've got Mama watching over me, I've got my A.T. Field and I have Shinji. There is no way we can lose!  
我有妈妈在看着我，我有我的 A.T.菲尔德和我还有真嗣。我们不可能输！

I get Unit 02 back on its feet. I rush forward towards the now weaponless Evangelion and along the way throw my own lance. It hits the Evangelion directly in the chest. I approach the lance at full speed and hold out both hands and push the lance further through the Eva. Blood gushes out again as I edge closer to its midsection.  
我让 02 号部队重新站起来。我向现在手无寸铁的新世纪福音战士冲去，并沿途投出了自己的长枪。它直接击中了新世纪福音战士的胸部。我全速接近长矛，伸出双手，将长矛进一步推入伊娃。当我靠近它的中部时，血液再次涌出。

As I approach the core I release my grip on the lance and ready Unit 02s hand into a fist and bring it crashed down armour. There is a huge sound of steel on steel as my fist collides with the armour. I bring the fist down again and scream out as it causes a dent in the armour. Small cracks appear at the edges allowing me to take hold and rip the armour plating off and expose the innards of the Unit. I see the power core and bring my fist down again. I put everything I have into it. This is for Shinji, this is for those people out there and this is for me. The girl you bastards killed and tore apart. Just like the others it too shatters and the Eva crashes to the ground. I turn just in time to see Shinji dealing with the last one.  
当我接近核心时，我松开了对长矛的抓握，准备将 02 号部队的手握成拳头，然后将其击落到装甲上。拳头与铠甲碰撞，发出巨大的钢与钢的声音。我再次挥出拳头，并尖叫起来，因为它在盔甲上留下了凹痕。边缘出现小裂缝，让我能够抓住并撕掉装甲板并暴露该装置的内部结构。我看到了能量核心，再次放下了拳头。我把我所有的一切都投入其中。这是给真嗣的，这是给外面的人的，这是给我的。那个女孩被你们这些混蛋杀死并撕碎了。就像其他的一样，它也破碎了，伊娃坠落到了地上。我转身正好看到真嗣正在处理最后一个。

My breathing is heavy, sweat is still dripping from all parts of me. I survey the landscape and see the blood splattered ground. It's patchy now that fresh snow has covered it. All nine of the Eva series lay silent on the ground. We did it. We won.  
我的呼吸很粗重，汗水还在从我的各个部位滴落。我环顾四周，看到血溅满地。现在新雪覆盖了它，现在它已经变得斑驳不堪。伊娃系列的九只都静静地躺在地上。我们做到了。我们赢了。

---

"They did it…" “他们做到了……”

I say the words aloud allowing them to become more real. Joy rushes through me as I watch the Unit 01 and Unit 02 stand triumphantly over the last of the Eva series. I know it's not over yet but they actually managed to beat all nine of them. It was perfect, it was amazing! I always knew what they were capable of if they were on the same page, I saw glimpses of it before Third Impact before everything got messed up.  
我大声说出这些话，让它们变得更加真实。当我看到 Unit 01 和 Unit 02 胜利地战胜了 Eva 系列的最后一部时，喜悦涌上心头。我知道比赛还没有结束，但他们实际上击败了全部九人。太完美了，太棒了！如果他们意见一致，我总是知道他们能做什么，在第三次冲击之前，在一切变得一团糟之前，我就瞥见了这一点。

I still have so many questions, how did Shinji get from the complex to here. Why are the two Evangelion Units here? When they shouldn't be but that that can wait. All that matters is Asuka and Shinji are winning.  
我还有很多疑问，真嗣是怎么从综合楼来到这里的。为什么新世纪福音战士的两个部队会在这里？当他们不应该这样做的时候，但可以等待。重要的是明日香和真嗣获胜。

I allow myself to smile and turn to look at both Fuyutsuki and Rebecca. Both of them are looking slightly more cautious. Rebecca is crouched next to a radio, I notice she is wearing an earpiece and she seems to be listening intently to something.  
我微笑着转身看向冬月和丽贝卡。两人的神情都显得更加谨慎。丽贝卡蹲在收音机旁边，我注意到她戴着耳机，似乎正在专心听着什么。

Finally she looks up at us both.  
最后她抬头看着我们俩。

"My people have sent word from Europe. The U.N. issues an alert to the governments of the world regarding another Impact level event happening on the site of Tokyo-3. Mass evacuations are happening in major cities just as they did in December."  
“我的人民从欧洲发来消息。联合国向世界各国政府发出警报，称第三东京基地发生了另一起影响级别的事件。主要城市正在发生大规模疏散，就像去年 12 月那样。”

"They… They know what is happening here?"  
“他们……他们知道这里发生了什么？”

She shakes her head and continues, "No, a group related to SEELE have managed to stage a takeover of NERV Germany and Great Britain. They're leaking information to major news stations right now about what is happening, they're issuing a warning that the completion of human instrumentality is imminent."  
她摇摇头，继续说道：“不，一个与SEELE有关的组织已经成功地接管了NERV德国和英国。他们现在正在向主要新闻台泄露正在发生的事情的信息，他们正在发出警告人类的工具性即将完成。”

"So they're making more of a public statement of it than SEELE ever did. Interesting."  
“所以他们比 SEELE 做过更多的公开声明。有趣。”

"Indeed, the world-press are running a feed of what is happening here. The rest of the world just saw that battle."  
“事实上，世界媒体正在报道这里正在发生的事情。世界其他地方刚刚看到了那场战斗。”

"You mean… they have cameras here?"  
“你是说……他们这里有摄像头？”

I look around and try to look for signs of any other people but see absolutely nothing, as far as I can see it is only us three, the Angel and the two Eva's.  
我环顾四周，试图寻找其他人的踪迹，但什么也没看到，据我所知，只有我们三个人，天使和两个伊娃。

"Why are they doing this? What do they hope to gain by being so public?"  
“他们为什么要这样做？他们希望通过如此公开获得什么？”

Rebecca shrugs, "I don't know, maybe they see this as a situation they can't lose. I've got my people reaching out to the U.N. as we speak, offering whatever help we can. It's not easy, SEELE were very careful to cover their tracks and the U.N. is having a tough time accepting our word."  
丽贝卡耸耸肩，“我不知道，也许他们认为这是一个他们不能失去的局面。在我们说话的时候，我已经让我的人向联合国伸出援手，提供我们能提供的一切帮助。这并不容易，SEELE非常小心地掩盖他们的踪迹，联合国很难接受我们的话。”

"Kyoto University, my old office."  
“京都大学，我以前的办公室。”

The two of us slowly turn our heads towards Fuyutsuki who has remained silent until this moment.  
我们两个慢慢地把头转向一直保持沉默的冬月。

"Huh?" “嗯？”

"In my old office in Kyoto, one of the walls in there is a trick wall. Behind it is a safe, inside that is a disc that contains all of my original notes on SEELE and the Human Instrumentality Project before I joined Gehirn. It has names, plans and the truth behind everything. It was… it should provide your people with what they need to convince the U.N."  
“在我位于京都的旧办公室里，其中一堵墙是一堵诡计墙。它后面是一个保险箱，里面有一张光盘，里面有我加入 Gehirn 之前关于 SEELE 和人类工具计划的所有原始笔记。它有名字、计划和一切背后的真相……它应该为你们的人民提供说服联合国所需的东西。”

There is a pause and finally she nods.  
停顿了一下，最后她点点头。

"I understand." “我明白。”

I look between the two of them, "So… what happens next?"  
我看着两人，“那么……接下来会发生什么？”

"That depends on if Shinji and Asuka are able to defeat that thing up there. If they do then we prepare to fight on a different front, in front of politicians. Even with the proof we give them they will still call everything into question."  
“这取决于真嗣和明日香是否能够击败那里的那个东西。如果他们做到了，那么我们就准备在不同的战线上，在政客面前战斗。即使我们向他们提供了证据，他们仍然会对一切提出质疑。 ”

I smirk, "That's more your field I feel."  
我傻笑着说：“我觉得那更像是你的领域。”

"Perhaps, but I am afraid they are unlikely to consider me a reliable person to speak to. My association with Gendo Ikari will be used against me and they will potentially see me as an accessory to it all. My input will probably be limited."  
“也许吧，但我担心他们不太可能认为我是一个可靠的人。我与碇源堂的关系将被用来对付我，他们可能会认为我是这一切的从犯。我的投入可能会受到限制。 ”

I know he is right and I offer no further input. I look ahead to Asuka and Shinji and just hope that I can protect them from it all. Once they've done this I'll get them to safety, I'll keep them away from all of that. If I have to sit and face politicians and leaders and generals all day I'll do it.  
我知道他是对的，我没有提供进一步的意见。我期待着明日香和真嗣，只希望我能保护他们免受这一切的伤害。一旦他们完成了这件事，我就会把他们带到安全的地方，我会让他们远离这一切。如果我必须整天坐着面对政客、领导人和将军，我会这么做。

"Somethings happening…" “有事情发生……”

I look ahead on hearing those words and see the Angel moving downwards.  
听到这些话，我向前看，看到天使向下移动。

---

Neither of us have said anything since we beat the last of the Eva series. Out communications channel has been open the whole time and all that has filled it is the sound of our heavy breathing as we try to catch our breath. I wipe my forehead with the back of my hand and there is now a red stain on the back of my glove from the blood that is slowly trickling down.  
自从我们击败了《伊娃》系列的最后一部之后，我们谁都没有说过任何话。通讯通道一直处于开放状态，充满了我们试图喘口气时沉重的呼吸声。我用手背擦了擦额头，手套背面出现了一道红色的血迹，血慢慢地流了下来。

I look out of the cockpit and I see Unit 02 stood in front of me, I wonder if she is doing the same. I'm hit with a sense of apprehension again and I wonder what she is thinking. I know that this world is real now, I know that what I experienced was fake. It was a world catered to look like my own after the twelfth Angel and I fell for it.  
我向驾驶舱外望去，看到02号机就站在我面前，我不知道她是否也在做同样的事情。我再次感到恐惧，不知道她在想什么。我知道现在这个世界是真实的，我知道我所经历的都是假的。这是一个在第十二天使之后看起来像我自己的世界，我爱上了它。

I think back across those twenty days and I know I was probably given signs throughout it. I think about Kaworu's words throughout it about not being able to redo things and I wonder if this was him trying to put those thoughts in my mind.  
我回想起那二十天，我知道我可能在整个过程中都得到了暗示。我想起了薰在整个过程中所说的关于无法重做的事情，我想知道这是不是他试图将这些想法放在我的脑海中。

Then there were the two incidents when we were finally brought together again. I rejected her and told her she wasn't the real Asuka. I ran away, so convinced by the false reality that I rejected everything.  
然后发生了两件事，我们终于又聚在一起了。我拒绝了她并告诉她她不是真正的明日香。我逃跑了，因为对虚假的现实深信不疑，所以我拒绝了一切。

There is another thing as well that I recall. While I was there things popped into my mind that I couldn't have possibly known or for no good reason.  
我还记得一件事。当我在那里时，一些我不可能知道或没有充分理由的事情突然出现在我的脑海中。

"Asuka…" “明日香……”

_"…Yes?" “…是的？”_

"D-Did you… when I was in the coma did you play music for me?"  
“你、你……在我昏迷的时候有给我放音乐吗？”

The video feed pops up and I'm greeted instantly by her shocked and happy face, "Y-You heard that?"  
视频弹出，我立刻看到她震惊而快乐的脸，“你、你听到了吗？”

_"I… I think so, I woke up once in that place with The Musical Box in my head and another time there was… a song about a Jester…"  
“我……我想是的，有一次我在那个地方醒来，脑子里有音乐盒，还有一次……一首关于小丑的歌……”_

"Y-You actually heard them? I… Yes! I did!"  
“你、你真的听到了？我……是的！我听到了！”

---

I burst out into a smile at hearing him say that. He actually heard the music I was playing for him, it had an effect on him even a small one.  
听到他这么说，我突然笑了。他实际上听到了我为他演奏的音乐，这对他产生了影响，即使是很小的影响。

"On evenings I… came and spoke to you and played music for you. It seemed stupid but… I… I didn't think you'd actually hear it."  
“晚上我……过来和你说话，为你演奏音乐。这看起来很愚蠢，但是……我……我没想到你真的会听到。”

His video feed pops up and I'm ecstatic to see his face again. He's breathing heavily, his face covered in sweat and there is some blood trickling from his forehead but he's there. He is real and he is my Shinji.  
他的视频弹出，我很高兴再次看到他的脸。他呼吸粗重，脸上满是汗水，额头上还流着血，但他还在那里。他是真实的，他是我的真嗣。

There is so much I want to say to him, so much I want to do to him but just as I'm about to say something the ground suddenly begins to shake. I try to move the Evangelion away but I'm unable to. As I look down I see a black circle opening up below us.  
我有很多话想对他说，有很多话想对他做，但正当我要说些什么时，地面突然开始震动。我试图把新世纪福音战士移开，但我做不到。当我向下看时，我看到我们下面有一个黑色的圆圈。

"Shit" “拉屎”

I try to move Unit 02s legs but they aren't moving. I'm trapped sinking into this Angel like its quicksand. It's exactly what happened to Shinji during the fight against the twelfth. Only this time it's taking the two of us. I shut down the video feed for a moment and I start to laugh.  
我尝试移动 02 号部队的腿，但它们一动不动。我像流沙一样陷入了这个天使的困境。这正是真嗣在与第十二人的战斗中所发生的事情。只是这一次需要我们两个人。我关掉了视频源一会儿，然后开始大笑。

I should have seen it coming. I really should have done, the fight against the Eva's was little more than a distraction. Now it's going to take us into itself and complete what it needs to do. After all that we failed. We actually fucking failed.  
我应该预见到它的到来。我真的应该这样做，与伊娃的战斗只不过是一种干扰。现在它将带我们进入它自己并完成它需要做的事情。毕竟我们失败了。我们真的他妈的失败了。

No, we can't have done. We can't fail. We're not fucking allowed to fail. It's not fair. I grip the Lance I'm still carrying tightly in Unit 02s hand and throw it towards the rotating Angel. It hovers for a moment before passing into and being absorbed by the Angel. No effect, I should have known. My heart is pounding but I'm still laughing.  
不，我们做不到。我们不能失败。我们他妈的不允许失败。这不公平。我紧紧握住02号手中还握着的长枪，将它扔向旋转的天使。它盘旋了一会儿，然后进入并被天使吸收。没有效果，我早该知道的。我的心在狂跳，但我还在笑。

I look across as Unit 01 and see its arms thrashing about wildly. Shinji will be screaming in there and yelling. I couldn't protect him, after all this time I failed yet again. The girl who nearly caused the end of the world months ago is about to be a catalyst for it yet again.  
我望向对面的 01 号部队，看到它的手臂疯狂地摆动。真嗣会在那里尖叫、大喊。我没能保护他，毕竟这一次我又失败了。几个月前差点引发世界末日的女孩即将再次成为世界末日的催化剂。

I look up, "Well Mama… I guess, this is good bye isn't it? I know this would be the last time I would see you but… I didn't expect this. I know you tried to protect me and I know you were watching over me but I guess somethings you just can't protect. Guess I'm just like you in the end."  
我抬起头，“好吧，妈妈……我想，这是再见了，不是吗？我知道这将是我最后一次见到你，但是……我没想到会这样。我知道你试图保护我，我我知道你在注视着我，但我猜有些东西你无法保护，我猜我最终会像你一样。”

I look across at Unit 01 again, it's still thrashing about and I open up the communications channel again. I can hear Shinji yelling. Eventually he gives up and he looks towards me. I lower my head and mutter so he can't hear me.  
我又看了一眼对面的 01 号机，它还在剧烈地晃动，我再次打开了通讯频道。我听见真嗣在喊叫。最终他放弃了，他看着我。我低下头小声嘀咕，以免他听不到我的声音。

"Goodbye Mama, I'm going over there to be with him. I'll… see you later I guess."  
“再见，妈妈，我要去那里陪他。我想我……稍后再见。”

I'm strangely calm knowing that I'm about to die and this world is about to end but I guess it won't be so bad.  
我出奇地平静，知道我即将死去，这个世界即将终结，但我想事情不会那么糟糕。

Above the two of us nailed to her cross is Lilith. The source of life for this planet. As of this moment she is dormant, barely alive only serving to secrete the orange liquid the people of this place call LCL. This is the second time I have stood before Lilith. The first was when I thought it was Adam when I had the intention of ending this world and allowing myself to life on after being led to believe that was the true path for humanity.  
在我们两个被钉在十字架上的是莉莉丝。这个星球的生命之源。此刻她正处于休眠状态，几乎没有生命力，只负责分泌橙色液体，这个地方的人称之为LCL。这是我第二次站在莉莉丝面前。第一次是当我以为是亚当的时候，当我被引导相信这是人类的真正道路后，我打算结束这个世界并让自己继续生活。

It of course was not, it was a boy who changed all that for me. A boy called Shinji Ikari who changed things for everyone. There is a girl stood next to me. She has stood before Lilith a number of times and the last time she become joined with the being. She too rejected her role having been brought up to fulfil a singular purpose. She turned on her creator and father figure. That was all because she had met Shinji Ikari who changed things for her.  
当然不是，是一个男孩为我改变了这一切。一个名叫碇真司的男孩改变了所有人的生活。我旁边站着一个女孩。她曾多次站在莉莉丝面前，最后一次与莉莉丝结合。她也拒绝接受自己的角色，因为她是为了实现一个单一的目标而长大的。她转向了她的创造者和父亲形象。这一切都是因为她遇到了改变她一切的碇真嗣。

Now the two of us stand before Lilith again. We are stood here of our own free will this time having made a decision to help that boy and the one he loves to save this world.  
现在我们两个人再次站在莉莉丝面前。这次我们自愿站在这里，决定帮助那个男孩和他所爱的人拯救这个世界。

I reach out my hand and it brushes against hers. Our fingers intertwine as we begin to float upwards towards the beings face.  
我伸出手，它擦过她的手。当我们开始向上漂浮到众生的脸上时，我们的手指交织在一起。

I turn to the girl. Rei Ayanami, the first child. She is like me, harbouring an otherworldly soul and artificial. Except she is not exactly like me. She is not alone in this world. There exists another out there. A Rei Ayanami who emerged from the sea of LCL just like Asuka and Shinji did yet not in the same location. A Rei Ayanami who is aware of what has been happening here but has been unable to do anything. A Rei Ayanami who will cease to be when this is over. A Rei Ayanami who deserves a shot at happiness herself.  
我转向女孩。绫波丽，第一个孩子。她就像我一样，拥有超凡脱俗的灵魂和人造的。只是她不完全像我。她在这个世界上并不孤单。那里还存在另一个。与明日香和真嗣一样，从拼箱之海中出现的绫波丽却并不在同一个地方。绫波丽知道这里发生的事情，但却无能为力。当这一切结束后，绫波丽将不复存在。绫波丽本人也值得尝试一下幸福。

Rei is not aware of this cruel fate in store for her and she doesn't have to be. I won't allow it to happen. I will allow Rei to have the life she deserves.  
丽没有意识到这种残酷的命运正在等待着她，她也不必意识到。我不会允许这种事发生。我会让丽过上她应得的生活。

"The forbidden fusion of Adam and Lilith is about to happen again."  
“亚当和莉莉丝的禁忌融合即将再次发生。”

"Ikari and Sohryu need us."  
“碇和苍龙需要我们。”

With those words we are pulled into the progenitor of life. Everything turns to light around me. I am home. I see the image of Rei Ayanami fade away and dissolve into LCL. I thank you Rei for giving me this chance to give you all the happiness you deserve. May you forgive me and enjoy your life.  
有了这些话，我们就被拉进了生命的起源。我周围的一切都变得光明。我在家。我看到绫波丽的形象逐渐消失，消失在拼箱中。我感谢 Rei 给我这个机会给你所有你应得的幸福。愿你原谅我并享受你的生活。

"ASUKA!" “飞鸟！”

I frantically pull at my controls trying to move Unit 01 but it's no use. We're both sinking into the Angels body just like I did during the twelfth.  
我疯狂地拉动控制器试图移动 01 号单元，但没有用。我们都陷入了天使的身体，就像我在第十二次时所做的那样。

"COME ON! MOVE MOVE MOVE YOU BASTARD! DO SOMETHING!"  
“来吧！动起来，动起来，你这个混蛋！做点什么！”

I thrash at the controls even more. I look at the video feed and see Asuka muttering something to herself. Finally her eyes open and she looks at me.  
我更加猛烈地敲击控制器。我看着视频，看到明日香自言自语着什么。最后她睁开了眼睛，看着我。

_"Eject your plug ever so slightly like you did against the fourth Angel."  
“像对付第四位天使那样轻轻地弹出你的插头。”_

"Y-You know what I did against the fourth?"  
“你、你知道我对第四个做了什么吗？”

_"Of course I do you idiot, I watched the tapes when I was in Germany! Now do it! We don't have much time!"  
“我当然做你这个白痴，我在德国的时候就看过录像带了！现在就做吧！我们时间不多了！”_

I don't ask any more questions as the feed immediately cuts off. Instead I eject the plug to half way and open the hatch. I scramble out of my seat and go to the door just in time to see the Entry Plug for Unit 02 eject itself. The hatch on it opens and I immediately see Asuka standing there. She looks across at me and nods.  
我没有再问任何问题，因为信号立即中断。相反，我将插头弹出一半并打开舱门。我从座位上爬起来，走到门口，正好看到 02 单元的入口插头自行弹出。它的舱门打开，我立即看到明日香站在那里。她看着我，点点头。

"If you don't catch me, I am going to haunt you for the rest of your life. Do you understand?"  
“你要是不抓到我，我就会缠着你一辈子，明白吗？”

I get barely any chance to reply as she backs away and takes a running jump towards my Entry Plug. I hold out my hands ready to catch her but she manages to land in the plug with minimal problems. I close the hatch and I look at her. I want to hold her, to throw myself at her and kiss her. It's really her, the real one this time in front of me.  
我几乎没有机会回答，她就退后一步，跳向我的入口插头。我伸出双手准备接住她，但她几乎没有遇到什么问题就成功地落在了插头上。我关上舱门，看着她。我想拥抱她，想扑向她，亲吻她。真的是她，这次出现在我面前的是真实的她。

I can't do any of that though. My feet freeze as I try to take a step forward. My mouth goes dry as I try to speak. I don't have the right to do that. Not after all I've done for the past twenty five days. Instead I back away from her and return to the seat in the cockpit and sit down.  
但我什么也做不到。当我试图向前迈出一步时，我的脚僵住了。当我试图说话时，我的嘴变得干燥。我没有权利这样做。毕竟我过去二十五天所做的一切都不是。相反，我从她身边退开，回到驾驶舱的座位上坐下。

I hear her take a step around to me and she looks around curiously.  
我听到她向我走了一步，她好奇地环顾四周。

"So… this is Unit 01 huh? Is… is she in here too?"  
“所以……这里是01号部队吧？她……她也在这里吗？”

I turn to face her, "Huh?"  
我转身面对她：“嗯？”

"Your mother… she's in here isn't she? Right now?"  
“你妈妈……她就在这里，不是吗？现在？”

I lower my eyes, "Yeah… she is."  
我垂下眼睛，“是啊……她是。”

There is a pause as Asuka comes around to my side and kneels down near to me. Her hands run over mine as she grips the controls of the Eva with me.  
停顿了一下，明日香走到我身边，在我身边跪下。当她和我一起握住 Eva 的控制装置时，她的手抚过我的手。

"Asuka… what are we… what's your plan?"  
“明日香……我们是什么……你有什么计划？”

I look ahead as the Evangelion continues to sink further downwards, in less than a minute it'll be completely covered. I suddenly realize that there is no plan. Asuka looks as me and confirms as much.  
我向前看，新世纪福音战士继续向下沉，不到一分钟它就会被完全覆盖。我突然意识到没有计划。明日香看起来和我一样，也确认了这一点。

"I… I don't have a plan Shinji. I just didn't want to be alone."  
“我……我没有计划，真嗣。我只是不想一个人呆着。”

We both release our hands on the controls and I look up at her reaching a gloved hand up to her face and slowly caressing her cheeks. She does the same to me and brings herself in closer towards me.  
我们都松开了控制装置上的手，我抬头看着她伸出戴着手套的手放在她的脸上，慢慢地爱抚她的脸颊。她对我也做了同样的事，让自己离我更近了。

"Shinji… I'm scared." “真嗣……我很害怕。”

"Me too…" “我也是…”

Finally we're completely submerged in the Angel. The Entry Plug is in complete darkness for a moment until the emergency lights come on in the Entry Plug. Only a few hours of life support in here. She looks out into the void and then back to me.  
最后我们完全沉浸在天使之中。入口插头暂时处于完全黑暗状态，直到入口插头中的应急灯亮起。这里只有几个小时的生命支持。她望向虚空，然后又看向我。

"Do you think we'll get thr-"  
“你认为我们会成功吗——”

### Chapter 24 A Change Of Seasons
"They-They're gone…" “他们、他们走了……”

We look on as both Units finally sink into the large black pool formed underneath the Angel. I feel a hand rest itself on my shoulder as I drop to my knees. Asuka and Shinji are gone, taken in by the Angel. My mouth goes dry and I feel so very numb.  
我们看着两个单位最终沉入天使下方形成的黑色大池中。当我跪下时，我感觉到一只手搭在了我的肩膀上。明日香和真嗣消失了，被天使收留了。我的口干舌燥，感觉非常麻木。

This can't be the end, they can't have been defeated that easily. Not after all that they have done. I don't know what to do now, I don't know what we can do but we have to do something. We can't let them be beaten that easily.  
这不可能是结局，他们不可能那么容易被击败。毕竟他们已经做了那么多事。我不知道现在该怎么办，我不知道我们能做什么，但我们必须做点什么。我们不能让他们那么容易被打败。

"Misato…" “美里……”

It's Rebecca's voice, there is a shakiness in it that I recognize all too well. It's the one I used to have when I saw Shinji hurt in battle. When I saw Asuka being assaulted by the Angel in orbit. The one I had when Kaji shown me Lilith under NERV. It's the voice of someone who is supposed to stay strong for others but can't anymore because they realize they're ultimately powerless.  
这是丽贝卡的声音，里面有一种我太熟悉的颤抖了。这是我以前看到真嗣在战斗中受伤时所拥有的。当我看到明日香在轨道上被天使攻击时。当卡吉向我展示 NERV 下的莉莉丝时我看到的那张。这是一个本应为他人保持坚强的人的声音，但现在却不能了，因为他们意识到自己最终无能为力。

We were all powerless. Fuyutsuki in his quest for redemption, giving us that information and caring for the sick all this time was powerless. Rebecca was powerless in her question to carry on her brother's legacy and put a stop to SEELE once and for all. I was powerless in my quest to actually show those two that someone gave a shit and could protect them.  
我们都无能为力。冬月在寻求救赎、向我们提供信息并一直照顾病人的过程中却无能为力。丽贝卡在她的问题中无力继承她哥哥的遗产并一劳永逸地阻止SEELE。我无力向这两个人表明有人在乎并可以保护他们。

I look up at Fuyutsuki, "How much time?"  
我抬头看向冬月，“还有多少时间？”

Fuyutsuki's face has a grim expression, "Sohryu jumped into Unit 01 before they were both taken under. Under normal circumstances maybe 12-13 hours but with two of them in there less than half of that. Maybe five hours."  
冬月的脸色阴沉起来，“小柳在他们俩都被占领之前就跳进了01号。正常情况下可能需要12-13个小时，但他们两个在里面的话就不到一半了。也许是五个小时。”

I feel Rebeccas hand take itself off of my shoulder. She wanders back to her radio, I can't make out what she is saying. She is speaking in German, I can make out a few words here or there. After a few minutes she eventually returns to us.  
我感觉到丽贝卡的手从我的肩膀上松开了。她又回到收音机前，我听不清她在说什么。她说的是德语，我能辨认出一些单词。几分钟后，她终于回到了我们身边。

"They found your package Professor, they are trying to send support to our location but there seems to be something preventing them from getting close. They'll keep trying to update us as time goes on."  
“他们找到了你的包裹，教授，他们正试图向我们所在的位置发送支持，但似乎有什么东西阻止他们接近。随着时间的推移，他们会继续尝试向我们通报最新情况。”

I allow myself a small smile, "Tell them thank you."  
我微微一笑，“告诉他们谢谢你。”

I know no matter what they send it'll be of no use. They can send all the N2 mines they want, all the helicopters and fighter jets or soldiers but in the end only an Eva can defeat an Angel and we're fresh out of them now.  
我知道无论他们送什么都没用。他们可以派出他们想要的所有 N2 地雷、所有直升机、战斗机或士兵，但最终只有 Eva 可以击败天使，而我们现在刚刚摆脱了他们。

---

"-through this?" “——通过这个？”

I finish my sentence just as the light around me subsides. I'm no longer in the entry plug, Shinji is no longer here with me. Instead I'm in a field, not one I recognize. I'm stood on a path and around me are fields of sunflowers. Some of them up to my neck but further back I can see ones that tower over me. I look upwards and the sky is a brilliant blue, no clouds to speak of and there is only a gentle breeze to take the edge off of the heat,  
当我周围的光芒消退时，我说完了这句话。我已经不在入口处了，真嗣也不再在我身边了。相反，我身处一个我不认识的领域。我站在一条小路上，周围是向日葵田。其中一些高至我的脖子，但在更远的地方，我可以看到那些高耸在我身上的东西。抬头望去，天空蔚蓝，万里无云，只有微风吹过，驱散了炎热，

As I look down I see I'm no longer in my plugsuit, I'm wearing my yellow sundress. The same one I wore when I first met Shinji on the carrier. I ended up tearing this one apart during one of my fits of rage before Third Impact. I always liked this dress.  
当我低头一看时，我发现我不再穿着紧身衣，而是穿着黄色背心裙。和我第一次在航母上见到真嗣时穿的那一样。在第三次冲击之前，我在一次愤怒中最终把这个撕碎了。我一直很喜欢这件衣服。

I look around and everything here feels so real but I know it isn't. I know this is a world of illusion. I know that my real body is still in that Entry Plug. I wonder if Shinji is here too, wondering where I am. Maybe he is experiencing a different place to me. I can't stay here, I have to get back.  
我环顾四周，这里的一切都感觉那么真实，但我知道事实并非如此。我知道这是一个虚幻的世界。我知道我的真实身体还在那个入口插头里。我想知道真嗣是否也在这里，想知道我在哪里。也许他正在经历与我不同的地方。我不能留在这里，我必须回去。

What went wrong? I think back to the first time I ever met Shinji. I had heard of him through Kaji. The amazing Shinji Ikari who had taken down two Angels without any help. He had taken out a third in an epic sniper battle. The saviour of Tokyo-3 and of course the Commanders son. How I hated hearing that. While I was lingering in Germany chasing after a grown man with no interest in me Shinji was fighting and probably being praised for it. This little brat who out of nowhere was suddenly getting the spotlight that should have been mine. I was the one who had been training for years, I was the one who had sacrificed everything.  
什么地方出了错？我回想起第一次见到真嗣的情景。我是通过加治听说过他的。令人惊叹的碇真司在没有任何帮助的情况下击倒了两名天使。他在一场史诗般的狙击战中拿下了第三个。第三东京的救世主，当然还有指挥官的儿子。我多么讨厌听到这个。当我在德国徘徊追逐一个对我不感兴趣的成年男人时，真嗣正在战斗，并且可能因此而受到赞扬。这个不知从何而来的小家伙突然受到了本应属于我的关注。我是那个训练了很多年的人，我是那个牺牲了一切的人。

At that time I had my college degree, I was an able pilot able to synchronise with my Eva to a high level. I had even done some basic combat drills. We of course didn't know what the Angels were going to be like so it was against versions of the Eva. I was secure, I had no friends or family but I didn't need that. I was fine, except for the nightmares every night.  
那时我已经获得了大学学位，我是一名能够与我的 Eva 同步到高水平的优秀飞行员。我什至还进行了一些基本的战斗训练。我们当然不知道天使会是什么样子，所以这是针对伊娃版本的。我很安全，没有朋友或家人，但我不需要。我很好，除了每晚都做噩梦。

Then I had to meet Shinji. Stupid invincible Shinji. Shy to the point of being cute, kind to the point of being annoying and just like me. A person who was looking for purpose in this unfair world and felt everyone was just out to use them. A person who had lost everything.  
然后我不得不去见真嗣。愚蠢的无敌真嗣。害羞到可爱，善良到烦人，就像我一样。一个在这个不公平的世界中寻找目标的人，并觉得每个人都只是为了利用它们。一个失去一切的人。

I had to meet him. I had to fight with him. I had to live with him and I had to suffer with him and because of him. I had to fall in love with him. Only I hated myself for falling for him. I wasn't supposed to do that. I could never need someone. I only needed myself. I lied to myself constantly and lashed out and pushed him away. I became abusive until the whole thing fell apart. I became so vile I nearly ended the world. He was going to end the world for me. Its romantic when you think about it, Shinji really would do anything for me.  
我必须见见他。我不得不和他战斗。我必须和他一起生活，我必须和他一起受苦，并因为他而受苦。我不得不爱上他。只是我恨自己爱上了他。我不应该那样做。我永远不需要有人。我只需要我自己。我不断地对自己撒谎，猛烈地斥责他，把他推开。我开始辱骂，直到整个事情崩溃。我变得如此卑鄙，几乎毁灭了世界。他要为我终结世界。想想就觉得很浪漫，真嗣真的愿意为我做任何事。

So we came back. There was only the two of us for six weeks. I had lost my purpose in life, my Eva but I had a new purpose. To turn away from that Asuka. To accept that I needed people and to look after and protect Shinji.  
所以我们回来了。六个星期里只有我们两个人。我失去了我的人生目标，我的伊娃，但我有了一个新的目标。转身离开那个明日香。接受我需要人的事实，并照顾和保护真嗣。

I fucked it all up again. He got shot because I ran away. He spent twenty five days in a fantasy world conjured up by an Angel. I couldn't do anything again. I had tried to change but because of me this is happening. The end of the world is here again, Asuka Langley Sohryu is the catalyst for it yet again.  
我又把这一切搞砸了。因为我逃跑，他被枪杀了。他在天使创造的幻想世界里度过了二十五天。我又无能为力了。我曾试图改变，但因为我，这一切才发生。世界末日再次来临，明日香·兰利·素留再次成为世界末日的催化剂。

I start to walk down the path hoping that it can lead me out of this place. As I walk I hear a rustling sound near to me. I quicken up my pace and get the feeling I'm not alone in this place. As I continue walking the feeling that someone is nearby and watching me grows. I start to walk faster breaking into a jog but every few steps I hear the rustling get more intense. Whatever or whoever it is is now matching my pace.  
我开始沿着小路走，希望它能带我离开这个地方。当我走路时，我听到附近有沙沙的声音。我加快了脚步，感觉这里并不孤单。当我继续行走时，有人在附近看着我的感觉越来越强烈。我开始加快脚步，开始慢跑，但每走几步，我就听到沙沙声变得更强烈。无论是谁，现在都在配合我的步伐。

Finally I stop, tired of this game. If I have to fight I'll fight, this thing is clearly not going to give up and I can't run forever. I'm getting sick of tricks and illusions.  
最后我停下来，厌倦了这个游戏。要打我就打，这东西显然不会放弃，我也不能永远逃跑。我已经厌倦了诡计和幻想。

"Fine, you got me. Show yourself."  
“好吧，你抓住我了。展示一下你自己吧。”

More rustling and I prepare myself for a fight. I'm shocked to hear a giggle and finally a small girl comes running out into the path. She looks like… me. She's got on a cute little red dress, her hair is done the same way mine is now and she's smiling. Is this really me?  
沙沙声更大了，我做好了战斗的准备。我很震惊地听到一声咯咯笑声，最后一个小女孩跑到了小路上。她看起来像……我。她穿着一件可爱的红色小裙子，她的头发和我现在的头发一样，她在微笑。这真的是我吗？

She giggles again, "That was fun!"  
她又咯咯笑起来：“真有趣！”

I'm unsettled but I return some form of smile, I kneel down to her level.  
我有些不安，但我也报以某种微笑，然后跪到她的高度。

"Hey, what are you doing here?"  
“嘿，你在这里做什么？”

"Playing!" “玩啊！”

"Oh really, are you all alone?"  
“哦，真的吗，你一个人吗？”

She shakes her head vigorously in that way that young kids do, "Nop! Mama is here! She said she was waiting for someone. She said if I played here I might get to meet them! Are you them?"  
她像小孩子一样用力摇头，“不！妈妈在这里！她说她在等人。她说如果我在这里玩，我可能会见到他们！你是他们吗？”

This girl… her mama… waiting for someone. Does she really mean me? I look down the path again and I can see a large tree at the end of the path. My mouth goes dry at the thought of what could be at the end of the path. I'm brought back to reality by the tiny voice speaking and a tugging at my dress.  
这个女孩……她的妈妈……在等一个人。她真的是说我吗？我再次顺着小路往下看，发现小路的尽头有一棵大树。一想到路的尽头会发生什么，我就感到口干舌燥。微小的声音和拉扯我衣服的声音把我拉回了现实。

"Are you k?" “你好吗？”

I bend down and smile, "I don't think so but I am a bit lost. Can you take me to your mama please?"  
我弯下腰微笑道：“我不这么认为，但我有点迷失。你能带我去找你妈妈吗？”

"I think you're her! Come on!"  
“我想你就是她！来吧！”

She starts to turn but I call out to her before she can, "Oh… I forgot to ask, I'm Asuka… what's your name?"  
她开始转身，但我在她转身之前喊道，“哦……我忘了问，我是明日香……你叫什么名字？”

She turns round with a wide smile, "I'm Asuka too! Come on! Mama is waiting!"  
她转过身来，笑容满面，“我也是明日香！快点吧！妈妈在等着呢！”

I'm in darkness but I'm aware that I'm floating. It's warm here so it can't be the Entry Plug. It gets cold in there but where am I? Eventually something comes into view, it's a street but not one that I recognize. I slowly glide down onto the street and instantly the warmth has gone replaced by a bitter wind that nips at my cheeks. I look around, it's sometime in the evening and the street is empty lit by a small number of lamps. There are a few shops and houses on either side, some with their lights on.  
我身处黑暗，但我知道我正在漂浮。这里很热，所以不可能是入口插头。那里很冷，但我在哪里？最终，有东西映入眼帘，那是一条街道，但我不认识。我慢慢地滑到街上，立刻温暖就消失了，取而代之的是吹过我脸颊的寒风。我环顾四周，已是傍晚时分，街上空荡荡的，只有几盏灯亮着。两边有一些商店和房屋，有的还亮着灯。

Snow begins to fall around me, I start to rub my arms to get a bit of warmth in them. The snow is pretty in this light but I'm too cold to stop and admire it. I have to get to somewhere warm, my plugsuit isn't made to keep the warmth in. As I walk down this street I steal glances in the windows, I can see figures inside moving around.  
雪花开始落在我周围，我开始摩擦我的手臂，以获得一点温暖。在这个光线下雪很漂亮，但我太冷了，无法停下来欣赏它。我必须去一个温暖的地方，我的连体衣不是为了保暖而设计的。当我走在这条街上时，我偷偷地看了一眼窗户，我可以看到里面有人在走动。

I come to a crossing and a car moves past me slowly. The driver turns to look at me as they go past and shoots me an odd glance. I avert my gaze and quickly cross when I'm able to. Another gust of wind blows through and I shiver as snow blows all around me.  
我来到一个十字路口，一辆车慢慢地从我身边驶过。当他们经过时，司机转头看着我，奇怪地看了我一眼。我会移开目光，并在可能的情况下迅速移开视线。又一阵风吹过，我浑身发抖，雪花在我周围飞舞。

I used to be fascinated by the idea of snow at one point. In a memory hidden within me I remember my mother promising to show it to me once. I remember seeing it in text books and old footage. This weather that Japan used to get but doesn't anymore because of our eternal summers. As I keep walking in it I'm slowly losing my fascination. The boots of my Plugsuit don't cling to the pavement properly so I'm sliding a lot. It's cold and my nose keeps on running.  
我曾经一度对雪的想法很着迷。在我内心深处的一段记忆中，我记得我母亲答应过要把它展示给我一次。我记得在教科书和旧镜头中看到过它。日本曾经有过这种天气，但由于我们永远都是夏天，所以现在已经不再有这种天气了。当我继续走在其中时，我慢慢失去了对它的迷恋。我的 Plugsuit 的靴子不能很好地粘在人行道上，所以我经常打滑。天气很冷，我的鼻子一直在流鼻涕。

I wonder where I am exactly. I don't recognize this area at all, it's a small town. Everything is in Japanese but I don't recognize anything. It's like when I wandered around Tokyo-3 shortly after arriving there. I have that same sense of fear within me. It's all so unrecognizable.  
我想知道我到底在哪里。我根本不认识这个地区，这是一个小镇。一切都是日文的，但我什么也不认识。就像我刚到第三东京不久就在附近闲逛一样。我内心也有同样的恐惧感。一切都是那么的难以辨认。

As I walk I try to think of something else to distract myself from the cold. I wish I hadn't because my mind keeps on reverting to the same subject and feelings. It's going back to Asuka, it's going back to my feelings of guilt and shame over what happened. For years I had thought I'd be alone and that no one would love me. I felt like I never deserved to be loved. I can't explain why but it's always been there, a perpetual voice in the back of my head telling me I didn't deserve to be loved. That my mother's death was somehow my fault and that my father abandoning me was my own fault.  
当我走路的时候，我试着想点别的事情来分散自己的注意力，远离寒冷。我希望我没有这样做，因为我的思绪不断回到同一个主题和感受上。它又回到了明日香，回到了我对所发生的事情的内疚和羞耻感。多年来我一直以为我会孤独一人，没有人会爱我。我觉得我从来不值得被爱。我无法解释为什么，但它一直存在，在我的脑后有一个永恒的声音告诉我，我不值得被爱。我母亲的死在某种程度上是我的错，而我父亲抛弃我则是我自己的错。

I encased myself in those feelings and when someone would try to approach I got scared so I'd keep my distance. I thought the only reason they'd want to be friends with me was because they wanted something and that eventually they'd just grow to see how bad a person I was. It's funny because to my memory I never did anything bad. I was average in school, I never stole anything and I never talked back to people. I tried to be polite and I guess I was a little bit shy. I just kind of existed though. Yet I always had that voice in the back of my head telling me I was a coward and that I didn't deserve to be loved.  
我把自己包裹在这种感觉中，当有人试图接近时，我很害怕，所以我会保持距离。我认为他们想和我做朋友的唯一原因是因为他们想要一些东西，最终他们会发现我是一个多么糟糕的人。这很有趣，因为据我记忆，我从来没有做过任何坏事。我在学校表现很一般，我从不偷过任何东西，也从不跟人顶嘴。我试图保持礼貌，但我想我有点害羞。但我只是存在过而已。然而我的脑海里总是有那个声音告诉我我是个胆小鬼，我不值得被爱。

My arrival in Tokyo-3 that started to change, people tried to get close to me and instead of going when I tried to push them away they rejected that and pushed back. So I finally had some friends in Touji and Kensuke and I had a guardian who loved me in Misato. The voice was always there though and one day I met Asuka.  
当我到达第三东京时，情况开始发生变化，人们试图接近我，但当我试图将他们推开时，他们拒绝了并反击，而不是走开。所以我终于有了一些朋友——东司和健介，还有一个爱我的监护人——美里。但那个声音一直存在，有一天我遇到了明日香。

We fought together and we grew close. Yet our own fears engulfed us and we began to push each other away. She would lash out at me and yell and I'd regress into my shell. We hurt each other through our actions until one day it finally came to a climax.  
我们一起战斗，我们的关系越来越亲密。然而我们自己的恐惧吞噬了我们，我们开始互相推开。她会对我大喊大叫，然后我就会退回到自己的壳里。我们用自己的行为互相伤害，直到有一天终于达到了高潮。

I used her body in one of the worst ways possible. I know she said she has forgiven me but I don't deserve to be forgiven. I still to this day feel sick about it. Then I tried to kill her in Third Impact, I tried to kill everyone. She says that it's what she wanted and what she pushed me to do but I was the one with my finger on the trigger and not her.  
我以一种最糟糕的方式利用了她的身体。我知道她说她已经原谅了我，但我不值得被原谅。直到今天我仍然对此感到恶心。然后我试图在第三次冲击中杀死她，我试图杀死所有人。她说这是她想要的，也是她逼我做的，但扣动扳机的是我，而不是她。

When I returned she looked after me, she nursed me back to health and we finally admitted our feelings. A part of me always wondered what if we could do it again. What could we change but we had our phrase that you can't redo.  
当我回来时，她照顾我，护理我恢复健康，我们终于承认了我们的感受。我的一部分总是想知道如果我们能再做一次会怎样。我们可以改变什么，但我们有句话说你不能重做。

It seems so stupid to me now when I look back on it that I ever thought it was possible. When I woke up in that fantasy world I thought I had a second chance. I questioned none of it. Now I've paid the price. We couldn't stop the end of the world again. I've lost her again.  
现在回想起来，我觉得这太愚蠢了，以至于我以前认为这是可能的。当我在那个幻想世界中醒来时，我以为我有第二次机会。我对这些都没有质疑。现在我已经付出了代价。我们无法再次阻止世界末日。我又失去了她。

I'd cry if it wasn't so damn cold.  
如果不是那么冷的话我会哭。

The little girl called Asuka leads me through the field to a small clearing within which a giant tree sits. Underneath the tree I spot a woman with long red hair like mine, she's reading a book and next to her is a small blanket with a basket place upon it. My mouth goes dry as she turns to look at me. Her eyes are blue, just like mine. They're welcoming, a mothers eyes. My mother's eyes.  
名叫明日香的小女孩带我穿过田野，来到一片小空地，空地里有一棵大树。在树下，我看到一个和我一样有着红色长发的女人，她正在读书，旁边有一条小毯子，上面放着一个篮子。当她转过头来看着我时，我的口干舌燥。她的眼睛是蓝色的，就像我的一样。他们是热情的，就像母亲的眼睛。我妈妈的眼睛。

The little girl lets go of my hand and runs up to her.  
小女孩松开我的手，跑向她。

"I found the person you were looking for Mama!"  
“妈妈，我找到你要找的人了！”

She runs her hands through the girls hair playfully, "So I see, tell you what. Papa is at the lake, why don't you go and see him for a moment. Me and this girl have something to discuss."  
她俏皮地用手梳理着女孩的头发，“我明白了，告诉你吧。爸爸在湖边，你去看看他吧。我和这个女孩有件事要商量。”

"Okay Mama!" “好的，妈妈！”

The little girl skips off in the opposite direction and I stand there with my mouth agape doing my best impression of a fish out of water. It's one of the few times I genuinely have nothing to say. I can't move any of my limbs to walk towards her. This is a trick, I know it's a trick. It's just the Angel using the image of my mother against me. Yet… it feels so real. It feels so real and I just want to run forward into her arms. I want to run into her arms and be held and told everything is going to be alright. I don't want to go back.  
小女孩向相反的方向跳去，我张大嘴巴站在那里，尽我最大的努力想象一条离开水的鱼。这是我真正无话可说的少数几次之一。我无法移动任何四肢向她走去。这是一个诡计，我知道这是一个诡计。这只是天使利用我母亲的形象来对付我。然而……感觉如此真实。感觉如此真实，我只想跑进她的怀里。我想扑进她的怀里，被她抱着，告诉她一切都会好起来的。我不想回去。

Finally the woman turns to look at me, she smiles, "Hello Asuka… it's been a long time hasn't it?"  
最后那个女人转过头来看着我，她微笑着，“你好，明日香……好久不见了，不是吗？”

I slowly nod my head and cautiously take a step forward. I've dreamed of moments like this before. Seeing her again but they always end the same way, by becoming a nightmare.  
我缓缓点了点头，小心翼翼地向前迈出了一步。我以前曾梦想过这样的时刻。再次见到她，但他们总是以同样的方式结束，变成一场噩梦。

"I understand your apprehension."  
“我理解你的担忧。”

"Y-You do?" “你、你知道吗？”

"Yes but you have nothing to be afraid of. You cannot be hurt here, you are safe but… we do have things to discuss. Please sit with me Asuka."  
“是的，但是你没有什么可害怕的。你在这里不会受伤，你很安全，但是……我们确实有事情要讨论。请和我一起坐在明日香身边。”

"Is… is it really you Mama?"  
“妈……真的是你吗？”

I ask the question already knowing the answer. It can't really be her because my mother is dead, she killed herself after her soul was torn apart during the contact experiment. What I'm seeing now is just some sort of illusion or remnant of that. Just like the remnant that exists in my Eva. I have to know how she answers the question.  
我问的问题已经知道答案了。不可能真的是她，因为我母亲已经死了，她在接触实验中灵魂被撕裂后自杀了。我现在所看到的只是某种幻觉或幻象的残余。就像我的伊娃身上存在的残余一样。我必须知道她如何回答这个问题。

"You have no reason to be afraid of her Asuka."  
“你没有理由害怕她的明日香。”

Startled by the new voice I turn around and I'm greeted by the silver hair of Kaworu Nagisa. He's smiling and looking straight at me.  
我被新的声音吓了一跳，回头一看，迎接我的是银发的渚薰。他微笑着直视着我。

"Y-You… what's going on? What is this place?"  
“你、你……这是怎么回事？这是什么地方？”

"This is the product of mine and Reis desire to defeat the Angel and save your world."  
“这是我和雷斯想要击败天使并拯救你们世界的产物。”

"B-But Shinji and I failed… we got pulled into the Angel."  
“但、但是我和真嗣失败了……我们被拉进了天使之中。”

His expression does not change. Of course it doesn't. Kaworu knows more than I do. I'm just along for the ride, "Yes I am aware but you did not fail. The fight is ongoing but it is no longer being fought in the Geofront. The Angels true form has revealed itself to us."  
他的表情没有变化。当然不是。薰知道的比我多。我只是随波逐流，“是的，我知道，但你并没有失败。战斗仍在继续，但不再是在地界前线进行。天使的真实形态已经向我们显现。”

"How?" I ask him. “如何？”我问他。

"The forbidden fusion of Adam and Lilith." My mother speaks.  
“亚当与莉莉丝的禁忌融合。”我妈妈说话了。

I spin around again at the sound of my mother's voice. She knows about Lilith? Of course she does, she worked for Gehirn and helped develop the Eva's she'll probably know as much as Shinji's mother did.  
听到妈妈的声音，我又转了一圈。她知道莉莉丝的事吗？她当然知道，她为 Gehirn 工作并帮助开发了 Eva，她可能会像真嗣的母亲一样了解。

"You've used Lilith's power to freeze the Geofront in place haven't you? Trapping the Angel and those within and preventing it from affecting the outside world. Yet there is more to this Angel then you anticipated. Of course that is to be expected from a man-made Angel. That's why this place exists, am I right?"  
“你已经用莉莉丝的力量将地锋冻结了不是吗？困住天使和里面的人，防止其影响外界。然而，这个天使的事情比你想象的要多。当然，这是要的。”这是人造天使所期待的，这就是这个地方存在的原因，对吗？”

I turn back around to Kaworu who simply nods, "That is correct. Our hope was to freeze the Angel in place within the Geofront. In truth we were unaware of its true nature, Angels are unique in their design and this one more so because of the influence of the Lilin. It has been revealed to us that the Angel within the Geofront is only one component of this Angel. As for this place, it was not my will that conjured this place. This place is a sanctuary conjured not by our will but yours Asuka."  
我转身对着 Kaworu，他只是点点头，“没错。我们的希望是将天使冻结在 Geofront 内。事实上，我们并没有意识到它的真正本质，天使的设计是独一无二的，而这个更是如此，因为已经向我们透露，地阵中的天使只是这个天使的一个组成部分，而这个地方并不是我的意志召唤出来的，这个地方不是由我召唤出来的。我们的意志，但你的明日香。”

I look back in shock, "I-I did this?"  
我震惊地回头，“我、我竟然这么做了？”

"Yes, it is a safe space but you cannot remain here forever. The Angel will eventually breach it."  
“是的，这是一个安全的空间，但你不能永远留在这里。天使最终会突破它。”

I don't understand any of this. I may as well put that phrase on a T-Shirt for all the times I've used it lately. I'm responsible for this place but the Angel can still breach it. We still have a chance to beat the Angel but no one is telling me how.  
我不明白这些。我不妨把这句话写在 T 恤上，因为我最近一直在使用它。我负责这个地方，但天使仍然可以突破它。我们仍然有机会击败天使，但没有人告诉我如何击败。

"I-I don't know what to do…"  
“我、我不知道该怎么办……”

"Sit with me Asuka." “和我一起坐到明日香那里吧。”

I feel my body seem to move of its own volition towards her and I sit myself down on the blanket in front of the woman. I sense Kaworu walking away from us. As I get closer to the woman my heart begins to beat faster and faster. I'm expecting everything to still change in a second. To see her vanish, the sky to change to black and the tree to be burnt down. As I sit down none of that happens. Instead she pours me a cup of tea and hands it to me.  
我感觉我的身体似乎不由自主地向她移动，我在女人面前的毯子上坐下。我感觉到薰正在离我们远去。当我离那个女人越来越近时，我的心跳得越来越快。我期待一切都会在一秒钟内改变。看着她消失，天变黑，树被烧毁。当我坐下来时，这一切都没有发生。相反，她给我倒了一杯茶，递给我。

"You've grown a lot Asuka."  
“明日香，你长大了很多。”

"Yeah." “是的。”

"Do you know where this is?"  
“你知道这是哪里吗？”

I shake my head at her, "No."  
我对她摇摇头：“没有。”

"This is a place in Germany, near where we used to live. A couple of miles out of the city. Away from Gehirn, away from SEELE and away from the Eva's. We used to come here for weekends, just me you and your father. It was so nice and peaceful. You used to play in the fields of sunflowers while your father would relax fishing on the lakeside. You don't remember it at all thought do you?"  
“这是德国的一个地方，离我们以前住的地方很近。离城几英里。远离Gehirn，远离SEELE，远离Eva。我们过去常来这里度周末，只有我、你和你的孩子。”爸爸，你曾经在向日葵田里玩耍，而你的爸爸却在湖边放松地钓鱼，你想吗？”

My gaze lowered out of embarrassment, "No… I don't. Sorry."  
我尴尬地垂下目光，“不……我不。抱歉。”

She laughs, "You sound like Shinji."  
她笑道：“你听起来像真嗣。”

"Huh? You know Shinji?" “嗯？你认识真嗣？”

"Of course I know Shinji. I knew him before you did. Yui Ikari's son and of course you've told me about him."  
“我当然认识真嗣。我比你早认识他。碇结衣的儿子，当然你也跟我说过他的事。”

"I-I did?" “我、我做到了？”

"Yes, stupid Shinji. Invincible Shinji and a few other things a mother shouldn't hear from her daughter."  
“是的，愚蠢的真嗣。无敌的真嗣，还有一些母亲不应该从女儿嘴里听到的事情。”

"O-Oh… I'm sorry." “哦，哦……对不起。”

"It's fine. You didn't know it was me in there until recently. You weren't ever supposed to know I was in there. All of what happened was never supposed to happen. We… me and Yui were supposed to save the world. Not condemn it but… that man… he ruined everything…"  
“没关系。直到最近你才知道我在那里。你不应该知道我在那里。发生的所有事情都不应该发生。我们……我和结衣应该拯救不是谴责它，而是……那个人……他毁了一切……”

"That man?" “那个人？”

I wonder who she means but then I realize who it must be. The one man who went against SEELE all for his own desire. Shinji's father.  
我想知道她指的是谁，但后来我意识到那一定是谁。一个为了一己私欲而与SEELE作对的人。慎二的父亲。

"You mean Shinji's father right?"  
“你是说真嗣的父亲吧？”

"Yes, me and Yui… we made a mistake. We both agreed to not tell our husbands what was going to happen to us. We thought…"  
“是的，我和唯……我们犯了一个错误。我们都同意不告诉我们的丈夫我们将要发生什么。我们以为……”

She pauses for a moment and bites her bottom lip nervously, "We made a mistake Asuka and had to watch while our children suffered."  
她停顿了一下，紧张地咬着下唇，“我们明日香犯了一个错误，不得不眼睁睁地看着我们的孩子受苦。”

I reach out a hand and place it on her shoulder, "Its fine… we… we did fix things and we will."  
我伸出一只手放在她的肩膀上，“没关系……我们……我们确实解决了问题，我们会的。”

Her hand reaches up towards mine and takes it off of her shoulder. She holds it gently and I feel warmth spread throughout my body. I almost feel like I could burst into tears, my mother is holding my hand.  
她的手伸向我的手，把它从她的肩膀上拿下来。她轻轻地握住它，我感到温暖传遍全身。我几乎感觉自己要哭出来了，妈妈握着我的手。

"I know Asuka, that's why I'm here now."  
“我认识明日香，所以我现在才来这里。”

---

My feet are starting to grow cold from walking in this snow. I don't know how long I've been walking for but I need somewhere to go and soon otherwise I'm going to freeze. My stomach growls at me and I sneeze. I really need to find somewhere. I keep moving forward down another street. All of these streets are unrecognizable to me, I don't know where I am or what I'm doing here. I can't ask anyone for help, the few people I have passed looked at me like I'm some sort of alien.  
在雪地里行走，我的脚开始变冷。我不知道我走了多久，但我需要有个地方可以去，否则我会冻僵的。我的肚子向我咆哮，我打了个喷嚏。我真的需要找个地方。我继续沿着另一条街向前走。所有这些街道我都认不出来了，我不知道我在哪里，也不知道我在这里做什么。我不能向任何人寻求帮助，我经过的几个人看着我，就像我是某种外星人一样。

I come up to a sheltered shopfront and decide to pause for a moment in the entrance way just to get me out of the wind. Why am I here? Is it to just wander endlessly until I eventually freeze to death?  
我来到一家有遮蔽的店面，决定在入口处停下来避风。为什么我在这里？难道就这样无休无止地徘徊，直到最终冻死吗？

I look ahead of me and see nothing but more streets. I see headlights from cars and shadows moving back and forth. I don't see anywhere to go. I'm alone in this place.  
我向前看去，除了更多的街道之外什么也看不见。我看到汽车的前灯和来回移动的阴影。我看不出有什么地方可去。我独自一人在这个地方。

"Asuka… where are you?" “明日香……你在哪里？”

"Excuse me?" “打扰一下？”

I jump at the voice and turn around. I'm startled as I find myself looking straight into the eyes of Rei. She's wearing a full coat, gloves and scarf but the red eyes, the blue hair is all there. I look down and see her holding another neatly folded jacket in her arms.  
我听到声音就跳了起来，然后转过身来。当我发现自己直视丽的眼睛时，我吃了一惊。她穿着全套外套、手套和围巾，但红色的眼睛、蓝色的头发都在那里。我低下头，看到她怀里还抱着另一件叠得整整齐齐的夹克。

"R-Rei? Is… that really you?"  
“R-Rei？真的是你吗？”

"Put this on and follow me."  
“穿上这个，跟我来。”

"Rei what's going on?" “瑞伊怎么了？”

In her typical fashion she says nothing and immediately begins to walk away. I hurriedly put on the jacket she handed me and go to catch her up. There is so much I want to say to her, and ask her. She was the one who told me about the Angel, told me about the false world I was in. So she must know what is happening right now. Yet I can't bring myself to say anything. It's just like the time I took her ID card to her.  
她以她典型的方式什么也没说，然后立即走开。我赶紧穿上她递给我的外套，去追她。我有很多话想对她说，想问她。她是那个告诉我关于天使的人，告诉我关于我所处的虚假世界的人。所以她一定知道现在正在发生什么。但我却无法让自己说什么。就像我把她的身份证拿给她的时候一样。

So instead we continue to walk in silence to the unknown destination. We cross over a road and eventually after a short walk enter an empty street. She walks up to a house someway into the street and takes us around into the back garden. From there she opens the door into a brightly lit kitchen.  
于是我们继续默默地走向未知的目的地。我们穿过一条马路，走了一小段路后，最终进入了一条空荡荡的街道。她走到街上某处的一栋房子前，带我们绕到后花园。从那里她打开门，进入一间灯火通明的厨房。

I don't know where we are but I'm at least thankful for the sudden burst of warmth I feel as I enter. I remove the jacket and timidly enter the kitchen and look around. It's quite spacious, a table is set out in the middle.  
我不知道我们在哪里，但至少我很感激当我进入时突然感受到的温暖。我脱下外套，胆怯地走进厨房，环顾四周。里面挺宽敞的，中间放了一张桌子。

"You should change. Upstairs in the first room on the left is a change of clothes."  
“你该换衣服了，楼上左边第一个房间有换洗的衣服。”

"Wait… w-where am I? T-This isn't… what happened to me Rei?"  
“等等……我、我这是在哪儿？这、这不是……我怎么了，丽？”

"I will explain when you return."  
“等你回来我会解释的。”

I sneeze and she continues, "You should get out of your Plugsuit"  
我打了个喷嚏，她继续说道，“你应该脱掉你的插头服”

I nod and leave the kitchen to find the change of clothes she mentioned. I walk along the hallway and the first thing I notice is the house is fairly empty. It has what is necessary to live but there is nothing in the way of decorations. No photos, no ornaments, no nothing. I walk upstairs and enter the room and remove my Plugsuit.  
我点点头，离开厨房去寻找她提到的换洗衣服。我沿着走廊走，我注意到的第一件事是房子相当空。它有生活必需的东西，但没有任何装饰。没有照片，没有装饰品，什么都没有。我走上楼，进入房间，脱下我的插头套装。

As I remove the suit I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror. My cheeks and nose are red from being out in the cold. My hair is messy and on my forward is a closed wound which is the one I got from the battle against the Eva series. I also look skinnier than I did some time ago. I guess when I returned from that other place I was put back into my body that had been in a coma.  
当我脱下套装时，我在镜子里瞥见了自己。由于寒冷，我的脸颊和鼻子都红了。我的头发很乱，前面有一个闭合的伤口，这是我在与伊娃系列的战斗中得到的伤口。我看起来也比前段时间瘦了。我想当我从另一个地方回来时，我又回到了昏迷的身体里。

Across it are bruises and little scars from my various fights in the past. I shake my head and put on the clothes that have been put out for me. A white shirt, black trousers and clean underwear. Finally I head back down into the kitchen just in time to see Rei pouring something into the bowl.  
上面有我过去多次打架留下的瘀伤和小疤痕。我摇摇头，穿上了给我准备的衣服。白衬衫、黑裤子和干净的内衣。最后，我回到厨房，正好看到丽正在往碗里倒东西。

I smile when I see its soup, similar to the one I made for Rei in that other world. Without needing to be told I sit down in front of the bowl and gently rest my hands around it to warm them up. I'm not especially hungry. In fact all of my thoughts are pre-occupied by Asuka and where she is right now but I'm thankful for this.  
当我看到它的汤时我微笑了，就像我在另一个世界为丽做的汤一样。不需要别人告诉我，我就坐在碗前，轻轻地把手放在碗上，让它们暖和起来。我不是特别饿。事实上，我所有的心思都集中在明日香和她现在的位置上，但我对此表示感谢。

"Thank you Rei." “谢谢你雷。”

She sits near to me and watches as I dip my spoon into the soup and bring it to my lips. It's still hot so I blow on it gently before taking some of it into my mouth. As I lower the spoon I see she is still looking at me. There is something in her eyes I don't recognize, its eagerness. She's waiting for my reaction.  
她坐在我旁边，看着我把勺子浸入汤中，然后送到唇边。它仍然很热，所以我轻轻地吹了吹，然后将一些放入嘴里。当我放下勺子时，我发现她仍在看着我。她的眼里有一种我不认识的东西，那就是渴望。她在等我的反应。

"I-It's really good. Thank you."  
“我、真的很好。谢谢你。”

"I am glad." “我很高兴。”

I keep on taking in the soup and feel the warmth return to my body. We sit in a comfortable silence, she is no longer watching me seemingly satisfied that I liked what she prepared for me. I don't understand how she knew where I would be though. I don't understand where I am.  
我继续喝着汤，感觉温暖又回到了我的身体。我们坐在舒适的沉默中，她不再看着我，似乎对我喜欢她为我准备的东西感到满意。我不明白她怎么知道我会在哪里。我不明白我在哪里。

"Rei…" “丽……”

"You are safe." “你安全了。”

I nearly stand up in shock, "Safe? But where exactly am I?"  
我震惊得差点站起来，“安全了？可我到底在哪儿？”

She nods, "Away from the Geofront, from Tokyo-3. I believe this is a town was used by NERV before the Third Impact."  
她点点头，“远离 Geofront，来自第三东京。我相信这是 NERV 在第三次冲击之前使用的城镇。”

"Wh-What? I don't understand! How? I…"  
“什、什么？我不明白！怎么？我……”

"What do you remember last?"  
“你最后记得什么？”

I look around the room, it explains why I didn't recognize where I was and why everything seemed so unnatural to me here.  
我环顾房间，这解释了为什么我不知道自己在哪里，为什么这里的一切对我来说都那么不自然。

"I-I was in the Entry Plug with Asuka, we had been pulled into the Angel. There was a bright light and I found myself here."  
“我、我和明日香一起在入口插头里，我们被拉进了天使。有一道明亮的光，我发现自己在这里。”

"I see." “我懂了。”

I look around the room, "W-What are you doing here? Why… I thought, you and Kaworu were…"  
我环视房间，“你、你在这里做什么？为什么……我以为，你和薰……”

She offers no reply but instead stands up and switches on a small television in the corner. On the screen I see a scene I recognise straight away, it's an aerial shot of the Geofront but there is a giant dome of light covering it.  
她没有回答，而是站起来，打开了角落里的一台小电视。在屏幕上，我看到一个我立即认出的场景，这是 Geofront 的空中拍摄，但有一个巨大的光穹覆盖它。

"An emergency situation is currently developing in the former city of Tokyo-3. We have been told that the U.N. is monitoring the situation closely and that any rumours of an Impact level event are to be treated as a rumour for the time being."  
“前第三东京市目前正在发生紧急情况。我们被告知，联合国正在密切监视局势，任何有关影响级别事件的谣言暂时都将被视为谣言。”

"No further information has been made available thus far by the Japanese Government or the UN relating to the dome of light covering the area but officials have warned members of the public within a thirty mile radius to evacuate. We will bring you more as we get it."  
“到目前为止，日本政府或联合国尚未提供有关覆盖该地区的光穹的更多信息，但官员已警告半径三十英里内的公众撤离。我们将在收到更多信息后为您提供更多信息。”它。”

I look towards the TV as the image of the dome of light fades to a man talking about some the weather. It's real… this is the real world but I don't know where I am. I know from watching the news we're still in Japan. I'm not at the Geofront. I was brought here for some reason.  
我看向电视，光穹的图像逐渐消失，变成了一个正在谈论天气的男人。这是真实的……这是真实的世界，但我不知道自己在哪里。我从新闻中知道我们还在日本。我不在 Geofront。我因为某种原因被带到这里。

"Misato… she's there isn't she?"  
“美里……她在那儿不是吗？”

"I do not know, all I know is what they have shared with me and what is on this screen."  
“我不知道，我只知道他们与我分享的内容以及屏幕上的内容。”

I bow my head and stare into the bowl. I'm more than useless here, it isn't like before where I had a choice. I'm half a world away and I can do nothing but observe. I look at Rei and I wonder how long she has been here and how she got here. Does she have any connection to this place, did my father?  
我低下头，盯着碗里。我在这里简直一无是处，不再像以前那样有选择的余地了。我在半个地球之外，除了观察之外什么也做不了。我看着丽，想知道她在这里呆了多久以及她是如何来到这里的。她和这个地方有什么联系吗，我的父亲吗？

"Rei, why are you… what is this place?"  
“丽，你为什么……这是什么地方？”

"This is the home of my guardian here. I was found on a beach nearby. I had… forgotten most of who I was. I was found and taken in.  
“这是我监护人的家。我在附近的海滩上被发现。我……忘记了我是谁。我被发现并被收留。

"Y-Your guardian?" 「你、你的监护人？」

All of this information is passing through me so quickly that it's hard to make sense of it. I'm fighting a war on all fronts in my mind. I have to know more about Rei but I also keep on wandering back to Asuka and what is happening to her. I decide that Rei's story can wait.  
所有这些信息都如此之快地从我的脑海中闪过，以至于我很难理解它们。我心里正在各条战线上打一场仗。我必须更多地了解丽，但我也不断地回到明日香以及她身上发生了什么事。我决定丽的故事可以等等。

"Rei… where is Asuka?" “丽……明日香在哪里？”

Rei's head drops, "She is… she is fighting the Angel."  
雷低下头，“她……她正在与天使战斗。”

---

As I sit here eating a sandwich from this basket and sipping at tea I can't help but feel like a traitor. What am I doing here while the world is going to hell, why am I just allowing myself to linger here? I look across to my mother and she says nothing for a moment. Then, almost as if she can read my thoughts she speaks.  
当我坐在这里，吃着篮子里的三明治，喝着茶时，我不禁觉得自己像个叛徒。当世界正在走向地狱时，我在这里做什么，为什么我要让自己留在这里？我望向母亲，她一时什么也没说。然后，她就好像能读懂我的想法一样说话了。

"You will have to leave this place soon I am afraid. Eventually it will collapse and the fight will resume."  
“恐怕你很快就得离开这个地方了。最终它会崩溃，战斗将会重新开始。”

Bowing my head I nod, "Yeah… nothing good lasts long for me."  
我低下头，点点头：“是啊……没有什么好事对我来说是长久的。”

"Don't be an idiot Asuka."  
“明日香，别做个白痴。”

I look up at the sudden change in her tone, she's glaring at me. Her eyes, her tone and what she said. I can't help but burst out laughing.  
我抬头看着她语气突然的变化，她正瞪着我。她的眼神，她的语气，还有她说的话。我忍不住笑了起来。

"What's so funny?" “有什么好笑的？”

Through laughter I look up to her, "Just… what you said… it's… I'm really your daughter aren't I?"  
我笑着抬头看向她，“只是……你说的……是……我真的是你的女儿不是吗？”

She looks like she's about to snap back at me for a moment before smiling.  
她看起来像是要对我大吼大叫，然后微笑起来。

"Yes… yes you are, but you're also a small part your fathers daughter too. I suppose that's the idiot part of you."  
“是的……是的，你是，但你也是你父亲女儿的一小部分。我想这就是你的白痴部分。”

"Hah, if you think I'm bad you should meet Shinji."  
“哈，如果你觉得我不好，你就去见见真嗣吧。”

"I would have really liked to, he must be quite something…"  
“我真的很想这么做，他一定很了不起……”

I nod, "Yeah, he's an idiot and annoying but he's… a lot of good things as well."  
我点点头，“是的，他是个白痴，而且很烦人，但他……也有很多好东西。”

I feel her hand reach for mine and hold it gently.  
我感觉到她的手伸向我的，轻轻握住。

"Asuka… I knew what I was doing when I got into the Eva that day. I knew what I would miss out on but if I had known what was going to happen I… I wouldn't have done it. I would have tried to find some other way."  
“明日香……那天我进入伊娃号时，我知道自己在做什么。我知道我会错过什么，但如果我知道会发生什么，我……我就不会这样做。我会尝试的寻找其他方法。”

I look up at her, her eyes have tears in them but she's not allowing herself to cry. I guess I do take after her in ways. I take my other hand and put it over hers. "It's okay. You had to do it didn't you? If you hadn't Shinji would have had to fight alone and we probably wouldn't have beaten all of the Angels."  
我抬头看着她，她的眼睛里含着泪水，但她不允许自己哭。我想我确实在某种程度上模仿了她。我把另一只手放在她的手上。 「没关系。你必须这么做不是吗？如果你不这么做，真嗣就只能孤军奋战，我们可能就无法打败所有天使了。」

She laughs but then the tone turns serious. She knows my mind keeps on wandering back to that other place, to the world outside of this where the Angel threatens what we have. It's as she said I will have to leave this place soon. It's inevitable.  
她笑了，但随后语气变得严肃。她知道我的思绪不断地回到那个地方，回到这个之外的世界，在那里天使威胁着我们所拥有的一切。正如她所说，我很快就要离开这个地方了。这是不可避免的。

"I don't know what to do next Mama, I always just used to know how to fight but that was physical and that was conventional. I used to be able to fight like that… what the Angels can do… its worse than any pain I've ever felt."  
“我不知道下一步该做什么，妈妈，我以前总是只知道如何战斗，但那是身体上的，而且是传统的。我曾经能够像那样战斗......天使能做什么......它比任何人都糟糕我从未感受过的痛苦。”

"I know it is, I was there alongside you for every step of it. I was there to feel your pain. Everything you felt I felt."  
“我知道，每一步我都在你身边。我在那里感受你的痛苦。你感受到的一切我也感受到了。”

"Y-You really were watching over me weren't you?"  
「你、你真的一直在监视我不是吗？」

"I tried so hard to protect you Asuka. I just… I couldn't. Even the Evangelion's have limits and without an S2 Engine and against the Lance we found ours."  
“我非常努力地保护你，明日香。我只是……我做不到。即使是新世纪福音战士也有局限性，在没有 S2 引擎的情况下，我们找到了我们的极限。”

I shudder at the memory of that day for a number of reasons. I never realized she would have felt all of that pain as well. If I had known that was her in there I would have done things so differently. I treated the Eva like some childs plaything not realizing the full power it had. I was even told as much by Rei and Shinji but I didn't listen.  
由于多种原因，我对那天的记忆感到不寒而栗。我从来没有意识到她也会感受到所有的痛苦。如果我知道那是她的话，我会采取不同的做法。我对待伊娃就像对待一些孩子的玩具一样，没有意识到它拥有全部的力量。丽和真嗣也这么告诉过我，但我没有听。

We laugh for a moment but then she turns serious again, "Do you really believe that Asuka? About nothing good lasting for you?"  
我们笑了一会儿，但随后她又变得严肃起来，“你真的相信明日香吗？没有什么对你来说是永恒的？”

I don't know how to answer that. A part of me does genuinely believe it and why shouldn't I? Whatever happiness I've found in my life has only ever been temporary. The only happiness I ever found had soul crushing pain at the end of it. So maybe I do believe that.  
我不知道该怎么回答。我的一部分确实相信这一点，为什么我不应该呢？无论我在生活中找到什么幸福，都只是暂时的。我所找到的唯一幸福，最后却是令人心碎的痛苦。所以也许我确实相信这一点。

If I did though would I really still be here and trying to reach for happiness? I had the chance to get rid of it all once but I didn't take it, I wanted to fight and seize my chance to happiness. To no longer run away from who I was or hate myself.  
如果我这样做了，我真的还会在这里并努力追求幸福吗？我曾经有一次机会摆脱这一切，但我没有抓住，我想奋斗并抓住获得幸福的机会。不再逃避自己或讨厌自己。

I finally shake my head, "No… I don't but… I don't think me finding happiness will be that easy either."  
我最终摇了摇头，“不……我不知道，但是……我想我也不会那么容易找到幸福。”

"That's correct, it won't be. For you or for Shinji, you will both have to fight for it just as you have been doing but you can find it. There will be moments where it'll feel like it's impossible. There will be days where you feel like you're constantly under a dark cloud but if you both support one another you'll both get through it."  
“是的，但不会。对于你或真嗣来说，你们都必须像以前一样为之奋斗，但你可以找到它。有时候会感觉这是不可能的。有这几天你会感觉自己一直处于乌云之下，但如果你们互相支持，你们都会渡过难关。”

"I know… but..." “我知道但是...”

I bite my bottom lip before admitting it, "I'm scared Mama. Of who I was and who I might be. You know what I did during Third Impact and what I'm capable of. I nearly ended the world. I… what if I hurt him? What if I hurt myself?"  
我咬着下唇承认道：“妈妈，我很害怕。我是谁，我可能是谁。你知道我在第三次冲击期间做了什么，我能做什么。我差点就终结了世界。我……如果我伤害了他怎么办？”

"There is no answer to that Asuka. I can tell you to stop blaming yourself for what happened just as you once told him and just as others will tell both of you but there is no honest answer."  
“对于那个明日香，没有答案。我可以告诉你，不要再为所发生的事情而自责，就像你曾经告诉他的那样，就像其他人会告诉你们俩的那样，但没有诚实的答案。”

I let out a sigh and look back across the path I came from. In the distance I can see ominous looking storm clouds developing. I turn and look back at my mother. I have a feeling our time left is running short.  
我叹了口气，回头看了一眼来时的路。在远处，我可以看到不祥的暴风云正在形成。我转身回头看着妈妈。我有一种感觉，我们剩下的时间不多了。

"Mama I…" “妈妈我……”

"Listen to me Asuka. This isn't going to be easy, it will hurt and you will feel pain but you have to stay strong. You have to be that Evangelion pilot just one more time for me. I'll be watching over you. I love you."  
“听我说，明日香。这并不容易，它会受伤，你会感到痛苦，但你必须保持坚强。你必须为我再做一次新世纪福音战士飞行员。我会看着的我爱你。

I want to say it back but the words get stuck in my throat so instead I rush forward and wrap my arms around her and bury my head into her shoulder. I feel her embrace around me and I ignore the distant rumble of thunder as she holds me to her. Eventually I'm able to whisper.  
我想反驳，但话哽在喉咙里，所以我冲上前去，用双臂搂住她，把头埋进她的肩膀。我感觉到她拥抱着我，当她把我抱在怀里时，我忽略了远处传来的隆隆雷声。终于我可以轻声说话了。

"I love you too." “我也爱你。”

Slowly she lets go of me and she gets to her feet. There is a presence behind me and I turn to see Kaworu watching us with a curious expression on his face.  
慢慢地，她放开了我，站了起来。我身后有一个人，我转过头看到薰带着好奇的表情看着我们。

"You're crying." “你哭了。”

I wipe the tear from my cheek and snap back at him, "Shut it Angel boy. It's time we killed this thing."  
我擦掉脸颊上的泪水，对他厉声说道：“闭嘴，天使男孩。我们是时候杀了这个东西了。”

His constant smile finally changes to a grin, "So you're ready?"  
他的笑容终于变成了笑容：“那你准备好了吗？”

I nod, "Are you stupid? Of course I am."  
我点头：“你傻吗？我当然傻。”

Light engulfs me and I turn around one last time to see her standing there watching me. She raises her hand to wave me good bye. I raise my own hand and smile but the smile soon fades as I see the thunder close in. Suddenly there is a great crash and flash of lighting. I watch as an object comes hurtling through the fields and stops just in front of my mother.  
光芒吞没了我，我最后一次转过身，看到她站在那里看着我。她举起手向我挥手告别。我举起手微笑，但当我看到雷声逼近时，笑容很快就消失了。突然，一声巨响和一道闪电。我看到一个物体疾驰穿过田野，停在我母亲面前。

I yell for her to get out of the way but it's too late. I try to dash forward but I feel a strong pair of arms hold me back. I thrash wildly watching the lance piece through my mother's back just as the light completely engulfs me and I'm thrown back into darkness.  
我大喊让她让开，但为时已晚。我试图向前冲去，但我感觉一双有力的手臂阻止了我。我疯狂地看着长矛穿过母亲的背，光芒完全吞没了我，我又被扔回黑暗中。

Rei has just come off the phone to someone. I assume it was the man she called her guardian earlier. The telephone was in the other room and I thought it better than to intrude on what might have been a private conversation. I still have so many questions as to what to do next. What is happening to Asuka? How do I get back to her? What am I supposed to do now?  
雷刚刚给某人通完电话。我猜想这个人就是她之前称呼她为监护人的那个人。电话在另一个房间，我认为这比打扰本来可能是私人谈话的事情要好。我仍然有很多问题不知道下一步该怎么做。明日香怎么了？我怎样才能回到她身边？我现在该怎么办？

"My guardian has informed me he won't be able to make it home tonight. The blizzard has completely snowed them in at the place he is at."  
“我的监护人告诉我，他今晚无法回家。暴风雪已经把他们完全困在了他所在的地方。”

"I… I see, where is he?"  
“我……我明白了，他在哪儿？”

"He is visiting his brother. His brother is a member of NERVs security team."  
“他正在探望他的兄弟。他的兄弟是 NERV 安全团队的成员。”

"Oh… wait, he's associated with NERV?"  
“哦……等等，他和NERV有关系？”

Rei nods, "Yes. That is the reason I am staying with this man. It was his brother who discovered me when I emerged here and he recognized who I was. He took me in and brought me here claiming it would be safe for me."  
雷点点头，“是的。这就是我和这个男人住在一起的原因。当我出现在这里时，是他的兄弟发现了我，他认出了我是谁。他收留了我，并把我带到了这里，声称这对我来说是安全的”。

"I see. So… he'll know who I am and… he might know about Misato and what's happening."  
“我明白了。所以……他会知道我是谁，而且……他可能会知道美里的事以及正在发生的事情。”

"It is possible but I have been told by him that I am not to mention anything to do with NERV for the time being."  
“有可能，但他告诉我，暂时不要提任何与NERV有关的事情。”

"Why?" “为什么？”

"I did not question him."  
“我没有质问他。”

Of course she didn't. Rei wouldn't question something like that, me and Asuka might have done. Asuka definitely would have done. I might have asked one question and left it at that. I sigh and look out of the window. The snow has gotten worse outside, I look across at Rei who seems to be quite taken by the snow as well.  
她当然没有。丽不会质疑这样的事情，我和明日香可能会质疑。明日香肯定会这么做。我可能只问了一个问题，然后就不再问了。我叹了口气，看着窗外。外面的雪下得更大了，我看着对面的丽，她似乎也被雪迷住了。

"This snow isn't natural is it?"  
“这雪不是天然的吧？”

"I do not know." “我不知道。”

"It was snowing in the Geofront when we started to fight the Angel."  
“当我们开始与天使战斗时，地缘正在下雪。”

"I know." “我知道。”

"Of course you do… so there are… two of you in the world right now? Does that mean Kaworu is out there somewhere too?"  
“当然……所以现在世界上有……你们两个人？这是否意味着薰也在外面的某个地方？”

"I do not know, I no longer share the same bonds I had with people that I used to. I was aware of the other Ayanami's presence but that has now ceased to be when the light engulfed the Geofront. If there is another Kaworu Nagisa out there I am not aware of him."  
“我不知道，我和以前的人不再有同样的联系。我知道另一个绫波的存在，但现在当光芒吞没了地前线时，这种感觉就不再存在了。如果有另一个渚薰的话在外面我不认识他。”

I take in her words and I wonder, not for the first time just who or what Rei Ayanami is. Who is this Rei Ayanami sitting in front of me? Who was the Rei Ayanami who spoke to me before I fought the Angel? Who was the Rei Ayanami who merged itself with Lilith? I know she was technically a clone of my mother and that the one I met when I arrived in Tokyo-3 was the second one. I know that she died and was replaced by another clone. She is beyond my understanding.  
我听了她的话，我不是第一次想知道绫波丽是谁或是什么。坐在我面前的绫波丽是谁？在我与天使战斗之前对我说话的绫波丽是谁？与莉莉丝融合的绫波丽是谁？我知道她严格来说是我母亲的克隆体，而我到达第三东京时遇到的就是第二个。我知道她死了，并被另一个克隆人取代。她超出了我的理解范围。

I smirk at that thought, if Asuka was here she'd probably make a comment that a lot of things are beyond my understanding. She'd probably tell me does it matter what Rei is or who cares. I suppose I shouldn't care what Rei is. Whether she is still a part of Lilith or her own person I'll just settle for her being my friend and one of the closest things I have to family.  
我想到这里就傻笑了，如果明日香在这里的话，她可能会说很多事情是我无法理解的。她可能会告诉我丽是什么或谁在乎这重要吗？我想我不应该关心Rei是什么。无论她仍然是莉莉丝的一部分还是她自己的一部分，我都会满足于她是我的朋友，也是我最亲近的家人之一。

"Do… Do you think Asuka will beat the Angel?"  
“你……你认为明日香会打败天使吗？”

"Yes." “是的。”

The light finally subsides and I'm down on my knees in what looks like a hospital corridor. I retch and throw up what little there is in my stomach. My stomach twists in pain and tears burn in my eyes as I scramble away from the mess I've made on the floor someway down this corridor. I knew I wouldn't see her again after this. I had even prepared myself for it but… but not like that. Why did she have to be taken away from me like that?  
天色终于暗下来，我跪在医院走廊里。我干呕并吐出胃里仅有的一点东西。当我沿着走廊从地板上弄得乱七八糟的地方爬起来时，我的胃在疼痛中扭曲，泪水在我的眼睛里燃烧。我知道此后我再也见不到她了。我什至已经做好了准备，但是……但不是那样的。为什么她就这样被从我身边带走？

The image of the lance piercing through her flashes through my head again as I tilt my head back. One second she was there standing and smiling at me. The next I heard the thunder, I saw the lighting. Her expression didn't change until the last second. She didn't even see it. I saw it though and I could do nothing to stop it. All I could do was watch while being held back as it pierced through her chest, her face contorting in pain and blood spilling out onto the blanket.  
当我向后仰起头时，长矛刺穿她的画面再次闪过我的脑海。前一秒她还站在那里对我微笑。接下来我听到了雷声，我看到了闪电。直到最后一秒，她的表情都没有变化。她甚至没有看到。虽然我看到了，但我无能为力阻止它。我所能做的就是看着它刺穿她的胸口，她的脸因疼痛而扭曲，鲜血溢出到毯子上。

I knew I wasn't going to see her again but I thought I had control of it. I thought it was going to be a bittersweet goodbye, not one that'd leave me feeling like this. I've seen her die three times now. The first was when I was four, the second was in the Eva and the third was just now. I hate this. I hate that I could do nothing about it. I hate the Eva's and I hate the fucking Angels. I hate everything. I just want it all to go away so I don't have to end up feeling like this anymore.  
我知道我不会再见到她了，但我想我可以控制这一切。我以为这将是一次苦乐参半的告别，而不是让我有这样的感觉。我已经见过她死三次了。第一次是我四岁的时候，第二次是在伊娃号里，第三次是现在。我讨厌这个。我恨我对此无能为力。我讨厌伊娃，也讨厌他妈的天使。我讨厌一切。我只是希望这一切都消失，这样我就不必再有这样的感觉了。

I just want to be alone.  
我只想一个人呆着。

### Chapter 25 Grand Finale Infinite Embrace
it. They thought that by the time they had gotten Misato and Shinji to their base that I would have brought them the release they wanted. Except I didn't and they weren't prepared for an assault. A number escaped to god knows where, others died and some were captures. They say the world is in a delicate state right now. Evangelion and Angel based technology is showing up on black markets and being offered to governments. World leaders are at each other's throats every day and the UN don't have enough answers to placate them.  
我们也知道丽贝卡的人并不傻。美里一被叫走，他们就知道出事了，并派了一个小队与联合国联系以追踪航班。同情SEELE的团体万万没想到。他们认为，当他们把美里和真嗣带到他们的基地时，我就会给他们带来他们想要的释放。但我没有这么做，而且他们也没有做好攻击的准备。一些人逃到了天知道在哪里，其他人死亡，还有一些被俘。他们说，世界现在正处于一个微妙的状态。基于《新世纪福音战士》和《天使》的技术正在黑市上出现并被提供给政府。世界领导人每天都在争吵，而联合国却没有足够的答案来安抚他们。

There is talk of constructing the Eva's again. A few still exist in the world from what I know and who knows what secrets are left behind but for now I'm content to just be me.  
有传言称要再次建造伊娃号。据我所知，世界上仍然存在一些人，谁知道留下了什么秘密，但现在我满足于做我自己。

I bring my sunglasses back down over my eyes and lie back as I do Shinji rolls over and positions himself on top of me. I tilt my head at him.  
我把墨镜放回遮住眼睛的位置，然后躺下，而真嗣则翻了个身，压在我身上。我向他歪着头。

"Shinji… what are you doing?"  
“真嗣……你在做什么？”

He blushes, "I…" 他脸红了，“我……”

He's staring at me, looking down at me from the top of my head down to my stomach and I know as soon as I see his face change what he is doing. He's comparing. He's remembering what happened when we returned. Slowly I reach my hand up to him and I gently caress his cheek as he leans in towards me. I see his lip tremble and his eyes water.  
他盯着我，从头顶一直俯视到我的腹部，当我看到他的脸色发生变化时，我就知道他在做什么。他在比较。他还记得我们回来时发生的事情。慢慢地，我把手伸向他，当他靠向我时，我轻轻地抚摸他的脸颊。我看到他的嘴唇在颤抖，他的眼睛流着泪。

"A-Asuka…" “阿、明日香……”

I smile, "You're crying…"  
我笑着说：“你哭了……”

"I… I just… I'm just happy we…"  
“我……我只是……我很高兴我们……”

"Me too." “我也是。”

I pull him towards me and kiss him gently on the lips. I can feel his tears splashing onto my cheeks, they mix with my own. We don't break the embrace and lay there for a while in each other's arms kissing each other gently and smiling at one another. I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu and this is Shinji Ikari. We're both a little bit fucked up but that's alright, we have each other.  
我把他拉向我，轻轻地吻了他的嘴唇。我能感觉到他的泪水溅到我的脸颊上，它们与我的泪水混合在一起。我们没有松开拥抱，在彼此的怀里躺了一会儿，轻轻地亲吻对方，互相微笑。我是 Asuka Langley Sohryu，这是 Shinji Ikari。我们都有点搞砸了，但没关系，我们有彼此。

**Author's Notes 作者注释**

I've been trying to hold off on Author's Notes on this one until the end, so here they are. This is the end. I don't really want to say too but beyond thank you to everyone who took the time to read this work, who has left a review on it or added it to their favourites. It means so much to have that sort of feedback when writing and it's helped me massively in shaping this work and other pieces that have sprung up around it. I have other stories on the go at the moment, one of which I'm currently editing to put the first chapter of online soon but please let me know what you thought of this. I would like to revisit this particular universe again in the future as I really enjoyed writing from the first person perspective for it. Those will likely be shorter self contained stories similar to what I did for the Human Equation side stories like Notes On A Dream and 6:00 on a Christmas Morning.  
我一直试图把关于这篇文章的作者注释推迟到最后，所以它们就在这里。这就是结局。我其实不想说太多，但除了感谢所有花时间阅读这部作品、留下评论或将其添加到收藏夹的人。在写作时获得此类反馈意义重大，它对我塑造这部作品以及围绕它涌现的其他作品有很大帮助。我现在还有其他故事在忙，我正在编辑其中一个故事，以便很快将第一章发布到网上，但请告诉我你对此的看法。我想在未来再次重温这个特定的宇宙，因为我真的很喜欢从第一人称视角来写作。这些可能会是较短的独立故事，类似于我为《人类方程》支线故事所做的故事，例如《梦的笔记》和《圣诞节早晨的 6:00》。

Once again thank you to everyone who stuck with this.  
再次感谢所有坚持这一点的人。
