A short tale on the effects of misunderstanding the meaning of a single word. Or, what happens when Rei says the word intercourse and Ikari in the same sentence.  
一个关于误解单个词义影响的小故事。或者说，当丽说出“交媾”和“碇”这两个词在同一句话中时会发生什么。

The true power of Tokyo Municipal High School's Class 2-A, known by the name Hikari Horaki, surveyed her domain. All seemed right with the world. Asuka was sitting at her desk, looking bored, Ayanami was looking out the window, a few of the guys were joking, Touji and Kensuke were standing in front of Ikari's empty desk-  
东京市立高中的 2-A 班，以其班长光莉希卡基之名，审视着她的领地。一切似乎都很正常。明日香坐在她的座位上，显得无聊，绫波零望着窗外，几个男生在开玩笑，冬二和健介站在真嗣空荡荡的课桌前——

She paused and doubled back. Ikari wasn't here? Curious, she stepped over to her German friend. "Asuka, where's Ikari?" the class representative asked.  
她停下脚步，折返回来。碇不在吗？她好奇地走向她的德国朋友。“明日香，碇去哪儿了？”班长问道。

The redhead cast an annoyed glance towards her brown haired friend. "How should I know? He was being extra slow today, so I left without him." She drawled, a tone of absolute boredom in her voice. "Maybe he was sick or something."  
红发女孩不悦地瞥了一眼她的棕发朋友。“我怎么知道？他今天特别慢，所以我没等他就走了。”她拖着长音，语气中透着十足的厌烦。“也许他生病了什么的。”

Still, the issue was still pressing. Hikari looked out at who remained. Touji and Kensuke?  
然而，这个问题依然紧迫。光看着剩下的人。东治和健介？

"Sorry, haven't heard from him all weekend."  
"抱歉，整个周末都没他的消息。"

"Me neither." "我也是。"

Were the responses she was given.  
这是她得到的回答。

So that left... 于是就剩下……

Ayanami. 绫波。

While not enamored with the blue haired girl, Hikari liked the fact that Ayanami never caused trouble, or even talked during lessons. Then again, that was also why she wasn't Hikari's favorite person.  
虽然并不迷恋那位蓝发女孩，但光子瑠喜欢绫波从不惹麻烦，甚至在课堂上也不说话的特点。不过，这也正是她不是光子瑠最喜欢的人的原因。

But, her job as class rep demanded she do her duty. It wasn't like Ayanami was scary, either.  
但作为班代表，她的职责要求她履行义务。而且，绫波也不可怕。

"Um... Ayanami?" Hikari asked quietly, drawing the attention of the blue haired girl.  
“呃... 绫波？” 光小心翼翼地问道，吸引了蓝发女孩的注意。

"Yes, Miss Horaki?" she replied questioningly.  
“是的，堀木小姐？” 她带着疑问回答道。

"Have you... do you know why Ikari isn't here today?"  
“你……你知道碇今天为什么没来吗？”

Rei shook her head. "I am sorry, but I have not had intercourse with Ikari recently."  
绫波摇了摇头。“抱歉，我最近没有和碇发生关系。”

The classroom stopped dead, as the sound of jaws dropping echoed throughout the hallways, followed by numerous people falling on their faces.  
教室里顿时鸦雀无声，随后是下巴掉地的声音在走廊里回荡，紧接着许多人摔了个狗啃泥。

Afterwards, silence descended upon the school, indeed, perhaps throughout the entire city.  
事后，学校陷入了寂静，确实，或许整个城市都笼罩在这片静默之中。

And then, like the calm before the storm, it was broken in a tide of voices.  
然后，就像暴风雨前的宁静，这寂静被一阵声浪打破。

"WHAT!" “什么！”

"Shinji's the man!" "真嗣真是太棒了！"

"He's so lucky! Living with Misato and scoring with Rei!"  
"他太幸运了！和美里住在一起，还能和绫波约会！"

"Lucky bastard!" "这家伙真是走运！"

Slowly, Hikari turned towards one person she knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, would not take this news well.  
慢慢地，光转向了一个人，她确信无疑，这个人听到这个消息绝不会平静接受。

Asuka Langely Sohryu had actually stopped everything, and had gone almost as pale as Rei. Her eyes were wide with shock, and pure disbelief was rampant on her features.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷真的停下了所有动作，脸色几乎和丽一样苍白。她的眼睛因震惊而睁大，脸上写满了纯粹的难以置信。

But, like the previous calm, it was broken, but in a most peculiar manner.  
然而，就像之前的平静一样，这种状态也被打破了，但方式颇为奇特。

The redhead's eyes flashed with a myriad of emotions. Betrayal, anger, jealousy, sadness...  
红发少女的眼中闪过无数情绪。背叛、愤怒、嫉妒、悲伤……

"You little slut!" Asuka snarled, leaping from her chair to deliver her mighty slap-  
“你这个小荡妇！”明日香咆哮着，从椅子上跳起，挥出她那有力的耳光——

Which Rei blocked calmly, impassively with one hand, grasping the irate Second Child's wrist. "I am not a slut. I have merely stated I have not had any intercourse with Pilot Ikari since Friday."  
绫波丽平静地、面无表情地用一只手挡住了，紧紧抓住了愤怒的第二适格者的手腕。“我不是荡妇。我只是声明自周五以来，我没有与碇真嗣发生过任何性关系。”

"You-you..." the pilot of Unit 02 stopped, tears welling in her eyes. Without a word, she stormed out of the classroom, screaming profanities as she left.  
"你...你..." 二号机驾驶员停了下来，泪水在她的眼中打转。她一言不发，冲出教室，边走边尖声咒骂。

Small children, animals, birds, and Section Two agents scattered in her wake.  
小孩子们、动物、鸟儿，还有第二分部的特工们，在她身后四散奔逃。

---

Elsewhere, in the biggest, emptiest office man has ever built...  
在别处，人类建造过的最大、最空旷的办公室里...

Gendo Ikari was not a man easily shaken. Death threats, screamed profanities, the hatred of his only son... all of it never even fazed the Supreme Commander of NERV.  
碇源堂不是一个容易被撼动的人。死亡威胁、尖叫的咒骂、他唯一儿子的憎恨...这一切从未让 NERV 最高指挥官动摇过。

This was man who gambled with the lives of every human being on a daily basis, who worked for and against Seele, and who managed to look damn imposing just by sitting at a desk all day.  
这是一个每天都在以全人类的生命为赌注的人，他为 Seele 工作同时也与之对抗，仅仅坐在办公桌前就能显得非常令人敬畏。

Right now, he was busy scrambling back into his chair, having fallen out of it with shock.  
此刻，他正忙着从地上爬回椅子，刚刚因为震惊而摔了下来。

His second in command, Sub Commander Fuyutsuki, who normally looked like a stone statue, was trying desperately not to fall to the ground laughing. Currently, he was still struggling with sniggers.  
他的副手，副指挥官冬月，平时看起来像座石雕，此刻正拼命忍住不笑到地上打滚。眼下，他仍在努力克制着窃笑。

"Say that again, agent?" the Commander drawled disbelievingly.  
"再说一遍，特工？"指挥官带着难以置信的语气拖长声音问道。

"The First Child has stated she has not had... intercourse with the Third for a few days sir." The agent replied, struggling to hold back a laugh.  
"第一适格者声称她已经好几天没有……与第三适格者发生关系了，长官。"特工回答道，努力憋住笑意。

At this point, Gendo was torn.  
此时此刻，碇源堂内心矛盾重重。

On the one hand, there was a torrent of emotions about his son.  
一方面，他对儿子充满了复杂的情感。

Pride and slight jealousy. His son had gotten laid a hell of a lot faster than him.  
既有骄傲，也有一丝嫉妒。他的儿子比他更快地找到了伴侣。

Relief that his son was inclined to the fairer sex (he had been wondering, what with living with Katsuragi and the Second).  
欣慰的是，他的儿子似乎对异性有兴趣（毕竟和 Katsuragi 以及 Second 住在一起，他一直有些担心）。

These all made him want to do a very uncharacteristic thing- i.e., jump and cheer for his son.  
这一切让他想做一件非常不符合他性格的事——即，跳起来为他的儿子欢呼。

Then there was Rei. 然后是零。

Fury. This was not in the scenario, and his son should not be sleeping with a clone that had even a tiny bit of his own mother's D.N.A.  
愤怒。这不在剧本之内，他的儿子不应该与一个哪怕只有一丝他母亲 D.N.A.的克隆体同床共枕。

Shame that Rei would... give herself so easily.  
遗憾的是丽会……如此轻易地献身。

In the end, the Commander just stared at the screen blankly, with a dumbfounded expression on his face.  
最终，司令只是茫然地盯着屏幕，脸上带着一副目瞪口呆的表情。

"This... was definitely not in the scenario."  
"这...绝对不在剧本里。"

---

Elsewhere, the rest of NERV was getting the news...  
在别处，NERV 的其他成员正在接收消息...

"WHAT!" "什么！"

And not taking it with the best grace.  
而且接受得并不十分情愿。

Misato Katsuragi just stared blankly at her fake blonde friend. "Uh... you're joking, right? Please say you're joking."  
葛城美里茫然地盯着她那位金发假朋友。“呃……你在开玩笑吧？请说你在开玩笑。”

"I'm afraid not," Ritsuko replied calmly, though slightly pertubed herself. "This is directly from Rei's own mouth."  
“恐怕不是，”律子平静地回答，尽管她自己也有些不安。“这是直接从绫波自己嘴里说出来的。”

A few nonsensical words made an exodus from the Major's mouth as she gaped.  
几声无意义的嘟囔从玛丽少校的嘴里冒出，她目瞪口呆。

Kaji chuckled slightly. "I had my money on Asuka personally, but good on you Shinji. I'm glad _someone's_ getting some."  
加持轻笑了一声。“我本来赌是明日香，不过干得好，真嗣。我很高兴有人能得到幸福。”

Misato slapped him angrily, huffing and puffing. "I don't know whether to slap that boy or to hug him..." she murmured, rubbing her forehead.  
美里生气地拍了他一下，气呼呼地喘着气。“我不知道该打那小子还是抱他……”她喃喃自语，揉着额头。

Nearby, Aoba grinned as Makoto sadly handed him the last of his precious chocolate stash.  
附近，Aoba 咧嘴笑着，Makoto 伤心地递给他最后一点珍贵的巧克力存货。

"I knew that Ikari would bag Ayanami." The bridge bunny grinned triumphantly.  
“我就知道 Ikari 会搞定 Ayanami。”这位桥上的小兔子得意地咧嘴笑道。

"Damn it... I was so sure it would be Asuka." Makoto murmured bitterly, gazing longingly at the chocolate he previously owned. "My precious chocolate!"  
“该死……我之前那么确定会是 Asuka。”Makoto 苦涩地低语，恋恋不舍地望着他曾经拥有的巧克力。“我的宝贝巧克力啊！”

And elsewhere, in the Evangelion hangar, the technicians could have sworn that Unit 01 let out a pleased growl, changing its normally maniacal smile to a proud one. And as if that wasn't enough, Unit 02 seemed to be put out somewhat, even letting out a slight huff.  
而在别处，在 EVA 机库中，技术人员们发誓初号机发出了一声满意的低吼，将其惯常的狂乱笑容转变为自豪的微笑。仿佛这还不够，二号机似乎有些不悦，甚至发出了一声轻微的哼声。

It was enough to send most of them into asylums for the rest of their natural lives.  
这足以让大多数人余生都在精神病院中度过。

---

Shinji Ikari stumbled out of bed, feeling terrible, a nasty cold striking the mighty pilot down. His recent bout of constant sneezing was not helping, either.  
碇真嗣跌跌撞撞地从床上爬起来，感觉糟透了，一场严重的感冒击倒了这位强大的驾驶员。他最近持续不断的喷嚏也毫无帮助。

As he aimlessly flipped channels, he briefly wondered if people were talking about him.  
他漫无目的地切换着频道，一时好奇人们是否在谈论他。

"Nah... why would they?" he shrugged nonchalantly. He glanced over at Pen-Pen. "Do you think people are talking about me?"  
"不会吧...他们为什么要谈我？" 他无所谓地耸了耸肩。他瞥了一眼 Pen-Pen，"你觉得有人在说我吗？"

"Wark." "哇克。"

"Of course. Stupid question."  
"当然。真蠢的问题。"

"Wark." "哇克。"

"No, you can't have the remote." Shinji might be Asuka and Misato's veritable servant, but he'd be damned if he'd take orders from a penguin.  
"不行，遥控器不能给你。" 真嗣可能是明日香和美里的事实上的仆人，但他绝不会听从一只企鹅的命令。

He had his pride... albeit one the size of a flea.  
他有他的骄傲...尽管那骄傲小得像只跳蚤。

It was then that he had the Feeling.  
就在那时，他有了那种感觉。

It wasn't an ordinary feeling... it was that special, sixth sense that told him one thing.  
这不是普通的感觉...这是一种特别的、第六感，告诉了他一件事。

DOOM was upon him, manifest in a very, very angry Asuka Langely Sohryu.  
毁灭即将降临，具体表现为极度愤怒的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

Immediately, he scanned for a way out. Door? Too conventional. Window? Suicidal. Balcony? Same.  
他立刻四处寻找逃生之路。门？太普通了。窗户？自寻死路。阳台？一样。

Hide in room, curl up into a fetal position and cry like a little girl? Tempting, but useless.  
躲在房间里，蜷缩成胎儿姿势像小女孩一样哭泣？诱人，但无济于事。

He looked at Pen-Pen, an idea forming in his mind.  
他看着 Pen-Pen，心中生出一个主意。

In response, the penguin replied indignantly, "Wark!"  
作为回应，企鹅不满地叫了一声，“哇克！”

"Hey, its you or me!"  
“嘿，不是你就是我！”

"WARK!" "哇克！"

"Fine... see if I help you anytime!" Shinji replied indignantly, watching the penguin run for cover.  
"好吧...看我以后还会不会帮你！" 真嗣愤愤不平地回答，看着企鹅跑去躲藏。

Closing his eyes, he awaited the storm.  
他闭上眼睛，等待着风暴的来临。

And it came. 然后它来了。

The door burst off its hinges, as if Asuka was projecting her own A.T. field. The Third Child cast her a look of utter fear, which was met with... betrayal?  
门猛地被撞开，仿佛明日香在投射自己的 A.T.力场。第三适格者向她投去一个充满恐惧的眼神，而回应的是……背叛？

It passed, and Shinji was knocked down by a particularly nasty slap.  
这一切过去了，真嗣被一记特别狠的耳光打倒在地。

"You... PERVERT!" And with that, she went off into a nasty tangent of German and Japanese curses, which promised him slow, torturous death by means never even dreamed by the Geneva Convention.  
"你... 变态！" 说完，她开始用德语和日语混合着恶毒的咒骂，诅咒他遭受一种连日内瓦公约都未曾梦见过的缓慢而痛苦的死亡。

"What did I do!" Shinji asked angrily, holding his cheek. That was going to sting for the next week.  
"我做了什么！" 真嗣愤怒地问道，捂着脸颊。接下来的一个星期，那里都会隐隐作痛。

Asuka shot him a furious glare and stormed off into her room.  
明日香狠狠地瞪了他一眼，怒气冲冲地走进自己的房间。

Sighing, the Third Child sank into the couch again, rubbing his aching cheek. "What's her proble-"  
叹了口气，第三适格者再次陷进沙发里，揉着疼痛的脸颊。“她有什么问题——”

That sentence was interrupted by the arrival of an irate Major Katsuragi, who shot him a deadly glare. She opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by a second voice.  
这句话被愤怒的葛城美里少校打断了，她投来致命的一瞥。她张嘴正要说话，却被另一个声音打断。

"Wait to go Shinji! I didn't think you had it in you!" Kaji said proudly, slapping the pilot's back, nearly making the Third cough up a lung.  
“干得好，真嗣！没想到你还有这一手！”加持自豪地说道，拍了拍驾驶员的背，差点让第三适格者咳出肺来。

"Oh, you would say that!" Misato growled, and with that, was lost berating Kaji.  
"哦，你当然会这么说！" 美里咆哮道，随即陷入对加持的责骂中。

Seeing an opportunity, Shinji cast the older man an apologetic glance as he ran headlong from the apartment.  
看到机会，真嗣向那位年长男子投去歉意的目光，随即飞奔出公寓。

"HEY! GET BACK HERE SHINJI!"  
"嘿！真嗣，给我回来！"

"RUN SHINJI! RUN!" "快跑，真嗣！快跑！"

Deciding that Kaji's advice was better, the pilot of Unit 01 ran, ran until he accidentally ran into someone else.  
真嗣决定听从加持的建议，驾驶初号机的他跑了起来，直到不小心撞上了别人。

"Ouch..." Shinji muttered, but gasped when he saw who he run into. Rei rubbed her own head, staggering back to her feet. He offered her his hand, which the blue haired girl took wordlessly.  
"哎哟..." 真嗣咕哝着，但当他看清撞到的人时，不禁倒吸一口凉气。绫波揉着自己的头，踉跄着站起身来。他向她伸出手，蓝发少女默默地握住了他的手。

"Are you okay, Pilot Ikari?" Rei asked quietly.  
"碇司令，你还好吗？" 绫波零轻声问道。

"Yeah... what is with everyone today?" Shinji murmured indignantly. He smiled at the First Child. "At least you're not being weird today, Ayanami." He paused, and looked curiously at her. "Did something happen?"  
"嗯...今天大家是怎么了？" 真嗣不满地嘟囔着。他向第一适格者微笑道："至少你今天没那么奇怪，绫波。" 他顿了顿，好奇地看着她。"发生了什么事吗？"

"I was questioned by Hikari Horaki on your reasons for not attending school. When I told them I had not had intercourse-"  
"我被洞木光询问你缺席学校的原因。当我告诉她们我没有发生性行为时——"

"Ayanami, I told you, don't call it that." Shinji said, blushing furiously.  
“绫波，我说过，别那样叫它。”真嗣说道，脸红得厉害。

The First nodded. "I told them we had not spoken as of late." She corrected.  
第一适格者点了点头。“我告诉他们我们最近没有交谈。”她纠正道。

"Ah... wait... did you say intercourse in class?" the pilot of Unit 01 asked, a silent groan in his voice. _Please, please, please..._  
"“啊……等等……你说在课堂上谈论性行为？”初号机驾驶员问道，声音中带着无声的呻吟。拜托，拜托，拜托……”

"I did." Rei paused, looking at him questioningly. "Was this not appropriate?"  
"我做了。" 丽停顿了一下，疑惑地看着他。"这样不合适吗？"

"People might misunderstand what you mean, Ayanami." Shinji replied quietly, a light blush on his cheeks.  
"人们可能会误解你的意思，绫波。" 真嗣轻声回答，脸颊上泛起淡淡的红晕。"

"People are strange." The pilot of Unit 00 commented.  
"人们很奇怪。" 零号机驾驶员评论道。"

"Yeah. They are." “是啊，他们是。”

AN: An odd little piece, to be death threats, etc. should be left in a review. I'm not to be held responsible for any mental damage this fic has caused.

### Comment
[Pyeknu](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/58246/Pyeknu): LMAO! Rei can be a very cunning girl, ne?
🍋丽是一个狡猾的女孩，不是吗？

[Lord Sia](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1431986/Lord-Sia): Ha! I actually had to check the dictionary, I can see so much potential in using that little grammatical loophole against my friends... And as for grinning Evas; fuck yeah I'd piss my pants if I was tending to a 100-metre artificial giant SUPPOSED to be INACTIVE and it suddenly grinned. Similar to some fics where the dormant Eva suddenly burst out laughing, causing an entire shift of technicians and guards to be rendered permanently catatonic...
哈！我还真得查查字典，我发现利用这个小小的语法漏洞来对付我的朋友还真是大有可为...... 至于咧嘴笑的伊娃，如果我在照顾一个 100 米长的人造巨人，而它本该是不活动的，却突然咧嘴笑了，我肯定会吓得尿裤子。就像在一些小说中，休眠的伊娃突然大笑起来，导致一整班技术人员和警卫永久性精神错乱......

[TaraLi](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/931754/TaraLi): There's just something about Rei - Luna Lovegood strongly reminds me of her. However, always thought Rei would be perfect for Shinji, once they both got past NERV.
玲身上有一种东西--露娜-洛夫古德（Luna Lovegood）让我深深地想起了她。不过，我一直觉得玲和真嗣很般配，只要他们都能摆脱 NERV 的束缚。

[Lord Cynic](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/30617/Lord-Cynic): Oh, this is gold! Trust Rei to say something like that in the most casual and nonchalent way possible. I applaud this for its technique, because if I did for its pervertedness I'd get hit by a lot of the female population... eh...
哦，这是金子！相信玲会用最随意、最淡然的方式说出这样的话。我为它的技巧而喝彩，因为如果我为它的变态而喝彩的话，我会被很多女性打......嗯......

[Shadowfox83](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/609065/Shadowfox83): Flat out hilarious is the best way for me to describe this fic. Its funny how the wrong defintion of a word can lead to something like this happening, poor Shinji he'll never live this one down lol._Anyway great fic with some excellent humor, good job._
用 “爆笑 ”来形容这篇小说再合适不过了。一个词的错误定义会导致这样的事情发生，真可笑，可怜的真嗣永远也忘不了这个词。 _不管怎么说，这篇小说很棒，而且非常幽默，写得很好。_

vic: very funny. true, it wouldn't work in the japanese language, but it makes a lot of sense that Ayanami would have said something like that. good characterization, exept maybe on gendo's part (but i forgive you cause u had too). a great story.
非常有趣。的确，用日语说这句话是行不通的，但 Ayanami 说出这样的话还是很有道理的。人物刻画得很好，除了 gendo 的部分（但我原谅了你，因为你不得不这样做）。

convictionsareprisons: That was great! The joke was an interesting play on the typical Rei/Shinji dynamic seen in a lot of comedies. The absolute best part was that I could just picture her saying that and everyone reacting like that. Though you'd think a few people besides Shinji would figure out what she was trying to say. Keep writing this type of quality stuff and you'll get yourself a dedicated fanbase.
真是太棒了！这个笑话是对许多喜剧片中典型的玲和慎二动态的有趣发挥。最棒的是，我能想象出她说这句话时大家的反应。虽然你会觉得除了真嗣之外，还有几个人会明白她想说什么。继续写这种高质量的作品，你会拥有一批忠实的粉丝。

[GreekGeek81](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/488158/GreekGeek81): That is SUCH an Ayanami moment. This should be canon, my friend. Thank you for giving the world such an hilarious outlook on the proper use of the English language. DON'T mess up your words because it might make you sound cool or high and mighty. This is what happens. Poor poor Shinji.
这就是绫波时刻。这应该成为正典，我的朋友。谢谢你让世界看到了正确使用英语的有趣前景。不要因为听起来很酷或趾高气扬就乱说话。这就是结果。可怜的真嗣
