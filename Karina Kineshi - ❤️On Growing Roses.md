### Prologue

"You want us to shovel _shit_?!" Sohryu Asuka Langley leapt to her feet, eyes ablaze. Never one for sugarcoating statements, she found the teacher's suggestion infuriating. "Is it our fault that we have to save you every time an Angel attacks? We're getting _punished_ for this?"  
"你想让我们铲屎？！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷猛地站起身，眼中怒火中烧。她向来不喜欢拐弯抹角，觉得老师的提议简直荒谬至极。"每次使徒来袭都是我们救了你们，难道这还是我们的错吗？我们凭什么要因此受罚？"

"Miss Langley, if you'll let me explain**–**"  
"兰格雷小姐，请让我解释一下——"

She stomped her foot on the ground, not willing to be appeased. "Are we convicts? Why do _we_ have to do this?"  
她重重地跺了跺脚，丝毫不愿接受安抚。"我们是犯人吗？为什么要做这种事？"

The entire class cowered behind their desks, fearful of the redhead's temper. She had barely been here a week, yet the not-so-subtle way everyone kept their distance from her was striking. Shinji pleaded silently with whatever God existed to make her stop ranting. Someone had to have the balls to stand up and calm her down, someone had to...  
全班同学都躲在课桌后，害怕红发女孩的脾气。她才来不到一周，但大家与她保持距离的那种不那么微妙的方式却十分明显。真嗣默默祈求任何存在的神明让她停止咆哮。总得有人有勇气站出来安抚她，总得有人……

His prayers were answered in the form of Touji Suzuhara.  
他的祈祷得到了回应，来人是铃原东治。

"Sit down, Devil Woman."  
“坐下，恶魔女。”

Shinji groaned. That wasn't really the answer he was expecting. All the students cringed, waiting for the thrashing verbal or otherwise the poor jock had brought upon himself.  
真嗣呻吟了一声。这并不是他期待的答案。所有学生都缩了缩脖子，等待着那个可怜的运动员自找的、无论是言语上还是其他形式的责骂。

Asuka glared at Touji, who stared back, hands behind head in a manner of ultimate relaxation. It didn't seem to faze him one bit. After a few heartbeats, Asuka sank into her seat. Once down there, she flipped her hair over her shoulder and sneered. "You're just an idiot, anyways."  
明日香瞪着铃原，后者也回瞪着她，双手枕在脑后，一副极度放松的样子。这似乎一点也没影响到他。几拍心跳过后，明日香坐回了自己的座位。一坐下，她就把头发甩到肩后，冷笑道：“反正你也就是个白痴。”

No one spoke. The teacher wiped his forehead with his hideous yellow tie, no doubt wondering why he hadn't already retired. "Err, thank you, Mr. Suzuhara..."  
没有人说话。老师用他那丑陋的黄色领带擦了擦额头，无疑在想为什么自己还没退休。“呃，谢谢你，铃原同学……”

The redhead started mumbling unintelligibly again, but the storm had already passed. Everyone dared to relax into their seats, but only slightly.  
红发女孩又开始含糊不清地咕哝，但风暴已经过去。大家都敢稍微放松地坐回座位，只是略微放松。

"...err, now... as I was saying... the recent Angel attack left our city in shambles..."  
"...呃，现在... 正如我刚才所说... 最近的使徒袭击让我们的城市变得一片狼藉..."

Everyone's eyes immediately darted over to Asuka. "I already told you, Shinji did that, not me."  
所有人的目光立刻转向明日香。"我已经告诉过你们了，那是真嗣干的，不是我。"

The teacher put up his hands and started sweating profusely. "Fine, Miss Langley, we aren't here to point fingers. As I was saying... yes, please pass these out for me Miss Horaki... thank you..."  
老师举起双手，开始大汗淋漓。“好吧，兰利小姐，我们不是来指责谁的。正如我刚才所说……是的，请帮我分发一下这些，洞木小姐……谢谢……”

The teacher rambled on. Although whatever he had to say was probably pretty important, Shinji found his attention occupied by something else. Right after Asuka had declared that the destruction to the city was all his fault, Kensuke shot him a look and typed something on his laptop. Seconds later...  
老师继续喋喋不休。尽管他要说的事情可能相当重要，但真嗣的注意力却被其他事情占据了。就在明日香宣称城市的破坏都是他的错之后，剑介看了他一眼，并在笔记本电脑上敲了些什么。几秒钟后……

Liar. I got proof  
骗子。我有证据

Shinji blinked at the red 36-point font Kensuke used for all his personal messages. After his retinas burned through his eyes, he typed back: What are you talking about?  
真嗣对着剑介所有个人消息都使用的红色 36 号字体眨了眨眼。视网膜被灼烧后，他回复道：你在说什么？

The response was immediate. Check it out  
回复立刻就来了。快看这个

A new window popped on screen. After viewing it, Shinji closed the window and sighed. You really shouldn't be videotaping Evangelions in combat. Isn't that a security breach or something?  
屏幕上弹出了一个新窗口。看完后，真嗣关闭了窗口并叹了口气。你真的不应该在战斗中录像福音战士。那不是安全漏洞之类的吗？

He could see Kensuke snicker at his screen. I'm documenting it, not taping it  
他能看到健介对着屏幕窃笑。我是在记录，不是在录像

Is there a difference?  
有区别吗？

Kensuke turned around, shrugged at him, and accepted a paper Hikari passed out. Seeing as how she was still on the other side of the room, Shinji replayed the "documentary" that was sent. Even though the video was captured without sound, Shinji could still hear the clangs and groans of that fight in his mind.  
健介转过身来，对他耸了耸肩，接过了光子递来的纸。既然她还在房间的另一头，真嗣重播了那部被发送过来的“纪录片”。尽管视频是无声拍摄的，真嗣仍能在脑海中听到那场战斗的铿锵声和呻吟声。

Israfel. 伊斯拉斐尔。

He shook his head when the giant purple Eva was thrown into the air and landed face down in the sea, but chuckled when Asuka's Unit 02 cheerily crushed buildings under foot while trying to hack the Angel in two. Then it was Asuka who first lost timing during the synchronized attack, catapulting both Evas into a pit of fire and molten rock...  
当巨大的紫色 EVA 被抛向空中，脸朝下落入海中时，他摇了摇头，但当明日香的 02 号机欢快地踩踏着建筑物，试图将使徒劈成两半时，他又轻声笑了起来。随后，在同步攻击中，明日香首先失去了节奏，将两台 EVA 都抛入了一个火与熔岩的深坑……

The video cut out briefly after blanking out. Then it started shaking up and down, giving a dizzying view of both sky and ground. It made the Third Child feel queasy just _looking_ at it. After the zoom tried to focus (and failed), the video spun around and Shinji found himself video to face with—  
视频短暂地黑屏后突然中断。接着开始上下晃动，呈现出令人晕眩的天空与地面交替的画面。这让第三适格者仅仅看着就感到恶心。在尝试聚焦（却失败）后，视频旋转起来，真嗣发现自己正面对着——

"Aida Kensuke!" “相田剑介！”

On reflex, Shinji slammed his laptop shut and looked around dazedly. Hikari pulled Kensuke's ear and demanded to know why he threw the paper in the trash. He replied that he didn't want to come. She yelled that his opinion didn't matter; it was a school function and he must attend.  
出于本能，真嗣猛地合上笔记本电脑，茫然地环顾四周。光子拽着剑介的耳朵，质问他为什么把纸扔进垃圾桶。他回答说自己不想来。她大声说他的意见不重要；这是学校活动，他必须参加。

Remembering his oath to help a friend in need, Shinji raised his hand. "Can... can I have a paper?"  
想起自己帮助有需要的朋友的誓言，真嗣举起了手。“我……我可以要一张纸吗？”

Instead of having Hikari answer him, Asuka slammed her paper down on his desk. "Read it." Shinji did so...

**On Growing Roses...**By: Karina Kineshi (coronaflare@mail.com)  
《论玫瑰的成长》... 作者：Karina Kineshi (coronaflare@mail.com)

"What kind of a lame ass title is _that_?"  
“这算什么烂标题啊？”

Shinji shuffled beside me, still examining that paper. "On Growing Roses..." he mumbled. I didn't know how he could walk and read at the same time, especially since he had his face buried in it.  
真嗣在我旁边挪动着，仍在仔细研究那张纸。“《论玫瑰的成长》...”他喃喃自语。我不知道他是怎么做到边走边读的，尤其是他的脸几乎埋在了纸上。

I rolled my eyes. "Geez, it's not _that_ interesting."  
我翻了个白眼。“天啊，没那么有趣吧。”

He stared at it for a couple of seconds more before folding it in quarters and giving it to me. "Misato will make us do this, you know."  
他又盯着它看了几秒钟，然后将其对折四次递给我。“你知道的，美里会让我们做这个。”

I sneered, grabbed the paper, and stuffed it into my schoolbag. Despite the woman being a total slob when it came to living, she was actually quite an environmentalist. Even had those crazy color-coded bins in her kitchen, one for glass, one for paper, one full of beer cans... "Is this the thanks we get for saving them from the Angels?"  
我嗤之以鼻，抓过纸张塞进书包。尽管那女人生活上一塌糊涂，实际上却是个环保主义者。厨房里甚至有那些疯狂的彩色分类垃圾桶，一个放玻璃，一个放纸，还有一个满是啤酒罐……“我们救了他们免受使徒侵扰，这就是我们的感谢吗？”

He shrugged. "I guess this is the least we can do after destroying half the city."  
他耸了耸肩。“我想这是我们在毁掉半个城市后能做的最少的事了。”

As much as I wanted to come back with a snappy answer, I found I couldn't. It was true. "Well, those buildings shouldn't have been in the way then."  
尽管我想要回一个机智的答案，却发现我做不到。这是真的。“好吧，那些建筑本就不该挡在路上。”

It was a flyer advertising EarthSave day. Oddly enough, I didn't remember seeing this date circled on the calendar at home**,** because I'm sure Misato would never let something like this get by her. Rumor was that it had been declared just because our latest fight left the south side flattened. Fortunately, we found out that there hadn't been any people hurt and they were going to clear that area for a park...  
这是一张宣传地球保护日的传单。奇怪的是，我不记得在家里的日历上看到过这个日期被圈出来，因为我确信美里绝不会让这样的事情被忽视。传言说，这个日子被宣布正是因为我们最近的战斗把南边夷为平地。幸运的是，我们得知没有人员受伤，他们打算清理那片区域建一个公园……

"They want us to plant trees? Roses?"  
"他们要我们种树？玫瑰？"

Shinji nodded. "This part we're working on is supposed to be a rose garden. But, the area hasn't been cleared of rubble and stuff yet."  
真嗣点点头。"这部分我们负责的区域应该是玫瑰园。不过，这里还没清理掉碎石杂物。"

I put my hands on my hips. "How the hell do you know that?"  
我双手叉腰。"你怎么知道这些的？"

"It was in the paper. They must want us to move the rocks first..."  
"报纸上写了。他们肯定是要我们先搬石头..."

Sweaty manual labor. Hauling boulders bigger than Touji's ego. Throwing smelly compost on rose beds. Putting up with tree-hugging hippies. All at eight in the morning.  
累人的体力活。搬运比东治自尊心还大的巨石。往玫瑰花床上撒臭烘烘的堆肥。忍受那些抱树的嬉皮士。一大早八点就开始。

Oh yeah. This was going to be loads of fun.  
哦，没错。这肯定会非常有趣。

"What I still can't believe is..." I opened the door to Misato's apartment and strode inside, "... our teacher has the gall to call this a 'field trip'."  
“我至今仍难以置信的是……”我打开美里小姐的公寓门，大步走了进去，“……我们的老师居然有脸把这称为‘实地考察’。”

"I guess it's better than being lectured on Second Impact..."  
“我想这总比听关于第二次冲击的讲座要好……”

I fished around in my briefcase and threw the flyer on the table. He had a point. I don't know which was the greater evil, but I'd much rather be moving than sitting around listening to something I've heard before. Besides, Mr. Sasaki was just parroting whatever NERV told the public. It was a lie.  
"我在公文包里摸索了一番，将传单扔在桌上。他说的没错。我不知道哪个更糟糕，但我宁愿动起来，也不想坐着听那些我已经听过的话。再者，佐佐木先生不过是鹦鹉学舌，重复 NERV 告诉公众的谎言罢了。”

"Hey Shinji?" When I got no answer, I took off my shoes and sighed. He probably already had his earphones in and was relaxing on the couch, staring blankly at the ceiling.  
“嘿，真嗣？” 没有得到回应，我脱下鞋子叹了口气。他大概已经戴上了耳机，正躺在沙发上，茫然地盯着天花板。

After changing out of my uniform and into my lounge clothes, I took something else out of my schoolbag. "Do you know anything about this?"  
换下制服，穿上休闲装后，我从书包里拿出了另一样东西。“你知道这是什么吗？”

Shinji took a temporary break from his music (it was Tuesday, Tuesday is Vivaldi day) and stared at the items in my hand. "You got more?"  
真嗣暂停了他的音乐（今天是星期二，星期二是维瓦尔第日），盯着我手里的物品。“你还有更多吗？”

I scowled and waved the love letters in front of his face. I must have had at least ten clenched in my fist. "Your friends are all morons. Every guy in the _school_ is a moron. Though I have to admit..." I picked out a random letter and read the front. "... it's flattering to be called 'An Angel Incarnate'." I put them on the table and sat down beside Shinji. "I really hope there's no double meaning in that."  
我皱着眉头，把那些情书挥舞在他面前。我手里至少攥着十封。“你的朋友们都是白痴。学校里的每个男生都是白痴。不过我得承认……”我随手抽出一封信，念着封面上的字。“……被称为‘天使化身’确实让人受宠若惊。”我把信放在桌上，坐在真嗣旁边。“我真心希望这里面没有双关含义。”

He smiled at me. "Writing love letters isn't easy, you know."  
他对我微笑。“写情书可不容易，你知道的。”

"And what would you know about writing love letters, Third?"  
“那你又对写情书了解多少呢，三笠？”

Shinji blushed and put an earplug back in. "Nothing, really."  
真嗣脸红了，重新塞上耳塞。“没什么，真的。”

I picked up all the letters again and started shuffling them. "'The One I Love Is you', 'my Phoenix Rising', 'Lean on Me', 'you Burn my soul', 'if being with you is the Price of Life, I'll pay it...'... _Scheisse_. They're freakin' terrible at addressing these." When I came across one vulgarly titled "I Smell Sex and Candy", I instantly ripped it up and fumed. "Morons."  
我又捡起所有的信，开始整理。“‘我爱的人是你’，‘我的凤凰涅槃’，‘依靠我’，‘你燃烧我的灵魂’，‘如果与你在一起是生命的代价，我愿意付出’……该死。他们写这些信的称呼真是糟糕透顶。”当我翻到一封标题粗俗的“我闻到了性与糖果的味道”时，我立刻撕碎了它，气愤地说：“白痴。”

The boy beside me kept gazing at the ceiling.  
我旁边的男孩一直盯着天花板看。

It was about this time I realized... I was bored.  
大约就在这时，我意识到...我感到无聊了。

God save us all.  
愿上帝保佑我们所有人。

"Hey Shinji... have you ever written a love letter before?"  
“嘿，真嗣...你以前写过情书吗？”

He blinked, quickly shook his head and stammered. "N-No."  
他眨了眨眼，迅速摇摇头，结结巴巴地说：“不——不。”

"Do you want to learn how?"  
“你想学吗？”

The Third Child stared some more. "Uh..."  
第三适格者又盯着看了会儿。“呃……”

I figured, hell, maybe he'd like to learn. And it would be nice to know that all men weren't idiots and get a love letter done the right way for once.  
我想，见鬼，也许他会愿意学。而且知道不是所有男人都是白痴，能有一次正确地写好情书，感觉也不错。

I grabbed his arm and hauled him to his feet when he didn't answer. Done. "I'll teach you how... but only because you're a spineless loser who could use my help." I whirled him into a chair at the kitchen table and reached on top of the refrigerator. I handed him an assortment of pens and put my hands on my hips. "Now, thank me."  
他没回答，我便抓住他的胳膊把他拽起来。搞定。“我来教你……不过只因为你是个没骨气的失败者，需要我的帮助。”我把他转进厨房桌边的椅子，伸手从冰箱顶上拿了一堆笔递给他，双手叉腰。“现在，谢我。”

It wasn't a suggestion.  
这不是建议。

"T-Thank you, Asuka..." His hands were shaking.  
"谢谢你，明日香..." 他的手在颤抖。

I grinned and gestured to the flyer on the table. "Flip that over. Yes. That's your canvas. In your hand you have the power to... yeah, pick that up... now, the first thing you have to do is address it."  
我咧嘴一笑，指着桌上的传单。“翻过来。对。那就是你的画布。你手中握有...没错，拿起它...现在，你要做的第一件事就是向它打招呼。”

When he didn't move for several seconds, I knew that he was in trouble.  
当他几秒钟都没有动弹时，我知道他陷入了困境。

"You know, a salutation."  
"你知道的，一种问候语。"

He blinked. 他眨了眨眼。

"You do know what a salutation is, right?"  
"你确实知道什么是问候语，对吧？"

"Yeah... but... what am I supposed to..." he trailed off.  
“是啊...但是...我该怎么做...”他话音渐弱。

I fought the urge to give up so soon; after all, if anyone could teach a weak willed boy to become a Casanova, it was me. I then realized how absurd that sounded, even in my mind. My God, what mess have I gotten myself into now? "You're going to take a lot of work."  
我强忍着立刻放弃的冲动；毕竟，如果有人能将一个意志薄弱的男孩培养成情场高手，那非我莫属。随即我意识到这想法在我脑海中听起来多么荒谬。天哪，我现在到底卷入了什么麻烦？“这可得费不少功夫。”

The boy sighed. 男孩叹了口气。

I clapped my hands together, trying to revive my falling spirit. "Now listen up. Let's start with the basics. First, the paper. Well... if you want to wow the girl you're writing this to, simple white paper won't do. You get your wallet out, pay an extra yen for nice paper. Most guys don't know that it's all about presentation. Stationary with hearts, bunnies, sunshine, whatever. Bonus points if scented."  
我拍了拍手，试图振作起自己逐渐低落的情绪。“现在听好了。我们从基础开始。首先是纸张。嗯……如果你想让收信的女孩眼前一亮，普通的白纸可不行。你得掏出钱包，多花点钱买些好纸。大多数男生不知道，关键在于呈现方式。带有心形、兔子、阳光等图案的信纸，如果有香味那就更棒了。”

Shinji nodded and stared into the space behind me. He wasn't looking at me anymore, and I hate it when people blank out while I'm talking. I hate that almost as much as wet hair on my shoulders.  
真嗣点点头，目光越过我望向身后。他不再看我，而我讨厌别人在我说话时走神。这几乎和湿漉漉的头发贴在肩膀上一样让我讨厌。

"Hey, Shinji?" That must have been too much for him to process.  
“嘿，真嗣？”他一定是被这些信息弄得不知所措了。

_It's only stationary, Shinji._ I thought. _If you can't handle—_  
这只是静止的画面，真嗣。我以为。如果你无法承受——

My thoughts were interrupted as a shadow fell over the table from behind. Shinji's eyes had a crazed, almost frightened glint. "M-M... Misato... you're—"  
我的思绪被从背后投射到桌上的阴影打断。真嗣的眼神狂乱，几乎带着恐惧。“美...美里...你——”

"_Misato?!_" I spun around; right into our guardian's smiling face.  
“美里？！”我转过身；正好撞上我们监护人的笑脸。

"Hello, Shinji." “你好，真嗣。”

This woman must take great pleasure in giving me heart attacks. Acting as composed as possible, I coolly breathed, "Hello, Misato." I simultaneously scooted over and tried to cover her sight of the table. If she found out I was teaching Shinji how to write a love letter...  
这个女人肯定很享受给我制造心脏病。我尽可能保持镇定，冷冷地呼吸道：“你好，美里。”同时我挪了挪位置，试图挡住她对桌子的视线。如果她发现我在教真嗣写情书……

_Oh God. 哦，天哪。_

Misato didn't seem to see. "What are you guys doing?"  
美里似乎没注意到。“你们在干什么呢？”

My eyes flitted over to Shinji, and he started stammering in a pathetic attempt to buy time. The look I gave him said that if he didn't come up with something _fast_, it would be his skinny neck I would wring. He spluttered, "Asuka... well, she n-needed... no, wanted to show—"  
"我的目光飘向了真嗣，他开始结结巴巴地试图拖延时间。我给他的眼神表明，如果他不赶快想出点什么，我就会扭断他那瘦弱的脖子。他结巴着说：“明日香……呃，她需要……不，她想展示——””

_C'mon, think! 快点，动动脑子！_

"—show show... show you this!" I snatched the flyer out of Shinji's hand and thrust it at Misato. Our guardian raised an eyebrow at my abnormally loud voice. I dropped it down a few decibels, cursing myself. "We've... we've got a field trip tomorrow... and... and... and we need your signature on the bottom!"  
“—给你看这个！”我从真嗣手里抢过传单，塞到美里面前。我们的监护人对我异常响亮的声音挑了挑眉。我降低了几个分贝，暗自咒骂自己。“我们…我们明天有个实地考察…而且…而且…我们需要你在下面签字！”

_Lame, Asuka. Really lame.  
真逊，明日香。真的很逊。_

Misato examined the paper after questions of my sanity pooled in her eyes. "There isn't a line for me to sign on," she finally said. Her eyes narrowed.  
美里在我眼中质疑我的理智后，仔细检查了那张纸。“这里没有让我签字的地方，”她终于说道。她的眼睛眯了起来。

"Well... um... the teacher said we had to get a signature!" I nudged Shinji with my elbow, and he started nodding his head. "Yeah. So sign it."  
“呃...老师说我们必须得拿到签名！”我用胳膊肘捅了捅真嗣，他开始点头。“对，所以签个名吧。”

Her eyes narrowed even further.  
她的眼睛眯得更细了。

Dammit. I thought there was a signature involved. At my old school, the staff wouldn't let you go anywhere unless you had permission from your guardians. Liability and whatnot.  
该死。我以为需要签名呢。在我以前的学校，没有监护人的许可，老师是不会让你去任何地方的。责任问题之类的。

"You guys aren't just saying this to get my signature right?"  
"你们这么说不是只为了让我签字吧？"

I quirked an eyebrow. "Why would we want to do that?"  
我挑了挑眉。“我们为什么要那么做？”

"In case you want to get in my bank account."  
"万一你想进我的银行账户呢。"

_What?_

Shinji turned around with a confused look. "Why would we want to do that?"  
真嗣转过身来，一脸困惑。“我们为什么要那么做？”

"It's empty, Misato," I said dryly. "If I was going to go through all that trouble, I'd choose a person who—"  
“这里空空如也，美里，”我干巴巴地说，“如果我要费那么大劲，我会选择一个——”

"Atta girl. I was just kidding, anyways." Our guardian grinned, took a pen from the table, and scratched her name onto the front of the flyer. She sighed and pulled off her shoes. "Um... if anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom." Misato then started removing clothing before she even _got_ to the shower, dropping her blouse to the ground before sighing again and closing the door.  
“好样的，女孩。我只是在开玩笑，反正。”我们的监护人咧嘴一笑，从桌上拿起一支笔，在传单正面签上了她的名字。她叹了口气，脱下鞋子。“嗯……如果有人需要我，我会在浴室里。”美里开始在还没走到淋浴间之前就脱衣服，将她的衬衫扔到地上，再次叹了口气，然后关上了门。

We sat there and stared after her. When I looked down at Shinji, I found him strangely unaffected by the encounter. Most men would have rivers of blood gushing out of their nose. "No decency whatsoever." I commented. "That's just sick."  
我们坐在那里，目送她离去。当我低头看向真嗣时，发现他对这次遭遇出奇地无动于衷。大多数男人恐怕早已鼻血直流。“一点廉耻都没有。”我评论道。“真是病态。”

"Maybe she had a bad day."  
“也许她今天心情不好。”

"Whatever..." I flipped the paper over again. "Back to work. You've got this. Now, the pen. It doesn't really matter, any pen will do. But remember, blotches and spots are sloppy. You'll get a date if the pen is scented, and she's in the bag if you do it the old fashioned way."  
“管他呢……”我又翻了一页报纸。“继续工作。你能行的。现在，拿起笔。其实无所谓，任何笔都行。但记住，墨迹和污点显得邋遢。如果笔有香味，你就能约到她；如果用老式方法，她就是你的囊中之物了。”

"Old fashioned way?" "老派方式？"

I smiled, almost conspiratorially. "Calligraphy."  
我微笑着，几乎带着点密谋的意味。“书法。”

At the mention of that word, Shinji paled. Yes, I knew how hard it is to write those characters, but it really showed that the sender of the letter cared. Also, attention to detail is critical when writing to females. "Asuka, I don't know if this is such a good idea."  
一提到这个词，真嗣的脸色就白了。是的，我知道写这些字有多难，但这确实表明了写信人的用心。而且，给女性写信时，细节至关重要。“明日香，我不知道这是不是一个好主意。”

"Of course it's a good idea!" Did he _dare doubt me? A female? I pounded my fist on the table and effectively shut his mouth. "Every guy in love is a blubbering idiot, and they've got to learn how to do it right, dammit! You're a blubbering idiot even when you're _not_ in love, so you need all the help you can get. Got it?"_  
"当然是个好主意！" 他竟敢怀疑我？一个女人？我一拳砸在桌上，成功让他闭嘴。"每个恋爱中的男人都是个哭哭啼啼的白痴，他们得学会怎么做，该死的！你就算不在恋爱中也是个哭哭啼啼的白痴，所以你需要尽可能多的帮助。明白了吗？"

_

He nodded his head quickly. "G-Got it."  
他迅速点头。"明...明白了。"

"Good. Now, the body of the message... you know the salutation? Ignore that. Most guys writing it look like dumbasses, and it really isn't needed. We like to get straight to the good part: the message. Do you understand all this?"  
"很好。现在，信息的主体部分...你知道问候语吧？忽略那个。大多数写信的男人看起来像傻瓜，而且真的不需要。我们喜欢直奔主题：信息本身。这些你都明白吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

He didn't sound so sure of himself, but I had to continue. "The message is quite simple. This is where you write poetry."  
他的语气并不十分肯定，但我必须继续。“这个信息很简单。这就是你写诗的地方。”

"Poetry?" “诗？”

I nodded. "Poetry. C'mon Third, if you just wrote down something childish like "I lurv you lots n' lots", it's a waste of stationary. You'll run home crying to your SDAT because it's the only loving you'll _ever_ get. Even an attempt at poetry is better than nothing at all. If anything, the girl will think it's adorable you tried. But if you do it right, she'll be falling all over you. That's how important it is."  
我点点头。“诗。来吧，Third，如果你只是写下像‘我非常非常爱你’这样幼稚的东西，那简直是浪费纸张。你会哭着跑回家找你的 SDAT，因为那是你唯一能得到的关爱。哪怕只是尝试写诗，也比什么都不做强。如果有什么的话，女孩会认为你尝试写诗很可爱。但如果你做得对，她会为你倾倒。这就是它有多重要。”

We both gazed at the flyer, awestruck by the power. Or maybe, Shinji was just lost and I was impatient.  
我们俩都凝视着那张传单，被其力量所震撼。或许，真嗣只是迷失了，而我则是不耐烦了。

"It's not going to get up and dance, if that's what you're thinking."  
“它不会自己站起来跳舞的，如果你是这么想的。”

He snapped out of his thoughts and apologized. "Sorry. I just... I can't write a poem."  
他回过神来，连忙道歉。“对不起。我只是……我写不出诗来。”

"Sure you can." I nudged his shoulder. "Just think of the girl you like. What do you want to say to her? What is something you share with her? How much do you love her? Why? Talk about her looks, that's always a plus. Her red hair shining, the way her cute mouth pouts, how smart she is, how she is the most beautiful girl in Tokyo-3..."  
“当然可以。”我轻推了一下他的肩膀。“想象一下你喜欢的女孩。你想对她说什么？你们有什么共同点？你有多爱她？为什么？谈谈她的外貌，这总是加分项。她那闪耀的红发，她那可爱的嘴巴噘起的模样，她有多聪明，她是第三新东京市最美丽的女孩……”

Shinji stared at me. "So... I'm supposed to be writing a poem to you?"  
真嗣盯着我。“所以……我应该给你写一首诗？”

That statement took a couple of moments to register, but when it finally did sink in, I shot up from my stool. It tipped over and clattered to the linoleum. "What?! What did you say?"  
这句话花了几秒钟才反应过来，但当我终于理解时，我从凳子上猛地站了起来。凳子翻倒，哐啷一声摔在油毡地板上。“什么？！你说什么？”

The boy stammered to explain, and he'd better be coming up with an explanation _fast_. "I-I mean... you started t-talking about red hair, and I thought... I thought you wanted me to write about you. You're the only... you know. Red hair..."  
"男孩结结巴巴地解释着，他最好能快点想出个说法。“我、我的意思是……你开始谈论红发，我以为……我以为你想让我写关于你的事。你是唯一……你知道的。红发……””

It was my turn to stammer something. Actually, I went off onto that tangent because I was envisioning _Kaji_ writing a love letter to me. Shinji ain't no Kaji, but it would be nice to get a love letter done the right way for once...  
"轮到我结巴了。其实，我之所以扯到那个话题，是因为我在想象加持给我写情书。真嗣不是加持，但能有一次正确地收到情书也不错……”

"Yeah, that was part of my plan." I said haughtily, hoping he didn't catch the waver in my voice. "Since I know you don't like anyone, what better person to practice on than me? I'm beautiful, smart, sexy, an Eva pilot..."  
"“是啊，那是我计划的一部分。”我傲慢地说，希望他没注意到我声音中的颤抖。“既然我知道你不喜欢任何人，那还有谁比我更适合练习呢？我美丽、聪明、性感，还是 Eva 驾驶员……””

A blast of hot steam on my neck cut off my self-praise. "I'm done," Misato announced.  
一股热蒸汽喷在我的脖子上，打断了我对自己的夸赞。“我完成了。”美里宣布道。

_Whoa, that was quick... 哇，真快啊..._

Instead of helping Shinji on the fine-tuning, I decided that he needed time to write the poem on his own. It certainly isn't something I can watch him do, because everyone has their own way of doing it. "I'm going in _first_. _You_ keep on working."  
我没有帮真嗣进行微调，而是决定让他自己花时间写诗。这确实不是我能看着他做的事情，因为每个人都有自己的方式。“我先进去了。你继续工作。”

"Um... okay." “呃...好吧。”

Misato, who was toweling her hair, gave me a curious look as I brushed past. I rolled my eyes and shut the bathroom door. Once safely inside, I put my elbows on the sink, cradled my head in my hands, and stared at the drain. "Why am I doing this?"  
正在用毛巾擦头发的美里好奇地看了我一眼，我匆匆走过。我翻了个白眼，关上了浴室的门。一进到里面，我就把胳膊肘撑在洗手台上，双手托着头，盯着排水口。“我为什么要这么做？”

Outside, I heard Misato closing the door to her own room. After that, silence. Shinji most likely had his headphones in his ears, Vivaldi's "Autumn Concerto" humming away inside his brain. He'd stop every once in a while and chew on the middle of his pen when inspiration ran dry. Yes, the _middle_ of the pen, not the end like most people. Once struck with a good idea, he'd put it back to paper and write again.  
外面，我听到美里关上了她自己房间的门。之后，一片寂静。真嗣多半正戴着耳机，脑中回响着维瓦尔第的《秋日协奏曲》。他时不时会停下来，咬着笔杆中间，当灵感枯竭时。是的，是笔杆中间，而不是像大多数人那样咬笔尾。一旦有了好点子，他就会把它写回纸上，继续创作。

I knew his every move.  
我熟知他的一举一动。

I'm glad he didn't question my judgment when I told him that handwritten was the way to go. Nowadays, everything is done by computer, and various fonts can be made to look like the prettiest calligraphy. But handwritten letters are always best. It just isn't the same printed out.  
我很高兴他没质疑我的判断，当我告诉他手写才是最佳选择时。如今，一切都由电脑完成，各种字体都能被设计得如同最精美的书法。但手写信件始终是最好的。打印出来的总归不一样。

I started the ritual of undressing myself, neural plugs always first to come off. Left, then right. After those were free, I turned my head from side to side. I need a haircut.  
我开始进行脱衣的仪式，神经插头总是最先取下。先是左边，然后右边。取下这些后，我左右转了转头。我需要剪头发了。

Someone knocked on the door. "Asuka?"  
有人敲了门。“明日香？”

I did what came most naturally and screamed. "You're trying to peek, you pervert! Stop jiggling the doorknob!"  
我本能地尖叫起来。“你想偷看，变态！别再摇门把手了！”

"I'm not jiggling the doorknob!"  
“我没有摇门把手！”

"Yes you are!" I ranted on about how he always tries to catch glimpses of my naked body, and when I get out what kind of torture I'd inflict on him...  
“你就是！”我继续抱怨他总是试图偷看我的裸体，以及当我想到要对他施加什么样的折磨时……

Never mind I was still fully clothed.  
别提我当时还穿着衣服。

I finally wound down. "What do you want, stupid Shinji?"  
我终于平静下来。“你到底想要什么，愚蠢的 Shinji？”

Faint scratching. "I'm done with the poem. What should I do now?"  
微弱的刮擦声。“我写完这首诗了。现在该做什么？”

I pulled my shirt off over my head and waved it at the door, trusting that he wouldn't barge in. "Close it with something. Something cheesy."  
我脱下衬衫，在头顶挥舞着，相信他不会贸然闯入。“用点俗套的话结尾吧。”

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"I dunno... a sentence or two afterwards about... well, anything."  
“我不知道……后面加一两句关于……嗯，随便什么的话。”

He didn't answer me after this, so I knew that he must have gone back to the kitchen. Ah well. Maybe he gave up. I showered, dried off, and stepped outside. No sign of Shinji or Misato, but the television was blaring in the adjacent room. If I didn't already know Shinji didn't like TV., that's where I would have guessed he would be.  
他这次没有回答我，所以我猜他一定是回厨房去了。唉，也许他放弃了。我洗了个澡，擦干身体，然后走了出去。真嗣和美里都不见踪影，但隔壁房间的电视却大声播放着。如果不是早就知道真嗣不喜欢看电视，我可能会猜他就在那里。

Walking into my room, I flipped on the light while rubbing my hair. The whole room was meticulously clean except for a single chair out of place. That chair was sitting in the middle of the floor. I walked closer, and found the flyer. "On Growing Roses...," it said on the front. I turned it over.  
走进我的房间，我一边擦着头发一边开了灯。整个房间都井井有条，只有一把椅子放错了位置。那把椅子就放在地板中央。我走近一看，发现了那张传单。"关于种植玫瑰..."，正面写着。我翻过来看了看。

|August 3, 2016 2016 年 8 月 3 日<br><br>Miss Sohryu Asuka Langley...  <br>草薙素子·明日香·兰格雷小姐...|

I shook my head. We could work on salutations later. I could tell that he was having a difficult time with that one; there were numerous scribblings and erasings around that area. Old fashioned for sure, he even included the date and the "miss" before my name.  
我摇了摇头。称呼问题可以稍后再议。我能看出他在这一点上颇为困扰；那部分周围满是涂改和擦除的痕迹。确实很老派，他甚至把日期和“小姐”二字都写上了。

I liked it. Shows the guy actually had respect for us instead of thinking that we were just an easy way to sex. Or whatever in the world they were after. I deemed the first impression "good". Would have preferred it to be neater, but that was just me being extremely picky.  
我喜欢这样。这说明他确实对我们抱有敬意，而不是把我们当成随便就能上床的对象。或是他们追求的其他什么东西。我对第一印象评价为“良好”。虽然我更希望字迹能整洁些，但这只是我过于挑剔罢了。

"Nice." “不错。”

Not wanting to read the poem in between just yet, I forced myself to skip to the ending. A little known secret is that women always save the best for last, despite what I said earlier about getting to the good part first. My heart pounded.  
不想中途读那首诗，我强迫自己直接跳到结尾。一个鲜为人知的秘密是，尽管我之前说过要先看精彩部分，但女性总是把最好的留到最后。我的心跳加速。

|   |
|---|
|Zum Stern der meine Nacht beleuchtet,  <br>向那照亮我黑夜的星辰，  <br>Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣|

An ending in German? "To the star that lights up my night?" I wrinkled my nose. What kind of a way was that to end a letter? "This better have something to do with your poem, you're losing points here Third."  
德语的结尾？“致照亮我夜晚的星星？”我皱了皱鼻子。这种结尾方式算什么？“这最好和你那首诗有关，你在这里要扣分了，第三。”

But... where would he learn the German? And why?  
但是...他会在哪里学德语？又为什么要学呢？

I shook my head and dismissed it as a fluke. It was thoughtful, that's for sure, but without knowing what it tied in with... ah well. Now it was time for the poem. I made myself put the flyer down for a moment. It must have had something to do with stars; otherwise that ending wouldn't make much sense. Could it be possible allusion to when we went stargazing together during synchronization?  
我摇了摇头，将其归为偶然。这确实很体贴，但如果不了解它与什么相关联...唉，算了。现在该是读诗的时候了。我让自己暂时放下传单。它肯定与星星有关；否则那个结尾就没什么意义了。会不会是指我们同步时一起观星的那次？

I took a deep breath.  
我深吸了一口气。

|   |

|**A Special Star 一颗特别的星**<br><br>**I** stared up into the heavens  <br>我仰望苍穹  <br>**L**ooking for a special star;  <br>寻找一颗特别的星；  <br>**O**ne caught my eye: I grabbed it -  <br>一颗星吸引了我的目光：我抓住了它——  <br>**V**ery closely, I put it to my heart;  <br>我紧紧地将它贴近心口；  <br>**E**ndlessly, it shined so bright -  <br>无止境地，它闪耀得如此明亮——  <br>**Y**oung and pulsating, its brightness grew  <br>年轻而充满活力，它的光芒愈发璀璨  <br>**O**ne day, I finally understood -  <br>有一天，我终于明白了——  <br>**U**nderstood that this star was my love for you.  <br>明白了这颗星是我对你的爱。<br><br>There really isn't anything else to say.

...

God help the lucky girl who gets Shinji's next love letter.  
愿上帝保佑那个幸运的女孩，她将收到真嗣的下一份情书。

*****

"No, honestly, how did you do it?"  
“不，说真的，你是怎么做到的？”

"Um... I... um..." “呃...我...呃...”

I couldn't get a damn wink of sleep last night, trying to solve the riddle known as Ikari Shinji. The social outcast Ikari Shinji? Self-proclaimed extreme introvert Ikari Shinji? Love letter writer extraordinaire Ikari Shinji?  
昨晚我他妈的连眼都没合上，试图解开那个被称为碇真嗣的谜题。那个社交边缘人碇真嗣？自称极端内向者的碇真嗣？情书高手碇真嗣？

It didn't make sense.  
这说不通。

Misato turned around in her seat and waved at me, all while driving at speeds of over 75 MPH. "I thought it was cute."  
美里在座位上转过身来向我挥手，同时以超过 75 英里每小时的速度驾驶。"我觉得挺可爱的。"

The boy beside me flushed. "It wasn't that good..."  
我身边的男孩脸红了。“没那么好……”

No no no. This wasn't _possible_. He _had_ to copy that poem from somewhere. Internet? One of Misato's corny romance novels? He sure as hell couldn't have written it himself. It was too... good.  
不不不。这不可能。他一定是抄了哪里的诗。互联网？美里那些俗气的言情小说之一？他绝对不可能自己写出来的。那诗太……好了。

I crossed my arms. "Not bad, but not great either. You still need a lot of work."  
我交叉双臂。“不错，但也没到极好。你还有很多需要改进的地方。”

Thank God I'm much better at lying than I am at telling the truth. At my critique, Shinji relaxed and slumped. "I... yeah."  
谢天谢地，我撒谎的本事比说实话强多了。听到我的批评，真嗣放松下来，瘫坐在那里。“我……嗯。”

He's more at ease when people put him down than when people praise him. What a weirdo.  
他被人贬低时比被人夸奖时更自在。真是个怪人。

Misato skidded to a halt and announced that we were here. I pulled Shinji's poem out of my pocket and read the front. "Is this the place?" It appeared to be more of a construction site than anything else. Yellow forklifts, bulldozers, and other heavy machinery blocked my view out the window.  
美里突然停下脚步，宣布我们到了。我从口袋里掏出真嗣的诗，看了看封面。“是这里吗？”看起来更像是个建筑工地，而不是别的什么地方。黄色的叉车、推土机和其他重型机械挡住了我望向窗外的视线。

"It says that... well..."  
"上面写着...呃..."

Someone tapped on the glass from the outside; I looked up and saw Hikari smiling at me. "Never mind," I said. I folded the paper back up and shoved it in my schoolbag. Why I chose to bring that stupid letter was beyond me. And why I also brought my schoolbag...  
有人从外面轻敲了下玻璃；我抬头一看，是光在对我微笑。“没关系，”我说。我把纸重新折好，塞回书包。我为什么要带那封愚蠢的信，我自己也搞不懂。还有，我为什么要带上书包...

It was eight in the morning. Give me a break.  
才早上八点。饶了我吧。

"I'll just pick you up at three, okay?"  
"我三点钟来接你，好吗？"

Shinji got out of the car, followed by me. "Okay."  
真嗣下了车，我跟在后面。“好的。”

I slammed the door and started to walk away, but she rolled down her car window to talk more. I leaned in closer while she grinned, "By the way Asuka, you look very nice in those dungarees. Very American."  
我用力关上车门，开始走开，但她摇下车窗想继续说话。我靠近了些，她笑着说：“顺便说一句，明日香，你穿那条背带裤很好看。非常有美国范儿。”

"Shut up Misato," I growled uncharitably. You can't wear a school uniform to something like this! And since this horrid denim outfit was the only old clothes I had...  
"闭嘴，美里，"我不客气地低吼道。你不能穿校服来参加这种活动！而且这件糟糕的牛仔装是我仅有的旧衣服了……

Hikari smiled at me after Misato roared down the street. She wore a t-shirt with blue paint splatters on the shoulders. I couldn't even see her shorts, the shirt being so oversized. "It's about time you showed up. Did you bring your flyer?"  
美里在街上大吼大叫后，光对我笑了笑。她穿着一件 T 恤，肩部有蓝色油漆的斑点。我甚至看不到她的短裤，因为那件 T 恤太大了。"你终于来了。你带传单了吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

The park wasn't a disaster area like I had first imagined. Shallow ruts from bulldozers speckled the otherwise flat area, but I didn't see any rubble. When I asked Hikari about this, she explained that they had cleared it yesterday so the "beautification" could start. I snorted, and then asked her where our teacher was. She said he was wandering around here somewhere.  
公园并不像我最初想象的那样是一片废墟。推土机留下的浅沟在平坦的地面上零星分布，但我没看到任何碎石。当我向光询问此事时，她解释说他们昨天已经清理过了，以便"美化"工作可以开始。我嗤之以鼻，然后问她我们的老师在哪里。她说他就在这附近某个地方闲逛。

I snorted again. 我又哼了一声。

We walked over to where the rest of our class was gathered, and I made especially sure to stay as far away from Shinji as I could. The boy's presence made me uncomfortable, especially since I couldn't figure him out. I chatted idly with Hikari and another girl named Mayuka until the teacher shuffled up to our little group. He started, "We need partners during this project—"  
我们走到班上其他同学聚集的地方，我特别注意尽量远离真嗣。那个男孩的存在让我感到不安，尤其是我无法看透他。我闲聊着和光以及其他名叫美由香的女孩子聊天，直到老师向我们这小群人走来。他开口道：“这次项目我们需要搭档——”

"I call Hikari!" I cut in.  
“我要和光一组！”我插话道。

The man narrowed his eyes. "They've already been assigned, Miss Langley."  
男子眯起了眼睛。“他们已经被分配好了，兰利小姐。”

_Damn._

He pointed to Hikari as I crossed my arms in defiance. "You will be paired with Touji Suzuhara."  
他指向光，而我交叉双臂表示抗拒。“你将与铃原东治搭档。”

I couldn't help but snicker. At least I didn't get the worst of them all. Can you just imagine? That hulking brute tenderly caring for flowers? Hikari didn't seem thrilled with the suggestion either, but she obediently followed orders.  
我忍不住轻笑出声。至少我没摊上最糟糕的那个。你能想象吗？那个魁梧的野兽温柔地照料花朵？光似乎也对这一安排不甚满意，但她还是顺从地听从了命令。

"Mayuka has Aida Kensuke..."  
"真由香有相田健介..."

"Who do I have?"  
"我有谁呢？"

The man ran an arthritic finger down his list, and I confidently turned around to survey the landscape.  
那人用患有关节炎的手指沿着名单下滑，我自信地转过身来审视四周的景象。

That's when it hit me.  
就在那时，我恍然大悟。

All the blood pulsed out of my face and drained to my feet. Everyone had a partner already except for one boy drawing circles in the ground at his feet.  
所有的血液仿佛都从我的脸上涌出，汇聚到脚底。除了一个在地上画圈的男孩，其他人都已经有了舞伴。

Please God, anyone but...  
求求上帝，千万别是……

"Ikari Shinji." "碇真嗣。"

I noted with annoyance that God _never_ listens to me.  
我恼怒地注意到，上帝从不听我的。

Figures. 果然。

Once Shinji got the hand shovels, we were ushered to our designated corner of the park. The whole place was drier than the Sahara . I looked at the rosebush I was carrying and questioned if it would live. Getting no answer from the roses (I wasn't expecting one), I asked my teacher where the compost was. "You can't expect these things to grow without compost," I explained.  
一旦真嗣拿到了手铲，我们就被引到了公园指定的角落。整个地方比撒哈拉沙漠还要干燥。我看着手中的玫瑰丛，怀疑它是否能存活。玫瑰没有给我任何答案（我也没指望它们会回答），于是我问老师堆肥在哪里。“没有堆肥，你不能指望这些东西能生长，”我解释道。

He only gave me a lopsided grin and said quietly, "Oh, you'll see. It's a surprise."  
他只是歪嘴一笑，轻声说道：“哦，你会看到的。这是个惊喜。”

I never, _ever_, want to see that kind of smile from a teacher again.  
我再也不想从老师那里看到那种笑容了。

While walking back to our area, I saw Shinji sitting cross-legged on the ground looking at the potted roses beside him. Every once in a while, he would blink his eyes and keep them closed for a fraction of a second longer than normal.  
在走回我们区域的途中，我看到真嗣盘腿坐在地上，目光落在身旁的花盆玫瑰上。他不时地眨眼，闭眼的时间比平时稍长几分之一秒。

"Enjoying the view, idiot?"  
“欣赏风景呢，傻瓜？”

Shinji snapped his head around and gave me a slight glare. "You don't have to call me that, you know."  
真嗣猛地转过头，给了我一个轻微的白眼。“你没必要这么叫我，你知道的。”

"Yeah**,** whatever." I knelt down beside him and picked up a small spade. Everyone was already hard at work digging the holes to put their roses into. Touji and Hikari were actually working pretty well together, and their dirt mound was the biggest so far.  
“嗯，随便吧。”我跪在他旁边，拿起一把小铲子。大家已经开始卖力地挖坑准备种玫瑰了。东治和光一起干得挺不错，他们堆的土堆是目前最大的。

Shinji moved into position and pointed at a giant orange "X" on the ground. "Here, right?"  
真嗣走到指定位置，指着地上一个巨大的橙色“X”标记问：“这里，对吧？”

"_Obviously_." I stabbed at the "X" with my spade to loosen the dirt... and found that it was solid as rock. I looked at Shinji with a disbelieving eye and stabbed it again. Solid chunks of dirt chipped off. I started ramming it into the ground repeatedly. "What the hell is the matter with this!"  
“显然是。”我用铲子戳了戳那个“X”试图松土……却发现地面硬得像石头。我难以置信地看了真嗣一眼，又戳了一下。坚硬的土块掉了下来。我开始反复猛击地面。“这他妈是怎么回事！”

"Need help, Devil Woman?"  
"需要帮忙吗，恶魔女？"

"Not from you, idiot." I snarled at Touji before ordering Shinji to help me. "Don't just sit there, dig!"  
"不需要你，白痴。"" 我对冬二咆哮道，然后命令真嗣来帮我。""别光坐着，挖啊！"

How ridiculous we must have looked, two powerful Evangelion pilots vainly attempting to loosen packed dirt. As for the other pilot... Ayanami Rei wasn't in sight.  
我们看起来一定很可笑，两个强大的 EVA 驾驶员徒劳地试图松动坚实的泥土。至于另一位驾驶员……绫波零不见踪影。

"Probably... skipped... school... again..." Each syllable was enunciated by a hard thrust. To my satisfaction, the tough earth was only existent in the first two inches. Once Shinji and I carved away a two-foot area, our desperate hacking slowed. Good thing too, because my wrists were starting to hurt. "Where exactly is Wondergirl, anyways?"  
"大概...又...逃学了..." 每个音节都伴随着一次有力的挺进。令我满意的是，坚硬的土地仅存在于最初的两英寸。一旦我和真嗣挖开了一个两英尺的区域，我们绝望的劈砍就放缓了。还好，因为我的手腕开始疼了。"话说，绫波到底在哪里？"

Shinji shrugged, and started a more even pace of shoveling. "Maybe she was sick today."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，开始以更均匀的节奏铲土。"也许她今天生病了。"

_Could be. 有可能。_

Seeing how he could handle the work, I leaned back on my knees and felt the displaced dirt. The layer beneath was slightly wetter than the one on top. It had a very smooth, non-gritty feeling to it. Clay. Shinji didn't seem to mind me stopping, and I think it was understood that we should work in turns.  
看到他能应付工作，我便跪坐下来，感受着被翻动的泥土。下层比表层略微湿润，触感非常平滑，没有沙粒感。是黏土。真嗣似乎并不介意我停下来，我想我们都明白应该轮流工作。

He can take the longer shifts, of course.  
当然，他可以承担更长时间的轮班。

Just for idle chitchat, I motioned over to where Hikari and Touji were digging. "Their roses aren't as big as ours."  
只是闲聊，我指了指光和阿薰正在挖掘的地方。"他们的玫瑰没有我们的那么大。"

Shinji paused, gave me a strange look, and started digging again. "Their roses aren't as pretty, either."  
真嗣停顿了一下，给了我一个奇怪的眼神，然后又开始挖掘。“他们的玫瑰也没那么漂亮。”

"Are you joking? I'd rather have their red roses than these yellow ones." I touched a rose, gently enough so it would not be bruised. "They're... nicer."  
“你在开玩笑吗？我宁愿要他们的红玫瑰，也不要这些黄色的。”我轻轻触摸了一朵玫瑰，以免弄伤它。“它们……更美。”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

I stopped. Why was I saying this? It made me sound like a huge softie for flowers, and that's not the kind of image I want to convey. He kept on digging, and I changed the direction of the conversation to something that didn't make me feel uneasy. "Oh look, there's a tag in the pot."  
我停了下来。我为什么要这么说？这让我听起来像个对花儿特别温柔的人，而这并不是我想传达的形象。他继续挖掘，我改变了话题，转向一些不会让我感到不安的事情。“哦，看，花盆里有个标签。”

Shinji didn't look up. "A what?"  
真嗣没有抬头。“什么？”

"You know, the piece of plastic that says the kind of rose it is, idiot."  
“你知道的，那个塑料片上写着这是什么玫瑰，白痴。”

"Oh."

I pulled it out. It had a tiny picture of our yellow roses followed by the given name. You know, hopeless romantic rose breeders would stumble onto a new variety of rose and dub it something sappy. We had people like that all over Germany . I squinted.  
我把它抽了出来。上面有一张我们黄玫瑰的小图片，后面跟着它的名字。你知道，那些无可救药的浪漫玫瑰培育者发现新品种时，总会给它起个俗气的名字。德国到处都是这样的人。我眯起了眼睛。

Then gasped. 然后倒抽了一口气。

Class 2. Variety: "Evening Stars".  
二班。品种：“夜星”。

"Huh?" “啊？”

Growing infinitely more paranoid, I stared at that tag for a sizeable fraction of my life. My thoughts raced to the piece of paper that had been given to me the night before. More specifically, the poem. I must have read and reread that name, making sure it wasn't some trick of the light.  
我变得越来越多疑，盯着那标签看了我生命中相当长的一段时间。我的思绪飞快地回到了前一晚给我的那张纸条上。更确切地说，是那首诗。我一定反复读了那个名字，确保它不是光线造成的错觉。

"Evening Stars," I murmured.  
“Evening Stars”，我喃喃道。

I threw my hands in the air in frustration. All right. That's it! I was getting to the bottom of this silly love letter nonsense once and for all. That boy must have the greatest dumb luck of any kid I've ever met. This was just too huge of a coincidence.  
我沮丧地举起双手。好吧，就这样！我一定要彻底揭开这封愚蠢情书的真相。那小子肯定是我见过的最幸运的傻瓜。这巧合也太大了。

I tapped Shinji on the shoulder and glared at him. Well, maybe "tap" is not the correct word for it; he lost his balance and toppled over into the dirt. I looked around me to make sure no one was listening. "All right Third, how'd you do it?"  
我拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，瞪着他。也许“拍”这个词不太准确；他失去平衡，摔进了泥土里。我环顾四周，确保没人偷听。“好吧，第三，你是怎么做到的？”

"Do what?" "做什么？"

Shinji gazed at me with those annoyingly confused eyes, and that made me even madder. Didn't he have any _clue_? I've lost so much time thinking about this, and all he could say is 'do what'? I leaned forward. "How'd you write that love letter?!"  
"真嗣用那双令人恼火的困惑眼神盯着我，这让我更加生气。他难道一点头绪都没有吗？我为此浪费了那么多时间，而他只会说‘做什么’？我向前倾身。“你是怎么写那封情书的？！””

"What do you mean?" He blinked, and I gasped. That's when I _knew_. Shinji wasn't playing stupid; he honestly didn't know what I was talking about.  
“你什么意思？”他眨了眨眼，我倒吸一口气。就在那时，我明白了。真嗣不是在装傻；他是真的不知道我在说什么。

_Shinji wrote it himself. 真嗣自己写的。_

If he hadn't written it, he would have gotten defensive. This simple fact left me speechless. That poem was far better than any love poem I had ever read, and the feeling behind the letter almost moved me to tears. And the sad thing was, he gave me the impression that he didn't even _try_ to make it good.  
如果他没有写下来，他可能会变得防御性十足。这个简单的事实让我无言以对。那首诗远比我读过的任何情诗都要好，信中的情感几乎让我感动落泪。而可悲的是，他给我的印象是他甚至没有努力去写好它。

I didn't speak, not really knowing what to say. My only two paths were dead ends. If I admitted it was good, that would show weakness on my part. If I said it was bad, I would be lying to myself and the conversation ends there. I wanted to hear an answer from his mouth, explaining why such a boring boy can turn out such a fantastic letter.  
我没有说话，真的不知道该说什么。我仅有的两条路都是死胡同。如果我承认它好，那会显示我的软弱。如果我说它不好，我就是在自欺欺人，对话也就此结束。我想从他嘴里听到一个解释，为什么这样一个无聊的男孩能写出如此精彩的信。

_What do you mean? 你是什么意思？_

I went for the option that would make me feel the best.  
我选择了那个能让我感觉最好的选项。

"I mean..."  “我是说……”

I bit my lip. Don't blow your cover, Asuka! Hide it under an insult! An insult! "Well... for an _amateur_, you didn't do half bad. I mean... yeah... stop looking at me like that."  
我咬了咬嘴唇。别露馅了，明日香！用侮辱掩盖过去！侮辱！“好吧……作为一个新手，你做得不算太糟。我是说……对啊……别那样看着我。”

A bright flush rose in his cheeks, and to my horror, I felt the same heat crawl into my own. Embarrassed, he resumed digging again, if you could call stabbing at the ground digging. Part of me was tempted to hit him for having such a stupid expression on his face, but the other part of me was angry that I was hesitant to do so. I chose not to storm off to the nearby Port-O-Let. No, that would be an admission of weakness. He would think I was lying to him.  
他的脸颊上泛起了一抹明显的红晕，让我惊恐的是，我也感觉到同样的燥热爬上了自己的脸。他尴尬地继续挖土，如果那能称之为挖土的话。我的一部分想要因为他脸上那愚蠢的表情揍他一顿，但另一部分却因犹豫不决而感到愤怒。我选择不去附近的移动厕所发泄。不，那会显得我软弱。他会认为我在对他撒谎。

Instead, I turned to look at the roses and decided to give him the cold shoulder. I knew that he didn't really deserve it, but it was sloppiness on my part. Sloppiness because I didn't plan out what I was going to say before I said it. I guess ignoring him was more to my benefit than to his. This way I wouldn't say anything dumb.  
相反，我转头看向玫瑰花，决定对他冷眼相待。我知道他其实并不真正配得上这种待遇，但这只是我自己的疏忽。疏忽在于我没有在开口前想好要说什么。我想，无视他对我比对他更有利。这样我就不会说出什么愚蠢的话了。

Trying to act detached, I rubbed a petal in between my fingers. Soft, almost velvety. If I pressed too hard though, a brown depression of my fingerprint appeared. Roses are so frail. Supposedly, in the language of flowers, a rose says "I love you". A dozen roses means "I love you lots", while a single rose means "romantic and mysterious". I don't know, I think a single rose is indirectly saying "I'm a cheapskate".  
我试图装作漠不关心，用手指揉搓着一片花瓣。柔软，几乎如天鹅绒般。但如果我用力过猛，指纹的棕色凹陷就会出现。玫瑰如此脆弱。据说，在花语中，玫瑰代表“我爱你”。一打玫瑰意味着“我非常爱你”，而一朵玫瑰则意味着“浪漫而神秘”。我不确定，我觉得一朵玫瑰间接地表示“我是个吝啬鬼”。

But in all seriousness... roses wither, blacken, and die. Why would anyone use it as a declaration of love? Doesn't matter how vibrant the color is, it still dies. Even white roses turn black.  
但说真的……玫瑰会凋谢、变黑、死去。为什么有人会用它来表达爱意呢？无论颜色多么鲜艳，它终究会凋谢。即使是白玫瑰也会变黑。

Kaji once told me that all the colors meant different things. He came to my dorm and looked around before he went back to Germany . He said red meant passion. That was the most frequent color I found waiting for me in my college dorm, no doubt from my posse of horny college boys. They must have had a Lolita complex, considering I was only 13 at the time. I got a couple of white roses, and Kaji said those meant purity. I don't know why the hell guys gave me _those_.  
卡吉曾告诉我，所有颜色都有不同的含义。他来到我的宿舍，环顾四周，然后返回德国。他说红色代表激情。这是我大学宿舍里最常见的颜色，毫无疑问来自我那群好色的大学男生。考虑到我当时只有 13 岁，他们肯定有恋童癖。我收到了几朵白玫瑰，卡吉说那代表纯洁。我不知道为什么那些男生会送我这些。

Our roses were yellow.  
我们的玫瑰是黄色的。

I scanned all around me. Reds, whites, a couple of corals, even pinks, but Shinji and I had the only one with yellow flowers.  
我环顾四周，红的、白的、几株珊瑚色的，甚至还有粉色的，但只有我和真嗣拥有这唯一一株开黄色花朵的玫瑰。

I never got yellow roses. What does that color mean?  
我从未收到过黄玫瑰。这个颜色代表什么意思呢？

"Hey Shinji—" "嘿，真嗣——"

"Hey Asuka—" "嘿，明日香——"

...

_What? Still synched? 什么？还在同步吗？_

We just stared at each other, not really sure what to make of that. It broke the silence so quickly, and so unexpectedly. That made for a very awkward situation, especially since Hikari and Touji strolled by at the _moment_ it was said.  
我们只是互相凝视着对方，不太确定该如何理解这一刻。它打破了沉默，如此迅速，又如此出乎意料。这造成了一个非常尴尬的局面，尤其是当 Hikari 和 Touji 恰好在那时走过。

"Say... what are you doing?"  
“说...你在做什么？”

Shinji face flared, but I couldn't find it in myself to tear my eyes away. Why? I... I guess I don't really know. We probably would have kept staring at each other if I hadn't realized a depressingly simple fact. If Shinji's face was red, I'd hate to see what color mine was.  
Shinji 的脸颊泛红，但我无法让自己移开视线。为什么？我...我想我并不真的知道。如果我们没有意识到一个令人沮丧的简单事实，我们可能会一直这样对视下去。如果 Shinji 的脸都红了，我真不敢想象自己的脸是什么颜色。

"Um... Asuka?" Hikari said tentatively. "Are you finished?"  
"嗯... 明日香？" 光小心翼翼地问道。"你完成了吗？"

Shinji was the one who answered. "We're finished... digging I mean." As if this was discomforting to him, Shinji started to blush again. I regained my dignity and stared up at the two looming over us. Hikari had a decidedly worried look in her eyes while Touji... well, he wasn't looking at me.  
回答的是真嗣。"我们挖完了... 我是说挖坑。" 似乎这对他来说很不自在，真嗣又开始脸红。我恢复了尊严，抬头看着站在我们面前的两人。光的眼神明显带着担忧，而阿薰... 好吧，他没有看我。

"Don't you guys have to put that in the ground first? You can look at each other all you want later."  
"你们不是得先把那东西埋进土里吗？之后你们想怎么看对方都行。"

Touji's tone made my blood boil. Thankfully, I didn't have to resort to violence. Hikari did it for me. "Why can't you keep your big mouth _shut_?" the class rep demanded. She dragged him away by his ear towards the podium, where everyone was gathering.  
冬二那语气让我火冒三丈。幸好我没必要诉诸暴力，光替我出手了。“你就不能闭上你那张大嘴吗？”班长厉声质问。她拽着他的耳朵，把他拖向讲台，大家都聚集在那里。

The others had already finished their planting, their roses standing tall in the hard soil. One hole wasn't deep enough for a bush of lavender flowers, and it was leaning at a 45-degree angle. The two students assigned to that one sprinted over and saved it before it slumped to the ground.  
其他人已经完成了种植，他们的玫瑰在坚硬的土壤中挺立。有一个坑不够深，种下的薰衣草花丛倾斜了 45 度。负责那块地的两名学生飞奔过去，在它倒地之前救了起来。

Not wanting to make myself appear lazy, I took a small shovel of dirt out of the hole and let it drop on top of the mound beside it. It looked deep enough to me.  
不想显得自己懒惰，我从小坑里铲了一小铲土，让它落在旁边的土堆上。在我看来，这已经够深了。

"I guess we're supposed to put this in," Shinji said quietly.  
"我想我们应该把这个放进去，" 真嗣轻声说道。

"I guess." "大概是吧。

I was analyzing how to take the damn thorny bush out of the pot when Hikari came back with a beat up, rusty watering can in her hands. She said, "One of you is supposed to get the water, and the other one..." she pointed to a gathering of students, "... is supposed to go over there for a special surprise."  
我正在琢磨怎么把那该死的带刺灌木丛从盆里弄出来，这时光里拿着一个破旧生锈的喷壶回来了。她说："你们中一个得去打水，另一个..." 她指向一群学生， "...得去那边领个特别的惊喜。

Hikari actually sounded excited about it. A special surprise? I rolled my eyes, "Gee Shinji, it's an awfully tough choice for me. What do _you_ want to do?"  
光希听起来真的很兴奋。特别的惊喜？我翻了个白眼，“哎呀真嗣，对我来说这选择可真是难上加难。你想做什么？”

He paused. "Are you sure you want me to choose, Asuka?"  
他顿了顿。“你确定要我选吗，明日香？”

I rocked back on my knees and stood up. Contemptuously brushing dirt off my thighs, I sighed. "Whatever." I forgot to add, "It's too lame to waste my time thinking about it".  
我跪着向后一靠，站了起来。轻蔑地拍掉大腿上的泥土，我叹了口气。“随便。”我忘了补充，“这种事太无聊了，不值得我浪费时间去想。”

Shinji didn't take long to ponder this. "Then... I guess I'll do the watering and the planting."  
真嗣没花多少时间思考这个问题。“那么……我想我会负责浇水和种植。”

"Fine then." Typical answer. I shouldn't have even bothered asking; I knew what his answer was going to be anyways. Shinji tried to stand, but I waved him down. "No, don't get up. I'll spare you the walk over and get your damned water. I'm going that way anyways." I whirled around and wiped my forehead with the back of my hand, not wanting to see his reaction. Stupid boy probably though I was going soft on him. In reality, I just wanted a refreshing drink.  
“好吧。”典型的回答。我根本不该费心去问；反正我也知道他会怎么回答。真嗣试图站起来，但我挥手让他坐下。“不，别起来。我会省去你走过去的麻烦，帮你拿那该死的水。反正我也要往那边去。”我转过身，用手背擦了擦额头，不想看到他的反应。这傻小子大概以为我对他心软了。实际上，我只是想要一杯清凉的饮料。

_Ugh. This is so... stupid.  
呃。这真是……太蠢了。_

When I trudged away, it struck me to how incredibly hot the sun was. And the jeans didn't do much for keeping me cool either. The ground seemed to shift right before my eyes.  
当我拖着沉重的步伐离开时，我突然意识到太阳是多么的炙热。而且牛仔裤也没怎么帮我保持凉爽。地面似乎在我眼前摇晃。

_Keep it together, Asuka. Can't be passing out before the surprise.  
保持冷静，明日香。不能在惊喜之前就晕倒。_

"Oh goodie..." I mumbled. The tree-huggers and flower enthusiasts were using us for child labor. At least they had the compassion to give us water. Problem was, the water was in tiny sake sized cups and it was also lukewarm from sitting on the end of the tailgate. I downed six and didn't bother to throw the used cups in the "proper trash receptacle".  
“哦，太好了...”我咕哝着。那些热爱大自然和花卉的人把我们当成了童工。至少他们还有点同情心，给了我们水喝。问题是，水装在小小的、酒杯大小的杯子里，而且因为放在卡车尾板上，已经变得温热。我一口气喝了六杯，懒得把用过的杯子扔进“正确的垃圾桶”。

It was too hot, dammit.  
该死，天太热了。

I brought back a watering can with a daisy on the front to Shinji. Our roses were already in the ground, and he was patting down the earth around it. Resisting the urge to pour water on him took strength, but I caved in anyway. I told him that he was in my way and if he didn't want to get wet, he should move.  
我给真嗣带回了一个前面画着雏菊的洒水壶。我们的玫瑰已经种在地里，他正在给周围的土压实。忍住不往他身上浇水需要很大的毅力，但我还是没忍住。我告诉他挡我路了，如果不想被淋湿，就该挪挪地方。

Shinji didn't answer and kept on patting the ground.  
真嗣没有回答，继续拍打着地面。

"Fine, you asked for it." I tipped the can over slightly, and a bit more water than I had anticipated came out.  
“好吧，这是你自找的。”我将罐子微微倾斜，倒出的水比预想的还要多。

He yelped and whirled his head around to look at me. "What was that for?"  
他惊叫一声，猛地转过头来看着我。“你这是干什么？”

I shrugged. "I asked you to move. You didn't say anything."  
我耸了耸肩。“我让你挪开。你没吭声。”

"What? _You_ didn't say anything! You just stood there!" The entire back of his shirt was drenched.  
“什么？你什么都没说！就站在那儿！”他的衬衫后背全湿透了。

I heard someone call my name, but easily ignored it. "Eh. Whatever. It's not like it didn't feel good. Besides, you should feel honored that Sohryu Asuka Langley chose to pour water on you to alleviate your misery."  
我听到有人叫我的名字，但轻易地忽略了它。“呃，随便吧。反正感觉还不错。再说了，你应该感到荣幸，是惣流·明日香·兰格雷选择用水浇你来缓解你的痛苦。”

He narrowed his eyes at me, and we faced off. Was it a look of annoyance? Sarcasm? Either way, I pulled back a little bit. I found myself wondering why he was making such a big deal out of this, but I suppose I knew the consequences as soon as I poured the water. Was Shinji's spine coming to make a guest appearance? Would he yell at me? I would have yelled right back. Would he ignore me and continue playing in the dirt? I would have said he was spineless.  
他眯起眼睛盯着我，我们僵持着。那是恼怒的眼神？还是讽刺？不管怎样，我稍稍退缩了一点。我不禁纳闷他为何对此事如此大惊小怪，但我想我一倒水就预料到了后果。真嗣的脊梁骨要来客串一下吗？他会对我大吼吗？我会立刻回敬。他会无视我继续玩泥巴吗？我会说他没骨气。

"Miss Langley...?" “兰格利小姐...？”

_C'mon Shinji. 来吧，真嗣。_

The unexpected happened.  
意外发生了。

"Yeah, it did feel kinda good." He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. Then he _smiled_. "The—"  
"是啊，确实感觉挺不错的。" 他不好意思地揉了揉后颈。然后他笑了。"那——"

"Miss Langley!" "兰利小姐！"

"Devil Woman! Get over here!"  
"恶魔女人！快过来！"

I scowled and turned around. "I'm coming already!" I thrust the watering can at Shinji and ran to where approximately half of the students were standing. The other half were tending their roses.  
"我皱着眉头转过身。“我已经来了！”我把浇水壶塞给真嗣，跑到大约一半学生站着的地方。另一半则在照料他们的玫瑰。”

Once I got to the congregation of students, I stopped beside Touji, out of breath. He smirked at me. "You can stare at Shinji all you want later."  
"一到学生聚集的地方，我在喘着气的同时停在了阿薰旁边。他对我咧嘴一笑。“你以后可以尽情盯着真嗣看。””

I punched him on the arm, hard enough to leave a bruise. "Shut the hell up, stooge."  
"我狠狠地在他手臂上打了一拳，足以留下淤青。“闭嘴，蠢货。””

Our teacher was standing on top of the podium, waving a piece of paper like a flag. Everyone was talking all around me, and the distant jackhammers made his voice carry a grand total of two inches in front of his face. Someone shouted at everyone to keep quiet, and although it didn't have the same commanding air as say, Hikari's did, everyone gradually stopped talking.  
我们的老师站在讲台上，像挥舞旗帜一样挥动着一张纸。周围每个人都在交谈，而远处打桩机的声音让他的声音只能传到他面前两英寸的地方。有人大声要求大家安静，虽然这没有像光那样有威严，但大家逐渐停止了说话。

The man on the podium shrugged. "Uh, thank you." Injecting some happiness in his voice, he said, "Is everyone ready for the _surprise_?"  
讲台上的人耸了耸肩。"呃，谢谢。"他努力在声音中注入一些喜悦，问道："大家都准备好迎接惊喜了吗？"

Some muttering. Kensuke popped up beside me, video camera trained on our teacher. "What kind of surprise?"  
一阵低语。健介突然出现在我旁边，摄像机对准了我们的老师。"什么样的惊喜？"

I pushed the bespectacled boy further away from me; he was invading my private space. "It's probably something stupid," I declared.  
我将那个戴眼镜的男孩推得更远些；他侵入了我的私人空间。“可能是什么蠢事，”我断言道。

"For once, you and I agree on something, Devil Woman."  
“难得啊，你和我居然在某件事上意见一致，恶魔女。”

"If you don't stop calling me that, I'm going to kick you."  
“你要是再这么叫我，我可真要踢你了。”

Touji seemed unaffected.  
冬二看起来毫不在意。

"And then I'll sic Hikari on you," I added.  
“然后我就让光来对付你，”我补充道。

He rubbed his ear, no doubt remembering previous encounters with the class representative. That effectively kept his mouth shut. I smirked.  
他揉了揉耳朵，无疑想起了之前与班长的交锋。这招果然让他闭上了嘴。我得意地笑了。

It was at this point I noticed a giant green barrel being rolled onto the podium. Several able-bodied boys from our class were pushing it up the incline and placed it beside the teacher. It was bigger than any barrel I'd ever seen before. Our teacher smiled and patted the barrel as if it was a loyal pet. Most of the students took a step back as if the man had lost his mind. "Did you bring your flyers? And your partner's?"  
"就在这时，我注意到一个巨大的绿色桶被推上了讲台。我们班上几个身强力壮的男生正把它推上斜坡，放在老师旁边。这个桶比我以前见过的任何桶都要大。老师微笑着拍了拍桶，仿佛它是一只忠诚的宠物。大多数学生都后退了一步，好像那人已经失去了理智。“你们带了传单吗？还有你搭档的？””

Kensuke stopped recording long enough to pull his out of a pocket. "He's been making a huge deal about this all day."  
"健介暂停了录像，从口袋里掏出传单。“他一整天都在大肆宣扬这件事。””

"Yeah, I know." Touji snorted and unfolded his, "Mr. Sasaki is just... yeah."  
"“是啊，我知道。”斗志哼了一声，展开了他的传单，“佐佐木老师就是……嗯。””

I narrowed my eyes in suspicion. "What is this stupid thing about? Why are the flyers—"  
我眯起眼睛表示怀疑。“这愚蠢的东西到底是什么？为什么会有传单——”

Our teacher clapped his hands to get our attention. I'd never seen him look so enthusiastic about something before. If only his Second Impact lectures were delivered with the same gusto, I wouldn't be falling asleep during most of them. "Now make a single file line here in front. Have your papers ready."  
我们的老师拍手吸引我们的注意。我从未见过他对某件事如此热情。如果他的《第二次冲击》讲座也能这么充满激情，我就不至于在大部分时间里打瞌睡了。“现在在这里排成一列纵队。准备好你们的文件。”

Everyone obeyed, and this was when I started getting nervous. I didn't have Shinji's flyer, but I did have my own. It was tucked away inside my pocket. To be on the safe side, I positioned myself in the back behind Kensuke so I could see what was going on.  
所有人都服从了，这时我开始感到紧张。我没有真嗣的传单，但我有自己的。它被我藏在口袋里。为了安全起见，我站在健介后面，这样我就能看到发生了什么。

At the front of the line, I saw a shy girl named Tomoe hand two flyers to Mr. Sasaki. He smiled, took them, marked something down on a clipboard, and gave two black things to her. I couldn't see very well from this far away, but they appeared to be computer disks.  
在队伍的前端，我看到一个名叫巴的害羞女孩递给佐佐木先生两张传单。他微笑着接过，在剪贴板上做了些标记，然后给了她两个黑色物品。从这么远的地方我看得不是很清楚，但它们看起来像是电脑磁盘。

"Wait a second... isn't today report card day?"  
“等一下... 今天不是成绩单发放的日子吗？”

Kensuke nodded at Touji. "Yeah... it is."  
健介对戸二点了点头。“是啊... 没错。”

Our report cards? So soon? I did a double take as Tomoe walked by. On the front of the disks I saw her name followed by our class number. The white label confirmed that it was our grades. My eyes darted over to Mr. Sasaki again, and I caught him in the act of...  
我们的成绩单？这么快？当巴走过时，我愣了一下。在光盘正面，我看到了她的名字，后面跟着我们的班级编号。白色标签证实了这就是我们的成绩。我的目光再次投向佐佐木先生，正好撞见他在……

Slicing the flyers into ribbons and throwing the confetti into the green barrel.  
将传单切成条条，然后把五彩纸屑扔进绿色桶里。

"What the hell?" Touji exclaimed while I recoiled. He had the same reaction I did. We both turned to Kensuke for an explanation. Of course, I did it more discreetly as to cover up that I had no idea what was going on. "Uh... what just happened?"  
“搞什么鬼？” 当麻惊呼，我也退缩了。他的反应和我一样。我们都转向健介寻求解释。当然，我更谨慎地掩饰自己对发生的事情一无所知。“呃……刚刚发生了什么？”

"Are you stupid?" I answered. "He's _obviously_ cutting the flyers into pieces and throwing them into the barrel."  
"你傻吗？" 我回答道，"他显然是在把传单切成碎片，然后扔进桶里。"

Touji glared at me. "I figured that out, but why?"  
东治瞪了我一眼。"我当然知道，但为什么？"

Kensuke took off his glasses, polished them on his shirt, and put them back on. "I see... this is the huge surprise he was telling us about."  
健介摘下眼镜，用衬衫擦了擦，又戴了回去。"我明白了...这就是他之前跟我们说的那个大惊喜。"

"What?" The other boy leaned forward, and I couldn't help but move in slightly closer to hear what Kensuke had to say. The sound of another pair of flyers being shredded in two echoed through the air.  
"什么？" 另一个男孩向前倾身，我不由自主地稍微靠近了些，想听清健介要说什么。另一对传单被撕成两半的声音在空中回响。

"Once we get up there, we give him our two flyers and he gives us our report cards..."  
"一旦我们上去，就把我们的两张传单给他，他会给我们成绩单..."

_Giving him our flyers? But...  
给他我们的传单？但是..._

"... and then he rips them up..."  
"...然后他把它们撕碎..."

_I only have my flyer, with Shinji's letter on the back...  
我只有我的传单，背面是真嗣的信..._

He stopped. "Do you know what that green barrel is, Touji? It's a compost maker. You put trash in there, fruit peelings, leftovers, stuff like that. Since paper also decomposes, you can use it to make mulch."  
他停了下来。“你知道那个绿色桶是什么吗，东治？那是堆肥制造器。你把垃圾放进去，果皮，剩菜，诸如此类的东西。因为纸张也会分解，你可以用它来制作覆盖物。”

My heart sank. More paper was being ripped up, and I could feel myself breaking in the process. The first love letter Shinji Ikari ever wrote (and perhaps the only), would be torn up, dirtied, and spread on the ground to help thorny flowers grow.  
我的心沉了下去。更多的纸张被撕碎，我感到自己在这一过程中支离破碎。碇真嗣写的第一封情书（也许也是唯一一封），将被撕毁、弄脏，散落在地上，成为刺花生长的养料。

Once half of the line turned their flyers in, our teacher rolled the barrel a quarter turn to the right and resumed collecting paper. The whole world moved in slow motion as I watched flyer after flyer torn and thrown into the machine. I felt the folded up paper through my jeans and thought to myself...  
当队伍的一半人交上传单后，我们的老师将桶向右转了四分之一圈，继续收集纸张。整个世界仿佛慢动作一般，我看着一张张传单被撕碎并扔进机器。我隔着牛仔裤感受到折叠的纸张，心中暗想……

This is unfair. 这不公平。

I didn't know that I had been standing still. Because of this, people from behind me in line cut in front. I was at the very end. Without really thinking, I turned around and started walking aimlessly, trying to make sense of what I was feeling inside.  
我并不知道自己一直呆立不动。因此，身后排队的人纷纷越过我，插到了前面。我落在了最后。未经深思，我转身开始漫无目的地走动，试图理清内心的感受。

Grief? 悲伤吗？

Remorse? 悔恨吗？

No, I think it was confusion.  
不，我觉得那是困惑。

My flyer in exchange for my report card. I watched other students cheerfully hand over their papers to receive those black disks, as if they meant nothing to them. Just a piece of paper. Something so insignificant that they'll toss them out without a care or a second glance.  
我的飞行器换我的成绩单。我看着其他学生兴高采烈地递上他们的试卷，换取那些黑色圆盘，仿佛那些试卷对他们毫无意义。不过是一张纸。一件如此微不足道的东西，他们会毫不在意地扔掉，甚至不会多看一眼。

_I looked up into the heavens...  
我抬头望向天空……_

It meant something to _me_.  
这对我意义重大。

_Looking for a special star...  
寻找一颗特别的星星……_

In my aimless wanderings, I found myself back at our roses. Shinji was still sitting on the ground, watering. I don't know how long I stood over him, watching his back rise and fall with each breath. When he finally did notice my presence behind him, he gazed up at me and asked, "Hey... are you... okay?"  
在我漫无目的的徘徊中，我发现自己回到了我们的玫瑰园。真嗣还坐在地上浇水。我不知道自己在他身后站了多久，看着他的背部随着每一次呼吸起伏。当他终于注意到我站在他身后时，他抬头看着我问道，“嘿……你……还好吗？”

_One caught my eye: I grabbed it...  
其中一本吸引了我的目光：我迅速抓起它..._

"Of course I'm okay, idiot. Why wouldn't I be?" I didn't say this with my usual confidence, but quietly enough so that only he could hear. I really didn't mean to sound like I wasn't in command for once, but I didn't know what else I could say without making me feel worse.  
“我当然没事，傻瓜。我怎么会不呢？”我没有像往常那样自信地说，而是轻声细语，只有他才能听到。我真的不是故意听起来像这次失去了掌控，但除了让我感觉更糟之外，我不知道还能说什么。

I bent over mechanically and picked up my bag. We locked eyes. He always seemed to know just when I was lying. "Something's wrong," he said. The water droplets on the rose petals flickered.  
我机械地弯腰捡起我的包。我们的目光交汇了。他似乎总能准确地知道我何时在撒谎。“有什么不对劲，”他说。玫瑰花瓣上的水珠闪烁着。

_Very closely, I put it to my heart...  
我紧紧地将它贴近心口……_

Should I tell him? Tell him that his letter is going to be mulch. Tell him you have to give it up. Surely he doesn't want to have his love letter being degraded like this. Tell him...  
我该告诉他吗？告诉他他的信即将化为碎屑。告诉他你不得不放弃。他肯定不希望自己的情书被如此糟蹋。告诉他……

Then it struck me. He wasn't the one who cared about his letter.  
然后我恍然大悟。真正在乎那封信的人，不是他。

I was. 我曾是。

_Endlessly, it shined so bright...  
无尽地，它闪耀得如此明亮……_

"It's nothing." And I walked away.  
“没什么。”然后我走开了。

_Young and pulsating, its brightness grew...  
年轻而充满活力，它的光芒逐渐增强..._

I headed back towards the podium, towards the fate of Shinji's letter. The line had dwindled down to a total of three people, and it wouldn't be long. All the shouts and talking of the students around me blended into a chorus of nonsense. But I heard one voice very, very well.  
我朝讲台走去，走向真嗣信件的命运。队伍已经缩减到只剩下三个人，不会太久了。周围学生的喊叫和交谈声混成一片无意义的合唱。但我清楚地听到了一个声音。

"And you're the last one, Miss Langley."  
“而你是最后一个，兰利小姐。”

_One day, I finally understood...  
有一天，我终于明白了..._

I hugged my schoolbag close to me while the teacher looked down on me with expectant eyes. I lowered my head and saw the bulge in my pocket. Once I looked up again, two floppy disks were in Mr. Sasaki's hand. Shinji Ikari and Sohryu Asuka Langley.  
我紧紧抱着书包，老师用期待的眼神俯视着我。我低下头，看到口袋里的凸起。再次抬头时，佐佐木先生手里拿着两张软盘。碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

"Do you have papers?"  
“你有作业吗？”

_Understood that this star was my love for you.  
明白这颗星是我对你的爱。_

Love? Do I understand it?  
爱？我能理解它吗？

No, of course not... but...  
不，当然不能... 但是...

I unzipped my schoolbag. "Yes. I do."  
我拉开书包拉链。“是的，我有。”

**The End 完结**

**Epilogue 尾声**

After getting home from school that day, a young girl sat down to write.  
那天放学回家后，一个小女孩坐下来开始写东西。

| August 4, 2016 2016 年 8 月 4 日<br><br>Shinji, 真嗣，<br><br>I'm sorry I was too stubborn before, but now is the best time (the only time) to swallow my pride and tell you. That letter you wrote, it was wonderful. Really. Please don't think I'm lying to you. I guess... I guess I was so taken aback by how well written it was, I just didn't know what to say to you. In truth, it was the best love letter I had ever received.  <br>之前我太固执了，真的很抱歉。但现在是我放下自尊，告诉你真相的最佳时机（也是唯一时机）。你写的那封信，非常出色。真的。请不要以为我在对你撒谎。我想...我想我被那封信的文采震撼到了，以至于不知道该如何回应你。事实上，那是我收到过的最好的情书。<br><br>There. I said it. Aren't you proud of me? Aren't you? Please say you are... because it was hard to admit it to myself and even harder to write it on paper...  <br>我说出来了。你为我感到骄傲吗？是不是？请告诉我你是...因为承认这一点对我来说很难，写在纸上更是难上加难...<br><br>Wait. There is another reason behind this letter, and it has to do with yours as well. You might already know this, but about the "big surprise" our teacher had planned for us... Turns out we had to give our flyers to him. I only had one, and this was the same paper that had your letter written on the back, in exchange for our report cards. As much as I didn't want to, he told me to hand it over. They were going to shred it, decompose it, and turn it into mulch.  <br>等等。这封信背后还有另一个原因，与你也有关。你可能已经知道，关于我们老师为我们准备的“大惊喜”……原来我们得把传单交给他。我只有一张，而这正是背面写着你信的那张纸，用来交换我们的成绩单。尽管我极不情愿，他还是让我交出去。他们打算把它撕碎、分解，然后变成肥料。<br><br>...I had to. “……我不得不这么做。”<br><br>But... 但是……<br><br>I refused. 我拒绝了。<br><br>Instead, I gave the teacher all the love letters that had accumulated inside my briefcase. I didn't hesitate at all, because I finally _understood_. They had no real love in them, and that's why they were bad. He threw those into the mixture and they are now nourishing the roots of the roses.  <br>相反，我将公文包里积攒的所有情书都交给了老师。我毫不犹豫，因为我终于明白了。那些信里没有真正的爱，所以它们是坏的。他把那些信扔进了混合物中，现在它们正滋养着玫瑰的根。<br><br>_Our_ roses. 我们的玫瑰。<br><br>However, Mr. Sasaki was still stubborn and insisted that the flyers were the only ones that would do. We don't get our report cards now because of that. So if you were wondering why, there's the reason. Sorry. Misato's going to have to pick them up, but I think it's better this way. First off, I don't have to hand my crappy grades to her myself, and second...  <br>然而，佐佐木先生依旧固执，坚持认为只有传单才合适。就因为这，我们现在拿不到成绩单了。所以如果你想知道为什么，这就是原因。抱歉。美里得自己去取了，但我觉得这样更好。首先，我不必亲手把糟糕的成绩单交给她，其次...<br><br>I get to keep your letter.  <br>我可以保留你的信。<br><br>You know, I feel much safer knowing that this will never reach your eyes, so therefore I can say here what I couldn't say to you before. Even if you did stumble on this... I'm glad that you couldn't understand. It helps to know German, you know.  <br>你知道吗，知道这封信永远不会被你看到，我感到安心多了，因此我可以说出之前无法对你说的话。即使你偶然发现了...我很高兴你无法理解。要知道，懂德语还是有帮助的。<br><br>Well, there really isn't anything else to say. I could humor myself and write you a love letter in return, but girls shouldn't write stuff like this to boys. But since you bothered to find out how to say "I love you" in German, I could at least use my limited kanji knowledge and say...  <br>嗯，确实没什么别的可说了。我可以自娱自乐地给你回一封情书，但女孩子不应该给男孩子写这种东西。不过既然你费心去查了德语怎么说“我爱你”，我至少可以用我有限的汉字知识说……<br><br>Aishiteru, Shinji. 我爱你，真嗣。<br><br>Kon'ya wa hitotsuboshi ga kirei desu,  <br>今晚的星星很美，  <br>Sohryu Asuka Langley 惣流·明日香·兰格雷 |

_The evening stars are beautiful tonight.  
今晚的夜星真美。_

With a contented smile, she languidly reached for a silver picture frame on her desk. One that had been devoid of a photograph since the day it was bought. One that was waiting for the perfect snapshot, because no ordinary one would do for such elegance.  
她带着满足的微笑，慵懒地伸手去拿桌上的银色相框。这个相框自购买之日起就一直空着，它在等待那张完美的照片，因为普通的照片配不上这份优雅。

The girl had found that picture.  
女孩找到了那张照片。

She carefully cropped it with scissors, ensuring the fit. She then removed another piece of paper from her pocket and carefully unwrinkled it. She folded the two letters, one old and one new, to fit the dimensions of the frame. Once that was completed, she secured the felt backing and turned the frame over to admire her work.  
她小心翼翼地用剪刀裁剪，确保尺寸合适。随后，她从口袋里取出另一张纸，仔细地抚平皱褶。她将两封信，一封旧的和一封新的，折叠起来以适应相框的尺寸。完成后，她固定好绒布背衬，将相框翻转过来欣赏自己的作品。

On the front, a postcard with two yellow roses winked back at her from underneath dewy leaves. In the corner, printed with beautiful calligraphy: "Yellow represents friendship. A friendship that suffers the thorns will yield striking flowers". The girl smiled again, and set the frame to its original place.  
正面，一张明信片上两朵黄玫瑰在露珠点缀的叶子下向她眨眼。角落里，用美丽的书法印着：“黄色代表友谊。历经荆棘的友谊将绽放出绚丽的花朵。”女孩再次微笑，将相框放回原位。

Two people knew the significance of the yellow roses, but only one would ever know what lies beneath.  
两人知晓黄玫瑰的深意，但只有一人能洞悉其下的秘密。

Author's notes: I must admit, this was sitting for a while in my "Complete us, you wench!" folder until mentions of a WAFF-a-thon came up. You readers asked me to do a sappy one-shot S/A that fits into the _real Eva timeline, and there it was. This is a semi-continuation of "To My Dearest Honey", and the picture frame reference was something only those readers would catch. I think it stand well enough on its own though._  
作者的话：我必须承认，这篇作品在我“快点完成，你这泼妇！”的文件夹里躺了好一阵子，直到有人提起 WAFF-a-thon（温馨马拉松）。你们这些读者要求我写一篇符合真实 Eva 时间线的甜蜜短篇 S/A 故事，于是就有了这篇。这是“致我亲爱的甜心”的半续篇，其中相框的提及只有那些读者才能领会。不过我认为它本身也足够独立完整。

A couple well deserved words of gratitude... firstly, to "my dearest honeys" Rev'd and Javier Caine. After all my grammar/diction/syntax/stupid mistakes, I think my prereaders _deserve the title. To Lord Malachite for giving me suggestions on salutations (*starry eyed*), and to all the authors I discreetly stole fic titles from. If you don't know what I'm talking about, never mind then. ^_^ Confession time: I'm not a good enough writer to pen that wonderful "A Special Star" poem you saw above. Thanks to Sean for sending that to me._  
几句当之无愧的感谢之词……首先，向“我亲爱的甜心们”Rev'd 和 Javier Caine 致谢。在我犯下所有语法/措辞/句式/愚蠢错误之后，我想我的预读者们配得上这个称号。感谢 Lord Malachite 为我提供问候语的建议（*眼中闪烁着星星*），以及所有我悄悄借用小说标题的作者们。如果你不知道我在说什么，那就别在意了。^_^ 坦白时刻：我还没好到能写出上面那首美妙的“一颗特别的星”诗。感谢 Sean 把它发给我。

You men now have the power to please your women when it comes to writing love letters, so stop disappointing us already guys! Get those calligraphy pens to scented stationary and send all attempts (failed or otherwise) to coronaflare@mail.com along with some constructive criticism. Okay, maybe not the first part, but seriously... give me criticism. It's the only way a writer can get better. Until later... keep on writing!  
你们现在有了写情书取悦女性的能力，别再让我们失望了，伙计们！拿起那些书法笔，蘸上香薰信纸，把所有尝试（无论成败）都发到 coronaflare@mail.com，并附上一些建设性的批评。好吧，也许不是第一部分，但说真的...给我批评。这是作家进步的唯一途径。下次见...继续写下去！
