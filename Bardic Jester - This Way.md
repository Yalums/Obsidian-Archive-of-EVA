AN- So this was originally supposed to be a One Shot. The chapters may feel a little different from another because each were written years after the ones before. Enjoy!  
本意是作为一篇短篇来创作的。由于各章节之间相隔数年，因此风格上可能稍有差异。请尽情享受阅读！

Shinji sat at the table staring absently at his food. The room seemed to surround him, choking the air which he so desperately needed to survive. The meal was set and all those who needed to be there were, yet there seemed to be two black holes of nothingness on opposite sides. The walls had caved in and were starting to crush Shinji. This was a night he neither, wanted to be here or wanted to be alone.  
真嗣坐在桌旁，目光空洞地望着眼前的食物。房间仿佛将他紧紧包围，令他呼吸困难。晚餐已经准备妥当，该来的人也都到了，但两侧却像是各有一个吞噬一切的黑洞。墙壁似乎在向他逼近，压迫感越来越强。这个夜晚，他既不愿身处此地，也不想孤单一人。

The day had gone by smoothly in the beginning. There had been no plans, no falls and, no tears. There was something that had lingered on Shinji's wall though, when he had awoken. It had breathed in the cold and only exhaled the warm air as if it were a living exhaust pipe. He had been dreaming of pandemonium and anarchy, without any true basis of reality to use as foundation.  
最初，这一天还算平稳。没有既定计划，没有跌倒，也没有哭泣。然而，当真嗣醒来时，他注意到墙上似乎有什么东西。它在寒冷中吸气，只呼出温暖的空气，宛如一个有生命的排气管。他的梦境充斥着混乱与无序，缺乏任何现实依据。

Then his body was shaken by the sound of his alarm clock. It was a small one, created in the design of a Penguin. It had originally been his teacher's but Shinji won it off her when she lost a bet on how many students would show up to class one day. Shinji slowly moved from his resting ground and hit the alarm clock over the head harshly. He then repeatedly did it three more times, in five minute intervals.  
接着，他的身体因闹钟的响声而颤动。那是一只小巧的企鹅造型闹钟，原属于他的老师，因老师在一次关于上课学生人数的打赌中输给了他。真嗣慢慢从床上坐起，用力敲了闹钟一下，随后每隔五分钟又重复敲了三次。

When the ground had truly begun to shake, Shinji had been like a man standing on top of a small platform, which was on a ten foot aluminum pole. The worst place to be during an earthquake, or Armageddon, whichever one wished to call it.  
当地面剧烈震动时，真嗣犹如站在一个置于十英尺铝杆之上的小平台上，这无疑是地震或末日降临时最危险的处境，无论你如何称呼这一刻。

Asuka grabbed him and shook him like he was a rag doll. She was calling his name and was probably saying something about how stupid he was. He took it in strides though and threw the covers off of himself to quickly get out of bed. This plan of action seemed to be futile as he had miscalculated something.  
明日香紧紧抓住他，像摇晃布偶一样猛烈摇晃。她一边喊他的名字，一边可能还在数落他的愚蠢。尽管如此，他还是从容应对，一把掀开被子，迅速起身。然而，他的行动计划似乎注定失败，因为他忽略了某个关键因素。

Asuka slapped him on the face and started yelling about how much of a pervert he was. She was laughing a little though, as she had made a mental note on the fact that this seemed to be happening more frequently then not. Shinji jumped up and ran into the bathroom. Asuka's first thought was to follow him, but decided instead to get his stuff ready, which seemed to be covering the floor.  
明日香给了他一记耳光，随即大声指责他是个变态。她边说边笑，心里暗自觉得这种事似乎越来越常发生。真嗣一跃而起，冲进了洗手间。明日香起初想跟过去，但转念一想，还是决定先帮他收拾散落一地的东西。

Shinji often wondered why his mother always let Asuka in like that. Why couldn't his mother just wake him up. It truly didn't seem to be too hard of a task. He washed his face off with some soap and he began to look at himself in the mirror. You get very self conscious when you get woken up half naked everyday by a beautiful girl.  
真嗣常感疑惑，母亲为何总让明日香那样随意进入。为何母亲不直接唤醒他，这本非难事。他洗脸后，对着镜子端详自己。每日被美少女半裸唤醒，让人不由自主地变得敏感多虑。

He had quickly gotten out and he ate breakfast like it was going to be his last. The both of them had run out the door so quickly that he had barely enough time to get his footing. Asuka was laughing for no reason, yet she seemed incapable of talking. The silence rang in his ears. He was tempted to listen to music but she would probably take offense to it.  
他匆匆出门，吃早餐时仿佛这是最后一餐。两人都急忙冲出门，他差点没站稳。明日香无故地笑着，却好像说不出话。沉默在他耳边回响。他想听音乐，但又怕她介意。

They got into the class a couple of minutes early. Shinji just discussed with Kensuke and Touji about the normal daily affairs. The photo ring the three of them were running had been moving along slowly. They were trying to compete with the two other ones that had found there way onto the school grounds. They had had many problems about getting someone to take most of the pictures, as Touji would be easy to spot and Shinji always seemed to have Asuka not far behind. Kensuke was the most likely to take the photos but he didn't seemed very interested.  
他们提前几分钟进了教室。真嗣刚和健介、徹二聊了些日常杂事。他们三人负责的摄影戒指活动进展缓慢。他们正努力与另外两个闯入校园的戒指竞争。找人拍摄大部分照片成了难题，因为徹二太显眼，真嗣身边又总有明日香。健介虽是最可能拍照的人选，但他对此似乎兴致缺缺。

Asuka was chatting away freely with Hikari, not truly getting anywhere but the two of them seemed to like just running their mouths off into the sky, waiting for them to fall back down. The rest of the class was pretty silent and nothing was happening.  
明日香和光正无拘无束地闲聊，尽管话题并未深入，但两人似乎乐在其中，对着天空畅谈，期待话语如雨般洒落。教室里其他同学都静悄悄的，一片宁静。

After their teacher Misato made a very, unprofessional entry into her class, the days events started to unfold. Shinji was chatting on his laptop about things with Touji when all of the sudden someone else started to instant message to him. Being very surprised he looked around the room wondering who this could be. After giving up, he started to talk back. Honestly he was surprised; no one ever took notice to him. When it came to the three stooges Touji was the out spoken leader and was often the one to talk to when someone asked the three of them a question. The only other person who took notice to Shinji was Asuka. There really wasn't anyone else who cared about his existence. He was pretty invisible.  
老师 Misato 以极不专业的态度进入教室后，当天的一系列事件随之展开。Shinji 正与 Touji 在笔记本电脑上闲聊，突然收到一条即时消息，令他大吃一惊，四处张望试图找出是谁。放弃猜测后，他开始回复。说实话，他感到意外；从未有人注意过他。在三人组中，Touji 是口无遮拦的领头羊，通常是别人向他们提问时的对话对象。除了 Asuka，再无他人关注 Shinji。他几乎是个透明人。

When the class was almost over, the person asked Shinji to join her (he was almost sure she was girl) outside during the break between classes. Shinji asked her at the end what her name was and that he honestly didn't know who he was talking to. When he sent that he heard a distinguishable laugh from behind him, he bit his lip and looked at the screen. "Rei" was all that it said. "Shit" Shinji swore to himself. This was the one girl he did not want this to be. Ever since her "interesting" first class Asuka had acted like she was an annoying bitch who was full of herself. If Asuka saw him talking to Rei, she would skin him alive.  
课程接近尾声时，那人邀请碇真嗣课间休息时一起出去（他几乎肯定对方是女生）。课程结束时，真嗣问起她的名字，坦白自己并不清楚在和谁说话。发送消息后，他听到身后传来一阵熟悉的笑声，不禁咬了咬嘴唇，目光转向屏幕。屏幕上只显示着“绫波”。“糟糕”，真嗣暗自咒骂。这正是他最不希望遇到的人。自从那次“有趣”的第一堂课以来，明日香就表现得像个自大的讨厌鬼。如果明日香看到他和绫波交谈，她肯定会大发雷霆。

One disease Shinji seemed to suffer from though was the one of honour. Once he had given his word he would not back down. This semi-suicidal mentality had already gotten him into some trouble but he still stood by it. Sometimes he viewed himself as a masochist and other times he just thought of himself as a slave to routine. Neither of which, upon further consolation, he would deem to be a good thing.  
真嗣似乎确实患有一种疾病，那就是对荣誉的执着。一旦他承诺了某事，便绝不食言。这种近乎自毁的心态已让他陷入困境，但他依旧坚守。有时他觉得自己像个受虐狂，有时又认为自己是习惯的奴隶。无论哪种，经过深思熟虑，他都认为这并非好事。

When the break started and Shinji escaped the sight of Asuka, he made his way outside. He was surprised to see that girl already there. Then again he was turning around every two seconds expecting to see one of the scariest things in the world, an angry Asuka. Rei was twiddling her legs in an abnormal fashion, and she seemed to be whistling to herself. Since her arrival she had seldom made any friends and seemed to enjoy her own company more then that of people. This seemed alien to Shinji who had been alone most of his life, and would have jumped on any chance to escape from it. Something he did.  
休息一开始，真嗣就躲开了明日香的视线，悄悄走到外面。他惊讶地发现那个女孩已经在了。不过，他每隔两秒就紧张地回头，生怕撞见世界上最可怕的景象——怒气冲冲的明日香。零正以一种奇特的方式晃动着双腿，自得其乐地吹着口哨。自从她来到这里，几乎没交到什么朋友，似乎更享受独处的时光。这对真嗣来说颇为陌生，他大半生都在孤独中度过，只要有逃离孤独的机会，他定会紧紧抓住。他确实这么做了。

When she saw him, Rei gave Shinji one hell of a scare. She got up and hugged him. Shinji almost immediately pulled away and took a few steps back. "Sorry, that was uncalled for," Rei said, realizing that Shinji was not comfortable in that situation. Shinji was about to apologize, even if it was for nothing. Rei cut him off though, which Shinji was a little happy about since he didn't think that that was the right thing to do. "I want to say sorry for that whole mishap on the first day. I went a little overboard. I was just so surprised when I saw you in the class."  
当她看到他时，绫波丽吓了真嗣一大跳。她起身拥抱了他，但真嗣立刻挣脱并退后几步。“抱歉，我不该那样，”绫波丽意识到真嗣感到不适。真嗣正要开口道歉，尽管并无必要。绫波丽及时打断了他，这让真嗣暗自庆幸，因为他觉得那不是恰当之举。“我想为第一天的事故道歉，我有些反应过度了。看到你在班上，我真的很意外。”

Shinji stared at her, there was something up. Being with Asuka for extentded periods of time taught him how to know if a girl is just saying something without there being a meaning. "Well, I am sorry too, I shouldn't have been running and well, sorry" Shinji said. He kicked himself mentally though because he had just done what he was trying not to. Seeing the angry in Shinji's eyes Rei laughed to herself slightly.  
真嗣凝视着她，察觉到异样。与明日香长时间的相处让他学会了分辨女孩是否只是随口一说，并无真意。“我也道歉，不该跑的，对不起。”真嗣说。然而，他内心却在自责，因为他刚刚违背了自己的初衷。看到真嗣眼中的怒意，绫波不禁轻笑。

The two of them continued discussing things, things that Shinji hadn't really talked much about with other people. Then again, Shinji never really talked to anyone. He had once decided that when he got older he would become a mute, just because it would be easier that way.  
他们俩继续探讨着那些新二鲜少与人谈及的话题。实际上，新二几乎不与人交流。他曾想过，长大后干脆做个哑巴，这样生活或许更轻松。

At the end of the break, the two of them walked back into class, slowly, as if they were ants coming back from carrying something many times their weight. When they got slightly close to the class Shinji said something about how he had forgotten something. Rei stared at him weirdly and just shrugged her shoulders. Shinji turned around and hid around a corner. He waited until no one could say that the two of them were walking together somewhere.  
休息结束之际，两人如同负重数倍于自身体重的蚂蚁，缓缓返回教室。接近教室时，真嗣忽然想起有东西遗忘了。零以一种奇怪的眼神看着他，随后只是耸了耸肩。真嗣随即转身，藏身于角落，直至无人能察觉他们曾同行于某处。

Shinji arrived right before the bell rung and sighed inwardly; freeing himself from the stress he had just built up inside of himself. He sat at his desk and opened his laptop. The class was mostly uneventful and peaceful, that is until another strange person started to talk to him. Shinji smiled to himself, he seemed to be popular today, or at least by his standards. The person wrote the message "Aren't you and Asuka together?" Shinji quickly turned around trying to see who the hell was talking to him. He quickly responded "No!".  
真嗣在铃声即将响起时赶到，内心暗自松了口气，释放了刚才积压的紧张情绪。他坐到座位上，打开笔记本电脑。这节课大部分时间都很平静，直到另一位奇怪的同学开始与他交谈。真嗣心中暗笑，今天他似乎挺受欢迎的，至少对他来说是这样。对方发来消息：“你和明日香不是情侣吗？”真嗣急忙回头想看清楚是谁在问他，立刻回答：“不是！”

Then another unexpected thing happened. The person wrote "I saw you and Rei! Be more careful, because Asuka didn't respond the same way." Shinji froze. His mind shut down and his lungs lost all of their air. As if he had forgotten how to breath Shinji tried to eat the air around himself. How could this be happening? Who was this person? There was no way that Asuka would ever say that, so he knew the person was bluffing, yet the person seemed to care about Asuka's and Shinji's relationship enough to try to rule out any person threatening it. He breathed in deeply when he figured this out. It had seemed to take some of the pressure off of him.  
接着，又一件出乎意料的事情发生了。那人留言说：“我看到你和绫波了！要更加小心，因为明日香并没有同样的反应。”真嗣顿时僵住，思绪一片空白，肺中的空气仿佛被抽空。他似乎忘记了如何呼吸，拼命地想要吸入周围的空气。这究竟是怎么回事？这个人是谁？明日香绝不可能说出那样的话，所以他断定那人在撒谎，但那人似乎很在乎明日香和真嗣的关系，以至于想要排除任何可能威胁到这段关系的人。想通这一点后，他深深吸了一口气，感觉身上的压力减轻了不少。

When lunch came around, the three stooges were eating at the balcony (or roof, I can't remember which it was in the show). Shinji was making a deal to buy all Asuka pictures from the ring, and a couple Rei ones too. The other two had no troubles about the Asuka thing, Touji was happy when Shinji mentioned Rei but Kensuke seemed a little troubled.  
午餐时分，三个小丑在阳台（或屋顶，记不清节目里具体是哪里了）用餐。真嗣正与摊主商议，欲购入所有明日香的照片，外加几张零的。另外两人对明日香的照片并无异议，提及零时，东治显得很开心，然而健介却显得有些心事重重。  
Then without warning, disaster stroke; Rei walked towards them. She was pretty close too, when the three noticed. Shinji panicked, didn't this girl have any common sense. If Asuka saw, then it would mean the death of all three. Shinji's first idea was jumping and praying, but he decided that would just make him look a little suspicious. So he ruled that idea out. Touji, when he noticed he practically ran as fast as he could without looking to obvious. Kensuke noticed too late and was stuck where he was sitting.  
随后毫无预警，灾难突至；绫向他们走来。当三人察觉时，她已近在咫尺。真嗣心慌意乱，这女孩难道不懂常识吗？若明日香目睹此景，三人必将遭殃。真嗣本想跳起祈祷，但又觉得此举只会引人猜疑。因此他放弃了这个念头。东治发现后，几乎是以最快速度逃离，同时尽量保持自然。而健介反应迟缓，只能原地不动。

"Hey Shinji!" Rei said in this ultra happy voice. Both Shinji's and Kensuke's mouths dropped to the ground. They couldn't believe what they were seeing. She walked up to Shinji and hugged him. Yep, she was a hugger. Shinji was too surprised to do anything and so the hug lasted a little longer then expected. Unlucky for Shinji though Asuka and Hikari were walking that way. Shinji was so mortified yet he couldn't move. As if the gods intervened though, Hikari saw first, gave Shinji a mean stare and diverted Asuka in another direction, and Asuka never noticed. Things clicked and Shinji realized that it was Hikari who had threatened him.  
"嘿，真嗣！"绫波用异常欢快的声音说道。真嗣和健介惊得目瞪口呆。他们难以置信眼前发生的一切。绫波走向真嗣，给了他一个拥抱。她确实是个爱拥抱的人。真嗣惊呆了，动弹不得，这个拥抱比预想的要久。不巧的是，明日香和光正朝这边走来。真嗣尴尬至极，却无法挣脱。就在这时，光先看到了，她恶狠狠地瞪了真嗣一眼，巧妙地将明日香引向另一边，使她未曾察觉。真相大白，真嗣这才明白是光对他进行了威胁。

Shinji then diverted his attention towards Rei. "Hello! How is it going?" Shinji asked forcing the words to come out.  
真嗣转而看向绫波，努力开口问道："你好！近来可好？"

"Fine, fine," Rei said letting go and taking a couple steps back.  
"行了，行了，" 蕾说着，松开手向后退了几步。

"You want to go back on the ground and talk?" Shinji said, getting a little more comfortable. Rei muttered an agreement and the two of them left the balcony. Leaving a still flabbergasted Kensuke sitting in the same spot.  
"你想下楼再谈吗？" 碇真嗣说着，稍微放松了些。绫波丽低声应和，两人随即离开了阳台。留下仍旧一脸错愕的洞木光坐在原处。

The two of them talked about life and how everything is going. They discussed music, movies, hobbies and Shinji really felt like there was something between the two of them. He had never really met anyone so similar to him. What scared him though was that Rei was getting comfortable, very comfortable. She was moving closer and closer to him. Until finally she was practically on top of him. A position Shinji found most comfortable. Asuka wasn't one for human contact. Then the bell rung and the two of them got up. Rei then did something that was totally unexpected. She kissed Shinji, just a little peck. Not really big enough to mean anything, except for the fact that it was Shinji's first kiss. Good lord was this Rei girl ever strange.  
他们俩聊起了生活和近况。话题涉及音乐、电影和各自的爱好，真嗣感到两人之间似乎有种特别的联系。他从未遇到过如此相似的人。然而，让他不安的是，绫波显得越来越放松，她不断靠近，最终几乎依偎在他身上。真嗣觉得这种亲近很舒服。相比之下，明日香不喜欢与人有身体接触。铃声响起，两人起身准备离开。这时，绫波出人意料地吻了真嗣，虽只是轻轻一啄，却意义非凡，因为那是真嗣的初吻。这个叫绫波的女孩，真是让人捉摸不透。

When the two of them got into class and sat down, Shinji was just hoping to put his head down and sleep. Instead when he opened his laptop he got a scary message. "What the fuck! Why the hell did you do that? I saved you the first time but I wasn't able to the second time! You are a royal dumbass you know!" Shinji quickly turned around to see Hikari steaming angry. Although, surprisingly enough, Asuka seemed completely normal.  
两人一进教室坐定，真嗣本想趴桌小憩。不料，他打开笔记本电脑，却弹出一条令人心惊的消息。"你到底干了什么好事！第一次我还能救你，第二次却无能为力！你真是蠢到家了！"真嗣急忙回头，只见光怒气冲冲。然而，出乎意料的是，明日香却显得异常平静。

Shinji swallowed hard. 真嗣费力地咽了口唾沫。

At the end of the day, Shinji barely caught up to Asuka, to walk home like usual. When he had left the school she wasn't waiting for him like usual and had already started to walk home. Surprisingly enough, she was still acting normal, as if Shinji wasn't there. When he caught up to her he asked "What is wrong?" To which he received no reply. Shinji then had continued to repeat this all the way until they got into their apartment building to no avail. When they started to climb the stairs, the silence was killing Shinji. When they got half way up, in the middle of a flight of stairs, Asuka sat down.  
日暮时分，真嗣好不容易追上了明日香，一如往常地一同踏上归途。他离开学校时，她并未如常等候，而是已先行一步。出乎意料，她举止如常，仿佛真嗣并不存在。追上她后，真嗣关切地问：“发生什么事了？”却未得到任何回答。他一路重复询问，直至踏入公寓楼，依旧徒劳。爬楼梯时，沉默愈发沉重。半途，在一层楼梯间，明日香停下脚步，坐了下来。

Then tears just started to build up in her eyes. "What, do I have to flash you my panties too to get you to kiss me?" She asked. This set Shinji totally aback and he almost fell. Then she actually raised her skirt and flashed him her panties. Which almost killed Shinji. Then she stood up and was acting as if she was about to kiss him. Which Shinji stopped mid-way. Asuka just fell back down and started crying.  
泪水开始在她的眼眶中打转。"怎么，非得我掀裙子给你看内裤，你才肯吻我吗？"她质问道。这话让真嗣惊得目瞪口呆，差点没站稳。她竟然真的掀起了裙子，露出了内裤，差点没把真嗣吓晕。随后，她站起身来，似乎要吻他，却被真嗣中途制止。明日香颓然坐下，泪水夺眶而出。

"What am I not good enough for you? I did all that bitch did!" Asuka cried. She then put her head into her hands. Shinji stared at her for a couple of seconds until she just started to run away. Shinji tried to stop her but it didn't help.  
"难道我还不够好吗？我做了那女人所做的一切！" 明日香哭泣着说。接着，她双手捂脸。真嗣注视了她片刻，直到她转身跑开。真嗣试图拦住她，却未能成功。

As if this day couldn't get any worse the days previously decided plans included Asuka coming over to Shinji's for supper.  
似乎这一天已经够糟了，而早前的计划还安排了明日香来真嗣家共进晚餐。

When Asuka entered through the door, there was no talking. She seemed to be fine, excluded slightly swollen eyes. The meal was pretty silent and uneventful. Shinji's parent's kept trying to talk to either one of the two but was receiving no replies.  
明日香进门时，屋内鸦雀无声。她看似无恙，只是眼眶微肿。用餐期间异常沉静，毫无波澜。真嗣的父母屡次尝试与两人搭话，却始终未获回应。

Finally at the end of the meal the two of them went into the living room to watch some television like the usually did on these sorts of occasions. Again all it was just silence, as if the both of them had forgotten their voice boxes somewhere else. Finally the both of them sat on the couch. After a minute or two Asuka moved and started to lean on Shinji.  
餐后，两人如常步入客厅，打算看会儿电视。四周依旧静悄悄，仿佛他们的声音都遗失在了某个角落。最后，他们并肩坐在沙发上。片刻后，明日香轻轻挪动，依偎在真嗣身旁。

Shinji swallowed hard. 真嗣费力地咽了口唾沫。

### Chapter 2: Deviation 偏差
AN- Well, I was planning on having the story just be a one shot, but since so many people kept asking me to add more, I thought I would write one more chapter. I was planning on having this only be around 2500 words, but I just kept going. In my opinion it is not as good as the first one, but hopefully you'll like it too.  
原本打算让这个故事以短篇形式完结，但众多读者的期待让我决定再添一章。起初计划篇幅约 2500 字，却越写越长。虽然自认为不及首篇精彩，但愿你同样能享受其中。

Shinji's dream had upset him more then he would have liked. It was a shame though, since he didn't remember what the dream had actually been about or what had happened. All he knew was that it had disturbed him for reasons which he was unsure about. He looked at his alarm clock to see that darn penguin looking at him. As if it had sensed his negative thoughts, his alarm went off at that exact second.  
真嗣的梦境让他比预期中更为困扰。可惜的是，他记不清梦的内容和经过，只知道自己因此感到不安，具体原因却模糊不清。他瞥了一眼闹钟，那只令人不悦的企鹅正盯着他。仿佛察觉到他的不快，闹钟就在那一瞬间响了起来。

Swearing to himself he walked to it and beat down on it's head. Shinji never quite knew why he had so much discontent for this little thing but he knew if there was a penguin hunt similar to the seal hunt, he would jump on board.  
他暗自发誓，走向那小东西，狠狠地击打它的头部。真嗣始终不明白自己为何对这小家伙怀有如此深的不满，但他清楚，若是有类似捕猎海豹的企鹅狩猎，他定会毫不犹豫地参与其中。

He didn't usually actually get up on time, after the first ring, Shinji found himself lacking anything to do. He would usually just sleep through the first three or four rings, in fact then Asuka would usually wake him up. The darned alarm clock never really did anything.  
他一般不会按时起床，第一次闹铃响后，真嗣发现自己无所事事。他往往会睡过前三四次闹铃，通常是明日香来叫醒他。那个闹钟其实从来就没起过作用。

Shinji put on some clothes, praying that Asuka was not going to just randomly open the door. He left his room and walked to his dining room. Well it was more of just an extension to his kitchen. His parents were both in the room which really kind of annoyed Shinji. Why couldn't either of them wake him up? Both of them got up before he did and neither of them left before he had too.  
真嗣穿好衣服，暗自祈祷明日香别突然开门。他走出房间，来到餐厅，那不过是厨房的延伸。父母都在屋内，这让真嗣感到有些不快。为何他们俩都不叫醒他？他们比他起得早，却都等到他必须离开时才走。

They were both lazy Shinji had decided.  
真嗣认为，他们俩都很懒。

As he sat down neither of his parents seemed to notice him. His father had his face buried behind a newspaper and his mother was fixing some food at the counter. Neither of them were very eccentric people, which is, in a way, the place that Shinji had always assumed his subtleness and shyness came from.  
他坐下时，父母似乎都未察觉。父亲埋头读报，母亲在柜台边忙着准备食物。他们并非性格古怪之人，某种程度上，真嗣认为自己的内敛和羞涩正是源自这样的家庭氛围。

It took a minute but finally Shinji's mother noticed him at the table. She had just finished whatever she had been preparing and was about to serve it to his father, but stopped halfway, gave it to Shinji and sat down next to him.  
片刻之后，真嗣的母亲才注意到他在桌旁。她刚忙完手头的活儿，正准备给真嗣的父亲端上食物，却在半途停下，转而将食物递给真嗣，随后坐在他身旁。

"Honey," She started, but stopped right afterwards as if she was having a problem coming up with the exact words to say. Shinji had not really realised this though, he had started already to indulge himself with, what was almost his father's breakfast. "Is there something wrong with you and Asuka?" she asked staring as deeply into Shinji's soul; as much as Shinji could imagine someone being able to.  
"亲爱的，" 她刚开口却又戛然而止，仿佛在斟酌合适的措辞。而真嗣并未留意到这一点，他已开始享用那几乎是他父亲的那份早餐。"你和明日香之间是不是有什么问题？" 她目光深邃地凝视着真嗣，仿佛能洞悉他的内心深处。

Shinji coughed a little bit as this had taken him by surprise, and had happened at the inopportune moment of him swallowing a gulp of food. He looked at her and quickly faked a smile "What do you mean?"  
真嗣因为这突如其来的情况轻咳了一声，恰好是他咽下食物的尴尬时刻。他望向她，急忙挤出一个笑容：“你指的是什么？”

His mother, who could obviously see right through that just kind of, frowned a little bit. "It's just that, you two were acting quite peculiar yesterday." She passed for a couple of breathes. "And you did not stare into her eyes at any point; you usually consume yourself in them."  
他的母亲显然一眼就看穿了，只是微微皱了皱眉。“你们俩昨天的行为确实有些古怪。”她停顿了几秒。“而且你一次也没有凝视她的眼睛；你通常会深深地凝视着它们。”

At this Shinji did not just cough, he plain choked for a couple of seconds. He really needed to work on his rhythm and when to swallow. He looked at his mother and was surprised to see concern in her face. His mother was good at reading people, Shinji never really knew how she did it, he tried though, to modest success. "There is nothing wrong mother," Shinji flatly lied.  
对此，真嗣不仅咳嗽，还实实在在地噎住了几秒钟。他确实需要练习吞咽的节奏和时机。他望向母亲，惊讶地发现她脸上写满了担忧。母亲很会读懂人心，真嗣虽然一直不明白她的秘诀，但也曾尝试模仿，只是效果一般。“妈，我没事。”真嗣故作镇定地撒了个谎。

His mother looked at him as if she was planning on saying something else, but she was interrupted. There was a subtle knock on the door. Shinji's mother seemed to be let down that they were not going to finish their conversation, but Shinji became even more uncomfortable.  
他的母亲凝视着他，仿佛还有话要说，却被打断了。一阵微弱的敲门声响起。真嗣的母亲显得有些失落，因为他们的对话无法继续，而真嗣则愈发感到不自在。

When Shinji's mother opened the door Asuka was smiling, but just borderline, where she usually had a large one. The eating area was in complete view of the front door. Asuka's expression, when she saw Shinji there, turned extremely sour. Shinji's mother was the only one in view as well, to see her slight tears. Asuka quickly bowed her head, said a broken "Sorry," and ran down the hallway.  
当真嗣的母亲开门时，明日香脸上挂着一丝勉强的微笑，与她平日的灿烂笑容相去甚远。用餐区正对着前门，明日香一见到真嗣，脸色立刻阴沉下来。只有真嗣的母亲注意到她眼角的泪光。明日香急忙低头，含糊地说了声“对不起”，便匆匆跑向走廊。

Shinji's mother looked back at Shinji with a very confused look on her face. Shinji just kind of shrugged his shoulders and tried to flash another of those fake smiles, but it was unsuccessful. He just hung his head for a while, until standing up and quickly running after Asuka.  
真嗣的母亲转头望向真嗣，面露困惑之色。真嗣耸耸肩，试图再次挤出那种假笑，却未能如愿。他垂头片刻，随即起身，快步追向明日香。

Shinji could not quite differentiate the emotions that he was feeling. Was it pity, or something more? Asuka and he had been close for years. Though was it more out of necessity that Shinji stuck onto her. Was it because he literally had never, other then the stooges, been able to actually obtain another friend that he and Asuka had been so close?  
真嗣难以明确区分自己内心的情感。这是怜悯，还是更深层的情感？他与明日香已相交多年。或许真嗣紧随她更多是出于无奈。毕竟，除了那几个小丑，他从未真正结交过其他朋友，这或许解释了他与明日香为何如此亲密。

It had always confused him a little though. Asuka could actually make other friends. Yet she had decided that no one in her world was more important to her than him. He knew she and Hikari were close, and that she had other friends too, but she never went out of her way to go to school with any of them.  
尽管如此，这总让他感到一丝困惑。明日香其实能结交其他朋友，但她却认定，在她心中，没有人比他更重要。他知道她和光关系密切，也有其他朋友，但她从不特意与她们同行去学校。

Once Shinji had matured a bit after they had started being friends, he had thought that Asuka had been his friend for only one reason. She was a controlling person, and needed someone to control,  
真嗣在和明日香成为朋友后稍显成熟，那时他觉得明日香与他为友，仅因她控制欲强，总想掌控他人。

After a couple of minutes Shinji had not been able to catch up to her, for one simple reason. He had assumed that she had made her way to school. This was not the case though. As when Shinji finally got to school, her desk was empty. Though now he wouldn't have to be extremely sensitive to just how he was acting.  
几分钟后，真嗣没能追上她，原因很简单：他误以为她已经去了学校。然而，当他赶到学校时，却发现她的座位空着。这样一来，他也不必过于小心翼翼地注意自己的一举一动了。

Most of the day had been pretty regular. Shinji had stayed in Ms. Misato's class for lunch and the two of them had just talked. She was a lot less of a teacher to Shinji, more of a sister.  
那天大部分时间都很平常。真嗣在美里老师的班上吃了午饭，两人只是闲聊。她对真嗣而言，与其说是老师，更像是姐姐。

The conversations had been light little exchanges. Most of the time she was complaining that her boyfriend was acting like a total dick the last couple of days. She never went into too much detail to truly understand the situation but just enough to paint a rough picture of what may have happened.  
谈话内容轻松，多是些小交流。她常抱怨男友最近几天行为恶劣，虽未详述细节，但足以让人对情况有个大致了解。

At the end of the day of school Shinji thanked every deity that he could think of for letting it be over. All that was going through his mind was getting home and sleeping all of his thoughts away. As he left the dark brown and intimidating doors his eyes surveyed the surrounding area. In every direction another kid going somewhere interesting seemed to intrude on the total calm that should and was usually going through the area.  
放学时分，Shinji 感激地向脑海中浮现的每一位神明致谢，庆幸这漫长的一天终于落幕。此刻，他心中唯一的念头就是回家，沉入梦乡，将一切杂念抛诸脑后。步出那扇深棕色、令人心生敬畏的大门，他环顾四周，发现总有其他孩子朝着有趣的地方前行，打破了这片本应宁静的氛围。

Shinji started to walk in the direction of his house but with every single step his mind would get more and more engulfed in thought. Did he really want to go in that direction? What if Asuka saw him?  
真嗣开始往家的方向走，但每迈出一步，思绪就愈发沉浸。他真的想走这条路吗？如果明日香看到他怎么办？

That escaped his mind pretty easily as he saw Asuka leaning against a pole just down the block. Shinji quickly surveyed the area for any kind of an escape. The road was overflowing with cars each going probably faster then they should have. With crossing the road as an unfortunately unfeasible passage to escape, Shinji bit his lip and was wondering whether or not just turning around and walking in the opposite direction was the best option.  
当他看到明日香在不远处靠着一根柱子时，之前的念头便烟消云散了。真嗣急忙四下张望，寻找逃脱的机会。马路上车水马龙，每辆车都疾驰而过。考虑到横穿马路不切实际，真嗣咬紧嘴唇，犹豫着是否应该掉头朝反方向走。

When he turned around he saw the unmistakable figure of Rei, who must have been walking home as well, in his direction. If he turned around and Asuka saw him with her, even walking different directions, she would never forgive him.  
他一转身，便看到了 Rei 那熟悉的身影，显然她也是正往家走，朝着他的方向。倘若 Asuka 看到他和 Rei 在一起，哪怕只是朝着相反的方向行走，她也绝不会原谅他。

Although even then, he didn't know if she was going to without that particular fuck up.  
即便到了那时，他也不敢肯定她是否会因那次特别糟糕的错误而离去。

Shinji, without any other possible plan of action decided to just keep going forward any pray to which ever god was paying attention. Asuka was standing against a lamp pole that curved at the end, giving the illusion of a mourning figure. Shinji greatly felt for the thing. It looked like one of the more classical kinds, unlike all the ultra modern things which this city without a soul was filled with.  
真嗣别无他法，只能继续前行，默默祈祷有哪位神明能注意到他。明日香倚着一根末端弯曲的路灯杆，身影宛如一位哀悼者。真嗣对此感同身受。这路灯杆颇具古典韵味，与这座缺乏灵魂的城市中那些极尽现代的事物形成鲜明对比。

Asuka was still wearing her school uniform, as she was when she had gone to Shinji's place. This probably ruled out that she had gone home. She had never liked that uniform and given an opportunity would have probably changed out of it. Plus she always found that the skirt was too short, but kept shortening it so Shinji would always be staring at her. This was something Shinji always obliged.  
明日香依旧穿着去真嗣家时的校服，这似乎说明她并未回家。她向来不喜欢这套校服，若有机会定会换下。她总嫌裙子太短，却故意将其改得更短，只为让真嗣目不转睛。而真嗣对此总是欣然接受。

She looked at her small wrist watch, as if obviously expecting him. Shinji wondered how she was hoping he was going to greet her. If he just continued bowing and saying that he was sorry, that wouldn't probably sit well with her. She always told him to grow some balls and stand straight when doing it.  
她盯着小巧的腕表，显然在等他。真嗣思索着她期待怎样的问候。如果他只是不停地鞠躬道歉，恐怕难以令她满意。她常告诫他要拿出点勇气，鞠躬时也要挺直腰板。

He doubted she meant when talking to her in a situation like this.  
他怀疑她在这种场合下跟她交谈时，是否真的表达了那个意思。

As the gap finally disappeared between them Shinji decided that he had no choice but to greet her. Without any plan in his head, he just kind of decided to wing it. "Hey Asuka!" he greeted speeding up right up to her.  
随着两人间的距离终于消失，真嗣意识到不得不向她打招呼。脑中并无计划，他决定即兴应对。“嘿，明日香！”他加快步伐，追上她并打招呼。

Her head never turned though, and her expression never turned into anything other then frightfully neutral. Shinji wondered why this was. When he was finally in ear shot Asuka barely muttered loud enough, but just enough for Shinji to make out the words. "Why did you look so scared when you first saw me?"  
她的头始终未曾转动，表情也一直维持着一种令人不安的中性。这让真嗣感到困惑。当他终于能听清时，明日香几乎是用刚好能让真嗣听见的音量低语：“你初次见我时，为何显得那么惊恐？”

Shinji was taken aback and for the life of him, could just not get how that was possible. There was no way she could have seen him do that. Without any idea of a way to escape from this, Shinji finally just bit his lip, hung his head, and said that he was sorry.  
真嗣大吃一惊，百思不得其解，她怎么可能目睹那一幕。他无计可施，最终咬紧嘴唇，垂下头，低声道歉。

Asuka's expression changed then, to one of fury. She grabbed him by the shoulders, turned one hundred and eighty degrees, and pinned him against the pole she had been leaning on. "You kiss another girl, you act like you don't need me at all, and then you resort to acting the way I always told you not to!" She was whispering in his ear this, but it had to be the loudest he had ever heard anybody whisper in his life. "Why are you so intent on doing this?" this time he looked straight into her eyes, that had the fury of a thousand suns.  
明日香的脸色骤然变得愤怒。她抓住他的肩膀，猛地转身一百八十度，将他压在她之前倚靠的柱子上。“你亲吻其他女孩，表现得仿佛根本不需要我，接着又做出我一再警告你不要做的事！”她在他耳边低语，但那声音之大，他从未听过有人能如此大声地耳语。“你为何非要这么做？”这一次，他直视着她那如同千阳般炽烈的眼睛。

It was the scariest thing he had ever seen.  
那件事是他所见过的最令人胆战心惊的。

Then, was also when he noticed Rei walk by, looking at the two of the peculiarly. Asuka, noticing Shinji's changed expression and that he was looking at something else, turned her head as well. The second she saw Rei her expression changed suddenly.  
就在那时，他注意到绫波经过，用一种异样的目光打量着他们俩。明日香察觉到真嗣表情的变化，发现他正看向别处，便也转过头去。一见到绫波，她的表情顿时变了。

She with one arm grabbed Shinji's head and pulled him towards her. The other grabbed his hand and moved it to her ass. It was then that she kissed him, hard. Shinji was so surprised he couldn't think of anything to do but go along with it. They made out for a couple of seconds, till Rei was out of site.  
她单手抓住真嗣的头，用力将他拉近，另一手则牵引他的手触碰自己的臀部。随即，她热烈地吻了上去。真嗣惊愕不已，一时无措，只能被动接受。两人的亲吻持续了片刻，直到绫波的身影消失在视线之外。

When Shinji saw Asuka pull away he was surprised, they had barely been at it. He looked at her face expecting to see a smiling face, looking straight into his eyes. Shinji was let down a little bit. She wasn't looking at him at all. She was looking at the direction Rei had just been walking, with a smirk on her face. Like one she had when a devious plan had just come together, and Shinji just snapped.  
真嗣看到明日香突然抽身，感到十分惊讶，毕竟他们才刚刚开始。他期待着看到她笑脸盈盈，直视自己的眼睛。然而，真嗣有些失望，因为明日香根本没有看他。她的目光紧随着丽刚刚离去的方向，脸上挂着一丝狡黠的笑容，仿佛某个阴谋已经得逞，这让真嗣瞬间怒火中烧。

And he slapped her in the face.  
他随后给了她一个耳光。

Asuka stared horrified at Shinji, but he didn't care. He pushed her off him as quickly as he could. He did it a little too hard though as she fell onto the side walk, still totally dumbfounded. "What the fuck was that?" he yelled, loudly, but that didn't matter to him, not then.  
明日香惊恐地瞪着真嗣，他却无动于衷。他急忙将她从自己身上推开，用力过猛，使她摔倒在人行道上，依旧一脸茫然。“这到底是怎么回事？”他大声质问，但这在他看来已无关紧要。

"You just decide to kiss me, to finally have human contact, not because you feel anything, just because you wanted to show another girl to stay away from 'your man!'" He yelled. He walked right up to her who now actually seemed scared, genuinely scared of him. "You question my loyalty only because I don't do everything you want me to! What about you? When was the last fucking time you didn't do something for me just out of kindness, just because you liked me?  
你突然决定吻我，不过是为了满足对人的接触的渴望，并非出于情感，而是为了向另一个女孩示威，让她远离'你的男人！'他怒吼着。他逼近她，此刻她真的显得害怕了，对他感到由衷的恐惧。'你质疑我的忠诚，仅仅因为我没有完全按照你的意愿行事！那么你呢？你上一次不是出于义务，而是单纯因为喜欢我而为我做事，又是什么时候？

"Every fucking time you do anything you act like you're looking after me! Like I'm your responsibility and that if it wasn't for you I would never be able to do anything!" Shinji's fury had barely in broken, but Asuka was crying now, she wasn't doing it subtly either. "You ever think that I am just a human being you want to be around, not some fucking burden you have to carry wherever you go.  
"每次你做任何事都表现得像是在照顾我一样！好像我是你的责任，如果没有你，我就什么都做不了！" 真嗣的怒火还未完全爆发，但明日香已经在哭了，她并没有掩饰。"你有没有想过，我只是你想要陪伴的人，而不是你走到哪里都必须背负的负担。

"I am sick and tired of being pushed around by you. And this! This! I'm tired of being used by you. Just because you want some poor sap to control! Not because you. Not because you ever felt shit! This was the last time. No more. Just leave me the fuck alone.  
我真是受够了你的摆布。还有这些！这些！我厌倦了被你利用。只因为你想要找个可怜虫来操控！不是因为你。不是因为你有过任何感受！这是最后一次。别再烦我了。

"Bitch!" 混蛋！

and with that Shinji stormed off. He didn't help her up, or even looked back. In all honesty he did not really care.  
就这样，真嗣怒气冲冲地离开了。他没有扶她起身，甚至头也没回。坦白说，他其实并不在意。

He walked home without wasting a single second. Only when he got to his apartment building did he ever turn around. He was not surprised though that he saw nobody there. That was also the last thing he wanted to see. Life, he was sick of the idea of someone else. All he wanted was there only to be him, alone, with no one else.  
他一刻不停地走回家，直到抵达公寓楼前才回头一瞥。意料之中，那里空无一人，这正是他最不愿见到的。生活，他已厌倦了有他人的存在。他只渴望独处，只有自己，不希望有任何人打扰。

All his life he had been afraid of being alone. That was all he had known though for so long. Every action he did ended with him alone. He was shy, and stayed to himself, never ventured out. Till all he knew was himself, where he was, and that alone was nicer.  
他一生都在恐惧孤独。这是他长久以来的全部认知。无论做什么，最终都是独自一人。他性格内向，总是独处，从不踏出舒适圈。直到他所熟悉的只有自己，他的所在，而这种孤独感竟变得更为宜人。

That was when he met Asuka, who was over the top, out going more then anyone else Shinji had known and for some reason she had become obsessed with him. Always wanting to hang out with him, be near him, get him to change his ways; so she could be with him more.  
就在那时，他遇见了明日香，她性格张扬，比真嗣所知的任何人都更爱交际，不知何故，她对他产生了浓厚的兴趣。她总是想和他一起出去，靠近他，试图改变他的习惯，以便能更多地陪伴在他身边。

It always seemed more like a game she was playing that she had never gotten bored of. No one could ever actually feel something for him. It was all just a lie. He was just another part of something that he had no control over, because a piece can't play the player.  
这仿佛是她从未厌倦的一场游戏。没人能真正对他动情。一切不过是谎言。他不过是无法掌控的某个事物中的一环，毕竟棋子无法左右玩家。

He was sick of it. He was sick of it all! All he felt like doing was just closing himself into his own room and throwing away the key. It was safer there, it was quieter, he knew it was better, and most of all he couldn't get hurt there.  
他对这一切感到厌倦至极！只想把自己锁进房间，丢掉钥匙。那里更安全、更宁静，他深知这样更好，最重要的是，在那里他不会受到任何伤害。

When he had entered his house there was no one there. There was a small message written on a ripped piece of paper on a counter in his kitchen but he didn't care. Nothing really mattered to him right now. All he could think about was his room, everything else in his apartment was just junk on the path to his room.  
他踏入家门，屋内空荡荡的。厨房台面上，一张撕破的纸条上潦草地写着几句话，他却视而不见。此刻，他的心无旁骛，只念着他的房间，其余的，不过是通往房间路上的杂物罢了。

As he opened the door, his face changed, his emotions moved. He was finally safe, from this god forsaken world. Here though, all he could think about was what he had just done and how everything was ruined. Without anything knowledge of what to do, he just fell apart. All of his support was gone, his legs gave way and he fell to the ground. Without anything else to do he cried for about two hours and after that he fell asleep on his bed for another two.  
开门的那一刻，他的表情骤变，情绪起伏不定。他终于逃离了这个被神遗弃的世界，感到一丝安全。然而，他的思绪却被刚刚发生的事情和一切的毁灭所占据。茫然无措中，他彻底崩溃了。失去了所有的支撑，双腿一软，他瘫倒在地。无助之下，他痛哭了两个小时，随后在床上沉睡了两个小时。

He was awoken from this state of perpetual self hate by the phone ringing. Shinji, who had had no footing as of right now in reality, just stared at it for the first three rings. By the third though, something had awoken within him, something that had been sleeping: his confidence. He grabbed the phone and answered "hello?"  
电话铃声将他从持续的自我厌恶中惊醒。真嗣，此时在现实中尚未找到立足点，只是呆望着电话响了三声。然而，第三声响起时，他内心沉睡的某种东西觉醒了：那是他的自信。他迅速拿起电话，应答道：“喂？”

"Yo man!" yelled Touji from the other line. Shinji could barely make out his voice, he was obviously outside on his cell phone. "Dude! We're going to central park. You should totally come too!"  
嘿，兄弟！" 图基在电话那头大声说道。真嗣勉强能听到他的声音，显然他是在户外用手机通话。"伙计！我们要去中央公园。你绝对应该一起来！

Shinji wondered for a couple of seconds as to whether or not this was a smart move. He just kind of wanted to sleep. "Who is we?" he asked, might as well find out who is there.  
真嗣犹豫了片刻，思索这决定是否明智。他其实只想睡觉。“我们指的是谁？”他问道，不如先弄清楚在场的人。

Touji didn't seem to have heard him as he was laughing a little too hard on the phone. Shinji was just about to repeat himself, but Touji interrupted with his response. "It's me, Kensuke and a bunch of kids from the other classes from the school. I don't even really know how I got invited, or got Kensuke to come, but trust me, it's crazy!"  
冬二似乎没听到真嗣的话，他在电话那头笑得有些忘形。真嗣正打算再说一遍，冬二却抢先回应：“是我、剑介，还有学校其他班的一些同学。我都不太明白自己怎么被邀请的，又是怎么把剑介带来的，但相信我，现场真是热闹非凡！”

There was something different in his voice, Shinji could tell. "Dude are you drunk?" he asked, knowing what would probably be his answer.  
他的声音透露出异样，真嗣一听便知。“兄弟，你是不是喝多了？”他问，心中已隐约猜到答案。

"Man, not only that but stoned more then, well, a stone bitch!" Touji told him. "I also got a joint here with your name on it dude. Literally actually, I don't really know how it got started but someone had a magic marker but it was too big, I'll tell you story when you come. We betted as to whether you would actually come or not. I mean, like if Asuka would ever let you go. I put a lot of fucking money on you, so you better come. See you in like 15 minutes, Central Park, I love you man, like too much!" with that he hung up his phone.  
"兄弟，不仅如此，我还比石头还硬，真的，比石头婊子还硬！" 东治对他说。"我这儿还有根大麻烟，上面真写着你的名字。起因挺逗的，有人拿了支大号魔术笔，你来了我再细说。我们打赌你到底会不会来，就看明日香会不会放你一马。我可是押了不少钱在你身上，你可得来啊。15 分钟后，中央公园见，太想你了，真的！" 说完，他挂了电话。

Shinji just kind of sat there for a couple of seconds with the phone still in his hand. He put it down slowly thinking as to whether or not to come. Given any other day or situation he would never come. It was just that line "if Asuka would ever let you go." That kind of struck a chord right now. Maybe it was time to show them all that he actually lived his life according to himself, not what she said.  
真嗣呆坐片刻，手中电话未曾放下。他慢慢将其搁置，心中犹豫是否应前往。若非今日，若非此情此景，他定不会考虑。然而，那句“若明日香肯放你一马”，此刻却深深触动了他。或许，是时候向众人展示，他的人生是自主的，不受她左右。

Without really giving it too much thought Shinji stood up and left his room. He grabbed his bag and was about to take that with him but decided not to, seeing as he probably would not need it.  
真嗣没怎么深思就站了起来，走出房间。他拿起书包准备带上，但想到可能并不需要，就决定不带了。

He noticed something inside of it though when he did pick it up. He opened the bag and took out the pictures of Asuka and Rei from the day before. He stared at the pictures, looked at how great their bodies were. Asuka had the better breasts in his opinion, but Rei was cuter, which was also a big thing.  
他拿起袋子时，察觉到里面有东西。打开后，他取出了前一天拍摄的明日香和绫波的照片。他仔细端详着照片，赞叹她们身材的完美。在他眼中，明日香的胸部更吸引人，而绫波则显得更加可爱，这一点同样重要。

Shinji stood there, and grabbed what was probably the sexiest picture of each and put them into his pants. Just as something to look at to make him feel better if he felt down during the night. Which Shinji would have betted on, had there been anyone else in the room to bet with.  
真嗣站在那儿，挑出每张可能最迷人的照片，揣进裤兜。只为在夜深人静、心情低落时，能拿出来看看，给自己一些慰藉。若房间里有旁人可赌，真嗣定会押注自己会这么做。

When he finished up with the pictures he moved to the front door. Before he left though he remembered the note on the counter and decided he should read it. The note basically said that his parents were going to be home late and no one other than Asuka was allowed in the place. Shinji just grabbed a pen and quickly wrote "me too" under his parent's note.  
处理完照片后，他走向前门。离开前，他记起柜台上的便条，便决定看一眼。便条上写着他的父母会晚归，除了明日香，其他人不得入内。真嗣顺手拿起笔，在父母的便条下匆匆写下“我也一样”。

As he left the house his doubt filled his stomach but decided that this was something he needed to prove to everyone, especially to himself. With that radiating through his mind and many encouraging words that he had to say to himself over and over again, he trudged through the street to his destination of the park.  
离家之际，疑虑如重石压心，但他决心要向所有人，尤其是自己证明这一点。心中回响着坚定的信念和反复自勉的话语，他步履沉重地穿过街道，向着公园的目的地进发。

When he got there he was really afraid that he was not going to be able to find them, seeing as Touji never actually told him where in the park was he to find them. The park was a pretty sizable place. He had to phone Touji twice to get there. Touji, was in absolutely no condition to give directions. If he was going to give this crowd anything, was that they knew where to hide.  
他到达后，内心充满了担忧，因为 Touji 并未明确告知他应该在公园的哪个角落寻找他们。公园面积颇大，他不得不两次拨通 Touji 的电话才得以抵达。当时的 Touji 状态不佳，无法提供清晰的指引。如果要说这群人有什么本事，那就是他们深谙藏匿之道。

As he got there Kensuke walked up to him and greeted him. He seemed to be in a better state then Touji was. Touji, when he saw Shinji yelled nonsense as loud as he could. He started to walk around receiving money from a decent amount of people who Shinji did not even recognize.  
健介到达后便走向他并打招呼，看起来精神状态比冬二要好。冬二一见到真嗣，便大声喊出一些无意义的词句。他开始四处走动，从一些真嗣从未见过的人那里收取钱财。

When Touji finished getting his money, he walked back to Shinji and gave Shinji a beer. Shinji just kind of stared at it for a bit before drinking it down. He had drunk beer before, but not with the sole goal of getting drunk. Right when he finished Touji had already started to light something in his mouth.  
东治取完钱后，回到真嗣身边，递给他一瓶啤酒。真嗣凝视片刻，随即一饮而尽。虽然他曾喝过啤酒，但这次并非只为买醉。真嗣刚喝完，东治已开始点燃嘴里的东西。

He inhaled a few times, before passing it to Kensuke. Kensuke stared at it a bit before inhaling a little bit. Afterwards he didn't cough and seemed pretty pleased with himself. Kensuke passed it to Shinji who did not even know how to hold it right. He did though put it to his mouth and inhale multiple times; this though was interrupted though by him coughing.  
他深吸了几口气，随后递给了健介。健介先是凝视了一会儿，才小心翼翼地吸了一口。之后他并未咳嗽，显得颇为自得。健介又将它传给了真嗣，真嗣连握持的姿势都不对。他尝试着将它放入口中，连续吸了几口，却被突如其来的咳嗽打断了。

Touji seeing this instantly started to laugh, almost manically. "Dude put your arms up," he told Shinji. Shinji just kind of stared at him for a second while coughing. Touji, smiled and demonstrated the difficult action of raising his arms. Shinji, without any better idea did as Touji said, and it did help, he thought.  
目睹此景，冬二顿时狂笑起来，几乎到了失控的地步。“哥们，把手举起来，”他对真嗣说。真嗣愣了一下，边咳嗽边看着他。冬二微笑着，演示了举起手臂这一费劲的动作。真嗣别无他法，便依言而行，感觉确实有所缓解。

The three of them stayed together for most of the time. Whenever anyone would come near them, they would usually just talk to Touji for a while, and then walk away. This continued for a couple of hours. Shinji couldn't lie and say he wasn't having a blast though.  
三人多数时间形影不离。若有旁人接近，往往只与冬二短暂交谈便离去，如此反复数小时。尽管如此，真嗣内心其实乐在其中。

It was just during kind of random looking around that Shinji realised something that he had not before. Rei was here too. She was on the complete other side of where the crowd was. Shinji lit a cigarette, that Touji insisted that if he smoked after a joint it would get him higher, and started walking towards her with more confidence then he knew he had.  
正是在随意环顾四周时，真嗣意外地发现了一个之前未曾留意的事实——绫波也在场。她站在人群的另一端。真嗣点燃了一支烟，这是东治强烈推荐的，声称抽完大麻后再抽烟能让人感觉更嗨，他带着连自己都未曾意识到的自信，迈步向她走去。

She was sitting at the trunk of a tree. It was an old one with more then just a few dead branches hanging onto little more then the tree's will to stay together. In this city there were few things that were old, this tree being one of the few. It had an eyrie beauty to it like how a dying tiger that refused to sit still and wait for the end had more courage to be counted. This gave a large contrast to Rei, who was young, cute and did not seem to care about things such as time.  
她坐在一棵老树的树干旁，树上挂着几根枯枝，全靠树的顽强意志才未散架。在这座城市，古老之物屈指可数，这棵树便是其中之一。它有一种凄凉的美，如同一只垂死的老虎，不甘心坐以待毙，更显出无畏的勇气。这与年轻的 Rei 形成鲜明对比，她青春可爱，似乎对时间流逝毫不在意。

As Shinji came up to her, she noticed him and made a small smile. She did not seem to be experiencing too much, which was a difference between her and everyone else. As Shinji got to her, he realised that he, in all reality, had no idea in the slightest what to say. Without any ideas as to what to do, he just sat next her and said "Hey."  
真嗣走近时，她察觉到了，脸上浮现出一抹浅笑。她似乎并未沉浸在太多情绪中，与周围人形成鲜明对比。真嗣来到她身旁，却发现自己根本不知道该说些什么。毫无头绪之下，他只是默默坐到她旁边，轻声打了个招呼：“嘿。”

Rei giggled a little bit and looked at him with an innocent smile "Hi. How's your girlfriend?" Shinji looked at her for a second, realising that the last time she had seen him was when he was making out with Asuka.  
丽轻声笑了笑，带着无辜的微笑望向他：“嗨，你女朋友还好吗？”真嗣瞥了她一眼，想起她上次见到他时，他正和明日香亲昵。

Shinji frowned for a second and looked at the ground, "right now, not my girlfriend," was all he could think to say. Rei seemed to actually smile a lot deeper then Shinji thought one could after something he didn't really think of as good news.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，低头望着地面，“现在，她不是我女朋友，”他只能想到这么说。绫波的笑容似乎更深了，超出了真嗣对这种并非好消息的事情后所能预料的笑容。

Noticing Shinji's slight discomfort Rei grabbed the cigarette from Shinji's mouth which he had forgotten was in there, and inhaled a bit. "Well what are you doing here, looking for rebound or something?" Rei asked, seriously, or at least that was all Shinji could read from her face.  
察觉到真嗣有些不自在，绫波从他嘴里抽出他忘记了的香烟，轻轻吸了一口。“你来这里做什么，是寻求慰藉吗？”绫波认真地问道，至少真嗣从她的表情中感受到的是这种严肃。

Shinji hesitated for a bit and started to panic, what did she want him to say? Yes or no? Without any other idea he could think of he replied simply "nope, just trying to exercise the freedom I could not before."  
真嗣犹豫片刻，心中慌乱，她究竟想听他如何回答？肯定还是否定？思来想去别无他法，他只好简单回应：“不，我只是想体验一下之前未曾拥有的自由。”

Rei seemed to accept this answer and dropped the subject entirely. The two of them talked for a good half an hour about ideals. It was something that was a little alien to Shinji, personal communication was not something he did too often. The stooge's conversations were usually on random, generally nerdy topics and his conversations with Asuka were usually, well usually they didn't have conversations, just each other's company.  
丽似乎接受了这一回答，彻底不再提及此事。两人围绕理想畅谈了半个多小时，这对真嗣而言颇为陌生，他并不习惯进行深入的个人交流。与替身机器人的闲聊多是无聊且书呆子气的话题，而与明日香之间，往往并没有真正的对话，只是默默相伴。

After the half an hour Shinji got up and grabbed the two of them some drinks from this large pack of assorted alcoholic drinks some random guy Shinji had thought he might have seen maybe once or twice before. It took him a little longer then he had expected as these two guys had made him take two shots of whiskey.  
半小时后，真嗣站起来，从一大包各式酒精饮料中为两人取了些饮品，这些饮料来自一个真嗣隐约记得似乎见过一两次的男子。因为那两人让他连喝了两杯威士忌，所以比预期多花了些时间。

As he got back he noticed that Rei was staring at him differently. Shinji sat back next to her and smiled. He was about to ask her about her changed expression when around three other people sat down with him and they all shared a couple joints. When they were finished the other people sat up and walked away. Shinji, noticing a pack of cigarettes slightly hanging out of one of their back pockets grabbed it, decided the person wouldn't need it.  
他回来时，发现绫波正用一种异样的目光注视着他。真嗣坐回她身旁，微笑着。正要开口询问她表情变化的原因，突然又有三个人坐过来，大家一起抽了几根大麻烟。结束后，其他人起身离去。真嗣瞥见其中一人后裤袋里露出的半包香烟，便顺手取走，心想那人大概用不着了。

This was really kind of going weird. Shinji was loosing himself without really knowing why. This was the first time he had ever had weed, and taking as much as he had, probably was not a very good idea. At least he wasn't freaking out and acting like a total ass, like Touji was. Shinji was surprised no one had punched Touji yet.  
这情况确实有点诡异。真嗣在不知不觉中迷失了自我，却不知缘由。这是他首次尝试大麻，而且吸食过量，显然不是明智之举。还好他没有像东治那样惊慌失措，表现得像个彻头彻尾的混蛋。真嗣纳闷怎么还没人给东治一拳。

He finally looked at Rei, who was looking at him with the most seductive stare Shinji had ever seen. All of her clothes seemed loose and there was sweat moving down her brow. She just stared at him for a couple of seconds while Shinji's eyes kind of moved all over her. Shinji, just swallowed hard and hoped that someone, potentially him, would make a move.  
他最终将目光投向了绫波，她正以他前所未见的魅惑眼神回望着他。她身上的衣物显得宽松，汗水沿着她的额头滑落。她凝视着他，持续了几秒钟，而真嗣的视线不由自主地在她的身上徘徊。真嗣艰难地咽了咽口水，内心期盼着，无论是谁，哪怕是自己的行动。

Rei, though, did exactly that, but not even in the slightest close to what Shinji had been hoping for. "So, what is the story behind you and Asuka?" she asked with almost each word acting like a small dagger stabbing Shinji.  
然而，绫波丽的确那样做了，却与真嗣的期望大相径庭。“那么，你和明日香之间到底有什么故事？”她问道，每个字都仿佛一把小刀，刺痛着真嗣的心。

Shinji had been staring at her chest at that very moment, when he heard her say that though his head shot up and stared her in the eyes. He bit his lip as the thoughts of Asuka came rushing back into his head.  
就在那一刻，真嗣原本正盯着她的胸部，但听到她的话后，他猛地抬头，直视她的双眼。他咬着嘴唇，心中涌起了对明日香的思念。

What he had done today.  
他今天做了什么。

How he had been acting towards her.  
他对待她的行为举止。

What he had just been thinking of about another girl.  
他刚才正想着关于另一个女孩的事。

His lip, under the strain of his teeth even started to bleed. Tears kind of built up in his eyes. For some reason he couldn't fight them off at all. In his attempt to fuck himself up enough to forget all of this, just left him defenceless.  
他的嘴唇在牙齿的紧咬下甚至开始渗血。泪水在他的眼眶中逐渐积聚，不知为何，他完全无法抑制。他试图通过自残来忘记这一切，结果却让自己变得毫无防备。

Rei who had still had her seductive and fun face was greatly surprised by his response. Her face instantly switched to one of concern. She moved her arm to touch him, to try to console whatever was wrong. Out of instinct he just swatted it away. After a minute of just staring at him she asked "what the fuck happened?"  
丽原本还带着那副诱人又俏皮的神情，却被他的回答惊得目瞪口呆。她的脸色瞬间转为忧虑，伸手想要抚慰他，却被他本能地挡开。沉默地凝视了他片刻后，她忍不住问：“到底怎么了？”

Shinji, was kind of taken out of his trance by this. All he could think to say was "Me." Shinji just started to panic then, and jumped on top on Rei. He stared into her eyes, grabbed her right breast and kissed her on the mouth.  
真嗣被这突如其来的情况惊醒，一时语塞，只吐出一个“我”字。随即，他慌乱起来，跳到绫波身上，凝视着她的眼睛，抓住她的右胸，并吻上了她的唇。

Rei almost panicked, and pushed him off of her. She didn't run away though, she just kind of rolled on top of him. "You have to take it a little slower," she whispered in his ear and kissed him gently on the lips.  
丽差点慌了神，一把将他推开。然而她并未逃离，而是顺势翻到他身上。“你得慢点来，”她轻声耳语，随后温柔地吻了他的唇。

There was still something in the back of Shinji's mind though that couldn't escape. He had tears build up in his eye lids, and said "I can't promise that I might not go back to her."  
然而，真嗣心中总有种难以摆脱的感觉。泪水在他的眼眶中打转，他坦言：“我无法承诺不会再次回到她身边。”

"Don't think I won't go down without a fight," Rei whispered. And they continued as they were. In the next minutes it went only a little further with the kisses a little more open and Shinji gently groping her.  
"别以为我会轻易放弃，" 绫波轻声细语。接下来的几分钟，他们的亲吻愈发大胆，真嗣也温柔地抚摸着她。

The two of them would have probably stayed like that had Touji never intervened. He ran up to them and threw Rei off from on top of Shinji. "Slow down there lover boy, what the fuck do you think you're doing?" Touji asked. Shinji, angered by this tried to get up but Touji just pushed him back down.  
若非东治介入，他们或许会一直僵持不下。他快步上前，将丽从真嗣身上拉开，厉声问道：“悠着点，你这是在搞什么名堂？”真嗣怒火中烧，欲起身却被东治再次按倒。

"What about Asuka? You just forgot about her?" Touji asked Shinji, with his voice raised. There was something different about his eyes. His actions were for sure affected by the alcohol and recreational drugs, but there was a passion there. Something Shinji could not honestly say he had seen before in Touji.  
"那明日香怎么办？你难道把她忘了吗？" 东治提高声音质问真嗣，眼神中透露出不同寻常的光芒。尽管酒精和药物影响了他的行为，但其中蕴含的热情却是真嗣前所未见的。

Shinji just got more upset by this. He got up quickly and cleanly, as if he was not as out of his mind as he was. Staring at Touji's face he said plainly "That is none of your fucking business."  
真嗣因此愈发恼火。他迅速起身，动作干净利落，似乎并未像之前那样失控。他直视着东治，语气平淡地说：“这跟你没半毛钱关系。”

Touji, did not seem very pleased by this response. "Not my fucking business? Me and her may not be on the best terms, hell I can barely stand her but there is one thing I know. She has done more then enough to deserve you, and more then enough to deserve better than this!" Touji ran up and pushed Shinji who lost his balance but did not fall.  
冬二对这个回答显然很不高兴。"关我屁事？我和她关系虽不怎么样，甚至我都有点受不了她，但有一点我明白。她为你做的已经够多了，也配得上更好的！"冬二冲上去推了真嗣一把，真嗣踉跄了一下，但没有倒下。

This little confrontation seemed to be attracted people. More and more people started to circle around them to see what this was about. "Deserve me? Am I just an object to be won once you do enough for it? I'm a human being, who deserves more then to be played around with. You told me today that she wouldn't let me come, she probably wouldn't have, but I have come because I could, because I am a person capable of free will. All she ever wanted from me was someone to control and put down. She didn't deserve me, because first she would have had to have cared for me!"  
这场小冲突似乎吸引了人们的目光。越来越多的人围了上来，好奇地想知道发生了什么。"配得上我？难道我只是一个你付出足够多就能赢得的奖品吗？我是一个有尊严的人，不应该被随意摆布。你今天告诉我她不会让我来，她可能真的不会，但我还是来了，因为我有这个能力，因为我是一个有自主权的人。她想要的不过是一个可以操控和贬低的对象。她不配拥有我，除非她首先表现出对我的关心！"

Shinji ran up to Touji and tried to punch him, but even intoxicated Touji dodged it with ease. "Are you just fucking stupid? You ever think that that is the only way she knows how to communicate with people! The only reason she stayed with you for so long was because you accepted her, she could act naturally and you would be fine with it. Not every fucking thing is because of you. She needed, no, needs someone who will always be there with her, and you just fucking start making out with the next whore who would do you.  
真嗣冲向东治，试图挥拳相向，然而醉酒的东治却轻松闪避。“你是不是脑子进水了？你可曾想过，那是她与人沟通的唯一方式！她能与你长久相伴，全因你接纳了她，她得以自在表现，而你亦能接受。并非事事都与你有关。她需要，不，是需要一个始终陪伴她的人，而你却转而与下一个愿意与你亲昵的女子纠缠。

"The fastest is not always the best, and human lives are a more delicate balance then you could accept."  
速度最快未必就是最佳选择，人类生活的平衡远比你想象的要微妙得多。

Rei now was angry. She walked right up to Touji and slapped him on the face, so hard that he fell to the ground. "I am not some fucking whore you shit face!" she then started to kick in the stomach repeatedly.  
丽此刻怒火中烧。她直奔东二，猛地给了他一记耳光，力道之大让他跌坐在地。"别把老娘当成你嘴里的那种贱货！"随后她连连踢向他的腹部。

Confused by all of this Shinji ran up and grabbed her. Angry by this she easily wormed out of his arms. She slapped him across the face hard as well, but not as hard as she did for Touji. Shinji limped away for a second before she walked back up to him and kissed him on the lips. She muttered an apology and walked behind him. Shinji turned to join her but Touji, who had somehow gotten back up while the others were busy grabbed him and threw him to the ground.  
真嗣被这一切弄得晕头转向，冲上前抓住了她。她因愤怒而轻易地从他怀中挣脱，给了他一记耳光，虽不及对冬二那般狠厉。真嗣踉跄后退，她随即上前吻了他的唇，低声道歉后，便走到他身后。真嗣正要转身跟随，不料冬二趁众人分心之际，不知怎么又站了起来，一把将他摔倒在地。

"Dude she may not admit it, or openly show it, but Asuka cares more for you than anyone else I have ever known. More than Hikari has ever for me! Now here you are just slapping her across the face much harder then that bitch did to me!" Touji was steaming with rage. Touji grabbed Shinji by the shirt and lifted him up to his feet.  
"兄弟，她或许不会承认，也不会明说，但明日香对你的在乎，我敢说，比我所知的任何人都深。甚至超过了光对我的感情！可你呢，现在却狠狠地给了她一巴掌，比那女人打我时还要狠！" 东治怒火中烧，一把揪住真嗣的衣领，将他提了起来。

"If she cares so much for me, then please, please explain to me, why ever action she does for me she acts like it is doing a chore. As if she didn't look after me then every part of my life would crumble! She doesn't care for me, more then she would a house that needs sweeping!" Shinji spit in Touji's face but stumbled right afterwards, almost falling to the ground.  
"如果她真的那么在乎我，那请解释一下，为何她为我做的每件事都像是在应付差事。仿佛她若不照顾我，我的生活就会支离破碎！她对我的关心，不过就像是对待一间需要打扫的房子罢了！" 真嗣向冬二脸上吐口水，但随即脚步不稳，险些跌倒。

Touji grabbed Shinji by the arm and stabilized him. "Because when the fuck has anything she done for you not a chore? Your life is so sad that she is convinced that would happen. And what's happened now that you have went out on your own? When was the last time you also asked her for something else? Asked her on a date? Asked for something fucking else?" From Touji's face it seemed like he was starting to lose himself. He was in no condition to be having this argument. "I'm not going fucking let you hurt her! Where is that fucking honour you always said you have now?"  
冬二紧紧抓住真嗣的手臂，稳住他。"想想看，她为你做的哪件事不是负担？你的生活如此凄凉，她都预料到了。现在你独立了，情况如何？你上次向她索求别的东西是什么时候？有没有约她出去？或者索要其他什么？"冬二的脸色表明他快要失控了。此刻的他并不适合争论。"我不会让你伤害她的！你一直标榜的荣誉感现在何处？"

Touji pushed Shinji back down onto the ground and picked him up by his shirt collar till he was just above Touji's waist. Shinji's expression changed then to one of horrified realisation. Tears started flowing down his face like a river. He moved his lips, and tried his hardest to talk "But, but I've already hurt her! I've already fucking hurt her! I, I, I slapped her across her face, and, and I threw her to the ground!" He looked at Touji's face and just couldn't stop the tears from coming.  
冬二将真嗣推倒在地，揪住他的衣领将他提起，使其身体略高于自己的腰部。真嗣的表情顿时转为惊恐的觉悟。泪水如泉涌般流淌。他努力张开嘴唇，竭力说道：“可是，我已经伤害了她！我真的伤害了她！我，我，我打了她的脸，还把她推倒在地！”他望着冬二的脸，泪水无法抑制地涌出。

Touji punched him in the face.  
冬二给了他脸上一拳。

And again. 又一次。

And again. 又一次。

He probably only stopped because Rei jumped onto his back and started to yell at him to stop. The crowd, which at this point was pretty much everyone there walked in between the two of them to stop it. Kensuke walked up to Shinji who was lying on the ground as if he were unconscious.  
他之所以停下，很可能是因为丽跳上他的背并开始大声呵斥。此时，几乎在场的所有人都围了上来，他们站到两人之间，制止了这场冲突。健介走向躺在地上，看似失去意识的新二。

Shinji did not really know what specifically happened afterwards. Touji stormed off to probably throw rocks at Hikari's window screaming "STELLA!" Rei checked up on Shinji and then walked home. Kensuke put one of Shinji's arms over his shoulder and the two of them walked back to Shinji's place.  
真嗣对之后发生的事情并不十分清楚。东治怒气冲冲地离开，可能是去向光的窗户扔石头，并高声呼喊“斯黛拉！”绫波过来关心了一下真嗣，随后独自回家。剑介则扶着真嗣的一只胳膊，两人一同返回了真嗣的住处。

The two of them only took one break to smoke one of the cigarettes that Shinji had stolen. Kensuke described how he didn't really like them very much, but that they were really cool.  
他们俩仅休息了一次，抽了真嗣偷来的其中一支烟。健介坦言自己其实不太喜欢抽烟，但认为这样做挺酷的。

When they got to Shinji's building, Shinji had much more trouble opening the lock to get in then he thought was possible. Shinji insisted that he could make it to his own apartment alone but Kensuke repeatedly said that he would at least walk Shinji to his door. Shinji, was in no condition to argue with him and agreed.  
当他们抵达真嗣的住处时，真嗣惊讶地发现开锁进门的难度远超预期。尽管真嗣坚称自己能独自回公寓，健介却坚持至少要陪他到门口。真嗣此时无力反驳，只好同意。

As they got to the elevators they made the unlucky discovery that the two elevators were out of order. Shinji just kind of swore loudly and banged his fists against the doors for a minute before the two started to climb the stairs. Something that both of them knew was going to go on for too long and be more painful than anything should be.  
当他们走到电梯前，却沮丧地发现两部电梯都坏了。真嗣忍不住大声咒骂，还用拳头敲打了几下电梯门，随后两人无奈地开始爬楼梯。他们心里清楚，这将是一段漫长且痛苦的攀登，远超常理。

When they neared Shinji's floor they had the great luck to run into two people who were probably the last they wanted to run into: Asuka and Hikari.  
当他们快要到达真嗣所在楼层时，偏偏碰上了最不愿遇见的两人：明日香和光。

Even though it was probably a confusing place for the two of them to be for Kensuke; Shinji knew exactly why they were there. He and her had been there many times.  
虽然对健介而言，这个地方或许令他们俩感到迷茫；但真嗣心里明白他们来此的原因。他和她曾多次造访此地。

One important thing to know about Asuka's life was that she had a very nosy and very protective mother. Whenever she would have anyone over, her mother would love to spy on her. Sometimes this was merely walking into Asuka's room without knocking, but with a viable excuse such as needing to grab something. A couple of times though Asuka and Shinji had found her mother actually trying to listen in.  
明日香生活中一个不容忽视的事实是，她的母亲既爱管闲事又极其保护欲强。每当有人来访，母亲总爱暗中观察。有时她会借口取物，未经敲门便进入明日香的房间，但有几次明日香和真嗣发现她母亲竟在偷听。

Asuka, then eventually decided that if there was anything she wanted to discuss, that she would not want her mother to know about, they would move into the stairs here to talk about it.  
明日香最终决定，若有什么不想让母亲知晓的话题，她们便会在此楼梯间私下讨论。

So after today's events it was no surprise that she was her, even this late at night. It was also no question as to what it was they wanted to discuss without her mother knowing: him.  
经历了今天的事情，她深夜仍在此地，已不足为奇。他们想背着她母亲谈论的，无疑就是他。

Things though, actually went better then they could have, as the first thing anyone said after they all say each other was "What the hell happened to him?" as Asuka almost ran to Shinji's less then perfect body, and mind.  
然而，事情的发展出乎意料地顺利。众人一碰面，脱口而出的第一句话便是：“他究竟遭遇了什么？”明日香急切地奔向真嗣那残缺不全的身躯与心灵。

Kensuke seemed pretty nervous right now, Shinji knew that he was conflicted as to how to act. "A lot of things," he tried to cover up. Kensuke probably did not want to say all of the details or at least he did not want to be the one to tell Asuka. That was going to have to be Shinji's responsibility, and Shinji knew it would probably be best if it were only those two when that conversation happened.  
健介此刻显得颇为紧张，真嗣明白他正纠结于如何应对。“很多事，”他试图搪塞过去。健介或许不愿透露所有细节，至少不想亲自向明日香说明。这责任将落在真嗣肩上，他清楚最好是在只有他们两人时再进行这场对话。

Asuka did not seem very pleased with that but she probably that it would be too much work to beat it out him. Shinji tried to just keep moving, to show that he was fine but he just lost balance and fell right into Asuka's arms.  
明日香对此似乎并不太高兴，但她可能认为为此与他争执太过麻烦。真嗣本想继续前行，表明自己无恙，却不料失去平衡，恰好跌进了明日香的怀里。

Hikari seemed to be an unconfident participant, as if she too had no idea how to act right now. Obviously the conversation the two of them had been having, was not suppose to end with Asuka helping out Shinji with every inch of her voice sounding concerned.  
光显得缺乏自信，似乎她也不清楚此时该如何应对。显然，他们两人的对话，原本不应以明日香用满是关切的语气帮助真嗣而结束。

Shinji without any better idea just said "Look, I'll just go to my place by myself."  
真嗣想不出更好的办法，只好说：“算了，我还是自己回去吧。”

There was a slight tension in the air after he had actually talked. Everyone around him seemed in thought for a minute. They needed a plan, or something along those lines. Asuka, who was never one for patience just said "Like hell you are, I'll walk you there. Fool,"  
他开口后，空气中略带紧张。周围的人似乎都陷入了短暂的沉思。他们急需一个计划，或类似之物。向来急躁的明日香直截了当地说：“别想了，我带你去。真是的。”

Kensuke and Hikari just kind of looked at each other and came to an unspoken agreement. The two of them nodded to Asuka and started down the stairs. Shinji could have sworn he heard Hikari ask "What happened?" as the two of them disappeared.  
健介和光相视无言，却心领神会。他们向明日香点头后，便一同下楼。真嗣确信自己听到光在他们身影消失时低声问：“到底怎么了？”

When they were finally gone Asuka moved his arm over her shoulder. She looked different, that was all that Shinji could figure out. Her eyes were slightly swollen and red. He wanted to just think about the possible things that could have led her to that, but he knew the second he looked at her that he was the fault.  
当众人离去后，明日香将手臂搭在她的肩上。她看起来有些异样，真嗣只能察觉到这一点。她的双眼略显肿胀，泛着红晕。他本想揣测导致她如此的种种可能，但一看到她，便明白这是自己的过失。

Even though they were only a couple of floors to Shinji's the stairs seemed to go on forever. They stretched and stretched until all Shinji could see was stairs. Deciding that he just didn't feel like going on, he almost just slivered through Asuka's grip to sit down. Asuka though, was not going to let this happen. She held onto his arm until she was almost carrying Shinji's full wait. She never wavered as well. Shinji could see it in her eyes like a fire. She was going to help him, because she was strong.  
虽然到真嗣那儿只需爬几层楼，但楼梯仿佛无穷无尽。它们不断延伸，直到真嗣眼前只剩下楼梯。他决定不再前行，几乎要从明日香的手中滑出，想要坐下。但明日香决不允许，她紧抓着他的手臂，几乎是在背负着真嗣的全部重量。她坚定不移。真嗣从她的眼中看到了决心，如同燃烧的火焰。她会帮助他，因为她很坚强。

And that's what strong people do, look after the weak.  
强者就是这样，会照顾弱小。

They got to Shinji's floor much quicker then it seemed to him and walked to his door. Asuka shook him to get him to grab his keys, but he was thinking or at least he was not paying attention to where he was, or what they were doing. Asuka was put off a bit by this and grabbed everything from his pocket. She shifted through the stuff for a second before she found the keys.  
他们比真嗣预想的更快到达了他的楼层，并走向他的房门。明日香摇晃他，提醒他拿钥匙，但他似乎心不在焉，没留意周围的情况。明日香有些不高兴，便伸手从他的口袋里掏出所有物品。她翻找片刻，终于找到了钥匙。

She fumbled with them, not knowing which one was the key to get in. She turned her head to ask Shinji about which one it was to get in, but he grabbed the keys out of her hand. He stood still and unlocked the door as if he was totally sober and unhurt.  
她手忙脚乱地摸索着钥匙，却分不清哪一把能开门。她刚想转头询问真嗣，他却一把从她手中接过钥匙。他静静地站在那里，动作流畅地开了门，仿佛一切如常，毫无醉意或伤痛。

When he opened it though, he walked in and was planning on just telling Asuka 'thank you' and close the door, but she sneaked in before he could. He really did not know what to do and was about to ask her something, anything, but she kept walking till she entered his room and closed the door.  
他开门进去，原本只想对明日香道声谢就关门，不料她趁机溜了进来。他一时不知所措，正想开口问她，她却径直走进他的房间，随手关上了门。

Shinji was confused by this but decided he was going to deal with that in a minute. The first thing he did was stumble to his kitchen and he drunk probably a litre of water to quench his dry throat.  
真嗣对这情况感到迷惑，但决定稍后再来应对。他首先跌跌撞撞地来到厨房，一口气喝下大约一升水，以解喉咙的干渴。

He walked into the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. His shirt and pants were covered in grass stains, his shirt had a small rip on the collar, his hair was a mess and he had a large black eye. Over all he looked like shit. He washed off his face with hot water and took off his ripped shirt. He put the shirt in the garbage can and just sat down for a second. Only the realisation that Asuka was in his room got him to get up.  
他步入浴室，凝视镜中狼狈的自己：衬衫和裤子沾满了草渍，领口处裂开一个小口，头发乱糟糟的，一只眼睛肿得发黑。整个人看起来一团糟。他用热水洗了洗脸，脱掉破损的衬衫，将其丢进垃圾桶，然后坐下稍作休息。直到意识到明日香在他的房间里，他才重新站起来。

The light in his room was on and he was afraid to open the door, but he knew he must, there was nothing else he could.  
他房间的灯光亮着，尽管害怕打开门，但他明白自己别无选择，必须这么做。

He walked to, each step taken carefully so he would not fall. Even though he was slightly starting to feel better he was still kind of dizzy.  
他小心翼翼地迈步前行，每一步都格外谨慎，以防跌倒。虽然他开始感到略有好转，但依旧有些晕眩。

Asuka was sitting on the floor opposite to him. She was wearing another shirt then the one she had had on when he had seen her before. She must have been wearing this shirt under the other one. This one was much tighter and hugged her skin showing off her curves. She was looking at two things in her hands, so Shinji had time to explore her with his eyes.  
明日香坐在他对面，身着一件与之前所见不同的衬衫，应该是之前那件下面还穿了这件。这件衬衫更为贴身，紧贴肌肤，完美勾勒出她的身形。她正专注地看着手中的两样物品，让真嗣得以趁机用目光细细端详她。

It was not long after though, that he realised what she was looking at. It was two pictures. He was not sure, but would have bet considerable money that it was the two he had put in his pocket before he had left that day. He checked his pocket to be sure and noticed that there was nothing in them. Asuka had taken everything out of that pocket when she had grabbed his keys. For some reason she seemed to be staring at them intently. "Hey?" was all Shinji could think to ask.  
不久后，他察觉到她在注视的东西。那是两张照片。他虽不确定，但几乎可以肯定，那正是他离开那天放进口袋的两张。他伸手摸了摸口袋，发现里面空空如也。原来，Asuka 在他取钥匙时，已经把口袋里的东西都掏空了。不知何故，她正聚精会神地盯着那些照片。“怎么了？”Shinji 脱口而出。

She looked up at him as if she had not even realised that he was in the room. She had though; she always knew everything that was going on, even if she did not show it. "Do you really think this of me?" she asked putting the pictures on the ground. "Your picture of Rei has her looking cute and smiling, while mine is just a picture of me wearing little clothing and slowing off my cleavage."  
她抬头望向他，似乎才察觉到他的存在。其实她一直心知肚明；她对周遭的一切总是洞察秋毫，即便不露声色。“你真的这么看待我吗？”她问道，将照片搁在地上。“你画的小玲显得既可爱又面带笑容，而我的那张，只是我衣着单薄、显露胸线的样子。”

Shinji honestly had never thought of it like that or consciously realised that that was how he thought. He quickly tried to construct excuses or something to get out of it. Nothing came to mind though, because, it was the truth, he had to admit it to himself. He wanted to tell her that but the words never came out of his lips. He just kind of stared at her with the most honest stare he could muster up. It was then that he realised he was shirtless and quickly started to try to find one.  
真嗣从未这样想过，也未曾意识到自己内心竟是如此。他急忙想找借口逃避，却什么也想不出来，因为，他不得不承认，这就是真相。他本想向她坦白，但话到嘴边却说不出口。他只能用最真诚的眼神凝视着她。这时，他才意识到自己没穿上衣，便急忙开始寻找。

Asuka frowned at this and grabbed Rei's photo. She whispered something to herself and ripped the photo up. "What happened to you today?" she asked with a real concern in her voice. "What happened to you?"  
明日香眉头紧锁，一把抓过绫波的照片。她喃喃自语，随后将照片撕得粉碎。“你今天是怎么回事？”她关切地询问，声音里满是真切的忧虑。“你究竟怎么了？”

Shinji kind of froze where he was and sat on his floor. He looked at her and said "I experienced fucking myself up."  
真嗣愣在原地，坐在地板上，望着她，低声说：“我感受到了自我毁灭的滋味。”

Asuka moved her right hand and grabbed her shoulder. "What exacting do you define as fucking yourself up? That is not a very precise term." Her hand started to massage her skin for reasons that Shinji had no idea of. All he knew was that she looked a little too good doing it.  
明日香挪动右手，搭在肩上。“你说的‘自毁’究竟指什么？这词儿太含糊了。”她开始揉捏自己的肌肤，动机不明，但真嗣只觉得她这动作格外撩人。

"Well I, probably drank too much, and I, well I tried getting high. It was really not too special." Shinji informed her; he was trying to act as cool as he could. He did not really know why but his thoughts were spiralling around in circles. He could not keep hold of a thought for too long as well. All he knew it was about her.  
"嗯，我可能喝多了，还尝试过嗨起来，但感觉也就那样。" 真嗣向她坦白，尽力保持酷酷的样子。他自己也不清楚为何思绪纷乱，难以集中。唯一清楚的是，这一切都与她有关。

Asuka did not really seem too impressed by that. "And where does the whole beating the shit out of you come in? Wanted to try doing that too tonight?" He was thinking of her body right then, but as she asked it he remembered what the situation was.  
明日香对此似乎并不太感兴趣。"那痛打你一顿又是怎么回事？今晚也想尝试一下吗？" 他当时脑海中正浮现她的身影，但她的提问让他想起了当下的情境。

"No, I did not do it. Touji did it," he told her. His first thought was to lie, but she deserved better. He needed to let her know. She seemed kind of angered by that. "Yeah, I guess he cares about you more then you would think." He right away kicked himself after saying that though. That had come out wrong.  
"不，那不是我做的，是冬二做的，"他向她坦白。起初他想撒谎，但觉得她值得更真诚的对待。他觉得有必要让她知道真相。她似乎对此感到有些恼火。"嗯，看来他比你所认为的更在乎你。" 话一出口，他立刻意识到说得不太妥当。

Asuka just looked a little disgusted by that. "What do you mean?"  
明日香脸上露出一丝厌恶。"你这话是什么意思？"

Shinji had to quickly come up with a plan, but just started talking without one. "No, no, not like that. It's just, well." He breathed in deeper then his lungs could. "We were at this park with a whole lot of people. Rei was there. We just kind of started making out, and, I was groping her too. Touji saw this and there was no way he was going to let me do that to you, so he intervened. We argued and he ended up doing this to me."  
真嗣本应迅速制定一个计划，却未及思索便开口了。"不，不，不是那样。只是，嗯。" 他深吸一口气，超出了肺部的极限。"当时我们在一个挤满人的公园里。绫波也在。我们开始亲热，我也在抚摸她。东治目睹了这一切，他绝不会容忍我对你这么做，于是他插手了。我们争执起来，最终他对我做出了这样的事。"

Asuka looked like a mixture of horrified, disgusted and totally betrayed. She stood up and started storming out of his room quickly but as she passed by him he grabbed her by the wrist. She slapped his hand off of her and got to the door. Without any other ideas Shinji just said simply "Don't leave me!" He had not even noticed when he had started to cry.  
明日香面露惊恐与厌恶，仿佛遭受了彻底的背叛。她猛地起身，快步向门外冲去，经过他时，他一把抓住了她的手腕。她用力甩开他的手，直奔门口。无计可施的真嗣只能简单地哀求：“别丢下我！”他甚至未察觉自己已泪流满面。

There were a couple of breaths of silence. Asuka just stood at the doorway. "Why?" she asked through a hoarse voice.  
沉默持续了几秒钟。明日香站在门口，用沙哑的声音问道：“为什么？”

Shinji stared at her. This time it was different though. It was not longer sexual, it was more then that. It was something Shinji had wanted to be able to do for a while. The problem was his voice who had now escaped his grasp. He wanted to tell her, tell her something, anything, but there was nothing there.  
真嗣凝视着她，这次的感觉截然不同。不再只是性吸引，而是更深层次的渴望。这是真嗣长久以来一直想做的事情。然而，他的声音却已不受控制。他渴望向她倾诉，哪怕只言片语，却发现自己无言以对。

There was a stillness that Shinji couldn't dream to touch. It was far beyond his reach. The only thing he could do was just watch her. "If I stay," Asuka started, "Would you promise to never look at that bitch again?"  
真嗣无法触及的是一种深邃的静谧。它遥不可及。他唯一能做的，只是默默地注视着她。“如果我留下，”明日香缓缓说道，“你能承诺不再看那个女人一眼吗？”

If there was anytime in Shinji's life where he wished he had the ability to lie to Asuka, it would be right then. Miracles are not given, only earned though and if there was one thing that Shinji had not done that night it was earn it. "I can't lie to you," he almost yelled to the ground. He could not even stand staring at her.  
如果真嗣一生中有那么一刻，他多么希望自己能对明日香撒谎，那便是此刻。奇迹并非凭空而来，只能靠努力赢得，而那一夜，真嗣并未努力争取。“我无法对你撒谎，”他几乎是对着地面喊出这句话。他甚至不敢直视她的眼睛。

"Why not?" Asuka asked, still in the doorway. She was no longer standing, her legs had just kind of melted away and she was crouching. Shinji had not expected this, he was confused. What did that mean? She turned around and looked at him. She walked right up to him and picked him up onto his feet.  
"为什么不呢？"明日香站在门口问道。她不再站着，双腿似乎失去了支撑，蹲了下来。真嗣对此毫无准备，感到困惑。这究竟是什么意思？她转过身，直视着他。随后，她走到他面前，将他扶起站稳。

She looked at him, straight through his eyes, and asked "Why can't you just humour me tonight?" Shinji tried to smile at this and made a feeble success.  
她直视着他的眼睛，问道：“为什么今晚你就不能迁就一下我呢？”真嗣努力挤出一个微笑，虽然有些勉强。

Asuka smiled though, deeply, right at him, almost hiding the tears in her eyes. No matter how he thought, he just wanted this moment, one of happiness to last. Asuka gently pushed him onto his bed. She took off her jeans and climbed on top of him. She leaned in and kissed him hard, long. It was their first real one and Shinji wouldn't have traded with anything.  
尽管明日香微笑着，眼神却深邃地凝视着他，眼角的泪光若隐若现。无论他如何思索，都渴望这一刻，这份幸福能永恒。明日香轻柔地将他推倒在床上，褪去牛仔裤，跨坐在他身上。她倾身吻他，热烈而持久。这是他们真正的初吻，对真嗣而言，无物可换。

The two of them fell asleep like that.  
他们俩就这样进入了梦乡。

And Shinji dreamed a dream like no other.  
随后，真嗣梦见了一个前所未有的梦境。

So, a long time in the making, here is chapter 3! I just want to start off by thanking all of the people who have reviewed this story. None of my other stories ever got as many as this one did, and as this is my most personal one, I really appreciated it. Thank you, and enjoy! (I've tried to make this one less depressing, lets hope it is)  
经过漫长的打磨，第三章终于与大家见面了！首先，我要向所有留下评论的读者表示衷心的感谢。这个故事获得的反响远超我其他作品，它对我而言意义非凡，你们的支持让我倍感温暖。感谢你们，愿你们享受阅读！（我努力让这一章不那么沉重，希望效果不错）

_I can't 我做不到  
get out 离开这里  
Of what I'm into 我热衷于什么  
with you  和你在一起_

Shinji shifted his head to the right to try and quell the pain. His head ached and pulsed, no hangover before came close to the one he was experiencing. Once he had opened his eyes all he could think of was pain. He had tried to get up initially. It seemed like a good idea to drink some water, eat some food or take some ibuprofen. Lying on the bed didn't appear like it would be an efficient way to try and combat the hangover. Unfortunately Shinji was not solely suffering from his drink related escapades, but also the literal beating he had taken the night before. Every muscle was sore, all movement hurt, he was trapped in a state of perpetual pain and discomfort.  
真嗣将头偏向右侧，试图减轻疼痛。他的头部剧烈疼痛，脉搏跳动，以往的任何一次宿醉都无法与之相提并论。睁开眼的那一刻，他满脑子都是疼痛。起初他试图起身，心想喝点水、吃点东西或服用布洛芬或许能有所帮助。然而，躺在床上似乎并不是对抗宿醉的有效方法。更糟的是，真嗣不仅因饮酒而痛苦，还因为前一晚遭受的实际打击。全身肌肉酸痛，一动就痛，他陷入了无休止的疼痛与不适之中。

Despite all of this Shinji felt himself in good spirits. It wasn't often he had a chance to sleep in the same bed as Asuka. He had only done it once before at a sleepover over eight years before. They had made a fort out of the sheets on Asuka's bed and the cushions from the couch. Asuka told the scariest stories she could think of, trying as hard as she could to make Shinji afraid. It worked fantastically, Shinji was too afraid to leave the fort. So the two of them slept in it together, and even though he'd never admit it, when Shinji had awoken the next morning the two of them had been holding hands.  
尽管如此，真嗣的心情却异常愉快。能与明日香同床共枕的机会实属难得。他只在八年前的一次睡衣派对上体验过一次。那时，他们用明日香的床单和沙发靠垫搭建了一个小堡垒。明日香讲着她能想到的最恐怖的故事，竭力想吓唬真嗣。效果出奇地好，真嗣害怕得不敢离开堡垒。于是，两人就在堡垒里共度了一夜，尽管他绝不会承认，但第二天清晨醒来时，他们竟是手牵着手。

Asuka was still asleep. Her diaphragm moved up and down slowly. Shinji's eyes were glued to it. There was something beautiful about such a simple action. The sun light crept through the only window of the room, illuminating everything ever so subtly. Shinji's penguin alarm clock stared at them like some kind of voyeur. Shinji didn't like to think of anyone watching them. Not because he was afraid of what they'd think, but rather because the moment was so personal. This was for him and Asuka, no one else mattered, and no one else had any claim to this situation.  
明日香仍在沉睡。她的膈肌缓慢地上下起伏。真嗣的视线无法从这上面移开。这个简单的动作竟显得如此美丽。阳光透过房间唯一的窗户，微妙地洒满四周。真嗣的企鹅闹钟仿佛在偷窥般注视着他们。真嗣不愿想象有人在旁观。并非出于对他人看法的担忧，而是因为这一刻太过私密。这是专属于他和明日香的，其他人无权介入，也无权分享这一刻。

This was bullshit and Shinji knew it. He kept trying to suppress what had occurred over the last two days but it always found a way back into his mind. How could he be such a fool? What was he a fool about? Could he have possibly acted in a different way? What about Rei?  
这纯属扯淡，真嗣心里清楚得很。他努力想把过去两天的事压下去，可这些念头总是阴魂不散地回到他脑中。他怎么就这么傻呢？究竟傻在哪儿？难道他还有别的选择吗？那绫波又该如何？

Even with Asuka laying on top of him, in the sexiest position imaginable, he couldn't help but wonder about Rei. She had been so forward with him. She really did actually want to be with him. Enough that she would challenge Asuka. That has to be worth something right? And she was cute, cute as a button.  
尽管明日香以最撩人的姿态压在他身上，他心中却始终惦记着绫波。她对他的主动是那么明显，她是真心想与他相伴，甚至敢于与明日香一争高下。这份心意，难道不值得珍视吗？何况她那般可爱，简直可爱至极。

But Shinji didn't want to think of that right then. At the moment he needed to think about Asuka. Her beautifully round breasts pressing softly against his arms. How her blood red hair shone in the light. She was pretty, prettier than Shinji could ever hope to explain. But he had failed her, hurt her, and he was going to have to live with that. Shinji's hands hurt from the night before, when he had attacked his best friend for trying to stand up for her. Was that something a nice person would do? Where was his much revered honour now?  
然而，真嗣当时并不愿深思这些。眼下，他满脑子都是明日香。她那丰满的胸部温柔地贴着他的手臂。她那如血般鲜红的秀发在光线下熠熠生辉。她的美，超乎真嗣所能描述。但他让她失望了，伤害了她，这份愧疚他将背负一生。真嗣的手因前夜的冲动而疼痛，那晚他为了保护她而与挚友反目。这难道是善良之举吗？他那被赞誉的荣誉又何在？

He was a weak kid. A kid who didn't have the maturity to handle the situations he was finding himself in. He had always heard how making decisions never became easier to make, but he sure wished they would. That there would be a pattern, or equation, that once one knew it all of life's tough choices became simple arithmetic. But that was nothing but make believe. Fairies probably don't have to make decisions like these, they know all the answers, because if something fake were real, wouldn't it have the resources of all fiction?  
他是个脆弱的孩子，尚未成熟到能应对自己所处的困境。他常听说做决定从未变得容易，但他真心希望如此。他渴望有一种模式或公式，一旦掌握，生活中所有艰难抉择都能像简单算术一样迎刃而解。但这不过是幻想。或许仙女们无需面对这样的抉择，她们知晓所有答案，因为如果虚构之物成真，难道不会拥有所有虚构作品的资源吗？

Shinji's arm was getting numb, he was going to have to move Asuka off of it. He gently whispered Asuka's name into her ear. She didn't respond. He started to tell her to wake up in his normal voice. Again she didn't respond. Shinji took a couple of seconds to collect his thoughts. He didn't want to yell in case his parents heard. There didn't appear to be any options other than moving her himself. He grabbed her and gently tried to turn her over. This didn't work particularly well. Asuka may not have been skinny, but that did not mean she was light. Shinji swore under his breath. His hands brushed against her shoulders, he was going to have to grip them and forcefully mover her. He prayed she wouldn't wake up then. His hands clasped, he took a deep breath and turned Asuka over.  
真嗣的手臂开始麻木，他意识到必须把明日香从上面挪开。他轻声在她耳畔呼唤她的名字，她毫无反应。他提高声音再次尝试唤醒她，依旧没有回应。真嗣稍作停顿，整理思绪，担心大声呼喊会惊动父母。看来只能自己动手移动她了。他小心翼翼地尝试将她翻转，但进展不顺。明日香虽不瘦削，体重却不轻。真嗣不禁低声咒骂。他的手触到她的肩膀，明白只能用力将她翻动。他心中祈祷她不要因此醒来。他紧握双手，深吸一口气，终于将明日香翻了过来。

She laid on top of him now completely. Her back laying right over his chest. This had not been a good idea. Shinji's breathing started to become harder, but this was not only because of the increased weight on his chest. Asuka's breasts were now within perfect view of Shinji's eyes. He couldn't look away if he had wished. Her nipples were lightly visible underneath her tight shirt. His mind went quickly back to the night before when he had felt up Rei. In only one second Shinji couldn't get his mind off of them.  
她此刻完全趴在他身上，背部紧贴着他的胸膛。这个举动显然不明智。真嗣感到呼吸越发困难，这不仅是因为胸口的压力增大。明日香的胸部正清晰地映入他的眼帘，让他无法移开视线。她的乳头在紧身衣下隐约可见。真嗣的思绪立刻飘回了前一晚，那时他曾触摸过绫波。仅一瞬间，他的心思就完全被她们占据。

Sweat started to pour down his face as he tried to think of something else. All that kept coming back into his mind was the need to touch it, feel it, experience what he had always been missing from Asuka. He moved his now no longer numb, and only mobile, arm, and slowly crept it towards the seductive lumps. His hand was only a couple of inches away when common sense returned to him. This was a terrible idea beyond terrible ideas. He needed to get out of there, needed an escape, but the only one who could do that was himself.  
汗水顺着他的脸颊流淌，他努力想转移思绪。然而，心中不断涌现的，是对触摸、感受那一直从明日香身上缺失之物的渴望。他挪动着唯一能动的胳膊，缓缓伸向那诱人的凸起。就在手即将触及时，理智突然回归。这简直是糟糕至极的想法。他迫切需要逃离，需要一个出口，而能实现这一点的只有他自己。

Without a better idea he put his arm around her stomach and tried to squeeze out from under her. It took a minute but he was able to nudge himself free. He stood up in a fit of pain. He was still sore all over, he had forgotten about that for a second. Asuka lay on the bed, completely asleep, with a cute little smile across her face. Shinji grabbed a sheet off of the ground and put it on top of her, and then walked to the washroom.  
实在想不出更好的办法，他只得伸手环抱住她的腰腹，努力从她身下挣脱出来。尽管费了些时间，他总算成功地挪了出来。他痛苦地站起身，全身的酸痛感再次袭来，有那么一刻他几乎忘记了这份痛楚。明日香躺在床上，已经沉沉睡去，脸上还带着一抹可爱的微笑。真嗣从地上拾起一张床单，轻轻盖在她身上，随后走向了洗手间。

Once in the washroom Shinji quickly stripped off all of his clothes. He stood there for a couple of seconds, naked, bare feet on the tile floor. He stared at his erect penis, thinking about how much pain it had caused him, about what it had almost made him do. It sickened him, he wanted to think that it didn't have as much control over him as it did, but someone can only lie to himself for too long. He drank as much water as his stomach could hold, masturbated, and downed three ibuprofen. If that didn't make him feel better he didn't know what would.  
在洗手间，真嗣迅速脱光了衣服。他赤身裸体地站立着，脚底贴着冰冷的瓷砖，凝视着自己勃起的下体，回想起它带来的痛苦和差点驱使他做出的行为。这让他感到厌恶，他多么希望自己能相信它对自己的控制力并不那么强大，但自欺欺人终有极限。他灌下了大量水，自慰后又吞下了三片布洛芬。如果这样还不能缓解，他真不知道还有什么办法。

He moved towards the dining room to try to put some food inside of him. It wasn't something he particularly wished to do, but always heard how eating helps one's stomach settle. The hangover wasn't going to disappear, but if his stomach stopped aching he would feel considerably better.  
他走向餐厅，打算吃点东西。虽然这不是他特别想做的，但常听说吃东西能缓解胃部不适。尽管宿醉不会立刻消退，但只要胃痛缓解，他就会感觉好多了。

His mother, Yui, was sitting at the table reading the newspaper. She was wearing her apron and eating a piece of toast without anything on it. The table was covered with different sections of the paper. On the counter there were a couple of dirty dishes. His father, Gendo, had probably already eaten and left for work.  
他的母亲绫波坐在桌旁，正阅读着报纸。她身着围裙，手中拿着一片未加任何佐料的吐司。桌上散落着报纸的各个版块。厨房台面上，几个脏盘子随意摆放。他的父亲源堂，大概已经用过早饭，赶去工作了。

There were few days his father wasn't either at work or traveling somewhere exotic with or without Yui. Shinji had often asked him why he couldn't just sit down and relax. Why did he need to dedicate himself to his work as much as he did? Gendo would laugh and describe how important his work was. He was doing mankind a favor, while feeding his family, what more could he ask for. Shinji never believed this, he always believed he was jealous of Yui. She was Fuyutsuki's favourite, and Gendo could never accept that. He loved her to death, but Gendo needed to be number 1, there were no other options.  
他的父亲很少有哪天不是在工作就是在带着或不带 Yui 去某个异国他乡旅行。真嗣常问父亲为何不能坐下歇歇。为何要如此拼命地工作？源堂总是笑着说，他的工作对人类至关重要，既能贡献社会，又能养家糊口，还有什么可求的。真嗣对此并不买账，他总觉得是自己嫉妒 Yui。Yui 是冬月的心头好，源堂却难以接受这一点。他对她爱得深沉，但源堂必须成为第一，别无选择。

Yui never particularly liked working. She just wanted to eat and relax, Shinji was in many ways more a child of Yui than of Gendo. Shinji didn't mind thinking that.  
结城向来不热衷于工作，她只愿享受美食与悠闲时光。在很多方面，真嗣更像是结城的儿子，而非元渡的。真嗣对此并无反感。

Shinji walked towards his mother at the table. She shifted the paper down slightly to take a look at him. Shinji gave her a slight smile and she returned him a deep frown. She stood up, pushing the chair out from under her, and pushed the newspaper down onto the table. Shinji didn't like the look of this. She walked right up to him and poked him right below the eye. Shinji let out a yelp of pain, having forgotten his black eye from the night before.  
真嗣走向桌旁的母亲。她稍稍下移报纸，目光投向他。真嗣对她露出微笑，她却皱起眉头。她站起身，推开椅子，将报纸压在桌上。真嗣感到情况不妙。她直接走到他面前，用手指戳了戳他眼睛下方的位置。真嗣痛得叫出声，忘了自己昨晚留下的黑眼圈。

"Where did you get that?" Yui said walking to the refrigerator. She opened the freezer and took out a couple of pieces of ice. She put them into a small plastic bag that was lying on top of the counter.  
"你从哪儿弄来的？" 结城说着走向冰箱，打开冷冻室，拿出几块冰块，放进台面上放着的一个小塑料袋里。

Shinji gulped and tried to think of an excuse. He couldn't outwardly lie, he wasn't a good enough of a lier to pull that off, it had to be believable too. "Well, I went to a party last night, and it got kind of rowdy. I was there with Touji and Kensuke, we had been invited by, well I don't really know who invited us, Touji just knew about it."  
真嗣咽了咽口水，努力想找个借口。他并不擅长撒谎，所以这借口必须得让人信以为真。“其实，我昨晚参加了一个派对，场面挺热闹的。我和东治、健介一起去的，我们是被邀请的，但具体是谁邀请的，我也不太清楚，东治只是偶然得知的。”

"Uh huh," Yui added, seemingly unconvinced by Shinji's story up to this point. Before Shinji could continue his story Yui gently placed the bag of ice against Shinji's face. As soon as the cold touched his face Shinji quivered back. Yui put her hands on her hips and gave Shinji a disproving look. "Come on Shinji, you have some swelling,"  
嗯，" 结弦应声道，显然对真嗣迄今为止的故事持怀疑态度。真嗣还没来得及继续，结弦已轻柔地将冰袋贴在他的脸上。冰冷的触感让真嗣不由自主地往后一缩。结弦双手叉腰，投去一个不悦的眼神。"真嗣，你脸都肿了，

Shinji sighed and let his mother continue to place it on his face. "So Touji started to challenge people to wrestling matches, to prove his manliness. He acts like that when he's around too many people. At one point he challenged me and without realizing it he went a little too far and gave me this."  
真嗣叹了口气，任由母亲继续将创可贴贴在脸上。“东治为了证明自己的男子气概，开始向人发起摔跤挑战。人一多他就这副德行。有次他向我挑战，没控制好力度，结果就弄成了这样。”

Yui put the bag down for a second and started to examine Shinji's face in closer proximity. She frowned a little, in a way Shinji was sure to have seen. "By he went a little too far, you mean he socked you in the face," she said without a hint of sincerity in her voice. Shinji wasn't doing a particularly good job of selling his story.  
结城放下包，凑近了仔细观察真嗣的脸。她眉头微蹙，真嗣定然察觉到了。“你说的太过分，其实就是他揍了你的脸吧，”她的话里听不出半点真心。真嗣编的故事实在不怎么可信。

"Well, he didn't intend it to hit my face. I think it was supposed to have been a punch in the shoulder, but I tried to dodge it. Unfortunately my dodging skill appears to put a worse part of my body in the trajectory," Shinji said hoping to reinforce his story.  
"其实，他并非有意要打我的脸。我猜他原本是想打我的肩膀，但我试图闪避。不巧的是，我的闪避技巧反而让更脆弱的身体部位暴露在了攻击路线上。" 真嗣解释道，试图让他的叙述更加可信。

Yui looked at him for a second before handing him the bag of ice to apply himself. He hoped this was a signal she had believed his story. Without hesitation he put the bag against his face, which was something he promptly regretted as he wasn't paying attention to how sensitive that area was. Yui sat back down on at the table and picked the newspaper back up from the table.  
结城瞥了他一眼，随即递上一袋冰块，示意他自己敷用。他暗自希望这代表她相信了他的话。未加思索，他便将冰袋贴在脸上，随即感到后悔，因为他忽略了那片肌肤的敏感。结城重新坐回桌旁，从桌上拾起报纸继续翻阅。

"Well you wouldn't want to keep your guest waiting. Later you can tell me the story behind that as well, I can't wait to hear the part about her clothes. You did at least use protection right?" Yui muttered from behind her newspaper.  
"哎，总不能让客人干等着。等下你得跟我讲讲那背后的故事，特别是她衣服的事，我可好奇了。你总该采取了些保护措施吧？" 结衣从报纸后头小声说道。

Shinji was flabbergasted. She obviously didn't believe a single thing he had just said. He stood for a couple of seconds trying to think of what to say. "It's not like that at all," was all he was able to think of. He bit his tongue soon after saying it, that was not going to help him at all.  
真嗣目瞪口呆。她显然对他刚才的话一个字都不信。他愣了几秒，试图找话说。"完全不是你想的那样，"他脱口而出。话音刚落，他就后悔了，这根本无济于事。

Yui lowered the paper from her face so that Shinji could see her face. "Don't worry honey, I would rather see you two together than whatever the hell was going on yesterday," she said with reassurance. Shinji breathed a sigh of relief, maybe he was making to much of all of this. "Just be smart about it!"  
结城把遮脸的纸放下，让真嗣能看见她的面容。“亲爱的，别担心，我更希望看到你们俩和睦相处，而不是昨天那堆破事，”她安慰道。真嗣这才松了口气，或许自己确实过于紧张了。“记得要理智行事哦！”

Shinji nodded his head with acknowledgement. And walked towards his room.  
真嗣点头表示同意，随即走向自己的房间。

He opened his door slowly and tiptoed his way into his room. His floor was covered with discarded clothes. Most surfaces such as his desk and bedside table were covered in different trinkets, papers and utterly useless devices he couldn't for the life of him figure out what they were for. It was kind of amazing the kind of mess he had been able to amass in such a small room. If any other person would have tried to describe it they would have used the word 'disgusting' and Shinji was slowly starting to see their point of view.  
他轻轻推开门，悄无声息地步入自己的房间。地上散落着一堆堆的衣物。书桌和床头柜等处，杂乱无章地堆满了各式小饰品、纸张和一些他绞尽脑汁也弄不明白用途的零碎物件。在如此狭小的空间里竟能制造出这般混乱，着实令人惊叹。若由他人来描述，恐怕会称之为“脏乱”，而真嗣也逐渐意识到这一点。

Asuka was lying on he bed without the cover Shinji had placed on top of her. Her eyes, wide open, pointed straight towards the ceiling, tears lightly rolling down her face. Shinji's good mood disappeared within the second. Things were about to get a lot worse, very quickly. He kneeled next to the bed and asked gently, "what's wrong?"  
明日香躺在床上，真嗣为她盖的被子已被掀开。她双眼圆睁，直勾勾地盯着天花板，泪水顺着脸颊缓缓流下。真嗣的好心情顿时烟消云散。情况即将急转直下。他跪在床边，轻声询问：“出什么事了？”

Without responding Asuka turned over onto her side facing the other way. She bundled herself into a ball and quietly let out a whimper. Shinji swallowed hard, trying to figure a way out of this. But doing things was never Shinji's strong point, and if the last two days had proven to him that he wasn't particularly good at it either. He put his hand on her shoulder and asked again "come on Asuka, please, what's wrong?"  
明日香没有回答，转过身去，背对着他，蜷缩成一团，轻声抽泣。真嗣感到喉咙发紧，努力寻找解决之道。然而，行动并非他的长项，过去两天的经历也证实了这一点。他轻触她的肩膀，再次询问：“明日香，求你了，到底怎么了？”

With a sniff Asuka replied this time, "I'm such an idiot." She rolled over once again back into the position she was in when Shinji had entered the room. "Why would I forgive like I did last night? Why do I still right now pretend the last two days didn't happen? I just want to roll into a ball and die! Fuck, fuck, fuck," she continued to repeat.  
阿苏卡这次吸了吸鼻子，自嘲道：“我真是蠢到家了。”她再次翻身，恢复到真嗣进屋时她的姿势。“为何我要像昨晚那样轻易原谅？为何此刻我还要假装过去两天的事从未发生？我只想蜷缩成一团，就此消失！该死，该死，该死，”她不断重复着。

"Come on Asuka, it's okay, it'll be okay," Shinji tried to reassure her.  
"明日香，别担心，会好起来的，" 碇真嗣尽力安慰道。

"Shut up you shit," she didn't appear to want any help. "It's not going to be okay, of course it isn't. Just look at us, we're a fucking dysfunctional couple like anything I know. I'm sixteen, I shouldn't have to deal with this crap." She grabbed a pillow and stuck her head into it.  
"闭嘴，你这混蛋，"她显然不希望得到任何帮助。"怎么可能好起来，当然不会。看看我们，我们就是我知道的最糟糕的混乱情侣。我才十六岁，本不该面对这些破事。"她抓起一个枕头，将头深深埋入其中。

Shinji put his arm on her back and started to rub it. "Please calm down, it'll be okay. I know I'm worthless as shit, and I don't deserve you, but I, I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than next to you." There was a silence between the two of them. "Look, I know I fucked up, with Rei, with you, I'm sorry. The only reason I think I even did that shit with Rei was because I thought she'd let me do it. It was dumb, meaningless. And, I don't know, you said last night you'd rather I lie to you about the whole thing, but I'm not lying right now, I promise."  
碇真嗣把手臂轻轻放在她的背上，开始抚摸。“请你冷静下来，一切都会好起来的。我明白自己一无是处，根本不配拥有你，但我真的，想不出还有哪里比在你身边更让我愿意停留。”两人之间陷入了短暂的沉默。“听我说，我知道我错了，无论是对绫波还是对你，真的很抱歉。我之所以和绫波发生那些事，是因为我以为她会接受。那真是愚蠢至极，毫无意义。而且，我不清楚，你昨晚说宁愿我对你隐瞒这一切，但我现在向你保证，我此刻说的都是真话。”

Asuka quickly turned around and grabbed the hand Shinji was rubbing her back with. "That's bullshit and you know it, but maybe I deserved some of this shit too. I'm sorry for being such a crappy friend." She pulled him in close by the hand and kissed him gently on the lips. Shinji tried to pull back, surprised by this greatly but Asuka kept him right in front of her even after the kiss. Starring him directly in the eyes she whispered "if I ever see you and her together again, ever, I am going to fucking cut off your penis." Shinji would have laughed at the comment had it not been for the extreme severity in her eyes.  
明日香迅速转身，一把抓住了真嗣正在揉她背的手。“你明明知道这是无稽之谈，但也可能我自找的。抱歉，我这个朋友做得太糟糕了。”她紧握他的手，轻轻吻上他的唇。真嗣惊愕地想要退开，但明日香紧紧抓住他，吻后依旧让他站在面前。她直视他的眼睛，低声威胁：“如果我再看到你和她在一起，我绝对会割掉你的命根子。”若非她眼中那不容置疑的严肃，真嗣或许会对此嗤之以鼻。

And Shinji gulped. 真嗣不由得咽了咽口水。

The two of them moved into the living room in which Shinji's mother was no where to be found. Asuka had put on the clothes she had worn the night before just in case Yui was still around. Shinji didn't really know where she might have scurried off to. There was little she did outside of work and watching television. It didn't matter at the moment anyway, they'd just act normal.  
两人步入客厅，却不见真嗣母亲的身影。明日香为了应对可能还在的绫波，特意穿上了昨晚的衣服。真嗣对母亲的行踪一无所知，她平日除了工作就是看电视，鲜少外出。眼下这并不打紧，他们决定表现得一如往常。

Shinji thought of what'd he make them to eat. He stood against the counters staring at the food but found himself suffering from vertigo. His knees became weak. He needed to find somewhere to sit down or else he was going to collapse. Asuka took notice to his legs shaking and got up from the seat she was sitting in. She gave him her hand for support. It was a firm grip, crushing Shinji's small hand, but it needed to be strong so that Shinji would not fall. She slowly lead him to a chair and sat him down. It appeared as if his hangover wasn't getting particularly better at the moment.  
真嗣思索着该准备什么食物给大家。他倚靠在柜台边，凝视着食材，却突然感到一阵眩晕袭来。膝盖无力，他急需找个地方坐下，否则就要支撑不住了。明日香察觉到他腿部的颤抖，立刻从座位上起身。她伸出手，紧紧握住他的手以提供支持。虽然握力有些过紧，几乎让真嗣感到疼痛，但这样的力度是必要的，以确保他不会跌倒。她缓缓地引导他走到一把椅子旁，让他坐下。显然，他的宿醉状况并未有所改善。

Shinji sat on that chair for around half and hour slipping in and out of consciousness. He had lost his grip on reality and often found himself surprised to find himself on a chair in his kitchen. Asuka made him some toast to give him some carbs. He tried to eat it, fighting the great urge in his stomach not to. There was no doubt food was what his body needed, but it seemed to be begging against him. The contradictions abounded in Shinji's torso as he wished he hadn't gone so far the night before.  
真嗣坐在那把椅子上，意识恍惚了大约半小时。他已无法掌控现实，时常惊讶地发现自己坐在厨房的椅子上。明日香为他准备了吐司，希望他能摄入一些碳水化合物。他努力尝试吃下，却要与胃中强烈的抗拒感作斗争。显然，食物是他身体所急需的，但身体似乎在抗拒。真嗣心中矛盾重重，后悔前一晚过于放纵。

After he was finished eating his bread the two of them moved to the couch. Shinji lied down across hoping to stretch himself out and help himself get comfortable. Asuka stared at him for a couple of seconds trying to decide what to do. Eventually she shrugged and climbed on top of him. The weight made Shinji lose his breath but he didn't mind. He could lie like this no matter how gone he was.  
吃完面包后，他们俩坐到了沙发上。真嗣躺下，想伸展一下身体，让自己舒服些。明日香盯着他看了片刻，犹豫着该怎么做。最后她耸耸肩，爬到他身上。这份重量让真嗣一时喘不过气，但他并不介意。无论自己多么疲惫，他都愿意这样躺着。

Without even realizing it Shinji slowly drifted into sleep. His whole body felt as if it were convulsing but there was no movement. He was in a stasis of experience, where each little touch was completely irrelevant but every feeling he could feel was essential. A friend of his would later tell him that this state is one of learning. In complete induced sickness one finds out how their body works, and in what manner their consciousness acts. Shinji liked this description, it was better than his previous one: feeling like crap even when sleeping.  
真嗣在不知不觉中沉入了梦乡。他的身体仿佛在抽搐，却不见任何动作。他处于一种体验的静止状态，细微的触感已无关紧要，但每一种感受都显得至关重要。后来，他的朋友告诉他，这种状态其实是一种学习过程。在完全诱发的病态中，人们能洞察自己身体的运作方式和意识的反应模式。真嗣觉得这个解释比他之前所说的“睡觉也感觉糟糕”要贴切得多。

Before he knew it Shinji opened his eyes. He looked over at the clock over top of his television and it showed the time to be around three o'clock. Asuka was lightly breathing against his chest far away in a dream somewhere fantastic. Asuka suffered from insomnia and nightmares, she had these dreams of great destruction. But that wasn't right then, at that moment she was smiling, probably dreaming of something beautiful. Shinji never remembered to ask later what exactly she was dreaming about. It was something he was meaning to do but never got around to. It wasn't all that important anyway.  
真嗣不知不觉睁开了眼。他望向电视机上方的时钟，时间显示大约是凌晨三点。明日香依偎在他胸前，轻柔地呼吸着，沉浸在某个奇幻的梦境中。她常受失眠和噩梦折磨，梦里尽是毁灭的景象。但那一刻，她面带微笑，想必梦见了美好的事物。真嗣总忘记事后询问她的梦境，虽一直想问，却总未付诸行动。其实，这也不算太重要。

Shinji lied like that for minutes, but they felt like hours to him. Hours he felt happy. This was different, new and exciting, maybe there was going to be some kind of light at the end of the tunnel. But then Shinji remember how fucked up everything was at the moment. Well hopefully it wasn't going to be as painful as he was expecting. Even when Shinji started to think that he knew deep down it wasn't true. He was going to have to live with it in some extent unfortunately.  
真嗣撒谎持续了几分钟，对他而言却仿佛度过了漫长的几个小时。那段时间里，他感受到了快乐。这种感觉不同以往，新鲜又刺激，或许隧道的尽头真有希望之光。然而，真嗣随即记起眼前的一切是多么混乱不堪。但愿痛苦不会如他所预料的那般深重。即便真嗣开始怀疑自己内心的认知，不幸的是，他仍需在某种程度上与之共存。

Out of nowhere determination sprouted out of Shinji's mostly inactive body and mind. They should do something, he needed to be distracted from all of these negative thoughts. He was happy in the moment, that was what was important. Maybe a walk outside, maybe a movie, something to escape this blissful silence of self doubt.  
真嗣的身体和心灵突然涌出了决心，这股力量似乎来自无垠。他们得找点事做，他必须从这些负面思绪中抽离。此刻的快乐至关重要。不妨去户外走走，或者看场电影，总之要打破这自我怀疑的宁静，寻求片刻的逃离。

Shinji lightly nudged Asuka trying to wake her up. She lightly batted away his hand and tried to come back to the dream she was having. Shinji tried again but this time Asuka grabbed his hand in the air before he touched her. Her grip was strong and slowly moved his hand a far enough distance so that he wouldn't poke her again if she let go of his finger. She looked up from his chest. Her eyes were slightly red. She was probably adjusting her vision to the brightness of the room.  
真嗣轻推明日香，试图唤醒她。她轻挥手挡开，欲重返梦境。再次尝试时，明日香在空中紧握住真嗣的手，力道坚定，缓缓将他的手移至安全距离，以防她松手后他再次触碰。她从他胸前抬头，眼眶微红，或许正适应着房间的光亮。

"Well that was pleasant, you weren't staring at my tits while I slept were you Shinji?" Asuka asked in a serious tone. Shinji gulped hard, knowing he had done just that earlier when he had woken up that morning. Inspecting Shinji's face a grin grew onto Asuka's face. "Don't worry about it, I think my tits are pretty amazing too," she teased.  
"哎呀，那真是惬意，我睡觉时你没偷看我的胸部吧，真嗣？" 明日香认真地问。真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水，心里清楚早上醒来时确实那么做了。看着真嗣的表情，明日香的嘴角勾起了一抹笑意。"没事儿，我也觉得我的胸部挺迷人的，" 她调侃道。

Shinji playfully pushed Asuka off from on top of him. She fell onto the ground and gave him the middle finger. They both chuckled a little at this. Shinji would later remember this moment with much importance. That was the first time they had ever even slightly playfully wrestled.  
真嗣顽皮地将压在身上的明日香推开，她跌坐在地，朝他竖起中指，两人对此相视而笑。真嗣日后将此情此景铭记于心，那是他们首次略带嬉戏的肢体接触。

Shinji sat up on the couch and asked "so what do you feel like doing today? We could go see a movie or something."  
真嗣从沙发上坐起身，问道：“今天想做点什么？要不我们去看场电影之类的？”

Asuka picked herself off of the ground. Her clothes were slightly scrunched against her skin and she took a second to fix it. The first thing Shinji thought she was going to do was to attack him but she did something he never expected. She sat across his lap so that she was staring right at him. Her breasts were mere centimeters from his face. In a seductive tone she asked "Well that depends Romeo, how much are you willing to spend on little old me? Especially considering all the shit you put me through the last two days. I want to feel like a motherfucking princess."  
明日香从地上起身，衣服贴着肌肤略显皱褶，她稍作整理。真嗣原以为她会发起攻击，然而她却做出了出乎意料的举动。她坐在他的腿上，直面着他。她的胸部近在咫尺。她以一种挑逗的口吻问道：“这得看你了，罗密欧，你愿意为小小的我付出多少？尤其是考虑到你这两天给我带来的种种不快。我想体验一把当个真正的公主是什么感觉。”

To say Shinji was taken aback from this would be an understatement. His mouth dropped and he started to sweat. In side of him somewhere he felt a flame spark. Asuka out of nowhere, was acting like she never had before, probably trying to make him uncomfortable. He would act like that as well. Fuck the problems. Fuck all the shit he's went through, he was going to have as good a time he could. And if he had to deal with the shit later, then he would deal with it later. He could live with that.  
说真嗣对此感到震惊，实在是太过轻描淡写了。他嘴巴张大，额头上渗出汗珠。内心深处，一股火焰悄然燃起。明日香突然间一反常态，可能是故意让他感到不安。他也会以同样的方式回应。管他什么问题。管他经历了多少糟心事，他决定要好好享受当下。至于那些麻烦事，以后再说吧。他觉得这样也行。

Shinji grabbed Asuka's waist and pulled her closer to his body. "Of course I'll give you anything you want. I live to obey." He kissed her neck and she squirmed and squeaked. Where this new found confidence was coming from he'd never know. But it felt good, he felt like a man, like a participant, like how real people live.  
真嗣紧握住明日香的腰肢，将她拉向自己。“我当然会满足你的任何愿望。我存在的意义就是服从。”他轻吻她的颈项，她扭动着，发出一声娇嗔。他无从知晓这股新生的自信源自何方。但这种感觉很棒，他觉得自己像个真正的男人，像个生活的参与者，体验着真实人生的滋味。

Asuka pushed Shinji's face away from her neck. She stared at him straight in the eyes. She had the most wonderful eyes, eyes you could get sucked into. They were wormholes that sucked every bit of colour into them. Instead of the colour disappearing into the eyes, they were exploding into a mosaic of the most wonderful shades. You could look into her eyes for hours and never loose interest for every second was a new experience.  
明日香推开真嗣紧贴自己脖子的脸，直勾勾地盯着他的眼睛。她的双眼美得令人沉醉，仿佛能将人的灵魂吸入其中。它们宛如虫洞，吸纳着周遭的色彩。这些色彩并未在她的眼中消逝，而是绽放成一幅幅绚烂的马赛克。凝视她的双眼，每分每秒都是全新的奇遇，让人百看不厌。

She ran one of her hands through his hair. He felt nice to feel her, feel her presence so near to him. She leaned in close to his ear and whispered "Your penis is digging into me."  
她的一只手轻柔地穿过他的发丝。他感受到她的抚摸，她的气息如此贴近。她贴近他的耳畔，低语道：“你顶到我了。”

Shinji's eyes opened wide and he pushed Asuka right off of his lap. For the second time she fell onto the ground in front of the couch. There was a silence between the two of them. Then Asuka started to laugh. Soon Shinji found himself joining in. It was a moment he couldn't possibly not enjoy. It was pleasant.  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛，猛地将明日香从自己腿上推开，她再次跌坐在沙发前的地上。两人间一阵沉默，接着明日香笑了起来，真嗣也跟着笑出声。这瞬间，他无法不感到愉悦，实在是令人舒心。

They sat like that for a couple of seconds. Shinji couldn't think of anything to add. Maybe it was better to just soak in the silence. If someone were to talk it would just ruin the experience. Eventually Asuka stood up and said "well all of this talk about doing stuff for me has been fun, but lets actually do something about it." She lifted her arm for Shinji to help her up. Shinji complied and pulled her up right. Asuka flashed Shinji a smile and added "well I should go home first. I never did tell mom that I was staying here for the night."  
他们静静地坐了几秒钟，真嗣无言以对。也许享受这片刻的宁静更为恰当。一旦有人打破沉默，这份宁静便荡然无存。不久，明日香站起身来，说道：“虽然讨论为我做事挺有意思，但我们还是行动起来吧。”她向真嗣伸出手，示意他拉她一把。真嗣立刻响应，将她扶起。明日香对真嗣展颜一笑，接着说：“我得先回去一趟。还没跟妈妈说我今晚不回家呢。”

"You want me to come with you?" Shinji asked.  
"你想让我跟你一起去吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Of course I want you to come with me. This is my special day isn't it? No running away for you!" Asuka scolded. What was up with Asuka acting like this? Shinji was starting to wonder if something was seriously wrong with her.  
"我当然希望你陪我一起。今天对我来说很特别，不是吗？你可别想临阵脱逃！" 明日香责备道。明日香这般表现，让真嗣不禁怀疑她是否真的有什么不对劲。

The two of them walked towards the stairs. Shinji had jokingly opened the door for Asuka when they left his apartment. He enjoyed it, and Asuka winked at him. They had to take the stairs down to Asuka's place seeing as the elevators were still broken. It really started to bug Shinji. Would it be too much to ask for something like that to be functional.  
两人一同走向楼梯。离开真嗣的公寓时，他幽默地为明日香开门，乐在其中，明日香也对他眨了眨眼。由于电梯还在维修，他们只能走楼梯下到明日香的住处。这让真嗣越来越心烦，难道要求这样的设施正常运作，真的过分吗？

As they descended Shinji started to worry. The last thing he wanted to do was talk with Asuka's mother. Hopefully that wasn't one of the 'things' Asuka wanted him to do for her. Her mother was paranoid of Asuka getting pregnant. For some reason she viewed this as Shinji's main goal in life. That was why the two of them kept trying to escape her nosiness. It wasn't so much about them wanting their privacy, rather they were trying to escape prosecution.  
随着下降，真嗣开始感到不安。他最不希望的就是与明日香的母亲交谈。希望这不是明日香要求他做的事情之一。明日香的母亲对女儿怀孕一事异常敏感，不知何故，她认定这是真嗣生活的主要目标。因此，两人总是设法避开她的过度干涉，与其说是为了隐私，不如说是为了避免被无端指责。

Luckily for Shinji once they got to her door Asuka slipped into it and closed the door behind her. She did so quickly that Shinji couldn't even say anything before she was gone. Which Shinji was thankful for of course.  
幸运的是，当他们走到明日香的门前，她迅速闪入并关上了门。她的动作太快，真嗣甚至来不及开口，她就已经不见了。真嗣自然对此感到庆幸。

He moved away for the doorway and sat down on some stairs. It was pleasantly silent. The stairs were catastrophically crammed into a small area. It was obvious they were not designed to be used other than in emergencies. The stairs themselves were concrete painted a red that had since faded into a brown. They were only a couple of feet wide, not enough for two people to walk up them comfortably. The hand rail was cold iron that had not been sanded. It had rough spikes popping out of it every couple of feet, maliciously waiting for someone to lose focus and feel their wrath.  
他离开门边，坐在一段楼梯上。周围一片宁静，令人感到舒适。楼梯狭窄得几乎令人窒息，显然不是为日常使用而设计，只在紧急情况下才会被启用。楼梯是混凝土制成，原本的红色油漆已褪成棕色。宽度仅几英尺，不足以让两人舒适地并肩行走。扶手是冰冷的铁质，未经打磨，每隔几英尺就冒出尖锐的突起，仿佛在恶意地等待着有人分心，感受其锋利。

The past couple of days since the elevators had broken down Shinji had become used to the stairs. At the very least he could claim they were healthier for him than the convenience of the elevators. He needed to exercise more, but so did the entire world. Plus, it wasn't as if he had a weight problem. With his metabolism who needs exercise?  
电梯故障后的这几天，Shinji 已经适应了爬楼梯。至少他觉得这比依赖电梯更有益健康。他确实需要增加运动量，其实全世界的人都一样。再说，他并没有体重困扰，以他那旺盛的新陈代谢，锻炼似乎也并非必需。

Loud noises started to erupt from Asuka's apartment. It sounded like voices but he could not make out any words. All that was sure was how the people talking sounded angry. Shinji wondered what he should do. He could waltz in there and back up Asuka, but then that would only do more harm than good. An idea would also be to descend a flight of stairs and hide until the whole thing was over but that didn't really seem to be much better.  
明日香的公寓突然传来喧闹声，似乎是人在争吵，但具体内容听不清楚。真嗣能感受到那股愤怒的氛围。他犹豫着，是否该直接进去支持明日香，但那样可能只会火上浇油。或者，他可以选择下楼躲藏，等风波平息，但这似乎也不是什么好办法。

The gray surrounded his eyes like a dim little blind dancing it stasis. There was a palpable loneliness he felt standing next to the stairs. It was as if had misstepped, or misplaced his goal. Wherever it was, it had kept going but left him there, marinating in his thoughts. An inch on his left leg erupted from the feelings, as if to manifest the discomfort that had been dancing, was now actually affecting his nerves. Or maybe he was finally starting to go crazy, and as paranoid as he had always thought. Neuroses of neurosis is still a neurosis of neuroses.  
灰色如一层朦胧的薄纱，环绕在他的眼周，宛如静止的舞步。站在楼梯旁，他深感一种切实的孤寂。仿佛是踏错了步伐，或是遗失了目标。无论那是什么，它已继续前行，却将他留在原地，任由思绪浸泡。左腿上的一寸肌肤因情绪而突起，似乎要显现出那一直舞动的不适，如今正实实在在地触动着他的神经。或许，他终于开始走向疯狂，正如他一直所担忧的那样，偏执中的偏执依旧是偏执。

Luckily it wasn't long before Asuka returned from her travels. She had different clothes on, a bright yellow shirt that had a little blue bird caressing her chest, and cute black skirt that hung at her knees. Her hair was rassled a little, and her face was red, as if it were trying to vainly to match the blood red of her hair.  
幸运的是，飞鸟不久便结束了旅行归来。她身着新装，一件亮黄色衬衫上，一只蓝色小鸟图案轻贴胸前，搭配一条俏皮的黑色短裙，裙摆及膝。她的发丝稍显散乱，脸庞泛红，仿佛在努力与她那火红的头发争艳。

"What the hell are you staring at?" Asuka asked in a stern tone. This was the Asuka Shinji knew, it was pleasant to see there was still a little bit of her still in there. "My mother wasn't too pleased with me leaving without saying a word, but it's cool." Shinji knew Asuka was lying, and she knew he knew, but that didn't matter. They wanted to pretend everything was okay, for if they accepted the madness and hate of Asuka's mother, then they would have to accept the madness and hate they felt for each other.  
"你到底在看什么？" 明日香厉声问道。这正是真嗣记忆中的明日香，看到她身上还保留着一丝本真，令人感到欣慰。"我妈妈对我悄无声息地离开很不满，不过无所谓了。" 真嗣心知肚明明日香在撒谎，明日香也清楚他心知肚明，但这已无关紧要。他们宁愿假装一切安好，因为一旦接受了明日香母亲的疯狂与怨恨，他们也将不得不面对彼此间的疯狂与怨恨。

Shinji walked up to her to try and caress her cheek, but she pulled away slightly as he approached. Deciding not to push it any further, Shinji started to descend down the stairs. Asuka quietly followed. "So where would you like to go first?" Shinji asked trying to realign their plans.  
真嗣走向她，本想轻抚她的脸颊，但她在他靠近时稍稍避开了。他决定不再勉强，便开始下楼。明日香默默地跟在后面。“你想先去哪儿？”真嗣问道，试图重新调整他们的计划。

Asuka smiled and came back to her earlier self ever so slight. A small smirk crept onto the top right side of her mouth. "Well Prince Charming, I was hoping we could get some food. Something warm," a tapping wrapped itself around her rhythm, and pleasant smells danced.  
明日香微微一笑，仿佛回到了之前的自己。嘴角右上方悄悄浮现出一抹狡黠的笑意。“那么，白马王子，我正想着我们能吃点热食呢，”她的节奏被轻敲声包裹，愉悦的香气随之飘荡。

Distracted by what was around the words, Shinji said nothing for a moment. Asuka noticed this and frowned, as if he was insulting her. Once he realized what he was doing, Shinji tried to think of something to say quickly. "There's a nice place down near the school, why don't we go there?" Shinji breathing started to speed up, his breathe started to become short, he couldn't understand why his body was acting so strongly to the situation.  
真嗣被周围的文字分了心，一时无言。明日香察觉到这一点，眉头紧锁，似乎觉得被冒犯了。意识到自己的失态，真嗣赶紧寻找话题：“学校附近有个挺好的地方，要不我们去那儿？”他的呼吸开始急促，气息变得短促，他不明白自己的身体为何对这种情况反应如此剧烈。

But soon his nerves were lot off the hook as Asuka nodded her head. "Lets race," she whispered under her breathe. Shinji heard her ever so slightly, but was going to ask her if that was what she had said. When he started to mouth the words, Asuka had already sped ahead of him. Trying to collect himself he found himself speeding forward as well.  
不久，他的紧张情绪便得以缓解，因为明日香点头示意。“来比赛吧，”她轻声细语。真嗣隐约听见，正欲确认，明日香却已抢先一步冲出。他赶紧调整状态，也紧随其后加速追赶。

His body, still sore from the night before, ached with every step he took. The headache he had woken up to started to return as he could feel his brain hurting whenever he made a sharp movement. He'd be damned if he let Asuka beat him though. Even with the knowledge he was going to lose, it was still probably smarter than just staying still. He would be blamed with letting her win if he gave up. Plus, somewhere in his head, he really wanted to be the victor.  
他的身体因前夜的疼痛而依旧酸痛，每迈出一步都感到痛苦。醒来时的头痛再次袭来，每当他做出剧烈动作，脑中的痛感便随之加剧。他绝不允许明日香击败自己。即便明知败局已定，继续努力仍比坐以待毙更为明智。若他放弃，定会被人指责故意放水。况且，在他心底，他确实渴望成为胜者。

Soon he caught up to an Asuka who was proclaiming her unmatched speed. The aroma of the restaurant danced outside of the door and tickled Shinji's stomach. He toes on his feet were trying to drag him in the store, but he needed to enter with Asuka. "Well then, that work up an appetite?" He innocently asked.  
不久，他追上了正自夸速度无双的明日香。餐厅的香味在门外飘扬，勾起了真嗣的食欲。他的脚尖几乎要自行将他拖入店内，但他得和明日香一同进入。“怎么样，这下饿了吧？”他纯真地问道。

"Say it." 说吧。

"Work up an appetite undefeated queen Asuka?" Shinji quietly said under his breath. Asuka nodded in appreciation to the forced complement and walked into the restaurant. Whenever they would race, Asuka would win, and would insist on being called a queen afterwards. Shinji always wondered why she would want this when she had already proven she was better; did she have such self-esteem issues that she couldn't trust an actual victory? If Shinji won the race, well they both pretended it didn't happen. Sometimes it was better to just ignore things that become troublesome later. Shinji accepted this, but secretly always felt great afterwards non the less.  
"激起食欲的不败女王明日香？" 真嗣低声自语。明日香对这勉强的恭维表示感谢，点头后走进餐厅。每次比赛，明日香总赢，之后坚持要被称为女王。真嗣不解，她已证明了自己的优越，为何还要这样；难道她的自尊心如此脆弱，以至于不相信真正的胜利？若真嗣赢了，他们俩都会假装没这回事。有时，忽略可能带来麻烦的事更好。真嗣虽接受，但内心深处，每次都感到无比畅快。

Over the meal little was said between the two of them. Off remarks about the food and little insults were all that left their mouths. Asuka had ordered a soup, while Shinji just ordered a small egg dish. It was nothing special. Shinji knew Asuka was being nice by not ordering something expensive, even if she was never going to admit it.  
用餐时，两人几乎无言。除了对食物的简单评价和些许讽刺，他们口中再无他话。明日香点了汤，真嗣则点了一份简单的鸡蛋料理。这并无特别之处。真嗣明白明日香未点昂贵菜品是出于好意，虽然她绝不会明说。

Afterwards Asuka dragged Shinji to a couple of shops. She would examine all kinds of different clothes, each one with a different opinion than the last. One would have made her breasts too large, another's ugly yellow would never go with her red hair. She never tried any of them on. Shinji was slightly annoyed by the banality of all of it. But he knew if Asuka actually wished to purchase any of this, that he would be the one to foot the bill, and maybe it was better to keep his mouth shut and let her explore.  
随后，明日香拽着真嗣逛了几家店铺。她对各式各样的衣服品头论足，每件都有不同的挑剔。一件显得胸部过大，另一件的土黄色与她的红发格格不入。她一件也没试。真嗣对这种琐碎感到有些不耐烦。但他清楚，若明日香真要买，掏钱的还是他，不如闭嘴，任她挑选。

It did not take long for Shinji to tire of the endless shopping. Asuka seemed to take notice to his dissatisfaction, and suggested they may want to take a break. Shinji was secretly overjoyed by the prospect, but insisted they continue. The day was for Asuka, not for himself. If he wanted that, then he shouldn't have done what he had.  
真嗣很快就对无休止的购物感到厌烦。明日香察觉到他的不悦，提议或许该休息一下。真嗣内心对这个建议感到高兴，却坚持要继续。毕竟，这一天是为了明日香，而非他自己。如果他想要的是另一种情况，那他就不该做出之前的选择。

But it started to tire his body out, as the different limbs around his body were jumping off of large buildings to avoid continuing to move. Despite the hours passed since waking, Shinji's stomach was still fragile. Every movement seemed to push it slowly closer to an edge of deep unsettledness. Each time the muscles would contract to counter it, but this was starting to drain him. When Touji had thrown him to the ground he had not expected such continued soreness.  
然而，他的身体逐渐感到疲惫，因为身体各部分为了逃避继续移动，纷纷从高楼跃下。尽管醒来已久，真嗣的胃依旧脆弱不堪。每一次动作都仿佛将他推向深渊般的动荡边缘。每当肌肉为了抵抗而收缩，他的体力便随之消耗。东治将他摔倒在地的那一刻，他未曾想到会持续感到如此酸痛。

To be honest, Shinji had never really been in a fight before. In the back of his head he felt proud of himself. He had fought back, and had not lost the fight too badly. There were many people from his class there, they had now seen Shinji was not only a weakling hiding behind Asuka. This was different than all of the times he had been bullied, and it was kind of nice.  
说实话，真嗣以前从未真正参与过打斗。在内心深处，他为自己感到自豪。他勇敢地反击了，而且并没有输得太难看。他的许多同班同学都在场，他们现在明白真嗣并非只是个躲在明日香背后的胆小鬼。这种经历与以往被欺负的时刻截然不同，让他感到一种莫名的舒畅。

Yet why he had been fighting was still present in his mind. Why could he had not been fighting to protect the honor of another person? Once more he had fucked up. At all times he tried to be the best possible person, yet at every turn he was always made the wrong decision. If he had it his way he would not hurt anyone, but somewhere in his mind he knew the truth.  
然而，他战斗的原因依旧挥之不去。为何他不能是为了保护他人荣誉而战呢？又一次，他搞砸了。他总是力求做到最好，但每次都做出错误的选择。若依他本意，他绝不愿伤害任何人，但在内心深处，他明白真相。

For his own betterment he had to sacrifice being a better person at times. The world was cruel for this. Had he not responded to Rei's message than he would still be in the same situation before. And had he completely ignored Asuka and tried to only be with Rei, he would hurt Asuka just as much as he was probably hurting Rei at this moment.  
为了个人的成长，他有时不得不牺牲成为更好的人的机会。这世界对此显得无情。若非他回应了绫波的消息，他或许仍陷于之前的困境。倘若他彻底忽略明日香，一心只与绫波相伴，那么他对明日香的伤痛，恐怕与此时他可能给绫波带来的伤害无异。

There was a little piece of Asuka's hair lying on her right arm. The thin ribbon was trapped by the tiny hairs dotting her limb. Red danced in her paleness and the blood shaped strip was a snake hiding in her own doubt. Shinji's eyes were drawn to it, and he slowly moved his hand close to it. He stuck out his finger towards it, and the static brought it to him. He gently felt the hair between his index and his thumb. The fascination with the strand continued for a couple a seconds until a small wind blew it out of his hand. It disappeared in the wind, and was gone.  
阿苏卡的一缕发丝落在她的右臂上，被细小的汗毛缠绕。红色在她苍白的肌肤上跳跃，血迹宛如一条蛇，潜伏在她内心的疑虑之中。真嗣的目光被这景象吸引，缓缓伸手靠近。他伸出手指，静电牵引着发丝靠近。他轻柔地用食指和拇指捏住这缕发丝，沉醉其中。然而，一阵微风拂过，发丝从他指间飘走，随风消逝无踪。

"I'm done," Asuka whispered, turning around to face Shinji.  
"我完成了," 明日香轻声说道, 转身面向真嗣。

It took a moment to bring himself back to reality, and to notice Asuka once more. Her face was subtle, and the little scowl was slowly creeping out of her lips. "You sure?" he asked.  
他稍作停顿，才从思绪中抽离，重新注意到明日香。她脸上的表情难以捉摸，嘴角渐渐显露出不悦。“你真的确定吗？”他追问道。

"Yes, lets do something else," the words barely escaped out of her mouth. Something was wrong, maybe she was realizing how wrong everything was.  
"是的，我们换点别的做吧，"她勉强说出这句话。显然有什么不对劲，或许她正开始意识到这一切的错误。

Shinji could have asked what was haunting her, but instead decided to try something differently. He knew it was a band-aid over the situation, but maybe they didn't need to fix everything right then. He arched his back straight up and took Asuka's hands. "Asuka, I would love it if you would accompany me to our little stairwell." Asuka stared directly into his eyes, trying to figure out what he was getting at.  
真嗣原本可以询问是什么让她心烦意乱，然而他选择了另一种方式。他明白这不过是权宜之计，或许他们无需立即解决所有问题。他挺直脊背，握住明日香的手，说道：“明日香，若你能陪我到我们的小楼梯间去，我会非常高兴。”明日香凝视着他的双眼，试图揣摩他的心思。

Without waiting to hear a response from her, Shinji started to lightly tug on her hands. Asuka shifted her gaze to the strange movements, and seemed as if she were about to ask what he was doing. But Shinji started to pull her in the direction of their home before she could get a word out. "Come on, I'm tired of this bullshit, I want what we had before, I want us," Shinji smiled, he was feeling strong, he wanted to come away from what the two of them weren't. If they were not themselves, then there was not a reason to continue what they were doing.  
不等明日香回应，真嗣便轻扯她的手。她疑惑地看着他的动作，正欲开口询问。然而，真嗣未等她出声，便拉着她向家的方向走去。“走吧，我厌倦了这些纷扰，我怀念我们曾经的模样，我渴望我们的重归于好。”真嗣带着微笑，内心坚定，他决心摆脱两人间的隔阂。若彼此不再真实，继续下去又有何意义？

Asuka wiggled her hands out of Shinji's, but continued to walk beside him. She lightly put her hand on his neck. "I'm always me, and you're always you," she said lightly. "But I will feel like a princess if you bring me back to my castle, and save me from the dragon."  
明日香从真嗣手中抽回双手，却依旧与他并肩前行。她轻抚他的脖颈，柔声道：“我始终是我，你也始终是你。但若你能护送我回城堡，从恶龙手中救我，我定会感觉自己如同公主一般。”

They walked in silence. 他们静静地走着。

Asuka put her head on his shoulder.  
明日香将头倚在他的肩上。

It was nice for a couple of moments, but such times never last. As if their luck had run out, Rei turned a corner and was walking towards them. Shinji could feel his stomach constrict. The first thing to come to mind was to say something, but his throat became parched, and the words escaped him. Each new step the two of them took, different nightmares flashed before his eyes. Different tones and different fatalities presented themselves without shame, each with new ways. His thoughts betrayed him in a sense, for he would have loved to have been able to think clearly.  
有那么片刻感觉挺好，但这样的时光总是短暂。Rei 转过拐角，正朝他们走来，仿佛好运已尽。Shinji 感到胃部一阵紧缩。他本想开口说些什么，喉咙却突然干涩，话语卡在了喉间。随着两人每迈出一步，不同的噩梦在他眼前闪过。不同的语气和悲剧毫不掩饰地展现，每一次都有新的花样。他的思绪背叛了他，因为他多么希望能清晰地思考。

Rei's face was a face of obvious disdain. She was probably not happy the guy she had made-out with the night before was walking around with a girl she would have probably described as 'a total bitch'. And was a certain amount of right she had to hold this position. Shinji had been dreading the next time he would face her, but he had hoped it wouldn't be until school started. Why did it have to happen when he and Asuka were having a nice moment?  
绫的表情明显流露出不屑。她可能对前一晚与她亲热的那个男生现在和一位她或许会称之为“彻头彻尾的贱人”的女孩在一起感到不满。她这么想也并非全无道理。真嗣一直害怕再次面对她，本希望至少能拖到开学。为何偏偏要在他和明日香共享美好时刻时发生呢？

Shinji did not look at Asuka, he could not bring himself to.  
真嗣没有勇气去看明日香。

When they became close to one another, the three of them stopped moving. Rei looked at both of the them, and with equal disdain in her voice greeted "Hey Asuka, hey Shinji." But as she finished saying Shinji's name, tears started to form in her eyes. The little diamonds reflected in the light, and her face constricted. Shinji felt terrible, worse than he had the entire morning. It was only then he realized the extent he had hurt her. He had been playing a game, and had been so focused on what he did to Asuka, Rei's feelings had been out of his mind most of the time.  
当他们彼此靠近时，三人都停下了动作。绫波看着他们俩，语气中带着同样的轻蔑，打招呼道：“嘿，明日香，嘿，真嗣。”但当她说完真嗣的名字时，泪水开始在她的眼中打转。这些泪珠在光线下闪烁，她的脸庞紧绷。真嗣感到非常难受，比整个早上都要糟糕。直到那时，他才意识到自己对她的伤害有多深。他一直在玩游戏，过于专注于自己对明日香所做的事情，以至于大部分时间都忽略了绫波的感受。

Rei turned around to run away. Shinji wanted to move and grab her, to tell her everything was going to be okay, but his body refused to move. He had done enough playing with both of them, he was done hurting people. If only he could go back the last two days and stop all of this from happening. It wasn't worth it, it wasn't worth it, it wasn't worth it.  
绫转身逃跑。真嗣本想追上去抓住她，告诉她一切都会好起来，但他的身体却动弹不得。他已经和两人纠缠够了，不愿再伤害任何人。要是能回到过去两天，阻止这一切发生该多好。这一切都不值得，真的不值得。

To Shinji's surprise, Asuka let go of his arm, and grabbed Rei's shoulder as she had started to walk away. "Hey, I'm sorry," Asuka said lightly, without the usually forcefulness found in her tone. "I'm sorry for this idiot, and for how I've been acting." Asuka did not apologize, this was something special.  
令真嗣意外的是，明日香松开了他的手臂，转而抓住了正要离去的绫波丽的肩膀。“喂，抱歉了，”明日香轻声说道，语气中少了往日的坚决。“我为这个傻瓜和我之前的态度道歉。”明日香很少道歉，这次显得尤为难得。

Rei slowly started to turn around. Asuka started to smile at her, with almost an innocence to it. Rei just starred at her as if she could not believe what she was witnessing. "You know, I think this whole thing is really my fault, I kind of lose myself sometimes," Asuka continued. "And, I don't actually want you to hate me. Everyone does, and I'm sick of it. I'm sorry."  
绫波缓缓转身，明日香对她展露微笑，那笑容中透着几分纯真。绫波凝视着她，仿佛难以置信眼前的一切。“你知道的，我觉得这都是我的错，我有时会迷失自我，”明日香接着说。“其实，我并不希望你讨厌我。每个人都这样，我受够了。真的很抱歉。”

There was a silence. Shinji had never heard Asuka talk as openly before. There was a tension between the three of them a person could have cut with a knife. "I don't think we've ever actually been introduced, my name is Asuka." Asuka lifted her hand towards Rei's. A smile laid softly between her cheeks. The small diamonds growing in her eyes were hard to see, and she was probably trying to hide them.  
四周一片寂静。真嗣从未听过明日香如此坦诚地表达。三人间的紧张感，简直可以用刀子切开。“我们好像还没正式介绍过呢，我叫明日香。”明日香向绫波伸出手，脸颊上浮现出柔和的微笑。她眼中闪烁的泪光不易察觉，或许她正努力掩饰。

It took a couple of seconds but Rei reached out, and the two girls shook hands. "Hi, my name is Rei," she lightly, obviously feeling discomfort from the whole situation. She quickly let go of Asuka's hand and pointed her finger at Shinji. "Don't think you're getting out of this shit, you fuck. I'm tired of this game you've made me play." Her voice was sharp with intension to burn and break.  
几秒钟后，Rei 伸出手，与两位女孩握了握手。“你好，我叫 Rei，”她轻声说，显然对这局面感到不自在。她很快松开 Asuka 的手，指向 Shinji。“别以为你能逃脱这一切，你这混蛋。我已经厌倦了你让我参与的游戏。”她的声音尖锐，充满了破坏的决心。

Shinji started to apologize to her, but before he could get the words out of his mouth Asuka stepped in front of him. She placed herself directly between Rei's pointing finger and Shinji's exposed ego. "Now, friend, I want to make one thing clear. Don't ever fucking threaten my idiot, that's my job. I'm sure if you asked anyone in the last couple of weeks they'd said the exact same thing." She leaned closer and grabbed Rei's pointed index. "See, you wouldn't like me if I get upset, and if someone over steps and gets too close to him: I get upset. Today Shinji's making me feel like a princess, but let me tell you, I'm one badass motherfucking warrior princess, and a hell of a lot more man than that boy's ever known." Her tone was harsh and exaggerated. Shinji actually sighed a little when he heard it. This was the Asuka he knew, the girl who'd been his only friend when they were longer. It was nice to see she had not changed.  
真嗣正要向她道歉，话还没出口，明日香就挡在了他面前。她直接站在了绫波的指尖和真嗣脆弱的自尊之间。“听着，朋友，我要明确告诉你。别威胁我的傻瓜，那是我该做的。我相信你过去几周问任何人，他们都会这么说。”她凑近了，抓住了绫波伸出的食指。“看，我生气的时候，你不会喜欢我的，如果有人越界，离他太近：我就会生气。今天真嗣让我感觉像个公主，但让我告诉你，我是个狠角色，比那小子见过的任何人都强悍。”她的语气严厉而夸张。 真嗣听到这话，不禁微微叹息。这正是他所熟知的明日香，那个在他们年少时唯一的朋友。看到她依旧如初，心中感到一丝欣慰。

At the same time, the new Asuka had been one hell of a lot less scary.  
同时，新飞鸟号远不如之前那么令人畏惧。

Rei off put Shinji by her next actions. She smirked as if her mouth was trying to find a way off of her face. She pushed her grasped index finger towards Asuka's chest until the finger was within an inch of Asuka's chest. "Despite how hard you're trying to scare me, know this. You are never going to scare me, and you are never going to beat me." Her voice was monotone, like that of a body without soul. Her eyes became distant, and almost cruel in their disinterest. "But there is one thing I've learned in the last couple of days, that boy ain't worth it.  
绫波用接下来的行动让真嗣退缩。她嘴角勾起一抹冷笑，仿佛嘴巴正试图逃离她的脸庞。她伸出紧握的食指，直逼明日香的胸口，直到指尖离其仅一寸之遥。“尽管你竭力想吓唬我，但记住，你永远无法吓倒我，也永远无法战胜我。”她的声音单调得如同没有灵魂的躯壳。眼神变得疏离，甚至带着几分残忍的漠然。“但最近几天我领悟到，那个男孩不值得。”

"He just attaches himself to the closest person who is willing to let him. He's a leech without an inch of a vertebrae. The next time a girl comes by and is in an way interested in him, he's going to follow her skirt, just like he did mine. You won't be able to hold on to him like you want, no matter how serious your relationship gets. Enjoy your worm!" And with that Rei walked away, half laughing and half crying.  
"他不过是个依附于身边愿意接纳他的人的寄生虫，毫无骨气可言。一旦有女孩对他稍显兴趣，他便会像当初对我那样，紧随其后。无论你们的关系变得多么严肃，你都无法如愿留住他。好好享受你的寄生虫吧！" 话音刚落，Rei 带着半是嘲笑半是泪水的表情离开了。

Shinji and Asuka stood on the sidewalk as they watched her go. Neither said anything, nor did they look at each other. Once Rei had turned a corner out of their site, Asuka turned to Shinji and said "well that was fucking weird."  
真嗣和明日香站在人行道上，默默地看着她离去。两人既未交谈，也未互望。待绫波拐过街角不见踪影后，明日香转向真嗣，开口道：“这事儿真够怪的。”

In acknowledgement Shinji nodded. It took a couple more seconds before they both stopped thinking about what had just happened. Shinji tried to focus his thoughts, and bring them back to where they were before running into Rei. His legs ached and his feet were tired of holding up his heavy body. Reaching his hand towards Asuka, he started to walk back towards their house.  
确认无误后，真嗣点头示意。两人又沉默了几秒，才不再去想刚才的事。真嗣努力整理思绪，试图回到遇见零之前的心境。双腿酸痛，双脚因支撑身体而感到疲倦。他向明日香伸出手，一同向家的方向走去。

They came to the front doors and walked up to the elevators. The sign describing them as out of order was gone, and they appeared to be functional. Shinji sighed in relief. He was about to push the button but Asuka grabbed his hand away from it. "Come on, I want to take the stairs!" she announced, walking briskly towards the doors to the stairwell. Shinji stood in front of the elevators for a moment wondering whether he should follow her. He knew he was going to have to, but he did really want to take the elevator instead.  
他们走到正门前，发现电梯前的“故障”标志已消失，电梯似乎恢复了正常。真嗣松了口气，正要伸手按电梯按钮，却被明日香一把拉住。“快点，我想走楼梯！”她边说边快步走向楼梯间的门。真嗣在电梯前犹豫了片刻，虽然知道得跟上她，但心里还是更想乘电梯。

It took them a couple of minutes to walk up to the stairwell at Asuka's floor. Shinji sat down on one of the stairs completely exhausted. Asuka soon joined him. "See, now this is a castle. It's claustrophobic and grey. It's a wonderful aesthetic to hold a person over until they die. It's all very Gothic." Shinji joked, as he remembered how he had felt about it earlier in the day.  
他们费了好一会儿才爬到飞鸟所在楼层的楼梯间。真嗣瘫坐在楼梯上，疲惫不堪。飞鸟不久也坐到了他旁边。“瞧，这才叫城堡。又闷又灰，这种氛围足以让人撑到生命终结，真是典型的哥特风格。”真嗣打趣道，脑海中浮现出当天早些时候对此地的印象。

He turned his head to look at Asuka, whose face was red. She quickly redirected her gaze from his eyes, something out of the ordinary for Asuka. This whole day was like something out of the twilight zone when it came to her. "What is it?" Shinji asked delicately.  
他转头望向明日香，只见她脸颊绯红。她急忙将视线从他的双眼移开，这对明日香而言实属罕见。这一天对她来说，仿佛置身于奇异的幻境之中。“怎么了？”真嗣轻声问道。

Asuka laughed nervously, "it's just that, I'm remembering what I did in here two days ago."  
明日香有些局促地笑道：“其实，我是在回想两天前在这儿干的事。”

Shinji smiled, and almost without realizing what he was doing he leaned towards Asuka's ear. Softly, he whispered "you know, we can try that again, this time I promise I'll kiss you." He put his arm around Asuka's shoulder. Her skin was soft and clear, her back was arched.  
碇真嗣微笑着，几乎是不自觉地向明日香的耳边倾身。他轻声细语：“你知道吗，我们可以再试一次，这次我保证会吻你。”他伸手揽住明日香的肩膀。她的肌肤柔软而光滑，背部微微弓起。

Asuka did not respond with words. Shinji's hand on her arm started to feel her, and they both became absorbed. She grabbed his hand gently and they intertwined their fingers. Her other hand started to reach down. Shinji's eyes watched it intently. She grabbed the bottom of her skirt at her knees and slowly started to bring it up.  
明日香并未言语回应。真嗣的手轻触她的手臂，两人渐渐沉醉其中。她温柔地握住他的手，手指交织。另一只手则缓缓下探。真嗣目不转睛地注视着。她轻捏裙摆膝部，徐徐向上提拉。

Shinji could feel his breathe become heavier the closer it came to her crotch. His eyes were fixated beyond anything he had experienced before. His right hand grasped her hand firmer. Soon when the skirt was at the top of her thighs, Shinji held his breathe. Slowly, slowly, Asuka's white panties came into view. This time was beyond different than the two days before. This was personal, and mutual, and something Shinji had never experienced before. His stomach was constricting, but he was far too distracted to notice.  
随着距离她的胯部越来越近，真嗣感到自己的呼吸愈发沉重。他的目光紧紧锁定，超出了以往任何体验。他的右手紧紧握住她的手。当裙子被撩至大腿顶端时，真嗣屏息凝神。缓缓地，明日香的白色内裤逐渐显露。这一次与前两日大相径庭，充满了私密与共鸣，是真嗣前所未有的体验。他的胃部紧缩，却因太过分心而未曾察觉。

When the panties were completely exposed, Asuka's face turned towards Shinji. She whispered lightly, in a coarse voice, "Now it's time for your end of the deal." Moving at the same snail like pace, Shinji moved his mouth towards Asuka's face.  
内裤完全暴露时，明日香转向真嗣，轻声细语，声音略带沙哑：“该你兑现承诺了。”真嗣缓缓地，如同蜗牛般，将脸凑近明日香。

The kiss was an explosion Shinji felt throughout his whole body.  
这个吻犹如一股强烈的冲击，让真嗣感到全身都被震撼了。

It was nice. 挺好的。

They continued to kiss, never letting go of each other's mouth for more than a few seconds. Their right hands had fused together, and felt more natural like that than the limb had ever felt before. Asuka started to explore Shinji's tongue with her own, and they began to battle to see who could make the other's feel better. Shinji started to feel self conscious of how bad a kisser he was, but this quickly left his mind.  
他们持续亲吻，嘴唇几乎未曾分开超过片刻。两人的右手紧握在一起，这种触感比以往任何时候都来得自然。明日香开始用舌头探索真嗣的舌头，两人展开了一场较量，试图让对方感受到更美妙的触感。真嗣一度担心自己的吻技，但这念头很快便烟消云散。

As if it had a mind of its own, Shinji started to move his left hand towards Asuka's lap. It laid on her bare leg for a couple of seconds, before moving towards the panties Asuka had let him see. She was soft, and slightly damp, and as he started to explore a little, Asuka began to moan.  
似乎不受控制，真嗣的左手缓缓移向明日香的膝部。在她的裸腿上停留片刻后，他的手又向她展示的内裤靠近。她肌肤柔软，略带湿润，随着他轻柔的触碰，明日香不禁发出低吟。

But after a couple of seconds Asuka wiggled out of Shinji's hand and pushed his other hand away from her crotch. Shinji was surprised by this, and was about to apologize but Asuka interrupted him. "Don't you fucking dare apologize, what's it going to take you to stop doing that." There was a silence. "Look, just not right now okay?" And with that Asuka smiled at him.  
几秒后，明日香挣脱了真嗣的手，并推开他探向自己胯部的另一只手。真嗣吃了一惊，正欲道歉，却被明日香打断。“你敢道歉试试，到底要怎样你才能不这么做。”沉默片刻后，她说：“现在不行，好吗？”随后，明日香对真嗣露出了微笑。

Shinji tried to search for something to say in his mind, but for once came up empty. "Okay," was all that escaped his mouth.  
真嗣努力在心中搜寻着要说的话，然而这次却什么也想不出来。"好吧，"他最终只吐出了这么一句。

Asuka rested her head on Shinji's shoulder, and grabbed his hand with the one she had just let go with. "I swear to god, if you put me through what you have in these past three days again, I'm going to castrate you," she said, without even the smallest amount of joking in her voice.  
明日香把头倚在真嗣肩上，用刚松开的那只手握住了他的手。“我发誓，要是你再让我遭受过去三天那样的折磨，我绝对会让你付出代价，”她语气严肃，毫无玩笑之意。

Shinji swallowed hard, but he was used to such threats now. She had been giving them since they were little. But he smiled, because she was still his friend from when they were little, but she something was different today, something he was liking. And if anything, these past couple of days, he had done things, and made decisions, he was pretty proud of himself, even if he had fucked everything up.  
真嗣艰难地咽了咽口水，对这种威胁已习以为常。从小到大，她总是这样。但他还是笑了，毕竟她仍是儿时挚友，只是今天有些异样，有种他喜欢的感觉。过去几天，他做了些事，下了些决心，即便搞砸了一切，他仍为自己感到骄傲。

Shinji shifted his head to the right.  
真嗣把头转向了右边。

Asuka squeezed back. 明日香回握了手。

Author's Notes: So thank you for reading my story! I hope you enjoyed. Please review, I love feedback. This story in its entirety is the most important fanfiction I have ever written. It means a lot to me, all three of the chapters were written in very different parts of my life. I hope you take something from it too.  
作者附言：感谢您阅读我的作品！希望您能喜欢。期待您的评论，我非常珍视读者的反馈。这部作品是我迄今为止最为重要的同人创作，每个章节都承载着我不同生活阶段的心路历程。愿您也能从中获得共鸣。

Here is some Story Notes if you're curious:  
若你感兴趣，以下是一些故事笔记：

This story is an interesting case. You will find all of the three chapters are pretty different from each other despite continuing the same story.  
这个故事颇具趣味，你会发现虽然各章节承接着同一故事线，但它们之间的差异相当明显。

There was one and a half years between the first and second chapter. The third chapter was completed around three years after the second. So there is an obvious change in writing style between that time.  
第一章与第二章相隔一年半，而第三章则在第二章完成约三年后才问世。这段时间里，写作风格明显有所转变。

I wrote the first chapter 4 years ago, 1 year before I published it on . Evangelion was my new favorite anime, and I wanted to write something for it. Only, I thought the original was so perfect and personal to the director, I did not want to touch it. Instead, there was the alternate universe in the 26th episode that is not very well developed or complete. I personally think the idea behind the clip was that there were alternative stories to be told, not only the one presented by the show. So I decided I would try to write about that story. I also was pretty devoted to the Asuka/Shinji pairing. I usually did not care much for pairings since I believe they often hurt a person's appreciation of a story. This can be seen in other stories I have done where I try to challenge the idea. But when it comes to Evangelion, I thought the opposite. The pairing of Asuka/Shinji greatly improved someone's experience of Evangelion. So I though I would focus on the pairing, and present how it could have happened differently in this alternative universe.  
四年前，我完成了第一章的创作，比它在网上公开早了一年。那时，《新世纪福音战士》成为我心中的最爱，我渴望为其添砖加瓦。然而，原作的完美与导演的情感深度让我不忍改动。取而代之，我关注到第 26 集中的平行宇宙，它尚未充分展开。我深信，这段剪辑暗示着，除了剧集主线外，还有更多故事等待发掘。于是，我决定投身于那个故事的创作。同时，我对明日香与真嗣的配对情有独钟。通常，我对配对持保留态度，担心它们会削弱对故事的纯粹欣赏。在我其他尝试挑战这一观念的作品中，这一立场亦有所体现。 然而，在讨论《新世纪福音战士》时，我的观点却截然不同。明日香与真嗣的搭档关系显著增强了观众对作品的感受。鉴于此，我打算深入探讨这对组合，并设想在另一个宇宙中，他们的故事线可能如何改写。

So I wrote the first chapter as a planned One-Shot. It was originally published on another fanfiction site and never got reviewed, so I decided to move it over to this site a year later. When I put it on I received more reviews than I have ever received for a story. It was only 2,650 words yet it got more reviews than some of my stories which had 20,000 words.  
因此，我按计划将第一章作为短篇故事创作并发布。最初它刊登在另一家粉丝小说网站，却未获任何反馈。一年后，我将其迁移至此网站。没想到，这篇仅 2650 字的作品竟收获了比某些 20000 字长篇还要多的评论，这让我颇感意外。

A lot of the reviews asked me to write a continuation, so that summer while I was bored I started to write a small second chapter. Originally I did not know where I wanted to go with it, until I went on a website. It was a pro Rei/Shinji pairing site, and they tried to defend the merits of their pairing. Most of it was kind of silly, but when discussing Shinji and Asuka, they had an interesting point. "If you put two people in a room alone long enough, they will get together" and the more I thought about that idea, the more I agreed with it. Though I will say, I believe they meant it literally, while I am taking it instead figuratively. They are both very lonely people in their minds, but they open up just enough for each other. Their loneliness leads to their relationship. The website was presenting this as a reason the Asuka/Shinji pairing didn't work, but I disagreed with this claim. So I decided I wanted to write a neutral chapter exploring this idea, and what it meant for both of them. The hope was that a person would be able to make their own decision to what it meant. Soon I ended up writing the longest chapter for a story I have ever done.  
许多评论都催促我写续集，于是那个夏天，闲来无事的我便着手创作了第二章的雏形。起初我并不清楚故事将走向何方，直到我偶然浏览了一个网站。那是一个支持绫波丽与真嗣配对的站点，他们竭力为这一配对正名。尽管大部分论点略显幼稚，但在探讨真嗣与明日香的关系时，他们提出了一个引人深思的观点：“若将两人长时间单独置于一室，他们终将走到一起。”我越是琢磨这个观点，越是觉得它颇有道理。不过，我猜他们是从字面意义出发，而我则更倾向于从比喻的角度来理解。他们两人内心都极度孤独，却恰到好处地向对方敞开了心扉。正是这份孤独，促成了他们的情感纽带。 网站将此视为明日香与真嗣配对失败的理由，对此我并不认同。于是，我决定创作一个中立章节，深入探讨这一观点及其对两人的意义，期望读者能自行领悟其内涵。最终，我完成了迄今为止最长的故事章节。

Later, thinking about the story, I was always proud how well received it was. I started to write a lot recently, and decided I wanted to write a third chapter. I just finished a 40,000 Avatar story, which is quite frankly depressing. Quickly I decided I did not wish to write a depressing story. Instead, I wanted to write something where my characters have fun, but also grow. That where the third one comes from.  
之后，每当回忆起这个故事，我都会为它受到的广泛好评而自豪。最近我写作颇多，并决心要创作第三章。我刚完成了一部四万字的阿凡达题材作品，说实话，颇为沉重。我随即决定，不想再写令人沮丧的故事。我更希望创作一个让角色们既享受快乐又能获得成长的故事。这便是第三章诞生的初衷。

Thanks for reading the story notes if you did, and thank you very much to all the people who have reviewed this story. None of my other stories ever got close to this one in reviews, and it meant a lot to me to finally have written something people liked. (Not to say my other stories are bad, hell arguably some are better than this, but I guess they just aren't what people are looking for on )  
感谢您阅读故事笔记，若您已阅，更感谢所有留下评论的朋友们。我的其他作品从未获得如此多的反馈，这次能创作出大家喜爱的故事，对我意义非凡。（并非其他作品不佳，实际上有些或许更胜一筹，只是可能不太符合大家的期待。）
