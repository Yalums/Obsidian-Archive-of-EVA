Hesitating for just one second can mean the difference between hurting someone, and comforting them. And sometimes, hesitation is the very cause for somebody being comforted in the end. [Minor Teenage Nudity]  
仅仅一秒钟的犹豫，可能就决定了是伤害一个人，还是安慰他们。而有时，正是这份犹豫最终导致了某人被安慰。[轻微青少年裸露]

I let a relieved sigh escape my lips as I reach the gangway where Asuka sits. She seems alright.  
当我走到阿斯娜坐着的舷梯时，我松了一口气。她看起来还好。

I open my mouth to say so when I hear her mumbling, and I snap it shut again.  
我正要开口说些什么，却听到她在喃喃自语，于是我又闭上了嘴。

"...won't help me..." "...对我没帮助..."

What is she mumbling about?  
她在嘀咕什么呢？

"He wouldn't hold me." "他不愿抱我。"

I-Is she? 她——她是吗？

"He wouldn't even kiss me back."  
"他甚至不愿回吻我。"

A-Asuka!? A-明日香！？

"Stupid Shinji." "笨蛋真嗣。"

She... wants me to hold her?  
她... 想让我抱她？

"...What a coward." “...真是个胆小鬼。”

My jaw clenches; I'm not stupid. How should _I_ know she wants me to hug her? And the hell can I kiss her back when I'm fighting to even breathe!?  
我的下颌紧绷；我并不愚蠢。我怎么知道她想要我拥抱她？而且在我连呼吸都困难的时候，我他妈怎么还能回吻她！？

I step forward until I'm directly behind the barrier tape, ready to say something.  
我向前一步，直接站在了警戒带后面，准备说些什么。

"Why won't he...?" I can't make out the rest as she sniffles.  
“为什么他不愿意...？”她抽泣着，我听不清她后面的话。

Is she crying? 她在哭吗？

I ball my right hand into a fist. Now's not the time to be laying into her!  
我右手握成拳头。现在不是责备她的时候！

I gulp. This is it; I mustn't run away.  
我咽了口唾沫。就是现在了，我绝不能逃避。

"A-Asuka," I begin tentatively. "Are you alright?"  
"A-明日香," 我试探性地开口。"你还好吗？"

She lifts her head from her knees and snorts derisively. "Do I look alright, genius?"  
她从膝盖上抬起头，轻蔑地哼了一声。"我看起来像没事吗，天才？"

"N-no, I-" "不-不，我-"

"Go away, Shinji." She drops her chin back onto her kneecaps. "Why are you even here?"  
“走开，真嗣。”她将下巴重新搁在膝盖上。“你来这里做什么？”

I swallow. Here goes: "I-I wanted to see you."  
我咽了咽口水。就这样吧：“我——我想见你。”

She... She laughs at me!? What is wro-  
她……她嘲笑我！？这是怎么回事——

...was that just a sob?  
...那只是一声啜泣吗？

She's standing up and turns around.  
她站起身来，转了过去。

No tear stains; that's odd.  
没有泪痕；这倒是奇怪了。

"To what?" she spits. "To look at the poor broken girl who's had her mind flayed?" She throws her arms out to the sides. "Come one, come all; free viewing today!"  
"为了什么？" 她愤愤地说。"为了看那个心灵被撕裂的可怜破碎女孩？" 她向两侧张开双臂。"来吧，都来看看；今天免费观赏！"

I'm sure my eyes are wide, but I stay my ground.  
我确信我的眼睛睁得大大的，但我稳住了自己。

I mustn't run away! 我绝不能逃跑！

Hardening my resolve, I step over the tape.  
我坚定了决心，跨过了胶带。

She snarls at me, but I stand there, resolute.  
她对我咆哮，但我站在那里，坚定不移。

"I wanted to help you."  
“我想帮你。”

Her eyes narrow. "Then do _nothing_. You're good at that, aren't you!?"  
她的眼神变得锐利。“那就什么也别做。你最擅长这个了，不是吗！？”

That... hurt, but I guess it's true. But not today. I am shaking in fright but I can't back down now. She needs me.  
那……很伤人，但我想这是真的。但不是今天。我害怕得发抖，但我现在不能退缩。她需要我。

"What are you still standing there for!?" she sneers. "Run away like you always do!" With that she shoves at me with her right hand.  
“你还在那儿站着干什么！？”她嘲讽道，“像你平时那样逃跑吧！”说完，她用右手推了我一把。

I catch it at the wrist.  
我抓住了她的手腕。

"What ar-" Her indignant question is cut short when I pull. She stumbles forward and I close my arms around her, embracing her.  
“什——” 她愤愤不平的问题还没问完，就被我一拉，踉跄着向前跌来。我双臂一合，将她拥入怀中。

Immediately she starts flailing and cursing at me. "What are you doing!?  
"她立刻开始挣扎并对我破口大骂。“你到底在干什么！？”

"Let me go, you asshole!" She kicks my shin and I wince, but I don't let go.  
"放开我，你这个混蛋！" 她踢了我的小腿，我疼得皱眉，但没放手。

"_Don't touch me!_" She starts beating her fists on my chest, but I don't let go.  
"别碰我！" 她开始用拳头捶打我的胸膛，但我没放手。

"Leave me! Do like you always do!" Her blows become weaker, I think she's running out of steam. I tighten my embrace.  
"让我走！像你平时那样做！" 她的击打变得无力，我想她快没力气了。我收紧了拥抱。

"Abandon me." Her voice cracks at the end and she thumps her fists onto my chest a last time but doesn't lift them, anymore.  
“抛弃我。”她的声音在句尾破裂，最后一次用拳头捶打我的胸膛，但再也没有抬起它们。

I can't really think of anything to say to her, so I try to keep it simple:  
我实在想不出该对她说些什么，所以我尽量保持简单：

"No." "不行。"

Asuka's angry expression suddenly shatters, she buries her face in my left shoulder and jerkingly, her arms lift until they lay around my neck; until she practically clings to me.  
明日香愤怒的表情突然破碎，她将脸埋进我的左肩，手臂颤抖着抬起，直到环绕在我的脖颈；直到她几乎紧紧依附于我。

What do you do in such a situation? I don't know, so I hold her and lay my head against hers.  
在这种情况下你会怎么做？我不知道，所以我抱着她，把头靠在她的头上。

She is completely silent, though I soon realize that my shoulder is getting wet.  
她完全沉默，尽管我很快意识到我的肩膀湿了。

I cannot imagine what kinds of things that Angel made her go through, but it doesn't matter. She needs me and I'll be there for her.  
我无法想象安吉尔让她经历了什么，但这并不重要。她需要我，我会陪在她身边。

As time goes on, her embrace slackens a little, but she never lets go, or lifts her face from my shoulder.  
随着时间的流逝，她的拥抱稍稍松懈了一些，但她从未放手，也未曾将脸从我的肩膀上抬起。

I don't know how long we are standing there, but some time later, Misato approaches us.  
我不知道我们站在那里多久了，但过了一段时间后，美里向我们走来。

"Hey," she says; she sounds exhausted. "I'll drive you guys home."  
“嘿，”她说；听起来疲惫不堪。“我开车送你们回家。”

I nod, and loosen my arms from around Asuka's waist. Immediately, her own arms around my neck tighten.  
我点点头，松开了环绕在明日香腰间的手臂。立刻，她环在我脖子上的手臂收紧了。

"Asuka?" I tilt my head a little, but all I catch is a tiny glimpse of one of her eyes. "Come on, let's go home." An almost imperceptible shake of the head is my only answer.  
“明日香？”我微微侧头，却只瞥见她的一只眼睛。“走吧，我们回家。”她几乎不可察觉地摇了摇头，这是我唯一的回应。

"Asuka, wha-" I don't know what to say or do, but luckily, Misato comes to my aid. She stoops down, hooks her forearm behind Asuka's knees and sweeps her legs up, then simply lays her across my arms that I didn't retract when she suddenly vanished from them.  
“明日香，怎——”我不知道该说什么或做什么，但幸运的是，美里来帮我解围了。她弯下腰，用前臂勾住明日香的膝盖，将她的双腿抬起，然后轻轻地将她放在我未曾收回的手臂上，她就这样突然从我怀中消失了。

For such a strong girl, Asuka is surprisingly light, and beyond the initial stumble, I have no problems getting her to the car park and into Misato's Alpine.  
对于一个如此坚强的女孩来说，明日香出奇地轻，除了最初的踉跄，我毫无困难地将她带到停车场并塞进美里的小鹿。

It is an odd feeling sitting with a girl in your lap, but it's not unpleasant. And even if it were, there are surprisingly few things I wouldn't do for Asuka.  
坐在你腿上的女孩，这种感觉很奇怪，但并不令人不快。即使如此，为了明日香，我愿意做的奇怪事情出乎意料地少。

Somehow, I can't remember how, I carry her up to our apartment, and Misato opens the door for me.  
不知怎么地，我记不清是如何做到的，我抱着她上了楼，美里为我开了门。

"Will you be alright?" she asks. "I have to go back. They barely allowed me to bring you home as it is."  
"你会没事的吗？"她问道。"我得回去了。他们几乎不允许我把你带回家。"

I smile what I hope is a reassuring smile. "We'll manage."  
我努力露出一个让人安心的微笑。"我们会应付过去的。"

"Asuka." Misato gives her auburn hair a soft stroke. "Take a long relaxing shower and get some rest, okay? You'll see, tomorrow it'll all seem like a bad dream."  
"明日香。"美里轻轻抚摸着她那深红色的头发。"去洗个长长的放松澡，然后好好休息，好吗？你会看到的，明天一切都会像是一场噩梦。"

"Misato!" I say sharply, and she flinches. "What do you thi-!" I stop short as I feel Asuka's arms around my neck give a short squeeze.  
"美里！" 我严厉地说道，她微微一颤。"你到底在想什么-！" 我话音未落，就感觉到明日香环在我脖子上的手臂轻轻一紧。

"I... I will," whispers Asuka from my arms. Gods, it's frightening how small she sounds!  
"我... 我会去的，" 明日香在我怀里低声说道。天啊，她的声音听起来多么微弱，令人心惊！

Misato gives a grim nod, steps outside and closes the door.  
美里沉重地点了点头，走出房间并关上了门。

I guess I should apologize to her later.  
我想我晚点得向她道歉。

"Don't you dare," come Asuka's barely audible words.  
"你敢," 传来明日香几乎听不见的话语。

Did I say that out loud?  
我刚才说出口了吗？

"Come on," I say, smiling down at her, "let's get that LCL off and then I'll cook you something."  
"来吧，" 我笑着对她说，"我们先把 LCL 弄干净，然后我给你做点吃的。"

I awkwardly slip out of my shoes and carry her into the washroom. There, I set her down on her feet.  
我笨拙地脱掉鞋子，抱着她走进洗手间。在那里，我让她双脚着地。

"Okay. I'll be in the kitchen. Just holler if you need someth-" Asuka's arms immediately tighten around my neck again.  
"好了。我去厨房。需要什么就喊一声——" 明日香的双臂立刻再次紧紧搂住我的脖子。

"Asuka...," I start, "You need to get cleaned up."  
"明日香...," 我开口道，"你需要洗个澡。"

"Don't go," she whispers.  
"别走," 她低声说。"

I sigh. "Alright. I'll start the heater." She lets go of me and I start for the bathroom door. I halt though when I hear rustling, and turn around. "Asuka, what...?"  
我叹了口气。"好吧。我去开热水器。" 她松开了我，我向浴室门走去。但听到窸窣声时，我停了下来，转过身。"明日香，怎么...？"

I barely manage to avert my gaze when her plugsuit falls from around her shoulders.  
当她的紧身衣从肩头滑落时，我勉强移开了视线。

"Am I that ugly?" “我那么丑吗？”

"What!? _No!_" I look back at her, careful to only be looking at her face and realize that her eyes are averted to the ground.  
“什么？！不！”我回头看她，小心翼翼只盯着她的脸，发现她的目光避开了地面。

"Then why won't you look at me?" She lifts her gaze to mine and I reel as if struck. Oh Gods, how can she look so hurt!?  
"那为什么你不愿意看我？" 她抬起目光与我相视，我如遭重击般后退。哦，天哪，她怎能看起来如此受伤！？

"I," I look her deeply in the eyes, "Asuka, I think you're beautiful, but despite what you always say, I am _not_ a pervert. I-It's not that I don't want to look, I do; but..." The words leave me. I don't know what to say or do.  
"我，" 我深深地凝视着她的眼睛，"明日香，我觉得你很美，但尽管你总是这么说，我并不是个变态。我——不是我不想看，我想看；但是……" 话到嘴边却说不出口。我不知道该说什么或做什么。

"Then please, Shinji," she pleads with me. "Please look at me."  
"那么，请，真嗣，" 她恳求我。"请看着我。"

"O-okay," I answer her. "好-好的，" 我回答她。

I dip my gaze down to Asuka's chin, her collarbone... I can't do it! She will hit me, and-  
我垂下视线，落在明日香的下巴，她的锁骨...我做不到！她会打我的，而且-

As I look up again in panic, my eyes again lock on hers and the fragility that in no way resembles her floods me.  
当我再次惊慌失措地抬头时，我的目光再次与她的相遇，那份脆弱感完全不像她，却涌入我心。

I clench my hands. Don't be an idiot; she's asking you to! I slowly drop my gaze again.  
我紧握双手。别犯傻了，她在邀请你呢！我缓缓地再次垂下目光。

Her collarbone. 她的锁骨。

Her shoulders. 她的肩膀。

Her-her breasts. I feel myself go red.  
她的...她的胸部。我感觉自己脸红了。

The creamy skin right below her chest.  
她胸口下方那片柔滑的肌肤。

Her bellybutton. 她的肚脐。

Her p-pubic hair. I go even redder.  
她的阴毛。我脸红得更厉害了。

He-her v-vu-vul-... private parts.  
她-她的私-私-私密...私密部位。

Uh-oh. 哎呀。

Oh no oh no oh no! Please no!  
哦不哦不哦不！请不要这样！

I shuffle shamefully as my trousers suddenly feel too tight in certain parts, and quickly continue down Asuka's legs.  
我羞愧地挪动着脚步，突然觉得裤子在某些部位变得过于紧绷，于是迅速继续沿着明日香的双腿往下看。

Wrong move. If anything, it makes my problem even more pronounced.  
这一招错了。反而让我的问题更加明显了。

"A-Asuka, I'm sorry! I didn't mean-" I snap my eyes upwards and trail off as I see her smiling faintly.  
"A-明日香，对不起！我不是故意的——" 我猛地抬头，话音未落，只见她微微一笑。

"You don't find me ugly," she whispers, to which I can only nod dumbly.  
"你没觉得我丑，" 她低声说道，我只能木讷地点头。

She shoves a fist into her side. "You got to see mine, now show me yours," she says, cracking a brittle grin that should probably look cocky.  
她将拳头抵在腰间。"你看到了我的，现在该让我看看你的了，" 她说着，勉强挤出一个本该显得自负的僵硬笑容。

I almost sigh in relief, there's the Asuka I know.  
我几乎松了一口气，这才是我认识的明日香。

Still blushing furiously, I nod. "F-fair's fair, I guess."  
我仍然满脸通红，点了点头。"F-公平起见，我想。"

Slowly and self-consciously, I remove first my shirt, then my trousers, and my socks.  
我慢慢地、有些不自在地，先是脱掉了衬衫，然后是裤子，还有袜子。

I'm a little apprehensive when it's only the boxers left - you see, he's still standing at attention - but after a quick look at her, I finally pull them down, too.  
当只剩下内裤时，我有些忐忑——你看，他依然挺立着——但在快速看了她一眼后，我最终还是把它们也脱了下来。

"A-Asuka, I..." I don't really know what to say to her, so I simply endure her lingering gaze.  
“A-明日香，我……”我不知道该对她说什么，所以我只是默默承受着她久久不散的目光。

"L-let's shower," she mumbles and gently turns me around and pushes me towards the tub.  
“我-我们去洗澡吧，”她喃喃道，轻轻地把我转过身，推向浴缸。

It's cold at first as I've just started the heater, but it's just what I needed to cool down.  
刚开始暖气刚开，感觉有点冷，但这正是我需要的降温方式。

As the water heats up, I quickly realize Asuka is at the edge of complete exhaustion when she drops her washcloth for the second time.  
随着水温升高，我很快意识到明日香已经筋疲力尽，她第二次掉落了毛巾。

"Asuka?" I lay my hands on her shoulders and try to make eye contact; which is rather difficult, as she's constantly blinking them, trying to stay awake.  
“明日香？”我把手放在她的肩膀上，试图与她对视；这相当困难，因为她不停地眨眼，努力保持清醒。

She's only halfway clean, LCL is still in her hair, and I'm sure I can smell her sweat.  
她才洗了一半，LCL 还粘在头发上，我肯定能闻到她的汗味。

Don't you judge me! 别评判我！

"A-Asuka," I repeat softly. "Is it okay if I wash you?"  
“A-明日香，”我轻声重复道，“我可以帮你洗吗？”

She only gives a faint nod, her eyes drooping all the heavier under the warm spray.  
她只是微微点头，在温暖的水流下，眼皮愈发沉重地垂下。

I cautiously, as gently as I can, soap her up and rinse her down, trying to ignore her small gasps as I wash her breasts and pubic area.  
我小心翼翼地，尽可能轻柔地给她涂抹肥皂，冲洗干净，努力忽视她在清洗胸部和私密部位时发出的轻微喘息。

The washing done, it takes only minimal prodding to get her to step out of the tub onto the towel in front of it.  
洗完后，只需轻轻催促，她便顺从地踏出浴缸，站在前面的毛巾上。

I take another towel and hold it open, wordlessly asking for permission, and again she only nods.  
我又拿起一条毛巾，展开它，无声地请求允许，她再次只是点头。

I wrap her hair into the towel and dry her down gently with another, then wrap it around her for warmth while I quickly dry myself.  
我把她的头发包进毛巾里，用另一条轻轻擦干，然后把它裹在她身上保暖，同时我迅速把自己擦干。

As I towel her hair off, I contemplate if she'll want it blow-dried, but decide against it. She'll need food and then a bed quickly; she's about ready to collapse.  
当我用毛巾帮她擦干头发时，我在想她是否想要吹干，但还是决定不这么做。她需要食物，然后尽快上床休息；她快要撑不住了。

I brush her hair gingerly and suddenly realize she has no change of clothes. As do I, for that matter.  
我小心翼翼地梳理着她的头发，突然意识到她没有换洗的衣服。我也一样。

"Asuka, why don't you go dress and I'll cook you something?"  
“明日香，你去换件衣服，我给你做点吃的吧？”

The reaction is immediate: Asuka whirls around, wraps her arms around my neck and buries her face in my shoulder again.  
她的反应立刻显现：明日香转过身来，双臂环住我的脖子，再次将脸埋进我的肩膀。

"Asuka, you need to eat something," I whisper to her, to which she only shakes her head. "Asuka, I still need clothes."  
"明日香，你得吃点东西，" 我轻声对她说，她只是摇了摇头。"明日香，我还需要衣服。"

"Don't leave me." "别离开我。"

"I won't leave," I say back to her. "I'll just be in the kitchen."  
"我不会离开，" 我回道，"我只会去厨房。"

"Don't leave me," she repeats a little more forcefully.  
"别离开我，"她再次说道，语气稍显坚定。

I sigh. "Alright, I'll stay."  
我叹了口气。"好吧，我会留下。"

Slowly, I disentangle her arms from around my neck - trying not to look down - and walk over to the hamper.  
我慢慢地从她环绕我脖子的手臂中挣脱出来——尽量不去看下面——然后走向洗衣篮。

I fish some tracksuit trousers from it - I've only worn them once yet, anyway - and don them.  
我从里面翻出一条运动裤——反正我只穿过一次——然后穿上。

"Come on, let's get you to bed," I say and lay a hand on her back, guiding her to her room.  
“来吧，我带你去睡觉，”我说着，把手放在她背上，引导她走向她的房间。

Once there, she simply lets the towel drop to the floor as she climbs into bed. I blush again.  
一到那儿，她就把毛巾直接扔到地板上，爬上了床。我又一次脸红了。

"G-good night, Asuka." I turn around to leave.  
"晚安，明日香。" 我转身准备离开。

"Stay..." "留下..."

I turn around. "Asuka?" I'm not sure I heard that right.  
我转过身。 "明日香？" 我不确定我听对了。

She looks up at me, her gaze openly pleading. "Stay... please?"  
她抬头望着我，目光中毫不掩饰地流露出恳求。“留下来...好吗？”

That's totally unfair! How can I say no to that?  
这太不公平了！我怎么能拒绝呢？

I turn back to her bedside and nod solemnly. "Alright, Asuka. Just let me get a blanke-" I trail off as she shakes her head.  
我转身回到她的床边，郑重地点了点头。“好吧，明日香。让我拿条毯子——”我话还没说完，她就摇了摇头。

"Hold me?" "抱紧我？"

Today is getting weirder still.  
今天真是越来越奇怪了。

"...Okay." I awkwardly crawl into the bed and close to her. She faces me and I swallow; she is still stark naked.  
"...好吧。" 我尴尬地爬上床，靠近她。她转向我，我咽了咽口水；她依然一丝不挂。

"Hold me," she repeats, almost in a normal volume this time.  
“抱紧我，”她再次说道，这次几乎是正常音量了。

I tentatively lay my arms around her, holding her awkwardly at arm's length.  
我试探性地伸出双臂环绕她，笨拙地保持着一臂的距离。

This doesn't seem to sit well with Asuka, as she shimmies closer until she's pressed into me.  
这似乎让明日香不太满意，她扭动着身体更靠近我，直到紧紧贴在我身上。

Gods, it's a wonder I'm still conscious!  
天哪，我还能保持清醒真是个奇迹！

I tighten my arms around her and ask, "Better?" to which she only nods.  
我紧紧抱住她，问道：“好些了吗？”她只是点了点头。

"Shinji, I..." Asuka trails off.  
“真嗣，我……”明日香话没说完。

I look down and catch her eye. "What is it?"  
我低头与她对视。“怎么了？”

"...Thank you." “……谢谢。”

"Anytime." I smile, and she answers it weakly.  
“随时乐意。”我微笑着，她则虚弱地回应。

On impulse - I don't know what possessed me - I dart forward and kiss her forehead. "Goodnight, Asuka."  
一时冲动——我不知道是什么驱使我这么做——我冲上前去，亲吻了她的额头。“晚安，明日香。”

Her smile grows and I feel as if the sun has risen.  
她的笑容绽放，我感觉仿佛太阳升起了一般。

"Goodnight, Shinji." “晚安，真嗣。”

**Author's Notes: 作者的话：**  
This is just a little idea that popped into my head when thinking about possible points of divergence. Alas, since I 1.) barely have time for my already running stories, and 2.) am not confident enough to write a Nailfic with the kind of darkness to it that this PoD requires, this will (probably) remain a oneshot.  
这只是在我思考可能的分歧点时突然冒出的一个小想法。唉，由于我 1.) 几乎没有时间来继续我已经在写的故事，以及 2.) 没有足够的信心去写一个带有这种黑暗元素的 Nailfic，这个故事（可能）将保持为一篇短篇。

### Comment
[AngelNo13Bardiel](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/564293/AngelNo13Bardiel): I don't know where this is headed...but by all means, please, continue on. These are the kind of stories that are *so* few and far between these days.
我不知道这将走向何方......但无论如何，请继续下去。这种故事如今已经少之又少了。

[Panther2G](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4474090/Panther2G): Only in the silence, while the rules are suspended, can she say the things without words that she's needed to.
只有在沉默中，当规则被中止时，她才能无言地说出她需要说的话。

[marduk-report](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1085273/marduk-report): puts it on alert just incase more is written.This is pretty decent; I'd definutely consider writing more, and writing something outside your comfort zone will help you improve as a writer in any case. :)
这很不错，我肯定会考虑写更多的东西，无论如何，写一些超出自己舒适范围的东西有助于提高你的写作水平。）

[jcmoorehead](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/957082/jcmoorehead): This was super sweet. I'm always a big fan of this sort of canon divergence, always a lot of fun to speculate what would happen at some key moments in the series. :)
这真是太温馨了。我一直都很喜欢这种与正典相左的情节，猜测在系列的某些关键时刻会发生什么总是很有趣。）
