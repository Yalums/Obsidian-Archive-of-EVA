---

Shinji stood in the living room confused. He was trying to process what had just happened. He kissed Asuka, or rather, she kissed him. His first kiss.  
真嗣站在客厅里，一脸困惑。他正试图理解刚刚发生的事情。他吻了明日香，或者更确切地说，是明日香吻了他。这是他的初吻。

"If you tell anyone about this I will kill you! Just forget about it!"  
"如果你把这事告诉任何人，我会杀了你！就当没发生过！"

After the kiss, Asuka ran off to the bathroom. Shinji didn't have time to react. He could hear the water and how Asuka brushed her teeth. She did that loudly, commenting on how stupid this idea was to kill time.  
亲吻之后，明日香跑进了浴室。真嗣来不及反应，只能听到水声和明日香刷牙的声音。她刷得很大声，嘴里还嘟囔着这个打发时间的点子有多蠢。

A distinctive sound spread through the apartment. The sound of the apartment door opening. Shinji took a few steps toward the hallway to get a view of the door. He expected to see Misato as she was the only one with a card to the apartment. He wasn't wrong. However, she wasn't alone.  
公寓里传来一个独特的声音，是公寓门打开的声音。真嗣朝走廊走了几步，想看看是谁。他猜是美里，因为只有她有公寓的门卡。他猜对了，但她并不是一个人。

"Help me please and open the bedroom door."  
“请帮帮我，打开卧室的门。”

It was Kaji. He was supporting a clearly drunk Misato. Shinji just nodded and immediately moved to help.  
是加持。他正扶着一个明显喝醉了的美里。真嗣只是点了点头，立刻上前帮忙。

Asuka came out of the bathroom and saw Kaji standing at Misato's bedroom door. She immediately ran up to the man.  
明日香从浴室出来，看到加持站在美里的卧室门口。她立刻跑向那个男人。

"Kaji!" "加持！"

The expression on the Asuka's face was now completely different. She was clearly happy to see Kaji. Just a moment ago, she was upset and complaining. This did not escape Shinji's attention. As far back as he could remember, she had always reacted this way at the sight of Kaji.  
明日香脸上的表情此刻完全不同了。她显然见到加持很高兴。就在刚才，她还闷闷不乐，抱怨连连。这一点没有逃过真嗣的眼睛。在他记忆中，明日香每次见到加持都是这样的反应。

"Hey kiddo." "嘿，小家伙。"

"Will you be staying the night?"  
"你今晚要留宿吗？"

Kaji laughed hearing the question. "I can't show up for work like this in the morning." He waved his hand goodbye and moved toward the exit of the apartment.  
听到这个问题，加持笑了。“我早上可不能这样去上班。”他挥手告别，朝公寓的出口走去。

"Don't worry about that. Stay here." Asuka grabbed Kaji arm. It was of no use, she let go of his arm and he left the apartment.  
"别担心那个。留在这儿吧。" 明日香抓住加持的手臂。但无济于事，她松开了他的手臂，他离开了公寓。

"Take care of Misato for me. Have a good night."  
"替我照顾好美里。晚安。"

"We will, thank you." Shinji closed the door and Kaji disappeared from view.  
"我们会的，谢谢。" 真嗣关上了门，加持的身影也随之消失。

Asuka's facial expression changed again. Before she let go of Kaji's arm, she smelled a scent. She knew it very well. It was Misato's lavender perfume. There was only one thought in her head.  
明日香的脸色再次变化。在她放开加持的手臂之前，她闻到了一种香味。她非常熟悉这种味道。那是美里的薰衣草香水。她的脑海中只有一个念头。

_'So they'__re_ _together again.'_  
'所以他们又在一起了。'

She thought for a moment, but noticed that Shinji was looking at her.  
她想了一会儿，但注意到真嗣正看着她。

"Are you all right?" "你还好吗？"

"Of course not!" She raised her voice. "I kissed an idiot like you!" She ran to her room.  
“当然不是！”她提高了声音。“我亲了一个像你这样的傻瓜！”她跑回了自己的房间。

Ceiling. A familiar ceiling. A view that Shinji once hated. Now it calms him down. He enjoys looking at the lights reflected on it.  
天花板。熟悉的天花板。曾经让真嗣厌恶的景象。如今却让他平静下来。他喜欢看着灯光在天花板上反射的样子。

_Good_ _work_ _Shinji_. 干得好，真嗣。

Words he heard from his father some time ago. Words that made him very happy. It was the first time his father had praised him. It gave some degree of meaning to his piloting. He even acknowledged it at dinner after the fight with the angel. But afterwards, his father didn't praise him. He wanted to change that.  
这是他不久前从父亲那里听到的话。这些话让他非常高兴。这是父亲第一次表扬他。这给他的驾驶赋予了一些意义。甚至在对抗使徒的战斗后，父亲在晚餐时也承认了这一点。但之后，父亲再也没有表扬过他。他想要改变这一点。

Asuka's reaction today to see Kaji gave some food for thought. In a way, Shinji envied these energetic reactions.  
今天看到加持时，明日香的反应让人深思。某种程度上，真嗣羡慕这些充满活力的反应。

His father praised him after successfully fighting the angel. Asuka said that Kaji's a man and he's just a boy. Is this a way to get attention? To show that one is a man? Is this what his father expects?  
在与使徒的战斗成功后，他的父亲表扬了他。明日香说加持是个男人，而他只是个男孩。这是吸引注意的方式吗？展示自己是个男人的方式吗？这是他父亲所期望的吗？

There remains the question of Asuka. He didn't understand her. Why did she kiss him?  
明日香的问题依然存在。他不理解她。她为什么要吻他？

Many people at school would envy him if they found out. Although, he knew that this fame wouldn't last long as she would kill him right after he revealed their secret.  
如果学校里的人知道这件事，很多人都会羡慕他。不过，他清楚这种名声不会长久，因为她会在他揭露秘密后立刻杀了他。

Shinji let out a light chuckle before turning to sleep.  
真嗣轻笑一声，然后转身入睡。

---

Asuka was lying on her stomach with her head in a pillow. Today was not a very good day for her.  
明日香趴着，头埋在枕头里。今天对她来说并不太好。

It started with a date with Kodoma's friend. Asuka didn't expect anything special from this date. She agreed only for Hikari's sake. Her expectations were low. She went mostly out of curiosity. Her low expectations turned out to be too high. She quickly returned to the apartment.  
一切始于与 Kodoma 的朋友的约会。明日香本没期待这次约会会有什么特别之处，她之所以同意，纯粹是为了光的原因。她的期望值很低，主要是出于好奇心。然而，她的低期望值还是过高了。她很快就回到了公寓。

She was met with a pleasant surprise at the apartment. Shinji's playing on the cello pleased her very much. When she applauded him, it was sincere. She didn't know that he had an instrument and that he could play it.  
在公寓里，她遇到了一个愉快的惊喜。真嗣在拉大提琴，这让她非常高兴。当她为他鼓掌时，那是发自内心的。她不知道他还会乐器，还能演奏。

Then came something she didn't understand herself. She was bored, but that was no reason to kiss Shinji. The kiss was weak, but there was something strange about it. She shook her head.  
接下来发生的事情连她自己也不明白。她感到无聊，但这并不是亲吻真嗣的理由。那个吻很轻，却有些奇怪。她摇了摇头。

'_It was the first time. That's probably why it was strange.'_  
'这是第一次。可能正因为如此，才显得奇怪。'

At the end of the day, she smelled lavender from Kaji. Asuka guessed that they still felt something for each other. She saw Kaji's efforts which made her nauseous. She tried to flirt with Kaji, but to no avail. He rejected her advances every single time. He always treated her as if he were her uncle.  
一天结束时，她从加持身上闻到了薰衣草的香味。明日香猜测他们之间仍有感情。她看到加持的努力，这让她感到恶心。她试图与加持调情，但毫无效果。他每次都拒绝她的示好。他总是像对待侄女一样对待她。

---

It was another training day at NERV. It proceeded normally. After the training, it was time for the sync test for the pilots.  
这是 NERV 的另一次训练日。一切按部就班地进行。训练结束后，轮到驾驶员们进行同步测试了。

Shinji tried to focus more than usual. Previous sync tests had taught him that it's best when he's not distracted by anything. Therefore, he tried not to think about anything and concentrate.  
真嗣比平时更加努力集中精神。之前的同步测试教会了他，当不被任何事物分散注意力时效果最佳。因此，他尽量不去想任何事情，专心致志。

The focus had a positive effect which didn't escape Maya attention.  
这种专注产生了积极的效果，这让摩耶注意到了。

"Major, please take a look."  
“少校，请看一下。”

Misato walked over to the monitor and looked at the data. It looked encouraging. Shinji got the highest score. It happened for the first time. Asuka's score dropped gently, but such fluctuation between tests was not unusual. The results fluctuated during the same test.  
美里走到监视器前，查看数据。看起来令人鼓舞。真嗣获得了最高分。这是第一次发生。明日香的分数略有下降，但这种测试间的波动并不罕见。同一测试中的结果也会波动。

"Good work Shinji, you're currently number one." Misato turned off the microphone. "Maybe this will boost his morale a little."  
“干得好，真嗣，你现在名列第一。”美里关掉了麦克风。“也许这会稍微提升他的士气。”

Through the monitor, they could see the satisfaction on Shinji's face. His focus worked. What he didn't know was that he was helped by Asuka's distraction.  
通过监视器，他们可以看到真嗣脸上的满意表情。他的专注起了作用。他不知道的是，这还得益于明日香的干扰。

"Thank you Misato!" "谢谢你，美里！"

"All it took was for the best pilot to arrive and you're already improving. A little more and you will be able to fight yourself."  
"只要最优秀的驾驶员一到，你就开始进步了。再努力一点，你就能自己战斗了。"

Asuka's mocking voice hid her true emotions. She was furious, but she didn't want to show it. After all, she was the best pilot, not him. Clenching the joystick with her hand, she wanted to continue mocking Shinji.  
明日香嘲讽的声音掩盖了她的真实情感。她很愤怒，但她不想表现出来。毕竟，她才是最优秀的驾驶员，不是他。她紧握操纵杆，想要继续嘲讽真嗣。

"Stop it and focus." Misato interrupted, cutting off the conversation. She didn't want another childish discussion.  
"别闹了，专心点。" 美里打断了对话，她不想再陷入一场幼稚的争论。

---

"My sister told me that the date went poorly. Sorry." Hikari felt bad for asking her friend for a favor. She did it because her sister Kodoma had been asking her for a long time.  
"我姐姐说约会进行得很糟糕。抱歉。" 光觉得请求朋友帮忙很过意不去。她这么做是因为姐姐小友已经缠了她很久。

"The guy was super boring. I left him while we waited in line. I was sick of his talking. Even Shinji is more interesting." Asuka looked at her friend. "No more blind dates."  
"那家伙超级无聊。排队时我就甩了他。听他讲话我都快吐了。连真嗣都比他有趣。" 明日香看着她的朋友，"再也不相亲了。"

"I promise." “我保证。”

They opened their lunch boxes and began to eat. Quite often they ate lunch together away from the other students. They liked to talk to each other on this occasion.  
他们打开午餐盒开始用餐。他们经常一起远离其他学生吃午饭。他们喜欢在这个时候互相交谈。

Asuka saw in the distance Shinji sitting and eating with his friends. She saw Toji glancing in their direction from time to time. He did that several times. A thought occurred to her. Not a very pleasant one. She got up from her seat.  
明日香远远地看到真嗣坐在那里和他的朋友们一起吃饭。她注意到有时候东治会不时朝他们的方向看去。他这样做了好几次。一个念头闪过她的脑海。不是一个很愉快的念头。她从座位上站了起来。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hold my lunch for a moment. I need to speak to the idiot."  
“帮我拿一下午饭，我得跟那个白痴谈谈。”

Asuka approached Shinji and grabbed his hand before he could speak. "We need to talk."  
明日香走向真嗣，在他开口前抓住了他的手。“我们需要谈谈。”

They moved away a piece, to a place where no one would hear them.  
他们移开了一段距离，到了一个没人能听到他们说话的地方。

"Did you tell anyone about our kiss?"  
"你告诉别人我们的吻了吗？"

"No, I didn't tell anyone."  
"没有，我没告诉任何人。"

Shinji didn't know why she was asking him. She had let him know beforehand what she would do to him when she told someone.  
真嗣不知道她为什么问他这个。她之前已经让他明白，如果她告诉了别人，她会对他做什么。

"Then why is your stupid friend Suzuhara looking in my direction every now and then as if he knows something?"  
"那为什么你那蠢朋友铃原时不时朝我看过来，好像他知道什么似的？"

The question puzzled Shinji, but also frightened him. He turned toward Toji and then looked at Asuka again.  
这个问题让真嗣困惑，也让他害怕。他转向了 Toji，然后又看向了明日香。

"I really didn't say anything to him. I swear. You can ask him."  
"我真的没跟他说什么。我发誓。你可以问他。"

"You really are an idiot. You want me to ask him if he knows that we kissed?"  
"你真是个白痴。你想让我问他知不知道我们接吻了？"

Shinji didn't think of that. She was right. He wondered how else he could convince Asuka that he had not revealed their secret.  
真嗣没想到这一点。她说得对。他不知道还有什么其他办法能说服明日香他没有泄露他们的秘密。

The expression on Shinji's face suggested that he wasn't lying. Asuka figured that if he said it now it was too late anyway. She came up with a quick idea of what she would do. When someone asks her, she'll simply deny everything and say that Shinji's a pervert and has sick fantasies.  
真嗣脸上的表情表明他并没有撒谎。明日香认为，如果他现在说出来，也已经太迟了。她迅速想出了一个对策：如果有人问起，她就直接否认一切，说真嗣是个变态，满脑子都是龌龊的幻想。

Asuka returned to her seat and spoke up before Hikari had the chance ask. "NERV stuff."  
明日香回到座位上，抢在光之前开口。“NERV 的事务。”

---

The door opened and Misato rushed into the room. The first thing she saw was a giant spherical creature with stripes displayed on the monitor.  
门开了，美里冲进房间。她首先看到的是监视器上显示的一个带有条纹的巨大球形生物。

"An angel?" “使徒？”

"Orange pattern, no A.T. field detected." Answered Hyuga.  
“橙色图案，未检测到 A.T.力场。” 回答的是日向。

"How is it possible that this thing appeared in the middle of the city unnoticed? Fuji station reported nothing?" Misato was concerned that something so large could slip under their noses unnoticed.  
“这东西怎么可能悄无声息地出现在市中心？富士站没有报告吗？” 美里担心如此庞大的物体竟能在他们眼皮底下悄然出现。

"There were no reports. This thing suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It moves very slowly, almost not at all." This time it was Aoba who answered.  
“没有任何报告。这东西突然就凭空出现了。它移动得非常缓慢，几乎不动。” 这次回答的是青叶。

Misato did not like what happened. She turned toward Ritsuko, who was analyzing the data from the computer together with Maya. Ritsuko just shook her head.  
美里不喜欢所发生的事情。她转向律子，律子正与真希波一起分析电脑上的数据。律子只是摇了摇头。

"The data is inconclusive. No conclusion from the MAGI."  
“数据不明确。MAGI 没有得出结论。”

"Where are the pilots?" “驾驶员在哪里？”

"Rei is waiting in her unit. Shinji and Asuka are leaving the locker room."  
丽正在她的单位里等待。真嗣和明日香正离开更衣室。

So far, the only good news. Another peek at the monitor. The angel is not moving. Not yet knowing what they were up against, Misato decided to take a defensive approach to the battle. She thought it best if they approached the angel from a distance.  
到目前为止，唯一的好消息。再次瞥了一眼监视器。使徒没有移动。还不清楚他们将面对什么，美里决定采取防御性的战斗策略。她认为最好从远处接近使徒。

"Redirect EVAs to elevator E-17. Have Shinji and Asuka approach the target slowly and have Rei support them from a distance with a sniper fire."  
将 EVA 转移到电梯 E-17。让真嗣和明日香缓慢接近目标，并让丽从远处用狙击火力支援他们。

"Yes ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

Misato needed more information on what they were up against. There was some time before the pilots reached the units. More scraps of information were coming from the team. Not enough to deduce anything. They sent the information to the pilots. Not much, but always something.  
美里需要更多关于他们所面对敌人的信息。在驾驶员们到达机体之前还有些时间。更多的零碎信息从团队传来。不足以推断出任何事情。他们将信息发送给了驾驶员。虽然不多，但总比没有好。

"A new type of angel?"  
“一种新型使徒？”

Ritsuko shrugged her shoulders. "We can't say much at this point."  
律子耸了耸肩。“目前我们无法确定太多。”

The pilots reached the surface. Rei took a sniper rifle, but she did not have a clear line of fire so she went to a more suitable position. There was not much choice of weapons in the place where they landed so they chose what was available. Shinji grabbed a pistol and Asuka grabbed an ax.  
飞行员们到达了地面。丽拿起了一把狙击步枪，但她没有清晰的射击线，于是她前往一个更合适的位置。他们降落的地方武器选择不多，所以他们选择了现有的装备。真嗣抓起一把手枪，而明日香则拿起了一把斧头。

"Shinji should take the lead." Asuka's voice sounded a bit mocking. "After all, he is number one."  
“真嗣应该带头。”明日香的声音带着一丝嘲讽。“毕竟，他是第一名。”

"Focus on the mission." “专注于任务。”

Misato did not like the kids' banter. Not at the moment. Right now they had a mission to carry out. Unfortunately, things were not going her way.  
美里不喜欢孩子们的斗嘴。至少现在不喜欢。眼下他们有任务要执行。不幸的是，事情并没有按照她的意愿发展。

"Asuka's right. You said it yourself that I am number one." Shinji's confidence took over.  
"明日香说得对。你自己也说过我是第一名。" 真嗣的自信占据了上风。

"That's not wha-" "那不是——"

It was too late. Shinji ignored what Misato was saying. He moved forward. Fast enough to cause a problem for Asuka. Her power cord snagged on the building and stopped her. She had to disconnect it and get a new one. It took long enough for Shinji to get away from her.  
已经太迟了。真嗣没理会美里的话，径直向前冲去。速度快到让明日香措手不及，她的电源线被建筑物勾住，不得不停下来解开并换上新的。这足够让真嗣摆脱她了。

'_Shit.'_ Asukacursed in her head when she looked at how far apart they were.  
'该死。'明日香在心里咒骂，看着两人之间的距离越来越远。

Shinji was close enough. He leaned out from behind the building and looked at the angel. A spherical body with no visible core. Just like in the data they gave him. Without thinking long, he pointed his gun.  
真嗣已经足够接近了。他从建筑物后探出身子，望向那只使徒。一个没有可见核心的球形躯体，正如资料中所描述的那样。他毫不犹豫地举起了枪。

"Attacking." "攻击中。"

Shinji fired two shots. Just as the first shot was about to reach the target the target disappeared. This caused great surprise among everyone. Both bullets missed.  
真嗣开了两枪。就在第一颗子弹即将击中目标时，目标突然消失了。这让所有人都大吃一惊。两颗子弹都落空了。

"It disappeared? How's that possible?"  
"消失了？这怎么可能？"

Almost at the same moment when Misato asked the question, an alarm sounded. An alarm that everyone knew well.  
几乎在美里提出问题的同一瞬间，警报声响起。那是每个人都熟悉的声音。

"A.T. Field detected right under EVA-01!"  
“检测到 EVA-01 正下方出现 A.T.力场！”

"Pattern blue, it's an angel!"  
“蓝色模式，是使徒！”

Shinji looked down and saw the ground getting darker and darker. After a while, everything above the dark surface began to sink. The lampposts, the buildings, and most of all, his EVA. Frightened, he began to shoot at the ground. Bullets fell into the ground and disappeared without effect.  
真嗣低头一看，发现地面变得越来越暗。过了一会儿，黑暗表面上的所有东西开始下沉。路灯、建筑物，尤其是他的 EVA。他害怕起来，开始向地面射击。子弹落入地面，消失无踪，毫无效果。

"Help! Misato!" “救命！美里！”

Shinji started screaming in terror. His unit was sinking to the ground. His feet were like glued on. It was dragging him like quicksand. He was unable to free himself.  
真嗣惊恐地尖叫起来。他的机体正在沉入地面。他的双脚仿佛被粘住了一样。地面像流沙一样拖拽着他，使他无法挣脱。

"Asuka. Rei. Help Shinji!"  
“明日香，绫波，救救真嗣！”

Asuka took off running towards Shinji.  
明日香立刻朝着真嗣的方向跑去。

Rei aimed her sniper rifle at the spherical body that appeared and disappeared from time to time. Her firing was ineffective. The target disappeared before the bullet could hit it.  
绫波瞄准了那不时出现又消失的球形躯体，她的狙击枪射击毫无效果。目标总是在子弹击中前消失。

"Help!" “救命！”

Another cry of despair. Shinji tried to block with his hand, but it didn't work. His unit was mostly absorbed.  
又一声绝望的呼喊。真嗣试图用手阻挡，但无济于事。他的机体大部分已被吞噬。

Asuka was almost there. In the distance, she could see a piece of head sticking up above the ground. She had very little time left. She looked around to see if she could see something with which she could try to free Shinji.  
明日香几乎到了。在远处，她能看到一块头部露出地面。她剩下的时间不多了。她环顾四周，看看是否有东西可以用来尝试救出真嗣。

At the command center, Misato looked on helplessly at what was happening. Seeing that Asuka was unable to do anything to help Shinji, she decided to announce a retreat. For now, there was nothing more they could do.  
在指挥中心，美里无助地看着眼前发生的一切。看到明日香无法帮助真嗣，她决定宣布撤退。眼下，他们已经无计可施。

"Retreat." “撤退。”

Retreat? Asuka was surprised. She was close. Close enough to help Shinji. She just didn't know how yet. She couldn't back out now and leave him.  
撤退？明日香感到惊讶。她已经很接近了，足以帮助真嗣。只是她还不知道该怎么做。她现在不能退出，不能就这样离开他。

"Wha-" Asuka was interrupted.  
"什-"" 明日香被打断了。

"Ikari is still trapped." Rei's voice was calm as usual, but Asuka could swear she sensed concern in that voice.  
"碇君还被困着。" 丽的声音一如既往地平静，但明日香发誓她能从那声音中感受到关切。

"Fall back now! That's an order!"  
"立即撤退！这是命令！"

Asuka did not immediately obey the order. She wanted to save Shinji. Unfortunately, all she could do at the moment was watch his unit disappear into the blackness. After a moment, she noticed the ground beneath her was becoming darker.  
明日香并没有立即服从命令。她想救真嗣。遗憾的是，她此刻唯一能做的就是眼睁睁看着他的机体消失在黑暗中。过了一会儿，她注意到脚下的地面正在变暗。

"A shadow?" “影子？”

She looked up, but saw nothing that could cast a shadow. She looked to the side and noticed how the ground where Shinji had disappeared had become brighter. She jumped up and climbed onto the building next to her. After a second, buildings began to sink in the blackness. Exactly as it had happened to Shinji.  
她抬头望去，却没看到任何能投下影子的东西。她转头一看，注意到真嗣消失的地方地面变得明亮了。她一跃而起，爬上了旁边的建筑物。片刻之后，建筑物开始在黑暗中下沉。正如真嗣所遭遇的那样。

She leaped further to the ground and began to run ahead.  
她跃向地面，开始向前奔跑。

"Is the angel chasing me?"  
“天使在追我吗？”

"No. Run to shaft E-13! Now!"  
“不。跑向 E-13 通道！快！”

---

Misato stood on the platform and stared ahead. Her gaze was not focused on anything. She was overwhelmed by recent events. A moment alone was supposed to help her concentrate.  
美里站在月台上，凝视前方。她的目光没有聚焦在任何事物上，被最近的事件压得喘不过气来。片刻的独处本应帮助她集中精神。

"What's the plan?" “计划是什么？”

Asuka's voice sounded behind her back. Misato didn't turn to face her. She continued to stand on the edge of the platform with her hands resting on the railing.  
明日香的声音从她背后传来。美里没有转身面对她，继续站在月台边缘，双手搭在栏杆上。

"For now, we are watching. The angel's not moving. It appears to be dormant. Ritsuko suggests that this may continue until Shinji runs out of life support."  
"目前，我们正在观察。天使没有动静。它似乎处于休眠状态。律子建议这种情况可能会持续到真嗣耗尽生命支持为止。"

"But you'll get him out right?"  
"但你一定会把他救出来的，对吧？"

Misato hesitated before answering. "That's the plan."  
美里犹豫了一下才回答。“这是计划。”

Misato didn't want to show that they had a problem. There was more they didn't know than they knew. They had time before the life support ran out, but was it enough?  
美里不想表现出他们遇到了问题。他们不知道的事情比知道的多得多。他们还有时间，生命维持系统还能撑一阵子，但时间够吗？

She turned around and saw that Asuka wasn't standing alone. Rei was standing next to her. Misato was slightly surprised because she didn't hear Rei's footsteps.  
她转过身，发现明日香并非独自一人。丽站在她旁边。美里有些惊讶，因为她没听到丽的脚步声。

Misato thought it was good that they were both here. They didn't know when the angel would wake up so pilots had to be nearby.  
美里觉得她们俩都在这里挺好的。他们不知道使徒何时会苏醒，所以驾驶员必须随时待命。

"You can't leave the base. There are rooms prepared for you next to the locker room. You're to be on alert."  
"你不能离开基地。更衣室旁边为你准备了房间。你必须随时待命。"

"But of course. Stupid Shinji messes up and I have to clean up after him."  
"但当然啦。愚蠢的 Shinji 搞砸了，我还得替他收拾烂摊子。"

Another spiteful comment from Asuka. Such comments didn't impress Misato. She was used to them. Misato wanted to let go and head for the bridge, but she heard a question that surprised her.  
Asuka 又发了一句怨言。这种话 Misato 已经习以为常，并不为所动。Misato 本想离开去舰桥，却听到了一个让她意外的问题。

"Why did you provoke him?"  
"你为什么要激怒他？"

Rei's question shocked Asuka. She stood still for a moment, but quickly recovered.  
丽的问题让明日香震惊了。她愣了一会儿，但很快恢复过来。

"Are you saying it's my fault that this idiot let himself be absorbed?"  
"你是说这白痴被吞噬是我的错吗？"

The question outraged Asuka. How dare this doll suggest such a thing? On top of that, she does it in front of Misato. Clearly irritated, she took a step forward.  
这个问题激怒了明日香。这个玩偶怎么敢提出这样的建议？更过分的是，她居然在美里面前这么做。明显被激怒的她向前迈了一步。

It looked like she wanted to hit Rei. That was something Misato could not allow.  
看起来她想打丽。这是美里不能允许的。

"No one is blaming anyone. The most important thing right now is to get Shinji out. I'll have a conversation with him later."  
没有人责怪任何人。现在最重要的是把真嗣救出来。我稍后会和他谈谈。

Without waiting, Asuka turned to leave. As she walked, she cursed something in German.  
阿斯克没有等待，转身离去。她一边走，一边用德语咒骂着什么。

---

'_I didn't know sleep could be so exhausting.'_  
'我没想到睡觉会这么累。'

Shinji looked once again at the displays. Nothing. The sensors detected absolutely nothing. His eyesight also saw only an empty abyss. He looked at the display on his wrist to see how much time he had left before the life support ran out.  
真嗣再次看向显示屏。什么都没有。传感器没有探测到任何东西。他的视力也只看到一片空洞的深渊。他看了一眼手腕上的显示屏，想知道在生命维持系统耗尽之前还剩下多少时间。

'_So this is how it ends?'_  
“所以这就是结局吗？”

Trapped, he waited. Waited to be rescued. But would that rescue come?  
被困住的他等待着，等待被救援。但那救援会来吗？

Sitting still, Shinji seemed to feel something. A familiar taste. Blood. He was frightened. He nervously grabbed the hatch lever. Tugging, he tried to turn it, but it didn't move.  
静静坐着，真嗣似乎感觉到了什么。一种熟悉的滋味。血。他害怕了。他紧张地抓住舱门把手，用力拉扯，试图转动，但它纹丝不动。

"Let me out! Help me!"  
“放我出去！救救我！”

His scream was not heard by anyone, he was completely alone. He curled up, shaking.  
他的尖叫无人听见，他完全孤身一人。他蜷缩起来，颤抖着。

Shinji looked around him. He found himself in a carriage, but how? The carriage was empty and orange light was coming through the windows. It looked like a sunset, but other than the light, he saw nothing. He must have been dreaming is the only explanation.  
真嗣环顾四周。他发现自己在一辆马车里，但这是怎么回事？马车空无一人，橙色的光线透过窗户照射进来。看起来像是日落时分，但除了光线，他什么也没看到。唯一的解释是，他一定是在做梦。

"Why are you here?" "你为什么在这里？"

He heard a familiar voice and turned around.  
他听到一个熟悉的声音，转过身来。

"Ayanami?" “绫波？”

Opposite him sat Rei. Or at least, a figure that looked like her. The question in his mind was where he was and what was going on.  
坐在他对面的正是绫波。或者至少，是一个看起来像她的人。他心中的疑问是，这是哪里，究竟发生了什么。

"Why are you here?" "你为什么在这里？"

"I fought an angel and lost."  
"我与天使一战，败了。"

"But why are you here?"  
"但你为何在此？"

What did she mean? He didn't understand the question. He repeated what he had said earlier. He fought and lost.  
她此言何意？他不解其问。他重述先前所言，战而败之。

"Why did you fight alone?"  
“你为什么独自战斗？”

Alone? What did she mean? Asuka and Rei were also there. He thought for a moment. He remembered the beginning of the battle. He wasn't alone then, but after that? Yes. He was actually alone later. But why?  
独自？她是什么意思？明日香和绫波也在那里。他思考了一会儿。他记得战斗开始时他并不孤单，但之后呢？是的，后来他实际上是独自一人。但为什么？

Then he remembered. He rushed forward first. They probably didn't manage to follow him.  
然后他想起来了。他率先冲了上去。他们可能没能跟上他。

"Why did you fight alone?"  
“你为什么要独自战斗？”

"I wanted to show my father that I was strong." Shinji replied without thinking. All he wanted that day was to impress his father.  
“我想向父亲证明我很坚强。”真嗣不假思索地回答。那天他只想给父亲留下深刻印象。

"Why?" "为什么？"

Anger was gathering within Shinji. After all, he said why he did it. What more does she want?  
真嗣心中怒火渐起。毕竟，他已经解释了原因。她到底还想知道什么？

"I want him to praise me! I want him to accept me!"  
"我想要他表扬我！我想要他接纳我！"

He shouted and then felt as if the carriage had stopped. A blurry platform appeared outside the window. The door opened and two figures entered. An older man holding a child by the hand.  
他大喊着，随后感觉马车似乎停了下来。窗外出现了一个模糊的站台。车门打开，两个人影走了进来。一位年长的男子牵着一个孩子的手。

'_Teacher?'_ '老师？'

Shinji recognized the older man. It was his teacher who had taken care of him for years. The little boy he was holding his hand also looked familiar. Was it him? Once again, he looked around the carriage. He knew this carriage.  
真嗣认出了那位年长的男子。那是多年来一直照顾他的老师。他牵着的小男孩看起来也很眼熟。是他吗？真嗣再次环顾车厢。他熟悉这个车厢。

He looked out the window. Shinji could see a man's back on the platform. He then felt a sting in his head. As if someone had stuck a needle in his head. He remembered.  
他望向窗外。真嗣能看到站台上一个男人的背影。随后，他感到头部一阵刺痛，仿佛有人将一根针扎进了他的头。他想起来了。

"Father!" "爸爸！"

Shinji moved from his seat toward the exit. In vain. The carriage door closed as soon as he approached it.  
真嗣从座位上起身走向出口。但无济于事。他刚靠近，车厢门就关闭了。

"Father! Don't leave me!"  
"父亲！别离开我！"

The figure did not turn around but continued walking. Shinji shouted again, but it did nothing. The carriage began to move. He moved to the door separating the carriages. Shinji jumped into the next carriage and called out again. Still nothing. He ran to the next door. When he opened it he saw a figure blocking his way.  
那身影没有回头，继续前行。真嗣再次呼喊，却毫无反应。车厢开始移动。他走向分隔车厢的门。真嗣跳进下一节车厢，再次呼唤。依旧没有回应。他跑到下一扇门前。当他打开门时，看到一个身影挡住了去路。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Over her shoulder, he saw his father disappear. He sat down on the seat next to the entrance and covered his face with his hands.  
透过她的肩膀，他看到父亲消失不见。他坐在入口旁的座位上，双手掩面。

"Pathetic. You're looking for acceptance, but can you accept yourself?"  
"可悲。你在寻求接纳，但你能否接纳自己？"

Shinji looked down through his fingers at the figure before him.  
真嗣透过指缝低头看着眼前的身影。

"Who are you? Leave me alone!"  
"你是谁？离我远点！"

"And who are you?" “你是谁？”

"Leave me alone!" Shinji shouted, shaking. "Just leave me alone."  
“别管我！”真嗣颤抖着喊道，“就让我一个人待着。”

---

A warm shower has always been pleasant for Asuka. Standing in the shower, she leaned her hand against the wall. Warm water ran down her body.  
泡个热水澡对明日香来说总是件惬意的事。她站在淋浴下，手扶着墙。温暖的水流顺着她的身体流淌。

'_It's not my fault that the idiot attacked alone.'_  
'这又不是我的错，那个白痴居然单独行动。'

Rei's earlier words upset her. Asuka only wanted to mock Shinji. How could she know what he would do? He always did what he's told and she didn't tell him to attack on his own.  
丽之前的话让她心烦意乱。明日香只是想嘲讽真嗣。她怎么可能知道他会怎么做？他总是听从命令，而她并没有让他单独攻击。

He never did anything on his own. Why did he do something this time? Why didn't he do something before like when they kissed?  
他从未自己做过任何事。为什么这次他这么做了？为什么之前不这样做，比如在他们接吻的时候？

'_That idiot didn't even move. He didn't touch me, nothing.'_  
'那个白痴甚至都没动。他没碰我，什么都没做。'

Frustration built up in her. Not sure why. She didn't know what she wanted. She didn't know if she expected anything from Shinji.  
她的挫败感越来越强烈。不知道为什么。她不清楚自己想要什么。她不知道自己是否对真嗣有所期待。

Then she remembered. She was wrong. After all, he had once done something of his own. He rescued her from the volcano. A slight smile appeared on her face when she remembered. At first she thought he was merely following an order, but later Misato told her he did it on his own.  
然后她想起来了。她错了。毕竟，他曾经主动做过一件事。他从火山中救了她。当她回忆起这件事时，她的脸上露出了淡淡的微笑。起初她以为他只是遵从命令，但后来美里告诉她，那是他自己的决定。

She hit the wall with her fist. She was angry that all she could do was wait.  
她用拳头猛击墙壁。她气愤自己只能等待，无能为力。

'_Come back. Don't leave me.'_  
'回来吧。别丢下我。'

---

Shinji opened his eyes and saw the familiar ceiling. Usually he wasn't happy to see a hospital ceiling, but now it was different.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，看到了熟悉的屋顶。通常他并不乐意见到医院的屋顶，但这次不同。

"You're finally awake." "你终于醒了。"

He turned in the direction of the voice and saw Asuka leaning against the wall. He was happy to see her even though he didn't remember what happened. The last thing he remembered was a dream he had.  
他顺着声音的方向转过头，看到明日香靠在墙上。尽管他不记得发生了什么，但见到她还是让他感到高兴。他最后记得的是一个梦。

"It's good to see you Asuka! How did I get here?"  
"见到你真好，明日香！我怎么会在这里？"

"I saved you. After all, I'm the best pilot."  
"我救了你。毕竟，我是最棒的飞行员。"

Typical Asuka boasting. He didn't even know how much he missed it.  
典型的明日香式自夸。他甚至没意识到自己有多怀念这种感觉。

"Why did you attack alone?"  
"你为什么要单独行动？"

"You won't understand it."  
"你不会明白的。"

Asuka walked over to his bed and sat on the edge.  
明日香走到他的床边，坐在了床沿上。

"That you would like to be a real man like Kaji?"  
"你想成为一个像加持那样的真正男人吗？"

Her words surprised him. How did she know? Were his intentions that obvious? Embarrassed, he scowled slightly.  
她的话让他吃了一惊。她怎么知道的？难道他的意图那么明显吗？他有些尴尬，微微皱起了眉头。

"Umm, you know I-" "嗯，你知道我——"

"You want to impress me?"  
"你想给我留下好印象？"

Now he was completely surprised. How did she know this and why was she acting so strangely?  
现在他完全惊讶了。她是怎么知道这些的，又为何表现得如此怪异？

Asuka leaned over him and then he smelled blood. He felt something like that trapped inside the entry plug. He pushed her away.  
明日香俯身靠近他，接着他闻到了血腥味。他感觉有什么东西像被困在插入栓里一样。他推开了她。

"You are you?" “你是你吗？”

"I can be whoever you want me to be."  
"我可以成为你想要的任何人。"

It's another dream, he was sure of it.  
这又是一场梦，他确信无疑。

"Release me! I don't want to be here!"  
"放开我！我不想待在这里！"

"Why? You can be happy here with us."  
"为什么？你可以在这里和我们一起快乐。"

Hearing a new voice, he raised his eyes. Rei appeared in the room. She looked so real. They both did. If it weren't for their strange behavior and questions, he wouldn't have been able to tell if it was a dream or reality.  
听到一个新的声音，他抬起眼睛。丽出现在房间里。她看起来如此真实。他们俩都是。如果不是因为他们奇怪的行为和问题，他无法分辨这是梦境还是现实。

"You're not real!" "你们不是真的！"

"You're not real either." A figure resembling Rei said.  
"你也不是真实的。"一个酷似丽的人影说道。

"How is this happiness more fake than the one you want to create?" Asuka's illusion added.  
"这种幸福又比你想要创造的假多少呢？"明日香的幻影补充道。

He covered his ears with his hands while shouting continuously. "Release me!"  
他双手捂住耳朵，不停地喊着："放开我！"

---

The corridor was empty. Apparently everyone was focused on finding a way to free Shinji. In a way, one could envy the attention he was receiving at the moment. And nothing more.  
走廊空无一人。显然，大家都在专注于寻找解救真嗣的方法。从某种程度上说，此刻他所受到的关注让人不禁有些羡慕。仅此而已。

After a short walk, Asuka found the food vending machine she was looking for. She walked over to the vending machine and selected a sandwich.  
走了一段路后，明日香找到了她要找的食品自动售货机。她走到售货机前，选择了一个三明治。

"Hi."

Asuka sharply turned around.  
明日香猛地转过身来。

"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."  
"对不起，我不是故意要吓你的。"

There was Maya sitting on a bench in the corner. She was drinking a can of coffee. Asuka immediately noticed the fatigue on Maya's face.  
角落的长椅上坐着真希，她正喝着一罐咖啡。明日香立刻注意到真希脸上的疲惫。

"I didn't expect to find anyone here. Everyone's busy trying to save Shinji."  
"没想到这里还有人。大家都在忙着救真嗣。"

"We hope so. Dr. Akagi says that the angel not moving is a sign that Shinji is still alive." Maya stood up and stretched her arms. "I have to go back."  
“我们希望如此。赤木博士说，使徒没有动静是真嗣还活着的迹象。” 真耶站起身来，伸了个懒腰。“我得回去了。”

Asuka nodded. When Maya moved away Asuka sat down on a bench. A cold shiver ran through Asuka.  
明日香点点头。当真耶离开后，明日香坐在长椅上。一阵寒意掠过她的身体。

'_He's alive. He's fine. He must. Right?'_  
“他还活着。他没事。他一定没事的，对吧？”

---

Shinji opened his eyes and once again saw the hospital ceiling. He didn't even try to get up.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，又一次看到了医院的白色天花板。他甚至没有尝试起身。

"You're awake, that's good. The doctor said you should rest."  
“你醒了，这很好。医生说你需要休息。”

He turned his head and saw Rei leave the room. His eyes began to turn glassy. After a while, he began to sob lightly.  
他转过头，看到绫波离开了房间。他的眼睛开始变得模糊。过了一会儿，他开始轻轻地啜泣。

"Release me please." "请放开我。"

He wiped his eyes with his hand.  
他用双手擦了擦眼睛。

"Asuka. Misato. Help me."  
"明日香。美里。救救我。"

The door to the room opened and Asuka peeked into the room. After a moment, she entered the room without looking at Shinji.  
房间的门打开了，明日香探头向里张望。片刻后，她没有看真嗣就走进了房间。

"I was just passing through and thought I'd take a look. I'm looking for Kaji."  
“我只是路过，顺便看看。我在找加持。”

"Help me Asuka." “帮帮我，明日香。”

She heard Shinji's cracking voice and became slightly concerned. When you looked at him you noticed his eyes red from tears. She walked over to his bed.  
她听到真嗣那沙哑的声音，不禁有些担心。当你看向他时，注意到他的眼睛因泪水而泛红。她走向他的床边。

"Help me Asuka. I need you."  
“帮帮我，明日香。我需要你。”

"Should I call the doctor?"  
“我应该叫医生来吗？”

She didn't know what was wrong with him or what to do. When she was close enough he extended his hands to her. As she sat on the edge of the bed he embraced her and began to cry.  
她不知道他怎么了，也不知道该怎么办。当她走近时，他向她伸出了双手。她坐在床边，他拥抱着她，开始哭泣。

"Help me Asuka. I need you."  
“帮帮我，明日香。我需要你。”

He repeated the same words quieter and quieter.  
他一遍遍重复着同样的话，声音越来越小。

"Shh, I'm here. Everything will be fine."  
“嘘，我在这儿。一切都会好起来的。”

She wasn't sure if she was more convinced by him or herself. She wondered whether to call the doctor. It didn't look like Shinji had any injuries. He was acting strangely. She began stroking his head in an effort to calm him down. This seemed to help.  
她不确定自己更相信他还是自己。她犹豫是否该叫医生。真嗣看起来并没有受伤。他的行为很奇怪。她开始抚摸他的头，试图让他平静下来。这似乎有些效果。

'_I need you.'_ “我需要你。”

She didn't know what was wrong with him, but it was nice to hear those words for some reason.  
她不知道他哪里不对劲，但不知为何，听到那些话感觉很好。

Her touch calmed him down. Then he realized he couldn't smell blood. Neither the smell nor the taste. He broke the embrace and raised his head. He wiped his eyes with his sleeve.  
她的触摸让他平静下来。然后他意识到他闻不到血的味道。无论是气味还是味道。他挣脱了拥抱，抬起头。他用袖子擦了擦眼睛。

"Asuka? Is that you?" “明日香？是你吗？”

"What? Are you feeling okay?"  
"什么？你感觉还好吗？"

Shinji leaned back. She didn't act strangely like in the dream he had. He thought that this time it was probably the real Asuka. At least that's what he hoped.  
真嗣向后靠了靠。她没有像他梦中的那样行为怪异。他想这次可能是真正的明日香。至少他是这么希望的。

"How did I get here?"  
"我是怎么来到这里的？"

"You don't remember?" "你不记得了？"

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"Your EVA went berserk and tore the angel apart from the inside."  
"你的 EVA 失控了，从内部将使徒撕裂。"

Shinji smiled gently. He didn't smell any blood. He was free. Free at last.  
真嗣温柔地笑了。他没有闻到任何血腥味。他自由了。终于自由了。

"You're creeping me out."  
“你吓到我了。”

"I'm just glad it's over."  
“我只是很高兴这一切结束了。”

She was relieved that Shinji had calmed down. Maybe she could do without calling a doctor after all.  
她松了一口气，因为真嗣已经平静下来。或许她终究可以不用叫医生。

"Why did you attack alone and didn't wait for us?"  
“你为什么独自攻击而不等我们？”

Again, the same question. Shinji didn't smell blood, but wondered if it was another dream after all. He pinched himself for reassurance. The pain seemed real.  
又是同样的问题。真嗣没有闻到血腥味，但怀疑这会不会又是一场梦。他为了确认而掐了自己一下。疼痛感似乎很真实。

He wasn't completely sure, but he didn't really know how he could find out if the dream was over. Perhaps Asuka's behavior would tell him.  
他并不完全确定，但他真的不知道如何才能弄清楚这个梦是否已经结束。或许明日香的行为会告诉他。

"I thought that if I was number one, I would impress others. That my father will praise me." He paused for a moment and added in an almost inaudible voice. "And that y- never mind."  
"我以为如果我是第一名，我会让别人印象深刻。我父亲会表扬我。"他停顿了一下，然后用几乎听不见的声音补充道。"还有，那- 算了。"

"You really are stupid." "你真的很蠢。"

"I know it was stupid. You won't understand. You didn't lose your mom and you didn't live alone."  
"我知道这很蠢。你不会懂的。你没有失去妈妈，也没有独自生活。"

His words struck her. She rose quickly from the bed.  
他的话刺痛了她。她迅速从床上起身。

"What?!" "什么？！"

Shinji didn't understand why Asuka had her voice raised. Had he said something wrong?  
真嗣不明白为什么明日香提高了嗓门。难道他说错了什么吗？

"Um, I heard Misato mention that your mother called. I didn't mean to eavesdrop."  
“呃，我听到美里提到你妈妈打电话来了。我不是故意偷听的。”

"You don't know anything about me!"  
“你根本不了解我！”

Angry, she ran out of the room.  
愤怒之下，她冲出了房间。

"No, wait!" “不，等等！”

Shinji lay down on the bed. It probably wasn't a dream after all.  
真嗣躺在床上，这可能终究不是一场梦。

---

"We're back." “我们回来了。”

No response. Misato entered the apartment along with Shinji. They could hear the TV on.  
没有回应。美里和真嗣走进了公寓，他们能听到电视的声音。

In the living room Asuka lied down looking at the TV. She turned around when she saw Shinji out of the corner of her eye.  
在客厅里，明日香躺着看电视。她用眼角余光瞥见真嗣，便转过头来。

"Our number one pilot is back." Asuka said in a mocking voice. "Did you reprimanded him?"  
"我们的头号飞行员回来了。" 明日香用嘲讽的语气说道，"你训斥他了吗？"

"He almost died. I think that's good enough, don't you think Asuka?"  
"他差点就死了。我觉得这已经足够了，你不觉得吗，明日香？"

Shinji kept looking at Asuka the whole time. He didn't know if she was angry or not. She was acting as usual.  
真嗣一直盯着明日香看。他不知道她是不是生气了。她的行为一如既往。

Misato took out some money and put it on the table. "Here you have some money to order dinner."  
美里拿出一些钱放在桌上。“这里有订晚餐的钱。”

"And what's the occasion?"  
“有什么特别的事吗？”

Asuka was well aware of what an opportunity this was. Or even two. The first was that Shinji had been rescued. The second is almost a tradition. After defeating the angel, Misato took them to ramen or hot springs. Asuka enjoyed those rare moments.  
明日香很清楚这是个多么难得的机会，甚至可以说是两个机会。第一是真嗣被救了。第二则几乎成了传统。每次击败使徒后，美里都会带他们去吃拉面或泡温泉。明日香很享受这些难得的时刻。

"I didn't have time to do any shopping. Why, would you rather I cook something?"  
"我还没来得及去买东西。怎么，你宁愿我来做点什么吗？"

"Shinji would regret getting out of the angel."  
"真嗣会后悔从使徒那里出来的。"

Asuka laughed. Actually, she had never tasted Misato's food. She had only heard from stories how bad Misato's cooking was. For as long as she can remember, it was Shinji who cooked the food.  
明日香笑了。实际上，她从未尝过美里做的食物。她只是从故事中听说过美里的厨艺有多糟糕。在她记忆中，一直都是真嗣在做饭。

"Very funny. I'm going out for a drink. See you guys later." Misato waved and walked out of the apartment.  
“真搞笑。我出去喝一杯。回头见，各位。”美里挥了挥手，走出了公寓。

Asuka got up from the floor and stood in front of Shinji. Her facial expression changed. Shinji noticed it. Was she still angry, but didn't want to show it in front of Misato?  
明日香从地板上站起来，站在真嗣面前。她的表情变了。真嗣注意到了。她还在生气吗，但不想在美里面前表现出来？

"I'm sor-" Shinji wanted to apologize, but was interrupted.  
“我很抱——”真嗣想道歉，但被打断了。

"She's not my mother." “她不是我妈妈。”

At first Shinji did not understand what she was talking about. He wondered what she meant.  
起初，真嗣并不明白她在说什么。他疑惑她指的是什么。

Seeing his confusion, Asuka continued. "She's my stepmother. My dad remarried after my mom died when I was little."  
看到他的困惑，明日香继续说道：“她是我继母。我妈妈在我小时候去世后，我爸爸再婚了。”

This fact of her life he did not know. It made him feel stupid. It comes out that she, like him, doesn't have a mother. He noticed the sadness on her face when she told him about it.  
这个她生活中的事实，他之前并不知晓。这让他感到自己很愚蠢。原来，她和一样，也没有母亲。当她向他讲述这件事时，他注意到了她脸上的悲伤。

"I didn't know, I'm sorry."  
“我不知道，对不起。”

"Now you know." She sighed. "Maybe I shouldn't have reacted that way."  
“现在你知道了。”她叹了口气。“也许我不该那样反应。”

There was an awkward silence. Shinji didn't know if she was still angry with him or not.  
一阵尴尬的沉默。真嗣不知道她是否还在生他的气。

"I enjoy your company and I don't want you to be angry with me."  
“我喜欢和你在一起，不想你生我的气。”

Then she did something Shinji didn't expect. Asuka came up to him and hugged him. He didn't know what was going on, but it felt good. He returned the hug.  
随后她做了真嗣未曾预料的事。明日香走到他面前，拥抱了他。他虽不明所以，但感觉很好。他也回抱了她。

"I also like having you around so don't do something so stupid again."  
"我也喜欢有你在身边，所以别再做那么蠢的事了。"

"I promise." "我保证。"

They stood like that for a long moment. Neither of them wanted to break the embrace.  
他们就这样站了很久，谁也不愿意打破这个拥抱。

'_He_ _doesn't smell of lavender.'_ She smiled to herself.  
'他没有薰衣草的味道。' 她暗自微笑。

"I guess we have something in common Asuka. If you would like to talk, I would be willing."  
"我想我们有些共同点，明日香。如果你愿意聊聊，我会很乐意。"

"Maybe someday." "也许有一天吧。"

Her stomach gurgled. She broke the embrace and blushed slightly. When she noticed how Shinji laughed, she laughed with him.  
她的肚子咕噜作响。她挣脱了拥抱，微微脸红。当她注意到真嗣在笑时，她也跟着笑了起来。

"I'll order food." Asuka grabbed the phone. "Oh, and if you tell someone about this."  
“我去点餐。”明日香抓起电话。“哦，还有，如果你把这事告诉别人。”

"You'll kill me. I know Asuka."  
“你会杀了我。我了解你，明日香。”

Before dialing the number, she decided to apologize to him.  
在拨打电话之前，她决定向他道歉。

"Forgive me for using the anniversary of your mother's death to kiss you."  
“请原谅我利用你母亲的忌日来吻你。”

"That's okay. Sorry that the kiss was weak."  
“没关系。抱歉那个吻太无力了。”

"And you're right to be sorry! I expect you'll do better next time."  
"而你确实应该感到抱歉！我希望你下次能做得更好。"

Asuka dialed a number and turned around.  
明日香拨了一个号码，然后转过身来。

'_Next time?'_ Shinji stood puzzled. He wondered what she meant by next time.  
'下次？' 真嗣困惑地站着。他不明白她所说的下次是什么意思。

She turned to him while covering the phone with her hand.  
她转向他，用手捂住电话。

"That brown noodles, they're called soba right?"  
“那种棕色的面条，是叫荞麦面吧？”

When he nodded she went back to ordering. As he watched her, he smiled. Just like during their sync training together.  
他点头后，她继续点餐。他看着她，笑了。就像他们一起进行同步训练时那样。

At that moment, he was happy. Truly happy.  
那一刻，他是快乐的。真正地快乐。
