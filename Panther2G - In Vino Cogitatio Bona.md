Asuka stared at the bottle on the counter and told the imaginary Shinji in her head to shut the fuck up. "This is your fault anyway, idiot. And it's my birthday, I do what I want."  
明日香盯着柜台上的瓶子，脑海中对那个虚构的真嗣吼道：“闭嘴吧你！反正这都是你的错，白痴。今天可是我的生日，我想干嘛就干嘛。”

The imaginary Shinji tried one more time to tell her this was a bad idea, but she ignored him and reached out to pick up the heavy green glass bottle.  
虚构的真嗣又尝试了一次告诉她这是个坏主意，但她置若罔闻，伸手去拿那个沉甸甸的绿色玻璃瓶。

The voice of caution in her head had not been all that strong to begin with, and was already heavily beaten down under the weight of the self-loathing and anger she'd been carrying around for the last two weeks. Everything she could have asked for, a one-on-one fight with an Angel, no First or Third to slow her down or steal the glory… and Zeruel had not just beaten her, but _humiliated_ her. The Angel hadn't even seemed rushed or like it even had to _exert_ itself to just brush her out of the way!  
她脑海中那微弱的谨慎之声，原本就不甚强烈，如今更是在过去两周积累的自厌与愤怒的重压下几近消弭。她本可以要求的一切，与使徒一对一的战斗，没有第一或第三适格者拖后腿或抢夺荣耀……然而零使徒不仅击败了她，还羞辱了她。那使徒甚至没有显得匆忙或需要费力，就轻而易举地将她扫到一边！

And then the stupid _Third_ had come waltzing back in and been the big hero! Asuka ground her teeth. Now everyone, even Misato, was doing nothing but focusing on him, all because he'd gotten himself stuck in Unit-01's Core!  
然后那个愚蠢的第三适格者又大摇大摆地回来了，成了大英雄！明日香咬牙切齿。现在所有人，甚至连美里，都只关注他，就因为他把自己困在了零一机体的核心里！

Which left Asuka here: Alone, pissed off, and ignored on her _birthday_. Because stupid Shinji and stupid Misato and stupid First.  
这让明日香陷入了：孤独、愤怒，还有在她生日这天被忽视。都是因为愚蠢的 Shinji、愚蠢的美里和愚蠢的第一适格者。

Asuka's free hand tightened into a fist and shook. Angry was good. Angry was better than the solitary, bitter tears that had been the rest of the day.  
明日香空着的那只手紧握成拳，颤抖着。愤怒是好的。愤怒总比整天独自流泪要好。

_Useless. Worthless. Unneeded.  
无用。无价值。不必要。_

Asuka violently shook away the evil, black whispers again, and carried the dark green bottle to the table. Misato might be pissed if she found out Asuka was getting into her good stuff, but _fuck her_ if she was going to ignore the Second Child on her birthday. "I'll just count this as her gift to me," Asuka said to the empty apartment. "She owes me for ignoring me all week. Leaving me here and forcing me to fend for myself. Nothing but delivery food and instant meals. I miss-"  
明日香再次猛烈地甩开那些邪恶的黑色低语，将那瓶深绿色的酒瓶拿到桌子上。美里要是发现明日香动了她的好酒，可能会生气，但要是她在生日这天忽视第二适格者，那就随她去吧。“我就当这是她送给我的礼物了，”明日香对着空荡荡的公寓说，“她欠我的，整整一周都无视我。把我留在这里，逼得我自力更生。除了外卖就是速食。我怀念——”

She bit off saying it out loud, but couldn't stop the thought from finishing in her head. '_I miss baka Shinji cooking me dinner.'_  
她咬住舌头没把话说出口，但脑海中的念头却无法停止。“我怀念笨蛋真嗣给我做饭。”

'_Can't even feed yourself. Useless.'_  
'连自己都喂不饱。没用。'

Asuka shook her head again, a sharp, jerky motion. Misato may have been a lousy guardian and a terrible role model, but she had shown Asuka many, many times at least one useful lesson: How to make the thoughts go away.  
明日香再次摇了摇头，动作干脆利落。美里或许是个糟糕的监护人和差劲的榜样，但她至少多次向明日香展示了一个有用的教训：如何让那些念头消失。

"And if it's good enough medicine for her nightly, it's good enough for me on my fucking fourteenth birthday," she said firmly.  
“既然这药对她晚上的安眠足够有效，那对我这该死的十四岁生日也足够了。”她坚定地说道。

She unscrewed the cap of the brand new bottle of Jägermeister and lifted it to her lips for a deep swig.  
她拧开那瓶崭新的野格酒瓶盖，举起瓶子深深地喝了一口。

Some people have referred to Jägermeister as 'bad decisions in a bottle'. Asuka didn't know what the Hell they were talking about. So far, this was the _best_ idea.  
有些人称野格酒为‘瓶中的糟糕决定’。明日香不知道他们在说什么鬼话。到目前为止，这是最好的主意。

She felt _great_. She was floaty and a little numb and everything was funny and dizzy and no more stupid voices in the back of her head telling her she was worthless and useless.  
她感觉棒极了。她飘飘然，有点麻木，一切都变得滑稽而眩晕，再也没有那些愚蠢的声音在脑海里说她无用和无价值了。

"I can see why Mishato likes this stuffff," she told the penguin. The penguin nodded and sipped at his second beer. "I am fllllloating, and don't give a shit no one is here. This is a party all by itself! Just us!"  
"我明白为什么美里喜欢这玩意儿了，"她对企鹅说。企鹅点点头，啜饮着他的第二杯啤酒。"我感觉飘飘然，谁也不在乎这里没人。这就是个派对，只有我们俩！"

The penguin nodded again, staring at a spot at least a meter to Asuka's left.  
企鹅再次点头，盯着至少在明日香左边一米远的地方。

"You're very agreeable. Such a good roommate. No arguments like Misato, no constant 'I'm sorry!' like the baka…"  
"你真好说话。真是个好室友。不像美里那样总是争吵，也不像那个笨蛋一样老是'对不起！'……"

'_No one greeting me when I come home. No one making a hot dinner for me at night and hot breakfast in the morning. No one watching my every move when I walk around in a towel after a shower, or in the shortest shorts and tightest tops I could find. No one jumping in a volcano to save me. No-'_  
‘我回家时没人迎接，晚上没人给我做热腾腾的晚餐，早上也没人准备热乎乎的早餐。我洗完澡裹着毛巾走来走去，或是穿上我能找到的最短的短裤和最紧的上衣时，没人盯着我的一举一动。没人会跳进火山来救我。不——’

"Oh fucking come on!" Asuka snarled, her good mood starting to dissipate. "I do not miss him! That'd be stupid! He's the stupid little boy that just gets in my way and steals the glory! Just because he's the only one who ever did anything for me, doesn't mean I…"  
“哦，真是够了！”明日香咆哮道，她的好心情开始消散。“我才不会想念他！那太蠢了！他就是那个总是碍事、抢走我荣耀的笨小孩！就因为他是我唯一一个为我做过什么的人，并不意味着我……”

She got up off the floor in front of the TV and stomped back to the kitchen. If she was starting to miss that idiot, she clearly needed more alcohol to stop that.  
她从电视前的地板上站起来，气冲冲地回到厨房。如果她开始想念那个白痴，那显然她需要更多的酒精来阻止这种念头。

There, Misato's 'Demon Killer' sake. She hoped it was stronger than the bottle of Jägermeister. 70 proof, what even is that? Bah!  
看，美里那瓶‘恶魔杀手’清酒。她希望这比那瓶野格酒劲儿大。70 度，那算什么？哼！

She poured herself a nice tumbler full of the clear liquid and tossed some of it back. "Ahhh, nice burn. Wait, shit… where did I leave the Jägermeister bottle? It wasn't empty, was it? Fuck."  
她给自己倒了一满杯清澈的液体，猛地灌了一口。“啊，够劲儿。等等，该死……我把野格酒瓶放哪儿了？不会已经空了吧？靠。”

She walked carefully back to the living room where the penguin was eyeing her. The floor was becoming increasingly unstable, so she flopped down next to the bottle still sitting on the floor. Yup, there was still about a quarter left in it. She took a drink right from the bottle to bring that down. An empty bottle was easier to make vanish than a partly full one back on the shelf.  
她小心翼翼地走回客厅，那只企鹅正盯着她看。地板越来越不稳，于是她一屁股坐在了还放在地上的酒瓶旁边。没错，里面还剩大约四分之一。她直接对着瓶口喝了一口，好让剩下的酒减少些。一个空瓶子比半满的瓶子更容易藏起来，放回架子上。

"And another thing!" she suddenly told the penguin. He looked startled at her outburst. "He's _stupid_! I kissed him and he just _stood there_! Like a pea-brained moron! He wouldn't even hold me! Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to find the nerve to try that? How could even an idiot like him miss a signal like 'I want to kiss'?! I mean," she paused to take another drink of the sake, "I tried before then, gave him a full on reeeeeeally good shot down my boobs when it was just him and me alone that one night! Like this!"  
“还有一件事！”她突然对企鹅说道。他听到她的爆发，显得有些惊慌。“他真蠢！我吻了他，他居然就站在那儿！像个脑袋空空的傻瓜！他甚至都不抱我一下！你知道我鼓起勇气去尝试那一下有多难吗？连他这种白痴怎么可能错过‘我想接吻’这种明显的信号？！我是说，”她停下来又喝了一口清酒，“在那之前我就试过，那天晚上就我们俩独处时，我给了他一个超级棒的胸部诱惑！就像这样！”

Asuka put the sake down and got on her hands and knees, letting her loose tank top droop open and show off her chest. Pen Pen stared, but didn't seem hugely impressed. He ducked his beak to take another sip of beer.  
明日香放下清酒，双手撑地跪坐下来，宽松的背心随之垂落，露出她的胸部。Pen Pen 盯着看，但似乎并不怎么印象深刻。他低下喙又喝了一口啤酒。

"Fine, what do you know, you stupid bird? These are _fantastic_ tits! He should have been staring _more_! I'm the hottest girl he knows! But he just… just… he didn't! I even told him to come in with that bullshit about the Walls of Jericho! And he just… He didn't do anything! He… fuck, I was _enjoying_ that kiss! So was he! I just… It was so good. He smelled so good, felt so good, _tasted_ so good… why wouldn't he hold me?!"  
“好吧，你这蠢鸟懂什么？这可是极品美胸！他应该多看几眼的！我可是他认识的最火辣的女孩！但他就是……就是……没反应！我甚至用那关于耶利哥城墙的鬼话叫他进来！而他……他什么都没做！他……该死，我享受那个吻！他也一样！我只是……太美妙了。他闻起来那么好，感觉那么好，尝起来那么好……为什么他不抱紧我？！”

Her sudden demand rocked the penguin back. He hurriedly sucked down the last of his can of beer and ran to the kitchen for another. He came waddling back quickly, driven either by a strong desire for Asuka to resume her rant, or a powerful need for more booze before he listened to more ranting. Asuka chose to interpret it as the former.  
她突如其来的要求让企鹅往后一晃。他急忙吸干了最后一口啤酒，冲进厨房再去拿一罐。他摇摇摆摆地迅速回来，或许是出于对明日香继续发泄的强烈渴望，或是想在听更多抱怨前再喝点酒。明日香选择将其理解为前者。

"Sho! You shee! He was _good_! Kissing him was _fun_! It felt _so good_! And… and… he _didn't do anything_! He just stood there! Why didn't he grab me? Hold me? I'd have ruined him for all other women if he had! _Ruined_! You have no idea how hard I'd have messed him up! He'd be seeing stars for days! I'd have loved him so hard… He'd never had looked at that blue bitch ever again in his life!" She grabbed the penguin and held him up off his feet. "I'd have been the greatest love he'd ever have _period_!" She shook the penguin, who's eyes started to spin. "I'd have loved him _so much!_ How does he not see that?! I should go give that idiot a piece of my mind!"  
"瞧！你看到了吧！他很棒！亲他真有趣！感觉太好了！而且……而且……他什么都没做！他就站在那儿！为什么他不抱我？搂我？如果他那样做，我早就让他对其他女人失去兴趣了！彻底毁了！你根本不知道我能把他搞得多惨！他得几天都眼冒金星！我会狠狠爱他……他这辈子再也不会看那蓝婊子一眼！" 她抓起企鹅，把它举离地面。"我会成为他一生中最伟大的爱_没有之一_!" 她摇晃着企鹅，它的眼睛开始打转。"我会那么爱他！他怎么就看不出来？！我得去找那个傻瓜理论一番！"

Pen Pen nodded limply. He might have just been wobbling his head back and forth from the shaking. Asuka and the Jägermeister decided it was agreement. "Right! You know, that's a great idea! I should do that right the Hell now! What time is it?"  
企鹅点点头，软绵绵地。它可能只是因为摇晃而前后晃动脑袋。明日香和猎人认为这是同意的意思。“对啊！你知道吗，这主意真棒！我应该现在就去做！几点了？”

A quick dash to the kitchen confirmed it was 2130. "Right! Perfect time to go talk to his dumb ass! Let's go!" Pen Pen did not disagree with her.

She quickly threw the remaining Jägermeister into a travel mug and most of the rest of the sake into a thermos. She obviously needed the help in thinking, since her thoughts were marvelously clear right now. She was starting to understand why Misato did this constantly. It made everything so clear!  
她迅速将剩下的野格酒倒入旅行杯，又将大部分清酒倒进保温瓶。显然，她需要借助这些来思考，因为此刻她的思绪异常清晰。她开始明白为什么美里总是这么做。这确实让一切变得如此明了！

She was making the best decisions. So smart. The Section 2 driver in the detail outside the apartment didn't even argue with her when she demanded he drive her down to NERV HQ right the fuck now.  
她做出了最佳决策。如此聪明。负责公寓外警戒的第二分部司机甚至没有和她争辩，当她要求他立刻开车送她去 NERV 总部时。

She took a sip or three from the thermos on the way. It took a good twenty minutes to even get her down far enough to see the NERV HQ pyramid. Fortunately, the Jägermeister kept her from sobering up.  
她在路上喝了好几口保温瓶里的酒。光是降到足够低以看清 NERV 总部金字塔的高度就花了整整二十分钟。幸运的是，野格酒让她没有清醒过来。

The driver dropped her at the gates of HQ. Her ID as a Pilot got her to the Evangelion cages without anyone even asking why. She didn't bother with changing out of the school uniform she'd thrown on before leaving the apartment. It was good enough to walk around NERV HQ without anyone asking awkward questions like 'why are you here at this hour?' or 'why are you weaving and wobbling like someone with more than a liter of straight liquor in them?'  
司机将她放在总部大门前。作为驾驶员的 ID 让她顺利进入福音战士的机库，无人过问缘由。她懒得换下离开公寓前胡乱套上的校服。这身打扮在 NERV 总部四处走动已足够，不会有人问些尴尬的问题，比如“你为何在这个时间来这儿？”或是“你怎么像喝了一升纯酒似的摇摇晃晃？”

The Evangelion Cages spread out in front of her. Her own gorgeous, wonderful, beautiful, amazing Unit-02, the first proper Production Model Evangelion in the world was in it's bay, repaired and ready to go, scrubbed and fixed of all signs of it being disarmed and beheaded a few weeks ago. This was good. But what she'd come here for was to scream truth and instruction at a certain baka.  
眼前的 EVA 笼格一字排开。她自己的华丽、绝妙、美丽、惊人的零二号机，作为世界上首台正式量产型 EVA，正静静躺在格纳库中，已修复完毕，整装待发，所有几周前被解除武装、斩首的痕迹都已清理修复。这很好。但她来此的目的，是为了向某个笨蛋吼出真相与指示。

She marched her way over to Unit-01's bay. The gantry for Unit-01, usually kept at chin-level on the enormous mecha, was now kept at chest-level, for whatever reason. This meant that instead of talking to the Evangelion's face, Asuka would be yelling at its breastplate, but whatever. This was fine. She was the Second Child, elite Pilot. She could handle anything, even a minor difference in position in front of humanity's greatest weapon system.  
她大步流星地走向零一机组的停泊区。通常保持在巨型机体下巴高度的零一号登机桥，不知为何现在被调整到了胸口高度。这意味着，阿斯卡不再是与福音战士的面孔对话，而是对着它的胸甲喊话，但无所谓。这没什么大不了的。她是第二适格者，精英驾驶员。她能应对任何情况，哪怕是站在人类最强大武器系统前的一点位置差异。

"Hey!" she began her insightful oratory. "Hey you, you fucking moron! I'm talking to you, baka Shinji! Yeah, you, the idiot who can't even tell when a girl is trying to tell him she's interested! You blind, stupid, _stupid_ boy! How can you be so cute yet so _dumb_? I'm practically _throwing_ myself at you, shoving my tits in your face, telling you to kiss me, and yet you still _don't get it?_" She pounded on the railing of the steel catwalk, spittle spraying towards the red, glassy surface of the Core, just in front of her face. Or rather, she pounded at the air where a railing _should_ have been if NERV had ever heard of OSHA or any other competent safety regulator. What she ended up doing was wildly flailing her hands at the air where a railing might have been, but mostly just nearly overbalanced herself into the titanic amounts of LCL that Unit-01 stood chest-deep in. She balled her fist and punched it right into the Core's surface.  
“嘿！”她开始了她的深刻演讲。“嘿，你这个该死的白痴！我在跟你说话呢，笨蛋真嗣！没错，就是你，那个连女孩想告诉他她对他有意思都看不出来的傻瓜！你这个瞎了眼的、蠢得无可救药的男孩！你怎么能这么可爱却又这么笨呢？我几乎是在把自己扔给你，把我的胸部往你脸上蹭，叫你吻我，可你还是不明白？”她用力捶打着钢铁天桥的栏杆，唾沫飞溅向她面前红色、光滑的核心表面。或者说，她捶打的是本应有栏杆存在的地方，如果 NERV 听说过 OSHA 或其他任何合格的安全监管机构的话。结果她只是在可能存在栏杆的空气中疯狂挥舞双手，差点让自己失去平衡，掉进初号机站立其中、胸口深的 LCL 里。她握紧拳头，一拳砸向核心表面。

There was a dull 'klonk' of her knuckles hitting the solid crystalline surface, but the huge mecha did not react otherwise. "Listen, you fucking dumbass, when a girl comes home from a date early to spend time with you, compliments your goddam amazing cello playing, and then _demands you kiss her_, that's what we call in Germany 'a FUCKING HINT'! You stupid, sexy, cute, hot, sensitive IDIOT! You're supposed to hold me! Kiss me! Love me! Do you have any goddamn idea how hard it was for me to play it casual and ask you to kiss me?! Really damn hard! And now you think you need to upstage me, save the day, and then get stuck in this stupid Core and be a bloody drama queen and attention whore for weeks? Shinji, you get your firm little buns out here RIGHT FUCKING NOW and kiss me _properly_, or I will kick. Your. Ass!"  
她的指节重重地敲在坚硬的晶体表面上，发出沉闷的“咚”声，但那庞大的机甲并未有其他反应。“听着，你这个该死的蠢货，当一个女孩早早结束约会回家陪你，夸赞你那该死的美妙大提琴演奏，然后要求你吻她，这在德国我们称之为‘一个该死的暗示’！你这个愚蠢、性感、可爱、火辣、敏感的白痴！你应该抱紧我！吻我！爱我！你知道我得有多努力才能表现得随意，开口让你吻我吗？！真的非常难！而现在你却以为你需要抢我的风头，拯救这一天，然后被困在这愚蠢的核心里，像个血淋淋的戏剧女王和注意力乞丐一样闹腾几周？真嗣，你给我立刻滚出来，好好吻我，否则我就要踢你的屁股了！”

She stepped back a meter to give the Core a solid side-kick, her full body weight behind it. "You hear me?! Now! I didn't haul my perky butt all the way down here just to yell at this stupid robot! You get your ass out here _right now_ and HOLD ME!" She stumbled forward when the treacherous steel walkway wobbled under her rock-steady feet and found her face somehow mashed against the Core's surface. "Stupid bastard. What am I supposed to do with you not here? Who else is going to love me?"  
"她后退一步，用尽全身力气对核心侧踢一脚。“你听到了吗？！现在！我可不是为了对着这个愚蠢的机器人大喊大叫才一路拖着我的翘臀下来的！你马上给我出来，抱紧我！”她踉跄着向前，当那不靠谱的钢制走道在她稳如磐石的脚下摇晃时，她的脸不知怎么地就贴在了核心的表面上。“愚蠢的混蛋。你不在这里，我该怎么办？还有谁会爱我？”

There was a wet, gooey noise like a semi-liquid lump of snot the size of a watermelon being squeezed out a hole half as large. Asuka felt the world spin around her and the hard metal surface of the walkway slam into her back. Her vision filled with stars when the back of her head smacked into the floor. When she finally managed to blink her eyes clear, she was still distracted by the insistent sensations from the rest of her body that there was a very slimy, warm, heavy weight between her legs and on top of her. Under other circumstances this might have been very pleasant and welcome, but at the moment it was mostly confusing, since she'd been upright until a moment ago. And alone.  
"一阵湿漉漉、黏糊糊的声音传来，像是半液态的鼻涕块，有西瓜那么大，从一个只有一半大的洞里挤出来。明日香感到世界在她周围旋转，坚硬的金属走道猛地撞上她的背部。她的视野中满是星星，当她的后脑勺猛击地面时。当她终于设法眨眼让视线清晰时，她仍然被身体其他部位的持续感觉所困扰，发现有什么黏糊糊、温暖而沉重的东西压在她两腿之间和上方。在其他情况下，这可能会非常愉快和受欢迎，但此刻它主要是令人困惑，因为她直到刚才还站着，而且是一个人。”

Now she was not. 现在她不在了。

There was a Third Child on top of her. This was deeply confusing, but since that _was_ what she'd just been demanding and his eyes were fluttering open, Asuka concluded that the universe and/or Shinji had listened for once, and she had gotten what she wanted. So she did what she said she'd been here to do.  
有一个第三适格者压在她身上。这让她深感困惑，但既然这是她刚刚要求的，而且他的眼睛正微微睁开，明日香得出结论，宇宙和/或真嗣这次终于听见了她的请求，她得到了她想要的。于是她做了她来这里要做的事。

She freed her hands, grabbed onto Shinji's head, lined up his face, and proceeded to kiss his brains out.  
她松开双手，抓住真嗣的头，对准他的脸，开始狂吻不止。

Shinji's barely coherent "Guwah?" of surprise was countered by Asuka's firmly confident, if mostly garbled "Mine. Mine mine mine mine love me love you love me love you freaking idiot love you." Garbled due to her mouth being 99% occupied at the moment. Shinji didn't seem to be marshaling many objections, though. After the first several seconds he seemed to accept his fate, and began tentatively kissing her back. This pleased Asuka. However, about a minute into the process her body decided to inform her that it was 300% drunk and had just been bonked on the head pretty good, and was going to pass out right now kthanx bai.  
真嗣那含糊不清的“呃？”惊讶声被明日香坚定自信、尽管大部分含糊不清的“我的。我的我的我的我爱我你爱我爱我你这个笨蛋爱你。”所回应，因为她的嘴此刻 99%都被占用了。不过，真嗣似乎并没有太多异议。几秒钟后，他似乎接受了命运，开始试探性地回吻她。这让明日香很高兴。然而，大约一分钟后，她的身体决定告诉她，它已经醉得 300%，刚刚还狠狠地被撞了头，现在就要昏过去了，谢谢再见。

"ohgodIwantodiemyheadddddddbuh?" Asuka slurred into the pillow. Her eye cracked open, and she immediately regretted it. The lights were much too loud. "Turn them offffffffff!" she demanded at a miniscule whisper. Any louder would have made her head pound even more.  
"哦天哪我想死我的头啊啊啊啊啊啊啊？" 明日香含糊地对着枕头嘟囔。她勉强睁开一只眼，随即就后悔了。灯光刺眼得要命。"把它们关掉啊啊啊啊啊！" 她用微不可闻的气声要求道。再大声一点头就要炸了。

The lights, sadly, persisted in staying on.  
灯光，可悲地，执意保持着亮着。

Her mouth felt like the Sahara. She stuck one hand out from under the covers she'd pulled protectively over her head and blindly fumbled around near the side of the bed. If this was her room, there should be a glass of water somewhere on the side-table.  
她的嘴巴干得像撒哈拉沙漠。她从紧紧裹在头上的被子里伸出一只手，在床边盲目地摸索着。如果这是她的房间，床头柜上应该有杯水。

Apparently, this was not her room, since the side-table was bare. She risked raising the blanket enough to look.  
显然，这不是她的房间，因为床头柜空无一物。她鼓起勇气掀开被子一角，向外张望。

The piercing light of late morning stabbed her right in the eyeballs, but did reveal a covered glass of water further away on the side-table than her blind fumbles had reached. She desperately grabbed the glass and greedily sucked at the straw. Only a moment later did enough of her brain power up to remind her to look around.  
刺眼的正午阳光直射她的眼球，却也揭示了在她盲目摸索之外，边桌上那杯被遮盖的水。她急切地抓住杯子，贪婪地吮吸着吸管。直到片刻之后，她的大脑才恢复足够的功能，提醒她环顾四周。

She was in a standard NERV hospital bed, a handful of medical sensors taped to the skin on her left forearm. Shinji was laying in the next bed over.  
她躺在 NERV 标准医院的病床上，左手臂的皮肤上贴着几片医疗传感器。真嗣就躺在隔壁的病床上。

_Shinji was laying in the-  
真嗣正躺在那-_

"Shinj-OOOOOWWWW ow ow ow ow my head!" she said, sitting upright. "What the fuck happened? How did I get- Shinji! Where the- how the?! What?! What? Huh? Shinji! Answer me! I-" She paused her careful inquiry to lean over the other side of the bed and vomit a string of bile and unpleasant liquids onto the floor. "On second thought, please just kill me."  
“疼疼疼疼疼，我的头！”她坐直身子说道，“到底发生了什么？我怎么——真嗣！这是哪儿——怎么回事？！什么？！什么？啊？真嗣！回答我！我——”她暂停了小心翼翼的询问，侧身向床的另一边俯身，将一串胆汁和令人不快的液体吐到了地板上。“再想一想，还是请直接杀了我吧。”

"Asuka!" Shinji sat up himself, the sheets falling away from his bare chest. "You're awake! I… um… what happened? I was… I was in… I remember my mother and… you were yelling at me?"  
"明日香！" 真嗣猛地坐起身，床单从他赤裸的胸前滑落。"你醒了！我……呃……发生了什么？我之前……我在……我记得我妈妈和……你在对我大喊大叫？"

"Urk." Asuka wiped at her mouth and took another drink of the water to wash her mouth out. "The yelling at you part I believe. The rest… How did I get _here_? I was in the apartment, alone, and I… I… had a drink?"  
“呃。”明日香擦了擦嘴，又喝了一口水漱口。“对你大吼大叫那部分我相信。剩下的……我是怎么到这儿来的？我一个人在公寓里，然后我……我……喝了一杯？”

"Oh, you had more than 'a drink', Asuka," Misato commented dryly, stepping into the room. "You had an entire bottle of Jägermeister and most of a bottle of my good Demon Killer sake. You owe me for those. On the upside, you somehow freed Shinji-kun from Unit-01, and gained yourself a boyfriend, which is pretty impressive for one night's work. Congratulations."  
“哦，你可不止‘喝了一杯’，明日香，”美里干巴巴地评论道，走进房间。“你喝了一整瓶野格酒，还有我那瓶上好的恶魔杀手清酒的一大半。你得赔我。不过，你居然设法把真嗣从初号机里救了出来，还给自己找了个男朋友，一晚上干成这些事，真是挺了不起的。恭喜啊。”

"_Boyfriend_?!" Asuka and Shinji said in concert.  
"男朋友？！" 明日香和真嗣异口同声地说。

"Yes, boyfriend. You _did_ threaten to 'stab you in the _face_' if I tried to separate you when we were wheeling you both up here, so I thought we should let you stay together," Misato said, grinning. She tossed the clipboard aside that she'd come in with and gave Shinji a fierce hug.  
“是的，男朋友。你威胁说如果我试图在推你们上来时分开你们，就要‘往你脸上捅一刀’，所以我想我们应该让你们待在一起。”美里笑着说。她把进来的夹板扔到一边，给了真嗣一个紧紧的拥抱。

She then turned to Asuka and gave her one just as intense. "And you brought him back. Thank you," she whispered in Asuka's ear. "You are the most amazing, brilliant Pilot in the world! Thank you thank you thank you!"  
随后她转向明日香，同样热烈地拥抱了她。“是你把他带回来的。谢谢你，”她在明日香耳边低语。“你是世界上最了不起、最出色的驾驶员！谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你！”

Misato stepped back and picked up the clipboard again. "So… we've got a million questions for you once you feel better. But for now… I'm going to tell everyone you're still asleep for a couple more hours, and let you two talk. I'll go get you some food and a couple of painkillers for Asuka. Have fun."  
Misato 退后一步，再次拿起夹纸板。“那么……等你感觉好些了，我们有一百万个问题要问你。但眼下……我会告诉所有人你还需要再睡几个小时，让你们俩聊聊。我去给你弄点吃的，再给 Asuka 拿几片止痛药。玩得开心。”

Misato made a quick exit, giggling madly. Asuka was left staring at the closing door, because that was easier than looking Shinji in the eye. Bits of last night were starting to bubble back up in her mind.  
Misato 匆匆离去，疯狂地咯咯笑着。Asuka 则呆呆地盯着正在关闭的门，因为比起直视 Shinji 的眼睛，这样更容易些。昨晚的一些片段开始在她脑海中浮现。

"Um… boyfriend?" Shinji said hesitantly.  
“呃……男朋友？” 真嗣犹豫地说。

"It seemed like a good idea at the time?" Asuka ventured.  
"当时看来是个好主意？" 明日香试探道。

**Author's Note, 31DEC21:** This was originally meant to be a Asuka's Birthday fic, but I held on publishing it until now to enter it into a AsuShin Winter Fic contest. Somehow, I tied for 9th. I thought I'd do better. On the plus side, now I can post one last AsuShin shot of the year, and a belated Asuka Birthday present.  
作者留言，2021 年 12 月 31 日：这篇文原本是为明日香生日而作，但我一直等到现在才发布，以便参加一个明日香与真嗣的冬季小说比赛。不知怎么的，我并列第九。我本以为会表现得更好。不过，好处是现在我可以发布今年最后一篇明日香与真嗣的故事，也算是给明日香迟来的生日礼物了。

For those who don't want to google it, the title is Latin for 'In Wine (booze) Are Good Ideas'. :)  
对于不想去谷歌搜索的人，这个标题在拉丁语中意为“在酒（酒精）中，好点子涌现”。 :)
