### Prologue: Thoughts Are Free
"I don't want to die."  
"我不想死。"

She says the words over and over because they are true, she doesn't want to die. That wasn't what she had meant by laying down in that bombed out ruin days before, staring blankly up at the sky through shattered ceilings. She hadn't wanted to die, she just wanted her reason to live back. And now, having found it within the Evangelion at the bottom of the lake, she bursts out of the water feeling immortal.  
她一遍遍重复这句话，因为这是真的，她不想死。几天前，她躺在那片被炸毁的废墟中，透过破碎的天花板茫然地望着天空，那时她并不是想死，她只是想要回活下去的理由。而现在，她在湖底的福音战士中找到了它，从水中冲出时，她感觉自己仿佛不朽。

Minutes later, she's pinned down by the spear, looking up at the sky again. He hadn't come to her. No help at all had come, but they did, the nine white-winged croaking figures circling above her. She can hardly make them out for all the blood fouling up her entry plug.  
几分钟后，她被长矛钉住，再次仰望天空。他没有来救她。没有任何援助到来，但它们出现了，那九个长着白色翅膀、嘎嘎叫的生物在她的上方盘旋。她几乎看不清它们，因为她的插入栓里满是血污。

"I'll kill you." "我要杀了你。"

Pain. Stabbing, slicing pain, the cold burn of a clean cut. Pain beyond all senses and without relief. Then a dim presence beside her, a popping release, and the pain ends along with the world. The reality of her final experiences ends, but the memory of the pain remains, a relentless now that persists in happening.  
痛苦。刺骨的、切割般的痛苦，冰冷而清晰的伤口灼烧感。超越所有感官、无法缓解的痛苦。随后，一个模糊的存在出现在她身旁，一声爆裂的释放，痛苦与世界一同终结。她最后经历的现实结束了，但痛苦的记忆依旧留存，一种持续发生的无情现实。

Her mind retreats from its myopic focus on the bloody task she had failed to conclude. She sees the new plane of existence to be a barren, narrow world. A world of his own creation. She senses his presence as she's pulled down by a force as irresistible as gravity. He's insistent, pleading, and far, far too late. He bears her backwards into his own memories, again and again, bringing little to offer and demanding much of her.  
她的思绪从对那血腥任务失败的狭隘关注中退缩。她看到这个新存在的平面是一个荒凉、狭窄的世界。一个由他创造的世界。她感觉到他的存在，就像被不可抗拒的重力拉下一样。他坚持不懈，恳求着，却来得太晚太晚。他带着她一次次退回到他自己的记忆中，提供的甚少，却向她索取甚多。

"All you ever do is hurt me."  
"你一直以来只会伤害我。"

He begs for a different answer each time, and when he doesn't get it he begins the scene from the top. It's the point where he knows something went wrong in his own life, when he failed to pull a lever that might have moved the Earth onto a different course. What those moments meant to her never crossed his mind, not even now.  
他每次都恳求一个不同的答案，而当他得不到时，他便从头开始这一幕。这是他意识到自己生活中出了差错的地方，当他未能拉动那个可能将地球推向不同轨道的杠杆时。那些时刻对她意味着什么，他从未想过，即使现在也没有。

"Pathetic." "可悲。"

She hates him for calling out for anybody to help him. He gives up so easily. She wonders if he even realizes that she's there with him at all, or if he imagines himself playing out a private game of self-pity.  
她讨厌他向任何人呼救。他放弃得太轻易了。她想知道他是否意识到她一直在他身边，或者他是否想象自己在自怜的私人游戏中独自演绎。

"No."

It doesn't hurt. His hands aren't real and she can't truly feel them around her neck. She knows that the two of them are dead so his violence fails to achieve anything just as his words failed. By words or by actions, he says the same as he always has. She waits to return again to the beginning. Denying him feels good. If this is their fate, if this is their future, so be it, she will deny him over and over, she will stand in opposition to him and everybody else for all time. She will remain forever, one and alone, Asuka Langley Soryu.  
这并不痛。他的手并非真实，她无法真正感受到它们环绕在她的脖子上。她知道他们两人都已死去，所以他的暴力和言语一样徒劳无功。无论是言语还是行动，他说的始终如一。她等待着再次回到起点。拒绝他感觉很好。如果这是他们的命运，如果这是他们的未来，那就这样吧，她会一次又一次地拒绝他，她会永远站在他和其他所有人的对立面。她将永远存在，独自一人，明日香·兰格雷。

His thoughts grow madder and his attention turns elsewhere. She is alone, she drifts away on a cresting wave of new voices, surprised and screaming. The noise is unbearable so she lets herself sink down into the depths. Imprisoned in the tomb of disquieted souls, their thoughts pushing into her and pulling her apart, she recalls a lullaby Mama used to sing.  
他的思绪变得疯狂，注意力转向别处。她独自一人，随着新声音的汹涌浪潮漂流，惊讶而尖叫。噪音难以忍受，于是她让自己沉入深渊。被囚禁在不安灵魂的坟墓中，他们的思绪侵入她，将她撕裂，她回忆起妈妈曾经唱过的摇篮曲。

"Die Gedanken sind frei... wer kann sie erraten..."  
"思想是自由的...谁能猜透它..."

Notes: 注释：

I decided to revisit this fic that I wrote a couple of years ago after seeing the recent theatrical screening of The End of Evangelion. Twice! It was a great experience to see it on a big screen, and it felt just as fresh—and as astounding—as it was when I watched it the first time around. Once again, I was drawn into the tragedy of Asuka's journey and moved by her choice to return from the sea. I found myself asking why all over again.  
在最近两次观看《新世纪福音战士剧场版：终》的影院放映后，我决定重温几年前写的这篇同人作品。在大银幕上观看是一次极佳的体验，感觉就像第一次观看时那样新鲜和震撼。我再次被明日香旅程的悲剧所吸引，并为她选择从海中归来的决定所感动。我再次自问这一切是为何。

Although I am pleased with how it originally turned out, there were always some things I wish I had gone back to revise or had planned out better, particularly the earlier parts where I wasn't sure where I was going with the story. I guess there's no time like the present to give this a shot. We'll see how it goes.  
虽然我对原作的成果感到满意，但总有些地方我希望能够回去修改或更好地规划，尤其是故事早期的部分，当时我并不确定故事的走向。我想，没有比现在更好的时机来尝试修改了。我们拭目以待进展如何。

### Asuka Discarnate
Crumpled up and abandoned, the former Evangelion pilot Asuka Langley Soryu laid on the floor of Misato's kitchen. The room was thoroughly trashed. The table and chairs were overturned and broken apart. Asuka laid where she had been left for dead after her sole companion, Shinji Ikari, discarded her in favor of more apocalyptic ambitions. She didn't know how long it had been. It felt like only seconds ago, but it could have easily been centuries or longer. She was aware of existing in a ceaseless present time.  
皱巴巴地被遗弃，前福音战士驾驶员惣流·明日香·兰格雷躺在美里厨房的地板上。房间被彻底毁坏。桌椅被掀翻并拆散。明日香躺在她被遗弃的地方，她的唯一同伴碇真嗣为了更末日的野心而抛弃了她。她不知道已经过去了多久。感觉就像几秒钟前，但也可能已经是几个世纪甚至更久。她意识到自己存在于一个无休止的现在时态中。

She felt something wet on her toes and recoiled. Making a sudden movement helped shake her into a higher level of awareness. She rolled herself into a half-upright position. Her feet had touched a puddle of spilled coffee, now cold. She remembered everything.  
她感觉到脚趾上有湿漉漉的东西，便缩了回去。突然的动作帮助她恢复了更高的警觉。她将自己卷成半坐的姿势。她的脚触到了一滩洒出的咖啡，现在已经凉了。她记起了所有的事情。

Everything meant in its most holistic sense. She was one of billions of undulating human minds swirling around in a singular multiplicity. The feeling of relative insignificance was not altogether new to her. Asuka hated herself. The vivid awareness of her billionth's share of human consciousness presented her with a particular sense of perspective. She had always sought to place herself at the center of everything, but there was no place of honor in the new shapeless world with no internal boundaries.  
一切都是从最全面的意义上来说的。她是数十亿波动的人类思维中的一部分，共同构成了一个单一的多重体。这种相对渺小的感觉对她来说并不陌生。明日香讨厌自己。她对自己在人类意识中所占的亿万分之一份额有着清晰的认识，这给她带来了一种特殊的角度。她总是试图将自己置于一切的中心，但在这个没有内部界限、形态不定的新世界中，并没有荣誉之地。

She felt her own mind shining through a prism that refracted what made up the whole of herself into every color of the human experience. The prying turned into abrasion, a scraping away of her wholeness into digestible component chunks.  
她感觉到自己的心灵透过一个棱镜闪耀，这个棱镜将构成她整体的每一个部分折射成人类经验的每一种色彩。这种窥探变成了磨损，将她的完整性一点点剥离成可消化的组成部分。

Asuka felt a billion other billionths of the new being pressing in upon her, too. Their rapturous glee at seeing her for who she was horrified her, their erotic bliss with their new-found intimacy disgusted her. They pried into every seam and pulled her apart along every hatred, fear, anxiety, loneliness, and the empty place for love. They held each aspect of herself up to their faces like mirrors. In so many words, in languages Asuka did not know but could now understand, they called out:  
明日香也感受到了这个新生命亿万分之一中的亿万分之一在向她逼近。他们见到真实的她时所表现出的狂喜令她恐惧，他们因新发现的亲密而产生的情欲快感令她厌恶。他们探查她内心的每一道裂缝，沿着每一种仇恨、恐惧、焦虑、孤独以及爱的空缺将她撕裂。他们将她自身的每一个方面举到面前，如同镜子一般。用明日香并不知晓却能理解的语言，他们呼喊道：

**You are me, too. We feel the same. We are more alike than we ever knew.  
你也是我，我们感受相同。我们比以往所知的更为相似。**

"You don't understand me! Nobody can understand me! Get out of my mind!"  
“你不懂我！没人能懂我！从我的脑海里滚出去！”

Asuka pushed herself up against a kitchen cabinet and coughed hard. She tasted coppery LCL come up which she spat onto the floor. She wiped her mouth on the stolen yellow shirt she wore.  
明日香用力撑起身体，靠在厨房的橱柜上，剧烈地咳嗽起来。她尝到了带有铜味的 LCL 涌上喉咙，随即吐在了地板上。她用偷来的黄色衬衫擦了擦嘴。

"Where'd you go?" she groaned. "Come finish the job. You stupid coward. You never finish anything off! Except yourself!"  
“你跑哪儿去了？”她呻吟着，“回来把事情做完啊。你这个愚蠢的懦夫。你从来不会把事情做完！除了你自己！”

Asuka could feel his absence even out of all the billions.  
即使在这亿万生灵之中，明日香也能感受到他的缺席。

She surveyed the upended ruin of their home. She felt responsible for it. Responsibility swelled into a perverse sense of satisfaction. This had been her work. It had taken her a lot of time and tears to get here.  
她审视着他们家园翻覆的废墟。她觉得对此负有责任。责任感膨胀成一种扭曲的满足感。这一切都是她的杰作。她为此付出了大量的时间和泪水。

She had finally proven herself right. After all those false starts, false hopes, and one terrible kiss, Asuka had proven categorically to herself for all time that the Shinji she needed—had thought she needed—did not exist. Could not exist. She had given him every opportunity.  
她终于证明了自己的正确。经历了那么多次的徒劳起步、虚幻的希望，以及那一次糟糕的吻，明日香确凿无疑地向自己证明了，她曾经以为需要的那个真嗣——根本不存在。也不可能存在。她已经给了他所有的机会。

"He'd rather jerk off by himself than hold me."  
“他宁愿自己解决，也不愿抱我。”

She ruminated on those words. When thrown at him, they hit like bullets. The blowback burned her, also. She bore witness to his memories of the act, many of them simultaneously, passed into her through the bond of Instrumentality. She rubbed her neck.  
她反复思索着那些话。当这些话朝他抛去时，它们如同子弹般击中了他。反弹的冲击也灼伤了她。她见证了他的记忆，许多记忆同时涌入，通过人类补完计划的纽带传递给她。她揉了揉自己的脖子。

"I can't believe I believed all this time I might be more to him. That's what was behind all his stupid smiles and his stupid 'sorry's'."  
我真不敢相信，我一直以为我对他来说可能更重要。这就是他那些愚蠢的笑容和愚蠢的'对不起'背后的原因。

Another memory that wasn't her own came over her. It was the ghost of his voice calling out in the new world of introspection: "You're the only one for me!"  
又一个不属于她的记忆涌上心头。那是他在内省的新世界中呼唤的幽灵般的声音：“你是我唯一的人！”

"Liar!" she hissed back. He had begged for anybody to save him when she refused him, so anybody else would have done in the end. Asuka was proven right.  
"骗子！"她低声回斥。他曾恳求任何人来救他，当她拒绝时，最终任何人都可以。事实证明，明日香是对的。

"Help me, save me!" called out from her memory.  
"救救我，救救我！"她的记忆中回响着这样的呼喊。

"As if that would flatter me into forgiving what you did," she growled. "Conceited little boy. Jerking off to the whole world. They never asked you to do this. And then what did you go and do, huh?"  
"好像这就能让我原谅你所做的一切似的，"她咆哮道，"自大的小鬼。对着全世界自慰。他们从未要求你这样做。然后你又做了什么，嗯？"

There was no answer. 没有任何回应。

"Why aren't you here?!" Asuka screamed.  
“你为什么不在这里？！”明日香尖叫道。

She kicked at a toppled chair. It skittered across the floor into the upturned table., She hugged her knees to her chest to crush out the rage. The needy billionths came creeping back at the edge of her awareness. She pressed herself back together, wiping tears from her eyes with her borrowed yellow shirt.  
她踢向一个翻倒的椅子，椅子滑过地板，撞到了翻转的桌子上。她抱紧双膝贴在胸前，试图压制住怒火。那些微不足道的亿万分之一又悄悄地回到了她的意识边缘。她努力让自己平静下来，用借来的黄色衬衫擦去眼角的泪水。

Asuka got to her feet. Rather, she remembered being on the floor and then she was already standing on the cold tile. Intent served as implication, convenience instead of chronology dictated the order of events. Adapting to this world was different the physical struggle she had expected. She wondered where she truly was and where she had to go. The cloying verisimilitude of the apartment fell apart under closer consideration. She wasn't really there.  
明日香站起身来。确切地说，她记得自己躺在地板上，然后就发现自己已经站在冰冷的瓷砖上了。意图成为暗示，便利而非时间顺序决定了事件的先后。适应这个世界与她预想的肉体挣扎不同。她想知道自己的真实所在以及必须前往的地方。在仔细审视下，公寓那令人窒息的真实感土崩瓦解。她其实并不在那里。

"If you're nowhere, that means you can go anywhere," she remarked to the domestic ruin, then marched out of the kitchen and through the apartment door.  
“如果你无处可去，那就意味着你可以去任何地方，”她对着这破败的居所自言自语，随后大步走出厨房，穿过公寓的门。

Asuka emerged into one of the anonymous corridors that criss-crossed the GeoFront. She looked behind her to see that there was no doorway, only more corridor.  
明日香走进了横贯第三新东京市地下都市的其中一条无名走廊。她回头望去，发现身后并没有门，只有更多的走廊。

"I'm dead and I still can't leave this place? Wunderbar."  
"我都死了还离不开这个地方？真棒。"

She perceived a dripping red warmth that ran down her right arm. When she looked, there didn't seem to be anything the matter. Nothing was amiss other than that the right sleeve of her plug suit was torn apart and hung in ribbons from her shoulder and wrist.  
她感觉到一股温热的红色液体顺着右臂滴落。当她查看时，似乎并没有什么异常。除了她的插入栓服右袖被撕裂，从肩膀和手腕处垂下成条状外，并无其他不妥。

"My plug suit?" Asuka ran her left hand along the slick material. It was the second time that day she had woken up in the suit without having put it on herself. The thought made her hair prickle, and it pushed against the fabric.  
"我的插入栓服？" 明日香用左手沿着滑腻的材料摸索。这是那天她第二次醒来时发现自己穿着这身衣服，而并非自己穿上的。这个念头让她头皮发麻，头发也顶着布料。

"I am dead, right?" she asked the corridor. Nobody replied. She continued walking.  
"我死了，对吧？" 她对着走廊问道。无人回应。她继续前行。

She replayed the last few seconds of her life as she understood them. The monsters descended on her. Tearing. Then they leapt into the air to prepare the killing blow. Her lips formed the words. _I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you._ A second presence in the entry plug crawled towards her. The presence was intensely familiar even through the bloody murk of LCL. And at his touch, her miserable physical existence ended with a _pop_. Asuka felt her lips.  
她回放着自以为是的生命最后几秒。怪物们向她袭来，撕扯着。随后它们跃入空中，准备致命一击。她的嘴唇形成话语：我要杀了你，我要杀了你，我要杀了你。一个第二存在在插入栓内向她爬来。即使透过 LCL 的血腥混沌，这存在也异常熟悉。在他的触碰下，她悲惨的肉体存在以一声轻响终结。明日香感觉到了自己的嘴唇。

"Did he regret it? Did he think I wouldn't find out?!"  
"他后悔了吗？他以为我不会发现吗？！"

She and Shinji had ricocheted in and out of each other's minds saying nothing particularly new but learning a great deal about one another. Memories struck her like tidal waves. He had brought them both back to the moment where she had thrown down the gauntlet. Where, with a kiss, she had for the second and final time of her life confessed her need to be loved to somebody who would not reciprocate. He balked as he had before. Strangling her, though, was different.  
她和真嗣在彼此的思绪中来回穿梭，虽然没有说出什么特别新鲜的话，但却对彼此有了更深的了解。记忆如潮水般涌向她。他带他们回到了她扔下挑战的那一刻。在那里，她用一个吻，第二次也是最后一次向一个不会回应的人坦白了她被爱的需要。他像之前一样退缩了。然而，这次他掐住她的脖子，这是不同的。

"You won't even hold me," Asuka said.  
“你甚至不愿意抱我，”明日香说。

She was in Instrumentality, a word she learned from Misato's recollections moments or millennia before. It wasn't long before the titanic cacophony of several billion more souls poured into her—their—collective consciousness. The latter arrivals weren't remotely aware of what was going on. Their great upheaval drowned out Asuka's former guardian.  
她处于人类补完状态，这个词是她从美里之前的回忆中得知的，那些回忆或许只是片刻，或许是千年之前。不久，数十亿灵魂的巨大喧嚣涌入了她——他们——的集体意识。后来者对此几乎一无所知。他们的巨大动荡淹没了明日香曾经的守护者。

The sterile white hallway stretched onward into a fluorescent infinity. There was no geometry to her environment which left Asuka increasingly disoriented and nauseous. She braced herself by a window that opened onto the vast subterranean habitat. The silvery arc of the GeoFront's false sky shone brightly. There was no blue of natural sky there. No bombs had fallen here.  
那条无菌的白色走廊无尽延伸，仿佛通向荧光的无限。周围的环境毫无几何规律，让明日香越来越感到迷失和恶心。她靠在一扇窗户上，窗外是广阔的地下居住区。GeoFront 人造天空的银色弧光闪耀着。那里没有自然天空的蔚蓝。没有炸弹曾落在这里。

"It's not real." “这不是真的。”

Asuka looked down at the bucolic forest canopy. The trees should have been blown over and burnt into charcoal. In the distance, she could distinctly make out a small garden. She squinted at it, hoping to see a figure tending to the patch. The plots were overgrown, the gardener was gone. She continued walking.  
明日香低头看着那片田园诗般的森林树冠。那些树木本应被吹倒，烧成木炭。远处，她清晰地看到一个小花园。她眯起眼睛，希望能看到有人在照料那片土地。花坛已经杂草丛生，园丁已不见踪影。她继续前行。

Her plug suit began to bunch and peel back in awkward places. It was designed to form a hermetic seal around her body, but the battle damage made that impossible. Asuka felt self-conscious despite the emptiness that stretched ahead. She could feel it beginning to slough off.  
她的插入栓服开始在尴尬的部位起皱并剥落。这件衣服原本设计为紧贴身体形成密封，但战斗造成的损伤使得这变得不可能。尽管前方是一片空旷，明日香仍感到有些难为情。她能感觉到衣服开始脱落。

"Just what I need, four billion perverts staring at me naked."  
“真是我需要的，四亿个变态盯着我裸体看。”

Asuka looked to the side to find she was miraculously if implausibly at the door to the locker room assigned to her and Rei. She stomped inside.  
明日香向旁边一看，发现自己竟然不可思议地站在了她和绫波的更衣室门前。她气冲冲地走了进去。

The locker room was also empty, which wasn't all that unusual. There had only ever been two female pilots, and one of them spent most of her time in the hospital recovery ward across the GeoFront campus. Asuka shuddered at the thought of her. She opened her locker to find her school uniform in its usual place, neatly folded and hung up, like she had just put it away before going off to battle.  
更衣室也是空的，这并不太奇怪。一直以来只有两名女性飞行员，其中一位大部分时间都在 GeoFront 校园对面的医院康复病房。想到她，明日香不禁打了个寒颤。她打开自己的储物柜，发现校服还在老地方，整齐地叠放着，就像她刚放进去就去战斗了一样。

"They made me wear that. They made me look like her."  
他们让我穿那个。他们让我看起来像她。

The locker was, aside from her shoes and watch, otherwise empty. Asuka disengaged her plug suit's form fitting mechanism, but the seals were so wrecked that she ended up needing to tear herself free strip by strip. She slumped onto the changing bench and tore away. Peeling off each piece reminded her of the awful, awkward fitting sessions back at Nerv's Third Branch in Germany but in reverse.  
除了鞋子和手表，储物柜里别无他物。明日香解除了插入栓服的贴合机制，但密封已经破损到她不得不一片片撕扯下来才能脱身。她瘫坐在换衣凳上，一片片撕下。每剥离一片都让她回想起在德国 Nerv 第三分部的那些糟糕又尴尬的试穿过程，只不过这次是反过来的。

"Sorry to ruin all your fine work, Herren," she mumbled. "You really outdid yourselves tailoring this thing. Anybody who worked in your department should've had their computers seized and scanned."  
"抱歉毁了你们所有人的辛勤工作，赫伦先生们，"她低声嘟囔道，"你们在制作这东西上确实超常发挥了。任何在你们部门工作的人，他们的电脑都应该被没收并进行扫描。

Bits of her pride came off with every piece. Her right sleeve fell to the floor in a haphazard coil with no effort at all. She had held up her hand to the monsters out of defiance. They had stripped her of that, too. She had won then lost her greatest battle. The last battle ever fought on Earth. In her fourteen years of life, Asuka could count two days when she wanted to live the most. The first day ended with her mother's death, the second ended with her own.  
每一片碎片都带走了她的一份骄傲。她的右袖毫无抵抗地掉落在地，形成了一个凌乱的螺旋。她曾举手向那些怪物表示反抗，他们也剥夺了这一点。她曾赢得后又失去了她最伟大的战斗，这是地球上最后一场战斗。在她十四年的人生中，明日香能数出两个她最想活下去的日子。第一个以她母亲的去世告终，第二个以她自己的终结告终。

Asuka stood up and shook off the rest of the suit. The last scraps to hold on were the gauntlets with their shackle-like cuffs. She let them fall to the floor with a dull clunk, then reached up to her hair. Her red headsets came out with some knots of matted red hair. She held one in each palm, hefting them. They were somewhat heavy to wear as improvised hair clips, but she had long decided that she could bear the minor discomfort in order to wear such a obvious symbol of her own greatness and authority. Everywhere she went in Tokyo-3, others knew the weight of responsibility she bore for their sake and often thanked her. Her headsets were like a crown, though unlike royalty she had earned the right to wear them.  
明日香站起身，抖落剩余的装甲。最后还紧抓不放的是带有镣铐般护腕的金属手套。她任由它们咚的一声落在地板上，随后伸手梳理头发。红色的头戴式装置连带着几缕纠结的红发被取下。她双手各握一个，掂量着。作为临时发夹，它们略显沉重，但她早已决定，为了佩戴这样一个显眼的自我伟大与权威的象征，她可以忍受这点小小的不适。无论她走到东京-3 的哪个角落，人们都知道她为他们的利益所承担的责任之重，并常常向她表示感谢。她的头戴式装置犹如一顶王冠，尽管与皇室不同，她凭借自己的权利赢得了佩戴它们的资格。

"My inheritance, from Mama. Was I born into this? Did Mama choose for me, by entering the Eva?"  
这是我从妈妈那里继承的。我是为此而生吗？妈妈是通过驾驶 Eva 为我做出选择的吗？

The headsets felt like two leaden lumps in her fists.  
头戴式装置在她手中感觉像两块沉甸甸的铅块。

Asuka turned back to her locker. Ordinarily she would have placed the headsets on the shelf inside so she'd be ready to accessorize with them again after showering. Her eyes drifted down to the pile of rags by her feet. With two flicks, she sent the headsets flying deep into the darkness of the far locker room and into oblivion. Then she dug her heel into the ruined red heap on the floor and twisted it in, her teeth bared. She shambled into the shower.  
明日香转身面向她的储物柜。通常她会把耳机放在里面的架子上，以便洗完澡后再次搭配使用。她的目光飘向脚边的一堆破布。轻轻两下，她将耳机甩进了远处的更衣室深处的黑暗中，消失不见。然后她用脚跟踩进地板上那堆破烂的红色堆里，用力扭动，咬紧牙关。她拖着沉重的步伐走进了淋浴间。

The water gave her no comfort. She couldn't help but trace her fingers along the tell-tale signs of her mental breakdown. The tone of a youthful athlete had given way to protruding ribs and hip bones. Her muscles felt tight but without strength, like a rope pulled too taut. Everywhere she pressed felt hollowed out of flesh. She wanted to punch the tile, but she doubted she even had the strength to hurt herself anymore.  
水流并没有给她带来安慰。她忍不住用手指抚摸着精神崩溃的明显痕迹。年轻运动员的体态已让位于突出的肋骨和髋骨。她的肌肉感觉紧绷却无力，就像一根拉得过紧的绳子。她按压的每一处都感觉被掏空了肉体。她想砸向瓷砖，但她怀疑自己甚至没有力气再伤害自己了。

Showered and dried off, Asuka put on her school uniform. The silence of the locker room was hemmed in on all sides by the buzz of unintelligible voices. They came from the ceiling and the floor, too.  
洗完澡并擦干后，明日香穿上了校服。更衣室的寂静被四面八方传来的难以理解的嗡嗡声所包围。这些声音来自天花板和地板，无处不在。

"What's the point in wearing this when there's no school left to attend?" Asuka babbled to fill her head with her own voice. "I guess I might as well. I guess I have no choice. What would Hikari say if I walked in without one? She let her moronic boyfriend off on dress code infractions every day. Who wears a tracksuit? Tacky." She pulled on the straps of the pinafore and pulled the red ribbon around her neck. "What would my classmates have said at Universität?" she said as she tied the bow.  
"学校都没了，还穿这玩意儿干嘛？" 明日香自言自语，试图用声音填满思绪。"算了，还是穿上吧。没得选。要是我就这么进去，光会怎么说？她天天放任她那傻瓜男友违反着装规定。谁会穿运动服啊？真俗。" 她拉了拉围裙的带子，绕上脖子上的红丝带。"要是在大学里，同学们会怎么说呢？" 她边说边系上蝴蝶结。

Asuka felt a change in the atmosphere, a displacement of the hot humidity by somebody cold, clammy.  
明日香感觉到气氛变了，闷热的湿气被某种冰冷、黏腻的东西取代了。

"You're here," she said. "你来了，" 她说。

She turned around. Rei Ayanami stood facing Asuka in front of her own locker wearing her own school uniform. Asuka looked her up and down.  
她转过身来。绫波丽站在自己的储物柜前，面对着明日香，穿着自己的校服。明日香上下打量着她。

"I hate that I have to look like you in any way."  
我讨厌在任何方面看起来都像你。

Asuka balled her fists. She curled her toes into the remains of her plug suit underfoot. Rei's eerie red eyes returned Asuka's glare more attentively than they ever had in life. No longer dully impassive, Rei held her in a gaze suffused with curiosity. Asuka folded her arms across her chest and frowned. The portentous ache in the pit of her stomach she credited to anger, not fear.  
明日香握紧了拳头。她蜷曲脚趾，踩在脚下破损的插入栓服上。绫波那双诡异的红色眼睛比生前任何时候都更加专注地回瞪着明日香。不再是无动于衷的漠然，绫波用充满好奇的目光凝视着她。明日香双臂交叉在胸前，皱起了眉头。她将腹中那不祥的痛楚归咎于愤怒，而非恐惧。

"Well? Where's he gone off to? Isn't he your son or something?"  
"那么？他跑哪儿去了？他不是你儿子之类的吗？"

"I am not his mother," Rei replied. Her voice, though as monotone as Asuka remembered, contained hints of emphasis she hadn't detected before. An edge.  
"我不是他母亲，"绫波丽回答道。她的声音，尽管和明日香记忆中一样单调，但这次却带有些许她之前未曾察觉的强调。一种锋芒。

"So where is he?" she said with a haughty jerk of her head. "I wasn't through with him."  
"那他到底在哪儿？"她傲慢地一甩头说道，"我还没跟他完事呢。"

Rei looked upwards. 绫波抬头望去。

"Did he think he was through with me?" Asuka continued. "Will you ignore me, too?"  
“他以为就这样甩掉我了吗？”明日香继续说道，“你也会无视我吗？”

"He is gone." “他已经走了。”

"I know he's gone! Where?! Where can anybody go from here?"  
"我知道他走了！去哪了？！从这里还能去哪儿？"

"He has gone back into the world. He wanted to experience the boundaries between people again. He hopes to come to a new understanding between himself and others."  
"他已经回到了这个世界。他想再次体验人与人之间的界限。他希望能与他人之间达成新的理解。"

"Hah! So he ran away?" said Asuka. The idea of going back, though, sent her reeling. Whatever survived out there which waited for her couldn't be good.  
"哈！所以他逃跑了？" 阿苏卡说道。然而，回去的想法让她感到眩晕。外面等待她的，无论是什么，都不会是好事。

Rei didn't respond. 绫波没有回应。

"Of course he ran away. He does all of this, whatever this is, and he runs away. He finally, finally almost got what he wanted," Asuka raved on, unfolding her arms so she could caress her throat meaningfully, "and he still runs away! Invincible coward!" Asuka kicked her locker door shut.  
“他当然逃跑了。他做了这一切，不管这是什么，他都逃跑了。他终于，终于几乎得到了他想要的，”明日香继续说道，展开双臂，意味深长地抚摸着自己的喉咙，“他还是逃跑了！无敌的懦夫！”明日香一脚踢上了储物柜的门。

"You gave him permission."  
“你给了他许可。”

"What could that possibly mean?"  
"这到底是什么意思？"

Rei didn't elaborate. Asuka understood what Rei had meant, and she knew Rei did, too. Asuka hadn't raised a hand to stop Shinji. She had goaded him into the act.  
绫波没有详细说明。明日香明白绫波的意思，她也知道绫波明白。明日香并没有出手阻止真嗣。她其实是怂恿他这么做的。

"Fine, he's gone. Gut. Can I go now?"  
"好吧，他走了。真爽。我现在可以走了吗？"

Rei glanced back upwards.  
绫波再次向上望去。

"Yes, but if you go you will die."  
“是的，但如果你去，你会死。”

Asuka tasted LCL in her mouth again, or maybe it was simply her own blood.  
明日香再次尝到了嘴里的 LCL，或者可能只是她自己的血。

"Is that a threat?" "那是一种威胁吗？"

"It is reality. Your injuries have left you weak and vulnerable. You would not be able to provide yourself with even basic needs."  
"这是现实。你的伤势让你变得虚弱和脆弱。你甚至无法满足自己最基本的需求。"

Asuka looked down at her body, feeling certain places where she remembered the pain. Her flesh felt whole to her in this place, but she knew better. She remembered their tearing mouths, their spears. When she closed her eyes, she could feel it again. She pushed all of that down for now. Asuka knew she had plenty of time for those new nightmares to join the old ones.  
明日香低头看着自己的身体，感觉到某些地方她记得曾有疼痛。在这个地方，她的肉体感觉完好无损，但她心里清楚。她记得那些撕咬的嘴，那些长矛。当她闭上眼睛，她能再次感受到那种痛苦。她现在把这一切都压了下去。明日香知道，她有足够的时间让这些新的噩梦与旧的噩梦一同降临。"

She lunged at Rei. "He leaves me to die but I don't die! He tries to kill me but doesn't finish the job!" Asuka grasped Rei by the shoulders and shook. "Are you here to do it? What?! No!"  
她猛地扑向绫波。“他让我去死，但我没死！他想杀我，却没完成任务！”明日香抓住绫波的肩膀摇晃着。“你是来完成它的吗？什么？！不！”

Asuka's hands passed through Rei's clothing as though she was shrouded in smoke. They sank into the flesh of Rei's shoulders. Their skin rippled and smoothed out into a single surface. She saw an orange tank full of blissful Rei doppelgangers. Crushed eyeglasses. A severed hand. The Earth from orbit but her feet still touched the ground. Her and Shinji passing into and through each other. The intimacy of it all was unlike anything Asuka had ever known.  
明日香的手穿过了绫波的衣服，仿佛她被烟雾笼罩。它们沉入绫波肩膀的肉体中。两人的皮肤泛起涟漪，又平滑成一个整体。她看到一个装满快乐绫波复制体的橙色罐子。破碎的眼镜。一只断手。从轨道上看地球，但她的脚仍触地。她和真嗣相互穿透，彼此交融。这种亲密无间的感觉是明日香从未体验过的。

Asuka ripped her hands free. They came out clean and with a snap. She took a step away from Rei, but tripped over her tattered plug suit and fell into the lockers.  
明日香猛地抽回双手，干净利落地一响。她后退一步，却被破烂的插入栓服绊倒，摔进了储物柜里。

"You cannot die here. The boundaries between our hearts were broken by Third Impact. A human organism was once composed of many complementary cells surmounted by a single mind. This new organism is made up of many minds which complement each other to form a single existence, a perfect understanding. Your emotions are the cells. As our bodies did not forget to regrow the cells we shed in life to maintain its wholeness, so this new organism will not forget that which makes it whole."  
"你不能死在这里。第三次冲击打破了我们心灵的界限。人类有机体曾经由许多互补的细胞组成，其上有一个单一的意识。这个新有机体由许多相互补充的意识组成，形成一个单一的存在，一个完美的理解。你的情感就是细胞。正如我们的身体不会忘记在生命中再生我们脱落的细胞以维持其完整性一样，这个新有机体也不会忘记使其完整的那些东西。"

Rei paused to consider. 绫波停顿了一下，思考着。

"However, I believe that you will only know pain here."  
"然而，我相信你在这里只会感受到痛苦。"

"My choices are pain or death?! So this is Hell?"  
"我的选择是痛苦还是死亡？！这就是地狱吗？"

"This is neither a heaven nor hell. It is everlasting life in its most elementary form. A new organism we—"  
"这里既非天堂也非地狱。这是最基本形式的不朽生命。一个新生物，我们——"

"Who cares about any of that? What are you?"  
"谁在乎那些？你是什么？"

"I do not know. But..."  
"我不知道。但是..."

Rei closed her eyes. Her lips curled up into the slightest of smiles.  
零闭上了眼睛。她的嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝微笑。

"When did you learn that trick?"  
"你什么时候学会那招的？"

"Before we met," Rei said before continuing. "But I know that here I am at home in the heart of this new world. Here I can experience humanity for the first time. I did not know how to interpret your words or your faces before. A word could have two opposite meanings, or ten meanings each similar but exclusive of one another. A face could have a thousand from moment to moment."  
"在我们相遇之前，" 绫波继续说道，"但我知道在这里，我在这个新世界的心脏中找到了家的感觉。在这里，我第一次体验到了人性。以前我不懂得如何解读你们的言语和表情。一个词可能有两种截然相反的意义，或者有十种相似但又互斥的意义。一个表情可以在瞬间变化万千。"

She opened her eyes, now full of inquiry. Asuka felt somebody else recalling her memories. That somebody recalled an elevator ride.  
她睁开眼睛，充满了探究。明日香感觉到有人在回忆她的记忆。那个人回忆了一次电梯之旅。

"You opened your heart to the Eva," Rei said finally.  
"你向 Eva 敞开了心扉，" 绫波最终说道。

Asuka swallowed a mouthful of clotted metallic vileness. She shook her head violently.  
明日香咽下了一口凝结的金属恶臭。她猛烈地摇了摇头。

"Stay out! Freak!" “滚开！怪物！”

"There can be no secrets here," Rei said. She stepped towards Asuka, who flinched but didn't withdraw. "I would like to understand. Please?" She reached out her hand.  
“这里不可能有秘密，”绫波说道。她向明日香走去，后者虽然畏缩但没有后退。“我想理解。请告诉我？”她伸出了手。

Asuka twitched her arm to slap Rei's away, but the plaintive simplicity of the request stayed her. She relaxed to indicate something like acquiescence. She was getting tired and giving in was getting easier. Rei placed the palm of her hand on Asuka's arm, muddling the border between them once again. She closed her eyes. Her lips stayed frozen in their typical near-frown. Asuka sensed memories of her early childhood. Of her mother and dolls and pride and loss. It wasn't like when the Angel had ripped through her mind. The sensation was reminiscent of hearing a movie playing in the theater next to her own.  
明日香本想挥动手臂拍开绫波的手，但那恳求中的单纯让她停了下来。她放松身体，表示出一种类似默许的态度。她感到疲惫，屈服也变得容易起来。绫波将手掌放在明日香的手臂上，再次模糊了彼此的界限。她闭上眼睛，嘴唇依旧保持着她惯有的近乎皱眉的表情。明日香感受到了她早年的童年记忆，关于她的母亲、玩偶、骄傲与失落。这与使徒撕裂她心灵的感觉不同，这种感觉就像是在自己的影院旁边，听到了另一家影院正在播放的电影。

In Asuka's theater, she saw scenes from the triple lives of Rei Ayanami. In the beginning there were so many cold hands. Four hands, two and two, had belonged to an Akagi. The hands got warmer. Four hands, two and two, had belonged to an Ikari. Gendo's had made her feel useful, but Shinji's made her feel recognized. From his hands, the heat had reached her face to turn it pink, an effect Rei considered miraculous in the moment.  
在明日香的影院里，她看到了绫波丽三重生活的场景。起初，有许多冰冷的手。四只手，两两成对，属于一个赤木。那些手逐渐变得温暖。四只手，两两成对，属于一个碇。源堂的手让她感到有用，而真嗣的手让她感到被认可。从他的手中，热量传到她的脸上，使它泛起粉红，那一刻绫波觉得这简直是奇迹。

Asuka saw that nobody new to Rei's life had chosen to be there in the sense that they were there for her company. Rei's life was their science fair project. They had degrees in engineering, medicine, or metaphysical biology. They had signed all the NERV confidentiality agreements and releases. Up until Shinji, Rei had never considered whether or not she herself could choose who to let in. She had nothing else but piloting the Eva.  
明日香注意到，在绫波的生活中，那些新来的人并没有选择以陪伴她的方式存在。绫波的生活对他们而言，更像是一个科学展览项目。他们拥有工程学、医学或形而上学生物学的学位。他们签署了 NERV 的所有保密协议和免责声明。直到真嗣出现，绫波才从未考虑过自己是否可以选择让谁进入她的生活。除了驾驶 Eva，她一无所有。

Then Shinji had torn open her entry plug and begged her not to say goodbye or to say that she had nothing else. Rei realized she had been wrong. She could choose to have something beyond her given purpose. She chose to smile.  
然后真嗣撕开了她的插入栓，恳求她不要说再见，也不要说她一无所有。绫波意识到自己错了。她可以选择拥有超越既定目的的东西。她选择了微笑。

Asuka gritted her teeth at the scene played out before her.  
明日香咬紧牙关，眼前的场景让她难以忍受。

"All that for you," she said.  
"这一切都是为了你，"她说道。

Asuka opened her eyes—she didn't remember closing them—to find that they remained in their locker room, now clear of steam. Rei's lips parted and she inhaled a short, sharp breath. She withdrew her hand.  
明日香睁开眼睛——她不记得自己何时闭上了它们——发现他们仍然在更衣室里，现在蒸汽已经消散。绫波的嘴唇微微张开，她深吸了一口短促而尖锐的气息。她收回了手。

"Thank you, I understand better now," she said. Her eyes filled with sorrow.  
"谢谢你，我现在更明白了，"她说道。她的眼中充满了悲伤。

Asuka rolled her eyes to break contact. "So you think you understand me, too?"  
明日香翻了个白眼，移开视线。“所以你也觉得自己很了解我？”

"We are alike and complementary. That was why we piloted Eva. We had nothing else. That is why we opened our hearts. We had no one else."  
我们相似又互补，这就是我们驾驶 EVA 的原因。我们一无所有，这就是我们敞开心扉的原因。我们没有别人。

"Don't compare yourself to me."  
别拿你自己和我比。

"What makes us different is in how we experience loss. I have not felt the loss of somebody I needed. The people I have lost I chose to lose, or no longer needed. Those choices were necessary. How do you experience loss? Loss dominates your life for a life spent so alone."  
"我们之间的不同在于我们如何经历失去。我未曾感受过失去我需要的人。我所失去的人，是我选择失去的，或是我不再需要的。这些选择是必要的。你是如何经历失去的？失去主宰了你孤独一生的生活。"

"Do you want a medal for bravery?"  
"你想要一枚勇敢奖章吗？"

Rei thought. 绫思考着。

"I do not want for anything here, nor need. What do you want?"  
"我在这里无所求，亦无所缺。你想要什么？"

"Nothing!" "什么也没做！"

"Who do you need?" "你需要谁？"

"Nobody!" "谁也不需要！"

"Then why do you want to leave here, the only place where he will never be?"  
"那么你为何还想离开这里，这个他永远不会出现的地方？"

Asuka stood up. 明日香站了起来。

"This is stupid. I'm tired of it. I have nothing left to say. You already know what I'm going to say before I say it! What else would I say to you, anyway? 'Good job blowing yourself up'? Well you didn't save him or the world so what good was it? We both lost, is that what you want to hear? That I'm no better than you? That we're the same kind of failure? I'm done! I'm leaving!"  
"这太愚蠢了。我厌倦了。我无话可说。你甚至在我开口之前就知道我要说什么了！我还能对你说什么呢？'干得好，把自己炸了'？但你既没救他也没拯救世界，那又有什么意义？我们都输了，你想听的是这个吗？说我并不比你强？说我们都是同样的失败者？我受够了！我要走了！"

Rei stepped aside to clear Asuka's path to the exit.  
绫波侧身让路，为明日香清出通往出口的路径。

"He allowed for that choice."  
“他允许了那个选择。”

"He allowed it?!" Asuka wailed. "He'll never choose what I can and can't do!"  
“他允许了？！”明日香哀嚎道，“他永远别想决定我能做什么，不能做什么！”

Asuka leaned back against a wall that hadn't been there a moment before. They were in an elevator. The floor indicator ticked down. Rei faced the elevator door. Asuka kicked her foot into the wall.  
明日香向后靠去，倚在一堵刚才还不存在的墙上。他们身处电梯之中。楼层指示器缓缓下降。绫波丽面对着电梯门。明日香一脚踢向墙壁。

"Here?! Here we go again! 'Open your heart'? I did. It's still there in my plug buried in that ruin above us, or below us, or wherever we are! Scoop it out and look inside!"  
“在这里？！又来这一套！‘敞开心扉’？我试过了。它还在我的插入栓里，埋在那废墟之上，或是之下，管我们到底在哪儿！挖出来看看里面吧！”

Asuka began to sob. Her own words called out to her: "If I can't have all of you, I don't want any of you!"  
明日香开始啜泣。她自己的话语在耳边回响：“如果不能拥有全部的你，我宁愿不要任何一部分！”

"I told him! You were there! I told him exactly what it would take! What did he do? He ends the world to get away from me! I hate him! I hate him!"  
"我告诉过他！你当时在场！我明确告诉他需要付出什么代价！他做了什么？他毁灭世界只为逃离我！我恨他！我恨他！"

"If you go back, you will die."  
"如果你回去，你会死。"

"Maybe I want to! I didn't fight him! I let him! I let him!"  
"也许我愿意！我没有反抗他！我任由他！我任由他！"

"You don't want to die," Rei said, peering over her shoulder for a  
"你不想死，"绫波说，她回头瞥了一眼，

moment. Asuka thought her red eyes conveyed just the slightest hint of smug self-satisfaction, or maybe her rage had now blinded her. "You said so several times. You remember, as well can I."  
片刻后。明日香觉得她的红眼睛透露出那么一丝自鸣得意的满足，或者也许是她的愤怒已经让她盲目。"你说过好几次了。你记得，我也一样。"

Asuka for the first time felt fear in this place.  
明日香第一次在这个地方感到了恐惧。

"When my previous self chose to die it was not a difficult decision for her to make," Rei continued. "Her choice then was clear: die and lose herself or lose those whom she loved. I have come to believe that is an aspect of what it means to love: Choosing to sacrifice oneself for the sake of others. When my previous self died, her love died, though. She did not love herself. I have learned from her example in that way as well."  
"当我的前身选择死亡时，对她来说这并不是一个艰难的决定，" 绫波继续说道。"她当时的选择很明确：死去并失去自我，或是失去她所爱的人。我逐渐相信，这就是爱的意义之一：为了他人的利益而选择牺牲自己。当我的前身死去时，她的爱也随之消逝。她并不爱自己。在这方面，我也从她的例子中学到了很多。

"Stop talking!" "别说了！

The floor indicator ticked lower. Rei tilted her head upwards.  
楼层指示器缓缓下降。绫波微微抬头向上望去。

"You bring yourself deeper."  
"你让自己陷得更深了。"

"Please just shut up." "请你就此闭嘴吧。"

"Do you think it is possible to sacrifice part of oneself for the whole of oneself?"  
"你认为有可能为了整体的自己而牺牲一部分自己吗？"

"Stop." "停下。"

"Do you think it is possible to love beyond destruction?"  
"你认为在毁灭之后还能有爱吗？"

"Just stop!" "快停下！"

Rei turned fully around to look at Asuka.  
绫波转过身来，正视着明日香。

"Do you think need precedes love?"  
你认为需要先于爱吗？

Asuka shoved past Rei and punched the elevator's Emergency Stop button. The doors swung open and she stepped out into the sun, sea air, and the thick scent of a man's cologne.  
明日香推开绫波，猛地按下电梯的紧急停止按钮。电梯门随即打开，她踏出电梯，迎面而来的是阳光、海风，以及浓烈的男士古龙水味。

### Burial at Sea
Asuka couldn't feel the pleasant sea breeze blowing over her through all the layers of clothing she had wrapped herself in before coming on deck. She had originally picked out a simple yellow sun dress for her Japanese debut, but it left her feeling exposed this time around. Instead, she wore a long and loose-fitting dress with a faint floral print. Over that she wore a heavy cardigan and over that a bomber jacket she had snatched from a naval aviator's locker.  
明日香感受不到吹拂过她的宜人的海风，因为她来甲板前把自己裹了好几层衣服。她原本为她的日本首秀挑选了一件简单的黄色太阳裙，但这次却让她感到暴露。于是，她换上了一件带有淡淡花卉图案的长款宽松连衣裙。外面套了一件厚重的开襟毛衣，再外面是一件从海军飞行员储物柜里抓来的飞行员夹克。

She hadn't packed anything longer than shorts. They had told her how the climate of Japan was particularly warm since Second Impact even in winter. Instead she wore thick, dark stockings she brought for the occasional chilly days. Asuka supposed she could buy pants with her stipend once they arrived. A pair of aviator sunglasses, also borrowed from the crew, shielded her two weary blue eyes from the sun's glare.  
她没有带比短裤更长的衣物。他们告诉她，第二次冲击后，日本的气候即使在冬天也特别温暖。因此，她穿上了为偶尔的寒冷日子准备的厚实深色长筒袜。明日香想，一旦到达，她可以用津贴买条裤子。一副从船员那里借来的飞行员太阳镜，遮住了她那双疲惫的蓝色眼睛，挡住了阳光的刺眼。

The flight deck below crawled with activity. Out at sea, she tracked a boxy UN VTOL transport craft approaching from the direction of the mainland. She knew it was carrying her welcome party of Misato, Shinji, and his friends. Soon they would meet for the first time—again—right before the fish Angel would strike. Her mind played out a few combat scenarios based on her prior experience. She had been in training since she was four years old so it was too easy a habit to slip back into when thinking itself became burdensome.  
下方的飞行甲板一片繁忙。在海上，她追踪到一架方正的联合国垂直起降运输机正从大陆方向接近。她知道那上面载着她的欢迎队伍——美里、真嗣和他的朋友们。很快，他们将首次——再次——见面，就在鱼天使袭击之前。她的脑海中根据以往经验演练了几种战斗场景。自从四岁起就开始训练，当思考本身变得繁重时，重新进入这种习惯太容易了。

Asuka let her head droop so she could watch the sea far below her perch on the superstructure of the aircraft carrier. The grey hull of the antique battlewagon effortlessly sliced through the water much like she could herself as she was a trained diver. She was a strong swimmer, maybe too strong. She wondered, should she fall, if she would count as flotsam or jetsam. She wondered if the difference would matter to whatever maritime authority adjudicated her death, should she fall.  
明日香让头垂下，以便从航空母舰的超级结构上俯瞰远处的海面。这艘古董战舰的灰色船体轻松地切割着水流，就像她自己作为一名训练有素的潜水员能做到的那样。她是个强壮的游泳者，也许太强壮了。她思索着，如果她坠落，她会被算作漂浮物还是被抛弃的物品。她想知道，对于任何裁定她死亡的海事当局来说，这种区别是否重要。

She mouthed some words from her mother's lullaby: _Und sperrt man mich ein im finsteren Kerker..._  
"她轻声念出母亲摇篮曲中的几句歌词：“Und sperrt man mich ein im finsteren Kerker...”

Asuka clutched at her stomach and squeezed, nearly caving herself in all on her own. The vast and empty hollowness within her had formed after the first few nights. A void she had wished to fill yawned wider than she had thought possible. A vacuum that pulled her flesh taut from within. The weight of the air itself felt oppressive.  
明日香紧抓着自己的腹部，用力挤压，几乎要将自己完全压垮。最初的几个夜晚过后，她体内形成了一个巨大而空洞的虚无。她曾希望填补的空洞，如今张得比她想象的还要宽广。一个从内部将她的肌肤拉紧的真空。连空气本身的重量都显得压抑。

Not as oppressive, though, as the hands that now rested on her shoulders and squeezed them lightly. His hands. She could not say that name or even think it any longer. Not since. She sensed that he had noted that change, but it seemed to frighten him more than hurt him. She found herself wishing the latter was the case. At least it would mean he could be still be moved by anything she felt for him.  
然而，这种压抑感，与现在轻放在她肩上并轻轻捏住的手相比，就不算什么了。那是他的手。她已经无法说出那个名字，甚至无法再想起来。自从那件事之后。她感觉到他已经注意到了这个变化，但这似乎更多地让他感到恐惧而非伤害。她发现自己宁愿后者是真的，至少这意味着他还能被她对他的任何感情所触动。

_You're disgusting, Asuka. You're pathetic.  
你真恶心，明日香。你真可悲。_

"Asuka-chan," he said, as breezy as the wind, though with an edge that had never been there before. It made him sound like a villain in a child's cartoon. "We have to keep what you did..." he squeezed, "that night and everything else our secret. I don't think it has to be said. Nevertheless, I'm saying it. There will also be a lot more..." he squeezed again, "supervision at the GeoFront. We'll have to see less of each other, but I'll see what arrangements can be made. It will be hard on me, too."  
"明日香酱，"他轻风般地说道，但语气中带着一丝前所未有的锋芒，听起来就像儿童卡通里的反派。"我们必须保守你那晚所做的一切……以及其他的秘密。我想这不必多说。尽管如此，我还是得说。此外，在 GeoFront 将会有更多的……"他再次加重语气，"监督。我们见面的机会会减少，但我会看看能做些什么安排。这对我也很难受。

It had been a long voyage from Germany to Japan. Asuka measured it in nights. She had designed her new reality to begin the first night out of Wilhelmshaven and put into action the very same plot that she had schemed about for weeks the first time around. It was not hard to contrive a similar situation on that first night since she already possessed the audacity to make her move. Wherever the two of them went aboard ship, they soon found themselves left alone. The UN naval personnel, wary of anybody involved with those robotic monsters that slept in baths of blood, gave the two a wide berth. Now, afterwards, the crew still did, but not because of the Evangelion.  
从德国到日本的航程漫长。明日香以夜晚来衡量这段旅程。她设计了自己的新现实，从离开威廉港的第一晚开始，并实施了与之前几周策划的完全相同的计划。由于她早已具备采取行动的勇气，在第一晚制造类似情境并不困难。无论两人在船上何处，很快就会发现自己被孤立。联合国海军人员对与那些浸泡在血浴中的机器人怪物有关的人保持警惕，给两人留下了宽阔的空间。如今，事后看来，船员们依然如此，但不是因为 EVA。

She had thought she would pull off her plan because, like a god, she had created this fantasy to live out her infinite days. Before Japan, before the crowded little apartment, before the Angel had bored through her mind, before the bathtub and the hospital. Before the boy. She arrived at the perfect moment before her life had been completely derailed. The moment when she knew for certain who she wanted by her side.  
她曾以为自己能成功实施计划，因为她如同神一般，创造了这个幻想，以度过她无尽的日子。在日本之前，在那间拥挤的小公寓之前，在天使穿透她心灵之前，在浴缸和医院之前。在那个男孩之前。她到达了那个完美的时刻，那时她的生活还未完全脱轨。那一刻，她确信自己想要谁在身边。

"And," he continued, "they will notice how you've changed when you get you're processed. You won't be able to hide it so don't try. I think your last one was a few weeks before we left. You didn't have any since Unit-02 was packed for shipment, right?"  
而且，"他继续说道，"当你被处理后，他们会注意到你的变化。你无法隐藏，所以别尝试。我想你上一次是在我们离开前几周。自从二号机被打包装运后，你就再也没有过了，对吧？

It had been a clear and starry night on the North Sea, the first night out. Asuka had scouted out the perfect place to strike on the battleship's stern. The enormous bulk of the ship's aft turret obscured a large area from any prying eyes up in the superstructure. She had practically dragged him there by the arm, leaving deep creases in his sleeve.  
那是北海上的一个晴朗星夜，出海的第一晚。明日香已经找到了在战舰尾部发动攻击的完美地点。船尾巨大的炮塔遮挡了从上层建筑窥视的任何目光。她几乎是拽着他的胳膊把他拖到那里，袖子上留下了深深的皱褶。

Asuka's heart had pounded with anticipation and embarrassment. Remembering how she had tried before brought waves of humiliation back onto herself: _I was too eager, too childish. This time will be different._ She still complained about not getting to see him as much when they arrived, but caught herself before she blurted out Misato's name. There was no reason to remind him of the past. When he brought up the Third Child, she had quietly unfastened the top buttons of her dress from collar to chest.  
明日香的内心既充满期待又感到羞涩。回想起之前的尝试，一波波的羞辱感涌上心头：我太急切了，太幼稚了。这次会有所不同。尽管她抱怨到达后没能多见他几面，但及时止住了自己，没说出美里这个名字。没有理由让他回忆过去。当他提到第三适格者时，她默默地从领口到胸前解开了连衣裙的顶扣。

The VTOL was close enough to make out some of its larger markings, like the big UN NAVY lettering. He spoke, "Yeah, it must have been a few weeks. Just enough time. Who was that guy in your physics seminar? The one you said would stare at you? Felix?"  
那架垂直起降飞机近得足以看清一些较大的标记，比如醒目的 UN NAVY 字样。他开口道：“是啊，大概有几周了。刚好足够。你物理研讨会上那个家伙是谁来着？就是那个你说会盯着你看的人？费利克斯？”

Asuka pressed her lips into a thin line. Her college classmates had largely ignored her, the temperamental tween prodigy, after she had humiliated herself enough times trying to approach them as her peers. They had appreciated her advanced knowledge and technical expertise as a lab partner. Some of the women had even invited her to their study sessions, though there she felt more like their mascot—or their doll—than like anything resembling a colleague. An impermeable curtain was drawn between Asuka and them outside of academics. She could sense the mood shift, when to slip away when the discussion turned towards topics only for adults, like their endlessly shifting webs of romance, sex, breakups.  
明日香紧抿着嘴唇。她的大学同学们大多忽视了她，这位脾气暴躁的少年天才，在她多次试图接近他们却自取其辱之后。他们欣赏她作为实验伙伴的先进知识和专业技能。一些女生甚至邀请她参加学习小组，尽管在那里她感觉自己更像她们的吉祥物——或者她们的玩偶——而不是任何意义上的同事。在学术之外，明日香与她们之间隔着一道不可逾越的帷幕。她能感受到气氛的变化，知道何时该悄悄离开，当讨论转向只有成年人才能涉及的话题，比如她们那不断变化的恋爱、性、分手的复杂网络。

The most consistent attention she garnered was the silent sort that followed her from the classroom door to her desk and back again after class was dismissed. The quiet attentiveness of a pair of eyes. In every class there was at least one pair, often more.  
她最常得到的是那种无声的关注，从教室门口到她的座位，再到下课后再次离开。那是一双眼睛的静默注视。在每堂课上，至少有一双这样的眼睛，通常还不止一双。

Asuka had developed her first and only defensive tactic purely by accident. She was late one day after a prototype sync test ran long at Third Branch. When she entered the full classroom, she made eye contact with an admirer as she found her way to her desk. His eyes widened, his predilection found out. Like a bent reed suddenly released, he shot up in his seat and turned towards the professor. There his gaze remained fixed until class was dismissed when Asuka found herself being tracked as she left.  
明日香偶然间发展出了她的第一个也是唯一的防御策略。一天，她在第三分部进行原型同步测试后迟到了。当她走进坐满人的教室时，她在寻找自己座位的过程中与一位仰慕者对视了。他的眼睛睁大了，仿佛被发现了喜好。就像一根弯曲的芦苇突然被释放，他猛地从座位上站起来，转向教授。他的目光一直固定在那里，直到下课，而明日香发现自己离开时被人跟踪了。

_Yeah, I see you, pervert_, she recalled thinking, the whole of her soul clouding over. She had learned the principles of jiu jitsu as part of her combat training and put them to use on this battlefield. It didn't take much, just leaning forward would do. Then she'd wait one of them out. It never took long. Then, without moving, she'd swivel her eyes over and stare back. It took a moment for them to notice, but she always caught her prey.  
是的，我看到你了，变态，她回忆起自己当时的想法，整个心灵都笼罩在阴影中。她作为战斗训练的一部分学习了柔道的原则，并将其应用在这个战场上。这不需要太多，只需稍微前倾即可。然后她会等待其中一个人放弃。这从来不会花太长时间。接着，她不动声色地转动眼睛，回望过去。他们需要一会儿才能注意到，但她总能捕捉到猎物。

In those moments she knew she had made the most intimate connections she ever would with her classmates. She expanded her universe of self-hatred outwards to encompass her body, too.  
在那些时刻，她知道自己与同学们建立了最亲密的联系。她将自己的自我厌恶向外扩展，也包括了自己的身体。

A sudden gust of sea air caught Asuka in the face.  
一阵突如其来的海风迎面扑向明日香。

"I think it was Felix," he said with more certainty.  
他更加确定地说：“我想那是费利克斯。”

She earnestly had forgotten his name at this point. It might have been Felix. Rarely did they bother to make introductions. She tried to shrug but the weight of his hands dampened the gesture.  
她确实已经忘记了他的名字，可能是费利克斯吧。他们很少费心做自我介绍。她试图耸肩，但他双手的重量让这个动作显得无力。

"Well, when they notice, blow it off as nothing. It's not such a big deal. You grew up so fast, we all know that. They shouldn't be surprised given how attractive you are. If they press you, just blame that creep. You knew you were leaving, had a silly fling, didn't mean anything. No need to make a fuss or follow up."  
"嗯，当他们注意到时，就当作没什么大不了的。你成长得这么快，我们都知道。鉴于你的魅力，他们不应该感到惊讶。如果他们追问，就怪那个讨厌的家伙。你知道自己要离开，有过一段轻率的恋情，没什么大不了的。没必要小题大做或跟进。"

And on that starry first night at sea when before he had dismissed her as a child, Asuka didn't whine or beg or fling herself on top of him.  
而在那个星光灿烂的海上第一夜，之前他还把她当作孩子看待，明日香并没有抱怨、哀求或扑到他身上。

"You're still a child," he had said then, wearily. She tugged the front of her dress open just enough. She whispered in a husky voice like something out of a movie.  
"你还是个孩子，"他当时疲惫地说。她轻轻拉开了裙子的前襟，用一种电影里才有的沙哑声音低语。

"Oh? Look at me, Ryoji."  
"哦？看着我，Ryoji。"

That time he did more than look, he finally saw. He saw her as the adult—the woman—she knew she was ready to become. She rolled into him and felt his resistance fail. All the usual reluctance and propriety, of prying her loose and wagging his finger, it was all a pretense just as she had long fantasized. He stopped pushing and instead pulled her into a place she could never leave.  
那一刻，他不仅仅是看，他终于看见了。他看到了她作为成年人——她知道自己已经准备好成为的那个女人。她滚向他，感受到他的抵抗瓦解。所有平常的犹豫和礼节，试图将她拉开并摇动手指的举动，这一切都只是她长久以来幻想中的伪装。他不再推开，而是将她拉入一个她永远无法离开的地方。

After the first night, Asuka wondered where the butterflies in her stomach had gone. She wondered if they had hid themselves in a chrysalis like the one she had at last escaped. After the second night, she found it harder to meet his gaze. After the third, she could no longer say his name. A tepid smile had to do from then on. The butterflies were dead: that lovey-dovey stuff was for children, but what they were doing wasn't for adults. There were too many nights between Germany and Japan.  
第一个夜晚过后，明日香想知道她胃里的蝴蝶去了哪里。她想知道它们是否像她最终逃离的茧一样，将自己藏在了某个茧中。第二个夜晚后，她发现更难直视他的眼睛。第三个夜晚后，她再也无法说出他的名字。从那时起，一个淡淡的微笑就足够了。蝴蝶已经死去：那种甜蜜的东西只属于孩子，而他们所做的并不适合成年人。在德国和日本之间有太多的夜晚。

The VTOL now hovered over the landing zone. Deck crew hurried around preparing for the landing, shouting and waving their arms. Asuka blinked something out of her eyes and looked at the windows in the passenger compartment. She could see Misato and the otaku with his camera peering out, but not Shinji's face.  
垂直起降飞机此刻悬停在着陆区上方。甲板工作人员匆忙地准备着陆，大声呼喊并挥舞着手臂。明日香眨了眨眼，清除了眼中的异物，望向客舱的窗户。她能看到美里和那个拿着相机的宅男正向外窥视，但不见真嗣的面孔。

"Too late, again, idiot," she whispered into the jet howl.  
“又晚了，笨蛋，”她在喷气机的呼啸声中低语。

After a final curt squeeze, he released her shoulders.  
最后用力一捏后，他松开了她的肩膀。

"Why don't you go out and meet Misato and the Third Child now? You remember her, right? She and I, well, it was a long time ago and people grow apart."  
"为什么你现在不去见见葛城小姐和第三适格者呢？你还记得她吧？她和我的关系，嗯，那是好久以前的事了，人们总是会渐行渐远。

Asuka vomited over the rail.  
明日香对着栏杆呕吐起来。

Her hands gripped something metal but it was no longer a railing aboard a ship. It was the rim of a spartan steel toilet, the sort that had been installed by the thousands across NERV facilities. Asuka blinked. The water was clean of what she expected to find. Instead, a thin ribbon of pale red stood suspended in the water in the bowl.  
她的双手紧握着某种金属物体，但那已不再是船上的栏杆。那是 NERV 设施中成千上万安装的简朴钢制马桶边缘。明日香眨了眨眼。水中并没有她预料中的污物。相反，一缕淡淡的红色细丝悬浮在马桶的水中。

"Disgusting, isn't it?" said a distant voice.  
"真恶心，不是吗？"一个遥远的声音说道。

A cramp released its hold. It had been a bad one, jagged aches all the way down to her legs. Asuka felt somebody holding her hair back in a fist. She turned her head too suddenly and so yanked her own hair.  
一阵痉挛终于松开了它的束缚。这次特别严重，刺痛一直延伸到她的腿部。明日香感觉到有人在用手紧紧抓住她的头发。她猛地转头，结果扯到了自己的头发。

"Relax, it's over," murmured the person crouching over her. She released Asuka's hair.  
"放松，已经结束了，"蹲在她身边的人轻声说道。她松开了明日香的头发。

"You're fine," said the more distant voice.  
"你没事的，"那个更远的声音说道。

Asuka turned around. There, in a room that could have been any clinical laboratory in the GeoFront, stood Ritsuko Akagi in duplicate. The nearer Ritsuko wore a casual outfit: blue shorts and a black tank top under a sleeveless white blouse. The further Ritsuko was more as Asuka remembered her: severe with her turtleneck zipped to her chin and wearing a lab coat.  
明日香转过身来。在那里，在一个可能是 GeoFront 内任何临床实验室的房间里，站着两个一模一样的赤木律子。较近的赤木穿着休闲装：蓝色短裤和黑色背心，外罩一件无袖白色衬衫。而较远的赤木则更接近明日香记忆中的样子：严肃，高领拉链拉到下巴，身着实验服。

Beyond her, where the room became uncertain, a third, shapeless shadow of a figure hung in the air.  
在她身后，房间变得模糊不清的地方，空中悬浮着一个模糊不清的第三个人影。

"My mother," the scientist said, "created the Magi System as a tripartite division of her own mind. Casper, her-as-a-woman," she indicated the nearer Ritsuko, who smiled, "and Melchior, her-as-a-scientist," and she indicated herself, her own lips a thin line.  
"我的母亲，"科学家说道，"创造了三位一体的 Magi 系统，这是她自己心灵的三个分面。卡斯帕，作为女性的她，"她指向较近的律子，后者微笑着，"还有梅尔基奥，作为科学家的她，"她指着自己，双唇紧抿成一条线。

Casper added, "And Balthazar, her-as-a-mother."  
卡斯帕补充道："还有巴尔萨泽，作为母亲的她。"

"We weren't sure what to make of that aspect," Melchior said at the shadow, "lacking the pertinent datapoints. However, we wanted to explore the division concept as an exercise in self-reflection."  
"我们不确定如何理解这一面，"梅尔基奥对着阴影说，"缺乏相关数据点。但我们想通过探索这种分割概念来进行自我反思的练习。"

Asuka fell back and pressed herself against the wall, coral green as she remembered. She felt her dress hanging open in the front, the same floral pattern one as that night, and clutched it shut. Her confession felt as fresh as a cut. Everything after, though, that led her to the railing high above the sea, was not so certain.  
明日香向后倒去，紧贴着记忆中的珊瑚绿墙壁。她感觉到自己的裙子在前方敞开，依旧是那晚的花卉图案，于是紧紧抓住裙摆合拢。她的告白如同新伤一般鲜活。然而，之后的一切，将她引至高悬于海面之上的栏杆，却变得不那么确定了。

"You can't remember... let's say 'activities' outside your experience," Melchior explained.  
"你无法回忆起……我们称之为‘超出你经验范围的活动’，"梅尔基奥解释道。

"Such a child," remarked Casper.  
"真是个孩子，"卡斯帕评论道。

"Yes. An imaginative one, at that."  
"是的，而且颇具想象力。"

Melchior stepped closer to Casper and Asuka. "Do you think 'child' could be our third division?"  
梅尔基奥尔走近卡斯帕和飞鸟。“你们觉得‘孩子’会不会是我们的第三部门？”

Casper shook her head. "I can't remember what it felt like to be one anymore."  
卡斯帕摇了摇头。“我已经记不清当孩子是什么感觉了。”

A dripping red spot started to show through their clothes, a circle that spread from a tiny bullet-sized point in the middle.  
一抹鲜红的血迹开始透过他们的衣物显现，从中间一个小小的弹孔大小点向四周扩散成一个圆圈。

"I didn't think we'd ever make it here," Melchior said. "Well, we'll have to think more on this."  
“我没想到我们真的能到这里，”梅尔基奥说。“嗯，我们得再好好想想这件事。”

They both turned to Asuka.  
他们俩都转向了明日香。

"I'm sure we'll find each other again," said Casper.  
"我确信我们还会再相遇的，"卡斯帕说道。

"It's all any of us can do," Melchior added, "until the end of time."  
"这便是我们所有人能做的，"梅尔基奥补充道，"直到时间的尽头。"

Asuka blinked her eyes. The stark white glow of the medical wing was replaced by a dim and orange natural sunlight coming in from an open window. A late afternoon hue.  
明日香眨了眨眼。医疗室刺眼的白色光芒被一束从敞开的窗户透进的昏暗橙色自然阳光所取代，那是傍晚的色调。

She blinked once more to adjust. Asuka beheld a mess of an off campus apartment, chaotic and cluttered. The only conscious order she could discern was that one corner appeared to be just for beer cans as several were stacked in a slanted pyramid off to one side. A trail of clothing followed a twisting, twirling path from the doorway to the bed. A dusty electric fan hummed by the window. Its even droning tone was the only sound.  
她再次眨了眨眼以适应环境。明日香眼前是一间凌乱的校外公寓，杂乱无章。她唯一能察觉到的有序之处是，一个角落似乎专门用来堆放啤酒罐，几个罐子斜斜地堆成了一座金字塔，靠在一侧。一条衣物铺成的路径蜿蜒曲折，从门口延伸至床边。一架积满灰尘的电风扇在窗边嗡嗡作响，其平稳的嗡鸣声是屋内唯一的声响。

The fan blew towards the bed. On the bed sat Misato, alone.  
风扇的风向着床吹去。床上坐着的是独自一人的美里。

Asuka recognized the room from earlier. She had been with Shinji then. The Misato on the bed looked younger than her years in the low light. She pulled on a man's shirt, blue, and buttoned it up with a practiced motion. It hung off her, wrinkled and baggy.  
明日香认出了这个房间，之前她和真嗣一起来过。床上的美里在昏暗的光线下看起来比实际年龄要年轻。她拉过一件男士衬衫，蓝色的，熟练地扣上扣子。衬衫松垮地挂在她的身上，皱巴巴的，显得宽大。

Asuka looked over her shoulder. Her partner in voyeurism wasn't there like before, nor was Misato's own partner from so many years ago.  
明日香回头望去。她的偷窥伙伴不像以前那样在那里，就像多年前美里自己的伙伴一样，也不在了。

"Oh Kaji's long gone," said Misato. "This was all over ages ago."  
“哦，加持早就走了，”美里说，“这一切早就结束了。”

Asuka looked down at her feet. She had gotten an answer, she had gotten much more than that, but she didn't gain an understanding. She clenched and unclenched her fists. The warm afterglow of the room couldn't penetrate her skin.  
明日香低头看着自己的脚。她得到了答案，得到了更多，但她并没有获得理解。她紧握又松开拳头。房间里的温暖余晖无法穿透她的皮肤。

"Why wasn't it like this for me?"  
"为什么我就没有这样的待遇？"

"Come here," Misato beckoned. She patted the bed to her left.  
"过来，" 葛城招手道。她拍了拍自己左边的床。

After Asuka sat at the very lip of the mattress, Misato fell backwards and folded her arms behind her head. She kicked her legs out and let her feet fall down to the floor with twin thumps. She hadn't buttoned the shirt all the way down. It rode up slightly over her midriff, high enough to let a thin white edge of scar tissue peek out.  
在明日香坐到床沿后，葛城向后一倒，双手交叉枕在脑后。她伸直双腿，任由双脚重重地落在地板上，发出两声闷响。她并没有把衬衫扣到底，衣摆微微上扬，露出了腹部一道细白的疤痕。

Asuka turned away. 明日香转过身去。

"I learned to be good," Misato said, "at hinting at more without making it look like an effort. It only takes shrugging my uniform jacket off my shoulders to go from business to pleasure. A whiff of lavender could turn congenial into allure."  
“我学会了如何巧妙暗示，”美里说，“不露痕迹地引人遐想。只需将制服外套从肩上褪下，便能从公务转为私情。一丝薰衣草香，就能让和睦变为诱惑。”

Asuka's hand found one of the flowers on her dress. She crushed it. She couldn't hide anything from Misato, especially not her memories of Misato around the apartment, casual to the point of carelessness, but never giving it all away.  
明日香的手摸到了裙子上的一朵花，她将其捏碎。她无法对美里隐藏任何事，尤其是那些关于美里在公寓里的记忆，随意到近乎漫不经心，却从未完全展露。

"You looked up to me," Misato finished.  
"你曾仰视我，" 惣流总结道。

"I was jealous! You couldn't see?! You wouldn't tell me how! I asked!"  
"我嫉妒了！你看不出来吗？！你不愿意告诉我怎么做！我问过你了！"

Asuka clutched at the neck of her dress, which was fastened all the way to the top. She remembered tearing it open at sea, the way it had really happened. She remembered when she was by the pool at the NERV recreation center pressing her chest in to see if she could get Shinji's eyes to pop out.  
明日香紧抓着她连衣裙的领口，那领口一直扣到最上面。她记得在海上时曾将其撕开，那才是真正发生的事。她还记得在 NERV 休闲中心的泳池边，她用力挤压自己的胸部，试图让真嗣的眼珠子都瞪出来。

"I wanted to know how," Asuka whimpered.  
"我想知道怎么做，" 明日香啜泣着说。

A remembered voice: _It's not for children._  
一个记忆中的声音：这不是给小孩子看的。

Asuka made to lay down on the bed herself.  
明日香自己也准备躺到床上。

"Wait!" said Misato. "Before you do, switch the fan to oscillating. It'll feel so cool."  
"等等！" 三佐说，"在你躺下之前，把风扇调成摆头模式。这样会感觉很凉快。"

Misato was right. When Asuka did lie back, she enjoyed Misato's recollection of the sensation: A pleasant, wafting chill that wafted over her from head to toe.  
三佐说得没错。当明日香真的躺下时，她享受着三佐回忆中的感觉：一阵宜人的凉风，从头到脚轻轻拂过。

"I miss that fan. I drove over it with my car when I moved out, don't ask me how. Anyway, I already told you why. It's because you're a child. You remember."  
"我怀念那台风扇。我搬家时开车把它压坏了，别问我怎么回事。总之，我已经告诉过你原因了。因为你还是个孩子。你记得的。"

Asuka shook her head. "That's not good enough. I know I'm not, you know, 'all grown up' but that doesn't stop men from looking at me."  
明日香摇了摇头。“那还不够好。我知道我还没，怎么说，‘完全长大’，但这并不妨碍男人们看我。”

"That's when you found out that you were a woman," Misato said, chuckling. "That's different, Asuka. It happens at a different time."  
“那就是你发现自己是个女人的时候，”美里笑着说，“那不一样，明日香。每个人的时间点都不同。”

"I thought it was the cramps."  
“我还以为是痛经呢。”

"No, that's not it at all! Think about it. When was the first time you looked in the mirror and saw a woman looking back at you?"  
"不，完全不是那样！想想看，你第一次照镜子看到一个女人回望你是什么时候？"

Asuka thought back, further than she thought she could remember. Misato was there, behind her though not with her, watching.  
明日香努力回忆，比她以为自己能记得的还要久远。那时，美里就在她身后，虽然不在她身边，却在注视着她。

"It was the day I caught that pervert staring," Asuka said. "After class, I went about my business for the day. I went home, I took a shower. Everything felt the same. I dried myself off and wrapped a big towel around me like always. Nothing felt different from the day before to that day. I started toweling off my hair. I stood in front of a mirror to do that. When I reached up to dry myself, I saw. My chest lifted up, too. I had seen them before, but now I saw them the way he saw. Just a little, but enough to make all the difference."  
"那是我抓到那个变态偷看的那天，"明日香说，"放学后，我照常处理自己的事情。我回家，洗了个澡。一切都和往常一样。我擦干身体，像往常一样用大毛巾裹住自己。从昨天到那天，没有任何不同。我开始擦干头发。我站在镜子前做这件事。当我伸手擦干自己时，我看到了。我的胸部也跟着抬起来了。我以前也见过它们，但现在我看到了他眼中的样子。虽然只是一点点，但足以造成天壤之别。"

"Could you even recognize yourself? Being a women means getting found out," Misato continued. "What was I telling Shinji all the time? 'Be a man!' Some good that did, huh? But nobody ever told you 'Asuka, be a woman!' did they? Wasn't for you to choose. You weren't, now you are. They always catch us in the end."  
"你还能认出自己吗？身为女性，意味着终将被识破，" 美里继续说道。"我总是对真嗣说什么来着？'像个男人一样！' 结果呢？但从来没人对你说 '明日香，要像个女人！' 对吧？这不是你能选择的。你以前不是，现在你是了。我们最终总是会被抓住的。

The fan blew a chill up Asuka's leg.  
风扇吹起一阵寒意，沿着明日香的腿上升。

"Being a child is different. Being a child means you're under everybody else's control. Nothing's yours to give," Misato found the edge of her scar with one finger. "And what we get isn't ours to choose."  
"作为孩子是不同的。作为孩子意味着你的一切都受他人掌控。没有什么是你可以给予的，" 美里用一根手指触摸到她伤疤的边缘。"而我们得到的，也不是我们能选择的。

Misato turned on her side to face Asuka.  
碇真嗣侧过身来面对明日香。

"Then you become young. That's when you get out of control: they lied to you, the world isn't fair and it never made sense. After that's adulthood. That's the time when mistakes become regrets because there's no going back to fix them. You just have to make the best of it from then on and make do with what you have left."  
然后你就变年轻了。那时候你就开始失控：他们欺骗了你，世界并不公平，也从未有意义。之后就是成年期。那是错误变成遗憾的时期，因为没有回头路可以修正它们。你只能从那时起尽力而为，用剩下的东西将就着过。

She breathed in and out.  
她深吸一口气，又缓缓呼出。

"I learned I was an adult by voicemail. What do you think of that?"  
"我通过语音留言得知自己成年了。对此你怎么看？"

_Why didn't he call me?_ Asuka thought an unanswerable question into the myriad minds. There was no response, he was truly dead.  
为什么他不给我打电话？明日香将这个无解的问题抛向了无数思绪。没有回应，他真的死了。

Misato nodded. "What could he have said that'd have made it any easier?"  
葛城点了点头。“他还能说什么让这一切变得更容易接受呢？”

Misato was right. Asuka couldn't think of anything. A farewell she'd never accept. A lie about some future visit that never arrived.  
Misato 是对的。Asuka 想不出任何东西。一个她永远不会接受的告别。一个关于未来某次访问的谎言，那次访问从未到来。

"I embarrassed him all the time," Asuka said.  
"我总是让他难堪，" Asuka 说。

Misato shifted. She reached out with her free hand so she could brush Asuka's arm with her fingers. Asuka's skin stayed firm.  
Misato 动了动。她伸出空着的手，用手指轻触 Asuka 的手臂。Asuka 的皮肤依旧紧绷。

"I don't think so. We didn't talk about stuff like that. Really! I don't think he wanted my opinion. Maybe you reminded him too much of me."  
"我不这么认为。我们没谈过那种事。真的！我觉得他并不想要我的意见。可能你让他太想起我了。"

"He wouldn't look at me so that's not it."  
"他都不看我，所以不是那个原因。"

Misato rested her hand on top of Asuka's.  
美里将手放在明日香的手上。

"He took responsibility for your feelings as best he could. He knew more stuff about than you than you do yourself. Sync logs, psych profiles, your grades, everything. The stuff they had on you kids read like an operating manual. Kaji, he didn't understand other people. Ironic for a spy, huh? I guess he knew how they worked, not why. I wonder if that's my fault. That's pretty egotistical, I guess."  
"他尽其所能地承担起你的情感。他对你了解的程度甚至超过了你自己。同步记录、心理档案、你的成绩，所有关于你们这些孩子的资料详尽得就像一本操作手册。加持，他不懂得理解他人。对一个间谍来说，真是讽刺，对吧？我想他知道人们是如何运作的，却不懂为何如此。我在想，这是否是我的过错。这么说来，我还真是自负。"

Asuka pulled her hand away from Misato's. She sat up and hugged her legs to her chest.  
明日香从美里手中抽回自己的手，坐起身来，将双腿紧紧抱在胸前。

"I didn't want to be his burden."  
"我不想成为他的负担。"

"I didn't call you that."  
"我并没有那样称呼你。"

Asuka glowered over her knees.  
明日香怒视着她的膝盖。

"Didn't you, though? I was so stupid! I was so stupid around him because I felt him leaving me behind. He was always going away. He _should_ have left me. I didn't deserve him. I didn't know how to make him stay. Would doing all that—if I could have done it—it wouldn't have worked, would it?"  
"难道不是吗？我真傻！在他身边我总是那么傻，因为我感觉到他正在离我而去。他总是要离开。他本应该离开我的。我不配拥有他。我不知道如何让他留下。即使我做了所有那些事——如果我能做到的话——也不会奏效，对吧？"

Another cycle of the fan brought a sea breeze over Asuka.  
风扇又一次转动，带来了明日香身边的海风。

Asuka drifted off. She resurfaced on her last night at sea, the way it had truly ended. Mr. Kaji had taken her by the shoulders and firmly pushed her back and away so he could sit upright. He pulled the front of her dress closed, then took her trembling hands and clasped them over the torn buttons. He shifted his legs just enough so that she slid off of him and onto the cold steel deck. She felt as though she had slipped off the deck entirely, like she had been cast adrift.  
明日香陷入了沉睡。她再次浮现出脑海的，是她在海上的最后一夜，那真实的结局。卡吉先生抓住她的肩膀，坚定地将她推开，以便自己能坐直。他拉拢她裙子的前襟，然后握住她颤抖的双手，将它们合拢在撕裂的纽扣上。他稍微调整了一下双腿，使她从他身上滑落，跌坐在冰冷的钢制甲板上。她感觉自己仿佛完全从甲板上滑落，就像被抛入了茫茫大海。

"Asuka, you're a very attractive girl. That's why I can't hold you anymore. You understand why it has to be this way. It's too early. For you, I mean."  
“明日香，你是个非常有魅力的女孩。这就是为什么我不能再抱你。你明白为什么必须这样。对你来说，还太早了。”

_I'm not a child!_ she wanted to scream. _It has to be now, right now!_ she tried to cry out though her voice was a husky, wordless hiss. The pounding of her heart made the deck sway under her.  
我不是小孩子！她想尖叫。必须现在，就是现在！她试图大声呼喊，尽管她的声音沙哑，只能发出无言的嘶嘶声。她的心跳使得甲板在她脚下摇晃。

"I have business in Japan that will take up much of my time," Mr. Kaji continued. "Solo. I think that will be good for you. I'll make time for you, too, when I can."  
我在日本的业务会占用我大部分时间，"卡吉先生继续说，"单独行动。我觉得这对你有好处。我也会尽量抽时间陪你的。

He stood up deliberately and extended his hand to Asuka. She looked down at his feet. The words that couldn't quite reach her lips rang out in her mind.  
他故意站起来，向明日香伸出手。她低头看着他的脚。那些无法完全说出口的话在她脑海中回响。

_It's you I need. You're the only one I need!  
我需要的是你。你是我唯一需要的人！_

"You... you're..." 你...你是...

Mr. Kaji squatted down, which made Asuka shake with desperate, futile anticipation. He did not reach out any closer.  
加持先生蹲了下来，这让明日香在绝望中带着徒劳的期待颤抖着。他并没有再伸手靠近。

"I'm the one who's here, that's what I am to you. That's all it is. People come and go throughout our lives, you'll see. When we get to Japan, you'll meet Ayanami and Ikari and I'll be a memory. Give them a chance, okay?"  
"我是此刻在这里的人，这就是我对你的意义。仅此而已。人的一生中，人来人往，你会明白的。当我们到达日本，你会遇见绫波和碇，而我将成为回忆。给他们一个机会，好吗？"

_I can't do this again, Mr. Kaji. I can't do this twice in one life. There isn't enough of me. You have to take me, it has to be you!  
我不能再这样了，葛城先生。我不能在一生中经历两次这样的事。我没有那么多的自己可以付出。你必须带我走，必须是你！_

"I... can't..." "我...做不到..."

"You can, I promise you. Everyone does, sooner or later. The other Children will understand you better than I ever could. You'll share the same burdens together."  
"我保证，你可以的。每个人都会这样，迟早的事。其他的孩子会比我能更好地理解你。你们将共同承担同样的重担。"

The suggestion that she could be anything less than perfect for Kaji revolted her.  
她对任何暗示自己可能不完全适合卡吉的建议感到反感。

"You okay?" "你还好吗？"

Asuka knew when there was nothing left to say. She stretched her face into a smile before looking up.  
明日香知道何时已无话可说。她将脸庞舒展成一个微笑，然后抬头望去。

"I'm fine, I'm fine. I will, Mr. Kaji. I promise," she said. "I will!" she chirped for emphasis. Once she got started, as was often the case, it got easier to pitch her voice up, to be resilient, adamant, to be good. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean—"  
“我没事，我没事。我会的，葛城先生。我保证，”她说道。“我会的！”她为了强调而欢快地补充。一旦开始，就像往常一样，提高声调、保持坚韧、坚决、表现出色变得容易起来。“对不起，我不是故意——”

Mr. Kaji waved her words away. He stood back up and brushed himself off.  
葛城先生挥手打断了她的话。他站起身来，拍了拍身上的尘土。

"For what it's worth, It's not so fair to call you a kid. We all depend on how you can do things nobody else can. That'll make you stronger. Whatever you choose, do it because you'll come out of it stronger and wiser than before. It'll get you in the habit, trust me. I'll leave you alone for a while."  
"不管怎么说，叫你小孩不太公平。我们都依赖你能做到别人做不到的事情。这会让你更强大。无论你选择什么，都要因为这会让你比以往更坚强、更明智。这会养成你的习惯，相信我。我会暂时离开你。"

_Please don't leave me! 请不要离开我！_

"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Kaji."  
"好的。谢谢你，葛城先生。"

In the off campus apartment, the sun had since set and the fan blew an uncomfortable evening chill over the two.  
在校园外的公寓里，太阳早已落下，风扇吹来的是令人不适的晚间寒意，笼罩着两人。

"Yeah," whispered Misato. "He did enjoy his time with you. A man like Kaji gets to choose his own company. Eventually, being around him got too dangerous. He didn't know how to spare your feelings. Blame me for that."  
“嗯，” 美里低声说道，“他确实和你在一起时很开心。像加持这样的男人，可以选择自己的伙伴。但最终，与他相处变得太危险了。他不知道如何顾及你的感受。这都怪我。”

Misato swayed herself upright to sit cross-legged. She shook her head.  
美里摇摇晃晃地坐直，盘起腿来。她摇了摇头。

"Kaji didn't let anybody inside."  
"加治不让任何人进去。"

_If I can't have all of you, I don't want any of you!_ Asuka recalled.  
如果我不能拥有全部的你，那我宁愿不要任何一部分！明日香回忆道。

"Even when we were together—way back, I mean—he used to say he felt like I was staring at him from across a river. We'd wade over from time to time but couldn't bridge it."  
"即使在我们在一起的时候——我是说很久以前——他常说感觉我像是从河对岸凝视着他。我们偶尔会涉水过去，但却无法架起那座桥。"

Asuka sat up, too. 明日香也坐了起来。

"Let me see your scar?"  
“让我看看你的伤疤？”

Misato nodded. She unbuttoned her shirt up to the middle and pulled the fabric aside. White and sharp, curved in a cruel arc, the scar bent from the right down past her ribs.  
美里点点头。她解开衬衫中间的扣子，将布料拉开。一道白色而锋利的疤痕，以一种残酷的弧线弯曲，从右侧向下延伸过她的肋骨。

Asuka looked at Misato's scar. She looked then at her right hand. She blinked her eyes, both of them.  
明日香看着美里身上的伤疤。她又看了看自己的右手。她眨了眨双眼。

"Why do you have a scar here? This is all fake."  
“你这里为什么会有伤疤？这一切都是假的。”

"It's the realest part about me."  
“这是我身上最真实的一部分。”

Asuka reached over and through the tissue. She could hear her own voice raving over sharing the apartment bath. She could hear herself throwing things, screaming in desperation. Her feelings were those of Misato's: a helpless knot deep in her stomach. She withdrew her hand.  
明日香伸手穿过纸巾。她能听到自己声音在抱怨共用公寓浴室。她能听到自己在扔东西，绝望地尖叫。她的感受如同美里的一样：一种无助的纠结深埋在胃里。她缩回了手。

Misato had trouble meeting Asuka's eyes.  
美里难以直视明日香的眼睛。

"Kaji, he taught me that, when you have the choice, to run towards hopelessness. I mean, by what he did and how he ended up. I hated it when he gave me advice and didn't listen. I think that, when you do, you'll find somebody else there, and maybe there's hope in that, to be with someone else. I learned too late. I'm sorry."  
“加持，他教会我，当你面临选择时，要向绝望奔跑。我是说，通过他的所作所为和最终的结局。我讨厌他给我建议却不听我的。我想，当你这么做时，你会发现那里还有别人，也许与他人相伴中还有希望。我学得太晚了。对不起。”

Asuka pushed herself off the bed. She shut off the fan. She turned back to Misato who laid back down, turning translucent in the twilight shadows.  
明日香从床上撑起身来。她关掉了风扇。她转回身去看躺在床上、在暮色阴影中变得半透明的葛城。

"I spent a lot of time staring at that ceiling to avoid his eyes," Misato said. "I've got it down perfectly."  
“我花了很多时间盯着天花板，就是为了避开他的目光，”葛城说，“我已经练得炉火纯青了。”

"Wasn't he the man of your dreams or something pathetic like that?"  
“他不是你梦寐以求的男人，或者类似那种可怜的东西吗？”

Misato let out a long sigh that ended with a single chuckle.  
葛城美里长叹一声，末了还轻笑了一下。

"Being with him was like a dream when it was just the two of us in this room. No, we clung to each other like shipwrecked sailors. Nobody dreams about that. Then time ran out. If he had come back? And said all those things?"  
和他在一起时，当房间里只有我们两人，那感觉就像一场梦。不，我们紧紧相依，如同遇难的水手。没人会梦到那种情景。然后时间耗尽了。如果他回来了呢？如果他说了那些话呢？

"It's not fair," said Asuka, "that we can put so much into a guy to need him like that. But he can turn around and tell us to get over him, and do it for him like we owe him a favor for feeling something. When for him anyone would do."  
这太不公平了，"明日香说，"我们如此需要一个人，投入了那么多。但他却可以转身让我们忘记他，还要求我们为他做到这一点，仿佛我们欠他一个人情，只因他有所感觉。而对他来说，任何人都可以。

Misato shook her head. 葛城摇了摇头。

"I told him a terrible lie, you know. That I had found someone else. I thought that being angry and trapping myself in a lie was the only way I'd give up."  
我告诉他一个可怕的谎言，你知道的。我说我找到了别人。我以为生气并让自己陷入谎言是唯一放弃的方式。

The edges of the apartment began to stretch beyond the periphery of Asuka's vision.  
公寓的边缘开始在明日香视野的边缘之外延伸。

"It doesn't work," she said.  
"不管用，" 她说道。

Misato nodded. 葛城点了点头。

"No, it doesn't," Misato said, turning her head to look straight at Asuka. "At least let me show you that."  
"不，不行，" 葛城说着，转过头直视着明日香。"至少让我证明给你看。"

"I'm going to stay here for a while," Misato continued. "It's not so good dwelling on ancient history, but my real calling was archaeology. When you grow up, kid, don't leave so many ruins behind."  
"我打算在这里待一会儿，" 葛城继续说道，"沉溺于古老的历史并不好，但我真正的志向是考古学。等你长大后，孩子，别留下那么多废墟。"

"Grow up? Here? A chip doesn't grow into a computer."  
"长大？在这里？芯片不会长成电脑。"

The white shadow of Misato's presence didn't reply. The ceiling fascinated her. Asuka turned towards the door. Finality followed every footfall.  
葛城那白色的身影没有回应。天花板吸引了她的注意。明日香转向门口，每一步都伴随着终结的沉重。

"Misato?" "碇?"

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

"You should be," Misato replied. "You always made a mess of the bathroom and used up all the hot water. That's a joke, you could laugh! But all the rest? That's on me."  
"你应该记得，" 碇回答道，"你总是把浴室弄得一团糟，还用光所有的热水。这是个笑话，你可以笑一笑！但其他的事？那都是我的错。"

Asuka put her hand on the door handle.  
明日香将手放在门把手上。

"You're both the same," she said. "Neither of you knew what to do with me. So don't be sorry when he can't be."  
"你们俩都一样，" 她说道，"你们都不知道该如何对待我。所以当他做不到时，你也不必道歉。"

Misato's voice answered from far away.  
远处传来葛城美里的声音。

"I'm sorry I left you alone. I thought you had him."  
"对不起，我让你独自一人。我以为你有他在。"

Asuka slid the apartment door open to reveal a NERV elevator.  
明日香推开公寓门，眼前是一部 NERV 的电梯。

"This is stupid." “这太蠢了。”

Rei was there, as well, and she pressed the Door Close button. Asuka didn't remember entering the elevator car.  
绫波也在那里，她按下了关门按钮。明日香不记得自己是怎么进到电梯里的。

"You." "你。"

"I like your analogy. 'A chip doesn't grow into a computer.' It is an apt analogy to our roles here and expresses your increasing grasp of the principles of Instrumentality. I once read this in a book: 'The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the Sun.' An expression of human pessimism that here, that now, proves axiomatic. There can be nothing new in this place for there to be complete and complementary understanding."  
"我喜欢你的比喻。'芯片不会长成电脑。'这个比喻恰如其分地描述了我们在这里的角色，也体现了你对统一原理理解的加深。我曾在书中读到这样一句话：'已发生之事，必将再次发生；已成之事，必将再次成之：太阳底下并无新事。'这是人类悲观主义的表达，在此刻，在此地，却显得不言而喻。在这个地方，不可能有任何新事物，因为一切都是完全且互补的理解。"

"Well that sounds really boring to me. I'd hate to be fourteen forever."  
"这听起来对我来说真的很无聊。我可不想永远十四岁。"

Rei opened her mouth and, to Asuka's astonishment, began to sing. Her voice, weak and thin, stayed in tune.  
绫波张开嘴，令明日香惊讶的是，她开始唱歌了。她的声音微弱而纤细，却保持着音准。

"To everything, turn, turn, turn.  
万物皆有轮回，转啊，转啊，转。

There is a season, turn, turn, turn.  
四季更迭，转啊，转啊，转。

And a time to every purpose under heaven."  
天意之下，万物皆有时。

"That is a song," Rei stated redundantly. "I have grown to appreciate music. Somebody taught me how singing enriches the soul. Do you agree?"  
那是一首歌，" 绫波丽不必要地指出，"我开始欣赏音乐了。有人教过我，歌唱能丰富灵魂。你同意吗？

Asuka rolled her eyes. 明日香翻了个白眼。

"That's fruity even for Shinji if you ask me."  
"这甚至对真嗣来说都太离谱了，如果你问我。"

"It was not Ikari. You have not met him yet. Have you decided?"  
"那不是碇。你还没见过他。你决定了吗？"

The ticking of the floor counter grew louder. Misato's voice and her own called out over the din.  
地板计数器的滴答声越来越响。美里和自己的声音在嘈杂中呼喊着。

"We'd wade over from time to time but couldn't bridge it."  
"我们偶尔会涉水过去，但始终无法跨越。"

_I can't do this twice.  
我无法重来一次。_

"That's the time when mistakes become regrets because there's no going back to fix them."  
"那就是错误变成遗憾的时刻，因为再也没有回头修正的机会。"

_You're the only one I need!  
你是我唯一需要的人！_

"Who?" asked Rei. “谁？”蕾问。

The lights went out. 灯熄灭了。

"Wake up," said Rei. "醒来，" 雷伊说道。

"Hey! Excuse me?!" "嘿！你说什么?!"

"Wake up!" said Rei. "快醒醒！" 雷伊说。

Asuka fumbled for Rei in the dark but she was all tangled up.  
明日香在黑暗中摸索着寻找绫波，但她自己却缠成了一团。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

There was light. Asuka, who had been gaping into the darkness, winced at the shock of brightness.  
光线出现了。一直凝视着黑暗的明日香，被突如其来的明亮刺得眯起了眼睛。

"Wake up!" bellowed Misato as she flung the door wide open. It slid aside with a thump. Asuka could see that was her door, the door to her room in the apartment she had lived with Misato for some time. Somehow she had gotten all knotted up in her sheets.  
"起床了！" 三笠大声吼道，猛地推开门。门砰的一声滑开了。明日香看到那是她的房门，她和三笠同住公寓里她房间的门。不知怎么的，她把自己裹在了床单里。

"Stop napping and get out here and take out the trash! Kaji and Shinji are going to get here any minute!"  
"别打盹了，快出来倒垃圾！加持和真嗣马上就要到了！"

___
Asuka took up two reeking trash bags and marched her charges outside to the dumpsters. One clattered as it held a several weeks' accumulation of beer cans, the other rustled and squished with the remains of half-eaten instant noodle containers. Both stank which helped a chore-shy Asuka far less reluctant to set herself to the task. The still-undiscovered purpose behind Misato's frantic cleaning spree kept her puzzled. She supposed that her boyfriend, Mr. Kaji, was due for a visit, but Misato's urgency felt off.  
明日香拎起两袋散发着恶臭的垃圾，带着这些累赘走向户外的垃圾箱。一袋叮当作响，装着几周积累的啤酒罐；另一袋则沙沙作响，夹杂着未吃完的方便面盒的残骸。两者都散发着难闻的气味，这让本就懒于家务的明日香不那么抗拒去完成这项任务。对于美里突然疯狂打扫背后的未解之谜，她感到困惑。她猜想可能是男友加持先生要来访，但美里的急切似乎有些不对劲。

"He's okay, I guess," Asuka told the trash. "But since when is he worth all this effort? It's not like she's not already getting laid. Pathetic! Imagine rearranging your life around some guy."  
"我觉得他还行吧，"明日香对着垃圾桶说道，"但什么时候他值得这么大费周章了？又不是说她没男人。真可悲！想想看，为了个男人调整自己的生活。"

Their apartment had never been cleaner. Misato and Asuka had scrubbed, dusted, mopped, polished, picked up, and tidied the place to a degree unlike Asuka had seen ever since Misato had taken her in some years ago. Past visits by Mr. Kaji and his own adoptee had inspired Misato to triage the garbage before, though never to such an extent.  
他们的公寓从未如此干净过。美里和明日香又是擦洗，又是除尘，拖地，打蜡，收拾，整理，把地方弄得比明日香自从几年前被美里收养以来见过的任何时候都要整洁。以前卡吉先生和他收养的孩子来访时，美里也会提前处理垃圾，但从未到这种程度。

"It's not like he's never been here before. He knows she's a big slob. No offense," Asuka said. "Then again, they're usually wasted when they barge in and then he sneaks out while it's still dark. Like I don't know! Or can't hear! Gross!"  
"他又不是第一次来这儿。他知道她是个大邋遢鬼。无意冒犯，"明日香说，"不过话说回来，他们通常都是醉醺醺地闯进来，然后他就在天还没亮时偷偷溜走。当我不知道呢！或者听不见似的！真恶心！"

Asuka hurled the first bag into the can collection bin. It sailed in with room to spare and hit the hollow bottom with a deafening racket. Her aim was off with the second bag. It got stuck on the edge of the bin for burnables and didn't quite tumble inside.  
明日香将第一个袋子扔进了回收箱。它轻松地飞进去，撞到空荡荡的底部，发出震耳欲聋的响声。第二个袋子她的准头就差了些，卡在了可燃垃圾桶的边缘，没能完全掉进去。

"Oh no, is she thinking about marriage? And she tricked me into helping lay her trap? I guess she's getting old. Clock's ticking. Soon she'll be a barren and won't get to replace me with one of her own."  
哦不，她是不是在考虑结婚？还骗我来帮她设陷阱？看来她年纪大了，时间不等人。很快她就会失去生育能力，再也不能用她自己的后代来取代我了。

She planted a high kick precisely where she had to to send the bag into the bin. It fell in with a wet smack.  
她准确地踢出一记高踢，将袋子送入垃圾桶。袋子落入桶中，发出一声湿漉漉的啪嗒声。

When she arrived back at the apartment, there were two more pairs of shoes in the entrance that hadn't been there before.  
当她回到公寓时，入口处多了两双之前没有的鞋子。

"Asuka?" Misato called from the kitchen. "Come in! What took you so long?"  
“明日香？”美里在厨房喊道，“进来吧！怎么这么晚？”

"Nothing, Misato! Coming, Misato!" Asuka growled back, kicking her shoes off and into the guests' to make a chaotic heap. She stomped her way into the kitchen to meet three faces smiling back at her from around the table.  
“没什么，美里！来了，美里！”明日香没好气地回应，踢掉鞋子，把它们和客人的鞋子混在一起，弄得乱七八糟。她大步走进厨房，只见三张笑脸从餐桌周围向她微笑。

"Hello, Asuka-chan!" said Mr. Kaji. She hated how casual he was with her and how it put her at ease before she could catch herself. Asuka supposed that's how Misato got taken in by his charms.  
"你好，明日香！" 卡吉先生说道。她讨厌他那种随意的态度，这让她在意识到之前就感到放松。明日香猜想，这就是美里被他的魅力所吸引的原因。

"Hello, Soryu-san," Shinji murmured towards the floor by Asuka's feet. On the other hand, Asuka enjoyed the deference she received from Mr. Kaji's ward.  
"你好，惣流小姐，" 真嗣对着明日香脚下的地板低声说道。另一方面，明日香喜欢从卡吉先生的养子那里得到的尊敬。

"Uh, hi. What's going on?"  
"呃，嗨。发生什么事了？"

Misato gave Asuka her best maternal frown. "Asuka! Please, come sit! Ryoji and I have some news."  
碇真嗣，你这个笨蛋！你以为你是谁？你以为你能拯救世界吗？别做梦了！

"Oh no, you're breaking up? So sad! Hey, that's my seat, Ikari!"  
哦不，你们要分手了？真伤心！嘿，那是我的座位，碇！

She slapped the back of Shinji's head before he had a chance to stand.  
在她有机会站起来之前，她拍了拍碇真嗣的后脑勺。

"Oh! I'm sorry!" he mumbled, scrambling over to the other chair. Mr. Kaji laughed while Misato tutted. Asuka scrunched her nose when she sat down: the chair was already warm.  
"哦！对不起！"他嘟囔着，急忙挪到另一把椅子上。卡吉先生笑了，而美里则啧啧有声。当明日香坐下时，她皱了皱鼻子：椅子已经温热了。

"Alright you two, enough for a while, OK? Me and Ryoji have some news. It turns out that their apartment building was condemned by the city inspector after the last aftershock."  
"好了，你们两个，暂时够了，好吗？我和良治有些消息。原来他们的公寓楼在上一次余震后被城市检查员判定为危房。"

It was then that Asuka noticed the suitcases.  
就在那时，明日香注意到了那些行李箱。

"Oh no," she blurted out. "Oh no no no..."  
"哦不，"她脱口而出。"哦不不不..."

"And, well, this was something we were thinking about doing, anyway, so..."  
"而且，嗯，这本来就是我们考虑要做的事情，所以..."

Mr. Kaji took Misato's hand and squeezed.  
加持先生握住美里小姐的手，紧紧地捏了一下。

"So I proposed to her," he said.  
"于是我向她求婚了," 他说道。

Asuka's jaw dropped. Out of the corner of her eye she could see that Shinji beamed with joy.  
明日香的嘴巴张得老大。她眼角的余光瞥见真嗣满脸喜悦。

"And Misato invited us to come live here with you two," he said directly to Asuka. "If that's alright with you?"  
"而美里邀请我们搬来这里和你们一起住," 他直接对明日香说。"如果你不介意的话？"

"It's not," she said. "这不是，" 她说。

"She doesn't get a vote!" Misato retorted before planting a big kiss on Mr. Kaji's cheek.  
"她没有投票权！" 惣流反击道，随即在加持先生的脸颊上重重地吻了一下。

"Well where's that one going to go?" Asuka snarled back, pointing at Shinji with her thumb. "If you think I'll share my room with some perverted little boy...!"  
"那这家伙要住哪儿？" 明日香反驳道，用拇指指向真嗣。"如果你认为我会和一个变态小男孩共用一个房间...！"

"Oh no, he'll go in that smaller room. That's why we cleared it out."  
"哦不，他会进那个小房间的。这就是我们为什么要清理它的原因。"

"But that's barely more than a closet! Where is Mr. Kaji going to sleep?"  
"但那几乎就是一个壁橱！卡吉先生要在哪里睡觉呢？"

Asuka flinched at her own oversight. _Am I stupid?_  
明日香因为自己的疏忽而感到一阵紧张。我是不是很笨？

Misato burst out laughing. Mr. Kaji struggled but failed to keep himself from smirking knowingly at his wife-to-be. Asuka felt her face flush deep red. She turned to Shinji and saw he was similarly blushing.  
明日香突然大笑起来。加持先生努力忍住，但还是忍不住带着一丝了然的微笑看向即将成为他妻子的美里。明日香感到自己的脸颊变得通红。她转向真嗣，发现他也同样脸红了。

"I'll tell you all about that when you're older!" Misato laughed.  
等你长大些我再告诉你那些事！"美里笑着说。

After the other two had left to gather more of their belongings, Asuka helped Misato wash the dishes. She was typically difficult when it came to chores, but recent events left her too unsteady to affect her usual attitude.  
另外两人离开去收拾更多行李后，明日香帮美里洗碗。她平时对家务活总是很抵触，但最近发生的事情让她心神不宁，无法维持平时的态度。

"Talk to me. I know you're angry," said Misato. She bumped Asuka lightly with her hip.  
"跟我说话吧。我知道你在生气，" 美里说道，她用臀部轻轻撞了一下明日香。

Asuka let the dish she scrubbed splash down into the sink.  
明日香将她正在擦洗的盘子猛地扔进水槽。

"I'm not angry with you! You deserve to be happy. I don't—! I'd never—!"  
"我不是生你的气！你应该幸福。我——！我永远不会——！"

"I know that, Asuka-chan," Misato said. She pulled her into a soapy side embrace. Asuka flinched at Misato's damp touch.  
"我知道了，明日香，" 美里说道。她将她拉入一个沾满泡沫的侧抱中。明日香因美里湿润的触碰而微微一缩。

"Can't we just get a pet?" she suggested. "How about a penguin?"  
"我们不能养个宠物吗？" 她提议道，"比如一只企鹅怎么样？"

Misato laughed. "A penguin?!"  
美里笑了起来。"一只企鹅？！"

Asuka rested her head against Misato's collarbone. She listened to the beating of her heart and waited until her own was just as steady before continuing.  
明日香将头靠在美里锁骨上，聆听着她的心跳，直到自己的心跳也变得同样平稳，才继续说道。

"It's just that they might hear me. When I cry at night, you know?"  
只是他们可能会听见我。你知道的，我晚上哭的时候。

Misato let out a breath. She sat down at the table and pulled Asuka sideways into her lap.  
美里深吸一口气，坐到桌边，将明日香侧身拉入自己怀中。

"What if we tried to get you some help again?"  
"如果我们再试着帮你找些帮助呢？"

Asuka shook her head. She clamped her eyes shut.  
明日香摇了摇头，紧紧闭上了眼睛。

"Asuka, I know I'm not your..." Misato said, eliding over the difficult word. "But since you came to me, since you entered my life, I've tried to do my best to do right by you. What did I know about raising a kid? What do I know now? I'm not all that much older than you."  
"明日香，我知道我不是你的……"" 美里说到这里，避开了那个难以启齿的词，""但既然你来到了我这里，既然你进入了我的生活，我就尽力做到最好，对你负责。我对于养育孩子知道些什么呢？现在又知道些什么呢？我也没比你大多少。"

Asuka snorted. 明日香哼了一声。

"You little—!" Misato yelped and gave her a little shake, which also shook loose a tear from the corner of her eye. It fell with a pat onto Asuka's cheek below.  
“你这个小——！” 美里惊叫着，轻轻摇了摇她，这一摇也震落了她眼角的一滴泪。泪珠啪的一声落在明日香脸颊下。

"I've made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life. One of them was pushing Ryoji away. Then I made a lot more mistakes before I realized I could undo some of them. When I looked him up, the worst part wasn't worrying if he had found somebody else. Isn't that strange? I could have taken heartbreak. Goodness knows I've had my heart broken over and over. My worst fear was if I could say the words I couldn't say all those years ago."  
“我一生中犯过很多愚蠢的错误。其中一个就是把凌司推开。之后我又犯了很多错误，直到我意识到我可以纠正其中一些。当我找到他时，最糟糕的不是担心他是否已经找到了别人。这不是很奇怪吗？我可以承受心碎。天知道我的心已经碎了一次又一次。我最害怕的是，我能否说出那些多年前我说不出口的话。”

Misato paused, her face all aglow. Asuka looked up at her and was taken by how beautiful Misato looked when her mind was elsewhere.  
碇真嗣停顿了一下，脸上洋溢着光彩。明日香抬头看着她，被碇真嗣在心不在焉时展现出的美丽所吸引。

"It meant admitting how all of our time together had meant more than it appeared on the surface. That not letting him in was a choice and that I chose poorly. I don't know if any of this even makes sense. Just don't give up on yourself, okay? I'll never give up on you, I promise. I love you so much."  
这意味着承认我们在一起的时光实际上比表面看起来更有意义。不让他进入我的内心是一种选择，而我选择了错误。我不知道这些是否还有意义。只是不要放弃自己，好吗？我永远不会放弃你，我保证。我非常爱你。

Visions took the place of sight. A doll. A noose. Her mother swaying back and forth.  
幻象取代了视觉。一个玩偶。一根绞索。她的母亲来回摇摆。

Asuka shook her head again.  
明日香再次摇了摇头。

"I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't."  
“我做不到。我做不到，我做不到，我做不到。”

On the walk to school the next day, the bright glare of the morning sun nearly met its match in how Asuka glowered at Shinji.  
第二天上学路上，早晨的阳光明媚得几乎与明日香对真嗣怒目而视的目光相匹敌。

"Come on, Ikari, keep up!" Asuka said, taking hold of Shinji's hand. "I agreed to walk you to school, not carry you there!"  
"快点，碇，跟上！" 明日香说着，抓住了真嗣的手。"我答应陪你走到学校，可没说要背你过去！"

Shinji kept gawking at the sleek, modern skyline of Tokyo-3. Like many children, he had been orphaned by the Second Great Kanto Earthquake. Somehow he had come into the care of Ryoji Kaji who lived in Tokyo-2, a ramshackle development thrown together by the UN emergency authorities to house millions of homeless people as expediently as possible.  
真嗣目不转睛地盯着东京-3 那流线型、现代化的天际线。和许多孩子一样，他在第二次大关东地震中成了孤儿。不知怎么的，他被住在东京-2 的加持良治收养了，东京-2 是联合国紧急当局为了尽快安置数百万无家可归者而匆忙搭建的临时住所。

Asuka, on the other hand, had grown up in the so-called earthquake-proof Tokyo-3 developed by the NERV Corporation, an NGO that employed her own guardian and formerly her parents. Asuka considered herself orphaned by the same cataclysm, but it wasn't the earthquake that killed her mother.  
另一方面，明日香在 NERV 公司开发的所谓抗震城市东京-3 长大，这家非政府组织雇佣了她的监护人，也曾是她的父母的雇主。明日香也自认为在那场灾难中成了孤儿，但夺走她母亲生命的并非地震。

Pushing those feelings back into the deep numbness within her soul, she yanked Shinji along the sidewalk towards the school.  
将那些情感重新压回灵魂深处的麻木之中，她拽着真嗣沿着人行道向学校走去。

She felt a twinge inside herself pulling her away from the wrong path, like a tug at her sleeve. Asuka stopped hauling Shinji forward and let him draw even with her.  
她感到内心有一丝牵扯，将她从错误的道路上拉开，就像有人轻扯她的衣袖。明日香停止拖拽真嗣，让他与自己并肩而行。

"I'm sorry, that was rude of me," Asuka whispered, hardly believing the words coming out of her mouth.  
“对不起，我刚才太无礼了，”明日香低声说道，几乎不敢相信这些话是从自己嘴里说出来的。

"Oh no, I'm sorry for being so slow. It's just I've hardly been here before. It's all so new to me. Mr. Kaji and me come from Tokyo-2. I'm sorry, you probably know that already."  
"哦不，对不起，我太慢了。只是我几乎没来过这里。对我来说一切都是那么新鲜。我和卡吉先生来自第二新东京市。对不起，您可能已经知道了。"

She bit her tongue before she could call him a wimp.  
她咬住舌头，才没叫他懦夫。

"I did but that's OK. You were orphaned by the Second Quake, too?"  
"我也是，但没关系。你也是第二次冲击的孤儿吗？"

"Too? Oh, uh, yeah." "还问？哦，呃，是的。"

Asuka flinched at her own slip-up. Of course Mr. Kaji must have told him her family history. Of course he'd know that his mother didn't really die in the quake, just that she died because of it. She swallowed another bitter outburst and decided to let that pass.  
明日香因为自己的失言而畏缩了一下。当然，加持先生肯定已经告诉了他自己的家庭背景。他当然知道，他的母亲并非真的死于地震，而是因为地震而死。她咽下了又一次苦涩的爆发，决定让这件事过去。

_There has to be a better way to go about this... Woah, I'm still holding his hand.  
一定有更好的方法来处理这件事...哇，我还在握着他的手。_

"So, I don't know, what was that like for you?" she asked.  
"那么，我不太清楚，那对你来说是什么样的感觉？" 她问道。

Shinji eyed Asuka carefully.  
真嗣仔细地打量着明日香。

"It was hard at first. I'm sure you know. But after a while I learned that you have to focus on living, you know? When things calmed down, Mr. Kaji found me. I realized that there was still life all around. Maybe even that I owed it to my parents, to everyone who died, to keep living for their sake. I know that it can be harder for others..."  
"起初确实很难。我相信你也能理解。但过了一段时间，我学会了专注于生活，你知道吗？当一切平静下来后，卡吉先生找到了我。我意识到周围仍然有生命存在。也许我甚至欠我的父母，欠所有逝去的人，为了他们继续活下去。我知道这对其他人来说可能更难……"

He gave her hand a squeeze before releasing it. They had reached the schoolyard.  
他握了握她的手，然后松开。他们已经到达了校园。

"Yeah, I guess," said Asuka, not sure about the jolt that ran up her arm.  
“嗯，我想是的，”明日香说道，不确定手臂上那股电流是怎么回事。

Mr. Fuyutsuki raised his eyebrow when he saw Asuka enter class 2-A with Shinji in tow.  
当看到明日香带着真嗣走进 2-A 教室时，冬月老师挑了挑眉毛。

"Has Soryu-kun met a young man?"  
"小绿君见过一个年轻人吗？"

"You mean my future stepbrother?"  
"你是指我未来的继兄吗？"

Mr. Fuyutsuki's eyes bulged out, but he recovered from his initial shock quickly.  
冬月先生的眼睛瞪得老大，但他很快就从最初的震惊中恢复过来。

"Ah, so you must be Shinji Ikari-kun, our new student? Why don't you introduce yourself to the class?"  
"啊，那你一定就是新同学碇真嗣君了吧？不如向大家做个自我介绍怎么样？"

Shinji did as he was told. He wrote his name on the blackboard in thin, tidy strokes. The other students murmured half-hearted greetings.  
真嗣按照吩咐做了。他在黑板上用细小而整齐的笔触写下了自己的名字。其他学生则半心半意地小声打着招呼。

"Now why don't you sit in that empty desk by the window, Ikari-kun?"  
"那么，你就坐在窗边那个空位上吧，碇君？"

"Yes, Fuyutsuki-sensei!" "是的，冬月老师！"

"Perfect, let's begin today's lesson on life before the Second Kanto Earthquake."  
"很好，我们开始今天的课程，主题是第二次关东大地震之前的生活。"

The classroom groaned in unison.  
教室里响起了一片哀嚎声。

When the lunch bell chimed, Asuka shot out of her chair and made for Shinji but she was too slow. The class dunce squad, Toji and Kensuke, had already cornered him.  
当午餐铃声响起时，明日香从椅子上弹起，冲向真嗣，但她还是慢了一步。班上的笨蛋二人组，东治和健介，已经把他围住了。

"Hey Ikari, welcome to Tokyo-3! My name's Kensuke Aida!"  
嘿，碇，欢迎来到第三新东京市！我叫相田健介！

"I'm Toji, nice to meet ya! When we heard about a transfer, we were afraid it was going to be another chick. They can be so stuck up, y'know?"  
我是东治，很高兴见到你！听说有转学生来，我们还担心又是个女生。她们有时候挺自以为是的，你懂的。

Shinji smiled pleasantly and bowed to each.  
真嗣微笑着愉快地向每个人鞠躬。

"Yeah this class is already, uh, whatever the opposite of a sausage fest is. Hey! Speaking of die Wurst..." Kensuke began before Asuka shoved the two of them aside.  
“是啊，这个班级已经是，呃，怎么说呢，香肠派对的反义词。嘿！说到香肠……”健介开始说，但明日香把他们俩推到了一边。

"Back off, Dummköpfe, he's mine for lunch."  
“退后，笨蛋们，他是我午餐的。”

"Woah, slow down, we saw him first!" whined Toji.  
"哇，慢点，是我们先看到他的！" 东治抱怨道。

"Actually I did because I saw him right after I woke up! So if you'll—! No! Wait a minute!"  
"实际上是我先看到的，因为我醒来后立刻就看到他了！所以如果你能——！不！等一下！"

The boys in the class broke into a low whistle.  
班上的男生们发出了一阵低低的口哨声。

"It's not like that!" she snapped.  
"不是那样的！" 她厉声说道。

"Children, children! Let's act rational, please," Mr. Fuyutsuki called out.  
"孩子们，孩子们！请理智一点，" 冬月先生喊道。

"Soryu-san," Shinji said, "I'd love for you to show me around sometime, but I'd like to meet some new people first, okay? We'll have plenty of time to catch up at home."  
"惣流小姐，" 真嗣说，"我很希望你能带我四处看看，但我还是想先认识些新朋友，好吗？我们回家后有的是时间叙旧。"

The girls in the class oohed and ahhed this time, but were shut down by an icy blue glare from Asuka. I still get all those notes from your so-called boyfriends! Don't make me read them out loud!  
这次班上的女生们又是一阵惊叹，却被明日香冰蓝色的冷眼瞪了回去。我还收到你那些所谓男友的信呢！别逼我当众念出来！

She turned to Shinji. 她转向真嗣。

"Fine! See you at home, then, bye!"  
“好吧！那家里见，再见！”

Pivoting on her heel, Asuka stormed out of the class with her bento.  
猛地转身，明日香带着她的便当怒气冲冲地走出了教室。

Asuka sat under a shady tree in the schoolyard. The cool spring air along with the shade was uncomfortably cold, but she refused to budge. She also refused to eat, instead gripping her bento box shut with white knuckles.  
明日香坐在校园里一棵树荫下。凉爽的春风加上树荫，冷得让人不舒服，但她坚决不动。她也不肯吃饭，而是紧握着便当盒，手指关节都发白了。

"Why am I in such a rush? What is wrong with me? I have all the time in the world to do this! Calm down! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!"  
“我为什么这么急躁？我这是怎么了？我有的是时间做这件事！冷静下来！笨蛋！笨蛋！笨蛋！”

In the distance, she could hear Toji speaking.  
远处，她能听到东治的声音。

"Your funeral, bud! See ya back at class!"  
你的葬礼，伙计！课堂上见！

Asuka looked over in the direction of Toji's voice to see Shinji approaching her while his newly made friends rapidly retreated.  
明日香朝东治声音的方向望去，看到真嗣正向她走来，而他新结识的朋友们迅速撤离。

"Hey, Soryu-san! Mind if I sit here?"  
"嘿，Soryu 先生！介意我坐这儿吗？"

Asuka scowled at him, but remembered herself. She scooted over to allow him to sit, which only increased her discomfort. The new patch of bench where she sat was cold. She patted the empty spot rather than speak lest she spit some venom and ruin the mood.  
Asuka 瞪了他一眼，但随即意识到自己的失态。她挪了挪位置，让他坐下，这反而让她更加不舒服。她刚坐下的那块长椅冰冷刺骨。她拍了拍空位，没有开口，生怕一说话就吐出些毒液，破坏了气氛。

"Thanks! Hey, I hope I didn't hurt your feelings earlier. I wanted to get off on the right foot with Suzuhara-kun and Aida-kun back there, that's all."  
"谢谢！嘿，希望我之前没有伤到你的感情。我只是想和 Suzuhara 君还有 Aida 君那边有个好的开始，仅此而已。"

"No, that's fine, Ikari-kun," Asuka said. Then, swallowing bile, she forced out, "Sorry for being a bitch about it."  
"不，没事，碇君，" 明日香说道。随后，她咽下苦涩，勉强挤出一句，"抱歉，我刚才态度太恶劣了。"

Shinji laughed lightly, which gave Asuka a light feeling in her stomach.  
真嗣轻声笑了，这让明日香感到一阵轻松。

"You weren't, truly! You seemed like you wanted to talk to me, though, so here I am. What's up?"  
"你真的没有！不过你看起来好像有话要说，所以我来了。怎么了？"

Asuka cocked her head at Shinji.  
明日香歪着头看向真嗣。

"Huh? Now it's too easy?"  
“嗯？现在变得太简单了？”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

Asuka waved away his confusion.  
明日香挥手驱散了他的困惑。

"Well," she started, placing her bento box aside and smoothing her skirt. "It was about what we were talking about earlier. You know. Orphans and stuff?"  
"嗯，"她开口道，将便当盒放到一边，整理了一下裙子。"就是之前我们讨论的那个话题。你知道的，关于孤儿之类的？"

Shinji nodded. He turned his full attention onto her.  
真嗣点了点头，将全部注意力转向了她。

"Well, my father died in the quake but not my mother. My mother, she died later than that."  
"其实，我父亲是在地震中去世的，但我母亲不是。我母亲是在那之后去世的。"

"I know," Shinji whispered, then gasped when a strange grimace crossed Asuka's face. "Oh, I'm so sorry! I mean, Mr. Kaji had told me so I'd know, you know? But you tell it. I want to hear it from you."  
"我知道，" 真嗣低声说道，随后当明日香脸上掠过一个奇怪的苦笑时，他倒吸了一口气。"哦，真对不起！我是说，加持先生已经告诉我了，所以我才知道，你懂的？但我想听你亲口说。

He reached over to Asuka to give her shoulder a brief squeeze. Her soul felt like it was somersaulting across the sun. Her eyes stung but she found it was easy to smile at him.  
他伸手过去，轻轻地捏了捏明日香的肩膀。她的灵魂仿佛在太阳上翻腾。她的眼睛刺痛，但她发现对他微笑变得很容易。

"It started with a doll."  
"一切始于一个玩偶。"

On the walk home, Asuka indulged all of Shinji's curiosity about Tokyo-3. The elaborate stress dampeners built under every highrise fascinated him. He showed a great interest in earthquake engineering which mortified Asuka. She couldn't understand why he'd want to study the force that killed his family. Each stop to examine this or that mechanism delayed them, but that worked to her advantage. It gave her time to think.  
在回家的路上，明日香满足了真嗣对第三新东京市的好奇心。每座高楼下方精心建造的减震器让他着迷。他对地震工程表现出了极大的兴趣，这让明日香感到不安。她无法理解他为何想要研究那股夺走他家人的力量。每次停下来检查这些或那些机制都会让他们耽搁，但这正合她意。这给了她时间去思考。

She had spilled her guts about her mother back at the schoolyard. Some of the details she gave didn't feel quite real, but they rang true and he accepted it all without question. After she finished, all he did was lean forward and embrace her. She thought she might pop like a balloon.  
她在学校操场上倾诉了关于母亲的一切。有些细节她觉得并不完全真实，但听起来却很真切，而他毫无质疑地接受了这一切。她讲完后，他只是向前倾身，拥抱了她。她觉得自己可能会像气球一样爆开。

_Look at that idiot. 看那个傻瓜。_

Shinji leaned over a ledge to peer into an aftershock absorber he found particularly engrossing.  
真嗣俯身探出栏杆，凝视着一个他觉得特别吸引人的余震吸收器。

Asuka felt her cheeks tingling.  
明日香感到双颊微微发烫。

_I think I could love him.  
我想我可能会爱上他。_

"Come on, silly, let's go home," she said, hooking her arm through his. Shinji, his eyes agape, let her lead him away.  
"快点，傻瓜，我们回家吧，" 她说着，挽起他的胳膊。真嗣瞪大了眼睛，任由她领着他离开。

Back at the apartment, they found a note in Misato's hasty scrawl.  
回到公寓，他们发现了一张用美里潦草字迹写的便条。

Dear Shinji ❤ and Asuka ❤  
亲爱的真嗣 ❤ 和明日香 ❤  
Your very responsible guardians are  
你那极其负责任的监护人  
getting very drunk at the reception  
今晚在招待会上喝得酩酊大醉  
tonight and will stay at hotel.  
并将留宿酒店。  
Food in fridge. 冰箱里有食物。  
ASUKA:  
(1) NO BEER (1) 没有啤酒  
(2) BE NICE TO SHIN-CHAN  
(2) 对新酱好一点  
❤LOVE❤ ❤爱❤

She had signed it with a lipstick print.  
她用唇印签了名。

Asuka threw the fridge door wide. "So you want a beer?" she asked Shinji. He stammered out a polite refusal.  
明日香猛地拉开冰箱门。“想喝啤酒吗？”她问真嗣。他结结巴巴地婉拒了。

Suddenly self-conscious, she added "I only drink one occasionally, honest. Guess it makes me feel like a grown up, you know? She keeps herself so stocked up that she never notices one or two gone."  
突然感到有些尴尬，她补充道：“我偶尔才喝，真的。只是觉得这样能让我感觉像个大人，你懂的。她冰箱里总是备得满满的，少了一两瓶也注意不到。”

Shinji shrugged. He still didn't accept one. Asuka cracked hers open and sipped.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。他依旧没有接受。明日香打开自己的那瓶，小口啜饮起来。

"Sorry about the food in advance. All we got is instant crap and frozen stuff."  
"提前为食物道歉。我们这里只有速食垃圾和冷冻食品。"

Shinji stopped staring at the beer in her hand. His eyes lit up and met Asuka's.  
真嗣停止了盯着她手中的啤酒。他的眼睛一亮，与明日香对视。

"I could cook something if you like," he offered. Asuka raised her eyebrow.  
"如果你愿意，我可以做点什么，"他提议道。明日香挑了挑眉。

"So my new roommate cooks, huh? You any good?"  
"这么说我的新室友会做饭啊？手艺怎么样？"

"Well, Mr. Kaji thinks so!" Shinji said. He puffed out his chest. "I've had a lot of practice. He doesn't exactly keep a regular schedule so I'm on my own when it comes to meals. He gives me an allowance and calls it my 'chef's salary' but I'd do it for free, anyway. It's not like I pay for the food, and he's done so much for me."  
"嗯，卡吉先生是这么认为的！" 碇真嗣说道，他挺起胸膛。"我练习了很多。他的作息时间不太规律，所以吃饭的事我得自己解决。他给我零用钱，称之为我的'厨师薪水'，但其实就算不给我也会做的。毕竟食物不是我买的，而且他为我做了很多。"

"Wunderbar! Then the kitchen is yours, Chef Ikari," Asuka said with a sarcastically deep bow.  
"太棒了！那么厨房就归你了，碇厨师，" 明日香带着夸张的深鞠躬说道。

"Wun-deru-ba-ru?" Shinji sounded out. "That's funny! What's that?"  
"Wun-deru-ba-ru?" 真嗣试着念了出来。"真有趣！那是什么？"

"Yeah, sure. I'm going to go change." She tugged her red ribbon loose and off her neck.  
"好的，我这就去换衣服。" 她解开脖子上的红色丝带，将其取下。

Shinji looked away shyly.  
真嗣害羞地移开了视线。

_Mein Gott, he's so precious.  
我的天啊，他真是太可爱了。_

"Hey, Shinji? Can I call you that?"  
嘿，真嗣？我可以这么叫你吗？

Shinji smiled at her for the first time.  
真嗣第一次对她露出了微笑。

"Yeah, um, Asuka." "嗯，那个，明日香。"

Asuka let herself shake once she reached the privacy of her room.  
明日香一回到自己房间的私密空间，就忍不住颤抖起来。

"A whole night alone with him? Misato, thank you for being so neglectful!"  
"整整一晚和他独处？美里，感谢你的疏忽大意！"

Asuka drained the beer. 明日香喝光了啤酒。

Asuka took off her school dress, blouse, and socks, tossing them every which way. Ordinarily she and Misato dressed quite casually around each other. _It's just us girls, nothing to be shy about_, she'd say. Asuka supposed that would have to change. Misato had said some comments to her about how she was "filling out" recently. Asuka supposed she had meant it as a compliment, but the memory filled her with cool apprehension.  
明日香脱下校服裙、衬衫和袜子，随手扔得到处都是。通常她和美里在一起时穿着都很随意。她总是说，就我们两个女生，没什么好害羞的。明日香觉得这种习惯得改改了。美里最近对她说过一些关于她“发育”的评论。明日香猜想美里本意是想夸奖她，但这个记忆让她感到一阵凉意。

Asuka looked down. 明日香低头看了看。

"I should at least wear a shirt or I'll shock the poor boy."  
"我至少应该穿上一件衬衫，否则会吓到那个可怜的男孩。"

She ducked into a loose yellow tee and put on a pair of blue shorts.  
她迅速套上一件宽松的黄色 T 恤，并穿上一条蓝色短裤。

Asuka flopped down onto her bed. Her stomach ached with two kinds of hunger. She rolled over and stared up at the ceiling. The fluorescent fixture above her bed threw light without warmth. Asuka stared into it until her vision became a milky blur, then she draped an arm over her eyes.  
明日香扑通一声倒在床上。她的胃里翻腾着两种饥饿感。她翻身仰望天花板，床上方那盏荧光灯投下冷冷的光。明日香凝视着它，直到视线变得模糊不清，随后她用手臂遮住了眼睛。

"Shinji," she rehearsed in a whisper. His name—too well-suited to say with a sneer—she practiced over and over until it slipped out like a sigh.  
"真嗣，" 她低声练习着。他的名字——太适合带着嘲讽说出口了——她一遍又一遍地练习，直到它像叹息一样自然滑出。

"Shinji, I know that we barely know each other, but it feels like we have always known each other."  
"真嗣，我知道我们几乎不认识对方，但感觉我们好像一直都很熟悉。"

_That's so lame_, she thought.  
真是太逊了，她想。

"Shinji, I know that we barely know each other, but it feels like we understand each other better than anybody."  
"真嗣，我知道我们几乎不认识对方，但感觉我们比任何人都更了解彼此。"

_Yeah, that's better. 嗯，这样好多了。_

"I've never been able to talk about my life like that. You made it so easy. I..."  
"我从未能那样谈论我的生活。你让它变得如此简单。我……"

_I love you. 我爱你。_

"I think I love you."  
我想我爱上你了。

_Damn it. 该死。_

"Do you think you could love me, too?"  
"你认为你也会爱上我吗？"

Asuka took a deep breath. The air tasted like a fresh meal. She got up, bleary-eyed, and stumbled out of her room. She was starving.  
明日香深吸了一口气，空气里弥漫着新鲜食物的味道。她睡眼惺忪地起身，踉跄着走出房间，感到饥肠辘辘。

Shinji spun around when he heard Asuka approach. He wore Misato's immaculate green apron, still creased from its long rest tucked away in a drawer. He nodded to her shyly, then turned away to serve.  
听到明日香的脚步声，真嗣转过身来。他穿着美里那件整洁的绿色围裙，围裙上还留有长时间藏在抽屉里未曾使用的折痕。他羞涩地向她点了点头，随即转身继续忙碌。

"Kawaii. That's probably the first time somebody's worn that."  
"卡哇伊。这可能是第一次有人穿那个。"

"Sorry, I hope you like it," Shinji said, gesturing to the food to deflect attention from himself. "There, uh, wasn't much to work with."  
"抱歉，希望你喜欢，" 真嗣说道，指着食物以转移对自己的注意。"那里，呃，没什么可用的。"

Asuka dropped into her seat.  
明日香一屁股坐进她的座位。

"I'm not surprised," she said, feeling embarrassed at her and Misato's living situation. Her stomach growled as if to chide her.  
"我并不感到惊讶，"她说道，对自己和美里同居的情况感到尴尬。她的肚子咕咕作响，仿佛在责备她。

"Well maybe Miss Katsuragi will take me shopping with her sometime? Or I could do the shopping myself."  
"或许有一天葛城小姐会带我去购物？或者我自己也可以去买东西。"

"If you took over groceries, she'd probably marry you, instead. Hah! Are you seriously blushing right now?!"  
"如果你接管了买菜的事，她可能真的会嫁给你，哈哈！你现在真的脸红了吗？！"

Shinji laid out the food and took off the apron. Asuka noticed that he himself had changed into something more casual. She smiled a secret smile to herself.  
真嗣摆好食物，脱下围裙。明日香注意到他自己也换上了更休闲的装束。她暗自微笑。

"Look at you, already making yourself at home. With me."  
看看你，已经在这里自得其乐了。和我一起。

Shinji nearly fumbled the serving platter. There was rice and some kind of meat and vegetable in a sauce. Asuka gulped, hoping the meat was still fresh. Shinji described all the ways he improvised to make the food, mostly looking at the serving dishes or down at his own in between quick glances at her. Asuka only looked at him. She felt her cheeks flushing but didn't care. The food was delicious. She dreaded dessert.  
真嗣差点没拿稳托盘。盘里有米饭和某种肉菜，搭配着酱汁。明日香咽了口口水，希望那肉还是新鲜的。真嗣描述了他如何即兴制作这些食物，大部分时间都看着餐盘或低头看着自己的手，偶尔快速瞥她一眼。明日香只看着他。她感到脸颊发烫，但并不在意。食物美味极了。她对甜点感到害怕。

Asuka finished first since Shinji talked so much. He hardly gave himself time to eat. She made a point to consume the final morsel on her plate with one big lick. She beamed at Shinji, who smiled and nodded back. Before his own chopsticks hit his empty plate, Asuka was already up and out of her seat to collect their dirty dishes.  
由于真嗣说了太多话，明日香先吃完了。他几乎没给自己留吃饭的时间。她特意用一大口舔干净了盘子里的最后一口食物。她对着真嗣灿烂一笑，真嗣也微笑着点头回应。他的筷子还没碰到空盘子，明日香已经起身去收拾他们的脏盘子了。

"We can save the rest for lunch tomorrow. I'll pack it up," Shinji said, starting to get up.  
“剩下的我们可以留到明天中午吃。我来打包，”真嗣说着，开始站起来。

"Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute, though?" Asuka said, dumping the dishes in the sink.  
“嗯，嗯。不过，等一下？”明日香说着，把盘子倒进了水槽。

She sat in the chair next to Shinji's. Her heart was pounding.  
她坐在紧邻真嗣的椅子上，心跳如鼓。

"Hey, Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

Shinji turned towards her. He quickly glanced down, then back up to her face. She realized he might have noticed her hands were shaking so she gripped her knees.  
真嗣转向她，迅速瞥了一眼，又抬头看向她的脸。她意识到他可能注意到了她的手在颤抖，于是她紧紧抓住了自己的膝盖。

"Yes?" “怎么了？”

Asuka took a deep breath.  
明日香深吸了一口气。

"Shinji, do you want to watch TV?"  
“真嗣，你想看电视吗？”

Several hours later, Asuka was back in her bedroom and alone with her thoughts. They had watched TV, washed the dishes, and parted for the night without her ever mustering the courage to say what had to be said. She felt as though a train was barreling towards her but it never came. She'd have to jump in front of it first.  
几小时后，明日香回到了自己的卧室，独自面对自己的思绪。他们看了电视，洗了碗，然后各自回房，她始终没有鼓起勇气说出必须说的话。她感觉就像一辆火车正朝她冲来，却始终没有到来。她必须先跳到它前面去。

Asuka held her breath and listened. There wasn't a sound in the apartment aside from her heartbeat.  
明日香屏住呼吸，侧耳倾听。公寓里除了她的心跳声，别无他响。

"No snoring. Good. Would have been a deal-breaker."  
没有鼾声。太好了。否则这可是个大问题。

She hopped out of bed and made her way through the silver darkness towards her door. Not carefully enough since she tripped and fell over the clothes she had shed earlier. Stifling a curse, she held her breath again and listened. Stillness. Silence.  
她从床上跳下，在银色的昏暗中向门口走去。不够小心，因为她绊倒在之前脱下的衣服上，摔了一跤。她忍住咒骂，再次屏住呼吸，倾听。依旧是一片寂静。

_I'm afraid to make a sound but I'm about to go wake him up. Are you stupid, Asuka?  
我害怕发出声音，但我正要去叫醒他。你是傻吗，明日香？_

She got up and kicked the tangled clothes into a dark corner then marched out into the hall.  
她起身将纠缠的衣物踢进暗角，然后大步走出房间进入走廊。

"Shinji? You awake? Shinji? I'm coming in."  
“真嗣？你醒了吗？真嗣？我要进来了。”

She slid his door open a crack. A thin rail of light from the hall illuminated Shinji in bed. His back was to her.  
她轻轻推开他的房门，露出一道缝隙。走廊的微弱光线照亮了床上的真嗣，他背对着她。

"Hey Shinji?" “真嗣？”

Shinji stirred. 真嗣动了动。

"Asuka? Is everything alright?"  
"Asuka? 一切都还好吗？"

"Well... Shinji, can I come in? Please?"  
"嗯... 真嗣，我能进来吗？拜托了？"

"Okay," he said, rolling over to face her.  
"好的，" 他说着，翻身面向她。

Asuka crossed the threshold and sat at the foot of his bed. Shinji propped himself up on his elbow. He blinked.  
明日香跨过门槛，坐在他的床脚。真嗣用手肘撑起身体，眨了眨眼。

She inhaled a big breath.  
她深吸了一口气。

"Shinji, I know that, um, that we barely—"  
“真嗣，我知道，嗯，我们几乎——”

"Wait! Stop, please," Shinji said. He drew himself up into a sitting position. "I heard you."  
"等等！请停下，" 真嗣说道。他坐直了身子。"我听到了。"

Starbursts erupted across Asuka's vision. Her heart tumbled into her gut. He had changed clothes before dinner, she realized, which meant he had gone into his new room. The room just across the hall from hers.  
星爆在明日香的视野中绽放。她的心沉到了胃里。她意识到，他在晚餐前换了衣服，这意味着他进入了他的新房间。那个就在她对面的房间。

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to listen! But you said my name! I thought you were talking to me, at least at first!"  
"对不起，我不是故意要听的！但你提到了我的名字！我以为你在跟我说话，至少一开始是这么认为的！"

"You idiot," Asuka said to herself. "So you heard everything?"  
"你这个笨蛋，" 明日香自言自语道，"所以你都听到了？"

"I think so." "我想是的。"

Asuka nearly cracked. She twisted her face tight to keep it all in.  
明日香几乎崩溃了。她紧绷着脸，努力把所有情绪都压抑住。

"Okay. You heard. So how do you feel about what you heard?"  
"好的。你听到了。那么，你对你所听到的有什么感受？"

Shinji hugged himself into a ball. He may as well have dove into the sea and swam for another continent. His body language said everything she was about to hear.  
真嗣将自己紧紧抱成一团。他仿佛跳入了大海，游向另一个大陆。他的肢体语言已经说明了她即将听到的一切。

"To tell you the truth, I worry for you. I don't think we have as much in common as you think. I mean, we do. We have Miss Katsuragi and Mr. Kaji. And we're both orphans. But, well, I'm sorry, but there's some hurt in the past that I've left behind. It's hard, I'm still working at it, but I'm doing my best to move beyond it."  
"说实话，我为你担心。我觉得我们之间并没有你想象的那么多共同点。我的意思是，我们确实有，比如葛城小姐和加持先生。而且我们都是孤儿。但是，对不起，我过去的某些伤痛我已经放下了。这很难，我仍在努力，但我正尽我所能去超越它。"

Asuka clenched and released her fists. She wanted to pound on Shinji's face to show him how it really felt to be hurt, even though her pain lay in a place so deep no one could ever reach it from the surface.  
明日香紧握又松开拳头。她想朝真嗣的脸猛击，让他体会真正受伤的感觉，尽管她的痛苦深藏于心，无人能从表面触及。

"And I'm not saying that whatever you feel, what you're struggling with, that it's not hard for you. That you should just get over it. I'm not saying that at all. But it's not good for me to talk about what happened to our parents when I'm trying to put that into the past."  
我不是说你感受到的，你所挣扎的，对你来说不艰难。不是说你应该轻易克服。我绝不是这个意思。但当我试图将父母的事情抛诸脑后时，谈论这些对我并不好。

"I don't know if Miss Katsuragi and Mr. Kaji getting married makes us brother and sister. We don't have to call each other that. I'd so much like for us to become friends, though, Asuka. I can tell you're in pain because I was in pain. I want to help you. There's just stuff I can't help you with myself."  
我不知道葛城小姐和加持先生结婚是否就让我们成了兄妹。我们不必那样称呼彼此。但我真的很希望我们能成为朋友，明日香。我能感觉到你在痛苦，因为我曾经也痛苦过。我想帮助你。只是有些事情我自己也帮不上忙。

Asuka held her face in her hands and let the tears flow. He made it so easy to betray herself.  
明日香双手捂脸，任由泪水流淌。他让她背叛自己变得如此容易。

"To answer your question, though, we're about to become family, Asuka. I'll love you and Miss Katsuragi just as much as Mr. Kaji."  
不过，回答你的问题，我们即将成为一家人，明日香。我会像卡吉先生一样爱你和葛城小姐。

"You know that's not what I meant," Asuka hissed through her hands. Shinji had no response.  
"你知道我不是那个意思，"明日香双手捂着脸，咬牙切齿地说。真嗣无言以对。

"So was that enough?" Asuka said to nobody in particular. "Is my humiliation over?" She looked up at the ceiling expecting it to come tumbling down.  
"这样够了吗？" 明日香对着空气说道，"我的羞辱结束了吗？" 她抬头望向天花板，仿佛期待它随时会崩塌下来。

Shinji cocked his head to the side.  
真嗣侧了侧头。

"Please don't feel embarrassed, I won't tell."  
"请别觉得尴尬，我不会说出去的。"

"I wasn't talking to you, you idiot!"  
"我不是在跟你说话，你这个白痴！"

Asuka ran back to her room and slammed the door.  
明日香跑回自己的房间，砰的一声关上了门。

When Asuka woke up, it was a fine summer day for a wedding. The ceremony went without a hitch. Asuka was shocked to see how sharp Mr. Kaji looked with a fresh shave and an unwrinkled shirt. She was also shocked at how low the neckline was on Misato's gown.  
当明日香醒来时，是一个适合婚礼的美好夏日。仪式顺利进行，没有出现任何差错。明日香惊讶地看到，剃了胡子、穿着平整衬衫的葛城先生看起来多么精神。她同样惊讶于美里礼服的领口有多低。

The newlyweds danced their first dance while all the guests gawked. Asuka used the opportunity to slip away from Shinji, his new girlfriend from a different class, and the rest of the wedding party gathered around the dance floor. She spotted a familiar blonde lady with an empty seat beside her.  
新婚夫妇跳起了他们的第一支舞，所有宾客都目不转睛地看着。借着这个机会，明日香悄悄地从真嗣、他来自不同班级的新女友以及婚礼的其他宾客中溜走，他们正围着舞池聚集。她注意到一位熟悉的金发女士旁边有个空位。

"Anybody sitting here?" Asuka asked, flopping into the seat without waiting for an answer.  
“这里有人坐吗？”明日香问道，没等回答就一屁股坐了下来。

"Asuka? I work with Misato. Well, we're friends. We've met, don't you remember? It's Ritsuko Akagi."  
“明日香？我和美里一起工作。嗯，我们是朋友。我们见过，你不记得了吗？我是赤木律子。”

"Cool." “酷。”

"Want to talk?" “想聊聊吗？”

"No."

"Then I'll talk." “那我就说说了。”

"Can't you go sit somewhere else?"  
"你不能去别的地方坐吗？"

"You're clearly eyeing her new ward and look like you need a distraction. We call you her 'ward' at work, too. Whenever somebody refers to you as Misato's daughter, she protests."  
"你显然在盯着她的新养子看，看起来你需要分散一下注意力。我们在工作中也称你为她的'养子'。每当有人把你称为碇真嗣的女儿时，她都会抗议。"

"Thanks, that makes me feel super."  
"谢谢，这让我感觉超棒。"

"Ah, it's not like that. She feels like she doesn't deserve the honor of being called your mother. At first we thought it was a clumsy expression of humility, but at this point some people worry. I don't. She told me not to, so I don't."  
"啊，不是那样的。她觉得自己不配被称为你的母亲。起初我们以为这是一种笨拙的谦逊表达，但现在有些人开始担心了。我不担心。她告诉我不要担心，所以我就不担心。"

"Misato should make better friends."  
"碇真嗣应该交些更好的朋友。"

Ritsuko seemed on edge even though they were far from the commotion and energy on the dance floor. Asuka's intuition tingled.  
尽管远离舞池的喧嚣与活力，律子似乎仍显得心神不宁。明日香的直觉开始作祟。

"Do you smoke?" “你抽烟吗？”

"Hmm?" Ritsuko snorted. She sniffed at herself and shrugged. "How could you tell?"  
“嗯？”律子嗤笑一声，她闻了闻自己，耸了耸肩。“你怎么知道的？”

"You want to go smoke?"  
"你想去抽烟吗？"

"Do you smoke?" "你抽烟吗？"

"No, but I've been meaning to take it up."  
"不抽，但我一直想试试。"

Asuka and Ritsuko rounded a corner of the function hall so they could have some privacy from the other smokers by the entrance. Ritsuko lit a cigarette and handed it to Asuka, then lit another and took a deep drag.  
明日香和律子绕过宴会厅的一个拐角，以便远离入口处其他吸烟者，享受一些私人空间。律子点燃一支烟递给明日香，然后又点燃一支，深深吸了一口。

"My girlfriend just broke up with me. She told me that she needed me and I called her a liar. I made her cry. She looked so pathetic that I had to leave for a while and when I came back she broke up with me."  
我的女朋友刚刚和我分手了。她告诉我她需要我，而我却骂她是骗子。我让她哭了。她看起来那么可怜，我不得不离开一会儿，当我回来时，她和我分手了。

Asuka burst out laughing.  
明日香突然大笑起来。

"Damn. That's cold, lady."  
"该死，你真冷酷。"

"She was lying! Nobody needs me. If I walked out of NERV tomorrow, nothing would change. They could continue on as though I were never there. I'm too good at writing documentation, you see. I'm told the secret is to make yourself indispensable, otherwise you're disposable."  
"她在撒谎！没人需要我。如果我明天离开 NERV，一切都不会改变。他们可以继续下去，就像我从未存在过一样。你知道吗，我太擅长写文档了。我听说秘诀是让自己不可或缺，否则你就是可有可无的。"

Asuka glanced over to Ritsuko only to catch her looking back.  
明日香瞥了一眼律子，却正好与她的目光相遇。

"You going to smoke that?"  
"你要抽那个吗？"

Asuka looked at the strange burning thing in her hand.  
明日香看着手中那奇怪的燃烧物。

"I don't know how." "我不知道怎么抽。"

Ritsuko sighed. "Ok, first put it between your lips. Suck in just a little into your mouth but don't inhale! Oh no!"  
律子叹了口气。“好吧，首先把它放在嘴唇之间。轻轻吸入口中，但不要吸入！哦不！”

Asuka was already coughing and retching. She hurled the cigarette to the ground and smashed it under her heel.  
明日香已经开始咳嗽和干呕。她将香烟扔到地上，用脚跟狠狠踩碎。

"Alright, enough smoking lessons for one day."  
“好了，今天的抽烟课就到此为止。”

Ritsuko held out her phone to Asuka with the photo app open.  
律子将手机递给明日香，照片应用已经打开。

"This is my ex. Am I stupid or what?"  
“这是我的前女友。我是不是很傻？”

Asuka thumbed through a few images of a mousy woman with short, brown hair. She was clearly a few years younger than Ritsuko, but not too young. Asuka could tell because she had a pleasant aura to her in all the pictures. The world hadn't beaten her down yet. She was very cute. There was one picture of the two of them. Ritsuko wore an official-looking lab coat and her ex held a NERV mug.  
明日香翻看了几张照片，上面是一个棕色短发的瘦小女子。她显然比律子年轻几岁，但也不算太年轻。明日香能感觉到，她在所有照片中都散发着一种宜人的气息。世界还未将她击垮。她非常可爱。有一张照片是她们两人的合影。律子穿着正式的实验室外套，而她的前女友则拿着一个 NERV 的马克杯。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "You worked with her, too? You really are stupid."  
明日香翻了个白眼。“你也跟她合作过？你真是够蠢的。”

Ritsuko chuckled. 律子轻笑了一声。

"You live with him, don't you?" she said, indicating the hall with her cigarette. "Talk about awkward."  
“你和他住一起，不是吗？”她用烟头指了指走廊，“想想都尴尬。”

Asuka gritted her teeth. 明日香咬紧牙关。

"Who are you, the NERV therapist?"  
“你是谁，NERV 的心理医生吗？”

"What's awkward is that I did need her," Ritsuko said. She blew some smoke away from Asuka. "Desperately, in fact. But I still behaved so irrationally around her, like she threatened me."  
“尴尬的是，我确实需要她，”律子说。她将烟雾从明日香身边吹散。“实际上，非常迫切。但我仍然在她周围表现得如此不理智，好像她威胁到了我。”

Asuka recalled the mousy girl with the earnest eyes.  
明日香回忆起那个眼神真挚的胆小女孩。

"She threatened you?" “她威胁你了？”

"Sure. It put me on the defensive. Fight or flight, an atavistic reaction. Have you ever heard of the Hedgehog's Dilemma?"  
“当然。这让我处于防御状态。战斗或逃跑，一种本能反应。你听说过‘刺猬困境’吗？”

"What's that? Sounds like a cartoon for babies," Asuka was impatient with all Ritsuko's meandering. She crossed her arms to make her displeasure known. "How'd she threaten you?"  
"那是什么？听起来像是给婴儿看的卡通片，" 明日香对律子所有的兜圈子感到不耐烦。她交叉双臂，以示不满。"她是怎么威胁你的？"

"By being essential, of course. I made an empirical observation: I needed her because when she wasn't there it destroyed me. It's a lot of power to cede to somebody. I held on to the self-destruct code, though. Look at us. Two strong women talking about their lost loves."  
"当然是通过变得不可或缺。我做了一个实证观察：我需要她，因为当她不在时，我崩溃了。把这么大的权力交给别人，真是太多了。不过，我保留了自毁代码。看看我们，两个坚强的女人在谈论她们失去的爱。"

Ritsuko pulled another drag from the cigarette and ashed it.  
律子又吸了一口烟，并弹了弹烟灰。

"Here's a hypothetical, instead: What would you do if, say, you were trapped and somebody else was in control of your air supply? Would you try to escape? Would you beg?"  
"假设这样一种情况：如果你被困住了，而有人控制着你的空气供应，你会怎么办？你会尝试逃跑吗？还是会乞求？"

White rage blinded Asuka.  
白怒使明日香目眩。

"I'd hold my breath," she muttered.  
"我会屏住呼吸，"她低声说道。

"So you do understand. Irrational behavior, in my opinion, though I'm not that kind of doctor. I made my role in her life very clear to her, but I obfuscated what part she played in mine. I thought that would make me indispensable. I think it made me vexing to be around."  
"看来你确实明白了。在我看来，这种行为是非理性的，尽管我不是那种医生。我向她明确了我在这段关系中的角色，却模糊了她在我生活中的位置。我以为这会让我变得不可或缺。我想这反而让我变得难以相处。"

"Did your cats take her side?"  
"你的猫们站在她那边了吗？"

Ritsuko tittered, but she did brush away a gray cat hair from her dark blue dress.  
律子轻笑一声，但还是从她深蓝色的裙子上拂去了一根灰色的猫毛。

"Well I'm not like you," said Asuka. "I told him. I made it very clear. What idiot hasn't heard about what happened to the Walls of Jericho? Should I have said the Maginot Line, instead? That'd be slutty!"  
"嗯，我可不像你，”明日香说，“我告诉他了，说得很清楚。哪个傻瓜没听说过耶利哥城墙的下场？我是不是该说马奇诺防线，那样会不会显得太轻浮了！”

"Hmm, yes, slutty," Ritsuko agreed.  
"嗯，是的，轻浮，”律子赞同道。

"And you know what he did?"  
"你知道他做了什么吗？"

"Blew his horn, no doubt."  
"肯定吹响了他的号角。"

Asuka flushed crimson. 明日香满脸通红。

"No! He did nothing! Nothing."  
"不！他什么也没做！什么也没做。"

Asuka held herself taut for as long as she was able, then let herself collapse. Ritsuko puffed to her side.  
明日香尽力保持紧绷，直到无法支撑，才让自己瘫倒。律子气喘吁吁地来到她身边。

"At work, I program all kinds of earthquake models to accurately predict how a structure will respond to different scenarios. You'd be easy to model: a seamless concrete cube, about yea high, filled solid. I could throw a Third Kanto at you and predict zero casualties, but that's because you don't let anybody inside."  
工作中，我编写各种地震模型，以精确预测结构在不同情况下的反应。你很容易建模：一个无缝的混凝土立方体，大约这么高，内部填实。我可以模拟一场关东大地震，预测零伤亡，但这只是因为你从不让人进入。

She took another drag. 她又吸了一口烟。

"Have you ever seen those videos of dogs who won't walk through an open glass door? They stand there begging to be let inside until their owner steps over the threshold themselves? So cute."  
"你见过那些视频吗？狗狗面对敞开的玻璃门就是不肯走过去，站在那里乞求主人放它进去，直到主人自己跨过门槛。真是太可爱了。"

"Doctor Animal Fetishist, you might have a point. I should have kept the idiot on a leash. And neutered him."  
"动物恋博士，你或许说得对。我本该把那个蠢货拴上绳子，还应该给它绝育。"

Ritsuko flicked her spent cigarette into an uncertain oblivion. Asuka could no longer hear the boisterous party inside.  
律子将燃尽的烟头弹向未知的虚空。明日香再也听不到屋内喧闹的派对声了。

"If you do depend on somebody, you should let him know. Test him all you want, but reach out just enough so he knows it's not a trick."  
"如果你真的依赖某人，就应该让他知道。你可以尽情考验他，但也要适当地伸出援手，让他明白这不是一个圈套。"

"Depend on somebody like you do on nicotine?"  
"依赖某人，就像你对尼古丁的依赖一样吗？"

"An imperfect analogy. Cigarettes don't keep me in their purse. Make yourself the first one he seeks, not the last. Do you want him to feel relieved when you're not around? Be indispensable."  
"这是个不完美的比喻。香烟不会把我藏在它们的包里。让自己成为他首先寻求的人，而不是最后一个。你希望他当你不在时感到宽慰吗？要让自己变得不可或缺。"

A chilly tightness tugged in Asuka's chest.  
一股寒意紧紧地拽住了明日香的胸口。

A memory from his mind echoed into hers: "I'm scared of both Misato and Ayanami... Help me, help me, Asuka... Come on, wake up... Call me an idiot like usual!"  
他脑海中的记忆回响在她的心中：“我害怕美里和绫波……帮帮我，帮帮我，明日香……快点，醒醒……像往常一样叫我白痴吧！”

"What if he did something bad?"  
“万一他做了什么坏事呢？”

"Who? That nice boy inside?" Ritsuko said, gesturing to where the function hall had been. It had been consumed by an expanding whiteness as well.  
"谁？里面那个好男孩吗？" 律子说着，指向原本是大厅的地方。那里也被一片扩张的白色吞噬了。

"You know who I mean. You know which one this is about."  
"你知道我指的是谁。你知道这是关于谁的。"

Ritsuko looked away. Earth and sky had lost distinction to an all-encompassing pale glow. A cold wind blew out of the north. Asuka hugged herself to stay warm. Ritsuko wasn't affected.  
律子转过头去。天地间的界限已被一片无所不包的苍白光芒所模糊。一阵寒风从北方吹来。明日香抱紧自己取暖。而律子却不受影响。

"That's right, you wouldn't remember winters," she observed.  
"没错，你不会记得冬天，" 她评论道。

"I know what a 'winter' was, I'm not stupid."  
"我知道什么是'冬天'，我可不傻。"

"Knowledge can be a poor substitute for experience, in my experience," said Ritsuko. "So back to my point: Don't forgive him. I've never forgiven anybody for anything in my life and look how far I've come. Immortality and with somebody who loved me all along. And I never would have let her in otherwise. Is she your plus one?"  
"以我的经验来看，知识有时是经验的不良替代品，" 丽津子说。"回到我的观点：不要原谅他。我一生中从未原谅过任何人，看看我走到了哪里。永生，还有一直爱我的人相伴。否则我永远不会让她进入我的生活。她是你的同伴吗？"

Ritsuko pointed to a figure in the distance. Asuka squinted.  
律子指向远处的一个人影。明日香眯起了眼睛。

"You wore a school uniform to a wedding? You're embarrassing, Ayanami."  
你穿校服来参加婚礼？真丢人，绫波。

Asuka stepped forward. Her foot fell with a cold crunch. She looked back to see the final guest had disappeared. She looked down and saw her toes were covered in snow.  
明日香向前迈步，脚下发出冰冷的碎裂声。她回头一看，最后一位宾客已经不见了。她低头一看，发现自己的脚趾上覆盖着雪。

"And you're late." "你迟到了。"

"I do not choose when to come."  
"我无法选择何时到来。"

Asuka jabbed a finger at Rei. "Why is it that when you and the idiot play god, you get everything you want? But when I try it out for myself, all I get is punishment?"  
明日香用手指戳了戳绫波。“为什么你和那个笨蛋玩弄神明时，总能如愿以偿？而我一试，得到的却只有惩罚？”

"The human soul abhors a vacuum, thus Complementation within Instrumentality. Here you can leave aside all pretense though not your truly held desires."  
"人的灵魂厌恶真空，因此在人类补完计划中寻求互补。在这里，你可以抛开所有伪装，但不是你真正持有的欲望。"

"I didn't want to get stuck here with that limp imitation that shared his name."  
"我不想和那个名字相同、行动迟缓的仿制品一起被困在这里。"

"You are not honest with yourself. You would rather suffer defeat than be proven wrong. It is untenable."  
"你对自己不够诚实。你宁愿承受失败，也不愿被证明是错误的。这是不可持续的。"

Asuka pressed ahead into the wind. Rei, while facing Asuka, stayed always the same distance apart. Although Rei's voice pierced the wind, Asuka found that she had to shout to be heard.  
明日香迎风前行。面对着明日香的绫波，始终保持着相同的距离。尽管绫波的声音穿透了风，明日香发现她必须大声喊叫才能被听见。

"I'm never wrong, not about him! I proved it again: the Shinji I needed doesn't exist. I proved that I don't need him to live. Empirically!"  
我永远不会错，尤其是关于他！我又一次证明了：我需要的那个真嗣根本不存在。我证明了我不需要他也能活下去。这是实证的！

"You perceive defeat as a decision, but fallibility as fate. What is forgiveness? Is it to lose? Or is it to acknowledge error? Which would put forgiveness within your power?"  
你将失败视为一种选择，而将可错性视为命运。什么是宽恕？是认输吗？还是承认错误？哪一种能让宽恕成为你的力量？

Rei sang. Asuka recognized the melody from when she was young but not the English lyrics Rei used.  
绫波唱着歌。明日香能听出这是她年幼时熟悉的旋律，但绫波所用的英文歌词却让她感到陌生。

"I think as I please  
我随心所欲地思考  
And this gives me pleasure  
这让我感到愉悦  
My conscience decrees 我的良知命令  
This right I must treasure"  
这份权利我必须珍视

"Those aren't the words!"  
那些不是我要的话！

"Not the words of your mother."  
"并非你母亲的话语。"

Rei faded into nothing. Asuka trudged forward towards where she had been. Shapes separated out of the nothingness: the ground, trees, houses. The featureless white sky lost its brilliance. Gray cracks appeared from which jagged blackness bled in twitching, spreading rays. A shapeless shadow of a figure darted between the darkest gaps.  
零逐渐消失无踪。明日香拖着沉重的步伐，向她曾经所在的地方走去。地面、树木、房屋，这些形状从虚无中分离出来。无特征的白色天空失去了它的光辉，灰色的裂缝中，锯齿状的黑暗如抽搐般蔓延开来，形成辐射状。一个无形的阴影在最深的裂缝间穿梭。

It whispered to Asuka a memory in her own voice: "I don't even want kids!"  
它用明日香自己的声音向她低语，唤起一段记忆："我甚至不想要孩子！"

"Go away!" "滚开！"

Black spread across the white until only pinpoints of brilliance showed through. The stars had come out. There was nowhere left in the heavens for Balthazar's ghost to hide so it left her alone. Asuka stepped into the crunching cold winter's night.  
黑色蔓延至白色之上，直至只剩下点点璀璨透出。星星出来了。天空中已无处供巴尔萨泽的幽灵藏身，于是它离开了她。明日香踏入了嘎吱作响的寒冷冬夜。
