### Chapter 1
"_I Like You, A"_ “我喜欢你，A”

_That's where it all started, with that single, incomplete message.  
一切都是从那条不完整的消息开始的。_

"What the heck does this mean?"  
“这到底是什么意思啊？”

The moment I read that unfinished message, a lot of things have changed especially with the way I behave and towards him. He could've finished that thing then I wouldn't be bothered by it. But wait... Do I really have to be bothered anyway! Hmp. He's probably playing dirty tricks on me. He knows that I was going to borrow that book that's why he intentionally wrote that damn message! Cheap move. That -  
当我读到那条未完成的消息时，很多事情都变了，尤其是我对他的态度和行为。他本可以完成那条消息，那样我就不会被它困扰了。但是等等...我真的有必要被困扰吗！哼。他可能是在对我耍花招。他知道我要借那本书，所以故意写了那条该死的消息！真卑鄙。那——

"Asuka. Dinner's ready!" "明日香。晚饭好了！"

Speaking of the devil. 说曹操，曹操到。

"Shut up!" "闭嘴！"

He better stop playing games.  
他最好别再玩游戏了。

"What did I do now?"  
“我这次又做了什么？”

Is that a murmur? Hmp. I made my way through the dark hallway without that message leaving my head until I reached the kitchen and couldn't believe what I saw. The freak is here. Oh goodness, why didn't i realize that Ayanami starts with "A". Yeah, yeah, there she was, sitting in front of our dining table, looking intently at the idiot's back while he's fixing something on the sink. Wondergirl is madly in-love with his scrawny back, amazing. I let out a heavy sigh before I sat across her. That's when she shifted her gaze to look at me.  
那是低语声吗？哼。我在黑暗的走廊中穿行，那句话一直萦绕在脑海，直到我走进厨房，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。那个怪人来了。天哪，我怎么没意识到绫波零的名字是以“A”开头的。没错，没错，她就坐在我们餐桌前，专注地盯着那个傻瓜在修理水槽的背影。这个迷妹对那瘦弱的背影爱得发狂，真是不可思议。我重重地叹了口气，然后坐在她对面。就在这时，她转移目光看向了我。

"The heck you're looking at?"  
"你到底在看什么鬼？"

It's not like I'm mad because her name also starts with A and contains 3 As while mine's just 2. By the way, do I really have to explain this to myself! Of course I didn't get any reply and before I could talk some more Shinji sat beside me.  
并不是因为我生气，她的名字也以 A 开头，有三个 A 而我的只有两个。顺便说一句，我真的需要向自己解释这个吗！当然我没有得到任何回复，而且在我还能多说几句之前，真嗣就坐在了我旁边。

"I forgot to tell you Asuka, Ayanami's going to stay with us for a while."  
"我忘了告诉你，明日香，绫波要和我们住一段时间。"

He's just on the middle of finishing that sentence, I could already feel the heat rising up to my head. My head hurts. Really! Why! It's the most ridiculous idea that I've ever heard since the day I was born! Maybe not. But still, that's absurd! I was sooo dismayed that I couldn't say anything, instead I hit the table with my precious head. Shinji's about to reach out, probably to check if I'm okay.  
他正说到一半，我已经能感觉到热度直冲头顶。我的头好痛。真的！为什么！这是我出生以来听过的最荒谬的主意！也许没那么夸张。但还是很离谱！我太沮丧了，以至于说不出话来，只好用我珍贵的头撞向桌子。真嗣正要伸手过来，大概是想看看我是否还好。

"Asuka? ..." “明日香？...”

But before he could touch me with his filthy hand, I stood up.  
但在他那肮脏的手碰到我之前，我站了起来。

"Unbelievable..." "难以置信..."

The only thing I said before I fell on my bed.  
这是我倒在床上前说的唯一一句话。

I'm about to go to sleep when something caught my attention. The book and its crappy message. Damn.. Damn.. Damn!  
我正准备睡觉时，有什么东西引起了我的注意。那本书和它糟糕的信息。该死..该死..该死！

---

"I wonder what happened to Asuka."  
"我在想明日香怎么了。"

So he's concern after all. Gosh, what am I even doing in here eavesdropping on the other side of the kitchen wall? Great Asuka, do you really care if he likes her or not? She might really be "A" and the hell, as if.. I don't know. What's with this mixed emotions and crazy ideas running inside my head? Oh, she's saying something.  
所以他终究还是关心她的。天哪，我在这里偷听厨房墙另一边的对话到底在干什么？伟大的明日香，你真的在乎他是否喜欢她吗？她可能真的是“A”，但见鬼，好像...我不知道。这些复杂的情绪和疯狂的想法在我脑子里乱窜是怎么回事？哦，她在说些什么。

"I was only ordered to stay for a week, it looked like Soryu's not okay with it."  
"我只被命令待一周，看来索吕并不乐意。"

One freakin' week! That's pure torture. Being her co-pilot was something I'm definitely not fond of and now the worst had happened. This is a complete disaster.  
整整一周！这简直是折磨。当她的副驾驶我绝对不喜欢，现在最糟糕的情况发生了。这完全是一场灾难。

"I think she's just a little shocked, but it doesn't mean that she hates you or something. Hehe."  
“我觉得她只是有点震惊，但这并不意味着她讨厌你或者什么的。呵呵。”

Shinji! You're stating the opposite, you dummy!  
“真嗣！你这说的正好相反，你这个笨蛋！”

"Wait Ayanami, I'll just check on her and see if she's fine. After all what she did with her head looked painful."  
"等等，绫波，我去看看她是否还好。毕竟她刚才撞到头看起来很疼。"

Shit. I have to go back or he'll see me, he might get the wrong idea. Wait. Wondergirl is saying something again.  
该死。我得回去，不然他会看到我，可能会误会。等等。三无少女又在说什么了。

"You seem to care for her a lot, Ikari. You must be attracted to her emotionally."  
"你似乎很关心她，碇。你一定是被她情感上吸引了。"

The heck you're saying freakazoid!  
你到底在说什么鬼话，怪胎！

"I .. I .. Uhm .."  
"我...我...呃..."

Oh yeah, kinda expected that response.  
哦，是吗，有点预料到你会这么回答了。

"Ikari, I think I should sleep in your room because it seemed like Soryu would dislike the idea of me staying in hers."  
"碇，我觉得我应该睡在你的房间，因为明日香似乎不喜欢我住在她的房间里。"

WHAT! 什么！

"Waaa- Ayanami, I don't think that's -"  
"哇啊——绫波，我觉得那不太——"

Me not liking what I'm hearing.  
我不喜欢我听到的东西。

"What the hell wondergirl! You a perv or what!"  
“见鬼了，小仙女！你是个变态还是怎么的！”

Uh-oh. Now I'm certainly sure they're thinking where in the world did she came from.  
哎呀。现在我肯定他们在想，她到底是从哪儿冒出来的。

"I'm not eavesdropping! I just... Uhm..."  
"我不是在偷听！我只是...呃..."

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Shinji said with a puzzled look.  
真嗣带着困惑的表情说道。

"Damn..." "该死..."

The craziness just wouldn't stop. Who would've thought that I would drag this silly boy through the dark hallway of this apartment and inside the elevator? Great, huh? Then there was darkness.  
这疯狂就没个尽头。谁能想到我会拽着这个傻小子穿过这公寓的昏暗走廊，还进了电梯？真棒，对吧？然后就是一片漆黑。

"Crap. Blackout!" "糟糕。停电了！"

"Asuka…" “明日香…”

"Shut up! It is your fault that we're stuck in here!"  
“闭嘴！都是你的错，我们才会被困在这里！”

Well, oh well, it's obviously my fault but blurting out something like "It's my fault, I'm sorry." would be sooo not me! So yeah, because of certain things that my mind could not comprehend at the moment, I'm stuck with him in this dark and tiny elevator.  
哎呀，真是的，显然是我的错，但要是脱口而出“是我的错，对不起。”那就太不像我了！所以没错，因为当时我脑子一片混乱，无法理解某些事情，结果就被困在这又黑又小的电梯里和他一起。

"I'm sor- " "对不- "

"Aaaahhh! I don't wanna hear it Shinji."  
"啊啊啊！我不想听这个，真嗣。"

He's always like that. I'm sick of it. He's so typically good natured.  
他总是那样。我受够了。他真是典型的脾气好。

"I wonder how's Ayanami…"  
“不知道绫波现在怎么样了…”

He whispered though I clearly heard it.  
他低声说着，尽管我听得清清楚楚。

"And that's the second thing I hate to hear."  
"而这是我讨厌听到的第二件事。"

It's totally dark and that quite annoyed me. Silence filled the air for a short while before I decided to ask him something that's been filling my thoughts for quite some time.  
四周一片漆黑，这让我相当烦躁。空气中沉默了一会儿，我决定问他一个困扰我已久的问题。

"Shinji, about the book I borrowed from you.."  
"真嗣，关于我从你那儿借的那本书……"

"Hmm? It's good right?" “嗯？挺好的吧？”

Damn. What a way to cut someone who's speaking. I didn't even have a chance to read it because of that welcome note. *Sigh* I couldn't ask him. Why!  
该死。打断别人说话的方式真绝。就因为那条欢迎词，我都没机会读。*叹气* 都没法问他。为什么！

"Yeah…" “是啊……”

Is all I could say. Why am I holding back? If ever, would he tell me the truth? And, why am I so bothered by it? There was silence again.  
我只能这么说。为什么我要克制？如果有一天，他会告诉我真相吗？还有，为什么我对此如此困扰？又是一片沉默。

---

"Why did you do that Asuka?"  
“你为什么要那样做，明日香？”

We're still in the elevator.  
我们还在电梯里。

"You wanted to sleep with her so badly huh?"  
"你那么想和她睡吗？"

That question just came out of nowhere. Stupid Shinji. Even though it's unusual for me to do and say these kinds of stuff, still-  
这个问题突然冒出来，真是个笨蛋真嗣。虽然我平时不怎么会做这种事、说这种话，但还是——

"No! It's not like that…"  
"不是的！不是那样的……"

It's pretty dark in here which is a good thing, then I wouldn't be able to see his frickin' blushing face.  
这里挺暗的，挺好，这样我就看不见他那该死的脸红了。

"Tch! Just admit it, you like her!"  
啧！承认吧，你喜欢她！

Common. Common! 快点，快点！

"…"

Eh? 嗯？

"Hey!" 嘿！

What the.. 什么鬼...

"…"

No answer? What was that supposed to mean? Crap.  
没回答？这是什么意思？糟糕。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"I don't hate her." "我不讨厌她。"

"I know… I know. That's why you like her!"  
"我知道……我知道。所以你才喜欢她！"

"I…" "我…"

"Spit it out idiot!" "快说，笨蛋！"

"Why are you concerned Asuka?"  
"你为什么关心这个，明日香？"

"Well… Uhm… I…" "嗯…呃…我…"

Now, I have to spit it out.  
现在，我得说出来了。

*Pause* *停顿*

What should I spit out anyway?  
我到底该吐出些什么呢？

"It's just that.. What the hell! What's with your questions? Forget it!"  
“只是……搞什么鬼！你这些问的都是什么问题？算了！”

I don't know why but somehow I could feel the blood rushing up to my face. Maybe because it's getting hot in here. A few seconds later, I felt something touching my legs. I flinched for a second there. A hand? Yeah, a warm hand. It's Shinji's hand, no doubt.  
我不知道为什么，但不知怎么地我能感觉到血液涌上脸颊。也许是因为这里越来越热了。几秒钟后，我感觉到有什么东西触碰我的腿。我吓了一跳。是手吗？是的，一只温暖的手。毫无疑问，那是真嗣的手。

"What a perv, Ikari. Because Ayanami's not in here, you think that I would be a good replacement huh! Stop doing dirty stuffs on me."  
"真是个变态，碇。因为绫波不在这里，你就觉得我是不错的替代品，对吧！别再对我做这些肮脏的事了。"

I pushed his hand away and at the same time my vision started to adapt in the dark. There, I saw Shinji frozen in place with a shocked expression. No, he's more terrified.  
我推开他的手，同时我的视线开始适应黑暗。在那里，我看到真嗣僵在原地，脸上带着震惊的表情。不，他更多的是恐惧。

"Hey, are you okay? You going insane that Ayanami's not in here and you're stuck with me and you're thinking I'm not good enough and- "  
"嘿，你还好吗？是不是因为绫波不在这里，你和我被困在一起，觉得我不够好，所以你疯了——"

"A..Asuka…" "A..明日香…"

He said with a shaky voice as he slowly moved behind me and grabbed my shoulders lightly.  
他用颤抖的声音说着，缓缓移动到我身后，轻轻抓住了我的肩膀。

"Whoa.. Whoa.. Aren't we getting touchy right now?"  
"哇..哇..我们现在是不是太亲密了点？"

His grip became stronger and his hands are shaking as if he's afraid of something.  
他的握力变得更强了，双手颤抖着，仿佛害怕着什么。

"Sshhh.. Something.. No. Someone.. Touched my back."  
“嘘……有东西……不，有人……碰了我的背。”

Shinji muttered as I felt his breath lightly touched the back of my neck. My hair's tied up anyway and I know, it's not my typical hairstyle. Meh, just felt like it. Back to our situation. I don't know how to react to that but… Well… I haven't seen a ghost before. And! I don't have plans on seeing one. But if it's true, that there's a ghost with us… At the same time, this idiot must be playing cheap tricks again. When all of a sudden, I felt something strange leaving me stunned. My body felt heavy and was soon followed by a cold sensation. It made me shivered and I never had goosebumps like that before.  
真嗣低声说道，我感觉到他的呼吸轻轻拂过我的后颈。反正我的头发是扎起来的，我知道，这不是我平常的发型。唉，就是想这么弄。回到我们的情况。我不知道该如何反应，但是……嗯……我以前从未见过鬼。而且！我也不打算见鬼。但如果这是真的，有鬼和我们在一起……与此同时，这家伙肯定又在玩廉价把戏了。突然间，我感到一种奇怪的感觉让我愣住了。我的身体变得沉重，紧接着是一种冰冷的感觉。这让我打了个寒颤，我以前从未有过这样的鸡皮疙瘩。

"Hheeey..!" "嘿嘿嘿..！"

Am I shaking like him? I don't believe in ghosts in the first place!  
我也在发抖吗？我本来就不相信有鬼！

"*Ehem!* Stop joking Shinji… Hah! It's just the two of us in here. Quit hallucinating! Have you eaten enough dinner?"  
"*咳咳！* 别开玩笑了，真嗣……哈！这里只有我们两个人。别再幻觉了！你晚饭吃饱了吗？"

He then started to attack my waist as he surrounded his arms around it and tightly hugged me. That shocked the shit out of me dude! We never had such physical contacts before. No. Not this close. I never had with other guys as well, Kaji's not counted. Somehow, it felt… awkward.  
随后他开始攻击我的腰部，双臂环绕其上紧紧抱住我。这他妈的吓死我了，伙计！我们以前从未有过如此亲密的身体接触。不，不是这样的近距离。我和其他男生也没有过，除了加持不算。不知怎么的，感觉……很尴尬。

"Did you hear that Asuka? Someone's crying!"  
“你听到了吗，明日香？有人在哭！”

"You bastard! Let go! I don't hear a thing! What are you? A baby? There are no such things as ghosts!"  
“你这个混蛋！放开我！我什么都没听到！你是什么？婴儿吗？世界上根本没有鬼这种东西！”

I tired to remove his arms but he just tightened it even more.  
我试图移开他的手臂，但他却勒得更紧了。

"It hurts! Stop! Pervert! Pervert!"  
“疼死了！住手！变态！变态！”

I shouted at the top of my lungs as I pinched his ear, somehow his arms loosened so I managed to turn and face him.  
我扯着嗓子大喊，同时捏住他的耳朵，不知怎么的他的手臂松了些，我这才得以转身面对他。

"But I don't want to see a ghost."  
"但我不想要见到鬼。"

He whispered. Our faces just a few distance away from each other. We could feel each other's breath. Just staring at each other, eye to eye for several seconds, I was about to say something when I felt something cold touched my leg. How? Shinji's arms are still encircling my waist. WHO! Due to shock and realization, I did something weird and unexpected. I jumped into him, legs around his waist, arms surrounded his neck. Kind of an awkward position, I know.  
他低语道。我们的脸庞仅相隔几寸，能感受到彼此的呼吸。就这样凝视着对方，眼对眼，持续了好几秒，我正要开口说话时，突然感到有什么冰凉的东西触碰了我的腿。怎么回事？真嗣的手臂还环在我的腰间。那是谁！由于惊吓和意识到不对劲，我做出了一个奇怪且出乎意料的举动。我跳向他，双腿环绕在他的腰间，双臂搂住他的脖子。我知道这姿势有点尴尬。

"Ahhhh! Nooo! Go away! Leave us alone!"  
"啊啊啊！不要！走开！别来打扰我们！"

Okay, okay. It's my turn. Now, I sounded like a crazy bitch in some random horror movie.  
好了，好了。轮到我了。现在，我听起来像某个随机恐怖电影里的疯婆子。

"Asuka! Calm down!" “明日香！冷静点！”

"You're the one to talk to idiot!"  
“你才是那个该跟白痴说话的人！”

I glared at him, still not letting go.  
我瞪着他，依旧没有松手。

"Something cold! It touched my leg! Let's go out of here!"  
“什么冰冷的东西！碰到我的腿了！我们快离开这里！”

"I told you, there's really something, someone, with us…."  
“我告诉过你，真的有什么，或者什么人在我们身边……”

My arms around his neck tightened.  
我环在他脖子上的手臂收紧了。

"Shut up! Shut up!" “闭嘴！闭嘴！”

"Asu—ka.. Can't— breathe-.."  
“麻—衣香.. 无法—呼吸—..”

"I hate creepy things! That's why I dislike wondergirl right! What should we do?"  
"我讨厌吓人的东西！这就是我不喜欢神奇女孩的原因，对吧！我们该怎么办？"

"..."

**A/N:** Yey! Third chapter. How's this fic guys? The chapters are pretty short right? Well, I'm a beginner and I hate writing (reading too) large paragraphs.  
A/N: 耶！第三篇《1001》。这篇小说怎么样，伙计们？章节都很短对吧？嗯，我是个新手，不喜欢写（读也是）大段文字。

**AngelNo13Bardiel:** Yo ! Thanks for your review. It meant a lot. Hoping this fic turns out good. Haha. Take care!  
AngelNo13Bardiel: 哟！谢谢你的评论。这对我意义重大。希望这篇小说能写得好。哈哈。保重！

---
"Get us out of here! Right now! Now!"  
"带我们离开这里！马上！现在！"

Asuka Langley Soryu's gone ballistic. Great. Just great. Who knew I would be able to show him this side of me. Just because of the stupid book! That stupid message! My stupid thoughts! This stupid boy!  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷彻底爆发了。真是太好了。简直太好了。谁知道我会向他展示这一面。就因为那本愚蠢的书！那个愚蠢的信息！我愚蠢的想法！这个愚蠢的男孩！

"Wait.. Who's that? There's someone there…"  
"等等……那是谁？那里有人……"

Good job Shinji. 干得好，真嗣。

"What did you say? Grrr! I hate you! I hate you!"  
“你说什么？哼！我讨厌你！我讨厌你！”

While still in his arms, I started slapping him for several times.  
在他怀里，我开始连续扇他耳光。

"Stop Asuka! I might lose balance!"  
"住手，明日香！我可能会失去平衡！"

And yeah, he did. Well fell and switched to a more provocative position, that's me lying on top of him.  
没错，他确实摔倒了，还换成了一个更挑逗的姿势，我就这么压在他身上。

"Aww.." "哎呀.."

He said while rubbing he's back. That fall might hurt him a lot.  
他边说边揉着他的背。那一摔可能让他很疼。

"I'm.. Uh.. Hmp!" “我……呃……哼！”

We both stood up and moved to the corner of the elevator.  
我们俩都站了起来，移到电梯的角落。

"So what did you see?"  
“那你看到了什么？”

"Uhm.. Sorry Asuka, I was just joking, I didn't - "  
“呃……抱歉，明日香，我只是在开玩笑，我没有——”

No. Way. This isn't the right time for that! What is he thinking?  
不可能。现在不是时候！他在想什么？

"Shin..ji.." "真..嗣.."

I was about to punch him.  
我正准备揍他。

"But when you're scared… You're…"  
"但当你害怕的时候…你…"

I stopped halfway and he stopped talking. What? Another unfinished thingy, invincible Ikari? Oh. That rhymed. *Sigh* So, it's just a joke. All of it? Wait. I'm sure though that during that time I really felt that cold touch in my leg. That's way too much to be a fragment of my imagination. Damn.  
我停在了半途，他也停止了说话。什么？又一件未完成的事，无敌的碇君？哦。这押韵了。*叹气* 所以，这只是个玩笑。全部都是？等等。我确信在那段时间里我真的感到了腿上的那股寒意。那绝不可能只是我的想象。该死。

"I'm really sorry." “我真的很抱歉。”

He said softly. Before I could backfire the electricity came back. He pushed the button and the elevator finally opened. Outside, I saw the creepiest ghost ever.  
他轻声说道。我还没来得及反驳，电源就恢复了。他按下按钮，电梯终于打开了。外面，我看到了有史以来最吓人的鬼魂。

"Ikari-kun, are you ok?" "碇君，你还好吗？"

This girl ignores me quite a lot huh.  
这个女孩还真是经常无视我呢。

"Ayanami…" "绫波…"

He's about to exit the elevator but I pushed the button right away. He looked at me, bewildered.  
他正要走出电梯，但我立刻按下了按钮。他困惑地看着我。

"Asuka..?" “明日香……？”

A-yanami. A-suka. A-sshole Shinji. Hmmm..  
A-绫波。A-明日香。A-混蛋真嗣。嗯……

"We need to talk." "我们需要谈谈。"

The elevator then descended down the apartment complex. This is going to be a long night I suppose.  
电梯随后在公寓楼中下降。我想这将是一个漫长的夜晚。

---
### Chapter 2

Here we are, walking side by side. No one said anything since we left the apartment.  
我们并肩走着，自离开公寓后，谁也没有开口说话。

_We need to talk. 我们需要谈谈。_

Tch. Saying something like that Asuka. I don't have anything in particular to tell him anyway. He's also pretending not to know "that" thing written in the book. It would also be weird if I asked him again. This is getting a bit messed up.  
啧。像这样对明日香说。反正我也没什么特别要告诉他的。他也装作不知道书里写的那件事。如果我再问他，也会很奇怪。这事儿有点乱套了。

"Hey Asuka.."

Oh, at last wimpy-kun!  
哦，终于轮到胆小鬼了！

"What?-"

We stopped walking as I turned my head to where he's looking at. It's an abandoned building.  
我们停下脚步，我转头看向他注视的地方。那是一栋废弃的建筑。

"Hmm.. It's my first time seeing this building this close during night time. It indeed looks creepy just like what Hikari said."  
“嗯……这是我第一次在夜晚这么近距离地看到这栋建筑。确实如光所说，看起来很诡异。”

Ooohh. He seemed scared again but this building is kind of.. No. It's really scary. I'm so not into supernatural things.  
哦哦。他似乎又害怕了，但这栋建筑有点……不，真的很恐怖。我完全不相信超自然的东西。

"So, the class rep knows it too. Touji also told me stories about this building. He said that anyone who enters this building and eventually makes it out alive, his or her wish will be granted."  
"这么说，班长也知道了。阿透还给我讲过这栋楼的故事。他说，凡是进入这栋楼最后能活着出来的人，他的愿望都会被实现。"

This guy believes in every little stupid thing that people tell him.  
这家伙相信人们告诉他的每一件小事。

"Make it out alive! That doesn't sound inviting. Who would dare? No one knew what's inside so it's too risky. Don't tell me you wanted to try that out?"  
"活着出来！听起来可不怎么吸引人。谁敢啊？没人知道里面有什么，太冒险了。你该不会是想试试吧？"

He quickly shook his head. Good, because we just encountered something a while ago. Enough is enough. I grabbed his arm and dragged him away from that place.  
他迅速摇了摇头。好，因为我们刚才遇到了一些东西。够了就是够了。我抓住他的手臂，把他从那个地方拖走了。

"Let's go. It's not worth checking you know. We're pilots not ghost busters."  
“走吧。不值得检查，你知道的。我们是飞行员，不是捉鬼敢死队。”

As I looked back, I swear, something caught my eye. Is it a shadow alongside the building? It's dark, I couldn't see it clearly, which is why I am grateful. So, I just ignored it. Probably one of my imagination again.  
当我回头看时，我发誓，有什么东西吸引了我的注意。是建筑物旁的影子吗？天色太暗，我看不清，这让我很感激。所以，我只是忽略了它。可能又是我的想象罢了。

"A ramen stand? That's odd, haven't seen one before."  
"拉面摊？真奇怪，以前从没见过。"

Shinji said after I dropped his arm. Perfect! I'm so hungry. I lost my appetite because of Wondercreep. I hope Shinji brought some cash.  
我放开他的手臂后，真嗣说道。太好了！我饿坏了。因为那个怪人，我都没胃口了。希望真嗣带了些钱。

"Let's eat! I'm starving. Didn't have a chance to eat dinner."  
"我们吃吧！我快饿死了。晚饭都没机会吃。"

"Good thing I brought some money with me."  
"幸好我带了些钱。"

Yes! That statement lit up my gloomy face.  
太好了！那句话让我的阴沉脸色亮了起来。

---

"Good evening! What's your order? Wow. What a beauty, is she your woman?"  
"晚上好！您要点什么？哇，真是个美人，她是您的女人吗？"

Woman? What a big mouth. The guy in the ramen stand was a middle-aged man wearing a big smile on his face. I threw him a disgusted look before he could talk some more. Shit, stupid Shinji's smiling. I glared at him and he averted my gaze quickly. He then talked to him, stating our order.  
女人？真是大嘴巴。拉面摊的老板是个中年男子，脸上挂着大大的笑容。我厌恶地瞥了他一眼，他还没来得及多说些什么。该死，愚蠢的真嗣又在笑了。我瞪了他一眼，他迅速避开了我的目光。接着，他向老板点了我们的餐。

"Have you two heard the story?"  
“你们俩听说过那个故事吗？”

What now? I thought the disgusted look was more than enough to shut that big mouth. I ignored him and focused on eating my meal while this boy beside me looked interested as he shifted his attention and listened intently to him.  
又是什么事？我觉得我那厌恶的表情已经足够让他闭嘴了。我无视了他，专注于吃我的饭，而旁边的这个男孩似乎很感兴趣，他转移了注意力，专心地听他说。

"I bet you haven't heard of it because you're still out having a date. HEHEHE."  
"我打赌你没听说过，因为你还在外面约会呢。呵呵呵。"

I shot him a death glare.

"_Ahem!_ Well, there's this rumor that during this time of the night, a creepy lolita girl would appear in one of the street alleys and would haunt any man she sees. She's going to ask that man whether he have a little sister or not. If he says yes, the girl will kill the younger sister and eventually becomes his younger sister. If he doesn't have, the lolita girl will serve as the man's younger sister and will stay with him forever. So, you have no other choice. Whatever you say, she'll definitely bother you. Creepy huh?"  
"咳咳！嗯，有个传闻说，在这个时间段的夜晚，一个诡异的洛丽塔女孩会出现在某条街的巷子里，缠上她看到的任何男人。她会问那个男人是否有妹妹。如果他说有，女孩就会杀死那个妹妹，最终变成他的妹妹。如果他没有妹妹，洛丽塔女孩就会成为他的妹妹，永远和他在一起。所以，你别无选择。无论你怎么说，她肯定会缠着你。吓人吧？"

_Sigh_ Another shitty story, they're starting to gross me out.  
唉，又是些烂故事，开始让我觉得恶心了。

"Only—Only guys? Girls have younger sisters too!"  
"只有——只有男生吗？女生也有妹妹的！"

You're scaring little Shinji mister ramen guy.  
你吓到小真嗣了，拉面先生。

"I'm afraid that's right. Only guys."  
"恐怕是的。只有男生。"

Shinji's frozen figure was quite amusing.

"Haha! Common Shinji! That's absurd. There's no such thing as that! It's only a story, didn't he tell us? Juuuust a story."  
"哈哈！普通的真嗣！这太荒谬了。那种东西根本不存在！那只是个故事，他不是告诉过我们吗？仅仅是个故事。"

I patted his back real hard and he came back to his senses. He looked at me with a bothered expression.  
我用力拍了拍他的背，他这才回过神来。他带着困扰的表情看着我。

"You really are the wimpiest person I know in my entire life.."  
"你真的是我这辈子见过的最胆小的人了.."

"Sorry. Well, we should probably head back now. Misato might be already home and Ayanami's alone at the apartment. She might be wondering where we went at this hour."  
"对不起。嗯，我们可能现在该回去了。美里可能已经到家了，绫波一个人在公寓里。她可能会好奇我们这么晚去了哪里。"

So, he's worried sick with his psycho girlfriend. He paid for the food and headed back to the alley leading to our apartment. I followed right away. I was about to tell him that we still haven't talked about.. Well, certain things, however, something stopped me. Before us, at the middle of the alley, under a light post, a little girl holding a teddy bear was standing, as if waiting for us. Impossible. I searched for the ramen stand but..  
所以，他担心得要命，因为他的疯女友。他付了饭钱，然后朝通往我们公寓的小巷走去。我立刻跟了上去。我正想告诉他我们还没谈过……呃，某些事情，但有什么东西阻止了我。在我们面前，小巷中央，路灯下，一个小女孩抱着一只泰迪熊站在那里，仿佛在等我们。不可能。我寻找那家拉面摊，但是……

"HOW COME IT'S GONE?"  
"它怎么不见了？"

The eff's happening! 到底发生了什么鬼事！

"Asuka.. Going home.. Might be a bad idea after all."  
“明日香...回家...可能终究是个馊主意。”

Yeah. For once in my life, I agreed with him. The problem lies in the fact that the one standing right next to me, is a guy. I could only feel sorry for Shinji. _Sigh_  
“是啊。我这辈子头一次同意他的看法。问题在于，站在我身边的，是个男人。我只能为真嗣感到遗憾。唉。”

### Chapter 3

**A/N:** Hi everyone! I feel bloated all throughout the day. I skipped breakfast because I wanted to rest so badly, stressed from work, so I ended up eating in an eat-all-you-can restaurant during lunch, ~the food was epic. Pizza, Salad, Pasta, Soup.

**Donderkind:** Wow, thank you sooo much. Your review made my day. :D  
Donderkind: 哇，太感谢你了。你的评论让我一整天都开心极了。:D

"Where do you plan to take me now?"  
“你现在打算带我去哪儿？”

Because of that freaky Lolita rumour, we're like lost souls wandering the streets of Tokyo-3 during this hour. Thanks ramen guy, for that incredible tongue of yours.  
因为那个诡异的洛丽塔传闻，我们就像迷失的灵魂在这东京-3 的街头游荡。感谢那位拉面小哥，你的舌头真是不可思议。

"I don't have a clue. They're on a school trip, NERV's too far and Ayanami's house is being fixed at the moment."  
“我也没主意。他们在学校旅行，NERV 又太远，而绫波的家目前还在修缮中。”

The whole class went on another trip by the way and of course NERV left us out because who knows when a frickin' angel might attack. Hikari and the others might be having a great time by now.  
顺便说一句，整个班级又去旅行了，当然 NERV 把我们排除在外，因为谁知道什么时候会有该死的天使袭击。现在光和她的朋友们可能玩得很开心。

"No choice, might need to go and check if she's gone by now. We could head back in here if she's still there anyway."  
没办法，可能需要去看看她现在是否已经离开了。如果她还在那里，我们还是可以回到这里的。

He nodded but his face showed a lot of regret as we approach the dark alley once again. Thank God... She's gone. Shinji sighed in relief. That's before we heard someone... Not. Again.  
他点点头，但当我们再次接近那条黑暗的小巷时，他的脸上流露出许多遗憾。谢天谢地...她走了。真嗣松了一口气。就在我们听到某个声音之前...又不是。

"_Heeey...__Do__you__have__a__younger__sister?__Do__you__want__to__be__my__onii-chan?_"  
"_嘿...__你__有__个__妹妹__吗?_想__当__我__的__哥哥__吗？"

We both shrieked. I could barely move a muscle. Time stopped. Our little feet glued to the ground, neither of us moving an inch. To our disbelief the Lolita freak was standing closely behind us. Where and when did she-? For a brief moment, Ayanami appeared normal in my perspective. Both not daring to look back, we're just frozen in place for several seconds. My mouth's half-opened, I wanted to shout so badly, but not a word or even a faint sound came out. Shinji then snapped, carried me in his arms and dashed away. I came back to my senses and started screaming on the top of my lungs.  
我们同时尖叫起来。我几乎动弹不得。时间仿佛停止了。我们的小脚像被粘在地上，一动不动。难以置信的是，那个洛丽塔怪人就站在我们身后。她是什么时候从哪里冒出来的？有那么一瞬间，绫波在我眼中显得正常了。我们都不敢回头，只是僵在原地几秒钟。我的嘴半张着，很想大喊，但一个字甚至一声微弱的声响都没发出。真嗣突然回过神来，把我抱在怀里，飞奔而去。我回过神来，开始放声尖叫。

"AHHHHH! What the heeeell?"

I just have to let it all out you know or a heart disease might grow on me. We finally reached the apartment, rode the elevator and finally ended at the front door with Shinji, our great hero, still carrying me in his almighty arms, catching his breath. Bravo, at least he's quite handy at times like this. I'm impress he was able to run that fast while carrying my light as a feather body. The great fruit of our glorious trainings.  
我得把这一切都发泄出来，不然心脏病可能会找上我。我们终于到了公寓，乘电梯，最后到了前门，真嗣，我们的伟大英雄，还在他那无所不能的臂膀中抱着我，喘着气。太棒了，至少在这种时候他相当得力。我对他能抱着我这轻如鸿毛的身体跑得这么快感到印象深刻。这都归功于我们光荣的训练成果。

"We're home, I know that you longed for this moment but put me down already."  
"我们到家了，我知道你一直盼着这一刻，但快把我放下来吧。"

Crap! He's turned into a zombie!  
糟糕！他变成僵尸了！

"Hellooooo? Earth to Shinji Ikari!"  
"喂——？真嗣一花，你在听吗？"

His soul went back. Good for him.  
他的灵魂归位了。对他来说是好事。

"Whaa- Sorry!"

Keeps on apologizing, sorry this, sorry that. Just when he's about to put me down, the door flew open, revealing a whore. I kiiiiiid. It's Misato. She probably heard me screamed.  
不停地道歉，这个对不起，那个对不起。就在他要把我放下的时候，门突然开了，露出一个妓女。我开个玩笑。是美里。她大概是听到我尖叫了。

"Great, you're here! How's the date?"  
“太好了，你来了！约会怎么样？”

Why do people always assume that I'm dating this dude! Just because we're eating on a ramen stand in the middle of the night? And that upon entering our apartment, we have to do this bridal-style-carry-me-in-your-arms-and-be-proud thingy? It doesn't make sense. But we're both blushing, like hell, I'm blushing too? Really Asuka? Slap your face. Now. Nah, of course I can't.  
为什么人们总是认为我在和这家伙约会！就因为我们半夜在拉面摊吃东西？还有，一进我们公寓就得来个新娘抱式的‘把我抱在怀里并感到自豪’的戏码？这说不通。但我们俩都脸红了，见鬼，我也脸红了？真的，明日香？打自己一巴掌。现在。不，当然我不能。

"You have no effin' idea Misato..."  
“你根本不知道，美里……”

This woman is grinning like an idiot I want to beat her so badly. Author, what is this, you turning me into a sadist. Wait. For the break, I am a sadist. Oh, check out EVA manga's latest chapters, things are getting a bit steamy [GendoxRei shippers, whoohooh!]. Duh. So random.  
这个女人笑得像个白痴，我真想狠狠揍她一顿。作者，这是什么，你把我变成虐待狂了吗？等等。为了休息，我是个虐待狂。哦，看看《EVA》漫画的最新章节，事情变得有点火热[GendoxRei 的粉丝们，哇呼！]。真是太随意了。

We barged inside with Shinji carrying me, still, in his loving arms. Pwe. That's a nasty joke I made there, sorry. Gah, sounded like scrawny Shinji with that last word, forget that reader. I was about to make a scene and complain when I remembered Ayanami, what will she say when she saw us like this? How will she react? It's hopeless, she's emotionless. Shinji suddenly put me down.  
我们闯了进去，Shinji 还抱着我，依旧在他充满爱意的臂弯里。噗，那是个糟糕的笑话，抱歉。啊，听起来像瘦弱的 Shinji，忘了那个读者吧。我正要大闹一场并抱怨时，想起了 Ayanami，她看到我们这样会说什么？她会怎么反应？没希望了，她毫无感情。Shinji 突然把我放了下来。

"Perfect! Now we're four. Hey Rei, come here!"  
“完美！现在我们有四个人了。嘿，Rei，过来！”

Misato's plotting something, that doesn't sound good. With a large grin still planted on her face, she's holding a large brown object. Curiosity killed the cat, I'm no cat but I think I don't want myself involved in her plans. Ayanami with her boring entrance stared at Shinji who by the way was still lost in his own thoughts, apparently thinking, _I__should__have__my__own__POV__author_, he's such an emo y'know.  
Misato 在策划什么，听起来不妙。她脸上依旧挂着大大的笑容，手里拿着一个巨大的棕色物体。好奇心害死猫，我不是猫，但我觉得自己不想卷入她的计划。Ayanami 以她一贯的无趣方式入场，盯着 Shinji，而 Shinji 显然还在自己的思绪中迷失，显然在想，我__应该__有自己的__视角__作者，他真是个情绪化的家伙，你知道的。

"Guys listen. This is a Ouija board. You could call it a game but way too dangerous to be a normal one. It'll help us talk and if we're lucky even see spirits. Any kind. Dead people baby! Sounds great? Yeah?"  
"伙计们，听着。这是一块通灵板。你可以称之为游戏，但它的危险性远超普通游戏。它能帮我们与灵魂交流，如果运气好的话，甚至能看到它们。任何类型的。死人宝贝！听起来很棒吧？是吧？"

You call that lucky Misato? Then we already have too much luck! Shinji's not listening, I'm... I don't know how to react to that, Ayanami, NOTHING to expect dude and pen-pen, uhm, he's a penguin.  
你把这叫做幸运吗，美里？那我们已经有太多运气了！真嗣没在听，我...我不知道该怎么反应，绫波，没什么可期待的，伙计，还有企鹅潘-潘，呃，他是一只企鹅。

"Now common', show me some excitement will you. This. Is. FUN! Ho Ho Ho... Let's gather in the living room."  
"好了，别这样，给我点兴奋感好吗。这。是。有趣的！呵呵呵...我们去客厅集合吧。"

Ayanami followed without a second thought, she's obeying anything anyway. Regarding Shinji and I, too much stress, dismay, when will it end? We're cursed. I felt a strong grip in my right hand. A cold sensation followed. No way. Is this Lolita baby? She followed us!  
绫波毫无迟疑地跟了上来，反正她总是言听计从。至于我和真嗣，压力重重，忧心忡忡，何时才是尽头？我们似乎被诅咒了。我感到右手被紧紧握住，随后是一阵冰冷的感觉。不可能。难道这是洛丽塔宝贝？她跟着我们！

"To my room, stay with me..."  
“去我房间，陪着我……”

_Sigh._ Goodness gracious. It's only Shinji.  
唉。天哪。原来是真嗣。

_Pause._

Darn.

What did he say?  
他说了什么？

T.B.C.

**A/N:** That's, again, short. Haha. I have work and this is just something that I do if I have some spare moments, so yeah, really don't have that much time to write long chapters. Sorry for that. To pay for it, Ta Da~  
作者注：这章又很短，哈哈。我有工作，这只是我闲暇时的一点消遣，所以真的没有太多时间写长章节。对此感到抱歉。为了弥补，瞧~

### Chapter 4

"Hey.. Hey.. wait up!"

It's been a long day for us and we're pretty messed up after all the weird things that's happened. It's not even halloween to begin with. I know that it was kind of hard to be certain of but it sure was different from something that you just heard and something that you actually experienced. And here we are, playing tug-of-war using my arms. So i can't balme him if..  
对我们来说，今天真是漫长的一天，经历了那么多奇怪的事情后，我们都有些混乱。甚至还没到万圣节呢。我知道这有点难以确定，但它确实与只是听说和实际经历的事情截然不同。而现在，我们正用我的手臂玩拔河。所以如果……

"I want to stay with you. Please. Don't leave me alone.."  
"我想和你在一起。求你了。别让我一个人。"

Yeah. That's what he exactly said. I was a little afraid too, but still...  
是啊。他确实是这么说的。我也有点害怕，但还是……

"No way! What the hell Shinji - we've been fighting angels all this time! Are you for real? Crap. You're such a weako." Like i'm somewhere near being a hero myself. I kept on pulling my arm but he's strong.  
"不可能！搞什么啊，真嗣——我们一直在和使徒战斗！你是认真的吗？糟糕。你真是太弱了。" 好像我自己有多接近英雄似的。我一直在拉我的手臂，但他很强壮。

"Asuka. This is different. She's after me! I.. don't want to.. I.. i hate lolita. Damn. I'm no lolicon you know!" He finnaly let go of my arm but before I could totally back away from him he grabbed my mid-section and carried me on his shoulder as we went inside he's room. My struggles didn't even work. This man lost it.  
"明日香，这不一样。她是冲我来的！我...不想...我...我讨厌萝莉。该死。你知道我不是萝莉控！" 他终于放开了我的手臂，但就在我完全后退之前，他抓住了我的腰，把我扛在肩上，带进了他的房间。我的挣扎毫无作用。这家伙彻底疯了。

"You're going to pay for this mister." I said with an irritated but undertoned voice. He settled me down on his bed and sat beside me.  
"你会为此付出代价的，先生。" 我带着恼怒但压低的声音说道。他把我放在床上，坐在我旁边。

"Name the price ojou-sama, just.. don't leave me. Just this once Asuka."  
"大小姐，开出你的条件吧，只是...别离开我。就这一次，明日香。"

"My gosh, could you be any more pathetic? Just don't do anything stupid."  
"天哪，你能再可怜一点吗？别做傻事了。"

Silence and darkness engulfed us for a good minute or two when someone banged so hard on the door.  
沉默与黑暗笼罩了我们一两分钟，突然有人用力敲门。

"The heck was that?" I reacted first.  
"那是什么鬼？" 我首先反应过来。

"Could that be -" I didn't let him finish because I know what he's about to say.  
"难道那是——" 我没让他把话说完，因为我知道他要说什么。

"No. That is not lolita freak moron. Misato and Ayanami are in the living room after all. Misato would freak out if ever she sees her and Ayanami would still be Ayanami I guess." I stood up and opened the door.  
"不，那可不是洛丽塔变态白痴。美里和绫波都在客厅呢。要是美里看到她，肯定会抓狂的，而绫波嘛，估计还是那个绫波。" 我站起身，打开了门。

"See? No lolita freak but... still a freak. What do you need?" It was Ayanami who was gloriously banging the door. Her intentions? Well... She lightly pushed me aside, yeah lightly but still! My eyes widened as the blood rushed up to my face and my anger arose. She then lunged at Shinji who was as clueless as I am on what's happened to this enigma. She pushed him on the bed and proceeded on climbing atop of him and began strangling him.  
"看吧？没有洛丽塔变态，但...还是有变态。你有什么事吗？" 是绫波，她气势汹汹地撞开了门。她的意图？嗯...她轻轻地把我推到一边，虽然只是轻轻的，但还是让我血脉贲张，怒火中烧。接着，她扑向了真嗣，他和我一样对这突如其来的谜团一无所知。她把他推倒在床上，然后爬到他身上，开始掐他的脖子。

"Onii-chan..." That's what I heard her say or somewhat whisper. Why would she call him that by the way! Much to his horror, Shinji thought she was possessed by the lolita.  
“哥哥...” 我听到她这么说，或者说几乎是低声呢喃。她为什么要那样称呼他呢！令他惊恐的是，真嗣以为她被萝莉鬼魂附身了。

I'm not sure what's the mentality behind this rather nasty stunt which she did but it made me sick, the acting was cheesy as hell. So I did what I thought was the right thing to do, since the idiot clearly won't fight back.  
我不确定她这么做背后的心理是什么，但这恶劣的举动让我感到恶心，演技烂透了。所以我做了我认为正确的事，既然那个白痴显然不会还手。

"You perverted albino! Get off him!" I pulled a few good strands of her hair with all might. I don't know if its because I wanted to save him or its only that I don't want to see them all clingy like that, though the negative way.  
“你这个变态的白化病患者！放开他！”我用尽全力扯了她几根头发。我不知道是因为我想救他，还是仅仅因为我不想看到他们那样黏糊糊的样子，尽管是以一种消极的方式。

"Hey! Waa! Asuka! Stop!" Misato managed to drag me and my deranged hands away from Ayanami.  
"嘿！哇！明日香！住手！" 美里好不容易才把我那双疯狂的手从绫波身上拉开。

"Really! Why aren't you stopping this lunatic instead!" After scratching her head, she finally pulled Ayanami away from a bewildered teenage boy. I sat next to him as he sat up without the puzzlement leaving his face.  
"真是的！你怎么不阻止这个疯子！" 她抓了抓头，终于把绫波从一脸茫然的少年身边拉开。我坐在他旁边，他坐起身来，脸上的困惑依旧未消。

"You okay?" Did I just sound worried that time? He simply nodded unable to say anything. I sighed and threw the other two girls a death glare.  
"你还好吗？" 我刚才听起来是不是有点担心？他只是点点头，说不出话来。我叹了口气，向另外两个女孩投去一个死亡凝视。

"My, my.. Asuka.. Cool it off. We're just having fun. He he. You see, I told Rei to act as if she's possessed. Right Rei?" The blue-haired nodded. "But she seemed psychotic than possessed isn;t it... ha ha ha." She continued as I continue to shower them with dirty looks.  
"哎呀呀.. 明日香.. 冷静点。我们只是在找乐子。呵呵。你看，我让丽装作被附身的样子。对吧，丽？" 蓝发女孩点了点头。"但她看起来更像疯了而不是被附身，不是吗...哈哈哈。" 她继续说着，而我继续用不满的眼神盯着她们。

"Oh common, forgive us Asuka. We'll go out now, okay? You two might be having a stressful day and we made it worse."  
"哦，拜托，原谅我们吧，明日香。我们现在就出去，好吗？你们俩可能今天压力很大，我们又添乱了。"

"Damn right Misato! Now get out you two!" I threw a pillow but too late, it hit the closed door. Another sigh from me. Misato creeped her head back. "Uhm.. you sleeping together? Since when? So, you having this kinda relationship now huh."  
"没错，美里！现在你们俩出去！" 我扔了个枕头，但太迟了，它撞在了关上的门上。我又叹了口气。美里悄悄探回头来。"呃.. 你们一起睡吗？从什么时候开始的？所以，你们现在这种关系了，嗯？"

"None of your business freakin-A!" After grinning so wide, gosh I want to kill her just this once, she shut the door.  
“关你屁事，真是的！”她笑得那么开怀，天啊，就这一次，我真想杀了她，然后她关上了门。

I'm so damn right. It was indeed the longest night we ever had.  
我真是太对了。那确实是我们经历过的最长的一夜。

t.b.c.

A/N:

I've been M.I.A. for a good long time ain't I? haha. But anyways, here I am again. :) Will update as often as possible. Thanks.  
我消失了好一阵子，对吧？哈哈。不过不管怎样，我又回来了。:) 会尽量频繁更新的。谢谢大家。

### Chapter 5
"My.. My.." "我的.. 我的.."

Unfamiliar ceiling. I felt a bit different though it wasn't a bother that much. Oh right, I'm in his room after all, that's why. I couldn't sleep. I've been lying for, well.. I don't even know for how long. My eyes, they're kind of sore. Damn it, i'm freakin tired why can't I be off to dreamland. Sigh.  
陌生的天花板。虽然感觉有点不同，但并不太困扰。哦对了，毕竟我在他的房间里，难怪。我睡不着。我已经躺了，嗯.. 连我自己都不知道多久了。我的眼睛有点酸痛。该死，我累得要命，为什么就是不能进入梦乡。唉。

He's lying on a futon while I took his bed. And, of course, that's what I expect him to do. He looked like a baby, peacefully sleeping. This guy, he was totally crazy just a while ago. I guess being with someone else does ease some of his worries. I'm not sure, but somehow, I felt calm seeing him like that. On the other hand, I was severely suffering from lack of sleep.  
他躺在榻榻米上，而我占了他的床。当然，这也是我预料之中的事。他看起来像个婴儿，安详地睡着。这家伙，刚才还完全疯疯癫癫的。我想，和别人在一起确实能缓解他的一些忧虑。我不确定，但不知为何，看到他那样，我感到平静。另一方面，我却严重缺乏睡眠，痛苦不堪。

Why did I even agree to this? Sleeping together? Yes, not in the same bed but inside the same room? What's happened to me? I pushed away the silly thoughts. Well, it already happened. Whatever. I need to use the bathroom. I tried to leave the room as quiet as possible.  
我到底为什么会同意这个？一起睡？是的，不是同一张床，而是在同一个房间里？我这是怎么了？我甩开了那些愚蠢的想法。好吧，事情已经发生了。无所谓了。我需要用一下洗手间。我尽量安静地离开房间。

I walked down the hallway while rubbing my eye when I noticed something inside the bathroom.  
我揉着眼睛走过走廊，这时注意到洗手间里有东西。

"What is that?" “那是什么？”

I looked closely, it moved! Gosh, that made me flinched.  
我仔细一看，它动了！天哪，吓得我一哆嗦。

"What the heck? When I thought everything's done, what is this now. Err~ Dammit."  
“搞什么鬼？我以为一切都结束了，这又是什么。呃~ 该死。”

SIgh. I really needed to use the effin' bathroom. I clicked the switch, it was gone. But when I turned it off, I gulped quite hard, it's still there after all!  
唉。我真的急需去个厕所。我按下开关，它消失了。但当我关掉开关，我咽了口唾沫，它居然还在！

"This is bullcrap! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?"  
"这简直是胡扯！你到底是什么鬼东西？"

It moved again! That sent shivers down my spine. I couldn't see it when the lights are on, but if by twisted faith that there's another blackout, what will I do! Or should I say, what will IT do to me? That's it! There's no chance I would enter the bathroom with that black whatsoever inside! I went back inside ou- Ehem! Let me rephrase it, I went back inside his room. I don't have another choice but to hold it in.  
它又动了！这让我脊背发凉。灯亮着时我看不见它，但如果命运捉弄，再来一次停电，我该怎么办！或者应该说，它会对**我**做什么？没错！我绝不会进那个有黑影的浴室！我回到了...咳咳！让我换个说法，我回到了他的房间。我别无选择，只能忍着。

5 minutes, 15 minutes, half an hour passed.  
5 分钟，15 分钟，半小时过去了。

"..."

I can't! I can't hold it any longer. I lightly shook the boy who's sleeping soundly on the futon. After several attempts, he finally woke up.  
我不行了！我再也憋不住了。我轻轻摇晃着那个在蒲团上熟睡的男孩。经过几次尝试，他终于醒了过来。

"At last!" “终于！”

"What is it Asuka?" “怎么了，明日香？”

"Uhmm.. Ah..." "嗯...啊..."

"Yes? Do you need something?" He said softly before yawning. I look rather dismayed thinking of this nasty favor i'm about to ask him.  
"什么事？你需要什么吗？" 他轻声说道，随后打了个哈欠。我看起来相当沮丧，想着即将向他提出的这个令人不快的请求。

"Could you... come with me for a minute?"  
"你能...跟我来一下吗？"

"Sure..." "当然..."

"..."

"?" "？"

"Why are you blushing Asuka?"  
"为什么你脸红了，明日香？"

"Shut up! Let's go!" I grabbed his hand ignoring my flushed face, gosh I know this is something that I would surely regret for the rest of my life but it can't be helped right? Right? Oh common.  
"闭嘴！走吧！" 我抓住他的手，无视自己涨红的脸，天啊，我知道这肯定是我余生都会后悔的事，但没办法对吧？对吧？哦，别这样。

I dragged a still sleepy Shinji with me, back to.. you know exactly where. We stopped at the bathroom's entrance, standing silently side by side.  
我拖着依然昏昏欲睡的真嗣，回到了……你知道是哪里。我们在浴室入口停下，默默地并肩站着。

"Ah... Asuka? What... are we supposed to do in front of the bathroom?"  
"啊……明日香？我们……在浴室前该做什么？"

"Please... accompany me in the bathroom." He raised a brow as if he's not grasping what I meant by those words.  
"请...陪我进洗手间。" 他挑了挑眉，似乎没明白我那句话的意思。

"You know-" "你知道——"

"I'm already with you, don't I Asuka? Now, go on, I won't go anywhere. I'll stay right here." He rubbed his eye while patting my back lightly.  
"我已经在你身边了，不是吗，明日香？现在，继续吧，我不会去任何地方。我会一直在这里。" 他揉了揉眼睛，同时轻轻拍了拍我的背。

"I.. de.." I whispered, meek enough that he wasn't able to hear it clearly.  
"我...的..." 我低声呢喃，声音小到他没能听清楚。

"What ?" "什么？"

"I SAID INSIDE!" "我说进去！"

"WHAAAAAAT?" "什什什什什什什？！"

Now, that sure woke him up, completely, ain't it?  
这下可真把他彻底弄醒了，不是吗？
