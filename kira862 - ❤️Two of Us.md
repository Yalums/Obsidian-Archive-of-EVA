Third Impact had been avoided, for better or for worse. The world had been saved, and everything was set as it should be. But was that really true? For two people, that may not necessarily be true.  
第三次冲击被避免了，无论结果是好是坏。世界得救了，一切回归正轨。但这真的就是真相吗？对两个人来说，这未必是事实。

Shinji and Asuka had connected with each other, they had loved each other, they had fought for each other, and then at the end of it all, they had lost each other. Had everything been futile then? Had every moment they had ever spent with each other been for naught? Maybe this was true, but the body remembered.  
真嗣和明日香曾彼此相连，他们相爱，为对方而战，最终却失去了彼此。那么，这一切都是徒劳的吗？他们共度的每一刻都毫无意义吗？或许确实如此，但身体却记得。

Love is a strange thing, and love can vary from person to person. The love of a husband and wife; the love of a father and mother; the love of a boyfriend and girlfriend. Love can vary depending on the individuals definition of what "love" is. Love is more an emotion, more like a feeling you have when you are around somebody, something which can't be replicated no matter how many times you attempt to recreate it.  
爱是一种奇妙的东西，因人而异。夫妻之爱；父母之爱；男女朋友之爱。爱的定义因人而异。爱更多是一种情感，一种当你在别人身边时的感觉，无论尝试多少次都无法复制。

So then what hope did Shinji and Asuka ever have to love each other again? Maybe it was simply the fact that they were drawn to each other, that such an outcome was always unthinkable. But that love had to be rekindled, reborn to what it once was.  
那么，真嗣和明日香还有什么希望再次相爱呢？也许仅仅是因为他们被彼此吸引，这样的结果总是难以想象。但那份爱必须重新点燃，重生为曾经的模样。

Love is an abstract thing, similar to that of AT-fields and memories. It can't be seen, except in the vision of the person who is seeing it. Some describe it as red, while others simply describe it as a warm feeling in the heart. People try to explain what they feel, but are unable to. Why is that? Is it because they don't understand each other? That they don't understand what love is?"  
爱是一种抽象的东西，类似于 AT 力场和记忆。它看不见，除非在看到它的人的视野中。有人形容它是红色的，而其他人则简单地描述为心中的温暖感觉。人们试图解释他们的感受，但却无法做到。为什么呢？是因为他们彼此不理解吗？还是因为他们不明白什么是爱？

Then what about Shinji and Asuka? Neither of them understood what love was when they first met, having never experienced such a thing in either of there lives before meeting each other. So then, how was it that two fifteen year olds were able to understand the concept better then adults? Is it because they were younger, that they didn't understand things?  
那么，真嗣和明日香呢？他们初次相遇时都不明白什么是爱，因为在此之前他们都没有经历过这样的事情。那么，两个十五岁的孩子是如何比成年人更好地理解这个概念的呢？是因为他们年轻，所以不懂事吗？

Or was it because that they had first connected as human beings, before making that next giant leap?  
还是因为他们首先作为人类建立了联系，然后才迈出了那巨大的一步？

Whatever the reason was, Shinji and Asuka had once loved each other, that much was certain. But now, as the earth settled back into its normal rotation, and the Tree of Life began regrowing, they would have to make do with what was given to them. Third Impact was over with, and the Lilim would return one day and reside once again upon the earth. But until then, Shinji and Asuka were given time to grow whole once again.  
无论原因是什么，碇真嗣和明日香曾经相爱过，这一点是毋庸置疑的。但现在，随着地球恢复正常的自转，生命之树开始重新生长，他们只能接受所给予的一切。第三次冲击已经结束，人类将有一天会重返地球。但在那之前，真嗣和明日香被赋予了时间，让他们再次变得完整。

Shinji opened his eyes groggily; he had passed into a restless sleep, nothing of which he seemed to have recalled. He had dreamt something, but he didn't know what.  
真嗣昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛；他陷入了一个不安的睡眠，似乎什么都没记住。他做了个梦，但不知道是什么。

He instead turned his gaze to the girl lying on the beach next to him. She was still motionless. Shinji had checked every hour or so, but she still continued breathing normally. Once or twice, he had almost nudged her gently, but stopped himself at the last minute. Part of him wanted to continue watching her sleep, but the other part of him wanted to talk to her, to get to know her, to understand who she was.  
他转而将目光投向躺在沙滩上的女孩。她依然一动不动。真嗣每隔一小时左右就会检查一次，但她仍然正常呼吸。有一两次，他几乎轻轻地碰了她一下，但最后一刻停住了。一部分他想继续看着她睡觉，但另一部分他想和她说话，了解她，理解她是谁。

Shinji was admittedly lonely, and he was rather surprised at that. He had never cared much about people before, but this girl who he had never once seen in his life...  
真嗣确实感到孤独，对此他颇为惊讶。他以前从未真正在意过别人，但这个女孩，他一生中从未见过一面...

'What is wrong with me?' thought Shinji.  
'我这是怎么了？' 真嗣心想。

Looking once more at her pale skin and her sleeping face, Shinji turned away from her, and passed into another fitful sleep, in which his thoughts were filled with that girls face.  
再次看向她苍白的皮肤和沉睡的面容，真嗣转过身去，陷入了另一场不安的睡眠，梦中满是那个女孩的面容。

### Chapter 2: New Beginnings  
第二章：新的开始  

**ANNNNNNNND I'M BACK. Wow Jesus how long has it been...four months I think? Anyway yeah sorry guys about that long bout of nothing. I just had so much stuff going on during that last term of school that this was put on the back burner for a long time. But I'm back to updating this (for a while at least, things might get slow again in September). So again, thanks to everybody that waited patiently for this and I apologize for the wait.  
我回来了。哇，天哪，这都过去多久了……四个月吧？总之，很抱歉让大家等了这么久。上个学期我实在太忙了，以至于这件事一直被搁置。但现在我又回来更新了（至少暂时是这样，九月可能又会慢下来）。再次感谢所有耐心等待的朋友，对于等待我深表歉意。**

---

Shinji opened his eyes slowly.  
真嗣缓缓睁开了眼睛。

For several seconds, as he looked around, he didn't know where he was.  
有几秒钟，他环顾四周，不知道自己在哪里。

Then he looked down at the girl next to him with strawberry colored hair and he remembered. Or at least, he remembered some things...  
然后他低头看着身边那个草莓色头发的女孩，他想起来了。或者说，至少他想起了一些事情……

The sun was setting over on the horizon, turning the blood colored water a sickly red hue. The capsized battleships floating meaninglessly out in the Bay of Tokyo-3, their purposes long served. Above the beaches where Shinji sat on, the city of Tokyo-3 lay quietly, almost as though it was sleeping peacefully. Such a calm sound had not been heard in this part of the world for a long forgotten time.  
太阳正缓缓沉入地平线，将血色的水面染成病态的红色。倾覆的战舰无意义地漂浮在东京-3 湾，它们早已完成了使命。在真嗣坐着的沙滩上方，东京-3 市静静地躺着，仿佛在安详地沉睡。这片世界的一隅，已经很久没有听到过如此平静的声音了。

Amidst all of this, Shinji and the girl next to him where the only two people that stood out among the destruction of Tokyo-3 and the world.  
在这片混乱之中，唯有真嗣和他身旁的女孩在东京-3 及世界的废墟中显得格外突出。

Shinji continued gazing at the sun, watching it slowly continue setting, seemingly sinking into the ocean. Now that he was awake, he had to admit that he was a little afraid.  
真嗣继续凝视着太阳，看着它缓缓西沉，仿佛沉入了大海。醒来后，他不得不承认自己有些害怕。

During his brief nap, he had hoped that more humans would show up, someone that could help him, or even explain what had happened to everything. But now, with night starting, he was having to face reality that he may be the only person in the city.  
在短暂的打盹期间，他曾希望会有更多的人出现，能有人帮助他，或是解释这一切是如何发生的。但如今夜幕降临，他不得不面对现实，自己可能是这座城市里唯一的幸存者。

'Or at least one of the only people,' he thought as he eyes trailed down towards the girl next to him. Her chest was still slowly moving up and down, indicating that she was breathing, but Shinji had hoped that she would have woken up while he had been asleep. He would at least have someone to talk to and maybe she even knew what had happened. Her attire would certainly suggest that she wasn't a normal fifteen year old girl.  
“或者说至少是其中之一，”他心想，目光顺着身旁女孩的方向滑落。她的胸膛仍在缓缓起伏，表明她还活着，但真嗣本希望她能在他熟睡时醒来。那样至少有人可以交谈，或许她甚至知道发生了什么。她的装束无疑表明她不是普通的十五岁少女。

Shinji looked at her for a few seconds longer, letting his eyes travel over her face before he shook his head and stood up. He didn't know what he was gonna do, but simply sitting wasn't helping. He needed to think.  
真嗣又多看了她几秒钟，目光在她脸上游移，随后摇了摇头站起身来。他不知道自己该做什么，但只是坐着无济于事。他需要思考。

Standing up he directed his gaze farther down the beach and then up the sandy slope behind him to the wreckage that was Tokyo-3. He supposed that he would have to go into the city eventually, but he didn't feel like he was ready for that. Things still hadn't...quite sunk in yet.  
站起身来，他将视线投向更远的沙滩，然后转向身后沙坡上的废墟——东京-3。他想自己迟早得进城，但感觉还没准备好面对这一切。事情仍未完全……沉入心底。

Digging his hands into his pockets, he started walking along the beach, just as the sun disappeared across the water.  
他将双手插进口袋，沿着海滩开始漫步，就在太阳消失在水面之际。

'Okay...what had happened?' was Shinji's first thought.  
'好吧……发生了什么？'这是真嗣的第一个念头。

The end of the world was the most apparent answer, but Shinji couldn't just take that laying down.  
世界末日是最显而易见的答案，但真嗣不能就这样躺平接受。

He been living in Tokyo-3 for what...half a year or so? His father had sent him here at the beginning of the year and made him live at an apartment with some guy. His father had brought him here for an unknown reason, but Shinji had wondered if it hadn't had something to do with Nerv. He could remember waking up this morning and going to class and everything as if it was a normal day...and then nothing. Several hours seemed to have just been taken out of his memory it seemed like. He was supposed to be living with a new roommate tomorrow also, but that didn't seem like it would be happening anytime soon.  
他在第三新东京市住了多久来着...大概半年左右吧？年初时，他的父亲把他送到这里，让他和一个家伙住在公寓里。父亲带他来这里的原因不明，但真嗣怀疑这与 NERV 有关。他记得今早醒来去上课，一切都像平常一样...然后就什么都没有了。几个小时似乎从他的记忆中消失了。他原本明天要和一个新室友一起住，但那似乎不会很快发生。

Kicking his feet as he walked along the sand, he looked towards a large building that seemed to have been a hotel of some sorts. It looked like the building had been in disrepair for several years. Was it somehow possible that Shinji had been sent into the future somehow?  
他一边沿着沙滩走，一边踢着脚下的沙子，目光投向一座看似曾是酒店的大型建筑。那栋楼看起来已经破败多年。难道真嗣不知怎么地被送到了未来？

'Thats fucking stupid,' thought Shinji. 'No...something more plausible than that.'  
'这他妈的太蠢了，'真嗣心想。'不...比那更合理的事情。'

Though he honestly couldn't think of anything.  
虽然他真的想不出任何事情。

Stopping suddenly he looked up towards the sky and was surprised that he could see the stars. He couldn't remember ever seeing the stars his entire time living in Tokyo-3.  
他突然停下脚步，抬头望向天空，惊讶地发现自己能看到星星。他不记得自己在东京-3 生活的整个时间里曾见过星星。

"Are there really no other humans?" mumbled Shinji.  
“真的没有其他人类了吗？”真嗣喃喃自语。

He had never really enjoyed associating with people, but to just have everyone disappear all at once was just too strange.  
他从未真正喜欢与人交往，但所有人突然间全部消失，这未免太过诡异。

"It doesn't make any sense," sighed Shinji.  
“这毫无道理，”真嗣叹息道。

Running a hand through his hair he looked back towards the way he had come. He could still see the body of the girl in the distance, and was glad that he could still see her. Though the darkness was certainly starting to get heavier, and without the light from Tokyo-3-  
他用手梳理着头发，回头望向他来时的路。他仍能看到远处那女孩的遗体，庆幸自己还能看见她。尽管黑暗确实开始变得浓重，若没有第三新东京市的光亮——

'This might be a problem,' thought Shinji.  
“这可能是个问题，”真嗣心想。

He didn't know what had happened, or why it seemed only himself and the strange girl were alive in the city, but right now he had to focus on other things.  
他不知道发生了什么，或者为什么这座城市里似乎只有他和那个陌生女孩还活着，但此刻他必须专注于其他事情。

Walking to the edge of the water, he ran his hand in it, but only felt the odd substance of the fluid, almost like sand. It was like he was on a different world, a separate earth. Nothing made sense.  
走到水边，他伸手进去，却只感觉到那种奇怪的液体，几乎像沙子一样。这感觉就像他身处另一个世界，一个截然不同的地球。一切都说不通。

'I'm alive though, so I suppose I should be thankful for that.'  
'我还活着，所以我想我应该为此感到庆幸。'

Though was he really being honest? With the world as it was, living would be-  
尽管他真的诚实吗？在这个世界上，活着会是——

Shinji stopped himself here; it was pointless to think about anything other than the next hour of his life.  
真嗣在这里打断了自己的思绪；除了接下来的一个小时，思考其他任何事情都是没有意义的。

Turning towards the ruins of Tokyo-3, a frown passed over his face. He knew that he would have to explore them tonight, even if he didn't really want to. And though he didn't want to admit it, the fact that the girl hadn't woken up yet was starting to trouble him.  
转身望向东京-3 的废墟，他眉头紧锁。他知道今晚必须去探查一番，尽管内心并不情愿。而且，尽管他不愿承认，女孩至今未醒的事实开始让他感到困扰。

Moving away from the water, he decided on his course, though whether it was the correct or wrong decision, he didn't know.  
离开水边，他决定了自己的路线，尽管这决定是对是错，他无从知晓。

Walking back to where the girl lay didn't take long and he was soon caught in a problem; he didn't want to let her out of his sight. It was worry more than anything. He didn't want to run the risk of him not being there when she woke up, or if something more serious happened-  
走回女孩躺着的地方并不需要太久，很快他就遇到了一个问题；他不想让她离开自己的视线。更多的是出于担忧。他不想冒着她醒来时或发生更严重情况时自己不在的风险——

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

'Best not to think about that,' he thought.  
'最好别去想那件事，'他心想。

On the other hand though, he couldn't very well carry her. It would have been...awkward.  
不过另一方面，他也不太可能把她抱起来。那样会显得...很尴尬。

'What to do,' thought Shinji. 'I don't want to leave her, but at the same time I don't have much of a choice.'  
“该怎么办呢，”真嗣心想，“我不想离开她，但同时我也没有太多选择。”

Shinji then noticed a piece of driftwood not too far off in the distance. Looking around him, he noticed that there was a strange amount of wood laying around the beach, most of which seemed to have been splintered off from buildings.  
随后，真嗣注意到不远处有一块浮木。环顾四周，他发现海滩上散落着大量木头，其中大部分似乎是从建筑物上碎裂下来的。

"Right...a fire would work," mumbled Shinji as he started counting the pieces of wood. The fire would help not only to relieve his worries of the girl, but also if there were any more survivors, they may see the flames and be drawn to it.  
"“对……生火应该有用，”真嗣喃喃自语，开始数起木柴的数量。火不仅能缓解他对女孩的担忧，如果有其他幸存者，他们也可能看到火光而被吸引过来。”

'But making it is another problem,' frowned Shinji. He had never tried lighting a flame without anything other than a match.  
"“但生火又是另一个问题，”真嗣皱眉道。他从未尝试过不用火柴以外的任何东西点燃火焰。”

'One step at a time,' he told himself as he stood up. He was rather glad to be moving and having a set goal to work towards. It certainly kept his mind off of other things.  
“一步一个脚印，”他自言自语道，站起身来。能够行动并有一个明确的目标去努力，他感到相当欣慰。这无疑让他的思绪从其他事情上转移开来。

Gathering up as much dry wood as he could, he then scaled the sandy slope behind him to the top where there was some dry brush and picked several handfuls and brought it back down to the beach. He didn't have any sort of way to chop the wood so he dug a hole in the sand using one of the pieces of wood and dug himself a sand pit. Placing the larger pieces of wood at the bottom, he stacked it higher with the smaller pieces, hoping that it would burn longer like this. He kept a pile of wood next to this pit as extra kindling incase the flames started to die down.  
他尽可能多地收集干木柴，然后爬上身后沙质的斜坡，到达顶部有一些干枯灌木的地方，抓了几大把带回海滩。他没有工具来劈开木头，于是用一根木头在沙地上挖了一个洞，为自己挖了一个沙坑。他将较大的木块放在底部，用较小的木块堆叠得更高，希望这样能让火燃烧得更久。他在沙坑旁留了一堆木柴作为额外的引火物，以防火焰开始减弱。

Now though, the problem was exactly how he was going to make those flames.  
不过现在，问题在于他究竟要如何制造出那些火焰。

Climbing back up the slope he stood up at the top and looked towards the destruction of Tokyo-3. Everything was much more apparent up here.  
他爬回坡顶，站起身来，望向被摧毁的第三新东京市。站在这里，一切景象都更加清晰可见。

The shops and stores that littered the edge of the beach looked as though they had been bombed from the inside. Empty holes filled the window frames and twisting pieces of metal lined the sides of them, indicating that they were once chairs and tables. Most likely a coffee shop of some kind. Thankfully though, a road also ran along this stretch of the beach and Shinji didn't think he would have to search far before he found a lighter.  
散布在海滩边缘的商店和店铺看起来就像是从内部被轰炸过一样。窗框里填满了空洞，扭曲的金属片沿着两侧排列，表明它们曾经是椅子和桌子。很可能是某种咖啡店。不过幸运的是，海滩这一段也有一条路，真嗣认为他不用费多大力气就能找到一个打火机。

Any thought that what he was doing was wrong must have been long since abandoned, because Shinji had no problems going through the cars, purses, glove compartments, and other peoples belongings as he searched for a lighter. Maybe it was because of his disassociation with people in general, or maybe he just buried that part of his mind which told him it was wrong. Certainly if there had been bodies in the cars like he had initially been worried about, or the peoples clothes he would have had second thoughts. But without any of this, he was able to pick through things without thinking about it.  
任何认为他所做的事情是错误的念头肯定早已被抛诸脑后，因为真嗣在寻找打火机时，毫不犹豫地翻遍了汽车、钱包、手套箱和其他人的物品。也许是因为他与人们普遍的疏离感，或者他只是埋葬了那部分告诉他这是错误的思想。当然，如果车里有像他最初担心的尸体，或者人们的衣物，他可能会有所犹豫。但没有这些，他就能毫不犹豫地翻找东西。

Finally after about the seventh car he had been through, he found a lighter on the ground of the drive side door. Flicking it on, a golden flame lit in front of him and seemed to wave back and forth at him. Flicking it off, Shinji leaned out of the car and stood up.  
终于，在检查了大约第七辆车后，他在驾驶座车门的地板上发现了一个打火机。轻轻一按，一簇金色的火焰在他面前燃起，似乎在向他摇摆。关掉打火机，真嗣探出车外，站了起来。

Sliding back down the slope to the beach below, he jogged to the fire pit and kneeled down next to it. Setting the brush on top of the wood, he placed the lighter in the brush and lit it. Grabbing some of the smaller logs, he placed them gently on top of the brush, letting the logs catch fire. Shifting the logs that were now lit around, he proceeded to gently stroke the fire, catching the sparks on the other pieces of wood. Tokyo-3's nights could be particularly brutal at times, and Shinji wanted not only himself, but the girl to be warm.  
他滑下斜坡回到海滩，小跑向篝火坑，跪在旁边。将树枝放在木头上，他把打火机放在树枝中点燃。抓起一些小木柴，轻轻放在树枝上，让木柴着火。移动已经点燃的木柴，他开始温柔地拨弄火焰，让火花点燃其他木块。第三新东京市的夜晚有时特别严酷，真嗣不仅希望自己，也希望那个女孩能感到温暖。

Glancing over at her, he saw that she was still sleeping...or unconscious. He wasn't really sure to be true. But she was still breathing, and that seemed to be okay.  
他瞥了她一眼，发现她还在睡...或者是不省人事。他不太确定真相如何。但她仍在呼吸，这似乎还算好。

With the fire roaring now and warmth starting to spread through his body, Shinji's mind went back to the darkness of Tokyo-3. He wasn't tired, and this surprised him since he had been up and down that slope now twice over, but he wasn't sure if he was ready to look for anything else in that darkness.  
随着火焰熊熊燃烧，温暖开始传遍全身，真嗣的思绪回到了东京-3 的黑暗中。他并不困倦，这让他感到惊讶，因为他已经在这斜坡上上下下了两次，但他不确定自己是否准备好在这黑暗中寻找其他东西。

He was hungry however, and this suddenly became apparent as he felt his stomach rumble.  
他饿了，这一点突然变得明显，因为他感到肚子咕噜作响。

Food was one thing, but water was entirely different. If he put it off till tomorrow, would he still be able to get it? He couldn't imagine these buildings being in the best condition and hadn't really thought until now about the dangers of one of those falling down when he was near one, or worse, inside of one. But wandering around in the dark was a different situation all together.  
食物尚可应付，但水却是另一回事。如果他拖延到明天，还能否得到水呢？他无法想象这些建筑能保持最佳状态，直到此刻才真正考虑到靠近或更糟地置身其中一座倒塌的危险。但在黑暗中徘徊则是完全不同的境况。

'And I'm still worried about her...' thought Shinji as his eyes went to the girl in the strange outfit. He had no idea what her situation was. Whether she was hungry, thirsty, or anything of the sorts, but if the fire did end up going out during the night, then the cold breeze of the ocean would be sure to freeze them quickly. Getting a cold was certainly the last thing he desired right now.  
'我还是担心她...' 新治的目光落在那位身着奇装异服的女孩身上。他完全不了解她的处境，不知道她是否饿了、渴了，或是其他什么情况。但如果夜里的篝火真的熄灭了，那么海风带来的寒意肯定会迅速将他们冻僵。感冒无疑是眼下他最不希望发生的事。

'Water and blankets then,' thought Shinji as he rested his chin in his hand as he looked into the torrent of flames dancing in front of him. As he looked towards the girl, he could see the shadow of the flames flickering off her face. Watching the flames dance across her face for a moment longer, he eventually placed his hands on his knees and pushed himself upwards. Pocketing the lighter which he had placed beside him, he proceeded to venture into the darkened city.  
“那就水和毯子吧。” 碇真嗣一边想着，一边用手托着下巴，凝视着眼前跳跃的火焰洪流。当他望向女孩时，能看到火焰的影子在她脸上闪烁。他又多看了一会儿火焰在她脸上舞动的景象，最终双手撑膝，站起身来。他将放在身旁的打火机揣进口袋，随后踏入了黑暗的城市之中。

Shinji didn't want to walk far; as long as he could see the light of the fire in the distance he wasn't as worried, but the state of the buildings were starting to worry him.  
真嗣并不想走得太远；只要他能看见远处火光的闪烁，他就不那么担心，但建筑物的状况开始让他感到忧虑。

It looked like nuclear fallout had occurred, and every building that he walked by looked as though it had been in a state of disrepair for several years. He did check in several vehicles as he made his way into the city, but didn't find anything he considered useful.  
看起来仿佛发生了核辐射泄漏，他经过的每一栋建筑都像是多年失修的样子。他在进城途中检查了几辆车，但没找到任何他认为有用的东西。

With the lighter in his hand, he passed many stores, most of which didn't seem to even have a scrap of paper left inside it. Whatever had occurred, seemed to have destroyed everything down to the smallest item.  
手中握着打火机，他走过许多店铺，大多数店内似乎连一片纸屑都不剩。无论发生了什么，似乎都将一切摧毁至最微小的物品。

There was one thing that surprised him as he walked around the outskirts of the city, and that seemed that animals were completely unaffected by whatever had happened. As he had passed a car at one point, he saw a dog grabbing something in its mouth, only realizing seconds later that it was a large piece of meat, like the leg of a butchered animal. The dog growled at him however, and Shinji didn't want to press his luck. He may have had the lighter, but he'd rather not get bitten by a wild dog.  
在他漫步于城市边缘时，有一件事让他颇为惊讶，那就是动物们似乎完全不受所发生之事的影响。当他经过一辆车时，看到一只狗正用嘴叼着什么东西，几秒钟后才意识到那是一大块肉，像是屠宰后的动物腿。然而，那狗对他低吼了一声，真嗣并不想冒险。他虽有打火机在手，但更不愿被野狗咬伤。

As the dim light of the fire started to get further and further away, Shinji was just feeling that he was wasting his efforts on something which may not even exist. As he walked past a small store though he turned his head, and paused as he looked into the store. Holding the lighter out in front of himself, he looked past the darkened windows to what was inside.  
随着火光的微弱光芒逐渐远去，真嗣开始觉得自己在为一个可能根本不存在的东西浪费努力。然而，当他走过一家小店时，他转过头，停下脚步向店内望去。他举起打火机照亮前方，透过昏暗的窗户窥视着里面的景象。

The store was better off than most of the others he had passed along the way, and looking at it, Shinji guessed that it had been a sporting goods store of some kind. Carefully walking in between the shattered glass panels of the window, he stepped through the empty window and looked around at the shop.  
这家店铺比他沿途经过的大多数都要好些，环顾四周，真嗣猜测这里曾经是一家体育用品店。他小心翼翼地穿过窗户上破碎的玻璃，跨过空荡荡的窗框，打量着店内。

Most of the shelves were still intact, though with a certain darkened color to the wood, suggesting that it had caught fire. Passing what looked like a twisted cash register, Shinji walked along the aisles peering through the darkness as he did. Twisted pieces of metal, melted rubber, and broken pieces of wood were only some of the things that he passed on his may towards the back of the store. He was hoping to find some sleeping bags, but even that didn't seem very promising.  
大部分货架依旧完好无损，只是木头呈现出一种暗沉的色泽，暗示着它们曾遭受过火灾。经过一个扭曲的收银机，真嗣沿着货架间的小道前行，一边走一边透过黑暗窥视。扭曲的金属片、融化的橡胶和破碎的木块，只是他在前往店铺后部途中所见的一部分景象。他希望能找到一些睡袋，但即便这一点也似乎希望渺茫。

He reached the back of the store, but was met only with a rack of blackened shoes, all too brittle to even pick up. Shaking his head in defeat, he was about to backtrack and head back to the beach when he spotted an employee only sign on a door to the far right of the back wall. He hesitated for a second, thinking things couldn't be much better there than out here but didn't see any reason why he shouldn't at least look. He walked towards to the door and pushed it inwards.  
他来到了商店的后部，却只看到一排烧焦的鞋子，全都脆得连拿起都困难。他无奈地摇了摇头，正准备折返回到海滩时，注意到后墙右侧有一扇门上挂着“员工专用”的牌子。他犹豫了一瞬，心想那里的情况未必比这里好，但又觉得至少应该看看。于是他走向那扇门，推了推。

Except it wouldn't budge.  
然而，门却纹丝不动。

Shinji pushed again, adding more pressure to the door, but even then it wouldn't move an inch. He even tried kicking it, but this was more in frustration than anything.  
真嗣再次用力推门，增加了压力，但门依旧纹丝不动。他甚至尝试踢门，但这更多的是出于沮丧而非实际效果。

With sweat finally starting to run down his cheek, he leaned up against the side of the door and cursed quietly. The roof must have caved in, but if something that could help him did exist back there, he wanted to do everything he could to get it.  
汗水终于开始顺着他的脸颊流下，他靠在门边，低声咒骂。屋顶肯定已经坍塌，但如果那里真的有什么能帮助他的东西，他希望能尽一切可能去获取。

Looking around for something to hit the door with, something perhaps more solid, he spotted a golf club, a driver that hadn't been turned into a chunk of metal. Grabbing it, he walked back over to the door and stood before it with the club held in his hands. Take a few steps back, he lunged forward and swung with all his might against the door. A golf club had certainly never been used like this before. The club made contact with the door and made a large dent in it with a loud hollow sound.  
环顾四周寻找可以用来砸门的硬物，他瞥见了一支高尔夫球杆，一支尚未被砸成金属块的球杆。他抓起球杆，走回门前，双手握住球杆站在那里。后退几步，他猛地向前冲去，用尽全力挥杆击打门板。高尔夫球杆从未被这样使用过。球杆击中门板，发出一声沉闷的巨响，并在上面留下了一个大凹痕。

Stepping back from the door, Shinji swung again, this time cracking the wood and on his third swing, he broke through the wood, creating a sizable hole that he could look through. Throwing the golf club to one side he looked through the hole while holding up the lighter next to him.  
从门前退开，真嗣再次挥杆，这次木门裂开了，第三次挥击时，他打破了木板，制造出一个足够大的洞，可以透过它窥视。他将高尔夫球杆扔到一旁，举起打火机靠近洞口，透过洞口向外张望。

The roof overhead had certainly caved in, and a bunch of the ceiling lay scattered across the room and directly in front of the the door lay several large pieces of wood. But Shinji saw hope in this. He had been afraid that the wood had been piled in front of the door, be he figured that if he swung a few more times at the door, he would be able to push his way through it. He did just that.  
头顶的屋顶确实已经坍塌，一部分天花板碎片散落在房间各处，而门前则横亘着几块大木板。但真嗣在这景象中看到了希望。他原本担心木板会被堆砌在门前，但他推测，只要再多挥几下，就能推开这些障碍。他便如此行动了。

It took ten minutes for him to accomplish this before his hands were blistered and red from clutching the club so tightly, but he finally made it through. Dropping the driver, he pushed his way through the door, wincing slightly as the splinters he had missed dug into his skin and pierced it, making him bleed slightly. He ignored this though, and didn't think anything of it.  
他花了十分钟才完成这一任务，双手因紧握球杆而起泡发红，但最终还是成功了。他丢下球杆，推门而入，那些未被注意到的木刺扎进皮肤，刺痛并让他微微出血，他对此毫不在意，并未多想。

'There better be something worthwhile in this room,' thought Shinji as he waved his lighter around.  
“这房间里最好有值得一看的东西，”真嗣想着，一边挥动着打火机。

The back room seemed to have escaped whatever had vaporized the front room, and a lot of things were still intact. Shinji walked past several shelves, ignoring the many shoe boxes that lined them, searching for anything that could keep them warm tonight.  
后室似乎逃过了前室被蒸发的命运，许多东西都还完好无损。真嗣走过几排货架，对上面堆满的鞋盒视而不见，寻找着今晚能让他们保暖的任何物品。

Passing into another room, the room had caved in on this one as well, but it was worse; part of the wall had caved in as well. Shinji almost all but ignored this room since it was smaller than the previous room which seemed to just be for storing items, but he saw something which made him do a double take. What look the top half of a chair but with its legs snapped off lay on its side amidst the rubble. Walking over to it, he picked it up and held it in his hands.  
穿过另一间房间，这里同样被坍塌的结构所侵占，情况更为严重；部分墙壁也已崩塌。由于这间房比前一间更小，似乎仅用于存放物品，真嗣几乎忽略了它，但他的目光却被某样东西吸引，不禁多看了两眼。那是一把椅子的上半部分，腿已断裂，侧躺在废墟之中。他走过去，拾起它，双手捧着。

"This must have been a break room or something," mumbled Shinji.  
“这以前一定是间休息室之类的，”真嗣喃喃自语。

He now spotted what he had missed before. A small counter ran along one side of the room and what looked like a sink was built into one of the counter tops. Shinji walked up to it and turned on the faucet without much hope. Predictably, not even a drop of water trickled out.  
他现在注意到了之前忽略的东西。房间一侧有一条小吧台，吧台台面上嵌着一个看起来像水槽的东西。真嗣走过去，没抱太大希望地拧开了水龙头。不出所料，连一滴水都没有流出来。

'Should have know better,' he thought. 'But if there is a sink, it wouldn't be too surprising if a small refrigerator was here.'  
"本该更明白的，" 他心想，"但如果这里有水槽，那么有个小冰箱也不足为奇。"

Shinji then started looking around for any speck of white that stood out compared to the grey and brown colors of the wood and roof tiling. It took him some time before he started shifting pieces of wood, looking for any sign of a fridge.  
真嗣开始四处寻找任何一点与众不同的白色，与周围灰褐色的木头和屋顶瓦片形成对比。他花了些时间，才开始挪动木块，寻找冰箱的踪迹。

After moving several medium sized pieces, he finally found it crammed into a corner of the room. It had long ceased functioning, but if Shinji could find water in there, even if it was to last a day, he would be thankful. Tugging open the door, he was met by such a awful smell that it forced him to veer off to the right as he puked.  
在挪动了几件中等大小的物品后，他终于在一个房间的角落里发现了它。它早已停止运转，但如果真嗣能在里面找到水，哪怕只够维持一天，他也会心怀感激。他用力拉开那扇门，迎面而来的恶臭让他不得不向右偏过头去呕吐。

A rat from the looks of it had somehow found itself a way into the fridge and died during the cave in of the roof. The body was twisted and contorted and its fur was already starting to fall off.  
从外表看来，一只老鼠不知怎地找到了进入冰箱的方法，却在屋顶坍塌时丧命。尸体扭曲变形，毛发已经开始脱落。

Shinji hadn't imagined he would have been greeted by something like this, but at least something good had come out of this. Spitting onto the ground, hating the taste of vomit, he looked back into the fridge and stared at the four water bottles in the inside door. Thankfully, the rat was in a far back corner of the fridge so he wouldn't have to go near it. Forcing himself not to puke again, he quickly grabbed the four bottles. Slamming the door closed, he quickly left the room and held his breath until he reached the item storage room before he breathed again.  
真嗣未曾料想会遭遇这样的情景，但至少有件好事从中而来。他朝地上啐了一口，厌恶那呕吐物的味道，回头望向冰箱内门上的四瓶水。谢天谢地，那只老鼠蜷缩在冰箱深处的一角，他无需靠近。强忍着不再呕吐，他迅速抓起那四瓶水。猛地关上冰箱门，他快步离开房间，屏息直至抵达物品储藏室才重新呼吸。

He looked down at the four bottles tucked in his arms and at least thought that it had been worth it in the end. Setting them down on an empty shelf, he looked around the room again. The room seemed to stretch far into the back and he hadn't checked that area yet.  
他低头看着怀里抱着的四瓶酒，至少觉得最终还是值得的。他将它们放在一个空架子上，再次环顾房间。房间似乎向后方延伸得很远，而他还没有检查过那个区域。

He passed an odd assortment of soccer balls and soccer related products before he reached the back of the store. Camping stuff largely littered this area including some fishing poles. Shinji had never been fishing in his life, but supposed that it was something that would be good to learn. He could at least cook whatever he caught. But carrying the fishing poles would be difficult with the bottles also. He'd just have to grab them again at a later date.  
他在抵达店铺后部之前，经过了一系列奇异的足球及周边产品。露营用品主要散落在这个区域，包括一些钓竿。真嗣一生中从未钓过鱼，但他认为这是一项值得学习的好技能。至少他可以烹饪捕获的任何东西。但同时携带钓竿和瓶子会很困难。他只能改天再来取了。

Sifting through some of the other stuff, he saw a bunch of useless camping gear, none of which included a pot or frying pan. The thought of fish had reminded him of how hungry he was.  
他在一堆其他杂物中翻找，发现了一些无用的露营装备，但没有一个是锅或煎锅。想到鱼，他才意识到自己有多饿。

'Well, I found the water at least, so it wasn't too bad I suppose,' sighed Shinji as he stood up and started walking away from the camping goods. He figured that he should start getting back by now. He wanted be sure the fire stayed strong long into the night.  
'好吧，至少我找到了水，所以还不算太糟，我想。' 真嗣叹了口气，站起身来，开始离开露营用品区。他觉得现在应该开始返回了。他想确保火能持续燃烧到深夜。

As he walked past the camping goods though, his eye caught onto something wrapped in plastic that was tucked into a corner. Walking over to it, Shinji pulled it out and realized that it was a dark green sleeping bag. He smiled slightly, but then looked around.  
当他走过露营用品区时，目光被角落里一个用塑料包裹的东西吸引住了。走过去，真嗣把它抽出来，发现那是一条深绿色的睡袋。他微微一笑，但随即环顾四周。

'There's only one,' he thought suddenly.  
“只有一个，”他突然想到。

He stood still for several seconds, his bran registering that phrase. Of course it wouldn't have been that easy.  
他静立了几秒钟，大脑才处理完那句话。当然，事情不会那么简单。

'Damn it,' he thought as he looked around the store again, waving the flickering flame back and forth. As he passed over everything a second time though, he had to admit defeat. He guessed he wouldn't be sleeping much tonight.  
“该死，”他想着，再次环顾店铺，挥动着那摇曳的火光。尽管第二次仔细检查了一遍，他不得不承认失败。看来今晚他别想睡个好觉了。

Walking back to the door he broke through, he carefully placed the sleeping bag through the hole, being sure not to tear it. Next he threw the bottles through and climbed through the hole, ignoring the splinters which pierced his skin again.  
他走回自己破门而入的地方，小心翼翼地将睡袋从洞口塞过去，确保不会撕裂。接着，他把瓶子扔了过去，然后爬过洞口，不顾那些再次刺入皮肤的木刺。

He didn't notice that the cut from earlier had already scabbed over.  
他没有注意到之前的那道伤口已经结痂了。

After returning to the beach, he tossed what he had found from the city in a pile and started stacking more tinder on the fire. It had gone down more than he had suspected and he figured he'd spend most of his night keeping it alive. After getting it back up to a sizable column though, he turned to other matters.  
回到海滩后，他将城市中找到的东西扔成一堆，开始往火堆上添加更多引火物。火势比他预想的要小，他估计自己多半得花上一整夜来维持火种。不过，在重新将其燃成一柱可观的火焰后，他转而处理其他事务。

He had no way of knowing how far off the sunrise was, but had to guess it was getting close to midnight by now. The moon was already high up in the sky and the chilly ocean breeze was starting to hit the beach. Shinji felt himself shiver as he sat in front of the fire. He had always been rather resilient to the cold, so he could manage well enough...but-  
他无从知晓日出还有多久，但估摸着此刻已近午夜。月亮已高悬天际，寒凉的海风开始侵袭沙滩。真嗣坐在篝火前，感到一阵颤抖。他向来对寒冷颇有抵抗力，因此尚能应付...然而——

He looked at the girl across from him on the other side of the fire pit and frowned. From the moment he had gotten the sleeping bag, he knew things would come to this, but he didn't enjoy it anymore. If anything, he hated it even more.  
他看着火坑对面的女孩，皱起了眉头。自从拿到睡袋的那一刻起，他就知道事情会发展到这一步，但他不再感到享受。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是他更加憎恨这种局面了。

Standing up he grabbed one of the water bottles and opened it, letting several drops of water soothe his parched throat. He wanted to be careful with this water in case they may not find anymore for a while. Placing the bottle beside where he had been sitting, he then grabbed the sleeping bag and removed it from the plastic wrap. He unfurled it and let it hang in front of him surprised at how large it actually was.  
他站起身，拿起一瓶水打开，让几滴水滋润他干渴的喉咙。他想要小心使用这些水，以防他们一段时间内找不到更多的水。他把瓶子放在刚才坐的地方旁边，然后拿起睡袋，从塑料包装中取出。他展开睡袋，让它垂在面前，惊讶于它实际上有多大。

Sighing at what he was about to do, he glanced over at the girl, wishing that she would wake up at that moment. But that was just wishful thinking on his part.  
叹息着自己即将要做的事，他瞥了一眼那女孩，希望她此刻能醒来。但那只是他的一厢情愿罢了。

Walking over to her, he knelt down beside her and laid the sleeping bag out, unzipping it and opening it up. Glancing down at her again he paused for several seconds before he took his arm and slid it under her back, his arm digging into the cool sand and gliding across her back. Shinji had been correct in his assumption that her clothes were made out of some strange elastic. He brought his arm upward now, being careful to not jolt her forward suddenly so that her head lulled from side to side. She was oddly heavy for a girl her age, but Shinji attributed this to the fact that she was unconscious. She seemed rather slim as it was. With her now being propped up in a sitting position, Shinji took his other arm and placed it under her thighs before he counted to three, and lifted her gently in the air before setting her down on the warm sleeping bag. He then zipped up the sleeping bag until it was just below her neck and then leaned backwards, letting out a sigh of relief. He had been worried that she may have woken up during the whole ordeal and couldn't imagine things would have gone very well considering what he was doing.  
他走过去，跪在她身边，展开睡袋，拉开拉链并摊开。再次低头看她时，他停顿了几秒，然后伸出手臂，滑到她背后，手臂陷入凉爽的沙子，轻轻拂过她的背。正如真嗣所料，她的衣服是由某种奇特的弹性材料制成。他小心翼翼地抬起手臂，避免突然晃动她的头部，使她的头轻轻摇摆。对于她这个年纪的女孩来说，她异常沉重，但真嗣将其归因于她昏迷不醒。她看起来相当纤细。现在她被扶成坐姿，真嗣用另一只手臂托住她的大腿，数到三后，轻轻将她抬起，放在温暖的睡袋上。接着，他将睡袋拉链拉到她脖子下方，然后向后一靠，松了口气。他担心整个过程中她可能会醒来，考虑到他在做的事情，情况可能不会太好。

Now that she was wrapped in the sleeping bag though, it really seemed that she was sleeping. Her mouth was slightly agape now revealing her white teeth, and Shinji had to look away. He had been very aware of how close he was to her while he had briefly carried her, almost as though she was a baby.  
如今她裹在睡袋里，看起来真的像是睡着了。她的嘴微微张开，露出洁白的牙齿，这让真嗣不得不移开视线。他一直很清楚自己离她有多近，当他短暂地抱着她时，几乎感觉她像个婴儿一样。

'Don't think like that,' Shinji told himself.  
“别这么想，”真嗣对自己说。

Moving away from her, he sat back down on his side of the fire and stared into the flames. Everything that had happened, everything that was going to happen was so distantly removed from Shinji's conscious that he didn't think of anything as he gazed into the fire.  
他离开她，重新坐回火堆自己那边，凝视着火焰。发生的一切，即将发生的一切，都与真嗣的意识如此遥远，以至于他凝视火光时什么也没想。

It was a short time later before he fell asleep.  
不久后，他便睡着了。

Shinji didn't know whether it was the shrill scream, the loud movement of something being dragged across the sand, or that his throat was suddenly being strangled by thin hands that had woken him up. But he did know one thing.  
真嗣不知道是那尖锐的尖叫声、某物在沙地上拖动的巨大声响，还是突然被纤细的手扼住喉咙的感觉唤醒了他。但他确实知道一件事。

The girl was awake. 女孩醒了。

Shinji's eyes flew open as her grasp on his neck tightened, cutting off the much needed oxygen. He hadn't known when he had fallen asleep, but the fire and burned completely out now and the girl seemed to have dragged herself clear across the still smoldering embers. Shinji's eyes squinted as he fought with his brain, willing it to not cause him to pass out as he looked up at the girl choking him. It was the first time he had seen her eyes, and he momentarily forgot that she was trying to kill him. Her eyes were as clear as the sky, as clear as the ocean had once been. Her face was incredibly hard now though, scrunched up in so much anger that it looked like she was going to explode. A dark crease had appeared upon her forehead, and her pupils were wide and shrunken back into her skull. As Shinji continued to stare at her, he realized that tears had started to leak from her eyes.  
碇的眼眸猛然睁开，她的手紧紧扼住他的脖颈，切断了急需的氧气。他不知何时陷入了沉睡，但此刻篝火已完全熄灭，女孩似乎拖着身子穿过了仍在冒烟的余烬。碇眯起眼睛，与大脑抗争，强迫自己不要昏厥，他抬头望着正扼住他咽喉的女孩。这是他第一次见到她的眼睛，那一瞬间他几乎忘记了她正试图置他于死地。她的眼眸清澈如天空，清澈如曾经的海洋。然而她的面容此刻异常坚硬，因愤怒而扭曲，仿佛即将爆发。她的额头上出现了一道深痕，瞳孔放大，深陷于眼窝之中。碇继续凝视着她，意识到泪水开始从她的眼中渗出。

Reality was brought back quickly to him however, as he felt more pressure being put on his neck. She was strong, stronger that he had imagined, and he could feel his vision starting to leave him.  
然而，现实很快将他拉回，因为他感到脖颈上的压力愈发沉重。她比他想象的还要强壮，他能感觉到自己的视线开始模糊。

'Must...do...something,' he thought desperately.  
“必须...做点...什么，”他绝望地想着。

He opened his mouth to try to say something, but his brain wouldn't produce the words properly with the lack of oxygen.  
他张开嘴试图说些什么，但大脑因缺氧而无法正确组织语言。

'Am I...going to die?' he thought as he glanced up at her face stricken with anger.  
“我会...死吗？”他想着，抬头望向她因愤怒而扭曲的脸。

'No...not like this,' he thought suddenly.  
“不……不是这样，”他突然想到。

Forcing his right arm upward, he pressed it roughly into her chest, forcing her backwards and relinquishing the hold on his neck. Taking a quick gulp of air, he turned towards her just in time as she lunged towards him again, reaching for his neck. He batted her hand away this time and took another breathe of air, feeling his entire head spinning with the sudden burst of oxygen. He felt even more like passing out now.  
他强行将右臂向上推，粗暴地按入她的胸口，迫使她后退并松开了对他的颈部束缚。他迅速深吸一口气，就在她再次扑向他、伸手抓向他的脖子时，他及时转身。这次他拍开了她的手，又吸了一口气，突然涌入的氧气让他感到整个脑袋都在旋转。他现在感觉更加晕眩，几乎要昏过去。

Shaking off the feeling he stared back at her who had moved away from him a little now, but was still glaring hatefully at him, her eyes still filled with anger and if Shinji didn't know better, a death glare. He was now wary, not wanting to get up or move at all, so he sat in a sprawled position on the ground.  
他甩开这种感觉，重新看向她，她现在已经稍微远离了他一些，但仍然用充满仇恨的眼神瞪着他，眼中满是愤怒，如果真嗣不了解情况，可能会以为那是死亡凝视。他现在变得谨慎起来，不想起身或移动分毫，于是就那样四肢摊开坐在地上。

The girl glared back at him still; she was crouched in a sitting position, ready incase he decided to run for it. Only problem was, she wasn't confident that she could catch him if he really decided to run. She shifted position a little though, and winced as she did so. Shinji couldn't help but notice this.  
女孩依旧瞪着他，蹲坐在地上，随时准备在他逃跑时追上去。只是问题在于，她并不确信自己能追上他。尽管如此，她还是稍微调整了下姿势，同时疼得皱了皱眉。这一幕被真嗣看在眼里，无法忽视。

He looked where she looked; down around her legs and all the way to her feet were large dark marks, likely the cause of when she had dragged herself across the fire pit. Shinji couldn't imagine the pain from that, but he suddenly thought of something.  
他顺着她的目光看去；她的双腿周围直至脚边，布满了大片深色痕迹，很可能是她拖着自己穿过篝火堆时留下的。真嗣无法想象那有多痛，但突然间他想到了什么。

Standing up, he stood in place for several seconds as he stared back at the girl several paces in front of him. Next second, he took two steps back, and then three steps back. He then turned and looked at the girl and was surprised to see that she hadn't _gotten up_, but was desperately trying to _get up_. She would place both hands on either side of her, and trying pushing her body upward, but her entire lower body didn't seem to want to listen to her.  
他站起身来，目光紧锁前方几步之遥的女孩，静立数秒。下一刻，他向后退了两步，接着又退了三步。随后，他转头望向女孩，惊讶地发现她并未起身，而是拼命想要站起来。她双手分别撑在身体两侧，试图将身体向上推，但她的下半身似乎完全不听使唤。

'Did she injure herself that badly?' thought Shinji. 'Or was the reason she dragged herself across the fire because she couldn't use her legs to begin with?'  
'她伤得那么重吗？' 真嗣心想。'还是说她之所以拖着身子穿过火海，是因为她原本就无法使用双腿？'

Shinji walked several steps backwards again, testing his theory again. The girl seemed to have given up however, and was now attempting to drag herself forward. As she looked up at him however, she seemed to realize that he knew she couldn't chase after him. She glared back at him, her eyes boring into his until her gaze fell and she slowly shifted her legs so that they were in front of him. The were as heavy as lead, but if she touched them, she couldn't feel any sensation.  
真嗣再次后退了几步，再次验证他的猜想。然而，女孩似乎已经放弃了追逐，现在正试图拖着自己向前移动。但当她抬头看向他时，似乎意识到他已经知道她无法追赶上来。她瞪着他，目光如炬，直到视线低垂，她缓缓调整双腿，让它们横亘在他面前。它们沉重如铅，但当她触碰时，却感觉不到任何知觉。

As Shinji watched this pitifulness, he couldn't help but feel sorry for her as she dragged her legs around so she could sit properly. He was even beginning to wish she had just stayed asleep now that she was awake, and apparently wanted to kill him for some reason.  
当真嗣目睹这一幕可怜兮兮的情景时，看到她费力地拖着双腿以便能端正坐好，他不禁为她感到难过。甚至开始希望她还不如继续睡着，毕竟她现在醒了，还不知为何明显想要杀他。

As the girl finally managed to become comfortable, she redirected her gaze at Shinji as he stood in front of her. She hating this feeling of being completely merciless in front of some stranger she didn't even know. To wake up and find somebody asleep close to her, without knowing anything about them or what they had possibly done. It made her so sick she wanted to puke.  
当女孩终于设法感到自在时，她重新将目光投向站在她面前的真嗣。她讨厌这种在完全陌生的人面前毫无防备的感觉，一个她甚至不认识的陌生人。醒来时发现有人睡在身边，却对他们一无所知，也不知道他们可能做过什么。这让她恶心得想吐。

Shinji watched her silently, his hands at his sides. He was unsure what to do in a situation like this. Having never gotten along well with humans in general, having a girl suddenly try to strangle him to death was a situation he hadn't imagined himself being in.  
真嗣默默地注视着她，双手垂在身侧。他不知道在这种情况下该怎么做。一直以来与人类相处得并不融洽，突然有个女孩试图勒死他，这种情形他从未设想过会发生在自己身上。

'We can't just stay like this forever though,' thought Shinji as he sighed.  
"我们不能就这样永远待下去啊。" 真嗣叹了口气，心想。

Resigning to that fact, he sat down slowly, make sure the girl wouldn't try to go after him as he did this. She seemed to be somewhat surprised that he was sitting down now though, as her eyes widened slightly, but then quickly went back to that death stare.  
无奈接受这一事实，他缓缓坐下，确保女孩不会趁机追上来。她似乎对他此刻坐下的举动有些惊讶，眼睛微微睁大，但很快又恢复了那副死寂的凝视。

They sat across from each other now, both watching each other. The girl had been initially surprised that Shinji hadn't just ran away, letting her die in that undignified way. But instead he had sat down, bringing himself down to her level. That pissed her off even more though; he was pitying her.  
他们现在面对面坐着，彼此凝视。女孩起初对真嗣没有直接逃跑，任由她以那种不体面的方式死去感到惊讶。但他却坐了下来，让自己与她平视。这让她更加恼火；他在怜悯她。

'I have to say something,' thought Shinji. 'But what do I say to this girl who just tried to kill me?'  
'我得说点什么，' 真嗣心想。'但对刚刚试图杀我的这个女孩，我该说什么呢？'

Shinji didn't have a clue what to do, but didn't think this was a time to introduce himself. Looking back at her, he saw that her gaze had switched to her legs. She was examining them slowly, moving her hands over the black burns across her legs and feet. She seemed slightly more calm now as she did this, but Shinji noticed that her right eye kept flickering back to him.  
真嗣完全不知道该怎么办，但觉得现在不是自我介绍的时候。他回头看她，发现她的目光已经转向了自己的双腿。她慢慢地检查着，双手在腿上和脚上的黑色烧伤处来回移动。这样做似乎让她稍微平静了一些，但真嗣注意到她的右眼不时地瞥向他。

'She doesn't trust me,' thought Shinji. He should have expected this somewhat, and rather wished he hadn't fallen asleep.  
“她不信任我，”真嗣心想。他本该预料到这一点的，更希望自己没有睡着。

Though an idea came to him then.  
虽然那时他脑海中闪过一个念头。

Standing up again, the girls head came whipping around as her eyes locked on him, watching his every movement. Shinji watched her calmly before he started walking along in a wide half circle around the right side of her; her head followed him as he walked. Walking in a wide arc, he walked all the way around her to the point that she was desperately trying to look behind her but unable to see without repositioning her body. She stopped though as he came back into her field of wish. In his hands he held two bottles.  
再次站起身，女孩的头猛地转向他，目光紧锁在他身上，观察着他的一举一动。真嗣平静地注视着她，然后开始沿着她的右侧走一个大半圆；她的头随着他的步伐转动。他以一个大弧度绕行，直到她拼命想看向身后却无法在不调整身体的情况下看到。然而，当他重新进入她的视野时，她停了下来。他的手中拿着两瓶水。

Shinji sat down again several paces in front of her and placed both water bottles next to him before he open his and took a draught out of it. The water felt cool as it slid down his throat which was still sore from when she had been choking him. Setting down his bottle, he looked across at her and saw that she wasn't looking at him angrily anymore. Her expression was one of confusion.  
真嗣再次坐下，与她相隔几步之遥，将两瓶水放在身边，然后打开自己的那瓶，喝了一口。水流过他因她之前的窒息而仍感疼痛的喉咙，带来一丝凉意。放下水瓶，他望向她，发现她不再以愤怒的眼神看着他。她的表情充满了困惑。

'What is wrong with her?' wondered Shinji almost somewhat amusedly.  
"'她怎么了？' 真嗣几乎有些好笑地想着。

Shinji waited several more seconds before he picked up the other water bottle he had brought, and rolled it across the sand; the bottle bumped gently into the girls knee. She stared down at it for several seconds, her face a mixture of expressions.  
真嗣又等了几秒钟，然后拿起他带来的另一瓶水，滚过沙地；瓶子轻轻撞到了女孩的膝盖。她低头盯着它看了几秒钟，脸上表情复杂。

"Drink it," said Shinji tonelessly.  
“喝吧，”真嗣面无表情地说。

The girls eyes darted towards him, surprised to hear a human voice. Shinji stared back and nodded his head slowly. The girl looked back down at the water bottle before picking it up in her hands. She looked at the cap for several seconds before determining it hadn't been opened before. Quickly opening it, she took several long swallows, just realizing then how thirsty she was. The water slid down her throat, moistening her lips in the process until she paused and removed the bottle from her lips. She slowly set the bottle down next to her, but didn't remove her grip on the bottle. She looked back at Shinji then, a frown on her face.  
女孩的目光迅速转向他，惊讶于听到人类的声音。真嗣回望着她，缓缓点头。女孩再次低头看向水瓶，然后将其拿起。她盯着瓶盖看了几秒，确认未曾被打开过。迅速旋开瓶盖，她连喝了几大口，这才意识到自己有多渴。水滑过喉咙，滋润着她的双唇，直到她停下，将瓶子从唇边移开。她慢慢将水瓶放在身旁，但并未松开握瓶的手。随后，她再次看向真嗣，眉头微皱。

'Is it really that strange for someone to do something like this?' thought Shinji as he looked back at her. He hadn't really expected to receive words of thanks, but knowing that she could at least talk would have been something.  
"有人这么做真的很奇怪吗？" 真嗣想着，回头看向她。他并没有真的期待听到感谢的话语，但知道她至少能开口说话，也算是件好事。

Ignoring this, he raised his own bottle to lips and was about to take a drink when-  
他对此置之不理，举起自己的瓶子送到唇边，正要喝上一口时——

"Where are we?" asked the girl with a clear voice.  
“我们在哪儿？”女孩用清脆的声音问道。

Shinji looked at her for a second through his raised bottle before he lowered it slowly and looked back at her. She was looking determinedly at him now.  
真嗣透过举起的酒瓶看了她一秒钟，然后慢慢放下酒瓶，再次看向她。她此刻正坚定地注视着他。

Shinji took several seconds to reply until he looked across the beach to the bloodied ocean and said-  
真嗣过了几秒才回答，他望向染血的海岸线，说道——

"Tokyo-3, I think." “第三新东京市，我想。”

His eyes darted back to her as he said this, he saw that her eyes had widened slightly as he said this. Was she equally confused and surprised as he was by this, or did her eyes hold a different meaning?  
他说这话时，目光迅速回到她身上，发现她的眼睛微微睁大了。她是否也像他一样感到困惑和惊讶，还是她的眼神蕴含着不同的含义？

They sat in silence again, sipping there water quietly, but as Shinji quickly noticed, both bottles had almost been emptied already. Looks like he'd be looking for more water before the day ended. So much for saving it.  
他们再次静静地坐着，小口啜饮着水，但正如真嗣很快注意到的那样，两个瓶子几乎都快空了。看来今天结束前他得去找更多的水了。省水的计划算是泡汤了。

"Why is no one here?" asked the girl again.  
“为什么这里一个人都没有？”女孩再次问道。

Shinji turned towards her and replied, "I don't know. You're the only other person I've seen, and I was up in the city for these,' he said as he gestured to the water bottles.  
真嗣转向她，回答道：“我不知道。你是除了我之外唯一见过的人，而我之前在城里就是为了这些。”他说着，指了指那些水瓶。

The girl looked at him for several seconds before she turned away from him. Shinji thought he might have seen her mutter something under her breath, but he couldn't hear what it was.  
女孩盯着他看了几秒钟，然后转过身去。真嗣觉得他可能看到她在低声嘀咕什么，但他没听清内容。

Looking at her legs he couldn't think of anything else to say so he asked, "How are your legs?"  
看着她的双腿，他想不出还有什么可说的，于是问道：“你的腿怎么样了？”

The girl glared back at him for a few seconds, not enjoying the question, but he already knew that she couldn't move, so ignoring it was pointless.  
女孩瞪了他几秒钟，不喜欢这个问题，但他已经知道她动不了，所以无视它是没有意义的。

"I can't move them." “我动不了它们。”

Shinji already knew this, but he still pressed the subject.  
真嗣其实已经知道这一点，但他还是继续追问。

"Were they already like that before you-"  
“在你之前，他们就已经那样了吗？”

Shinji hesitated; he had been about to say before you tried strangling me.  
真嗣犹豫了一下；他本想说在你试图勒死我之前。

"-before you crawled across the fire."  
"-在你爬过火堆之前。"

The girl continued glaring at him, but eventually replied, "They were already like this."  
女孩继续瞪着他，但最终回答道，"它们本来就是这样的。"

Shinji didn't think that pushing this further would do any good. Admittedly though, her being basically crippled was a problem, and he was worried about her legs, but if she didn't want to talk about it, he would just wait. He could understand that, as he certainly had things he didn't want to talk about.  
真嗣不认为继续追问会有什么好处。不过，她几乎瘫痪的状况确实是个问题，他对她的双腿感到担忧，但如果她不想谈，他会耐心等待。他理解这一点，因为他自己也有不想提及的事情。

Shinji stood up then, stretching his body and relieving the tension that was building between them just now. The girl watched him silently as he walked several paces away from her towards the ocean. She let out a small sigh herself then; she had been incredibly nervous since the moment she had awoken.  
真嗣随后站起身来，伸展身体，缓解了刚才两人之间的紧张气氛。女孩默默地看着他走向海边，离她几步之遥。她自己也轻轻叹了口气；自从醒来那一刻起，她就一直非常紧张。

Shinji looked out across the ocean for several more seconds before he walked back to where the girl sat. She watched him as he passed by her and started walking towards the slope to the right of where they had sat. She shifted her body slightly, watching as he climbed the hill and was momentarily thinking that he was walking away, that he had made a decision to leave her when he bent over and picked something up. Several seconds later, he came jogging back down the hill, his arms filled with dry brush.  
真嗣又凝视了一会儿海面，才转身走向女孩坐着的地方。她注视着他从身边经过，开始朝他们所坐之处右侧的斜坡走去。她微微调整了姿势，看着他爬上山丘，心中掠过一丝念头，以为他要离开，决定抛下她，然而他却弯腰捡起了什么。几秒钟后，他抱着一捆干枯的灌木，小跑着下了山坡。

The words 'what are you doing,' were half formed in her mouth before her hand brushed against something. Picking it up, she realized it was a lighter, and understood then what he was doing.  
她刚要开口问“你在做什么”，手却无意间触碰到了什么东西。拾起一看，是个打火机，她这才明白他在做什么。

Shinji walked back several seconds later with his arms full of dried drift wood. Dropping everything on the ground, he was about to look for the lighter when he realized it was in the girls hands. There eyes met, and for several seconds, Shinji was afraid that she wasn't going to give it to him. Silently, he held his hand out asking for it. He knew she must understand what he was doing by now, but was never truly sure whether sure she would give it to him. It took her several seconds until she dropped the lighter in his hands wordlessly.  
几秒钟后，真嗣抱着满怀的干漂流木回来了。他将所有东西扔在地上，正准备找打火机时，才发现它在女孩手里。他们的目光相遇，有那么几秒钟，真嗣担心她不会把打火机给他。他默默地伸出手，示意她递过来。他知道她现在肯定明白他的意图，但始终不确定她是否会给他。她犹豫了几秒钟，终于无声地将打火机放在他手中。

Shinji didn't bother saying thanks, as he knew she had been close to not giving it to him. Was she that unable to trust him?  
真嗣没有费心道谢，因为他知道她差点就没给他。她真的那么不信任他吗？

Lighting the fire quickly, he stood back for several seconds watching as the flames licked the wood. Across from him, the girl stared into the flames.  
他迅速点燃了火，后退几步，注视着火焰舔舐木柴。对面，女孩凝视着火光。

Looking down at her, Shinji thought, 'This is a good a time as any I suppose.'  
低头看着她，真嗣心想，'我想这正是时候吧。'

Sitting down across the fire from her, Shinji placed his hands on his knees and said, "Look...as much as you don't trust me, and I have to say, I don't really trust you either, we seem to be the only two people in the entire city. What I guess I'm trying to say is...we have to at least stay together until we're able to find more people."  
坐在火堆对面，真嗣将双手放在膝盖上，说道：“听着……尽管你不太信任我，我得承认，我对你也没多少信任，但我们似乎是这座城市里仅有的两个人。我想说的是……在我们找到更多人之前，至少得待在一起。”

"And if nobody else comes?" asked the girl, her voice suddenly growing in volume.  
"如果其他人都不来呢？"女孩问道，声音突然提高了。

Shinji was trying to be optimistic, but the way she said that made him pissed off for some reason.  
真嗣试图保持乐观，但她那番话不知为何让他莫名恼火。

"You don't believe anybody else will come?"  
“你不相信还会有人来吗？”

The girl didn't reply, already having spoken her mind.  
女孩没有回答，她已经表达了自己的想法。

Shinji stared back at her for a few seconds, wondering what could possibly have made her so inept in dealing with other people. He wasn't a role model by any means, but he at least did want to survive.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒，心中疑惑究竟是什么让她在与人相处时如此笨拙。他自知绝非榜样，但至少他确实渴望生存。

After several seconds of silence, Shinji finally opened his mouth and muttered, "Shinji...Shinji is my name."  
沉默了几秒后，真嗣终于张开嘴，低声说道：“真嗣……真嗣是我的名字。”

The girl slowly raised her head and looked back at him. Her face was blank as she stared back at him.  
女孩缓缓抬起头，回头望向他。她面无表情地凝视着他。

Her small mouth eventually opened as she replied, "Asuka, is mine."  
她的小嘴终于张开，回答道：“这是明日香的。”

They both looked into the fire for several seconds before Shinji stood up and grabbed the sleeping bag and walked around the fire. The girl, Asuka, watched him as he did this and was momentarily surprised when he handed it to her.  
他们俩都盯着火堆看了几秒钟，随后真嗣站起身，抓起睡袋绕过火堆走去。女孩，明日香，看着他这么做，当真嗣将睡袋递给她时，她一时有些惊讶。

"Wrap yourself in this," Shinji said.  
"用这个把自己裹起来，" 真嗣说道。

Asuka watched his eyes for several seconds, searching for any hint of malicious intent in his eyes, though she couldn't find anything. She didn't really like accepting this from him, but she took it all the same.  
明日香盯着他的眼睛看了好几秒，试图从中寻找一丝恶意，却一无所获。她其实并不喜欢接受他的这份好意，但还是接了过来。

Shinji then walked to where he had been sitting, and bent down and grabbed the lighter before he stood up again.  
真嗣随后走向他之前坐的地方，弯腰捡起打火机，然后再次站直身子。

"Though it is still early in the morning, I'm going to enter the city again. By tonight both water bottles will be gone and I can search in daylight better than night anyways."  
虽然清晨尚早，我打算再次进城。到今晚，两个水壶的水都将耗尽，无论如何，白天的搜索总比夜晚更有效。

As he started walking towards the slope, Shinji said, "Don't try moving much either. Your legs will recover faster if you let them sit."
当他开始向山坡走去时，信治说："也别试着多动。如果你让它们静静地坐着，你的腿会恢复得更快。"

Asuka was just about to open her mouth and say something though when she stopped herself. What point was there in arguing with him anyway.  
明日香正要张嘴说些什么，却又突然打住了。反正跟他争论又有什么意义呢。

"I'll be back in a few hours," said Shinji as he reached the top of the slope and disappeared in a few hours.  
“我几个小时后就回来，”真嗣说着，到达坡顶后便消失了。

'Like I'll believe that,' thought Asuka as she looked into the fire. She had noticed that he had taken the lighter with him.  
'我才不信呢，'明日香一边凝视着火焰一边想。她注意到他已经把打火机带走了。

She slowly wrapped her body in the blanket, even managing to place her legs in them. She remembered when she had woken up, and had at first thought that she was in her bed back home in Germany. Everything had been incredibly warm, but then something, a cold breeze most likely had hit her. She then noticed that she was on sand, and in a sleeping bag. She had looked around and her eyes had quickly snapped to that boy. It was only a few seconds before she was on top of him, trying to break his neck. She wondered why he hadn't brought that up yet.  
她慢慢地用毯子裹住身体，甚至设法把腿也放进去。她记得自己醒来时，起初以为自己躺在德国家里的床上。一切都非常温暖，但随后有什么东西，可能是冷风，吹到了她。她这才注意到自己躺在沙滩上，睡在睡袋里。她环顾四周，目光很快落在了那个男孩身上。仅仅几秒钟后，她就扑到他身上，试图扭断他的脖子。她不知道他为什么还没提起这件事。

'Probably waiting till I fall asleep to do something,' thought Asuka. She shivered at the thought. No, she couldn't fall asleep, not in case he did end up coming back.  
'可能是在等我睡着后搞什么鬼，'明日香心想。想到这里，她不禁打了个寒颤。不，她不能睡着，万一他真的回来了怎么办。

She shifted positions, forcing herself to become less comfortable, but the combination of the sleeping bag and fire were making her eyes start to droop.  
她调整了姿势，强迫自己变得不那么舒适，但睡袋和篝火的组合让她的眼皮开始沉重。

'Can't...sleep,' muttered Asuka.  
'不能...睡，'明日香喃喃自语。

It was moments later when her head drooped onto her chest, and she fell deeply asleep.  
片刻之后，她的头垂落在胸前，深深地进入了梦乡。

It took Asuka several seconds to remember where she was when she awoke, but when she did, she sat bolt upright.  
当明日香醒来时，她花了好几秒钟才想起自己身在何处，但一旦记起，她便猛地坐直了身子。

"Oh...you awake?" "哦...你醒了？"

Her head darted to her left and saw Shinji walking over to the fire, several more pieces of wood in his arms.  
她迅速转向左边，看到真嗣抱着几根木柴走向火堆。

Her mouth opened against her will and she stammered, "You're back?"  
她的嘴不由自主地张开，结巴道：“你回来了？”

"I was gone for several hours and have been back for several, you've just been sleeping this whole time."  
“我离开了几个小时，回来也已经有好几个小时了，你一直都在睡觉。”

Asuka opened her mouth again, but this time clamped it closed and turned towards the fire, but only now realized it was extinguished.  
明日香再次张开了嘴，但这次她紧紧闭上，转向了火堆，却直到此刻才意识到火已经熄灭了。

"No need for a fire right now with the sun as it is," said Shinji.  
“现在太阳这么好，不需要生火。” 真嗣说道。

Asuka looked up into the sky and saw that he was right. The sun was high in the sky, indicating that it was noon or a little after.  
明日香抬头望向天空，发现他说得没错。太阳高悬，表明已是正午或稍晚些时候。

"I found more water," said Shinji as he pointed to several more bottles next to the fire. Asuka stared at these and then back at Shinji, confused by what she was seeing.  
"我找到了更多水，" 真嗣指着火堆旁的几瓶水说道。明日香盯着这些水瓶，又回头看向真嗣，对眼前所见感到困惑。

"Why did you come back?" she eventually asked.  
"你为什么回来？" 她最终问道。

Shinji set the wood down beside the fire pit and then looked at her, a frown on his face.  
真嗣将木头放在篝火旁，然后看着她，脸上带着一丝不悦。

"Why wouldn't I?" “我为什么不会呢？”

Asuka didn't reply, feeling like she would have rather not asked.  
明日香没有回答，感觉自己宁愿没有问出口。

"Its not like I gain anything from leaving you."  
“我离开你又没有什么好处。”

"So you would if you could gain something!" Her voice was suddenly harsh.  
“所以如果有利可图你就会离开！”她的声音突然变得尖锐。

Shinji shook his head and replied, "I didn't say that, and I wouldn't do that."  
真嗣摇了摇头，回答道：“我没那么说，也不会那么做。”

Asuka shut up briefly, but Shinji could tell that she was still seething about this. He couldn't understand this girl.  
明日香短暂地沉默了，但真嗣能感觉到她对此仍怒火中烧。他无法理解这个女孩。

Walking around the other side of the fire pit, he sat down and opened one of the water bottles. Taking several swigs, he set it down and saw that she was staring at him intently. Wiping his mouth he let out a sigh and asked, "Is your leg any better?"  
绕过篝火的另一侧，他坐了下来，打开一瓶水。连喝了几口后，他将水瓶放下，发现她正目不转睛地盯着他。他擦了擦嘴，叹了口气问道：“你的腿好些了吗？”

Asuka ignored him for for a while before she muttered, "No."  
明日香无视了他一会儿，然后低声咕哝道：“不。”

'At least she's talking,' thought Shinji.  
"“至少她开始说话了。”真嗣心想。

"We'll we should at least clean up the burn marks from the cinders."  
"我们至少应该清理一下从煤渣上留下的烧痕。"

Shinji made to stand up, but was quickly rebutted by Asuka.  
真嗣正要站起来，但很快被明日香反驳了。

"Don't bother, I'll do it myself."  
"别费心了，我自己来。"

"With what? You're are not using the water in the bottles to clean those burns."  
"用什么？你不会是用瓶子里的水来清洗那些烧伤吧。"

"Who said I was gonna use those?"  
"谁说我打算用那些？"

"Then what? Ocean water won't help you."  
"那又怎样？海水可帮不了你。"

Asuka paused; she was going to use the water from the ocean.  
明日香停顿了一下；她打算用海水。

"I can deal with the salt."  
我能处理这盐。

"I wasn't talking about that, the ocean isn't...the water is something different, some strange liquid that smells like blood. You can even smell it from here."  
“我不是在说那个，海洋不是……水是另一种东西，某种闻起来像血的奇怪液体。你甚至从这儿都能闻到。”

Now that Asuka thought about it, he was right. She could smell it from here, the stench of LCL fluid. She had become so accustomed to it that she hardly noticed it. But why had the Bay of Tokyo-3 turned to LCL fluid? Or was it just like she had thought when this boy told her they were in the remnants of Tokyo-3?  
现在想来，他说的没错。她从这里就能闻到那股味道，LCL 溶液的恶臭。她已经习惯了，几乎察觉不到。但为什么东京-3 湾会变成 LCL 溶液呢？还是说，就像这个男孩告诉她他们在东京-3 废墟中时她所想的那样？

Letting out a sigh, Asuka grabbed the empty water bottle and threw it at Shinji. "Just fill this with the stuff in the ocean. Who cares what it is."  
叹了口气，明日香抓起空水瓶朝真嗣扔去。“直接用海里的水装满就行了。管它是什么。”

"But it could harm you."  
“但它可能会伤害你。”

'If it could harm me I'd be dead by now,' thought Asuka snidely.  
“如果它能伤害我，我现在早就死了，”明日香尖刻地想道。

"Don't worry about it," said Asuka as she waved him off. "Just get the stuff and I'll do the rest."  
"别担心，" 明日香一边挥手让他离开，一边说。"把东西拿来，剩下的我来搞定。"

Shinji stared at her for several more seconds, wondering why she was so positive that the stuff was fine.  
真嗣又盯着她看了几秒钟，不明白她为什么如此确信那东西没问题。

"Okay," he said eventually.  
"好吧，" 他最终说道。

It took him only a few minutes to fill the bottle when he reached the ocean. It was strange, it felt like sand when he ran his hands through it, but it clearly fit in the bottle as a liquid.  
当他到达海边时，只用了几分钟就装满了瓶子。这很奇怪，当他用手拨弄时，感觉像沙子，但它显然以液体的形式装进了瓶子里。

Taking it back to Asuka, he handed her the bottle and she quickly opened it and spread it on her outstretched leg. She immediately winced.  
他带着瓶子回到明日香那里，递给她，她迅速打开瓶盖，将其涂抹在她伸出的腿上。她立刻皱起了眉头。

"Does it hurt?" asked Shinji.  
“疼吗？” 真嗣问道。

Asuka took a few seconds to reply.  
明日香顿了几秒才回答。

"Yes, but thats because of the salt."  
"是的，但那是因为盐。"

"Salt?" "盐？"

"The salt from the ocean mixed with this stuff."  
海水中的盐分与这种物质混合在一起。

"So thats why it felt like sand," mumbled Shinji.  
“所以才感觉像沙子啊。” 真嗣喃喃自语道。

"Most likely," replied Asuka, 'though several of its other properties probably caused that affect,' she thought silently.  
"很有可能，"明日香回答道，'尽管它的其他特性可能也导致了这种影响，'她默默地想。

It didn't take long for Asuka to clean the burns on her legs; thankfully they weren't that bad, but her legs still wouldn't move.  
没过多久，明日香就清理好了腿上的烧伤；幸好伤势并不严重，但她的双腿依旧无法动弹。

The day passed slowly afterwards and Shinji and Asuka barely talked to each other during this time. Shinji was constantly keeping the fire burning, wanting to keep his mind occupied with something, while Asuka seemed to have been lost in her own thoughts, curled in the warmth of the sleeping bag.  
那天之后，时间过得异常缓慢，真嗣和明日香在这期间几乎没有交谈。真嗣不停地维持着火堆燃烧，试图用忙碌来占据自己的思绪，而明日香似乎沉浸在自己的思绪中，蜷缩在睡袋的温暖里。

The sun began sinking across the ocean eventually and Asuka opened her eyes and turned towards it. Shinji, who had thought she had been asleep turned towards her and was momentarily surprised at how beautiful she looked with the orange and red rays of the sun hitting her face.  
太阳开始缓缓沉入海平线，最终，明日香睁开了双眼，转向夕阳。真嗣原以为她已经睡着了，便也转头看向她，一时间被夕阳橙红的光芒映照在她脸上的美丽模样所惊艳。

"What exactly are we going to do now?" asked Asuka suddenly as she turned back towards the fire.  
“我们现在到底要做什么？”明日香突然转身面向火堆问道。

Shinji didn't know himself, which was the problem. He had been maintaining his sanity be doing everything by the moment, by the minute, and by the hour. If he had to think about the days to come, he wasn't sure what they would do. They couldn't just keep living like this.  
真嗣自己也不知道，这就是问题所在。他一直靠按部就班、分秒必争来维持理智。如果让他考虑未来的日子，他不确定他们会怎么做。他们不能就这样一直生活下去。

Shinji's stomach rumbled then, and he was reminded of his hunger once again. He hadn't found food again today, which was growing to be a problem. If he didn't find any tomorrow...  
那时，真嗣的肚子咕噜作响，再次提醒了他饥饿的感觉。今天他又没找到食物，这逐渐成了个问题。如果明天还找不到...

"I don't know," replied Shinji slowly.  
“我不知道，”真嗣缓缓回答道。

'And here I thought you had a solution to everything,' thought Asuka bitterly. But at the same time, she realized just how worried Shinji was about things, even if he didn't say anything. She supposed that it had been different for him when he had found himself here, all by himself until he found her. But even then he didn't know whether she would awake. If she had been in his position...  
“我还以为你什么问题都有办法解决呢，”明日香苦涩地想着。但与此同时，她意识到真嗣对事情的担忧有多深，即使他什么都没说。她猜想当他独自一人来到这里，直到找到她之前，他的处境一定很不同。但即便如此，他也不确定她是否会醒来。如果她处在他的位置……

"Can I ask you something?" asked Shinji suddenly.  
"我能问你件事吗？" 真嗣突然问道。

"...What?" replied Asuka after a seconds pause.  
"……什么？" 明日香顿了几秒后回答。

"Why did you trying killing me?"  
“你为什么要杀我？”

Asuka had been waiting for this question from him and had been surprised that it hadn't come sooner.  
明日香一直在等他问这个问题，惊讶的是他居然到现在才问。

"How would you have reacted if you were in my place?"  
"如果你处在我的位置，你会怎么反应？"

"...What do you mean?" "...你是什么意思？"

"Waking up without any idea where you were with some boy sleeping across from you."  
“醒来时完全不知道自己在哪里，对面还躺着一个男孩。”

'Isn't choking someone still going too far?' thought Shinji.  
"“掐住别人脖子是不是还是太过分了？”真嗣心想。

Asuka didn't want to spell it out for him though, so she didn't. If he didn't understand what she was getting at, it was better that way. The less he knew about her, the better.  
明日香并不想明说，所以她没有。如果他不明白她的暗示，这样反而更好。他了解得越少，对她越有利。

The sun across the horizon set and in several short hours, a new day would be starting.  
太阳横跨地平线缓缓落下，短短几个小时后，新的一天即将开始。

Asuka rolled over, facing away from the fire and covered herself from head to toe in the sleeping back. The plug suit didn't make sleeping particularly comfortable, but it was something she had wondered about before. She couldn't remember wearing her plug suit or going in for any tests before this all happened. She couldn't really remember much of what she had done during that day was the problem.  
明日香翻了个身，背对着火堆，将整个人从头到脚裹进睡袋里。插入栓服并不适合睡眠，这一点她之前也考虑过。她记不清在这场变故之前是否穿过插入栓服或进行过任何测试。问题在于，她几乎记不起那天自己做了些什么。

Shinji continued sitting in front of the fire, his head resting in his hands. He had gotten a headache sometime during the past hour, and hoped that it would subside sooner or later. He was unwillingly thinking about tomorrow and what it would bring. Asuka's leg didn't seem to be getting any better, so they would have to stay on the beach for a while. If he was honest, he would have preferred to have found a place to stay in the city; at least it would be close to more supplies.  
真嗣继续坐在火堆前，双手托着头。过去的一个小时里，他的头开始隐隐作痛，希望这痛楚能早点消退。他不由自主地思考着明天会带来什么。明日香的腿似乎没有好转的迹象，所以他们还得在海滩上逗留一段时间。老实说，他更希望能找到城市里的落脚点；至少那里离补给更近一些。

Placing more wood onto the fire, he lay down on the cool sand and rolled onto his back so that he was looking up at the sky. It was still hard to comprehend what had happened, since it felt like he had been sitting in a classroom until just a little while ago. But things were as they were.  
往火堆里添了些木柴，他躺在凉爽的沙地上，翻身仰面朝天，凝视着天空。这一切仍难以置信，仿佛不久前他还坐在教室里。但事实就是如此。

It took both Shinji and Asuka a long time to fall asleep that first night that they were together, mainly because both were still a bit wary of the other, but when they finally did, it was almost in unison.  
那第一晚，真嗣和明日香花了很长时间才入睡，主要是因为两人对彼此仍有些许戒备，但当他们最终睡着时，几乎是同时的。

### Chapter 3: Conflict

This chapter has long been in the works but I've finally gotten it done. I don't think I'll be updating again until December when I'll actually have some free time so hopefully this holds everyone over until then.

这部 chapter 已经筹备已久，但我终于完成了。我想在十二月之前不会再更新了，那时我才有真正的空闲时间，希望这段时间大家能耐心等待。

Asuka was the first to wake that next morning, and at first, she almost reacted exactly as she did the previous day.

第二天早上，是明日香第一个醒来，起初，她的反应几乎和前一天一模一样。

Her eyes opened slowly with her eyelashes fluttering softly. She was bundled up warmly in the sleeping bag, but the cold breeze that blew against her exposed face awoke her slowly. She turned to her right, and what remaining drowsiness remained disappeared in an instance. She saw Shinji, or his back to be precise, turned away from her. She might have tried strangling him again if it wasn't for the fact that the fire was still burning heavily in-between them.

她的眼帘缓缓张开，睫毛轻轻颤动。她裹在温暖的睡袋里，但拂过裸露脸颊的寒风逐渐唤醒了她。她转向右侧，残留的睡意瞬间消失。她看到了真嗣，准确地说是他的背影，背对着她。若非两人之间熊熊燃烧的篝火，她或许会再次试图勒住他。

She let out a sigh then and turned away from him; she hated being as helpless as she was.

她随后叹了口气，转过身去；她讨厌自己如此无助。

The sun which had been low on the horizon when Asuka had awoken was now starting to rise in the sky, casting shadows across the water as the sun beat down on the capsized battleships that littered the coastline. Asuka drifted in and out of sleep during this time, but felt restless now. It almost felt like she had been sleeping for years.

当明日香醒来时，太阳还低悬在地平线上，如今已开始升起，阳光洒在倾覆的战舰上，投下斑驳的阴影。明日香在这段时间里时睡时醒，但此刻感到焦躁不安。仿佛她已经沉睡了多年。

She heard movement beside her eventually though, and saw Shinji slowly rising from where he sat. He rubbed his eyes gently as he washed the weariness from his body and sat upright with his legs crisscrossed. Turning towards Asuka, he saw that she was already awake.

她最终听到了身旁的动静，看到真嗣缓缓地从坐着的地方起身。他轻轻揉着眼睛，洗去身体的疲惫，双腿交叉盘坐，挺直了身子。转向明日香，他发现她已经醒了。

"You're awake already?" said Shinji somewhat surprised.

“你已经醒了？”真嗣有些惊讶地说。

Asuka paused for a second before she said, "I've been up for a while."

明日香停顿了一下，然后说：“我已经醒了一会儿了。”

It was Shinji's turn to be silent now. He had thought about it last night, whether she would try anything again like the day before. At least he could trust her to not try killing him again.

轮到真嗣沉默了。他昨晚就考虑过，她是否会像前一天那样再次尝试什么。至少他可以相信她不会再试图杀他了。

"Your legs still the same?" he asked.

“你的腿还是那样吗？”他问道。

Asuka nodded again. 明日香再次点头。

"I see," replied Shinji dejectedly.

"我明白了，" 真嗣沮丧地回答道。

"Well sorry to slow you down," said Asuka, growing haughty suddenly.

"好吧，抱歉拖你后腿了，" 明日香突然变得傲慢起来。

Shinji was rather taken aback by this and replied, "I didn't mean it like that."

真嗣对此感到相当意外，回答说："我不是那个意思。"

"Whatever," grumbled Asuka as she turned away from him, her face creased in anger.

“随它去吧，”明日香咕哝着，转身背对他，脸上满是怒容。

'Why the hell did I get this-'

“我他妈怎么就摊上这事儿了——”

Shinji paused, as he had been thinking something rather rude, though albeit true.

真嗣顿了顿，他刚才想到了些相当粗鲁但确实属实的话。

Standing up, he ignored her past comments and said, "Either way, I don't think we will be able to continue like this."

他站起身，无视她之前的评论，说道：“无论如何，我认为我们不能再这样下去了。”

Asuka shot him a look of pure malice, but Shinji didn't notice. If he thought she would allow him to touch her in any way-

明日香向他投去一记纯粹的恶意目光，但真嗣并未察觉。如果他认为她会允许他以任何方式触碰她——

"I'm sure you're hungry as well," said Shinji finishing his thought. "I mean, I don't know when the last time either of us have eaten, but I know food is more important right now than arguing."

“我敢肯定你也饿了，”真嗣说完他的想法，“我是说，我不知道我们上次吃饭是什么时候，但我知道现在食物比争吵更重要。”

Asuka caught back the words she had been about to throw at him. She had thought that he had about to suggest he carry her into the city, to find a better location or something. Though she didn't want to admit it, she was feeling awfully hungry.

明日香收回即将脱口而出的话语。她原以为他会提议背她进城，找个更好的地方或什么的。虽然她不想承认，但她确实感到非常饿。

"So you'll be going into the city again?" she asked.

“所以你要再次进城吗？”她问道。

"Yeah, in a bit," replied Shinji as he grabbed one of the remaining water bottles and sipped it slowly. "The water wont last much longer either."

“嗯，过会儿再说，” 真嗣回答着，拿起剩下的水瓶慢慢喝了一口。“水也撑不了多久了。”

Asuka frowned at his almost earnestness to leave. Did he want to get away from her that badly?

明日香皱眉看着他几乎急切地想要离开的样子。他真的那么想逃离她吗？

"The weather looks like it'll be worse today, so keep the fire going with the remaining sticks."

"今天天气看起来会更糟，所以用剩下的树枝继续保持火堆燃烧。"

"And if it goes out while your gone?"

"如果我不在的时候火熄灭了呢？"

"Stay warm under the sleeping bag?" Shinji suggested.

"躲在睡袋里保暖？" 真嗣建议道。"

"What a plan," said Asuka as she rolled her eyes.

"真是计划周详啊，" 明日香翻了个白眼说道。

"If you don't wanna contribute, then don't," said Shinji, finally getting fed up with Asuka's attitude.

"如果你不想帮忙，那就别帮，" 真嗣终于受够了明日香的态度，说道。

"And if you think I'm slowing you down, just leave then!" Asuka fired back.

"如果你觉得我拖你后腿，那就直接走人吧！" 明日香回敬道。

'You stupid girl,' thought Shinji angrily.

“你这个笨女孩，”真嗣气愤地想。

"Do what you want then," said Shinji as he started walking away from her.

“随你便吧，”真嗣说着，开始从她身边走开。

Asuka watched him until he was out of earshot before she mumbled, "Asshole."

明日香一直看着他直到听不见声音，才低声骂道：“混蛋。”

Climbing the top of the hill, Shinji briefly looked back at Asuka and saw that she was staring into the depths of the roaring fire. He really couldn't understand why she was being so stuck up. It was like there was a insurmountable wall that she had placed over herself that he couldn't see the top of. But if she was going to be like that...

攀至山顶，真嗣回头瞥了一眼明日香，只见她正凝视着熊熊烈火深处。他实在无法理解她为何如此高傲。仿佛她给自己筑起了一堵看不见顶的高墙。但如果她执意如此...

'Maybe it would be better to just leave her,' Shinji thought for a moment. But could he honestly just leave her to fend for herself? He didn't think so, even if she was being abrasive.

“或许直接离开她会更好，”真嗣思索片刻。但他能真的就这样让她自生自灭吗？他不这么认为，即便她态度尖锐。

Passing by the lonely cars, he started walking further into the city, thinking where he should look for food. By now, he had a walked this part of the city enough to recognize buildings that he had passed before and even had something like a map tucked away in his mind. He knew which buildings he had already searched, which didn't have anything useful, and which seemed completely unhelpful. But each time he entered the city, he kept on pushing further in a little more each time. However, it was only a matter of time until he exhausted what the city had to offer. Things were more dire than he cared to elaborate on.

经过那些孤零零的汽车，他继续向城市深处走去，思考着该去哪里寻找食物。如今，他对这片城区已足够熟悉，能认出之前经过的建筑，甚至脑海中隐约形成了一张地图。他知道哪些建筑已经搜寻过，哪些没有有用的东西，哪些看起来完全无用。但每次进入城市，他都会再深入一点。然而，城市能提供的资源终将耗尽，情况比他愿意细想的还要严峻。

The one thing he hadn't found yet was a supermarket, and that was what he was planning on searching for now.

他至今未找到的，是一家超市，而这正是他现在打算寻找的目标。

Passing the sporting goods store he had found on his first trip into the city, he ventured further into the city. As he went deeper in though, he noticed that the skyscrapers and buildings were different here, in that they seemed to have been destroyed by external reasons. Shinji was puzzled by this as he looked at one tower. The side of it looked almost as though a hand had scooped a large portion of the metal away.

经过他第一次进城时发现的体育用品店，他继续深入城市。然而，随着他越走越远，他注意到这里的摩天大楼和建筑物有所不同，它们似乎因外部原因而被破坏。真嗣看着一座塔楼，感到困惑。塔楼的一侧看起来就像是被一只手挖走了一大块金属。

Passing by this building, he walked down a side street that was littered with small, secondhand shops. Shinji didn't know what he had stumbled upon, but it seemed to be a rougher part of Tokyo-3 then he had ever seen before.

经过这座建筑，他走进了一条满是小二手店的侧街。真嗣不知道自己闯入了什么地方，但这似乎是他从未见过的东京-3 的更为粗犷的区域。

Exiting this side street, he walked out onto a main street, passing by the empty cars as he did. What looked like a convenience store/gas station loomed into his view, and for a moment he was exited. But then he saw the large hole at the front of the store and knew he wasn't getting past that.

离开这条小巷，他走到了一条主干道上，经过那些空无一人的汽车。一家看似便利店兼加油站的建筑映入眼帘，他一时感到兴奋。但随即他看到了店铺前的大洞，知道自己是无法通过那里的。

Walking down the street aways, he spent a few minutes trying to get into a store that seemed promising before he gave up. The front door seemed to have been barred from the inside, and he didn't have anything to break the glass.

沿着街道走了一段，他花了好几分钟试图进入一家看似有希望的店铺，但最终还是放弃了。前门似乎从内部被封死了，而他也没有任何工具可以打破玻璃。

He was starting to wonder if he shouldn't just back track so he didn't get lost though when he spotted a buildings off in the distance, or at least a sign. He stared at it for several seconds before he started walking in its direction. Several other buildings eclipsed its view until he rounded a corner that opened up into a small parking lot.

他开始怀疑自己是否应该原路返回，以免迷路，就在这时，他注意到远处有一座建筑，或者说至少是一个标志。他盯着它看了好几秒，然后开始朝那个方向走去。其他几座建筑遮挡了视线，直到他转过一个拐角，眼前豁然开朗，出现了一个小停车场。

Shinji stood in the empty parking lot for several seconds, before he started making his way to the store at the other end. It wasn't a grocery store per se, more like a store that seemed to sell everything. Whats more, it seemed to be in decent condition. It wasn't large by any means like those large supermarkets you sometimes see at malls, but it would hopefully meet his needs. At least, Shinji hoped this.

真嗣在空荡荡的停车场站了几秒钟，然后才开始向另一端的店铺走去。那并非一家严格意义上的杂货店，更像是一家似乎什么都有卖的店铺。更重要的是，它看起来状况还不错。虽然它绝不像你在商场里偶尔见到的那种大型超市那样大，但希望它能满足他的需求。至少，真嗣是这么希望的。

Walking up to the door, Shinji wasn't at all surprised that it didn't open. The electricity was gone, as it was with every other store in the area. But he wasn't going to accept this. Looking around the parking lot, he spotted some empty shopping carts and hoped this would do the trick. Grabbing one, he ran it right into the door with everything he had, making a long crack appear in the glass. Running at it again, the glass broke in several places this time, and Shinji was able to kick the rest of the glass away and force himself into the store.

走到门前，真嗣一点也不惊讶它没有打开。电力已经中断，就像这一带的其他商店一样。但他并不打算就此罢休。环顾停车场，他发现了一些空购物车，希望这能派上用场。他抓起一辆，使尽全力朝门撞去，玻璃上顿时出现了一道长长的裂痕。再次冲撞，这次玻璃在多处破裂，真嗣得以踢开剩余的碎玻璃，强行进入了商店。

As he stood up, he looked up at the wide ceiling above him, his mouth opened slightly in a gasp. As he walked past the cash registers the lined the front of the store, he stared down the isles at the amount of goods on the shelves. Admittedly, the majority of them didn't seem to be able to help them in anyways. Furniture, toys, kitchen supplies, light fixtures, and garden supplies took up a large portion of the store. Things which Shinji would never need...unless he was building a house, but he didn't see that happening anytime soon.

他站起身，抬头望向宽阔的天花板，嘴巴微微张开，发出一声惊叹。当他走过沿店铺前排列的收银机时，他沿着过道凝视着货架上琳琅满目的商品。诚然，其中大部分似乎都无法对他们有任何帮助。家具、玩具、厨房用品、灯具和园艺用品占据了商店的大部分空间。这些是真嗣永远不需要的东西……除非他在建房子，但他不认为这会很快发生。

As he walked further into the store though, he crinkled his nose as he smelled something foul. It wasn't quite as bad as the rat which he had smelled two days before, but it still made his nostrils flare. As he inched closer towards the smell, he realized what it was. A small sectioned of area of the store appeared to have stocked produce at one point. Now though, without the electricity to keep it cold, it had started rotting rather quickly. Shinji was just thankful that the place didn't seem to stock meat.

然而，当他继续深入商店时，他皱起了鼻子，闻到了一股恶臭。虽然没有两天前闻到的老鼠味那么糟糕，但仍让他鼻孔扩张。随着他慢慢接近那股气味，他意识到那是什么。商店的一小块区域似乎曾经存放过农产品。但现在，由于没有电力保持低温，它已经开始迅速腐烂。真嗣只是庆幸这个地方似乎没有存放肉类。

Walking past the produce he walked down several isles, none of which had anything that he would deem useful, unless he got desperate enough to eat dog food.

他走过农产品区，又穿过了几条过道，没有一样东西是他认为有用的，除非他真的到了不得不吃狗粮的地步。

'This place has produce, but nothing else? Does that even make sense,' he thought. It didn't seem like the place had been picked clean either.

“这个地方有农产品，但其他什么都没有？这合理吗？”他心想。看起来这里也不像是被洗劫一空的样子。

"Was it pointless to even come in here?" asked Shinji to the empty store.

“进来这里还有意义吗？”真嗣对着空荡荡的店铺问道。

As he started walking back towards the entrance of the store though, he spotted something which he was surprised he had missed. Afterall, beside cash registers, there was almost always candy for kids to beg to there parents for.

然而，当他开始走回商店入口时，他注意到一些他之前竟然没发现的东西。毕竟，在收银台旁边，通常总是有糖果供孩子们向父母央求。

Jogging up to cash register he paused and bent over, looking at what he had missed when he had come in.

他小跑向收银台，停下脚步弯腰查看，这才注意到自己刚进来时错过的东西。

Not just candy bars, but several bags of chips lined the sides of the cash registers. Shinji felt his stomach rumbling suddenly, realizing just how hungry he was then. He thought briefly of Asuka then, knowing that no matter how grouchy she was, she couldn't possibly deny food.

不仅仅是糖果棒，还有几袋薯片沿着收银台的两侧排列。真嗣突然感到肚子咕咕叫，意识到自己有多饿。他短暂地想起了明日香，知道无论她有多暴躁，她也不可能拒绝食物。

Grabbing as many candy bars as he could and stuffing them in his pocket, he grabbed two bags of chips each. It would have been nice to find a backpack now to carry everything, but he couldn't complain now he supposed that they had food.

他尽可能多地抓起糖果棒，塞进口袋，又各拿了两大袋薯片。如果能找到一个背包来装所有东西就好了，但他现在不能抱怨，毕竟他们有食物了。

Just as he was about to leave though, he grabbed two more bottles of water that had been in a small refrigerator beside the candy. Stuffing the two bottles in his back pocket, he slowly made his way out of the store.

正当他准备离开时，他抓起了两瓶放在糖果旁边小冰箱里的水。把两瓶水塞进后口袋，他慢慢走出了商店。

As Shinji made his way back down the hill leading to the beach, he saw Asuka curled up in the sleep bag. Thinking that she was sleeping, he walked slower as he neared her, but as she started moving restlessly, forbore all pretenses that he cared whether she was awake or not.

当真嗣沿着通往海滩的小山坡返回时，他看到明日香蜷缩在睡袋里。以为她还在睡觉，他放慢了脚步靠近她，但当她开始不安地动来动去时，他不再掩饰自己是否在意她是否醒着。

Sitting down across the fire from her, he started unloading his pockets just as Asuka slowly sat up and turned towards him. Shinji noticed this, but was still silent, remembering there argument from earlier. Asuka however was the first to speak, mainly because she noticed that Shinji had indeed come back with food.

他坐在火堆对面，开始从口袋里掏东西，与此同时，明日香缓缓坐起身转向他。真嗣注意到了，但依旧沉默不语，回想起他们之前的争吵。然而，明日香率先开口，主要是因为她注意到真嗣确实带回了食物。

"Back already?" “这么快就回来了？”

"You say that like you didn't think I would be back," replied Shinji bluntly.

“你这话说的，好像没想到我会回来似的。”真嗣直截了当地回答。

Asuka narrowed her eyes but didn't say anything.

明日香眯起眼睛，但没有说话。

"Here," said Shinji as he passed her a bag of chips and two candy bars.

"给，" 真嗣说着递给她一袋薯片和两根巧克力棒。

Asuka looked down at them and grimaced.

明日香低头看着它们，皱起了眉头。

"Is this it?" "就这些吗？"

"Sorry I wasn't able to cook you a three course meal. If you don't like it, then don't eat it."

“抱歉没能给你做一顿三道菜的大餐。你要是不喜欢，那就别吃了。”

Asuka mumbled the word asshole under her breath, but didn't say anything. Instead, she silently popped open her bag of chips and silently ate the meager meal. Shinji did likewise, and the two of them lapsed into silence.

明日香低声咕哝了一句“混蛋”，但没有说出口。她默默地打开薯片袋，默默地吃着这顿简陋的晚餐。真嗣也照做了，两人就这样陷入了沉默。

Though Shinji kept thinking.

尽管真嗣一直在思考。

If this was what they were expected to live off of, then was the entire thing hopeless after all? Asuka didn't seem pleased no matter what Shinji brought back, and this only made him feel more miserable. At first, he had been happy that he had someone else to talk to, but Asuka was such an unsociable person, that talking to her was like trying to reason with a rabid dog. They bit you no matter what you did.

如果这就是他们指望赖以生存的东西，那么整件事终究还是无望的吗？无论真嗣带回什么，明日香似乎都不满意，这让他感到更加痛苦。起初，他曾因有人可以交谈而感到高兴，但明日香是个如此不合群的人，与她交谈就像试图与一条狂犬讲道理。无论你做什么，它们都会咬你。

Finishing his own bag of chips and candy bar, he threw the wrapper to the side. If it was the end of civilization, then did it really matter if he littered or not.

吃完自己的那袋薯片和巧克力棒后，他将包装纸随手一扔。如果文明已经走到尽头，那么他是否乱扔垃圾又有什么关系呢。

Asuka seemed to have finished as well, though she threw her wrapper into the fire instead, almost in stark contrast to what Shinji had done. Turning away from him, she wrapped the sleeping bag around herself and blatantly ignored him.

明日香似乎也吃完了，但她将包装纸扔进了火里，与真嗣的做法形成鲜明对比。她转身背对他，裹紧睡袋，公然无视他的存在。

Shinji sat in silence for a while, staring into the fire, though not really seeing it. He was peering through, staring at Asuka's back. If they were indeed the only two people left in the city, or even the world for that matter (though he didn't want to admit that) then weren't they almost forced to work together...to live together. Or did she hate him so much that she would rather die than cooperate? Shinji didn't know, but as things were, they would sooner kill each other than work together.

真嗣沉默地坐了一会儿，凝视着火光，却并未真正看它。他的目光穿透火焰，凝视着明日香的背影。如果他们真的是这座城市，甚至可能是这个世界上仅存的两个人（尽管他不愿承认这一点），那么他们不是几乎被迫要合作...共同生活吗？还是说她恨他到宁愿死也不愿合作？真嗣不知道，但就目前的情况来看，他们宁愿互相残杀也不愿合作。

Against his will, he stood up from where he was sitting, and walked around to Asuka's side. Asuka almost immediately sensed movement, and the covers of the sleeping bag came off in a whirl. Shinji was surprised by this sudden turn in hostility, and even more surprised by what was grasped in Asuka's hand. One of the large sticks that had been used for kindling was grasped in Asuka's hand. Its tip was slightly pointed, and Shinji could only guess how she had gotten it that way.

违背他的意愿，他从坐的地方站了起来，绕到明日香那边。明日香几乎立刻察觉到了动静，睡袋的覆盖物瞬间被掀开。真嗣对这突如其来的敌意转变感到惊讶，更惊讶的是明日香手中握着的东西。一根用于引火的大木棍被明日香握在手中。它的尖端略微尖锐，真嗣只能猜测她是如何弄成这样的。

They both froze in there respective places, both eying each other evenly, waiting for someone to make a move. Shinji didn't have confidence in his own abilities really though, and knew that if things came to blows, he would be the one hurting instead.

他们各自僵在原地，目光平等地对视着，等待着有人采取行动。真嗣对自己的能力并没有太多信心，他知道如果事情发展到动手的地步，受伤的只会是他自己。

Taking several steps back he watched Asuka's eyes follow him slowly, those ocean blue eyes of hers filled with malice. Why was she so unable to trust him?

他后退了几步，观察着明日香的眼睛慢慢跟随他，她那湛蓝如海的眼睛充满了恶意。为什么她就是无法信任他呢？

"Hey...listen-" but Asuka cut him off rudely.

“嘿...听着——”但明日香粗鲁地打断了他。

"I won't hesitate to use this if I have to!"

“如果必要的话，我绝不会犹豫使用这个！”

Shinji knew that she wasn't lying, and didn't want to give her any reason to stab him with it.

真嗣知道她没有撒谎，也不想给她任何理由用它刺伤自己。

"Will you just listen to-"

"你能不能就听我说——"

"You don't have anything to say to me that I care to hear!"

"你没有什么话是我愿意听的！"

"Why are you being like this?"

"你为什么这样对我？"

Asuka clammed up, and seemed unwilling to talk, but Shinji wasn't going to accept this.

明日香闭口不言，显得不愿多谈，但真嗣并不打算就此罢休。

"You don't like me, I don't like you. Okay...fine...whatever. And I know your legs still don't work and I understand that you're frustrated about that."

你不喜欢我，我也不喜欢你。好吧...行吧...随便。而且我知道你的腿还是动不了，我理解你为此感到沮丧。

"How the fuck would you know how I feel!? How the fuck would you understand me!? You don't know anything about me!" yelled Asuka.

"你怎么可能知道我的感受！？你怎么可能理解我！？你对我一无所知！" 明日香吼道。

"I know that you're being stubborn and unreasonable!" Shinji fired back. "But we don't know anything about each other than our fucking names!"

"我知道你在固执和不讲理！" 真嗣反驳道。"但我们除了彼此的名字之外，对对方一无所知！"

"And thats the way it'll stay!"

"那就这样保持下去吧！"

Shinji was so furious at her that he suddenly rose to his feet, which made Asuka tighten her grip on the stick she held. But Shinji's next move surprised her slightly.

"Fine. You want to be like this? Fine! You can die of starvation on this beach for all I care."

"好吧。你想这样是吧？好！你就在这海滩上饿死吧，我才不在乎呢。"

Shinji stormed over to his side of the fire and gathered up the remaining food, the water bottles, and the lighter, and started marching up the side of the hill.

真嗣气冲冲地走到火堆的另一边，收拾起剩下的食物、水瓶和打火机，开始向山坡上走去。

"I'd rather starve than be stuck interacting with a piece of shit like you!" Asuka called back at him. "I hope something falls on you and crushes your lower body."

"我宁愿饿死也不愿和你这种人渣打交道！" 明日香回敬道，"希望有什么东西掉下来砸烂你的下半身。"

"So then I'll understand what you feel like!?"

"这样我就明白你的感受了！？"

"Yeah!" “耶！”

Shinji glared at her with such anger in his eyes that he could feel his entire body shaking. And what else was there? Something else inside him felt like it had snapped. He suddenly wanted to choke the life out of this bitch!

真嗣瞪着她，眼中怒火中烧，以至于他感到全身都在颤抖。除此之外还有什么？他内心深处似乎有什么东西断裂了。他突然想掐死这个婊子！

'I'm not wasting another moment around her!'

"“‘我再也不想在她身边浪费哪怕一刻了！’”

Marching away from the fire, he walked up the slope leading into the city and paused briefly as he reached the top. He looked back down the hill to where Asuka was. She was staring blankly into the fire.

他离开火堆，走上通往城市的斜坡，到达顶端时短暂地停了下来。他回头望向山下，那里是明日香所在的地方。她正茫然地凝视着火光。

'If she thinks she's better off on her own, then I won't waste anymore time on her.'

'如果她认为自己一个人会更好，那我就不再在她身上浪费时间了。'

With that thought, Shinji walked into the city.

带着这样的想法，真嗣走进了城市。

Shinji had little to no trouble navigating his way through the streets that he had become rather accustomed to. Noon had passed and afternoon was starting to set into evening when Shinji decided to take a break. He had been walking for most of the time since he had left the beach, but didn't have any goal in mind. In fact, his mind was entirely blank for the most part. He had walked back to the store he had visited that morning and had grabbed several more bags of chips, but in his daze, had quickly eaten them.

真嗣在熟悉的小巷中穿梭自如，几乎没遇到什么困难。中午已过，午后渐入黄昏，真嗣决定稍作休息。自离开海滩以来，他大部分时间都在行走，却并无明确目标。事实上，他的思绪大部分时间都是一片空白。他走回了早上光顾的那家店，又抓了几袋薯片，但在恍惚中很快就吃完了。

He didn't want to think about it, but his mind always wandered to her. He couldn't help but wonder about her. Surely, if her leg didn't heal in two days, it was very probable that she could die. He tried to push this thought away, put he kept on thinking it would be his fault if she died. On the other hand though, she didn't want him around, loathed him so much that she would rather die alone than together. There was something fundamentally wrong with that logic.

他不想去想，但思绪总是不由自主地飘向她。他忍不住去想她。如果她的腿两天内没有痊愈，她很可能会死去。他试图驱散这个念头，但又不断想着，如果她死了，那将是他的错。另一方面，她并不希望他在身边，她如此厌恶他，以至于宁愿独自死去也不愿与他共度。这种逻辑从根本上就是错误的。

Sitting on the side of the street against a curb, he rested his head in his hands as he stared ahead of him. This side of the city seemed to be heavily destroyed by things that didn't even seem like human weapons. The buildings had large gouges almost scraped out of them.

他坐在街边，背靠路缘石，双手托着头，目光呆滞地望向前方。这座城市的这一侧似乎被一些不像是人类武器的东西严重破坏了。建筑物上有着几乎被刮掉的大块痕迹。

What had happened here in Tokyo-3? The end of the world? Well, something seemed to have caused that ending. And why was it that Shinji's memory was so spotty in this aspect. It was like he had woken up on another planet. Was Asuka's memory missing pieces as Shinji's was, or did she remember everything that had transpired? If she did, then maybe that would explain her attitude. She could even have had something to do with it...maybe...

东京-3 究竟发生了什么？是世界末日吗？嗯，似乎有什么导致了这场终结。为什么真嗣在这方面的记忆如此模糊？感觉就像是在另一个星球上醒来一样。明日香的记忆是否也像真嗣那样缺失了部分，还是她记得所有发生的事情？如果她记得，那么这或许能解释她的态度。她甚至可能与此事有关……也许……

But that didn't make much sense, considering she seemed just as old as Shinji.

但考虑到她看起来和真嗣一样大，这似乎不太合理。

'I shouldn't be thinking of those things, especially if I plan on not returning.'

'我不该去想那些事，尤其是如果我打算不回去的话。'

But could Shinji live with himself if he didn't return? Could he live with her death on his hands. Even so, what if she was the only person alive besides him? What then?

但如果真嗣不回去，他能原谅自己吗？他能承受她死在自己手上的事实吗？即便如此，如果她是除了他之外唯一活着的人呢？那又该如何是好？

'She made her own decision, and I made mine,' thought Shinji.

“她做出了自己的决定，我也做出了我的。” 真嗣心想。

Standing up, he started walking deeper in the destroyed city.

他站起身，开始向这座废墟城市的更深处走去。

At the same time Shinji was taking his break, Asuka was having problems of her own. She didn't know how many hours had gone by since Shinji had left, but the fire had died significantly since then. She had slowly added the remaining sticks and small logs to the fire in increments, but that didn't change the fact that the fire was dying, and that she didn't have anymore kindling. Whats more, she had half a bottle of water left. Though she supposed, if worse came to worse, she could drink LCL fluid. Getting there was an entirely different problem though.

与此同时，真嗣正在休息，而明日香则面临着她自己的问题。她不知道自真嗣离开后已经过去了多少小时，但火势自那时起已大大减弱。她慢慢地将剩余的树枝和小木头分批加入火中，但这并未改变火势正在熄灭的事实，而且她也没有更多的引火物了。更糟糕的是，她只剩下半瓶水。尽管她想，如果情况恶化，她可以喝 LCL 液体。但到达那里完全是另一个问题。

Just as Shinji was thinking the same thing, the thought crossed Asuka's mind that if her legs didn't heal in two days, then she would be in serious trouble if she was left by herself. The amount of energy and exertion that was put into dragging her body across the sand was more than she had expected, and she could respect handicapped people more now. Her energy seemed to drain out of her body quickly, and it didn't help that the food had only made her more hungry.

就在真嗣思考同样的事情时，明日香也想到，如果她的腿两天内没有痊愈，那么如果她独自一人，将会陷入严重的困境。拖着身体穿越沙地所消耗的能量和努力超出了她的预期，现在她更加尊重残疾人了。她的精力似乎迅速从体内流失，而且食物只让她更饿了，这无济于事。

As the fire continued dying until almost only embers remained though, she had to make a decision. Pulling herself out of the comfort of her sleeping bag, she pushed herself upward so that she was in a sitting position. The nearest pieces of drift wood couldn't have been further than twenty feet, but that seemed almost like a mile to her. Steeling herself for the journey, she made several hesitating moves until she forced herself forward, clawing at the sand.

随着火焰持续减弱，几乎只剩下余烬时，她不得不做出决定。她从舒适的睡袋中挣扎出来，用力撑起身体，坐了起来。最近的浮木碎片距离不超过二十英尺，但对她来说却仿佛相隔一英里。她鼓起勇气准备出发，犹豫了几下后，终于强迫自己向前，用双手扒拉着沙子。

No matter how it had happened, Asuka was glad that Shinji wasn't around to see her pitiful state. It was beneath her to be crawling on her stomach like the whore of a pimp. She was a fucking Evangelion pilot after all! The only thing that she was remotely thankful, was that the plug suit was elastic, so that it seemed to repel the sand away from it.

无论这一切是如何发生的，明日香庆幸真嗣不在身边看到她这副可怜的样子。像妓女一样趴在地上，这实在有失她的身份。毕竟，她可是个该死的 EVA 驾驶员！唯一让她略感庆幸的是，插入栓服弹性十足，似乎能将沙子拒之门外。

Her legs were as heavy as lead, but still, she dragged herself forward. After a few minutes of this, her hand clasped the rotted wood and she turned around, and threw it over to the fire. She would need several more of that size if she hoped to keep the fire going. Turning back to the scattered wood, she felt her resolve falter a bit. She couldn't remember the last time she had felt this miserable...not since her days in Germany probably. But she was alive at least, which is more than you could say for her mind during her days with-

她的双腿沉重如铅，但她仍拖着身子向前挪动。几分钟后，她的手抓住了腐朽的木头，转身将其抛入火中。如果希望火继续燃烧，她还需要更多这样的木头。转回散落的木头堆，她感到决心有些动摇。她记不清上一次感到如此悲惨是什么时候了...大概是在德国的日子吧。但至少她还活着，这比她在那段日子里的心境要好得多——

'Don't think about that place,' thought Asuka bitterly. 'I'm passed all that now. I'm my own person.'

'别想那个地方了，'明日香苦涩地想，'那些都过去了。我现在是我自己。'

The pain and the memories would remain though.

痛苦和记忆仍将留存。

Asuka spent several more minutes dragging herself to pieces of dry wood and then flinging them over her head until she decided that enough was enough. Slowly, she started dragging herself back towards the fire pit. By now, her entire body was coated in sweat that was seeping into her eyes.

明日香又花了好几分钟，拖着身子捡拾干木块，然后用力抛向头顶，直到她觉得够了为止。慢慢地，她开始拖着自己返回篝火旁。此时，她全身已被汗水浸透，汗水渗进了眼睛。

The struggle back was even more difficult, and seemed to take even longer. Even though she wasn't cold right now, she knew that if the fire went out, she'd be in trouble. Shinji had taken the lighter with him, and though she was confident she could make a fire without a lighter, her legs wouldn't allow it.

返回的路更加艰难，似乎也更加漫长。尽管现在她并不觉得冷，但她知道如果火熄灭了，她就会有麻烦。真嗣带走了打火机，虽然她自信不用打火机也能生火，但她的双腿却不允许她这么做。

Stacking several of the smaller logs on the fire, she slowly built it up again until it was burning peacefully again.

她将几根较小的木柴堆叠在火上，缓缓地重新点燃，直到火焰再次平静地燃烧起来。

Finished with her work, she rolled over onto her back and rested on the sleeping bag with a hand covering her forehead. Her hair laid splayed out on the cold sand, but she didn't care about that right now. If she could just rest her eyes for a few seconds, then the pain and hurt would hopefully go away...

工作结束后，她翻身仰躺，手搭在额头上，靠在睡袋上休息。头发散落在冰冷的沙地上，但她此刻并不在意。如果只是闭眼小憩片刻，或许疼痛和伤感就会随之消散……

Right? 对吧？

Night had finally descended on Tokyo-3, and still Shinji hadn't found a place to sleep for the night. Pavement wasn't exactly the most comfortable, and for some reason he didn't want to sleep in a car. Even the sand at the beach would feel better than what asphalt could offer him.

夜幕终于降临了东京-3，而真嗣仍未找到过夜的地方。路面绝非舒适的选项，出于某种原因，他也不愿睡在车里。哪怕是沙滩上的沙子，也比沥青地面要舒适得多。

As he thought this, he turned around and stared off towards the beach he had come from. He didn't know how many miles he had walked, or how long it had been, but he had looked behind him at one point and was able to see a thin cloud of smoke lifting into the air as the sun shown through it. At least she was able to keep warm.

正当他思索着这些，他转过身，凝视着来时的海滩。他不清楚自己走了多少英里，也不知已过了多久，但曾有一刻他回头望去，看见一缕轻烟袅袅升空，阳光穿透其间。至少她能取暖了。

Shinji had abandoned thinking of her by her named and simply denoted her as "she." It made things a little easier not having to associate her with anyone he knew. She was simply a stepping stone down whatever path he had started walking on.

真嗣已经不再用她的名字来称呼她，只是简单地称她为“她”。这样让事情变得稍微轻松一些，不必将她与自己认识的任何人联系起来。她不过是他在开始行走的某条路上的一块垫脚石。

'Though the path doesn't seem to be leading me anywhere specific,' thought Shinji as he looked around him.

"'虽然这条路似乎并没有带我到任何特定的地方，' 真嗣环顾四周，心中暗想。

And he couldn't have been more specific.

而他对此再清楚不过了。

Though he didn't know it, he was standing on ground that his feet had once treaded in a not so distant, but forgotten memory. The ground around him looked as though it had been bulldozed into oblivion, and the buildings around were little more than rubble. The bombing and shelling had been the worst in this area, but that wasn't the half of it. If she had come with him, she could have taken one look at the rubble, and guessed what had probably happened. But since Shinji didn't have anything to do with Nerv, he wouldn't have a clue.

尽管他并不知情，他正站在一片曾经踏足的土地上，那是一段不久前却已被遗忘的记忆。四周的土地仿佛被推土机夷为平地，建筑物只剩下残垣断壁。这片区域遭受的轰炸和炮击最为严重，但这还只是冰山一角。如果她与他同行，只需一眼望向废墟，便能猜到可能发生了什么。但既然真嗣与 NERV 无关，他对此一无所知。

Be that as it may, his current path was taking him towards the hills above Tokyo-3, and though they were still far off, Shinji was starting to see them clearer every few feet or so. He was remarkably surprised at how well he was able to see in the dark, and still surprised that he had hardly gotten tired during this journey. His stamina didn't seem like it had once...or maybe he had just never applied himself properly.

尽管如此，他现在的路线正引领他前往东京-3 上方的山丘，虽然还相距甚远，但每走几步，真嗣就能更清晰地看到它们。他对自己在黑暗中能看得如此清楚感到非常惊讶，同时也惊讶于自己在这次旅程中几乎没有感到疲惫。他的耐力似乎不再像从前那样……或者也许他从未真正发挥过自己的潜力。

Pushing onwards, Shinji was starting to think that he may be able to reach the hills before night ended. His water supply wasn't bad, and he still had several bags of chips left. Only problem was when he got to the hills. What then?

继续前行，真嗣开始觉得他或许能在夜晚结束前到达山丘。他的水供应还不错，还剩下几袋薯片。唯一的问题是到达山丘后该怎么办？

He didn't know, but anything would be better than plodding around the city all night and day.

他不知道，但任何事情都比整日整夜在城市里徘徊要好。

Making up his mind, he started walking at a brisker pace, and told himself that he would reach the hills before sun up. That was around the time when she woke from her slumber, her scream echoing in the night.

下定决心后，他加快了步伐，暗自决定要在日出前抵达山丘。那时正是她从睡梦中惊醒，尖叫声划破夜空的时刻。

Whether Shinji heard it or not, he didn't give any motion of turning back.

无论真嗣是否听见了，他都没有表现出任何转身回来的迹象。

Asuka's scream wasn't unbidden, nor was it like her to show such fear so suddenly.

明日香的尖叫并非无缘无故，她也不是那种会突然表现出如此恐惧的人。

She awoke with a start, and was assaulted with such pain in her legs that her mouth opened up and a voice she hadn't heard since she was a kid escaped it. She was screaming in pain. Through the pain though, she remembered a vivid memory which may have been the thing that awoke her. She was back there, back were she never belonged, back in hell. The memory and the pain became too much, and all at once she felt tears streaking down her face. When was the last time she had cried? Years ago? Surely it wasn't in recent years, and she had hardened her resolve since then. But even that could be broken so easily if something stronger shook her.

她猛然惊醒，双腿传来的剧痛让她不由自主地张开嘴，发出自孩提时代以来未曾听过的声音。她在痛苦中尖叫。尽管如此，她记得一个生动的记忆，那可能是唤醒她的原因。她回到了那里，回到她本不该存在的地方，回到了地狱。记忆和痛苦变得难以承受，一瞬间，她感到泪水顺着脸颊流下。她上一次哭泣是什么时候？几年前吗？肯定不是近几年，自那以后她已经坚定了决心。但即便如此，如果有什么更强大的东西震撼了她，那决心也能轻易被打破。

Her legs felt inflamed, like thousands of hot embers had struck them simultaneously. It must have been the exertion from earlier. Her muscles were screaming in pain, and so was she.

她的双腿感觉像是被成千上万的热炭同时击中，火辣辣的。这一定是之前过度劳累的结果。她的肌肉在痛苦中尖叫，她自己也一样。

Asuka bit down on her lips, forcing herself not to be weak, to not let her voice out. If she could beat the pain, she would be fine. But showing weakness...that was unacceptable.

明日香紧咬着嘴唇，强迫自己不要示弱，不要发出声音。如果她能战胜疼痛，她就会没事。但表现出软弱……那是绝对不允许的。

Sitting up, she grabbed one of her legs, and slowly moved it, still bitting down on her lips as she did so. If she screamed, he might hear it, and he would come and-

她坐起身，抓住一条腿，慢慢地移动它，依旧紧咬着嘴唇。如果她尖叫，他可能会听到，然后他会过来——

'Stop it,' Asuka told herself. 'He left and he's not coming back!'

'别再想了，'明日香对自己说。'他走了，不会再回来了！'

Who was he though? Shinji, or-

他到底是谁？真嗣，还是——

"STOP IT!" Asuka screamed, not to her legs, but whatever had happened in her previous life.

“住脑！”明日香尖叫道，不是对着她的双腿，而是对着她前世发生的那些事。

Her chest heaving, her breath shallow, Asuka breathed in angrily, not even seeming to notice that the pain was slowly subsiding. But a new pain was slowly creeping in called reality. Reality of what she was facing, what would happen if her legs didn't get better. She wasn't even sure she could deal with dragging herself forward. The last bottle of water was gone, and there was no way she would be inching near the surf of Tokyo-3.

她的胸膛剧烈起伏，呼吸浅促，明日香愤怒地吸了口气，似乎并未察觉到疼痛正逐渐减轻。但一种新的痛苦正悄然袭来，名为现实。她所面对的现实，如果她的双腿无法好转，将会发生什么。她甚至不确定自己能否承受拖着身体前行的重负。最后一瓶水已经喝完，她绝不会向第三新东京市的浪涛靠近半步。

The pain had disappeared now, and she slowly lay herself back on the sleeping bag. She didn't even bother to check that the fire had died out completely. At that point, she didn't feel like doing anything different.

疼痛此刻已消失无踪，她缓缓躺回睡袋中。她甚至懒得检查火是否已完全熄灭。在那一刻，她觉得什么都不想做，一切如常。

Asuka had always been strong, stubborn, cold of heart, even sometimes ruthless. But not being in control was something she had never experienced in a long time. Having to rely on somebody else...she thought she would rather die than have that happen. Now though, that prospect wasn't looking too bad.

明日香一直坚强、固执、心冷如冰，甚至有时冷酷无情。但失去控制是她许久未曾体验的感觉。不得不依赖他人……她曾以为宁愿死也不愿如此。然而现在，这个前景似乎并不那么糟糕了。

Asuka slept fitfully that night, passing in and out of sleep and being occasionally awoken by her paining legs. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Shinji plodded on his useless walk, not realizing what was happening behind him.

那晚，明日香睡得断断续续，时而入睡时而惊醒，不时被疼痛的双腿所扰。与此同时，城市的另一端，真嗣漫无目的地走着，丝毫未察觉身后发生的一切。

True to his word, Shinji made it to the foothills of Tokyo-3 and just started climbing it when the tip of the sun climbed over the ocean. By the time it was reaching high point in the sky, he had climbed the top of one of the smaller hills and looked out across the city. He allowed himself two hours of sleep, and then was up again.

真嗣信守诺言，抵达了第三新东京市的山脚，当太阳从海平面升起时，他便开始攀登。到了正午时分，他已经登上了其中一座较小的山顶，俯瞰着整个城市。他允许自己小憩两小时，随后便再次起身。

Shinji had decided that this hike was largely to determine what he was dealing with, and get an idea of the state of the city. Though something was nagging at him in the back of his mind.

真嗣决定这次徒步主要是为了了解自己所面对的情况，以及城市的现状。尽管心中总有一丝不安萦绕不去。

All in all, he didn't learn much about the city that he could have guessed from just seeing when he had walked. Much of it was destroyed near the center, but near the beach it seemed more intact. He didn't see any lights coming from the buildings down bellow, so nothing had electricity. But that was a given. Though it may have registered, he didn't think about the lack of smoke coming from the beach.

总的来说，关于这座城市，他能从步行时所见猜测到的大部分信息，实际上并未通过这次探索获得更多。市中心附近损毁严重，但海滩附近似乎保存得较为完好。他没看到下方建筑中有灯光透出，意味着这里没有电力供应。不过这一点也不足为奇。尽管可能有所察觉，但他并未深思海滩上为何没有炊烟升起。

Sitting down in the grass, he popped open a bag of chips and slowly ate them. He had been more careful with them since he had decided to hike up the hill, but that didn't mean he had an infinite supply. He thought that his chance of finding fresh water may be better up here then in the city.

他坐在草地上，打开一袋薯片，慢慢地吃了起来。自从决定徒步上山后，他对这些零食就更加珍惜了，但这并不意味着他有无穷无尽的储备。他觉得在这山上找到淡水的可能性或许比在城市里要大些。

Looking out across the destroyed city, Shinji briefly wondered about his father. His father was something of an enigma to him; he never really understood him, and sometimes even hated him for shuffling him around most of his life. How many places had he lived before coming to Tokyo-3? Shinji didn't know, but guessed it was in the double digits.

眺望着被摧毁的城市，真嗣短暂地想起了他的父亲。父亲对他来说是个谜；他从未真正理解过他，有时甚至因为他将自己一生中的大部分时间都搬来搬去而恨他。在来到第三新东京市之前，他到底住过多少地方？真嗣不知道，但猜测应该是两位数。

Finishing his bag of chips, he threw the bag on the ground and stood up, stretching as he did. He wished he had something like a backpack right about now, but wishing wasn't doing him any good. Instead, he turned his attention to the many hills behind him, stretching out into the distance. Between here and there, he didn't see any sign of water, only a smattering of several houses along the country roads. Out here though, it didn't seem like much had been affected by whatever had destroyed Tokyo-3.

吃完薯片后，他将袋子扔在地上，站起身来伸了个懒腰。他现在真希望有个背包什么的，但光是希望对他没有任何帮助。于是，他将注意力转向身后连绵起伏的丘陵，一直延伸到远方。从这里到那里，他没看到任何水的迹象，只有几座散落在乡间小路上的房屋。不过在这里，似乎没有什么受到摧毁第三新东京市的那种力量的影响。

'I'll probably find more food and water in those houses,' thought Shinji.

“那些房子里可能会有更多的食物和水，”真嗣心想。

With this comforting thought, he started walking down the other side of the hill, while behind him, Tokyo-3 melted in the scenery.

带着这份慰藉，他开始沿着山坡的另一侧行走，而身后的第三新东京市则在景色中渐渐消融。

The pain and the weariness had kept Asuka awake during most of the night, and it was only when the sun rose, that she was finally able to sleep more comfortably. It seemed that her legs weren't paining her as long as she was warm, and it was probably the lack of fire that had spurred the pain.

疼痛和疲惫让明日香整夜难以入眠，直到太阳升起，她才终于能更舒适地入睡。似乎只要身体暖和，她的双腿就不那么痛了，可能正是因为缺乏火源才加剧了疼痛。

She was sitting up now and staring into the dead embers of the fire; her mind was a blank however. How much longer would she last? Another day? Two more? A week? What was the possibility of that even? No food, no water, how long could a human live like that?

此刻她坐起身来，凝视着火堆的余烬；然而她的思绪却一片空白。她还能坚持多久？再一天？两天？一周？这可能性又有多大呢？没有食物，没有水，人能这样活多久？

Asuka shook her head suddenly, trying to clear her thoughts. Thinking like that would only prove worse after all. Her legs weren't hurting right now, so while they were like this, it was best to make the most of the situation.

明日香突然摇了摇头，试图理清思绪。那样想只会让情况变得更糟。她的腿现在并不疼，所以趁现在这样，最好充分利用这个局面。

Still unable to stand up, Asuka swiveled around and grabbed one of the empty water bottles that was next to her. Struggling forward, Asuka crawled her way across the sand as she made her way towards the ocean. She couldn't live long without water, that much was true, and while her leg held out, she planned to make that reality true.

尽管仍无法站起来，明日香转过身，抓住旁边的一个空水瓶。她艰难地向前爬行，穿过沙滩，朝着大海前进。没有水她活不了多久，这是事实，只要她的腿还能撑住，她就打算让这个现实成真。

Again though, crawling across the ground like this brought back bitter memories of home. The filth, the vomit, that entire house had been a cage that she was kept in the first eight years of her life.

然而，像这样在地上爬行，又勾起了对家的痛苦回忆。那肮脏、呕吐物，整个房子在她生命的前八年里就像一个囚笼。

'And yet this is still somehow better,' laughed Asuka internally. This somewhat brought her spirits up slightly, and she continued moving forward at a faster pace.

'然而这不知怎的竟变得更好了，'明日香内心笑道。这多少让她精神振奋了些，她加快步伐继续前行。

As she neared the ocean, she could feel the spray hit her face as the wind whipped her hair around. Briefly, she rested and enjoyed the feel of the cool morning air as it struck her face, but she quickly returned to the matter at hand.

当她接近海洋时，可以感受到海风卷起的水花拍打在脸上，她的头发随风飘扬。她短暂地停下脚步，享受着清晨凉爽的空气拂面而来的感觉，但很快又回到了手头的事情上。

Reaching the surf, she laid down just as it swept under her, cooling her sweating back and face as the spray continued hitting her. She placed the back of her hand over her forehead and laughed clearly. She was laughing at whatever had placed her in this situation, laughing that she had defied her fears, laughing that she had beat him again.

到达浪花边，她顺势躺下，海浪正好在她身下冲刷而过，冷却了她汗流浃背的背部和脸庞，水花依旧不断打在她身上。她用手背遮住额头，清晰地笑出声来。她在笑那个将她置于如此境地的人，笑自己克服了恐惧，笑自己再次战胜了他。

"I'm still alive you bastard," said Asuka towards to sky.

“我还没死呢，你这个混蛋。”明日香对着天空说道。

She hadn't laughed at all since she had awoken in the bombed out shelter that was Tokyo-3, but it felt refreshing.

自从她在被炸毁的东京-3 避难所醒来后，她从未笑过，但此刻感觉神清气爽。

Regaining her composure, she turned the bottle that she had held in her hand down towards the LCL fluid and filled it slowly.

她恢复了镇定，将手中的瓶子转向 LCL 液体，缓缓地将其装满。

'I don't think I'll even be able to notice a difference in taste at this point,' thought Asuka as she watched the fluid fill to the rim of the bottle. She had been practicing to be an Eva pilot now for so long that she could drink this stuff like water.

“我想我现在甚至尝不出味道上的差别了，”明日香看着液体慢慢装满瓶口时心想。她已经练习成为 Eva 驾驶员这么久了，现在喝这东西就像喝水一样自然。

Filling the bottle to the top, she capped it and placed it beside her, enjoying this brief moment of rest. The sun beat down on her red hair, turning it a brilliant orange sheen. Basking in the warmth of the sun for a while, she finally decided that it was best for her to head back. Maybe she could even get a fire started at this rate. She was feeling fairly good right now after all. She even forgot that her legs weren't working and even tried standing up. She found that funny for some reason and smiled slightly.

将瓶子灌满后，她盖上盖子，将其放在身旁，享受这片刻的宁静。阳光洒在她红色的发丝上，映出耀眼的橙色光泽。沐浴在温暖的阳光中片刻，她最终决定还是返回为妙。或许她还能趁此机会生起火来。毕竟，此刻她感觉相当不错。她甚至忘记了双腿无法行走，还尝试着站起身来。不知为何，她觉得这颇为有趣，嘴角微微上扬。

Taking several drinks of water from the surf (it really didn't taste any different), she started slowly crawling her way back.

她从浪花中喝了好几口水（其实味道并没有什么不同），然后开始慢慢地爬回岸边。

All too quickly, a sharp pain seared through her legs and made her stop suddenly. She took several large gasps of air, trying to ignore the pain. It would subside if she just waited long enough. Asuka told herself this, but it didn't help to alleviate the pain. Whatever happened though, she couldn't let herself cry like she had last night.

转瞬间，一阵剧痛如火舌般席卷她的双腿，迫使她骤然停下。她大口喘息，试图忽视这痛楚。只要耐心等待，疼痛终会消退。明日香如此自我安慰，却未能减轻丝毫痛感。无论如何，她不能再像昨晚那样任由泪水滑落。

Fighting against the pain she continued moving forward, biting down on her lips until blood flew forth. This helped clear her mind slightly, but the pain was starting to blind her now. How was it that this had happened to her? Was it because of her decision to become an Evangelion pilot? Would she even still be alive if she wasn't one. What had happened to Tokyo-3?

她强忍着疼痛继续前行，咬紧嘴唇直至鲜血四溅。这稍稍让她清醒了一些，但疼痛正逐渐使她失明。这一切是如何发生在她身上的？是因为她决定成为 EVA 驾驶员吗？如果不是，她还会活着吗？第三新东京市又发生了什么？

It took Asuka much longer to get back to the makeshift camp, and we she finally did, she collapsed into a heap of weariness and despair.

阿斯卡了很久才回到临时营地，当她终于到达时，她疲惫不堪地瘫倒在地，充满了绝望。

Many miles away, Shinji was having second guesses about his decision. He had long ago reached the bottom of the valley, but the houses he had been in didn't hold anything significant. He was starting to regret his decision.

在数英里之外，真嗣对自己的决定产生了疑虑。他早已到达山谷底部，但那些房子里并没有什么重要的东西。他开始后悔自己的选择了。

The only upside was that the scenery was at least quite beautiful.

唯一的好处是，至少这里的风景相当美丽。

Shinji had never ventured over the hills before, which made sense, since he hadn't been in Tokyo-3 that long, but he could have imagined himself living here at one point. Even now, he found that idea to be quite pleasant.

真嗣以前从未翻越过这些山丘，这很合理，毕竟他在第三新东京市待的时间并不长，但他曾想象过自己在这里生活的情景。即便现在，他仍觉得这个想法相当美好。

Bring matters back to hand though, he had to think about what to do next.

不过，回到现实，他必须考虑接下来该做什么。

He was sitting on the porch of some forsaken house. He had already been through every room and hadn't found anything except some water in the fridge. He had hoped that the plumbing was still working, but the faucet had been bare. His food was gone now, and he was just starting to get hungry.

他坐在一栋被遗弃的房子的门廊上。他已经搜遍了每个房间，除了冰箱里的一些水，什么也没找到。他本以为水管还能用，但水龙头早已干涸。他的食物已经耗尽，饥饿感正开始袭来。

He had thought that since the houses here hadn't been touched by whatever had befallen Tokyo-3, that they should have plenty of supplies in them. He hadn't thought about the sparsity of these houses in the first place. It wasn't like any small town or anything. Since Tokyo-3 was just over the hill, most people would just drive over it and buy whatever they needed in the city. Out here in the countryside, people only lived here to escape the noise and smell of the city, and that was very few people. All in all, not even fifteen houses filled the green valley.

他原以为既然这里的房屋未受第三新东京市遭遇的任何灾难波及，那么屋内应该储备充足。他未曾考虑到这些房屋的稀少程度。这里并不像任何小镇之类的地方。由于第三新东京市就在山的那一边，大多数人会直接驱车前往城市购买所需物品。在这片乡间，人们居住于此只是为了逃离城市的喧嚣与气味，这样的人寥寥无几。总而言之，绿意盎然的谷地中，连十五栋房屋都填不满。

Shinji kicked his feet absently at the dirt ground bellow him, his legs swinging slightly as they dangled off the porch. What decision would be best now? He was at least two days out from the city, and maybe four from the beach, but going back now didn't seem like something he could bring upon himself. Hadn't he already given up on what was behind him?

真嗣无意识地踢着脚下的泥土，双腿悬在门廊外轻轻晃动。眼下该作何抉择？他离城市至少还有两天路程，或许去海边得四天，但此刻折返似乎并非自己所能承受。难道他不是已经放弃了身后的一切吗？

'Yet you still never met another person while walking here,' a voice told Shinji.

“然而你在这里散步时从未遇到过其他人，”一个声音告诉真嗣。

Maybe that had been another part of it. Deep in the back of his mind, he told himself that if he branched out further, there would be a better chance to find other people that may have survived. But there didn't seem to be anybody else within a fifty mile radius.

也许那只是其中一部分原因。在他内心深处，他告诉自己，如果他走得更远一些，找到其他幸存者的机会可能会更大。但似乎在五十英里的范围内并没有其他人。

'So what was the point of all this then?' he asked himself.

“那么这一切的意义又是什么呢？”他自问道。

'Weren't you just running away again? Isn't that all you ever do?'

'你刚才不是又在逃跑吗？你不就是一直在这么做吗？'

'She forced me into that.'

'是她逼我的。'

'You made the conscious decision to abandon her though.'

'但你还是做出了抛弃她的决定。'

'Like me being there would have made a difference.'

'就像我在那里会有什么不同一样。'

'It did though. Without you, she may have died earlier...she may be dead now though.'

'确实有区别。没有你，她可能早就死了...虽然现在她可能已经不在了。'

No, not that. That was the past. I can't think about things like that if I'm going to survive.

不，不是那个。那是过去的事了。如果我要活下去，就不能再想这些事。

"Survive? With what?" mumbled Shinji.

“生存？用什么？” 真嗣咕哝道。

He didn't have anything except the lighter he had brought, and a lot of good it had done him; he hadn't even bothered making a fire since he had left. He didn't even think he had flicked it on since then.

他除了随身携带的打火机外一无所有，而这打火机对他也没多大帮助；自从离开后，他甚至都没费心去生火。他甚至不记得自那以后是否打开过它。

Bringing it out of his pocket, he flicked it on and watched the flame dance in front of him for several seconds until he flicked it off. He stuffed it back in his pocket and stood up, throwing his arms above him as he reached to the sky. Clouds loomed above him. They weren't exactly dark, but Shinji didn't think it would take much for that to change.

他从口袋里掏出打火机，啪地一声打开，看着火焰在他面前跳动了几秒钟，然后又关掉了。他把打火机塞回口袋，站起身来，双臂向上伸展，仿佛要触摸天空。乌云在他头顶聚集。它们并不算阴沉，但真嗣觉得要变天并不需要太久。

Again, he was having second thoughts, thoughts he couldn't spare to have.

又一次，他开始犹豫不决，这些思绪本是他无暇顾及的。

But- 但是——

"Damn it," grumbled Shinji.

“该死，”真嗣咕哝道。

Which path should he choose? What would be best for him? Was it better to fight on his own, or share it with someone?

他该选择哪条路？什么对他最好？独自战斗更好，还是与他人分担？

'I've never craved human interactions...I've always associated with people as little as possible, but now, I'm being forced into it almost. And though I don't know for certain, I almost feel that it has been the same for her...for Asuka.'

'我从未渴望过人际交往……我一直尽可能少地与人接触，但现在，我几乎是被迫卷入其中。虽然我不确定，但我几乎感觉这对她来说也是一样的……对明日香来说。'

It had been a long time since he had spoken her name, and he was surprised how easily the words came to his lips, almost as they were always there, just waiting to be spoken.

他已经很久没有说出她的名字了，他惊讶于这些话竟如此轻易地脱口而出，仿佛它们一直就在那里，只等着被说出来。

'She hates me, and I hate her. Okay, fair enough, but I don't think we have a choice but to live together for the time being, whether we like it or not.'

'她恨我，我也恨她。好吧，公平合理，但我认为我们别无选择，暂时只能住在一起，不管我们是否愿意。'

Shinji turned his gaze then towards the hill that he had climbed down earlier that day.

真嗣随后将目光转向了那天早些时候他爬下来的那座小山。

'How much of an idiot have I been?' wondered Shinji.

“我到底有多傻？”真嗣心想。

He was afraid to know the truth honestly, as he didn't know what would await him on that beach now.

他害怕诚实地面对真相，因为他不知道现在那片海滩上会有什么在等着他。

'If she's alive...she is...'

'如果她还活着...她就是...'

'And if not?' '如果不是呢？'

Shinji didn't respond, not wanting to think about a what if scenario. If that was true though, and that she had died because of his selfishness, he wouldn't be long for this world either.

真嗣没有回应，不想去设想那种假设性的情景。但如果那是真的，她因他的自私而死去，那么他也不会在这个世界上停留太久。

"If I take short breaks, I should be able to reach her within three days," mumbled Shinji.

"如果我短暂休息，应该能在三天内到达她那里，" 新司喃喃自语。

He didn't see a problem with his stamina, which he hadn't had much of a problem with. It was the water that he was worried about, if only a little.

他并不担心自己的体力，这方面他一直没遇到太大问题。他担心的是水，虽然只是稍微有些担忧。

"It shouldn't become a problem," Shinji told himself before he started retracing his steps to a life he had almost abandoned.

"这应该不会成为问题，" 新司自言自语，然后开始重走他几乎放弃的生活之路。

Asuka didn't wake back up at all the rest of the day, and whether her leg pained her in her fitful sleep, she didn't know. When she did wake up the next day, the dream she had been having hit her.

那天剩下的时间里，明日香再也没有醒来，她不知道在断断续续的睡眠中，腿是否还在疼痛。直到第二天醒来，她才意识到自己做了个梦。

She had been warm, which was a stark contrast to how she felt now. But it was more than that, it had been a memory that she hadn't thought of in a long time. A time before everything had gone wrong. When she had been happy, when her mother was still alive, when her...

梦中她感到温暖，这与她现在的感觉形成了鲜明对比。但这不仅仅是温暖，那是一个久未想起的记忆。在一切出错之前，在她还幸福的时候，在她母亲还活着的时候，在她……

Asuka cut herself off then; she didn't need to be thinking about that first thing in the morning.

明日香随即打住了思绪；她不需要一大早就去想这些。

The warmth though had unfortunately been a lie, and it was probably brought on by the fact that her body itself was unusually cold.

然而，那份温暖不幸地是个谎言，这可能是因为她自身的体温异常寒冷所致。

It took Asuka a few seconds to remember the disastrous attempt at getting water the day before and the assault of pain that had followed. She had slept outside the sleeping bag and only now realized the wetness that covered the sleeping bag. Surprised by this suddenly, she leaned to her left and placed on a hand on the sand; it was wet.

过了几秒钟，明日香才回想起前一天取水的灾难性尝试以及随之而来的剧痛。她睡在睡袋外面，直到现在才意识到睡袋上的潮湿。突然间感到惊讶，她向左倾斜，将手放在沙子上；沙子是湿的。

'Did it rain last night?' wondered Asuka.

“昨晚下雨了吗？”明日香疑惑道。

This seemed to be the most obvious reason, and as Asuka looked at the sleeping bag closer, she noticed that it was soaked as well. She only hadn't noticed it before because she herself was freezing. If not for the plug suit, she would be even more cold she reminded herself. At least it did trap some heat.

这似乎是最显而易见的原因，当明日香更仔细地观察睡袋时，她发现它也湿透了。之前她没有注意到，只是因为她自己也冻得够呛。她暗自提醒，要不是有插电服，她会更冷。至少它确实能留住一些热量。

'Well this sucks,' thought Asuka.

“真是糟透了。”明日香心想。

As if things couldn't get any worse, her legs started to ache. Not terribly, but Asuka guessed that with her body temperature the way it was, it was only a matter of time before it hurt more. The sun at least was high in the sky now, so at most it would warm up eventually.

仿佛事情还不够糟糕，她的双腿开始酸痛。虽然不算剧烈，但明日香猜测，以她目前的体温状况，疼痛加剧只是时间问题。至少现在太阳高挂天空，最终应该会带来些许温暖。

Asuka had only this to look forward to.

明日香只能期待这一点。

Though as the day continued, even that didn't seem to show much promise. Though the sun was in the sky, the ocean breeze that came over the beach was icy and stung her already cold skin.

然而随着时间的推移，就连这一点似乎也显得希望渺茫。尽管阳光普照，海风掠过沙滩时依旧冰冷刺骨，让本已寒冷的皮肤更加难受。

Without anyway to keep warm Asuka was left to turn away from the ocean and let the wind hit her back.

没有任何取暖的办法，明日香只能转身背对大海，任由风打在她的背上。

As day progressed into night, hunger was starting to hit her. The empty water bottle that she had filled yesterday lay empty beside her. Eventually, she had ignored the coldness of the sleeping bag and bundled up inside of it. The combination of her body temperature and cotton of the sleeping bag would get warmer faster instead of being left by itself.

随着白天渐渐转为黑夜，饥饿感开始袭来。昨天装满的水瓶现在空空如也，躺在她身边。最终，她忽略了睡袋的寒冷，蜷缩在里面。她的体温和睡袋的棉质材料相结合，会比单独放置时更快变暖。

Asuka sneezed suddenly and felt a chill go down her spine. Now of all times, was she really getting a cold? There wasn't much she could do about that except bury herself deeper into the sleeping bag.

明日香突然打了个喷嚏，感到一阵寒意直窜脊梁。偏偏在这个时候，她真的要感冒了吗？除了把自己更深地埋进睡袋里，她对此无能为力。

Late into the night, Asuka was awoken by the pain in her legs. It felt like it was on fire...or was the her forehead? She felt cold, but her head was burning hot.

深夜时分，明日香被腿部的剧痛惊醒。那感觉如同烈火焚身，又或是额头在燃烧？她感到寒冷，但头部却滚烫如火。

'A fever?' she thought dazedly.

'发烧了？' 她昏昏沉沉地想。

The coldness was finally starting to do its work on her.

那股寒意终于开始在她身上发挥作用了。

The next day was much the same as the previous. In the morning, Asuka felt slightly better, but as the day began to change to night, the fever and pain of her legs started up quickly. She wasn't sure whether dehydration was a factor in this, but she had started hallucinating. Her dreams were more wild and random now. Half formed images swam in front of her eyes of her dead mother and other people she had known in her short life. Was this how everything was going to end? On the beach of Tokyo-3, freezing to death and dying of starvation and a fever?

次日与前一天并无二致。清晨，明日香感觉稍有好转，但随着白昼渐逝，夜幕降临，高烧与腿部的疼痛迅速袭来。她不确定脱水是否是诱因，但已经开始出现幻觉。她的梦境如今愈发狂野无序，半成形的影像在她眼前浮现，有她已故的母亲，还有她短暂生命中认识的其他人。难道一切就要这样终结吗？在第三新东京市的海滩上，因寒冷、饥饿与高烧而死去？

What could she do though?

但她能做什么呢？

'I wonder what he's doing,' Asuka thought suddenly.

'不知道他在做什么呢，'明日香突然想到。

His face came into her mind then, and held her attention for a brief moment. But no, he was miles away by now, and even if he decided to come back, she'd already be dead by then.

他的面容随即浮现在她脑海中，短暂地吸引了她的注意力。但不行，他现在已远在千里之外，即便他决定回来，那时她也已经不在了。

As Asuka thought this, the weight of what was happening came crashing down on top of her.

当明日香想到这里时，所发生的一切的重压突然间如山崩般压在了她的身上。

She was going to die, it was as simple as that.

她即将死去，事情就是如此简单。

Dying was something that she had somewhat excepted. As an Evangelion pilot, it was something that she had to live with. She knew that, but dying like this was unbefitting of her. Helpless and unable to do anything, she hated herself for this.

死亡对她来说并非完全陌生。作为一名 EVA 驾驶员，她早已习惯了与之共存。她明白这一点，但像这样死去，却与她的身份格格不入。无助且什么都做不了，她痛恨这样的自己。

At the last though, she wouldn't cry. She had already cried once, and that was more the pain than anything, but she wouldn't cry now. She wouldn't give him the satisfaction of that. Even if she was impaled, she wouldn't cry.

尽管心中难过，她却不会哭泣。她已经哭过一次，那更多是因为疼痛而非其他，但现在她不会再哭了。她不会让他因此感到得意。即便被刺穿，她也不会流泪。

She never knew the irony of that thought.

她从未意识到那个想法的讽刺之处。

Sleep came and went that night, and the pain was unrelenting, not giving her a second to think. Her mind felt like it was on fire from the fever, and thinking clearly was nigh on impossible. Her thoughts came and went and her vision was murky from the pain. Her body would cease functioning and everything would be released. She had read during biology that when an animal died, its excrement was released. Was that going to happen to her? Was her body going to be soiled? Would it matter though? She'd be dead after all.

那一夜，睡眠时来时去，痛苦却毫不间断，不给她片刻思考的余地。她的头脑因高烧而如同燃烧，清晰思考几乎成了奢望。思绪飘忽不定，视线因疼痛而模糊。她的身体机能即将停止，一切都将随之释放。她在生物课上读到过，动物死亡时会排出排泄物。这会发生在她身上吗？她的身体会因此受污吗？然而，这又有什么关系呢？毕竟，她终将死去。

Death didn't come that night though, and Asuka was left to suffer through it. If not for the plug suit though, she'd have died sooner she reminded herself.

然而，死亡并未在那一夜降临，明日香只能独自承受这一切。若非有插入栓服的保护，她提醒自己，或许早已命丧黄泉。

The next day dawned, warmer than the previous, but Asuka didn't feel better in the slightest. The sun beat down on her, turning her freezing body burning hot. Her legs still felt cold and dead though, and she was starting to wonder if they hadn't died already.

次日清晨来临，比前一日更为温暖，但明日香丝毫未感好转。阳光炙烤着她，将她冰冷的身体变得滚烫。然而，她的双腿依旧感觉冰冷而麻木，她开始怀疑它们是否已经死去。

Time ceased to matter to her, and every second felt like hours to her. She just wanted it to end already. Take away the pain, then she could rest. At this point, death was almost a welcoming thing to her. Towering over her constantly, stretching its long fingers out to her, she only had to reach out and grasp that reality. What held her back though? Her stubbornness maybe? Her strong will to survive, to never give up, to kick and scream until her body was ripped apart? Was there a point to all this though?

时间对她已无意义，每一秒都如同数小时般漫长。她只希望这一切能快点结束。消除痛苦，她才能得以安息。此刻，死亡对她来说几乎是一种慰藉。它始终高耸在她上方，伸出长长的手指向她，她只需伸手抓住那个现实。然而，是什么阻止了她？或许是她的固执？她强烈的生存意志，永不放弃，直到身体被撕裂也要挣扎和尖叫？这一切还有意义吗？

When did day become night and night become day? When had she realized time was passing again? When did her body stop responding to her demands? When had she stopped caring?

何时白昼变成了黑夜，黑夜又变成了白昼？她何时意识到时间再次流逝？她的身体何时停止了对她命令的响应？她何时停止了关心？

Something within her seemed to go on though, amidst her wishes for everything to end.

尽管她希望一切结束，但内心深处似乎有什么东西仍在继续。

Day did turn into night, and everything was beginning to come to a close. The ocean breeze blew across the sand, sending the tiny crystals across each other. The waves crashed upon one another as the surf stretched towards the beach, its white foam standing out in the darkness.

白昼确实转为了黑夜，一切似乎都即将落幕。海风掠过沙滩，吹动着细小的沙粒相互摩擦。海浪相互撞击，浪花向着海滩延伸，白色的泡沫在黑暗中格外显眼。

Asuka lay still as death inside the sleeping bag. Birds flew above her, landing here and there, curious about the strange shape on the beach. A turtle walked on the beach, oblivious to the ongoing troubles of the teenage girl, lying half dead in the sleeping bag.

明日香静静地躺在睡袋里，宛如死去一般。鸟儿在她上方飞翔，时而落下，对海滩上这个奇怪的形状感到好奇。一只海龟在沙滩上漫步，对躺在睡袋里半死不活的少女的烦恼浑然不觉。

Death had reached out to her.

死亡已向她伸出了手。

An empty white room, devoid of anything greeted Asuka.

一个空无一物的白色房间，没有任何东西迎接明日香。

She was naked. 她一丝不挂。

Death...had called out to her. Had she accepted, or was it simply time? Had her time run out?

死亡...曾向她呼唤。是她接受了，还是时间到了？她的时间已经耗尽了吗？

She didn't move, she just stood in the whiteness. She couldn't think, she couldn't move, she couldn't speak. What was she waiting for?

她没有动，只是站在那片白色中。她无法思考，无法移动，无法说话。她在等待什么？

Something was coming though, she could feel it. She wanted to move forward towards whatever it was. Her feet wouldn't listen to her, much as they had these past days.

但有什么正在靠近，她能感觉到。她想朝那未知之物前进。她的双脚却不听使唤，就像这些天来一样。

Move she told them. 走，她告诉他们。

They didn't. 他们没动。

But the thing got closer...the darkness.

但那东西越来越近了...那片黑暗。

Darkness. Death. Despair.

黑暗。死亡。绝望。

She was afraid now; death was coming for her.

她现在害怕了；死亡正向她逼近。

No, I'm not ready yet.

不，我还没准备好。

Whether she was ready or not, death would reach her; it always found its target.

无论她是否准备好，死亡终将降临；它总能找到目标。

Run! Run! RUN! 跑！跑！快跑！

Her legs still didn't move.

她的双腿依旧动弹不得。

The darkness grew closer. She could now feel the presence of whatever lay waiting for her in the darkness. A hand maybe? A ghastly face? Something...

黑暗愈发逼近。她现在能感觉到黑暗中潜伏着的东西，等待着她的到来。是一只手吗？还是一张骇人的脸？亦或是其他什么...

Or was the darkness something else? Had everything been false? Was she still there? It was always dark there afterall.

或者，黑暗是另一种存在？一切都是虚假的吗？她还在那里吗？毕竟，那里总是漆黑一片。

Even more than death, she didn't want that. Her fears gave way.

比起死亡，她更不希望那样。她的恐惧让步了。

Tears were forming at the corners of her eyes now. She told herself she wouldn't cry though, not ever again.

泪水此刻正在她眼角凝聚。她告诉自己，不会再哭了，再也不会了。

She held them back, afraid for what was to come.

她强忍着，对即将到来的事情感到恐惧。

I don't want this. 我不想要这样。

I want to continue living.

我想继续活下去。

I'm not ready to die.

我还没准备好去死。

Why would death listen though? What reason did it have to care? It was only fulfilling its only design.

但死亡为何要听从呢？它有什么理由去关心？它只是在履行它唯一的设计。

I don't care! 我不在乎！

Neither does death. 死亡亦然。

Something cared though...

但有什么在意着……

A pressure...something on the back of Asuka's shoulders suddenly grabbed her. Not forcefully, but carefully. Startled, Asuka tried turning her head to see what it was, but her head wouldn't move. It was warm though.

一种压力……有什么东西突然抓住了明日香的双肩。不是粗暴地，而是小心翼翼地。明日香惊慌失措，试图转头去看那是什么，但她的头却动弹不得。不过，那触感是温暖的。

The pressure, the weight, was suddenly pulling her backwards. She was tilting downwards now; something was guiding her.

压力，重量，突然间将她向后拉扯。她现在正倾斜向下；有什么在引导她。

A hand? Somebody? Who? 一只手？某个人？是谁？

The darkness rushed towards her now, determined to claim her. If Asuka could have, she would have screamed then, but something stopped her. Though very echoey, a voice filled her mind suddenly.

黑暗此刻向她席卷而来，决心要吞噬她。如果明日香能发出声音，她那时一定会尖叫，但某种力量阻止了她。虽然回声重重，一个声音突然充满了她的脑海。

"Its alright, I've got you."

“没事的，我在这儿。”

Asuka felt herself being pulled backwards now, and felt something wash over her, almost as though she had been pulled through a waterfall. The darkness grew murky then, but it seemed to have stopped, unable to pass through the waterfall as she had.

明日香感到自己正被向后拉扯，一种类似穿越瀑布的感觉涌上心头。黑暗变得混沌，但似乎已停滞不前，无法像她那样穿越那道瀑布。

She was suddenly conscious of her body. Feeling was returning, as was her voice. She turned towards the feeling behind her, that was pulling her onwards. A shape...a human?

她突然意识到自己的身体。感觉正在恢复，声音也是。她转向身后的感觉，那股牵引她前行的力量。一个形状...一个人类？

The whiteness was now disappearing, becoming a tiny dot in the distance. Neither darkness nor light surrounded her, she just existed in empty space along with whatever was pulling her.

那片白色正在消失，变成远处的一个小点。既非黑暗也非光明包围着她，她只是与那股牵引她的力量一同存在于虚空之中。

Something behind her though was growing brighter. Light? Sunlight?

然而，她身后的某物正变得越来越亮。光？阳光？

As she neared the light, everything started to grow clearer.

当她接近那束光时，一切开始变得清晰起来。

Until- 直到——

Light was what she had seen, but it wasn't sunlight.

她所见的是光，但那并非阳光。

Her eyes opened slowly and painfully. Her forehead still burned hot but something was cooling it now. She was on her back, this much she recognized. Everything was painful though, just moving her head took a lot of work.

她的眼睛缓缓地、痛苦地睁开。额头依旧滚烫，但此刻有什么在给它降温。她仰面躺着，这一点她认出来了。尽管如此，一切都疼痛难忍，仅仅是转动头部就费了好大劲。

What she had mistaken for sunlight was a roaring fire though and she was laying right next to it. She was wrapped in the sleeping bag which was now much warmer then she had last remembered it.

她误以为是阳光的，其实是一团熊熊燃烧的火焰，而她就躺在它的旁边。她裹在睡袋里，现在比她记忆中的任何时候都要暖和。

Her eyes roamed around the fire for several seconds, taking everything in.

她的目光在火堆周围徘徊了好几秒，细细打量着四周的一切。

She was alive was she not?

她还活着，不是吗？

As if in response to her question, someone answered her.

仿佛是对她的问题作出回应，有人回答了她。

"Finally awake..." “终于醒了……”

The voice was very hoarse and rough and Asuka barely recognized it. How many days had it been since she had heard that voice?

声音异常沙哑粗糙，明日香几乎没认出来。她已经有多少天没听到这个声音了？

Shinji came into view, walking around the edge of the fire until he was standing several feet in front of her. He had dark shadows under his eyes and he looked much older than the last time she had seen him. Asuka wasn't sure how to respond.

真嗣出现在视野中，他绕着火堆边缘走，直到站在她面前几英尺的地方。他眼底有深重的阴影，看起来比上次见面时苍老了许多。明日香不确定该如何回应。

Shinji looked her over once before he sighed with relief and sat down close to her.

真嗣仔细打量了她一番，然后松了口气，坐到了她身边。

Asuka had several questions floating around in her brain, but she was still too tired to ask any of them.

明日香脑中浮现出许多问题，但她仍然太疲倦，无法开口询问。

She was alive though, and that was enough for her right now.

不过她还活着，这对她来说已经足够了。

Asuka stared into the fire for a long time, ignoring Shinji who sat almost directly next to her. She didn't care about this close proximity...not right now.

明日香长时间凝视着火焰，无视几乎直接坐在她旁边的真嗣。她现在并不在意这种近距离……至少此刻不在乎。

After several long moments though, Asuka felt something brush against her forehead and then the coolness was gone for a second. What replaced it was a warm hand.

然而，过了好一会儿，明日香感觉到有什么东西轻触她的额头，随后那股凉意一闪即逝。取而代之的是一只温暖的手。

"Still have a fever," mumbled Shinji quietly, more to himself than to her. Though Asuka didn't see him, she heard him stand up and walk behind her, his feet crunching as he walked across the sand. Asuka didn't have the energy to even complain about this.

“还在发烧，”真嗣低声咕哝，与其说是对她说的，不如说是自言自语。尽管明日香没看见他，但她听到他站起身，走到她身后，脚踩在沙子上发出嘎吱声。明日香连抱怨的力气都没有了。

After several minutes went by, Shinji came back and lay the piece of cloth against Asuka's forehead, newly soaked in the surf of Tokyo-3. Asuka felt some of the watery LCL fluid drip from the cloth and slide down her cheek. It was certainly cooler than before. Had he been doing this every hour?

几分钟过去后，真嗣回来了，将一块新浸透了东京-3 海浪的布料敷在明日香的额头上。明日香感觉到一些水状的 LCL 液体从布上滴落，滑过她的脸颊。确实比之前凉快了些。他是不是每小时都在这么做？

Shinji went around to the other side of the fire then and grabbed something off the ground that happened to be a water bottle filled with the watery LCL fluid. Bringing it around to Asuka's side he unscrewed the cap and held it in his hands.

真嗣绕到火堆的另一边，从地上捡起一个装满了水状 LCL 液体的水瓶。他拿着它走到明日香这边，拧开瓶盖，握在手中。

Asuka didn't need to be told what he wanted her to do, and she was thankful that he didn't ask. She opened her small mouth and Shinji tipped the water slowly into her mouth, giving her only a mouth full. It helped nonetheless.

明日香无需被告知他希望她做什么，她感激他没有开口询问。她张开小嘴，真嗣缓缓将水倒入她口中，只给她一口的量。尽管如此，这还是有所帮助。

He capped it and stood up, placing it on the other side of the fire. Walking back around the fire, he sat down beside Asuka and rested his head in his hands.

他拧紧瓶盖，站起身来，将其放在火堆的另一侧。绕过火堆走回来，他在明日香身旁坐下，双手托着头休息。

Asuka wanted to know what had happened, how it was that she was still alive, but she figured that could wait for another day. The only thing that she knew right now, was that she was glad Shinji was with her. This puzzled her slightly, but she ignored it, attributing it to the fact that he had saved her life.

明日香想知道发生了什么，她是如何活下来的，但她觉得这可以等到另一天再探究。她现在唯一清楚的是，她很高兴真嗣在她身边。这让她有些困惑，但她没有深究，归因于他救了她一命的事实。

They stayed like that for several minutes, both staring into the fire. Eventually, Shinji stood up and walked to the other side of the fire where he grabbed a water bottle and drank several drops from it.

他们就这样坐了几分钟，两人都凝视着火堆。最终，真嗣站起身，走到火堆的另一边，拿起一个水瓶，喝了几口水。

Finishing he said, "You should sleep if you can. You were through a lot and..."

喝完后他说道：“你应该尽量睡一会儿。你经历了很多……”

Shinji left his sentence dangling, the weariness in his voice apparent. Asuka wanted to tell him to sleep as well, but she had a feeling that he wouldn't. She had a feeling he hadn't gotten much sleep in several days

真嗣的话悬而未决，声音中的疲惫显而易见。明日香想让他也去睡觉，但她有种感觉，他不会去。她有种感觉，他已经好几天没怎么睡了。

Instead, she nodded quietly, and curled back into the sleeping bag, almost like a cat. It was unbelievably warm now with the fire next to her and the sleeping bag covering her.

相反，她静静地点了点头，蜷缩回睡袋里，几乎像只猫一样。现在，火堆旁的温暖和睡袋的覆盖让她感到难以置信的暖和。

Asuka fell asleep peacefully, no longer assaulted by pain or nightmares. She dreamed peacefully that night forgetting everything that had happened the past few days.

明日香安然入睡，不再受疼痛或噩梦的侵扰。那一晚，她平静地做着梦，忘记了过去几天发生的一切。

Across from her, Shinji felt like a giant weight was lifted from his shoulders. Knowing that she was alive and well put his mind at ease. It had been close, but she was alright now.

在她对面，真嗣感到肩上的重担仿佛被卸下了。得知她安然无恙，他的心终于安定下来。虽然情况一度危急，但她现在一切都好。

Letting out a low sigh, he decided he could afford himself two hours of sleep before he had to wake back up and check on her.

他低声叹了口气，决定自己可以奢侈地睡上两个小时，然后再醒来检查她的情况。

Like this, the two of them bonded together. Though they had resented each other, they had been forced to work together in order to survive in this world.

就这样，两人紧密地联系在一起。尽管他们曾彼此怨恨，但为了在这个世界生存下去，他们不得不被迫合作。

### Chapter 4: Connection

Well its New Years Eve, so I got a double post for everybody to read whenever the hangover wears off. These two chapters are to make up for the fact that I didn't get much done between now and my last post (which was back in October). Hopefully we'll see another chapter sometime in January, but again, depends on what happens with my schedule.

既然是新年夜，我给大家准备了双更，可以在宿醉消退时阅读。这两章是为了弥补从现在到我上次更新（那还是十月份的事）之间我完成不多的情况。希望一月份能再看到一篇 chapter，不过这还得看我的日程安排如何。

---

The sun rose on the horizon over the bay of Tokyo-3, piercing Shinji's eyes open. Yesterday had been such a whirl of things happening that he could barely remember getting back. He hadn't gotten much sleep last night, and was feeling extremely tired now. Every bone in his body was aching, but at least the girl sleeping across the fire from him was sleeping peacefully.

太阳在东京-3 湾的地平线上升起，刺眼的阳光让真嗣睁开了眼睛。昨天发生了太多事情，他几乎记不清是怎么回来的。昨晚他没怎么睡，现在感到非常疲惫。全身的骨头都在痛，但至少对面火堆旁的女孩正安详地睡着。

He wasn't sure how he was able to force his body awake every few hours to check on her, but he had someone managed it. Her fever had slowly left her body and she seemed to be feeling better now, but that was just what Shinji could tell from the outside at least.

他不确定自己是怎么做到每隔几小时就强迫身体醒来检查她的，但他确实做到了。她的高烧已慢慢退去，现在看起来感觉好多了，但至少从外表上看，这是真嗣能判断的。

He stood up now and stretched, walking over to the surf to refill his water bottle with the strange fluid. It had a bitter taste to it, but it did quench his thirst at least.

他现在站起身来，伸了个懒腰，走到海边用那种奇怪的液体重新装满水壶。它有一种苦涩的味道，但至少能解渴。

He tried remembering the journey he had taken to get here, but it was such a blur. He had forced himself onward with little sleep to the point that he was afraid he would almost have to start crawling, but his body seemed to bare with the strain. He was puzzled by this immensely, as in all likely hood, he should have probably died of exhaustion. Maybe it was his will that kept him moving forward, but he just wasn't sure.

他试图回忆起自己来到这里的旅程，但那一切都是模糊的。他几乎没有睡觉，强迫自己继续前进，以至于他担心自己几乎要开始爬行，但他的身体似乎承受住了这种压力。这让他感到非常困惑，因为按理说，他很可能已经死于疲劳。也许是他坚强的意志让他继续前进，但他也不太确定。

Walking back to the makeshift camp, he placed more wood on the fire stacking it higher to keep himself and Asuka warm. It didn't seem like it would get too cold like it had two days ago, but he didn't want to take any chances.

走回临时营地，他将更多的木柴加到火堆上，堆得更高以保持自己和明日香温暖。看起来不像两天前那样会变得太冷，但他不想冒任何风险。

Several hours passed by and he continued waiting for her, checking up on her every half hour or so. She was breathing easily now, whereas it had been strained before. He had been worried that she may have come down with pneumonia, but that didn't seem to be the case. At least that was one thing he didn't have to worry about right now. The only problem was she still probably couldn't move her legs, which meant that they where still stuck here for a little longer.

几个小时过去了，他继续等待着她，每隔半小时左右就查看一下她的情况。现在她的呼吸变得轻松了，而之前是有些吃力的。他曾担心她可能得了肺炎，但现在看来并非如此。至少这是他现在不必担心的一件事。唯一的问题是她可能仍然无法移动双腿，这意味着他们还得在这里多待一会儿。

As Shinji was just starting to nod off however, Asuka finally started to stir. She slowly rose to a sitting position, struggling as her feet still refused to obey her commands. The sleeping bag slid off her body, revealing the plug suit clinging to her body and her hair started billowing in the calm sea breeze. The sleepiness left Shinji as he watched her slowly awake and Asuka turned her head to look at him.

然而，正当真嗣快要打瞌睡时，明日香终于开始动了。她慢慢地坐起身来，挣扎着，因为她的双脚仍然不听使唤。睡袋从她身上滑落，露出了紧贴身体的插入栓服和她开始在平静的海风中飘扬的头发。真嗣的睡意消失了，他看着她慢慢醒来，明日香转过头来看着他。

They both looked at each other across the fire and it was Asuka who first spoke.

他们隔着火光对视，最终是明日香率先开口。

"What time is it?" “现在几点了？”

"A few hours before noon I think," replied Shinji evenly. He wasn't sure where there relationship was exactly, but didn't think she would try attacking him again. Not after last night.

"“我想是中午前几个小时吧，”真嗣平静地回答。他不太确定他们之间的关系究竟如何，但觉得她不会再试图攻击他了。至少不会是昨晚之后。”

Asuka was silent again for a few seconds before she asked, "When did you get back?"

明日香又沉默了几秒钟，然后问道：“你什么时候回来的？”

"...I'm not sure," said Shinji slowly. "Sometime last night I know."

"...我不确定，" 真嗣缓缓地说，"应该是昨晚某个时候。"

"I see," mumbled Asuka. She was remembering the vivid dream she had last night, wondering if it had been Shinji who she had seen.

"我明白了，" 明日香喃喃自语。她回想起昨晚那个生动的梦，想知道是否在梦中见到的人就是真嗣。

"How are you feeling?" asked Shinji.

"你感觉怎么样？" 真嗣问道。

"Better I guess, my fever seems like it's gone...my legs still wont move though."

“感觉好些了，我想我的烧退了……不过腿还是动不了。”

'As much as I figured,' thought Shinji.

“正如我所料，”真嗣心想。

Grabbing a nearby water bottle, Shinji walked around the side of the fire and handed it to Asuka. Asuka took it wordlessly, not wanting to admit how thirsty she was, and drank several mouthfuls. Wiping her mouth, she placed the water bottle beside her let out a sigh before looking up at Shinji.

真嗣拿起附近的一瓶水，绕过火堆走到明日香身边递给她。明日香默默接过，不想承认自己有多渴，喝了几大口。她擦了擦嘴，把水瓶放在身边，叹了口气，然后抬头看向真嗣。

"So, where did you go?"

"那么，你去哪儿了？"

Shinji couldn't help but notice the annoyance in her voice, but didn't want to start anything. Replying passively, he said-

真嗣不禁注意到她语气中的不悦，但他不想引发任何争执。他被动地回答道——

"The valley behind Tokyo-3."

"东京-3 后面的山谷。"

Asuka blinked several times, surprised at this answer. How far away was that exactly?

明日香眨了几次眼，对这个回答感到惊讶。那究竟有多远呢？

"Isn't that several miles away?"

“那不是有好几英里远吗？”

"...It is," mumbled Shinji.

“是的，”真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him, surprised that he could still be standing after making that journey. What did he do, run all the way back here?

明日香对他挑了挑眉，惊讶于他在经历了那样的旅程后还能站立。他做了什么，一路跑回来的吗？

'Does it really matter though,' thought Asuka as her gaze dropped the the ground. 'If he hadn't come back, I'd be dead right now.'

'不过，这真的重要吗？'明日香目光低垂，心中暗想。'如果他没有回来，我现在已经死了。'

That thought made her shiver slightly, so she wrapped the sleeping bag around her slightly and moved closer to the fire.

这个念头让她微微颤抖，于是她稍微裹紧了睡袋，向火堆靠近了些。

"And, was there anything worthwhile that you found while over there?"

"那么，你在那边有没有发现什么有价值的东西？"

"No," said Shinji quietly, as he sat down across the fire from her. "Nor, did I see anybody while I was walking to and from. Most likely, we're the only ones in a several mile radius."

"没有，" 真嗣轻声说道，他在火堆对面坐下。"我来回走的时候也没看到任何人。很可能，我们方圆几英里内只有我们两个。"

"Or the entire world for that matter," said Asuka almost to herself.

"或者说整个世界都是如此，" 明日香几乎是自言自语地说道。"

Shinji was silent, wondering about the meaning behind Asuka's words. She was different, no use getting around that fact. She seemed to live in a different world then he did almost.

真嗣沉默了，思索着明日香话语背后的含义。她的确与众不同，这一点无可回避。她似乎生活在一个与他截然不同的世界里。

"Hey...Asuka?" mumbled Shinji after a few seconds pause. Asuka looked back at him slowly, apparently still getting used to hearing him use her name. She couldn't say she liked it, but there wasn't much she could do about it.

“嘿...明日香？”真嗣在几秒钟的停顿后含糊地问道。明日香缓缓回头看向他，显然还在适应他直接叫她的名字。虽然她并不喜欢这样，但也无计可施。

"What?" she replied bluntly.

“什么？”她直截了当地回答。

Shinji hesitated under her glare.

在她的瞪视下，真嗣犹豫了。

"Who...Who are you exactly? I mean...we seem the same age, but..."

“你……你到底是谁？我是说……我们看起来年纪相仿，但是……”

Shinji trailed off, unsure where he was going. It wasn't as if she was an alien of some sort, but he still felt awkward asking her about personal questions.

真嗣话说到一半就停住了，不确定自己想表达什么。她并非什么外星人，但他仍觉得问私人问题很尴尬。

"Who am I?" said Asuka feeling puzzled suddenly. "Are you stupid? I already told you my name!"

"我是谁？" 明日香突然感到困惑。"你傻吗？我已经告诉过你我的名字了！"

"No...I didn't mean like that," replied Shinji hurriedly.

"不...我不是那个意思，" 真嗣急忙回答。

"Then what did you mean moron?"

"那你是什么意思，笨蛋？"

Shinji was having a hard time not raising his voice in reply to her abusive talk, but he held himself back. Now was not the time to be bickering with each other.

真嗣很难不提高声音回应她的辱骂，但他还是忍住了。现在不是互相争吵的时候。

"Well, for instance, the way you're dressed," said Shinji as he pointed at the plug suit she was wearing. "And also what you said before about the water being fit for drinking. How could you know something like that? The water even almost smells like blood."

“比如说，你这身打扮，”真嗣指着她穿的插入栓服说道，“还有你之前说水适合饮用的事。你怎么可能知道那种事？那水甚至闻起来像血一样。”

Asuka glared back at him, not bothering to hide her displeasure about being asked these questions.

明日香瞪着他，毫不掩饰自己被问这些问题的反感。

"Didn't I already tell you that everything would be better off if we didn't know anything about each other?"

“我不是早就告诉过你，如果我们对彼此一无所知，一切都会更好吗？”

"Yeah, well, things have changed a bit since then," replied Shinji, not backing down.

“是啊，不过，从那以后情况有些变化，”真嗣回答道，毫不退让。

Asuka bit her lip. In truth, what Shinji said had merit to it, especially if they were expected to live like this for a while. Some things were better left unsaid however.

明日香咬了咬嘴唇。事实上，真嗣的话不无道理，尤其是如果他们预计要这样生活一段时间的话。然而，有些事情还是不说为妙。

Relaxing somewhat, Asuka reached for the water bottle she had placed earlier beside her and drank several mouthfuls. The LCL fluid reminded of her past in Germany. How many days had she even been in Tokyo-3 before this had happened. It surely couldn't have been more than a week.

稍稍放松下来，Asuka 伸手拿起之前放在身旁的水瓶，喝了几大口。LCL 液体让她想起了在德国的过往。她在东京-3 才待了几天就发生了这种事。肯定不超过一周。

Placing the water bottle beside her again, she took several minutes until she was sitting in front of Shinji with the fire blazing between them before she started talking.

再次将水瓶放在她身旁，她花了好几分钟才坐到真嗣对面，火焰在他们之间熊熊燃烧，随后她才开始说话。

"Do you know what Second Impact is?"

"你知道什么是第二次冲击吗？"

"Er...wasn't that something that happened in Antarctica, and because of that much of the marine wildlife died off?"

"呃...那不是发生在南极的事情吗，因为那次事件，很多海洋生物都灭绝了？"

Asuka didn't say anything for several seconds, gauging her words on how much she should tell him.

绫波没有立即回答，她沉默了几秒钟，斟酌着应该告诉他多少。

"Well, thats the gist of it somewhat. True, marine wildlife has died off except for aquariums and special laboratories that breed them. Second Impact though, is a whole different thing then what the government has led the public to believe. In reality, it was an experiment that went wrong...what the experiment was though, I'm not sure."

"嗯，大致上是这样。确实，海洋生物除了水族馆和特殊实验室培育的之外，已经灭绝了。但第二次冲击，与政府向公众所宣称的完全不同。实际上，那是一场实验出了差错……至于实验的具体内容，我也不清楚。"

"Were you part of this experiment?"

"你参与了这场实验吗？"

"That was like sixteen year ago you moron! I wasn't even born yet!"

"那是十六年前的事了，你这个白痴！我那时还没出生呢！"

"Oh right...sorry," said Shinji hurriedly. He had never been great at history.

"哦对了...抱歉，" 真嗣急忙说道。他对历史一直不太擅长。

It took a while before Asuka was calm again, though when she was, she continued talking.

过了一会儿，明日香才再次平静下来，尽管如此，她还是继续说了下去。

"Anyways, that experiment was part of one large project that was conducted by a company called Gehirn. I don't suppose you've ever heard of it, since its headquartered in Germany, which is where I'm from."

"总之，那个实验是一个名为 Gehirn 的公司所进行的大型项目的一部分。我想你没听说过它，因为它的总部在德国，那也是我出生的地方。"

Shinji blinked several times, not guessing that she was a foreigner, Sure, they red hair was a little strange for someone of Japanese birth, but it wasn't unheard of.

碇真嗣眨了几次眼，没想到她是个外国人。确实，她那头红发对于一个日本人来说有些奇怪，但也不是闻所未闻。

"I didn't even notice," said Shinji to himself.

"我都没注意到," 真嗣自言自语道。

"Notice what?" asked Asuka quickly.

"注意到什么？" 明日香迅速问道。

"No...just that, your Japanese seems flawless, so I didn't even consider the fact that you were foreign."

"不...只是，你的日语听起来毫无瑕疵，所以我都没考虑到你其实是外国人。"

"Hmph, well I took several Japanese classes in college so its natural for me to be well versed in the language."

"哼，我在大学里学过几门日语课，所以精通这门语言是理所当然的。"

Asuka didn't bother to add that she hadn't mastered all the Kanji yet.

明日香没有提及她还没有完全掌握所有的汉字。

"So this company conducted this experiment which led to Second Impact?" asked Shinji.

"所以这家公司进行了这个实验，导致了第二次冲击？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah," nodded Asuka. "My involvement is rather minimal though up until two years ago."

“嗯，”明日香点头道，“不过直到两年前，我的参与程度都很低。”

"Why? What happened?" “为什么？发生了什么？”

There was a pause in Asuka's voice for several seconds here. Two years ago she had been approached by Nerv, now the successor to Gehirn and had learned that her mother had once worked for the company. Immediately she began doing tests of all sorts preparing her for becoming an Eva pilot. But telling all that to Shinji wasn't necessary.

明日香的声音在这里停顿了几秒钟。两年前，她被 NERV——现在的 GEHIRN 继任者——找上门，得知她的母亲曾为该公司工作。随即，她开始接受各种测试，为成为 EVA 驾驶员做准备。但这些事没必要全部告诉真嗣。

"I was asked to come onboard the project because of my thesis I wrote on quantum mechanics and the way the human brain processes thought patterns. I was needed for research so I helped them run some tests. This," said Asuka as she tugged at the plug suit. "It measures human brain waves and thought patterns. I helped develop it."

"我被邀请参与这个项目，是因为我写的关于量子力学以及人类大脑处理思维模式的论文。他们需要我来进行研究，所以我帮他们进行了一些测试。这个，" 明日香说着，拉了拉紧身衣上的插头。"它能测量人类的大脑波和思维模式。我参与了它的研发。"

Shinji was becoming more and more impressed with her, but a few things still hadn't been addressed yet.

真嗣对她的印象越来越深刻，但还有几件事尚未提及。

"What is the orange colored fluid then?"

“那么，橙色的液体是什么？”

"That? Its called LCL fluid. The plug suit and LCL fluid work in conjunction with each other. They place the test subject in a cylinder and pump it full of LCL fluid while they wear the plug suit."

“那个？它叫做 LCL 液体。插头服和 LCL 液体是相互配合的。他们将测试对象放入一个圆柱体内，并在他们穿着插头服的同时注入 LCL 液体。”

"Don't they drown?" asked Shinji.

"他们不会淹死吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No...theres some compound in the LCL fluid which enables oxygen to pass through a humans body almost as though they were breathing. You can drink the stuff as well of course."

不...LCL 液体中含有某种化合物，能让氧气几乎像呼吸一样透过人体。当然，你也可以饮用它。

As Asuka finished talking, Shinji's head was filled with more questions still then answers. She was different, that much was certain. But everything almost seemed...to perfect.

当明日香说完话，真嗣的脑海中疑问依旧比答案多。她确实不同了，这一点毋庸置疑。但一切似乎都...太过完美了。

"You mentioned Second Impact earlier," said Shinji. "Are we experiencing something like that right now?"

“你之前提到了第二次冲击，”真嗣说道，“我们现在是不是正在经历类似的事情？”

Asuka was rather surprised at this question, thinking that Shinji wasn't quite as dumb as he looked.

明日香对这个问题的提出颇感惊讶，心想真嗣并不像他看起来那么笨。

"Third Impact," said Asuka softly. "This is likely what has happened."

"第三次冲击," 明日香轻声说道。"这很可能就是已经发生的事情。"

"Third Impact?" asked Shinji feeling confused.

"第三次冲击？" 真嗣感到困惑地问。"

"Its just something that could theoretically happen, though now that I see it for myself, it is rather shocking."

"这只是一个理论上可能发生的事情，不过现在亲眼目睹，确实相当震撼。"

"What is it though?" "那是什么东西？"

"I don't know," Asuka lied.

"我不知道，" 明日香撒谎道。

She knew what Third Impact was of course, but she wasn't about to tell Shinji the details. If Third Impact had actually happened though, why was she still alive? She could only summarize that something else must have happened instead.

她当然知道第三次冲击是什么，但她不打算告诉真治细节。如果第三次冲击真的发生了，那她为什么还活着？她只能总结说，一定发生了其他事情。

"So, we are probably the only people in the city?" asked Shinji.

"这么说，我们可能是城里仅有的人了？" 真嗣问道。

"Probably," shrugged Asuka. "I'd imagine there isn't anybody for several hundred miles though."

"大概吧，" 明日香耸了耸肩。"我想方圆几百英里内都不会有人了。

'As I thought.' sighed Shinji inside his mind.

“正如我所料。” 真嗣在心中叹息道。

They both lapsed into silence, both staring out at the ocean waves as they crashed unto the shore of Tokyo-3. Shinji was still thinking things over after what Asuka had told him. Second Impact was something only the history books told about, and that was very briefly glossed over, which now seemed to be purposefully done. Third Impact was an entirely other thing though. What could have caused it though? Another experiment? Was it something to do with nuclear warfare? Asuka was part of some company that seemed to research the human brain, so that might be part of it. Shinji however was pulled away from his train of thought as Asuka spoke.

两人都陷入了沉默，目光凝视着东京-3 海岸边汹涌的海浪。真嗣在听了明日香的话后，仍在反复思考。第二次冲击只在历史书中有所提及，而且只是简略带过，现在看来似乎是有意为之。第三次冲击则是另一回事。究竟是什么引起的呢？是另一次实验吗？还是与核战争有关？明日香所属的公司似乎在研究人脑，这可能是其中的一部分。然而，当明日香开口时，真嗣的思绪被打断了。

"Well, I told you about myself, now its your turn."

“好吧，我告诉了你我的事，现在轮到你了。”

"Huh?" said Shinji, not quite hearing her the first time.

"啊？" 真嗣第一次没太听清她的话。

"Tell my about yourself idiot!"

"给我讲讲你自己，白痴！"

'You could have phrased that differently,' thought Shinji.

'你本可以换个说法的，' 真嗣心想。

"Well, not much to say about myself. I've only been here in Tokyo-3 for a few weeks since this whole thing happened, and-"

"嗯，关于我自己也没什么好说的。自从这一切发生后，我只在这里的东京-3 待了几周，而且——"

"I'm already bored," sighed Asuka as she turned away from Shinji and made to lay down.

"我已经无聊了，"明日香叹了口气，转身离开真嗣，准备躺下。

Shinji was left with his mouth open for several minutes looking at Asuka's back before he closed it slowly.

真嗣张着嘴愣了几分钟，盯着明日香的背影，然后慢慢地合上了嘴。

'She purposefully did that,' thought Shinji as he took a sip of water. Well, even if he didn't say anything about himself, he did at least learn a few things about Asuka.

'她故意那么做的，' 真嗣想着，喝了一口水。好吧，即使他没有提及自己，至少他对明日香有了一些了解。

It was later in the day, and Shinji was returning from the city where he had been searching for more supplies. The market he had been visiting was slowly being deprived of its food, and Shinji was just starting to look for other places to scavenge. Surprisingly, during his search he found a car that seemed to be laden with supplies. The people who had once occupied the car seemed to be going on a camping trip. Whatever there intentions were, Shinji was just glad that they had packed enough canned food in the car to last several days. Among the food, he found a camping backpack, a pot and saucepan, and two packages of plastic forks. The only thing he wished he would have found was another sleeping bag, as sleeping on the beach was starting to take its toll on his back.

那天晚些时候，真嗣从城市回来，他在那里寻找更多的补给。他常去的那个市场食物逐渐匮乏，真嗣开始寻找其他地方搜刮。出乎意料的是，他在搜索中发现了一辆似乎装满物资的汽车。那些曾经占据汽车的人似乎要去露营。无论他们的意图是什么，真嗣很高兴他们准备了足够多的罐头食品，足够维持好几天。在食物中，他找到了一个露营背包、一个锅和煎锅，以及两包塑料叉子。他唯一希望找到的是另一个睡袋，因为睡在海滩上开始对他的背部造成影响。

Sliding down the slope, Shinji jogged the rest of the way towards the fire, the backpack shaking with each step. Whether this woke Asuka up, or if she was just resting, she heard it either way, and tilted her head upwards to look at Shinji.

滑下斜坡，真嗣一路小跑向火堆，背包随着每一步晃动。不知是这动静吵醒了明日香，还是她只是在休息，总之她听见了声响，便抬起头来看向真嗣。

"What the hell is that?" she asked the moment he placed the backpack beside the fire.

"那是什么鬼东西？" 他刚把背包放在火堆旁，她就问道。

"A camping backpack," replied Shinji as he wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his shirt.

"露营背包，" 真嗣回答着，用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头。

"How does that help?" retorted Asuka.

"那有什么用？" 明日香反驳道。

'Shut up for a minute and I'll tell you,' thought Shinji as he started unloading stuff.

“安静一会儿，我这就告诉你，”真嗣边想边开始卸货。

Asuka watched him silently as he removed the plastic forks, the pot and pan, and then the canned food. Upon seeing these last items, Asuka let out a derisive snort and said-

明日香默默地看着他，他先是拿出了塑料叉子、锅和煎锅，然后是罐头食品。看到这些罐头，明日香发出了一声嘲讽的哼声，说道——

"Canned food?" “罐头食品？”

"Would you rather continue to eat candy bars and bags of chips?"

"你宁愿继续吃糖果和薯片吗？"

Asuka ignored him and said, "You can't eat this by just opening it. Whats more, do you even have a means of opening this?"

明日香无视他，说道：“你不能光打开它就吃。再说了，你有打开它的工具吗？”

Shinji dug around inside the backpack and retrieved a can opener in reply to Asuka.

真嗣在背包里翻找了一番，拿出一个开罐器回应明日香。

"Anything else you want to complain about?"

“还有什么想抱怨的吗？”

'Yeah, why am I stuck here with you,' thought Asuka.

“是啊，为什么我非得和你困在这里，”明日香心想。

She turned her head away from Shinji then, and curled back under the sleeping bag.

她随即转过头去不再看真嗣，蜷缩回睡袋里。

Shinji meanwhile starting going over the canned food he had found and organizing it. Each of them was well within the expiration date range, so he wasn't worried about that. He was going to make this last as long as possible though. The food itself was unusual for camping trips, since none of the normal was there, like ramen for instance, but Shinji thought that he could work with what he had.

与此同时，真嗣开始整理他找到的罐头食品。每个罐头的保质期都在合理范围内，所以他并不担心这一点。他打算尽可能延长这些食物的使用时间。这些食物对于露营旅行来说有些不寻常，因为没有常见的那些，比如拉面，但真嗣认为他可以利用现有的资源。

Grabbing the pot, he walked over to the ocean of Tokyo-3 and filled it half full with the strange LCL fluid.

他拿起锅，走到东京-3 的海洋边，用那奇怪的 LCL 液体装满了半锅。

'Well, I can drink it,' thought Shinji, 'and even there is anything harmful in there, boiling it should get rid of it.'

“好吧，我可以喝它，”真嗣想，“即使里面有什么有害物质，煮沸应该能去除它们。”

Taking the pot back to the fire, he quickly ran into a problem. He didn't have a way to suspend the pot over the fire evenly. He himself could have dealt with the the food being on the slightly more crispy side, but he had a feeling Asuka wouldn't stand for it.

他将锅子拿回火堆旁，很快遇到了一个问题。他没有方法将锅均匀地悬挂在火上。他自己倒是可以忍受食物稍微焦脆一些，但他觉得明日香肯定不会接受。

Deciding on his course, he grabbed several of the smaller pieces of fire wood, and dug them down into the sand on either side of the fire. Wishing more than anything that he had a knife right now. He quickly looked around the beach within the fires radius for a particularly pointed rock. After finding one, he returned to the fire and started gouging out the wood in the center of the sticks.

决定好方案后，他抓起几根较小的柴火，将它们插进火堆两侧的沙子里。此刻他无比希望手边有一把刀。他迅速环顾火光范围内的海滩，寻找一块特别尖锐的石头。找到后，他回到火堆旁，开始用石头在木棍中心挖出凹槽。

During this, Asuka turned around briefly and watched for a few seconds as Shinji struggled at making do with the jagged rock. Laughing internally at him for a moment, she turned back around and slept calmly.

在此期间，明日香短暂地转过身来，观察了真嗣用锯齿状石头勉强操作的几秒钟。她内心暗笑了一会儿，然后转回身去，平静地入睡了。

Shinji didn't gave an indication that he noticed this, as he was too absorbed in his work. After almost forty-five minutes of this, Shinji had both the stick to where he roughly wanted them. Finding a rather long piece of wood, he tested its strength by pick of the pot by the handle with it before determining it worthy. Placing the stick atop the other two, the ends fell into the groves he had hollowed out by the rock. At first, he held onto both ends of the stick, afraid that it might suddenly snap, but it seemed to be able to hold the pot above the flames. Thankfully, the fire had died down since he had last stacked wood on it, so there wasn't any danger in the stick breaking from the fire.

真嗣并未表现出他注意到了这一点，因为他正全神贯注于工作。经过近四十五分钟的努力，真嗣终于将木棍调整到了大致理想的位置。他找到一根较长的木头，通过用它挑起锅柄来测试其强度，确认其足够结实后，便将这根木棍架在另外两根之上，木棍两端恰好嵌入他用岩石凿出的凹槽中。起初，他紧握木棍两端，担心它会突然断裂，但似乎它能稳稳地托起锅，悬于火焰之上。幸运的是，自上次添柴后火势已减弱，因此木棍因火而折断的风险也大大降低。

With the water starting to boil, Shinji now looked towards the canned food. He wasn't a fan of canned rice, but it was either that or starve he supposed. Dumping the entire contents of the rice into the pot, he then grabbed the can of chicken broth beside him and opened it, slowly pouring some of it into the pot. He was more careful with this, as there was only one can, whereas he had several of the rice.

随着水开始沸腾，真嗣将目光转向罐装食品。他并不喜欢罐装米饭，但想来除了吃这个，就只能饿肚子了。他将整罐米饭倒入锅中，随后拿起手边的鸡汤罐头，打开后缓缓倒入一些进锅。他对此更为小心，因为鸡汤只有一罐，而米饭他还有好几罐。

Placing the lid over the pot, he let it cook for fifteen minutes, before opening the lid and tasting it.

盖上锅盖，他让菜炖了十五分钟，然后打开盖子尝了尝。

'Some salt and garlic wouldn't hurt,' thought Shinji, wishing that he had access to such ingredients.

'加点盐和蒜应该不错，' 真嗣心想，希望自己能拿到这些调料。

Looking at the rest of the canned food, he was tempted to cook some corn to go with the rice, but not being able to cook it in the sauce pan was a problem. Well, maybe next time he could just toss everything together. If Asuka was going to be picky about even that, then she could cook her own food.

看着剩下的罐头食品，他很想煮些玉米配米饭，但无法在平底锅里烹饪是个问题。嗯，也许下次他可以把所有东西都混在一起。如果明日香连这也挑剔，那她可以自己做饭。

'Like that would happen,' thought Shinji.

'像那样的事才不会发生呢，' 真嗣心想。

Taking the pot off the fire, he let it cool for a few minutes before he decide it was time to wake Asuka up. Though it seemed there relationship had improved, he still wasn't keen on taking chances in case she was awake. Walking in a wide arc along where she lay, he came around to the other side where her face was turned.

他将锅从火上取下，让它冷却了几分钟，然后决定是时候叫醒明日香了。虽然他们的关系似乎有所改善，但他仍然不愿冒险，以防她已经醒了。他沿着她躺着的地方绕了一个大圈，来到她的脸转向的另一侧。

"Huh...she is asleep," mumbled Shinji aloud.

“呃...她还在睡，”真嗣自言自语道。

Asuka was curled up under the sleep, her face just poking through. Most of her complexion had returned so she wasn't pasty white like when Shinji had found her near death. Shinji hadn't asked her about that, nor did he think he'd ever ask her, and he didn't think she'd tell him anyway. Her lips were pink from the cold as were her cheeks.

明日香蜷缩在被子下，脸庞微微露出。她的肤色大部分已经恢复，不再是真嗣发现她濒死时的苍白。真嗣没有问她那件事，也不认为他会问，而且他觉得她也不会告诉他。她的嘴唇和脸颊因寒冷而泛着粉红色。

'She must not be able to deal with the cold as well as me,' thought Shinji briefly as he watched her sleep. Though next second, he berated himself, knowing that if she caught him watching her like this, it'd be the death of him.

“她肯定不如我耐寒，”真嗣短暂地想道，同时注视着她的睡颜。但下一秒，他就责备自己，知道如果她发现自己这样盯着她，那他可就死定了。

Crouching down next to her, he placed his hand against her shoulder, and nudged her gently. At first, she didn't budge, but after several more times of nudging her, Asuka started to stir. Her eyes first opened slowly, and the first thing they saw were Shinji. Shinji saw this as well and was about to take a step back when Asuka closed her eyes again.

他蹲在她旁边，把手放在她的肩膀上，轻轻地推了推她。起初，她没有反应，但在几次轻推之后，明日香开始动了。她的眼睛先是慢慢睁开，第一眼看到的就是真嗣。真嗣也看到了这一幕，正要后退一步时，明日香又闭上了眼睛。

'What was that?' wondered Shinji.

'那是什么？' 真嗣疑惑道。

He paused in place for several seconds, before he took a step towards her.

他在原地停顿了几秒钟，然后向她迈出了一步。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"What," she groaned back. "If you didn't wake me up for a good reason, I'm gonna kill you..."

"什么，"她呻吟着回应。"如果你不是为了个好理由叫醒我，我就要杀了你……"

'By what? Crawling after me?' thought Shinji.

'用什么？爬着追我吗？' 真嗣心想。

"I made food," he said simply.

"我做了饭，"他简单地说道。

At this, she opened her eyes again, and though Shinji didn't want to admit it, she was rather cute as she did this.

听到这话，她又睁开了眼睛，虽然真嗣不想承认，但她这样做确实相当可爱。

"What did you make?" “你做了什么？”

"Some rice with chicken broth?"

“一些鸡汤泡饭？”

"Thats it?" “就这？”

"Were you expecting a five course meal?"

“你还期待着五道菜的大餐吗？”

Asuka shut up after that, and slowly sat up, letting the sleeping bag fall from her body. She yawned with a hand covering her mouth, and stretched her arms up in the air. She must have been been feeling better, as she even tried standing up, which brought a grin to Shinji's face. But the grin dropped as Asuka shot him a death glare.

自那之后，明日香安静了下来，缓缓坐起身，让睡袋从身上滑落。她用手遮住嘴巴打了个哈欠，然后伸直双臂向上伸展。她一定感觉好多了，甚至尝试站起来，这让真嗣的脸上露出了微笑。但当明日香向他投来死亡凝视时，笑容瞬间消失了。

"So, where is it?" “那么，它在哪儿？”

"Right here," said Shinji as he held the pot out for her.

“就在这儿，”真嗣说着，将锅递给她。

She looked at it for several seconds before she asked, "You didn't do anything to this did you?"

她盯着它看了好几秒，然后问道：“你没对这东西做什么吧？”

"Just eat it..." sighed Shinji, clearly getting annoyed with her constant complaining.

“就吃吧……”真嗣叹了口气，显然对她没完没了的抱怨感到不耐烦。

Asuka looked at him one final time before she raised the pot and fork to her lips and took a small bite of the rice. She chewed slowly, surprised at the flavor and tenderness of the rice.

明日香最后看了他一眼，然后举起锅和叉子送到嘴边，小心翼翼地吃了一小口米饭。她慢慢地咀嚼着，对米饭的味道和柔软感到惊讶。

"Well?" asked Shinji. “嗯？” 真嗣问道。

Asuka's head turned towards him, her hair wiping around in a mad flurry, and Shinji thought that she was about to complain until she said-

明日香的头转向他，发丝在狂乱中飞舞，真嗣以为她又要抱怨，直到她开口说道——

"Its not bad actually." She said this as though she had assumed it would have been inedible.

“其实还不错。” 她说这话时，仿佛她原本以为这会难以下咽。

"You like it?" “你喜欢吗？”

"I wouldn't say I like it or dislike. It certainly needs a few things, and white rice with chicken broth isn't something I'd ever considered mixing before...but I guess it works."

“我不敢说喜欢或不喜欢。它确实需要一些改进，而且白米饭配鸡汤这种搭配，我以前从未想过……但我想它还算行。”

Shinji was rather surprised at her tone as she said this, it was almost as though she was evaluating it as someone who knows how to cook would.

真嗣对她说话的语气感到相当惊讶，那语气几乎就像是一个懂得烹饪的人在评价一样。

"You act as though you cook yourself."

“你表现得好像你自己也会做饭似的。”

"Oh, I do, though I haven't in a while. While I was in college, I mostly cooked for myself instead of eating the cafeteria food."

“哦，我确实会，虽然有一阵子没做了。上大学的时候，我大多是自己做饭，而不是吃食堂的饭菜。”

Asuka turned towards Shinji and saw that he was smiling slightly. Guessing what he was smiling about however, he quickly said-

明日香转向真嗣，发现他正微微一笑。猜到他在笑什么，她迅速说道——

"Well, I haven't cooked in a while though, so don't expect it to happen."

“好吧，我有一阵子没做饭了，所以别指望能有多好。”

'I should have guessed,' thought Shinji as the smile slid from his face, but Asuka seemed to be in a better mood now.

“我早该猜到的，”真嗣心想，笑容从脸上消失，但明日香现在似乎心情好多了。

After finishing her portion she passed the pot to Shinji, though she kept her fork. Shinji didn't need Asuka's explanation of what that meant.

吃完自己的份后，她把锅递给了真嗣，但叉子仍握在手中。真嗣不需要明日香解释这意味着什么。

After finishing his own portion, Shinji went to the sea and washed the pot clean, preparing it for tomorrows meal. Walking back, he placed the clean pot beside the rest of the canned goods and sat on his side of the fire.

吃完自己的份后，真嗣走到海边把锅洗干净，为明天的餐食做准备。走回来时，他把干净的锅放在罐头食品旁边，坐在火堆的另一侧。

'That could have been worse I suppose,' thought Shinji as he leaned backwards, looking up at the sky which had started turning crimson as the sun set.

“我想这还不算太糟。”真嗣向后靠去，仰望着天空，太阳落山时天空已染上了深红色。

Across the fire from him, Asuka had her face resting in her hands as she gazed into the fire. Eventually her gaze was brought upwards as she looked at Shinji leaning backwards and looking up at the sky. She frowned for several seconds, until Shinji's eyes darted away from the sky and turned back towards the fire. Though Asuka tried averting her eyes from him, Shinji still caught her.

在火堆的对面，明日香将脸埋在双手中，凝视着火焰。最终，她的目光上移，看向了向后仰头望天的真嗣。她皱眉了几秒钟，直到真嗣的视线从天空移开，转回火堆。尽管明日香试图避开他的目光，真嗣还是捕捉到了她的视线。

"What?" he asked rather simply, not bothering to allude to the fact that he had caught her watching him.

“怎么了？”他相当简单地问道，并没有暗示他注意到她在看他。

Asuka took several seconds to reply though, not wanting to look him directly in the eye. She wasn't embarrassed, rather, she was just angry at herself for looking at him in the first place.

明日香花了好几秒才回答，不想直接看他的眼睛。她并不感到尴尬，相反，她只是对自己一开始就看着他感到生气。

"What brought you to Tokyo-3?"

"是什么让你来到第三新东京市的？"

"What brought me to Tokyo-3?" repeated Shinji.

"是什么让我来到第三新东京市的？" 真嗣重复道。

"Just answer the question," sighed Asuka as she turned her head back towards him.

"直接回答问题，" 明日香叹了口气，将头转回面向他。

"Well," started Shinji, "my father did I suppose..."

“嗯，”真嗣开口道，“我想我父亲确实……”

"You're father?" replied Asuka rather surprised.

“你父亲？”明日香有些惊讶地反问道。

Shinji hesitated here, not keen on the subject. Asuka however noticed this sudden reluctance to the question and assumed that it had to do with his father.

真嗣在这里犹豫了，对这个话题并不热衷。然而，明日香注意到了他突然的迟疑，并猜测这与他父亲有关。

'Hmmm...so he doesn't like his father much?' thought Asuka.

'嗯...这么说，他不太喜欢他父亲？' 明日香心想。

"What does your father have to do with you being here?"

“你父亲和你在这里有什么关系？”

Shinji didn't answer for several minutes, and Asuka was almost ready to give up when he finally replied.

真嗣沉默了几分钟，就在明日香几乎要放弃时，他终于回答了。

"I'm not sure what he wanted from me by being here. But he's shuffled me around from place to place ever since my mother died."

"我不确定他在这里想从我这里得到什么。但从我母亲去世后，他就一直把我从这个地方挪到那个地方。"

"You're mother is dead?" asked Asuka, perking up slightly.

"你母亲去世了？" 明日香微微抬起头问道。

"Yeah, she died when I was young, so I don't really remember her. Her name was Yui. Anyways, my father moved me around every few months so I never stayed in one place very long. School was never fun since I never got to know anybody very closely, and eventually I just started not caring since I'd be leaving eventually."

“是的，她在我很小的时候就去世了，所以我其实不太记得她了。她的名字叫优。总之，我父亲每隔几个月就带我搬家，所以我从没在一个地方待很久。上学从来都不好玩，因为我从没机会和任何人深入了解，久而久之，我也就不再在意了，反正迟早要离开。”

Shinji was rather surprised how easily he was able to talk about these things with Asuka, seeing as how he had never mentioned this to anybody before.

真嗣颇为惊讶，自己居然能如此轻易地和明日香谈论这些事情，毕竟他以前从未向任何人提起过。

"About three weeks ago, my father had me move here, to Tokyo-3 and I roomed with a guy who was looking for a roommate."

“大约三周前，我父亲让我搬到这里，东京-3，和一个正在找室友的家伙合租。”

"How long ago was that?" asked Asuka.

“那是多久以前的事了？”明日香问道。

"Two and a half weeks maybe since I moved in."

"大概两周半吧，自从我搬进来之后。"

"Is that taking into account the days since this all happened," said Asuka as she waved her hand towards the sea of Tokyo-3.

"你是指从这一切发生以来的天数吗？" 明日香说着，挥手向着东京-3 的海洋。

"I didn't even think of that," replied Shinji.

"我都没考虑到这个，" 真嗣回答道。

How many days had it been since he had even woken up on this beach? He wasn't even sure anymore.

自从他上次在这片海滩上醒来已经过去多少天了？他甚至都不太确定了。

"A week, maybe more," said Shinji.

“大概一周，或许更久，”真嗣说道。

Asuka thought about this for a moment. A week sounded about right.

明日香想了一会儿。一周听起来差不多。

"So three, maybe four weeks," she murmured as she bit her lip.

“大概三到四周吧，”她轻声说道，咬了咬嘴唇。

Shinji looked at her for several seconds before he asked, "How long have you been here Asuka?"

真嗣盯着她看了几秒钟，然后问道：“你在这里多久了，明日香？”

"Before this? A week I'd say," she said as she continued looking into the fire.

“在这之前？大概一周吧，”她一边说一边继续凝视着火光。

Asuka thought about the time difference. If Shinji had arrived here in Tokyo-3 four or three weeks ago, and she had arrived here two weeks ago, then whatever happened to cause this would surely have been taking affect during both there times here. But there was no alert of that, nothing to indicate anything had happened at the point. She could clearly remember visiting the facility and running the tests on Eva Unit 02. There was no indication that the Angels would have attacked this soon though. Whats more, where was she during all this? Why did it still feel like a large chunk of her memory was gone?

明日香考虑着时差。如果真嗣四或三周前到达了第三新东京市，而她是两周前到达的，那么导致这一切发生的事件肯定在他们两人在此期间都有所影响。但没有任何警报，没有任何迹象表明发生了什么。她清楚地记得参观设施并对 EVA 二号机进行测试。尽管如此，没有迹象表明使徒会这么快发动攻击。更重要的是，这段时间她在哪里？为什么她仍然感觉自己的记忆缺失了一大块？

Asuka held her head in her hands as she thought this, but nothing about it made any sense.

明日香双手抱头思考着，但这一切毫无逻辑可言。

"My father was about to send me to somebody else's place the day before this all happened I remember though," continued Shinji, unaware of Asuka's lapse in the conversation. "Though I don't remember who that person was."

“我记得，就在这一切发生的前一天，我父亲原本打算把我送到别人家里，”真嗣继续说道，没有察觉到明日香在对话中的走神。“虽然我不记得那个人是谁了。”

'Would you shut up already,' thought Asuka as she held her hands over her face.

“你能不能闭嘴啊，”明日香心里想着，双手捂住了脸。

"After my mother died, my father seemed to become obsessed with his work though...I think thats why he sent me away, because he didn't have time for me. I don't know why he would have wanted me back though..."

"母亲去世后，父亲似乎对工作变得痴迷起来...我想这就是他送我离开的原因，因为他没有时间照顾我。但我不明白他为何又想让我回来..."

Shinji sat like that for a while, trying to remember what his father had told him the day he was supposed to leave for Tokyo-3. Wasn't it something to do with work? Why couldn't he remember? His father was so focused on what he did at the company that he owned, that he never had time to spend with his Shinji. He had never received birthday presents or cake. Every Christmas was the same; he always just got a card and the occasional phone call, but nothing significant.

碇真嗣就那样坐了一会儿，试图回忆起父亲在他动身前往第三新东京市那天告诉他的话。是不是和工作有关？为什么他记不起来？他的父亲全神贯注于自己公司的业务，以至于从未有时间陪伴真嗣。他从未收到过生日礼物或蛋糕。每个圣诞节都如出一辙；他总是只收到一张卡片和偶尔的电话问候，却没有任何实质性的关怀。

Shinji remembered again why he despised his father. For all the shuffling around he had to endure through the years, for never knowing what had happened to his mother. Sometimes he wondered if his mother hadn't died at the hands of his father...even if it was by accident.

真嗣再次想起了他为何憎恨自己的父亲。多年来他不得不忍受的种种变故，以及从未知晓母亲的下落。有时他甚至怀疑，母亲是否就是被父亲所害……即便那可能只是个意外。

Where was his father though if he was alive? Was he holed up in some bunker? That seemed the most likely place he would be if he was alive. Maybe other people had found similar shelter. Shinji had heard about bunkers being placed all over Tokyo-3, and even that the large skyscrapers were able to retract into the ground, and that some underground complex protected them-

如果父亲还活着，他又会在哪里呢？是不是躲在某个掩体里？如果他还活着，这似乎是最有可能的藏身之处。或许其他人也找到了类似的避难所。真嗣听说过东京-3 各地都设有掩体，甚至那些高耸的摩天大楼也能缩入地下，还有某些地下设施在保护着他们——

'Nerv,' thought Shinji suddenly. 'Thats right...thats where my father worked...is the director for that matter...or was I suppose.'

'NERV，' 真嗣突然想到。'对了...那就是父亲工作的地方...或者说，他是那里的指挥官...或者说，曾经是吧。'

Shinji stood up then, and stretched, looking up at the sky as he did so. It was slowly becoming darker now.

真嗣随即站起身来，伸了个懒腰，抬头望向天空。天色正逐渐暗下来。

Turning his gaze to Asuka, he saw that she was still looking into the fire. He was wondering what she was thinking about, since she had spoken a word for several minutes now.

他将目光转向明日香，只见她仍在凝视着火堆。他在想她此刻在想些什么，因为她已经好几分钟没说话了。

"Hey...Asu-" “嘿...明日香-”

"Shut Up! You're annoying." she replied abruptly.

"闭嘴！你真烦人。" 她突然回答道。

Shinji was rather taken aback, but replied cooly, "If you wanted to be left alone, you could have just said so."

真嗣有些吃惊，但冷静地回应道："如果你想要独处，直说就好了。"

"I want you to shut the fuck up is what I want you to do," snarled Asuka as her gaze darted up to him.

"我要你他妈的闭嘴，这就是我想让你做的，" 明日香咆哮着，目光猛地转向他。

"Fine," shrugged Shinji. He was too used to her behavior to give a damn about it anymore.

"好吧，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。他已经习惯了她的行为，不再对此感到在意。

Figuring that now would be a good time to take a walk, Shinji grabbed one of the water bottles beside the fire and decided to walk up the beach a ways. He hadn't been up very far, as the city was always the more promising when it came to supplies. But since they had enough for several days, he could take it easy for a bit.

真嗣觉得现在是散步的好时机，他拿起火堆旁的一瓶水，决定沿着海滩走一段。他之前并没有走得太远，因为城市总是更容易找到补给。但由于他们现在有足够几天的物资，他可以稍微放松一下。

"I'll be back later," said Shinji as he started walking away from the fire.

"我一会儿就回来，" 真嗣说着，开始远离火堆。

Asuka didn't even give him a second glance.

明日香连看都没看他第二眼。

Shinji was away long after the sun had already set. He wasn't sure how long he walked for, but then again, he had a lot on his mind. He had forgotten about his father until Asuka had brought it up, and though he wasn't pleased about remembering such times, he couldn't deny the fact that he was curious to know whether his father was alive or dead. Either way though, he couldn't do anything about it in his current state.

太阳早已落山，真嗣却仍未归来。他不确定自己走了多久，但话说回来，他脑子里装了太多事情。直到明日香提起，他才想起自己的父亲，尽管回忆起那些时光并不愉快，但他无法否认自己对父亲是生是死感到好奇。不过无论如何，以他目前的状态，对此也无能为力。

Finally getting back to the fire, he saw that it had steadily died down so only embers remained. In front of it, Asuka was still sitting with her head resting in her hands. Shinji couldn't help but laugh slightly since she hadn't moved an inch since he had left, but as he got closer, he noticed that she had fallen asleep. Pausing for a second, he eventually grabbed the sleeping bag beside her, and made to place it around her shoulders. Almost immediately, upon touching her shoulder with the edge of the blanket, Asuka's eyes opened, and her defenses kicked in. She immediately grabbed Shinji's wrist with her left hand and twisted it before pushing her full weight against his chest with her shoulder so that he tumbled backwards. She seemed to have become used to not moving her legs, because she spun around like a top and placed her right hand on his neck, poised to break it.

终于回到篝火旁，他发现火已渐渐熄灭，只剩下一堆余烬。火堆前，明日香依旧坐在那里，头埋在双手中。真嗣忍不住轻笑，因为她自他离开后便一动未动，但当他走近时，注意到她已经睡着了。他停顿了一下，最终拿起她身旁的睡袋，准备披在她肩上。就在他用毯子边缘触碰到她肩膀的瞬间，明日香的眼睛猛地睁开，防御本能立刻启动。她迅速用左手抓住真嗣的手腕，扭动后以全身重量猛推他的胸口，使他向后跌倒。她似乎已经习惯了不动腿，像陀螺一样旋转，右手随即按在他的脖子上，准备施力折断。

For one wild instance, Shinji thought that she had returned to the girl who he had first met on the beach who was ready to kill him, but Shinji saw the flicker in her eyes as she realized that it was him. Slowly, Asuka released her grip on his throat and then released her hand from his wrist. She seemed to be slowly gathering what was happening, though the anger still didn't leave her eyes.

有那么一瞬间，真嗣以为她变回了当初在海滩上初次相遇时那个准备置他于死地的女孩，但当她意识到是他时，眼中闪过了一丝动摇。渐渐地，明日香松开了掐住他喉咙的手，随后也从他的手腕上放开了。她似乎在慢慢理清眼前的情况，尽管眼中的怒火并未消散。

Pushing himself upright, Shinji looked back at her for a second before he sighed and said, "Do you really think someone other than myself is here?"

挣扎着坐起身，真嗣回头看了她一眼，随即叹了口气，说道：“你真的认为除了我之外还有别人在这里吗？”

Shinji didn't know the meaning of his words, but they certainly affected Asuka, who was reminded of ghosts from her past.

真嗣并不明白自己话语的含义，但它们无疑触动了明日香，让她想起了过去的幽灵。

She spun around and ignored him, anger flaring up within her.

她转过身去，无视他，怒火在心中升腾。

Shinji watched her for a moment longer before he stood up and walked around to his side of the fire while mumbling quietly, "Sorry would have been nice."

真嗣又看了她一会儿，然后站起来，绕到火堆的另一边，小声嘀咕着："要是道歉就好了。"

"I'm not sorry for anything," said Asuka without lowering her voice.

"我没什么好道歉的，"明日香没有降低声音说道。

'At least you're still talking,' thought Shinji as he sat down.

"'至少你还在说话，' 真嗣坐下时心想。

Piling more wood on the fire, he built it higher until it had returned to its former blazing glory. Turning towards Asuka he asked, "So? Why were you so focused earlier that you fell asleep sitting up?"

他又往火堆里添了些木柴，将其堆高直至恢复了先前的熊熊烈焰。转身面向明日香，他问道：“那么？你之前为何如此专注，以至于坐着就睡着了？”

Shinji wasn't sure, but he thought he saw Asuka's cheeks redden slightly at his words, though it may have just been from the heat of the fire.

真嗣不确定，但他觉得明日香的脸颊在他话音刚落时微微泛红，尽管那可能只是火光的炙烤所致。

Asuka debated whether to tell him or not, but didn't see any reason why she shouldn't.

明日香犹豫着是否要告诉他，但没觉得有什么理由不该说。

"I was thinking about the time between when you arrived here in Tokyo-3 and when I arrived. It doesn't make sense. Whatever caused...this...Third Impact, must have been happening while we were in the city. I was never told of anything though, and even if it was predicted to happen, there would have been means for us to stop it."

我在想你抵达第三新东京市和我到达之间的时间。这说不通。无论引发……这……第三次冲击的原因是什么，肯定是在我们在城里的时候发生的。但我从未被告知任何事情，即使它被预见到会发生，也应该有办法阻止它。

"You act like Tokyo-3 was the epicenter of it all."

“你表现得好像东京-3 是这一切的中心。”

"I'm sure that most of the cities on earth like a lot like this as well, but I'm positive that Tokyo-3 was the epicenter."

“我敢肯定地球上大多数城市都和这里很像，但我确信东京-3 是中心。”

"What makes you say that?"

“你为什么这么说？”

"I have my reasons," said Asuka with an air of superiority. In truth, she couldn't be positive that Tokyo-3 was where it had happened, but judging how importantly a role the city played in the defense against the Angels, there couldn't be any other possibility.

"我有我的理由，" 明日香带着一种优越感说道。实际上，她并不能完全确定第三新东京市就是事情发生的地方，但考虑到这座城市在对抗使徒中的重要角色，不可能有其他可能性。

"So...you're saying there must have been some indication to Third Impact in the days leading up to it?"

"那么...你是说在第三次冲击发生前的日子里，一定有一些迹象预示着它？"

"Yeah, but judging by what you told me, and what I already know, nothing seemed different."

"是的，但根据你告诉我的，以及我已经知道的，一切似乎都没有什么不同。"

'She has a point,' thought Shinji. 'But nothing was out of the ordinary that I can remember. Nothing that struck me as odd.'

'她说的有道理，' 真嗣心想。'但我记得没有什么不寻常的事。没有什么让我觉得奇怪的。'

'That may not be necessarily true though,' said a voice deep inside him.

'不过那也不一定就是真的，' 他内心深处的一个声音说道。

And that made Shinji remember why he himself was in Tokyo-3.

这让他想起了自己为什么会在东京-3。

"Asuka, can I ask you something?"

"明日香，我能问你个问题吗？"

"What!?" she snapped back at him, clearly thinking again.

"什么！？" 她厉声回道，显然又在思考。"

"Have you ever heard about a company here in Tokyo-3 called Nerv?"

"你有没有听说过东京-3 这里有个叫 NERV 的公司？"

Asuka heard the word, or thought she did, but at first thought that Shinji had mumbled something else.

明日香听到了那个词，或者她以为自己听到了，但起初以为真嗣咕哝了别的什么。

"What did you say?" “你说什么？”

"Nerv. A company called Nerv here in Tokyo-3."

“NERV。一个叫 NERV 的公司，在东京-3 这里。”

"How do you know about that?"

"你怎么知道那件事的？"

Shinji wasn't so much surprised by the question as he was surprised at Asuka's tone. Her voice had gone stoney and a dark shadow had passed under her eyes.

真嗣对这个问题并不感到惊讶，他惊讶的是明日香说话的语气。她的声音变得冷硬，眼底也掠过了一抹阴影。

"How do you know about Nerv?" she asked again.

“你怎么知道 NERV 的事？”她再次问道。

"My father asked me to come here. He works at the company."

"我父亲让我来这里的。他在公司工作。"

Asuka frowned heavily at Shinji, but the shadow seemed to have gone from her eyes.

明日香对真嗣皱起了眉头，但她的眼中似乎已经没有了阴影。

"Is there a problem?" asked Shinji hesitantly.

"有什么问题吗？" 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Asuka just stared at Shinji for a long while until she asked, "What is your fathers name?"

明日香只是长时间地盯着真嗣，然后问道：“你父亲的名字是什么？”

"His name? Its Gendo, Gendo Ikari."

“他的名字？是源堂，碇源堂。”

Shinji didn't have trouble at all spotting the obviously surprised look that appeared on Asuka's face. Her eyes widened slightly and even her lips parted to form a small gasp.

真嗣毫不费力地捕捉到了明日香脸上明显惊讶的表情。她的眼睛微微睁大，嘴唇微张，发出了一声轻微的惊呼。

"Er...Asuka...do you know-"

“呃...明日香...你知道——”

But he was cut off as Asuka darted around the fire surprisingly fast, even with her legs as unstable as they were, and sat directly in front of Shinji, grabbing at his shoulders fiercely.

但他的话被突然打断，明日香以惊人的速度绕过火堆，尽管她的双腿如此不稳，她还是直接坐在了真嗣面前，猛地抓住他的肩膀。

"You're the son of Gendo Ikari?" she nearly shouted.

“你是碇源堂的儿子？”她几乎喊了出来。

"Is there something wrong with that?" asked Shinji, only too aware of how close their faces were, and that he could feel Asuka's breath on him.

“这有什么问题吗？”真嗣问道，他非常清楚两人的脸靠得有多近，甚至能感受到明日香呼出的气息。

Asuka relented slightly there, maybe realizing as well how close they were, because she let go of his shoulders and leaned back slightly.

明日香稍微放松了一些，或许她也意识到了两人靠得太近，因为她松开了他的肩膀，稍微向后仰了仰。

"Theres nothing wrong with it," she said, "I was just surprised is all. Your father is the director after all."

"这没什么不对的，" 她说，"我只是有点惊讶罢了。毕竟你父亲是总监。"

"Is it that big a deal?"

"有那么严重吗？"

"You don't even know what Nerv does, do you?"

"你甚至不知道 Nerv 是做什么的，对吧？"

"Not a clue." “毫无头绪。”

Asuka sighed, clearly not in the mood for a full run-through of the purpose of Nerv.

明日香叹了口气，显然没心情详细解释 NERV 的宗旨。

"I'm not saying anything right now, because it would take too long to tell you...but I should I suppose correct what I said earlier and now say that I work for Nerv...or did I guess."

“我现在什么也不想说，因为解释起来太费时间了……不过，我想我应该纠正之前的话，现在说我是为 NERV 工作的……或者我猜是这样。”

"So...everything was a lie from before?"

“所以……一切从一开始就是谎言吗？”

"The thing about my thesis paper? That was all fake. Gehirn though was the predecessor to Nerv, and though I was too young at the time, I heard about it from other people. You're father and some other staff members were in charge at Gehirn, and when that became Nerv, your father took over. My own mother worked at Gehirn for a time."

"关于我的论文？那全是假的。Gehirn 虽然是 Nerv 的前身，尽管我当时还小，但听别人提起过。你的父亲和其他一些工作人员当时负责 Gehirn，后来变成 Nerv 时，你父亲接管了。我母亲也在 Gehirn 工作过一段时间。"

As Asuka said this last part, her voice got quieter, though Shinji didn't really notice this.

当明日香说到最后这部分时，她的声音变小了，尽管真嗣并没有注意到这一点。

"So did Nerv have anything to do with Third Impact."

"那么 Nerv 和第三次冲击有关系吗？"

Asuka hesitated for a second. Shinji already knew about Nerv, and since he was the son of the director, there didn't seem to be any point in not telling him. Not to mention the director had seemed to want him in the city for some reason.

明日香犹豫了一瞬。真嗣已经知道 NERV 的事了，而且既然他是指挥官的儿子，似乎没有理由不告诉他。更不用说指挥官似乎出于某种原因希望他来到这座城市。

'Its possible that he was even supposed to be the Third Child,' thought Asuka suddenly. She had heard that the Third was scheduled to arrive just before she did, but if he was supposed to be the Third Child...

'他甚至可能是预定成为第三适格者的人选，'明日香突然想到。她听说第三适格者计划在她之前到达，但如果他本应是第三适格者的话...

Asuka glanced at Shinji for a brief instance before she shook her head and thought, 'No way someone this weak could pilot an Eva.'

明日香瞥了真嗣一眼，随即摇了摇头，心想：“这种弱不禁风的人怎么可能驾驶 Eva。”

"Partially yes, partially no," replied Asuka to Shinji's earlier question. "They weren't the ones that instrumented it, but they hold some fault I suppose."

"部分是，部分不是，" 明日香对真嗣之前的问题回答道。"他们不是策划者，但他们也有一定的责任，我想。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Entirely honest...I'm not sure. I just know what I've been told."

"完全坦白...我不确定。我只知道我所被告知的。"

Shinji waited for more, but Asuka seemed to be done.

真嗣等待着更多的话语，但明日香似乎已经说完了。

"Thats enough for one night though," said Asuka as she started moving back towards her side. Shinji watched her slide herself across the sand for several seconds before he stood up, and wondering what he was doing, walked over to her and held his hand out for her. She looked at it for several seconds, puzzled over what he was implying.

“今晚就到此为止吧，”明日香说着，开始向她那边移动。真嗣注视着她在沙滩上滑行了几秒钟，然后站起身来，心中疑惑着自己该做什么，走向她并伸出手。她盯着他的手看了几秒钟，困惑于他的意图。

"You're legs aren't going to get better if you don't put some pressure on them," said Shinji rather awkwardly.

“如果你不施加点压力，你的腿是不会好转的，”真嗣有些尴尬地说道。

"And I'm supposed to trust your judgement?" asked Asuka, though he did have a point she supposed.

“我凭什么相信你的判断？”明日香问道，不过她觉得他说的也有道理。

So, rather against her wishes, Asuka held out her hand and grasped Shinji's own. He pulled her upward gently, steading her body as he brought it upward, carefully watching her face. She did wince a few times as her legs straightened themselves, and Shinji thought several times that she might collapse from not having used her legs for so long, but she seemed to be tougher than he thought. She even reluctantly placed her left arm upon his shoulders so that she had something to brace against.

于是，尽管心有不甘，明日香还是伸出手握住了真嗣的手。他温柔地将她拉起，稳住她的身体，同时小心翼翼地观察着她的表情。她的双腿在伸展时确实抽搐了几下，真嗣几次担心她会因为长时间未使用双腿而瘫倒，但她似乎比他想象的要坚强。她甚至不情愿地将左臂搭在他的肩上，以便有个支撑。

Asuka didn't bother to look Shinji as she said, "This sucks."

明日香没费心去看真嗣，只是说道：“这太糟糕了。”

"Look who's complaining," replied Shinji.

"看看是谁在抱怨，" 真嗣回答道。

"You offered!" yelled Asuka almost directly in Shinji's ear.

"是你自己提议的！" 明日香几乎直接对着真嗣的耳朵大喊。

Shinji ignored her words and started walking over to her side of the fire, though Asuka seemed to have stopped mid step.

真嗣无视她的话，开始向篝火另一边的她走去，尽管明日香似乎在半途中停下了脚步。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji, but he was surprised to see that Asuka was looking up at the sky, and the stars that adorned it.

“你在做什么？”真嗣问道，但他惊讶地发现明日香正仰望着天空，以及点缀其上的星星。

"Its strange to see the stars like this," mumbled Asuka, quite unlike herself. "Without the lights from the city, you would have never guessed they were here."

“这样看星星真奇怪，”明日香喃喃自语，与平时大不相同。“没有城市的灯光，你根本想不到它们就在这里。”

"...I suppose..." said Shinji glancing sideways at Asuka. She was smiling slightly as she looked up at the sky, but as she glanced back down and saw him looking at her, her smile immediately changed to that of a frown.

“……我想也是……”真嗣说着，侧目看向明日香。她微微一笑，仰望着天空，但当她低头看到他正看着她时，笑容立刻变成了皱眉。

"What?" she asked bluntly.

"什么？" 她直截了当地问。

"...I think thats the first time I've seen you smile," said Shinji with a smirk.

"...我想这是我第一次看到你笑，" 真嗣带着一丝戏谑说道。

"Between my leg, this shitty food, not having showered for a week, and waking up with sand in my hair every morning, I don't have much to smile about."

"腿间的疼痛，这糟糕的食物，一周没洗澡，每天早上醒来头发里都是沙子，我实在没什么可笑的。"

"...I was just surprised to see you smile...it was refreshing I guess."

"...我只是有点惊讶看到你笑...我想那让人耳目一新吧。"

Asuka looked passively back at Shinji as he said this, and he didn't need her to tell him that she was angry.

明日香被动地回望着真嗣，当他这么说时，他不需要她告诉他，他知道她在生气。

"If my legs only worked," he thought he heard her mumble.

"如果我的腿还能动，"他觉得自己听到她咕哝道。"

Walking around to her side of the fire, Shinji slowly sat down alongside Asuka and let her gain her balance. Of course, not once did she say thanks for the assistance.

绕到篝火的她那边，真嗣缓缓坐下，让明日香稳住身形。当然，她一次也没有为这份帮助道谢。

Standing back up, he walked back around his side and sat down, before laying down in the cool sand.

他站起身，走回自己的位置坐下，然后躺在凉爽的沙地上。

"Hey Asuka?" he asked quietly.

"嘿，明日香？" 他轻声问道。

Her back was turned away from him as she had already pulled the sleeping bag over her body, so at first he thought she didn't hear him, but eventually she replied.

她背对着他，已经拉过睡袋盖在身上，起初他以为她没听见，但最终她还是回应了。

"What Shinji?" "什么，真嗣？"

Shinji was rather surprised that she had used his name, as he didn't think she had spoken it once since they had introduced each other.

真嗣颇为惊讶她竟然叫了他的名字，因为他记得自从他们互相介绍以来，她似乎一次都没提过他的名字。

"Um...is it possible that people from Nerv are still alive? I mean...if they knew this could possibly happen could they have taken steps to build shelters?"

"嗯……NERV 的人还有可能活着吗？我是说……如果他们预见到这种情况可能发生，会不会采取措施建造避难所？"

Asuka didn't honestly think so. If avoiding Third Impact was so easy, then everyone would have built shelters. Of course, that doesn't really begin to explain how her and Shinji were alive.

明日香并不这么认为。如果避免第三次冲击如此简单，那么所有人都会建造避难所。当然，这还远不足以解释她和真嗣是如何活下来的。

"Maybe, I'm not sure," she replied offhandedly.

“也许吧，我不确定。”她随口答道。

Shinji didn't reply, too absorbed in his own thoughts.

真嗣没有回应，他沉浸在自己的思绪中。

Rolling over on his back, he faced away from Asuka and tried to go to sleep, thoughts of Nerv and his father whirling around in his mind. Across the fire from him, thoughts of her mother filled Asuka, as did her wonderings about Shinji being the Third Child.

翻身仰躺，他背对着明日香，试图入睡，NERV 和父亲的思绪在脑海中盘旋。火堆对面，母亲的形象填满了明日香的心，同时她也在揣测着真嗣是否就是第三适格者。

### Chapter 5: Progression

Refer to previous chapter for stuff I talk about. Although, on another note, anybody see Evangelion 3.0 yet? I know it comes out in the states on the 11 of January (if you can believe IMDB) but anyone see it in Japan?

请参考之前的 chapter 了解我讨论的内容。不过，顺便一提，有人看过《新世纪福音战士 3.0》吗？我知道它在美国是 1 月 11 日上映的（如果你相信 IMDB 的话），但在日本有人看过了吗？

---

Asuka and Shinji seemed to be on friendlier terms the next day as they both spoke that morning, though Shinji did most of the talking. Asuka had even started using Shinji's name to the point that it became natural. Though in what context she used it was an entirely different matter.

第二天，明日香和真嗣似乎关系更融洽了，他们早上都在交谈，尽管大部分是真嗣在说话。明日香甚至开始自然地使用真嗣的名字。不过，她使用这个名字的场合则完全是另一回事。

Shinji cooked breakfast with what he had found the previous day, and Asuka didn't seem to have any complaints about it. They had more rice and a small portion of canned corn each. As they both finished, Shinji went to wash the pot and dishes in the ocean, while Asuka lay back down bored. Now that she was awake and had food in her stomach, she was feeling incredibly restless. She even rather wished she had something to read, just to alleviate the boredom.

真嗣用前一天找到的食材做了早餐，明日香似乎对此并无怨言。他们每人分到了更多的米饭和一小份罐装玉米。吃完后，真嗣去海边洗锅和餐具，而明日香则无聊地躺了回去。现在她醒了，肚子里也有了食物，感到异常焦躁。她甚至宁愿有本书可读，只为缓解这无聊。

As Shinji returned, wiping the silver on his shirt as he went, Asuka turned to him and said-

当真嗣回来时，边走边用衬衫擦拭着银器，明日香转向他，说道——

"So? What were you going to do today?"

“所以？你今天打算做什么？”

Shrugging, Shinji replied, "I don't know. As far as supplies go, we have enough for several days so I won't need to go into the city for a while, not for anything important anyways. Why?"

耸了耸肩，真嗣回答道：“我不知道。就补给而言，我们足够维持好几天，所以我不需要进城，至少不是为了什么重要的事情。怎么了？”

Asuka stared at him for a few seconds before she turned away from him and said, "No particular reason really."

明日香盯着他看了几秒钟，然后转过身去，说道：“真的没什么特别的原因。”

"Well, I was hoping that we could continue our conversation from yesterday...if possible," said Shinji.

“嗯，我希望我们能继续昨天的话题……如果可能的话，”真嗣说。

While Asuka didn't have any problem with this, she didn't want to have to worry about something right now. She had spent a good deal of time thinking about this last night and this morning, but she still couldn't wrap her mind around the fact that Shinji could have been the Third Child. Everything seemed to fit into place it certainly seemed, but she just couldn't imagine this scrawny kid piloting an Evangelion.

虽然明日香对此并无异议，但她现在不想为任何事情操心。昨晚到今早，她花了不少时间思考这个问题，但仍然无法接受真嗣可能是第三适格者的事实。一切似乎都合情合理，但她就是无法想象这个瘦弱的孩子能驾驶 EVA。

"We can talk about that later, I'd rather not have to worry about anything right now."

“我们晚点再谈吧，我现在不想担心任何事。”

As Shinji looked at Asuka's back, he sighed and said, "Okay...well, if you're going to go back to sleep, I suppose I'll go walk the beach for a while."

看着明日香的背影，真嗣叹了口气说：“好吧……既然你要回去睡觉，那我就去海边走走吧。”

'Who said I was going back to sleep?' grumbled Asuka in her mind. Though as Shinji started to walk in the opposite direction, Asuka thought of something.

“谁说我还要回去睡觉的？”明日香在心里咕哝着。然而，当真嗣开始朝相反方向走去时，明日香突然想到了什么。

"Hey Shinji!" “嘿，真嗣！”

Shinji paused and turned around, surprised by the tone in Asuka's voice. He hadn't quite gotten used to her calling him by his name since she had never used it before.

真嗣停下脚步，转过身来，被明日香声音中的语气吓了一跳。自从她之前从未这样叫过他之后，他还没完全习惯她叫他的名字。

"What?" he asked rather nervously. He thought she was angry at him for a second.

"什么？" 他有些紧张地问道。他以为她生他的气了，哪怕只有一瞬间。

Asuka opened her mouth, but nothing came out. The thought had struck her suddenly as she had been lying there, and after last night, it made sense when she thought about. Even so though, asking for Shinji's help was an entirely different thing.

明日香张开嘴，却什么也没说出来。这个念头是她在躺着的时候突然冒出来的，经过昨晚的事情，她觉得这很合理。即便如此，向真嗣求助却是另一回事。

"Wh-Why are you going out walking?" asked Asuka, determined to at least say something.

"为、为什么你要出去散步？" 明日香问道，决心至少要说些什么。

"Is there something wrong with that?" replied Shinji.

"那有什么问题吗？" 真嗣回答道。

"I thought you said you didn't have any reason to today."

"我记得你说过今天没什么理由要出去的。"

"I said I don't have a reason to go into the city, and besides, I like walking. I did do that a lot when I first came to Tokyo-3 before all this happened."

"我说了我没有进城的理由，而且，我喜欢走路。在我刚到第三新东京市的时候，这一切发生之前，我确实经常这么做。"

Asuka bit her lip; was it so hard to just ask?

明日香咬了咬嘴唇；难道就这么难开口吗？

Shinji watched her for a few seconds longer and when she didn't seem to be saying anything else, he started walking again. But Asuka wasn't about to give up so easily.

真嗣又多看了她几秒钟，见她似乎没有再说什么，便重新开始走路。但明日香可没那么容易放弃。

"Hold on a minute! I wasn't done!"

“等一下！我还没说完呢！”

Shinji was almost tempted to ignore her before he turned around again and stared right at her, the fire crackling in between them.

真嗣几乎忍不住要无视她，但最终还是转过身来，直直地盯着她，两人之间火堆噼啪作响。

"Instead of wasting your time walking, I need your help with something."

“与其浪费时间走路，我需要你帮忙做点事。”

The words weren't exactly as Asuka had intended them to be, but she hoped Shinji understood what she meant. Just asking for help from him was taking all of Asuka's willpower. How long had it been since she had asked for help? She couldn't very well ignore the circumstances they were in and was once again reminded that if not for him, she would be dead.

这些话并非完全如明日香所愿，但她希望真嗣能理解她的意思。仅仅是向他求助，就已经耗尽了明日香所有的意志力。她有多久没向人求助了？她无法忽视当前的处境，又一次意识到如果不是因为他，她早已不在人世。

Shinji did understand what she meant, but thought it could have been phrased differently. Even so, he thought it somewhat funny that it had taken her that long to ask for his help.

真嗣确实理解了她的意思，但觉得可以换个说法。即便如此，他觉得她花了这么长时间才向他求助，有点好笑。

"Okay, what is it?" asked Shinji as he started taking a step back towards her.

“好吧，怎么了？” 真嗣一边问，一边开始向后退向她。

"Walking," said Asuka simply.

“散步，”明日香简单地回答。

This made Shinji pause ever so slightly as he continued towards her.

这让真嗣微微一顿，他继续向她走去。

"And if possible, making a set of crutches."

“如果可能的话，再做一副拐杖。”

'How long does she expect this to last?' wondered Shinji.

“她预计这要持续多久？”真嗣暗自思忖。

As Shinji reached the fire again, he crouched down and picked up a bottle of the LCL fluid and downed several mouthfuls. Wiping his mouth on his sleeve he said-

当真嗣再次走近火堆时，他蹲下身，拿起一瓶 LCL 液体，连喝了几大口。用袖子擦了擦嘴，他说道——

"I can help you start walking again easy enough, but I've no idea how crutches are supposed to work."

"我可以帮你重新学会走路，这不难，但我对拐杖怎么用一窍不通。"

"Well luckily I do," said Asuka with a hint of her superiority. Shinji would have dearly liked to egg her on, but decided not to since Asuka seemed serious about this.

"幸运的是我懂，" 明日香带着一丝优越感说道。真嗣本想逗逗她，但看她似乎很认真，便决定不打岔了。

"We can worry about the crutches later I suppose, walking though..." Shinji paused for a minute before he resumed talking. "How do your legs feel?"

“关于拐杖的事，我们稍后再担心吧，先说说走路的事……” 真嗣停顿了一下，然后继续说道。“你的腿感觉怎么样？”

"Same as usual," said Asuka a she ran her hands down her legs. "Same as always," mumbled Asuka, this time with a little bit of sadness in her voice. Whether she had intended this, or if her guard had simply cracked a bit, Shinji couldn't say he enjoyed seeing Asuka saddened like this. Her unmovable legs had become such an normal thing that he had forgotten how much of an inconvenience it must be for her. Not to mention she seemed to be the kind of person who preferred doing things themselves.

“和平时一样，”明日香一边说，一边用手抚摸着自己的双腿。“一如既往，”明日香这次低声说道，声音中带着一丝悲伤。无论这是否是她有意为之，还是她的防线稍稍松动，真嗣看到明日香这样难过，心里并不好受。她那无法移动的双腿已经变得如此平常，以至于他忘记了这对她来说是多么的不便。更不用说她似乎是那种更喜欢自己做事的人。

"I'm honestly not sure how much help it'll be," said Shinji eventually, "but if you need help walking, I can do that much."

“老实说，我不确定这能有多大帮助，”真嗣最终说道，“但如果你需要帮助走路，我可以做到这一点。”

"Yeah," replied Asuka rather offhandedly, not quite meeting Shinji's eyes.

“嗯，”明日香有些漫不经心地回答，眼神并未完全与真嗣对视。

Walking around to her side of the fire, Shinji bent down next to Asuka, letting her put an arm around his back and resting it on his shoulder. They both seemed to be aware of how close they were, but neither said anything about it. If they were going to be living together like this for a while, stuff like this was only assumed.

真嗣绕到火堆的另一边，蹲在明日香身旁，让她可以把手臂搭在自己的背上，靠在他的肩膀上。两人似乎都意识到了彼此的距离有多近，但谁也没有提及。如果他们要这样一起生活一段时间，这种事情只是理所当然的。

Shinji slowly stood up as Asuka seemed to gather more strength, only moving as fast as she did, His body was more or less something that she could hold her weight against as she pushed herself upwards. Shinji didn't know whether Asuka was in any pain or not, but knew that even if she was, she wouldn't cry in pain, let him know, or even let it show on her face. She was just that stubborn. This brought a smile to his face, which Asuka did notice, considering how close there faces were.

随着明日香似乎恢复了些力气，真嗣缓缓站起身，动作仅与她同步。他的身体成了她支撑自己站起来的依靠。真嗣不知道明日香是否感到疼痛，但他知道，即使她疼，她也不会哭喊，不会让他知道，甚至不会在脸上显露出来。她就是那么倔强。这让真嗣露出了微笑，明日香也注意到了，毕竟他们的脸靠得那么近。

"What?" she asked rather snappishly, thinking that he was amused at how much difficulty she was having.

“什么？”她有些不耐烦地问道，以为他在嘲笑她遇到的困难有多大。

"No, nothing," replied Shinji hurriedly.

“不，没什么，”真嗣连忙回答。

"Instead of grinning like an idiot then, how about you help me?" complained Asuka, her anger starting to flare.

"与其那时像个傻子一样傻笑，不如来帮我一把？"明日香抱怨道，怒火开始升腾。

'Or I could just dump you on your ass,' thought Shinji for a brief moment, but he wasn't about to do such a spiteful thing.

'或者我可以直接把你摔个屁股蹲儿，' 真嗣脑海中闪过这个念头，但他并不打算做出如此恶意的事情。

Shinji brought his own hand up then and braced it against her back, being sure that she wouldn't fall over. As usual, he was amazed at how cool and smooth the fabric felt as he touched her odd clothes.

真嗣随后抬起自己的手，撑在她的背上，确保她不会摔倒。一如既往地，他惊叹于那奇异衣料在他触摸下所感受到的凉爽与光滑。

"Okay," mumbled Asuka as she took several short pauses before she forced herself upward, standing on both her legs. They still didn't seem to want to listen to her, because she would have gone crashing back to the ground if not for Shinji's hand on her back. Shinji didn't say a word of this, because he could tell that Asuka was seething from seeming so helpless. He had quickly learned when to speak his mind and when to keep quiet.

"好吧，"明日香咕哝着，在强迫自己站起来之前停顿了几次，双脚站立。它们似乎仍然不听使唤，要不是真嗣的手扶在她背上，她早就摔回地上了。真嗣对此一言不发，因为他看得出明日香正因显得如此无助而怒火中烧。他很快就学会了何时该直言不讳，何时该保持沉默。

'Right, I can do this,' thought Asuka as she stood haphazardly upright. Was this what a newborn felt as they learned to walk? Asuka couldn't imagine it being very different.

'对，我能做到，' 明日香一边想着，一边摇摇晃晃地站直了身子。新生儿学走路时就是这种感觉吗？明日香无法想象会有多大差别。

Feeling incredibly stupid, she declared to Shinji, "I'm going to try walking forward."

她感到无比愚蠢，对真嗣宣布道："我要试着向前走。"

'Don't push yourself,' was at the forefront of Shinji's mind, but he held his tongue and instead replied, "Alright..."

“别勉强自己”是真嗣脑海中最先浮现的想法，但他忍住了没说出口，而是回答道："好吧..."

Just lifting her leg seemed to take great amounts of effort and strain and Asuka was beginning to wonder if the nerves in her legs were no longer receiving pulses from the brain. Eventually though, she did manage to take one step forward. What she didn't want to admit was that without Shinji, she wouldn't have even made it a quarter this far.

仅仅是抬起腿似乎就耗费了巨大的努力和紧张，明日香开始怀疑她腿部的神经是否已经不再接收大脑的脉冲信号。不过最终，她还是设法向前迈出了一步。她不愿承认的是，如果没有真嗣，她甚至无法走到现在的四分之一距离。

Her legs were starting to catch fire it seems as her muscles screamed out at her. Pain wasn't anything new to her by any means, but even so, it still hurt. And after the pain she had felt while Shinji and herself had parted briefly, well, she didn't want to experience anything like that ever again. Knowing that her muscles wouldn't be able to take the strain much longer, she relented and said to Shinji-

她的双腿似乎开始燃烧，肌肉向她发出痛苦的呐喊。疼痛对她来说并不新鲜，但即便如此，依然很痛。在真嗣和她短暂分别时所感受到的痛苦之后，她再也不想经历类似的事情了。意识到她的肌肉无法承受更长时间的紧张，她让步了，对真嗣说——

"I think thats as much as I can do right now."

“我想我现在只能做到这样了。”

Shinji was rather surprised that she had accomplished even that much, but he had to put his mind into things elsewhere as Asuka seemed to collapse in his arms as the energy left her body. He was now holding her entirely up by his own body, though it wasn't as though she was very heavy to begin with. Gently lowering her back to the sleeping bag, Asuka didn't say a word of thanks as she was either too tired, or too embarrassed by what had transpired. Shinji couldn't tell which though.

真嗣颇为惊讶她竟然能做到这一步，但他的思绪不得不转移到其他事情上，因为明日香似乎在他怀里失去了力气，瘫软下来。他现在完全靠自己的身体支撑着她，尽管她原本就不算重。他轻轻地将她放回睡袋，明日香没有说一句感谢的话，可能是因为太累了，或者是因为刚才发生的事情感到尴尬。真嗣无法判断是哪一种。

After doing this, he retreated to his own side of the fire and sat down, all thoughts of going on his own walk gone. It wasn't as though he was tired, but after seeing Asuka put in the effort of moving her legs, he couldn't very well go off and leave her, at least, this is what he thought.

做完这些后，他退回到火堆的另一边坐下，原本打算独自散步的念头已经消失无踪。他并不觉得累，但看到明日香努力移动双腿的样子，他实在无法就这样离开她，至少，他是这么想的。

They both lapsed into a long silence and Asuka seemed to go to sleep, exhausted after what had happened, leaving Shinji to fumble with his own thoughts.

他们俩都陷入了长时间的沉默，明日香似乎在经历了这一切后疲惫地睡着了，留下真嗣独自摸索着自己的思绪。

Later in the evening, Asuka woke again, feeling well rested and more importantly hungry; it seemed that her temper had returned as well. Shinji hurriedly made dinner consisting of much the same as they had had the previous night. Asuka seemed to realize that complaining wasn't going to do her any good, so she barely opened her mouth to speak during dinner.

傍晚时分，明日香再次醒来，感觉休息得很好，更重要的是饿了；看来她的脾气也回来了。真嗣急忙做了晚餐，内容与前一晚大致相同。明日香似乎意识到抱怨对她没有任何好处，所以在晚餐期间她几乎没怎么开口说话。

After Shinji had finished cleaning up though, he was hoping that she would now be in a mood to talk.

然而，当真嗣收拾完毕后，他希望明日香现在能有心情聊聊。

"Hey Asuka?" asked Shinji as he returned from the ocean.

“嘿，明日香？” 真嗣从海边回来时问道。

"What?" she replied without looking at him. She was laying down on her back and looking up at the sky blankly. Evening was starting to turn into night.

“什么？” 她没有看他，回答道。她正仰面躺着，茫然地望着天空。傍晚渐渐转为夜晚。

"Can we continue from yesterday?"

"我们能从昨天继续吗？"

"Continue what?" asked Asuka with a slight sneer in her voice.

"继续什么？" 明日香带着一丝嘲讽的语气问道。

'How was it that she was able to flip personalities so easily?' wondered Shinji.

“她怎么能如此轻易地转换性格呢？”真嗣疑惑道。

"Yesterday, when we were talking about Third Impact and Nerv and everything," said Shinji feeling sorta stupid. He still didn't know much about either of these things, but he was hoping that Asuka was going to tell him more.

“昨天，我们聊到第三次冲击和 NERV 以及所有那些事情的时候，”真嗣有些尴尬地说道。他对于这些事情了解得并不多，但他希望明日香能告诉他更多。

"Hmph," grumbled Asuka as she closed her eyes and opened them in annoyance, though she couldn't really ignore this either; she had some questions for Shinji herself.

“哼，”明日香咕哝着，闭上眼睛又带着不悦睁开，尽管她也无法真正忽视这一点；她自己也有问题想问真嗣。

"Fine then," said Asuka as she sat up, wrapping the sleeping bag around her body as she did so and scooted closer to the fire. "But first I want to ask you something myself."

“好吧，”明日香说着坐起身，用睡袋裹住自己，挪近火堆。“但首先我想问你一些事情。”

Shinji was rather surprised at this, but he nodded his head all the same and said, "Okay, what?"

真嗣对此颇感意外，但他还是点了点头，问道：“好吧，什么？”

"Tell me what Nerv does."

告诉我 NERV 是做什么的。

Shinji thought he misheard her.

真嗣以为自己听错了。

"Huh?" he gaped. "How can I tell you when I don't even know myself?"

"啊？" 他目瞪口呆。"我自己都不知道，怎么告诉你？"

"Your own father is the director of Nerv. Certainly you must have some idea of what he does," said Asuka almost bored.

"你自己的父亲是 NERV 的指挥官。你肯定对他做的事情有些了解，" 明日香几乎有些不耐烦地说。

"I told you, he never mentioned anything about his work at any point in time to me."

"我告诉过你，他从未在任何时候向我提起过他的工作。"

"Fine then. In your own words, tell me what Nerv does."

"那好吧。用你自己的话，告诉我 Nerv 是做什么的。"

'That was almost just as hard,' thought Shinji.

'这几乎同样困难，'真嗣心想。

"Well...if I had to guess, it would have something to do with Tokyo-3 I suppose. And you said before that Nerv might have had a hand in what happened here so...human experiments...of some kind, I guess?"

"嗯...如果非要猜的话，我想可能和第三新东京市有关吧。而且你之前提到过，NERV 可能与此地发生的事情有关，所以...大概是某种...人体实验之类的吧？"

Asuka watched him for several seconds, the fire flickering in her ocean blue eyes before she shrugged and said, "Well, its not like I expected anything better from someone who doesn't know anything."

明日香盯着他看了好几秒，眼中跳动的火焰映衬着她深海般的蓝眸，随后她耸了耸肩说道：“哼，我也没指望一个什么都不知道的人能说出什么有价值的东西。”

'So then tell me already damn it,' thought Shinji angrily. But he waited patiently nonetheless.

'那就快点告诉我啊，该死的，' 真嗣心中愤怒地想着。但他还是耐心地等待着。

Asuka still seemed to be gauging him though, trying to decide whether he could have been the Third Child or not. The possibility was slim certainly...but...

明日香似乎仍在评估他，试图判断他是否可能是第三适格者。这种可能性确实微乎其微...但...

"You said before that when your father had you come here to Tokyo-3, he didn't say a word about what he wanted you here for?"

"你之前说过，你父亲让你来第三新东京市时，他什么都没告诉你他为什么让你来这里？"

"Nothing," replied Shinji with a nod.

"什么都没说，" 真嗣点头回答道。

Asuka bit her lip, stubbornly refusing to believe what her mind was starting to shift towards.

明日香咬着嘴唇，固执地拒绝相信她的思绪开始转向的念头。

'Well, whether it mattered then, it doesn't matter anymore,' Asuka told herself. 'So mentioning it now is entirely pointless probably.'

“好吧，无论当时是否重要，现在都无关紧要了，”明日香自言自语道，“所以现在提起它大概毫无意义。”

Probably, but not necessarily.

或许吧，但未必如此。

Asuka ignored this other part of her mind telling her otherwise.

明日香无视了内心另一个声音的反驳。

After Asuka finished asking Shinji her questions, she dived in telling him everything about Nerv. The angels, the Evangelion, the children selected for the process, herself, Rei, the individual responsibilities of the personal, the reason only children born after Second Impact could pilot the Evangelions. She covered everything that she had been taught in Germany. She even told him about the function of the LCL fluid and the feel of being in the entry plug. It was enough to make Shinji's head swim.

在明日香向真嗣问完她的问题后，她开始滔滔不绝地向他讲述关于 NERV 的一切。使徒、福音战士、被选中的孩子们、她自己、丽、每个人的职责、为什么只有第二次冲击后出生的孩子才能驾驶福音战士。她把自己在德国所学的一切都告诉了他。她甚至向他解释了 LCL 液体的功能以及进入插入栓时的感觉。这些信息多到让真嗣感到头晕目眩。

As Asuka finished explaining everything, she let out a low sigh and took several large mouthfuls of water. As she did so, Shinji remembered that they had been drinking that stuff this entire time. He suddenly felt like retching.

当明日香解释完一切后，她轻轻叹了口气，大口喝了几口水。与此同时，真嗣想起来他们一直在喝这种东西。他突然感到一阵恶心。

As Asuka set her bottle down she raised an eyebrow and said, "Well, believe me or not?"

当明日香放下瓶子时，她挑了挑眉，说道：“好吧，信不信由你？”

"I'm not sure," mumbled Shinji, his head still a jumble of everything. If she was lying again, then it was the the worst lie in the world. But Shinji didn't think it could have been anything but the truth.

"我不确定，" 真嗣咕哝着，他的思绪依旧一片混乱。如果她又在撒谎，那这将是世界上最糟糕的谎言。但真嗣不认为那可能不是真的。

"Why would I lie about something like this? What would I have to gain?"

"我为什么要对这种事撒谎？我能从中得到什么？"

"Nothing I guess," said Shinji, "But...even so, its rather far fetched."

"我想什么也没有，" 真嗣说，"但是...即便如此，这也太离奇了。"

"Believe it or don't, it doesn't really make any difference now though."

信不信由你，现在这真的没什么区别了。

"Doesn't it? I would have figured that these angels probably caused Third Impact."

难道不是吗？我本以为这些天使可能引发了第三次冲击。

Asuka had forgotten about that, and it showed on her face. Guess Shinji wasn't as stupid as she was being led to believe.

明日香已经忘记了那件事，她的脸上显露无疑。看来真嗣并不像她被引导相信的那样愚蠢。

"Yes, that is probably the truth of it," sighed Asuka. "But there isn't anyway to know if that is what actually happened."

“是的，那很可能是真相，”明日香叹息道，“但我们无法知道那是否真的发生了。”

"But they could come back," said Shinji, suddenly feeling very worried. "If everybody is gone because of these angel things, maybe they would come back for us."

“但他们可能会回来，”真嗣突然感到非常担忧，“如果所有人因为这些天使而消失，也许他们会回来找我们。”

'Tail right between his legs,' thought Asuka with a slight grin.

"'尾巴夹得紧紧的，' 明日香心中暗想，嘴角微微上扬。

"Worrying about it isn't going to do us any good though," shrugged Asuka.

"“担心也没用，”明日香耸耸肩，“反正对我们没好处。”

Shinji seemed that he would like to argue back, but Asuka was starting to glare at him, so he was forced to shut his mouth. Still, something wasn't making sense to him. Asuka was supposed to fight these angel things in something called an Evangelion that was similar to a giant robot. If the angels had attacked Tokyo-3 and Nerv, then why was she here? Had she been unable to stop there attack, or had she never been deployed to attack in the first place? The plug suit that she wore was evidence enough that she had been preparing for something she had told him, but other than that, she didn't know anything else. Course it was the same with him. A part of his memory seemed to have been scooped out of him.

真嗣似乎想反驳，但明日香已经开始瞪他了，他只好闭嘴。不过，有些事情他还是想不通。明日香本该驾驶名为 EVA 的巨型机器人与使徒战斗。如果使徒已经袭击了第三新东京市和 NERV，那她为什么还在这里？是她没能阻止袭击，还是根本就没被派去战斗？她穿的插入栓服足以证明她曾为某事做准备，除此之外，她一无所知。他也是一样，记忆中的一部分仿佛被挖走了。

"Asu-"

"Now what?" she groaned as she turned back towards him. After she had finished talking, she had laid down and turned away from him.

"现在怎么办？" 她呻吟着转回身面对他。说完话后，她躺下并背对着他。

"Is it possible that my dad wanted me to do something at Nerv...thats why he asked me to come to Tokyo-3. You said before that only a child born after Second Impact could pilot an Evangelion. Could I have done that?"

"有没有可能我爸爸希望我在 NERV 做些什么...这就是他让我来东京-3 的原因。你之前说过，只有第二次冲击后出生的孩子才能驾驶 EVA。我会不会也能做到呢？"

Asuka's first inclination was to scream 'no' at him and then laugh at him for even suggesting such a ludicrous thing, but everything seemed to point in the opposite direction.

明日香的第一反应本是大声对他喊“不”，然后嘲笑他竟会提出如此荒谬的建议，但所有迹象似乎都指向了相反的方向。

Without turning back to look at him, she mumbled, "I think so. Maybe that was what your father wanted you here for, but maybe not. Without anything more solid than that, I can't really say."

她没有回头看他，只是含糊地嘀咕道：“我想是的。也许这就是你父亲让你来这里的原因，但也可能不是。没有更确凿的证据，我实在无法断言。”

Shinji didn't reply to that, wondering if that was what she really thought. Asuka didn't seem to be in any mood to talk anymore though, because she had passed into a deep sleep, sighing softly.

真嗣没有回应，不知道这是否是她真正的想法。但明日香似乎已经没有心情再聊下去了，因为她已经沉沉睡去，轻轻叹了口气。

Shinji was still thinking about the Evangelions as Asuka had told him about them, and wondering what it would have been like to pilot them. Asuka hadn't elaborated on what it was like, only describing them in brief detail as was needed, but Shinji had an idea that it wasn't easy.

真嗣仍在思考明日香告诉他的关于 EVA 的事情，想象着驾驶它们会是什么感觉。明日香并没有详细描述驾驶的感受，只是简略地提到了一些必要的细节，但真嗣隐约觉得那并不容易。

Things were still bothering him though, and it wasn't so much about the gap in his memory, or the fact that he could have been an Evangelion pilot like Asuka. No, it just seemed that everything was too perfect. Before, he thought that Asuka and himself met each other by happenstance, but after the past two days, he wasn't so sure. Both of them were eerily similar in ways that Shinji couldn't explain, and then there was the connection that they had with Nerv. If it wasn't happenstance, and they had been thrown together like this on purpose.

尽管如此，有些事情仍然困扰着他，并非关于记忆中的空白，或是他可能像明日香一样成为 EVA 驾驶员的事实。不，只是这一切似乎太过完美了。以前，他以为自己和明日香的相遇纯属偶然，但经过过去的两天，他不再那么确定。他们之间有着难以言喻的惊人相似，以及与 NERV 之间那层联系。如果不是偶然，而是有意将他们如此安排在一起的话。

Why though? That was the question...

可为什么呢？这便是问题所在……

But Shinji didn't have an answer to that, nor did he think he'd acquire that answer anytime in the future.

但真嗣对此没有答案，也不认为将来会找到答案。

The days passed more slowly then it seemed. But everyday, Shinji helped Asuka steadily move forward more. It seemed she was adamant on doing this, and even after falling one time in which Shinji hadn't managed to catch her, she didn't seem put off in the last, but simply asked for him to help her back up. She was regaining her strength quickly, much to Shinji's astonishment, but Asuka didn't seem to be surprised in the least. She had always been athletic, so something of this nature was only natural for her. They had even decided to give up on the idea of making crutches. Each day she got farther and farther in her steps, and it seemed that her eventual goal seemed to be the ocean. It got to the point that Shinji didn't have to worry about her falling as much, and Asuka seemed to be glad that he let her walk on her own now, though he was still keeping a careful eye on her just in case she rebounded. She wasn't sure whether to be thankful or annoyed, though she still hadn't said her thanks yet, so Shinji usually got the annoyed part.

日子似乎过得更慢了。但每一天，真嗣都帮助明日香稳步前进。她似乎决心这么做，甚至在有一次真嗣没能接住她而摔倒后，她并没有气馁，只是简单地要求他扶她起来。她恢复力量的速度让真嗣惊讶，但明日香似乎一点也不意外。她一直都很擅长运动，所以这种事情对她来说很自然。他们甚至放弃了制作拐杖的想法。每天她都能走得更远，她的最终目标似乎是大海。到了真嗣不必太担心她会摔倒的地步，明日香似乎很高兴他现在让她自己走，尽管他仍然小心翼翼地看着她以防万一她再次摔倒。她不确定是该感谢还是感到烦恼，尽管她还没有说出感谢的话，所以真嗣通常会感受到她的烦恼。

On the last day, during which she finally made it to the ocean, she had told Shinji that she wanted to do this entirely on her own, and that if he helped her, she would hit him. Asuka's verbal abuse seemed to have grown to physical now as well, because she didn't seem to mind hitting him if he annoyed her. Though the only time she ever did was during these walks since this was the only time they were particularly close to each other. Shinji thought he caught her smiling sometimes when she hit him though, and he didn't seem to mind that much as well. Her blows stung at first, but quickly subsided. He had never really noticed how small her hands were until then.

在最后一天，她终于抵达了海洋，她告诉真嗣她想完全靠自己完成这件事，如果他帮忙，她会揍他。明日香的言语攻击似乎也升级到了肢体层面，因为她似乎并不介意在他惹恼她时动手。尽管她只在这些散步时才会这样做，因为这是他们唯一特别亲近的时刻。真嗣觉得有时她打他时似乎在笑，而他对此也不太介意。她的拳头起初刺痛，但很快消退。直到那时，他才真正注意到她的手有多小。

Though she still moved slow, and running seemed to be outside her possibilities right now, she didn't have any problems walking right now. Shinji had been wondering why Asuka's legs hadn't been working for a while, but she explained it simply, saying that if they weren't used, they would atrophy. Shinji didn't think it was just this reason, but he let it slide for now.

尽管她依旧行动缓慢，跑步似乎超出了她目前的极限，但她现在走路完全没有问题。真嗣一直纳闷为什么明日香的双腿有一阵子不能动了，但她简单地解释说，如果不使用，肌肉就会萎缩。真嗣觉得原因不止如此，但他暂时没有深究。

After what seemed to take an entire hour, Asuka finally made it to the surf of Tokyo-3 and sat down, letting the surf wash over her feet.

仿佛过了一个世纪那么久，明日香终于抵达了第三新东京市的浪边，坐下来，任由海浪冲刷着她的双脚。

'She seems to be enjoying herself,' thought Shinji as he walked up behind her and stood there, looking out across the ocean. This was the only time that they really talked much. Asuka told him what it was like to work at Nerv, and what the people were like there. Shinji had asked her what his father was like, but to that Asuka couldn't answer that. She had only met the commander a handful of times afterall. Shinji on the other hand told Asuka about the places he'd been to, all the different school he'd gone to, and the many roommates he'd had. Though she seemed bored most of the time, he suspected she liked hearing something at least while she walked.

'她似乎很享受，'真嗣心想，他走到她身后，站在那里，眺望着大海。这是他们真正交谈最多的时候。明日香告诉他 Nerv 的工作是什么样的，那里的人又是怎样的。真嗣问过她父亲是什么样的人，但对此明日香无法回答。毕竟，她只见过指挥官几次而已。而真嗣则向明日香讲述了他去过的那些地方，所有不同的学校，以及他曾有过的许多室友。尽管她大部分时间看起来很无聊，但他猜想她至少在散步时喜欢听些东西。

"I didn't think I'd be returning to this spot like this," said Asuka in quite voice after a few seconds.

“我从没想过会以这种方式回到这个地方，”几秒钟后，明日香轻声说道。

"Hmm?" asked Shinji confused.

"嗯？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

Asuka was silent again, seeming unable to speak what was on her mind.

明日香再次沉默，似乎无法说出她心中的想法。

"When you left before, I crawled over here to get water, knowing I wouldn't last long without it. I don't even know how long ago that was now."

"上次你离开后，我知道没有水我撑不了多久，就爬过来取水。我现在甚至不知道那是多久以前的事了。"

"More than a week," said Shinji. It was starting to become difficult to tell the days apart. He had no idea what month it even was anymore.

“超过一周了。” 真嗣说道。日子开始变得难以区分。他甚至不知道现在是什么月份了。

"It seems longer," sighed Asuka as she wrapped her arms around her legs as she sat there. Shinji decided to sit down beside her then, there arms brushing against each other as he did. Asuka no longer flinched at the contact like she used to.

“感觉更久。” 明日香叹息着，双臂环抱双腿坐在那里。真嗣决定坐在她旁边，他们的手臂轻轻碰触。明日香不再像以前那样对这种接触感到退缩。

"How much longer are we going to be here?" wondered Asuka.

“我们还要在这里待多久？” 明日香问道。

"On this beach?" asked Shinji.

"在这片海滩上？" 真嗣问道。

"No, Tokyo-3," snapped Asuka, her patience wearing thin. Shinji wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic or not though.

"不，第三新东京市，" 明日香厉声说道，她的耐心正在消磨殆尽。真嗣不确定她是否在讽刺。

"I don't know...why?" "我不知道...为什么？"

"I'm sick of it here," she grumbled.

"我受够了这里，" 她咕哝着。

Shinji supposed he was as well now that she mentioned it. But where would they go instead?

碇真嗣想了想，既然她提到了，自己现在也确实如此。但他们会去哪儿呢？

There previous supplies had dwindled several days ago. Asuka seemed to be eating twice as much than before she started walking, and though Shinji wasn't about to point this out to her, he knew it would be a problem. So after helping her along one afternoon, he spent much of the evening looking for more supplies, and he had come back rather successful. He had spent so much time sleeping restlessly on the sand that he had forgotten what it had been like to be warm, but that was before he found the second sleeping bag.

之前的补给早在几天前就已所剩无几。明日香似乎比开始徒步前吃得多了两倍，尽管真嗣不打算向她指出这一点，但他知道这会是个问题。于是在某个下午帮她前行后，他花了不少时间在晚上寻找更多补给，并相当成功地返回了。他在沙滩上辗转反侧、难以入眠的日子里，几乎忘记了温暖的感觉是怎样的，但那是在他找到第二个睡袋之前的事了。

He had luckily found another department store and spent a good deal of time going through the place. The building was largely intact with only small sections of the roof having crumbled away, but it was nothing terrible. Shinji had found a proper spit for which to cook on now as well along with a cutting knife. He hadn't used the knife yet, but he had wished he had had it several days before. He had stocked up on more canned food at the store as well, packing everything he could find in the camping backpack.

幸运的是，他找到了另一家百货商店，并在那里花了大量时间仔细搜寻。建筑大体完好，只有屋顶的小部分坍塌，但并不严重。真嗣找到了一个合适的烤架，还找到了一把切肉刀。他还没用过那把刀，但他希望几天前就有它。他在商店里补充了更多罐头食品，把能找到的东西都塞进了露营背包。

The first day back from this he had enjoyed his time cooking dinner now that he had more to work with. Even Asuka was pleasantly surprised by the dinner, and even ventured to ask Shinji why he knew so much about cooking, though his explanation might have been a little long for her tastes.

从那回来的第一天，他享受着用更多工具烹饪晚餐的乐趣。就连明日香也对晚餐感到惊喜，甚至好奇地问真嗣为什么对烹饪如此了解，尽管他的解释可能对她来说有点冗长。

The prospect of leaving the beach though, Shinji thought while sitting next to Asuka wasn't something that he had really considered. Certainly it was a possibility now that Asuka seemed to be able to walk, if rather slowly. But where would they go exactly? Leaving Tokyo-3 was assumed, but other than that he didn't really have an idea.

坐在明日香旁边的真嗣思考着离开海滩的可能性，他其实并没有真正考虑过。当然，现在明日香似乎能走路了，尽管很慢，但离开海滩是可能的。但他们究竟会去哪里呢？离开第三新东京市是必然的，但除此之外，他并没有具体的想法。

And Shinji didn't think that either of them were quite prepared for that journey. He looked sideways at Asuka then, watching her silently as the ocean wind calmly blew her hair out behind her. He preferred things like this if he had to be honest.

而真嗣并不认为他们中的任何一人已准备好踏上这段旅程。他侧目望向明日香，静静地注视着她，任由海风轻柔地吹拂起她的发丝。若要坦诚相待，他更偏爱这样的时刻。

"Well, I think I've had enough of the cold," said Asuka as she made to get up. Standing up seemed to be the most difficult part for Asuka, as her legs seemed to lose there strength if she kept them idle for too long, but once she was moving she was usually okay.

“好吧，我觉得我已经受够了这寒冷，”明日香说着准备起身。站起来对明日香来说似乎是最困难的部分，因为她的腿如果长时间不动就会失去力气，但一旦她开始移动，通常就没问题了。

Shinji stood up alongside her, which was probably a good thing as Asuka lost her balance slightly, and Shinji had to prevent her from falling. Still no word of thanks though escaped her lips.

真嗣也跟着她站起来，这可能是件好事，因为明日香稍稍失去了平衡，真嗣不得不防止她摔倒。不过，她嘴里还是没有说出感谢的话。

They walked back in silence, seeming to go faster then when they had walked out to the ocean. The fire was steadily roaring as they got back, and Shinji piled more dry wood on it. He was starting to have to walk much farther if he wanted wood that was usable.

他们默默地走回去，似乎比去海边时走得更快。当他们回来时，篝火正熊熊燃烧，真嗣又在上面加了一些干木头。如果他想找到可用的木头，现在不得不走得更远了。

Asuka predictably sat down and buried herself under the sleeping, shivering slightly from the cold while Shinji started working on dinner. He was just wondering what he should make when Asuka spoke to him.

正如预料的那样，明日香坐了下来，将自己埋在睡袋里，微微颤抖着抵御寒冷，而真嗣则开始准备晚餐。他正琢磨着该做些什么时，明日香开口对他说话了。

"Hey Shinji." “嘿，真嗣。”

"Huh?" he replied as he looked at the can of spam he held. He couldn't say he was a fan of the stuff, he had some seasoning which would help mask the taste.

“嗯？”他应声抬头，目光落在手中的午餐肉罐头上。他并不怎么喜欢这东西，但幸好有些调料能掩盖那味道。

"That place you found the food and sleeping bag at..."

"你找到食物和睡袋的那个地方……"

"What about it?" "那又怎样？"

"Did it have clothes as well?"

"那里也有衣服吗？"

Shinji had to think about this for a minute. Clothes were far from his mind if he was honest, even though the ones he was wearing couldn't have been in the best shape. But he did think he remembered seeing a section for them.

真嗣不得不花点时间思考这个问题。说实话，衣服远不在他的考虑范围内，尽管他现在穿的这些肯定状态不佳。但他确实记得似乎看到过有卖衣服的区域。

"Yeah I think there was," he replied.

“嗯，我想应该是有的，”他回答道。

"Could you go back there tomorrow and get me a few things?"

“你明天能回去帮我拿几件吗？”

"I guess..." he said rather offhandedly. Why did she suddenly want clothes?

"我想……" 他有些随意地说道。她怎么突然想要衣服了？

"Good, because this beach isn't the only thing I'm sick of."

"好，因为这个海滩不是我唯一厌倦的东西。"

It took a few seconds for it to click in Shinji's mind.

过了几秒钟，真嗣才反应过来。

"...That plug suit thing," he hesitated.

"...那件紧身衣，"他犹豫地说道。

"Now that I can walk okay I'd prefer to not be wearing this thing either. It prevents cold from seeping in well enough, but sleeping in it isn't very fun."

"既然我现在走路没问题，我也不想再穿这玩意儿了。它确实能很好地防止寒冷侵入，但穿着它睡觉可不怎么舒服。"

"I see," said Shinji after a few seconds.

“我明白了。”几秒钟后，真嗣说道。

Across the fire, Asuka was watching him with a blank stare on her face, though this stare quickly turned in a grin.

火堆对面，明日香面无表情地盯着他，但很快这表情就转变成了一个笑容。

"What's wrong, don't feel comfortable picking out clothes for a girl?"

“怎么了，给女孩子挑衣服不自在吗？”

"Thats not it," said Shinji at once, leaving little doubt that that was the case.

“不是那样的，”真嗣立刻说道，尽管这无疑就是事实。

Asuka almost laughed at his childish embarrassment.

明日香几乎要笑出声来，他的孩子气窘迫样子。

"Trust me, if I could walk there myself, I would, and not have to send you instead. Judging from what you're wearing, fashion isn't something you've ever heard of. I've never seen a more boring choice of clothes."

“相信我，如果我能自己走过去，我会的，不必派你代劳。看你这身打扮，时尚这词儿你恐怕听都没听过。我从没见过比这更乏味的衣着选择了。”

"What do you want there?" asked Shinji, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice.

"你在那儿想要什么？" 真嗣问道，努力不让声音中流露出苦涩。

"Shirt, pants, sweatshirt, socks, and shoes. Nothing else." Asuka was was very adamant about this last part.

"衬衫，裤子，运动衫，袜子，还有鞋子。别的什么都没有。" 对于这最后一点，明日香非常坚持。

"Fine, I'll get them," said Shinji grumbling slightly.

"好吧，我去拿。" 真嗣略带抱怨地说道。

"Isn't dinner ready yet?"

"晚饭还没好吗？"

"You could help for a change."

"你也可以换换手帮忙。"

"Why? Its more fun watching," smirked Asuka.

"为什么？看热闹更有趣嘛，" 明日香微微一笑。

'Just because she can walk, she's acting all superior now,' thought Shinji as he threw several ingredients into the pot. He had eventually settled on a stew, as there wasn't anything else he could really make with the spam.

'就因为她能走路了，现在就摆出一副高高在上的样子，' 真嗣一边想，一边将几种食材扔进锅里。他最终决定做炖菜，因为除了午餐肉，他实在不知道还能做什么。

After another thirty minutes of cooking, the stew was done. They still had to eat out of the pot, as Shinji hadn't picked up any bowls, which reminded him he should look for dishes tomorrow when he returned to the store.

又过了三十分钟，炖菜做好了。他们还是得直接从锅里吃，因为真嗣没拿碗，这让他想起明天去商店时应该找找餐具。

They both finished up dinner and Shinji rinsed the pot and the forks that he had gotten before. Asuka was just complaining that she could use a shower when Shinji returned from the ocean and simply pointed towards it. Asuka glared at him but didn't say anything before she buried herself back under the sleeping bag. A shower would be good, but hot water was a bit of a commodity.

两人吃完晚餐后，真嗣清洗了之前拿来的锅和叉子。明日香正抱怨说她需要洗个澡，这时真嗣从海边回来，只是朝那边指了指。明日香瞪了他一眼，但什么也没说，就又钻回了睡袋里。洗个澡是不错，但热水可是稀缺资源。

Shinji lay down in his own sleeping bag, using his own arm as a pillow. He wasn't sure, and couldn't really explain it, but he felt like things would be changing slowly now. Rolling over onto his side, he closed his and went to sleep, dreading what tomorrow would bring.

真嗣躺进自己的睡袋，用胳膊当枕头。他不确定，也无法解释，但感觉事情会慢慢发生变化。翻身侧躺，他闭上眼睛，沉沉睡去，对明天将要发生的事感到忧虑。

Shinji had now spent so much time scrounging through cars and buildings that he was tempted to draw a map, but at the same time he seemed to have one in the back of his head. The department store was a good ways away from the beach, so certainly taking Asuka here so she could look at the clothes herself was out of the question, but he wished she would have given him a better idea of what she wanted. He didn't think that anything he'd chose she would really like to begin with.

真嗣已经花了太多时间在汽车和建筑物中搜寻，他甚至想画张地图，但同时他似乎脑子里已经有了一个。百货商店离海滩相当远，所以带明日香亲自来挑选衣服显然是不可能的，但他希望她能给他一个更明确的指示。他不认为他选的任何东西她会真的喜欢。

The store in question was off a highway it seemed, and was fairly well known, but Shinji didn't know the name of it. The sign out front had been crushed to fine dust it seemed. The parking lot was mildly large with many cars parked within the lot. These Shinji had gone through as well as he had first passed through. He had learned that it was best to check every possible place for anything useful, even if it was unlikely he'd find anything.

这家商店似乎位于一条高速公路旁，相当有名，但真嗣并不知道它的名字。门前的招牌似乎已被碾成细尘。停车场相当大，里面停着许多车。真嗣在第一次经过时也检查了这些车。他明白最好检查每一个可能的地方，寻找任何有用的东西，即使找到的可能性不大。

The store itself was pure white except for a thin blue strip that ran along the exterior of the building around the middle. The place had automated doors, but of course the power had been out. The exit door had been open though the first time Shinji had entered it, which made him wonder if somebody hadn't been leaving when...well when the disappeared. This was then only thing that made sense to him, even if everybody disappearing at once was unbelievable. But then again, so was everything that Asuka had told him.

商店本身是纯白色的，除了中间环绕建筑外部的一条细蓝带。这里有自动门，但当然电源已经断了。不过，真嗣第一次进入时，出口门是开着的，这让他怀疑是不是有人在……嗯，在消失的时候正要离开。这是唯一能让他理解的事情，即使所有人同时消失是难以置信的。但话说回来，明日香告诉他的所有事情也同样不可思议。

As he stepped into the department store he rubbed his arms as they were starting to chill. It was still earlier in the morning as Shinji had only left after he had made breakfast. Asuka was still sleeping before he had left, but he hoped she wouldn't be disgruntled by the cold oatmeal.

当他踏入百货商店时，他搓了搓手臂，因为它们开始感到寒冷。时间尚早，真嗣是在做完早餐后才离开的。明日香在他离开前还在熟睡，但他希望她不会因为冷掉的燕麦粥而生气。

He walked up and down the isles, passing the spot where he had gotten the sleeping bag and canned food. Eventually, he spied the clothing section at the back of the store and right beside it, the shoe section.

他在过道上来回踱步，经过了他买睡袋和罐头食品的地方。最终，他发现了商店后方的服装区，紧挨着的就是鞋区。

There wasn't much, as Shinji had suspected, but he walked up and down the isles looking at everything first. He was outside his element here, simple to say, and didn't have a clue what Asuka might actually like. He didn't relish the idea of being sent back only because she didn't like something he had chosen. Even so though, the store didn't have much in the way of clothes that he suspected she would like; the majority of the stuff was plain solid colors.

正如真嗣所料，这里的选择并不多，但他还是沿着过道来回走动，先看看所有的商品。简单来说，他对这里并不熟悉，完全不知道明日香可能会喜欢什么。他并不想因为选错了东西而被退回。尽管如此，商店里的衣服大多都是单调的纯色，他怀疑明日香不会喜欢。

While he was here though he decided that he may as well grab something for himself. This had nothing to do with what Asuka had told him yesterday he told himself. Finding a sweatshirt was at the forefront of his mind, and he did manage to find one. It was a little large for himself as he tried it on, but he couldn't really complain. He set this off to the side then as he looked through the rest of things.

尽管如此，他决定既然来了，不妨也为自己挑点什么。这与他昨天明日香告诉他的话无关，他告诉自己。他首先想到的是找一件运动衫，而且确实找到了一件。试穿时发现有点大，但他也没什么可抱怨的。他把这件放在一边，然后继续浏览其他商品。

Asuka had also asked for shoes, and since she hadn't told Shinji her shoe size, he had to guess this for the most part. He did decide to base it off his own size though, guessing that their feet couldn't be too different at their ages. He finally managed to settle on a pair of white running shoes. If she was going to continue this walking thing, then having running shoes would be best. He grabbed a package of socks as well that came with several, thinking that they could at least share these. His own socks where getting too worn out and each of them already had several holes.

明日香也要求了鞋子，由于她没有告诉真嗣她的鞋码，他大部分时间只能靠猜测。不过，他还是决定以自己的尺码为基准，猜测他们这个年龄段的脚大小应该不会相差太多。最终，他选定了一双白色的跑鞋。如果她打算继续这种步行方式，那么拥有一双跑鞋无疑是最佳选择。他还顺手拿了一包附带多双的袜子，心想至少这些他们可以共享。他自己的袜子已经磨损得厉害，每双都有好几个洞了。

Turning back to the clothes, he decided to just go with simplicity. He grabbed a pair of dark blue jeans that he hoped would fit her. Asuka was very slim from what he could tell, so they should fit. For a shirt, he grabbed a white t-shirt that had red stripes at the sleeves. Shinji rather guessed Asuka liked red; her current attire suggested it at least. And as for the sweatshirt, well, Shinji briefly thought about getting her the same white one he had grabbed himself, but he didn't think she'd like that. Eventually, he managed to find one that was solid red. It was close to the same size as his own, so it would probably be overlarge for her, but he supposed it could double as a pillow.

回头看向衣物，他决定选择简约风格。他抓起一条深蓝色牛仔裤，希望她能穿得上。从他的观察来看，明日香非常苗条，所以应该合适。至于上衣，他拿了一件白色 T 恤，袖子上有红色条纹。真嗣猜测明日香可能喜欢红色；至少她现在的装扮暗示了这一点。而说到运动衫，他短暂地考虑过给她拿自己拿的那件白色同款，但他觉得她不会喜欢。最终，他找到了一件纯红色的，尺寸与他自己的相近，对她来说可能会偏大，但他觉得可以当作枕头用。

Putting on the sweatshirt that he had chosen for himself, he slung the clothes over his shoulder and held the shoes with his hand. It felt weird to be walking out of the store with a bunch of clothes slung over his shoulder. The food and sleeping bag had been one thing, but not paying for all this stuff felt weird.

他穿上自己挑选的卫衣，将衣服搭在肩上，手里提着鞋子。肩上搭着一堆衣服走出商店的感觉很奇怪。食物和睡袋是一回事，但不付钱带走这些东西感觉很奇怪。

Walking back wasn't too difficult, and in what felt like a short time, Shinji was jogging down the hill that led to there makeshift camp.

走回去并不太难，感觉没过多久，真嗣就小跑着下了通往临时营地的小山。

Asuka was sitting up and eating the oatmeal that Shinji had left her and judging by her facial expressions, she wasn't enjoying the stone cold taste. This almost made Shinji laugh.

明日香正坐着吃真嗣留给她的燕麦粥，从她的面部表情判断，她并不喜欢这冰冷的口感。这几乎让真嗣笑出声来。

"Where did you go?" asked Asuka the minute Shinji walk up to her.

"你去哪儿了？" 真嗣一走近，明日香就问道。

"To get your clothes," said Shinji. He had forgotten how much he hated the idea when she had first asked him to do this, but in truth, it hadn't been that bad.

"去给你拿衣服，" 真嗣说。他曾忘记当初她第一次让他做这件事时，自己有多讨厌这个主意，但实际上，这并没有那么糟糕。

"Oh," mumbled Asuka as she looked at the clothes he had over his shoulder.

"哦，" 明日香咕哝着，目光落在他肩上搭着的衣服上。

'Still no word of thanks huh?' thought Shinji, but he wasn't really expecting anything.

“还是没听到一句感谢啊。”真嗣心想，但他其实也没指望什么。

"The oatmeal sucks by the way," grumbled Asuka as Shinji walked past her and grabbed a bottle of water, taking a sip of it.

“顺便说一句，那燕麦粥难吃死了，”明日香咕哝着，看着真嗣从她身边走过，拿起一瓶水喝了一口。

"Thats your fault for not waking up when I made it."

“那是你自己的错，谁叫你不早点起床。”

"You couldn't have just waited till I was up until you left?" Her voice was steadily beginning to rise.

“你就不能等到我起床再走吗？”她的声音逐渐升高。

"You're the one that asked me to. If you don't want them, I can just go take them back."

"是你让我拿的。如果你不想要，我可以直接拿回去。"

At this point, Asuka was looking daggers at him. Shinji didn't press his luck any further, but he thought her heard her hiss 'ass-hole' under her breath.

此时，明日香正用锐利的目光盯着他。真嗣没有再继续冒险，但他觉得他听到她低声咒骂了一句'混蛋'。

"Fine, give them here," said Asuka, her voice laced with venom still.

"好吧，把它们给我，"明日香说道，她的声音依然带着毒意。

Shinji dumped the clothes wordlessly into her outstretched arms and placed the shoes beside her. Asuka looked at them for a few moments before she said-

真嗣默默地将衣物扔进她伸出的双臂中，并将鞋子放在她旁边。明日香盯着它们看了片刻，然后说道——

"Well, it could have been worse I suppose," she said as she held up the t-shirt, her face rather passive. Shinji felt himself sigh with relief.

“嗯，我想情况可能更糟，”她一边说，一边举起 T 恤，脸上表情相当平静。这让真嗣松了一口气。

Turning around, he sat down on his own side of the fire just as Asuka said, "I see you picked yourself something as well." The anger in her voice had more or less disappeared by now.

他转过身，坐在火堆自己那一侧，正好听到明日香说：“看来你也给自己挑了点东西。”她声音中的怒气此时已消散了不少。

"A sweatshirt was something that I could use," said Shinji with a shrug.

“一件运动衫，我正好用得上。”真嗣耸耸肩说道。

Asuka looked as though she was itching to say something, but she kept her mouth closed. She continued looking at the clothes until she grimaced and said, "I want you to turn around."

明日香看起来很想说什么，但她紧闭着嘴。她继续盯着那些衣服，直到皱起眉头说：“我要你转过身去。”

If Shinji had been wise, he wouldn't have asked, but he hadn't thought what she implied.

如果真嗣足够明智，他本不会问出口，但他未曾细想她话中的深意。

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because I told you to dumb ass," said Asuka with as much control as she could muster.

“因为我告诉过你，笨蛋，”明日香竭力控制着自己的语气说道。

Shinji continued looking at her for several seconds, his eyes going from the clothes, to Asuka's face which was slightly pink-

真嗣继续盯着她看了几秒钟，目光从衣服移到明日香微微泛红的脸上

'Oh,' he thought suddenly, his own face turning slightly pink.

“哦，”他突然想到，自己的脸颊微微泛红。

"Right sorry," he said hurriedly as he shifted his entire body so that he was face the other way.

“抱歉，”他急忙说着，整个身体转了过去，面朝另一个方向。

"If you look this way, I'll take a piece of this burned wood and clobber you over the head with it."

“如果你往这边看，我就拿这块烧焦的木头敲你的头。”

'You'd have to catch me first,' thought Shinji rather angrily, but he didn't retort.

“你得先抓到我。”真嗣有些生气地想，但他没有回嘴。

Asuka continued staring at his back for several seconds before she grimaced and turned away from him as well; no way in hell would she trust him.

明日香继续盯着他的背影几秒钟，然后皱起眉头，同样转身离开了他；她绝不会信任他。

Getting the plug suit off took more time that she had anticipated, especially while sitting down. It was a full body suit of course, and even though her legs were working somewhat now, it was still difficult. She had been in that damn thing for so long that she almost forgot what her own body felt like as she placed a hand against her bare chest. The cold air beat against her body, and she enjoyed this for several seconds until she felt a chill shake her body.

脱下插入栓服比她预想的要花更多时间，尤其是坐着的时候。这当然是一件全身套装，尽管她的腿现在有些知觉了，但仍然很困难。她在那该死的东西里待了太久，以至于几乎忘记了赤裸胸膛的感觉，当她把手放在胸前时。冷空气拍打在她的身体上，她享受了几秒钟，直到一阵寒意让她颤抖。

'Probably best to dress before I get sick again,' thought Asuka.

“最好在再次生病前穿上衣服，”明日香心想。

She first pulled the t-shirt over her body and padded it down looking at her chest. It wasn't tight, but she was still worried about a certain problem. The sweatshirt would fix that probably though. The jeans were almost her exact waist size, and she was admittedly surprised and creeped out at the same time that Shinji had got it right. As she pulled the sweatshirt over her head though, she let out a sigh, enjoying the warmth that it guaranteed. The plug suit was fine, but actually wearing cotton clothes always felt nicer. And the sweatshirt did a good job in keeping her warm.

她首先将 T 恤套在身上，整理了一下，看着自己的胸部。虽然不算紧绷，但她仍对某个问题感到担忧。不过，套头衫或许能解决这个问题。牛仔裤的腰围几乎与她的完全吻合，她不禁既惊讶又觉得有些毛骨悚然，因为真嗣竟然猜对了尺寸。当她将套头衫套在头上时，她叹了口气，享受着它带来的温暖。插入栓服虽然不错，但穿上棉质衣物总是感觉更舒适。而且，套头衫确实很好地保暖了。

She looked down at herself then. It may not have been the clothes she would have chosen, but it wasn't terrible either.

她低头看了看自己。虽然这些衣服不是她会自己选择的，但也不算糟糕。

She turned around then, and saw that Shinji was still looking away from her.

她转过身，看到真嗣仍然背对着她。

'Well he's either a coward or honest to a fault,' thought Asuka snidely.

“哼，他要么是个懦夫，要么就是诚实得过分。”明日香尖刻地想道。

"You can turn around now," said Asuka.

"你现在可以转过身来了," 明日香说道。

Shinji did so, though very slowly as though he couldn't trust Asuka's own words. As he did so, he saw that she had pulled on her socks, but was having trouble getting the shoes on.

真嗣照做了，尽管动作非常缓慢，仿佛无法相信明日香的话。当他转身时，他看到她已经穿上了袜子，但正在费力地穿鞋。

"Are they too small?" asked Shinji quietly as he watched her struggle.

"是不是太小了？" 真嗣轻声问道，看着她挣扎的样子。

"Too big," said Asuka, "but that shouldn't be a problem. My...feet...won't..."

"太大了，" 明日香说，"但这应该不是问题。我的...脚...不会..."

Shinji watched her struggle for several more seconds before he sighed and stood up, walking over to her.

真嗣又看了她挣扎了几秒钟，然后叹了口气站起来，走过去帮她。

"What?" asked Asuka bluntly as Shinji sat down next to her.

“什么？”明日香直截了当地问，此时真嗣在她旁边坐下。

"Give them here," he said.

“把它们给我。”他说。

"You're not dressing me," she said stubbornly.

"你别想给我穿衣服，"她固执地说。

"There just shoes," he replied.

"只是鞋子而已，"他回答道。

"I don't care," said Asuka as she shook her head. She was obviously troubled that she couldn't even do this.

"我不在乎，"明日香摇着头说。她显然因为连这点小事都做不到而感到困扰。

She did relent eventually, and Shinji took the shoe and examined it for a brief second before her took Asuka's foot, and gently slid it into the shoe. Shinji could feel her steadily growing angrier next to him as he laced them up as well. Something she had such difficult with, he had done in a second.

她最终还是让步了，真嗣接过鞋子，短暂地检查了一下，然后握住明日香的一只脚，轻轻地将其滑入鞋中。真嗣能感觉到她在他身边越来越生气，因为他还迅速地系好了鞋带。这件事她一直很难做到，他却一瞬间就完成了。

"Next," said Shinji. “下一个，”真嗣说道。

Asuka raised her other foot, but Shinji had a feeling she would have rather planted it in his face.

明日香抬起了另一只脚，但真嗣有种感觉，她更愿意将它踩在他的脸上。

He laced the other one up without much difficulty either, and then he helped her stand up so she could get a feel. She was wobbly at first, but got her balance and quickly walked slowly around, testing out the feel of the shoes.

他同样没费多大劲就系好了另一只鞋，然后帮她站起来，让她感受一下。起初她有些摇晃，但很快就找到了平衡，慢慢地绕着圈子走，试探着鞋子的感觉。

"How is it?" asked Shinji as he walked beside to her.

“感觉怎么样？”真嗣陪在她身边问道。

"A lot different than walking in the plug suit."

“和穿着插入栓服走路大不一样。”

This somewhat surprised Shinji.

这让真嗣有些意外。

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"The plug suit is a full body suit first off...so theres that, and the shoes feel much closer to just wearing socks than actual shoes. Its a little...awkward at first I guess."

“首先，插入栓服是全身套装...所以有那个感觉，而且鞋子穿起来更像是只穿了袜子而不是真正的鞋子。一开始有点...尴尬吧。”

"Well...you got it quickly." said Shinji.

"嗯...你学得挺快的。" 真嗣说道。

"Of course I did," said Asuka as she glanced at him.

"当然啦，" 明日香瞥了他一眼说道。

They walked a few times around the fire until Asuka got tired and sat back down. After that, Shinji started making dinner.

他们围着篝火走了几圈，直到明日香累了坐回地上。之后，真嗣开始准备晚餐。

After finishing, they both laid down on there respective sides of the sleeping bag and were silent for a while until Shinji broached something that he had been thinking about since yesterday.

完事后，两人各自躺在睡袋的一侧，沉默了一会儿，直到真嗣提起昨天以来一直在思考的事情。

"Asuka...yesterday you said that you had grown sick of Tokyo-3. I have too, but honestly, where else would we go?"

“明日香……昨天你说对第三新东京市感到厌倦了。我也是，但说实话，我们还能去哪儿呢？”

"How should I know." "我怎么知道。"

"You don't have anywhere else you want to go?"

"你没有其他想去的地方吗？"

"Not that I could think off...I'm just not sure. Why do you?"

"我想不出来...我只是不确定。你呢？"

"Maybe...the other side of the valley...where I was before."

"或许...山谷的另一边...我之前所在的地方。"

Asuka knew what he meant, but didn't want to think about that. She didn't want to think about those times.

明日香明白他的意思，但她不想去想那些事。她不想回忆那些时光。

"I don't want to talk about that right now," said Asuka as she turned away from him, away from the fire. Though as she did this, something caught Shinji's eye. He thought it was just her hair, but he noticed those things she had clipped to her hair. She had told him about them before, but he couldn't remember what they were called.

"我现在不想谈这个，"明日香说着，转身背对着他，也背对着火堆。然而就在这时，有什么东西引起了真嗣的注意。他原以为是她的头发，但随后注意到她发间夹着的那些小饰品。她之前跟他提过，但他记不清它们叫什么了。

"How come you're still wearing those things?" Shinji asked without much delicacy.

“你怎么还穿着那些东西？”真嗣不太客气地问道。

"What things?" asked Asuka tonelessly.

“什么事？”明日香无动于衷地问。

"Those things in your hair."

“你头发里的那些东西。”

Asuka turned back towards and stared wordlessly at him for a few seconds.

明日香转过身来，默默地盯着他几秒钟。

"I thought that you would have taken them off when you changed out of the plug suit. You said you were sick of it before so-"

“我以为你换下插入栓服的时候会脱掉它们。你之前不是说厌倦了吗——”

"These remind me of who I am," said Asuka as she cut him off.

“这些让我记得我是谁，”明日香打断了他。

"Who you are?" asked Shinji confused.

"你是谁？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

Asuka didn't reply but sat up, letting the sleeping bag slide off of her. She had removed the sweatshirt and was using it as a pillow now.

明日香没有回答，只是坐起身来，让睡袋从她身上滑落。她已经脱掉了运动衫，现在正用它当枕头。

"I'm an Evangelion pilot, the Second Child, and part of Nerv whose duty it is to defeat the angels."

"我是福音战士驾驶员，第二适格者，隶属于 NERV，职责是击败使徒。"

"Isn't that in the past now though?"

"那不是已经成为过去了吗？"

"I suppose it is," said Asuka. "But these things..." she mumbled as she placed a hand over the A-10 nerve receptors, "they made who I am."

"我想是的，" 明日香说道，"但这些……" 她喃喃自语，将手放在 A-10 神经感受器上，"它们塑造了现在的我。"

Shinji couldn't understand this however. So then...what was Asuka before she became an Evangelion pilot?

真嗣无法理解这一点。那么……在成为 EVA 驾驶员之前，明日香又是谁呢？

"Are you that attached to them?"

"你真的那么依赖它们吗？"

"Is that so wrong?" snapped Asuka.

“这样有错吗？”明日香厉声反问。

"I don't think its wrong," said Shinji as he shook his head. 'But it makes you sound like you don't have a purpose anymore,' he thought silently.

“我不觉得有错，”真嗣摇头说道，‘但那会让你听起来好像失去了存在的意义，’他默默地想。

Asuka watched him; she seemed unsure of herself. Or maybe she was unsure about leaving Tokyo-3. Maybe she was afraid that if she left, everything that she had existed to do would have been for naught. She had been an Evangelion pilot, but not once had she ever fought the angels. Wasn't that just a waste of an existence? A waste of her time in college? What had she been doing all this time then?

明日香注视着他，显得有些犹豫不决。或许她对离开第三新东京市心存疑虑。也许她害怕一旦离开，她为之存在的一切都将化为泡影。她曾是 EVA 驾驶员，却从未与使徒战斗过。这样的存在岂不是一种浪费？她在大学里的时光岂不是白费？那她这段时间究竟在做什么呢？

"Go to sleep Shinji," Asuka said.

“去睡吧，真嗣，”明日香说道。

While Asuka found this easy to do, Shinji had more difficulty as he lay awake thinking about Asuka. She was still unwillingly to open up about herself, and Shinji had a feeling there were several reasons for that. If being an Evangelion pilot had meant everything to her, he could understand why she didn't want to throw those things away. It was a relic of who she was, what she had been. At the same time, it was sad to see her depressed like that.

虽然明日香觉得这很容易做到，但真嗣却难以入眠，他躺在床上想着明日香。她仍然不愿意敞开心扉，真嗣感觉这其中有许多原因。如果成为 EVA 驾驶员对她意味着一切，他可以理解她为何不愿放弃这些。这是她身份的遗迹，是她曾经的样子。与此同时，看到她那样沮丧也令人难过。

During there time together, Shinji had grown used to Asuka to the extent that he could say he wasn't bothered by her company anymore. He could even go so far as to say they were friends, though he wasn't sure if thats how Asuka viewed him as well.

在他们相处的这段时间里，真嗣已经习惯了明日香，甚至可以说他不再介意她的陪伴。他甚至可以大胆地说他们是朋友，尽管他不确定明日香是否也这样看待他。

He had a feeling though, that her guard might have been cracked slightly. She seemed unsure about what she wanted to do. Now that she could walk, she wasn't as helpless, nor tying them down to the beach anymore. But Shinji could also tell that she didn't want to leave Tokyo-3, even though she said what she said. She was waring with herself internally.

他有种感觉，她的防线可能已经稍稍松动了。她似乎不确定自己想要做什么。现在她能走路了，不再那么无助，也不再拖累他们在海滩上了。但真嗣也能看出，她并不想离开第三新东京市，尽管她说了那样的话。她在内心挣扎着。

Shinji could wait certainly, but for how long? When would she be ready? He didn't want to push her. The last thing he needed was the Asuka that he had first met on the beach who had tried to kill him.

真嗣当然可以等待，但能等多久呢？她什么时候才会准备好？他不想逼她。他最不需要的就是在海滩上第一次遇到的那个试图杀死他的明日香。

Even so, staying here forever wasn't going to do anything.

即便如此，永远留在这里也解决不了任何问题。

Shinji rolled over onto his side and faced the fire, staring across it to Asuka.

真嗣侧身躺下，面向火堆，凝视着对面的明日香。

What did he want as well? There were still many things that Shinji didn't know that asking that question of himself just seemed plain stupid.

他到底还想要什么呢？真嗣仍有许多未知，以至于向自己提出这个问题显得相当愚蠢。

He rolled back onto his back and closed his eyes, trying to fall asleep, forgetting about what Asuka had told him about earlier. Whenever she was ready to talk, Shinji would be there to listen.

他翻身仰躺，闭上眼睛，试图入睡，忘记了明日香之前告诉他的事情。无论何时她准备好倾诉，真嗣都会在那里聆听。

As he thought this, he slowly fell asleep, while above him, the clouds above Tokyo-3 started to darken.

正当他这么想着，他渐渐进入了梦乡，而头顶上，东京-3 上空的云层开始变得阴沉。

### Chapter 6: Remembrance

Right so I'm really drunk right now so ignore any typing problems right now. This chapter is...well something that had to happen sooner or later I guess, and the sooner the better. Getting it out the of the way, Shinji and Asuka can continue there lives as so at least. Trying to do one chapter a month at least as well.

好吧，我现在真的醉了，所以忽略任何打字问题。这个chapter是……嗯，我想迟早得发生的事，越早越好。把它解决了，真嗣和明日香才能继续他们的生活。至少试着每个月写一篇chapter。

On another note, no idea whether I'll do a one shot for Valentines Day. Probably not in all likely hood, but on my birthday (March 10th), maybe we'll see something. I'm thinking birthday themed I guess, go figure, as I haven't done something like that before.

另外，不知道会不会为情人节写一篇短篇。很可能不会，但我的生日（3 月 10 日）可能会写点什么。我想可能是生日主题的，毕竟我以前没写过类似的东西。

It was the rain that started first.

首先是雨开始了。

Looking back on the previous week, Shinji was surprised at how lucky they had been. No more it seemed.

回顾上一周，真嗣惊讶于他们的幸运程度。看来不会再有了。

A storm was passing overhead, the winds billowing and screeching so loudly that Shinji thought God himself was screaming at them. The waves roared against the shore, and blew the spray from the water towards them. Not that the rain wasn't already doing that.

一场风暴正从头顶经过，狂风呼啸，尖叫声之大，真嗣以为上帝本人在向他们咆哮。海浪咆哮着冲击海岸，将水花吹向他们。不过，雨水已经在做同样的事了。

Shinji awoke quickly at the start of this, and immediately went to the fire which had died down during the night. It was nigh on impossible to get it started again though with the wet wood and Shinji found himself giving up quickly.

真嗣在这开始时迅速醒来，立刻走向那夜幕中已熄灭的篝火。然而，湿木头使得重新点燃它几乎不可能，真嗣很快便放弃了尝试。

The wind continued roaring as Shinji made his way back to his sleeping bag which had been blown several feet away. He gathered it up, cursing the wind and rain as he walked, and grabbed the sweatshirt he had gotten. Throwing it over his head, he made his way back to the dead fire. It was at this point that Asuka decided to voice her opinion.

风继续咆哮着，真嗣回到被吹出几英尺远的睡袋旁。他收拾好睡袋，一边咒骂着风和雨，一边拿起他得到的运动衫。他套上运动衫，再次走向那熄灭的篝火。就在这时，明日香决定表达她的看法。

"What the fuck is going on?"

“搞什么鬼？”

Her voice came over the wind as though it was a whisper, and Shinji could barely hear her. He could only guess at how pissed she was though.

她的声音随风飘来，仿佛耳语一般，真嗣几乎听不清。他只能猜测她有多生气。

The storm raged on through most of the night and the wind continued to howl, making conversation all but impossible unless they were right next to each other. Shinji didn't bother testing this though, as he assumed Asuka was in no mood. He wasn't very happy himself.

风暴肆虐了大半个夜晚，风继续咆哮着，使得交谈几乎不可能，除非他们紧挨着彼此。真嗣没有尝试这样做，因为他猜想明日香心情不佳。他自己也不太高兴。

Wet and tired was how they spent much of that night, and only when morning came did the rain relent, but the wind continued to beat against the beach. Thankful for this much though, they both were able to get a few extra hours of sleep until Shinji woke up.

那个夜晚，他们大多时候都湿漉漉又疲惫不堪，直到早晨雨势才有所减弱，但风依旧拍打着海滩。尽管如此，他们还是感激地多睡了几个小时，直到真嗣醒来。

He didn't have much hope in getting a fire started, and only tried halfheartedly, until he gave up, and they had to dine on uncooked oatmeal, which was little different than slop. Though she didn't speak, Shinji heard Asuka grumbling under her breath about the sudden shift in living conditions.

他对生火没抱太大希望，只是敷衍地试了试，最后还是放弃了，他们只能吃着未煮的燕麦，这跟猪食也没多大差别。尽管她没说话，但真嗣听到了明日香低声抱怨生活条件的突然变化。

They had been lucky to have the weather on there side for a while, but it seemed that there luck had run out. Shinji in particular was worried that the cold and rain might send Asuka spiraling back into a condition he didn't want to see her in. That and her legs would certainly start to seize up again.

他们曾一度幸运地拥有好天气，但似乎这份好运已经耗尽。特别是真嗣，他担心寒冷和雨水可能会让明日香再次陷入他不愿见到的状态。此外，她的双腿肯定也会再次抽筋。

So, because of those thoughts, he spent most of that morning searching for anything that he could use to get a fire started, going so far as to break into a car where he saw several magazines on the floor. Without anything to keep the fire going though, the paper wouldn't last very long. Then again, even if he did manage to get the fire going, it would be blown out by the wind almost certainly. The clouds above Tokyo-3 still hadn't left, and Shinji was only waiting to feel droplets of rain on his face again.

因此，出于这些考虑，那天早上他大部分时间都在寻找任何可以用来生火的东西，甚至不惜闯入一辆车里，因为他看到地板上有几本杂志。然而，没有东西维持火势，纸张不会持续太久。再者，即使他设法点燃了火，也很可能会被风吹灭。东京-3 上空的云层仍未散去，真嗣只是在等待再次感受到脸上的雨滴。

As the morning disappeared though, the rain started to slowly return, and all too quickly, the magazines that Shinji had painstakingly found were soaked through. Asuka was in no mood for this sudden realization that they would be without fire again, and found it proper to berate Shinji because of this. They both argued back and forth over the dead fire as the rain came down around them.

然而，随着早晨的消逝，雨又开始慢慢回来，而且快得让人措手不及，真嗣费尽心思找到的杂志全都被浸透了。明日香对此突如其来的现实——他们又将没有火——毫无心情，觉得有必要因此责骂真嗣。他们围绕着熄灭的火堆争论不休，雨水在他们周围落下。

Dinner was even more lackluster than breakfast, and halfway through, Asuka threw the entire contents of the pot across the beach from where she sat, and started cursing wildly. Shinji would have liked to say a few things himself, even if they would have been directed at Asuka. However, he silently grabbed the pot that she had flung and brought it back to the camp.

晚餐比早餐还要乏味，吃到一半，明日香就把整锅食物从她坐的地方扔到了海滩上，开始疯狂咒骂。真嗣本想说几句，哪怕是对着明日香。然而，他默默地捡起她扔掉的锅，带回了营地。

They both lay in there sleeping bags miserable again that night and the rain poured down around them. Shinji's sleeping bag was so wet to the point that with or without it wouldn't have made much of a difference. Asuka on the other hand had completely zipped her sleeping bag up so that not even her head was poking out. Shinji didn't think that was helping much though, and sure enough, Asuka's poked out as she gasped for fresh air.

那晚，他们俩又躺在睡袋里，心情沮丧，雨水倾盆而下。真嗣的睡袋湿透了，无论是否使用，都没什么区别。而明日香则完全拉上了睡袋的拉链，连头都没露出来。真嗣觉得这没什么用，果然，明日香的头探了出来，她喘着气寻求新鲜空气。

"When the fuck is this ever going to let up?" yelled Asuka, more to the sky than at Shinji.

“这他妈到底什么时候才能消停？”明日香对着天空吼道，与其说是在对真嗣说，不如说更像是在对天发泄。

'Not anytime soon from the look of things,' thought Shinji, but he had other problems he was worried about.

'看样子不会很快好转，' 真嗣心想，但他还有其他担忧的问题。

"How is your leg?" he asked.

"你的腿怎么样了？" 他问道。

"How the fuck do you think it is?" shouted Asuka. "It's freezing."

"你觉得呢？" 明日香吼道，"冷得要命。"

'Not good,' thought Shinji. 'If this cold doesn't relent soon...'

“情况不妙，”真嗣心想，“如果这股寒流还不减弱……”

Shinji left his thought hanging, not willing to think where it might lead. But surely the storm couldn't continue on like this.

真嗣没有继续想下去，不愿去想可能导致的后果。但这场风暴肯定不会一直这样持续下去。

He was maybe partially right.

他或许部分说对了。

At some point past midnight, they both managed to fall asleep, but that was when the first bout of thunder started. It woke them up so suddenly that Shinji at first thought that his ear drums had ruptured. He stood up, and very nearly fell over as a gust of wind struck him, almost knocking him backwards. The thunder roared again, almost sounding as though giants were fighting in the city.

午夜过后某个时刻，他们俩终于设法入睡了，但就在这时第一阵雷声开始了。雷声如此突然地将他们惊醒，以至于真嗣起初以为自己的耳膜破裂了。他站起身来，几乎被一阵狂风击倒，差点被吹得向后倒去。雷声再次轰鸣，听起来几乎像是巨人在城市中战斗。

Shinji didn't see any other choice then what the one he had thought of earlier. He had no idea how long the storm would last, and waiting it out could be a problem, and Asuka may not make it through another night.

真嗣那时没有其他选择，只能采取他之前想到的办法。他不知道这场风暴会持续多久，等待它过去可能是个问题，而明日香可能撑不过另一个夜晚。

Throwing the sweatshirt over his already soaked shirt, he battled his way towards Asuka, feeling as though he was fighting against a giant hand that was pressing against him.

他将运动衫套在已经湿透的衬衫上，艰难地向明日香走去，感觉自己仿佛在与一只巨大的手掌对抗，那手掌正压迫着他。

"Asuka! Get up! Now!" "明日香！起来！马上！"

Shinji could barely hear his own voice as the thunder sounded again, but he didn't think Asuka couldn't have heard him. Even so, she didn't make any move to get up.

真嗣几乎听不清自己的声音，因为雷声再次响起，但他不认为明日香会听不见。即便如此，她也没有任何起身的动作。

"Asuka! We have to get out of the storm for a while! C'mon!"

"明日香！我们得暂时离开这场暴风雨！快点！"

Shinji shouted again, this time with more force in his voice. Asuka still didn't move, and Shinji was starting to grow worried. The thunder exploded again, and a flash of lightning streaked across the sky, lighting up the entire world for a brief instance.

真嗣再次大喊，这次他的声音中带着更多的力量。明日香仍然一动不动，真嗣开始感到担忧。雷声再次炸响，一道闪电划过天空，短暂地照亮了整个世界。

Getting down on his knees, Shinji forcefully unzipped the sleeping bag and was surprised to see Asuka curled up under it with her eyes tightly shut. This scared him even more for some reason.

真嗣跪下身来，用力拉开睡袋的拉链，惊讶地发现明日香蜷缩在里面，双眼紧闭。不知为何，这让他更加害怕。

"Asuka, we have to move!"

"明日香，我们得动身了！"

She still didn't reply, or even shake her head. She didn't give any sign of moving, but she seemed to be trembling slightly. What the hell was wrong with her?

她依旧没有回应，甚至没有摇头。她没有任何移动的迹象，但似乎在微微颤抖。她到底怎么了？

"Asuka, move!" yelled Shinji, almost directly next to her face.

"明日香，快动！" 真嗣几乎是对着她的脸大喊道。

"No," she finally whispered through half closed lips.

“不，”她终于半闭着嘴唇低声说道。

This was too much for Shinji. After hearing her praise herself constantly when she herself had done absolutely nothing, Shinji was fed up with her attitude. Forcefully grabbing her arm from inside the sleeping bag, he pulled her out of. Her body was cold to the touch and limp. Was the cold sapping her strength?

这对真嗣来说太过分了。听到她不停地自夸，而她自己却什么也没做，真嗣对她这种态度感到厌烦。他强行从睡袋里抓住她的手臂，将她拉了出来。她的身体触感冰冷且无力。是寒冷在消耗她的力量吗？

He stood her upright, angry at how stubborn she was being. This was completely different from before. If she didn't move, then Shinji would drag her to shelter if he had to. He was not leaving her again.

他让她站直，对她的固执感到恼火。这与之前完全不同。如果她不动，那么必要时真嗣会拖着她去避难。他不会再丢下她了。

"Asuka, we have move. This storm won't be subsiding soon. We need to find shelter."

"明日香，我们得转移了。这场风暴不会很快减弱。我们需要找个避难所。"

"No," she whispered again.

“不，”她再次低声说道。

Shinji was so pissed at her that he almost hit her, though he restrained himself. Couldn't she understand that he was scared for her sake?

真嗣对她气得几乎要动手，尽管他还是克制住了自己。难道她就不能理解他是为了她而感到害怕吗？

"Asuka...listen to me," tried Shinji calmly. "The way this weather is...your leg wont be getting better. It will be getting worse." Shinji felt like he was talking to a child.

"Asuka...听我说，" 真嗣平静地尝试着，"这样的天气...你的腿不会好转的。情况只会越来越糟。" 真嗣感觉自己像是在跟一个孩子说话。

"So we have to get out of here," he finished.

"所以我们必须离开这里，"他总结道。

"No," she said again. "不，"她再次说道。

Shinji angrily grabbed her shoulders then, and shook her none to gently.

真嗣愤怒地抓住她的肩膀，用力摇晃着她。

"Asuka!" he yelled at her. "We have to fucking move!"

"明日香！" 他朝她吼道，"我们他妈的得动起来！"

"NO!" she screamed back at him, yanking away from his grasp. She turned around quickly, and before Shinji could do anything, she took several steps away from him, and then fell backwards onto her sleeping bag and pulled it around herself.

"不！" 她尖叫着回应他，猛地挣脱他的手。她迅速转身，还没等真嗣反应过来，她就快步远离他，然后向后倒在自己的睡袋上，拉过睡袋裹住自己。

Shinji stared back at her, awestruck. What the hell had happened to her?

真嗣目瞪口呆地看着她。她到底怎么了？

That was when he got a look at her face. Asuka was soaked just as he was. Her hair hung in great lumps around her face, shielding it mostly from view, but as Shinji looked closely, he noticed water streaking down her face that he didn't think was from the rain.

就在那时，他看清了她的脸。明日香和他一样浑身湿透，头发成团地贴在脸上，大部分面容被遮挡，但当真嗣仔细观察时，他注意到她脸上流淌的水迹，他觉得那不像是雨水。

Was Asuka crying? 明日香在哭吗？

This surprised Shinji so much that he didn't even flinch when the thunder rolled overhead again.

这令真嗣如此惊讶，以至于当头顶再次响起雷声时，他甚至没有退缩。

Asuka was crying. 明日香在哭泣。

Was it because of the rain from before, when she was sick? Or was it something else?

是因为之前生病时的那场雨吗？还是其他什么原因？

Shinji didn't know what to do. What could he do? Asuka never cried, Shinji knew that just from watching how she acted. So why was it that she was crying now? Was it the thunder that scared her? It scared him too, but crying over it was...unlike Asuka as he knew her.

真嗣不知道该怎么办。他能做什么呢？明日香从不哭泣，真嗣仅从她的行为就能看出这一点。那么为什么她现在在哭呢？是因为雷声吓到她了吗？雷声也吓到了他，但为此哭泣……不像他所认识的明日香。

Something else...it had to have been.

一定有别的原因……

'...A dream?' thought Shinji suddenly. If she had been dreaming, and it wasn't a very pleasant dream, and then the thunder...

'……一个梦？'真嗣突然想到。如果她做了梦，而且不是一个愉快的梦，再加上雷声……

"Is that it? Were you dreaming?" Shinji asked Asuka as he looked down at her. She didn't give any recognition to this.

“就这些吗？你在做梦吗？”真嗣低头看着明日香问道。她对此没有任何反应。

Shinji felt bad for his rudeness to her earlier now.

真嗣现在为自己之前的粗鲁感到内疚。

Kneeling down in front of her, Shinji looked past the tangle of hair surrounding her face to her eyes. There were droplets of water at the corners of them, and this solidified his thought.

真嗣跪在她面前，透过她脸上凌乱的发丝看向她的眼睛。眼角挂着水珠，这让他更加确信。

"Asuka..." Shinji began, but she very abruptly shook her head and mumbled-

"明日香..." 真嗣开口道，但她非常突然地摇了摇头，咕哝着——

"Leave me alone." "别管我。"

'Remember what happened the last time I left you alone?' thought Shinji. He wasn't about to repeat the same mistakes.

‘记得上次我把你一个人留下时发生了什么吗？’ 真嗣心想。他不会再重蹈覆辙了。

"I'm not going to leave you alone," said Shinji quietly.

“我不会让你一个人了，” 真嗣平静地说。

Asuka looked back at him then, anger clear on her stricken face. She was torn in two right now. Her hatred over seeming helpless and whatever had scared her so was ripping her apart. And Shinji was viewing it all. She hated it.

明日香回头看着他，脸上明显带着愤怒。她此刻内心矛盾重重。她对无助感的憎恨以及那让她如此恐惧的东西正在将她撕裂。而真嗣正目睹这一切。她对此深恶痛绝。

"Not like before," Shinji said.

“不像以前那样了。” 真嗣说道。

"Because you can't live with the guilt?" asked Asuka mocking him, though she was choking on the words.

"因为你无法承受那份愧疚？" 明日香嘲讽地问他，尽管她的话语中带着哽咽。

"If I abandoned you again, what would that make me? The lowest person ever? If I felt guilty for letting a friend die while I did nothing to prevent it, then fine, call it guilt. I haven't had many people I've been able to call friends in the first place, or people I've even been able to talk to"

"如果我再次抛弃你，那我算什么？史上最卑鄙的人吗？如果我对眼睁睁看着朋友死去却无所作为感到内疚，那就随你叫它内疚吧。我本来就没有多少可以称之为朋友的人，甚至连能交谈的人都不多。"

Asuka hesitated as he spoke the word friend. They were simply in this pile of shit together. Friendship was something else.

当他说出“朋友”这个词时，明日香犹豫了。他们只是共同陷入了这堆烂摊子。友谊是另一回事。

"Friends are..." started Asuka.

"朋友是..." 明日香开口道。

"Whether you think of me that way as well, thats your decision. Sure, things suck. We never seem to be able to agree on any one damn thing, but I'm not gonna say that I dislike being around you Asuka."

"无论你是否也那样看待我，那是你的决定。当然，事情很糟糕。我们似乎永远无法就任何一件事达成一致，但我不会说我不喜欢和你在一起，明日香。"

This caught Asuka off guard, and she momentarily forgot about her dream.

这让明日香措手不及，她暂时忘记了她的梦。

"We don't have any choice but to take shelter until this thing blows over. So we need to start moving."

"我们别无选择，只能找个地方避一避，直到这阵风波过去。所以我们需要开始行动了。"

Asuka watched him from behind her tangle of hair. Her eyes felt incredibly bloodshot and she was tired from lack of sleep. But she pushed everything to the back of her mind and stood up slowly. Her head hurt, the thunder was giving her a headache, and images kept on flashing in her mind, things she had kept buried. But that was then, and this was now.

明日香透过她纠结的发丝注视着他。她的眼睛红得厉害，因缺乏睡眠而疲惫不堪。但她将一切思绪推至脑海深处，缓缓站起身来。她的头很痛，雷声让她头疼欲裂，那些被她深埋的记忆不断在脑海中闪现。但那是过去，而现在已是现在。

She didn't say anything, and continued to avert her gaze from Shinji, but he was looking directly at her. On a normal day, she would have probably hit him by now.

她没有说话，继续避开真嗣的目光，但他却直直地看着她。换作平常日子，她可能早就揍他了。

The thunder boomed again, and they both flinched, aware again of the situation they were in.

雷声再次轰鸣，两人都吓了一跳，再次意识到他们所处的境况。

"We need to get moving," said Shinji.

"我们得动身了，" 真嗣说道。

"Right," said Asuka quietly, still not looking at him. Though as she took one step forward, pain seared in her right ankle, and she stumbled forward, only to be caught by Shinji. His face was laced with fear.

"好的，" 明日香轻声回应，依旧没有看向他。然而，当她向前迈出一步时，右脚踝的剧痛突然袭来，她踉跄向前，被真嗣及时扶住。他的脸上满是担忧。

"What is it? Your leg?"

"怎么了？是腿吗？"

"Its my ankle...I think I twisted something when I fell backwards," said Asuka, feeling even more helpless and now incredibly stupid. Why had she reacted so badly to the dream and thunder? Thunder had never particularly scared her, or maybe it was the fear of death she was feeling again.

“是我的脚踝……我想我摔倒时扭到了什么，”明日香说道，感到更加无助，现在还觉得自己愚蠢至极。为什么她会对那个梦和雷声反应如此糟糕？雷声从未特别吓到过她，或许是因为她再次感受到了对死亡的恐惧。

Shinji looked at her for several seconds, before her turned around and bent down saying, "nothing we can do about it. I'll have to carry you then."

真嗣看了她几秒钟，然后转过身弯下腰说：“没办法了。那我只好背你了。”

"What!?" she replied, "I'd rather walk with this bad ankle then-"

“什么！？”她回答，“我宁愿瘸着脚走——”

"Asuka...for once, please just shut up and do this. I'm not gonna have you fall over backwards if you try to climb that hill."

“明日香...就这一次，请闭上嘴照做吧。我可不想你试着爬那座山时摔个四脚朝天。”

"And if you fall backwards while carrying me?" she snapped back at him, regaining some of her flare.

"如果背着我的时候你摔倒了怎么办？" 她厉声回敬，恢复了几分往日的风采。

"Then I'll be sure to fall face first," said Shinji without a hitch in his voice. "Now hurry up."

"那我一定会脸先着地，" 真嗣毫不犹豫地说道，"现在快点吧。"

Asuka stood silently as she watched Shinji bend down with his arms held out behind him. Anything, anything else would have been better then having to degrade herself by letting Shinji carry her. She would have almost rather have stayed here.

明日香静静地站着，看着真嗣弯下腰，双臂向后伸出。任何事情，任何其他选择都比让她屈尊让真嗣背要好。她几乎宁愿留在这里。

Slowly though, she started walking towards him until she was standing directly behind him. Placing a hand wordlessly on his shoulders, she held it there for several seconds until she brought the other hand up, and together, wrapped them both around Shinji's neck. Wordlessly, he then grabbed both her legs and lifted her slowly off the ground, forcing Asuka's chest against his back. Shinji was aware of this, but let it slip his mind. There was certainly something there, even if it was relatively small. Asuka wrapped her arms tighter around Shinji, clinging on as if she was a child. She felt embarrassed but supposed the worst was over. And Shinji's words about enjoying being around her was still ringing in her ears.

然而，她开始缓缓地向他走去，直到站在他正后方。她无声地将一只手搭在他的肩上，停留了几秒钟，然后抬起另一只手，双臂一同环抱住真嗣的脖子。他则默默地抓住她的双腿，慢慢地将她举离地面，迫使明日香的胸脯紧贴在他的背上。真嗣对此有所察觉，却未放在心上。那里确实有些许触感，尽管相对较小。明日香更紧地环抱住真嗣，仿佛一个孩子般紧紧依附。她感到羞涩，但心想最糟糕的时刻已经过去。而真嗣关于喜欢和她在一起的话语，仍在她耳边回响。

"Ready?" he asked. “准备好了吗？”他问道。

"Yeah," said Asuka with a low sigh. Whether this was in annoyance or something else, Shinji didn't ask.

"嗯，"明日香低声叹息道。这声叹息是出于恼怒还是别的什么，真嗣没有追问。

They mounted the hill eventually with a small bit of difficulty. Shinji at one point lost his footing and almost did think he was going to fall backwards, just as Asuka had warned him about. The hillside had grown slippery with the downpour of rain making walking less than easy. That and with Asuka on his back, his balance was thrown off. As they had slipped, her grip around his neck tightened suddenly, cutting off his oxygen briefly, but he managed to right himself. The last thing he needed was to injure himself as well.

他们最终还是费了些周折才登上山丘。有一刻，真嗣失足差点向后摔倒，正如明日香之前警告过的那样。倾盆大雨使得山坡变得湿滑，行走变得不那么轻松。再加上明日香在他背上，他的平衡感被打破了。当他们滑倒时，她环在他脖子上的手臂突然收紧，短暂地切断了他的呼吸，但他设法稳住了自己。他最不需要的就是也让自己受伤。

Shinji didn't put much thought into where to take shelter, and headed towards the closest building in front of him. It wasn't the most glamorous building ever, but it did have a roof, and that meant the world to Shinji right now.

真嗣并没有多想该去哪里避难，只是朝着眼前最近的建筑物走去。那并非最华丽的建筑，但它有屋顶，对现在的真嗣来说，这就足够了。

Walking over broken glass where a door no doubt once stood, he made his way to the back of the store which looked to have been a plant shop at one point. Needless to say, all the plants had withered away by now and empty pots stood where flowers once would have grown.

他踏过碎玻璃，那里无疑曾有一扇门，向店铺后方走去，那里曾经似乎是一家植物店。不用说，所有的植物如今都已枯萎，空花盆立在曾经鲜花盛开的地方。

Finding a suitable spot away from the chill that was seeping through the broken door and windows, he gently set Asuka down, being sure that there wasn't any glass on the ground first.

他找到一个远离寒气侵入的破门和窗户的地方，轻轻放下明日香，确保地上没有玻璃碎片。

Standing back up, he turned around and was about to start walking to the beach to get there stuff when Asuka caught his hand and asked-

站起身来，他转过身正要走向海滩去取东西，明日香抓住他的手问道——

"Where are you going?" "你要去哪儿？"

Shinji turned around slowly to look at her. He wasn't sure if she was still scared or what, but she didn't seem to want him to leave. This touched Shinji somewhat.

真嗣缓缓转过身来看着她。他不确定她是否还在害怕，或者别的什么，但她似乎不想让他离开。这让真嗣有些感动。

"I'm going back down there to grab our stuff; the sleeping bags in particular."

"我要下去拿我们的东西，尤其是睡袋。"

Asuka continued holding onto him however, not seeming to let go, and it was only Shinji's next words that seemed to calm her slightly.

然而，明日香依旧紧紧抓着他，似乎不愿放手，直到真嗣接下来的话才让她稍微平静了些。

"Don't worry, I won't be gone very long."

“别担心，我不会离开太久的。”

Asuka took several seconds before she nodded and removed her hand from his. Shinji took several more long looks at her before he left.

明日香过了几秒钟才点点头，松开了手。真嗣又深深地看了她几眼，这才离开。

All in all, it only took him two trips to bring everything up to the building. He managed to pack mostly everything into the camping backpack and only went back the second time to get his sleeping bag. Asuka's he had determined was the priority, so he had placed that inside the pack, hoping it would dry off slightly.

总之，他只用了两趟就把所有东西搬到了楼上。他设法将大部分物品塞进了露营背包，第二次返回只是为了拿睡袋。他认定明日香的是优先项，因此将它放入包内，希望它能稍微晾干些。

As he made his way back into the store, he saw Asuka leaning against the wall he had left her at. At first he thought that she was sleeping, but she slowly opened her eyes and turned towards him. She seemed grim and tired.

当他回到店里时，看到明日香靠在他离开她的那面墙上。起初他以为她在睡觉，但她慢慢地睁开眼睛，转向他。她看起来脸色阴沉，疲惫不堪。

Shinji didn't say anything to her, but started unpacking everything from the pack. The building they were in was no doubt made of wood, but Shinji didn't care right now about that. They needed a fire more than anything and he was determined to make one.

真嗣没有对她说什么，而是开始从背包里拿出所有东西。他们所在的建筑无疑是木制的，但真嗣现在并不在乎这些。他们比任何东西都更需要火，而他决心要生起一堆火。

Gathering up some of the dryer, broken, pieces of wood that littered the front of the store, he tried lighting a fire. After much coaxing and cursing, he finally got it started. It was small, as Shinji didn't want to risk the fire break the floorboards as well. He wouldn't be able to keep it going through the night; an hour would be enough, as long as he watched it.

他收集了一些散落在店铺前干燥、破碎的木片，试图点燃火堆。经过多次哄劝和咒骂，他终于成功了。火很小，因为真嗣不想冒险让火也烧穿地板。他无法整夜维持火势；只要他看着，一个小时就足够了。

Still not looking over at Asuka, he started pulling food out of the backpack. They were both tired right now, but after everything, Shinji was hungry, and he guessed Asuka was as well.

他依旧没有看向明日香，只是开始从背包里取出食物。两人此刻都疲惫不堪，但经历了这么多，真嗣感到饥饿，他猜明日香也一样。

Cooking a small portion of rice for each of them was all he could manage right now though. Carrying Asuka up that slope was more tiring than he had initially thought, and his legs were starting to ache now.

尽管他现在只能为她们每人煮一小份米饭。背着明日香爬上那段坡道比他最初预想的要累得多，现在他的双腿已经开始酸痛了。

Pulling the pot off the fire, he passed it to Asuka along with a plastic spoon and said-

他把锅从火上拿下来，递给明日香一个塑料勺子，说道——

"Here eat this. After everything that happened, some food would do us good."

“来，吃点这个。经历了这么多事，吃点东西对我们有好处。”

Asuka didn't respond, but took the pot from him and ate slowly. Maybe she didn't have an appetite, but she did recognize the need for food at least.

明日香没有回应，但接过锅慢慢吃了起来。也许她没什么胃口，但至少她意识到了需要进食。

Shinji ate his share after her and laid the pot beside him. Pulling her sleeping bag out of the backpack, he laid it beside the fire, hoping it would dry quicker. He likewise did the same with his own.

真嗣在她之后吃完了自己的那份，将锅放在身旁。他从背包里拿出睡袋，铺在火堆旁，希望它能更快干透。他也同样处理了自己的睡袋。

Above them, the thunder continued and they could hear the rain striking the roof covering them. With shelter and fire covering them now though, Shinji wasn't as worried.

在他们上方，雷声持续不断，他们能听到雨水敲打在他们头顶的遮蔽物上。尽管现在有了庇护和火堆，真嗣不再那么担心了。

After several more minutes though, Shinji noticed the fire starting to lick the floorboards instead of the wood he had stacked. Wishing he didn't have to, he reluctantly kicked the fire out, plunging them both into darkness. Flicking on the old lighter, he examined the floorboard the fire had touched. It was slightly charcoaled, but didn't seem in any danger of breaking.

然而，几分钟后，真嗣注意到火开始舔舐地板而不是他堆放的木头。尽管不情愿，他还是踢灭了火，使两人陷入黑暗。他打开旧打火机，检查了火触及的地板。虽然有些焦黑，但似乎没有断裂的危险。

Letting out a low sigh, he sank back on his hands and wished he was anywhere but here.

他低声叹息，双手撑地向后靠去，只愿自己此刻身在别处。

"No fire then?" asked Asuka, after not having spoken for almost a whole hour.

“那就不生火了？”明日香在几乎整整一小时未发一言后问道。

"Can't risk it," said Shinji as he turned towards her. He could just barely make out the outline of her face in the darkened gloom.

“不能冒险。”真嗣转向她答道。在昏暗的光线中，他勉强能辨认出她的轮廓。

Lightning flashed in the distance, lighting of the shop for a brief second, and Shinji's and Asuka's eyes both traveled towards the beach they had recently frequented. It was strange, leaving it really. It wasn't home, not by far, but it was where they had lived for the past month. Leaving it in this state felt odd.

远处闪电划过，短暂照亮了店铺，真嗣和明日香的目光不约而同地投向了他们最近常去的沙滩。离开那里，真是奇怪。那儿算不上家，远非如此，但过去一个月里，他们确实在那里生活。以这种方式离开，感觉很别扭。

'It had to happened eventually,' Shinji reminded himself.

'最终还是发生了，' 真嗣提醒自己。

That was true, but this was so last minute. They didn't even have anytime to think much about it. It was either this or sit in the rain and rot.

这是真的，但这也太临时了。他们甚至没有时间多想。要么这样，要么坐在雨中腐烂。

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka from behind him.

“嘿，真嗣？” 明日香从他身后问道。

Shinji turned his head around to face her, but she was still looking towards the beach. Shinji's eyes were starting to adjust to the dark however, and he thought he saw her motion with her hand. It seemed she was patting the spot next to her, indicating that she wanted him to sit with her.

真嗣转过头来面对她，但她依旧望着海滩。不过，真嗣的眼睛逐渐适应了黑暗，他觉得她似乎在用手示意。她轻轻拍了拍身边的空位，显然是想让他过去坐下。

Shinji paused, not sure if she had understood right, but he saw her eyes flicker over to him, and there meaning seemed simple enough.

真嗣停顿了一下，不确定自己是否理解对了，但他看到她的目光闪烁着转向他，那意思似乎再明白不过了。

He wordlessly stood up then, and walked over to her side and sat down, leaning his back against the wall. They were right next to each other, arms bumping, almost leaning against one another. It was certainly warmer than sitting by oneself.

他默默地站起身，走到她身边坐下，背靠在墙上。他们紧挨着，手臂不时相碰，几乎靠在一起。这确实比一个人坐着要暖和得多。

They sat like that together for a long while, until Asuka said-

他们就这样坐在一起很久，直到明日香开口说——

"I'm sorry about earlier...I shouldn't have...I know we needed to move, but-"

“之前的事，我很抱歉……我不该……我知道我们需要离开，但是——”

She broke off, not sure what she was saying. But Shinji was turned towards her, watching her face. They were dryer, but Asuka's hair looked like a mess. He was sure that she normally kept it sleek and shiny, it had seemed that way when he had first found her. Now though, it looked like she had been living in a ditch.

她话说到一半就停住了，不确定自己在说什么。但真嗣转向了她，注视着她的脸。他们已经不那么湿了，但明日香的头发看起来一团糟。他记得她以前总是把头发打理得光滑亮丽，第一次见到她时就是那样。可现在，她的样子像是刚从沟里爬出来。

"It's fine," mumbled Shinji, "and I'm sorry I got angry. Yes we were in a hurry, but I shouldn't have reacted that way."

“没事的，”真嗣咕哝道，“我为刚才发火道歉。我们确实很赶时间，但我不该那样反应。”

Asuka shook her head. 明日香摇了摇头。

"You were just looking out for me...as you said earlier."

“你只是像之前说的那样，在照顾我。”

Her cheeks brightened briefly at this, but she continued.

她的脸颊因这番话微微泛红，但她继续说道。

"And what you said about friends...I had never thought about that until now. You were just...another person I guess...someone I had to share the misery with. I don't hate you...I used to I suppose...but after you came back..."

“还有你说的关于朋友的事……我直到现在才真正思考过。你曾经只是……我想，是另一个我不得不与之共患难的人。我不恨你……我想我曾一度是恨你的……但自从你回来之后……”

Asuka paused here, but Shinji understood what she saying. She continued however.

明日香在这里停顿了一下，但真嗣明白她的意思。然而她继续说道。

"I'm like you in that aspect though: we both never had any friends. I was an only child, no brothers or sisters, but I didn't have any friends either, not even in college where I kept to myself and my studies. Sure I had people I'd hang out with at school, but nobody I could call close. Nobody I could talk to certainly. Nobody that would listen..."

"不过在这方面我和你很像：我们都没有朋友。我是独生子女，没有兄弟姐妹，也没有朋友，即使在大学里我也总是独来独往，专注于学业。当然在学校里我会和一些人一起玩，但没有谁能称得上亲近。没有人可以倾诉，没有人会倾听......"

"As weird as it it, you're really the only person I've probably talked with much. When you helped me with walking, I enjoyed that, even if it was just pointless conversations. I'd never talked with someone my own age like that before."

"虽然听起来很奇怪，但你真的是我唯一深入交谈过的人。当你帮我练习走路时，我很享受，即使那些对话毫无意义。我以前从未和同龄人这样交谈过。"

Asuka turned towards him and smiled slightly before saying, "I guess I sorta see as a friend as well."

明日香转向他，微微一笑，然后说道："我想我也把你当成朋友了。"

Shinji blinked several times after hearing her say these things. The Asuka he was looking at now wasn't the usual grumpy abrasive one he was used to dealing with. He wouldn't have been surprised if she had laughed then, though only if there situation hadn't been so shitty.

听到她这么说，真嗣眨了好几下眼睛。此刻他眼中的明日香，不再是平日里那个脾气暴躁、难以相处的她。如果她当时笑出声来，他也不会感到意外，尽管那时的情境实在糟糕透顶。

"What did you mean by sorta though?" asked Shinji.

“你说的'有点'是什么意思？”真嗣问道。

Shrugging, Asuka said, "Just that you do get on my nerves sometimes I guess. Though that seems to be usual."

明日香耸了耸肩，说道：“只是有时候你确实会让我心烦意乱吧。不过，那似乎也是常态了。”

"Look who's talking," mumbled Shinji.

"“看看是谁在说话，”真嗣咕哝道。”

Asuka elbowed him in the side then, though she did it without much purpose. She seemed to be in better spirits.

"明日香这时用胳膊肘轻轻碰了他一下，虽然动作没什么目的性。她看起来心情好了些。”

"Say anything else and I'll hit you harder."

"“再说什么我可要揍得更狠了。””

Shinji took this with a grain of salt.

真嗣对此半信半疑。

"What now though?" asked Asuka after a few seconds passed.

"现在怎么办？" 几秒钟后，明日香问道。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Are we going to stay here until the storm passes and move back down, or stay here?"

"我们是等风暴过去再下山，还是就留在这里？"

"Stay here I think," said Shinji.

“我想你留在这里，”真嗣说。

"Don't I get a say in this?"

“难道我不能发表意见吗？”

"Do you have anything to say?"

“你有什么要说的吗？”

"Just that this place is little better than the beach," grumbled Asuka.

"只是这个地方比海滩好不了多少，"明日香抱怨道。

"It has a roof," Shinji pointed out.

"它有屋顶，"真嗣指出。

"Then you may as well call it a house if its got a roof," said Asuka sarcastically.

"那如果它有屋顶，你干脆就叫它房子好了，"明日香讽刺地说。

Shinji didn't reply to this, but did say, "I don't know what we're going to do after the storm passes. Not stay here long I think. A fire can't be lit constantly, and warmth is important right now. How are your legs?"

真嗣没有回应这句话，而是说道：“我不知道风暴过后我们该怎么办。我想不会在这里久留。火不能一直点着，现在保暖很重要。你的腿怎么样了？”

"Better I suppose," said Asuka as she ran a hand down them. "They're not as cold as they were, but standing is probably still difficult, even if my ankle wasn't hurting."

"我想好些了。" 明日香说着，用手抚过它们，"没之前那么冷了，但即便脚踝不疼，站着可能还是困难。"

"Your sleeping bag has dried some," said Shinji as he leaned forward and ran a hand on the fabric.

"你的睡袋已经干了一些。" 真嗣说着，倾身向前，用手抚摸着布料。

Asuka watched as he did this, before she let out a yawn, trying to stifle it. They hadn't gotten much sleep yet, which they were sorely lacking now.

明日香看着他这样做，随后打了个哈欠，试图压抑住。他们还没怎么睡过觉，现在正迫切需要休息。

"Sleep," mumbled Asuka, feeling both tired and unwilling to fall asleep at the same time. She was remembering the dream.

“睡觉，”明日香咕哝着，既感到疲惫又不愿入睡。她正在回忆那个梦。

Shinji turned towards her, watching her. He was half tempted to ask her what she had been dreaming about down on the beach before she started crawling over on hands and knees towards her sleeping bag. She unzipped it and crawled inside, zipping it back up. Half of it was almost dry, the side that was closest to the fire, but Asuka could already feeling her eyelids starting to close.

真嗣转向她，注视着她。他有一半的冲动想问她在海滩上梦见了什么，就在她开始手脚并用爬向睡袋之前。她拉开睡袋的拉链，钻了进去，又拉上了拉链。靠近火堆的那一侧几乎已经干了，但明日香已经感觉到眼皮开始沉重。

"Aren't you going to sleep?" she asked Shinji, her voice growing quieter.

"你不打算睡觉吗？" 她问真嗣，声音渐渐变小。

"In a bit, I'm going to stay awake for a while longer."

"一会儿吧，我想再醒一会儿。"

Asuka looked up at him, realizing that he was sitting almost directly next to her. She almost said something, but stopped herself.

明日香抬头看着他，意识到他就坐在她旁边。她几乎要说些什么，但还是忍住了。

'If he hasn't done anything by now, then there's no reason to suspect he would now,' she thought. She really could trust Shinji she supposed.

'如果他到现在还没做什么，那么就没有理由怀疑他现在会做。' 她想。她想，她真的可以信任真嗣。

With this comforting thought, she very quickly fell asleep, her breathing slowing.

带着这个令人安心的想法，她很快便睡着了，呼吸逐渐放缓。

Shinji watched her for perhaps ten minutes. Sleep was calling him as well, but he wanted to be beside her for a while longer. He couldn't understand why, but he simply wanted this. Maybe he was afraid that she would awake from another dream, this time screaming. But no such thing happened. She continued sleeping peacefully.

真嗣注视着她，或许有十分钟。睡意也在向他招手，但他还想在她身边多待一会儿。他无法理解为什么，但他就是想要这样。也许他是害怕她会从另一个梦中醒来，这次尖叫。但这样的事情并没有发生。她继续安详地睡着。

Shinji eventually got up, and walked towards his sleeping bag.. It was still immensely soaked, but he flung it out and lay on top of it, more content this way instead of inside it. He folded his hands behind his head and closed his eyes, and within minutes, he was out.

真嗣最终站起身，走向他的睡袋。它仍然湿透了，但他把它甩开，躺在上面，这样比在里面更让他感到满足。他将双手叠在脑后，闭上眼睛，不出几分钟，他就睡着了。

Some hours later, Shinji was awoken by someone nudging him gently. Of course it was Asuka. Shinji rolled over to face her and was surprised to see that she was leaning over him. He looked up at her for several seconds and saw that she seemed to have a worried look on her face.

几个小时后，真嗣被某人轻轻推醒。当然是明日香。真嗣翻身面对她，惊讶地发现她正俯身看着自己。他抬头凝视了她几秒钟，注意到她脸上似乎带着忧虑的表情。

"Whats up?" he asked quietly.

"怎么了？" 他轻声问道。

"Can't sleep," mumbled Asuka.

"睡不着，" 明日香咕哝道。

Shinji watched her for several seconds before he sat up and asked, "How come?"

真嗣注视了她几秒钟，然后坐起身来问道："为什么？"

Asuka didn't quite meet his eyes when she replied, "Just couldn't."

明日香回答时并没有直视他的眼睛，"只是做不到。"

Shinji's eyes narrowed, but not maliciously. If he was guessing, it had something to do with what happened earlier. The storm outside continued to rage, but it seemed that the thunder had moved on at least.

真嗣的眼睛微微眯起，但并非出于恶意。如果他在猜测，那一定与之前发生的事情有关。外面的风暴依旧肆虐，但至少雷声已经远去。

Rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand he asked, "Is this something to do with earlier?"

他用手背揉了揉眼睛，问道："这与之前的事有关吗？"

Asuka nodded her head slowly. She seemed nervous and unsure, as though telling Shinji was a mistake that she would be regretting later.

明日香缓缓点头。她显得紧张而不安，仿佛告诉真嗣是一个她日后会后悔的错误。

"Do you...want to talk?" “你……想谈谈吗？”

Shinji wasn't sure if he could do anything to comfort her, but he could at least listen.

真嗣不确定自己能否安慰她，但至少他可以倾听。

"I guess," said Asuka slowly, still unsure.

“我想是吧，”明日香缓缓说道，依旧不太确定。

Shinji nodded and stood up. Asuka watched him and he passed her, until he reached for her sleeping bag which is when she became defensive.

真嗣点点头，站起身来。明日香看着他走过自己，直到他伸手去拿她的睡袋，这时她变得警觉起来。

"What are you doing!?" “你在干什么！？”

"Moving your sleeping bag closer to mine."

"把你的睡袋挪近点儿。"

"I could have moved it myself! And what makes you think I want to sleep next to you either!"

"我自己也能挪！再说，你怎么就觉得我想睡你旁边了！"

"I didn't say anything about sleeping next to each other. Just that it would be better if we both kept warm while you...talked." Shinji wasn't sure how this came off, but he hoped Asuka would understand this logic. And it seemed that she did, after thinking about this for a moment.

"我没说我们要睡在一起。只是说，这样我们都能保暖，而你……可以继续聊。" 真嗣不确定这话听起来如何，但他希望明日香能理解这个逻辑。而她似乎确实在思考片刻后明白了。

"Fine," she said as she crossed her arms, "but the minute this is over, I'm moving away from you."

"好吧，"她交叉双臂说道，"但这件事一结束，我就离你远远的。"

"Yeah," said Shinji, rather uninterested.

"嗯，"真嗣说道，显得颇为漠然。"

He lay her sleeping bag about a foot from his own, and then laid back down on his. Asuka slowly got in her own, watching Shinji as she did so. They had been physically close before, but this felt too much like sleeping together.

他把她的睡袋铺在自己的睡袋旁边约一英尺处，然后重新躺回自己的睡袋里。明日香缓缓钻进自己的睡袋，一边观察着真嗣。他们之前也有过身体上的亲近，但这次感觉太像是在一起睡觉了。

After she crawled in, she covered her head with most of the sleeping bag so that only her face was sticking out. Shinji had to suppress a smile as he saw this, and he sorta thought Asuka knew he had been about to smile.

她爬进去后，用睡袋的大部分盖住头，只露出脸来。真嗣看到这一幕，不得不忍住笑意，他觉得明日香可能知道他差点笑出来。

"What happened?" Shinji asked after a moments pause. He wasn't sure how he was supposed to ask her about a nightmare she had had, but he hoped this would suffice.

“怎么了？”真嗣停顿片刻后问道。他不确定该如何询问她关于噩梦的事，但他希望这样问就够了。

Asuka took even longer to respond, and when she did, it was with subdued breath.

明日香花了更长时间才回应，当她开口时，声音低沉而克制。

"My childhood...wasn't very great, though from what you told me, your's wasn't great either."

“我的童年……并不太好，不过听你说的，你的也不怎么样。”

"Yeah," said Shinji as he was reminded of his father.

“是啊，”真嗣说道，想起了他的父亲。

"I think I mentioned before...that my mother worked at Gehirn, the predecessor of Nerv. Well...she died when I was young. I remember her slightly I suppose, but not much. I was left with my father after her death, and for a while, everything seemed to be fine."

“我想我之前提过……我母亲曾在 Gehirn 工作，那是 Nerv 的前身。嗯……她在我很小的时候就去世了。我大概还记得她一点，但不多。她去世后，我就和父亲一起生活，有一段时间，一切似乎都还好。”

"It starting with the drinking. He would come home nights smelling of alcohol, screaming for me. I was only six or seven at the time, but I can still remember the smell of booze on his breath. He...abused me, is the best way I can put this."

一切始于酗酒。他夜归时浑身酒气，对我大吼大叫。那时我才六七岁，至今仍记得他呼出的酒臭味。他……虐待我，这是我最贴切的描述。

Asuka choked up a little here. Shinji could tell that she was greatly pained by this story, but she continued onward.

明日香在这里哽咽了一下。真嗣能看出这个故事让她极为痛苦，但她还是继续说了下去。

"Then the whoring started. He would bring woman home every few nights, fuck them, and then send them out. A few times I heard him calling them my mothers name, which sickened me greatly. When he was drunk though, he sometimes mistook me for a younger version of my mother. We have the same color of hair you see."

"然后那放荡的生活就开始了。他每隔几晚就会带女人回家，与她们发生关系，然后打发她们走。有几次我听到他叫她们我母亲的名字，这让我感到非常恶心。但当他喝醉时，有时会把我误认为是我母亲的年轻版本。你知道，我们有着相同颜色的头发。"

"I started to be more subdued, not talking back as much, or just learning to live with it. I was seven at the time, so what the fuck could I possibly do? The house rank like rotten food from the trash that never got taken out. Stacks of dirty dishes filled the sink, and the bathroom was covered in shit and vomit half the time."

"我开始变得更加克制，不再那么顶嘴，或者只是学会忍受。那时我才七岁，我他妈能做什么呢？房子里弥漫着腐烂食物的臭味，因为垃圾从未被清理出去。水槽里堆满了脏盘子，而浴室一半的时间都覆盖着屎和呕吐物。"

"I started to think for myself though, vowing to leave that shit hole one day. I managed eventually of course. When I was old enough, I filled some papers and managed to get my way into a college in Germany. This was thanks to Nerv in some aspects I guess, as they knew I was the daughter of Kyoko, thats my mothers name. So I was able to get into college thanks to them. When I came back to tell my father this, that I was leaving, he started shouted at me, saying I was just like my mother. He always resented her for her research and success I suppose."

"不过我开始为自己着想，发誓有一天要离开那个鬼地方。最终我当然做到了。当我足够大时，我填写了一些文件，设法进入了德国的一所大学。这在某种程度上要感谢 Nerv，因为他们知道我是 Kyoko 的女儿，那是我母亲的名字。所以我能进入大学多亏了他们。当我回来告诉父亲我要离开时，他开始对我大喊大叫，说我就像我母亲一样。我想他一直怨恨她因为她的研究和成功。"

Asuka paused here and drew in breath. Her head was starting to hurt again as she remembered all these painful memories.

明日香在这里停顿了一下，深吸一口气。当她回想起这些痛苦的记忆时，头又开始疼了。

"I haven't seen him since I left," she continued. "I kept everything bottled up inside me for the most part and just tried to forget everything since I became an Evangelion pilot. I enjoyed the fact that I had been selected to pilot one, the chosen few. I felt superior then everyone else."

“自从我离开后，我就再也没见过他，”她继续说道，“大部分时间里，我把一切都憋在心里，试图忘记自从成为 EVA 驾驶员以来的一切。我享受着被选中驾驶 EVA 的事实，成为少数精英之一。那时，我感到自己比其他人都要优越。”

"I remembered...things, when you left Shinji," Asuka said. "When I was on the beach...dying reminded me of those times. The smell of that house, the hopelessness, my father, the abuse. I remembered those things that I had purposefully forgotten about. It rushed back to me though, as it did tonight. The thunder might have triggered it, but for a moment, I thought that I was back there. I sometimes think I am when I first wake up, but then I see the things around me and everything comes back. I'm stuck in this damn place with nobody but you...but I'd still prefer my life now than how it was back then."

"我记得...那些事，当你离开真嗣的时候，"明日香说，"当我躺在沙滩上...濒死让我想起了那些时光。那房子的气味，绝望感，我的父亲，那些虐待。我记起了那些我曾刻意遗忘的事情。它们如潮水般涌回，就像今晚一样。雷声或许触发了这一切，但有那么一刻，我以为自己又回到了那里。有时我刚醒来也会这么想，但随后看到周围的一切，记忆便都回来了。我被困在这个该死的地方，除了你别无他人...但我宁愿选择现在的生活，而不是过去的模样。"

Asuka finished talking then, and turned her face to Shinji. She had been speaking to the ceiling this whole time, and only now looked at him.

明日香说完后，转向了真嗣。她一直对着天花板说话，直到现在才看向他。

Shinji's face was passive for the most part, but he was angry, even though he had never met this person.

真嗣的脸上大部分时间都是平静的，但他很生气，尽管他从未见过这个人。

"That-" Shinji started, but Asuka cut him off.

“那-” 真嗣刚开口，就被明日香打断了。

"Don't bother saying anything about him. He's dead, just like millions of other people. I can't say I dislike the thought of his death, but thinking about it isn't doing me any good."

"别费心提起他了。他和成千上万的人一样，已经死了。我不能说我讨厌他死去的想法，但想着这些对我毫无益处。"

"Even so," mumbled Shinji.

"即便如此，" 真嗣喃喃道。"

"Thats from the past," replied Asuka. "I haven't forgiven him, but nor will I forget him. I have to live with that. Just like you and your father."

"那是过去的事了，" 明日香回答道。"我还没有原谅他，但也不会忘记他。我必须接受这一点。就像你和你父亲一样。"

Shinji was silent as she said this. Yes, there stories had certainly similarities he supposed, but he was once again surprised by these similarities. He wouldn't forget about his father, as it was something that he couldn't come to grips with at the same time. If he had said something to him before all this, maybe, but seeing as he was likely dead...

绫波说这话时，真嗣沉默了。是的，他觉得这些故事确实有相似之处，但他再次对这些相似之处感到惊讶。他无法忘记他的父亲，这是他同时无法接受的事情。如果在这之前他对他说了些什么，也许会不同，但既然他很可能已经死了...

"Asuka?" he asked. “明日香？”他问道。

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Why did you decide to tell me this."

"你为什么决定告诉我这些。"

"Brooding over it wasn't doing me any good, and honestly, talking about it feels okay. As I said, I've never had anyone to say these things to. Maybe sleep will come easier now."

"一直闷在心里对我没什么好处，说实话，谈论这些感觉还不错。就像我说的，我从来没有可以倾诉这些的人。也许现在我能更容易入睡了。"

She shrugged after she said this, and they both lapsed into silence.

她说完后耸了耸肩，两人便陷入了沉默。

After several moments though, Asuka slid out of her sleeping bag, and sat up, looking at Shinji.

然而，过了一会儿，明日香从睡袋里钻了出来，坐起身，看着真嗣。

"Um...Shinji?" “呃...真嗣？”

"Huh?" "啊？"

Shinji turned to look at her, and saw that she was fidgeting slightly with her sleeping bag.

真嗣转头看向她，发现她正轻轻摆弄着自己的睡袋。

"What I want to say is...I guess...well...thanks for today, for listening to me, and everything."

“我想说的是……嗯……好吧……谢谢你今天听我说话，还有所有的一切。”

Shinji wouldn't have been surprised if his jaw had dropped; Asuka was actually thanking him?

如果真嗣的下巴真的掉了下来，他也不会感到惊讶；明日香竟然在感谢他？

"We're in this together," he replied, shrugging off his initial surprise. "And arguing about it isn't going to change that."

"我们是一起的，" 他回答道，摆脱了最初的惊讶。"争论这一点并不能改变什么。"

"Doesn't mean I can't dislike it," mumbled Asuka quietly.

"这并不意味着我不讨厌它，" 明日香小声嘀咕道。"

"Dislike it all you want," said Shinji as he sat up as well. "Doesn't change the fact we're stuck together for who knows how long."

"讨厌就讨厌吧，" 真嗣边说边坐起身来。"这改变不了我们不知要在一起多久的现实。"

"Enjoyable," smirked Asuka.

"有趣," 明日香微微一笑。

They sat like that for several seconds, staring at each other until Asuka turned her head away and slowly stood up. This surprised Shinji slightly.

他们就这样坐了几秒钟，互相凝视着，直到明日香转过头去，慢慢站起身来。这让真嗣稍感惊讶。

"Isn't your ankle still hurting?"

"你的脚踝不是还在疼吗？"

"A bit, but its manageable. How do you think I got over here?"

“有一点，但还能应付。你觉得我是怎么过来的？”

Crawling came first to Shinji's mind, but that was a sure way to piss off Asuka.

爬行首先出现在真嗣的脑海中，但那肯定会惹恼明日香。

"Anyway, I'm going to sleep," said Asuka as she rolled up her sleeping bag and carried it away from him. Shinji couldn't help but notice that it wasn't the same spot she had left it. She was closer to him, but not by much.

“总之，我要睡了。”明日香说着，卷起睡袋，从他身边挪开。真嗣不禁注意到，那位置并非她原先放置的地方。她离他更近了些，但也没近多少。

As she lay back down though, Shinji felt there was one last thing he should tell her.

然而，当她再次躺下时，真嗣觉得还有一件事应该告诉她。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"What? I'm trying to fall asleep over here idiot."

“什么？我正努力入睡呢，白痴。”

"I know...just that, if you ever have anything you need to talk about..."

“我知道……只是想说，如果你有什么需要倾诉的……”

Asuka rolled over to face him and said, "Talk to you? Seems almost as pointless as talking to the First Child." She smiled though and said, "But I'll remember that offer I guess. Now goodnight, and don't wake me until breakfast is ready."

明日香翻身面对着他，说道：“跟你说话？简直像跟第一适格者说话一样毫无意义。”但她笑了笑，又说：“不过我会记住你的提议的。现在晚安，早餐准备好之前别叫醒我。”

Without much passage of time, Asuka was fast asleep, her face turned towards Shinji. He fell asleep shortly afterwards, now wrapped in his sleeping bag, which had finally dried. He was glad that Asuka had decided to tell him about this, even if it had been rather morbid. Even if it had been small, they had grown closer.

没过多久，明日香就沉沉睡去，脸朝着真嗣。他随后也睡着了，裹在终于干透的睡袋里。他很高兴明日香决定告诉他这件事，尽管内容颇为阴郁。即便变化微小，他们之间的距离确实拉近了。

The rain had subsided during the night, and only a light drizzle was falling down. Shinji stood outside the shop they were living in and inhaled the clean fresh air. It did at least seem cleaner after the downpour, even if it had initially sucked. The small droplets of water that was falling into his hair did feel refreshing.

雨在夜间停了，现在只有轻柔的细雨飘落。真嗣站在他们居住的店铺外，深吸了一口清新的空气。至少在暴雨过后，空气似乎变得清新了，尽管起初让人不快。水珠轻轻落在他的发间，感觉很是提神。

They had already finished breakfast but had gotten up extremely late, but that was to be expected. Neither of them mentioned what had transpired last night, and Asuka seemed to be determinedly ignoring it. She was pointedly nicer to Shinji, but still seemed to be ashamed of herself over how she had reacted when the thunder had woken them. Shinji didn't say anything, knowing that it would anger her. Talking had been for last night, and Shinji had a feeling that while Asuka had told him about it, she didn't want him telling her everything was okay.

他们已经用过早餐，却起得极晚，这也在情理之中。两人都未提及昨晚发生的事，明日香似乎决心对此置之不理。她对真嗣明显更友善了，但仍对自己在雷声惊醒他们时的反应感到羞愧。真嗣没有说什么，他知道这会激怒她。昨晚是倾诉的时刻，而真嗣有种感觉，尽管明日香向他吐露了心声，但她并不希望他告诉她一切都没事。

She did seem to be able to walk still, which seemed to be a blessing thought Shinji as she walked outside to stand beside him.

她似乎还能走路，这让真嗣觉得是一种幸运，因为她走出屋外，站在了他身边。

"Still raining?" she asked.

“还在下雨吗？”她问道。

"Yeah, but nothing like last night. Its even kinda nice."

“是啊，不过不像昨晚那样。现在还挺不错的。”

"How can you say that after how miserable we were?" Asuka had never liked the rain, as it always depressed her slightly. Shinji was however rather surprised that Asuka had implied we in this topic.

“你怎么能在我们经历了那么多痛苦之后还说这种话？”明日香从未喜欢过雨，因为它总是让她感到些许压抑。然而，真嗣对明日香在这个话题上使用了“我们”一词感到相当惊讶。

"C'mon, lets go back inside," said Asuka after a few moments passed. Shinji would honestly rather have stayed there a few seconds longer, but he followed suit.

"来吧，我们回屋里去，"几分钟后，明日香说道。真嗣其实还想在外面多待一会儿，但他还是跟着进去了。

Shinji had lit the fire while he had been making breakfast, but now, without it burning, the temperature had dropped inside. Shinji sat down on his sleeping bag cross-legged while Asuka sat across from him, leaning up against the wall. She didn't have the sleeping bag wrapping around her, but the hood of her sweatshirt was covering her head, and the drawstrings were pulled so tightly that just her mouth and nose was sticking out. Shinji at first thought to comment on this, but then thought otherwise.

真嗣在做早餐时点燃了火，但现在火熄灭了，屋内的温度也下降了。真嗣盘腿坐在睡袋上，而明日香则坐在对面，靠在墙上。她没有用睡袋裹着，但连帽衫的帽子盖在头上，抽绳拉得紧紧的，只露出嘴巴和鼻子。真嗣起初想对此发表评论，但后来打消了这个念头。

Shinji was just wishing that he had a book to read or something to listen to though when Asuka asked him-

真嗣正希望自己有本书可读或有什么可听的时候，明日香问他——

"Shinji...when the weather clears up...would you be interested in going to the Geofront?"

"真嗣...等天气放晴了...你有兴趣去地底城吗？"

"Geofront?" said Shinji confused, and then he remembered.

"地底城？" 真嗣困惑地说，随即想了起来。

"Where Nerv is?" he asked suddenly interested.

"就是 NERV 总部所在的地方吗？" 他突然感兴趣地问道。

"Yeah," nodded Asuka. "I think it'd be a good idea for the both of us to see it. I doubt anyone is alive there, but it seems to be an important place to the both of us."

"嗯，"明日香点头道，"我觉得我们俩去看看挺好的。那里估计已经没人活着了，但对我们俩来说，那地方似乎挺重要的。"

"True," replied Shinji. "What do you think we'll find though?"

“真的，”真嗣回答，“你觉得我们会找到什么呢？”

"Honestly...nothing in all likely hood. If the city is any indiction, the Geofront isn't much better off."

“老实说……很可能什么都没有。如果城市的情况有任何指示，地底都市也不会好到哪里去。”

"Wouldn't it be safer underground though?"

“不过，地下会不会更安全些？”

"You're forgetting though that the angels were targeting this place because Nerv was here."

"但你忘了，天使们之所以瞄准这个地方，是因为 Nerv 在这里。"

"Oh...right," mumbled Shinji. He had hoped to maybe see one of the Evangelions, but they most likely would have been all destroyed in the battle...if anything had happened of course.

"哦...对啊，" 真嗣喃喃自语。他本希望能看到一台 EVA，但它们很可能已经在战斗中被全部摧毁了...当然，如果真的发生了什么的话。

"Why did you ask though?" wondered Shinji.

"不过，你为什么要问呢？" 真嗣疑惑道。

"I thought that you would like to see for yourself where your father spent most of his time. Myself...well, after...everything I said last night, I felt like visiting Nerv. It was the one place that I felt like I was wanted. Sure the adults talked with there usual bullshit. But some of the people were nice. My guardian in particular looked after me...for the most part at least."

"我以为你会想亲自看看你父亲大部分时间待的地方。至于我...嗯，昨晚说了那些话之后，我觉得去 Nerv 看看。那是唯一让我感觉被需要的地方。当然，大人们还是满口胡言。但有些人挺好的。特别是我的监护人，至少大部分时间都在照顾我。"

Asuka suddenly started to smile, making Shinji confused.

明日香突然开始微笑，这让真嗣感到困惑。

"What was that for?" asked Shinji.

"你笑什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Nothing," Asuka shook her head. "Just remembering something about her."

"没什么，" 明日香摇了摇头。"只是想起了关于她的一些事。"

"Do you know where we could get in though?"

"你知道我们能从哪里进去吗？"

"There were several emergency passages that employees used. Even though the city is little more then ruins, I should be able to find one that we can access."

"有几个员工使用的紧急出口。虽然这座城市几乎成了废墟，但我应该能找到一个我们可以进入的通道。"

Shinji nodded his head then, thinking about that point when he would be able to see Nerv.

碇真嗣那时点了点头，心中想着何时才能看到 NERV 的景象。

Asuka however was watching the passive look on his face and eventually had to say, "I'm surprised you're not more exited about this. You've been asking questions about Nerv at almost every chance you got. I'm sick of it honestly."

然而，明日香却在观察着他那被动的表情，最终不得不说道：“我真没想到你对此并不更兴奋。你几乎每次有机会都在问关于 NERV 的问题。说实话，我真是听腻了。”

"I just don't know what to think of it I guess. Hearing about it and seeing are two different things. Not to mention, my father was the director, and that I might have worked there if the angels hadn't attacked."

“我想我只是不知道该怎么看待这一切。听说的和亲眼所见是两码事。更不用说，我父亲曾是那里的指挥官，如果不是使徒袭击，我可能已经在那里工作了。”

"I guess if you're that worried, we don't have to go then," said Asuka, teasing him.

“我想如果你这么担心的话，那我们就不必去了。”明日香逗他说。

"I'm fine," said Shinji rather harshly.

"我没事," 真嗣相当生硬地说道。

"God, I was just kidding idiot," scowled Asuka.

"天啊，我只是开个玩笑，笨蛋," 明日香皱眉道。

"Forget it," said Shinji. "If the rain lets up tomorrow, then we can start searching."

"算了," 真嗣说。"如果明天雨停了，我们就可以开始搜索了。

Asuka rolled her eyes and sighed, forgetting about his stupidity. Shinji however was wondering what the Geofront looked liked. Asuka had told him it had an underground lake at the very least, but other than that, she hadn't said much.

明日香翻了个白眼，叹了口气，不再理会他的愚蠢。然而，真嗣却在想地底都市是什么样子。明日香至少告诉过他那里有一个地下湖，除此之外，她就没多说什么了。

Whether they would have gone there if Asuka hadn't told him about her father, Shinji wondered about this. It was certainly an important place for the both of them, no getting around that fact he supposed, maybe even more so for Asuka.

真嗣在想，如果不是明日香告诉他关于她父亲的事，他们会不会去那里。那地方对他们俩来说无疑很重要，这一点无可否认，也许对明日香来说更是如此。

They had grown closer since last night Shinji supposed, and this was a step in the right direction. But, he was nervous all the same about what might await them down in the bowels of the Geofront.

真嗣觉得，自从昨晚以来，他们之间的关系更近了，这是一个正确的方向。但是，对于地底都市深处可能等待着他们的未知，他同样感到紧张。

### Chapter 7: Return

Longer chapter here then what I've done so far, but I'll talk more about stuff at the end of this.

这里的内容比目前为止我所做的要长，但我会在最后详细谈谈。

---

The rain continued drizzling down into the next day, though this didn't stop Shinji and Asuka from starting there journey to the Geofront. There going was still slow however. Asuka could walk well enough, but she did tire out easily, and they had to stop several times. Thankfully, Shinji had brought plenty of food for the journey. He was a little worried about the water, but if the rain continued to drizzle down, then they should be fine.

雨继续淅淅沥沥地下到第二天，但这并没有阻止真嗣和明日香前往地底都市的旅程。然而，他们的行进依然缓慢。明日香虽然能走，但很容易疲劳，他们不得不多次停下来休息。幸运的是，真嗣带了足够的食物。他有点担心水的问题，但如果雨继续这样下，他们应该没问题。

Though Shinji had already seen the city in great detail, Asuka kept on turning her head as she looked around. Shinji wasn't sure if she was surprised by the surroundings or simply curious. He rather suspected it was this last one. She seemed to be mumbling occasionally about the devastation, and Shinji had a strong suspicion about what she thought had caused all this.

尽管真嗣已经非常详细地看过这座城市，但明日香还是不停地转头四处张望。真嗣不确定她是被周围的景象震惊了，还是仅仅出于好奇。他更倾向于后者。她似乎偶尔会喃喃自语关于这片废墟的事，真嗣强烈怀疑她认为这一切的罪魁祸首是什么。

They had left earlier that morning, just as the sun was beginning to rise. Though now, it was closer to noon.

他们一早就出发了，那时太阳刚刚开始升起。而现在，时间已接近中午。

They took a break again for lunch, both eating in silence for a greater part of the time. Asuka still seemed to be intrigued about the state of Tokyo-3, and Shinji was wondering what Nerv would look like.

他们再次停下来吃午饭，大部分时间两人都沉默地吃着。明日香似乎仍然对第三新东京市的状态感到好奇，而真嗣则在想 NERV 会是什么样子。

Finishing lunch, they packed up and continued on there way. Several times, Asuka paused at certain points and just looked at a building or maintenance access before shaking her head. Shinji didn't ask, but he assumed these were places that Nerv employees could gain access to the Geofront through. Unfortunately, most places they passed were completely crushed.

吃完午饭，他们收拾好行李继续前行。有好几次，明日香在某些地方停下脚步，凝视着某个建筑或维修通道，然后摇了摇头。真嗣没有问，但他猜想这些地方可能是 NERV 员工进入地底都市的通道。不幸的是，他们经过的大多数地方都已被彻底摧毁。

The rain started relenting, as the sun was high in the sky and they had to take another break, since Asuka was starting to get tired.

雨势开始减弱，太阳高悬天空，他们不得不再次休息，因为明日香开始感到疲惫。

Leaning against the shade of a building that miraculously had its awning still intact, Asuka downed the bottle of water that Shinji had passed her mere moments ago. The sun was slowing them down more so than the rain had, and Asuka seemed to be tiring out easier. Once or twice, Shinji saw her wince. Even though it had only been a sprain, her ankle must still be hurting.

明日香靠在一栋建筑的阴影下，这栋建筑奇迹般地保留了遮阳篷。她一口气喝完了真嗣刚刚递给她的那瓶水。阳光比雨水更拖慢了他们的步伐，明日香似乎更容易感到疲倦。真嗣一两次看到她皱眉。尽管只是扭伤，她的脚踝肯定还在疼。

"Maybe we should just head back," said Shinji as he leaned against the building with her.

“也许我们该回去了，”真嗣说着，靠在建筑物上，与她并肩。

Asuka turned towards him and simply frowned, showing her displeasure at this.

明日香转向他，只是皱了皱眉，表达出她的不满。

"Its just a suggestion," said Shinji. "Its not like the Geofront is going anywhere, and who knows how long it'll take to find an access point we can use."

“这只是个建议，”真嗣说，“反正第三新东京市也不会跑掉，谁知道要花多长时间才能找到一个我们能用的入口。”

"I'd rather do this now," said Asuka.

“我宁愿现在就做，”明日香说。

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"If I ignore it later, I may not be able to go back."

“如果我以后忽视它，可能就回不去了。”

Shinji would have loved to ask why, but he thought it was a personal answer she didn't want to answer. Maybe she had another reason she wanted to go to the Geofront then what she alluded last night.

真嗣本想问为什么，但他觉得这可能是她不想回答的个人问题。也许她想去地底都市的理由和她昨晚暗示的有所不同。

"We aren't going back," stated Asuka firmly.

“我们不会回去的。”明日香坚定地说。

Almost with that thought, she pushed herself off the wall, and started walking forward. This was so sudden that Shinji had to struggle to gather up the backpack he had dumped next to them.

几乎在那一念之间，她推开墙壁，开始向前走去。这一切来得如此突然，以至于真嗣不得不努力捡起他刚才扔在他们旁边的背包。

Just as Shinji had once noticed, as they got further into the city, the buildings here seemed to be even more demolished. It wasn't unusual to just see entire city blocks completely destroyed. Skyscrapers had fallen down, making it difficult to navigate across sometimes. Shinji was still worried that the infrastructure in some of these buildings weren't the best, so they tried to avoid these ones.

正如真嗣曾经注意到的那样，随着他们深入城市，这里的建筑似乎更加破败。整片街区被彻底摧毁并不罕见。摩天大楼倒塌，有时难以穿越。真嗣仍然担心这些建筑中的一些基础设施并不完善，所以他们尽量避开这些地方。

They passed more potential access points, all of which Asuka ignored. It seemed that there was a particular one she had in mind, but how far it was, was a different story. Shinji was starting to wonder if they would even find one before night time. They hadn't brought any flash lights, which now that he thought about it, was a problem. Even if they did find this place, if they didn't have light, there wasn't much hope.

他们经过更多可能的入口，但都被明日香忽略了。看来她心中有一个特定的目标，但距离多远则是另一回事。真嗣开始怀疑他们是否能在天黑前找到一个。他们没有带手电筒，现在想来，这是个问题。即使找到了这个地方，如果没有光亮，希望也不大。

They continued walking in silence, Shinji only trying to talk for the sake of it, but Asuka seemed more focussed on her goal. She seemed determined, or obsessed might have been a better way of putting it. Shinji was starting to worry about her, as she seemed to continue pushing herself forward, even though each step seemed to be more tiring then the last.

他们继续默默前行，真嗣只是为了打破沉默而试图交谈，但明日香似乎更专注于她的目标。她显得坚定，或者说执着可能更贴切。真嗣开始担心她，因为她似乎一直在推动自己前进，尽管每一步都比上一步更加疲惫。

After another hour of this however, Shinji had to say something. Asuka had stumbled many times since there last break point, but every time Shinji tried to help her, she had refused him rudely. Now that she could walk on her own, she didn't want any help from him. Shinji couldn't call this walking however; she was stumbling around more than walking now.

然而，又过了一个小时，真嗣不得不开口了。自上次休息后，明日香已经跌跌撞撞了好几次，但每次真嗣试图帮助她时，她都粗鲁地拒绝了。现在她能自己走了，就不想再接受他的帮助。不过，真嗣觉得这根本不算是走路；她现在跌跌撞撞的次数比走路还多。

"Asuka, thats enough," said Shinji as he stopped and swung off his pack. The sun was beginning to set now, and he figured now was the best time to halt.

"明日香，够了。" 真嗣说着停下脚步，卸下背包。太阳开始西沉，他觉得现在是停下来休息的最佳时机。

"No, we can still go further," said Asuka as she stood there, sweat dripping off her brow.

“不，我们还能走得更远，”明日香站在那里说道，汗水顺着她的额头滴落。

"You're exhausted, and it hasn't even been a week since you started walking again."

“你已经筋疲力尽了，而且你重新开始走路还不到一周。”

"I don't need your pity."

“我不需要你的同情。”

"I'm not trying to pity you, I'm just trying to watch out for you."

"我不是在可怜你，只是想关心你。"

"Well stop. Its disgusting."

"那就别这样了。太恶心了。"

'Stubborn as always,' thought Shinji with a sigh.

“一如既往的固执，”真嗣叹息着想。

"We can resume this tomorrow when we actually have daylight. Or would you rather find your way in the dark?"

"我们可以在明天白天光线充足时再继续。或者你宁愿在黑暗中摸索？"

Asuka scowled at him, but heard the reasoning behind this. Still unhappy about this, she turned around to face Shinji and said, "Fine," before walking past him.

明日香对他皱了皱眉，但理解其中的道理。尽管心中不悦，她还是转身面对真嗣，说了声“好吧”，然后从他身边走过。

They made the best of things as they rolled out there sleeping bags in the middle of the road. Shinji didn't want to worry about starting a fire in a building, so sleeping on the asphalt was the best, if not most comfortable, decision. He went around to the buildings that lined the street and grabbed whatever bits of wood he could find to start the fire. With the rain having stopped, getting the fire to light was much easier as well.

他们尽量利用现有条件，在路中央铺开了睡袋。真嗣不想在建筑物内生火，因此睡在柏油路上虽不舒适，却是最佳选择。他绕着街道两旁的建筑物，捡拾能找到的木片来生火。雨已经停了，生火也变得容易许多。

Dinner was nothing special, as it usually was, and afterwards, Asuka lay down on her sleeping bag and let out a low sigh of relief.

晚餐一如既往地普通，饭后，明日香躺在她的睡袋上，发出了一声低沉的叹息，似乎松了口气。

'See, you were tired,' thought Shinji smugly.

“看吧，你就是累了。”真嗣得意地想着。

He was a bit tired himself however, so he lay down on his own. It certainly wasn't the most comfortable, but it would do, and something about sleeping next to the fire again felt right.

他自己也有点累了，于是便躺了下来。虽然这肯定不是最舒服的，但勉强可以，而且再次睡在火堆旁感觉很对。

"Asuka, can I ask you something?"

"明日香，我能问你个问题吗？"

Silence greeted his question for a few seconds until she finally replied.

他的问题问出后，沉默了几秒钟，她终于回答了。

"Fine...what?" “好吧……什么？”

"Is it possible any of the Evangelions are there...at Nerv I mean?"

"那里会不会有任何一台 EVA...我是说在 Nerv？"

Shinji didn't think Asuka was going to reply to this, because she took a long time to reply. Though when she finally did-

真嗣没想到明日香会回答这个问题，因为她花了很长时间才回应。不过当她最终开口时——

"Its not entirely impossible, though unlikely as well."

"并非完全没有可能，尽管同样不太可能。"

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"I would think you would have figured it out for yourself by now Shinji," said Asuka with an annoyed sigh. "The buildings around are evidence enough for that. Whatever happened here, the best bet would be that the Evangelions had some involvement in it."

"我以为你到现在应该自己想明白了，真嗣。"明日香带着不耐烦的叹息说道，"周围的建筑就是最好的证据。无论这里发生了什么，最有可能的是，这件事与 EVA 有关。"

"But you said that there were three of them."

“但你说过他们有三个人。”

"Yeah," nodded Asuka. "Unit 00 was the First's, and Unit 02 was my own. Unit 01 however didn't have a pilot yet. At least one Evangelion helped with this destruction though, along with the angels as well."

“嗯，”明日香点头道，“零号机是绫波的，二号机是我的。但初号机还没有驾驶员。至少有一台 EVA 参与了这场破坏，还有那些使徒。”

"Then your own and Unit 01 might still be at Nerv then."

“那么你自己的二号机和初号机可能还在 NERV 那里。”

"Maybe," replied Asuka slowly.

“或许吧，”明日香缓缓回答。

In reality though, she wasn't sure of this. If Unit 02 was still at Nerv, then why had she been in her plug suit when she had awoken on the beach. There was still the problem of her missing memory as well, not to mention Shinji's. Her best guess was that she had participated in whatever had happened here, even if she couldn't remember it, and this worried her. What could have happened that affected her memory so badly? There were too many unanswered questions about what had actually happened here in Tokyo-3 and it bothered her.

然而在现实中，她对此并不确定。如果二号机仍在 NERV，那么为何她在海滩上醒来时穿着插入栓服。她缺失的记忆问题依然存在，更不用说真嗣的记忆了。她最好的猜测是，她参与了这里发生的任何事情，即使她记不起来，这让她感到担忧。究竟发生了什么，以至于她的记忆受损如此严重？关于东京-3 这里实际发生的事情，有太多未解之谜，这让她感到困扰。

"Even if any of them are still there, getting to them would be entirely different. With no electricity, the elevators will be down and theres no guarantee that the maintenance access wont have escaped any damage," said Asuka.

"即使他们中还有人留在那里，要找到他们也将是完全不同的挑战。没有电力，电梯会停运，而且无法保证维修通道没有受到任何损坏。" 明日香说道。

"Aren't you at least curious though?" asked Shinji.

“难道你至少不好奇吗？” 真嗣问道。

Was she? Asuka didn't know. She had to see Nerv first though until she could decide what she wanted to do afterwards. She had strong ties to the place afterall, even if she didn't want to admit it. Her life was certainly different now, tied up with the idiot across the fire from her. Maybe she just wanted some finality from her past life. Until she saw Nerv though, she couldn't come to grips with that.

她好奇吗？明日香不知道。她必须先看看 NERV，然后才能决定之后想做什么。毕竟，她与这个地方有着紧密的联系，即使她不想承认。她的生活现在肯定不同了，与火堆对面的那个白痴紧密相连。也许她只是想从过去的生活中找到一些终结。但在看到 NERV 之前，她无法真正面对这一点。

"I don't know," replied Asuka slowly. This was how she actually felt.

“我不知道，”明日香缓缓回答。这是她真实的感受。

Shinji stared across the fire at her, seeing the shadows from the fire dancing across her face. Asuka was caught between some turmoil, that much was obvious. If she didn't want to say whatever it was, then that was fine as well, but Shinji at least hoped that seeing Nerv would alleviate some of this pain.

真嗣隔着火堆凝视着她，火光在她脸上跳跃的影子清晰可见。明摆着，明日香正陷于某种纷扰之中。如果她不想说，那也没关系，但真嗣至少希望看到 NERV 能减轻一些她的痛苦。

"I'm going to sleep," said Asuka as she turned away from him.

“我要睡了，”明日香说着，转过身背对着他。

'Probably best to,' thought Shinji as well. And he was tired.

“或许这样最好，”真嗣也这么想。而且他也累了。

He had his own thoughts about Nerv as well, even if he didn't mention them. Even though he had never been to the place, he felt that so much of his recent life was wrapped up in the place. A part of him even worried that things would change once they got there.

他对 Nerv 也有自己的看法，尽管他从未提及。尽管他从未去过那个地方，但他觉得最近的生活中有太多与那里紧密相连。他甚至担心一旦到达那里，事情会发生改变。

'No sense worrying,' thought Shinji as he rolled over and was out within minutes.

'担心也无济于事，'真嗣想着，翻了个身，几分钟内就睡着了。

Shinji woke up abruptly that next morning as Asuka woke him up by rolling him over with the edge of her foot. As Shinji looked up at her, he could tell that she was in no mood for arguments. He quickly made breakfast, and with that, they were off, just as the sun was beginning to rise. It seemed Asuka planned on finding the maintenance access today, judging by the pace she was setting.

第二天清晨，真嗣被明日香用脚尖猛地一推，突然惊醒。当他抬头看向她时，他能感觉到她此刻毫无争论的心情。他迅速做好了早餐，随后他们便出发了，正好太阳开始升起。从明日香设定的步伐来看，她似乎计划今天找到维修通道。

It was starting to look like a battlefield here as they continued onward into areas of the city Shinji hadn't even seen yet. Buildings on either side of them were little more than heaps of rubble, and once or twice, they saw what appeared to be armored vehicles that had been crushed to dust. It almost looked like a war had broken out or something.

随着他们继续深入真嗣从未见过的城市区域，这里开始变得像战场一样。两侧的建筑物不过是废墟堆，他们还一两次看到了似乎是被碾成尘埃的装甲车。这几乎像是爆发了一场战争似的。

Shinji thought about bringing this up to Asuka, but realized she was in her own world. She was walking with her arms crossed, her head turning many different ways as she took in the environment. Once or twice they stopped so she could figure out where they were. She seemed to have a very good layout of Tokyo-3 already in her mind, even though she hadn't been into the city as much as Shinji had. But again, he had to remind himself, that she probably memorized the layout of the city on orders from Nerv incase something like this did happen.

真嗣考虑过向明日香提起这件事，但他意识到她正沉浸在自己的世界里。她双臂交叉地走着，头不停地转向各个方向，观察着周围的环境。有一两次他们停下来，让她弄清楚他们所在的位置。她似乎已经在脑海中对第三新东京市有了一个很好的布局，尽管她进入这座城市的次数并不如真嗣多。但真嗣不得不提醒自己，她可能是在 NERV 的命令下，为了应对类似情况而记住了城市的布局。

"Hold on," said Asuka as she stopped moving suddenly.

“等等，”明日香突然停下脚步说道。

"What?" said Shinji, suddenly feeling nervous. Was something wrong?

“什么？” 真嗣突然感到紧张。是有什么不对劲吗？

Asuka stood there for a few seconds looking at a store across the street. She seemed to be contemplating something.

明日香站在那里，目光穿过街道望向对面的商店，似乎在沉思着什么。

"Wait here for a second," said Asuka as she started walking towards it.

"在这里等一下，" 明日香说着，开始朝那边走去。

"Shouldn't I-" "我是不是应该-"

"Wait," repeated Asuka with more force in her voice now.

"等等，" 明日香重复道，这次她的声音更加有力。

Shinji was left to stand there with the pack on his shoulders as Asuka walked into the abandoned store. It was more or less intact, but even this didn't put an end to Shinji's worry. What if the roof collapsed suddenly and Asuka was trapped inside...or crushed by the falling debris.

真嗣肩上扛着背包，独自站在那里，看着明日香走进那家废弃的商店。商店大体上还算完好，但即便如此，真嗣的担忧并未因此消散。万一屋顶突然坍塌，明日香被困在里面...或是被坠落的碎片压住怎么办。

Shinji didn't have to worry however, as Asuka walked out moments later, stepping around the fallen glass as she did.

不过，真嗣的担忧并未持续多久，因为明日香很快就走了出来，小心翼翼地绕过地上的碎玻璃。

"Why did you go in by yourself?" asked Shinji the moment that she returned.

"你怎么自己进去了？" 她一回来，真嗣就问道。

"Like you'd know what to look for even if there was a way into Nerv right in front of your face," said Asuka. She continued looking at Shinji however, rather surprised at how annoyed he seemed.

“就算 NERV 的入口就摆在你面前，你也未必知道该找什么。”明日香说道。她继续看着真嗣，对他表现出的恼怒感到有些惊讶。

"Were you worried by any chance?" asked Asuka with a slight laugh.

“你该不会是在担心吧？”明日香带着一丝笑意问道。

Shinji didn't reply, now feeling embarrassed over how he had reacted.

真嗣没有回答，现在他为自己刚才的反应感到尴尬。

"Well, there is an access point in there," said Asuka, ignoring the silence between them.

"嗯，那里有一个接入点，" 明日香说道，忽略了他们之间的沉默。

"Are you sure?" asked Shinji.

"你确定吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Its the only one I used, so yes, I am."

"这是我唯一用过的，所以是的，我确定。"

This surprised Shinji. 这让真嗣感到惊讶。

"You've used it before?" “你以前用过它吗？”

"Yeah, when I first came here. I had a long day of tests and wanted to escape and walk around the city for a while. I used this to escape."

“是的，当我第一次来这里时。我经历了一整天的测试，想要逃离并在这座城市里走走。我用这个逃脱了。”

"Does it take us to Nerv?"

"它能带我们去 Nerv 吗？"

"Not exactly. It'll take us to the Geofront, but from there, we'll have to walk the rest of the way to Nerv. Even so, its better than any other option I can find."

"不完全是。它会带我们到地底都市，但从那里我们得步行到 Nerv。即便如此，这比我能找到的其他任何选项都要好。"

Together, they both walked into the store and Asuka directed him down to the basement where it was. Shinji was rather surprised that it was little more than a manhole covering a ladder. Though as Asuka explained, this was incase all electricity went out in the city. It may be rudimentary, but it did work. She was also very adamant about her going first and Shinji afterwards. Shinji didn't think this made any sense, as he was the one carrying the pack, and if he lost his footing, then they would both fall. Asuka wasn't budging on this however.

他们一起走进商店，Asuka 领着他下到地下室。Shinji 对这不过是一个盖着梯子的井盖感到相当惊讶。但正如 Asuka 解释的那样，这是为了防止城市电力完全中断。虽然原始，但确实有效。她还非常坚持要自己先下去，Shinji 随后。Shinji 觉得这毫无道理，因为他才是背着背包的人，如果他失足，两人都会摔倒。然而 Asuka 在这点上毫不让步。

They slowly started descending the ladder. Down and down it went until darkness completely engulfed them. Shinji was taking his time finding the next placement for his foot. His greatest fear was that he would suddenly find that there wasn't anymore ladder.

他们缓缓开始下梯子。梯子一节节向下延伸，直到黑暗完全吞噬了他们。真嗣小心翼翼地寻找着下一个落脚点。他最害怕的是突然发现梯子已经到头了。

Asuka seemed to be fine, maybe because she had already done this before, but she started taking it slower as well as they continued downwards. How far had they come? They were certainly far underneath Tokyo-3 by now.

明日香似乎很从容，也许因为她以前做过类似的事，但随着他们继续向下，她也放慢了速度。他们已经下到了多深的地方？现在肯定已经远在第三新东京市的地下了。

Just as Shinji wondering if this was ever going to stop, Asuka called a stop. They hadn't stopped at all or said anything since the descent, so this came as something of a surprise to Shinji.

正当真嗣疑惑这会不会没完没了时，明日香喊了停。自从开始下降以来，他们一直没有停下或说过话，这让真嗣感到有些意外。

"What is it?" asked Shinji.

"这是什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Hand me the lighter," said Asuka.

"把打火机递给我，" 明日香说。

Shinji dug it out of his pocket and handed it to her. Asuka flicked it on and looked down below. There was a slight drop, maybe ten feet or so. Simple enough. Problem was, Asuka new it wasn't like this the first time she had used the ladder. Bending down to look at the end of the ladder, she saw that it had been cleanly cut by something. She bit her lips in frustration. Certainly nobody had been down here since Tokyo-3 had become a wasteland, so the only thing that made sense was that somebody had done this during whatever had happened in Tokyo-3.

真嗣从口袋里掏出它，递给了她。明日香轻按开关，低头望去。下方有个小落差，大约十英尺左右。简单得很。问题是，明日香清楚记得第一次使用这梯子时并非如此。她弯腰查看梯子的末端，发现它被某种东西整齐地切断了。她懊恼地咬了咬嘴唇。自东京-3 沦为废墟以来，显然无人踏足此地，因此唯一合理的解释是，在东京-3 发生的某次事件中，有人动了手脚。

'Is it possible the government intervened in Nerv for some reason?' thought Asuka. They had certainly seen vehicles that looked military like, and even the battleships that littered the bay of Tokyo-3 came to mind. She chose not to tell any of this to Shinji however.

"政府会不会出于某种原因介入了 NERV？"明日香暗自思忖。他们的确见过那些看似军用的车辆，甚至连散布在第三新东京湾的战舰也浮现在脑海中。但她决定不把这些告诉真嗣。

"Its a bit of a drop," said Asuka as she looked up the ladder at him.

"这有点陡峭，" 明日香抬头看着梯子上的他说道。

"How much is a bit?"

"多少算有点？"

"Ten feet." "十英尺。"

Shinji felt slight relief from that. Ten feet wasn't bad, though the pack would weigh him down slightly.

这让真嗣感到些许宽慰。十英尺不算太糟，尽管背包会让他稍微有些负担。

Moments later, Asuka jumped and landed easily at the bottom. Turning around, she directed the light to Shinji so he could see where he was jumping. He jumped, though not as gracefully as Asuka had, and landed with a thud as the pack brought him down on his butt. Asuka had to suppress a grin as she walked over to him and held out a hand to help him up.

片刻后，明日香轻松地跳下并稳稳落地。她转身将灯光照向真嗣，以便他能看清跳跃点。他跳了下去，虽然没有明日香那般优雅，落地时背包让他一屁股坐到了地上。明日香强忍笑意，走过去向他伸出手，帮助他起身。

"That was a funny flail," said Asuka with a smirk.

“刚才那下乱挥挺滑稽的。”明日香带着一丝戏谑说道。

Shinji didn't reply, feeling that his pride was somehow hurt. Something else bothered him however.

真嗣没有回答，感觉自己的自尊心受到了某种伤害。然而，还有其他事情困扰着他。

"Didn't your ankle hurt from that Asuka?"

“你的脚踝不疼吗，从那次被明日香踩了之后？”

"Not really, I placed most of my weight on my other foot."

“其实还好，我把大部分重量都放在另一只脚上了。”

Shinji was again surprised at how athletic Asuka seemed to be.

真嗣再次惊讶于明日香的运动能力。

They walked forward now, Asuka leading with the lighter. She seemed to know exactly which way to go now. They turned down several hallways all having adjacent hallways which led off in different directions. Shinji knew that if he had tried this himself, he would have been lost right at the start.

他们现在向前走去，明日香拿着打火机带路。她似乎知道确切的方向。他们转过几个走廊，每个走廊都有相邻的通道通向不同的方向。真嗣知道，如果他自己尝试，一开始就会迷路。

They rounded another corner and Asuka led them to a door. Trying to turn the door knob had no affect however. Setting down his pack, Shinji walked over and pushed against it, throwing his weight against the door. Asuka did likewise, and they got the door open. Darkness greeted them again, and Asuka led the way down the stairwell.

他们又转过一个拐角，明日香带他们来到一扇门前。试图转动门把手却没有效果。真嗣放下背包，走过去用力推门，将全身重量压在门上。明日香也照做，门终于被打开了。黑暗再次迎接他们，明日香领着大家走下楼梯。

"Where is this taking us?" asked Shinji.

“这是要带我们去哪儿？”真嗣问道。

"The Geofront...or it should unless something happened," said Asuka.

“地底都市……除非出了什么状况，否则应该就是这里。”明日香回答道。

They went down several more flights of stairs until they reached another door. This one opened quite easily, and Shinji and Asuka walked out into the Geofront.

他们又下了几层楼梯，直到抵达另一扇门。这扇门轻易地打开了，真嗣和明日香便走进了地底都市。

Shinji was momentarily blinded as he walked out, and had to shield his eyes with his hand as the sun beat down on him. It took Shinji several seconds for the absurdity of this thought to take hold, but as he looked up, he saw where the sun was coming from. A gaping hole opened up above the Geofront, letting sunlight rain into the underground facility. Shinji marveled at this for several seconds until he turned to Asuka and saw the surprised look on her face.

走出时，真嗣一时被阳光刺得睁不开眼，不得不用手遮挡。他花了好几秒才意识到这个想法的荒谬，但当他抬头时，看到了阳光的来源。一个巨大的洞口在 Geofront 上方敞开，让阳光洒入地下设施。真嗣对此惊叹了几秒，直到他转向明日香，看到了她脸上的惊讶表情。

"What is it?" he asked.

“怎么了？”他问道。

"That hole...isn't supposed to be there," she mumbled.

“那个洞……不应该在那里的，”她喃喃道。

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Reinforced layers cover the entirety of the Geofront so that it isn't supposed to be penetrated from anything."

加固层覆盖了整个 Geofront，因此它不应该被任何东西穿透。

"Then what did it?" asked Shinji.

“那到底是什么？”真嗣问道。

Asuka was silent, but the only thing she knew that could do something like that was an N2 bomb. Again, the thought that the government had interfered somehow started to grow on her mind. But that was in the past.

明日香沉默不语，但她唯一知道能造成这种效果的东西是 N2 炸弹。再次，她心中政府可能介入的想法开始滋生。但那都是过去的事了。

"C'mon," said Asuka as she ignored Shinji's question.

“快点，”明日香说着，对真嗣的问题置若罔闻。

They walked along the path, getting closer to Nerv. Shinji was surprised to see that there was grass down here as well as trees and when he asked Asuka about this, she said it had something to do with terraforming.

他们沿着小径前行，逐渐接近 NERV 总部。真嗣惊讶地发现这里也有草地和树木，当他向明日香询问时，她解释说这与地球化改造有关。

As they passed more trees, the lake came into view, as well as the headquarters of Nerv. Shinji stood on a hill overlooking everything and marveled that human engineering could make something like this. The lake in the middle of course was filled with the LCL fluid, but Nerv looked more or less intact.

随着他们穿过更多的树木，湖面和 NERV 总部映入眼帘。真嗣站在山丘上俯瞰这一切，惊叹于人类工程能创造出这样的景象。当然，湖中充满了 LCL 液体，但 NERV 总部看起来大致完好无损。

"Is that it then?" asked Shinji as he pointed to the pyramid shaped building.

“那就是了吗？”真嗣指着金字塔形的建筑问道。

"Yeah," replied Asuka. "Thats the headquarters of Nerv."

“嗯，”明日香回答道，“那是 NERV 的总部。”

The structure was exactly in the shape of a pyramid, but entirely black and very smooth it seemed. Directly next to it was the lake filled with the LCL fluid. Shinji and Asuka followed the path down to the lake and refilled their water bottles first before continuing onward.

这座建筑完全呈金字塔形状，但通体漆黑且异常光滑。紧邻其旁的是一个充满 LCL 液体的湖泊。真嗣和明日香沿着小径下到湖边，先给水壶重新装满水，然后继续前行。

As they neared the giant pyramid however, Shinji had to ask something.

然而，当他们接近那座巨大的金字塔时，真嗣不得不提出一个问题。

"How exactly are we supposed to get in there?"

“我们究竟该怎么进去呢？”

Asuka stopped in her tracks; she hadn't thought of that in all honesty. Just getting to the Geofront seemed difficult enough as it was.

明日香突然停下脚步；老实说，她从未考虑过这一点。光是到达地底都市就已经够困难的了。

"Without power, I'm not entirely sure. Though there should be a side entrance somewhere we can use."

“没有电力，我不太确定。不过应该有个侧门我们可以利用。”

"How long were you here for exactly?" asked Shinji, slightly accusingly.

“你到底在这里待了多久？”真嗣略带责备地问道。

"One week or so," said Asuka. 'Or more,' she later thought. 'Depends on if you include the memory loss.'

"大约一周吧，" 明日香说道。'或者更久，' 她随后想道。'取决于你是否把失忆的时间也算进去。'

"Well, I'll think about that in a minute though. Lunch sounds good right now."

"嗯，这个我一会儿再考虑。现在吃午饭听起来不错。"

Shinji had to agree, so he started pulling stuff out of the backpack to cook with. They ate lunch just above the lake, sitting on a slope that overlooked it. It was nice down here Shinji had to admit, even though they were several hundred feet underground. Considering that there were trees and grass down here, unlike above the surface, Shinji could get used to living here. Though whether Asuka would agree with him on this remained to be seen.

真嗣不得不承认，于是他开始从背包里拿出烹饪用的东西。他们在湖边上方的一个斜坡上吃午饭，坐在那里可以俯瞰湖面。真嗣不得不承认，尽管他们身处地下几百英尺，但这里确实很美。考虑到这里有树木和草地，与地表不同，真嗣可以习惯在这里生活。不过明日香是否同意他的看法，还有待观察。

After eating, Asuka seemed to have made a decision on there next course, so they set back off along the path. They walked for what felt like another hour until they reached a small outpost set up along a road. It was gated, and had scanners and cameras along the side. Asuka looked into the outpost, but didn't see anything of use. The gate was large, but not large enough that they could jump it. Asuka climbed first and reached the top, allowing Shinji to toss the pack to her so she could drop it over the other side. Shinji then followed her lead, and jumped onto the other side.

饭后，明日香似乎已决定接下来的路线，于是他们沿着小径重新出发。步行了约莫又一个小时，他们抵达了一处沿路设立的小哨站。哨站设有大门，两侧配备了扫描仪和摄像头。明日香仔细观察了哨站，却未发现任何有用的信息。大门虽宽，却不足以让他们跳跃而过。明日香率先攀爬至顶端，示意真嗣将背包抛给她，以便她能将其扔到另一侧。随后，真嗣也效仿她的动作，成功跃至大门另一边。

Asuka told him that even though the power wasn't working, most of the gated entry ways into Nerv had manual overrides that could be used in dire situations. If this wasn't a time to use them, Shinji didn't know what was.

明日香告诉他，尽管电源失效，Nerv 的大部分门禁入口都设有手动应急装置，以备紧急情况使用。如果这都不算紧急时刻，真嗣不知道还有什么算。

Off to the side, just in front of the large metal door that was apparently part of D block was one of these manual overrides. It was a metal door with the word 'emergency access' splashed across it in big red letters. Upon the door was a large hand crank that Asuka tried first, but it took their combined strength to open the door. Shinji guessed that this wasn't something fifteen year olds were supposed to be using.

在旁边，就在那扇显然属于 D 区的大金属门前，有一个这样的手动应急装置。这是一扇金属门，上面用大红字母写着‘紧急出口’。门上有一个大手摇柄，明日香先试了试，但需要他们合力才能打开门。真嗣猜想，这不是十五岁少年应该使用的东西。

Darkness engulfed them again, and Asuka lit the lighter again, giving them a faint ray of light that led them forward. They were in a very narrow hallway now, and were forced to walk single file until they came to another of the emergency access doors. They opened it again and Shinji looked up to the large ceiling that folded out above him.

黑暗再次吞噬了他们，明日香再次点燃打火机，为他们提供了一束微弱的光线，引领他们前行。现在他们身处一条非常狭窄的走廊，只能单列行进，直到他们遇到另一扇紧急出口门。他们再次打开门，真嗣抬头望向那展开在他头顶的巨大天花板。

"This is something like a hub I guess you could call it," said Asuka. "The walk ways usually move on there own, directing people to where they want to go and they branch off in different directions as well. Science labs, research labs, offices, medical facilities, all have there own area. The elevators of course also add to the transportation."

“这有点像一个枢纽，我想你可以这么称呼它，”明日香说道，“通常走道会自行移动，引导人们前往他们想去的地方，并且还会分支出不同的方向。科学实验室、研究实验室、办公室、医疗设施，都有各自的区域。当然，电梯也增加了交通的便利性。”

"How many people actually worked here."

"这里到底有多少人真正工作过。"

"Not sure," said Asuka truthfully. "I only knew a handful of people that worked here, but I'm sure that it took a thousand or so workers just to run this place as well as the Geofront."

“不确定，”明日香如实说道，“我只认识这里工作的少数几个人，但我确信，光是维持这个地方和地底都市的运作，就需要上千名工人。”

It felt weird to think that people were going about there daily lives in a facility this large not even two months ago. Shinji wondered if his father hadn't walked this very same path at one point.

想到不到两个月前，人们还在这样一个庞大的设施中过着日常的生活，真让人感到奇怪。真嗣不禁思索，他的父亲是否也曾走过这条路。

"So where exactly are we going first then?" asked Shinji.

“那么，我们首先去哪里呢？”真嗣问道。

"Ideally, it would be the command center, but reaching it would be difficult. I know there is a ladder that leads there somewhere, though I'm not sure where it would be. Next it would be the Evangelions chamber I guess."

"理想情况下，应该是指挥中心，但到达那里会很困难。我知道某个地方有一架梯子通向那里，虽然我不确定具体位置。接下来，我想应该是 EVA 的机库吧。"

"Aren't those several levels higher than we are though?"

"那些不是比我们所在的位置高出好几层吗？"

"I'm surprise you remembered. Yeah, they are, though I remember well enough how to get there. There was one other thing I figured I'd show you."

"你居然还记得，真让我惊讶。是的，它们确实高几层，不过我清楚记得怎么上去。还有一件事我想带你去看。"

"What?" “什么？”

"The commanders office," said Asuka simply.

"指挥官的办公室," 明日香简单地说道。

Shinji had to do a double take at that, and for a minute he wasn't sure what to say.

这让真嗣不得不再次确认，一时间他不知道该说什么。

"Are you surprised?" asked Asuka.

"你感到惊讶吗？" 明日香问道。

"A little...yeah," replied Shinji slowly. "Why did you to decide to show me that?"

"有点...嗯，" 真嗣缓缓回答，"你为什么要决定给我看那个？"

"I thought that it would be good for you to see where your father spent most of his time."

"我想让你看看你父亲大部分时间待的地方，这对你有好处。"

"You've been there before?"

"你去过那里吗？"

"Once," said Asuka. "When I first came here, my guardian brought me before him."

"曾经，" 明日香说道，"我刚来这里的时候，我的监护人带我去见了他。"

Shinji was still looking at her strangely however, and Asuka could feel her patience running thin.

然而，真嗣仍然奇怪地看着她，明日香能感觉到她的耐心正在耗尽。

"What!?" she snapped at him.

"什么！？" 她冲他吼道。

"No...sorry, still surprised is all that you would consider showing me something like that."

"不...抱歉，我只是还有点惊讶，你居然会考虑给我看那种东西。"

Asuka didn't like his tone, so she retorted angry, "What? You don't want to see it?"

明日香不喜欢他的语气，于是生气地反驳道：“什么？你不想看吗？”

"I do...but thinking about me is strange coming from you I guess."

"我确实...但这种话从你嘴里说出来，感觉挺奇怪的。"

Shinji said these feelings honestly, as it seemed that Asuka rarely did seem to have Shinji's interests on her mind. She normally just said or did whatever she pleased and didn't worry about what he would think. Seeing her considering his thoughts about his father was a bit of a surprise to Shinji.

真嗣坦率地说出了这些感受，因为似乎明日香很少会把真嗣的利益放在心上。她通常只是随心所欲地说或做，并不担心他会怎么想。看到她考虑他对父亲的看法，对真嗣来说有点意外。

Asuka wasn't too pleased by Shinji's response however, because she hit him in the arm and said, "Just because I'm not constantly badgering you about your feelings doesn't mean I don't listen! This place holds significance to you as well, so of course I'd think to show you your fathers office!"

然而，明日香对真嗣的回答并不太满意，因为她打了一下他的手臂，说道：“只是因为我没有一直追问你的感受，并不意味着我没在听！这个地方对你也很重要，所以我当然会想到带你去看你父亲的办公室！”

"Okay, okay," said Shinji, trying to avoid an argument. Even though he had stated his surprise over Asuka's decision to show him where his father worked, he was touched by her consideration in his feelings. He hadn't thought about asking about this in the first place, as it seemed Asuka had her own things she was dealing with, and Shinji didn't want to get in the way of those. He was curious about his fathers work, even though he didn't say anything. So getting to see where he spent most of his time was nice at least.

"好了，好了，" 真嗣说道，试图避免一场争执。尽管他对明日香决定带他去看父亲工作的地方表示了惊讶，但他被她的体贴所感动。他原本没想过要问这件事，因为明日香似乎有自己的事情要处理，真嗣不想妨碍她。他对父亲的工作感到好奇，尽管他没有说出口。所以至少能亲眼看到父亲大部分时间所待的地方，还是不错的。

"Are you coming, or are you going to stand there all day?" asked Asuka who was several paces in front of him. She seemed to be slightly grumpy.

“你来不来，还是打算在那儿站一整天？”明日香在他前方几步远的地方问道，看起来有点儿不高兴。

Shinji hurried forward to walk alongside Asuka and said, "Thank you."

真嗣快步上前，与明日香并肩而行，说道：“谢谢你。”

"Say your thanks after you've seen his office. Its not the most heartwarming."

“等你看了他的办公室再说感谢吧。那地方可不怎么温馨。”

Shinji nodded silently, wondering what she meant by that.

真嗣默默点头，心中疑惑她此言何意。

They followed the walkways for a while in silence, Asuka leading the way. Eventually, they branched off down a hallway, and then another. It was at this point that Asuka called for a stop, as she saw something darkened on the floor.

他们默默地沿着步道走了一会儿，由明日香带路。最终，他们拐进了一条走廊，接着又是一条。就在这时，明日香叫停了，因为她看到地板上有东西变暗了。

"Hold on Shinji," said Asuka as she held the lighter out in front of her, looking at the floor in front of her.

“等等，真嗣，”明日香说着，将打火机伸向前方，盯着她面前的地板。

"What is it?" he asked, not able to see whatever it was she was looking at.

“那是什么？”他问道，看不见她正在看的东西。

Asuka bent down, and ran her finger over the substance. It was impossible to mistaken the color, and even though it had dried, it still had a sickly red look.

明日香弯下腰，用手指轻触那物质。颜色不可能认错，尽管已经干涸，它依然呈现出一种病态的红色。

"Blood," said Asuka heavily.

"血，"明日香沉重地说道。

"Blood?" asked Shinji confused. "What do you mean?"

"血？"真嗣困惑地问，"你是什么意思？"

Asuka stared down at the dark patch of blood, already dried onto the metal floor. It seemed that her suspicions were correct.

明日香盯着那块深色的血迹，已经干涸在金属地板上。看来她的怀疑是正确的。

"Something I didn't tell you about before Shinji. When we came down the first ladder leading from the surface to the Geofront, the last bit was cut by a saw blade of some kind. It was fine when I climbed it originally, but now its broken. I wondered why that would be. After this though, it seems apparent that the government attacked Nerv at some point."

“有件事我之前没告诉过你，真嗣。当我们从地表下到地底都市的第一段梯子时，最后一段是被某种锯片切断的。我最初爬的时候还好好的，但现在断了。我想知道为什么会这样。不过现在看来，很明显政府在某一刻攻击了 NERV。”

"Attacked...what do you-"

"遭到攻击...你对此有何-"

"Think about the vehicles we saw on are way here, as well as the large hole in the Geofront. I'm sure that the angels were part of this, but the military seemed to have been mobilized against Nerv as well."

"想想我们来这里的路上看到的那些车辆，还有地底都市的大洞。我确信天使与此有关，但军方似乎也对 Nerv 采取了行动。"

"Why would they do that?"

"他们为何要这么做？"

"Not everyone in the government agreed with what Nerv did, or believed that the angels were even real. Some of them saw Nerv as a dangerous corporation, and the Evangelions as demons. Though to go this far..."

并非所有政府成员都赞同 Nerv 的所作所为，或者相信天使的存在。有些人视 Nerv 为一个危险的公司，将 EVA 视为恶魔。尽管如此，做到这种地步……

Asuka wondered just how many had died before Third Impact had been initiated.

明日香想知道在第三次冲击启动之前，究竟有多少人丧生。

Shinji now stood beside her and looked at the dark stain on the ground. It was impossible to mistaken it as something else. Even in the light from the lighter, the blood still had a certain sheen to it.

真嗣现在站在她旁边，看着地上的暗色污渍。这不可能被误认为是其他东西。即使在打火机的微弱光线下，那血迹依然泛着某种光泽。

"Lets go," said Asuka, "Theres no point lingering here, and we should be getting close to where the ladder is for the Evangelions."

“走吧，”明日香说道，“在这里逗留毫无意义，我们应该快接近放置 EVA 的梯子了。”

"Okay," mumbled Shinji, taking one last look at the blood before he followed her.

“好吧，”真嗣咕哝着，最后看了一眼血迹，然后跟着她走了。

It didn't take long until Asuka found the ladder that would take them up to the Evangelions floor. This time, Asuka made Shinji go before her, and this time, he was starting to get an idea why. Though in all honesty, what reason did she think he had for looking up at her ass while they were climbing up. It made no sense really.

没过多久，明日香就找到了通往 EVA 机库的梯子。这次，明日香让真嗣先上，而这次，他开始有点明白为什么了。不过说实话，她以为他有什么理由在爬梯子时盯着她的屁股看呢？这根本说不通。

As he reached the top, Shinji waited for Asuka to appear so that he could see. Though he was starting to get used to the lack of light, having the lighter still made a large difference.

当他到达顶端时，真嗣等待着明日香的出现，以便他能看见。虽然他开始习惯了缺乏光线的环境，但打火机的存在仍然带来了巨大的差异。

After Asuka reached the top, she flicked the lighter on and walked around a corner to where the door for the Evangelions were stored. Here, the fighting seemed to be some of the worst, as there was blood spilled across so much of the floor that little of the original whiteness could be seen. Shinji tried not to look down at this, or vomit, so he instead focused on the flame in front of him.

在明日香到达顶端后，她点燃了打火机，绕过一个拐角，来到了存放福音战士的门前。这里，战斗似乎是最为惨烈的，因为地板上洒满了鲜血，几乎看不到原本的白色。真嗣尽量不去看脚下，以免呕吐，所以他转而专注于眼前的火焰。

Though Asuka knew that the door wouldn't open, she still tried pressing her weight against it, hoping that it might have gotten damaged at some point during the fighting. No luck however, as she gave up after the third attempt.

尽管明日香知道门不会打开，她还是试图用体重去推它，希望在战斗中它可能已经受损。然而，没有运气，她在第三次尝试后放弃了。

"What now?" asked Shinji.

“现在怎么办？”真嗣问道。

"Give me a second," said Asuka as she tilted her head slightly.

"给我一点时间," 明日香说着，微微侧了侧头。

She thought for almost a minute, just starring at the door in front of her. It was impossible to break through the door, that much was sure.

她思考了近一分钟，只是盯着面前的门。要破门而入是不可能的，这一点很确定。

"The ventilation duct may work," whispered Asuka as she thought about this.

"通风管道或许可行," 明日香低声说道，同时思考着这个方案。

"Huh?" muttered Shinji. "嗯？" 真嗣咕哝道。

"I think I thought of something," said Asuka as she turned around and started walking back down the hallway they had just come from. Instead of turning right however, where the ladder they had just come, she continued down the hallway and turned left. There was a ventilation duct there with a large quantity of blood slopped around it and even on the walls next to it. Whats more, the cover had already been taken off the duct.

"我想到了点什么，" 明日香说着转过身，开始沿着他们刚走过的走廊往回走。然而，她并没有向右转，那里是他们刚爬下来的梯子所在，而是继续沿着走廊走，然后向左转。那里有一个通风管道，周围洒满了大量血迹，甚至溅到了旁边的墙上。更重要的是，通风管道的盖子已经被移开了。

Getting down on her hands and knees, Asuka looked into the duct with the light before standing up again.

明日香跪下用手和膝盖支撑着身体，用灯光照进管道里查看，然后又站了起来。

"A little small, but it should take us directly over the Evangelions chamber."

"有点小，但它应该能直接带我们飞越 EVA 的机库。"

Shinji was more worried about the blood around the duct though. It was ominous for some reason.

但真嗣更担心通风管周围的血迹。不知为何，这显得很不祥。

"You go first," said Asuka as she held the lighter out for him.

"你先走，"明日香说着，把打火机递给他。"

Shinji took it wordlessly, not bothering to question Asuka's logic, and bent down to start crawling. It was then that it hit him. Something seared into his mind, penetrated it. Something...no somebody. An image? A person? Shinji felt pain suddenly and wanted to cry out. Everything was red, even the persons jacket. What was it? Death was hovering in place. Words were spoken, but Shinji couldn't hear them. He wanted to say something, but his mouth wasn't working. His body wasn't under his control. Blood continued seeping out and pooling next to the body. Shadows appeared, hovering over the body. Words again were spoken; the shadows left. Or did they die too? No...later...later. Shinji couldn't do anything as he watched life disappear. Something else though...another voice? Something familiar it seemed. From the ventilation duct? No, that seemed impossible. Who could be speaking to him from there.

真嗣默默接过，懒得质疑明日香的理由，弯腰开始爬行。就在这时，他突然感到一阵冲击。某种东西烙印在他的脑海，穿透了他的意识。某种...不，某个人。是影像？还是人？真嗣突然感到疼痛，想要呼喊。一切都是红色的，甚至连那人的夹克也是。那是什么？死亡就在那里徘徊。有人说话，但真嗣听不见。他想说些什么，但嘴巴不听使唤。他的身体不受控制。鲜血继续渗出，汇聚在尸体旁。阴影出现，笼罩着尸体。又有人说话；阴影离开了。还是他们也死了？不...稍后...稍后。真嗣无能为力，只能眼睁睁看着生命消逝。但还有别的...另一个声音？似乎很熟悉。从通风管道传来的？不，这似乎不可能。谁会从那里对他说话呢？

Sharp pain jolted him out of the vision. Everything was muffled, but his hearing was starting to come back. What had just happened to him?

剧烈的疼痛将他从幻象中惊醒。一切都是模糊的，但他的听力开始恢复。刚刚发生了什么？

"Oi!? What are you doing? Move the fuck forward!" shouted Asuka from behind Shinji.

“喂！你在干嘛？快他妈往前爬！”明日香在真嗣身后喊道。

"What?" said Shinji, still dazed from whatever had happened.

"什么？" 真嗣说道，仍然对刚才发生的事情感到茫然。

Asuka kicked him again, just as she had done moments ago to wake him.

明日香又踢了他一脚，就像刚才为了叫醒他那样。

"Why are you just kneeling there!? Get moving!"

"你为什么只是跪在那里！？快动起来！"

"Oh...sorry..." said Shinji, still heavily confused.

“哦...抱歉...” 真嗣说道，依旧深陷困惑之中。

"Jeez...what were you doing just sitting there. Dreaming?"

"天哪...你就这么坐在那儿，做梦呢？"

'Maybe I was,' thought Shinji. Though as he looked down at the dried blood that his hand was pressed to, he wasn't entirely sure. Whether what he had really seen had happened right here, he pushed it all to the back of his mind. It wasn't something to dwell on.

“或许我是吧，”真嗣心想。然而，当他低头看着自己手掌所按着的干涸血迹时，他并不完全确定。究竟他所真正目睹的那些是否真的发生在此地，他将其统统抛诸脑后。这不是该深究的事情。

They slowly crawled through the duct, Shinji leading this time until he stopped and spoke to Asuka behind him.

他们缓缓爬过通风管道，这次由真嗣领头，直到他停下并转身对身后的明日香说话。

"I think I reached the end," he said.

“我想我到尽头了，”他说。

"What do you see?" “你看到了什么？”

"Not much really." “没什么特别的。”

"Well look harder then," retorted Asuka angrily.

“那就再仔细看看，”明日香生气地反驳道。

Shinji bit back the retort he wanted to throw, but did what she told him. He perched on the edge of the duct, and peered over, waving the lighter as he did so. The drop actually wasn't that bad, about as much as it had been with the ladder. Without bothering to mention this to Asuka, he dropped right down and out of her sight. Landing on the ground, Shinji turned around just as Asuka looked out of the duct at him. She did not seem happy.

真嗣忍住了想要回嘴的冲动，但还是照她说的做了。他蹲在通风口边缘，探头向下看去，同时挥动着打火机。实际上，这个高度并不算糟糕，和之前用梯子时差不多。真嗣没有向明日香提及这一点，直接跳了下去，消失在她的视线中。落地后，真嗣转过身，正好看到明日香从通风口探出头来看他。她的表情显然不太高兴。

"You could have mentioned you were going to jump you fucking idiot," yelled Asuka.

“你他妈的蠢货，本可以提前说你要跳的！”明日香吼道。

"Worried?" asked Shinji. "担心吗？" 真嗣问道。

It was Asuka's turn to be embarrassed, and she didn't say anything as she jumped down. Landing rather awkwardly on her foot. Shinji had to stifle a grin at that.

轮到明日香感到尴尬了，她什么也没说就跳了下来，落地时脚显得相当笨拙。真嗣不得不忍住笑意。

"Gimme that," said Asuka as she snatched the lighter out of his hand and started walking around.

"给我那个，" 明日香说着从他手中夺过打火机，开始四处走动。

She held the lighter up high, peering around the large chamber. Shinji walked several steps behind her, looking at everything around him. The chamber was quite large. Though as he continued walking, he noticed something-

她高举着打火机，环视着这个巨大的洞穴。真嗣跟在她身后几步远，四处张望着。这个洞穴相当宽敞。然而，随着他继续前行，他注意到了一些东西——

"None of the Evangelions are here," said Shinji as he looked at one of the many empty spaces.

“这里没有一台 EVA，”真嗣看着众多空旷处之一说道。

"As I figured," said Asuka.

“正如我所料，”明日香说道。

"What about Unit 01? I thought you said it didn't have a pilot."

"那零壹号机呢？我记得你说过它没有驾驶员。"

"Not that I knew of at least," said Asuka with a sideways glance at Shinji.

""至少据我所知是没有的，""明日香斜眼瞥了真嗣一眼说道。

"You don't seem surprised that none of them are here?"

"你看起来对它们都不在这里并不感到惊讶？"

"I'm not honestly," said Asuka.

"我真的没有，" 明日香说道。

"Then what was the point of coming here?"

"那我们来这里的意义何在？"

Asuka didn't reply as she looked at an empty spot in the chamber. Shinji walked over to where she stood and looked up the edge. The orange like LCL fluid seemed to fill the entire chamber from the bottom, up to the gangways.

明日香没有回答，只是凝视着室内的一处空地。真嗣走到她身边，抬头望向边缘。橙色的 LCL 液体似乎从底部一直填满了整个房间，直达通道。

"This is where my Evangelion would have stood if it were here," mumbled Asuka.

“如果在这里的话，我的 EVA 原本应该站在这个位置，”明日香喃喃自语。

"Unit 02?" asked Shinji. “二号机？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah," sighed Asuka. “嗯，”明日香叹了口气。

"Is it possible that it is lost in the city somewhere?"

"会不会是遗失在城市的某个角落了？"

"Considering that the Evangelions are larger than most skyscrapers, unlikely. No, it was most likely destroyed somehow."

"考虑到 EVA 比大多数摩天大楼还要大，不太可能。不，它很可能是被某种方式摧毁了。"

Shinji could hear the hurt in Asuka's voice and was reminded again just how much being an Evangelion pilot meant to her.

真嗣能听出明日香声音中的痛苦，这让他再次意识到成为 EVA 驾驶员对她意味着什么。

"How do we get out of here?" asked Shinji.

“我们怎么出去？” 真嗣问道。

"Service ladder over there," said Asuka as she pointed to a far corner. "It should take us to the level directly above your fathers office."

“那边的维修梯，” 明日香指着远处的一个角落说，“应该能带我们到你父亲办公室的上一层。”

Shinji watched her silently for several seconds as she continued looking up at the empty where Unit 02 once stood.

真嗣默默地注视了她几秒钟，她继续抬头望着二号机曾经所在的那片空旷。

"Asuka," he started, "we can stay here longer if you want to..."

"明日香，" 他开口道，"如果你想的话，我们可以在这里多待一会儿..."

"No...thats okay Shinji. Just being here and seeing that its not here is okay. I never had much hope in the first place. Though thanks for the thought."

"不了...这样就好，真嗣。只是在这里，看到它不在，就够了。我本来也没抱太大希望。不过还是谢谢你的心意。"

Asuka turned to him and give him a small smile, before walking away from part of her past life.

明日香转向他，给了他一个浅浅的微笑，然后离开了她过去生活的一部分。

Shinji thought the smile was sad though.

尽管如此，真嗣觉得那微笑带着一丝哀伤。

After they reached the next floor above the Evangelions, Asuka led him down several hallways until they reach a maintenance stairwell that ran parallel alongside the elevator. Following this up several flights of stairs, they came into another hallway that seemed much smaller than others. Walking down it a ways, Asuka eventually stopped at a pair of double doors.

在他们到达初号机所在楼层的上一层后，明日香带着他穿过几条走廊，直到他们到达一个与电梯并行的维修楼梯。沿着这个楼梯爬了几层，他们进入了一条看起来比其他地方小得多的走廊。走了一段路后，明日香最终在一对双开门前停了下来。

"This is it," said Asuka.

“就是这里了。”明日香说道。

Shinji looked at the doors for several seconds before he turned the knob on one of them. It opened easily. As he went to step inside however, he noticed that Asuka was leaning against the wall directly next to the door.

真嗣盯着那扇门看了好几秒，然后才转动其中一扇门的把手。门轻易地开了。然而，当他正要踏进去时，注意到明日香正靠在门旁边的墙上。

"Aren't you going inside?" he asked her.

“你不进去吗？”他问她。

"No, I'll stay here and wait for you. This is more something that I think you should do on your own."

“不，我在这里等你。我觉得这事儿你还是自己去做比较好。”

"Won't it be dark out here though?"

"但这里不会很暗吗？"

"Leave the lighter with me then. You should be able to see fine in there."

"那就把打火机留给我吧。你在里面应该能看得很清楚。"

Shinji was confused by this statement, but he listened to her all the same. Leaving Asuka outside, he walked into his fathers office.

真嗣对这句话感到困惑，但他还是听了她的话。留下明日香在外面，他走进了父亲的办公室。

It wasn't like what he had imagined certainly, but he understood now what Asuka had said that he wouldn't need the lighter. Windows lined the side all along the office, letting in sunlight from the outside. Other than that, almost everything else was pitch black. The carpet, the ceiling, even parts of the wall were black. The only thing in the room was a desk set in the middle of it.

这确实不像他想象中的样子，但他现在明白了明日香所说的他不需要打火机的意思。办公室的一侧排列着窗户，让外面的阳光洒进来。除此之外，几乎所有其他东西都是漆黑的。地毯、天花板，甚至部分墙壁都是黑色。房间里唯一的家具是一张摆在中间的桌子。

Shinji walked over to it and ran his hand over the surface, wondering when last his father had been here. He walked behind and sat down in the chair, looking at everything on the desk. It was remarkably clear of anything except a single piece of paper with what looked like a drawing of an upside down triangle and multiple eyes looking out. Shinji thought about pocketing this briefly, but decided not to.

真嗣走过去，用手抚摸着桌面，想知道他父亲上次来这里是什么时候。他绕到桌子后面坐下，环顾桌上的物品。除了一个看起来像倒三角形和多只眼睛的图画纸外，桌上异常干净。真嗣短暂地考虑过把它放进口袋，但最终决定不这么做。

Setting it back on the table, he tried opening drawers. Most of them were locked except for one that opened. In it was a single photo of a man and a woman. Shinji gazed at this photo for some time until he turned it around and read what was on the back.

把它放回桌上后，他尝试打开抽屉。大部分都上了锁，除了一个能打开的。里面只有一张男女合照。真嗣凝视着这张照片许久，直到他翻过来，读了背面的文字。

"Gendo and Yui," Shinji read aloud.

“源堂和唯，”真嗣大声念道。

Shinji decided to pocket it.

真嗣决定把它放进口袋。

Moments later, he left his fathers office and found Asuka sitting down with her head slumped sideways slightly. Shinji didn't think he spent that much time in there, but it seemed Asuka had fallen asleep during that time. Nudging her gently, she slowly woke up.

片刻后，他离开了父亲的办公室，发现明日香正坐着，头微微歪向一边。真嗣不认为自己在里面待了那么久，但似乎明日香在那段时间里睡着了。他轻轻地推了推她，她慢慢地醒了过来。

"I've seen all I wanted," said Shinji.

“我已经看够了，”真嗣说道。

Rubbing her eyes slowly, Asuka replied, "Okay."

揉着眼睛慢慢醒来，明日香回答道：“好吧。”

Standing up, she yawned widely and flicked the lighter on, and started leading them back down through the headquarters of Nerv.

她站起身，大大地打了个哈欠，点燃打火机，开始带领他们穿过 NERV 总部返回。

As they reached the floor of the Evangelions chamber however, Asuka decided to make a detour.

然而，当他们到达 EVA 机库的楼层时，明日香决定绕个弯。

"Shinji, I think I have one last place I want to stop."

"真嗣，我想还有一个地方我必须去。"

"Okay...what is it?" "好的……是什么地方？"

"Something...thats rather hard to explain I guess. But it goes hand in hand with my Evangelion I guess. So, I think its best if I go there as well.

"那地方……挺难解释的。不过，它和我驾驶的 EVA 有些关联。所以，我觉得我也应该去那里看看。"

"Fine with me," said Shinji with a shrug.

"我没意见。" 真嗣耸了耸肩说。

"Okay, and its not far from here either," said Asuka.

“好的，而且离这儿也不远，”明日香说道。

Leading them passed the door for the Evangelion chamber which wouldn't open, Asuka led them down several more hallways until they reached something which Shinji didn't expect.

带领他们经过无法开启的 EVA 驾驶舱门，明日香又领着他们穿过几条走廊，直到他们来到一个让真嗣意想不到的地方。

"What is this Asuka?" he asked.

“这是什么，明日香？”他问道。

"Where pilots would change into there plug suits of course," said Asuka as if this was fact.

“当然是飞行员换上他们的紧身衣的地方。”明日香如是说，仿佛这是常识。

Shinji could only see a male and female sign hanging above the door which had made him instantly think of a bathroom.

真嗣只能看到门上方挂着的男女性别标志，这让他立刻联想到了洗手间。

Walking into the changing room felt strange, almost as though Shinji was intruding somehow. Asuka with him of course, but he was still remembering that other pilot. Rei was her name he thought Asuka had told him. Though there were many lockers, the only ones that had name tags on them were Asuka's and Rei's.

走进更衣室感觉很奇怪，仿佛真嗣在某种程度上是在侵犯别人的隐私。当然，明日香和他在一起，但他仍然记得那位其他驾驶员。他记得明日香告诉过他，她的名字是绫波。虽然有很多储物柜，但只有明日香和绫波的柜子上贴着名牌。

Shinji watched Asuka as she opened her own locker and looked through at the contents. There wasn't much in there. A few papers for something and three plug suits, all the same that hung in a line.

真嗣看着明日香打开自己的储物柜，查看里面的物品。里面东西不多。几张文件和三件插入栓服，全都一样，整齐地挂成一排。

"So you do like red," said Shinji, trying to make conversation.

“看来你确实喜欢红色。”真嗣试图找话题说道。

Either Asuka didn't hear him or she completely ignored him. She seemed to be gathering herself for something. A mirror hung on the inside door of the locker and Asuka examined her reflection briefly and even seemed to be laughing at it. Shinji knew that he couldn't look much better himself.

要么是明日香没听到他的话，要么就是她完全无视了他。她似乎在为某事做准备。储物柜内侧门上挂着一面镜子，明日香短暂地审视了一下自己的倒影，甚至似乎对着它笑了起来。真嗣知道自己的样子也好不到哪儿去。

Slowly though, Asuka let out a sigh and brought her hand up to her head before she removed the A10 nerve receptors that adorned her hair. The things that she had told Shinji played a significant role in her life, as they signified her position in Nerv, something that she prized above all else. Now though, they were useless in this After Impact world. She slowly placed them in the spot above the plug suits in her locker and then closed if for the final time. Turning around, she started walking away, not looking at Shinji. But he wasn't sure that he could agree with this. Shinji had spoken against them at one point, but that was more because he couldn't understand why she cared about being an Evangelion pilot so much.

然而，明日香缓缓叹了口气，抬起手摸向自己的头，然后取下了装饰在头发上的 A10 神经接收器。这些她曾告诉过真嗣的东西，在她的生活中扮演着重要角色，象征着她在 NERV 中的地位，这是她最为珍视的东西。但现在，在这个后冲击的世界里，它们已经毫无用处。她慢慢地将它们放在储物柜中插槽服上方的位置，然后最后一次关上了柜门。转过身，她开始离开，没有看真嗣一眼。但他不确定自己是否能同意这一点。真嗣曾一度反对过这些，但那更多是因为他不明白她为何如此在意成为 EVA 驾驶员。

"Asuka...is this okay?" "明日香...这样可以吗？"

"...It is," she replied. She didn't seem to want to show any frailty.

"...可以，"她回答道。她似乎不想表现出任何脆弱。"

"Okay," said Shinji, not sure if this was the right thing to say. If he argued enough, she may take them back, but she may get angry at him as well for not siding with her. Either way, Shinji didn't know what he was supposed to say.

“好吧，”真嗣说道，不确定这是否是正确的话。如果他争论得足够多，她可能会收回它们，但她也可能会因为他没有站在她这边而对他生气。无论哪种情况，真嗣都不知道他应该说什么。

Instead he followed her quietly out of the changing room as they began there journey to leave Nerv behind.

相反，他静静地跟着她走出了更衣室，他们开始踏上离开 NERV 的旅程。

They hadn't realized how much time they had spent walking the hallways of Nerv, because as they got out, they realized that the sun was just beginning to set. Seeing this, Shinji suggested that they sleep in the Geofront tonight, as it beat sleeping on asphalt above the surface. Asuka agreed, though rather halfheartedly.

他们没有意识到他们在 NERV 的走廊里走了多久，因为当他们出来时，他们意识到太阳刚刚开始落山。看到这一幕，真嗣建议他们今晚在 Geofront 过夜，因为这比睡在地面上的柏油路上要好。明日香同意了，尽管有些不情愿。

They set up camp next to the lake, and Shinji made do with what rations they had left. He'd probably have to find more on there way back tomorrow. But again, back to what? In all honesty, there really wasn't much left for them back at that old store they had frequented after the rainstorm. They may as well stay here in the Geofront, but Shinji had a feeling Asuka couldn't agree to that. He himself was having a difficult time being here when he thought about the bloodshed that occurred. The thought of that vision surfaced in his mind, but he pushed it to the side again. Even though he had wanted to see his fathers office, it was eerier then he had imagined.

他们在湖边扎营，而真嗣只能将就着用剩下的口粮。明天返回的路上，他大概还得找些补给。但话说回来，回到哪里呢？老实说，那场暴雨后他们常去的老店，剩下的东西真的不多了。他们还不如就留在这地底都市，但真嗣觉得明日香不会同意。一想到这里曾发生过的血腥事件，他自己也难以安心。那个幻象再次浮现在脑海，但他又一次将其推开。尽管他曾想看看父亲的办公室，但那地方比想象中还要阴森。

Setting the sleeping bags next to the fire that Shinji had managed to start with fallen branches around the edges of the forest, Shinji lay down on his own and let his mind wander. What he had seen today was a surprise and he thought about everything that Asuka had told him over the course of the two months or so they had spent together. It was a lot to take it. Everything thing that he had known prior to meeting her was almost completely thrown out to take place by this new world, a world that he may have lived in himself if things hadn't happened the way they had. What would have happened to him then? He would have worked with Asuka and that other pilot, Rei, and they would have fought the angels together. Was it better than what he had before? He didn't know the answer to that, but at least he would have had a purpose at least.

将睡袋安置在真嗣好不容易用森林边缘的枯枝点燃的篝火旁，真嗣躺下，任思绪飘荡。今天所见的一切令他意外，他回想起与明日香这两个月来共度的时光，她告诉他的种种。这一切让他难以消化。遇见她之前他所知的一切几乎都被这个新世界所取代，一个若非命运如此，他本可能身处其中的世界。那么，他会怎样呢？他会与明日香和另一位驾驶员绫波丽并肩作战，共同对抗使徒。这比他之前的生活更好吗？他无从知晓答案，但至少，他会有一个目标。

Sitting up, he looked across the fire to where Asuka's sleeping bag was, but saw that she wasn't sitting at it. Instead, she was several feet away, sitting at the edge of the lake. Standing up, he walked over to where she was.

坐起身来，他望向篝火对面阿斯哈的睡袋处，却发现她并未坐在那里。相反，她离了几英尺远，坐在湖边。他站起身，朝她所在的地方走去。

"Whats up?" he asked in what he hoped was an innocent voice.

"怎么了？" 他用自认为无辜的语气问道。

"Just thinking about stuff," replied Asuka.

"只是在想些事情，" 明日香回答道。

Shinji sat down next to her and looked at the lake as well. The last rays of the sun were casting a warm glow on the lake, turning the already orange color even darker.

真嗣在她旁边坐下，也望向湖面。夕阳的最后一抹余晖在湖面上投下温暖的辉光，使得原本橙色的湖水显得更加深沉。

"We aren't going to stay here, are we?" asked Asuka suddenly.

“我们不会留在这里，对吧？”明日香突然问道。

"No, I don't think so," said Shinji. "I don't think either of us want to stay here."

“不，我不这么认为，”真嗣说，“我想我们俩都不想留在这儿。”

"Did you find anything in your fathers office?" asked Asuka.

“你在你父亲的办公室里找到什么了吗？”明日香问道。

"Yeah," said Shinji. “嗯，”真嗣说。

Digging into his pocket, he pulled out the photo that he had of his mother and father, one of the only pictures he had ever seen of his mother.

他伸手从口袋里掏出那张父母的照片，这是他仅有的几张母亲的照片之一。

"Is that your mother and father when they were young."

"那是你年轻时的父母吗？"

"Yeah, I think so." "嗯，我想是的。"

"Your mother is beautiful," said Asuka.

"你妈妈真漂亮，"明日香说。"

Shinji wasn't sure how he supposed to reply to that, so he didn't.

真嗣不确定该如何回应，所以他保持沉默。

"Where will we go after this?" thought Asuka out loud.

“之后我们去哪儿？”明日香大声地自言自语。

"Not sure," said Shinji. “不确定，”真嗣说。

They sat like that for several minutes, until Asuka stood up and turned to Shinji.

他们就这样坐了几分钟，直到明日香站起来转向真嗣。

"Turn around for a bit Shinji."

“转过去一会儿，真嗣。”

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"I really don't want to go through this again," sighed Asuka.

"我真的不想再经历一次了," 明日香叹息道。

Shinji looked at her for several seconds before Asuka snapped, "Alright fine, I'm gonna swim, so just turn around and look the other way."

真嗣看了她几秒钟，明日香突然说道："好吧好吧，我要去游泳了，你转过身去别看。"

"Isn't it a little cold out for that?" asked Shinji slightly bemused.

"外面这么冷，不太适合游泳吧？" 真嗣略带困惑地问。

"After looking at my reflection, I feel disgusting," retorted Asuka who seemed to be losing her patience.

"看着自己的倒影，我觉得恶心。" 明日香似乎失去了耐心，反驳道。

"If your just going to be swimming, do I really need to turn around?"

"如果你只是去游泳，我真的需要转过身吗？"

Asuka almost laughed. 明日香差点笑出声来。

"Do you want to see me naked that badly?"

"你就那么想看我裸体吗？"

Though it was just teasing, Asuka set a little more than she had intended. This was when Shinji surmised that Asuka wasn't wearing any underwear. When he looked back though, her reactions to certain things made sense. And she had mentioned that the plug suit was a full bodysuit.

虽然这只是开玩笑，但明日香的话比她原本打算的要多一些。这让真嗣推测出明日香没穿内衣。当他回头再看时，她对某些事情的反应变得合理了。而且她之前提到过，插入栓服是全身连体的。

Asuka, now who's face was turning a dull shade of pink, looked as though she would force Shinji to turn around if didn't comply, when Shinji finally obeyed her.

明日香的脸此刻正泛起一层淡淡的粉红，她看起来似乎会强迫真嗣转过身去，直到真嗣最终顺从了她。

'You could have said something earlier if you were uncomfortable,' thought Shinji. He'd have to remember to mention the department store he had gotten there clothes at when they left the Geofront.

'如果你感到不舒服，本可以早点说出来的，' 真嗣心想。他得记住在他们离开地底都市后，提到那家他们买衣服的百货商店。

"And if you turn around to look-" started Asuka.

"如果你转身去看——" 明日香开口道。

"I've heard this enough to know what you'll already say, so just hurry up and swim."

"我已经听过太多遍，知道你会说什么，所以快点游吧。"

Shinji could almost feel Asuka's eyes boring into his back, but instead, he started hearing the shuffling of clothes as she removed them.

真嗣几乎能感觉到明日香目光如炬，直射他的后背，然而，他听到的却是衣物摩擦的声音，她正在脱下它们。

They had both brought their sweatshirts, so Asuka pulled this off first and then removed her shirt, watching Shinji as she did this. She didn't honestly expect him to turn around, but she figured it was better to be safe.

两人都带了运动衫，所以明日香先脱下运动衫，然后是衬衫，一边做着这些一边注视着真嗣。她并不真的指望他会转过身来，但她觉得还是谨慎为妙。

After removing her pants, she waded slowly into the watery LCL fluid, shivering as it touched her body. Though she had told Shinji she wanted to swim, she really just wanted to cleanse herself. LCL fluid wasn't the best for this, but it did the job at least. She washed her hair as best she could without shampoo, and then floated there for a while, letting the water lap at the side of her body. As she looked up, she saw the giant hole in the Geofront. Everything had happened so suddenly that she wasn't sure what to think anymore. One minute she was an Evangelion pilot, and the next second, she was nobody. It was rather depressing, but she had made her decision when she had left the A10 nerve receptors behind.

脱掉裤子后，她缓缓步入那水状的 LCL 液体中，身体接触到液体时微微颤抖。尽管她告诉真嗣她想游泳，但实际上她只是想清洗自己。LCL 液体并非最佳选择，但至少能完成任务。她尽可能在没有洗发水的情况下洗了头发，然后漂浮了一会儿，任由水轻拍她的身体。抬头望去，她看到了地底都市上的巨大空洞。一切发生得如此突然，她已不确定该如何思考。前一刻她还是一位 EVA 驾驶员，下一秒却成了无名之辈。这颇为令人沮丧，但当她留下 A10 神经接点时，她已经做出了决定。

Rolling over in the LCL fluid, she dove downwards, kicking against the water, as she swam forward before surfacing again. It was rather refreshing to be doing this.

在 LCL 溶液中翻滚着，她向下潜去，踢打着水流，向前游动，随后再次浮出水面。这种感觉颇为提神。

After several more minutes of this, she swam back to the shore. She had completely forgotten about Shinji during her time in the water, but he didn't seem to have moved much. He had only gotten closer to the fire, which was okay in her mind.

又过了几分钟，她游回了岸边。在水中的这段时间里，她完全忘记了真嗣的存在，但他似乎也没怎么动。他只是更靠近了火堆，这在她看来没什么问题。

As Shinji heard her footsteps leaving the water, he asked, "Are you done yet?"

当真嗣听到她的脚步声离开水面时，他问道："你游完了吗？"

"With swimming, yes. With changing, no. So stay turned around."

"游泳是结束了，换衣服还没。所以你继续背过身去。"

'Demanding today, aren't we,' thought Shinji, but he continued to stay turned around.

'今天要求真多啊，' 真嗣心想，但他继续保持背对着。

After much shuffling of clothes, Asuka finally gave him the go ahead to turn around. She had her pant legs rolled up almost to her knees, and she was trying to dry her hair out by using her sweatshirt as a towel. She then ran her hand through her hair to straighten it out as best she could. The shirt she was wearing however could be easily seen that darker spots were forming where the water was dripping. Shinji thought he even saw something else, but he tried to forget about this.

在衣服一阵窸窣声后，明日香终于示意他可以转身了。她的裤腿卷起到快接近膝盖，正试图用运动衫当毛巾来擦干头发。随后，她用手梳理头发，尽量把它弄直。然而，她穿的那件衬衫上可以明显看到水滴留下的深色痕迹。真嗣觉得他甚至看到了别的东西，但他努力不去想这些。

"You look different," he suddenly said.

“你看起来不一样了，”他突然说道。

Asuka paused as she was drying her hair and asked, "Oh? In what way?"

明日香一边擦着头发一边停了下来，问道：“哦？怎么个不同法？”

"Not really sure," said Shinji honestly. "Your hair seems a little longer I guess, but other than that..."

“不太确定，”真嗣老实回答，“你的头发好像稍微长了一点吧，除此之外……”

"The nerve receptors held my hair up a little, so thats maybe why. It is getting a little long though," she said a she held a strand of her hair in front of her face.

"“神经感受器把我的头发稍微撑起来了，所以可能是这个原因。不过确实有点长了，”她说着，将一缕头发摆到脸前。”

"Looks fine to me," said Shinji offhandedly.

"看起来不错啊," 真嗣随口说道。

"Oh?" mumbled Asuka. She didn't say anything other than that however.

"哦？" 明日香咕哝了一声。但她没有再说别的。

Moving out of her way, Shinji walked around the other side of the fire to his sleeping bag and sat down. Asuka did the same across from him.

真嗣从她身边走开，绕到火堆的另一边，坐在自己的睡袋旁。明日香也在他对面坐下。

"How do you feel?" asked Shinji

"你感觉怎么样？" 真嗣问道

"After swimming. A lot better."

"游完泳后，感觉好多了。"

"I didn't mean that...you said before that those things you wore in your head meant a lot to you, more then I could understand. Why did you leave them behind?"

“我不是那个意思……你之前说过，你头上戴的那些东西对你意义重大，远超我能理解的程度。为什么你要把它们留下？”

"It was time for me to move on." said Asuka after a short pause.

"是时候该我继续前进了。" 明日香短暂停顿后说道。

"Is that okay though?" "这样真的好吗？"

"You already asked me that Shinji, and I told you, its fine. The past is just that, the past. Everything before now doesn't matter. Whatever I was before now, it doesn't matter."

"你已经问过我这个问题了，真嗣，我告诉过你，没问题的。过去就是过去，现在之前的一切都不重要。无论我以前是什么样，现在都不重要了。"

"Yes it does," said Shinji rather adamantly. "It does matter, because it is still a part of your life, even if that life is in the past. While I don't have a problem with you leaving those A10 things at Nerv, I don't think you should completely forget about your past at Nerv. Everybody that you met at Nerv, they were important people."

"是的，确实如此，" 真嗣相当坚定地说道，"这很重要，因为即便那段生活已成为过去，它依然是构成你生命的一部分。虽然我不介意你把那些 A10 的东西留在 NERV，但我认为你不应该完全忘记在 NERV 的过去。你在 NERV 遇到的每一个人，他们都是重要的人。

"And you're one to lecture me about ignoring my past?"

"你倒是教训起我来了，自己不也忽视了过去吗？"

"I'm not a good example, true, but its not just that. Its too sad to see you ignore everything about your prior life. Now is the most important certainly, but don't throw everything away before now either, because thats what has made you who you are in the present."

“我确实不是个好榜样，但这不只是重点。看到你完全忽视过去的一切，实在太令人难过了。当然，现在是最重要的，但也不要把之前的全部抛弃，因为正是那些过往造就了现在的你。”

Shinji calmly finished, leaving Asuka rather silent. He hoped that she wouldn't see his worry as pity, but as something more caring. He cared about her, and maybe that was partially for himself, but he still did.

碇真嗣平静地说完，让明日香陷入了沉默。他希望她不会将自己的担忧视为怜悯，而是看作一种更深切的关怀。他关心她，也许这其中也有一部分是为了自己，但他确实如此。

"You say to much," said Asuka eventually.

"你说的太多了，" 明日香最终说道。

"Asuka-" started Shinji. "明日香——" 真嗣开口道。

"No...forget it Shinji. I've heard enough for one day."

"不……算了，真嗣。我今天听得够多了。"

After that, Asuka turned around, facing away from him and tried to fall asleep.

之后，明日香转过身去，背对着他，试图入睡。

'She just doesn't want to face the truth,' thought Shinji as he looked at her back. Though as she had said, he wasn't one to talk.

'她只是不想面对现实，'真嗣看着她的背影心想。尽管正如她所说，他也没资格说别人。

Laying down, Shinji tried to force himself to fall asleep, but it was a long while before he finally managed. Meanwhile, across the fire from him, Asuka was having an equally hard time. Shinji spoke more of the truth than what Asuka had wanted to acknowledge herself. She couldn't fault him for that, as she knew by now that he usually spoke whatever was on his mind.

躺下后，真嗣努力让自己入睡，但过了很久才终于成功。与此同时，在火堆对面的明日香也同样难以入眠。真嗣说出的真相比明日香愿意承认的更多。她不能因此责怪他，因为她现在知道他通常是想到什么就说什么。

A lot had changed for Asuka since she had woken up with a stranger sitting next to her. Though she had to admit, she wasn't sure where she'd be if not for Shinji. The thought of that puzzled her for a brief instance, but she ignored it for now. The last thing she needed was for Shinji to hear her say something like that.

自从醒来发现一个陌生人坐在旁边后，明日香的生活发生了许多变化。尽管她不得不承认，如果不是因为真嗣，她不确定自己会在哪里。这个念头让她短暂地困惑了一下，但她现在选择忽略它。她最不需要的就是让真嗣听到她说这样的话。

Rolling into a more comfortable position, Asuka fell asleep dreaming that she was back inside the comfort of Evangelion Unit 02, but for some reason Unit 01 was there with her.

明日香翻了个身，找到一个更舒适的姿势，然后睡着了，梦见自己回到了二号机的舒适怀抱中，但不知为何，初号机也在那里与她同在。

So I had a lot of fun working on this chapter, largely because we get to see Nerv again, though in very minuscule detail. And of course Shinji's visions are starting to come back again, so expect more with that in the future.

所以我在做这个chapter时玩得很开心，主要是因为我们又能看到 Nerv 了，尽管只是非常细微的细节。当然，真嗣的幻觉又开始回来了，所以未来这方面会有更多内容。

On another note, the birthday themed story that I mentioned during the previous chapter, the first chapter for that will be coming out on the first of march (so friday, I got a lot of work ahead of me) and go all the way to the tenth. It will be mature and expect chapters daily. Tentative story title is Birthday Without Surprises, though that could still possibly change.

另外，之前在chapter中提到的生日主题故事，第一个chapter将在 3 月 1 日（也就是周五，我还有很多工作要做）发布，一直持续到 10 号。这将是一部成熟的作品，预计每天更新一章。暂定故事标题为《没有惊喜的生日》，不过这个标题仍有可能变动。

### Chapter 8: Forward

...And I'm Back! Wow what a wait. Sorry about that everybody. So I guess I should address a few things. Obviously I'm still writing with this chapter coming out and all, and I do plan on working on Birthday Without Surprises in the future (not sure when though). Right now I'm working on my own career outside of fanfiction, so that takes precedence and the reason that I've been absent for so long. I'm sure we'll see more chapters to come though this summer, so look forward to that.

……我又回来了！哇，等了这么久。很抱歉让大家久等了。我想我应该说几件事。显然，我还在继续写作，这部《chapter》出来了，我确实计划将来继续写《生日无惊喜》（虽然不确定什么时候）。现在我在忙自己的职业，这优先级更高，也是我长时间缺席的原因。我相信今年夏天我们会看到更多章节，敬请期待。

---

The sun was high in the sky when Shinji first woke up that next day. Taking several seconds to look around at his surroundings, he remembered the journey which had taken them here, to Nerv. Looking over at Asuka, he saw that she was still sleeping peacefully in her sleeping bag. Shinji watched her peaceful face for several seconds, surprised at how cute she seemed. Of course, that would all disappear the moment she woke up, and Shinji didn't feel like waking her right now.

那天早上，当真嗣第一次醒来时，太阳已经高挂在天空。他花了好几秒钟环顾四周，想起了带他们来到这里的旅程，来到了 NERV。他转头看向明日香，发现她还在睡袋里安稳地睡着。真嗣凝视了她平静的脸庞几秒钟，惊讶于她看起来多么可爱。当然，一旦她醒来，这一切都会消失，而真嗣现在并不想叫醒她。

Rolling out of his sleeping bag, Shinji stood up and walked to the edge of the lake that they had decided to sleep beside. He looked up towards the gaping hole in the Geofront, shielding his eyes from the sun as he did so. He wanted to think, think about what they were going to do next. No matter where they went, he didn't find it possible to meet any other humans around, that seemed a given right now. Instead, simply surviving seemed the only current thing left for them to do. But even that seemed almost pointless.

从睡袋中滚出来，真嗣站起身，走向他们决定在旁边过夜的湖边。他抬头望向地底都市上方的巨大裂口，用手遮挡阳光。他想思考，思考他们接下来该做什么。无论他们去哪里，他都觉得不太可能遇到其他人类，这似乎是当前的必然。相反，生存似乎成了他们唯一能做的事情。但即便如此，这似乎也毫无意义。

'I need to clear my mind,' thought Shinji.

“我需要清理思绪，”真嗣心想。

Stripping down to his underwear, Shinji waded out into the water just as Asuka had done the previous night and started treading water. He didn't do this as a means to get clean though, he just wanted to forget about things for a while. Everything he had seen at Nerv was weighing on his mind.

脱到只剩内裤，真嗣像前一晚的明日香一样涉水进入湖中，开始踩水。他这么做并非为了清洁，只是想暂时忘却烦恼。NERV 发生的一切正沉重地压在他的心头。

Swimming further out into the lake, Shinji was surprised that he didn't have any problems maintaing his stamina. The few times that he had swam in his life he had never been very fast and found that he tired out easily.

继续向湖心游去，真嗣惊讶地发现自己维持体力毫无困难。他一生中虽有几次游泳经历，但从未快过，而且很容易感到疲惫。

'Again with this?' thought Shinji as he paused in mid-stroke, floating there in the water.

'又是这样？'真嗣在划水时突然停下，悬浮在水中思索着。

He had noticed things like this recently, but hadn't wondered about it much. When he had all but ran back to the beach to find Asuka near death, he had hardly bothered to rest. He almost found that he didn't even have to. Then there was his many walks through Tokyo-3 looking for supplies. Not once did he feel tired, or have to catch his breath. It was a strange feeling certainly, one that he wasn't used to.

他最近注意到了这些现象，但并未深究。当他几乎跑回海滩发现濒死的明日香时，几乎没有休息。他几乎感觉自己不需要休息。还有他在第三新东京市寻找补给的多次徒步。他从未感到疲倦，也不需要喘口气。这确实是一种奇怪的感觉，是他不习惯的。

Why didn't his stamina run out? It wasn't as though he was athletic, and Asuka certainly seemed more able then he was, yet he didn't have any problems.

为什么他的体力没有耗尽？他并非运动健将，而明日香显然比他更能干，但他却没有任何问题。

Was it possible that because of Third Impact, something within him changed?

难道是因为第三次冲击，他体内发生了某种变化吗？

'Thats stupid,' he told himself. 'I'm just purposefully applying myself is all now.'

"“这太蠢了，”他自言自语道，“我只是现在更加刻意地努力罢了。”

'What was that vision then?' asked a voice from the far corners of his mind.

“那是什么幻象？”一个声音从他心灵的遥远角落问道。

He had tried blocking that out, tried to the best of his ability, but it surfaced again. Whatever he told himself, you couldn't have called that normal. It was almost like he was really there, almost as though he was able to smell the blood. Everything flashed by so quickly though that he wasn't able to make anything out. And then there had been something else, a voice it seemed like. But that had simply been Asuka's voice calling him back to reality.

他曾试图屏蔽这一切，尽其所能，但它再次浮现。无论他如何自我安慰，这绝非正常。那感觉几乎就像他真的身临其境，几乎能嗅到血腥味。然而一切闪现得太快，他无法辨认任何细节。随后似乎还有别的什么，像是另一个声音。但那不过是明日香的声音，将他唤回现实。

It didn't make any sense, and he was afraid of telling this vision to Asuka, in the fear that she would question his sanity. He certainly felt like he was questioning it himself.

这毫无逻辑，他害怕将这个幻象告诉明日香，担心她会质疑他的心智。他自己也确实感到心智在动摇。

Was it possible that he could see something like that again though? It seemed like the catalyst had been the dried blood that he had passed over as he crawled into the vent, but there had been plenty more blood besides just that spot. It had to have been something else then.

然而，他还有可能再次看到那样的景象吗？似乎催化剂是他爬进通风口时忽略的那块干血，但除此之外还有更多的血迹。那么，一定是其他什么东西了。

Shinji lay there floating in the water, looking up towards the sky as he tried thinking about this, but he just started to get more confused. No matter what, he couldn't think of anything else. He even tried conjuring up images of that spot in his mind, hoping that it might trigger something, but again nothing happened. It was then that he heard a loud shout coming from the shoreline.

真嗣漂浮在水面上，仰望着天空，试图思考这个问题，但他只是越来越困惑。无论怎样，他都无法想到其他任何事情。他甚至试图在脑海中描绘那个场景，希望这能触发些什么，但依然什么都没有发生。就在这时，他听到岸边传来一声大喊。

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING WAY OUT THERE IDIOT?"

“你这个白痴，在那边干什么呢？”

Shinji spluttered as he heard a shout from the shore, and for a second, he swallowed a large amount of water as he tried to gain his wits again. Realizing that he had drifted out farther from the shore than he had intended, Shinji saw that Asuka was awake and standing on the shore, yelling at him.

真嗣听到岸边传来一声喊叫，一时慌乱，不小心吞了一大口水，试图恢复镇定。他意识到自己漂得比预想的更远离岸边，只见明日香已经醒来，站在岸上，正朝他大喊。

"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU WAY OUT THERE?"

"你他妈的为什么跑那么远？"

"I wish she would have stayed asleep," mumbled Shinji. As he said this, he remembered her peaceful face from earlier, but shook this thought away. It was best to not be thinking that when he encountered an angry Asuka.

"我希望她能一直睡着，" 真嗣咕哝着。说到这里，他想起了她之前平静的面容，但又摇了摇头，甩开了这个念头。在遇到生气的明日香时，最好不要想这些。

Without bothering to reply, Shinji started to swim back to the shoreline, taking as much time as he pleased. As Asuka slowly started coming into view though, he saw that her hair seemed to be crackling with electricity. She was not pleased.

真嗣没有费心回答，开始悠闲地游回岸边，尽可能地拖延时间。然而，当明日香慢慢进入视线时，他看到她的头发似乎在噼啪作响，带着电光。她很不高兴。

"What were you doing out there idiot!?" she said as they came within earshot of each other that didn't require shouting.

"你刚才在那儿干什么，白痴！？" 当他们彼此接近到无需大声喊叫就能听清的距离时，她开口说道。

"Swimming obviously," said Shinji as he felt his feet hit solid ground.

“当然是游泳了，”真嗣说着，感觉到双脚触到了坚实的地面。

"What if you had drowned you damn idiot!?"

“要是你淹死了怎么办，你这个大笨蛋！？”

"What would you have done if I had?" asked Shinji.

“如果我真的淹死了，你会怎么办？”真嗣问道。

"What would I have done? I couldn't have done anything you fucking moron! Do you have any idea how long it would take me to-"

"我能做什么？我什么也做不了，你这个该死的白痴！你知道我得花多长时间才能——"

Asuka froze mid sentence though as Shinji's body started to emerge out of the water. It was at this point that she held her hand up and nearly shouted-

但就在这时，随着真嗣的身体从水中浮现，明日香的话语戛然而止。她举起手，几乎要大喊——

"Stop there!" "停下！"

"What?" said Shinji as he almost tripped over his own feet in surprise.

"什么？" 真嗣惊讶得差点绊倒自己。

Asuka's face turned maroon as she stumbled over her next question.

明日香的脸涨得通红，她结结巴巴地问出了下一个问题。

"A-Are you wearing...a-anything?"

"你...你穿...穿了什么吗？"

Shinji paused as she said this, unsure how he was supposed to reply.

听到这话，真嗣顿了顿，不确定该如何回应。

"...Underwear..." he said eventually, feeling his own face start to redden.

"...内裤..." 他最终说道，感到自己的脸也开始泛红。

They stood like that for a while, Shinji half submerged in the water, and Asuka standing at the edge of the water.

他们就这样站了一会儿，真嗣半身浸在水中，而明日香站在水边。

"Am I allowed to get out, or do I need permission?" asked Shinji.

“我可以出来吗，还是需要得到许可？”真嗣问道。

"Do whatever you please," said Asuka as she whipped around, but she still didn't budge from her spot. It seemed that she hadn't finished berating Shinji.

“随你高兴，”明日香转过身来说道，但她仍然没有离开原地。看来她对真嗣的训斥还没结束。

Walking out of the water, Shinji grabbed his clothes which were only several steps beside Asuka and started dressing herself.

走出水面，真嗣抓起仅几步之遥阿斯娜身旁的衣服，开始自己穿上。

"So why were you out in the middle of the lake?" asked Asuka again.

“那你为什么跑到湖中央去了？”阿斯娜再次问道。

"Thinking," said Shinji, "Or trying not to, and then I eventually did anyway."

“思考，”真嗣说，“或者说试图不去想，但最终还是想了。”

"Still, you didn't have to go all the way out there."

"不过，你没必要跑到那么远的地方去。"

"I didn't realize how far away I was."

"我没意识到自己走了那么远。"

"I'm amazed that you were even able to make it back."

"你能回来真是让我惊讶。"

'And I'm still not tired,' thought Shinji as he buttoned his pants.

“我还是不累，”真嗣一边想着，一边扣上裤子。

"So...what are we going to do now...or wasn't that what you were thinking out there for?" asked Asuka.

“那么……我们现在要做什么……还是说你在外面的时候没想过这个问题？”明日香问道。

"Surviving seems to be the only thing we can do right now honestly."

“老实说，目前我们似乎只能尽力生存下去。”

"Thats obvious," scoffed Asuka. "And can I turn around now?"

“这很明显，”明日香嗤之以鼻，“我现在可以转身了吗？”

"Yeah, its fine," said Shinji.

“嗯，没事，”真嗣说道。

Though apparently to Asuka, it wasn't.

尽管对明日香来说，显然并非如此。

Shinji was in the process of button his shirt, the sleeves rolled up as he did, exposing his chest and stomach for Asuka.

真嗣正在扣衬衫的扣子，袖子卷起，露出了他的胸膛和腹部给明日香看。

"I thought you said it was safe!" she said just as she turned around away from him, her face bright red. She longed to hit him, but she couldn't bear to be embarrassed again. Something had caught her eye as she had turned around however, something which had surprised her slightly.

"我以为你说这里很安全！" 她转过身背对他时说道，脸颊通红。她很想揍他一顿，但又害怕再次感到尴尬。然而，当她转身时，有什么东西吸引了她的注意，这让她稍感惊讶。

Turning her head slowly around, she glanced at Shinji who was busy buttoning the last of his buttons. Focusing her gaze though, she saw what had initially caught her eye. Without saying anything, she forcefully grabbed one of Shinji's arms and tugged him towards her.

她缓缓转过头，瞥见真嗣正在忙着扣上最后一颗扣子。但她的目光聚焦之处，是她最初注意到的东西。她一言不发，用力抓住真嗣的一只手臂，将他拉向自己。

"Asuka what are you-" "明日香，你这是要-"

Asuka looked at Shinji's arm almost gazing at it before she directed her eyes back to him.

明日香盯着真嗣的手臂，几乎是在凝视，随后才将目光转回他身上。

"Those scars," she mumbled.

“那些伤疤，”她低声说道。

Shinji looked back at her puzzled, oblivious of how close there faces where.

真嗣困惑地回望她，没意识到两人的脸靠得有多近。

"What scars?" he asked. “什么伤疤？”他问道。

Asuka blinked back at him, amazed that he couldn't have noticed, or did he not want to remember. Was it something that had happened to him when he had been a kid?

明日香眨眼回望着他，惊讶于他竟然没有注意到，或者他不想记住。这是他小时候发生过的事情吗？

"These," said Asuka as she held his arm in front of her face. "You're telling me you never noticed them before?"

“这些，”明日香说着，将他的手臂举到自己面前。“你告诉我你以前从未注意到它们？”

Shinji looked at them, surprised that she was right. He had never noticed, probably because it had been his own arm, but there were definitely white scars adorning his arm, some of which were rather large. But he couldn't ever remember something like that happening.

真嗣看着它们，惊讶地发现她是对的。他从未注意到，可能是因为那是他自己的手臂，但他的手臂上确实布满了白色的疤痕，其中一些还相当大。但他完全不记得发生过这样的事情。

"Don't tell me you somehow got these and simply ignored telling me about them."

"别告诉我你不知怎么弄到了这些，却一直瞒着我。"

"When would I have gotten them?"

"我什么时候能拿到它们？"

"I don't know...during your travels into the city or...when you left," mumbled Asuka.

"我不知道...在你进城旅行的时候，或者...你离开的时候，" 明日香嘟囔道。

Shinji didn't need reminding of this, as he felt like shit every time it was brought up.

每次提起这事，真嗣都觉得自己糟透了，根本不需要别人提醒。

"No, I would have come back dripping in blood if that were true," said Shinji.

“不，如果那样的话，我回来时早就浑身是血了。”真嗣说道。

"I guess you have a point," replied Asuka. "Where then...when you were a kid?"

“我想你说的有道理，”明日香回答，“那是在你小时候吗？”

"Nothing that I can remember," said Shinji as he shook his head, "And anyways, why are you so interested?"

“我记不得有什么特别的，” 真嗣摇着头说，“再说，你为什么这么感兴趣？”

"I," started Asuka, but she wasn't sure how to finish her sentence.

"我，" 明日香开口说道，但她不确定如何结束这句话。

"Just that...you don't seem like the kind of person that would have scars."

"只是...你看起来不像是那种会有伤疤的人。"

Letting go of Shinji's hand, Asuka took a step away from him and said, "Sorry...but those scars...they looked painful...so I wasn't sure if...you had been through something and just didn't tell me.

放开真嗣的手，明日香后退一步说道，"对不起...但那些伤疤...看起来很疼...所以我不知道...你是否经历了什么，只是没告诉我。

"I don't even know where they came from myself," said Shinji as he unrolled his sleeves. Seeing that Asuka was still looking kinda remorseful, Shinji sighed and said, "Don't let it bother you. I can't even remember it. Maybe it was something that happened during the time between Third Impact and when I awoke. Either way it doesn't really matter."

"我自己都不清楚它们从哪儿来的。" 真嗣边说边卷起袖子。看到明日香仍有些懊悔的样子，真嗣叹了口气，安慰道："别放在心上。我连这都记不清了。可能是第三次冲击到我醒来之间发生的事吧。反正也没那么重要。"

Though he said this to Asuka in hopes that it would calm her down, he did wonder about the scars. Looking down at his arm, it was easy to tell that they weren't normal by any means. Judging by the sheer size of them, it looked as though his arm should have been cut off.

尽管他对明日香说这话是希望能让她的情绪平复下来，但他确实对那些伤疤感到好奇。低头看着自己的手臂，很容易看出这些伤疤绝不寻常。从它们的尺寸来看，仿佛他的手臂本该被切断一般。

"Hungry?" asked Shinji, trying to steer the conversation in a different direction.

“饿了？” 真嗣问道，试图将话题引向别处。

"What do you think?" replied Asuka as she started walking towards their makeshift camp.

"你觉得呢？" 明日香回答着，开始向他们的临时营地走去。

Shinji followed her, trying to ignore the scars for now and started pulling out the remaining cans of food that they had. Putting together a meager breakfast, they ate it on there respective sleeping bags. Finishing, Shinji placed the pot beside him and looked into the fire he had lit for breakfast.

真嗣跟着她，暂时不去理会那些伤疤，开始拿出剩下的罐头食品。他们凑合着做了一顿简单的早餐，各自在睡袋上吃了起来。吃完后，真嗣把锅放在旁边，看着他为了早餐点燃的火堆。

"Now what?" he asked as he looked over in Asuka's direction.

"接下来怎么办？" 他问道，目光转向明日香的方向。

She was laying down on her sleeping bag and looked up towards the Geofront, her eyes closed. Taking several seconds to reply, she eventually turned towards him and said-

她躺在睡袋里，眼睛闭着，抬头望向地底都市，过了几秒钟才转向他，说道——

"For now, we should just leave the Geofront I suppose. Afterwards though...well, we can worry about that later I suppose."

“目前，我们还是离开地底都市吧。至于之后的事……嗯，到时候再担心也不迟。”

Standing up, she started rolling up her sleeping bag and placed it in her backpack. Shinji did likewise, packing everything that he had brought in his own.

她站起身来，开始卷起睡袋，放进背包里。真嗣也照做，把自己的东西都收拾好。

"Ready?" asked Asuka. “准备好了吗？”明日香问道。

Shinji nodded, taking one last look at the Geofront before they left.

真嗣点点头，在离开前最后看了一眼地底都市。

They didn't talk much as they made there way to the surface. Briefly, they had to coordinate as they reached the ladder with the missing bars at the bottom. Asuka took several minutes until she decided on what to do, and when she turned towards Shinji, he could tell that she was already rethinking her decision. It seemed to be the only option though.

他们在前往地面的路上没怎么说话。当他们到达底部缺少栏杆的梯子时，不得不短暂协调一下。明日香花了好几分钟才决定怎么做，而当她转向真嗣时，他看得出她已经在重新考虑她的决定了。尽管如此，这似乎是唯一的选择。

Asuka herself could take a running start at the wall and jump the rest of the way up to grab onto the nearest bar, but the problem was Shinji. Setting aside her pack for now, Asuka walked over to the wall and stood against the wall with her back pressed against it, her hands held out in front of her and entwined together.

明日香自己可以先助跑一段，然后跳起来抓住最近的横杆，但问题在于真嗣。暂时放下背包，明日香走到墙边，背紧贴着墙站立，双手向前伸出并交缠在一起。

"I really don't want anything to happen, so don't fuck this up," she said.

“我真的不希望出任何事，所以别搞砸了，”她说。

"Right," said Shinji. “好的，”真嗣说。

Placing his foot into Asuka's entwined hands, she boosted him up, allowing him to grab onto the bar and pull himself the rest of the way up. Throwing her pack up towards him now, Shinji caught it and climbed up several feet, giving Asuka enough room to go behind him. Looking down, he lit the lighter, giving Asuka enough light to see what she was doing. In a flash, he saw her run at the wall, and jump, pressing her foot against the wall springing upwards, almost like a trampoline. She grabbed onto the bottom most bar and pulled herself upward.

他将脚放入明日香交缠的双手中，她将他向上推，让他能够抓住横杆并把自己拉上去。她将背包扔向他，真嗣接住后爬了几英尺，给明日香腾出空间。他低头看去，点燃打火机，为明日香提供足够的光线看清她的动作。一瞬间，他看到她冲向墙壁，跳起，用脚抵住墙壁弹跳起来，就像在蹦床上一样。她抓住最下面的横杆，把自己拉了上去。

"Why do you look so surprised?" asked Asuka as she looked up at him.

“你怎么看起来这么惊讶？”明日香抬头看着他问道。

Shinji had his mouth open apparently, surprised that she could do something like that in one go.

真嗣显然是张大了嘴巴，惊讶于她能一气呵成地做出那种事。

"Do I really need to say?"

“我真的需要说吗？”

"Forget it," said Asuka, "just pass down my pack and get moving. I'm sick of this darkness already."

“算了，”明日香说，“把我的背包递下来，然后我们赶紧走。我已经受够这黑暗了。”

Shinji did so, and then started climbing to the surface. The journey upwards was quicker than before, and Shinji and Asuka found themselves reaching the surface before long. Leaving the shop where the entrance to the Geofront was, they walked into the sunlight and set their packs down, taking a break.

真嗣照做了，随后开始向地面攀爬。这次向上的旅程比之前快了许多，不久后，真嗣和明日香便抵达了地面。他们离开通往地底都市的店铺，走进阳光下，放下背包，稍作休息。

Asuka leaned against the side of the building where the shade was plentiful. Shinji however was standing in the middle of the road and looking towards the hills of Tokyo-3. The city didn't have much to offer them except food and water, and even that had its limits he supposed. Whether they liked it or not, he felt that eventually they would be forced to leave the city behind. Where would they go though?

明日香靠在建筑物的阴凉一侧。而真嗣则站在路中央，眺望着东京-3 的丘陵。这座城市除了食物和水，并没有太多能提供给他们的东西，即便这些也有限度，他想。无论他们是否愿意，他觉得最终他们可能会被迫离开这座城市。但他们又能去哪儿呢？

"Hey Asuka?" Shinji asked.

“嘿，明日香？”真嗣问道。

"What is it?" “什么事？”

"How would you feel about leaving Tokyo-3?"

"你觉得离开第三新东京市怎么样？"

Asuka who had been midway to taking a sip out of her bottle, lowered it from her lips and looked over at Shinji.

正在从瓶中啜饮的明日香，将瓶子从唇边放下，转头看向真嗣。

"Yes...it does seem to make the most sense."

"是的...这似乎是最合理的做法。"

"So you were thinking that as well?"

"所以你也是这么想的？"

"Sorta," said Asuka as she shrugged. "Staying here doesn't do anything for me, and I'm sick of it here honestly. Do you have an idea though?"

"算是吧，" 明日香耸了耸肩说。"留在这里对我没有任何帮助，老实说我在这里已经受够了。不过，你有什么主意吗？"

"I was thinking Tokyo-2 for now, just wondering if the damage was as bad there as it is here."

"我目前考虑去东京-2，只是想知道那里的损坏程度是否和这里一样严重。"

"Third Impact originated here," said Asuka, "but I don't think any city is entirely safe either. Its worth a shot I suppose. Do you know how to get there though, because I wasn't here long before all this don't forget."

"第三次冲击就是在这里发生的，" 明日香说道，"但我觉得没有哪个城市是完全安全的。试试看吧，我想。不过，你知道怎么去那里吗？别忘了，我在这里没待多久就发生了这一切。"

"I was in Tokyo-2 before I came here, I rode by taxi, so I think I should be able to figure out the route well enough. Without a car though, walking could take a while. You don't happen to know how to drive, do you?"

"我来这里之前在东京-2 待过，我是坐出租车去的，所以我想我应该能弄清楚路线。不过没有车的话，步行可能会花很长时间。你恰好会开车吗？"

"How hard could it be? I was an Evangelion pilot after all." said Asuka.

"这能有多难？我毕竟是个 EVA 驾驶员。" 明日香说道。

Shinji didn't miss the hint of superiority in her voice as Asuka said this.

真嗣没有错过她说这话时声音中流露出的优越感。

"Then hopefully there won't be a problem, though first we should stock up on supplies."

"那希望不会有问题，不过首先我们得备足物资。"

"Do you know of any place close by?"

“你知道附近有什么地方吗？”

"On our way here, I think I saw a shopping center of some kind."

"在我们来这里的路上，我想我看到了一个购物中心之类的地方。"

"Then why didn't you say anything?"

"那你为什么不早说？"

"Because you were in such a hurry. Afterwards we should get more clothes as well I think. I can't imagine you're happy sleeping and living in the same clothes every day, and I could use a change as well."

"因为你当时那么匆忙。之后我们也应该买些新衣服，我觉得。我无法想象你每天穿着同样的衣服睡觉和生活会开心，我也需要换换风格。"

Shinji hoped that Asuka would get some underwear as well, and the look she was even giving him seemed to suggest that she was remembering the incident from yesterday.

真嗣希望明日香也能买些内衣，她看他的眼神似乎表明她还记得昨天的事。

"Okay...clothes as well, but we aren't going to be able to carry all this stuff with just our backpacks."

“好吧……还有衣服，但我们光靠背包是拿不了这么多东西的。”

"Which is why we should try to find a car soon. Any that has the keys in the ignition will be fine."

“所以我们应该尽快找辆车。只要是钥匙在点火器上的就行。”

"Alright," replied Asuka.

“好吧，”明日香回答道。

For once, Shinji felt like he had a goal in mind for the first in a while. It was something that he could work for, that they could work towards. It was better than wandering around Tokyo-3 at least.

这一次，真嗣感觉自己终于有了一个目标，一个他可以为之努力、他们可以共同追求的目标。这总比在第三新东京市漫无目的地闲逛要好得多。

Picking up their packs, Shinji started back tracking the way they had gone, looking for the store they had passed yesterday. It didn't stand out by any means, but Shinji remembered that it seemed like a small shopping center. They checked each of the cars that they passed on there way, but with no luck. Sometimes they were lucky to even find a car that hadn't been crushed by fallen debris.

提起背包，真嗣开始沿着他们走过的路往回走，寻找昨天经过的那家商店。它并不显眼，但真嗣记得那似乎是个小型购物中心。他们逐一检查沿途经过的车辆，却一无所获。有时能找到一辆未被坠落碎片压坏的车已是幸运。

Just when Shinji was starting to second guess his decision about which direction the shopping center was in, he rounded the block and spotted it.

就在真嗣开始怀疑自己对购物中心方向的判断时，他绕过街角，一眼就看到了它。

"Over here Asuka!" he shouted as he turned to look at her.

“这边，明日香！”他转身向她喊道。

Asuka was walking several yards behind him. The heat was getting to her it seemed.

明日香落在他身后几码远的地方，似乎是热浪让她有些吃不消。

"About fucking time," she said as she matched step with him and looked towards the shopping center.

“总算来了。”她一边说着，一边与他并肩而行，目光投向购物中心。

It wasn't large like some of the malls that used to litter Tokyo-3, but it would provide them with enough supplies for a while.

它不像那些曾经遍布第三新东京市的巨大购物中心，但足够他们暂时所需的物资了。

"Lets find what food we can first I suppose," said Shinji as he started forward.

“我们先找找有什么吃的吧，”真嗣说着，向前走去。

"More canned food I'm guessing," sighed Asuka.

“估计又是罐头食品吧，”明日香叹了口气。

"Not like we have much choice," shrugged Shinji.

“不像我们有很多选择，” 真嗣耸了耸肩。

There were several different stores in this shopping center, some of which were utterly useless to Shinji and Asuka. At least it had a grocery store.

这个购物中心里有几家不同的商店，其中一些对真嗣和明日香来说完全没用。至少这里有一家杂货店。

The glass was already broken at the front, so they only had to step around the broken glass, being careful not to cut themselves. The stench hit them first, and it was so powerful that Shinji felt like he may puke. Looking sideways at Asuka, he saw that she had her sleeve covering her noes; he did likewise. It was more than a month since the meat and produce had rotted away, but the smell was still lingering.

前门的玻璃已经碎了，他们只需绕过碎玻璃，小心不要割伤自己。首先袭来的是一股恶臭，强烈到真嗣觉得自己可能会吐出来。他侧眼看了看明日香，发现她正用袖子捂住鼻子；他也照做了。虽然肉和蔬菜已经腐烂了一个多月，但那股味道依然挥之不去。

Walking down the canned food isle, Shinji started grabbing stuff he knew wouldn't be difficult to cook with. Asuka was mostly silent as she walked beside him, trying to ignore the overpowering smell that was permeating through the store. Occasionally, she voiced her opinion when Shinji asked for it, but she typically just assumed Shinji knew what he was doing. She had respect for him as far as cooking went at least.

沿着罐头食品区走，真嗣开始拿取他知道烹饪起来不会太难的东西。明日香大部分时间都沉默地走在他身边，试图忽略弥漫在整个商店的浓烈气味。偶尔，当真嗣征求她的意见时，她会发表自己的看法，但她通常认为真嗣知道自己该怎么做。至少在烹饪方面，她对真嗣是尊重的。

Along with the food Shinji selected, he managed to acquire a dozen utensils, a wider selection of pots and pans, and several plastic plates.

除了真嗣挑选的食物，他还设法拿到了一打餐具，更多种类的锅碗瓢盆，以及几个塑料盘子。

As they were about to leave though, Shinji took a detour and went down another isle.

然而，就在他们准备离开时，真嗣绕了个弯，走向了另一个货架。

"What do you want here?" asked Asuka as she looked up at a sign hanging above the isle.

“你来这儿想找什么？”明日香抬头看着悬挂在过道上方的一块指示牌问道。

"Just a couple things to improve the taste," said Shinji as he reached for salt and pepper on one shelf.

“只是几样东西来提升味道，”真嗣说着，伸手从架子上取下盐和胡椒。

'I almost wish I could have had him cook with proper ingredients,' thought Asuka briefly.

“我几乎希望他能用合适的食材烹饪，”明日香短暂地想道。

Along with the salt and pepper, Shinji grabbed several bags of tea, sugar, garlic powder, and thankfully, soy sauce.

除了盐和胡椒，真嗣还抓了几包茶叶、糖、大蒜粉，幸好还有酱油。

"Happy now?" asked Asuka.

"现在高兴了吗？" 明日香问道。

"Truthfully...no," said Shinji as he looked around the store. "I'd prefer it if I had a few onions and other peppers. With what I have though, I should be able to make curry well enough."

"说实话...不怎么高兴，" 真嗣环顾商店说道，"如果能有几个洋葱和其他辣椒就好了。不过就现有的材料，我应该也能做出不错的咖喱。"

"Can't say I'm a fan of Japanese food," said Asuka. "Now German food..."

"我可不太喜欢日本料理，" 明日香说，"要说德国菜嘛..."

Asuka left her sentence hanging, making Shinji believe she was remembering her times in Germany.

明日香留下这句话悬而未决，让真嗣以为她在回忆在德国的时光。

"This should last us a while at least," said Shinji as he took one last look around the store. "Enough to get to Tokyo-2."

“这应该够我们用一段时间了，”真嗣环顾店铺最后一眼说道，“足够撑到东京-2 了。”

"What next then?" asked Asuka as she followed Shinji out of the store.

“接下来去哪儿？”明日香跟着真嗣走出商店问道。

"The department store I went to before, though we should still look out for any cars."

“我之前去的那家百货商店，不过我们还是得留意一下有没有车。”

Giving that the department store was several miles away Shinji was wondering if he wouldn't find it until nightfall. Thankfully though, Asuka seemed to be in a better mood since they had left the grocery store, and she seemed more willing to talk now. She told Shinji a little about her time in Germany, what it was like to go to college at such a young age, how she had felt when she learned she had been chosen as an Evangelion pilot. Shinji kept his silence most of the time, nodding at intervals between her sentences, but mostly, he just listened to her. He found that he was doing this more often than not.

考虑到百货商店距离这里有好几英里远，真嗣不禁担心自己可能要到天黑才能找到。不过幸运的是，自从离开杂货店后，明日香的情绪似乎好转了不少，现在她看起来更愿意交谈了。她向真嗣讲述了一些她在德国的生活，年纪轻轻上大学的经历，以及得知自己被选为 EVA 驾驶员时的感受。真嗣大部分时间都保持沉默，偶尔在她说话的间隙点头回应，但主要还是静静地聆听。他发现自己越来越常这样做。

Later though, they both lapsed into silence as Asuka had run out of things to talk about. Shinji somewhat felt that she had been talking just to ease her mind, as the idea of leaving Tokyo-3 was still very fresh in their mind. What if people showed up the day after they had left? Where they doing the right thing? Shinji wasn't entirely sure about that, but he didn't want to stay here forever either.

然而不久后，两人都陷入了沉默，因为明日香已经无话可说。真嗣隐约感觉到，她一直在说话只是为了缓解自己的心情，毕竟离开第三新东京市的念头在他们心中仍十分新鲜。如果他们离开后第二天就有人出现怎么办？他们这样做对吗？真嗣对此并不完全确定，但他也不想永远留在这里。

The sun was starting to set just as they crossed the parking lot towards the department store. Shinji wasn't sure how long they would be inside, but he didn't think they'd be making it very far tonight...and they still hadn't found a car.

当他们穿过停车场走向百货商店时，太阳正开始落山。真嗣不确定他们会在里面待多久，但他觉得今晚他们走不了多远...而且他们还没找到一辆车。

Stepping inside the store Shinji flicked the lighter on, wishing that he had something brighter than the flickering light waving back and forth.

走进商店，真嗣点燃了打火机，希望自己能有比这摇曳不定的微光更亮的东西。

"Lets finish this while we still have a little bit of sunlight left," said Shinji as he started walking around, looking for anything that would fit him.

“趁着还有点日光，我们赶紧结束吧，”真嗣说着开始四处走动，寻找任何适合他的东西。

"Hurry if you want to, but I'm going to take my time," said Asuka.

"想快就快吧，但我要慢慢来，" 明日香说道。

"Asuka, we can go back in tomorrow morning if we need to."

"明日香，如果需要的话，我们明天早上可以再回来。"

"Do whatever you want, but I'm going to enjoy this while I can. And this is not up for debate Shinji," said Asuka as she walked passed him towards woman's section.

"你想做什么就做什么，但我要趁现在好好享受。而且这没什么好争论的，真嗣，" 明日香说着，从他身边走过，朝女性区走去。

'Stubborn as usual,' thought Shinji as he watched her back disappear into some dark aisle.

'一如既往地固执，' 真嗣心想，看着她的背影消失在某个昏暗的过道里。

Shinji didn't spend long in the mens section, and found it difficult to find stuff that was even his size. He was able to get several jeans, a couple of t-shirts and one long sleeve shirt. His shoes he replaced with new ones, knowing that his current ones should have been thrown away long ago. He stocked up on socks and underwear, and even grabbed himself a jacket.

真嗣在男装区没花太多时间，发现很难找到适合自己尺码的衣服。他设法买了几条牛仔裤、几件 T 恤和一件长袖衬衫。他换上了新鞋，知道他现在的鞋子早该扔掉了。他补充了袜子和内衣，甚至还给自己拿了一件夹克。

Stuffing everything into his backpack, he hoisted it onto his shoulders. Walking towards the entrance where Asuka and himself had parted, he looked around, hoping that he would see her around somewhere.

他将所有东西塞进背包，扛到肩上。走向与明日香分别的入口处，他环顾四周，希望能看到她在某个角落。

"Not ready yet...huh..." mumbled Shinji. But he should have figured, since Asuka had said she was going to take as much time as was needed.

“还没准备好啊...”真嗣喃喃自语。但他早该料到，毕竟明日香说过她会花上所需的所有时间。

Deciding that he may as well look for her, Shinji walked towards the woman's department, passing all sorts of strange getups. As he ventured further though, Shinji started to notice where Asuka had picked the clothes clean. Some clothes were strewn across the floor, their hangers left beside them, looking as though they had been tried on and then flung to the side. Shinji couldn't help but smile, only imagining Asuka's reaction when she had been unsatisfied.

决定去找她，真嗣走向女装部，经过各种奇装异服。越往里走，他开始注意到明日香挑选衣服的痕迹。有些衣服散落在地上，衣架被丢在一旁，看起来像是试穿后不满意就被随手扔掉了。真嗣忍不住笑了，只能想象明日香当时的不满表情。

He passed more clothes that were left on the floor, almost following a path of sorts, that would lead him to Asuka. As he rounded a corner though, he had to pause as he had entered a rather embarrassing section. Rows upon rows of different colored underwear invaded Shinji's eyes, causing him to blink several times. It wasn't until he heard a voice though that he realized how screwed he was.

他穿过更多散落在地板上的衣物，几乎像是沿着某种路径，引领他走向明日香。然而，当他转过一个拐角时，不得不停下脚步，因为他闯入了一个颇为尴尬的区域。一排排各式各色内衣映入眼帘，让真嗣眨了好几下眼睛。直到他听到一个声音，才意识到自己陷入了多么糟糕的境地。

"...do they really have nothing smaller than this?" mumbled Asuka from amongst the lingerie section. She was holding up a pure white bra and looking at the size, and then she looked down at her own chest. Even though Shinji's view was partially obstructed by the many different colors, he could still make out Asuka's expression as she looked down at herself. She was frowning slightly.

“……难道真的没有比这更小的了吗？”明日香在女式内衣区喃喃自语。她拿起一件纯白色的胸罩，看着尺码，然后低头看了看自己的胸部。尽管真嗣的视线被众多颜色遮挡了一部分，他仍能辨认出明日香低头时的表情。她的眉头微微皱起。

After several seconds though, Asuka shrugged her shoulders and turned around so that her back was now facing Shinji. She pulled off the sweatshirt she was wearing and threw it to the ground, and did the same with her shirt. Her bare back was now facing Shinji. Taking the white bra, she clasped the latch behind her back and cupped it, holding it to her breasts, hoping that it wouldn't slide off. Removing her hands slowly, it seemed that it would hold, and she let out a sigh.

然而几秒钟后，明日香耸了耸肩，转过身去，让她的背现在正对着真嗣。她脱下穿着的卫衣，扔在地上，接着也脱掉了她的衬衫。她的裸背现在正对着真嗣。她拿起白色的胸罩，在背后扣上钩子，用手托住，希望它不会滑落。慢慢地移开双手，似乎它能固定住，她松了一口气。

"...Alright...now for-" she said this as she turned around, but that was when she spotted Shinji.

“……好吧……接下来要——”她边说边转过身，但就在这时她看到了真嗣。

They both stood still for several seconds, Asuka with her mouth slightly agape in surprise, and Shinji who was waiting for the hammer to fall.

他们俩都静止了几秒钟，明日香惊讶地微微张着嘴，而真嗣则在等待着那不可避免的爆发。

"How long have you been standing there?" Asuka was eventually able to say. She was shaking with anger, and her face was crimson. It had been a long time since Shinji had seen her this pissed.

“你站在那儿多久了？”最终，明日香开口问道。她气得浑身发抖，脸颊涨得通红。真嗣已经很久没见过她这么生气了。

"Um...I..." Shinji started.

"呃...我..." 真嗣开口道。

"Leave...now, before I fucking killing you," snarled Asuka. She looked about ready to strangle him.

"现在就滚...不然我他妈杀了你，" 明日香咆哮着。她看起来几乎要掐死他了。

"Right...sorry," mumbled Shinji who was blushing now as well. Without another word, Shinji turned around, and walked in the direction he had come from.

"好吧...对不起，" 真嗣咕哝着，脸也红了。没再多说一句话，真嗣转过身，朝他来的方向走去。

Asuka waited until she couldn't hear his footsteps anymore before she grabbed her t-shirt and sweatshirt, pulling them both over her head.

明日香一直等到听不见他的脚步声后，才抓起 T 恤和运动衫，将它们一起套过头。

"Stupid idiot," groaned Asuka. She really hoped that he hadn't seen the entirety of what had taken place, but she wasn't about to ask him either. Grabbing the underwear that she had chosen, she made her way to the back of the woman's section and entered a changing room, being sure to lock it. She couldn't make a stupid mistake like that again.

"笨蛋白痴，" 明日香咕哝着。她真心希望他没看到刚才发生的全部，但她也不打算问他。抓起她选好的内衣，她走向女装区的后面，进入一个试衣间，并确保锁好门。她不能再犯那种愚蠢的错误了。

Darkness had long set in before Asuka returned to the front of the store, and she was surprised to see that Shinji wasn't waiting for her. Looking out towards the parking lot though, she could see a small flicker of flame flashing on and then off. Walking towards it, she found Shinji laying on his sleeping bag and looking up at the night sky with the lighter in his hands.

当明日香回到商店前部时，天色早已暗下来，她惊讶地发现真嗣并没有在等她。不过，朝停车场望去，她能看到一抹微弱的火焰闪烁然后熄灭。朝那走去，她发现真嗣躺在他的睡袋上，手里拿着打火机，仰望着夜空。

"What are you doing?" she asked him. Her voice still held anger.

"Waiting for you of course," said Shinji as he looked up at her. "You took too long."

"当然是在等你，" 真嗣抬头看着她说，"你花了太长时间。"

"Who's fault do you think that partially is?" asked Asuka as she crossed her arms.

"你觉得这部分是谁的错？" 明日香交叉双臂问道。

"I said I was sorry."

"我说了对不起了。"

"Like thats ever going to be good enough," said Asuka as she passed him. 'You saw me practically naked afterall.' she thought later.

"就像那永远会够好似的，" 明日香从他身边走过时说。'你毕竟看到我几乎一丝不挂的样子了。' 她后来想道。

Sitting down across from him, she then asked, "So, all we need is the car and we should be fine."

她坐到他对面，接着问道：“那么，我们只需要一辆车，应该就没问题了。”

"While I was waiting for you, I walked ahead looking for one."

“我在等你的时候，已经先走了一圈去找车。”

"Let me guess...nothing?"

“让我猜猜...一无所获？”

"Correct." “正确。”

"Is it even possible to find one?" wondered Asuka as she lay down on her own sleeping bag.

“真的有可能找到吗？”明日香躺在自己的睡袋里思索着。

"Well somewhere in this city there should be."

“这座城市里应该有吧。”

"Yeah, but finding that one car is going to be a problem," said Asuka. Turning towards Shinji she said, "Hey, should we even be doing this? Leaving...and all. I know that it seems like the right decision, and I guess that we have a better chance finding other people if we start moving, but what if we we're supposed to stay here?"

“是啊，但找到那辆车可不容易，”明日香说道。她转向真嗣，“嘿，我们真的应该这么做吗？离开……还有这一切。我知道这似乎是正确的决定，而且我想如果我们开始移动，找到其他人的机会会更大，但如果我们本该留在这里呢？”

"What do you mean?" asked Shinji.

"你是什么意思？" 真嗣问道。

"Tokyo-3 is where Third Impact originated, yet we're the only ones here. Maybe there's a reason for that."

"东京-3 是第三次冲击的起源地，然而我们却是这里仅有的人。也许这背后有某种原因。"

"Or maybe we were just lucky," shrugged Shinji.

"或者我们只是运气好，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"...Maybe," said Asuka after a seconds pause.

“……或许吧，”明日香顿了顿，几秒后才说道。

Shinji watched what he could of her expression change in the darkness of the night. What exactly was she thinking?

碇真嗣在夜色的昏暗中观察着她表情所能展现的变化。她究竟在想些什么呢？

"I suppose we should just worry about the car then I guess," Asuka eventually said, alleviating the silence.

“我想我们还是先担心车子吧，大概。”明日香最终打破了沉默。

Now turning away from Shinji, she tried going to sleep, but found it difficult. She didn't like Tokyo-3 very much, but for a very short time, it had almost seemed like home to her. At least she had felt that she was respected while here. Now though, with it just being her and Shinji, there wasn't much of that respect left. Sure, she supposed that Shinji respected her within his own rights; what he was able to understand and grasp. But it was different compared to when she had been an Evangelion pilot.

现在转过身去不再看真嗣，她试图入睡，却发现很难。她并不太喜欢第三新东京市，但有那么短暂的一刻，这里几乎让她感到像家一样。至少在这里，她觉得自己受到了尊重。然而现在，只剩下她和真嗣，那种尊重所剩无几。当然，她认为真嗣在自己的理解范围内是尊重她的；他能够理解和把握的部分。但与她曾是 EVA 驾驶员时相比，感觉完全不同。

Nothing was the same as it once was, or could ever return to that way.

一切都已不复从前，也不可能再回到那种状态。

For the first time in a while, Asuka was the first to wake up.

时隔许久，明日香第一次先醒了过来。

She stretched as she sat up, letting the sleeping bag fall around her. She shivered slightly as a morning breeze blew across her face, making her hair dance briefly. Looking over at Shinji, she had to stifle a laugh as she saw his sleeping face poking out. She had a sudden urge to go over to him and hold his nose close, watching him inflate like a balloon.

她坐起身来，伸展着身体，任由睡袋滑落在四周。清晨的微风拂过脸颊，让她微微颤抖，发丝也随之轻舞片刻。她转头看向真嗣，见到他露出的睡颜，忍不住想笑却又得忍住。突然间，她有种冲动，想要走过去紧贴着他的鼻子，看他像气球一样鼓起来。

"Where did that childish thought come from?" wondered Asuka aloud. "I swear, his stupidity is starting to rub off on me."

“这种幼稚的想法是从哪儿冒出来的？”明日香大声自问，“我发誓，他的愚蠢开始传染给我了。”

Standing up, she walked several paces away from where Shinji was still sleeping and looked around at where they had made camp. From here, Asuka could see what remained of the tall skyscrapers that had once littered Tokyo-3. There certainly wasn't much left.

她站起身，从仍在熟睡的真嗣身边走开几步，环顾他们扎营的地方。从这里，明日香可以看到曾经遍布东京-3 的高楼大厦的残骸。确实没剩下多少了。

Hearing a noise behind her, Asuka turned, only to see that Shinji was simply shifting position in his sleeping bag. She watched him for several more seconds before she decided she may as well do something if she was awake this early.

听到身后的声响，明日香转过身，只见真嗣只是在睡袋里换了个姿势。她又观察了他几秒钟，然后决定既然这么早醒来，不如做点什么。

Walking over to Shinji's side, she bent down in front of his backpack and slowly unzipped it, watching his face incase his eyes opened. She withdrew several things, glad that Shinji didn't keep the lighter on his person.

她走到真嗣旁边，弯腰在他背包前，慢慢拉开拉链，同时留意着他的脸以防他睁开眼。她取出了几样东西，庆幸真嗣没有把打火机带在身上。

Gathering everything in a small circle away from where the sleeping bags were, she stood up and started looking around for any wood she could find. Thankfully, the corners of the street had newly planted trees in them, or what was left of them. The tree itself was little more than a single twig sticking up from the ground.

她将所有东西聚拢在一个远离睡袋的小圈子里，站起身来开始四处寻找可用的木头。幸运的是，街道角落里新栽的树木还残留着一些，或者说，只剩下这些了。那棵树本身不过是从地面伸出的一个小树枝。

Yanking it free, Asuka snapped it into several pieces and dragged it over to where she planned on building a fire. Stacking the sticks together, she flicked the lighter on several times until the flame caught. Now kneeling next to the fire she looked at the things she had pulled out of Shinji's backpack. Thankfully they had stocked up on as much water as possible, and even if she went through a bottle, there was plenty more back at the grocery store.

阿斯卡用力将其拔出，折成几段，拖到她打算生火的地方。她将树枝堆叠在一起，多次打火直到火焰燃起。现在跪在火堆旁，她看着从真嗣背包里拿出的东西。幸好他们尽可能多地储备了水，即使她用掉一瓶，杂货店里还有许多。

It wasn't exactly the way that she would have preferred making it, since she usually created it from scratch, but a mix would have to do.

这并不是她通常喜欢的方式，因为她通常是从零开始制作，但混合物也只能将就了。

'If only I had some blueberries or a banana,' thought Asuka.

“要是我有蓝莓或香蕉就好了。”明日香心想。

This would have to do though, she supposed.

尽管她觉得这可能不够，但眼下也只能这样了。

It was still another forty-five minutes before everything was ready. Feeling slightly odd about there places being switched, Asuka walked to where Shinji lay, and nudged him gently.

还需要四十五分钟一切才能准备就绪。对于位置的颠倒感到有些奇怪，明日香走向真嗣躺着的地方，轻轻地推了推他。

"Hey...I-" Asuka caught herself however, as she was about to call him an idiot once again. Biting her lip, and still not completely understanding why she was doing something like this, she tried again.

“嘿...我—”然而，明日香在即将再次称他为白痴时及时打住了。她咬了咬嘴唇，仍然不完全明白自己为什么要这么做，于是她又试了一次。

"Hey...Shinji..." she said as she moved his shoulder slightly. He turned in his sleep, obviously dreaming still. Asuka felt herself growing angry slightly.

"嘿...真嗣..." 她轻轻地摇了摇他的肩膀。他在睡梦中转了个身，显然还在做梦。明日香感到自己有些生气了。

"Wake up already...I made breakfast," she said as she nudged him more forcefully.

"快醒醒...我做了早餐，" 她更用力地推了推他。

Shinji mumbled something in his sleep this time and turned towards Asuka so that there faces were a mere inches apart. Backing away quickly, she felt her face suddenly heat up, knowing that she probably looked like an over ripened strawberry by now.

这次真嗣在睡梦中咕哝了些什么，转向明日香，两人的脸相距仅几英寸。她迅速后退，感到自己的脸突然发热，知道现在自己可能看起来像个熟透的草莓。

"If you don't wake up I swear I'm going to kick you awake," Asuka said much more loudly.

“你要是不醒，我发誓我会踢醒你。”明日香大声说道。

"Is that so?" mumbled Shinji from his sleeping bag.

"是吗？" 真嗣从睡袋里咕哝道。

Asuka felt herself blush even more furiously then, unaware that he had been awake for a while now apparently.

那一刻，明日香感到自己的脸更红了，她没有意识到他显然已经醒了一段时间。

"You...damn idiot," Asuka groaned.

"你……该死的傻瓜，" 明日香呻吟道。

Shinji opened one eye and looked at Asuka who was still several feet from him. Call him a fool, but he saw ample reason to tease her after she had done that so many times to him already. Asuka didn't seemed amused by this though.

真嗣睁开一只眼睛，看着还在几英尺外的明日香。称他为傻瓜吧，但他有充分的理由在她已经对他做了那么多次之后逗逗她。不过，明日香似乎对此并不觉得有趣。

Making good on her word, she stood up and quickly walked over to Shinji, planting her foot into his chest and rolling him over.

她说到做到，站起来迅速走向真嗣，一脚踩在他的胸口，把他翻了个身。

"Even after I went to all the trouble of making breakfast, you just had to go and act like an ass."

“即使我费尽心思做了早餐，你还是得像个混蛋一样行事。”

"You made breakfast?" asked Shinji, clearly surprised by this, ignoring the fact that Asuka had just kicked him. Though it hadn't been very rough.

"你做了早餐？" 真嗣问道，显然对此感到惊讶，忽略了明日香刚刚踢了他一脚的事实。虽然那并不算很重。

"What? Did you not hear me the first time?"

"什么？你没听到我第一次说的话吗？"

"I was sleeping." "我刚才在睡觉。"

"Liar," said Asuka with a slight sneer.

"骗子，"明日香带着一丝嘲讽说道。

Sitting up, Shinji looked over to where Asuka had created a fire. He saw that there was in fact a pan hanging in front of the fire.

坐起身来，真嗣朝明日香生火的地方望去。他看到那里确实挂着一个平底锅在火前。

"...I'm surprised," mumbled Shinji. "I thought you said you wouldn't ever cook even though you knew how?"

“……我真惊讶，”真嗣咕哝道，“我记得你说过即使你会做饭，也永远不会下厨的？”

"I said it was unlikely," said Asuka as she stood up and walked over to the fire. Removing the pan from over the fire, she grabbed one of the new plastic plates and turned the pan upside down over it. What could only be described as a pancake flopped down upon it.

“我说的是不太可能，”明日香说着站起身，走到火堆旁。她从火上取下平底锅，拿起一个新塑料盘子，将锅倒扣在盘子上。一个只能被形容为煎饼的东西啪嗒一声落在了盘子上。

Shinji watched her as she did all this, a puzzled expression plastered on his face.

真嗣看着她做这一切，脸上满是困惑的表情。

Bringing the plate over to him, Asuka thrust it into his hands and said, "Here take it."

阿斯卡把盘子递给他，塞到他手里说：“给，拿着。”

Shinji hesitated, unsure that this was right as Asuka had done the cooking in this case.

真嗣犹豫了，不确定这样做是否合适，毕竟这次是阿斯卡做的饭。

"Shouldn't you be the one that eats first considering you made this?"

"考虑到这是你做的，你不应该先吃吗？"

"Normally I wouldn't even offer you anything...though since you usually let me eat first and...oh, just shut up and take it Shinji," finished Asuka, somewhat angrily. Storming back to the fire, she sat down next to it and started preparing her own.

"通常我连给你都不会给的...不过既然你通常让我先吃，而且...哦，闭嘴，拿去吧，真嗣，"阿斯卡有些生气地结束了对话。她气冲冲地回到火堆旁，坐下来开始准备自己的食物。

Shinji had difficulty holding back a smile as he watched Asuka grumbling to herself. Ignoring the fact that they had recently acquired a larger selection of silverware, Shinji bit directly into the pancake. It was fluffy to say the least, and still warm being fresh from the fire.

真嗣看着阿斯卡自言自语地抱怨，忍不住想笑。他无视了他们最近刚添置了更多餐具的事实，直接咬了一口煎饼。至少可以说，煎饼松软可口，而且还是刚从火上烤出来的，依然温热。

"Well...how is it?" came a quiet voice from near the fire.

“嗯……怎么样？”篝火旁传来一个轻柔的声音。

Shinji looked over and saw that Asuka was turned towards him, her face somewhat passive.

真嗣转头望去，看到明日香正转向他，脸上带着几分淡然。

Shinji wasn't sure how he was exactly supposed to reply to that. How difficult was it to screw up making pancakes anyway? Even so, he figured he should compliment her since that was what she seemed to be looking for.

真嗣不确定自己到底该如何回应。做煎饼能有多难搞砸呢？即便如此，他想他应该夸奖她，因为那似乎是她所期待的。

"It's good, really good."

“很好吃，真的很好吃。”

"Hmph," snorted Asuka as she turned back to the fire. "You don't have to tell me that."

“哼，”明日香哼了一声，转回火炉前。“你不用告诉我这个。”

She said this, but Shinji noticed that the corners of her mouth were pulled upwards ever so slightly.

她虽这么说，但真嗣注意到她的嘴角微微上扬。

After Asuka had made her own portion as well and eaten, they packed everything up, stamped out the fire, and starting searching for the last thing they needed. They talked occasionally as they walked, but the sun was high in the sky now, and Shinji didn't think that Asuka was enjoying the sudden spike in temperature. As usual, he was fine himself.

在明日香也做好自己的份并吃完后，他们收拾好所有东西，踩灭火堆，开始寻找他们所需的最后一样物品。他们边走边偶尔交谈，但此时太阳高悬天空，真嗣觉得明日香并不喜欢这突如其来的高温。一如既往，他自己倒是安然无恙。

How was it that they weren't able to find a single damn car that had the keys in the ignition. Did everybody vanish without a trace along with their keys? Even if they did find a car, there was still no guarantee that it would start. Then there was the many that had been crushed by some random debris.

他们怎么就找不到一辆钥匙插在点火器上的该死的车呢？难道每个人都连同钥匙一起消失得无影无踪了吗？即便他们真的找到了一辆车，也无法保证它一定能启动。更别提还有许多车被随意的废墟压得面目全非。

Even Shinji was starting to get annoyed by this road block they had faced. Walking was fine with him, but Asuka had started to complain loudly about it.

就连真嗣也开始对这条他们遇到的障碍路感到恼火了。走路对他来说还好，但明日香已经开始大声抱怨起来。

"I'm taking a break," said Asuka as she suddenly stopped in the middle of the street.

“我要休息一下，”明日香突然在街道中央停下来说道。

Shinji couldn't really blame her since he was frustrated as well. He still decided to continue forward.

真嗣不能真的怪她，因为他自己也感到沮丧。他还是决定继续前进。

"Alright, I'm gonna continue forward though. I'll come back in twenty minutes or so."

“好的，我还是继续往前走。大概二十分钟左右我会回来。”

"Take as long as you like," said Asuka as she slid down into the shade of a building and opened a bottle of water.

“慢慢来，不着急。”明日香说着，滑入建筑的阴影中，打开了一瓶水。

Shinji nodded, and started walking out into the distance.

真嗣点点头，开始向远处走去。

Asuka watched him until he rounded a corner and disappeared from her sight. She couldn't believe that he could continue going forward even in this heat. Granted, he must have been used to it, growing up in Japan all his life, but it was too much for Asuka who hadn't been here very long. Then again, it was also possible that Third Impact had changed the earth's climate somehow.

明日香一直看着他，直到他转过街角，从她的视线中消失。她难以相信他能在这样的酷热中继续前行。当然，他从小在日本长大，肯定习惯了这种天气，但对刚来不久的明日香来说，这实在太难熬了。不过，也有可能是第三次冲击改变了地球的气候。

Even more than that though, Shinji surprised Asuka sometimes. He was a wimp, meek, and an idiot. But Asuka was surprised at how resilient he could be at times. The fact that he had walked some 50 plus miles in the span of two days...that was difficult for her to comprehend. Not just that, but that he seemed able to walk an indefinite amount of distance without tiring. Was he simply stupid or stubborn?

尽管如此，真嗣有时还是会让明日香感到惊讶。他是个懦夫，胆小，又是个傻瓜。但明日香惊讶于他有时能有多么坚韧。他在两天内步行了五十多英里...这一点她很难理解。不仅如此，他还似乎能够无休止地行走而不感到疲惫。他只是愚蠢还是固执呢？

She hated remembering how much he had done for her in the short time that they had known each other, but it wasn't exactly something she could forget either. No matter what she told herself, her and Shinji were in this together, and there wasn't anyway getting around that.

她讨厌回忆起在这么短的时间内他为她的付出，但这也不是她能轻易忘记的事情。无论她怎么告诉自己，她和真嗣都陷在这件事里，这是无法回避的事实。

'Hey may be a complete idiot, but he can be reliable at times.'

“他可能是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，但有时他也能靠得住。”

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"Ehhh!?" "诶？！"

Asuka jumped, startled by the sudden reappearance of the person she had just been thinking about.

明日香吓了一跳，被她刚刚还在想着的人突然再次出现吓到了。

Shinji stood in front of her, looking down at the girl who seemed to have been spacing out moments ago.

真嗣站在她面前，低头看着刚才似乎在发呆的女孩。

"You okay, you're eyes were glazed over and-"

"你没事吧，你的眼睛都呆滞了，而且——"

"Shut up you idiot," said Asuka as she stood up and started shaking Shinji roughly. Her face was a dull shade of pink.

"闭嘴，你这个白痴，" 明日香说着站起身来，开始粗鲁地摇晃真嗣。她的脸颊泛着暗淡的粉红色。

"Asu-ka you're hurt-ing me," gasped Shinji.

"Asu-ka 你弄疼我了," 真嗣喘息道。

Pushing him away, Asuka grabbed her backpack and stomped out from under the shade of the building. She had forgotten briefly about the sun, which was now beating down on her face again.

阿斯兰推开他，抓起背包，气冲冲地从建筑物的阴影下走了出去。她一时忘了太阳的存在，现在阳光又再次打在她的脸上。

"Arghhh! When the hell are we going to get out of here!?" shouted Asuka.

"啊啊啊！我们到底什么时候才能离开这个鬼地方！？" 阿斯兰喊道。

"Actually, about that," said Shinji as he walked up and stood by Asuka.

"实际上，关于那件事，" 真嗣边说边走过来，站在明日香旁边。

"What," she asked as she rounded on him.

"什么？" 她转身面对他问道。

"I think I found a car."

"我想我找到了一辆车。"

"You did? Seriously?" asked Asuka. She could have almost hugged him.

“你真的做了？”明日香问道，她几乎想要拥抱他了。

"Yeah," said Shinji as he scratched his cheek. "Though there is a bit of a problem with that..."

“嗯，”真嗣挠了挠脸颊，“不过这事儿有点小麻烦……”

Shinji led Asuka to where he had found the car; a station wagon parked next to a building that looked like a bomb had exploded inside it.

真嗣领着明日香来到他发现那辆车的地方；一辆旅行车停在一栋建筑旁，那建筑看起来就像内部被炸弹炸过一样。

"So whats the problem then?" asked Asuka as Shinji pointed the car out to her. "It seems fine to me, but don't tell me it has a flat or something."

“那问题出在哪儿呢？”明日香问道，真嗣向她指出了那辆车。“我看挺好的，但别告诉我它爆胎了什么的。”

"No, nothing like that but...it's a manual...I think."

“不，不是那样的问题，但是……它是手动挡的……我想。”

"You think? Oh forget it, you're useless. Let me see."

"你这么认为？算了，你没用。让我看看。"

Pushing past Shinji, Asuka climbed into the driver side seat and sat down. The car was in better condition then she had expected, even all the windows were fine. Looking behind the seat, she saw that there were two suitcases stacked on top of each other. Plenty of room though for stuff of their own.

阿斯兰推开真嗣，爬进驾驶座坐下。车况比她预想的要好，连窗户都完好无损。她朝座椅后面看去，发现有两个手提箱叠放在一起。不过，还是有足够的空间放他们自己的东西。

Turning her attention back to the front of the car though, she saw what Shinji had meant. Certainly, it was a manual transmission. Asuka had never driven a car before, though she knew the basics like gas, brake, steering and what not. Manual was something that was more challenging though. She wasn't about to give up however.

然而，当她将注意力转回车前时，她明白了真嗣的意思。确实，这是一辆手动挡汽车。尽管明日香从未驾驶过汽车，但她对油门、刹车、转向等基本操作有所了解。手动挡则更具挑战性。不过，她并没有打算放弃。

"Well?" asked Shinji. "嗯？" 真嗣问道。

"It is a manual." "这是一本手册。"

"So what now? Should we search for another or-"

"那现在怎么办？我们应该再找一本还是——"

"And how long would that take?" asked Asuka. "Another three days? No, I want to get out of here. Besides, this has plenty of room in the back."

"那需要多久？" 明日香问道。"再三天？不，我想离开这里。而且，这车后面空间很大。"

"Do you expect me to drive it?" asked Shinji.

"你指望我来开吗？" 真嗣问道。"

"No I don't, and I never did. I'm going to be driving."

"不，我没这么想，也从未这么想过。我来开。"

This statement shocked Shinji. First breakfast and now this? What had happened to the selfish, unhelpful Asuka he had been used to?

这番话让真嗣震惊了。先是早餐，现在又是这样？那个自私、帮不上忙的明日香怎么了？

"You serious about this?" asked Shinji.

“你是认真的吗？”真嗣问道。

"Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out by tomorrow."

“别担心。我明天之前会搞定的。”

Shinji wasn't sure how to react to this promise, so he just let her do as she pleased.

真嗣不确定该如何回应这个承诺，所以他只是任由她随心所欲。

Shinji made dinner that night, while Asuka spent most of her time sitting in the car. She had figured how to get it started by turning the ignition and pressing down on the clutch, but after that she seemed to have gotten lost. Shinji could occasionally hear her curses of anger or bangs as she hit the steering wheel.

那天晚上，真嗣做了晚饭，而明日香大部分时间都坐在车里。她已经知道如何通过转动点火开关和踩下离合器来启动汽车，但之后似乎就迷失了方向。真嗣偶尔能听到她的愤怒咒骂声或她敲打方向盘的砰砰声。

Starting to find it annoying however, Shinji stood up and almost had to drag her out of the car to get her to eat. Afterwards, she went right back to trying to get it to move.

然而，渐渐感到烦躁的碇真嗣站起身，几乎要把她从车里拽出来才让她吃点东西。之后，她立刻又回去试图让车动起来。

He wasn't sure when, but at some point during the night, he had fallen asleep. Waking up, Shinji first noticed that the car had moved slightly from its previous position. It was further along the road now then it had been.

他不记得具体是什么时候，但在夜里的某个时刻，他不知不觉睡着了。醒来时，碇真嗣首先注意到车子已经稍微移动了位置。现在它比之前更靠前了。

Walking over to it, Shinji saw that Asuka was sitting upright in the car and looking at the steering wheel.

走近一看，碇真嗣发现明日香正笔直地坐在车里，盯着方向盘。

"Figure it out yet?" "想明白了没？"

"I think so," said Asuka, seemingly half asleep. "Every time I shift gears, I have to press down on the clutch, but if I do it to suddenly, the car stalls. Also, if my speed gets above a certain point I have to shift as well. Putting it to practical use is going to take some time, though I guess we have plenty of that. On the plus, the gas tank is full so we don't have to worry about that for a while."

"我想是的，"" 明日香似乎半睡半醒地说，""每次换挡，我都得踩下离合器，但如果我突然这么做，车子就会熄火。而且，如果车速超过某个点，我也得换挡。实际应用还需要一些时间，不过我想我们有的是时间。好在油箱是满的，所以我们暂时不用担心这个。"

Asuka yawned widely here and slouched backwards in her seat.

明日香在这里大大地打了个哈欠，懒洋洋地靠在椅背上。

"Now as long as I don't crash, everything should be fine."

"只要我不坠机，一切应该都没问题。"

"Don't joke about that." "别开这种玩笑。"

"Well...I'm not really joking, since I am worried about that."

"嗯...我其实不是在开玩笑，因为我确实担心这个。"

"You need to sleep," said Shinji.

"你需要睡觉了," 真嗣说道。

"That probably would be best," yawned Asuka as she stepped out of the car and closed the door. She stumbled slightly as she did this, but Shinji caught her. Not realizing how close they were, they both looked back each other for a few seconds before Asuka lowered her gaze.

"那样可能最好," 明日香打着哈欠，从车里出来并关上了门。她踉跄了一下，但真嗣扶住了她。两人都没意识到彼此靠得有多近，他们互相凝视了几秒钟，随后明日香垂下了目光。

"Thanks," she said as she broke free of Shinji's grasp and walked towards her sleeping bag, almost falling asleep immediately.

"谢谢," 她说着挣脱了真嗣的搀扶，走向她的睡袋，几乎立刻就睡着了。

Even though she was the one who had thanked him, Shinji felt it should have been himself who was saying thanks instead.

尽管是她向他道谢，但真嗣觉得应该是自己向她表示感谢才对。

They left late that morning, after Asuka had gotten up and eaten breakfast. She still seemed to be tired from last night, but determined to leave all the same. They packed everything in the car and climbed into the driver and passenger seats respectively. Asuka started it but took several seconds before she put it in gear. She moved slowly, not wanting to shift to anything higher than second. It made sense considering how much debris they had to drive around.

那天早上他们出发得很晚，等明日香起床并吃完早餐后。她似乎仍因昨晚而疲惫，但依然决心离开。他们把所有东西都装进车里，分别坐进驾驶座和副驾驶座。明日香启动了车子，但过了几秒钟才挂上档。她动作缓慢，不想挂到比二档更高的档位。考虑到他们需要绕过多少碎片，这样做是有道理的。

She concentrated for the first half hour, but after she got the feel of it, she started to relax. Shinji was impressed by how easily Asuka had grasped the concepts of a manual transmission. It hadn't even taken her a full night, and she was already used to it.

她集中精神开了前半小时，但掌握了感觉后，她开始放松下来。真嗣对明日香如此迅速掌握手动挡的概念感到惊讶。她甚至没用上一整晚，就已经习惯了。

They had to take several detours, avoiding entire sections of road which had buildings collapsed upon them. Since Shinji was navigating though, this wasn't much of a problem. He had already memorized much of the cities streets.

他们不得不绕行多次，避开那些被建筑物倒塌覆盖的路段。但由于是真嗣在导航，这并没有构成太大问题。他已经记住了城市中许多街道的位置。

As the road towards Tokyo-2 started to get closer though, and Asuka more and more started to get the feel for driving, Shinji decided to ask her something.

然而，随着前往东京-2 的路途逐渐临近，而明日香对驾驶的感觉也越来越好，真嗣决定向她提出一个问题。

"Um...Asuka?" “呃...明日香？”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Is it okay if I ask you something?"

"我可以问你一个问题吗？"

"Do you mean okay as in, 'is it okay to ask me while I'm driving? Or okay because its personal?"'

"你是说，‘我在开车时问你问题可以吗？’还是因为这个问题很私人？"

"Both actually. Is that a problem"

"两者都有。这有问题吗？"

"Nah, its fine." “没事，挺好的。”

Taking what she said as truth, Shinji asked-

将她的话视为事实，真嗣问道——

"How come you're being more helpful recently. You cooked breakfast and then took it upon yourself to learn how to drive this car. Why?"

"最近你怎么变得这么热心了？不仅做了早餐，还主动去学开这辆车。为什么？"

"Does it bother you that I decided to do something for once?"

"难道我决定做点什么会让你困扰吗？"

"No...I just don't understand...why now?"

"不……我只是不明白……为什么是现在？"

Asuka took several seconds to reply, her eyes focused on the road in front. When she did, she was surprised at how easily the words came to her.

绫波花了好几秒才回答，她的目光始终聚焦在前方的道路上。当她终于开口时，她惊讶于这些话竟如此自然地脱口而出。

"Well, to put it mildly, you could say that I haven't been doing a damn thing recently."

"好吧，说得委婉点，你可以说我最近什么鬼事都没干。"

"But you weren't able to walk long ago Asu-"

"但你在不久前还不能走路——"

"Don't interrupt me Shinji," said Asuka rather coldly. "You're the one that found all these supplies, the one that cooks every night, the one that went out of his way to help me on my feet." She paused very briefly here before she finished with, "The one that saved me."

"别打断我，真嗣，" 明日香相当冷淡地说道。"是你找到了所有这些补给，是你每晚做饭，是你不遗余力地帮助我重新站起来。" 她在这里非常短暂地停顿了一下，然后以 "救了我的人" 作为结束。"

"If I had never left in the first place," started Shinji

"如果我一开始就没有离开，" 真嗣开口道

"Stop blaming yourself for that...and you still came back. You've been the one thats always been doing something, while I've been sitting around complaining the entire time. Well, I finally decided that I wanted to do something about that. I can't just keep pushing off all the responsibility onto you. Besides, you said it yourself-"

别再为那件事自责了……你还是回来了。一直以来都是你在行动，而我却只是坐在这里抱怨个不停。好吧，我终于决定要为此做点什么了。我不能总是把所有责任都推给你。而且，你自己也说过——

Turning towards Shinji, Asuka smiled briefly before she said, "We don't have much choice but to live together, and even if we won't enjoy it, we still have to deal with that. However, in order to live together, we'll have to work together and learn to get along with each other so that we can survive. We're stuck like this together I guess."

转向真嗣，明日香短暂地笑了笑，然后说道：“我们别无选择，只能一起生活，即使我们不会享受这种状态，我们仍然得面对它。然而，为了共同生活，我们必须共同努力并学会相互相处，以便能够生存下去。我想，我们就是这样被绑在一起的。”

"I don't remember saying something like that..." mumbled Shinji.

“我不记得说过那样的话……”真嗣喃喃自语。

"Well, it was along those lines I think," shrugged Asuka.

“嗯，我想大概是那个意思吧，”明日香耸了耸肩。

Rolling down the driver side window, Asuka looked out towards the ocean and decided to park the car briefly. They were just about to leave Tokyo-3 after all.

阿斯卡下司机侧车窗，望向大海，决定暂时停车。毕竟，他们正准备离开第三新东京市。

Both of them got out and walked towards the back of the car and looked out towards the city that they were about to leave behind. They were going to follow the coast until they hit Tokyo-2. Shinji had said that it shouldn't take longer than a couple of hours.

两人下车，走向车尾，望向即将离开的城市。他们将沿着海岸线前行，直到抵达第二新东京市。真嗣说过，这应该不会超过几个小时。

"Think we'll see it again?" asked Asuka.

“你觉得我们还会再见到它吗？”阿斯卡问道。

"Probably," said Shinji. "...Though I don't think it will be for a while."

"大概吧，" 真嗣说。"...不过我想不会是很快。"

"Look at it for as long as you like then," said Asuka.

"你想看多久就看多久，" 明日香说。"

"No...this is probably enough. We weren't in the city very long though, but it had still seemed familiar for a while. After this, everything is going to be new."

"不...这样大概就够了。我们在城里待的时间并不长，但那段时间里一切似乎都很熟悉。之后，一切都将变得新鲜。"

"True...well, we should get going. I'd rather not have to try driving at night quite yet."

确实...好吧，我们该出发了。我还不怎么想尝试夜间开车。

"Probably for the best..."

"或许这样最好……"

"What is that supposed to mean?"

"你这么说是什么意思？"

"You almost stalled the car several times as we left the city."

"我们离开城市时，你差点让车熄火好几次了。"

"That was because I was still learning you idiot. Do you wanna try driving this slow thing?"

"那是因为我还在学习，你这个白痴。你想试试开这辆慢车吗？"

They bickered like that as they climbed back into the station wagon, unsure where the future would take them.

他们就这样一边争吵一边爬回旅行车，不确定未来会将他们带向何方。

So they left behind Tokyo-3. For better or for worse, I know I'm gonna enjoy writing the next few chapters.

于是他们离开了第三新东京市。不论未来是好是坏，我知道我会享受接下来几章的创作。

### Chapter 9: Hesitation 

Another chapter here. Not much to say about this as its just building further on Shinji and Asuka's relationship. I know most of you are wondering where the hell I'm going with this. Keep calm though, as I got a lot planned ahead for this story. (Some of which may happen in chapters not far away)

这里是另一个 chapter。关于这个章节，没什么太多可说的，只是进一步构建真嗣和明日香的关系。我知道你们大多数人都在想我到底要把这个故事带向何方。不过请保持冷静，因为我为这个故事规划了很多内容（其中一些可能会在不远的章节中发生）。

---

The trip to Tokyo-2 took longer than they had intended. About two hours into the long trip, Asuka decided that they were going to stop at the nearest rest station. Though Shinji complained about this, saying he wanted to get to Tokyo-2 before it got dark, Asuka shot this down immediately. Shinji was starting to think he understood why Asuka had wanted to drive. If she was driving, that meant that she got to make the decision of whether they stopped or not.

前往东京-2 的旅程比他们预期的要长。大约两个小时后，明日香决定在最近的休息站停下来。尽管真嗣抱怨说想在天黑前到达东京-2，但明日香立刻否决了这个提议。真嗣开始明白为什么明日香想要开车了。如果她开车，那就意味着她可以决定是否停下来。

The drive itself was uneventful. The scenery flew by as Asuka brought the car up to fifty-five along long stretches of road. Shinji looked past Asuka and out the driver side window, looking down on the beaches below them. At one point, he guessed that these beaches had been filled with people. Now, the only thing that rested upon them was drift wood.

这段车程本身平淡无奇。风景随着明日香将车速提到五十五码而在长长的公路上飞逝。真嗣透过明日香望向驾驶座窗外，俯瞰着下方的海滩。他猜想，这些海滩曾经挤满了人。如今，唯一留在上面的是漂流木。

Tokyo-3 had long since disappeared behind them, and they hardly spoke as they made there way to Tokyo-2, They passed rolling hills along the right side the entire way there. Farm land covered this mostly, with sparse communities here and there.

第三新东京市早已消失在他们身后，前往第二新东京市的路上他们几乎没怎么说话。沿途右侧尽是连绵起伏的丘陵。这些地方大多被农田覆盖，零星散布着一些社区。

Eventually, they started climbing a steep hill, making Asuka having to down shift into a lower gear. Shinji remembered this hill though, as when he had ridden by taxi, the driver had flown down it. He told Asuka that after this steep incline they would get there first real look at Tokyo-2. Shinji had been excited initially, but that had worn off quickly.

最终，他们开始攀爬一座陡峭的山丘，迫使明日香不得不降档至低速挡。真嗣记得这座山丘，因为他曾乘出租车经过，司机当时飞速冲下山坡。他告诉明日香，翻过这个陡坡后，他们将首次真正看到第二新东京市。真嗣起初很兴奋，但很快这种感觉就消退了。

Tokyo-2 didn't have much in common with Tokyo-3, besides having similar names. The city was significantly smaller than Tokyo-3 and was often considered to be one giant slum. When construction of Tokyo-3 had commenced, the city had started to deteriorate. Even now, the only thing that still held any significance within the city was the capital, and that had been scheduled to be moved to Tokyo-3.

东京-2 与东京-3 除了名字相似外，并没有太多共同之处。这座城市明显比东京-3 小得多，常被视为一个巨大的贫民窟。当东京-3 开始建设时，东京-2 便开始衰败。即便到了现在，这座城市中唯一仍具重要性的只有首都，而首都也计划迁往东京-3。

As they reached the top of the hill, Asuka parked the car briefly so that they could take there first look at the city. As far as Third Impact went, the city wasn't much better off than Tokyo-3 had been. The city itself may have been more intact, but it was apparent that there had been some damage. Afterall, Tokyo-2 wasn't far from the epicenter of Third Impact. Some of the more larger building had clearly collapsed upon themselves and the water level had risen so that the western portion of the city was underwater.

当他们到达山顶时，明日香短暂地停下车，让他们第一次俯瞰这座城市。就第三次冲击而言，这座城市的情况并不比东京-3 好多少。城市本身可能保存得更完好，但显然遭受了一些破坏。毕竟，东京-2 离第三次冲击的震中并不远。一些较大的建筑明显已经倒塌，水位上升导致城市的西部地区被淹没。

Looking out at this forlorn landscape, they almost wished that they had stayed put in Tokyo-3. Glancing at each other, Shinji and Asuka got back in their car and cruised the rest of the way into the city.

望着这片荒凉的景象，他们几乎希望自己留在东京-3。相视一眼后，真嗣和明日香回到车上，继续驶向城市深处。

By the time they reached the heart of the city, darkness had settled upon them. They had been traveling down what must have once been a busy thoroughfare, when Asuka decided to park the car. She pulled the car onto a side street, weaving around the broken down cars as she did so. Low income apartment buildings lined either side of them, the railings having rusting long ago. Shinji was almost tempted to explore these buildings for supplies, but eventually thought otherwise. The infrastructure didn't seem all that stable.

当他们抵达城市中心时，夜幕已经降临。他们沿着曾经繁忙的街道行驶，直到明日香决定停车。她将车开进一条小路，绕过那些废弃的车辆。低收入公寓楼排列在两侧，栏杆早已锈迹斑斑。真嗣几乎想探索这些建筑寻找物资，但最终还是打消了念头。基础设施看起来并不那么稳固。

"Is this where we're staying tonight?" asked Shinji as Asuka turned the car off.

“我们今晚就住这儿吗？”真嗣问道，明日香熄灭了引擎。

"Unless you've got a better idea?" asked Asuka.

“除非你有更好的主意？”明日香反问。

No, he didn't. But this brought up another question. How were both of them going to sleep in this car? The back had enough room for both of them he supposed, but sleeping that close to each other was...

不，他没有。但这引出了另一个问题。他们俩怎么在这辆车里睡觉呢？他认为后座足够容纳两人，但如此近距离地睡在一起……

Quickly though, Shinji realized how it was going to be, when Asuka got out of the driver seat, climbed into the back, and started unrolling her sleeping bag. She laid down on it, not saying a word to Shinji, but she gave him a look that said, "don't even try sleeping back here with me." So Shinji was forced to sleep upright in the passenger seat with his sleeping bag draped over himself.

然而，很快，真嗣意识到情况会如何发展，当明日香从驾驶座上下来，爬到后座，开始展开她的睡袋。她躺在上面，没有对真嗣说一句话，但她给了他一个眼神，仿佛在说：“别想和我一起睡在这里。”于是，真嗣被迫直挺挺地坐在副驾驶座上，用睡袋盖住自己。

Sleep came fitfully as you would expect, and Shinji found himself wondering if he had even slept at all when he awoke early the next morning. Predictably, he was first to awake, and started preparing breakfast, using whatever wood he had found littering the street. He started the fire on the sidewalk, several feet away from the car. Watching the reflection of the fire dancing on the side of the car made Shinji reflect on how far they had come since...well, months now he supposed. It was difficult to gauge time with the world as it was.

正如你所料，睡眠断断续续，真嗣醒来时发现自己甚至怀疑是否真的睡着了。不出所料，他是第一个醒来的，开始准备早餐，用他在街上找到的任何木头。他在离车几英尺的人行道上生火。看着火光在车身上的舞动，真嗣不禁思考起他们从……嗯，几个月前到现在所经历的一切。在这个世界里，时间变得难以衡量。

Placing the pot on the fire, he poured some water into it and then started adding ingredients. They had enough food for a while, but Shinji felt that he should still keep a lookout for any grocery stores while they looked around.

他将锅放在火上，倒了一些水进去，然后开始加入各种食材。他们的食物还够吃一段时间，但真嗣觉得在四处探索时，还是应该留意一下有没有杂货店。

Looked around for what though was the question? There wasn't any meaning in them really being here in Tokyo-2. He just knew that neither of them wanted to continue staying in Tokyo-3. Tokyo-2...it wasn't as though Shinji thought they'd be staying here forever; he didn't see it that way at all. More like...a place for them to stop until they settled down.

但问题是，他们在这里寻找什么呢？在第二东京市，他们并没有什么真正的意义。他只是知道，他们俩都不想继续留在第三东京市。第二东京市……真嗣并不认为他们会永远留在这里；他完全没有这样想过。更像是……一个让他们暂时停留，直到安定下来的地方。

'Settle down?' wondered Shinji. 'What a strange thought...'

"安定下来？" 真嗣心想，"真是个奇怪的想法……"

Strange, but it oddly seemed to have some truth to it. Could they really continue to wander forever? Shinji didn't think so. Staying in one place did certainly seem like a strange idea, one that seemed almost impossible in this world. But the thought at least...

奇怪，但这似乎又有几分道理。他们真的能永远流浪下去吗？真嗣不这么认为。停留在一个地方确实显得很奇怪，在这个世界里几乎是不可能的想法。但至少这个念头……

'Though with Asuka...' thought Shinji as he looked towards the car. He couldn't see her from where he sat on the sidewalk, but had to assume she was still sleeping. This journey, or whatever it was, if he thought about it terms of mutual survival, then it made sense. Actually staying in one place, like a house or something was permanent. Not to mention, that it then would feel like their relationship had changed, or this is how Shinji viewed it at least. He couldn't imagine Asuka would enjoy this change either.

‘尽管有明日香在……’真嗣望着车子想道。他坐在人行道上，看不到她，但猜想她应该还在睡觉。这段旅程，或者说无论是什么，如果从共同生存的角度来考虑，那就说得通了。真正停留在一个地方，比如一栋房子，是永久性的。更不用说，那样的话他们的关系会发生变化，至少真嗣是这么看的。他无法想象明日香会喜欢这种变化。

As he was thinking about this, Asuka stirred inside the car and sat up, rubbing her eyes as she did so. It took her eyes a minute to adjust, and she was momentarily surprised when she saw the flames so close. On further inspection though, it was simply reflected in the window of the car. She turned her eyes instead to Shinji. He wasn't quite looking at her, but was instead staring at the side of the car. He seemed to realize that she was awake though, because he looked up at her.

正当他思考着这些时，明日香在车内动了动，坐起身来，揉着眼睛。她的眼睛花了片刻才适应，当她看到火焰如此接近时，一时间有些惊讶。但仔细一看，那不过是车窗上的倒影。她转而看向真嗣。他并没有直接看她，而是盯着车的一侧。不过，他似乎意识到她醒了，因为他抬头看向她。

"Breakfast is almost done," said Shinji.

“早餐快好了。”真嗣说道。

Though there was a window that separated them, Asuka still heard him. She nodded once, and climbed back into the driver seat and opened the door. Walking around the car she sat down across from Shinji.

尽管有一扇窗隔着，明日香还是听到了他的话。她点了点头，爬回驾驶座并打开车门。绕过车子，她坐在了真嗣对面。

Yawning widely, attempting to stifle it with her hand; Shinji couldn't help but notice this.

打着哈欠，试图用手遮掩；真嗣不禁注意到了这一点。

"Sleep well?" he asked her.

“睡得好吗？”他问她。

"Course, though I can't say the same when I look at you," smirked Asuka.

“当然，不过看你这样子，我可不敢苟同，”明日香带着一丝嘲讽地笑了。

"Well, being stuck upright in a seat isn't the most comfortable."

"嗯，直挺挺地坐在座位上确实不太舒服。"

Asuka didn't bother commenting on this.

明日香懒得对此发表评论。

"So, what should we do today?"

"那么，我们今天该做些什么呢？"

"Get an idea for the area at least, and find places that may have supplies."

"至少对这个地区有个大致了解，并找到可能有补给的地方。"

"Weren't you here before you came to Tokyo-3 though? Don't you remember anything?"

"你不是之前来过这里吗？难道什么都不记得了？"

"I was only here for a couple of days, and I didn't leave my hotel room during that time. I was living out in the countryside before I came here."

"我在这里只待了几天，而且那段时间我都没离开过酒店房间。来这里之前，我一直住在乡下。"

"Useless," sighed Asuka. “没用的，”明日香叹息道。

'Like you're one to talk,' thought Shinji. Replying as such wouldn't do anything except to invite Asuka's fury though.

“好像你就有资格说这话似的，”真嗣心想。但这样回应只会招来明日香的怒火，毫无益处。

After they finished breakfast, Shinji packed everything up and they got back in the car. Pulling out of the side street, they got back on the main road and started driving. Asuka drove slowly, both of them looking around at the buildings they passed. Nothing stood out to them in particular. The city seemed just as miserable as Tokyo-3, if not worse. At least Tokyo-3 had seemed somewhat familiar.

早餐结束后，真嗣收拾好一切，两人重新上车。驶离小巷，回到主干道，他们继续前行。明日香缓慢驾驶，两人环顾四周的建筑。没有什么特别吸引他们的。这座城市似乎和第三新东京市一样令人沮丧，甚至更糟。至少第三新东京市还有些许熟悉感。

'Were we really correct in leaving Tokyo-3 and coming here instead?' thought Shinji.

“我们真的做对了吗？离开第三新东京市，来到这里？”真嗣心想。

They couldn't do anything more about that though.

尽管如此，他们对此也无能为力。

Soon though, they had run into a slight problem. The car was running low on gas. After driving for four hours yesterday, it was expected that they would have to refuel. How would they manage that if they didn't have any money though? Neither of them had thought to grab any since it had seemed completely worthless.

然而不久，他们就遇到了一个小问题。汽车油量不足了。昨天连续开了四个小时的车，预计到需要加油。但如果他们没有钱，这该怎么办呢？两人都没想过要带些钱，因为当时看来那完全无用。

Eventually Asuka stopped the car and parked it in the middle of the street they were currently on. This section of the city was better off than the others they had seen so far. Small shops lined the sides and what appeared to be the remains of trees stood on the edges of the sidewalks. Street lights that once lit the street up were now dead and dull. Shinji felt that this was a rather nice place when humans had still lived here.

最终，明日香停下了车，将它停在当前所在街道的中央。这座城市的这一区域比他们迄今所见的大多数地方都要好些。小店铺沿街排列，人行道边缘似乎还残留着树木的遗迹。曾经照亮街道的路灯如今已熄灭，显得黯淡无光。真嗣觉得，在人类还居住于此的时候，这里曾是一个相当不错的地方。

Getting out of the car, Asuka walked to the front of it and sat down on the hood. Shinji waited several seconds before he followed suit, though he stood beside her instead.

下了车，明日香走到车前，坐在了引擎盖上。真嗣等了几秒才跟着照做，不过他选择站在她旁边。

"What are we gonna do about the fuel?" asked Asuka. "I can't just keep driving around looking for a gas station while we slowly whittle away our fuel."

"燃料怎么办？" 明日香问道。"我不能就这样一直开着车找加油站，同时慢慢消耗我们的燃料。"

"These stores must have a cash register. We could break one open and grab whatever we need."

"这些商店肯定有收银机。我们可以撬开一个，拿我们需要的东西。"

"I never thought that money would have value again."

"我从没想过钱还会有价值。"

"Neither did I," replied Shinji.

“我也没有，”真嗣回答道。

They both stayed like that for a while, Shinji standing beside her and Asuka sitting on the hood of the car. The road in front of them seemed to stretch onward for eternity. It was sorta like their own path that they followed.

他们就这样待了一会儿，真嗣站在她旁边，明日香坐在车前盖上。他们面前的道路似乎无限延伸。这有点像他们所追随的自己的道路。

A breeze, suddenly coming up from the ocean passed before them. The sun wasn't as bad as it had been in Tokyo-3, but the breeze was still refreshing. It calmed them both.

突然，一阵从海上吹来的微风拂过他们。太阳不像在第三新东京市那么强烈，但微风依然令人神清气爽。它让两人都平静了下来。

"Its almost sad when you think of how many people used to occupy this street every day."

“想想这条街每天曾有多少人往来，几乎有些悲哀。”

Shinji looked over at Asuka as she said this, surprised at the tone in her voice. Her features weren't hard or angry; she was genuinely sad.

真嗣看向明日香，她说话的语气让他感到惊讶。她的表情并不严厉或愤怒；她是真的感到悲伤。

The breeze continued playing across their face, wiping around their hair.

微风继续拂过他们的脸庞，轻绕着他们的发丝。

"C'mon," said Shinji suddenly. "We should hurry up and find the money so we can get out of here."

“快点，”真嗣突然说道，“我们得赶紧找到钱，然后离开这里。”

"Yeah," mumbled Asuka as the breeze died out.

“嗯，”明日香咕哝着，随着微风停息。

They checked many of the stores along the street, but it wasn't until the seventh one that they found a cash register. Getting it open though was easier said then done. They tried bashing it against the sidewalk, light poles, and Asuka even kicked it at one point. Though this didn't do anything except make her even more angry. Eventually, Shinji got the idea of prying it open with one of the knives he had grabbed back in Tokyo-3. It took him several minutes of adjusting the knife to different angels before he was able pry the register open. The register had plenty of cash within it, enough to last them a while.

他们检查了街上许多店铺，但直到第七家才找到一台收银机。然而，打开它说起来容易做起来难。他们尝试用它撞击人行道、路灯杆，甚至明日香还踢了一脚。但这除了让她更加生气外，什么也没做。最终，真嗣想到了用他在东京-3 拿的一把刀撬开它。他花了好几分钟调整刀的角度，才终于撬开了收银机。里面有足够的现金，足够他们用上一段时间。

Exiting the building, they walked back to the car and Asuka started it. Next, they only had to find a gas station.

走出大楼，他们步行回到车上，阿斯卡启动了引擎。接下来，他们只需找到一个加油站。

It didn't take them long either. After rounding a corner, Shinji spotted a gas station, and Asuka accelerated rather aggressively towards it. Parking the car, it took them several minutes before they realized that the gas station wasn't working. Without any source of electricity to power the pumps, the gasoline couldn't come up the pumps. Neither of them had even considered this problem.

他们也没花太多时间。转过一个拐角后，真嗣看到了一个加油站，阿斯卡相当猛烈地加速驶向那里。停好车后，他们花了好几分钟才意识到加油站并未运作。由于没有电力供应泵，汽油无法被抽上来。他们俩之前都没考虑到这个问题。

"Well this fucking sucks," grumbled Asuka after this realization. Shinji however had a sudden idea.

“这他妈真糟糕，”阿斯卡意识到后咕哝道。然而，真嗣突然有了个主意。

"What about siphoning the gas from other cars?" he asked.

“从其他车上抽油怎么样？”他问道。

"How the fuck would we go about doing that?" Asuka nearly shouted.

“我们他妈的怎么做到这一点？”明日香几乎喊了出来。

Shinji thought he had an idea for that, but without the proper item for it...

真嗣觉得自己有个主意，但没有合适的工具……

Looking over at the convenience store beside the gas station, he figured that it couldn't hurt his chances. Walking into the small building, he looked around for anything that might help him. He needed a hose that was see-through, something that he could watch the gas flowing into the tank. A gas can to hold extra would be preferable as well.

瞥了一眼加油站旁的便利店，他觉得这不会影响他的机会。走进这个小店，他四处寻找可能帮得上忙的东西。他需要一根透明的软管，这样他可以观察汽油流入油箱的过程。此外，一个能装额外汽油的油桶就更好了。

Walking down the few isles, Shinji didn't see anything useful. Though maybe in the back of the store...

在几排货架间漫步，真嗣没发现什么有用的东西。不过，或许在店铺的深处……

Opening the door and ignoring the 'employees only' sign, he started rummaging through things on shelves, in cabinets, and a supply closet. Just as he was about to give up though, he saw a small red machine pushed into the back of a corner. On further inspection, it seemed to be a pressure washer. Picking it up, he found what he was looking for. Underneath the pressure washer, was a plastic hose, coiled around itself. Grabbing it, he ignored the pressure washer and ran out to where Asuka was grumpily waiting.

推开门，无视那块“员工专用”的牌子，他开始在架子上、橱柜里以及储物间翻找起来。正当他准备放弃时，却在角落深处瞥见了一台被挤在后面的红色小机器。仔细一看，似乎是个高压清洗机。他拿起它，终于找到了目标。在高压清洗机下方，藏着一根塑料软管，自成一圈地盘绕着。他抓起软管，对高压清洗机视而不见，径直跑向正不耐烦等待的明日香。

"You seem excited," she said as he ran up to her.

"你看起来很兴奋，" 他跑到她面前时，她说道。

"I think we can siphon gas out of other cars with this," said Shinji.

"我觉得我们可以用这个从其他车里抽油，" 真嗣说道。

Asuka understood what he meant almost right away.

明日香几乎立刻就明白了他的意思。

"I'm surprised you thought of this instead of me," exclaimed Asuka in surprise.

"真没想到是你先想到这个而不是我，" 明日香惊讶地说道。

"Well, you were complaining a lot," mumbled Shinji.

"嗯，你一直在抱怨，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"What was that?" asked Asuka, her eyebrows slightly raised.

"那是什么？" 明日香微微挑起眉毛问道。

"Nothing," he replied hurriedly.

"没什么，" 他急忙回答。

They got back into the car, but didn't have to drive very far. The first car they spotted, Asuka pulled alongside it, getting as close as she could to the other cars gas tank. Getting out, they walked in between the two cars and unscrewed both of the caps to the gas tanks. Sticking one end of the clear hose into the other cars gas tank, Shinji hesitated for a brief instance.

他们重新上车，但没开多远。第一辆车映入眼帘时，明日香便靠了过去，尽可能贴近那辆车的油箱。下车后，他们走到两车之间，拧开了两辆车的油箱盖。将透明软管的一端插入对方车的油箱，真嗣犹豫了一瞬。

"Be sure not to drink any of this stuff, and I can already smell the fumes," said Asuka as she crinkled her nose.

“千万别喝这东西，我都能闻到气味了。”明日香皱着鼻子说。

"I know," said Shinji before he put the other end of the hose into his mouth and took a deep breath, sucking the gas into the hose. Almost immediately, he could see the yellow liquid shooting up into the hose. Clamping down on the end closest to his mouth, he waited until the liquid was almost to where his hand was clenching the tube before he stopped sucking. Being sure to not let any air travel into the hose, he quickly closed the hole on the end which had just left his mouth. Slowly, he brought the hose over to their own station wagons gas tank and carefully inserted the hose into the tank. Almost immediately, he heard the sound of the gas being emptied into their gas tank.

“我知道。”真嗣说着，将软管另一端放入口中，深吸一口气，将汽油吸进管子。几乎立刻，他看到黄色液体涌入软管。他紧闭靠近嘴的那端，直到液体快到他手握管子的地方才停止吸吮。确保不让空气进入软管，他迅速封住刚离开嘴的那端。慢慢地，他将软管移向他们自己的旅行车油箱，小心地插入。几乎立刻，他听到了汽油流入他们油箱的声音。

"Not bad," said Asuka, strangely praising him for what he had done. "It seems to work at least."

“不错嘛，”明日香出乎意料地称赞他，“至少看起来是有效的。”

"Thanks," said Shinji. "But I think we'll have to do this a few times until we have a full tank of gas."

“谢谢，”真嗣说道，“但我想我们得重复几次，直到油箱加满。”

After waiting until the gas had been completely siphoned, Shinji removed the tube from the gas tank, being sure to hold the section of the tube that hadn't been touched by the gasoline. He would have to clean the end of the tube later when they decided to siphon more fuel. For now though, he coiled the tube back up and placed it in a compartment beside the hatch of their car.

等到汽油完全被抽干后，真嗣从油箱中取出管子，确保握住那段未接触汽油的部分。稍后他们决定再抽油时，他得清洗管子末端。不过现在，他把管子卷起来放回车门旁的隔间里。

After everything that had had happened in the past few hours, Asuka and Shinji both agreed that lunch was in order. Shinji made it, with Asuka lending a helping hand occasionally. They had certainly become more friendly with each other. Helping each other was more natural to them, and especially Asuka, who seemed to have come to terms with how their lives were now. She seemed less prone at getting angry, and was more willing to assist Shinji in what he was doing. And she had to admit, that actually doing something felt better than sitting back and wasting away.

经历了过去几个小时的种种事情后，明日香和真嗣都认为该吃午饭了。真嗣动手做了饭，明日香偶尔帮忙。他们确实变得更加友好。互相帮助对他们来说更自然了，尤其是明日香，她似乎已经接受了现在的生活。她变得不那么容易生气，更愿意协助真嗣。她不得不承认，实际做点什么比坐以待毙感觉好多了。

Using the new utensils and bowls they had found in Tokyo-3, they enjoyed a rather good meal. Shinji was getting more used to cooking with canned food instead of fresh ingredients, and seemed to have found ways to improve the food. Asuka didn't think anybody could make canned food taste any better, but she was pleasantly surprised by the chili that Shinji had made.

使用在东京-3 新找到的餐具和碗，他们享用了一顿相当不错的餐食。真嗣越来越习惯用罐头食品而非新鲜食材来烹饪，似乎找到了提升食物口感的方法。明日香原本认为没人能让罐头食品变得更美味，但真嗣做的辣椒却让她惊喜不已。

"That almost seemed like a real lunch," said Asuka as she leaned back from where they sat together on the sidewalk.

“那顿饭几乎像是真的午餐了，”明日香说着，从他们一起坐在人行道上的位置向后靠了靠。

Not once, but twice in the same day, Asuka had praised him. Shinji was starting to wonder if she had a fever or something.

同一天内，明日香不止一次地称赞了他。真嗣开始怀疑她是不是发烧了还是怎么的。

"This isn't so bad I guess," said Asuka suddenly.

“我想这也不算太糟，”明日香突然说道。

Shinji looked sideways at her and saw that she was looking up at the sky.

真嗣斜眼瞥了她一眼，发现她正仰望着天空。

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Living like this...isn't that bad I guess. I was worried at first, about what the future would hold, but I'm not so worried about it anymore. I feel like I've already gotten used to this."

"这样生活...似乎也不坏。起初我还担心未来会怎样，但现在我不再那么担心了。我感觉自己已经习惯了这一切。"

"Well, there is still plenty ahead of us."

"嗯，前方还有许多未知等着我们呢。"

"Like what though?" asked Asuka. "I don't expect us to stay here in Tokyo-2 forever, but what else do we really have to worry about? There isn't anybody else here but us, that much is for certain."

“比如说呢？”明日香问道，“我并不指望我们永远待在东京-2，但我们还有什么好担心的呢？这里除了我们，确实没有其他人了。”

"Thats part of the problem," mumbled Shinji, almost inaudibly.

“那是问题的一部分，”真嗣咕哝着，几乎听不见。

"What did you say?" asked Asuka, puzzled.

“你说什么？”明日香困惑地问。

Shinji didn't know whether he wanted to bring this up. The only two people left alive on the entire planet; Adam and Eve. A silly thought certainly, but one that held merit. He didn't think of Asuka that way, but if they really were the only two people left alive, didn't they have a duty as humans?

真嗣不知道是否该提起这个话题。整个星球上仅存的两个人：亚当和夏娃。这想法虽然荒唐，但也不无道理。他并没有以那种方式看待明日香，但如果他们真的是地球上仅存的人类，他们是否有人类的责任呢？

"Asuka," started Shinji. "明日香," 真嗣开口道。

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Would you ever consider settling down?"

"你会考虑安定下来吗？"

"Settling down?" repeated Asuka like a parrot.

"安定下来？" 明日香像鹦鹉学舌般重复道。

"You know...staying in one place, a house or something...living together like that."

"你知道...待在一个地方，比如一栋房子里...像那样一起生活。"

"Huh?" replied Asuka. She felt speechless.

""啊？"" 明日香回答道。她感到无言以对。

"I don't mean right now or anything," replied Shinji hurriedly. "Its just that, wandering around constantly...it feels that eventually we'll have to stay in one place."

"我不是说现在或者别的什么，"" 真嗣急忙回答，""只是，一直在外漂泊...总觉得我们最终还是得找个地方安定下来。"

"Are you retarded?" replied Asuka. The sad thing is that she wasn't mocking him.

“你脑子有问题吗？”明日香反问道。可悲的是，她并非在嘲讽他。

"Why would I ever want to stay in a house with you? I still sometimes have trouble believing that I'm actually stuck with someone like you."

"我为什么要留在有你在的房子里？我有时还难以相信，自己居然得和像你这样的人纠缠在一起。"

"You're not exactly wonderful yourself," Shinji fired back.

"你自己也好不到哪儿去，" 真嗣回敬道。"

Asuka's mouth became a thin line then, as she radiated fury.

此时，明日香的嘴角紧抿成一条线，怒气四溢。

"You're insane," retorted Asuka.

"你疯了吧，" 明日香反驳道。

"I think its practical," replied Shinji.

"我觉得这很实际，" 真嗣回答。

"I think its stupid," said Asuka as she crossed her arms. She wasn't relenting.

"我觉得这很蠢，" 明日香交叉双臂说道。她毫不让步。

They sat like that for a while in silence, neither of them budging.

他们就这样静静地坐着，谁也没有动。

"I have to admit though," said Asuka after several minutes, "wandering around constantly, does feel rather pointless."

"不过我得承认，"阿斯卡几分钟后说道，"不停地四处游荡，确实感觉挺无意义的。"

"So you'll think about it?"

"那你考虑一下？"

"I never said anything about that," Asuka snapped back at him. "Living by myself though, thats certainly a possibility."

"我从没提过那件事，" 明日香对他厉声回道，"不过，独自生活确实是个可能的选择。"

Shinji didn't bother mentioning how counterproductive that would be.

真嗣没费心去提那会有多适得其反。

"Enough of this though," said Asuka as she stood up.

"够了，"明日香说着站起身来。

They packed everything back up into their bags and stored them into their car. Spending the next few hours, they siphoned as much fuel from other cars as they could until they had a full tank of gas. It had taken longer than Shinji had thought, since he had to clean the hose every time he used it. Asuka didn't offer to help him in this, and part of Shinji was glad that she didn't. He had a feeling that he wouldn't have let her.

他们将所有东西重新打包进背包，并存放在车上。接下来的几个小时里，他们尽可能从其他车辆中抽取燃油，直到油箱加满。这比真嗣预想的要久，因为他每次使用后都得清洗软管。明日香没有提出帮忙，而真嗣内心的一部分对此感到庆幸。他有种感觉，即使她提出，他也不会让她帮忙。

Afternoon was just beginning to set in at this point. Asuka drove them around for a while, inspecting building after building as they passed them. Some of these seemed to have been abandoned long before Third Impact had even happened. They stopped occasionally, and ventured into some of them. For the most part though, they didn't find anything valuable.

此时，午后才刚刚开始。明日香开车带着他们四处转悠，逐一检查经过的建筑物。其中一些似乎在第三次冲击发生之前就已经被遗弃了。他们偶尔会停下来，冒险进入其中一些建筑。但大多数情况下，他们并没有找到什么有价值的东西。

Driving down a long avenue, they seemed to be in more of a residential district now. Small house and apartment buildings of varying colors passed by them as they drove. Asuka remembered what Shinji had said during lunch as she watched the apartments zip by them. Choosing one place to live in seemed to be a tough choice, even if she was thinking seriously about it. Besides, they would eventually exhausted all the resources in the area and be forced to relocate. At least, this is how Asuka viewed it.

驾车沿着一条长长的林荫道行驶，他们似乎已经进入了住宅区。随着车辆前行，各式各样色彩斑斓的小屋和公寓楼从他们身边掠过。看着这些飞驰而过的公寓，明日香想起了真嗣午餐时说的话。选择一个居住地似乎是个艰难的决定，即便她正认真考虑此事。况且，他们终将耗尽该地区的所有资源，被迫再次搬迁。至少，在明日香看来是这样的。

Stop signs and street lights were barely noticed by either of them as they drove through intersections. Cars may have been backed up for miles at one point along this stretch of road. Not anymore though.

他们驾车穿过十字路口时，几乎没注意到停车标志和交通灯。曾经在这段路上，车辆可能排成长龙，绵延数英里。但现在不再是这样了。

Just as Shinji was wondering where they were going to stay for the night, Asuka jerked the car sharply, and jammed down on the brake. At first, Shinji thought that Asuka had swerved out of the way to avoid something, but then saw that her gaze was fixed on something. She had suddenly turned the corner and spotted something, something which Shinji was surprised to see in the derelict city of Tokyo-2.

正当真嗣在想他们晚上要在哪里过夜时，明日香突然猛地一打方向盘，用力踩下刹车。起初，真嗣以为明日香是为了避开什么东西而急转弯，但随后发现她的目光紧盯着某个东西。她突然转弯，发现了一些东西，一些真嗣在荒废的东京-2 市中感到意外的东西。

"Is that a park?" asked Shinji.

“那是个公园吗？”真嗣问道。

"I believe so," said Asuka as she sped towards it. She had certainly mastered the manual transmission already.

"我相信是的，" 明日香一边说着，一边加速向它驶去。她显然已经熟练掌握了手动挡。

"I'm surprise to see one."

"看到一个真是意外。"

"So am I, but with all the houses around, I can see why. Families must have lived in many of these houses."

"我也是，但考虑到周围的房屋，我能理解。许多房子里一定住着家庭。"

What she said made sense thought Shinji.

她的话让真嗣觉得有道理。

Asuka pulled into the parking lot and parked the car. They both got out, ignoring their backpacks for now. The park wasn't large compared to parks that the government maintained and had likely been built only for the surrounding community. The parking lot was perched on a hill overlooking the entirety of the park. Several fir trees were scattered along the park, providing shade. Underneath some of these, broken pieces of park benches could be seen scattered about. What appeared to be a soccer field lay further out in the park as well.

明日香驶入停车场，停好车。两人都下了车，暂时没管背包。与政府维护的大型公园相比，这个公园并不大，很可能是仅为周边社区而建的。停车场位于小山丘上，俯瞰整个公园。几棵冷杉散布在公园各处，提供阴凉。在这些树下，可以看到一些破损的公园长椅碎片散落一地。公园更远处似乎还有一个足球场。

Shinji and Asuka walked down the slanted slope and looked around them. It was too much to ask for a cherry blossom tree in this park, but Shinji could wish.

真嗣和明日香沿着倾斜的坡道走下去，环顾四周。在这个公园里，想要一棵樱花树未免太过奢望，但真嗣仍心存希望。

"It's oddly calm here," mumbled Asuka.

“这里出奇地安静，”明日香喃喃自语道。

She was right. Shinji had never noticed before, probably because they had been in the city this entire time, but he could distinctively hear the sound of birds chirping. He had never given too much thought to what animals remained on the planet before now. The park stretched outwards in front of them, not another building in sight. If he turned around though, he saw what remained of the skyline of Tokyo-2. This place definitely felt different then the darkened city behind them.

她说得对。真嗣以前从未注意到，可能是因为他们一直在这座城市里，但他现在能清晰地听到鸟儿鸣叫的声音。他以前从未过多考虑过地球上还剩下哪些动物。公园在他们面前延伸开来，视线中没有其他建筑。但如果他转过身，就能看到东京-2 的天际线残存的部分。这个地方确实与他们身后的昏暗城市感觉不同。

"I think we're staying here tonight," said Shinji.

"我想我们今晚就留在这里，"真嗣说。

"Agreed," nodded Asuka. "Though I'll be sleeping in the car."

"同意，"明日香点头道，"不过我会在车里睡觉。"

"Suit yourself," replied Shinji. He couldn't understand why she would want to do this as he himself would rather sleep under the stars.

"随你吧，" 真嗣回答道。他不明白为什么她会想这么做，他自己倒是宁愿在星空下睡觉。

Asuka however was rather surprised that he didn't complain about this, as she would have thought sleeping in the front seat had rather irritated him. But Shinji didn't say anything more on the subject

然而，明日香相当惊讶他对此没有抱怨，她本以为在前座睡觉会让他相当恼火。但真嗣没有再就这个话题多说什么。

They walked around the park for a while, letting the remaining daylight fade away. Shinji grabbed whatever spare pieces of wood that remained from the park benches and piled them together in the open field. He waited until the sun was just barely visible, peaking over the horizon until he lit the fire.

他们在公园里漫步了一会儿，任由残留的日光渐渐消逝。真嗣捡起公园长椅上剩下的零散木块，在空地上堆成一堆。他一直等到太阳几乎完全沉没，只在天际线上露出微弱的光芒时，才点燃了火堆。

Dinner was more subdued than the lunch they had had earlier in the day and significantly less appealing. To keep their supplies from diminishing too quickly, Shinji decided that he would make one large meal everyday. Other than that though, the rest weren't very fulfilling.

晚餐比他们当天早些时候吃的午餐要沉闷得多，也明显不那么诱人。为了不让物资消耗得太快，真嗣决定每天只做一顿大餐。除此之外，其他餐食都不太令人满足。

After Asuka had finished she announced to Shinji that she was heading back to the car to sleep.

吃完饭后，明日香向真嗣宣布她要回车里睡觉了。

"I'm going back to the car," said Asuka as she stood up.

"我要回车上了。"明日香说着站起身来。

"Okay," said Shinji without looking at her as he stroked the fire.

“好吧，”真嗣没有看她，一边抚摸着火堆一边说。

Asuka watched him, hesitant about asking him something.

明日香看着他，犹豫着是否要问他些什么。

"Are going to sleep in the front seat again?" she asked eventually.

“你又要睡在副驾驶座上了吗？”她最终问道。

"No. I'm going to stay out here I think," said Shinji, looking at her this time. "Looking at the stars again like I did on the beach in Tokyo-3...I guess I miss that. Plus its more comfortable on the grass then in the car anyway."

“不，我想我还是待在外面吧，”真嗣这次看着她说，“像在东京-3 的海滩上那样再次仰望星空……我想我有点怀念那种感觉。而且无论如何，草地上也比车里舒服。”

"I suppose," mumbled Asuka as she turned away from him. She wondered though, if he was angry about being forced to sleep in the passenger seat last night. It wasn't like she had been rude about it or anything.

“我想也是，”明日香咕哝着，转过身去不再看他。不过她心里却在想，他是不是因为昨晚被迫睡在副驾驶座上而生气。她并没有对此表现得无礼或什么的。

'Whatever,' thought Asuka.

“随便吧，”明日香心想。

Shinji barely even noticed as Asuka left to go and sleep in the car. He was enjoying himself at the moment, just being out there. As long as he didn't look behind him, the thought of the city disappeared from his mind. It had been different in Tokyo-3, as the city had seemed like something that had been essential at the time. There wasn't anything useful on the beach, and the only thing to look at was the ocean. Here though, even in the faint moonlight and roaring fire, he could still see signs of birds flying overhead. It was much more peaceful here than Tokyo-3 had been, and he was wondering if all animals that had been in the city during Third Impact had been wiped out.

真嗣几乎没注意到明日香离开去车上睡觉。此刻他正享受着，仅仅是在那里就感到愉悦。只要他不回头看，城市的念头就从脑海中消失了。在第三新东京市时情况不同，那座城市在当时似乎是必不可少的。海滩上没有什么有用的东西，唯一能看的只有大海。然而在这里，即使在微弱的月光和熊熊篝火下，他仍能看到鸟儿飞过的痕迹。这里比第三新东京市宁静得多，他不禁思考，在第三次冲击期间，城市中的所有动物是否都被消灭了。

His mind wandered back to when he was staying in this city for those brief few days. As he had told Asuka, he didn't wander outside the hotel he was staying at. He never had any intention of doing something like that. He almost wished that he had now, if only to know more about the city.

他的思绪飘回到了在这座城市短暂停留的那几天。正如他告诉明日香的那样，他从未离开过自己下榻的酒店。他从未有过那样的打算。他几乎希望自己当时能出去走走，哪怕只是为了多了解这座城市。

He wondered what life would have been like back in Tokyo-3 if none of this had never happened. If what Asuka had said was correct, then he may have potentially found himself as an Evangelion pilot. It seemed true that his father had brought him to Tokyo-3 for a reason, and the Evangelions seemed the most likely reason. It was odd though when he thought about it...that he would have likely worked alongside Asuka.

他不禁思索，如果这一切从未发生，他在东京-3 的生活会是怎样。如果明日香所言非虚，那么他或许有可能成为一名 EVA 驾驶员。看来，父亲带他来东京-3 确实有其原因，而 EVA 似乎是最有可能的答案。但当他细想时，又觉得奇怪...他很可能会与明日香并肩作战。

This puzzled him, as a coincidence such as that seemed strange. He was sure Asuka had thought of it herself, but the fact that two very unlikely people have been forced to work together, that may have worked together anyways if things hadn't turned out like they had. Shinji wasn't a believer in a higher being by any means, but he had to admit that something was off about that.

这让他感到困惑，因为这样的巧合似乎有些奇怪。他确信明日香是自己想到的，但两个原本不太可能合作的人被迫一起工作，如果不是事情发展成这样，他们也许还是会合作。真嗣并不相信有什么更高的存在，但他不得不承认这其中有些不对劲。

He threw more wood onto the fire as he thought about all this. His life could have turned out so differently. Musing over it all though, he realized that his relationship with Asuka would have likely ended up the same as it was currently. Maybe a little differently since they were forced to agree on certain things. The arguing and bickering would have still been there certainly.

他一边想着这些，一边往火堆里添了些木柴。他的生活本可以完全不同。尽管如此，他意识到他与明日香的关系很可能还是会像现在这样。也许会有些不同，因为他们被迫在一些事情上达成一致。争吵和斗嘴肯定还是会有的。

Deciding that he may as well try to go to sleep, Shinji laid his sleeping down beside the fire. Stamping out the fire, Shinji rolled onto his back and closed his eyes. He didn't feel very tired, but he would prefer sleeping instead of just laying there thinking.

决定还是尝试入睡，真嗣在火堆旁铺好睡袋。他踩灭火焰，翻身躺下，闭上了眼睛。他并不觉得很困，但他宁愿睡觉也不想只是躺在那里思考。

Minutes passed by, and just as Shinji was dozing off, a noise woke him. It sounded like a snake at first, something slithering across the ground. The noise was too pronounced to be coming from a snake however.

时间一分一秒地过去，就在真嗣快要打瞌睡时，一阵声响将他惊醒。起初听起来像是一条蛇，有什么东西在地面上滑行。但这声音太过明显，不可能是蛇发出的。

"You still awake?" asked Asuka from just outside Shinji's vision.

“你还没睡吗？”明日香的声音从真嗣视线之外传来。

"Oh...its just you," sighed Shinji.

“哦……原来是你，”真嗣叹了口气。

"Whats that supposed to mean?"

"那是什么意思？"

"Nothing...what are you doing out here?" asked Shinji.

"没什么...你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道。"

It took Asuka several seconds to reply.

Asuka 过了好几秒才回答。

"Couldn't sleep in the car," she said eventually.

"在车上睡不着，"她最终说道。

As she came closer to Shinji, he realized that the slithering sound he had heard earlier had been Asuka's sleeping bag. She was dragging it behind herself. Throwing the sleeping bag down on the grass, Asuka lay down on it and looked up towards the sky..

当她走近真嗣时，他意识到之前听到的沙沙声是明日香睡袋发出的。她正拖着它在身后。明日香将睡袋扔在草地上，躺了上去，抬头望向天空。

'Well, it is probably more comfortable sleeping out here anyway,' thought Shinji as he looked upwards as well.

'嗯，在外面睡可能更舒服些，'真嗣想着，也抬头望向天空。

Seconds later, what Asuka said seemed to reaffirm what he had thought.

几秒钟后，明日香的话似乎证实了他之前的想法。

"You had a point I think, that sleeping out here is more enjoyable. The car is fine if we don't have anywhere else to sleep, but I would prefer sleeping like this if I could."

"我想你说的有道理，睡在这里确实更享受。如果没有别的地方可睡，车里也行，但如果可以的话，我更喜欢这样睡。"

"Yeah," mumbled Shinji, hardly listening to her.

"嗯，" 真嗣咕哝着，几乎没在听她说话。

"Hey, you're not mad are you?" asked Asuka.

"嘿，你没生气吧？" 明日香问道。

"No. Why would I be?"

"没有。我为什么要生气？"

"Last night...well, when I more or less forced you to sleep in the front seat."

"昨晚……呃，当我或多或少强迫你睡在副驾驶座上的时候。"

"I wouldn't say I was mad, maybe annoyed a little, but it wasn't that big of a deal. Did you think I was?"

"我不会说我生气了，可能有点烦吧，但也没那么严重。你觉得我会吗？"

"...Whatever, forget it." said Asuka in a low voice. She felt stupid thinking that Shinji could have gotten mad over something so insignificant.

"...随便了，忘了吧。" 明日香低声说道。她觉得自己真傻，竟然以为真嗣会为这么点小事生气。

Asuka fell asleep rather quickly after that, her face still turned towards Shinji. Finding it rather difficult to fall asleep while staring at Asuka's sleeping face, Shinji turned away from her. Considering they were on good terms right now, Shinji didn't want Asuka to get angry if she caught him staring at her face.

那之后，明日香很快就睡着了，脸还朝着真嗣。真嗣发现自己很难在盯着明日香的睡脸时入睡，于是转过身去。考虑到他们现在关系不错，真嗣不想让明日香因为发现他在盯着她的脸而生气。

Stars seemed to blink at them as they slept under the stars, forgetting for a brief moment the forgotten city that lay behind them.

繁星仿佛在向他们眨眼，他们躺在星空下入眠，短暂地忘却了身后那座被遗忘的城市。

The park they had designated as there new place to live at for the time being. Even though it was a good distance away from anything important, they enjoyed the place so much that they intended to stay there. Along with the park, they stayed in the more suburban area's of the city, deciding to ignore downtown Tokyo-2.

他们选定了这座公园作为暂时栖身之地，尽管它远离一切重要地点，但他们对这里喜爱有加，打算留下来。除了公园，他们还住在城市的郊区地带，决定不去理会东京-2 的市中心。

They found a grocery store after driving around early that morning, and raided as much food as they could. With the added supply, Shinji didn't have to worry as much about dwindling supplies.

那天清晨一大早，他们开车转悠后找到了一家杂货店，尽可能多地搜刮了食物。有了这些额外的补给，真嗣不必再过多担心物资日渐减少的问题。

At first, they were hesitant about checking houses for supplies, but Asuka had persuaded Shinji. As she had said, if the owners no longer exist, then they hardly need any of their things. It was rather harsh, albeit true. And so, after raiding several houses, they found a slew of new supplies including a new tent that they pitched out in the open field. Shinji was glad that it was large enough for both of them, easily accommodating two other people if needed. Besides these supplies, Shinji found a map as well, covering a very detailed portion of Tokyo-2 and Japan. He was glad that had found this now, as it was something he had always been on the look out for.

起初，他们对搜查房屋获取补给心存犹豫，但明日香说服了真嗣。正如她所说，如果屋主已不复存在，那么他们几乎不需要任何东西。这虽然严酷，却是事实。于是，在洗劫了几处房屋后，他们找到了一大批新补给，包括一顶新帐篷，他们将其搭在了空旷的田野上。真嗣很高兴它足够大，足以容纳他们两人，如果有需要，还能轻松容纳另外两个人。除了这些补给，真嗣还找到了一张地图，详细覆盖了东京-2 和日本的部分地区。他很庆幸现在找到了这个，因为这是他一直在寻找的东西。

Resting briefly in the park, they ate a hurried lunch and got back on the road, driving around and looking for more things. Asuka complained that she needed a bath, but as Shinji pointed out, it was very unlikely that they would find any place that had electricity. She had already gathered a few personal supplies for herself, including a comb, several towels, shampoo, and hairbands for tying her hair in a ponytail. She was already wearing one of these, her hair fluttering behind her in the wind as she drove. It was much longer then it had been, and Asuka had started complaining that it was getting in her way. Shinji was sorta glad that she hadn't cut it, even though he wouldn't admit it.

在公园短暂休息后，他们匆匆吃了午餐便重新上路，四处寻找更多的事物。明日香抱怨说她需要洗澡，但正如真嗣所指出的，他们很难找到有电的地方。她已经为自己收集了一些个人用品，包括梳子、几条毛巾、洗发水和扎马尾用的发带。她已经戴了一个在头上，长发随风飘扬，当她开车时。她的头发比以前长了许多，明日香开始抱怨它碍事。真嗣有点庆幸她没剪掉，尽管他不会承认。

They stopped in more houses and apartment, neither finding anything useful and still no electricity.

他们在更多的房屋和公寓中停留，却一无所获，电力依旧中断。

"If I don't have a bath soon I'm just going to clean myself with the water that we've got," complained Asuka.

"如果我再不洗澡，我就只能用现有的水简单擦洗一下了。"明日香抱怨道。

"If you do that, we'll be all out of water," replied Shinji.

"如果你这么做，我们的水就全用光了。" 真嗣回答道。

"I know that!" she snapped back at him.

"我知道！" 她厉声回敬他。

Shinji didn't honestly expect her to use their water supply to wash herself. She was simply complaining.

真嗣其实并不真的认为她会用他们的水来洗澡。她只是在发牢骚罢了。

That was when the rain came.

就在那时，雨来了。

It hit them all at once. One moment, the skies were clear, and the next, grey clouds rolled in and the downpour started. They hurriedly rolled their windows up and stopped the car in the middle of the road. Shinji was surprised by this, and was surprised further when Asuka jumped out of the car and laughed as she looked up to the sky. The sound was thunderous as the droplets fell around them. Shinji could only imagine this is what machine gun fire sounded like.

它突然间倾泻而下。前一刻天空还晴朗无云，下一刻灰云翻滚，暴雨骤至。他们急忙把车窗摇上，停在路中央。真嗣对此感到惊讶，更惊讶的是明日香跳出车外，仰望天空放声大笑。雨滴如雷鸣般坠落四周，真嗣只能想象这大概就是机枪扫射的声音。

Asuka seemed to be enjoying the sudden downpour, and compared to the last time it had rained, she was in much higher spirits. Even Shinji had to admit that this was a nice change of pace. Quickly, their clothes were soaked through completely, even though they didn't seem to care. Asuka even took this chance to wash her hair properly, using the shampoo that she had recently acquired. Shinji was content enough to lean against the car, enjoying the rain as it hit his face.

明日香似乎很享受这场突如其来的暴雨，与上次下雨时相比，她的心情明显好了许多。就连真嗣也不得不承认，这是个不错的节奏变化。很快，他们的衣服就完全湿透了，尽管他们似乎并不在意。明日香甚至趁机好好洗了洗头发，用上了她最近新买的洗发水。真嗣则心满意足地靠在车上，享受着雨水打在脸上的感觉。

Scrubbing her hair thoroughly, Asuka ran her hands through it, attempting to straighten it more. Her hair wasn't sleek as it used to be, but simply hung behind her hair, complete with all the sweat and grime that had accumulated there. She felt disgusting, even though it hadn't been that many days since she had swam in the Geofront.

阿斯卡用力搓洗着头发，双手来回梳理，试图将其拉直。她的头发已不再像从前那样光滑，只是随意地垂在脑后，沾满了汗水和污垢。她感到恶心，尽管距离上次在 Geofront 游泳并没有过去多少天。

It had been a while since she had thought about Nerv, but it was a brief passing moment. She found that the thought didn't weigh on her mind like it used to. That part of her life was long gone.

她已经有一段时间没有想起 Nerv 了，那只是一闪而过的念头。她发现这个想法不再像以前那样沉重地压在心头。那段生活早已远去。

Washing away the shampoo from her hair, Asuka walked over to Shinji who was still leaning against the car.

冲洗掉头发上的洗发水后，阿斯卡走向仍然靠在车上的真嗣。

"Satisfied?" asked Shinji as she approached him.

"满意了吗？" 真嗣在她走近时问道。

"More than that, I feel more refreshed then I have in a long time," sighed Asuka in relief.

"何止满意，我感觉比很久以来都更神清气爽，" 明日香松了口气叹道。

Shinji looked over her, noticing the beads of water that still clung to her brilliantly colored hair. The sight was rather mesmerizing, and he could even smell the shampoo she used from where he stood.

真嗣打量着她，注意到她那绚丽发色上仍挂着的水珠。这一幕颇为迷人，他甚至能从站立之处嗅到她所用洗发水的香气。

"Ready?" asked Asuka. “准备好了吗？”明日香问道。

"Yeah," nodded Shinji. “嗯，”真嗣点头道。

They got back in their car, and Asuka spent several minutes drying her hair with a towel. Shinji had acquired several for himself, but it had taken Asuka several more minutes to dry her hair. She combed it afterwards, straightening it as best she could before tying it back up in a ponytail. Shinji was just wondering how much longer they would be waiting when Asuka put the car in gear and they drove off, the rain still falling around them.

他们回到车上，绫波花了好几分钟用毛巾擦干头发。真嗣自己也拿了好几条毛巾，但绫波又花了更多时间才把头发擦干。她随后梳理头发，尽可能把它弄直，然后重新扎成马尾。真嗣正纳闷他们还要等多久，绫波就挂上档，他们开车离去，雨依旧在他们周围下着。

Asuka was noticeably more cautious as she drove, since this was the first time she was driving in the rain. As usual with her however, she quickly got the hang of it, and they were speeding back to their camp.

绫波开车时明显更加谨慎，因为这是她第一次在雨中驾驶。不过，像往常一样，她很快就掌握了窍门，他们加速返回营地。

The initial euphoria of the rain had worn off, and now it was starting to become rather annoying. When the got back to their camp, it was apparent that getting a fire started was impossible. Vacating to the tent instead, they passed the daylight hours away, hoping that the rain would stop so that they could have dinner. Asuka had found herself a book while going through the houses and was now reading that, while Shinji was listening to a cassette tape that he found. It wasn't the normal thing that he used to listen to on his S-DAT, but it was better than listening to the rain hitting their tent.

起初对雨的兴奋感已经消退，现在开始变得相当烦人。当他们回到营地时，显然生火是不可能了。于是他们转而躲进帐篷，打发白天的时光，希望雨能停下以便他们能吃上晚饭。明日香在翻找房子时找到了一本书，现在正读着它，而真嗣则在听一盘他找到的磁带。这不是他通常用 S-DAT 听的那种，但总比听雨打在帐篷上的声音要好。

It wasn't until 10 p.m. when the rain relented long enough for Shinji to get a fire started. Even with that though, it took him several tries since he was working with wet wood. He had to remember to store those in the tent or car to prevent something like this happening again.

直到晚上 10 点，雨才短暂停歇，让真嗣得以生起火来。尽管如此，由于他使用的是湿木头，还是尝试了好几次才成功。他得记住把这些木头存放在帐篷或车里，以防再次发生这种情况。

With both of them less enthusiastic as they had initially been about the rain, they ate the warm dinner in silence. Shinji had made miso soup with white rice; a standard japanese meal. Afterwards, the rain started again. Shinji was started to suspect something, and it wasn't until after he packed the pots and bowl away that he told Asuka.

随着两人对雨的热情不如最初，他们默默地吃着热腾腾的晚餐。真嗣做了味噌汤配白米饭；这是一顿标准的日本料理。饭后，雨又开始下了。真嗣开始怀疑起什么，直到他收拾好锅碗瓢盆后，才告诉明日香。

"I think this may be monsoon season that we're in," he said.

"我想我们正处在季风季节，"他说。

Asuka looked up from the book she was reading. She was laying on her back with a flashlight beside her, shining light onto the pages of the book.

明日香从正在阅读的书中抬起头来。她仰面躺着，旁边放着一支手电筒，将光线投射在书页上。

"What makes you say that?" she asked.

"你怎么会这么想？" 她问道。

"The sudden downpour of rain. Twice now we've seen this happen. I don't think it could be a coincidence."

"这突如其来的大雨。我们已经见过两次了。我觉得这不可能是巧合。"

"What about it then?" "那又如何呢？"

"Well, monsoon season usually happens between the months of May and September."

"嗯，季风季节通常发生在五月到九月之间。"

"So its one of those months?"

"所以是其中某个月？"

"Yes, but don't forget that we've been living like this for a month, maybe two. Its difficult to tell day to day sometimes. If we take the day that we arrived in Tokyo-3 though..."

"是的，但别忘了我们已经这样生活了一个月，也许是两个月。有时候很难分辨每天的不同。如果我们从到达东京-3 的那天算起的话……"

Asuka understood what he meant by this.

明日香明白他这话的意思。

"I got here at the beginning of May," said Asuka.

“我是五月初来到这里的，”明日香说道。

"And myself, a week after that. So the month is likely mid June or early July."

“而我，比他晚一周。所以现在大概是六月中旬或七月初。”

Thunder rolled overhead as they talked, and talking ceased for a moment. They had forgotten about the rain pounding against their tent, and the cold was starting to seep in. It had to be getting close to midnight by now.

头顶雷声隆隆，他们的谈话也为之一顿。他们已忘记了雨点敲打帐篷的声音，寒意开始渗入。此刻想必已近午夜。

"We should probably go to sleep," said Shinji, abandoning the previous conversation.

"我们或许该睡了，" 真嗣放弃了之前的对话。

They both got in their respective sleeping bags, but sleep would not come easily. The thunder continued overhead and the rain continued lashing against their tent. The cold was starting to become unbearable, and Shinji, who had always been resilient to the cold, was even starting to feel cold. He couldn't imagine what Asuka was feeling right now.

他们各自钻进了睡袋，但入睡并不容易。雷声依旧在头顶轰鸣，雨水不断拍打在帐篷上。寒冷开始变得难以忍受，就连一向耐寒的真嗣也开始感到冷。他无法想象明日香现在的感受。

"You still awake over there?" asked Shinji.

"你那边还醒着吗？" 真嗣问道。

"What do you think?" came the reply. "Its fucking freezing."

“你觉得呢？”对方回答，“冷得要命。”

Shinji almost laughed at Asuka's sarcastic humor.

真嗣差点被明日香那讽刺的幽默逗笑。

They were sleeping on complete opposite sides of the tent, curled up into a ball and trying to ignore the cold, but both of them found this difficult.

他们各自蜷缩在帐篷的两端，试图无视寒冷，但两人都觉得这很难做到。

"Hey...Asuka?" asked Shinji suddenly.

"嘿...明日香？" 真嗣突然问道。

"What? And don't you dare suggest we sleep together!"

"什么？你敢提议我们睡在一起！"

It was amazing how stubborn she could still be even when they were both freezing.

令人惊叹的是，即便两人都冻得要命，她依然能如此固执。

"I wasn't," came Shinji's hurried reply. "Only...sleeping so far apart...if we slept back to back-"

"我没有，" 真嗣急忙回答，"只是...睡得这么远...如果我们背靠背睡-"

"Still disgusting!" "还是恶心！"

'Stupid girl,' thought Shinji briefly.

“笨女孩，”真嗣短暂地想道。

"The sleeping bag will still be between us. There wont be any skin to skin contact."

"睡袋还是会放在我们之间。不会有肌肤接触的。"

Shinji thought that he heard Asuka's sharp intake of breath as he said this. He had made up his mind however, even if she hadn't. Still laying in his sleeping bag, he got up, and on his knees crawled to the middle of the tent and laid back down. Asuka had heard this, and at first thought that he was making his way over to where she lay.

碇真嗣觉得他说这话时听到了明日香急促的吸气声。然而，他已经下定决心，即使她没有。他依旧躺在睡袋里，起身跪着爬到帐篷中央，然后再次躺下。明日香听到了这些动静，起初以为他是朝她躺的地方爬来。

'If he seriously lays down next to me, I swear I'm gonna kick him in the balls,' thought Asuka. He stopped of course in the middle of the tent.

'如果他真敢躺在我旁边，我发誓我会踢他裤裆，'明日香心想。当然，他在帐篷中间停了下来。

They didn't say another word to each other for a long time. Asuka eventually turned towards Shinji and saw that he was facing away from her, his body curled inside the sleeping bag.

他们很长一段时间都没有再对彼此说一句话。明日香最终转向真嗣，发现他背对着她，身体蜷缩在睡袋里。

'Am I seriously considering this?' wondered Asuka. She was freezing, but it would certainly be warmer if they at least slept back to back. Question was, would she rather freeze instead of sleeping beside Shinji?

“我真的在考虑这个吗？”明日香心想。她冷得发抖，但如果他们至少背靠背睡，肯定会暖和些。问题是，她宁愿冻着也不愿睡在真嗣旁边吗？

'Damn it,' thought Asuka.

“该死，”明日香暗想。

Getting up on her knees, doing much the same as Shinji had done earlier, she crawled over to where he lay. She sat there on her knees for several seconds. Even though he didn't say anything, she didn't believe for one moment that he had fallen asleep.

她跪起身来，做着和真嗣之前差不多的动作，爬到他躺着的地方。她跪在那里几秒钟。尽管他什么也没说，但她一刻也不相信他已经睡着了。

Steeling herself for something, she made a one second decision before she threw herself down next to him, her back pressed against his. It was warmer, that much was for certain, and yet, comforting at the same time.

她为自己鼓了鼓劲，在一秒钟内做出了决定，然后扑倒在他身边，背紧贴着他的背。确实更暖和了，这一点毋庸置疑，同时也有种安慰的感觉。

"Asu-"

"Don't say anything," Asuka said quickly as she cut Shinji off. "Don't say another word. I don't want to hear anything about this, for the rest of the night or tomorrow. This is a one time thing, so get that straight. Got it?"

“什么都别说，”明日香迅速打断真嗣，“别再说一个字。今晚或明天，我什么都不想听。这只是一次性的，你得明白这一点。明白了吗？”

Even though her head wasn't against his, she could still tell that he was nodding.

尽管她的头没有靠在他身上，但她仍能感觉到他在点头。

'This sucks,' thought Asuka, her face turning red. Though whether from the sudden warmth, or embarrassment, she didn't know.

'这太糟糕了，'明日香心想，她的脸变得通红。虽然她不确定这是因为突如其来的温暖，还是因为尴尬。

With the added warmth, they fell asleep leaning against each other.

随着额外的温暖，他们依偎着彼此睡着了。

As was the norm, Shinji was the first to wake up the next morning, and he was glad that he did. If it had been Asuka, he probably would have been woken with a knee in his stomach. Sometime during the night, they had obviously turned over, so that both of their faces were practically inches apart. Shinji didn't want to think of the possibilities that could have happened while both of them were fast asleep.

按照惯例，真嗣是第二天早上第一个醒来的，他很庆幸这一点。如果是明日香的话，他大概会被她用膝盖顶在肚子上叫醒。夜里不知何时，他们显然翻了个身，以至于两人的脸几乎只有几英寸的距离。真嗣不想去想在他们熟睡时可能发生的那些事情。

Ignoring Asuka's face with her pink lips, he turned away from her and sat up, making as little noise as possible. The first thing he noticed was that the sound of rain pounding their tent had stopped. At least that was something to be happy about.

他无视明日香粉嫩的嘴唇，转过身去，尽可能轻地坐了起来。他首先注意到的是，雨点敲打帐篷的声音已经停止了。至少这是件值得高兴的事。

Unzipping the tent, he got his shoes on and walked out into the fresh air. The grass was still wet from the rain and water seemed to have collected at the top of their tent. The sun was already high in the sky and Shinji had to assume it was already midmorning. They had of course been up late last night, so sleeping in wasn't too surprising. Stretching, Shinji decided that he may as well prepare breakfast.

拉开帐篷的拉链，他穿上鞋子，走进清新的空气中。草地仍然因为雨水而湿漉漉的，帐篷顶上似乎积聚了一些水。太阳已经高高挂在天空，真嗣推测现在已经是上午中段了。他们昨晚当然睡得很晚，所以睡过头并不奇怪。伸展了一下身体，真嗣决定还是准备早餐吧。

The wood he retrieved from inside the tent was damp and cold, but not overly wet and getting the flame to catch wasn't difficult. It was at this point that he heard a groan from inside the tent and then a rather loud yell.

他从帐篷里取出的木头潮湿而冰冷，但并不十分湿透，点燃火焰并不困难。就在这时，他听到帐篷内传来一声呻吟，紧接着是一声相当响亮的喊叫。

Asuka's head darted out into the sunlight to stare at Shinji.

明日香的头猛地探出阳光下，盯着真嗣。

"What," he replied back under her stare.

“什么，”他回瞪着她，回应道。

"Why was I turned towards your sleeping bag!?"

“为什么我会转向你的睡袋！？”

Shinji felt his stomach plummet; he hadn't thought of that.

真嗣感到胃部一沉；他没想到这一点。

"No clue," he said, trying to feign ignorance.

“不知道，”他说，试图装作无知。

"You're lying," Asuka replied back.

“你在撒谎，”明日香回道。

"Does it really matter though?" Shinji complained.

"不过这真的重要吗？" 真嗣抱怨道。

"To you, maybe not. To me, of course."

"对你来说，可能不重要。对我来说，当然重要。

"Its not like its bad that we were facing each other while sleeping," shrugged Shinji, trying to get the worst of it over.

"我们睡觉时面对面，这也没什么不好的，" 真嗣耸耸肩，试图尽快把最糟糕的部分说出来。

Asuka seemed to think differently however, because she grabbed the closed thing she could find and threw it at Shinji, which happened to be one of her shoes. Shinji skillfully dodged it, and it landed on the ground behind him. They stared at each for several seconds after this, neither seeming to give any ground.

然而，明日香似乎有不同的想法，因为她抓起手边最近的东西——一只鞋子——朝真嗣扔去。真嗣灵巧地躲开了，鞋子落在了他身后的地上。两人在这之后对视了几秒钟，谁也没有退让的意思。

"Get my shoe," started Asuka.

"把我的鞋拿来，"明日香开口道。

"Get it yourself. You threw it at me afterall."

"自己拿去。毕竟是你扔给我的。"

Asuka sneered at him before she stood up and walked out of the tent, walking with only one shoe on. Grabbing her shoe off the grass, she walked back to the tent, slapping Shinji on the back with her shoe as she did so.

明日香对他嗤之以鼻，然后站起来，只穿着一只鞋走出了帐篷。她从草地上捡起鞋子，走回帐篷，一边走一边用鞋子拍了拍真嗣的背。

"Well, whats for breakfast?"

"那么，早餐吃什么？"

"Same as what we had for dinner."

"和昨晚的晚餐一样。"

Asuka didn't seem pleased by this.

明日香对此似乎并不满意。

"Damn it...what I wouldn't give for eggs, bacon, and some toast."

"该死……要是能吃上鸡蛋、培根和吐司就好了。"

"Complain all you want, but miso soup and rice is something that we have plenty of."

"尽管抱怨吧，但我们有的是味噌汤和米饭。"

"I'm sick of Japanese food."

"我吃腻了日本料理。"

"Well guess what? We're in Japan."

"那你猜怎么着？我们现在可是在日本。"

"Don't remind me," said Asuka as she sat down in front of the tent. Even though she complained, she still ate breakfast.

"别提醒我，"明日香说着，在帐篷前坐下。尽管她抱怨，但还是吃了早餐。

"So, what are we doing today?" asked Asuka without much purpose.

“那么，我们今天做什么？”明日香漫不经心地问道。

"Not sure," said Shinji. He didn't know really. What else did they need to survive? The grocery store had sufficient food to last them for a long time if they stayed here indefinitely. Though the park was nice, staying there forever was unlikely. Shinji had the map of Japan as well now. He wouldn't mind driving somewhere that wasn't a city if he was honest. He didn't have any idea where this may be though. Running it by Asuka right now though wasn't a good idea.

“不确定，”真嗣说。他真的不知道。他们还需要什么才能生存呢？如果他们无限期地留在这里，杂货店的食物足够他们吃很久。虽然公园不错，但永远待在那里是不可能的。真嗣现在也有了日本的地图。老实说，他不介意开车去一个不是城市的地方。但他也不知道这可能是哪里。不过，现在和明日香商量这个主意并不是个好时机。

"Hmm...well, whatever. If there is anything particular that you want to find, just let me know."

“嗯……好吧，无所谓。如果你有特别想找的东西，尽管告诉我。”

"What are you gonna be doing?"

“你打算做什么？”

"Reading," said Asuka simply as she walked back into the tent.

“看书，”明日香简单地回答，一边走回帐篷。

Shinji didn't know that Asuka enjoyed reading as much as she seemed to. More than likely, it was just something to kill time though.

真嗣不知道明日香原来这么喜欢阅读。很可能，这只是她用来打发时间的方式罢了。

With Asuka in her own world now, Shinji fell into his own, putting his earbuds into his ears and tuning out the world. He lay down on the hill overlooking the park. From here, he could see far away hills outside the city limits of Tokyo-2. Over that hill, he wondered what lay beyond it. He didn't think he'd ever have a chance to find out though.

随着明日香沉浸在自己的世界里，真嗣也陷入了自己的世界，他将耳塞塞进耳朵，隔绝了外界的声音。他躺在俯瞰公园的小山上。从这里，他可以看到东京-2 市界外遥远的山丘。越过那座山丘，他不知道那里还有什么。尽管他觉得可能永远没有机会去发现。

The entire world was so vast, and they had almost an infinite amount of time to discover it. At the very least, the entirety of Japan could probably be covered by them. Would they find something at all though Shinji wondered? Unlikely, though it may be worth it. He would wait though to bring this up with Asuka. They had just arrived in Tokyo-2, and it wasn't as though they were in a hurry.

整个世界如此广阔，他们几乎有无限的时间去探索。至少，整个日本可能都能被他们覆盖。但真嗣想知道，他们会找到什么吗？不太可能，尽管这可能值得一试。他会等到和明日香提起这件事。他们刚到东京-2，并不是说他们很着急。

At this thought, Shinji lightly dozed off, music still playing in his ears.

想到这里，真嗣轻轻地打起了盹，音乐仍在耳边播放。

A short time after this, Asuka stuck her head out to ask Shinji something. The question though was momentarily forgotten as she saw him laying on the hill overlooking the park. Walking towards him, she peered down at his sleeping face for several seconds before she stood up and with a slight smile thought-

不久之后，明日香探出头来想问真嗣些什么。然而，当她看到他正躺在俯瞰公园的小山坡上时，问题便暂时被遗忘了。她走向他，低头凝视着他熟睡的脸庞几秒钟，然后站起身来，嘴角微微上扬，心中暗想——

'There. Payback from when you saw me sleeping.'

好了，这是你看到我睡觉时的回报。

He may be an annoying idiot most of the time, but at least he had his moments.

他大多数时候可能是个烦人的傻瓜，但至少也有他的闪光时刻。

Walking back down the hill, Asuka entered the tent and further engrossed herself in her book.

走下山坡，明日香进入帐篷，更加沉浸在自己的书中。

Something I want to clarify really quickly. When Shinji was talking about the monsoon season, keep in mind that that was how he perceived what month they are in. Not necessarily what month they actually are in. Might be a bit confusing, but I myself had to stop and think about that for a bit as I wrote it.

有些事情我想快速澄清一下。当真嗣谈论季风季节时，记住那是他感知到的他们所处的月份。不一定就是实际的月份。可能有点令人困惑，但我在写作时自己也得停下来思考一会儿。

### Chapter 10: Realization

Feel like I'm on a role lately. Got a lot in this chapter so just enjoy it I guess.

感觉最近状态不错。chapter里收获颇丰，尽情享受吧，我想。

---

It was around noon that same day, when Asuka had gotten tired of reading that she decided to wake Shinji who was still sleeping on the hill overlooking the park. The sun was shining brightly in the sky right now, and Asuka was getting sick of sitting around. Walking over to Shinji, who's eyes were still closed, she stared down at him for several seconds, before she rolled him over using her foot. Almost immediately he sat upright.

那天中午时分，明日香读累了，决定叫醒还在小山坡上俯瞰公园熟睡的碇真嗣。阳光此刻正灿烂地照耀着天空，明日香已经厌倦了闲坐。她走到眼睛还闭着的真嗣身边，盯着他看了几秒钟，然后用脚把他翻了个身。他几乎立刻就坐了起来。

"Wha?" he started groggily, still apparently tired.

"什...什么？" 他迷迷糊糊地开口，显然还带着困意。

"I'm taking the car out," stated Asuka.

"我要开车出去，" 明日香宣布道。

"What for?" "去干什么？"

"Bored," she replied "无聊，" 她回答道

With this, Shinji decided to follow Asuka on this meaningless drive. Leaving the majority of their things behind, they only took a few water bottles, and started on their way.

于是，真嗣决定陪着明日香进行这次毫无意义的驾车之旅。他们留下了大部分物品，只带了几瓶水，便踏上了旅程。

In reality, they had hardly explored much of the surrounding area, or any of downtown Tokyo-2. The city was large, though not quite as large at Tokyo-3, but exploring it would still take time. Since Asuka was bored, she decided to do this. Sure, it was a good idea to know what the layout of the city was like, but more than that, she was simply bored.

实际上，他们几乎没有探索过周边地区，也没有去过第二新东京市区的任何地方。这座城市虽然不如第三新东京市那么大，但要探索它仍然需要时间。既然明日香感到无聊，她便决定这么做。当然，了解城市的布局是个好主意，但更重要的是，她只是觉得无聊。

There first stop was the beaches of Tokyo-2, or what was left of it. As they had noticed before, the sea-levels all around the city had risen because of Third Impact. The coastal area was now deep underwater and pushing inwards. Shinji thought he remembered reading somewhere that the foundation of Tokyo-2 had been built on very unstable land. It may have been that, that made half the city sink into the ocean.

他们的第一站是东京-2 的海滩，或者说，是它残存的部分。正如之前所注意到的，由于第三次冲击，整个城市周围的海平面都上升了。沿海地区如今已深陷水下，并向内陆推进。真嗣记得曾在某处读到过，东京-2 的地基建立在极不稳定的土地上。或许正是这一点，导致了半个城市沉入海洋。

They were only able to drive so far until they hit a dead end where the water was in front of them. They weren't in the downtown district, but even so, they had reached a point where they could go no further. An assortment of junk floated in the murky water, likely from the surrounding buildings. The tops of cars could clearly been seen floating in the water. Shinji thought it looked like something straight out of a disaster movie.

他们只能行驶到一定距离，直到前方水域成为死路。他们并不在市中心区域，但即便如此，也已经到达了一个无法再前进的点。混浊的水面上漂浮着各种垃圾，很可能是来自周围的建筑物。清晰可见的汽车顶部在水面上漂浮。真嗣觉得这景象简直就像是从灾难电影中直接搬出来的。

Leaving this gloomy scene, they drove back inwards, using highways to navigate around. Shinji was as well looking at the map while Asuka drove. He was starting to get an idea of the different districts within the city. If he wasn't mistaken, they were passing through what once had been a popular shopping area. They passed signs and billboards, advertising everything from soft drinks, to woman's hair products. He made a note of this area, thinking that they could use it to hunt for supplies.

离开这片阴郁的景象后，他们驾车向内陆返回，利用高速公路绕行。真嗣一边看着地图，一边由明日香驾驶。他开始对城市内的不同区域有了大致的了解。如果他没记错的话，他们正经过曾经繁华的购物区。他们经过了许多广告牌和招牌，宣传着从软饮料到女性护发产品的一切。他记下了这个地方，想着或许可以用来搜寻补给品。

As they continued driving, Asuka had a place she wanted to check out in particular. It was an odd choice Shinji thought after she had suggested, but he had to admit that it would be interesting.

随着继续行驶，明日香特别想去一个地方查看。真嗣觉得她的选择有些奇怪，但也不得不承认那会很有趣。

What Asuka suggested was that they check out the capital of Japan, since it was placed within Tokyo-2. Scouring through the map, Shinji found where the district was that housed the capital building, and Asuka drove them on their way.

明日香提议他们去日本的首都看看，因为它位于东京-2 区域内。两人仔细研究地图，找到了容纳首都大楼的区域，随后由明日香驾车前往。

They were still several miles away. Asuka kept on having to change roads as they kept running into cars that had pilled up. Swinging around a corner, Asuka darted around cars as she drove down what had once been a busy street. They had to pass through downtown first before they reached the capital. Shinji had his head resting against the passenger side door, the wind hitting him in the face. Asuka was driving rather fast for simply wanting to see the capital.

他们还相距数英里。明日香不得不一再改道，因为他们不断遇到堆积如山的汽车。在一个拐角处急转，明日香穿梭于车辆之间，沿着曾经繁忙的街道疾驰。他们必须先穿过市中心，才能到达首都。真嗣的头靠在乘客座车门上，风迎面吹来。明日香为了仅仅想看看首都而开得相当快。

Exiting the downtown district, they reached the capital district. The buildings around them no doubt held high seats of power at one point, each of the provinces within Japan having a seat there. It was a democracy, though Shinji wondered how much political power Nerv had had within the government.

离开市中心区域，他们抵达了首都区。周围的建筑无疑曾在某个时期是日本各省份的高权力所在地。这是一个民主国家，尽管真嗣好奇 NERV 在政府中拥有多少政治权力。

The architecture had hints of western influence in them. Some buildings had massive marble pillars that shown from the front of the building, the suns light reflecting off the columns. The majority of the buildings were modern however.

这些建筑带有西方影响的痕迹。有些建筑拥有宏伟的大理石柱，阳光从柱子上反射出来。然而，大多数建筑都是现代风格的。

Within this district, there was the distinct attempt to make the capital at least seem pleasant, even if the rest of the city was depressing. Flower gardens lined the sidewalks on either side of the road, and giant lawns that were no doubt kept clean and cut peppered the landscape surrounding the seats of democratic power. As they continued to drive, they even passed several cherry blossom trees.

在这个区域内，明显有着让首都至少看起来宜人的努力，即便城市的其他部分令人沮丧。道路两旁的人行道上排列着花坛，围绕着民主权力中心的景观中点缀着无疑保持清洁修剪整齐的巨大草坪。随着他们继续行驶，他们甚至经过了好几棵樱花树。

Slowly, looming in front of them, they started to see the capital of Japan. It didn't have the marble pillars like some of the other buildings, but the exterior of the building seemed to be made entirely out of marble. They parked the car on a street directly adjacent to the capital building. A lawn, which had been well groomed at one point, stretched out in front of them. An interweaving path crisscrossed around the length of the lawn, a fountain standing in the middle of it. The fountain, was of course no longer able to spew water. Along the very edges of the lawn stood hedges, higher than they should have been, lining the entire lawn.

慢慢地，在他们面前开始显现出日本的国会大厦。它没有其他建筑那样的石柱，但建筑的外墙似乎完全由大理石构成。他们将车停在了紧邻国会大厦的街道上。一片曾经精心打理过的草坪展现在他们面前。一条交织的小径横贯草坪的长度，中间矗立着一座喷泉。当然，这座喷泉已无法再喷水。草坪的边缘竖立着本不应如此高的灌木丛，环绕着整个草坪。

Taking all this in, Shinji and Asuka starting walking on the entwining path leading to the capital. They walked side by side, arms nearly brushing against each other. Though Shinji thought that all this was interesting, he couldn't help but feel Asuka had a reason for coming here.

将这一切尽收眼底，真嗣和明日香开始沿着通往首都的蜿蜒小径并肩前行，两人的手臂几乎要触碰到彼此。尽管真嗣觉得这一切颇为有趣，但他不禁感到明日香来到这里定有她的缘由。

"Asuka, how come you wanted to come here?" asked Shinji as they continued walking along the path.

"明日香，你怎么会想来这里的？" 他们沿着小路继续前行，真嗣问道。

"Just curious about something."

"只是对某件事感到好奇。"

"And you think its here?"

"你觉得它在这里吗？"

"This seemed like the easiest place to affirm it," she nodded.

“这里似乎是最容易确认的地方，”她点头道。

He didn't have a clue as to what she was talking about, but he didn't pursue the conversation.

他完全不知道她在说什么，但他没有继续追问对话。

They reached the end of he walkway, and started climbing the steps to the front of the building. There were many steps, and Shinji didn't even try counting them all. The building towered in front of them, filling their entire eyes. It seemed to be in a stable condition at least.

他们走到了步道的尽头，开始攀登通往建筑物正面的台阶。台阶很多，真嗣甚至没有尝试去数它们。建筑物在他们面前巍然耸立，填满了他们的视野。至少看起来结构还算稳固。

"Come on," said Asuka as she opened the door.

“快点，”明日香说着打开了门。

They passed through the first door, and opened a second door, leading them into a wide hall. The floor was made of granite, stretching out to the very end of the hall. The ceiling rose high above them made out of the same marble as the exterior of the building. At the center of the hall was a large, circular desk, made out of oak wood. Walking up to it, Shinji placed his hand on the surface and was surprised at how smooth it was.

他们穿过第一扇门，又打开第二扇门，进入了一个宽敞的大厅。地面由花岗岩铺成，一直延伸到大厅的尽头。天花板高耸，与建筑外部的白色大理石相同材质。大厅中央设有一张巨大的圆形办公桌，由橡木制成。走近桌子，真嗣将手放在桌面上，惊讶于它的光滑程度。

"This was likely the front desk," said Asuka as she looked over the side of the desk. Papers were strewn across the floor along with a desk lamp that had been smashed.

“这可能是前台，”明日香边说边从桌子侧面望去。地上散落着文件和一盏被砸坏的台灯。

"Its larger than I expected," said Shinji as he looked around the wide hall.

“比我想象的还要大，”真嗣环顾着宽敞的大厅说道。

"I don't see how you're surprised," replied Asuka. "The building itself is large, and this is the capital of Japan we're talking about."

"我不明白你为什么惊讶，"明日香回答道。"这栋建筑本身就很大，而且我们说的是日本的中心。"

"Did you ever go the capital in Germany?"

"你在德国去过首都吗？"

"Berlin? Yeah, I went there a few times. It was for Nerv though. This place though, its not quite as large as Berlin's capital building."

"柏林？是的，我去过几次。但那是为了 Nerv 的任务。不过这里，它没有柏林的国会大厦那么大。"

Shinji had trouble imagining that. Asuka was however already starting to walk away. She was walking further down the hallway. Hurrying to keep up with her, Shinji matched pace with her until they reached something which looked like a metal detector.

真嗣很难想象这一点。然而，明日香已经开始走开了。她沿着走廊越走越远。真嗣急忙跟上，与她并肩而行，直到他们来到一个看起来像金属探测器的东西前。

"Security checkpoint," mumbled Asuka. Of course, with no electricity, the scanner wouldn't go off.

“安检点。”明日香咕哝道。当然，没有电，扫描仪是不会响的。

Walking calmly through it, Asuka paused as she looked at the station beside the metal detector. A desk and chair sat there, and a glass panel covered both the front and side of it.

镇定自若地穿过这里，明日香在金属探测器旁的站台前停下脚步。一张桌子和椅子摆在那里，前面和侧面都覆盖着玻璃面板。

"A guard probably sat here," said Asuka as she opened one of the desk drawers.

“这里大概坐着一名警卫，”明日香说着，打开了其中一个抽屉。

"Is that bulletproof glass then?" asked Shinji, pointing to the glass panel in front of him.

“那是防弹玻璃吗？” 真嗣指着面前的玻璃面板问道。

"Course," replied Asuka. "Security was taken seriously here after all."

“当然，”明日香回答，“毕竟这里的安全措施一直很严格。”

"What are you looking for then?"

“那你到底在找什么？”

"A gun," said Asuka simply.

“一把枪，”明日香简单地说。

This response rather shocked Shinji. He had never thought of acquiring a gun in this After Impact world. But what Asuka said made sense. A certain amount of protection was probably necessary.

这个回答让真嗣颇为震惊。他从未想过在这个后冲击世界里获取一把枪。但明日香的话不无道理。一定的自我保护或许是必要的。

"You know how to use one?" Shinji asked her.

“你会用吗？” 真嗣问她。

"I received some basic combat training since I was an Evangelion pilot. Though I've only fired a gun a couple of times, and only on a gun range."

"我作为 EVA 驾驶员接受了一些基础战斗训练。虽然我只开过几次枪，而且都是在射击场上。"

This girl just kept on surprising him thought Shinji. He sometimes forgot how lucky he was to be stuck with Asuka. She would whine and complain about thinks often, but she had a certain knowledge of things which was invaluable.

这个女孩总是让他感到惊喜，真嗣心想。他有时会忘记自己有多幸运能和明日香在一起。她常常会抱怨和发牢骚，但她对某些事情的了解却是无价之宝。

"Nothing," said Asuka as she gave up her search. "Though there will be other checkpoints to search for one."

“没什么，”明日香放弃了搜索，说道，“不过还有其他检查点可以寻找。”

"Is this what you wanted to look for?"

“这就是你想找的东西吗？”

"No. It only crossed my mind when I saw the security checkpoint. I thought it would be handy to have one, in case of an emergency."

"不，只是在看到安检口时突然想到的。我觉得有个这东西在紧急情况下会很方便。"

"What is it you're looking for then?" asked Shinji.

"那你到底在找什么呢？" 真嗣问道。"

Asuka didn't immediately reply as they continued walking down the hall. They passed by several elevator shafts, none of which they could use of course. They accessed an emergency stairwell however, and started climbing up. It was then that Asuka told him what she was looking for.

他们继续沿着走廊走，明日香没有立即回答。他们经过了几部电梯，当然都不能使用。不过他们找到了一个紧急楼梯间，开始向上爬。就在这时，明日香告诉了他她在找什么。

"Shinji, you know yesterday when you talked about the monsoon thing."

"真嗣，你记得昨天你提到季风的事情吗？"

"What about it?" "那又怎样？"

"I'm not sure if your guess of the month is accurate."

"我不确定你猜测的月份是否准确。"

"How so?" "怎么会这样？"

"First, its based on the weather, which is of course just a guess that we're in monsoon season."

"首先，这是基于天气的推测，当然，我们只是猜测现在正处于雨季。"

"Yes, but you can't deny that we both remember being in Tokyo-3 in May before all this happened, nor that it has been almost two months since we woke up on the beach of Tokyo-3."

"是的，但你不能否认我们都记得在这一切发生之前，五月份曾在第三新东京市，而且自从我们在第三新东京市的海滩上醒来已经快两个月了。"

"Yes, but there is something that you didn't factor in. Why is it that we can't remember anything that happened during Third Impact. Something of that scale, we surely should have remembered something. Why was it that I was in my plug suit when I woke up? Why were none of the Evangelions in Dogma when we checked? Why was it, that two people who had never met before, find themselves suddenly having to live with each other. Might I add that we could both have very well worked alongside each other as Evangelion pilots."

"是的，但你忽略了一个因素。为什么我们无法记住第三次冲击期间发生的任何事情？那样大规模的事件，我们理应记得些什么。为什么我醒来时穿着插入栓服？为什么我们检查时发现所有 EVA 都不在禁令中？为什么两个从未谋面的人突然要一起生活？我还要补充一点，我们俩完全有可能作为 EVA 驾驶员并肩作战。"

"You believe that then? That I might have become one."

"你真的相信吗？我可能已经变成了那样。"

"I'm positive that you could have...or maybe were."

"我确信你可能已经……或者曾经是。"

This statement shocked Shinji, but Asuka had her face set on what she was explaining.

这句话让真嗣震惊，但明日香的脸色坚定，专注于她正在解释的内容。

"I have no doubt that your father brought you to Tokyo-3 to become the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01. That seems a given. I just don't know if you really became one, or not. From what I remember hearing from the staff when I was still working at Nerv in Germany, a pilot suited for Unit 01 hadn't been found, although the director, your father, had somebody in mind. I think that was likely you."

“我毫不怀疑你父亲带你来东京-3 是为了让你成为 EVA 初号机的驾驶员。这似乎是显而易见的。我只是不确定你是否真的成为了驾驶员。根据我在德国 Nerv 工作时从工作人员那里听到的，尽管指挥官，也就是你父亲，心中有人选，但适合初号机的驾驶员还未找到。我想那个人很可能就是你。”

"What you said before though Asuka...that I might have been one. I can't remember at all...so how does that-"

“不过，你之前说的，明日香……我可能曾经是其中一员。我完全记不起来了……所以那到底是怎么回事——”

"That was the other problem with your guess about the date. Our memories are not right. There is a problem between the period of both of us arriving in Tokyo-3, and then when we woke up on the beach."

"那就是你猜测日期的另一个问题。我们的记忆不准确。在我们两人抵达第三新东京市的时间段，以及后来我们在海滩上醒来的时间之间，存在一个记忆断层。"

"Wouldn't it just be a week or something that we can't remember?"

"难道不就是一周左右的时间我们记不起来了吗？"

"I don't know long it was, and thats what makes me worried."

"我不清楚具体有多久，正是这一点让我感到担忧。"

It was true, Asuka had a pained look on her face. She was currently unsure about a lot of things.

确实如此，明日香脸上带着痛苦的表情。她现在对很多事情都感到不确定。

"At the very least, Unit 01 should still have been in Dogma, but it wasn't. If you were the designated pilot, then it makes sense to think that something happened within that time period, and you piloted it for some reason. As for myself...well I can guess that I was there with you, the First Child as well."

"至少，01 号机应该还在中央教条区，但它不在那里。如果你是指定的驾驶员，那么可以推测在那段时间内发生了某些事情，你出于某种原因驾驶了它。至于我自己...嗯，我猜我和你在一起，作为第一适格者。"

"What was her name again?"

"她叫什么名字来着？"

"Rei. Ayanami Rei," Asuka said slightly bitter. Shinji could tell that the thought of the person annoyed her.

"绫波零。" 明日香带着些许苦涩地说道。真嗣能感觉到这个名字让她感到不快。

"So all three of us, me, you, and Ayanami fought...or something."

"这么说，我们三个，我、你还有绫波，一起战斗过……或者类似的事情。"

"I don't know," said Asuka as she bit her lips. "I'm just speculating about something which may or may not be true. Either way though, what I'm looking for in here should at least let us know how big of a gap there is in our memories."

"我不知道，" 明日香咬着嘴唇说道，"我只是猜测一些可能真实也可能不真实的事情。无论如何，我在这里寻找的东西至少能让我们知道记忆中存在多大的空白。"

"What...is it like a calendar or something?"

"什么...是像日历之类的东西吗？"

"No, thats not specific enough, though that would help to continue remembering the days. What I'm looking for here is a newspaper. I was hoping to find one behind the front desk, or at the security checkpoint, but so far, nothing."

"不，那不够具体，虽然那有助于继续记住日子。我在这里寻找的是一份报纸。我原本希望在前台或安检处找到一份，但到目前为止，什么都没有。"

What she said left Shinji deep in thought. There was a lot that he hadn't considered, but Asuka had. It was true that they didn't know how long their memory loss was, but it couldn't be longer than a couple of weeks at the most.

她的话让真嗣陷入了沉思。有很多事情他未曾考虑过，但明日香却想到了。确实，他们不知道记忆丧失持续了多久，但最多也不过几周时间。

Reaching the top of the stairwell, Asuka opened the door and they stepped out into a small hallway. Offices with nameplates next the doors lined either side of them. Ignoring the names, Asuka opened the door closest to them and entered.

到达楼梯顶端，明日香打开门，他们走进一条狭窄的走廊。两侧的办公室门旁都挂着名牌。明日香没有理会那些名字，径直打开了离他们最近的门，走了进去。

The office was small, making Shinji think it wasn't somebody that important that had worked here. Asuka ruffled through the things on the desk, ignoring the computer, and other things that sat on the desk. Shinji couldn't help but notice a picture though of a woman with two boys on either side of her. The person that worked here must have had a family.

办公室很小，让真嗣觉得在这里工作的人应该不是什么重要人物。明日香在桌上的物品中翻找着，忽略了电脑和其他摆放在桌上的东西。真嗣不禁注意到一张照片，照片中是一位女士，两侧各站着一个男孩。在这里工作的人一定有个家庭。

'A family,' thought Shinji. It was something that he had never experienced, and from the sound of it, Asuka hadn't either.

‘一个家庭，’真嗣心想。这是他从未体验过的，从听起来看，明日香也没有。

"Doesn't anybody read a newspaper in this damn building?" wondered Asuka as she gave up her search of the office. She noticed that Shinji was staring though, and thought that he was looking at her, before she noticed his gaze was directed at the picture on the desk.

“这栋楼里没人看报纸吗？”明日香在办公室里放弃搜索时疑惑地想。她注意到真嗣在盯着她看，但随即发现他的目光其实落在桌上的照片上。

"This guy had a family," mumbled Shinji.

“这家伙有个家庭，”真嗣喃喃自语。

"Plenty of people did," replied Asuka. "At least there with each other, if you believe in that of course."

"很多人都是这样，" 明日香回答道，"至少在那里他们彼此相伴，当然，如果你相信这种事的话。"

Leaving the office, they walked to the one adjacent, but here they didn't find a newspaper either.

离开办公室后，他们走向隔壁的那间，但在这里他们也没有找到报纸。

"Is it possible that there isn't one here?" asked Shinji.

"这里会不会根本没有报纸？" 真嗣问道。

"Unless nobody in the entire building read one the day that Third Impact happened, I highly doubt that. Paper takes time to degrade, unless it gets damp somehow, and this building is in surprisingly good shape."

"除非整栋楼的人在第三次冲击发生那天都没读过报纸，否则我对此深表怀疑。纸张需要时间才能降解，除非它以某种方式受潮，而这栋建筑的状况出奇地好。"

Rounding a corner, they came upon another security checkpoint. This one was positioned for the people coming out of the elevator, giving it a double layer of security with this one and the one downstairs.

拐过一个弯，他们遇到了另一个安检点。这个安检点设在电梯出口处，与楼下的那个共同构成了双层安保。

Checking the drawers again, Asuka found at least one of the things she was looking for. In the topmost drawer was a 9mm handgun. Removing it from the drawer, Asuka examined it and checked the magazine. The magazine held several bullets, although none were loaded in the chamber of the gun. Looking through the drawer again, she found a small box, containing several more shells of ammo.

再次检查抽屉，明日香找到了至少一件她正在寻找的东西。在最上面的抽屉里有一把 9 毫米手枪。她从抽屉中取出它，检查了一下弹匣。弹匣里装着几颗子弹，尽管枪膛里没有装填。再次翻找抽屉，她发现了一个小盒子，里面装着更多的子弹。

"Here, hold onto this," said Asuka as she threw the box to Shinji. Catching it, Shinji stuffed it in one of his pockets. Asuka examined the gun again, before making sure the safety was flipped. She couldn't be certain it fired until she tried it, but firing it in here wasn't a wise idea. For now, she decided to stuff it behind her waist, tucking it into the jeans she was wearing.

“拿着这个，”明日香说着将盒子扔给了真嗣。真嗣接住后，把它塞进了自己的口袋里。明日香再次检查了手枪，然后确保保险已经打开。她不能确定它是否能开火，除非试一试，但在这里开枪可不是个明智的主意。目前，她决定把手枪塞在腰后，塞进她穿的牛仔裤里。

"Well, thats something at least," said Asuka.

“嗯，至少还有这个。”明日香说道。

Leaving the checkpoint, they examined more offices, still unable to find a newspaper that gave them an accurate idea of when Third Impact might have happened. Deciding to climb further up into the building, they returned to the stairwell. Reaching a landing that seemed to be the fourth floor, Asuka opened the door and stepped out onto the granite floor.

离开检查站后，他们继续检查了更多办公室，仍未能找到一份报纸来准确了解第三次冲击可能发生的时间。决定继续向上攀爬，他们回到了楼梯间。到达一个看似是四楼的楼层，明日香打开门，踏上了花岗岩地板。

This hallway was smaller than the other two, but seemed to be more important as well. Double oak doors stood on the opposite end of where the elevators came from. Standing before them, Shinji looked to the plaque hanging on the wall. This seemed to be were the majority of the decisions came from within the government. Shinji wondered how many times Nerv had been brought up in the discussions that went on here.

这条走廊比前两条要窄，但似乎也更为重要。双扇橡木门位于电梯过来的另一端。站在门前，真嗣看向挂在墙上的铭牌。这里似乎是政府大部分决策的源头。真嗣好奇在这里的讨论中，NERV 被提及了多少次。

Opening the two doors, Shinji and Asuka were greeted by a wide open room. The room was circular, leading all the way down to the main floor. Rows and rows of desks covered the wall, starting from the top, and extended all the way down to the bottom. As Shinji looked closely, he could see nameplates on many of these desks. At the very center of the room was a platform, upon which was raised a podium and behind it several chairs.

推开两扇门，真嗣和明日香进入了一个宽敞的房间。房间呈圆形，一直延伸到主楼层。从顶部开始，一排排的办公桌沿着墙壁延伸到底部。真嗣仔细一看，发现许多桌子上都有名牌。房间正中央是一个平台，上面设有讲台和几把椅子。

Asuka and Shinji started walking down the isle until they reached the bottom. When Shinji looked up, he saw that a skylight hung far above him, letting sunlight come into the semi-dark room.

明日香和真嗣开始沿着过道往下走，直到到达底部。当真嗣抬头望去，他看到一个天窗高高悬挂在上方，让阳光照进半暗的房间。

Asuka walked over to one of the desks in the front row and examined the papers upon it. Most of them seemed to be government related. Ignoring this, Asuka continued going down the rows, searching for a newspaper that gave them a clue as to what date it had been before Third Impact. Shinji instead walked up to the platform in the center of the room and looked out. He couldn't imagine what it must have been when this thing was packed, having all those faces looking down on you, questioning you.

明日香走到前排的一张桌子旁，检查上面的文件。大部分似乎与政府相关。无视这些，明日香继续沿着一排排桌子寻找，希望能找到一份报纸，提供第三次冲击前日期的线索。真嗣则走向房间中央的讲台，向外望去。他无法想象当这里挤满人时会是什么样子，所有那些面孔都注视着你，质疑着你。

"Oi, Shinji!" “喂，真嗣！”

Shinji looked to one of the far corner of the room and saw Asuka standing there, waving at him. She seemed to be beckoning him to come over to where she was.

真嗣望向房间的远角，看到明日香站在那里，朝他挥手。她似乎在示意他过去她那边。

Taking the steps that led to Asuka two at a time, Shinji halted and walked down the row of desks until he was looking down at a piece of paper that Asuka had found. It wasn't a newspaper, but it did have a date on it.

真嗣两步并作一步地走上通往明日香的台阶，停下脚步，沿着一排排桌子走过去，直到他低头看着明日香找到的一张纸。这不是报纸，但它上面确实有日期。

The date read June 10th.

日期显示为 6 月 10 日。

Shinji looked at this date for several seconds. There wasn't a year, but it did specifically say the date. Glancing at it further, Shinji skimmed through the government document, picking out key words. Slowly, he began to realize what they were talking about. Words that referred to Nerv and the Evangelions jumped out at him. Reading further, there was the mention of the angels as well. Whats more, his father, Gendo Ikari was mentioned.

真嗣盯着这个日期看了好几秒。虽然没有年份，但确实明确标注了日期。他进一步瞥了一眼，快速浏览着政府文件，挑出关键词。渐渐地，他开始意识到他们在谈论什么。提到 NERV 和 EVA 的词汇跃入眼帘。继续阅读，还提到了使徒。更重要的是，他的父亲，碇源堂也被提及。

"What is this exactly?" asked Shinji.

“这究竟是什么？”真嗣问道。

"I can't be sure, but I think its a report on the activities of Nerv. Nerv was never technically part of the government of Japan, but acted on its own instead. I'm not surprised that the government would want to keep tabs on what was happening in Tokyo-3. The date though, isn't exactly what we wanted. Even if we go with your theory, the date can't be June 10th. That would have meant there were still people here while we were in Tokyo-3."

我不敢完全确定，但我觉得这是一份关于 Nerv 活动的报告。Nerv 从未正式隶属于日本政府，而是自行其是。政府想要密切关注第三新东京市发生的事情，我并不感到意外。不过，日期并不是我们期望的。即便采纳你的理论，日期也不可能是 6 月 10 日。那样的话，就意味着在我们身处第三新东京市期间，这里还有人在。

Shinji thought back to when they had been in the Geofront and all the dried blood they had seen.

真嗣回想起他们在地底空洞时的情景，以及所见到的所有干涸血迹。

"Keep looking around," continued Asuka. "Even if we don't find a newspaper here, this is at least a start. We have a date to go off of now."

"继续四处看看，"明日香接着说，"即使我们在这里找不到报纸，这至少是个开始。我们现在有了一个出发的日期。"

Shinji did so, following Asuka's advice and starting going from desk to desk, searching for any documents that had been dated. Slowly, they began to piece together dates from the month of June, all the way through August. The latest date they were able to find was August 21st. Some of the documents made mention of Nerv, though the majority referred to bills that were put forth.

按照明日香的建议，真嗣开始逐个桌子寻找，搜寻任何标有日期的文件。慢慢地，他们开始拼凑出从六月一直到八月的日期。他们找到的最晚日期是 8 月 21 日。一些文件提到了 NERV，但大多数涉及的是提出的账单。

They had already combed more than half the room and were now taking a break, sitting on the edge of the platform in the center of the grand room. Sipping water slowly, they didn't talk to each other. When they had found the document that had August 21st on it, they had been shocked. If the date on the document was correct, and there wasn't any reason why it wouldn't be, they were likely in the month of October by now. This had been a shock to both Shinji and Asuka. Almost three months of their memories simply didn't exist. Again, they couldn't be positive that this was even the final document.

他们已经仔细检查了房间的一半以上，现在正在休息，坐在大厅中央平台边缘。慢慢地喝着水，他们彼此没有交谈。当他们找到那份标有 8 月 21 日的文件时，两人都震惊了。如果文件上的日期是正确的，没有理由怀疑它，那么现在很可能已经是十月份了。这对真嗣和明日香来说都是一个巨大的打击。他们几乎三个月的记忆就这样消失了。而且，他们也不能确定这就是最后的文件。

Standing up again, they proceeded to search the rest of the room for more dates.

站起来后，他们继续在房间的其他部分寻找更多的日期。

They had no idea how long they had been inside the building, only that they were both incredibly hungry, and the sun was starting to set. Shinji was starting to wish that he had brought some food with them, but he didn't know they would be gone this long. The skylight that shown down wasn't giving them much light anymore either. If they wanted to read something, they were forced to go to the center of the room where the platform stood.

他们不知道在建筑物里待了多久，只知道两人都饿得不行，太阳也开始西沉。真嗣开始后悔没带些食物来，他没想到会离开这么久。从天窗透进的光线也变得微弱，如果想要阅读什么，他们不得不走到房间中央的平台处。

As they were considering on giving up, Asuka found a paper on a desk in a row in the very far corner of the room. Calling Shinji over to her, she handed him the piece of paper that she had found. It wasn't a document, but a scrawling of some sort done on an otherwise blank piece of paper, seemingly done by the person who had sat at the desk. The contents mentioned several things relevant to Nerv, and then there was the date mentioned. The date was September 2nd, and what followed was a brief mention of questionable activities within Nerv that were of concern to certain people. The brief note brought into question whether something would have to be done if Nerv went outside the limits the government had placed on them.

正当他们考虑放弃时，明日香在房间最远角落的一排桌子中发现了一张纸。她叫来真嗣，将找到的这张纸递给他。这不是一份文件，而是一张空白纸上的潦草涂鸦，似乎是坐在那张桌子前的人所留下的。内容提到了几件与 NERV 相关的事项，随后还提到了日期。日期是 9 月 2 日，紧接着简要提及了 NERV 内部令人担忧的可疑活动，这些活动引起了某些人的关注。这份简短的笔记让人质疑，如果 NERV 超出政府设定的界限，是否需要采取某些措施。

Shinji and Asuka both read this brief note several times before they looked at each other.

真嗣和明日香都反复读了几遍这张简短的字条，然后才相互对视。

"What does this mean?" asked Shinji.

“这是什么意思？”真嗣问道。

"Certain people within the government were afraid of Nerv, and wanted something done about it. Probably, what we saw in the Geofront was a direct result of those decisions. At least, this is my guess," said Asuka

“政府内部某些人对 NERV 感到恐惧，想要采取行动。很可能，我们在地底空洞看到的就是这些决策的直接后果。至少，这是我猜的，”明日香说。

"Then, the attack on Nerv would have happened in September," Shinji replied slowly.

“那么，对 NERV 的攻击应该发生在九月，”真嗣缓缓回答道。

"Yeah," said Asuka as she let the note fall back onto the desk.

“是啊，”明日香说着，让那张纸条重新落回桌上。

That would mean they were in late October or early November right now. The thought of this was impossible for Shinji or Asuka to comprehend. Almost four months, four months that they couldn't recall in the slightest.

这意味着现在已经是十月底或十一月初了。这个想法对真嗣和明日香来说难以置信。几乎四个月，四个月的时间他们丝毫没有记忆。

Asuka let herself sink into the chair in front of the desk, her eyes rather glazed over. Four months! She wanted to scream, wanted to break something. It was maddening, simply impossible!

明日香让自己沉入桌前的椅子，眼神有些呆滞。四个月！她想尖叫，想砸碎什么。这简直令人发狂，根本不可能！

"Is this enough?" asked Shinji.

“这样够了吗？”真嗣问道。

Shinji didn't want to think of this himself. The truth, if it was the truth, was too improbable. What was real and what wasn't? This entire time, had they been blindly walking around, not having a clue what had happened?

真嗣并不想自己思考这个问题。真相，如果那是真相的话，太过离奇。什么是真实的，什么又是虚幻的？这段时间以来，他们是否一直在盲目地徘徊，对发生的一切毫无头绪？

Asuka didn't reply to this question however; she was too stunned to reply. Shinji placed his hands on her shoulder and shook her however. He couldn't afford to have Asuka lose it right now.

然而，明日香没有回答这个问题；她太过震惊以至于无法回应。真嗣把手放在她的肩膀上摇了摇。他不能让明日香现在崩溃。

"Asuka!" he nearly shouted at her.

“明日香！”他几乎是对她喊道。

She blinked and turned her head towards him.

她眨了眨眼，转头看向他。

"Sorry," she said. Standing up, she tried not to look back down at the desk.

“对不起。”她说道。站起身来，她尽量不去看向那张桌子。

"Isn't this enough?" asked Shinji again.

"这样还不够吗？" 真嗣再次问道。

"For now," nodded Asuka. She was trying her best to keep calm. September 2nd...they didn't even know how many weeks followed that date. It could be another month.

"目前来说，" 明日香点头道。她正尽力保持冷静。9 月 2 日……他们甚至不知道那个日期之后还有多少周。可能又是一个月。

"We should leave, return to the park. I'll cook something and then we can go right to sleep."

"我们应该离开，回到公园去。我来煮点东西，然后我们可以直接睡觉。"

"Yeah," said Asuka shakily.

"嗯，" 明日香颤抖地说。

They hurriedly left the circular room and took the steps down to the ground floor two at a time. They wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

他们匆忙离开圆形房间，两步并作一步地跑下通往一楼的楼梯。他们想尽快离开。

Throwing open both sets of doors at the entrance to the capital, they walked out into the decreasing sunlight. As they reached the car that they had parked across the lawn, Shinji thought that Asuka would have difficulties driving. She didn't seem to have anything else more clear in her mind right now however. Shinji understood then, that she just wanted to get back to the park, to forget about what they had just read. If she was driving, at least her mind could focus on something. They didn't speak to each other as she drove.

推开首都入口处的两扇大门，他们走进了逐渐减弱的阳光中。当他们走到停在草坪对面的车旁时，真嗣觉得明日香开车会有困难。然而，她此刻似乎没有更清晰的想法。真嗣明白，她只是想回到公园，忘记刚刚读到的东西。如果她开车，至少她的思绪可以集中在某件事上。她开车时，他们没有交谈。

Asuka drove carefully as they made there way back, but it took them almost a full hour. The sun had almost completely set now, and when they returned to the park, it took Shinji a while before he started a fire. He wasn't physically tired, just mentally. He didn't want to think about the four months of his life that were missing.

明日香小心翼翼地驾驶着，他们返回的途中花费了近一个小时。此时太阳已几乎完全落下，当他们回到公园时，真嗣花了好一会儿才生起火来。他并非身体疲惫，而是心力交瘁。他不愿去想那消失的四个月生命。

Thinking that they needed something to raise their spirits, Shinji cooked a rather extravagant meal for what he had to work with. Sauteing several of the canned vegetables in a pan with soy sauce, he used this as a side dish. Cooking the rice separately, he added chicken broth, giving it a minute amount of extra flavor.

想着他们需要提振精神，真嗣用现有的食材做了一顿颇为丰盛的饭菜。他将几样罐头蔬菜用酱油在平底锅里炒了炒，作为配菜。米饭则单独煮制，加入鸡汤，赋予其一丝额外的风味。

Asuka didn't say anything as Shinji passed her the bowl of rice and vegetables, but ate vigorously. Again, anything that could occupy her mind right now she relished. Shinji found that cooking did that for himself at least, as driving had done the same for Asuka.

明日香接过真嗣递来的那碗米饭和蔬菜，一言不发，只是大口地吃着。此刻，任何能占据她思绪的事物她都倍感珍惜。真嗣发现烹饪至少能让自己分心，正如驾驶对明日香的作用一样。

After finishing, Asuka retreated into the tent and Shinji packed everything away. It couldn't have been later than eight o'clock by then, but even Shinji found himself wanting to sleep.

饭后，明日香回到帐篷里，真嗣则收拾好一切。那时应该还不到八点，但连真嗣自己都感到困意袭来。

Crawling into the tent as well, Shinji glanced over to the far corner where Asuka was laying. She was already in her sleeping bag, and had her back turned towards him. They hadn't spoken a word to each other since they had left the capital building.

真嗣也钻进帐篷，瞥了一眼远处的角落，明日香正躺在那里。她已经钻进了睡袋，背对着他。自从离开首都大楼后，他们之间就再未有过任何交流。

Shinji got into his own sleeping bag and moved to his own corner of the tent. Quickly though, he found that something was missing, lacking. Maybe it had been because of the events of the day, the realization that things may have happened that he knew nothing about. Last night though, Shinji and Asuka had slept unusually close to each other, because of the rain. Even without the rain though, Shinji found that he wished for that comfort again. They were in this together, and both were feeling the hurt from what they had found out.

真嗣钻进自己的睡袋，挪到了帐篷的一角。然而很快，他发现有些东西缺失了，感觉不对劲。或许是因为当天发生的事情，意识到有些事情可能已经发生而他一无所知。尽管如此，昨晚真嗣和明日香因为下雨而异常靠近地睡在一起。即便没有雨，真嗣发现自己还是渴望那种安慰。他们共同面对这一切，都感受到了所发现真相带来的痛苦。

Doing much the same as he had done the previous night, Shinji crawled to the middle of the tent and laid down. He didn't say a word to Asuka, but the meaning was there. 'I'm afraid just as you are.' If they couldn't find comfort in themselves, then they could find it together.

真嗣几乎和前一晚一样，爬到帐篷中央躺下。他没有对明日香说一句话，但意思已经传达出来了。‘我和你一样害怕。’如果他们无法自我安慰，那么就一起寻找慰藉。

Even quicker than last night, Shinji heard movement as Asuka got up, and moved to the middle of the tent. She laid down next to him, their backs against each other. She didn't say anything either, but accepted the unspoken words.

比昨晚更快，真嗣听到明日香起身，移到帐篷中央。她在他旁边躺下，背靠背。她也没有说什么，但接受了这份不言而喻的默契。

Neither of their lives were as they had seemed. Four months of their lives simply didn't exist. That time certainly existed though. So why couldn't they remember anything?

他们的生活都不再如表面那般。四个月的时间仿佛凭空消失。那段时间确实存在，可为何他们却记不起任何片段？

They both questioned this as they slowly fell asleep beside each other.

他们俩都对此心存疑问，慢慢地在彼此身旁入睡。

The birds chirping overhead was the start of the new day. It was still very early in the morning, and the sun wasn't even fully up yet when Shinji opened his eyes. He stared up at the tent for a long time, slowly remembering everything from yesterday. It wasn't as painful as it had been, but Shinji still had questions about a lot of things.

鸟儿在头顶啁啾，新的一天开始了。清晨尚早，太阳还未完全升起，真嗣便睁开了眼睛。他盯着帐篷看了许久，渐渐回忆起昨天的一切。虽然不再那么痛苦，但真嗣对许多事情仍存有疑问。

Looking to his left, he saw a small lump sleeping next to him, distinguished by strawberry colored hair. Asuka it seemed, was still sleeping, her breathing low and peaceful. At least she didn't have to deal with everything quite yet. Asuka had taken the shock of missing four months of her life rather hard it seemed.

他向左看去，只见一个娇小的身影依偎在旁，一头草莓色的头发格外显眼。看来明日香还在熟睡，呼吸平稳而宁静。至少她暂时不必面对这一切。明日香似乎对遗失了四个月的生活感到相当震惊。

Deciding that it was a little early to make breakfast, Shinji instead carefully removed the tape deck he had acquired from his backpack, and lost himself in music for a while. It was still a long while later until Asuka awoke.

觉得做早餐还早了些，真嗣便小心翼翼地从背包里取出他新得的磁带播放器，沉浸在音乐中片刻。又过了许久，明日香才醒来。

She was mumbling inaudibly beside him, and Shinji ignored it for the most part. The tossing and turning came next, and Shinji this time directed his attention towards her. He couldn't see her face, but had to assume that it was scrunched up. She seemed to be having a nightmare of sorts. He wasn't sure whether he should wake her up, as she would no doubt be unhappy about there current closeness. It seemed that he didn't have to however, because Asuka suddenly sat bolt upright, her eyes flying open. She didn't say anything, but her hand was oddly outstretched as though it was trying to reach for something.

她在他旁边含糊不清地咕哝着，真嗣大部分时间都忽略了。接下来是翻来覆去，这次真嗣把注意力转向了她。他看不见她的脸，但不得不假设她的脸是皱成一团的。她似乎在做噩梦。他不确定是否应该叫醒她，因为她无疑会对他们现在的亲密感到不快。然而，他似乎不必这么做，因为明日香突然直挺挺地坐了起来，眼睛猛地睁开。她什么也没说，但她的手奇怪地伸出来，好像在试图抓住什么东西。

It took her several more moments until she notice Shinji still laying beside her, and Shinji was surprised that her expression didn't change. Instead, she flopped back down on the ground and turned away from him.

又过了好一会儿，她才注意到真嗣还躺在她旁边，真嗣惊讶于她的表情没有变化。相反，她砰地一声倒在地上，转过身去背对着他。

"You hungry?" asked Shinji calmly.

“你饿了吗？”真嗣平静地问道。

"Not really," came Asuka's voice after a pause.

"不太算吧，" 明日香停顿了一下后说道。

"All right...just let me know when you want breakfast."

"好吧……你想吃早餐时告诉我一声。"

It was perhaps several more minutes before Asuka spoke again.

或许又过了几分钟，明日香才再次开口。

"Have you been up long?"

“你起床很久了吗？”

"An hour, maybe more," Shinji replied.

“大概一小时，或许更久，”真嗣回答道。

"And you didn't think to move away from me?"

"你没想到要离我远点吗？"

"The thought never really crossed my mind. Also, I didn't really want to wake you by accident. You would have gotten angry anyway."

"我确实没怎么想过。而且，我也不想不小心把你吵醒，反正你肯定会生气的。"

Asuka felt herself get angry just then at his words, but also felt a hint of embarrassment.

听到他的话，明日香感到一阵恼火，但同时也有些尴尬。

"How are you holding up?" Shinji said quietly.

“你还好吗？”真嗣轻声问道。

He wasn't sure whether he expected a reply, but he was curious all the same.

他不确定自己是否期待一个回答，但同样感到好奇。

In reply, Asuka turned over on her back and was now looking up at the tent. Her face didn't change, but Shinji thought he caught something in her eyes.

作为回应，明日香翻了个身，仰面朝向帐篷顶。她的表情没有变化，但真嗣觉得他在她的眼中捕捉到了一丝情绪。

"I'm not really sure," she started slowly. "Everything...is rather hard to take in right now. Four months gone? How can anyone expect to come to terms with that? I don't even know if I'm the same person anymore."

"我真的不太确定，"她缓缓开口，"一切……都太难以接受了。四个月就这样过去了？谁能指望我这么快就适应？我甚至不知道自己是否还是同一个人。"

Shinji understood her, as he had been thinking similar things.

真嗣理解她的感受，因为他也在思考类似的问题。

"It was certainly a shock, finding those papers, and the ones that mentioned Nerv. There are just too many things that I don't know...we, I should say."

"发现那些文件，还有提到 Nerv 的那些，确实是个震惊。有太多我不知道的事情……应该说，是我们不知道的事情。"

"We?" "我们？"

"Isn't it strange Shinji," said Asuka, "that we are both here together, and that both of us have memory loss? Both of us which had connections with Nerv, and the same organization existed to prevent Third Impact. Well, we're both here, so something must have fucked up."

"真嗣，你不觉得奇怪吗？" 明日香说道，"我们俩都一起在这里，而且都失去了记忆。我们俩都与 NERV 有关联，那个组织本是为了防止第三次冲击而存在的。既然我们都来到了这里，那一定是出了什么问题。"

"So, those four months, did we fight the angels together?"

"那么，那四个月里，我们是一起对抗天使的吗？"

"I can only surmise. Why don't we remember any of it though? Unless, when Third Impact happened we lost our memories."

"我只能推测。但为什么我们一点记忆都没有呢？除非，在第三次冲击发生时我们失去了记忆。"

"Why was it only those four specific months then, and why are we the only ones here then? Shouldn't everyone have died?

"为什么偏偏是那四个月，为什么只有我们在这里？其他人难道不应该都死了吗？"

"I don't know," said Asuka as she shook her head rather vigorously. "I'd rather not think about such things if I can it help."

“我不知道，”明日香摇着头，相当用力地说，“如果可以的话，我宁愿不去想这些事。”

"What was that dream about then?" asked Shinji almost inaudibly.

“那梦是关于什么的？” 真嗣几乎听不见地问道。

"Dream?" asked Asuka puzzled.

"梦？" 明日香困惑地问。

"You looked like you were having a nightmare, and you sat upright suddenly, looking as though you were reaching for something.

"你看起来像是在做噩梦，突然坐直了身子，好像在伸手去抓什么东西。

"First off, it wasn't a nightmare. I was just remembering somebody from before. She was something like a guardian to me I guess. I was gonna be living at her place while staying in Tokyo-3. I don't know why I dreamt of her...I had hardly thought of her until now."

"首先，那不是噩梦。我只是想起了以前的一个熟人。她对我来说有点像守护者吧。我打算在第三新东京市期间住在她那里。我不知道为什么梦到她...直到现在我几乎没怎么想起过她。"

"Did she work at Nerv?"

"她在 NERV 工作吗？"

"Yeah. She was an unusual person though. A total slob who was always drinking and somebody who couldn't drive for shit. But, she had helped me out several times when I was transferring from Germany to Japan."

"是的。但她是个很特别的人。一个邋遢鬼，总是喝酒，开车技术烂透了。不过，当我从德国转到日本时，她帮了我好几次。"

"What was her name?" asked Shinji.

"她叫什么名字？" 真嗣问道。"

"Misato." "美里。"

Images hit Shinji then, flashing by him. His head seared with pain, and it took everything within him to not grasp his head. It was unusual pain the likes which he had never felt before. Emotions filled him, emotions that he couldn't understand. What was this feeling? The name? It had to be the name! But he had never heard it before in his life. It was impossible! But no...something...what Asuka had said. Her guardian? His guardian? Their guardian? How was that supposed to make sense? He had never heard the name, but something else...the images. Suddenly, his mind went back to what he had seen at the Geofront. The immense amount of blood against the vent, an unusual amount of red. The voices as well. Was that what it was? But why should he think this?

图像此时冲击着真嗣，在他眼前闪过。他的头剧痛无比，几乎用尽全力才没有抱住头。这种痛苦异常，是他从未体验过的。情感涌入他的心中，那些他无法理解的情感。这是什么感觉？那个名字？一定是那个名字！但他一生中从未听过。这不可能！但不是...某种...阿斯卡说过的话。她的监护人？他的监护人？他们的监护人？这怎么可能说得通？他从未听过这个名字，但还有别的...那些图像。突然，他的思绪回到了他在地底前线看到的景象。通风口上大量的血迹，异常的红色。还有那些声音。这就是原因吗？但他为什么会这么想？

Unfortunately for him, Asuka couldn't help but notice the sudden change in Shinji's expression.

不幸的是，对于他来说，明日香无法不注意到真嗣表情上的突然变化。

"Misato's name...why did you react to it?"

"美里这个名字...你为何会有反应？"

Her voice was low. 她的声音很低。

"What do you mean?" replied Shinji, trying to ignore his splitting headache.

"你是什么意思？" 真嗣回答道，试图忽略那剧烈的头痛。

"Don't lie to me Shinji," said Asuka, her face suddenly serious. "You've heard Misato's name before!"

"别对我撒谎，真嗣，" 明日香突然严肃地说，"你之前肯定听过美里这个名字！"

"I haven't damn it!" said Shinji firing back at her, his voice loud.

"我真没听过，该死！" 真嗣回敬道，声音很大。"

"What was that then?" asked Asuka.

"那刚才那是什么？" 明日香问道。"

"I don't know," replied Shinji.

"我不知道，" 真嗣回答道。

He didn't know why these things were happening to him.

他不知道为什么这些事情会发生在他身上。

"Shinji...if you know anything at all-"

"真嗣...如果你知道任何事情——"

"I don't." "我不愿意。"

"Even if you aren't positive, I want to hear it."

"即使你不确定，我也想听你说。"

During this confrontation, neither of them had realized how close they had gotten to each other. Asuka was halfway out of her sleeping bag and leaning towards Shinji, while Shinji was closer to her as well. Their eyes were locked with each other. Shinji didn't realize it until then, but Asuka was wearing a tank-top, her minor cleavage just barely visible.

在这场对峙中，他们都没有意识到彼此已经靠得如此之近。明日香已经从睡袋里探出了一半身子，向真嗣倾斜，而真嗣也离她更近了。他们的目光紧紧相锁。真嗣直到那时才注意到，明日香穿着一件背心，她那微小的乳沟隐约可见。

"Fine then," said Shinji as he crossed his legs and looked away from her.

“那好吧，”真嗣说着，交叉双腿，将目光从她身上移开。

He told her about hearing the name, his reaction to it. How, even though he had never heard the name before, he had felt certain emotions pertaining to it. How Asuka's words had jogged something in his memory. His thought that, Misato might have been his next roommate, Asuka as well, considering what she had said. Even though they didn't have any memories of it, he thought that himself, Misato, and Asuka may have lived under one roof. He still purposefully left out the images he had seen at the Geofront. Insanity could only go so far.

他向她讲述了听到那个名字时的反应，尽管他以前从未听过这个名字，却感受到了与之相关的某些情绪。他提到明日香的话触动了他记忆中的某些东西。他推测，考虑到明日香所说的话，美里可能曾是他的下一个室友，明日香也是。尽管他们没有任何相关的记忆，他仍认为他自己、美里和明日香可能曾同住一个屋檐下。他故意没有提及在 Geofront 看到的那些影像，毕竟疯狂也有个限度。

Asuka listened to all this, keeping her eyes fixed on Shinji as he talked. She didn't let her eyes waver. What he said sounded insane, but a part of her felt that it wasn't anything but the truth.

明日香听着这一切，目光始终锁定在说话的真嗣身上。她的眼神未曾动摇。他所说的话听起来疯狂，但她的内心某处却感到，那不过是赤裸裸的真相。

When Shinji finished talking, he let out a low sigh, and fell back onto his sleeping bag. Asuka had her head in her hands and seemed to be thinking deeply about something. Eventually, she said-

当真嗣说完话后，他发出了一声低沉的叹息，然后倒回了自己的睡袋里。明日香双手抱头，似乎在深思着什么。最终，她说——

"How the hell did we manage living together?" wondered Asuka. "I imagine we were arguing everyday."

“我们到底是怎么一起生活下来的？”明日香疑惑道，“我猜我们每天都在吵架吧。”

"Aren't we doing that now?" replied Shinji.

“我们现在不也是这样吗？”真嗣回答道。

Asuka laughed lightly at that, but continued.

明日香对此轻声笑了笑，但继续说道。

"So you became an Evangelion pilot and we lived together with Misato. I can visualize that much, but afterwards..."

“所以你成为了 EVA 驾驶员，我们和美里住在一起。我能想象到这些，但之后……”

She didn't say it, but Shinji had an idea what she meant. That would have only been the first few days within the four months they couldn't remember. Everything else was gone.

她没有明说，但真嗣明白她的意思。那只是他们失去记忆的四个月中的最初几天。其余的一切都消失了。

"What I don't get is, why was your reaction so strong to Misato's name, that you were able to remember something," said Asuka.

"我不明白的是，为什么听到美里这个名字，你的反应会那么强烈，以至于能想起些什么，" 明日香说道。

"No clue." "不知道。"

"Maybe you were in love with her?" Asuka jokingly said.

“也许你爱过她？”明日香打趣道。

"This isn't something we should be laughing about," replied Shinji. He didn't appreciate the humor in this.

"这不是我们应该笑的事情，" 真嗣回答道。他并不觉得这有什么好笑的。

"Lighten up idiot. It was a joke."

"放轻松，白痴。那只是个笑话。"

"Yeah, well, it wasn't funny." Shinji was still having difficulty getting the image of what he had seen at the Geofront out of his head.

"是啊，但它并不好笑。" 真嗣仍然难以从脑海中抹去在 Geofront 看到的那个画面。

"Sorry, but joking is about all I can do right now."

"抱歉，但眼下我只能开开玩笑了。"

Shinji looked over at Asuka and saw that her face was rather sad.

真嗣看向明日香，发现她的表情相当悲伤。

"The reality, is that the person we are now, and the person we were, are not the same. It feels like I've got an empty hole within me, like something is missing. I hate this feeling."

"现实是，现在的我们和过去的我们已不再相同。我感觉内心有个空洞，像是少了些什么。我讨厌这种感觉。"

Asuka smiled bitterly back at Shinji. They had figured out a portion of the truth, but the rest of it was hidden from them. That was about all they could hope for.

明日香苦笑着回应真嗣。他们已经揭开了一部分真相，但其余的部分仍对他们隐藏着。这已经是他们所能期待的全部了。

"Try not to dwell too much on those memories either," said Asuka as she stood up.

“也不要过多沉溺于那些记忆，”明日香站起身来说道。

"How come?" asked Shinji.

“为什么？”真嗣问道。

"There's most likely a reason we forgot them."

"很可能我们忘记了他们是有原因的。"

Asuka didn't know how much weight her words carried.

明日香并不知道她的话有多么沉重。

After their talk within the tent, Shinji cooked breakfast. They didn't talk about the subject anymore, and Asuka seemed to already be blocking out the fact that they had once been living together. Shinji thought the notion funny, that him and Asuka were forced to live together, exactly as how it was now.

在帐篷里的谈话结束后，真嗣做了早餐。他们没有再谈论那个话题，明日香似乎已经在刻意回避他们曾经同居的事实。真嗣觉得这个想法很有趣，他和明日香被迫住在一起，就像现在这样。

Asuka instead got a sick sensation every time she thought about it. It really was an unpleasant thought.

每次想到这件事，明日香都会感到一阵恶心。这确实是个令人不快的念头。

After breakfast, Shinji milled around camp for a while, trying to occupy himself with whatever he could find. It was boring when there wasn't anything to do.

早餐后，真嗣在营地周围徘徊了一会儿，试图找些事情来打发时间。没事可做的时候真是无聊。

Asuka came out of the tent then, fully clothed in jeans and a t-shirt. Her hair was tied back in a ponytail again. In her hand she held the gun she had found yesterday at the capital.

这时，明日香从帐篷里走了出来，穿着牛仔裤和 T 恤，头发再次扎成了马尾。她手里拿着昨天在首都找到的那把枪。

"What are you doing?" Shinji immediately asked when he saw what she had in her hand.

“你在做什么？”看到她手里的东西，真嗣立刻问道。

"Making sure it works." “确保它正常工作。”

Asuka starting walked far away from the tent, further towards the center of the park, Shinji hurrying to keep up with her. When she reached the center of the field, she cocked the gun back, loading a shell into the chamber. Flicking off the safety, she held the gun with both hands and pointed it down the center of the field. Turning around first to look at Shinji, she said-

明日香开始远远地离开帐篷，向公园中心走去，真嗣急忙跟上她。当她到达场地中央时，她将枪托向后一拉，将子弹装入弹膛。关闭保险，她双手握枪，指向场地中央。她先转过身来看了看真嗣，说道——

"You may want to cover your ears, as this is going to be a little loud."

“你或许想捂住耳朵，因为这会有点吵。”

Shinji quickly did so, and moments later, Asuka squeezed the trigger. The gun exploded, the bullet shooting out the end of the cylinder, and rocketed down the field. Asuka didn't fire another shot, seemingly pleased with how the gun had performed. Flipping the safety back on, she pointed it down towards the ground and walked back to Shinji.

真嗣迅速照做，片刻后，明日香扣动了扳机。枪声炸响，子弹从枪管射出，疾速飞向远方。明日香没有再开第二枪，似乎对枪的表现颇为满意。她重新打开保险，将枪口朝下，走回真嗣身边。

"Well it works," she said mildly.

“嗯，能用。”她淡淡地说道。

Shinji wasn't sure whether to be impressed or not. At least if they needed protection, they knew they had it.

真嗣不确定自己是否该感到惊讶。至少，如果他们需要保护，他们知道已经有了保障。

They walked back to the tent, and Asuka stored the gun back inside her backpack. Withdrawing to her book, she had intended on reading, but Shinji had something else in mind.

他们走回帐篷，明日香将枪重新放回背包。她本想继续看书，但真嗣却另有打算。

"Mind driving somewhere?"

“介意开车去个地方吗？”

"Not back to the capital I hope."

"希望不是回首都。"

"No, nothing like that. I wanted to pick up a few things at the grocery store, as well as look for more things to carry stuff in. We've acquired a lot more than what we had initially intended."

"不，不是那样。我想去杂货店买些东西，顺便找些能装东西的容器。我们得到的比最初计划的要多得多。"

"Well, you do have a point there," said Asuka as she looked over to her backpack. It wouldn't even close anymore.

"嗯，你说的有道理，" 明日香说着，看向她的背包。它甚至都合不上了。

Asuka agreed with him, and together, they decided to drive to the nearby grocery store. As usual, they took several bottles of water with them. They would have to grab a few more while at the store. At least there was still plenty of that left.

明日香同意了他的意见，两人决定驱车前往附近的杂货店。一如既往，他们带上了几瓶水。在店里还得再拿几瓶。至少水还剩下不少。

Arriving twenty minutes later, they walked into the store. The smell which had initially sickened them had become something which they were already used to. Shinji surprised Asuka by grabbing a shopping cart and started going down the different isles. Usually, he simply packed stuff into his backpack, but even his was having difficulties closing. He particularly was going down the seasoning isle, grabbing things off the shelf so fast that Asuka didn't have time to read the labels. He seemed to know what he was getting though.

二十分钟后抵达，他们走进了商店。起初让他们感到恶心的气味，如今已变得习以为常。真嗣出乎明日香意料地推了一辆购物车，开始穿梭在不同的货架间。通常他只是把东西塞进背包，但这次连背包都难以合上。他特别在调料区快速地从货架上取物，快到明日香来不及看标签。不过他似乎知道自己拿的是什么。

While Shinji continued shopping, Asuka ambled down the isles, looking at all the different things on shelves. She sometimes did this while Shinji shopped. Since he was the one that always cooked, she usually just let him have his way. Lately though, she had been wishing for something fresher, even though she knew that was impossible. The frozen vegetables had long ago unthawed themselves with the lack of electricity.

当真嗣继续购物时，明日香漫步在货架间，看着各式各样的商品。她有时会在真嗣购物时这么做。既然总是他负责烹饪，她通常就任由他去。不过最近，她渴望一些更新鲜的东西，尽管她知道那是不可能的。冷冻蔬菜早已因电力不足而解冻。

Leaving this isle, she started walking down another, one which she usually didn't pay much attention to. She was interested though, and the talk of Misato from before had reminded her of the stuff. She had never tried alcohol before, but wondered what it would be like. She was looking at a rack of wine, reading the different labels, even though she didn't know what they meant.

离开这座小岛，她开始走向另一处，那里通常并不引起她的注意。然而，她对此颇感兴趣，之前 Misato 的谈话让她想起了这些东西。她从未尝试过酒精，但好奇那会是什么感觉。她正盯着一排葡萄酒，阅读着不同的标签，尽管她并不明白它们的含义。

"How come you're over here?" asked Shinji. He had come wandering over to this side of the store while looking for her.

“你怎么跑到这边来了？” 真嗣问道。他在寻找她的过程中不知不觉走到了商店的这一侧。

"Just sorta ended up here."

“就那么不知不觉地走到这儿了。”

Shinji looked from Asuka to the wine and then back again.

真嗣从明日香看向葡萄酒，然后又看回她。

"Did you want to try some?" he asked.

"你想试试吗？" 他问道。

"...Maybe. I'm sorta curious at least."

"...或许吧。至少我有点好奇。"

"I suppose, but no driving."

"我想可以，但不能开车。"

"I'm not stupid," Asuka retorted.

“我才不傻呢。”明日香反驳道。

"Well, grab one then and I'll go find a bottle opener."

“好吧，拿一瓶，我去找个开瓶器。”

Blindly, she grabbed a bottle of white wine. Shinji shrugged his shoulders at her selection, and pushed the shopping cart to another isle. He found a plastic bottle opener that would work well enough, and pushed the shopping cart out into the parking lot where they loaded up their car.

她盲目地抓了一瓶白葡萄酒。真嗣对她选的酒耸了耸肩，推着购物车去了另一个货架。他找到了一个塑料开瓶器，足够好用，然后推着购物车来到停车场，把东西装上了车。

Afterwards, they drove to several apartment buildings nearby and looked for more backpacks to store stuff in. They weren't all that successful however, and drove back to their makeshift campsite.

之后，他们开车去了附近的几栋公寓楼，寻找更多的背包来存放物品。然而，他们并不怎么成功，于是又开车回到了临时营地。

Being still full from breakfast, they wasted away the remainder of the day, Asuka reading, and Shinji listening to music. They had both agreed to wait until dinner to try the wine.

早餐吃得饱饱的，他们便消磨了剩下的时光，明日香在读书，而真嗣则在听音乐。两人都同意等到晚餐时再尝试那瓶酒。

As dinner neared, Shinji used many of the ingredients he had got from the grocery store. Though the majority of it had been seasoning, he got several more cans of food. After dinner was ready, he popped open the bottle of wine. It smelled strange to him, but he wasn't going to be complaining quite yet.

晚餐临近时，真嗣用从杂货店买来的许多食材做了饭。虽然大部分是调味料，但他还买了几罐更多的食物。晚餐准备好后，他打开了那瓶酒。酒的味道对他来说很奇怪，但他还没打算抱怨。

Walking over to the tent, he stuck his head in and called Asuka.

他走近帐篷，探头进去喊了声明日香。

"Dinners ready." “晚饭好了。”

"Alright," said Asuka as she got off from her sleeping bag. She hadn't moved hers since they had slept next to each other last night, so both their sleeping bags were still next to each other. Shinji didn't think it would stay like this though.

“好吧，”明日香说着从睡袋里爬了出来。自从昨晚他们并排睡在一起后，她的睡袋就没挪动过，所以两人的睡袋依然紧挨着。但真嗣觉得这种情况不会持续下去。

He poured them both a glass of wine with plastic cups they had found. Though a toast felt proper, Shinji didn't have a clue what he was supposed to toast to. Asuka it seemed was already ahead of him, as she quickly placed the cup between her lips and took a sip of wine.

他用找到的塑料杯给他们俩各倒了一杯酒。虽然举杯庆祝似乎很合适，但真嗣不知道该为哪件事干杯。看来明日香已经领先一步，她迅速将杯子举到唇边，抿了一口酒。

Almost immediately, she spit it out. Shinji hadn't expected this reaction.

她几乎立刻就吐了出来。真嗣没料到会有这种反应。

"That is disgusting," said Asuka, her face sour.

“太难喝了，”明日香皱着脸说。

Shinji tried some himself. It was certainly bitter and it left a strange tangy sensation in his mouth. He thought he preferred water.

真嗣自己也尝了一些。确实很苦，而且嘴里留下了一种奇怪的酸涩感。他想他还是更喜欢水。

"Maybe its a bad bottle," Shinji suggested.

“也许这瓶酒有问题，”真嗣猜测道。

"I think wine just tastes like shit," replied Asuka. She had already dumped the wine out of her cup and was instead now drinking from a water bottle. Shinji had to admit she had a good idea.

“我觉得葡萄酒就是难喝得要命，”明日香回答。她已经把杯中的酒倒掉了，现在正从水瓶里喝水。真嗣不得不承认，她的主意不错。

Ignoring the wine, they ate the meal otherwise pleasantly.

他们忽略了红酒，愉快地享用了其他食物。

When they had finished, Shinji cleared everything away with additional help by Asuka. Deciding that the fire could die down on its own, they entered the tent. As Shinji went to lay down, Asuka hurriedly moved her sleeping bag away from him. Shinji noticed though, that it wasn't at the very far end of the tent like before. He didn't moved his, being already comfortable were it was.

饭后，真嗣在明日香的协助下收拾了餐具。他们决定让篝火自行熄灭，便进入了帐篷。真嗣准备躺下时，明日香急忙将自己的睡袋挪开。不过，真嗣注意到她并没有像之前那样挪到帐篷的最远端。他已经很舒适地躺下了，所以没有移动自己的睡袋。

Putting his earplugs into his ears, Shinji rolled over onto his back. The fire was throwing shadows up around the tent, creating strange images in front of him.

真嗣将耳塞塞入耳朵，翻身仰躺。篝火在帐篷内投下影子，在他面前形成了奇异的影像。

Those images from before, he now knew that he had seen the death of this Misato person. He didn't feel anything now when he thought of her, and he barely even knew what she looked like from the image he had seen. It was still with that image though, and he didn't know why he had seen it in the first place. It was obvious that this person had been important to him in someway, even if he couldn't comprehend how. But the fact that he had seen her death didn't make any sense. What was he exactly?

那些之前的画面，他现在知道他看到了这个叫美里的人的死亡。他现在想到她时没有任何感觉，甚至几乎不知道她的样子，只记得那个画面。尽管如此，他还是不明白为什么一开始会看到那一幕。显然，这个人对他来说在某种程度上很重要，即便他无法理解是怎样的一种重要。但看到她的死亡这一事实毫无意义。他究竟是什么人？

He had no idea what happened in those four months that he couldn't remember, but he felt that those images had something to do with it.

他完全不知道那四个月里发生了什么，那是他记忆中的空白，但他感觉那些画面与此有关。

"Hey, Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Do you still want to know exactly what date Third Impact started on?"

“你还想知道第三次冲击的确切开始日期吗？”

"No, I don't think I care enough anymore. Even if it was only another week or two after September 2nd, I don't think it makes that much of a difference. Four months...its enough to know that much. Anymore and-"

"不，我觉得我已经不再那么在乎了。即使是在 9 月 2 日之后的又一个星期或两周，我也不认为那会有多大差别。四个月...知道这些就足够了。再多了和——"

"I'm glad we can agree on that," said Asuka, cutting him off.

"我很高兴我们能在这点上达成一致，" 明日香打断了他。

Shinji didn't reply. 真嗣没有回答。

It was still lingering, the thought of what had happened in those four months, but it was less painful now. Even so, sleep was still difficult for Shinji and Asuka that night.

那四个月里发生的事情的念头依然挥之不去，但现在痛苦减轻了些。即便如此，那一晚对真嗣和明日香来说，入睡依旧困难。

First thing that morning, after breakfast, they drove around in search of backpacks again. They looked around within the area of the suburban neighborhood, but still couldn't find any. Shinji wasn't giving up though, and had Asuka drive into the city. There were more apartments here than in the suburban neighborhoods.

那天早上第一件事，早餐后，他们再次开车四处寻找背包。他们在郊区附近转了转，但仍然一无所获。不过真嗣并未放弃，让明日香开车进城。这里比郊区有更多的公寓楼。

They checked several of the large apartments, the ones that towered high into the sky. Mice had invaded some of these, and Asuka more than once swore loudly as she saw one scuttle across her field of vision. Shinji laughed several times, giving Asuka a reason to elbow him in the stomach. He had never imagined she would be afraid of mice. It was certainly a more girlish side to her. Course, if Asuka ever heard him mention this, she would kill him.

他们检查了几座高耸入云的大型公寓楼。有些已经被老鼠侵占，明日香不止一次大声咒骂，因为她看到一只老鼠从她的视线中窜过。真嗣笑了几回，这让明日香有理由用胳膊肘顶他的肚子。他从未想过她会怕老鼠。这无疑是她更女性化的一面。当然，如果明日香听到他提起这个，她会杀了他。

The apartments smelled rancid and moldy, and in some of them, they were forced to hold their shirt over there nose to prevent the smell seeping in. Asuka complained that she was going to smell like a homeless person by the end of this. Shinji was admittedly getting sick of this as well, in more ways than one.

公寓里弥漫着腐臭和霉味，有些房间里，他们不得不将衬衫捂在鼻子上以防气味渗入。明日香抱怨说，到头来她会变得像无家可归的人一样臭。真嗣也确实对此感到厌烦，而且不止一种方式。

As they were walking back to the car though, Shinji spotted a rather nice looking hotel. Pointing it out to Asuka, they decided to venture into it, as there were bound to be backpacks and suitcases there.

正当他们走回车子的路上，真嗣瞥见了一家看起来相当不错的酒店。他向明日香指出后，两人决定进去探探，毕竟那里肯定会有背包和行李箱。

They entered through the front doors, and looked around at the lobby. The carpet was made out of velvet red and the columns were painted gold. Ignoring the front desk, they walked behind it to a place that read employees only. Pushing open the door, several trolley carts entered their field of vision. Most of them were empty, but several had suitcases on them and backpacks.

他们从前门进入，环顾着大厅。地毯是天鹅绒红的，柱子则漆成了金色。他们没有理会前台，而是绕到后面，那里标着“员工专用”。推开门，几辆手推车进入了他们的视线。大多数是空的，但有几辆上面放着行李箱和背包。

"Grab the largest one you can kind find," said Shinji.

“拿你能找到的最大的那个。”真嗣说道。

Asuka did so, opening many of them until she found two that she liked, both large enough to accommodate her ever growing supplies. Shinji choose several himself, though none quite as large as Asuka's. Shinji was curious about the rest of the hotel, but he supposed that they should leave.

明日香照做了，打开了许多个，直到找到两个她喜欢的，都足够大，能容纳她不断增加的物品。真嗣也选了几个，不过没有一个像明日香选的那么大。真嗣对酒店的其他部分很好奇，但他觉得他们应该离开了。

The ground suddenly started to rumble.

地面突然开始震动。

Shinji and Asuka both froze. Was it an earthquake?

真嗣和明日香都僵住了。是地震吗？

The explosion which resounded was unreal. One building away from them, an apartment building was collapsing upon its own weight. The infrastructure had been weakened by Third Impact, but also because of the shoddy workmanship. The concrete foundation and support beams could no longer hold the building up, and instead, it collapsed upon itself. At first, it collapsed straight downwards, but the weight shifted from one side, to the other side, the one facing the hotel building that Shinji and Asuka were presently in. The building started to slant, and all at once, violently crashed against the hotel. A massive dust cloud enveloped the two buildings. The entire road had been covered in debris from both building.

那声爆炸响彻云霄，显得极不真实。在他们所在位置的隔壁一栋楼，一栋公寓楼正因自身重量而倒塌。基础设施因第三次冲击而受损，也因工程质量低劣。混凝土地基和承重梁已无法支撑大楼，反而使其自身坍塌。起初，它直线下坠，但重量从一侧转移到另一侧，即面向真嗣和明日香所在酒店的那一侧。大楼开始倾斜，随即猛烈地撞击酒店。两座建筑被巨大的尘埃云笼罩。整条道路都被两座建筑的残骸覆盖。

The initial explosion had disoriented both Shinji and Asuka. Shinji's ears were ringing, and his equilibrium was shot. Next, the force of the other building colliding against the hotel created such an amount of force that Shinji felt the whole building teeter for an instance. He himself was knocked flat on his back, and from the loud thud that came near him, it sounded as though Asuka had fallen as well. The wind had been knocked out of him, and his vision had blurred slightly. Something wet felt like it was flowing from his head. He didn't have time to worry about this however.

最初的爆炸让真嗣和明日香都感到晕头转向。真嗣的耳朵嗡嗡作响，平衡感也荡然无存。紧接着，另一栋建筑撞击酒店产生的巨大冲击力，让真嗣觉得整座楼都摇晃了一瞬。他自己被掀翻在地，而从附近传来的沉重撞击声判断，明日香似乎也摔倒了。他感到呼吸困难，视线也有些模糊。有什么湿漉漉的东西正从他头上流下。但他无暇顾及这些。

Standing up on wobbly feet, he made his way over to Asuka. He grabbed her arm, and lifted her up, but found that she was responsive. She said words to him, but he found that he couldn't hear her. Both his vision and his hearing were starting to disappear. She seemed to realize this, because she instead grabbed his arm and placed it on her own shoulder, and tried to pull him towards the exit. At this moment, she noticed the blood seeping from his wounded head.

他颤巍巍地站起身，朝明日香走去。他抓住她的手臂，试图扶她起来，却发现她还有反应。她对他说了些什么，但他发现自己听不见。他的视觉和听觉都开始消失。她似乎意识到了这一点，于是抓住他的手臂放在自己的肩上，试图拉着他向出口走去。就在这时，她注意到了他头部伤口渗出的血。

From high above them the hotel teetered again. The collapsed apartment was pushing against it with such force that it was bending the metal of the hotel. Any second now and-

从高处俯瞰，酒店再次摇摇欲坠。倒塌的公寓以如此巨大的力量推挤着它，以至于酒店的金属结构都被压弯了。随时都可能——

The sound of screeching metal was equivalent to one thousand nails on a chalkboard. The hotel teetered one final time, before it collapsed, the apartment building pushing it over. Concrete and metal beams were ripped apart and thrown into the air. The dust cloud now enveloped the entire city block.

刺耳的金属摩擦声如同千根钉子划过黑板。酒店摇摇欲坠，最终轰然倒塌，被旁边的公寓楼推倒。混凝土和金属梁被撕裂，抛向空中。尘埃云此刻已笼罩了整个街区。

Underneath everything though, Asuka tried fighting her way to the exit. The cloud of dust was stinging her eyes, making it almost impossible to see. Her throat was dry and she coughed violently. She was exhausted and ached everywhere. But Shinji's head wound wasn't stopping. He had already passed out by the concussion.

尽管如此，明日香仍试图挣扎着向出口前进。尘埃云刺痛了她的眼睛，几乎让她无法看清前方。她的喉咙干涩，剧烈咳嗽。她疲惫不堪，浑身疼痛。但真嗣的头部伤口并未停止流血，他因脑震荡已经昏迷过去。

In front of her, the ceiling suddenly caved in. Large amounts of ceiling tiles collapsed, along with several other floors worth of sheetrock, metal pipes, and concrete. Though the building had fallen to the side, a large amount of debris had been pushing down on the lower floors, and the ceiling just couldn't withstand the weight anymore.

在她面前，天花板突然坍塌。大量天花板瓷砖连同几层楼的石膏板、金属管道和混凝土一起坠落。虽然建筑已侧倾，但大量废墟压在低层，天花板再也承受不住这重量了。

What remained of the building came crumbling down around Shinji and Asuka, trapping them inside.

建筑物残存的部分在真嗣和明日香周围轰然倒塌，将他们困在了里面。

And a bit of a cliffhanger at the end here. I wasn't sure if I was gonna include this last bit, as I thought of saving it for the next chapter. But I hadn't done a cliffhanger yet so I felt it was warranted. Look forward to the next chapter!

结尾处留下了一点悬念。我不确定是否要包含这最后一部分，原本考虑留到下一篇chapter再揭晓。但既然还没用过悬念手法，我觉得这样做是合理的。期待下一篇chapter吧！

### Chapter 11: Revival

Took me longer than I had initially intended to get this chapter finished. I've been working on something else that isn't Evangelion related, or even fanfiction related for that matter, so thats been taking up most of my writing time. Getting excited for the upcoming winter season though, so expect more chapter in the coming months.

完成这篇 chapter 比我最初计划的耗时更长。我一直在忙于其他非《新世纪福音战士》相关，甚至非同人小说相关的事情，这占用了我大部分的写作时间。不过，我对即将到来的冬季季感到兴奋，所以预计未来几个月会有更多 chapter。

How long had it been? How many minutes...hours had gone by?

已经过去多久了？多少分钟...小时流逝了？

The darkness was the worst that she had ever felt. She didn't even know whether her eyes were opened or closed. She blinked several times because of this. The dust was still choking her, invading her nostrils and stinging her eyes. She groped around in the dark for several seconds, trying to get her bearings. Everything was still disorienting, but the building had come down around them suddenly. She remembered this much at least.

那黑暗是她从未感受过的深重。她甚至不确定自己的眼睛是睁着还是闭着。为此她眨了几次眼。尘埃依旧让她窒息，侵入鼻孔，刺痛双眼。她在黑暗中摸索了几秒钟，试图找到方向。一切依旧令人迷失，但建筑物突然间就坍塌了。至少这一点她还记得。

As her eyes slowly started to adjust to the darkness, Asuka finally stood up. Though everything was dark, she was able to pick out bits and pieces in the darkness. She seemed to be trapped within a small area. The debris from the floors above had fallen around, entrapping her within an enclosed space. She walked the length of it, finding out that it was not relatively large.

随着眼睛慢慢适应黑暗，明日香终于站了起来。虽然一切都是黑暗的，但她能在黑暗中辨认出一些零星的片段。她似乎被困在一个狭小的区域内。上方楼层的废墟坠落四周，将她困在一个封闭的空间里。她沿着边缘走了一圈，发现这个地方并不算大。

She was not hurt, at least this much she was certain of. She was sore, and her body ached, but she wasn't bleeding anywhere, and nothing appeared to be broken.

她没有受伤，至少这一点她很确定。她感到酸痛，身体疼痛，但没有流血，也没有任何地方骨折。

Placing her hands on the ground now, she felt the soft velvet of the carpet in the entranceway. She had been running back to the entrance when the building came down around her. How far had she made it however? She couldn't remember if she had passed the front desk or not. Something else though...what was she forgetting...

她现在双手撑地，感受到入口处地毯那柔软的天鹅绒质感。当大楼在她周围倒塌时，她正跑回入口。但她究竟跑了多远呢？她记不清是否已经过了前台。还有别的事情……她在忘记什么呢……

"Shinji," she suddenly mumbled inaudibly. Her voice was hoarse and dry.

“真嗣，”她突然低声喃喃，声音沙哑而干涩。

Where was he? She had been dragging him to the entrance when the building had collapsed. She couldn't remember anything afterwards though. Darkness had engulfed the two of them, and then she had lost him. But, he couldn't be far from her. He may even be within this same enclosed space.

他在哪儿？大楼倒塌时，她正拖着他往入口走。但之后的事情她一点也记不得了。黑暗吞噬了他们俩，然后她就失去了他。不过，他不可能离她太远。他甚至可能就在这个封闭的空间里。

She started calling his name. Softly at first, her voice growing louder slowly. It hurt to shout, and she wished she knew where her backpack was. Her voice was cracking, and just speaking was difficult. But she had to find Shinji. She owed him that much at least. She hadn't forgotten what he had done for her. And how could she?

她开始呼唤他的名字。起初声音很轻，渐渐地越来越响。大声喊叫让她感到疼痛，她真希望知道自己的背包在哪里。她的声音开始沙哑，连说话都变得困难。但她必须找到真嗣。至少，她欠他这份情。她没有忘记他为她所做的一切。她又怎能忘记呢？

She started moving slowly, crouched low against the ground as she walked within the space that she had been trapped in. Quickly though, it became apparent that Shinji wasn't in this area. She started calling his name again, but to no avail.

她开始缓慢移动，蹲低身子在困住她的空间里行走。但很快，她意识到真嗣不在这个区域。她再次呼唤他的名字，却毫无回应。

Her eyes had almost completely adjusted to the darkness, and now she was able to take in the entirety of her surroundings. All around her, ceiling tiles and twisted metal lay. Behind her, large chunks of concrete and brick lay scattered about. She approached these first and started moving them. But what was even though purpose of this?

她的眼睛几乎完全适应了黑暗，现在她能够看清周围的一切。四周散落着天花板瓷砖和扭曲的金属。在她身后，大块的混凝土和砖块散落一地。她首先接近这些，开始移动它们。但这样做究竟有何意义呢？

Letting herself fall back to the ground, Asuka looked up at the ceiling above her. She could see several large cracks running the length of the concrete that hung above her. She couldn't imagine it would last long if it had more weight above it.

任由自己跌回地面，明日香抬头望向头顶的天花板。她能看到几道巨大的裂缝贯穿悬在上方的混凝土。她难以想象，如果上面再增加重量，它还能支撑多久。

Standing up again, she started shifting rubble. Even if it was meaningless, she wanted to feel like she was doing something. Dying like this, she didn't want that. Shinji as well, she hadn't forgotten about him. She called his name in between breathes, hoping that she would get a response. Her fingers were soon bloody from shifting debris. She continued however, even if her skin was flayed to the bone. Not like this, trapped in this claustrophobic space. After everything she had discovered, everything ending like this was not acceptable.

她再次站起身，开始挪动碎石。即便这可能毫无意义，她仍想感觉自己在做些什么。就这样死去，她不愿如此。还有真嗣，她没有忘记他。她一边喘息一边呼唤他的名字，期待着能得到回应。不久，她的手指因搬动瓦砾而变得血肉模糊。然而她继续着，即便皮肤被磨至骨头。不能就这样，被困在这狭小窒息的空间里。经历了那么多发现，一切就这样结束，她无法接受。

Asuka continued, determined to get out of this desperate situation.

明日香继续努力，决心摆脱这绝望的境地。

His head was spinning wildly, and he felt a sharp pain attacking his lower body.

他的头剧烈地旋转着，感到下身一阵剧痛袭来。

Shinji opened his eyes in the dank environment. Almost immediately, he turned to his right and vomited. His head felt like it had been split open by an axe. Still disoriented, he wiped the vomit off the corner of his mouth with his sleeve and turned over onto his back. Slowly, he started piecing things together.

真嗣在潮湿的环境中睁开了眼睛。几乎立刻，他转向右侧呕吐起来。他的头感觉像是被斧头劈开了一样。尽管仍感到迷茫，他还是用袖子擦去了嘴角的呕吐物，翻身仰躺。慢慢地，他开始将事情拼凑起来。

Him and Asuka and been looking for backpacks in the hotel when the building had collapsed. He still didn't have any idea how it had happened, but that didn't seem important right now.

他和明日香在酒店里寻找背包时，建筑物突然倒塌了。他仍然不知道这是怎么发生的，但眼下这似乎并不重要。

How long had he been out he wondered? He vaguely remembered blacking out and Asuka dragging him into the entranceway, but after that... His head still hurt though, so he was still suffering from the concussion. Something else though, and he hardly realized it until then.

他不知道自己昏迷了多久，只隐约记得失去意识前被明日香拖进了门厅，之后的事情便一片空白。尽管头部依旧疼痛，表明他还在遭受脑震荡的折磨，但还有别的事情困扰着他，直到那时他才几乎意识到。

Looking down at his lower body, he saw that one of his legs was sticking out at an odd angle. It appeared to be broken, the white of the bone sticking out through his skin.

低头看着自己的下半身，他发现其中一条腿以一个奇怪的角度伸出来。看起来是断了，骨头白森森地穿透皮肤露在外面。

Forcing himself to not pass out again, Shinji looked away and started taking large breaths to calm himself down. He had to think about his current situation. He had a broken leg, could hardly move, was still disoriented from his concussion, and Asuka was nowhere to be found. In terms of survival, things were not looking hopeful. Firstly though, he should try to prop himself up.

强迫自己不要再次昏过去，真嗣移开视线，开始深呼吸以平复心情。他必须考虑当前的处境。他有一条断腿，几乎动弹不得，因脑震荡而感到头晕目眩，而明日香却不见踪影。就生存而言，情况并不乐观。不过首先，他应该试着让自己坐起来。

Though his vision was still hazy, he had started to adjust to the darkness. He was in a small space, devoid of light, and surrounded by large slabs of concrete and brick. He was trapped, that much was certain.

尽管视线依旧模糊，但他已经开始适应黑暗。他身处一个狭小的空间，没有光线，四周被巨大的混凝土和砖块包围。他被困住了，这一点毋庸置疑。

Slowly, he forced himself to stand up, putting all his weight onto his good leg, and hobbled over to one of the crumbled walls of concrete. He pressed his back against the wall and slid down it, stretching his broken leg out. It hurt like hell, but complaining about it wouldn't do him any good.

他慢慢地强迫自己站起来，将所有重量都压在完好的那条腿上，一瘸一拐地走向一堆碎裂的混凝土墙。他背靠着墙，滑坐下来，伸直了那条受伤的腿。疼痛难忍，但抱怨也无济于事。

This situation, if he thought about it, was his fault that they had gotten stuck in this mess. Course, he couldn't have predicted the building collapsing on them, but if he hadn't suggested they check out the hotel, none of this would have happened. And Asuka was...he didn't even know whether she was alive or not.

如果他仔细想想，这一切都是他的错，他们才会陷入这种困境。当然，他无法预料到建筑物会倒塌在他们身上，但如果他没有提议去查看那家酒店，这一切都不会发生。而明日香……他甚至不知道她是否还活着。

He called her name though, hoping to hear something, anything. His own voice simply echoed within the space he was trapped in. He didn't have his backpack, or anything to assist him with. Even if Asuka was still alive, he couldn't see how she could help him. She was likely in a similar situation as himself. Hopefully she wasn't injured at least.

他呼唤着她的名字，希望能听到些什么，任何声音都好。然而，他的声音只是在这个困住他的空间里回荡。他没有背包，也没有任何工具可以借助。即使明日香还活着，他也想不出她能如何帮助他。她很可能也处于类似的困境中。至少希望她没有受伤。

Closing his eyes, he tried to ignore the pain that was coursing through his body. This much at least, he may be able to endure this much. The thought that Asuka may be dead, and he was the only one left though.

他闭上眼睛，试图忽视身体里肆虐的疼痛。至少这一点，他或许还能忍受。但想到明日香可能已经死去，而他成了唯一幸存的人，这个念头……

That thought hurt him more than the pain in his leg.

这个念头比他腿上的疼痛更让他痛苦。

Asuka hadn't given up. If anything, she felt herself more determined than ever before. She simply worked with her hands, shifting brick and pieces of concrete. As long as she continued doing this, everything was okay. She didn't think, she simply acted. If what she was doing was helpful in someway, if what she was doing made a difference, she would continue doing it.

明日香并未放弃。如果说有什么不同，她觉得自己比以往任何时候都更加坚定。她只是用双手搬动砖块和混凝土碎片。只要她继续这样做，一切都没问题。她不去思考，只是行动。如果她所做的是有帮助的，如果她所做的能带来改变，她就会继续做下去。

Shinji couldn't be dead. That had been pushed to the far reaches of her mind. Yes it had surfaced, and yes she had thought of it, but it couldn't happen, wouldn't happen. If she just kept working, she would eventually find him.

真嗣不可能死了。这个念头被她推到了脑海的最深处。是的，它曾浮现过，是的，她曾想过，但它不可能发生，也不会发生。只要她继续工作，她最终会找到他的。

Did she owe him? Maybe she did, maybe she didn't. She hadn't thought about that however. They had been together for nearly two months now, and some things just couldn't be summed up in the time spent together. They were in this together, as they had both said to each other.

她欠他吗？也许欠，也许不欠。然而，她并没有去想这个问题。他们已经在一起近两个月了，有些事情是无法用在一起的时间来概括的。他们是一起的，正如他们彼此所说的那样。

Asuka called Shinji again, pausing briefly in her work. She was sweating immensely now, her clothes sticking to her skin. She was covered in so much dust that she almost looked like a ghost. Giving up wasn't an option however. She returned to work, but she was working more slowly now. She was tired, thirsty, and hungry, but something else was gnawing at her. Namely, her air supply. She had no idea how long her supply of air would last. It had already been thirty minutes since she had started she assumed, and with her increased breathing and work, she was burning precious air. She was hopeful that there was a crack somewhere in the debris however, that was letting new air in. Again though, this was mere hope.

明日香再次呼唤着真嗣，工作中的她短暂停顿。此刻她大汗淋漓，衣物紧贴肌肤。浑身沾满灰尘，几乎像个幽灵。但放弃绝非选项。她重新投入工作，只是动作愈发缓慢。疲惫、口渴、饥饿，还有更让她焦虑的——空气供应。她不知还能撑多久，自开始以来已过三十分钟，她推测，随着呼吸加剧和劳作，宝贵的空气正被迅速消耗。她寄希望于废墟某处有裂缝，能引入新鲜空气。然而，这也仅是希望而已。

Through everything though, Asuka continued calling Shinji's name, no matter how breathless it made her feel.

尽管如此，明日香仍不停地呼喊着真嗣的名字，即便这让她感到愈发喘不过气。

At some point, Shinji had dozed off. He found that he was able to shut off the pain, although this may merely have been because he couldn't feel his leg anymore. It was lifeless, and had quickly swelled up like a balloon.

在某一刻，真嗣打起了瞌睡。他发现自己能够屏蔽疼痛，尽管这可能仅仅是因为他已经感觉不到自己的腿了。那条腿毫无生气，迅速肿胀得像气球一样。

He looked around at his surroundings, but nothing had changed. His head wasn't as bad now, so that was something at least. In fact, it hardly hurt at all anymore. Shinji was surprised by this, but didn't think long on it.

他环顾四周，但一切依旧如故。现在他的头没那么难受了，至少算是个好消息。实际上，几乎不再感到疼痛了。这让真嗣有些惊讶，但他并未深思。

What was he supposed to do right now? Waiting for help seemed impossible. But so did moving the rubble. He had to do something though. Asuka would surely berate him for not doing anything in this situation. It wasn't as though he had given up, but on the other hand...

他现在应该做什么呢？等待救援似乎是不可能的。但移动这些废墟也一样。他总得做点什么。明日香肯定会因为他在这情况下什么都不做而责骂他。他并没有放弃，但另一方面……

'I'm being pathetic,' thought Shinji.

'我真是没用，' 真嗣心想。

He was he realized. Even when Asuka had been stuck on the beach, she hadn't given up. She had crawled her way to the ocean just to get water. She hadn't given up, even when everything was against her. Shinji could never fathom what those few days had been like for her, but here he was, already giving up.

他意识到自己就是那样。即便明日香被困在海滩上时，她也没有放弃。她一路爬向海洋只为取水。即使一切都在与她作对，她也没有放弃。真嗣无法想象那几天对她来说是怎样的，但此刻的他，却已经选择了放弃。

Something, anything would do. Even if his leg was broken, even if he was tired and exhausted, giving up now wasn't an option. They had come so far together and had discovered so much about not only their memories, but each other. Shinji wasn't about to throw that away.

任何事情，无论多么微不足道，都行。即使他的腿断了，即使他疲惫不堪，现在放弃绝不是选项。他们一起走过了这么远，不仅找回了记忆，也更加了解了彼此。真嗣不打算就这样放弃。

Shifting around, so that he now faced the concrete wall that he had been leaning against, he started moving the smaller pieces of stone and brick. He was sitting down as he did this, and had to moved forward on his hands before sitting back down. Every time he leaned forward or moved, he felt a dull pain in his leg that made him clench his teeth so hard he thought they would break. He was doing something though and that was at least made him feel better.

他挪动身体，转向他一直倚靠的水泥墙，开始移动那些较小的石块和砖头。他坐着做这些，每次向前移动双手后再坐回来。每当他前倾或移动时，腿上的隐痛让他咬紧牙关，几乎以为牙齿会碎掉。但至少他在做些什么，这让他感觉好一些。

Slowly, he began to move enough rubble and created a small crawl space, not even tall enough from him to stand in. He had to be extremely careful, as each brick he moved could bring a large portion of the area down. He was taking a large gamble, more than he cared to think about. He paused occasionally to catch his breath, but he slowly began to realized something. He could feel something pressing against his face. Air was seeping in from somewhere. The air was different from the staleness he was currently breathing in. It was more fresh. He couldn't tell where it was coming from however.

他缓缓地开始移动碎石，开辟出一个仅够爬行的小空间，甚至不足以让他站立。他必须极其小心，因为每移动一块砖都可能导致大片区域坍塌。他在冒一个巨大的风险，远超过他愿意去想的程度。他偶尔停下来喘口气，但渐渐地，他意识到一些事情。他感觉到有什么东西压在脸上。空气正从某个地方渗入。这空气与他目前呼吸的沉闷空气不同，更新鲜。然而，他无法确定空气来自何处。

Something else about the air, and Shinji couldn't exactly make out what it was, but something felt familiar within it.

关于这空气，还有些别的什么，真嗣无法确切指出是什么，但其中有些东西让他感到熟悉。

He continued digging, slowly making his way towards the familiar smell.

他继续挖掘，慢慢地向那熟悉的气味靠近。

Asuka hardly noticed how much progress she had made.

明日香几乎没有注意到自己已经取得了多少进展。

She had moved a large amount of brick and concrete, enlarging the area she was trapped in. She didn't know whether this was doing any good however. Currently, she was sitting in the middle of the area she had been trapped in, resting. She was exhausted from everything, and her mind was starting to question her course of action. If she let herself think about it, then everything would collapse. If she had made a wrong decision...her mind continued thinking that.

她已经移动了大量的砖块和混凝土，扩大了自己被困的空间。然而，她不知道这样做是否有任何好处。目前，她正坐在被困区域的中央休息。她已经筋疲力尽，思绪开始质疑自己的行动方案。如果她让自己去思考，那么一切都会崩溃。如果她做出了错误的决定...她的思绪继续这样想着。

She had made her decision though, and had to follow through with it.

尽管如此，她已经做出了决定，必须坚持到底。

Standing up once again, she made her way over to where she had been working and crouched down. Just as she was about to start shifting rubble, she called Shinji's name again. How many times had she called for him in the past hour? She didn't know, but it was more of a reflex now, something she did out of habit. She hadn't heard a response yet, and part of her didn't expect one.

她再次站起身，走向之前工作的地方，蹲了下来。就在她准备开始搬动碎石时，她再次呼唤了真嗣的名字。过去的一个小时里，她呼唤了他多少次？她记不清了，但现在这更像是一种习惯性的动作。她还没有听到回应，而她的一部分内心并不期待会有回应。

As usual, she didn't, and started shifting rubble again.

一如既往，她没有得到回应，又开始搬动碎石。

It was then though, that she did hear something.

就在那时，她确实听到了一些声音。

Just as she had been about to move a small chunk of concrete, she heard a muffled sound. She stopped what she was doing and listened. The muffled noise came again. Asuka pressed her ear against the wall in front of her and paused, before calling Shinji's name again.

正当她准备移动一小块混凝土时，她听到了一声闷响。她停下手中的动作，仔细聆听。那闷声再次传来。明日香将耳朵贴在面前的墙上，停顿片刻，再次呼唤了真嗣的名字。

It came several seconds later, a reply. It was impossible to understand with the debris separating them, but Asuka could tell that what she heard was Shinji's voice. She didn't say anything else, but started moving bricks meticulously. He was alive, and that was all that mattered. She felt glad then, glad that she could see him again. She had gotten used to seeing his stupid face so much that this time spent apart felt like several days instead of an hour. It was an odd thought that she had missed Shinji, and though Asuka could never explain it, she may have understood a portion of it deep inside her.

几秒钟后，传来了回应。尽管废墟隔断了他们的交流，难以听清，但明日香能确定那是真嗣的声音。她没有再说什么，而是开始小心翼翼地移动砖块。他还活着，这就足够了。她感到一阵欣慰，欣慰于能再次见到他。她已经习惯了那张愚蠢的脸，以至于这段时间的分离感觉像是过了好几天而不是一个小时。她竟然想念真嗣，这个念头虽然奇怪，但明日香内心深处或许理解了其中的一部分。

She continued working, just as Shinji was doing something similar behind the wall separating them. Eventually, they lessened the distance to the point that they could talk to each other.

她继续工作，就像真嗣在隔开他们的墙后做着类似的事情一样。最终，他们缩短了距离，以至于能够互相交谈。

"Shinji, can you here me?" asked Asuka, shouting through the wall of debris that separated them.

"真嗣，你能听到我说话吗？" 明日香隔着那堵废墟墙大声喊道。

"Yeah," came Shinji's reply. His voice was low and sounded painful. Asuka immediately took this to mean something was wrong.

"嗯，" 真嗣回答道。他的声音低沉且听起来很痛苦。明日香立刻意识到他可能受伤了。

"What happened to you? Are you hurt?"

"你怎么了？受伤了吗？"

"Don't worry about that right now. Just focus on moving the rubble."

"现在别担心那个。集中精力搬开这些碎石。"

Asuka wanted to ask him more questions, but realized that he had a point. Even if Shinji was hurt, talking about it while they still had the debris separating them was rather pointless.

明日香本想再问他更多问题，但意识到他说得有道理。即使真嗣受了伤，在他们之间还隔着那堆残骸的情况下谈论此事，实在是毫无意义。

They continued working, slowly shifting rubble. They didn't talk as they did this, preferring to save their energy.

他们继续工作，慢慢地移动着碎石。在这样做的时候，他们没有交谈，更愿意节省体力。

After several more minute of grueling work, they connected the two tunnels. Asuka shifted one last piece of concrete out of the way and was greeted by Shinji's dusty face crouching low to the ground. Though he smiled back at her, his expression was certainly pained. Asuka helped him to his feet and looked back at him. She noticed that he was standing on only one leg.

经过又几分钟的艰苦工作，他们终于将两条隧道连接了起来。明日香挪开最后一块混凝土，迎面看到了蹲伏在地、满脸尘土的碇真嗣。尽管他向她微笑，但表情明显带着痛苦。明日香扶他起身，回头看着他。她注意到他只用一条腿站立。

"Your leg," she started, "is it-"

“你的腿，”她开口道，“是不是——”

"Broken," finished Shinji as pain flashed across his face. He tried to ignore it.

“断了，”碇真嗣痛苦地回答，试图忽视疼痛。

"Asuka...I have to tell you something first-"

"明日香...我得先告诉你一件事——"

Shinji was cut off, as Asuka did something rather unexpected, and hugged him. Caught off guard, Shinji was unsure how to reply, as this wasn't something in Asuka's nature. She was hugging him tenderly, holding him up upright. Shinji realized this, and relaxed himself, falling into Asuka's arms. He was exhausted and his entire body pained him. But Asuka was at least there for him.

真嗣话还没说完，就被明日香出乎意料的举动打断了，她紧紧地抱住了他。真嗣措手不及，不知该如何回应，因为这并非明日香的常态。她温柔地拥抱着他，支撑着他站立。真嗣意识到这一点，便放松下来，靠在明日香的怀抱中。他疲惫不堪，全身疼痛。但至少明日香在他身边。

"I'm glad you're okay Shinji," Asuka mumbled near his ear.

"真嗣，你没事真是太好了，"明日香在他耳边低语道。

"I'm glad you're okay as well Asuka," Shinji heard himself reply back

"我也为你的平安感到高兴，明日香，" 真嗣听到自己回答道

Asuka had her arms wrapped around his back, and didn't seem to want to let go quite yet. The warmth was certainly comfortable, but they weren't out of this mess yet.

明日香的双臂环绕在他的背后，似乎还不想这么快放开。这份温暖确实令人舒适，但他们尚未摆脱这场困境。

"Asuka, I have to tell you...the air here...is different then where I was."

"明日香，我得告诉你...这里的空气...和我之前所在的地方不一样。"

At Shinji's words, Asuka did break off the hug, but still held Shinji within arms length. Shinji was glad for this, as he wasn't being supported by much except Asuka and his good leg.

听到真嗣的话，明日香确实松开了拥抱，但仍让真嗣保持在手臂可及的范围内。真嗣对此感到欣慰，因为他几乎只靠明日香和他的好腿支撑着。

"What do you mean?" she asked.

"你是什么意思？" 她问道。"

"The air here...is being circulated. When I was moving rubble on my side...I must have moved enough because I noticed the change in the air. It was more fresh. There must be a gap...where air from the outside is coming in."

"这里的空气...正在流通。当我在我那边移动碎石时...我一定移动了足够多的量，因为我注意到了空气的变化。它更新鲜了。一定有个缝隙...外面的空气正从那里进来。"

"Can't that wait though? Your leg is-"

"那个不能等等吗？你的腿——"

"I can deal with the pain for now, but this place could collapse any second. We need to find where the air is coming from."

"我现在能忍受疼痛，但这个地方随时可能坍塌。我们需要找到空气从哪里进来。"

"Okay, okay," said Asuka. "Where is it though?"

“好了，好了，”明日香说道，“不过它在哪儿呢？”

"Give me a few seconds," said Shinji. "I can still notice the difference between this air and the air that I was breathing."

"给我几秒钟，" 真嗣说道，"我还能察觉到这里的空气和我之前呼吸的空气之间的差异。"

They both stopped talking, and Shinji looked around the opening they were in. It was certainly much larger than the one that he had been stuck in, but at the same time seemed more dangerous. The ceiling above them was less stable Shinji saw, noticing the same crack running down the length of the concrete wall that Asuka had seen earlier. He started moving around the area, supported by Asuka. It was becoming more difficult to tell where the air was coming from. There wasn't a gust, or a breeze, or anything.

他们俩都停止了交谈，真嗣环顾着他们所在的这个空间。这里确实比他之前被困的地方大得多，但同时也显得更加危险。他注意到头顶的天花板不那么稳固，注意到了那条沿着混凝土墙壁延伸的裂缝，正是之前明日香看到的那条。他在明日香的支持下开始在这个区域移动，越来越难以分辨空气是从哪里来的。没有风，没有微风，什么都没有。

Shinji passed alongside each of the walls, pressing his face against all of them. Several times he paused, thinking that he had noticed something, but he eventually walked further on. On the last wall he was checking however, he stopped and looked at it for a long time. It was distinct, and yet, hardly there. He could smell fresh air coming from somewhere behind the wall, but it was barely noticeable.

真嗣沿着每一面墙走过，将脸紧贴在每一面上。有好几次他停下脚步，以为自己察觉到了什么，但最终还是继续前行。然而，在检查最后一面墙时，他停了下来，久久凝视着。那感觉既清晰又模糊。他能闻到从墙后某处飘来的新鲜空气，却微弱得几乎察觉不到。

"Right here," said Shinji as he placed his hand against the broken wall. "This is where the air is coming from."

"就在这儿，" 真嗣说着，将手放在了破损的墙壁上。"空气就是从这里进来的。"

"Are you sure?" asked Asuka.

“你确定吗？”明日香问道。

"Positive," said Shinji as he bit down on his limits, trying to ignore his broken leg. Asuka noticed this of course.

“积极点。”真嗣咬紧牙关，试图忽视他那条断腿的疼痛。当然，明日香注意到了这一点。

"Come on, lets start shifting some of this rubble," said Shinji as he started to bend down, still being supported by Asuka. She wasn't about to allow that however.

“来吧，我们开始搬一些这些碎石。”真嗣说着便开始弯腰，仍然在明日香的支持下。但她可不打算允许他这么做。

"No Shinji. Right now, you need to sit down and not put any pressure on that leg."

“不行，真嗣。现在你需要坐下，不要给那条腿施加任何压力。”

"I'm fine." "我没事。"

"Stop being an idiot. You have a broken leg. Of course you're not fine."

"别犯傻了。你腿断了，当然不好。"

"If we work together, then it'll go faster."

"如果我们一起干，就会快些。"

"No, if we work together, then you'll just get in the way."

"不，如果我们一起工作，那你只会碍手碍脚。"

Though what she said was true, Asuka was being rather harsh. Trying to explain what she meant, Asuka continued.

尽管她说的是事实，但明日香的话相当尖锐。试图解释她的意思，明日香继续说道。

"Shinji, just let me do this. You're hurt and should take it easy for a while. Besides, if our position were switched, you would be telling me the same thing."

"真嗣，就让我来做吧。你受伤了，应该休息一段时间。而且，如果我们的位置互换，你也会对我说同样的话。"

Though Shinji wanted to argue back, he supposed that Asuka did have a point. If there positions had been switched like Asuka had said, Shinji figured he would have said the same thing. Possibly even stricter.

虽然真嗣想反驳回去，但他觉得明日香确实说得有道理。如果他们的位置像明日香说的那样互换了，真嗣认为他也会说出同样的话。甚至可能更严厉。

"Alright, you win," said Shinji, trying to smile but turning it into a grimace because of his pain.

“好吧，你赢了，”真嗣说道，试图微笑却因为疼痛变成了苦笑。

Asuka gently lowered him down, allowing him to lean against the wall while she worked. At least this way they could talk to each other.

明日香轻轻地将他放下，让他靠在墙上，而她则继续工作。至少这样他们可以互相交谈。

"I forgot to ask, and although it seems pointless now, you aren't hurt at all are you?" asked Shinji.

"我忘了问，虽然现在看来似乎没有意义，但你一点都没受伤吧？" 真嗣问道。

"No, I was fine when I woke up," said Asuka. "What happened is what I want to know. I'm still slightly in shock from it all, but the building came down around us, even though it didn't seem like it was in bad condition."

"没有，我醒来时一切都好，" 明日香说。"我想知道发生了什么。我仍然对此感到有些震惊，但建筑物在我们周围倒塌了，尽管它看起来并不像是状况糟糕。"

"I guess I should apologize then," mumbled Shinji.

"那我应该道歉吧，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"For what?" asked Asuka as she paused in her work.

"为什么？" 明日香停下手中的工作问道。

"For suggesting that we check out the hotel."

"因为提议我们去酒店看看。"

"It isn't your fault Shinji," sighed Asuka. "So don't go blaming yourself like you usually do."

"这不是你的错，真嗣，" 明日香叹息道，"所以别像平时那样自责了。"

Asuka continued working, with Shinji sitting beside her. They talked occasionally, but mostly kept silent, the only sounds coming from the rubble that Asuka was moving.

明日香继续工作，真嗣坐在她旁边。他们偶尔交谈，但大部分时间保持沉默，唯一的声音来自明日香正在移动的碎石。

Pausing for a time, Asuka wiped her brow with the sleeve of her shirt and sat down, leaning back on her hands. Shinji looked at her then. The shirt she had been wearing before had been white, but it was a dusty grey color and her pants had turned a likewise color. The dust that had settled in her hair looked as though she had aged forty years in the passed hour. Despite all this, Shinji still couldn't say she was unattractive. Well, despite her personality at least.

明日香停了一会儿，用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头，然后坐下，双手撑地向后靠。真嗣看着她。她之前穿的那件衬衫原本是白色的，但现在变成了灰蒙蒙的颜色，裤子也变成了同样的颜色。她头发上的灰尘看起来好像她在过去的一个小时里老了四十年。尽管如此，真嗣还是无法说她不漂亮。好吧，至少除了她的性格之外。

"Whats up?" asked Asuka, apparently noticing that Shinji was looking at her.

"怎么了？" 明日香问道，显然注意到真嗣正看着她。

"Nothing," Shinji hurriedly replied as he shifted his gaze away from her.

“没什么，” 真嗣急忙回答，目光却移开了她。

Asuka raised an eyebrow, but didn't comment on that. Instead, she told Shinji-

明日香挑了挑眉，但没有对此发表评论。相反，她对真嗣说——

"I think I should take a look at your leg."

“我觉得我应该看看你的腿。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"I'm not gonna pretend I know much about broken bones, but I at least want to see how bad the swelling has gotten."

"我不是假装懂很多关于骨折的事，但至少我想看看肿得有多严重。"

"Okay." "好的。"

Walking over to Shinji, Asuka crouched down next to him and ripped apart his jeans, revealing the broken leg underneath. His leg had already turned purple and the bone was certainly sticking out through the skin. Asuka didn't think this was a very good sign, but she didn't have any idea how to tackle it either. They would have to worry about that once they got free.

走到真嗣身边，明日香蹲下来撕开他的牛仔裤，露出了下面的断腿。他的腿已经变成紫色，骨头显然穿透了皮肤。明日香觉得这不是个好兆头，但她也不知道该如何处理。他们得先脱困再考虑这个问题。

"It certainly isn't very pretty."

"确实不怎么好看。"

"Yeah, and it hurts like hell," said Shinji.

"是啊，疼得要命，" 真嗣说道。"

"I wish I could do something but-"

"我真希望能做点什么，但是——"

"Just get us out of here. That would be enough help."

"只要带我们离开这里。那就足够帮忙了。"

Asuka nodded and returned to shifting rubble and debris out of their way, following the flow of the air. What felt like hours passed, even though it was unlikely they had been trapped there for so long, when Asuka noticed light starting to peak through the rock. Shouting for Shinji, he hobbled over on his broken leg and watched as Asuka removed the last of the rubble blocking them.

明日香点点头，继续搬开挡路的碎石和残骸，顺着空气流动的方向前进。感觉像是过了好几个小时，尽管他们被困的时间不太可能这么长，但明日香注意到光线开始透过岩石缝隙透进来。她大声呼唤真嗣，一瘸一拐地走过去，看着明日香移开最后一块阻挡他们的碎石。

Rays of sunlight fell down into the hole they had been trapped in; Shinji didn't think he had ever been so happy to see sunlight. Crawling out of the hole first, Asuka then helped Shinji up to the surface. They weren't even in the hotel building anymore, or what was left of it. The rubble had stretched outwards, covering much of the road in front of the building. Looking behind them, they finally saw what had caused the sudden collapse of the hotel. It was apparent that another building had collided against the one they had been in, pushing it over. They were lucky to be alive.

阳光的射线洒进了他们被困的洞穴；真嗣觉得他从没像现在这样高兴看到阳光。明日香先爬出洞口，然后帮助真嗣爬上地面。他们已经不在酒店建筑里了，或者说，不在它剩下的部分里。碎石向外延伸，覆盖了建筑物前的大部分道路。回头一看，他们终于明白了酒店突然倒塌的原因。显然，另一座建筑撞击了他们所在的建筑，将其推倒。他们能活下来真是幸运。

Lowering himself down to the ground, Shinji winced as he did this, but was too tired and sore to move for a while. He was just glad to be out of the darkness. Asuka stood by his side, looking out across the rubble. It was like they were standing on top of a battlefield.

申吉缓缓蹲下身子，这样做时他不禁皱了皱眉，但疲惫和酸痛让他暂时无法动弹。他只是庆幸自己脱离了黑暗。明日香站在他身边，眺望着废墟。仿佛他们正站在一片战场的顶端。

"Looks like our car is at least okay," sighed Asuka as she pointed to there left.

“看来我们的车至少没事，”明日香叹了口气，指向左边。

Shinji looked in the direction she was pointing and saw that she was right. At least that was something. They didn't have to worry about being stuck in the city overnight. Not to mention moving very far with his leg as it was seemed impossible.

申吉顺着她指的方向看去，发现她说的没错。至少这一点还算幸运。他们不必担心在城里过夜。更不用说以他现在的腿伤，走远路几乎是不可能的。

"C'mon, lets get back to our camp," said Asuka as she bent down and help Shinji to his feet. Shinji was glad for the assistance.

“快点，我们回营地去。”明日香说着弯下腰扶起真嗣。真嗣很庆幸有她的帮助。

Asuka walked Shinji to the car and opened the passenger door for him, helping him into the car, being careful not to bang his leg against anything. After Shinji was secure inside, Asuka walked around to the driver side and got in. Starting it, she was relieved to hear the roar of the engine. Reversing the car, she drove hurriedly back to there campsite, glad that they had gotten out alive.

明日香搀扶着真嗣走向汽车，为他打开副驾驶的门，小心翼翼地扶他上车，生怕他的腿碰到任何东西。确认真嗣安顿好后，明日香绕到驾驶座一侧，坐了进去。启动引擎，听到引擎的轰鸣声，她松了一口气。倒车后，她急忙驾车返回营地，庆幸他们能活着回来。

Though the worst was over, Shinji's leg was a problem, and Asuka quickly realized this when they got back to camp. It was difficult enough just getting him down the hill leading to their camp, and they almost fell over several times, but Asuka didn't know what do now that they were back. She had placed Shinji inside the tent, and he had fallen asleep immediately, though he may have passed out because of the pain as well. Shinji wasn't complaining, but Asuka could clearly see the pain on his face.

尽管最糟糕的时刻已经过去，真嗣的腿伤却成了问题，明日香回到营地后很快意识到了这一点。光是把他从山坡上扶下来就够困难了，他们差点摔倒好几次，但现在回到营地，明日香却不知该如何是好。她把真嗣安置在帐篷里，他立刻就睡着了，尽管也可能是因为疼痛而昏迷。真嗣没有抱怨，但明日香清楚地看到他脸上的痛苦表情。

The most obvious thing would be to attempt to reset the bone, but Asuka was afraid that she may break it even worse. Other than that, a splint would make sense, but Asuka would need a large enough piece of wood to accomplish that. For now though, she settled on brewing tea, not only for Shinji, but for herself. After being trapped in their for so long, she wanted something hot.

最显而易见的办法是尝试复位骨头，但明日香担心可能会把它弄得更糟。除此之外，打上夹板是个合理的选择，但明日香需要足够大的木片来完成这个任务。眼下，她决定先泡茶，不仅为真嗣，也为自己。被困在这里这么久，她渴望喝点热的东西。

After the tea had finished brewing, Asuka poured a cup and drank it slowly, thinking about what she would do next. She didn't intend on leaving Shinji alone, both for her peace of mind, but also knowing that if she left him alone, he would likely do something stupid. He had called her stubborn before, but he wasn't one to talk. He still felt it was his fault for what had happened.

茶泡好后，明日香倒了一杯，缓缓啜饮，思索着接下来的行动。她不打算让真嗣独自一人，既是为了自己的心安，也深知若放任他独处，他很可能会做出什么蠢事。他曾说她固执，但他自己又何尝不是。他依然觉得一切都是他的错。

Deciding that she may as well check on him, Asuka entered the tent, but found that Shinji was already awake. He was sweating immensely, something which she hadn't thought of. Removing the sleeping bag that was covering him, she then grabbed a towel and tore off an edge, using this to wipe the sweat of his brow.

决定还是去看看他，明日香走进帐篷，却发现真嗣已经醒了。他满头大汗，这是她未曾预料到的。她掀开盖在他身上的睡袋，随后抓起一条毛巾，撕下一角，用它擦拭他额头上的汗水。

"Thanks," mumbled Shinji through clenched teeth. He was doing his best not to cry out.

“谢谢，”真嗣咬紧牙关咕哝道。他正竭力忍住不哭出来。

"Shinji...I can't just leave you like this."

"真嗣...我不能就这样丢下你。"

"Then what do you suggest?" he asked miserably.

"那你觉得该怎么办？" 他痛苦地问道。

"I don't think I have a choice but to try and reset the leg."

"我想我没有别的选择，只能尝试重置这条腿。"

"You don't sound very confident when you say try."

"你说‘尝试’的时候听起来并不太有信心。"

"I'd rather try than not. Seeing you like this isn't very enjoyable for me either you know."

"我宁愿尝试，也不愿什么都不做。看到你这样，我也不觉得有什么乐趣，你知道的。"

"Do you know what you're doing?"

"你知道自己在做什么吗？"

"Do you really want to hear the reply to that?"

"你真的想听那个回答吗？"

"No, I don't suppose I do," replied Shinji after thinking about it for a few seconds.

"不，我想我不会，" 碇真嗣思考了几秒钟后回答道。

Asuka looked at him for several seconds before she sighed and said, "Okay...I need to get something to brace against your leg first though before I set it. Promise me you won't do anything stupid."

明日香盯着他看了几秒钟，然后叹了口气说："好吧……我需要先找点东西固定住你的腿才能接上。答应我，你不会做任何蠢事。"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"Moving would be the first thing that comes to mind. No matter what, stay laying here. I'll just drive to the nearest house and grab something. Now promise."

搬动是首先会想到的事。无论如何，保持躺在这里。我会开车去最近的房子拿些东西。现在就答应我。

Shinji saw in Asuka's eyes that she was adamant about this.

真嗣从明日香的眼中看出她对此事态度坚决。

"Fine, I won't move an inch," said Shinji. "Not like I could get far anyways."

"好吧，我一步也不动，"真嗣说道，"反正我也走不远。"

"I'll take your word," said Asuka as she stood up and left the tent. She returned moments later with a cup of tea, handing it to Shinji.

"我相信你，"明日香说着站起身离开了帐篷。片刻后她带着一杯茶回来，递给了真嗣。

"Drink this while I'm gone. I imagine you're thirsty as well after being trapped in that building."

"在我离开的时候喝了这个。我想你在那栋楼里被困了那么久，应该也渴了吧。"

"Yeah, thanks," replied Shinji.

"嗯，谢谢，" 真嗣回答道。"

"I'll be back shortly." "我很快就会回来。"

Asuka left the tent, hoping that Shinji really wouldn't do anything stupid.

明日香离开了帐篷，希望真嗣真的不会做出什么蠢事。

Getting in the car, she backed out of the parking lot and drove to the nearest house. Stopping against the curb, she didn't even bother killing the engine as she jumped out of the car. They had already been through this house before, but Asuka was sure that she could find something to use as a splint.

她上了车，倒车出了停车场，驶向最近的房子。停在路边，她甚至没熄火就跳下车。他们之前已经搜过这栋房子了，但明日香确信她能找到些可以当夹板用的东西。

Rummaging through the house, she eventually found several metal pipes in the basement of the house. Grabbing the smallest, she hurried back to the park, glad that she hadn't been gone long; she was however worried that Shinji may have moved.

她在屋里翻找，最终在地下室找到了几根金属管。抓起最细的一根，她急忙赶回公园，庆幸自己没离开太久；然而她担心真嗣可能已经移动了位置。

When she returned and entered the tent, she saw that he was laying there patiently, looking up at the ceiling of the tent. At the sound of her footsteps, he craned his name to look at her.

当她回来并走进帐篷时，她看到他正耐心地躺在那里，抬头望着帐篷的顶篷。听到她的脚步声，他扭过头来望向她。

"That didn't take long," he said.

“没花多少时间。”他说。

"I'm glad it didn't; I want to get this over with quickly."

"我很高兴它没有；我想尽快结束这件事。"

"Agreed," said Shinji as he tried sitting up.

"同意，" 真嗣说着尝试坐起身来。"

Hurrying over to help, Asuka assisted him in moving forward as he slowly propped himself upward. Wincing at the pain, Shinji looked down at his leg.

阿斯卡急忙过去帮忙，协助他向前移动，真嗣慢慢地撑起自己。因疼痛而皱眉，真嗣低头看向自己的腿。

"So, should we do this now or what?" grunted Shinji.

“那么，我们现在就开始还是怎么着？”真嗣咕哝道。

"The sooner the better I think," said Asuka as she examined his leg closer. The skin had completely turned purple around the bone which was sticking out. Asuka bit her lip though, unsure of herself. She shouldn't be doing something like this, but the world wouldn't give her any other options.

"越快越好，我想。"明日香一边说着，一边更仔细地检查他的腿。皮肤在突出的骨头周围已完全变成了紫色。尽管如此，明日香还是咬了咬嘴唇，对自己感到不确定。她不应该做这样的事，但这个世界没有给她其他选择。

"Give me a few more seconds," said Asuka as she left the tent.

"再给我几秒钟。" 明日香说着离开了帐篷。

She returned a few minutes later with a large chunk of firewood.

几分钟后，她带着一大块木柴回来了。

"It'll taste strange, but put this in your mouth. I probably don't need to tell you what this is for."

“味道可能会很怪，但把这个放进嘴里。我大概不需要告诉你这是干什么用的。”

Shinji eyed it, but eventually sighed and said, "No, you don't really need to."

真嗣盯着它看了一会儿，最后叹了口气说：“不，你确实不需要。”

Taking the firewood from Asuka, Shinji placed it in his mouth and clamped his teeth over it. His jaw was barely able to hold it, but at least there was no chance he would bite through it.

从明日香手中接过柴火，真嗣将其放入口中并用牙齿紧紧咬住。他的下巴勉强能支撑住，但至少不用担心会咬穿它。

Meanwhile, Asuka was tearing several strips of cloth from towels, shirt, and any other fabrics she could find. Once she reset his leg, she needed to bind the metal pipe to it somehow. She was glad that Shinji wasn't complaining about the things she was tearing apart; they were only clothes after all.

与此同时，明日香正从毛巾、衬衫以及任何能找到的布料上撕下几条布条。一旦她重新固定好他的腿，她需要设法将金属管绑在上面。她很庆幸真嗣没有抱怨她撕毁的东西；毕竟那只是些衣服而已。

After collecting the required amount of cloth, she lay them alongside the metal pipe and looked over at Shinji.

收集到足够的布料后，她将它们铺在金属管旁边，然后看向真嗣。

"How you doing?" she asked.

"最近怎么样？" 她问道。

"Terrific," he mumbled sarcastically. "I'm ready whenever you are."

"棒极了，" 他讽刺地咕哝着。"我随时都准备好了。"

"Right," nodded Asuka. "好的，" 明日香点头道。

Inching closer to him, she sat next to his leg with her knees tucked under her. Reaching towards his broken leg, she gently placed both her hands on his leg. Shinji shivered at her touch, both because of the pain, and also because her hands were freezing. Though she didn't say anything, Shinji could tell she was nervous. Moving his right hand upward, he rested it on her leg, consoling her.

她缓缓靠近他，膝盖蜷缩在身下，坐在他的腿旁。她伸出手，轻轻地将双手放在他受伤的腿上。真嗣因她的触碰而颤抖，既因为疼痛，也因为她的手冰冷。尽管她没有说话，真嗣能感觉到她的紧张。他抬起右手，轻轻放在她的腿上，安慰她。

"Thanks Asuka, and whatever happens, don't worry about it."

“谢谢你，明日香，无论发生什么，都不要担心。”

"That really doesn't help much."

“那样真的没什么帮助。”

"Just don't blame yourself is all I'm saying."

"只是别自责就好，我这么说。"

"Tell me that after I do this," said Asuka.

"等我做了这件事再说吧，"明日香说道。"

Taking one final breathe, she glanced over at Shinji who nodded slowly.

深吸最后一口气，她瞥向真嗣，后者缓缓点头。

With a crack that sounded like a rifle firing, Asuka applied immense pressure to his leg, pressing down on it with both her palms flat, and then popped the bone back into place. One thing that she hadn't counted on though, was Shinji's reaction. Certainly, he continued biting down on the firewood, but without anything, or anybody to hold him down, Shinji saw bolt upright, his scream echoing through the wood clenched between his teeth. Momentarily thinking that she had done something wrong, Asuka nearly panicked, but quickly gained control of herself and threw herself at Shinji. Grabbing his shoulders, she tried forcing him to the ground, but he was stronger than she gave him credit for. Pinning him to the ground, Shinji continued kicking his legs wildly, the pain excruciating. If she didn't do something, Shinji may very well break the leg again. Looking briefly at him, Asuka couldn't ever remember being this close to him before. Their faces were practically pressed against one another, and the tears of pain that were leaking out of Shinji's eyes were dotting Asuka's face slowly. She was amazed that Shinji could take this much pain and still be moving around this much, but she knew what she had to do at least.

随着一声宛如枪响的脆响，明日香将巨大的压力施加在他的腿上，双掌平贴其上，随后将骨头复位。然而，她未曾预料到的是真嗣的反应。尽管他依旧紧咬着木柴，但在无人压制的情况下，真嗣猛地挺直身体，尖叫声透过紧咬的木头回荡开来。明日香一时以为自己犯了错，几乎慌了神，但很快稳住心神，扑向真嗣。她抓住他的肩膀，试图将他按倒在地，但他比她预想的要强壮。真嗣被按在地上，双腿仍疯狂踢动，疼痛难忍。若不采取措施，真嗣的腿很可能会再次骨折。明日香短暂地看了他一眼，她从未记得与他如此亲近过。两人的脸几乎贴在一起，真嗣眼中渗出的痛苦泪水缓缓滴落在明日香的脸上。 她惊讶于真嗣能承受如此剧痛还能如此活跃，但她至少知道该做什么。

"Sorry about this Shinji," mumbled Asuka before she clenched her right fist, and swung it accurately against his skull, crashing into it.

“抱歉了，真嗣。”明日香咕哝着，随即紧握右拳，精准地朝他头骨挥去，重重击中。

Shinji immediately blacked out, his eyes slowly closing and his wild movement ceasing. Moving off of him, Asuka firstly checked to make sure he was still breathing. Affirming this, she removed the chunk of wood between his teeth. Large indents could clearly been seen where he had bitten down on it. Grabbing the metal pipe and several different colored, torn pieces of clothing, she started wrapping them around his leg. After several meticulous minutes, she was able to fasten the pipe securely against his leg, ensuring that it wouldn't fall off. Leaning back on her hands, she let out a sigh of relief and wiped the sweat off her forehead. The worst was over at least, and now the recovery would start. Even so though, it would be months before he could properly walk again.

真嗣立刻昏了过去，双眼缓缓闭合，狂乱的动作也停止了。明日香从他身上移开，首先确认他仍在呼吸。确认无误后，她取出了他嘴里的那块木片。清晰可见的深齿痕表明了他曾用力咬住它。她拿起金属管和几块不同颜色、破烂的布料，开始缠绕在他的腿上。经过几分钟的细致操作，她成功地将管子牢固地固定在他的腿上，确保它不会脱落。她双手撑地向后靠，松了一口气，擦去额头的汗水。最糟糕的时刻至少已经过去，现在开始进入恢复期。尽管如此，他要想正常行走，恐怕还得等上几个月。

'I suppose I'll have to make a crutch of some sorts,' thought Asuka; she could worry about that later though.

“我想我得做个什么拐杖之类的，”明日香心想；不过那可以稍后再操心。

Looking back over him, she recounted what had happened to them in the hotel. Everything was such a blur during the chaos which had engulfed them, but Asuka felt like she was forgetting something, something important.

回首往事，她细述了他们在酒店遭遇的一切。混乱席卷而来时，一切都变得模糊不清，但明日香觉得她遗忘了什么，某个重要的细节。

Thats right! Shinji had blacked out because of trauma he had received. She had completely forgotten about the blow to his head. Because of his broken leg, and trying to get out of the debris, she had forgotten to ask him about it. He hadn't brought it up either though, which was strange when she thought about it.

没错！真嗣是因为受到的创伤而昏迷的。她完全忘记了他的头部受到的那一击。由于他的断腿和试图逃离废墟，她忘了询问他这件事。但他也没有提起，这让她觉得奇怪。

Moving closer to him again, she examined the back of his head carefully. There was dried blood mixed into his hair, but there wasn't any sign of a wound at all. Six hours had maybe gone by since the initial collapse, so how was it that there wasn't anything there? Moving her hand through his hair again, this time she noticed the faint trace of a large bump. If this was all he had sustained, then where had all that blood come from?

再次靠近他，她仔细检查了他的后脑勺。干涸的血迹混在他的头发里，但没有任何伤口的迹象。距离最初的坍塌可能已经过去了六个小时，为什么那里什么都没有？她再次用手穿过他的头发，这次她注意到了一个微小的肿块。如果这就是他所受的全部伤，那么那些血又是从何而来？

This unnerved Asuka somehow, even though she didn't know why. So many things had happened over the last two days that she was having trouble piecing it all together. Shinji seemed to be alright for the time being though, and she supposed thats all that mattered.

这不知为何让明日香感到不安，尽管她并不明白原因。过去两天发生了太多事情，她难以将一切拼凑起来。不过，真嗣目前似乎还好，她想这就足够了。

Though his eyes didn't open at first, Shinji was still conscious about the world around him. His leg was aflame, but he tried to ignore the pain for now. He was aware that somebody was sitting near him; he could feel a certain presence. Though his mind was still hazy, he still felt his right arm rise upward, his hand reaching out towards the person near him. He felt warmth envelop his hand, as somebody clasped there own hand in his.

虽然眼睛没有立即睁开，真嗣仍然对周围的世界有所感知。他的腿如火烧般疼痛，但他暂时试图忽略这痛楚。他意识到有人坐在他附近；他能感觉到一种存在。尽管思绪依旧模糊，他仍感到自己的右臂向上抬起，手伸向身边的人。他感到温暖包裹着他的手，有人握住了他的手。

"How are you doing Shinji?" asked Asuka.

“你还好吗，真嗣？”明日香问道。

"...Not really sure," Shinji heard himself reply; his eyes were still firmly closed.

"...不太确定," 真嗣听到自己回答；他的眼睛依旧紧紧闭着。

"Why are your eyes still closed?"

"为什么你的眼睛还闭着？"

"I think my body is trying to ignore the pain."

"我觉得我的身体在试图忽视疼痛。"

"It still hurts then?" "那还是很疼吗？"

"Yes, but not nearly as bad as before."

"是的，但没有之前那么严重了。"

"I wonder," mumbled Asuka, more to herself then to Shinji.

"我在想，" 明日香喃喃自语，与其说是对真嗣说，不如说是自言自语。

"How long was I out?"

"我昏迷了多久？"

"Almost twenty-four hours."

"将近二十四小时。"

"That long?" "那么久？"

"Yeah...sorry I had to knock you out."

"是啊...抱歉不得不把你打晕。"

"No, I understand why you did it. You don't have to apologize."

“不，我明白你为什么这么做。你不必道歉。”

After this initial conversation, Shinji's eyes began to open slowly, the first thing they latched onto being Asuka.

在这初次交谈之后，真嗣的眼睛缓缓睁开，映入眼帘的第一人便是明日香。

"How long have you been sitting here?" he asked.

"你在这里坐了多久？" 他问道。

"Long enough," replied Asuka. "I had to keep an eye on you, because you were constantly tossing and turning. You hungry at all?"

"够久了，" 明日香回答道，"我得看着你，因为你一直在翻来覆去。你饿了吗？"

"Starving." "饿坏了。"

Leaving the tent, Asuka returned several minutes later with a bowl of oatmeal.

离开帐篷后，明日香几分钟后带着一碗燕麦回来了。

"Sorry, this is all I made."

“抱歉，我只做了这些。”

"No, its enough," mumbled Shinji.

“不，已经够了。”真嗣咕哝道。

Shinji expected Asuka to help him sit up at this point. His leg still hurt like hell, but he could ignore it long enough to accept the food that Asuka had brought him. Instead however, Asuka knelt down beside Shinji and wordlessly spooned some oatmeal onto the spoon. Seeing this surprising decision by Asuka, Shinji couldn't help but feel he was still asleep.

真嗣本以为此时明日香会帮他坐起身来。他的腿依旧疼得要命，但他能暂时忽略这疼痛，接受明日香带来的食物。然而，明日香却跪在真嗣身旁，默默地用勺子舀了些燕麦粥。看到明日香这出乎意料的举动，真嗣不禁觉得自己还在梦中。

"Asuka?" he asked questioningly.

"明日香？" 他疑惑地问道。

"Its better for you to continue laying down," she replied. "Because of that, well, this is the only thing that makes sense."

"你最好继续躺着，"她回答道。"因为那样，嗯，这是唯一说得通的事。"

She said this last part quietly, her cheeks tinged pink.

她轻声说出最后一部分，脸颊泛起淡淡的红晕。

"Thank you," said Shinji.

"谢谢你，"真嗣说道。

"Expect this to be a one time thing," said Asuka as she patiently fed Shinji.

"别指望这会有第二次," 明日香一边耐心地喂着真嗣一边说道。

After finishing the oatmeal, Asuka left the tent again briefly, busying herself outside. Shinji could here her rummaging around through the luggage outside. Walking back inside, she sat down beside Shinji.

吃完燕麦粥后，明日香再次短暂地离开了帐篷，在外面忙碌着。真嗣能听到她在帐篷外翻找行李的声音。她回到帐篷内，坐在了真嗣旁边。

"What have you been doing since yesterday?"

"昨天之后你都在做什么？"

"Keeping an eye on you mostly...not like I had many other options. I wasn't sure how long you'd be out, and wanted to be sure I was here whenever you woke up."

"主要是在看着你...不像我还有其他选择。我不确定你会昏迷多久，只想确保你醒来时我在这里。"

"How does my leg look?" asked Shinji.

"我的腿看起来怎么样？" 真嗣问道。"

Asuka didn't immediately reply when he asked this.

当真嗣问这个问题时，明日香并没有立即回答。

"How does it feel to you?" she in turn asked.

“你觉得如何？”她反过来问道。

"Still hurts a lot, though not as bad as yesterday. I guess reseting it must have worked."

"虽然还是很疼，但没有昨天那么严重了。我想重置它一定是有效果的。"

Asuka continued staring at him, her eyes unwavering. Feeling that she was looking at him rather strangely, and more so than usual, Shinji asked-

明日香继续盯着他，目光坚定不移。感觉到她的眼神比平时更加奇怪，真嗣问道——

"Is something wrong?" "有什么不对劲吗？"

"...Shinji, do you remember when the hotel was falling around us, and you blacked out because you hit your head on the ground rather hard."

"...真嗣，你还记得酒店在我们周围崩塌时，你因为头重重地撞在地上而昏过去了吗？"

"Vaguely, I suppose. When I awoke in that tunnel, it was my leg which bothered me more. I didn't think much about it."

"大概有点印象吧。我在隧道里醒来时，更困扰我的是我的腿。我当时没怎么多想。"

"Yet I remember, when I was trying to carry you out of the building, your head was sopping wet with blood. You easily had a concussion."

"但我记得，当我试图把你从大楼里背出来时，你的头被血浸透了。你肯定有脑震荡。"

"Like I said, I didn't notice the blood when I woke up, because of my leg and the circumstances."

“就像我说的，我醒来时没注意到血迹，因为我的腿和当时的状况。”

"Did you think to check when we left?"

"你离开时有没有想过检查一下？"

"No, like I said-" "没有，就像我说的——"

"Shinji, the wound is gone."

"真嗣，伤口消失了。"

Asuka said this, her face entirely passive, trying to gauge Shinji's reaction. He was surprised, to say the least. What with his leg, trapped in that narrow space, unsure what had happened to Asuka, that minor injury had seamed meaningless. Yes, maybe he should have checked his head, but getting out of there had been the immediate problem. Then of course when they returned here, they had to deal with his leg. He didn't have any time to worry about his head injury. But saying that it was gone completely, how was that possible?

明日香这么说时，脸上毫无表情，试图揣摩真嗣的反应。他至少是惊讶的。毕竟他的腿卡在那狭窄的空间里，不知道明日香发生了什么，那点小伤显得毫无意义。是的，也许他本该检查一下头部，但当时首要问题是脱困。当然，回到这里后，他们还得处理他的腿伤。他没有时间担心头部的伤。但说它完全消失了，这怎么可能呢？

"By gone, you mean..." “你说‘消失了’，是指……”

"As in it healed completely," replied Asuka. "After I knocked you out, I checked your leg again, and then remembered how badly you were bleeding before. When I examined your head though, all I could find was a minuscule bump with a lot of matted and bloody hair surrounding it. I didn't know what to think of it, and still don't really. Since then, I checked your head every couple hours, but even that bump is now completely gone."

“就是说它完全愈合了。”明日香回答，“我把你打晕后，又检查了你的腿，然后想起了你之前流血有多严重。但当我检查你的头部时，只发现了一个微小的肿块，周围满是凝结的血块和血迹斑斑的头发。我不知道该怎么想，现在也还是不太明白。从那以后，我每隔几个小时就检查一次你的头部，但就连那个肿块现在也完全消失了。”

Almost as a reflex, Shinji moved his hand to the top of his head, and checked for the bump. Certainly, his hair was matted and congealed with blood, but there wasn't any wound that he could feel.

几乎出于本能，真嗣将手移到头顶，检查是否有肿块。确实，他的头发被血粘成一团，但并没有感觉到任何伤口。

"Maybe I didn't hit my head as hard as we initially thought," offered Shinji.

“也许我撞得没我们最初想的那么严重。”真嗣提议道。

"Impossible," stated Asuka. "My hands were covered in your blood, and that doesn't explain the bump that disappeared."

"不可能，" 明日香说道。"我的手上沾满了你的血，而且这无法解释那个消失的肿块。"

"We must have made a mistake."

"我们一定是搞错了。"

"We didn't," said Asuka as she shifted her position towards his leg. Watching as she did this, Shinji could only sit there quietly as he watched Asuka proceed.

"我们没有，" 明日香说着，调整了一下自己的位置靠近他的腿。看着她这样做，真嗣只能静静地坐在那里，注视着明日香继续。"

"Normally, when a leg is reset after it breaks, an object is used to steady the broken bone, keeping it in place, which is why a cast is usually used instead. Using a crude pipe works just as well of course, but thats only if the bone needs to be steadied. Several hours after I reset the bone, I noticed that the swelling had gone down considerably. Though I don't know much about broken bones, I assumed that the swelling would increase for a while after the initial reset, or at least turn several shades of purple. Nothing of the sort happened, and the swelling continued to go down."

"通常情况下，当一条腿在骨折后重新接合时，会使用一个物体来固定断骨，保持其位置，这就是为什么通常会使用石膏。当然，使用一根粗糙的管子也能达到同样的效果，但这仅限于需要固定骨头的情况。在我重新接骨几个小时后，我注意到肿胀已经明显消退。虽然我对骨折了解不多，但我本以为在最初接骨后肿胀会持续一段时间，或者至少会变成几种紫色。但这种情况并没有发生，肿胀持续消退。"

"How is that possible?" "这怎么可能？"

"You tell me. Its your body after all," replied Asuka.

"你告诉我吧。毕竟这是你的身体，" 明日香回答道。"

Shinji couldn't explain this though. How was he supposed to when he didn't even understand what had happened?

但真嗣无法解释这一切。他自己都不明白发生了什么，又该如何解释呢？

"Whatever the reason though," said Asuka, "your leg seems to be healing at a rapid rate, which in itself is good I suppose. I wasn't sure what I was gonna do, since broken bones take months to heal usually."

“不管是什么原因，”明日香说，“你的腿似乎正在快速愈合，这本身是件好事。我原本还不知道该怎么办，因为通常骨折需要几个月才能痊愈。”

"Glad I didn't bother you then," said Shinji rather annoyed.

“幸好我没打扰到你，”真嗣有些恼火地说。

Frowning at him, Asuka said, "I was being serious. I didn't want to think that far ahead, but it looks like I wont have to worry about you. At this rate, you should be able to walk in one to two weeks."

皱着眉头看着他，明日香说道：“我是认真的。我本不想想那么远，但看来我不必为你担心了。照这样下去，你一到两周内应该就能走路了。”

Shinji only gathered one thing from this conversation.

真嗣只从这次对话中得到了一个信息。

"You were worried about me?"

“你担心我吗？”

Not realizing she had said this, Asuka face became several differs shades of red.

没意识到自己说了这话，明日香的脸变得好几种不同的红色。

"Well, considering you had a broken leg, I don't think it was unusual, or should I say it was assumed," Asuka stammered.

“呃，考虑到你腿断了，我觉得这并不奇怪，或者应该说这是理所当然的，”明日香结巴道。

Seeing this reaction, Shinji couldn't help but laugh, making Asuka's embarrassment shift to anger. Shinji was glad that they could laugh about this, but his fast recuperation unnerved him. Those images he had seen of Misato at the Geofront, his unusual endurance, and now being able to recover from a broken leg in only two weeks. All of these things made him question who he was, and he was already doing this because of what they had learned at the capital. Now though, it was an entirely different reason. Was this body even his? It seemed foreign to him now.

看到这一反应，真嗣忍不住笑出声来，让明日香的尴尬转变成了愤怒。真嗣很高兴他们能对此一笑置之，但他快速恢复的事实却让他感到不安。他在地底空洞看到的美里小姐的影像，他异乎寻常的耐力，以及现在仅用两周时间就能从断腿中恢复过来。所有这些都让他质疑自己是谁，而他之所以这么做，是因为他们在首都了解到的情况。然而现在，原因已经完全不同了。这具身体真的是他的吗？如今它似乎变得陌生起来。

For the second time since they had been living like this together, Asuka cooked their meal. The first time she had done it, Shinji had still been fast asleep, though now he was wide awake. Asuka almost wished he was still passed out, because he was constantly asking her what she was doing. Since he still couldn't leave the tent, he had become increasingly impatient and irritable, making Asuka realize this is what she was like sometimes. No matter what she was making, or how she was going about doing it, Shinji wanted to know the step by step process. He only quieted down after Asuka had yelled at him.

自从他们开始这样共同生活以来，这是第二次由明日香来做饭。第一次她做饭时，真嗣还在熟睡，但现在他却清醒得很。明日香几乎希望他仍处于昏迷状态，因为他不停地问她在做什么。由于真嗣仍无法离开帐篷，他的不耐烦和易怒情绪日益加剧，这让明日香意识到自己有时也是这样。无论她在做什么菜，或者如何去做，真嗣都想了解每一步的过程。直到明日香对他大吼，他才安静下来。

Kneeling beside the fire, Asuka stirred the pot slowly. She had made vegetable stew with what ingredients were available to her. Something to warm them up was her initial thought for the meal. It wasn't relatively cold out, but something that could cheer them up at least. Asuka certainly never thought she would be making something like this for Shinji.

跪坐在火堆旁，明日香缓缓搅动着锅中的食物。她用身边现有的食材做了一锅蔬菜炖汤，初衷是想做些能让他们暖和起来的东西。虽然天气并不算太冷，但至少能提振一下心情。明日香从未想过自己会为真嗣做这样的料理。

After sometime, she deemed the stew ready, and ladled some into a bowl. Leaving the campfire, she entered the tent and handed the bowl to Shinji, giving him the first serving. Considering he wasn't able to move, and how miserable he was, Asuka decided it was best to give him first helpings.

过了一会儿，她认为炖菜已经好了，便舀了一些到碗里。离开篝火，她走进帐篷，将碗递给真嗣，让他先吃。考虑到他无法动弹，又如此悲惨，明日香决定最好先照顾他。

"How is it?" asked Asuka as Shinji placed the first spoonful in his mouth. It was more a standard question in a situation like this than anything meaningful. Asuka didn't care whether she was praised or not for her cooking.

"怎么样？" 明日香问道，看着真嗣将第一勺送入口中。这更多是在这种情况下的一种惯例询问，而非真正在意答案。明日香并不在乎自己的厨艺是否得到夸奖。

"Fine," said Shinji rather offhandedly.

"好吧，" 真嗣随口说道。

Accepting this, Asuka left the tent and returned shortly with her own bowl, sitting across from Shinji. They sat in silence for a while, quietly eating, until Shinji finished his first and placed the bowl beside himself. Finishing her own, Asuka stood up and grabbed his bowl, asking whether he'd like seconds. Shinji had declined, and Asuka didn't harp on him. She had a suspicion that Shinji would rather be left alone for now.

接受了这一点，明日香离开了帐篷，很快带着自己的碗回来了，坐在真嗣对面。他们沉默地坐了一会儿，静静地吃着，直到真嗣先吃完，把碗放在自己旁边。明日香也吃完了，站起来拿起他的碗，问他是否想要再来一碗。真嗣婉拒了，明日香也没有多说什么。她有种感觉，真嗣现在更希望独自待一会儿。

Asuka stayed outside the tent after this, washing the pot, bowls, and silverware they had used and then sat around the fire. Though evening was starting to wane, and the first signs of the darkness was starting to surround her, she still didn't have any intention of reentering the tent.

这件事之后，明日香留在了帐篷外，清洗着他们用过的锅、碗和餐具，然后坐在篝火旁。尽管夜幕开始降临，第一缕黑暗开始包围她，她仍然没有重新进入帐篷的打算。

There positions had oddly switched, where now Shinji was the one unable to move, and Asuka was the one taking care of him. If things had been like this initially, Asuka didn't think she would have bothered with it. Now though, over a month had passed since they had first talked on the beaches of Tokyo-3, and they were in this together.

他们的角色奇怪地互换了，现在真嗣成了无法动弹的那个人，而明日香则负责照顾他。如果一开始就是这样，明日香觉得她可能根本不会理会。但现在，距离他们在第三新东京市的沙滩上第一次交谈已经过去了一个多月，他们已经共同经历了这一切。

Asuka understood Shinji's displeasure at being temporarily handicapped, so she could at least sympathize with him, and understand his wanting to be left alone. Something similar had happened to her of course. Shinji had tried to engage her many times, though she had mostly shrugged him off each time. Even if this was only a temporary thing though, Shinji was going to still have to rely on her for several more days until his leg would heal.

明日香理解真嗣因暂时行动不便而感到的不快，因此至少能对他表示同情，并理解他想要独处的愿望。当然，类似的事情也曾发生在她身上。真嗣多次试图与她交流，但她大多时候都置之不理。尽管这只是暂时的，真嗣仍需依赖她几天，直到他的腿伤痊愈。

Sighing quietly, Asuka looked up to the sky when she heard Shinji calling her from the tent. Surprised that he would call her, it took several minutes until Asuka got up to see what he wanted.

明日香轻叹一声，抬头望向天空，听到真嗣从帐篷里呼唤她。惊讶于他会主动叫她，明日香花了好几分钟才起身去看他需要什么。

Poking her head through the front of the tent, she saw Shinji sitting up with his arms folded in front of him. His expression was hesitant, attempting to decide upon something.

明日香探头进入帐篷，看到真嗣坐在那里，双臂交叉在胸前。他的表情犹豫不决，似乎在考虑什么事情。

"Whats wrong?" asked Asuka.

“怎么了？”明日香问道。

"I think I want to try something," replied Shinji, as he looked back at her.

“我想尝试点什么，”真嗣回答，同时回头看着她。

Asuka didn't like the sound of that, or his expression, but she still asked what he wanted to try.

明日香不喜欢这种说法，也不喜欢他的表情，但她还是问了他想尝试什么。

"I need you to get me a knife, just a cutting knife that we have for chopping food would do."

"我需要你帮我拿一把刀，就我们切菜用的那种砍刀就行。"

"And what do you plan on doing with that?" asked Asuka as she crossed her arms.

"你打算用那刀做什么？" 明日香交叉双臂问道。"

"Can't you just get it for me instead of asking questions?"

"你不能直接帮我拿过来，而非要问这么多问题吗？"

"If you were in my position, and I had just asked for a knife while having a broken leg, what would you reply with?"

"如果你处在我的位置，而我刚刚要求一把刀，同时又有一条断腿，你会怎么回答？"

"I'd refuse in all likely hood."

"我多半会拒绝。"

"Then I refuse, unless you tell me what you're doing."

"那我拒绝，除非你告诉我你要做什么。"

Asuka didn't seem to be budging, but Shinji didn't want to tell her either what he had thought of.

明日香似乎没有让步的意思，但真嗣也不想告诉她他的想法。

"I'll say this much then," started Shinji. "It has to do with my leg, and the reason why its healing so fast."

"那我就这么说吧，"真嗣开口道，"这和我腿的恢复速度有关，以及它为何能如此迅速愈合的原因。"

"You think you know the reason?"

"你认为你知道原因？"

"Not a clue, but I'm still curious about something."

毫无头绪，但我还是对某件事感到好奇。

"And having a knife will help you somehow?"

"带着一把刀能帮你什么忙吗？"

"Yes, and if you're so worried, you can stay her and watch incase you think I'll do something stupid."

"是的，如果你这么担心，你可以留在这里看着，以防你认为我会做出什么蠢事。"

Though Asuka looked like she wanted to say something in regards to being worried about him, she bit her tongue instead.

虽然明日香看起来想就担心他这件事说些什么，但她还是忍住了。

"Alright, fine. I'll get you a knife. But any hint of..."

“好吧，行。我给你拿把刀。但凡有任何……”

Asuka didn't finished her train of thought. She didn't think Shinji could be that stupid, but neither did she want to speak about it.

明日香没有说完她的想法。她不认为真嗣会那么愚蠢，但她也不想提及此事。

Leaving the tent, she returned moments later with a small kitchen knife. It had been part of a set they had found at a nearby house. The set seemed to be newly bought by the previous owner, because the blades were still razor sharp. Handing the knife over to Shinji, Asuka sat back, though within reaching distance as she watched him.

离开帐篷，她片刻后又带着一把小厨刀回来了。这把刀是他们在一所附近的房子里找到的一套厨具中的一部分。这套厨具似乎是前屋主新买的，因为刀刃依然锋利无比。将刀递给真嗣，明日香坐回原位，尽管保持在伸手可及的范围内，她注视着他。

Holding the knife in his hand, Shinji looked down at his own arms. While he had been sitting in the tent, he had remembered the white scars that covered his arms that he had discovered in the Geofront. With scars of that size, it was impossible for his arm to still be attached to his body. By all means, he should be missing an arm. He wasn't though, and the scars were significant, because he had likely acquired them during the nearly four months that he couldn't remember. So then how was it that he hadn't died of blood loss?

真嗣手持刀子，低头看着自己的手臂。坐在帐篷里时，他想起了在 Geofront 发现的那些覆盖手臂的白色疤痕。以那样的疤痕大小，他的手臂按理说不可能还连在身上。照理，他应该失去了一只手臂。然而，他没有，这些疤痕却意义重大，因为他很可能是在那近四个月记忆丧失期间获得的。那么，他是如何没有因失血而死的呢？

The answer, he suspected, lay in his body itself.

他猜测，答案或许就藏在他的身体本身之中。

Gripping the knife tighter, he held up his other hand and drew the blade cleanly down the palm of his hand. He had done this so quickly, that Asuka didn't have time to react until a deep laceration had already formed on his palm.

他更紧地握住刀，举起另一只手，干净利落地在手掌上划了一刀。动作如此迅速，以至于明日香还没来得及反应，他的手掌上就已经形成了一道深深的割伤。

"What the fuck are you doing you idiot!" shouted Asuka.

“你他妈在干什么，白痴！”明日香大喊道。

Though his palm stung and was coated in blood, Shinji didn't reply to Asuka. Since he had woken up on the beach of Tokyo-3, he had trekked all around the city, searching for anything that was useful or just walking to remember key areas of the city. During these travels, he had never incurred any injuries. Or maybe he had never gotten any, because they had just healed so fast, and he had never been aware. Cut and scrapes were a normal everyday occurrence, but his skin didn't show any sign of scabs. The only thing that was different, were the white scars that covered his arms, something which he should have remembered acquiring.

尽管手掌刺痛且沾满了血，真嗣并没有回应明日香。自从在第三新东京市的沙滩上醒来后，他走遍了整个城市，寻找任何有用的东西，或是漫步以回忆城市的关键区域。在这些旅途中，他从未受过伤。或许他从未受伤，因为伤口愈合得太快，他从未意识到。割伤和擦伤是日常常见的事，但他的皮肤上没有任何结痂的迹象。唯一不同的是，他手臂上覆盖着白色疤痕，这些他本应记得是如何留下的。

"Shinji, what are you-" "真嗣，你这是在——"

Again, he didn't reply, as Asuka continued yelling at him. He was too busy focused on his palm which was still dripping blood. Granted, if he was wrong about this, he wouldn't be able to grasp anything for a couple of days, and Asuka would surely give him hell for doing something so foolish.

又一次，他没有回应，因为明日香继续对他大吼大叫。他正全神贯注于那只仍在滴血的掌心。当然，如果他错了，那么他将有几天无法握住任何东西，而明日香肯定会因为他如此愚蠢的行为而让他吃尽苦头。

Shinji thought his eyes were fooling him however. He blinked several times, thinking that he was tired, but he didn't think it was a mistake. The blood that was trickling out from the cut had subsided. In fact, the blood which had leaked out was flowing backwards into the wound. Asuka seemed to have noticed this too, because she immediately became quiet.

真嗣以为自己的眼睛在欺骗他。他眨了几次眼，以为自己累了，但他不认为这是个错觉。从伤口中流出的血液已经减少。事实上，已经流出的血液正逆流回伤口。明日香似乎也注意到了这一点，因为她立刻安静了下来。

The blood slowly began to flow back into Shinji's wound, as though being rewound by something. Time seemed to be flowing in reverse, and the skin around Shinji's palm began to repair itself, first scabbing over, and then becoming pink as the destroyed tissue repaired itself. Almost as though it had never happened, Shinji palm looked as though he had never cut it seconds before.

血液缓缓地流回真嗣的伤口，仿佛被某种力量倒带。时间似乎在倒流，真嗣手掌周围的皮肤开始自我修复，先是结痂，然后变得粉红，受损的组织自我修复。仿佛从未发生过一样，真嗣的掌心看起来就像几秒钟前从未被割伤过一样。

Clenching and unclenching his fist several times, there was no difference in the way his hand felt.

他紧握又松开拳头几次，手的感觉没有任何变化。

"What just happened?" asked Asuka, completely amazed.

“刚刚发生了什么？”明日香完全惊呆了。

Holding out his arm, Shinji pointed to the scars that covered his arm.

伸出手臂，真嗣指着遍布手臂的伤疤。

"After you told me about my leg repairing itself unusually quick, I remembered the scars that covered my arm. Under normal circumstances, whatever cut me should have completely sliced off my arm, but all I got were these scars. That made me wonder if any wounds I get don't just automatically heal. I couldn't remember ever seeing a cut or scab since I woke up in Tokyo-3, so I decided to cut myself, and see what would happen."

"自从你告诉我我的腿异常迅速地自我修复后，我想起了遍布手臂的那些伤疤。在正常情况下，无论是什么划伤了我，本应将我的手臂完全切断，但我只留下了这些疤痕。这让我怀疑，我身上的任何伤口是否不仅仅是自动愈合。自从在东京-3 醒来后，我从未见过任何割伤或结痂，所以我决定割伤自己，看看会发生什么。"

"Then that was..." “那么那就是……”

"I don't know how or why, but my cells repair themselves much faster than a normal humans. Thats what it seems at least."

"我不知道这是怎么做到的，也不知道为什么，但我的细胞修复速度比普通人快得多。至少看起来是这样。"

Holding out his palm so Asuka could see, Asuka looked questioningly back at him, before she traced a finger of hers along the line where the cut had been. There wasn't any trick to it; the wound was simply gone, no sign of it remaining.

他伸出手掌让明日香看，明日香疑惑地回望他，然后用手指沿着伤口曾经所在的那条线划过。这并没有什么花招；伤口真的消失了，没有留下任何痕迹。

"How is this possible?" mumbled Asuka.

"这怎么可能？" 明日香喃喃自语道。

"Something happened in those three months that must have changed my body somehow. I know I've gotten injured before as a kid, so this is just as new to me, as it is to you."

"那三个月里发生了些什么，一定以某种方式改变了我的身体。我知道小时候也受过伤，所以这对我来说同样新鲜，对你也是如此。"

"That still doesn't answer the problem," said Asuka.

“那还是没有解决问题，”明日香说道。

Shinji looked back at her, wondering how she felt on this. Even as he was cutting himself, he wasn't one hundred percent sure he knew he was correct, but a part of him seemed to know that something about him had changed. What was Asuka's feelings on this though?

真嗣回头看着她，想知道她对此有何感受。即使他在自我伤害，他也不完全确定自己是否正确，但内心深处似乎明白自己已经发生了某种变化。然而，明日香对此有何感受呢？

"Are you scared?" asked Shinji.

“你害怕吗？”真嗣问道。

Asuka's head whipped up to face him.

明日香猛地抬头面对他。

"Scared? No...surprised and confused yes, but not scared. Why?"

“害怕？不……惊讶和困惑是有的，但不是害怕。为什么这么问？”

"I'm clearly different than you, and I don't even know why."

“我显然和你不同，而我甚至不知道原因。”

"Different in this aspect I suppose," said Asuka slowly, "but that still doesn't change who you are. I mean, you're still you."

"在这方面或许不同吧，" 明日香缓缓说道，"但这并不改变你是谁。我是说，你还是你。"

This easy way of explaining this away, Asuka didn't know how much her words meant to Shinji. At the moment when his wound had healed, he had felt that there relationship would change. He was afraid that Asuka would look at him differently. He was glad that she didn't view him any other way.

这种轻松解释的方式，明日香不知道她的话对真嗣意味着多少。在他伤口愈合的那一刻，他感觉他们的关系会改变。他害怕明日香会用不同的眼光看他。他很高兴她并没有以其他方式看待他。

"Were you afraid that I'd think you're some sort of monster?" Asuka nearly laughed.

"你是不是担心我会觉得你是某种怪物？" 明日香几乎笑出声来。

"Can you blame me? My body is clearly different than your own."

"你能怪我吗？我的身体显然和你的不一样。"

"You're still the same idiot as far as I can tell," smirked Asuka.

"就我所见，你还是那个傻瓜，"明日香微微一笑。"

Shinji himself laughed at that, blowing away the previous tension built up inside of him.

对此，真嗣自己笑了起来，吹散了之前在他内心积聚的紧张感。

"Thanks for that Asuka."  “谢谢你，明日香。”

"What? Calling you an idiot," retorted Asuka, her face briefly red. She knew what Shinji meant, but she brushed if off.

“什么？说你是笨蛋吗，”明日香反驳道，她的脸颊短暂地泛红。她知道真嗣的意思，但她轻描淡写地忽略了。

Standing up, Asuka stretched her legs and took the knife from Shinji, depositing it back in one of their backpacks. Stamping out the fire, she returned to the tent and sat down across from him. Shinji then began to tell Asuka about the other unusual things he had noticed, such as not tiring out no matter what he did. Lastly, he finally decided to tell her about the vision he had had in the Geofront about Misato's death. Though what he said greatly shocked Asuka, there wasn't anyway he could be lying, since he had described Misato exactly.

站起身来，明日香伸了伸腿，从真嗣手中接过刀，放回他们的背包里。她踩灭火堆，回到帐篷，坐在他对面。真嗣接着开始向明日香讲述他注意到的其他不寻常的事情，比如无论做什么都不会感到疲惫。最后，他终于决定告诉她自己在地底都市关于美里死亡的幻象。尽管他的话让明日香大为震惊，但他不可能在撒谎，因为他对美里的描述完全准确。

Finishing with his story, they sat in silence, Asuka thinking on what he had said.

讲完故事后，他们静静地坐着，明日香思考着他所说的话。

"Have you had any more of these...visions, or whatever you call them?"

“你还有过更多这样的……幻象，或者你称之为它们的东西吗？”

"No, thats the only one. Though it might have been triggering a lost memory."

不，就那一个。不过它可能触发了某个遗忘的记忆。

"Maybe. If you were there during her death, then I could see that. But I don't know."

“或许吧。如果你在她临终时在场，那我还能理解。但我真的不知道。”

They were grasping at straws now, trying to make sense of the pieces they had been left with.

他们现在只是在抓救命稻草，试图从这些零碎的信息中理出头绪。

"You should get some rest," Asuka said eventually. "Even if your leg doesn't take long to heal, its still a good idea to rest in the meantime."

"你该休息一下了。"明日香最终说道，"就算你的腿伤很快就能好，这段时间里休息还是明智之举。"

"What will you do?" "你打算怎么办？"

"Stay awake for a couple more hours I guess," shrugged Asuka.

"大概再熬几个小时吧，""明日香耸了耸肩。"

"Okay," said Shinji glancing at her briefly, before he turned on his side. Even if he didn't say anything, Asuka could still tell that his leg was still painful.

"好吧，""真嗣说着，瞥了她一眼，然后侧过身去。尽管他什么也没说，明日香还是能看出他的腿还在疼。"

"God, I feel like his nurse,' thought Asuka.

"天哪，我感觉自己像他的护士，"明日香心想。

Though it was still early, Shinji fell asleep shortly after this conversation, leaving Asuka continuing to think about their predicament, and more importantly, the changes within Shinji. She believed him when he said something likely changed within him during those three months. The question was, how large were those changes, and would they see more in the days to come?

尽管时间尚早，但新治在与明日香交谈后不久便睡着了，留下明日香继续思考他们的困境，更重要的是，新治身上的变化。她相信他所说的，在那三个月里他一定发生了某种变化。问题是，这些变化有多大，以及在未来的日子里他们还会看到更多吗？

### Chapter 12: Warmth  Chapter

Surprise Update! I've no idea why, but after finishing that last chapter, I just really wanted to keep writing, so this one took me about four days to finish I think. Plus, I was reading some other things recently, so that probably got me in the mood to write a chapter like this. But I'll talk more after this.

惊喜更新！我不知道为什么，但在完成上一篇 chapter 后，我真的很想继续写，所以这篇大概花了四天时间完成。另外，最近我也在读其他东西，这可能让我有了写一篇 chapter 的心情。不过，我会在后面多说一些。

---

Shinji slept rather fitfully that night. He awoke many times owing to the pain racking his body, and once or twice had to prevent himself from screaming. During these times he suddenly awoke though, he always turned on his side and saw Asuka sleep near him. She was so close in fact, that if Shinji wanted, he could reach and and caress her hair. Seeing Asuka in such close proximity to him, he was glad that she was near, since the thought comforted him slightly. He supposed that incase anything serious were to happen to him, Asuka would be there in a heartbeat to help him. It was really amazing how far they had come in terms of their relationship.

那天晚上，真嗣睡得并不安稳。由于身体的疼痛，他多次醒来，有一两次差点尖叫出声。在这些突然醒来的时刻，他总是侧过身，看到阿斯卡睡在旁边。她离得如此之近，以至于如果真嗣愿意，他可以伸手抚摸她的头发。看到阿斯卡如此靠近，他很高兴她在身边，因为这个想法让他稍感安慰。他猜想，万一有什么严重的事情发生，阿斯卡会立刻在他身边帮助他。他们的关系能走到这一步，真是令人惊叹。

He awoke several times during the night, but typically fell asleep shortly afterwards. This back and forth happened many times, directly until the sun began to rise, casting dark shadows of the nearby trees across the damp grass in the park.

他夜间醒了几次，但通常很快又睡着了。这种反复多次发生，直到太阳开始升起，将附近树木的暗影投射在公园潮湿的草地上。

Asuka awoke shortly after the sun rose. For the next few days, she would have to get used to waking up this early. Even so, as she unzipped the sleeping bag wrapped around her, she was immediately assaulted by the bitter bite of cold. The temperature had clearly plummeted during the night. Turning her head towards Shinji, she was glad to see that he was still asleep at least. She had been awake during some of the moments when he had awoken because of his leg, but she hadn't said anything to him.

明日香在太阳升起后不久醒来。接下来的几天，她必须习惯这么早起床。尽管如此，当她拉开裹在身上的睡袋时，立刻感受到了寒冷的刺骨。夜间气温显然骤降。她转头看向真嗣，庆幸他至少还在熟睡。他因腿伤醒来时，她有些时候是醒着的，但她没有对他说什么。

Stretching, she slowly crawled her way out of the sleeping bag and poked her head out of the tents flap. It definitely seemed like they were in the month of November, and winter was starting to creep up on them. They hadn't thought about what they would do during the winter, but it didn't seem like they would have long to think about it. The seasonal change wasn't going to wait for them.

她伸了个懒腰，慢慢从睡袋里爬出来，探出帐篷的门帘。显然，他们正处在十一月，冬天开始悄悄逼近。他们还没想过冬天该怎么办，但似乎没有太多时间考虑了。季节的变化不会等他们。

Lighting a fire, Asuka spent several minutes crouched beside it, warming her hands up until she started making breakfast. She had hardly cooked rice before, even though she understood what was required, but she had to admit after she tasted some, that the way Shinji made it was more tender. Ultimately, food was food she supposed.

点燃篝火后，明日香蹲在旁边暖手，直到开始准备早餐。她几乎没煮过米饭，尽管知道需要做什么，但尝过之后不得不承认，真嗣煮的更加软糯。毕竟，食物就是食物，她想。

Even after she finished cooking, she kept stacking more wood onto the fire. She had a feeling that they would need to keep it going all day. The wind that was blowing was ice cold, and Asuka guessed that the temperature had to be around fifty degrees. The sun was beating down on her, but its rays hardly warmed her. She wished that she had gotten some gloves when they had last been in Tokyo-3. Instead, she threw on the red sweatshirt that Shinji had gotten for her when she had still been unable to move.

即使烹饪完毕，她仍不断往火里添柴。她有种预感，他们需要让火持续燃烧一整天。寒风刺骨，明日香猜测气温大约只有五十度。阳光直射在她身上，却几乎无法带来温暖。她后悔上次在第三新东京市时没买些手套。相反，她披上了真嗣在她还无法动弹时为她买的红色运动衫。

She sat hunched beside the fire, unsure of what time it was. Not quite noon yet, but it had to be approaching. She didn't want to wake Shinji up, preferring to let him sleep for as long as necessary. Hopefully, his dreams were more peaceful than the current situation. Even if his body was rather unusual, a broken bone was still painful.

她蜷缩在火堆旁，不确定具体时间。还没到正午，但应该快了。她不想叫醒真嗣，宁愿让他尽可能多睡一会儿。希望他的梦境比当前的处境更平静。即便他的身体异于常人，骨折的疼痛依旧难以忍受。

Sighing rather heavily, Asuka wondered when she had started caring about Shinji so much. It had never been her nature to care about anybody but herself. Being with Shinji constantly though, at some point she must have just gotten used to waking up every day to see him already awake with breakfast almost done. Was this usual for two people who spent every minute of their lives together, or was it because they were stuck together? If it hadn't been just Shinji and herself, but several other people that had been on that beach, would they have grown as close as they were currently? Asuka knew that they shared certain similarities, and that they both had deep roots in Nerv, but would they have realized those things if it hadn't been just the two of them?

叹了口气，明日香不禁思索自己何时开始如此在意真嗣。她本性从未关心过除自己以外的人。然而，与真嗣朝夕相处，不知何时她已习惯每天醒来看到他已经起床，早餐也快准备好了。这是否是两人每分每秒相伴的常态，还是因为他们被困在一起？如果当时海滩上不止他们两人，而是还有其他人，他们是否能像现在这样亲密？明日香知道他们有着某些相似之处，且都与 NERV 有着深厚的渊源，但如果不是只有他们两人，他们是否会发现这些呢？

'Why am I thinking about this so much?' wondered Asuka as she tucked her hands inside her sweatshirt pockets.

‘我为什么要想这么多？’明日香一边想着，一边将手揣进运动衫的口袋里。

During the events of the past two days, Asuka had been constantly worrying about Shinji, whether it had been the collapse of the building, his leg, or his strange ability to recover from wounds. Asuka had never thought about him as much as she had done in the last few days. Though the reasons seemed simple enough when Asuka broke them down into there most basic form, she still had difficulties answering the questions that were plaguing her heart. Caring about somebody beside herself was a feeling she had never felt before.

在过去两天里，明日香一直在担心真嗣，无论是大楼的倒塌、他的腿伤，还是他那奇怪的伤口自愈能力。明日香从未像最近几天这样频繁地想到他。虽然当明日香将这些原因分解到最基本的形式时，它们似乎很简单，但她仍然难以回答那些困扰她内心的问题。关心自己以外的人，是她从未体验过的感觉。

'I don't even know anymore,' thought Asuka as she buried her face in her arms, her brilliantly colored hair spilling across her arms.

'我甚至不知道该怎么办了，'明日香想着，将脸埋在双臂中，她那绚丽的头发散落在手臂上。

Her thoughts were interrupted however, as she heard a slight noise coming from the tent. Looking in that direction, she heard the shifting of the sleeping bag as somebody was moving.

然而，她的思绪被一阵轻微的噪音打断了。她朝帐篷的方向看去，听到了睡袋的沙沙声，似乎有人在移动。

"You out there Asuka?" came Shinji's voice.

"你在吗，明日香？" 真嗣的声音传来。

"Yeah, give me a minute," said Asuka as she tried to shake away her thoughts.

"嗯，等我一下，" 明日香说着，试图甩开自己的思绪。

Gathering Shinji's portion of rice, she brought it into the tent. His face was less pale then it had been yesterday, so it seemed that simply resting seemed to be working. If his body did repair wounds unusually quickly, then it was only a matter of time until he was healed completely.

她端起给真嗣的那份米饭，走进帐篷。他的脸色比昨天好了些，看来只是休息似乎也在起作用。如果他的身体真的能异常迅速地愈合伤口，那么完全康复也只是时间问题。

"Thanks," said Shinji as Asuka passed the bowl of rice to him.

"谢谢，" 真嗣说着，接过了明日香递来的饭碗。

"I don't think its as good as you make it, but-"

“我觉得它没你说的那么好，不过——”

"Rice is still rice," said Shinji as he interrupted her. "Don't worry about it."

"饭还是饭嘛，" 真嗣打断了她的话，"别在意。"

Asuka hid her embarrassment at his words, and looked away from him.

明日香听到他的话，掩饰住自己的尴尬，转过头不去看他。

"Is it really cold, or is it just me?" asked Shinji after he ate several bites.

"是真的很冷，还是只有我觉得？" 真嗣吃了几口后问道。

"No, its not just you. I noticed when I got up as well. Seems like its getting close to winter."

"不，不只是你。我起床时也注意到了。看来冬天快到了。"

"Winter...huh..." mumbled Shinji.

""冬天啊……"" 真嗣喃喃自语道。

Shinji seemed to be thinking about the same thing that Asuka had been thinking about earlier. What exactly were they gonna do if the temperature got too cold, or below freezing? Japan wasn't exactly the warmest place during the winter.

真嗣似乎在思考着和明日香之前想的一样的问题。如果气温变得太冷，甚至降到冰点以下，他们该怎么办呢？日本的冬天可不怎么暖和。

"You cold at all?" asked Asuka.

"你冷吗？" 明日香问道。

"I can deal with it. What about you though?"

"我能应付。不过你呢？"

"I'll manage," replied Asuka. "More importantly though, how does your leg feel?"

"我会挺过去的。" 明日香回答，"更重要的是，你的腿感觉怎么样？"

"See for yourself," said Shinji.

"你自己看，" 真嗣说道。

Though wincing slightly as Shinji shifting his leg, he laid it out flat for Asuka to see. The swelling had almost completely vanished, and the color was starting to come back to Shinji's leg.

尽管因为真嗣移动腿而微微皱眉，他还是将腿平放，让明日香能够看到。肿胀几乎完全消失了，真嗣的腿也开始恢复血色。

"Even if you can regenerate wounds, this is still unbelievable that it could be moving this quickly."

“即便你能再生伤口，这种恢复速度也仍然令人难以置信。”

"It still hurts of course," said Shinji, "but I think I'll be able to walk in a few days."

"当然还是疼的，" 真嗣说道，"不过我想过几天就能走路了。"

"A few days? I estimated one to two weeks, and even that was generous."

"几天？我估计是一到两周，即便那样也算乐观了。"

"I think that the recovery is speeding up though," mumbled Shinji.

""我觉得恢复速度在加快，"" 真嗣咕哝道。

"What makes you say that?" asked Asuka.

""你为什么这么说？"" 明日香问道。

"I don't really know how to put it into words," replied Shinji honestly. "Its like, something that was dormant inside of me is now waking up. Because of my broken leg, whatever happened to me during those three months I can't remember must have started again. Its a very strange feeling."

"我真的不知道该怎么形容，" 真嗣诚实地回答。"就像是，我内心沉睡的东西现在正在苏醒。因为我的断腿，那些我记不起来的三个月里发生的事，一定又开始了。这是一种非常奇怪的感觉。"

"You seem normal enough to me," shrugged Asuka. "You done with that?" she asked as she pointed towards the bowl in his hand.

"在我看来你挺正常的，" 明日香耸了耸肩。"你吃完了吗？" 她指着他手里的碗问道。"

"Ah, yeah," replied Shinji as he passed her the bowl.

"啊，是的，" 真嗣回答着，把碗递给了她。"

Dumping the bowl outside, Asuka went back inside the tent and knelt down beside Shinji. Looking back at her questioningly, Shinji saw that Asuka was biting her lips slightly.

将碗丢在外面，明日香回到帐篷内，跪在真嗣旁边。真嗣疑惑地回头看她，只见明日香微微咬着嘴唇。

"Considering you've been inside the tent for two days, I thought you might want to stay outside for a while," began Asuka, "I've got the fire still going, and sitting beside it is more comfortable than staying in here so..."

“考虑到你已经在帐篷里待了两天，我想你可能想在外面待一会儿，”明日香开始说道，“火还在烧着，坐在旁边比待在这里舒服……”

Shinji gazed back at her rather stunned that she was suggesting this, though he was rather grateful. He had gotten annoyed with being cooped up in here the entire time.

真嗣有些惊讶地回望着她，尽管内心颇为感激。他早已厌倦了整日被困在这里。

"Thanks," said Shinji. “谢谢，”真嗣说道。

"Don't mention it," mumbled Asuka.

“别提了。”明日香咕哝道。

Thankfully, the tent was tall enough for them to stand nearly upright, and Shinji was able to place his arm around Asuka's shoulders as she led him outside. Shinji had actually forgotten, that it had once been his job to help Asuka like this when she hadn't been able to walk. That memory seemed so ancient now, even though it had hardly been two months.

幸运的是，帐篷足够高，他们几乎可以直立行走，而 Shinji 得以将手臂搭在 Asuka 的肩上，随着她一同走出帐外。Shinji 其实已经忘记了，曾经有一段时间，帮助无法行走的 Asuka 是他的职责。这段记忆如今显得如此遥远，尽管实际上不过才过去两个月。

As they reached the fire, Asuka gently lowered Shinji to the ground. Though it would have been nice if they actually had some logs to sit on, moving something like that here would have been too tiring.

当他们到达篝火旁时，明日香轻轻地将真嗣放在地上。虽然如果有几根木头可以坐坐会更好，但搬那种东西过来实在太累了。

"I'll brew some tea," said Asuka as she grabbed a kettle and several tea bags.

“我来泡点茶，”明日香说着，拿起水壶和几包茶袋。

"Sounds good," said Shinji as he stared into the depths of the fire. As Asuka busied herself, Shinji couldn't help but glance at her occasionally. He wondered if Asuka was thinking about the fact that their positions had changed. Well, even if she did, she probably wouldn't say anything.

“听起来不错，”真嗣说着，凝视着火堆深处。明日香忙着泡茶，真嗣忍不住偶尔瞥她一眼。他好奇明日香是否在想他们的角色已经互换了。嗯，即使她这么想，她大概也不会说什么。

Asuka passed a warm cup of tea to Shinji, and he clasped it between his hands, enjoying the added warmth. Though it was still early in the day, it was unbelievable how cold it had gotten. Sipping the tea slowly, he glanced at Asuka who had just poured her own cup, and was surprised when she walked over to him, and sat down beside him. Very rarely had they sat beside the fire together, and Shinji was very conscious about their arms brushing against each other.

明日香递给真嗣一杯温热的茶，他双手紧握，享受着这份额外的温暖。尽管时间尚早，但天气变得如此寒冷，实在令人难以置信。他慢慢啜饮着茶，瞥了一眼刚刚倒好自己那杯茶的明日香，当她走过来坐在他身边时，他感到惊讶。他们很少一起坐在火炉旁，真嗣非常在意他们的手臂相互触碰。

"Something wrong?" Shinji asked.

“有什么不对劲吗？”真嗣问道。

"No, not really," mumbled Asuka, "just wondering about a few things I guess."

“不，没什么，”明日香咕哝着，“只是有些事情在想。”

"...Like?" "...怎么样？"

"If the weather suddenly takes a turn for the worse is the first. We'd be unable to continue staying here most likely."

"如果天气突然恶化是第一个原因。我们很可能无法继续留在这里。"

"You have a point," nodded Shinji. "So then, did you have something in mind?"

"你说得有道理，" 真嗣点头道，"那么，你有什么想法吗？"

Asuka didn't immediately reply, debating with something internally.

明日香没有立即回答，内心在做着某种权衡。

"Well, you did say something before Shinji, about living in a house or apartment," said Asuka in a subdued voice

"嗯，你之前确实提到过，关于住在一栋房子或公寓里，" 明日香用低沉的声音说道

Shinji blinked several times after she said this. Was Asuka suggesting what he thought?

绫波说完后，真嗣眨了几次眼。难道明日香是在暗示他想的那个意思吗？

"Nothing permanent of course," said Asuka hurriedly. "Just in case it gets too cold...or starts snowing I guess. Somewhere warm to stay for the winter at least. I'd rather not freeze to death when there are thousands of empty houses around us."

“当然不是永久性的，”明日香急忙说道，“只是以防天气太冷……或者开始下雪什么的。至少找个暖和的地方过冬。周围有成千上万的空房子，我可不想冻死。”

"Hmm, you do have a point," agreed Shinji.

“嗯，你说得有道理，”真嗣同意道。

"Then we agree on that?"

"那么我们达成一致了？"

"Yeah, though someplace that has a fireplace as well would be welcome."

"是的，不过要是再有个壁炉的地方就更好了。"

"I suppose just staying in a house wouldn't be enough. Alright, thats settled at least."

"我想光是待在房子里还不够。好吧，至少这事解决了。"

"Was there something else you were thinking about?" asked Shinji

"你还在想别的事情吗？" 真嗣问道

"Ah...well...kinda, I guess. Its not really important though."

"啊...嗯...算是吧，我想。不过也不是很重要。"

Shinji glanced to his right at Asuka's face, trying to determine what expression she was making. She had her hands held tightly on the cup of tea, the same as his were. Her face didn't reveal any sort of worry though.

真嗣向右瞥了一眼明日香的表情，试图判断她此刻的心情。她和自己一样，双手紧紧握着茶杯。但她的脸上并没有显露出任何担忧的神色。

"If theres nothing else then..." muttered Shinji.

"如果没别的事了的话..." 真嗣喃喃道。

Asuka didn't reply as she stood up. She had debated on whether to ask Shinji about the strange feeling he had had, but wasn't sure how to brooch the subject. Either way, she wasn't sure what she could exactly say that would make him feel better.

明日香站起身，没有回答。她曾犹豫是否要问真嗣关于他那奇怪的感觉，但不确定如何开口。无论如何，她也不清楚自己能说什么来让他感觉好些。

'Jeez, I'm still worrying about him,' thought Asuka briefly before she poured the remaining tea from her cup into the fire.

'天哪，我还是担心他。' 明日香想着，顺手将杯中剩下的茶倒进了火里。

As the day waned on, and night grew closer, the temperature continued to drop. Asuka kept the fire roaring, so they still had a source of warmth at least. Without any clouds in sight either, it was reassuring that it wouldn't rain.

随着白昼渐逝，夜幕临近，气温持续下降。明日香不断添柴，让火势熊熊燃烧，至少他们还有温暖的来源。天空一片晴朗，没有一丝云彩，这让人安心，至少不会下雨。

They talked occasionally, but Asuka had given Shinji his SDAT at one point, and he had immersed himself in his music, while Asuka had continued reading her book. This continued for sometime until Asuka asked what Shinji wanted for dinner. Having never been asked this question by anybody, Shinji wasn't sure how to reply. Inevitably, Shinji just shrugged and told Asuka whatever she made would be fine. This wasn't the answer Asuka had wanted, but she sighed all the same and started cooking.

他们偶尔交谈，但明日香曾把 SDAT 交给真嗣，他便沉浸在自己的音乐中，而明日香继续读她的书。这种情况持续了一段时间，直到明日香问真嗣晚餐想吃什么。从未有人问过他这个问题，真嗣不知如何回答。最终，真嗣只是耸了耸肩，告诉明日香她做什么都行。这并非明日香想要的答案，但她还是叹了口气，开始做饭。

Being this the first time Shinji had seen Asuka cook, he couldn't help but glance at her when she had her back turned to him. Once or twice, their eyes crossed paths, and Shinji thought he caught a small smirk from Asuka's lips every time this happened. He wasn't vocal about what she was doing like yesterday, but this was because he was much more calm. Though still unable to move as he pleased, at least he wasn't stuck in that tent like a caged bird.

这是真嗣第一次见明日香做饭，当她背对着他时，他忍不住偷瞄了几眼。有一两次，他们的目光交汇，真嗣觉得每次这样时，明日香嘴角都掠过一丝浅笑。他不像昨天那样对她的举动发表意见，这是因为他的心情平静了许多。尽管仍不能自由行动，但至少他不再像笼中鸟一样被困在帐篷里。

The aroma of something began wafting in Shinji's direction, and he even removed his earbuds to concentrate better on the smell. It was familiar to him in a certain way, but not because somebody else had cooked it for him before. Call it something that was usual for Japanese culture. Seeing Asuka cook it though...needless to say, their was an unusual feeling engraved within him.

某种香气开始飘向真嗣的方向，他甚至摘下了耳塞，以便更专注地感受这股味道。这味道对他来说有种熟悉感，但并非因为别人曾为他烹制过。可以说是日本文化中常见的一种食物。但看到明日香在烹饪它……不得不说，他心中刻下了一种异样的感觉。

Seeing Shinji looking towards her, Asuka couldn't help but ask, "Did you recognize it?"

看到真嗣朝她望来，明日香忍不住问道：“你认出来了吗？”

"Yeah, but I'm more surprised that you managed to make fried rice without a wok."

“嗯，但我更惊讶的是你居然在没有炒锅的情况下做出了炒饭。”

"Well, it certainly wasn't easy. And I wouldn't necessarily call it fried rice since it doesn't have egg or any kind of meat. Not to mention, that without a wok, a lot of the rice stuck to the pot itself. I'm actually surprised you never thought to find one."

"嗯，确实不容易。而且我不能说这是炒饭，因为它没有鸡蛋也没有任何肉类。更别提，没有炒锅，很多米饭都粘在锅上了。我其实很惊讶你从没想过要找一个。"

"It never crossed my mind honestly," said Shinji. "Still it smells really good."

"老实说，我从没想过，" 真嗣说。"不过闻起来真的很香。"

Asuka didn't reply, mainly because her cheeks had heated up at his complement.

明日香没有回答，主要是因为他的夸赞让她脸颊发热。

Moments later, the fried rice was done, and Asuka scooped the rice into two bowls. Shinji had said before that rice was one thing they'd never have any problems acquiring, so Asuka wasn't stingy on the portions. Asuka passed Shinji a bowl, and he immediately began eating. The steamed vegetables and rice blended well together, and Asuka had sautéed the vegetables in a minute amount of soy sauce to give it extra flavor.

片刻后，炒饭完成了，明日香将米饭盛入两个碗中。真嗣之前说过，米饭是他们永远不会缺少的东西，所以明日香并不吝啬分量。她递给真嗣一碗，他立刻开始吃起来。蒸熟的蔬菜和米饭搭配得很好，明日香用少量酱油炒制蔬菜，增添了额外的风味。

"I take it you like it?" asked Asuka.

“看来你很喜欢？”明日香问道。

"Yeah, its really good." “嗯，真的很好吃。”

"Hmmm," muttered Asuka rather absent minded.

"嗯……" 明日香心不在焉地咕哝道。

"Something wrong?" asked Shinji, surprised by her lack of response.

"有什么不对劲吗？" 真嗣问道，对她的沉默感到惊讶。

"Nope," said Asuka as she sat down beside him; she was smiling slightly.

"没有，" 明日香说着坐在他旁边；她的嘴角微微上扬。

Once again, Shinji was surprised by Asuka's decision to sit beside him. Since the whole event with the building collapsing, Asuka's attitude towards him seemed to have changed. Shinji wondered why that was, but didn't feel like asking either. He wasn't afraid of the answer, he just didn't think Asuka would supply an answer. Well, her actions were enough he supposed.

又一次，真嗣对明日香选择坐在他旁边感到惊讶。自从那栋大楼倒塌的事件发生后，明日香对他的态度似乎发生了变化。真嗣不知道为什么会这样，但也没打算问。他并不害怕答案，只是觉得明日香不会给出答案。嗯，她的行动本身就足够了，他想。

They ate in relative silence as they were want to do, their arms and shoulders constantly bumping into each other as they maneuvered their spoons from the bowl to their mouths. Though Shinji felt a hint of embarrassment, he couldn't deny that sitting beside Asuka like this, with the fire blazing in front of them, and a bowl of rice each between them was relaxing. If days like this could continue, that would be enough for Shinji.

他们相对沉默地吃着，这是他们惯常的相处方式。在用勺子从碗里舀食物到嘴里的过程中，两人的手臂和肩膀不时碰撞。尽管真嗣感到一丝尴尬，但他无法否认，坐在明日香旁边，面前是熊熊燃烧的火焰，两人之间各有一碗米饭，这样的时刻让人感到放松。如果这样的日子能继续下去，对真嗣来说已经足够了。

That thought though, would never hold, and Shinji probably knew it wouldn't. Something was different about him, and he could feel it growing inside of him nearly every minute. He hadn't mentioned it to Asuka, because he didn't want to worry her further; he had done enough of that in the past two days. Eventually, the subject would be brought up though, whether he wanted it to or not.

然而，这个念头注定无法持久，真嗣大概也知道这一点。他身上有些不同了，他能几乎每时每刻感受到这种变化在内心滋长。他没有向明日香提起，因为他不想让她更加担忧；过去的两天里，他已经让她够操心了。但终究，这个话题会被提起，无论他是否愿意。

After they finished, Asuka placed the two bowls to the side and covered up the pot. There was still a lot of the rice left, and it would likely become their breakfast tomorrows. Sitting back beside Shinji, she stretched her arms upwards, looking as though she was reaching for the sky.

他们吃完后，明日香将两个碗放到一旁，盖上了锅盖。锅里还剩下不少米饭，大概会成为他们明天的早餐。她回到真嗣身边坐下，双臂向上伸展，仿佛在触碰天空。

"You seem to be in a good mood," remarked Shinji.

"你看起来心情不错，"真嗣评论道。

"Do I?" asked Asuka. "Maybe I am, I'm not really sure."

"是吗？" 明日香问道。"也许我是吧，我也不太确定。"

She laughed lightly at that, and Shinji felt himself smiling.

她对此轻声笑了笑，这让真嗣也不由自主地微笑起来。

Afterwards, Asuka helped Shinji back to the tent since it was getting increasingly darker. Returning outside, Asuka battled on whether to extinguish the fire or not for nearly a minute, until she decide it was best to douse it. It was smarter than on the off chance it would run wild.

之后，由于天色越来越暗，明日香帮助真嗣回到了帐篷。回到外面，明日香纠结了近一分钟是否要熄灭火堆，最终她决定最好还是将其扑灭。这样做比万一火势失控要明智得多。

Crawling back into the tent, Asuka frowned as she saw Shinji attempting to insert his injured leg into the sleeping bag. Sighing, Asuka knelt down to help him.

爬回帐篷，明日香皱着眉头看到真嗣正试图将他受伤的腿塞进睡袋。叹了口气，明日香跪下来帮他。

"Hear, let me do it," mumbled Asuka.

“听着，我来弄吧，”明日香咕哝道。

"No, I can do this myself," retorted Shinji rather stubbornly.

“不，我自己能行，”真嗣相当固执地反驳道。

Asuka was reminded of a somewhat similar situation, where their roles had been reversed. It was like some force was toying with their lives.

明日香想起了某个颇为相似的情景，那时他们的角色互换了。仿佛有一股力量在玩弄他们的生活。

"Remember when I couldn't get my shoes on, and you had to help me?"

“记得我穿不上鞋子，你帮我穿的那次吗？”

Shinji pause as Asuka said this; did something like that happen? He couldn't remember it very well if it had.

听到明日香这么说，真嗣顿了一下；这样的事发生过吗？如果有，他也记不太清楚了。

"Seems like you forgot," said Asuka as she gently picked up Shinji's leg and helped him move it into the sleeping bag. "I still remember it though," said Asuka as she continued speaking, "because it was probably the moment when I felt the most helpless. I wasn't able to do even a simple thing like putting my shoes on. I hated how you helped me back then, but it doesn't bother me anymore. Basically, let me repay you for those times right now, at least until your leg is healed."

"看来你忘了，"明日香轻柔地抬起真嗣的腿，帮他挪进睡袋里。"我可还记得呢，"她继续说道，"因为那大概是我感到最无助的时刻。连穿鞋这么简单的事都做不到。那时我讨厌你的帮助，但现在无所谓了。总之，让我现在回报你那些时候的恩情，至少到你的腿痊愈为止。"

"Asuka, I would have managed it eventually. And you don't have to repay me for anything," complained Shinji.

“明日香，我最终会自己搞定的。你不必为我做任何事来回报我，”真嗣抱怨道。

"Quiet," said Asuka harshly. "I'm doing this for you whether you want me to or not."

“安静，”明日香严厉地说，“不管你愿不愿意，我这么做都是为了你。”

Shinji looked back at Asuka, but there wasn't any way to get past her stubbornness. Resigning himself, Shinji leaned backwards onto the ground and mumbled something inaudibly.

真嗣回头看向明日香，但她的固执是无法逾越的。无奈之下，真嗣向后仰躺在地上，含糊地咕哝了几句听不清的话。

"What did you say?" asked Asuka, her eyebrows raising.

"你说什么？" 明日香问道，眉头一挑。

"Nothing," said Shinji hurriedly.

"没什么，" 真嗣急忙说。

"You just called me stubborn, didn't you." Her voice had grown sharp.

"你刚才说我固执，对吧。" 她的声音变得尖锐起来。

"No, I-" “不，我——”

Shinji was cut off as Asuka pinched his cheek hard.

真嗣话还没说完，就被明日香狠狠地捏了一下脸颊。

"Ow! Asuka quit it!" "哎哟！明日香，别闹了！"

"Can't you just shut up and not open your mouth for once!"

"你就不能闭嘴一次，别张嘴吗！"

Asuka let go and turned around in a huff, retreating towards her own sleeping bag. Laying down on it, she didn't say another word to Shinji. Shinji had almost forgotten what it was like to see Asuka angry, and so this sudden change surprised him somewhat. Course, her words as well hung above him as he remembered them. Was it because he had called her stubborn, or was it another reason entirely?

明日香气呼呼地松开手，转身朝自己的睡袋走去。她躺下后，没再对真嗣说一句话。真嗣几乎忘了看到明日香生气是什么感觉，因此这突如其来的变化让他有些惊讶。当然，她的话也萦绕在他心头，他回想着。是因为他称她固执，还是另有原因？

"Well, its not like she'll stay mad at me."

“嗯，她不会一直生我的气。”

Shinji was right about this, as later on during the night, when they had both fallen asleep, Shinji found himself turning in his sleeping bag, his two legs intertwining, and the sharp pain from his injured one awaking him. He heard something else though, and looked towards his right. His eyes hadn't adjusted to the darkness, but he could barely make out the thin outline of somebody near him.

正如真嗣所料，夜深时分，两人都已入睡，真嗣在睡袋中辗转反侧，双腿交缠，受伤的那条腿传来的剧痛将他惊醒。然而，他还听到了其他声响，便朝右侧望去。他的眼睛尚未适应黑暗，但隐约能辨认出近旁有个纤细的身影。

"Sorry...did I wake you?" asked Asuka. She was sitting up, and looked as though she had been in the process of moving her sleeping bag.

“对不起……我吵醒你了吗？”明日香问道。她正坐起身，看起来似乎正打算移动她的睡袋。

"No," said Shinji as he shook his head, noticing her tone. "I bumped my injured leg is all."

“不，”真嗣摇着头说，注意到她的语气。“只是撞到了我受伤的腿。”

"...I see," said Asuka as she looked away from him.

"...我明白了," 明日香说着，将目光从他身上移开。

Silence engulfed them, and Shinji was unsure whether he should ask the question which seemed relevant at the moment. Something else distracted him though. Looking up at the tent, he hadn't noticed it before, but now could hear the quiet sound of rain sprinkling down onto their tent.

沉默笼罩着他们，真嗣不确定是否应该问那个此刻似乎相关的问题。不过，有其他东西分散了他的注意力。抬头望向帐篷，他之前没有注意到，但现在能听到雨轻轻洒落在帐篷上的声音。

"Its raining?" wondered Shinji out loud.

"下雨了吗？" 真嗣自言自语道。

"Mmm," was all Asuka replied.

"嗯，" 明日香只回了这么一句。

Shinji noticed something else then; the cold that was revolving around was undeniable. Was that it then?

真嗣随后注意到了另一件事；那围绕着他们的寒冷是无可否认的。这就是了吗？

"Are you cold?" asked Shinji.

"你冷吗？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka didn't reply, her gaze fixed towards the front of the tent. Well, Shinji didn't have a problem with what Asuka had been about to do. It wasn't as though it was a first for them anyway.

明日香没有回答，她的目光固定在帐篷的前方。嗯，真嗣并不介意明日香即将要做的事情。反正这对他们来说也不是第一次了。

Slowly, Shinji rolled onto his side facing away from Asuka. Predictably, Shinji heard the quite movements as Asuka neared him, and then, heard a small 'thud' as Asuka lay down beside him. Her back was pressed against his, and his against hers. It was surprising how the distance between them had shrunk to what it was now.

慢慢地，真嗣侧身背对着明日香躺下。不出所料，真嗣听到了明日香靠近他的轻微动静，然后，听到了一声轻微的“咚”声，明日香躺在了他身边。她的背紧贴着他的，他的背也紧贴着她的。令人惊讶的是，他们之间的距离已经缩小到了现在这样。

"Thanks," came Asuka's voice directly next to him.

“谢谢，”明日香的声音直接在他旁边响起。

"Don't be thanking me, and don't worry about this either. If you're cold...don't hesitate to..."

“不必谢我，这事也别放在心上。要是觉得冷……尽管开口……”

Shinji left his sentence hanging, unsure what he had been about to say. Was there anything for him to say though? No, he supposed there really wasn't. Course, he could only assume what would happen when he awoke in the morning. He'd worry about that when it happened.

真嗣话说到一半就停住了，不确定自己原本要说什么。但他真的有话要说吗？不，他觉得其实并没有。当然，他只能猜测明天醒来会发生什么。到时候再担心吧。

Maybe because his leg wasn't as painful as the night before, but Shinji found it easier to fall back asleep. Beside him, Asuka found it similarly easy, but for a different reason entirely.

也许是因为他的腿不像前一晚那么疼了，真嗣发现自己更容易再次入睡。在他旁边，明日香也觉得同样容易，但原因完全不同。

Asuka was first to awake, and briefly wished that she hadn't. The first thing she saw was Shinji's face directly next to hers, and you probably would have expected her to shout, groan, or hit him. She did none of these things, except simply frown at his sleeping face before sitting up. Resting the palm of her hand against her cheek, she glanced down at his sleeping face, wondering why they always ended up that way. Well, whatever.

明日香第一个醒来，并短暂地希望自己没有醒来。她第一眼看到的是真嗣的脸紧挨着她，你可能会以为她会大喊、呻吟或打他。她什么也没做，只是对着他熟睡的脸皱了皱眉，然后坐了起来。她用手掌托着脸颊，低头看着他熟睡的脸，想知道为什么他们总是这样。唉，无所谓了。

Getting up properly took several attempts. Though the rain had stopped, the air was bone chilling and the ground had frosted over. Once or twice, Asuka even lay back down beside Shinji, before sitting promptly back upright. It was incredibly cold, but if she started moving around, at least she would warm up. That and getting the fire relit was necessary.

好好站起来花了好几次尝试。虽然雨已经停了，但空气冷得刺骨，地面也结了霜。有一两次，明日香甚至又躺回真嗣身边，然后立刻又坐直了。天气冷得要命，但如果她开始活动，至少能暖和些。还有就是重新点燃篝火也是必要的。

As she started to get the fire lit, she alternated between warming up her hands by shoving them into the pocket of her jeans, and trying to have the flame from the lighter catch. By the time she had final got the fire going, she could hardly feel her hands, and spent several minutes holding them close to the fire to warm them up.

当她开始点火时，她交替着把手伸进牛仔裤口袋里取暖，和试着让打火机的火焰点燃。等到她终于把火生起来时，她的手几乎感觉不到了，花了好几分钟把手靠近火边取暖。

She reheated the fried rice they she had made last night, and ate her own portion first. As she did this, she looked up to the sky, and couldn't help but shiver briefly. The rain had stopped, but the dark clouds were still hanging overhead. If the sky were to suddenly open up, Asuka was worried that they may have to leave. Even if it didn't though, she didn't know how much longer they could deal with this cold.

她重新加热了昨晚自己做的炒饭，先吃了自己的那份。吃着吃着，她抬头望向天空，不禁打了个寒颤。雨已经停了，但乌云依旧密布。如果天空突然放晴，明日香担心他们可能得离开。即便如此，她也不清楚他们还能忍受这寒冷多久。

She busied herself around their camp, trying to keep herself occupied until Shinji woke up, all the while glancing upwards towards the sky. It was nearly an hour later when she heard movement from the tent, and looked over to see Shinji's head poking through the front flap of the tent.

她在营地周围忙碌着，试图让自己保持忙碌直到真嗣醒来，同时不时抬头望向天空。将近一个小时后，她听到帐篷里有动静，转头一看，只见真嗣的头从帐篷前帘探了出来。

"What are you doing?" asked Asuka as she walked over to him.

“你在做什么？”明日香走过去问道。

"Seeing what you were doing," replied Shinji

“看到你在做什么了。” 真嗣回答道

"Thats not what I meant," said Asuka as she shook her head. "Why are you moving around?"

“我不是那个意思，”明日香摇着头说，“你为什么在动来动去？”

"I'm not putting any weight on my bad leg if that is what you're asking."

“如果这就是你想问的，我并没有用我受伤的腿承重。”

Inspecting further, Asuka saw that Shinji had used his sleep bag to slide across the ground, and used his arms to pull him forward.

仔细一看，明日香发现真嗣是用睡袋在地上滑行，用双臂拖着自己前进。

"You really are an idiot, you know that?" sighed Asuka.

"你真是个白痴，知道吗？" 明日香叹息道。

Shinji didn't reply though, because he had noticed the dark sky, and was looking up at it. Noticing this, Asuka followed her gaze and looked upwards as well.

但真嗣没有回答，因为他注意到了阴沉的天空，正抬头望着它。注意到这一点，明日香也顺着他的目光向上看去。

"That doesn't look very good," said Shinji.

"那看起来不太妙，" 真嗣说道。

"No...I didn't think so either."

"不...我也这么觉得。"

Directing his gaze towards Asuka, Shinji voiced his opinion.

真嗣将目光转向明日香，表达了自己的看法。

"Maybe we should leave before it starts raining. It may be smarter than to risk a sudden downpour. And I don't know if you'll be able to get me up the slope once it starts raining."

"也许我们应该在下雨前离开。冒险遭遇突如其来的暴雨可能不太明智。而且我不知道一旦下雨，你还能不能把我拉上斜坡。"

Asuka hadn't thought about that, but Shinji certainly had a point. Maybe it was better for them to leave now.

明日香之前并未考虑到这一点，但真嗣说得确实有道理。或许他们现在离开会更好。

"Okay, you eat then while I start packing," said Asuka as she grabbed what remained of the fried rice and handed it to Shinji.

"好了，你先吃，我来打包，" 明日香说着，抓起剩下的炒饭递给了真嗣。

"Hmm, okay." "嗯，好的。"

While Shinji ate, Asuka started gathering up everything they collectively owned, and began storing it all in the car. It was amazing how much stuff they had accumulated over the course of the two months they had been together, and Asuka made many trips to the car until all that was left was to pack away the tent. Before doing that though, Asuka helped Shinji to his feet, and led him up the sloping hill. It was difficult, and Asuka was glad that Shinji had suggested they did this before the ground got slippery. Even without the ground being wet, Asuka still had difficulty getting Shinji up the hill.

真嗣吃饭的时候，明日香开始收拾他们共同拥有的所有东西，并把它们装进车里。令人惊讶的是，仅仅两个月的时间，他们就积攒了这么多东西。明日香多次往返于车和营地之间，直到只剩下帐篷还没打包。不过在那之前，明日香扶起真嗣，带他走上斜坡。这很困难，明日香很庆幸真嗣建议他们在地面变滑之前做这件事。即使地面没有湿滑，明日香仍然费了很大劲才把真嗣扶上坡。

Once Shinji was safe inside the car, Asuka spent several minutes disassembling the tent. She was further glad they had decide to move sooner then later, when it started to rain. It started slowly, and then began picking up. Quickly, Asuka's hair and clothes became soaked through, and it was only the warmth of the sweatshirt that prevented her from shivering immensely. Hoping that she wouldn't catch a cold, she finished rolling up the tent, and slung it over her shoulder, carrying it up the hill and storing it away in the car.

当真嗣安全进入车内后，明日香花了好几分钟拆解帐篷。当开始下雨时，她更加庆幸他们决定早点离开。雨起初下得很慢，然后逐渐加大。很快，明日香的头发和衣服都湿透了，只有运动衫的温暖才让她没有剧烈颤抖。她希望自己不会感冒，于是迅速卷起帐篷，扛在肩上，爬上山坡，将其存放在车里。

Entering through the driver side door, Asuka sat down and grabbed a towel from the back and quickly dried her hair.

明日香从驾驶座车门进入，坐下后从后座抓起一条毛巾，迅速擦干头发。

"You were right Shinji," began Asuka as she continued drying her hair. "It was a good thing we left when we did."

“你是对的，真嗣，”明日香一边继续擦干头发一边说道，“我们及时离开真是太好了。”

"Now what though?" asked Shinji.

"现在怎么办呢？" 真嗣问道。

"Leave that to me," said Asuka as she started the car, and threw it into gear.

"交给我吧，" 明日香说着启动了汽车，猛地挂上挡。

As they left the park, the downpour started, and the windshield of their car was quickly being peppered by large droplets of rain. Still, Asuka drove onward calmly, ignoring the rain pounding against the car. Unfortunately for them though, the station wagon they were driving lacked a heater, and the inside of the car quickly became cold. Shinji tried his best to remain warm, by tucking his arms into the inside of his shirt, but even that didn't help. Asuka on the other hand was driving, and her clothes were still thoroughly soaked. Still, she didn't complain once.

当他们离开公园时，暴雨骤至，车前挡风玻璃很快被大雨滴打得噼啪作响。尽管如此，明日香依然镇定地继续驾驶，无视雨水猛烈敲打车身的声音。然而不幸的是，他们所驾驶的旅行车没有暖气，车内迅速变得寒冷。真嗣尽力保持温暖，将双臂缩进衬衫里，但即便如此也无济于事。另一方面，明日香正在开车，她的衣服依旧湿透。尽管如此，她却未曾抱怨一句。

As they drove, Shinji couldn't help but wonder what Asuka had in mind. She had said to leave it to her, but did she actually have an idea where they were headed? Well, Shinji decided to just trust her.

当他们驾车前行时，真嗣忍不住好奇阿斯卡心里在想什么。她说过交给她就好，但她真的知道他们要去哪儿吗？嗯，真嗣决定还是相信她。

They drove around for another twenty minutes until Asuka turned right, taking them down a residential street. Parking the car in front of a house, Asuka got out and turned towards Shinji.

他们又开了二十分钟，直到明日香向右转，驶入一条住宅街道。在一家房子前停好车后，明日香下了车，转身面向真嗣。

"Wait here for a bit, I'm gonna look around at some of these houses. Hopefully one of them has a fireplace that isn't electric."

在这里稍等片刻，我去看看这些房子。希望其中一间有不是电力的壁炉。

Shinji nodded, and watched her run up to the first house on the block, hoping that she would be careful.

真嗣点点头，看着她跑向街区上的第一栋房子，希望她能小心些。

They had never been in this block of houses before, so the first thing that Asuka was forced to do was break in. They had broken into houses before, either by kicking in the front door, breaking a window, or something else. Some houses didn't require this, and that made Asuka suspect that when Third Impact had happened, some people had been inside their houses when they had vanished. Therefore, she was pleasantly surprised when she tried the front door, and the knob turned, letting her enter.

他们从未踏足过这片街区，所以明日香不得不做的第一件事就是闯入。他们以前也闯过房子，要么是踢开前门，要么打破窗户，或者其他什么方法。有些房子则不需要这样，这让明日香怀疑，在第三次冲击发生时，有些人可能就在屋内消失了。因此，当她试着转动前门把手，门竟然开了，让她得以进入时，她感到意外的惊喜。

Passing through the front door, she ascended up two small carpeted steps and stepped into what must have been the living room. A large, flatscreen T.V. gleamed back at her that hung on a far wall to her left. Directly in front of that was a large couch, capable of seating three people. A large bookcase covered the wall to the right of the couch, and on the left, was a large window that showed the corner of the residential street.

穿过前门，她踏上两级铺着地毯的小台阶，走进了应该是客厅的地方。一台挂在远处左侧墙上的大屏幕电视闪闪发光。正前方是一张能容纳三人的大沙发。沙发右侧是一整面墙的书架，左侧则是一扇大窗户，可以看到住宅街的拐角。

Asuka glanced at the many photos that hung on the walls around the living room, determining that a couple in their sixties used to live here. Photos of their children, and grandchildren pocketed the many different photos, along with other relatives. None of it mattered anymore, and this made Asuka slightly sad.

明日香环视着客厅墙上挂着的众多照片，判断这里曾住着一对六十多岁的夫妇。他们的子女和孙辈的照片点缀在各种其他亲属的照片之间。但现在这一切都不再重要，这让明日香感到一丝悲伤。

Attempting to ignore this, she entered into the kitchen which was divided by a wall, separating the living room from itself. A repugnant smell hit Asuka then, and she recoiled as she fought the urge to vomit. She didn't dare open the refrigerator, knowing what she would find.

她试图忽略这些，走进了用墙隔开客厅的厨房。一股令人作呕的气味随即扑面而来，明日香不由得后退，强忍着呕吐的冲动。她不敢打开冰箱，知道里面会有什么。

Leaving this room, she entered back into the living room and then went down a long hallway. At the very end of the hallway was the master bedroom, but she ignored this and entered into the guest bedroom instead. A single bed sat in the far corner of the room, and was clearly meant to be for a child. The bedsheets had some cartoon characters face plastered over it that Asuka didn't recognize, though it must have been something unique to Japan. Looking at the rest of the room, there was a small dresser with a mirror above it, and several toys scattered across the floor. After seeing this, Asuka backed out of the room, unwilling to think who might have once been here.

离开这间房，她回到了客厅，然后穿过一条长长的走廊。走廊尽头是主卧室，但她并未理会，而是走进了客卧。房间远角摆放着一张单人床，显然是为孩子准备的。床单上印着一些明日香不认识的卡通人物，想必是日本特有的。环顾四周，房间里有一个带镜子的矮柜，地板上散落着几件玩具。看到这些，明日香退出了房间，不愿去想曾经住在这里的人是谁。

Walking down the rest of the hallway, she entered into the master bedroom. A king size bed took up much of the back wall, and a small table sat on either side. Several magazines covered one, while a simple alarm clock sat on the other. A large dresser was on the wall opposite of the bed, and Asuka briefly thought about going through it. A walk in closet was off to the side as well, beside a large bathroom, but Asuka decided that she would stop here. It was clear that this house didn't have a fireplace.

她沿着走廊继续前行，进入了主卧室。一张占据了大半面墙的特大号床映入眼帘，两侧各摆放着一张小桌。一张桌上散落着几本杂志，而另一张桌上则仅有一个简单的闹钟。床对面的墙上立着一个大衣柜，明日香短暂地考虑过是否要翻看一番。旁边还有一个步入式衣帽间，紧挨着一间宽敞的浴室，但明日香决定就此打住。显然，这栋房子并没有壁炉。

Leaving the house, she closed the front door and glanced towards the car. She saw Shinji sitting in the passenger seat, and his head turned towards her briefly. Asuka shook her head as there eyes made contact and Shinji nodded briefly before slouching back into his seat, trying to keep warm.

离开房子，她关上前门，向车子望去。看到真嗣坐在副驾驶座上，他的头短暂地转向她。明日香摇了摇头，两人的目光交汇，真嗣简短地点头示意后便又缩回座位，试图取暖。

The rain continued coming down around Asuka as she walked from one house to the next, crossing back and forth across the street, looking for a house that had a fireplace. Each time she left a house, she locked eyes with Shinji and shook her head. She had already done this six times, and was wondering if she shouldn't just try driving someplace else. Every house they had entered before didn't have a fireplace that she could remember though, so she didn't have a clue as to where to start.

雨依旧在明日香身边落下，她从一栋房子走到另一栋，来回穿梭在街道上，寻找着一间有壁炉的房子。每次她离开一户人家，都会与真嗣对视并摇头。她已经这样试了六次，开始怀疑是否应该干脆开车去别的地方。尽管之前他们进过的每栋房子她都不记得有壁炉，但她毫无头绪该从何找起。

As she entered the seventh house on the left side of the street, she paused, and glanced upwards, looking at the clouds. The rain was still coming down around her, and Asuka had started sneezing occasionally. She had hoped that it would let up for a while, just so that she could dry herself off. Nature didn't seem to want to conform to her wishes however.

当她走进街道左侧的第七栋房子时，她停下脚步，抬头望向云层。雨水依旧在她周围落下，明日香偶尔开始打喷嚏。她曾希望雨能暂时停歇，好让她能晾干自己。然而，大自然似乎并不打算顺应她的愿望。

Stepping through the threshold of the front door, her eyes immediately latched onto a square opening, cut out against the wall on the far left side of where she was standing. Asuka almost felt like laughing when she saw this, and walked over, running her hand across the mantlepiece. A thick layer of dust was blown off, covering the stone floor in front of the fireplace. Kneeling down, she examined the fireplace closer, opening the glass panel. Charcoaled wood was still placed inside, but would unlikely catch. Against the wall, directly next to the fireplace, was a fire poker, and further on down against the wall, was a small iron cage, that had several piece of dry firewood stacked there.

踏进前门的那一刻，她的目光立刻被左侧墙壁上的一处方形开口吸引。看到这个，明日香几乎有种想笑的冲动，她走过去，伸手拂过壁炉台。一层厚厚的灰尘被吹落，覆盖在壁炉前的石地板上。她跪下来仔细检查壁炉，打开玻璃挡板。里面还放着炭化的木头，但不太可能点燃。紧贴着壁炉旁边的墙上挂着一根拨火棍，再往远处，墙边放着一个装有几块干柴的小铁笼。

Trying to hold back the joy that was filling her, Asuka examined the rest of the house. The ceiling that hung above her was low hanging, which would mean that the heat from the fire would circulate longer in the enclosed space. A couch for two was placed several paces away from the fireplace, with several armchairs and tables placed evenly throughout. To the left of this, was a window and in front of that, was a glass table that had a small lamp with many pictures on it. Asuka examined these briefly, before pulling her gaze away.

努力压抑着满溢的喜悦，明日香仔细打量着房子的其他部分。头顶的吊顶较低，这意味着火炉的热量会在封闭的空间内循环更久。一张双人沙发摆放在离壁炉几步之遥的地方，周围均匀分布着几把扶手椅和桌子。左侧是一扇窗户，窗前则是一张玻璃桌，桌上放着一盏小灯和许多照片。明日香匆匆扫过这些照片，随即移开了视线。

Checking the other rooms in the house, Asuka realized that this house had two living rooms, one which had the fireplace, and another which had a flatscreen T.V. resting on a stand. This other living room was significantly smaller, and only had a single couch in it with a table beside the T.V.

检查了房子里的其他房间后，明日香意识到这栋房子有两间客厅，一间设有壁炉，另一间则摆放着一台平板电视，置于支架上。另一间客厅明显较小，仅有一张沙发和一张电视旁的桌子。

Leaving this second living room, Asuka checked the kitchen. Unfortunately, it had an electric stove, so cooking on that was out of the question. Checking the many wooden cupboards, she was pleasantly surprised to find a large assortment of china, complete with plates, bowls, and cups. Asuka found a drawer of silverware as well, with several utensils that she knew they didn't have. Checking a bottom cupboard, she found several more pots and pans along with a large mixing bowl. All in all, most of these things she found were useful. She purposefully stayed away from the refrigerator, even though she didn't smell anything coming from it.

离开这间次客厅，明日香检查了厨房。不幸的是，那里装有电炉，所以用它来烹饪是不可能的。她打开许多木制橱柜，惊喜地发现里面有各式各样的瓷器，包括盘子、碗和杯子。明日香还找到了一个装有银器的抽屉，里面有几件她知道他们没有的餐具。在底部的橱柜里，她又发现了几个锅和平底锅，以及一个大搅拌碗。总的来说，她找到的这些东西大多都很实用。她故意避开了冰箱，尽管她没有闻到任何从里面传出的异味。

Leaving the kitchen, she approached the large staircase. The railing was made of oak, and the stairs were carpeted. She climbed the first flight, and then turned on the landing, climbing the second set of stairs. Fours different doors stretched outwards before her. She chose the closest one on her right and opened it. A gleaming white bathroom appeared before her eyes. Asuka suddenly wished she could take a bath for once, but knew that such a thing was impossible without plumbing.

离开厨房，她走向那座宽敞的楼梯。扶手由橡木制成，楼梯铺着地毯。她爬上第一段楼梯，然后在平台处转弯，继续攀登第二段楼梯。四扇不同的门在她面前展开。她选择了右手边最近的一扇，推开门。眼前出现了一个闪闪发亮的白色浴室。明日香突然希望自己能洗个澡，但知道没有管道设施这是不可能的。

Returning to the hallway, she entered the door directly across from the bathroom and entered. Clearly a guest bedroom, with little decor if any, except the single bed, dresser and mirror. Opening the small closet, there wasn't even a single article of clothing.

回到走廊，她径直走进对面那扇门，进入了一个显然是客房的房间。除了单人床、梳妆台和镜子外，几乎没有装饰。打开小衣柜，里面甚至连一件衣服都没有。

Leaving this room, she walked down the hallway and opened the door on her left, another room, this one seeming to be for a child. A crib was against the wall closest to Asuka, and on the other end, was a small bed. Asuka remembered the photos she had seen earlier, remembering the face of the couple and their two daughters. Trying to ignore the strange feeling in the pit of her stomach, Asuka entered into the last room, being the master bedroom.

离开这个房间后，她沿着走廊走到左边，打开了另一扇门，这间房看起来像是儿童房。阿斯卡靠近的那面墙边放着一个婴儿床，另一头则是一张小床。阿斯卡回想起之前看过的照片，记起了那对夫妇和他们的两个女儿的面孔。她努力忽略胃里那种奇怪的感觉，走进了最后一个房间，也就是主卧室。

It was certainly the largest of the three bedrooms, complete with a king sized bed, two large dressers, and a single mirror. A side door was across from the bed, and Asuka opened this to reveal an adjacent bathroom. Ignoring this, Asuka returned to the bed, and crawled onto it, standing up. A single window hung above the bed, and if Asuka stood on her tiptoes, she could see the street below her, along with Shinji waiting in the car. Thinking the time was right to share this with him, she left the bedroom, jogged down the stairs, and left through the front door.

这无疑是三间卧室中最大的一间，配有一张特大号床、两个大衣柜和一面镜子。床对面有一扇侧门，Asuka 打开它，露出了相邻的浴室。她没有理会，回到床边，爬了上去，站起身来。床上方有一扇窗户，如果 Asuka 踮起脚尖，她可以看到下面的街道，还有 Shinji 在车里等待。她觉得是时候和他分享这一切了，于是她离开了卧室，小跑下楼，从前门出去了。

Shinji saw her approaching, and was surprised that she was running, despite clearly having the rain and wind whipping against her face. Rolling down the window, Shinji was about to ask her what happened, but before he even got a chance to, Asuka cut him off.

Shinji 看到她走近，惊讶地发现她在奔跑，尽管雨水和风正猛烈地打在她的脸上。他摇下车窗，正要问她发生了什么事，但还没等他有机会开口，Asuka 就打断了他。

"Shinji," started Asuka breathlessly, "I...found a...house with a fireplace. I think it'll work."

"真嗣," 明日香喘着气开始说, "我...找到了一个...带壁炉的房子。我觉得能行。"

"You did?" said Shinji, his mouth slightly open.

"真的吗？" 真嗣说道，嘴巴微微张开。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Without further explanation, Asuka jumped into the drivers seat, started the ignition, and drove a short ways down the street before she parked in the driveway of the house. The house had a garage, but Asuka hadn't even bothered to check that yet.

没有多余的解释，Asuka 跳进了驾驶座，启动引擎，沿着街道短暂行驶后便停在了房子前的车道上。房子有车库，但 Asuka 甚至还没费心去检查。

Getting out of the car, Asuka went around the side and opened the passenger door, helping Shinji out, and led him up the front steps to the door. The house was of western design, light grey with white trim around the windows and door frame. The roof arched upwards, ending in a pointed triangle. Before Shinji stepped through the front door, he took all this in. Since it was on a residential street, the front yard wasn't much to speak of, mainly made up of bark.

Asuka 下车后绕到副驾驶一侧，打开车门帮助 Shinji 出来，并领着他走上前门的台阶。这栋房子是西式风格，浅灰色外墙，窗户和门框周围有白色装饰。屋顶向上拱起，末端呈尖三角形。在 Shinji 踏入前门之前，他仔细观察了这一切。由于位于住宅区街道上，前院并不显眼，主要由树皮覆盖。

Asuka brought him into the first room she had entered, sitting him down on the couch in front of the fire place.

明日香带他进了她第一个进入的房间，让他坐在壁炉前的沙发上。

"Wait here for a bit. I"m gonna start bringing in a few things."

在这里稍等片刻。我要开始搬些东西进来了。

"Okay," replied Shinji as he craned his neck back, watching Asuka as she rushed out the front door. She certainly seemed to be in a good mood.

“好的，”真嗣回答道，他扭头向后看去，只见明日香匆匆从前门跑出去。她看起来心情确实不错。

Looking at his surroundings, Shinji took in the fireplace and its surrounding items, his eyes falling on the stack of wood nearby. With that amount, it would probably last them a couple days at the very least. It was something to start with at least.

环顾四周，真嗣注意到壁炉及其周围的物品，目光落在附近的一堆木头上。有这些木头，至少能维持他们几天所需。至少是个不错的开始。

Turning to his left, he looked at the table against the far window that held all the photos. He could just make out the images of a family in one of the larger photos. He was curious about who had lived here before Third Impact, but at the same time, that thought seemed rather rude.

他转向左边，看向远处窗户旁的桌子，上面摆满了照片。他勉强能辨认出一张较大照片上的一家子。他对第三次冲击前住在这里的人感到好奇，但同时，这个想法似乎有些失礼。

Hearing hurrying feet behind him, Shinji turned to look behind, and saw Asuka carrying several things in her outstretched arms. Shinji would have helped, but he knew that if he even tried to stand up without Asuka's assistance, she would certainly yell at him. Instead, Shinji didn't have much choice to watch as Asuka made trip after trip from the car to the inside of the house. She didn't make any attempt to sort out the items, so they were strewn across the floor several feet from the door. They would have time for that later.

听到身后急促的脚步声，真嗣转头望去，只见明日香正伸开双臂抱着几样东西。真嗣本想帮忙，但他知道，若没有明日香的搀扶，自己哪怕尝试站起来，也定会招来她的责骂。于是，真嗣只能无奈地看着明日香一次次从车里往返至屋内。她并未试图整理这些物品，任由它们散落在门口几英尺外的地板上。整理的事，留待以后再说吧。

After several more minutes passed by, Asuka returned with the final trip, shutting the door behind her as she did. Shinji didn't know why, but the moment that Asuka closed the door behind herself, he felt a certain pressure suddenly weighing down on him. Were they going to stay here for the rest of the winter? Living in the outdoors was one thing, but staying in a house with Asuka seemed different, even if there was much more space. Shinji had once suggested this idea before, when they had first come to Tokyo-2, but the reality of what was actually happening was different then what he had imagined.

又过了几分钟，明日香带着最后一趟回来了，进门时顺手关上了门。真嗣不知道为什么，但就在明日香关上身后门的那一刻，他突然感到一种压力重重地压在了自己身上。他们要在这里度过整个冬天吗？在户外生活是一回事，但和明日香待在屋子里似乎不同，尽管空间大得多。真嗣曾在他们刚到东京-2 时提出过这个想法，但现实发生的情况与他当初的想象截然不同。

"Well, I brought almost everything except for the stuff for the tent. I figured I'd leave it there for the time being, though maybe it would have been better to move it into the garage," said Asuka with her head cocked slightly to the side as she puzzled over this.

“嗯，我几乎把所有东西都带来了，除了帐篷的那些装备。我想暂时先放在那儿，不过也许搬到车库里会更好，”明日香说着，头微微歪向一边，陷入了沉思。

"Doesn't make much difference either way," shrugged Shinji.

“反正也没什么差别，”真嗣耸了耸肩。

"No, I don't suppose it doesn't," said Asuka as she stood behind him, pressing her hands down on the edge of the couch.

“不，我想确实没什么差别，”明日香站在他身后说道，双手按在沙发边缘。

Neither of them spoke for several seconds, both realizing the sudden shift in there living situation. Was it truly right for them to be staying here for the time being? Somebody else had lived here until recently, and probably somebody before them. Was it okay for them to be staying here even though they didn't belong?

两人沉默了好几秒，都意识到了居住状况的突然变化。他们暂时住在这里真的合适吗？不久前这里还住着别人，或许之前还有其他人。即使他们不属于这里，住在这里真的可以吗？

"I think I'll get the fire started," said Asuka.

“我想我该把火生起来。”明日香说道。

"Some extra warmth would be welcome," agreed Shinji.

“多些温暖总是好的。”真嗣赞同道。

Shinji felt the pressure from Asuka's hands leave the couch, and noticed her presence disappearing behind him. She had gone into another room, though for what, Shinji wasn't sure.

真嗣感觉到明日香的手从沙发上移开，注意到她的身影在他身后消失。她走进了另一个房间，尽管去做什么，真嗣并不确定。

Asuka returned shortly, with several crumpled up, brightly colored, pieces of paper. 'For extra kindling,' as she put it. Opening the glass door, she place two of the crumpled pieces into the fireplace, and then grabbed two of the dry pieces of wood, and stacked them on top. Taking the lighter out of her jeans pocket, she lit one end of the paper, and watched the flame spread. Closing the glass door, she watched the wood begin to catch, and she sat back, enjoying the warmth from the new fire. Slowly, Shinji began to feel the warmth of the fire caressing his face as well, and slouched back into the cushions. It couldn't be called home, but it was certainly comfortable.

明日香不久便回来了，手里攥着几张皱巴巴、色彩鲜艳的纸片。她称之为“额外的引火物”。她打开玻璃门，将两张皱纸放入壁炉，随后抓起两块干木柴，叠放在上面。从牛仔裤口袋里掏出打火机，点燃纸的一端，看着火焰蔓延开来。关上玻璃门，她注视着木柴开始燃烧，然后坐回原位，享受着新火带来的温暖。渐渐地，真嗣也感受到了火光轻抚脸颊的暖意，便懒洋洋地靠在垫子上。这里虽不能称之为家，但确实舒适宜人。

"Ah...this is relaxing," said Asuka as she laid down on the carpet. She couldn't remember the last time she had been this relaxed.

“啊……这样真放松，”明日香躺在地毯上说道。她记不清上一次这么放松是什么时候了。

After several minutes passed, Shinji began to noticed his eyes drooping slowly. The combination of the fire and the couch was putting him to sleep.

几分钟后，真嗣开始注意到自己的眼皮渐渐沉重。火光和沙发的组合让他昏昏欲睡。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"Mmm...what? I'm resting."

"嗯...什么？我在休息。"

"You did a good job finding this place."

"你找到这个地方做得不错。"

Looking upward at him from where she lay on the carpet, she smirked and said, "Of course. Since I chose this place, its perfect."

她躺在地毯上，抬头望着他，嘴角勾起一抹得意的笑，说道：“当然，既然是我选的地方，自然是完美无缺。”

Swinging her legs upward, she sat up suddenly and turned around to face him. It was the first good look that Shinji had seen of Asuka since she had started looking around at the different houses. Her hair was drenched and her clothes were clearly soaked through. Shinji was surprised that she wasn't shivering. The last thing they needed was for Asuka to get a cold right now.

她猛地坐起身，双腿向上摆动，转过来面对着他。这是自 Asuka 开始四处看房子以来，Shinji 第一次好好地看到她。她的头发湿透了，衣服也明显湿透了。Shinji 惊讶她居然没有发抖。现在最不需要的就是 Asuka 感冒了。

"You should probably change out of those clothes."

“你或许应该换掉那些衣服。”

"What makes you say that?" asked Asuka.

""你为什么这么说？"" 明日香问道。

"Because you getting a cold while I've still got a bad leg is possibly the worse thing that could happen right now."

“因为你在我的腿还没好的时候感冒，可能是现在最糟糕的事情了。”

Shinji truthfully said this, but it still caused Asuka to blush briefly.

真嗣诚实地说了这话，但还是让明日香脸颊微微泛红。

"You have a point I guess," said Asuka as she looked away from him.

“你说得有道理吧，”明日香说着，目光从他身上移开。

Standing up, she went behind the couch and Shinji heard the shuffling of clothes as she went through the pile. Straightening up, Asuka left the room with a single pair of jeans and shirt clutched in her hands. Shinji was almost surprised that Asuka hadn't said something about not peeking at her while she changed.

她站起身，走到沙发后面，真嗣听到衣物窸窣的声音，她正在那堆衣服里翻找。整理好后，明日香拿着一条牛仔裤和一件衬衫离开了房间。真嗣几乎有点惊讶，明日香居然没说什么不许偷看她换衣服的话。

A short while later, Asuka returned to the living room, clad in a new pair of jeans and a plain white t-shirt. Her wet clothes, she placed in a pile beside the fireplace, deciding that it would be best to let them dry off. Shinji watched her do this, and was surprised when she turned towards him, and plopped herself down on the cushion beside him.

片刻之后，明日香回到了客厅，换上了一条新牛仔裤和一件纯白 T 恤。她将湿衣服堆在壁炉旁，决定最好让它们自然晾干。真嗣看着她这么做，当她转向他，一屁股坐在他旁边的垫子上时，他感到有些惊讶。

"Ah, I almost forgot what this felt like," sighed Asuka gently, tilting her head backwards.

“啊，我几乎忘了这种感觉，”明日香轻轻叹息，将头向后仰。

They were warm and comfortable now, while the rain continued coming down outside. They could hear it cascading down on the roof above their heads, and hitting the window near them. Shinji thought they had made the right decision.

此刻他们温暖而舒适，外面的雨依旧下个不停。他们能听到雨水从头顶的屋顶倾泻而下，击打在附近的窗户上。真嗣觉得他们的决定是正确的。

Suddenly, Shinji felt something bump into his shoulder. His eyes darted to their left, and saw the top of somebody's head leaning against him.

突然，真嗣感到有什么东西碰到了他的肩膀。他的目光迅速转向左侧，看到某人的头顶正倚靠在他身上。

"Um...Asuka..." started Shinji slowly.

“呃...明日香...”真嗣缓缓开口。

Waiting several seconds, Asuka didn't reply or give any sign that she heard him. Carefully, Shinji moved himself forward ever so slightly, getting a better look at Asuka's face.

等了几秒，明日香没有回应，也没有任何她听到的迹象。真嗣小心翼翼地向前挪动了一点点，以便更清楚地看到明日香的脸。

'Well, she did work hard,' thought Shinji as he saw her face. Her eyes were closed, and she was breathing softly, clearly fast asleep. Still, having Asuka sleeping against him was causing Shinji's heart to run wild. On the other hand, waking her up or moving was also a problem.

“嗯，她的确很努力。”真嗣看着她的脸想道。她的眼睛闭着，呼吸轻柔，显然已经熟睡。然而，明日香靠在他身上睡觉，让真嗣的心跳得狂乱。另一方面，叫醒她或移动她也是个问题。

'Guess I'll just deal with it then,' thought Shinji as he leaned back into the couch, the warmth of Asuka still pressing against his side.

“看来我只能面对它了。” 真嗣想着，向后靠在沙发上，阿斯娜的温暖依旧紧贴在他身旁。

Shinji dozed in and out of sleep, never quite knowing when he was sleeping, or when he was awake. The warmth of the fireplace was continually threatening to put him into a deep slumber, but he battled against it. Asuka gave no sign that she was waking any time soon, so this was an added worry to Shinji. Whenever she woke up though, Shinji didn't think it would be pleasant.

真嗣在半睡半醒之间徘徊，始终无法确定自己何时入睡，何时醒来。壁炉的温暖不断诱惑着他陷入深深的睡眠，但他与之抗争。明日香没有丝毫即将醒来的迹象，这让真嗣更加担忧。每当她醒来时，真嗣觉得那场面都不会太愉快。

Again, he felt himself dozing off, and tried fighting against it, shaking his head furiously as he did so. It seemed like this had another affect though.

又一次，他感到自己快要睡着了，于是拼命摇头试图抵抗睡意。然而，这似乎产生了另一种效果。

A low groan came from the person leaning against him. Asuka slowly stretched her arms up, nearly knocking her hand into the side of Shinji's head as she did. Yawning widely, she blinking several times, her vision coming into focus. She saw the fireplace in front of her, several feet away from where she sat. Even with the fire though, she felt incredibly warm. Or was it just the one side of her that felt considerably warm. Directing her eyes to her right, she latched onto someones pant leg, and then followed a line upwards towards their face. Blinking several times, Asuka realized that her nose was almost touching Shinji's, their lips mere inches apart.

一声低沉的呻吟从靠在他身上的人那里传来。明日香缓缓伸展双臂，差点用手碰到真嗣的头侧。她打了个大大的哈欠，眨了几次眼，视线逐渐清晰。她看到面前的壁炉，距离她坐的地方有几英尺远。尽管有火光，她却感到异常温暖。或者只是她的一侧感觉特别热。她将目光转向右侧，注意到某人的裤腿，然后顺着向上看向他们的脸。眨了几次眼后，明日香意识到自己的鼻子几乎贴着真嗣的，两人的嘴唇相距仅几英寸。

"WAAAAAHHHHH!" "哇啊啊啊啊！"

Asuka threw herself backwards against the farthest edge of the couch away from Shinji, which truthfully wasn't very far, and Asuka ended up falling off the couch in the process.

明日香猛地向后仰去，靠在了离真嗣最远的沙发边缘，实际上距离并不远，结果她就这样从沙发上摔了下来。

"W-W-Why was I was sleeping next to you!?"

“我、我、我怎么会睡在你旁边！？”

"You're the one that fell asleep, so don't blame me!" retorted Shinji.

“是你自己睡着的，别怪我！”真嗣反驳道。

"You could have moved instead of staying there!"

"你本可以移动的，而不是呆在那里！"

"Oh, yeah, just let me limp away from you then. Besides, if I had moved and woke you anyway, you would have been just as angry!"

"哦，是啊，那就让我一瘸一拐地离开你吧。再说了，如果我动了还是把你吵醒了，你一样会生气！"

"I'm angry now damn it!" said Asuka as she stomped her foot; her face was incredibly red. Shinji suspected that his was red as well, and not simply because of the warmth from the fire.

"我现在就很生气，该死！" 明日香跺着脚说；她的脸红得不可思议。真嗣怀疑自己的脸也红了，不仅仅是因为火堆的温暖。

"Oh, forget it," groaned Asuka as she stormed off into the other room, her feet echoing off the walls.

“哦，算了吧，”明日香咕哝着，气冲冲地走进另一个房间，脚步声在墙面上回响。

Shinji didn't bother watching her leave; he was annoyed with the situation as well, for a multitude of reasons.

真嗣没有费心看她离开；他也对这种情况感到恼火，原因有很多。

"...Hey." "...嘿。"

Shinji turned at the sound of Asuka's voice, and saw her standing in the opening to the other room.

真嗣听到明日香的声音转过身来，看到她站在另一个房间的门口。

"You hungry?" "你饿了吗？"

"...Sorta," was Shinji's quiet reply.

"...算是吧，" 真嗣轻声回答道。

"...All make something then."

"...那就一起做点什么吧。"

Shinji didn't hear from her for twenty minutes after that. When Asuka finally did reappear in the open doorway, she was carrying two bowls of soup. Considering that Shinji hadn't heard anything from her for sometime, Shinji didn't have a clue as to how she had accomplished this. Seeing his expression however, Asuka just sighed and passed him one of the bowls, explaining what she had done.

之后二十分钟里，真嗣都没听到她的动静。当明日香终于再次出现在敞开的门口时，她手里端着两碗汤。考虑到真嗣有一阵子没听到她的声音了，他完全不知道她是怎么做到的。然而，看到他的表情，明日香只是叹了口气，递给他一碗汤，解释了她所做的事情。

"The people that lived here had some canned food already, and I made something with that. If you're asking how I cooked it, then they've got a grill in their backyard."

"住在这里的人已经有一些罐头食品了，我用那些做了点东西。如果你问我是怎么烹饪的，那是因为他们后院有个烤架。"

"And the bowl and spoons?"

"那碗和勺子呢？"

"Both this houses former residences," replied Asuka. "The canned food should last a week at the most, and plus we brought enough food to last another week as well."

"都是这房子以前的住户留下的，" 明日香回答道。"这些罐头食品最多能撑一个星期，而且我们还带了足够再吃一个星期的食物。"

"What are you thinking?" "你在想什么？"

"Just a precaution I guess," shrugged Asuka.

"只是以防万一吧，" 明日香耸了耸肩。

Their former argument nearly forgotten, Shinji sat on the couch and ate, while Asuka leaned against a nearby wall and did likewise. After they finished, Asuka took the bowls and deposited them in the sink. It felt strange placing dishes in an object which hadn't held any meaning to them in a while. With that done, Asuka helped Shinji around the rest of the house, showing him the different rooms. One thing that was helpful about living in a house now, was that Shinji could move around to a certain extent, as long as he used his hand to brace himself against objects. He did have difficulty making it up the two flights of stairs, but as long as he paced himself, and made sure to clutch the railing, he didn't have any problems.

他们之前的争执几乎被遗忘，真嗣坐在沙发上吃饭，而明日香则靠在附近的墙上，同样在吃。吃完后，明日香拿起碗碟，放入水槽。将餐具放进一个对他们来说已经很久没有意义的东西里，感觉很奇怪。做完这些，明日香带着真嗣在房子里转了一圈，向他展示不同的房间。现在住在房子里的一个好处是，真嗣可以在一定程度上自由移动，只要他用一只手扶着物体支撑自己。他上两段楼梯确实有困难，但只要他控制好节奏，并确保紧握扶手，就不会有问题。

The last room that Asuka showed him was the master bedroom, and Shinji decided to rest for a minute, sitting on the edge of the bed.

明日香带他看的最后一个房间是主卧室，真嗣决定坐下来休息一会儿，坐在床边。

"So there are three different bedrooms in this house."

“所以这房子里有三个不同的卧室。”

"Two," mumbled Asuka quietly.

“两个，”明日香轻声咕哝道。

Glancing over at her, Shinji supposed that she did have a point. Something about occupying a child's bedroom just felt inherently wrong.

瞥了她一眼，真嗣觉得她说的确实有道理。占用一个孩子的卧室，总感觉哪里不对劲。

"Two then...one for each of us."

"那就两个吧...我们一人一个。"

"Finally we wont be sleeping in the same place anymore. I'm tired of waking up and seeing you next to me."

"终于我们不用再睡在同一个地方了。我厌倦了醒来时看到你在我旁边。"

Shinji didn't think it was as bad as Asuka was making it out to be, but he didn't say anything.

真嗣并不认为情况有阿斯卡所说的那么糟糕，但他什么也没说。

"Who gets what though?" "那谁拿什么东西呢？"

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Who gets what room?" "谁住哪个房间？"

"Isn't that obvious? I'm calling this room since I have more stuff than you," said Asuka, slightly smirking. Shinji couldn't help but sigh, realizing that he should have seen this coming.

"这不是很明显吗？我东西比你多，这个房间我定了。" 明日香略带得意地说道。真嗣不禁叹了口气，意识到自己早该料到这一幕。

"Alright, the guest bedrooms is mine then I guess." Either way, it didn't really matter to Shinji. Just having a bed to sleep in for once was enough for him. He didn't see Asuka frown however; she was wishing that he would have put up more of a fight.

"好吧，那客卧归我了，我想。" 对真嗣来说，其实无所谓。只要有个地方能睡觉就够了。然而他没注意到明日香皱了皱眉；她心里倒是希望他能多争一争。

Shinji returned downstairs and sat on the couch, enjoying the warmth of the fire while Asuka began moving everything she had accumulated up to her new bedroom. She sorted everything out that was already in the dresser. Most of it was clearly several sizes too large for her growing body, but she thought, 'maybe one day,' and ended up storing these in the second dresser. Everything that she didn't want she threw into a corner. Maybe they could use all these extra clothes as kindling.

真嗣回到楼下，坐在沙发上，享受着炉火的温暖，而明日香则开始将她积攒的所有东西搬到她的新卧室。她整理了已经在抽屉里的所有物品。其中大部分显然对她日渐成长的身躯来说尺寸过大，但她想，'也许有一天'，最终把这些衣物存放在第二个抽屉里。她不想要的东西都被扔到了一个角落。也许他们可以把这些多余的衣物当作引火物。

As she thought that, Asuka suddenly felt remorseful. Somebody had once lived here, and now she was going through the things of that person, picking and choosing what she liked, and burning the rest. Under normal circumstances, this would be considered criminal, or guarantee admission to an asylum. At some point though, she had to get passed that notion of somebody else's things. It was only herself and Shinji in this entire city, and maybe the world; there was nothing former about things they found. In order to survive, they had to act like scavengers.

想到这里，明日香突然感到一阵悔意。曾经有人住在这里，而现在她正在翻找那个人的东西，挑选她喜欢的，剩下的则烧掉。在正常情况下，这会被视为犯罪，或者保证被送进精神病院。但不知何时，她不得不抛开对别人东西的这种观念。整个城市，甚至可能是整个世界，只有她和真嗣两个人；他们找到的东西没有什么是以前的。为了生存，他们不得不像拾荒者一样行事。

While dampening her mood briefly, Asuka began sorting through the clothes again. She even set aside a separate pile that was clearly mens clothes. Maybe one day, Shinji would wear some of these. Asuka decided not to think about that though; let him decide if he wanted them or not.

尽管心情短暂地低落了一下，Asuka 又开始重新整理衣物。她甚至特意分出一堆明显是男装的衣物。也许有一天，Shinji 会穿上其中的一些。但 Asuka 决定不去多想这些；让他自己决定是否需要它们吧。

After she was done sorting everything out, she went back downstairs to check on Shinji. 'Well, no, not check up on,' she corrected her thinking. Then again, she didn't know why she was doing this.

整理完毕后，她回到楼下查看 Shinji 的情况。'好吧，并不是特意去查看，'她在心里纠正自己。不过，她也不清楚自己为何要这么做。

Shinji was sitting on the couch, his legs stretched outwards, and his body sinking into the cushions.

Shinji 正坐在沙发上，双腿伸展开来，身体陷进靠垫里。

"You seem relaxed," said Asuka as she entered the living room.

"你看起来很放松，" 明日香走进客厅时说道。

"Well, I can't remember the last time I was this warm," said Shinji. He was staring into the fire, his expression mixed.

"嗯，我都不记得上次这么暖和是什么时候了，" 真嗣说道。他凝视着火光，表情复杂。

"Something wrong?" asked Asuka, noticing this.

"有什么不对劲吗？" 明日香注意到这一点，问道。

"No, nothing," said Shinji, not quite meeting her eyes.

“不，没什么。” 真嗣说道，眼神略显躲闪。

Asuka peered at his face, but shrugged in the end. If it wasn't something he wanted to talk about, she wouldn't bother him with it.

明日香仔细端详着他的脸，但最终还是耸了耸肩。如果这不是他想谈论的话题，她就不会用它来打扰他。

"I sorted out all the clothes from the master bedroom. There was some mens clothes mixed in, so if you wanted to look through it, I made a pile."

“我把主卧室的所有衣服都整理好了。里面混杂了一些男装，如果你想查看的话，我已经堆成了一堆。”

"Thanks, I'll look through it tomorrow."

谢谢，我明天会仔细看的。

"Hmm, okay," nodded Asuka as she turned and left the room. Pausing in the doorway, Asuka turned and looked at the back of Shinji's head. Something was clearly troubling him, and Asuka could only guess what it was. Unfortunately, she didn't see how she could help him.

“嗯，好吧，”明日香点点头，转身离开了房间。在门口停下，明日香回头看向真嗣的后脑勺。显然有什么事情困扰着他，而明日香只能猜测那是什么。遗憾的是，她想不出自己能如何帮助他。

Leaving the living room, Asuka walked upstairs and entered her bedroom.

离开客厅，明日香走上楼，进入了她的卧室。

'My bedroom, never thought I'd think something like that,' wondered Asuka.

‘我的卧室，从没想过我会这么想，’明日香心想。

Night had descended by now, and without a light source, Asuka buried herself in the covers and laid down on the comfy pillow. Ah, such bliss; it was an incredible feeling, something which she hoped she'd never forget. The bed was meant for two people, but Asuka couldn't help but shift from one side to the next, enjoying the extra space. Nobody to bump into her in the middle of the night, nobody to wake up beside her, nobody to annoy her.

夜幕已然降临，没有光源，明日香将自己埋进被子里，躺在了舒适的枕头上。啊，如此幸福；这是一种难以置信的感觉，她希望自己永远不会忘记。这张床本是为两人准备的，但明日香忍不住从一边挪到另一边，享受着额外的空间。夜里没有人会撞到她，没有人会在她身边醒来，也没有人会惹她烦。

'This is wonderful,' thought Asuka.

“这真是太棒了，”明日香心想。

It was a short time later as she continued laying there, that she heard the steady sound of footsteps as Shinji slowly made his way up the stairs. Her door was cracked open slightly, and so Shinji didn't even have to open it as he spoke to her.

不久之后，她依旧躺在那里，听到了稳重的脚步声，那是真嗣缓缓走上楼梯的声音。她的房门微微开着，所以真嗣无需推门便能与她交谈。

"You still awake?" “你还没睡吗？”

"Hmm, yeah. I'm just enjoying this feeling right now."

“嗯，是的。我只是在享受此刻的感觉。”

"Well I'm going to bed."

"好吧，我要去睡觉了。"

"Did you put the fire out?"

"你把火灭了吗？"

"No, I think we can leave it on without worrying. It'll die out eventually anyway."

"没有，我觉得我们可以不用操心，它自己会慢慢熄灭的。"

"Do you need any help getting in bed?"

"你需要帮忙上床吗？"

"No, I can manage," replied Shinji. "Night Asuka."

"不用，我自己能行。晚安，明日香。"

"Ah, night Shinji." "啊，晚安，真嗣。"

Shinji left, closing the door as he did so. Asuka heard his footsteps disappearing along the hallway until they vanished, obviously entered the guest bedroom. Or was it right to call it his bedroom now? Asuka puzzled over this for several seconds before she shrugged, and curled herself in a ball, nestled into the many blankets, prepared to fall asleep.

真嗣离开了，顺手带上了门。明日香听到他的脚步声沿着走廊渐行渐远，直至消失，显然是进了客房卧室。但现在称它为他的卧室是否恰当呢？明日香对此困惑了几秒，随后耸耸肩，蜷缩成一团，埋进厚厚的被褥中，准备入睡。

'You've got to be kidding me!'

“你一定是在开玩笑吧！”

Asuka thought this as she sat upright, her hair spilling down her shoulders, removing herself from the tangle of blankets. How many hours had it been? Two? Three? Four? Asuka didn't know, but she had been tossing and turning the passed few hours, and hadn't gotten a single ounce of sleep. She was pissed at this.

明日香一边想，一边坐直身子，头发披散在肩上，从乱糟糟的被子里挣脱出来。已经过去多少小时了？两小时？三小时？四小时？明日香不清楚，但她已经辗转反侧了好几个小时，一点儿觉也没睡成。这让她很恼火。

'Why am I unable to sleep?'

“为什么我睡不着呢？”

She was angry at herself, even though sleep should have come in an instant. In the two months that had happened since she had woken up in Tokyo-3, not once had she been this warm and comfortable. And yet, why was she still unable to fall asleep? It didn't make any sense!

她对自己感到愤怒，尽管睡眠本应瞬间降临。自从两个月前在东京-3 醒来以来，她从未如此温暖舒适过。然而，为什么她仍然无法入睡？这毫无道理！

Throwing herself back down on the pillows, she rolling around several times, trying to find a comfortable position. No matter what she tried though, she wasn't able sleep. Was it because she wasn't used to sleeping on a bed anymore? Or was it because she knew that this wasn't her bed? Either way, it didn't matter. Sleep was not possible right now.

她猛地倒回枕头上，翻来覆去几次，试图找到一个舒适的姿势。尽管她尝试了各种方法，却始终无法入睡。是因为她不再习惯睡在床上吗？还是因为她知道这不是她的床？无论原因是什么，都不重要。现在无法入睡。

'Maybe, I'm just not tired enough,' thought Asuka. That didn't make any sense either, as she had been running around in the rain all morning. And speaking of the rain, she could still hear it coming down outside. If it hadn't started raining, she would still be sleeping in a tent in that park, and probably fast asleep by now. For the first time since entering this house, Asuka missed living in that tent.

'也许，我只是还不够累，'明日香想。这同样说不通，因为她整个上午都在雨中奔波。说到雨，她仍能听到外面的雨声。如果雨没有开始下，她现在还会睡在那个公园的帐篷里，可能早已熟睡。自从进入这所房子以来，明日香第一次怀念住在那个帐篷里的日子。

Or was it just the tent itself? The park had been very peaceful as well, and Asuka had gotten used to living like that. Waking up everyday to the sound of birds and blue sky over her head, making a campfire and cooking over it, the rough ground grinding into her back as she slept. How was it that those things could be so nostalgic? But, that wasn't it at all, as Asuka realized something. For the first time since bonding together, Asuka and Shinji weren't sleeping within sight of each other. Whether it was sleeping on the beaches of Tokyo-3, sleeping in the Geofront, the car, or the tent, they had always been within a distance where they could see each other.

抑或仅仅是帐篷本身的缘故？公园同样宁静祥和，明日香已习惯了这样的生活。每天醒来，耳畔是鸟鸣，头顶是蓝天，燃起篝火，在火上烹饪，粗糙的地面硌着她的背入眠。为何这些事会如此令人怀念？然而，明日香意识到，并非如此。自结合以来，这是第一次，明日香和真嗣没有在彼此视线内入睡。无论是在第三新东京市的沙滩上，还是在地底都市的床上，车里，或是帐篷中，他们始终保持着能看见对方的距离。

Asuka sat up slowly, the blankets sliding off her. She had never realized before, just how large and lonely the room she was attempting to sleep in was. She shivered, and it was clearly not for lack of being warm. The fact was, that being separated from Shinji like this was making her uneasy. She had always known that he was nearby no matter, and even though he was just a door down from where she lay, he still wasn't here.

明日香缓缓坐起身，毯子从她身上滑落。她从未意识到，自己试图入睡的这个房间竟如此空旷而孤寂。她打了个寒颤，显然并非因为不够温暖。事实上，与真嗣这样分开让她感到不安。她一直知道无论何时他都在附近，尽管他只隔着一扇门，但此刻他仍不在身边。

Turning her body, she swung her legs over the side of the bed, and stood up. Though it was dark, her eyes had had plenty of time to acclimate to the darkness, and she easily found her door. Opening it, she slowly walked out into the dark hallway. Running her hands along the wall, she found the door to the guest bedroom, Shinji's room. Turning the knob, she tiptoed into the room.

她转过身，将双腿移到床边，站了起来。尽管四周一片漆黑，但她的眼睛早已适应了黑暗，轻松找到了房门。打开门，她缓缓步入昏暗的走廊。双手沿着墙壁摸索，她找到了客卧的门，也就是真嗣的房间。转动门把手，她踮着脚尖悄悄走了进去。

"Couldn't sleep either huh?"

"也睡不着吗？"

Asuka jumped immensely at Shinji's words. Whipping her head around, she could barely make out his outline that was sitting upright.

听到真嗣的话，明日香吓了一大跳。她猛地转过头，勉强能辨认出他笔直坐着的轮廓。

"What are you doing," she hissed back at him.

"你在干什么，"她低声回敬他。

"Trying to fall asleep, just as I assume you were trying to do."

"试图入睡，正如我猜你也在尝试的那样。"

"I-" Asuka started, but she didn't know what she could say. Shinji wasn't able to sleep either right? So didn't that basically mean...

"我——" 明日香开口了，但她不知道该说什么。真嗣也没能睡着，对吧？所以这基本上意味着...

Wordlessly Asuka walked further into the room, stepping around the edge of the bed, and walked to the side of the bed where Shinji was sitting. It was difficult to discern Shinji's features, and so Asuka didn't know what expression he was making when she spoke.

明日香默默地走进房间，绕过床边，走到真嗣坐的那一侧。真嗣的面部特征难以辨认，因此明日香不知道他说话时是什么表情。

"Move over." "让开。"

Thinking that he might have misheard, Shinji began to open his mouth and hurriedly closed it. Before he was given time to think, Asuka had started climbing into the bed. Pushing Shinji out of her way, Asuka crawled onto the bed, and threw the covers over herself, laying her head down on the pillow that Shinji had until recently, been laying on. With her back turned away from him, Asuka tried ignoring what she had just done.

以为自己听错了，真嗣刚要张嘴又急忙闭上。还没等他细想，明日香已经开始爬上床。她把真嗣推到一边，爬上床，拉过被子盖在身上，头枕在真嗣刚躺过的枕头上。背对着他，明日香试图忽视自己刚才的举动。

"Asuka...what..." "明日香...什么..."

Shinji didn't seem as ready to come to terms with what had just happened though. Still sitting up, he stared at the back of the girl who had just forced her way into bed with him. What was wrong with Asuka?

但真嗣似乎还没准备好接受刚刚发生的事情。他依旧坐着，盯着那个强行钻进他床铺的女孩的背影。明日香怎么了？

"...Um...Asu-" "...呃...明-"

"What?" asked Asuka as she rolled around to face him. Shinji felt like his nerves were splitting at how close they were to each other. Sleeping next to each while still inside their own sleeping bags was one thing; this was entirely different.

"什么？" 明日香转过身来面对他问道。真嗣感觉自己的神经都要绷断了，因为他们靠得太近了。各自睡在自己的睡袋里是一回事；现在这种情况完全不同。

"Asuka, sleeping like this is a little-"

"明日香，这样睡有点——"

"I thought you said you couldn't sleep either?"

"你不是说你也睡不着吗？"

"I did, but-" "我是说过，但是——"

"This is more comfortable, so shut up and let me sleep already."

"这样更舒服，所以闭嘴让我睡吧。"

Shinji groaned audibly, as he watched her turn away from him again. This situation was, way too impossible. Just because he wasn't able to fall asleep didn't necessarily mean...well, though he had been thinking, but...

真嗣明显地叹了口气，看着她再次背对他。这种情况，实在是太过分了。仅仅因为他无法入睡并不一定意味着……好吧，虽然他一直在思考，但是……

Shinji battled with himself for a long time before he finally laid back onto the mattress, trying to ignore the presence of somebody unbearably close to him.

真嗣与自己斗争了很久，最终才躺回床垫上，试图忽视身边那个令人难以忍受的近距离存在。

"...Shinji?" "...真嗣？"

"...Yeah?" "...嗯？"

They didn't turn towards each other, but continued facing opposite directions.

他们没有转向彼此，而是继续面对相反的方向。

"Sorry...can you put up with me for just this one night?"

"对不起...今晚你能忍受我一下吗？"

Though incredibly awkward for himself, and herself as well, he still ended up nodding.

尽管对他自己，以及她来说都极为尴尬，他最终还是点了点头。

"Its fine. I wasn't able to sleep either so..."

没事的。我也睡不着，所以...

What was he saying? 他在说什么呢？

"Hmm...thank you..." “嗯……谢谢你……”

Asuka fell asleep shortly after this, wrapped warmly in the blankets that were shared between herself and Shinji. Shinji found it much more difficult, but eventually resigned himself to the situation. It wasn't uncomfortable, more like the opposite if anything, but the embarrassment was beyond what he could readily take. True, they had grown accustomed to sleeping at least somewhat close, but this was a different level entirely. Sharing the same bed, Shinji didn't think he had ever considered such a thing. Their relationship was...well, Shinji was unsure at this point.

不久后，明日香就在这些她和真嗣共用的毯子里温暖地睡着了。真嗣发现这比他想象的要困难得多，但最终还是接受了现状。这并不难受，反倒可以说是舒适，但尴尬的程度超出了他能轻易承受的范围。确实，他们已经习惯了至少在某种程度上靠近入睡，但这次完全是另一个层次。共用一张床，真嗣从未想过这样的事情。他们的关系……嗯，真嗣现在也不确定了。

Blocking out such thoughts was hard, but Shinji was finally able to fall asleep. Albeit, he rather dreaded the morning.

将这些思绪抛诸脑后很难，但真嗣最终还是能够入睡。尽管如此，他对早晨的到来颇为畏惧。

Right, so, after the last few chapters where I've obviously been building up a few things, I just really wanted to have a chapter that was simply all about Shinji and Asuka. Not to mention that writing from Asuka's perspective is always a lot of fun. On the flip side, this chapter is pretty much the opposite of what chapter 12 was like in Spawn of Adam, and that was a difficult one to write, if you remember what it contained.

没错，在过去的几章里，我显然一直在铺垫一些事情，我只是真的很想写一个纯粹关于真嗣和明日香的故事。更不用说从明日香的角度来写总是非常有趣。另一方面，这个章节与《亚当的孽种》中的第 12 章截然相反，那章写起来相当困难，如果你还记得它包含的内容的话。

As a side note, there is going to be a brief time skip at the start of the next chapter. So just a heads up.

顺便一提，下一章开头会有一个短暂的时间跳跃。所以提前给大家打个招呼。

### Chapter 13: Prelude

Another chapter here, but I'll talk more about things to come at the end of this.

这里是另一个 chapter，不过我会在结尾处多谈谈即将到来的事情。

---

It had been two weeks since Shinji and Asuka had vacated to their new home. Or was it proper to call it their new home? Either way, two weeks had passed since they had started living there. The rain continued pouring down from the heavens at an unbelievable pace, only letting up on occasion. Two days after they had begun living there, Shinji's leg had fully healed, much to the relief of Asuka. Other than that, nothing eventful had happened, not since their first night together at least.

真嗣和明日香搬到新家已经两周了。或者应该说那是他们的新家吗？无论如何，他们开始在那里生活已经过去了两周。雨水以令人难以置信的速度从天而降，只是偶尔停歇。在他们开始居住的两天后，真嗣的腿完全康复了，这让明日香松了一口气。除此之外，没有什么特别的事情发生，至少从他们第一晚在一起之后就没有了。

True to her word, Asuka had only spent that first night together with Shinji, and afterwards, had slept peacefully in her own bedroom. She didn't mention what she had done, and neither did Shinji bring it up. It was something that had happened between them, that was an unspoken occurrence. Even when Shinji had awoken that next morning, Asuka had already left the bed, and he found her dozing lightly on the couch downstairs.

正如她所承诺的，明日香只与真嗣共度了那一夜，之后便安然睡回了自己的卧室。她没有提及所做的事情，真嗣也未曾提起。那是他们之间发生的一件不言而喻的事。即使第二天早上真嗣醒来时，明日香已经离开了床铺，他发现她正轻轻地躺在楼下的沙发上打盹。

Since they had started living there, they had only left the house a handful of times. Once to get more canned goods, a second time when Asuka had gotten bored and restless, and a third when their pile of dry wood had slowly started to dwindle. Without fire, it would be meaningless to stay there.

自从他们开始住在那里，只离开过房子几次。一次是为了多买些罐头食品，第二次是明日香感到无聊和不安，第三次则是当他们的干木材逐渐减少时。没有火，留在那里就没有意义了。

Even so, boredom came all too easy for both of them. Within a single room of the house, was a study, likely used by the male of the house, and along a certain wall, was a bookcase filled with books. Shinji and Asuka had taken their time pouring through these, reading anything that caught their interest, but this still wasn't enough.

即便如此，无聊对他们两人来说还是太容易了。房子里有一个书房，很可能是男主人用的，沿着某面墙有一个摆满书的书架。真嗣和明日香花了很多时间浏览这些书，阅读任何引起他们兴趣的内容，但这仍然不够。

Ever since it had started raining, Asuka had come up with a way to bathe properly. In the garage, she had found two large buckets, neither of which she could guess their true purpose. She placed them out back, behind the house, and let them fill with water. One bucket of water was used for cleaning your body, and the other was used for rinsing off the shampoo and soap. It was a very rudimentary way of bathing, and you were short of freezing at the end, but it did work. The first time Asuka had done this, Shinji didn't know, and only discovered after she had come in the backdoor draped in a towel. He had hurriedly been banished to the second floor, while Asuka dried off in front of the fireplace.

自从开始下雨，明日香就想出了一个洗澡的办法。她在车库里找到了两个大桶，猜不出它们的真正用途。她把它们放在屋后，让它们装满水。一个桶里的水用来清洗身体，另一个则用来冲洗洗发水和肥皂。这是一种非常原始的洗澡方式，洗完后几乎冻僵，但确实有效。明日香第一次这么做时，真嗣并不知情，直到她裹着毛巾从后门进来才被发现。他慌忙被赶到了二楼，而明日香则在壁炉前擦干身体。

Still, these two weeks weren't unproductive. Shinji didn't know when it had happened, but the distance between himself and Asuka had shrunk. Certainly, being the only two people in existence would do that in time, but it wasn't unusual anymore for them to sit next to each on the couch. In fact, it felt entirely normal. Whether they were eating, reading, talking, or just plain sitting there in silence, very rarely were they out of each others reach. The only time this didn't apply, was when they were both sleeping in separate rooms.

尽管如此，这两周并非毫无成果。真嗣不清楚这一切是何时发生的，但他与明日香之间的距离确实缩短了。当然，作为仅存的两个人，随着时间的推移，这种亲近在所难免，但如今他们并肩坐在沙发上已不再稀奇。实际上，这感觉完全自然。无论是用餐、阅读、交谈，还是单纯地静坐无言，他们几乎总是彼此触手可及。唯一的例外，便是各自回房入睡的时刻。

Then there was Shinji himself. Ever since he broke his leg, he could feel a certain tension building within him, completing unrelated to his and Asuka's growing relationship. He was different, and he couldn't explain why. It almost felt like, there was somebody separate from himself, inhabiting his body within him: another self. Truthfully, Shinji had been worried that once his leg fully healed, something about him would change drastically. Nothing had happened of course, but Shinji was still worried that something could happen. If that did happen, how would he react? He still didn't know how severe the difference would be, but if if threatened Asuka in someway, well, he tried not to think about that.

接着是真嗣自己。自从他摔断腿后，他感到一种紧张感在内心逐渐累积，与他和明日香日益加深的关系完全无关。他变得不同了，却无法解释原因。那种感觉几乎像是，有另一个独立的自我，寄居在他的身体里：另一个自我。说实话，真嗣一直担心一旦他的腿完全康复，自己会有什么剧变。当然，什么都没发生，但真嗣仍担心可能会有事发生。如果真的发生了，他会如何应对？他仍不清楚这种变化会有多严重，但如果它以某种方式威胁到明日香，好吧，他尽量不去想这些。

Besides that, Shinji thoroughly enjoyed these two weeks, living inside this house with Asuka, and hoped that things would continue like this.

除此之外，真嗣非常享受这两周与明日香在这栋房子里的生活，并希望这样的日子能继续下去。

With the fire roaring in front of them, Shinji and Asuka lay in the living room, reading both their books respectively. Asuka was laying on the couch, with a pillow under her head, while Shinji was leaning against the side of the couch, directly beside Asuka, his legs stretched out. Turning a page idly, Shinji suddenly felt the couch shift as Asuka moved, and then felt a pressure on top of his head.

壁炉前的火焰熊熊燃烧，真嗣和明日香各自躺在客厅里阅读自己的书。明日香躺在沙发上，头下垫着一个枕头，而真嗣则靠在沙发边上，双腿伸直，就在明日香旁边。真嗣随意地翻了一页，突然感觉到沙发随着明日香的动作而移动，接着感觉到头顶上有压力。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji. He wasn't annoyed by what she was doing, but it did interrupt his thoughts.

“你在做什么？”真嗣问道。他对她的行为并不感到恼火，但这确实打断了他思考。

"Bored," replied Asuka with a sigh. She was resting her elbow atop Shinji's head, and pressing her cheek against the palm of her hand.

"无聊，" 明日香叹了口气回答道。她将手肘支在真嗣的头上，手掌贴着脸颊。

"How many times have you said that today alone?" wondered Shinji.

"光是今天你就说了多少次了？" 真嗣好奇地问。

"But I can't help it! There's absolutely nothing to do around here except read, and even that gets dull after a while."

"但我也没办法啊！这里除了看书什么都没有，就连看书久了也会觉得无聊。"

"Not like going outside is much of an option though," shrugged Shinji. As he said this, he glanced towards the window on the far left side of the room. It was already passed seven p.m. and clearly dark out, but the distinct sound of rain could be heard coming down outside still.

"出去也没什么好选的，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。说着，他瞥向房间最左侧的窗户。已经是晚上七点多了，外面明显黑漆漆的，但仍能清晰听到雨声从外面传来。

"Even when it's day, the sun is almost never out as it is," finished Shinji.

"即使白天，太阳也几乎不出来，" 真嗣补充道。

"I know that," grumbled Asuka, "but being cooped up here is seriously wearing me down. If I had known that we'd be stuck here for days at a time, I may not have been so quick to move in."

"我知道，" 明日香咕哝着，"但一直困在这里真的让我快崩溃了。如果早知道我们会一次被困好几天，我可能就不会那么快搬进来了。

"Still, your quick decision saved us a lot of time and worry," Shinji reminded her. "If we hadn't found this place, I may still not be walking, and you might have gotten sick."

“不过，你的迅速决定确实为我们省去了不少时间和担忧，”真嗣提醒她，“如果我们没找到这个地方，我可能还无法行走，而你也许已经生病了。”

"I seriously doubt your leg would have slowed down for anything."

"我严重怀疑你的腿会因为任何事而减速。"

Sitting upright, Asuka swung her legs around and leaned back into the couch cushions.

坐直身子，明日香双腿一摆，向后靠在沙发垫上。

"I just wish this rain would slow down for a bit; I'm getting miserable because of it."

"我只希望这场雨能稍微缓一缓；它让我感到非常难受。"

"Hmm, I can understand that logic," said Shinji as he closed his book. Sitting up, he glanced over at Asuka and asked, "I'm gonna make tea. Want some?"

“嗯，我能理解那个逻辑，”真嗣说着合上了书。他坐起身，瞥了一眼明日香，问道：“我要去泡茶。要来点吗？”

"...Why not," shrugged Asuka. It wasn't like she had anything better to do.

“……为什么不呢，”明日香耸了耸肩。反正她也没什么更好的事情可做。

While Shinji went into the kitchen and prepared to boil water on the grill they had outside, Asuka curled herself up into a ball in front of the fireplace. Since coming here, she had done this many times when she had something on her mind, and she'd be lying if she said the majority of the time it wasn't related to Shinji in someway. Right now, she was thinking about something else though.

当真嗣走进厨房，准备在外面的烤架上烧水时，明日香蜷缩在壁炉前。自从来到这里，每当她有心事时，她都会这样做，如果说大多数时候与真嗣无关，那她就是在撒谎。不过现在，她在思考其他事情。

Without a doubt, it was clear that they were entering the winter months, and with winter came Christmas as well. Was it right for her to be thinking about that right now though? Was Christmas even considered a big deal anymore? In this post Third Impact world, what mattered and what didn't? Was it right to celebrate things from their past lives? Asuka couldn't see how Shinji would have a problem with it if she brought it up, but was there a need to celebrate it at all? Something about not celebrating it felt wrong, but maybe that was just wishful thinking on Asuka's part. She had always rather enjoyed Christmas, something which she felt embarrassed about at times.

毫无疑问，他们正步入冬季，而随着冬季的到来，圣诞节也随之而至。但她现在考虑这些合适吗？圣诞节在这个后第三次冲击的世界里还重要吗？什么才是重要的，什么又不再重要？庆祝过去生活中的节日是否正确？如果她提起，真嗣似乎不会有什么问题，但真的有必要庆祝吗？不庆祝的感觉似乎不对，也许这只是她的一厢情愿。她一直挺喜欢圣诞节，有时甚至为此感到尴尬。

Moments later, Shinji came back with two steaming mugs of tea, handing one to Asuka. It was amazing that they hadn't spilt anything in the living room yet, considering they ate almost exclusively in here instead of the dining room, but they were careful. In such a short time, they had become so used to this house that it almost felt like they had always lived here, and before then, had simply been on vacation.

片刻后，真嗣拿着两杯冒着热气的茶回来了，递给明日香一杯。令人惊讶的是，他们至今还没在客厅洒过东西，尽管他们几乎只在这里吃饭而不是在餐厅，但他们很小心。短短时间内，他们已经习惯了这所房子，仿佛一直住在这里，之前只是度假而已。

Sitting down beside Asuka, Shinji fell into the couch cushions, enjoying the comforting feel against his back.

真嗣坐在明日香旁边，陷进沙发垫里，享受着背部传来的舒适感。

"You seem laid back," commented Asuka.

"你看起来很放松，" 明日香评论道。

"I'm glad to be back inside," said Shinji as he sipped from his cup. "It's freezing out there."

"很高兴能回到室内，" 真嗣喝了一口杯子里的东西说道，"外面冷得要命。"

"I'd imagine." "我猜也是。"

"I wouldn't be surprised if it snows soon."

"如果很快下雪了，我也不会感到惊讶。"

Asuka paused for several seconds before she replied, "Yeah, maybe."

明日香停顿了几秒钟才回答，"嗯，也许吧。"

Turning towards her, Shinji asked, "Something wrong?"

转向她，真嗣问道：“有什么不对劲吗？”

"Why would something be wrong?"

“为什么会有什么不对劲呢？”

"I thought your reaction would be, I don't know, more excited maybe."

“我以为你的反应会是，我不知道，也许更兴奋一些。”

"What? Excited that it's so damn cold out there that it starts snowing?"

"什么？因为外面冷得要命开始下雪了而兴奋？"

"Asuka, I was only-" "明日香，我只是——"

"Don't apologize Shinji," sighed Asuka. "Sorry, but cold and rain is not something I want to think of right now. But...no, never mind."

"别道歉了，真嗣。""明日香叹了口气，""对不起，我现在不想考虑寒冷和雨水的事。不过……算了，没什么。"

"What?" asked Shinji. "什么？" 真嗣问道。

"No, forget it. It was a stupid thought."

"不，算了。那是个愚蠢的想法。"

Shinji raised an eyebrow, but didn't pursue the subject.

真嗣挑了挑眉，但没有继续这个话题。

"I'm going upstairs," said Asuka as she stood up, taking her book with her.

“我要上楼了。”明日香说着站起身，带着她的书一起离开。

"Going to sleep already?" asked Shinji.

"已经要睡了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No, I'll read upstairs for a while I think. What about you?"

“不了，我想上楼看会儿书。你呢？”

"I still have to wash the dishes from dinner."

"我晚餐的碗还没洗呢。"

Asuka nodded, not offering to help him. Sometimes she did, and sometimes she didn't. It all depended on her mood at the time.

明日香点点头，没有提出帮忙。有时候她会帮忙，有时候不会。一切都取决于她当时的心情。

While Shinji went into the kitchen, preparing to wash the dishes outside in the rain, Asuka walked upstairs with her book in one hand, and something else grasped in the other.

当真嗣走进厨房，准备在雨中洗碗时，明日香一手拿着书，另一手握着别的东西，走上楼去。

When darkness set in as it always did, they had initially been wondering if they could get some sort of light for the upstairs rooms. They found two flashlights inside the garage, but with limited battery life, they wished to preserve these as long as possible. In addition, Asuka had found several candles stored away far back in a closet on the ground floor. The candles they placed around the house, so when night fell, they could still have some form of light besides the fireplace in the living room.

当黑暗如常降临，他们起初还在想是否能为楼上的房间弄些光亮。他们在车库里找到了两个手电筒，但电池有限，他们希望能尽可能长时间地保存这些电量。此外，明日香在一楼的一个壁橱深处还找到了几根被收起来的蜡烛。他们将蜡烛放置在屋内各处，这样当夜幕降临时，除了客厅的壁炉外，他们还能有一些光亮。

Entering her bedroom, Asuka struck a match from the box she held, and lit the candle beside her bed. There was something oddly mystifying about candle light, and every time Asuka lit it, she watched the flame flicker back and forth. Besides her own bedroom, Shinji had one in his, and another was placed in the kitchen and dining room. With these four and the fireplace, the house was effectively lit, even at night.

走进她的卧室，明日香从手中的火柴盒里划燃一根火柴，点燃了床边的蜡烛。烛光总有一种奇异的神秘感，每次明日香点燃它时，她都会注视着火焰来回摇曳。除了她自己的卧室，真嗣的房间里也有一根，厨房和餐厅各放了一根。有了这四根蜡烛和壁炉，即使在夜晚，房子也足够明亮。

Crawling into her bed, she opened her book and continued reading, but found herself reading the same line multiple times. Closing the book with a sigh, she placed it on the end table, and dug herself further under the covers. It was hard for her to believe that they had only been here for two weeks.

她爬上床，翻开书继续阅读，却发现自己在同一行文字上反复徘徊。叹了口气，她合上书，放在床头柜上，又往被窝里钻了钻。她难以相信他们才来到这里两周。

Unwillingly, Asuka's thoughts brought her back to that first day, and the stupid thing she had done. The next day, after Asuka had crawled into Shinji's own bed, she had woken up in a daze, nearly forgetting where she was. Naturally, her vision was filled with Shinji's face, and it had taken every fiber of her being to not smack him out of habit. Granted, she did admit that the situation had largely been her fault, but Shinji as well hadn't completely resented the idea. Still, Asuka had torn herself out of bed beside him, and spent the rest of the morning downstairs sleeping on the couch. Even after Shinji had awoken her with morning breakfast, she didn't say anything about what had happened, and even now, the subject still wasn't brought up. At least she didn't have any difficulties sleeping now.

不情愿地，明日香的思绪回到了第一天，以及她所做的那件蠢事。第二天，在明日香爬进真嗣的床上后，她醒来时有些恍惚，几乎忘了自己在哪里。自然，她的视线里充满了真嗣的脸，她费了九牛二虎之力才忍住没习惯性地给他一巴掌。当然，她承认情况大部分是她的错，但真嗣也没有完全反感这个主意。尽管如此，明日香还是从他身边的床上爬起来，整个早上都在楼下沙发上补觉。即使真嗣用早餐唤醒她，她也没有提及昨晚的事，直到现在，这个话题仍未被提起。至少现在她没有睡眠困难了。

Asuka lay there for several more minutes, debating on whether to blow the candle out, or try reading again, when she eventually heard footsteps of Shinji walking upstairs. Instead of stopping at his door though, they continued down the hallway, pausing outside her own door.

明日香又在那里躺了几分钟，犹豫着是要吹灭蜡烛，还是再试着读一会儿书，这时她终于听到了真嗣上楼的脚步声。然而，他并没有在自己的门前停下，而是继续沿着走廊走，在她自己的门外停了下来。

"You didn't plan on going back downstairs did you Asuka?"

“你没打算再下楼去，对吧，明日香？”

"No, I didn't," she replied back.

“没有，我没打算，”她回答道。

"Okay. Both candles are out downstairs and the fire will start dying down probably. I'm going to bed, night."

"好了，楼下两根蜡烛都灭了，火估计也要慢慢熄灭。我去睡觉了，晚安。"

"Yeah, night," Asuka said, hearing Shinji's footsteps already disappearing from her door.

"嗯，晚安，" 明日香说道，听到真嗣的脚步声已经从她的门口消失。"

Shinji awoke earlier that morning then he had been intending, and was glad that he did. As he slid out of bed, and opened his dresser drawer to change clothes, he immediately noticed the lack of rain pounding against the roof. Looking out the window beside his bed, he looked down on the street corner below. Large puddles lined the street and pooled in areas were the road dipped, but it was obvious that it wasn't raining. Clouds still covered the sky, but the rays of the sun could just barely be seen poking out through gaps in the cloud cover.

那天早上，真嗣比他原本打算的时间更早醒来，对此他感到庆幸。当他从床上滑下来，打开抽屉准备换衣服时，立刻注意到屋顶上没有雨点的敲击声。他望向床边的窗户，俯视着下面的街道拐角。街道上排列着大大小小的水坑，低洼处积满了水，但很明显雨已经停了。云层依然覆盖着天空，但阳光的缕缕光芒勉强能透过云层的缝隙窥见。

Throwing on some jeans and a shirt, Shinji walked downstairs and got the fire started, before turning towards breakfast. For once, he would have liked a breakfast that consisted of eggs, bacon, and toast, but those ingredients were impossible to find in this current world. As such, he had to settle for oatmeal with coffee. After finishing his first cup, he heard the sound of feet coming from the stairs. Turning around, he saw Asuka coming down the stairs; it was surprising to see her up this early needless to say, but Shinji thought he had an idea why.

真嗣迅速穿上牛仔裤和衬衫，走下楼点燃了炉火，然后转向准备早餐。他多么希望今天能有一顿包含鸡蛋、培根和吐司的早餐，但在这个世界里，这些食材根本无法找到。因此，他只能满足于燕麦粥和咖啡。喝完第一杯咖啡后，他听到楼梯上传来脚步声。转过身，他看到明日香正走下楼梯；她这么早起床实在令人惊讶，但真嗣觉得他大概知道原因。

"It stopped raining!" Asuka breathlessly stated as she entered the dining room.

"雨停了！" 明日香气喘吁吁地走进餐厅，说道。

"For now at least," agreed Shinji.

"至少目前是这样，" 真嗣同意道。

"I don't care, I'm just glad it stopped. Whats for breakfast?"

"我不在乎，只是很高兴它停了。早餐吃什么？"

"Oatmeal and coffee if you want it."

"如果你想吃的话，有燕麦粥和咖啡。"

Asuka didn't seem thrilled with the idea, but she didn't complain either. Getting her own bowl and cup, she sat across from Shinji and hurriedly ate her breakfast.

明日香对这个主意似乎并不兴奋，但她也没有抱怨。她拿了自己的碗和杯子，坐在真嗣对面，匆匆吃完了早餐。

"Whats the rush?" “急什么呢？”

"I'm not staying in the house today," said Asuka in between bites.

"我今天不打算待在家里，" 明日香边吃边说。

"So you have somewhere you want to go?" asked Shinji.

"那你有什么地方想去吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Not at all. I just don't want to stay here." After a brief pause, Asuka continued with, "Do you want to come?"

"一点也没有。我只是不想待在这儿。" 短暂的停顿后，明日香接着说，"你想一起来吗？"

"I don't suppose staying here by myself would be very fun," sighed Shinji. "Even so, without any idea where to go, is there much point?"

"我想一个人待在这里不会很有趣，" 真嗣叹息道。"即便如此，没有任何线索该去哪里，又有什么意义呢？"

"Whats wrong with just driving around?"

"开车四处转转有什么不好？"

"I don't want to stop and siphon gas if we run low."

"我不想在油不够时停下来偷油。"

"Don't come if you don't want to then," said Asuka as she stood up, left the dining room, and walked upstairs to change. Shinji frowned as he watched her leave. Standing up, he gathered the dishes they had dirtied, depositing them in the sink for now. Without anything else to do, he walked into the living room, and threw himself down on the couch.

"如果你不想来，那就别来了，" 明日香说着站起身，离开了餐厅，上楼去换衣服。真嗣皱着眉头看着她离开。他站起身，收拾了他们弄脏的餐具，暂时放在水槽里。无所事事之下，他走进客厅，一头倒在沙发上。

Minutes later, Asuka came walking down the staircase, clad in simple jeans and a t-shirt with a coat she had found covering her torso.

几分钟后，明日香穿着简单的牛仔裤和 T 恤，披着一件找到的外套，走下楼梯。

"You leaving?" asked Shinji without turning towards her.

"你要走吗？" 真嗣没有回头，问道。

"Yeah," Asuka nodded as she slipped her shoes on. "I take it you aren't coming?"

"嗯，" 明日香一边穿上鞋子一边点头，"我猜你是不打算来了？"

"No," sighed Shinji, "I think I will just stay here instead."

"不了，" 真嗣叹了口气，"我想我还是留在这里吧。"

"Suit yourself," shrugged Asuka as she opened the front door and walked outside.

"随你便，" 明日香耸耸肩，打开前门走了出去。

"Don't do anything reckless," Shinji shouted after her, hoping that she heard him.

"别做任何鲁莽的事，" 真嗣在她身后喊道，希望她能听到。

Sinking lower into the couch cushions, Shinji relaxed himself as the fire continued heating the room around him. From the driveway, the sound of the car engine could be heard starting. In fact, Shinji waited until he could hear the car backing away from the house before he knew that Asuka had left.

真嗣更深地陷进沙发垫里，随着火炉继续加热房间，他放松了自己。从车道上传来汽车引擎启动的声音。实际上，真嗣一直等到能听到汽车从房子前倒车的声音，才确定明日香已经离开。

That never happened though. Shinji didn't know in what order things occurred, but the steady sound of rain began hitting the roof of the house first. This was likely the first change, but what came next was what scared Shinji.

然而，那从未发生过。真嗣不清楚事情发生的顺序，但首先听到的是雨滴稳定地敲打在屋顶的声音。这很可能是第一个变化，但接下来发生的事情才真正让真嗣感到恐惧。

The similarities were too great to just shrug off as him being worried. A certain color, the sound of screeching tires, smoke rising from the hood. In his mind, he was suddenly assaulted by a wave of images, visions as they were, not unlike those involved with Misato. These were slightly different though, as the events that unfolded were much clearer, and quite obviously, led up to the time of death, or death as it were. Shinji was an onlooker as he watched, just a simple pedestrian who watched a traffic accident. But that wasn't true at all, because there was nobody else in the world besides himself, and Asuka. The skidding of the tires, the tree the car was wrapped around, her blank face smeared against the steering wheel as blood trickled out between her eyes. The images Shinji saw shattered his mind. In no way could something like that happen. He wouldn't allow it, couldn't allow it. Letting that happen to her was out of the question, even if he had to-

这些相似之处太过明显，无法简单地归咎于他的担忧。某种颜色，刺耳的刹车声，引擎盖上冒出的烟雾。在他的脑海中，突然涌入了一系列图像，这些幻象与美里所经历的有些相似。不过，这些图像略有不同，因为展开的事件更加清晰，而且显然，这些事件直接导致了死亡时刻，或者说死亡本身。真嗣作为一个旁观者，看着这一切，就像一个普通的行人目睹了一场交通事故。但这完全不是真的，因为在这个世界上除了他自己和明日香之外，没有其他人。轮胎的滑行声，被车缠绕的树，她那张空白的面孔贴在方向盘上，鲜血从她的眼睛之间缓缓流出。真嗣看到的这些图像粉碎了他的心灵。无论如何，这样的事情都不可能发生。他不会允许，也不能允许。让这样的事情发生在她身上是绝对不可能的，即使他不得不——

All too suddenly, Shinji was being shaken awake by somebody. He hadn't noticed it, but he had slid off the couch, blacking out in the process. The person who was shaking him was slowly beginning to come into focus, and as her face became clear, Shinji found himself acting on instinct.

突然间，真嗣感到有人在摇晃他，试图将他唤醒。他并未察觉到自己已从沙发上滑落，并在过程中失去了意识。那个摇晃他的人影渐渐清晰起来，当她的面容变得清晰时，真嗣发现自己本能地做出了反应。

"Shinji...Shinji? Hey are you-OW! What are you-"

"真嗣...真嗣？嘿，你——哎哟！你在干什——"

Asuka had been tugging on Shinji's shoulder, trying to bring him back to the land of the living. Quite suddenly though, he had lunged at her, pinning her down on the couch, and was now straddling her waist. This sudden change not only startled Asuka, but also scared her briefly. Shinji had moved way faster than she had thought possible, and now they were in this position.

明日香一直在拉扯真嗣的肩膀，试图将他带回现实世界。然而，突然间，他猛地扑向她，将她按倒在沙发上，现在正跨坐在她的腰间。这一突如其来的变化不仅让明日香感到惊讶，还让她短暂地害怕起来。真嗣的动作比她想象的要快得多，现在他们处于这种姿势。

"Shinji, what are you doing!?" Asuka began angrily, the fear quickly disappearing.

"真嗣，你在干什么！？" 明日香愤怒地开口，恐惧迅速消散。

He didn't know. Shinji didn't know what he was doing. His mind still held traces of what he had seen, but all that mattered was that Asuka was still here. That was why he had reacted as he had. It all seemed so real, but the sight of Asuka in front of him and okay, must have triggered something within him to act as he did.

他不知道。真嗣不知道自己在做什么。他的脑海中仍残留着所见之景的痕迹，但最重要的是，明日香还在这里。这就是他为何会有那样的反应。一切似乎如此真实，但眼前安然无恙的明日香，必定触动了他内心某处，使他做出了那样的举动。

"Get off of me you idiot!" shouted Asuka.

“从我身上滚开，你这个白痴！”明日香喊道。

Before Shinji was given time to reply, Asuka had pushed against his chest with both her hands, sending him reeling backwards and falling off the couch.

在真嗣有机会回答之前，明日香已经用双手推着他的胸口，将他向后推倒，摔下了沙发。

"What the fuck was that about!? I came back in because it started raining, and I see you passed out beside the couch. Next second, I'm trying to wake you and then find myself pinned to the couch. What the hell were you thinking?"

“你他妈的到底在搞什么鬼！？我回来是因为开始下雨了，看到你倒在沙发旁边。下一秒，我试图叫醒你，结果自己却被按在沙发上。你到底在想什么？”

Shinji opened his mouth, but nothing came out. How exactly was he supposed to explain what he saw? He had already told her what he had seen with Misato, but this was inherently different. He had seen Asuka dead, had seen her die. How was he supposed to communicate those images to the person in question?

真嗣张开了嘴，却什么也没说出来。他到底该怎么解释他所看到的呢？他已经告诉过她关于美里的事情，但这次本质上是不同的。他看到了明日香死去，亲眼目睹了她的死亡。他该如何将这些画面传达给当事人呢？

"I-I don't know," began Shinji meekly.

“我……我不知道，”真嗣怯生生地开口。

"You don't know?" Asuka said mockingly. "You don't know why you passed out? What if I just left? What if I didn't know you were like that? What would have happened?"

“你不知道？”明日香嘲讽地说，“你不知道自己为什么会晕倒吗？如果我就这么走了呢？如果我不知道你是这样的呢？会发生什么？”

It took Shinji several seconds to register what Asuka was talking about. Simply put, she didn't seem worried about him lunging at her, so much as she was worried about him suddenly passing out.

真嗣花了好几秒才反应过来明日香在说什么。简单来说，她似乎并不担心他会扑向她，而是更担心他会突然昏倒。

"Has this happened before?" asked Asuka sternly.

“以前发生过这种情况吗？”明日香严肃地问道。

"No...it-" “不...这——”

That wasn't true though. But still, explaining it to Asuka was-

虽然那不是真的。但即便如此，向明日香解释这件事还是——

Asuka glared down at him for several seconds before groaning, and stood up.

明日香瞪了他几秒钟，然后叹了口气，站起身来。

"Damn it Shinji! If you don't have anything to say, then I'm leaving."

"该死，真嗣！如果你没什么要说的，那我就走了。"

It was only these words that jogged Shinji's brain, as he remembered the vision of what he saw. As Asuka turned to leave again, Shinji found his legs moving with no coherent thought. All that mattered, was that he prevented Asuka from leaving. In a flash, he was at the door, and firmly holding onto her wrist.

正是这些话唤醒了真嗣的思绪，他记起了所见的那一幕。当明日香再次转身要离开时，真嗣发现自己不由自主地动了起来，没有明确的念头。唯一重要的是，他必须阻止明日香离开。一瞬间，他已站在门口，紧紧抓住她的手腕。

"Don't go," he said simply.

"别走，"他简单地说道。

Whipping her head around, she looked down at his hand that was holding onto her wrist.

她猛地转过头，目光落在紧抓她手腕的那只手上。

"Why don't you want me to go?" asked Asuka.

“你为什么不想让我走？”明日香问道。

Again, Shinji had no way to express to Asuka the urgency of this situation, but he still couldn't let her go.

又一次，真嗣无法向明日香表达这一情况的紧迫性，但他仍然不能让她离开。

"I'm worried," is all Shinji managed to say.

"我很担心，" 真嗣只能说出这句话。

Asuka eyed him for several seconds before she shook off his grasp. They stood like that in the doorway of their house, while the raining continued pouring down several feet away.

明日香盯着他看了几秒钟，然后甩开了他的手。他们就这样站在家门口，雨继续在几英尺外倾盆而下。

"Why are you worried?" asked Asuka quietly.

“你为什么担心？”明日香轻声问道。

"I...I can't say," said Shinji, not quite meeting Asuka's eyes.

“我...我说不上来，”真嗣说道，没有直视明日香的眼睛。

"Does it have something to do with what you saw in the Geofront?" asked Asuka.

“这和你在大地裂缝看到的有关吗？”明日香问道。

Shinji wanted to nod, but was unable to. This and that were fundamentally different. Even if he knew Misato at one point, he had no memories of her. He knew Asuka though, had been living with her for two months. The two deaths were completely different. That person, was standing right in front of him, but he couldn't communicate what he had seen because it was too dreadful.

真嗣想点头，却做不到。这件事和那件事本质上是不同的。即使他曾经认识美里，他对她也没有任何记忆。但他认识明日香，已经和她一起生活了两个月。这两次死亡是完全不同的。那个人，就站在他面前，但他无法传达他所看到的，因为那太可怕了。

"Shinji...I don't know if you saw something, like what happened with Misato, but if you ask me to stay, then I will."

"真嗣...我不知道你是否看到了什么，就像之前和美里发生的那样，但如果你让我留下，那我就留下。"

Asuka gave him a small smile, that was somewhat sad, and walked passed him. This wasn't good enough though, and Shinji knew it. Whirling around, he grabbed her hand again, firmly gripping it.

明日香给了他一个略带忧伤的小微笑，然后从他身边走过。但这还不够，真嗣心里清楚。他猛地转身，再次紧紧抓住她的手。

"Shinji what-" "真嗣，你干什么-"

"You died," he stated. This certainly caught Asuka off guard.

"你死了，"他陈述道。这无疑让明日香措手不及。

"I died? What-" "我死了？什么-"

"If you had left, you would have died."

"如果你离开，你就会死。"

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"I'm sorry, but I don't want to think about it."

"对不起，但我不想去想这件事。"

"That isn't good enough."

"这还不够好。"

"Isn't it?" asked Shinji. "What happened at the Geofront was different. This was...I watched it all happen, and couldn't do anything to stop it. The car, the tree, your face...I shouldn't have to repeat those things, especially towards the person who I saw die."

"不是吗？" 真嗣问道。"在 Geofront 发生的事情不一样。这次是...我眼睁睁看着一切发生，却无能为力。那辆车，那棵树，你的脸...我不应该重复这些事情，尤其是对那个我亲眼看着死去的人。"

"But I'm right here," Asuka insisted.

"但我就在这儿啊," 明日香坚持道。

"And if you hadn't come back inside because it started raining, and just drove on your way, what then?"

"如果你没有因为开始下雨而返回屋内，而是继续开车上路，那又会怎样？"

Asuka couldn't reply to that, and instead chose something else to ask.

明日香无法回答这个问题，于是选择了另一个问题来问。

"Why did you lunge at me then? You hurt me when you pinned me against the couch."

“那你当时为什么要扑向我？你把我按在沙发上弄疼我了。”

"How would you react if you had just seen me die, only to find me inches away from your face?"

“如果你刚刚目睹了我死去，结果却发现我近在咫尺地出现在你面前，你会怎么反应？”

Again, Asuka fell silent. Shinji was right, she probably would have acted in a similar manner.

又一次，明日香沉默了。真嗣说得没错，她大概也会做出类似的举动。

Running his hands across his face, Shinji walked over to the couch and laid down on it. Asuka continued standing near the door, unsure of what she could say.

伸出手揉了揉脸，真嗣走到沙发旁躺了下来。明日香依旧站在门口，不知道该说些什么。

"What is happening to me?" mumbled Shinji into the couch cushions. "Why do I regenerate from wounds? Why am I having these visions?"

“我这是怎么了？”真嗣埋在沙发垫里喃喃自语，“为什么我受了伤能自愈？为什么我会看到这些幻象？”

"Shinji-" “真嗣——”

"What the fuck happened to me in those four months that I can't remember damn it!" Shinji swore.

"这四个月里我到底经历了什么鬼，该死的一点都记不起来！" 真嗣咒骂道。

Asuka looked hesitantly back at him. What could she do in a situation like this? Shinji had seen her die? Even now, she still didn't rightfully understand that. Still, seeing something like that had clearly left a deep impact on him. He really did care a lot about her, if it had affected him that much.

明日香犹豫地回头看向他。在这种情况下，她能做什么呢？真嗣目睹了她的死亡？即便现在，她仍未完全理解这一点。然而，那件事显然给他留下了深刻的印象。如果那件事对他影响如此之大，足以证明他真的很在乎她。

Knowing what she had to do, Asuka walked around to the front of the couch. Since Shinji was still laying down on it, she moved his legs slightly, creating a spot for her to sit. Shinji didn't give any resistance, or even acknowledge that Asuka was sitting next to him.

知道她必须做什么，明日香绕到沙发前。由于真嗣还躺在上面，她轻轻移动了他的腿，腾出地方让自己坐下。真嗣没有表现出任何抗拒，甚至没有意识到明日香坐在了他旁边。

"Shinji, sit up for a second." It wasn't an order, but a request.

“真嗣，坐起来一会儿。”这不是命令，而是请求。

Slowly, Shinji did, hardly paying attention as he did. Scooting closer to him, Asuka positioned herself directly beside him. Calmly, Asuka wrapped her arms around Shinji, and brought him into a comforting hug. She didn't say anything, because she didn't need to. The words were spoken in the embrace, telling him that everything was all right. He didn't need to worry about these things, because it wasn't just him that was enduring them, but Asuka as well. As Shinji discovered more about himself, Asuka would be beside him, supporting him no matter what.

真嗣慢慢地照做了，几乎没怎么注意。明日香挪近了一些，直接坐在他旁边。平静地，明日香张开双臂抱住真嗣，给了他一个安慰的拥抱。她什么也没说，因为她不需要说。话语在拥抱中传达，告诉他一切都会好起来的。他不必担心这些事情，因为不只是他在承受，明日香也在。随着真嗣对自己了解的加深，明日香会一直在他身边，无论发生什么都会支持他。

Breaking off the hug, Asuka's face was lightly colored pink, but she didn't seem terribly embarrassed by the situation. It was only a hug after all.

松开拥抱，明日香的脸颊微微泛红，但她似乎并未因这一情景而感到特别尴尬。毕竟，这只是一个拥抱而已。

"Thank you Asuka," said Shinji beside her. Glancing over at him, Asuka couldn't say that Shinji was smiling, but he didn't look dejected anymore.

"谢谢你，明日香。" 真嗣在她身旁说道。明日香瞥了他一眼，虽然无法断言真嗣在微笑，但他看起来不再沮丧了。

"You worry too much," said Asuka as she stood up. "Though still...I do appreciate it. Ah, enough of this depressing topic. If I'm gonna be stuck here today, I may as well enjoy myself. Wait here for a minute Shinji, I'm gonna grab a few things."

"你担心过头了，" 明日香站起来说道，"不过...我还是挺感激的。啊，别再提这些让人郁闷的话题了。既然今天我得待在这里，不如好好享受一下。在这里等我一会儿，真嗣，我去拿点东西。"

Before Shinji was given any time to ask questions, Asuka had bolted out of the room.

真嗣还没来得及问什么，明日香已经冲出了房间。

'What is she thinking?' wondered Shinji.

'她在想什么呢？' 真嗣心想。

For an answer, Shinji only had to wait a couple of minutes, when Asuka came back into the living room, carrying a chair, and having a towel slung over her shoulder. Placing the chair in front of the couch, she pointed to Shinji and said, "Sit."

答案不久便揭晓，只消几分钟，明日香便带着一把椅子回到客厅，肩上搭着一条毛巾。她将椅子放在沙发前，指着真嗣说：“坐下。”

Not seeming to have any choice, Shinji did as he was told, not having a clue what she was doing. Asuka decided that it was about time she explained herself though.

真嗣似乎别无选择，只得照做，完全摸不着头脑她要干什么。不过，明日香觉得是时候解释一下了。

"You need a haircut," Asuka stated.

“你需要剪头发了。”明日香直言道。

Shinji gulped involuntarily, and attempted to resist, but Asuka had a firm grip on his shoulder. He understood what she had said about enjoying herself.

真嗣不由自主地咽了口唾沫，试图抵抗，但明日香紧紧抓住他的肩膀。他明白她所说的享受是什么意思。

"Umm, Asuka, I don't think this is really-"

“呃，明日香，我觉得这真的不太-”

"While I was hugging you, I noticed how messy your hair is; it's sticking up all over the place."

“我抱着你的时候，注意到你的头发有多乱；到处都翘起来了。”

"I don't need a haircut," Shinji firmly replied.

"我不需要剪头发，" 真嗣坚定地回答。

"Since it started raining again, I need something to occupy myself with."

"既然又开始下雨了，我需要找点事情做。"

"But giving me a haircut is-"

"但给我剪头发这件事——"

"Oh shut it Shinji," Asuka sighed as she removed a pair of scissors from her back pocket. "Or do you not trust me to do a good job?"

"哦，闭嘴吧，真嗣，" 明日香叹了口气，从后裤袋里掏出一对剪刀。"还是说，你不相信我能做好？"

"I trust that you could do a good job if you wanted to, but I'm afraid that you'll hack off all my hair on only one side."

"我相信如果你愿意的话，你能做得很好，但我担心你会把我一边的头发全剪掉。"

"You don't have much faith in me, do you?" frowned Asuka.

"你对我的信任可真不多，是吧？" 明日香皱眉道。

"In some things, yes. In this, no."

在某些事情上，是的。在这件事上，不。

Without bothering to reply to him, Asuka began snipping Shinji's hair. Immediately, he started struggling, but Asuka said, "If you move around like an idiot, I'm gonna accidentally cut you."

懒得回应他，明日香开始修剪真嗣的头发。他立刻开始挣扎，但明日香说：“你要是像个傻子一样乱动，我可不敢保证不会失手剪到你。”

"So what. It'll just end up healing anyway."

那又怎样。反正最后都会愈合的。

Asuka paused as Shinji said this, realizing the tone in his voice. He had reverted back to his emotionless self from earlier.

听到这话，明日香顿了顿，察觉到真嗣语气中的变化。他又回到了之前那种毫无情感的状态。

"Still, it'll hurt, and I don't want to hurt you."

“尽管如此，还是会痛，我不想让你受伤。”

Asuka said this, dispelling the momentary silence. Shinji was glad that she did so, because he hadn't meant what he said. His anger was getting the better of him.

明日香打破了短暂的沉默，真嗣为此感到庆幸，因为他刚才的话并非真心。他的愤怒正逐渐占据上风。

"Fine, do whatever you want," groaned Shinji as he leaned back into the chair, resigning himself to the haircut.

“好吧，随你便。”真嗣叹了口气，向后靠在椅子上，无奈地接受了剪发。

"I promise not to turn you bald."

“我保证不会把你剃成光头。”

That did bring a brief chuckle out of Shinji, before the only sound resonating in the room came from the scissors that Asuka was working. When Asuka was young, she had a very vague memory of her mother giving her a haircut when her hair had initially started growing out. For some reason, what Asuka was doing now, reminded her of that memory. Initially, this had been Asuka's attempt at fixing the depressing atmosphere that had been lingering over them earlier, but now she was actually enjoying herself. As she began humming softly though, Shinji spoke.

这话让真嗣短暂地笑了一声，随后房间里只剩下明日香手中的剪刀声。明日香小时候隐约记得母亲在她头发刚开始长出来时给她剪过一次发。不知为何，现在她做的事情让她想起了那个记忆。起初，这只是明日香试图打破之前笼罩在他们身上的压抑气氛，但现在她真的乐在其中。正当她开始轻声哼唱时，真嗣开口了。

"Hey Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"It's too late to change your mind about this."

"现在改变主意已经太迟了。"

"That wasn't it. I was just wondering what you were about to say yesterday."

"不是那个意思。我只是好奇你昨天想说些什么。"

"Yesterday?" puzzled Asuka as she tried to recall what they had been talking about, but the memory came quickly back to her.

"昨天？" 明日香困惑地试图回忆他们当时在谈论什么，但记忆很快回到了她的脑海中。

"Oh, that," said Asuka as she paused in her work. "Like I said, it was stupid really."

"哦，那个啊，" 明日香停下手中的工作说道，"就像我说的，真的很蠢。"

"Stupid or not, I want to hear what you were thinking."

"不管蠢不蠢，我想听听你是怎么想的。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Does there have to be a reason?" shrugged Shinji.

"非得有理由吗？" 真嗣耸耸肩。

"I suppose not," mumbled Asuka, "but, whatever. I was thinking about the seasonal change, and how it's obvious now that we're in the winter season. My thoughts eventually went to December, and then Christmas after that. Though celebrating it is a little..."

"我想不是，" 明日香咕哝着，"不过，无所谓了。我在想季节的变化，现在很明显我们进入了冬季。我的思绪最终转向了十二月，然后是圣诞节。虽然庆祝它有点……"

Asuka's sentence broke, aware of the unusual silence that had engulfed them.

明日香的话突然中断，她意识到周围笼罩着一种不寻常的沉默。

"Are you laughing!?" asked Asuka, her face starting to turn red from both embarrassment and anger.

"你在笑吗！？" 明日香问道，她的脸开始因尴尬和愤怒而变红。

Shinji had started quivering in his chair, completely unaware of the angry girl still holding scissors above him.

真嗣坐在椅子上开始颤抖，完全没有意识到那位愤怒的女孩还手持剪刀悬在他头顶。

"Do you want me to make you bald!"

"你想让我把你剃成光头吗！"

"No, sorry Asuka, I just never imagined I'd hear you talk about Christmas."

"不，抱歉，明日香，我只是从未想过会听到你谈论圣诞节。"

"Is that wrong? Sorry if that seems unlike me."

"这有什么不对吗？如果这看起来不像我，那我道歉。"

"I just never thought you'd bring it up. I know it was something I'd never think to celebrate with the world as it is."

"我从未想过你会提起这个。我知道在这个世界上，我从未想过要庆祝这种事。"

"Is something wrong with that?"

"这有什么不对吗？"

"It just seems, unimportant I guess. Besides, we're the only ones here."

"只是觉得，大概是不重要的吧。再说，这里也只有我们两个人。"

"Thats got nothing to do with it," said Asuka as she crossed her arms.

“这跟那没关系，”明日香说着，双臂交叉抱在胸前。

"So what? You want to hang up lights and get a Christmas tree for this place?"

“那又怎样？你想在这儿挂上灯饰，弄棵圣诞树吗？”

"Like I said, stupid idea," said Asuka returning to her work.

“就像我说的，真是个蠢主意。”明日香说着，又回到了她的工作上。

"Not stupid, just strange coming from you."

"不傻，只是从你嘴里说出来有点奇怪。"

"I swear I'm gonna cut off the rest of your hair if you don't shut up."

"我发誓，你再不闭嘴，我就把你剩下的头发也剪了。"

"Okay, okay, I won't mention that. But still, do you have fond memories of Christmas?"

"好了好了，我不提了。不过，你真的对圣诞节没什么美好回忆吗？"

Asuka stopped in mid cut, remembering certain memories. Up until a point, Christmas had been enjoyable for her, but after her mother died, things had gone downhill. Even after she had left her father, she usually celebrated Christmas by herself. She enjoyed the holiday, but hardly had any memories she considered fond.

明日香在切割中停了下来，回忆起某些记忆。直到某个时刻，圣诞节对她来说还是愉快的，但在母亲去世后，一切都急转直下。即使她离开了父亲，通常也是独自庆祝圣诞节。她喜欢这个节日，但几乎没有留下什么她认为美好的回忆。

"A couple," lied Asuka. "What about yourself though?"

"两个人，"明日香撒了个谎。"那你呢？"

"Do you even need to ask that?" wondered Shinji. "I don't think I've ever gotten anything from my father, and I was too young to remember spending time with my mother."

"你还需要问吗？" 真嗣疑惑道。"我不认为我父亲曾给我买过什么，而且我太小了，记不清和母亲共度的时光。"

"Then what did you do?"

"那后来你做了什么？"

"Nothing normally. Sometimes I'd go to the middle of whatever town I was in at the time, and look at the giant Christmas tree they usually had displayed there. But other than that, nothing."

"没什么特别的。有时候我会去当时所在城镇的中心，看看他们通常在那里展示的巨大圣诞树。除此之外，也没什么。"

"No presents? No family gatherings?"

"没有礼物？没有家庭聚会吗？"

"My father would never think of giving me presents, and I've never even met my grandparents."

我父亲从不会想到给我礼物，而我甚至从未见过我的祖父母。

Asuka reflected that even she didn't have as bad a time as Shinji did. She always received presents from her grandparents every Christmas, and sometimes spent Christmas dinner at their house before she started college. But Shinji didn't have anybody to spend that time with.

明日香思忖着，就连她自己也没有像真嗣那样度过糟糕的时光。每年圣诞节，她总能收到祖父母送的礼物，有时在上大学前还会去他们家共进圣诞晚餐。但真嗣却无人相伴共度这段时光。

"Do you hate Christmas then?" asked Asuka.

"那你讨厌圣诞节吗？" 明日香问道。

"I don't, but I've never experienced it either."

"我不讨厌，但我也没经历过。"

It was such a strange thing to say, never having experienced Christmas before.

从未经历过圣诞节，这话听起来真是奇怪。

"How would you feel about celebrating it then?"

"那你觉得庆祝一下如何？"

"Like I said, that seems unimportant compared to everything else that has happened."

"就像我说的，与发生的一切相比，这似乎不那么重要。"

"Leaving those things aside, I think some holiday cheer could do us some good."

"抛开那些不谈，我觉得一些节日的欢乐对我们有好处。"

"Are you feeling okay Asuka?"

“你感觉还好吗，明日香？”

The response Shinji got was unpleasant, since Asuka stamped roughly down on his foot.

真嗣得到的回应可不怎么愉快，因为明日香重重地踩了他的脚。

Though Shinji had misgivings when Asuka first started cutting his hair, after he saw what she had done, he had to admit it was a good job. At least she didn't make him look hideous. In fact, his hair was back to the length it had been when he had woken up on the beach of Tokyo-3.

尽管真嗣一开始对明日香给他剪头发有些疑虑，但当他看到成果后，不得不承认她做得很好。至少她没让他看起来很丑。事实上，他的头发长度已经恢复到了他在第三新东京市海滩上醒来时的样子。

"I told you to trust me," said Asuka as Shinji stood up, leaving the chair.

"“我告诉过你要相信我，”明日香说道，而真嗣站起身，离开了椅子。”

"Well, it isn't bad at least," replied Shinji as he glanced at his reflection in the hand mirror.

"“嗯，至少还不错，”真嗣回答，同时瞥了一眼手持镜中的自己。”

"Hmph," snorted Asuka. "“哼，”明日香哼了一声。”

"I'll clean this up since you did give me the hair cut."

既然你给我剪了头发，我会清理干净的。

"Good, because I didn't intend to sweep your hair up anyway," said Asuka as she crossed her arms.

"好，反正我也没打算把你的头发梳上去，"明日香说着，双臂交叉抱在胸前。

Thankfully, the towel that Asuka grabbed, had been placed under the chair, so that most of Shinji's hair fell onto it. Still, there was some that fell directly onto the carpet, and Shinji spent several minutes cleaning this up. Asuka seemed to have returned the chair to the dining room, and placed the scissors somewhere as well. Speaking of which, Shinji had completely forgotten to ask where she had gotten them.

幸好，明日香拿的那条毛巾放在椅子下面，所以大部分真嗣的头发都落在了上面。不过，还是有几根直接掉在了地毯上，真嗣花了好几分钟才清理干净。明日香似乎已经把椅子搬回了餐厅，剪刀也放到了某个地方。说到这个，真嗣完全忘了问她是从哪儿弄来的剪刀。

Ignoring that for now, Shinji ran his hand through his newly cut hair. In retrospect, it might have been a better idea to keep it long, considering the winter season was upon them. Then again, Asuka wouldn't have taken no for an answer anyway.

暂时不去想这些，真嗣用手梳理了一下刚剪过的头发。回想起来，考虑到冬天已经来临，留长发或许是个更好的主意。不过话说回来，明日香无论如何也不会接受否定的回答。

As Asuka came back into the living room, she saw Shinji moving his hand through his hair, and laughed lightly.

当明日香回到客厅时，她看到真嗣正用手梳理着头发，轻声笑了起来。

"So you do appreciate the job I did."

“看来你确实欣赏我做的工作。”

"I never said I didn't," said Shinji as he turned to her. "What about yourself though? Isn't yours getting unbearable?"

“我从没说过我不欣赏，”真嗣转向她说，“不过你自己呢？你的不也变得难以忍受了吗？”

"I wouldn't say that. Besides, I always wanted my hair longer, but other things got in the way."

"我不会这么说。再说了，我一直想留长头发，但总有其他事情挡道。"

"Like?" "比如？"

"Being an Evangelion pilot comes to mind. My mother had hair that went down to her waist, and I always wanted to grow my hair out to that length, so now I think I will. Not like there's anything to get in the way of that now."

"成为《新世纪福音战士》的驾驶员这件事浮现在脑海中。我母亲有着及腰的长发，我一直想留到那么长，现在我想我会这么做的。不像现在有什么能阻碍我。"

"If you say so," shrugged Shinji.

"如果你这么说的话，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"

Sitting down on the couch, Asuka asked Shinji, "Can I ask you something...about earlier?"

坐在沙发上，明日香问真嗣：“我能问你件事吗...关于刚才的？”

By earlier, Shinji assumed she meant about the vision he had had. He was much calmer now, and nodded his head without hesitation.

起初，真嗣以为她指的是他曾有过的那个幻象。现在他平静多了，毫不犹豫地点了点头。

"When you saw...what you saw, how did you view it."

“当你看到……你所看到的，你是怎么看待它的。”

"What do you mean?" asked Shinji after several seconds of silence.

“你是什么意思？”真嗣在几秒钟的沉默后问道。

"Were you in the passenger seat, or watching from above like a dream, or-"

"你是坐在副驾驶座上，还是像梦境一样从上方俯瞰，或者——"

"I was watching as though I was just somebody passing by, that witnessed a car accident."

"我就像一个路过的旁观者，目睹了一场车祸。"

"And you saw the whole thing or?"

"那你看到了整个过程吗？"

Shinji frowned, not wanting to go into explicit details, surprised that Asuka was continuing to ask these question.

真嗣皱了皱眉，不想细说详情，对明日香继续追问这些问题感到惊讶。

"It all flashed by, and I only got brief glimpses of everything, but it was clear what happened."

“一切转瞬即逝，我只瞥见了零星片段，但事情已经很清楚了。”

"Why me though? Why did you specifically see me?"

“但为什么是我？为什么你偏偏看到了我？”

"It isn't like there's anybody else around."

"这里又没有别人在。"

"True, but then what about Misato? Why did you see her, and something that must have happened a while ago at that."

"确实，但美里呢？你为什么会看到她，而且还是发生在很久以前的事。"

"I've no idea," mumbled Shinji.

""我不知道，"" 真嗣嘟囔道。

Glancing at Shinji, Asuka could tell that he wasn't keen on continuing the discussion, so Asuka decided she'd drop the subject. She was curious about the whole thing. What exactly had happened to Shinji? It was possible to assume that this had happened because his leg had broken, and then healed itself surprisingly fast. When she thought of it in those terms, if Shinji hadn't broken his leg, and changed somehow, she may be dying right now in a car accident. She couldn't help but shudder at the thought.

瞥了一眼真嗣，明日香看出他并不想继续这个话题，于是决定就此打住。她对整件事充满好奇。真嗣究竟经历了什么？或许可以假设，这一切是因为他的腿骨折后，又惊人地迅速愈合。这么一想，如果真嗣没有骨折并因此发生某种变化，她现在可能已经在车祸中丧命了。想到这里，她不禁打了个寒颤。

"What do you plan on making for dinner?" asked Asuka, moving away from the topic.

"你打算晚餐做什么？" 明日香转移了话题。

"I hadn't thought about it," said Shinji.

“我之前没想过，”真嗣说。

"Hmm, well, if you need help, I can lend I hand."

"嗯，好吧，如果你需要帮助，我可以伸出援手。"

"Thanks," muttered Shinji as he stood up. Asuka wanted to say something, but could clearly tell that Shinji wanted to be left alone for now. Her questions about what he saw, had a negative impact apparently.

"谢谢，" 真嗣咕哝着站起身。明日香想说什么，但明显感觉到真嗣现在想一个人待着。她关于他所见之物的疑问，显然产生了负面影响。

Leaving Asuka in the living room, Shinji walked upstairs to his bedroom, and laid himself down on his bed. How many times had he run away from things in his life? He couldn't count the times. No matter where he went, he disassociated himself from people. Now though, it wasn't as if he could take that route. Admittedly strange, as things were, there was no getting around the fact that him and Asuka were living together. He couldn't ignore her presence, and she couldn't ignore his. This posed a problem, as Shinji was worried about his state of mind.

留下明日香在客厅，真嗣走上楼回到自己的卧室，躺在床上。他一生中逃避过多少次？数不清了。无论去哪里，他都与人们保持距离。但现在，这条路已经行不通了。尽管情况确实奇怪，但不可否认的是，他和明日香现在同居一室。他无法忽视她的存在，她也无法忽视他的。这带来了一个问题，因为真嗣担心自己的心理状态。

Why now? Why did he have this vision now? Why didn't he have it when the building had fallen on them? Was it because something had changed within him, like a switch being thrown when his leg had broken? Why were these things happening to him?

为何是现在？为何他此刻会有这样的幻象？为何不是在建筑物倒塌压在他们身上时？是因为他内心发生了某种变化，就像断腿时触发的开关一样吗？为何这些事情会发生在他的身上？

This wasn't even the half of it, and Shinji was more troubled about this second part. He couldn't explain it, but there was another feeling he got, like an extension of himself. There weren't two of him, but it felt like there was some force within him, that he could manipulate and control if he put his mind to it. Suppressing this force normally came easily, but during times when his anger flared up, he found his control slipping, and this was happening more often than not. He thought about bringing this up to Asuka on more than one occasion during these past two weeks, but he had always decided against it.

这还只是冰山一角，而真嗣对这第二部分更为困扰。他无法解释，但有一种感觉，仿佛是他自己的延伸。并非有两个他，而是感觉体内有一种力量，只要他下定决心，就能操控和掌控。通常压制这种力量很容易，但在愤怒爆发时，他发现自己的控制力在减弱，这种情况越来越频繁。过去两周里，他不止一次想过向明日香提起这件事，但每次都决定作罢。

Asuka was another problem. No matter how much Shinji tried to deny it, he had become close to Asuka in a way he had never imagined. Certainly not when he had first interacted with her on the beach of Tokyo-3. During these two months spent glued to each others side, he had become accustomed to her, admired her, marveled at her ingenuity, and even enjoyed her stubbornness on occasion. Attraction was not something he had thought would sprout out of this strange relationship. If his current self, had told his past self, who had just met Asuka, what would eventually happen, his past self would likely hit his present self.

明日香是另一个问题。无论真嗣如何试图否认，他与明日香之间的关系已变得亲密，这是他始料未及的。当然，初次在第三新东京市的沙滩上与她相遇时，他绝未预料到这一点。这两个月来，他们形影不离，真嗣逐渐习惯了她，欣赏她的才华，惊叹于她的机智，偶尔甚至享受她的倔强。他从未想过，这种奇妙的关系会滋生出情感。如果现在的自己告诉刚认识明日香时的自己，最终会发生什么，过去的自己恐怕会揍现在的自己一顿吧。

Was this feeling usual for somebody in his situation, and how did Asuka feel as well? It was almost impossible to gauge her thoughts, even after living together for so long. One minute she would be friendly, and the next, she would be her angry stubborn self. He could never tell what she was thinking, or what her feelings were. He didn't know whether she was closing herself off, or if he just didn't understand her. Shinji had never been good with people in general, but neither had he been together with somebody for a prolonged period of time, not to mention somebody of the opposite sex and same age him.

这种感觉对于他这种情况的人来说常见吗？明日香又是怎么想的呢？即使同居了这么久，也几乎无法揣测她的心思。她时而友好，时而又是那个固执易怒的自己。他永远猜不透她在想什么，她的感受如何。他不知道是她把自己封闭起来了，还是他根本就不理解她。总的来说，真嗣不擅长与人打交道，更不用说与异性同龄人长期相处了。

Rolling onto his back, he stared up at his ceiling, hearing the rain pounding down on the roof above, reverberating in his own eardrum. He couldn't stay like this, and was unsure whether things could stay like this either. Him and Asuka were trapped in this house like a couple of caged animals, with a very limited amount of space. What would happen, and what could happen?

他翻身仰躺，盯着天花板，听着雨点敲打在屋顶上，回荡在他的耳膜里。他不能就这样下去，也不确定事情是否能保持现状。他和明日香像被关在笼子里的动物一样困在这房子里，空间非常有限。会发生什么，可能发生什么？

Shinji didn't bother going back downstairs until the sun began setting, and then knew that he should at least start dinner. Besides, it was better to start before Asuka began complaining.

直到太阳开始落山，真嗣才懒得下楼，然后他知道至少应该开始准备晚餐了。再说，在明日香开始抱怨之前开始总比之后好。

Walking downstairs, he saw Asuka laying on the couch, her hair spilling over one of the arms. He couldn't see what she was holding, but he had to assume that it was a book of sorts. Speaking from the open doorway, he said, "I'm gonna start dinner soon, so if you still want to help-"

走下楼梯，他看到明日香躺在沙发上，头发散落在一只扶手上。他看不清她手里拿着什么，但猜想应该是一本书。站在敞开的门口，他说道：“我马上要做晚饭了，如果你还想帮忙的话——”

As he said this, Asuka sat upright, and turned towards him.

说着这话，明日香直起身，转向他。

"Yeah, I still want to help," she replied.

“嗯，我还是想帮忙，”她回答道。

Setting her book down on the couch, she stood up, and followed Shinji into the kitchen

她把书放在沙发上，站起身，跟着真嗣走进厨房

"What do you plan on making?" she asked.

"你打算做什么？" 她问道。

Shinji stood in front of the counter, pondering this. Most of their food they had stored away in the pantry and cupboards. It felt strange not having them placed in backpacks, but this was the proper way they were supposed to be stored anyway.

真嗣站在柜台前，思考着这个问题。他们的大部分食物都存放在食品储藏室和橱柜里。没有把它们放在背包里感觉很奇怪，但无论如何，这才是它们应该存放的正确方式。

"Rice to begin with I suppose," frowned Shinji as he looked at their supplies. "Steamed vegetables maybe...the people that lived here before had some seasonings that I can use. Hmm, I can sauté the lot of it I suppose. Lets see, soy sauce, salt, pinch of garlic powder-"

"首先应该是米饭吧，" 真嗣皱着眉头看着他们的补给品。"或许再来点蒸蔬菜...之前住在这里的人留下了一些调味料，我可以使用。嗯，我想我可以炒一下。让我看看，酱油，盐，一点大蒜粉..."

"Peanut oil?" offered Asuka.

"花生油？" 明日香提议道。

"Yeah, that'll work," nodded Shinji. "Other than that, I'm not sure what else."

"嗯，这样行得通，" 真嗣点头道。"除此之外，我不确定还有什么别的。"

"I want meat," Asuka said suddenly.

"我想吃肉，" 明日香突然说道。"

"Unless, you want spam, we don't have many options."

"除非你想吃罐头午餐肉，我们没有太多选择。"

They had found an assortment of spam in the back of one of the cupboards. Neither had ever tried it, but couldn't imagine canned meat would taste very good.

他们在其中一个橱柜的后面发现了一堆各式各样的午餐肉。两人都从未尝试过，但想象中罐头肉的味道应该不怎么样。

"I'd rather not," said Asuka as she started pulling out everything that Shinji had said. Meanwhile, Shinji started the grill outside, battling the elements. The wind had picked up, and getting a fire started took longer than he anticipated. Inside, Asuka had already mixed the vegetables into a separate bowl with the sauce and was stirring it without much purpose.

"我还是算了吧，" 明日香一边说着，一边开始拿出真嗣提到的所有东西。与此同时，真嗣在外面开始生火烧烤，与自然环境作斗争。风势渐起，生火比他预想的要花更长时间。屋内，明日香已经将蔬菜与酱料混合在一个单独的碗里，无目的地搅拌着。

"The fire may take longer to properly heat because of the wind," said Shinji as he stepped into the side door. He was slightly wet from the torrential downpour.

"因为风的关系，火可能需要更长时间才能充分加热，" 真嗣一边说着，一边从侧门走进来。他因为那场倾盆大雨而略显湿漉。

"So what, we wait?" asked Asuka.

"那又怎样，我们等吗？" 明日香问道。

"Pretty much," shrugged Shinji.

"差不多吧，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。

Without many other option, Shinji brought two chairs into the kitchen so he could keep an eye on the fire. At first, he thought about bringing just one in, but Asuka insisted that he bring two, one for her as well. Together, they sat in the midst of the kitchen, watching the fire through the side door.

别无他选之下，真嗣搬了两把椅子进厨房，以便能随时留意火势。起初，他本想只搬一把，但明日香坚持要他搬两把，其中一把给她。于是，两人并肩坐在厨房中央，透过侧门凝视着火焰。

"Hey Shinji," mumbled Asuka after several minutes of silence.

"嘿，真嗣，" 在几分钟的沉默后，明日香咕哝道。

"Hmm?" muttered Shinji. "嗯？" 真嗣嘟囔了一声。

"About what I said earlier-"

"关于我之前说的那些——"

Shinji sincerely hoped she wasn't about to bring up his vision again.

真嗣真诚地希望她不会再次提起他的那个幻象。

"About Christmas," finished Asuka.

"关于圣诞节的事，"明日香补充道。

"Oh, that..."sighed Shinji.

"哦，那个啊..."真嗣叹了口气。

"What?" asked Asuka, her voice raised slightly.

"什么？" 明日香提高了声音问道。

"No, nothing," replied Shinji hurriedly. "So, what about it?"

"不，没什么，" 真嗣急忙回答，"那么，那件事怎么样了？"

"I think I want to do something after all. If nothing else, to alleviate the boredom."

"我想我还是想做点什么。就算没有别的，至少可以缓解一下无聊。"

"Aren't you forgetting that we don't even know what day Christmas is?"

"你是不是忘了，我们连圣诞节是哪天都不知道？"

"Sure we do, its the twenty-fifth."

"当然知道，是二十五号。"

"But that doesn't help if we don't know how many more days until that point we have. We don't even know what today is."

"但如果不清楚还有多少天到那个节点，这也没用。我们甚至不知道今天是哪天。"

"Then in three weeks, its Christmas," said Asuka stubbornly.

"那三周后就是圣诞节了，"明日香固执地说。"

"You aren't letting this go, are you?"

"你是不打算放下这事了，对吧？"

"If I'm going to be bored, miserable, and stuck inside this house for several weeks, I want to at least have some sense of fun."

"如果我注定要在这房子里无聊、痛苦地待上几周，至少得找点乐子。"

"Fine, you win. I give up," sighed Shinji.

"好吧，你赢了。我放弃了，" 真嗣叹息道。

"Good," said Asuka as she leaned back in her chair.

“很好。”明日香说着，靠回椅背上。

They talked idly for a while, until Shinji went outside to check the fire, deeming that it was hot enough. Even after cooking rice over an open flame for so long, Shinji still had to be careful he didn't accidentally burn it. No matter how long it was, he didn't think he'd get used to cooking like this.

他们闲聊了一会儿，直到真嗣出去检查火候，认为已经足够热了。尽管在明火上煮饭已久，真嗣仍需小心不慎烧焦。无论多久，他都不觉得自己能习惯这样的烹饪方式。

After letting the vegetables and rice cook together, Shinji brought the pan off the fire, and walked back into the warmth of the kitchen. The rain was still coming down heavily outside.

在让蔬菜和米饭一起煮了一会儿后，真嗣将锅从火上取下，走回了温暖的厨房。外面的雨依然下得很大。

"I'll take that," said Asuka as she took the pan from Shinji after he walked inside. Slightly surprised by this show of generosity, Shinji blinked twice before shrugging his shoulders, and walked into the living room. Even though the fireplace was in another room, it still provided sufficient light for the entire downstairs; the candles existed as an add-on.

“我来拿吧，”明日香说着从真嗣手中接过锅，他走进屋内后。真嗣对这突如其来的慷慨举动略感惊讶，眨了两下眼，然后耸耸肩，走进了客厅。尽管壁炉在另一个房间，但它仍然为整个楼下提供了足够的光线；蜡烛只是附加的装饰。

After waiting several second, Asuka walked into the room carrying two bowls of rice and vegetables, steam cascading upwards from the bowl.

等待了几秒钟后，明日香端着两碗盛满蔬菜和米饭的碗走进房间，蒸汽从碗中升腾而起。

"Here," said Asuka as she passed him a bowl. Mumbling his thanks, Shinji dove right into the meal, enjoying the rich taste of rice and vegetables. This wasn't the first they had made something like this, and it certainly wouldn't be the last.

“给，”明日香说着递给他一个碗。真嗣含糊地道了声谢，便埋头享用起饭菜来，品味着米饭和蔬菜的浓郁滋味。这已经不是他们第一次做这样的料理了，当然也不会是最后一次。

Finishing first, Shinji set his bowl down beside the couch, and leaned back, closing his eyes as he did. Simple things like this: he wondered, and this was pure speculation, whether him and Asuka had spent moments like this before, if they really had been living in Misato's apartment. He never thought much about that, as Asuka had said it was wise not to dwell on the past. Still, he couldn't help but feel curious about what may have happened before all this.

率先吃完，真嗣将碗放在沙发旁，向后靠去，闭上了眼睛。像这样的简单时刻：他在想，这纯粹是猜测，他和明日香是否曾有过这样的瞬间，如果他们真的曾在美里小姐的公寓里生活过。他从未过多思考这些，因为明日香说过，沉湎于过去是明智的。然而，他还是忍不住对这一切发生之前可能发生的事情感到好奇。

Feeling the couch cushions shifting, Shinji glanced to his right, and saw Asuka had finished her own bowl, and was now sinking further into the couch cushions.

感受到沙发垫的移动，真嗣向右瞥了一眼，只见明日香已经吃完了自己的碗，此刻正更深地陷进沙发垫里。

"There's more if you want you know," said Asuka as she saw him glancing at her.

"如果你想要更多，你知道的，" 明日香看到他瞥向她时说道。

"I'll wrap it up later," said Shinji.

"我稍后会打包，" 真嗣说。

"Hmm, okay," said Asuka. "嗯，好吧，" 明日香说。

Yawning, she attempted to stifle it with her hand, but was unable to. Repositioning herself, she moved her back so that it was now against the arm of the couch, and brought her legs up to her chest. Seconds later though, she apparently found this uncomfortable, because she stretched her legs outward instead. Without enough room for her to stretch out all the way, her legs naturally found themselves resting on Shinji's legs now. Needless to say, Shinji couldn't go without saying something in regard to this.

她打着哈欠，试图用手捂住，却未能成功。她调整了一下姿势，将背部靠在沙发扶手上，然后把双腿蜷缩到胸前。然而几秒钟后，她显然觉得这样不舒服，于是改将双腿伸展开来。由于空间不足，无法完全伸展，她的腿自然而然地搭在了真嗣的腿上。不用说，真嗣对此不可能无动于衷。

"Err, Asuka...?" started Shinji.

“呃，明日香...？”真嗣开口道。

"Don't like it, move then," was all she replied with.

“不喜欢就挪开。”她只回了这么一句。

She glared back at him, as though daring him to move. If he did, then she would win, but it wasn't like he considered it a battle of sorts either.

她瞪回去，仿佛在挑衅他动一下。如果他真的动了，那么她就会赢，但这并不意味着他将其视为某种较量。

"Whatever," grumbled Shinji as he ignored her. Asuka grinned at her victory, and sunk lower into the couch. Shinji was having a more difficult time cooping with having Asuka's legs directly in front of him, and certain thoughts crossed his mind. Most of them would end up with him getting kicked in the jaw, but they were still fun to think of. At that though, he thought of something else.

“随便吧，”真嗣咕哝着，无视了她。明日香得意地笑了，更深地陷进沙发里。真嗣面对明日香的双腿直接摆在面前的情况，感到更加难以应对，某些念头在他脑海中闪过。大多数念头最终都会导致他被踢下巴，但想想还是挺有趣的。想到这里，他又想到了别的事情。

"Asuka, how do you feel about me?" Shinji asked. As he said this, he wasn't entirely sure whether he had meant his thoughts to become spoken. Quickly looking over at Asuka, she didn't give much away in her expression. She was frowning, but it wasn't in annoyance. Rather, it seemed that she was thinking.

"Asuka，你对我有什么感觉？" 真嗣问道。当他这么说时，他并不完全确定自己是否打算将这些想法说出口。他迅速看向 Asuka，她的表情并没有透露太多。她在皱眉，但并非出于恼怒。相反，看起来她正在思考。

"I don't hate you, if thats what you mean Shinji," said Asuka slowly.

"如果你是指这个的话，真嗣，我不讨厌你，" Asuka 缓缓地说道。

"While I appreciate that," said Shinji, "that isn't exactly what I meant."

"虽然我很感激这一点，" 真嗣说，"但这并不是我真正想问的。

There were certain things he could say that would shed light on this situation, but he wasn't about to speak of those things. They had shared, shall we say, certain intimate situations, none of which could be considered wrong considering the situations they had occurred in. Well, almost none, but the last thing Shinji wanted to speak of, was when Asuka had crawled in bed with him scant weeks ago.

有些话他可以说出来，让这情况明朗些，但他并不打算提及那些事。可以说，他们曾共享过某些亲密时刻，考虑到发生时的情境，这些都不算错。嗯，几乎都不算错，但真嗣最不想谈起的，是几周前明日香爬上他床的那次。

"What did you mean then?" asked Asuka.

"你那是什么意思？" 明日香问道。

"Simply that, when you look at me, how do you feel?"

"就是问你，当你看着我时，有什么感觉？"

This time, Asuka did seem like she was annoyed with the question. Swinging her legs around so that they were no longer resting on Shinji's lap, she sat upright and said, "Well, I don't know. There isn't anything particular I feel. I mean, comfortable would be one feeling I could say, but I don't rightfully understand what that means. Other than that, there isn't anything else really. Why do you ask anyway?"

这次，明日香似乎真的对这个提问感到不悦。她把腿从真嗣的膝上移开，坐直了身子，说道："嗯，我不知道。没有什么特别的感觉。我是说，舒适算是一种感觉吧，但我并不真正理解那意味着什么。除此之外，真的没有什么其他的感觉了。你干嘛问这个？"

"Just thinking I guess," shrugged Shinji.

"只是在想些事情吧，大概。" 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"Well, it was a strange thing to be thinking about," replied Asuka. She glanced back at Shinji, trying to gauge his own feelings on the subject.

"嗯，那确实是个奇怪的念头。" 明日香回答道。她回头看了看真嗣，试图揣摩他对这个话题的感受。

"Then can I ask, how do you feel about me then?" asked Asuka, hardly knowing that she was speaking. She almost wished she could take back that sentence.

"那我能问一下，你对我的感觉又是怎样的呢？" 明日香几乎不知道自己在说什么。她几乎希望自己能收回那句话。

"How I feel about you?" repeated Shinji, feeling confused.

"我对你感觉如何？" 真嗣重复道，感到困惑。

"I just told you, so now you have to tell me," retorted Asuka rather hotly.

"我刚刚才告诉你的，所以现在你得告诉我，" 明日香相当激烈地反驳道。

"A friend comes to mind first," muttered Shinji, "the only person I've really ever known to be able to call a friend."

"首先想到的是一个朋友，" 真嗣喃喃自语，"我真正认识并能称之为朋友的唯一一个人。"

"You really led a shitty life before meeting me, didn't you," said Asuka without much humility. Shinji ignored the jab, and continued.

"遇见我之前，你的生活真的很糟糕，不是吗，" 明日香不带多少谦逊地说。真嗣无视了她的讽刺，继续说道。

"Other than that...somebody important to me, and I guess like yourself, I feel comfortable around you Asuka."

"除此之外...对我来说，你是个重要的人，我想和你一样，我在你身边感到很自在，明日香。"

At Shinji's mention of 'somebody important to me' Asuka felt her face heating up, unaware that she had begun to blush.

一听到真嗣提到“对我重要的人”，明日香感到脸颊发烫，却未察觉自己已开始脸红。

"Is that so," said Asuka, trying to ignore the sudden surge in temperature within her own body. Why did he have to say something like that?

"原来如此，" 明日香说道，试图忽视自己体内突然升高的体温。为什么他非得说那种话呢？

"Are you okay Asuka?" asked Shinji, noticing her face had turned unusually red.

"你还好吗，明日香？" 真嗣问道，注意到她的脸变得异常红润。

"Fine, you idiot," grumbled Asuka as she turned away from him to hide her face.

"没事，你这个白痴，" 明日香咕哝着转过身去，不让他看到自己的脸。

Shinji was unsure whether she was truthful in what she said, but he didn't pursue the subject. Standing up, he gathered the two bowls they had eaten out of and left them in the kitchen. As he walked back to the living room, he arrived just in time to see Asuka ascend the first step of the staircase.

真嗣不确定她所说的是否属实，但他没有继续追问。他站起身，收拾了两人用过的两个碗，把它们放在厨房里。当他走回客厅时，正好看到明日香踏上楼梯的第一级台阶。

"Going upstairs already?" asked Shinji.

“已经要上楼了吗？”真嗣问道。

'Because of what you said, I'm having difficulties just looking at you.' Asuka wasn't about to tell him this, even though she was thinking it.

“因为你说的那些话，我现在看着你都很困难。”明日香并不打算告诉他这一点，尽管她心里是这么想的。

"Yeah," shrugged Asuka, not meeting his gaze.

“嗯，”明日香耸了耸肩，没有直视他的目光。

"Alright," said Shinji, as he watched Asuka walk the rest of the way upstairs. After he heard the door of her room close, he let out a low sigh, and ran his hands through his hair. Even he, who said such a thing, was have difficulties with seeing Asuka. He was truthful in what he had said about her being important to him, but still, saying it out loud to the person in question was different.

“好吧，”真嗣说道，看着明日香走上楼梯的其余部分。听到她房间的门关上后，他轻轻叹了口气，双手穿过头发。即使是他，说出那样的话，也难以面对明日香。他确实说过她对他很重要，但当着她的面说出口又是另一回事。

Knowing that he couldn't do anything about it, Shinji walked into the kitchen, and washed the dishes they had used. Afterwards, he grabbed the candle that rested on the dining room table, lit it, and walked down the hallway by the stairs that led to the study. He sometimes spent time in here, usually after Asuka had already gone upstairs for the night.

明知无能为力，真嗣还是走进厨房，清洗了他们用过的餐具。随后，他拿起餐厅桌上摆放的蜡烛，点燃它，沿着通往书房的楼梯过道走去。有时他会在这里度过一些时光，通常是在明日香已经上楼就寝之后。

Leaving the candle on the desk, he walked around it to the bookcase on the opposite wall, pulling out a certain book. Returning to the desk, he sat down in the office chair, and began reading by candlelight. While he read though, his mind worked in two ways. Firstly, he was conscious of what he was reading, and turned the pages idly with each passing page, but secondly, he was also thinking about what him and Asuka had discussed today.

他将蜡烛留在书桌上，绕过桌子走向对面墙边的书架，抽出一本特定的书。回到桌前，他坐在办公椅上，借着烛光开始阅读。然而，在他阅读的同时，他的思绪却以两种方式运转。一方面，他清楚自己在读什么，随着每一页的翻过，他漫不经心地翻页；另一方面，他也在思考今天与明日香讨论的内容。

How could he put it: Christmas was still a forgone thought in his mind. Asuka was happy enough with the thought, but Shinji couldn't share that. Maybe it was because he had never enjoyed a happy Christmas, but it went further than that. Asuka and him, were the only two people on the seemingly empty planet; was celebrating Christmas the right thing to do? Shouldn't they be focusing on more important stuff. Shinji couldn't forget his own problems, and knew that they would increase as the days went on. Judging from the feelings he got within him sometimes, he knew it was only a matter of time until whatever was inside him erupted. Whenever that happened, he didn't want to be celebrating Christmas with Asuka. And still, he didn't mention this worry to her. He claimed that she was important to him, but he couldn't bring this up.

他该如何表达呢：圣诞节在他心中仍是一个遥远的念头。明日香对此感到相当高兴，但真嗣却无法分享这份喜悦。或许是因为他从未享受过一个快乐的圣诞节，但这背后还有更深层次的原因。他和明日香，似乎是这颗空荡星球上仅有的两个人；庆祝圣诞节真的是正确的选择吗？他们不应该专注于更重要的事情吗？真嗣无法忘记自己的烦恼，也知道随着时间的推移，这些问题只会愈演愈烈。从他内心不时涌出的感觉来看，他明白那股潜藏在他体内的力量爆发只是时间问题。无论何时发生，他都不希望那时自己正与明日香一起庆祝圣诞节。尽管如此，他并未向她提及这份担忧。他声称她对他很重要，但他却无法提起这件事。

Closing his book with a snap, Shinji suddenly had a strong urge to fling it across the room. Bursts of anger were never something he had encountered before, so these were entirely new to him. For pointless things such as this, if something were to actually happen, and his anger exploded, what would happen. How would Asuka react?

啪的一声合上书本，真嗣突然有种强烈的冲动想把它扔到房间的另一头。愤怒的爆发对他来说是从未有过的经历，因此这一切对他来说都是全新的体验。对于这种无关紧要的事情，如果真的发生了，他的愤怒爆发了，那会发生什么？明日香会有何反应？

Pushing these thoughts away, Shinji stood up, and placed the book back on the shelf. He stared at the bookcase for several seconds, searching for some answer within him, but was unable to find any. Without anything else to do, Shinji left the study, and walked up the flight of stairs to the second floor. Not even bothering to check on Asuka, Shinji entered his own room and crawled under the sheets, wishing that time could be stuck in a loop, where the past two weeks played endlessly.

将这些思绪抛诸脑后，真嗣站起身，将书放回书架。他盯着书架看了好几秒，试图在内心寻找某种答案，却一无所获。无事可做之下，真嗣离开了书房，走上楼梯来到二楼。甚至懒得去查看明日香的情况，真嗣走进自己的房间，钻进被窝，希望时间能停滞在一个循环中，让过去两周的情景不断重演。

So, obviously were moving into the Christmas season, both in this story, and in the real world. Typically, I do a Christmas story once every two years, and I haven't done one since 2011. Considering the season this story is currently taking place in, I decided to blend the element of Christmas into the story. Basically, I'll be posting a chapter every week in December, leading up to Christmas as I've done in the past. Look forward to that, as I know I will. (Already got the first four pages of the next chapter done, and some interesting things happen within those four pages) Look forward to it all.

显然，我们正步入圣诞季，无论是在这个故事中，还是在现实世界里。通常，我每两年会写一个圣诞故事，而上一次是在 2011 年。考虑到故事当前所处的季节，我决定将圣诞元素融入其中。基本上，我会在十二月每周发布一篇chapter，直至圣诞节，就像我过去所做的那样。敬请期待，因为我自己也很期待。（下一篇chapter的前四页已经完成了，其中发生了一些有趣的事情）敬请期待这一切。

On a completely unrelated side note, White Album 2 is simply amazing. Ah that last episode...

说个完全不相干的事，《白色相簿 2》真是太棒了。啊，那最后一集……

### Chapter 14: Self

Alright, heres the first chapter in this month of updates for the holiday season. I'll talk at the end of this.

好了，这是本月更新中的第一个 chapter，为假期季准备。我会在最后说几句。

---

Very rarely did Shinji ever dream, and even if he did, he never remembered them. This one, was different however. Dreams never made any sense, and typically started in the middle without the dreamer having any knowledge as to how they had gotten there. Some people were able to control their dreams, but this wasn't what Shinji experienced. His dream could have very easily been reality, simply because of how real everything seemed.

真嗣很少做梦，即便做了，他也从不记得。但这一次，情况不同。梦从来都没有逻辑，通常从中间开始，做梦者对如何到达那里一无所知。有些人能控制自己的梦，但这不是真嗣的经历。他的梦很容易被误认为是现实，因为一切都显得如此真实。

He was in the Geofront, but it wasn't as he had seen it. Large chunks of the ground weren't uprooted, the trees weren't burnt to a crisp; it was lush and green: whole. Standing at the waters edge, Shinji could see the entirety of the Geofront. Was this how it had been before Third Impact?

他身处地底都市，但景象与他所见过的截然不同。大块地面并未被掀翻，树木也未被烧焦；这里郁郁葱葱，完好无损。站在水边，真嗣能一览无余地看到整个地底都市。这是否就是第三次冲击前的模样？

Kneeling down, Shinji brought his hands to the water and cupped them, raising the water out of the lake, and letting it trickle between his fingers. As the water began falling back into the lake, Shinji noticed his reflection staring back at him. Staring back, that was probably the proper way to describe it. The reflection he saw of himself, was different. It certainly looked like him, but there was something gruesomely different.

真嗣跪下，双手伸向水面，捧起湖水，任其从指间滴落。当水开始回落湖中时，真嗣注意到自己的倒影正回望着他。回望，或许这样描述最为贴切。他看到的倒影，虽与他相似，却有着某种骇人的不同。

It was very clear. The eyes were not the normal brown of Shinji Ikari, but scarlet, blood red.

这一点非常明显。那双眼睛并非真嗣·碇通常的棕色，而是猩红，血一般的红色。

Surprised by this, Shinji hastily stepped away from the edge, and tripped over his own feet, falling onto the cool sandy shore.

对此感到惊讶，真嗣急忙从边缘退开，却不慎绊倒了自己的脚，跌倒在凉爽的沙滩上。

"I can't believe how cowardly you've become."

“我简直不敢相信你变得如此懦弱。”

Shinji looked up, recognizing the voice of the person speaking. It was his own voice, but it seemed much crueler, almost hateful. As he sat upright, he saw something truly horrifying. Another Shinji Ikari, was stepping out of the lake, dressed in his standard white shirt and black pants. The molecules of water seemed to be repelling off him, almost as though they were somehow afraid of him. His red eyes were staring back into Shinji's own brown eyes, as though looking directly through him.

真嗣抬头一看，认出了说话人的声音。那是他自己的声音，但听起来却异常冷酷，几乎带着恨意。当他坐直身子时，他看到了真正令人恐惧的一幕。另一个碇真嗣正从湖中走出，穿着他那件标准的白衬衫和黑裤子。水分子似乎在排斥他，仿佛它们在某种程度上害怕他。他那双红色的眼睛直视着真嗣的棕色眼睛，仿佛能直接看穿他。

"What-" began Shinji. "什么-" 新治开口道。

"What am I?" replied Shinji, "the other you of course, but you seem to have forgotten. I certainly haven't. Without me, you wouldn't even be here right now."

"我是什么？" 新治回答，"当然是另一个你，不过你似乎忘记了。我可没忘。没有我，你现在根本不会在这里。"

The Shinji with red eyes smirked, taunting Shinji himself. This was the strangest experience ever. Shinji didn't even know where to begin, and was momentarily struck speechless.

红眼的新治冷笑一声，嘲弄着新治本人。这是有史以来最奇怪的经历。新治甚至不知道从何说起，一时间哑口无言。

"Can't talk huh?" said the Shinji with red eyes, clearly reading his mind. "I suppose thats understandable, you've forgotten so much. Granted, since we're the same person, I don't remember much either. Lilith sure didn't leave much to chance."

"不能说话吗？" 红眼瞳的 Shinji 说道，显然读懂了他的心思。"我想这可以理解，你已经忘记了太多。不过，既然我们是同一个人，我也不记得多少。Lilith 确实没留下太多机会。"

Shinji didn't understand the meaning behind the word Lilith, but had to assume it was a person of sorts. Still, this didn't answer what the entity standing before him was. It claimed it was himself, Shinji Ikari, but it was clearly not at the same time.

Shinji 不明白 Lilith 这个词背后的含义，但不得不假设它是一种人。然而，这并没有解释站在他面前的实体是什么。它自称是 Shinji Ikari，但显然又不是。

"Don't be a fool," started the Shinji with red eyes. "Everything you are, I am, and everything I am, you are. We are one in the same; two sides of the same coin."

"别犯傻了，" 红眼瞳的 Shinji 开始说道。"你的一切，我都有，我的一切，你也有。我们是一体的；同一枚硬币的两面。"

"You say that you are me, but I don't believe that," said Shinji, finding his voice.

"你说你是我，但我不相信，" 真嗣找回了自己的声音说道。

"Believe what you will. It doesn't change who we are," said the Shinji with red eyes. "Besides, you don't have much of a choice in the matter. Even you've begun to realize the changes you're undergoing. You can't refute that. After everything that happened since the building collapsed, you're leg healing, and that vision you had, along with the inexplicable feeling of a certain force; you can't ignore what is happening. What has happened before, will happen again. That much is inevitable."

"随你怎么想。这改变不了我们是谁，" 红眼的真嗣说。"再说，你在这件事上也没多少选择余地。就连你自己也开始意识到正在发生的变化。你无法否认这一点。自从大楼倒塌后发生的所有事情，你的腿在愈合，还有你看到的幻象，以及那种难以言喻的力量感；你无法忽视正在发生的事情。过去发生过的事，还会再次发生。这是不可避免的。

"And what happened before?" asked Shinji.

"那之前发生了什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Awakening," replied Shinji. "It was suppressed until now, because you weren't conscious of it. Now that you've become aware of it, the process will speed up."

"觉醒，" 真嗣回答道，"它一直被压抑着，直到现在，因为你没有意识到它。既然你已经意识到了，这个过程将会加速。"

"How do I know you aren't lying about this. How do I know all of this isn't just some crazy dream that happened because I've been stressed out about, well, multiple things."

"我怎么知道你不是在撒谎。我怎么知道这一切不是因为我压力过大，关于很多事情，而产生的某个疯狂的梦境。"

"My existence is enough to know that everything is happening again. You've realized it, but your body has an innate ability to heal itself, nor was this always the case. Still, ever since your leg broke, you've become aware of this fact. It always existed before now, in essence I suppose, but now, because of the severity of the injury, the change has begun again."

我的存在足以知晓一切正在重演。你已意识到这一点，但你的身体拥有自愈的本能，并非始终如此。然而，自你腿骨折后，你便开始察觉到这一事实。它本质上一直存在，我想，但现在，由于伤势的严重性，变化再次开始了。

"I still don't understand what you're talking about," said Shinji, dazed over everything.

"我还是不明白你在说什么，"真嗣茫然地说道。

"No, I don't suppose you would," said the Shinji with red eyes. "Maybe it would be better to show you instead."

"不，我想你也不会明白，"红眼真嗣说道，"也许直接展示给你看会更好。

Turning away, the Shinji with red eyes approached the edge of the water, and stood still for several seconds. In a flash, he raised his arm, and then brought it down like a 18th century guillotine. What could only be described as an eruption of orange appeared in front of him, and cleanly split the lake apart, straight down the middle. Water quickly filled in the gaping hole that was left from the supernatural impact, and the Shinji with red eyes turned away from this show of superhuman power, returning his gaze to Shinji Ikari.

红眼真嗣转身走向水边，静静地站了几秒钟。突然间，他举起手臂，然后像 18 世纪的断头台一样猛地挥下。在他面前，只能用橙色爆发来形容的景象出现了，湖水被干净利落地劈成两半，直直地分隔开来。水迅速填满了超自然冲击留下的巨大裂口，红眼真嗣转身离开这超人般的力量展示，将目光重新投向碇真嗣。

"What you just witnessed, was the release of whats known as an AT-field."

"你刚才所目睹的，是被称为 AT 力场的东西的释放。"

Shinji was dumbstruck by what he had seen, but that word jogged something in his memory. He had heard it somewhere before, but he couldn't place the memory.

真嗣被他所见之景惊得目瞪口呆，但那个词触动了他记忆中的某个角落。他曾在某处听过，却无法准确回忆起那个片段。

"As I'm no doubt aware, you have a multitude of questions for me, but I can't answer them. As I said, we are the same person, so we both lack any memory from what happened during those four months in Tokyo-3."

"我无疑知道，你心中有许多问题想问我，但我无法回答。如我所说，我们本质上是同一个人，因此我们都缺失了在东京-3 那四个月期间发生的记忆。"

"But you can still use this," said Shinji, referring to the AT-field. "You must have some semblance of what you are."

“但你仍可以利用这个，”真嗣说道，指的是 AT 力场。“你必定对自己有所了解。”

"I'm you. Thats who I am. I am the you that has this ability. Why, our how I obtained it, that I have no idea. I have no trouble controlling it, and it feels second nature to use it. As you thought before, almost like an extension of oneself. That doesn't seem to be far from the truth."

"我就是你。这就是我的身份。我是拥有这种能力的你。为什么或如何获得它，我毫无头绪。控制它毫无困难，使用它感觉就像第二天性。正如你之前所想，几乎像是自己的延伸。这似乎并不远离真相。"

"Then, this...I have this, AT-field thing?"

"那么，这个...我有这个，AT 力场吗？"

"Yes," said the Shinji with red eyes, frustration apparent on his face.

"是的，"红眼版的真嗣说道，脸上明显带着沮丧。

"And the red eyes?" "还有那双红眼睛呢？"

"Red eyes?" "红眼睛？"

"You never noticed?" "你从未注意到吗？"

"No, I didn't," mumbled the Shinji with red eyes. He was not used to being puzzled, and something of this nature was unheard of. They were the same person, but fundamentally different at the same time.

"不，我没有，" 红着眼睛的真嗣咕哝道。他不习惯被困惑，这种性质的事情闻所未闻。他们是同一个人，但同时又从根本上不同。

"I don't know. Thats something you'd have to find out yourself."

"我不知道。那得你自己去弄清楚。"

As he said this, the world around Shinji Ikari began to go dark. Shadows creeped up on the far side of the lake and began rushing towards them. Everything was being swallowed up by the darkness. Was it ending, whatever this was?

当他说出这话时，碇真嗣周围的世界开始变得昏暗。阴影从湖的远端悄悄蔓延，并开始向他们急速逼近。一切都被黑暗吞噬。这是要结束了吗，无论这是什么？

"Looks like your dream is shifting," said the Shinji with red eyes.

“看来你的梦境正在转变，”红眼版的真嗣说道。

"So then this was a dream?" asked Shinji, "and none of this was actually real?"

“那么这一切都是梦吗？”真嗣问道，“这一切都不是真实的？”

"Whether this world is real or not doesn't matter. What I said is true. Everything else I leave to you to find out.

“这个世界是否真实并不重要。我所说的是真的。其他的，留给你自己去发现。”

The darkness passed over their side of the lake, and begun to absorb the Shinji with red eyes.

黑暗笼罩了湖的他们那一侧，并开始吸收那些红眼的真嗣。

"One last thing," he said as the darkness slowly engulfed him. "Don't hesitate about talking to Asuka so much. She's stubborn to a fault, but clearly cares about you, even if she doesn't show it. Don't bottle these things up. Understanding may be the first step afterall."

"还有一件事，"他在黑暗缓缓吞噬他之际说道，"别再犹豫是否该和明日香多聊聊了。她固执得要命，但显然很在乎你，即便她不表现出来。别把这些事憋在心里。理解毕竟才是第一步。"

Without giving Shinji any chance to talk further, the other Shinji disappeared into the darkness of the dream. At the same time, Shinji awoke in the real world.

没给真嗣任何继续交谈的机会，另一个真嗣便消失在了梦境的黑暗中。与此同时，真嗣在现实世界中醒了过来。

Far from the location of Asuka and Shinji, something returned to somebody. Raising her head, the white entity observed the object that had returned. It was wise for her to implement this as a precaution. She could never do anything about the boys origins, but she may be able to change his course. It was partially her fault to begin with afterall. Memory was a precious thing.

远离明日香和真嗣所在之处，某物归于某人。白色实体抬起头，注视着归来的物体。她采取此举作为预防措施是明智的。她无法改变那男孩的出身，但或许能改变他的轨迹。毕竟，这问题部分源于她自身。记忆是珍贵之物。

With that out of the way, she returned to her work, concentrating on the sphere in front of her. Only two months had passed since they had departed; how much longer would it take? Months, years, decades? She hoped not. A promise was a promise though, so she would wait for as long as it took the two of them.

解决了这个插曲后，她重新投入到工作中，专注于面前的球体。他们离开不过两个月；还需要多久呢？几个月，几年，甚至几十年？她希望不会那么久。但承诺就是承诺，无论多久，她都会等待他们归来。

That dream, no mater how much Shinji thought about it, he couldn't come to terms with what he had witnessed. Was what happened real, and was what his other self said true?

那个梦，无论真嗣怎么思考，他都无法接受自己所目睹的一切。发生的事情是真的吗，另一个自己说的话又是真的吗？

When Shinji had awaken, it was in fit of confusion. The blankets were wrapped around him, and he had broken out in a cold sweat sometime during the night. He had tossed the sheets off himself, left his bedroom, and was now sitting down in the living room. He relit the fire, which had died out during the night, but he didn't know what time it currently was. He'd already tried going to sleep on the couch, but that had failed. So now, he was just wasting away the remaining hours until the sun rose. It wasn't ideal, but he was so wide awake now, that he couldn't sit still.

当真嗣醒来时，他正处于一片混乱之中。毯子紧紧裹在身上，夜里不知何时出了一身冷汗。他掀开被子，离开卧室，此刻正坐在客厅里。他重新点燃了夜间熄灭的火堆，却不知现在是什么时间。他尝试在沙发上入睡，但未能成功。于是，他只能消磨剩余的时光，等待日出。这并非理想状态，但他现在异常清醒，根本无法静坐。

That dreamed seemed so real, and unlike most dreams, it wasn't fading away. Every moment of it, Shinji still retained. The smell of the air, the feel of the water as it passed between his fingers; all of these seemed so real as if he had actually experienced them in the real world. Then there was this thing, the AT-field that his other self had mentioned. After thinking about it, he recalled where he had heard it from. Back on the beach of Tokyo-3, when Asuka had been explaining everything about Nerv, the Angels, and the Evangelions, she had briefly touched on the subject of the AT-field, but hadn't gone into great depths about it. How was it that Shinji had this thing within him? Both the Evangelions and Angels had this, so what did that make him?

那个梦境如此真实，与大多数梦境不同，它并未消散。碇真嗣依然记得每一个瞬间。空气的味道，水流过指间的感觉；这一切都如此真实，仿佛他在现实世界中亲身经历过。然后是这个东西，另一个自己提到的 AT 力场。思考过后，他记起曾在哪里听过。在第三新东京市的沙滩上，当明日香解释关于 NERV、使徒和 EVA 的一切时，她曾简略提及 AT 力场，但并未深入探讨。为什么碇真嗣体内会有这种东西？EVA 和使徒都有 AT 力场，那他算什么？

Other than that, the word Lilith had been spoken, and Shinji was positive he had never heard this before. But whoever it was, seemed to mean something to him somehow. Again, he was piecing things together as best he could, with what little information he had obtained.

除此之外，“莉莉丝”这个词被提到了，碇真嗣确信自己从未听过这个名字。但无论对方是谁，似乎对他有着某种意义。他再次尽力拼凑所知的信息，尽管所获甚少。

The last words of his other self, he was having trouble getting them out of his head. The mention of Asuka had come so casually, that Shinji hadn't been given time to ask his other self about it. He didn't want to involve Asuka with any of this if possible, but he now realized how foolish that thought was. As long as they were together, they would share in both happiness, sadness, and hurt. These were all just a byproduct of living together, and whatever was happening to Shinji, would directly affect Asuka as well. From what Shinji had seen so far, Asuka was understanding with regards to his situation, and he was grateful for that. She didn't shun him, fear him, or treat him like some sort of monster. She acted the same around him no matter what, and Shinji hoped that with this new development, things would be no different. Still, he first had to explain things to her.

他另一个自我的最后一句话，让他难以从脑海中抹去。提到明日香时那般随意，以至于真嗣还没来得及向另一个自己询问。如果可能的话，他不想让明日香卷入这一切，但现在他意识到这个想法多么愚蠢。只要他们在一起，就会共享快乐、悲伤和痛苦。这些都是共同生活的副产品，无论真嗣经历什么，都会直接影响到明日香。从目前所见，明日香对他的处境表现出了理解，这让他感激不尽。她没有回避他，害怕他，或把他当作怪物对待。无论何时，她在真嗣身边都表现得一如既往，真嗣希望随着这一新进展，情况不会有所改变。不过，他首先得向她解释清楚。

When he thought about what he had been told in the dream, it made sense, even if it was unbelievable. His AT-field, he was certain that he could feel it now. Before, he had a very loose grasp on it, almost a transparent like feel; now it seemed like a real object almost. He had briefly toyed with the idea of attempting to project it, just as his other self had done, but decided that he would wait on that. It was wise not to hurry these things; that road was best taken lightly. What Shinji had learned though, it couldn't be called pleasant, knowing that he was fundamentally different from any normal human being, and this weighed heavily on his mind. Now, at least he wasn't worried about who he was. He had finally gotten an answer, even if it wasn't one he had expected.

当他回想起梦中被告知的事情时，尽管难以置信，却也觉得合情合理。他的 AT 力场，他确信现在能感受到它的存在。以前，他对它的掌握非常松散，几乎像是一种透明的感觉；现在它似乎成了一个实实在在的物体。他曾短暂地考虑过尝试投影它，就像他的另一个自我所做的那样，但决定还是等等再说。急于求成并非明智之举；这条路最好轻装上阵。然而，碇真嗣所学到的，却不能称之为愉快，知道自己在根本上与任何普通人不同，这让他心情沉重。现在，至少他不再担心自己是谁。他终于得到了一个答案，尽管不是他所期待的。

Glancing towards the window from where he sat, signs of the sun beginning to rise were imminent, as a warm, yellowish glow, began to appear on the horizon.

他从坐的地方瞥向窗外，太阳即将升起的迹象已经显现，地平线上开始出现温暖的黄橙色光芒。

Shinji ate breakfast early that morning, shortly after the sun had risen, and fell asleep after, waiting for Asuka to come downstairs. He was unsure what time it occurred at, but at some point during the morning, Asuka found him sleeping on the couch, and promptly shook him awake.

那天清晨，太阳刚升起不久，真嗣早早吃了早餐，随后便在沙发上打盹，等待明日香下楼。他不清楚具体时间，但在上午的某个时刻，明日香发现他在沙发上睡着了，便立刻摇醒了他。

"What are you doing sleeping down here?" asked Asuka, still apparently half asleep herself. Her hair was a disheveled mess, and the white shirt she was wearing was far too large for her growing body.

“你在这儿睡觉干嘛？”明日香问道，显然自己也还半梦半醒。她的头发凌乱不堪，身上那件白色衬衫对于她日渐成长的身躯来说过于宽大了。

"I had difficulties sleeping last night," shrugged Shinji as he sat up.

"昨晚我睡得不太好，"真嗣耸了耸肩，坐起身来。

Asuka didn't bother asking what these were, and instead turned her thoughts towards breakfast. With her complaining voice trailing after him, Shinji left the living room, and entered the kitchen, making Asuka's breakfast, as well as making another cup of coffee for himself. While Shinji made her breakfast, Asuka started talking about something, of which he really wasn't paying any attention to. His mind was still filled with that dream he had had.

明日香懒得问这些是什么，转而思考起早餐来。伴随着她抱怨的声音，真嗣离开了客厅，走进厨房，为明日香准备早餐，同时也为自己再冲了一杯咖啡。在真嗣为她做早餐时，明日香开始说起什么，但他其实并没有在听。他的脑海中依然充斥着那个梦。

"Oi, Shinji!? Are you listening to me?"

“喂，真嗣！？你在听我说话吗？”

A sharp impact struck the back of Shinji's head, and he spun around to see Asuka standing behind him, her eyes sparking with annoyance. She had been sitting at the kitchen table, but at some point in the past few seconds, she had clearly moved.

真嗣的后脑勺突然受到重重一击，他转过身来，看到明日香站在他身后，眼中闪烁着怒火。她原本坐在厨房的桌子旁，但在过去的几秒钟内，她显然已经移动了位置。

"Sorry...what? I wasn't paying attention," mumbled Shinji, rubbing the back of his head.

"对不起...什么？我没注意听，" 真嗣咕哝着，揉了揉后脑勺。

"That was clear enough," said Asuka, crossing her arms. "I was saying that we should go up into the attic today, and see if there's any Christmas stuff."

"这已经够清楚了，" 明日香交叉双臂说道。"我是说我们应该今天上阁楼去，看看有没有圣诞节的东西。"

Shinji had forgotten about Asuka's insistence yesterday that they had to celebrate Christmas. That thought couldn't be farther from his mind right now.

真嗣已经忘记了昨天明日香坚持要庆祝圣诞节的事。此刻，这个念头离他的思绪远得不能再远。

"Today?" replied Shinji. "Don't we still have a long while until then. You did say three weeks after all."

“今天？” 真嗣回答道，“我们不是还有很长时间吗？你确实说过是三周后啊。”

"Yeah, well, I want to put some decorations up."

“是啊，我想挂些装饰品。”

"Why? Nobody is going to see them except us. And if you expect to go out and find a tree, then-"

“为什么？除了我们没人会看到。如果你指望出去找棵树，那——”

"Even I know when its a hopeless cause. Besides, this can occupy us for the day at least."

“连我都知道那是无望的。再说了，这至少能让我们忙活一天。”

While Shinji couldn't deny it would do just that, he had more pressing matters to attend to today.

尽管真嗣无法否认这一点，但他今天有更紧迫的事情要处理。

"Do you think they'll actually have anything up there?" asked Shinji. They, referring to the houses previous residents.

“你觉得他们真的会在上面留下什么吗？”真嗣问道。他们，指的是房子之前的住户。

"If they didn't, I'd have to question them as parents. They had two young daughters after all, so Christmas was a grand occasion for them. Hopefully they'll even have an artificial Christmas tree waiting for us."

“如果他们没有，我得质疑他们作为父母的责任了。毕竟他们有两个年幼的女儿，圣诞节对他们来说是个盛大的节日。希望他们甚至会为我们准备一棵人造圣诞树。”

Shinji rarely saw Asuka so excited about something, and it was certainly unlike her, beaming from ear to ear. Seeing this side of her, wasn't bad Shinji had to admit.

真嗣很少见到明日香对某件事如此兴奋，这确实不像她，笑得合不拢嘴。看到她的这一面，真嗣不得不承认，感觉并不坏。

"After breakfast, I'll help," said Shinji.

“吃完早餐后，我来帮忙，”真嗣说。

"Like you ever had a choice," said Asuka as she elbowed him gently in the back. Shinji couldn't help but smile in spite of himself, laughing at how happy Asuka could be over something so simple. This made him want to hold back on what he had to say. Right now would only ruin the mood. Later tonight, maybe, but not right now.

“好像你有选择似的，”明日香一边说，一边轻轻用肘部顶了顶他的背。真嗣忍不住笑了，尽管他自己也不想笑，但看到明日香因为这么简单的事情而如此开心，他感到很高兴。这让他想推迟说出他必须说的话。现在说只会破坏气氛。也许今晚再说，但不是现在。

After Asuka finished eating, she dragged Shinji down into the garage. The garage was empty, so whatever car the family had before, was out somewhere when Third Impact had happened. The garage itself, they hardly entered, and Shinji had only been in here twice since they had begun living there. The space was large enough for two cars to be parked, one in front of the other. It was more or less a single, large room. The hatch to the attic was at the far back wall, only accessible by a ladder. Thankfully, one of these was propped against the wall near the back wall, and they used this to climb up. Shinji had expected himself to be forced up first, but Asuka took the lead, with one of the flashlights in hand, crawling through the small opening.

在明日香吃完饭后，她拽着真嗣来到了车库。车库空空如也，看来在第三次冲击发生时，家里的车不知去了哪里。他们很少进入车库，自搬到这里以来，真嗣只进来过两次。这个空间足够停放两辆车，一前一后。基本上就是一个大房间。通往阁楼的舱门位于远端的墙上，只能通过梯子进入。幸运的是，一架梯子靠在后墙边，他们便利用它爬了上去。真嗣本以为自己会被先推上去，但明日香却率先行动，手持一支手电筒，匍匐着穿过狭小的入口。

"How is it up there?" Shinji called upwards.

“上面怎么样？” 真嗣向上喊道。

"Dark and dusty," was all Asuka replied.

"昏暗且布满灰尘，" 明日香只回答了这一句。

"Do you see anything?" "你看到什么了吗？"

"Give me a second will you. I'm just trying not to sneeze right now."

"给我点时间行不行。我现在正努力忍住不打喷嚏呢。"

Not having much choice, Shinji leaned against a nearby wall, watching the beam of light bouncing around in the attic above him. Once, Asuka did end up sneezing, and Shinji had to prevent himself from laughing at the surprising sound that escaped her mouth. He even suspected she was angry at him for hearing it.

别无选择之下，真嗣靠在附近的墙上，注视着阁楼上光线四处跳跃。有一次，明日香真的打了个喷嚏，真嗣不得不强忍住笑意，因为她发出的意外声响。他甚至怀疑她会因为被他听到而生气。

Ten minutes later, he heard Asuka calling for him.

十分钟后，他听到明日香在叫他。

"Well, I found some stuff," said Asuka, as she poked her head out from the attic.

“嗯，我找到了一些东西。”明日香说着，从阁楼探出头来。

"Anything useful?" asked Shinji.

"有什么有用的吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Not sure. You tell me."

"不确定。你告诉我吧。"

Without giving him any heads up, Asuka dropped a large, cardboard box directly above Shinji. Barely reaching his arms out to catch it, Shinji nearly dropped it, surprised at how heavy it was. Were there ceramic objects in there?

未给任何提示，明日香突然将一个巨大的纸板箱直接丢向真嗣。真嗣勉强伸出双臂接住，差点失手，惊讶于箱子竟如此沉重。里面装的是陶瓷物品吗？

"There's a couple more I'm dropping down," grinned Asuka.

“还有几件要放下来，”明日香咧嘴笑道。

"Could you give me more time to prepare myself if the next are as heavy as this one."

"如果下一箱也这么重，能多给我点时间准备吗？"

"Quit complaining. At least you aren't covered in dust up here." Shinji didn't say it, but he almost wished there places had been swapped.

"别抱怨了。至少你在这儿没被灰尘弄得满身都是。" 真嗣没说出口，但他几乎希望两人的位置能互换。

Asuka dropped four more boxes down to Shinji, making it a total of five boxes filled with Christmas stuff. Each box had 'Christmas' plastered on the side of it, so it wasn't difficult for Asuka knowing what was what when she had been digging through the attic. Leaving the attic, she closed the hatch and climbed down the ladder, where Shinji was already going through the different boxes.

明日香又扔了四个箱子给真嗣，总共是五个装满圣诞物品的箱子。每个箱子侧面都贴着大大的'圣诞节'标签，所以明日香在阁楼里翻找时很容易辨认。她离开阁楼，关上活板门，顺着梯子爬下来，真嗣已经在检查不同的箱子了。

"No tree then?" asked Shinji.

"没有树吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Do you see one packed away in there?" replied Asuka sarcastically. She hadn't had much hope that she would find an artificial one up there, and had even combed the narrow space over multiple times.

"你看到里面有打包好的树吗？" 明日香讽刺地回答。她本来就没抱太大希望能在那里找到人造树，甚至多次仔细搜查了那个狭窄的空间。

"So, what have you found?" asked Asuka.

"那么，你找到了什么？" 明日香问道。

"Well, this one is filled entirely with lights...which doesn't help us very much." Shinji said this as he opened the lid to a single box. It was filled with lights, varying from the classic blue, red, and green, to the plain white ones.

"嗯，这个箱子里全是灯……这对我们没什么帮助。" 真嗣说着打开了一个箱子的盖子。里面装满了各种颜色的灯，从经典的蓝、红、绿到普通的白色灯都有。

"I hadn't thought about that, but lights don't really serve us any purpose," said Asuka, tilting her head as she glanced at the box. "What else then?"

"我倒没想过这个，但灯确实对我们没什么用处，" 明日香歪着头瞥了一眼箱子说，"那还有什么别的吗？"

"An old wreath, a bunch of different silk ornaments, several ornaments that look to be geared towards children, two hanging snow globes, and this is only in the first box. I haven't looked through the others yet."

"一个旧花环，一堆不同款式的丝绸装饰品，几个看起来像是给孩子准备的装饰品，两个悬挂的雪球，这只是第一个箱子里的东西。我还没检查其他箱子。"

"Get started then," said Asuka as she began to stand up.

“那就开始吧。”明日香说着，开始站起身来。

"What are you going to do?" asked Shinji, surprised that she wasn't going to be helping him look through the different boxes. Asuka could be incredibly unhelpful at times, but this was something that she insisted upon, so seeing her uncaring like this was completely opposite of how she had been acting early.

"你要做什么？" 真嗣惊讶地问，没想到她不打算帮忙翻看那些不同的箱子。有时明日香非常不帮忙，但这是她坚持的事情，看到她这样漠不关心，与她早先的行为完全相反。

"Aren't you forgetting something?" asked Asuka. "What use is any of these ornaments and decorations if we don't have a tree."

"你是不是忘了什么？" 明日香问道。"如果我们没有树，这些装饰品和装饰物有什么用呢？"

"...I suppose you have a point," mumbled Shinji. "But what do you plan to do?"

“……我想你说得有道理，”真嗣咕哝道，“但你打算怎么做？”

"See if any of the other houses in the neighborhood have one."

"看看附近其他房子里有没有。"

It only took this single sentence for Shinji to recall the events of yesterday. He didn't want to see anything like that ever again, and whether Asuka liked it or not, he was going to put his foot down in regards to this. Call him paranoid or whatever, but he wasn't going to risk something like that happening, whether it seemed plausible or not.

仅仅这一句话就让真嗣回想起了昨天的事情。他再也不想看到那样的情景，不管明日香是否喜欢，他都决定在这件事上坚持己见。称他为偏执狂也好，什么都行，但他绝不会冒险让那种事情再次发生，无论看起来是否合理。

"And if you intend on stopping me, I'll kick you so hard, you won't be able to move for the rest of the day."

"如果你打算阻止我，我会踢得你一整天都动弹不得。"

Shinji didn't expect Asuka to fight back, and it showed on his face. Upon seeing this, Asuka let out a low sigh and said, "Shinji, I'm just walking from house to house, searching for an artificial tree. What could happen?"

真嗣没想到明日香会反击，这一点在他脸上表露无遗。看到这一幕，明日香低声叹了口气，说道：“真嗣，我只是挨家挨户地找一棵人造树。能发生什么事呢？”

Shinji bit his lips, trying desperately to think about something that could happen, but admittedly, coming up with nothing.

真嗣咬着嘴唇，拼命地想可能会发生什么事情，但坦白说，什么也没想出来。

"I still don't like it," replied Shinji.

“我还是不喜欢这样，”真嗣回答道。

"Huh?" stammered Asuka. "啊？" 明日香结巴道。

"If you won't stay, then I'm coming as well."

"如果你不留下，那我也一起去。"

"One person is enough," replied Asuka.

"一个人就够了," 明日香回答道。

"Do you honestly think you could carry a tree, artificial or not by yourself?"

"你真的以为你能独自扛着一棵树，不管是人造的还是真的？"

It was Asuka's turn to bite her lips; Shinji was right, she hadn't thought about that.

轮到明日香咬唇了；真嗣说得没错，她确实没考虑到这一点。

"You're being stubborn," she grumbled.

"你真是固执," 她咕哝道。

"Like you're one to talk," replied Shinji equally annoyed.

"说得好像你不是一样," 真嗣同样不悦地回敬道。

Asuka rounded on him, feeling suddenly angry at him. It had been a while since she had been this angry at Shinji. Now days, their arguments weren't meaningful, and honestly, more playful than anything. Annoyance was one thing, but Asuka felt legitimately angry at Shinji right now. She could take care of herself. She had been an Evangelion pilot after all, and while that was behind her now, it still helped to make her who she was today.

明日香突然转向他，感到一阵愤怒涌上心头。她已经很久没有对真嗣这么生气了。如今，他们的争吵已不再有意义，坦白说，更多的是嬉闹而非真怒。恼怒是一回事，但明日香此刻对真嗣的愤怒是真切的。她能照顾好自己。毕竟她曾是 EVA 驾驶员，尽管那已成为过去，但这依然塑造了今天的她。

"Just because you saw one bad thing happen to me, doesn't mean you have to suddenly turn into an overprotective parent!"

"就因为你看到我遭遇了一次不幸，并不意味着你得突然变成过度保护的父母！"

"It's because I saw that one bad thing, that I don't want anything like that to become real!" Shinji felt his anger flare up as well, unaware that he was on the verge of shouting. He had to control his emotions better. If he acted solely on them...

"正是因为我目睹了那次不幸，我才不希望类似的事情再次成真！" 真嗣感到自己的怒火也在升腾，没意识到自己差点就要大喊出来。他必须更好地控制自己的情绪。如果他只凭情绪行事...

"Stop looking after me so much!" shouted Asuka. "I can take care of myself!"

"别再这么盯着我了！" 明日香喊道。"我能照顾好自己！"

"Does it annoy you that I do this!? Would it be better if I just ignored you instead!?" Shinji shouted back at her.

"我这样做让你很烦吗！？如果我干脆不理你，会不会更好！？" 真嗣对她大喊回去。

'No, calm down,' he told himself. 'Shouting at each other like this won't help anything.'

'不，冷静下来，' 他对自己说。'这样互相大喊大叫解决不了任何问题。'

"Maybe it would!" yelled Asuka.

"也许会！" 明日香喊道。

They were inches away from each other, their faces bright red with anger, and yelling at each other. But Shinji found himself losing his anger as though it had evaporated. Really, petty fighting like this, wasn't going to get them anywhere. Was he acting like an overprotective parent? Well, maybe a little. But if Asuka had seen what he had seen...describing it just didn't have the same impact as actually viewing it. No matter what, he couldn't let a reality like that happen. But he didn't want to fight against Asuka either. He had hoped that they had gotten passed that point in their lives.

他们之间仅隔几英寸，脸因愤怒而涨得通红，互相大声争吵。但真嗣发现自己怒气渐消，仿佛蒸发了一般。真的，这种小打小闹，不会让他们有任何进展。他是不是表现得像个过度保护的父母？嗯，也许有一点。但如果明日香看到了他所见到的……描述起来远没有亲眼所见那么震撼。无论如何，他不能让那样的现实发生。但他也不想与明日香对抗。他曾希望他们已经度过了生活中的那个阶段。

"What are we doing?" sighed Shinji rather meekly. This was not the retaliation that Asuka had expected, and she was surprised when Shinji sank onto a nearby box, not caring what the contents inside were.

“我们在做什么？”真嗣叹息道，语气颇为软弱。这不是明日香预料中的反击，当真嗣不介意箱子里装的是什么，一屁股坐下时，她感到惊讶。

"What did you say?" asked Asuka.

“你说什么？”明日香问道。

"This fighting," gestured Shinji, "it's stupid."

"这种打架，" 伸治比划着说，"真是愚蠢。"

"You started it," said Asuka, anger still apparent on her face. "If you hadn't said anything, it would have been fine."

"是你先挑起的，" 明日香说道，脸上的怒气依然明显。"如果你没说什么，本来就没事。"

"Well, I did, and its still how I feel. Whether I'm being overprotective or not...well, I don't want what I saw to actually happen. I don't know if something like that, those visions could happen anytime you may be hurt, or if its entirely random. Either way, I don't want to take the risk. I said it yesterday Asuka, but I do consider you important to me...so...well-"

"好吧，我是说了，而且我还是这么觉得。不管我是不是过于保护……嗯，我不希望我看到的真的发生。我不知道那样的幻象会不会在你受伤时随时出现，还是完全随机的。无论如何，我不想冒险。我昨天说过了，明日香，我真的认为你对我很重要……所以……嗯……"

"Okay, stop there!" “好了，停在那儿！”

"Eh?" “诶？”

Asuka had crouched in front of Shinji and slapped him gently on both cheeks.

明日香蹲在真嗣面前，轻轻地拍了拍他的双颊。

"What was that for?" asked Shinji.

"你笑什么？" 真嗣问道。

"For saying something dumb of course," grumbled Asuka as she walked away from him with her back turned; she was feeling slightly embarrassed. She had forgotten about what Shinji had said yesterday, but was now reminded of it.

"当然是因为说了蠢话。" 明日香咕哝着，背对着他走开，感到一丝尴尬。她已经忘记了昨天真嗣说的话，但现在又被提醒了。

"And, I guess, I was being insensitive to you," continued Asuka. "When you saw...my death, I didn't know how strong an impact it would have on you. Maybe I just don't want to think about, 'what if,' at all. If I'm alive though, because of you Shinji, I guess I owe you."

“我想，我那时对你太不敏感了，”明日香继续说道，“当你看到……我的死亡时，我不知道那对你会有多大的冲击。也许我只是不想去考虑那些‘如果’。但如果我还活着，是因为你，碇真嗣，我想我欠你一份情。”

"I don't think you owe me anything Asuka. We look after each other, which is only natural, and you've been kind towards my...circumstances. I don't think I've ever said how glad I am that you don't treat me any different since discovering my uniqueness."

"我认为你并不欠我什么，明日香。我们互相照顾是理所当然的，而且你对我...的处境一直很友善。我想我从没说过，自从你发现我的独特之处后，你没有因此对我另眼相看，我有多么高兴。"

"You're still the same boring Shinji. That much hasn't changed."

"你还是那个无聊的真嗣。这一点没变。"

'How much longer will I stay that way? Will I change into something unrecognizable?'

'我还要这样多久？我会变成一个无法辨认的样子吗？'

Though Shinji thought this, he didn't voice his worries out loud. There was still a lot he had to explain to Asuka.

尽管真嗣心里这么想，但他并没有将担忧说出口。他还有许多事情需要向明日香解释。

"So then, we're okay?" asked Shinji.

“那么，我们没事了？”真嗣问道。

"Fine," nodded Asuka. "Now whether you're coming with me or not, I'm walking next door."

“没事了，”明日香点头道，“不管你跟不跟我来，我都要去隔壁了。”

"Yeah I'm coming. Besides, you still need help moving the tree back here when the time comes."

"好的，我来了。再说，到时候你还需要帮忙把树搬回来呢。"

"I'm sure I could handle it myself if I just took time."

"我相信如果我花点时间，自己也能搞定。"

With their anger forgotten, they walked back into the house, and changed into warmer clothes before walking outside, and braving the elements.

他们忘记了愤怒，走回屋里，换上更暖和的衣服，然后走出户外，勇敢面对恶劣天气。

It was now well into the afternoon, and the two of them had just returned to their house, with an artificial tree in tow. It was lucky that Shinji had accompanied Asuka, because she wouldn't have been able to get the tree out from where it was.

如今已是午后时分，两人刚带着一棵人造树回到了家中。幸好真嗣陪着明日香，否则她根本无法将那棵树从原处搬出来。

In the two weeks since they had begun living in this neighborhood, and more importantly their house, not only had they hardly ventured out, but neither did they visit other houses. Everything they needed was within their grasp at their own place, so visiting the other houses never held much purpose. In fact, the only time they had been in other houses was when Asuka had initially searched for one with a fireplace, and Shinji hadn't even been in any before. Because of this, Asuka decided to search the houses that she had already visited. The first, being the one that seemed to be that of an older married couple, held the most promise in Asuka's opinion. At a certain age, going out and felling a tree, or simply buying one became too tedious, and an artificial one became the more practical solution. Still, after searching both the attic and basement, they weren't able to find a tree. They did find some Christmas ornaments, that seemed rather old and likely been in the family for a couple generations, so they set these aside incase they wanted them later.

自从两周前搬进这个社区，更确切地说，是他们的房子以来，他们不仅几乎未曾外出，也没有拜访过其他住户。他们所需的一切都能在自己家中轻易获取，因此拜访其他房子从未显得有多重要。事实上，他们唯一一次进入其他房子是在 Asuka 最初寻找带壁炉的房子时，而 Shinji 甚至在此之前从未进过任何别人的家。正因如此，Asuka 决定重新探访她已经去过的那些房子。第一间，看起来像是老夫妇的住所，在 Asuka 看来最有希望。到了一定年纪，外出砍树或简单地购买一棵树变得过于繁琐，人造树便成了更实际的选择。然而，尽管搜遍了阁楼和地下室，他们仍未能找到一棵树。不过，他们倒是发现了一些圣诞装饰品，这些装饰品看起来相当陈旧，可能已经在家族中传承了几代，于是他们把这些装饰品放在一旁，以备日后需要。

After this first house, they continued down the block, running from door to door in avoiding the rain, but without much luck in either basements or attics. The neighborhood was largely filled with families that had children around, or younger than Shinji and Asuka's age. Considering that most families would prefer getting an actual tree when they had children, they were starting to lose hope in finding a fake one. Asuka was even beginning to think they should just forget the whole thing, when Shinji called out to her.

在这第一户人家之后，他们继续沿着街区前行，穿梭于各家门前以躲避雨水，但在地下室或阁楼中却未能如愿。这一带多为有小孩的家庭，或是比真嗣和明日香年纪更小的孩子。考虑到大多数家庭在孩子出生后更倾向于购置真树，他们开始对找到假树失去希望。明日香甚至开始觉得他们应该放弃整个计划，就在这时，真嗣向她喊了一声。

They were in the basement of a certain house, one which had been occupied by an older couple. The house itself was only one floor, excluding the basement which was little more than a small crawl space, and only accessible by a very steep set of steps; you had to nearly crouch down to walk through it. Concrete walls surrounded them, with pillars of wood acting as the support beams for the floor above them. A wide assortment of junk from scrap metal, strips of wooden planks, rusted tools, and a mini freezer that had long been abandoned, filled the space. Tucked into a smaller corner though, was an artificial tree that Shinji had found, covered in dust, apparently not used for several years.

他们身处某栋房子的地下室，这房子曾住着一对老夫妇。房子本身只有一层，不包括这个狭小的地下室，它更像是个小爬行空间，只能通过一组非常陡峭的楼梯进入；你必须几乎蹲下才能在其中行走。混凝土墙环绕四周，木柱作为支撑上方楼层的主梁。空间里堆满了各式各样的废品：废金属、木板条、锈迹斑斑的工具，还有早已被遗弃的小型冰箱。然而，在一个更小的角落里，有一棵由真嗣找到的人造树，积满灰尘，显然已有多年未被使用。

He pointed this out to Asuka, and they both picked up each end of the tree, and hauled it up the steep stairs. If Asuka had been by herself, she would have likely been unable to carry it, as it was heavy enough by itself, but combined with the stairs which were little better than a ladder, it would have been almost impossible. After they brought it to the front door, Asuka rushed back to their own house, and drove the car down several houses and parked alongside the curb. The tree barely fit in the back hatch of their station wagon, and the hatch wouldn't close properly, so it hung open as they drove the short distance to their house.

他向明日香指出了这一点，两人便各自抬起树的一端，艰难地爬上陡峭的楼梯。如果明日香独自一人，她很可能无法搬运这棵树，因为它本身就相当沉重，再加上那些近乎梯子的楼梯，几乎是不可能完成的任务。他们将树抬到前门后，明日香急忙跑回自己家，开车驶过几户人家，停在路边。这棵树勉强塞进了他们的旅行车后备箱，但后备箱盖无法完全关闭，因此他们开车回家的短短路程中，后备箱一直敞开着。

Now, they had just brought the tree inside, and Asuka had finished dusting it off, but the question of were to put it still remained. The obvious place was the living room they spent so much time in, with the roaring fire, but Asuka was still having difficulties deciding.

现在，他们刚把树搬进屋内，明日香也完成了除尘工作，但树该放在哪里仍是个问题。显而易见的地方是他们经常待的客厅，那里有熊熊燃烧的壁炉，但明日香仍在犹豫不决。

"What do you think Shinji?" Asuka asked as she turned towards him.

“你怎么看，真嗣？”明日香转向他问道。

"I don't care where we put the damn thing, as long as it gets placed somewhere," Shinji muttered unenthusiastically.

“我不在乎我们把它放哪儿，只要有个地方就行，”真嗣无精打采地嘟囔着。

Asuka frowned at his lack of enthusiasm, but didn't comment any further. Shinji had been incredibly unhelpful ever since they got the tree through their front door. He didn't see how important finding the right location for the tree was, and Asuka had already asked his opinion several times. If she wasn't still debating on where to put it, she probably would have stomped on his foot.

明日香皱眉看着他缺乏热情的样子，但没有进一步评论。自从他们把圣诞树搬进家门后，真嗣就一直帮不上忙。他不明白找到合适位置对圣诞树有多重要，而明日香已经多次征求他的意见。如果不是还在犹豫该放哪里，她可能早就踩他一脚了。

The living room wasn't large by some houses standards, and lacked a vaulted ceiling, so the tree barely fit. Asuka wondered where the family that lived here once, would have put their tree when they got one every year, but couldn't figure it out. It certainly seemed that they would have had to move some furniture around to make it fit. Even the other living room, the one that had a flatscreen T.V. didn't have any room, but Asuka wouldn't have put the tree there, even if there was room.

客厅按某些房子的标准来说并不大，也没有高耸的天花板，所以树几乎塞不进去。明日香好奇以前住在这里的家庭每年是怎么放他们的圣诞树的，但想不出答案。显然，他们得挪动一些家具才能放得下。就连另一个有平板电视的客厅也没有空间，但即使有地方，明日香也不会把树放在那里。

Eventually, Asuka decided to place the tree in the corner, directly to the left of the fireplace. Because of that, they had to move the glass table away from the window. Shinji was just glad that she had made up her mind.

最终，明日香决定将树放在壁炉左边的角落里。因为这个决定，他们不得不将玻璃桌从窗边移开。真嗣只是庆幸她终于拿定了主意。

With the position of the tree finally settled, they brought the boxes up from the garage and placed them beside the couch. Before going through the rest of them though, Shinji made a suggestion, and Asuka was only too happy to agree. It had been many hours now since breakfast, and both of them were hungry. Shinji made a hurried batch of sandwiches, and they ate them in the living room.

随着树的位置终于确定，他们从车库搬来箱子，放在沙发旁边。不过在检查其他箱子之前，真嗣提出了一个建议，明日香非常乐意同意。自从早餐后已经过去了很多小时，两人都饿了。真嗣匆忙做了一些三明治，他们在客厅里吃了起来。

"Thanks for this," said Asuka as she leaned into the couch cushion. She had just finished her third sandwich, unaware of how hungry she had been.

“谢谢你这么做，”明日香说着，靠在沙发垫上。她刚吃完第三个三明治，没意识到自己有多饿。

"No problem," shrugged Shinji. He had been hungry as well, considering how early he had been up. He was even starting to feel a bit drowsy, but he fought it for now.

"没问题，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。考虑到他起得有多早，他也同样饿了。他甚至开始感到有点困倦，但他现在努力抵抗着。

Finishing the sandwiches, they began going through the rest of the boxes, and hanging ornaments on the tree as they did. The box of lights they left in a corner, forgotten, since they severed no real purpose. Though Shinji helped, it was ultimately Asuka who gave the finally say so on which ornaments to hang, and which were too ugly. She was incredibly picky, and once or twice asked Shinji if he was an idiot for suggesting something so ugly. Even so, Shinji had to admit that he was having fun, but knowing what he had to tell Asuka eventually still weighed on his mind. Ultimately, it came down to how he felt he should explain something like that. While Shinji was holding this debate in his mind, Asuka found a star in the fourth box, which brought his mind away from this temporarily.

他们吃完三明治后，开始逐一打开剩下的箱子，边开边往树上挂装饰品。角落里那盒灯饰被遗忘了，毕竟它们没什么实际用途。虽然真嗣帮忙了，但最终决定挂哪些装饰品、哪些太丑的，还是明日香说了算。她非常挑剔，有一两次还问真嗣是不是傻，怎么会提议挂那么丑的东西。即便如此，真嗣不得不承认自己玩得很开心，但一想到最终还得告诉明日香那件事，心里还是沉甸甸的。归根结底，他纠结的是该如何解释那种事。就在真嗣内心挣扎时，明日香在第四个箱子里找到了一颗星星，暂时转移了他的注意力。

"What do you think?" asked Asuka as she held the star in front of Shinji.

“你觉得怎么样？”明日香拿着星星在真嗣面前问道。

"Its not bad...I think?" “还不错吧……我觉得？”

"You really don't know anything, do you?" sighed Asuka in pity. "I wouldn't call it ideal, but it will work."

“你真是什么都不懂，是吧？”明日香叹息着，带着一丝怜悯，“虽然算不上理想，但勉强能用。”

The star was relatively cheap, made out of plastic, and had a single bulb inside of it. Holes covered the star, supposedly allowing the light from the bulb to shine through. This didn't serve much purpose for them, but it was the only suitable thing to put on top of the tree. Handing the star to Shinji, who was taller than Asuka, he stood on his tiptoes, placing the star at the top of the tree.

这颗星星相对廉价，由塑料制成，内部仅有一枚灯泡。星星表面遍布孔洞，据说是为了让灯泡的光线透射出来。这对他们而言并无太大意义，但已是唯一适合放在树顶的装饰。他将星星递给比明日香高的真嗣，自己踮起脚尖，将星星稳稳地安置在树顶。

"It looks kinda cheesy," muttered Asuka.

“看起来有点俗气，”明日香嘀咕道。

"I can take it back down then if you want," said Shinji.

"如果你愿意，我可以把它再拿下来，" 真嗣说道。

"No, thats okay. Having nothing up there would just look weird. Alright, help me with the rest of this stuff," said Asuka as she pointed to a large pile of ornaments. They had taken them out of the box, and strewn them across the floor. As Shinji went to reply, his tiredness won over, and he was unable to stifle the yawn that escaped his lips.

"不用，那样也行。上面什么都没有反而显得奇怪。好吧，帮我处理剩下的这些东西，" 明日香指着一大堆装饰品说道。他们已经把它们从盒子里拿出来，散落了一地。当真嗣正要回答时，他的疲惫占了上风，一个哈欠不由自主地从他嘴里逃了出来。

"You tired?" asked Asuka.

"你累了吗？" 明日香问道。

"Like I said, I didn't sleep much last night," replied Shinji.

“就像我说的，昨晚我没怎么睡，”真嗣回答道。

Asuka eyed him for several seconds, debating something, until she finally opened her mouth and said, "Take a nap then if you're tired. I can handle the rest of this."

明日香盯着他看了几秒钟，似乎在考虑什么，最后她张嘴说道：“如果你累了，那就小睡一会儿吧。剩下的我可以处理。”

"No Asuka, its fine. I'll stay and help."

“不，明日香，没关系。我会留下来帮忙。”

"You're tired. Sleep," replied Asuka, her voice bristling with authority.

“你累了。睡吧。”明日香回答道，她的声音中透着不容置疑的威严。

Shinji didn't think they would start yelling at each other like earlier, but he didn't want to give reason to either. Thus, he decided on a compromise.

真嗣没想到他们会像之前那样开始互相吼叫，但他也不想给任何一方提供理由。因此，他决定采取折中的办法。

"I'll stay down here, and sleep on the couch then."

"我会待在楼下，就在沙发上睡。"

Raising an eyebrow, Asuka asked, "You think you can sleep with me searching through boxes?"

明日香挑了挑眉，问道：“你觉得你能在我翻箱倒柜的时候睡着吗？”

"I don't think I'll have a problem with it."

"我觉得这对我来说不是问题。"

"...Fine, do as you want," said Asuka, resigning herself to the situation.

“……好吧，随你便。”明日香无奈地接受了现状。

Walking upstairs, Shinji grabbed a blanket and pillow off his bed, before returning downstairs, and laid down on the couch. Since he didn't get much sleep last night, he had little difficulty drifting off in a matter of minutes.

真嗣走上楼，从床上抓起一条毯子和一个枕头，然后回到楼下，躺在沙发上。由于昨晚没怎么睡，他没花多少时间就陷入了梦乡。

As for Asuka, she paused in her work, and glanced towards him. She couldn't believe that he could fall asleep so easily like that. If it had been Asuka sleeping there instead, she would have found it much more difficult, for a multitude of reasons. Still, it wasn't everyday that she got to see Shinji like this. Smirking briefly, she continued sorting through the ornaments, deciding what was worthy to go on their tree, and what was not.

至于明日香，她停下手中的活，瞥了他一眼。她不敢相信他能这么轻易就睡着。如果换成是明日香躺在那里，她会因为种种原因而难以入睡。不过，能看到真嗣这样子也不是常有的事。她微微一笑，继续整理装饰品，决定哪些值得挂在树上，哪些不值得。

Several hours passed, and Asuka had long finished decorating the tree when Shinji awoke. Without anything better to do, after she finished with the ornaments, Asuka continued reading a book, leaning up against the couch. Turning a page, she felt somebody stir above her. Glancing upwards, she saw Shinji rolling over, and thought that he was simply repositioning himself. Seconds later though, he turned back over, his face facing hers now, and slowly opened his eyes. Asuka felt a blush creeping up her face, but ignored it for now.

几个小时过去了，当真嗣醒来时，明日香早已完成了圣诞树的装饰。在挂完装饰品后，她无事可做，便继续靠在沙发上读一本书。翻过一页时，她感觉到上方有人动了动。抬头一看，她看到真嗣翻了个身，以为他只是在调整姿势。然而几秒钟后，他又翻了回来，脸朝向她，缓缓睁开了眼睛。明日香感到脸颊泛起红晕，但暂时忽略了这份羞涩。

"Good morning Shinji, or I guess its closer to evening now." Asuka was right; night was quickly descending on them.

"早上好，真嗣，或者现在更接近晚上了。" 明日香说得没错；夜幕正迅速降临在他们身上。

"How long was I asleep for?" asked Shinji, still not entirely aware how close Asuka was to him.

"我睡了多久？" 真嗣问道，仍然没有完全意识到明日香离他有多近。

"Almost three hours if I had to guess," said Asuka.

"如果我没猜错的话，差不多三个小时了，" 明日香说。

"Hmmm...huh? What are you doing?" asked Shinji, now fully aware that Asuka was leaning against the couch, directly where his head was placed.

"嗯...啊？你在干什么？" 真嗣问道，现在完全意识到明日香正靠在沙发上，正好是他头所在的位置。

"I was reading, until somebody interrupted me," said Asuka indicating her book.

"我本来在看书，直到某人打断了我，" 明日香指着她的书说道。

"Oh, sorry about that," mumbled Shinji. Usually, it was he who was laying where Asuka was, so seeing their positions swapped was strange.

"哦，抱歉打扰了，" 真嗣咕哝着。通常情况下，是他躺在明日香现在所在的位置，所以看到他们的位置互换感觉很奇怪。

"Did you finish the tree?" asked Shinji as he began sitting up.

"你把树弄完了吗？" 真嗣边问边开始坐起身来。

"See for yourself." "你自己看吧。"

As she said this, Shinji turned to look at the tree. Even at just a glance, it was obvious that Asuka spent considerable time thinking how best to go about decorating it. Without any lights, there was a significant lack of glow emanating from the tree. To make up for this, Asuka had rather cleverly used the plain silk balls colored red, blue, and green, wrapping them around the tree in a design, similar to that of the lights. This pattern consisted three times around the tree, with an assortment of different ornaments spaced in between them. Shinji even noticed, that Asuka had used two of the children's ornaments. Besides the tree, on the glass table which had been moved away from the window enough to give the tree room, was a perfect crèche, displaying the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem. Asuka had apparently found this packed carefully away by itself in one of the boxes.

正如她所说，真嗣转向那棵树望去。仅一眼便能看出，明日香在装饰这棵树上花费了不少心思。由于没有灯光，树上的光芒明显不足。为了弥补这一点，明日香巧妙地使用了红色、蓝色和绿色的普通丝绸球，将它们围绕树干设计成类似灯光的图案。这种图案在树上环绕了三次，其间点缀着各式各样的装饰品。真嗣甚至注意到，明日香还用了两个孩子们的装饰品。除了树之外，被移到远离窗户足够位置以腾出空间的玻璃桌上，摆放着一个完美的马槽场景，展示了耶稣基督在伯利恒的诞生。显然，明日香是在其中一个盒子里小心翼翼地找到了这个被单独包装的马槽。

"You sure seemed to put a lot of thought into it," remarked Shinji.

"你确实花了很多心思在这上面，" 真嗣评论道。"

"You can tell?" "你能看出来吗？"

"Its hard not to." "很难看不出来。"

"Hmph," snorted Asuka. Getting up, she sat down on the couch beside Shinji, admiring her work from where she sat.

"哼，"明日香哼了一声。她站起身，坐在真嗣旁边的沙发上，从她的位置欣赏着自己的作品。

"How did you come up with the idea for the silk balls?" asked Shinji.

“你是怎么想到用丝球的点子的？” 真嗣问道。

"It just sorta came to me," replied Asuka with a shrug.

“就那么突然想到的，” 明日香耸耸肩回答。

"Well, it does give the tree a better feel, like its less plain."

嗯，确实让树看起来更有感觉，没那么单调。

"I'm not sure whether to take that as a compliment, or not. I feel like that model took longer to put together than hanging the actual ornaments though," she said while gesturing to the crèche.

"我不确定这是不是在夸我，还是别的什么。我觉得搭建那个模型花的时间比挂真正的装饰品还要长，" 她一边说一边指着马槽场景。

"It certainly is a nice touch," said Shinji.

"确实是个不错的点缀，" 真嗣说。

"I agree." "我同意。

Neither of them could be considered religious, but they still knew the story about the birth of Jesus. It is what Christmas was about in the first place.

他们俩都不能算是虔诚的信徒，但他们仍然知道耶稣诞生的故事。这正是圣诞节的初衷。

"You getting hungry at all?" asked Shinji.

"你饿了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No, not really," said Asuka. "I think I wanna stay like this for a while."

"不，不太饿，" 明日香说。"我想就这样待一会儿。"

After she said this, Asuka grabbed the blanket that Shinji had put to the side, and wrapped one end around herself. Taking a brief glance at it, she decided to offer it to Shinji as well. The blanket was large enough for both of them, even if they were on opposite ends of the couch. Shinji took it gratefully, albeit, a little surprised at Asuka's offer. He didn't say anything on the subject, nor did he remind her that it was his to begin with.

说完这话，明日香抓起真嗣放在一旁的毯子，将自己裹在其中一端。她瞥了一眼，决定也把它递给真嗣。这条毯子足够大，即使他们坐在沙发的两端也能覆盖到。真嗣感激地接过，虽然对明日香的提议有些惊讶。他没有对此发表任何意见，也没有提醒她这毯子原本就是他的。

They sat in silence, wrapped in the same blanket, watching the fire blazing in front of them. It was turning out to be a different day then Shinji had anticipated. When Asuka had reminded him about their talk of Christmas, and told him what she wanted to do, he had groaned inwardly. Now, he was glad that she had suggested this. Even if it didn't hold any significance, and was something from their past lives, it still felt somehow right to be doing this. It helped to put off what he had to do eventually at least.

他们静静地坐着，裹在同一条毯子里，看着面前的火焰熊熊燃烧。这一天与真嗣预想的截然不同。当明日香提醒他关于圣诞节的谈话，并告诉他她想做什么时，他内心叹息。现在，他很高兴她提出了这个建议。即使这没有任何意义，只是他们前世的事情，但这样做不知为何感觉是对的。至少，这有助于推迟他最终必须做的事情。

Was right now, the moment when he should bring his dream up? He had had that same thought throughout the entire day, but always put it off till later. Was he afraid of what her reply would be? Or did he believe that if he ignored it for long enough, it would just go away. Either way, he had repeatedly put this off, and the mood seemed to be good between them currently. Maybe right now was-

现在正是时候提起他的梦想吗？他一整天都在想着这件事，却总是推迟到以后。他是在害怕她的回答吗？还是他认为只要忽视得够久，问题就会自行消失。无论哪种情况，他一再拖延，而眼下他们之间的气氛似乎还不错。或许现在正是——

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka.

“嘿，真嗣？”明日香问道。

"..." “……”

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"What, sorry?" replied Shinji, startled at Asuka's sudden shout. He hadn't heard her the first time, lost in his own thoughts.

“什么，抱歉？”真嗣被明日香突如其来的喊声吓了一跳。他第一次没听到她的话，沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"Don't tell me you're tired again."

"别告诉我你又累了。"

"No...I was just thinking about something. What did you want?"

"不...我只是在想些事情。你想要什么？"

"I just thought of something."

"我刚刚想到了一些事。"

"What?" “什么？”

"Well, about Christmas and all. Since it is something that comes with the holiday, I was thinking that you should get me something."

"嗯，关于圣诞节什么的。既然这是节日的一部分，我在想你应该送我点什么。"

Shinji nearly pointed out how pointless this suggestion was, considering whatever they found was essentially theirs. A present for Asuka though; he couldn't even begin to imagine what she would like. It was a funny thought to think about.

真嗣差点指出这个建议多么无意义，毕竟他们找到的任何东西本质上都是他们的。不过，给明日香准备礼物；他甚至无法想象她会喜欢什么。这个想法倒是挺有趣的。

"So, what about myself then?"

“那么，我自己呢？”

"What about you?" replied Asuka, clearly not thinking that Shinji needed a present.

“你呢？”明日香回答道，显然不认为真嗣需要礼物。

"Its unfair that I only would have to get you something. If we're doing this, it has to be a proper gift exchange."

"这不公平，只有我得给你准备礼物。既然我们要这么做，那就得是正式的礼物交换。"

"Why should I?" "我为什么要这么做？"

"Because if you don't get me something, I won't get you anything."

"因为如果你不给我准备什么，我也不会给你任何东西。"

"Jeez, fine. We'll do a damn gift exchange then," grumbled Asuka. "But I expect you to find me something amazing."

"哎呀，好吧。那我们就搞个该死的礼物交换吧，"明日香嘟囔着。"但我可指望你能找到个超棒的东西给我。"

'I'll worry about that later,' thought Shinji. He had other things he wanted to get to, but Asuka didn't seem to be in the mood to talk anymore. Standing up, she let the blanket slide off her and stretched.

'这个我晚点再操心吧，'真嗣心想。他还有其他事情想处理，但明日香似乎已经没心情再聊下去了。她站起身，让毯子从身上滑落，伸了个懒腰。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji.

“你在做什么？”真嗣问道。

Turning back towards him, she said, "I'm going upstairs I think. All the work today, with the tree and all, made me tired, so I think I'm gonna turn in early. Not to mention that seeing you sleep made me feel tired as well."

她转过身面对他，说道：“我想我要上楼去了。今天忙了一整天，又是搬树又是别的，让我觉得累了，所以我想早点休息。更别提看到你睡觉的样子也让我感到疲倦。”

"Without dinner?" “不吃晚饭吗？”

"I'm still not really hungry. Maybe if I awake up later, I will be. But not right now. I assume you're wide awake currently?"

“我还是不太饿。也许晚点醒来我会饿的。但现在不行。我想你现在应该很清醒吧？”

"Yeah, more or less," said Shinji.

“嗯，差不多吧。” 真嗣说道。

'Tell her. Tell her now before she goes upstairs, otherwise you wont have a chance later,' said a voice in his head.

“告诉她。现在就告诉她，在她上楼之前，否则你以后就没机会了。” 他脑海中有个声音说道。

"Well, night then," said Asuka as she turned towards the staircase, and began ascending it.

“那么，晚安。” 明日香说着，转身朝楼梯走去，开始往上走。

'Damn it! Move!' Shinji told himself, but his body didn't seem to want to listen to him. Eventually, the sound of Asuka's footsteps disappeared upstairs, and Shinji lost his chance.

'该死！动啊！' 真嗣对自己说，但他的身体似乎不愿听从。最终，明日香上楼的脚步声消失了，真嗣错失了机会。

'Am I a coward?" asked Shinji towards himself. 'Do I simply not want to risk pushing Asuka away? Is it better for her to not know about this, or tell her? I was told to trust her, but I don't know if I can even trust myself.'

'我是个懦夫吗？' 真嗣自问。'我只是不想冒险把明日香推开吗？不让她知道这件事对她更好，还是告诉她？我被告知要信任她，但我甚至不知道自己能否信任自己。'

Never before had Shinji thought about these kind of things. If he wasn't like this, if he didn't have this power, they could have continued living peacefully, uncaring about what the future might hold. No matter what, Shinji couldn't ignore what he was anymore. He had this power, but didn't know anything about it, where it had come from, why he had it. Did it have something to do with his memory loss? Was he part of some experiment at Nerv? Was his power the reason he was alive? Then what of Asuka? Was the reason they were together like this, because she had this power as well? That seemed ridiculous though. Asuka wasn't like him, that much he was sure of.

真嗣从未想过这类事情。如果不是这样，如果他没有这种力量，他们本可以继续平静地生活，不在乎未来会怎样。无论如何，真嗣无法再忽视自己的存在。他拥有这种力量，却对它一无所知，它从何而来，为何他有它。这与他的记忆丧失有关吗？他是 Nerv 某个实验的一部分吗？他的力量是他活着的原因吗？那么明日香呢？他们在一起的原因，是因为她也有这种力量吗？这听起来很荒谬。明日香不像他，这一点他很确定。

Leaving the couch, he decided to occupy himself, and packed away the remaining ornaments Asuka had left on the ground. For now, he would store the boxes back in the garage, but leave them out of the attic. He couldn't be sure that Asuka wouldn't want to add more things later.

离开沙发，他决定找点事情做，开始收拾明日香留在地上的剩余装饰品。眼下，他会把这些盒子暂时放回车库，但不会放到阁楼上去。他不能确定明日香以后是否还会想添置更多东西。

With that done, Shinji returned to the kitchen, made himself soup, and brewed himself a cup of tea. The rain had subsided outside, and was only sprinkling now, so Shinji brought one of the dining room chairs outside and sat beside the grill, drinking his soup and sipping his tea. Enough time had passed by, where Asuka was almost certainly asleep. If so, then Shinji should be able to attempt this right now.

完成这些后，真嗣回到厨房，给自己煮了碗汤，又泡了杯茶。外面的雨势已经减弱，现在只是零星飘洒，于是真嗣搬了把餐厅的椅子到外面，坐在烤架旁，一边喝着汤一边品茶。时间已经过去不少，明日香想必已经熟睡。如果是这样，那么真嗣现在应该可以尝试了。

Even though he had wanted to explain things to Asuka, he was unsure how to go about doing that. In his dream, his other self had demonstrated the AT-field, leaving no doubt to its power. Showing it to Asuka was the easiest way to convince her, but he also felt as though doing so would frighten her. Especially if it was Shinji's first time projecting it as well. Right now, it would be better if he tried practicing with it first, just so he understood how to control it. His other self had used it with ease, but Shinji suspected his first attempt wasn't going to be so easy.

尽管他本想向明日香解释一切，但却不确定该如何着手。在他的梦中，另一个自己展示了 AT 力场，其威力毋庸置疑。向明日香展示它是说服她的最简单方法，但他也觉得这样做可能会吓到她。特别是如果这也是真嗣第一次投影它的话。现在，最好先练习一下，以便他了解如何控制它。另一个自己使用起来轻松自如，但真嗣怀疑自己的第一次尝试不会那么容易。

Finishing his tea and soup, he returned inside and left his dishes in the sink. Donning a jacket from the closet near the front door, he quietly turned the knob, and exited out into the night.

喝完茶和汤后，他回到屋内，将餐具留在水槽里。从靠近前门的衣柜里穿上一件夹克，他轻轻转动门把手，悄然步入夜色。

Shinji walked down several rows of houses, glance back over his shoulder towards his own house that he had just left. He wanted to be sure that the window to the master bedroom, Asuka's room, wasn't able to see him from where he stood. The flash of orange may be impossible to hide, but with luck, Asuka won't notice it at all.

真嗣走过几排房屋，回头望向刚刚离开的家。他想确认主卧室的窗户，也就是明日香的房间，是否能看到他现在站的位置。橙色的闪光或许难以隐藏，但幸运的是，明日香可能根本不会注意到。

Reaching the end of the road, Shinji looked down both sides of the street. The rain had begun picking up again, and he noticed that he was starting to shiver. Best get this over with he assumed.

走到路的尽头，真嗣向街道两边望去。雨势又开始加大，他察觉到自己开始发抖。最好尽快解决这件事，他想。

He once looked at his AT-field as an extension of himself, and his other self in his dream said that he was essentially right. It was far more than that however. An extension, was different compared to something that was a part of him, innate almost, like another limb that was normal to him, but abnormal to others. He understood now, that his AT-field was something that was part of who he was.

他曾将 AT 力场视为自己的延伸，梦中的另一个自己说他的理解基本正确。然而，这远不止如此。延伸与内在的一部分不同，几乎是天生的，就像他习以为常而他人却觉得异常的另一个肢体。现在他明白了，AT 力场是他自身的一部分。

What was an AT-field though? Asuka's brief explanation hadn't mentioned that, so Shinji could only speculate. Some form of energy seemed obvious, but it went deeper than that. The AT-field was part of him, built into his DNA. Was it a manifestation, like his soul or something? Shinji didn't know whether he was right or wrong in this speculation, only that it was a part of who he was.

那么，AT 力场究竟是什么？明日香的简短解释并未提及这一点，因此真嗣只能猜测。某种形式的能量似乎显而易见，但它的内涵远不止于此。AT 力场是他的一部分，嵌入他的 DNA 中。它是灵魂的体现吗？真嗣不知道自己的猜测是对是错，只知道这是他自身的一部分。

In his dream, his other self had controlled it so easily. He had swung his arm down, and the AT-field had projected according to his thoughts. Was it that easy? Shinji didn't think so, and almost instinctively knew that there was something else. He could feel his AT-field, sense its presence within him. It was almost like, he had to throw it out, and mold it using his thoughts. Was it possible to create whatever he wanted then, if he thought deeply enough about it? For now though, Shinji thought that he would stick to something simple.

在他的梦中，另一个自己曾如此轻易地操控着它。他挥下手臂，AT 力场便依他的意念展开。真的这么简单吗？真嗣不这么认为，他几乎本能地感觉到还有其他因素。他能感受到自己的 AT 力场，感知到它在他体内的存在。仿佛，他必须将其抛出，再用自己的思维塑造它。那么，如果他深入思考，是否就能创造出任何他想要的东西呢？不过眼下，真嗣觉得还是从简单的事物开始为好。

Deciding to do something similar to what his other self had done, he turned his gaze upwards towards the sky. If he had wanted, he probably could have destroyed something, like a telephone pole or something, but unwanted destruction was sure to wake Asuka with the loud racket. Instead, simply sending it upwards towards the sky would suffice for now. Did his AT-field have a range, or did it depend on his own thoughts?

决定效仿另一个自己的做法，他将目光转向天空。如果他愿意，或许能摧毁某样东西，比如电线杆之类的，但不必要的破坏肯定会以巨大的噪音吵醒明日香。因此，现在只需将它朝天空发射就足够了。他的 AT 力场有范围限制吗，还是取决于他自己的意念？

Gathering himself, he thought about the shape that he wanted. Simple, almost like a narrow blade, that could still cut anything. Imagining the image in his mind, he looked upwards again, before swinging his right arm towards the night sky. The flash of orange certainly happened, but it wasn't like Shinji had expected. Instead of a narrow blade, something closer to the width of a broadsword was suddenly projected in front of him. Seconds later, there was a rushing feeling that Shinji got, as his AT-field returned to him. This wasn't what he expected. Was his imaging that bad for the narrow blade, or did he just not understand how to use his AT-field?

他集中精神，思考着想要的形状。简单，近乎细长的刀刃，却能斩断一切。在脑海中构想出这个形象后，他再次抬头望向夜空，随后向右臂挥向天际。橙色的闪光确实出现了，但并不像真嗣预想的那样。不是细长的刀刃，而是更接近宽刃剑的宽度突然在他面前显现。几秒钟后，真嗣感受到一种急速回归的感觉，他的 AT 力场回到了他身上。这并非他所预期的。是他对细长刀刃的想象太糟糕，还是他根本不懂得如何运用自己的 AT 力场？

Practicing several more times, each time Shinji did, he was only able to project the broadsword like blade. Shifting to different images, Shinji tried a simple square, a dome, and a wall. Each of them were larger then he expected, and the wall in particular seemed to have a certainly intensity about it that the others hadn't. Was his AT-field simply too powerful for him to control right now? Shinji was suddenly glad that he decided to try this first, before showing Asuka. The results could have been disastrous.

经过几次练习，每次真嗣尝试时，他只能投影出宽刃剑。他尝试变换不同的图像，如简单的方形、圆顶和墙壁。每一个都比他预期的要大，尤其是那堵墙，似乎有一种其他物体所没有的强烈感。难道是他的 AT 力场太过强大，以至于他目前无法控制吗？真嗣突然庆幸自己决定先尝试这个，而不是直接展示给明日香看。结果可能会很糟糕。

Letting his arm fall back to his side, he suddenly felt drained of energy. He hadn't felt this exhausted in a long time, and assumed it had to do with using his AT-field. Currently, prolonged usage of it wore him out. Was his AT-field then the reason that he never grew tired, and the reason he regenerated from wounds, or was that something else?

他让手臂垂回身侧，突然感到精力耗尽。他已经很久没有这么疲惫过了，猜测这可能与使用 AT 力场有关。目前，长时间使用它会使他筋疲力尽。那么，他的 AT 力场是他从不感到疲倦和从伤口中再生的原因吗，还是另有其他原因？

Calling it quits there, Shinji turned away from the street corner, and began walking back towards the house. The rain fell around him, but he hardly noticed it right now. He wasn't even cold anymore.

决定就此放弃，真嗣转身离开街角，开始往家的方向走去。雨水环绕着他，但他几乎没注意到。他甚至不再感到寒冷。

As difficult as it was for him to believe, his AT-field was considerably power, just judging by what he had witnessed. His mind, was a different story. The memories that he lacked from those fours months, were clearly crucial in building up his AT-field. Experience is what he had likely accumulated from constant usage of it, but as he was currently, he was just beginning to understand its uses. His body was no different from that time, but it was his mind that lacked the ability to use the AT-field properly. Its usage though, that was a problem. He knew that the Evangelions and Angels both had AT-fields, and understood that they both fought using them. Did he fight using his AT-field then, against the Angels as an Evangelion pilot. But then-

尽管难以置信，但根据他所见，他的 AT 力场显然相当强大。他的心智，则是另一回事。那四个月里他缺失的记忆，显然对构建他的 AT 力场至关重要。他可能通过不断使用积累了经验，但就目前而言，他才刚刚开始理解其用途。他的身体与那时无异，但正是他的心智缺乏正确使用 AT 力场的能力。然而，使用它是个问题。他知道 EVA 和使徒都有 AT 力场，并理解它们都用其战斗。那么，他作为 EVA 驾驶员是否也用 AT 力场与使徒战斗呢？但接着——

"Does that mean I fused with the Evangelion somehow, and gained this ability, or am I-"

"这是否意味着我以某种方式与 EVA 融合了，从而获得了这种能力，还是我——"

'Am I an Angel?' he finished in his mind.

“我是个天使吗？”他在心中完成了这句话。

Shinji paused on the side of the street, thinking that. An Angel...was it possible he was something like that? The AT-field, regenerating tissue...red eyes.

真嗣在街边停下脚步，思考着这个问题。天使……他可能是那样的存在吗？AT 力场，再生组织……红眼睛。

'Thats right,' Shinji thought suddenly. 'My self inside my dream had red eyes.'

“没错，”真嗣突然想到，“我梦中的自己有着红眼睛。”

Without further thought, he rushed back to his house. Marching up the front steps to the door, he quietly opened it, not wanting to wake Asuka now of all times. Entering the dining room, he grabbed one of the candles and struck a match, before entering the bathroom on the ground floor. Placing the candle on the bathroom counter, he looked at his reflection in the mirror. His reflection stared back at him, devoid of red eyes, the normal brown ones looking back at him.

没有多想，他冲回了家。迈上前门的台阶，他轻轻地推开门，不想在这个时候吵醒明日香。走进餐厅，他抓起一支蜡烛，点燃了火柴，然后进入了底楼的浴室。将蜡烛放在浴室柜台上，他看着镜子中的自己。镜中的他回望着，没有了红色的眼睛，正常的棕色眼睛正回望着他。

Shinji breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't known what to expect, but he was relieved that his eyes were still their normal brown.

真嗣松了一口气。他不知道自己期待什么，但很庆幸自己的眼睛依然是正常的棕色。

'I'm over thinking this,' thought Shinji.

'我这是想太多了，'真嗣心想。

Leaving the bathroom, he blew out the candle, and placed it back on the dining room table. Even though he had taken a nap earlier, he felt unbelievable tired, and trudged his way upstairs. Changing out of his wet clothes, he threw himself down onto the mattress and was out in a matter of minutes, breathing deeply, without any dream interrupting his sleep tonight.

离开浴室后，他吹灭了蜡烛，将其放回餐厅桌上。尽管之前小憩过，他仍感到难以置信的疲惫，拖着沉重的步伐上楼。换下湿衣服后，他一头栽倒在床垫上，几分钟内便沉沉睡去，深沉的呼吸中，今晚没有梦境打扰他的睡眠。

Minutes passed, before a slight creak was heard at the end of the upstairs hallway. Footsteps fell onto the carpet, before stopping at Shinji's door. He had left the door ajar, and the hand had only to press gently against it, opening the door slowly. Asuka peered into Shinji's room from the hallway, a frown barely visible on her face due to the fading moonlight. She didn't say anything, but simply stared at his peaceful body for several minutes, until she retreated from his door, and returned to her own room. Asuka didn't know why Shinji had left the house at such an hour, but hoped that he would eventually tell her.

几分钟过去了，楼上走廊尽头才传来轻微的吱嘎声。脚步声落在地毯上，随后停在真嗣的房门前。他出门时未将门完全关上，只需轻轻一推，门便缓缓开启。明日香从走廊探头望进真嗣的房间，月光渐暗，她脸上的皱眉几乎难以察觉。她没有出声，只是静静凝视着他安详的睡颜数分钟，然后退回门口，回到自己的房间。明日香不明白真嗣为何会在这样的时刻离家，但她希望他最终会告诉她。

Okay, so first off, this chapter was a lot of fun to write, for obvious reasons. And I hope that everybody understood that brief two paragraph section after the opening. It was a big debate for me, whether to include that or not, when this story (at least half of it) is entirely about Shinji and Asuka's journey to grow close to each other again. Its called Two of Us, so thats to be expected.

好吧，首先，这个《一千零一夜》写起来非常有趣，原因显而易见。我希望大家都理解开场后的那两小段内容。我曾为此犹豫不决，是否要包含那部分，毕竟这个故事（至少一半）完全是关于真嗣和明日香重新靠近彼此的旅程。它的名字叫《我们俩》，所以这是可以预料的。

Onto my update pattern. Today, being Wednesday, is now three weeks away from Christmas, so I'll be posting a new chapter every Wednesday, leading up to Christmas. Depending on how much I actually end of writing, there may be two chapters that come out in one week, or maybe I'll just do two chapters Christmas day. That actually makes more sense. So it shall be!

关于我的更新模式。今天是星期三，距离圣诞节还有三周，所以我将在每个星期三发布新的《一千零一夜》，直到圣诞节。根据我实际写出的内容多少，可能会有两周发布两章，或者干脆在圣诞节当天发布两章。这样其实更有道理。那就这么定了！

Until then! 在那之前！

### Chapter 15: Distance

As promised, here's the second chapter in this month of updates. Just this passed week, I felt like going back and watching some Evangelion, since it's been a while, and I sometimes forget how completely f-ed up that show is. Fantastic story and character relationships, but still heavily screwed up. Alright, just thought I'd say that. Till next week then!

正如承诺的那样，这是本月更新的第二篇 chapter。就在上周，我突然想重温一下《新世纪福音战士》，毕竟已经有一段时间了，有时候我会忘记这部作品有多么的扭曲。故事和人物关系非常精彩，但仍然严重扭曲。好了，只是想说一下。那么，下周见！

---

Five days had passed since Shinji first used his AT-field, and since that first night, he had practiced every night since then. Unfortunately, he didn't feel like much had changed since that first night. Try as he might, he couldn't get his AT-field to form properly. No matter what shape he imagined, or tried to project, it didn't act like he wanted it to. Every night he did this, without any change, and came home dejected each time.

自从真嗣第一次使用他的 AT 力场以来，已经过去了五天，从那晚开始，他每晚都在练习。不幸的是，他感觉自那晚以来并没有什么变化。无论他怎么努力，都无法正确地形成 AT 力场。无论他想象什么形状，或者试图投影什么，它都不像他想要的那样行动。每晚他都这样做，没有任何改变，每次回家都感到沮丧。

Of course, he didn't know this, but Asuka knew that he was doing this every night. She wasn't a fool, and though she didn't investigate what he was doing, she did check up on him every night when he came back, passed out on his bed. During one of these nights, Asuka caught Shinji snoring rather loudly, and she nearly burst out laughing at that. 'What could make him this tired though?' is what she always thought. Whatever he was doing late in the night, Asuka didn't think it was merely taking a walk.

当然，他并不知情，但明日香知道他每晚都在这么做。她并不傻，尽管没有探究他在做什么，但她每晚都会在他回来，瘫倒在床上时检查他的情况。有天晚上，明日香听到真嗣打呼噜打得相当响，差点笑出声来。'是什么让他这么累呢？'她总是这样想。无论他深夜在做什么，明日香不认为那只是散步那么简单。

Besides Shinji's constant practice with his AT-field, and Asuka wondering when Shinji was going to tell her this, their relationship hadn't changed much. They were closer to each other, but it almost felt like a stalemate. When they had been living in the tent, sleeping next to each other was natural occurrence, and though they still spent every waking moment in each others company, it almost felt like something was missing. Neither brought this up of course, either unsure about what they were feeling, or having more important things on their mind.

除了真嗣不断练习他的 AT 力场，以及明日香好奇真嗣何时会告诉她这一切之外，他们的关系并没有太大变化。他们彼此更亲近了，但感觉却像陷入了僵局。在帐篷里生活时，睡在彼此旁边是自然而然的事，尽管他们仍然每时每刻都在一起，却总觉得少了些什么。当然，谁也没有提起这一点，无论是对自己的感受不确定，还是有更重要的事情在心头。

Nearly a week had passed now since Asuka had told them they were celebrating Christmas, and with the tree set up and everything, it was just a matter of time until that day approached. Looking forward towards the future, Asuka decided that this may as well be the moment when they start keeping track of the days. When they had been searching for a tree five days ago, Asuka remembered spotting a calendar in somebody's house, and left to go get it. Shinji had begrudging obeyed her wishes and not followed her. Christmas fell on the final Friday in 2015, so considering that Asuka had said, 'lets celebrate Christmas in three weeks,' that basically meant that the first Friday in December was when they began counting the days. Of course, they both knew that this was likely inaccurate, since they never did figure out exactly what day Third Impact occurred on. Still, thinking that it was the 10th of December in the year 2015 made it all seem more real to them.

自从明日香告诉他们要庆祝圣诞节以来，已经过去近一周了。随着圣诞树的竖立和一切准备就绪，那一天的到来只是时间问题。展望未来，明日香决定这或许正是他们开始记录日子的时刻。五天前他们在寻找圣诞树时，明日香记得在某户人家看到了一个日历，于是便去取了回来。真嗣虽不情愿，但还是遵从了她的意愿，没有跟随。圣诞节落在 2015 年的最后一个星期五，所以考虑到明日香说的“让我们在三周后庆祝圣诞节”，这基本上意味着他们从 12 月的第一个星期五开始倒数。当然，他们俩都知道这很可能不准确，因为他们从未确切弄清楚第三次冲击发生的具体日期。不过，想着那是 2015 年 12 月 10 日，对他们来说这一切似乎变得更加真实了。

Shinji hadn't forgotten about Asuka's unreasonable request either. No matter how unreasonable it was however, Shinji didn't see how he could get around it. A present, well, it wasn't as though Shinji didn't have an unlimited amount of options. Problem was, no matter how long he had been around Asuka, he didn't have a clue as to what she liked. Shinji was no expert in gift exchanges, having never given a gift to anybody ever before, but tacking on the fact that Asuka was a girl, Shinji felt his situation was hopeless. Asking what Asuka would like didn't help either, since Shinji had already tried that approached. She had simply told him, 'Get me something you think I'll like.' Shinji knew Asuka too well to know that, if what he got her didn't live up to her expectations, she would break him. But Shinji had to think that, Asuka had to get him something as well, so was she having a similarly difficult time in her decision?

真嗣也没有忘记明日香那无理的要求。尽管它多么不合理，真嗣却想不出如何回避。礼物嘛，虽然选择并非无限，但问题在于，无论与明日香相处多久，他始终摸不透她的喜好。真嗣在送礼方面毫无经验，毕竟他从未给任何人送过礼物，再加上明日香是个女孩，这让他感到处境无望。询问明日香喜欢什么也无济于事，因为他已经尝试过这种方法，而她只是告诉他：“选你觉得我会喜欢的东西。”真嗣深知明日香的性格，如果他送的东西达不到她的期望，她绝对会让他吃不了兜着走。但真嗣也必须考虑到，明日香同样需要为他挑选礼物，那么她是否也在选择上遇到了类似的难题呢？

With these worrying thoughts, and no progression towards improving his control over his AT-field, Shinji woke up that Thursday morning. Walking downstairs already fully dressed, he began making breakfast, and was shortly joined by Asuka.

带着这些令人担忧的想法，以及对 AT 力场控制毫无进展的困扰，真嗣在那个周四的早晨醒来。他穿着整齐地走下楼，开始做早餐，不久后明日香也加入了进来。

"Coffee or tea?" asked Shinji.

“咖啡还是茶？”真嗣问道。

"Coffee I think," said Asuka as she trifled a yawn. Shinji only noticed then, that Asuka had a towel tucked under her arm.

“我想喝咖啡，”明日香一边说一边打了个哈欠。直到那时，真嗣才注意到明日香腋下夹着一条毛巾。

"Isn't it a little cold to be taking a shower?" asked Shinji.

"现在洗澡不会有点冷吗？" 真嗣问道。

"The rain has stopped for now, so I'm going to take this opportunity."

"雨暂时停了，所以我要抓住这个机会。"

"Even so," muttered Shinji.

"即便如此，" 真嗣嘀咕道。

Asuka walked by him, indifferent towards his question about it being too cold. Freezing or not, she still intended on taking a shower; warming up near the fire took little time anyway.

明日香从他身边走过，对他的问题漠不关心，是否太冷对她来说无关紧要。无论多冷，她都打算洗个澡；毕竟在火边取暖也花不了多少时间。

While Shinji finished cooking breakfast, Asuka stepped out into the backyard, walking around the corner from the kitchen window, and grabbed the two buckets. The rain water that filled them was usually enough so that she didn't have to fill them herself, as it was today. Pulling off her shirt, pants, and underwear, she tossed them to the side momentarily. The clouds overhead weren't nearly as dark as they had been in recent memory, and Asuka hoped that they may get some respite from the rain.

当真嗣做完早餐时，明日香走出后院，从厨房窗户绕过角落，拿起两个水桶。通常雨水就足够填满它们，今天也是如此。她脱下上衣、裤子和内衣，暂时扔到一边。头顶的云层远没有最近记忆中那么阴沉，明日香希望他们能暂时摆脱雨水的困扰。

Rinsing down her body, she shivered at the cold water, and quickly applied shampoo to her hair. Pouring more water over her head, she washed the shampoo away, and ran her hands through her hair. She would have liked to apply conditioner as well, but a third rinse was pushing her plummeting temperature. Wrapping a towel around herself, she bent down, grabbing the clothes she had tossed aside, and returned inside.

她用冷水冲洗身体，不禁打了个寒颤，迅速在头发上涂抹洗发水。再倒些水在头上，冲洗掉洗发水，用手梳理头发。她本想也用护发素，但第三次冲洗会让她的体温进一步下降。她裹上毛巾，弯腰捡起刚才扔掉的衣服，回到屋内。

"Breakfast almost done?" asked Asuka as she stepped through the side door.

"早餐快好了吗？" 明日香一边推开侧门一边问道。

"Close," said Shinji, glancing briefly at Asuka before looking away quickly. "You have enough time to dry off I think."

“好了，”真嗣说道，短暂地瞥了明日香一眼后迅速移开目光。“我想你有足够的时间擦干。”

"Okay," said Asuka, giving Shinji one passing look before leaving the kitchen. When she did, Shinji let out a low sigh. Every time she did this, Shinji couldn't help but feel embarrassed. Her wet hair, the water molecules clinging to her skin, the fact that she was wrapped in nothing but a towel; these thoughts naturally passed through Shinji's mind, and a part of him suspected that Asuka enjoyed seeing him flustered. The only times he dared taking a shower, was when he knew Asuka was busy doing something else, and even then he was cautious.

“好吧，”明日香说道，匆匆看了真嗣一眼后离开了厨房。她一走，真嗣便轻轻叹了口气。每次她这样做，真嗣都忍不住感到尴尬。她湿漉漉的头发，水分子附着在她的肌肤上，她只裹着一条毛巾的事实；这些念头自然而然地掠过真嗣的脑海，他的一部分怀疑明日香喜欢看他慌张的样子。他唯一敢洗澡的时候，是知道明日香在忙别的事情，即便如此他也很小心。

In the living room, Asuka had already finished changing, and was now finishing drying her hair. She didn't feel uncomfortable changing here, even though Shinji was only a single room away. She had grown used to these situations, and knew that Shinji didn't have it in him to peep anyway.

在客厅里，明日香已经换好了衣服，正在擦干头发。即使真嗣只隔着一个房间，她也不觉得在这里换衣服有什么不自在。她已经习惯了这种情况，也知道真嗣没有偷看的胆量。

Sitting down on the couch, she waited for the announcement of breakfast being done, but meanwhile, mulled over some of her thoughts. It was now more than two months since her and Shinji had begun living together. In that short amount of time, Asuka couldn't tell whether she had grown at all. Matured, maybe, but in a physical sense, she couldn't tell if she was any different. Even Shinji himself, didn't seem any different from when she had first met him.

她坐在沙发上，等待着早餐完成的通知，同时沉思着自己的一些想法。她和真嗣开始同居已经超过两个月了。在这短短的时间里，明日香不确定自己是否有所成长。或许在心智上成熟了些，但在身体上，她看不出自己有何不同。就连真嗣本人，似乎也和她初次见面时没什么两样。

'Why am I thinking about him?' wondered Asuka.

“我为什么要想着他？”明日香暗自思忖。

Well, there was still his present to considered. Asuka wasn't sure what to get him, only knowing that he had some taste for classical music, of which she only knew a couple songs from Germany. Other than that, she didn't know what he liked, or what his interests were. Getting a present for somebody when you had so little to go on, was certainly difficult. Other than that, his late night adventures were starting to bug her. When was he going to tell her what he was doing?

嗯，还有他的礼物需要考虑。明日香不确定该给他买什么，只知道他对古典音乐有些兴趣，而她只熟悉几首德国的曲子。除此之外，她不了解他的喜好或兴趣。当你对某人了解甚少时，挑选礼物确实很困难。除此之外，他深夜的冒险开始让她感到困扰。他什么时候才会告诉她自己在做什么呢？

"Asuka, breakfast is ready," Shinji called from the other room.

"明日香，早餐准备好了。" 真嗣从另一个房间喊道。

"Alright," Asuka replied back.

"好的，" 明日香回应道。

Getting up, she entered the dining room, only to find Shinji just finishing laying out the table with silverware and plates.

她起身走进餐厅，只见真嗣刚好摆好餐具和盘子。

"Whats with this?" asked Asuka gesturing towards the extravagant setting.

“这是怎么回事？”明日香指着奢华的场景问道。

Shrugging, Shinji replied, "Just thought that doing something like this every now and then wouldn't be bad."

真嗣耸了耸肩，回答道：“只是觉得偶尔这样也不错。”

"If you say so," frowned Asuka.

“随你便吧，”明日香皱眉道。

Considering that the long table had only been set for two, Asuka was deciding which end to sit at. Admittedly though, sitting on opposite sides of the table when it was just the two of them seemed rather pointless. While Shinji was in the kitchen, Asuka moved the plates so that they were sitting beside each other, instead of far away. As Shinji came back into the living room, he paused as he saw what Asuka had done.

考虑到长桌只摆了两人的餐具，明日香正在犹豫该坐哪一头。不过说真的，就他们俩的情况下，隔着桌子面对面坐着似乎没什么意义。趁真嗣还在厨房，明日香挪动了盘子，让他们并排坐在一起，而非相隔甚远。当真嗣回到客厅，看到明日香的安排时，他停顿了一下。

"It doesn't make much sense to be spaced so far apart," said Asuka, in answer to Shinji's unspoken question.

"间隔这么远，实在没什么意义，" 明日香回答了真嗣未说出口的问题。

Shinji didn't reply to Asuka, instead, setting two cups of coffee on the table that he had been carrying, before returning to the kitchen with the rest. When he returned, it was with a large, steaming pot of rice, with some sort of sauce spread over it.

真嗣没有回应明日香，而是先将手中的两杯咖啡放在桌上，然后带着剩下的返回厨房。当他再次回来时，手里端着一大锅冒着热气的米饭，上面铺着某种酱料。

"Not exactly breakfast material," commented Asuka.

"这可不算是早餐的料，" 明日香评论道。

"Not like we can be choosy in what our options are."

“我们也没什么挑三拣四的余地。”

"Speaking of which, if the day continues to be like this, I think we should go to grocery store."

说到这个，如果天气一直这样，我想我们该去杂货店了。

"I didn't think you'd be one to suggest that," said Shinji as he sat down beside her. "Though you are right." Shinji would like to get out of the house for a while as well.

“没想到你会提出这个建议，”真嗣说着，在她身边坐下。“不过你说得对。”真嗣也想出去透透气。

They ate breakfast, conscious of each others presence and trying not to bump elbows, but continually kept a conversation going. Shinji couldn't explain it though, but it felt like they were being unusually polite to each other, like a lukewarm feeling. Shinji knew that he had to explain his AT-field to Asuka eventually, but that was after he finally learned how to control it properly. As for Asuka, what did she seem hesitant about?

他们共进早餐，彼此间留意着对方的存在，尽量避免肘部碰撞，却始终保持着对话。尽管如此，真嗣说不清为什么，总觉得他们之间异常客气，有种不冷不热的感觉。真嗣明白，他迟早得向明日香解释自己的 AT 力场，但那得等他真正学会如何控制它之后。至于明日香，她在犹豫什么呢？

After dinner, Shinji washed the plates, while Asuka changed into something more comfortable. When she came back downstairs, she was decked out in full winter gear, complete with jacket, mittens, and a scarf.

晚餐后，真嗣洗着盘子，而明日香则换上了更舒适的衣物。当她回到楼下时，她已经全副武装，穿着冬装，包括夹克、连指手套和围巾。

"Aren't you overdoing it?" asked Shinji as he spotted Asuka's attire.

“你不觉得有点夸张吗？”真嗣看到明日香的装扮问道。

"Your not the one who took a shower earlier. It's freezing out there," retorted Asuka.

“你又不是之前洗过澡的那个人。外面冷得要命，”明日香反驳道。

Grinning slightly, Shinji finished washing the last dish, and walked to the front door, grabbing a jacket out of the closet.

微微一笑，真嗣洗完了最后一个盘子，走向前门，从衣橱里抓起一件夹克。

"Ready?" asked Asuka. “准备好了吗？”明日香问道。

Nodding, Shinji led the way out the door, and to their car.

点头示意后，真嗣领路出门，走向他们的车。

This was only there second time going to this grocery store since they had begun living at their house. It wasn't relatively far, but Asuka had to drive slower now because of the presence of ice on the road. Every time they hit a patch of ice, Shinji braced himself, fearing that they'd suddenly go spinning out of control. Asuka didn't seem worried at all however, and always smirked at Shinji whenever this happened. Maybe if he was driving the car, and was in control of the situation, he would feel better about it.

这是他们搬进新家后第二次来这家杂货店。虽然不算太远，但因为路上有冰，明日香不得不开得更慢。每次遇到结冰路段，真嗣都紧张地做好准备，生怕车子会突然失控打转。然而明日香似乎一点也不担心，每次发生这种情况时总是对真嗣露出得意的笑容。或许如果他来开车，掌控局面，他会感觉好一些。

Arriving at the store, Asuka parked the car directly in front, and stepped out. A brief breeze played across her face, tickling her nose, and making her hair blow in the wind; combined with the breeze, it must have been close to below freezing.

抵达商店后，明日香直接将车停在前方，然后下了车。一阵轻风拂过她的脸颊，轻挠着她的鼻子，使她的头发随风飘扬；加上这阵风，气温肯定接近零下了。

"Lets get this over with," said Asuka.

“赶紧办完这事吧，”明日香说。

"Agreed," replied Shinji. Though he was rarely affected by the cold, even he was starting to wish that he had added an extra layer of clothes.

“同意，”真嗣回答道。虽然他很少受寒冷影响，但就连他也开始希望自己多穿了一层衣服。

Stepping through the doors, Shinji grabbed a shopping cart, and wheeled it further into the store. Because of the rain and wind, water had been blown into the front of the store, and had now frozen over, making it difficult to pass the first few feet passed the entrance. Asuka slipped several times, and inadvertently grabbed onto Shinji, pulling him down with her. Though Shinji grumbled about it each time, he still assisted in helping Asuka up, who's chinks were always tinged red. Bypassing this treacherous blockade, Shinji pushed the cart down the aisle, pulling things off at random. Asuka wandered down other aisles, thinking of anything specifically they might needed, but ultimately leaving the decision up to Shinji; he was the one who cooked as it was.

穿过门廊，真嗣抓起一辆购物车，推着它深入店内。由于风雨交加，水被吹进了商店前部，现在已经结冰，使得入口后的头几英尺难以通行。明日香滑倒了几次，无意中抓住了真嗣，把他一起拽倒。尽管真嗣每次都抱怨，但他还是帮忙扶起明日香，她的脸颊总是泛着红晕。绕过这个危险的障碍，真嗣推着购物车沿着过道走，随意地拿取商品。明日香则在其他过道徘徊，思考着他们可能需要什么，但最终还是把决定权交给真嗣；毕竟，做饭的是他。

Returning to the aisle that Shinji was on, she paused beside him, noticing where his gaze was directed.

回到真嗣所在的过道，她在他身边停下，注意到他的目光所向。

"What are you thinking?" asked Asuka.

“你在想什么？”明日香问道。

"Spaghetti for tonight I think," replied Shinji. He was looking at a clear package of pasta, debating on whether to get it or not.

"今晚吃意大利面吧，我觉得。" 真嗣回答道。他正看着一包透明的意大利面，犹豫是否要买。

"Can you make that though?" asked Asuka

"你会做那个吗？" 明日香问道

"Sure. Tomato sauce, some salt, garlic, olives...nothing else besides that. Boiling the pasta might take some time with the grill we have, but other than that, it shouldn't be a problem. Unless you had something else in mind?"

"当然。番茄酱，加点盐，大蒜，橄榄...除了这些没什么别的了。用我们的烤架煮面可能要花点时间，但除此之外，应该没问题。除非你有其他想法？"

"No, this actually works. I've been getting sick of rice."

“不，这真的管用。我已经吃腻米饭了。”

"I didn't think I would either, being Japanese, but I have to agree with you," agreed Shinji.

“我也没想到，毕竟我是日本人，但我得同意你的看法，”真嗣赞同道。

Making his decision, he grabbed the spaghetti pasta off the shelf, and gathered up the remaining ingredients required for dinner tonight. Afterwards, they left the store, being extra careful on there way out. Stacking the groceries into their car, they pushed the cart off into some random direction, and piled back in. As nice as it was to get out of the house for a while, Shinji was just glad that they were returning. This cold was really starting to bother him, and he looking forward to the warmth of the fireplace at home.

他下定决心，从货架上抓起意大利面，并收集了今晚晚餐所需的其他食材。随后，他们小心翼翼地离开了商店。将杂货堆放进车里，他们将购物车推向某个随机的方向，然后又坐回车内。尽管外出一会儿感觉不错，但真嗣很高兴他们即将回家。这场寒冷真的开始困扰他了，他期待着回到家中壁炉的温暖。

Putting the car in gear, Asuka began backing out, looking over her shoulder until she changed gears, and drove away. She was careful as usual when returning home, avoiding patches of ice when she could, and driving extra careful over those that she couldn't avoid. In little to no time, they were driving back down their neighborhood street, and pulling into their houses driveway.

明日香将车挂上档，开始倒车，直到换档并驶离，她一直回头看。像往常一样，她在回家时非常小心，尽可能避开结冰的地方，并在无法避免时格外小心驾驶。没过多久，他们就驶回了社区街道，并开进了自家车道。

Leaning back in her seat, Asuka let out a low sigh, her breath visible because of the cold.

靠在座位上，明日香轻轻叹了口气，因寒冷而呼出的气息清晰可见。

"I don't think I'm going to be moving very far away from the fireplace today," said Asuka.

"我觉得我今天不会离壁炉太远，"明日香说道。

Shinji wasn't paying attention to her however. He was already out of the car, and had been about to open the back hatch to begin unloading the groceries when he saw something falling from the heavens. Holding out his palm, the ice crystal melted in his hand as it came in contact with his skin. Looking up again, he saw similar crystals falling from the sky; it had finally begun snowing.

然而，真嗣并没有注意到她。他已经下了车，正准备打开后备箱开始卸货时，他看到了天上掉下来的东西。伸出掌心，冰晶接触到他的皮肤便融化了。再次抬头望去，他看到类似的晶体从天而降；终于开始下雪了。

"Just great," groaned Asuka.

"真是太好了，"明日香咕哝道。

Turning towards his right, he saw Asuka leaning against the car, frowning, as she looked up towards the sky.

他转向右边，看到明日香靠在车上，皱着眉头，抬头望向天空。

"With all the rain we've been getting, it was only a matter of time until it started snowing. I surprised you aren't happy anyway, considering how much you enjoy Christmas."

“下了这么多雨，下雪只是时间问题。我倒觉得你应该高兴，毕竟你那么喜欢圣诞节。”

"It's one thing to enjoy a white Christmas while inside, with the heat on, and a cup of hot chocolate. It's entirely different to have a white Christmas, without heat, or hot chocolate, to soothe you."

“在室内享受一个有雪的圣诞节，开着暖气，手里捧着一杯热巧克力，是一回事。而在没有暖气，也没有热巧克力来安慰你的情况下，过一个有雪的圣诞节，则是完全不同的另一回事。”

"I don't dislike it though," said Shinji truthfully.

"不过我并不讨厌它，" 真嗣真诚地说道。

"Thats you," grumbled Asuka. Glancing towards the sky one final time, she turned towards Shinji and said, "Come on, lets hurry this up. I don't want to be standing out here forever because you're so fascinated with the sky."

"这就是你，" 明日香咕哝着。最后一次瞥向天空，她转向真嗣说道，"快点，我们赶紧结束吧。我不想因为你对天空如此着迷而一直站在这里。"

'You could have gone inside if you wanted to,' thought Shinji, but he didn't mention this.

'如果你想进去，你本可以进去的，' 真嗣心想，但他没有说出口。

Together, they gathered up the groceries, and brought them inside, retreating from the cold. Shinji stored everything away, and then returned to the living room, where Asuka was already buried under two blankets, only the top of her head visible from where he stood.

他们一起收拾好杂货，搬进屋内，避开了寒冷。真嗣将所有东西归置妥当，然后回到客厅，只见明日香已经裹在两层毯子下，从他站立的位置只能看到她的头顶。

"You didn't even bother changing out of your clothes?"

“你甚至都没换衣服？”

"Its warmer this way," retorted Asuka, her eyes narrowing in defiance.

“这样更暖和，”明日香反驳道，眼中闪过一丝挑衅。

Shinji nearly grinned, but stopped himself as he caught the glint in her eyes. Still, he couldn't deny how warm to probably was under those blankets. So, walking around the edge of the couch, he sat on the side furthest from Asuka, and threw the two blankets over himself. Asuka smirked at him, but didn't say anything. After several moments, Asuka grabbed a book that she had left by the couch and began reading, and seconds later, Shinji didn't the same thing. Still, as Shinji began reading, he was aware of the enormousness of the space separating them, and how it seemed so empty.

真嗣差点笑出声，但看到她眼中的光芒时忍住了。不过，他无法否认在那些毯子下确实可能很暖和。于是，他绕过沙发，坐在离明日香最远的一侧，将两条毯子盖在自己身上。明日香对他微微一笑，但什么也没说。片刻后，明日香拿起沙发旁的一本书开始阅读，几秒钟后，真嗣也做了同样的事。然而，当真嗣开始阅读时，他意识到两人之间巨大的距离，以及那种空旷感。

They passed the rest of the day as such, with very little interactions between each other, until dinner arrived later that day. At some point, Shinji put down his book and entered the kitchen, beginning to boil the water. Meanwhile, Asuka had put her book to the side, and laid down on the couch, stretching her legs outward. The snow had continued at a steady rate, but had stopped for now, though there was still at least three inches that had accumulated outside by now.

他们就这样度过了余下的时光，彼此间几乎没有交流，直到那天晚上的晚餐时间。期间，真嗣放下手中的书，走进厨房开始烧水。与此同时，明日香也把书搁置一旁，躺在沙发上，双腿伸展开来。雪一直在下，但此刻暂时停了，尽管外面已经积了至少三英寸厚的雪。

"It'll take some time for the water to boil to the point where I can add the pasta," came Shinji's voice.

"水烧开到可以加面条的程度还需要一些时间。" 真嗣的声音传来。

Tilting her head upwards, Asuka saw Shinji leaning against the doorway that led towards the kitchen.

阿斯卡抬头望去，看到真嗣正倚靠在通往厨房的门框上。

"How long?" “多久了？”

"Not sure," said Shinji as he walked towards the couch. Moving her feet out of the way, Asuka sat up, letting Shinji sit beside her. They sat in silence for several seconds, both having their own thoughts on their minds. As for Asuka, she was wondering whether she should just admit to Shinji that she knew he was leaving the house every night. On the other hand, Shinji was debating whether he should just flat out tell Asuka about his AT-field. In the end, neither of them mentioned their worries, and the stalemate continued

“不太确定，”真嗣边说边走向沙发。阿斯卡挪开脚，坐起身来，让真嗣坐在她旁边。他们沉默地坐了几秒钟，各自心中都有所思。至于阿斯卡，她在犹豫是否应该向真嗣坦白她知道他每晚都离开家。另一方面，真嗣则在考虑是否应该直接告诉阿斯卡关于他的 AT 力场。最终，两人都没有提及各自的担忧，僵局依旧持续。

When the water reached boiling point, Shinji returned to the kitchen, and continued preparing dinner, and after another twenty minutes, called Asuka in. They ate dinner together in relative silence, opposite of how breakfast had been, and afterwards, Shinji washed the dishes by himself; Asuka had already gone upstairs, complaining about the cold. It would have been warmer downstairs, but Shinji got the feeling she would rather be left alone. Even he-

当水沸腾时，真嗣回到厨房，继续准备晚餐。又过了二十分钟后，他叫来了明日香。他们相对沉默地共进晚餐，与早餐时的热闹截然不同。饭后，真嗣独自洗碗；明日香早已上楼，抱怨着寒冷。楼下其实会更暖和些，但真嗣感觉她宁愿独自待着。就连他——

In the midst of cleaning the glass that he had clasped in his hand, it suddenly shattered, showering his hand with fragments of glass. A shriek of pain forced itself upwards towards his throat, but Shinji battled against it, subduing it in the end. His hand stung with pain, sharp pieces of glass deeply dug into his skin. What had happened? Did he clench the glass too tightly by accident, or was it something else?

在擦拭手中紧握的玻璃杯时，它突然碎裂，玻璃碎片如雨般洒落在他手上。一声痛苦的尖叫几乎要冲破喉咙，但真嗣奋力压制，最终将其平息。他的手刺痛不已，锋利的玻璃碎片深深扎入皮肤。发生了什么？是他不小心握得太紧，还是另有原因？

The sound of running feet alerted Shinji to the presence of Asuka, and as he turned around, he saw her jumping the last few steps of the staircase, before darting into the kitchen.

奔跑的脚步声让真嗣意识到明日香的存在，他转过身，看到她跳过楼梯的最后几级，然后冲进了厨房。

"What happened?" asked Asuka, seeing the shattered remains of the glass at Shinji's feet.

“发生什么事了？”明日香问道，看到真嗣脚边碎裂的玻璃碎片。

"Nothing," said Shinji, turning away from Asuka and hiding his bleeding hand.

“没什么，”真嗣说着，避开明日香的目光，藏起了他流血的手。

"Don't treat me like an idiot Shinji," said Asuka. Taking several steps toward him, she grabbed his right arm, and spun him around, her eyes immediately locking onto his bloody hand.

"别把我当傻瓜，真嗣，" 明日香说道。她朝他走了几步，抓住他的右臂，猛地一转，目光立刻锁定在他流血的手上。

"Shinji, how-" began Asuka, but she never finished. Just as it had done before, Shinji's hand began regenerating, except this time, it seemed different. Instead of the blood flowing back into the wound like it had done before, the wound began regenerating, several million cells working in conjunction. The glass was first forced out of the wound, and then the skin began scabbing over. As the scabs turned into skin, it left the color shiny and raw, before shortly looking as though nothing had ever happened.

"真嗣，怎么——" 明日香刚开口，却没能说完。就像之前发生过的那样，真嗣的手开始再生，但这次似乎有所不同。不再是血液回流到伤口中，而是伤口开始自行再生，数百万细胞协同工作。玻璃首先被从伤口中挤出，随后皮肤开始结痂。随着痂皮转化为皮肤，它呈现出光亮而未愈合的色泽，但很快便恢复如初，仿佛什么都没发生过。

Being as this was only the second time either of them had seen this, neither Shinji, nor Asuka, was sure how to retort to this. But Shinji, in a far back corner of his mind, knew that the change in his regeneration was due to his practice with his AT-field. Maybe he was improving in a way that he couldn't see?

由于这是他们第二次目睹这一现象，无论是真嗣还是明日香，都不确定该如何回应。但在真嗣内心深处的一个角落里，他知道这种再生变化是因为他练习 AT 力场的结果。或许他在某种看不见的方式上有所进步？

"Are you okay?" asked Asuka, breaking the silence.

"你还好吗？"明日香打破了沉默。

Looking at her for the first time, Shinji tried smiling, and said, "Yeah, I'm fine."

第一次看着她，真嗣尝试微笑，并说：“嗯，我没事。”

"No you're not," said Asuka, seeing through Shinji's facade. "How could you be fine after something like this? I mean-"

“不，你不是，”明日香看穿了真嗣的伪装，“经历了这种事，你怎么可能没事？我是说——”

"This isn't anything new Asuka," Shinji reminded her.

“这对我们来说并不新鲜，明日香，”真嗣提醒她。

"But it still reminds you...reminds you of you are," said Asuka, pausing in the midst of her sentence.

“但它仍然提醒你……提醒你你是，”明日香在句子中间停顿了一下。

"Like I said, I'm fine," said Shinji.

“就像我说的，我没事，”真嗣说。

Turning away from her, Shinji began bending down to clean up the broken fragments of glass, but Asuka wasn't done with him yet.

真嗣转身离开她，开始弯腰清理破碎的玻璃碎片，但明日香还没说完。

"How did this glass break?"

"这玻璃怎么碎了？"

"I dropped it," muttered Shinji.

"我摔的，" 真嗣嘟囔道。

"Then why is your hand cut up instead of your feet?"

“那为什么是你的手受伤，而不是脚呢？”

Shinji didn't have a reply to that, so he simply didn't say anything. Couldn't Asuka take a hint? He didn't want to talk about this right now.

真嗣对此无言以对，于是他干脆什么也没说。难道明日香就不能领会这暗示吗？他现在不想谈论这个。

"Shinji, what aren't you telling me?"

"真嗣，你有什么没告诉我？"

At her words, Shinji's head whipped up to stare at her. Asuka's gaze was fixed, unwavering as she stared back at him. She wasn't going to shrug this off, not now. Still, Shinji played dumb for the time being.

听到她的话，真嗣猛地抬起头盯着她。明日香的眼神坚定，毫不退缩地回望着他。她不会就这么算了，现在不会。尽管如此，真嗣暂时还是装傻。

"I don't know what you mean," said Shinji as he started gathering up all of the small fragments of glass.

"我不知道你在说什么，"真嗣说着开始收拾所有的小玻璃碎片。

"Yes you do," retorted Asuka. "You know exactly what I mean. What I want to know is, why aren't you telling me? I thought we were supposed to trust each other?"

"你确实知道，" 明日香反驳道，"你清楚我指的是什么。我想知道的是，你为什么不告诉我？我以为我们应该互相信任？"

"How can that be, if I don't even trust myself?" snarled Shinji. Asuka hadn't expected this reaction from him, let alone the words he had just uttered. Shinji had told her everything about himself until now, so why was he withholding this thing. However important it was, or strange, or inhuman, Asuka could take it. She had seen some unreal things, and even been a part of them thanks to Nerv, so she could take whatever Shinji was hiding.

"如果我连自己都不信任，那怎么可能呢？" 真嗣咆哮道。明日香没料到他会这样反应，更别提他说出的那些话了。真嗣一直对她无话不谈，为什么这次要隐瞒。无论这件事有多重要、多奇怪或多非人，明日香都能接受。她见过一些超乎现实的事物，甚至因为 NERV 而亲身经历过，所以无论真嗣隐瞒了什么，她都能承受。

"Don't say that," mumbled Asuka. "You don't believe that."

“别这么说，”明日香咕哝道，“你并不真的这么认为。”

"Don't I?" grimaced Shinji. "I know better than anybody who I am, and whether I can trust myself or not."

"难道我不该吗？" 真嗣苦笑道，"我比任何人都清楚自己是谁，以及我是否能信任自己。"

"Shinji-" “真嗣——”

"Leave me alone Asuka!" "别管我，明日香！"

Shinji shouted this statement, his face turned away from Asuka. He couldn't deal with this, not right now. He wanted to be left alone, forgetting everything for a while; forgetting that he had this cursed power.

真嗣大声喊出这句话，脸转向一边，不愿面对明日香。他现在无法处理这些，他只想一个人待着，暂时忘掉一切；忘掉自己身上这该死的诅咒般的力量。

"You idiot!" “你这个白痴！”

With a rush of air, Asuka swung her hand backwards, and then swung it forward, slapping Shinji across the face. Without another word to him, Asuka retreated from the kitchen, her entire body shaking with anger. He didn't even flinch when she had slapped him; what was wrong with him? Asuka didn't know, but she had had enough of Shinji's idiocy. Walking up the stairs, still fuming, she slammed the door closed and didn't come back down for the rest of the night.

随着一阵风声，明日香猛地向后挥手，然后向前一甩，狠狠地扇了真嗣一巴掌。她没有再对他说一句话，愤怒地颤抖着全身，离开了厨房。她扇他时，他甚至没有退缩；他到底怎么了？明日香不知道，但她已经受够了真嗣的愚蠢。她走上楼梯，依然怒气冲冲，砰地一声关上门，整晚都没有再下来。

After Asuka had hit him, Shinji had no visible reaction, and even now, minutes after Asuka's door had closed, Shinji was still in that kneeling position in front of the glass. Slowly, he began resuming the process of picking up the pieces. Right now, as long as he focused on something, and didn't think of what had just occurred, he could keep calm. He was angry, not only at Asuka, but at himself as well; more towards himself than her. He knew that Asuka was only trying to help, but he wished she would have left him alone. He made it clear he didn't want her interfering, but she still did.

在明日香打了他之后，真嗣没有任何明显的反应，甚至在她关门几分钟后，真嗣仍然跪在玻璃碎片前。慢慢地，他开始重新捡拾碎片。现在，只要他专注于某件事，不去想刚刚发生的事情，他就能保持冷静。他很生气，不仅对明日香，也对自己；更多的是对自己而不是她。他知道明日香只是想帮忙，但他希望她能让他一个人待着。他明确表示不希望她干涉，但她还是这么做了。

Making sure that the floor was clear of glass fragments, Shinji walked into the living room and sat down on the couch. He couldn't get comfortable though, and didn't honestly want to be here right now. Standing up, he walked to the front door, and not caring whether Asuka heard him or not, opened and closed the door without caring. It was obvious from their previous argument, that she knew he had been leaving somehow, but he just didn't care anymore.

确保地板上没有玻璃碎片后，真嗣走进客厅，坐在沙发上。然而，他感到坐立不安，说实话，此刻并不想待在这里。他站起身，走到前门，不在乎明日香是否听到，不加思索地开门又关门。从之前的争吵中显而易见，她知道他有意离开，但他已经不在乎了。

Snow was piled on the front few steps, and as Shinji left, he kicked at it in frustration. Even though it was freezing out, the adrenaline that was coursing through Shinji kept him warm for the time being, and his hand was still coated in some of his blood. The snow still hadn't begun falling again, but the ground was thick with the white substance, and Shinji trudged through it as he made his way to the end of the street.

门前几级台阶上堆满了雪，Shinji 离开时，懊恼地踢着雪。尽管外面冰冷刺骨，但涌动的肾上腺素让 Shinji 暂时感到温暖，他的手上还沾着一些血迹。雪虽然还没开始再次飘落，但地面已被厚厚的白雪覆盖，Shinji 艰难地穿过雪地，走向街道尽头。

At the corner, he didn't stop like he usually did, and kept walking down the next block. At the end of the block, was a streetlight, and Shinji crossed underneath the lights that were weighed down by the snow piled upon them. The ground was white, but Shinji's footprints still stood clearly out in the otherwise unblemished white powder.

在拐角处，他没有像往常一样停下来，而是继续走下一段街区。街区的尽头有一盏路灯，Shinji 穿过被积雪压弯的灯光。地面一片洁白，但 Shinji 的脚印在无瑕的雪地上依然清晰可见。

Shinji didn't know how long he continued walking like this for. He didn't expect Asuka to follow him, so he couldn't understand why he was walking so far away from their house. Maybe he just wanted to get as far away for the time being. Even though he couldn't say he enjoyed the notion of his AT-field, having those moments alone was something that he had missed. Him and Asuka had been together every moment for the passed two and a half months, and Shinji did occasionally need time to himself, just as Asuka did. Maybe that was why he was walking as far as he was; he had to cool off as well, since his anger was still a problem. He hadn't like shouting at Asuka, and hoped that she could forgive him.

真嗣不知道自己这样走了多久。他没想到明日香会跟着他，所以不明白为什么要走得离他们的家那么远。也许他只是暂时想尽可能地远离。尽管他不能说自己喜欢 AT 力场的概念，但那些独处的时刻是他所怀念的。他和明日香在过去两个半月里每时每刻都在一起，真嗣偶尔也需要自己的时间，正如明日香一样。也许这就是他走得这么远的原因；他也需要冷静下来，因为他的愤怒仍然是个问题。他不喜欢对明日香大喊大叫，并希望她能原谅他。

Now walking down the middle of what once would have been a busy street, Shinji passed several cars parked on the side of the road, snow covering their rooftops. Though the snow was pretty, it gave an added weight to the emptiness of the city. It really was just like a ghost town.

如今走在曾经繁忙的街道中央，真嗣经过了几辆停在路边的汽车，车顶覆盖着积雪。尽管雪景美丽，却为城市的空旷增添了一份沉重。这里真的就像一座鬼城。

Feeling more like himself now, Shinji stopped in the middle of the street, and let out a low sigh, clearly his mind of irrelevant things. Without a moments notice, he swung his arm downwards in front of him, projecting his AT-field outwards. He didn't damage the street, or the surrounding street lights, but simply projected his AT-field in front of him. The image he was trying was the simple wall, like a barrier. From what he had seen, this was the most basic form of the AT-field, but also the most complex for him. The sheer power of it was unbelievable, and the force was such that Shinji had difficulties not sliding backwards on the snow. Even now, he still wasn't able to conjure the proper image in his head. Was he simply weak? After five days of practice, he would have hoped to see some improvements. Was he not focused enough, or was his mind just focused elsewhere?

感觉自己更加自在，真嗣在街道中央停下脚步，低声叹息，清空了无关的思绪。他毫不犹豫地向前挥动手臂，释放出自己的 AT 力场。他没有破坏街道或周围的街灯，只是简单地在前方展开了 AT 力场。他尝试的形象是一堵简单的墙，像一个屏障。据他所见，这是 AT 力场最基本的形式，但对他来说也最为复杂。其强大的力量令人难以置信，产生的力量让真嗣在雪地上难以站稳。即便现在，他仍无法在脑海中形成正确的形象。是他太弱了吗？经过五天的练习，他本希望看到一些进步。是他不够专注，还是他的心思根本不在这里？

Letting his AT-field dissipate, he dropped his arm back at his side. Frustration surged through him at his lack of ability, and for the first time since learning about his AT-field, he felt like destroying something. How easy would it be to slice a telephone pole cleanly in half, or gouge out a large junk of the earth? Even if he was unable to control it, destroying something wouldn't be difficult.

任由 AT 力场消散，他将手臂垂回身侧。因自身能力的不足而涌起的挫败感，让他自得知 AT 力场以来首次萌生了破坏的冲动。将一根电线杆干净利落地一分为二，或是挖出一大块土地，该有多么容易？即便无法掌控，破坏某物也并非难事。

'No. Calm down,' he told himself. 'Getting angry and wrecking havoc wouldn't help me.'

'不，冷静下来，' 他对自己说。 '生气和制造混乱不会对我有任何帮助。'

'Maybe if you destroyed a house or two, you might gain better control over your AT-field though. After all, the AT-fields of both the Angels and Evangelions were used to attack and kill.'

'或许如果你摧毁一两栋房子，你可能会更好地控制你的 AT 力场。毕竟，使徒和 EVA 的 AT 力场都是用来攻击和杀戮的。'

A voice in his head spoke this, but Shinji tried his best to shake it away. Attacking and killing, he had never had thoughts like that before, but was that the purpose of the AT-field then? It felt much more like a sense of protection to Shinji.

脑海中有个声音如此说道，但真嗣竭尽全力想将其驱散。攻击和杀戮，他以前从未有过这样的念头，但这就是 AT 力场的用途吗？对真嗣来说，它更像是一种保护感。

Feeling unsure of himself, Shinji decided to end his practice for the day. Still, he didn't feel much like heading back, and ended up walking around Tokyo-2 for several more hours, before the cold finally started to affect his body, and he decided to head back.

感到自己心神不宁，真嗣决定结束今天的练习。尽管如此，他并不太想回家，结果在第二东京市又徘徊了几个小时，直到寒冷终于开始侵袭他的身体，他才决定回去。

Turning onto his neighborhoods street, he walked down the several rows of houses until he reached his own. Looking up towards the window of the master bedroom, he didn't see any sign of candle light. Of course though, it was late in the night now, and Asuka must have gone to bed hours ago. Sighing rather heavily, he walked up the driveway, and ascended the front steps, before opening the front door.

拐进自家街区的那条街道，他走过几排房子，直到到达自己的家。抬头望向主卧室的窗户，他没有看到任何烛光的迹象。当然，现在已经是深夜，明日香肯定几个小时前就上床睡觉了。他重重地叹了口气，走上车道，登上前门台阶，然后打开了前门。

The fire had long died out in the fireplace, and Shinji was tempted to relight it momentarily, but right now, he just wanted to crawl into his bed and pass out. Climbing the staircase, he paused briefly on the landing and looked out the window next to him. The snow was beginning to fall again it seemed; he hoped they wouldn't be buried in it. If it continued like this, they may not be able to leave the house for a while. Climbing the rest of the stairs, he paused as he reached the top, staring down the hallway where Asuka's door was. He was tempted to check on her, but maybe it was better to leave things till tomorrow. He didn't want to end up yelling at her again.

壁炉里的火早已熄灭，真嗣一时兴起想重新点燃，但此刻他只想爬上床昏睡过去。他爬上楼梯，在楼梯平台上短暂停留，望向身旁的窗户。似乎又开始下雪了；他希望他们不会被埋在雪中。如果雪继续这样下，他们可能暂时无法离开房子了。爬完剩下的楼梯，他在顶端停下，凝视着通往明日香房门的走廊。他很想去看望她，但或许留到明天更好。他不想再次与她争吵。

Resigning himself to sleep, he turned and opened his door, intent on falling asleep immediately upon impact with his bed. Laying down, he began throwing the covers over himself, but was met with some sort of resistance. Resistance? That didn't make any sense. Glancing towards his left, he finally spotted the small lump that he had initially missed. As dark as his room was, and the fact that his eyes were still adjusting to the lighting, it was understandable that he had missed this. Still, it was unmistakably Asuka, who was sleeping in his bed beside him.

他无奈地准备入睡，转身打开房门，打算一碰到床就立刻睡着。躺下后，他开始往自己身上盖被子，却遇到了某种阻力。阻力？这说不通。他朝左边瞥了一眼，终于发现了最初没注意到的小鼓包。房间里很暗，他的眼睛还在适应光线，没注意到这点可以理解。不过，那无疑是明日香，她正睡在他旁边的床上。

Upon realizing this, Shinji's first thought was to dart out of the bed, but now he was afraid that if he made any sudden movements, that he would accidentally wake her up. In this situation, if that were to happen, Shinji couldn't imagine how furious Asuka would be. Why though, was she in his bed in the first place? That seemed to be the question. Did she mistakingly get into his, instead of her own? But she seemed clear minded enough when he had last seen her stomping upstairs, that this shouldn't be possible. Then, had she been waiting for him to return home?

意识到这一点，真嗣的第一个念头是赶紧离开床，但现在他担心任何突然的动作都会不小心吵醒她。在这种情况下，如果真的发生，真嗣无法想象明日香会有多生气。不过，她为什么一开始就在他的床上？这似乎是个问题。难道是她误入了他的床，而不是她自己的？但当他最后一次看到她气冲冲地上楼时，她看起来头脑很清醒，这不应该发生。那么，她是在等他回家吗？

Shinji stopped as he thought this. Asuka knew that he had been going out for the past few days, and he certainly didn't attempt to hide this fact today especially. But to be waiting in his room, and sleeping in his bed nonetheless; just how unreasonable could she be? He still hadn't forgotten about the event that had happened during their first night here together, when she had decided to sleep with him of her own freewill. This was on a different level entirely.

碇真嗣想到这里停了下来。明日香知道他这几天一直在外出，而且今天他显然也没有试图隐瞒这一点。但要在他的房间里等他，甚至睡在他的床上；她到底能有多不讲理？他还没忘记他们第一天晚上在这里发生的那件事，当时她自愿决定和他一起睡。这完全是另一个层次的事了。

Either way, Shinji didn't feel like he had any choice in the matter, and began slowly moving off the bed. As he did this though, Asuka turned in her sleep, causing Shinji to freeze. She had been turned away from him, but now was facing him, her sleeping face clearly visible through the tangle of blankets. Shinji felt his heart rate speed-up upon seeing Asuka this vulnerable; this was a bad situation.

无论哪种情况，真嗣都觉得在这件事上自己别无选择，于是开始缓缓地从床上挪开。然而就在这时，明日香在睡梦中翻了个身，让真嗣僵住了。她原本背对着他，现在却面朝向他，凌乱的被褥间，她的睡颜清晰可见。看到明日香如此脆弱的样子，真嗣感到心跳加速；这情况不妙。

Forcing his mind to clear, he lifted one foot out of the bed, and then the other so that he was sitting on the edge of the bed. One final push is all it would take for Shinji to be free from all this; God or some other force didn't seem to wish this however. As Shinji began standing up, he suddenly felt somebody grab ahold of his wrist. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that Asuka was awake, her clear blue eyes staring back at him; her hand was holding onto his wrist, almost in a desperate fashion. Shinji didn't know what he could say.

他强迫自己清醒过来，抬起一只脚离开床铺，然后是另一只，就这样坐在床边。只需最后一下，真嗣就能摆脱这一切；但似乎上帝或其他某种力量并不希望如此。当真嗣开始站起来时，他突然感到有人抓住了他的手腕。回头一看，他发现明日香醒了，她清澈的蓝眼睛回望着他；她的手紧握着他的手腕，几乎是一种绝望的方式。真嗣不知道该说什么。

Slowly, Asuka begin sitting up, still holding onto his wrist, but now she wasn't looking at him. Drawing her legs upwards towards her chest, she sat like that in the bed, with the blankets still wrapped around her.

慢慢地，明日香开始坐起来，仍然抓着他的手腕，但现在她没有看他。她将双腿蜷缩到胸前，就这样坐在床上，被子依然裹在身上。

"You came back I see," mumbled Asuka, almost inaudibly.

“看来你回来了，”明日香喃喃自语，几乎听不见。

"I never intended on leaving," replied Shinji.

"我从没打算离开，" 真嗣回答道。

"I never said I thought you would."

"我没说过我认为你会离开。"

Even though she said this, Shinji was still under the impression that Asuka had thought he was leaving her. Had she been that worried?

尽管她这么说，真嗣仍然觉得明日香曾以为他会离开她。她真的那么担心吗？

"What were you doing out there?" asked Asuka after several seconds of silence.

"你刚才在外面做什么？" 沉默几秒后，明日香问道。

"Thinking," said Shinji. This was only partially true.

“思考，”真嗣说。但这只是部分事实。

"Thinking?" replied Asuka, her voice low, "do you honestly expect me to believe that for the past five days, you've been going outside and thinking? You were gone for hours tonight, so don't give me that bullshit about thinking."

“思考？”明日香低声回应，“你真以为我会相信过去五天你一直在外面思考？今晚你消失了几个小时，别再用思考这种鬼话糊弄我了。”

"What do you want me to say then?" asked Shinji. He was starting to get angry.

“那你到底想让我说什么？”真嗣问道。他开始有些生气了。

"I want you to be truthful damn it," retorted Asuka, her temper flaring up. "I want you to tell me whats been bothering you. You've told me so much already, and like you said before, not once have I ever treated you as a freak, or a monster. Whatever it is, you don't have to hide it from me Shinji."

"我要你实话实说，该死的，" 明日香反驳道，她的脾气爆发了。"我要你告诉我是什么在困扰你。你已经告诉了我那么多，就像你之前说的，我从未把你当成怪物或怪胎。不管是什么，你不必对我隐瞒，真嗣。"

"Maybe it's better that I don't tell you," Shinji rounded on her. "Maybe you're better off not even associating with me."

"也许我不告诉你更好，" 真嗣转向她。"也许你最好别和我扯上关系。"

Asuka felt herself lose patience then, and struck Shinji for the second time today, slapping him across the face.

明日香感到自己失去了耐心，今天第二次打了真嗣，一巴掌扇在了他的脸上。

"Don't you dare tell me that after everything we've been through together!" Asuka said, her entire body shaking in anger. "We've been stuck together for more than two fucking months now, and while living like this isn't ideal, we're still alive. If we didn't help each other when the building fell, we could have died from lack of oxygen. If I didn't help you when you couldn't walk, you could have starved, or became seriously dehydrated. If not for you, I may not have even been alive right now!"

"你敢告诉我，经历了这么多之后！" 明日香说，她的整个身体因愤怒而颤抖。"我们已经在一起被困了两个多月了，虽然这样的生活并不理想，但我们还活着。如果大楼倒塌时我们没有互相帮助，我们可能会因为缺氧而死。如果我没有在你不能走路时帮助你，你可能会饿死，或者严重脱水。如果不是因为你，我现在可能都不在人世了！"

Asuka shouted this last sentence, her voice cracking under the emotional distress. Never had she felt like this before, that she could feel this strongly about something.

明日香喊出最后这句话时，她的声音因情绪压力而破裂。她从未有过这样的感觉，对某件事能如此强烈地感受到。

"So don't say that. Don't say that I may be better of not associating with you. I don't care what you are, or what changes may happen to you; I'm not leaving you Shinji."

"所以不要这么说。不要说我可能不和你交往会更好。我不在乎你是什么，或者你可能会发生什么变化；我不会离开你的，真嗣。"

Though still in shock from Asuka slapping him again, Shinji did react when he heard Asuka say this. Shinji had learned over the course of their relationship, that Asuka had trouble expressing herself; he was no different of course, so he recognized this in her as well. What she just said though, Shinji had never imagined that those words could come out of her mouth. Certainly, it was almost an assumed notion, that they were better off together, but to actually hear this from Asuka...

尽管仍因明日香再次掌掴自己而震惊，但听到明日香如此说时，真嗣确实有了反应。在他们的关系中，真嗣了解到明日香在表达自己方面存在困难；当然，他自己也不例外，因此他也在她身上看到了这一点。然而，她刚才所说的话，真嗣从未想过会从她口中听到。诚然，他们在一起会更好几乎是不言而喻的，但亲耳听到明日香这么说……

"Well, say something idiot!"

“喂，说点什么啊，笨蛋！”

Asuka was still angry at him, but Shinji was having difficulties replying to her. What she said was astonishing, but the matter of his AT-field still loomed over him.

尽管明日香对他依然怒气未消，但真嗣却难以回应她的话。她的话语令人震惊，但他的 AT 力场问题仍旧悬而未决。

"Asuka, I-" "明日香，我——"

"What!? Spit it out already!"

"什么！？快说出来！"

"Can you calm down for a second?"

"你能冷静一下吗？"

"Oh, like you did in the kitchen earlier?" Asuka retorted sarcastically.

"哦，就像你之前在厨房那样？" 明日香讽刺地反驳道。

"That was different," said Shinji, shaking his head. "I was more angry at myself then you."

"那不一样，" 真嗣摇头说道，"我当时更多的是生自己的气，而不是你。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

Shinji didn't look at her, his mouth shut tightly.

真嗣没有看她，紧闭着嘴。

"I swear I'm going to hit you again if you don't start explaining things," Asuka began.

"我发誓如果你再不开始解释，我会再揍你一顿，" 明日香开口道。

"Don't you understand how difficult this is for me?" Shinji nearly shouted as he turned towards Asuka. "I've been going out there every night, trying to figure out who I fucking am, and worry that if I tell you, you'll reject me. I can't even...control it properly, even after these five days. I didn't even mean to break that glass, it just happened as I was washing it. My grip on it was too strong or-"

"你难道不明白这对我来说有多难吗？" 真嗣几乎是大声喊出来的，他转向明日香。"我每晚都出去，试图弄清楚我他妈的到底是谁，还担心如果我告诉你，你会拒绝我。我甚至无法……正确控制它，即使过了这五天。我根本没想打碎那只玻璃杯，只是洗的时候它就碎了。我的握力太强了，或者——"

'Or I used me AT-field without realizing it,' Shinji finished in his mind. Ultimately, this is what was really bothering him. He didn't feel like he used it, and neither did the flash of orange happen, but Shinji couldn't entirely rule it out. If he had used it unconsciously, by accident, because he lacked control; what if something worse had happened? What if he had hurt Asuka somehow?

'或者我不自觉地使用了 AT 力场，' 真嗣在心里完成了这句话。归根结底，这才是真正困扰他的问题。他并不觉得自己使用了它，也没有出现橙色的闪光，但真嗣不能完全排除这种可能性。如果他无意中使用了它，因为缺乏控制而意外地使用了；万一发生了更糟糕的事情怎么办？万一他伤害了明日香怎么办？

"Shinji, what are you talking about?" asked Asuka.

“真嗣，你在说什么呢？”明日香问道。

"Nothing, forget it," said Shinji, thoroughly finished with this conversation. Leaving the bed, he nearly reached the doorway, before he was stopped by Asuka again. She had jumped off the bed, leaving the warmth of the covers, and grabbed onto his wrist.

“没什么，别在意，”真嗣彻底结束了这场对话。他离开床铺，几乎要走到门口时，又被明日香拦住了。她从床上跳下来，离开了被窝的温暖，抓住了他的手腕。

"Let go of me," said Shinji. "I'm done talking."

“放开我，”真嗣说道，“我不想再谈了。”

"Well I'm not!" shouted Asuka.

"我当然不是！" 明日香喊道。

"Damn it Asuka, leave me alone!"

"该死的明日香，别烦我！"

"No, you stupid bastard!"

"不，你这个蠢货！"

Shinji had had enough. Grabbing Asuka's hand that was gripping his wrist, he tried shaking her off, but she refused to let go.

真嗣已经受够了。他抓住明日香紧握他手腕的手，试图甩开她，但她坚决不松手。

"Stop that Shinji!" “别这样，真嗣！”

"Then let go of me!"

“那就放开我！”

They battled like that, back and forth for half a minute, but Shinji was beginning to lose control over his anger. Tugging on his own arm that Asuka was still gripping, he finally pulled away from her, but succeeded in slamming backwards into the wall behind him. Slightly dazed, he looked up, just in time to see Asuka approaching him. He thought that she was going to hit him again, but what she did instead shocked him. Standing over him, Asuka crouched down so low that she was almost sitting in his lap, and placed her face directly in front of his. Their noses were now touching, and their eyes were directly level with each other. Shinji could feel Asuka's ragged breath blowing onto his face, clearly tired from their fight. What was she going to-

他们就这样你来我往地打了半分钟，但真嗣开始逐渐失去对愤怒的控制。他用力拉扯被明日香紧握的手臂，终于挣脱了她，却也因此重重地撞到了身后的墙上。有些晕眩的他抬头一看，正好看到明日香向他走来。他以为她又要打他，但她接下来的举动让他震惊。明日香蹲下身来，几乎要坐到他的腿上，将脸直接凑到他的面前。两人的鼻子相触，眼睛直视对方。真嗣能感受到明日香因打斗而急促的呼吸吹拂在脸上，显然她也很疲惫。她到底要做什么——

"Why can't you just trust me idiot!"

“你为什么就不能相信我这个笨蛋！”

Shinji opened his eyes wide as she made this statement; Asuka was smiling in a sad manner. Her lip seemed to be trembling slightly, and her clear eyes were starting to glisten with tears. In the more than two months that Shinji had known her, not once had he seen Asuka cry. A part of him thought that she was incapable of crying, or that she was just never sad over anything. To be crying over this, and for his sake.

真嗣听到这话睁大了眼睛；明日香带着悲伤的微笑。她的嘴唇似乎在微微颤抖，清澈的双眼开始泛起泪光。在认识她的两个多月里，真嗣从未见过明日香哭泣。他一度以为她不会哭，或者她从不为任何事感到悲伤。而此刻，她却为了这件事，为了他而流泪。

"Why wont you just listen damn it!" shouted Asuka, her fist pounding against his chest. Shinji hardly felt this, his gaze fixated on Asuka's face, the tears slowing rolling down her cheeks; he had made her cry.

“你为什么就是不听呢，该死！”明日香喊道，拳头重重地捶打在他的胸口。真嗣几乎感觉不到这力度，他的目光紧锁在明日香的脸上，泪水缓缓滑过她的脸颊；他让她哭了。

Was he this insecure with himself, that he couldn't trust her? Time and time again, Asuka had demonstrated that she could be trusted, but Shinji was still afraid of that rejection. His father had abandoned him as a child, he never had any friends, and was fundamentally unable to socially interact with people. He didn't want what he had with Asuka to suddenly disappear. The notion of his AT-field was too strong in his own mind, that he couldn't trust Asuka to not reject him, because he had rejected himself at the outset. This was his problem. But seeing Asuka crying in front him, someone who he had never seen cry before, and was now crying for his sake: Shinji felt like the lowest piece of shit ever.

他对自己如此缺乏安全感，以至于无法信任她吗？一次又一次，明日香已经证明了她值得信赖，但真嗣仍然害怕被拒绝。他的父亲在他童年时就抛弃了他，他从未有过朋友，根本无法与他人进行社交互动。他不希望与明日香之间的关系突然消失。他内心深处对 AT 力场的概念太过强烈，以至于他无法相信明日香不会拒绝他，因为他从一开始就拒绝了自己。这是他的问题。但看到明日香在他面前哭泣，一个他从未见过的哭泣的人，现在却为了他而哭泣：真嗣觉得自己简直是世界上最糟糕的混蛋。

Asuka's fist pounded against his chest again, and this awoke him from this brief reprieve. He was aware of the girl crying in front of him.

明日香的拳头再次重重地击打在他的胸口，这让他从短暂的喘息中惊醒。他意识到眼前的女孩正在哭泣。

"Why? Why am I crying over your stupid self. Why do I have to cry because you're an idiot! I hate this!" Asuka shouted as she glared back at Shinji, her tears still streaming down her face. She didn't even understand why she was crying. It didn't make any sense to her.

“为什么？为什么我要为你这个笨蛋哭泣。为什么我得因为你是个傻瓜而哭！我讨厌这样！”明日香一边怒视着真嗣，一边大喊，泪水依旧顺着她的脸颊流淌。她甚至不明白自己为何哭泣。这对她来说毫无意义。

"...Asuka..." mumbled Shinji.

"...明日香..." 真嗣喃喃道。

She hit him again. 她又打了他一巴掌。

"Asuka." "明日香。"

She struck him twice more.

她又狠狠地打了他的两下。

"Asu-"

"What you stupid idio-" “你这个蠢——”

Asuka was cut off, as Shinji wrapped his arms around her back, and pulled her closer to him. Her chin was now resting on his shoulder, and even her tears seemed to pause after Shinji had done this. Asuka blinked several times, confused about this sudden warmth shared between them.

话未说完，真嗣便用双臂环抱住她的后背，将她拉近自己。她的下巴靠在他的肩上，连泪水似乎都在真嗣这么做后暂停了。明日香眨了几次眼，对这突如其来的温暖感到困惑。

"Shinji wha-" but Asuka stopped as she heard Shinji say two words.

"真嗣什么——" 但听到真嗣说出两个字，明日香突然停住了。

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

Thinking that she misheard, Asuka opened her mouth to say something, but Shinji beat her to it.

明日香以为自己听错了，正要开口说些什么，但真嗣抢先了一步。

"I'm sorry Asuka, I'm really sorry. I was being stupid."

"对不起，明日香，真的很对不起。我那时太蠢了。"

Asuka would have dearly liked to say, 'You're damn right you were,' but she held her voice back. Right now, assigning blame wasn't the right thing to do. Right now, she was just glad they had come to reason. Though she didn't hear anything else from Shinji, she did feel a certain moistness fall onto her shoulder; it seemed Shinji was crying as well.

明日香本想说：‘你说的没错，你确实错了。’但她忍住了。现在，追究责任并不是正确的事。此刻，她只是庆幸他们终于理智了。虽然她没再听到真嗣说什么，但她确实感觉到有湿润的东西落在她的肩上；看来真嗣也在哭泣。

They sat like that for several seconds, in each others arms, until Asuka broke off the contact, a small blush on her face. Shinji's back was still against the door, but he wasn't looking at Asuka, he was looking up at the ceiling.

他们就这样相拥了几秒钟，直到明日香打破了沉默，脸上泛起一丝红晕。真嗣的背依旧靠在门上，但他没有看明日香，而是抬头望着天花板。

"Shinji-" “真嗣——”

"I'll tell you tomorrow," stated Shinji.

“我明天再告诉你，”真嗣说道。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"I'll explain everything to you tomorrow," elaborated Shinji.

"我明天会向你解释一切，" 真嗣详细地说道。

"Why tomorrow?" asked Asuka. You couldn't blame her for being skeptical after everything that had transpired today.

"为什么是明天？" 明日香问道。经历了今天发生的所有事情，你不能怪她持怀疑态度。

"Because explaining it doesn't cut it; I have to show you as well, otherwise there isn't any meaning."

"因为光解释不够；我必须展示给你看，否则就没有意义。"

Asuka decided to believe him. The tone in Shinji's voice was different than earlier. He was more sure of himself now.

明日香决定相信他。真嗣的语气与之前不同了。他现在更加自信了。

"Okay," nodded Asuka. "好吧，"明日香点头道。"

Standing up, she reached out her hand and pulled Shinji up. They stood like that for several more seconds, staring back at each other until Asuka said, "I'm going to bed," and returned to her own room. Shinji watched her go, until her figured disappeared behind her closed door. Returning to his own bed, he found it much harder to fall asleep, even though he felt tired. He couldn't say things had been patched up with Asuka, but he was no longer worried about showing his AT-field to her.

她站起身，伸出手将真嗣拉了起来。两人就这样对视了几秒，直到明日香开口：“我要去睡了。”随后回到了自己的房间。真嗣目送她离去，直到她的身影消失在紧闭的房门后。回到自己的床上，他发现自己更难入睡，尽管感到疲惫。虽然与明日香的关系并未完全修复，但他不再担心在她面前展现自己的 AT 力场。

'Whatever happens tomorrow, happens I suppose,' thought Shinji.

"不管明天发生什么，就让它发生吧，我想。" 真嗣心想。

Rolling into the spot where Asuka had been sleeping, Shinji noticed that her warmth was still there, and laid there for several seconds before rolling back to the other side. It was almost like her presence could still be felt, sleeping beside him.

滚到明日香曾经睡过的地方，真嗣察觉到她的余温犹存，便在那里躺了几秒钟，然后又滚回另一侧。仿佛她的存在感依旧，就在他身旁沉睡。

The next day dawned, Friday, and Shinji and Asuka's attitude towards each other was mild. Neither had forgotten the row the night before, and neither did they forget what was transpiring that night. Shinji told Asuka that morning after breakfast, then after the sun set, he would show her what he had been doing.

次日清晨，星期五，真嗣和明日香对彼此的态度都温和了许多。尽管前一晚的争执未曾忘却，今晚即将发生的事也铭记于心。早餐后，真嗣告诉明日香，待太阳落山后，他会展示自己一直在忙的事情。

With this in mind, they passed the day absorbed in their own thoughts, each doing their own thing, until dinner arrived. Having enough pasta to make spaghetti again, Shinji did just that, not in the mood to come up with something else. They ate dinner in silence and alone, Shinji in the dining room, and Asuka on the couch. Even though they were only one room away, it felt much further. After Shinji washed the dishes, he walked upstairs to Asuka's room. She had retreated up there after dinner, and Shinji knocked on her door before entering.

带着这样的念头，他们各自沉浸在自己的思绪中，各做各的事，直到晚餐时分。真嗣再次煮了足够多的意大利面，没有心情去想别的菜式。他们默默地独自用餐，真嗣在餐厅，明日香则在沙发上。尽管只隔了一间房，却感觉相距甚远。洗完碗后，真嗣走上楼，来到明日香的房间。晚餐后她便躲进了这里，真嗣敲了敲门，然后走了进去。

"Ready?" asked Shinji as he entered her room. He had only been in here a handful of times, but nothing drastic had changed.

“准备好了吗？” 真嗣走进她的房间问道。他只来过这里几次，但并没有发生什么大的变化。

"Yeah," nodded Asuka, who was sitting on the edge of her bed, dressed down in full winter gear. She had been waiting for him afterall.

“嗯，” 明日香点头道，她坐在床边，穿着全套的冬装。毕竟，她一直在等他。

They walked downstairs, Shinji leading, and paused at the front door for Shinji to put on a jacket. Opening the front door, they were greeted by a flurry of snow. It had continued snowing since last night, and they were close to a foot of snow now. Trudging down the front steps, being careful not to slip, Shinji led Asuka out into the middle of the street, and began walking towards the end of the block, where he usually practiced.

他们一起下楼，真嗣走在前面，并在前门停下让真嗣穿上夹克。打开前门，迎接他们的是一阵纷飞的雪花。从昨晚开始雪就一直下，现在积雪已近一英尺厚。小心翼翼地走下前门台阶，以防滑倒，真嗣领着明日香走到街道中央，开始向街区尽头走去，那是他通常练习的地方。

"What are you expecting?" asked Shinji, even surprising himself that he would ask that.

“你在期待什么？”真嗣问道，连他自己都惊讶会问出这样的话。

"I've no idea," answered Asuka truthfully. Because she honestly didn't know, she was beginning to grow worried. What was it that had bothered Shinji so much? Was it truly that dreadful?

"我不知道，" 明日香如实回答。因为她真的不知道，开始感到担忧。是什么让真嗣如此困扰？真的有那么糟糕吗？

Reaching the end of the street, they both paused, now side by side. Down the street to the right, was the street light that Shinji had passed under last night, and on the opposite side, was more side streets with neighborhoods.

走到街道尽头，两人都停了下来，并肩而立。右边街道的尽头，是昨晚真嗣经过的那盏路灯，对面则是更多的巷弄和住宅区。

Shivering slightly, Asuka looked over at Shinji but was surprised that he was looking back at her.

明日香微微颤抖，转头看向真嗣，却惊讶地发现他也在看着她。

"What?" asked Asuka. "什么？" 明日香问道。

"No...nothing, "said Shinji as he shook his head. Next, he took a deep breath and said, "Wait right here, and don't approach me under any circumstances. I don't know...what'll happen to another human if they approach me too closely."

"不...没什么，" 真嗣摇着头说。接着，他深吸了一口气，说道："就在这里等着，无论如何都不要靠近我。我不知道...如果有人靠得太近，会发生什么。"

"Shinji, what do you-" "真嗣，你到底在说什么-"

"Asuka, I need you to promise me. I don't want anything to happen to you because...because I can't fully control it."

"明日香，我需要你答应我。我不希望你出事，因为...因为我无法完全控制它。"

Seeing how adamant he was, and the look in his eyes which was set, Asuka nodded her head.

看到他如此坚决，以及他眼中坚定的神情，明日香点了点头。

"I promise." "我答应你。"

Giving her a small smile, Shinji began walking into the middle of the street; it felt like the farthest he had ever walked. Reaching the middle, he removed his hands which were inside his jacket pocket, and let them hang at his side. Looking over his shoulder, he spoke briefly to Asuka.

给了她一个浅浅的微笑，真嗣开始走向街道中央；这感觉像是他走过的最远距离。到达中间时，他从夹克口袋里抽出手，任它们垂在身侧。回头望了一眼，他简短地对明日香说道。

"What I'm about to do, is probably something you've already seen before at Nerv."

“我要做的这件事，可能在 NERV 你已经见过了。”

"At Nerv? Why would I have seen it there?" asked Asuka, completely puzzled. What was Shinji doing?

“在 NERV？我怎么会在那里见过它？”明日香完全困惑了。真嗣在做什么？

He didn't reply however, but instead seem to compose himself, almost like he was thinking deeply about something. Without giving any notification, Shinji swung his arm violently upward, and a flash of orange erupted above him. It was impossible to mistake it for anything else, because Asuka had seen it many times before now. Evangelion Unit 02, her Evangelion unit, how many times did she practice this at Gehern. She instinctively knew this phenomenon, which most people would have cowered before.

然而，他没有回答，反而似乎在整理思绪，就像在深思熟虑什么。没有发出任何通知，真嗣猛地向上挥动手臂，一道橙色的光芒在他上方爆发。这不可能认错，因为明日香已经见过很多次了。这是她的 EVA 二号机，她在格赫恩练习过多少次。她本能地知道这种现象，大多数人可能会因此退缩。

"An AT-field," whispered Asuka.

"一个 AT 力场，" 明日香低声说道。

Shinji had materialized his AT-field, projecting it above him and molding it into the basic wall that was standard for the Evangelions, and the Angels. He didn't know this, but it was well known to Asuka, and many who she had worked with. An AT-field, an absolute defense barrier; she couldn't believe she was witness this directly in front of her, from a human, and Shinji no less. But looking at Shinji, she realized that something was wrong.

真嗣已经激活了他的 AT 力场，将其投射在头顶上方，塑造成使徒和 EVA 常用的基本屏障墙。他对此并不知情，但这对明日香以及她共事过的许多人来说却是常识。AT 力场，绝对防御屏障；她难以置信自己能亲眼目睹这一幕，而且是由人类，还是真嗣展现出来的。但看着真嗣，她意识到有些不对劲。

The sheer amount of energy the AT-field was putting off was driving Shinji backwards, making his feet slide across the snow. The powdery snow around him began to billow, being tossed in the air by the force of the AT-field. Shinji didn't look like he could hold it much longer, and next second, he was forced to dissipate the AT-field, before falling to one knee. The minute this happened, Asuka ran towards him.

AT 力场所释放的巨大能量正将真嗣向后推，使他的双脚在雪地上滑行。他周围的粉状雪开始翻腾，被 AT 力场的力量抛向空中。真嗣看起来支撑不了多久，下一秒，他被迫消散了 AT 力场，随即单膝跪地。这一刻刚发生，明日香便朝他跑去。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

He turned towards her, and she paused in her tracks.

他转向她，她便停下了脚步。

"Can you consider me anything but a freak after seeing that?"

"你看到这些后，还能把我当成正常人吗？"

"I wasn't going to say anything like that," said Asuka as she stared back at him.

"我本来就没打算那么说，" 明日香回瞪着他。"

Laughing bitterly, and very unlike himself, Shinji said, "How can you not think I'm a freak. I'm a human that has an AT-field."

苦笑着，这与他平时的样子大相径庭，真嗣说道："你怎么可能不觉得我是怪物。我可是拥有 AT 力场的人类。"

"Don't call yourself a freak, and how did you know that was an AT-field?"

别自称怪胎，你怎么知道那是 AT 力场的？

"You told me about them back in Tokyo-3 when you were telling me everything about Nerv, the Evangelions, and the Angels."

“你在东京-3 时跟我讲过他们，那时你把关于 NERV、EVA 和使徒的一切都告诉了我。”

"Yes, but I don't remember telling you what an AT-field looked like. How did you know it was that though?"

“是的，但我记不得跟你描述过 AT 力场是什么样子。你是怎么知道是那样的呢？”

Shinji looked back at her before resigning himself to the entire story. He told her about the dream he had almost a week ago now, and how his other self had demonstrated the AT-field, explaining how they were both the same person, with the same abilities. Shinji left out the red eyes however.

真嗣回头看了她一眼，然后无奈地决定将整个故事和盘托出。他向她讲述了大约一周前做的那个梦，以及另一个自己如何展示了 AT 力场，解释了他们如何同为一人，拥有相同的能力。然而，他并未提及那双红眼睛。

"And all this happened in a dream?" asked Asuka.

“这一切都发生在一个梦里？”明日香问道。

"At the time, I thought it was utter nonsense, but I realized that what my other self said was true. Ever since the buildings collapse, and when my leg was regenerating, I've been getting these...feelings, that I couldn't explain. I now know that it was my AT-field I was feeling the whole time, but that I just didn't have a strong grasp on it like I do now."

“当时，我以为那完全是胡说八道，但我意识到我另一个自我说的话是真的。自从大楼倒塌，我的腿再生以来，我一直有这些……感觉，我无法解释。我现在知道，那一直是我在感受我的 AT 力场，只是当时我还没有像现在这样牢牢掌握它。”

"And you kept these feelings from me, all the way until now?" mumbled Asuka.

“而你一直把这些感觉瞒着我，直到现在？”明日香喃喃道。

"I didn't think it was important at the time," replied Shinji. "Looks like I was wrong."

"我当时没觉得这很重要，" 真嗣回答道，"看来是我错了。"

"I wish you would have told me this sooner, instead of waiting until now," said Asuka as she crossed her arms.

"我真希望你早点告诉我，而不是等到现在，" 明日香说着，交叉双臂。"

"I take it, you aren't afraid of me then?" asked Shinji.

"这么说，你不怕我？" 真嗣问道。"

"How can you ask that, knowing who I am?" Asuka almost laughed. Shinji hadn't expected this response.

"你明知道我是谁，怎么还能问出这种问题？" 明日香几乎要笑出声来。真嗣没想到她会这样回答。

"Not once have I treated you differently because of who you are. Don't forget Shinji, that I was an Evangelion pilot before all this, and that I used an AT-field myself. Granted, it was my Evangelions, but I still controlled it. I practiced with my Unit 02 until I was the best pilot possible. If it was anybody else that was here, instead of me, they probably wouldn't know what to do. Yes you're different, and yes it is strange that you have an AT-field when you are in fact human, but that doesn't change who you are. So no, I'm not afraid of you, and that won't ever happen."

"我从未因为你是谁而对你另眼相待。别忘了，真嗣，在这之前我已经是 EVA 的驾驶员了，我自己也使用过 AT 力场。虽然那是我的 EVA，但我依然能操控它。我与二号机一同训练，直到成为可能的最佳驾驶员。如果换作别人在这里，而不是我，他们可能根本不知道该怎么办。没错，你是与众不同，没错，你身为人类却拥有 AT 力场确实奇怪，但这并不改变你是谁。所以不，我不怕你，这种情况永远不会发生。"

"Answer me this then Asuka," said Shinji, "why do I have this AT-field in the first place. Did Nerv do some terrible experiment on my body, and I'm like this now because of that...or am I in fact an Angel?"

"那么，回答我，明日香，" 真嗣说道，"为什么我会有这个 AT 力场。是 NERV 对我做了什么可怕的实验，我现在变成这样是因为那个...还是说，我实际上是一个使徒？"

Asuka wouldn't have expected this question from Shinji, and didn't have an answer for him. But what she had seen earlier...

明日香没想到真嗣会问这个问题，她也没有答案给他。但她之前看到的...

"An Angel? How could you possibly be an Angel? You're human. You tire, you eat, you sleep. I don't think an Angel does any of those things," she scoffed.

"一个天使？你怎么可能是个天使？你是人类。你会疲惫，会进食，会睡眠。我不认为天使会做这些事。" 她嗤之以鼻。

"You don't know that," replied Shinji.

“你不知道的，”真嗣回答道。

"No, I don't," shrugged Asuka, "but if you were, what then?"

"不，我不是，" 明日香耸了耸肩，"但如果你是，那又怎样？"

Shinji didn't know, and didn't have an answer to that either. If he really was an Angel, what would happen? As somebody who used to pilot the Evangelions, would it be Asuka's duty to kill him?

真嗣不知道，也没有答案。如果他真的是使徒，会发生什么？作为曾经驾驶过 EVA 的人，这是否意味着明日香的职责是杀了他？

"Can we go back? I can't feel my hands anymore," complained Asuka.

"我们能回去吗？我的手都感觉不到了，" 明日香抱怨道。"

"Thats it then?" mumbled Shinji. "What about my lack of control?"

"就这样了吗？" 真嗣咕哝道。"那我对失控的问题怎么办？"

"You'll sort it out eventually I'm sure. Thats what you've been doing this whole time isn't it, practicing?"

"我相信你最终会解决的。你这段时间不一直在练习吗，不是吗？"

"I didn't want to show it to you without understanding it myself."

"我不想在没有自己理解的情况下就展示给你看。"

"You worry too much," groaned Asuka.

"你担心过头了，" 明日香抱怨道。

"Can you blame me?" "这能怪我吗？"

"Yes, I can," smirked Asuka as she turned away from him, and began walking back towards their house. Shinji watched her retreating back, wondering how she could be so nonchalant about this. He was glad that she was understanding like this however.

"当然可以怪你，" 明日香微微一笑，转身离开他，开始走回他们的家。真嗣望着她远去的背影，疑惑她怎么能对此如此漠不关心。不过，他很高兴她能这样理解他。

As Shinji left the street, and began hurrying after her, Asuka was already halfway to their house. She was thinking about what she had just witnessed. It had been a great shock to her, and she would be lying if she didn't acknowledge her worry about this. She trusted Shinji, and knew that he could make it through this, and she would be supporting him as he did, but still-

当真嗣离开街道，开始匆忙追赶她时，明日香已经走到了回家的半路上。她正回想着刚刚目睹的一切。那对她来说是个巨大的打击，如果不承认自己的担忧，那她就是在撒谎。她信任真嗣，知道他能挺过这一关，而她也会在他这么做时支持他，但即便如此——

She couldn't shake this feeling of worry, but maybe some of that was attributed to when Shinji had looked at her initially. Even now, his blood red eyes that had stared back at her then, unnerved her even now. The AT-field was one thing, but why were his eyes red? Shortly afterwards of course, they had returned to the normal brown, but she still thought about that image. Was it his AT-field which had changed them briefly? There didn't seem to be any other reason.

她无法摆脱这种担忧的感觉，但或许部分原因在于真嗣最初看她的眼神。即便现在，他那双当时回望着她的血红色眼睛，仍让她感到不安。AT 力场是一回事，但为什么他的眼睛是红色的？当然，不久后它们就恢复了正常的棕色，但她仍然会想起那个画面。是他的 AT 力场短暂地改变了它们吗？似乎没有其他解释了。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Hmm?" asked Asuka as she turned towards Shinji who had finally caught up.

“嗯？”明日香转过身来，问道，此时真嗣终于追上了她。

"Thank you for, well-" “谢谢你，嗯——”

"You don't have to thank me Shinji," said Asuka as she cut him off. "Besides, I've had enough surprises for one day. I just want to return home and warm up by the fire now."

"你不必谢我，真嗣，" 明日香打断他说道，"再说，我今天已经受够了惊喜。现在只想回家，在炉火旁暖和一下。"

"If you say so," said Shinji, grinning briefly.

"既然你这么说，" 真嗣短暂地笑了笑。

They returned home, and spent the remaining hours sitting in front of the fireplace. They talked about many things, but never touched on the subject of Shinji's AT-field; both seemed to silently agree that that was best left for another time. Eventually, Asuka grew tired, and bade Shinji goodnight before going upstairs to her bedroom, falling asleep almost immediately. Shinji spent longer downstairs, but felt the call of his bed at one point, and left the living room, letting the fire die down in the night.

他们回到家，在壁炉前度过了剩下的时光。他们聊了许多事情，但从未触及真嗣的 AT 力场这一话题；两人似乎都默默同意，最好留待以后再谈。最终，明日香感到疲倦，向真嗣道了晚安后便上楼回卧室，几乎立刻就睡着了。真嗣在楼下多待了一会儿，但最终也感到困意袭来，离开了客厅，让炉火在夜里渐渐熄灭。

He had finally overcome that hurtle, and for better, or for worse, he had told Asuka. Whichever one, only time would tell.

他终于跨过了那道坎，不论结果是好是坏，他已向明日香坦白。究竟如何，唯有时间能证明。

### Chapter 16: Uncertainty

Well, I'm three for three so far on getting these out, and I can tell you that they're wearing me down a bit. Still, lets continue this pace until the end of the month. Also, I'm gonna be release a chapter on the 24th, and then again on the following day. I may decide to release one on new years as well, but it depends on tired I am by the time I finish these last two chapters.

好吧，到目前为止我已经完成了三篇，可以告诉你这让我有点疲惫。不过，让我们继续保持这个节奏直到月底。另外，我将在 24 号发布一篇chapter，然后在第二天再发布一篇。我可能会在新年也发布一篇，但这取决于我完成最后两章时的疲劳程度。

Several days had passed since Shinji had shown Asuka his AT-field, and now it was the following Wednesday, five days since that time. Shinji continued practicing every night, and was occasionally watched by Asuka. While Shinji didn't say this, he was grateful that she was keeping him company out in the cold like this. She didn't have to, and nor was she obligated, and would probably have preferred staying inside where it was warm, but she still stayed with him.

自从真嗣向明日香展示他的 AT 力场以来，已经过去了好几天，现在是接下来的周三，距离那时已经五天了。真嗣每晚都在练习，偶尔被明日香注视着。虽然真嗣没有说出口，但他很感激她在这寒冷的夜晚陪伴他。她没有必要这样做，也没有义务，她可能更愿意待在温暖的室内，但她仍然陪在他身边。

Throughout this, improving his control over his AT-field was no easy matter. However he was before, when he had full grasp over it, his self now couldn't imagine what he had gone through to get to the point of controlling something this powerful. Was some sort of trauma the key, like a strong emotional reaction? Shinji was aware that he seemed to get angry without even realizing it, and constantly had to keep his anger in check. He was sure that Asuka had realized this as well, but she didn't say anything. She just silently watched him from afar, or waited until he returned home.

在这过程中，提升对 AT 力场的控制并非易事。无论他曾经如何完全掌握它，现在的自己已无法想象当初经历了什么才达到控制如此强大力量的地步。是否某种创伤才是关键，如同强烈的情感反应？真嗣意识到自己似乎常常在不经意间发怒，并需不断克制怒火。他确信明日香也注意到了这一点，但她并未言明。她只是默默地从远处注视着他，或等待他回家。

With only ten more days to go until Christmas, Shinji was starting to become more aware of his surroundings. During the days when Asuka didn't watch him practice, Shinji would take it upon himself to walk a few miles after he was done. He enjoyed these walks, as it reminded him of his brief time in Tokyo-3 before all this happened, but it was more than that. During these walks, he made it a point to check the houses that he passed. He knew that Christmas was approaching quickly, and that he hadn't found anything for Asuka yet. He checked several houses before he went home, but could never find anything which he thought she may like. Shinji wondered how Asuka's search was going, since he had seen her leaving the houses sometimes during the day, but never quite saying where she was going. He suspected she was having similar difficulties, just as he was.

随着圣诞节仅剩十天之遥，真嗣开始更加留意周围的环境。在明日香不监督他练习的日子里，真嗣会主动在结束后步行几英里。他享受这些散步，因为这让他回想起一切发生前在第三新东京市的短暂时光，但这不仅仅是怀旧。在这些散步中，他特意留意沿途的房屋。他知道圣诞节即将来临，而自己还未为明日香找到任何礼物。他检查了多处房屋才回家，却始终找不到他认为她会喜欢的东西。真嗣好奇明日香的搜寻进展如何，因为他曾见她白天有时从屋子里出来，却从未明确说她去哪儿了。他猜想她或许也遇到了类似的困难，正如他所经历的那样。

Shinji awoke earlier that morning than he had in the past few days. Because he had been practicing every night to the point of exhaustion, he had recently been sleeping in. Last night was no different of course, but as for this morning, he just wanted to spend some time walking around. So, after eating his own breakfast, and leaving a note for Asuka, letting her know that he had gone out, he stepped through the front door, and out into the white snow.

那天早晨，真嗣比过去几天醒得更早。由于每晚都练习到筋疲力尽，他最近总是睡过头。当然，昨晚也不例外，但今天早上，他只想四处走走。于是，吃完自己的早餐后，他给明日香留了张字条，告诉她自己出门了，然后踏出前门，走进了皑皑白雪中。

It had continually snowed, on and off the past few days, and twice now, Shinji had to shovel snow out of the way, just so he could get through the front door. Thankfully, it didn't seem to snow much last night, so Shinji was saved the trouble of this. Walking down the driveway, he paused at the end, and looked up towards the sky. It was a miraculous blue, and he had nearly forgotten what that looked like. It was still cold out, but for today at least, they didn't have to worry about new snow.

过去几天里，雪断断续续地下着，已经有两次，真嗣不得不铲开积雪才能打开前门。幸运的是，昨晚似乎没怎么下雪，真嗣因此免去了这个麻烦。他沿着车道走下去，在尽头停下，抬头望向天空。天空呈现出一种奇迹般的蓝色，他几乎忘记了那是什么样子。外面依然寒冷，但至少今天，他们不必担心新雪的降临。

Beginning on his way, he treaded the familiar path he took every night when he practiced with his AT-field. Reaching the end of the block, he turned left, crossing the street and continued down the road. This was only his third time searching for some sort of present for Asuka, but even now, he had to walk down several blocks before he reached those houses he hadn't searched yet.

他踏上了熟悉的道路，每晚练习 AT 力场时都会走这条路。走到街区尽头，他向左转，穿过街道继续前行。这已经是他第三次为明日香寻找礼物了，即便如此，他还是得走过几个街区，才能到达那些他尚未搜寻过的房子。

Shinji would be lying if didn't admit that he was frustrated about this; practicing with his AT-field was easy enough, even if he didn't see much progress. Finding a present for Asuka now seemed an even more daunting task. When it got right down to it, Shinji didn't know what Asuka liked. Throughout their travels together, he couldn't remember one specific time where she mentioned something that she liked, or wanted. Asuka could be selfish at times, but she wasn't unreasonable, and understood that what they needed, was entirely different compared to what they wanted. Shinji wished that Asuka would have expressed her wants more often though, at least then he'd have some inkling as to what she might like.

真嗣若不承认对此感到沮丧，那他就是在撒谎；用 AT 力场练习还算容易，尽管他并未看到太多进步。如今要为明日香挑选礼物，似乎成了更加艰巨的任务。说到底，真嗣并不清楚明日香喜欢什么。在他们的共同旅程中，他记不起有哪一次她明确提到过自己喜欢或想要的东西。明日香有时可能很自私，但她并不无理取闹，明白他们需要的与想要的东西截然不同。真嗣只希望明日香能更常表达自己的愿望，那样至少他还能有些头绪，知道她可能会喜欢什么。

The other two times he had done this, he had been through so many houses, that they all blended together. Though it had been dark at the time, Shinji's eyes didn't seem to have much problems adjusting to the dim lighting, and he attributed this to his AT-field, or whatever property made up who he was. He didn't feel awkward anymore when he went through the drawers of the deceased, and sometimes even eagerly did this. Jewelry was the thing he found the most, but he had a hard time imagining Asuka wearing even a necklace in this After Impact world. With jewelry out of the question, his mind turned to other things, each seeming more pointless than the last. Today, he hoped that things would be different however.

另外两次他这么做时，已经穿梭过太多房屋，以至于它们都混为一体了。尽管当时天色昏暗，真嗣的眼睛似乎并无太大困难适应这微弱的光线，他将此归功于自己的 AT 力场，或是构成他本质的某种特性。如今，翻找逝者抽屉时他不再感到尴尬，有时甚至带着几分热切。他找到最多的便是珠宝，但很难想象在这个后冲击世界里，明日香会佩戴哪怕一条项链。既然珠宝不在考虑之列，他的思绪转向了其他物品，每一样都显得比前一件更无意义。然而今天，他期盼情况会有所不同。

Passing the fourth block from his own, he turned onto the next, his eyes focused on the first house at the corner. It was a single story, with an adjacent garage and driveway. Walking up the driveway, he reached the front door, and kicked at it without a second thought. His foot connected with the doorknob, and the door was immediately forced open, bouncing off the wall until Shinji caught it. In the past, it normally took him several attempts to break into a house, but his physical strength wasn't what it used to be. The breaking of the glass was an early sign of this, but Shinji had become aware of it now.

从自家数起的第四个街区经过后，他拐入下一条街道，目光紧锁在街角的第一个房子上。那是一栋单层住宅，附带一个车库和车道。他沿着车道走近前门，毫不犹豫地一脚踹去。脚尖正中门把手，门应声而开，撞上墙壁后被真嗣一把抓住。以往，他通常需要多次尝试才能破门而入，但他的体力已大不如前。玻璃的破碎便是一个早期信号，而如今真嗣对此已有所察觉。

Stepping through the broken door, Shinji's feet connected with a hardwood floor. On the wall to his right, was an electric fireplace, and opposite of that, was a single couch, tables on either side. Ignoring this living room, Shinji walking further into the house, passing through the kitchen and found a door that led down into a basement. Passing over this for now, he returned to the living room, and walked down a nearby hallway, entering the master bedroom.

踏过破损的门，真嗣的双脚触到了硬木地板。右侧的墙上挂着一台电壁炉，对面则摆着一张单人沙发，两侧各有一张桌子。真嗣并未在此停留，而是继续深入屋内，穿过厨房，发现了一扇通往地下室的门。他暂时忽略了这个入口，回到客厅，沿着附近的走廊走去，进入了主卧室。

A middle aged woman lived her, by herself apparently...or was that right? Glancing at the dresser across from the bed, several photos of the woman with another man were visible. As Shinji began to go through the dresser, he immediately noticed a distinct lack of male clothes. Was the woman dating the guy, or had he died, and she was now a widow? Shinji puzzled over this for several seconds, before realizing it didn't matter. As sad as it was to say, this persons life was irrelevant to him. She could have been the mistress to the governor of Tokyo-2, and it still wouldn't have mattered to him.

一位中年妇女独自居住于此，显然如此...还是我记错了？瞥向床对面的梳妆台，几张女人与另一名男子的合照映入眼帘。当真嗣开始翻找梳妆台时，他立刻注意到明显缺少男性衣物。这位女士是在和那男人交往，还是他已经离世，而她成了寡妇？真嗣对此困惑了几秒钟，随即意识到这并不重要。尽管说来令人伤感，这个人的生活与他无关。她可能是东京-2 州长的情妇，对他来说依然无关紧要。

After going through the entire bedroom, turning it upside down, Shinji decided that there was nothing here for him. As he was about to leave though, he figured he may as well check the basement. If he left now, when there could be something down there; it was the prospect of something being there which drove Shinji downstairs.

在将整个卧室翻了个底朝天后，真嗣断定这里没有什么值得他留下的东西。然而，就在他准备离开之际，他觉得不妨也检查一下地下室。如果现在离开，而那里可能藏有什么东西；正是这种可能性驱使真嗣下楼去探个究竟。

It was significantly darker down here, devoid of any sunlight, and it took Shinji's eyes half a minute to adjust before he was able to see properly. A long hallway stretched out before him, with several doors on either side. To his right, was an opening that had both a washing machine, and a dryer, but nothing else in the room served much purpose. At the far end of the hallway, was a door, but Shinji chose to enter the opening to his left instead.

这里明显更暗，没有一丝阳光，真嗣花了半分钟时间才让眼睛适应，得以看清周围。一条长长的走廊展现在他面前，两侧各有几扇门。右边有一个开口，里面有一台洗衣机和烘干机，但房间里其他东西似乎都没什么用处。走廊尽头有一扇门，但真嗣选择先进左边的那扇门。

It was a study of sorts, with a large bookcase covering an entire wall, and stuffed full of many books. Shinji glanced at this for a full minute, before turning his gaze towards the desk in the center of the room. A computer, rather old looking from its design, rested upon the desk, several papers strewn on either side of it. Picking one up at random, Shinji glanced at the diagram on the paper. It was a simple floor plan of what seemed to be a room, but judging by the diagram, it wasn't any room in this house. Looking at another, Shinji read several lines that were clearly typed on the computer. Whoever the woman was, she appeared to be a contractor of sorts.

这是一间书房，一整面墙被一个巨大的书柜覆盖，里面塞满了许多书籍。真嗣对着书柜凝视了整整一分钟，才将目光转向房间中央的书桌。桌上放着一台设计显得相当老旧的电脑，两侧散落着几张纸。真嗣随手拿起一张，瞥了一眼纸上的图表。那是一个简单的房间平面图，但从图上来看，并非这栋房子里的任何一个房间。他又看了另一张纸，上面有几行显然是用电脑打出来的字。无论这位女士是谁，她似乎是个某种承包商。

He examined some of the other papers out of sheer curiosity, and then left this room, returning to the hallway. The last door at the end of the hallway was all Shinji had left to search, and he didn't have much hope. Still, it was best to check just in case. Reaching out for the door, he noticed that it was already opened, and instead, pushed his hands against it. The door swung open easily, revealing the contents inside, for which Shinji was not prepared for.

他出于纯粹的好奇心检查了一些其他文件，然后离开了这个房间，回到了走廊。走廊尽头的那扇门是真嗣最后需要搜索的地方，他对找到什么并不抱太大希望。不过，最好还是检查一下以防万一。伸手去推门时，他注意到门已经开了，于是便用手推了推。门轻松地打开了，露出了里面的内容，这让真嗣完全没有准备。

From looking at the rest of the house, there was nothing to suggest that a child once lived here, but Shinji had very clearly stepped into a child's bedroom. A single bed rested in a corner of the far wall, and toys were strewn along the floor. A small desk and chair were against the wall to the left of Shinji, and at a quick glance, several childish drawings could be seen spaced around the table, each in a different colored crayon. Taking everything in, Shinji was able to gather that a boy called this his room once, judging by the vast amount of action figures that cluttered the room. Shinji didn't know why, but this room gave him a certain sense of foreboding; he felt like he shouldn't be here.

从房子的其他部分来看，没有任何迹象表明这里曾经住过一个孩子，但真嗣显然走进了一个孩子的卧室。一张单人床靠在远处的墙角，玩具散落在地板上。一张小桌子和椅子靠在真嗣左边的墙上，匆匆一瞥，可以看到几张用不同颜色蜡笔画的儿童画散布在桌子上。环顾四周，真嗣能够看出这里曾经是一个男孩的房间，从房间里堆满的大量动作玩偶就可以判断。真嗣不知道为什么，但这个房间给他一种不祥的预感；他觉得他不应该在这里。

Taking several steps back, his gaze locked onto an object resting on the far shelf as he began to leave. It was a wooden clock, apparently very old, judging from the wood which seemed to have lost some of its sheen over the years. As though drawn to it somehow, Shinji found himself approaching it without a second thought, walking further into the room. Whatever sense he had gotten before, grew stronger now, as he approached the clock. When he began reaching out for it though, he suddenly stopped. Had he heard something, or was that just his imagination playing tricks on him.

他后退了几步，目光锁定在远处架子上的一个物体，正准备离开时。那是一个木制时钟，显然非常古老，从木材似乎随着岁月失去了一些光泽来看。不知为何被吸引，真嗣发现自己不假思索地向它走去，更深入房间。无论之前感受到的是什么，现在随着他接近时钟而变得更加强烈。然而，当他开始伸手去拿时，突然停了下来。是他听到了什么，还是只是他的想象在作祟。

Swiveling around, he looked down the hallway, straining his ears for any sound of movement. It certainly wasn't Asuka, but could an animal be living in here that he didn't know of? Before Shinji could think anything else, he was struck by a sudden wave of nausea, as something flashed before his eyes. A great amount of sadness filled him, along with...depression, was that it? Something else as well, but...no, Shinji couldn't grasp it. Something about this room however, and sadness; was it the woman's sadness, or the boys. What was there relation to each other? This room didn't hold any clues to that question.

他转身环顾走廊，竖起耳朵倾听任何动静。当然不是明日香，但会不会有什么他不知道的动物住在这里？在真嗣来得及思考其他事情之前，他突然感到一阵恶心，眼前闪过一些东西。巨大的悲伤充斥着他，还有...抑郁，是这个吗？还有别的什么，但...不，真嗣无法抓住。这个房间里有些什么，还有悲伤；是那个女人的悲伤，还是那个男孩的。他们之间有什么关系？这个房间并没有提供任何线索。

As the nausea passed, Shinji waited until his heart rate settled down. This was the first time he had encountered something like this, but it was similar to that of when he had felt Misato's final moments. Emotions dictated these, visions if you could call them that, but they were more like echoes of peoples lives, places where heavy emotional impacts on a persons lives had taken place. When he had witnessed Asuka's death, that had a much more real feel, but that was a true vision, compared to these echoes.

随着恶心感消退，真嗣等待着心跳平复。这是他首次经历这样的事情，但与感受到美里最后时刻的感觉相似。这些情感主导的体验，若称之为幻象，它们更像是人们生命中的回响，那些在人们生活中留下沉重情感印记的地方。当他目睹明日香的死亡时，那种感觉更为真实，但那是真正的幻象，与这些回响相比。

Shinji was frustrated that he hadn't improved his control over his AT-field, but could this be considered an improvement of sorts? During the nights when Shinji practiced, occasionally, when he was concentrating really hard, he sometimes felt a presence behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, he only ever saw Asuka, who usually gave him a small smile in return; but it was more than that. Shinji couldn't explain it, but it seemed to him, that the presence he was feeling was Asuka herself, her AT-field, so to speak. Though significantly smaller than his own, it appeared that Asuka had one as well. So did that mean every human had an AT-field? Was the AT-field the embodiment of a person themselves?

真嗣对自己未能提升 AT 力场的控制感到沮丧，但这能否算是一种另类的进步呢？在那些练习的夜晚，偶尔当他全神贯注时，他会感觉到身后似乎有某种存在。回头一看，他总是只见到明日香，她通常会回以一个浅浅的微笑；但这不仅仅是视觉上的。真嗣无法解释，但他觉得，他所感受到的正是明日香本人，或者说，她的 AT 力场。尽管明显比他自己的小得多，明日香似乎也拥有一个 AT 力场。那么这是否意味着每个人都有 AT 力场？AT 力场是否就是一个人自身的体现？

Now that his heart rate had settled down, Shinji fully backed out of the child's bedroom. He didn't know what significance that clock held for either the boy or woman, but he didn't want to know. Sadness and depression could swing several different ways, and Shinji wasn't keen on finding out which.

心跳平复后，真嗣完全退出了孩子的卧室。他不知道那座钟对男孩或女人有何意义，但他不想知道。悲伤和抑郁有多种走向，真嗣并不想探究其中哪一种。

Walking up the basement stairs, he passed through the kitchen and living room, before stepping out under the blue sky. Turning around, he looked back at the one story house. Was something like what witnessed usual for most humans? Would he find similar instances of emotional regrets if he continued searching the houses? Shinji didn't like that idea, and the thought of discovering something incredibly sinister crossed his mind briefly. With that thought in mind, he didn't feel like continuing his search, and decided to return home for now. Asuka was sure to be waiting afterall.

走上地下室的楼梯，他穿过厨房和客厅，最终踏入蓝天之下。转身回望，那栋单层房屋映入眼帘。这样的经历对大多数人来说是否寻常？若继续搜寻其他房屋，他会否发现类似的情感遗憾？真嗣并不喜欢这个想法，一瞬间，他脑海中闪过发现某种极其阴暗之物的念头。带着这样的思绪，他无心继续搜寻，决定暂时回家。毕竟，明日香肯定在等着他。

Opening the door to his own house, Shinji began hanging up his jacket in the closet beside the door, when he heard a voice coming from the opening to the dining room.

推开自家房门，真嗣开始将外套挂在门旁的衣橱里，这时，他听到餐厅入口处传来一个声音。

"How was your walk?" “散步怎么样？”

"Fine, I suppose," shrugged Shinji as he glanced over at Asuka. She had just finished breakfast, and had been in the process of cleaning up when Shinji walked in from the cold. Leaning against the wall, she crossed her arms, and asked, "Did something happen out there?"

“还行吧，”真嗣耸耸肩，目光瞥向明日香。她刚吃完早餐，正准备收拾，这时真嗣从寒冷的外面走了进来。她靠在墙上，双臂交叉，问道：“外面发生什么事了吗？”

"Why do you ask?" “你为什么这么问？”

"Your tone of voice seems odd I suppose."

"你的语气听起来似乎有些奇怪，我想。"

"So you noticed," replied Shinji with a small laugh.

"你注意到了啊，" 真嗣轻声笑道。"

Ever since Shinji had told Asuka about his AT-field, she had made him promise to tell her anything unusual that happened to him. Even if he didn't, she was smart enough to notice anything that might be different about his attitude in any given moment. This was natural when she had been living with him for so long.

自从真嗣向明日香透露了他的 AT 力场后，她就让他保证，无论发生什么不寻常的事都要告诉她。即使他不主动说，她也很聪明，能察觉到他在任何时刻态度上的任何不同。毕竟，他们已经共同生活了这么久，这是很自然的。

"You don't sound that happy about it," said Asuka as she walked towards him.

"你听起来并不怎么高兴啊，" 明日香边说边向他走去。

"I couldn't call it happy," sighed Shinji.

"我实在无法称之为高兴，" 真嗣叹息道。

Standing in front of him, Asuka crossed her arms and waited for him to reply. Without having much choice, Shinji recounted to Asuka what he had seen, or rather felt, in that child's room. By the time he was done, they had already migrated to the couch, and were now sitting beside each other.

站在他面前，明日香交叉双臂，等待他的回应。真嗣别无选择，只好向明日香讲述他在那个孩子的房间里所见，或者说所感受到的一切。等他讲完时，他们已经移步到沙发旁，并肩坐下。

"So you didn't see anything at all?" asked Asuka.

“所以你什么都没看到吗？”明日香问道。

"No, nothing. It was mostly sadness, and a sense of depression that I got. There was something else, but I couldn't grasp it. I'm honestly not sure if I wanted to."

“不，没什么。主要是悲伤，还有种抑郁的感觉。还有些别的，但我抓不住。老实说，我不确定自己是否想弄明白。”

"So you think something...bad, might have happened in that room?"

“所以你觉得那房间里可能发生了什么...不好的事？”

"No, not bad. Something very sad however. I think the woman was a widow, so that may have had something to do with it. But the child's room...there wasn't any photos of the boy, unlike the man. I don't know what that meant, but I don't think its pleasant."

“不，不是坏事。但非常悲伤。我觉得那位女士可能是寡妇，所以可能与此有关。但孩子的房间...没有男孩的照片，不像那位男士。我不知道这意味着什么，但我觉得不是什么愉快的事。”

"You think the woman lost both her husband, and child?"

“你认为这位女士失去了她的丈夫和子女吗？”

"Its just a thought," said Shinji.

“只是个想法。” 真嗣说道。

They both lapsed into silence after this, but Asuka changed the conversation away from this depressing topic.

他们在这之后都陷入了沉默，但明日香转移了话题，避开了这个令人沮丧的话题。

"You said that this reminded you of what you saw with Misato. How?"

“你说过这让你想起了和美里在一起时的情景。怎么回事？”

Shinji frowned at her, unsure how he should explain this.

真嗣皱眉看着她，不确定该如何解释。

"As far as I can tell, both instances were drawn from deep emotional impacts or regrets the person in question had. In Misato's case, I have no memory of her, even though I probably lived with her at one point. I got flashes of things, but nothing I could understand. I knew her, and yet I didn't at the same time. The feelings I got were mixed, but there definitely seemed to be regret mixed in, as well as relief of some kind. As for this latest circumstance, I knew absolutely nothing about this family before entering their house. I don't know what their relationship with each other was, or if they were even really a family. All I got was a strong surge of emotions, without any images to back anything up. The clock held some significance, but I don't know what it meant."

"就我所知，这两次情况都是源于当事人深切的情感冲击或遗憾。至于美里，我完全不记得她，尽管我可能曾经和她一起生活过。我脑海中闪过一些片段，但都是无法理解的东西。我认识她，同时又不认识她。我感受到的情绪很复杂，但确实夹杂着遗憾和某种解脱感。至于最近这次，在进入他们家之前，我对这个家庭一无所知。我不知道他们之间的关系如何，甚至不确定他们是否真的是一家人。我只感受到了强烈的情感涌动，却没有图像来佐证任何事情。那个钟表似乎有某种重要意义，但我不知道它意味着什么。"

"You're glossing over something else," mumbled Asuka.

"你在回避其他事情，"明日香咕哝道。"

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"What about myself...when you saw me die? What about that?"

"那我自己呢...当你看到我死去的时候？那又怎么说？"

"That...that was different," started Shinji. He was never keen on this subject, but he could explain this now from what he understood.

“那...那是不同的，”真嗣开口道。他向来不热衷于这个话题，但根据他的理解，现在可以解释清楚了。

"The vision I had of you Asuka, wasn't just an emotional outburst, or flashes of images: it was a sequence of events that appeared before me. The difference between yours, and the others...well, it sounds dumb for me to say it, but its probably because I've been around you for so long, that I've sorta become attuned to you."

我对你明日香的预感，并非只是一时的情感爆发，或是零星的画面闪现：那是一系列事件在我眼前展开的序列。你与其他人的不同之处……好吧，这话说出来可能有点傻，但大概是因为我与你相处得太久，以至于我渐渐与你产生了某种共鸣。

"...Huh?" stammered Asuka, blushing slightly. "Attuned, wh-what do you mean by that?"

"...啊？" 明日香结巴道，脸上微微泛红。"共鸣，你，你这是什么意思？"

"Err, well, I've noticed it before, when you watch me while I practice with my AT-field, but I think all humans have an AT-field."

"呃，这个，我之前就注意到了，当你看我练习 AT 力场的时候，但我觉得所有人类都有 AT 力场。"

"What? Are you kidding?" scoffed Asuka.

"什么？你在开玩笑吧？" 明日香嗤之以鼻。

"No, I'm serious. Its hard to describe, but if I concentrate, I can feel your presence, your AT-field."

"不，我是认真的。这很难描述，但如果我集中精神，我能感觉到你的存在，你的 AT 力场。"

"So every human being has an AT-field?" Asuka couldn't believe this; she felt like laughing.

"所以每个人都有 AT 力场？" 明日香无法相信这一点；她觉得这很可笑。

"I think the AT-field is the defining force behind humans; it makes us who we are. Both those visions I got of Misato and that woman, were because I was either in direct contact, or within an area they felt strongly about. Residuals of their AT-fields I guess you could call it."

"我认为 AT 力场是人类背后的决定性力量；它定义了我们是谁。我看到的关于美里和那个女人的幻象，都是因为我直接接触了她们，或者进入了她们强烈感受的区域。可以说是她们 AT 力场的残留吧。"

"What about mine then? You weren't near me, in contact with me, nor in an area where I have strong emotional ties. So why did you see something which hadn't even happened yet."

"那我的情况呢？你既不在我身边，也没有接触我，更不在我有强烈情感联系的区域。那你为什么会看到一个尚未发生的事情呢？"

"Like I said, because I'm attuned to you, used to you, I saw that vision. I think that, I've unconsciously become aware of your AT-field, which I thought of as your presence at the time."

"就像我说的，因为我与你心意相通，习惯了你，所以我看到了那个幻象。我想，我无意中察觉到了你的 AT 力场，当时我将其视为你的存在。"

Asuka didn't know why, but after Shinji made this statement, she had to turn away from him. 'Jeez, why did he have to say something stupid like that,' she thought.

明日香不知道为什么，但在真嗣说出这番话后，她不得不转过身去。'真是的，他干嘛要说这种蠢话，'她心想。

"So you've been unconsciously thinking about me, which is what you're getting at?" asked Asuka with her back still turned towards him.

"所以你一直在无意识地想着我，这就是你想说的？" 明日香背对着他问道。

"I suppose thats true, if you look at it from a certain perspective," frowned Shinji. Was Asuka going to get angry at him?

"如果从某个角度来看，确实如此，" 真嗣皱眉道。明日香会因此生他的气吗？

"...So all humans have an AT-field huh..." muttered Asuka. "Does that mean we can all learn to use them like you then?"

"...所以所有人类都有 AT 力场啊..." 明日香喃喃自语。"那是不是意味着我们都能像你一样学会使用它们？

"I don't think so," said Shinji as he shook his head. "Since the AT-field is the essence of who we are, people aren't conscious of the AT-field. You can't be aware of something if you can't feel it in someway. No, I'm unique in that aspect, but I still don't know why."

“我不这么认为，”真嗣摇着头说，“因为 AT 力场是我们本质的体现，人们并不会意识到它的存在。如果你无法以某种方式感受到它，你就无法意识到它。不，在这方面我是独一无二的，但我仍然不明白为什么。”

As he said this, Asuka briefly thought about Shinji's eyes flashing scarlet. She still hadn't told him, but she had convinced herself that it was unimportant.

正当他说着这些时，明日香短暂地想起了真嗣眼中闪过的猩红。她仍未告诉他，但她已说服自己这无关紧要。

"Is that it then?" asked Asuka.

"就这样吗？" 明日香问道。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Good, because I want to go outside now."

"太好了，因为我现在想出去。"

"What, why?" "什么，为什么？"

"Because its a clear day obviously," answered Asuka. "Who knows how long it'll be before we get another one like this."

"因为今天天气晴朗，显然如此，" 明日香回答道。"谁知道我们下次还能不能遇到这样的好天气。"

"I just came back inside though."

"可我刚从里面回来。"

"Thats your fault for leaving so early," smirked Asuka as she left the couch, and went upstairs to change into something warmer.

"那是你自己的错，谁让你那么早就离开了，" 明日香笑着从沙发上起身，上楼去换上更暖和的衣服。"

With the day as clear as it was, Shinji and Asuka found themselves spending most of the day outside. They were still only fifteen years old, so a pile of snow was still appealing to them. Multiple times, Asuka couldn't help but stuff snow down the back of Shinji's shirt. Afterwards, he retaliated by pelting her in the face with a snow ball, turning her cheeks red from the cold. During the last of these, they started an all war against each other, throwing snow balls at each other. Asuka was merciless in her assault, and had much greater aim than Shinji, striking him each an every time she threw a snow ball. Shinji was less fortunate in his assault, being hit more often then striking a hit on Asuka.

在如此晴朗的日子里，真嗣和明日香大部分时间都在户外度过。他们毕竟只有十五岁，一堆雪对他们来说依然充满吸引力。有好几次，明日香忍不住将雪塞进真嗣的衬衫后背。随后，他以一个雪球回击，砸在她的脸上，让她的脸颊因寒冷而泛红。最后一次，他们开始了一场全面的雪仗，互相投掷雪球。明日香在攻击中毫不留情，她的瞄准比真嗣好得多，每次投掷都能击中他。真嗣就没那么幸运了，他被打中的次数远多于击中明日香。

As the day waned onward, and their hands started to freeze even though they had gloves, they decided to call it quits, and head inside. While Asuka went upstairs to change out of her wet clothes, Shinji began making tea downstairs. He had only taken his jacket and gloves off, the rest of his body remaining quite warm. When Asuka returned downstairs, he brought two cups of tea into the living room, and they sat down beside each other. Clasping the cup between her hands, Asuka let out a sigh as her hands began to warm up.

随着天色渐晚，尽管戴着手套，他们的手也开始冻僵，于是决定收工，进屋取暖。Asuka 上楼换下湿衣服，而 Shinji 则在楼下开始泡茶。他只脱掉了外套和手套，身体其余部分依然相当暖和。Asuka 回到楼下时，Shinji 已经端着两杯茶走进客厅，两人并肩坐下。Asuka 双手捧着茶杯，随着手逐渐暖和起来，她轻轻叹了口气。

"You really can't handle the cold very well, which is shocking, considering you're from Germany," remarked Shinji.

"你真的不太能忍受寒冷，这很让人惊讶，考虑到你是从德国来的，" 真嗣评论道。

"I've noticed you can however," smirked Asuka. Removing her hand from her cup, she brushed it against Shinji's cheek, making him jump from the sudden change in temperature.

"我倒是注意到你能忍受，" 明日香微微一笑。她从杯子上移开手，轻轻拂过真嗣的脸颊，让他因为突然的温度变化而跳了起来。

"Don't do that," groaned Shinji.

"别这样，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka didn't reply, but sipped her tea instead. It was still daylight out, but that would be fading within the hour. Deciding that he may as well begin preparing dinner now, Shinji stood up to do so.

明日香没有回答，只是啜饮着她的茶。外面还是白天，但再过一个小时就会天黑了。决定现在就开始准备晚餐，真嗣站起身来去做饭。

"Hang on, I'll help," said Asuka.

“等等，我来帮忙，”明日香说。

"You sure you won't freeze if you move away from the fireplace?" asked Shinji. Asuka's scowl was all the answer he needed.

“你确定离开壁炉不会冻着吗？”真嗣问道。明日香皱眉的表情已经给了他足够的答案。

He was always glad when Asuka helped, as it cut down on the more tedious time spent waiting for the water to boil. At least he had someone to talk to while he waited, and she usually helped him prepare the meal, but sometimes she did just stand back and watch.

每当明日香帮忙时，他总是感到高兴，因为这减少了等待水烧开的更乏味的时间。至少在等待的时候有人可以聊天，而且她通常会帮他准备饭菜，但有时她只是站在一旁观看。

After dinner was finished, they returned to the living room, and ate there. They had recently been using the dining room more often, but both agreed that being in front of the fireplace would be more enjoyable right now.

晚餐结束后，他们回到客厅，在那里用餐。他们最近更常使用餐厅，但两人都认为此刻在壁炉前会更愉快。

"Hey Shinji, can I ask you something?"

“嘿，真嗣，我能问你件事吗？”

"Hmm?" replied Shinji to Asuka's question.

“嗯？” 真嗣对明日香的问题回应道。

"Well, its just that, in all the practice with your AT-field, you haven't tried to destroy anything with it."

“嗯，只是，在所有与你的 AT 力场的练习中，你还没有尝试用它来摧毁任何东西。”

"No, I haven't," Shinji admittedly said. "I don't want to use my AT-field for destruction if I can help it. I'm sure it'll happen eventually, but I want to be able to control it properly beforehand. Why did you ask?"

“是的，我没有，”真嗣坦承道，“我不想在能避免的情况下用 AT 力场进行破坏。我知道这迟早会发生，但我希望在此之前能正确控制它。你为什么这么问？”

"Just curious I guess," shrugged Asuka as she returned to her soup. Shinji raised an eyebrow, but didn't reply.

“只是有点好奇吧，”明日香耸耸肩，继续喝她的汤。真嗣挑了挑眉，但没有回应。

After dinner, they washed everything away, and then Shinji prepared to go outside for the third time today, to practice with his AT-field.

晚餐后，他们将一切收拾干净，随后真嗣准备第三次出门，去练习使用他的 AT 力场。

"You coming?" asked Shinji towards Asuka.

"你来吗？" 真嗣朝明日香问道。

Pausing briefly, Asuka instead asked, "Do you want me to come?"

明日香停顿了一下，转而问道："你想让我来吗？"

Shinji wasn't going to tell her no, but if she didn't come, he'd have another opportunity to find something for her. Either way, it didn't bother him that much whether she decided to or not.

真嗣不会对她说“不”，但如果她不来，他还有机会为她找点什么。无论她是否决定来，他对此并不太在意。

"I'll leave that up to you."

"这由你决定。"

"How cryptic," muttered Asuka, "but, whatever, I guess I will. I didn't come last night afterall."

"真神秘，"明日香嘀咕道，"不过，随便了，我想我会去的。毕竟昨晚我根本没来。"

With that out of the way, Asuka went upstairs to put on another sweatshirt, and met Shinji by the front door. Exiting into the night, the moon was beaming down on them, and the stars were twinkling in the sky above them. Neither of them had seen the stars in a while, and they both stood silently beside each other, gazing upwards for several seconds.

解决了这个问题后，明日香上楼换了件运动衫，然后在门口与真嗣会合。步入夜幕，月光洒在他们身上，繁星在天空中闪烁。他们已经很久没有看到星星了，两人默默地并肩站立，仰望天空，凝视了好几秒钟。

"Lets get this over with," said Shinji, tearing his eyes away from the sky.

“让我们快点结束吧，”真嗣说着，将目光从天空移开。

"You don't sound very excited," said Asuka.

“你听起来不太兴奋啊，”明日香说。

"Try putting yourself in my shoes," sighed Shinji. "I'm trying to control something I hardly even understand, not to mention that I have you to worry about as well."

“试着站在我的角度想想，”真嗣叹了口气。“我正试图控制一个我几乎完全不了解的东西，更别提还得担心你了。”

"Whats that supposed to be mean?" asked Asuka, her tone growing cold. "Do you not appreciate me being here?"

“那是什么意思？”明日香问道，语气变得冷淡。“你不喜欢我在这里吗？”

"No, I didn't mean it like that. Only that if something were to happen to you by accident, because I couldn't control my AT-field, I don't know what I would do."

"不，我不是那个意思。只是说，如果因为我的 AT 力场失控，你出了什么意外，我不知道我会怎么办。"

"Would you stop saying stuff like that. Like I've said before, I trust you," grumbled Asuka, more out of embarrassment over Shinji saying something like that.

"你能别再说这种话了吗。就像我之前说的，我相信你，" 明日香咕哝着，更多的是因为绫波说出这样的话而感到尴尬。"

"Still..." mumbled Shinji, before he trailed off. They had reached the end of the block.

"不过..." 绫波低声说道，然后话音渐渐消失。他们已经走到了街区的尽头。"

Almost as a ritual, both of them got in their preassigned positions, with Shinji standing in the middle of the road, and Asuka remaining on the sidewalk. Again, Shinji took several moments to compose himself, before he projected his AT-field. He didn't try the wall, like he had done previously. His control over that was the shakiest, and he was only able to maintain it for twenty seconds before it exhausted him. Instead, he had been recently focusing on the simple blade like AT-field that was used for cutting. In theory, if he practiced enough with this one, then his ability to control the wall would improve. He still hadn't been able to condense the blade down to a smaller size, and the blade itself could still very easily carve a wide hole straight down the middle of the street.

几乎像是一种仪式，两人各自站到了预定的位置，真嗣站在路中央，而明日香则留在人行道上。真嗣再次花了些时间调整自己，然后展开了他的 AT 力场。他没有尝试之前用过的墙壁型力场，那种控制最为不稳定，他只能维持二十秒就会筋疲力尽。相反，他最近专注于练习简单的刀刃型 AT 力场，理论上，如果他在这方面练习足够，那么他对墙壁型力场的控制能力也会提高。他仍然无法将刀刃压缩得更小，而且那刀刃本身很容易就能在街道中央劈开一道宽阔的裂缝。

After practicing for almost twenty minutes, Shinji dissipated his AT-field, letting his arm fall back at his side. Almost immediately, he felt a cold hand grab onto his. After Asuka had been watching him for these past few days, her hands were usually freezing, so she used Shinji's to warm hers up.

练习了近二十分钟后，真嗣散去了他的 AT 力场，手臂无力地垂在身侧。几乎立刻，他感到一只冰冷的手抓住了他。明日香这几天一直在观察他，她的手通常都是冰凉的，所以她用真嗣的手来取暖。

"Do you have to do this every time?"

“你每次都得这么做吗？”

"Quiet," retorted Asuka, her cheeks pink from the cold.

“安静，”明日香回道，她的脸颊因寒冷而泛红。

Shinji frowned, but let her do as she pleased, until she was satisfied, and stuck her hands back into her sweatshirt pockets.

真嗣皱了皱眉，但还是任由她随心所欲，直到她满意为止，然后将手重新插回运动衫口袋。

"You done?" asked Shinji, but Asuka didn't reply, since she had already started walking back.

“你好了吗？”真嗣问道，但明日香没有回答，因为她已经开始往回走了。

After this, they spend the remaining hours of the day in the living room, before both decided to go to sleep. As Shinji entered his room, and closed the door, he couldn't help but feeling a certain pang in his heart, knowing that there was almost a week until Christmas arrived.

之后，他们在客厅里度过了剩下的时光，最终决定去睡觉。当真嗣走进自己的房间并关上门时，他不禁感到心中一阵刺痛，因为知道距离圣诞节还有将近一周的时间。

Again, Shinji found himself in a similar situation. It was early morning the next day, and he was already continuing his search for something that he thought may be worthy of a present for Asuka. So far, no luck however. He had continued his search from where he left off yesterday, still remembering the house from yesterday, but trying not to pay it too much attention. No matter where he looked though, he always found the same things; jewelry and clothes were in abundant quantity, but neither of these felt like much of a Christmas present. What was unique, something that was one of a kind, that Shinji could give to Asuka? Did something like that even exist in the first place?

又一次，真嗣发现自己陷入了类似的境地。第二天清晨，他已经开始继续寻找他认为可能适合送给明日香的礼物。然而，到目前为止，他还没有找到。他从昨天中断的地方继续搜索，依然记得昨天的那栋房子，但尽量不去过多关注。无论他走到哪里，总是发现同样的东西；珠宝和衣服数量众多，但这些似乎都不太像圣诞礼物。有什么是独一无二的，是真嗣能送给明日香的呢？这样的东西真的存在吗？

Shinji entered the fourth house today, kicking the door open with hardly a second thought. He applied to much pressure however, and the doorknob was forced through the wooden panel of the door, the wood splintering where the knob had once been. Shinji rebuked himself for this, knowing that he could control his strength better than this. He was beginning to get frustrated however. Was he just being picky in his decision? He really did want to get something for Asuka that was special, not because she asked him, but because he wanted to.

今天，真嗣走进了第四栋房子，几乎没多想就一脚踢开了门。然而，他用力过猛，门把手穿透了木门板，原本装有把手的地方木屑四溅。真嗣为此责备自己，知道他本可以更好地控制自己的力量。然而，他开始感到沮丧。难道他只是在选择上过于挑剔吗？他真的很想为明日香挑选一些特别的东西，不是因为她要求，而是因为他自己想这么做。

Stepping through the threshold of the door, Shinji glanced around briefly at his surroundings. It was similar to the previous houses he had entered, and Shinji found himself immediately heading for the staircase that would take him to the second floor. The master bedroom wasn't unusual, having a large, kingsized bed in the middle of the room, a dresser against the wall beside this, with a mirror hanging above the dresser. Shinji went through all the drawers in this room, finding nothing of interest.

跨过门槛，真嗣简短地环顾了一下四周。这里与他之前进入的房子相似，真嗣立刻朝通往二楼的楼梯走去。主卧室并不特别，房间中央摆着一张大号双人床，床边靠墙放着一个梳妆台，上方挂着一面镜子。真嗣翻遍了这个房间的所有抽屉，没有发现任何感兴趣的东西。

Sighing heavily, Shinji began walking downstairs, but paused when he heard a loud creak, coming from the living room. Pausing in his steps, he was incredibly glad that he was standing on carpet, and listened. An animal came to mind first, but he didn't think an animal's footfalls would be this heavy. In that case, there seemed to be only one explanation, even if it was rather strange. Thinking about it however, it wasn't to far of a stretch to suggest that their paths may cross at some point.

重重地叹了口气，真嗣开始下楼，却在听到客厅传来一声巨响时停下了脚步。他庆幸自己正站在地毯上，便驻足聆听。首先浮现在脑海的是某种动物，但他不认为动物的脚步声会如此沉重。如此一来，似乎只有一个解释，尽管颇为离奇。然而转念一想，他们的道路在某处交汇也并非不可能。

"Is that you Asuka?" asked Shinji from halfway up the staircase.

“是你吗，明日香？”真嗣从楼梯中段问道。

A girlish shriek, accompanied by an almighty crash, gave all the reasons for Shinji to know it was Asuka. Running the rest of the way downstairs, he rounded the corner, and saw Asuka kneeling by the front door. The shattered remains of a glass vase was at her feet, and she seemed to be partially stunned from this sudden encounter with Shinji.

一声少女的尖叫，伴随着一声巨响，让真嗣立刻明白那是明日香。他急忙跑下剩余的楼梯，转过拐角，看到明日香正跪在前门旁。一个玻璃花瓶的碎片散落在她脚边，她似乎被这突如其来的相遇弄得有些发懵。

"I didn't know you could scream like that," remarked Shinji. At his voice, Asuka's face darted up to look at him, and her face grew red with anger.

"我从不知道你能尖叫成那样，" 真嗣评论道。听到他的声音，明日香的脸猛地抬起看向他，她的脸因愤怒而涨红。

"Damn it, you startled me you idiot."

"该死，你吓到我了，你这个白痴。"

"You're the one that was skulking around downstairs."

"是你自己在楼下鬼鬼祟祟的。"

"Shut it you-Ow!" "闭嘴，你——哎哟！"

Asuka yelled rather loudly, as she stepped on a sharp fragment of glass. It buried its way into the sole of her shoes, stabbing into the skin of her foot. Noticing this, Shinji immediately rushed at her.

明日香大声喊道，她踩到了一块锋利的玻璃碎片。那碎片刺穿了她的鞋底，扎进了她的脚掌。注意到这一点，真嗣立刻冲向她。

"Ow! Damn it, this is your fault Shinji!"

"哎哟！该死，这都是你的错，真嗣！"

"How is this my fault? Come on, lets move outside and get away from this glass."

"这怎么成了我的错了？来吧，我们到外面去，远离这些玻璃。"

Still wincing in pain, Asuka hobbled outside while leaning against Shinji, and sat on the edge of one of the front steps. Crouching beside her, Shinji carefully removed her shoes, revealing the sock underneath. The cotton had turned red around her heel, and was still oozing blood.

仍然因疼痛而皱眉，明日香一瘸一拐地靠着真嗣走到外面，坐在前台阶的边缘。真嗣蹲在她旁边，小心翼翼地脱下她的鞋子，露出下面的袜子。棉袜在她脚后跟周围已经变成了红色，血还在渗出。

"I'm gonna remove the glass," said Shinji.

""我要把玻璃取出来，""真嗣说。

"Just get it over with already," shouted Asuka.

“快点结束吧，”明日香喊道。

Thankfully, the glass wasn't too large, and hadn't buried it's way very far into Asuka's foot. If she hadn't had been wearing shoes, it would have been a different story, but Shinji didn't have any difficulties removing it. Throwing the glass back through the open front door, it landed beside the rest of the broken glass. Turning back to Asuka's injured foot, he had to decide what to do. Asuka could probably limp home while leaning against him, but the quickest way would be to certainly...

幸运的是，玻璃碎片并不大，也没有深深扎进明日香的脚里。如果她当时没穿鞋，情况就完全不同了，但真嗣取出玻璃碎片并不费力。他把玻璃扔回敞开的前门，落在其他碎玻璃旁边。转身面对明日香受伤的脚，他必须决定下一步该怎么做。明日香或许可以靠在他身上一瘸一拐地回家，但最快的方法无疑是……

Making his decision, Shinji knelt down in front of Asuka, indicating that he wanted her to wrap her arms around his neck. If not for her bleeding foot, Asuka would have probably refused, but even she could understand the logic behind this. Without saying any snide comments, she wrapped her arms around him, clinging onto him, as he hoisted her in the air. Either Asuka was incredibly light, or Shinji's strength was greater than he realized, because it felt no different than carrying a small child.

做出决定后，真嗣跪在明日香面前，示意她用双臂环住他的脖子。如果不是因为她的脚在流血，明日香可能会拒绝，但即便她也能明白这个决定的合理性。她没有说出任何挖苦的话，而是紧紧抱住他，随着他把她举起。无论是明日香异常轻盈，还是真嗣的力量超乎自己的想象，因为这感觉就像抱着一个小孩一样轻松。

"You okay?" asked Shinji.

"你还好吗？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka nodded briefly, rubbing her head against Shinji's back. Smiling slightly, Shinji began walking. They were only four blocks away from their own house, so the journey wouldn't take long. Still, an awkward silence developed between them as Shinji carried Asuka. She was incredibly still as Shinji carried her, not moving a muscle, but tightly clinging onto him. Shinji didn't want this silence to persist however, and decided to ask her something.

明日香简短地点了点头，将头靠在真嗣的背上摩挲。真嗣微微一笑，开始向前走。他们离自己的家只有四个街区，所以这段路不会太久。然而，真嗣背着明日香，两人之间却形成了一种尴尬的沉默。明日香一动不动地紧贴着真嗣，肌肉紧绷，紧紧抓住他。真嗣不想让这种沉默持续下去，于是决定问她一个问题。

"Hey Asuka...what were doing out here anyway?"

“嘿，明日香……你到底在外面做什么？”

She didn't immediately reply, and Shinji at first thought that she didn't want to, until she mumbled, "Probably the same thing you were doing..."

她没有立即回答，真嗣起初以为她不想说，直到她咕哝道：“可能和你做的是同一件事……”

'Well, I expected this sort of answer I suppose,' thought Shinji.

“嗯，我想我预料到了这种回答，”真嗣心想。

"That particular house then, why did you choose that one?"

“那么那栋房子，你为什么选择那一家？”

"...I saw that the door was already open, and when I went to investigate, I saw that the handle had been broken."

“……我看到门已经开着，当我去查看时，发现门把手已经坏了。”

"Ah, yeah, that was me."

“啊，对，是我。”

"I know now," muttered Asuka.

"我现在明白了。" 明日香喃喃自语。

"Sorry, that was an accident," replied Shinji.

“抱歉，那是个意外。” 真嗣回答道。

"Hmm," sighed Asuka. “嗯，”明日香叹了口气。

They didn't talk again until they returned home. Shinji laid Asuka down on the couch, and went into the bathroom to find some disinfectant. Returning, he removed the bloody sock that was still on Asuka's foot, and began to clean the blood away. She didn't complain, but her forehead was sweating slightly. The wound was small in diameter, and after Shinji washed the blood away, he placed a cotton ball against the wound, and then wrapped it in surgical tape. He could only hope that it wouldn't become infected. Even so, Asuka's foot would probably hurt for the next few days, and walking would probably be painful.

他们回到家后才再次交谈。真嗣让明日香躺在沙发上，然后去浴室找消毒剂。回来后，他脱下明日香脚上沾血的袜子，开始清理血迹。她没有抱怨，但额头上微微冒汗。伤口直径不大，真嗣清洗完血迹后，用棉球按压伤口，再用手术胶带包扎。他只能祈祷伤口不会感染。即便如此，明日香的脚接下来几天可能会痛，走路大概也会很疼。

"How do you feel?" asked Shinji.

“感觉怎么样？”真嗣问道。

"What do you think," said Asuka as she sat up. Lightly placing her injured foot on the ground, she winced slightly, as she put pressure on it. It hurt a lot, but Asuka thought she could deal with it if she absolutely had to.

"你觉得呢," 明日香坐起身来说道。她轻轻地将受伤的脚放在地上，微微皱眉，当她施加压力时，感到一阵疼痛。虽然很痛，但明日香认为如果非得忍受，她还是可以应付的。

"Do you want any painkillers?"

"你要不要吃点止痛药？"

"No, I can handle it," sighed Asuka.

"不用，我能挺住," 明日香叹了口气。

Laying back down, she placed her hand over her forehead and muttered, "What a stupid thing to do a week away from Christmas."

她重新躺下，手放在额头上喃喃自语：“圣诞节前一周做这种蠢事。”

"Sorry," whispered Shinji.

“对不起，”真嗣低声说。

"It isn't your fault." “这不是你的错。”

"If I hadn't called out to you though."

"如果我当时没有叫住你。"

"Don't feel sorry for yourself Shinji. What happened, happened. It doesn't matter how or why, but it did. But, a week away...what am I gonna do now?"

“别自怨自艾了，真嗣。发生的事已经发生了。不管原因如何，事实就是如此。但是，离开一周……我现在该怎么办呢？”

"What are you talking about Asuka?" asked Shinji.

“你在说什么呢，明日香？”真嗣问道。

Turning her gaze towards him, Asuka mumbled, "Don't act like you don't understand Shinji, afterall, we both had the same idea today. With my foot like this and all though. .."

明日香将目光转向他，喃喃道：“别装作不明白，真嗣，毕竟，我们今天都有同样的想法。只是我的脚变成这样了……”

Shinji understood then, what Asuka was talking about. If all she could do was hobble around the house for the next few days, how was she going to find something for him? He wasn't the only one who was having difficulties, but now Asuka was frustrated that simply walking took enough effort. If that was the case, then-

那时，真嗣明白了明日香所言之意。如果接下来几天她只能一瘸一拐地在屋里走动，她要如何为他找到些什么呢？他并非唯一面临困境的人，但现在明日香因简单的行走都需耗费如此大的力气而感到沮丧。若情况如此，那么——

"You don't have to get me anything," sighed Shinji.

“你不必给我买任何东西。”真嗣叹息道。

"What? Yes I do. Didn't we agree on this?" said Asuka as her eyes locked with his.

"什么？是的，我同意了。我们不是已经说好了吗？" 明日香的眼神与他对视着说道。

"Well, yeah but, it may be better to keep your weight off your foot."

"嗯，是的，但或许你最好还是别让脚承受重量。"

"So I'm just supposed to stay here and sit around reading, or do whatever, while you go out?" Asuka was growing angry at him.

"所以我就要一直待在这里，坐着看书，或者干别的，而你却出去？" 明日香对他越来越生气。

Shinji didn't mean it like that, but he didn't think that getting him a present warranted walking around the neighborhood, and risk opening the wound again. The wound wasn't serious, but Shinji wasn't taking any chances. The fact that he hadn't seen anything, any vision, was a good sign, but again, he wasn't even entirely sure how that worked.

真嗣并不是那个意思，但他不认为为了给他买礼物而四处逛逛值得，还可能再次撕裂伤口。伤口并不严重，但真嗣不愿冒险。他没看到任何幻象，这是个好迹象，但他也不完全确定这是怎么回事。

"If I say I can handle it, then I can," said Asuka. She didn't want to be a liability again; she had already gone through that once before, and she wasn't going to let that happen again.

“如果我说我能应付，那我就能，”明日香说。她不想再次成为负担；她已经经历过一次，绝不允许这种事再次发生。

"Whether you can handle it or not, isn't up for debate; its whatever's best for you which is what I'm concerned about."

“无论你能否应付，这不是争论的焦点；我关心的是怎样对你最好。”

"Whatever's best for..." stuttered Asuka. Darting her eyes away from Shinji, she couldn't help but feel her cheeks heat up. Always saying something like that; why did he have to say things like that? He sometimes said awfully heartfelt things, and Asuka was never sure whether that was his nature, or something else.

"无论什么对你最好..." 明日香结巴着说。她将目光从真嗣身上移开，忍不住感到脸颊发烫。总是说那样的话；他为什么非得说那样的话呢？他有时会说非常发自内心的话，而明日香从来不确定那是他的本性，还是别的什么。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji, puzzled over this silence from her.

"明日香？" 真嗣问道，对她这突如其来的沉默感到困惑。

"Why did you say something like that?" mumbled Asuka, her face turned away from his.

“你为什么要那样说？”明日香咕哝着，脸转向一旁，避开他的目光。

"Something like that? Oh. Whatever's best for you? Well, it's how I honestly feel, so I just said what I felt."

“那样的话？哦。无论对你最好的是什么？好吧，这是我真实的感受，所以我只是说出了我的感觉。”

Asuka turned back to him, staring at Shinji who was sitting in front of the couch at eye level with her. Why did he care about her so much? Did he feel obligated for some reason to look after her? Asuka didn't need somebody watching her back, or maybe it was better to say, she had never needed somebody to watch her back. What did that entail though? To lend the person a helping hand when they were down; to nurse them back to health when they were sick; to simply be beside them? Did Asuka want Shinji beside her?

明日香转回来看着他，盯着坐在沙发前与她视线平齐的真嗣。他为什么这么关心她？他是否因为某种原因觉得有义务照顾她？明日香不需要有人在她背后看着，或者更确切地说，她从未需要过有人在她背后看着。但这意味着什么呢？在别人跌倒时伸出援手；在他们生病时照顾他们恢复健康；只是简单地陪在他们身边？明日香希望真嗣在她身边吗？

"Why do you feel that?" whispered Asuka, almost inaudibly.

"你为什么会有这种感觉？" 明日香低声细语，几乎听不见。

"Why? I don't know," shrugged Shinji. "I just do. Is it that unusual?"

"为什么？我不知道，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"我就是有。这很奇怪吗？

"No, but-" "不，但是-"

'Do I deserve that?' wondered Asuka. 'Do I deserve this...this...'

"'我应得这些吗？' 明日香暗自思忖，'我应得这...这...'”

Asuka had difficulties putting those thoughts into words, even in her own mind. What had she done to make Shinji care about her? Was it because she helped him, when his leg was broken? Was it because she hadn't shunned him, even after every strange circumstance that had arisen around him? Was it because he had just gotten used to her, haughtiness and all? What if it was something else?

明日香难以将这些思绪用言语表达，即便是在她自己的脑海中。她做了什么让真嗣关心她？是因为她在他腿断时帮助了他吗？是因为她没有因围绕他的种种怪异情况而疏远他吗？还是因为他已经习惯了她的傲慢，包括一切？会不会是其他原因呢？

"Asuka, are you feeling alright?" asked Shinji.

“明日香，你感觉还好吗？” 真嗣问道。

Being pulled away from her thoughts, Asuka stared back at Shinji, his head tilted slightly to the side and looking at her.

被从思绪中拉回，明日香盯着真嗣，他的头微微侧向一边，正看着她。

"F-Fine," mumbled Asuka, as she looked away from him; her face was beginning to burn again. Jesus, what was wrong with her?

"好-好吧，" 明日香咕哝着，目光从他身上移开；她的脸又开始发烫了。天哪，她这是怎么了？

"You sure? Your face seemed a little red."

"你确定吗？你的脸看起来有点红。"

"I'm fine," stated Asuka, mustering as much authority in her voice as she could in that moment.

"我没事，" 明日香说道，竭尽全力让自己的声音听起来尽可能有威严。

"Okay," nodded Shinji. If Asuka could be so sure of herself, than she must be fine.

"好的，" 真嗣点头道。既然明日香如此自信，那她一定没事。

"What are you gonna do now?" asked Asuka, as Shinji stood up. "Do you plan on going back out there?"

"你现在打算做什么？" 明日香问道，看着真嗣站起身来。"你打算再出去吗？"

"Well, I'd be lying if I said the thought didn't cross my mind, but..."

“好吧，如果我说这念头没闪过脑海，那我就是在撒谎，但是……”

Shinji frowned, unsure whether he should stay or go. He wanted to keep Asuka company, now that she was stuck in the house, but on the other hand, he was more desperate than ever to find a present for her. Still, he hadn't had any luck so far.

真嗣皱了皱眉，不确定是该留下还是离开。他想要陪伴明日香，毕竟她现在被困在家里，但另一方面，他比以往任何时候都更迫切地想为她找到一份礼物。然而，到目前为止，他还没有任何好运。

"What are you thinking?" asked Asuka, wondering why he had suddenly stopped in mid sentence.

“你在想什么？”明日香问道，好奇他为什么突然停下了话头。

"Well, I haven't had much luck in finding you something, so I was actually hoping that you could give me some idea what you'd like."

“嗯，我还没找到什么适合你的东西，所以我其实希望你能给我一些建议，告诉我你想要什么。”

"Thats it?" wondered Asuka. "Even after all this time, you haven't thought of anything?"

"就这样？" 明日香疑惑道，"即便过了这么久，你也没想出什么来吗？"

"Weren't you in a similar situation?"

"你不是也经历过类似的情况吗？"

"...I guess," mumbled Asuka, "but even if you ask me, I don't really know. If I ever wanted something, I'd have to go out shopping and actually buy it. Now, anything I want I can just get. Besides, I haven't even thought about wanting something just because it appealed to me in a long time. Something that baseless, just felt pointless I think."

"...大概吧，" 明日香咕哝着，"但就算你问我，我也不太清楚。如果我想要什么，我得去购物并实际买下来。现在，我想要的东西随时都能得到。而且，我已经很久没有因为某样东西吸引我就想要它了。那种毫无根据的欲望，我觉得毫无意义。"

"Are you suggesting that I don't get anything for you either?" asked Shinji.

“你是说我也不能为你做任何事吗？” 真嗣问道。

"No, but whether you do or don't doesn't really make a difference to me. It won't make me like, or dislike you any more or less than I already do."

“不，但无论你做与否，对我来说都没什么差别。这不会让我对你的喜欢或讨厌有任何增减。”

Asuka's attitude was clearly diminished, now that her foot had been cut open. She was less enthused about the gift exchange, and Christmas in general it seemed now.

明日香的态度明显减弱了，自从她的脚被切开之后。她对礼物交换的热情大减，似乎连圣诞节本身也变得索然无味了。

"It was a stupid idea in the first place," whispered Asuka.

"一开始就是个愚蠢的主意，" 明日香低声说道。

"What was that?" asked Shinji, not hearing her.

"那是什么？" 真嗣问道，没听清她的话。

"Nothing, forget it," sighed Asuka as she covered her face with her hands.

"没什么，忘了吧，" 明日香叹了口气，双手捂住了脸。

Shinji spent another hour with her, until he left the house again, in search of a present. He returned to the block where he had been searching, and continued from there. He found many things as he searched the entirety of the neighborhood, but nothing he felt was particularly significant. Maybe his searching was in fact futile, and that it was hopeless.

真嗣又和她待了一个小时，直到他再次离开家，去寻找礼物。他回到了之前搜索过的街区，并从那里继续寻找。他在整个社区搜寻了许多东西，但没有找到特别有意义的。也许他的寻找实际上是徒劳的，一切都无望了。

The look on Asuka's face when she had told him he didn't have to get her anything, was not something he wanted to see. He knew she had only said that, because she wouldn't be able to get him anything. Compared to when she had first suggested the gift exchange, it was a departure from her feelings at the time when she had said he should only get her something. The exchange had meant more to her, than Asuka had initially led Shinji to believe.

明日香告诉他不必为她买任何东西时的表情，是他不想看到的。他知道她这么说，只是因为她无法为他买任何东西。与她最初提议交换礼物时相比，这偏离了她当时的感受，那时她说他应该只给她买些东西。交换礼物对她来说意义更重大，这是明日香最初没有让真嗣意识到的。

After another two hours of searching however, Shinji decided to call it quits. He would try later that night, after he was done practicing with his AT-field. For now, he just wanted to return home where Asuka was waiting.

然而，又搜寻了两个小时后，真嗣决定放弃。他打算晚上练习完 AT 力场后再试。现在，他只想回家，明日香在那里等着他。

Opening the door, he hung his jacket up, and turned towards the couch, but was surprised to see that Asuka was missing.

打开门，他挂起外套，转身面向沙发，却惊讶地发现明日香不见了。

"Asuka?" called Shinji. “明日香？”真嗣喊道。

She didn't answer him, and nor did he hear any noise from the rest of the house. He was beginning to feel worried. Surely she hadn't tried to follow after him; he would have certainly seen her if she had.

她没有回答他，整栋房子也静悄悄的，没有一丝声响。他开始感到担忧。她肯定没有试图跟着他；如果她这么做了，他一定会看到的。

Checking both the kitchen, living room, and then the study, he determined that she wasn't on the ground floor. Climbing the stairs, he checked both his room, and the empty children's room, before reaching the last door, which was hers. Her door was ajar, and Shinji pushed it open, letting out a low sigh as he saw a familiar face lying curled up on the bed. She wasn't under the covers, but had her legs tucked upwards toward her chest. Smiling slightly at this, Shinji walked over to the bed, and sat on the edge of it, directly next to Asuka. Her face was peaceful as she slept, and Shinji stared at it for several seconds, before turning to other matters. He didn't really want to wake her, but the cotton ball against her foot needed changing.

他先检查了厨房、客厅，然后是书房，确定她不在一楼。爬上楼梯，他先查看了自己的房间，接着是空无一人的儿童房，最后来到她的房门前。她的门半开着，真嗣轻轻推开门，看到一张熟悉的面孔蜷缩在床上，不禁松了口气。她没有盖被子，而是把双腿蜷缩到胸前。真嗣对此微微一笑，走到床边坐下，就在明日香旁边。她睡得很安详，真嗣凝视了她几秒钟，然后转而处理其他事情。他并不想叫醒她，但贴在她脚上的棉球需要更换。

Gently, he pushed against her shoulder, attempting to wake her. It took him several seconds before he roused her, and when he did, she sat up in a slow daze.

他轻轻地推了推她的肩膀，试图唤醒她。过了几秒钟，他才成功将她唤醒，而当她醒来时，她带着一丝迷茫缓缓坐起身来。

"Uhh...Shinji?" muttered Asuka as her vision came into focus, and she saw him sitting beside her.

"呃...真嗣？" 明日香喃喃自语，当她的视线逐渐清晰，看到他坐在她旁边。

"I think it's time I check your wound."

"我想是时候检查一下你的伤口了。"

"...Okay," said Asuka, yawning widely.

"...好吧，" 明日香打了个大大的哈欠说。

Carefully, Shinji undid the surgical tape wrapped around her foot, and removed the cotton ball that had been pressed against it. The cotton ball was dyed red, but new blood didn't flow forth from the wound at least. Hurrying downstairs, Shinji retrieved the tape and box of cotton where he had left it, and returned upstairs. As he began rewrapping her foot, Asuka seemed to finally overcome her sleepiness.

小心翼翼地，真嗣解开了缠绕在她脚上的手术胶带，并取出了压在伤口上的棉球。棉球已被染红，但至少没有新的血液从伤口流出。真嗣急忙下楼，取回他之前留下的胶带和棉球盒，然后返回楼上。当他开始重新包扎她的脚时，明日香似乎终于克服了睡意。

"Did you just get back?" she asked.

“你刚回来吗？”她问道。

"Yeah," Shinji nodded, focused on his work. "When I didn't see you on the couch, I was shocked at first, but eventually realized that you probably went upstairs."

“嗯，”真嗣点头，专注于手头的工作。“当我没在沙发上看到你时，一开始很震惊，但后来意识到你可能上楼了。”

"I just wanted to rest, and couldn't get comfortable on the couch, so I ended up walking up here."

"我只是想休息一下，但在沙发上怎么也躺不舒服，最后还是上楼来了。"

"Was it difficult?" "很难吗？"

"Not terribly. As long as I braced my hand against the railing, or the wall, I didn't have a problem walking on one leg for the time being. You did the same thing when your leg was broken afterall."

"倒也不算太难。只要用手撑着栏杆或者墙壁，暂时用一条腿走路也没问题。毕竟你腿骨折的时候也是这么做的。"

"True," mumbled Shinji. “确实。” 真嗣咕哝道。

Finishing his work, he stood up, and glanced down at Asuka. She seemed to be doing better than earlier, but that was just the outward appearance. He didn't know how she was feeling inside.

完成工作后，他站起身，瞥了一眼明日香。她看起来比之前好些了，但这只是表面现象。他并不知道她内心的感受。

"Hungry?" Shinji asked her.

"饿了？" 真嗣问她。

"Kinda, isn't it a bit early for dinner though?"

"有点，不过现在吃晚饭是不是有点早？"

"Yeah, but its okay. What do you want?"

"是啊，但没关系。你想吃什么？"

"Nothing in particular," said Asuka as she began to sit up, and then swung her legs over the side of the bed.

“没什么特别的，”明日香说着开始坐起身，然后双腿一摆，跨过床沿。

"Hang on Asuka. Once I'm done with whatever it is I end up making, I'll bring it up here."

“等等，明日香。等我做完手头上的事，我会把东西拿上来的。”

"Its not like I can't walk you know," groaned Asuka, "but...fine, I'll wait I suppose."

“我又不是不能走，你知道的，”明日香咕哝着，“不过……好吧，我等着就是了。”

"Alright," said Shinji as he turned and went downstairs, trying to decide what he wanted to make.

“好吧，”真嗣说着转身下楼，试图决定自己想做些什么。

Meanwhile, Asuka got back on her bed, and wrapped the covers around her. Being waited on like this by Shinji wasn't that bad, she had to admit.

与此同时，明日香回到床上，裹紧了被子。被真嗣这样伺候着，她不得不承认，感觉并不坏。

It wasn't very long before Shinji returned upstairs, so Asuka had to assume he hadn't cooked something very extravagant, at least by their standards. She was right, as Shinji brought up two sandwiches for her, and a cup of tea.

没过多久，真嗣就回到了楼上，所以明日香猜他应该没有做什么太奢侈的东西，至少按他们的标准来看是这样。她猜对了，真嗣给她带来了两个三明治和一杯茶。

"Aren't you going to have anything?" asked Asuka as Shinji handed her the plate.

"你不打算吃点什么吗？" 明日香接过盘子时问道。

"Nah, I'm not really hungry," answered Shinji.

"不了，我不是很饿，" 真嗣回答道。

"Suit yourself," said Asuka, as she dug into the small meal.

"随你吧，" 明日香说着，开始享用那小份餐食。

Shinji watched her eat silently, trying to imagine what she was thinking about. Asuka glanced several times at him, but she didn't say anything about his questioning gaze.

真嗣默默地看着她吃，试图想象她在想什么。明日香几次瞥向他，但对他探询的目光并未作声。

After she was done eating, she handed the plate to Shinji, which he took back downstairs. Sitting against the headboard of her bed, she sipped her tea slowly; she was beginning to feel tired again. It couldn't be very late after four p.m. but she was already feeling tired. Finishing her tea, she lay back down on her pillow, and closed her fluttering eyes slowly. How easy would it be to fall asleep right now...

吃完后，她把盘子递给真嗣，他接过后下楼去了。她靠在床头板上，慢慢啜饮着茶；她又开始感到疲倦了。尽管才下午四点后不久，但她已经感到疲惫。喝完茶，她躺回枕头上，缓缓闭上了扑闪的眼睛。此刻入睡会是多么容易……

When Shinji returned upstairs, Asuka was already fast asleep, breathing deeply. Shinji had given her a form of herbal tea, which helped to induce drowsiness. It was better for her to sleep right now.

当真嗣回到楼上时，明日香已经熟睡，呼吸深沉。真嗣给她喝了一种有助于催眠的草药茶，现在让她好好睡一觉更为妥当。

Shinji stayed beside her bed the remainder of the afternoon, until the sun had fully set. Closing his book that he had been reading when it finally became too dark, he walked downstairs, thinking to have his own dinner. But no, he didn't want to waste any time at this moment. He was going to spend as much time tonight as it took to find a gift for Asuka. Firstly, came his practice with his AT-field however.

整个下午，真嗣一直守在她的床边，直到太阳完全落下。当他终于觉得天色太暗，合上了正在阅读的书，走下楼去，打算吃自己的晚餐。但不行，他此刻不想浪费任何时间。他决定今晚要花尽可能多的时间来为明日香寻找一份礼物。首先，他得练习自己的 AT 力场。

Walking to the front door, he grabbed his jacket and stepped out into the frigid night. Shinji walked slowly, dragging his feet through the snow, his mind preoccupied. Shinji couldn't explain it, but he felt that his and Asuka's relationship was changing somehow. They had long since warmed up to each other, but it felt like there was something else there. Shinji felt a certain reaction in his stomach when he sometimes looked at Asuka. He didn't know what it was, but he couldn't call it unpleasant.

走到前门，他抓起外套，踏入了寒冷的夜晚。真嗣缓缓行走，拖着脚在雪地上，思绪纷乱。真嗣无法解释，但他感觉自己和明日香的关系正在以某种方式发生变化。他们早已彼此亲近，但似乎还有别的东西存在。有时看着明日香，真嗣会感到胃里一阵莫名的反应。他不知道那是什么，但绝非不愉快。

While still thinking about these things, he reached the end of the block, where he always practiced. For now, he would have to leave matters with Asuka aside. Concentrating on his AT-field was more important right now. Walking to the middle of the road, he projected his AT-field, slashing upwards towards the sky. His control was still shaky at best, but he wasn't getting as exhausted anymore at least.

尽管仍在思考这些事情，他已走到了常练习的街区尽头。眼下，他必须暂时搁置与明日香的事。此刻，专注于 AT 力场的控制更为重要。他走到路中央，展开 AT 力场，向天空挥斩。他的控制力依旧不稳，但至少不再像以前那样容易疲惫了。

He continued practicing, maintaining his AT-field for as long as he could, pushing himself to the limits. He tried the basic wall only once, but didn't feel any change within his control. It was still too powerful for him to control properly.

他继续练习，尽可能长时间地维持 AT 力场，不断挑战自己的极限。他只尝试了一次基础的墙壁形态，但并未感觉到控制上的变化。对他来说，这股力量依然过于强大，难以驾驭。

After another half hour of this, Shinji let his arms drop to the side. He didn't want to exhaust all his energy, since he planned on staying out late tonight. Walking down the middle of the street, he reached the recent neighborhood he had been scouring, and began his search anew.

又过了半小时，真嗣放下双臂，他不想耗尽所有精力，因为计划今晚在外面待到很晚。他沿着街道中央走到了最近一直在搜寻的街区，重新开始了搜索。

How long had it been? How many hours had passed since he begun? The night seemed endless, and yet, Shinji didn't mind this. If the darkness continued indefinitely, then he knew that he had more time to search.

已经过去多久了？自从他开始以来，已经流逝了多少小时？夜晚似乎无尽无边，然而，真嗣并不介意这一点。如果黑暗持续不断，那么他就知道，自己还有更多时间去寻找。

How many houses had he entered these past several hours? How many drawers had he gone through, pulling out peoples personal items, before throwing them to the side? When did he start simply going through the motions, without much sense of what he was doing? Why was he even here in the first place?

过去几个小时里，他闯入了多少户人家？翻阅了多少抽屉，拿出了多少人的私人物品，然后又随手丢弃？他何时开始只是机械地行动，对自己在做的事情几乎失去了感知？他究竟为何会来到这里？

It was far into the night now, and Shinji was sitting on the edge of the sidewalk, the silhouette of a house behind him. He had just finished going through it, if you could even call it that at this point, and was now resting on the sidewalk. He didn't know what time it was, but it had to be close to midnight by now.

夜已深，真嗣坐在人行道边，身后是一栋房屋的轮廓。他刚刚结束了那里的搜寻，如果这还能称之为搜寻的话，现在正坐在人行道上休息。他不知道具体时间，但想必已接近午夜。

He was exhausted and spent, on the verge of giving up. No matter where he looked, or what he did, he couldn't find a suitable gift for Asuka. Frustration seared into his mind, and Shinji suddenly stood up, angry that he couldn't accomplish this simple thing. How difficult was it to find a gift for her? It wasn't something that required a lot of thought, as long as it came from his heart.

他筋疲力尽，几乎要放弃了。无论他去哪里，做什么，都找不到适合送给明日香的一份礼物。挫败感灼烧着他的心智，真嗣突然站起身来，恼怒于自己连这么简单的事情都做不到。为她挑选礼物有多难？这并不需要太多思考，只要出自真心即可。

Stepping off the sidewalk, he walked across the street to the next house, intent on continuing his search. Shinji's footsteps stopped as he was halfway across the street however.

离开人行道，他穿过街道走向下一家，决心继续他的搜索。然而，当真嗣走到街道中央时，他的脚步突然停住了。

This sensation, it wasn't new to him by any means, but each time it happened, he still got a sense of dissonance. This vision, just as the one previously, was incredibly clear, and he could see everything that was happening. But, it was different than the last one. Before, he had watched Asuka die, but this was different. Nothing bad happened to her, nothing harmful happened; she didn't die, she didn't suffer any injuries. Her life seemed perfectly fine. Why was that?

这种感觉，对他来说并不陌生，但每次发生时，他仍然感到一种不协调。这次幻象，就像之前的那个一样，异常清晰，他能看到正在发生的一切。但是，它与上一次不同。之前，他目睹了明日香死去，但这次不同。她没有遭遇不幸，没有受到伤害；她没有死，也没有受伤。她的生活似乎完全正常。为什么会这样？

Asuka was older. She was taller, her hair was longer, and her body had clearly filled out in the years since she was a teenager. Something was different however, not just in the way she looked, but her personality as well. She seemed much friendlier, and she was smiling a lot as well. Shinji had never seen a side like this of Asuka; maybe occasionally she smiled, but she was never this friendly to Shinji. And speaking of which...

明日香长大了。她更高了，头发更长了，自从她还是个少女以来，她的身体明显成熟了许多。然而，有些东西不同了，不仅仅是她的外表，还有她的性格。她似乎更加友好，笑容也多了很多。真嗣从未见过明日香这一面；也许偶尔她会微笑，但她从未对真嗣如此友好。说到这里...

Shinji looked down at his own body, but there was no difference. So he wasn't here obviously, nor was he viewing it from somebody else's body. Why was he here in the first place then?

真嗣低头看着自己的身体，但没有任何变化。所以他显然不在这里，也没有从别人的身体里观看。那么他最初为什么会在这里呢？

Brief images flashed by of Asuka, but he didn't see himself in any of these glimpses. Was this it then? Was this were Asuka would be several years from now? Where was he? What was he doing? Was this even the world as he knew it? It was only a vision after all so-

阿斯卡的短暂影像闪过，但他没有在这些片段中看到自己。这就是了吗？这就是几年后的阿斯卡会变成的样子吗？他在哪里？他在做什么？这甚至是不是他所知道的世界？毕竟这只是一个幻象——

The image changed, and Shinji felt like he had suddenly been struck over the head with a large object. That...thing didn't even exist anymore. Asuka was still older, but she was clearly piloting an Evangelion, her Evangelion from what Shinji remembered her telling him. Why was she inside that thing again? Such a thing wasn't even possible! The Evangelions didn't exist anymore! What was she fighting!?

图像变了，真嗣感觉自己仿佛被一个重物猛击了头部。那...东西早已不复存在。明日香依然年长，但她显然正驾驶着一台 EVA，根据真嗣记忆中她所描述的，那是她的 EVA。为何她又回到了那东西里？这根本不可能！EVA 早已不复存在！她究竟在与何物战斗？！

The image grew blurry, and Shinji felt as though his head had split open. He had never felt pain like this because of his visions, and it wasn't even triggered by anything. Only darkness surrounded him, his entire vision being taken up by this darkness. What was this? What was going on? Why was he seeing these things? Was his other self trying to tell him something?

图像变得模糊，真嗣感觉自己的头仿佛裂开了一样。他从未因为这些幻象而感到如此剧痛，而且这并非由任何事物触发。四周只有黑暗环绕，他的整个视野都被这黑暗占据。这是什么？发生了什么？他为何会看到这些？是他的另一个自我在试图告诉他什么吗？

Shinji's vision came suddenly back to him, and he was standing in the middle of the dark street, snow surrounding him. His eyes were watery from the pain, and he reached up to touch his face, before he felt something else change; inexplicable anger filled him. He wanted to destroy something, anything, just so this feeling would disappear. Something was boiling to the surface within him, and Shinji didn't notice it, but his eyes turned blood red then.

真嗣的视野突然恢复，他发现自己站在漆黑的街道中央，四周被雪包围。剧痛让他的眼睛含泪，他伸手触摸脸颊，随即感到另一种变化；一股莫名的愤怒充斥心头。他想要摧毁什么，任何东西，只为让这种感觉消失。某种情绪在他内心沸腾，真嗣并未察觉，但他的眼睛随即变得血红。

As though some otherworldly force was controlling him, Shinji felt his body move without him controlling it. Next second, his AT-field was projected in front of him. The AT-field whipped outwards, striking the ground, and went soaring towards the house he had been about to enter. With an almighty crack, wooden beams splintered cleanly, as his AT-field ripped the house apart, cleaving a line straight down the middle.

仿佛某种超自然力量在操控着他，真嗣感觉到自己的身体不由自主地动了起来。下一秒，他的 AT 力场在他面前展开。AT 力场向外猛烈甩出，击中地面，并朝着他即将进入的那座房子疾驰而去。随着一声巨响，木梁被整齐地劈开，他的 AT 力场将房子撕裂，直直地从中劈开一条线。

His body turned, swinging his AT-field around, and crashed into the house beside it. His AT-field had changed, compressed down into the basic wall, and had collided against the house, crumpling it like a piece of paper. Shinji licked his lips with pleasure, but this wasn't enough destruction, far from it for that matter. Destroying objects and buildings just wasn't the same as the feel of flesh being ripped apart.

他的身体转动，挥舞着 AT 力场，猛地撞向旁边的房子。他的 AT 力场已经改变，压缩成基本的墙壁形态，与房子碰撞，将其像纸片一样压扁。真嗣舔了舔嘴唇，享受着这种快感，但这还远远不够，远远不足以与撕裂血肉的触感相提并论。摧毁物体和建筑，与那种感觉完全不同。

Thoughts entered Shinji's mind, unbidden by his own thoughts. An image surfaced in his mind, driven by whatever force had taken over his body. Heavy footsteps fell onto the snow, treading a familiar path to a certain house. With a single jump, a body flew into an upstairs window, crashing through the glass of the master bedroom. A single scream rang out in the darkness. The sound of a panicking voice, and then a single word spoken: Shinji. Without remorse or any sign of hesitation, a flash of orange erupted out of thin air, cleaving the entire house in two.

思绪涌入真嗣的脑海，不受他自身意志的控制。一幅画面在他心中浮现，由那股占据了他身体的未知力量所驱动。沉重的脚步踏在雪地上，沿着一条熟悉的路径走向某座房子。一跃而起，身体飞入二楼窗户，撞碎了主卧室的玻璃。黑暗中响起一声尖叫。随后是慌乱的声音，接着只听得一个字：真嗣。没有丝毫悔意或犹豫，一抹橙光凭空爆发，将整座房屋一分为二。

It was impossible, simply impossible that such a thing could happen. He couldn't let it happen, wouldn't let it happen.

这绝不可能，简直是不可能发生的事。他不能让它发生，也不会让它发生。

But he had no control over his body.

但他无法控制自己的身体。

Shinji took one step forward, and then another step forward, walking quite calmly through the snow, his blood red eyes gleaming clearly in the night. The sensation he had gotten before, he would soon feel again. This time, he wouldn't be held back. That part of his mind wasn't strong enough to contend with him anymore.

真嗣向前迈出一步，接着又是一步，非常平静地穿过雪地，他那血红色的眼睛在夜色中闪烁着清晰的光芒。之前感受到的那种感觉，他很快就会再次体会到。这一次，他不会被束缚。他内心那部分已经没有足够的力量与他抗衡了。

And he was right. Shinji couldn't do anything to stop this onslaught of death, and he felt himself sinking into darkness.

他是对的。真嗣无法阻止这场死亡的冲击，他感到自己正沉入黑暗之中。

Until his knees struck the asphalt.

直到他的膝盖撞上了柏油路面。

Shinji lay there, hunched on the ground, his knees bleeding from the impact with the asphalt. What had happened? What had-

真嗣就这样蜷缩在地上，膝盖因撞击柏油路面而流血。发生了什么？到底发生了什么——

Shinji vomited violently, stomach bile spilling across the ground and dribbling down his chin onto his shirt. Everything...everything

真嗣剧烈地呕吐起来，胃液洒了一地，顺着下巴滴到衬衫上。一切...一切

Slowly, Shinji tilted his head upwards, looking at the scenery around him. Every house was intact, without any sign that they had been destroyed by his AT-field. Then that entire time...

慢慢地，真嗣将头抬高，环顾四周的景色。每一栋房屋都完好无损，没有丝毫迹象表明它们曾被他的 AT 力场摧毁。那么那段时间……

Shinji started shaking uncontrollably, remembering what he had seen. The entire time, it had all been a vision. But to do something like that-

真嗣开始无法控制地颤抖，回想起他所见的一切。整个过程，那都只是一场幻象。但要做到那种事——

Shinji vomited again, feeling incredibly weak. Just the thought of what he had seen himself do, was enough to make him vomit. Why, why had he seen that!? Was he actually going to do something like that!? What was the purpose of seeing something like that!

真嗣再次呕吐，感到极度虚弱。仅仅是想到自己所见的那些行为，就足以让他呕吐。为什么，为什么他会看到那些！？他真的会做出那种事吗！？看到那样的景象究竟有何意义！

Even though his knees had already healed, Shinji struck his clenched fist against the ground as hard as he could. His knuckles burst open, spilling fresh blood on the ground, and revealing the white of the bone. Almost instantly, they began to heal, and Shinji hardly felt the sting of pain. But he didn't care, pain was what he needed right now.

尽管他的膝盖已经痊愈，真嗣还是用尽全力将紧握的拳头猛击地面。他的指关节破裂，鲜血洒落一地，露出了白色的骨头。几乎立刻，伤口开始愈合，真嗣几乎感觉不到疼痛的刺痛。但他并不在意，此刻他需要的就是疼痛。

What was up with the other stuff he had seen though? Asuka was older, and then she was piloting an Evangelion, and then-

但他看到的其他事情又是怎么回事呢？明日香年纪更大了，然后她在驾驶 EVA，然后——

No, don't think about that.

不，别去想那些。

But, they were all different, and yet all felt real at the same time. He had never seen multiple things at once before, and had always based his decision on what he had seen at the time. Does what he see actually happen, or is it only the possibility of happening? Why the possibility? Why not yes, or no? Positive or negative?

但它们各不相同，却又同时显得真实。他从未同时见过多个事物，总是基于当时所见来做决定。他所见的是否真的会发生，还是仅仅是一种可能？为何是可能？为何不是肯定或否定？正面或反面？

Human choices, choices which he could react to, or not react to. Ultimately, it was his decision to believe what he saw, and decide what course to take based on what he saw. Then, everything was simply a possibility, and based on the actions he took, would lead to one reality, or another. What he saw were the eventual outcomes of those realities. The first, Asuka older, but without Shinji in her life, she was living happily and safe. The middle, Asuka still piloting an Evangelion, but whether or not Shinji was in her life, wasn't shown. And the last...

人类的抉择，那些他可以回应或不回应的选择。最终，相信所见之物并据此决定行动方向，是他自己的决定。那时，一切仅是可能性，而他采取的行动将导向一种现实或另一种现实。他所见的是那些现实最终的结果。首先是，明日香年长，但生活中没有真嗣，她过得幸福且安全。中间的情况是，明日香仍在驾驶 EVA，但真嗣是否在她生活中并未展示。而最后...

The last was something that was always circling above Shinji. Whether or not he could control his AT-field, and what he was, from spiraling out of control. If it did, then he would certainly hurt Asuka.

最后一点是始终盘旋在真嗣头顶的问题。他能否控制自己的 AT 力场，以及他是什么，是否会失控。如果失控，那么他肯定会伤害到明日香。

This was a sobering thought, and Shinji continued sitting there in the middle of the street for several seconds. Based on what he had seen, for Asuka, the better outcome was for him to disappear from her life. But they were the only two people even left alive it seemed. Maybe it was selfish for Shinji to think this, but he didn't want to disappear from Asuka's life, even if his vision showed what was likely best. Asuka was, important to him, so...

这个想法让人清醒，真嗣继续坐在街道中央，好几秒钟一动不动。根据他所见，对明日香来说，更好的结果是他从她的生活中消失。但似乎他们是仅存的两个人。也许真嗣这样想很自私，但他不想从明日香的生活中消失，即使他的幻觉显示那可能是最好的选择。明日香对他来说，很重要，所以……

Shinji didn't know why, but he stood up then, and suddenly decided to project his AT-field. Whether it was because of his determination to remain with Asuka, or his wish to remain as he was, Shinji didn't feel any hesitation when he projected his AT-field. Somehow, his control was better now, and he didn't have any difficulties condensing the power down from his AT-field to a smaller form. He felt lighter in fact, almost like a feather floating in the wind.

真嗣不知道为什么，但他站了起来，突然决定展开自己的 AT 力场。无论是出于与明日香在一起的决心，还是希望保持自我，真嗣在展开 AT 力场时没有丝毫犹豫。不知为何，他现在的控制力更好了，将 AT 力场的力量凝聚成更小的形态也没有任何困难。他感觉自己轻如鸿毛，仿佛随风飘荡。

Shinji dissipated his AT-field, and looked down at his right hand. His AT-field, was in a sense, who he was. If he remained as he was currently, the same person that Asuka knew, he didn't see any complications in the future. He wanted to stay as he was, and remain beside her, but there was this other force that was trying to gain control over him.

真嗣散去了他的 AT 力场，低头凝视着自己的右手。某种意义上，AT 力场即是他自身的体现。若他能保持现状，依旧是那个明日香所熟知的他，未来似乎并无波折。他渴望维持原样，留在她身边，但另一股力量正试图掌控他。

'My angel half maybe,' thought Shinji. 'If thats really true.'

'我的天使半身或许吧，' 真嗣心想。'如果那真的是真的。'

He hadn't forgotten those red eyes he had seen, twice now for that matter. Was that happening to him, even though he didn't realize it? Did it happen every time he used his AT-field?

他并未忘记那双红色眼睛，至今已见过两次。即使他并未意识到，那是否正在发生在他身上？每次使用 AT 力场时都会发生吗？

Forcing himself to walk forward, Shinji reached the other side of the street, while pondering this. Glancing up to the house which he had seen himself destroy, he decided that he'd check this last house before returning back home. He had already decided to do so anyway, even before his vision had struck. He didn't have much hope, but nonetheless, he ventured forth into the house.

真嗣强迫自己向前走，穿过街道，同时思考着这个问题。抬头望向那座他曾目睹自己摧毁的房子，他决定在回家前检查这最后一座房子。即便在幻象出现之前，他就已经决定这么做了。尽管希望渺茫，他还是毅然踏入了那座房子。

Shinji spent longer in that house than he had intended, and when he finally returned back to his own home, it was with an additional weight in an inside pocket of his jacket.

真嗣在那栋房子里待的时间比他预期的要长，当他终于回到自己家时，夹克内袋里多了一份沉甸甸的东西。

### Chapter 17: Emotions

Here's the chapter for Christmas Eve. I got a lot to say, but I'll wait till tomorrow when I post the next chapter. And speaking of such, I should probably go finish it.

这是圣诞夜的chapter。我有很多话要说，但我会等到明天发布下一个chapter时再说。说到这个，我可能应该去完成它了。

---

A full week had passed since Shinji's excursion outside, in which he had been struck by a horrifying vision. He tried his best not to think about what he had seen, a possibility that could occur if he couldn't control his other self. He didn't speak about this to Asuka, nor that he had had gained greater control over his AT-field. Now, whenever she watched him practice, he made it look like he was having difficulties, but in reality, he didn't have any problems controlling it. During the days when she didn't, he practiced with his full force, projecting his AT-field across a wide area. He was still having some difficulties with the basic wall, but it wasn't pushing him back anymore. It was more a problem with his concentration now.

自从真嗣那次外出已经过去了一整周，那次他遭遇了一个可怕的幻象。他尽力不去想他所见到的，那是一个如果他无法控制另一个自我就可能发生的可能性。他没有向明日香提起这件事，也没有提到他对自己 AT 力场的控制力有所增强。现在，每当她看他练习时，他都装作很困难的样子，但实际上，他控制得很好。在她不在的日子里，他会全力练习，将自己的 AT 力场扩展到广阔的区域。他仍然在基本壁垒上有些困难，但这不再让他退缩。现在更多的是一个集中注意力的问题。

Asuka's foot hadn't become infected, and within a few days after the initial wound, she was insisting that she could walk outside again. Shinji knew from the look in her eyes as she looked at him then, that no matter what he said, she wouldn't listen to him. He suspected that she was putting on a brave front most of the time, and sometimes saw her wince, or stumble. Whenever she stumbled, Shinji usually offered his shoulder to her. Begrudgingly, she usually took him up on the offer.

明日香的脚并没有感染，最初的伤口几天后，她就坚持说自己可以再次外出行走了。碇真嗣从她当时看他的眼神中知道，无论他说什么，她都不会听他的。他怀疑她大部分时间都在强装勇敢，有时会看到她皱眉或踉跄。每当她踉跄时，真嗣通常会伸出肩膀给她扶。尽管不情愿，她通常还是会接受他的好意。

Other than that, there was of course the object that Shinji had found the same night in which he had that vision. It was a small thing, seemingly incredibly insignificant, but when Shinji had seen it, some part of him just thought of giving it to Asuka. There wasn't anything associated with it, that triggered some forgotten memory in him, but it was more on a whim than anything.

除此之外，当然还有真嗣在那晚看到幻象时发现的那件物品。它很小，看似极其微不足道，但当真嗣看到它时，内心某处就觉得应该把它送给明日香。它并没有唤起他遗忘的记忆，更多的是一时兴起。

After he had returned home that night, he stuffed the small package into his dresser drawer, burying it under the clothes he had accumulated. He didn't think Asuka was the type to go scouring through the house, looking for something that Shinji might have hidden from her, but he didn't want to take any chances. Wrapping it was more of a problem however. Shinji had never given a gift to anybody, and neither had he ever wrapped a Christmas present. Layering on the fact that he was keeping this a secret from Asuka, he could only wrap the gift at night, and finding wrapping paper itself had been difficult.

那晚回到家后，他将那个小包裹塞进了自己的抽屉里，压在他积攒的衣物下面。他不认为明日香会是那种会在屋里四处搜寻，找寻真嗣可能对她隐瞒的东西的人，但他不想冒险。然而，包装它是个更大的问题。真嗣从未给任何人送过礼物，也从未包装过圣诞礼物。再加上他要对明日香保密这一事实，他只能在夜里包装礼物，而找到包装纸本身就很困难。

The following day, Shinji had gone out earlier, combing through the houses he had visited in the past, before finding wrapping paper sufficient for the season. The wrapping paper was entirely red, with silver stars dotting the red here and there. It was simplistic, but Shinji thought that may be best.

第二天，真嗣早早出门，在他过去拜访过的房子里搜寻，直到找到适合这个季节的包装纸。那包装纸完全是红色的，银色的星星点缀在红色上，这里一点那里一点。虽然简单，但真嗣认为这可能是最好的选择。

That night, after Asuka had gone to bed, and Shinji had already finished his practice, he began attempting to wrap the gift downstairs. He messed up several times, crumpling the paper accidentally, but eventually managed to do an okay job. The package was so small, that he had decided to place it in something else, a rectangular cardboard box. Even by taking a brief glance at the shape of the gift, it was easy to guess what may be inside. With this, Asuka would have more questions about it.

那晚，在明日香已经上床睡觉，而真嗣也完成了练习后，他开始尝试在楼下包装礼物。他搞砸了好几次，不小心弄皱了包装纸，但最终还是勉强完成了。礼物实在太小，他决定将其放入一个长方形的纸板盒中。即便只是匆匆一瞥礼物的形状，也很容易猜到里面可能是什么。这样一来，明日香对此会有更多疑问。

Shinji was right, as the next morning, when Asuka went downstairs, her eyes passed over the tree, and locked onto the package underneath it. Shinji, who had been cooking breakfast, heard the sound of running feet, and just looked behind him to see Asuka breathing rather heavily. She had dragged him out into the living room, and began systematically shaking the package. Shinji was glad he hadn't left it loose in there, as it would have certainly rattled around. After doing this many times, Asuka finally gave up, but then stammered out an awkward thanks towards Shinji. He appreciated this, but didn't know what her reaction would be when she realized what he had gotten her.

正如真嗣所料，第二天早上，当明日香下楼时，她的目光掠过那棵树，随即锁定在树下的包裹上。正在做早餐的真嗣听到一阵急促的脚步声，回头一看，只见明日香喘着粗气。她把他拽到客厅，开始有条不紊地摇晃那个包裹。真嗣庆幸自己没有把它随意放置，否则肯定会发出声响。如此反复多次后，明日香终于放弃了，然后结结巴巴地向真嗣道了声尴尬的谢谢。他对此表示感激，但不知道她发现他送了什么礼物时会有何反应。

That was now four days ago, and it was the day before Christmas. Tension was high today, but not in an unpleasant manner. Every day since Asuka had seen her gift under the tree, with her name written on it in an untidy scrawl, she had shaken it every time like a little kid would, and today was no different. Shinji could even hear her humming to herself slightly as she did this, while he was working in the kitchen. They had just finished breakfast, and were preparing to go to the supermarket. Snow still covered the roads, but it hadn't snowed in two days, so they decided that right now was as best a time as any, to stock up on groceries.

那已经是四天前的事了，而今天是圣诞节前一天。今天的气氛很紧张，但并不令人不快。自从明日香在树下看到那个用潦草笔迹写着她名字的礼物后，她每天都像小孩子一样摇晃它，今天也不例外。甚至在厨房工作的真嗣都能听到她轻轻哼唱的声音。他们刚吃完早餐，正准备去超市。虽然路上还覆盖着雪，但已经两天没下雪了，所以他们认为现在是补货的最佳时机。

Walking into the living room, Shinji wiped his hands on a dishtowel, glancing over to where Asuka was kneeling.

走进客厅，真嗣用抹布擦了擦手，瞥向明日香跪着的地方。

"If you keep rattling it like that, you're gonna break it," exclaimed Shinji.

“你再这样摇下去，会把它弄坏的。”真嗣喊道。

"Then tell me what it is already," groaned Asuka.

“那就快告诉我是什么吧，”明日香抱怨道。

"Wouldn't you rather wait just one more day, and find out then?"

“你难道不想再多等一天，到时候再揭晓吗？”

Since Shinji had placed her gift under the tree, Asuka had attempted to wriggle any information about the gift from him. She had brought the subject up many times, entirely at random, hoping to startle him into telling her what it was. Shinji knew that Asuka was stubborn and determined, but he had never seen her like this before. She really was just like a little kid.

自从真嗣把她的礼物放在树下后，明日香就一直试图从他那里套出关于礼物的任何信息。她多次随机提起这个话题，希望能让他不小心说漏嘴。真嗣知道明日香固执且坚定，但他从未见过她这样。她真的就像个小孩子一样。

"Why can't I just open it now? One day isn't going to make a difference."

“为什么我现在不能打开它？一天的时间不会有什么区别的。”

"Tomorrow's Christmas, so you'll open it then," stated Shinji.

“明天是圣诞节，所以你到时候再打开。”真嗣说道。

Asuka let out a low sigh, before placing her present back under the tree. Standing up, she walked over to Shinji, and jabbed him lightly in the side.

明日香轻轻叹了口气，然后将礼物重新放回树下。她站起身，走到真嗣身边，轻轻戳了戳他的侧腰。

"What was that for?" asked Shinji, surprised by this.

“你这是干什么？”真嗣惊讶地问道。

"No reason," said Asuka, smirking slightly. "Are you done in the kitchen?"

“没什么，”明日香微微一笑，“你在厨房忙完了吗？”

"Yeah. I'm ready whenever you are, unless you want to spend some more time here instead."

“嗯，我随时都行，除非你想在这里多待一会儿。”

"I was only waiting for you idiot," muttered Asuka, as she looked away from him. Shinji raised an eyebrow, but didn't reply.

“我只是在等你这个白痴。”明日香嘟囔着，把目光从他身上移开。真嗣扬了扬眉毛，但没有回应。

Gathering up their sweatshirts, and the car keys, they stepped out into the frozen world.

他们拿起运动衫和车钥匙，踏入了冰封的世界。

Asuka drove carefully to the supermarket they always went to. The tires on their car weren't the best, and they didn't have four-wheel drive for the extra traction, so Asuka never went above twenty. The snow was powdery for the most part, and there wasn't any sign of ice, so sliding out of control wasn't a problem. That was the last thing they needed right now.

明日香小心翼翼地开车前往他们常去的超市。他们的车轮胎状况不佳，也没有四轮驱动来增加抓地力，所以明日香从未超过二十迈。大部分雪都是粉状的，没有结冰的迹象，所以失控打滑并不是问题。这是他们现在最不需要的麻烦。

Parking at the front of the store, they clambered out, Asuka throwing her hood over her head, attempting to block out a frigid breeze that just sprung up.

将车停在商店前，他们爬了出来，明日香把帽子甩到头上，试图挡住刚刚刮起的刺骨寒风。

"Know what you're getting?" asked Shinji.

“知道你要的是什么吗？”真嗣问道。

"More or less," nodded Asuka.

“或多或少吧，”明日香点头道。

Since Asuka was unable to find a present for Shinji, she decided that the least she could do was prepare dinner tomorrow. Today, they had come here mainly for that purpose, and Asuka had already compiled a list of things in her mind that she needed for dinner tomorrow. Shinji had offered to help her, but she had told him that this was her way of showing appreciation. Shrugging, Shinji just let her do as she pleased.

由于明日香找不到送给真嗣的礼物，她决定至少明天要准备一顿晚餐。今天他们来这里主要是为了这个目的，明日香已经在心里列出了明天晚餐所需的东西。真嗣提出帮忙，但她告诉他这是她表达感激的方式。真嗣耸耸肩，任由她按自己的意愿行事。

While Asuka walked up and down the isles, gathering up everything she needed, Shinji wandered the isles aimlessly, thinking to himself. Ever since that vision he had had, his AT-field wasn't as difficult to control. He could mold its shape, and in general, control it better than before. Did practicing ever have an actual affect, or by doing that, did Shinji feel better about himself?

当明日香在过道里来回走动，收集她所需的一切时，真嗣漫无目的地在过道中徘徊，心中思索着。自从那次幻象之后，他的 AT 力场不再那么难以控制。他能够塑造其形状，总体上比以前控制得更好。练习真的有实际效果吗，还是说这样做让真嗣自我感觉更好？

He hadn't forgotten about the vision he had, with the multiple possibilities within, but one thing bothered him. The last thing he had seen, when he went on a rampage was certainly disturbing, but seeing Asuka piloting an Evangelion while older, was just as strange. Firstly, the Evangelions didn't even exist anymore, or if they did, Shinji had no idea where they could be. Secondly, judging by what he had seen, it was easy to assume that close to four or five years had passed in that vision from this current time period. What was she fighting however? Where was Shinji in all this? It didn't make any sense to him.

他没有忘记那个幻象，其中包含的多种可能性，但有一件事困扰着他。最后看到的那一幕，当他陷入狂暴时确实令人不安，但看到明日香驾驶着一台更年长的 EVA，同样奇怪。首先，EVA 已经不存在了，或者即使存在，真嗣也不知道它们可能在哪儿。其次，根据他所见，很容易推测从现在起那幻象中过去了四五年。然而她在与什么战斗？真嗣在这其中又在哪里？这一切对他来说毫无意义。

"I'm done," came Asuka's voice from one of the other isles. Calling back to her, Shinji met her at the front entrance, and they walked to the car. Asuka refused to allow him to help load the car, so he instead had to wait patiently in the passenger seat while she did this. After she was done, she climbed back in the car and drove them home.

"我好了。" 明日香的声音从另一排货架传来。回应她的呼唤，真嗣在前门与她会合，两人一同走向车子。明日香拒绝让他帮忙装车，于是他只好耐心地坐在副驾驶座上等待。待她装载完毕，便回到车内，驾车载他们回家。

Shinji looked out his window, watching the snowy scenery slowly flashing by. It was hard to image they had been living here for over a month now. The time had gone by so quickly.

真嗣望向窗外，看着雪景缓缓掠过。很难想象他们已经在这里生活了一个多月。时间过得如此之快。

"What are you thinking about?" asked Asuka.

“你在想什么呢？”明日香问道。

"What makes you ask that?" said Shinji as he glanced at her.

“你怎么会这么问？”真嗣说着，瞥了她一眼。

"Shinji, I've been with you long enough now, to recognize when you're thinking."

“真嗣，和你相处这么久了，我已能察觉到你何时在思考。”

"Well, you're not wrong," sighed Shinji.

“嗯，你也没说错。” 真嗣叹了口气。

"So what is it?" "那到底是什么？"

"Nothing important, just surprised how long we've been here for."

"没什么重要的，只是惊讶我们在这里待了这么久。"

"Tokyo-2, or our house?" "东京-2，还是我们的家？"

"Both I suppose. I never imagined this far ahead, when we were still on the beach of Tokyo-3, that we would be here right now. Everything seems so unreal."

我想两者都有吧。在我们在第三新东京市的沙滩上时，我从未想过我们会走到今天这一步。一切都显得那么不真实。

"I suppose," shrugged Asuka. "You aren't getting bored of this place, are you?"

"我想也是，" 明日香耸了耸肩。"你没对这个地方感到厌倦吧？"

"No, and even if I was, we can't do much until the winter season ends."

"没有，即使我厌倦了，冬季结束前我们也做不了什么。"

"Well, we did say we'd stay here until then. Afterwards though," mumbled Asuka.

"嗯，我们确实说过会待到那时。不过之后嘛，" 明日香喃喃道。"

Both lapsed into silence, wondering about what the future would offer, and how their lives would be affected. Shinji had gotten tired of the rain and snow, and Tokyo-2 itself wasn't the brightest city in the world. But where else would they go?

两人都陷入了沉默，思索着未来会带来什么，以及他们的生活将如何受到影响。真嗣已经厌倦了雨雪，而东京-2 本身也不是世界上最光明的城市。但他们还能去哪儿呢？

Returning home, Asuka brought the groceries inside, and stored them away. Of course, Shinji wasn't allowed to help, so he waited on the couch until Asuka was done. It wasn't even noon yet, and Shinji was already getting bored. They had been outside in the snow many times, and it had lost its luster now.

回到家，明日香把买来的杂货搬进屋内，一一存放好。当然，真嗣是不被允许帮忙的，所以他坐在沙发上等明日香完成。还没到中午，真嗣就已经感到无聊了。他们曾在雪地里多次外出，现在这已经失去了它的魅力。

"You done in there yet?" asked Shinji from the couch.

“你那边弄完了吗？”真嗣从沙发上问道。

"Why?" Asuka returned his call.

"为什么？" 明日香回拨了他的电话。

"No reason," mumbled Shinji. Just having Asuka in his presence alleviated some of his boredom.

"没什么理由，" 真嗣咕哝着。只是有明日香在身边，他的无聊感就减轻了一些。

"Well, I am almost done I suppose," said Asuka, as she sound of drawers closing could be heard.

"嗯，我想我差不多快弄完了，" 明日香说，同时可以听到抽屉关闭的声音。

Several minutes later, Asuka walked into the living room, sitting down next to Shinji. Stretching, she pulled off her sweatshirt, tossing it on the floor beside her, and then carefully pulled off her socks. Her foot was still wrapped in surgical tape, but any possible bleeding had stopped a long time ago.

几分钟后，明日香走进客厅，坐在真嗣旁边。她伸了个懒腰，脱下运动衫，随手扔在脚边的地板上，然后小心翼翼地脱掉袜子。她的脚仍裹着手术胶带，但可能的出血早已止住很久了。

"How does it feel?" asked Shinji.

“感觉怎么样？” 真嗣问道。

"Hurts a little, but thats natural I suppose," sighed Asuka as she began unwrapping her foot. It was likely that she would have a scar now, but Asuka didn't complain about this. It was afterall on the bottom of her foot, something which was rarely seen. If it had been her face, that would have been a different story.

“有点疼，但我想这是正常的，” 明日香叹了口气，开始解开脚上的绷带。她很可能会留下疤痕，但明日香对此并不抱怨。毕竟是在脚底，很少会被人看到。如果是脸上，那可就是另一回事了。

"Can you get the tape out of my room? I think I left it up there," said Asuka.

“你能去我房间把胶带拿出来吗？我想我把它落在那儿了，” 明日香说道。

"Yeah," nodded Shinji. “嗯，”真嗣点头道。

Walking upstairs, he entered Asuka's room, and spotted the roll of tape on the table beside her bed. Not lingering for long, he returned back downstairs, and handed the item to Asuka, before sitting back beside her.

他走上楼，进入明日香的房间，一眼就看到了她床边桌上的胶带卷。他没有久留，迅速回到楼下，将胶带递给明日香，然后又坐回她身边。

Placing a new cotton ball against her wound, she began rewrapping the surgical tape around her foot, and then tore off the end, finishing her job.

她将一个新的棉球放在伤口上，开始用手术胶带重新包扎她的脚，然后撕下末端，完成了包扎。

"Thats better," said Asuka as she placed her foot back on the ground. She didn't bother putting her sock back on. Glancing over at her, Shinji watched her wiggle her toes for several seconds before looking the other way.

“这样好多了，”明日香说着，把脚放回地面。她懒得再穿回袜子。瞥了她一眼，真嗣看着她动了动脚趾，几秒钟后才移开视线。

"So, what did you want to do today?" asked Shinji.

"那么，你今天想做什么呢？" 真嗣问道。

"I don't know," replied Asuka. "There wasn't anything I had in mind. Did you want to go outside?"

“我不知道，”明日香回答，“我没什么特别想去的地方。你想出去吗？”

"No, not really," said Shinji truthfully. "However-"

“不，其实并不想，”真嗣诚实地回答，“不过——”

Shinji's words were cut off, as an almighty crashed resounded from somewhere. They both jumped up instantly, surprised by this sudden noise. It wasn't anything in there vicinity, but the noise had ricochet off the many surrounding houses. Whatever it had been, it had come from several blocks away.

真嗣的话音戛然而止，因为某个地方突然传来一声震耳欲聋的巨响。两人顿时惊跳起来，被这突如其来的声响吓了一跳。声音并非来自附近，而是从众多环绕的房屋间反弹而来。无论那是什么，它都来自几个街区之外。

Throwing on their sweatshirts again, Shinji and Asuka walked out into the frozen winter world, Asuka leaning on Shinji's shoulder. A large cloud of dust could be seen hovering in the distance, far down the road from where they stood. Glancing at each other, they nodded, deciding to go investigate.

再次披上运动衫，真嗣和明日香走进了冰封的冬日世界，明日香倚靠在真嗣的肩头。远处，一团巨大的尘埃云悬浮在道路尽头，距离他们所站之处甚远。两人对视一眼，点头决定前去探查。

They walked down the street, passing Shinji's training spot, and continued down the road past the street light. As the walked across the street, they could see what had happened from a distance. A tree, apparently weighed down with all the extra snow, had collapsed on a house, crushing it flat. As they neared closer, the remains of a car in the driveway could barely be seen crushed under the trunk of the tree. Splintered pieces of wood littered the front lawn, and the place where the tree had been uprooted was now a giant pit in the earth. Shinji hadn't thought about what the extra weighed on the trees could potentially do, but if the tree was rotted slightly, then this could be the end result.

他们沿着街道走下去，经过真嗣的训练地点，继续前行，经过路灯。当他们穿过街道时，从远处就能看到发生了什么。一棵树，显然是被额外的积雪压垮，倒塌在一座房子上，将其压得面目全非。他们走近时，车道上被压在树干下的汽车残骸隐约可见。碎木片散落在草坪上，而树被连根拔起的地方现在成了一个大坑。真嗣之前并未考虑过树木额外负重可能带来的后果，但如果树木稍有腐朽，这可能就是最终的结果。

"Lets head back," mumbled Asuka.

“我们回去吧，”明日香咕哝道。

Shinji had to agree with her; their house didn't have any trees nearby at least.

真嗣不得不赞同她；至少他们的房子附近没有树。

Slowly, they turned away, and began heading back, not noticing the damaged telephone pole above them. When the tree had fallen, it fell in such a way, that some of its lower branches had knocked against the telephone pole, tilting the pole. Gravity did the rest.

他们缓缓转身，开始往回走，没有注意到头顶上损坏的电线杆。当那棵树倒下时，它的下枝以某种方式撞击了电线杆，使其倾斜。重力完成了剩下的工作。

The sound of roots being torn from the earth, is much more fierce then a large pole coming dislodged from the ground, and this seconds gap in realization was enough so that Shinji and Asuka were unable to move out of the way. The pole came tumbling down, its shadow growing closer to the ground, gathering speed as it fell to the earth. Asuka began opening her mouth in a shrill scream, but Shinji hardly moved a muscle. A three seconds decision was all that was afforded to him. Ultimately, he had two choices. To let this happen, or to stop it. Neither vision, nor some other force would tell him which was right however, as that came naturally to him.

根系被从大地生生撕裂的声音，远比一根巨木从地面松脱更为猛烈，而这短短一瞬的认知空白，已足够让真嗣和明日香无法及时闪避。那根巨木轰然倒下，阴影在地面上迅速逼近，随着坠落加速。明日香张嘴欲发出尖叫，但真嗣几乎纹丝未动。留给他的，仅是一个三秒的决定。最终，他面临两个选择：任其发生，或是阻止它。然而，无论是视觉还是其他力量，都无法告诉他哪个是正确的，因为这选择对他而言是自然而然的。

His AT-field exploded outward, enveloping himself and Asuka, creating a dome around them. The orange dome surrounded them, protecting them from the fallen telephone pole as it came crashing down to the earth. As it collided with Shinji's AT-field, it stopped dead in its tracks, but this force wasn't what Shinji had expected. He had been practicing with his AT-field for a long time, but this was the first time he had come into contact with another object using his AT-field. There was a certain weight to the telephone pole, but it wasn't crushing him. His own AT-field had done that to him in the past, but he could control it properly now.

他的 AT 力场猛然向外爆发，将他和明日香包裹其中，形成一个穹顶。橙色的穹顶环绕着他们，当那根倒下的电线杆轰然坠地时，保护他们免受其害。电线杆撞击到真嗣的 AT 力场时，戛然而止，但这股力量并非真嗣所预料的。他长时间练习使用 AT 力场，但这是第一次用它接触到其他物体。电线杆有一定的重量，却并未压垮他。过去他的 AT 力场曾让他承受过重压，但现在他能妥善控制了。

"...Shinji..." mumbled Asuka from somewhere beside him, but he didn't pay her any attention right now. What came next was important.

“...真嗣...”明日香在他身旁某处咕哝着，但他此刻无暇顾及她。接下来才是关键。

During the nights when Asuka didn't watch him, he had tested out his AT-field, attempting to conjure up anything that his mind could fathom. His AT-field was a single entity however, and couldn't exist in two places simultaneously, which is why controlling it instantaneously was important. If he changed his AT-field, the pole would come collapsing towards them again, and it was too close for comfort.

在明日香不监视他的夜晚，他尝试过测试自己的 AT 力场，试图凭空想象出任何心灵所能构思的事物。然而，他的 AT 力场是一个单一实体，无法同时存在于两个地方，因此即时控制它显得尤为重要。如果他改变 AT 力场，那根杆子就会再次向他们倒下，距离太近令人不安。

Making his decision, and hoping that it was the right one, Shinji dissipated his AT-field, and then reprojected it a second later. The flash of orange happened, and Shinji's AT-field erupted in front of him, in the form of the standard wall. If he had cut the pole in half, the chance of it falling on them was still possible, so this was currently the safest bet. Still, Shinji couldn't maintain this for long.

做出决定，并希望这是正确的选择，真嗣散去了他的 AT 力场，然后在一秒后重新展开。橙色的闪光出现，真嗣的 AT 力场在他面前爆发，形成标准的墙壁形态。即使他切断了杆子，它仍有可能会倒向他们，所以目前这是最安全的办法。不过，真嗣无法长时间维持这种状态。

Forcing his AT-field against the pole, he slowly began to bear down on it, crushing it to pieces like he had seen his other self do in his vision. The wood splintered and collapsed in on itself, being crushed in midair until there wasn't anything left.

他用力将 AT 力场施加在杆子上，慢慢地开始施压，将其碾碎成片，就像他在幻象中看到另一个自己所做的那样。木头裂开并自行塌陷，在空中被碾压直至什么都不剩。

Dissipating his AT-field, Shinji collapsed on the spot, sinking to his knees. His first time using his AT-field for both protection and destruction; it was a strange feeling certainly.

散去 AT 力场后，真嗣当场瘫倒，跪在地上。这是他第一次同时用 AT 力场进行防御和破坏；确实是一种奇妙的感觉。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

Glancing behind him, he didn't realize it, but Asuka's face was a mere inches away from his. During the entirety of this, Shinji hadn't realized it, but Asuka had been clutching onto his arm, afraid of the situation.

回头一瞥，他并未察觉，但明日香的脸庞仅离他咫尺之遥。整个过程中，真嗣浑然不觉，明日香却紧抓着他的手臂，对这情形心生畏惧。

"Asuka...um..." "明日香...嗯..."

Asuka didn't reply, but continued to just stare back at him. Was she staring at what he thought she was staring at.

明日香没有回答，只是继续盯着他。她是在看他以为她在看的东西吗？

"Hey Asuka...are my eyes red right now?"

“嘿，明日香……我的眼睛现在是不是红了？”

It took her several seconds to reply 'yes.'

她过了好几秒才回答‘是的’。

"I see," muttered Shinji. "What do you think of this?"

"我明白了，" 真嗣低声说道。"你觉得这怎么样？"

"I don't know," Asuka finally spoke. "I've seen those red eyes before, when you first showed me your AT-field."

"我不知道，" 明日香终于开口了。"我以前见过那种红眼睛，就在你第一次向我展示你的 AT 力场时。"

"And you didn't think it mattered to tell me this?" asked Shinji, feeling slightly hurt.

"你当时没觉得有必要告诉我这些吗？" 真嗣问道，感到有些受伤。"

Hanging her head, Asuka mumbled, "I convinced myself that it wasn't important, but I suppose that was wrong of me."

低着头，明日香喃喃自语道：“我曾说服自己这并不重要，但我想我错了。”

As to that, Shinji didn't have a comment for. Whether she was right or wrong, didn't matter anymore. Shinji had discovered it on his own anyway.

至于那个，真嗣没有评论。无论她是对是错，都不再重要了。真嗣反正已经自己发现了。

"They are changing back to the normal brown however," said Asuka.

"不过它们正在变回正常的棕色，" 明日香说道。

"Well thats good at least," said Shinji. Asuka was still clutching his arm, and it was making him rather uncomfortable now. He was aware of the warmth emanating off her body, as well as the small bulge of her chest he could feel through her sweatshirt.

"那至少是件好事，" 真嗣说。明日香仍然紧抓着他的手臂，这让他现在感到相当不自在。他能感觉到从她身体散发出的温暖，以及透过她运动衫能感受到的她胸部的微微隆起。

"Asuka...could you let go-" but she cut him off instead.

"明日香...你能放开-" 但她打断了他。

"Shinji, have you been holding back whenever I watch you practice?"

“真嗣，每次我看你练习的时候，你是不是都在保留实力？”

There it was; this is what she had been really wondering about. Shinji could never fool Asuka indefinitely.

她终于问出了这个真正困扰她的问题。真嗣永远无法长久地欺骗明日香。

Scratching the back of his head with his free hand, he said awkwardly, "Yeah...I was."

他用空着的那只手尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺，说道：“嗯……是的。”

"Why? Have you been this powerful the entire time, and just not been showing me because of...some sort of protection, or-"

"为什么？你一直这么强大，只是因为某种保护措施而没有展示给我看，还是……"

"No, nothing like that. My control, improved suddenly though, and I didn't want to scare you because of the change in my AT-field."

"不，不是那样的。只是我的控制力突然提升了，我不想因为 AT 力场的变化吓到你。"

Asuka didn't reply, but she did finally let go of his arm, and walked several paces away from him. At first, Shinji thought that she was backing away from him, because she was now afraid of him, but his worries vanished when she smiled at him.

明日香没有回答，但她终于放开了他的手臂，走开了几步。起初，真嗣以为她是在远离他，因为她现在害怕他，但当她对他微笑时，他的担忧消失了。

"I think this was more scary then simply showing me the change in your AT-field. Either way, I suppose its a good thing. But why the sudden change in the first place?"

"我觉得这比直接展示你 AT 力场的变化更吓人。无论如何，我想这是件好事。但为什么一开始会有这种突然的变化呢？"

Shinji was wondering if it was coming to this, but knew that if he didn't explain, Asuka would grow angry at him. Sure enough, in the few seconds pause he hadn't said anything, Asuka had walked over to him, and was glaring up at him.

真嗣在想是不是会发展到这一步，但他知道如果不解释，明日香会对他生气。果然，在他沉默的几秒钟里，明日香已经走到他面前，抬头瞪着他。

"Well?" she asked. “那么？”她问道。

Shinji glanced back down at her glaring eyes. There was a limit to what he could say, and what he couldn't; he certainly knew this. Explaining it all to Asuka would take sometime however.

真嗣再次瞥向她那怒视的双眼。有些话他能说，有些则不能；他当然明白这一点。但要向明日香解释这一切，还需要一些时间。

"Walk with me for a bit," mumbled Shinji as he turned away from her.

“陪我走一会儿吧，”真嗣咕哝着，转身离开了她。

Asuka thought that his intentions differed from hers however, because she grabbed onto his wrist, and held him in place.

明日香认为他的意图与她的不同，因为她抓住了他的手腕，将他固定在原地。

"Are you avoiding the subject?" she asked.

“你在回避这个话题吗？”她问道。

"No, but I would like to talk to you about this while we walk I guess."

“不，但我想在我们散步的时候和你谈谈这个。”

"Why couldn't we just go back home instead where it's warm?"

“我们为什么不直接回家呢？那里暖和多了。”

"No real reason. Just a whim I guess," he said with a small smile.

“没什么特别的原因，大概只是一时兴起。”他带着一丝微笑说道。

Without having any other options, Asuka had to agree to this, even if she didn't relish the idea. The telephone pole collapsing had already been purged from her memory, but the feeling she had gotten when Shinji projected his AT-field around them, protecting them from the possibility of death. Asuka had never been close enough to Shinji's AT-field to really feel its intensity, but now she understood just how powerful it was. Not only that, but she could sense something else in that moment. A desire to protect her, was the simplest way that Asuka could explain what she had gathered from Shinji's AT-field. It was like Shinji himself was protecting her in that moment.

别无选择之下，明日香不得不答应，尽管她并不喜欢这个主意。电话杆倒塌的记忆已被她抹去，但当真嗣展开他的 AT 力场，保护他们免于死亡威胁的那一刻，她所感受到的情感却挥之不去。明日香从未如此近距离地感受过真嗣的 AT 力场，如今她才真正体会到它的强大。不仅如此，她还在那一刻察觉到了别的东西。最简单的解释，就是真嗣想要保护她。仿佛在那一刻，真嗣本人就在守护着她。

As they continued walking, Shinji began to tell Asuka the events that had happened a week ago, when he was still desperately searching for some sort of gift for her. He told her about the vision he had had, of herself seemingly older, happy, at peace in the world. Next, he told her about what he had seen about the Evangelions, how she was piloting one, even though she appeared older. As to this, Asuka didn't have any idea what it meant, but she did have something to say about the previous vision.

他们继续前行，真嗣开始向明日香讲述一周前发生的事，那时他还在拼命寻找给她的一份礼物。他向她描述了自己所见的幻象，幻象中的她似乎年长了一些，快乐而平和地生活着。接着，他谈到了关于福音战士的所见，尽管她看起来更年长，却仍在驾驶一台。对此，明日香并不明白这意味着什么，但她对之前的幻象有些话要说。

"So why did I seem so happy?" asked Asuka as she stopped walking.

“那我为什么看起来这么高兴呢？”明日香停下脚步问道。

"I don't know," mumbled Shinji, but Asuka didn't buy this.

"我不知道，" 真嗣嘟囔着，但明日香并不相信。

"You do, but you just don't want to admit it."

"你知道，只是不想承认罢了。"

She was right of course, and the expression on Shinji's face showed this. He had already made his decision, that he wouldn't be leaving Asuka's side, thereby negating that possibility, but again, this was just his selfish desire. How did Asuka actually feel about this?

她当然是对的，真嗣脸上的表情说明了这一点。他已经做出了决定，不会离开明日香的身边，从而否定了那种可能性，但这只是他自私的愿望。明日香对此到底是怎么想的呢？

"From what I could tell, judging by what I saw, I was no longer in your life, and therefore, you were happy."

"从我所见来看，我已不在你的生活中，因此，你应该是快乐的。"

"What kind of shit is that?"

"这是什么鬼话？"

Asuka stated this almost matter-of-factly, like such a thing was utterly ridiculous.

明日香几乎是理所当然地说出这话，仿佛这种想法荒谬至极。

"Shinji, do you not think I'm happy right now?" asked Asuka.

"真嗣，你不觉得我现在很幸福吗？" 明日香问道。

"...I don't know," admitted Shinji. "I'd like to think so, but I honestly don't know."

"...我不知道，" 真嗣承认道。"我愿意这么想，但老实说我并不确定。"

"Do you think I would be happy if you suddenly disappeared from my sight?"

"如果你突然从我眼前消失，你觉得我会快乐吗？"

"I'm only going based on what I saw."

"我只是根据我所看到的来判断。"

"They're just visions Shinji. Are they actually set in stone?"

"那些只是幻象，真嗣。它们真的就是板上钉钉的事吗？"

No, she was right about this, but they still existed as a possibility. Whether it could happen or not, wasn't of course dictated solely by Shinji. He could do his best to steer away from that reality, but if Asuka's opinion differed from him, then the whole thing could fall apart.

不，她在这点上是正确的，但它们仍然只是一种可能性。是否会发生，当然不仅仅取决于真嗣。他可以尽最大努力避开那种现实，但如果明日香的观点与他不同，那么整个事情就可能崩溃。

"They're possibilities, which may, or may not occur, depending on what choices I make."

“它们是可能性，可能会发生，也可能不会，取决于我做出的选择。”

"But you're afraid that I may want that reality, that whatever else could be waiting for us, is worse for me, than that possibility which you saw."

“但你担心我可能想要那个现实，无论还有什么在等着我们，对我来说都比你所看到的那种可能性更糟糕。”

She was correct of course, but Shinji didn't say anything.

她当然是对的，但真嗣什么也没说。

"Shinji, whatever may happen to us down the road," continued Asuka, "I can make my own decisions right now about whether I'm happy or not. Truthfully, I can't say whether I am or not right now, but I know I wouldn't be happy if you were to suddenly disappear. That vision, reality, possibility, or whatever it is, isn't something that I want to happen. Besides, if you aren't here, who would make breakfast every morning."

"真嗣，无论未来我们将会经历什么，"明日香继续说道，"我现在可以自己决定是否感到幸福。说实话，我无法确定此刻我是否幸福，但我知道如果你突然消失，我肯定不会快乐。那个幻象，现实，可能性，或是其他什么，都不是我希望发生的。而且，如果你不在这里，谁还会每天早上给我做早餐呢。"

'So thats what it came down to,' thought Shinji with a small sigh. He wondered though, the reasoning behind Asuka's decision. She said that she wouldn't be happy if he was to suddenly disappear from her sight, so what did that basically mean?

'原来这就是最终结果啊，' 真嗣轻叹一声，心中却仍疑惑着明日香的决定背后的缘由。她说如果他突然从她视线中消失，她会不开心，那这究竟意味着什么呢？

"What about the Evangelion thing then?" asked Shinji. "If my visions show me possibilities of the future, does that possibility exist, that you could be piloting one again?"

“那关于《新世纪福音战士》的事呢？”真嗣问道，“如果我的幻象向我展示了未来的可能性，这是否意味着存在一种可能，你还能再次驾驶一台？”

"I don't see how thats possible at all. Logically, the Angels would have to return, and I'm guessing that because of Third Impact, that won't happen. Not to mention that there doesn't seem to be any other humans around. Maybe there's something else that we aren't understanding."

“我不明白那怎么可能。从逻辑上讲，使徒必须会回来，但我猜因为第三次冲击，这不会发生。更不用说周围似乎没有其他人类。也许有些事情我们还没有理解。”

"Maybe," muttered Shinji.

“也许吧，”真嗣低声说道。

They lapsed into silence, both absorbed in each others thoughts. Shinji was thinking back to that night a week ago, when he had witnessed the horrific thing his other self had done. Did that possibility still exist, or had he overcome his other selfs sway? He could sometimes sense another voice calling to him, especially during the times when he used his AT-field.

他们陷入了沉默，各自沉浸在自己的思绪中。真嗣回想起一周前那个夜晚，他目睹了另一个自己所做的可怕事情。那种可能性还存在吗，还是他已经克服了另一个自己的影响？他有时能感觉到另一个声音在呼唤他，尤其是在他使用 AT 力场的时候。

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka suddenly.

“嘿，真嗣？”明日香突然问道。

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Since you were out searching for a gift for me, did you find it in that house?"

"既然你出去为我找礼物了，是在那房子里找到的吗？"

Shinji was surprised that she could put the brief mentions of the house he had been about to enter, together with the timeline of when her gift had shown up under the tree. There wasn't any reason for him to refute this, so he just nodded, admitting it. Seeing this as a chance however, Asuka began questioning him about its contents again. Asuka continued badgering him, as they began the return journey to their house.

真嗣惊讶于她能将他即将进入那所房子的简短提及与她礼物出现在树下的时间线联系起来。他没有理由反驳这一点，所以他只是点头承认了。然而，看到这是一个机会，明日香又开始追问他房子的内容。他们开始返回家中，明日香继续纠缠不休。

Even with the excitement of the morning, the afternoon dragged by slowly, as Shinji and Asuka wasted away the remaining hours of the day. Asuka took a bath upstairs in her bathroom, using the accumulated water they had gathered from the grocery store, as well as from the buckets outside. It was cold, but it was still warmer than standing naked outside in the snow..

尽管早晨充满了兴奋，下午却缓慢地拖着，真嗣和明日香浪费了剩下的时间。明日香在楼上的浴室里洗澡，使用了从杂货店和外面的桶里收集的水。水很冷，但仍然比光着身子站在雪地里暖和。

Shinji lay lengthwise on the couch, reading a book and enjoying the warmth of the fireplace. He had already read this book multiple times, but it was at least something to pass the time. Hearing footsteps, he glanced behind him to see Asuka just reaching the bottom landing of the stairs. She was drying her hair off with a towel, but she was clad in nothing but a loose tank-top, and shorts. A month ago, Asuka would never have walked into the same room as Shinji looking like this, but at some point, she had just stopped caring. Course, there were still limits.

真嗣横躺在沙发上，读着一本书，享受着壁炉的温暖。这本书他已经读过多次，但至少可以打发时间。听到脚步声，他回头一看，只见明日香刚走到楼梯底部。她正用毛巾擦干头发，但身上只穿着一件宽松的背心和短裤。一个月前，明日香绝不会这样走进有真嗣在的房间，但不知何时起，她已经不再在意了。当然，还是有底线的。

Sitting down in front of the fireplace, Asuka continued drying her hair, aware of Shinji's gaze from the couch. Well, she couldn't really blame him, she supposed.

明日香坐在壁炉前继续擦干头发，感觉到真嗣从沙发上投来的目光。嗯，她想，也不能怪他。

Finished with drying her hair, Asuka shifted over to the tree, and picked up her gift again, looking down at it. It was hard to express her feelings over receiving something of this nature, even though she didn't know what its contents contained. She had received presents before over the course of her life, but nothing really memorable. This was something that Shinji had gotten for her, with his thoughts focused on what she would most like. She knew that he had a lot of difficulties finding something, so she wondered what had made him choose whatever this was. Either way, she'd find out tomorrow.

吹干头发后，明日香挪到树旁，再次拿起礼物，低头凝视。收到这样一份礼物，她的心情难以言表，尽管她并不知道里面装着什么。她一生中收到过不少礼物，但真正难忘的却寥寥无几。这是真嗣为她精心挑选的，全心全意想着她最喜爱的东西。她知道他为寻找合适的礼物费尽心思，因此好奇究竟是什么让他做出了这个选择。无论如何，明天一切自会揭晓。

Standing up, she moved away from the tree, and sat down on the couch beside Shinji.

她站起身，离开了那棵树，坐在了真嗣旁边的沙发上。

"Still wondering what it is?" said Shinji from his side of the couch.

“还在想那是什么吗？”真嗣从沙发另一侧说道。

"How could I not be," Asuka replied, with a small sigh. "I better not be disappointed."

“我怎么能不感到好奇呢，”明日香轻叹一声回答，“希望不要让我失望。”

"I'm not making any promises," shrugged Shinji. "Though it is something I think you'll like."

"我不会做出任何承诺，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"不过我觉得你会喜欢的。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"I don't know, but when I saw it, I just had this feeling I guess you could say."

"我不确定，但当我看到它时，我就有种感觉，可以说是直觉吧。"

"Getting me something just because you had a feeling," grumbled Asuka, not happy about this explanation. Still, she couldn't deny that she was excited for tomorrow, and she had her own duty to perform as well, since she hadn't managed to get anything for Shinji. She already knew what she wanted to cook, even though the preparation would take some time.

"就因为你有种感觉就给我买东西，"明日香咕哝着，对这个解释并不满意。尽管如此，她无法否认自己对明天充满期待，而且她也有自己的任务要完成，毕竟她还没能给真嗣准备什么。她已经想好了要做什么菜，尽管准备工作会花些时间。

A chill suddenly ran up her spine, and she shivered from it. The living room was warm, but her body was still cold from the bath. Well, she could either change into something warmer, but she didn't really want to leave the couch. Making a decision, she stood up and went to the closet near the front door. They kept some blankets in there for times like these.

一股寒意突然沿着她的脊背升起，让她不由自主地颤抖。客厅里很暖和，但她的身体仍因刚洗完澡而感到寒冷。好吧，她可以选择换上更暖和的衣服，但她实在不想离开沙发。做出决定后，她站起身，走向前门附近的衣柜。他们会在那里存放一些毯子，以备不时之需。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji, as he watched her. His question was answered seconds later, as Asuka returned with a bundle of blankets. Without warning him, Asuka tossed the blankets at Shinji, covering him in them, and then sat down beside him. Muttering slightly, Shinji removed the blankets from him, but predicting what Asuka, wanted covered her with one of the larger blankets.

“你在做什么？”真嗣看着她问道。几秒钟后，答案揭晓了，因为明日香抱着一捆毯子回来了。没等他反应过来，明日香就把毯子扔向真嗣，将他裹了个严实，然后坐在他旁边。真嗣小声嘀咕着，从自己身上扯下毯子，但预料到明日香的意图，他用其中一条大毯子盖住了她。

"Happy?" asked Shinji. “满意了吗？”真嗣问道。

Asuka didn't reply, and her face was turned away from his. The blanket that Shinji had thrown at her was far to large for her own body, and so Asuka offered the empty space to him.

明日香没有回答，她的脸转向了另一边。真嗣扔给她的毯子对她来说太大了，于是明日香把多余的部分让给了他。

"I'm not really cold," Shinji said, wondering why Asuka was acting so strange.

“我其实不太冷，”真嗣说，疑惑着明日香为何表现得如此奇怪。

"Well I am," muttered Asuka after a seconds pause.

“好吧，我冷，”明日香在片刻停顿后咕哝道。

'Ah, so thats what she was getting at,' thought Shinji. It had been a long time since they had kept warm like this together. During the days when they slept in the tent, it was natural to be sleeping against each others back, to keep warm. While still the same principle, Shinji couldn't remember a time when they had sat directly next to each other, their bodies leaning against each other, while a warm blanket enveloped them. Just this simple concept seemed to be embarrassing Asuka somewhat, and even Shinji had to admit it was embarrassing as well. But, if Asuka was okay with it, then Shinji was too.

'啊，原来她是这个意思，' 真嗣心想。他们已经很久没有像这样互相取暖了。在那些睡在帐篷里的日子，自然而然地背靠背入睡，是为了保暖。虽然原理相同，但真嗣记不起他们何时曾直接并肩而坐，身体相依，被温暖的毯子包裹着。仅仅是这个简单的想法似乎就让明日香有些尴尬，连真嗣也不得不承认这确实令人尴尬。但是，如果明日香能接受，那么真嗣也愿意。

"Okay," nodded Shinji. "好的，" 真嗣点头道。

Sliding across the couch, Shinji placed himself directly next to Asuka, entirely aware of what she was still wearing. He could feel the smoothness of her thigh against his jeans, pressing against his leg. Several drops of water could still be seen clinging to the nape of her neck, and her hair held a certain sheen that was likely from the fragrant shampoo she had used. Against his will, Shinji could feel himself becoming aroused.

滑过沙发，真嗣直接坐在了明日香旁边，完全清楚她此刻的穿着。他能感受到她大腿的光滑透过牛仔裤贴在他的腿上。几滴水珠仍挂在她的后颈，她的头发因刚用的芳香洗发水而闪着光泽。尽管不愿，真嗣还是感到自己有了反应。

"What?" asked Asuka, noticing the uncomfortable expression on Shinji's face.

“什么？”明日香问道，注意到真嗣脸上的不适表情。

"Nothing," he hurriedly said, trying to ignore his growing problem. Asuka didn't have a clue about this, but just shook her head and muttered something.

“没什么，”他急忙说道，试图忽视自己愈发明显的问题。明日香对此一无所知，只是摇了摇头，低声嘀咕了些什么。

They sat like that for a while, not talking to one another. Each was embarrassed in their own mind, and Shinji more so, as he tried to suppress himself. This wasn't the first time he had felt like this towards Asuka, but he always felt ashamed whenever it happened. It was just a natural reaction that his body had, but he didn't like it, especially towards her. They were only friends afterall.

他们就这样坐了一会儿，彼此间没有交谈。每个人都在心里感到尴尬，而真嗣更是如此，他努力压抑着自己的情绪。这不是他第一次对明日香有这样的感觉，但每次发生时，他总是感到羞愧。这只是他身体的自然反应，但他并不喜欢，尤其是对她。毕竟，他们只是朋友。

Asuka meanwhile, had gotten her wish, as he body temperature had skyrocketed when Shinji sat beside her. She felt like she had a fever, even though she knew she didn't, and it wasn't just Shinji's body that was making her this warm; she understood that much. She was overly conscious about his presence beside her, and it was amazing how a matter of inches distance shift between them could make her feel like this. Asuka didn't know how long she could deal with this sudden heat.

与此同时，明日香如愿以偿，当真嗣坐在她旁边时，她的体温急剧上升。她感觉自己好像发烧了，尽管她知道自己没有，而且不仅仅是真嗣的身体让她感到如此温暖；她明白这一点。她过于在意他坐在她旁边，令人惊讶的是，他们之间仅仅几英寸的距离变化就能让她有这种感觉。明日香不知道自己能忍受这种突如其来的热度多久。

Simultaneously, the both looked at each and opened their mouths, intending to say something to the other. Upon seeing that they both had intended to say something, they again closed their mouths, and awkward feeling developing between them. Both were blushing slightly now.

同时，两人都看向对方并张开了嘴，打算对彼此说些什么。看到对方也有话要说，他们又闭上了嘴，一种尴尬的感觉在他们之间蔓延。两人现在都微微脸红了。

What was the relationship between them now? They had become so used to each others presence that they had very naturally just become used to normal interaction. This was different from their normal, everyday interactions however. A certain intimacy was being shared between them at this moment. Before, they had only done it to remain warm, but somewhere along the line, this notion had changed. When did they begin to just want to be like this together?

他们现在是什么关系呢？彼此的存在已变得如此习惯，自然而然地习惯了日常的互动。然而，这与他们平时的日常交流有所不同。此刻，某种亲密感在他们之间流转。起初，他们只是为了取暖，但不知不觉中，这种想法发生了变化。从何时起，他们开始仅仅想要这样在一起呢？

"Hey Asuka?" Shinji spoke suddenly, desiring to voice his opinion.

"嘿，明日香？" 真嗣突然开口，想要表达自己的想法。

"...What?" she uttered through half closed lips.

"...什么？" 她半闭着嘴唇发出声音。

"Whats are relationship?"

"我们的关系是什么？"

Asuka didn't reply, not wanting to speak about such a thing. Things were fine as they were afterall, and it wasn't like they needed to change.

明日香没有回答，不想谈论这样的事情。毕竟，现状已经很好了，他们并不需要改变什么。

'Do you honestly believe that?" came a voice in her mind. She ignored this however, not wanting to give a reason to listen to that part of her.

“你真的相信那一点吗？”一个声音在她脑海中响起。然而，她选择忽视这一点，不想给倾听内心那部分的理由。

Leaving the warmth of the blanket, and the feeling of being beside Shinji, Asuka didn't spare him another look, as she went upstairs.

离开毯子的温暖和与真嗣相伴的感觉，明日香没有再看他一眼，径直上楼去了。

After Asuka's footsteps faded away, Shinji felt a certain urge to lash out with his AT-field, but he suppressed it. Why had he asked such a thing, especially in that sort of situation? He wanted some answers, wondering what Asuka thought about their current living conditions. Maybe he was hasty in his assumption that she would be okay talking about this. Granted, he wasn't even sure he was either.

在明日香的脚步声消失后，真嗣感到一种用 AT 力场发泄的冲动，但他压制住了。他为什么要问那样的问题，尤其是在那种情况下？他渴望得到一些答案，想知道明日香对他们目前的居住条件有何看法。也许他过于急切地认为她会愿意谈论这个话题。当然，他也不确定自己是否真的准备好谈论这些。

The rest of the day slowly faded away, as they each spent their time apart from each other, Asuka upstairs in her room, and Shinji downstairs in the living room. At some point, as the darkness began to set slowly, Shinji decided that he should start preparing dinner. He wasn't in the mood to make anything special, so just settled on the first thing he saw. He called upstairs to Asuka only once, telling her that he was preparing dinner. She didn't reply, but Shinji knew that she at least heard him. Well, if she wanted to come down, she could.

随着时间的缓缓流逝，他们各自度过了分开的时间，明日香在楼上的房间里，而真嗣则在楼下的客厅中。夜幕渐渐降临之际，真嗣决定开始准备晚餐。他并无心情做任何特别的东西，于是便随手选了第一眼看到的食材。他只朝楼上喊了一次，告诉明日香他在准备晚餐。她没有回应，但真嗣知道她至少听到了。好吧，如果她想下楼来，她可以自己来。

Even after Shinji finished cooking, he didn't hear, or see any sign of Asuka, so he ate dinner by himself in the dining room. Without Asuka's presence, her voice, her occasional smile directed at him, the house felt very lonely and empty. Shinji found himself picking at his food rather absentmindedly, and his appetite began slipping away. Picking up his hardly touched dinner, he emptied the contents into the wastepaper basket. The leftovers were placed on the counter, covered in plastic wrap. If Asuka wished, she could come down later and eat.

即便真嗣完成了烹饪，他也没有听到或看到明日香有任何动静，于是他独自一人在餐厅吃了晚饭。没有了明日香的陪伴，她的声音，她偶尔对他展露的微笑，房子显得异常孤独和空旷。真嗣发现自己心不在焉地挑着食物，食欲逐渐消退。他拿起几乎未动的晚餐，将内容物倒进了废纸篓。剩下的食物被放在柜台上，用塑料薄膜覆盖。如果明日香愿意，她可以稍后下来吃。

Since it was now night, Shinji decided that it was about time he began practice. Knowing that Asuka wouldn't be joining him tonight, he walked to the front door without calling to her. Pausing at the front door, he glanced over at the Christmas tree, spotting the gift he had chosen for Asuka. Would things be like this tomorrow morning?

既然现在已是夜晚，真嗣决定是时候开始练习了。知道明日香今晚不会加入他，他径直走向前门，没有呼唤她。在门口停顿了一下，他瞥向圣诞树，发现了为明日香挑选的礼物。明天早上事情会变成这样吗？

Leaving the house, he stepped out into the white world. Snow had begun falling from the sky again, painting Shinji's vision white. Walking his usual path, he quickly found himself at the end of the corner, where he always practiced. Instead of stepping out into the middle of the street however, Shinji sat down on the edge of the sidewalk, and leaned back, looking up at the sky.

走出家门，他踏入了这片洁白的世界。雪花再次从天空中飘落，将真嗣的视野染成一片白色。沿着平日的小径前行，他很快便来到了常去的街角尽头，那是他惯常练习的地方。然而，真嗣并未走到街道中央，而是坐在人行道的边缘，向后倚靠，仰望着天空。

It was now about three months since he had woken up on the beach of Tokyo-3, and had met Asuka. How many things had they shared together since then, and how many things would they continue to share? What would they do once the winter season ended? Would they continue to live here, in Tokyo-2, or would they try to find another place? There was still two months left until they needed to make that decision, but Shinji was afraid that even when the time came, they wouldn't be ready.

如今，自从他在第三新东京市的沙滩上醒来并遇见明日香，已经过去了大约三个月。自那以后，他们共同经历了多少事情，又将继续分享多少呢？当冬季结束时，他们将何去何从？是继续住在第二新东京市，还是尝试寻找另一个地方？距离他们需要做出决定还有两个月，但真嗣担心，即使到了那时，他们可能仍未准备好。

Gathering up some snow that was beside him, he molded it into a snow ball, and flung it up in the air with all his might. As the compacted snow reached its maximum altitude, Shinji's AT-field ripped it apart, turning the snow to dust. He did this several more times, sometimes throwing two in the air at the same time. The feeling he got from the snow was entirely different compared to crushing that telephone pole.

他收集了一些身边的雪，捏成一个雪球，用尽全力将其抛向空中。当紧实的雪球达到最高点时，真嗣的 AT 力场将其撕裂，化为尘埃。他重复了几次，有时甚至同时抛出两个。与粉碎那根电线杆相比，他从雪中感受到的感觉完全不同。

At that moment, when it had been falling towards them, Shinji didn't have an instance where he thought he shouldn't use his AT-field. He had acted almost on extinct, when he had projected the dome over himself and Asuka. He had a nagging feeling that if had been only him there, it would haven't been a big deal. Even if the pole had collapsed on him, and crushed his torso, he probably would have just regenerated himself. With Asuka there, projecting the dome was the right decision.

那一刻，当它向他们坠落时，真嗣并没有一瞬间觉得他不应该使用 AT 力场。他几乎是本能地行动，当他在自己和明日香上方展开护盾时。他有种挥之不去的感觉，如果只有他一个人在那里，那根本不算什么大事。即使那根电线杆倒在他身上，压碎了他的躯干，他大概也能自我再生。但有明日香在场，展开护盾是正确的决定。

During these times when he was training, not once had he projected his AT-field based on his emotions. When he practiced, it almost felt like a chore, and so he didn't feel anything when he did this. It was different when the telephone pole had collapsed. He wanted to protect her, simple as that, and his feelings seemed to make it easier to control his AT-field. Even when he had crushed the pole, it was because he wanted to protect Asuka. If he had just cut the pole in half, without Asuka's well being in mind, that would have been simple destruction.

在这些训练时刻，他从未基于情感来投影他的 AT 力场。当他练习时，几乎感觉像是一项任务，所以他这样做时并没有什么感觉。当电线杆倒下时，情况就不同了。他想要保护她，就这么简单，而他的情感似乎让控制 AT 力场变得更容易。即使当他碾碎那根电线杆时，也是因为他想保护明日香。如果他只是简单地将电线杆一分为二，而不考虑明日香的安全，那纯粹就是破坏。

As he threw the last snow ball in the air, Shinji didn't project his AT-field, but let the snow ball fall back to the earth, where it broke apart as it collided with the ground. His hands were beginning to freeze now, but he did still need to actually practice.

当他将最后一个雪球抛向空中时，真嗣并未展开他的 AT 力场，而是任由雪球坠回地面，在与大地碰撞的瞬间碎裂开来。此刻，他的双手已开始感到冰冷，但他仍需实际练习。

With thoughts of Asuka in mind, Shinji began practicing. His focus wasn't as strong as it would have been if Asuka had been watching him, but Shinji did feel his AT-field was easier to control. Initially, he had thought that thinking about Asuka while he practiced would have been a distraction, but it looked like he was wrong. If his emotions helped control his AT-field, thinking about Asuka, as well as something positive was best. But then, the opposite could be said as true.

心中想着明日香，真嗣开始练习。如果明日香在场，他的专注力或许会更集中，但真嗣确实感觉到自己的 AT 力场更容易控制了。起初，他以为练习时想着明日香会是一种干扰，但看来他错了。如果他的情感有助于控制 AT 力场，那么想着明日香以及一些积极的事物是最好的。但反过来，这同样可能成立。

Anger was a real problem for Shinji now, and yet, he had no idea where it came from. It had to do with his other half, he assumed this much, but he couldn't fathom the reason. If he did let his anger control him, there was a possibility he could go out of control, destroying everything in sight. His emotions were a double-edged sword.

愤怒现在成了真嗣的一个大问题，然而，他并不知道这愤怒从何而来。他认为这与他的另一半有关，但他无法理解原因。如果他任由愤怒控制自己，就有可能失控，摧毁眼前的一切。他的情感是一把双刃剑。

Dissipating his AT-field, he let out a low sigh, and relaxed himself. In the weeks since he had discovered this ability, he had certainly come a long way until now, where he was actually able to use it properly. He still had difficulties here and there, but his control wasn't nearly as shaky as it had been.

他散去 AT 力场，低声叹息，放松了身体。自从发现这个能力以来，他已经走了很长一段路，现在他终于能够正确使用它了。虽然偶尔还会遇到困难，但他的控制力已经不像以前那样摇摆不定了。

Calling it quits for the night, Shinji began returning home. He wasn't sure what to expect when he got back, as he had hardly been gone half an hour.

决定今晚就此作罢，真嗣开始返回家中。他不确定回家后会遇到什么，因为他离开还不到半小时。

Walking up the driveway, he didn't spot a light from Asuka's window, and thought that she may have gone to bed early. He didn't think it likely though, considering that it wasn't very late in the first place.

走上车道时，他没有看到明日香窗户里的灯光，心想她可能已经提前睡了。不过他觉得这不太可能，毕竟时间并不算晚。

Opening the front door, he hung his jacket up, and spent a minute by the fire, warming his hands up, before he entered the kitchen. The plate Shinji had set aside for Asuka had been cleaned, and was now resting in the sink. So she had eaten at least.

打开前门，他挂起外套，在壁炉旁暖手片刻，然后走进厨房。他为明日香准备的那盘食物已经被清理干净，现在正放在水槽里。看来她至少是吃过了。

Taking this time to clean up, Shinji washed the dishes, and put everything away he had used for dinner. Rubbing the sleeve of his shirt against his brow in a tired like fashion, he looked around at his handiwork. This was good enough for tomorrow, as well as for when Asuka cooked dinner. Hopefully that was still happening though, Shinji thought.

趁着这个时间整理一下，真嗣洗了碗，把晚餐用过的东西都收拾好。他疲惫地用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头，环顾自己的劳动成果。这对明天来说已经足够好了，也包括当明日香做饭的时候。希望这还能发生，真嗣想。

Wanting to change into something more comfortable for the remaining hours of the day, Shinji began climbing the staircase to the second floor. The hallway was just as dark as usual, but Shinji's eyes quickly adjusted to the dim lighting. His door was slightly ajar, and dim moonlight was coming through the crack, hitting the opposite wall; against this wall, was Asuka. She was leaning against the wall, her legs drawn up towards her chest, and her arms wrapped around her legs. Half her face was dyed in moonlight, while the other was covered in shadows, creating a rather erie look. Shinji was surprised that he hadn't immediately noticed her.

想要换上更舒适的衣物度过剩下的时光，真嗣开始爬上通往二楼的楼梯。走廊一如既往地昏暗，但真嗣的眼睛很快就适应了这微弱的灯光。他的房门微微开着，一缕月光透过缝隙照在对面的墙上；靠着这面墙的，是明日香。她倚墙而坐，双腿蜷缩至胸前，双臂环抱着腿。半边脸沐浴在月光下，另一半则隐没在阴影中，营造出一种颇为诡异的氛围。真嗣惊讶自己竟然没有立刻注意到她。

Apparently, she heard his footsteps climbing the stairs, because she looked over at him. One of her eyes was reflecting moonlight, and the other could hardly been seen, even though they were both clear blue. Shinji found himself taken aback at this, and stared at her for several seconds, before she stood up.

显然，她听到了他上楼的脚步声，因为她朝他看了过来。她的一只眼睛映着月光，而另一只几乎看不见，尽管它们都是清澈的蓝色。这让真嗣有些惊讶，他盯着她看了好几秒，直到她站起身来。

"...Shinji." "...真嗣。"

"...What?" he replied, still standing near the stairs.

"...什么？" 他回答道，仍然站在楼梯旁。"

"I wanna...apologize, for how I acted earlier. I shouldn't have just disappeared upstairs without saying anything."

"我想...为之前的行为道歉。我不应该一声不吭就消失在楼上。"

"Well, I did say something unusual," said Shinji.

"嗯，我确实说了些不寻常的话，" 真嗣说道。

Asuka didn't reply to that, but simply stood in the moonlight across from Shinji's room. Assuming that it was okay for him to approach her, Shinji walked toward her. Their eyes met for a brief moment, before Shinji turned, and entered his room.

明日香没有回应，只是站在真嗣房间对面的月光下。真嗣以为可以接近她，便向她走去。两人的目光短暂交汇，随后真嗣转身，走进了自己的房间。

"How was your practice?" asked Asuka.

"练习怎么样？" 明日香问道。

"Fine. How was dinner?" “好吧。晚餐怎么样？”

"...Fine, and thank you for leaving something out for me."

“……还好，谢谢你给我留了些吃的。”

Shinji only nodded, as he began to pull off his shirt, changing into something else. He didn't hear anything from Asuka, so assumed that she must have turned the other way, or didn't mind that she was seeing his exposed back. As he began unbuttoning his pants however, he did hear a slight inhale, accompanied by the sound of shuffling feet. After he finished, he turned to see Asuka looking away from him. As he passed her to walk back downstairs, he saw her face was lightly tinged with pink. He chuckled briefly at that.

真嗣只是点点头，开始脱下衬衫，换上别的衣服。他没有听到明日香的声音，便以为她转过身去了，或者并不介意看到他裸露的背部。然而，当他开始解开裤子的扣子时，他确实听到了轻微的吸气声，伴随着脚步移动的声音。换好衣服后，他转身看到明日香正把目光移开。当他从她身边走过，下楼时，他注意到她的脸颊微微泛红。他为此轻声笑了一下。

"Where are you going?" asked Asuka, still standing beside his door.

“你要去哪儿？”明日香问道，依旧站在他的门旁。

"Downstairs," replied Shinji. "Unless, you had something else to talk about?"

"楼下，" 真嗣回答道，"除非，你还有其他事情要谈？"

Asuka bit her lips, unsure what she wanted right now.

明日香咬了咬嘴唇，不确定自己现在想要什么。

"I'm coming as well," she stated, following him.

"我也一起去，" 她声明道，跟着他。

Asuka was acting unusual Shinji thought, but then, he was still remembering what he had said earlier.

明日香的行为让真嗣觉得异常，但他仍在回想之前自己说过的话。

Asuka walked into the living room and sat down, while Shinji went into the kitchen and brewed two cups of tea. Returning to the living room, he handed a cup to Asuka, who accepted it graciously, and sat down on one side of the couch. The distance between them now was the complete opposite of what it had been earlier that day. Even the blanket they had been sharing was on the floor in front of the couch between them. All these things, just further reminded them of the moment they had shared.

明日香走进客厅坐下，而真嗣则走进厨房泡了两杯茶。回到客厅，他将一杯递给明日香，她优雅地接过，然后在沙发的一侧坐下。此刻他们之间的距离与今天早些时候完全相反。甚至连他们共享的毯子也掉在了沙发前的地板上。这一切，只是进一步提醒了他们曾共享的那一刻。

Setting his cup of tea on the ground, Shinji let out a small yawn, and sank deeper into the couch cushions.

真嗣把茶杯放在地上，打了个小哈欠，更深地陷进了沙发垫里。

"Tired?" asked Asuka. "累了吗？" 明日香问道。

"Must be, though I don't know why," said Shinji.

"可能是吧，虽然我不明白为什么，" 真嗣说。

"Maybe it's because of the way you used your AT-field today. Not to mention that you used it twice."

"也许是因为你今天使用 AT 力场的方式。更别提你还用了两次。"

"Maybe," shrugged Shinji, as he began to yawn again. "I don't know if I'm gonna be awake very much longer."

“也许吧，”真嗣耸了耸肩，又开始打哈欠，“我不知道自己还能清醒多久。”

Asuka glanced over at him, as Shinji yawned widely. She had done a good deal of thinking by herself earlier, after she had gone upstairs, and still didn't know what she wanted. She enjoyed things as they were now, but sometimes felt something different creeping up on them. It was gradually happening, and Asuka didn't think either of them had noticed it. What did she want? Did she want this change to progress?

明日香瞥了他一眼，真嗣正张大嘴巴打哈欠。她之前独自上楼后想了很多，但仍不确定自己想要什么。她喜欢现在这样，但有时又感觉有什么不同的东西在悄悄逼近。这种变化正在逐渐发生，而明日香觉得他们俩都没注意到。她到底想要什么？她希望这种改变继续下去吗？

"I think I'm actually going to turn in early," said Shinji, as he stood up. Walking into the kitchen, he poured the rest of his tea into the sink, and turned, but was surprised to see Asuka standing in front of him. He hadn't even heard her get up.

"“我想我真要早点睡了。”真嗣说着站起身来。走进厨房，他将剩下的茶倒进水槽，转身时却惊讶地发现明日香站在他面前。他甚至没听到她起床的声音。”

"Something wrong Asuka?" asked Shinji.

"“怎么了，明日香？”真嗣问道。”

"...No, nothing," said Asuka after several seconds of silence.

“……不，没什么。”几秒钟的沉默后，明日香说道。

"...Okay," mumbled Shinji as he walked past her.

"...好吧，" 真嗣咕哝着从她身边走过。

That wasn't right however, and Asuka knew this. But simply saying that outright, wasn't something which she thought she could do. It was embarrassing, and even more so, because of how she had acted earlier. However, if she masked it as something else, then that would be okay...probably. This wasn't exactly a first, but then again, in a sense, it was.

然而，那并不对，明日香知道这一点。但直接说出来，她觉得她做不到。这很尴尬，而且更尴尬的是，因为她之前的行为。不过，如果她用别的东西来掩饰，那就没问题了...大概。这并不是第一次，但从某种意义上说，这也是第一次。

As Shinji began ascending the stairs, Asuka turned to look at his back, and said, "Wait Shinji."

当真嗣开始上楼梯时，明日香转身看着他的背影，说道："等等，真嗣。"

Pausing in the midst of taking a step, Shinji looked behind him to see Asuka marching up the stairs after him.

在迈步的途中停下，真嗣回头看到明日香正快步上楼追赶他。

"Asuka, what is it? And you've been acting strange for a while now."

“明日香，怎么了？而且你最近的行为一直很奇怪。”

"I have not," retorted Asuka.

“我才没有，”明日香反驳道。

"What is it then?" "那是什么？"

"I-I've been cold these past nights so..."

"我-我最近几个晚上觉得冷，所以……"

Asuka broke off her sentence, her face turning steadily maroon. Why now did she have to feel embarrassed? She was just cold during the nights, so it wasn't like there was any meaning behind her words. But Shinji on the other hand-

明日香突然停下了话头，她的脸渐渐变成了深红色。为什么现在她会感到尴尬？她只是晚上觉得冷，所以这些话并没有什么特别的含义。但真嗣那边——

"Hmm...well, you do have a point," nodded Shinji.

“嗯……好吧，你说得有道理，”真嗣点头道。

"Eh?" stuttered Asuka, thinking that she had misheard him.

“哎？”明日香结巴了一下，以为自己听错了。

"Even I've noticed how cold its gotten, and this is coming from me who usually doesn't complain about the cold. You on the other hand..."

就连我也察觉到了这寒意有多重，要知道我可是向来不抱怨冷的。而你呢……

"Pardon me for not being a portable heating unit," complained Asuka. Shinji just smirked back at her and continued.

"请原谅我不是个便携式取暖器，"明日香抱怨道。真嗣只是对她咧嘴一笑，继续说道。

"I guess it would be warmer if we slept downstairs near the fireplace anyway."

"我想如果我们睡在楼下的壁炉旁，无论如何都会暖和些。"

"...Huh?" muttered Asuka.

"...啊？"明日香咕哝道。

"The living room is the warmest part of the house afterall, so it makes sense to sleep down there. I'll assume that you'll take the couch, and I'll have the floor, so-"

"毕竟客厅是家里最暖和的地方，睡在那儿很合理。我猜你会睡沙发，我就睡地板，这样——"

"Thats not what I meant at all you moron!" shouted Asuka, directly at him. Startled by her sudden shout, Shinji fell backwards, collapsing on the stairs, and accidentally brought Asuka down with him as his legs swung upwards in the air. His back was sore from the fall, but he was more aware of Asuka who was leaning against his chest now.

"我根本不是那个意思，你这个笨蛋！" 明日香直接对他大喊。被她突如其来的喊声吓到，真嗣向后跌倒，摔在楼梯上，不小心把明日香也带了下来，他的腿在空中乱摆。他的背因跌落而疼痛，但他更在意现在靠在他胸口的明日香。

"Why did you shout at me?"

"你为什么对我大喊？"

"Because you're an idiot!"

"因为你是个白痴！"

"I don't get you." "我真搞不懂你。"

"I didn't mean sleeping downstairs in the living room moron. I meant...like we used to...in the tent..."

"我不是说睡在客厅楼下那个笨蛋。我是说...像我们以前那样...在帐篷里..."

Asuka's voice became quieter as she reached the end of her sentence, and Shinji was barely able to understand the words she uttered. But he did, and when they registered, he felt his face turning red. He understood why Asuka had been so hesitant to ask about this now, and he also felt like an idiot for misinterpreting her words.

随着句子接近尾声，明日香的声音越来越小，真嗣几乎听不清她说了什么。但他确实听到了，当这些话在他脑海中回响时，他感到自己的脸颊发烫。他现在明白了明日香为何如此犹豫不决地提出这个问题，同时也觉得自己之前误解她的话真是愚蠢。

"Well...that is another option, I suppose," mumbled Shinji.

“嗯……我想，那也是个选择吧，”真嗣含糊地咕哝道。

"Forget I mentioned it," said Asuka as she began pushing herself off Shinji, but he held her back.

“忘了我提过这事吧。”明日香说着开始从真嗣身上起身，但他却拉住了她。

"What?" asked Asuka, her voice turning steely.

"什么？" 明日香的声音变得冷硬。

"No, its just that, I don't have a problem with it, so-"

"不，只是，我对此没意见，所以——"

Shinji found himself losing his voice, just as Asuka had.

真嗣发现自己像明日香一样，声音渐渐消失。

Staring back at him, Asuka finally said, "Fine...but you could you let me go first."

直视着他，明日香终于说道：“好吧……但你能不能先让我走。”

"Oh, right, sorry," said Shinji hurriedly.

“哦，对，对不起，”真嗣急忙说道。

After standing up, there was the other question in mind, and Shinji was the one to ask it.

站起来后，另一个问题浮现在脑海中，这次是真嗣开口问道。

"Umm...which bed then, should we decide on."

"嗯...那我们应该选哪张床呢。"

"Mine of course, since it's the larger of the two. I want to put as much distance between myself and you as I possibly can."

"当然是我的，因为它是两张中较大的那张。我想尽可能地远离你。"

'Doesn't that defeat the entire purpose of doing this then?' thought Shinji.

'那样做不就违背了做这件事的全部目的吗？' 真嗣心想。

Wordlessly, Shinji followed Asuka up to her room. If it had been his own room they were sleeping in, he probably wouldn't have felt so nervous. On the flip side, Asuka seemed more calm now. In her mind, this was no different than how it had been in the tent. Only now, they were in a house, with multiple bedrooms, sleeping in the same bed, and sharing the same covers. Other than those minor things, no difference.

无言地，真嗣跟着明日香上了她的房间。如果是在他自己的房间里过夜，他或许不会如此紧张。另一方面，明日香现在显得更为镇定。在她看来，这与在帐篷里的情形并无二致。只不过现在，他们身处一栋房子里，有多个卧室，同床共枕，共用一床被子。除了这些细微差别，别无不同。

Asuka climbed into the bed first, as it was hers, and moved to the farthest edge. Shinji stood there at the edge of Asuka's bed, aware that she had slept here every night for the past few weeks. As he battled with his more competent mind, he saw Asuka glaring at him as though saying, 'if you're not gonna get in, then leave already.' Against his better judgement, he climbed into Asuka's bed, staying on his side as well.

明日香先爬上了床，因为是她的床，她移到了最远的边缘。真嗣站在明日香的床边，意识到她已经在这里睡了几个星期。在他与自己更理智的头脑斗争时，他看到明日香瞪着他，仿佛在说，‘如果你不打算上来，那就离开吧。’尽管他知道这样做不妥，但还是爬上了明日香的床，同样保持在自己的一侧。

"Goodnight Shinji," said Asuka.

“晚安，真嗣。”明日香说道。

"...Yeah," Shinji heard himself reply, not sure who's mouth it had come from.

“...嗯，”碇真嗣听到自己回答，不确定这声音是从谁的嘴里发出来的。

Try as he might, Shinji found it impossible to fall asleep, and forced himself to not start tossing and turning. If he did that, Asuka would surely wake up and yell at him. Then again, he wasn't even sure whether she had fallen asleep yet. Surely she felt just as awkward about this as he did.

尽管他竭尽全力，真嗣发现自己无法入睡，强迫自己不要开始辗转反侧。如果他那样做，明日香肯定会醒来并对他大吼大叫。不过，他甚至不确定她是否已经睡着了。当然，她对此也一定感到和他一样尴尬。

Rolling onto his back, he glanced up at this foreign ceiling, which Asuka looked at every night. When did things evolve to this moment? When had the invisible line been stepped over? These thoughts raced through Shinji's head, until he couldn't take it anymore. Sitting up slowly, he glanced over at Asuka, but didn't see any sign of movement coming from her. Carefully, he left her bed, and tiptoed across the room.

他翻身仰躺，瞥了一眼这个陌生的天花板，那是明日香每晚都会看到的。事情何时发展到这一步的？那条看不见的线何时被跨越了？这些念头在真嗣脑海中疾驰，直到他再也忍受不了。他慢慢坐起身，瞥向明日香，但没看到她有任何动静。他小心翼翼地离开她的床，踮着脚穿过房间。

He stopped however, as he heard the shuffling of covers behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, he saw that Asuka had only shifted positions, and was now facing where he had once been. A part of him felt guilty for leaving like this, but another part of him felt relieved.

然而，他停了下来，因为他听到身后有被褥的窸窣声。回头一看，他发现明日香只是换了姿势，现在正面对着他刚才所在的位置。他的一部分感到内疚，就这样离开，但另一部分却感到松了一口气。

Opening the bedroom door, Shinji slowly walked out into the hallway, and entered his own bedroom, closing the door quietly behind himself.

推开卧室的门，真嗣缓缓走出走廊，进入了自己的房间，轻轻地关上了门。

Meanwhile, the moment Asuka's bedroom door had closed, she had opened her eyes, and looked over at the direction where Shinji had disappeared. He had left her, but she wasn't really surprised.

与此同时，当明日香的卧室门一关上，她就睁开了眼睛，朝真嗣消失的方向望去。他离开了她，但她并不感到意外。

"Coward," Asuka muttered, before she slowly drifted off.

"胆小鬼。" 明日香低声嘟囔着，随后缓缓陷入沉睡。

### Chapter 18: Attraction

Well Merry Christmas everyone, is the first thing I should say. I initially tried to post this in the morning, but error 503 was giving myself, as well as a lot of people troubles. Oh well, its the internet. Shit breaks. Anyways, I got a bit of rambling to do at the end of this, so I'll wait till then to talk.

好吧，祝大家圣诞快乐，这是我首先应该说的。我原本尝试在早上发布这篇文章，但 503 错误给我和其他许多人带来了麻烦。哎，这就是互联网。东西总会出问题。不管怎样，我在这篇文章末尾有些话要唠叨，所以我会等到那时再谈。

---

The 25th, Christmas morning dawned bright an early, without a cloud in the sky. Shinji had expected Asuka to wake him up immediately as soon as the sun rose, but that didn't seem to be the case. As Shinji sat awake in his bed, he had to admit that Asuka may not want to see him right now. She had been so excited when she had first discovered her present under the tree, but now, it seemed her enthusiasm had disappeared. Whether or no this was true, either way, Shinji had to get up and make breakfast.

12 月 25 日，圣诞节的早晨早早地明亮起来，天空万里无云。真嗣本以为明日香会在太阳刚升起时就立刻叫醒他，但似乎并非如此。当真嗣坐在床上清醒时，他不得不承认明日香现在可能不想见他。她最初在树下发现礼物时是那么兴奋，但现在，她的热情似乎消失了。无论这是否属实，无论如何，真嗣必须起床准备早餐。

Forcing himself to stand up, he changed clothes, and opened his bedroom door. He stopped, as he was about to go down the stairs, glancing over to Asuka's door which was firmly closed. He stood by his decision that he made last night. Whatever they had been stepping into, Shinji wasn't sure whether either of them were ready for something like that. Certain feelings weren't unusual in their situation, but then, their situation was anything but normal.

他强迫自己站起来，换了衣服，然后打开了卧室的门。就在他准备下楼时，他停了下来，目光扫向紧闭的明日香房门。他坚持昨晚的决定。无论他们踏入了什么，真嗣不确定他们中的任何一个是否准备好面对那样的局面。在这种情境下，某些情感并不罕见，但话说回来，他们的处境绝非寻常。

Sighing lightly, he walked downstairs, and began breakfast.

他轻轻叹了口气，走下楼，开始准备早餐。

While Shinji was doing this, Asuka's eyes opened in her own room, revealing the world around her. The sunlight from the above window, was beaming down onto her bedsheets, and reflecting off the silky surface, back into her eyes. Rubbing her remaining sleepiness away, she slowly sat up, and stretched.

与此同时，在真嗣忙碌之际，明日香在自己的房间里睁开了眼睛，映入眼帘的是周围的世界。从上方窗户射入的阳光，洒在她的床单上，又从光滑的表面反射回来，照进她的眼睛。她揉去残留的睡意，缓缓坐起身，伸了个懒腰。

It was Christmas, but to Asuka, it didn't feel like it was. No holiday lights, no freshly backed cookies, no greeters dressed as Saint Nicholas at malls; just herself and Shinji. She hadn't realized how badly she missed the feeling every year when Christmas was drawing closer. It was something she had taken for granted, and now she missed it.

圣诞节到了，但对明日香来说，这感觉并不像圣诞节。没有节日彩灯，没有新鲜出炉的饼干，没有商场里装扮成圣尼古拉斯的迎宾员；只有她和真嗣。她没有意识到每年圣诞节临近时，自己有多么怀念那种感觉。这是她曾经视为理所当然的，如今却无比怀念。

Throwing the covers off herself, she got out of bed, and started dressing down. She had already heard Shinji's door open earlier, so knew that he was downstairs getting breakfast started. Her present came to mind, but even that didn't make her feel any different. She was still excited to know what he had gotten her, but some of the anticipation had worn off.

她掀开被子，起床开始穿衣服。她已经听到真嗣的房门早些时候打开了，所以知道他正在楼下准备早餐。她想起了自己的礼物，但即便如此，她也没有感到有什么不同。她仍然很兴奋想知道他给她买了什么，但一些期待感已经消退了。

Pulling a shirt over her head, she turned back to her bed, and paused briefly, remembering last night. She couldn't explain why she had done what she did, but had already given up on wondering about it. In her mind, it was already in the past, even though it had just happened last night. Leaving this matter aside, Asuka turned away from her bed, and left her room.

她套上一件衬衫，转身回到床边，短暂地停顿了一下，想起了昨晚。她无法解释自己为何那样做，但已经放弃了对此的思考。在她心里，那已经是过去的事了，尽管昨晚才发生。放下这件事，明日香转身离开床铺，走出了房间。

Walking down the stairs, she could see Shinji in the kitchen, mixing something in a bowl.

她走下楼梯，可以看到真嗣在厨房里，正用碗搅拌着什么。

"Whats for breakfast?" asked Asuka, calling out to him. Seeming to be startled, Shinji almost dropped the mixing bowl, before he turned to her.

“早餐吃什么？”明日香朝他喊道。真嗣似乎被吓了一跳，差点把搅拌碗掉在地上，随后他转向她。

"Did I scare you?" said Asuka in a mocking tone.

"我吓到你了吗？" 明日香用嘲弄的语气说道。

Shinji didn't reply to this, but simply said, "Pancakes," before turning back to the counter.

真嗣没有回答这个问题，只是简单地说了一句，"煎饼，"然后转身回到柜台。

"I see," mumbled Asuka. She watched Shinji's back for several seconds, before she left and entered the living room. Sitting down on the couch, her gaze immediately turned to the Christmas tree she had decorated. It seemed like several months ago that she had done that. Beneath the tree, sitting on the carpet, was the strange gift that Shinji had gotten her. Ever since it had appeared under the tree, Asuka had shaken it every morning, trying to determine what it was. Seeing as this was Christmas, you'd think that the first thing she'd do, would be to attack the package, and tear it open to reveal its contents. She only gave it a passing glance.

"我明白了，"明日香咕哝着。她盯着真嗣的背影看了几秒钟，然后离开并走进客厅。坐在沙发上，她的目光立刻转向了她装饰的圣诞树。仿佛那是几个月前的事了。在树下，坐在地毯上的是真嗣送给她的那个奇怪的礼物。自从它出现在树下以来，明日香每天早上都会摇晃它，试图弄清楚里面是什么。既然今天是圣诞节，你可能会以为她会做的第一件事就是拆开包裹，揭开它的内容。但她只是匆匆瞥了一眼。

Curling herself up into a ball, Asuka let herself slowly fall onto the couch cushions. She didn't know why, but she felt miserable. It wasn't the events of last night, or even being unable to find Shinji a present; she just felt miserable. Ever since she had woken up on the beach of Tokyo-3, and found Shinji beside her, she hadn't thought much about the situation they were. They simply existed, without much purpose on this barren earth. If they were the only humans left, what then? What was the point of living even?

蜷缩成一团，明日香缓缓地让自己倒在沙发垫上。她不知道为什么，但就是感到痛苦。并非昨晚的事件，也不是找不到给真嗣的礼物；她就是觉得痛苦。自从在第三新东京市的沙滩上醒来，发现真嗣就在身边，她对他们的处境并没有多想。他们只是存在，在这片荒芜的大地上没有太多目的。如果他们是仅存的人类，那又如何？活着的意义何在？

"Asuka, I just took the first pancake off if you want it," said Shinji from the doorway.

“明日香，我刚煎好第一张饼，你要吗？”真嗣站在门口说道。

"I'm not hungry," mumbled Asuka, lying through her teeth. She was hungry, but she didn't want to eat anything right now.

“我不饿。”明日香咕哝着，撒了个谎。她其实饿了，但此刻她什么都不想吃。

"...Okay," said Shinji, not attempting to fight back.

“...好吧，”真嗣说道，没有试图反驳。

It was a short time later, when Asuka finally decided to get up. Instead up entering the kitchen and getting something to eat however, she walked to the front door, grabbed a jacket, and left. She needed to get her thoughts straight.

不久之后，明日香终于决定起身。然而，她并没有走进厨房找东西吃，而是走到前门，抓起一件外套，离开了。她需要理清思绪。

When Shinji heard the front door open, he began rushing towards it, but his footsteps quickly slowed until he was halfway between the door and the couch. Was it wise to go after Asuka right now? Shinji didn't know what he could say to her, that would make this whole situation better. In the end, he did nothing.

当真嗣听到前门打开的声音时，他开始急忙向门口跑去，但脚步很快就慢了下来，直到他停在门和沙发之间的一半位置。现在追上明日香明智吗？真嗣不知道自己能对她说些什么，能让整个情况好转。最终，他什么也没做。

After Asuka had hurriedly left the house, she ran down to the end of the road, glancing over her shoulder to make sure Shinji wasn't following her. When she was positive about this, she slowed to a stop, reaching the end of the street, breathing rather hard. She was standing at the sidewalk where she always watched Shinji practiced. But right now, she didn't want to think about his practice, his AT-field, or him in general. Only problem, is that was exactly what she need to think about.

明日香匆匆离开家后，一路跑到路的尽头，不时回头确认真嗣没有跟来。当她确信这一点后，她放慢脚步，停在街尾，呼吸急促。她站在她常看真嗣练习的人行道上。但此刻，她不想去想他的练习、他的 AT 力场，或是他这个人。唯一的问题是，这正是她需要思考的。

Unwillingly, she thought about what Shinji had asked her yesterday. What was their relationship? Friends? Companions? Two people stuck in a fucked up situation. All of those were technically true, but neither of them rightfully described their relationship as it was currently. Asuka felt like she was on a giant cliff beside Shinji, and that jumping off together would mean a drastic change in how they viewed each other.

不情愿地，她回想起昨天真嗣问她的问题。他们的关系是什么？朋友？伙伴？两个陷入糟糕境地的人。这些说法在技术上都对，但没有一个能准确描述他们当前的关系。明日香感觉自己像是站在真嗣身边的一个巨大悬崖边，一起跳下去意味着他们对彼此看法的剧变。

Asuka had known Shinji for almost three months now, three months in which she had laughed at him, hit him, tried to kill him, and eventually come to accept him as a friend. Those things, and many more, had all happened in these three months. Asuka had never thought that Shinji was somebody who could make her heart race like yesterday, but he had proved her wrong. Or maybe her own feelings had betrayed her.

明日香认识真嗣已经快三个月了，这三个月里她嘲笑过他，打过他，试图杀了他，最终却接受了他作为朋友。这些事，以及更多的事情，都在这三个月里发生了。明日香从未想过真嗣能让她像昨天那样心跳加速，但他证明了她错了。或许，是她自己的感情背叛了她。

In Asuka's life, she had never known what love was. True, she had a mother who loved her deeply, but she had very vague memories of that. After her mother had died, she had to learn to fend for herself in a household devoid of love. She had thrown away her emotions, and refused to cry anymore, because such things were useless to her. After she became an Evangelion pilot, those things had even further been sealed away inside of her, to the point where her entire existence was wrapped up in the concept of being the best pilot. Those physical object didn't exist in this After Impact world, and Asuka's emotions had steadily begun to resurface. Before she met Shinji, when was the last time she had laughed? When was the last time she had cried? When was the last time...she felt like this?

在明日香的生命中，她从未真正理解过何为爱。诚然，她有一位深爱她的母亲，但那些记忆已变得模糊不清。母亲去世后，她不得不在一个缺乏爱的家庭中学会自立。她抛弃了情感，拒绝再哭泣，因为这些对她而言毫无用处。成为 EVA 驾驶员后，这些情感更是被深埋心底，以至于她的整个存在都围绕着成为最优秀的驾驶员这一概念。在这个后冲击的世界里，那些物质不复存在，明日香的情感也逐渐开始复苏。在遇见真嗣之前，她上一次笑是什么时候？上一次哭又是什么时候？上一次...她有这样的感觉，又是什么时候？

These were all very unusual feelings for Asuka, and so, she wasn't sure what to make of them. They were pleasant, but also hurt her sometimes. When Shinji didn't tell her what was wrong with him, it hurt her, knowing that he didn't trust her with something of such importance. When something happened to him, he turned away from her, refusing to acknowledge it. Asuka didn't care about his AT-field, his physical strength, his regenerative abilities, or even his eyes which changed colors. She only cared about the Shinji she knew, the Shinji that she had come to know over the course of these three months.

对于明日香来说，这些都是非常不寻常的感觉，因此，她不确定该如何理解它们。它们令人愉快，但有时也会伤害她。当真嗣不告诉她他出了什么问题时，她感到受伤，知道他不愿意将如此重要的事情托付给她。每当他遇到什么事，他都会避开她，拒绝承认。明日香不在乎他的 AT 力场、他的体力、他的再生能力，甚至他那变色的眼睛。她只在乎她所认识的真嗣，那个在过去的这三个月里她逐渐了解的真嗣。

So the question was, did she like Shinji? Did Asuka love Shinji?

那么问题来了，她喜欢真嗣吗？明日香爱真嗣吗？

As Asuka walked down the long highway across from the streetlight, she had this thought, and had to stop. Love was maybe too strong a word for her, but like was...well, like as in what? A friend? That much was obvious, but something else. Strong affection towards, might be one way to characterize her feelings, but did affection make Asuka's face turn red like yesterday? Did affection make her hormones turn into a raging fire? Asuka was no expert in these things, but she didn't think so.

当明日香沿着长长的公路走过路灯时，她有了这个想法，不得不停下来。爱这个词对她来说可能太过强烈，但喜欢是……嗯，喜欢是什么意思呢？朋友？这一点很明显，但还有别的。强烈的情感倾向，可能是描述她感情的一种方式，但情感会让明日香的脸像昨天那样变红吗？情感会让她的荷尔蒙变成熊熊烈火吗？明日香对这些事情并不在行，但她不这么认为。

No, she was attracted to Shinji.

不，她被真嗣吸引了。

Still, even realizing that didn't do anything for Asuka's mental state. How had something like that happened? Shinji wasn't good looking, or manly in any way. He was a wimp, a pushover, and somebody that Asuka could never imagine being attracted to. Her emotions didn't lie however, so how did it happen? Was it really just because she had been around him for so long, or was it the little things that mattered? Waking up beside him when they had been living in the tent. Eating meals together, or sitting beside the fireplace together. When had she started to feel this way towards Shinji.

然而，即便意识到这一点，对明日香的心理状态并无任何改善。那样的事情是如何发生的呢？真嗣既不英俊，也没有男子气概。他是个懦夫，容易受人摆布，是明日香无法想象自己会喜欢的那种人。但她的情感不会撒谎，那么这一切是如何发生的呢？难道真的只是因为和他相处太久，还是那些微不足道的小事起了作用？在帐篷里醒来时他就在身边，一起用餐，或是并肩坐在篝火旁。她究竟是从何时开始对真嗣产生了这样的感情呢？

Asuka let out a low sigh, realizing that she had more or less, acknowledged her feelings. It didn't make her feel any better however. She knew that Shinji likely had similar feelings towards her, but that wasn't the problem. Both of them, and Asuka included herself as well, even though she would never admit it, were socially awkward. Shinji had grown up by himself, without anybody to talk to, friends and adults alike. Asuka on the other hand, had grown up considering herself superior to everybody around her, and in the process, ruled that friends were meaningless. Neither had experienced emotions like they were feeling currently, along with the added weight of hitting puberty.

明日香发出一声低沉的叹息，意识到自己或多或少已经承认了这份感情。然而，这并没有让她感觉好些。她知道真嗣很可能对她也有类似的情感，但这并非问题的关键。他们俩，包括她自己在内，尽管她绝不会承认，都是社交上的笨拙者。真嗣自幼独自成长，无人可谈心，无论是朋友还是成年人。而明日香则一直自视甚高，认为周围的人都低她一等，并因此断定朋友毫无意义。两人都未曾经历过如今这般复杂的情感，再加上青春期的额外压力。

Continuing to walk, Asuka determined that it was about time she head back. Shinji was no doubt beginning to worry, and Asuka knew what that felt like. Spinning around, she returned the way she came, creating two sets of footprints in the snow.

继续前行，明日香断定是时候该返回了。真嗣无疑已经开始担心，而明日香深知那种感受。她转身往回走，在雪地上留下了两串脚印。

When she came to their neighborhood, and rounded the street corner where the streetlight was, she spotted a familiar face sitting on the sidewalk. Shinji was sitting there, apparently waiting for Asuka to return. She smiled at this briefly, as she walked towards him. When Shinji spotted her, he stood up, and jogged over to her. Asuka didn't know how long Shinji had been sitting there, or even how long she had been gone, but she was glad to see him.

当她来到他们居住的街区，绕过街角那盏路灯时，她看到了一张熟悉的面孔坐在人行道上。真嗣坐在那里，显然是在等明日香回来。她短暂地笑了笑，朝他走去。真嗣一看到她，就站起身，小跑过来。明日香不知道真嗣在那里坐了多久，甚至不知道自己离开了多久，但她很高兴见到他。

"Hey," said Asuka as they got within speaking distance. Shinji didn't reply, but simple stood within arms length of her. Seeing this, Asuka's small smile fell slightly. Was Shinji angry with her because she suddenly walked off?

“嘿，”明日香在他们能说话的距离时说道。真嗣没有回答，只是站在离她一臂之遥的地方。看到这一幕，明日香微小的笑容稍稍消失了。真嗣是因为她突然离开而生气吗？

"Look, I'm sorry about just leaving without telling you, but I-" began Asuka, but Shinji interrupted her.

“听着，我很抱歉就这样不告而别，但是——”明日香刚开口，就被真嗣打断了。

Reaching out towards her, he grabbed onto both of her hands, and held them in his. Shinji's hands were slightly bigger than her own, so they fit perfectly together. Not being prepared for this however, Asuka immediately retorted back to him.

他伸出手去，紧紧握住她的双手，将它们握在自己的掌中。真嗣的手比她的略大一些，因此它们完美地契合在一起。然而，阿斯卡并未对此做好准备，她立刻反驳道。

"Wh-What are you doing you-"

“你、你在干什么你——”

"Your hands are cold Asuka," mumbled Shinji as he looked down at her hands clasped in his.

“你的手好冷，阿斯卡。”真嗣低声咕哝着，目光落在她被他紧握的双手上。

"Are they? I hardly even noticed," said Asuka. "Still, it isn't like it's far from our house anyway. I can warm them up near the fireplace."

"是吗？我几乎都没注意到，" 明日香说。"不过，反正离我们家也不远。我可以在壁炉旁把它们热一下。"

Shinji didn't say anything, but continued holding Asuka's hands, making the person in question begin to blush.

真嗣没有说话，但继续握着明日香的手，让当事人开始脸红。

"Say something already idiot!"

"说点什么啊，笨蛋！"

"...No, sorry," muttered Shinji, as he let go of her hands. Asuka wasn't pleased with this statement however. Even though he had been the one to let go of her hands, Asuka grabbed his right back. Her hands were cold, and his were certainly warmer, so it only made sense to do this.

“……不，抱歉。”真嗣咕哝着，松开了她的手。然而，明日香对这句话并不满意。尽管是他先放开了她的手，明日香立刻又抓住了他的右手。她的手冰凉，而他的显然更暖和，这么做再合理不过了。

"C'mon, we're going home," said Asuka as she passed Shinji, still holding onto his hand.

“快点，我们回家吧，”明日香说着，经过真嗣身边，依然紧紧握着他的手。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"Shut it!" “闭嘴！”

Asuka was fuming by the time they got home, and sat down on the couch, crossing her arms, making it look as though they'd never become untangled. Shinji had entered the kitchen, and was starting the grill again, preparing to use the remaining batter for Asuka's pancakes. After he was done, he brought a plate out for Asuka, with two pancakes on it. Asuka didn't say anything as Shinji handed her the food, but began wolfing it down. She had grown hungrier since her walk, and didn't care about appearances right now. Shinji cleaned up the kitchen in the meanwhile, waiting for her to be done.

到家时，明日香已经气得不行，一屁股坐在沙发上，双臂交叉，看起来仿佛永远都不会解开。真嗣走进厨房，重新点燃烤架，准备用剩下的面糊给明日香做煎饼。做好后，他端着两块煎饼的盘子给明日香。真嗣递给她食物时，明日香什么也没说，只是狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。她走了一路，肚子更饿了，现在根本顾不上形象。与此同时，真嗣收拾了厨房，等着她吃完。

When she was done though, Asuka walked into the kitchen, and dumped the plate in the sink, directly in front of Shinji. Turning around, her long hair spinning behind her, Asuka walked back into the living room, out of sight from Shinji. As he washed her dish, he could hear the shuffling of blankets coming from the other room. He was curious, but not enough to leave yet. He was giving Asuka time to cool off, though for what, he didn't know.

然而，当她完成这一切后，明日香走进厨房，将盘子扔进水槽，正好在真嗣面前。她转过身，长发在身后飘扬，明日香走回客厅，消失在真嗣的视线之外。当他清洗她的盘子时，能听到从另一个房间传来的毯子摩擦声。他感到好奇，但还不足以让他离开。他在给明日香时间冷静下来，尽管他并不知道是为了什么。

Several minutes later, Shinji walked out into the living room. Asuka was lying lengthways on the couch, a large blanket draped over her, the same one they had used yesterday. As Shinji continued staring at her, Asuka noticed his gaze from the doorway.

几分钟后，真嗣走进客厅。明日香正横躺在沙发上，一条大毯子盖在她身上，正是昨天他们用过的那条。真嗣继续凝视着她，明日香从门口注意到了他的目光。

"What?" she asked, her tone still harsh.

“什么？”她问道，语气依旧严厉。

"Did you have enough time to think?" asked Shinji, speaking for the first time in a while.

"你有没有足够的时间思考？" 真嗣问道，这是他好一阵子以来的第一次开口。

"Not your concern," said Asuka as she turned away from him. But it was his concern, considering it was relevant to him. Asuka wasn't about to tell Shinji this though.

"不关你的事，" 明日香说着转过身去。但考虑到这与他有关，这确实是他的事。不过，明日香可不打算告诉真嗣这一点。

Walking over to the couch, Shinji sat down, just as Asuka moved her feet out of the way. Grumbling about having to move, Asuka sat up, and glared over at Shinji.

真嗣走到沙发旁坐下，正好明日香把脚挪开。她咕哝着不得不移动的不满，坐起身来，瞪着真嗣。

"Are you angry at me for some reason?" asked Shinji.

“你是因为什么原因生我的气吗？” 真嗣问道。

"No," said Asuka. "不，"明日香说。

'I'm angry at myself damn it!' she thought.

'我真他妈生自己的气！'她心想。

"Should I not have left last night?" asked Shinji.

"昨晚我是不是不该离开？" 真嗣问道。

"Like I said I'm not-huh?"

"就像我说的，我不是——嗯？"

Returning her eyes to his, Asuka stared back at Shinji, confused by his sudden statement. That didn't bother her, at least, she didn't think it bothered her. She understood Shinji's reasoning behind why he hadn't stayed, but a part of her, did feel hurt by that. A small part of her felt like Shinji had rejected her in some way.

将目光重新投向他，明日香盯着真嗣，对他的突然表态感到困惑。这并没有困扰她，至少她不认为这困扰了她。她理解真嗣为什么没有留下，但她的内心深处，确实感到了一丝伤害。她觉得真嗣在某种程度上拒绝了她。

"Should I have stayed with you last night?" repeated Shinji.

"我昨晚应该留下来陪你吗？" 真嗣重复道。

"Whatever you did is your own decision, and it doesn't affect me," retorted Asuka.

“无论你做了什么，都是你自己的决定，与我无关，”明日香反驳道。

"You were the one that suggested it," Shinji reminded her.

“是你先提出来的，”真嗣提醒她。

"And you decided to go along with it, and then backed out at the last minute."

“而你决定跟随，却在最后一刻退缩了。”

"I know...I just didn't feel comfortable."

"我知道...我只是觉得不太自在。"

"Then how do you think I felt?" asked Asuka.

"那你认为我当时是什么感觉？" 明日香问道。"

"Why did you suggest that then?" asked Shinji.

“那你为什么那样提议？” 真嗣问道。

"I don't know damn it," swore Asuka, "I just..."

“我不知道，该死，” 明日香咒骂道，“我只是……”

Asuka bit her lips, and looked away from him. Her emotions were like a hurricane now, all jumbled up without any sense being made. What did she want afterall?

明日香咬着嘴唇，避开他的目光。她的情绪现在就像一场飓风，混乱不堪，毫无头绪。她到底想要什么呢？

Shinji let out a low sigh, and leaned his back against the armrest, sinking into the couch cushions as he closed eyes. He stretched his legs out as far as he dared go, with Asuka sitting on the other side of the couch. He was tired of all this bickering between them, and just wanted things to settle down for a while.

真嗣发出一声低沉的叹息，背靠在扶手上，陷进沙发垫里，闭上了眼睛。他尽可能地伸直双腿，而明日香坐在沙发的另一边。他厌倦了他们之间的争吵，只希望事情能暂时平静下来。

"What are you doing?" asked Asuka, confused by his sudden lack of interest.

“你在干什么？”明日香问道，对他的突然失去兴趣感到困惑。

Opening one eye, Shinji glanced across the couch at Asuka and said, "Resting."

真嗣睁开一只眼睛，瞥了一眼沙发对面的明日香，说道：“休息。”

"Resting?" spluttered Asuka. "What kind of a reply is that?"

"休息？" 明日香气愤地说，"这是什么回答？"

Shinji didn't bother replying, but closed his eyes again. Asuka wasn't prepared to end the conversation like this however. Sitting up straighter, she crawled across the couch towards Shinji, and grabbed him by the shoulders. Shaking his shoulders, Asuka tried to rouse him, wanting to continue talking to him, even if it was an insignificant conversation as this. Try as she might however, Shinji wouldn't acknowledge her, even when Asuka began pounding her fist against his chest. He didn't give any sign that he was paying attention to her, or that he was even listening. Eventually, Asuka gave up, and lay collapsed atop him, her heading resting against his chest. It was only then that Shinji spoke.

真嗣懒得回应，再次闭上了眼睛。但明日香并不打算就这样结束对话。她坐直了身子，爬过沙发靠近真嗣，抓住他的肩膀摇晃。明日香试图唤醒他，哪怕只是继续进行这样无关紧要的对话。然而，无论她怎么努力，真嗣都没有回应，即使明日香开始用拳头捶打他的胸膛。他没有表现出任何在注意她或是在听的样子。最终，明日香放弃了，瘫倒在他身上，头靠在他的胸前。直到这时，真嗣才开口说话。

"Are you done?" he asked.

“你好了吗？”他问道。

Looking up towards him, Asuka blinked several times, unaware of there close proximity.

抬头望向他，明日香眨了几次眼，未意识到彼此的距离如此之近。

"Yeah," she mumbled softly.

“嗯，”她轻声咕哝道。

"Are you going to get off me?" he asked.

“你打算从我身上下来吗？”他问道。

"...No," said Asuka, speaking softly again. "I'm tired, so just let me rest like this for a little while. I'm comfortable now."

“不，”明日香轻声说道，“我累了，就让我这样休息一会儿吧。我现在很舒服。”

While Shinji had been unresponsive this entire time, his cheeks did turn red as Asuka said this. How did he end up with such a stubborn and idiotic girl? Well, he was an idiot as well he supposed.

尽管真嗣一直毫无反应，但当明日香这么说时，他的脸颊确实泛起了红晕。他怎么会和这样一个固执又傻气的女孩在一起呢？嗯，他自己大概也是个傻瓜吧。

"Okay," said Shinji as he nodded softly, his chin nearly brushing the top of Asuka's head. After he said this, Asuka's hands which were still clenched into fists, unfurled themselves, and were now placed palm down on Shinji's chest. Asuka's head rose and fell with the rhythm of Shinji's breathing, and almost unconsciously, Asuka matched her breathing to his, so that they were in sync.

"好的，" 真嗣轻声点头说道，他的下巴几乎触到了明日香头顶。说完后，明日香紧握的拳头慢慢松开，手掌平放在真嗣的胸前。明日香的头随着真嗣的呼吸节奏起伏，几乎不自觉地，明日香调整了自己的呼吸与他同步。

"Hey Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"I can hear your heart..."

"我能听到你的心跳..."

As to a statement like that, Shinji didn't know what he could possibly reply with. Asuka was resting her head on his chest like it was usual. If somebody had told him this would happen a month ago, he would have laughed in their face.

对于这样的说法，真嗣不知道自己还能怎么回答。明日香像往常一样把头靠在他的胸前。如果一个月前有人告诉他这会发生，他肯定会当面嘲笑他们。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"What should we do after this?"

"这之后我们该做什么？"

"After this," replied Shinji. Immediately his face turned red, clearly misunderstanding Asuka's question.

"这之后，" 真嗣回答道。随即他的脸颊泛红，显然误解了明日香的问题。

"Yeah, after this winter season ends, and it becomes spring again. Should we continue to remain here in Tokyo-2, or find somewhere else to live. This house is nice and all, and it feels like our home now, but I feel something is missing. Maybe it's the city itself, but I think I wouldn't mind living someplace else."

"是啊，等这个冬天过去，春天再次来临的时候。我们是继续留在东京-2，还是找别的地方住。这房子挺好的，现在也感觉像我们的家了，但我总觉得少了点什么。或许是这座城市本身吧，但我觉得搬到别的地方住我也不介意。"

"Like where?" asked Shinji.

"比如哪里？" 真嗣问道。"

"Not in another city I think," said Asuka. "A small town maybe, though within driving distance of a city if we had to."

"我觉得不是另一个城市，" 明日香说。"可能是个小镇吧，不过要是需要的话，离城市开车不要太远就行。"

"I'm sure we could fine something like that, but there's still a long while before winter ends."

"我相信我们能找到类似的东西，但冬天结束还有很长一段时间。"

"Yeah, but its just a thought."

"是啊，但这只是一个想法。"

"I guess," nodded Shinji.

"我想也是，" 真嗣点头道。"

Asuka smiled at that, before sitting up, removing herself from Shinji's chest. Stretching, she glanced around the room. She was feeling better now than she was earlier that morning, and her eyes even fell on her gift under the tree. Shinji saw that she was eyeing it however.

明日香听到这话笑了，然后坐起身来，从真嗣的胸前离开。她伸了个懒腰，环顾房间。现在她感觉比今早好多了，甚至目光落在了树下的礼物上。真嗣注意到她在盯着它。

"How about you wait till after dinner now."

“不如你现在等到晚饭后吧。”

"Why? Shouldn't I open it now. Christmas is Christmas afterall."

“为什么？我现在不该打开它吗。毕竟圣诞节就是圣诞节。”

"Think of it as something to look forward to while you prepare dinner."

把它当作准备晚餐时值得期待的事情吧。

"Oh shit! Thats right!" said Asuka, forgetting about what she had promised.

“哦，该死！没错！”明日香说道，忘记了她曾许下的承诺。

Though it was barely even noon now, Asuka began making preparations for dinner. When Shinji asked her why she was starting so early, she just hissed at him, and told him to stop bothering her. It was apparent to Shinji that she wanted to put as much effort into this as possible, and she forbade him from even going near to the kitchen. So, he sat on the couch in the living room, continuing to read his book from yesterday, but found his attention was slipping. Setting his book down, he glanced towards the kitchen were Asuka was busying herself. He didn't know what she had in mind, but he would be lying if he said the anticipation was killing him. But bored was bored, and Shinji decided to take a walk outside.

尽管现在才刚刚中午，明日香已经开始为晚餐做准备了。当真嗣问她为何这么早开始时，她只是对他咆哮，让他别来烦她。真嗣明显感觉到她想尽可能地在这件事上投入精力，甚至禁止他靠近厨房。于是，他坐在客厅的沙发上，继续阅读昨天那本书，却发现自己的注意力不断溜走。放下书本，他朝明日香忙碌的厨房望去。他不知道她有什么打算，但如果他说自己不感到期待，那肯定是骗人的。然而无聊就是无聊，真嗣决定出去散个步。

Calling to her from the living room, Shinji said, "I'm gonna take a walk."

真嗣从客厅向她喊道：“我要出去散个步。”

Poking her head into the living room, Asuka was holding a spatula in one hand, and a pan in the other. Shinji grinned as he saw this, since it was very unlike Asuka to be having fun while cooking. Even when she did cook, she usually complained part of the time.

探头望向客厅，明日香一手拿着铲子，另一手则端着平底锅。看到这一幕，真嗣不禁咧嘴笑了，因为明日香在烹饪时显得如此开心实在罕见。即便她真的下厨，也常常会一边抱怨。

"Thats fine," said Asuka, after she scowled at him, wiping the grin off Shinji's face. "I won't be done for a while, and it's better for you to stay out of my way, incase you get the idea to take a peek in here."

"没关系，"明日香说道，她瞪了他一眼，让真嗣的笑容瞬间消失。"我还要忙一阵子，你最好别挡道，免得你动歪脑筋想偷看。"

Basically, Asuka was saying that she preferred Shinji out of the house while she was making preparations. She didn't want him getting any ideas.

基本上，明日香的意思是她希望真嗣在她做准备的时候待在外面。她不想让他产生任何想法。

"I wouldn't dream of it," said Shinji as he got up.

"我可没想过要这么做，" 真嗣说着站起身来。

Asuka followed his movements, until he reached the door, and stepped outside. Returning to the kitchen, she glanced down at her workstation. She had already made a bit of a mess, but that was easy enough to clean up once dinner was over.

明日香跟着他的动作，直到他走到门口，踏出门外。回到厨房，她低头看向自己的工作台。她已经弄得有点乱了，但晚餐结束后清理起来并不难。

"Alright, time to get started," said Asuka as she rolled up her sleeves.

"好了，该开始了，" 明日香说着卷起袖子。

While Asuka was starting to prepare dinner for that night, Shinji walked aimlessly through their neighborhood. He had walked these road so many times, that his feet just naturally carried him forward, without his brain having to thinking about where he was headed. He took a left at the corner where he usually practiced with his AT-field, and started treading the familiar path from that week ago when he had found Asuka's present. Instead of walking down that street however, he continued forward, until he reached another intersection. Taking a right, he passed by a stop sign, and what looked like a playground. He paused as he saw this, wondering when the last time he had seen a playground, or even been to one. His feet gravitated towards it however, and he quickly felt the rough surface of bark under his feet.

当明日香开始准备当晚的晚餐时，真嗣漫无目的地在他们居住的街区徘徊。他已经无数次走过这些道路，以至于双脚自然而然地向前迈进，无需大脑思考目的地。他在通常练习 AT 力场的街角左转，踏上了那条一周前发现明日香礼物的熟悉小径。然而，他没有沿着那条街走下去，而是继续前行，直到到达另一个十字路口。右转后，他经过了一个停车标志和一个看似游乐场的设施。他停下脚步，思索着上一次看到游乐场或甚至去过游乐场是什么时候。尽管如此，他的脚步还是不由自主地向那里走去，很快便感受到了脚下粗糙的树皮地面。

He had memories of playing on a playground when he was younger, but he had been alone then. Whenever the other kids parents arrived, Shinji was always left alone, since both his parents had left him. He remembered those times, and how lonely he had been.

他小时候在游乐场玩耍的记忆犹新，但那时他总是一个人。每当其他孩子的父母来接他们时，真嗣总是被留下，因为他的父母都离开了他。他记得那些时光，以及那种孤独感。

Passing the slide, and the jungle gym, he eventually found himself standing in front of the swing set. Gripping onto one of the swings, he sat down on it, and began to propel himself forward. How long it been since he did something like this? Not since he was seven probably he guessed. As he continued with the motions of propelling himself forward, he began to gather speed quickly, until he was high in the air. From here, he could see the tops of the surrounding houses, and feel the rush of air hitting his face. Reaching the maximum height, Shinji jumped off, throwing himself forward even more, surpassing the limits of a normal human body. If a child had seen him do something like that, they probably would have cheered, and then attempted to do the same thing. But Shinji was likely the only person who could do that.

穿过滑梯和攀爬架，他最终站在了秋千架前。紧紧抓住其中一个秋千，他坐了上去，开始向前推动自己。他已经有多久没有做过这样的事情了？大概从七岁以后就没再试过，他猜测。随着继续向前推动的动作，他很快加速，直到高高飞向空中。从这里，他能看到周围房屋的屋顶，感受到迎面而来的风。达到最高点时，真嗣跳了下来，身体更向前冲，超越了常人的极限。如果有孩子看到他这样做，可能会欢呼，然后尝试模仿。但真嗣很可能是唯一能做到这一点的人。

Slamming down onto the ground, Shinji thought that his knees would buckle from the sudden impact, but he stood up, straightening himself. Letting out a low sigh, he glanced over to the swing set he had just been on, and then sat back down on it. He didn't swing forward however, and simply gripped onto the chains holding the swing in place. A melancholy like feeling filled him, as he remembered other unpleasant things from his childhood. But, it was astounding where his life had taken him he had to admit.

重重地摔在地上，真嗣以为自己的膝盖会因这突如其来的冲击而屈服，但他站了起来，挺直了身子。他低声叹了口气，瞥了一眼刚刚还在上面的秋千架，然后又坐了回去。然而，他没有向前荡起，只是紧紧抓住固定秋千的链条。一种忧郁的感觉充斥着他，让他回想起童年时那些不愉快的事情。但不得不承认，他的生活走向令人惊叹。

He wondered, where he would be if he had never come to Tokyo-3 on his dads orders. Would he be dead? Would he be just one of the billions of nameless souls that had died because of Third Impact. Where would Asuka be? Would she be dead as well? Shinji couldn't help but feel that their lives were twisted and entwined together in some form. So if one of them had never set foot in Tokyo-3, how would their lives have changed? The possibilities were endless, but those were ultimately part of the past. The present was where they existed currently, but what would their future look like?

他不禁想，如果他没有按照父亲的命令来到东京-3，他会身在何处？他会死了吗？他会成为因第三次冲击而丧生的数十亿无名灵魂之一吗？明日香又会怎样？她也会死去吗？真嗣忍不住觉得他们的生活以某种形式交织在一起。如果他们中的任何一个从未踏足东京-3，他们的生活会有怎样的改变？可能性无穷无尽，但那些终究属于过去。现在才是他们存在的当下，但他们的未来会是什么样子呢？

They had made the decision to leave Tokyo-2 when the winter season ended, but even that seemed like a short term scenario. Shinji hadn't thought about it until then, but him and Asuka were together forever, until they died. Whether or not they desired this, it was forced upon them, as the apparent last humans alive on the earth. When they were in their forties, how would they look back on this time spent together? Would it seem all very ridiculous to them?

他们在冬季结束时决定离开东京-2，但即便如此，这似乎也只是一个短期计划。真嗣之前从未细想过，但他和明日香将永远在一起，直到生命的尽头。无论他们是否渴望这样，作为地球上显而易见的最后人类，这已成为他们的宿命。当他们步入不惑之年，回首这段共同度过的时光，是否会感到这一切都颇为荒诞呢？

Shinji began to slowly rock backwards and forwards as he thought about these things. Three months was a long time to spend in the constant company of somebody, and Shinji had a hard time thinking about what the next year would even entail.

真嗣开始慢慢地前后摇晃，思考着这些事情。三个月的时间与某人形影不离是很漫长的，真嗣很难想象接下来的一年会是什么样子。

Standing up, he walked away from the swing set, and then looked up at the sky. The sky was still clear, even though the snow still covered the ground, and Shinji was tempted to begin throwing snowballs in the air again like he had done yesterday. It hadn't been very long since he had left the house, and Asuka, but he didn't think enough time had passed.

他站起身，离开了秋千架，抬头望向天空。尽管地面上依然覆盖着积雪，天空却依旧晴朗，真嗣忍不住想像昨天那样再次向空中投掷雪球。他离开家和明日香并没有多久，但他觉得时间还不够长。

Leaving the playground, he stepped back onto the sidewalk, and continued walking further down the street. Again, he let his feet carry him wherever they pleased, but found his brain thinking about other things.

离开游乐场，他踏回人行道，继续沿着街道走下去。又一次，他任由双脚带他去往任何地方，却发现自己的思绪飘向了其他事情。

He had known Asuka for a longtime now, longer than anybody he had ever known before, unless you counted his father, and Shinji didn't. The feelings he got around her were hard to decipher, as he wasn't sure what he felt in the first place. Having never shared a bond with anybody before, Shinji wasn't sure what to think about this. He had to keep who he was in mind as well, the fact that he was anything but a normal human. Maybe he was afraid to take that next step because of this.

他认识明日香已经很久了，比他之前认识的任何人都久，除非算上他的父亲，但真嗣并不这么认为。他在她身边的感觉难以解读，因为他自己也不确定最初的感觉是什么。由于从未与任何人建立过联系，真嗣不知道该如何看待这一切。他还得牢记自己是谁，事实上他绝非一个普通人类。也许正是因为这个原因，他害怕迈出那一步。

The knowledge of his abnormality was a constant suppressive when it came towards his feelings for Asuka, and whether tangible or not, was something he kept in mind. Hurting her was the last thing he wanted to do, and because of what he saw, made him suppress his feelings even more. But they were true, his feelings for her, and he couldn't get passed that. His mind battled with itself, endlessly debating and weighing the outcomes of given scenarios. Everything came back to whether or not he could control his other self.

得知自己的异常状态时，他面对对明日香的感情总是感到压抑，无论这种感觉是否真实存在，他都铭记在心。伤害她是他最不愿做的事，正因为如此，他更加压抑自己的情感。但他的感情是真切的，他对她的情感，他无法忽视。他的内心不断自我斗争，无休止地辩论和权衡各种可能的结果。一切归根结底，都取决于他能否控制住另一个自己。

Quiet suddenly, Shinji stopped in the middle of the street. He had acquired this power by some means, and whether he wanted it or not, he didn't have a choice. But why did he have it in the first place? Assuming it was some experiment with Nerv, that had turned him into this otherworldly being, why had they done such a thing? Was the reason his father had asked him to come to Tokyo-3 this. But why him specifically? Why couldn't it have been somebody else? Why couldn't he have just lead a normal life.

突然间，真嗣在街道中央停下了脚步。他不知怎么地获得了这种力量，无论他是否愿意，他别无选择。但为什么他一开始就拥有它呢？假设这是 NERV 进行的某种实验，使他变成了这种超凡脱俗的存在，他们为什么要这么做？难道这就是他父亲让他来东京-3 的原因。但为什么偏偏是他？为什么不能是别人？为什么他不能过上正常的生活。

But would a normal life have led him to Asuka? Probably not, Shinji had to admit to himself. The concept of the AT-field wasn't anything new, as it had been something the Angels and Evangelions had easily used. All humans had an AT-field, the essence of who they were, or there soul, if you believe in such a thing. Having the ability to project his AT-field, was on par with the Angels and Evangelions, so did that make him like them?

但正常的生活会让他遇到明日香吗？真嗣不得不承认，这可能性不大。AT 力场的概念并不新鲜，因为天使和 EVA 都能轻易使用它。所有人类都有一个 AT 力场，这是他们的本质，或者说灵魂，如果你相信这种东西的话。能够投射自己的 AT 力场，与天使和 EVA 相当，这是否意味着他变得像他们一样？

A flash of orange erupted around Shinji, as he suddenly projected his AT-field upward, reaching for the heavens. He hated this power, this grotesque ability he had, along with the visions that accompanied it. But, without them, he may have never met Asuka. Without them, Shinji may have died when the building collapsed, and Asuka may have died if Shinji hadn't told her the vision he had had of her crash. He hated his power, but because of it, he had been able to prevent certain possibilities from happening. Whether he accepted himself, and learned to live with his abnormality, was ultimately his decision. As for his feelings of Asuka...

一抹橙色在真嗣周围爆发，他突然向上展开了自己的 AT 力场，伸向苍穹。他憎恨这种力量，这种伴随而来的怪异能力以及随之而来的幻象。但是，没有它们，他可能永远不会遇到明日香。没有它们，真嗣可能在建筑物倒塌时丧生，而明日香也可能在真嗣没有告诉她自己预见的她坠机幻象时死去。他憎恨自己的力量，但正因为有了它，他才能阻止某些可能性发生。无论他是否接受自己，学会与自己的异常共存，最终都是他自己的决定。至于他对明日香的感情……

Shinji dissipated his AT-field, letting his arms fall to his side. As for his feelings of Asuka...he hoped that they weren't one sided.

真嗣收起了他的 AT 力场，让双臂垂在身侧。至于他对明日香的感情……他希望那不是单方面的。

With that thought, he turned around, and started walking back. He had wasted enough time now, so whether or not Asuka was done with preparations, was her problem now. If she didn't want him in the house, she would just have to deal with it.

带着这个念头，他转过身，开始往回走。他已经浪费了足够多的时间，所以明日香是否完成了准备工作，现在是她的问题了。如果她不希望他在屋里，她就得自己解决。

Shinji hadn't actually realized how far he had walked, so when he finally returned to his neighborhood, it was with a gladdened heart. If nothing more, than to at least be able to see Asuka again.

真嗣其实并没有意识到自己走了多远，所以当他终于回到居住区时，心中充满了喜悦。即便没有别的，至少能再次见到明日香。

Walking through the door, Shinji hung up his coat, and then turned towards the kitchen. Considering Asuka hadn't come to greet him, Shinji assumed that she was still focusing on something in the kitchen. Knowing how angry she'd be if he walked in, Shinji resolved to simply call her instead.

走进门，真嗣挂起外套，然后转向厨房。考虑到明日香没有来迎接他，真嗣猜想她还在厨房里忙些什么。知道如果他走进去，她会有多生气，真嗣决定还是简单地叫她一声。

"I'm back," he announced.

“我回来了。”他宣布道。

A loud clatter sounded from the kitchen, as though something metallic had just fallen to the floor, after which was accompanied by a string of swear words.

厨房里传来一阵响亮的叮当声，仿佛有什么金属物品刚掉落在地，紧接着是一连串的咒骂声。

"Asuka, are you okay?" asked Shinji, still standing by the front door, and wondering if he shouldn't just go in and investigate. Asuka's next words banished that thought from his mind.

"Asuka，你还好吗？" 真嗣站在前门旁问道，心中犹豫是否该进去查看。但明日香接下来的话让他打消了这个念头。

"Don't you dare come in here or I'll smack you with this frying pan!" shouted Asuka, clearly flustered by Shinji's sudden reappearance.

"你敢进来试试，我就用这平底锅拍你！" 明日香大喊道，显然被真嗣的突然出现搞得有些慌乱。

"Glad to hear you're fine," said Shinji as he sat down on the couch.

"很高兴听到你没事，" 真嗣说着，在沙发上坐了下来。

"Quiet you!" "安静点你！"

"Alright, I got it," sighed Shinji. "You don't have to shout."

"好吧，我明白了，" 真嗣叹了口气。"你不必大喊大叫。"

"I'm not shouting!" said Asuka, doing the complete opposite of what she said.

"我没有大喊！" 明日香说道，完全违背了她所说的。

Shinji remained on the couch, waiting until Asuka felt like entering the living room. When she finally did, Shinji could see she was still flustered over his sudden appearance.

真嗣依旧坐在沙发上，等待着明日香愿意进入客厅。当她终于进来时，真嗣可以看出她仍然因为他的突然出现而感到慌乱。

"Sorry that I startled you," said Shinji.

“抱歉吓到你了。” 真嗣说道。

"You did not," grumbled Asuka as she crossed her arms.

“你才没有，”明日香嘟囔着，双臂交叉。

Asuka was standing by the couch, and looking down at Shinji. As Shinji glanced back at her however, he noticed some powdery white substance on her cheek. Standing up, he walked over to her, and because of this, Asuka got defensive.

明日香正站在沙发旁，低头看着真嗣。然而，当真嗣回望她时，他注意到她脸颊上有些粉状的白色物质。他站起身，走近她，这使得明日香变得戒备起来。

"What," she asked, just as Shinji raised his hand, and brushed one of his fingers against her cheek. Rubbing the white substance between his index finger, and thumb, he determined that it was flour, judging by the texture.

"什么，"她问道，就在这时，真嗣举起手，用手指轻触她的脸颊。他揉搓着食指和大拇指间的白色物质，通过质地判断出那是面粉。

"Something with flour," muttered to Shinji, more to himself than her.

"和面粉有关的东西，"他低声对真嗣说，更像是在自言自语。

He hadn't realized it, but when Shinji had done this simple action of brushing his finger against her cheek, Asuka's face had lit up like a Christmas light.

他没有意识到，但当真嗣做出这个简单的动作，用手指轻触她的脸颊时，明日香的脸就像圣诞彩灯一样亮了起来。

"Sh-Sh-Shinji!"

"Hmm?" he replied back, nonchalantly.

"嗯？" 他不以为意地回道。

He now saw Asuka's fuming red face, both from embarrassment and anger, staring back at his. Realizing his mistake, he began to open his mouth to apologize, but Asuka didn't want to hear about it.

他现在看到了明日香因尴尬和愤怒而涨红的脸，正瞪着他。意识到自己的错误，他开始张嘴想要道歉，但明日香并不想听。

"Jeez, just forget it idiot," groaned Asuka as she turned around.

"哎呀，算了，笨蛋，" 明日香转过身，抱怨道。

"Hold on, how much longer is it gonna take you to prepare dinner?"

"等等，你还要多久才能准备好晚饭？"

"As long as I damn well please," said Asuka, her voice growing in annoyance.

"只要我高兴，多久都行，" 明日香的声音带着不悦。

"...Sorry," mumbled Shinji.

"...对不起，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka remained turned away from him, with her arms crossed, and her face still bright red. Well, he had said he was sorry.

明日香依旧背对着他，双臂交叉，脸颊依旧通红。好吧，他确实道歉了。

"I'm actually done with preparations now," said Asuka rather quietly. Turning back around, she faced Shinji and continued, "So, dinner is more or less prepared now."

"我现在已经准备好了，" 明日香轻声说道。她转过身来，面对着真嗣继续说，"所以，晚餐差不多准备好了。"

"...I see," said Shinji. "...我明白了," 真嗣说道。

There were still several hours until then, unless they wanted to start now, when it wasn't even three in the afternoon yet. Not intending to do this however, Asuka walked passed Shinji, and sat down on the couch, stretching herself out.

距离那时还有几个小时，除非他们想现在就开始，而那时还不到下午三点。不过，并不打算这么做，明日香从真嗣身边走过，坐到了沙发上，舒展开身体。

"Ah, this feels good. I've been moving around so much these past two hours, that it feels nice to actually sit for a while."

"啊，这感觉真好。过去两个小时里我一直在动，能坐一会儿真是太舒服了。"

Shinji hesitated for maybe a fraction of a second, before he joined her, sitting beside her. As he sat down, Asuka glanced at him, remembering earlier when she had been resting on his chest. Her cheeks changed colors briefly, but she ignored this thought for now. Grabbing the blanket that was in the middle of the couch, she curled herself in it, and titled slightly, so that she was resting on the arm of the couch. She thought about tilting instead to her right, where Shinji was, but currently, she didn't know whether her heart could take another strain. It was already faster than normal, with Shinji sitting beside her.

真嗣犹豫了或许只有一瞬，随后便加入了她，坐在她身旁。他坐下时，明日香瞥了他一眼，想起之前靠在他胸口的情景。她的脸颊微微变色，但暂时抛开了这个念头。她抓起沙发中间的毯子，将自己裹了起来，然后微微倾斜身体，靠在沙发的扶手上。她考虑过向右倾斜，靠在真嗣那边，但眼下，她不确定自己的心是否能承受更多的压力。真嗣坐在旁边，她的心跳已经比平时快了许多。

"Hey Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"What?" “什么？”

"I was wondering, do you think about our future much?"

"我在想，你是不是经常考虑我们的未来？"

"Why must you include 'our' as though it signifies both of us."

"为什么你非得用'我们'这个词，好像它代表了我们两个人似的。"

"Doesn't it?" questioned Shinji, but Asuka didn't reply. She was only making a snide comment afterall, and knew that 'our' was the proper way to suggest such a thing.

"难道不是吗？" 真嗣反问道，但明日香没有回答。她只是在说风凉话罢了，而且她也知道用'我们'来暗示这种事情是恰当的。

"Not a whole lot, but by future, what exactly do you mean?"

“没多少，但你说的‘未来’具体指什么？”

"Like...how things will be in five, or even twenty years."

"比如...五年后，甚至二十年后会是什么样子。"

"Thats far too long a time to be thinking ahead towards. I prefer to think about this moment right now. Why?"

那时间太遥远了，我更倾向于关注此刻。为什么呢？

"I'm just curious how we'll look back when we're older, to moments like these I suppose. To us, twenty years from now, this will probably seem insignificant."

"我只是好奇，当我们年老时，会如何回顾像这样的时刻。我想，对我们来说，二十年后，这可能显得微不足道。"

"You think so?" wondered Asuka. She herself didn't think there was anything insignificant about moments like these, but she didn't say that. If anything, she felt that these moments were probably the most meaningful.

"你这么认为吗？" 明日香疑惑道。她自己并不觉得这样的时刻有什么微不足道，但她没有说出口。相反，她觉得这些时刻可能是最有意义的。

Sighing lightly, Asuka closed her eyes, much the same as Shinji had done earlier. It had been a longtime since she had worked this hard on something, so she felt like sleeping for a little while. Mentioning this to Shinji, he told her that he would wake her when it was time for dinner. Asuka could get a couple hours of sleep at least before then, and she intended on taking full advantage of that. Still, leaning against the armrest wasn't very comfortable.

轻轻叹了口气，明日香闭上了眼睛，和真嗣之前做的一样。她已经很久没有这么努力地做过一件事了，所以她感觉想小睡一会儿。她告诉真嗣这件事，他告诉她会在晚饭时间叫醒她。明日香至少可以睡上几个小时，她打算充分利用这段时间。不过，靠在扶手上并不舒服。

Sitting up, she glanced over at Shinji, and then motioned for him to move closer to her. Raising his eyebrows slightly, Shinji still did what Asuka asked of him, and next second, had the body of that girl pressed against his.

她坐起身，瞥了一眼真嗣，然后示意他靠近自己。真嗣微微挑眉，但还是照着明日香的要求做了，下一秒，那个女孩的身体就紧贴在了他的身上。

"Umm...Asuka?" “呃……明日香？”

"This is more comfortable for me, and you should be thankful that I'm the one that made dinner."

“这样我舒服些，而且你应该感谢是我做的晚饭。”

"Yeah but, I can't really move with you leaning against me."

"是啊，但你靠着我，我实在动不了。"

"Then don't," said Asuka simply, before she slowly fell asleep.

"那就别动，" 明日香简单地说道，随后慢慢进入了梦乡。"

Amazed that Asuka could be so easygoing about this, Shinji didn't have many options but to sit there calmly as Asuka slept against him. This had already happened once before, but for some reason, Shinji felt more aware of Asuka's presence beside him this time. Maybe it was because her presence was stronger, because he could feel her AT-field, but it was probably more than just that.

惊讶于明日香对此如此随和，真嗣别无选择，只能静静地坐在那里，让明日香靠在他身上睡觉。这种情况之前已经发生过一次，但不知为何，这次真嗣对明日香在他身边的存在感更加敏感。也许是因为她的存在感更强，因为他能感受到她的 AT 力场，但这可能不仅仅是那个原因。

Grabbing his book that he had placed off to the side, he continued reading, aware of the tired girl sleeping against him.

他拿起放在一旁的书，继续阅读，意识到疲惫的女孩正靠在他身上睡觉。

It was shortly after the sun had set, that Shinji roused Asuka. It took him several minutes to do this, because she didn't seem to want to wake up. Though Shinji suspected that she was awake after the first few times he gently shook her, and called her name, she refused to move. It was only after he placed the palm of his hand against her forehead, that she moved. Sitting upright, and clearly awake, Asuka glared back at Shinji, displeased about the manner in which he had gotten her attention.

太阳刚落山不久，真嗣叫醒了明日香。这花了他好几分钟，因为她似乎不想醒来。尽管真嗣怀疑她在第一次轻轻摇晃她并呼唤她的名字后就已经醒了，但她拒绝动弹。直到他将手掌放在她的额头上，她才动了。明日香坐直身子，显然已经醒了，不满地瞪着真嗣，对他引起她注意的方式感到不悦。

"It's time for dinner," Shinji stated.

"该吃晚饭了," 真嗣说道。

"I know," groaned Asuka, apparently not wanting to move from the couch. Though after Shinji stood up, and Asuka lost the pillow she was using, she was forced to move.

"我知道," 明日香咕哝着，显然不想从沙发上起来。但当真嗣站起来，明日香失去了她用来垫着的枕头后，她不得不起身。

Asuka entered the kitchen first, and told Shinji to stay in the living room. Shinji heard the backdoor open and close several times as Asuka walked back and forth from the kitchen to the grill outside. After a while of this, Asuka finally called Shinji into the dining room.

明日香率先走进厨房，吩咐真嗣留在客厅。真嗣听到后门几次开关的声音，那是明日香往返于厨房与屋外的烤架之间。如此过了一阵子，明日香终于叫真嗣进餐厅。

The plates and silverware were already laid out, and two candles were lit, placed in the middle of the table. Choosing his place to sit, Shinji looked around at the atmosphere, impressed by Asuka's dedication.

盘子和银器已经摆放妥当，桌上中央还点燃了两支蜡烛。选择座位坐下后，真嗣环顾四周的氛围，对明日香如此用心布置感到印象深刻。

Several more minutes went by, before Asuka entered the living room, carrying something in her hand. Placing it on the table in front of Shinji, he looked down at the tomato soup she had placed in front of him. Just at a quick glance, Shinji could tell that this wasn't one of their canned goods, so Asuka must have made it from scratch. It was maybe a little thicker than he expected, but he wasn't going to complain.

又过了几分钟，明日香才走进客厅，手里拿着什么东西。她把它放在新治面前的桌子上，他低头一看，是她放在他面前的一碗番茄汤。只一眼，新治就能看出这不是他们罐头里的那种，所以明日香一定是自己从头开始做的。也许比他预期的要浓一些，但他并不打算抱怨。

"Aren't you going to eat?" asked Shinji.

“你不吃吗？”新治问道。

"After I've served everything, I will," came her reply.

“我把所有的东西都端上来后，我再吃，”她回答道。

After Shinji was finished with his soup, Asuka then brought out two pots. The first contained entirely white rice, while the second contained some sort of sauce that was made to be eaten alongside the rice. Dolling some of this onto his plate, Shinji had just finished when Asuka brought out another pot, this one containing a mixture of vegetables. Shinji didn't think they had ever made so much food before, and hoped that Asuka had kept in mind that it was only them two when she was cooking.

在真嗣喝完汤后，明日香端出了两个锅。第一个锅里装满了白米饭，而第二个锅里则是某种搭配米饭食用的酱料。真嗣将一些酱料舀到自己的盘子里，刚准备开动，明日香又端出了另一个锅，里面是混合蔬菜。真嗣觉得他们以前从未做过这么多菜，希望明日香在烹饪时记得只有他们两个人。

The last dish that Asuka brought out, was the largest of the lot. She was carrying a giant pot, with mittens on either of her hands, and set it down in the middle of the table.

明日香端出的最后一道菜是其中最大的。她双手戴着隔热手套，捧着一个巨大的锅，稳稳地放在桌子中央。

"Is this everything?" asked Shinji, surprised by the amount of food.

"这是全部吗？" 真嗣惊讶于食物的数量。

"What, did you want more?" asked Asuka, misunderstanding his tone.

"怎么，你还想要更多吗？" 明日香问道，误解了他的语气。

"No...I'm just impressed that you could get all this ready."

"不……我只是惊讶你能准备好这一切。"

Asuka paused as he complimented her, but tried not to show how much she appreciated it. Removing the lid from the pot, a savory smell began to fill the dining room. It was a stew of sorts, although Shinji couldn't quite place the smell.

明日香在他称赞她时停顿了一下，但尽量不表现出她有多么感激。她从锅里取下盖子，一股香味开始弥漫在餐厅里。这是一锅炖菜，尽管真嗣无法准确辨认出这股味道。

"Its a German stew, though obviously without the meat. I toyed with the idea of adding the spam, but felt that it might detract from the whole thing."

“这是一道德国炖菜，虽然显然没有肉。我曾考虑过加入午餐肉，但觉得那可能会破坏整体风味。”

"It looks delicious," answered Shinji wholeheartedly. This time, Asuka did blush. As she returned to the kitchen however, Shinji called out to her, considering she had said that was everything.

“看起来很美味，”真嗣由衷地回答。这次，明日香确实脸红了。然而当她回到厨房时，真嗣向她喊道，考虑到她说过那是全部了。

"Wasn't that it? If you don't start now, everything is going to get cold."

“不是全部吗？如果你现在不开始，所有东西都要凉了。”

"One second," replied Asuka.

"等一下。" 明日香回答道。

From the kitchen, the sound of the side door opening could be heard, and before it had even closed, the sound of Asuka's feet returned was announced. When she came back into the dining room, she was holding something that Shinji had not expected to see again. It was a bottle of white wine, alcohol, in other words. The last time they had tried wine, neither of them had enjoyed it, so Shinji was surprised that Asuka would try this again.

从厨房传来侧门开启的声音，还未等门完全关闭，明日香脚步声的回归便已宣告。她回到餐厅时，手中拿着一样让真嗣意想不到的东西。那是一瓶白葡萄酒，换言之，酒精。上次他们尝试葡萄酒时，两人都不喜欢，因此真嗣对明日香再次尝试感到惊讶。

"I kept it outside in the snow to help chill it," explained Asuka.

"我把它放在外面的雪地里冰镇，" 明日香解释道。

"But last time we both hated it, so what makes this time any different?"

"但上次我们俩都不喜欢，这次有什么不同呢？"

"Honestly, it's more for the atmosphere than anything. This is Christmas afterall, so we should celebrate a bit."

"老实说，更多的是为了气氛。毕竟这是圣诞节，我们应该庆祝一下。"

While Shinji understood this, he still was unsure about actually trying alcohol again.

尽管真嗣明白这一点，但他仍然不确定是否真的要再次尝试酒精。

Asuka sat down across from Shinji, with the candles separating them, and started adding things to her plate. The dining table had never had so much food place upon it, and Shinji could almost hear the wood audibly groaning from the sudden weight.

明日香坐在真嗣对面，烛光将他们隔开，开始往自己的盘子里添加食物。餐桌从未摆放过如此多的食物，真嗣几乎能听到木头因突然增加的重量而发出的呻吟声。

Popping open the bottle of wine, Asuka raised her glass and took a small sip. Shinji thought that her reaction would be similar to before, but surprisingly, her face didn't turn sour.

明日香打开葡萄酒瓶，举起酒杯轻啜一口。真嗣以为她的反应会和之前一样，但出乎意料的是，她的脸上并没有露出厌恶的表情。

"Its not bad actually," said Asuka, as she glanced at the bottle. "Maybe the bottle I got before was just cheap. This bottle would have been twenty dollars, so I assumed something that expensive, probably wouldn't be cheap."

“其实还不错，”明日香瞥了一眼酒瓶说道，“可能我之前买的那瓶太便宜了。这瓶要二十美元，我想这么贵的东西，应该不会差。”

Taking the wine from Asuka, Shinji poured himself a glass as well, partaking in the wine. He had to admit, that it wasn't bad compared to the previous bottle, but he didn't think he could get used to the taste. Maybe he just didn't like alcohol.

真嗣从明日香手中接过酒，也给自己倒了一杯，一起品尝。他不得不承认，这比之前那瓶好多了，但他觉得自己可能习惯不了这味道。或许他只是不喜欢酒精吧。

They continued talking happily, as they ate and drank, passing the evening away slowly. Asuka had made just enough for them, that they could have seconds if they wanted, and Shinji wasn't hesitant to take seconds, making Asuka rather happy. She had put a lot of time and effort into this, and was glad that Shinji was enjoying himself.

他们继续愉快地交谈着，边吃边喝，悠闲地度过这个夜晚。明日香刚好做了足够的食物，如果他们愿意，可以再来一份，而真嗣毫不犹豫地要了第二份，这让明日香相当高兴。她在这顿饭上投入了大量的时间和精力，很高兴看到真嗣享受其中。

Slowly, the food around them began to disappear, until they had wiped their plates clean. Shinji hadn't felt this satisfied in a while. It wasn't like they had a lack of food, but neither did they cook anything extravagant, if this could be considered extravagant. Considering that Asuka had made all this as well, was just an added bonus in Shinji's opinion. Though admittedly, he would have liked to have seen Asuka in the process of making all this, but maybe that was the entire reason she hadn't wanted him there to watch her. It may have been too stressful her.

渐渐地，桌上的食物开始减少，直到他们把盘子吃得干干净净。真嗣已经很久没有感到如此满足了。虽然他们并不缺食物，但也没有做过什么特别奢侈的菜肴，如果这可以算作奢侈的话。考虑到这一切都是明日香亲手做的，对真嗣来说更是锦上添花。不过老实说，他倒是很想看看明日香做这些菜的过程，也许这就是她不希望他在旁边看的原因。那样可能会让她感到压力太大。

There was one thing that was bothering him however. The dinner hadn't consisted of anything flour based, and Shinji knew that it had been flour on Asuka's cheek. So what had she been doing with flour then?

然而，有一件事让他感到困惑。晚餐中并没有任何面粉类食物，而真嗣记得明日香脸颊上有面粉。那么她当时用面粉在做什么呢？

"Hey Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"Can you be quiet for a while. I'm too relaxed."

"你能安静一会儿吗？我太放松了。"

"You haven't had too much wine, have you?"

"你没喝太多酒吧？"

"No, I'm sober. But, I think I forgot what dinner was really like. What did you want?"

"没有，我很清醒。不过，我想我忘了晚餐到底是什么样的了。你想要什么？"

"I was just wondering, about the flour, why there was some on your cheek?"

"我只是有点好奇，关于面粉，为什么你脸颊上有一些？"

Groaning slightly, Asuka said, "Did you really have to bring that up?"

稍微叹了口气，明日香说：“你真的有必要提这个吗？”

"Why?" "为什么？"

Asuka frowned slightly, wondering whether she should just show Shinji. She had made a failed attempt at something, and wasn't very pleased with the outcome. It wasn't for lack of experience, but more of the proper ingredients. Still, she had tried, but it hadn't turned out like she hoped.

明日香微微皱眉，犹豫是否应该直接给真嗣看。她尝试做某样东西失败了，对结果并不满意。这并非缺乏经验，而是缺少合适的材料。尽管如此，她还是尝试了，但结果并未如她所愿。

"Fine. If you want to see, I'll show you I guess."

好吧。如果你真想看，我就给你看看吧。

Standing up, Asuka led Shinji into the kitchen. Shinji knew that it was probably messy in there, but his expectations were blown away. Asuka had kept the place fairly tidy, and while their were several cans off to the side, and several bowls which obviously needing washing, the counter itself wasn't bad. Looking down at the floor however, Shinji noticed that there was flour on the floor for some reason. Glancing questioningly over at Asuka, she simply let out a sigh.

站起身来，明日香领着真嗣走进厨房。真嗣知道那里可能很乱，但实际情况却让他大吃一惊。明日香把地方保持得相当整洁，尽管有几个罐子放在一旁，还有几个明显需要清洗的碗，但台面本身并不糟糕。然而，低头看向地板时，真嗣注意到不知为何地上有面粉。他疑惑地瞥向明日香，她只是叹了口气。

"Though it may sound stupid, I tried making chocolate chip cookies, though the end result wasn't desirable. When you returned to the house, I was trying to decide how to overcome the lack of eggs and butter, and thats when you called out to me; I knocked over a mixing bowl that had flour in it. Course, I clean most of it up, but there's still some left on the floor."

虽然听起来可能很傻，我尝试做了巧克力碎片饼干，但最终结果并不理想。当你回到房子时，我正努力想办法克服缺少鸡蛋和黄油的困境，就在那时你喊了我一声；我不小心打翻了一个装着面粉的搅拌碗。当然，我清理了大部分，但地板上还残留了一些。

"So that explains the spot of flour on your cheek."

"原来你脸上的面粉是这么来的。"

"Like a said, it was stupid. I eventually just gave up, and threw the lot of it away."

"就像我说的，这太蠢了。最后我放弃了，把它们全扔了。"

"Well, it was an interesting and thoughtful idea, not to mention I can't imagine you making cookies," said Shinji.

""嗯，这是个有趣又贴心的主意，更别说我真想象不出你做饼干的模样。" 真嗣说道。

"Whats that supposed to mean?" Asuka fired back at him, but she was more embarrassed then anything. "Anyway," she continued, "I suppose I should start cleaning up."

"那是什么意思？" 明日香回敬他，但她更多的是感到尴尬。"不管怎样，"她继续说，"我想我应该开始收拾了。"

"Okay, I'll help." "好的，我来帮忙。"

"I'm the one that made dinner, and this mess, so I'll deal with the aftermath."

"晚餐是我做的，这乱摊子也是我搞的，所以后果我来处理。"

"You help me clean up sometimes," Shinji reminded her.

"你有时会帮我打扫，" 真嗣提醒她。

"...Fine. Go get the dishes from the dining room and bring them over."

"……好吧。去餐厅把盘子拿过来。"

Shinji did as Asuka told him. It was a different feeling, being told what to do by Asuka in this scenario. Usually, it was him that asked her to get this and that for him, as he washed the dishes. Asuka seemed to be enjoying herself however as she bossed Shinji around.

真嗣照着明日香说的做了。这种被明日香指挥的感觉很不一样。通常是他让她帮他拿这个拿那个，而他洗盘子。不过明日香似乎很享受，她指挥真嗣的样子。

As the dishes were almost done, Shinji let Asuka finish the last few, and walked into the living room, sitting down on the couch. It had been a tumultuous kind of day, and Shinji had enjoyed himself. But, there was something still left to take care of.

当菜肴即将完成时，真嗣让明日香完成最后几道，自己则走进客厅，坐在沙发上。这一天充满了波折，真嗣感到很愉快。但，还有些事情需要处理。

Asuka seemed to have a similar idea, because after she was done in the kitchen, she rushed into the living room, and sat down on the couch beside Shinji. She didn't look at him, but was staring at her present still under the Christmas tree. Shinji thought that she had forgotten about it, what with the excitement of diner, and the actual preparation of it, but it seemed he was wrong. Glancing over at Asuka, he saw that she was smiling slightly. Well, that was to be expected he supposed.

明日香似乎也有同样的想法，因为她完成厨房的工作后，急忙冲进客厅，坐在真嗣旁边的沙发上。她没有看他，而是盯着圣诞树下她的礼物。真嗣以为她已经忘记了，毕竟晚餐的兴奋和实际准备让它显得不那么重要，但他似乎错了。瞥了一眼明日香，他看到她微微地笑着。嗯，这也在情理之中。

"You can open it you know," Shinji told her.

“你可以打开它的，你知道。”真嗣告诉她。

"I know," she replied. "But, I feel nervous for some reason."

“我知道，”她回答，“但不知为何，我感到有些紧张。”

"How could you feel nervous?"

"你怎么会感到紧张呢？"

"Because you got it for me of course," said Asuka.

"当然是因为你为我准备的啊，" 明日香说道。

Shinji's ears turned red at her statement, but he simply said, "Just open it already."

真嗣听到她的话，耳朵变红了，但他只是说："快打开吧。"

Asuka didn't need to be told twice. Springing off the couch, she landed beside the tree, and grabbed the package out from underneath it. She stared at it for several seconds, looking at her own name, messily written on the wrapping paper. Shinji's handwriting was terrible, but she felt like that was almost assumed. Tearing through the wrapping paper, her mind ran through multiple objects that existed in this world that had a similar shape, but couldn't match anything with the object in her hand that she thought Shinji would get her. As she pulled the last of the wrapping paper off, she stared at the rectangular box held in her hand.

明日香不需要别人说第二遍。她从沙发上一跃而起，落在树旁，伸手从树下抓出包裹。她盯着它看了好几秒，看着自己潦草的名字写在包装纸上。真嗣的字迹糟糕透顶，但她觉得这几乎是预料之中的事。她撕开包装纸，脑海中闪过多种可能的形状，却无法将手中的物体与任何她认为真嗣会送给她的东西匹配。当她扯下最后一片包装纸时，她凝视着手中握着的矩形盒子。

"Its inside of that," said Shinji from the couch. "If I had wrapped it as it was, it would have been too obvious."

“里面才是，”真嗣从沙发上说道，“如果我直接那样包装，就太明显了。”

Asuka hardly paid him any attention, as she tugged at the corner of the cardboard, attempting to rip it off. Shinji almost expected her to start biting at it, but she eventually did open it. Inside, was several crumpled bits of wrapping paper, failed attempts by Shinji of wrapping it initially. Pulling these out of the way, Asuka looked inside the box, spotting a small object resting in the far back corner. Turning the box upside down, the object fell out into the palm of her hand. It was a grey, square box, with a hinge on its side, and presumably, something inside of it. Knowing the sort of object that was likely inside, Asuka could only turn towards Shinji with a questioning look in her eyes. Shinji didn't say anything, but simply nodded back at her, and Asuka slowly opened the box.

明日香几乎没怎么理会他，只是用力拽着纸箱的一角，试图将其撕开。真嗣差点以为她会开始咬它，但她最终还是打开了。里面是几张皱巴巴的包装纸，是真嗣最初尝试包装时的失败之作。拨开这些纸，明日香朝箱子里看去，发现一个不起眼的小物件静静躺在最里面的角落。她将箱子倒置，那物件便落入她的掌心。这是一个灰色的方形小盒，侧面有铰链，里面想必装着什么。知道这大概是什么东西后，明日香只能转头看向真嗣，眼中带着询问的神色。真嗣没有说话，只是向她点了点头，明日香便缓缓打开了盒子。

A silver chained necklace rested on white velvet inside the box, and in the center of the necklace, was a blue gemstone, the color of ocean blue. Picking it up, Asuka held the necklace at her eye level, to get a better look at it. It had a certain shine to, like that you see of the sun reflecting off the ocean surface in the evening.

一条银链项链静静地躺在盒子内的白色天鹅绒上，项链中央镶嵌着一颗湛蓝色的宝石，宛如海洋般深邃。明日香拿起项链，将其举至与视线平齐，以便更仔细地端详。它散发着一种独特的光泽，仿佛傍晚时分阳光在海面上反射出的光芒。

"...Shinji..." mumbled Asuka, incredibly quiet.

"...真嗣..." 明日香喃喃道，声音出奇地轻。

"When I saw that gem in the center, it reminded me of your own eyes, so I decided to get it. Like I said, it was a feeling that I just got."

"当我看到那颗位于中心的宝石，它让我想起了你的眼睛，所以我决定买下它。就像我说的，那是一种突如其来的感觉。"

At his words, Asuka's head wiped around to face him. Her face was passive, so Shinji couldn't tell what her reaction was. He hoped that she wasn't angry at him, for getting her a necklace. It wasn't something that was necessarily useful, but all the same, Shinji was rather proud with himself for finding something like that. He sometimes thought about what would have happened if he hadn't decided to enter that house after his vision.

听到他的话，明日香猛地转过头来面对他。她的表情平静，让真嗣无法判断她的反应。他希望她没有因为他买了一条项链而生气。这并不是一件必需品，但尽管如此，真嗣对自己能找到这样的东西感到相当自豪。他有时会想，如果他没有在那个预感后决定进入那栋房子，会发生什么。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji. "Do you like it?"

"明日香？" 真嗣问道。"你喜欢吗？"

Again, Asuka didn't reply to him, but just kept staring at him. Shinji was starting to get worried that she was in fact angry with him, and began to open his mouth to say something, when Asuka slowly began walking over to him. As she did this, Shinji thought he saw a small smile pass over Asuka's face, before she fell into his arms. Shinji hardly had any time to prepare himself as Asuka did this, but next second, her entire body's weight was being pressed against him, and her arms were enveloped around his back. Being as he was still sitting on the couch, this was a rather awkward position.

又一次，明日香没有回应他，只是继续盯着他看。真嗣开始担心她实际上是在生他的气，正要张嘴说些什么，这时明日香缓缓向他走来。在她这样做的时候，真嗣觉得他看到明日香脸上掠过一丝微笑，然后她扑进了他的怀里。真嗣几乎没有时间准备，下一秒，她的整个身体的重量都压在了他身上，她的手臂环绕在他的背上。由于他仍然坐在沙发上，这个姿势相当尴尬。

"Asuka-" “明日香——”

"Thank you," whispered Asuka, directly into his ear. Her head was resting on his shoulder, so she only had to turn slightly to say this to him.

“谢谢你，”明日香对着他的耳朵低声说道。她的头靠在他的肩膀上，所以她只需稍微转头就能对他说这句话。

"Thank you," she whispered again.

“谢谢你。”她再次低语道。

Never before had Shinji been so aware of Asuka's presence as he was then. The warmth of her body being pressed against his, her legs intertwined with his, the feel of her hands on his back. All these things stimulated Shinji to an extent where he wasn't sure whether he could control himself. Whether Asuka noticed any of this, she didn't say, as she continued hugging him.

从未有过一刻，真嗣如此强烈地感受到明日香的存在。她的体温紧贴着他，双腿交缠，双手在他背上的触感。这一切让真嗣激动到几乎无法自控的地步。明日香是否察觉到了这些，她没有说，只是继续拥抱着他。

"I don't think I've ever received something so beautiful," mumbled Asuka with a low sigh.

“我从没收到过这么美的东西。”明日香低声叹息道。

"...I'm glad you like it," said Shinji, finding his voice. Asuka's breath was tickling his ear, and whether she was doing this on purpose or not, Shinji wasn't sure how much more he could take of this. Asuka leaned back from him however at this point, but was still pressing her body against his, as she looked up at him. Even her face was pink, as she glanced up at Shinji, their faces only inches apart. Shinji didn't know what was about to happen, or if it would happen, but-

"...我很高兴你喜欢，" 真嗣终于找回了自己的声音。明日香的呼吸轻拂着他的耳畔，她是否故意如此，真嗣不得而知，但他不确定自己还能承受多久。然而此时，明日香从他身上退开，却依然紧贴着他的身体，抬头望着他。她的脸颊泛着粉红，目光闪烁地看向真嗣，两人的脸庞仅相隔几英寸。真嗣不知道接下来会发生什么，或者是否会发生，但——

Quiet suddenly, he felt the warmth from Asuka disappear, as she moved off him. She was now standing in front of him, with her hand outstretched, offering it to him. Confused by this, Shinji took Asuka's hands, and was pulled to his feet.

突然间，他感到明日香身上的温暖消失了，她从他身上移开。现在她站在他面前，伸出手，向他递出。真嗣对此感到困惑，握住了明日香的手，被她拉起身来。

"Here, clasp it for me," said Asuka.

"来，帮我扣上，" 明日香说道。

So this is what she wanted, realized Shinji. Taking the necklace from her, Shinji glanced down at it, not imagining that he would be doing something like this when he first found it. Parting her hair, Asuka gave Shinji a clear few of the nape of her neck. Trying not to think too much about her smooth skin, Shinji brought his arms around on either side of her, and held the necklace up against her neck, being careful to not bump into anything. With her hair still parted, Shinji was easily able to hook the chain together, and then let go of it.

原来这就是她想要的，真嗣恍然大悟。他从她手中接过项链，低头看着它，没想到自己会做这样的事情。绫波让真嗣清楚地看到了她后颈的肌肤，她分开了头发。真嗣尽量不去想她光滑的皮肤，双臂环绕在她两侧，将项链轻轻地放在她的脖子上，小心翼翼地避免碰到任何东西。头发依旧分开着，真嗣轻松地将链条扣在一起，然后松开了手。

"How does it look?" asked Asuka as she turned around to face him.

“看起来怎么样？”绫波转过身来面对着他问道。

The stone glimmered even in the dark, or maybe that was the fireplace reflected off it. Either way, it had the same shine as Asuka's eyes did sometimes.

即使在黑暗中，宝石也闪闪发光，或许是壁炉的火光反射在上面。无论如何，它和绫波的眼睛有时一样闪亮。

"It looks good," said Shinji.

"看起来不错," 真嗣说。

"Is that all you can say?" sighed Asuka.

"你就只能说这个吗？" 明日香叹气道。

Shinji didn't reply, but simply smirked at her, and Asuka returned that in a like manner. Again though, she approached him, and hugged him. Shinji wasn't as surprised by this as he was the previous time, and therefore wasn't as embarrassed. Likewise, he brought his arms around her back, and hugged her as well. They shared this moment together, hugging in the middle of their living room, with the light of the fireplace illuminating them.

真嗣没有回答，只是对她微微一笑，明日香也以同样的方式回应。然而，她再次走向他，拥抱了他。这一次，真嗣没有像上次那样感到惊讶，因此也没有那么尴尬。同样地，他伸出双臂环抱住她的后背，也拥抱了她。他们一起分享这一刻，在客厅中央相拥，壁炉的火光照亮了他们。

Slowly, they separated from each other, both looking rather embarrassed by all this sudden close contact with each other.

渐渐地，他们彼此分开，两人都因这突如其来的亲密接触而显得颇为尴尬。

"Thank you Shinji," Asuka repeated again.

“谢谢你，真嗣。”明日香再次重复道。

"You've already said that twice."

"你已经说过两次了。"

"I know that. But still, I feel like I should. I didn't even get you anything, and yet you-"

"我知道。但不知为何，我还是觉得应该说。我甚至没给你准备任何东西，而你却——"

"You made dinner." "你做了晚饭。"

"But you got me this," Asuka replied.

"但这是你给我的，" 明日香回答道。

"Yeah, well, it took a long time afterall," Shinji said.

"是啊，毕竟花了很长时间，" 真嗣说。

"It was worth it," mumbled Asuka.

"这是值得的，" 明日香咕哝着。

Still feeling embarrassed, they looked away from each other, unsure what to say to each other now. What could they say after that?

依然感到尴尬，他们彼此避开目光，不确定现在该对对方说些什么。在那之后，他们还能说什么呢？

"What now?" voiced Shinji.

“现在怎么办？”真嗣开口道。

"I don't know," said Asuka as she shook her head. "Don't you usually practice about now?"

“我不知道，”明日香摇着头说，“你通常不是现在该练习吗？”

"...I don't have to do it today. It's Christmas after all."

"...今天不用做。毕竟今天是圣诞节。"

"Then what? It may be Christmas, but the day is fast ending."

"那然后呢？虽然今天是圣诞节，但这一天也快结束了。"

"We could just stay here for the time being," said Shinji, glancing back towards the couch.

"我们可以暂时留在这里，" 真嗣说着，回头看向沙发。

"I suppose," said Asuka. “我想也是，”明日香说道。

Sitting on the couch again, they wrapped themselves in a blanket, but weren't sitting directly next to each other. They were close enough to touch each other, but they didn't. Both were wondering about what had just occurred, but were afraid to voice how they felt.

他们再次坐在沙发上，裹着一条毯子，但没有直接坐在一起。他们靠得足够近，可以触碰到对方，但他们没有这么做。两人都在思考刚刚发生的事情，却害怕表达自己的感受。

They continued like this, talking occasionally but mostly keeping to themselves, until Shinji stood up.

他们就这样继续着，偶尔交谈，但大多时候各自沉默，直到真嗣站起身来。

"I think the day is coming to a close," he said.

"我想这一天快要结束了，"他说。

Asuka nodded, but didn't say anything. She was still deep in her own thoughts.

明日香点了点头，但没有说话。她仍沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"Well...I'm going to bed. Night Asuka."

"嗯...我要去睡了。晚安，明日香。"

As Shinji began to leave however, Asuka stood up to stop him.

然而，当真嗣开始离开时，明日香站起身来阻止他。

"Wait..." “等等……”

Stopping on the bottom stair, Shinji turned around to see Asuka walking towards him.

在最后一级台阶上停下，真嗣转过身，看到明日香朝他走来。

"I'm going to bed as well I think, but I don't want to be wearing this while I sleep. Can you help me get it off. I can't remember the last time I ever wore a necklace, so unclasping it is a little..."

"我想我也该去睡觉了，但穿着这个睡觉可不行。你能帮我把它取下来吗？我都不记得上次戴项链是什么时候了，解开它还真有点……"

Shinji understood, and helped Asuka with this. Handing the necklace over to her, Asuka placed it in its case, and the stuffed it in her pocket. Together, they walked up the stairs, Shinji in the lead, and Asuka following him. When they reached the second landing, Shinji walked to his bedroom door, and Asuka passed him, walking to her own room. Entering her room, she walked over to her bed, and removed the case from her pocket, and placed it on the nightstand. She stared at it for several seconds, before she removed her shirt and pants, and threw on something more comfortable for sleeping.

真嗣明白了，便帮明日香解开项链。明日香接过项链，放进盒子里，然后塞进口袋。两人一起走上楼梯，真嗣在前，明日香紧随其后。到达二楼时，真嗣走向自己的卧室，而明日香则超过他，走向自己的房间。进入房间后，她走到床边，从口袋里拿出盒子，放在床头柜上。她盯着它看了几秒钟，然后脱下衬衫和裤子，换上更舒适的睡衣。

As she was about to get in bed however, she stopped. Was this what she wanted right now? No, it wasn't.

然而，正当她准备上床时，她停住了。这是她现在想要的吗？不，并不是。

Turning around, she walked back to her bedroom door and opened it, but was surprised to see Shinji standing just beyond it. He was standing there in a short sleeve shirt and shorts, clearly dressed for bed, but quite obviously, not in his own room

她转身走回卧室门口，打开门，却惊讶地看到真嗣就站在门外。他穿着短袖衬衫和短裤，显然是准备睡觉的装扮，但很明显，这不是在他的房间里。

"Shinji?" asked Asuka quietly.

"真嗣？" 明日香轻声问道。

"...If you're okay with it-" he began, but Asuka cut him off.

"...如果你觉得可以的话——" 他开口说道，但明日香打断了他。

"Don't say anything else; I don't want to hear it."

"别再说什么了；我不想听。"

Turning away from him, Asuka returned to her own bed, and crawled under the covers. Instead of moving to one side of the bed however, she remained in the middle. It took Shinji several seconds after Asuka had already climbed in bed, for him to follow her lead. Slowly, he walked to the opposite side of the bed, and crawled in. He was unsure whether to move closer to Asuka or not, but felt his skip a beat when he heard her speak.

明日香转身离开他，回到自己的床上，钻进了被窝。然而，她并没有挪到床的一侧，而是留在了中间。真嗣在她已经上床几秒钟后才跟着行动。他慢慢地走到床的另一边，爬了进去。他不确定是否应该靠近明日香，但当听到她说话时，他的心跳漏了一拍。

"Hey Shinji, turn this way for a moment."

"嘿，真嗣，转过这边来一下。"

Shinji did so, and was greeted by Asuka's face filling his entire vision. She had a small smile on her face, and had moved closer to him so that she was directly beside him.

真嗣照做了，结果眼前全是明日香的脸。她脸上带着淡淡的微笑，已经靠近到他身边，直接站在了他旁边。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji, hesitantly.

"明日香？" 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Asuka didn't immediately reply; she was too absorbed in this moment to feel like replying immediately. This warmth was relaxing in a way that even the dinner she had made didn't compare. Whether it was the comfort, or the feeling of being close, Asuka didn't want these things to stop.

明日香并没有立即回应；她完全沉浸在这一刻，以至于不想立刻回复。这份温暖以一种晚餐都无法比拟的方式让人放松。无论是那份舒适，还是那种亲近感，明日香都不希望它们停止。

"Goodnight Shinji," said Asuka, as she closed her eyes, while still facing him, and began drifting off to sleep.

"晚安，真嗣。" 明日香说道，她闭上眼睛，依然面对着他，渐渐进入了梦乡。

Shinji didn't reply for a longtime, until Asuka had already fallen asleep, and was content to just watch her sleep for a while.

真嗣许久没有回应，直到明日香已经入睡，他满足于只是静静地看着她安睡一会儿。

"Goodnight Asuka," he eventually said, as he closed his eyes, the last thing he remembered being Asuka's peaceful sleeping face, as he himself fell asleep beside her.

“晚安，明日香。”他最终说道，闭上眼睛，最后记得的是明日香安详的睡颜，而他自己也随即在她身旁沉沉睡去。

Okay, here we go. First off, I'd like to thank everybody that stuck with me over this month of updates. It has been a roller coaster of a ride, and honestly I need to take a break for a bit. I've been putting off some of the other stuff that I've been writing, and am ready to continue working on that. I'll continue updating, of course, so hopefully we'll see another update sometime next month. On to other stuff.

好了，我们开始吧。首先，我要感谢所有在这一个月更新期间一直陪伴我的朋友们。这真是一场跌宕起伏的旅程，说实话我需要休息一下。我推迟了一些其他正在写的作品，现在准备继续那些创作。当然，我会继续更新，希望下个月能再见到新的章节。接下来谈点别的。

Two of Us is of course a direct sequel to Spawn of Adam, and I've tried to take this story on a similar path to the first nineteen chapters of Spawn of Adam. The eighteenth and nineteenth chapter of SoA, was a turning point in the story, because Shinji and Asuka were on the verge of accepting their feelings for each other, but then Asuka's memories of Shinji were destroyed in the twenty-first chapter. As we continue Two of Us, we are going to see what would have happened if those memories hadn't been destroyed.

《我们俩》无疑是《亚当之子》的直接续集，我试图让这个故事沿着《亚当之子》前十九章的相似轨迹发展。《亚当之子》的第十八和第十九章是一个转折点，因为真嗣和明日香即将接受彼此的感情，但随后明日香关于真嗣的记忆在第二十一章被抹去了。随着《我们俩》的继续，我们将看到如果那些记忆没有被抹去会发生什么。

Continuing on, Two of Us has so far had two arcs, and the second is just wrapping up. We had the beginning of Shinji and Asuka's interactions with each other, from learning about their connection with Nerv, and discovering more about each other, and the world they live in. The second half, was of course largely focused on Shinji's beginning to understand his AT-field, and who he was in general, while also beginning to slowly develop the romantic relationship between them. The third arc, will be focusing on their relationship even more, and eventually move into the second half of this story. Yes, we're almost to the halfway mark. The next chapter will pick up again, during the last few days of February, as the winter season begins to disappear.

继续前行，《我们俩》迄今已完成了两个篇章，第二个篇章刚刚收尾。故事从真嗣和明日香了解彼此与 NERV 的关联开始，逐渐揭开他们各自以及所处世界的更多秘密。后半部分则主要围绕真嗣开始理解自己的 AT 力场以及自我认知的探索，同时两人间的浪漫关系也缓慢萌芽。第三篇章将更加深入地聚焦于他们的关系，并逐步过渡到故事的后半段。没错，我们已接近中点。接下来的第 1001 章将在二月底冬日渐逝之际重新开启。

This chapter in particular, was really enjoyable to write, as I called back certain things that happened in the chapters Small Steps, and Continuation, from SoA. I always considered those two chapters to be sort of a bundle, and I think I actually split those two chapters up when I was writing them. The necklace that Shinji gave Asuka, was a reference to the earrings he had gotten her before. I debated for a while what the necklace should actually be, and at one point thought to just have it be a single dolphin, the same as that from Continuation. A bit cliched, so I decided to just go with the blue gemstone we see here, which is ultimately what the dolphin earrings were about.

这篇{{101}}特别令人愉快，因为我回顾了《小步》和《延续》这两章中发生的一些事情，这两章我一直视为一体，写作时我确实将它们分开了。真嗣送给明日香的项链，是对之前他送给她耳环的呼应。我纠结了一阵子项链应该是什么样的，一度考虑只用一个海豚形状，就像《延续》中的那样。有点老套，所以我最终选择了这里看到的蓝宝石，这其实也是海豚耳环的寓意所在。

Anyways, I've been talking for far too long, so I'm gonna end this extremely long authors note at that. Till next time.

总之，我已经说了太久，所以这篇超长的作者笔记就到此为止了。下次见。

### Chapter 19: Onward

Right, well lets see if I remember how this works. Seven months? Or is it eight now? Well, nothing since December either way, but here I am updating, with not one, but two chapter today. I've got tons to say, but I'll leave all that till the end of the other chapter. And no, I'm not abandoning this.

好吧，让我看看我是否还记得这是怎么回事。七个月？还是八个月了？无论如何，自去年十二月以来就没有更新过，但我现在回来了，今天不是一篇，而是两篇 chapter。我有很多话要说，但我会把那些留到另一篇 chapter 的末尾。不，我没有放弃这个。

As the morning sun rose, Asuka slowly opened her eyes. Naturally, her gaze immediately locked onto the young boy sleeping beside her, his breath tickling her nose. Fighting against the urge to pinch his noes closed, Asuka slowly sat up, and crawled out of the bed that was shared between them. She didn't know how many times she had woken up like this, but it was certainly passed double digits at this point. Sighing lightly, she crawled out of bed, being careful not to wake him.

当清晨的阳光升起，明日香缓缓睁开眼睛。自然而然地，她的目光立刻锁定在睡在她身边的少年身上，他的呼吸轻轻拂过她的鼻子。强忍着捏住他鼻子的冲动，明日香慢慢坐起身，从他们共享的床上爬了出来。她不知道自己已经这样醒来多少次了，但肯定已经超过两位数了。轻轻叹了口气，她小心翼翼地爬下床，生怕吵醒他。

Two months had passed since that Christmas day, and it was now late February. The snow had long since thawed, and even the rain had slowly begun to subside. In other words, spring was slowly approaching. They had both agreed that once the season changed, there would no longer be any reason to remain in that house. This time was fast approaching.

自那个圣诞节以来，已经过去了两个月，如今已是二月底。雪早已融化，连绵的雨水也逐渐减少。换言之，春天正缓缓临近。他们曾一致同意，一旦季节更替，就没有理由继续留在那栋房子里了。这一刻即将到来。

Still, in the two months since Christmas, their relationship hadn't changed much. Though they occasionally slept together, nothing else had happened. During the nights that were particularly cold in January, this happened more often than not, but as the winter season began to wind down, it was a less common occurrence. Last night however, well, Asuka wasn't particularly cold, but she just wanted the comfort of Shinji beside her. She wasn't oblivious to her feelings, but neither did she voice them; Shinji was in a similar boat it seemed.

尽管如此，自圣诞节以来的两个月里，他们的关系并未发生太大变化。虽然偶尔会睡在一起，但除此之外别无他事。在一月那些特别寒冷的夜晚，这种情况时有发生，但随着冬季逐渐减弱，这种现象变得不那么常见了。然而昨晚，嗯，明日香并不特别冷，但她只是想要真嗣在身边的安慰。她并非对自己的感情一无所知，但也未曾表露；真嗣似乎也处于类似的境地。

After crawling out of her bed, Asuka walked into the adjacent bathroom. There was never any order to which room they slept in, as sometimes it was Shinji's, and sometimes it was hers. If she was honest, she preferred her own, more for the larger bed space than anything. Having an adjacent bathroom didn't hurt either though.

从床上爬起来后，明日香走进了隔壁的浴室。他们睡觉的房间从不固定，有时是真嗣的房间，有时则是她的。老实说，她更喜欢自己的房间，主要是因为床铺更宽敞，而且有个相邻的浴室也挺方便的。

Standing in front of the mirror, Asuka grabbed a nearby bottle of water, and used its contents to wake herself further. Drying her face off, she then looked back at her own reflection in the mirror. Two months had gone by, but it was hard to tell whether she had changed at all. Maybe she was taller, but again, how was one to tell whether oneself had grown in a certain period of time by simply looking at a reflection? Well, maybe Shinji could tell whether she had grown at all, since Asuka had noticed Shinji was slightly taller now. They noticed things about each other, but not about themselves.

站在镜子前，明日香拿起旁边的一瓶水，用里面的水让自己更清醒些。擦干脸后，她再次看向镜中的自己。两个月过去了，但她很难看出自己是否有所改变。也许她长高了，但仅凭镜子里的倒影，一个人又怎么能确定自己在某个时间段内是否真的长高了呢？嗯，或许真嗣能看出她是否有所成长，因为明日香注意到真嗣现在稍微高了一些。他们注意到了彼此的变化，却往往忽视了自己的。

Continuing to wake herself up, Asuka brushed her teeth, and then changed into something more suitable then what she had been sleeping in. Sometimes, she still wondered how she was able to sleep beside Shinji, when she was dressed in only a shirt and shorts, but she had gradually stopped caring she supposed.

为了彻底清醒，明日香继续刷牙，然后换上了比睡衣更合适的衣服。有时，她仍会疑惑自己是怎么穿着衬衫和短裤就能在真嗣旁边入睡的，但她想自己已经逐渐不再在意这些了。

Leaving the bathroom, she glanced over at Shinji who was still sleeping soundly. It had been a while since Asuka was the first to awake, so she decided that she'd make breakfast for the hell of it. Shinji needed a break every once in a while.

离开浴室，她瞥了一眼仍在熟睡的真嗣。已经有一段时间是明日香先醒来了，于是她决定做顿早餐，就当是找点乐子。真嗣偶尔也需要放松一下。

Shinji had changed since Christmas. He had come to terms with his AT-field, along with his unusual powers. He was calmer, and less prone to getting angry for no reason. He had reached a level of proficiency with his AT-field, where he didn't need to practice with it anymore. He hadn't used it for more than a month, but Asuka knew that being able to control it easily was a huge burden off Shinji's shoulders. If he was required to use it for some reason, it wouldn't become a problem.

自圣诞节以来，真嗣发生了变化。他接受了他的 AT 力场，以及他那不同寻常的力量。他变得更加冷静，不再无缘无故地发怒。他对 AT 力场的掌握已经达到了无需再练习的程度。他已经一个多月没有使用过它了，但明日香知道，能够轻松控制它大大减轻了真嗣的负担。如果出于某种原因需要使用它，也不会成为问题。

Walking downstairs, Asuka stopped her feet as she reached the bottom of the stairs. This house had become their home in the short time that they were living here, and Asuka couldn't help but feel somewhat sad that they would be leaving it soon. She had pleasant memories here afterall. As she thought this, she placed her palm against her chest, feeling the necklace underneath her shirt. Though it had felt awkward at first, Asuka now kept the necklace that Shinji had given her with her at nearly every moment of a given day. Even now, she still had difficulty expressing her feelings over receiving such a gift. Shinji didn't seem to mind though.

走下楼梯，明日香在到达底部时停下了脚步。这栋房子在短短的时间里已成为他们的家，明日香不禁感到有些悲伤，因为他们很快就要离开这里了。毕竟，她在这里留下了许多美好的回忆。想到这里，她将手掌放在胸前，感受着衬衫下那条项链。虽然一开始觉得有些别扭，但明日香现在几乎每天都会随身带着真嗣送给她的这条项链。即便如此，她仍然难以表达收到这份礼物时的感受。不过，真嗣似乎并不介意。

Entering the kitchen, she started preparing breakfast. They still had some leftovers from dinner the night before, so Asuka largely made use of this. Waste not, want not, she supposed. After she finished, she sat down at the dining room table, and began eating, just as she heard movement from the floor above; it seemed Shinji was finally waking up. Moments later, she saw his groggy face plodding downstairs, still clad in his sleepwear.

走进厨房，她开始准备早餐。昨晚的晚餐还剩下一些剩菜，所以明日香主要利用了这些。她想，不浪费，就不会缺乏。做好后，她坐在餐厅的餐桌旁，开始用餐，就在这时，她听到了楼上的动静；看来真嗣终于醒了。片刻后，她看到他睡眼惺忪的脸庞缓缓走下楼梯，仍然穿着睡衣。

"You're up early," said Shinji as he reached the bottom of the stairs, and walked over to her.

“你起得真早，”真嗣走到楼梯底部时说道，并向她走来。

"I can get up early if I want," shrugged Asuka.

“如果我想的话，我可以早起。”明日香耸了耸肩。

"Well, thank you for making breakfast."

“嗯，谢谢你做早餐。”

"I really didn't do much, since most of it is leftovers from last nights dinner."

我其实没做太多，大部分都是昨晚晚餐的剩菜。

"...Still," started Shinji, as he sat down beside her briefly.

"...还是，" 真嗣开口道，他短暂地坐在她旁边。

"What?" asked Asuka, seeing the unusual expression on Shinji's face.

"什么？" 明日香问道，注意到真嗣脸上不寻常的表情。

"...No, never mind," said Shinji as he stood up to get his own plate.

"...不，没什么，" 真嗣说着站起身去拿自己的盘子。

"Shinji?" asked Asuka, her voice slightly low. Whenever her tone changed like this, Shinji knew that there was no point in trying to avoid the topic. He had learned this from past experience.

"真嗣？" 明日香问道，她的声音略显低沉。每当她的语气如此变化时，真嗣就知道试图回避话题是徒劳的。他从过去的经验中学到了这一点。

"I guess I was just thinking," said Shinji from the kitchen, "when we should start packing things up."

"我想我只是在考虑，" 真嗣从厨房里说，"我们什么时候应该开始收拾东西。"

"Meaning?" asked Asuka. "什么意思？" 明日香问道。

Walking back into the dining room, Shinji sat down beside Asuka, and paused before eating.

走回餐厅，真嗣在明日香旁边坐下，吃饭前停顿了一下。

"I mean, that we should start thinking about leaving here. We did say that afterall back in December."

“我是说，我们应该开始考虑离开这里了。毕竟我们在去年十二月就说过这事。”

"...Yeah," mumbled Asuka, her prior tone gone.

“……嗯，”明日香咕哝着，之前的语气消失了。

"You don't sound very enthusiastic," commented Shinji.

“你听起来不怎么热情啊，”真嗣评论道。

"Can you blame me? We've lived here for so long now, that this became our home for a short time. It almost felt...normal I suppose. So leaving it suddenly feels..."

"你能怪我吗？我们在这里住了这么久，这里短暂地成了我们的家。几乎感觉...正常了。所以突然离开感觉..."

"But you still want to?"

"但你还是想走？"

"Of course I do," sighed Asuka. "But right now is a little..."

"当然我想，" 明日香叹息道。"但现在是有点..."

A little what? Was Asuka having second thoughts now that it had come to this moment? No, she didn't think so, but certainly this house had changed things for her. She was aware of certain things that she hadn't known before. What would happen when they left? Would those things change? Would her feelings change? This place was more of a home to her than any place before now, the home that she shared with Shinji. Thinking about this, a brief blush appeared on her face, which didn't go unnoticed by Shinji.

一点点什么？难道是到了这一刻，明日香开始犹豫了吗？不，她不这么认为，但这房子确实改变了她的一些想法。她意识到了一些之前未曾知晓的事情。当他们离开时，这些事情会改变吗？她的感情会改变吗？这个地方对她来说比以往任何地方都更像家，她和真嗣共同的家。想到这里，她脸上泛起了一抹淡淡的红晕，真嗣注意到了这一点。

"You okay?" asked Shinji in question to the blush that had appeared on her cheeks.

“你还好吗？”真嗣问道，目光落在她脸颊上的红晕。

"I'm fine," grumbled Asuka as she stood up suddenly, taking her plate with her. Shinji didn't say anything in reply to this. During these past two months, Shinji had seen this expression from her a multitude of times, mainly when they woke up in the morning. Well, he wasn't exempt from that embarrassment either, he supposed. Sleeping in the same bed as Asuka still felt awkward at times, even though it had already happened many times.

“我没事，”明日香咕哝着突然站起身，端起自己的盘子。真嗣对此没有回应。过去的两个月里，他多次见过她这样的表情，尤其是在早晨醒来时。嗯，他自己也免不了这种尴尬，他想。和明日香同床共枕有时仍会感到不自在，尽管这已经发生过很多次了。

Together, they rinsed the dishes they used, and placed them back on the cabinet shelf. Asuka had become much more willing to assist Shinji in daily chores such as these, and even enjoyed herself during these times. Initially, they wanted to have time to themselves occasionally, but that wasn't as common anymore. Before they realized it, they had begun to spend more time with each other, if that was even possible, given their current situation.

他们一起清洗了用过的餐具，并将其放回橱柜架上。如今，明日香更愿意协助真嗣处理这些日常琐事，甚至乐在其中。起初，他们偶尔还想拥有自己的时间，但这种情况已不再常见。不知不觉间，他们开始花更多时间陪伴彼此，尽管在当前情况下，这似乎已达到极限。

"So...Shinji?" Asuka suddenly spoke as started drying off a plate.

“那么...真嗣？” 明日香突然开口，一边开始擦干一个盘子。

"Hmm?" he replied. “嗯？” 他回应道。

"Have you thought about where we should be headed at least?"

“你至少想过我们应该去哪里吗？”

"Well, no, I haven't," answered Shinji truthfully. He had two months to think about this, but back then, it had seemed like an infinite amount of time. They said that they'd leave, but where would they go exactly? Shinji didn't have anything in mind, and he didn't think Asuka did either.

“嗯，没有，”真嗣如实回答。他有两个月的时间来思考这个问题，但那时，时间似乎是无限的。他们说要离开，但具体会去哪里呢？真嗣心里没底，他也不认为明日香有什么打算。

"Don't you think we should have somewhat of an idea where we're headed?" asked Asuka.

“你不觉得我们应该对要去的地方有个大致的了解吗？”明日香问道。

"I thought you said you didn't want to think about this right now?"

“我以为你说过现在不想考虑这个？”

"Thinking about it is fine: we don't have to leave this instant after all. Still, before I pick up and move everything here to an entirely different location, I'd like to have semblance of where we're going."

想想也无妨：毕竟我们不必立刻动身。不过，在我把这里的一切搬到完全不同的地方之前，我希望能大致了解我们将去往何方。

"I guess you have a point," nodded Shinji.

“我想你说得有道理，”真嗣点头道。

"Do you still have that map you found when we initially came to Tokyo-2?" asked Asuka.

"你还记得我们刚到东京-2 时找到的那张地图吗？" 明日香问道。

"...Maybe," said Shinji after a brief pause. "If so, it'd probably be stashed inside my closet or something."

"...或许吧，" 真嗣稍作停顿后说，"如果有的话，大概就藏在我的衣柜里之类的。"

"Go find it then. I'll finish up here," said Asuka.

"那就去找找看。我这边马上就弄完了，" 明日香说。

So, responding to Asuka's wishes, Shinji let her finish washing the dishes, and began walking upstairs to his room. It had been a long time since he had thought about that map he had found those many months ago, but he supposed it was a good thing he had decided to keep it.

于是，应着明日香的心愿，真嗣让她完成了洗碗的工作，自己则开始上楼回房间。他已经很久没有想起那张几个月前发现的东京-2 和日本的地图了，但他觉得当初决定保留它是个明智之举。

Entering his room, he opened his closet door and began rummaging around, looking for the map of Tokyo-2 and Japan. His closet was filled with things that he hadn't thought of in a while. The camping backpack that he had carried from Tokyo-3 to here, was tucked away in a corner, along with the sleeping bag which he had spent many nights in. The top shelf had a layer of dust coating the top, but Shinji found the map in a far back corner, underneath several old books. Pulling the map out, he unfolded it, and looked briefly at it, before tucking it under his arm, and walked back downstairs.

进入房间后，他打开衣柜门，开始翻找那张东京-2 和日本的地图。他的衣柜里堆满了许久未曾想起的物品。从第三新东京市带来的露营背包被塞在一个角落，连同他在其中度过许多夜晚的睡袋。顶层架子上积了一层灰尘，但真嗣在角落深处找到了地图，它被几本旧书压在下面。他抽出地图，展开来看了一眼，然后夹在腋下，走下楼去。

As he entered the kitchen, Asuka had just finished washing the dishes, and was drying her hand on a towel.

当他走进厨房时，明日香刚洗完碗，正用毛巾擦手。

"That didn't take long," commented Asuka.

“没花多少时间嘛。”明日香评论道。

Taking the map from Shinji, she walked passed him, and spread it out on the kitchen table, so they could look at it together. One side of the map showed a detailed map of Tokyo-2, while the other showed the entirety of Japan. Because of Second Impact, the sea levels had risen drastically, making most of the coastal cities submerged in water, meaning that they would be going further inland.

从真嗣手中接过地图，她从他身边走过，在厨房的桌子上展开，以便他们一起查看。地图的一侧展示了东京-2 的详细地图，而另一侧则展示了整个日本的全貌。由于第二次冲击，海平面急剧上升，使得大部分沿海城市被淹没在水中，这意味着他们将向内陆更深处进发。

"So where should we go?" asked Shinji.

"那我们应该去哪儿？" 真嗣问道。

"You're the one who's Japanese, so you should have some idea about your own nation."

"你是日本人，应该对自己的国家有些了解吧。"

"Geography wasn't something I ever paid attention to in school."

"地理课上我从来没认真听过。"

Even though he said this, he still stared at the map for nearly a minute. It was obvious that they would be going inland further. Most of Japan's largest cities were all coastal, and the majority of those had disappeared because of Second Impact, so Tokyo-2 and Tokyo-3 were the largest currently. Further inland, though, there wasn't much to speak of either. There were small towns, but most people had moved to Tokyo-2 and Tokyo-3, which were considered the commercially friendly.

尽管他这么说，目光却依旧在地图上停留了近一分钟。显然，他们将深入内陆。日本大部分大城市都位于沿海，且多数因第二次冲击而消失，因此目前最大的城市是东京-2 和东京-3。然而，内陆地区同样乏善可陈。虽有小城镇，但大多数人已迁至被视为商业友好的东京-2 和东京-3。

"Well, have you made a decision?" asked Asuka.

“那么，你决定好了吗？”明日香问道。

"No, but I imagine if we move further inland, we'll find something eventually."

“不，但我想如果我们继续向内陆深入，最终会找到些什么的。”

"Thats not a very reassuring notion," groaned Asuka. "What about food and water? If we stay someplace that has a limited supply of those essentials, I don't see much of a reason to stay in said area."

“这可不是什么令人安心的想法，”明日香抱怨道，“食物和水怎么办？如果停留的地方这些必需品供应有限，我看不出留在那里的理由。”

"So you would rather stay here?"

"所以你宁愿留在这里？"

"I already said how I felt on that matter, though granted, we could live here much longer because of the near infinite supply of canned food. A change of scenery wouldn't hurt though."

"关于那件事，我已经表达了我的感受，不过话说回来，我们确实可以在这里住得更久，因为罐头食品几乎是无限的。换个环境也不错。"

"Honestly, I just feel like picking a direction and driving that way," said Shinji.

"老实说，我只是想选个方向开车走，" 真嗣说道。"

"Good thing there's two of us then, because I won't allow us to leave without some sense of where we're headed."

"幸好我们有两个，不然我可不会让我们就这样毫无头绪地离开。"

"When did you become so worried about such things?" wondered Shinji.

"你什么时候开始对这些事情这么在意了？" 真嗣疑惑道。"

Shrugging, Asuka said, "I've had plenty of time to think about where I want my life to go."

耸耸肩，明日香说："我一直有很多时间去思考我想要的生活方向。"

She didn't say anything else on the subject, and simply left Shinji hanging on her words. Leaving the dining room, Asuka walked into the living room and sat down on the couch in front of the fire which was roaring. Shinji followed her after several moments, and naturally sat beside her. There was one point when this would have felt unnatural to them, but now the complete opposite was true. In fact, Asuka very slowly began to lean against Shinji, using his body as something similar to a support beam. Shinji didn't complain like he might have done in the past, but accepted what Asuka was doing. Bodily contact between them was much more open than it had once been, and this was largely attributed to the fact that they slept in the same bed occasionally.

她没有再对此事多言，只是让真嗣悬着心等待她的下文。离开餐厅后，明日香走进客厅，坐在了熊熊燃烧的壁炉前的沙发上。真嗣片刻后跟了进来，自然而然地坐在她身旁。曾经有一段时间，这样的举动对他们来说会显得不自然，但如今情况完全相反。实际上，明日香缓缓地开始倚靠在真嗣身上，将他的身体当作类似支撑柱的存在。真嗣并未像过去那样抱怨，而是接受了明日香的行为。他们之间的身体接触比以往更加开放，这很大程度上归因于他们偶尔会同床共枕。

"Did you not sleep well or something?" asked Shinji.

“你没睡好吗，还是怎么了？” 真嗣问道。

"No, I slept fine," mumbled Asuka, her body pressed against Shinji's. "This is more comfortable then sitting upright though."

"不，我睡得很好，"明日香咕哝着，她的身体紧贴着真嗣。"不过这样比直挺挺地坐着舒服多了。"

"I see," sighed Shinji. "这样啊，"真嗣叹了口气。"

"Does this bother you?" "这样会让你不舒服吗？"

'Rather than bother me, I think its the opposite,' thought Shinji, but he wasn't about to say that to Asuka.

“与其说是打扰我，不如说是我打扰了它，”真嗣心想，但他可不打算对明日香这么说。

"No," he instead said simply.

“不，”他简单地回答道。

"I was gonna say, if this bothers you, how is it that we can sleep beside each other and be fine."

“我想说的是，如果这让你感到困扰，那我们又是怎么能在彼此身边安然入睡的呢。”

Asuka's face flushed briefly as she said this, but it passed quickly. It was always strange voicing the fact that they slept together on certain occasions, but she had mostly gotten over that embarrassment. Not just her own life, but Shinji's as well had changed so much in the time that they knew each other.

明日香说这话时，脸上短暂地泛起了红晕，但很快便消退了。每次提及他们偶尔同床共枕的事实，总让她感到些许怪异，不过这种尴尬她大多已经克服。不仅仅是她自己的生活，连真嗣的也在他们相识的这段时间里发生了翻天覆地的变化。

Shinji's reaction was similar to Asuka's in regards to what she had said, except that he rather embarrassingly pushed her away after she said this.

真嗣对明日香所说的话反应与她相似，只是在她说了这话后，他颇为尴尬地将她推开了。

"What?" replied Asuka, annoyed that the person she had been leaning against was no longer willing to allow that.

“什么？”明日香不悦地回应，她倚靠的人不再愿意让她依靠，这让她感到恼火。

"Nothing," said Shinji, though he wasn't looking at Asuka. In turn, she raised an eyebrow, but didn't say anything, and instead sank into the couch cushions with her arms crossed. Asuka enjoyed teasing Shinji, but occasionally, he did retaliate back.

“没什么。”真嗣说道，尽管他没有看着明日香。而她则挑了挑眉，但没有说话，只是双臂交叉，陷进了沙发垫里。明日香喜欢逗弄真嗣，但偶尔，他也会反击。

Standing up suddenly, Asuka was momentarily caught of guard as Shinji did this. At first she thought that Shinji was angry at her, though for what, she had no idea. Slowly though, she began to realize that she was wrong in her initial assumption.

明日香突然站起来，一时间被真嗣的举动搞得措手不及。起初她以为真嗣在生她的气，尽管原因不明。但渐渐地，她开始意识到自己最初的猜测是错误的。

"What are you doing?" asked Asuka.

“你在做什么？”明日香问道。

"I think I'm going to start packing," shrugged Shinji.

“我想我开始打包了。” 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"Right now?" wondered Asuka, "isn't that a little premature?"

“现在吗？”明日香疑惑道，“是不是有点太早了？”

"Better to get it over now than later," shrugged Shinji. "Besides, it isn't like there's anything better to do, and I don't really feel like lazing around forever."

"现在解决总比拖到后面好，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"再说了，也没什么更好的事情可做，我也不想一直无所事事。"

"If you say so," sighed Asuka.

"随你便吧，" 明日香叹了口气。"

"Are you going to start, or put it off for later?"

"你是打算现在开始，还是推迟到以后？"

"Do you really need to ask that?" replied Asuka.

“你真的需要问这个吗？”明日香回答道。

Shinji supposed that she had a point. Either way though, they would be leaving eventually, so packing everything away was something that would definitely happen. Shinji was like Asuka, in that he had come to call this house home in the time that they lived together in it. Even though he thought that, he couldn't explain it, but he felt eager in the prospect of moving on. It wasn't simply about leaving Tokyo-2 either, or moving past the idea of his AT-field, which he had already done afterall. It had more to do with his and Asuka's growing relationship. Currently, it almost felt like they were simply roommates who shared a house. Maybe that wasn't exactly true, but it felt along those lines at least. By moving into a different town, with different streets, different houses, and a new place to call home, Shinji felt that they were taking another step in their relationship, if it could be called that at this point. Did Shinji have a relationship with Asuka? Relationship was a rather vague word afterall, as it could mean a multitude of different things. In regards to that certain aspect of the term relationship, Shinji sometimes felt it was true, and then other times was unsure.

真嗣觉得她说的有道理。无论如何，他们终将离开，所以收拾行李是必然的事。真嗣和明日香一样，在这段时间里已经把这栋房子当成了家。尽管如此，他无法解释，但内心对继续前进充满期待。这不仅仅是因为要离开第二东京，或是超越对 A.T.力场的概念，毕竟他早已做到了。更重要的是他和明日香日益发展的关系。目前，他们几乎就像只是共享一个屋檐的室友。也许并不完全准确，但至少给人这种感觉。搬到一个新的城镇，走过不同的街道，住进不同的房子，拥有一个新家，真嗣觉得这是他们关系中的又一步，尽管现在称之为关系还有些模糊。真嗣和明日香之间有关系吗？“关系”这个词相当模糊，它可以指代许多不同的事物。就这个词的某些方面而言，真嗣有时觉得确实存在，有时又感到不确定。

Walking up the flight of stairs, he entered his bedroom, and sat down on his bed. He had slept in here for more than two months, and would be lying if he said he wasn't going to miss this. Well, humans adapted to their environments, so he would grow used to the next place as well.

走上楼梯，他进入了卧室，坐在床上。在这里他已经睡了两个多月，如果说他不会怀念这里，那是在撒谎。好吧，人类适应环境的能力很强，他也会逐渐习惯下一个地方的。

Standing up, he walked to his closet door and opened it. He had several jackets hanging here, but most of these were seldom worn, as the ones by the front door were his preferred favorites. The reason he opened this, was of course because of something he had tucked away in the back corner. Grabbing the shoulder straps of the object, he withdrew the backpack that he had brought from Tokyo-3, all the way to here. It was one of the many things that he had carried in his journey with Asuka, along with the sleeping bag which was still attached to the back of it.

他站起身，走向衣橱门并将其打开。里面挂着几件夹克，但大多很少穿着，因为门口的那几件才是他的心头好。他之所以打开这个衣橱，当然是因为里面藏了些东西在角落里。他抓住物件的肩带，取出了从东京-3 一路带来的背包。这是他与明日香旅途中携带的众多物品之一，连同仍固定在背包后的睡袋。

Unzipping it, a musty smell arose from inside the confines of the backpack which hadn't been used in months. Shinji decided to let it air out before he starting packing his belongings away. Still, besides that, there was several other things which he needed to prepare.

拉开拉链，一股霉味从几个月未用的背包内飘散出来。真嗣决定先让它通通风，再开始收拾自己的物品。不过，除了这个，还有几样东西他需要准备。

Leaving his bedroom, he went back downstairs, but was stopped by Asuka.

离开卧室，他回到楼下，却被明日香拦住了。

"Already done packing?" she asked.

“已经打包好了？”她问道。

"No. My backpack needs to air out for a while, but I figured there was something else I could do in the meantime. I'm assuming that we'll be bringing the tent with us anyway."

“没有。我的背包需要晾一会儿，但我想在这期间可以做点别的事情。我猜我们还是会带上帐篷的。”

"Oh," said Asuka. She had admittedly forgotten about the tent, but now that Shinji mentioned it, it probably was a good idea to bring it. Japan wasn't a large island, and wouldn't take very long to drive from one side to the other, but just in case, it was smart to have a place to sleep.

"哦，" 明日香说道。她确实忘了帐篷这回事，但现在听真嗣提起，带上它或许是个好主意。日本虽不是个大岛，从一端开车到另一端也花不了太多时间，但以防万一，有个睡觉的地方总是明智的。

"I suppose we should," agreed Asuka.

"我想我们应该带上，" 明日香同意道。

How long had it been since they had last used the tent? On the grassy lawn of the park within Tokyo-2 was the last time, and that was over two an a half months ago now. Shinji hadn't thought about the tent in a long time, but was glad that they had kept it.

他们上次用这帐篷是什么时候？在东京-2 公园的草坪上，那已是两个半月多以前的事了。真嗣很久没想起过这帐篷，但很高兴他们一直保留着它。

Opening the side door to the garage, Shinji dug around in the back of the garage, searching for the tent while Asuka watched from behind. For Asuka, the fact that shinji was searching for the tent had a certain finality towards there current living environment. They would be moving on.

打开车库的侧门，真嗣在车库后部翻找着，寻找那顶帐篷，而明日香则从后面看着。对明日香来说，真嗣寻找帐篷这一行为，似乎为当前的居住环境划上了一个句点。他们即将离开。

"Find it yet?" asked Asuka.

"找到了吗？" 明日香问道。

"I think so," replied Shinji, his voice coming from far back in the garage. Why they placed it so far back in a corner, Shinji didn't know.

“我想是的。” 真嗣的声音从车库深处传来。他不知道为什么他们要把那东西放在那么靠后的角落里。

Returning to Asuka, he was carrying the folded up tent on his shoulder, and the pegs required to fasten it to the ground.

回到明日香身边，他肩上扛着折叠好的帐篷，手里还拿着固定帐篷所需的钉子。

"Is this everything?" asked Asuka.

“东西都齐了吗？”明日香问道。

"From what I remember," nodded Shinji.

“就我记得的来说，”真嗣点头道。

Storing it in the back of the station wagon for now, they returned to the house, and more importantly, the warmth that was coming from the living room fire. It was almost the end of February, so spring was around the corner, but it was still cold out.

暂时将它存放在旅行车的后部，他们回到了屋内，更重要的是，回到了从客厅壁炉传来的温暖中。二月已近尾声，春天即将来临，但外面依然寒冷。

"Are you going to begin packing now?" asked Asuka.

“你现在要开始打包了吗？”明日香问道。

"No, I'll do that tonight I suppose," shrugged Shinji. He wasn't putting it off, as he knew they'd be leaving eventually, but he didn't feel like it now that he was in the midst of it.

“不，我想今晚再做吧，”真嗣耸了耸肩。他并非在拖延，因为他知道他们终究要离开，只是此刻他并不想动手。

"What about yourself?" "你自己呢？"

"Same, I guess," said Asuka as she shifted her position, getting more comfortable on the couch.

"差不多吧，" 明日香说着调整了一下姿势，让自己在沙发上更舒服些。"

They sank into their daily routine as they were want to do and let the day go by slowly until dinner approached. They still had plenty of food within the house, and even more was still in the grocery store they frequented. When they left, they agreed that they would stock up on as many supplies as possible. They were unsure how long it would take them to find a new home, so until then, they wanted enough food to live on. Be that as it may, Shinji wasn't stingy on dinner that night, and cooked a large dinner, which could very well be the last dinner they would have in that house.

他们像往常一样陷入了日常的例行公事，慢慢地让时间流逝，直到晚餐时间临近。家里还有不少食物，而且他们常去的杂货店里还有更多存货。离开时，他们约定尽可能多地储备物资。他们不确定找到新家需要多长时间，所以在那之前，他们希望有足够的食物维持生活。尽管如此，真嗣那晚并没有在晚餐上吝啬，他做了一顿丰盛的晚餐，这很可能是他们在那个房子里的最后一顿晚餐。

They were silent as the ate, both deep within their own thoughts. Whether it was remembering the past two an a half months that they spent in Tokyo-2, and the significant moments that they had shared together, both of them were conjuring up memories from those times.

他们吃饭时沉默不语，各自沉浸在自己的思绪中。无论是回忆过去两个半月在东京-2 度过的时光，还是共同经历的重要时刻，两人都在脑海中重温那些记忆。

After dinner, Shinji washed the dishes with help from Asuka. Night had already fallen at this point, and he had decided that now was as good a time as any to begin packing. Though he mentioned this to Asuka, he was surprised to hear her sigh and agree to this sentiment. Apparently, she had made the conscious decision to begin as well.

晚餐后，真嗣在明日香的协助下洗了碗。此时夜幕已经降临，他决定现在正是开始打包的好时机。虽然他向明日香提起了这件事，但听到她叹气并同意这一想法时，他感到有些意外。显然，她也做出了开始收拾的决定。

Marching up stairs, they began going through their respective rooms and sorting through everything they had collected. The backpacks and sleeping bags were a given, these which they had carried all the way from Tokyo-3 to Tokyo-2, and now beyond. Besides these, they found many other things that they had kept. The plastic utensils seemed pointless now, since they had actual silverware now, so they neglected to bring these along. Whenever one person found something else that they had forgotten about, they would tell the other person. It was this that brought Asuka into Shinji's room in the middle of packing.

他们拾级而上，开始逐一检查各自的房间，整理一路上收集的物品。背包和睡袋自不必说，这些从东京-3 一路带到东京-2，如今已超越了那段旅程。除此之外，他们还发现了不少珍藏之物。塑料餐具如今显得多余，毕竟他们已有了真正的银器，便未再携带。每当有人找到遗忘之物，总会告知对方。正是这一过程，让明日香在整理中途踏入了真嗣的房间。

"Almost done?" asked Asuka as she leaned against the doorframe, slightly startling Shinji who had been focusing on what he was doing.

"快好了吗？" 明日香靠在门框上问道，稍微吓了专注于手头事情的真嗣一跳。

"Doesn't feel like it," he replied. "Granted, you probably have more things than I do to begin with."

"感觉不像，" 他回答道。"当然，你一开始可能就比我多了不少东西。"

"True," shrugged Asuka. "确实，" 明日香耸了耸肩。

Walking further into Shinji's room, she sat down on his bed beside him, which was strewn with clothes and objects he had picked up during their travel.

她继续走进真嗣的房间，坐在他床边，床上散落着他们在旅途中捡拾的衣服和物品。

"What's up?" asked Shinji.

“怎么了？”真嗣问道。

"I found something while I was going through some of my dresser drawers."

“我在翻抽屉的时候发现了一些东西。”

Handing it to him, Shinji immediately recognized the piece of paper they had found while at the capital building back in December. It was the information they had found with relevance to when Tokyo-3 was destroyed, and Third Impact likely manifested.

递给他那张纸，真嗣立刻认出这是去年十二月在首都大楼找到的那份文件。上面记录着与第三新东京市毁灭及第三次冲击可能发生时间相关的信息。

"I hadn't thought about that in a long time," said Shinji as he glanced at the paper.

"我已经很久没有想过这件事了，" 真嗣瞥了一眼那张纸说道。

"Not only that-" 不仅如此——

As Asuka said this, she revealed something else which was even further from Shinji's mind. It was the handgun that Asuka had taken from the security checkpoint. It hadn't been fired once, except during that time in the park when Asuka was testing it.

当明日香这么说时，她又透露了另一件事，这件事离真嗣的思绪更远。那是明日香从安检处拿走的手枪。除了在公园里明日香试射的那次，它从未被开过火。

"I didn't know you kept it," said Shinji.

“我不知道你还留着它，”真嗣说。

"I kept a lot of things out of habit," said Asuka. "Though this was something which I was surprised I see again."

“我习惯性地保留了很多东西，”明日香说，“尽管这件东西再次出现让我感到意外。”

"Kinda makes it pointless now with my AT-field however."

"现在有了我的 AT 力场，这变得毫无意义了。"

Asuka glanced at him as he said this. Though Shinji had come to terms with his AT-field, he very rarely brought up the subject. He didn't have a problem with it like he used to, and neither was it a touchy subject anymore. It was something that just existed that he had come to terms with.

听到这话，明日香瞥了他一眼。虽然真嗣已经接受了他的 AT 力场，但他很少提起这个话题。他不再像以前那样对此感到困扰，也不再是一个敏感话题。这只是他接受的一个存在。

"Should I throw it away," asked Asuka.

"我应该扔掉它吗？" 明日香问道。

Shinji took several seconds to reply, seeming to think about it, before finally reaching a decision.

真嗣花了好几秒才回答，似乎在思考，最后终于做出了决定。

"No, keep it." “不，留着吧。”

This statement surprised Asuka. As Shinji had said, it was pointless considering what he could accomplish with his AT-field.

这句话让明日香感到惊讶。正如真嗣所说，考虑到他能用 AT 力场做到的事情，这确实毫无意义。

"What made you decide that?"

是什么让你做出这个决定的？

"Precaution I suppose," said Shinji. "In case I'm not there, I want you to be able to defend yourself. Besides, I don't know how to use it in the first place."

"我想是预防措施吧，" 真嗣说道。"万一我不在，我希望你能保护自己。再说了，我本来也不知道怎么用它。"

"I don't think anything is going to happen in the first place, and I can take care of myself," replied Asuka.

"我觉得一开始就不会发生什么事，而且我能照顾好自己，" 明日香回答道。"

While she said this, she didn't mention to Shinji how touched she was that he didn't want anything to happen to her. He hadn't had any visions in a while, not since December, and they spent every waking moment together, so it wasn't as though they were ever apart. But still...

虽然她这么说，但她并没有告诉真嗣，他不想让她受到任何伤害的这份心意让她多么感动。他已经有一段时间没有预知梦了，自从去年十二月开始就没有过，而且他们每时每刻都在一起，所以并不像是会分开的样子。但即便如此...

"I'd still feel better about it if you kept it," said Shinji.

"如果你拿着，我会感觉好些。" 真嗣说道。

"If you say so," replied Asuka.

"既然你这么说，" 明日香回答道。

After this, Asuka retuned to her room and continued packing, though it wasn't long until she returned to Shinji's room.

之后，明日香回到自己的房间继续收拾行李，但没过多久又回到了真嗣的房间。

"Find something else," asked shinji.

"找点别的吧," 真嗣问道。

"No, I just feel like calling it quits for the night so I'm going to bed."

"不了，我只是觉得今晚想放弃了，所以我要去睡觉了。"

"Oh," replied Shinji, unsure what he should say at such a declaration. Though they had slept in the same bed the previous night, there was nothing to expect that the same would follow tonight. Still, the way that Asuka had said it almost sounded as though she expected something.

"哦，" 真嗣回答道，不确定在这种宣告下他该说些什么。虽然他们前一晚睡在同一张床上，但并没有什么可以期待今晚也会如此。然而，明日香说这话的方式几乎让人觉得她期待着什么。

After staring at each other for several seconds, Shinji spoke.

在对视了几秒钟后，真嗣开口了。

"Did you want-" “你是不是想——”

Before he could get any further however, Asuka cut him off.

然而，他还没能继续说下去，就被明日香打断了。

"I'll leave that up to you."

"这由你决定。"

Without saying anything else, Asuka left his room, leaving Shinji to stare blankly at his doorway.

没有多说什么，明日香离开了他的房间，留下真嗣茫然地盯着门口。

Turning his gaze, he instead looked at the pile of things that were stacked on his bed that was visible in the candlelight. Well, he didn't really want to just dump everything on the floor, and neither did he want to continue packing. That seemed to leave him only one option.

他转过视线，目光落在烛光中映出的床上那堆杂物上。好吧，他并不想直接把所有东西都扔到地上，也不愿继续打包。这似乎只给他留下了一个选择。

Standing up, he left his own room and entered Asuka's. Her door had been left ajar, so all that he had to do was push it open lightly. It was like she was inviting him in, without voicing it.

他站起身，离开自己的房间，走进明日香的房间。她的门半掩着，他只需轻轻一推便能进入。仿佛她在无声地邀请他进来。

The candle within her room had just been blown out, and without any moonlight, Shinji had to be careful as he walked around the objects strewn across the floor. Whether they had previously been on the bed, or always on the floor since she had begun packing, Shinji didn't know.

她房间里的蜡烛刚被吹灭，没有月光，真嗣不得不小心翼翼地绕过散落在地板上的物品。这些物品之前是在床上，还是自从她开始打包就一直放在地板上，真嗣并不清楚。

As he neared her bed, and with his eyes fully adjusted to the darkness, he could see the outline of her body already tucked under the covers. This wasn't the first time that Shinji had entered her bed after she had already gotten in it, and it probably wouldn't be the last. Even so, he always felt a little weird going about it in this manner.

当他走近她的床边，眼睛已经完全适应了黑暗，他能看到她已经裹在被子下的身体轮廓。这不是真嗣第一次在她已经上床后才进入她的床，可能也不会是最后一次。即便如此，他总是觉得以这种方式行事有点奇怪。

Carefully, he removed the covers from one side of the bed, and then got in, rolling around so that he was turned away from Asuka.

他小心翼翼地从床的一侧掀开被子，然后钻了进去，翻了个身，背对着明日香。

"I see you decided," came Asuka's quiet voice beside him.

"看来你已经决定了，" 明日香在他身旁轻声说道。

Shinji wasn't surprised to hear her, as it was unlikely that she could have fallen asleep that quickly since they had last spoken.

真嗣并不惊讶听到她的声音，毕竟他们刚刚才交谈过，她不太可能这么快就睡着。

Rolling around towards her, Asuka had already turned to face him, a slight smirk on her face.

翻身面向她，明日香已经转过身来面对着他，脸上带着一丝得意的微笑。

"What?" asked Shinji, seeing the expression on her face.

"什么？" 真嗣问道，看到她脸上的表情。

"Nothing," said Asuka. "It's just, you're too predictable sometimes."

"没什么，" 明日香说。"只是，有时候你太好猜了。

"Or you've just known me for a while now."

"或者你已经认识我一段时间了。"

"Well, there's that," agreed Asuka.

"嗯，确实如此，"明日香同意道。

"So are you going to finish packing tomorrow?"

"那你明天会打包完吗？"

"Most likely, though I don't know about leaving tomorrow. It still seems too soon."

"很可能，不过我不确定明天是否离开。还是觉得太快了。"

"How much longer do you want to wait?"

"还要等多久？"

"I don't know," shrugged Asuka. "How long until we find another house like this?"

"我不知道，" 明日香耸了耸肩。"我们什么时候才能找到像这样的房子？"

"With luck, not long." "但愿不久。"

"You're awfully optimistic."

"你真是出奇地乐观。"

"More like looking forward to the future."

"更像是期待未来。"

"The future...huh," mumbled Asuka.

"未来啊...哼，"明日香喃喃道。"

The future was ambiguous, even though it was certain the future included both of them. Still, where they lived, what they would do, how long they stayed there were all things that were part of the future. They were still incredibly young, and had possibly seventy years left before they died. Asuka had difficulties putting that number into perspective, as she wasn't even sure what the next few days would bring.

未来是模糊的，尽管可以肯定未来会包含他们两人。然而，他们将居住的地方、将从事的工作、将停留的时间，这些都是未来的组成部分。他们还非常年轻，可能还有七十年的寿命。明日香难以将这个数字具体化，因为她甚至不确定接下来几天会发生什么。

"I can't even imagine what will happen in the future," Asuka finally said.

“我甚至无法想象未来会发生什么，”明日香终于说道。

Well maybe that wasn't entirely true, she thought, as she looked at Shinji.

嗯，也许这并不完全正确，她想，当她看着真嗣时。

"I suppose you have a point," said Shinji. "Everybody that is missing could suddenly come back after all."

“我想你说的有道理，”真嗣说，“失踪的每个人毕竟都有可能突然回来。”

Asuka hadn't even thought about that possibly. It seemed a given that they were the only people on earth at this point. Then again, Japan was a tiny island compared to the main continents. But say they did meet other humans, what would happen? Whether or not that was for the best, Asuka wasn't sure. As things were, she was fine with.

明日香甚至从未考虑过这种可能性。在这个时刻，他们似乎理所当然地认为自己是地球上仅存的人类。不过话说回来，与主要大陆相比，日本只是一个微小的岛屿。但假设他们真的遇到了其他人类，会发生什么呢？这是否是最好的结果，明日香并不确定。就目前的情况而言，她觉得这样挺好。

"Maybe, but I'm not worried about that. If people come back, then they do. If not, then we'll continue on anyway. Now, enough talking. I'm tired and wanna go to bed."

“也许吧，但我并不担心这个。如果人们回来，那就回来吧。如果不回来，我们照样继续前行。好了，别再说了。我累了，想睡觉。”

"Fair enough," answered shinji.

“说得也是，”真嗣回答道。

Very rarely did they have full conversations like this while sleeping beside each other, so shinji was admittedly enjoying it. But Asuka was right; they did need to get to bed.

他们很少像这样在彼此身旁入睡时进行完整的对话，所以真嗣确实乐在其中。但明日香说得没错；他们的确需要上床睡觉了。

Turning away from him, Asuka adjusted her position and curled up further under the covers, enjoying the warmth from the many blankets. She was conscious of the body heat beside her as well of course. Sleep never came difficult while Shinji slept beside her, and though she wasn't about to tell him, she felt an added layer of comfort while he slept beside her.

明日香转过身去，调整了一下姿势，更深地蜷缩在被子下，享受着多层毯子带来的温暖。当然，她也能感受到身旁的体温。有真嗣在身边，她从不觉得入睡困难，尽管她不会告诉他，但他在身边时，她感到多了一层安心。

'I guess that in itself is another form of my feelings,' thought Asuka before she fell asleep.

“我想，这本身就是另一种形式的我的感情吧，”明日香在入睡之前这样想着。

They both rose bright and early the next morning, and Shinji was surprised that Asuka had risen the same time as himself. Course, she quickly kicked him out of the room so she could change. This was still a line which hadn't been crossed yet, and Shinji didn't think it would change anytime in the future. Walking into his own room, he changed out of his sweatpants, and into a pair of jeans.

第二天清晨，两人都早早地醒来了，真嗣惊讶地发现明日香也和他同一时间起床。当然，她很快就把他踢出了房间，以便自己换衣服。这条界限至今尚未被跨越，真嗣也不认为未来会有所改变。走进自己的房间，他换下了运动裤，穿上了一条牛仔裤。

Getting breakfast ready, he was halfway done when Asuka's footsteps entered the kitchen.

准备早餐时，他刚做到一半，明日香的脚步声就进入了厨房。

"Done yet?" she asked. "好了吗？" 她问道。

"Almost," he replied. "快了，" 他回答道。

Asuka sat wordlessly at the kitchen table while Shinji finished cooking. The possibility that today was the last day they would be in this house hung on both of their minds. So many memories had filled the days that they had spent here, so many that they would remember for a long time. Leaving it was something that they had decided back in December, in what now felt like a hasty decision. They had so much here already, that it felt stupid and meaningless to leave almost.

明日香默默地坐在厨房的桌子旁，看着真嗣做饭。今天可能是他们在这栋房子里的最后一天，这个念头萦绕在他们两人的心头。在这里度过的日子里，他们留下了太多回忆，太多值得长久铭记的瞬间。离开这里的决定是在去年十二月做出的，现在回想起来似乎有些仓促。他们在这里已经有了太多，离开几乎显得愚蠢而无意义。

Finishing the preparations, Shinji place the breakfast on the table, and sat down beside Asuka. For the amount of time it had taken him, the actual breakfast was lackluster in reality. Asuka assumed that he had been preoccupied, so she didn't mention anything but ate silently. Shinji on the other hand just stared wordlessly at his own plate, suddenly not feeling very hungry.

完成准备工作后，真嗣将早餐摆上桌，坐在明日香身旁。考虑到他所花费的时间，实际上的早餐显得平淡无奇。明日香猜想他可能心事重重，便没有提及，只是默默地吃着。而真嗣则一言不发地盯着面前的盘子，突然间没了什么食欲。

"You okay?" asked Asuka finally after several awkward minutes.

"你还好吗？"在几分钟后，终于，明日香问道。

"I don't know," mumbled Shinji. His eyes had now wandered to the ceiling, apparently lost in thought. "Are we making the right decision in leaving this place? Everything we need is close enough that we don't have to worry about running out of food or any other essential things. What is the reason that we are even leaving here in the first place? It's not like what we have is bad by any means, considering the situation we're in."

"我不知道，" 真嗣咕哝着。他的目光已经游离到了天花板上，显然陷入了沉思。"我们离开这个地方是正确的决定吗？我们所需要的一切都近在咫尺，不必担心食物或其他必需品会耗尽。我们究竟为什么要离开这里？考虑到我们的处境，这里并不算糟糕。"

"Would you be happier to just stay here then?" asked Asuka.

"那你宁愿留在这里吗？" 明日香问道。

Tearing his gaze away from the ceiling, Shinji stared back at Asuka, but not quiet looking at her. His eyes seemed to be looking through her.

真嗣从天花板上收回目光，盯着明日香，但并没有真正看她。他的眼神似乎穿透了她。

"Yes and no...I think," Shinji eventually said. "This is easier, what we already have I mean. I can't even begin to count the amount of time spent until we've reached this place and moment. Life here just passes by blissfully and without difficulty. Okay, so some of the winter days were rough, but we got by and came out unscathed. All in all, I can't imagine a better place than what we have already."

"是也不是...我想，" 真嗣最终说道。"我们现在这样更容易，我是说我们已经拥有的。我甚至无法开始计算我们到达这个地方和这一刻所花费的时间。这里的生活只是幸福地、毫无困难地流逝。好吧，虽然有些冬日很艰难，但我们挺过来了，毫发无损。总的来说，我无法想象比我们现在拥有的更好的地方。"

"Then what do you mean by 'no?'" wondered Asuka, tilting her head towards the side.

"那你说的'不'是什么意思？" 明日香侧头疑惑道。

Shinji wasn't sure how to put that part of his thoughts into words. If he was honest, he couldn't remember ever being happier than he was right now, and the previous months that he had spent here with Asuka. So much of it had to do with his time spent here with her, that moving away from this seemed a scary thought. At the same time however, living somewhere quaint and peaceful, out in the country perhaps, had an altogether different feeling to it. No cityscape in the background; no lines of houses, all similarly constructed to mar the scenery. Just him and Asuka in a quiet home somewhere. That image lodged in Shinji's mind, and wouldn't go away.

真嗣不确定如何将这部分想法用言语表达出来。如果他诚实地说，他记不起有比现在更快乐的时候了，以及和明日香在这里度过的前几个月。这一切很大程度上与他在这里和她共度的时光有关，因此离开这里似乎是一个可怕的想法。然而与此同时，生活在某个宁静祥和的乡村，也许会有一种完全不同的感觉。没有城市景观作为背景；没有一排排相似建造的房屋破坏风景。只有他和明日香在一个安静的家中。那个画面萦绕在真嗣的脑海中，挥之不去。

Still though, he wasn't sure how to express this to Asuka.

尽管如此，他还是不确定该如何向明日香表达这一点。

"Well, I can sorta understand what you're getting at I think," said Asuka, in reply to Shinji's silence.

“嗯，我想我能大致理解你的意思，”明日香回答了真嗣的沉默。

"You do?" “你真的懂吗？”

"Somehow, this doesn't quite fit right I suppose, or maybe we don't fit properly here. With more people, it may be different, but that isn't going to happen. An entire lifeless city, and we're the only people in it; that doesn't exactly paint a very happy picture. True, we have more than enough food here to probably last us a lifetime, but I'd be lying if I don't feel lonely sometimes, driving around the city which once used to be one of the busiest cities in Japan. Maybe, in an area that was less populated, or something..."

不知为何，这里总感觉不太对劲，或许是我们与这里格格不入。如果有更多人，情况可能不同，但那不会发生。整座死寂的城市里，只有我们两人；这画面实在难以让人感到快乐。确实，这里有足够的食物，或许能供我们度过余生，但若说我从未感到孤独，那是在撒谎。驾车穿梭于这座曾经日本最繁忙的城市之一，有时难免心生寂寥。或许，在一个人烟更为稀少的地方，会好一些……

Asuka let her words end there, unsure what she was getting at, but Shinji seemed to understand. They were more or less on the same page afterall.

明日香说到这里便停了下来，不确定自己想表达什么，但真嗣似乎明白了。毕竟，他们或多或少心意相通。

"Is that it then?" asked Shinji.

"就这样了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"I suppose so," said Asuka as she stood up, carrying her half eaten breakfast to the kitchen. Shinji hadn't even touched his, and would likely be regretting that later, but he'd worry about that when the time comes.

"我想是的，" 明日香说着站起身，拿着她只吃了一半的早餐走向厨房。真嗣连碰都没碰他的那份，可能晚点会后悔，但他打算到时候再担心。

"Now all thats left is to finish packing I guess."

"现在剩下的就是打包了吧，我想。"

"True," said Shinji. “确实，”真嗣说。

Though they had said they would finish packing today, it quickly became obvious that they had many more things left to take care of. Even with finishing packing away all their personal effects, the question of what else to take became apparent. Food was the number one priority, as they were unsure how long they would be on the road. Other than that, any of the dishes, utensils, and pots and pans were needed to be sorted and determine what would go, and what would stay. Though seemingly large at first glance, their station wagon quickly became crammed full of boxes that were filled with all sorts of items. The boxes they had gathered from the attic, dumping the christmas ornaments out, and filling them with things more important. It was strange that something so meaningful two months ago would seem so meaningless now that they were moving, and needed all the packing space they could find.

尽管他们说过今天会打包完，但很快就很明显，他们还有很多事情要处理。即使完成了所有个人物品的打包，其他还需要带什么的问题也变得明显起来。食物是首要任务，因为他们不确定会在路上多久。除此之外，所有的餐具、器皿和锅碗瓢盆都需要分类，决定哪些带走，哪些留下。虽然乍看之下似乎很大，但他们的旅行车很快就塞满了装满各种物品的箱子。他们从阁楼上收集的箱子，倒出了圣诞装饰品，填满了更重要的东西。两个月前如此有意义的东西，现在搬家时却显得如此无足轻重，他们需要尽可能多的打包空间。

Packing away the final box of kitchen supplies, Shinji walked into the garage and dumped one of many boxes that filled the back of the station wagon. Most of it was canned food or bottled water, but a good amount was other things that they had determine they needed. The last of the firewood was brought with them as well.

将最后一箱厨房用品打包好，真嗣走进车库，将一个装满后车厢的众多箱子之一扔了进去。其中大部分是罐头食品或瓶装水，但也有不少是他们认为必需的其他物品。最后一批木柴也一并带上了。

Walking back into the house, Shinji walked up the stairs and down the hallway, knocking on Asuka's door.

走回屋内，真嗣上了楼梯，穿过走廊，敲响了明日香的房门。

"It's fine, you can come in. I'm not really doing anything at the moment anyway."

“没事，你可以进来。反正我现在也没在忙什么。”

Shinji did so, and walked into Asuka's room. The room was significantly more empty compared to how it had been this morning, when half of Asuka's things had been strewn across the floor. It looked just as it had the first day they had decided to settle here.

真嗣照做了，走进明日香的房间。与今早相比，房间明显空旷了许多，那时明日香的东西还散落一地。现在看起来就像他们决定在这里安顿下来的第一天一样。

Asuka was sitting on her bed cross-legged. The sheets and blankets had been removed along with the pillows. Asuka had insisted that they bring some blankets and at least two pillows with them, saying that, 'if they would be living outside again for a while, they may as well be more comfortable than when they had initially come to Tokyo-2.'

明日香盘腿坐在床上。床单、被子和枕头都被撤走了。明日香坚持要他们带上一些毯子和至少两个枕头，她说：'既然他们又要在外面生活一段时间，那还不如比刚来东京-2 时更舒服些。'

"Got everything you need?" asked Shinji.

“东西都带齐了吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah, just spending sometime sitting here, reminiscing about some stuff. You ready?"

“嗯，只是坐在这里，回忆一些事情。你准备好了吗？”

"Whenever you are," nodded Shinji.

“随时都行，”真嗣点头道。

"Right," said Asuka. “好的，”明日香说。

Springing upward, she bounded off her bed and glanced one final time around her room. She had slept in here for about three months, and would probably be missing this room come tonight. It had been her own place within the house where she went incase something troubled her, but no longer would it serve that purpose.

她一跃而起，从床上跳下，最后一次环顾自己的房间。她在这里住了大约三个月，今晚可能会想念这个房间。这是她在房子里的私人空间，每当有什么事情困扰她时，她就会来这里，但今后它不再有这个作用了。

"Lets go," said Asuka as she turned away from her room.

“走吧，”明日香说着，转身离开了她的房间。

They both walked down the stairs, Asuka in front of Shinji. Their gazes passed over the dinning room briefly, remembering the meals they had shared together. Everything they had done was together, so their memories were synced up in that regard. Rounding the corner towards the front door, they stood side by side, looking into the living room. This was certainly the room they had spent the most time in, with the fire roaring in front of them, and both of them seated on opposite ends of the couch. From the initial time they moved in, to Christmas, to this moment now, many memories were wound up within this room.

他们一起走下楼梯，明日香走在真嗣前面。他们的目光短暂地掠过餐厅，回忆起一起共进的那一顿顿餐食。他们所做的一切都是在一起的，因此在这方面，他们的记忆是同步的。绕过拐角走向前门，他们并肩而立，望向客厅。这无疑是他们花费最多时间的房间，壁炉前的火焰熊熊燃烧，两人分别坐在沙发的两端。从最初搬进来到圣诞节，再到此刻，许多回忆都缠绕在这个房间里。

Placing a hand on Asuka's shoulder, Shinji gestured that they should leave. Asuka nodded slowly, realizing that if they spent to much time in this room, they may have second thoughts about this decision.

真嗣把手放在明日香的肩上，示意他们该离开了。明日香缓缓点头，意识到如果在这个房间里逗留太久，他们可能会对这个决定产生犹豫。

Walking into the garage, they got into their respective seats, Asuka in the driver seat, and Shinji in the passenger. Wordlessly, Asuka started the car, and threw it into reverse, backing out of the driveway. She paused briefly on the driveway, allowing both of them to look up at the place they had called home for three months. If they wanted to, they could still stay here. All they would have to do would be to drive the car forward again, and retract everything that they had done the past two days. But this decision had been coming on for a while.

走进车库，他们各自落座，明日香坐上驾驶位，而真嗣则坐在副驾驶。明日香一言不发地启动了汽车，猛地挂入倒挡，驶离了车道。她在车道上短暂停留，让两人得以抬头望向这个他们称之为家的地方，三个月来他们一直住在这里。如果愿意，他们本可以留下。只需将车向前开回，撤回过去两天所做的一切。但这个决定已经酝酿许久。

"This is okay...right?" asked Asuka.

"这样...可以吧？" 明日香问道。

"Yeah, it is," said Shinji.

“是啊，确实如此。”真嗣说道。

Taking her foot off the brake, Asuka finished backing out of the driveway, and then shifted into first gear, before kicking it up to second. Driving down the street, they both looked at the house until they rounded the corner and it disappeared from their sight. Afterwards, they never looked back, nor spoke a word to each other until hours later.

明日香松开刹车，完成了从车道上的倒车，然后换到一档，接着迅速升至二档。他们沿着街道行驶，目光一直停留在那座房子上，直到转过街角，房子从视线中消失。之后，他们再也没有回头，也没有对彼此说一句话，直到几个小时后。

They had the map of course, so it wasn't as though they were clueless in knowing where they were going. About an hour outside of Tokyo-2, and with the city, house, and ocean behind them, they finally pulled to a stop off the main interstate road. Driving was slow, as they had to continually navigate around the cars that had been parked in the middle of the road. Several cars had been flipped on there side, or had one side caved in. The people who had been driving them had disappeared during Third Impact, leaving their cars to come to a stop at whatever they hit at 55mph.

当然，他们有地图，所以并非对目的地一无所知。大约在东京-2 城外一小时车程的地方，随着城市、房屋和海洋被抛在身后，他们终于在主干道旁停了下来。由于不得不不断绕过停在路中间的车辆，行驶速度很慢。许多车辆被侧翻或一侧严重凹陷。这些车辆的主人在第三次冲击中消失了，留下他们的车以 55 英里每小时的速度撞上任何它们碰到的东西。

With Second Impact, and the rising of the oceans, most of the coastal cities in Japan had gone underwater, with the exception of Tokyo-2 and Tokyo-3. Even so, most of mainland Japan had migrated to these two cities that were natural hubs of commercial business. Before Third Impact even, whole cities within mainland Japan already had there populations slashed, creating something similar to a ghost town. On the interstate of course, it wasn't uncommon to see signs pointing off in different directions towards small towns. It was one of these off-ramps that Shinji and Asuka took. They didn't drive far from the road, and kept it within sight, but found a nice section off the shoulder where they could step out and walk down into a small field.

第二次冲击与海平面上升后，日本多数沿海城市已沉入水下，唯有第二东京与第三东京幸免于难。即便如此，日本本土的大部分人口已迁至这两座天然商业中心。甚至在第三次冲击之前，日本本土的许多城市人口已大幅减少，宛如鬼城。在州际公路上，不时可见指向不同方向、通往小镇的路标。碇真嗣和明日香便驶入了其中一条匝道。他们并未远离公路，始终保持可见，却找到了一处宜人的路肩，可以走下小径，步入一片田野。

The sun was already setting, and they began slowly making camp, but neither really felt like setting up the tent, only to break it down the next morning.

太阳已经西沉，他们开始缓缓搭建营地，但两人都不太想搭起帐篷，只为第二天早上再拆掉。

They ate a makeshift dinner, neither feeling very hungry, but Shinji made a point to eat at least more than he had at breakfast. Afterwards, they sat beside each other, while the warmth of the fire danced in front of their eyes, casting shadows on the ground beside them. They had enough firewood to last several more days, but afterwards, it would be a different story. Granted, and Shinji and considered this already, it wouldn't be difficult to get more, considering what he was able to accomplish with his AT-field. He had a feeling it was never meant to do menial tasks like that, but it was fast and efficient.

他们吃了顿简便的晚餐，两人都不怎么饿，但真嗣还是特意吃了比早餐多一些。饭后，他们并肩而坐，火光在眼前跳跃，将影子投射在旁边的地面上。他们备足了能维持几天的柴火，但之后就得另想办法了。当然，真嗣已经考虑过这一点，凭借他的 AT 力场，获取更多柴火并不难。他有种感觉，这能力本不该用来做这些琐事，但它的确快速又高效。

As night set in, and the cicadas came out, Shinji and Asuka realized how much there environment had changed in such a short time. Even though the common noises within cities didn't exist anymore, because of Third Impact, nature hadn't begun to take over the monuments to human civilization yet. They had spent so long in Tokyo-2 that they had nearly forgotten what lived on the outside. They had seen several domesticated animals during their time in Tokyo-2, but outside of the city, the noises of nature were all around them.

夜幕降临，蝉鸣四起，真嗣和明日香意识到他们的环境在如此短的时间内发生了多大的变化。尽管因为第三次冲击，城市中的常见噪音已不复存在，但自然尚未开始接管人类文明的纪念碑。他们在东京-2 生活了太久，几乎忘记了外界的生物。在东京-2 期间，他们见过一些家养动物，但在城市之外，大自然的喧嚣环绕着他们。

Shivering slightly, Asuka suddenly stood up, and moved away from the fire. Though she didn't say anything, Shinji understood this to mean she was tired, and wanted to fall asleep. Standing up, he stomped the fire out, and followed her up the sloped hill to their car. Asuka had already opened one of the backdoors, and had crawled into the back, pushing the boxes away from her so she could have enough room to sleep. As Shinji reached the car however, and motioned to sleep in the passenger seat up front, Asuka placed a hand on his shoulder from the backseat. Shinji took one look into her eyes and knew what she wanted to say, without actually saying it.

明日香微微颤抖着，突然站起身，远离了火堆。尽管她什么也没说，真嗣明白这意味着她累了，想睡觉。他站起来，踩灭火焰，跟着她爬上斜坡，走向他们的车。明日香已经打开了一扇后门，爬进后座，把箱子推开，以便有足够的空间睡觉。然而，当真嗣走到车旁，打算在前排乘客座位上睡觉时，明日香从后座伸出手放在他的肩膀上。真嗣看了一眼她的眼睛，就知道她想说什么，尽管她没有说出口。

Crawling over the passenger seat, Shinji moved into the backseat where Asuka was. The boxes made it so crammed that there wasn't any hope of stretching out like his old bed so many miles away now. Grabbing the blankets and the two pillows, Shinji threw the blankets over themselves, and then passed one of the pillows to Asuka, before sinking onto his own.

爬过副驾驶座，真嗣挪到了后座，那里有明日香在。箱子使得空间异常拥挤，根本无法像远在数英里外的老床那样伸展。真嗣抓起毯子和两个枕头，将毯子盖在他们身上，然后递给明日香一个枕头，自己则靠在另一个上。

In the times they had slept together in their old home, there had been so much room in the bed that they could sleep on opposite sides if they wanted to; this was different, and Shinji was reminded of the times they slept in the tent when they first came to Tokyo-2.

在他们旧家的那些共眠时光里，床上的空间是如此宽敞，他们甚至可以选择睡在床的两端；而现在的情况截然不同，真嗣不禁回想起他们初到东京-2 时在帐篷里睡觉的日子。

"This is strange, sleeping like this I mean," spoke Asuka suddenly.

“这样睡觉，感觉很奇怪，”明日香突然说道。

"I know," mumbled Shinji.

"我知道，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"Remember when we first slept in here?"

"记得我们第一次在这里睡觉的时候吗？"

"Yeah, you forced me to sleep in the front seat and hogged the back all to yourself."

"是啊，你逼我睡在前座，自己却霸占了整个后座。"

Shinji could feel Asuka chuckle softly beside him as he said this.

碇真嗣能感觉到，当他说这话时，身旁的明日香轻轻地笑了一声。

"How things have changed since then."

"自那以后，一切都变了。"

"Yet we're back here where we started it feelings like."

"然而我们又回到了起点，感觉依旧。"

"In some areas maybe," muttered Asuka so quietly that Shinji couldn't hear her.

"在某些方面或许吧，" 明日香低声嘟囔，声音轻到真嗣都没听见。"

Conversation stopped for a time between them, and Shinji thought that Asuka had already fallen asleep and was quickly drifting off himself, when he felt the rustle of the blankets beside him shift. Asuka had changed positions, and instead of being turned away from him, now had her body pressed against his back, and her hands resting on his upper shoulders. Shinji wasn't oblivious to this situation, and could very easily feel the soft sensation of Asuka's breasts pressed against his back. He tried to push these thoughts away, but the warmth that was emanating off Asuka's body was impossible to ignore.

他们之间的对话暂时中断了，真嗣以为明日香已经睡着，自己也很快就要进入梦乡，这时他感觉到身边的毯子动了动。明日香换了姿势，不再是背对着他，而是身体紧贴着他的后背，双手搭在他的肩上。真嗣并非对此毫无察觉，他能清晰地感受到明日香柔软的胸部贴在自己背上的触感。他试图驱散这些念头，但明日香身体散发出的温暖却无法忽视。

"A-Asuka?" stuttered Shinji.

"A-明日香？" 真嗣结巴道。

"W-What? It's not like its very comfortable back here, so at the very least I want to be warm."

"什-什么？又不是说这里有多舒服，至少我想暖和点。"

Asuka was glad that Shinji couldn't see her face, because it had steadily begun to turn red. It wasn't just he that was aware afterall, as it was her body that was pressed against his.

明日香庆幸真嗣看不到她的脸，因为她的脸颊正逐渐泛红。毕竟，不仅仅是他在察觉，她的身体也紧贴着他。

"Maybe we should have brought more blankets," said Shinji.

"也许我们应该多带几条毯子。" 真嗣说道。

"Too late for that," replied Asuka. "Besides...this works well enough as any blanket would."

"太晚了，" 明日香回答道。"再说...这和任何毯子一样管用。"

Her voice got steadily quieter as she finished her sentence until it almost became a whisper.

她的话语声逐渐变小，直到几乎成了耳语。

"How long do you think we'll continue like this Shinji?"

"你觉得我们还会这样继续多久，真嗣？"

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Will we ever stay in one place for long, or will we move every few months."

"我们是否能长久地停留在一个地方，还是会每隔几个月就搬家呢？"

"What do you want?" "你想要什么？"

"I'd like to stay in one place eventually."

"我希望最终能在一个地方安定下来。"

"Like settling down?" “像是要安定下来？”

Silence greeted Shinji's comment for several seconds, until Asuka eventually replied, "That's one way to look at it I suppose. Settling down has a strange sound to it though, sorta of like-"

沉默回应了真嗣的评论，几秒钟后，明日香终于回答道：“我想这是一种看法吧。安定下来这个词听起来有点奇怪，有点像——”

Asuka caught herself, as she was about to say something utterly ridiculous. Whether Shinji clued in to what she had been about to say, he didn't say anything in that regard.

明日香及时打住，差点说出极其荒谬的话。真嗣是否察觉到她原本要说什么，他没有对此发表任何意见。

"Maybe the next place we stay will be that place."

"也许我们下次停留的地方就是那个地方。"

"Maybe," said Asuka, her voice muffled as her head was pressed against Shinji's back.

"也许吧，" 明日香说道，她的声音因为头靠在真嗣背上而显得有些模糊。

Whatever the future held for them was uncertain. They lived in a world which was seemingly devoid of other human life in which they only had each other. Material things hardly mattered to them, as most things they acquired would likely be discarded at some point. Even a home, which they had had until just today, was now behind them. Would another house really make any difference in the grand scheme of things? Would they continue to just move from one place to another, or finally find a place to stay?

无论未来对他们意味着什么，都是未知的。他们生活在一个看似缺乏其他人迹的世界里，只有彼此相伴。物质的东西对他们来说几乎无关紧要，因为他们获得的大多数物品最终都可能被丢弃。就连他们直到今天还拥有的家，现在也已抛在身后。在宏大的生命蓝图中，另一个房子真的会有所不同吗？他们会继续从一个地方漂泊到另一个地方，还是最终找到一个安身之所？

Either way, they had an entire lifetime ahead of them, and were still young afterall. Only time would tell.

无论如何，他们还有整整一生的时间，毕竟仍然年轻。唯有时间能给出答案。

### Chapter 20: Sensations

Alright, here we go! Second chapter as promised. These two chapters are actually kinda weird, in that the first one was mostly written back in April, and this one was just written over the past two weeks. Anyways, as it will be apparent after reading this, there is going to be a change beginning to happen between Asuka and Shinji, but I'll talk more at the end of this chapter. Enjoy!

好了，我们开始吧！如约而至的第二篇 chapter。这两章其实有点奇怪，第一章大部分是四月份写的，而这篇则是过去两周内完成的。无论如何，读完这篇后会明显感觉到，碇真嗣和明日香之间即将发生一些变化，不过我会在 chapter 的结尾再详细讨论。尽情享受吧！

---

When Shinji first awoke that next morning, he realized that he was in a bit of a predicament. Whenever he slept next to Asuka, when they had been living in their house together in Tokyo-2, he was always considerate about not waking her as he got out of bed. This was never a problem normally, since they usually slept on opposite sides of the bed for the most part, so he never worried that much about accidentally waking her. This was different of course.

第二天早上，真嗣醒来时，意识到自己陷入了一个小困境。每当他和明日香一起住在东京-2 的家里时，他总是小心翼翼地起床，以免吵醒她。这通常不是问题，因为他们大部分时间都睡在床的两边，所以他不太担心会不小心吵醒她。但这次情况不同。

Even when he had been sleeping, you couldn't call it very peaceful. After having slept on a mattress for nearly three months, the backseat of the car was anything but comfortable. Several times he had woken up during that night, and had taken several minutes before he had been able to fall asleep again. The hard surface of the backseat dug into his back, and there was little to no room for him toss and turn. The boxes they had brought with them were pushed against the side and stacked on top of each other at his feet, but of course there was somebody sleeping beside him as well. Though they didn't talk to each other after they had initially fallen asleep that night, Shinji knew that more than once, they had both woken up that night at some point.

即便在他睡着的时候，也很难称之为安宁。在床垫上睡了近三个月后，车子的后座简直谈不上舒适。那一夜他多次醒来，每次都需要好几分钟才能再次入睡。坚硬的后座表面硌得他背部生疼，几乎没有空间让他翻身。他们带来的箱子被推到一边，堆叠在他的脚边，当然，还有人在他旁边睡觉。尽管那晚他们一开始睡着后就没再交谈，但真嗣知道，不止一次，他们俩都在夜里某个时刻醒了过来。

Either way, when he finally opened his eyes after a restless sleep, he couldn't do much except lay there. The soft breathing from the girl laying next to kept him aware of this, but even Shinji wished that he could at least get out from under the blankets.

无论如何，当他终于在一次不安稳的睡眠后睁开眼睛时，除了躺在那里，他什么也做不了。身旁女孩轻柔的呼吸声让他意识到这一点，但就连真嗣也希望自己至少能从毯子下钻出来。

After sometime though, and Shinji wasn't sure whether he had a hand in it, Asuka did eventually wake up, though apparently not in the greatest mood.

过了一段时间，虽然真嗣不确定自己是否起了作用，但明日香最终还是醒了，尽管看起来心情并不太好。

"What time is it," her voiced eventually groaned next to him.

"几点了？" 她的声音最终在他身旁呻吟道。

"Not much longer till sunrise," replied Shinji. From where he was laying, he could see glimpses of the sun on the horizon.

"离日出不远了，" 真嗣回答。他躺着的地方，可以看到地平线上太阳的些许光芒。

"I may not want to sleep like this again."

"我可能再也不想这样睡了。"

"You just aren't used to it yet."

"你只是还不习惯而已。"

"I meant having two people sleep in the backseat," replied Asuka, her voice rather harsh.

"我的意思是，后座要睡两个人，" 明日香回答道，她的声音相当严厉。"

Shinji wasn't sure whether she meant this or not, so he decided to simply not reply.

真嗣不确定她是否真的这么想，所以他决定干脆不回应。

Slowly, Asuka sat up, the blanket falling around her. Her hair was a disheveled mess, and her eyes had bags under them that weren't there the previous morning. It was amazing how differently a change in their environment could affect her.

慢慢地，明日香坐起身来，毯子滑落在她周围。她的头发凌乱不堪，眼睛下方出现了前一天早上还没有的黑眼圈。环境的变化竟然能对她产生如此不同的影响，真是令人惊讶。

She sat like that for several minutes, before untangling herself from the rest of the blankets, and then crawled out of the car. Shinji followed slowly after her, enjoying that change in air when he left the car. It had been far to stuffy in there, and he'd have to remember to roll down the windows before they slept again.

她就这样坐了几分钟，然后从毯子中挣脱出来，爬出了车外。真嗣慢慢地跟在她后面，享受着离开车后空气的变化。车里实在太闷了，他得记住下次睡觉前把窗户打开。

"Its too early, and I didn't get much sleep," grumbled Asuka, as she leaned against the car door. Glancing at Shinji though, she continued with, "You and me both from the look of things."

"太早了，我也没怎么睡好，" 明日香抱怨着，靠在车门上。瞥了一眼真嗣，她继续说道，"看样子你和我一样。"

Shinji supposed that he must look similar to Asuka in that regard.

真嗣猜想在这方面，自己看起来应该和明日香差不多。

"At least we have an early start," offered Shinji.

"至少我们出发得早，" 真嗣提议道。

"I'm the one driving," said Asuka as if that ended the conversation.

"我来开车，" 明日香说道，仿佛这样就结束了对话。

Shinji didn't reply, and decided that further conversation would be pointless unless they got something to eat.

真嗣没有回答，他觉得除非他们吃点东西，否则进一步的对话毫无意义。

He was right, as after breakfast, Asuka did wake up a little more, though she still looked tired.

他是对的，因为早餐后，明日香确实清醒了一些，尽管她看起来仍然很疲惫。

"So whats the plan today," she asked after they had finished eating.

“那今天有什么计划？”她吃完饭后问道。

"Continue on the highway I suppose," shrugged Shinji.

“我想，继续沿着高速公路走吧。”真嗣耸了耸肩。

"Not much of a plan," sighed Asuka as she fell back onto the grass. "This is far more comfortable than sleeping in that car. Uh, I almost feel like just sleeping here for a couple more hours."

“计划不怎么样，”明日香叹了口气，仰面躺倒在草地上。“这可比睡在车里舒服多了。呃，我几乎想在这里再睡几个小时。”

Though she said this, Asuka didn't want to linger around here for very long. Maybe it was because of the house they had left behind, but she wanted to find a new place as quickly as possible. The thought of having to spend many more nights living liked this irked her after being comfortable for so long.

尽管她这么说，明日香并不想在这里久留。或许是因为他们离开的那栋房子，但她迫切想尽快找到一个新地方。长时间舒适生活后，再这样过夜的想法让她感到烦躁。

"Well, I suppose we can't really do that though," said Asuka as she sat up.

“嗯，我想我们确实不能那样做，”明日香说着坐了起来。

Taking her meaning, Shinji stamped out the fire, and then followed her back to the car.

领会她的意思后，真嗣踩灭了火，随后跟着她回到了车上。

Pulling back onto the highway, they quickly encountered a problem which Shinji had been waiting for in some aspects. Whether humanity knew that Third Impact was upon them, or if it was just another work day of millions of people commuting to work, Shinji didn't know.

重新驶上高速公路，他们很快遇到了一个真嗣在某些方面一直在等待的问题。无论人类是否知道第三次冲击已经降临，或者这只是数百万上班族又一个平凡的工作日，真嗣并不清楚。

Though Tokyo-2 and Tokyo-3 were the major hubs of commercial business and residential dwellings in Japan, that wasn't to say that some people didn't prefer to live in a quieter, secluded place in the country. Even if they did however, in order to support a family, a job was still required. The highway they were on was the busiest highway connecting Tokyo-2 to inland Japan, and therefore, traffic was always a problem during rush hour. They had been lucky so far while driving, both from Tokyo-3 to Tokyo-2, and around Tokyo-2, but they had hit a roadblock, so to speak.

尽管东京-2 和东京-3 是日本主要的商业中心和住宅区，但这并不意味着没有人喜欢住在乡间更安静、隐蔽的地方。然而，为了养家糊口，工作仍是必需的。他们所在的高速公路是连接东京-2 与日本内陆最繁忙的通道，因此，在高峰时段交通总是个问题。到目前为止，他们在从东京-3 到东京-2 以及在东京-2 周边行驶时都很幸运，但他们现在可以说是遇到了交通堵塞。

After driving roughly twenty minutes from where they had camped, they came upon a traffic jam of cars. This wouldn't have been so bad if it was only one side of the highway, but both sides, and both lanes were packed with cars.

从他们露营的地方驱车大约二十分钟后，他们遇到了一长串停滞不前的车辆。如果只是高速公路的一侧堵塞，情况还不算太糟，但现在是两侧、双车道都挤满了车。

Slowing to a stop in front of a white sudan, they both stepped out of the car and assessed the situation. From what they could see, the traffic jam went on for a while, and over the next hill, so they couldn't accurately guess how long it would take to get around it. There was no shoulder on the side, so they couldn't drive around it all like they normally could, and doubling back to find a different route could take them hours.

在一辆白色苏丹车前缓缓停下，两人都下了车，评估着当前的状况。从他们所能看到的来看，交通堵塞似乎会持续一段时间，并且延伸到下一个山丘之后，因此他们无法准确估计需要多长时间才能绕过它。路边没有可供绕行的空间，所以他们无法像往常那样直接开过去，而折返寻找另一条路线可能会耗费他们数小时。

"How the hell do we get around this?" wondered Asuka. Her lack of sleep was starting to show.

“我们到底该怎么绕过这鬼东西？”明日香疑惑道。她的睡眠不足开始显现出来。

"We could always walk it," joked Shinji, but Asuka didn't find it very funny.

"我们完全可以走过去，" 真嗣开玩笑地说，但明日香并不觉得这有什么好笑的。

"What, and bring all the boxes and shit with us? How far do you think we'd have to walk before we started leaving stuff behind."

"什么，还要带着所有箱子和那些乱七八糟的东西？你觉得我们要走多远才会开始丢东西。"

"I was joking Asuka." "我刚才是开玩笑的，明日香。"

"And I didn't appreciate it. What are we going to do?"

"而且我并不欣赏这种状况。我们该怎么办？"

Shinji didn't immediately reply to her, but since he had seen the traffic jam, he had a pretty good idea what they only thing they could do was.

真嗣没有立即回答她，但由于他已经看到了交通堵塞，他对他们唯一能做的事情有了相当好的想法。

"Asuka, go ahead and get back in the car," he said.

"明日香，继续回到车里去吧，"" 他说。

"Why?" she asked, her gaze whipping over to him.

"为什么？" 她问道，目光迅速转向他。

"Do I really need to say?" replied Shinji.

"我真的需要说吗？" 真嗣回答道。

As he said this, Asuka saw the expression on his face change from one of laid backness, to fixed. It was then that she realized what he was talking about.

就在他说这话时，明日香看到他脸上的表情从悠闲转变为坚定。那一刻，她意识到他在谈论什么。

"Right, sorry," said Asuka, as she turned around.

"好的，抱歉，" 明日香说着转过身来。

"And back up a ways as well. I'm honestly not too sure how this is going to work, so I may need to practice a bit."

"还要再退后一些。老实说，我不太确定这会怎么运作，所以我可能需要练习一下。"

"Okay," nodded Asuka. All anger had gone out of her voice, and she suddenly seemed less tired now.

“好的，”明日香点头道。她的声音中怒气已消，此刻似乎也不那么疲惫了。

After Shinji was sure that she had gotten back in the car, and had backed away many feet, he turned to look at the cars. Many of them were already damaged, and had both their front and back bumpers smashed in from when the drivers suddenly vanished, and some had even been flipped on their side. Shinji wondered if he'd ever experience the frustration of sitting in long line of cars on a busy highway or freeway, but supposed that such things were likely impossible. Well, this was probably as close as it came anyway.

在确认明日香已经回到车内，并且自己已经后退了好几步之后，真嗣转身望向那些车辆。许多车已经受损，前后保险杠因驾驶员突然消失而撞得凹陷，甚至有些车被掀翻在侧。真嗣思索着自己是否还有机会体验在繁忙的高速公路或高速路上，坐在长长的车流中那种无奈的等待，但他觉得这种事情大概已不可能发生。嗯，这大概就是最接近那种情景的情况了吧。

Even though he tried not to think of it, ever since December, he was always conscious of it. He had hardly used it since then either, but it was still a part of him. His feelings on the subject were mixed now however, where at first he had loathed it, but now was unsure. At the very least, he could easily fix a problem like this, and if something else happened, well, he tried not to think too hard about 'what if' situations. He had this power, and could freely control it now, so that was something.

尽管他努力不去想这件事，但从十二月开始，它始终萦绕在他心头。自那以后，他几乎未曾动用过它，但它仍是自己的一部分。如今，他对这件事的感情变得复杂，起初他深恶痛绝，现在却感到迷茫。至少，像这样的问题他能轻易解决，至于其他情况，好吧，他尽量不去深究那些“万一”的设想。他拥有这份力量，现在也能自如地掌控它，这算是一点安慰。

Waving his arm in the air, he signaled to Asuka that he was about to start clearing the way. Her hands tensed slightly on the steering wheel, though she didn't know why. He would be fine, is all that was running through her head, but the concept of something happening to him still lingered.

他挥动手臂在空中，向明日香发出即将开始清理道路的信号。她的手微微紧握方向盘，尽管她也不明白为何如此。她脑海中只反复想着他会没事的，但关于他可能遭遇不测的念头仍挥之不去。

A flash of orange erupted around him, and at first Asuka looked away, afraid of what might happen, but quickly looked back. Shinji had projected his AT-field down the center of the two lanes, splitting the two in half. He still wasn't sure whether his AT-field had a limited range, but at the moment, he would do everything in sections. Carefully, he began applying force to the cars on one side of the lane, pushing them over the divider, and into the southbound lane of cars. He was careful as he did this, not wanting to crush the cars, but to simply apply enough force to push them off the road, almost like a bulldozers. After successfully doing this to one lane, he did it to the other. The other lane was on the right side of the road though, with a guardrail against it, and a slopping hill afterwards. Shinji didn't have much choice, and was forced to push the cars clear up against the guardrail, and then over it. The sound of metal screeching against metal filled his ears, and even Asuka who was still inside their car had to cover hers.

一团橙光在他周围爆发，起初明日香别过头去，害怕会发生什么，但很快又转了回来。真嗣将自己的 AT 力场沿着两条车道中央展开，将它们一分为二。他仍不确定自己的 AT 力场是否有范围限制，但此刻，他只能分段进行。小心翼翼地，他开始对车道一侧的车辆施加力量，将它们推过隔离带，挤入南行车道。他做得很谨慎，不想压坏车辆，只是施加足够的力量将它们推离路面，几乎像推土机一样。成功处理完一条车道后，他又转向另一条。然而另一条车道在道路右侧，旁边是护栏，再往后是一片斜坡。真嗣别无选择，只能将车辆推至护栏边，然后翻越过去。金属摩擦的刺耳声充斥着他的耳朵，就连仍在车内的明日香也不得不捂住自己的耳朵。

Slowly though, they began making progress, and began to push forward. Shinji learned how much force he could use, and began speeding up the process, walking down the center line as he pushed the cars out of his way, while Asuka drove at a distance behind him. Several times, he had to lift a car completely off the pavement with his AT-field, and then gently lower it onto the southbound lane. This continued for what felt like an hour, and Asuka at one point had to shout to get his attention, suggesting that they take a break. But Shinji wanted to get this over with as quickly as possible.

尽管如此，他们开始取得进展，并开始向前推进。真嗣学会了使用多大的力量，并开始加快进程，沿着中心线行走，将车辆推到一旁，而明日香则在远处驾车跟随。有好几次，他不得不使用 AT 力场将一辆车完全从路面上抬起，然后轻轻地放在南行车道上。这种情况持续了感觉像是一个小时，明日香有一次不得不大声喊叫以引起他的注意，建议他们休息一下。但真嗣想尽快完成这件事。

Soon though, they arrived to the top of the hill they had seen at the beginning of the traffic jam. From what they could see, a little further past where they currently were, the shoulder on the right side opened up, so once they got to that point, they could freely drive down it without any worries. Getting to that point would still take time however.

不久，他们到达了交通堵塞开始时看到的那座小山的山顶。从他们所见，再往前一点，右侧的路肩开阔起来，所以一旦到达那个点，他们就可以无忧无虑地沿着它自由行驶。然而，到达那个点仍然需要时间。

Again, Asuka suggested they take a break, and more importantly, Shinji needed a break. Though he had grown accustomed to his AT-field, he had never used it this much, and she could clearly see that it was slowly wearing him down. Again though, he rejected this idea, and continued on.

又一次，明日香建议他们休息一下，更重要的是，真嗣需要休息。尽管他已经习惯了使用 AT 力场，但他从未如此频繁地使用过，她可以清楚地看出这正慢慢消耗着他。然而，他再次拒绝了这一提议，继续前进。

It was tedious and laborious work, but Shinji planned on seeing it through to the end. He was glad that his AT-field could be used for something constructive, and not just something for him to worry about. But as he continued wading through the pile of cars, he became more careless. He hadn't considered it before, and had only initially wanted to prevent any broken pieces of glass or metal from slashing the tires of their station wagon as Asuka drove down the center of the lane, but he had forgotten that the cars around him were basically gasoline bombs that were waiting to go off.

这是一项乏味且费力的工作，但真嗣打算坚持到底。他很高兴自己的 AT 力场能用于建设性的事情，而不仅仅是为了担心。但随着他继续在成堆的汽车中跋涉，他变得越发粗心。之前他并未考虑到这一点，最初只是想防止破碎的玻璃或金属片划破他们的旅行车轮胎，因为明日香正沿着车道中央行驶，但他忘记了周围的汽车基本上都是等待引爆的汽油炸弹。

As he grew more reckless, and wanted to hurry through this faster, he began applying more pressure to the sides of the cars to move them off the road. One car in particular, was flipped on its side down the middle of the lane, with a puddle of gasoline accumulating underneath it. Shinji missed this, and when he went to push the next line of cars, he applied too much force, generating sparks from the friction of metal between the many cars around him. Next second, a fiery explosion exploded around him.

随着他变得越来越鲁莽，急于加快速度，他开始对车辆两侧施加更大的压力，试图将它们推离道路。其中一辆车尤为严重，被掀翻在车道中央，下方积聚了一滩汽油。真嗣没有注意到这一幕，当他准备推动下一排车辆时，用力过猛，导致周围众多车辆间的金属摩擦产生了火花。紧接着，一场熊熊烈火在他周围爆炸开来。

A chain reaction from all the cars on the highway began, one exploding after another, until the entire road was bathed in a sea of fire and wreckage of twisted metal. Asuka had been many paces behind him in the car when this happened, and had thankfully been clear of the wreckage, but her mind had turned white. One second Shinji was there, and then the next he had disappeared.

高速公路上所有车辆的连锁反应开始了，一辆接一辆地爆炸，直到整条道路被火海和扭曲的金属残骸所吞没。在这场灾难发生时，明日香的车远远地跟在后面，幸运地避开了残骸，但她的思绪却一片空白。前一秒真嗣还在那里，下一秒他就消失了。

As the fireballs subsided, and the gasoline was spent, all that remained were twisted pieces of metal and melted plastic burning brightly. Slowly, Asuka stepped out of the car, her face white as paper. This couldn't have happened, not now...not when. Even from here she could still feel the heat of the fires which continued burning.

随着火球逐渐平息，汽油燃尽，只剩下扭曲的金属碎片和熔化的塑料在熊熊燃烧。慢慢地，明日香从车里走了出来，脸色苍白如纸。这不该发生，不是现在...不是在这个时候。即便站在这里，她仍能感受到那持续燃烧的火焰的热度。

She wouldn't believe it. This was all a bad dream that she was having and then she'd wake up in the car again, or maybe back in their home in Tokyo-2 beside him. Something was wrong with this scenario. He couldn't be gone. It was then that she realized she hadn't said anything, still in shock over what had just happened.

她无法相信这一切。这不过是一场糟糕的梦，她会再次在车里醒来，或者回到东京-2 的家中，躺在他身边。这个场景有些不对劲。他不可能就这样消失。就在那时，她意识到自己一句话也没说，仍然震惊于刚刚发生的事情。

"SHINJI!" “真嗣！”

She screamed his name, her voice shaking, with tears beginning to stream down her face. She called him again and again until her voice was hoarse and broke. She wanted to run into the flames and search for him, but they were simply too strong. This couldn't have happened, there were so many things she still wanted to say to him, to do with him.

她尖叫着他的名字，声音颤抖，泪水开始顺着脸颊流下。她一遍又一遍地呼唤他，直到声音嘶哑破碎。她想冲进火海寻找他，但火焰实在太猛烈。这不可能发生，她还有那么多话想对他说，那么多事想和他一起做。

Falling to her knees, she continued calling him, her voice growing weaker and weaker. It felt like somebody was constricting her throat, preventing her from calling him, but that was probably from the smoke. Why hadn't they just stayed in Tokyo-2? If so, this would never have happened.

她跪倒在地，继续呼唤着他，声音越来越微弱。仿佛有人扼住了她的喉咙，让她无法呼喊，但这大概是因为烟雾的缘故。为何他们没有留在东京-2 呢？如果那样，这一切都不会发生。

Her wailing voice continued around the highway, and even animals were beginning to take notice, curious of what was happening, but of course, none of them would approach her.

她的哀嚎声在高速公路上回荡，连动物们也开始注意到这异常，好奇究竟发生了什么，但当然，它们没有一个会靠近她。

As she continued crying however, reality began to set in for Asuka. What was she to do now? The possibility of one of them dying: she had thought about this before, but now that such a thing happened, what was she going to do? Was she supposed to just continue on living by herself? Find a new place to live? An empty house with nobody but herself?

然而，随着她继续哭泣，现实开始在明日香心中沉淀。她现在该怎么办？他们中有人可能会死：她以前曾考虑过这一点，但现在这种情况真的发生了，她该怎么办？她应该继续独自生活吗？找一个新地方住？一个空荡荡的房子，只有她一个人？

No, she didn't think she could do that. Once upon a time, yes, but that had been before she had gotten to know Shinji.

不，她不认为她能做到。曾经，是的，但在她认识真嗣之前。

"Without Shinji...I..." mumbled Asuka, her face thick with tears.

“没有真嗣...我...”明日香喃喃自语，泪流满面。

A certain noise jolted her however, the sound of something heavy being thrown, and the crunch of metal.

然而，一阵突如其来的噪音惊动了她，那是重物被抛掷的声音，以及金属的嘎吱声。

Looking up, she just barely saw the empty shell of a car being sent over the right lanes guardrail and over the slope. The smoke was so thick that she couldn't see through it, but something had moved within the pile of twisted metal.

她抬头望去，勉强看到一辆汽车的空壳被抛过右侧车道的护栏，翻滚下斜坡。浓烟密布，她无法透过烟雾看清，但似乎有什么东西在扭曲的金属堆中移动。

"Shinji!" she yelled, her voice not as strong as it once was, but even so, it still carried enough. But still, she didn't get a reply.

“真嗣！”她喊道，声音虽不如从前那般有力，但依旧足够响亮。然而，她并未得到回应。

Instead, a shape emerged from the cloud of smoke. Bare feet walked towards her, the owner not caring about the scorching pavement or the shards of glass and metal that they were walking over. The left side of his torso was completely bare, and what fabric remained of his shirt was charred and scorched, barely hanging on by a thread. Soot covered his entire body from head to toe, and his left arm was a bloody mass of muscle fibers with pockets of skin that looked as though they were slowly covering his arm. He looked worn and tired, but his eyes were glowing a vivid red, determination within them.

取而代之的是，一个身影从烟雾中显现。赤脚向她走来，主人毫不在意那滚烫的人行道或是脚下踩着的玻璃与金属碎片。他左侧的躯干完全裸露，衬衫的残余布料被烧得焦黑，仅靠一丝线勉强挂着。从头到脚，他的全身都被煤烟覆盖，左臂则是一团血肉模糊的肌肉纤维，皮肤像是在缓慢地覆盖其上。他看起来疲惫不堪，但双眼却闪烁着鲜红的亮光，眼中充满了决心。

Asuka wanted to run towards that figure, but was afraid that she was hallucinating, that what she was seeing wasn't real. He almost seemed like a ghost that had just risen from a grave. But when he called her, she realized that it was none other than the Shinji that she knew.

明日香想要奔向那个身影，却又害怕自己是在幻觉中，所见并非真实。他几乎像是一个刚从坟墓中升起的幽灵。但当他呼唤她时，她意识到那正是她所认识的真嗣。

"...Asuka..." “……明日香……”

His voice was rough and raspy, and sounded as though he had inhaled far too much smoke than any normal human could, but when Asuka heard him, her legs finally found the power to move, and she nearly jumped into his arms, knocking him to the ground.

他的声音沙哑而粗糙，听起来像是吸入了远超常人所能承受的烟雾，但当明日香听到他的声音时，她的双腿终于恢复了力量，她几乎跳进了他的怀里，将他撞倒在地。

"...Asuka," mumbled Shinji as he clutched her with his good arm.

“……明日香，”真嗣用他那只没受伤的手臂紧紧抱住她，喃喃道。

"You idiot!" she yelled, finding her voice through the tears. "You stupid, reckless, careless, moron! I thought you-"

"你这个白痴！" 她哭喊着，泪水中的声音逐渐清晰。"你这个愚蠢、鲁莽、粗心的笨蛋！我以为你——"

"I'm here," said Shinji. "我在这里，" 真嗣说道。

That was almost too much for Asuka, and she finally buried her face in his chest, not caring about the soot, sweat, blood, or the fact that her face was pressed against his bare chest, and cried.

这对明日香来说几乎难以承受，她最终将脸埋进他的胸膛，不顾那煤灰、汗水、血迹，也不在乎自己的脸紧贴着他赤裸的胸膛，放声大哭。

Slowly they fell to the ground, Asuka still sobbing, and Shinji with his face rather passive. Glancing down at his arm, he saw that it had almost healed already. It had been close for him.

他们缓缓倒在地上，明日香仍在啜泣，而真嗣的脸上则是一副漠然的表情。他低头看向自己的手臂，发现伤口几乎已经愈合。对他来说，那真是千钧一发。

When the first car exploded, he had immediately thrown up his AT-field in front of him, protecting his face. The second explosion had caught him off guard however, and he had been far to slow in creating a dome around his body, which had resulted in the skin on his left arm being completely burned away. Afterwards, he had created the dome just before the third explosion, and had prevented himself from become nothing more than a burned piece of flesh. He had been far to careless, as Asuka had said. Even though he disliked it, he had been careless because of how powerful his AT-field was and his regenerative abilities. If he was honest with himself, he felt that he was unstoppable. This was a crude wake up call to the fact that he was still human, and could still die. He had lost a lot of blood, and didn't think he'd be able to move much for a while.

当第一辆车爆炸时，他立刻在他面前展开了 AT 力场，保护住自己的脸。然而，第二次爆炸让他措手不及，他反应太慢，未能及时在身体周围形成一个穹顶，导致左臂的皮肤被完全烧毁。之后，他在第三次爆炸前及时创造了穹顶，避免了变成一团焦肉。正如明日香所说，他太过粗心大意。尽管他不喜欢这样，但他的粗心是因为他的 AT 力场强大和再生能力。如果诚实地面对自己，他会觉得自己不可阻挡。这是一个粗暴的提醒，告诉他他仍然是人类，仍然可能死去。他失血过多，认为自己短期内无法移动太多。

"Better now Asuka?" “现在好些了吗，明日香？”

A small hiccup greeted his question followed with a quiet, "Of course not."

他的问题迎来了一个小小的哽咽，随后是一声轻柔的，“当然没有。”

"Can you at least help me to the car? I honestly can't walk very well right now."

“你至少能帮我走到车那边吗？老实说，我现在走路真的很困难。”

"...I can," mumbled Asuka.

“……我可以。”明日香咕哝道。

Throwing his good arm around her shoulder, Shinji let Asuka bring him to the car, where he sat down in the passenger seat. Quietly, he yanked out two large shards of glass that had pierced his feet, wincing at the pain as he did, but not complaining. Asuka kneeled next to him as he did this. Her eyes were incredibly bloodshot from the crying, but she didn't seem to care about appearances right now.

用他那只好手揽住她的肩膀，真嗣让明日香扶着他走向汽车，坐在了副驾驶座上。他默默地拔出刺入脚掌的两块大玻璃碎片，拔出时因疼痛而皱眉，却并未抱怨。明日香跪在他身旁，双眼因哭泣而布满血丝，但她此刻似乎并不在意自己的模样。

"What now?" asked Shinji.

“现在怎么办？” 真嗣问道。

"What the fuck do you mean what now?" retorted Asuka, her anger suddenly flaring. "You nearly just died and you ask what now?"

“你他妈的现在是什么意思？” 明日香反驳道，她的怒火突然爆发。“你差点就死了，你还问现在怎么办？”

Shinji was silent, knowing that he deserved that. He wouldn't be able to move for a while, or help clear the wreckage for that matter. But just sitting here felt even more worthless than at least trying something.

真嗣沉默了，知道那是他应得的。他暂时无法移动，更别提帮忙清理废墟了。但就这样坐在这里，感觉比至少尝试做点什么还要无用。

They sat in silence for a while. Asuka it seemed was torn between relief over Shinji being alive, and angry at him for wanting to move on after nearly dying. As they continued sitting there though, a gentle breeze began to pick up, and the smoke began to clear from the earlier fireball.

他们沉默地坐了一会儿。明日香似乎在为真嗣还活着而感到宽慰，同时又对他想在几乎丧命后继续前进感到愤怒。然而，随着他们继续坐在那里，一阵微风开始吹起，早先火球的烟雾也开始消散。

Whether by sheer coincidence, or dumb luck, most of the cars which had been blocking the road had been blown out of the way because of the explosions. The fires had died down, and most of the glass had been melted directly into the pavement. Asuka saw all this, and had to think herself incredibly dumb, or just desperate to consider navigating through this mess. But she knew if she took her time, it was possible.

无论是纯粹的巧合，还是纯粹的幸运，大多数原本堵塞道路的汽车都因为爆炸而被炸飞了。火势已经减弱，大部分玻璃直接熔化在路面上。明日香看到了这一切，不得不认为自己极其愚蠢，或者只是绝望到考虑穿越这片混乱。但她知道，如果她慢慢来，这是有可能的。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji as Asuka got into the driver seat.

“你在做什么？”真嗣问道，明日香坐进了驾驶座。

"Navigating us out of here," she replied.

"带我们离开这里，"她回答道。"

"Asuka thats-" "明日香，那是——"

"Shut up and let me concentrated Shinji."

"闭嘴，让我专心，真嗣。"

It was only because of how much force her voice held that Shinji didn't argue.

正是因为她的声音中蕴含了如此强大的力量，真嗣才没有反驳。

Starting the car, Asuka inched forward slowly, and began weaving her way through the wreckage. Several times she stopped the car and got out, examining her options, or moving something out of the way by using whatever she had on hand. Thankfully, it wasn't far until they reached the spot where the shoulder widened, and were able to cruise down that the rest of the way.

启动汽车，明日香缓缓前行，开始穿梭于废墟之间。她多次停车并下车，检查可行的路线，或利用手边的一切移开障碍物。幸运的是，他们不久就到达了肩道变宽的地方，得以沿着那条路继续平稳行驶。

After passing through the entirety of the traffic jam, Asuka stopped the car and got out, breathing a sigh of relief. Shinji opened the door, but didn't stand up, unsure whether his legs would support him quite yet.

穿过整个交通堵塞区域后，明日香停下车并走出车门，松了一口气。真嗣打开车门，但没有站起来，不确定自己的双腿是否还能支撑住。

"Well we're through there at least," said Shinji.

“至少我们已经通过了那里。” 真嗣说道。

Asuka glared at him, but at the same time felt herself smile slightly.

明日香瞪了他一眼，但同时嘴角不由自主地微微上扬。

"Don't ever do something like that again Shinji."

“别再做那种事了，真嗣。”

"Asuka-" “明日香——”

"Promise me now," she said, staring right into his eyes which had lost their red shine a while ago.

"现在就答应我，" 她直视着他的眼睛，那双曾经闪烁着红光的眼眸早已黯淡无光。

"Okay, okay, I promise." "好的，好的，我答应你。"

"Good." "很好。"

Throwing her arms over her head, she stretched, looking around at there surroundings. It was then that she noticed a sign on the shoulder of the road. Looking at it further, she mumbled the words several more times to herself, and then glanced over at Shinji.

她双臂高举过头，伸了个懒腰，环顾四周的环境。就在这时，她注意到路边肩上立着一个标志。她仔细看了看，又喃喃自语了几遍，然后瞥向了真嗣。

"I think I just had an idea," she grinned

“我好像有个主意了，”她咧嘴笑道

Asuka's idea turned out to be rather ridiculous considering the season, but it was warm out, so Shinji went along with it.

考虑到季节，明日香的主意显得颇为荒唐，但天气暖和，真嗣也就随她去了。

About five miles up the road from where Asuka saw the sign was a river that ran underneath the highway. As they continued driving, the amount of cars became less and less until finally when they reached the bridge, they were only one of ten cars they could see from where they were.

从明日香看到路标的地方往上行驶约五英里，有一条河流在高速公路下方流淌。随着他们继续前行，车辆逐渐减少，直到最终抵达桥头时，他们能看到的车辆仅剩十辆左右。

The river itself wasn't very large, and was only about forty feet wide if Shinji had to guess. On one side of the shoulder, there was a slanting slope that you could walk down to get to the river, so Asuka did this, and pulled off to the side.

河流本身并不宽阔，若让真嗣猜测，大约只有四十英尺宽。河岸一侧有个斜坡，可以走下去直达河边，于是明日香便顺着斜坡而下，将车停靠在旁。

Stepping out of the vehicle, Asuka walked around to the back hatch and began opening several boxes. Wondering what she was doing, Shinji couldn't help but ask.

走出车辆，明日香绕到后备箱，开始打开几个箱子。好奇她在找什么，真嗣忍不住问道。

"What are you looking for Asuka?"

“你在找什么，明日香？”

"Soap, shampoo, conditioner, and a towel. I know I packed some, though I'm not sure which box it was."

“肥皂、洗发水、护发素和毛巾。我知道我打包了一些，只是不确定在哪个箱子里。”

Shinji didn't bother pointing out that this was likely a waste of space, but Asuka was still a girl afterall, and wanted to cleanse herself if possible. Stepping slowly out of the car, Shinji tested his feet against the pavement. He still felt incredibly tired, and wasn't even sure if he wanted to get down to the river, but Asuka said-

真嗣没有费心指出这可能是浪费空间，但毕竟明日香还是个女孩子，如果可能的话，她想尽可能地清洁自己。慢慢地从车里走出来，真嗣用脚试探着路面。他仍然感到非常疲惫，甚至不确定是否想走到河边，但明日香说——

"You either walk down, or I'm rolling you down."

“你要么自己走下去，要么我就把你滚下去。”

Shinji thought that she would be more caring, considering he had almost died not even an hour ago, but she seemed to want to put that memory as quickly behind her as possible. Plus she still blamed him for the whole mishap in the first place.

真嗣本以为她会更有同情心，毕竟不到一小时前他差点丧命，但她似乎想尽快把这段记忆抛诸脑后。再加上她仍然把整个意外归咎于他。

Asuka eventually agreed to assist helping Shinji walk down to the river however, and without too much difficulty, they reached the bottom bellow. The shoreline was littered with rocks that had been washed up on the side by floods that had no doubt happened in the past, but the river itself wasn't very deep. About ten feet out it was hardly knee deep, and then dipped to chest height. The current wasn't very strong either, but the water wasn't stagnant and had a clear blue look to it.

最终，明日香同意帮助真嗣走到河边，他们没费太多周折就到达了河岸。岸边散落着被洪水冲上岸的石头，这些洪水无疑在过去发生过，但河水本身并不深。大约十英尺外，水深仅及膝盖，然后逐渐加深至胸部高度。水流也不算很强，但水并不停滞，呈现出清澈的蓝色。

Choosing a large rock, Shinji sat down on it and leaned back, letting out a low sigh. He still felt tired, but he had to admit that it was nice to just sit here.

真嗣选择了一块大石头坐下，向后靠去，发出一声低沉的叹息。他仍然感到疲惫，但他不得不承认，坐在这里的感觉很好。

"Shinji, you should really wash up as well."

“真嗣，你也应该去洗洗。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"You didn't bother to look at yourself in the rearview mirror in the car did you?"

“你在车上都没照照后视镜看看自己吗？”

Shinji still had large black patches of soot on his face, arms, and legs, and he hadn't even bothered to change out of his burnt shirt.

真嗣脸上、手臂和腿上还留有大片黑色煤灰，连烧焦的衬衫都没换掉。

"Tell me how the water is first, and then I'll make a decision."

"先告诉我水的情况，然后我再做决定。"

"See for yourself," grinned Asuka as she cupped water in her hands, and then threw it at Shinji. He was just close enough for it to land directly on his face. The water was cold, but not icy, and the sun was still high in the sky.

"你自己看吧，" 明日香笑着用手捧起水，然后朝真嗣泼去。他站得足够近，水直接打在了他的脸上。水很凉，但并不刺骨，阳光依旧高悬在天空。

'What the hell,' thought Shinji.

“搞什么鬼，”真嗣心想。

Standing up, he walked over to where Asuka was standing, and then passed her. Pulling off the remains of his shirt, he tossed it to the side, not really caring where it landed, as he likely wouldn't wear it ever again, and waded slowly into the water. He was wearing shorts, and his feet were still bare, but the pleasant feel of the water hitting his legs made him suddenly feel like swimming for a bit. He had swam back in Tokyo-3 when they had explored the Geofront, but that seemed like ages ago.

他站起身，走向站在那里的明日香，然后从她身边走过。他脱下破烂的衬衫，随手一扔，并不在意它会落在何处，因为他可能再也不会穿它了，然后慢慢走进水中。他穿着短裤，脚还是赤裸的，但水触碰到双腿的愉悦感觉让他突然想游一会儿。他在东京-3 时曾在探索地底空间时游过泳，但那似乎已是许久以前的事了。

Wading further out into the water, he let it reach up to his chest before he finally kicked his legs out behind him and swam. It wasn't even really swimming though, since the area was so small, and multiple times Shinji accidentally kicked a rock, but it did relax him. Dunking himself under several times, he let the water wash over him, removing the soot from his body. It hardly felt that he had been in a life or death situation earlier.

他继续向水深处走去，直到水深及胸，才终于蹬腿向后游去。虽然这算不上真正的游泳，因为这片水域太小，好几次真嗣不小心踢到了石头，但这确实让他放松了。他几次潜入水中，让水流冲刷身体，洗去身上的煤灰。他几乎感觉不到自己之前处于生死攸关的境地。

"I take it the water is fine," came Asuka's voice from the shoreline. Shinji would have dearly liked to do to Asuka what she had done earlier, but he was too far away at this point.

“看来水还不错。”明日香的声音从岸边传来。真嗣真想对明日香做她之前对他做的事，但此刻他们相距太远。

"Yeah its fine. If you want to swim, I can get out since there isn't much room for two people."

"嗯，没关系。如果你想游泳，我可以出去，因为这里不太宽敞，容不下两个人。"

"No, thats okay," replied Asuka.

"不用了，没关系，" 明日香回答道。"

At first, Shinji didn't know why she was okay with this, and then the answer became apparent: slowly, Asuka began undressing. First she removed her T-shirt, and threw it onto a nearby rock, and then unbuttoned her pants, bringing them down past her legs before stepping gingerly out of them. Lastly, and Shinji hadn't known she was wearing it, she unclasped the necklace he had gotten her for Christmas, and placed this inside her jeans pocket. All this happened far too fast for Shinji to comprehend, and next second, Asuka was wading out to him in nothing but a white tank top, and white panties.

起初，真嗣不明白她为何对此无所谓，但答案很快变得显而易见：明日香开始慢慢脱去衣物。她先是脱掉了 T 恤，扔到附近的一块石头上，然后解开裤子的扣子，将裤子从腿上褪下，小心翼翼地走出裤子。最后，真嗣之前并不知道她还戴着它，她解开了他送给她的圣诞节项链，并将其放入牛仔裤口袋。这一切发生得太快，真嗣来不及反应，下一刻，明日香只穿着一件白色背心和白色内裤，涉水向他走来。

Shinji's face turned bright red, and as Asuka neared him, her face steadily became redder until it wouldn't have been unexpected for the water to boil around her. When she finally reached the deeper part of the river where he was at, it was with a significantly more embarrassed face. The ends of her long hair were gently flowing through the water as she stood in front of him, and her tank top was plastered against her body, revealing the white bra underneath. Shinji's eyes couldn't help but migrate towards this sight, and Asuka was also very aware of his gaze.

真嗣的脸变得通红，而当明日香靠近他时，她的脸也逐渐变红，直到周围的水仿佛都要沸腾起来。当她终于到达河中较深的地方，站在他面前时，她的表情明显更加尴尬。她长发的末梢在水中轻轻飘动，而她的背心紧贴着身体，露出了下面的白色胸罩。真嗣的目光不由自主地移向了这一幕，明日香也清楚地察觉到了他的视线。

With a rather knowing smirk, Asuka said, "Pervert," before she swam past him.

明日香带着一种了然的微笑，说道：“色狼。”然后从他身边游过。

Shinji couldn't help but follow her with his eyes as she swam down the river a little, still dumbstruck over what he had just witnessed.

真嗣不由自主地用目光追随着她，她沿着河流游开了一点，而他仍然对刚刚所见的一幕感到震惊。

Shinji didn't spend much more time in the river after this, but he did feel better at the very least. Sitting on one of the rocks he watched Asuka go from swimming, to simply floating in the water. The current barely pushed her forward, and she only occasionally had to paddle herself backwards to keep herself from drifting. Her hair which was now reaching her waist was splayed out behind her, floating in the water in an uncaring like manner. Shinji had been rather struck dumb over what Asuka had done, but sitting here on the shoreline, and watching her, he couldn't deny that she wasn't cute, or beautiful for that matter. They were both fifteen, and still developing, but Asuka was already beautiful enough that she looked like somebody in their early twenties.

自那以后，真嗣在河里逗留的时间并不多，但他至少感觉好些了。他坐在一块岩石上，看着明日香从游泳变为只是漂浮在水面上。水流几乎不推动她前进，她只是偶尔需要划水后退以避免漂走。她那已及腰的长发散落在身后，无拘无束地漂浮在水面上。真嗣对明日香的行为颇为震惊，但坐在这岸边，看着她，他不得不承认她既可爱又美丽。两人都十五岁，还在成长中，但明日香已经美得像二十出头的人了。

'...And she's grown I think.'

'...我想她已经长大了。'

As to where, Shinji didn't really need to specify.

至于具体在哪里，真嗣其实不需要特别说明。

Well, this wasn't that surprising at the same time either, that Shinji would begin to notice these things about her. Even back in Tokyo-3, when they had first met, Asuka's figure was striking enough as it was, but half a year had almost gone by, and noticeable things had started to change. Even as he sat there, he could see the distinct curves of her figure.

好吧，这同时也不算太令人惊讶，真嗣开始注意到她身上的这些变化。即便是在他们初次相遇的东京-3，那时明日香的身形就已经相当引人注目，但半年时间几乎一晃而过，一些显著的变化已经开始显现。即便他坐在那里，也能清楚地看到她身形的曲线。

But it went further than that as well. Shinji was in the midst of puberty, and it wasn't as though he was oblivious to certain urges that he felt, mainly during the times they had slept together. More than once, he was self conscious of the trouble growing below his waist, and even now, as he watched her, such a thing was happening. He wasn't an idiot, but neither was he sure whether it was simple male anatomy that was making this happen, or if he was truly attracted to her. Well, he supposed he was, but on another level, as in sexually? When did simple attraction end, and the desire to make love begin though?

但事情远不止如此。真嗣正处于青春期，他并非对某些冲动一无所知，尤其是在他们共眠的时刻。不止一次，他对自己腰下逐渐升起的困扰感到尴尬，即便此刻凝视着她，这样的情况也在发生。他并非傻瓜，但也不确定这是否仅仅是男性生理反应，还是他真的被她吸引。嗯，他觉得应该是后者，但在另一个层面上，比如性方面？单纯的吸引何时结束，渴望做爱的欲望又何时开始呢？

"Stupid thoughts," mumbled Shinji, trying to shake these away.

"愚蠢的想法。" 真嗣喃喃自语，试图将这些念头甩开。

Though not entirely untrue either. Shinji hadn't a clue what Asuka's thoughts were on the matter, but she must at least realize what a young boy and girl in the midst of puberty, not to mention sharing the same bed, could potentially lead to. If they hadn't been the only two apparent people living on earth, this situation would have been incredibly absurd, not to mention frowned upon by any adult that discovered this. But that wasn't likely to happen anytime soon.

虽然也不完全错。真嗣并不清楚明日香对此事的想法，但她至少该明白，青春期的少男少女，更别提还同床共枕，可能会引发什么后果。如果他们不是地球上仅存的两个人，这种情况简直荒谬至极，任何成年人发现都会皱眉反对。但这种事近期内不太可能发生。

As Shinji watched her, Asuka seemed to decide she was done swimming, and began returning to the shore. Though Shinji thought she would begin drying herself off, she instead grabbed the bottle of shampoo and conditioner. Wading back into the water, until the water began lapping at her chest, she began applying the shampoo to her hair. From his position, Shinji could clearly see Asuka's back, entirely exposed due to the thin fabric from her tank top that still clung to her skin. Shinji wasn't sure what would be more stimulating, the fact that he could see her bare skin through the fabric, or if she completely removed the tank top entirely. Either one wouldn't do much to alter the feeling between his legs.

当真嗣注视着她时，明日香似乎决定结束游泳，开始返回岸边。尽管真嗣以为她会开始擦干自己，她却拿起了一瓶洗发水和护发素。再次踏入水中，直到水波轻拍她的胸口，她开始将洗发水涂抹在头发上。从他的位置，真嗣能清楚地看到明日香的后背，由于紧贴皮肤的薄薄背心布料，她的背部几乎完全裸露。真嗣不确定哪种情景更令人兴奋，是透过布料看到她的裸露肌肤，还是她完全脱掉背心。无论哪种情况，对他双腿间的感觉影响都不大。

After shampooing her hair down, she then dunked it in the water, and afterwards began applying the conditioner. After she came up out of the water the second time, Shinji had to hold his breath as the suns rays began peaking out from behind the clouds, turning her already fiery hair an almost breathtakingly red and orange hue. The sun seemed drawn to her, as it reflected off the water droplets that still clung to her body, making her skin almost too dazzling to see. Shinji didn't consider himself a romantic by any means, but even he had to admit that Asuka looked like a goddess at that moment.

洗发水冲洗完毕后，她将头发浸入水中，随后开始涂抹护发素。当她第二次从水中浮现时，阳光开始从云层后透出，将她本就火红的秀发染成了一种几乎令人屏息的橘红色。太阳似乎被她吸引，阳光反射在她身上残留的水珠上，使她的肌肤显得过于耀眼，难以直视。尽管自认绝非浪漫之人，但就连真嗣也不得不承认，那一刻的明日香宛如女神般美丽。

As she returned towards the waters edge, the sun disappeared behind the clouds again, making the momentarily vision seem almost like a dream. Grabbing the bar of soap, she walked in till the water reached her knees, and began lathering down her whole body. Shinji wasn't sure whether he could take much more of this, and even had a nagging suspicion that Asuka was doing all this just to make him feel uncomfortable. But when she started applying the soap to her smooth legs, Shinji had to turn away, owing to the distinct outline of her butt that was practically pointed directly at him.

当她走回水边时，太阳再次隐入云层，那一瞬的景象仿佛梦境般不真实。她抓起肥皂，一步步走进水中，直到水没过膝盖，开始全身涂抹起泡沫。真嗣不确定自己还能承受多少，甚至隐约怀疑明日香这么做只是为了让他感到不适。但当她开始在光滑的腿上涂抹肥皂时，真嗣不得不转过身去，因为她的臀部轮廓清晰地正对着他，几乎像是在刻意指给他看。

"Damn it," he mumbled under his breath.

“该死，”他低声咕哝道。

Shortly later, Asuka waded back into the water, and rinsed the soap from her body, before returning to the shore where Shinji still was. Drying herself off with the towel, she then changed back into her clothes, her eyes glancing towards Shinji, wondering why his gaze was off in another direction.

不久后，明日香再次踏入水中，洗净身上的肥皂泡，然后回到岸边，那里真嗣还在。她用毛巾擦干身体，换回衣服，眼睛瞥向真嗣，好奇为什么他的目光飘向别处。

"Well, I feel refreshed," Asuka said, letting out a low sigh as she stretched her arms out above her. "You ready to go?"

“嗯，我感觉神清气爽，”明日香说着，低声叹息，伸展双臂。“准备好走了吗？”

"Give me a minute. I'm still a bit tired after all."

"给我一分钟。毕竟我还有点累。"

That wasn't the reason at all, but if Shinji stood up, the true problem would be only too apparent, and though he didn't realize, Asuka did glance towards that spot, but didn't comment on it.

那根本不是原因，但如果真嗣站起来，真正的问题就会显而易见，尽管他没意识到，明日香确实瞥向了那个地方，但没有评论。

"Suit yourself," she simply said, and then plopped down on the rock beside him.

"随你便，"她简单地说，然后一屁股坐在他旁边的石头上。"

Shinji would have rather her not do this, as the image of her well outlined figure was still circulating around his brain, and now the fragrance of the shampoo she had used was wafting in his direction, making any attempt at calming himself nearly impossible.

真嗣宁愿她不要这么做，因为她那轮廓分明的身影仍在脑海中挥之不去，而现在她使用的洗发水香味正飘向他这边，让他几乎无法平静下来。

Glancing over at her, he saw that Asuka was leaning back on her rock, her eyes looking up towards the sky. Noticing his gaze however, Asuka turned her eyes instead towards him with a questioning look.

他瞥了她一眼，看到明日香正靠在她的石头上，眼睛望向天空。然而注意到他的目光后，明日香转而用询问的眼神看向他。

"Something wrong?" she asked.

"有什么不对劲吗？" 她问道。

"...Nothing," said Shinji, aware that his face was turning slightly red. He wasn't sure whether he'd be able to handle sleeping beside her tonight after what he had seen here. The simple image of her practically naked body wasn't going to leave his brain anytime soon. Well, better to get things over with sooner rather than later he supposed.

"...没什么，" 真嗣说道，意识到自己的脸颊微微泛红。他不确定今晚能否在她身边入睡，尤其是在看到了刚才那一幕后。她近乎赤裸的身体形象短时间内恐怕难以从他脑海中抹去。嗯，他认为还是早点解决比较好，拖得越久越麻烦。

Standing up, he said, "Alright, I'm ready I guess."

他站起来，说道："好吧，我想我已经准备好了。"

"Need any help walking back up the hill?"

"需要帮忙走回山坡上吗？"

"No, I can manage," said Shinji, rather forcefully shaking his head. The last thing he needed was for her to stand directly beside him.

"不用，我可以的，" 真嗣相当坚决地摇了摇头。他最不需要的就是她直接站在他旁边。

Walking back of the hill in single file, Shinji made sure to keep several steps ahead of her, and made a point of getting in the car before Asuka did. He hadn't felt so self conscious about this before, so why was it affecting him now?

排成一列走在山丘后方，真嗣特意保持了几步领先于她，并刻意在明日香之前上了车。他以前从未如此在意过这些，为何现在却影响着他呢？

"Okay, onward we go," said Asuka as she started the car, and continued driving down the highway. Shinji kept his eyes mainly focused on the scenery that passed by as they drove, but his mind couldn't help but wander back to Asuka's beautiful figure.

"好了，我们继续前进。" 明日香说着启动了汽车，继续沿着高速公路行驶。真嗣的目光主要集中在沿途的风景上，但他的思绪却不由自主地飘回到了明日香美丽的身影上。

While Shinji had his own thoughts swirling around his head, he didn't notice Asuka's eyes wavering towards him occasionally as she drove.

尽管真嗣脑海中思绪纷飞，他并未察觉到偶尔驾驶时明日香目光的游移。

'I wonder if I was too obvious?' wondered Asuka. She still liked to toy around with his feelings and tease him a bit, but at some point she would have liked to hear him say something, even if it was a half-baked response.

“我是不是太明显了？”明日香暗自思忖。她依旧喜欢逗弄他的情感，稍加挑逗，但某一刻她倒希望他能说些什么，哪怕只是个半吊子的回应。

'Though I suppose he said something in his own way,' thought Asuka, feeling a little embarrassed as she thought this. Shinji was a guy afterall, so his reaction wasn't unexpected.

“不过我想他以自己的方式表达了，”明日香想到这里，感到一丝羞涩。毕竟真嗣是个男生，他的反应也在意料之中。

At the same time though, Asuka couldn't help but feel a little weird, knowing that Shinji had had that reaction towards her. She understood human physiology well enough, so she knew what that meant and all, but when it was directed at her, it was a different feeling.

然而与此同时，得知真嗣对自己有那种反应，明日香不禁感到有些怪异。她对人体生理学颇有了解，所以明白那意味着什么，但当这种反应针对她时，感觉就截然不同了。

'Has he felt that way before?'

“他以前有过这种感觉吗？”

At that though, Asuka had to stop her thoughts. Just the simple thought process she was going through was dangerously close to territory that she didn't want to explore.

想到这里，明日香不得不打断自己的思绪。她正在进行的简单思考过程，已经危险地接近了她不愿探索的领域。

Instead, she pushed everything to the back of her mind, and instead focused on driving towards there destination, whatever that may be.

相反，她将一切思绪抛诸脑后，转而专注于驾车前往目的地，无论那是什么地方。

Whatever may have befallen the coastal cities of Japan because of Third Impact, like Tokyo-3, and Tokyo-2, inland Japan seemed to have been largely unaffected. As they continued driving, they started passing small communities, mainly dedicated to farmland for the cultivation of rice, which was of course a staple of the Japanese diet. Less and less cars were found abandoned on the highway, and Asuka was beginning to wonder if they were even going in a direction that was remotely close to another town. Japan wasn't a very big country afterall, and it didn't take long to drive from the Pacific Ocean side, to the Sea of Japan side.

无论日本沿海城市因第三次冲击遭受了何种灾难，如第三新东京市和第二新东京市，内陆地区似乎并未受到太大影响。随着他们继续行驶，开始经过一些小社区，主要致力于水稻种植，这当然是日本饮食中的主食。高速公路上废弃的车辆越来越少，明日香开始怀疑他们是否正朝着接近另一个城镇的方向前进。毕竟，日本并不是一个很大的国家，从太平洋一侧开车到日本海一侧并不需要太长时间。

Just as she was about to suggest they turn off at the very next exit and head either east or west, a sign came into view, indicating the next town was ten miles away, or roughly twenty kilometers. At least they knew they were headed towards a town, but whether they would decide to stay was a different matter. They didn't really know what they were looking for in the first place.

正当她准备建议在下一个出口转弯，向东或向西行驶时，一个路标映入眼帘，指示下一个城镇距离此处十英里，约合二十公里。至少他们知道正朝着某个城镇前进，但决定是否停留则是另一回事。他们其实并不清楚自己在寻找什么。

When they got closer to the town, the farmland around them began to disappear, being replaced with small commercial buildings, which included a small shopping center they could see as they drove past. At the very least, they had a place to stock up on food if they needed to.

当他们接近城镇时，周围的农田开始消失，取而代之的是一些小型的商业建筑，包括他们开车经过时能看到的一个小型购物中心。至少，如果需要的话，他们有一个地方可以补充食物。

Exiting off the highway, Asuka yanked a left onto the overpass, weaving around the cars which were blocking there path. At this point, she decided it was best to make a decision of where they were headed.

驶离高速公路后，明日香猛地向左拐上立交桥，绕过那些挡住他们去路的车辆。到了这个时候，她认为最好做出一个决定，明确他们要前往的方向。

"So what do you wanna do now?" her question directed at Shinji.

"那现在你想做什么？" 她的问题指向了真嗣。

"Find the nearest housing community as a start I guess. Afterwards, we can make a decision I suppose."

"首先找到最近的住宅区吧，我想。之后，我们可以再做决定。"

"Alright," said Asuka. "好吧，" 明日香说。

Continuing to drive down the road, it wasn't long until they realized the realities of this town. The town itself was a direct correlation to the farming communities that surrounded it, and as such, didn't have anything else to offer. At one point, it seemed that the place was busy enough, but besides the shopping mall, a couple fast food restaurants, and several gas stations, the town didn't have much to offer.

继续沿着道路行驶，不久他们便意识到了这个小镇的现实。小镇本身与周围的农业社区直接相关，因此并没有太多其他的东西可以提供。曾经有一段时间，这里似乎相当繁忙，但除了购物中心、几家快餐店和几个加油站之外，小镇并没有太多吸引人的地方。

The housing communities weren't anything like they were back in Tokyo-2, but were either cottages, farmhouses, or simple one story houses. Since they had come from Tokyo-2, where there previous was two story, complete with fireplace, multiple bedrooms, a large kitchen space, and a garage to boot, you could see why they found the current selection lackluster at best.

这里的住宅区与他们在东京-2 的生活截然不同，要么是村舍，要么是农舍，或者是简单的单层房屋。由于他们来自东京-2，那里有双层楼房，配有壁炉、多个卧室、宽敞的厨房空间和一个车库，不难理解为什么他们对目前的居住选择感到失望，甚至可以说是乏善可陈。

After driving off in multiple directions, and then returning to where the highway connected to the overpass, Asuka parked the car, and then turned to Shinji.

在向多个方向驶去，然后回到高速公路与立交桥的连接处后，明日香停下了车，然后转向真嗣。

"What do you think? she asked.

"你觉得呢？" 她问道。

"Well, we wanted to stay someplace different, so this certainly qualifies I suppose."

"嗯，我们想找个不一样的地方住，所以这里确实符合要求，我想。"

"Most of these houses are small, but the acreage is a bit much. I like the scenery, but the space feels far too vast."

这些房子大多很小，但占地面积却相当大。我喜欢这里的风景，但空间感觉过于辽阔。

"I suppose you're right. What now though? Do you want to stay here for the rest of the day, or continue on further down the highway? We probably have a couple hours left until it starts getting dark."

我想你是对的。现在怎么办呢？你想在这里待到天黑，还是继续沿着高速公路往前走？我们大概还有几个小时才会天黑。

Asuka didn't immediately reply, but was pondering what there next course should be. If this town was any example, they probably wouldn't find much even if they did continue along this highway. At the same time though, there was something she was rather curious to see.

明日香没有立即回答，而是在思考下一步该怎么做。如果这个小镇是个例子，即使他们继续沿着这条高速公路走，可能也找不到什么。但与此同时，她对某件事相当好奇。

"Hey Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Any idea how long it'll take for us to reach the Sea of Japan from here?"

“你知道从这儿到日本海要多久吗？”

"We've been driving for a while, so I don't think we should be very far away from the coast. Hang on a second."

“我们已经开了好一阵子了，所以我觉得离海岸应该不远了。稍等一下。”

Climbing over the backseat, he reached for his old backpack that he had carried with him all the way from Tokyo-3, and grabbed the map inside of it. Unfolding it, he found the town that they were currently in, and then how much further it was towards the coast. If they didn't hit any traffic pileups again, it wouldn't even take them two hours.

他爬过座椅，伸手去拿那个从东京-3 一路背来的旧背包，从中取出地图。展开地图，他找到了他们目前所在的小镇，以及前往海岸的距离。如果不再遇到交通堵塞，他们甚至不用两个小时就能到达。

"Two hours, maybe a little more. We're already more than halfway there. Did you want to drive all the way there?"

两个小时，或许再多一点。我们已经走了一多半的路程。你想一直开到那里吗？

"Just a thought really. I don't expect to find much more besides a small fishing village, but I thought that we could either drive up or down the coast depending on which way we decide."

"只是个想法而已。我并不指望能找到什么，除了一个小渔村，但我想我们可以根据决定的方向，沿着海岸线开车上去或下来。"

"Its better than just staying here," Shinji admitted freely.

"总比一直待在这里强。" 真嗣坦然承认。

With his words, Asuka wordlessly started the car again, and then drove back onto the highway.

随着他的话语，明日香无声地再次启动了汽车，随后驶回高速公路。

The two hours it took for them to reach the other side of Japan was met with little resistance from cars that were stopped in the middle of the road. This far on the other side of Japan, away from the once bustling cities of Tokyo-2 and Tokyo-3, traffic was hardly a problem. They continued passing farmland for a while, but this eventually gave way to empty land where rolling hills and trees simply grew. After the events of Second Impact, Japan had undergone a momentous restructuring of its infrastructure, which was initially centralized around Tokyo-2, after Old Tokyo had been swallowed by the sea, and then repurposed with Tokyo-3. This was all of course spearheaded by Nerv, and the technology that it brought to the country.

他们花了两个小时才到达日本的另一边，途中几乎没有遇到被堵在路上的车辆。远离曾经繁华的东京-2 和东京-3，在这片遥远的日本另一侧，交通问题几乎不存在。他们继续穿越农田一段时间，但最终这些农田被空旷的土地所取代，那里只有连绵起伏的丘陵和树木自然生长。在第二次冲击事件之后，日本经历了基础设施的重大重组，最初以东京-2 为中心，因为旧东京已被海水吞没，随后又以东京-3 为重心进行了改造。这一切当然都是由 Nerv 主导，以及它带给国家的技术。

After driving for the two hours, they finally climbed a sloped hill, and were greeted with the reflection of the sun off the water surface. Below them, the Sea of Japan stretched outwards from what appeared to be exactly as Asuka predicted: a small fishing village. From where they were, they could even see the broken and flooded structures of former homes and buildings far out in the water. Whether this was because of the recent Third Impact, or the rising of the sea levels after Second Impact though, they didn't know.

驱车两小时后，他们终于攀上一座斜坡，眼前豁然开朗，阳光在水面上熠熠生辉。下方，日本海向远方延伸，正如明日香所预料的那样：一个小渔村。从他们的位置望去，甚至能看到远处水面上破败不堪、被淹没的房屋和建筑。这究竟是因为最近的第三次冲击，还是第二次冲击后海平面上升所致，他们无从得知。

Driving down into the village, they passed a couple small restaurants, a small grocery store, and a couple pubs, but most of the houses were situated directly on the edge of the water. Roads dipped into the sea, making it apparent that the village had once been larger, but likely because of Second Impact, the majority of it had been washed away. Far out in the distance, multiple fishing boats could be seen floating to and fro in the water, and some had even washed up on the beach and been grounded.

驶入村庄，他们经过了几家小餐馆、一家小杂货店和几间酒吧，但大多数房屋都直接建在水边。道路蜿蜒入海，显而易见，这个村庄曾经更为庞大，但很可能因为第二次冲击，大部分已被海水冲走。远处，多艘渔船在水中来回漂荡，有些甚至被冲上沙滩，搁浅在那里。

Parking the car at a parking space directly in front of the beach, both Shinji and Asuka got out. No longer feeling tired from his near death earlier, Shinji had already put that memory behind himself and felt rather relaxed. The smell of salt from the sea filled his nostrils and he inhaled deeply. It had been a while since he had remembered what this smelled like, and he had to admit he sorta missed it, remembering the time from Tokyo-3. A breeze played across his face pleasantly, and he closed his eyes momentarily, enjoying it.

将车停在了海滩正前方的停车位上，真嗣和明日香都下了车。不再因之前的濒死经历而感到疲惫，真嗣已经将那段记忆抛诸脑后，感到相当放松。海水的咸味充盈着他的鼻腔，他深吸了一口气。他已经很久没有记起这种味道了，不得不承认他有点怀念，想起了在东京-3 的日子。一阵微风惬意地拂过他的脸庞，他闭上眼睛，享受着这一刻。

"I think I'm glad we stopped here," mumbled Asuka. The wind was whipping her hair up behind her, but she seemed to not care. "This is somehow more peaceful than it was in Tokyo-3."

“我想我很高兴我们在这里停下了，”明日香喃喃自语。风将她的头发吹得飞扬，但她似乎并不在意。“这里比在东京-3 时更宁静。”

"Yeah," mumbled Shinji, as he glanced over at Asuka. As he did so, he noticed the docks next to where they stood. Several sailing boats and fishing boats were still moored there, and Shinji wouldn't have minded taking a quick look at them, but Asuka's sudden question rather startled him.

“是啊，”真嗣咕哝着，同时瞥向明日香。就在这时，他注意到了他们站立处旁边的码头。几艘帆船和渔船仍停泊在那里，真嗣本不介意去快速看看它们，但明日香突然的问题让他有些吃惊。

"Hey Shinji, how far do you think it is from here to China?"

“嘿，真嗣，你觉得从这儿到中国有多远？”

"...I'm going to assume you mean by boat."

“……我猜你是说坐船吧。”

"I do." “是的。”

Shinji wasn't sure whether this was simple curiosity, or if her question had meaning behind it. Either way, he wasn't sure, and honestly answered her.

真嗣不确定这是单纯的兴趣使然，还是她的问题背后另有深意。无论哪种情况，他都不甚明了，便诚实地回答了她。

"I'm not really sure to be honest."

老实说，我不太确定。

"I see..." "我明白了..."

"You aren't thinking about trying to sail across the Sea of Japan are you?"

"你该不会是想尝试横渡日本海吧？"

"No," said Asuka as she shook her head. "I know its not very reasonable. Too many things could go wrong afterall."

"不，" 明日香摇着头说，"我知道这不太现实。毕竟，太多事情可能会出错了。"

"I'm actually kinda surprised you wouldn't know how to pilot a helicopter or something."

"我其实有点惊讶你居然不会开直升机什么的。"

"No," said Asuka with a slight chuckle, "only an Evangelion. Though even that wouldn't help us in crossing the sea."

"不，"明日香轻笑道，"只会驾驶 EVA。不过即便那样，也无法帮我们渡海。"

While they continued standing there, the sun slowly began setting, painting the sea an orange hue. Two days ago, they had been on the other side of Japan, yet it still seemed like a completely different place from where they stood. The tall skyscrapers of Tokyo-2 seemed almost a different memory already.

他们继续站在那里，太阳缓缓西沉，将大海染成橙色。两天前，他们还在日本的另一端，但此刻所见之地仿佛全然不同。东京-2 的高楼大厦，似乎已成遥远的记忆。

"We should probably set up camp for the night," suggested Shinji.

"我们或许应该扎营过夜了。" 真嗣提议道。

"I suppose," Asuka said, agreeing with him.

"我想是的，" 明日香说道，同意了他的看法。

As they walked back to the car however, Shinji's gaze drifted over to the boats resting at the dock.

然而，当他们走回车旁时，真嗣的目光不由自主地飘向了停靠在码头的小船。

"Hey Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"How would you feel about sleeping on one of those tonight?"

"你觉得今晚睡在其中一个上面怎么样？"

Following the direction of where he was pointing, Asuka noticed the boats at the dock.

顺着他指的方向看去，明日香注意到了码头上的船只。

"That depends on whether they're simple fishermen's boats, or if they actually have a cabin to sleep in."

"那得看是简单的渔船，还是真的有船舱可以睡觉的那种。"

"It wouldn't hurt to check at least."

"至少检查一下也无妨。"

"No, it wouldn't I guess."

"是啊，我想不会有什么坏处。"

So instead of making there way back to the car, they turned to there right, and followed the path around until they set foot on the dock. The wooden planks that they stepped on floated in the water, but each was securely fastened to each other that there was no sense of suddenly falling off. The started stepping on the multiple boats, but most were as Asuka had said, and were simple fishermen's boats, and lacking a cabin of any kind. Shinji was about to suggest that they just head back to the car, or find a small house to spend the night in, when he heard Asuka calling him over.

于是，他们没有返回车上，而是向右转，沿着小路走到了码头。他们脚下的木板漂浮在水面上，但每块木板都牢固地连接在一起，没有突然掉下去的感觉。他们开始踏上多艘船只，但正如 Asuka 所说，大多数都是简单的渔船，没有任何类型的船舱。Shinji 正要提议他们返回车上，或者找一个小屋过夜，这时他听到 Asuka 在叫他过去。

"I found one," she said as he approached her, "that has a small cabin inside, along with a makeshift kitchen environment."

"我找到了一个，" 她在他走近时说道，"里面有个小木屋，还有一个简易的厨房环境。"

"Better than nothing I suppose," shrugged Shinji.

"总比没有强吧，" 真嗣耸耸肩说。"

Afterwards, they made several trips to the car and back, bringing stuff with them onto the boat. The blankets and pillows already on the boat, they placed in a small closet, and brought there own stuff inside. The bed was hardly any better than the cars backseat, but it was more comfortable at the very least.

之后，他们来回跑了好几趟，把东西从车上搬到船上。船上原有的毯子和枕头被放进了小柜子里，他们把自己的物品也搬了进去。床铺比起车子的后座好不了多少，但至少更舒适一些。

The makeshift kitchen had a mini fridge and a gasoline range attached to it, but there was no propane to start the range, and though Shinji dared to open the fridge, it turned out to be empty. Instead, they built a campfire on the beach, using the wood they had brought with them, and ate a small dinner, before retiring to the boat.

临时厨房里有一个迷你冰箱和一个连接在上面的汽油炉，但没有丙烷来启动炉子，尽管真嗣敢打开冰箱，却发现里面空空如也。于是，他们用带来的木柴在海滩上生起了篝火，简单地吃了晚餐，然后回到船上休息。

Climbing over the rope that blocked the entrance to the boat, they walked down the three steps that led into the cabin. Shinji was still in his shorts from earlier, and was wearing a t-shirt, so he didn't need to change in sleepwear. Asuka on the other hand, changed out of her clothes, and donned a pair of shorts, along with the tank top she had already been wearing. It had already dried, but just seeing it made Shinji remember Asuka's figure from earlier. He didn't need any problems right now, especially as he was about to sleep in the same bed as her, so he pushed that image to the far reaches of his mind.

他们跨过拦在船入口处的绳子，走下通往船舱的三级台阶。真嗣还穿着之前的短裤和 T 恤，所以不需要换睡衣。而明日香则换下了衣服，穿上了一条短裤和已经穿在身上的背心。虽然已经干了，但一看到它，真嗣就回想起之前明日香的身形。他现在不需要任何麻烦，尤其是即将和她睡在同一张床上，所以他将那个画面推到了脑海的遥远角落。

Climbing into the bed, and then throwing the covers over themselves, they both stared up at the oaken ceiling wordlessly, waiting for sleep to take them.

爬上床后，他们各自拉过被子盖好，默默地凝视着橡木天花板，等待睡意降临。

"This is probably one of the last places I would have imagined sleeping at," said Asuka, breaking the silence.

“这大概是我最想不到会用来睡觉的地方之一了，”明日香打破了沉默说道。

"Yeah," agreed Shinji quietly.

“是啊，”真嗣轻声同意道。

He suddenly felt tired, which was understandable, considering the things he had been through today. Closing his eyes, he felt himself drifting off to sleep, but he felt the mattress shift beside him, and then looked over to see Asuka turned towards him. She was smiling slightly, though it may have been a smirk at the same time.

他突然感到疲惫，考虑到今天经历的事情，这是可以理解的。闭上眼睛，他感觉自己渐渐入睡，但他感觉到身边的床垫动了动，然后转头看到明日香转向了他。她微微一笑，尽管那可能同时也是一种讥笑。

"What?" asked Shinji with a raised eyebrow.

“什么？” 真嗣挑起眉毛问道。

"Nothing," replied Asuka, the smile still not disappearing from her lips.

“没什么，” 明日香回答，笑容依旧未从唇边消失。

'What's up with her?' wondered Shinji. Asuka normally wasn't this lax about her attitude, or appearance towards Shinji. She hadn't even cared that he'd been in the same room with her as she changed.

“她怎么了？” 真嗣暗自思忖。明日香平时对态度和外表对真嗣不会这么随意。她甚至不在乎他在她换衣服时也在同一个房间里。

"If you say so," mumbled Shinji.

“你这么说的话，”真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka didn't know why, but she suddenly had the urge to pinch his noes after he said this. Trouble was, she didn't know why in the first place.

明日香不知道为什么，但听到他这么说后，她突然有种想捏他鼻子的冲动。麻烦的是，她一开始就不明白自己为何会有这种想法。

"Well, I'm going to sleep. Night Asuka."

“好了，我要睡了。晚安，明日香。”

Closing his eyes again, he slowly drifted off until the only sound filling the cabin was his light breathing. Asuka watched him for a while, debating whether to wake him up or not, but decided against it. He had a harrowing day afterall, so best to let him sleep she supposed.

他再次闭上眼睛，渐渐沉入梦乡，直到机舱内只剩下他轻柔的呼吸声。明日香注视了他一会儿，犹豫是否要叫醒他，但最终决定不打扰。毕竟他今天经历了那么多磨难，最好还是让他好好睡一觉，她想。

'Well, its not like I didn't have a long day either' thought Asuka. She reflected back to the traffic jam, and the moment when she thought she had lost him. For Asuka, she felt that her reaction had been uncanny, and rather exaggerated, completely unlike her normal self, or maybe it was better to say her past self. Shinji meant a lot to her, but when the apparent truth had begun to set in, only then did Asuka realize how much.

'好吧，我今天也过得很漫长。'明日香心想。她回想起那场交通堵塞，以及那一刻她以为要失去他的瞬间。对明日香来说，她的反应显得异常，甚至有些夸张，完全不像平时的她，或者说，不像过去的她。真嗣对她意义重大，但直到真相逐渐显现，明日香才意识到他对自己有多重要。

'A life without Shinji,' she wondered.

'没有真嗣的生活，'她思索着。

She couldn't imagine that, not now, not after everything they had been through, and the realization of her own feelings which were slowly starting to unconsciously take form by her actions and words. She still didn't know where they came from, but did that really matter at the same time?

她无法想象，不是现在，不是在他们经历了这一切之后，她对自己情感的认识正逐渐通过她的行为和言语无意识地形成。她仍然不知道这些情感从何而来，但与此同时，这真的重要吗？

'Jeez, what about this idiot made me start feeling like this,' she wondered with a slight sigh.

'天哪，这个傻瓜到底让我开始有了什么样的感觉，'她带着一丝叹息想道。

Glancing over at him, she frowned slightly, wondering what he would say if he wasn't fast asleep. Probably stutter rather bad, before silently accepting things.

她瞥了他一眼，微微皱眉，想知道如果他没有熟睡，他会说什么。大概会结巴得很厉害，然后默默接受一切。

Scooting a little closer to him, Asuka's face was about directly next to his so that she could feel his breath on her face. It was hot, needless to say, but this didn't really bother Asuka. She could feel her bare legs brushing against his own, and hoped that he wouldn't wake up because of this, but he still seemed fast asleep.

阿斯卡轻轻挪近他，脸颊几乎贴在他的旁边，能感受到他呼出的热气。不用说，这气息很热，但这并没有真正困扰到阿斯卡。她能感觉到自己赤裸的腿轻轻触碰着他的，希望这不会让他醒来，但他似乎仍然沉睡着。

Shinji was taller than Asuka, and his legs reached the end of the bed almost. Sliding further under the covers, Asuka found the headboard at the end of the bed, as well as the ends of Shinji's feet. At the same time, her head was about level with his chest.

真嗣比阿斯卡高，他的腿几乎伸到了床尾。阿斯卡滑进被子里，找到了床头板和真嗣脚的末端。与此同时，她的头差不多与他的胸口齐平。

'Why am I doing this?' wondered Asuka. It wasn't like just rolling over and falling asleep would be any different really. Still, she didn't stop, and ended up resting her face against Shinji's chest. A certain smell filled her nostrils which she had difficulty describing, but as best as she could, it was simply Shinji's smell.

'我为什么要这么做？' 明日香心想。其实，翻个身直接睡着也没什么不同。然而，她并未停下，最终将脸颊贴在了真嗣的胸膛上。一种难以言喻的气味充斥着她的鼻腔，尽管她难以描述，但最贴切的说法，那就是真嗣的气味。

It was certainly warmer, sleeping next to Shinji like this that was, but Asuka still felt like something wasn't right. She wasn't entirely sure whether to keep her hands at chest height, or down near her waist, but even that didn't seem like the problem.

与真嗣这样依偎而眠确实更温暖，但明日香仍觉得有些不对劲。她不确定双手是该放在胸前还是腰际，但似乎这也不是问题的关键。

Suddenly, and whether by accident, or if he had truly been awake this whole time, Shinji's right hand, which had been resting at his side before, suddenly found itself draped over Asuka's shoulder, and down behind the small of her back. She had to stifle a shocked yelp, as in the process his hand brushed against a rather sensitive spot on her body, but the feeling quickly passed. His hand was lax, but even Asuka couldn't help but quietly whisper his name, wondering if he had been awake this entire time. If he was, she may just punch him roughly for quietly accepting all this, and making her feel embarrassed. He didn't stir as she called him however, and his breathing didn't change at all, making her suspect it was all happenstance.

突然间，不知是意外还是他其实一直醒着，原本垂在身侧的 Shinji 的右手，竟悄然搭在了 Asuka 的肩上，并顺势滑至她腰际。她不得不强忍住一声惊呼，因为他的手在过程中触碰到了她身体上一个颇为敏感的部位，但那感觉转瞬即逝。他的手虽松弛无力，但 Asuka 仍忍不住轻声呼唤他的名字，心中疑惑他是否真的全程清醒。若他真醒着，她或许会狠狠揍他一顿，为他的默然接受和让她感到的尴尬。然而，当她呼唤他时，他并未有任何反应，呼吸也丝毫未变，这让她怀疑这一切不过是巧合。

'This idiot,' she thought, rather annoyed at him, and suddenly having a desire to break away from sleeping next to him. In the end, she gave in to the comfort of what she was experiencing, and slowly fell asleep beside him.

'这个傻瓜，' 她心想，对他颇为恼火，突然间有了想要挣脱与他同床共枕的冲动。最终，她屈服于所经历的舒适感，慢慢地在他身旁睡着了。

(Okay, prepare for long author note)

(好吧，准备迎接长篇作者笔记)

First of, I'll talk a bit about this chapter I guess. So I said before that so far we have gone through about 2/3rds of the first half of Two of Us, and are now entering the final part of the first half. As is apparent with this chapter, this next 3rd is going to be focusing on Shinji and Asuka's growing relationship, so don't be surprised to see things taking a more mature turn with regards to their relationship. With more explicit stuff (which is still a long ways off) I'll of course be inserting authors notes for people who don't want to read that kinda stuff.

首先，我想谈谈这个chapter，大概是这样的。之前我说过，到目前为止，我们已经经历了《我们俩》前半部分的约三分之二，现在正进入前半部分的最后阶段。从这个chapter可以看出，接下来的三分之一将聚焦于真嗣和明日香关系的发展，所以不要惊讶于他们的关系会变得更加成熟。至于更露骨的内容（那还早得很），我当然会插入作者笔记，供不想阅读这类内容的人参考。

On to other stuff. So, in a nut shell, after my big December updates, I decided it was about time I seriously started searching for a job. That basically ate up all my time in February, and most of March, before I finally got hired and started working in April. During that time, it was basically work/come home and play video games, or do absolutely nothing. Honestly, I had kinda forgotten about this for a while, but I've started reading again during this past month, and decided it was about damn time I get off my ass and work on this again.

接下来谈谈其他事情。简而言之，经过去年十二月的大更新后，我决定是时候认真开始找工作了。这基本上占据了二月份的全部时间，以及三月份的大部分时间，直到四月份我终于被录用并开始工作。那段时间里，生活基本就是工作、回家玩游戏，或者干脆什么都不做。说实话，我有一阵子几乎忘了这回事，但最近一个月我又开始阅读了，并觉得是时候该振作起来，重新投入这项工作了。

Finally, and I mentioned it briefly in Birthday Without Surprises (It'll get done someday) I got a couple things I wanna say. First, once Two of Us is done, I'm likely done with Shinji/Asuka and fanfiction in general. I may write a couple quick one-shots, but I won't be writing super long stories like this and SOA. Second, and this is basically why the first one exists, I want to step out of the fanfiction world, and start creating my own material. Back in August of last year, I started doing that, and began creating my own book which is pushing about eighty pages currently. Since then, I've come up with two other ideas for books, and began writing another one.

最后，我在《生日无惊喜》中简要提过（总有一天会完成的），我有几件事想说。首先，一旦《我们俩》完结，我可能就会告别碇真嗣/惣流·明日香·兰格雷以及同人小说领域。或许会写几篇短篇，但不会再投入像这样或《源起之日》那般长篇大论的创作。其次，这也正是第一点存在的原因，我想走出同人圈，开始创作自己的作品。去年八月，我便开始了这一尝试，着手撰写自己的书，目前页数已近八十。自那以后，我又萌生了两个新的书稿构思，并开始了另一部作品的创作。

I gotta say though, if not for everybody that has reviewed my work, followed it, favorite it, or sent me pms asking me to hurry the F$ck up and finish this, I probably wouldn't have even considered creating my own work. So I'd just like to say thanks to everybody, and hope that you see this story through to the end, and anything else that I may create in the future. Thanks a bunch Everyone!

不过我得说，若非那些评论我的作品、关注它、收藏它，或是发私信催我赶紧完结的朋友们，我大概根本不会考虑创作自己的作品。所以我想对大家说声谢谢，希望你们能见证这个故事走到最后，以及未来我可能创作的任何其他作品。非常感谢大家！

(And as if this wasn't long winded enough, monthly updates will begin again, since I work graveyard and have the entire morning ahead of me)

(而且似乎这还不够冗长，月度更新将重新开始，因为我上夜班，整个上午都有空闲时间)

### Chapter 21: Desire

Blame Destiny for this being late.

---

When Asuka woke up the next morning, it took her several seconds to recognize what the warm pressure was resting against her back, and the distinct smell that was filling her nostrils. It seemed that she had remained beside Shinji the whole night, and more importantly, within his arms, or arm, as it happened to be.

当明日香第二天早上醒来时，她花了好几秒钟才意识到抵在她背上的温暖压力是什么，以及充斥在她鼻腔里的独特气味。看来她整晚都留在真嗣身边，更重要的是，在他的怀抱中，或者说，在他的手臂中，事实如此。

Tilting her head upwards, she saw that he was still sleeping deeply. She was surprised that he hadn't shifted positions the whole night, but that just went to show how tired he was yesterday. Still, she didn't plan on staying like this until he got up either. Praying that she wouldn't wake him, she gently removed his arm that was wrapped around her back, and then sat up slowly, being careful that the blankets wouldn't shift much. She seemed to do an adequate job at least, because Shinji didn't stir in the least.

她抬头望去，只见他依旧沉沉睡着。她惊讶于他整夜未曾变换姿势，这恰恰说明了他昨日的疲惫。不过，她也没打算就这样一直等到他醒来。祈祷着不会吵醒他，她轻轻移开他环绕在她背上的手臂，然后缓缓坐起，小心不让毯子大幅度移动。至少她似乎做得还不错，因为真嗣丝毫没有动弹。

The cabin was dark and without windows, so it took Asuka several seconds of stumbling around in the dark, before she was able to find the latch to the outside world above.

小屋内昏暗无窗，因此明日香在黑暗中摸索了几秒钟，才找到通往外界的门闩。

The hatch opened, and sunlight poured down on her, and she was temporarily blinded while her eyes adjusted to the piercing light. The sun was already fairly high in the sky, so they must have slept longer than intended. Asuka was tempted to go back down and wake Shinji because of this, but she decided to let him sleep a while longer.

舱门打开，阳光倾泻而下，她一时被刺眼的光线晃得睁不开眼。太阳已经升得相当高，看来他们睡得比预期要久。明日香有些想回去叫醒真嗣，但最终决定让他再多睡一会儿。

She wasn't very hungry, but made breakfast all the same, setting aside a portion for Shinji. She stayed on the stern of the ship, which had a single chair for someone to look out across the water from where they sat. Several more boats were in a line behind this one, but to Asuka's right, the beach stretched out before her, clear up the coast until it disappeared into the horizon. The ocean breeze made her hair dance behind her, and the salt felt refreshing as she breathed it in.

她并不怎么饿，但还是照常做了早餐，给真嗣留了一份。她待在船尾，那里有一把椅子供人坐下眺望水面。几艘船排在这艘船后面，但在明日香右边，沙滩一直延伸到海岸线消失在天际。海风让她的头发在身后飘舞，吸入的盐分感觉清新怡人。

She quickly grew bored however, and began walking along the dock, examining the other ships. In truth, they had only looked at about half the boats here, and a lot of them were only fishing boats without a cabin, which was obvious at a glance. Still, you never knew would could be found. Asuka seriously doubted if they would ever need to worry about fishing for food, but there were plenty of fishing poles to choose from if they ever wanted one.

然而，她很快就感到无聊，开始沿着码头散步，检查其他船只。实际上，他们只看了一半左右的船，其中许多只是没有船舱的渔船，一眼就能看出来。不过，你永远不知道会发现什么。明日香严重怀疑他们是否需要担心捕鱼为食，但如果他们想要，这里有很多钓竿可供选择。

Each boat had a name plastered on the side in large black letters, either spelling out the owners name, or the company associated with the boat. As Asuka stepped onto a sail boat owned by a R. Takamichi, she glanced around at her surroundings. The sails were furled, and the boat was rather large, appearing to have its own cabin. Opening the hatch that led below, Asuka found a cabin that was slightly larger than their own, with a small dining area included. There wasn't much to speak of that she found useful however, that is, until she opened the mini fridge at least. Well, useful wouldn't quite be the right word either, but Asuka would be lying if she said she wasn't curious at least.

每艘船的侧面都用大黑字贴着名字，要么是船主的名字，要么是与船相关的公司名。当明日香踏上 R.高道所有的一艘帆船时，她环顾了一下四周。船帆已经收起，船身相当大，似乎还有自己的船舱。打开通往下面的舱口，明日香发现了一个比他们自己的稍大的船舱，还带有一个小餐厅。虽然她没找到什么特别有用的东西，但至少在她打开迷你冰箱之前是这样。好吧，说有用可能不太准确，但如果说她一点好奇心都没有，那她就是在撒谎。

Grabbing what she found, she walked back to the boat they had slept in, and sat back down at her spot on the stern. Glancing down at the case which she found, she remembered a moment back in December shared between herself and Shinji, and the dinner she had cooked that night. It would be different certainly, but it wouldn't hurt to try it at least, and it wasn't like there was anybody to tell her not to.

她拿起找到的东西，走回他们睡觉的那艘船，坐在船尾自己的位置上。低头看着她找到的箱子，她想起了去年十二月和真嗣共度的那个夜晚，以及那晚她做的晚餐。当然，这次会有所不同，但尝试一下也无妨，而且也没有人会阻止她。

Shinji couldn't remember when he had last slept so peacefully. In Tokyo-2 when they had been living at their house, he would usually wake up early, and go to sleep early. Even then, he would occasionally wake up in the middle of the night, or toss and turn constantly, waiting to fall asleep. He had fallen asleep almost instantly last night, and couldn't remember dreaming anything either. The one thing missing of course was Asuka. Shinji wasn't surprised to see that she was already awake, as he had a feeling he had slept in rather late.

真嗣记不清自己上次如此安稳地入睡是什么时候了。在东京-2 时，他们住在家里，他通常会早起早睡。即便如此，他偶尔也会在半夜醒来，或者辗转反侧，等待入睡。昨晚他几乎一躺下就睡着了，而且也不记得做了什么梦。当然，唯一缺少的就是明日香。真嗣并不惊讶地看到她已经醒了，因为他有种自己睡过头的感觉。

Sitting up, he tossed the blankets to the side and made his way to the hatch leading to the deck. After opening it and stepping out into the sun, he was greeted by a very strange sound. The words escaped him, as he didn't know what they were, but the sound itself was pleasant. Following the melancholic sound, Shinji stepped around to the side of deck, and walked towards the stern. The words and melody filled his ears, and he slowly realized that it was a song of sorts, though the language wasn't English or Japanese.

他坐起身，把毯子扔到一边，走向通往甲板的舱口。打开舱口，踏入阳光中，他被一种非常奇怪的声音迎接。他说不出那是什么词，因为他不知道，但声音本身很悦耳。随着那忧郁的声音，真嗣绕到甲板的一侧，走向船尾。词语和旋律充斥着他的耳朵，他慢慢意识到那是一种歌曲，尽管语言既不是英语也不是日语。

Shinji knew that only one person could be in his vicinity, and so he wasn't a terribly surprised when he found Asuka. She was sitting on the edge of the stern, her legs swung outward and over the water, her gaze stretching out towards the beach. The song Shinji still didn't understand, but the words he finally recognized as German. He often forgot that Asuka was of mixed blood, but this was the first time he had actually heard her speak any German. Her words washed over him like a wave, and he just stood there and listened to her quietly singing. The song seemed both happy and sad at the same time, but since Shinji didn't know the words, he couldn't know for certain what was being said.

真嗣知道，在他周围的人只有一个，所以当他发现明日香时，并不感到特别惊讶。她坐在船尾边缘，双腿悬空，目光投向海滩。那首歌真嗣仍然无法理解，但歌词他终于辨认出是德语。他常常忘记明日香是混血儿，但这却是他第一次真正听到她说德语。她的歌声如波浪般涌向他，他只是静静地站在那里聆听。这首歌似乎同时充满了喜悦与悲伤，但由于真嗣不懂歌词，他无法确切知道在唱些什么。

As her voice finally grew quieter, and then tapered off on a final note, Shinji nearly felt like clapping. Instead, he settled for just calling out to her.

当她的声音终于渐渐减弱，最后在一个尾音上消失时，真嗣几乎有种鼓掌的冲动。不过，他最终只是向她喊了一声。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

To her credit, Asuka wasn't startled by this sudden interruption. She was too lost in her own thoughts for that right now.

值得称赞的是，明日香并没有被这突如其来的打断吓到。此刻她正沉浸在自己的思绪中，无暇顾及这些。

"Hmm? Oh, Shinji? Did you just wake up?"

“嗯？哦，真嗣？你刚醒吗？”

"Yeah, and that was really good. I think thats the first time I've heard you speak German, though I don't really understand German at all, but it was still beautiful nonetheless."

“是啊，真的很棒。我想这是我第一次听你说德语，虽然我完全不懂德语，但听起来依然很美。”

Asuka's cheeks turned a light shade a pink as he said this, but she shrugged it away.

听到这话，绫波的脸颊泛起了一抹淡淡的粉红，但她随即耸了耸肩，将这抹羞涩抛诸脑后。

"It was an old piece written during the 19th century. It just sorta came to me all the sudden I guess."

“这是 19 世纪的一首旧作。我猜，它突然间就浮现在我脑海里了吧。”

"What's it about?" “这首诗讲的是什么？”

In truth, Asuka didn't want to tell him. She had spent a good deal thinking about Shinji while she sat there, and the turmoil that was going through her heart, and suddenly she remembered that old piece. Where she had heard it though, she couldn't remember. Maybe it had been her mother, but she really couldn't say.

实际上，明日香并不想告诉他。她坐在那里，花了很多时间思考真嗣，以及她内心的纷乱，突然间她想起了那首老歌。尽管她记不清是在哪里听到的，也许是她母亲，但她真的说不准。

Before she could come up with a lie however, Shinji said something else that completely negated his previous question.

然而，在她能编出一个谎言之前，真嗣说了些别的话，完全否定了他之前的问题。

"That isn't beer, is it Asuka?"

“那不是啤酒吧，是吗，明日香？”

His gaze was pointed towards the case that Asuka had retrieved from the other boat earlier. It was Japanese beer, a twelve pack, and completely untouched, except for the one beer that Asuka had beside her.

他的目光直指着明日香从另一艘船上取来的那箱啤酒。那是日本啤酒，一打装，完好无损，除了明日香身边的那一瓶。

"So what if it is? Its not like I'm drunk."

"那又怎样？我又没喝醉。"

"Even so, drinking at our age is-"

"即便如此，在我们这个年纪喝酒还是——"

"We both had wine during Christmas, so its not like this is wrong or anything."

"圣诞节时我们都喝过葡萄酒，所以这也没什么不对的。"

"That was a special occasion, and besides, you still have to drive."

"那是个特殊场合，而且你还得开车。"

"Oh shut it Shinji," groaned Asuka angrily.

"哦，闭嘴吧，真嗣，" 明日香生气地咕哝道。

One second, she couldn't contain the emotions raging inside her, and the next, she was acting abrasive towards him. She wished she could just be honest with, but when he made stupid comments like that, it made her angry.

前一秒，她还在努力压抑内心的情感风暴，下一秒，她就对他变得尖锐起来。她希望自己能坦诚相待，但当他像那样说出愚蠢的话时，她就会感到愤怒。

Shinji looked like he wanted to continue the discussion, but Asuka gave the impression that it was over. Instead, he turned to other matters.

真嗣看起来还想继续讨论，但明日香给人的感觉是已经结束了。于是，他转向了其他事情。

"Have you thought about where we go from here?" he asked.

“你考虑过我们接下来去哪儿吗？”他问道。

"I have," nodded Asuka. While she had been waiting around on the boat for Shinji to awake, she had given the subject a good deal of thought.

“我考虑过了，”明日香点头道。在船上等待真嗣醒来的时候，她已经对这个话题进行了深入的思考。

"Driving farther north along the coast doesn't seem to serve much purpose, but south may be different."

"沿着海岸继续向北行驶似乎没什么意义，但向南可能会有所不同。"

"How do you figure?" "你怎么看？"

"Do you know anything about your own country?"

"你对你的国家了解多少？"

Shinji let that slide, but he understood what she was getting at.

真嗣没有反驳，但他明白她的意思。

"So you figure there will be more towns or cities if we go further south?"

"所以你认为如果我们继续向南走，会遇到更多的城镇或城市？"

"From what I can tell, nearly everything north of here is going to be farmland, with the occasional small town. South may be different, and I was hoping you had some insight into that."

据我所知，这里以北几乎全是农田，零星点缀着些小镇。南方可能有所不同，我本希望你能提供一些见解。

"Well, most of Japan's coastal cities were abandoned after Second Impact," started Shinji, "which doesn't leave much inland. Cities like Osaka, Kobe, Fukuyama, and Hiroshima are completely underwater. I suppose parts of Nagoya are okay, and Kyoto is still fine."

“嗯，第二次冲击后，日本大部分沿海城市都被废弃了，”真嗣开始说道，“这使得内陆地区所剩无几。像大阪、神户、福山和广岛这样的城市已经完全被水淹没。我想名古屋的部分地区还行，京都依然完好无损。”

"I thought we decided not to live in a large city."

"我以为我们决定不住在大城市里。"

"I know, but if we do decide to stay at one place, having a city within driving distance will be important. I've never been to Kyoto before, but if we find a a small town outside the city, it shouldn't take us longer than forty-five, to an hour to go shopping if we need to."

"我知道，但如果我们真的决定在一个地方安定下来，附近有个城市会很重要。我以前没去过京都，但如果我们在城外找个小镇，需要购物时开车应该不会超过四十五分钟到一个小时。"

"You forget that I'm the one driving."

"你忘了是我开的车。"

"It's not like I wouldn't go with you. What am I suppose to do, wait around the house until you come back?"

"我又不是不愿意跟你去。难道我应该在家里等着你回来吗？"

Talking in this fashion felt strange, as though they had already decided the exact town and place they were going to live at.

这样说话感觉很奇怪，仿佛他们已经决定了要去哪个城镇、住在哪个地方。

"Either way," said Shinji, "we aren't making any progress by just standing here and arguing."

"不管怎样，" 真嗣说，"我们站在这里争论是不会有任何进展的。"

"True," agreed Asuka. "确实，"明日香同意道。

Taking a final sip from her beer can, just gave it a rather disgruntled look, before chucking it over the side of the boat. She almost wished it was still snowing. At least then she'd be able to keep the case cool somehow. Either way, she picked up what remained of the case, and carried it passed Shinji.

她从啤酒罐中喝下最后一口，不满地瞥了一眼，然后把它扔到了船外。她几乎希望还在下雪。那样至少她能设法让箱子保持凉爽。无论如何，她拿起剩下的箱子，从真嗣身边走过。

"We should start packing up if we are going south then. It'll take us probably a day an a half before we reach Kyoto, if that is where we're headed."

"如果我们要南下，那就该开始收拾了。可能需要一天半的时间才能到达京都，如果那是我们的目的地的话。"

"It's a start," said Shinji.

"总算是个开始。" 真嗣说道。

"It's better than staying here I suppose."

"总比呆在这里强，我想。"

Though the ocean breeze was pleasant, and being next to a beach again was nice, they didn't have any way of restocking supplies. As Shinji had said, where ever they decided to stay next, it needed to be close enough to a supermarket.

尽管海风宜人，再次靠近海滩的感觉也不错，但他们没有任何补给物资的途径。正如真嗣所说，无论他们决定接下来住在哪里，都必须离超市足够近。

It didn't take them long to pack everything back inside the car, and shortly after, they were leaving the small fishing village behind. They rolled the windows down and enjoyed the ocean air as they drove. Asuka had decided that driving farther south along the coast would be far faster instead of driving back towards Tokyo-2 and continuing south from there. This way, they were far less likely to run into another traffic jam of abandoned cars.

没过多久，他们就把所有东西重新装回了车里，很快便离开了那个小渔村。他们摇下车窗，享受着海风，驱车前行。明日香决定沿着海岸线继续向南行驶，这样会比返回东京-2 再向南快得多。这样一来，他们遇到另一段废弃车辆造成的交通堵塞的可能性就小得多了。

The sun was directly above them, making it close to, or slightly after noon at this point. They didn't talk much as they drove, but Asuka found her eyes wandering to Shinji occasionally. He seemed not to notice however, and was spending most of his time staring out at the Sea of Japan on their right.

太阳正悬头顶，此时应是接近或刚过正午时分。他们驾车时话不多，但 Asuka 偶尔会发现自己的目光游移到 Shinji 身上。然而，他似乎并未察觉，大部分时间都在凝视着右侧的日本海。

Two months ago, while walking outside on a cold winter morning, she had finally come to recognize her feelings for the boy riding shotgun next to her. Since then though, she had neither acted on those feelings, nor honestly felt anything different until this moment. Why was it, that within those two months, that nothing had happened? Was it because she was too comfortable with the living environment at the time? Now that that environment had changed, was she now more aware of those feelings? Did she even want things to change?

两个月前，在一个寒冷的冬日早晨散步时，她终于意识到自己对坐在副驾驶座的男孩的感情。尽管如此，自那以后她既未采取行动，也未真正感受到任何不同，直到此刻。为何在这两个月里，什么都没有发生？是因为当时的生活环境太过舒适吗？如今环境已变，她是否因此更意识到这些情感？她甚至希望事情有所改变吗？

Asuka had battled with that question multiple times, and still hadn't come to a suitable answer. She wasn't afraid for Shinji's response. But what would, and what wouldn't change? Change could be both a wonderful, and a very frightening thing. Their relationship had started out as one of bickering and borderline loathing, and slowly turned from passive acceptance, to finally friendship. Taking it a step further after friendship would mean...

明日香已经多次与这个问题斗争，却仍未找到合适的答案。她并不担心真嗣的反应。但什么会改变，什么不会改变呢？改变既可以是美妙的，也可能是非常可怕的。他们的关系起初充满了争吵和近乎厌恶，逐渐从被动接受转变为最终的友谊。在友谊的基础上再进一步意味着……

Asuka bit her lips furiously, unwillingly thinking about such things. Did she want Shinji in such a way? Was that the way she was looking at him now? He was scrawny, unattractive, boring, a pushover, and somebody who if she had seen him while just walking on the streets, she wouldn't have given him a second glance.

明日香狠狠地咬着嘴唇，不情愿地思考着这些事情。她是否希望真嗣以这种方式存在？她现在看他的方式是这样的吗？他瘦弱、不吸引人、无聊、容易屈服，如果只是在街上偶然遇见他，她可能都不会多看一眼。

But he was also kind, caring, friendly towards her, and had a certain stubbornness to himself which she didn't hate. Above all else though, he genuinely cared for her well being. Not many people had ever truly cared about her. At home, she had been neglected by her father, shunned by the people in her college, and even at Nerv, been nothing more than the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02. She had cared about that, and had been thrilled to have been chosen of course, but in the end, what was she really? Just a teenage girl that hadn't had anywhere else to go.

但他对她也温柔、体贴、友善，还有些固执，这点她并不讨厌。最重要的是，他真心关心她的福祉。真正关心她的人并不多。在家里，她被父亲忽视，在大学里被人们排斥，甚至在 Nerv，她也不过是二号机驾驶员。她对此在意，当然也为被选中而兴奋，但归根结底，她究竟是什么？不过是一个无处可去的少女罢了。

Now though, things were different. Her place was right here beside him.

但现在，情况不同了。她的位置就在他身边。

"That still doesn't answer anything," mumbled Asuka, not aware that she was speaking aloud.

“那还是没有回答任何问题，”明日香喃喃自语，没意识到自己说出了声。

"You say something Asuka?" asked Shinji.

“你说什么了吗，明日香？”真嗣问道。

Asuka jerked the wheel suddenly, surprised that she had spoken her thoughts, but quickly corrected her driving.

明日香突然猛打方向盘，惊讶于自己竟说出了心里话，但很快又调整了驾驶。

"What was that about?" wondered Shinji.

“那是什么情况？”真嗣疑惑道。

"Nothing," growled Asuka, determined not to look at him.

“没什么，”明日香低吼道，决心不朝他看去。

"If you say so," shrugged Shinji, returning to his absentminded gazing out the window.

"如果你这么说的话，" 真嗣耸了耸肩，继续心不在焉地望着窗外。

Asuka's eyes remained fixed on both him and the road for a while, before she returned her full attention to the road.

明日香的双眼一直盯着他和道路，过了一会儿，她才将全部注意力转回到路上。

'Why does he make me feel so uncomfortable at times,' wondered Asuka.

'为什么他有时让我感觉这么不舒服呢，' 明日香暗自思忖。

They drove most of the day, only stopping once for a quick break, since Asuka was beginning to complain about the long drive. As the sun began to set though, Asuka decided to call it quits, and found a small parking lot on the right side, overlooking the beach and the Sea of Japan.

他们大部分时间都在开车，只停下来快速休息了一次，因为明日香开始抱怨长途驾驶。然而，随着太阳开始落山，明日香决定结束行程，找到了一个位于右侧的小停车场，可以俯瞰海滩和日本海。

Stepping out of the car, she stretched first, and then looked over at Shinji, who was grabbing a couple things out of the backseat, and something which Asuka had rather been dreading.

她走出车外，首先伸了个懒腰，然后看向真嗣，他正在从后座拿一些东西，还有一样让明日香相当担心的事情。

"You plan on setting that thing up?" asked Asuka pointedly when she saw the tent.

“你打算搭那个东西吗？”明日香看到帐篷时直截了当地问。

"I had...do you not want to?"

"我以为...你不想吗？"

"We're only staying here the one night," said Asuka. Though that wasn't the real reason. Being enclosed within a tent with Shinji the entire night had a certain ring to it that Asuka wasn't sure she liked. Or maybe it was the opposite of that?

"我们只在这里住一晚，"明日香说。虽然这不是真正的原因。整晚和真嗣一起待在帐篷里，有种说不出的感觉，明日香不确定自己是否喜欢。或者，也许恰恰相反？

"Well, if you don't want to," shrugged Shinji.

"好吧，如果你不想的话，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"No, its fine," said Asuka. She didn't sound like it was fine, but Shinji didn't question her further.

"不，没关系，" 明日香说道。她的语气听起来并不像没事，但真嗣没有进一步追问。

'Somethings wrong with her, but I haven't a clue as to what,' thought Shinji as he watched her walk down the steep steps to the beach below.

'她有些不对劲，但我完全不知道是什么原因，' 真嗣一边想一边看着她走下陡峭的台阶，向海滩走去。

It took Shinji far longer to set up the tent than he had intended. When they used it continuously during those first few weeks in Tokyo-2, he probably could have set it up and torn it down while blindfolded. Now, he was having a hard enough time just getting it to stand upright, and the wind didn't help either, nor Asuka's quiet muttering under her breath.

搭建帐篷花费了真嗣比预期长得多的时间。在东京-2 最初的几周里，他们连续使用帐篷时，他或许闭着眼睛都能搭好又拆掉。如今，他费了好大劲才让它立稳，风也不帮忙，还有明日香在一旁低声嘀咕，更是雪上加霜。

After a while, he found a spot in the sand next to the embankment which was closer to dirt, and was able to set it up satisfactory, without worrying about it falling over. He decided to use the driftwood that lay scattered around the beach instead of their own supply of firewood, which was slowly dwindling. Hopefully this would be their last night sleeping like this at least.

过了一会儿，他在堤坝旁的沙地上找到了一块更接近泥土的地方，终于顺利搭好了帐篷，不用担心它会倒下。他决定利用海滩上散落的浮木，而不是他们日渐减少的木柴储备。希望这至少是他们最后一晚这样露宿。

Dinner was a rushed affair, and at some point while Shinji was packing everything away, Asuka had disappeared from the campfire, but he could see her distant figure walking the length of the beach. Well, she seemed to have been preoccupied most of the day, so Shinji left her alone.

晚餐匆匆忙忙，就在真嗣收拾东西的时候，明日香已经从篝火旁消失了，但他能看到她沿着海滩远去的身影。嗯，她似乎一整天都心事重重，所以真嗣决定不打扰她。

With time to himself, he brought out the map and studied it. In actual fact, they could continue on this highway which snaked along the northern coast of Japan, before dipping slightly south and connecting with the main freeway which would take them into Kyoto. There was a good possibility that when they got closer, traffic would get bad again, but that was a problem for tomorrow. Shinji would have liked a more detailed map of Kyoto, since he had never been there before, but once they got there, it shouldn't be very difficult to find a tourist shop or something. It was the old capital of imperial Japan afterall, and a popular stop for people visiting the country.

有了空闲时间，他拿出地图仔细研究。实际上，他们可以继续沿着这条蜿蜒于日本北海岸的高速公路前行，稍向南拐后连接到通往京都的主干道。接近目的地时，交通很可能会再次拥堵，但这已是明日之忧。真嗣希望能有一份更详细的京都地图，毕竟他从未去过那里，但一旦抵达，找个旅游商店之类的应该不难。京都毕竟是日本旧都，也是游客常去的热门地点。

Besides actually arriving in the city, making a decision about where to live seemed more difficult. Living right in the middle of the city was out of the question, but outside the city boundaries was probably nearer towards what they were looking for. Again, Shinji wished he had a more detailed map showing the outlining country area.

除了实际抵达这座城市，决定居住地点似乎更为棘手。住在市中心根本不在考虑范围内，但城郊或许更接近他们所寻求的环境。再次地，真嗣希望自己能有一张更详尽的地图，展示周边乡村地区的情况。

While he continued glancing over at the map, he heard the soft crunch of footsteps, signaling the return of Asuka. Looking up at her from where he sat, he wasn't sure whether he sensed something wrong in her expression, or...something else. She wasn't angry, but she didn't seem happy either, or maybe it was bothered.

当他继续不时瞥向地图时，听到了轻微的脚步声碾压声，预示着明日香回来了。他从坐着的地方抬头看她，不确定自己是否从她的表情中察觉到了什么不对劲，或是...别的什么。她没有生气，但看起来也不高兴，或许是有困扰。

"Asuka, you seem to have been preoccupied all day. Is something wrong?"

"明日香，你今天一整天都心不在焉的。是有什么事吗？"

Asuka opened her mouth to say something, but couldn't find the words to describe what she was feeling at the moment. Instead, she wordlessly closed her mouth, and sat down next to Shinji. He glanced at her for a moment, before launching into a one sided conversation about his considerations about Kyoto. He may have been talking to a mirror for all the interaction he received from Asuka.

明日香张口欲言，却找不到合适的词句来描述此刻的心情。她默默地闭上嘴，挨着真嗣坐下。他瞥了她一眼，随即自顾自地谈起了对京都的种种考虑。他这番话或许对着镜子说也无甚区别，因为从明日香那里得到的回应寥寥无几。

Finally, after he was done speaking, he set the map beside him, and then turned towards Asuka, determined to get her to open up. She was already looking at him, and Shinji was momentarily distracted by this, not realizing that she had gotten closer to him, so that their shoulders were now touching. But more than that, their was something in Asuka's eyes as she stared into his own that Shinji didn't know what to make of. What was she thinking exactly as she stared at him?

终于，在他讲完后，他将地图放在一旁，然后转向明日香，决心让她敞开心扉。她已经在看着他了，这让真嗣一时分心，没有意识到她已经靠得更近，以至于他们的肩膀现在紧贴在一起。但更重要的是，明日香凝视着他时，眼中似乎有着某种他无法理解的东西。她这样盯着他，究竟在想些什么呢？

"...Asuka?" “……明日香？”

She didn't reply, but the distance between them seemed to shorten, and Shinji could easily count all of her eyelashes now. He was becoming incredibly aware of how close they were now, and was feeling uncomfortable. Her eyes were still locked with his, and their seemed to be something questioning within them now, but Shinji could make heads of tails of what it meant. This was completely unlike the Asuka which he had known before. Had something happened while she was walking the beach to bring on this strange behavior?

她没有回答，但两人之间的距离似乎在缩短，真嗣现在可以轻易数清她的每一根睫毛。他越来越意识到他们靠得有多近，感到有些不自在。她的目光依旧紧锁着他的，眼中似乎带着某种疑问，但真嗣完全摸不着头脑。这与之前他所认识的明日香截然不同。难道她在海滩上散步时发生了什么，导致了这种奇怪的行为？

As she drew closer, Shinji could now feel her soft breath on his face. It had a certain sweetness to it that filled his nostrils, but he still couldn't understand what she was doing. Was she toying with him again, and teasing him? Or was this something else?

当她越来越近时，真嗣能感觉到她轻柔的呼吸拂过他的脸庞。那气息带着一丝甜味，充盈在他的鼻腔，但他仍不明白她在做什么。她又在戏弄他，逗弄他吗？还是别的什么？

"Asuka...what are you doing?" Shinji asked far too bluntly for the current situation. Something within Asuka's eyes seemed to hesitate for a brief moment as he said that, but finally he got a reply.

“明日香……你在做什么？”真嗣在当前的情境下问得过于直白了。在他问出这句话时，明日香的眼中似乎闪过一丝犹豫，但最终他得到了回答。

"Shinji...do you...?" “真嗣……你……？”

Asuka's words broke, but her eyes still remained fixed on his. Slowly, it began to dawn on Shinji what was suddenly happening, and he didn't know how to reply.

明日香的话语中断了，但她的目光依旧紧紧锁定在他身上。渐渐地，真嗣开始明白突然发生了什么，而他不知道该如何回应。

So, instead, he turned away from her.

于是，他转过身去，避开了她。

Silence engulfed them, and Asuka's cheeks began to turn a certain shade of red, and Shinji's own had already changed color. It was an awkward moment between them, and neither knew how to remedy the situation. But Asuka seemed to have reached her limit of frustration, since she stood up, and walked quickly over to the tent.

沉默笼罩着他们，明日香的脸颊开始泛起一抹红晕，而真嗣的脸色也早已变了。这是他们之间尴尬的一刻，两人都不知如何化解这局面。但明日香似乎已达到了她的忍耐极限，因为她站起身，快步走向帐篷。

"Asuka, I-" tried Shinji, but she wasn't listening. Tugging open the tent flap, she kneeled down, and crawled inside, before quickly zipping it closed.

“明日香，我——” 真嗣试图开口，但她根本没在听。她拉开帐篷的帘子，跪下爬了进去，随即迅速拉上拉链。

The fire was still burning, and Shinji stared into it a long time, coming to grips with what had just transpired. He had a sudden urge to rip apart the sand with his AT-field, an urge which he hadn't felt in a while, but he had to calm himself down. It wasn't Asuka's fault, but Shinji wasn't sure whether he could blame himself either. It had happened far too sudden afterall.

篝火仍在燃烧，真嗣凝视着它许久，努力消化刚刚发生的一切。他突然有种用 AT 力场撕裂沙地的冲动，这种感觉他已经很久没有过了，但他必须让自己冷静下来。这不是明日香的错，但真嗣也不确定自己是否能责怪自己。毕竟，这一切发生得太突然了。

'Did she really intend on...' thought Shinji blankly. What else could it have been though? And why had Shinji reacted that way? It wasn't as though it was something he didn't want. Quite the contrary really. But suddenly being thrust into that situation; his brain didn't have enough time to comprehend what was happening, and then he had turned away from her.

“她真的打算……” 真嗣茫然地想。除此之外还能是什么呢？而真嗣为何会有那样的反应？这并非他不愿意的事。恰恰相反。但突然被推入那样的情境；他的大脑没有足够的时间去理解正在发生的事情，然后他就从她身边转开了。

But still, to think that Asuka would strike with that, to initiate something like that. If it had ever happened, Shinji always figured he'd be the one to attempt it at first, but he underestimated how much courage Asuka had.

但即便如此，想到明日香会用那种方式出击，发起那样的行动。如果真有此事，真嗣一直以为自己会是首先尝试的那个人，但他低估了明日香所拥有的勇气。

'Or maybe I'm just too cowardly,' thought Shinji. It was rather obvious now what Asuka was battling with for most of the day, or this very well could have been something that had been happening ever since that Christmas night. Shinji knew only too well how many times he had looked at Asuka and wondered what her lips-

“或许我只是太懦弱了。”真嗣心想。如今，明日香一整天都在与之斗争的事情已相当明显，或者这很可能自那个圣诞夜以来就一直在发生。真嗣深知自己有多少次看着明日香，思索着她的唇——

He was pulled out of his thoughts when something soft was suddenly dumped on his head. Pulling it off his head, he had enough time to glimpse Asuka stepping back into the tent before it zipped closed behind her. She had brought out his sleeping bag for him, but the way she dumped it on him made it seem she didn't want him in the tent tonight. Shinji didn't think he would have braved entering it even to get his sleeping bag, and was therefore thankful that she had brought it out for him. He had already decided to stay outside for the night, but knowing that she didn't want him beside her made it somehow worse.

正当他沉浸在自己的思绪中时，突然有什么柔软的东西被扔到了他的头上。他扯下头上的东西，瞥见明日香正退回帐篷，拉链随即在她身后合上。她为他拿来了睡袋，但她扔给他的方式似乎表明她今晚不想让他进帐篷。真嗣本就不敢冒险进去取睡袋，因此对她把睡袋拿出来的举动心存感激。他已决定在外面过夜，但得知她不想让他陪在身边，这让他感觉更糟。

Dreading the drive into Kyoto tomorrow, Shinji lapsed into a fitful sleep and woke up multiple times wishing he was inside the tent beside Asuka.

对明天前往京都的行程感到畏惧，真嗣陷入了不安的睡眠，多次醒来时都希望自己能在帐篷里陪在明日香身边。

Neither of them seemed to get much sleep last night, as was apparent when they both saw each other the next morning. Though Shinji made breakfast, Asuka gave every impression that she didn't want to speak a word to him, and treated him as though an empty space simply filled the spot where he sat. All of this made breakfast go by painfully slow, until it was time to pack up and leave.

昨晚两人似乎都没怎么睡好，这一点在次日早晨他们相见时便显而易见。尽管真嗣做了早餐，但明日香表现得完全不想和他说话，对待他就像他坐的地方本就是一片空无。这一切使得早餐过程异常缓慢，直到收拾行李准备离开的时刻。

If Shinji thought breakfast was bad however, the drive was by far worse. The air was stifled, and a brick wall seemed to have been imposed between them that Asuka was determined to keep up for as long as possible. Even if Shinji glanced over at her, she didn't acknowledge his existence at all, but just kept driving. Eventually, Shinji gave up, and focused his eyes outside the car instead. He wondered how much longer this would persist, but if they reached Kyoto sometime today as was the plan, he couldn't see how this silence could continue.

如果说早餐已经够糟糕了，那么开车这一段路程更是糟糕透顶。空气仿佛凝固，一道无形的砖墙横亘在他们之间，而明日香似乎铁了心要将这堵墙维持得越久越好。即便真嗣偶尔瞥向她，她也完全无视他的存在，只是继续驾驶。最终，真嗣放弃了，转而将目光投向车窗外。他不知道这种沉默还要持续多久，但如果按照计划今天能抵达京都，他实在想象不出这种寂静如何能继续下去。

Meanwhile, Asuka was torn between two different emotions as she drove, one of embarrassment, and the other anger. The embarrassment was rather self explanatory, as even she was unsure what she had been thinking at that time, but she felt more angry than anything. Yes it had been rather sudden, and she probably shouldn't have even tried to do that in the first place, but Shinji's reaction was far to unexpected. Asuka had expected him to splutter uncontrollably, and then eventually relent. But to turn away from her in rejection? She had not expected that, which is why it had come as such a shock.

与此同时，明日香在驾驶时被两种截然不同的情绪撕扯着，一种是尴尬，另一种则是愤怒。尴尬之情不言而喻，连她自己也不确定当时在想些什么，但她感到更多的是愤怒。是的，这一切来得相当突然，她或许根本就不该尝试那样做，但真嗣的反应却出乎意料地令人意外。明日香本以为他会语无伦次，最终屈服。但被他拒绝并转身离开？她从未预料到这一点，因此这突如其来的打击让她措手不及。

Asuka thought that Shinji liked her, that it went even farther than that, but now she was starting to second guess herself. Maybe he was still unconsciously holding back because of who he was, the realization about his AT-field and what not, but should that really stop him if he liked her? Shinji seemed to have gotten over all that back in December, but Asuka wasn't sure how deep his fear went over harming her accidentally.

明日香曾以为真嗣喜欢她，甚至可能不止于此，但现在她开始怀疑自己了。也许他仍无意识地因为自己的身份——关于他的 AT 力场等等——而有所保留，但如果他真的喜欢她，这些真的应该成为阻碍吗？真嗣似乎在去年十二月就已经克服了这一切，但明日香不确定他对无意中伤害她的恐惧有多深。

As she continued driving though, she had to refocus her attention on other things though. As they began getting closer to Kyoto, the traffic started to worsen again. The Sea of Japan disappeared on there right side as the drove further inland, following the highway. After another hour of driving, and weaving around cars, they finally turned off the highway and onto one of the main expressways, leading them into Kyoto. It wasn't long after, that they were forced to stop in the middle of the road, as the car blockage had gotten out of control again.

然而，随着她继续驾驶，她不得不重新将注意力转移到其他事情上。当他们开始接近京都时，交通状况再次恶化。随着他们向内陆深入，沿着高速公路行驶，日本海在他们右侧消失了。又过了一个小时的驾驶，穿梭于车流之间，他们终于驶离高速公路，转上通往京都的主干道。不久之后，他们被迫在路中间停下，因为车辆堵塞再次失控。

Asuka didn't say anything to Shinji, as he wordlessly got out, but she was feeling apprehensive about this, considering what had happened two days ago. Just as they had done before, Shinji walked in front of their car, using his AT-field to push the other cars off to the side so that Asuka could drive down the middle without difficulty. He seemed far more careful as he did this, and time dragged by incredibly slow. Asuka was beginning to wonder if they would ever finish in all honesty.

明日香没有对真嗣说什么，他默默地下车，但她对此感到忧虑，考虑到两天前发生的事情。正如他们之前所做的那样，真嗣走到他们的车前，利用他的 AT 力场将其他车辆推到一边，以便明日香能够毫无困难地沿着中间行驶。他这样做时似乎更加小心，时间拖得异常缓慢。明日香开始怀疑他们是否真的能完成这一切。

After a while, they reached a small break in the pile of cars, and were able to drive freely for several miles where they passed a sign that indicated they were thirty miles outside of Kyoto. Predictably though, more traffic jams followed this, and it was late in the afternoon when they finally crossed over the city bounds.

过了一会儿，他们穿过一堆汽车中的一个小空隙，得以自由行驶了好几英里，途中经过一个指示牌，显示他们距离京都市区还有三十英里。不出所料，随后又遭遇了更多的交通堵塞，直到傍晚时分，他们才终于跨越了城市边界。

As a city, Kyoto was still largely intact, and seemed largely unaffected by the events of Third Impact. Still, as they drove further into the metropolitan area, some buildings had clearly been laid to waste, and only the empty shells of some structure or another remained.

作为一座城市，京都大体上依然完好无损，似乎并未受到第三次冲击事件的影响。然而，随着他们深入都会区，一些建筑显然已被摧毁，只剩下某些结构的空壳。

Before Second Impact, Osaka and Kyoto had been considered part of one giant metropolitan complex, but because of Second Impact, the Osaka bay waters rose, and much of Osaka had been submerged as a result. From the skyline of Kyoto, you could now see the Osaka bay and the ruined city, a reminder of Second Impact.

在第二次冲击之前，大阪和京都被视为一个巨大的都会复合体的一部分，但由于第二次冲击，大阪湾的水位上升，导致大阪大部分地区被淹没。从京都的天际线望去，如今可以看到大阪湾和那座废墟城市，这是第二次冲击的提醒。

Since Kyoto had once been the imperial capital of Japan, its tourist attractions, namely the many different shrines, were popular for many different nationalities to come and see. Because of this, tourist shops could be found on most street corners, and in a rare communication between them, Shinji suggested they stop at one so he could grab a map. Though Asuka didn't reply, or give any sign that she had heard him, she still stopped at the next one they spotted, and Shinji jumped out to get one.

由于京都曾一度是日本的皇城，其旅游景点，即众多各异的寺庙，吸引了来自不同国家的游客前来参观。因此，大多数街角都能找到旅游商店，在一次难得的交流中，真嗣提议他们在一家店里停留，以便他能拿张地图。尽管明日香没有回应，也没有表现出她听到了他的话，但她还是在看到下一家店时停了下来，真嗣便跳下车去拿了一张。

The shop was a typical tourist trap of sorts, with many high priced items that would normally be half as expensive at a normal Japanese shop, but the maps always went for free. Course, this didn't really matter much to Shinji, since there wasn't anybody besides him in the store in the first place. Grabbing all the maps that they offered, including one with the many shrines, and another which showed the entire downtown city proper, Shinji returned to the car. As he unfolded it though, he saw that nearly everything was in English.

这家店可谓是典型的旅游陷阱，许多商品价格高昂，通常在日本普通商店里只需一半的价钱，但地图总是免费提供。当然，这对真嗣来说并不重要，因为店里本来就只有他一个人。他抓起所有提供的地图，包括一张标注众多神社的和另一张展示整个市中心的地图，然后回到了车上。然而，当他展开地图时，发现几乎所有内容都是英文的。

Even though he knew that speaking terms between himself and Asuka were strained right now, he still had to point this out to her.

尽管他知道目前自己和明日香的关系紧张，但他还是不得不向她指出这一点。

"Asuka, I can't read a word of these maps. Its all in English."

“明日香，这些地图我一个字都看不懂。全是英文。”

Without returning an answer, Asuka wordlessly snatched the maps out of his hand, and studied them for several minutes before putting the car in gear, and driving off. Shinji didn't bother questioning her decision to drive while looking at the map in her lap, as he knew he'd just be greeted with silence. Either way, it worried him slightly.

没有回答，明日香默默地从他手中夺过地图，仔细研究了几分钟，然后将车挂上挡，驶离了原地。真嗣没有费心去质疑她边看地图边开车的决定，因为他知道只会得到沉默的回应。无论如何，这让他略感担忧。

Though their goal was to find a home to eventually settle in, with the few remaining hours of sunlight they had remaining to them, this was hardly possible. Instead, Asuka's driving seemed to take them on a tour of the different shrines within the city. The majority of them were still intact, even with the destruction of Third Impact, but a few they passed had collapsed. After seeing all this heritage from his people, Shinji nearly wished that he had come here before now, if only to learn more about the city.

尽管他们的目标是找到一个最终定居的家，但在剩余的几个小时阳光下，这几乎是不可能的。相反，明日香的驾驶似乎带着他们在城市中游览了不同的神社。大多数神社依然完好无损，即便是在第三次冲击的破坏之后，但他们经过的一些已经倒塌。看到这些来自他民族的遗产，真嗣几乎希望自己能早点来这里，哪怕只是为了更多地了解这座城市。

Asuka never stopped as she drove, but slowed down significantly as they drove by any particular shrine. The traffic on the road wasn't bad, so Shinji didn't have to get out to make room with his AT-field. Whether Asuka was actually as interested as Shinji was with the different shrines, he didn't know, but she did glance at them as she drove past them at least.

明日香驾车时从未停下，但每当经过某个神社时，她会明显减速。道路上的交通并不拥堵，因此真嗣无需使用 AT 力场来腾出空间。尽管真嗣不清楚明日香是否真的像他一样对不同的神社感兴趣，但她至少在驾车经过时会瞥上一眼。

As night began to set however, and Asuka turned the headlights on of their station wagon, Shinji was wondering where they were gonna stop in this once bustling city when they passed a large shrine on their right. Even Shinji could recognize this structure as it was one of the more instantly recognizable shrines in Kyoto, even if he couldn't think of the name off the top of his head. The main building within the grounds, was a five story pagoda that was once a buddhist shrine, and was the tallest, and oldest wooden structure in Japan. Several other buildings dotted the grounds, presumably other temples of worship, as well as gardens which surrounded the landscape. Shinji was remarkably surprised that this structure had remained intact, especially considering how old it was, and all the other destruction that Third Impact had created.

然而，随着夜幕降临，明日香打开了他们旅行车的前灯，真嗣开始思索在这座曾经繁华的城市中他们将在何处歇脚。当他们经过右侧一座宏伟的神社时，即便是真嗣也能一眼认出这座建筑，它是京都最为人熟知的神社之一，尽管他一时想不起它的名字。神社内的主建筑是一座五层宝塔，曾是佛教神社，也是日本最高、最古老的木结构建筑。园内散布着其他几座建筑，大概是供奉其他神明的寺庙，周围还有环绕的花园。真嗣对这座建筑能完好无损地保存下来感到非常惊讶，尤其是考虑到它的古老，以及第三次冲击带来的其他破坏。

As the wooden structure started to pass him, and Shinji was nearly looking over his shoulder to keep his eyes on it, Asuka hit the brakes, sending Shinji flying forward, and it was only the seatbelt that prevented him from smashing into the dashboard. At first he thought it was out of spite that she did it, but then she suddenly got out. Feeling puzzled, Shinji did so as well and then heard the first words out of Asuka's mouth that entire day.

当那木制结构开始从他身边经过时，真嗣几乎要扭头才能继续盯着它，这时明日香突然踩下刹车，真嗣猛地向前飞去，幸亏有安全带才没让他撞上仪表盘。起初他以为她是出于恶意才这么做，但随后她突然下了车。感到困惑的真嗣也跟着下了车，然后听到了明日香那天说的第一句话。

"We're stopping here." “我们就在这儿停下。”

Asuka didn't say anything else after that, and Shinji was left to do all the unpacking by himself, while she wandered off somewhere. Shinji of course had to make the decision of whether to unpack the tent or not, and after doing a quick tour of the grounds, that quickly became unnecessary. Though the main temple was sealed shut, and though Shinji could have very easily broken into it with his AT-field, something about defiling his own heritage somehow felt wrong to him, even considering the ridiculous of the situation. Had it been Asuka here with him, and had they been on speaking terms, she probably would have tried kicking the door down by herself.

明日香之后没再说什么，真嗣只好独自一人收拾行李，而她则不知去了哪里。真嗣当然得决定是否要搭帐篷，但在快速巡视了一圈后，这很快变得没有必要了。虽然主庙被封死了，尽管真嗣可以轻易用他的 AT 力场闯进去，但亵渎自己的文化遗产不知为何让他觉得不对劲，即便考虑到情况的荒谬。如果换成是明日香和他在一起，而且他们还能正常交流的话，她大概会自己尝试把门踢开吧。

Instead he settled on one of the smaller temples. The interior was modestly spaced, with only a large buddha statue at the far end of the wall. Shinji brought both their backpacks and sleeping bags into the temple, and then found a spot a short distance away from the temple to cook dinner. Night was already well underway at this point, and as much as he dreaded it, he decided that he should best find Asuka.

相反，他选择了一座较小的寺庙安顿下来。内部空间朴素，仅在远端墙壁处立有一尊大佛像。真嗣将两人的背包和睡袋带进寺庙，随后在离寺庙不远处找了个地方准备晚餐。此时夜色已深，尽管他对此颇为抗拒，但还是决定最好去找明日香。

After walking one length of the gardens, he eventually found her sitting on a bench beside the pool with brightly colored roses around her and the five story pagoda in the background. She didn't react when she saw him, or more than likely, she had blotted out his existence the entire day.

在花园里漫步了一程后，他终于发现她坐在池塘边的一条长椅上，四周环绕着色彩鲜艳的玫瑰，背景是那座五层高的宝塔。她看到他时没有任何反应，更有可能的是，她一整天都将他视若无物。

"I found a place for us to stay the night, and was gonna start preparing dinner."

我找到了一个地方让我们过夜，正准备开始做晚饭。

Again she didn't react or reply to him, but Shinji was beginning to get fed up over this silence. They couldn't continue like this indefinitely either way he looked at it, so best get it out of the way now.

她再次没有回应他，但真嗣开始对这种沉默感到厌烦。无论如何看，他们都不能这样无限期地继续下去，所以最好现在就把事情解决。

Sitting down next to her suddenly, he had hoped that this would spark some sort of reaction, even if it was to just shy away from him a bit; that had been wishful thinking. She was still refusing to look at him, or even acknowledge his existence.

他突然坐到她旁边，希望这能引起某种反应，哪怕只是稍微避开他一点；那只是他的奢望。她仍然拒绝看他，甚至不承认他的存在。

"Asuka-" Shinji began, and though he finally got a reaction, it wasn't what he wanted. She stood up, and started marching away from, determined not to look at him. But Shinji wasn't just going to accept this, and reached and grabbed her hand.

“明日香——”真嗣开口道，尽管他终于得到了反应，但这并不是他想要的。她站起身，开始坚决地走开，决心不回头看他。但真嗣不会就这样接受，他伸手抓住了她的手。

"Asuka listen to me!" he nearly shouted.

“Asuka，听我说！”他几乎喊了出来。

"What!?" she finally said.

“什么！？”她终于开口了。

Though Shinji told her to listen to him, he honestly wasn't sure what he could possibly say about the previous night. That he didn't accept her, that he rejected what she had done? None of that was true of course, but neither did he think he could make it up to her by trying the same thing that she had attempted.

尽管 Shinji 让她听他说，但他真的不确定自己能对昨晚的事说些什么。说他没有接受她，说他拒绝了她的所作所为？当然这些都不是真的，但他也不认为通过尝试她曾试图做的事就能弥补什么。

"If you aren't going to say anything Shinji, then I'm leaving."

"如果你不打算说什么的话，真嗣，那我就走了。"

"I'm sorry!" "对不起！"

Shinji's words caught her in mid-step as she was about to walk away, but even then, she started moving forward again.

真嗣的话让她在即将离开的瞬间停住了脚步，但即便如此，她还是再次迈开了步伐。

'He's sorry?' she thought 'As if those words could could fix the emptiness in my heart now.'

'他道歉了？' 她心想，'仿佛那些话能填补我此刻心中的空虚似的。'

As she made to keep walking though, he caught her again. Feeling fed up herself, Asuka was about to spin around and slap him, when he solved half the problem himself. Spinning Asuka around, he placed both hands on her shoulder, and for one wild moment, Asuka thought that he was going to succeed in where she failed last night, and was half willing to accept that. Instead he brought her into a strong, comforting hug. Anything that Asuka might have expected was instantly shot down and she was tempted to break free of his embrace when he started talking.

然而，正当她准备继续前行时，他又抓住了她。自己也已经受够了，明日香正要转身给他一巴掌，他却自己解决了一半问题。他转过明日香，双手搭在她的肩上，有那么一瞬间，明日香以为他会在她昨晚失败的地方取得成功，甚至半心半意地接受了这一点。然而，他只是给了她一个坚定而安慰的拥抱。明日香可能预料到的任何事情瞬间都被否定了，当他说话时，她甚至想挣脱他的怀抱。

"Asuka...I really don't know what to say in regards to...well, last night I suppose. I appreciate it, I do, but it happened so suddenly that I wasn't sure how to react."

"明日香...关于...呃，昨晚的事，我真不知道该说什么好。我很感激，真的，但这一切发生得太突然，我都不确定该如何反应。"

Asuka let Shinji's words wash over herself, hardly hearing them.

明日香任由真嗣的话语冲刷着自己，几乎没听进去。

'He appreciates it, but doesn't accept it in other words,' thought Asuka, thinking that those words was what Shinji was leaning towards. Unwillingly, she could feel something breaking within her that she hardly knew had existed until recently, and felt something welling up from within her that was unmistakably sadness.

'他感激，但并不接受，换句话说，'明日香心想，认为这就是真嗣所倾向的。不情愿地，她能感觉到内心有什么东西正在破碎，那是她最近才意识到其存在的，同时一种难以言喻的悲伤从心底涌出。

"Asuka...there's a lot ahead of us, but I-"

“明日香……我们前方还有很多，但，我——”

'Just say it God damn it and get it over with. Anymore of this and I...'

'快说吧，该死的，赶紧结束这一切。再这样下去，我……'

"Asuka, you mean a lot to me, and I can only assume that I mean a lot to you as well. I know I have trouble expressing myself at times, and at other times...I'm not sure whether I deserve to be happy like this. Something in the back of mind says that its a bad idea to...to get involved like this. No matter what, my AT-field is a curse that I have to live with, and while I can control it currently, there may be some point where I lose control.

"“明日香，你对我意义重大，我也只能假设你对我同样重要。我知道我有时难以表达自己，而其他时候……我不确定我是否配得上这样的幸福。脑海深处有个声音告诉我，这样投入是个坏主意。无论如何，我的 AT 力场是个我必须与之共存的诅咒，虽然目前我能控制它，但总有一天我可能会失控。”

'I've heard all of this already. Just say it and be done with it!' she nearly shouted at him.

“这些我早就听过了。快说重点，说完就完事了！”她几乎对他吼道。

"But...at the same time, I feel like sometimes I can't control myself when I'm around you. When we stopped at that creek, and you looked...well, beautiful, and I wasn't sure whether everything you did there was on purpose, or just coincidence, but I had difficulty controlling...certain feelings at the time."

但...同时，我觉得有时候在你身边我无法控制自己。当我们停在那个小溪边，你看起来...嗯，很美，我不确定你那时的所作所为是有意为之，还是纯属巧合，但我当时很难控制...某些情感。

At his mention of the word beautiful, Asuka's attention snapped back to his words, and she was now fully attentive. What he was saying about the incident at the creek, Asuka wasn't sure whether that had just been an atypical male reaction or not. Either way, she was now listening to his every word.

当他提到“美丽”这个词时，明日香立刻将注意力转回到他的话上，现在她全神贯注地听着。关于他在小溪边的那番话，明日香不确定那是否只是一种非典型的男性反应。无论如何，她现在正仔细聆听他的每一句话。

"I'm still not sure what I want, or what either of us want for that matter. We're still young, and we don't know what the future might hold. Every human being could return tomorrow and things would go back to how they were before. You'd be back at Nerv, and I'd be just some person you knew for a short time that happened to have an AT-field. Granted, I'd probably be dragged to Nerv as well just judging by what a human with an AT-field means, but I think that would be the end of things. I'd be considered a danger, and quarantined for what I possess, and what I could do. But...even if that did all happen tomorrow, I think I would regret never responding to you properly. If I was you in that situation, I couldn't have committed to that."

“我仍不确定自己想要什么，或者说我们俩各自想要什么。我们还年轻，未来会怎样谁也说不准。也许明天所有人类都能回来，一切恢复原样。你会回到 NERV，而我只是你短暂相识的一个拥有 AT 力场的人。当然，考虑到拥有 AT 力场的人意味着什么，我大概也会被卷入 NERV，但我想那将是事情的终结。我会被视为危险分子，因我所拥有的能力而被隔离。但...即便这一切明天就发生，我想我会后悔从未好好回应过你。如果我是你，处在那种情况下，我无法做出那样的决定。”

As he took a breath, Asuka herself felt like she was suffering from oxygen depravation. She felt like she was standing on the edge of a cliff and Shinji's words would determine whether she fell or not.

当他深吸一口气时，明日香自己也感觉像是遭受了缺氧的折磨。她觉得自己正站在悬崖边上，而真嗣的话语将决定她是坠落还是站立。

"So, Asuka I-" “那么，明日香，我——”

"Okay, okay. Enough's enough Shin-"

“好了，好了。够了，真嗣——”

Asuka's sentence was cut short however, as she felt something slightly moist pressed against her neck. Asuka's brain completely shut off in recognition to what this was, but it was over in a matter of seconds. Shinji stepped back from her, his expression embarrassed, but still with a small smile on his face. Slowly, Asuka brought her hand up and placed it gently over the spot where Shinji's lips had touched her skin. It had happened in a matter of seconds, and the whole thing was over so quickly that Asuka hardly had time to realize what was happening...and no less on the neck either. Asuka felt her face heating up like a teakettle coming to a boil. But still, what Shinji had done, if he didn't feel that way about her...

然而，明日香的话还没说完，就感觉到有什么湿润的东西轻轻压在了她的脖子上。明日香的大脑瞬间停止了思考，意识到这是什么，但这一切只持续了几秒钟。真嗣从她身边退开，表情尴尬，但脸上仍带着一丝微笑。慢慢地，明日香抬起手，轻轻地放在真嗣嘴唇触碰过的地方。这一切发生得太快，整个过程结束得如此迅速，以至于明日香几乎来不及意识到发生了什么...更别提是在脖子上。明日香感到自己的脸像烧开的茶壶一样热了起来。但即便如此，如果真嗣对她没有那种感觉...

"Sh-Shinji...you...," said Asuka her ability to speak temporarily broken.

“真-真嗣...你...”明日香说话的能力暂时中断了。

"Its embarrassing for me too you know," mumbled Shinji.

“你知道，这对我来说也很尴尬，”真嗣咕哝道。

"But still...you just kissed me...and on the neck," said Asuka her words getting quieter as she spoke.

“但即便如此……你刚刚吻了我……还在脖子上，”明日香说着，声音越来越小。

"What does the neck have to do with anything?" asked Shinji, completely puzzled. "It was the best I could do while hugging you."

“脖子有什么关系吗？”真嗣完全摸不着头脑。“在拥抱你的时候，这是我能做到的最好的了。”

"Do you not know anything you idiot!?" Asuka shouted at him, her face turning even redder.

"你难道什么都不懂吗，白痴！？" 明日香对他大喊，脸变得更红了。

"Why? What does that-" "为什么？那是什么意思-"

"Forget it!" shouted Asuka again, turning away from him, her long hair spilling across her shoulders and back.

“算了！”明日香再次喊道，转身背对他，长发如瀑般披散在肩头与背上。

'Doesn't even know what a kiss to the neck means, idiot.'

'连亲吻脖子意味着什么都不知道，傻瓜。'

Well, at least she didn't feel any hesitation anymore.

好吧，至少她不再感到任何犹豫了。

"You said earlier that you'd already found a place for the night."

“你之前说已经找到过夜的地方了。”

"I wasn't sure if you were listening to that," said Shinji, still seeming to be puzzling over what a kiss to the neck meant.

"我不确定你是否在听那个，" 真嗣说道，似乎仍在琢磨亲吻脖子的含义。

"Not like I could block out what you were saying by just ignoring you."

"不像我能通过无视你就屏蔽掉你说的那些话。"

"I suppose so," said Shinji.

"我想也是，" 真嗣说。

"So where is this place?"

"那这个地方在哪儿呢？"

"Not far I guess, though we aren't staying in the main building."

"应该不远，不过我们不住在主楼里。"

"Thats fine, though this area is beautiful. I almost wish there was a home close by so we could just relax here every day."

"那挺好的，这里景色真美。我几乎希望附近有栋房子，这样我们就能每天来这儿放松了。"

"We could search for one, but I'm fairly certain there isn't. Besides, isn't this a bit close to the city."

"我们可以去找一个，但我相当确定这里没有。而且，这不离城市太近了吗？"

"I suppose you are right about that."

"我想你说的没错。"

While talking about the temples, gardens and what they'd like to find in a house, they arrived at the small buddhist temple that Shinji had already settled in. Sliding the shoji door open, they stepped inside. Asuka didn't have much to comment on other than the bronze buddhist statue and the wooden floor, but she felt pleased enough with the place.

在谈论寺庙、花园以及他们理想中的房子时，他们到达了已经安顿好的小佛教寺庙。拉开障子门，他们走了进去。除了青铜佛像和木地板，明日香并没有太多可评论的，但她对这个地方感到相当满意。

Starting a campfire outside with the remaining wood from their old house in Tokyo-2, Shinji prepared breakfast. He supposed that if he really wanted he could cut some of the trees down in the surrounding area with his AT-field, but he still didn't feel like defiling this place if he could help it. In all likelihood, they'd find a place by tomorrow anyway, at least he hoped.

在东京-2 旧居剩下的木柴旁生起篝火，真嗣开始准备早餐。他想，如果真有必要，他可以用 AT 力场砍倒周围的一些树木，但他仍不愿玷污这个地方，如果可以避免的话。无论如何，他们很可能明天就能找到新住处，至少他是这么希望的。

After finishing and eating breakfast, Shinji and Asuka returned inside to the temple. Since it was so old, and certainly not fit to actually live in, with wooden paneling surrounding the outside, there was a distinct draft that seeped into the building and even with being tucked under their sleeping bags, Shinji and Asuka still felt the cold. Before long, Shinji heard the shifting of a sleeping bag coming from where Asuka was, and then moments later, she plopped down on the ground beside him.

吃完早餐后，真嗣和明日香回到了寺庙内。由于这座寺庙年代久远，显然不适合居住，四周都是木板墙，一股明显的穿堂风渗入建筑，即便裹在睡袋里，真嗣和明日香依然感到寒冷。不久，真嗣听到明日香那边传来睡袋的窸窣声，片刻后，她便扑通一声躺在了他旁边的地上。

"Its cold," was all she needed to say. Shinji more than understood her meaning, and ended up unzipping both his and Asuka's sleeping bags, so they could sleep under both of them as two large sheets. Shinji wasn't sure if he should be closer to Asuka, since he had just kissed her, but she didn't seem off put by the small gap between them.

“好冷，”她只需这么说。真嗣完全明白她的意思，于是解开了他和明日香的睡袋拉链，让他们可以一起睡在两个大睡袋下，像两张大被子一样。真嗣不确定自己是否应该更靠近明日香，毕竟他刚刚吻了她，但她似乎并不介意两人之间的小空隙。

"Hey Asuka?" asked Shinji as sleepiness began to engulf them.

“嘿，明日香？”真嗣问道，困意开始笼罩他们。

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Um, though I can understand if you don't want to answer this, since it is embarrassing: what was going through your mind yesterday when you tried to-"

“嗯，虽然我能理解如果你不想回答，因为这很尴尬：昨天你试图……的时候，心里在想什么？”

"You're right, that is too embarrassing," Asuka said quickly, cutting Shinji off. She still wasn't sure what state of mind she had been in when she had tried to kiss Shinji, but it had worked out in the end either way. She could very well have asked that same question back to him, but she instead scooted closer to Shinji so she was directly parallel with his body, her back pressed up against his chest.

“你说得对，那确实太尴尬了。”明日香迅速打断真嗣的话。她仍不确定自己当时是怎样的心态才会试图亲吻真嗣，但无论如何，最终结果还算不错。她本可以反问他同样的问题，但她没有，而是挪近了真嗣，与他身体平行，背部紧贴着他的胸膛。

"...Um, Asuka?" "...呃，明日香？"

"What? And don't tell me this is embarrassing considering what you pulled earlier."

"干嘛？别告诉我这会让你觉得尴尬，考虑到你之前干的事。"

Shinji didn't reply to this, but Asuka didn't even think she would have minded if he had wrapped his arms around her chest at the moment. Needless to say, Shinji still didn't have that sort of courage.

真嗣没有回应，但明日香甚至觉得，那一刻他若能环抱住她的胸膛，她也不会介意。不用说，真嗣依旧缺乏那样的勇气。

While trying to decide where he should place his hands, one of Shinji's feet brushed against Asuka, and he felt her shiver briefly. Whether she was still cold or not, or if it was just the shock from the skin to skin contact, she briefly hesitate, before entwining her feet with his. Shinji was starting to feel light headed at this point, and mumbled something which Asuka only chuckled at. Well, there was still plenty of time to become more familiar with each other, but tonight wasn't that night.

在试图决定双手该放在何处时，真嗣的一只脚无意间碰到了明日香，他感觉到她微微颤抖了一下。不知是因为她还冷，还是仅仅因为肌肤相触的惊吓，她稍作迟疑，随即将脚缠绕在他的脚上。此时，真嗣开始感到有些头晕目眩，喃喃自语了些什么，明日香只是轻声笑了笑。嗯，还有很多时间可以彼此熟悉，但今晚并非那个时刻。

As she felt sleep beginning to sink in, she turned around briefly so that she was facing Shinji and simply said, "Night Shinji," before turning around, snuggling up to him, and slowly drifting off to sleep.

当睡意开始袭来时，她转过身来面对着真嗣，简单地说了一句：“晚安，真嗣。”然后转回去，依偎在他身边，渐渐沉入梦乡。

Shinji found it harder to fall asleep, and was overtly conscious about the nape of Asuka's neck that almost seemed to be presenting itself to him, and the curves of her back and butt which he could feel with his own body. He was starting to feel certain urges again, but forced himself to think about other things that would hopefully calm the problem down.

真嗣发现自己更难入睡，明日香后颈的线条几乎像是在向他展示，而她背部和臀部的曲线也能通过他的身体感受到。他再次感到某些冲动，但强迫自己想些其他事情，希望能平息这种困扰。

It had been a strange set of days Shinji reflected, culminating in something that was both shocking, and wonderful at the same time. Hopefully tomorrow they would find a house, but sleeping like this wasn't bad either, though the feel of a mattress underneath him, and Asuka lying beside him like this...that wasn't so bad either.

这些天真是奇妙，真嗣思忖着，最终发生了既令人震惊又美妙的事情。希望明天他们能找到房子，但像这样睡觉也不坏，尽管身下有床垫的感觉，还有像这样躺在身边的明日香...那也不坏。

With thoughts which slowly dissolved into dreams, Shinji pictured the house that they were searching for, and eventually settled down in, spending every night together for all the nights remaining to them.

随着思绪慢慢融入梦境，真嗣想象着他们正在寻找并最终安顿下来的房子，每晚都一起度过余生的每一个夜晚。

So things are starting to progress more and more with Shinji and Asuka. I tried aiming for the same time frame in chapters between Spawn of Adam and Two of Us for when they first kissed (though I use the term 'first kissed' loosely). The notion of a kiss to the neck has always made me laugh with regards to Shinji and Asuka, and this is also my little nod to EoE. Also, if you don't know what the meaning behind a kiss to the neck is, just look at the title. Puts Shinji's actions in an entirely different perspective, as Asuka certainly thought.

所以，真嗣和明日香的关系正逐渐进展。我尝试在《亚当的子嗣》和《我们俩》中设定他们第一次接吻的时间框架（虽然我用‘第一次接吻’这个词比较宽松）。关于吻在颈部的概念，总是让我对真嗣和明日香的关系感到好笑，这也是我对《EoE》的一点小小致敬。另外，如果你不知道吻在颈部的含义，看看标题就明白了。这让真嗣的行为有了完全不同的视角，正如明日香所想的那样。

As a side note, at the onset of Two of Us, I always had the idea in mind that they would never spend much time in Tokyo-3, and kinda always had Kyoto in the back of my mind as a destination. Out of all the cities in Japan I would like to visit, Kyoto ranks at the top of my list, and I almost wish I could fly there, if nothing more than to just have more insight for writing this.

顺便一提，在《我们俩》开始时，我总是设想他们不会在东京-3 待太久，而京都一直是我心中的目的地。在日本所有城市中，京都位居我想访问的城市之首，我几乎希望能飞过去，哪怕只是为了更深入地了解它，以便写作。

Well lets see how it goes from here I suppose.

好吧，让我们看看接下来会如何发展。

### Chapter 22: Longing

Right, well, not sure if this constitutes a surprise update, but update nonetheless. I'm sure if I thought about things, I could talk more, but its 6:30 in the morning and I've been up all night.

好吧，不确定这是否算得上惊喜更新，但更新还是来了。我确信如果我仔细考虑，还能说更多，但现在才早上 6:30，我整晚没睡。

Though they both awoke at the same time, neither of them seemed to want to escape the warmth shared between them. Just as they had fallen asleep the night before, Asuka was still sleeping beside Shinji, her back pressed firmly against his chest. Memories of the previous night washed over the two of them, and both were somewhat expecting something to happen, even though neither spoke a word to each other. Still, when Asuka suddenly sat up, clad in nothing but a shirt and panties, Shinji's eyes couldn't help but follow her. Turning her eyes towards him, Asuka's eyes locked with Shinji's, and though their was an ample amount of teasing within them, their also seemed to be the question of, 'what do you want to do?' At this point, Shinji had to look away from her, while Asuka couldn't help but smirk at his nervousness. In all honesty though, if he had tried something, Asuka would have kicked him, as she herself wasn't ready for something like that.

尽管两人同时醒来，却似乎都不愿离开彼此间共享的温暖。正如前一晚入睡时那样，明日香依然紧贴着真嗣的胸膛，背对着他熟睡。昨晚的记忆涌上心头，两人都隐约期待着会发生些什么，尽管谁也没有开口。然而，当明日香突然坐起，只穿着衬衫和内裤时，真嗣的目光不由自主地追随她。她转头望向他，两人的视线交汇，尽管眼神中带着几分戏谑，也似乎在问：‘你想做什么？’此时，真嗣不得不移开视线，而明日香则忍不住对他紧张的样子露出微笑。说实话，如果他真的有所行动，明日香肯定会踢他，因为她自己还没准备好面对那种事。

Standing up fully, Asuka let the sleeping bag fall around her and stretched her arms in the air, revealing her stomach and narrow hips unhidden by the shirt. Again, Shinji's eyes rolled over this spectacle, but it was just a fleeting glimpse before Asuka started putting her pants on. It was relatively early, but if they wanted to find a house today, they need to comb as much ground as possible.

站直身子，明日香让睡袋滑落四周，伸了个懒腰，露出了腹部和衬衫遮不住的纤细腰肢。又一次，真嗣的目光掠过这一幕，但只是匆匆一瞥，因为明日香已经开始穿裤子了。时间尚早，但如果他们今天想找到房子，就需要尽可能多地搜寻。

Though they had agreed upon this, they lingered for a while longer within the grounds of the temple. It was truly a beautiful place, and likely something that they wouldn't forget anytime soon. With everything already packed away in the car, they spent an hour more walking around the gardens, before finally sitting on the bench where Shinji had found Asuka the previous night.

尽管他们已经达成共识，但还是在这座寺庙的范围内多逗留了一会儿。这里确实是个美丽的地方，很可能不久后他们都不会忘记。所有东西已经打包好放在车上，他们在花园里多逛了一个小时，最后坐在昨晚真嗣发现明日香的那条长椅上。

"We should probably be leaving soon," said Shinji after a moments silence.

“我们可能该走了。”真嗣在片刻沉默后说道。

"I know," sighed Asuka as she looked upwards to the sky. "Though its hard to believe we're in the middle of Kyoto right now just judging by the scenery. If we could find a place as beautiful as this, I think I could be at ease."

"我知道，" 明日香叹息着抬头望向天空。"虽然很难相信我们现在正身处京都市中心，光看这景色的话。如果真能找到这样一个美丽的地方，我想我会感到安心吧。"

Shinji would have liked to ask her if she was thinking about the events of last night, but thought better of it.

真嗣本想问她是否在想昨晚的事情，但转念一想还是作罢了。

"Well, judging from the map, if we go the furthest north of Kyoto, most of it is forest with sparse towns here and there, so we should be able to find something similar to this I suppose."

"嗯，从地图上看，如果我们往京都最北边走，那里大多是森林，零星散布着一些小镇，我想我们应该能找到类似这样的地方。"

"If you say so," shrugged Asuka, though it seemed she didn't believe so.

"既然你这么说，" 明日香耸了耸肩，尽管她似乎并不相信。

Returning to their car, they started the journey north. Now that it was daytime, they had a much better view of downtown Kyoto as they drove past all sorts of temples and shrines. Several times Shinji was almost tempted to ask Asuka to stop so they could get out and just walk around a few of these places, but he knew that time would be precious to them today. As such, driving through downtown took longer than it should have, but as they started getting closer to the countryside, they predictably ran into the inevitable traffic jam.

回到车上，他们开始了北上的旅程。现在已是白天，他们开车经过京都市中心时，能更好地欣赏到各种寺庙和神社。有好几次，真嗣几乎忍不住想让明日香停车，这样他们就可以下车在这些地方走走，但他知道今天时间对他们来说非常宝贵。因此，穿过市中心的时间比应该的要长，但当他们开始接近乡村时，不出所料地遇到了不可避免的交通堵塞。

At this point though, they had to decide where to begin searching. Several large towns lay north of Kyoto, though unfortunately, since the maps they had were largely for tourists, they didn't give much indication about the different neighborhoods. Without many options, they just decided to remain on the highway until they saw a likely place to go.

然而到了这一步，他们必须决定从哪里开始搜索。京都北部有几个较大的城镇，但遗憾的是，他们手头的地图大多是针对游客的，并没有太多关于不同街区的信息。由于选择不多，他们决定先沿着高速公路行驶，直到看到一个合适的地方再作打算。

Though the splendor of Kyoto had subsided since the events of Second Impact, it was still a place of beauty and the largest inland city on the island of Japan. The botanical gardens were a sight to behold, and the many parks that dotted the landscape were unrecognizable in the western world. Most of these, along with the shrines, were pointed out in the tourist maps they had, and they took one of the exits that was very descriptive about one of those parks.

尽管自第二次冲击事件以来，京都的辉煌已有所减退，但它依然是日本岛上最大的内陆城市，充满美丽景致。植物园的景色令人叹为观止，遍布各地的众多公园在西方世界中几乎无法辨认。这些公园以及神社大多在他们的旅游地图上有所标注，他们选择了一个对其中一个公园描述非常详细的出口。

Immediately upon exiting, they were greeted by several small communities. Most of these were compact, two story western houses, but here and there was also the traditional Japanese house. Cars were parked in front of the houses where most lacked a garage, and many had potted plants or small gardens growing out front. Though being as it had been nearly seven months since anyone had tended them, weeds had sprung up between the flowers and the grass was far to high.

一出门，他们便看到了几个小型社区。这些社区大多是由紧凑的两层西式房屋组成，但也不时能看到传统的日式住宅。许多房屋前都停着车，因为大多数房子没有车库，门前还摆放着盆栽或小花园。尽管距离上次有人打理已经过去了近七个月，野草已经在花丛中蔓延，草坪也长得过高了。

Shinji and Asuka didn't bother getting out as they drove, being able to tell at a glance whether they'd even considering living at any of these houses or not. Though they were only two people, even they felt like the houses here were too small. It was also possible that the houses in this neighborhood were older than the ones built in Tokyo-2, which would made it unlikely that they would find something similar to their old house in Tokyo-2.

真嗣和明日香开车时并没有下车查看，他们一眼就能判断出是否考虑在这些房子里居住。虽然他们只有两个人，但这些房子对他们来说还是显得太小了。此外，这个社区的房子可能比东京-2 新建的房子还要旧，这使得他们很难在这里找到与东京-2 旧居相似的房子。

"This is more difficult than I thought it would be," mumbled Asuka as she stopped the car at a now dysfunctional stoplight.

“这比我想象的要难多了，”明日香在一个已经失效的红绿灯前停下车，喃喃自语道。

"Did you want to move further north then?" asked Shinji.

“你是想再往北边搬吗？” 真嗣问道。

"I don't know, I have a feeling that what we find there, wont be much different than here. Though you have a point, there doesn't seem to be much here for us."

我不知道，我有种感觉，我们在那里找到的东西，和这里不会有多大差别。不过你说的有道理，这里似乎也没什么值得我们留恋的。

Putting the car in gear, Asuka turned around, and returned to the highway.

将车挂入档位，明日香调转车头，返回高速公路。

Snaking there way further north, they passed further into the country side. Soon, the once bustling city lay behind them, and the only thing that surrounded them on either side were rows of trees. They were in a valley of sorts, where the road seemed to have been carved out on either side of the mountain. The maps that they had gathered at this point were all but worthless, as most of them only showed the Kyoto metropolitan area. The only one that gave any useful information, only listed a couple shrines in the area that were a possible spot for tourists. Even the directions were somewhat ambiguous.

他们蜿蜒向北深入，穿过乡村地带。不久，曾经繁华的城市已被抛在身后，四周只剩下成排的树木。他们仿佛置身于某种山谷之中，道路似乎是在山体两侧开凿出来的。此时，他们收集的地图几乎毫无用处，因为大多数只显示了京都市区。唯一提供有用信息的那张地图，也仅列出了该地区几个可能吸引游客的神社。就连指引也有些模糊不清。

After rounding a corner, they came upon a fork in the road, and Asuka slowed the car so they could look at the signs. Both directions had shrines according to the guide, but judging from the area, it was unlikely that they would find any houses suited towards their needs, or any houses to begin with. Though there was a sign that sparked Asuka's interest.

绕过一个弯道后，他们遇到了一个岔路口，明日香放慢车速以便查看路标。根据指南，两个方向都有神社，但从地形判断，找到适合他们需求的房屋，甚至任何房屋，可能性都不大。不过，有一个路标引起了明日香的兴趣。

"Hey Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"If I'm reading this right, their should be a hotel not far from here with a natural hot springs."

"如果我没理解错的话，附近应该有一家酒店，那里有天然温泉。"

"Shouldn't we be looking for a house instead, or have you given up already?"

"我们不应该找房子吗，还是你已经放弃了？"

"Nothing of the sort, but I'm starting to feel that we may have started in the wrong direction. Even so, just the idea of being able to take a proper bath sounds wonderful. Can you honestly say the thought hasn't crossed your mind before?"

“并非如此，但我开始觉得我们可能一开始就走错了方向。即便如此，仅仅是想到能好好洗个澡就感觉很美妙。你真的能说之前从没这么想过吗？”

"I guess," shrugged Shinji. "But we have more important things to deal with right now."

“我想也是，”真嗣耸了耸肩。“但我们现在有更重要的事情要处理。”

"An hour or two wouldn't hurt. It isn't even noon yet."

“一两个小时也无妨。现在还没到中午呢。”

Sighing lightly, Shinji scratched the back of his head before finally resigning to Asuka's wishes.

轻叹一声，真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，最终还是顺从了明日香的意愿。

"Okay, but an hour. Nothing more, and nothing less."

“好吧，就一个小时。不多不少。”

With that settled, they returned to their car, and driving faster than she should have, Asuka hooked a right, and drove towards what was referred to as an onsen in the Japanese language. Shinji was somewhat surprised that Asuka seemed thrilled about this, but she was a girl afterall he supposed. He had rather forgotten about daily necessities humanity had before Third Impact happened, but even he had to admit that taking a hot bath would be nice.

事情就这样定了下来，他们回到车上，明日香比平时开得更快，向右一拐，驶向了日语中被称为“温泉”的地方。真嗣有些惊讶明日香对此如此兴奋，但毕竟她是个女孩子，他想。他几乎忘记了第三次冲击发生前人类日常生活的必需品，但即便如此，他也得承认泡个热水澡会很惬意。

In a much shorter time than they had initially thought, they were driving into the small town. There was only one road through the whole town, and the houses that they saw were far to small to even consider living in. The town didn't even seem to have a grocery store, and Shinji had to wonder why people even bother to come here.

比他们最初预想的要快得多，他们驶入了这座小镇。整个小镇只有一条路贯穿，他们看到的房子都小得根本不值得考虑居住。镇上甚至没有一家杂货店，这让真嗣不禁疑惑人们为何还要来这里。

Just by following the road, they eventually stumbled on the hotel. Several cars were parked in the parking lot, and it seemed a rather popular spot for Japanese people before Third Impact. Getting out of their car, they walked up the front steps, and opened the door. The building was made entirely out of wood, as was customary for many Japanese buildings, but it was surprisingly hot inside. Asuka already felt like she was sweating.

仅仅沿着那条路走，他们最终找到了那家酒店。停车场里停着几辆车，似乎在第三次冲击之前，这里颇受日本人的欢迎。他们下了车，走上前门的台阶，推开了门。整栋建筑完全由木头建成，这是许多日本建筑的传统，但里面却出奇地热。明日香已经觉得自己开始出汗了。

"Have you ever been to a place like this before?" she asked. As Shinji went to reply though, she said, "Never mind, I think I already know the answer."

"你以前来过这样的地方吗？" 她问道。然而，当真嗣正要回答时，她说："算了，我想我已经知道答案了。"

Ignoring the front counter, they stepped to the side and down a long hallway. They passed several flights of stairs that would likely take you up to the bedrooms, but they didn't bother taking these. At the end of the hallway, they found the entrance to the open air bath, that was split between genders. Shinji and Asuka stood outside of the doorways for several seconds before Asuka said, "Well, I guess I'll see you in about an hour or so." Passing through the cloth curtain, she rounded a corner and disappeared from Shinji's sight.

他们没有理会前台，而是走到一旁，沿着一条长长的走廊前进。途中经过了几段楼梯，这些楼梯很可能会带你通向卧室，但他们并没有费心去走这些楼梯。在走廊的尽头，他们找到了露天浴池的入口，这个浴池是按性别分隔的。真嗣和明日香在门口站了几秒钟，然后明日香说："好吧，我想大约一个小时后见。" 她穿过布帘，转过一个弯，从真嗣的视线中消失了。

Entering his own genders room, Shinji wasn't really surprised with this turn of events, but in some small corner of his mind, he wondered what Asuka would have said if he had mentioned joining her. Well, such a thing wouldn't happen.

走进自己的更衣室，真嗣对这一变故并不感到意外，但在内心某个小小的角落，他不禁好奇，如果自己提到要加入明日香的话，她会作何反应。不过，这种事情是不会发生的。

The changing room was modestly spaced, with lockers to store your stuff in, and showers to rinse yourself off afterwards. Neither of these things Shinji had to worry about, so, stripping down until he was stark naked, he grabbed one of the many folded towels inside the basket near the door leading to the bath, wrapped it around his waist, and entered.

更衣室空间适中，设有储物柜存放个人物品，以及淋浴间供事后冲洗。这些对真嗣来说都不必担心，因此他脱得一丝不挂，从门口篮子里拿起一条折叠好的毛巾，围在腰间，便走进了浴室。

A blast of steam assaulted his face, but it wasn't unpleasant, and quite the opposite. Shinji immediately felt himself relax after slipping into the bath, nearly falling asleep instantly. Because of his bodies composition, he didn't tire, never felt overworked, and nor did his muscles ache. But even he felt his entire body relaxing as though all his mental exhaustion was being expunged.

一股蒸汽迎面扑来，但并不令人不适，反而恰恰相反。真嗣一踏入浴池，立刻感到身心放松，几乎瞬间就要睡着。由于身体的特殊构造，他从不感到疲惫，也不会过度劳累，肌肉也从不酸痛。但即便如此，他仍感到全身放松，仿佛所有的精神疲惫都在被驱散。

Leaning against the edge of the bath, he looked up to the clear blue sky. This was a pleasant place, far removed from the overcrowded city and he could imagine himself staying here...if this was an actual house. He wondered how Asuka felt about this place, especially now after sinking into the bath, but he assumed she felt something similar as well. This was a good place to come and relax occasionally, but he wouldn't want to stay here.

倚靠在浴池边缘，他抬头望向清澈的蓝天。这里是个宜人的所在，远离拥挤喧嚣的城市，他几乎能想象自己留在此地的情景……如果这真是一栋房子的话。他好奇明日香对这个地方的感受，尤其是此刻沉浸在浴池中的她，但他猜想她的感受或许也与他相似。偶尔来此放松是个不错的选择，但他并不想久留于此。

"...Shinji?" "...真嗣？"

Though they had been closed moments before, Shinji's eyes opened wide and darted around, thinking that he had heard Asuka nearby. Well, she may be on the other side of the wall, but he didn't hear anything over there so-

尽管刚才还紧闭着，真嗣的眼睛突然睁得大大的，四处张望，心想自己听到了明日香在附近的声音。嗯，她可能在墙的另一边，但他那边什么也没听到——

"Behind you idiot," came a quiet voice.

“在你身后，笨蛋。”一个轻柔的声音传来。

As he turned his neck, he could almost hear the bones creaking as he turned towards the sound of her voice. Asuka was standing there, her face flushed in embarrassment, and her eyes cast downwards towards the ground. Her hair was tied up in a bunch behind her head, so as to avoid getting wet, but Shinji's eyes were almost immediately directed to the thing she had wrapped around her body. For all intents and purposes, Asuka was naked, except for the white towel that she had wrapped around her. From her chest to her thighs, only the fabric of the towel covered the important parts, while the rest was barred to the world. It didn't even seem that she had entered the bath yet, but after undressing, had come over here instead.

当他转过头时，几乎能听到骨头嘎吱作响的声音，他转向她的声音方向。明日香站在那里，脸上因尴尬而泛红，眼睛低垂着看向地面。她的头发在脑后扎成一束，以免弄湿，但真嗣的目光几乎立刻就被她裹在身上的东西吸引住了。从各方面来看，明日香几乎是赤裸的，除了她裹着的白色毛巾。从胸部到大腿，只有毛巾的布料遮盖着重要部位，其余部分则暴露在世人面前。她似乎还没进浴室，而是在脱掉衣服后直接来到了这里。

Being unable to utter a single thing, Shinji gaped open mouthed at her, until she said in a very girlish voice, entirely unlike herself, "If you stare so much, you'll only make this even more embarrassing."

无法吐露一言，真嗣张口结舌地盯着她，直到她用一种完全不像她自己的少女般的声音说道：“你这么盯着看，只会让这更尴尬。”

Still unable to talk, Shinji whipped his head around, and stared across the bath to the other side, trying to focus on anything that his mind could lock onto. Unfortunately, the only thing he was able to focus on, were the soft sounds of Asuka's feet as she stepped across the wet floor. When he heard the shuffling sound of a towel being let go of, and falling to the ground, Shinji felt himself go rigid in more ways than one. He heard the small splash of water as she put one foot in, and then other, as well as the soft sigh that escaped her lips as she submerged herself entirely in the water, a slight distance away from him.

仍然说不出话来，真嗣猛地转过头，盯着浴池的另一边，试图将注意力集中在任何能锁定的事物上。不幸的是，他唯一能集中注意力的，是明日香踩在湿漉漉的地板上发出的轻柔脚步声。当他听到毛巾被松开并落在地上的沙沙声，以及她将一只脚放入水中，然后是另一只脚，以及她完全浸入水中时从唇间逸出的轻叹声，真嗣感到自己以不止一种方式变得僵硬。她与他保持一定距离，完全浸入水中。

Being now fully aware of the situation he was in, Shinji scooted far enough away so that his peripheral vision wouldn't catch anything. However, why was she doing something like this? Didn't she say not that long ago that she'd see him in an hour? Why the sudden change of heart? Was the kiss from yesterday the culprit in all this?

如今完全明白自己所处的情况，真嗣迅速挪开，确保自己的余光不会瞥见任何东西。然而，她为何要这样做？不久前她不是还说一小时后见吗？为何突然改变主意？昨天的吻是这一切的罪魁祸首吗？

"Hey Shinji, how come you're so far away?" came Asuka's quiet voice.

“嘿，真嗣，你怎么离得这么远？”明日香轻声问道。

'As if that needed an explanation,' Shinji nearly yelled at her, but he had to calm himself down. But Asuka's next words pierced his heart in a way that nearly drove all his reasoning away.

“好像这还需要解释似的，”真嗣几乎对她大喊，但他必须让自己冷静下来。然而明日香接下来的话却以一种几乎让他失去理智的方式刺痛了他的心。

"Hey, its alright if you want to look. I won't mind."

“嘿，如果你想看的话，没关系。我不会介意的。”

A battle began playing out in Shinji's head. On the one very obvious hand, he wanted to look. On the more practical hand, this seemed like some sort of trick to Shinji. Surely Asuka was just teasing him. She had gone from appearing embarrassed earlier, to now fully open with him looking. How could he not be suspicious? These two things played out in Shinji's mind for what felt like hours, but was in reality, a matter of seconds. In the end, his own desires won over.

一场内心的斗争在真嗣的脑海中上演。一方面，他确实想看；另一方面，这似乎是某种陷阱。阿斯卡肯定只是在逗他玩。她从之前的害羞，到现在完全不在乎他看。他怎能不怀疑呢？这两种想法在真嗣的脑海中交织，感觉像是过了几个小时，但实际上只是几秒钟。最终，他自己的欲望占了上风。

Turning his head slowly, in preparation for what he may, or may not see, he first noticed the distinct smirk on Asuka's face as though she was enjoying something.

他缓缓转过头，准备迎接可能或不可能出现的景象，首先注意到的是明日香脸上那明显的讥笑，仿佛她在享受着什么。

"Well, its nice to see that you have a backbone of some kind."

"嗯，能看到你有点骨气真是太好了。"

Second, his eyes traveled down Asuka's body that was submerged in the water, and the white bikini that she was wearing. Shinji felt himself deflate suddenly. Meanwhile, Asuka had clearly thrown aside her attempt at a straight face, and was laughing hysterically while clutching her side and kicking her feet in the water.

其次，他的目光顺着在水中半沉的明日香的身体，以及她身上穿着的白色比基尼下滑。真嗣突然感到自己泄了气。与此同时，明日香显然已经放弃了保持严肃的尝试，一边捧腹大笑，一边在水里踢着脚。

"HAHAHAHA, I can't believe you actually fell for that! Are you that much of an idiot!?"

"哈哈哈哈，真不敢相信你居然上当了！你真有那么傻吗！？"

'I certainly feel like one,' thought Shinji as he slowly sunk his head in the water, feeling like disappearing.

'我确实感觉像是一个人，' 真嗣想着，慢慢地将头沉入水中，感觉自己仿佛要消失一般。

"Did you honestly expect me to enter in here with nothing but a towel!?" asked Asuka as she wiped tears away from her eyes.

“你真的以为我会只裹着一条毛巾进来吗？！” 明日香一边问，一边擦去眼角的泪水。

Shinji was silent, trying to ignore Asuka's laughs. He should have seen this coming, and was angry at himself for not expecting this. He also rebuked himself for giving in to his desires.

真嗣沉默不语，试图忽视明日香的笑声。他本该预见到这一幕，对自己没有预料到这一点感到愤怒。他也责备自己屈服于欲望。

Asuka though, seeing that Shinji had clearly just suffered a humiliating defeat, reeled back from the laughter and said, "Sorry, I just couldn't help myself. It seemed like such an opportunity."

然而，明日香看到真嗣显然刚遭受了一次羞辱性的失败，便忍住了笑声，说道：“抱歉，我实在忍不住。这机会太难得了。”

"So if you didn't have that bathing suit, you wouldn't have come in," Shinji said, finally speaking up.

"所以如果你没有那件泳衣，你就不会进来了，" 真嗣终于开口说道。

"Of course not," said Asuka. "That would be pushing the limits far too much."

"当然不会，" 明日香说。"那可就太过分了。"

"So then you being embarrassed with the towel was all part of it as well?"

"那么你用毛巾遮羞也是计划的一部分吗？"

"Uh...well, that was sorta embarrassing. Your expression was..."

"呃...嗯，那有点尴尬。你的表情是..."

Asuka's words petered off, trying to forget how glued Shinji's eyes were to her body when he first saw her. She hadn't counted on that.

明日香的话渐渐弱了下去，试图忘记真嗣第一次见到她时眼睛是如何紧盯着她的身体。她没料到会这样。

"And how much time did you waste coming up with this plan?"

"你花了多少时间来策划这个计划？"

"Come on, it was just a bit of fun. When was the last time we got to laugh like this?"

"来吧，这只是开个玩笑。我们上次这样大笑是什么时候了？"

"You did all the laughing," groaned Shinji.

"笑的全是你，"真嗣呻吟道。"

"Whats the difference," said Asuka, clearly still in a good mood.

"有什么区别，"明日香说，显然心情依然很好。"

"Forget it Asuka," said Shinji, letting himself sink into the water.

“算了吧，明日香。” 真嗣说着，让自己沉入水中。

Asuka watched him for several seconds, with her hand resting against her chin before she asked, "Are you mad at me?"

明日香盯着他看了好几秒，手托着下巴，然后问道：“你在生我的气吗？”

"...I'm mad at myself for thinking...no, forget it."

“……我生自己的气，因为想着……不，算了。”

Silence them engulfed for several seconds, before Asuka said in a very deadpan voice-

沉默笼罩了片刻，随后明日香用一种极其平淡的语气说道——

"So then, do you want to see me naked?"

"那么，你想看我裸体吗？"

The silence that engulfed them this time was much heavier than the first, and Shinji clearly didn't know what to say to this, but it didn't seem like Asuka actually expected an answer from him. Instead, she dove into the next topic, trying to ignore what she had just said.

这一次笼罩他们的沉默比第一次沉重得多，真嗣显然不知道该如何回应，但明香似乎并不真的期待他的回答。相反，她转入了下一个话题，试图忽略她刚刚说的话。

"This place is really nice, and I feel like its been years since I last had a bath. I wouldn't mind staying her for a while. But-"

"这个地方真的很棒，我感觉好像已经好几年没泡过澡了。我不介意在这里多待一会儿。但是——"

"It doesn't feel right either," said Shinji speaking her mind.

"这样也不对劲，" 真嗣坦率地说出了她的想法。

Asuka frowned at him, but nodded all the same.

明日香皱眉看着他，但还是点了点头。

"I don't know if thats the right way to put it, but overall, yeah. This place is beautiful, relaxing, the environment is great, but something is missing. This place obviously isn't a home, but we could probably make it a home. At the same time though, it feels like a vacation spot that is almost too perfect in a sense. I don't know if I could live here."

“我不知道这么说是否恰当，但总的来说，是的。这个地方美丽、宁静，环境极佳，但总觉得少了点什么。这里显然不是家，但我们或许能把它变成家。然而，与此同时，它又像是一个近乎完美的度假胜地。我不知道自己是否能在这里生活。”

"I understand the feeling," said Shinji. "Spending time here occasionally would be nice, but permanent residence is...

“我理解那种感觉，”真嗣说道，“偶尔来这里待上一段时间会很不错，但长期居住就……”

They still weren't sure what they were looking for, but this didn't seem to be it.

他们仍然不确定自己在寻找什么，但这里似乎并非他们要找的地方。

"Well either way, if we do find a place around here, I would like to come here occasionally. I'd forgotten what a proper bath feels like," said Asuka as she threw her arms up in the air and stretched out.

“无论如何，如果我们在这里找到一个地方，我希望能偶尔来这里。我已经忘记了真正的泡澡是什么感觉了。”明日香说着，双臂向上伸展，舒展身体。

"Yeah, it is nice," said Shinji.

“是啊，真不错。” 真嗣说道。

Looking away from the sky, Asuka glanced over at Shinji. Though she had had her bit of fun, Shinji had hardly looked at her since she had entered the bath. It seemed that he was still embarrassed, and while she felt a little embarrassed as well, it wasn't as though this was much different than the time they had swam in that river. Besides, they slept next to each other more often than naught, and it wasn't as though this was much more embarrassing than that, which they had gotten used to. Though as much as Asuka would deny it, deep down, she enjoyed it when Shinji looked at her. To know that she was the only person that he gave attention to brought a certain warmth to her chest.

避开天空的视线，明日香瞥了一眼真嗣。虽然她自得其乐了一番，但自从她进入浴室以来，真嗣几乎没有正眼瞧过她。看来他还在害羞，尽管她自己也感到有些尴尬，但这与他们在那条河里游泳时的情况并无太大差别。何况，他们同床共枕的次数也不少，这并不比那更令人尴尬，他们早已习惯了。尽管明日香嘴上不承认，内心深处，她喜欢真嗣注视她的时刻。知道自己是唯一一个他关注的人，这让她心中涌起一股暖意。

"Shinji?" Asuka said, suddenly quietly.

“真嗣？”明日香突然轻声说道。

"Hmm?" was all he replied, not looking over at her.

“嗯？”他只是这样回应，没有转头看她。

Asuka didn't say anything in reply however, and instead slowly stood up, and walked towards where Shinji was sitting. Though he heard the ripple of the water move, he still didn't look at her, but began tensing up. When she sat down next to him, it was all he could do to not look over at her, as he knew his eyes would immediately be directed towards her chest.

然而，明日香没有回答，而是缓缓站起身，走向真嗣坐着的地方。尽管他听到了水波的荡漾声，却依旧没有看向她，只是开始紧张起来。当她在他身边坐下时，他竭力克制自己不去看她，因为他知道自己的目光会立刻被她的胸部吸引。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"What?" asked Shinji, wishing that his tone wasn't so harsh.

“什么？”真嗣问道，希望自己的语气没有那么生硬。

Apparently annoyed that he was still refusing to look at her, Asuka grabbed his cheeks with one hand, and turned his face so that he was looking directly at her. It was the first time that Shinji had a good look at Asuka since she had first entered, and he had difficulties not wanting to kiss her again. Water was glistening against her cheek in the sunlight, and her hair was slightly damp from the steam emanating off the water. Looking closely, it seemed that she had taken great lengths to tie her hair up, and several locks of the brightly colored red kept on falling into her vision. Her lips were moist, and this was almost certainly from the water, but they had a certain amount of seductiveness to them nonetheless. Above all else though, in Shinji's peripheral, he could see the distinct outline of her cleavage, which made him wonder if the bikini wasn't something she had this entire time, or rather something she had found in the woman's dressing room. If so, there was a strong possibility it didn't fit Asuka's still small frame.

显然对真嗣仍拒绝看她感到恼火，明日香用一只手抓住他的脸颊，将他的脸转向自己，让他直视着她。这是自明日香进入以来，真嗣第一次好好地看她，他几乎难以抑制再次吻她的冲动。阳光下，水珠在她脸颊上闪烁，她的头发因水汽而略显湿润。仔细一看，她似乎费了很大劲才把头发扎起来，几缕鲜艳的红色发丝不断落入视线中。她的嘴唇湿润，这显然是水的缘故，但依然透着几分诱惑。最重要的是，在真嗣的余光中，他能看到她明显的乳沟轮廓，这让他不禁猜想，那件比基尼是她一直就有的，还是她在女更衣室里找到的。如果是后者，那么这件泳衣很可能并不适合明日香依然娇小的身形。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"...What?" he replied, still focused on all these nuances.

“……什么？”他回答道，依旧专注于这些细微之处。

"You're really perverted sometimes you know that."

“你有时候真的很变态，你知道吗。”

It seems that she had caught him looking, but Shinji didn't have any means of retorting. Asuka let go of his cheeks then, but instead of moving away from him, she leaned up against him. At first she just rested her head against his shoulder, but soon, she pressed her body against his, so that skin contacted skin. Shinji felt his body heat jump up several degrees at this and wondered if his entire body was turning red.

看来她已经发现他在偷看，但真嗣没有任何反驳的手段。明日香松开了他的脸颊，却没有离开他，而是靠了上去。起初她只是将头靠在他的肩膀上，但很快，她将身体紧贴着他，肌肤相触。真嗣感到自己的体温骤然升高，心想自己的全身是否都变红了。

"I miss being able to do this," mumbled Asuka quietly beside him.

“我想念能这样做的时光。”明日香在他身旁轻声咕哝道。

"Miss this?" wondered Shinji.

“想念这个？”真嗣疑惑道。

"Back in Tokyo-2, when we used to sit on the couch together. I enjoyed those times."

"回到东京-2 的时候，我们常常一起坐在沙发上。我很怀念那些时光。"

Smiling slightly in spite of the situation, Shinji had to agree with her.

尽管处境艰难，真嗣还是微微一笑，不得不赞同她。

"I did too, though this is also different...almost as though we're bathing together."

我也这么觉得，不过这次感觉又不太一样...简直像是在一起洗澡似的。

Though Shinji spoke his mind, and felt embarrassed because of it, even Asuka felt herself turning red.

尽管真嗣说出了心里话，感到尴尬，但就连明日香也觉得自己脸红了。

"God, you really know when to say the wrong thing," sighed Asuka. Removing her head from his shoulder, her glance instead trailed down Shinji's chest, taking in his own nuances, before looking down towards his waist.

“天啊，你真的很会挑时候说错话。”明日香叹了口气。她从他的肩膀上移开头部，目光转向真嗣的胸膛，细细打量着他身上的细微之处，然后向下看向他的腰部。

"Hey, Shinji? I've been wondering, but how come you brought the towel into the bath with you?"

“嘿，真嗣？我一直在想，你怎么洗澡还带着毛巾？”

At her words, Shinji felt his mind froze. In all honesty, that had been the main reason that he felt so embarrassed, the fact that if that towel was removed, he'd be completely naked.

听到她的话，真嗣感觉自己的思绪瞬间凝固了。说实话，这正是他感到如此尴尬的主要原因，因为如果那条毛巾被拿掉，他将完全赤裸。

"Though I've never been to a hot springs before, you usually bring a towel in with you," Shinji said, trying to sound normal.

“虽然我从未去过温泉，但你通常会带一条毛巾进去，”真嗣说，试图表现得正常。

"What is that, some Japanese custom? Why bother if you just have a bathing suit?"

“那是什么，日本的习俗吗？如果只是穿泳衣，何必多此一举？”

After she finished, Asuka's words hung in the air for several seconds of silence, before realization seemed to dawn on her.

她讲完后，明日香的话语在几秒钟的沉默中悬而未决，随后她似乎恍然大悟。

"...Shinji, you're not..."

"...真嗣，你不是..."

"Well, I didn't expect you to come in here so-"

"嗯，我没想到你会这么进来-"

"Idiot!" shouted Asuka, her face turning bright red. Shinji meanwhile had already accepted the situation, and decided to just let it happen. Though it was still rather unexpected when Asuka's hand appeared out of nowhere and slapped him.

"笨蛋！" 明日香喊道，她的脸变得通红。与此同时，真嗣已经接受了现状，决定顺其自然。尽管明日香的手突然出现并扇了他一巴掌，这仍然相当出乎意料。

That quickly put an end to the mixed gender bathing situation. Afterwards, Asuka had stormed out in a huff, declaring that if he wasn't ready by the time she was done changing, she'd leave without him. Shinji highly doubted that Asuka was serious about this, but he left the springs and changed back into his clothes all the same. After leaving the changing room, he waited a couple of minutes for Asuka, who by the time she came out, was still seething over what had happened, and was muttering darkly the whole time. In the end though, Shinji had gotten Asuka back for what she had pulled, so he wasn't terribly put off by the whole thing.

这很快结束了混浴的情况。之后，明日香气冲冲地走了出去，宣称如果他在她换好衣服之前还没准备好，她就自己离开。真嗣很怀疑明日香是认真的，但他还是离开了温泉，换回了衣服。离开更衣室后，他等了几分钟，明日香出来时，仍然对发生的事情耿耿于怀，一路上都在低声咒骂。不过最终，真嗣还是让明日香为她的所作所为付出了代价，所以他并没有太在意这件事。

Returning to their car, they argued the whole way about where to go next. They could go left at the split in the road, or return south towards a more populous area. They both agreed that there wouldn't be anything but another smaller town if they took the left road, but returning further south also had its own problems. They didn't want to drive too far into Kyoto, and lose everything that the country side had to offer, but it seemed that finding a house in the country would also be difficult. Still, they agreed to drive further south at the very least.

Though they didn't spend as much time as was intended at the hot springs, it was now afternoon, around one o'clock or so. If they had any intention of finding a home before dark, they had to do so soon.

虽然他们在温泉的时间没有预期的那么长，但现在已是下午一点左右。如果他们打算在天黑前找到住处，那么必须尽快行动。

Trees rushed by them as Asuka drove further south until they started to see smaller communities that they had passed on the way up. None of these interesting them, so they continued driving further south. Several turnoffs flashed by them, but still, they didn't have any intention of leaving the main highway.

树木在他们身边疾驰而过，明日香继续向南行驶，直到他们开始看到沿途经过的一些小型社区。这些地方无一引起他们的兴趣，于是他们继续向南行驶。几个岔路口在他们眼前闪过，但他们仍无意离开主干道。

As they were nearing the first community they looked at though, Shinji glanced out his window and saw a sign indicating a town at the next turnoff. The trees further in the mountains had disappeared behind them, and several long stretches of farmland now began appearing in front of them.

当他们接近第一个社区时，真嗣瞥向窗外，看到一个指示下一个岔路口有城镇的路标。山中的树木已消失在他们身后，取而代之的是前方开始出现的几片广阔农田。

"Asuka pull off up here," said Shinji, pointing to the offramp.

“明日香，在这里拐出去，”真嗣指着出口说道。

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"I wanna check out the town over there," said Shinji as he pointed out the window. Asuka glanced towards where he was pointing, but wasn't really sure that this was wise.

"我想去那边的小镇看看，" 真嗣指着窗外说道。明日香朝他指的方向瞥了一眼，但并不确定这样做是否明智。

"If you say so," she said, shrugged, and took the offramp. Hooking a left, they drove over the highway and began speeding down the small road. Farmland began passing them, complete with western style farms houses, and Shinji was beginning to wonder what a place that seemed straight out of Midwestern America was doing here.

“既然你这么说，”她答道，耸了耸肩，驶上了出口匝道。左转后，他们越过高速公路，开始在小路上疾驰。农田开始从旁掠过，西式农舍点缀其间，这让真嗣不禁疑惑，一个宛如美国中西部直出的地方，为何会出现在这里。

After Second Impact, much of Japan was changed to accommodate the relocation of most of the Japanese people to Tokyo-2 and later Tokyo-3. With all the coastal cities being decimated, and these being the many commercial hubs on the island, much of inland Japan was changed into farmland. Not only that, but Japan saw an increase in foreigner activity, largely within Tokyo-2 and Tokyo-3. Because of these things, a higher production rate of produce was required to feed the sudden change in population. Being influenced by western architecture and the surge in foreigners, western style farm houses began springing up all over Japan, mainly consisting of large families. It wasn't unheard of either for foreigners to permanently settle on the island.

第二次冲击后，为了适应大部分日本人迁移到东京-2 和后来的东京-3，日本许多地区发生了变化。沿海城市几乎被摧毁，这些城市曾是岛上的众多商业中心，因此内陆日本大部分地区被改造成了农田。不仅如此，日本还见证了外国人活动的增加，主要集中在东京-2 和东京-3。由于这些变化，需要提高农产品产量以满足人口的突然变化。受到西方建筑风格和外国人涌入的影响，西式农舍开始在日本各地涌现，主要由大家庭居住。外国人永久定居在岛上也不再是稀罕事。

They had, however, already ruled out the possibility of a farmhouse, which made all this seem rather pointless. But as they drove further towards the town, their minds began to change.

然而，他们已经排除了农舍的可能性，这让这一切显得有些多余。但随着他们继续向城镇驶去，他们的想法开始改变。

The road they were on began winding its way back north, so that they could see the edge of the forest as they drove. The farmland steadily began to dwindle down, as the acreage seemed less and less apparent, and trees began rising on all sides of them. Soon, they passed under a pair of power lines, that disappeared into a large group of trees, appearing to go straight up the mountain to their left. As they rounded a corner, the first building came into sight.

他们行驶的道路开始蜿蜒向北，因此他们能边开车边看到森林的边缘。农田逐渐减少，土地似乎越来越不明显，四周开始出现树木。不久，他们穿过了一对高压电线，电线消失在一群大树中，看起来直通左侧的山上。当他们转过一个弯时，第一座建筑映入眼帘。

By first appearances, it was a western style house, but as Asuka slowed down as they passed it, it appeared to be a restaurant of some kind. The name didn't give any indication as to what they served, but the name was in both Japanese, and English. Seeing this, both Shinji and Asuka began feeling excited.

乍一看，那是一座西式房屋，但随着明日香减速经过，它似乎是一家餐厅。店名并未透露他们提供什么食物，但名字同时用日文和英文书写。看到这一幕，真嗣和明日香都开始感到兴奋。

As they drove further into town, it became apparent that the road they were on went all the way through this town, and into the next. Nearly all the buildings were western with a few of Japanese origin here and there. Choosing a side road, Asuka swung left, and turned onto what appeared to be the main street. The road cut straight through the middle of town, and up a small hill, where many houses were positioned, nearly all western style. It seemed to be a community of western and Japanese people. Driving more through the small town, it was revealed that it had its own grocery store as well, but this would come later.

当他们驱车深入小镇，显而易见，他们所行驶的道路贯穿整个小镇，并延伸至下一个城镇。几乎所有的建筑都是西式风格，间或点缀着几座日式建筑。阿斯卡选择了一条岔路，向左一拐，驶入了看似是主街的道路。这条路笔直地穿过小镇中心，并延伸至一座小山丘上，那里坐落着许多房屋，几乎全是西式风格。这里似乎是一个西方人与日本人共居的社区。继续穿梭于小镇之中，他们发现这里也有自己的杂货店，不过那要稍后再说。

Finding a suitable spot to park, Shinji and Asuka got out, and examined this new environment.

找到合适的停车地点后，真嗣和明日香下了车，开始打量这个新环境。

"What do you think?" Asuka asked first.

"你怎么看？" 明日香率先问道。

"Its hard to tell from what we've only seen, but there is probably something around here that we could find."

"仅凭我们所见很难判断，但这里很可能有什么东西是我们能找到的。"

"Agreed," said Asuka. "同意，" 明日香说。

Ignoring what constituted the small downtown part, they spent most of their time driving around the neighborhood on top of the hill. Most of the houses were single story, though each one of them had a garage. Once or twice Asuka stopped the car so they could examine a house in closer detail, but they always decided to continue driving onward.

他们大部分时间都在山顶的社区里开车兜风，忽略了构成小镇中心的那一小部分。大多数房子都是单层的，尽管每栋房子都有一个车库。有一次或两次，明日香停下来，让他们可以更仔细地观察一栋房子，但他们总是决定继续向前行驶。

The town had two roads which cut through it, and straight up the hill to where Shinji and Asuka were. Crisscrossing these roads were many more which constituted the entirety of the neighborhood. Nearly all the house were of a neutral color such as white or tan, with a few lightish grey. Each had its own small yard, though each house was directly adjacent to the next, not allowing for much room between them.

小镇有两条路贯穿其中，直通向真嗣和明日香所在的山顶。这些道路纵横交错，构成了整个社区的脉络。几乎所有的房子都是中性的颜色，如白色或米色，少数是浅灰色。每栋房子都有自己的小院子，尽管每栋房子都紧挨着下一栋，没有太多的空间隔开。

After scouring much of the area, Asuka took a left onto one of the crossing roads, and followed it up another hill. The hill wound its way up, passing many trees with several driveways that led deeper into the forest. When they appeared on top of the hill, more trees greeted them, but from how straight the road was, it was flat for as far as they could see. Up here, further above the small town, the houses were spaced further apart and had much more land. Finding a small shoulder, Asuka pulled off the road and parked the car, then turned to Shinji.

在仔细搜寻了大部分区域后，明日香向左拐上了一条交叉路，沿着它又爬上了一座小山。山路蜿蜒而上，途经许多树木和几条通往森林深处的车道。当他们到达山顶时，迎接他们的是更多的树木，但由于道路笔直，他们能看到的都是平坦的景象。在这里，远离小镇的高处，房屋间隔更远，拥有更多的土地。找到一个小路肩后，明日香将车驶离道路停下，然后转向真嗣。

"So, do you want to continued driving in this direction, or return to the highway and drive closer to Kyoto?"

“那么，你想继续沿着这个方向开车，还是返回高速公路，离京都更近一些？”

Shinji wished that she wouldn't ask for his opinion, because he wasn't honestly sure. If they returned to the highway, than they would certainly have more options to choose from, but this place also had a certain calm and secluded feel to it that he was curious about.

真嗣希望她不要征求他的意见，因为他真的不确定。如果他们返回高速公路，那么他们肯定会有更多的选择，但这个地方也有一种宁静和隐秘的感觉，让他感到好奇。

"Lets continue on for a while longer," he eventually decided.

“我们再继续走一会儿吧，”他最终决定道。

Asuka nodded, and put the car in gear again, skidding off the shoulder and onto the road once again. The long stretch of road seemed to continue on forever, with sparse houses here and there, but from the glimpses than they got, neither decided it warranted it a look.

明日香点点头，再次挂上档，车子滑离路肩，重新回到公路上。这条漫长的道路似乎永无止境，零星散布着几座房屋，但从他们瞥见的景象来看，两人都认为不值得停下来细看。

Just as they were tempted to turn around and return to the highway, they saw a road that wasn't a driveway appearing slowly on their right. Without saying a word, Asuka slowed down and took the turn sharply, shifting down several gears. To the side of the road they had just turned on, a single sign indicated that this was a dead end. From what they could see, the road slopped downwards into a valley of sorts, so they were parked on top of a hill currently.

正当他们犹豫是否该掉头返回高速公路时，右侧缓缓出现了一条非私人车道的小路。阿斯卡未发一言，猛地减速急转，连降数挡。他们刚驶入的路旁，一块孤零零的指示牌表明此路不通。从眼前所见，这条路蜿蜒下坡，通向一处谷地，而他们此刻正停驻在一座小山之巅。

"What do you think?" asked Asuka.

“你觉得呢？”明日香问道。

"Couldn't hurt to look." “看看也无妨。”

Having agreed on this, Asuka slowly let the car coast down the hill while she had her foot on the break. At the bottom of the hill, the road split in two, one road turning left, and the other right. Intending to take the left, Asuka didn't drive far past the initial turn, before she slammed on the break, bringing them to a sudden stop. Shinji would have liked to have said something in regards to her driving, but he found himself understanding why she had stopped suddenly. On their left, was a dense forest of trees that seemed to prevent any sunlight from passing through, but on the right, just passed a narrow group of trees, they could see a house emerging from a clearing. Turning into the driveway, Asuka stopped the car, and they slowly got out.

达成一致后，明日香缓缓让车子沿山坡滑行，脚踩着刹车。在山脚处，道路分岔成两条，一条向左，另一条向右。打算走左边的明日香，在转弯后不久便猛踩刹车，让车子骤然停下。真嗣本想对她的驾驶方式说些什么，但他发现自己理解她为何突然停车。在他们左边，是一片茂密的树林，似乎阻挡了所有阳光的穿透，但在右边，经过一小片狭窄的树木后，他们可以看到一栋房子从一片空地中显现出来。驶入车道，明日香停下车，他们慢慢下了车。

It was a two story house, perched on the corner of the split in the road, and seemed to have driveways for both sides of the road, but this seemed to be the main driveway. The house was a light grey, built fairly recently, with a modest yard and garden that was surrounded by a clump of trees. The driveway they had parked on lead up to a garage door, with a car already parked in front of it.

这是一座两层楼的房子，坐落在道路分岔的拐角处，似乎为道路两侧都设有车道，但这条似乎是主车道。房子是浅灰色的，建成不久，有一个朴素的院子和花园，四周环绕着一片树木。他们停车的车道通向一个车库门，门前已经停了一辆车。

Looking silently up to the house that had two windows facing towards Shinji and Asuka, both looked at each before walking around the backside of the house. It had a patio that seemed to run around the length of the house with a table and several chairs, with a sliding glass door on the back, and large windows peering into what appeared to be the kitchen, dining room, and living room. Trying the sliding glass door, Shinji tugged on it multiple times, but it appeared to be locked. Though it would be easy to break in, AT-field or not, Shinji judged that destroying any part of this house would be unwise.

默默仰望着那座有两扇窗户朝向真嗣和明日香的房屋，两人对视一眼后绕到了屋后。那里有一个似乎环绕整个房屋长度的露台，摆放着一张桌子和几把椅子，后方是一扇滑动玻璃门，以及窥视着厨房、餐厅和客厅的大窗户。真嗣尝试拉动滑动玻璃门，多次用力却似乎上了锁。尽管用 AT 力场或不用都容易破门而入，但真嗣判断破坏房屋的任何部分都是不明智的。

Continuing to walk around the house, they stepped onto the other driveway from the other road. It was a circular driveway that looped around, though the front door seemed to be here. Trying the door which was white and had white wooden trim around it, Shinji tugged on this as well to no avail.

继续在房子周围走动，他们从另一条路踏上了另一条车道。这是一条环形车道，绕了一圈，尽管前门似乎就在这里。试着推了推那扇白色、四周镶有白色木饰的门，真嗣也用力拉了拉，但同样无济于事。

Returning to the driveway where they had parked, they saw what they had initially missed. To the side of the garage, was a door that clearly opened into the garage. Trying this as well, Shinji found that the doorknob turned easily, and the door swung open. No cars were parked inside the garage, and it was largely devoid of anything that would constitute junk. Glancing over at Asuka, she nodded once, before they both stepped in, and closed the door behind them.

回到他们停车的地方，他们注意到了起初忽略的东西。车库旁边有一扇门，显然是通往车库的。试着转动门把手，真嗣发现它轻松地转开了，门也随之打开。车库里没有停放任何车辆，基本上也没有什么杂物。他瞥了一眼明日香，她点了下头，随后他们一同进入，并关上了身后的门。

There was a musky smell that entered their nostrils, which was assumed since nobody had been in here in months, but it was a garage as well, so this was somewhat expect. To their left, a white door which was presumably connected to the house was closed against them. Stepping up the two steps towards it, Shinji nearly expected it to be locked, but found that it opened easily.

一股霉味钻入他们的鼻孔，这并不奇怪，毕竟这里已经几个月没人来过了，而且它还是个车库，所以这在某种程度上是可以预料的。左边有一扇白色的门，据推测是通往房子的，此刻正紧闭着。踏上通往它的两级台阶，真嗣几乎以为它会锁着，却发现它轻易地打开了。

The door opened into a storage space, two closets against the opposite wall, and to the left of these, another door. The floor was tiled, and several shoes of varying sizes were placed on a rack beside the door. Though this wasn't their first experience on intruding into a house where somebody once lived, the whole experience still felt strange, even now. Opening the door, they stepped into the new house they discovered.

门后是一个储物空间，对面墙边有两个壁橱，这些壁橱的左边还有另一扇门。地面铺着瓷砖，门旁的鞋架上摆放着各种尺码的鞋子。虽然这不是他们第一次闯入曾经有人居住的房子，但整个经历仍然让人觉得奇怪，即便到了现在。打开门，他们踏入了这个新发现的家中。

The ceiling was low hanging just like their previous house. From what they had seen while walking around the exterior, the kitchen, dining room, and living room were all one room, with the living room connected by an archway. The floor inside the kitchen was tiled with wood, as well as the dining room, but the living room was carpeted an off white. All the walls were white, and all the doors had white trim around them.

天花板低垂，与他们之前的房子相似。他们在屋外走动时所见，厨房、餐厅和客厅实际上是一个大房间，客厅通过一个拱形门与其它部分相连。厨房和餐厅的地板铺着木质瓷砖，而客厅则是铺着米白色的地毯。所有的墙壁都是白色的，所有的门框也都有白色的装饰线条。

Stepping further into the house, they walked the length of the initial area. The living room was the first, complete with a couch, table, and chair that reclined, along with a large T.V. that was in the far corner of the room. But far more important though, was the fireplace in the living room, opposite of the sliding glass door.

他们继续深入房子，沿着初始区域的长度走去。首先是客厅，配备了一张沙发、一张桌子和一把可躺的椅子，还有一台位于房间远角的大电视。但更为重要的是，客厅里有一个壁炉，正对着滑动玻璃门。

The kitchen was large, with plenty of counter space and cupboards. The counters were made out of granite, and the cupboards were all white. Other than this, it of course had a refrigerator, oven, sink, and dishwasher, but none of these worked of course.

厨房宽敞，拥有充足的台面和橱柜空间。台面由花岗岩制成，橱柜均为白色。除此之外，当然还有冰箱、烤箱、水槽和洗碗机，但这些设备当然都无法使用。

The dining room had a simple placement of six chairs, surrounded by one long oak table, and the chandelier which hung above it.

餐厅内摆放着六把椅子，围绕着一张长长的橡木桌，上方悬挂着一盏吊灯。

After thoroughly examining the three rooms, and checking all the cupboards, and desk drawers, Shinji and Asuka turned their attention to the rest of the house. From the door that led to the garage, to the right was the front door, and a staircase which led to the upper floors. Directly across from them, their seemed to be an office with an assortment of papers upon a large desk, and a bookshelf opposite of this. A wooden railing ran its way up the staircase, pausing briefly on a landing, before turning upwards again.

在彻底检查了三个房间，并查看了所有橱柜和书桌抽屉后，真嗣和明日香将注意力转向了房子的其他部分。从通往车库的门开始，右边是前门，以及通往楼上的楼梯。正对面似乎是一间办公室，一张大桌子上堆满了各种文件，对面是一个书架。木质栏杆沿着楼梯向上延伸，在中间的平台短暂停留后，又继续向上蜿蜒。

The upstairs had three bedrooms, one master, and the other presumably for guests or children. The one bedroom was certainly for a child's, as it had toys strewn across the floor, and the walls were brightly colored pink, making it appear that a girl once slept in this room. The other bedroom was very plain, with only the bare minimum of things like a bed and dresser.

楼上共有三间卧室，一间主卧，另一间想必是供客人或孩子使用的。其中一间显然是儿童房，因为地板上散落着玩具，墙壁被粉刷成鲜艳的粉色，似乎曾有个女孩在此安睡。另一间卧室则极为简朴，仅配备了床和梳妆台等最基本的家具。

The master bedroom was at the far opposite end of the hallway, directly above the living room, with the two windows that they had seen outside while facing the garage. A bathroom directly before the bedroom was supposedly for the rest of the houses inhabitants, but the master bedroom had its own. A double set of doors opened the way to the bedroom. A large, king sized bed stood out in the forefront, positioned directly in the center of the room. Two dressers were on opposite sides of the bed, and two small desks were directly next to the bed on opposite sides. A single large mirror rested against the wall away from the bed, and to the far left, was another set of double doors leading into the bathroom. The bathroom had both a shower and bathtub, along with a walk in closet, though this wasn't to mention the obvious sink and toilet.

主卧室位于走廊的另一端，正上方是客厅，面对车库时从外面看到的两个窗户就在这里。卧室前方的浴室据说是为房屋的其他居住者准备的，但主卧室有自己的浴室。一扇双开门通向卧室。一张大号床显眼地摆在房间中央，两侧各有一组梳妆台和两张小书桌。一面大镜子靠在远离床的墙上，而左边的远处则是另一扇双开门，通往浴室。浴室里既有淋浴间也有浴缸，还有一个步入式衣帽间，当然还有洗手池和马桶。

Though it was difficult to take this all in at once, after walking the entire length of the house from top to bottom, Asuka slowly sat onto the bed, and immediately sank into the soft mattress. Though it had only been about a week at most since she had last slept in a bed, it still felt much longer. Turning around, she sank her face into the soft blankets and let out a sigh of relief. Shinji sat down beside her and looked around the room, still taking everything in.

尽管一下子接受这一切有些困难，但在从上到下走遍了整个房子之后，明日香缓缓地坐在床上，立刻陷入了柔软的床垫中。虽然距离她上次睡在床上最多不过一周时间，却感觉像是过了很久。她转过身，将脸埋进柔软的被子里，发出了一声释然的叹息。真嗣坐在她旁边，环顾着房间，仍在努力消化眼前的一切。

"...Shinji?" came Asuka's muffled voice since her face was still buried in the blankets.

“……真嗣？”明日香的声音有些闷闷的，因为她的脸还埋在被子里。

"Yeah, I know," came Shinji slow reply.

“嗯，我知道。”真嗣缓缓地回答道。

They didn't need say anything to each other. They had found their new home.

他们无需多言。他们已找到了新的家园。

Though the daunting task of finding a new home was over with, there was still the process of it becoming theres. Just as they had done previously, any photos that showed of the previous owners, they laid down flat so that they couldn't see them. Again, they could have just as easily removed them from the house entirely, but that would have seemed insensitive.

尽管寻找新家的艰巨任务已经结束，但让它真正成为他们的家还需要一个过程。正如他们之前所做的那样，任何展示前主人照片的相框，他们都将它们平放，以免看到。同样，他们本可以轻易地将这些照片从屋内彻底移除，但那样做似乎显得不够体贴。

Next, there was the steady process of bringing everything from their car into the house and arranging everything. This was far more difficult than last time, as most of the stuff they had now was taken with them when they left Tokyo-2, but they found plenty of things that were usable as well. While Shinji spent most of his time bringing stuff into the house and garage, Asuka dusted off many of the surfaces within the house, and examined the pots, pans, and silverware in the kitchen.

接下来，他们需要将车上的所有物品搬进屋内并整理好。这比上次困难得多，因为他们现在的大部分物品都是离开东京-2 时带走的，但他们也发现了很多可用的东西。在真嗣大部分时间将物品搬进屋内和车库的同时，明日香则打扫了屋内许多表面，并检查了厨房里的锅碗瓢盆和餐具。

By now, the sun was beginning to set and most of the things had been brought in and set in order. There was a small supply of firewood left under a tarp in the garage, so Shinji used it to a start a fire in the fireplace, while Asuka brewed some tea outside on the patio. Bringing two steaming cups of tea inside through the sliding door, Asuka handed one to Shinji, and then sat down on the couch across from the fireplace. She immediately sank into the cushions, stretched out, and rested her feet on the table in front of her.

此时，太阳开始落山，大部分物品已经搬进并整理妥当。车库里有一小堆防水布下的木柴，真嗣用它点燃了壁炉里的火，而明日香则在露台上煮茶。她端着两杯冒着热气的茶通过滑动门进屋，递给真嗣一杯，然后坐在壁炉对面的沙发上。她立刻陷进靠垫里，伸展开来，将脚搁在面前的桌子上。

"I don't want to move from here," groaned Asuka.

“我不想从这里动身了，”明日香呻吟道。

"As in move off the couch, or this place in general?"

"你是说离开沙发，还是离开这个地方？"

"Both," sighed Asuka, clearly content about the situation.

"两者都有，" 明日香叹了口气，显然对这个情况感到满意。

"Well, I think that we should explore this place more, and there is the grocery store in town that we'll need to stop by. Though we can save those things for tomorrow. I'm not sure how much property is here, but its more than the house we had in Tokyo-2."

"嗯，我觉得我们应该多探索一下这个地方，还有镇上的杂货店我们也需要去一趟。不过这些可以留到明天。我不确定这里有多少地产，但肯定比我们在东京-2 的房子要多。"

"I don't care," said Asuka. "I'm just glad to not be sitting in car, or on the ground again."

“我不在乎，”明日香说，“只是很高兴不用再坐在车里，或是地上。”

Well it had been hardest on Asuka, since she had to do all the driving, though Shinji had pulled his own weight as well, what with the moving of the cars and all.

这对明日香来说最为艰难，因为她得负责所有的驾驶工作，尽管真嗣也尽了自己的一份力，包括搬运车辆等等。

"I'll probably need to get firewood as well, since we don't have enough to last us even a couple of days. At least theres plenty of trees around here."

“我可能还需要弄些柴火，因为我们现有的不够撑过几天。至少这里树木充足。”

"I'm going to assume you don't plan on using an ax," said Asuka jokingly.

“我猜你不会打算用斧头吧，”明日香开玩笑地说。

"No...I'll use my AT-field for that. At least it can be used for something useful."

“不……我会用我的 AT 力场来解决。至少它还能派上点用场。”

"Be careful when you do," mumbled Asuka.

“做的时候小心点。”明日香咕哝道。

"Even if a tree were towards me, as long as I protect myself with the dome I'd be fine."

"即便树木朝我倒来，只要我用 AT 力场保护自己，就不会有事。"

Asuka wanted to say something in this regards, but she knew very well how sturdy Shinji was, and just how powerful his AT-field was. She probably didn't need to worry about it.

明日香本想对此说些什么，但她深知真嗣的坚韧和他的 AT 力场有多强大。她大概不必为此担心。

"Well, guess I'll make dinner with the remaining food we have. I'd ask you want you want, but at this point, we've only got one option."

"好吧，我打算用剩下的食材做晚饭。虽然想问你想吃什么，但眼下我们只有一种选择。"

"Rice with chicken broth?"

“鸡汤泡饭？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Laughing lightly, Asuka said, "Its what we started on, so I guess it only fits to have it now that we have a new house."

浅笑着，明日香说道：“这是我们开始的地方，所以我想现在有了新家，吃这个正合适。”

It didn't feel real in a certain sense. Six hours ago, they were sitting in a hot springs together further up north, and now they were sitting side by side on a couch in a home that they had discovered. Though they had decided to stay here now, it would still take a couple of days for them to get used to this again.

在某种意义上，这感觉并不真实。六小时前，他们还坐在北边更远的温泉里，而现在，他们并肩坐在一个刚发现的家的沙发上。虽然他们决定现在就留在这里，但仍需要几天时间来适应这一切。

Standing up, Shinji walked into the kitchen to grab the necessary ingredients, and then walked outside on the patio to begin preparing everything.

站起身来，真嗣走进厨房拿取所需食材，随后走到露台上开始准备一切。

Asuka continued sitting slumped on the couch, thinking about their new place. Judging by what they had seen so far, a family of three used to live here: a mother, father, and a daughter somewhere around three, to six years old. The refrigerator had multiple childish drawings on it with crayons, and they had found many photos within an album while going through stuff in the master bedroom. The photos on walls and tables they had turned around or faced them down, but the drawings on the refrigerator they had left up for the time being. It had been Asuka who had left them as they were, though she couldn't rightfully explain why.

明日香继续瘫坐在沙发上，思索着他们的新住处。从目前所见来看，这里曾住着一家三口：一位母亲、一位父亲，以及一个大约三到六岁的小女孩。冰箱上贴满了蜡笔绘制的童趣画作，他们在主卧室整理物品时还发现了一本相册。墙上的照片和桌上的相框他们要么翻转要么面朝下放置，但冰箱上的画作他们暂时保留原样。正是明日香决定让它们保持原状，尽管她自己也说不清为何如此。

Setting her tea on the table, she swung her legs onto the couch and laid down. Though they hadn't been here very long, Asuka could already tell she was content in staying here. But that at the same time made her wonder as well. How long would they stay here? Another month, six months, years? Or would they ever leave? She had discussed this question with Shinji before, but they hadn't come to a conclusion yet.

将茶杯置于桌上，她将双腿挪到沙发上躺下。虽然他们在此地停留不久，明日香已能感受到内心的满足。但这也让她心生疑惑。他们会在这里停留多久？一个月，半年，还是数年？抑或永不离开？她曾与真嗣讨论过这个问题，但至今未有定论。

While Asuka pondered about this, Shinji finished making dinner, and brought in two bowls in through the sliding door. As they used to before, they ate the dinner while sitting side by side on the couch. It was much warmer by the fire than in the dining room afterall.

当明日香还在思索这个问题时，真嗣已经做好了晚饭，并端着两碗饭从滑动门进来。他们像往常一样，并肩坐在沙发上用餐。毕竟，壁炉旁的温度比餐厅里要暖和得多。

After finishing dinner, Shinji washed the dishes, while Asuka lit a few candles she had found in a box inside the walk-in closet from upstairs. There was enough to spread them around the house equally so no place was so dark that they couldn't find their way. It would still take them time to acquaint themselves with the layout of the house, so until then, and so as to not bump into stuff, they'd have the candles burning until they went to bed.

晚餐后，真嗣洗了碗，而明日香则在上层步入式衣橱的一个箱子里找到了几根蜡烛，并点燃了它们。这些蜡烛足够均匀地分布在屋内，确保没有哪个角落过于昏暗以至于找不到路。他们还需要时间熟悉房子的布局，所以在那之前，为了避免撞到东西，他们会一直点着蜡烛直到睡觉。

While Asuka was upstairs arranging the candles, Shinji had finished washing the dishes and walked in the downstairs study near the front door. Asuka had already lit a candle in there, and though it didn't seem necessary, Shinji was glad that she did, so he could have a look at the bookshelf. Their house in Tokyo-2 had its own study as well, and Shinji had read through those books so many times that he would be glad to find something new. Pulling a book off the shelf at random, he examined it by the candlelight and saw that it was a thriller of some sorts. Riffling through it for a couple of seconds, he decided that he may as well start somewhere.

当明日香在楼上摆放蜡烛时，真嗣已经洗完了碗碟，走进了靠近前门的楼下书房。明日香已经在那里点燃了一支蜡烛，虽然似乎没有必要，但真嗣很高兴她这么做，这样他就可以看看书架了。他们在东京-2 的家里也有自己的书房，真嗣已经把那些书读了无数遍，他很高兴能找到一些新的。他随手从书架上抽出一本书，借着烛光查看，发现这是一本某种类型的惊悚小说。随意翻了几页后，他决定不妨从这里开始。

Returning to the living, he began reading from page one, when he heard Asuka's footsteps coming down the stairs.

回到客厅，他开始从第一页读起，这时他听到了明日香下楼的脚步声。

"Well, all the candles are placed and I lit a few, though it seems you already knew that," said Asuka when she saw the book he was reading.

“好了，所有的蜡烛都摆好了，我也点了几支，不过看来你已经知道了，”明日香看到他正在读的书时说道。

"Yeah, thanks," said Shinji, somewhat distracted.

“嗯，谢谢。”真嗣说道，有些心不在焉。

Asuka frowned at him briefly, but then had to stifle a yawn. Though the bath earlier had been wonderful, it also made her realize how tired she had been recently. She had hardly done much the passed few days besides drive, so she was rather eager to finally sleep in a bed again.

明日香短暂地皱了皱眉，随即却不得不忍住一个哈欠。尽管之前的泡澡非常舒适，但也让她意识到自己最近有多疲惫。过去几天里她几乎没做什么，除了开车，所以她非常渴望能再次躺在床上好好睡一觉。

"Tired?" asked Shinji. "累了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah, I think I'll turn in earlier. What are you gonna do?"

“嗯，我想我会早点睡。你打算做什么？”

"Stay down here for a while I suppose. This book isn't bad."

“我想我会在这里待一会儿。这本书还不错。”

Asuka again frowned at him, and looked as though she wanted to say something. Instead, she turned away from him and said, "Well, goodnight Shinji."

明日香再次皱眉看着他，似乎想说些什么。但她转过身去，说道：“那么，晚安，真嗣。”

"Hmm, night Asuka," mumbled Shinji, clearly absorbed in his book.

“嗯，晚安，明日香。” 真嗣咕哝着，显然沉浸在他的书里。

Shinji continued reading his book until he lost track of time. It was likely sometime after ten, when he finally paused. Standing up, he grabbed something to drink and returned to the couch, sinking down in the cushions. Rubbing his eyes, he glanced over at the fireplace, thinking that he'd have to put more wood in if he intended to keep reading. Though he really should get to be soon he thought.

真嗣继续阅读他的书，直到忘记了时间。可能已经过了十点，他终于停了下来。站起来，他拿了点喝的东西，回到沙发上，陷进垫子里。揉了揉眼睛，他瞥向壁炉，想着如果他还打算继续阅读的话，就得再添些木柴。不过，他确实应该早点睡觉，他想。

He'd already read the first hundred or so pages, and it was a rather long book, so he wasn't finishing it anytime soon. Yawning widely, he stood up and returned the book to the study, blowing out the candle when he left. Doing the same in the kitchen and dining room, he sat back on the couch and propped his feet on the table.

他已经读了前一百页左右，而这本书相当长，所以他不会很快读完。打了个大大的哈欠，他站起来，把书放回书房，离开时吹灭了蜡烛。在厨房和餐厅也做了同样的事，他重新坐回沙发，把脚架在桌上。

Though he felt tired, he also felt too excited, which was why he had stayed up for so long. In truth, he wanted to walk around outside and explore the new area that they had found. It couldn't be any further from what their house in Tokyo-2 had been. Sure, there were other houses nearby, but just by looking out the windows during daytime, he couldn't see any of them since the trees blocked them from view.

尽管他感到疲惫，但内心的兴奋让他久久无法入睡。实际上，他渴望走出户外，探索他们新发现的这片区域。这里与他们在东京-2 的旧居截然不同。诚然，附近也有其他房屋，但白天透过窗户望去，由于树木的遮挡，他根本看不到任何一户人家。

Standing up, he opened the sliding door and stepped outside onto the patio. Looking up, he could clearly see the stars, which wasn't different compared to their old house, but the scenery was different. With the moon out, parts of the grassy lawn behind their house were illumined along with the trees that surrounded them. Shinji wondered what was beyond the row of trees behind their house, as it didn't seem like another house, and he was nearly tempted to walk towards the tree line when the sliding glass door opened behind him.

他站起身，拉开滑动门，踏出屋外来到露台上。抬头望去，繁星清晰可见，这与他们旧居并无二致，但景致却截然不同。月光洒下，屋后草坪的一部分以及环绕四周的树木被照亮。真嗣好奇屋后那一排树木之外是什么，那里似乎并非另一座房屋，他几乎想要走向树丛边缘，就在这时，身后的滑动玻璃门打开了。

Turning around, he was somewhat surprised to see Asuka standing their, considering he thought she went to sleep hours ago. Whats more, she was only wearing a white shirt and shorts that weren't suited for the temperature outside.

转过身来，他有些惊讶地看到明日香站在那里，毕竟他以为她几小时前就睡了。更甚的是，她只穿着一件白衬衫和短裤，这身打扮可不适合外面的气温。

"I thought you went to sleep Asuka?" wondered Shinji.

“我以为你睡了，明日香？”真嗣疑惑地问。

He didn't get a reply from her, but she walked closer to him, and suddenly grabbed his hand. As he was about to ask her whether something was wrong, Asuka tugged on his hand, pulling him through the sliding door. Shinji hardly had time to close it before Asuka started tugging him towards the staircase, throughout which he tried asking her why she was doing this. She didn't seem in the mood to reply however.

他没有得到她的回答，但她走近了他，突然抓住了他的手。正当他准备问她是否有什么不对劲时，明日香拉住他的手，拽着他穿过滑动门。真嗣几乎没有时间关上门，明日香就开始拉着他朝楼梯走去，一路上他试图问她为什么要这么做。然而，她似乎没有心情回答。

Dragging him up the stairs, Shinji stumbled over his feet multiple times, but Asuka didn't stop for him. Down the hallway they went, and when they reached the door to the master bedroom, Asuka kicked it open, where it bounced off the wall and caught Shinji in the foot as she dragged him through it. Finally, she threw him down on the bed and stood over him.

拖着他上楼，真嗣多次绊倒，但明日香没有停下来等他。他们沿着走廊走，当到达主卧室的门前时，明日香一脚踢开门，门弹到墙上，还撞到了真嗣的脚，她拽着他进了房间。最后，她把他扔到床上，站在他上方。

"Asuka, what are you doing?" Shinji said, having to fight to keep his tone normal. It was like she had done a complete one eighty in her personality in the short time he hadn't seen her.

"Asuka，你在干什么？" 真嗣说道，努力保持语气的正常。她在他没见她的短短时间里，性格简直来了个一百八十度大转变。

But instead of replying, Asuka threw herself on top of him, crushing her body against his. Not expecting this in the slightest, Shinji let out a surprised yell, and nearly swore, but Asuka began speaking then.

但阿斯卡并没有回答，而是扑到他身上，将她的身体紧紧压在他身上。完全没有预料到这一点的真嗣惊叫出声，差点就要咒骂，但阿斯卡随即开始说话。

"God, you can be so air headed sometimes Shinji."

"天啊，真嗣，你有时候真是迟钝得可以。"

Looking up at her, Shinji saw that she was straddling his waste now, though a heavy frown was on her face.

抬头看着她，真嗣发现她现在正跨坐在他的腰上，尽管她的脸上带着沉重的皱眉。

"I thought you went to sleep," repeated Shinji, not sure how they ended up in this position.

“我以为你去睡觉了，”真嗣重复道，不确定他们是怎么变成这个姿势的。

"I've been lying awake up here, waiting for you for the past two hours you damn idiot!"

"我在这儿躺着睡不着，已经等你两个小时了，你这个该死的白痴！"

"...Oh," mumbled Shinji. "...哦，" 真嗣嘟囔道。"

"Thats all you can say?"

"你就只能说这个？"

"...Sorry." “……对不起。”

Losing her patience, Asuka started pounding her fists against his chest, repeatedly calling him an idiot, airhead, and blockhead. Shinji's protests didn't stop her, and finally he grabbed her shoulders, and flipped her around on the bed so that their positions were reversed.

失去耐心的明日香开始用拳头猛击他的胸膛，反复骂他是白痴、笨蛋和傻瓜。真嗣的抗议并未让她停手，最终他抓住她的肩膀，将她翻倒在床上，两人的位置就此颠倒。

"Get off me," grumbled Asuka.

“从我身上下来，”明日香咕哝道。

"Make me," grinned Shinji.

“你试试看，”真嗣咧嘴笑道。

Asuka tried just that, though it proved much more difficult now that Shinji understood what was happening. They tussled like that on the bed for multiple minutes, switching positions constantly and pinning the other down. Finally, Shinji gave in after around the sixth time and let Asuka win. He wasn't tired, but Asuka was so stubborn that she would have continued until she passed out from tiredness. Even so, with her face slightly glistening in sweat, Asuka didn't bother getting off of him, and collapsed upon his chest.

明日香确实尝试了，但现在真嗣明白了发生了什么，这变得困难多了。他们在床上这样扭打了几分钟，不断变换位置，试图压制对方。最终，在第六次左右，真嗣放弃了，让明日香赢了。他并不累，但明日香太固执了，她会一直继续直到累倒为止。即便如此，尽管她的脸颊因汗水微微发亮，明日香也没有从他身上下来的意思，而是倒在他的胸口上。

"I win," said Asuka, panting lightly while laying upon him.

"我赢了," 明日香轻喘着气，躺在他身上说道。

"If you say so," sighed Shinji.

"随你怎么说吧," 真嗣叹了口气。

"Somehow, the way you said that makes me angry. So, you understand now?"

"你这么一说，我反而更生气了。那么，你现在明白了吗？"

Shinji didn't say anything, though he did. Essentially, when Asuka said she was going to sleep, she wanted Shinji to come up with her.

真嗣没有说什么，尽管他确实应该说点什么。本质上，当明日香说她要去睡觉时，她是希望真嗣能和她一起上去。

"You could have asked you know?" mumbled Shinji.

“你知道，你本可以问的。”真嗣咕哝道。

"And you could have understood," said Asuka. "Well, whatever."

"你本可以理解的，" 明日香说道。"算了，无所谓。"

Letting out a sigh, Asuka breathed heavily into his chest, and then exhaled. His sent filled her nostrils, reminding her that he was here with her.

明日香叹了口气，深深地呼吸着他的胸膛，然后缓缓呼出。他的气息充满了她的鼻腔，提醒着她他就在这里与她同在。

"Asuka is it alright if I get up?"

"明日香，我可以起来了吗？"

"...I don't want you to."

“……我不想你这么做。”

"I'm not going to sleep wearing pants."

"我睡觉可不穿裤子。"

"...Fine," said Asuka, though she didn't seem to like this change.

"...好吧，" 明日香说道，尽管她对这个变化似乎不太满意。

Removing his pants and pulling on some shorts over his boxers, Shinji didn't notice that Asuka didn't even bother looking away, but just crawled to the head of the bed, and rested her head on a pillow, waiting for him to get in bed.

脱下裤子，套上短裤，真嗣没注意到明日香根本没转过头去，只是爬到床头，把头靠在枕头上，等着他上床。

Slipping under the covers next to Asuka, Shinji yawned, and then looked over at Asuka to see her grinning widely.

滑进被窝躺在明日香旁边，真嗣打了个哈欠，然后转头看向明日香，只见她正咧嘴大笑。

"I thought you were tired?" asked Shinji.

“我以为你很累呢？”真嗣问道。

"I still am, though this is funny in its on way. Plus I'm thinking about tomorrow."

“我还是挺累的，不过这事儿有它自己的趣味。而且我在想明天的事。”

"Yeah, I am too I suppose."

"是啊，我想我也是。"

Moving herself closer to Shinji, Asuka looked across to him and said, "I think I missed this as well."

阿斯卡挪近了真嗣，望着他说：“我也觉得我错过了这个。”

"Isn't this normal now?" "现在不应该是常态了吗？"

"I was talking about the bed," smirked Asuka.

“我说的是床。”明日香轻蔑地笑了笑。

Shinji was glad to know that she was in a good mood, though he wished she could letup on the teasing a bit. She'd already given him hell earlier in the day afterall.

真嗣很高兴知道她心情不错，尽管他希望她能稍微减少一些戏弄。毕竟，她今天早些时候已经让他够受的了。

"Well...this has its own plus. Anyway, night Shinji."

“嗯...这也有它的好处。总之，晚安，真嗣。”

"Yeah, night Asu-" “嗯，晚安，阿苏——”

Though Asuka was leaning against him, she wasn't directly parallel with him, and instead was looking up towards him. Shinji, who had already started drifting off to sleep at this point, was hardly paying attention to the conversation, and his consciousness was starting to waver. When Asuka's lips made contact with his cheek though, it woke him up immensely.

尽管明日香靠在他身上，但她并没有与他直接平行，而是抬头望着他。此时，真嗣已经开始昏昏欲睡，几乎没在听对话，意识也开始飘忽。然而，当明日香的唇触碰到他的脸颊时，他瞬间清醒了过来。

Looking down at her, he saw that Asuka's face was pressed firmly against his chest, hiding whatever expression she was making. Her cheek was in full view though, and Shinji was tempted to reply to her in kind, though he settled for resting his head against her own. He wasn't sure if she had expected something else, but this was at most what he felt like doing.

他低头看着她，只见明日香的脸紧紧贴在他的胸前，隐藏了她此刻的表情。但她的脸颊完全展现在他眼前，真嗣本想以同样的方式回应她，但最终只是将自己的头靠在她的头上。他不确定她是否期待着别的什么，但这最多只是他此刻想做的事情。

'I feel like I've been lead around by her all day,' thought Shinji, sighing internally.

'我感觉一整天都被她牵着鼻子走，'真嗣内心叹息道。

Whether that was true or not, they had finally found a new house, with an entirely new environment. Shinji didn't know what tomorrow would bring, but he was excited for it nonetheless.

无论这是否属实，他们终于找到了一个全新的房子，拥有一个完全新的环境。真嗣不知道明天会带来什么，但他仍然对此感到兴奋。

### Chapter 23: Intensity

Feel like I'm on a bit of a roll lately, so continuing with that, here's another chapter. Likely gonna be another chapter this month, if possible sometime around Christmas, but I've got some stuff to say at the end of anyway.

感觉最近状态不错，所以继续保持，这是另一篇 chapter。如果可能的话，这个月可能还会有另一篇 chapter，大概在圣诞节前后，不过无论如何，我最后有些话要说。

---

The next day started bright and early, though when Shinji first got up, he had briefly forgotten where he was. Memories of the previous day surged back into his mind, and that was when he saw the small lump sleeping beside him. During the night, Asuka had apparently turned away from him, and pulled most of the covers over to her side. Well, this wasn't the first time this had happened, so Shinji wasn't put off by it.

第二天一大早，真嗣醒来时，一时竟忘了自己在哪儿。昨日的记忆涌入脑海，这时他看到了身旁熟睡的小小身影。夜里，明日香显然是转过身去，把大部分被子都拉到了她那边。好吧，这种情况已经不是第一次了，所以真嗣并没有因此感到困扰。

Being careful not to wake her as he stepped out of bed, he quietly put some pants on, and left the room. Sunlight streamed through the windows along the hallway as he walked towards the stairs, and he briefly stopped and looked out them. Seeing the edge of the tree line, he decided that he'd venture through them later today, but first came breakfast.

他小心翼翼地从床上起身，生怕吵醒她，悄悄地穿上裤子，离开了房间。阳光沿着走廊的窗户洒下，他走向楼梯时，短暂地停下脚步向外望去。看到树线的边缘，他决定今天稍后会去那里探险，但首先得吃早餐。

Walking downstairs and out onto the back patio, he reheated the rice they hadn't finished yesterday, and started a pot a tea of as well. Sitting on one of the wicker chairs, he sipped his tea slowly, waiting in part for the rice to finish, and for Asuka to wake up. Briefly, he thought about the kiss last night. Though it had only been on the cheek, there was a certain tenderness to it that was conveyed through Asuka's feelings. There was a lot of things left unsaid between them, but Shinji wasn't in any hurry to rush things. Things were progressing smoothly enough, and he didn't want to screw things up somehow.

他走下楼，来到后院的露台上，重新加热了昨天没吃完的米饭，并开始煮一壶茶。坐在一张柳条椅上，他慢慢啜饮着茶，部分是为了等待米饭煮好，也是为了等明日香醒来。他短暂地回想起昨晚的那个吻。虽然只是亲在脸颊上，但明日香传递出的那份温柔却异常真切。他们之间还有许多未说出口的话，但真嗣并不急于推进关系。一切都在平稳地发展，他不想因为急躁而搞砸了什么。

While starting on his own bowl, the sliding glass door opened, revealing Asuka, who still didn't seem to be fully awake.

当他开始吃自己的那碗饭时，滑动玻璃门打开了，明日香出现在门口，看起来似乎还没完全清醒。

"Morning," Shinji said brightly, though all he got out of her was a low grunt. After handing her a bowl of rice and a cup of tea though, she started waking up.

“早上好，”真嗣明快地说道，尽管她只回以一声低沉的咕哝。不过，递给她一碗米饭和一杯茶后，她开始醒过来了。

"So what's the plan for today?" asked Asuka between mouthfuls.

“那今天有什么计划？”明日香边吃边问。

"The obvious thing is to go into town and stock up on food. Other than that, I wanted to walk through the group of trees over there, and the neighborhood in general," said Shinji, gesturing with his spoon. "And I need to get firewood as well I suppose."

“显而易见的是进城采购食物。除此之外，我想穿过那片树林，还有在附近街区走走，”真嗣说着，用勺子比划了一下。“我想我还得弄些柴火。”

"Did you want to drive around, or...?"

"你想开车转转，还是...？"

"It doesn't seemed like there's much around here, so walking should be fine. I can get the firewood later."

"这里看起来没什么可逛的，走路应该就可以了。柴火我晚点再去捡。"

"Sounds good to me." "我同意。"

After finishing breakfast, Asuka went upstairs and grabbed herself a sweatshirt, the one that she had carried from Tokyo-3. Shinji of course went without one, being content in jeans and a t-shirt.

早餐后，明日香上楼拿了一件运动衫，那是她从东京-3 带来的。真嗣当然没穿外套，只穿着牛仔裤和 T 恤就满意了。

Leaving from the sliding door, they walked to the edge of the driveway where their car was still parked, and had to decide which way to go. From the driveway, they could see that the road curved left slightly passed their house, and then went slopping further downwards. More driveways leading to different houses poked out from groups of trees, but Shinji and Asuka decided to take the other road.

他们从滑动门离开，走到车道尽头，那里还停着他们的车，需要决定走哪条路。从车道上，他们可以看到道路在经过他们家后稍微向左弯曲，然后继续向下倾斜。更多的车道从树丛中伸出，通往不同的房子，但真嗣和明日香决定走另一条路。

Walking to the front of the house, they walked up the circular driveway, and looked down the road. They had missed it before, but there was another house directly across from them. It was hidden so well by the trees in their front yard, and the trees around it, that even if you drove passed it, there was no guarantee you would see it. Pine needles covered the road leading up, and it seemed that sunlight never pierced through the close row of trees that surrounded the house. It was difficult to imagine somebody had even lived there at one point.

走到房子前面，他们沿着环形车道走上去，俯瞰道路。之前他们没注意到，对面直接有一栋房子。它被前院和周围的树木遮蔽得如此之好，即使你开车经过，也无法保证你会看到它。松针覆盖了通往那里的道路，似乎阳光从未穿透过环绕房子的紧密排列的树木。很难想象曾经有人在那里居住过。

Ignoring this house for now, they walked further down the road. More houses entered their vision, one with a circular driveway such as theirs, though with a house significantly smaller. Two large trees towered in the front yard, and on either side, more trees surrounded it. The house was an even lighter gray than theirs, though this might have been weatherworn from the rain. Something that sparked Shinji's interest though, was the white truck within the front driveway. It wasn't large by any means, but it could certainly hold a sizable amount of firewood.

暂时忽略这栋房子，他们沿着道路继续前行。更多的房屋映入眼帘，其中一栋有着与他们相似的圆形车道，尽管房子明显小了许多。前院矗立着两棵参天大树，两侧也被更多的树木环绕。这栋房子的灰色比他们的更浅，尽管这可能是雨水侵蚀的结果。然而，引起真嗣注意的是前车道上的白色卡车。虽然不大，但绝对能装下相当数量的木柴。

Making a mental note for later, they walked on. The road continued straight, with trees rising on all sides of them, and it wasn't until they rounded a corner that they saw another house on their right, as well as the end of the road. The house was far back in a clearing, but had a fence directly up against the road made of wood. The driveway was at the end of the road, with tall hedgerows surrounding it on either side, as well as an iron gate at the entrance which was wide open.

他们记在心里，打算稍后再说，继续前行。道路笔直延伸，四周树木林立，直到他们转过一个弯，才在右侧看到另一栋房子，以及路的尽头。那房子远远地坐落在一个空地上，但紧贴着路的栅栏是用木头做的。车道位于路的尽头，两侧高高的树篱环绕，入口处有一扇敞开的铁门。

Walking up the narrow driveway, they soon crossed a small bridge that had a small creak running under it, and the pond on their right which seemed to be the source. The house was different than the others they had seen, the foundation being made of brick, and the dark brown siding, along with the black roofing. Along the right side was a porch, raised several feet off the ground since the house was built on a slope. The back side of the house had a small barn, surrounded by more trees, but to the right side of the porch, was a swimming pool. Asuka would have liked to have dove right in, but it was covered by a tarp, and Shinji reminded her that it would likely need to be cleaned.

沿着狭窄的车道缓步上行，他们很快穿过了一座小桥，桥下潺潺流水发出轻微的吱嘎声，而右侧的池塘似乎便是源头。这座房子与他们之前见过的有所不同，地基由砖石砌成，深褐色的外墙，搭配黑色的屋顶。右侧建有一座门廊，因房屋建于斜坡之上，故而高出地面数英尺。房屋后侧有一间小谷仓，四周树木环绕，但在门廊右侧，却设有一个游泳池。明日香本想立刻跳进去畅游一番，但泳池被防水布覆盖着，而真嗣提醒她，这池子很可能需要先清理一番。

Briefly thinking about entering the house, they instead doubled back to their own home, though Asuka pointed out that if they wanted to get everything done with today, they'd best skip the other road. Shinji didn't think so, but resigned to her when she started to get testy.

短暂考虑了一下进屋，他们最终还是折返回家，尽管明日香指出如果他们想今天把所有事情都搞定，最好绕过另一条路。真嗣并不这么认为，但当明日香开始显得不耐烦时，他还是顺从了她。

After stopping inside their own house for a brief moment, they made their way towards the edge of the tree line behind their own house. Peering through the trees, they couldn't see anything but darkness, and wondered how far the trees went, or if they never stopped until the other side of the mountain.

在自己家中稍作停留后，他们朝着自家屋后树线的边缘走去。透过树木，他们只能看到一片黑暗，不禁好奇这些树木究竟延伸多远，或者是否一直绵延到山的另一侧。

While exploring the edge though, Asuka found what seemed to be a path that looked as though it hadn't been used in a while. Weeds and grass grew on either side, but their was a distinct trail through the brush. Glancing over at Shinji, he shrugged once, before leading the way.

在探索边缘时，明日香发现了一条看似久未有人踏足的小径。两侧杂草丛生，但灌木丛中明显有一条小道。她瞥了一眼真嗣，他耸了耸肩，随即带头前行。

If the trail had once been well tended, it was no longer. As they reached further into the dense forest, the foliage on either side of them grew denser and denser so that soon Shinji was wishing he had a pair of clippers with him. Asuka was even starting to complain about the branches that were getting caught in her hair, though when Shinji suggested they turn back, she just tucked her hair into her sweatshirt, and barreled on.

如果这条小径曾经被精心维护，那么现在已不复如此。随着他们深入茂密的森林，两侧的植被愈发浓密，不久后，真嗣便开始渴望手边有一对修枝剪。明日香甚至开始抱怨那些缠住她头发的树枝，尽管当真嗣提议返回时，她只是将头发塞进运动衫里，继续前行。

When they were so far away from the house that it felt like they had been walking for an hour or so, Shinji finally stopped dead in his tracks and turned towards Asuka, knowing that turning around was the only option they had. Asuka on the other hand, walked passed him, hardly seeing him, peering through the trees because she had seen a streak of sunlight. Following her slowly at first, Shinji saw what her eyes had seen, and minutes later, they burst out into a sizable clearing.

当他们离房子如此之远，感觉已经走了大约一个小时的时候，真嗣终于停下了脚步，转身面向明日香，知道转身是他们唯一的选择。而明日香则从他身边走过，几乎没有注意到他，透过树林窥视，因为她看到了一束阳光。起初缓慢跟随她的真嗣，看到了她所见之景，几分钟后，他们突然闯入了一片相当开阔的空地。

The clearing was circular, and large enough that Shinji could just barely see the trees on the other side. The grass was long, but here and there were spots that were flattened out, suggesting that an animal frequently came this way and rolled around in the grass. Taking several steps further into the clearing, Asuka suddenly lay down, flattening a large patch of grass. She was grinning slightly, and patted to the side next to her, suggesting that Shinji do they same.

这片空地呈圆形，大到真嗣勉强能看到对面的树木。草很长，但这里那里有些地方被压平了，表明有动物经常来这里在草地上打滚。明日香又向前走了几步，突然躺下，压平了一大片草地。她微微一笑，拍了拍旁边的位置，示意真嗣也这样做。

"I'd rather not," said Shinji. "You know that you'll get all itchy that way Asuka."

“我还是算了，”真嗣说，“你知道那样你会痒得难受的，明日香。”

She didn't seem to care, because she grabbed Shinji's hand, and pulled him down on top of her. As the sun came out from behind the clouds, Shinji saw Asuka's face bathed in sunlight, and even he couldn't help but grin.

她似乎并不在意，因为她抓住了真嗣的手，将他拉倒在她的身上。当太阳从云层后露出时，真嗣看到明日香的脸沐浴在阳光下，连他也不禁露出了笑容。

"This place is nice," said Asuka, their face mere inches apart.

“这个地方真不错，”明日香说道，他们的脸相距不过几英寸。

"Yeah," mumbled Shinji. “嗯，”真嗣咕哝道。

"So...are you going to continue crushing me like this?"

“那么……你打算继续这样压着我吗？”

Though she said this, Asuka didn't seem to care one way or another if he got off her, and Shinji suddenly wanted to kiss her, if nothing more than to wipe the smirk of her face. Instead he rolled off her, and sat directly next to her. Asuka let out a low sigh as though she had been expecting something, but she also had to remind herself that this was Shinji she was talking to.

虽然她这么说，但明日香似乎并不在意他是否从她身上下来，真嗣突然想吻她，哪怕只是为了抹去她脸上的得意笑容。相反，他滚到一边，直接坐在她旁边。明日香发出一声低沉的叹息，仿佛她一直在期待什么，但她也不得不提醒自己，她面对的是真嗣。

Still, as Asuka sat up and looked around this area, she realized that though the tall grass made for a good cushion, it blocked most of the scenery of the area. She imagined that this place used to be well kept at one point, but since a little more than six months passed since Third Impact, it wasn't surprising that this place had grown out of control. But she did suddenly have an idea.

然而，当明日香坐起身环顾四周时，她意识到尽管高高的草丛提供了舒适的垫子，却也遮挡了大部分的景色。她想象这个地方曾经一定被精心打理过，但自从第三次冲击发生已过去六个多月，这里变得杂草丛生也不足为奇。不过，她突然有了一个主意。

"Hey Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Whats up?" "怎么了？"

"Any chance you could fulfill a selfish request of mine?"

“能满足我一个自私的请求吗？”

"...Maybe," said Shinji slowly, wondering what on earth Asuka wanted him to do.

“……或许吧，”真嗣缓缓说道，心中疑惑着明日香究竟要他做什么。

"I can understand if you don't want to do it...but, could you flatten the grass in this entire area with your AT-field...or is that too much to ask?"

“如果你不想做，我能理解……但是，你能用你的 AT 力场把这片区域的草都压平吗……还是说这要求太过分了？”

Shinji hadn't expected this request for her, and she was right in that it was selfish, but Shinji suddenly burst out laughing at her words.

真嗣没想到她会提出这样的请求，确实很自私，但真嗣听到她的话后突然忍不住笑了起来。

"Why are you laughing!?" said Asuka, feeling embarrassed. "I know its a dumb question, but the tall grass is ruining the view. Sorry if I said too much but..."

“你笑什么！？”明日香感到有些尴尬，“我知道这个问题很蠢，但这些高草破坏了风景。如果我说得太多了，对不起……”

Asuka let her words trail off, feeling glum and rather dejected, looking down at her knees.

明日香让自己的话语渐渐消失，感到忧郁且相当沮丧，低头看着自己的膝盖。

"Haha, sorry that I was laughing," said Shinji gaining control of himself. "Its just not something I would have expected."

“哈哈，抱歉我刚才笑了，”真嗣控制住自己说道，“只是这真的不是我会预料到的事情。”

"...So you wont do it?" mumbled Asuka.

“……所以你不打算做吗？”明日香咕哝道。

"Well, I didn't say that, and I kinda like the idea anyway. Somehow makes me feel that for whatever reason I have this ability, I'm not using it as it was intended for, which is fine by me. Besides, I've wondered if my range has changed at all."

"嗯，我没那么说，而且我有点喜欢这个想法。不知怎么的，这让我觉得，无论出于什么原因我拥有这种能力，我并没有按照它应有的方式使用它，这对我来说挺好的。此外，我也想知道我的范围是否有所改变。"

"So you will?" "那你愿意吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Throwing her arms up into the air, Asuka turned towards him and brought him into as strong a hug that her small body could muster. Still, Shinji wasn't exactly well built, and felt his bones groaning.

明日香举起双臂，转身面向他，用她娇小的身体所能施展的最大力气紧紧拥抱他。尽管如此，真嗣并不健壮，他感到自己的骨头在呻吟。

"Asuka, you're killing me."

"明日香，你真是要了我的命。"

She simply grinned as she drew away from him, and Shinji momentarily thought she was going to kiss him, when instead she stood up.

她只是咧嘴一笑，从他身边退开，真嗣一时以为她要吻他，结果她却站了起来。

"Whenever you're ready," said Asuka, still smiling.

"随时恭候，"明日香依然微笑着说。

"Yeah, yeah, and stand a good ways away from me. Though I've said it before-"

"是啊，是啊，离我远点儿。不过我之前也说过——"

"You don't want anything happening to me, I know," Asuka said, finishing his sentence.

"你不想让我出什么事，我知道，" 明日香接过他的话。"

"It's been a while though since you've been this close to me when I used it..."

"不过你上次用这东西时离我这么近，已经是很久以前的事了……"

"Like I've said a hundred times before, I trust you Shinji."

“就像我之前说过无数次的那样，我相信你，真嗣。”

"...Right," mumbled Shinji.

"...好吧," 真嗣咕哝道。

With Asuka a good distance behind, Shinji examined the field. If he was honest with himself, he really didn't think he could do this in one go. Creating a dome was a similar application to what he was about to do, but that was a much smaller, condensed form. Of course he didn't want to cut the grass completely down against the soil, so first he had to decide where he wanted the level to be essentially.

阿斯兰娜远远地跟在后面，真嗣仔细观察着场地。如果他对自己诚实的话，他真的不认为他能一次完成这件事。创造一个穹顶与即将要做的事情类似，但那是更小、更集中的形式。当然，他不想把草完全割到土壤里，所以他首先得决定想要草坪的高度大致在哪里。

Next came the precision. While removing cars from the freeways and highways, Shinji was careful to the utmost, but there was nothing precise about smashing his AT-field into a hunk of metal. Rather, it was short of brute force. A blade of grass was a very small and narrow thing, smaller than his thumbnail. Cutting something like that, and thousands of them at once, would be much more difficult than just throwing his AT-field against an object.

接下来是精确度。在清除高速公路上的汽车时，真嗣小心翼翼到了极点，但用 AT 力场猛击一块金属并不需要精确，更多的是蛮力。一根草叶非常细小，比他的拇指指甲还要小。同时切割成千上万根这样的草，比简单地用 AT 力场撞击物体要困难得多。

Gathering himself, a gust of wind came down into the clearly where they stood, blowing both his hair, and Asuka's hair around. With the swaying of the grass, it almost looked like ripples on the ocean. As the wind subsided, Shinji swung his arm outward, projecting his AT-field.

他深吸一口气，一阵疾风从天而降，吹拂着他和明日香的发丝。随着草丛的摇曳，仿佛海面上的波纹。风势渐弱，真嗣挥臂一展，释放出自己的 AT 力场。

From Shinji as the focal point, the flash of orange exploded outward, covering the field in an eerie orange flash momentarily. Flowers that were outside his field of vision sprung up in the air, being directed by the wind and flew off into the air. The grass was immediately severed falling to the ground, and though he heard words from Asuka, he glanced down at his right hand.

从真嗣为中心，橙色的光芒猛然爆发，瞬间将整个场地笼罩在诡异的橙光之中。他视野之外的花朵被风卷起，飘向空中。草地立刻被切断，纷纷坠落，尽管他听到了明日香的声音，他的目光还是不由自主地落在了自己的右手上。

Though he had long grown accustomed to his AT-field, and was able to use it well enough, there was still plenty that he felt he could improve upon. It wasn't something that he enjoyed, but he had become more willing to use it, especially since he felt that using it in these menial matters somehow deprived whatever the reason he had acquired this power. There were still plenty of applications he felt could be applied to his AT-field, and while he didn't feel there was much point in experimenting with them, he still felt like he should. He couldn't say he was thrilled with this ability, but if it helped protect Asuka, then it was fine.

尽管他早已习惯了 AT 力场，并能熟练运用，但他仍觉得有许多可以改进的地方。虽然他并不喜欢使用它，但自从他觉得在这些琐事上使用它似乎削弱了他获得这种力量的初衷后，他变得更加愿意使用它了。他仍觉得 AT 力场有许多应用可以探索，尽管他并不觉得实验这些有什么意义，但他仍觉得应该尝试。他不能说自己对这种能力感到兴奋，但如果它能帮助保护明日香，那就足够了。

"Oi! Are you listening to me!"

“喂！你在听我说话吗！”

Not realizing that Asuka had been trying to talk to him this entire time, Shinji looked up and saw that she was directly in front of him, and that she was tapping his cheek lightly with the palm of her hand.

没有意识到明日香一直在试图和他说话，真嗣抬起头，看到她正站在他面前，用掌心轻轻拍着他的脸颊。

"Damn it say something idiot!"

"该死的，说点什么啊，笨蛋！"

"Sorry, was thinking about something. What did you say?"

"抱歉，刚才在想事情。你刚才说什么？"

Asuka frowned at him and said, "You missed a spot."

明日香皱着眉头对他说：“你漏了一块。”

Shinji glanced over his shoulder and saw that she was right. The far edge of the field had not been flattened, and the grass still stood.

真嗣回头一瞥，发现她说的没错。田地的远端并未被夷平，草丛依旧挺立。

'Looks like this is my current range,' thought Shinji.

“看来这就是我目前的范围了。” 真嗣心想。

"Well, that was still pretty surprising," said Asuka.

"嗯，那还是挺让人惊讶的，" 明日香说道。

"I'm going to assume that you don't want me to fix that," said Shinji gesturing towards the one spot he missed.

"我猜你不想让我修补那个地方吧，" 真嗣说着，指向他遗漏的一处。

"I'm not that mean," said Asuka as she stuck her tongue out at him. Very slowly though, she approached him and hugged him tightly, pressing her body against his.

"我没那么狠心，" 明日香说着，朝他吐了吐舌头。不过，她缓缓地靠近他，紧紧地拥抱他，将身体紧贴在他身上。

"Thanks for this Shinji."

"谢谢你，真嗣。"

"...Don't mention it," mumbled Shinji, aware of all of Asuka's curves against his body.

""...不用谢，"" 真嗣咕哝着，感受到明日香身体的曲线紧贴着自己。

Afterwards, they remained there a short while, and started walking back. As Shinji walked, he briefly thought about making the return walk easier by carving a path through the brush with his AT-field, but he knew that he'd have more to do later, which he couldn't very well ignore.

之后，他们在那里停留了一会儿，然后开始往回走。真嗣边走边短暂地考虑过用 AT 力场在灌木丛中开辟一条路，让回程更轻松些，但他知道稍后还有更多事情要做，不能置之不理。

When they returned, Asuka suggested that they take a short rest, and then go into town for groceries. While Shinji would have liked to accompany her, he decided to collect the firewood while she was gone, and after telling her this, Asuka simply frowned and said, "And how do you plan or bringing it here? You're not going to cut any trees down around our house." Shinji simply told her that he had an idea, and left it at that. Asuka seemed skeptical, but didn't mention it again, only telling him to be careful when she left for town, driving the station wagon.

当他们回来时，明日香提议他们先短暂休息，然后进城采购杂货。虽然真嗣本想陪她一起去，但他决定趁她不在时收集柴火。告诉她这个决定后，明日香只是皱了皱眉说：“那你打算怎么把柴火搬回来？你不会打算砍我们房子周围的树吧。”真嗣简单地告诉她他有个主意，便不再多说。明日香似乎有些怀疑，但没再提这事，只是在她开车去镇上时叮嘱他要小心。

After she left, Shinji gathered up his backpack and stored a couple things inside and left the house, walking towards the house where he had spotted the white truck earlier in the day. The front door was locked, and though he kicked it several times it didn't budge. Thinking that he may try a window, he walked around the house but all of them were closed firmly. Eventually, he decided to just bisect the door with his AT-field, being careful to not project his AT-field farther than the door.

她离开后，真嗣收拾好背包，放了几样东西进去，便离开了房子，朝白天看到白色卡车的地方走去。前门是锁着的，尽管他踢了几次，门却纹丝不动。想到或许可以试试窗户，他绕着房子走了一圈，但所有的窗户都关得严严实实。最终，他决定用 AT 力场直接切开大门，小心翼翼地不让 AT 力场延伸超过门的范围。

Stepping over the remains of the broken door, he looked up at the vaulted ceiling in the house. The living room was to his left, complete with couch, bookshelf, and T.V. Shinji was glad they hadn't looked at this house before, as it didn't seem to have a fireplace. The floor was wood tiled on the first floor, and the second floor was carpeted white, and all the walls were white as well.

跨过破碎的门板残骸，他抬头望向屋内的拱形天花板。客厅在他的左侧，配备有沙发、书架和电视。真嗣庆幸他们之前没来看过这栋房子，因为它似乎没有壁炉。一楼铺着木地板，二楼则是白色的地毯，所有墙壁也都是白色的。

Walking into the kitchen to the right of the front door, he began opening drawers until he found a drawer with many sets of keys inside it. Grabbing all of them, he left the house, and tried the trucks door, expecting it to be locked. It opened easily, and he climbed into the driver seat, trying all the different keys. He was glad to see it was an automatic, so it wouldn't be difficult to drive at least. Shinji still didn't think he'd ever drive the station wagon, and Asuka seemed content with it that way, but he supposed he'd need to learn to drive eventually.

走进正门右侧的厨房，他开始逐一打开抽屉，直到找到一个装有许多套钥匙的抽屉。他抓起所有钥匙，离开了房子，试着打开卡车的门，预料它会锁着。门轻易地开了，他爬进驾驶座，尝试着用不同的钥匙。看到它是自动挡的，他松了口气，至少开起来不会太难。真嗣仍然不认为自己会开那辆旅行车，而明日香似乎对此也感到满意，但他想自己终究还是需要学会开车的。

Finding the right key, he turned it, and the engine spluttered multiple times before the truck finally started. Putting it in drive, Shinji carefully turned the wheel and tapped the gas pedal. It had far more power then he had at first expect, and he jolted forward suddenly.

找到正确的钥匙，他转动它，引擎噼啪作响了几次后，卡车终于启动了。挂上档，真嗣小心翼翼地转动方向盘，轻踩油门。车子比他最初预想的要有力得多，他猛地向前冲去。

'This may take some time to get used to,' he thought.

“这可能需要一些时间来适应，”他心想。

Carefully driving down the road, he passed their house, and turned left, driving up the steep hill to the top. At the top of the hill, he decided to take a right, driving further into the dense forest. Taking a left would mean driving towards town, and Shinji didn't want start cutting trees down that way if he could help it.

他小心翼翼地沿着道路行驶，经过他们的房子，然后向左转，驱车上坡至顶。到达山顶后，他决定向右转，深入茂密的森林。向左意味着驶向城镇，如果可以避免，真嗣并不想从那边开始砍树。

The truck had plenty of gas in it, so Shinji didn't need to worry about that, but he was still very careful whenever he turned a corner. Asuka would have likely already complained twice about his driving, but Shinji rather enjoyed this slow pace. He had the window rolled down on his side and was humming softly to himself.

卡车的油量充足，所以真嗣不必为此担心，但每次转弯时他仍然非常谨慎。明日香可能已经抱怨过两次他的驾驶了，但真嗣其实挺享受这种慢节奏。他这边的车窗摇了下来，自己轻声哼着曲子。

After driving for a good while, and with no end in sight of the road still, Shinji found as likely a spot as any to get out. Pulling off onto a gravel shoulder, he stepped out of the truck, and looked at the trees on either side of the road. The Japanese always prided themselves in the beauty which their country held, and were overly self conscious about affecting the environment, since Japan was an island afterall. Their gardens were among the most beautiful in the world, and even this simple area surrounded by rows and rows of trees, Shinji had to pause and marvel at them for a while. Still, it wasn't possible for them to live without a fuel source, both for cooking and warmth, so cutting these down were the only option.

在驾车行驶了许久，道路依旧望不到尽头后，真嗣找到了一个看似合适的地方停下来。他将卡车驶离路面，停在碎石路肩上，走下车，环顾道路两旁的树木。日本人总是自豪于自己国家所拥有的美景，并且对影响环境一事格外敏感，毕竟日本是个岛国。他们的园林是世界最美之一，即便是这片被成排树木环绕的简单区域，真嗣也不禁驻足赞叹一番。然而，他们无法脱离燃料来源而生活，无论是烹饪还是取暖，因此砍伐这些树木成了唯一的选择。

The road cut its way through a hillside, and though on the left, the hills sloped upwards, to the right where Shinji was looking, it gently sloped downwards. Thinking further into the future for what may come later, Shinji decided that it would be better to create a sort of logging trail for an easier access point. He couldn't just keep cutting trees down on the side of the road indefinitely after all, and the further away the truck was, meant the more difficult it would be to haul the lumber back.

道路蜿蜒穿过山坡，尽管左侧山丘逐渐上升，但在右侧，也就是真嗣所望之处，地势却缓缓下降。考虑到未来可能面临的挑战，真嗣认为最好开辟一条伐木小径，以便更便捷地进出。毕竟，他不能无限制地在道路旁砍伐树木，而且卡车离得越远，拖运木材的难度就越大。

Choosing a certain spot in a gap of the tree line, Shinji began working slowly against the forest. The forest lacked the intense brush like the place behind their house did, and was largely flat after going down the gentle slope. Carving a path out with his AT-field, Shinji alternated between driving his truck forward, and cutting down trees when he couldn't simply drive around them. The trees themselves were large enough within their own right, and multiple times he had to project his AT-field around himself and the truck to prevent the truck from being crushed, but all in all, it wasn't difficult.

在树线的一处间隙中选定了一个位置，真嗣开始在森林中缓慢推进。这片森林不像他们家后院那样有密集的灌木，而且在经过一个缓坡后，大部分地区都是平坦的。他利用 AT 力场开辟出一条道路，交替着驾驶卡车前进和砍伐树木，当无法绕过时。这些树木本身就相当高大，多次他不得不在自己和卡车周围展开 AT 力场以防卡车被压坏，但总的来说，这并不困难。

After cutting down plenty of trees, and splitting the larger chunks into firewood, Shinji stopped the truck in a small clearing. As he examined the area, he decided that this was a good place to branch out from, both north, west, and east. He was far enough from the road that when he looked back towards where he came, he couldn't see any sign of it. The truck was already half full of firewood at this point, but Shinji decided to expand the clearing further, though this wasn't his only reason either.

在砍伐了大量树木并将较大的木块劈成柴火后，真嗣将卡车停在一个小空地上。他审视着这片区域，认为这是一个向北、西、东三个方向扩展的好起点。他离道路足够远，以至于回头望去，看不到任何道路的痕迹。此时卡车上已经装了一半的柴火，但真嗣决定进一步扩大这片空地，尽管这并非他唯一的理由。

Leaning against the truck, he slowly sipped water from the bottle he had stored in his backpack, thinking about what he could do to improve his AT-field. Power wasn't a problem, and in all likely hood, as Shinji matured and grew in his ability, this would only increase. So far, he could use the dome, the basic wall, and simply projecting it outward, destroying everything in its path. In the past, back in Tokyo-2, he had tried a myriad of other things, none of which had been successful. Misshapen shapes came to his mind, and objects that were similar to actual weapons, but these all seemed silly.

倚靠在卡车旁，他缓缓从背包里存放的瓶中啜饮着水，思索着如何提升自己的 AT 力场。力量并非问题，随着真嗣的成长与能力的增强，这只会不断增长。迄今为止，他能运用穹顶、基础壁垒以及简单地向外投射，摧毁沿途一切。过去在东京-2 时，他曾尝试过无数其他方法，却无一成功。脑海中浮现出各种奇形怪状的形态，以及类似真实武器的物体，但这些都显得荒谬可笑。

It wasn't just the application of the AT-field though, but also Shinji's precision in using it, as well as his reaction time. Precision was one thing which he felt could very easily be improved upon, but Shinji's own reaction time was a different matter. As it stood, projecting his AT-field outward often had the feeling of throwing a baseball at supersonic speeds, but there was still the problem of 'throwing.' First Shinji had to recognize the situation in which he needed to use his AT-field, and then react to that situation, projecting his AT-field outward. Recognizing took one second, and then the reacting took another. Two seconds in which an innumerable amount of things could go wrong. Shinji wanted to reach the state where the two seconds didn't exist.

不仅仅是 AT 力场的应用，还有真嗣在使用它时的精准度以及他的反应速度。精准度是他觉得很容易提升的方面，但真嗣自身的反应时间则是另一回事。目前，向外投射 AT 力场的感觉就像以超音速投掷棒球，但问题依然在于“投掷”本身。首先，真嗣需要识别出需要使用 AT 力场的情境，然后对这一情境做出反应，向外投射 AT 力场。识别需要一秒，反应又耗一秒。这两秒钟内，无数变数可能发生。真嗣渴望达到那种无需这两秒的境界。

Ultimately, the 'throwing' was the main problem. The concept of what an AT-field was, was still difficult for Shinji to understand. It was a part of his being, who he was, but he had long negated that part and ignored it for the most part. In theory, it was always with him, just waiting to be used. When he did use it, his own arm acted as something of an extension, directing his AT-field to wherever he needed it. This was the 'throwing' part, which troubled Shinji. Instead of suppressing his AT-field, and only calling upon it when needed, by unconsciously being able to use it at all times, he'd be able to eliminate those two seconds.

最终，问题出在‘投掷’上。AT 力场的概念对真嗣来说依然难以理解。它是他存在的一部分，是他自身的一部分，但他长期以来一直否定并忽视了这一部分。理论上，它始终伴随着他，只待被使用。当他使用它时，他的手臂就像是 AT 力场的延伸，引导它到达他需要的地方。这就是‘投掷’的部分，这让真嗣感到困扰。如果他不是抑制 AT 力场，只在需要时才召唤它，而是无意识地随时都能使用它，他就能消除那两秒钟的延迟。

That being said, putting it into practical use would be far more difficult than Shinji even knew. But before he even considered working on that, there were other things he could focus on.

话虽如此，将其付诸实践将比真嗣所知的还要困难得多。但在他考虑着手解决这个问题之前，还有其他事情可以关注。

Putting his water back into the truck, he started cutting down the rest of the trees, experimenting as he did so. For a while now, he'd wondered if the AT-field was a single entity, or if it could multiplied, split in two, so to speak. Try as he might though, he couldn't split his AT-field into two separate halves, and wondered if it was possible at all, or if he was still not use to it enough. He hadn't used it this heavily since his initial discovery and training in December. Even the cars on the highways had been boring tedious work for the most part, but he was actually taking the time to think of these new things.

将水放回卡车后，他开始砍伐剩下的树木，边做边试验。一直以来，他都在思考 AT 力场究竟是一个整体，还是能够被复制、一分为二。尽管他竭尽全力，却始终无法将 AT 力场分成两个独立的部分，不禁怀疑这是否可能，或者自己是否还未完全适应。自去年十二月初次发现并训练以来，他未曾如此频繁地使用过 AT 力场。就连高速公路上的车辆，大部分时间也不过是乏味单调的工作，但此刻他却真正花时间思考这些新问题。

Besides this though, the other thing he always wondered, 'was the AT-field merely energy, or did it have a certain solid substance to it?' Either could create destruction of course, but knowing that the AT-field was solid could prove useful.

除了这一点，他一直好奇的另一件事是，'AT 力场究竟只是能量，还是具有某种固态物质？'当然，无论是哪种都能造成破坏，但知道 AT 力场是固态的可能会很有用。

Pausing while in the middle of cutting down trees within the clearing, Shinji projected his AT-field in front of him, creating a platform, which was really just the wall turned on its side. Raising his foot upright, he almost expected it to be shorn clean off, but he surprisingly felt it make contact with the flashy orange surface. It was much how he imagined standing on water might feel. Placing his other foot on his AT-field, he stood upright on it bouncing up and down slightly, testing the weight. It didn't seem to break as long as he kept it projected, though he could see this quickly draining him if kept like this. Still...

在林中空地砍树时停顿了一下，真嗣在他面前投射出 AT 力场，创造出一个平台，其实就是将墙壁侧放。他抬起脚，几乎以为会被切断，但出乎意料地感觉到脚与闪亮的橙色表面接触。这感觉很像他想象中站在水上的感觉。他将另一只脚也放在 AT 力场上，直立起来，轻轻上下弹跳，测试重量。只要他持续投射，它似乎就不会破裂，尽管他可以看出如果一直这样会很快耗尽他的能量。不过……

Glancing up at the treetops above him, he wondered if something like that would be possible. Pondering about this for several seconds, he decided on his course of action, and jumped as high as his legs would allow him. Maybe because of his AT-field, or because of his heightened physical abilities, he soared far further than he had anticipated. Scrambling to create another platform, he misjudged the projection, and instead of landing safely on another platform, he fell back to the ground after rising almost two stories. Predictably, his legs snapped from under him. Pain wasn't anything new to him, but his scream still leaked out in the clearing, echoing in the silence around him.

抬头望向头顶的树梢，他不禁思索起这种可能性。沉吟片刻后，他决定采取行动，竭尽全力一跃而起。或许是 AT 力场的作用，又或是身体能力的提升，他飞跃的距离远超预期。慌忙试图再造一个平台，却判断失误，未能安全着陆于新平台，而是在攀升近两层楼高后坠回地面。不出所料，双腿应声折断。疼痛对他而言并不陌生，但尖叫声依旧在空旷中泄出，回荡在四周的寂静里。

From his laying position on the ground, he propped himself on his elbows, and glanced down at his legs. The ground was softer than pavement or concrete, but this wasn't able to stop the bone sticking out of his ankle at an odd angle. Letting himself fall back to the ground, he swore briefly, wishing he hadn't fucked up so badly. It wasn't like it would take long to heal, but the fact that he had screwed up over something that seemed rather simple made him angry.

他从躺在地上的姿势撑起自己，双肘支地，低头看向双腿。地面比柏油路或混凝土要柔软，但这并未能阻止他脚踝处骨头以怪异的角度突出。他让自己再次倒回地面，简短地咒骂了一句，后悔自己搞砸得如此严重。虽然愈合不会花太长时间，但因如此看似简单的事情而搞砸，令他感到愤怒。

It just proved how much he still had to learn with regards to his AT-field.

这恰恰证明了他对于 AT 力场还有多少需要学习的地方。

While Shinji was doing all of this, Asuka had already entered the town, gone to the grocery store, and was on her way back. She had stocked up all sorts of things from canned goods, to salt, spices, and water. She had been a bit worried about the smell inside the store, but nearly everything within the produce and meat department had long degraded, so it wasn't that bad. There was still plenty of supplies left before they'd even have to consider finding a new store, so they didn't have to worry about that.

当真嗣在做这些的时候，明日香已经进城了，去了杂货店，正在回来的路上。她囤积了各种东西，从罐头食品到盐、香料和水。她对店内的气味有些担心，但农产品和肉类部门的几乎所有东西都早已变质，所以情况并不算太糟。在他们考虑寻找新商店之前，还有大量的物资剩余，所以他们不必为此担心。

Asuka didn't spend much time driving around the small town, but after finishing her business at the store, had driven almost straight home. She was beginning to get back into the motions of life such as they had had in Tokyo-2, and was even considering to offer to cook dinner tonight.

明日香并没有在小城里开车闲逛太久，但在商店办完事后，几乎直接开车回家了。她开始重新适应像他们在东京-2 时那样的生活节奏，甚至考虑今晚主动提出做饭。

While driving along the road passed the many rows of trees though, Asuka's thoughts turned towards Shinji. Reflecting back on the goodnight kiss she gave him last night, Asuka didn't feel nearly as embarrassed now as she had then; it even felt somewhat normal. She felt like her relationship with Shinji was a constantly changing and evolving thing as they both continued exploring the boundaries. Well, somethings were still very well outside the realm of possibility.

当沿着路穿过一排排树木时，明日香的心思转向了真嗣。回想起昨晚她给他的晚安吻，明日香现在并不像当时那样感到尴尬；甚至觉得有些平常。她觉得她和真嗣的关系就像是一个不断变化和发展的过程，他们都在继续探索彼此的界限。嗯，有些事情仍然远远超出了可能的范围。

'I wonder how much longer this will continue though?' wondered Asuka. They were playing a back and forth game it felt, almost attempting to one up the other each time. Its was kinda childish, but Asuka didn't mind it.

“不过，我想知道这种情况还会持续多久？”明日香心想。他们似乎在玩一场来回拉锯的游戏，每次都试图超越对方。虽然有点孩子气，但明日香并不介意。

Taking a right on their road, Asuka let the car coast down the hill before pulling into their driveway. Gathering up her backpack first, and then several plastic bags filled with food, Asuka walked around the patio and opened the sliding glass door.

在路口右转后，明日香让车顺着斜坡滑行，然后驶入车道。她先拿起背包，然后是装满食物的几个塑料袋，绕过露台，打开了滑动玻璃门。

"Shinji, you here?" "真嗣，你在这里吗？"

She waited several seconds before assuming he wasn't, and then started storing everything in the kitchen. He'd said he would take care of the firewood today, so he was probably still doing that. Shrugging it off, Asuka went into the study, found herself a likely book, and then walked upstairs to the bedroom. Sliding under the covers, she started reading, but now that she was back at home, found it more difficult to concentrate knowing that Shinji wasn't here. This had often happened to her when Shinji would take his late night walks in Tokyo-2, but it felt more pronounced now. It was a testament to how far her feelings had come since then.

她等了几秒，见他没有回应，便开始收拾厨房。他曾说过今天会负责柴火，大概还在忙那件事吧。阿斯卡不以为意，走进书房，挑了一本可能感兴趣的书，然后上楼回到卧室。她钻进被窝，开始阅读，但回到家中，发现少了真嗣在身边，集中精神变得愈发困难。每当真嗣在第二新东京进行深夜散步时，这种情况也常发生，但此刻感觉尤为明显。这证明了自那时起，她的感情已经走得有多远。

While waiting for him, she began dozing lightly while under the warm covers, and woke up with a start when she heard the honk of some unknown car outside the bedroom window. Rolling out of bed, she glanced out the window and saw a white truck parked next to their station wagon, with Shinji stepping out of the driver seat. The back was filled to the top with splintered firewood.

在等他的间隙，她蜷缩在温暖的被窝里轻浅地打起了盹，直到窗外不知名车辆的喇叭声将她猛然惊醒。她从床上滚下来，瞥向窗外，只见一辆白色卡车停在他们的小货车旁，真嗣正从驾驶座上下来。卡车的后部堆满了劈好的木柴，几乎顶到了车顶。

Walking down stairs, Asuka opened the side door to the garage just as Shinji opened the large door manually from the outside.

走下楼梯，明日香正好在真嗣从外面手动打开大门时，推开了车库的侧门。

"Been back long?" asked Shinji when he saw her.

“回来很久了吗？”真嗣看到她时问道。

"An hour maybe. I fell asleep while waiting for you. Is this the same truck that we saw earlier while walking around the neighborhood?"

“大概一小时吧。我等你的时候睡着了。这是我们之前在社区散步时看到的那辆卡车吗？”

"Yeah. I figured it would be better to have something larger to gather firewood, plus you aren't the only one that can drive now."

"是啊。我想有个大点的车来收集柴火会更好，而且你现在也不是唯一会开车的人了。"

"But you still can't drive the station wagon," Asuka reminded him.

"但你还是开不了旅行车，"明日香提醒他。"

"True," shrugged Shinji as he started towards the truck to unload the firewood.

"确实，" 真嗣耸耸肩，朝卡车走去准备卸下柴火。"

"Need any help?" asked Asuka.

"需要帮忙吗？" 明日香问道。

"Nah, I got it. Besides, most of these trees were covered in sap, so I don't suppose you'd want to get your hands and clothes sticky."

"不用了，我自己能行。再说，这些树大多都沾满了树脂，我想你也不想弄得手和衣服都黏糊糊的吧。"

"I don't mind," said Asuka as she rolled her sleeves up to help him.

"我不介意，" 明日香说着卷起袖子准备帮他。

With two people, it went far quicker, and after changing and washing their hands, they sat in front of the fireplace with the new firewood roaring in the grate.

两个人一起，事情进展得快多了，换好衣服洗完手后，他们坐在壁炉前，新添的木柴在炉栅中熊熊燃烧。

"How was the grocery store?" asked Shinji.

“杂货店怎么样？”真嗣问道。

"Fine. I got plenty of food and more water. The place should last us for a while I think. Though I want to know where you went for all that firewood. It looks as though you cut down about thirty trees."

“挺好的。我买了不少食物和水，这个地方应该能支撑我们一段时间。不过我想知道你那些木柴是从哪儿弄来的，看起来你好像砍了三十棵树。”

'You aren't far off,' thought Shinji. Clearing his throat, he said, "I decided to create my own path into the forest farther up the road, and then found a clearing which I guess is gonna be the main place I get the firewood from now on."

'你猜得八九不离十，' 真嗣心想。他清了清嗓子，说道："我决定在路更远的地方开辟一条通往森林的小径，然后发现了一片空地，我想以后主要就是从那里获取柴火了。"

"Any problems?" "有什么问题吗？"

"Nope," said Shinji hoping that his face didn't reveal anything, but Asuka seemed to believe him.

"没有，" 真嗣说道，希望自己的表情没有透露任何信息，但明日香似乎相信了他。

"Thats good," said Asuka with a sigh.

"那就好，" 明日香叹了口气说道。

Leaning against Shinji, she caught a mixture of sap and pine leaves mixed in with his scent. It was pleasant to say the least.

她倚靠在真嗣身上，闻到了混合着树液和松叶的气息，与他的体香交织在一起。至少可以说，这感觉相当宜人。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Its a bit warm for this right now."

“现在穿这个有点热了。”

"Well, we can go upstairs where its colder if you want to."

"好吧，如果你想的话，我们可以去楼上，那里更冷。"

Whether she had intend it or not, the tone in Asuka's voice almost seemed like she was trying to seduce Shinji.

无论她是否有意，明日香的声音听起来几乎像是在试图诱惑真嗣。

"No, if I get under the covers, I'm probably gonna fall asleep," said Shinji, hoping that his voice didn't sound strained.

"不，如果我钻进被窝，很可能会睡着，" 真嗣说道，希望自己的声音听起来不那么紧张。

"Then stay like this," grumbled Asuka.

“那就保持这样，”明日香嘟囔着。

"Fine," said Shinji, giving into her demand.

“好吧，”真嗣顺从了她的要求。

Shortly later though, while sitting in silence, Shinji's head dropped to the side, and he fell asleep. When Asuka saw this, she tutted softly in annoyance. She wasn't sure if Shinji had over exerted himself, but she was annoyed that he had fallen asleep with hardly a mention. Now she did wish that they were upstairs instead of here.

不久后，当两人静坐时，真嗣的头偏向一侧，不知不觉间睡着了。明日香见状，不满地轻啧了一声。她不确定真嗣是否过于疲惫，但他的突然入睡让她感到恼火，毕竟他几乎没怎么提及就睡着了。此刻，她真希望他们能在楼上而非这里。

Glancing over at his sleeping face, she felt a wide variety of emotions assault her. She knew what they were by now, but that didn't make them any easier to act on. Shinji was sleeping now though, so right now would be the perfect time to...

瞥了一眼他熟睡的脸庞，她感到各种情绪如潮水般涌来。她现在知道这些情绪是什么，但这并没有让它们变得更容易应对。不过，真嗣现在正在睡觉，所以此刻正是……

Asuka bit her lips and shook her head. What was she thinking? Shinji was sleeping right now, so that would mean Asuka was taking advantage of the situation. But still, the opportunity was practically presenting itself to her.

明日香咬着嘴唇，摇了摇头。她在想什么？真嗣现在正在睡觉，这意味着明日香是在趁人之危。但即便如此，这个机会几乎是在主动向她招手。

Biting her lips again, she glanced around, almost expecting somebody to be watching her, but this was a stupid thought. Looking back at Shinji's face, her eyes were drawn to his lips, slightly parted.

她再次咬住嘴唇，环顾四周，几乎以为有人在监视她，但这个想法很愚蠢。目光回到真嗣的脸上，她的视线不由自主地被他微微张开的嘴唇吸引。

'Am I really going to,' wondered Asuka, but even as she thought this, her face drew closer to him. It wasn't something difficult like when she had to learn to drive a stick shift, just a quick skin to skin contact. Nothing more than exchanging pleasantries with people in certain countries. Asuka couldn't think of it as anything other than a kiss however. Even as she drew nearer to him, she told herself that this wasn't right, that what she was doing was wrong. But reasoning was thrown out the window and replaced by emotions fueled by her hormones. She could feel Shinji's breath on her face now as she drew nearer. Any second now, her lips would make contact with his and then it'd be over. Afterwards, she'd feel horrible about the whole ordeal, but at this moment she didn't care.

'我真的要这么做吗？'明日香思索着，但即便如此，她的脸还是不由自主地向他靠近。这并不像她当初学开手动挡车那样困难，只是短暂的肌肤之亲。不过是在某些国家与人寒暄时的礼节罢了。然而，明日香无法将此视为单纯的亲吻。尽管她越来越接近他，内心却不断告诫自己这是不对的，她正在做的是错误的。但理智已被情感所取代，被荷尔蒙驱动的情绪占据了上风。她能感受到真嗣的呼吸拂过她的脸庞，越来越近。下一秒，她的唇即将触碰到他的，一切便将结束。事后，她定会为这一幕感到无比懊悔，但此刻，她已无暇顾及。

Just as their lips almost touched though, Shinji stirred slightly, and Asuka froze, thinking that he was about to awake. He did no such thing however, but tilted his face to the side briefly. Asuka felt everything draining out of her, as the reasoning part of her brain kicked back into gear. She could very well still follow through with this still, but she felt so disgusted with herself that she instead placed her head gently against his chest. This wasn't how it was supposed to be; it wouldn't matter if they both weren't aware of it.

就在两人的唇瓣几乎要触碰的瞬间，真嗣微微动了动，明日香顿时僵住，以为他要醒来了。然而他并没有醒来，只是短暂地将脸侧向一边。明日香感到所有的冲动都从体内流失，理智的部分重新占据了大脑。她本可以继续下去，但内心涌起的厌恶感让她只是轻轻地将头靠在他的胸前。事情不应该是这样的；如果他们都不知情，那也无所谓。

'I'm starting to lose myself,' thought Asuka bitterly.

'我开始迷失自我了，' 明日香苦涩地想道。

After this, Asuka kept her distance from Shinji for the reminder of his nap, determined to not let her hormones act up again. She was in such turmoil over her actions that she didn't even realize when Shinji woke up. She had retired to the bedroom, trying to keep her thoughts to herself, but when Shinji stepped into the bedroom, she was reminded again of what she had nearly done.

在这之后，明日香决定在真嗣午睡期间与他保持距离，决心不让自己的荷尔蒙再次失控。她对自己的行为感到如此混乱，以至于都没注意到真嗣何时醒来。她躲进了卧室，试图独自消化这些思绪，但当真嗣走进卧室时，她再次想起了自己差点做的事情。

"I was surprised to see that you were up here and not down in the living room when I woke up," started Shinji.

“我醒来时很惊讶你在这里而不是在客厅，”真嗣开口说道。

"Sorry, you were sleeping so peacefully that I didn't want to wake you," lied Asuka.

“抱歉，你睡得那么安稳，我不想吵醒你。”明日香撒谎道。

"I kinda wish you had. I think I slept longer than I should have, its get close to evening now. Did you want to have dinner now, or wait a while longer?"

"我有点希望你叫醒我。我想我睡得比应该的时间长，现在都快傍晚了。你想现在吃晚饭，还是再等一会儿？"

"Whatever works," said Asuka.

"随便都行，" 明日香说道。

Shinji raised an eyebrow, wondering if something had happened that he didn't know about, since Asuka seemed abrasive for some reason, but he didn't say anything.

真嗣挑了挑眉，不知道是不是发生了什么他不知道的事，因为明日香似乎有些不耐烦，但他什么也没说。

"Okay. Well, I'll start dinner in an hour or so."

“好的，那我一个小时左右开始做晚饭。”

"Right," mumbled Asuka. “嗯。”明日香咕哝道。

When Shinji left, Asuka buried herself further under the covers, trying to drown out everything. While she could drown out the sounds of everything around her, she couldn't drown out her own thoughts pounding in her mind. Her entire body was throbbing with a certain feeling that she didn't know how to describe. Quite suddenly though, horror struck as she felt something seeping between her legs. Throwing the covers off herself in one fluid motion she stared down at the sheets and the shorts which she had been wearing.

当真嗣离开后，明日香将自己更深地埋进被子里，试图隔绝一切。虽然她能屏蔽周围所有的声音，却无法阻止自己脑海中翻涌的思绪。她的全身都在悸动，一种她不知如何形容的感觉。然而，突然间，一阵恐惧袭来，她感到有什么东西在双腿间渗出。她迅速掀开被子，低头看着床单和身上穿着的短裤。

'You're kidding me,' thought Asuka, as she stared at the dark red spot staining the white sheets. She understood what had happened, but that didn't make her feel any better about it. She again felt disgusted with herself, but more so because she had been thinking about Shinji throughout it all. There was no way she would let him find out about this; she'd burn the sheets before that.

“你在开玩笑吧，”明日香心想，盯着那片染在白床单上的暗红色污渍。她明白发生了什么，但这丝毫没有让她感觉好受些。她再次对自己感到厌恶，更甚的是，她在这整个过程中一直想着真嗣。她绝不会让他发现这件事；她会在那之前把床单烧掉。

Changing out of both her shorts and underwear, she cleaned herself thoroughly, and then removed the sheets from the bed, bundling them up and throwing them in a far back corner of the closet. She'd dispose of them first chance she got, without letting Shinji know. Thankfully, there was a spare in the closet that she was able to use that didn't look any different from the one she had soiled.

她换掉了短裤和内裤，彻底清洗了自己，随后拆下床单，卷成一团扔到了衣橱最里面的角落。一有机会她就会悄悄处理掉这些床单，不让真嗣知道。幸好衣橱里还有一套备用床单，看起来和她弄脏的那套没什么两样，她便用上了。

With that said and done though, there was the reality of what had happened. Asuka had heard plenty about this from Misato, who had explained everything to the best of her awkward ability. Having it actually happen to her was a different matter however.

话虽如此，但事实已经发生。明日香从美里那里听到了不少关于此事的解释，尽管美里尽力以她笨拙的方式详尽说明。然而，当这一切真的发生在她身上时，感受却是另一番截然不同的体验。

Sitting back on the bed, Asuka sank into a depressed state. Her thoughts regarding Shinji, her uncontrollable hormones, and now this pain. Everything swirled around in her mind until she wanted to scream. She didn't care whether Shinji heard her or not, she just wanted to relieve these pent up feelings. But she didn't, because that would mean answering the questions that came with it.

坐在床边，明日香陷入了抑郁之中。她对真嗣的想法、无法控制的荷尔蒙，还有现在的疼痛。所有这些在她脑海中盘旋，让她想要尖叫。她不在乎真嗣是否听到，她只想释放这些压抑的情绪。但她没有这么做，因为那意味着要回答随之而来的问题。

After about an hour passed, Asuka heard Shinji calling her from downstairs. Dinner was apparently ready, but Asuka was in no mood to eat, or see him for that matter. Sure enough though, she heard Shinji's feet walking along the hallway, and she tried to feign sleep.

大约一个小时过去后，明日香听到真嗣从楼下叫她。晚饭显然已经准备好了，但明日香完全没有心情吃，更不想见他。果然，她听到真嗣的脚步声沿着走廊走来，她试图装睡。

"Asuka, did you hear me?" asked Shinji from the doorway.

“明日香，你听到我说话了吗？”真嗣站在门口问道。

Asuka didn't say anything for several seconds until she finally muttered, "Not hungry."

明日香沉默了几秒，最终低声咕哝道：“不饿。”

Shinji frowned, though Asuka didn't see this. Instead, he walked further into the road and asked, "You aren't sick are you? Maybe you caught something while shopping."

真嗣皱了皱眉，尽管明日香没有看到。他继续沿着路走，问道：“你没生病吧？是不是购物时感染了什么？”

"I'm fine," Asuka said, her voice tense.

“我没事，”明日香说，声音紧绷。

"Whats wrong then?" “那怎么了？”

"Nothing. I'm fine." “没什么。我很好。”

"That clearly isn't the case."

“显然不是这样。”

"Leave me alone Shinji!" “别管我，真嗣！”

Shinji sighed, but instead of leaving, he sat down on the bed beside her. Gently, he rested his hand on the spot where her head was, buried under the covers. But Asuka shook him off none to gently.

真嗣叹了口气，但没有离开，而是坐在她旁边的床上。他轻轻地将手放在她头埋在被子里的位置。但明日香毫不客气地甩开了他的手。

'Somethings clearly wrong, but she doesn't want to tell me,' thought Shinji. He had hoped they had gone beyond this stage, but it looked like whatever was troubling Asuka, was just that problematic.

“显然有什么不对劲，但她不想告诉我，”真嗣心想。他本以为他们已经超越了这个阶段，但看来困扰明日香的事情确实很棘手。

"I'll bring up your dinner then, if you don't want to eat it downstairs."

那我就把你的晚餐端上来吧，如果你不想在楼下吃的话。

Saying this, Shinji left and then brought her up a plate, setting it down on the nightstand beside her. Leaving the bedroom, he shut the door, and only when Asuka was sure that Shinji's feet had descended downstairs, did she sit up, and look at the food. She ate frantically, and then covered herself under the blankets again.

说完这话，真嗣便离开了，随后给她端来一盘食物，放在她床头柜上。他走出卧室，关上门，直到明日香确信真嗣的脚步声已经下楼，她才坐起身，看向食物。她狼吞虎咽地吃了起来，然后又把自己裹回毯子里。

She knew she couldn't keep this up, and it was only a matter of time before Shinji came upstairs again, but until then, she'd have to come up with a reasonable lie. She couldn't tell him the truth.

她知道她不能一直这样下去，真嗣迟早会再次上楼来，但在那之前，她必须想出一个合理的谎言。她不能告诉他真相。

Not yet, at any rate.

至少现在还不能。

Hours passed by, and still Shinji hadn't come back upstairs. Asuka was beginning to worry that she might have pushed him away more than she had intended. She debated with herself whether to leave the sanctuary of her covers, or to remain here for the rest of the night. It couldn't have been later than nine o'clock, so he would almost certainly still be awake.

时间一分一秒地过去，真嗣仍旧没有回到楼上。明日香开始担心自己可能把他推开得比预想的更远。她内心挣扎着是否要离开被窝的庇护，还是就这样待到天亮。时间应该还没到九点，所以他肯定还醒着。

'Unless he decided to sleep in the other room,' a voice in Asuka's mind told her.

'除非他决定睡在另一个房间，'明日香脑海中的声音告诉她。

Somehow, this was even more unpleasant than Asuka had imagined. While Asuka wasn't sure how well she'd react with Shinji beside her for another night, if he had decided to sleep in the guest room because of how she had acted, she wasn't sure if she could forgive herself.

不知为何，这比明日香想象的还要糟糕。虽然她不确定自己能否适应真嗣在身边再过一夜，但如果他因为她的行为而选择睡在客房，她不确定自己是否能原谅自己。

No matter how much Asuka told herself she didn't want to see him however, the truth was that she did, so much that it was a constant ache in her chest. It was like something was building up slowly, and felt like it would burst within her at any moment.

无论明日香如何告诉自己不想见他，事实却是她确实渴望见到他，这种渴望如此强烈，以至于胸口总隐隐作痛。仿佛有什么东西在缓慢积累，随时都可能在她内心爆发。

Shrugging the covers off herself, she stood up and looked out the window beside the bed. The sky was clear, and the moon was out, bathing their house in whitish moonlight.

她抖开身上的被子，站起身来，望向床边窗户外的天空。夜空清澈，月亮高悬，银白色的月光洒满了他们的房子。

Leaving the bedroom, she walked down the hallway, and opened the door to the guest room. They'd hardly stepped into the room since they had moved in yesterday, and it was more or less another place for storage. The bed was clearly unoccupied, and hadn't been touched at all.

她走出卧室，沿着走廊前行，推开了客房的门。自从昨天搬进来后，他们几乎没踏进过这个房间，这里差不多成了另一个储物空间。床铺显然无人使用，完全没有被触碰过的痕迹。

Closing the door, Asuka slowly stepped downstairs, pausing on the landing. She could hear the crackling of the fireplace from the living room, but no sound of Shinji. No shifting of legs, or the turning of a page in the book he was reading.

关上门，明日香缓缓走下楼梯，在楼梯平台上停下脚步。她能听到客厅壁炉中木柴的噼啪声，却听不见真嗣的任何动静。没有挪动双腿的声音，也没有他正在阅读的书页翻动的声响。

Hurrying the rest of the way down the stairs, she looked into the study quickly, before rounding the corner. The living room was predictably empty, and the kitchen was too. Fearing that something may be horribly wrong, Asuka nearly threw the sliding door open, thinking to check whether the white truck was here or not. If it wasn't, then Asuka's world would likely come crashing down along with everything. Before she could take less than three steps in that direction, a voice came from the direction of the whicker chairs.

她急匆匆地走下楼梯，匆匆瞥了一眼书房，然后转过拐角。客厅如预料般空无一人，厨房也是。担心可能出了什么大问题，明日香几乎是用扔的打开了滑动门，想着去查看那辆白色卡车是否还在。如果不在，那么明日香的世界很可能就会随之崩塌。在她还没走出三步之前，一个声音从柳条椅的方向传来。

"Oh, decided to leave the bedroom I see."

“哦，决定离开卧室了，是吧。”

Asuka whirled around, and saw Shinji sitting there in one of the chairs. He had a book in one hand, and a cup raised nearly to his lips with steam coming off the top. He was reading by moonlight, but this was such a drastic change, that for a moment, Asuka didn't know how to respond.

明日香猛地转身，看到真嗣坐在其中一把椅子上。他一手拿着书，另一手举着杯子，杯口冒着热气。他在月光下阅读，但这一剧变让她一时不知如何回应。

"Do you want one?" asked Shinji, gesturing to the kettle beside the fire. "There's still plenty left."

"要来一杯吗？" 真嗣指着火堆旁的茶壶问道，"还剩不少呢。"

Asuka felt herself nodding, though she felt disconnected from her own body.

明日香感觉自己在点头，尽管她觉得自己与身体有些脱节。

Taking the cup that Shinji passed her, Asuka continued standing there, unsure of what to do. She was gazing down into the cup, able to see her own reflection in the tea thanks to the moonlight. Her expression was impossible to read, but even without the tea, there was a warmth that was slowly spreading throughout her body.

接过真嗣递来的杯子，明日香继续站在那里，不知该做什么。她低头凝视着杯中的茶水，借着月光，能在茶水中看到自己的倒影。她的表情难以捉摸，但即便没有茶水，一种温暖正逐渐在她体内蔓延开来。

"You can sit you know," mumbled Shinji, still looking at his book. "Or did you plan to go back upstairs again?"

"你可以坐下的，你知道，" 真嗣咕哝着，目光依旧停留在书上。"还是说你打算再回楼上去？"

"...No I'll sit," mumbled Asuka, speaking up.

"...不了，我坐下，" 明日香低声回应，声音稍稍提高了一些。

She sat down and sipped her tea slowly. The ice within her was beginning to thaw, but her outer body was assaulted by a wave of cold as a breeze blew across the patio. Shivering slightly, she sipped her tea again, and then looked over at Shinji, who was offering her a blanket.

她坐了下来，缓缓地啜饮着茶。她内心的冰冷开始融化，但身体却被一阵风吹过露台带来的寒意侵袭。她微微颤抖，再次啜饮了一口茶，然后看向真嗣，他正递给她一条毯子。

"Here, take it." “给，拿着。”

"...What about you?" "...那你呢？"

"You should know by now that cold doesn't really affect me. Besides, I brought that out here for you anyway."

"你应该早就知道，寒冷对我没什么影响。再说了，我本来就是为你带出来的。"

Asuka took this to mean that Shinji had the foresight to assume she would eventually come to him, given enough time. It annoyed her slightly, but it just showed how much he understood her.

明日香理解为，真嗣有先见之明，认为给她足够的时间，她最终会来找他。这让她有点不爽，但也显示了他对她的了解有多深。

"So...you've been waiting for me?"

"那么...你一直在等我？"

"More or less," said Shinji idly as he turned a page. "Did you want to talk?"

"或多或少吧，" 真嗣随意地翻了一页书，"你想聊聊吗？"

"...No, I can't," said Asuka quietly.

"...不，我不能，" 明日香轻声说道。"

"Is this a won't, or that you really can't?"

"这是不愿意，还是真的做不到？"

"I told you I can't, so I can't," said Asuka, her anger flaring up.

"我说了我做不到，就是做不到。" 明日香生气地说道。

"Okay, okay. Well, at least you seem to be in a better mood. I was wondering if I had done something to piss you off, though I really couldn't think of anything."

"好吧，好吧。不过，至少你看起来心情好些了。我还在想是不是做了什么惹你生气的事，虽然我真的想不出是什么。"

"No, it isn't anything like that," said Asuka, shaking her head.

"不，不是那样的，" 明日香摇着头说。

"I see." "我明白了。"

Shinji continued reading his book, and Asuka slowly drank her tea, stealing glancing over at Shinji. She was this close, and yet seemed so far at the same time. She wondered if Shinji understood what was happening, if it was happening to him as well. He could be incredibly dense at times, but even he must have some inkling about what was happening between them. Both fifteen, and in the midst of puberty: it was like fate was just waiting to strike.

真嗣继续读着他的书，而明日香则慢慢品着茶，不时偷偷瞥向真嗣。她近在咫尺，却又仿佛遥不可及。她想知道真嗣是否明白正在发生的事情，是否这一切也发生在他身上。他有时可能非常迟钝，但即便如此，他一定也隐约察觉到了他们之间正在发生的变化。两人都正值十五岁，青春期的浪潮中：命运似乎正蓄势待发。

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka suddenly.

“嘿，真嗣？”明日香突然问道。

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"Can I sit next to you?"

“我能坐在你旁边吗？”

Glancing over at her, Shinji said, "Aren't you already sitting beside me?"

真嗣瞥了她一眼，说：“你不是已经坐在我旁边了吗？”

"No, that isn't what I meant."

"不，我不是那个意思。"

Standing up, Asuka walked in front of where Shinji was sitting, gesturing for him to scoot over. Shinji didn't think this was reasonable, and though the chairs were larger than he was, fitting two people on it seemed impossible.

站起来后，明日香走到真嗣坐的地方前面，示意他挪一挪。真嗣觉得这不太合理，虽然椅子比他大，但要坐下两个人似乎是不可能的。

"Asuka this won't work. If you want to go inside, we can, but-"

"明日香，这行不通的。如果你想进去，我们可以进去，但是——"

"Than we can just do this instead."

“那我们可以改做这个。”

Throwing the blanket at him, it struck Shinji in the face, covering his vision momentarily. Struggling to pull it off, he felt a pressure pressing down on his legs. Pulling the blanket off, his eyes were staring right back into Asuka's ocean blue ones, directly in front of him. Almost falling over backwards in his surprise, Asuka began laughing, but corrected herself after noticing that if he fell over backwards, she would follow him. After steadying the chair, Shinji looked back at her, surprised that Asuka would be sitting in his lap in such a fashion.

她把毯子扔向他，正中真嗣的脸，暂时遮住了他的视线。他挣扎着扯下毯子，却发现眼前正是明日香那双湛蓝如海的眼睛，近在咫尺。他几乎惊得向后倒去，明日香开始大笑，但随即意识到如果他真的后仰，她也会跟着倒下。稳住椅子后，真嗣回头看她，惊讶于明日香竟会以这样的方式坐在他腿上。

"This isn't exactly comfortable," stated Shinji.

"这确实不太舒服，" 真嗣说道。

"You have a point," said Asuka, clearly uncomfortable herself. Asuka was sitting on Shinji's lap facing him, meaning that his legs were between hers. In reality, it was more uncomfortable for Asuka, for obvious reasons, though Shinji's discomfort was in more ways than one.

"你说得有道理，" 明日香说道，显然她自己也感到不适。明日香正坐在真嗣的腿上，面对着他，这意味着他的双腿夹在她的双腿之间。实际上，由于显而易见的原因，明日香感到更不舒服，尽管真嗣的不适感不止一种。

"Lets do this then," said Asuka.

"那我们就这么做吧，" 明日香说道。

Turning around, she sat on Shinji's legs with hers off to the side. With this, it was more difficult for her to stay upright however. Scooting closer towards him, Shinji had to brace himself as Asuka's moved further up his legs, dangerously close to his crouch.

她转过身，侧着腿坐在了真嗣的腿上。这样一来，她要保持直立就更困难了。她向他挪近了一些，真嗣不得不稳住自己，因为明日香的动作让她的位置更向上移，危险地靠近了他的胯部。

"There. This'll work," said Asuka brightly.

“好了，这样就行。”明日香明快地说道。

Shinji couldn't necessarily agree with her statement, but he held his tongue.

真嗣不一定同意她的话，但他保持了沉默。

Leaning into his chest, Asuka let out a low sigh, and then looked out over the grass bathed in moonlight. As she did this, because of how she was balanced, she almost fell backwards off Shinji's lap, but he reflexively grabbed her waist, steading her.

靠在他的胸前，明日香发出一声低叹，然后望向月光下沐浴的草地。由于她的平衡方式，她几乎要从真嗣的膝上向后摔倒，但他本能地抓住了她的腰，稳住了她。

"Thanks," said Asuka, her face slightly pink.

“谢谢，”明日香说道，她的脸颊微微泛红。

"Don't mention it," Shinji heard himself say.

"别客气，" 真嗣听到自己说道。

They sat in silence for a while, looking across the yard and the moon above them. When Asuka began to shiver, Shinji picked the blanket off the ground that he had tossed earlier, and wrapped it around himself and Asuka. Mumbling her thanks, Asuka looked behind her, and saw that Shinji was looking off into the distance as though thinking. If she wanted to, right now would probably be a good opportunity to kiss him, but she was also content enough with the situation that she didn't require it.

他们静静地坐了一会儿，眺望着院子和头顶的月亮。当明日香开始颤抖时，真嗣捡起之前扔在地上的毯子，把它裹在自己和明日香身上。明日香咕哝着道谢，回头一看，发现真嗣正望着远方，似乎在沉思。如果她愿意，现在可能是个吻他的好机会，但她对这个情况已经感到足够满足，不需要这么做。

"How long are we gonna stay like this?" asked Shinji.

"我们要这样待多久？" 真嗣问道。

"Why, do you not like this?"

“怎么，你不喜欢这个吗？”

"I wouldn't say that," Shinji muttered quietly, but he was thinking about his own self containment that was in jeopardy.

“我不会这么说。” 真嗣低声嘟囔着，心中却在担忧自己那岌岌可危的自我封闭。

"Then every things fine," grinned Asuka.

"那一切都好，" 明日香咧嘴笑道。

"I can't very well read like this though."

"这样我可没法好好看书啊。"

'How can he be wanting to read that stupid book of his right now," groaned Asuka inwardly.

“他怎么现在还想着读那本蠢书，”明日香内心抱怨道。

"You can do that any old time."

"你随时都可以做那件事。"

"Can't the same be said of this?"

"这不也是同样的道理吗？"

Rounding on him, Shinji could clearly see that he had said the wrong thing, and that Asuka was not happy about it.

转过身来面对他，真嗣清楚地看到自己说错了话，而且明日香对此很不高兴。

"...Sorry," mumbled Shinji. "I didn't mean it like that, just-"

"...对不起，" 真嗣咕哝道，"我不是那个意思，只是-"

"Just what?" asked Asuka, as she narrowed her eyes.

"只是什么？" 明日香眯起眼睛问道。

"Well, its not like we're gonna be separated anytime soon. So-"

"嗯，我们不会很快分开，所以-"

Asuka had thoroughly had enough of Shinji's feebleness. Grabbing his cheek, she tugged roughly on it so that their faces were now level with each other. Again, this was ample opportunity to kiss him, and Asuka would have liked to see Shinji's reaction, but she was beginning to get annoyed with him.

明日香已经受够了真嗣的软弱。她用力捏住他的脸颊，粗鲁地拉扯，使得两人的脸平齐相对。这本是个绝佳的接吻机会，明日香倒是很想看看真嗣的反应，但她开始对他感到厌烦了。

"While that may be true Shinji, can you honestly say you're content with things as they are."

“虽然那可能是真的，真嗣，你能诚实地告诉我，你对现状感到满意吗？”

"What do you mean?" he asked.

"你是什么意思？" 他问道。

"Shinji, you asked it once before, and so this time I'll ask it: what is our relationship currently?"

"真嗣，你之前问过一次，这次我来问：我们现在是什么关系？"

Two months ago, this would have been an easy question for Shinji to answer, even if back then, there was still a faint hesitancy, or wishful thinking of what things might become. Now he didn't know how to reply. They were still friends of course, but he didn't think simple friends acted the way they had begun to act around one another. More often than naught, Shinji had begun looking at Asuka in a different light, and was aware of his own desires towards her.

两个月前，这个问题对真嗣来说本该很容易回答，即便那时，他心中仍有一丝犹豫，或是对未来可能发生的变化抱有幻想。现在他却不知如何作答。他们当然还是朋友，但他觉得普通朋友不会像他们那样相处。真嗣越来越多地用不同的眼光看待明日香，并意识到自己对她的渴望。

"Can't answer that? Or is it that you don't want to? Well, either way is fine honestly. I don't really care."

"答不上来吗？还是你不想回答？说实话，哪种都无所谓。我其实并不在意。"

Asuka flat out lied here, and Shinji rather suspected it, but he said nothing. He wasn't sure if he should charge ahead with what his heart was telling him, or to hold back.

明日香在这里完全撒了谎，真嗣对此颇有疑虑，但他什么也没说。他不确定是该听从内心的指引勇往直前，还是应该克制自己。

Asuka wasn't looking at him anymore however. There was an unanswerable question floating above both their heads, and she had mentioned it. Shinji obviously knew this as well, but hadn't said anything. If he had said something, Asuka wondered how she would have responded. Would they even still be sitting here, or would they be halfway up the stairs at this point? Or would everything just happen right here?

然而，明日香已经不再看他了。一个无解的问题悬浮在他们头顶，她提到了它。真嗣显然也知道这一点，但什么也没说。如果他说了什么，明日香想知道她会如何回应。他们还会坐在这里吗，还是已经走到楼梯的一半了？或者一切都会在这里发生？

"I think I'm going to bed," said Asuka. Standing up, she looked down at Shinji and asked, "Well, are you coming, or are you going to continue reading your stupid book?"

“我想我要去睡觉了，”明日香说道。她站起来，低头看着真嗣问道：“那么，你是要来，还是继续读你那本愚蠢的书？”

Shinji wasn't looking at her, but was staring down at his own feet. Now that Asuka had removed herself from his lap, he wanted her back more than ever. If would be a simple thing to reach out and grab her by the waist, pulling her back towards him.

真嗣没有看她，而是盯着他自己的脚。现在明日香已经从他腿上离开，他比以往任何时候都更想让她回来。伸手抓住她的腰，把她拉回自己身边，这将是件简单的事。

The silence persisted, and Asuka was about to just walk away from him when Shinji stood up.

沉默持续着，就在明日香准备从他身边走开时，真嗣站了起来。

"Yeah, I will." “嗯，我会去的。”

They didn't say anything to each other as they walked upstairs and entered the bedroom. Asuka spent some time in the bathroom before getting under the covers and almost immediately rolled to her side of the bed, wrapping the blankets around herself. Shinji slowly changed into his sleepwear, and then hesitated before getting in bed. He didn't think Asuka was asleep, but she didn't roll over to sleep next to him like in the past.

他们上楼进入卧室时，彼此间没有说一句话。明日香在浴室里待了一会儿，然后钻进被窝，几乎立刻就滚到床的一侧，用毯子把自己裹紧。真嗣慢慢换上睡衣，犹豫了一下才上床。他觉得明日香还没睡着，但她没有像过去那样翻身过来睡在他旁边。

As he lay awake thinking, Shinji realized that he couldn't leave things like this. Even if it was only another small step, he needed to do something.

躺在床上辗转反侧之际，真嗣意识到他不能就这样放任不管。即便只是迈出一小步，他也必须采取行动。

Turning towards the lump that was Asuka, he called her name softly.

他转向那个蜷缩成一团的身影，轻声呼唤她的名字。

"Asuka, you awake?" “明日香，你醒着吗？”

She didn't respond, but Shinji didn't think she could fall asleep that fast. They didn't really have an argument, but it felt like there was a road block between them right now.

她没有回应，但真嗣不认为她能那么快入睡。他们并没有真正争吵，但此刻却感觉有一堵墙横亘在他们之间。

"Asuka, I want to talk to you."

“明日香，我想和你谈谈。”

She didn't reply, but low breathing could be heard from her side of the bed now.

她没有回答，但从床的另一侧传来了轻微的呼吸声。

"Asuka!" Shinji said louder.

"明日香！" 真嗣提高了声音。

The breathing stopped, but still she didn't reply to him. Finally working himself up, Shinji moved to her side of the bed, and then pulled against her shoulder, turning her towards him. As he had assumed, she was awake, her eyes wide and staring back at him. Her hair was spread out beneath her, and Shinji could just barely make out her expression in the dim moonlight. She did not seem happy.

呼吸停止了，但她仍然没有回应他。最终鼓起勇气，真嗣移到床的另一侧，然后拉住她的肩膀，将她转向自己。正如他所料，她醒着，眼睛睁得大大的，直视着他。她的头发散落在枕头上，在昏暗的月光下，真嗣勉强能辨认出她的表情。她看起来并不高兴。

"What?" she asked harshly. "If you want to make more excuses, then leave it. I'm going to sleep."

"干嘛？" 她粗鲁地问道。"如果你想找更多借口，那就省省吧。我要睡觉了。"

Attempting to turn back over, Shinji kept his hand firmly on her shoulder, but gently. He couldn't say it, not now, at least. But he could still take another step forward at the very least.

试图翻身回去，但真嗣的手坚定而温柔地搭在她的肩上。他现在还说不出口，至少不是现在。但他至少还能再向前迈出一步。

Leaning over her, Shinji brought his face mere inches away from hers so that their foreheads were now touching. This happened so quickly, that Asuka didn't even have time to utter a sound. Moments later, he kissed her at the corner of her lips.

俯身靠近她，真嗣将脸凑到离她仅几英寸的地方，以至于他们的额头相触。这一切发生得太快，明日香甚至来不及发出一声。片刻之后，他在她的唇角轻轻一吻。

Just like that, it was over, and Shinji was moving away from her, but an electric spark had been triggered within Asuka's body. Maybe because of events earlier in the day, and how Asuka had been controlling herself as best as she could, but when Shinji's lips made contact with the corner of her own, her whole body tingled with pleasure. Fighting back at this point seemed altogether pointless.

就这样，一切结束了，真嗣正从她身边移开，但一道电流已在明日香体内被触发。或许是因为当天早些时候的事件，以及明日香如何尽力控制自己，但当真嗣的唇触碰到她自己的唇角时，她的全身都因愉悦而颤抖。此时再反抗似乎毫无意义。

Throwing aside her covers, she rolled over to Shinji, who had not been expecting this change, and wrapped her arms around his back, pressing her body against his. Her legs found his, and entwined themselves together, while Shinji was still trying to put two and two together. He himself was starting to lose self control, and was overly conscious of Asuka's budding breasts pressing against his chest.

她甩开被子，翻身靠近真嗣，他并未预料到这一变化，她用双臂环抱住他的背部，将身体紧贴着他。她的腿找到了他的，缠绕在一起，而真嗣仍在努力理清思绪。他自己也开始失去自制力，对明日香初绽的胸部紧贴在他胸前感到格外在意。

Asuka looked up at him then. She was biting down on her lips in a seductive way, and Shinji very nearly kissed her directly then, but Asuka struck first. Since she was closer to his neck than his lips, she sank her teeth into the nape of his neck. Shinji's surprise at this was so pronounced that he almost struggled away from her, but Asuka held him there.

那一刻，明日香抬头望向他。她以一种诱人的方式咬着嘴唇，真嗣几乎就要直接吻上她了，但明日香抢先一步。由于她离他的脖子比嘴唇更近，她便咬住了他的后颈。真嗣对此感到如此惊讶，以至于他差点从她身边挣脱，但明日香紧紧地抓住了他。

Still, it seemed that the white fog that had been enveloping Asuka's mind seemed to have subsided, and she was realizing what she had just done. Her face began to turn red, and she forced her head against Shinji's upper chest so hard that she almost pushed him off the bed. She was panting lightly, and was now in control over her hormones once again. If she had continued like that, it probably would only have been a matter of time...

然而，笼罩在明日香心头的白雾似乎已经消散，她开始意识到自己刚才的所作所为。她的脸颊泛起红晕，用力将头埋进真嗣的胸口，几乎将他推下床去。她轻声喘息，终于再次掌控了自己的荷尔蒙。如果她继续那样下去，恐怕只是时间问题...

"Um...Asuka?" “呃...明日香？”

Asuka groaned loudly but didn't say anything; she seemed too embarrassed to speak right now. Her arms were no longer wrapped around his back, but were now resting against his chest.

明日香大声地呻吟了一声，但没有说话；她似乎太尴尬了，此刻说不出话来。她的手臂不再环抱在他的背上，而是现在靠在他的胸前。

In spite of what had just transpired, Shinji couldn't help but smile slightly. Asuka nuzzled her head against Shinji's chest slowly, until she finally began drifting off. When she finally had, Shinji placed his hand over the spot on his neck where she had bit. Most likely, there'd be a mark there tomorrow morning to remind Asuka of what she did, but Shinji knew better than to bring it up.

尽管刚刚发生了那样的事，真嗣还是忍不住微微一笑。明日香慢慢地将头靠在真嗣的胸前，直到她终于开始昏昏欲睡。当她终于睡着时，真嗣把手放在她咬过的脖子上的那个位置。很可能，明天早上那里会有个痕迹提醒明日香她做了什么，但真嗣知道最好不要提起这件事。

'Well, whatever,' thought Shinji. He bared some responsibility for this as well, since he had kissed her initially, though Asuka's reaction was unexpected. At the same time however, it explained a lot as well.

“唉，随便吧，”真嗣心想。他对此也负有一定责任，毕竟是他先吻了她，尽管明日香的反应出乎意料。但与此同时，这也解释了许多。

'I guess that just shows how strong her feelings are.'

我想这恰恰证明了她的感情有多强烈。

Glancing down at her sleeping face that was still pressed against his chest, he whispered, "Goodnight Asuka," before kissing her softly on the forehead, and then shortly fell asleep himself.

他低头看着她紧贴在他胸前熟睡的脸庞，轻声说道：“晚安，明日香。”随后温柔地在她额头上落下一吻，不久自己也沉入了梦乡。

So its very clear that the tension between Shinji and Asuka is reaching a certain point, but just to reiterate something I said a long while ago in SoA, I don't have any intention of making them have sex at their current age of fifteen. Take this as you will, though more will be explained in the next chapter.

很明显，真嗣和明日香之间的紧张关系已经到了某个临界点，但正如我很久以前在《SoA》中所说，我并不打算让他们在十五岁的年纪发生性关系。你可以随意解读这一点，不过更多解释将在下一章节《chapter》中展开。

At the outset of Two of Us, I wanted to create a very stark contrast between how Shinji grew with his AT-field in SoA, and this. In SoA, he was largely fueled by anger, and grew thanks to his constant pressure by the people around him, and his interactions with the Evangelions and Angels. Without those things, his progression is much slower, but he is more in control. I'd describe Shinji in SoA as a street brawler that has no technique, and just throws haymaker after haymaker.

在《我们俩》的开篇，我想要创造一个非常鲜明的对比，展示真嗣在《SoA》中如何通过 AT 力场成长，以及这里的不同。在《SoA》中，他主要受愤怒驱使，并在周围人的持续压力以及与 EVA 和使徒的互动中成长。没有这些因素，他的进步虽然慢了许多，但更加可控。我会形容《SoA》中的真嗣就像一个没有技巧的街头斗殴者，只会一拳接一拳地猛击。

With that said, look forward to the next chapter.

话虽如此，敬请期待下一章 chapter。

### Chapter 24: Passion

Merry Christmas, or Christmas eve as it turns out to be. Figured I'd post this on the 24th instead of tomorrow, considering that fanfiction was down Christmas day last year. Hard to believe its been a year since them as well. I'm gonna be talking about stuff at the end of this, but in the mean time, enjoy this rather suitable chapter.

圣诞快乐，或者说是圣诞前夜。我决定在 24 号发布这个，而不是明天，考虑到去年圣诞节那天粉丝小说网站宕机了。很难相信已经过去一年了。我会在最后谈论一些事情，但在此之前，请享受这个相当合适的 chapter。

---

It didn't require Asuka seeing the mark on Shinji's neck to make her blush furiously when she woke up. At some point during the night, Shinji must have managed to wrap both his arms around her, and Asuka didn't think it possible that she could be any closer to him. His chin was resting on top of her head, and their hips were crushed against one another. It didn't take long for the sleepiness to disappear from Asuka, when she felt something poking against her hips. Quick as a flash, she darted away from him upon realizing what it was. Shinji didn't wake up, but only breathed heavily, and then turned onto his side away from her.

不需要明日香看到真嗣脖子上的痕迹，她醒来时就已经满脸通红。夜里某个时刻，真嗣一定设法用双臂抱住了她，明日香觉得她不可能再和他更亲近了。他的下巴靠在她的头顶，他们的臀部紧紧相贴。当她感觉到有什么东西顶着她的臀部时，睡意很快就消失了。她立刻意识到那是什么，迅速从他身边闪开。真嗣没有醒来，只是沉重地呼吸着，然后转身背对着她。

Asuka felt her heart pounding against her chest, and placed a hand over it to confirm the beating of her own heart. That had been a rather severe shock, but Asuka understood enough about male anatomy to know that it was a normal reaction early in the morning. That didn't make the feel of it pressing again her hips lessen anymore though.

明日香感到心脏在胸腔内猛烈跳动，她用手按住胸口以确认自己的心跳。那确实是一次相当严重的惊吓，但明日香对男性生理有所了解，知道清晨时分出现这种反应是正常的。尽管如此，那种感觉压在她臀部上的力度并未因此减轻。

Trying to shake off these thoughts, she changed into something more suitable, and then walked into the bathroom. Reaching into a far back corner of the closet, she grabbed the bundled up sheets that she had stored there yesterday, and then quietly left the bedroom.

她试图摆脱这些思绪，换上更合适的衣服，然后走进浴室。她伸手到衣柜最深处，抓起昨天藏在那里的床单，然后悄悄离开了卧室。

She couldn't risk leaving them in the house, so that left the only option of driving someplace nearby, and leaving them there. She was feeling paranoid about the whole ordeal, but with realizing that they had come far closer last night to dangerous territory than she was comfortable with, she didn't want to take any chances.

她不敢把它们留在家里，这样一来，唯一的选择就是开车去附近某个地方，把它们留在那里。她对整个事件感到多疑，但意识到昨晚他们险些踏入危险境地，这让她不愿冒任何风险。

Stepping into the station wagon, she carefully backed out of the driveway, and then drove further down the road. This was her first time driving past their house in this direction, so she took her time slowly, looking at the houses and the yards as she did. Choosing a house at random, she parked in front of the garage. She was thankful that the side door to the garage opened without a problem, and then secretly stored the sheets in a far corner, piling oddments of stuff upon the white cotton.

她踏进旅行车，小心翼翼地倒车出车道，然后继续沿着道路前行。这是她第一次从这个方向开车经过他们的房子，所以她慢慢来，一边开车一边观察着沿途的房屋和庭院。随意选择了一栋房子，她把车停在了车库前。她很庆幸车库侧门毫无问题地打开了，于是偷偷将床单藏在角落里，用一些杂物堆在洁白的棉布上。

Afterwards, she hurried back home, but when she slowly sneaked back upstairs, she saw that Shinji was still fast asleep. She had been immensely worried that he might wake up, realize that she wasn't there, and begin asking questions about where she was.

之后，她急忙赶回家，但当她悄悄溜回楼上时，发现真嗣仍然熟睡着。她之前非常担心他可能会醒来，发现她不在，然后开始询问她去了哪里。

With this said and done, Asuka took her time preparing breakfast. In reality, she was hardly paying attention to what she was doing. Her thought were filled with Shinji, and how she had behaved last night. It had been as much a surprise to Shinji, as it was to her. She could hardly remember kissing him on the neck, but it had happened, and Asuka was overly aware of the growing tension between them. If she had been told that she'd begin to feel this way towards Shinji when they first met each other back in Tokyo-3, she would have spit in that persons face.

话已至此，明日香不紧不慢地准备着早餐。实际上，她几乎没怎么注意自己在做什么。她的思绪全被真嗣占据，想着昨晚自己的行为。这对真嗣来说同样出乎意料，对她亦然。她几乎记不清自己吻了他的脖子，但确实发生了，明日香深切感受到两人间日益紧张的气氛。如果当初在东京-3 初次相遇时有人告诉她会对真嗣产生这种感觉，她可能会朝那人脸上吐口水。

The electric shock she had felt when he kissed her at the corner of her lips was nothing like she had ever felt before. It was like waves of ecstasy had rippled through her body, starting at her head, and traveling all the way down her legs. It was pleasurable to say the least, though in a strange way that Asuka hadn't experienced before.

当他吻在她唇角时，她感受到的电击般的震撼是她从未体验过的。仿佛一波波极乐的浪潮从头顶涌向双腿，那种愉悦感怎么说都不为过，尽管是一种明日香之前未曾体验过的奇妙方式。

But still, if she hadn't recovered from that moment of lapse in judgement, or if Shinji had kissed her afterwards, she may have thrown caution to the wind. Asuka didn't want to think about 'what if scenarios,' but the truth was there.

然而，如果她没有从那次判断失误的瞬间恢复过来，或者真嗣之后又吻了她，她可能会不顾一切。明日香不想去想那些'如果'的情景，但事实摆在眼前。

There was still the unanswerable question between them that Asuka had mentioned before. It seemed that neither had any lingering doubts with regards to that, but there was still much that hadn't been spoken. They were very much feeling and testing the waters, but if they misstepped, it would be a long plunge into the icy depths. Asuka was more aware of this now more than ever, now that she had had her first blood.

在他们之间，仍然存在着阿斯卡之前提到过的那个无法回答的问题。似乎双方对此都没有任何疑虑，但仍有许多未曾言明的事情。他们正感受并试探着彼此的界限，但一旦失足，便会坠入冰冷的深渊。阿斯卡现在比以往任何时候都更加意识到这一点，尤其是在她经历了第一次之后。

Stirring the pot slowly, Asuka tasted the soup, before deeming it good enough. At this moment, the sliding door opened, and Shinji stepped out onto the patio.

阿斯卡慢慢地搅拌着锅里的汤，尝了一口后，觉得已经足够好了。就在这时，滑动门打开了，真嗣走到了露台上。

"I'm surprised to see you up early," said Shinji as he yawned.

“没想到你这么早就起来了，”真嗣打着哈欠说道。

"I woke up rather suddenly, and didn't really feel like going back to sleep," said Asuka half truthfully. As she went to hand him a bowl, her eyes fond the spot on his neck which her teeth had latched onto. Her face changed several shades, but she didn't comment on it, and neither did Shinji.

“我醒得相当突然，不太想再睡了。”明日香半真半假地说道。当她递给他一碗时，她的目光落在了他脖子上她曾咬过的地方。她的脸色变了好几回，但她没有提及，真嗣也没有。

They ate in silence, both being absorbed in there own thoughts regarding the other. Even just sitting next to each other like this was almost unbearable. Shinji was constantly glancing over at her, his eyes roving along her body, lingering multiple times on her lips. He had wished that she was still sleeping beside him when he woke up, and would have liked nothing better than to give her a good morning kiss.

他们默默地用餐，各自沉浸在对彼此的思绪中。仅仅是这样并肩而坐，几乎已难以忍受。真嗣不时瞥向她，目光在她身上游走，多次停留在她的唇上。他多么希望醒来时她仍在身旁熟睡，更渴望能给她一个早安吻。

When Shinji was done eating, Asuka wordlessly their bowls, and then washed them clean, storing them away in the kitchen. She busied herself around the kitchen for a while, trying to lose herself in something, anything, just to keep her mind off Shinji. Though when he went inside and sat by the fireplace, reading his book, she found this almost impossible. Finally giving up, she walked into the living room, and sat down on the recliner beside the couch. She didn't think she could handle sitting beside him right now, and didn't want to risk another incident.

当真嗣吃完饭后，明日香默默地收拾了碗筷，然后洗净，存放在厨房里。她在厨房里忙碌了一阵，试图让自己沉浸在任何事情中，只为不去想真嗣。然而，当他走进屋内，坐在壁炉旁读他的书时，她发现这几乎是不可能的。最终放弃挣扎，她走进客厅，坐在沙发旁的躺椅上。她觉得此刻无法坐在他旁边，也不想冒险再次发生意外。

"Did you want to do anything today?" asked Shinji, idly turning a page. Though he asked this, Shinji didn't look over at her. Asuka wasn't put off by this, but just assumed that Shinji was also doing his best to limit any close interactions between them right now.

“你今天想做点什么吗？”真嗣随意翻了一页问道。虽然他这么问，但真嗣并没有看向她。明日香对此并不介意，只是认为真嗣也在尽力避免他们之间过于亲密的互动。

"No, I don't think so," said Asuka slowly.

“不，我想没有，”明日香缓缓说道。

"Alright," said Shinji as he shrugged and returned to his book.

“好吧，”真嗣说着耸了耸肩，又回到他的书本上。

Asuka continued sitting there for a while, gazing into the empty fireplace for a long while, before she stood up and walked upstairs. When Shinji couldn't hear her footsteps anymore, he closed his book with a snap. He had been reading the same paragraph repeatedly, unable to focus on the words written. Setting it down on the table in front of him, he ran both hands over his face, trying to shake away his nervousness. Asuka was beginning to become too much for him to handle.

明日香继续在那里坐了一会儿，凝视着空荡荡的壁炉许久，然后才起身走上楼。当真嗣再也听不到她的脚步声时，他啪的一声合上了书。他一直在反复阅读同一段落，无法集中注意力在文字上。他将书放在面前的桌子上，双手捂住脸，试图驱散自己的紧张感。明日香开始变得让他难以应付。

Those many months ago, far back in Tokyo-3 came to his mind when he had first discovered her lying on the beach. Even then, he had thought Asuka beautiful, though with a rather rotten personality when they had first met. She had thawed completely since then, and just seeing her grin directed at him set his heart fluttering wildly. Last night came as a surprise to Shinji, seeing just how forceful Asuka could become. It was a far cry from how she had acted when they had first met. Shinji didn't know how much longer he could hold himself back.

许多个月前，在东京-3 的往事浮现在脑海中，那时他第一次在海滩上发现她躺在那里。即便那时，他也觉得明日香很美，尽管初次见面时她的性格相当糟糕。自那以后，她已经完全变得温柔了，只要看到她对着他笑，他的心就狂跳不已。昨晚对真嗣来说是个惊喜，见识到了明日香可以变得多么强势。这与他们初次见面时的表现大相径庭。真嗣不知道自己还能坚持多久。

The truth of the matter was, is that he wanted Asuka. He wanted to hold her strongly against himself. To kiss her deeply, to run his hands through her hair, to-

事实是，他想要明日香。他想紧紧地拥她入怀。深深地吻她，抚摸她的秀发，还有——

'Don't start imagining stuff,' Shinji told himself. Unfortunately, he found this harder and harder as the days went on.

'别开始胡思乱想了，'真嗣对自己说。不幸的是，随着时间的推移，他发现这越来越难。

Standing up, he decided that what he needed was some fresh air.

他站起身来，决定自己需要一些新鲜空气。

Walking upstairs, he entered their bedroom, and saw that Asuka wasn't in the bed, but instead the bathroom doors were closed.

他走上楼，进入他们的卧室，发现明日香不在床上，反而是浴室门紧闭着。

Knocking on the door, he asked, "You in there Asuka?"

他敲了敲门，问道：“明日香，你在里面吗？”

There was silence for several seconds before Asuka replied with, "...Yeah."

几秒钟的沉默后，明日香才回答道：“……嗯。”

"I'm gonna go out for a while, just letting you know."

"我出去一会儿，跟你说一声。"

"...Okay." "...好的。"

Shinji remained by the door for several seconds, wondering if something was wrong, but Asuka didn't seem to be in any trouble.

真嗣在门口停留了几秒，想知道是不是有什么不对劲，但明日香看起来并没有遇到麻烦。

Leaving the house, Shinji opened the door to his truck, and climbed up into the drive seat. Starting the truck, he glanced into the rearview mirror, and thought he saw the curtain of the bedroom window pulled back slightly. Shaking his head, he pulled out of their driveway, and up the hill.

离开房子，真嗣打开卡车车门，爬上驾驶座。启动卡车后，他瞥了一眼后视镜，似乎看到卧室窗帘被轻轻拉回了一点。他摇摇头，驶出他们的车道，向山上开去。

Meanwhile, Asuka stepped back from the window, and sank down onto the bed. Her eyes were slightly moist, but her heart was the most troubled. If she could just be honest with herself, then maybe this tension could evaporate, but she couldn't blame herself entirely. Shinji as well was feeling tense and nervous, which was clear since he had left to likely attempt to clear his mind. Just being within the same house was causing these waves of emotions between them. On the one hand, they very clearly wanted each other, but felt unable to take another step. They were still very much children in this regard.

与此同时，明日香从窗边退开，坐到床上。她的眼睛微微湿润，但内心最为烦乱。如果她能对自己坦诚，或许这种紧张感就会消散，但她不能完全责怪自己。真嗣同样感到紧张和不安，这从他离开去试图理清思绪的行为中显而易见。仅仅是在同一屋檐下就引发了他们之间的情绪波动。一方面，他们显然渴望彼此，却感到无法再迈出一步。在这方面，他们仍然是非常孩子气的。

Shinji hardly payed any attention to where he was going, but ended up following the familiar path of the logging trail he had created yesterday. He had no intention of cutting down any trees, or even practicing with his AT-field for that matter. He had just wanted someplace quiet to think for a while.

真嗣几乎没有留意自己前行的方向，却不知不觉间沿着昨天开辟的伐木小径走去。他并无意砍伐任何树木，更不用说练习 AT 力场了。他只是想找个安静的地方独自思考片刻。

Stepping out of the truck, he let the tailgate of the truck fall down, and climbed up to sit on it. The sounds of nature were all around him, and because of his enhanced senses, if he paused and listened, he could hear other things normal humans couldn't distinguish. The sounds of birds softy communicating to each other in trees above him, the sounds of acorns falling from the trees to eventually sprout new ones. The wind carefully picking up individual grains of dirt and flinging them into the air. All sorts of creatures crawling in the dirt below him, living as they will.

他走出卡车，任由尾门落下，爬上去坐在上面。大自然的各种声音环绕着他，由于他敏锐的感官，只要他停下来聆听，就能听到普通人无法分辨的声音。鸟儿在头顶的树梢间轻声交流，橡果从树上落下，最终萌发新芽的声音。风小心翼翼地卷起单个的泥土颗粒，将它们抛向空中。各种各样的生物在他脚下的泥土中爬行，随心所欲地生活着。

Raising up his hand as high as he could, he peered through the gaps in his hand, and the trees above him, to look at the sun high in the sky. What did he want to do with this hand? What did he want to grasp with this hand? Where did he want to go with this body? What did he want to do with this body? How much of this was all wound up within his feelings for Asuka? Nearly all of it of course.

他竭尽全力将手举高，透过指间的缝隙和头顶的树冠，仰望高悬天空的太阳。他要用这只手做什么？他想用这只手抓住什么？他要带着这副身躯去往何方？他想用这副身躯做什么？这一切有多少是缠绕在他对明日香的感情中的？当然，几乎全部。

Asuka was an existence that Shinji was able to connect with, and despite revelations of who he was, the world they lived in, or the past lives that they might have shared, she threw it all away, and promised that she would never leave him. More than once, Shinji wondered if he deserved her affection, because of who he was. There was a strong possibility that he wasn't human, a being similar to an angel, something that she had once sworn to fight against. But she had ignored that, and accepted Shinji as who he was.

明日香是真嗣能够与之相连的存在，尽管关于他的身份、他们所生活的世界或他们可能共享的过去生活的真相被揭露，她却抛弃了一切，承诺永远不会离开他。不止一次，真嗣怀疑自己是否配得上她的爱，因为他自己的身份。他很可能不是人类，而是类似于天使的存在，这是她曾经发誓要与之战斗的东西。但她忽略了这一点，接受了真嗣本来的样子。

What could he do then in turn, of her who had accepted him as he was? To hold her in times of trouble? To sooth her in times of worry? To stay with her until death reached both of them? All of these things and many more Shinji knew. Whether more humans came back was no longer a question of 'would Shinji and Asuka continued this shared existence,' but the fact that it would be so.

那么，对于接受了他本来的她，他能做些什么呢？在困难时刻拥抱她？在忧虑时刻安慰她？陪伴她直到死亡降临到他们两人身上？所有这些事情以及更多的事情，真嗣都知道。是否会有更多的人类回来，不再是‘真嗣和明日香是否会继续这种共享的存在’的问题，而是事实将会如此。

Unspeakably, Shinji suddenly felt himself leaving his current plane of existence. At first, he didn't realize what was happening, but then, it had been two months since December afterall. Visions flashed by him so fast that he was unable to get a glimpse of them for more than a second. He saw himself and Asuka happily sitting on the patio of their house, wrapped in each other arms, two glasses of wine in front of them. He saw brief images of them driving too and from different places, either in the station wagon, or the truck. An image of them laughing happily while sitting on the couch; breakfast in bed in the morning; Asuka ordering him around as they spent another winter together; kissing deeply while tangled in the blankets of their bed. All sorts of images and possibilities flew by Shinji until he felt like his brain couldn't contain it all. Everything was with Asuka though, and that was the only thing that mattered to Shinji.

难以言喻地，真嗣突然感到自己正离开当前的存在层面。起初，他并未意识到发生了什么，但转眼间，已是十二月后的两个月。幻象以迅雷不及掩耳之势掠过他，让他连一秒钟的清晰都无法捕捉。他看见自己和明日香幸福地坐在自家露台上，相拥而坐，面前摆着两杯红酒。他瞥见他们驾车往返于不同地点，时而驾驶旅行车，时而开卡车。一幅幅画面闪现：他们坐在沙发上开怀大笑；清晨在床上共进早餐；明日香指挥着他，共度又一个寒冬；在床上的被褥中深情拥吻。各种画面与可能性如潮水般涌向真嗣，让他感觉大脑几乎无法容纳这一切。但所有这些画面中，都有明日香的存在，而这正是真嗣心中唯一重要的。

As everything began slowing down though, and the visions became steadily fewer and far between, Shinji glimpsed an image of Asuka with tears in her eyes, and in what appeared to be pain. The image vanished so suddenly that Shinji didn't have time to think about it however, and something else was approaching as well. There was something else mixed within all these visions. Shinji felt darkness starting to seep into the possibilities that passed him, all more wild then the other. He felt his brain rattling around in his skull, and tried to shut out the pain that he was suddenly feeling.

然而，随着一切逐渐放缓，幻象也变得稀少而遥远，真嗣瞥见明日香眼中含泪，似乎正承受着痛苦。这画面突如其来地消失了，真嗣甚至来不及细想，因为还有其他事物正在逼近。在这些幻象中混杂着某种东西。真嗣感到黑暗开始渗入那些掠过他的可能性中，一个比一个狂野。他感到自己的大脑在头骨内颤动，努力屏蔽突然袭来的痛楚。

At the end, something loomed above Shinji. He heard voices all around him, voices which he had never heard before. Thousands, if not millions of people were all speaking at once, each of their voices wanting to be heard. There was some great debate happening between them, but all were crying about the same thing. What this was, Shinji couldn't understand, as the voices rose and fell like the sound of waves until it was a tumultuous roar. Several people seemed to be at the center however, the voices of reason and power, spurring the others on. Chaos ensued and the voices became even louder, until Shinji had to try and close his ears, but they were echoing in his mind.

最终，有什么东西笼罩在真嗣上方。他听到周围传来从未听过的声音，成千上万甚至上百万的人同时说话，每个声音都渴望被听见。他们之间正在进行一场激烈的辩论，但所有人都在为同一件事哭泣。真嗣无法理解这是什么，因为这些声音像海浪一样起伏不定，直到变成一片喧嚣的轰鸣。然而，有几个人似乎处于中心，他们的声音理智而有力，激励着其他人。混乱随之而来，声音变得更加响亮，直到真嗣不得不试图捂住耳朵，但它们仍在脑海中回响。

Pain suddenly shot through his mind, as he saw something, and he screamed in pain. His scream was real, and it exploded in the clearing around him. Unwillingly, he felt his AT-field surge upward into the sky above the clearing, exploding out from within him. Grasping ahold of his pounding mind, he forcefully dissipated his AT-field with a wave of his arm, and then fell back into the bed of the truck.

突然间，一阵剧痛穿透了他的脑海，他看到了什么，痛苦地尖叫起来。他的尖叫是真实的，在周围的空地上爆发开来。不情愿地，他感觉到自己的 AT 力场向着空地上方的天空涌去，从他体内爆发出来。他紧紧抓住自己剧烈跳动的头脑，用力挥动手臂，强行驱散了 AT 力场，然后倒回了卡车上的床铺。

Shinji didn't know how long he lay there for, but he felt like his consciousness slipped in and out of reality for some time before he sat up again.

真嗣不知道自己在那里躺了多久，但他感觉自己的意识在现实与虚幻之间游离了一段时间，然后才再次坐起身来。

'What had happened?' was the first thing that came to his mind, but the fact that he had had a vision was obvious. This was altogether different however, as he had never seen this many possibilities all at once, and the possibility at the end. He didn't know what he had seen, or felt, but it had very clearly affected his mind. There was so much wound up together within what he saw, that it was impossible to make heads or tails of anything. He had long come to know that what he saw wasn't concrete fact, but it still worried him.

‘发生了什么？’是他脑海中浮现的第一个问题，但很明显，他经历了一次幻象。然而，这一次完全不同，因为他从未一次看到过这么多可能性，以及最后的那种可能性。他不知道自己看到了什么，感受到了什么，但它显然影响到了他的心智。他所见的一切交织在一起，以至于无法理清任何头绪。他早已知道他所见并非确凿事实，但这仍让他感到忧虑。

Wiping sweat off his forehead, he looked down at his arm. Had he unconsciously used his AT-field because of what he had seen? Was what he saw so bad that it provoked an unconscious usage of his AT-field? Clasping and unclasping his hand, he wondered what could possibly have created that reaction.

他擦去额头上的汗水，低头看着自己的手臂。是因为他所见之物，他才无意识地使用了 AT 力场吗？他所见之物是否如此糟糕，以至于引发了无意识地使用 AT 力场？他握紧又松开手，思索着究竟是什么引发了那样的反应。

Shinji's brain was in tatters, but since he didn't know how much time had passed, he shakily got into the truck, and slowly drove his way out of the clearing. His head still hurt from the pain earlier, but as he looked at his reflection in the mirror, he saw that he was deathly pale. He hoped that his complexion would clear up by the time he got home, but he didn't have much faith in this.

真嗣的思绪一片混乱，但由于不知时间流逝了多少，他颤抖着爬上卡车，缓缓驶离空地。先前的疼痛仍令他头痛不已，但当他从后视镜中看向自己的倒影时，发现自己的脸色苍白如纸。他希望到家时气色能好转些，但对此并不抱太大希望。

After thirty minutes or so, he pulled into the driveway of their house, and stepped out of the truck. His head still hurt, and he looked slightly better than when he had left the clearing, but he still felt strange.

大约三十分钟后，他将车驶入自家车道，从卡车上下来。他的头依然疼痛，看起来比离开空地时稍好一些，但他仍感到异样。

As he walked around the patio to the sliding glass door, he saw that Asuka had come out to greet him. When she saw him, she could immediately tell that something was wrong.

当他绕过露台走向滑动玻璃门时，他注意到明日香已经出来迎接他了。她一看到他，立刻察觉到有些不对劲。

"Shinji are you okay?"

“真嗣，你还好吗？”

"Yeah, fine," Shinji heard himself reply, though his head felt like a pinball machine right now.

“嗯，没事，”真嗣听到自己回答，尽管他的头现在感觉像是个弹球机。

"You're lying," stated Asuka.

“你在撒谎，”明日香断言道。

"I'm fine," Shinji said again. As he said this, fresh pain seared his head, and he reflexively reached up to hold it. He very nearly stumbled, and this was when Asuka took matters into her own hands.

"我没事，" 真嗣再次说道。就在他说这话时，新一波的剧痛刺穿了他的头部，他本能地伸手去捂。他差点踉跄跌倒，这时明日香决定亲自出手。

"You're not fine, and being incredibly stupid. Come here."

"你根本不好，还蠢得要命。过来。"

Grabbing his arm and placing it on her shoulder, Asuka was able to drag Shinji through the door and into the living room. Walking up the stairs would prove too difficult Asuka judged, so she set him on the couch, and went to get him something to drink. Shinji's head felt like it would split open any second, and when Asuka gave him the water, he downed the whole bottle in four gulps.

明日香抓住他的手臂，搭在自己的肩上，就这样拖着真嗣穿过门进入客厅。她判断上楼梯对他来说太困难了，于是把他安置在沙发上，然后去给他拿点喝的。真嗣的头感觉随时都要裂开似的，当明日香递给他水时，他一口气连喝了四口，把整瓶水都喝光了。

Sitting down on the couch beside him, Asuka checked his forehead, but it was fine.

坐在他旁边的沙发上，明日香检查了他的额头，但一切正常。

"What happened?" she asked.

“发生了什么？”她问道。

"...I." “……我。”

But Shinji didn't get any further. Slumping sideways, he fell directly onto Asuka's lap, landing with a thud. Asuka almost jumped up in her surprise, but controlled herself. The nervousness and uncertainty had vanished from her heart, and all that was left was concern for Shinji. She checked his breathing, and it wasn't labored, so it appeared that he was just sleeping for now. She hadn't seen Shinji in this much pain since he broke his leg. Even if he had gotten an injury in some way, it should have healed automatically, so this was something else.

但真嗣没能再说下去。他侧身一倒，直接摔在了明日香的腿上，发出一声闷响。明日香几乎惊跳起来，但还是控制住了自己。心中的紧张和不确定感已消失无踪，只剩下对真嗣的关切。她检查了他的呼吸，并不急促，看来他只是暂时睡着了。自从真嗣摔断腿以来，她还没见过他如此痛苦。即便他受了什么伤，也应该会自动愈合，所以这显然是别的原因。

'Did he have a vision?' wondered Asuka. If this was true, then it could explain his deathly paleness and the apparent pain in his head.

'他是不是看到了什么预兆？' 明日香猜测。如果真是这样，那就能解释他惨白的脸色和明显的头痛了。

Asuka had begun to worry, since it had been hours since Shinji had left, but when he got back, she had grown even more worried. She had been thinking how to greet him when he got back, but this was all replaced by concern for him.

明日香开始担心，因为真嗣已经离开好几个小时了，但当他回来时，她的担忧更甚。她原本在想如何迎接他归来，但此刻所有的念头都被对他的关切所取代。

Glancing down at his face, she realized how close they were again. Though she was still concerned, Asuka felt that the worst was likely over at least. Placing a hand on his head, she stroked his hair softly, running her finger through it, and then running the palm of her hand against his cheek. Leaning down close to him, she carefully wrapped her arms around him, and hugged him gently.

她低头看着他的脸，意识到他们又靠得如此之近。尽管她仍心存忧虑，但至少最糟糕的时刻可能已经过去。她将手放在他的头上，轻柔地抚摸着他的头发，用手指穿梭其中，然后用掌心轻触他的脸颊。她俯身靠近他，小心翼翼地用双臂环抱住他，温柔地拥抱着。

"I'm glad you're back," mumbled Asuka.

“很高兴你回来了，”明日香喃喃道。

Shinji's dreams were muddled and confused. It felt like each dream led into the next, but none of the dreams themselves made any sense. If he pieced them all together, he may have been able to discover something, but before this was able to happen, he woke up.

真嗣的梦境混乱而迷茫。感觉每个梦都连着下一个，但没有一个梦本身有任何意义。如果他能将它们全部拼凑起来，或许能发现些什么，但在此之前，他醒了过来。

He was still resting his head on Asuka's lap, and his eyes were directed towards the fireplace. Turning his head around, he saw Asuka looking down at him.

他依旧将头枕在明日香的膝上，目光投向壁炉。转过头，他看到明日香正低头看着他。

"Finally awake huh?" smiled Asuka.

“终于醒了啊？”明日香微笑道。

The splitting headache was gone, and so Shinji made to sit up, but Asuka rested her hand on his head, signaling for him to continue laying there for a while longer. She had a book in her hand, which she now placed on the table beside the couch.

剧烈的头痛已然消退，于是真嗣准备坐起身来，但明日香将手轻轻搭在他的头上，示意他继续躺一会儿。她手中拿着一本书，此刻将其搁在了沙发旁的桌子上。

"How long was I out?" asked Shinji.

“我昏迷了多久？”真嗣问道。

"Only about an hour I think," replied Asuka. "You really scared me for a moment there when you came back."

“我想大概只有一个小时吧，”明日香回答道，“你回来的时候真的吓了我一跳。”

Shinji didn't say anything, but continued staring up at her. Asuka felt herself blush slightly, and forced herself to look away from him. Though she had been reading, she was often distracted by running her hands through Shinji's hair. Since he had been asleep like that, she took advantage of the opportunity and enjoyed the short time that he had been asleep. Now that he was awake, she was more aware of the position that he was laying in.

真嗣没有说话，只是继续抬头望着她。明日香感到自己的脸颊微微泛红，强迫自己移开视线。虽然她在看书，但常常分心抚摸真嗣的头发。既然他一直那样睡着，她便趁机享受了他短暂的睡眠时光。现在他醒了，她更意识到他躺着的位置。

Shinji decided that he felt well enough however, so he slowly rose from Asuka's lap, and then sank into the cushions beside her. Rubbing the tiredness out of his eyes, he tilted his head back and gazed up at the ceiling.

碇真嗣觉得自己的状态还不错，于是他缓缓从明日香的膝上起身，随后陷入了她身旁的软垫中。他揉了揉困倦的双眼，仰头凝视着天花板。

"Did you have another vision?" asked Asuka eventually.

"你又做梦了吗？" 明日香最终问道。

Shinji didn't say anything, but after several seconds, he nodded once.

真嗣没有说话，但几秒钟后，他轻轻地点了点头。

"Do you want to talk about it?"

"你想谈谈吗？"

"...I don't know whether I can or not. Everything happened so fast that I only got glimpses of things. It all feels like a dream now, but I at least remember several key points.

"...我不知道我能不能做到。一切发生得太快，我只能瞥见一些片段。现在这一切感觉像是一场梦，但我至少记得几个关键点。

So Shinji told Asuka in detail everything he had remembered while leaving out a couple images. He didn't feel comfortable talking about the vision of them kissing in bed however, and this was the main thing that he left out. When he got towards the end of the lengthy vision though, he found himself struggling to explain what he had seen. Faceless people and millions of voices all collaborating in some way was the best that he could describe. As for what had caused him so much pain, he wasn't even sure what it was, since he hadn't in truth seen it, only able to grasp the feeling. Whatever it was couldn't be considered good though.

于是，真嗣向明日香详细讲述了他在幻象中记得的一切，但略去了几个画面。他觉得谈论他们在床上接吻的幻象很不自在，这是他主要省略的部分。当他讲到幻象的尾声时，他发现自己很难解释他所看到的东西。他只能描述为无数无面之人以及千万种声音在某种程度上协作。至于让他感到如此痛苦的原因，他甚至不确定是什么，因为他实际上并没有看到，只能抓住那种感觉。无论如何，那东西绝不是什么好兆头。

After explaining everything, Asuka sat silently in thought. She didn't know what to make of the voices that Shinji had heard, but she was happy about the things he had described that could possibly happen between them. Asuka even went so far as to guess that the things he had seen between them would eventually come to pass, given enough time of course. As for whatever he had seen that had caused him so much pain, Asuka didn't want to dwell on such things.

在解释完一切后，明日香静静地坐着沉思。她不知道该如何理解真嗣听到的那些声音，但她对真嗣描述的他们之间可能发生的事情感到高兴。明日香甚至大胆猜测，他看到的那些情景最终会成真，当然需要足够的时间。至于他看到的那些让他如此痛苦的事情，明日香不想深究。

"So, what do you think?" asked Shinji, giving Asuka enough time to think.

“那么，你怎么想？”真嗣问道，给了明日香足够的时间思考。

"I'm not sure on the whole I suppose. The voices and things are too vague to make heads or tails of. As for some of the other stuff," shrugging Asuka finished with, "I wouldn't mind some of those things actually happening, though having forward knowledge doesn't make it as unique."

"我不确定整体上是怎么回事。那些声音和事情太模糊了，搞不清楚头绪。至于其他一些事情，" 明日香耸耸肩结束道，"我倒不介意那些事情真的发生，只是提前知道就没那么特别了。"

Shinji wondered if she would have said the same thing if he had mentioned them kissing in bed together. Well, either way, on the whole, Shinji felt better about it. Just speaking to Asuka about it helped put his mind at ease.

真嗣想知道如果他提到他们在床上接吻的事，她会不会也这么说。不过，无论如何，总的来说，真嗣感觉好多了。只是和明日香谈论这件事就让他心情放松了不少。

"You hungry?" asked Asuka suddenly.

"你饿了吗？" 明日香突然问道。

Shinji was, not realizing it until now. Nodding, Asuka stood up and said she'd make him something, though it wouldn't be much. Even if it wasn't much, it was enough for Shinji.

真嗣直到此刻才意识到这一点。点头后，明日香站起身来说要给他做点什么，虽然不会很多。即便不多，对真嗣来说已经足够了。

Later, Asuka brought him a plate, while she nibbled on a few things herself. She wasn't very hungry, but she wanted something to take her mind off things for a couple minutes at least. Now that Shinji was awake, she was wondering if things would return to how they were earlier in the morning.

后来，明日香端给他一盘食物，自己也吃了几口。她并不怎么饿，只是想找点事情让自己的思绪暂时摆脱烦恼。现在真嗣醒了，她不禁思考事情是否会回到今早之前的状态。

This didn't seem to be case though, as after Shinji had finished eat, he slowly scooted closer to Asuka, resting against her side. It was nice to see Shinji taking some sort of initiative for a change, since it had been her who was doing everything recently. But this was also a problem, since Asuka was becoming aware of how hot Shinji's body was leaning against her. Had he always been this warm, or were her hormones just acting up again?

然而，情况似乎并非如此，因为真嗣吃完后，慢慢地挪近明日香，靠在她身边。看到真嗣终于主动了一次，这感觉不错，毕竟最近都是她在忙前忙后。但这也有问题，因为明日香开始意识到真嗣的身体靠在她身上有多热。他一直这么温暖吗，还是她的荷尔蒙又在作祟？

"Asuka...thanks..." mumbled Shinji.

"明日香...谢谢..." 真嗣喃喃道。

Stealing a glance over at him, Asuka asked, "What for?"

偷瞄了他一眼，明日香问道：“为什么？”

"For lunch as a start, though more importantly, for listening to me. This is the first time my visions have been so jumbled, so I was a little unnerved I think."

“先是为了午餐，但更重要的是，为了听我倾诉。我的预感从未如此混乱过，所以我觉得有点不安。”

"Idiot," sighed Asuka, placing a hand on his head.

“笨蛋，”明日香叹了口气，把手放在他的头上。

Shinji smirked as she did this, and Asuka raised an eyebrow at him, almost daring him to do something. Predictably, Shinji broke eye contact with her first, and Asuka sighed inwardly. Removing her hand from Shinji's head, she intended to go back to reading, when she felt something soft brushing against her cheek. Darting her eyes back towards Shinji, she instinctively placed her hands over the spot where he had just kissed her. Asuka honestly didn't know what to make of this, as it had come out of left field, but it seemed that Shinji was just showing his appreciation towards her. Asuka didn't even feel embarrassed, and it seemed that Shinji was the same.

真嗣对此微微一笑，明日香则挑起眉毛看着他，几乎是在挑衅他做点什么。不出所料，真嗣首先避开了她的目光，明日香在心里叹了口气。她把手从真嗣的头上移开，打算继续阅读，这时她感觉到有什么柔软的东西轻拂过她的脸颊。她迅速将目光转向真嗣，本能地用手捂住了他刚刚亲吻过的地方。明日香真的不知道该如何理解这一举动，因为它来得毫无预兆，但似乎真嗣只是在表达对她的感激之情。明日香甚至没有感到尴尬，而真嗣似乎也是如此。

A wave of feelings washed over Asuka, and she wondered if she should reply in turn, though things could get messy quickly. In the end, she settled with shooting Shinji a seductive gaze. This time, Shinji did turn red, and started coughing suddenly. Asuka had to fight back a laugh, but it eventually broke through her lips. They were acting like children, but Asuka didn't care how dumb it seemed; she was having fun afterall.

一股情感涌上明日香的心头，她不知道是否应该回应，尽管事情可能会很快变得复杂。最终，她决定用一个诱人的眼神回敬真嗣。这次，真嗣的脸真的红了，突然开始咳嗽。明日香不得不强忍住笑意，但最终还是笑了出来。他们的行为就像孩子一样，但明日香不在乎这看起来有多傻；毕竟，她玩得很开心。

Controlling his coughing fit with a swig of water, Shinji looked over at Asuka and said, "You didn't have to start laughing."

强忍着咳嗽，喝了一口水，真嗣转头看向明日香，说道：“你没必要笑出声的。”

"Sorry, couldn't help myself."

“抱歉，没忍住。”

The mood was the lightest it had ever been after skin to lip contact, and Asuka felt that this was an improvement in its own right. Maybe they had gotten passed that part? Asuka was happy that they could calmly communicate with each other. Every other time, a kiss had happened directly before bed, without leaving much room to talk, and in the morning it was a voided subject. If they were able to do this then-

肌肤相触后，气氛变得前所未有的轻松，明日香觉得这本身就是一种进步。或许他们已经度过了那个阶段？明日香很高兴他们能够平静地交流。以往每次，亲吻总是在睡前直接发生，几乎没有留下交谈的空间，而早晨则避而不谈。如果他们能做到这一点——

"...Hey Asuka?" asked Shinji, pulling Asuka out of her train of thought.

"...嘿，明日香？" 真嗣问道，将明日香从思绪中拉回。

"Hmm, what is it?" "嗯，什么事？"

"Do you want to kiss?"

"你想接吻吗？"

Asuka dropped her plate in surprise, where it made a loud thud on the carpet, an assortment of food falling onto the carpet, but Asuka didn't even notice. Slowly, she turned her eyes towards Shinji. He was looking directly at her, any sense of nervousness hidden behind his passive face. Asuka didn't think that her face was the same, and felt that her cheeks were steadily heating up. He had said something completely unreasonable and unexpected. Asuka didn't know how to reply, and felt like a fish helpless on land as she opened her mouth and then closed it slowly.

明日香惊讶地失手让盘子掉落，砸在厚厚的地毯上发出一声闷响，各种食物散落在地毯上，但她却浑然不觉。她缓缓将目光转向真嗣。他正直视着她，脸上的紧张感被平静的表情所掩盖。明日香不认为自己的表情也是如此，只觉得双颊在不断升温。他说了些完全不合常理又出乎意料的话。明日香不知该如何回应，张了张嘴又慢慢合上，感觉自己像是一条无助地躺在陆地上的鱼。

"I'm sorry if I asked it too suddenly, but-"

“如果我突然这么问让你感到困扰，我很抱歉，但是——”

Shinji's words were cut off though, since Asuka tackled him from the opposite end of the couch. Pinning him down, she towered over him, sitting on his waist. Shinji tried to ignore the softness of her thighs grinding against him, but this proved impossible. Surely Asuka knew this as well, but she didn't seem to care about this detail.

然而，真嗣的话还没说完，就被从沙发另一端扑过来的明日香打断了。她将他按倒，骑坐在他的腰上，居高临下地俯视着他。真嗣试图忽视她大腿压在他身上的柔软触感，但这显然是不可能的。明日香肯定也知道这一点，但她似乎并不在意这个小细节。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji hesitantly.

"绫波？" 真嗣犹豫地问道。

"...What?" Asuka replied slowly.

"...什么？" 绫波缓缓回答。

"You haven't answered me."

"你还没回答我。"

Though Asuka was the one in charge currently, she didn't feel like she was able to reply. The words were stuck in her throat, and try as she might, two simple words couldn't escape her lips.

虽然目前是明日香在负责，但她感觉自己无法回应。话语卡在喉咙里，尽管她努力尝试，那两个简单的词却无法从唇间逃出。

"You can say no if you aren't ready as well," mumbled Shinji. "I don't know if I am myself...but I feel that we've been dancing around this for a while."

"如果你还没准备好，也可以拒绝，" 真嗣咕哝道，"我自己也不知道是否准备好了...但我觉得我们已经在这件事上兜圈子很久了。"

"Shinji, I..." "真嗣，我..."

Quick as a flash, there positions were reversed, as Shinji rose up and grabbed Asuka by the shoulders, pinning her down on the couch. Now that Asuka was being pinned, she felt a certain fieriness rising up within her. Her hormones started raging inside of her, and her emotions were running wild. How could Shinji be so calm right now, or was he just feigning it? If Asuka only told him it was okay, then it'd be over quickly, but she knew that unless she said it, Shinji wouldn't dare do it. Shinji cared to much about her to force her into something that she may be uncomfortable with.

迅如闪电，局势瞬间逆转，真嗣起身抓住明日香的肩膀，将她按倒在沙发上。如今被压制住的明日香，内心燃起一股炽热。她的荷尔蒙在体内狂飙，情绪也变得狂野。真嗣此刻怎能如此冷静，还是他只是在假装？如果明日香只告诉他没关系，那么一切会很快结束，但她知道，除非她说出口，否则真嗣绝不敢贸然行事。真嗣太过在乎她，不愿强迫她做任何可能让她感到不适的事情。

But Asuka wasn't uncomfortable with it.

但明日香对此并不感到不适。

Though still unable to find her voice, Asuka reached up towards Shinji, and drew him towards him. Not expecting this sudden move by her, Shinji was pulled into Asuka's embrace so that their bodies were parallel with each other. The soft flesh of Asuka's body was almost too much for Shinji, that he tried untangling himself from her arms, but Asuka's grip was too strong. She had wrapped her arms around his back, and firmly held them there.

尽管仍无法发出声音，明日香伸出手向真嗣靠近，将他拉向自己。未料到她这突如其来的举动，真嗣被拉入明日香的怀抱，两人的身体平行相贴。明日香柔软的身躯几乎让真嗣难以承受，他试图从她的臂弯中挣脱，但明日香的握力太强。她已将双臂环绕在他的背后，牢牢地固定在那里。

Since their faces were parallel, Shinji was able to see the many emotions that were racing across Asuka's face. She was embarrassed, nervous, appeared slightly afraid, but also seemed prepared for whatever happened afterwards. But unless she said something, Shinji wouldn't kiss her.

由于他们的脸平行相对，真嗣得以看清绫波脸上掠过的种种情绪。她显得尴尬、紧张，略带一丝恐惧，却又似乎对接下来可能发生的一切做好了准备。但除非她主动开口，否则真嗣不会吻她。

Asuka understood this though.

明日香明白这一点。

Drawing even closer to him, Asuka rested her chin in the gap of his collarbone, nuzzling her face against him. Shinji weight was pressing down on her, but she didn't care. Running her hand along his back, her fingernails carefully clawed at the fabric of his shoulder, tracing lines over his back muscles. Shinji inhaled rather suddenly as she did this, not expecting this sort of sensation by just having Asuka's hands gliding across his back.

阿斯卡更加靠近他，将下巴搁在他锁骨的缝隙中，脸颊紧贴着他。真嗣的体重压在她身上，但她并不介意。她用手沿着他的背部滑动，指甲小心翼翼地抓挠着他肩上的布料，勾勒着他背部肌肉的线条。真嗣突然深吸了一口气，没想到仅仅是阿斯卡的手在他背上滑过就能带来这样的感觉。

"Asuka, this is..." “阿斯卡，这……”

Asuka stopped what she was doing, and drew back slightly so that she could look directly into Shinji's eyes.

阿斯卡停下了手中的动作，微微后退以便能直接注视着真嗣的眼睛。

"I can stop if you want."

"如果你愿意，我可以停下来。"

"That isn't the point here. You still haven't answered me."

"问题不在这里。你还是没有回答我。"

Asuka bit her lips in frustration, still unable to give him an answer.

明日香懊恼地咬着嘴唇，依旧无法给他一个答案。

"If thats how its going to be, then I'm getting up," said Shinji as he managed to remove her arms from his back. Asuka hadn't even noticed he was struggling until he was already sitting up.

"既然这样，那我就起来了，" 真嗣说着，设法挣脱了她环在他背后的手臂。明日香直到他坐起来才意识到他在挣扎。

"Shinji...wait..." Asuka mumbled, reaching out for his hand, but Shinji shook her hand off. Walking to the front of the house, he opened the front door, and then walked outside. Asuka followed him up the circular driveway, but she found that she couldn't continue. She had been making excuses the whole way, each seeming more feeble than the last.

"真嗣...等等..." 明日香喃喃道，伸手去抓他的手，但真嗣甩开了她的手。他走到房子前面，打开前门，然后走了出去。明日香跟着他走上环形车道，但她发现自己无法继续前行。她一路上一直在找借口，每一个都比上一个更无力。

'Just tell him damn it!' Asuka told herself. 'Tell him that you want him to kiss you! Tell him how much you lo-'

'快告诉他，该死的！' 明日香对自己说。'告诉他你想让他吻你！告诉他你有多爱他-'

But Shinji walked down the road without looking back, and Asuka didn't say anything.

但真嗣沿着路走下去，没有回头，而明日香什么也没说。

Slowly, she walked back inside in a daze of sorts. It was hard to comprehend why she hadn't just told him. For all Asuka's determination, and the steps that she had taken for a while now, the thought of kissing Shinji still made her pause. Their relationship wasn't what it had once been. It had certainly changed, and both were aware of this. For Asuka, kissing Shinji meant something entirely different though; she was basically telling her feelings to him in one motion. If she didn't feel that way, then she couldn't have wanted to kiss him. But she was still nervous about it.

她慢慢地走回屋内，有些恍惚。很难理解为什么她没有直接告诉他。尽管明日香决心坚定，并且已经为此努力了一段时间，但想到亲吻真嗣仍然让她犹豫。他们的关系已经不再是过去的样子了。确实发生了变化，两人都心知肚明。但对明日香来说，亲吻真嗣意味着完全不同的事情；这几乎是在一次动作中向他表达自己的感情。如果她没有那种感觉，那么她就不会想要吻他。但她对此仍然感到紧张。

Shinji didn't know where he was walking, or why he was walking. Sometimes thats all it seemed like he was doing lately, going from one place to another without any clear destination in mind. They had found another house, but so what? It didn't matter if they weren't able to get passed their own problems.

真嗣不知道自己在往哪里走，也不知道为什么要走。最近，他似乎只是在从一个地方走到另一个地方，没有任何明确的目的地。他们找到了另一所房子，但那又怎样？如果他们无法解决自己的问题，这一切都无关紧要。

Thinking back on what had happened, Shinji was beginning to wonder if he shouldn't have just kissed Asuka anyway. He was nearly one hundred percent sure that she wanted to experience it, but Shinji wanted to hear it from her own lips before he sealed them.

回想起发生的事情，真嗣开始怀疑自己是否应该直接吻了明日香。他几乎百分百确定她想要体验那个吻，但真嗣希望在封缄她的双唇之前，能亲耳听到她的心声。

He was currently sitting on the steps of the house they had been to at the far end of the road with the swimming pool. There was a large wooded area behind the house, though Shinji didn't feel like walking any further than this. He didn't even bother to try the front door, but just continued sitting out here.

他现在正坐在那条路尽头带游泳池的房子前的台阶上。房子后面是一大片树林，但真嗣觉得没必要再走得更远了。他甚至没费心去试前门，只是继续坐在这里。

He didn't know how much time had passed, but during that time, the clouds had steadily built up and small droplets of rain began falling. Deciding that he should return before the downpour starting, he walked back up the road halfheartedly, wondering how things would be back home with Asuka.

他不知道时间过去了多久，但在这段时间里，云层逐渐堆积，细小的雨滴开始落下。他决定在暴雨来临前返回，于是心不在焉地沿着道路走回去，思索着家里与明日香的情况会如何。

Rounding the corner, he saw something which he hadn't expected. Off to the side of the road was Asuka, leaning against a large tree. She was wearing a sweatshirt with the hood drawn up over her head, and her hands were tucked into the pocket of her jeans. She was looking down at the ground, and seemed to be fidgeting, or debating might be more accurate.

转过街角，他看到了一个出乎意料的景象。路边不远处，明日香正倚靠在一棵大树旁。她穿着一件连帽衫，帽子拉起遮住了头，双手插在牛仔裤口袋里。她低头看着地面，似乎在不安地摆弄着什么，或者用“犹豫不决”来形容更为贴切。

"Asuka, what are you doing here?"

"明日香，你在这里做什么？"

"Do you even need to ask that?" she said as she looked up towards him.

"这还需要问吗？" 她抬头看向他，说道。"

"How long have you been waiting here?"

"你在这里等了多久？"

"Not long. Once I saw the clouds gathering, I decided to come and get you, though I got sorta sidetracked halfway. I knew you hadn't come back this way yet, so I figured you were still down the road somewhere."

"不久前，看到云层聚集，我就决定来找你，不过中途有点分心了。我知道你还没从这条路回来，所以猜你还在路上某处。"

Asuka's cheeks were turning pink thanks to the drop in temperature, but she didn't seem upset over what had happened earlier. Shinji was surprised she could be so calm, but when she walked up to him, grabbed his hand, he could feel the tension in her grip.

由于气温下降，明日香的脸颊泛起了红晕，但她似乎并未因之前的事而生气。这让真嗣感到惊讶，她竟能如此平静。但当她走近他，握住他的手时，他能感受到她紧握中的紧张。

"C'mon, lets go back before the rain starts coming down even harder."

"快点，我们回去吧，免得雨下得更大。"

"...Yeah," said Shinji rather offhandedly.

"...嗯，" 真嗣有些漫不经心地说。

"...Something wrong?" asked Asuka.

"...有什么不对劲吗？" 明日香问道。

Shinji didn't say anything, unsure whether everything was fine, or if nothing was alright.

真嗣没有说话，不确定一切是否还好，或者是否一切都出了问题。

They made it back to their house just and the sky opened up, and the downpour happened. Shinji had gotten slightly more wet than Asuka, so he went upstairs to change out of his clothes. When he came back down, Asuka already had a cup of tea waiting for him, and another already for herself. Shinji was unsure whether he should sit down next to her, but Asuka didn't give any indication that this would bother her, so Shinji did so.

他们刚回到家中，天空便骤然放晴，紧接着大雨倾盆而下。真嗣比明日香稍微湿了些，于是他上楼去换衣服。当他下楼时，明日香已经为他准备了一杯茶，自己也端着一杯。真嗣犹豫着是否该坐在她旁边，但明日香并未表现出任何介意，于是真嗣便坐下了。

Shinji felt awkward sitting next to her, knowing what had transpired not long ago. Asuka was reading a book, and seemed to be ignoring the stifled silence between them, but Shinji couldn't take it anymore.

真嗣坐在她旁边感到有些尴尬，毕竟不久前才发生了那件事。明日香正在读一本书，看似无视着两人间压抑的沉默，但真嗣再也忍受不了了。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

In response, Asuka closed her book suddenly, and then turned towards him.

闻言，明日香突然合上了书，然后转向他。

"What?" “什么？”

"About earlier..." “关于之前的事……”

"Do you really need to hear it from me?" mumbled Asuka softly.

“你真的需要听我说吗？”明日香轻声咕哝道。

"Like I said, if you don't say it, I wont."

"就像我说的，如果你不说，我也不会。"

"You're being stubborn." "你真是固执。"

"How can you say that with a straight face?"

"你怎么能面不改色地说出这种话？"

Asuka stuck out her tongue playfully at him, but then sighed and said, "Well, its not like I don't know anyway. I'm not stupid."

明日香俏皮地对他吐了吐舌头，随即叹了口气说：“好吧，反正我也知道。我又不是傻瓜。”

"...Huh?" stuttered Shinji.

“……啊？”真嗣结巴道。

Asuka grinned, and took his hand, intertwining his fingers in hers. Pressing his hand against her forehead, she inexplicably brought Shinji closer to her. Shinji wasn't sure what she was doing, but it almost looked like she was praying in a strange manner. Her eyes were closed, and her eyelashes were fluttering softly, the warmth from the fireplace dying one side of her face a brilliant color.

明日香咧嘴一笑，握住他的手，将他的手指与她的交缠在一起。她将他的手按在自己的额头上，神秘地将真嗣拉近自己。真嗣不确定她在做什么，但这看起来几乎像是在以一种奇怪的方式祈祷。她的眼睛闭着，睫毛轻轻颤动，壁炉的温暖让她的脸颊一侧染上了绚丽的色彩。

Opening her eyes, she looked over at Shinji and said-

睁开眼睛，她看向真嗣，说道——

"Hold still for a moment."

“别动，就一会儿。”

Shinji blinked once, aware that Asuka had moved closer to him. Her right hand was still holding onto his right, and he noticed that his palm was starting to sweat. He wondered if Asuka would notice this, but she seemed too busy focusing on something else at the moment. Was there something on his face? Why did she seemed nervous?

真嗣眨了一下眼，意识到明日香已经向他靠近。她的右手仍然握着他的右手，他注意到自己的手掌开始出汗。他不知道明日香是否会注意到这一点，但她此刻似乎正专注于其他事情。他的脸上有什么东西吗？为什么她看起来很紧张？

Then it clicked, and Shinji realized what Asuka was doing. He had half a second to determine whether to break free of her grasp, or not. But Asuka broke in with-

就在这一刻，一切豁然开朗，真嗣明白了明日香在做什么。他只有半秒钟的时间决定是否挣脱她的束缚，还是任由她继续。但明日香抢先一步——

"If you dare try to break free, I swear I'll hit you."

"你要是敢试图挣脱，我发誓我会揍你。"

Shinji couldn't believe she could be this easygoing in this situation. Where had all her nervousness gone, or was she just that determined now?

真嗣无法相信她在这个情况下还能如此轻松。她所有的紧张感都去哪儿了，还是说她现在就是那么坚定？

Shinji could now count each individual eyelash of hers as she drew nearer. Her bright eyes felt like they were piercing directly into his soul, locking him into position so he couldn't move. They were captivating, and Shinji found that he couldn't looked away, let alone move, if he wanted to. It seemed that he was resigning himself to what was happening, and even began to long for it. But as Asuka leaned into him, her body pressing against his while their hands were still clasped together, she paused. Shinji could feel her breathe on his face, filling his nostrils, but it was her eyes that he was drawn to. Even though on the exterior, she seemed fine, her eyes gave a different story. She was obviously worried, and her eyes had even started to water slightly. As Shinji waited though, he was starting to lose all self control.

随着她越来越近，真嗣现在能数清她每一根睫毛。她明亮的眼睛仿佛直接穿透了他的灵魂，将他固定在原地无法动弹。它们如此迷人，真嗣发现自己无法移开视线，更不用说移动了。他似乎在屈服于正在发生的事情，甚至开始渴望它。但当明日香靠近他，身体紧贴着他，而他们的手仍然紧握在一起时，她停了下来。真嗣能感觉到她的呼吸拂过他的脸庞，充满他的鼻腔，但吸引他的是她的眼睛。尽管外表看起来她没事，但她的眼睛透露出不同的故事。她显然很担心，眼睛甚至开始微微泛泪。尽管如此，真嗣等待着，他开始失去所有的自制力。

'If you aren't going to kiss me, I may just break down and close this small gap,' thought Shinji.

"如果你不打算吻我，我可能就要崩溃，然后把这个小小的距离也关上了，" 真嗣心想。

Gripping tightly to her hand, Shinji tried to give her some sort of reassurance. Feeling her hand being griped tightly, Asuka squeezed back slightly, and then gave him a small smile. Cupping his face with her other hand, she leaned in, closed her eyes, and gently pressed her lips against his.

紧紧握住她的手，真嗣试图给她一些安慰。感受到手被紧紧握住，明日香轻轻回握了一下，然后向他露出了一个浅浅的微笑。她用另一只手托住他的脸颊，倾身向前，闭上眼睛，温柔地将自己的唇贴上了他的。

This happened for maybe a fraction of a second, before Asuka broke off the contact. It had come and gone with hardly anytime passing between them, and they both sat facing each other for what felt like an eternity, when Shinji finally said.

这一刻或许只持续了刹那，随后明日香便中断了接触。它来去匆匆，几乎未曾在他们之间留下痕迹，两人相对而坐，仿佛度过了一个永恒，直到真嗣终于开口。

"That felt-" "那感觉——"

"-Awkward," finished Asuka.

"——挺尴尬的，" 明日香接话道。

It wasn't awkward because their feelings weren't strong enough, but because it was both of their first kisses. You couldn't blame then for not knowing much on the subject, since it was something neither had thought about during these fifteen years of their lives.

这尴尬并非因为他们的感情不够强烈，而是因为这是两人的初吻。你不能怪他们对此知之甚少，毕竟这是十五年来他们从未考虑过的事情。

'That wasn't so bad,' thought Asuka. 'Though I don't see what the big deal is either now that I've done it. Is something supposed to be different?'

“那也没那么糟糕，”明日香心想，“虽然我现在做了也没觉得有什么大不了的。应该有什么不同吗？”

"Hey Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"...Yeah?" "...嗯？"

"...One more time." “……再来一次。”

Asuka closed the distance much faster this time, and without much hesitance. Quickly, she pressed her own lips against Shinji's, but didn't admittedly feel anything different. Again, this was done quickly, and was hardly more than a peck.

这次明日香缩短距离快得多，几乎没有犹豫。她迅速将自己的嘴唇贴在真嗣的唇上，但确实没感觉到有什么不同。这一次同样很快，几乎只是一个轻吻。

"One more time," she mumbled.

“再来一次。”她喃喃道。

Locking her lips to his, Asuka finally found what she was searching for. Shinji had been suppressing himself for a while now, trying to contain his desires that were rushing through him, but after being kissed by Asuka twice now, he gave up on suppressing himself.

将双唇紧贴于他的唇上，明日香终于找到了她一直在寻找的东西。真嗣已经压抑自己一段时间了，试图控制那些在他体内汹涌的欲望，但在被明日香吻了两次之后，他放弃了压抑自己。

Raising his hand up, he pressed it against Asuka's cheek, stroking it gently, while he kissed her back. This change surprised Asuka, and she drew back for a moment.

他举起手，轻轻地抚摸着明日香的脸颊，同时回吻她。这一变化让明日香感到惊讶，她一时退缩了。

"Shinji wha-" “真嗣，怎——”

But Shinji wasn't done yet. Cutting her off, he leaned forward, and kissed her deeply this time, trying to convey his feelings in this kiss. Shinji had never known anything so strange as he kissed Asuka, slowly pushing her down onto the couch. It was like he was desperately in need of oxygen, and the only way he would survive is if he continued kissing Asuka. Slowly, he felt the surprise melting away from her, being replaced by what could only be described as greed. Asuka greedily kissed him back, sucking him towards her. Both forgot to breath for a moment, and Asuka's hands raked their way along his back, clawing his skin. Shinji winced briefly at this, but the pleasure and ecstasy he was feeling by kissing Asuka was similar to a narcotic so that he forgot pain for a while.

但真嗣还未结束。他打断她，倾身向前，这次深深地吻了她，试图通过这个吻传达他的情感。真嗣从未经历过如此奇异的事，他缓缓将明日香推倒在沙发上，亲吻着她。仿佛他极度渴望氧气，而唯一能让他活下去的方式就是继续亲吻明日香。渐渐地，他感觉到她的惊讶消融，取而代之的是一种只能被形容为贪婪的情绪。明日香贪婪地回吻他，将他吸向自己。两人一时忘记了呼吸，明日香的手沿着他的背脊划过，抓挠着他的皮肤。真嗣为此微微皱眉，但亲吻明日香带来的愉悦与狂喜犹如麻醉剂，让他暂时忘却了疼痛。

He did have to breathe eventually though, and letting up for air, he was given about two seconds before Asuka brought him back towards her. Now that she had gotten used to this, she didn't want to stop. Asuka's body was beginning to throb, and she became aware of certain pleasantries weaving around her body. A surge of electricity went through her, and she arched her back, grinding her hips against Shinji's.

尽管他终究需要呼吸，但在喘息之际，他只得到了大约两秒的喘息时间，就被明日香再次拉向自己。如今她已习惯了这种感觉，便不愿停下。明日香的身躯开始悸动，她察觉到某种愉悦感正缠绕周身。一股电流般的快感涌遍全身，她挺直了背脊，将臀部紧贴着真嗣磨蹭。

Breaking off the kiss, she was panting heavily, and her entire body was sweating profusely. Shinji's was as well, though he leaned back in to kiss her, but Asuka pressed a finger of hers against his lips.

她喘息着中断了这个吻，全身大汗淋漓。真嗣也是如此，尽管他再次倾身想要吻她，但明日香用一根手指按住了他的唇。

"Hang on," panted Asuka. "Give me a minute."

“等一下，”明日香喘着气说，“让我缓一缓。”

"Tired?" asked Shinji. "累了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"I forgot how to breathe there for a minute, so I'm feeling incredibly lightheaded, though I suppose thats not the only reason."

“我刚才忘了怎么呼吸，所以现在感觉非常头晕，虽然我想这并不是唯一的原因。”

Still panting deeply, Asuka wiped some sweat of her forehead, and then looked over to the fireplace. It felt like hours had passed since they had kissed, but it had been only a matter of seconds. Asuka's hunger for Shinji was almost insatiable it seemed.

仍然喘着粗气，明日香擦去额头上的汗水，然后望向壁炉。感觉像是过了好几个小时，其实他们接吻才不过几秒钟。明日香对真嗣的渴望似乎无法满足。

'I want to continue, but I'm also afraid what could happen if we continue.'

'我想继续，但又害怕如果我们继续会发生什么。'

It didn't seem like she had to worry about this, because Shinji suddenly got off the couch, and walked outside. Asuka sat up, bewildered that he had gotten up in the middle of this, but she followed him anyway.

看起来她不必担心这个，因为真嗣突然从沙发上站起来，走了出去。明日香坐起身，困惑于他为何在这中途起身，但她还是跟了上去。

Shinji was standing in the rain, letting it splash onto his forehead.

真嗣站在雨中，任由雨水溅落在他的额头上。

"What are you doing just standing there?" asked Asuka from the comfort of the sliding glass door.

“你站在那儿干嘛呢？”明日香从滑动玻璃门的舒适处问道。

"Trying to calm myself," mumbled Shinji. "That was far more exhilarating than I had imagined...kissing you, that is."

"试图让自己冷静下来，" 真嗣喃喃道，"那比我想象的要刺激得多……亲吻你，就是指这个。"

Asuka felt her face heat up as Shinji mentioned what had just transpired, but if anything, she just wanted to kiss him again.

听到真嗣提及刚刚发生的事，明日香感到脸颊发烫，但不知为何，她只想再次吻他。

"Well, its getting dark, so now is probably a good time to start dinner."

“嗯，天色渐暗，现在大概是开始做晚饭的好时机。”

Asuka felt her jaw drop, amazed that Shinji could mention dinner so casually. They'd just kissed each other for the first time afterall, and now Shinji was acting as though it was a one time thing.

明日香惊讶得下巴都快掉下来了，真嗣居然能如此随意地提到晚餐。毕竟他们刚刚才第一次接吻，而真嗣现在表现得好像那只是一次性的举动。

"Whats wrong?" asked Shinji, seeing the slight from on her face.

“怎么了？”真嗣问道，注意到她脸上的些许不悦。

"Can't we wait a little longer...I want to continue..."

“我们不能再等一会儿吗……我想继续……”

Shinji thought Asuka far too cute when she said, and came close to accepting her offer. If he did, they may not have dinner till almost nine though. Shinji would have liked nothing better than to return to the couch, or better yet, the bed, and continue where they left off, but he felt that taking a break like this was good also. It helped to keep him semi sane at the very least.

真嗣觉得当明日香这么说时，她真是太可爱了，他几乎要接受她的提议。但如果他真的这么做，他们可能要到将近九点才能吃上晚饭。真嗣本想回到沙发上，或者更好的是，回到床上，继续他们未完的事情，但他觉得像这样休息一下也不错。至少这有助于让他保持半分理智。

"Later," mumbled Shinji. "Truthfully, I was forgetting myself for a while there. Sorry if I did something I shouldn't have."

"待会儿见。" 真嗣咕哝道，"说实话，我刚才有点忘乎所以了。如果做了什么不该做的事，对不起。"

"No, you didn't," said Asuka, shaking her head.

"不，你没有。" 明日香摇着头说。"

"Hmm, well thats good at least."

"嗯，那至少是件好事。"

Walking back towards the sliding door, he paused on the step, looking up at Asuka. Smiling, he placed a kiss on her cheek before she had time to ask why he had paused, and then walked passed her. Asuka reflexively placed her hand over the spot, and then stared at Shinji's back as he walked into the kitchen.

他走回滑动门旁，在台阶上停下，抬头望向明日香。他微笑着，在她还没来得及问为什么停下时，就在她的脸颊上轻轻一吻，然后从她身边走过。明日香本能地用手抚摸着被吻的地方，然后盯着真嗣走进厨房的背影。

"Later my ass," mumbled Asuka. "You want it just as much as me."

“晚点个头，”明日香咕哝道，“你和我一样想要。”

Maybe because of what happened, but dinner seemed a much more hurried affair then in recent memory. Asuka helped Shinji, though she more in the way than actually helping. She very clearly wanted dinner to be over with quickly, so they could continue. Shinji took his time well enough, but even he wanted to hurry up and finish. Asuka kept debating whether to kiss him or not as they worked in the kitchen together, and once or twice, she came close, but always decided to wait in the end.

也许是因为发生了那件事，晚餐似乎比最近的记忆中都要匆忙。明日香帮着真嗣，尽管她更多的是碍手碍脚而不是真的帮忙。她显然希望晚餐能快点结束，这样他们就可以继续了。真嗣也尽量放慢速度，但连他也想快点结束。在厨房一起忙碌时，明日香一直在纠结是否要吻他，有一两次她几乎要这么做，但最终还是决定等待。

They didn't say much as they ate, focusing on their own food. Asuka even started playing with her food at one point, her appetite vanishing as her lust began to take over. When she finally couldn't take it anymore, she stood up and placed her half eaten plate by the sink, and then sat down on the couch. Shinji steadily continued eating until he was done, and then began washing the dishes. When he was halfway done, Asuka slowly walked over to him.

他们吃饭时没怎么说话，各自专注于面前的食物。明日香甚至一度开始玩弄起食物来，随着欲望逐渐占据上风，她的食欲也消失了。最终，她再也忍受不住，站起身将吃了一半的盘子放在水槽旁，然后坐到了沙发上。真嗣则稳稳地继续进食，直到吃完后才开始洗碗。当他洗到一半时，明日香缓缓走向了他。

"Can't you do that later?"

“你不能晚点再做吗？”

"I'd rather get it done now, while I'm still thinking straight," sighed Shinji.

"我宁愿现在就完成，趁我脑子还清醒，" 真嗣叹息道。

Asuka frowned, but then wrapped her arms around Shinji's chest, pressing her body against his back. A comfortable feeling washed over her, and Asuka began rocking backwards and forewords slowly.

明日香皱了皱眉，但还是用双臂环抱住真嗣的胸膛，将自己的身体紧贴在他的背上。一种舒适的感觉涌上心头，明日香开始慢慢地前后摇晃。

"Asuka, if you do that, then it'll take even longer to finish this."

"明日香，如果你那样做，那完成这件事的时间会更长。"

"Then don't finish it. One day won't hurt."

“那就别做完。一天不做也没关系。”

As if to convince him that ignoring the dishes was better, she softly began breathing on the back of his neck and ear, making Shinji squirm uncontrollably. Asuka's warm breathe tickled him, nearly convincing him that what she was offering was better...and she was right, but Shinji wanted to get this done. He didn't know what would happen later, but he wanted as few things to deal with incase something did happen.

仿佛是为了说服他忽视洗碗更好，她轻轻地开始对着他的后颈和耳朵呼气，让真嗣不由自主地扭动起来。明日香温暖的呼吸让他发痒，几乎让他相信她所提供的更好……而她的确是对的，但真嗣想把这件事做完。他不知道之后会发生什么，但他希望尽可能少地处理事情，以防万一真的发生了什么。

Finally giving up on her attempts to convince him, Asuka leaned against the counter beside him.

最终放弃了说服他的尝试，明日香靠在了他旁边的柜台上。

"You're no fun," she said.

"你真没趣，"她说。

"You can wait ten more minutes."

"你还可以再等十分钟。

"Hmm, I'm really not sure about that," grinned Asuka playfully.

"嗯，我对此真的不太确定，"明日香调皮地笑着说。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji, trying to focus on the plate he was scrubbing. 'Doesn't she understand that this is difficult for me as well?'

“该死，”真嗣想着，努力专注于他正在擦洗的盘子。“难道她不明白这对我也很难吗？”

Asuka didn't say anything to him afterwards however, and was content to lean against the counter and watch him as he worked. Shinji was thorough every time he washed the dishes, but Asuka thought she sensed a certain urgency in the way he worked the scrub brush. When he finally finished washing the last dish, he dried it off and placed it in the cupboard beside the sink. Letting out a low sigh, he began drying his own hands off, when Asuka spoke.

然而，明日香之后并没有对他说什么，只是靠在柜台上，看着他工作。每次洗碗，真嗣都非常仔细，但明日香觉得她察觉到他在使用刷子时有一种紧迫感。当他终于洗完最后一个盘子，擦干并将其放入水槽旁的橱柜时，他低声叹了口气，开始擦干自己的手，这时明日香开口了。

"All done?" came her voice beside him.

“都洗完了？”她的声音在他身旁响起。

"Yeah, I am. Though I'm not really sure-"

“是的，我是。不过我不太确定——”

Whatever he had been about to say, Asuka didn't give him that chance. Wrapping her arms around his neck, she practically smashed her lips against his, and Shinji felt the chink of his teeth as Asuka's teeth hit them forcefully. Shinji didn't get any time to prepare himself again, and was quickly lost in the moment. Asuka seemed almost feverish as she kissed him, desperate to continue with this passion.

无论他原本要说什么，明日香都没给他机会。她双臂环住他的脖子，几乎是用唇猛撞上他的，真嗣感觉到她的牙齿有力地碰到了他的。真嗣没有时间再次准备，很快便迷失在这一刻。明日香吻得近乎狂热，迫切地想要继续这份激情。

Shinji's hands weren't fully dry yet, and he could only hold them up in the air while they kissed. When Asuka drew back for a breathe, Shinji took the opportunity to wipe his hands on his jeans, and then Asuka was back for more. Hungrily, her lips wrapped around Shinji's, the pleasure coursing through her body being the only thing that she was thinking of.

真嗣的手还没完全干，他只能举在空中，一边接吻。当明日香退开喘口气时，真嗣趁机在牛仔裤上擦了擦手，随即明日香又回来了。她饥渴地吻着真嗣，全身心只感受到那股快感。

Now that his hands were dry, Shinji wrapped his arms around her, and then forced her backwards, until they were up against the counter on the other side of the kitchen. Asuka didn't even care when her back hit the edge of the counter, or that the handle of a drawer was digging into her thigh. She was lost in the moment, and nothing else mattered.

现在手已经干了，真嗣紧紧抱住她，然后将她向后推，直到两人靠在了厨房另一边的柜台上。明日香甚至不在乎自己的背撞上了柜台边缘，也不在意一个抽屉的把手正顶着她的大腿。她完全沉浸在这一刻，其他一切都无关紧要。

They kissed, desperate for this need to show their affection which they had been bottling up inside them this whole time. It was like weeks, if not months of built up tension between them was being released as they kissed. Shinji didn't know exactly when he had started wanting to experience these things with Asuka, but he was glad that they had reached this stage.

他们吻得迫切，这份需要表达爱意的渴望已在他们心中积压许久。仿佛是数周，甚至数月累积的紧张感，在他们的吻中得以释放。真嗣并不确切记得自己何时开始渴望与明日香体验这些，但他很高兴他们终于走到了这一步。

Pausing again, Shinji drew back, and then looked at Asuka in front of him. She was beginning to pant again, and sweat was permeating on her forehead. Her hair was messy as well, but Shinji didn't care that she looked this way. Placing a hand on her cheek, he caressed it gently, and then ran his forefinger along her lightly colored lips. They were moist, and Asuka closed her eyes as he did this. He could feel her slightly ragged breath coming through her parted lips, and Shinji began to feel himself loosing all means of common sense.

再次停顿，真嗣退后一步，凝视着面前的明日香。她又开始喘息，额头渗出汗水。她的头发也凌乱不堪，但真嗣并不介意她这副模样。他用手轻抚她的脸颊，然后沿着她淡色的唇轻轻划过。唇瓣湿润，明日香在他这样做时闭上了眼睛。他能感觉到她略显急促的呼吸从微张的唇间传来，真嗣开始感到自己失去了所有理智。

"Asuka...you're intoxicating..." mumbled Shinji.

“明日香……你真是令人陶醉……”真嗣喃喃道。

"Glad to know," smirked Asuka.

“很高兴知道，”明日香微微一笑。

As Shinji went to kiss her again though, she placed a hand over his mouth, and then took his hand.

然而，当真嗣再次想要吻她时，她用手捂住了他的嘴，然后握住了他的手。

"I know its early, but I want to go upstairs."

“我知道还早，但我想上楼去。”

Shinji's brain gave a brief jolt as she said this, but he nodded once to her, and then followed her slowly as she led the way upstairs. Kicking open the front door, Asuka crossed the threshold, and then fell onto the bed, dragging Shinji so that he collapsed on top of her. Asuka was smiling, her hand still holding onto Shinji's. She didn't know why, but she was beginning to feel nervous now that they were in the bedroom.

听到这话，真嗣的脑海中闪过一丝震动，但他还是向她点了点头，然后缓缓跟随她上楼。明日香一脚踢开前门，跨过门槛，随即倒在床上，顺势将真嗣也拉倒在她身上。明日香微笑着，手依然紧握着真嗣的。她不知道为什么，但此刻在卧室里，她开始感到紧张。

The passion from before was still there, but they were now more tender with each other. Shinji leaned in, kissing her sweetly this time. Time seemed to slow for him, and he lost himself in Asuka's lips more than once, but she didn't seem to care. She was even smiling now, as they kissed.

之前的激情依旧存在，但他们现在彼此更加温柔。真嗣倾身向前，这次温柔地吻了她。时间似乎为他放慢了脚步，他不止一次沉醉在明日香的双唇中，但她似乎并不介意。她甚至在接吻时露出了微笑。

Soon though, Shinji decided that it was best if they didn't push their luck anymore. Getting off the bed, he let out a weary sigh, and ran his hands through his hair. Asuka was watching him from the bed, wondering what was going through his mind right now.

然而不久，真嗣决定最好不要再冒险了。他下了床，疲惫地叹了口气，双手穿过头发。明日香从床上看着他，好奇他此刻在想些什么。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"You alright?" asked Asuka.

"你还好吗？" 明日香问道。

Shinji turned around to look at Asuka. Her hair was a disheveled mess, and she was sweating slightly, but other than that she was grinning from ear to ear. More than ever, Shinji wanted to go over there, push Asuka down, and wrap his arms, lips, and his whole body around her. Shinji wasn't prepared for that though.

真嗣转过身来看着明日香。她的头发凌乱不堪，微微出汗，但除此之外，她笑得合不拢嘴。真嗣比以往任何时候都更想走过去，把明日香推倒，用他的双臂、嘴唇和整个身体紧紧包围她。但他还没准备好这么做。

"Yeah...sorry." "嗯...抱歉。"

Asuka frowned at him, and then stood up, walking over to where he was.

明日香皱眉看着他，然后站起身，朝他所在的地方走去。

"Did you want to stop?" she asked.

"你想停下来吗？" 她问道。

"No," Shinji replied truthfully. "But anymore than this, and I may do something I'd regret."

"不，" 真嗣诚实地回答。"但再继续下去，我可能会做出让自己后悔的事。"

"...Well, if you did, and I don't think you have the spine for it, I'd just knock you out I suppose," smirked Asuka.

"...好吧，如果你真的做了，而且我觉得你没那个胆量，我大概会把你打晕吧，" 明日香带着一丝嘲讽的微笑说。

Shinji shook his head and said, "You really don't know how difficult it is for me to hold back do you?"

真嗣摇了摇头，说道：“你真的不知道我忍得多辛苦，是吧？”

'And how do you think I feel?' wondered Asuka.

“那你又觉得我是什么感受？”明日香心想。

Asuka wasn't finished however. Closing the gap between them, Asuka stood on her tiptoes, and kissed Shinji again. She didn't receive a reaction from him though, and leaned back when she was done.

然而，明日香并未就此罢休。她缩短了两人之间的距离，踮起脚尖，再次吻上了真嗣。但这次她没有得到他的回应，吻毕便退了回去。

'Fine, if you want to be stubborn that way,' thought Asuka.

'好吧，既然你非要这么固执，' 明日香心想。

Grabbing both his hands, she tugged him over to the bed against his will, and then threw him down on the bed.

她紧紧抓住他的双手，不顾他的意愿将他拽到床边，然后猛地将他推倒在床上。

"Asuka, I'm serious. Anymore of this and I-"

“明日香，我是认真的。再这样下去，我——”

Asuka sank down on top of him, pressing her entire body weight, along with her lips, into this kiss. She was almost smothering him, her lips refusing to leave his. Shinji felt like he was suffocating, and very nearly inhaled while Asuka was kissing him. Drawing back, Asuka looked down at Shinji, giving him a brief reprieve, and then continued her assault. She kissed him again, pressing her lips down on his, cradling his head in her hands. Asuka's mind was beginning to turn white again, as she quickly became lost in her passion.

明日香俯身压在他身上，用全身的重量和双唇加深了这个吻。她几乎要将他窒息，双唇紧贴着他的不肯离开。真嗣感觉自己快要窒息了，几乎在明日香亲吻他时吸了一口气。明日香稍稍退开，低头看着真嗣，给了他片刻的喘息，随即又继续她的攻势。她再次吻上他，双手捧着他的头，双唇紧压着他的。明日香的心智开始变得空白，很快便沉溺于自己的激情之中。

Shinji was doing everything within his power to remain sane, aware of Asuka warm body pressing against him, her developing breasts brushing against his chest, and her supple hips grinding against his. As he had said before, Asuka was intoxicating, like a drug that he had gotten hooked on. There were so many things that he wanted to do with her right now, but he forced himself to suppress those feelings.

真嗣正竭尽全力保持理智，感受到明日香温暖的身躯紧贴着他，她正在发育的胸部轻触他的胸膛，柔软的臀部在他身上磨蹭。正如他之前所说，明日香就像一种让他上瘾的毒品，令人陶醉。此刻，他有许多想与她一起做的事情，但他强迫自己压抑这些情感。

'Shit,' thought Shinji. 'I can't go on like this.'

“该死，”真嗣心想，“我不能再这样下去了。”

As he thought this, Asuka did something rather unexpected. Since it was their first time kissing, both knew very little about different ways of kissing. They were experiencing everything together for the first time though, so they were bound to want to experiment as well. Asuka in particular seemed to have become used to this far quicker than Shinji, and this was when she tried something different.

正当他这么想时，明日香做了一件相当出乎意料的事。由于这是他们第一次接吻，两人对不同的接吻方式知之甚少。尽管他们一起体验了所有第一次，因此也渴望尝试新事物。特别是明日香，她似乎比真嗣更快适应了这一切，这时她尝试了一些不同的东西。

Shinji felt Asuka's tongue enter his mouth. She was hesitant, unsure what she was doing, but it was something that she wanted to try. Shinji didn't know what to make of this, and for a moment, it was just Asuka kissing him while he lay there. Soon though, Shinji felt a pleasant shiver start from his head, and then travel down his body to his waist. As Asuka continued to kiss him, Shinji finally retaliated in a like manner. Hesitant himself, his tongue found Asuka's, and they began an awkward dance together, not entirely sure what they were doing. Shinji's hormones began to run wild, and he was aware that he was steadily growing rigid, something which Asuka would no doubt realize, but she seemed to be lost in this kiss, unaware of the things going on around her.

真嗣感觉到明日香的舌头进入了他的口中。她犹豫不决，不确定自己在做什么，但这却是她想尝试的事情。真嗣对此不知所措，一时间，只是明日香在他躺着的时候亲吻着他。然而不久，真嗣感到一股愉悦的颤栗从头顶开始，然后沿着身体传到腰部。随着明日香继续亲吻，真嗣终于以类似的方式回应了。他自己也犹豫不决，他的舌头找到了明日香的，他们开始了一场笨拙的共舞，不完全确定自己在做什么。真嗣的荷尔蒙开始狂飙，他意识到自己正逐渐变得坚硬，明日香无疑会察觉到这一点，但她似乎沉浸在这个吻中，对周围发生的事情浑然不觉。

Waves of pleasure washed over them as they continued kissing, tongues entwining with one another as they steadily became more used to this. Asuka had continued laying on Shinji, but getting lost in the moment, Shinji sat up and wrapped his arms around her, their hips grinding against each other. Briefly, Asuka backed away, a small moan leaking out from her mouth, but then she found Shinji's lips again, and they returned to the pleasure.

一波波快感如潮水般涌来，他们继续亲吻着，舌头交缠在一起，逐渐习惯了这种感觉。明日香一直躺在真嗣身上，但在这一刻，真嗣坐起身来，双臂环绕着她，两人的臀部相互摩擦。明日香短暂地退开，口中漏出一声轻吟，随即又找到了真嗣的唇，再次沉浸在欢愉之中。

Neither knew how much time passed as they sat like that in each others arms, but they eventually broke away. Asuka lips briefly lingered on Shinji's lips as they stopped kissing one another, but she still seemed hungry for more. Asuka realized though that anymore, and one of them might lose there self control.

他们不知道这样在彼此怀中坐了多久，但最终还是分开了。明日香的唇在停止亲吻时短暂地停留在真嗣的唇上，但她似乎仍渴望更多。然而，明日香意识到，再继续下去，他们中的一个可能会失去自制力。

They looked back at each other, both flushed slightly, and sweat permeating both their bodies. Asuka got off his lap silently, without speaking, and then went into the bathroom briefly. Shinji collapsed on the bed, his mind filled with white noise. If he didn't know any better, he would assume that he was dreaming right now. It seemed too surreal that him and Asuka had just finished kissing that passionately. Whatever he had thought about before, or fantasied about, the real thing was different. Pinching himself to be absolutely sure he wasn't dreaming, he heard a small laugh from behind him.

他们彼此对视，两人脸上都泛着微红，汗水浸透了彼此的身体。明日香默默地从他腿上下来，没有说话，然后短暂地走进了浴室。真嗣瘫倒在床上，脑海中一片空白。如果他不是那么清楚，他会以为自己现在正在做梦。他和明日香刚刚那般激情地接吻，这一切似乎太过不真实。无论他之前怎么想，或是幻想些什么，现实总是不同的。为了确保自己不是在做梦，他掐了自己一下，却听到身后传来一声轻笑。

"What are you doing?" asked Asuka as she stepped back into the bedroom.

“你在做什么？”明日香一边问着，一边退回到卧室。

'Making sure I'm not dreaming right now,' thought Shinji silently to himself. He wasn't really sure what to say to Asuka right now.

“确保我现在不是在做梦，”真嗣默默地对自己想。他不太确定现在该对明日香说什么。

Sitting up, Shinji saw that Asuka had changed out of the jeans and t-shirt that she had been wearing, and was now sporting shorts and a tank top. She seemed to have wiped the sweat from her body as well. He was glad that she hadn't been wearing that when they were kissing, since his hands very likely would have started roving along her body.

坐起身来，真嗣注意到明日香已经换下了她之前穿的牛仔裤和 T 恤，现在穿着短裤和背心。她似乎也擦掉了身上的汗水。他很庆幸他们在接吻时她没有穿那套衣服，因为他的手很可能会不由自主地在她身上游走。

Without another word, Asuka climbed in the bed, but instead of burying herself under the covers, she only threw the one sheet over herself. She was far too warm for all the blankets that kept them warm at night right now.

没有再多说一句话，明日香爬上了床，但没有钻进被窝，只是将一张床单盖在自己身上。现在她感到太热了，不需要那些夜晚用来保暖的厚被子。

Sitting up, Shinji glanced over at Asuka briefly, still unsure what to say to her. In the meanwhile, Shinji changed out of jeans and shirt, being sure to face away from her as he did this. He was still very much rigid, and didn't want her to see that, though it wasn't like she probably already didn't know.

坐起身来，真嗣短暂地瞥了明日香一眼，仍然不确定该对她说些什么。与此同时，真嗣脱下了牛仔裤和衬衫，确保背对着她进行这一动作。他依然非常僵硬，不想让她看到这一点，尽管她很可能已经知道了。

Done changing, Shinji slipped into the bed, tossing the one sheet over himself as Asuka had done. Both were still wide awake, but it didn't seem like either knew what to say. It had been a whirlwind of a day, and Shinji was having difficulties piecing it all together. His visions from earlier today seemed like a distant memory already, completely overshadowed by his and Asuka's first kiss.

换好衣服后，真嗣悄悄钻进被窝，像明日香那样拉过一张床单盖在身上。两人都还清醒着，但似乎谁也不知道该说什么。这一天过得如旋风般迅猛，真嗣难以将一切串联起来。今天早上的幻觉仿佛已成遥远的记忆，完全被他与明日香初吻的情景所掩盖。

"Um...Asuka?" “呃...明日香？”

"God, took you long enough to say something."

"天啊，你终于开口了，等得我都快睡着了。"

As Asuka said this, she rolled over to Shinji's side, and snuggled up him. She was grinning at him, her face tilted up towards him, as though expectantly waiting for something. Shinji wanted to kiss her, but now that they were under the covers, he found himself quickly falling asleep. The combination of the warmth of Asuka's body and the sheet were overpowering him.

正如明日香所说，她翻身到了真嗣身边，紧紧依偎着他。她对着他咧嘴笑，脸庞仰望着他，仿佛在期待着什么。真嗣想吻她，但此刻他们裹在被子下，他发现自己迅速陷入了沉睡。明日香身体的温暖和被单的包裹让他无法抵挡。

"Sorry Asuka. I'm feeling really sleepy suddenly."

"对不起，明日香。我突然感觉特别困。"

"Hmm, well I know what you mean I suppose."

“嗯，我想我明白你的意思。”

Yawning widely herself, Asuka drew even closer to Shinji, resting her head against his chest. Smiling warmly, Shinji wrapped his arms around her, and Asuka didn't even flinch as he did this, silently accepting his embrace.

自己也打了个大大的哈欠，明日香更紧地靠向真嗣，将头枕在他的胸前。真嗣温柔地笑着，双臂环绕着她，而明日香对此毫无抗拒，静静地接受了他的拥抱。

Asuka fell asleep quickly after Shinji held her, seeming far more sleepy than she had initially let on. As Shinji felt himself slowly falling asleep, he looked down at the beautiful girl wrapped in his arms. A loving smile began spreading across his face, as he looked at her.

在真嗣的怀抱中，明日香很快便入睡了，看起来比她最初表现出的还要困倦。真嗣感到自己也渐渐陷入梦乡，低头看着怀中美丽的女孩。他的脸上缓缓绽开一个充满爱意的微笑，凝视着她。

"I love you Asuka," Shinji whispered to her, and afterwards, passed into a deep slumber

“我爱你，明日香。” 真嗣对她低语，随后便沉沉睡去。

So after months of buildup inside the story, and years of buildup in writing this and Spawn of Adam, we finally get to see Shinji and Asuka kissing each other, and rather a lot as well, not to mention Shinji's whisper at the end. I've always strongly believed in a long steady character development, instead of jumping into the story and 'Surprise!' they're in love, and 'Surprise!' they're having sex.

经过故事内数月的铺垫，以及写作这部作品和‘亚当之子’数年的积累，我们终于能看到真嗣和明日香深情拥吻，而且相当频繁，更不用说真嗣最后的低语了。我一直坚信，应该通过长期稳定的角色发展，而不是直接跳进故事里，‘惊喜！’他们相爱了，‘惊喜！’他们发生了关系。

Anyways enough of that, onto more important stuff. So, one of the inherent problems I always knew with Two of Us was going to be how to connect the two halves of the story. I've said before that we're getting closer to the second half, and thats around six or seven chapter away, but before that, there are still some things to take care of. I've never been a fan of time skips over long periods of time, but their really isn't any other way of joining the two halves, so thats whats gonna happen. Plus, it allows me the ability to write them in progressively more sexual interactions as they age, so that helps.

总之，闲话少说，接下来谈些更重要的事。我一直清楚《我们俩》中一个固有的难题是如何将故事的两部分衔接起来。我之前提过，我们正逐渐接近第二部分，大约还有六七章的距离，但在那之前，还有一些事情需要处理。我向来不喜欢时间跳跃过长，但除此之外，似乎没有其他方法能将两部分连接起来，所以这就是即将发生的情况。此外，这让我能够随着他们年龄的增长，逐步描写他们之间更加亲密的互动，这也算是个好处。

In a nutshell, the next chapters are all going to be centered around specific things that happened between Shinji and Asuka as they continue to age, so the next chapter will take place in the summer.

简而言之，接下来的章节都将围绕着真嗣和明日香成长过程中发生的特定事件展开，所以下一章将发生在夏天。

Until then, everyone have a Merry Christmas, and I hope you all got what you wanted.

在此之前，祝大家圣诞快乐，希望你们都得到了自己想要的。

### Chapter 25: Attachment
依恋  

It was now summer, around mid July, and though the memories of that day in early March would always remain within Shinji's mind, time had passed since then. In reality, Shinji and Asuka had begun to lose any semblance of dates, and though it had steadily gotten warmer out, heralding the arrival of summer, neither knew what month they were in anymore. They still had the calendar, but had since forgotten about it, and neither paid it any attention. Instead, they focused on changes within themselves, and their outward exterior. Shinji was taller now, and though he had always been slightly taller than Asuka, it was more pronounced now. His hair was longer as well, and was a shaggy mop on his head that covered his forehead entirely, threatening to spill into his eyes. He had matured since that time, and though he didn't feel much older, if two pictures were placed side by side of him then, and now, the differences would have been striking.  
如今已是盛夏，大约七月中旬，尽管三月初那一天的记忆永远铭刻在真嗣心中，但时间已经流逝。实际上，真嗣和明日香已经开始逐渐忘记日期，尽管天气逐渐变暖，预示着夏天的到来，但他们已经不知道现在是几月份了。他们仍然有日历，但早已忘记它的存在，也都不再关注。相反，他们专注于自身的变化和外在表现。真嗣现在更高了，尽管他一直比明日香稍高一些，但现在这种差异更加明显。他的头发也更长了，像一团蓬乱的草丛覆盖着他的额头，几乎要遮住眼睛。自从那时起，他成熟了许多，尽管他并不觉得自己老了很多，但如果将他那时和现在的照片并排放置，差异会非常显著。

Asuka on the other hand had begun to develop her more womanly features to such an extent that Shinji felt wrong staring at her body sometimes. Her body was more curved, her breasts fuller, and her hips in particular looked as though they had been carved by some sculptor. Just seeing her body swaying in rhythm as she walked was enough for Shinji to want to embrace her. At one point, at the beginning of April, Asuka had trimmed her hair slightly, but it was now back to a long length, reaching almost to her waist. Asuka had matured as well, and though she still enjoyed teasing Shinji occasionally, she was no longer embarrassed about showing her affection towards him. This was something that had both happened to them really.  
另一方面，明日香的女性特质开始愈发明显，以至于有时真嗣盯着她的身体看都会感到不妥。她的身形更加曲线玲珑，胸部丰满，尤其是她的臀部，仿佛出自某位雕塑家之手。仅仅是看着她走路时身体摇曳的节奏，就足以让真嗣想要拥她入怀。四月初，明日香曾稍稍修剪过头发，但如今又恢复了长发，几乎垂至腰际。明日香也成熟了许多，虽然她偶尔还会捉弄真嗣，但已不再羞于表达对他的情感。这一切，确实在他们之间悄然发生。

Since it was summer, and the days were becoming considerably hotter, the need to keep the fireplace going most of the day was not as dire as it once was, but sometimes at night, they liked to start it anyway, especially on the occasions where they dozed on the couch together. With that said, their supply of wood had dwindled again, so Shinji was currently cutting more at the logging site he had created months ago. He had expanded the tree line further and further north until he had hit a large hillside, and then had started working his way west. He figured he may have to relocate eventually, but it was still many months before that, and hopefully they could make it through the winter.  
由于正值夏季，白昼愈发炎热，维持壁炉整日燃烧的需求已不如从前那般迫切，但夜晚时分，他们仍喜欢点燃它，尤其是在一起蜷缩在沙发上打盹的时候。话虽如此，他们的木柴储备再次减少，因此真嗣目前正在他几个月前开辟的伐木场砍伐更多木材。他不断向北扩展林地，直至遇到一座大山坡，随后便开始向西推进。他估计自己迟早需要搬迁，但那至少还有几个月的时间，希望他们能熬过这个冬天。

He was still practicing with his AT-field of course, and right now, now that he was done with the gathering of firewood, he was practicing again. He had steadily continued to develop his ability to control it, but it still wasn't satisfactory to him. He had made significant progress though.  
当然，他仍在练习 AT 力场，现在，完成了收集柴火的任务后，他又开始了练习。他稳步提升了自己控制 AT 力场的能力，但对他来说仍未达到满意水平。不过，他已经取得了显著的进步。

Shinji's feet hit the soft ground, and then he looked up towards the tree high above him. In his hand, he held a branch from the top of the tree which he had just cut off with his AT-field. He had finally succeeded in his attempt which had injured him back in March, and he was rather pleased with himself. It had all been a matter of timing, though his own physical body's growth didn't hurt either.  
真嗣的双脚踏上柔软的土地，随即抬头望向高耸入云的树梢。他手中握着一根刚用 AT 力场切下的树顶枝条。终于，他在三月份受伤的那次尝试成功了，这让他颇为自得。一切都是时机问题，当然，他身体的成长也功不可没。

Throwing the smaller branch into the back of his truck for the hell of it, he jumped into the front seat, and then began the bumpy drive back, weaving around the stumps of old trees which he had previously felled. Asuka would probably be back from the grocery store by now, and he hadn't seen her since the morning, so he was eagerly awaiting to see her cheerful face.  
他随手将较小的树枝扔进卡车后斗，跳进驾驶座，开始了颠簸的回程，穿梭于之前砍倒的树桩之间。明日香大概已经从杂货店回来了，而他从早上起就没见过她，因此他热切期待着看到她那张欢快的脸庞。

---

Parking in the driveway, he stepped out and decided to leave the firewood for later. The chance of it raining was near zero, so he didn't have to worry about that so much. Walking along the side of the house, he opened the sliding glass door. The station wagon was already back, as Shinji expected it to be, so he wasn't surprised to see Asuka working in the kitchen. They had a routine that they had started going through, and both knew roughly the times to expect the other back at the house, and so Asuka was just finishing a small lunch when Shinji returned.  
他把车停在车道上，下车后决定把柴火留到稍后再处理。下雨的可能性几乎为零，所以他不必过于担心。沿着房子的一侧走去，他打开了滑动玻璃门。那辆旅行车已经回来了，正如真嗣所预料的那样，所以他并不惊讶看到明日香在厨房里忙碌。他们有一个已经形成的日常习惯，两人大致知道对方何时会回家，因此当真嗣回来时，明日香正好在准备一份小午餐。

"Ah, good, you're back. I was just about finished," said Asuka as she noticed his presence.  
“啊，太好了，你回来了。我刚要弄完，”明日香注意到他的到来，说道。

Shinji sat at the dining table in the kitchen, and then moments later, Asuka brought out his lunch. Shinji accepted it gratefully, and then received a quick kiss, which he was also grateful, and quite happy for. They had become so used to kissing each other, that it was a normal occurrence in their daily life, but that didn't make it any less sweet. Even now, they would sometimes just start kissing each other, without any worry about which room they were in the house, or even outside. They had once gotten sidetracked while going to the hot springs, and had ended up kissing each other in the car for thirty minutes or so.  
真嗣坐在厨房的餐桌旁，片刻后，明日香端出了他的午餐。真嗣感激地接过，随即得到了一个快速的吻，对此他也同样心怀感激，且颇为欣喜。他们已经习惯了彼此亲吻，这已成为他们日常生活中的常态，但这并未减少它的甜蜜。即便现在，他们有时也会毫无顾忌地开始亲吻对方，不在乎身处家中哪个房间，甚至在外面也是如此。有一次，他们在前往温泉的路上分了心，结果在车里亲吻了大约三十分钟。

They talked while they ate, chatting about anything that came to their minds. Asuka's initial conception about the food in the grocery store was turning out to be wrong, and so they would soon have to start driving further for food. When they realized this, Asuka toyed with the idea of starting her own garden, though this came with a multitude of problems, and she would had to have started back in early spring for it to be affective. Knowing that winter was less than six months away worried them slightly, but they didn't talk about this.  
他们边吃边聊，随意地聊着脑海中浮现的任何话题。明日香最初对杂货店食物的看法似乎是错误的，因此他们很快就需要开车更远的地方去买食物。意识到这一点后，明日香萌生了开辟自己花园的想法，但这伴随着诸多问题，她本应在早春就开始行动才能有效。得知冬天不到六个月就要来临，他们略感担忧，但并未就此展开讨论。

Their daily lives continued in a similar manner to how things had been during the two an a half months spent in their old house in Tokyo-2, but even those times were beginning to fade from their memory. Before long, it would almost be a full year since they had begun living together, waking up on the beach of Tokyo-3 those many months ago. Whatever had happened in the past, was now the past, and so, they continued living without much worry about what the future might hold.  
他们的日常生活依旧与在东京-2 旧居度过的两个半月相似，但即便那些时光也正逐渐从记忆中淡去。不久之后，他们同居生活将满一年，想起数月前在东京-3 海滩上的醒来，过往种种已成过去。无论曾经发生什么，都已成为历史，于是他们继续生活，对未来不甚忧虑。

When Shinji was done eating, Asuka took his plate and washed it, along with her own, and Shinji leaned back in his chair relaxed, looking up at the white ceiling. Shinji wasn't in any hurry to continue developing their relationship, as he felt both were still too young to dive into the things associated with adults, but thats not to say he didn't think about it.  
当真嗣吃完饭后，明日香接过他的盘子，连同自己的一起清洗，而真嗣则靠在椅背上，放松地仰望白色天花板。真嗣并不急于推进他们的关系，他认为两人都还太年轻，不宜涉足成人世界的事物，但这并不意味着他从未思考过。

Whenever he held Asuka, kissed her, felt her body against his, there was always a thought in the back of his mind of 'will something happen?' Both had been careful in this regard, always breaking off physical contact to gather their thoughts instead of becoming lost in the moment. Once or twice, things had come rather close on certain occasions, but reasoning had always won through. Asuka herself seemed to have a rather particular reasoning for abstaining from this, but Shinji didn't know what it was, nor did he ask. She was always rather keen on reminding him on boundaries, and what she'd do if he attempted to cross them. Well, Shinji felt that she herself had to be reminded occasionally of these boundaries as well. Asuka was still very assertive whenever the mood struck her, and Shinji had lost track of how many times her teeth had sunk into his neck.  
每当他拥抱着明日香，亲吻她，感受她的身体紧贴着自己时，脑海中总会浮现一个念头：“会不会发生什么？”两人在这方面都格外小心，总是及时中断肢体接触，以便整理思绪，而非迷失于当下。有几次，情况险些失控，但理智总能占据上风。明日香似乎有她独特的理由克制自己，但真嗣并不知晓，也未曾询问。她总是热衷于提醒他界限所在，以及逾越界限的后果。然而，真嗣觉得她有时也需要被提醒这些界限。明日香的情绪一旦上来，依然会表现得相当强势，真嗣已经记不清有多少次她的牙齿咬进了他的脖颈。

Above all else though, Shinji was still wondering when the words would be spoken between them. Now, there was never a moment where Shinji didn't believe that she felt that way for him, but the words, 'I love you,' coming from her, was something that he sincerely hoped to hear at some point. While he hadn't said these words to her specifically, he had mumbled them a few times besides that night when they first kissed. Once or twice, he had felt like saying them to her while they kissed, but he always held back. He wasn't sure how she'd react in all honesty. Asuka was fine showing her feelings physically now, but speaking them out loud was still difficult for her, as though someone may be eavesdropping on them. This was of course a ridiculous notion.  
然而，最重要的是，真嗣一直在想他们之间何时会说出那句话。现在，真嗣从未怀疑过她对他的感情，但那句“我爱你”从她口中说出来，是他真心希望有朝一日能听到的。虽然他没有直接对她说过这些话，但在他们第一次接吻的那个晚上，他曾含糊地嘟囔过几次。有一两次，他在接吻时觉得应该告诉她，但他总是忍住了。他不确定她会有什么反应，说实话。如今，明日香在肢体上表达感情已经很自然了，但大声说出来对她来说仍然很难，仿佛有人在偷听他们似的。当然，这是一个荒谬的想法。

He thought about these things, leaning back in his chair at the dining table, while the sounds of Asuka working in front of the sink filled his ears. He had hardly seen her at all today, so he wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. Shinji himself had grown more accustomed to displaying his feelings for her, and it was no longer Asuka who always took the first step.  
他靠在餐桌旁的椅子上，思考着这些事情，而明日香在洗碗池前忙碌的声音充斥着他的耳朵。今天他几乎没怎么见到她，所以他想尽可能多地和她在一起。真嗣自己也越来越习惯于向她表达自己的感情，不再是明日香总是主动迈出第一步。

Standing up, Shinji walked silently over to where Asuka was working. She was humming quietly to herself, focused on what she was doing, so she didn't notice him. Erasing his presence entirely, he slowly wrapped his hands around her waist, causing Asuka to jump immensely, splashing the water that she had been using from a gallon jug all over the counter. Asuka had found a small river within the towns limits shortly after they had moved in, and this is how they began washing the dishes every night. But it was still a lot of water to lose all in one go.  
站起身来，真嗣默默地走向正在工作的明日香。她正轻声哼着歌，专注于手头的事情，所以没有注意到他。他完全隐去了自己的存在感，缓缓地用双手环住她的腰，这让明日香猛地一跳，将原本用大水壶倒出的水溅得满台都是。自从他们搬进来后不久，明日香就在城镇的范围内找到了一条小河，从此他们每晚都这样洗碗。但一次性浪费这么多水还是让人心疼。

Darting around to look at Shinji who was directly behind him, Asuka scolded him saying-  
明日香迅速转身看向站在身后的真嗣，责备道——

"Don't do that. I just filled this thing earlier today, and half of it is already gone now thanks to your idiocy."  
“别这样。我今天刚装满这水壶，现在一半都被你的愚蠢行为给浪费了。”

"Can I help it if I haven't seen you at all today?"  
"难道我能控制自己今天一整天都没见到你吗？"

Asuka frowned at him, but turned around, returning to her work with Shinji's arms still wrapped around her waist. She wasn't about to tell him to stop holding her, since she was always pleased whenever he did so, but it was slightly different when she was focusing on something. Shinji had gotten good at concealing himself, and Asuka had her suspicions about this, but never commented on it. He knew what he was doing, and what he felt best, so she left it as it was.  
明日香皱着眉头看着他，但还是转过身去，继续她的工作，而真嗣的手臂依然环抱着她的腰。她并不打算让他停止拥抱，因为她总是很高兴他这样做，但当她专注于某件事时，感觉略有不同。真嗣已经很擅长隐藏自己，明日香对此有所怀疑，但从未提及。他知道自己该做什么，也知道什么最适合自己，所以她任由事情保持原样。

As Asuka continued cleaning the dishes though, Shinji rested his head on her shoulder, causing Asuka to start squirming with his messy hair brushing against her neck. She was constantly trying to have him let her cut it, but he was stubborn about this.  
尽管明日香继续洗着碗，真嗣却把头靠在她的肩上，这让明日香因为他的乱发拂过她的脖子而开始扭动。她一直试图让他同意剪头发，但他对此非常固执。

"Shinji quit it. You're distracting me."  
"真嗣，别闹了。你分散我注意力了。"

Shinji only responded by brushing his lips softly against her neck, making Asuka squirm even further, but washing the dishes was beginning to disappear from her mind.  
真嗣只是轻轻地用嘴唇拂过她的脖子作为回应，这让明日香更加扭动不安，洗碗这件事也渐渐从她脑海中消失。

'Fine, you win,' thought Asuka, as she turned around, and locked lips with him.  
'好吧，你赢了，'明日香想着，转过身去，与他唇齿相依。

Thirty minutes roughly passed when Asuka finally untangled herself from Shinji's arms on the couch. While she always enjoyed these moments, she told him that under no such circumstances was he allowed to enter the kitchen now until she was done.  
大约三十分钟过去，明日香终于从真嗣的怀抱中挣脱出来，坐到了沙发上。尽管她总是享受这些时刻，但她还是告诉他，在任何情况下，他都不允许在她完成之前进入厨房。

Shinji sighed rather heavily, but nodded all the same, deciding to continue reading from his book. He had already gone through the books within the house multiple times, and had since started pillaging nearby houses, looking for anything suitable to read. Asuka was the same, though her taste in books was rather skewed towards romance currently, something she probably never would have read eight months ago. Shinji didn't care as long as the premise was interesting enough, he'd give the book a chance.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，但还是点了点头，决定继续从他的书上读下去。他已经把家里的书翻了好几遍，于是开始搜刮附近的房子，寻找任何适合阅读的东西。明日香也是如此，尽管她现在的阅读品味偏向于浪漫小说，这可能是她八个月前绝不会读的类型。真嗣不在乎，只要前提足够有趣，他就会给这本书一个机会。

He kept reading, until Asuka was finished, and then sat down on the couch beside him, stretching out so that her legs were resting on his lap. The couch was large enough for three people to sit on it, so this was an easily done feet. Setting his book down beside him, he glanced over at Asuka, seeing that she was watching him. He assumed that it was alright to kiss her again, but Asuka brought something up instead.  
他继续阅读，直到明日香完成，然后坐在他旁边的沙发上，伸展开来，把腿搭在他的腿上。沙发足够大，可以容纳三个人坐下，所以这很容易做到。他把书放在身边，瞥了一眼明日香，发现她在看着他。他以为可以再次吻她，但明日香提出了别的事情。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"We should do something today."  
“我们今天应该做点什么。”

"Oh, like what?" "哦，比如什么？"

"I don't know. I was honestly hoping you had an idea."  
"我不知道。老实说，我本来希望你有个主意。"

"Well, its been a while since we drove to Kyoto. We could always do that."  
"嗯，我们很久没开车去京都了。我们可以再去一次。"

"Rejected." "被拒绝了。"

They occasionally did this, just to break out of the routine, and drove to Kyoto. Initially, they hadn't spent much time in the city back at the end of February and early March, but they had driven there about a dozen times now. The city held so many national heritage sites, that they had been to nearly all of them by now. Most of the roads were now open as well, thanks to Shinji's use of his AT-field. They had even driven far south to Osaka, and spent a night there, but the destruction thanks to Third Impact had left the city in ruins so badly, that seeing the devastation reminded them of the world they now lived in. They hadn't been back since.  
他们偶尔会这样做，只是为了打破常规，于是驱车前往京都。起初，他们在二月底和三月初并没有在京都逗留太久，但现在他们已经去过大约十几次了。京都拥有众多国家遗产，他们几乎已经参观了所有这些地方。多亏了真嗣使用他的 AT 力场，大多数道路现在都已开放。他们甚至驱车南下到大阪，并在那里过了一夜，但第三次冲击造成的破坏使得这座城市满目疮痍，看到这片废墟让他们想起了现在生活的世界。自那以后他们就再也没有回去过。

"Well, if not Kyoto, then what?"  
"好吧，如果不是京都，那还有什么地方呢？"

"I don't know...I'm thinking," mumbled Asuka as she tilted her head up to the ceiling.  
"我不知道...我在想，" 明日香咕哝着，将头仰向天花板。

Shinji watched her, but eventually, Asuka gave up and shrugged her shoulders.  
真嗣看着她，但最终，明日香放弃了，耸了耸肩。

"Well, I'll think of something later I suppose."  
"嗯，我想晚点会有办法的。"

Swinging her legs off Shinji's lap, she crawled across the couch towards him, and then leaned in to kiss him. Shinji met her lips happily, as he slowly sank into the couch with Asuka on top of him. Asuka kissed him softly, drawing out each kiss for as long as possible. The experience they had lacked initially had been completely overturned so that each knew what the other enjoyed. Soon, Asuka was grinning in spite of the situation, enjoying the pleasant feel of Shinji's lips against her own. With every kiss, she felt like she was melting in his arms.  
她从真嗣的腿上晃下双腿，爬过沙发向他靠近，然后倾身吻了他。真嗣欣然迎上她的唇，随着阿斯卡压在他身上，他缓缓陷入沙发中。阿斯卡温柔地吻着他，尽可能延长每一次亲吻。他们最初缺乏的经验已被彻底颠覆，以至于彼此都了解对方的喜好。很快，尽管处境尴尬，阿斯卡还是忍不住笑了起来，享受着真嗣唇间传来的愉悦感觉。每一次亲吻，她都觉得自己在他怀里融化。

'God, how did I end up like this?' wondered Asuka. 'How did I become so desperate for this that all other thoughts are immediately shut off? Why does kissing Shinji feel so perfect, as though it was meant to happen?'  
'天啊，我怎么会变成这样？'阿斯卡心想。'我是如何变得如此渴望这一切，以至于其他念头立刻被屏蔽？为什么吻真嗣感觉如此完美，仿佛这一切都是命中注定？'

Asuka didn't know the answer to these questions. Sure, she was in the midst of puberty, but that only explained half of the situation. If it had been any other guy, Asuka didn't think she would be having these reactions, these excited feelings coursing through her body, as though a gate within her had been opened. She longed to do more, but knew the possible repercussions.  
阿斯卡不知道这些问题的答案。当然，她正处于青春期，但这只能解释一半的情况。如果是其他男孩，阿斯卡不认为自己会有这些反应，这些兴奋的感觉在她体内奔涌，仿佛她内心的一扇门被打开了。她渴望做更多，但知道可能的后果。

Breaking off the kiss, Asuka leaned away from him, but still remained firmly on his waist. She felt a reaction from him, but she ignored it. Shinji was a guy afterall, and she had become used to this, but their was still a certain amount of curiosity mixed up within it all.  
结束亲吻，明日香从他身上微微后仰，但依旧稳稳地坐在他的腰间。她感觉到他的反应，却选择忽视。毕竟，真嗣是个男生，对此她已习以为常，但内心深处仍混杂着一丝好奇。

Before she allowed these thoughts to take hold of her in her hormonal state, she removed herself from Shinji's lap, sitting on the couch cushion beside him. There was much to be said about her feelings for Shinji, but Asuka had difficulties putting it to words. It was just something she felt, and that was it.  
在她被荷尔蒙驱使的思绪占据之前，明日香从真嗣的腿上起身，坐到了他旁边的沙发垫上。关于她对真嗣的感情，有很多话可以说，但明日香难以用言语表达。那是一种她内心深处的感受，仅此而已。

Sitting up, Shinji stretched as though he had just gotten done with a workout, and Asuka had to laugh at that. Glancing over at her, Shinji smirked briefly, but then stood up. He had tarried long enough with the firewood, and decided to get it out of the way.  
坐起身来，真嗣伸了个懒腰，仿佛刚完成了一场锻炼，这让明日香忍不住笑出声。他瞥了她一眼，短暂地笑了笑，然后站起身来。他已经和柴火纠缠太久，决定尽快解决这件事。

---

Shinji had probably chopped more than what was needed, so it took him longer than usual, but when he was done, he walked inside and washed his hands. Asuka, who had been sitting outside on the patio and reading, suddenly came in. She was grinning in a certain way that made Shinji assume she had decided what to do today, and when she spoke, Shinji confirmed that.  
真嗣可能切得比需要的多了些，所以花的时间比平时长，但当他完成后，他走进屋内洗了洗手。明日香一直坐在外面的露台上读书，突然也进来了。她带着某种得意的笑容，让真嗣猜想她已经决定了今天的计划，而当她开口时，真嗣证实了自己的猜测。

"I know what we're doing," exclaimed Asuka.  
“我知道我们要做什么了，”明日香兴奋地宣布。

"...Okay." “……好吧。”

"But I'm not telling you until its ready. So with that said, I need you to vacate the house for a while."  
"但我不打算在它准备好之前告诉你。所以，这么说吧，我需要你暂时离开这房子一会儿。"

"...Huh?" mumbled Shinji.  
""...啊？"" 真嗣嘟囔道。

"It's a surprise is what I'm saying. So I want you gone for a while."  
"我要说的是，这是个惊喜。所以我想让你离开一会儿。"

"...Alright," said Shinji, wondering what sort of idea Asuka had conjured up within her mind.  
"...好吧," 真嗣说道，心中好奇明日香又想出了什么主意。

With that said, Shinji stepped into his truck and then sat there, trying to decide what he wanted to do to pass the time. But Asuka came out, carrying several empty gallon jugs, and the one that had partially spilled earlier.  
说完，真嗣上了他的卡车，坐在那里，试图决定如何打发时间。但明日香走了出来，手里拿着几个空的大水壶，包括之前部分洒出的那个。

"Since you made me spill this earlier, you can at least take the time to fill all these back up. Plus, this also gives you something to do while you're waiting."  
"既然你之前让我洒了这些，你至少可以花点时间把它们都重新装满。而且，这也给你在等待时找点事情做。"

"If you say so," sighed Shinji.  
"既然你这么说，" 真嗣叹了口气。

Frowning, Asuka said, "I do. And take as much time as possible if you can." Kissing him quickly on the cheek, Asuka hurried back inside, closing the sliding glass door with a loud snap that Shinji could hear, but not see.  
皱着眉头，明日香说："我确实这么想。如果可以的话，尽量多花点时间。" 她迅速在他脸颊上亲了一下，匆匆回到屋内，用力关上滑动玻璃门，发出一声响亮的啪嗒声，真嗣能听见，却看不见。

Sighing again, Shinji grumbled briefly before putting the truck in reverse, and backed out of the driveway. It had been a while since he had seen Asuka this excited about something.  
再次叹息，真嗣咕哝了几句，然后将卡车挂入倒档，倒出了车道。他已经很久没见过明日香对某件事这么兴奋了。

Reaching the top of their hill, he turned left, going in the direction of town. In truth, it was usually Asuka who went into town, since she was in charge of getting groceries, even though Shinji was the one usually left with cooking dinner. She had grown so accustomed to his cooking ability, that she preferred that he cook, since she enjoyed it that much. Shinji normally left it up to her to decide whatever he made, so she usually gathered things while at the store which she wanted. Shinji didn't mind this, since it was nice to know how much she appreciated him.  
到达山顶后，他向左转，朝着城镇的方向走去。实际上，通常是明日香进城，因为她负责采购杂货，尽管通常是真嗣留下来做饭。她已经习惯了他的烹饪能力，以至于她更喜欢他来做饭，因为她非常享受。真嗣通常让她决定做什么菜，所以她通常在商店里挑选她想要的东西。真嗣对此并不介意，因为知道她有多么欣赏他，这感觉很好。

Coasting down the first hill to the bluff overlooking the town, he turned onto main street, and then drove down the second hill, reaching the flat land of the town. He passed the turn for the grocery store on his right, and a mix of small Japanese and English restaurants alike, before turning onto the main highway. Turning right would take him towards the highway which would lead to Kyoto, but instead he turned left.  
沿着第一个山坡滑下，俯瞰着城镇的悬崖，他转上主街，然后驶下第二个山坡，到达城镇的平坦地带。他经过右边通往杂货店的转弯，以及一系列日式和英式小餐馆，然后转上主干道。向右转会带他上高速公路，通往京都，但他却向左转了。

He had only been up this way a handful of times, mostly with Asuka, but this was the way to the small river. He snaked his way further in as he drove along the road past growing rows of trees. He soon hit an incline, and the engine of the truck began roaring as the transmission changed gears since Shinji's foot depressed the gas more and more. Reaching the top of the hill, Shinji felt a sense of weightlessness as he looked down to the valley below. He was perched on top of hill and far below him, he could just make out the bridge that would be his destination. Letting his foot off the break, he coasted his way down the hill, coming to a stop beside the bridge.  
他只来过这里几次，大多是和明日香一起，但这条路通往那条小河。他沿着道路继续深入，穿过一排排逐渐增多的树木。不久，道路开始上坡，随着真嗣的脚越来越用力地踩下油门，卡车的引擎开始轰鸣，变速箱也随之换挡。到达山顶时，真嗣感到一阵失重，俯瞰着下方的山谷。他站在山顶，远远地可以看到他的目的地——那座桥。松开刹车，他顺势滑下山坡，最终停在桥边。

Shinji jumped out, grabbing the many gallon jugs as he did. The river flowed underneath the bridge, and there was a small path beside the shoulder that wound its way down to the riverbed below. The river wasn't very large, about twenty five feet across, and didn't have a single point where the water went over Shinji's head.  
真嗣跳下车，抓起几个大水罐。河水在桥下流淌，桥边有一条小径蜿蜒而下，通向河床。这条河并不宽，大约二十五英尺，水深没有一处超过真嗣的头顶。

Walking down the narrow path, Shinji first kicked off his shoes and rolled up his jeans to his knees before stepping into the water. The sun was high in the sky, and it was unbearably hot out, so Shinji rather enjoyed having this opportunity to cool himself. After he had finished filling all of the jugs, he set them to the side and pulled off his shirt, before doing the same with his pants and underwear. Nobody was going to stumble upon him right now, so there was no problem going in naked.  
沿着狭窄的小径走去，真嗣先是踢掉了鞋子，卷起牛仔裤至膝盖，然后踏入水中。阳光高悬，天气热得让人难以忍受，因此真嗣很享受这个能让自己凉快一下的机会。他装满所有水壶后，将它们放在一旁，脱下衬衫，接着同样脱掉了裤子和内裤。此刻无人会偶然发现他，所以赤身裸体也没什么问题。

Wading into the middle of the river so that the water was above his waist, he suddenly dunked his head into the water, and then quickly came up, feeling refreshed. It was nice that they went to the hot springs at least once a week, and sometimes even more, but the coolness of the river in summer was more applicable.  
他涉水到河中央，水位没过腰际，突然将头浸入水中，随即迅速抬起，感到神清气爽。虽然他们至少每周都会去一次温泉，有时甚至更频繁，但夏日里河水的清凉更为适宜。

He swam for a while, wasting away the time just as Asuka had told him, but his thoughts began to drift towards her. There was a constant strain on his self control whenever he kissed Asuka, or interacted with her in any sort of sense which could be deemed sexual. He knew he loved her, and therefore wanted to show that love in every form imaginable, but knew that he couldn't. There was a certain line that they couldn't cross currently, and while they may put one toe over the line occasionally, never did they step over it. Doing so would invoke a whole different reality for them. Shinji wasn't immune to his desires though, and had acted on them once or twice, always to his self loathing afterwards. It may seem natural to most guys that Shinji did this, but to Shinji, his love for Asuka was to a point that it felt wrong masturbating while thinking of her.  
他游了一会儿，正如明日香所吩咐的那样消磨时间，但思绪却不由自主地飘向了她。每当他与明日香接吻，或是以任何可能被视为带有性意味的方式与她互动时，他总感到自我控制的紧绷。他知道自己爱她，因此渴望以各种想象得到的形式表达这份爱，但他明白自己不能。他们之间有一条目前无法逾越的界限，尽管偶尔他们会试探性地越过一点，却从未真正跨过。这样做会为他们带来一个全新的现实。尽管如此，真嗣并非对自己的欲望无动于衷，他曾一两次屈从于它们，事后总是陷入自我厌恶。对大多数男生来说，真嗣这样做或许显得很自然，但对真嗣而言，他对明日香的爱已经到了一个地步，一想到她便自慰，让他觉得这是错误的。

Stopping mid breaststroke, he planted his feet on the smooth rocks under his feet, and slowly walked out of the water. He dressed quickly, and then grabbed the gallon jugs now filled with water. He hadn't spent nearly enough time here, and therefore, would have to find another way to waste time for a few hours more. But he was starting to feel strong desires again, and decided that it was best not to linger here any longer. Something which would take his mind off said person was what he needed right now.  
他突然停下蛙泳，双脚踩在脚下的光滑岩石上，缓缓走出水面。他迅速穿上衣服，然后抓起已经装满水的加仑水壶。他在这里待的时间远远不够，因此，不得不寻找其他方式再消磨几个小时。但他又开始感到强烈的欲望，决定最好不再逗留。他现在需要的是一些能让他不去想那个人的事情。

Meanwhile, Asuka was in the middle of her own problems. This wasn't the first time she was forced into a situation where lacking normal food necessitates had given her headaches. She had normally been able to work her way around this, but it didn't seem like she would be able to this time.  
与此同时，明日香正忙于处理自己的问题。这不是她第一次因为缺乏正常的食物需求而头疼。通常她都能设法解决，但这次似乎行不通了。

Asuka complained under her breath as she busied herself around the kitchen. Each counter was laden with plates and dishes, and the grill on the patio outside look as though a heart attack was imminent, if at all possible. There were far too many things happening all at once that Asuka was trying to supervise, that her head felt like exploding...and all over a stupid idea she had had about an hour ago.  
明日香一边在厨房里忙碌，一边低声抱怨。每个台面上都堆满了盘子和餐具，露台外的烤架看起来就像随时可能心脏病发作，如果真有可能的话。太多事情同时发生，明日香试图监督一切，以至于她的头感觉快要爆炸了……这一切都源于一小时前她那愚蠢的想法。

'Why did I force myself into this situation?' wondered Asuka as she opened cupboards left and right. She hadn't felt this rushed since she had cooked Christmas dinner those many months ago, and that was now nothing but a distant memory.  
‘我为什么要把自己逼到这种境地？’明日香一边左右打开橱柜，一边想着。自从几个月前她做圣诞晚餐以来，她从未感到如此匆忙，而那已经成了遥远的记忆。

She had started immediately after Shinji left, and when she had started, she realized just how daunting a task she had ahead of her, that is, if she wanted to follow the norm of things. The question that was posed in her mind shortly after she started was, 'how exactly do I make a picnic with the limited options I have?' For this is what Asuka was trying to create: a dinner that could be considered a picnic, shared between them in the large field behind their house. Quickly, she realized how impossible this was.  
她是在真嗣离开后立即开始的，而当她开始时，她意识到自己面前的是一项多么艰巨的任务，也就是说，如果她想遵循常规的话。她开始后不久，心中就浮现了一个问题：‘我究竟该如何用有限的选项来准备一次野餐？’这就是明日香试图创造的：一顿可以被视为野餐的晚餐，在他们家后面的大草地上与他们共享。很快，她意识到这有多么不可能。

Her thoughts went first to a typical Japanese bento, but besides the rice, there wasn't much that could be used. Next came an American picnic, but that was even less useful, since she had no way of making sandwiches, and even if she had bread, cheese, meats, and vegetables were impossible to come by. With all this assumed, she created something of a frankenstein picnic, but had hit a road block. How was she supposed to keep everything warm during the hike down to the field? It would have been easy just to forgo the whole concept, but Asuka was far too stubborn for this. The most obvious means was just to have everything be eaten cold, but with most things being canned goods that required heating up to eat, this was difficult. Asuka had done her best, but still wasn't satisfied with the current results.  
她的思绪首先飘向了典型的日式便当，但除了米饭，可用之物并不多。接着她想到了美式野餐，但那更不切实际，因为她无法制作三明治，即便有面包，奶酪、肉类和蔬菜也无处寻觅。在这样的假设下，她拼凑出一种怪异的野餐组合，却遇到了难题：如何在徒步前往田野的过程中保持食物温热？放弃整个想法本是最简单的选择，但明日香太过固执，不愿就此罢休。最显而易见的方法是让所有食物冷食，但大多数罐头食品需要加热才能食用，这让她感到棘手。明日香已尽全力，却仍对当前的结果感到不满。

She didn't know what she was aiming for, and hardly understood her reasoning behind what she was doing, but she knew that it was ultimately for Shinji. Maybe she felt that things had stagnated between them lately. While they still kissed, and plenty at that, gone was the initial excitement and thrill that they had first experienced. Asuka was still very happy every time they kissed, but she wanted more. Lately, that was all that she had been feeling. Kissing wasn't enough, touching wasn't enough, she always wanted more. She still understood the boundaries, but she was always wishing that they weren't there, even though she had practically set them there herself. How many times had Asuka stopped herself while they were in bed together, when everything felt so strong? She had lost track by now.  
她不知道自己究竟在追求什么，几乎不明白自己行为的理由，但她知道这一切归根结底是为了真嗣。或许她感觉到最近两人之间的关系陷入了停滞。尽管他们依然接吻，而且次数不少，但最初的兴奋与激情已不复存在。每次接吻，明日香仍然感到非常幸福，但她渴望更多。近来，这种感觉愈发强烈。仅仅是亲吻和触摸已无法满足她，她总是想要更多。她依然明白界限所在，却总是希望那些界限不存在，尽管实际上正是她自己设定了这些界限。有多少次，当他们同床共枕，情感强烈到难以自持时，明日香阻止了自己？她已经记不清了。

Pausing in the middle of what she was doing, Asuka glanced around the house. It felt significantly more empty without Shinji there, something which Asuka was always reminded of whenever he left for a few hours. She was beginning to wish she hadn't asked him to leave, but that would also spoil so much. She wanted this to be unique, though in all honesty, she wasn't sure how well this would play out.  
停下手中的活计，明日香环顾了一下房子。没有了真嗣在，这里显得空荡荡的，每当他离开几个小时，明日香总会意识到这一点。她开始后悔让他离开，但这也会破坏很多东西。她希望这是特别的，尽管说实话，她不确定这会如何发展。

---

Shinji didn't know how much time had passed since he had left the river: it had been several more hours certainly. He didn't have much thought in what direction he drove, though he had ended up driving closer to Kyoto. It wasn't long before he arrived at the highway that would take him to Kyoto if he so chose, but he continued driving over the bridge. He hadn't actually been out this way before, but decided to now.  
真嗣不知道自己离开河边已经多久了：肯定又过了好几个小时。他开车时并没有多想方向，结果却越来越靠近京都。不久后，他就来到了通往京都的高速公路入口，如果他愿意的话，但他继续驾车过桥。他以前从未走过这条路，但现在决定试试。

He drove by farmland for a while, just as what was on the opposite side, towards their house, but he soon came upon a large town, part of the larger Kyoto metropolitan area. Complete with its own police station, fire station, and K-12 schools, it was a much larger town then Shinji had expected. As with most towns around Kyoto, it also had plenty of shrines dedicated mainly to buddhist teachings. Shinji didn't have any religious beliefs, but even he felt like stepping out and praying to a shrine briefly. If nothing more, it may help his mind calm itself for a bit.  
他驾车经过一片农田，与对面通往他们家的景象相似，但不久便来到了一个较大的城镇，属于京都市更大的都会区的一部分。这里不仅有警察局、消防站和 K-12 学校，规模远超真嗣的预期。与京都周边大多数城镇一样，这里也有许多主要供奉佛教教义的神社。真嗣并无宗教信仰，但即便如此，他仍感到一种下车短暂参拜神社的冲动。即便没有其他目的，这或许能让他心境稍稍平静片刻。

After driving around for a while, he got out, and decided to walk around, just to kill time. It was always a strange feeling whenever he walked on streets now. Was it even possible to consider this public anymore? Was it still public if you were outside your house, even though nobody else was around for several miles in all directions? Tall buildings and concrete streets surrounded him, with the odd car parked on the side here and there. Shinji passed restaurants, shopping malls, grocery stores, movie theaters, many office buildings, and even a municipal building which he suspected to be the town hall.  
驾车兜了一会儿风后，他下了车，决定四处走走以消磨时间。如今每次走在街上，总有一种奇异的感觉。这里还能算是公共场所吗？如果你身处户外，尽管方圆数英里内空无一人，这还算得上是公共场所吗？高耸的建筑物和混凝土街道环绕着他，偶尔可见路边停放的车辆。真嗣经过餐馆、购物中心、杂货店、电影院、众多办公楼，甚至还有一座他猜测是市政厅的市政大楼。

After walking around for a while though, he started growing bored. He wasn't sure how much time had passed since he had left Asuka at home, but either way, he didn't feel like staying out any longer.  
然而，转悠了一会儿后，他开始感到无聊。他不记得自己离开在家等他的明日香已经多久了，但无论如何，他不想再在外面逗留了。

Taking a different route back to his truck, he rounded a corner, and stopped as he saw two rather large office buildings side by side. Though it hadn't even been a day since he had perfected the ability, Shinji was still curious about this. The practicality made it more feasible to be used in situations more similar to this, so while he was here, he may as was well try it. The tree was afterall only about five stories tall.  
他换了一条路线返回卡车，转过一个拐角，突然停下脚步，因为他看到了两座并排的巨大办公楼。尽管他才刚刚掌握这项能力不到一天，但真嗣对此仍充满好奇。在类似这种情境下，其实用性使得它更加可行，所以既然他在这里，不妨试试看。毕竟那棵树也只有五层楼高。

Finding a suitable spot, Shinji tested the ground under his feet, before placing strength into his legs, and then lifted himself off the ground. He shot immediately upward between the two office buildings. They seemed to be part of the same complex, and both were about the same height, though near the top, the paneled glass exterior slanted at an angle similar to a triangle, before dropping straight down. Shinji repeatedly used his AT-field as a spring board whenever his momentum dropped. He knew how to time it perfectly now, and knew just how long the projection would take. This was still easy though, so Shinji decided to create a few variables in his mind.  
找到一个合适的地点后，真嗣先试了试脚下的地面，然后将力量注入双腿，随即一跃而起。他瞬间冲向两座办公楼之间的空中。这两座楼似乎属于同一建筑群，高度也相近，但在接近顶部时，镶嵌玻璃的外墙以类似三角形的斜度倾斜，然后垂直下落。每当势头减弱时，真嗣便反复利用 AT 力场作为弹跳板。他现在已经能完美掌握时机，也清楚投影所需的时间。尽管这仍然很简单，但真嗣决定在脑海中加入一些变量。

Imagining what he would, he started jumping around within the open space as he continued rising. He created platforms faster and faster as his momentum changed, and his bodies position changed. Twisting his body in the air, so that he was he was looking down at the ground, he quickly created a platform and pushed his legs off against it. He immediately flew towards the other building, his body almost crashing into the window pane before he spun in the air again, and created another platform to jump off of.  
想象着自己将要做什么，他开始在开阔的空间内不断跳跃上升。随着动量的变化和身体位置的改变，他创造平台越来越快。在空中扭转身体，以便俯视地面，他迅速创造出一个平台并用双腿蹬离。他立刻飞向另一座建筑，身体几乎要撞上窗玻璃，但在空中再次旋转，创造出另一个平台跳离。

Shinji continued doing this until he reached the top of the triangular slope. There was a small gap at the edge that allowed Shinji to sit, almost perched on the edge and look down at the city below. He was a little more than twenty stories up now, and could even see downtown Kyoto if he tilted his head to the right. He had seen a view similar to this earlier when he had done the same to reach the top of the tree, but this was on a much grander level. With the city stretched out in front of him, Shinji couldn't help but smile. His AT-field had its uses afterall, but this was for fun more than anything. He seriously doubted he'd ever have to use it for something like this.  
真嗣继续这样做，直到他到达三角形斜坡的顶部。边缘有一个小缝隙，让真嗣可以坐下，几乎像是栖息在边缘，俯瞰下面的城市。他现在离地面有二十多层楼高，如果他向右倾斜头部，甚至可以看到京都市中心。之前他爬到树顶时也见过类似的景色，但这次规模更大。面对着展现在他面前的城市，真嗣忍不住微笑。他的 AT 力场毕竟有它的用处，但这更多是为了乐趣。他严重怀疑自己是否真的需要用它来做这样的事情。

Deciding that he may as well begin his decent, he peered over the edge, his feet dangling over the side. There was a feeling of vertigo, but also a certain thrill that Shinji felt as he looked over the edge. To anybody that didn't understand what he was doing, they may think imminent suicide was the most obvious outcome. Shinji smirked slightly, and then pushed himself off from his sitting position.  
决定开始下坡，他俯视着边缘，双脚悬在边上。有一种眩晕感，但也伴随着一种刺激感，真嗣在俯视边缘时感受到了。对于不了解他在做什么的人来说，他们可能会认为最明显的结果是即将自杀。真嗣微微一笑，然后从坐姿中推开自己。

The wind rushed against his face, pressing against him far faster than when he had been ascending. From free fall though, twenty stories wasn't very far, and Shinji already had experience injuring himself if he didn't time the fall right. Climbing was always easier than descending.  
风猛烈地扑打在他的脸上，以远超他上升时的速度压迫着他。但从自由落体来看，二十层楼并不算太高，而且真嗣已经有经验，如果他没把握好落下的时机，就会受伤。攀爬总是比下降容易。

Twisting his body around, he created a platform within a fraction of a second, and bounded off of it, creating wind resistance as his body slowed itself down from suddenly altering the direction. A normal human body would have been pounded by the sudden change in force, but Shinji bore it easily. He slowed himself down, altering his direction using his AT-field and his own two feet, creating enough force to slow his fall.  
他扭动身体，在一瞬间内创造出一个平台，然后从上面跳开，利用风阻使身体减速，突然改变方向。一个普通人的身体可能会被这突如其来的力量冲击，但真嗣轻松承受住了。他利用 AT 力场和自己的双脚改变方向，产生足够的力道来减缓下落速度。

As he passed the five story mark, he stopped worrying about changing his direction now that he had slowed himself down considerably, and contended with creating the occasional platform. He still had to be careful with the timing though, as one false projection could screw everything up. Concentration and timing was what he had gathered from his practice, and while it was considerably better, he still hadn't reached the unconscious thought, and still required the use of his right arm every time he projected his AT-field.  
当他经过五层楼的高度时，他不再担心改变方向，因为他已经大大减缓了自己的速度，并开始专注于偶尔创造平台。尽管如此，他仍然必须小心计时，因为一次错误的投影可能会毁掉一切。从练习中他总结出，专注和时机是关键，虽然现在有所改善，但他仍未达到无意识思考的境界，每次投影 AT 力场时仍需使用右臂。

Shinji lightly touched down on a spot not far from where he had started, decreasing his speed to a point that the impact was hardly felt. Looking up at the buildings above him, he had to shield his eyes from the sun to see how far he had just come. It was one thing to do that in a dense forest, but another thing entirely to do this in a once populated area. Shinji couldn't help but grin, wondering what somebody who was just passing by would think if they had seen this supernatural happenstance. Be that as it may, the only person that would likely ever see this was Asuka, and Shinji highly doubted she'd ever see it either.  
真嗣轻轻降落在他起始点不远处，减缓速度以至于落地时几乎感觉不到冲击。抬头望向头顶的建筑物，他不得不遮住眼睛以避开阳光，看看自己刚刚飞了多远。在密集的森林中这样做是一回事，但在曾经人口密集的地区则是另一回事。真嗣忍不住笑了，想知道如果有人恰好路过看到这种超自然现象会怎么想。尽管如此，唯一可能看到这一幕的人只有明日香，而真嗣高度怀疑她是否也会看到。

Taking his time, he wandered back to his truck, thinking that enough time had probably passed now. The sun was in the midst of setting afterall.  
他不慌不忙地漫步回到自己的卡车旁，心想现在时间应该已经足够了。毕竟，太阳正处在落山的过程中。

Shinji still took his time as he drove home, hardly pushing the car over forty-five, and unknowingly, obeying the traffic speeds on the highway. He hoped that Asuka was done by now with whatever she had planned, though even if she wasn't, Shinji didn't think he could waste several more hours. He had already reached his limit, and he had wanted to spend as much time with Asuka today, which was turning out to be quite the opposite of what he had intended.  
真嗣依然不紧不慢地开车回家，几乎没有将车速推到四十五以上，不知不觉中，他遵守着高速公路上的限速。他希望明日香现在已经完成了她计划的事情，尽管即使她还没完成，真嗣也不认为自己还能再浪费几个小时。他已经达到了极限，而且他原本想今天尽可能多地和明日香在一起，结果却与他的初衷大相径庭。

Driving through the small town, he took the familiar path back home, and minutes later, pulled into the driveway in front of the their garage. He almost half expected Asuka to come running from the patio, declaring that he was back far too soon and that he needed to turn right around again. No such thing happened, but Shinji sorta wished she would have at least come out to greet him.  
驾车穿过小镇，他沿着熟悉的路线回家，几分钟后，他把车停在了车库前的车道上。他几乎半期待着明日香会从露台上跑出来，宣称他回来得太早，需要立刻再出发。但这样的事情并没有发生，不过真嗣有点希望她至少能出来迎接他。

Stepping out of his truck, he walked around the side of the house, and opened the sliding door. A wide range of aromas assaulted his nostrils, none of which he could accurately place. Thinking it a bit early to start dinner, he glanced over at the kitchen, but was surprised to see each countertop strewn with an odd assortment of things. Shinji was about to walk over and examine things closer though, when he heard a low moan coming from the couch.  
从卡车里走出来，他绕到房子的一侧，打开了滑动门。一股混合的香气扑鼻而来，他却无法准确辨认出任何一种。心想晚餐时间似乎还早，他瞥向厨房，却惊讶地发现每个台面上都散落着各种奇怪的东西。正要走过去仔细查看时，他听到了沙发处传来的一声低吟。

Asuka was laying there, her legs drawn of towards her chest and her face tilted towards the fireplace. She was sleeping, though it seemed to be rather fitful. Shinji watched her for several seconds, kneeling beside her, and gazing into her face. This wasn't the first time he had done this, and neither would it be the last, but Shinji suddenly leaned in and kissed her as she slept.  
明日香躺在那里，双腿蜷缩向胸前，脸庞朝向壁炉。她在睡觉，但看起来睡得并不安稳。真嗣跪在她身旁，凝视着她的脸，几秒钟过去了。这不是他第一次这样做，也不会是最后一次，但真嗣突然俯身在她熟睡时吻了她。

Whatever she had been dreaming about, was quickly turned aside as Asuka's eyes flew wide open, and for one moment, Shinji thought that she would pushed him away, but she instead kissed him back ferociously, grabbing the collar of his shirt and pulling him onto the couch. Shinji hadn't quite expected this reaction, as Asuka was usually more annoyed with him waking her up in such a manner, but it appeared she was eager to see him as well.  
无论她之前梦见了什么，此刻都被迅速抛诸脑后，因为明日香的双眼猛地睁大，有那么一瞬间，真嗣以为她会推开他，但她却反而激烈地回吻起来，抓住他的衬衫领口，将他拽倒在沙发上。真嗣并未料到这样的反应，毕竟明日香通常会因为他以这种方式唤醒她而感到恼火，但看来她也很渴望见到他。

They fell into a daze as they kissed each other, but something must have reminded Asuka of what she had been doing before she fell asleep, because she suddenly pushed Shinji off her, and sat bolt upright, her eyes darting over to the kitchen.  
他们在亲吻中陷入恍惚，但某件事一定提醒了明日香她入睡前的行为，因为她突然将真嗣推开，笔直地坐起身来，目光迅速扫向厨房。

"God damn it!" Asuka swore rather loudly.  
“该死！”明日香大声咒骂道。

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

"Shinji, go upstairs. Now!"  
"真嗣，上楼去。现在！"

Shinji didn't need to be told twice, not when Asuka's tone was that serious. Scrambling upstairs, he could already hear the grumbling coming from Asuka as she marched into the kitchen, and the distinct scrape of plates and pans as they were moved around the kitchen. Shinji could only surmise that whatever she was doing, wasn't done, or it was, and that Shinji had almost seen something he shouldn't have.  
真嗣不需要被提醒两次，尤其是当明日香的语气如此严肃时。他急忙上楼，已经能听到明日香走进厨房时的咕哝声，以及厨房里盘子和锅具被挪动的清晰声响。真嗣只能推测，无论她在做什么，要么还没完成，要么已经完成了，而真嗣差点看到了不该看的东西。

---

Shinji attempted to keep himself occupied while upstairs, but after twenty minutes of nothing to do, he calmly walked downstairs and entered the study, searching for something to read. While he was doing this, Asuka came up behind him and handed him the book that he had been reading earlier. It had been left in the living room, so Shinji assumed that was far too close to the kitchen, but Asuka was taking pity on him it seemed.  
真嗣试图让自己在上楼时保持忙碌，但二十分钟无所事事之后，他平静地走下楼，进入书房，寻找一些可读的东西。正当他这么做时，明日香从他身后走来，递给他之前在读的那本书。书被遗留在客厅，真嗣以为那离厨房太近了，但看来明日香是在同情他。

"How much longer is this going to take?" voiced Shinji after Asuka had handed him the book.  
“这还要多久？”真嗣在明日香递给他书后问道。

"As long as it does," replied Asuka as she turned away from him, her snappish attitude resurfacing for a brief moment.  
“该多久就多久，”明日香回答，转身离开他，她那急躁的态度短暂地再次浮现。

So, Shinji was stuck reading upstairs, his back resting against the headboard of their bed, and his legs drawn up in front of him. He was glad it was a paperback, so he could read with one hand if he wanted to, but he was constantly setting the book aside, and listening for any noise downstairs. Asuka may be frustrated over what she was dong, but she was careful at the very least, not letting anything drift upstairs for Shinji's ears.  
于是，真嗣只能待在楼上读书，背靠床头板，双腿蜷缩在身前。幸好是平装本，他想用一只手读也行，但他总是把书搁到一边，留心听着楼下的动静。明日香或许对她正在做的事情感到沮丧，但至少她很小心，不让任何声音飘到楼上让真嗣听见。

When it was becoming far too difficult for Shinji to handle, and with the sun fast setting, he was about to go downstairs against Asuka's wishes, when he heard the slow footfalls of someone coming upstairs. He saw her before they spoke, as Asuka's figure appeared in the hallway, walking towards the bedroom. She didn't say anything as she entered, but just collapsed on the bed, forcing Shinji to move his feet out of the way.  
当真嗣觉得越来越难以忍受，而太阳也迅速西沉时，他正准备违背明日香的意愿下楼去，这时他听到了有人缓缓上楼的脚步声。在他们说话之前，他就看到了她，明日香的身形出现在走廊里，朝卧室走来。她走进来时什么也没说，只是倒在床上，迫使真嗣把脚挪开。

"You alright?" asked Shinji, slightly worried about her.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道，略微担心她。

"Uhhh," was all that Asuka could reply with.  
"呃," 这就是明日香能回答的全部了。

Shinji placed the book on the nightstand beside him, and then sat up, crawling across the bed to sit beside Asuka. He slowly rubbed her back, since she was laying on her stomach, but she didn't say anything, only letting out a small groan.  
真嗣把书放在他旁边的床头柜上，然后坐起身，爬过床坐在明日香旁边。他慢慢地揉着她的背，因为她趴着，但她什么也没说，只是发出了一声轻微的呻吟。

"So, did you get everything done?"  
"那么，你把所有事情都完成了吗？"

"...Sorta," was all Asuka replied with.  
"...算是吧," 明日香只这么回答道。

She sat up though, because they didn't have any time to waste. Grabbing Shinji's hand, she tugged him off the bed, ignoring the protests that he flung in her direction. They were running on limited time, and Asuka was not about to let her efforts be in vain.  
但她还是坐了起来，因为他们没有时间可以浪费。她抓住真嗣的手，拉着他离开床铺，无视他发出的抗议。他们的时间有限，明日香绝不允许自己的努力白费。

When they entered the living room, Shinji saw something that he had not expected to see. Both of their camping backpacks from months ago were placed next to the sliding door, and something else which Shinji could only imagine bore the bulk of Asuka's frustration. Just seeing it, Shinji could guess how difficult it was to put together. When he turned to Asuka to ask about this though, she just shushed him, and handed his own camping backpack to him. It was light, but there was unmistakably something inside. Slinging her own over her shoulders, and then grabbing the basket beside her, she took his hand and walked outside.  
当他们走进客厅时，真嗣看到了一件他未曾预料到的景象。几个月前的两个露营背包被放在滑动门旁，还有一件东西，真嗣只能想象它承载了明日香大部分的怒气。光是看到它，真嗣就能猜到组装起来有多困难。当他转向明日香想询问时，她只是嘘了一声，并递给他自己的露营背包。虽然很轻，但里面显然装了东西。她把自己的背包甩到肩上，然后抓起旁边的篮子，牵着他的手走了出去。

Asuka led the way, but as they started walking in a familiar direction, Shinji began to understand what she had thought. They didn't come down this way very often, but they had kept it well tended for the most part, thanks to Shinji's AT-field. It was just a matter of trimming back the brush, and making sure the grass didn't grow very high. Even so, with the sun almost gone, walking through the dense forest was like trying to walk through an underground cave, but Asuka had thankfully thought to bring a flashlight. Though it was almost night, the air wasn't cool, but still fairly warm.  
明日香领路在前，但随着他们开始朝熟悉的方向行进，真嗣逐渐明白了她的想法。他们并不常走这条路，但多亏了真嗣的 AT 力场，大部分时间都维护得很好。只需修剪一下灌木，确保草不会长得太高。即便如此，随着太阳几乎消失，穿越茂密的森林就像试图穿越地下洞穴，但幸运的是，明日香想到了带上手电筒。尽管夜幕降临，空气并不凉爽，依然相当温暖。

They didn't talk to each other, but Asuka continued holding Shinji's hand as they walked. She wasn't afraid of losing him in the dark, but the extra warmth of his hand kept her reassured.  
他们没有交谈，但明日香继续握着真嗣的手前行。她并不担心在黑暗中失去他，但他的手带来的额外温暖让她感到安心。

Eventually, they broke through the group of trees, and stepped into the field. It was nearly twilight, and the green grass was just barely visible in the disappearing light. Asuka frowned, wishing that she hadn't fallen asleep earlier, since they'd have more light if she had gotten done sooner, but that was also why she had decided to bring both the backpacks.  
最终，他们穿过了树丛，踏入了田野。已是黄昏时分，绿草在逐渐消失的光线中隐约可见。明日香皱起眉头，后悔之前睡过头了，如果她早点完成，他们会有更多的光线，但这也是她决定带上两个背包的原因。

Letting go of Shinji's hand, Asuka placed the basket on the grass, and then unslung her pack, going through its content. Shinji didn't say anything to her, his eyes fixed on the sky above them. The stars were already starting to come out, and he could see the distinct line of the Milky Way galaxy above them that was sometimes visible on clear nights. Turning his attention to Asuka, he saw what she had been rummaging around for.  
放开真嗣的手，明日香将篮子放在草地上，然后卸下背包，翻找里面的东西。真嗣没有对她说什么，他的目光凝视着头顶的天空。星星已经开始闪现，他能看到银河系那条有时在晴朗夜晚清晰可见的明显线条。转而看向明日香，他发现她一直在寻找的东西。

She had pulled out some scraps of paper, and a couple of small stones, which she placed in a ring. Walking back to the edge of the forest, she gathered some dry leaves and small branches, placing them in the ring of stones. Dumping the paper on the stack, she pulled some matches out of a pocket in her backpack, and lit the paper. It immediately caught, the fire licking the leaves and branches until the fire was threatening to spill out of the ring of stones. The dry grass underneath it was immediately charred black, and Asuka had to be careful not to let the fire spread any further.  
她拿出一些碎纸片和几块小石头，摆成一个圈。走回森林边缘，她收集了一些干树叶和小树枝，放在石头圈里。将纸片倒在堆上，她从背包的口袋里掏出一些火柴，点燃了纸片。火立刻燃起，舔舐着树叶和树枝，直到火势似乎要溢出石头圈。下面的干草立刻被烧成黑色，明日香不得不小心不让火势蔓延。

When she felt it was satisfactory, she motioned to Shinji to pass his backpack to him. Shinji did so without question, and Asuka pulled out a bundle of blankets, one of which she placed on the ground, spreading it out so at least four people could easily sit on it without spilling onto the grass. The others she placed off to the side for now.  
当她觉得满意时，她示意真嗣把他的背包递给她。真嗣毫不犹豫地照做了，而明日香从背包里拿出了一捆毯子，其中一条她铺在地上，展开后足够四个人轻松坐下而不至于滑到草地上。其他的她暂时放在一边。

Finishing with these preparations, Asuka finally grabbed the basket and placed it beside her. Letting out a low sigh, she glanced over at Shinji and then motioned for him to sit next to her. Shinji did so with hesitation, and was about to say something, when Asuka interrupted him.  
完成这些准备工作后，明日香终于拿起篮子，放在她旁边。她轻轻叹了口气，瞥了一眼真嗣，然后示意他坐在她旁边。真嗣犹豫了一下，坐了下来，正要开口说什么，却被明日香打断了。

"Don't say anything. I'm in charge here."  
“什么也别说。这里我说了算。”

Shinji swallowed what he had been about to say, but nodded all the same.  
真嗣咽下了原本要说的话，但还是点了点头。

Slowly, Asuka began passing him things. Shinji had no idea how much she put into the moderately sized basket, but the rice itself probably filled the very bottom of the basket at least. It was sealed in a plastic container, neatly packed inside, and sprinkled with a very minute amount of garlic. They ate it together, shared between them using the utensils that Asuka had provided, while the fire continued roaring in front of them.  
慢慢地，明日香开始递给他东西。真嗣不知道她往那个中等大小的篮子里放了多少，但至少那盒米饭可能已经填满了篮子的底部。它被密封在一个塑料容器里，整齐地包装在内，并撒上了一点点大蒜。他们一起吃着，用明日香提供的餐具分享，而火在他们面前继续熊熊燃烧。

After the rice, Asuka continued bringing more thinks out. Now that Shinji saw everything, it was obvious that Asuka had tried to create a picnic of sorts, but there were obvious things that she couldn't simply work around, so she had created something herself. Canned vegetables had been sautéed in a manner of ways, creating something that you'd never guess had come from a can. A rich soup, hand craft by Asuka, was so strong that Shinji had to reach for a cup of tea more than once. The soup and tea were supplied by large thermoses for each, and Shinji wondered where Asuka had found them, since he had certainly never seen them in their house before.

Shinji was always glad whenever Asuka decided to cook, since it gave him a break, but their was also something else. Knowing that she specifically was thinking of him while she cooked, and in particular, this meal, always brought a smile to his face.  
每当明日香决定做饭时，真嗣总是感到高兴，因为这让他得以休息，但还有别的原因。知道她做饭时特别想着他，尤其是这顿饭，总是让他脸上露出微笑。

When the different food sources started to taper off, and Asuka was beginning to pack everything back in the basket, Shinji fell onto his back, and placed his hands behind his head, looking up at the sky. The stars were almost fully in bloom above him in the night sky now, and the moon was just started to shed some light onto the field where he lay. It was a wonderful night Shinji thought.  
当不同的食物来源开始减少，明日香开始将所有东西重新装回篮子时，真嗣仰面躺下，双手枕在脑后，仰望着天空。星星几乎完全在夜空中绽放，月亮也开始将一些光芒洒在他躺着的田野上。真嗣觉得这是一个美妙的夜晚。

Wordlessly, he heard rustling coming from Asuka's direction, and glanced over at her. She was finished packing everything back into the basket, and was now gathering up the blankets she had tossed to the side earlier. Nudging her way over to Shinji, she grabbed one of the larger blankets, and tossed it over himself, before laying down beside him, and crawling under the blanket as well.  
他默默地听到明日香那边传来窸窣声，便瞥向她。她已经把所有东西重新装回篮子，现在正收拾起之前扔到一边的毯子。她轻轻挪到真嗣身边，拿起一条较大的毯子，扔在他身上，然后躺在他旁边，也钻进了毯子下。

"Asuka, thanks for this," said Shinji as he continued to look at her. "It was a nice change of pace from what we've been doing recently. Just laying out here, I feel relaxed."  
“明日香，谢谢你这么做，”真嗣继续看着她说道，“这和我们最近做的事情相比，真是让人心情舒畅。只是躺在这里，我就感到放松。”

Asuka didn't say anything. She was looking up the sky, but there seemed to be something on her mind. Noticing this, Shinji propped himself on one arm to get a better look at her and asked, "Something wrong Asuka?"  
明日香没有说话。她仰望着天空，但似乎心事重重。注意到这一点，真嗣用一只手臂撑起自己，以便更好地观察她，并问道：“有什么不对劲吗，明日香？”

Again, she didn't say anything, but she did react. Slowly turning towards him, Asuka placed her hand on Shinji's chest, and pushed him onto his back. Dragging the blanket with her, Asuka mounted Shinji, and then leaned into his chest, resting her entire body on his.  
她再次沉默，但确实有了反应。明日香缓缓转向他，将手放在真嗣的胸前，将他推倒。她拽着毯子，跨坐在真嗣身上，然后俯身贴近他的胸膛，全身倚靠在他身上。

"Asuka?" wondered Shinji.  
"明日香？" 真嗣疑惑道。

"...Like I said, I'm in charge right now," mumbled Asuka, before she tilted her head upwards and kissed him.  
"……就像我说的，现在我负责，" 明日香咕哝着，然后她抬起头，吻了他。

Shinji had rather expected this, but not in a position like this. He could feel Asuka's warm body pressing against his own, her waist against his, her breasts pressing against his chest, and then he felt a reaction from his own waist.  
真嗣对此有所预料，但没想到会是在这样的情况下。他能感受到明日香温暖的身躯紧贴着自己，她的腰抵着他的，她的胸部压在他的胸膛上，接着他感到自己腰部有了反应。

'Not now,' thought Shinji, but Asuka just continued kissing him, not caring about the thing poking against her hips. Besides, Asuka was feeling aroused as well.  
"'现在不行，' 真嗣心想，但明日香只是继续吻着他，不在乎那抵在她腰间的东西。而且，明日香也感到兴奋。

While she continued kissing him, Asuka ran her hands along Shinji chest. Shinji was tall, though rather skinny, but Asuka could still feel his muscles. She wondered whether this was from his natural body's composition, or if the months of chopping firewood had finally bulked him up a bit. Neither really matter, but Asuka did enjoy the feel.  
"在她继续吻他的同时，明日香用手抚摸着真嗣的胸膛。真嗣虽然高，但相当瘦，不过明日香仍能感受到他的肌肉。她想知道这是他天生的体格，还是几个月砍柴终于让他壮实了一些。其实这些都不重要，但明日香确实喜欢这种感觉。

Asuka played with the hem of his shirt, and his collar. She was debating on something, but not sure whether she wanted to take another step. Shinji didn't have any clue, and just continued kissing her as they lay with each other. Taking the initiative, Shinji's tongue entered Asuka's mouth, kissing her deeply, and for a moment, Asuka completely forgot what she was attempting to do, loosing herself entirely in the kiss. Around them, small animals began to roam the night, but both were oblivious to this.  
"明日香摆弄着他的衬衫下摆和衣领。她在考虑某件事，但不确定是否要迈出下一步。真嗣毫无头绪，只是继续与她相拥而吻。真嗣主动出击，舌头探入明日香的口中，深情地吻着她，一时间，明日香完全忘记了她原本打算做什么，完全沉浸在这个吻中。周围，小动物开始在夜晚游荡，但两人对此浑然不觉。

Breaking off the kiss momentarily, Asuka drew back from Shinji, sitting on his waist and looking down at him. She was biting her lip seductively, her body silhouetted against the fire behind her. Shinji nearly gave into his animals instincts, and probably would have pushed her down if Asuka hadn't moved. Leaning back down towards Shinji, he expected her to continue kissing him, but instead, she attacked from a different angle.  
暂时中断亲吻，明日香从真嗣身上退开，坐在他的腰间俯视着他。她性感地咬着嘴唇，身体在背后的火焰映衬下形成剪影。真嗣几乎要屈服于自己的本能冲动，如果不是明日香先动了的话，他可能已经把她推倒了。她再次俯身向真嗣，他以为她会继续亲吻他，但她却从另一个角度发起了攻势。

Her hands grabbed the hem of his shirt, and began pulling it up over his head. Shinji started at this, but Asuka sealed his muted reply with a sudden forceful kiss, her tongue immediately entwining with his. Whatever protest Shinji was about to make melted away, being replaced by eagerness. Breaking off the kiss, Shinji let Asuka remove his shirt the rest of the way so that his chest was bare. Asuka looked down at Shinji's chest unsure exactly what she was doing. She had seen his bare chest plenty of times by now, but this was the first time she was ever this close. Placing her hand on his skin, she felt Shinji shiver at her touch, and thought she felt him grow even harder at the waist. Asuka wasn't sure how far she wanted to take this.  
她的双手抓住他衬衫的下摆，开始向上拉过他的头顶。真嗣对此感到惊讶，但明日香用一个突然而有力的吻封住了他未出口的回应，她的舌头立刻与他缠绕在一起。真嗣原本要提出的任何抗议都消融了，取而代之的是急切。中断亲吻后，真嗣让明日香继续脱掉他的衬衫，直到他的胸膛裸露出来。明日香低头看着真嗣的胸膛，不太确定自己在做什么。她现在已经多次见过他的裸胸，但这是她第一次如此近距离地接触。她把手放在他的皮肤上，感觉到真嗣因她的触摸而颤抖，她甚至觉得他的腰部变得更硬了。明日香不确定她想把这件事做到什么程度。

Running her hands along his chest, she traced out the groves of his ribcage, following up to his collarbone, and then to his shoulder. Shinji squirmed immensely as she did this, and even more so when Asuka's silky hair brushed against his skin. She was certainly teasing him now, but Shinji didn't have the means of retaliating right now.  
她用手沿着他的胸膛滑过，描绘着他肋骨的轮廓，一路向上至锁骨，再到肩膀。真嗣在这过程中极力扭动着身体，当明日香柔滑的发丝拂过他的肌肤时，他更是如此。她现在显然是在挑逗他，但真嗣此刻却无力反击。

Asuka continued exploring Shinji's upper body, not leaving any part of it untouched. Whenever Shinji was about to voice his thoughts, Asuka would silence him with a quick kiss, to which Shinji would lapse back into a daze. It was hard for him to believe that Asuka was doing this right now, but she had wanted this it seemed.  
明日香继续探索着真嗣的上半身，不放过任何一个部位。每当真嗣想要表达自己的想法时，明日香就会用一个快速的吻让他安静下来，真嗣随即又陷入恍惚之中。他很难相信明日香此刻正在这样做，但似乎她确实渴望如此。

Seeming to be done with her exploration, Asuka let out a deep sigh. She didn't want to admit it, but she was aroused just by being this near to Shinji. Her hands against his chest, his body heat against her own; everything was making Asuka's body excited. She tried ignoring a certain wetness that was spreading between her legs, but this was a sure sign of her arousal. If she took another step, she wasn't sure what would happen.  
似乎完成了她的探索，明日香深深地叹了口气。她不想承认，但仅仅是靠近真嗣就让她感到兴奋。她的手贴在他的胸膛上，他的体温与她自己的交融；一切都让明日香的身体感到兴奋。她试图忽视双腿间逐渐蔓延的湿润感，但这无疑是她兴奋的明确迹象。如果她再进一步，她不确定会发生什么。

"Asuka, you alright?" asked Shinji.  
“Asuka，你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

Shinji asked this because Asuka had stopped what she was doing, but was sitting silently on Shinji's lap for a good minute now. She was looking at him, but at the same time, she wasn't, contemplating something in her own mind.  
真嗣这样问是因为 Asuka 突然停下了手头的事情，已经静静地坐在真嗣的腿上有一分钟了。她看着他，却又似乎没在看他，心里在想着什么。

"Sorry...what?" mumbled Asuka.  
“抱歉……你说什么？”Asuka 含糊地回应。

Shinji frowned, but then sat up to get a better look at her, the resulting shift in body position making Asuka inhale suddenly. They were inches away from each other now, with Asuka still sitting in Shinji's lap. Asuka bit her lip, but in was in frustration now. She didn't know what she wanted at this point. She wanted to continue, but was unsure.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，但还是坐起身来，以便更清楚地看向她，这一动作使得坐在他腿上的明日香突然深吸了一口气。他们现在相距仅几英寸，明日香依然坐在真嗣的腿上。明日香咬了咬嘴唇，但这次是出于沮丧。她此刻也不知道自己想要什么。她想继续，却又犹豫不决。

"Asuka...if you want to stop, I understand."  
“明日香……如果你想停下来，我理解。”

Asuka didn't meet his gaze, but looked away, her face a mixture of frustration and longing. They couldn't go all the way, that much was certain, but Asuka had hoped for more.  
明日香没有直视他的目光，而是转过头去，脸上混杂着沮丧与渴望。他们不能做到最后，这一点是肯定的，但明日香曾希望有更多的进展。

Shinji continued watching the different emotions Asuka was battling with. Shinji was still bare chested, but he hardly seemed to notice. His eyes were transfixed on Asuka. Whatever Shinji wanted was null void unless he heard something from Asuka.  
真嗣继续观察着明日香正在与之斗争的各种情绪。真嗣仍然赤裸着上身，但他似乎并未察觉。他的目光紧紧锁定在明日香身上。无论真嗣想要什么，除非他听到明日香的话，否则都毫无意义。

"...Hey Shinji? asked Asuka in a weak voice.  
“……嘿，真嗣？”明日香用微弱的声音问道。

"...Yes?" “……嗯？”

"...Hold me." "...抱紧我。"

Shinji did so, with any hesitation, wrapping his arms around Asuka, and held her to his bare chest. Shinji didn't know what else she wanted, but at the very least, he could do this.  
真嗣毫不犹豫地照做了，双臂环绕着明日香，将她拥入自己赤裸的胸膛。真嗣虽不清楚她还需要什么，但至少，他可以做到这一点。

Asuka's hands were at her side, and she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with them. She could easily hold Shinji as well, but she didn't think this was it. She wanted more, she wanted what she had done for Shinji.  
明日香的手垂在身侧，她不确定自己想用它们做什么。她完全可以同样抱住真嗣，但她觉得这并非她所渴望的。她想要更多，她想要为真嗣做过的那种感觉。

Slowly, she moved her hands, and then placed them on Shinji's arm, grasping him slightly. Asuka directed his arms away from her back slowly. Shinji was only following, not having a clue what Asuka was doing. Asuka searched Shinji's eyes for any sign of expectance, though all she could see was puzzlement. It wasn't surprising that he didn't understand what Asuka was about to do.  
她缓缓移动双手，然后轻轻搭在真嗣的手臂上，稍稍握住。明日香慢慢引导他的手臂离开她的背部。真嗣只是顺从地跟随，完全不明白明日香在做什么。明日香在真嗣的眼中寻找着期待的迹象，但她看到的只有困惑。他不懂明日香即将要做的事，这并不令人意外。

Letting out her worries in a deep exhale, Asuka directed Shinji's hands to her waist, and then slowly up her bare back. At first, Shinji didn't realize what Asuka was doing, or telling him silently. Shinji's hands were gliding across her skin, the fabric of her shirt brushing against his knuckles. Asuka let go of Shinji's hands, and they began to move on their own. Asuka shivered at his touch, scrunching her face up, but this was when Shinji kissed her. The kiss had been hesitant, but Asuka replied with force, pushing Shinji back to the ground.  
明日香深吸一口气，将心中的忧虑释放出来，她引导真嗣的手放在她的腰间，然后缓缓向上滑过她裸露的背部。起初，真嗣并未意识到明日香在做什么，或是无声地告诉他什么。他的手在她肌肤上滑行，衬衫的布料轻拂过他的指节。明日香松开了真嗣的手，它们开始自行移动。明日香的身子因他的触碰而微微颤抖，她皱起眉头，但就在这时，真嗣吻了她。那个吻带着犹豫，但明日香以力量回应，将真嗣推倒在地。

Shinji's hands were now halfway along Asuka's back, her shirt pushed up, exposing her waist and lower back. With every touch and caress, Asuka shivered, her body squirming with pleasure and ecstasy. Shinji was far better than Asuka would have thought, and small moans began leaking out of her mouth, all of which were quickly silenced by a kiss. Shinji was careful though as he ran his hands along her back, his hands skipping several times across the clasp to her bra. Her shirt was hiked up far enough for him see her bra if he desired, but the last thing he need was for the clasp to unhook because of his carelessness. It would be a pleasant sight, but his consciousness would likely disappear afterwards.  
真嗣的手已经沿着明日香的后背滑到了一半，她的衬衫被推起，露出了腰际和下背部。每一次触碰和抚摸，明日香都会颤抖，身体因愉悦和狂喜而扭动。真嗣的表现远超明日香的预期，细微的呻吟开始从她口中逸出，随即被一个吻迅速封住。真嗣虽然小心翼翼地在她背上移动双手，但几次都避开了她胸罩的扣子。她的衬衫被推得足够高，如果他愿意，可以看到她的胸罩，但他最不需要的就是因为自己的疏忽而解开扣子。那将是一幅美妙的景象，但之后他的意识很可能会消失。

They became lost in the moment quickly, kissing each other and touching each other. Asuka began brushing her lips along his neck and biting at his ear, to which Shinji replied in turn, kissing Asuka's neck while his fingernails lightly traced themselves along her smooth back. This attack was far too much for Asuka, and Shinji was beginning to get new scars along his back thanks to Asuka's nails.  
他们很快沉浸在这一刻，彼此亲吻和触摸。明日香开始沿着他的脖子轻吻，并轻咬他的耳朵，真嗣则回应着，亲吻明日香的脖子，同时用指甲轻轻划过她光滑的背部。这对明日香来说太过强烈，真嗣的背上也开始因明日香的指甲而留下新的伤痕。

After what seemed like hours, they finally paused after a long kiss, and then Asuka sank onto Shinji's chest, panting wildly. Shinji was panting himself, which was nearly unheard of for him. Both of their bodies were slick with sweat, as though they had just run several miles. Though night had long set in, both were burning up with what felt like a fever, but it was just their bodies rubbing against one another.  
仿佛过了几个小时，他们终于在一次长吻后停了下来，随后明日香瘫倒在真嗣的胸膛上，气喘吁吁。真嗣也在喘息，这对他来说几乎是前所未闻的。两人的身体都汗流浃背，仿佛刚跑了好几英里。尽管夜幕早已降临，但他们都感觉像是在发高烧，其实只是身体相互摩擦所致。

Letting out a heavy sigh, Shinji ran his hands through his hair, wishing that he could take a cool swim to rinse the sweat off himself, but he didn't think he'd be getting up anytime soon. Asuka it seemed was nodding off, the exhaustion apparent on her face, and Shinji had to rouse her before she tilted her head up to look at him.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，用手梳理着头发，希望自己能跳进清凉的水中洗去汗水，但他觉得短时间内自己可能起不来。明日香似乎快要睡着了，脸上的疲惫显而易见，真嗣不得不唤醒她，她这才抬起头来看着他。

"Why did you do that? I was about to fall asleep."  
“你干嘛呀？我正要睡着呢。”

"It's a bit warm to be laying like this."  
“这样躺着有点热。”

Asuka frowned, but nodded in agreement. Sitting up, she pushed her shirt down, glancing over at Shinji, wondering if he had seen anything. Whether he did, he didn't comment, but Asuka supposed that even if he had, she wouldn't care. She was beyond caring about idiotic things like that at this point.  
明日香皱了皱眉，但还是点头同意。她坐起身，拉下衬衫，瞥了一眼真嗣，想知道他是否看到了什么。无论他是否看到，他都没有评论，但明日香想，即使他看到了，她也不在乎。到了这个地步，她已经不在乎那些愚蠢的事情了。

Throwing herself down on the ground next to Shinji, she wrapped herself snuggly in the blankets, and then turned to press herself against him. Shinji hadn't bothered to put his shirt back on, but Asuka didn't mind, and might have preferred it that way.  
她猛地扑倒在真嗣旁边的地上，紧紧裹上毯子，然后转身贴向他。真嗣没费心把衬衫穿回去，但明日香并不介意，甚至可能更喜欢这样。

They had pushed the boundaries further today, but there was still much unsaid. Asuka wasn't sure how she felt about this. She knew how she felt, and she knew how Shinji felt, so it was a simple matter of telling each other their feelings. That being said, for Asuka, it was easier showing, instead of telling.  
他们今天又突破了界限，但仍有许多未说出口的话。明日香不确定自己对此有何感受。她知道自己怎么想，也知道真嗣怎么想，所以问题就在于彼此坦白心意。话虽如此，对明日香来说，表达比说出口更容易。

"Thanks again for today Asuka," mumbled Shinji beside her.  
“今天谢谢你了，明日香。”真嗣在她身旁咕哝道。

Asuka grinned briefly, before she turned her eyes up towards him, and kissed him quickly.  
明日香短暂地笑了笑，然后抬起眼看着他，迅速地吻了他一下。

"You're welcome," smiled Asuka, before she curled herself up next to Shinji, and quickly fell asleep. Shinji fell asleep quickly as well, the fatigue from the night getting a hold of him. Kissing Asuka on the forehead, he thought he heard her mumble something in her sleep, but then shook his head, thinking that he misheard. Even had he heard right, he wanted to hear it from her while she was awake, and not asleep.  
“不客气。”明日香微笑着，随后蜷缩在真嗣身边，很快便进入了梦乡。真嗣也迅速入睡，夜晚的疲惫感紧紧抓住了他。他在明日香额头上轻轻一吻，心想自己似乎听到她在睡梦中喃喃自语，但随即摇了摇头，以为自己听错了。即便他真的听对了，他也希望在她清醒时亲耳听到，而不是在她睡着时。

Pressing his chin against her head, he fell asleep, while above them, the moon shined down on them, and the stars waited to usher in a new dawn.  
他将下巴抵在她的头顶，随即入睡，而他们上方，月亮洒下光辉，星星们静候着迎接新的一天的到来。

**Got this done a lot quicker than I had initially anticipated, so bit of a surprise update. Unlikely that I'll get another chapter done before the end of the month, but we'll see.  
比预期快了很多完成，所以算是意外更新。这个月结束前不太可能再完成一章了，但谁知道呢。**

"Aren't you done yet?" exclaimed Asuka while she leaned against the shopping cart inside the grocery store.  
“你还没好啊？”明日香在杂货店内的购物车旁斜靠着，大声问道。

"You're the one that suggested we stop here instead of taking food with us," sighed Shinji while he looked at the row of canned goods on the shelf.  
"是你建议我们在这里停下来而不是带上食物的，" 真嗣叹了口气，目光扫过货架上的一排罐头食品。

"I'm starting to wish that I didn't," grumbled Asuka.  
"我开始后悔这个提议了，" 明日香咕哝道。

"Well, I think this is the last of it anyway," said Shinji as he dumped a few cans into the cart.  
"嗯，我想这应该是最后一批了，" 真嗣说着，将几个罐头扔进了购物车。

"Good," said Asuka, seeming to brighten up considerably.  
“好，”明日香说道，似乎心情明显好转。

Pushing the shopping cart to the end of the isle, they performed one final cursory glance around the store, trying to decide whether they needed anything else. Neither could think of anything though, so they pushed the shopping cart towards the exit. When they stepped outside, Asuka couldn't help but shiver.  
他们将购物车推到过道的尽头，最后环顾了一下商店，试图决定是否还需要其他东西。但两人都想不出什么，于是便推着购物车向出口走去。当他们踏出店门时，明日香忍不住打了个寒颤。

Their vision was obscured by a flurry of white; winter had arrived at their doorstep. Powdery snow covered the parking lot of the grocery store in the small town that they inhabited, marred only by the tire tracks of their station wagon and truck, signifying the many times they had come down this way. It was early December, and though it had started snowing earlier this year, it wasn't nearly as bad as the winter they had spent back in Tokyo-2 where they had been snowed in for several days.  
他们的视线被一片白茫茫的景象所遮挡；冬天已经悄然降临。粉状的雪覆盖了他们居住的小镇上杂货店的停车场，只有他们的旅行车和卡车的轮胎痕迹破坏了这片洁白，标志着他们多次来到这里的痕迹。现在是十二月初，虽然今年雪下得比往年早，但远没有他们在东京-2 度过的那个冬天那么糟糕，那时他们被大雪困在家里好几天。

They were both bundled up for the cold, though Asuka had several more layers on, making her look like the abominable snowman. She was sporting a sweatshirt, and over this a jacket, with her hood drawn up, and mittens that covered her hands. Shinji was only wearing a sweatshirt with a hood, but Asuka had grown used to him not needing much to stay warm.  
尽管明日香穿了好几层衣服，看起来像个雪人，但他们都裹得严严实实的以抵御寒冷。她穿着一件运动衫，外面又套了一件夹克，帽子也拉了起来，手上还戴着连指手套。真嗣只穿了一件带帽子的运动衫，但明日香已经习惯了他不怎么需要保暖衣物就能保持温暖。

They packed the groceries into the back of the car, while Asuka began complaining about the cold, and Shinji kept silent. Hopefully, she wouldn't be doing this the entire time they were away.  
他们把买来的东西装进车后座，明日香开始抱怨寒冷，而真嗣则保持沉默。希望她在整个外出期间不会一直这样。

Stepping into the front seat, Asuka pulled off her gloves and then flexed her fingers multiple times before starting the car.  
明日香坐进驾驶座，脱下手套，然后多次活动手指，这才启动了汽车。

"You ready?" asked Asuka as she turned towards Shinji who sat beside her.  
"准备好了吗？" 明日香转向坐在她旁边的真嗣问道。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Alright, then lets get out of here!" said Asuka excitedly.  
"好，那我们离开这里吧！" 明日香兴奋地说道。

Throwing the car in reverse, she backed out of the lot, and onto main street, but instead of going up the hill to their house, she followed the road down to the highway, and then turned in the direction of Kyoto.  
她将车挂入倒挡，从停车场倒出，驶上主干道，但没有朝他们家的山坡方向行驶，而是沿着道路下到高速公路，然后转向京都的方向。

"Ah, I can't wait for this," grinned Asuka as she turned towards Shinji.  
“啊，我迫不及待了，”明日香笑着转向真嗣。

"I have to agree," smirked Shinji  
“我同意，”真嗣微微一笑。

---

It had started yesterday night. After dinner, both of them were sitting on the couch with the fire roaring in front of them, and a blanket shared between them. The initial excitement of the new snow had quickly faded away, and Asuka in particular was starting to grow increasingly frustrated with how cold it had gotten. Sure, there was an added bonus of being able to stay glued to each others side nearly every day, but they did this because of their feelings for each other, not because it was cold.  
这一切始于昨晚。晚饭后，两人坐在沙发上，面前是熊熊燃烧的炉火，一条毯子盖在两人之间。初雪带来的兴奋感很快消退，尤其是明日香，她开始对寒冷的天气感到越来越烦躁。当然，能够几乎每天黏在一起是个额外的福利，但他们这样做是因为彼此间的感情，而不是因为天气冷。

"I'm bored," Asuka said. She was leaning against Shinji, her head resting on his shoulder.  
"我好无聊，" 明日香说道。她正倚靠在真嗣身上，头靠在他的肩上。

"Not sure what you expect me to do about that," Shinji said. Though Shinji said this, he had to agree with her. He had forgotten how much downtime they had during the winter months, and it was only starting. On the bright side, it didn't seem as harsh as last years, but the days were sluggishly going by it felt.  
"不知道你指望我怎么办，" 真嗣说。虽然他这么说，但他不得不承认她的感受。他忘记了冬天他们有多少空闲时间，而这一切才刚刚开始。好在，今年似乎没有去年那么严酷，但日子却慢吞吞地过去，让人感觉如此。

"And its too cold." "而且也太冷了。"

"Again, I don't know what you want me to do about that."  
"再说，我不知道你想要我怎么处理这件事。"

"Ahhh, this sucks," groaned Asuka, suddenly sitting up straight and throwing her arms up into the air. "I'm bored, it's cold, and it's gonna be like this for the next three fucking months. I hate this!"  
"啊啊啊，这太糟糕了，"明日香突然坐直身子，双臂猛地举向空中，抱怨道，"我无聊死了，这里又冷，接下来的三个月都得这样。我讨厌这里！"

"...You aren't the only one," sighed Shinji.  
"...你不是一个人，"真嗣叹息道。"

"I don't see you doing anything to help the situation," said Asuka as she rounded on him.  
"我看你也没做什么来改善局面，"明日香转过身来对他说道。

"I could complain like you are."  
"我可以像你一样抱怨。"

Asuka pinched his cheek roughly in reply to his snide comment. Shinji retaliated by kissing her, catching Asuka off guard momentarily. She happily accepted it though, and they fell into the motions as they always did. As they kissed though, Asuka's mind continued churning in the background, to which she finally came up with a solution to both her boredom, and the cold.  
明日香粗鲁地捏了捏他的脸颊，以回应他的挖苦。真嗣回敬了一个吻，让明日香一时措手不及。但她欣然接受了，他们像往常一样沉浸其中。然而，在他们亲吻的同时，明日香的大脑仍在后台运转，最终她想出了一个既能解决无聊又能应对寒冷的办法。

Breaking off the kiss, Asuka looked beside her and said to Shinji, "I've got it. Tomorrow, we're gonna spend the whole day at the hot springs."  
结束亲吻，明日香转头对真嗣说：“我决定了，明天我们一整天都去泡温泉。”

Shinji didn't know how to reply to that, but Asuka continued kissing him again, so he forgot about it for a while. At least, until he woke up that next morning, and Asuka made good on her word.  
真嗣不知如何回应，但明日香又继续吻他，让他暂时忘记了这件事。至少，直到第二天早上醒来，明日香兑现了她的承诺。

---

So, currently, they were driving along the highway north that would take them to the hot springs. They hadn't been up this way since it had started snowing, so Asuka was careful on the highway. Looking back on it, Shinji had to admit this was a brilliant idea. It had been about two weeks since they had come up this way, and it would be nice to just relax in the hot springs all day. He wasn't sure about sleeping in a bed that he wasn't comfortable with, but he would worry about that later.  
于是，他们现在正沿着通往温泉的高速公路向北行驶。自从下雪以来，他们就没来过这里，所以明日香在高速公路上很小心。回想起来，真嗣不得不承认这是个绝妙的主意。大约两周前他们来过这里，能在温泉里放松一整天真是太好了。至于在不习惯的床上睡觉，他打算晚点再担心。

It was nearly a full year now since they had started living in their house, and it was now over a year since they had woken up in Tokyo-3. So much had happened to them since then, but a lot of it was a blur to Shinji. They were older now, both around sixteen years of age, so they were certainly more mature than they used to be, but there was still the occasional childish comment or remark from them. They couldn't be considered children after everything they'd been through, but neither had they full matured yet, so they couldn't really be considered adults either.  
自从他们开始在这栋房子里生活，已经快满一年了，而从他们在第三新东京市醒来算起，也已经过去了一年多。自那以后，他们经历了太多，但对真嗣来说，很多事情都变得模糊不清。如今他们都已十六岁左右，比以前成熟了不少，但偶尔还是会冒出些孩子气的话语或评论。经历了那么多，他们已不再是孩子，但也尚未完全成熟，所以也不能算是成年人。

They continued pushing the limits of their relationship, testing the boundaries and occasionally pushing the line further and further out, but they still hadn't reached the all important 'act' yet. They had however started to explore each other further, and Shinji now rarely slept in anything other than a single pair of shorts. Asuka had grown used to this, and seemed to fall asleep easier it seemed too sometimes when she was resting against Shinji's bare chest.  
他们继续推动着彼此关系的极限，不断试探界限，偶尔还会将那条线推得更远，但他们仍未触及那个至关重要的‘行动’。然而，他们已经开始更深入地探索对方，真嗣现在几乎只穿一条短裤睡觉。明日香对此已经习以为常，有时似乎靠着真嗣赤裸的胸膛更容易入睡。

Occasionally, Asuka would even let up her defenses. She was always careful about how much she would let Shinji touch, and always stopped short of her beasts and butt, but nearly everything else was fair game. Shinji had quickly come to the conclusion that Asuka was immensely ticklish at her stomach, and enjoyed teasing her whenever she allowed. There was still always the temptation about her breasts and butt though, both of which had become more accented. Shinji sometimes wondered if she wasn't just teasing him, wondering if she could break him into coping a feel, but he had proved resilient so far.  
偶尔，明日香也会放下她的防备。她总是小心翼翼地控制着让真嗣触碰的程度，总是避免触及她的敏感部位和臀部，但几乎其他所有地方都是公平的游戏。真嗣很快就得出结论，明日香的肚子极其怕痒，每当她允许时，他都喜欢逗弄她。尽管如此，她胸部和臀部的诱惑依然存在，这两个部位变得更加引人注目。真嗣有时会想，她是不是在故意逗他，想知道她是否能让他忍不住摸一下，但他迄今为止都表现得很有自制力。

It took them far longer to drive to the hot springs than normally, due to the slickness of the roads. The station wagon functioned better on snow and ice than the truck did, so they had been driving it for the past two weeks since it had started snowing.  
由于道路湿滑，他们开车去温泉的时间比平时长得多。旅行车在雪地和冰面上比卡车表现更好，所以自从下雪以来，他们已经开了两周的旅行车。

They eventually arrived though, and before Shinji could even say anything about unpacking the car, Asuka had already jumped out, and with her backpack in hand, darted into the front doors. Shinji let out an exasperated sigh, and then slowly began taking in everything they had brought from the food they had gathered at the grocery store, to their own blankets and pillows. Grabbing his own backpack, he trudged down the hallway and entered the changing room, changing into a pair of swim trunks.  
他们最终还是到了，还没等真嗣开口说卸车的事，明日香就已经跳下车，背着背包冲进了前门。真嗣无奈地叹了口气，然后慢慢开始整理他们从超市采购的食物，到各自的毯子和枕头。他拿起自己的背包，拖着沉重的步伐穿过走廊，进入更衣室，换上了一条泳裤。

Passing by the lockers and towel dispensary, he opened the door into the open air bath, and wasn't surprised to see Asuka already there, floating with ease in the water.  
经过储物柜和毛巾发放处，他推开通往露天浴池的门，并不意外地看到明日香已经在水中轻松地漂浮着。

From their many trips to the hotel, they had learned that their were many different hot springs, from indoor, to outdoor, and mixed bathing ones, as well as a particularly large one that could double as a swimming pool. This last one was the one they frequented the most, and the one that Shinji knew he'd find Asuka at.  
通过多次入住酒店，他们了解到这里有多种不同的温泉，从室内到室外，再到混合浴池，还有一个特别大的温泉，可以兼作游泳池。他们最常去的就是这个，真嗣知道他会在那里找到明日香。

"What took you so long?" asked Asuka as she rolled in the water to look at him.  
"你怎么这么慢？" 明日香一边在水中翻滚一边看着他问道。

"Bringing everything in. What did you think?"  
"全带来了。你以为呢？"

"You couldn't save that for later?"  
"不能留到以后再做吗？"

"I'd rather get it done now. Besides, it was a lot."  
"我宁愿现在就完成它。再说，这事儿挺多的。"

Sitting down on the edge, Shinji stuck his legs into the water. His upper body was still exposed to the elements, though his lower was burning up, making it a very odd combination. It felt good in a strange way, and Shinji felt his eyes wavering slightly.  
坐在边缘，真嗣将双腿浸入水中。他的上半身仍暴露在外，而下半身却热得发烫，这种组合颇为怪异。这种感觉在某种程度上很舒服，真嗣感到自己的眼神有些动摇。

"Aren't you coming in all the way?" asked Asuka.  
"你不打算全身都进来吗？" 明日香问道。

"I will in a minute," said Shinji, enjoying the mixture of hot and cold enveloping his body.  
"我一会儿就好," 真嗣说道，享受着身体被热冷交织的感觉。

Asuka frowned at this, and then slowly walked over to him. Shinji was hardly paying her any attention, which was the complete opposite of what Asuka wanted right now. Crouching down so that everything but her face was submerged in the water, Shinji finally took notice of this strange behavior, and looked at her.  
明日香对此皱了皱眉，然后缓缓走向他。真嗣几乎没注意到她，这完全不是明日香现在想要的。她蹲下身，除了脸之外都浸在水中，真嗣这才注意到这奇怪的行为，看向她。

"Asuka, what are you do-"  
"明日香，你在做什-"

Shinji didn't finished his sentence, as Asuka suddenly grabbed his ankles that were submerged in the water, and using all of her strength, which was nothing to laugh at, pulled him all the way into the water.  
真嗣的话还没说完，就被明日香突然抓住了浸在水中的脚踝，她用尽全力——这可不是闹着玩的——把他整个人拽进了水里。

Shinji sank down immediately, being submerged entirely, the sudden change in temperature assaulting his upper body almost unbearable. He opened his eyes underwater, and saw that Asuka had submerged herself as well, a mischievous grin plastered across her face. He had a sudden urge to swim towards her and kiss her while they were both underwater, but he held himself back.  
真嗣立刻沉了下去，完全被水淹没，突如其来的温度变化让他的上半身几乎无法承受。他在水下睁开眼睛，看到明日香也潜了进来，脸上挂着调皮的笑容。他突然有种冲动想游向她，在水下亲吻她，但还是忍住了。

Breaking the surface, he let out heavy breath and then looked over at Asuka who had just emerged as well.  
他破水而出，重重地喘了口气，然后看向刚刚也浮出水面的明日香。

"Why did you do that?" asked Shinji.  
“你为什么要那么做？”真嗣问道。

"Because you were being dumb," answered Asuka playfully.  
“因为你当时很傻啊，”明日香俏皮地回答。

Now that Shinji saw Asuka standing fully upright, he found his gaze locked to her body. She was wearing a red bikini that didn't leave much to the imagination. It was nothing like the white bikini she had initially wore when her figure wasn't as full. Her distinct cleavage was visible at this distance, beads of water apparent on her white skin. The shape of her butt clearly defined thanks to the strip of red cloth fastened securely around her hips. Shinji had to swallow a multitude of thoughts as he stared at her, knowing that he was aroused. Asuka just smiled at him knowingly, before sinking back into the water, floating there.  
现在，真嗣看到明日香完全站直了身子，他的目光不由自主地锁定在她身上。她穿着一件红色比基尼，几乎没有什么遮掩。这与她最初穿的白色比基尼截然不同，那时她的身材还没有现在这么丰满。在这个距离下，她明显的乳沟清晰可见，水珠在她白皙的皮肤上闪烁。由于那条紧紧系在腰间的红色布条，她的臀部曲线也清晰地展现出来。真嗣盯着她，不得不咽下许多思绪，他知道自己被她吸引了。明日香只是心知肚明地对他微笑，然后又沉回水中，漂浮在那里。

'You really are too much Asuka,' thought Shinji before he too sank back down into the water as well.  
'你真是太过分了，明日香。' 真嗣想着，自己也跟着沉回了水中。

Looking up at the sky, he could only describe it as a murky grey. He wondered if they'd get more snow today, since they hadn't had any for about two days now. The ground all around the hot springs and the small bushes and trees all had snow on them. The whole place looked like a dream almost.  
抬头望向天空，他只能形容那是一片混沌的灰色。他不知道今天是否会下更多的雪，毕竟已经两天没有下雪了。温泉周围的土地、小灌木和树木上都覆盖着雪。整个地方看起来几乎像是一场梦。

"I'm glad you decided to come here today Asuka," said Shinji, as he continued to look up at the sky.  
“我很高兴你今天决定来这里，明日香。” 真嗣说着，继续抬头望着天空。

"I'm glad you like it," said Asuka, her voice far closer to him then he had thought.  
“我很高兴你喜欢，”明日香说道，她的声音比他预想的要近得多。

Looking away from the sky, Shinji looked down and saw that Asuka had filled his vision. She was grinning at him again, her eyes sparkling with a kind of seductiveness. Asuka was exuding her desires in waves directed at Shinji, making him start to feel uncomfortable.  
移开看向天空的视线，真嗣低头发现明日香已填满他的视野。她再次对他咧嘴笑，眼中闪烁着一种诱惑的光芒。明日香正以波涛般的方式向他散发着欲望，让他开始感到不安。

'And I was just starting to regain control of myself,' thought Shinji as Asuka pressed her hands against his chest. She ran her hands over his chest, passing over every grove and line on his chest. Shinji had to hold his breath when her hands passed over his nipples. She had gotten far too good at this, and Shinji's mind was fast turning into white noise.  
“我刚刚才开始重新控制自己，”真嗣心想，明日香将双手按在他的胸前。她用手抚过他的胸膛，掠过每一道线条和轮廓。当她的手掠过他的乳头时，真嗣不得不屏住呼吸。她在这方面已经变得太熟练了，真嗣的思绪很快变成了一片空白。

Pushing him backwards till he hit the edge of the hot springs, Asuka leaned up and kissed him quickly, her hands still pressed against his chest. Shinji kissed her back, though he was unsure what he should do with his own hands. The natural thing would have been to wrap them around Asuka's back, but he wasn't sure that was what she wanted right now.  
将他推到温泉边缘，明日香倾身迅速吻了他，双手仍紧贴着他的胸膛。真嗣回吻了她，尽管不确定自己的手该放在哪里。本能上应该是环抱住明日香的背部，但他不确定这是否是她此刻想要的。

Asuka removed her hands from his chest though, and wrapped them around his back, pressing her entire body against him as they kissed. This stimulus was far too much for Shinji. Asuka's breasts, covered only by the thin fabric of the bikini, pressed against his chest, their suppleness only too apparent in the way they pressed against his chest. This was too far for Shinji though, and rather sudden. He wanted nothing more than to pull off that top concealing what was underneath, but he couldn't, not unless Asuka told him to.  
然而，明日香从他的胸前移开了双手，转而环抱住他的背部，将整个身体紧贴着他亲吻。这对真嗣来说刺激太过强烈。明日香仅穿着薄薄的比基尼，胸部紧贴着他的胸膛，那份柔软透过布料清晰地传递过来。尽管如此，这对真嗣来说还是太过突然。他只想扯掉那件遮掩着底下风光的上衣，但他不能，除非明日香允许他这么做。

"Asuka...hang on," Shinji spoke in between kisses. Asuka seemed to have lost herself though, and only when Shinji held her by the shoulders to stop her feverish kissing did she listen.  
“明日香...等一下，”真嗣在亲吻间隙说道。明日香似乎已经忘我，直到真嗣抓住她的肩膀制止她狂热的亲吻，她才停下来。

"What?" she finally asked, her face dyed red, though whether it was the heat from the hot springs, or embarrassment, Shinji wasn't sure.  
"什么？" 她终于问道，脸颊染上了红色，尽管这究竟是温泉的热气所致，还是因为尴尬，真嗣并不确定。

"Sorry, this is too much."  
"抱歉，这太过分了。"

"What is?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow.  
"什么太过分了？" 明日香挑起眉毛问道。

"...Your breasts pressing against me," Shinji stated after much deliberation.  
"...你的胸部紧贴着我，" 经过一番深思熟虑后，真嗣说道。

Asuka had to give him some credit, since she didn't actually think that he would bring it up. Now that he said it though, she was overly aware of what she was doing. She had grown used to interacting with each other this naturally, but because of the heat of the hot springs, and her own body, she had forgotten herself for a while.  
明日香不得不给他一些赞许，因为她没想到他真的会提起这件事。现在他这么一说，她变得格外意识到自己的行为。她已经习惯了这样自然而然地与对方互动，但由于温泉的热度和她自己的身体反应，她有一段时间忘记了自己的举止。

"Right...sorry, I might have gone too far," mumbled Asuka.  
"对...对不起，我可能做得有点过头了，" 明日香咕哝道。

"No, you didn't. I just-"  
"不，你没有。我只是——"

"No. My bad. Really, I should't have done that I just-"  
"不，是我的错。真的，我本不该那么做，我只是——"

But Asuka didn't get much farther than that. She felt her vision begin to fade, and lost her balance, falling into Shinji's chest again. Thinking that it had been on purpose, Shinji was startled, but noticed that she was breathing rather erratic.  
但明日香没能再说下去。她感到视线开始模糊，失去了平衡，再次倒在了真嗣的胸口。真嗣以为她是故意的，吓了一跳，但注意到她的呼吸相当不稳。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"...Sorry...I think the heat might be getting to me. I'm not feeling so great."  
"...对不起...我觉得可能是热过头了。我感觉不太好。"

Her consciousness was fading, which quickly became apparent to Shinji. She seemed to be having a bought of heat stroke. Lifting her up, Shinji left the hot springs with Asuka against his chest. She was still breathing rather raggedly, and he couldn't imagine her body was reacting very well against the sudden change in temperature. His own body was screaming at him for the sudden change.  
她的意识正在消退，这让真嗣很快察觉到了。她似乎是中暑了。真嗣抱起她，带着靠在他胸前的明日香离开了温泉。她呼吸仍然相当急促，他无法想象她的身体对这种突然的温度变化会有多好的反应。他自己的身体也在因这突如其来的变化而向他抗议。

Kicking open the sliding door, he stepped through the changing room where both his and Asuka's clothes were. The thought of forcefully changing Asuka didn't exist in Shinji's mind: he didn't think he could handle the strain. Instead, he walked up a set of wooden stairs to the second floor where most of the rooms were. Shinji had already placed their luggage in a large room that was about as large as a suite.  
他一脚踢开滑动门，走进了更衣室，那里有他和明日香的衣服。真嗣的脑海中并没有强行给明日香换衣服的想法：他认为自己无法承受那种压力。相反，他走上了一组木楼梯，来到了二楼，那里大多是房间。真嗣已经把他们的行李放在了一个大房间里，大小差不多相当于一个套房。

Thankfully, he had left the door open earlier, so he didn't have to worry about kicking it down. The room was spacious, the bedroom and the rest of the room separated by a series of sliding doors. It came complete with a couch, table and chairs, and a mini fridge with bar. On the opposite side of the room was another sliding glass door, leading to the outside, though the balcony was piled with snow. Now that Shinji was fresh out of the hot springs, he didn't realize how low the temperature was, though since he still only had his swimming trunks on, that probably didn't help.  
幸好他之前留了门，不必担心要破门而入。房间宽敞，卧室与起居区由一排滑动门隔开。配备有沙发、桌椅和迷你冰箱吧台。对面是另一扇滑动玻璃门，通向户外，但阳台上积满了雪。如今真嗣刚从温泉出来，并未意识到气温有多低，或许只穿着泳裤也是原因之一。

Setting Asuka down on bed, he opened his own backpack and removed a towel, proceeding to dry her off as best as he could. Asuka had her eyes closed, and was still panting, but the complexion in her face was starting to return to a normal hue. After several minutes of this, Asuka finally took the towel from him and said-  
将明日香安置在床上后，他打开自己的背包，取出一条毛巾，尽可能地为她擦干。明日香闭着眼睛，仍在喘息，但脸色逐渐恢复了正常。几分钟后，明日香终于从他手中接过毛巾，说道——

"I can do the rest, so find me something to wear."  
“剩下的我自己来，给我找件衣服。”

Shinji was glad that she had said this, since he wasn't sure how to dry her chest area. While Asuka continued to dry herself, Shinji rummaged through her backpack, searching for stuff that would be warm enough. When he opened a certain pocket though, and saw an assortment of brightly colored underwear, he blindly grabbed two colors, hoping that they were a matching pair. Other than this, he had chosen a pair of navy blue jeans, and a white t-shirt with matching sweatshirt.  
真嗣很高兴她这么说了，因为他不确定如何帮她擦干胸部。当明日香继续擦干自己时，真嗣在她的背包里翻找，寻找足够暖和的东西。当他打开某个口袋，看到一堆色彩鲜艳的内衣时，他盲目地抓了两件，希望它们是一对。除此之外，他还选了一条深蓝色牛仔裤和一件白色 T 恤，以及配套的连帽衫。

Turning around, he walked back into the bedroom, but paused when he saw Asuka. Her back was turned towards him, but Shinji didn't need her facing him to know she was naked. She was running the towel through her long hair, but her bare back was fully exposed to him. From the back of her neck, nearly down to the crevice of her butt, Shinji could see everything. Asuka did have the foresight to pile the blanket directly behind her, concealing her butt. Needless to say, Shinji was captivated by this sight, and it wouldn't have been surprisingly if he had dropped the clothes he had been carrying.  
他转过身，走回卧室，但看到明日香时停了下来。她的背对着他，但真嗣不需要她面对他就能知道她是裸体的。她正用毛巾穿过她的长发，但她的背部完全暴露在他面前。从她的后颈，几乎到臀部裂缝，真嗣能看到一切。明日香还算有先见之明，把毯子直接堆在她身后，遮住了她的臀部。不用说，真嗣被这一幕深深吸引，如果他当时手里拿着的衣服掉下来，也不会让人感到惊讶。

He managed to tear his gaze away from her beautiful figure however, and with his eyes directed at the floor, walked over to the bed and place the clothes behind her.  
他好不容易才将目光从她美丽的身姿上移开，眼睛盯着地板，走到床边将衣服放在她身后。

"Ah, thanks Shinji," said Asuka. Her voice was rather rushed, so it seemed she was conscious of the situation at least.  
“啊，谢谢你，真嗣，”明日香说道。她的声音颇为急促，似乎至少意识到了当前的状况。

"Yeah, no problem," mumbled Shinji. As he turned to leave though, Asuka stopped him.  
“嗯，没什么，”真嗣咕哝着。正当他转身要离开时，明日香叫住了他。

"You don't have to go into the other room you know, you can stay right here."  
"你知道的，你不必去另一个房间，你可以就待在这里。"

"...But you-" "...但是你-"

"Just stay turned around. Besides it's not like-"  
"只要背对着我就行。再说，又不是像-"

Asuka cut herself off though. What had she been about to say, that it didn't matter whether he saw her naked or not? This wasn't true, as anybody would be embarrassed if someone of the opposite sex saw them naked, but Shinji had already seen her back at the very least, and it wasn't like the bikini she had be wearing was that modest in the first place.  
但明日香突然打断了自己。她原本想说什么来着，难道是说无论他是否看到她裸体都无所谓吗？这显然不是真的，因为任何人被异性看到裸体都会感到尴尬，但真嗣至少已经见过她的背部，而且她当时穿的比基尼本身也不算保守。

"Well, do whatever you want then I guess," said Asuka after her pause.  
“好吧，那你想做什么就做吧，我猜，”明日香在停顿后说道。

Shinji continued facing away from her, while Asuka finished drying herself off. If Shinji was truly honest with himself, he didn't only want to stay here, but embrace Asuka from behind as well. Just the sight of her bare back was enough to arouse him all over again. Sometimes he wondered if Asuka took her beauty for granted sometimes, but every passing day, Shinji was reminded of it. Still, it was either stay, or don't.  
真嗣继续背对着她，而明日香则擦干了身体。如果真嗣对自己足够诚实，他不仅想留在这里，还想从背后拥抱明日香。仅仅是看到她裸露的背部就足以让他再次兴奋起来。有时他怀疑明日香是否对自己的美貌习以为常，但随着每一天的过去，真嗣都会被提醒这一点。不过，留下来还是离开，这是个问题。

He decided to stay, probably against his better judgement, but he wanted to be close to her. Sitting down on the edge of the bed, Shinji heard Asuka pause briefly, before continuing to run the towel through her hair. There had been a brief surge of tension, but it had disappeared quickly. Shinji let out an inaudible sigh, aware how small of a distance separated himself from Asuka's nakedness.  
他决定留下，尽管这可能违背了他的理智判断，但他渴望靠近她。坐在床边，真嗣听到明日香停顿了一下，然后继续用毛巾擦拭头发。虽然有一瞬间的紧张感，但很快就消失了。真嗣无声地叹了口气，意识到自己与明日香的裸体之间仅隔着微小的距离。

Moments later, Shinji felt sometime soft hit his head from behind.  
片刻之后，真嗣感到有什么柔软的东西从背后击中了他的头。

"You haven't dried yourself yet," came Asuka's voice behind him. "I'm done, so you should dry yourself as well."  
“你还没擦干自己呢，”明日香的声音从他身后传来，“我已经好了，你也该擦干自己。”

This made sense, but Shinji was all too aware that the towel Asuka had passed him, was the one she had just finished using. It was still wet, and he could very distinctly smell the flowery sent from her hair wafting off the fabric. But it would have seemed ungrateful if he didn't accept this, so he began drying his body while Asuka began changing behind him. He felt the bed shifting while she dressed, and the pile of clothes between them became smaller.  
这说得通，但真嗣非常清楚，明日香递给他的毛巾正是她刚用过的。毛巾还是湿的，他还能清晰地闻到从布料上飘来的她头发上的花香。但如果他不接受，似乎显得不领情，于是他开始擦干身体，而明日香则在他身后开始换衣服。她穿衣服时床的晃动，以及他们之间的衣物堆逐渐变小，他都感觉到了。

When Asuka had finished dressing, she turned around to Shinji, but he was still drying himself, working the towel through his hair. His back was to her, and Asuka wanted to wrap her arms around him and kiss his neck, but she instead took the towel from him.  
当明日香换好衣服后，她转身面对真嗣，但他还在擦干自己，用毛巾梳理着头发。他的背对着她，明日香想抱住他，亲吻他的脖子，但她只是从他手中拿走了毛巾。

"Asuka?" Shinji asked, startled that the towel had suddenly left his hands.  
“明日香？”真嗣惊讶地问道，毛巾突然从他手中被拿走。

"Here, let me do this since you helped earlier.  
“来，我来弄这个，毕竟你之前帮过忙。”

Shinji nodded wordlessly, letting Asuka run the towel through his hair for several minutes. After she deemed it good enough, she tossed the towel to the side, and wrapped her arms around him, pulling him backwards towards her.  
真嗣默默点头，让明日香用毛巾在他头发上擦了几分钟。她觉得差不多了，就把毛巾扔到一边，双臂环抱住他，将他向后拉向自己。

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

Shinji was silenced with a kiss as Asuka pulled him back into her arms. They collapsed on the bed, Shinji resting on top of Asuka, but after several seconds of kissing, Shinji had to stop.  
明日香将真嗣拉回怀中，用一个吻让他安静下来。他们倒在床上，真嗣压在明日香身上，但几秒钟后，真嗣不得不停下来。

"Just to be sure, you're feeling better right?"  
"只是确认一下，你现在感觉好些了吧？"

"Yeah, sorry about earlier," smiled Asuka.  
"嗯，之前抱歉了，" 明日香微笑着说。

With that simple exchange out of the way, Shinji leaned in to kiss her once more, before returning to the living room.  
简单交流过后，真嗣再次倾身吻了她，然后回到客厅。

"What are you doing?" asked Asuka, clearly wishing that he hadn't left.  
“你在干什么？”明日香问道，显然希望他没离开。

"I don't plan on walking around with my swim trunks on for the rest of the day," stated Shinji.  
“我不打算整天穿着泳裤走来走去，”真嗣说道。

"Oh, right," mumbled Asuka. "Well, I guess this is a good time as any to prepare lunch then," she said as she got off the bed.  
“哦，对，”明日香咕哝道。“好吧，我想现在正是准备午饭的好时机，”她说着从床上下来。

---

Their time at the hot springs slowly ticked by. They had brought all of the necessities with them, so cooking wasn't a problem with the camping stove they had. Asuka made soup to warm them up, but even that only helped relieve the cold for a limited time. It was rather unnerving how much they relied on the fireplace back home to keep them warm during cold days like today. The only bright side was that it hadn't started snowing again yet.  
他们在温泉的时间缓缓流逝。他们带上了所有必需品，所以用带来的露营炉做饭不成问题。明日香煮了汤来暖身，但即便如此，也只能暂时缓解寒冷。他们在家中多么依赖壁炉来抵御像今天这样的寒冷日子，这让人感到相当不安。唯一的好消息是，雪还没有再次开始下。

Sipping cups of tea while snuggled against one another, they were seated on the single couch with a blanket wrapped around them. Shinji had toyed with walking around the small town for a while, but he didn't think Asuka would want to brave the cold. He was probably fine with it himself, but she would likely start complaining as soon as they got outside.  
他们依偎在一起，啜饮着茶，坐在唯一的沙发上，裹着毯子。真嗣曾想过在小镇上走走，但他觉得明日香可能不想忍受寒冷。他自己或许没问题，但她一旦出门，很可能会立刻开始抱怨。

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka suddenly.  
“嘿，真嗣？”明日香突然问道。

"What's up?" "怎么了？"

"Well, I was just wondering, seeing as how we've been together for over a year now, do you ever wish that things were different?"  
"嗯，我只是好奇，毕竟我们在一起已经超过一年了，你有没有想过希望事情有所不同？"

"...As in our relationship, or-"  
"...你是说我们的关系，还是——"

"Nothing like that, and I don't think you'd have to answer even if that was my question. No, I meant that our lives themselves."  
"不是那样的，我想即使那是我的问题，你也不必回答。不，我是说我们的生活本身。"

"Well, there's plenty that I wish could be different. Even I get sick having to deal with canned food day after day, and what I wouldn't give for running water. We've got a house to keep us warm though, so it's not like we lack that at least."  
"嗯，有很多我希望可以不同的事情。即使是我，天天吃罐头食品也会腻，我多么渴望能有自来水。不过我们有房子保暖，至少我们不缺这个。"

"You're still not getting me. This life," said Asuka as she gestured with her hands between them, "Is there anything you'd wish was different, or want to change."  
"你还是没明白我的意思。这种生活，" 明日香说着，用手在他们之间比划，"你有没有什么希望改变的，或者想要改变的事情。"

"So this is about our relationship?" asked Shinji, feeling far more puzzled than when Asuka had first started talking.  
"所以这是关于我们的关系？" 真嗣问道，感觉比阿斯卡最初开始谈话时更加困惑。

"God, you're being dense," groaned Asuka, as she tilted her head back and spoke to the ceiling. She really didn't want to spell it out for him, but it looked like she might have to.  
"天啊，你真是迟钝，" 阿斯卡叹息道，她仰头对着天花板说话。她真的不想把话说得太明白，但看起来可能不得不这么做。

"Um, Asuka, are you perhaps suggesting whether I'd want to be living like this with anyone else?"  
"呃，阿斯卡，你是不是在暗示我是否愿意和别人这样生活？"

"No, and besides, I already know what the answer to that is," sighed Asuka.  
"不，而且，我已经知道那个问题的答案了，"明日香叹息道。

"Then what-" "那还有什么-"

"Never mind. Forget it. Dumb thing to ask anyway," mumbled Asuka.  
"算了。忘了吧。反正问了也是蠢问题，"明日香咕哝道。

Shinji blinked several times, still not sure what Asuka was talking about. She was sulking a bit now, so Shinji put an arm around her trying to comfort her. Asuka stubbornly refused his advances for several minutes in silence until she finally turned towards him and pinched his cheek roughly.  
真嗣眨了几次眼，仍然不确定明日香在说什么。她现在有点闹别扭，于是真嗣伸出一只手臂搂住她，试图安慰她。明日香固执地沉默了几分钟拒绝他的亲近，直到她终于转向他，粗鲁地捏了他的脸颊。

"Ow! What was that for?"  
“哎哟！你干嘛？”

"For being annoying and dense," said Asuka right before she kissed him. For all her comments, she didn't really care one way or another.  
“因为烦人又迟钝，”明日香说完就吻了他。尽管她嘴上这么说，其实她并不真的在意。

The kiss was quick, and rather lacking in Shinji's opinion, so when he drew close to her again, Asuka held her hand up and said, "Don't want to right now."  
那个吻很仓促，在真嗣看来相当敷衍，所以当他再次靠近她时，明日香举起手说：“现在不想亲。”

Shinji didn't like this response though, so he started kissing her hand, at which point Asuka truly became annoyed at him.  
真嗣不喜欢这个回答，于是他开始亲吻她的手，这让明日香真的对他感到恼火。

"Seriously, quit it Shinji. I'm not in the mood right now."  
“说真的，别闹了真嗣。我现在没心情。”

"Then you shouldn't have kissed me first," stated Shinji.  
"那你就不该先吻我，" 真嗣说道。

"That was," started Asuka as she dug around her mind for an excuse, but she couldn't find one.  
"那是，" 明日香开始在脑海中寻找借口，但她找不到一个。

"You just wanted to," smirked Shinji, knowing that this was the truth.  
"你只是想这么做，" 真嗣得意地笑着，知道这是事实。

"It's not like that's a bad thing," mumbled Asuka.  
"那也不是什么坏事，" 明日香咕哝道。

"So lets continue," said Shinji.  
"那我们继续吧，" 真嗣说道。

'God, when did he become so pushy?' thought Asuka as she looked at Shinji.  
'天啊，他什么时候变得这么强势了？' 明日香看着真嗣心想。

"Later," said Asuka. "I'm going back to the hot springs."  
"待会儿见，" 明日香说。"我要回温泉去。"

"Is that such a good idea?" asked Shinji leaning away from her slightly.  
"那样好吗？" 真嗣微微侧身避开她问道。"

"I plan on relaxing in the woman's bath, so that means you're forbidden from going over there."  
"我打算在女汤里放松一下，所以你可别想着过去。"

'Besides,' thought Asuka, 'the only reason I got heat stroke was because I over exerted myself because you were there.'  
'再说了，'明日香心想，'我会中暑只是因为你在场，我才过度劳累的。'

"Right," grumbled Shinji.  
“好吧，”真嗣咕哝道。

Shinji watched her gather up a couple things before she left. Occasionally, Asuka would do this when they went to the hot springs, and occupied the woman's bath by herself, just to collect her thoughts and relax. During these times, Shinji was forbidden from seeking her out or joining her, and Shinji assumed this was because she usually entered while naked. He still wasn't sure whether this was smart, considering that it hadn't been very long since her bout of heat stroke.  
真嗣看着她收拾了几样东西后离开。偶尔，当他们去温泉时，明日香会这样做，独自占用女浴池，只为整理思绪和放松。在这些时候，真嗣被禁止去找她或加入她，他猜想这通常是因为她通常是裸体进入的。他仍然不确定这样做是否明智，毕竟她不久前才刚中暑。

With Asuka gone, the room felt significantly more empty, and Shinji was wishing that he had brought a book to read if he knew they would be spending time apart like this. He still wondered what Asuka had been talking about earlier, but nothing clicked in his brain.  
随着明日香离开，房间显得更加空荡，真嗣希望自己要是早知道他们会这样分开度过时间，就该带本书来读。他仍在琢磨明日香之前在说什么，但脑中一片空白。

Standing up, he placed the two empty tea cups on the makeshift counters. He was quickly growing bored, and thought about going to the mens side himself, but pushed that proposal away. In all likelihood, he'd just begin thinking about Asuka's naked figure in the hot springs by herself, and that would probably lead to a very unwise decision.  
他站起身，将两个空茶杯放在临时搭建的台子上。他很快感到无聊，想着自己去男汤那边，但又打消了这个念头。很可能，他会开始想象明日香独自在温泉中的裸体，那很可能会导致一个非常不明智的决定。

Instead, he decided to walk outside, since Asuka wouldn't be coming back for at least an hour, if not more. Without her complaining about the cold, Shinji could walk around the small town.  
于是，他决定到外面走走，因为明日香至少一个小时内不会回来，甚至更久。没有她抱怨寒冷，真嗣可以在小镇上随意逛逛。

As has been said before, the town had only a single road running through it, with the shops and small stores lining the side of the street. The hot springs was the main attraction of the town, and the Shinto shrine which was a popular spot for tourists, as well as the Japanese people. It was a rather well known shrine apparently.  
如前所述，这个小镇只有一条贯穿其中的道路，两旁排列着商店和小店铺。温泉是小镇的主要景点，而那座颇受游客和日本人欢迎的神社也是一大亮点。显然，这是一座相当有名的神社。

Slipping on a sweatshirt over his long sleeve shirt, Shinji left their room, and walked down the flight of stairs before exiting the hotel. His feet crunched on the snow as he walked passed their car parked closest to the front. He didn't know where the sidewalk was, so he just walked down the middle of the road. The sky above him was still a murky grey, but it hadn't started snowing, yet.  
真嗣在长袖衬衫外披上运动衫，离开了房间，走下楼梯后走出酒店。他的脚踩在雪地上发出嘎吱声，经过停在前方最近处的他们的车。他不知道人行道在哪里，于是就沿着路中央走。头顶的天空依旧灰蒙蒙的，但雪还未开始下。

This wasn't the first time he had walked around the town, but certainly the first while the snow was present. During one of their early trips to the hot springs, they had ventured up to the shrine in the afternoon, and explored the surrounding area. As with most Japanese shrines, the grounds themselves were beautiful, scenery that seemed unique to the shrine itself.  
这并非他第一次在镇上闲逛，但确实是在雪中行走的第一次。在他们早期的温泉之旅中，他们曾在下午徒步前往神社，探索周边地区。与大多数日本神社一样，那里的环境本身就很美，景色似乎独属于神社本身。

Because of the snow, he initially passed the small turn off which led to to the shrine. It was in the hills above the village, and could only be traveled to after a long hike up. Several cars lined the street where people had likely stopped to get out, and one large tour bus was lined up against the curb as well.  
因为下雪，他起初错过了通往神社的小岔路。神社位于村庄上方的山丘上，只能通过长途徒步才能到达。街道旁停着几辆车，可能是人们停下来准备步行，还有一辆大型旅游巴士也靠在路边。

The steps were covered with snow, but underneath them, a thin layer of ice had formed, so Shinji was careful as he began the steady climb to the shrine above. The trees and bushes around him were powdery white as though they had been dipped in flour, and the handrail which wound its way up was covered with frozen icicles. Shinji kept his hands in his pockets as he climbed, slightly wishing that he had brought gloves.  
台阶被雪覆盖，但下面形成了一层薄冰，因此真嗣小心翼翼地开始向神社攀登。周围的树木和灌木都覆盖着一层粉状的白雪，仿佛被撒上了面粉，蜿蜒而上的扶手也布满了冰柱。真嗣把手插在口袋里攀爬，有点希望自己带了手套。

Before long, the scenery began to change as the rows of red arches appeared before him. The climb became steadily steeper, and Shinji started to breath harder, his breath clearly visible in the frigid air. The steps rose and fell, twisting upwards with the occasional bench for people out of breath to rest briefly. Shinji didn't pause though, and continued climbing.  
不久，景色开始变化，一排排红色拱门出现在他面前。攀登变得越来越陡峭，真嗣开始呼吸急促，呼出的气息在寒冷的空气中清晰可见。台阶起伏不定，蜿蜒向上，偶尔设有供人喘息的休息长椅。但真嗣没有停下，继续攀登。

As he reached the last few steps, he could see the shrine emerging through the line of tree in front of him. Compared to the ones in downtown Kyoto, it was minuscule, hardly a fraction of the size, but it was still an important shrine.  
当他踏上最后几级台阶时，眼前透过一排树木，隐约可见那座神社。与京都市中心的那些相比，它显得微不足道，规模不及几分之一，但仍是一座重要的神社。

Walking along the narrow path, Shinji crossed over a small bridge that had a stream, completely frozen over, running under it. The path was even more treacherous here, the smooth brick covered with ice underneath the snow so easy to slip on.  
沿着狭窄的小径行走，真嗣跨过了一座小桥，桥下是一条完全冰封的小溪。这里的路径更加险峻，光滑的砖石被雪下的冰覆盖，极易滑倒。

Back in the summer, the sight from on top of the bridge looking over the valley below was something to behold, and while still breathtaking with the whole valley white, was a different sight entirely. Shinji paused as he stood in the middle, looking to the hills across from him. The village was in the middle, so from here, he couldn't see the small structures below, but he knew Asuka was down there somewhere.  
夏天时，从桥上俯瞰下方的山谷，是一幅令人叹为观止的景象，而如今整个山谷一片雪白，虽然同样令人心旷神怡，却是截然不同的风光。真嗣站在桥中央，停下脚步望向对面的山丘。村庄位于中间，所以从这里他看不到下方的小屋，但他知道明日香就在那里的某个地方。

Turning back to the shrine, he walked up the few front steps, and opened the shoji doors to the interior, if it could be called that. It was hardly bigger than their walk in closet back home, but it was large enough for Shinji to walk in at least. The structure was only one story, with no windows and at the center was a shrine dedicated to some god. Shinji had already been here before, but he didn't pray for anything at the time. Again, Shinji wasn't religious, but that didn't mean he didn't understand certain Japanese customs.  
他转身回到神社，走上前几级台阶，推开了通往内部的障子门，如果那可以称之为内部的话。这个地方并不比他们在老家的步入式衣橱大多少，但至少足够让真嗣走进去。建筑只有一层，没有窗户，中央供奉着某个神的神龛。真嗣之前来过这里，但当时他并没有祈求什么。再次强调，真嗣并非虔诚的信徒，但这并不意味着他不理解某些日本习俗。

Clapping his hands together, he stood in front of the shrine for several seconds, making a silent prayer, and then stood back. He didn't expect anything to happen, but it was more for his conscious than anything. If God, or this god did exist, would He have allowed Third Impact to happen? This was all far above Shinji's head though, and he could only hope for what the future may bring.  
他双手合十，在神龛前静立了几秒钟，默默祈祷，然后退后一步。他并不期待会有什么发生，这更多是为了自己的良心。如果上帝，或者这个神真的存在，祂会允许第三次冲击发生吗？这一切对真嗣来说都太过深奥，他只能寄希望于未来可能带来的变化。

He didn't linger around the shrine very long after this, and began walking down the steps to the village below. He figured that Asuka would be done with her bath by now, and probably wondering where he had run off to.  
在这之后，他没有在神社逗留太久，开始走下台阶前往下面的村庄。他猜想明日香现在应该已经洗完澡了，可能还在纳闷他跑哪儿去了。

---

When he opened the door to the hotel, Shinji just caught Asuka exiting the bathhouse it seemed. Her hair was done up in a ponytail, and she had her towel draped across her shoulders, and she was wearing a long t-shirt that went below her waist, and what he could only assume were shorts underneath that.  
当他打开酒店的门时，似乎正好撞见刚从澡堂出来的明日香。她的头发扎成了马尾，肩上搭着毛巾，穿着一件长及腰下的 T 恤，下面他猜应该是短裤。

"Did you go outside?" wondered Asuka in amazement.  
“你出去了吗？”明日香惊讶地问。

"Ah, yeah. I just got back. You done with your bath?"  
“啊，是的。我刚回来。你洗完澡了吗？”

"Yeah, I am. Where did you go?"  
"是啊，我去了。你去了哪里？"

"The shrine," shrugged Shinji.  
"神社，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"

"Hmm?" muttered Asuka with a raised eyebrow. "Well, either way, I feel loads better now that I've had time to relax."  
"嗯？" 明日香挑起眉毛嘀咕道。"不管怎样，我现在感觉好多了，毕竟有时间放松了一下。"

She stretched, throwing her arms up in the air, and Shinji thought that her shirt was going to reveal her navel, but it didn't, much to his displeasure. Asuka walked over to him though, and cupped his cheeks with her hands making Shinji think she was about to kiss him, but next second, she drew back quickly.  
她伸了个懒腰，双臂高高举起，真嗣以为她的衬衫会露出肚脐，但并没有，这让他颇为失望。不过，明日香走了过来，双手捧住他的脸颊，让真嗣以为她要吻他，但下一秒，她迅速退开了。

"God, you're freezing. How can you be so nonchalant about that?"  
“天啊，你冷得像冰块。怎么能这么不在乎呢？”

"It just doesn't bother me," said Shinji.  
“我就是不在意。”真嗣说道。

"Well, you should warm up at least," said Asuka.  
“嗯，你至少该热热身，”明日香说道。

"I don't plan on going to the hot springs again until after dinner."  
“我不打算再去温泉了，至少要等到晚饭后。”

"That isn't what I meant," smirked Asuka, before she leaned in and kissed him softly. It was long and drawn out, contrary to what Shinji had expected. His own cold lips, and Asuka's warm lips, combined in such a way that Shinji could feel himself heating up in more ways than one. His body was quickly become warm. Asuka's body which was overflowing with warmth from her bath pressed against Shinji, thawing him out.  
“我不是那个意思，”明日香微微一笑，随即倾身轻轻吻了他。这个吻漫长而缠绵，与真嗣所预料的截然不同。他冰冷的唇与明日香温暖的唇交融，让真嗣感到自己不仅仅是在身体上暖和起来。他的身体迅速升温。明日香沐浴后充满暖意的身体紧贴着真嗣，将他彻底温暖。

Asuka broke off the kiss though, to Shinji's annoyance.  
尽管这让真嗣有些恼火，但明日香还是中断了亲吻。

"Why'd you stop?" he asked.  
“你为什么停下来？”他问道。

"I was getting cold," said Asuka.  
“我感到冷了，”明日香说。

"For a reason like that," mumbled Shinji in displeasure.  
"因为那种理由，" 真嗣不满地咕哝道。

Asuka smiled at him, and then took his hand, guiding him upstairs.  
明日香对他微笑，然后牵起他的手，领着他上楼。

"At the very least, you should change into something warmer before we continue."  
"至少，在我们继续之前，你应该换上更暖和的衣服。"

Shinji probably would have started stripping right there if Asuka had allowed him.  
如果明日香允许的话，真嗣可能当场就开始脱衣服了。

They started dinner a little earlier than usual, but it was a rushed affair. After they had gone upstairs and spent sometime with each other, they had quickly grown hungry, and started preparing dinner. It wasn't anything special, just some things that Shinji threw together, but as was usual, Asuka was quite pleased with his cooking.  
他们比平时稍早一些开始晚餐，但这是一顿匆忙的饭。上楼相处了一段时间后，他们很快就饿了，于是开始准备晚餐。没什么特别的，只是真嗣随手凑合的一些东西，但一如既往，明日香对他的厨艺相当满意。

After clearing everything away, Shinji gathered up his swim trunks from earlier in the day. He was glad to be going into the hot springs again, hoping that he could relax easier than earlier.  
收拾完一切后，真嗣收拾起白天穿的泳裤。他很高兴能再次泡温泉，希望这次能比之前更放松。

"You ready yet Asuka?" asked Shinji.  
"准备好了吗，明日香？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka was in the bedroom, going through a couple of her bags, but she seemed to be distracted over something.  
明日香在卧室里，正翻着几个包，但似乎被什么事情分了心。

"You go ahead first. I'll be down in a bit."  
"你先下去吧。我一会儿就下来。"

Shinji thought about asking her if she needed help, but perhaps it was something she'd rather not have help with.  
真嗣考虑是否要问她是否需要帮助，但或许这是她宁愿自己解决的事情。

He entered the hot springs after changing quickly, wading into the water and sinking down so that only his head was above the water. Letting out a low sigh, he closed his eyes and let himself float there for several minutes. He could understand why Asuka wanted to be by herself like this for a while; it was very relaxing.  
他迅速换好衣服进入温泉，涉水而入，沉下身子只露出头部在水面上。他低声叹息，闭上眼睛，让自己漂浮了几分钟。他现在能理解为什么明日香想独自一人这样待一会儿；这真的很放松。

Now that he had fully submerged himself, he didn't feel like raising his body very high above the water, owing to the cold air. Now that it was later in the day, the cold air was biting, and even Shinji would start shivering, especially if it was brushing against his bare chest. Like this though, he didn't have to worry.  
既然他已经完全浸入水中，就不太想让自己的身体在水面上抬得太高，因为冷空气的缘故。现在天色已晚，寒风刺骨，即使是真嗣也会开始发抖，特别是当冷风拂过他赤裸的胸膛时。但像这样，他就不必担心了。

Hearing the sliding door open behind him, Shinji tilted his head around to glance at Asuka. He was surprised to see that she had a towel wrapped around her body though, and her face was already red before she had even entered the hot springs.  
听到身后的滑动门打开，真嗣侧过头瞥了一眼明日香。令他惊讶的是，她身上裹着一条毛巾，而且还没进温泉，脸就已经红了。

"You aren't getting heat stroke again, are you?" asked Shinji.  
“你不会又中暑了吧？”真嗣问道。

Asuka didn't even look at him, but just walked around the edge of the water, and found a spot to submerge herself in, towel and all. Shinji thought this behavior odd, but maybe she just wanted to relax as well. Shinji could certainly agree with that mentality, and besides, there was still plenty of time to enjoy each others company later.  
明日香甚至没有看他一眼，只是沿着水边走，找到一个地方把自己连同毛巾一起浸入水中。真嗣觉得这种行为很奇怪，但也许她只是想放松一下。真嗣当然能理解这种心态，而且，之后还有很多时间可以一起享受彼此的陪伴。

Feeling far more relaxed than he had in a long time, Shinji looked up again at the sky for the third time that day. It was nice to not be worrying about training with his AT-field, or about the dwindling supply of food in the grocery store. Right now, he could just relax without a care in the world.  
久违地感到无比轻松，真嗣那天第三次抬头望向天空。不再为 AT 力场的训练烦恼，也不再担心杂货店里日益减少的食物供应，真是太好了。此刻，他可以无忧无虑地放松。

"Sh-Shinji?" “真-真嗣？”

Shinji turned his eyes away from the sky, and stared at Asuka. She was fully submerged in the water as well, but her face was still bright red.  
真嗣从天空收回目光，转向看着明日香。她同样全身浸在水中，但脸颊依旧通红。

"What is it? You aren't feel woozy again are you?"  
"怎么了？你不会又觉得头晕了吧？"

"No...I was just thinking, that I actually want to be left alone again for a while." Her voice was unnaturally high, and Shinji couldn't help but frown at this strange reaction from her.  
"不...我只是想，我真的想再一个人待一会儿。" 她的声音异常高亢，这让真嗣不禁皱眉，对她的这种奇怪反应感到不解。

"Asuka, you sure you're alright?" asked Shinji. He stood up, and began moving towards her, ignoring the bite of the cold against his chest.  
"明日香，你确定你没事吗？" 真嗣问道。他站起身，开始向她走去，无视胸前寒冷的刺痛。

"I-I'm fine!" yelled Asuka. "So really, can you please go to a different hot springs."  
"我-我没事！" 明日香大喊。"所以真的，你能去别的温泉吗。"

Shinji ignored her words, moving directly in front of her, placing his palm against her forehead. Maybe the combination of the heat and cold was actually making her sick, but she didn't seem to have a fever, though her face was red again.  
真嗣无视她的话，直接走到她面前，将手掌贴在她的额头上。也许是冷热交替真的让她生病了，但她似乎没有发烧，尽管她的脸又红了。

"Asuka...what's wrong?" asked Shinji, his face filled with puzzlement.  
"明日香...怎么了？" 真嗣问道，脸上满是困惑。

"Nothing!" she said, turning away from him and trying to move further away. Shinji didn't let her, and grabbed her arm, but was surprised when she applied more force, breaking away from his grasp.  
"没什么！" 她转过身去，试图离他更远些。真嗣没有放手，抓住了她的手臂，但当她用力挣脱时，他感到惊讶。

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

And then Shinji saw that she was still holding the towel against herself, but that it had come unwound from her body, and that the arm he had pulled on was desperately clutching it against her chest.  
然后真嗣看到她仍然用毛巾裹着自己，但毛巾已经从她身上松开，他拉住的那只手臂正拼命地将毛巾按在胸前。

"...Asuka...you're not..."  
"...明日香...你不是..."

Asuka blushed even more furiously, and sank herself immediately into the water. Shinji could only gape wordlessly as she disappeared in front of him.  
明日香的脸更红了，立刻沉入水中。真嗣只能哑口无言地看着她在他面前消失。

'Seriously,' thought Shinji, his mind growing hazy. 'What the hell were you thinking, entering the hot springs like that?'  
'说真的，'真嗣的思绪变得模糊，'你到底是怎么想的，那样闯进温泉？'

Asuka emerged behind him, having swam around him, and was now against the far side of the hot spring, her back pressed against the wall, the towel still clutched in front of her. Shinji wasn't sure whether to turn around or not, as he was now overly conscious that besides that towel, Asuka didn't have a single article of clothing covering her body. Normally, this would surely arouse him, but common sense was so far gone from this situation, that Shinji couldn't help but question Asuka's sanity.  
明日香从他身后浮现，已经游到他对面，背靠温泉的另一侧墙壁，毛巾依然紧抓在身前。真嗣不确定是否应该转身，因为他现在过于意识到，除了那条毛巾，明日香身上没有一件衣物遮体。通常情况下，这肯定会让他心动，但在这个情境中，常识早已荡然无存，真嗣不禁怀疑明日香的神智是否清醒。

"You must think I'm losing my mind, doing something like this," mumbled Asuka across from him. Shinji slowly glanced over his shoulder, but saw that Asuka was staring down into the water, but at least she was talking to him.  
"你肯定觉得我疯了，做这种事，" 明日香在他对面咕哝着。真嗣缓缓回头看了一眼，发现明日香正盯着水面，但至少她在跟他说话。

"I'll admit...it is, unusual."  
"我承认...这确实，挺不寻常的。"

'Can I help it if I want become more intimate with you,' thought Asuka silently.  
'如果我想和你更亲近，这能怪我吗？' 明日香默默地想。

It was a spur of the moment decision when she had been trying to decide which bikini she wanted to wear before Shinji had left. Asuka enjoyed it when Shinji looked at her, where once she had thought it strange. She was the only person he would ever look at with eyes that were perverted. She was his to do with what she wanted, and the same could be said of him. Asuka wanted to continue with things though. They were both sixteen, and though it had only been a little more than a year, it felt like they had already spent an eternity together. Even though there were still many years left together, Asuka was anxious, and wanted to experience more together. She was embarrassed of course, but knew fully well what she was doing when she made the conscious decision. Being alone in the hotel room and making the decision was one thing, compared to actually being in the same hot spring as Shinji. Asuka had steeled herself for this moment, but she still felt herself wavering.  
那是在她试图决定在真嗣离开前穿哪件比基尼时的一时冲动。明日香喜欢真嗣看她的样子，尽管曾经她觉得这很奇怪。她是唯一一个他会用那种变态眼神看的人。她是他的，任由他摆布，而他也是如此。明日香想要继续下去。他们都十六岁，虽然在一起的时间不过一年多一点，却感觉像是已经共度了永恒。尽管还有许多年要一起度过，明日香仍感到焦虑，渴望一起体验更多。当然，她感到害羞，但当她做出这个有意识的决定时，她完全清楚自己在做什么。独自在酒店房间里做决定是一回事，与真嗣一起泡在同一个温泉里则是另一回事。明日香已经为此刻做好了准备，但她仍然感到自己在动摇。

They stood opposite each other, neither looking at each other. Asuka was still staring at the water, and Shinji was back to staring at the sky above him. He didn't know what to say, and what did Asuka expect from him in the first place? Did she want to actually go all the way? Shinji didn't think so, but he couldn't entirely rule it out. Then what was her purpose? Did she just want to experience pleasure of a kind they hadn't experienced yet? Maybe, but Shinji wasn't sure about that either. Not even ten feet away from him, Asuka was baring herself entirely to him, attempting to entrust herself to him. Shinji wasn't honestly sure if this was a good idea. This was far closer to the 'act' then they had ever come, and uncomfortably so.  
他们面对面站着，谁也没有看对方。明日香依旧凝视着水面，而真嗣则回到了仰望天空的状态。他不知道该说什么，明日香一开始又期望他什么呢？她真的想要走到那一步吗？真嗣不这么认为，但他也无法完全排除这种可能性。那么她的目的是什么？她只是想体验一种他们尚未经历过的愉悦吗？也许吧，但真嗣对此也不确定。就在不到十英尺远的地方，明日香向他完全敞开了自己，试图将自己托付给他。真嗣真的不确定这是否是个好主意。这比他们以往任何时候都要接近那个“行为”，而且令人不安地接近。

While Shinji continued staring up at the sky, he thought he saw something falling from the heavens. Slowly, a single snow flake fell from the sky and drifted down over the hot springs, falling between Shinji and Asuka. Both of their eyes followed the snow flake, their eyes locking with each other as it vanished between them, melting just as it touched the surface of the water. Around them, more snow began to fall, and Shinji redirected his gaze to the sky, the snow beginning to fall on his face. It was a light sprinkle, nothing like a blizzard, but it was perfect for the nervous Shinji and Asuka.  
当真嗣继续凝视着天空时，他觉得自己看到了有什么东西从天而降。慢慢地，一片雪花从天空中飘落，飘过温泉，落在真嗣和明日香之间。两人的目光都追随着那片雪花，当它在他们之间消失时，他们的眼神交汇在一起，雪花刚一触到水面就融化了。周围，更多的雪花开始飘落，真嗣重新将目光投向天空，雪花开始轻轻地落在他的脸上。这是一场轻柔的细雪，不像暴风雪那样猛烈，但对紧张的真嗣和明日香来说，却恰到好处。

"Hey Shinji?" mumbled Asuka. She was looking at him now, and Shinji looked back at her.  
“嘿，真嗣？”明日香咕哝着。她现在正看着他，真嗣也回望着她。

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"You...you're not put off by me...are you?"  
“你……你不介意我……对吧？”

"How could you ask that?" asked Shinji in amazement.  
"你怎么会问这种问题？" 真嗣惊讶地问道。

"Sorry...I just needed some reaffirmation for myself."  
"对不起...我只是需要一些自我肯定。"

"Asuka, you know you're beautiful, and I know you're beautiful."  
"明日香，你知道你很美，我也知道你很美。"

Asuka gave him a small smile. Making sure that the towel was wrapped firmly around her body again, Asuka slowly rose from the water, becoming more relaxed with her near nakedness. Shinji couldn't help it, and followed her figure hungrily, his eyes lingering on the distinct line of her breasts concealed by the towel. Finally, he felt himself becoming aroused.  
明日香给了他一个浅浅的微笑。她确保毛巾紧紧裹住身体后，明日香缓缓从水中站起，逐渐放松了对近乎赤裸的自己的拘谨。真嗣无法控制自己，饥渴地追随她的身影，目光停留在毛巾遮掩下她胸部明显的轮廓上。最终，他感到自己被激起了欲望。

"I don't suppose you could not stare so much," said Asuka, her embarrassment beginning to show.  
“我想你能不能别这么盯着看，”明日香说道，她的尴尬开始显露出来。

"Sorry," said Shinji hurriedly.  
“对不起，”真嗣急忙说道。

"...It's alright...I don't suppose I can be angry at you really."  
"...没事的...我想我其实没法对你生气。"

Shinji wasn't sure where he should look in all honesty. These worries were quickly replaced by new ones though. Asuka stood up, and slowly began wading through the water towards Shinji. Nearly stuttering, Shinji held his tongue as Asuka drew closer to him. If she kissed him right now, there was a strong chance that he'd ignore all morals and attack her. Asuka didn't do this, but instead slid into position next to him, her face still very red.  
真嗣不确定自己应该看向哪里，老实说。但这些担忧很快被新的担忧所取代。明日香站起身，缓缓地涉水向真嗣走来。真嗣几乎结巴起来，当明日香越来越近时，他紧闭双唇。如果她现在吻他，他有很大可能会不顾一切道德束缚去回应她。但明日香没有这么做，而是滑到他身边，她的脸依然通红。

"Isn't this similar to what happened between us when we first discovered this place?" said Asuka.  
"这不跟我们第一次发现这个地方时的情况差不多吗？"明日香说道。

"...Yeah, except our positions were reversed...and...things were all together different then as well," mumbled Shinji.  
"...是啊，只不过我们的位置颠倒了...而且...那时候情况也完全不同，" 真嗣含糊地说道。

"I don't know if I agree with that," sighed Asuka.  
"我不确定我是否同意这一点，" 明日香叹息道。

Though they were directly next to each other, Shinji found himself unable to do anything. Normally, it was a simple matter of kissing each other when they were this close, but because of Asuka's attire, he was unable to move. What was going to happen between them?  
尽管他们紧挨着彼此，真嗣发现自己什么也做不了。通常情况下，当他们这么近的时候，亲吻对方是件简单的事，但由于明日香的装扮，他动弹不得。他们之间会发生什么呢？

"Hey Shinji...what do you want to do?"  
"嘿，真嗣...你想做什么？"

That was a bad question to ask Shinji at this moment. He wanted to grab Asuka's shoulders, and hug her, pressing her body against his. He wanted to remove that towel concealing her breasts. He wanted to kiss her deeply, while running his hand along her back. He wanted all these things and more, but all these things led to an eventual reality that he wasn't ready for.  
在这个时刻问真嗣这个问题真是糟糕透顶。他想抓住明日香的肩膀，拥抱她，将她的身体紧贴在自己身上。他想扯掉那条遮住她胸部的毛巾。他想深情地吻她，同时用手抚摸她的背部。他想要这一切，甚至更多，但所有这些都指向一个他尚未准备好的最终现实。

"At the very least kiss me," mumbled Asuka. "How do you think I feel, placing myself in this positi-"  
"至少吻我一下，"明日香喃喃道，"你以为我把自己置于这种境地，心里是什么感受-"

Shinji couldn't contain himself anymore, and did just what Asuka had asked of him. Turning towards her, he didn't spare her a second glance before he pressed his lips against hers. Asuka was surprised by this sudden change, but welcomed it whole heartedly. They kissed each other, while leaning against one another, the snow continuing to fall around them.  
真嗣再也控制不住自己，完全按照明日香的要求做了。他转向她，没有多看一眼，便将嘴唇贴在了她的唇上。明日香对这突如其来的转变感到惊讶，但全心全意地接受了。他们相拥而吻，彼此依靠，雪花继续在他们周围飘落。

Breaking off the kiss, they continued to gaze into each others eyes. Shinji was nearly at the edge of his limits, and looked into Asuka's eyes for confirmation. She was nervous, but also firm in her determination. She was ready for whatever came next.  
结束亲吻后，他们继续凝视着对方的眼睛。真嗣几乎到了极限，他望向明日香的眼睛寻求确认。她虽然紧张，但决心坚定。无论接下来发生什么，她都已做好准备。

Turning his entire body so that he was in front of her, Shinji placed a hand on Asuka's shoulder, gently caressing it. Asuka shivered at his touch, and looked back at him as though telling him to stop teasing her. Shinji removed the scrunchy from Asuka's hair which had held it in a ponytail, letting her hair fall freely into the water. He ran his hands along her back, ignoring the towel that was still wrapped there. Again, Asuka gave him a gaze which demanded him to stop teasing her, and Shinji obliged.  
真嗣转过身来，让自己完全面对着她，将手轻轻放在明日香的肩上，温柔地抚摸着。明日香因他的触碰而颤抖，回望着他，仿佛在告诉他别再逗弄她了。真嗣从明日香的头发上取下扎成马尾的发圈，让她的头发自由地散落在水中。他双手沿着她的背部滑过，忽略了仍裹在那里的毛巾。明日香再次用眼神示意他停止逗弄，真嗣顺从了。

He kissed her at the nape of the neck, gently, his lips passing over her collarbone where she was sensitive. Asuka scrunched her face up as the waves of pleasure began assaulting her. Her entire body was beginning to tingle; she was becoming aroused.  
他在她的后颈处轻轻一吻，双唇掠过她敏感的锁骨。随着一波波快感袭来，明日香皱起了脸。她的全身开始微微颤抖，情欲逐渐升腾。

Shinji continued kissing her along her neck, but instead of continued towards her lips, he started trailing his way along her shoulder. Asuka hadn't expected this route of attack, and was even more surprised when his lips started travel along her upper chest which was not concealed by the towel. Asuka's head tilted upwards as Shinji started kissing her on her neck again, trailing up to her chin, before finally finding her lips. His tongue entered her mouth, and Asuka felt her brain shut off entirely.  
真嗣继续沿着她的脖子亲吻，但没有继续向她的唇部进发，而是开始沿着她的肩膀移动。明日香没料到他会采取这样的攻势，当他的唇开始在她未被毛巾遮盖的上胸部游走时，她更加惊讶了。明日香的头向后仰起，真嗣再次开始亲吻她的脖子，一路向上到她的下巴，最终找到了她的唇。他的舌头探入她的口中，明日香感到自己的大脑完全停止了思考。

Wrapping her arms around him, Asuka pulled Shinji towards her, pressing her entire body against him. Her fingernails clawed there way along his back, and Shinji had to fight against the pain and pleasure. Asuka seemed to have lost all sense of reason though. Entrusting herself entirely to Shinji, she wrapped her legs around his waist, and ground her hips against his. Shinji hardly had enough time to support her back so she wouldn't fall over as she did this, and for a moment, thought about stopping. The stimulus of Asuka's body against his was overpowering, and Shinji's arousal was reaching a point where he felt like he'd exploding any second.  
她用双臂环抱着他，明日香将真嗣拉向自己，将整个身体紧贴着他。她的指甲在他背上划过，真嗣不得不在痛苦与快感之间挣扎。明日香似乎已经失去了所有的理智。她完全将自己托付给真嗣，双腿缠绕在他的腰间，臀部紧贴着他的磨蹭。真嗣几乎没有足够的时间支撑她的背部，以免她摔倒，有那么一刻，他考虑过停下来。明日香的身体对他的刺激太过强烈，真嗣的兴奋已经达到了一个临界点，感觉自己随时都可能爆发。

He didn't stop though, and continued kissing her, holding Asuka upright. The water rippled around them, lapping at their bodies while they continued holding each other. Asuka's breathing was starting to become more ragged, her face dyed red largely from the heat. Her eyes seemed unfocused as she let her desires overtake everything else. She didn't even seem to notice that the towel was starting to come undone behind her back.  
然而，他没有停下来，继续亲吻她，支撑着明日香站立。水波在他们周围荡漾，轻拍着他们的身体，而他们继续拥抱着彼此。明日香的呼吸开始变得急促，她的脸因热气而染上了红色。她的眼神似乎失去了焦点，任由欲望主宰一切。她甚至没有注意到身后的毛巾开始松脱。

Shinji did though, and for one wild moment, he thought about holding it in place. Instead, he ran his hands along Asuka's smooth back, now devoid of the towel. Her chest and everything below her waist to her thighs were still covered, since the towel was between them, but if they broke apart, it would certainly fall away from her. Shinji would be lying if he said he didn't want to see such a sight, but he wasn't sure whether he could handle it either. Asuka was still oblivious to this as she continued kissing Shinji, her lips glued to his.  
但真嗣确实这么做了，有那么一瞬间，他甚至考虑过保持这个姿势。然而，他还是用手沿着明日香光滑的背部抚摸，此刻她的背部已没有了毛巾的遮挡。她的胸部以及腰部以下到大腿的部分仍然被毛巾覆盖着，因为毛巾夹在他们之间，但如果他们分开，毛巾肯定会从她身上滑落。如果真嗣说他不想看到这一幕，那他就是在撒谎，但他也不确定自己是否能承受得住。明日香对此仍一无所知，她继续亲吻着真嗣，双唇紧贴着他的。

Shinji had to pause for a moment though. The combination of the heat from the hot springs and Asuka's body was starting to make him light headed, and he was aware that he was starting to become dizzy. He tried communicated this to Asuka, but her brain was still firmly shut off.  
不过，真嗣不得不暂停一下。温泉的热气和明日香的身体让他开始感到头晕目眩，他意识到自己快要晕倒了。他试图向明日香传达这一点，但她的思绪依旧封闭。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji. 'I really think I'm about to pass out.'  
'该死，'真嗣心想，'我真的觉得自己快要晕过去了。'

As he realized this, he lost his balance, and started falling backwards, taking Asuka with him. When her center of gravity suddenly shifted, only then did Asuka realize what was happening.  
当他意识到这一点时，失去了平衡，开始向后倒下，连带着明日香一起。当她的重心突然转移时，明日香这才意识到发生了什么。

"Shinji what are you-WAH-"  
“真嗣你在干什么——哇——”

Asuka had thought that what he was doing was intentional, but she didn't get a chance to confirm or deny this, as both of them went splashing into the water. Asuka's eyes had initially closed when they had submerged, but now she opened them under water. Shinji was floating slightly under her, her arms still wrapped around his back somehow. His eyes were closed, but they were twitching slightly, and Asuka quickly determined that something was wrong. Keeping her arms wrapped around him, she brought them both to the surface, breaking into the open air while the snow fell around them.  
明日香原以为他的行为是故意的，但她没有机会确认或否认这一点，因为他们俩一起溅入了水中。他们潜入水中时，明日香的眼睛最初是闭着的，但现在她在水下睁开了眼睛。真嗣在她下方微微漂浮，她的手臂不知怎么地仍然环绕在他的背上。他的眼睛闭着，但微微颤动，明日香迅速判断出有些不对劲。她保持手臂环绕着他，将他们俩一起带到水面，冲破水面进入飘雪的空气中。

"Shinji!? Answer me!" Asuka shouted at him.  
"真嗣！？回答我！" 明日香对他喊道。

"...Could you not shout?" Shinji replied to her in a low voice, his eyes still closed.  
"...你能别喊吗？" 真嗣低声回应她，眼睛依旧闭着。

"What happened?" asked Asuka, hardly lowering her voice.  
"发生了什么？" 明日香几乎没降低声音问道。

Shinji didn't reply. He was resting now, trying to calm himself. He had a splitting headache right now, and still felt lightheaded. Course, Asuka was still holding onto him, so keeping calm was something he had difficulty doing right now.  
真嗣没有回答。他现在正在休息，试图让自己平静下来。他此刻头痛欲裂，仍然感到头晕目眩。当然，明日香还在紧紧抓着他，所以保持冷静对他来说现在有些困难。

"You didn't have a vision, did you?"  
“你没有看到什么预兆，对吧？”

"No, I didn't," mumbled Shinji. "Just lightheaded is all. Doing this in a hot springs may not be the best idea."  
“没有，我只是有点头晕，”真嗣咕哝道，“在这种温泉里做这种事可能不是个好主意。”

Asuka didn't say anything to that. In truth, she could hardly remember much after the first kiss, since her body just took over everything afterwards.  
明日香对此一言未发。实际上，在第一个吻之后，她几乎记不清什么了，因为她的身体在那之后完全接管了一切。

"Do you want to call it quits then?" asked Asuka.  
“那你想就此放弃吗？”明日香问道。

"Yeah, that might be for the best," said Shinji as he opened his eyes.  
“嗯，这可能是最好的选择，”真嗣说着睁开了眼睛。

Shinji's face immediately froze as he looked at Asuka who was still holding onto him. His face turned pasty white, whereas it had been beat red before, and Asuka thought that he might be having a sudden heart attack.  
真嗣的脸在看到仍然紧抱着他的明日香时立刻僵住了。他的脸由之前的通红变得苍白如纸，明日香心想他可能突发心脏病了。

"Shinji!?" she yelled as she leaned in closer to him. Shinji's face turned multiple shades of color this time, and the thing between his legs threatened to burst out of his swimming trunks.  
“真嗣！？”她大喊着，更加靠近他。真嗣的脸这次变换了好几种颜色，而他两腿间的东西似乎要从泳裤里爆出来。

"...Asuka..." mumbled Shinji, his eyes still locked on her.  
“……明日香……”真嗣喃喃道，目光依旧锁定在她身上。

"Wha-" "什-"

And then she realized as a gust of wind came by, making her shiver uncontrollably. Looking down at herself, she noticed she was fully naked. The towel had come off while they had fallen in the water together.  
然后她意识到一阵风吹过，让她不由自主地颤抖起来。低头一看，她发现自己完全赤裸。在他们一起落水时，毛巾已经脱落了。

Under normal circumstances, Asuka would have probably screamed, and slapped Shinji, knocking him unconscious. She just stood there however, staring down at her bare chest, aware that Shinji's gaze was still penetrating her. All words escaped her, and all thoughts were driven from her mind. She didn't know how she was supposed to respond right now. But Shinji did this for her.  
在正常情况下，明日香可能会尖叫并扇真嗣一巴掌，让他昏过去。但她只是站在那里，盯着赤裸的胸部，意识到真嗣的目光仍在穿透她。所有的话语都从她口中消失，所有的思绪都被赶出了脑海。她不知道现在应该如何回应。但真嗣是为了她才这么做的。

"...Beautiful..." "...真美..."

Asuka felt like her heart was pierced at Shinji's words, and her brain was flipped back on. She dove into the water with such a large splash that Shinji had to shield his eyes. Nonetheless, he couldn't get the image of Asuka's breasts with her pink nipples out of his mind.  
听到真嗣的话，明日香感觉心被刺了一下，大脑也重新运转起来。她猛地扎进水里，溅起的水花让真嗣不得不遮住眼睛。尽管如此，明日香那粉红色乳头的胸部形象仍在他脑海中挥之不去。

Asuka remained underwater for almost a full minute, and seemed to be collecting herself. When she finally remerged, she had the towel wrapped around her again. She had retrieved it while underwater, and wrapped herself. Shinji was still standing in the same position, and had a glazed look over his eyes. Asuka could only assume what he was thinking about, and momentarily did think about hitting him. But it was her fault afterall for being so careless.  
明日香在水下待了近一分钟，似乎在整理自己的情绪。当她终于重新浮出水面时，已经用毛巾再次裹住了自己。她在水下取回了毛巾并裹好。真嗣还站在原地，眼神有些呆滞。明日香只能猜测他在想什么，有那么一瞬间她确实想揍他一顿。但毕竟，是她自己不小心造成的。

"...Shinji?" "...真嗣？"

"What?" he replied, startled at her voice.  
"什么？" 他回答道，被她的声音吓了一跳。

"I'd ask you to forget what you just saw, but I don't suppose that would be possible."  
"我本想让你忘记刚才看到的，但我想那是不可能的。"

Shinji couldn't tell whether she was angry or not. Her face seemed passive, but there was an underlying emotion that he could place.  
真嗣无法判断她是否生气。她的表情看似平静，但有一种他能够察觉的潜在情绪。

"...They're not weird, are they...my breasts?" asked Asuka in such a small voice that Shinji could hardly hear her, even though the only sound was the sound of their own breathing.  
“……它们不奇怪吧……我的胸部？”明日香用如此微弱的声音问道，真嗣几乎听不清她的话，尽管唯一的声音就是他们自己的呼吸声。

Many thoughts erupted within Shinji's mind, all more erotic than the next, but he eventually settled with a straight-  
许多念头在真嗣的脑海中爆发，一个比一个色情，但他最终还是选择了直接——

"No, they're not." “不，他们不是。”

Shinji wasn't sure whether he imagined it or not, but he thought he saw a faint smile appear on her lips. He was sure he imagined it though.  
真嗣不确定这是否只是他的想象，但他觉得他看到她的嘴角掠过一丝淡淡的微笑。不过他确信那只是他的想象。

Slowly Asuka, started approaching him, and Shinji closed his eyes, dreading the possibility of a slap, but instead she passed by him.  
慢慢地，明日香开始向他靠近，真嗣闭上了眼睛，害怕可能会挨一巴掌，但她却从他身边走了过去。

"I think that's enough excitement for one day," said Asuka as she got out of the hot springs.  
“我想今天的刺激已经够多了，”明日香说着从温泉中起身。

Shinji turned around, just in time to see her disappearing into the changing room, a frown apparent on his face. He couldn't tell what Asuka was thinking, but she probably knew what he was still thinking. He didn't think that image would leave his mind for a long while.  
真嗣转过身来，刚好看到她消失在更衣室里，脸上明显带着一丝不悦。他猜不透明日香的心思，但她大概知道他还在想什么。他觉得那幅画面短时间内不会从他脑海中消失。

---

Shinji gave Asuka plenty of time to finish changing, so that when he got back into the hotel room, she was already in a fresh pair of clothes, and just finishing drying her hair. He quickly changed into a pair of sweats and a long sleeve shirt. There was a certain level of awkwardness between them right now, but they couldn't really afford that luxury with how cold the room was.  
真嗣给了明日香足够的时间换衣服，所以当他回到酒店房间时，她已经换上了干净的衣服，正忙着吹干头发。他迅速换上运动裤和长袖衬衫。此刻他们之间有些尴尬，但在如此寒冷的房间里，他们实在无法承受这种奢侈。

Wordlessly, Asuka got into the bed, and buried herself in the blankets that they had brought from home. They were piled so high that Shinji couldn't even see Asuka's head from where he was sitting in the other room. He was surprised that she could want that much warmth after they had just left the hot springs, but then again, she couldn't handle the cold as well as himself.  
无言地，明日香爬上了床，将自己埋在他们从家里带来的被子里。被子堆得如此之高，以至于坐在另一个房间的真嗣连明日香的脑袋都看不见。他惊讶于她在刚离开温泉后还这么渴望温暖，但转念一想，她对寒冷的抵抗力确实不如自己。

Shinji couldn't very well remain in the living room the entire time though. Standing up, he walked into the bedroom, and closed the door behind him. He paused in front of the bed though, wondering why he was feeling so nervous. It had only been an accident, and it wasn't as though it was that strange. Surely it would have happened eventually, but for him to see Asuka naked in a such a way. Maybe she was feeling more embarrassed then he initially thought.  
不过，真嗣也不能一直待在客厅里。他站起身，走进卧室，并关上了身后的门。但在床前，他停了下来，疑惑自己为何感到如此紧张。那只是个意外，而且并不算特别奇怪。迟早会发生的事，但他竟然以这种方式看到了明日香赤裸的样子。或许她比他最初想的还要尴尬。

"God, if you're gonna be standing there the entire night, this is only going to get more awkward, so hurry up and get in bed."  
“天啊，如果你打算整晚站在那儿，只会越来越尴尬，快点上床吧。”

Asuka said this while buried under the covers, her voice muffled but still understandable. She seemed annoyed that Shinji was taking it like this, even though it was her body that had been seen. If it had been the other way around, she wondered if she would be reacting like this. She blushed briefly at that, remembering the feel of something against her body from earlier, but she pushed that thought away quickly.  
明日香在被子里说道，声音虽被闷住但仍能听清。她似乎对真嗣这样反应感到恼火，尽管被看到的是她的身体。如果反过来，她不知道自己会不会也这样反应。想到这里，她脸颊微微泛红，回忆起之前身体感受到的触感，但她很快将这念头抛开。

Shinji didn't reply to her, but did walk around the edge of the bed, and get in on his side. He was careful not to touch Asuka as he did this, but the image still wasn't leaving his mind.  
真嗣没有回应她，只是绕到床边，小心翼翼地躺下，尽量不碰到明日香。但那画面依旧在他脑海中挥之不去。

They lay there for several minutes in silence, until Asuka finally broke in with.  
他们沉默地躺了几分钟，直到明日香终于开口。

"You're not thinking about it, are you?"  
"你没在想那件事吧？"

She only got silence from Shinji, which ended with her striking him on the shoulder.  
她从真嗣那里只得到了沉默，最终她在他肩膀上拍了一下。

"Ouch!" "哎哟！"

"Well, say something," mumbled Asuka.  
"哎，说点什么吧，" 明日香咕哝道。

"...I meant what I said earlier," was all Shinji replied with.  
"...我之前说的都是真心的，" 真嗣只这么回答。

Asuka felt her entire body heat up at his words. She was confident in her own looks, but hearing Shinji comment on it was somehow different. She had somewhat been prepared for it when she had entered the hot springs, but she had imagined it happening in a different way. Even so, the look on Shinji's face was wonderful in a certain way.  
听到他的话，明日香感到全身都热了起来。她对自己的外貌很有自信，但听到真嗣的评价感觉却截然不同。她进入温泉时多少有所准备，但想象中的情景并非如此。即便如此，真嗣脸上的表情在某种程度上却显得格外动人。

"...Idiot," Asuka managed to say after several seconds of silence.  
"...笨蛋," 在几秒钟的沉默后，明日香勉强说道。

Even though she said this, she moved closer to Shinji. She felt him flinch when her body, and in particular her breasts, touched his own body, but this passed quickly.  
尽管她这么说，她还是向真嗣靠近了些。她感觉到当她的身体，尤其是她的胸部，触碰到他的身体时，他微微一颤，但很快这种感觉就消失了。

"Asuka, this isn't helping."  
"明日香，这没什么用。"

"I know," she mumbled, leaning towards his face and pressing her lips against his. Shinji was surprised by this sudden kiss, but was glad that the awkwardness between them had vanished.  
“我知道，”她喃喃道，向他靠近，双唇轻轻贴上他的。真嗣对这个突如其来的吻感到惊讶，但很高兴他们之间的尴尬已经消失。

Things may have continued between them, but both were feeling tired, and with the added warmth of all the blankets, the cold outside was quickly disappearing. Shinji hoped that the snow wouldn't last very long though, and was somewhat worried about the drive tomorrow, but that was afterall tomorrow. Ignoring these worries about what may happen, he quickly fell asleep.  
事情本可能在他们之间继续发展，但两人都感到疲惫，加上所有毯子带来的温暖，外面的寒冷很快消散了。真嗣希望雪不会持续太久，尽管他对明天的驾驶有些担忧，但那毕竟是明天的事。抛开这些对可能发生的事情的担忧，他很快便睡着了。

Snuggling up to him, Asuka closed her eyes. Every extra step was another shift in their relationship, but Asuka still wanted more. Her imagination began to rove, as unbidden images of her and Shinji rose up, and her body started to tighten up. She wanted that, but she could settle for what they had right now. Eventually, she would be happy to give her all to him.  
依偎在他身边，明日香闭上了眼睛。每多走一步，他们的关系就又改变了一些，但明日香仍渴望更多。她的想象力开始游走，不由自主地浮现出她和真嗣的画面，身体也开始紧绷。她渴望那些，但此刻她满足于他们所拥有的。最终，她会心甘情愿地将自己完全交给他。

'Afterall, towards Shinji, I-'  
'毕竟，对于真嗣，我——'

Asuka stopped herself there. She didn't feel this was the time to be thinking about that.  
明日香在那里停了下来。她觉得现在不是想这些的时候。

Trying to ignore these feelings, and the thoughts that were circling in her mind, she slowly fell asleep, where her thoughts were filled with Shinji. But as to what the contents of the dreams were, Asuka would rather die than speak them out loud, especially to Shinji.  
试图忽略这些感觉和脑海中盘旋的想法，她慢慢睡着了，梦中充满了真嗣。但至于梦的内容是什么，明日香宁愿死也不会大声说出来，尤其是对真嗣。

**Fairly certain that I toed the line alright in this chapter, and didn't go too far into explicit territory. I did consider making it a bit more erotic, but decided against that. That will be for the next chapters, so those will likely have A/N warnings before strong mature content.  
相当确定这一章我把握得还不错，没有太过深入到露骨的领域。我确实考虑过让它更情色一些，但最终决定不这么做。那将会留给接下来的章节，所以那些章节可能会在强烈成熟内容前加上 A/N 警告。**

**Speaking of the next chapters, I've decided to move up the time frame of the second half, so with that said, we'll have three more chapters until that point. Enjoy  
说到接下来的章节，我决定将后半部分的时间线提前，因此，在此之前，我们将会有三章内容。敬请期待。**

### Chapter 27: Lust
欲望  

**So, incredibly early update here, and I'll talk about why at the end, among other things. This chapter is much stronger M than last one (chapter title says it all), and does have two A/N for content which some people may not want to read. As usual look for the bold lettering for the alert.  
所以，这里是一个非常早的更新，我会在最后解释原因，以及其他一些事情。这一章比上一章（从章节标题就能看出来）更加成人向，并且包含两个 A/N，内容可能有些人不想阅读。一如既往地，请留意加粗字体以获取提示。**

The months had passed since winter, and it was now close to summer once again. Gone were the cold days spent bundled up next to each other, replaced with the natural warmth of a sunny afternoon. As was usual with the passing of the months, Shinji and Asuka continued to mature and grow, both in body, and in mind. It was now more than a year since they had settled down in their house, and you could almost consider them a young married couple for how they acted. Their feelings for each other continued to grow along with their bodies, but they relatively maintained the same distance with each other. But things had changed.  
自从冬天过去，现在又接近夏天了。那些寒冷的日子里他们紧紧依偎在一起的时光已经不复存在，取而代之的是阳光明媚的下午带来的自然温暖。随着月份的流逝，真嗣和明日香继续在身体和心灵上成熟成长。自从他们在这个房子里安定下来已经超过一年了，他们的行为几乎可以被视为一对年轻的夫妇。他们对彼此的感情随着身体的成长而不断加深，但他们之间相对保持着同样的距离。但事情已经发生了变化。

As was usual, Shinji was the first to awake in the morning. A bead of sunlight pierced through a gap in the blinds of their window, and Shinji's eyes fluttered open slowly. His arm was outstretched in front of him, and there was a certain weight pressing down on it. Asuka was using his arm as a pillow as she continued to sleep, her mouth slightly agape while she breathed softly, still deep within her dreams. Shinji watched her cute face for several seconds, before he carefully removed his arm from under her. She didn't wake up, which he was thankful for, but then again, he wasn't very surprised at this either.  
一如既往，清晨总是真嗣第一个醒来。一缕阳光透过窗帘的缝隙，真嗣的眼皮缓缓抬起。他的手臂向前伸展，上面压着某种重量。明日香正枕着他的手臂继续沉睡，嘴巴微微张开，呼吸轻柔，依旧沉浸在梦乡之中。真嗣凝视着她可爱的脸庞几秒钟，然后小心翼翼地从她身下抽出手臂。她没有醒来，这让他感到庆幸，不过对此他也不感到意外。

Leaving the bed, he put on a t-shirt and pants and looked over at Asuka once again. She had tossed in her sleep in the short time he had left the bed, and he could see her cleavage thanks to the loose fitting shirt she was wearing. Not for the first time, nor the last, did he imagine exploring that valley that was hidden to him. Once or twice since the incident at the hot springs he had come close, but there was always a cut off point.  
离开床铺，他穿上 T 恤和裤子，再次看向明日香。她在短暂的睡眠中翻了个身，宽松的衬衫让她露出了胸前的曲线。这不是他第一次，也不会是最后一次，想象着探索那片对他隐藏的深谷。自从温泉事件以来，他曾一度或两次接近，但总有一个界限在那里。

Sighing lightly, he began to leave the room, but paused once again as his eyes noticed a stain on the white carpet of their bedroom. Shaking his head, he left the bedroom to prepare breakfast.  
他轻叹一声，正要离开房间，却在目光扫过卧室白色地毯上的污渍时再次停下。他摇了摇头，离开卧室去准备早餐。

During the winter months when they had been cooped up in the house for long periods at a time, Asuka had found an easy way to pass the time on occasion. Her solution, was alcohol of course. It had been several months now since they had depleted all the canned goods in the grocery store, but the alcoholic beverages hadn't been touched yet, which Asuka had quickly latched onto. There had been many times during the winter months when she had flat out passed out, and Shinji had to carry her upstairs. She didn't seem to care whether the alcohol was lukewarm or not, but she had quickly grown accustomed to sake, which as an added bonus, was normally drunken warm.  
在漫长的冬季里，他们长时间被困在屋内，偶尔间，明日香找到了一种消磨时光的简单方法。她的解决之道当然是酒精。几个月前，他们已经耗尽了杂货店里的所有罐头食品，但酒精饮料却还未曾动过，明日香很快就抓住了这个机会。在冬季的许多时候，她会直接醉倒，而真嗣不得不把她抱上楼。她似乎并不介意酒精是温的还是冷的，但她很快就习惯了喝温热的清酒，这算是个额外的福利。

This wasn't to say that Shinji didn't occasionally drink as well. He wasn't nearly as fond of sake as Asuka was though, and tended to go for liquor, but was always careful to never get so drunk he lost control of himself. Asuka could get rather ferocious whenever she got drunk, and Shinji had lost track of how many times he had kissed her while the taste of alcohol was on her breath. She knew her limit, but she always tried to get a reaction out of Shinji. He was always adamant though, that whatever she tried, he wouldn't go along with since her actions weren't her own. Shinji wasn't sure how many of these incidents Asuka actually remembered the next morning when she woke up, but she never mentioned it, and neither did Shinji. Once, she had stripped down to nothing but her underwear, and then tried to force Shinji to do the same, but he had put his foot down at that, and gotten angry at her. The stain on the carpet of their bedroom was a result of that night, after Asuka had thrown up her dinner.  
这并不是说真嗣偶尔不喝酒。他虽然不像明日香那样喜欢清酒，更倾向于选择烈酒，但总是小心翼翼，从不让自己醉到失去自控。明日香一醉就会变得相当凶猛，真嗣已经记不清有多少次在她的呼吸中带着酒气时吻过她。她知道自己的极限，但总是试图从真嗣那里得到反应。然而，真嗣总是坚决表示，无论她尝试什么，他都不会配合，因为她的行为并非出自本意。真嗣不确定明日香第二天醒来时究竟记得多少这些事情，但她从未提起，真嗣也没有。有一次，她脱得只剩内衣，然后试图强迫真嗣也这么做，但他坚决拒绝了，并对她发火。那天晚上，明日香把晚餐吐在了卧室的地毯上，留下了污渍。

Shinji wasn't sure whether Asuka did all this because she was bored, or if she just wanted him to try something. Her defenses were entirely down whenever these things happened, but Shinji could never bring himself to touch her. It would be far too wrong to take advantage of her in such a state.  
真嗣不确定明日香这么做是因为无聊，还是只想让他尝试些什么。每当这种事情发生时，她的防御完全放下，但真嗣始终无法让自己去触碰她。在这种状态下占她便宜，实在是太不应该了。

Shinji took his time preparing breakfast, since he knew it would be a while before Asuka made her way downstairs. She had gotten rather drunk last night, and had collapsed on the bed, immediately falling into a dreamless, drunken sleep. She didn't try anything towards Shinji, but even so, he had remained downstairs for several hours even after she had fallen asleep. He would be lying if he wasn't worried sometimes about Asuka's drinking problem, but he hoped that it was simply a phase she was going through. She was old enough to make her own decisions, and even if Shinji did occasionally voice his opinion, she would usually brush him off.  
真嗣慢慢准备早餐，因为他知道明日香还要过一会儿才会下楼。她昨晚喝得相当醉，一倒在床上就立刻陷入了无梦的酣睡。她对真嗣没有任何举动，即便如此，她睡着后他还是在楼下待了几个小时。如果说他有时不担心明日香的酗酒问题，那他就是在撒谎，但他希望这只是她正在经历的一个阶段。她已经足够成熟，可以自己做决定了，即使真嗣偶尔表达自己的看法，她通常也会置之不理。

Letting out a low sigh, Shinji let their small grill continued spouting flames, not quite feeling hungry enough to make his own portion of food. He leaned back in the wicker chair on the back patio, looking across the lawn.  
真嗣低声叹了口气，任由他们的小烤架继续喷出火焰，他并不怎么感到饿，所以没有为自己准备食物。他靠在后院里的柳条椅上，眺望着草坪。

He couldn't express himself as feeling angry towards Asuka, but he was significantly annoyed with her sometimes when she got so drunk she lost control of herself. His feelings for her weren't going to change because of that, but still, he wished that they could go further. The image of her naked body was still firmly ingrained within his mind, and he had used it many times when the urge hit him, but just imagining was no longer satisfying. He wanted that sight again, with physical contact between them. Asuka had already bared herself before Shinji, so wasn't it his turn now?  
他对明日香并没有生气的情绪，但有时她喝得烂醉如泥、失去控制时，他确实会感到相当恼火。他对她的感情不会因此改变，但尽管如此，他还是希望他们能更进一步。她赤裸的身体形象仍深深烙印在他的脑海中，每当冲动袭来，他多次以此为慰藉，但仅凭想象已不再满足。他渴望再次见到那一幕，并希望彼此间能有身体接触。明日香已经在真嗣面前展露过自己，那么现在不正是轮到他的时候了吗？

As wild images began assaulting his mind, he became aware that he was quickly growing hard. He tried banishing these thoughts away quickly, but try as he might, his thoughts continued drifting back to Asuka, and all the things he wanted to experience with her.  
当狂野的画面开始冲击他的思绪时，他意识到自己正迅速变得坚硬。他试图迅速驱散这些念头，但无论他如何努力，思绪仍不断飘回明日香，以及他渴望与她经历的一切。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji as the pressure in his pants started growing tighter. He still felt disgusted with himself whenever this happened, and unfortunately, it was happening far more often than he was comfortable with. Maybe it was because of Asuka's drunken advances, but he was having to release his pent up tension far more often than he used to. Right now though...was he really going to do that while sitting out here on the patio?  
“该死，”真嗣心想，随着裤子里的压力越来越紧。每当这种情况发生时，他仍然感到厌恶自己，不幸的是，这种情况比他愿意承认的还要频繁。也许是因为明日香醉酒的挑逗，但他现在不得不比以前更频繁地释放积压的紧张情绪。不过现在……他真的要坐在这里的露台上做那件事吗？

Before Shinji was about to make a possible life altering decision, the sliding door opened, and Asuka stepped outside. In many ways, this did nothing to improve Shinji's situation, but at least he hadn't been in the middle of unbuttoning his pants. Asuka it seemed was still half asleep though, so she didn't notice anything unusual about Shinji's expression.  
在真嗣即将做出可能改变一生的决定之前，滑动门打开了，明日香走了出来。在许多方面，这并没有改善真嗣的处境，但至少他还没有开始解开裤扣。不过，明日香似乎还半睡半醒，所以她没有注意到真嗣的表情有什么异常。

Sinking down into the chair beside him, she tilted her head back and placed both her hands over her face. Shinji assumed that she had a headache, but he wasn't about to console her because of her decision.  
她沉沉地坐进他旁边的椅子，头向后仰，双手捂住脸。真嗣猜她可能是头痛，但他并不打算因为她的决定而安慰她。

"Isn't breakfast done yet?" mumbled Asuka.  
"早餐还没好吗？" 明日香咕哝道。

"I honestly didn't think you'd be up this early, so I took my time preparing it."  
"老实说，我没想到你会这么早起，所以就慢慢准备了。"

Asuka simply groaned. If she felt this bad, she probably should have just continued sleeping Shinji thought. Well, now that she was up at least, he supposed he may as well finish.  
明日香只是哼了一声。如果她感觉这么糟糕，真嗣想，她或许应该继续睡下去。不过，既然她已经起来了，他觉得还是把早餐做完吧。

Shinji busied himself with the grill, while simultaneously preparing coffee, more for Asuka than himself. It was instant stuff, but better than nothing. Asuka stirred slightly as he passed her a mug, and slowly sipped the coffee while continuing to groan about her headache. Shinji did his best to ignore her mumblings while he poured some batter into a pan, making pancakes.  
真嗣忙着打理烤架，同时也在为明日香准备咖啡，虽然对他自己来说不过是速溶的，但总比没有好。明日香在他递过杯子时微微动了动，慢慢地啜饮着咖啡，一边继续抱怨她的头痛。真嗣尽力不去理会她的嘟囔，一边将面糊倒入平底锅中，做起煎饼来。

After about twenty minutes, he passed her a plate with two fluffy pancakes, to which she immediately started digging into. With it fresh off the grill, it seared the inside of her mouth, but it helped to further wake her up at least. By the time that Shinji was starting on his own, she had woken up considerably, but her headache was still bothering her.  
大约二十分钟后，他递给她一盘两个松软的煎饼，她立刻开始大快朵颐。刚从烤架上拿下来的煎饼烫伤了她的口腔内部，但至少这有助于她进一步清醒。等到真嗣开始享用自己的那份时，明日香已经明显清醒了许多，但她的头痛依旧困扰着她。

Asuka stood up, and walked inside the house, leaving Shinji to himself out on the patio. After he finished, he cleaned the dishes in the sink, noticing that Asuka had laid down on the couch, her eyes closed as she tried to ignore the pain. He sighed lightly, wondering how much more he could take of this.  
明日香站起身，走进屋内，留下真嗣独自在露台上。他完成后，在洗碗池里清洗餐具，注意到明日香已经躺在沙发上，双眼紧闭，试图忽视疼痛。他轻叹一声，不知道自己还能忍受多久。

Without having anything further to do, he walked into the living room, sitting down on their leather chair, and then looked over at Asuka. Shinji was reaching a point where he had started considering to hide the alcohol from her if this continued, which was something that he really didn't want to do. Asuka wasn't a child that you'd hide stuff from when she threw a temper tantrum.  
无所事事之下，他走进客厅，坐在他们的皮椅上，然后看向明日香。真嗣已经到了考虑如果这种情况继续下去，是否要对她隐瞒酒精的地步，这是他真的不想做的事情。明日香并不是一个你会因为她发脾气而隐瞒事情的孩子。

"Shinji?" Asuka spoke to him quietly.  
“真嗣？”明日香轻声对他说。

"...Yeah?" asked Shinji while he continued looking at her. Asuka turned towards him slightly, outstretching her hand towards him. Shinji hesitated briefly, before placing his hand in hers. Asuka gently tugged on his arm, guiding him off the chair and towards the couch. She sat up briefly so that Shinji could sit beside her, and then slowly collapsed on top of him, pressing her body against him. Shinji didn't even feel any desires stirring within him as she did this, and just calmly accepted her.  
“……嗯？”真嗣一边继续看着她一边问道。明日香微微转向他，伸出一只手。真嗣犹豫了一下，然后将手放在她的手上。明日香轻轻地拉了拉他的手臂，引导他离开椅子走向沙发。她短暂地坐起来，以便真嗣可以坐在她旁边，然后慢慢地倒在他身上，将身体紧贴着他。真嗣在她这样做的时候甚至没有感到任何欲望的涌动，只是平静地接受了她。

"...Sorry," mumbled Asuka.  
"...对不起," 明日香咕哝道。

Shinji had heard this multiple times before now, and the word had quickly worm off. If Asuka was showing remorse over her actions, then she going about it the wrong way.  
真嗣之前已经多次听到过这句话，这个词很快就失去了效力。如果明日香对自己的行为感到懊悔，那么她的表达方式显然不对。

Shinji didn't say anything to her, but just calmly rested his hand against her back, softly stroking her hair. Asuka let out a calm breath while he did this, pressing her face into his chest and rubbing her face against it. He couldn't refuse her, even if he wanted to. It wasn't something he wanted to do, but even so, he didn't want this to continue.  
真嗣没有对她说什么，只是平静地将手放在她的背上，轻轻抚摸着她的头发。明日香在他这样做的时候，轻轻地呼出一口气，将脸埋进他的胸膛，并在上面蹭了蹭。即使他想拒绝，也无法做到。这不是他想做的事情，但即便如此，他也不希望这种情况继续下去。

Asuka was starting to feel better though, thanks to Shinji's gentle caresses. Her headache was slowly starting to wear off, and she moved her face closer to Shinji's. She was unsure whether he'd accept her for how she was right now, but as she tenderly placed her lips against his, testing the waters, Shinji kissed her back as well. Afterall, Shinji couldn't refuse her.  
尽管如此，由于真嗣温柔的爱抚，明日香开始感觉好些了。她的头痛逐渐消退，她将脸庞贴近真嗣。她不确定他是否会接受现在的自己，但当她温柔地将双唇贴上他的，试探性地，真嗣也回吻了她。毕竟，真嗣无法拒绝她。

For a moment, Asuka's headache disappeared while they kissed. She felt tired, though exhausted might have been a better description. She knew that what she had been doing was wrong, but she felt there was no better way to calm herself. Initially, drinking had been just a simple way to pass the time, but it had grown into something else. With every passing day, Asuka was aware of the pain she felt whenever she was held, or kissed by Shinji. This pain was something that had started in her heart, and quickly spread to her entire body. Drinking had quickly become a means to forget about this pain. The truth was that she desperately wanted Shinji, but because of her own limitations and decisions, was unable to break through to this point. When she was drunk, she was free, able to commit to things which she normally couldn't commit to, even if she knew this was wrong. She was no longer satisfied with pleasuring herself, and doing it while drunk only made it worse.  
有那么一刻，当他们亲吻时，明日香的头痛消失了。她感到疲惫，尽管用筋疲力尽来形容或许更贴切。她知道自己在做的事是错误的，但她觉得没有更好的方法来平复自己。起初，喝酒只是打发时间的一种简单方式，但渐渐地演变成了别的东西。随着每一天的过去，明日香都能感受到每当被真嗣拥抱或亲吻时，心中涌出的痛苦迅速蔓延至全身。这种痛苦始于内心，并迅速扩散到她的整个身体。喝酒很快成了忘却这种痛苦的手段。事实上，她迫切地想要真嗣，但由于自身的局限和选择，她无法突破这一点。醉酒时，她是自由的，能够做出平时不敢承诺的事情，即便她知道这是错的。她不再满足于自我愉悦，而醉酒时这样做只会让情况更糟。

Asuka broke off the kiss from Shinji, and sat upright on his waist. Just the fact that she didn't feel anything from Shinji's waist made it abundantly clear that he didn't feel anything from her right now, even if they had just kissed.  
明日香从真嗣的吻中抽离，直挺挺地坐在他的腰上。仅仅是因为她没有从真嗣的腰间感受到任何东西，这一点就足以清楚地表明，即使他们刚刚接吻，他现在也没有从她那里感受到任何东西。

"Something wrong?" asked Shinji.  
“有什么不对劲吗？”真嗣问道。

"No, it's nothing," replied Asuka. Moments later, she got off the couch, and slowly made her way back upstairs.  
“不，没什么，”明日香回答。片刻后，她从沙发上起身，缓缓地走回楼上。

Shinji watched her leave, only imagining what was going through her mind. Even with the breakfast they had just had, he could very faintly taste the staleness of alcohol on her breath. Needless to say, he didn't enjoy this. Shinji felt like they were slowly growing further apart because of this, and it seemed that Asuka felt so as well.  
真嗣目送她离去，只能想象她心中所想。尽管刚刚共进早餐，他仍能隐约从她呼吸中嗅到酒精的陈腐味。不用说，他并不喜欢这样。真嗣觉得他们正因这逐渐疏远，而明日香似乎也有同感。

Scratching the back of his head, Shinji left the couch and then walked outside onto the back patio. He wasn't sure what to do, but he didn't think the answer existed inside a bottle.  
真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，离开沙发，走到外面的后阳台。他不确定该做什么，但觉得答案并不存在于酒瓶之中。

---

Upstairs, Asuka threw herself down on the bed, and rolled over onto her back. Even though she had passed out drunk last night, she hardly felt like she had gotten any sleep. When she wasn't drunk, she tossed and turned, her thoughts alive with Shinji, aware that he was sleeping beside her. She wasn't able to concentrate during the day, and her appetite had been plummeting recently. She felt sick, like their was a parasite infesting her body and feeding off of her.  
楼上，明日香扑倒在床上，翻身仰躺。尽管昨晚醉得不省人事，她几乎感觉自己没怎么睡。清醒时，她辗转反侧，满脑子都是真嗣，意识到他就睡在旁边。她白天无法集中精神，食欲也近来急剧下降。她感到不适，仿佛体内有寄生虫在侵蚀并吸取她的养分。

Despite all this, the brief kiss she had shared with Shinji was enough to arouse her. It didn't take much for her to become excited anymore, and many times she had woken up in the middle of the night, aware of a slight moistness seeping between her legs. It was times like those when she stole downstairs in the middle of the night to relieve her tension, her face buried into the pillows on the couch as her voice screamed into the soft fabric. She had no idea whether Shinji knew about these sleepless night, but she sincerely hoped not.  
尽管如此，她与真嗣那短暂的亲吻已足以激起她的欲望。她不再需要太多就能兴奋起来，许多次她半夜醒来，感觉到双腿间微微的湿润。每当这种时候，她会悄悄下楼，在沙发上用枕头掩面，声音在柔软的织物中尖叫，以缓解紧张。她不知道真嗣是否知晓这些无眠之夜，但她真心希望他不知情。

She couldn't take this much longer, and it was just a matter of time before she lost control. She wondered how Shinji could put up with her, in many senses. She wasn't stupid, and knew he wanted her as well, but he was holding back. It wasn't possible that he was still worried about his unusual self, since he had overcome that long ago. So how was he able to hold back against her? Asuka knew he looked at her with such desires, but she no longer wanted him to just look at her, his thoughts concealed.  
她无法再忍受更久了，失控只是时间问题。她想知道真嗣是如何忍受她的，从多方面来说。她并不愚蠢，知道他也想要她，但他却在克制。他不可能是还在担心自己的异常，因为他早已克服了那些。那么，他是如何在她面前克制自己的呢？明日香知道他用那样的渴望眼神看她，但她不再希望他只是看着她，心思深藏。

None of these thoughts were helping Asuka to relieve these feelings though. Even if it was no longer enough, she couldn't ignore her body which was starting to tingle.  
然而，这些想法并没有帮助明日香缓解这些情绪。即使这已不再足够，她也无法忽视自己开始感到刺痛的身体。

She was confident in herself. She had always been considered beautiful, but it was possible that somebody could easily mistake her for a woman in their early twenties, instead of a teenage, sixteen year old girl. In the nearly two years since she had woken up in Tokyo-3, Asuka's body had certainly changed to that of a woman. Her hips were curved perfectly, her legs slender, her breasts supple and full, while her butt voluptuous. Asuka was attractive, simple enough.  
她对自己充满信心。一直以来，她都被认为很美丽，但有人可能会轻易误以为她是个二十出头的女性，而不是一个十六岁的少女。自从近两年前在东京-3 醒来后，明日香的身材确实变成了一个成熟女性的模样。她的臀部曲线完美，双腿修长，胸部柔软而丰满，臀部丰满诱人。明日香很迷人，这一点毋庸置疑。

When Asuka had first met Shinji, she had thought nothing of him. He was just a stupid boy, timid, indecisive, a bore, and somebody who she could never imagine spending the rest of her life with. As she grew to know him though, she realized that he could be shy, tender, caring, and stubborn. She had quickly become used to his presence always beside her, and counted him as a friend, and then started to show affection towards him. Shinji was now quickly become a young man in his own right. His natural muscles had started developing, his voice had grown deeper, his face, though she had initially thought nothing of it, had steadily seemed to grow more pleasing in her eyes, and his shaggy hair she frequently found herself twirling her fingers around. And now, she wanted nothing more than to have him pleasure her.  
当明日香第一次遇见真嗣时，她对他毫无感觉。他不过是个愚蠢的男孩，胆小、优柔寡断、无趣，她从未想过会与他共度余生。但随着了解的深入，她发现他可以害羞、温柔、体贴且固执。她很快就习惯了他的陪伴，将他视为朋友，并开始对他表现出好感。真嗣正迅速成长为一个真正的年轻人。他的肌肉自然地开始发育，声音变得低沉，尽管她起初并不在意，但他的脸庞似乎逐渐变得顺眼，而他那蓬乱的头发，她发现自己常常不自觉地用手指缠绕。如今，她别无所求，只希望他能让她感到愉悦。

**(A/N: Following paragraphs depict scenes of masturbation. If you don't want to read this, skip to the next bold faced lettering.)  
(作者注：以下段落描述自慰场景。如果您不想阅读，请跳至下一段粗体字部分。)**

Asuka's body gave a sudden jolt, while she continued thinking about Shinji. She wanted him to kiss her tenderly, his hands running down the length of her back. She wanted his eyes to rove along her naked body, his hands gliding there way along her navel, until they finally found there way to her breasts. She wanted him to see all her tender spots, to feel the wetness between her legs.  
明日香的身躯突然一震，她继续想着真嗣。她渴望他温柔地吻她，双手沿着她的背部滑下。她希望他的目光在她赤裸的身体上游走，双手顺着她的肚脐滑行，最终找到通往她胸部的路径。她想要他看到她所有的敏感点，感受她双腿间的湿润。

As she thought this, Asuka's hand began gravitating towards the spot between her legs. She was wearing shorts, but even then, she could feel the wetness spreading through the cotton. Her hands slipped down her shorts, and she pressed a finger against that spot, her finger sinking into the soft flesh covered by her underwear which was steadily growing slicker. Her thoughts of Shinji continued while she did this, only imagining what it would feel like if he was doing this.  
这样想着，明日香的手开始向双腿间的部位移动。她穿着短裤，但即便如此，她仍能感觉到湿润透过棉布扩散开来。她的手滑进短裤，用手指按住那个部位，指尖陷入被内裤覆盖的柔软肉体中，内裤逐渐变得湿润。她一边这样做，一边继续想着真嗣，只是想象如果是他在做这件事会是什么感觉。

While her one hand focused on the spot between her legs, the other found its way to her breasts, slipping under her shirt and cupping her breast. The shirt was pulled up, revealing the white bra which covered them, but Asuka's hand slipped into the bra. Her breathing was growing ragged now, and she winced as her finger brushed against her erect nipple. Again, her thoughts of Shinji coincided as she pleasured herself.  
她的一只手专注于双腿之间的敏感地带，另一只手则摸索到自己的胸部，滑入衬衫下，轻握住乳房。衬衫被拉起，露出覆盖其上的白色胸罩，但明日香的手却滑进了胸罩内。她的呼吸变得急促，当手指轻触到挺立的乳头时，她不禁皱眉。此时，她的思绪再次与真嗣交织，她在自我愉悦中沉沦。

Becoming lost in her own pleasure, she bit her tongue, holding back the cry of ecstasy. She didn't care about her appearance, her mind only focusing on relieving this feeling. Her underwear was thoroughly soaked, but she didn't care. Her hand which had been focusing on her tender spot, plunged into her underwear, where she slowly inserted her finger. Her other hand continued focusing on her breast, rolling around her pink nipple with the occasional pinch.  
沉浸在自我欢愉中，她咬紧舌尖，压抑住即将脱口而出的欢愉呼喊。她不在乎自己的形象，心中只想着如何缓解这份感觉。内裤早已湿透，但她毫不在意。专注于敏感地带的那只手，探入内裤，缓缓插入手指。另一只手则继续在乳房上徘徊，不时轻捏那粉嫩的乳头。

All too suddenly, Asuka felt her body shudder, and she turned her face, forcing it into the pillow as she reached her climax. Her scream was muffled by the pillow, but it still echoed around the room. She was breathing raggedly, but for the moment lay still, her finger still touching her spot while her legs were tucked together.  
突然间，明日香感到身体一阵颤抖，她转过头，将脸埋进枕头，随着高潮的到来，她的尖叫被枕头闷住，但仍回荡在房间里。她呼吸急促，但此刻静静地躺着，手指仍触碰着敏感点，双腿紧贴在一起。

Slowly, she rolled over onto her back, removing her hand from her underwear and her breast. Her shorts were halfway down her thighs, and her shirt was still hiked up far enough to see her one bare breast. Asuka continued panting while she lay there, but she knew she couldn't stay like this.  
她慢慢地翻身仰躺，从内裤和胸部移开手。短裤滑落到大腿中部，衬衫仍高高撩起，露出一只裸露的乳房。明日香继续喘息着躺在那里，但她知道不能一直这样下去。

**(A/N: Ends here) (作者注：至此结束)**

Leaving the bed, she grabbed a change of clothes and entered the bathroom, stripping everything off. Wiping herself down, she examined herself in the mirror, suddenly feeling lonely. This was only a temporary thing, which she knew. There was only so far the imagination could go before it began to long for the real thing.  
她离开床铺，抓起一套干净衣服走进浴室，脱去所有衣物。擦拭着身体，她在镜中审视自己，突然感到一阵孤寂。她知道这只是暂时的。想象终究有限，一旦超越界限，便会渴望真实。

Returning to the bed, Asuka collapsed once more on it, glad that there hadn't been any stain resulting from her climax. It wasn't enough, and would probably never be enough. Unwillingly, Asuka's thoughts drifted to Shinji again, but the only thing she thought was-  
回到床上，明日香再次瘫倒，庆幸高潮并未留下任何痕迹。这远远不够，或许永远都不够。不情愿地，明日香的思想再次飘向真嗣，但她心中所想的只有——

'I wonder how different it would feel to have Shinji's fingers touch me?'  
'如果换成真嗣的手指触碰我，感觉会有何不同呢？'

---

The day passed by slowly, and Shinji kept to himself downstairs. He tried to keep his mind occupied on anything other than Asuka, but found this difficult. He had been reading a book, but had kept rereading the same paragraph and eventually started skimming through it, at this point giving up, and just placed it beside him on the couch.  
日子缓缓流逝，真嗣独自待在楼下。他试图让自己的思绪远离明日香，却发现这很难做到。他一直在看书，却不断重复阅读同一句话，最终开始略读，这时他放弃了，只是将书放在沙发旁。

He still hadn't come to a satisfactory decision, debating on what to do. Asuka had continued pushing him further and further to his limits with her drunken advances, and each time Shinji had pushed her away. He wanted to accept her, but couldn't when she acted that way. Whatever would happen between them, Shinji didn't want to be the only one to remember it. The first time had to be something special, even if it would be unbelievably awkward. There was no other thought in Shinji's mind, but this. The problem was how Asuka was behaving.  
他仍未做出满意的决定，纠结于该怎么做。明日香借着酒意向他步步紧逼，每次真嗣都推开了她。他想接受她，但当她那样表现时却做不到。无论他们之间会发生什么，真嗣不希望只有自己记得。第一次必须是特别的，即使会无比尴尬。真嗣心中别无他想，问题在于明日香的行为。

'And speaking of such,' thought Shinji as he heard the sound of soft feet walking down the stairs.  
“说到这个，”真嗣听到轻轻的脚步声从楼梯上传来，心中暗想。

Shinji glanced over towards the hallway just as Asuka entered. She had changed her clothes from earlier, but was still dressed loosely in shorts and a t-shirt. Shinji was wondering what she had been doing upstairs for these past hours, but he wasn't going to ask. Asuka sat down on the couch beside him though, far closer than he would have expected considering the distance between them earlier.  
真嗣瞥向走廊，正好看到明日香走进来。她换了衣服，但依旧穿着宽松的短裤和 T 恤。真嗣好奇她刚才在楼上做了什么，但并没有问出口。明日香坐在了他旁边的沙发上，比他预想的要近得多，考虑到之前他们之间的距离。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji. “明日香？”真嗣问道。

Asuka didn't immediately look at him, her gaze fixed in front of her. Slowly though, she turned to face him, and Shinji noticed that her moments seemed a little strange. Before he was able to say anything else though, Asuka darted across the couch, and pushed him down, wrapping her arms around him. This was certainly a change from earlier, and Shinji wasn't sure what to make of it, but that was when Asuka kissed him, and he understood what was happening.  
明日香没有立即看向他，目光固定在前方。不过，她慢慢地转过头来，真嗣注意到她的动作有些奇怪。还没等他说些什么，明日香突然扑到沙发上，将他推倒，双臂环绕着他。这和之前的情况大相径庭，真嗣一时不知所措，但就在这时，明日香吻了他，他明白了正在发生的事情。

'She's been drinking,' thought Shinji as he tasted the alcohol on her breath as her tongue entered his mouth. Shinji didn't respond to this desperate display of affection, only wondering how she could be drinking when it was hardly past noon at this point. Besides, how the hell could she be drunk when she never even came downstairs? Did she have a bottle stashed upstairs somewhere?  
“她喝了酒。”真嗣想着，当她的舌头伸进他的嘴里时，他尝到了她呼吸中的酒精味。真嗣没有回应这种绝望的示爱，只是疑惑她怎么会在这种时候喝酒，毕竟现在才刚过中午。而且，她怎么可能醉了，她甚至都没下楼来？难道她在楼上藏了瓶酒？

Shinji didn't get any chance to ask her though, as Asuka continued her feverish kissing of him. Shinji didn't think she was truly drunk, since she seemed conscious enough, unlike how she sometimes was, but this was still not something he wanted.  
然而，真嗣没有机会问她，因为明日香继续狂热地吻着他。真嗣不认为她真的醉了，因为她看起来足够清醒，不像有时那样，但这仍然不是他想要的。

Just as he was about to push her off him though, Asuka leaned back and looked down at Shinji. She was smiling, but her eyes seemed sad.  
正当他准备推开她时，明日香却往后一仰，低头看着真嗣。她在微笑，但眼神中似乎带着悲伤。

"How come you aren't doing anything?"  
"你怎么什么都不做？"

Shinji didn't reply, and he didn't think Asuka wanted the answer truthfully. It would only hurt her. But as Asuka leaned in to kiss him again, Shinji turned his head to the side, looking away from her. The smile dropped from Asuka's face after he did this.  
真嗣没有回答，他也不认为明日香真的想知道真相。那只会伤害她。但当明日香再次倾身想要吻他时，真嗣却别过头去，避开了她的目光。他这么做后，明日香脸上的笑容消失了。

"Shinji...kiss me." "真嗣...吻我。"

"...No." "...不。"

"...Please..." "...求你了..."

Shinji returned his eyes to her, and spoke softly, "Asuka, could you get off me?"  
真嗣将目光转回她身上，轻声说道：“明日香，你能从我身上下来吗？”

"...I won't." "...我不会的。"

"Asuka, I don't want this. Not now."  
"明日香，我不想要这个。现在不行。"

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

It took all of Shinji's willpower to not angrily retort to her question, but he wasn't sure how to even react to her next question.  
真嗣用尽所有意志力才忍住不对她的问题愤怒反驳，但他不确定该如何回应她的下一个问题。

"It's because I've been drinking, isn't it?"  
“是因为我喝了酒，对吧？”

Shinji continued looking at her sad expression. He didn't know what he could do for her if she insisted on behaving like this. Slowly, he felt his heart begin to harden slightly.  
真嗣继续注视着她悲伤的表情。如果她坚持这样表现，他不知道自己能为她做些什么。慢慢地，他感到自己的心开始变得有些坚硬。

"...It's true, isn't it?" said Asuka her voice steadily growing in volume.  
"...这是真的，对吧？" 明日香的声音逐渐提高。

Eventually, Shinji only muttered one word.  
最终，真嗣只低声说了一个词。

"...Yes." "...是的。"

At that, Asuka lost control of herself.  
听到这话，明日香失控了。

"Why the fuck do you think I've been doing this!?" she shouted. "Don't you understand how I feel, what I want!?"  
“你他妈以为我为什么要这么做！？”她大声喊道，“你难道不明白我的感受，我想要什么吗！？”

Shinji just let her words assault him. Whatever her reason, he wasn't going to accept it. But next, Asuka did something completely unexpected. Forcibly grabbing Shinji's hand, she placed it at the center of her chest, directly between her breasts. Shinji was taken aback by her action, and tried ignoring his hand brushing against her breasts. This was difficult, but somehow, Shinji managed to ignore the feeling.  
真嗣任由她的话语冲击着自己。无论她的理由是什么，他都不打算接受。但接下来，明日香做了一件完全出乎意料的事。她强行抓住真嗣的手，放在自己胸部的正中央，直接夹在双峰之间。真嗣被她的举动吓了一跳，试图忽略自己的手触碰到她胸部的感觉。这很难，但不知怎的，真嗣还是设法忽视了那种感觉。

"Don't you get it!?" she yelled at him. "Why won't you just do something!?"  
"你还不明白吗！？" 她对他吼道。"你为什么就是不做点什么！？"

"I'm not going to do anything to you while you're drunk Asuka," said Shinji, the anger in his voice growing. "Or have you considered how I feel?"  
"我不会在你喝醉的时候对你做什么的，绫波，" 真嗣说道，他的声音中的怒气越来越盛。"或者你有没有考虑过我的感受？"

Asuka blinked once. Her mind was hazy, and she had drunken far more alcohol than she probably should have, but what's done is done.  
绫波眨了一下眼。她的思绪模糊不清，她喝的酒远远超过了她可能应该喝的量，但事已至此。

"Asuka, how do you think I feel whenever you're drunk, and I have to carry you upstairs? How do you think I feel when you're so drunk you don't even register that we are kissing? Do you honestly think I'd be happing to have you while you're drunk? Or do you want both of us to be so drunk we can't remember anything, and that in our minds, nothing ever happened, because we can't fucking remember anything!? I will not touch you like this Asuka!"  
“明日香，你以为每次你喝醉了，我都得把你扛上楼，我会是什么感觉？你以为当你醉到连我们在接吻都察觉不到时，我会是什么感觉？你真的以为我会愿意在你喝醉时碰你吗？还是你希望我们俩都醉到什么都不记得，然后在我们心里，什么都没发生过，因为我们他妈的什么都不记得了！？我不会这样碰你的，明日香！”

Wrenching his arm free from her grasp, Shinji pushed her off him, and then stood up, leaving Asuka sprawled on the couch. Throwing open the sliding glass door, he opened it with such force that it bounced backwards. Asuka felt dizzy from the sudden shift in her position, but she quickly stood up. She instinctively knew she had done something she shouldn't have. She tried shouting for Shinji, but he was already walking across the yard and down towards the tree line behind their house. She was even halfway towards putting on her shoes, and running out towards him, but that was when she saw something rather unexpected erupting into the sky.  
真嗣猛地挣脱她的手，将她推开，然后站起身来，留下明日香瘫倒在沙发上。他用力拉开滑动玻璃门，门反弹回来。明日香因突然的变动感到头晕，但她很快站了起来。她本能地知道自己做了不该做的事。她试图呼喊真嗣，但他已经穿过院子，走向房子后面的树丛。她甚至已经穿上一半鞋子，准备跑出去追他，但就在这时，她看到了天空中突然爆发的意外景象。

A flash of orange streaked across the sky, signifying that Shinji had used his AT-field in anger, something which he hadn't done in a long time. Asuka stood frozen as she saw this, unable to move. She hadn't seen his AT-field in a long time, which just showed how angry Shinji was at the moment. But even though she was still frozen, and unable to move, she continued yelling after him.  
一道橙色光芒划过天际，预示着真嗣愤怒地使用了 AT 力场，这是他许久未曾有过的举动。明日香呆立原地，动弹不得。她已经很久没有见过他的 AT 力场了，这足以说明真嗣此刻的愤怒程度。尽管她依旧僵硬，无法动弹，却仍对着他大喊大叫。

"Shinji! Please! I'm sorry! I need you! I want you! I...I...I..."  
“真嗣！求你了！对不起！我需要你！我想要你！我...我...我...”

For all Asuka's shouting and pleading, she never got a response, even though her voice echoed around the house, and surely reached the tree line which Shinji disappeared into.  
尽管明日香声嘶力竭地呼喊和恳求，却始终没有得到回应，尽管她的声音在屋内回荡，想必也传到了真嗣消失的那片树丛边缘。

---

Shinji hadn't felt this in a long time, and had assumed that it had passed. Back in Tokyo-2, he had been barely able to control it, but he had changed since then, at least he thought he had.  
真嗣已经很久没有这种感觉了，他曾以为这种感觉已经过去。在东京-2 时，他几乎无法控制它，但自那以后他觉得自己已经改变了。

Stamping through the path that led to the field behind their house, Shinji bitterly started striking objects out of the way within his field of view, using his AT-field. He had to calm down, but the more he thought about it, the more frustrated he got. He didn't care what Asuka's reasons were, or how many times she said she was sorry. He wouldn't cross that boundary, especially if she was drunk.  
真嗣踏着通往家后田间小径，苦涩地开始用他的 AT 力场击打视线内的物体。他必须冷静下来，但越是这么想，他就越感到沮丧。他不在乎明日香的理由，也不在乎她说了多少次对不起。他不会越过那条界限，尤其是如果她喝醉了的话。

He needed to calm himself, but using his AT-field was doing the opposite of this. Making a conscious decision to suppress that part of himself, something he hadn't needed to do in a long while, he paused in the middle of the path, and took a deep breath. Shutting out everything else, he focused on the sounds around him, tuning his mind to only focus on the nature around him. Slowly, he began to calm himself. Even so, he was in mood to return to the house.  
他需要让自己冷静下来，但使用 AT 力场却适得其反。他下意识地决定压抑自己的这一部分，这是他很久没有必要做的事情了。他在小径中间停下，深吸一口气。屏蔽掉其他一切，他专注于周围的声音，让自己的思绪只集中在自然环境上。慢慢地，他开始平静下来。即便如此，他也没有心情回到屋里。

With his anger calmed, he continued walking on the path ahead of him, until he broke through the tree line, and into the open field. The grass was kept low, thanks to his AT-field, and Shinji sprawled out on the grass, stretching himself out as he looked up at the sky.  
怒气平息后，他继续沿着前方的道路前行，直到穿过树丛，步入开阔的田野。得益于他的 AT 力场，草地保持得很低矮，真嗣伸展四肢躺在草地上，仰望着天空。

He wasn't wrong, this much he believed, but he still felt a slight pang in his heart when he thought about it. More than a full year had passed since he had first kissed Asuka, fully awakening his desires towards her. He loved her, and wanted to experience every pleasurable thing with her, but not while she was drunk. But was this just him acting afraid? Asuka wasn't simply hinting at it anymore, but was practically throwing herself at him, wanting him to embrace her fully. Was Shinji's will so weak that he couldn't just accept her, even if she was drunk? Was he naive in thinking that the first time should be special? How would somebody else react in this situation?  
他并不认为自己错了，这一点他深信不疑，但每当想起这件事，心中仍会隐隐作痛。自从第一次亲吻明日香，完全唤醒了他对她的渴望以来，已经过去了一年多的时间。他爱她，想要与她体验所有愉悦的事物，但不是在她醉酒的时候。但这只是他在害怕吗？明日香不再只是暗示，而是几乎在向他投怀送抱，希望他能完全接纳她。真嗣的意志真的如此薄弱，以至于即使她喝醉了，他也无法接受她吗？他认为第一次应该是特别的，这是否太天真了？在这种情况下，别人会如何反应呢？

Never before did Shinji realize how much life experience he lacked, and for the first time in his life, wished that he had an adult to communicate these thoughts to. Such a thing wasn't going to happen, so he only had his own thoughts, and feelings on the subject. Ultimately, it came down to what Shinji wanted, disregarding Asuka for the moment. Both of them had to be in mutual agreement on the subject, otherwise it was pointless. As he was currently though, he couldn't agree to it, and he didn't think this would change. Maybe he was being stubborn, or maybe he just didn't want to hurt Asuka by accident.  
真嗣从未如此深刻地意识到自己生活经验的匮乏，生平第一次，他渴望有个成年人能倾诉这些思绪。然而这不过是奢望，他只能依靠自己的想法和感受来面对这个问题。归根结底，这取决于真嗣自己的意愿，暂且抛开明日香不谈。两人必须在这件事上达成共识，否则一切都是徒劳。就目前而言，他无法同意，也不认为这种情况会改变。或许他只是在固执己见，又或许他只是不想无意中伤害到明日香。

Shinji continued laying there, his mind wavering from one subject to the next, though always returning to Asuka. Time passed slowly for him, but his mind continued working in the background. He didn't know how long he continued laying there, his eyes glazed over while he stared at the sky, but he started realizing that he was growing hungry. Lunch had already come and gone, and it had been several hours since breakfast. He still didn't want to go back up to the house, but he was starting to grow restless just staying here. Even though it probably wasn't something he should do right now, he did briefly think about practicing with his AT-field, even though he had hit a brick wall recently.  
真嗣继续躺在那里，思绪从一个话题飘到另一个话题，但总是回到明日香身上。对他来说，时间过得很慢，但他的大脑仍在后台运转。他不知道自己躺了多久，双眼呆滞地凝视着天空，但他开始意识到自己饿了。午餐已经过去，距离早餐也已过了几个小时。他仍然不想回到屋里，但只是呆在这里让他开始感到不安。尽管现在可能不是他应该做的事情，但他确实短暂地考虑过练习 AT 力场，尽管他最近遇到了瓶颈。

Whether this was the wrong, or correct decision, Shinji never got the chance to make it. He distinctly heard the snapping of a twig behind him, and his body spun around, thinking that a wild animal might have stumbled across him. To his surprise, he saw a figure walking towards him, their hair blowing in the wind as a breeze passed by them.  
无论这是对还是错的决定，真嗣都没有机会做出选择。他清楚地听到身后树枝断裂的声音，身体迅速转身，以为可能是野生动物偶然发现了他。令他惊讶的是，他看到一个人影向他走来，他们的头发在微风中飘动。

"...Asuka?" Shinji wondered, not expecting her here in the slightest, especially after everything that had happened. He honestly wasn't sure whether he could talk with her right now, as their argument came back to him, and he found himself frowning slightly.  
"...明日香？" 真嗣疑惑地想，完全没想到会在这里见到她，尤其是在发生了那么多事情之后。他真的不确定现在是否能和她交谈，因为他们的争吵又浮现在脑海中，他发现自己微微皱起了眉头。

Asuka didn't reply to him though, and continued walking towards him. She wasn't looking at him, her eyes staring across the field, while her hands were clasped behind her back. She was wearing vivid navy jeans, and sporting a white t-shirt with an emblem splash across the front.  
然而，明日香并没有回答他，继续向他走来。她没有看他，目光凝视着远处的田野，双手交叉在背后。她穿着鲜艳的海军蓝牛仔裤，身上是一件白色 T 恤，胸前印着醒目的徽章图案。

Asuka walked by him, without giving him a single glance, and stood several paces away from where Shinji was still sitting. Shinji stared at her back, wondering what she was doing. At least she didn't seem to have continued drinking.  
明日香从他身边走过，一眼都没看他，站在离真嗣仍坐着的地方几步远的地方。真嗣盯着她的背影，想知道她在做什么。至少她看起来没有继续喝酒。

"You know, sometimes I forget how much you care about me," said Asuka suddenly.  
"你知道吗，有时候我会忘记你有多在乎我，" 明日香突然说道。

Shinji didn't reply, but continued watching her. Asuka had something on her mind, which seemed clear by her demeanor. Shinji wasn't sure whether he wanted to listen to her right now however, no matter what she had to say.  
真嗣没有回答，只是继续看着她。明日香心里似乎有事，从她的举止中可以明显看出。真嗣不确定自己现在是否想听她说话，不管她要说什么。

"I don't blame you for earlier. I recognize that it was wrong how I acted in that situation, but at the same time, I felt like I had hit a brick wall, and couldn't overcome up."  
"我不会怪你之前的反应。我承认自己在那种情况下的行为是错误的，但与此同时，我感觉自己像是撞上了一堵墙，无法逾越。"

Shinji frowned at her, not understanding what she was talking about. He understood that alcohol was used in an attempt to overcome whatever road block she had run into, but even so, he couldn't agree with this. If she had just talked to him instead, then maybe things would have been different.  
真嗣皱眉看着她，不明白她在说什么。他知道她试图用酒精来克服遇到的障碍，但即便如此，他也不能赞同这种做法。如果她当时选择和他谈谈，也许情况会有所不同。

"Hey Shinji?" said Asuka as she turned her head to look at him. "Have you ever wanted something so desperately, that you would do anything to obtain it, even if it could possibly hurt yourself, or the person beside you?"  
“嘿，真嗣？”明日香转过头来看着他，问道，“你有没有那么渴望过某样东西，以至于愿意不惜一切代价去得到它，哪怕这可能会伤害到你自己，或是你身边的人？”

Shinji had never owned many worldly possessions due to his constant moving, so he had never cared for physical objects very much. But this of course didn't just refer to worldly objects either.  
由于经常搬家，真嗣从未拥有过多少物质财富，所以他并不太在意物质的东西。当然，这不仅仅是指物质上的东西。

"No, I don't think so. Besides, if it could hurt somebody I truly care about, then I don't think it would be worth it."  
“不，我不这么认为。再说了，如果它会伤害到我真正在乎的人，那么我认为它就不值得。”

"Maybe thats where we're different then," said Asuka with a sad smile, glad that Shinji had at least responded to her. "I don't know if it's because of my upbringing, or my own desperation, but I've never felt such a strong desire before. I only cared about myself, and in doing so made a mistake. I regret it, but even now, that desire is still strong, if not stronger."  
“也许这就是我们的不同之处吧，”明日香带着悲伤的微笑说道，庆幸真嗣至少回应了她。“我不知道这是因为我成长的方式，还是我自己的绝望，但我从未有过如此强烈的渴望。我只关心自己，这样做犯了个错误。我后悔了，但即便现在，那种渴望依然强烈，甚至更甚。”

Shinji realized that they were dancing around the larger question, even though both knew what it was. It was unspoken between them, but Asuka had nearly spoken the truth earlier when she had demanded him to kiss her. The thin line between them had shrunken so far that the thought was always on their mind, but this was the closest they had come to speaking freely about it.  
真嗣意识到他们一直在回避那个更大的问题，尽管双方都心知肚明。这个问题在他们之间未曾明说，但明日香之前几乎说出了真相，当她要求他吻她时。他们之间的那条细线已经缩得如此之短，以至于这个念头始终萦绕在他们心头，但这是他们最接近自由谈论它的时刻。

"I know I screwed up earlier, but that doesn't mean I wont continue chasing after what I want."  
"我知道我之前搞砸了，但这并不意味着我会停止追逐我想要的东西。"

"...Does that mean you'll continue drinking?" asked Shinji after a pause.  
"...那意味着你会继续喝酒吗？" 真嗣停顿了一下问道。"

"...I don't want to, and I don't enjoy it, but it also helped to ignore everything for a while."  
"...我不想喝，也不喜欢，但它也确实帮助我暂时忽略了所有事情。"

"Why would you need to do that though, that's what I don't understand?" asked Shinji suddenly, his voice slightly growing in volume. "Why wouldn't you just try talking to me about it? Back when I first starting realizing the changes I was going through, you were always there beside me, reassuring me that everything was fine, and that I was me. Asuka, if you hadn't helped me through those weeks, I think things would be vastly different right now. So why didn't you just try talking to-"  
"可你为什么要这么做呢，我就是不明白这一点？" 真嗣突然问道，声音微微提高。"为什么不直接跟我谈谈呢？当我最初开始意识到自己正在经历的变化时，你总是在我身边，安慰我一切都会好，我还是我。明日香，如果没有你那几周的帮助，我想现在的情况会大不相同。所以你为什么不试着跟我谈谈呢？"

"Don't you understand how difficult and embarrassing that is!?" shouted Asuka suddenly. "And why do I have to say anything. You're a guy, so show some backbone for once damn it!"  
"你难道不明白那有多难堪吗！？" 明日香突然喊道。"而且我为什么要说什么。你是男生，就不能硬气一次吗，该死的！"

Shinji flinched slightly at her words. It wasn't like he was deliberately not saying anything, but he felt that it was too soon to begin with, so he had ignored it for now, even if his body didn't want to agree to this. But Asuka had been battling with her mind for a while now, while Shinji was coasting along on the given path.  
真嗣听到她的话微微一颤。他并非有意不说话，只是觉得时机未到，所以暂时忽略了，尽管他的身体并不愿意同意这一点。但明日香已经与自己的内心斗争了一段时间，而真嗣则一直沿着既定的道路前行。

"Asuka...I...well-" "明日香...我...嗯-"

"And don't tell me it hasn't crossed your mind. I'm not stupid."  
"别告诉我你没想过。我又不是傻子。"

Shinji bit back a certain retort that referred to Asuka's late night journey's downstairs, but that would do the opposite of improving the situation.  
真嗣忍住了提到明日香深夜下楼的某些反驳，但那样只会让情况变得更糟。

"So...what do you-" started Shinji slowly, before being cut off by Asuka.  
"那么...你想说什么-" 真嗣缓缓开口，却被明日香打断了。

"Like I said, I won't stopping chasing after what I want."  
"就像我说的，我不会停止追求我想要的东西。"

Asuka was dead set in her determination, something which Shinji still lacked. Scratching the back of his head, he nervously looked away from Asuka, trying to focus his mind elsewhere. Well, in the meantime though, Shinji felt that it might be best to continue this back at the house. He still wasn't sure, and neither had he said everything on the subject, especially with regards to Asuka's drinking.  
明日香坚定不移，而真嗣仍缺乏这种决心。他挠了挠后脑勺，紧张地避开明日香的目光，试图将注意力转移到别处。尽管如此，真嗣觉得最好还是回家后再继续这个话题。他仍不确定，也没有把所有关于明日香喝酒的事情都说出来。

"Asuka, do you mind if we go back to the house and continue this? I didn't eat lunch, so I've been feeling hungry this whole time."  
“明日香，我们回屋继续好吗？我午饭没吃，一直觉得饿。”

"...I don't," mumbled Asuka. She had said what she wanted more or less, so the only thing she could do now was wait for Shinji. She tried suppressing her desires, but she didn't think she could lie any further. She had pushed those thoughts away for so long, that she was ready to finally face them.  
“……我不介意。”明日香咕哝着。她已经差不多说出了自己想要的，现在唯一能做的就是等待真嗣。她试图压抑自己的欲望，但她觉得无法再撒谎了。她已经把这些念头推开太久，现在终于准备好面对它们了。

They walked back to the house slowly, Shinji walking in front, and Asuka behind him. Asuka had her eyes glued to his back, watching his every movement. Her imagination began to run wild and to her embarrassment, she felt her arousal growing. Her body starting tightening up as her mind continued created images, and her heart started beating wildly. Just by being this close to Shinji was making her feeling like this, and when he turned around to look at her, Asuka couldn't hide the blush that spread across her face.  
他们慢慢走回家，真嗣走在前面，明日香跟在后面。明日香的眼睛紧盯着他的背影，观察着他的一举一动。她的想象力开始狂奔，让她尴尬的是，她感到自己的欲望在增长。她的身体开始紧绷，脑海中不断浮现出画面，心跳也加速起来。仅仅是因为靠近真嗣就让她有这样的感觉，当他转过身来看她时，明日香无法掩饰脸上蔓延的红晕。

"You okay Asuka?" "你还好吗，明日香？"

"Y-Yeah, I'm fine," said Asuka in what she hoped was a stable voice. She didn't know how much more she could take of this.  
"嗯，我没事，" 明日香尽量用平稳的声音说道。她不知道自己还能承受多少这样的压力。

Shinji gave her a strange look, but shrugged off her strange reaction. He was feeling slightly strange himself, and things probably would have been different if Asuka was in front of him.  
真嗣给了她一个奇怪的眼神，但还是忽略了她的异常反应。他自己也感到有些奇怪，如果明日香在他面前，情况可能会有所不同。

By the time they reached their house, Asuka was freely panting from her exhaustion. She had afterall walked all the way down to the field, and then walked back after a short time later. While Asuka collapsed on the couch, Shinji made himself something quick to eat. He asked whether she wanted anything, but she just waved her hand from where she was laying.  
当他们到家时，明日香已经因为疲惫而大口喘气。毕竟她一路走到田野，又没过多久就走回来了。明日香瘫倒在沙发上，而真嗣则迅速给自己弄了点吃的。他问她是否需要什么，但她只是躺在那里挥了挥手。

When he was finished cooking, Shinji sat in the chair beside the couch, to which Asuka was glad for. If Shinji sat beside her just now, she would have knocked his plate out of his hands and kissed him. She was still aroused, and this didn't seem to be changing anytime soon. It wasn't just her exhaustion that was making her sweat, but her desire to have Shinji kiss her, among other things. She was really reaching her limit.  
真嗣煮完饭后，坐在沙发旁的椅子上，这让明日香感到欣慰。如果真嗣现在坐在她旁边，她可能会打翻他的盘子并吻他。她仍然感到兴奋，而且这种情况似乎不会很快改变。不仅仅是疲惫让她出汗，还有她对真嗣吻她以及其他事情的渴望。她真的快到极限了。

Finishing his makeshift meal, Shinji dumped his plate in the sink, and let out a low sigh. He was still nervous about what to do with Asuka. It wasn't like he didn't want that, but he felt it was happening all too quickly. Maybe if things progressed a little more then...but he was aware of how much he wanted it, so maybe it wasn't such a bad thing afterall.  
吃完临时准备的饭菜后，真嗣把盘子扔进水槽，低声叹了口气。他仍然对如何处理与明日香的关系感到紧张。并不是说他不想要那样，只是他觉得这一切发生得太快了。也许如果事情再发展一点...但他也意识到自己有多么渴望，所以也许这并不是什么坏事。

Turning around to speak to her, Shinji came face to face with Asuka who had sneaked away from the couch and stood directly behind him. Her face was flushed red, and she was biting her lips slightly, but Shinji saw a glimmer in her eyes which he hadn't seen in a while.  
转过身来与她说话，真嗣迎面碰上了从沙发上悄悄溜走并直接站在他身后的明日香。她的脸颊泛红，微微咬着嘴唇，但真嗣在她眼中看到了久违的光芒。

"Sorry if I'm going about this the wrong way, but I really don't care anymore."  
“如果我这样做不对，抱歉，但我真的不在乎了。”

Without any further words, Asuka brought her face parallel with Shinji's, and pressed her lips against his. Though she said she didn't care anymore, Shinji could still feel the nervousness and tension within her kiss. It was something he hadn't felt from her in a while, and Shinji assumed it must be because she wasn't sure whether he'd respond in turn. It had been a long time since Shinji had felt Asuka's lips without the taste of alcohol on her breath, so he let himself fall into the familiar motions.  
没有再多说什么，明日香将自己的脸贴近真嗣的，轻轻地吻上了他的唇。尽管她说自己不再在乎，真嗣仍能感受到她吻中的紧张与不安。这是他许久未从她那里感受到的，真嗣猜想这或许是因为她不确定他是否会回应。自从上次感受到明日香唇间的气息未带酒味已过去很久，于是他让自己沉浸在这熟悉的动作中。

Cupping Asuka's face, he kissed her back slowly, letting his feelings for her transmit through the kiss. He had truly missed this, and whatever worries he was having earlier, were quickly melting away. This just felt somehow right to him. He felt himself smiling slightly while they kissed, and quickly tried to correct this, but Asuka didn't seem to mind, and even starting smiling herself. As Shinji noticed this though, he also saw that tears were silently leaking from her eyes. This shocked him immensely, and he couldn't help but pause and ask if she was alright.  
他双手捧起明日香的脸颊，缓缓回吻她，让对她的情感通过这个吻传递。他真的非常想念这一刻，之前所有的忧虑都迅速消融。这感觉对他来说，不知为何如此正确。他在亲吻中不禁微微一笑，随即试图纠正，但明日香似乎并不介意，甚至也开始微笑。然而，当真嗣注意到这一点时，他也看到泪水正无声地从她的眼中滑落。这让他大为震惊，忍不住停下询问她是否还好。

"Asuka, what's wrong?" “明日香，怎么了？”

"Nothing...I'm just happy," she replied with a radiant smile, ignoring the tears of happiness which were uncontrollably streaming down her cheeks. Shinji stared at her within arms length, and then slowly drew closer to her, kissing her softly against her cheek, his lips brushing against the salty tears. Asuka continued silently crying, as her body began to feel warm and her heart elated.  
“没什么……我只是很高兴，”她带着灿烂的笑容回答，无视那些无法控制、顺着脸颊流淌的幸福泪水。真嗣在咫尺之间凝视着她，然后慢慢靠近，轻吻她的脸颊，唇瓣轻触着咸涩的泪珠。明日香继续默默流泪，身体感到温暖，内心充满喜悦。

Shinji pressed his lips against hers again, this time kissing her more deeply as his tongue found hers, and they became entwined with one another. Shinji quickly found his brain begin to shut off as they kissed, while his desires began to take over. Their bodies were now firmly pressed against each other as they stood in the middle of the kitchen. Shinji felt a reaction pressing against his pants, and didn't mind it in the slightest. Towards the woman he loved, this was normal, and more so when she wasn't drunk.  
真嗣再次将唇贴上她的，这一次吻得更深，他的舌头找到了她的，彼此缠绵。随着亲吻，真嗣很快感到自己的理智开始关闭，欲望开始占据上风。他们的身体现在紧紧地贴在一起，站在厨房中央。真嗣感觉到裤子里的反应，对此毫不在意。对于他爱的女人，这是正常的，尤其是当她没有喝醉的时候。

Shinji quickly had to suppress himself though, when Asuka began pressing her body more firmly against his. She obviously knew that he was aroused, and could feel his groin pressing against her, but she didn't shy away from this sensation. She had come to accept this, and even wanted it. Her warm body pressed against his, creating friction, and Shinji was quickly losing control of the thing between his legs. He had never felt like this until today, but he tried holding himself back.  
然而，当明日香开始更紧地贴住他的身体时，真嗣迅速压制住自己。她显然知道他兴奋了，能感觉到他的下体紧贴着她，但她并没有因此退缩。她已经接受了这种感觉，甚至渴望它。她温暖的身躯紧贴着他，产生摩擦，真嗣很快失去了对双腿间那物的控制。他从未有过今天这样的感觉，但他试图克制自己。

Asuka suddenly stopped however, and drew back from him. Shinji had complicated feelings with regards to this, but was unsure whether he wanted her to continue or not. Anymore would have been dangerous. Asuka still hadn't finished though, because she took his hand and whispered directly into his ear-  
然而，明日香突然停了下来，从他身边退开。真嗣对此心情复杂，不确定是否希望她继续。再进一步可能会很危险。但明日香还没说完，因为她握住他的手，直接对着他的耳朵低语——

"Lets continue this on the couch since it'll be more comfortable."  
“我们到沙发上继续吧，那里会更舒服。”

She breathed softly against his ear after she said this, and Shinji felt a pleasant shiver travel up his spine. He didn't even nod, but just placed his hand in Asuka's, letting her steer him towards the couch. Lying down, Asuka pulled Shinji on top of her, their faces inches apart from each other. Shinji pressed his lips against hers, and they continued kissing, but Shinji now wanted to repay Asuka for what she had done earlier.  
她说完后，轻轻对着他的耳朵呼吸，真嗣感到一阵愉悦的颤栗沿着脊椎上升。他甚至没有点头，只是把手放在明日香的手中，任由她引导他走向沙发。躺下后，明日香将真嗣拉到自己身上，两人的脸相距仅几英寸。真嗣将嘴唇贴在她的唇上，他们继续亲吻，但真嗣现在想回报明日香之前所做的一切。

He wished that she was wearing shorts as he did this, but he supposed there would be opportunity for that another time. Placing a hand on her leg, he slowly trailed his hand up, before circling around to her inner thigh. As he had started this, Asuka's interpretation of what he was going to do played out in her head, and her body shuddered pleasantly, the spot between her legs quickly growing moist. When Shinji's hand moved to her inner thigh, Asuka realized her erotic thought had been wrong, but Shinji did something instead which was pleasant for Asuka.  
他希望她此刻能像他一样穿着短裤，但他猜想下次总会有机会的。他将手轻轻搭在她的腿上，缓缓向上游移，随后绕至她的大腿内侧。就在他开始这一动作时，明日香脑海中浮现出对他的意图的解读，她的身体不由自主地颤抖起来，愉悦感油然而生，双腿间迅速变得湿润。当真嗣的手移向她的大腿内侧时，明日香意识到自己的色情幻想错了，但真嗣接下来的举动却让她感到愉悦。

He began rubbing her thigh slowly, still wishing that she wasn't wearing pants, but the effect seemed to make Asuka react. She moaned softly, her voice leaking out while they continued to kiss passionately. Next, Shinji slowly moved his hand up towards her hips, and then surprising Asuka, placed his hand against her butt, grasping her slightly. Asuka was so surprised, that for one moment, she even stopped kissing Shinji, but his hand didn't remain at her butt for long, and quickly snaked its way up her back, touching her smooth skin. Asuka's body started shivering uncontrollably as waves of pleasure assaulted her, the wetness between her legs becoming even more pronounced.  
他开始缓缓地揉搓她的大腿，心中仍希望她没有穿裤子，但这一举动似乎让明日香有了反应。她轻轻地呻吟着，声音在两人继续热情拥吻时悄然泄出。接着，真嗣慢慢地将手移向她的臀部，然后出乎明日香意料地，将手放在她的臀部上，轻轻握住。明日香如此惊讶，以至于有那么一刻，她甚至停止了与真嗣的亲吻，但他的手并没有在她的臀部停留太久，很快便沿着她的背部向上游走，触碰到她光滑的肌肤。明日香的身体开始不由自主地颤抖，一波波快感袭来，她双腿间的湿润变得更加明显。

This is what she had wanted, what she had always wanted in the far reaches of her heart. Finally, she felt the emptiness within her being filled. If things continued as they were, then eventually, Asuka would willingly give her entirety to Shinji.  
这正是她所渴望的，她内心深处一直渴望的。终于，她感到内心的空虚被填满了。如果事情继续这样发展下去，那么最终，明日香会心甘情愿地将全部交给真嗣。

Shinji still wasn't set on this course however. Separating his lips from hers, Shinji sat up, positioning himself beside Asuka so that he was no longer crushing her with his weight. Asuka wasn't pleased with his though, and gave a low sigh while she looked at him.  
然而，真嗣仍未下定决心走上这条路。他将自己的嘴唇从她的唇上移开，坐起身来，调整自己的位置，不再用体重压着明日香。明日香对此并不满意，她看着他，发出了一声低沉的叹息。

"Is something wrong?" she asked.  
"有什么不对劲吗？" 她问道。

"...Sorry, I'm just having difficulty coping right now."  
"...抱歉，我现在只是有点难以应对。"

'Why do you have to make things so complicated?' wondered Asuka. 'Isn't it enough to just accept it?'  
“为什么你非要把事情弄得这么复杂？”明日香疑惑道，“简单接受不就好了吗？”

Sitting up, Asuka leaned against him, her eyes locking onto his chest, and then turning down towards his waist. She didn't want to stop, but Shinji seemed distracted right now. She wanted to press her body against his bare chest like in the past, but even that wasn't enough. Though she was unsure about it right now, she was curious about the thing between his legs. She had felt it pressing against her many times before, even with the separation of their clothes, but this was the first time she gave it serious thought. In the past, these thoughts might have repulsed her, but now, they turned her on.  
坐起身来，明日香靠向他，目光锁定在他的胸膛，随后向下移至腰间。她不想停下，但真嗣此刻似乎心不在焉。她渴望像过去那样将身体紧贴他赤裸的胸膛，但即便如此也不够。尽管此刻她对此感到不确定，但她对那两腿间的事物产生了好奇。她曾多次感受到它隔着衣物抵着自己，但这是她第一次认真思考。以往这些念头或许会让她反感，如今却让她兴奋不已。

Like Asuka said in the past, she wasn't going to stop chasing after what she wanted. Pressing her warm body against Shinji again, she felt him shudder slightly as her breasts pressed into his side. He was focusing on something else at the moment, but she saw his eyes flicker over to her briefly. She wanted to know what he was thinking right now, even if his thoughts were erotic. Asuka gave him a seductive smile, but Shinji very pointedly looked away from her. Asuka's smile turned into a smirk, at least glad that she was getting a reaction from Shinji now. Looking down at his pants, she noticed that there was still a significant bulge there. She began staring it at, though quickly looked away when Shinji's eyes flickered back to her, her face briefly turning red.  
正如明日香过去所说，她不会停止追逐自己想要的东西。她再次将温暖的身躯紧贴着真嗣，感觉到他微微颤抖，她的胸部紧贴在他的侧边。他此刻正专注于其他事情，但她瞥见他的目光短暂地扫过她。她想知道他现在在想什么，即使他的思绪是色情的。明日香给了他一个诱惑的微笑，但真嗣却故意移开了视线。明日香的微笑变成了得意的笑，至少她现在能从真嗣那里得到反应了。她低头看着他的裤子，注意到那里仍然有一个明显的隆起。她开始盯着它看，但当真嗣的目光再次扫过她时，她迅速移开了视线，脸上短暂地泛起了红晕。

'Whatever,' thought Asuka. Standing up, she stretched, letting out a small yawn in the process. After walking down to the field in back, coupled with her lack of sleep, she was feeling tired.  
“随便吧，”明日香心想。她站起身，伸了个懒腰，同时打了个小哈欠。从后院走到田野，再加上缺乏睡眠，她感到疲惫。

"I think I'm going to sleep for a few hours. Wake me up around dinner if you will."  
“我想我要睡几个小时。晚饭时叫醒我，如果你愿意的话。”

"Right," said Shinji, his voice strained slightly.  
“好，”真嗣说道，声音略显紧张。

Shinji didn't look around the house again until after Asuka had gone upstairs, though in all honesty, he wished he could have gone upstairs before her. Simply put, he needed to change his underwear. He hadn't stopped kissing Asuka because he didn't want to continue, but because he was overly aware of his groin pressing against his pants, and the wetness that had quickly spread. Shinji wasn't sure whether he felt disgusted, or relieved in a certain sense.  
直到明日香上楼后，真嗣才再次环顾屋内，尽管说实话，他真希望自己能比她先上楼。简而言之，他需要换条内裤。他停止亲吻明日香并非不想继续，而是因为他过于意识到自己的下体紧贴着裤子，以及迅速蔓延的湿润感。真嗣不确定自己是感到厌恶，还是在某种程度上感到释然。

Letting out a heavy sigh, he tried to distract himself for a while, at least until dinner.  
他重重地叹了口气，试图分散自己的注意力，至少到晚餐时间。

---

Shinji found cooking to be far more difficult to focus on than he initially thought. He had fine tuned his methods over the long course of his time working on a campfire, or makeshift stove, but with Asuka's face constantly in his mind, he found it nearly impossible to work.  
真嗣发现烹饪比他最初想象的要难集中注意力得多。他在长时间使用篝火或临时炉灶的过程中已经精心调整了自己的方法，但由于明日香的面容不断浮现在脑海中，他发现自己几乎无法工作。

After burning the canned food for the third time in a row, Shinji sank into the wicker chair, and buried his face in his hands. He couldn't get Asuka's face out of his mind, and more importantly, her body. He wanted to feel her smooth skin as his hands explored every inch of her body. He didn't want to deal with her clothes preventing him from doing this.  
连续第三次烧焦罐头食品后，真嗣瘫坐在柳条椅上，双手掩面。他无法将明日香的面容从脑海中抹去，更重要的是，她的身体。他渴望感受她光滑的肌肤，双手探索她身体的每一寸。他不希望她的衣物妨碍他这样做。

Shinji had been battling with his arousal constantly through the afternoon ever since Asuka had gone upstairs, and even considered relieving it himself, but had held himself back. The more he thought about her though, the more uncomfortable he became.  
自从明日香上楼后，真嗣整个下午都在与自己的兴奋感作斗争，甚至考虑过自行解决，但最终还是克制住了。然而，他越是想她，就越感到不适。

"Why does it smell like burning cardboard out here?" came a voice behind him.  
“为什么这里闻起来像烧纸板？”他身后传来一个声音。

Spinning around, Shinji saw that Asuka had opened the sliding glass door and stepped outside, though because of his distraction, he hadn't noticed.  
真嗣转过身，看到明日香打开了滑动玻璃门走了出来，但由于他的分心，他并没有注意到。

"Do you really need to ask that?" said Shinji with a grumble.  
“你真的需要问这个吗？”真嗣咕哝着说。

"Well, it's good to know you're human I suppose. This is my first time I've seen you actually mess up while cooking. What happened?"  
"嗯，知道你也是人我就放心了。这是我第一次见你在做饭时出错。怎么了？"

'I couldn't stop thinking of you, and ended up burning the food,' thought Shinji, obviously not capable of speaking these thoughts out loud.  
'我满脑子都是你，结果把食物烧焦了，' 真嗣心想，显然他无法将这些想法大声说出来。

"I was distracted," said Shinji simply.  
"我走神了，" 真嗣简单地回答道。

"Hmm?" wondered Asuka with a raised eyebrow, assuming far more from this simple statement then what Shinji had said.  
"嗯？" 明日香挑起眉毛，对这个简单的陈述做出了远超真嗣所言的假设。

"Well, guess I'll take over at least since you seem incapable right now."  
"好吧，看来我至少得接手了，既然你现在似乎无能为力。"

"I thought you were sleeping."  
"我还以为你在睡觉呢。"

"I was, until I got woken up by the smell of charcoaled food."  
"我本来在睡，直到被烧焦食物的气味弄醒。"

"...Sorry," mumbled Shinji.  
"……抱歉，" 真嗣咕哝道。"

"Don't worry about it," said Asuka with a smile. "Consider it my attempt at repaying you for putting up with me these past few months. I know I've been an idiot."  
"别放在心上，" 明日香微笑着说，"就当是我这几个月来忍受我的补偿吧。我知道自己一直很蠢。"

"Asu-"

Asuka placed a finger against his lip, silencing him immediately.  
明日香用手指轻触他的唇，立刻让他安静下来。

"Not another word. Just sit there and let me deal with everything."  
"别再说了。就坐在那儿，让我来处理一切。"

Shinji closed his mouth and did just that, letting Asuka take over the task of preparing dinner. Quickly though, it became clear to Shinji that Asuka had an ulterior motive for cooking dinner. She was making far larger motions that pronounced her body, and seemed to always want her back at Shinji. With this, Shinji was able to see her butt, clearly defined by the tight jeans she was wearing. He was tempted to stand up multiple times and go wait in the living room, though Asuka would occasionally throw glances at him, and Shinji knew that if he tried to stand up, she'd make him sit back down.  
真嗣闭上嘴，照做了，让明日香接手准备晚餐的任务。然而很快，真嗣就意识到明日香做饭另有目的。她的动作幅度很大，刻意凸显自己的身材，而且似乎总是有意无意地把背部朝向真嗣。这样一来，真嗣就能清楚地看到她紧身牛仔裤包裹下的臀部。他好几次都想站起来去客厅等着，但明日香时不时会瞥他一眼，真嗣知道如果他试图站起来，她肯定会让他坐回去。

So, with the pressure in his pants redoubled, Shinji sat in the chair with his eyes glued to Asuka, who couldn't help but occasionally chuckle. She was having fun teasing Shinji in such a way, though she didn't mind cooking either.  
于是，随着裤裆里的压力倍增，真嗣坐在椅子上，眼睛紧盯着明日香，而她忍不住偶尔轻笑出声。她很享受这样逗弄真嗣，不过做饭本身她也不介意。

This continued all the way until Asuka was serving dinner, which they ate outside. The sun was just disappearing behind the horizon, and they had front row seats to this spectacle. Sitting beside each other, they silently ate the dinner the Asuka had finished. Shinji wasn't feeling as uncomfortable as he was earlier, but there was still the occasionally reaction as he glanced at Asuka. She was enjoying herself however, and didn't seem to be worried about much.  
这一直持续到明日香准备晚餐，他们选择在户外用餐。太阳正缓缓沉入地平线，他们有幸坐在这壮观景象的第一排。并肩而坐，他们默默地吃着明日香准备好的晚餐。真嗣不再像之前那样感到不自在，但偶尔还是会有些不自然的反应，当他瞥向明日香时。然而，明日香似乎很享受，看起来并不担心什么。

When they were finished, Shinji took up the task of cleaning everything, since he had made most of the mess while trying to prepare the food, and failing multiple times. While he was doing this, Asuka disappeared back upstairs. Shinji wasn't sure whether she had gone back to sleep, but even if she did, he found this rather odd. Either way, he tried focusing on cleaning the kitchen and grill in the meantime.  
饭后，真嗣承担起清理的任务，毕竟大部分混乱都是他在尝试准备食物时造成的，失败了多次。在他做这些的时候，明日香又回到了楼上。真嗣不确定她是否回去睡觉了，但即便如此，他还是觉得这很奇怪。无论如何，他尽量专注于清理厨房和烤架。

Placing the last of the dishes in the cupboard, he dried his hands off in front of the sink. He'd be lying if he said he wasn't curious about what Asuka was doing right now, so before anything else, he decided to go check on her.  
将最后几个盘子放进橱柜后，他在水槽前擦干了手。如果他说自己对明日香现在在做什么不好奇，那他就是在撒谎，所以在做其他事情之前，他决定去看看她。

Marching up the stairs, he then walked down the long hallway to the bedroom, and was surprised to find it closed. Shinji found this strange, but thought that Asuka may be changing. Knocking on it twice, he got a reply from her, and then entered the bedroom.  
他走上楼梯，穿过长长的走廊来到卧室，惊讶地发现门是关着的。真嗣觉得这很奇怪，但想到明日香可能在换衣服。他敲了两下门，得到了她的回应，然后走进了卧室。

Asuka was laying on the bed, though she was clearly in no mood to go to sleep. Her back was against the headboard, and her legs were drawn up in front of her. There was a book beside her, so Shinji assumed that she might have been reading, but there was something about her expression as he walked in that he couldn't figure out.  
明日香躺在床上，显然没有睡意。她的背靠在床头板上，双腿蜷缩在身前。她旁边有一本书，所以真嗣猜她可能在看书，但当他走进来时，她脸上的表情让他有些不解。

"God, about time you show up. What did you do, clean both the kitchen and living room?"  
“天啊，你终于来了。你做了什么，打扫了厨房和客厅吗？”

Shinji let that slide, and was about to open his mouth when Asuka swung her legs off the bed, and then jumped up the rest of the way, springing her body forward. She darted towards Shinji, wrapped her arms around him, drawing him into a strong hug.  
真嗣没在意这些，正要开口时，明日香却把腿从床上挪开，然后一跃而起，身体向前弹射出去。她冲向真嗣，双臂环抱住他，给了他一个紧紧的拥抱。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji, a bit surprised by this suddenness.  
“明日香？”真嗣有些惊讶于这突如其来的举动。

Asuka didn't reply, her face buried in Shinji's chest. She had been waiting for him this entire time, so she was trying to suppress her sudden desires temporarily. There were so many things she wanted to do right now, but she had to put those on hold for now.  
明日香没有回答，她的脸埋在真嗣的胸前。她一直在等他，所以她试图暂时压抑自己突如其来的冲动。现在她有很多想做的事情，但她必须暂时搁置这些念头。

Breaking apart, Asuka looked up at Shinji, wanting to kiss him. Instead, she asked him for a small favor.  
分崩离析之际，明日香抬头望向真嗣，渴望吻他。然而，她却向他提出了一个小小的请求。

"Hey Shinji, I want you to turn around for a second."  
“嘿，真嗣，我要你转过身去一会儿。”

"...Why?" asked Shinji rather skeptically.  
“……为什么？”真嗣颇为怀疑地问道。

"I won't say. Just turn around."  
"我不会说的。转过身去吧。"

Shinji frowned at her, and for one moment, Asuka thought she may have to forcefully turn him, when he moved his feet, and stared at the door behind him.  
真嗣皱眉看着她，有那么一刻，明日香以为她可能得强行让他转身，但他挪动了脚步，凝视着身后的门。

"Is this alright?" "这样可以吗？"

"...Yeah," said Asuka. "...嗯，" 明日香说道。

Shinji let out a low sigh, wondering what Asuka was doing behind him. Whatever it was, she was being careful, and he couldn't hear anything of importance. There was a very obvious possibility that arose in Shinji's mind, but he pushed that thought away. For Asuka to do something like that, he didn't feel it very plausible.  
真嗣发出一声低沉的叹息，想知道明日香在他背后做什么。无论是什么，她都很小心，他听不到任何重要的声音。真嗣的脑海中浮现出一个非常明显的可能性，但他把那个念头推开了。明日香会做那样的事，他觉得不太可能。

"Okay Shinji...you can turn around."  
"好了，真嗣...你可以转过身来了。"

Shinji did so, without much thought, and when he saw Asuka, immediately felt a reaction from his groin. Asuka was standing there, clad in nothing but her white underwear. This wasn't the first time Shinji had seen her in nothing but underwear, though Asuka was blushing furiously, and her hands were fidgeting in front of her, while her eyes were directed at the floor. Her cleavage was well defined, even though her bra expertly held her breasts in place. Her butt was heavily accented, and her underwear met the definition of cute, with lace at her hips, and a delicate pattern done along the hem. Shinji swallowed every perverted thought he suddenly had...but he wanted her then and there.  
真嗣没有多想就照做了，当他看到明日香时，下体立刻有了反应。明日香站在那里，只穿着她的白色内衣。虽然这不是真嗣第一次看到她只穿内衣的样子，但明日香的脸红得像熟透的苹果，双手不安地摆弄着，眼睛盯着地板。尽管她的胸罩巧妙地托住了胸部，但她的乳沟依然清晰可见。她的臀部线条突出，内裤则是可爱风格，腰部有蕾丝装饰，边缘还有精致的图案。真嗣咽下了所有突然冒出的猥琐念头……但他当时就想要她。

"...Hey...Shinji?" “……嘿……真嗣？”

"...Yes?" “……嗯？”

"...This isn't weird, is it?"  
“……这不会很奇怪吧？”

Shinji paused, and thought long and hard about this question before he answered her.  
真嗣停顿了一下，对这个问题的答案深思熟虑了一番后才回答她。

"No...it's natural. Afterall Asuka, I lo-"  
“不……这是自然的。毕竟，明日香，我……”

Whether Asuka had any sort of inkling towards what Shinji had been about to say, she didn't say, and likely hadn't heard him. At the words 'natural', Asuka was already halfway towards Shinji. Cutting him off, she pressed her lips firmly against his, her near naked body pressing against his.  
明日香是否察觉到真嗣即将说出的话，她没有表露，也可能根本没听到。在听到‘自然’这个词时，明日香已经半途走向真嗣。她打断了他，坚定地吻上了他的唇，近乎赤裸的身体紧贴着他。

Shinji felt all of his neurons fire at once, as nerve impulses traveled along his whole body, creating waves of pleasure that he had never felt before. He kissed Asuka hungrily, wrapping his arms around her, his hands clawing at her back. Asuka arched herself backwards, her hips grinding against Shinji's, feeling a reaction from his groin. She was quickly becoming lost in this, but she wanted to keep her mind clear if she could.  
真嗣感到所有的神经元瞬间被激活，神经冲动沿着全身传播，产生了前所未有的愉悦浪潮。他饥渴地吻着明日香，双臂紧紧环绕着她，双手在她背上抓挠。明日香向后弓起身体，臀部摩擦着真嗣的，感受到他胯间的反应。她很快就在这感觉中迷失，但仍尽力保持头脑清醒。

Their tongues reached one another, and soon they were entwined with one another as the exchange of saliva occurred. Asuka began heating up once again, and her body started tingling, her underwear quickly becoming moist. This wasn't enough though. She wanted more than just this. She wanted Shinji to explore her entire body. She wanted him to squeeze her butt, and brush his finger against her nipples.  
他们的舌头相互触碰，很快便缠绵在一起，唾液的交换随之发生。明日香再次感到身体发热，开始颤抖，内裤迅速变得湿润。但这还不够。她想要的不仅仅是这些。她希望真嗣能探索她的全身。她希望他捏她的臀部，用手指轻触她的乳头。

While Asuka's mind began to slow degrade into more erotic things, she didn't realize that Shinji had stopped kissing her. Slowly, it began to dawn on her, and she briefly thought bitterly that he had reached his limit, and was forcefully stopping himself. What did it take for him to take her damn it? Hadn't she done everything she could without actually telling him to just do it? Asuka didn't know it, but she was wrong in her assessment however.  
当明日香的心思逐渐沉沦于越发色情的幻想中时，她并未察觉到真嗣已经停止了亲吻。慢慢地，她开始意识到这一点，并短暂地苦涩地想，他是否已经达到了极限，正强迫自己停下来。到底需要什么才能让他接受她呢？难道她所做的一切还不够，非要她直接告诉他去做吗？明日香并不知道，但她对情况的判断其实是错误的。

Grabbing the edge of his shirt fluttering near his waist, Shinji pulled it up and over his head in one fluid motion, chucking it into a corner of the room. Asuka stared blankly back at him after he had done this, and then slowly placed a hand against his chest. Shinji shivered briefly at her touch, but Asuka then placed her other hand against his chest, and her hands started moving on their own. She explored his upper chest, as she had done multiple times before this. Her hands moved over his muscles, his nipples, his navel, and up to his broad shoulders, eventually wrapping her arms around his neck, and looking into his eyes. Without any hesitation, Asuka kissed him, wrapping her lips around his, inserting her tongue into her mouth.  
真嗣抓住飘动在他腰间的衬衫边缘，一气呵成地将其从头顶脱下，随手扔到房间的一角。明日香在他做完这一切后茫然地看着他，然后缓缓地将一只手放在他的胸前。真嗣在她触碰的瞬间微微颤抖，但明日香随即用另一只手也贴上他的胸膛，双手开始不由自主地移动。她探索着他宽阔的胸膛，就像之前多次做过的那样。她的手滑过他的肌肉、乳头、肚脐，直至宽阔的肩膀，最终环抱住他的脖子，凝视着他的眼睛。毫不犹豫地，明日香吻了他，双唇紧贴，舌尖探入他的口中。

Now that his shirt was off as well, the sensation of Asuka's breasts, concealed by nothing but a bra, pressing against his chest was almost too much for Shinji. Asuka wasn't large breasted by any means, but neither was she small. They were average, and while Asuka still had room to grow, it wasn't like they weren't large enough for Shinji. They would fit perfectly in his hand, giving him plenty to play with, but even with them pressed against his chest, he could tell how flexible they were. Just by glancing down at her chest, he could see the moderate gap between her breasts, and longed to plunge his hand down that mysterious gap.  
现在他的衬衫也脱掉了，仅穿着胸罩的明日香胸部紧贴在他胸前的感觉，对真嗣来说几乎难以承受。明日香并不算大胸，但也绝非小巧。它们中等大小，尽管明日香仍有成长空间，但并不意味着它们对真嗣来说不够大。它们能完美地落入他的手中，让他有足够的把玩空间，即便紧贴着他的胸膛，他也能感受到它们的柔软弹性。只需瞥一眼她的胸部，他就能看到那适中的乳沟，渴望将手探入那神秘的缝隙。

Asuka caught him looking, and give him a slight smirk, before drawing his eyes back to her face, kissing him, her lips sucking against his own. Her nails clawed at his back, creating scratch marks, making Shinji shiver. Asuka didn't care about the moisture between her legs, even though her underwear was slick now. She lost herself in her kiss with Shinji, as their hands ran along each others backs. Asuka's mind had shut off entirely.  
明日香察觉到他在看，微微一笑，然后将他的目光引回她的脸庞，吻着他，她的唇紧贴着他的。她的指甲在他背上划出痕迹，让真嗣颤抖。明日香不在乎双腿间的湿润，尽管她的内裤已经湿透。她在与真嗣的亲吻中迷失了自己，他们的手在彼此的背上摸索。明日香的心思已经完全关闭了。

Pressing her hips against his, she created friction against his groin, pleased that the expression on Shinji's face showed his discomfort and pleasure. She wasn't done though. Firmly securing her arms around his neck, Asuka took one quick glance at Shinji, before she jumped slightly, her legs wrapping around his hips, while her own hips pressed against his. Shinji had just enough time to register what she was about to do, and was able to support her with his arms around her waist, though his hands were incredibly close to her butt.. He wasn't sure how long he could maintain this position, even though Asuka was pretty light.  
将臀部紧贴着他，她在他胯部制造摩擦，满意地看到真嗣脸上显露出不适与愉悦交织的表情。然而，她并未就此罢休。她坚定地将双臂环抱在他的脖颈上，阿斯卡迅速瞥了真嗣一眼，随即轻盈一跃，双腿环绕住他的腰际，同时自己的臀部紧压着他的。真嗣刚来得及意识到她即将的动作，便用双臂环住她的腰间予以支撑，尽管他的手离她的臀部仅咫尺之遥。他不确定自己能维持这个姿势多久，即便阿斯卡相当轻盈。

They continued kissing, with their bodies entwined with one other, still standing beside the bed. Shinji's groin was painfully pressing against his pants, and he wasn't sure how much longer he could deal with this pain. Having Asuka's hips pressed against his own, along with the spot between her legs wasn't making it any easier. He was surprised to find that Asuka was wet herself, and he could feel the moisture from her underwear seeping into his own pants. Shinji hadn't realized Asuka was this aroused, though judging by the way she was kissing him, she wasn't worried about that. This only served to turn him on further though, and he had a sudden desire to touch that spot between her legs.  
他们继续拥吻，身体紧紧相缠，依然站在床边。真嗣的胯部痛苦地紧贴着裤子，他不确定自己还能忍受这种疼痛多久。明日香的臀部紧贴着他的，以及她双腿间的那处地方，这一切都让情况变得更加艰难。他惊讶地发现明日香自己也湿了，他能感觉到她内裤的湿润渗透进他的裤子。真嗣没有意识到明日香如此兴奋，尽管从她吻他的方式来看，她似乎并不担心这一点。这反而让他更加兴奋，他突然有一种想要触碰她双腿间那处地方的冲动。

Soon though, Shinji found that he couldn't keep clinging onto Asuka in such a way, and he turned towards the bed, laying her down on it, before collapsing beside her. He was panting heavily with his eyes closed. If it was now, he probably had enough time to change into something more comfortable like sweats or shorts since Asuka seemed to be fairly tired herself.  
然而不久，真嗣发现自己无法继续这样紧抱着明日香，他转向床，将她放倒在床上，然后自己也瘫倒在旁边。他闭着眼睛，喘着粗气。如果现在是时候，他或许有时间换上更舒适的衣物，比如运动裤或短裤，因为明日香似乎也相当疲惫。

This quickly changed though, and Asuka suddenly pressed her lips against his, before climbing on top of him, straddling his waist. She was practically sitting on his groin, and Shinji had to fight back the urge to push her off because it hurt so much. If he thought this was bad though, Asuka slowly began grinding against him, her hips moving backwards and forwards. She was grinning seductively, and Shinji knew she was thoroughly enjoying his discomfort. If this continued, Shinji knew he wouldn't be able to hold back any more, and would explode.  
然而，这一情况很快发生了变化，明日香突然吻上了他的唇，随即跨坐在他身上，双腿夹住他的腰。她几乎坐在他的胯部，这让真嗣不得不强忍住推开她的冲动，因为实在太疼了。但如果说这已经很糟糕了，明日香开始慢慢在他身上磨蹭，臀部前后移动。她带着诱惑的笑容，真嗣知道她正充分享受着他的不适。如果这种情况继续下去，真嗣知道自己再也控制不住，即将爆发。

Before this was allowed to happen, Shinji sat up, grabbing Asuka's shoulders and throwing her down on the bed. Asuka looked like she wasn't very happy about this, and was about to complain when Shinji stood up. Immediately, he unbuttoned his pants while facing away from her, and stripped them off himself. Pulling on a very loose pair of sweats, Asuka blushed immensely when he turned back to her. There was a significant bulge pressing against the fabric, not leaving anything to the imagination of what it was. But now that Shinji was done changing, and thoroughly more comfortable, he intended to repay Asuka for what she had done.  
在这即将发生之前，真嗣坐起身来，抓住明日香的肩膀将她推倒在床上。明日香看起来对此颇为不满，正要抱怨时，真嗣站了起来。他立刻背对着她解开裤子，自己脱了下来。换上一条非常宽松的运动裤后，当他转回身面对明日香时，她脸红得厉害。布料下明显凸起的轮廓，让人无法忽视那是什么。但现在真嗣已经换好衣服，感觉舒服多了，他打算回报明日香刚才的所作所为。

He slowly approached her, his eyes clinging to her well formed body, and Asuka felt her heart flutter at his gaze. She had sat up when he had gotten up, worried that he had reached his limit, but now she was slowly falling back to the bed as he approached her. Enveloping her entire body with his, Shinji brought his lips to hers, kissing her sweetly. Asuka enjoyed this kiss, but then she felt a strong shock coming near her waist. Shinji had placed a hand against her thigh, and was running a single finger against her skin, his finger nail creating faint lines against her smooth skin. Asuka started squirming, her body tingling, and small moans began leaking out of her mouth, all the while, the wetness between her legs continued flowing.  
他缓缓向她靠近，目光紧锁在她匀称的身躯上，而明日香在他的注视下心跳加速。当他起身时，她便坐了起来，担心他已达到极限，但此刻随着他的接近，她又慢慢倒回床上。真嗣将全身覆盖在她之上，唇瓣轻柔地贴上她的，甜蜜地亲吻着。明日香享受着这个吻，但随即感到腰间传来一阵强烈的冲击。真嗣将手放在她的大腿上，用一根手指在她肌肤上轻轻划过，指甲在她光滑的皮肤上留下淡淡的痕迹。明日香开始扭动，身体阵阵酥麻，小声的呻吟从她口中逸出，与此同时，她双腿间的湿润感持续涌动。

Shinji's finger slowly started moving its way upwards, passing over her underwear, and lingered at her stomach. Shinji watched her face squirm as he moved his finger in a circle along her belly, enjoying the different expressions she was making. For all the teasing that Asuka gave him, she was very weak against such means herself. As Asuka's opened her mouth to leak out her small voice filled with pleasure, Shinji silenced her, kissing her strongly, inserting his tongue into her mouth. Asuka wrapped her arms around him clinging to him, returning the kiss desperately.  
真嗣的手指缓缓向上移动，掠过她的内裤，停留在她的腹部。真嗣注视着她的脸因他的手指在肚皮上画圈而扭曲，享受着她不断变化的表情。尽管明日香总是逗弄他，但她自己对这种手段却异常脆弱。当明日香张开嘴，发出充满愉悦的细小声音时，真嗣用一个强吻堵住了她的嘴，舌头探入她的口中。明日香双臂环抱住他，紧紧依附，急切地回应着这个吻。

Breaking off the kiss, Shinji redirected his gaze to Asuka's belly, his finger now moving further up. Asuka saw this, shivering as he touched her. He was reaching her breasts slowly, but he was taking his leisurely time, something which Asuka had noticed. He really was teasing her as much as possible, and Asuka was reaching her limit of anticipation, when Shinji's hand reached her bra. Asuka didn't know what she expected, and she didn't think Shinji knew what he was doing either, but she just let things happen as they would.  
结束这个吻后，真嗣将目光转向明日香的腹部，手指继续向上移动。明日香看到这一幕，因他的触碰而颤抖。他正慢慢接近她的胸部，但动作却异常悠闲，这一点明日香注意到了。他确实在尽可能地逗弄她，而明日香也即将达到期待的极限，这时真嗣的手触到了她的胸罩。明日香不知道自己期待什么，也不认为真嗣知道自己正在做什么，但她只是任由事情自然发展。

Shinji stopped though, his eyes fixated on her breasts, but he wanted to be sure this is what Asuka wanted before he did anything else. Even though she had been teasing him immensely earlier, this went farther than that.  
真嗣停了下来，他的目光紧盯着她的胸部，但他想确保这是否是明日香想要的，然后才采取进一步行动。尽管她之前一直在极大地挑逗他，但这已经超出了那个范畴。

"Asuka, just to be absolutely sure, this is something you want?"  
“明日香，只是为了完全确定，这是你想要的吗？”

（作者注：接下来的几页（是的，几页）包含性行为，但没有实际的性交。简要总结在最后。一如既往，寻找下一个粗体字标记）**

Asuka would have grabbed Shinji's hand herself and placed it against her breast if she wanted to, but she'd rather him do it under his own power. Having Shinji do all these things himself was something that Asuka what. So, she simply nodded once to give her reply. Shinji looked at her for a few seconds longer, before he stared back at her breasts again, concealed by her bra, and then slowly placed his hand over her right breast, cupping it softly.  
如果她愿意，明日香本可以自己抓住真嗣的手放在她的胸前，但她更希望他能凭借自己的力量去做。让真嗣自己完成这些事情，是明日香所期望的。所以，她只是简单地点了点头作为回应。真嗣又看了她几秒钟，然后再次盯着她被胸罩遮住的胸部，慢慢地将手放在她的右胸上，轻轻地捧着。

Truthfully, Shinji had long gone passed the point of knowing what to do, and was just fumbling things along the way, though this didn't seem to matter much to Asuka. Her panting grew ragged as he began to slowly fondle her breast, and even though he was clumsy, it was endearing in a way that relaxed Asuka. She bit her lips, enjoying the feel of his hand against her soft breast, but there was still a problem; Shinji was only cupping it from outside the bra, and while this was pleasant, Asuka wanted to experience things further.  
说实话，真嗣早已过了知道该做什么的阶段，只是在摸索中前进，但这似乎对明日香来说并不重要。随着他开始慢慢抚弄她的胸部，她的呼吸变得急促起来，尽管他笨手笨脚，但在某种程度上却让明日香感到放松。她咬着嘴唇，享受着他的手在她柔软的胸部上的感觉，但还有一个问题；真嗣只是隔着胸罩捧着她的胸部，虽然这很愉快，但明日香想要更进一步的体验。

Wrapping her legs around him, she pulled him closer, kissing him briefly, and then arched her back, pressing her hips against his. Shinji ignored the sudden friction against his groin, continuing to focus on Asuka's breast. Slipping a hand inside her bra, he grasped her breast with his hand, and quickly became lost massaging Asuka's soft flesh. The texture was unbelievable, and Shinji couldn't help but wish he had done this sooner.  
她用双腿环住他，将他拉近，短暂地吻了他一下，然后拱起背部，将臀部紧贴着他。真嗣忽略了胯部突如其来的摩擦，继续专注于明日香的双乳。他一只手滑入她的胸罩内，握住她的乳房，很快便沉醉于按摩明日香柔软的肌肤之中。那触感难以置信，真嗣不禁希望自己能早点这么做。

Asuka was throughly enjoying this on a whole different level than Shinji. This was nothing like when she did it herself. Having somebody else's hands pressed against her breast, and rubbing against her erect nipple was far different than when she pleasured herself. Shinji's clumsiness was almost more arousing than if he knew what he was doing. Asuka held back her voice as much as possible, but everything below her waist was tingling wildly.  
明日香在这件事上的享受程度与真嗣截然不同。这与她自己动手时完全不同。别人的手按在她的乳房上，摩擦着她挺立的乳头，远比她自慰时来得刺激。真嗣的笨拙几乎比他熟练时更令人兴奋。明日香尽可能地压抑自己的声音，但腰部以下的感觉却异常强烈。

As Shinji continued fondling her, he started to become more daring. His hand was cupping her breast, and even though he couldn't see what he was doing, since his hand had slipped inside her bra, he was relying on his sense of touch instead of sight to pleasure her. His fingers rolled around her erect nipple, pinching her slowly. Shinji couldn't help but smile slightly as he glanced at Asuka's face, indescribable pleasure plastered across it. He was no longer content with just feeling her breast though, and suddenly flipped her bra up, and over both of her breasts revealing them to him.  
随着真嗣继续抚摸她，他的胆子也越来越大。他的手托着她的乳房，尽管他看不见自己的动作，因为他的手已经滑进了她的胸罩里，但他依靠触觉而非视觉来取悦她。他的手指绕着她挺立的乳头转动，慢慢地捏着。真嗣忍不住微微一笑，瞥了一眼明日香的脸，她脸上洋溢着难以言喻的愉悦。不过，他不再满足于仅仅感受她的乳房，突然间将她的胸罩向上翻起，露出她的双乳。

Shinji stared for a long while at her, ignoring the sudden stuttering from Asuka who seemed to have quickly grown embarrassed. It had been months since he had seen them in the hot springs, though he honestly wasn't sure how much he they had grown since then. The one thing he did notice immediately, was how erect her pink nipples were. It was one thing to feel them against his fingers, but actually seeing them, and knowing that she was aroused was entirely different. Shinji felt himself growing even harder as he stared at her breasts, and cupped both of them, slowly starting to massaging them.  
真嗣盯着她看了许久，忽略了明日香突然的结巴，她似乎很快就感到害羞了。自从几个月前在温泉见过她的胸部后，他就不太确定它们是否有所增长。他立刻注意到的一件事是，她的粉红色乳头是多么挺立。用手指感受是一回事，但亲眼看到，并知道她被激起了欲望，则是完全不同的体验。真嗣感到自己变得更加坚硬，他盯着她的胸部，双手托起它们，开始慢慢地按摩。

He carefully explored every inch of her soft flesh. There was no blemish on her smooth skin, no sign of imperfection, or lumps of any kind. They were well rounded, and soft, fitting almost perfectly in his hands. He marveled at them, unable to tear his eyes away from this sight. Shinji was so focused on her breasts, that he hardly noticed the expressions that were rapidly appearing on Asuka's face.  
他小心翼翼地探索着她柔软肌肤的每一寸。她光滑的皮肤上没有瑕疵，没有任何不完美或肿块的迹象。它们圆润而柔软，几乎完美地贴合在他的手中。他惊叹于它们，无法将目光从这景象上移开。真嗣如此专注于她的胸部，以至于几乎没有注意到明日香脸上迅速出现的表情。

This still wasn't enough for Shinji however. He had restrained himself for so long, and had nearly thought about Asuka's breasts every day since that winter day at the hot springs, so he was releasing all his pent up desires without realizing it. Leaning down to her chest, Shinji took one quick glance up at Asuka, but saw that she was in her own world, her hands covering her forehead as waves of ecstasy exuded off of her. Only imagining what sort of reaction he would get from her, Shinji drew incredibly close to Asuka's left breast so that his lips were mere inches away from it, and breathed softly on her nipple.  
然而，这对真嗣来说仍然不够。他自我克制了太久，自从那个冬日在温泉的日子以来，几乎每天都在想着明日香的胸部，所以他不知不觉中释放了所有积压的欲望。他俯身向她的胸口，迅速瞥了一眼明日香，但看到她沉浸在自己的世界中，双手捂着额头，一波波的快感从她身上散发出来。只是想象着她会有什么样的反应，真嗣极其靠近明日香的左胸，以至于他的嘴唇离她的乳头只有几英寸，轻轻地向她的乳头吹气。

Asuka's entire body jerked with such force, her hips crashing against Shinji's, as her legs wrapped themselves tighter around Shinji, pulling him closer to her. Shinji was propelled forward, his face firmly pressed against her breasts. Asuka let out a low shriek, the spot between her legs tingling pleasantly.  
明日香全身猛地一震，臀部重重地撞在真嗣的身上，双腿更紧地缠绕着他，将他拉向自己。真嗣被推向前，脸紧紧贴在她的胸前。明日香发出一声低沉的尖叫，双腿间传来一阵愉悦的酥麻感。

Shinji refocused his advances though, and with his face buried in Asuka's breasts, he started fondling them again, but quickly changed his method of attack. Turning to face her left breast, his hand continued focusing on her right, while he brushed his lips against the smooth skin of her left breast. He started kissing her softly, his kisses trailing up until he found Asuka's nipple. Her body was still squirming uncontrollably, and when he placed his lips around her pink nipple, he thought Asuka might snap his back in half with the amount of force she was mustering from her legs.  
然而，真嗣重新调整了攻势，脸埋在明日香的胸前，再次开始爱抚她的乳房，但很快改变了策略。转向她的左乳，手继续专注于右乳，同时用嘴唇轻拂她左乳光滑的皮肤。他开始温柔地亲吻她，吻痕一路向上，直到找到明日香的乳头。她的身体仍在不由自主地扭动，当他将嘴唇环绕在她粉嫩的乳头上时，他觉得明日香可能会用双腿的力量将他的脊背折断。

He started sucking on her nipple, his tongue rolling around it, covering every inch of the protrusion. He heard his own name start to be called by Asuka as the pleasure washed over her, but his mind was only focusing on her erect nipple. The inside of his mouth grew hot as his saliva continued to mix with her skin. Redoubling his focus on her right breast, his thumb rolled around her nipple, and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger. As he did this, he completed his last means of attack. Carefully, he placed Asuka's erect nipple between his teeth, and bit gently into it.  
他开始吮吸她的乳头，舌头在其周围滚动，覆盖了凸起的每一寸。他听到自己的名字被明日香呼唤，随着快感席卷她，但他的心思只集中在她挺立的乳头上。他的口腔内部因唾液与她肌肤的混合而变得温热。他更加专注于她的右乳，拇指在她乳头上滚动，并用拇指和食指夹住它。当他这样做时，他完成了最后的攻击手段。小心翼翼地，他将明日香挺立的乳头置于齿间，轻轻咬了下去。

Asuka's wholeheartedly screamed as he did this, her voice echoing around the room. She had been trying to keep her voice down throughout all this, but she couldn't contain herself any more. The stimulus of having both her nipples toyed with was so strong, that Asuka felt something suddenly release between her legs. She had reached her climax.  
明日香全心全意地尖叫起来，声音在房间里回荡。她一直试图压低声音，但此刻再也控制不住自己。乳头同时被玩弄的刺激如此强烈，明日香感到双腿间突然释放了什么。她达到了高潮。

Removing his lips from Asuka's nipple, Shinji glanced up at her face, beads of sweat streaming down her cheeks. Moving his face closer to her, he kissed her tenderly, their tongues immediately finding each other. Asuka was significantly tired however, and could only kiss him for several seconds before she broke it off, panting wildly. She never knew she could feel this existed, and was surprised at how focused Shinji had been. A special feeling that she had difficulty describing slowly began enveloping her.  
从明日香的乳头上移开嘴唇，真嗣抬头看向她的脸，汗水顺着她的脸颊流淌。他将脸贴近她，温柔地吻了她，两人的舌头立刻交缠在一起。然而，明日香明显疲惫不堪，只能与他亲吻几秒钟便气喘吁吁地分开。她从未想过自己会有这样的感受，对真嗣的专注感到惊讶。一种难以言喻的特殊感觉缓缓包围了她。

"Asuka...are you okay?" asked Shinji, speaking for the first time in several minutes.  
“明日香……你还好吗？”真嗣问道，这是几分钟以来他第一次开口。

"Yeah," she replied, still panting slightly. Her whole body was sweating, and she thoroughly needed to wipe herself off...but she wasn't done yet. Shinji had toyed with her enough, and had given pleasure which she had never felt before. There was still something she could do.  
“嗯，”她回答，仍然微微喘息。她的全身都在出汗，急需擦拭干净……但她还没结束。真嗣已经让她体验到了前所未有的愉悦，还有一件事她可以做。

While still panting wildly, Asuka grabbed Shinji shoulders, and then flipped him onto his back, crawling on top of him. Shinji had sorta assumed that they were done, since Asuka seemed exhausted, and he himself was feeling spent in a certain way, so he was surprised by this change.  
尽管还在剧烈喘息，明日香抓住了真嗣的肩膀，然后将他翻了个身，爬到了他身上。真嗣本以为他们已经结束了，因为明日香看起来筋疲力尽，他自己也感到某种程度的疲惫，所以他对这一变化感到惊讶。

"Asuka, what are you doing?" he asked slowly.  
“明日香，你在做什么？”他缓缓问道。

Grinning slightly, Asuka said, "Returning the favor."  
明日香微微一笑，说道：“回报你。”

With her half naked body pressed against him, and her face near his watching the confused expression on his face, she enjoyed watching the sudden change as her right hand began trailing down towards his waist. Realizing what she was doing, Shinji tried to utter his rejection at this, but Asuka silenced him with a kiss. She wouldn't let him snake his way out of this, not after what he did to her. She was returning the favor afterall.  
她半裸的身体紧贴着他，脸庞靠近，观察着他脸上的困惑表情，她享受着这一刻的变化，当她的右手开始向他的腰间滑去。意识到她在做什么，真嗣试图表达他的拒绝，但明日香用一个吻让他闭嘴。她不会让他就这样溜走，尤其是在他对她做了那些事之后。毕竟，她只是在回报他。

Her hand continued moving towards his waist, passing over his stomach, before pausing at his hips. Asuka felt a bit nervous about what she was doing, but she was also prepared. She continued kissing Shinji, effectively silencing any reply from him, but she thought that he might be beyond carrying at this point. Stealing herself for the finally push, she slowly moved her hand to his groin.  
她的手继续向他的腰间移动，掠过他的腹部，然后在臀部停顿。明日香对自己正在做的事情感到有些紧张，但她已经做好了准备。她继续亲吻着真嗣，有效地阻止了他任何回应，但她认为他此刻可能已经无法自持。鼓起勇气，她慢慢地将手移向他的下体。

She wasn't surprised to find that he was still erect, though she was surprised at how hot it was, even through the sweats and boxers he was wearing. Just as Shinji was, Asuka didn't know what she was doing, and starting fumbling through things, but Shinji didn't seem to mind this in the least. She slowly ran her finger along his bulge, going up one end, and briefly lingering on the tip, before trailing down the other side. Shinji shivered uncontrollably at this movement, and Asuka thought she noticed a stain starting to spread, seeping through his sweats.  
她并不惊讶地发现他依旧坚挺，尽管她对他的热度感到意外，即便隔着他穿的休闲裤和内裤。就像真嗣一样，明日香也不知道自己在做什么，开始笨拙地摸索，但真嗣似乎一点也不介意。她缓缓地用手指沿着他的隆起滑动，从一端向上，短暂地停留在顶端，然后沿着另一侧滑下。真嗣因这一动作不由自主地颤抖，明日香觉得她注意到一处污渍开始扩散，渗过他的休闲裤。

Grasping the whole thing in her hand, Asuka slowly started stroking it. She couldn't help but smile inwardly as she saw Shinji's eyes glaze over as she continued stimulating him. Soon, all of Shinji's thoughts were cut off, and he even forgot about kissing her, at which point Asuka stopped as well. He was beyond protesting at this point, so Asuka focused on what she had clasped between her hand.  
明日香握住整个部位，开始慢慢抚弄。她忍不住在心里微笑，因为她看到真嗣的眼睛因她的刺激而变得迷离。很快，真嗣的所有思绪都被切断，他甚至忘记了亲吻她，这时明日香也停了下来。他此时已无力抗议，于是明日香专注于她手中握着的东西。

Asuka didn't have anything to compare it to, but Asuka couldn't help but think Shinji slightly big. She wondered how different it would be to feel it without the clothes between it, but she wasn't sure she was ready for that quite yet. Shinji had only touched her breasts, and her she was stroking his manhood. She could feel it twitching in her hand, and wondered how close he was to his climax.  
明日香没有比较的对象，但她不禁觉得真嗣有些过于大了。她好奇如果隔着衣服感受会是什么感觉，但她不确定自己是否已经准备好面对那一切。真嗣只摸过她的胸部，而她却在抚摸他的男性象征。她能感觉到它在手中跳动，不知道他离高潮还有多远。

She began moving her hand faster, pleasuring Shinji. This should feel dirty to her, but it oddly didn't. She found herself slowly growing wet again, and tried ignoring that. She had already had her turn afterall.  
她开始加快手上的动作，取悦真嗣。这本应让她感到肮脏，但奇怪的是并没有。她发现自己又慢慢湿润起来，试图忽视这一点。毕竟，她已经享受过自己的时刻了。

She began alternating her motions, going faster and then slower, occasionally tracing her finger along his tip. Shinji began panting wildly, his body jerking slightly. Asuka smiled at him, and redoubled her efforts, going even faster. She couldn't help but feel that she should do more somehow, and suddenly decided to do to Shinji what he had done to her. Moving her face away from his, she drew close to his chest, and started kissing him there, all the while her hand working at his erection. Her lips traveling along his skin, kissing him everywhere, before finding his nipple. Her tongue lolled out, as she began to lick him, something which Shinji hadn't done himself. She was glad to see his expression had change again, and that he seemed to be slightly embarrassed.  
她开始交替变换动作，时而加快时而放缓，偶尔用手指沿着他的顶端划过。真嗣开始急促地喘息，身体微微颤抖。明日香对他微笑，并加倍努力，动作更加迅速。她不禁觉得应该以某种方式做得更多，突然决定对真嗣做他曾对她做过的事。她将脸从他身上移开，靠近他的胸膛，开始在那里亲吻他，同时手继续在他勃起的部位上动作。她的唇沿着他的肌肤游走，亲吻每一个角落，最终找到了他的乳头。她的舌头伸出，开始舔舐，这是真嗣自己未曾尝试过的。她很高兴看到他的表情再次变化，似乎有些害羞。

Asuka's hand began working faster. The friction of her hand rubbing against his erection, and the sweats and boxers rubbing against him was too much for Shinji, and his body suddenly starting jerking. It had been many days since he had masturbated, but having this done for him was completely different, especially when it was a half naked Asuka.  
明日香的手开始更快地动作。她手上的摩擦与汗水和内裤对他的摩擦让真嗣难以承受，他的身体突然开始抽搐。他已经多日未曾自慰，但被人这样服务的感觉完全不同，尤其是当这个人是半裸的明日香时。

Shinji reached his climax, as his body gave three sudden jerks as he thrust forward slightly. He was panting wildly, and now feeling extremely tired, even though Asuka had done all the work just now. Glancing over at Asuka, he saw that she was looking at her hand slightly however, and seemed to have a slight frown on her face. Her hand was significantly moist, and Shinji felt like he should apologize for that, but Asuka didn't seem to necessarily have a problem with it either.  
真嗣达到了高潮，他的身体突然猛地抽搐了三次，同时微微向前一挺。他气喘吁吁，现在感到极度疲惫，尽管刚刚是明日香在主导一切。他瞥向明日香，发现她正略带忧虑地看着自己的手，眉头微皱。她的手明显湿润了，真嗣觉得应该为此道歉，但明日香似乎对此并不介意。

**(A/N: Ends here. Basically, Shinji plays with Asuka's breasts, eventually bringing her to her climax, and then she gives him a handjob , bringing him to climax as well.)  
（作者注：至此结束。基本上，真嗣玩弄明日香的胸部，最终让她达到高潮，然后她给他手淫，也让他达到高潮。）**

Letting out a low sigh, Asuka glanced back at Shinji. She wasn't entirely sure what to say right now, but she did know she needed to clean herself off.  
明日香轻轻叹了口气，回头看向真嗣。她不太确定现在该说什么，但她知道自己需要清理一下。

Swinging her legs out of the bed, she didn't bother putting on her bra, but went into the bathroom. Shinji waited for his turn, and when she came back, Asuka was in a new pair of underwear, but she hadn't bothered to put on a bra. Shinji didn't even have enough energy to feel anything from this, even though he still thought her beautiful.  
她从床上晃着腿下来，懒得穿胸衣，径直走进了浴室。真嗣等着轮到自己，当她回来时，明日香已经换上了一套新的内衣，但依旧没费心穿胸衣。真嗣连感到什么的力气都没有了，尽管他仍然觉得她很美。

Entering the bathroom himself, he changed out of his soiled boxers and sweats, and thoroughly cleaned off his privates, before dawning a new pair of boxers. Wiping the sweat off his body, he wished that he could take a shower. Well, tomorrow they'd probably have to go to the hot spring to properly clean themselves. He had a nagging suspicion that if they started doing this everyday, they'd be spending a lot more time there.  
他走进浴室，换掉了脏兮兮的内裤和运动裤，仔细清洗了私处，然后穿上了一条新内裤。擦去身上的汗水，他真希望能洗个澡。嗯，明天他们可能得去温泉好好洗洗。他有种不祥的预感，如果他们每天都这样，恐怕会在那里花上更多时间。

Reentering the bedroom, he saw Asuka sitting upright on the bed. She still hadn't bothered to put a bra on, and for a second, Shinji's eyes became transfixed on her breasts once again, before he tore his eyes away to look at her face. Asuka was patting the spot next to her, signifying that she wanted them to sit beside each other for a minute. Shinji did so, climbing on the bed to sit beside her, his legs crossed in front of him.  
回到卧室，他看到明日香笔直地坐在床上。她还是没费心穿胸衣，有那么一瞬间，真嗣的目光再次被她的胸部吸引，但他很快移开视线，看向她的脸。明日香拍了拍她旁边的位置，示意他想让他们坐在一起一会儿。真嗣照做了，爬上床坐在她旁边，双腿交叉在前。

"So...um-," started Shinji.  
"所以...呃-," 真嗣开口道。

"Shinji...I'm happy," said Asuka, cutting him off before he could make a stupid comment. "I haven't felt like this in a while. Truthfully, thank you. I feel like a idiot for trying to seduce you while drunk now. I should have known better."  
"真嗣...我很开心，" 明日香打断了他，不让他说出什么蠢话。"我已经很久没有这种感觉了。说实话，谢谢你。我现在觉得自己喝醉了还想勾引你真是傻。我早该知道不该这样的。

"...Well, I was holding back myself anyway," said Shinji as she scratched the back of his head. "And like you said, I shouldn't have just left everything to you. On another note...do you plan on sleeping like that?" he asked, gesturing towards her near nakedness.  
"...嗯，反正我也在克制自己，" 真嗣说着挠了挠后脑勺。"就像你说的，我不该把一切都推给你。另外...你打算就这样睡吗？" 他问道，指了指她近乎赤裸的样子。

Glancing down at her own bare chest, Asuka smirked slightly before asking, "Why? Does it before you?"  
瞥了一眼自己赤裸的胸膛，明日香微微一笑，然后问道：“为什么？难道它让你困扰吗？”

'Yes and no,' thought Shinji. 'No for obvious reasons, and yes because I think I'll be hard all night.'  
“是也不是，”真嗣心想，“不是因为显而易见的原因，而是因为我感觉今晚可能会一直硬着。”

In the end, Shinji just shrugged, and kissed Asuka briefly, before crawling back to the pillows, and laying down on his. Asuka did so as well, tucking herself under the blankets, before rolling over to Shinji's side. Thankfully, she didn't press her breasts against his bare chest, and had her back to him instead, so at least she was considerate for his wellbeing in some manner.  
最终，真嗣只是耸了耸肩，轻轻吻了明日香一下，然后爬回枕头边，躺在了自己的枕头上。明日香也跟着躺下，钻进被子，然后转身面向真嗣的一侧。幸运的是，她没有将自己的胸部压在他赤裸的胸膛上，而是背对着他，至少在某种程度上考虑到了他的感受。

Slowly though, Shinji wrapped his arms around her middle, and pressed his face against her silky hair, inhaling her sent deeply. He hadn't told her yet, that he loved her, but there was still plenty of time left for that.  
然而渐渐地，真嗣用双臂环抱住她的腰间，将脸颊贴在她柔滑的秀发上，深深地吸了一口她的香气。他还没有告诉她，他爱她，但还有足够的时间去说。

Sighing deeply into her hair, Shinji, and Asuka as well, fell asleep together, wrapped in each others warmth.  
在她的发间深深叹息，真嗣和明日香一起，在彼此的温暖中沉沉睡去。

**So first off, this chapter is more than 13k words, and the longest chapter in Two of Us so far. Considering I ended up cutting some stuff out of the previous chapter, I ended up going all out with this chapter, which is why there are about six pages of paragraphs straight, dedicated to Shinji and Asuka fooling around. With that said, there was one large piece that I omitted since this was getting too long, plus I still gotta save a couple things for the next two chapters.  
首先，这一章超过 13,000 字，是迄今为止《我们俩》中最长的一章。考虑到我删减了前一章的一些内容，这次我全力以赴，因此有大约六页的段落专门描述真嗣和明日香嬉戏打闹。尽管如此，我还是省略了一大段，因为篇幅已经太长，而且我还得为接下来的两章留些料。**

**Onto the sudden update. For anybody that works, I'm sure you'll have the feeling of days just blending together. Same thing happened to me, and about four days ago I think it was, I realized that Valentines was less than 2 weeks away or so. And with that, I plan on releasing the next two chapters of the rest of the first half on Valentines Day. Gonna by a long two weeks, but this chapter was finished in less than a week, so no problems hopefully.  
关于这次突然的更新。对于任何工作的人来说，我确信你们会有那种日子混在一起的感觉。同样的事情发生在我身上，大约四天前，我意识到情人节不到两周了。因此，我计划在情人节当天发布接下来的两章，即第一部分的后半部分。接下来的两周可能会很长，但这一章不到一周就完成了，所以希望没有问题。**

**Lastly, and I'm a bit unsure about it, but the A/N warnings for anybody that skipped them, were they in a suitable place? It felt odd trying to determine where the proper cutoff point was for content which may be too explicit for some readers, but I think I got it at a suitable spot. If not, feel free to let me know, and I'll adjust the warning.  
最后，我对此有点不确定，但那些跳过 A/N 警告的人，它们的位置合适吗？试图确定对某些读者来说可能过于露骨的内容的适当截止点感觉很奇怪，但我认为我找到了一个合适的位置。如果没有，请随时告诉我，我会调整警告。**

**Other than that, look forward to the double update in around two weeks.  
除此之外，期待大约两周后的双更。**

### Chapter 28: Future

**First chapter to come out today. I'll talk about a few things in the next one. Oh, and only one A/N warning. Look for bold lettering as usual.  
今天发布的第一章。下一章我会谈及几件事。哦，还有一个 A/N 警告。一如既往地寻找粗体字。**

---

When was the last time this had happened? Days? Weeks? Months? Years? What was it truly afterall when it came down to it? What was the significance behind his own existence? Why did he exist? For himself? For her? For a possible future, the time which hadn't come yet?  
上一次发生这种情况是什么时候？几天前？几周前？几个月前？几年前？当一切归结起来时，这究竟意味着什么？他存在的意义是什么？他为什么存在？为了自己？为了她？为了一个可能的未来，那个尚未到来的时刻？

The sky above his head was blue, so blue that the ocean in which he floated in seemed to be a direct reflection of the sky. Not a single cloud loomed overhead, but the sun beat down on his face anyway. He shielded his eyes, trying to block out the glare, but the sun still somehow managed to pierce through his fingers.  
他头顶的天空是如此湛蓝，以至于他漂浮其中的海洋仿佛是天空的直接映照。头顶上没有一片云彩，但阳光依旧无情地洒在他的脸上。他遮住眼睛，试图挡住刺眼的光芒，但阳光仍能透过他的指缝。

Sitting up, be began wondering why he was even floating in the water in the first place, especially since he could just as easily walk on the water. Looking down at his own body, he saw that he was naked, but not a single drop of water clung to his skin. In the first place, where was this anyway?  
坐起身来，他开始疑惑自己为何会漂浮在水中，尤其是他明明可以轻松地在水面上行走。低头看着自己的身体，他发现自己一丝不挂，但皮肤上却没有一滴水珠。话说回来，这里到底是哪里？

He looked around, but as far as the eye could see, the only thing that surrounded him was the blue ocean, and the blue sky above his head. How had he ended up here? He couldn't remember anything before this in the first place, so he was unsure. Should he start walking? Is it possible he isn't the only person here? Maybe if he tried walking, he'd eventually find these answer?  
他环顾四周，但放眼望去，除了环绕他的蓝色海洋和头顶的蓝天，别无他物。他是如何来到这里的？他连之前的事情都记不清了，所以感到不确定。他应该开始行走吗？这里可能不止他一个人吗？或许他试着走一走，最终能找到这些答案？

He did just that, choosing a direction at random, and started walking. He felt nothing while he walked. The sensation of the water between his toes, the wind which was blowing against his face: it was like his five senses didn't exist. What was the point in even having his eyes open then?  
他正是这样做的，随意选了个方向，便开始行走。行走间，他感受不到任何东西。脚趾间的水流，迎面吹来的风：仿佛他的五感都不复存在。那么，睁着眼睛又有什么意义呢？

He tried closing them, but for some reason, he could still see in front of him, even though everything had been shrouded in darkness. Even if he couldn't see, couldn't feel, and couldn't hear, he was still moving forward to the future, whatever it entailed.  
他尝试闭上眼睛，但不知为何，眼前的一切虽被黑暗笼罩，他却依然能看见。即便看不见、感觉不到、听不到，他仍在向未来前进，无论那未来包含着什么。

He had no idea how long he continued walking for, only that the concept of time began alluding him. He didn't know where he had started, and where he had come from. His thoughts were blank, though his feet continued moving forward. The past didn't matter, and had already slipped away from his mind, already having been forgotten. What was laying ahead for him? Was there anything in the first place, or was he just being hopeful?  
他不知道自己走了多久，只知道时间的概念开始变得模糊。他不记得起点在哪，也不记得来时的路。思绪空白，双脚却依旧前行。过去已无关紧要，早已从记忆中溜走，被遗忘。前方等待着他的是什么？是否真的有东西在等待，还是他只是在抱有希望？

Why hopeful? What did he hope to gain if he continued moving? He didn't know who he was, or even where he was. Hope was a foreign concept to him. What did it mean for him to exist in this empty world? Was it meaningless, his attempts at moving forward? If this was it, then maybe he should just give up, and lie down until death greeted him?  
为何怀抱希望？如果他继续前行，他希望得到什么？他不知道自己是谁，甚至不知道自己在哪里。希望对他来说是个陌生的概念。在这个空无一物的世界中存在对他意味着什么？他试图前进的努力是否毫无意义？如果这就是全部，那么也许他应该放弃，躺下直到死亡来临？

He kept walking though, some force seeming to drive him forward.  
然而，他继续走着，某种力量似乎在推动他前进。

The sun never moved, the ocean never changed, and the sky never grew dark. Time was frozen in this plane of existence, except for the young teenager who walked along the waters surface. He was alone in this sea of nothingness. He was a unique individual, unlike anybody else who had ever existed in the world. He was alone.  
太阳从未移动，海洋从未变化，天空也从未变暗。在这个存在的平面上，时间仿佛凝固了，除了沿着水面行走的年轻少年。他孤独地在这片虚无的海洋中。他是一个独特的个体，与世界上任何其他存在都不同。他是孤独的。

No, not quite alone it seemed.  
不，似乎并不完全孤单。

In the distance, a figure arose beyond the horizon in which his eyesight could pierce. When he noticed this, his feet quickened, and he began speeding up, racing towards the figure in the distance. The person seemed to have noticed him as well, because they too sped up, running towards him. He had wait and hoped for another person within this world, and he had finally found one. The first emotion he'd ever felt began welling up inside him as he neared the figure.  
在远方，地平线之外，一个身影逐渐显现，他的视线能够穿透那片天际。当他注意到这一点时，他的脚步加快了，开始加速向那个身影跑去。对方似乎也注意到了他，同样加快了速度，朝他跑来。他一直期待着在这个世界里找到另一个人，而现在他终于找到了。随着他逐渐接近那个身影，他第一次感受到的情感开始在内心涌动。

But something was off. 但有些不对劲。

His pace slowed down to a jog, and eventually to a walk, before arriving directly in front of the other person. He stared at the face so familiar to him, and then slowly raised up his own hand in front of the person. The person did the same, raising his own hand in a parallel motion with the teenager, matching his movements directly towards him, almost mirroring his actions. It wasn't similar to a mirror though, it was a mirror.  
他的步伐从慢跑逐渐减缓，最终变为步行，直至直接站在另一个人面前。他凝视着那张如此熟悉的面孔，然后缓缓举起自己的手，置于对方眼前。对方也同样举起手，以平行的动作与他相呼应，两人的动作几乎如出一辙，宛如镜像。这并非相似，它就是一面镜子。

The teenage boy was staring back into his own face. Every action he performed, his other self performed as well. He pressed his hand against his other selfs hand, staring at the same actions being taken by his other self. Were there two of him, and this was just some game that some supernatural force was playing with them? Was it possible this was just the end of the world? Or, was this simply a mirror of himself, reflecting everything both negative, and pleasant about him?  
少年凝视着自己的脸庞，每一个动作，他的镜像都如影随形。他将手掌贴向镜中的手，注视着镜像重复着自己的每一个动作。难道有两个他，这只是某种超自然力量在玩弄他们的游戏吗？这是否预示着世界的终结？或者，这只是他自身的一个镜像，映照出他所有的负面与美好？

What was true, and what wasn't? What was happening? What was the significance towards this? Did it have any meaning in the first place? Another emotion, something which he couldn't understand, or even grasp the concept of starting filling him. Raging anger, boiling from within him started surfacing. Why was this happening to him? He didn't deserve this! How was it that this whole world was so empty? Why was he the only person here!?  
什么是真实的，什么又是虚幻的？正在发生什么？这一切又意味着什么？它从一开始就有意义吗？另一种情感，一种他无法理解甚至无法把握的概念开始充斥他的内心。狂怒在他体内沸腾，逐渐浮现。为什么这一切会发生在他身上？他不配得到这些！为什么整个世界如此空虚？为什么他是这里唯一的人！？

Then, the reflection of himself in the mirror changed. The face remained the same, but the expression changed to something he couldn't recognize. A shadow sprang out from him, even though the sun's position hadn't moved. A thin sneer appeared on his lips, almost condescending. Finally, the eyes turned a deep blood red, and seemed to be sunken deeper into the skull.  
随后，镜子中他自己的倒影发生了变化。面孔依旧，但表情变得陌生。一个影子从他身上跃出，尽管太阳的位置并未移动。他的唇边浮现出一抹几乎带有轻蔑意味的冷笑。最终，眼睛变成了深红色，似乎更深地陷入了眼窝。

The teenage boy stared back at this strange change, and felt himself speaking the the first time since he had first conceived thought in this strange world.  
少年盯着这奇怪的变化，感觉到自己第一次在这个陌生世界中产生了思考后，终于开口说话了。

"Who are you?" "你是谁？"

"I'm you." "我就是你。"

"...No," the teenager said. "Everything about you is different compared to me. I'm not you."  
"……不，“少年说，”你和我完全不同。我不是你。"

There was a long silence from the other image of him, but finally they said-  
另一边的影像中，他沉默了许久，但最终开口道——

"No, I don't suppose you are me afterall. We are alike, yet altogether different. I am something that once was and you are something which is. Be that as it may, you have your own worries to deal with, and will have problems which I never faced."  
“不，我想你终究不是我。我们相似，却又截然不同。我是曾经的存在，而你是现在的存在。尽管如此，你有你自己的烦恼要面对，也将遇到我从未面对过的问题。”

"...What do you mean?" "...你是什么意思？"

"I can't say, and it hasn't been revealed to me in the first place. You should continue to focus on the person you love though. If my decisions had been different, maybe things would have turned out differently than how they're playing out currently...but this may also be for the best."  
“我说不上来，而且一开始也没人向我透露。不过，你应该继续专注于你所爱的人。如果我的决定有所不同，也许事情的发展会有所不同……但这也可能是最好的结果。”

The teenager was dumbstruck, hardly understand what his other self was talking about. The one clear thing he understood, was that this other him understood things about himself which he didn't understand. This place, why he was here, what his name was: surely this other him knew all these things. He never got a chance to ask him though.  
那少年目瞪口呆，几乎不明白另一个自己所言何意。他唯一清楚的是，这个与他如出一辙的人，对自己有着连他自己都不甚明了的了悟。这个地方，他为何在此，他的名字是什么：这些事情，另一个他必定全都知道。然而，他从未有机会向他发问。

Pain indescribable suddenly assaulted his right left flank. Slowly, his eyes looked down at the spot between his ribs and hips. Imbedded between these two, was a large knife. Suddenly, the knife was wrenched out of his side, and a large quantity of blood began flowing out. The voice which he had used earlier couldn't even scream, since a hand was now closing over his mouth. Staring back to the reflection of himself, he saw that there was no longer anything there anymore.  
一股难以言喻的剧痛突然袭击了他的右肋。渐渐地，他的目光落在了肋骨与髋骨之间的位置。一把大刀嵌在这两者之间。突然间，刀被猛地拔出，大量鲜血随之涌出。他先前还能发出的声音，此刻却因一只手捂住了他的嘴而无法尖叫。回望镜中的自己，他发现那里已空无一物。

Hands began tugging at his body, pulling him down, and he sank into ocean beneath his feet. Underneath the water was crystal clear, with the sun still shinning brightly above him, and he was able to see his assailants. They were all faceless humanoid entities, but each one had a sharp weapon, or blunt instrument clasped in their hand. His body was still being tugged down deeper into the ocean, and he felt another emotion welling up inside him. He was fearful.  
双手开始拉扯他的身体，将他拽入脚下的大海。水下清澈见底，阳光依旧灿烂地照耀着他，他能看见袭击者们。他们都是无面的人形实体，但每人手中都紧握着锋利的武器或钝器。他的身体仍在被拖向海洋深处，一种新的情绪在他内心涌动。他感到恐惧。

He tossed and turned, contorting his body and trying to get away from the shapes that threatened him. They began assaulting him again though, bladed weapons tearing into his skin, ripping apart his flesh, while the blunt weapons cracked his bones. He wanted to scream, but he couldn't. His consciousness was slowly starting to fade. Without ever knowing who he was, what this place was, or what the many things his reflection had told...he was going to die here.  
他辗转反侧，扭曲身体试图逃离那些威胁他的形状。然而，它们再次开始攻击他，利刃撕裂他的皮肤，撕开他的肉体，而钝器则击碎他的骨头。他想尖叫，却发不出声。他的意识渐渐开始消散。在不了解自己是谁，这个地方是什么，或是他的倒影告诉了他多少事情的情况下...他即将在这里死去。

At that thought, something seemed to click inside of him. Death would be the ending of his existence. Whatever this world entailed, or whoever he was supposed to meet, if he died here, it wouldn't matter. He was afraid of the darkness that would come about after he died, but his fear of his assailants grew distant. He didn't care what it took, but he wanted to live. If he had to crawl across the ground and become something unlike any human before him, he would do so to survive. Whatever it took, or however many lives he destroyed along the way, he didn't care. He had to survive, not only for his own sake, but for her as well.  
想到这里，他内心似乎有什么被触动了。死亡将是他存在的终结。无论这个世界包含什么，或者他应该遇见谁，如果他死在这里，一切都不重要了。他害怕死后降临的黑暗，但他对袭击者的恐惧逐渐淡去。他不在乎需要付出什么代价，但他渴望活下去。如果他必须在地上爬行，变成前所未有的非人存在，他也会这么做以求生存。无论付出什么代价，或者沿途毁灭多少生命，他都不在乎。他必须活下去，不仅是为了自己，也是为了她。

Something exploded from within him, and the water was awash with the muted scream of these entities. He didn't think of them as humans, because they truly weren't. Scum of the earth, the lowest form of life possible, insects which he trampled over. Even so, blood spurted, bones crunched, limbs were torn asunder, and bodies were disemboweled. He felt it all, even though he didn't physical touch with any part of his body. But he didn't care. He would push through everything, and secure the future for which he longed for.  
某种力量从他体内爆发，水中充斥着这些生物的沉闷尖叫。他不认为他们是人类，因为他们确实不是。地上的渣滓，可能的最低等生命形式，他践踏的昆虫。即便如此，血液喷涌，骨头碎裂，四肢被撕裂，身体被开膛破肚。他感受到了这一切，尽管他没有身体上的接触。但他不在乎。他会克服一切，确保他渴望的未来。

Even insects can overwhelm the strongest of opponents however, and the teenager was slowly being worm down by the sheer numbers. Millions of them assaulted him, slashing at his body, while others tried to pull him down to the darkness. He was growing tired, and though he no longer felt their attacks, they were still affecting him. He would get close to the surface, and then they would redouble their attacks, and pull him back down. If he could only reach the surface and escape this darkness, he would be safe.  
即便是昆虫，也能压垮最强大的对手，而这位少年正逐渐被其庞大的数量所消耗。数百万只昆虫向他发起攻击，撕咬他的身体，其他则试图将他拖入黑暗。他越来越疲惫，尽管不再感受到它们的攻击，但这些影响依然存在。他接近水面时，它们会加倍攻击，将他拉回深渊。只要他能到达水面，逃离这片黑暗，就能安全了。

As he stared up to surface of the ocean, he saw a rush of bubbles, and a hand suddenly appearing under the surface. Fighting of his attackers, he gave one final push, swimming with all his might to the surface. The desperately attacked him, but he continued killing them, the ocean slowly changing from a bright blue, to a dark red. His mind didn't even register when he felt to long slashes at his thighs which ripped apart his muscles. He continued swimming towards his salvation.  
当他凝视着海面时，看到一串气泡急速上升，紧接着一只手突然从水面下伸出。他奋力抵抗攻击者，用尽全力向水面游去。它们疯狂地攻击他，但他继续杀戮，海洋从明亮的蓝色渐渐变为深红色。当他感到大腿被两道长长的划痕撕裂肌肉时，他的意识甚至没有反应过来。他继续向着救赎游去。

Giving one last lunge, he grasped the hand and felt reassurance in the warm palm. The hand softly squeezed his had, letting him know that everything was alright now, and pulled him up to the surface, freeing him from his chains, and guiding him to his future.  
他最后一次猛冲，抓住了那只手，在温暖的掌心中感到了安慰。那只手轻轻地握了握他的手，让他知道现在一切都好了，然后将他拉上水面，解开了他的枷锁，引领他走向未来。

Shinji awoke with a start and sat up, his bare chest glistening with sweat, even though it was fall now. He was breathing heavily, and shivered controllably. He had been dreaming, but it was already starting to slip away. He honestly wasn't even sure if he could call it a dream; it felt like too oddly like one of his visions, though he hadn't had for a long time now, and had honestly thought that those things had passed. Running his hands through his hair, he didn't even notice Asuka sitting beside him with a worried expression on her face.  
真嗣突然惊醒，坐了起来，尽管已是秋天，他赤裸的胸膛上仍布满了汗水。他呼吸急促，不由自主地颤抖着。他刚才在做梦，但梦境已经开始模糊。他甚至不确定自己能否称之为梦；感觉太奇怪了，更像是一个预知梦，虽然他已经很久没有做过这种梦了，而且真心以为那些事情已经过去了。他用手梳理着头发，甚至没有注意到明日香坐在他旁边，脸上带着担忧的表情。

"You alright Shinji?" she finally spoke.  
“你还好吗，真嗣？”她终于开口问道。

Glancing beside him, he hadn't noticed that she was awake.  
瞥了一眼身旁，他才发现她已经醒了。

"Yeah, sorry. Bad dream."  
“嗯，抱歉。做了个噩梦。”

"I think it was more than just a bad dream. I tried shaking you multiple times, but you just kept tossing and turning and mumbling incoherent things. It wasn't one of your visions, was it?"  
“我觉得不只是噩梦那么简单。我试着摇醒你好几次，但你一直在翻来覆去，嘴里还含糊不清地说着什么。这不是你的预知梦，对吧？”

"No," said Shinji, shaking his head. "It wasn't a vision, but neither was it an ordinary dream either. I don't know what to make of it, but most of it has already started to slip away."  
"不，" 真嗣摇着头说，"那不是幻觉，但也并非普通的梦。我不知道该如何理解它，但大部分内容已经开始逐渐淡忘了。"

"Do you want to talk about it?"  
"你想谈谈吗？"

"No, I wan't to forget about it," sighed Shinji.  
"不，我想忘记它，" 真嗣叹息道。"

Asuka felt a small smile appear on her lips, and then said, "I think I can help with that."  
明日香感到一丝微笑浮现在唇边，然后说道：“我想我能帮上忙。”

Shinji hadn't noticed at first, but Asuka was wearing a loose white shirt and panties, but no bra. He felt a reaction from his waist, and soon, they were kissing while tangled in their blankets, Shinji's hands beginning to crawl along her body. They had become much more intimate with each other, and waking up to do these sort of things had become normal, even if the same thing occurred before they went to sleep.  
真嗣起初并未察觉，但明日香穿着宽松的白衬衫和内裤，却没有戴胸罩。他感到腰部一阵反应，很快，他们就在毯子里缠绵亲吻，真嗣的手开始在她身上游走。他们变得比以前亲密多了，醒来后做这些事情已经成了常态，即使睡前也常常如此。

With both their bodies glistening with sweat now, Shinji rolled off Asuka, and then stood up, leaving the bed. Entering the bathroom, he wiped himself down, and then changed into something more suitable when he felt Asuka wrap her arms around him, pressing her body against his. Even though had just relieved him, he quickly felt himself growing hard, owing to her bare breasts pressing against his back. She hadn't wiped herself off, so she was still slick with sweat, but she seemed to have something else on her mind.  
两人身上都汗津津的，真嗣从明日香身上翻下来，然后站起身，离开了床。走进浴室，他擦干自己，换上更合适的衣服，这时明日香从背后抱住他，将身体紧贴着他。尽管刚刚才让他释放，但由于她赤裸的胸部紧贴着他的背部，他很快又感到自己硬了起来。她还没擦干自己，所以身上还是汗涔涔的，但她似乎在想着别的事情。

"How do you feel now?" asked Asuka.  
"现在感觉如何？" 明日香问道。

Shinji couldn't help but smile as he looked at the mirror, both his and Asuka's faces displayed there, hers resting against his shoulder.  
真嗣看着镜子，忍不住笑了，镜中映出他和明日香的脸，她的头靠在他的肩上。

"A lot better," he answered truthfully.  
"好多了，" 他如实回答。

Asuka gave a slight smirk, knowing that he wasn't just talking about the dream he had woken up to. Kissing him quickly on the cheek, she started wiping herself down, and changing into her own clothes. Shinji couldn't help but have his eyes glance over to her while he brushed his teeth. No matter how many times he got to kiss her, or touch her breasts, he always wanted more.  
明日香微微一笑，她知道他说的不仅仅是刚刚醒来的那个梦。她迅速在他脸颊上轻吻一下，然后开始擦拭身体，换上自己的衣服。真嗣刷牙时忍不住瞥向她。无论亲吻她多少次，或是触摸她的胸部，他总是渴望更多。

While Asuka finished dressing, Shinji went downstairs and started making a simple breakfast. Shinji and Asuka could only assume that with the changing of the season to fall, that roughly two years had passed since they had both woken up in Tokyo-3. In reality, it was October now, but neither of them knew this. Still, two years, and they had vastly matured, and had grown intimate with one another.  
当明日香换好衣服时，真嗣下楼开始准备简单的早餐。真嗣和明日香只能推测，随着季节转变为秋天，大约两年已经过去了，自从他们在东京-3 醒来。实际上，现在已经十月了，但他们并不知情。尽管如此，两年的时间，他们已经大大成熟，彼此之间也变得亲密无间。

While Shinji prepared dinner, he felt himself looking back on these two years, and everything that had happened between them. Some of it he had forgotten, and some of it he would always remember, but a long time had passed since he had met Asuka, at least, this is how he felt.  
真嗣准备晚餐时，他发现自己回想起这两年来的点点滴滴，以及他们之间发生的一切。有些事情他已经忘记，有些则会永远铭记，但自从遇见明日香以来，已经过去了很长时间，至少他是这么感觉的。

While waiting for the water to boil, he leaned back in his chair, looking up the sky above his head. The sky was blue, and he was briefly reminded of his dream. It was still fuzzy, but bits and pieces he could still remember, though not all of it. It unnerved him somehow though. He couldn't explain it, but he felt like he should take caution to whatever it had meant.  
在等待水烧开的时候，他靠在椅背上，抬头望着头顶的蓝天。天空是蓝色的，这让他短暂地想起了自己的梦。梦境依旧模糊，但有些片段他还能记得，尽管不是全部。不知为何，这让他有些不安。他说不清原因，但感觉自己应该对梦中的含义保持警惕。

"Nearly done?" came Asuka's voice as she opened the sliding door.  
“快好了吗？”明日香的声音从推拉门后传来。

"I've been sorta taking my time," shrugged Shinji.  
“我有点在慢慢来，”真嗣耸了耸肩。

"Then I suppose you wont mind if I do this," said Asuka as she sat down on Shinji's lap. Almost immediately, Asuka felt something poking against her butt. Well, at least one part of him was honest.  
"那么我想你不会介意我这么做，" 明日香说着坐在了真嗣的腿上。几乎立刻，明日香感觉到有什么东西顶着她的臀部。好吧，至少他的一部分是诚实的。

"Asuka, with you sitting here, it only makes it even more difficult to prepare breakfast."  
"明日香，你坐在这里，只会让准备早餐变得更困难。"

"So that means you don't like it?"  
"这么说你不喜欢？"

"...No...quite the opposite really," mumbled Shinji rather inaudibly.  
"...不...恰恰相反，真的。" 真嗣咕哝着，声音几乎听不见。

Asuka chuckled lightly at that, but did leave his lap, sitting on the chair beside him. No matter how close they became, Asuka still enjoyed teasing him occasionally, though Shinji was much better about coping with it. Though, not to mention that Asuka had her fair share of teasing as well, and by now, Shinji knew all the spots along her body to make her squirm. She was much better at controlling her desires than she used to be however, and she was no longer attached to a bottle, though she did still drink sometimes. In fact, the one time when Asuka and Shinji both got a bit tipsy together, they had spent nearly two hours wrapped in each other arms, and had only gone to sleep after the alcohol began wearing off. They had both been careful to not drink so much that they blacked out, so they both remembered that night.  
对此，明日香轻声笑了笑，但还是从他的腿上起身，坐到了他旁边的椅子上。尽管他们关系越来越亲密，明日香偶尔还是喜欢逗逗他，不过真嗣应对得已经好多了。不过，值得一提的是，明日香也有自己的一套逗弄方式，而如今，真嗣已经知道她身体上哪些地方能让她扭动。然而，她控制欲望的能力比以前强多了，也不再依赖酒瓶，尽管偶尔还是会喝点。事实上，有一次明日香和真嗣都喝得有点醉意，他们紧紧相拥了近两个小时，直到酒精开始消退才入睡。他们都很小心，没有喝到失去意识，所以都记得那个夜晚。

They chatted amiably with each other while waiting for breakfast to be done, but Asuka thought that Shinji seemed a bit preoccupied, and he would lose track of the conversation they were having. Whatever his dream was, it looked like it was still bothering him.  
他们一边等待早餐，一边愉快地聊着天，但明日香觉得真嗣似乎有些心不在焉，他会时不时跟不上他们的对话。看来，他的梦境还在困扰着他。

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka suddenly, cutting him off from what he just been saying.  
"嘿，真嗣？" 明日香突然问道，打断了他刚刚说的话。

"What?" "什么？"

"You sure you don't want to talk about that dream you had?"  
"你确定不想谈谈你做的那个梦吗？"

Shinji blinked once, before letting out a shrug, and then scratched the back of his head nervously.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，然后耸了耸肩，接着紧张地挠了挠后脑勺。

"I really can't hide anything from you, can I Asuka..."  
"我真是瞒不过你啊，明日香..."

"I've seen this same incident too many times to count now, so it's not surprising that I wouldn't recognize you're thinking deeply about something. Besides, if it's troubling you this much, then I think you should talk about it."  
"这种事我已经见过无数次了，所以不难看出你在深思熟虑。而且，如果这件事让你如此困扰，我觉得你应该说出来。"

Shinji looked back at her for several seconds, before glancing up to the blue sky above his head, eerily similar to the one from his dream, even though it was fall now.  
真嗣回头看了她几秒钟，然后抬头望向头顶的蓝天，与梦境中的景象惊人地相似，尽管现在已是秋天。

"You're right, as usual," Shinji finally said. "I don't know what to make of it is the problem though. I feel like there's something there which I need to understand, but I don't know what that is. Plus, I can only remember so much of it, which is like most dreams I suppose."  
“你总是对的，”真嗣终于说道，“问题是我不知道该如何理解它。我感觉那里有我需要理解的东西，但我不知道那是什么。而且，我只能记得其中的一部分，我想大多数梦境都是这样吧。”

With that said, Shinji started telling Asuka everything he could remember from the dream. The blue sky and blue ocean were the most distinct, and his own self which was walking into the distant horizon. He wasn't sure whether there was anything before this, but he felt like he had walked for a long while. Afterwards, things started to become fuzzy. He knew there was something important in the middle, and there was an outline of a face, but it wouldn't become clear. Then, he remembered sinking into the water, and hands trying to pull him down to the depths. Lastly, he remembered seeing in a hand submerged in the water from the surface, and how he desperately grabbed ahold of that hand, and then woke up.  
说完这些，真嗣开始向明日香讲述他能记得的梦境内容。最清晰的是那片蓝天和碧海，以及走向遥远地平线的自己。他不确信之前是否还有其他内容，但感觉自己似乎走了很久。之后，事情开始变得模糊。他知道中间有些重要的东西，有一张脸的轮廓，但就是无法清晰起来。然后，他记得自己沉入了水中，有双手试图将他拖向深渊。最后，他记得看到一只手从水面上沉下去，他拼命抓住那只手，然后就醒了。”

Asuka was silent after he had finished talking, thinking about what he said. She honestly wasn't sure what to make of it. It was to vague in the first place, but Asuka has to admit that she could see why Shinji was worried about it. There was something that felt ominous about it.  
碇真嗣说完后，明日香沉默了，思考着他所说的话。她真的不确定该如何理解。一开始就太过模糊，但明日香不得不承认，她能理解为什么真嗣会为此担忧。这件事总感觉有些不祥。

"Is that all you can remember about it?" Asked Asuka coming out of her thoughts.  
“你就只记得这些吗？”明日香从思绪中回过神来问道。

"Yeah," nodded Shinji. "I wish I knew what had happened in the middle. I have a vague understanding that I spoke to someone, or something, but I don't know what it was."  
“嗯，”真嗣点头道，“我希望我能记得中间发生了什么。我隐约记得我和某人或某物交谈过，但我不知道那是什么。”

The more he thought about it though, the more it reminded him about a vision he had had well over a year ago, his last vision, if his dream wasn't considered one. That one had been confusing as well, but they both shared similarities with the faceless entities. This time though, they were causing him harm. Were the two connected somehow?  
然而，他越是深思，就越发觉得这与一年多前他曾有过的一次预见相似，那也是他的最后一次预见，如果他的梦境不算在内的话。那次预见同样令人困惑，但两者都与那些无面实体有着相似之处。不过这次，它们正在对他造成伤害。这两者之间是否存在某种联系呢？

"Is it possible this is nothing but a bad dream you just had?" asked Asuka.  
“这会不会只是你刚刚做的一个噩梦？”明日香问道。

"Under normal circumstances, I might say yes, but I'm not normal either, so it's possible it was a vision. It isn't the first time this has happened, but this felt much more a like a dream."  
“在正常情况下，我可能会说是，但我也不正常，所以这可能是预见。这不是第一次发生，但这次感觉更像是一个梦。”

"What are you talking about?"  
"你在说什么呢？"

"I told you about it didn't I, about the dream I had after we moved into our old home in Tokyo-2?"  
"我不是告诉过你吗，关于我们搬进东京-2 的老家后我做的那个梦？"

"Did you? I guess I forgot."  
"是吗？我大概忘了。"

"Well, it was a dream, at least I think it was, but I talked with my self that can control an AT-field. I feel like like something similar happened with this dream, but I can't remember what it was."  
"嗯，那至少是个梦，我想是的，但我与能控制 AT 力场的自己交谈了。我感觉这个梦似曾相识，但就是记不清具体是什么了。"

"I guess I kinda remember you telling me about that, but it was also so long ago. What's your point though?"  
"我好像有点记得你跟我说过这事，但那也是很久以前了。不过，你想表达什么呢？"

Shinji didn't reply. He honestly wasn't even sure why this was bothering him so much. If he could only remember all the details, but dreams never worked like that.  
真嗣没有回答。他其实也不确定为什么这件事让他如此困扰。如果能记起所有细节就好了，但梦境从来都不是那样运作的。

"Are you still practicing?" asked Asuka.  
"你还在练习吗？" 明日香问道。

Shinji was surprised that she had brought this up. She obviously knew that he had been, but he had recently in the past few months stopped. He didn't know why, but he still couldn't control it exactly as he wished, and the ability to unconsciously use it without his right hand hadn't happened yet. However, the intimacy that he now had with Asuka was also something that had pushed everything else away. He still had to chop wood, but he found this as a chore, and after he was done, always came back home.  
真嗣对她的提及感到惊讶。她显然知道他一直在练习，但最近几个月他已经停止了。他不知道为什么，但他仍然无法完全按照自己的意愿控制它，而且无意识地不用右手使用它的能力还没有发生。然而，他现在与明日香之间的亲密关系也是将其他一切都推开的原因。他仍然需要砍柴，但他觉得这是一项苦差事，而且砍完后总是回家。

"No I'm not," said Shinji truthfully. "After I finish chopping wood, I always come back."  
"不，我没有，" 真嗣诚实地回答。"砍完柴后，我总是回家。"

Asuka watched him, worried that Shinji was thinking about this far too much. Slowly, she leaned close to him, and then rested her hand against his. Shinji looked over at her, recognizing the expression on her face as one of worry. The warmth from Asuka's hand slowly enveloped him,  
明日香注视着他，担心真嗣对此事考虑得太过深入。她缓缓地向他靠近，然后将手轻轻搭在他的手上。真嗣转头看向她，认出她脸上的表情是担忧。明日香手心的温暖渐渐包围了他，

reminding him that he wasn't alone in this. Grasping her hand tightly, he drew his face closer to her, placing his lips against hers.  
让他想起在这件事上他并不孤单。他紧紧握住她的手，将脸贴近她，将唇贴在她的唇上。

Shinji had intended it as a brief thing, but Asuka met his kiss in turn, returning it, and inserting her tongue into his mouth. They kissed like this deeply, until Asuka broke off suddenly and stood up. Her hand was still grasped in Shinji's, and she began steering him back inside the house, and then guided him to the couch, were the fell in each other's arms, continuing to kiss.  
真嗣本打算只是短暂的一吻，但明日香回应了他的吻，回吻着他，并将舌头伸入他的口中。他们深情地这样吻着，直到明日香突然停下来，站起身。她的手仍被真嗣握着，她开始引导他回到屋内，然后带他到沙发旁，两人相拥倒下，继续亲吻。

Shinji needed this right now, banishing the thoughts he had earlier into oblivion. He became enraptured with Asuka as he continued kissing her. His hands began exploring the body which he knew so well, but never got tired of. He began feeling something pressing against his jeans, and knew by the slight smirk on Asuka's lips that she knew this as well.  
真嗣此刻正需要这个，将之前的思绪抛诸脑后。他继续亲吻着明日香，完全沉浸其中。他的双手开始探索那具他再熟悉不过的身体，却从未感到厌倦。他感觉到有什么东西抵在了他的牛仔裤上，从明日香嘴角微微的笑意中，他知道她也察觉到了。

**(A/N: Follow page or two contains sexual content, but no actual intercourse. Summary at next bold lettering.)  
(注：接下来几页包含性内容，但没有实际性行为。详情见下文粗体字部分。)**

With her laying on top of him, she slowly sat up on his waist, and then removed her shirt, revealing the white bra underneath. As she went to undo the clasp at her back though, Shinji sat up and wrapped his arms around her back. Pushing her hands to the side, he himself undid the clasp, forcing the bra to fall from her chest, her breasts spilling out in front of him. Asuka was surprised at his sudden daring, but she had little time to think about this, as she let out a small moan when Shinji's hands enveloped her breasts.  
她躺在他身上，缓缓地坐在他的腰间，然后脱掉了上衣，露出下面的白色胸罩。正当她准备解开背后的扣子时，真嗣坐了起来，双臂环抱住她的后背。他将她的手推到一旁，亲自解开了扣子，胸罩随之从她胸前滑落，双峰展现在他眼前。明日香对他的突然大胆感到惊讶，但还没来得及多想，真嗣的双手已覆上她的乳房，让她不禁轻声呻吟。

As he had done many times before this, he began massaging them, pinching Asuka's erect nipples, and wrapping his lips around them. He knew all of Asuka's weak points, and where and when to prod them. Her body squirmed with pleasure, and he wondered whether she was near her climax. His own erection was pressing against his jeans so painfully, that he thought might rupture.  
像往常一样，他开始按摩它们，捏住明日香的挺立乳头，并用嘴唇包裹住它们。他熟知明日香的所有弱点，知道何时何地该触碰。她的身体因快感而扭动，他不禁猜测她是否即将达到高潮。自己的勃起正痛苦地顶着牛仔裤，他甚至担心会因此破裂。

Asuka had become more resilient to his attacks however after months of this, and she fought back. Pressing her hands against his chest, she pushed him onto his back, and Shinji was forced to relinquish his grip on Asuka's breasts. Asuka began grinding against his waist, and this time it was Shinji's turn to let out a small groan. She did something unexpected however, and started fumbling at the button fastening his jeans to his waist. This was way beyond Shinji's expectations, and he was about to voice his complainants, when Asuka unbuttoned his pants, and slid them halfway down his thigh. Predictably, his erection sprang up immediately, threatening to break free of his boxers.  
然而，经过几个月的磨练，明日香对这种攻击变得更加坚韧，并开始反击。她用手按住他的胸膛，将他推倒，迫使真嗣松开了对明日香胸部的掌握。明日香开始在他的腰间磨蹭，这次轮到真嗣发出轻微的呻吟。但随后她做出了一个出乎意料的举动，开始摸索着解开他牛仔裤的扣子。这完全超出了真嗣的预期，正当他准备表达不满时，明日香解开了他的裤子，将其拉到一半，露出了他的大腿。不出所料，他的勃起立刻弹了出来，似乎要挣脱内裤的束缚。

Asuka grew hesitant however. She was just going with the normal motions, and her own emotions, but she felt an odd sensation in her stomach as she stared at the object pressing against Shinji's boxers. She was exited, but she want sure what she wanted to do now. Had she gone to far with this? Should she just stop? Did she want to in the first place?  
然而，明日香开始犹豫了。她只是按照平常的动作和自己的情绪行事，但当她盯着顶在真嗣内裤上的物体时，她感到一种奇怪的感觉在胃里翻腾。她兴奋，但又不太确定自己现在想做什么。她是不是做得太过火了？应该就此打住吗？她一开始就真的想这么做吗？

"Asuka?" asked Shinji, wondering what she was thinking about it.  
“明日香？”真嗣问道，想知道她在想什么。

Asuka didn't look at him, but slowly started repositioning herself. Lifting herself up, she moved over Shinji's waist, and sank down, pressing her hips against his. Shinji's expression immediacy changed from confusion to bliss. Asuka didn't noticed though, focused on what she was doing. She started moving her hips back and forth against Shinji's waist. She had done this many times before, but that was when Shinji was wearing jeans. She could feel his thing pressing against the spot between her legs. She could almost feel it pulsating, and felt her underwear start to grow slicker.  
明日香没有看他，而是慢慢地开始调整自己的位置。她抬起身子，跨过真嗣的腰，然后沉下身，将臀部紧贴着他的。真嗣的表情立刻从困惑变成了愉悦。但明日香没有注意到，她专注于自己的动作。她开始前后移动臀部，摩擦着真嗣的腰。她以前做过很多次，但那时真嗣穿着牛仔裤。她能感觉到他的那个东西顶在双腿之间的位置。她几乎能感觉到它在跳动，感觉到自己的内裤开始变得湿润。

Asuka knew how dangerous this was, but felt she no longer cared. While she was feeling good, and she knew that Shinji was as well, she wanted more.  
明日香知道这有多危险，但她觉得她已经不在乎了。当她感觉良好，并且知道真嗣也一样时，她想要更多。

Asuka stopped suddenly, which displeased Shinji, since he had almost been there. She stood up however, and for a moment, Shinji thought that Asuka had reached her limit and was done. She began unbuttoning her pants however, and Shinji could help but stutter at that. In a few moments, Asuka was standing in front of him, bare breasted, in nothing but her white underwear. Shinji wasn't sure where he should look, and he couldn't help but feel a faint blush spread across his cheeks. Asuka herself was blushing, but she seemed firm in her decision. Once again, she climbed on Shinji's waist, and mounted him.  
明日香突然停了下来，这让真嗣有些不悦，因为他差点就达到了。然而，她站了起来，有那么一刻，真嗣以为明日香已经到了极限，准备结束。但她开始解开裤子的扣子，真嗣不禁结巴起来。片刻之间，明日香站在他面前，赤裸上身，只穿着白色的内衣。真嗣不确定该往哪里看，他忍不住感到脸颊微微泛红。明日香自己也在脸红，但她似乎坚定了自己的决定。她再次爬上真嗣的腰间，跨坐在他身上。

Everything prior to this had been incredible, but Shinji like this was they first time he felt real pleasure. Try as he might, he wasn't able to hold himself together, and as Asuka started moving her hips against his groin, any thought of denying her left his brain. His body started thrusting on its own, his hips pressing against her hips, and her privates pressing against his. The softness of her flesh was unbelievable as it pressed against him, and Shinji felt himself reaching the end.  
在此之前的一切都令人难以置信，但像这样与真嗣在一起，是他第一次感受到真正的快乐。尽管他尽力克制，却无法保持镇定，当明日香开始用她的臀部摩擦他的胯部时，任何拒绝她的念头都从他的脑海中消失了。他的身体开始自发地挺动，臀部紧贴着她的臀部，她的私密处紧压着他的。她肉体的柔软程度令人难以置信，当它紧贴着他时，真嗣感到自己即将达到高潮。

Asuka had difficulty keeping herself sane when Shinji started moving as well. Her whole body was nearly convulsing as her flesh wrapped around his. She had no idea this could feel so good, and this was only a taste of what it would truly feel like. Asuka wasn't sure whether her body could handle it. She had heard that the first time always hurt, but this was the complete opposite of that. If this was just what pressing each other's bodies together felt like, she wondered what the real thing would feel like.  
当真嗣也开始动起来时，明日香几乎难以保持理智。她的整个身体几乎在抽搐，她的肉体紧紧包裹着他。她不知道这感觉能如此美妙，而这只是真正感觉的一丝滋味。明日香不确定自己的身体是否能承受得住。她听说过第一次总是会痛，但这完全相反。如果仅仅是身体相贴就能有这种感觉，她不禁好奇真正的事情会是什么感觉。

Asuka was quickly sidetracked however, when Shinji sat up, wrapped his arms around her, and kissed her roughly, nearly smashing his lips against hers. Asuka wholeheartedly welcomed this kiss, and kissed him back ferociously, entwining her tongue with his. Both their bodies were sweating, and Asuka's underwear in particular was so wet that it was staining Shinji's boxers. The feel of his erection rubbing against her soft flesh was sending Asuka into a downward spiral of ecstasy and pleasure.  
然而，当真嗣坐起身，双臂环抱住明日香，粗暴地吻她，几乎将嘴唇撞在一起时，明日香很快就被转移了注意力。她全心全意地接受了这一吻，并凶猛地回吻他，舌头与他紧紧缠绕。两人的身体都在出汗，尤其是明日香的内裤湿得厉害，沾湿了真嗣的平角裤。他的勃起摩擦着她柔软的肌肤，让明日香陷入了一阵狂喜和快感的漩涡。

Both could feel everything welling up inside of them however, and Asuka felt herself reaching her climax. She held herself back though, not wanting this to end just yet. Shinji started attacking her breasts again though as they kissed, pinching her erect nipples, and Asuka arched her back suddenly, her body grinding against his, as her whole body jerked, reaching her climax. This was far too much for Shinji though, and before he knew what was happening, he too reach the end, his body giving one final thrust against Asuka's, before he collapsed on top of her.  
然而，两人都能感觉到内心的涌动，明日香感到自己即将达到高潮。但她克制住了，不想就这样结束。然而，真嗣在接吻时又开始攻击她的乳房，捏住她挺立的乳头，明日香突然弓起背，身体紧贴着他摩擦，全身一震，达到了高潮。这对真嗣来说太过强烈，还没等他反应过来，他也到达了终点，身体最后一次顶撞明日香，然后瘫倒在她身上。

**(A/N: Not much different in this than previous warning in chapter before this. Main change is they both strip down to there underwear, and grind against each other until they both climax.)  
(A/N: 与上一章的警告相比，这一章并无太大差异。主要变化是他们俩都脱到只剩内衣，然后互相摩擦直到高潮。)**

Both were panting heavily, their faces red, and their bodies slick with sweat, not to mention the state of both their underwear. Asuka felt like her whole head spinning; she had never felt like this before. Whatever she had ever possibly imagined was far beyond compare to what had just happened. She didn't want to move, and could still feel Shinji's thing pressing against her, but she also felt uncomfortable about how moist she was down there.  
两人都喘着粗气，脸颊通红，浑身是汗，更不用说他们的内衣状态了。明日香感觉自己的头在旋转；她从未有过这样的感觉。无论她曾经想象过什么，都远不及刚刚发生的事情。她不想动，仍能感觉到真嗣的东西压着她，但她同时也感到下身湿漉漉的不舒服。

"Hey Shinji?" she asked. “嘿，真嗣？”她问道。

Shinji gave a low grunt, showing that he was listening to her, but in mood to communicate right now. He was laying on top of her, his head snuggled between her breasts, and didn't seem to want to move.  
真嗣低声咕哝了一下，表明他在听她说话，但目前没有交流的兴致。他躺在她身上，头埋在她的双峰之间，似乎并不想动。

"Is it all right if I get up?" Asuka asked.  
“我可以起来吗？”明日香问道。

"...I want to continue laying like this," he replied lazily.  
“……我想继续这样躺着，”他懒洋洋地回答。

Asuka felt a small smile appear on her hips, and then wrapped her arms around his head, holding him tenderly against her.  
明日香感到一丝微笑浮现在她的唇边，随后她张开双臂环绕住他的头，温柔地拥他入怀。

"Okay, if that's what you want."  
“好吧，如果你想要那样。”

But as Asuka continued laying there holding Shinji against her body, she heard him start breathing heavily, and realized that he had fallen asleep.  
但当明日香继续躺在那里，紧紧抱着真嗣贴在自己身上时，她听到他的呼吸变得沉重，意识到他已经睡着了。

"Really, sometimes he is just too carefree," mumbled Asuka with a loving smile. Well, at least this way he wasn't worrying about that dream anymore. Asuka could at least remain here with him while he slept peacefully.  
“真的，有时候他真是太无忧无虑了。”明日香带着宠溺的微笑喃喃自语。好吧，至少这样一来，他不再为那个梦烦恼了。明日香至少可以留在这里，陪着他安然入睡。

Kissing him once on his forehead, Asuka leaned back on the couch, staring at the ceiling, and began slowly reminiscing all the times they had shares together until now.  
明日香在他的额头上轻轻一吻，然后靠回沙发上，凝视着天花板，开始慢慢回忆起他们至今共同度过的所有时光。

---

Shinji dreamed once again, but it wasn't something hurtful or unpleasant; he was making love to Asuka. As dreams were want to do however, his dream began change. The bed they were laying on disappeared, the feel of his body pressing against Asuka's disappeared, and the taste of her lips disappeared. What had happened moments ago, now disappeared from his memory, replaced by darkness all around him. The darkness began to melt away however, and was replaced by a grey sky. Buildings began springing up all around him, and he slowly began to recognize the landscape, even if he had only stayed in the city a short while before its destruction. It was Tokyo-3.  
真嗣再次梦见了，但这次并不是什么痛苦或不愉快的事情；他在梦中与明日香缠绵。然而，正如梦境常有的那样，他的梦开始发生变化。他们躺着的床消失了，身体紧贴的感觉消失了，她唇间的味道也消失了。片刻前发生的一切，如今从他的记忆中消失，取而代之的是四周的黑暗。然而，黑暗开始消融，被一片灰暗的天空所取代。建筑物开始在他周围涌现，他渐渐开始认出这片景象，尽管他只在城市被毁前短暂停留过。这里是第三新东京市。

As his initial confusion wore off, Shinji began walking around the city. It was exactly as he remembered it, with a few minor details which his mind conjured up on the fly. As time passed though, he realized that the entire city was devoid of other humans. What had once been a bustling city, the busiest in Japan, had now become a ghost town. Where was everybody? Where had they gone? Why did he feel so lonely?  
随着最初的困惑逐渐消散，真嗣开始在城市中漫步。一切都如他记忆中的模样，只是脑海中迅速浮现出一些细微的变化。然而，随着时间的推移，他意识到整个城市空无一人。曾经是日本最繁忙的城市，如今却变成了一座鬼城。大家都去哪儿了？他们去了哪里？为什么他感到如此孤独？

He ascended a hill, walking up the length of asphalt. When he reached the top, he saw a figure in the distance. He squinted his eyes, trying to distinguish the outline of the face. He thought he saw a smile appear briefly, but then the figure disappeared into a side alley. Shinji didn't know who this person was, or why they had smiled at him in such a friendly manner, but he decided to give chase.  
他爬上一座小山，沿着沥青路面向上走。到达山顶时，他看到远处有一个人影。他眯起眼睛，试图辨认出那人的轮廓。他以为自己看到了一个短暂的微笑，但随后那个人影消失在一条侧巷中。真嗣不知道这个人是谁，也不知道他们为何会以如此友好的方式对他微笑，但他决定追上去。

Racing down the alleyway where he had seen them disappear into, he saw the person standing at the other end waving at him. Shinji started to open his mouth to speak to them, but they disappeared from his sight again, hooking a right onto the street. Closing his mouth and forcing himself forward, he ran down the alleyway, and then turned right as they had.  
他冲进那人消失的巷子，看到他们在巷子另一端向他挥手。真嗣正要开口说话，但他们再次从他视线中消失，向右拐进了街道。他闭上嘴，强迫自己向前跑去，穿过巷子，然后像他们一样向右转。

As Shinji came around the corner though, he stopped in his tracks. He was back at the bottom of the hill, and the figure was standing above him in the same position they had initially been, the same smile on their face. Shinji couldn't help but grimace inwardly, feeling like this person was toying with him. Steeling himself, he jumped off the ground at a sprint, just as the person disappeared from his view once again.  
然而，当真嗣转过拐角时，他猛地停下了脚步。他又回到了山脚下，那个身影依旧站在他上方，保持着最初的姿态，脸上挂着同样的微笑。真嗣不禁暗自皱眉，感觉这个人像是在戏弄他。他鼓起勇气，猛地从地上跃起，全速冲刺，但那人又一次从他的视线中消失了。

Shinji had no idea how many iterations of this transpired, but he was caught in an endless loop. Even if he turned left at the end of the alleyway, he returned to the hill. If he turned around while facing the hill, he would simply be facing it again. If he tried running backwards through the alleyway, he was standing on top of the hill, and the figure would be at the bottom, waving at him. After so many times of this happening, Shinji gave up, and sat down in the middle of the road facing the hill.  
真嗣不知道这种情况重复了多少次，但他陷入了无尽的循环。即使他在小巷尽头向左转，也会回到山脚下。如果他面对山丘转身，他会再次面对它。如果他试图倒退着穿过小巷，他会站在山顶上，而那个身影会在山脚下向他挥手。经历了这么多次之后，真嗣放弃了，坐在路中央，面对着山丘。

Staring up at the hill, he watched the smile disappear from the persons face briefly, but then reappear with a slight smirk, disappearing into the alleyway. After many moments passed where it became apparent that Shinji wouldn't follow, the person reappeared. A frown was now plastered on their face, not pleased with Shinji's unwillingness to give chase. They sat down, hoping that he would find new resolve, but still, Shinji didn't move. If all they did was run away, then it was altogether pointless to give chase.  
他抬头望着山坡，看到那人的笑容短暂消失，随即又带着一丝讥笑重新浮现，消失在巷子里。过了许久，显然真嗣没有追上来，那人又出现了。此刻他们的脸上满是皱眉，对真嗣不愿追赶感到不满。他们坐了下来，希望真嗣能重拾决心，但真嗣依旧一动不动。如果他们只是逃跑，那么追赶就毫无意义了。

When Shinji was wishing this farce would just end however, the figure began walking down the hill towards him. Shinji didn't budge, thinking that if he made any sudden movements they'd run from him again. Slowly, the face of the person came into view, but Shinji could honestly say he had no idea who they were. But something inside of him, something he couldn't place, felt familiar to him. The person was human in form, but neither gender could Shinji attribute to them. They were an enigma to him.  
当真嗣希望这场闹剧快点结束时，那身影却开始从山坡上向他走来。真嗣没有动，心想如果自己有任何突然的动作，他们又会逃离。渐渐地，那人的面容清晰起来，但真嗣实在认不出是谁。但内心深处，某种他无法言明的感觉，却让他觉得熟悉。那人形似人类，但真嗣无法判断其性别。对他来说，他们是个谜。

The person, male or female, sat down beside him though, and let a high voice reminiscent of that of a female, so Shinji decide to refer to this person as 'her' instead of 'it.' However, he was still nervous about scaring her away, so he kept his mouth closed in the meantime.  
那个人，无论男女，坐在了他旁边，用一种高亢的声音，让人联想到女性的嗓音，因此真嗣决定称这位为‘她’而非‘它’。然而，他仍担心会吓跑她，所以暂时保持沉默。

"Ah, I haven't had that much fun in a while. You have no idea how boring things can get here."  
“啊，我已经很久没有这么开心过了。你不知道这里有多无聊。”

She seemed to be expecting him to say something to her, but still Shinji didn't speak. She frowned at him, and then said, "What, did you not enjoy that? You really know how to ruin the fun out of things...Shinji."  
她似乎期待着他说些什么，但真嗣依旧沉默。她对他皱了皱眉，然后说道：“怎么，你不喜欢吗？你真是懂得如何破坏气氛……真嗣。”

Shinji's eyes wavered to her at the sound of his own name. He had sorta been expecting this, but it didn't make any easier to swallow.  
听到自己的名字，真嗣的目光不由得转向她。他多少预料到了这一刻，但并未因此感到轻松半分。

"Go on. Talk to me. I won't bite. Ask me anything you want and I'll do my best to answer it."  
“继续，跟我聊聊。我不会咬人的。你想问什么就问吧，我会尽力回答。”

"...Okay, then who are you I suppose would be my first question?"  
“……好吧，那我想我的第一个问题是，你是谁？”

"Hmm, well unfortunately, I can't answer that, and you wouldn't believe me anyway. Next."  
"嗯，很遗憾，我无法回答那个问题，而且无论如何你也不会相信我的。下一个。"

"Then what is this place?"  
"那么，这是什么地方？"

"Only you would know that Shinji. What is this place to you?"  
"只有你会知道，真嗣。这个地方对你来说意味着什么？"

"Tokyo-3, or as I remember it from before Third Impact."  
"东京-3，或者如我在第三次冲击前所记得的那样。"

"Third Impact huh," she mumbled, seeming lost in her own thoughts.  
"第三次冲击啊，"她喃喃自语，似乎陷入了自己的思绪中。"

Shinji watched her for several seconds, wondering why this person felt so familiar to him, but her next question confused him.  
真嗣注视了她几秒钟，想知道为什么这个人让他感觉如此熟悉，但她的下一个问题却让他困惑。

"Shinji, do you ever think about what happened in the past, or what's happening in the present, or what may or may not happen in the future?"  
"真嗣，你会不会思考过去发生了什么，现在正在发生什么，或者未来可能或不可能发生的事情？"

Shinji wasn't sure how to reply to this. The past was the past, and while he may cherish things from the past, it has already passed, and so he moved on. The present was what he thought about the most, the here and now which affected him. The future was something he tried not to dwell on. Nobody could predict the future, not with one hundred percent accuracy at least. You could try and prepare for it, but fate had a way of sending you curve balls so that it was difficult to react to.  
真嗣不确定该如何回答这个问题。过去已经过去，尽管他可能会珍视过去的某些事物，但它已经消逝，所以他继续前行。他最常思考的是现在，即此刻，这直接影响着他。至于未来，他尽量不去深究。没有人能百分百准确地预测未来。你可以尝试为之准备，但命运总有办法给你出其不意的打击，让你难以应对。

"Well, I kinda see where you're coming from, but you should think about the future more," she said as though she has read Shinji's mind.  
"嗯，我大概明白你的想法，但你还是应该多考虑一下未来，" 她仿佛读懂了真嗣的心思般说道。

"But you can't predict it, so why bothering worrying about it?"  
"但你无法预知未来，何必为此烦恼呢？"

"It's not just you though that will be affected by the future, but her as well. What about Asuka?"  
"不只是你会受未来影响，她也会。那明日香呢？"

As she said this, Shinji remembered what had been happening before he had been thrust into this strange world. He had forgotten about her, and he felt ashamed because of this. Asuka was to him, as Eve was to Adam, an existence impossible to separate himself from.  
当她说这话时，真嗣想起了被卷入这个奇异世界之前发生的事。他忘记了她，为此感到羞愧。对真嗣而言，明日香就像亚当的夏娃，是一个无法割舍的存在。

"See, you have to think about the future that doesn't just affect yourself, but the whole picture. What sort of future do you want for yourself and Asuka? Do you believe you can continue living as you are. How long did it take for the food to run out in the first store? How far will you have to start driving when the next place is no longer possible. What if something happens to Asuka and you aren't there? You're right, the future isn't one hundred percent accurate, even for yourself, but you can certainly prepare for it."  
"你看，你得考虑一个不仅影响你自己，还关乎全局的未来。你想要为自己和明日香创造什么样的未来？你认为你能继续像现在这样生活下去吗？第一次商店的食物耗尽花了多长时间？当下一个地方不再可行时，你得开多远的车？如果明日香出了什么事而你不在她身边怎么办？你说得对，未来并非百分百准确，即使是对你自己而言，但你绝对可以为此做好准备。"

"I don't know what you mean by that though. What am I preparing for?"  
"我不明白你说的准备是什么意思。我到底在准备什么？"

She looked at him rather sadly at first as though she pitied him, but then said, "I think you may in a far back corner of your mind already know Shinji, even if you try to reject it. But I've already said far too much on the subject. So I think it's about time you woke up."  
她起初悲伤地看着他，仿佛在怜悯他，然后说道：“我想你内心深处可能已经知道了，真嗣，即使你试图否认。但我已经在这个话题上说得太多。所以我想是时候你该醒醒了。”

Shinji did just that, and felt the dream beginning to dissolve around him, even though he was the first to disappear as he woke up. The woman, if that's truly what she was, continued sitting in the middle of the road as the buildings began to vanish around her. There was only so much she could do for them before things were forced to work as they would. Time would be a very precious thing for them as they would eventually realize.  
碇真嗣确实这么做了，感觉到梦境开始在他周围消散，尽管他是第一个在醒来时消失的。那个女人，如果她真的是个女人的话，继续坐在路中央，周围的建筑开始消失。在他们被迫接受事物本来的运作方式之前，她能做的只有这么多。对他们来说，时间将是一种非常宝贵的东西，他们最终会意识到这一点。

As the world continued disappearing around her, she too disappeared, vanishing into the deep confines of Shinji's conscience.  
随着世界在她周围继续消失，她也消失了，消失在碇真嗣意识的深处。

---

When Shinji woke up, he at first thought he was still dreaming. The darkness around him was so deep that it took his eyes a moment to adjust, but this was normal for somehow just waking up as well in pitch blackness.  
当碇真嗣醒来时，他起初以为自己还在做梦。周围的黑暗如此深沉，以至于他的眼睛需要片刻来适应，但对于刚刚在漆黑中醒来的人来说，这也是正常的。

He was still laying on the couch, but his head was resting on a pillow. Sitting up he glanced around the living room, before spotting a shirt, jeans, and underwear that had been left there for him. He then remembered what had transpired between himself and Asuka, wondering how he could have slept until it was dark out. Stripping himself down, he changed into the fresh clothes right there in the living room, and then went in search of Asuka. One quick glance around the kitchen showed that she wasn't there, or outside, so he assumed that she was upstairs.  
他依旧躺在沙发上，头枕着一个枕头。坐起身来，他环顾了一下客厅，随即发现了一套为他准备的衬衫、牛仔裤和内裤。这时，他记起了与明日香之间发生的事情，疑惑自己怎会一觉睡到天黑。他脱下身上的衣物，就在客厅里换上了干净的衣服，然后开始寻找明日香。匆匆扫视厨房一圈，发现她不在那里，也不在户外，于是他推测她应该在楼上。

He found her as he expected, laying in bed, and reading by candlelight. When Asuka saw him she put down the book, smirking slightly at him.  
正如他所料，他找到了她，她正躺在床上，借着烛光阅读。明日香看到他时，放下书本，微微对他露出了一丝笑意。

"Sleep long enough? Did you recuperate?"  
“睡够了？恢复得怎么样？”

Shinji felt himself blush lightly at that remark, knowing what she meant.  
听到那句话，真嗣感觉自己的脸微微泛红，他明白她的意思。

"What have you been doing this whole time?"  
“这段时间你都在做什么？”

"Not much. Lazing around the house, reading, cooked dinner for myself, though there is still some left if you want it cold. Oh, and keeping an eye on you."  
“没做什么。在家闲晃，看看书，给自己做了晚饭，不过还剩一些，如果你想吃冷的话。哦，还有，一直在关注你。”

"Keeping an eye on me?" asked Shinji, puzzled.  
“在监视我吗？”真嗣疑惑地问道。

"You had another dream, didn't you?"  
“你又做梦了，对吧？”

Shinji didn't say anything; Asuka could just read him to well. Not having any reason to not tell her though, Shinji began speaking. This dream was much clearer than the one he has woken up to, so he was able to tell Asuka in great detail about it, though he left out the early part of his dream. Asuka even laughed lightly when he talked about chasing this strange person, but she grew quite as he reached the end. When he finished, she was frowning slightly.  
真嗣没有说话；明日香对他了解得太透彻了。不过，既然没有理由不告诉她，真嗣便开始讲述。这个梦比他醒来时的那个清晰得多，所以他能够详细地向明日香描述，尽管他省略了梦的前半部分。当他说到追逐那个奇怪的人时，明日香甚至轻声笑了起来，但当他讲到结尾时，她变得沉默了。当他讲完后，她微微皱起了眉头。

"And you put stock in this?" asked Asuka.  
"你就这么相信这个？" 明日香问道。

"I don't know, it's something to think about. Besides Asuka, what should our future be? We haven't talked about it since we've been here, and two years have passed since we woke up in Tokyo-3. Can we realistically continue living here in the first place?"  
"我不确定，但这是个值得思考的问题。再说明日香，我们的未来应该是什么样的？自从我们来到这里，就再也没有讨论过这个问题，而我们醒来已经两年了。我们真的能继续在这里生活下去吗？"

"This is our home, we can't just leave."  
"这里是我们的家，我们不能就这样离开。"

"The house in Tokyo-2 was our home as well, but we left there."  
"东京-2 的那栋房子也是我们的家，但我们离开了那里。"

"That was different, and we've been here for more than just two months Can you really just pick up everything and move our lives once again, or ever few years?"  
"那不一样，我们在这里已经不止两个月了。你真的能再次收拾一切，再次搬动我们的生活，或者每隔几年就这样吗？"

"No, I don't think I could," said Shinji truthfully.  
""不，我想我做不到，"" 真嗣诚实地回答。

"Then why bother bringing it up?"  
"那为什么还要提起呢？"

Shinji didn't say anything. In reality, he wasn't talking about moving to another house, but something else which could drastically change their lives. They were in this together, and Shinji wasn't going to let anything happen to Asuka, who he loved.  
真嗣没有说话。实际上，他说的不是搬到另一个房子，而是其他可能彻底改变他们生活的事情。他们是一起的，真嗣不会让任何事情发生在他们所爱的明日香身上。

"Now if you're done with the dumb questions, I'm going to bed. I stayed up waiting for you, but am now tired."  
"既然你无聊的问题问完了，我要去睡觉了。我熬夜等你，但现在累了。"

Shinji didn't think Asuka was mad at him, but annoyed instead. Shinji watched her adjust herself, and then lay down on the pillow. Shinji wasn't tired yet, so he left the room, wondering what he actually wanted with Asuka.  
真嗣不认为明日香在生他的气，只是有些烦躁。他看着她调整姿势，然后躺在了枕头上。真嗣还不困，于是他离开了房间，心里琢磨着自己到底对明日香有什么想法。

Asuka didn't immediately go to sleep though, and lay for a while with her face pressed against the pillow. The future: it was something that she tried not to think about. She had no misconception that her and Shinji would ever grow apart, but their were certain things that troubled her, entirely different from Shinji's own worries. She wanted to stay here with him though, and did not want to move. She has grown too accustomed with this place to want to leave it. Not to mention, her feelings for Shinji had been made whole while living in this house, even if she didn't voice them.  
然而，明日香并没有立刻入睡，而是脸贴着枕头躺了一会儿。未来：这是她尽量不去想的事情。她并不认为她和真嗣会渐行渐远，但有些事情困扰着她，与真嗣的担忧完全不同。尽管如此，她想留在这里和他在一起，不想搬走。她已经习惯了这个地方，不想离开。更不用说，住在这所房子里，她对真嗣的感情变得更加完整，即使她没有说出口。

'What do I want?' wondered Asuka. In a far corner of her heart, she thought she knew the answer, but things were too soon.  
“我想要什么？”明日香心想。在她内心深处的一个角落，她觉得自己知道答案，但一切还为时过早。

Rolling onto her back, she did her best to fall asleep, while not trying to think about the possible futures which awaited them.  
她翻身仰躺，尽力让自己入睡，同时不去想那些可能等待着他们的未来。

---

Shinji didn't know how it had happened or what drove him to make such a decision in the first place, but he was weaving between the stumps of trees as he drove towards the latest group of trees he had started felling. Why he had decided to practice in the dead of night without any sort of light source, even a flashlight, he didn't know. The more he thought about the future though, the more he began to dwell on the possibilities. In particular, the vision he had just after they moved into their house. Some things he had seen had already happened, while other may not, or ever would. But, the words he had been told about preparation came back to him.  
真嗣不知道这一切是如何发生的，也不知道最初是什么驱使他做出这样的决定，但他正穿梭在树桩之间，驾车前往他最近开始砍伐的一片树木。他不知道为什么会选择在深夜练习，没有任何光源，甚至连手电筒也不用。然而，他越是思考未来，就越开始沉思各种可能性。特别是他们搬进新家后不久他做的一个梦。有些事情已经发生了，而其他的可能不会发生，或者永远不会。但是，关于准备的那番话又浮现在他的脑海中。

Stepping out of truck, he looked up into the clearing he had made. The moon was thankfully shining down right now, but this bright light may not last long. He had never done this while it was dark out, so he was feeling slightly apprehension.  
他走出卡车，抬头望向自己开辟的空地。幸好月亮此刻正照耀着，但这明亮的月光可能不会持续太久。他从未在黑暗中做过这件事，所以感到一丝不安。

'Well, may as well get started,' thought Shinji, and moments later, he projected his AT-field with a swing of his hand. It felt somehow refreshing to be doing this again, though he couldn't explain why.  
'好吧，还是开始吧，' 真嗣心想，随即挥手展开了他的 AT 力场。再次做这件事感觉有些神清气爽，尽管他说不出为什么。

He began pushing himself further as he fell back into the familiar motions. It was a simple thing now for him to move through the air as he controlled his AT-field, using it as a springboard. He even stared enjoying the feel of the cool air rushing against his face as he traveled through the air, his body silhouetted in the night sky thanks to the moons light. He was really just becoming familiar with this again, and knew that nothing substantial would come out of tonight, but it was a start. However long it would take him, he would become as proficient with his AT-field as he possibly could.  
他开始更加努力地推动自己，重新适应那些熟悉的动作。现在对他来说，利用 AT 力场作为跳板在空中移动已经变得轻而易举。他甚至开始享受起穿越空中时迎面而来的凉爽空气，月光下他的身影在夜空中显得格外清晰。他正在重新熟悉这一切，知道今晚不会有什么实质性的成果，但这是一个开始。无论需要多长时间，他都会尽可能熟练地掌握自己的 AT 力场。

Taking a brief break, he leaned against his trucks tailgate, a bottle of water beside him that had been left inside the cab. He felt far better now that he was actually doing something, but there was the problem with Asuka. He didn't want to worry her about his own thoughts on the future, or what could happen, but there was still the matter of where they stood. They had come close multiple times to participating in the act, but there were still things that hadn't been said. Before that could happen, Shinji wanted any problems cleared up between them, even if they both knew how the other felt. Still, Shinji wanted to hear those three words from Asuka own lips, no matter how long it would take her to utter them.  
他短暂地休息了一下，靠在自己的卡车后挡板上，旁边放着一瓶留在驾驶室里的水。现在他真的在做些什么，感觉好多了，但关于明日香的问题依然存在。他不想让她担心自己对未来的想法或可能发生的事情，但他们之间的关系仍未明确。他们多次接近于发生关系，但有些话还未说出口。在这一切发生之前，真嗣希望他们之间的问题能得到解决，即使他们都知道对方的感受。尽管如此，真嗣还是想从明日香口中听到那三个字，无论她需要多长时间才能说出来。

Shinji continued practicing through a large part of the night since he had ended up dreaming most of the day away, and it was well after midnight when he finally made his way back to the house. He hoped that he hadn't woken Asuka up when drove into the driveway, but when he softly tiptoed his way down the hallway and into the bedroom, he was glad to see that she was still sleeping.  
真嗣一直练习到深夜，因为他白天大部分时间都在睡觉，当他终于回到房子时已经是深夜了。他希望开车进车道时没有吵醒明日香，但当他轻轻地踮着脚走过走廊进入卧室时，他很高兴看到她还在睡觉。

Slowly stripping off his own clothes, he gently untucked the blankets from his side of the bed, and slid under the covers. Resting his head down on the pillow, he let out a relieved sigh, prepared to fall asleep.  
他缓缓地脱下自己的衣服，轻轻地从床的自己这边解开毯子，滑进被窝。将头靠在枕头上，他发出一声释然的叹息，准备入睡。

"I was wondering how long you'd be gone for."  
“我在想你还要多久才回来。”

Shinji's body jerked in surprise, not thinking that Asuka had been awake. He had certainly heard her low breathing, but he had assumed that she was asleep. Turning towards her, he saw that Asuka was leaning on her side, and looking back at him, a slight frown on her face.  
真嗣的身体因惊讶而一震，没想到明日香还醒着。他确实听到了她低沉的呼吸声，但他以为她已经睡着了。转头看向她，只见明日香侧身躺着，回望着他，脸上带着一丝不悦。

"...You haven't been awake this entire time have you?" Shinji asked after gathering himself.  
"...你一直都没醒着，对吧？" 真嗣在整理好自己后问道。

"No. I've been waking up automatically every few hours though, and always checked to see if you were here. I think not having you beside me made it more difficult to sleep."  
"没有。不过我每隔几个小时就会自动醒来，每次都会检查你是否在这里。我想没有你在身边，更难入睡了。"

This was an incredibly honest thing for Asuka to say, something which she wouldn't have been able to say in the past, but it was the truth.  
这对明日香来说是非常坦诚的话，放在过去她是说不出口的，但这是事实。

"Sorry, if I would have known that, I would have been back sooner."  
"对不起，如果我早知道，我会早点回来的。"

"No, I don't mind. I'm sure you have you're own things to think about," shrugged Asuka. "I assume that you were practicing?"  
"不，我不介意。我相信你也有自己的事情要考虑，" 明日香耸耸肩说。"我猜你是在练习吧？"

"Yeah," said Shinji. "Whether it's important or not, I feel I should continue."  
"嗯，" 真嗣说。"不管重不重要，我觉得我应该继续下去。"

"Shinji, is there something you aren't telling me?" asked Asuka suddenly.  
"真嗣，你是不是有什么事瞒着我？" 明日香突然问道。

Was there? Shinji didn't know. He had no proof for what he thought may happen, only a strange gut feeling, but that was all he was going off right now. If this was it though, then he felt no reason in alarming Asuka. It was something that he felt he could only deal with in the first place, and didn't want to worry her.  
真的有吗？真嗣自己也不确定。他没有任何证据证明自己预感的事情会发生，只有一种莫名的直觉，但目前他只能依靠这个。如果这就是全部，那么他觉得没有必要让明日香担心。这是他认为自己首先能处理的事情，不想让她担心。

"No, everything is fine," stated Shinji.  
"没有，一切都很好，" 真嗣回答道。

Asuka didn't look like she bought this, but she let it slide for now. Moving close to him, she rested her head against his chest and wrapped her arms around him.  
明日香看起来并不完全相信，但她暂时放过了这个话题。她靠近他，将头靠在他的胸前，双臂环绕着他。

"Hey...how tired are you right now?" asked Asuka slowly.  
“嘿……你现在有多累？”明日香缓缓问道。

"Talking to you has woken me up a bit. Though why?"  
“和你聊天让我清醒了一些。不过为什么问这个？”

"No reason really," said Asuka with a smile, as she leaned towards his face, pressing her lips against his. While not expecting this, Shinji kissed her back slowly, his lips melting against hers. While he didn't feel he could go for a whole round of intimacy, just kissing her like this was fine, and Asuka didn't seem to want any more than this. It wasn't even a deep kiss, but something tender shared between them while laying beside each other.  
"没什么特别的理由，" 明日香微笑着说，她倾身靠近他的脸，双唇轻触他的。虽然出乎意料，真嗣还是慢慢地回吻了她，两人的唇瓣渐渐融合。虽然他觉得无法进行更深层次的亲密，就这样吻着她已经足够，而明日香似乎也并不想要更多。这甚至不是一个深吻，而是躺在彼此身旁时分享的一份温柔。

"I feel better now," said Asuka after several moments passed.  
"我现在感觉好多了，" 明日香在片刻之后说道。

Shinji didn't say anything, but slowly placed his arms around Asuka's shoulder, drawing her close to him. He felt elated for some reason, but also felt sleep slowly coming to call him away.  
真嗣没有说话，只是慢慢地将手臂环绕在明日香的肩上，将她拉近自己。他不知为何感到欣喜，但同时也感觉到睡意渐渐袭来。

"Hey Shinji, we should do something tomorrow to celebrate the fact that we've been together for two years now," said Asuka still trying to make conversation  
"嘿，真嗣，明天我们应该做点什么来庆祝我们在一起已经两年了，" 明日香还在努力找话题

"Hmm, I'll leave it up to you then," said Shinji as he closed his eyes.  
"嗯，那就交给你决定吧，" 真嗣说着闭上了眼睛。

"What, we're in this together. You need to help out as well."  
"什么，我们是一起的。你也需要帮忙出主意。"

But she didn't get a reply from him; Shinji had already fallen asleep reminding Asuka of the earlier incident. She hoped that he wouldn't be dreaming again, since she had had enough of that nonsense already.  
但她没有收到他的回复；真嗣已经睡着了，这让明日香想起了之前的事件。她希望他不会再做梦了，因为她已经受够了那些胡言乱语。

"...lo...ve..." "...爱..."

Asuka's head whipped up to stare at Shinji's face, seeing his mouth open ever so slightly. She thought she heard him say something rather unbelievable, but she must have been mistaken.  
明日香猛地抬头盯着真嗣的脸，看到他的嘴微微张开。她以为自己听到了一些难以置信的话，但她一定是听错了。

'If you say something like that just as you fall asleep, how do you think it's gonna make me feel,' thought Asuka. She was surprised that her heart was beating faster just hearing that word, but it wasn't like Shinji was specifically saying it to her. He may have just been thinking about food that he loved, or a book, or-  
'如果你在刚睡着时说那样的话，你觉得我会怎么想，'明日香心想。她惊讶地发现，仅仅听到那个词，她的心跳就加速了，但这并不意味着真嗣是特意对她说的。他可能只是在想他喜欢的食物，或者一本书，或者——

Asuka shook her head quickly. If she started dwelling on this, she would never get to sleep.  
明日香迅速摇了摇头。如果她开始深究这个，她永远也睡不着了。

Breaking away from Shinji, she moved to her own side of the bed, and tried to ignore his light breathing, or the mumbled word that she had heard. Try as she might, she wasn't able to ignore this however, and spent most of the remaining hours until sunrise dwelling on this word, as well as what she wanted for the future.  
她挣脱真嗣的怀抱，移到床的另一侧，试图忽略他轻柔的呼吸声，或是她听到的那个含糊的词。尽管她尽力了，却无法忽视这一点，于是在日出前的剩余时间里，她大部分时间都在思考这个词，以及她对未来的期望。

### Chapter 29: Love

**This chapter was written/finished with lots of caffeine and written almost entirely in the last twenty-four hours. I'm tired in a nutshell. Anyways, two A/N warnings in this, bold lettering, you know the drill. I've got some stuff to say at the end, so I'll wait till then.  
这一章是在大量咖啡因的刺激下写完的，几乎全部是在过去的二十四小时内完成的。简而言之，我累坏了。无论如何，这一章有两个作者注释，用粗体标出，你们懂的。我有些话要在最后说，所以我会等到那时再说。**

---

Though it was rare for Shinji and Asuka to go shopping together now, when they both woke up the next morning, it was decided that they needed to. Shinji drove, since just judging by the deep bags under Asuka's eyes, she didn't seem to have gotten much sleep. When Shinji asked her about this though, she refused to answer. She had seemed fine just before he had gone to sleep, so he wondered what had happened.  
虽然现在真嗣和明日香一起购物的情况很少见，但当他们第二天早上醒来时，他们决定需要去购物。真嗣开车，因为从明日香眼下的深深黑眼圈来看，她似乎没怎么睡。当真嗣问她这件事时，她拒绝回答。她在他睡觉前似乎还好好的，所以他不知道发生了什么。

Since the grocery store in there small town had since been depleted of groceries, they had started driving closer to Kyoto, and in particular, the city that Shinji had been to months back when he had ascended the building using his AT-field. The city was moderately large, and had multiple places to shop for groceries and other necessary items, so it would still last a while before they had to find a different place to shop.  
自从他们小镇上的杂货店早已被搬空，他们开始驱车前往更靠近京都的地方，特别是真嗣几个月前曾用 AT 力场登上那座建筑的城市。这座城市规模适中，有多处购物场所可以购买食品和其他必需品，所以在找到另一个购物地点之前，他们还能维持一段时间。

While Shinji drove, Asuka was in her own mind, still thinking about the mumbled word that Shinji had said last night. It wasn't as if she didn't believe it to be true, but hearing it like that so suddenly wasn't something she had expected, so it had caught her off guard. She had been wondering if and when Shinji would say it himself, but so far, he hadn't done so. He had been talking about their future yesterday though, so that day may not be far off.  
当真嗣开车时，明日香沉浸在自己的思绪中，仍在思考昨晚真嗣含糊说出的那个词。她并非不相信那是真的，但如此突然地听到，是她未曾预料到的，因此让她措手不及。她一直在想真嗣是否会自己说出来，但到目前为止，他还没有这样做。不过，昨天他确实谈到了他们的未来，所以那一天可能不远了。

Letting out a low sigh, Asuka watched the scenery flash by while she looked out the window.  
明日香轻轻叹了口气，望着窗外飞逝的景色。

She had been with Shinji for what felt like an eternity, but it had really been a very short time when compared to the length of their lives. In these two years though, she had grown to share equal affection for him as he held for her, and maybe more so. If not, she wouldn't be willing to give her body to him.  
她与真嗣在一起的时间感觉像是一个永恒，但实际上与他们漫长的人生相比只是短暂的一瞬。尽管如此，这两年间，她对真嗣的感情已经增长到与他对自己的感情相等，甚至可能更多。如果不是这样，她也不会愿意将自己的身体交给他。

Before this shared existence, the only thing Asuka had known was being an Evangelion pilot. This was her world, her everything, and what she had chosen to do with her life. With the realization that all of this had been for naught, she had lost her place in the world, unsure what to do with herself. She had let go of that eventually, and fully embraced what she had with Shinji. If not for him, she was unsure what she would be doing, or if she'd even be alive. What if it had just been her that had woken up, and ignoring how her legs had been, could she have continued to live? Would she have even wanted to?  
在这段共同生活之前，明日香唯一知道的就是成为 EVA 驾驶员。这是她的世界，她的全部，也是她选择的生活方式。当意识到这一切都毫无意义时，她失去了在这个世界的位置，不知道该如何自处。她最终放下了这一切，全心全意地接受了与真嗣在一起的生活。如果不是因为他，她不确定自己会做什么，甚至不确定自己是否还活着。如果只有她一个人醒来，忽略双腿的情况，她还能继续生活吗？她还会想要继续吗？

Sadly, Asuka didn't think so. As much as she had secluded herself off from everybody else prior to her meeting Shinji, she wasn't so naive to believe she didn't need to communicate with other humans. She may have hated those that praised her while hiding their jealously, but it kept her going, as much as she hated to admit it. Asuka continued to exist on her pride and superiority while enjoying the praise that people showered on her, but Shinji hadn't known her then.  
遗憾的是，明日香并不这么认为。尽管在遇见真嗣之前，她已经将自己与所有人隔离开来，但她并不天真到认为自己不需要与他人交流。她可能讨厌那些表面上赞美她、内心却藏着嫉妒的人，但这种赞美却是她前进的动力，尽管她不愿承认。明日香继续依靠她的骄傲和优越感生活，享受着人们给予的赞美，但那时的真嗣并不了解她。

When Shinji had met her, it was easy to describe their relationship as lukewarm, and Asuka wondered whether Shinji loathed her then. She verbally abused him, hit him, and did everything that would warrant hate towards her. But she had always been like this, and couldn't change her personality with the flip of a switch. Despite this, Shinji still put up her, taking all her abuse and rarely rebuked her. He didn't care whether she was one of the few chosen to be Evangelion pilots, or that she had been top of her class at her university. None of this mattered to him, and so he treated her just like any human girl.  
当真嗣遇见她时，他们的关系可以用不冷不热来形容，明日香不禁怀疑那时真嗣是否讨厌她。她对他言语攻击，动手打他，做了所有会招致恨意的事情。但她一直都是这样，无法像开关一样轻易改变自己的性格。尽管如此，真嗣仍然忍受着她，接受她所有的虐待，很少反驳她。他不在乎她是否是被选中的少数几位 EVA 驾驶员之一，也不在乎她在大学里成绩是否名列前茅。这些对他来说都不重要，因此他对待她就像对待任何一个普通女孩一样。

Everything that Asuka had once known, or aspired to do was blown away when she woke up in this world, but Shinji was the one that kept pushing them forward. He did everything for her, every selfish demand that had ever come out of her mouth, he listened to. Whether Shinji knew it or not, Asuka was glad that Shinji had treated her normally.  
曾经，明日香所熟知的一切，或是她渴望实现的目标，都在她醒来时被这个世界的冲击所抹去，但正是真嗣不断推动着他们前行。他为她做了一切，她口中吐露的每一个自私的要求，他都倾听并回应。无论真嗣是否意识到，明日香很高兴真嗣能以平常心对待她。

Throughout the past two years, Asuka has slowly warmed up to him as the two journeyed from Tokyo-3 to Tokyo-2. Many times, Asuka had wondered what the faint feeling she got in her chest when she looked at Shinji was, but she had never experienced it before, so didn't know what it was. She began to realize what it was during the first winter they spent together, and had slowly come to accept it, strange as it was. She still wasn't sure we're it had started, or what had caused these feelings to manifest, but she was no longer going to ignore it.  
在过去两年中，随着两人从第三新东京市到第二新东京市的旅程，明日香逐渐对真嗣敞开了心扉。许多次，明日香在凝视真嗣时感到胸中涌起的那股微妙情感，她从未体验过，因此不知其为何物。直到他们共度的第一个冬天，她才开始意识到那是什么，并逐渐接受了这份奇异的感情。她仍不确定这份情感从何而来，又是什么触发了它，但她不再打算忽视它。

"So I as well," mumbled Asuka almost inaudibly.  
“我也是。”明日香几乎听不清地喃喃道。

"You say something?" asked Shinji.  
"你说什么吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No, just focus on driving," replied Asuka, her eyes still watching the scenery outside.  
"没有，专心开车吧，" 明日香回答，她的眼睛仍然注视着窗外的风景。

Shinji glanced sideways at her, but didn't say anything. She had been preoccupied all morning, and Shinji assumed that it was what had kept her up all night. He wondered what it was, but had a feeling she wouldn't say anything and tell him he was imagining things. Shinji thought back to last night, but couldn't remember anything that had happened that would make her act like this.  
真嗣侧目看了她一眼，但没有说什么。她整个早上都心不在焉，真嗣猜想这可能是让她整夜未眠的原因。他好奇是什么事情，但又觉得她不会说什么，只会告诉他这是他多想了。真嗣回想起昨晚，但想不起有什么事情会让她这样。

Shrugging his shoulders, he continued driving as the crosses the overpass, and entered the city.  
他耸了耸肩，继续驾车穿过立交桥，进入了城市。

---

Since Shinji was with her this time, Asuka let him do the bulk of the shopping while she wandered the isles. The store was much larger than the grocery store they had back in their town, and it doubled as a department store as well, complete with clothes, electronics, garden supplies, and a small selection of furniture. Asuka browsed around the garden supplies for a while. She still would like her own garden at some point, and they had plenty of room at their house, but next year would have to wait.  
既然这次真嗣和她一起，明日香便让他负责大部分购物，而她则在各个过道间闲逛。这家商店比他们镇上的杂货店大得多，还兼作百货商店，里面有服装、电子产品、园艺用品，甚至还有一小部分家具。明日香在园艺用品区逛了一会儿。她仍然希望将来能拥有自己的花园，他们家也有足够的空间，但明年再说吧。

She had long lost Shinji in the sea of isles and now wandered over to the clothing department. She had already been through the clothes here so many times she had lost count, and had already grabbed anything she remotely thought she would wear, but it helped to waste time at least. As far as underwear went, most of her collection was simple white, with the occasional red piece here or there since it matched her hair well, but she was eyeing a black pair currently. She wondered how Shinji would like it, more so than how it would look on her. But, black really wasn't her thing, so she left it alone.  
她在岛屿的海洋中早已失去了真嗣的踪迹，如今漫无目的地逛到了服装区。这里的衣服她已经翻来覆去看了无数遍，几乎每一件她觉得可能会穿的都拿过了，但至少这能消磨时间。至于内衣，她的收藏大多是简单的白色，偶尔会有几件红色，因为和她的头发很搭，但她现在正盯着一套黑色内衣。她好奇真嗣会怎么看待它，更甚于它穿在自己身上的样子。不过，黑色真的不是她的风格，所以她还是放弃了。

Growing bored, she decided to find Shinji and began walking along the ends of the isles, peaking down them in search of him. As she passed a certain isle though and didn't see him, she did a quick double take as her eyes swirled up to the signboard hanging above the isle. Pausing, she glanced at a certain word before slowly walking down the isle. It had suddenly struck her, and while she felt sorta awkward looking for such a thing, she was curiously nonetheless. She didn't have much knowledge on the subject, but kinda knew what she was looking for.  
渐渐感到无聊，她决定去找真嗣，开始沿着货架的尽头走，探头探脑地寻找他。然而，当她经过某个货架却没有看到他时，她迅速地回头，目光扫向悬挂在货架上方的指示牌。她停下脚步，瞥了一眼某个词，然后缓缓走进那条货架。突然间，她意识到了什么，虽然感到有些尴尬，但好奇心驱使她继续前行。她对这个领域了解不多，但大致知道自己在找什么。

Her eyes passed over the many boxed items laying on the shelf, when she suddenly glanced at a certain box, and then frowned slightly. Picking the box up at random, she glanced at the image on the front along with the words, and then turned it over. Was this what she was looking for? Asuka thought so, but she wasn't one hundred percent certain. Opening it up however, she found several oddly wrapped items which she could only assume the purpose of. Feeling even more awkward at that thought, she grabbed a handful of them, and stuffed them into her pocket. Maybe she was being overly cautious, but she really didn't want an accident occurring.  
她的目光扫过架子上摆放的众多盒装物品，突然间，她的视线停留在一个特定的盒子上，眉头微微皱起。她随意地拿起那个盒子，瞥了一眼正面的图案和文字，然后翻转过来。这是她正在寻找的东西吗？明日香觉得是，但她并没有百分之百的把握。然而，打开盒子后，她发现了几件包装奇特的物品，只能猜测它们的用途。想到这里，她感到更加尴尬，于是抓了一把，塞进了口袋。也许她过于谨慎了，但她真的不希望发生任何意外。

With this done, she began checking the isles again, aware that the item in her pocket was weighing her down mentally. She tried not to think about it, but was aware of a certain feeling she was beginning to have in the pit of her stomach.  
做完这些后，她再次开始检查过道，意识到口袋里的物品在心理上给她带来了负担。她试图不去想它，但能感觉到胃里逐渐升起一种异样的感觉。

She heard Shinji before she saw him, and he was mumbling something to himself. As she rounded the corner, she saw him kneeling beside a shelf and examining two canned items, trying to decide what he wanted. He was much more meticulous then her when shopping, and Asuka always just went with whatever the norm was, but Shinji still liked to experiment a bit in what he could cook on their grill.  
她还没见到真嗣就先听到了他的声音，他正喃喃自语着什么。当她转过拐角时，看到他正跪在货架旁，仔细检查着两罐物品，试图决定要选哪个。购物时他比她更细致，而明日香总是随大流，但真嗣仍然喜欢在他能用烤架烹饪的食材上做些尝试。

Asuka watched him for a while as she stood at the end of the isle. Shinji was so preoccupied that he didn't notice her at first. When he finally made his decision, and stood up, he glanced down the isle and saw her standing there.  
明日香站在过道尽头观察了他一会儿。真嗣太过专注，一开始并没有注意到她。当他终于做出决定并站起来时，他瞥了一眼过道，看到了站在那里的她。

"Asuka? How long have you been standing there?"  
“明日香？你站在这里多久了？”

"Not long," she replied. She hoped her voice sounded normal, but she still felt an odd sensation in her stomach.  
“不久，”她回答道。她希望自己的声音听起来正常，但她仍感到胃里一阵莫名的感觉。

Shinji eyed her for a second, confused at her peculiar behavior, but shrugged it off. Dumping the canned food in the cart, he walked down the isle away from Asuka, his eyes passing over the many canned goods on the shelf. He thought about cooking a rather extravagant dinner tonight, considering it had been around two years since they had both met each other.  
真嗣盯着她看了一会儿，对她奇怪的行为感到困惑，但还是耸了耸肩没在意。他把罐头食品扔进购物车，沿着过道走开，远离明日香，目光扫过货架上琳琅满目的罐头。他想着今晚要准备一顿相当丰盛的晚餐，毕竟他们相遇已经大约两年了。

Pausing again in the isle, he focused on another shelf. While Shinji continuing pouring over the labels, he didn't notice that Asuka was slowly approaching him. Her face was flushed red as she pondered over multiple things. Her entire body was burning up, and only one thing would remedy this feeling.  
他在过道里再次停下，目光转向另一个货架。当真嗣继续仔细查看标签时，他没注意到明日香正慢慢向他靠近。她的脸颊通红，心中思绪万千。她全身都在发热，只有一件事能缓解这种感觉。

Finally hearing her approaching footsteps, Shinji turned to look at her, slightly startled by the expression she had.  
终于听到她走近的脚步声，真嗣转头看向她，被她的表情微微吓了一跳。

"Asuka?" he wondered as he slowly stood up.  
“明日香？”他疑惑地慢慢站起身来。

Shinji didn't get a verbal reply from her, but Asuka surged forward pressing her lips violently against his, kissing him deeply. Shinji was caught of guard by her suddenness, and he backed up a step, but collided against one of the metal shelves on the isle. Cans began spilling onto the ground with his back pressed against the shelf, but Asuka didn't care about this, continuing to kiss him.  
真嗣没有得到她的口头回应，但明日香猛地冲上前，用力地将嘴唇压在他的唇上，深深地吻着他。真嗣被她的突然举动惊到，后退了一步，却撞上了过道里的金属架。罐头开始从架子上掉落，他的背紧贴着架子，但明日香对此毫不在意，继续吻着他。

She pressed her body against his, her tongue forcefully entering his mouth. It wasn't unheard of them to kiss each other quickly while shopping, but they had never done this before. Shinji honestly wasn't ready for this, and would have rather just gotten the shopping done and gone home, but Asuka had other plans.  
她将身体紧贴着他，舌头强行探入他的口中。他们在购物时快速亲吻并不罕见，但从未像这样。真嗣真心没准备好，宁愿赶紧买完东西回家，但明日香另有打算。

Her hands starting fumbling at the hem of his shirt, trying to take it off, but Shinji restrained her. Not giving up however, her right hand instead found its way to his jeans, pressing against his groin. Against his own wishes, Shinji felt himself start to grow hard as Asuka's hand began massaging the slight bulge that had appeared.  
她的手开始在衬衫下摆摸索，试图脱掉它，但真嗣制止了她。然而她并未放弃，右手转而伸向他的牛仔裤，按在他的腹股沟上。违背自己的意愿，真嗣感到自己开始变硬，明日香的手开始揉搓那微微隆起的部位。

Still, this wasn't the time or place for this, and Shinji drew back from Asuka's lips suddenly to speak his mind.  
尽管如此，这不是合适的时间和地点，真嗣突然从明日香的唇边退开，表达自己的想法。

"Asuka, let's not do this here."  
"明日香，我们别在这里做这件事。"

"Why not? It's not like anyone is going to interrupt us."  
"为什么不行？又没人会来打扰我们。"

"Even so," started Shinji, but he lost his voice as Asuka's hand continued stroking him.  
"即便如此，" 真嗣开口说道，但当明日香的手继续抚摸他时，他便失声了。"

"You need to be more honest," she grinned mischievously.  
"你需要更诚实些，"她调皮地笑着说。

Her right hand continued pressing against his erection, and she began kissing him again. Shinji wanted to refuse her, but his mind was slowly slipping away. Finally, he kissed her back, entwining his tongue with hers, and wrapped his arms around her, drawing her closer to him. He  
她的右手继续按在他的勃起上，并再次开始亲吻他。真嗣想要拒绝她，但他的意识正逐渐远去。最终，他回吻了她，与她的舌头缠绵交织，双臂环绕着她，将她拉得更近。他

didn't know what had brought this on, but it was clear that Asuka was excited. Even through both her shirt and bra, he could feel her nipples digging into his chest. He very much wanted to remove her top, but something held him back. He still didn't feel this was right to do in a store.  
不知道是什么引发了这一切，但显然明日香很兴奋。即使隔着她的衬衫和胸罩，他也能感觉到她的乳头抵在他的胸前。他非常想脱掉她的上衣，但某种东西阻止了他。他仍然觉得在店里这样做是不对的。

Asuka had the complete opposite opinion on this though. No matter where or when, she wanted Shinji. It didn't matter whether it was in their house, car, this store, the hot springs, or some location they hadn't discovered. The where didn't matter, and the when was nearly at any given moment. All that mattered was that she had Shinji.  
但对此，明日香却持有完全相反的看法。无论何时何地，她都想要真嗣。无论是家中、车上、这家店、温泉，还是他们未曾发现的地方，地点并不重要，时间也几乎可以是任何时刻。唯一重要的是，她拥有真嗣。

As she started to grow more aroused, her hand slid up inside Shinji's shirt, her hands gliding across her chest, and pinching his nipples. Shinji held back the groan that bubbled up his throat, but Asuka's right hand found new vigor as it danced around his erection, forcing it out. Both were panting now, and Asuka could feel a sweet moistness seeping between her legs. She was nearing her limit, and her mind quickly flashed to what she had in her pocket, but Shinji had reached his limit.  
随着她愈发兴奋，她的手滑入真嗣的衬衫内，双手在他胸前游走，轻捏他的乳头。真嗣强忍住喉咙里涌出的呻吟，但明日香的右手却焕发出新的活力，围绕着他的勃起舞动，迫使其显露。两人都喘息着，明日香能感觉到双腿间甜蜜的湿润感。她快要达到极限了，脑海中迅速闪过口袋里的东西，但真嗣已经到达了极限。

Grasping her shoulders, he gently pushed her away. He was frowning, but wasn't angry at her, just confused why she had tried to do this right here.  
他抓住她的肩膀，轻轻将她推开。他皱着眉头，但并非对她生气，只是困惑她为何要在这里尝试这样做。

"What?" asked Asuka, slightly abrasive.  
"什么？" 明日香略带刺地问道。

"Sorry, I still don't feel this is the proper place."  
"抱歉，我还是觉得这里不太合适。"

"What does it matter?" "这有什么关系呢？"

"I don't know. Maybe I'm being dumb, but I prefer doing this in our own house."  
"我不知道。也许我挺傻的，但我更喜欢在自己家里做这件事。"

"You're right, that is dumb," said Asuka.  
"你说得对，这确实很傻，" 明日香说道。"

They were silent for a moment, still holding each other while their faces were mere inches apart. Asuka broke free though, knowing that Shinji wasn't going to budge on this. She didn't agree with this, and the feeling deep inside of her hadn't disappeared yet.  
他们沉默了一会儿，依然紧紧相拥，脸庞相距仅几英寸。然而明日香挣脱了，她知道真嗣在这件事上不会让步。她并不赞同这一点，内心深处的感觉也尚未消失。

"Fine, have it your way," sighed Asuka as she stepped away from him.  
“好吧，随你便，”明日香叹了口气，从他身边走开。

Shinji watched her suddenly become preoccupied with something on the shelf opposite where they had just been kissing. Truthfully, he didn't want to stop, and he bulge in his pants wasn't going down anytime soon, especially with his eyes wavering to Asuka's butt. Trying to suppress his desires, he refocused his attention on the canned food, ignoring the slight humming coming from Asuka behind him.  
真嗣看着她突然对货架上刚刚他们接吻的地方对面的某样东西产生了兴趣。说实话，他并不想停下来，他的裤裆里的凸起也没有任何消退的迹象，尤其是他的目光还时不时飘向明日香的臀部。他试图压抑自己的欲望，重新将注意力集中在罐头食品上，忽略了身后明日香轻微的哼唱声。

When Shinji was finally satisfied with the amount of food he had stacked in the cart, he went to look for Asuka who had disappeared again. He found her sitting in the middle of an isle, a stack of books placed on either side of her. She seemed to be going through the few books they had scoured in the store, trying to decided which to read next. Most of them seemed pretty bad just judging from the cover, but they had exhausted most reading material that they could find in the first place.  
当真嗣终于对购物车里的食物数量感到满意时，他去找明日香，却发现她又不见了。他在一条过道的中间找到了她，她的两边各堆着一摞书。她似乎正在翻阅他们在店里搜罗的几本书，试图决定接下来读哪一本。仅从封面判断，大多数书看起来都不怎么样，但他们已经耗尽了能找到的大部分阅读材料。

"Ready to go?" asked Shinji.  
“准备好了吗？” 真嗣问道。

"More or less," answered Asuka, not bothering to put the books back that she had taken off the shelf. She hadn't found anything that she wanted it seemed, but Shinji had somewhat expected this.  
“差不多吧，” 明日香回答，懒得把从书架上拿下来的书放回去。她似乎没找到想要的东西，但真嗣对此多少有所预料。

Pushing the shopping cart through the store, they exited through the busted automatic doors courtesy of Shinji's AT-field. Loading everything into the back of the the truck and securing everything in place, Shinji threw a blue tarp over the canned goods that he usually used to keep the firewood dry in case it rained.  
推着购物车穿过商店，他们从真嗣 AT 力场破坏的自动门离开了。把所有东西装进卡车后部并固定好，真嗣用一块蓝色防水布盖住了罐头食品，这块布他通常用来防止木柴被雨淋湿。

Jumping into the cab, he started the truck, and then turned to Asuka, about to ask her if she was set. She wasn't looking at him though, her eyes staring down at the floor mats instead. She hadn't bothered to put on her seatbelt yet either, and Shinji was about to ask her if there was a problem when she turned to him. Shinji knew the expression on her face, since it was one he had seen very recently in the store before she had kissed him.  
跳进驾驶室，他启动了卡车，然后转向明日香，正要问她是否准备好了。但她并没有看他，而是盯着脚下的地板垫。她甚至还没系上安全带，真嗣正要问她是不是有什么问题，她却转过头来。真嗣认得她脸上的表情，因为不久前在店里她吻他之前，他刚刚见过。

He had expected it, but when Asuka slowly started crawling across the seat towards him in a seductive manner, Shinji felt himself quickly grow aroused again. He moved himself so that his back was against the door, and when Asuka neared him she quickly turned off the truck before sliding onto his lap. Sitting up fully, her head almost brushed the top of the truck, while her long hair was draped behind her, spilling onto Shinji's legs. She paused however before doing anything, and looked at Shinji's questionably.  
他早有预料，但当明日香缓缓地以一种诱人的姿态爬过座位向他靠近时，真嗣感到自己再次迅速兴奋起来。他挪动身体，背靠车门，明日香靠近时迅速关掉了引擎，然后滑到他腿上。她坐直身子，头几乎碰到了车顶，长发披散在身后，垂落在真嗣的腿上。然而，在进一步动作之前，她停了下来，疑惑地看着真嗣。

"Is this alright?" she asked, referring to his reluctance to do this in the store. Shinji didn't need even a second to respond to this.  
“这样可以吗？”她问道，指的是他在店里对此事的犹豫。真嗣不需要一秒钟就给出了回答。

"It is," he quickly said.  
“是的，”他迅速说道。

Getting his acceptance, Asuka leaned herself forward, pressing her lips against his. They kissed deeply, their bodies presses against one another, with Shinji's back pressing roughly against the driver door. His hands snaked around her back, running them through her long hair, enjoying the way it parted for him. Their tongues found each other, and quickly started dancing with each other as they exchanged saliva.  
得到他的同意，明日香向前倾身，将双唇紧贴在他的唇上。他们深情地拥吻，身体紧紧相贴，真嗣的后背粗暴地抵在驾驶门上。他的双手环绕过她的背部，穿过她那长长的秀发，享受着发丝为他分开的触感。他们的舌头相互探寻，很快便开始共舞，交换着彼此的唾液。

**(A/N: Sexual acts, no actual intercourse, look for next bold lettering for summary...and this is a long one.)  
（作者注：涉及性行为，但无实际性交，请留意下一段粗体字以获取摘要...这一段相当长。）**

Asuka had waited long enough however, and wasn't going to settle for 'no' this time, even if Shinji pleaded with her. Drawing back from the kiss, she grasped the hem of her shirt, and pulled it over her head in one fluid motion, chucking it behind her where it collided with the door and fell onto the floor behind her. Sitting on Shinji's lap, she gazed down at him, watching as his eyes stared at her breasts hidden by her bra. No matter how often this happened, Asuka was glad that Shinji never got tired of this sight.  
然而，明日香已经等得够久了，这次她不打算接受‘不’的答案，即使真嗣向她恳求。她从亲吻中退开，抓住衬衫的下摆，一气呵成地将其从头上脱下，扔向身后，衬衫撞在门上，然后落在她身后的地板上。她坐在真嗣的腿上，低头凝视着他，看着他的眼睛盯着她被胸罩遮住的胸部。无论这种情况发生多少次，明日香都很高兴真嗣从未对此感到厌倦。

Falling back into his arms, they continued kissing, while Shinji's hands started tracing patterns along her back with his nails. She started squirming, but didn't mind this in the least. The spot between her legs started to become moist, and her body started sweating. She felt like she had a fever as she kissed Shinji. The car started fogging up as they continued with their passion, but neither were aware of this.  
她倒回他的怀抱，继续亲吻，而真嗣的手开始用指甲在她背上画着图案。她开始扭动，但一点也不介意。她双腿之间的部位开始湿润，身体也开始出汗。她感觉自己像是在发烧，一边亲吻着真嗣。随着他们的激情继续，车内开始起雾，但两人都没有注意到这一点。

Having reached his own limit of suppression, Shinji quickly undid the clasp of Asuka's bra, something which he had quickly gotten good at. With the clasp undone from her back, Asuka sat up, letting her breasts easily sway freely. While she sat on his lap, Shinji removed his own shirt, and threw it to the floorboard beside him. They embraced again, as skin touched skin, and Shinji was surprised at how hot Asuka's body was.  
已经压抑到极限的 Shinji 迅速解开了 Asuka 胸罩的扣子，这是他很快就熟练起来的事情。随着扣子从她背后解开，Asuka 坐起身，让她的胸部轻松地自由摇摆。当她坐在他的腿上时，Shinji 脱掉了自己的衬衫，并把它扔到了旁边的地板上。他们再次拥抱，当肌肤相触时，Shinji 惊讶于 Asuka 的身体是如此炽热。

They kissed sweetly then, enthralled in each other's affection. Shinji never wanted this to end, but knew this could never be true. There was always a cut off point, or at least until they reached their respective climaxes.  
他们甜蜜地亲吻着，沉浸在彼此的爱意中。Shinji 从未希望这一切结束，但他知道这永远不可能成真。总有一个截止点，或者至少直到他们达到各自的顶峰。

Asuka slowly started moving her hips, pressing against Shinji's erection, and he in turn started to move as well. They kissed more deeply, forgetting the fact they were in a truck, imagining that they were back home on their couch, or bed. Shinji's thing was pressing uncomfortably against his jeans, but he wasn't sure whether to remove them or not. Asuka seemed fine with things as they were currently, and was even smiling slightly. She was enjoying herself immensely, relieved that they were doing this. The thought of going home was so far from her mind that all she cared about was this moment.  
明日香缓缓开始扭动腰肢，紧贴着真嗣的勃起，而他也不由自主地随之动作。他们的吻愈发深沉，忘记了身处卡车之中，幻想着回到了家中沙发或床上。真嗣的欲望顶得牛仔裤颇为不适，但他犹豫是否该脱掉。明日香似乎对现状颇为满意，甚至微微一笑。她正享受着这一刻，庆幸他们终于迈出了这一步。回家的念头早已抛诸脑后，此刻她只在乎这一瞬间。

Shinji broke off the kiss though; his eyes had been traveling down to his chest where Asuka's breasts were resting for a while. Understanding his desire, Asuka removed herself from his chest, and arched her body above his so that her head was pressing against the window of the door. Her breasts were now fully in Shinji's face and he stared at them for several seconds before his lips latched onto one of her erect nipples, sucking on it as if he were a baby.  
然而，真嗣突然结束了这个吻；他的目光早已游移至胸前，那里明日香的乳房正轻倚着。明白他的渴望，明日香从他胸前移开，身体弓起悬于他上方，头抵在车门玻璃上。她的双乳此刻完全展现在真嗣眼前，他凝视了几秒后，嘴唇便含住了她挺立的乳头，吮吸得如同婴儿般。

Asuka couldn't help but let out a low cry, her body surging with electricity. She couldn't contain the feeling she was having, and felt something welling up between her legs, ready to burst at any moment. But after two months of this, Asuka was also more resilient to Shinji's advances. While her body squirmed with pleasure, Shinji continued sucking on her breasts, hardly noticing the moans that were escaping her mouth.  
明日香忍不住发出低低的呻吟，身体被电流涌动的感觉充斥。她无法抑制这种感觉，只觉得下体有什么在涌动，随时都可能爆发。但经过两个月的这种经历，明日香对真嗣的挑逗也变得更加坚韧。尽管她的身体因快感而扭动，真嗣继续吮吸着她的乳房，几乎没注意到她口中逃逸的呻吟。

Shinji didn't think he'd ever get tired of this for as long as he lives. His tongue swirled around her nipple, rolling it around in his mouth, savoring the taste of her soft flesh. He alternated between her breasts, moving his mouth from one to the other. His mind was in a haze, lost as he continued exploring her body.  
真嗣觉得，只要他还活着，就永远不会厌倦这个。他的舌头在她乳头上打转，口中滚动着，享受着她柔软肌肤的味道。他交替吮吸着她的双乳，从一边移到另一边。他的思绪陷入一片迷雾，迷失在她身体的探索中。

He could no longer ignore the uncomfortable feeling in his pants however, and placed his hands on Asuka's hips, moving her away from him slightly. Asuka glanced at him briefly, before her eyes traveled down to his waist. She understood what he wanted, and so drew back slightly to the end of the truck. Quickly, Shinji unbuttoned his pants and dropped them on the floor beside him. Unknown to him, Asuka was doing the same, and they were soon in nothing but their underwear.  
然而，他再也无法忽视裤子里那股不适感，于是将双手放在明日香的臀部，轻轻将她从自己身边移开。明日香瞥了他一眼，目光随即下移至他的腰间。她明白他的意图，便稍稍退回到卡车尾部。迅速地，真嗣解开裤扣，将裤子丢在脚边。他未曾察觉，明日香也在做同样的事，很快两人便只剩下了内衣。

Shinji stared at Asuka well formed body hungrily, and before Asuka could make a move, Shinji was already across the cab, pressing Asuka against the door as his lips found hers. Their bodies pressed against one another, their tongues entwined, and Shinji placed one hand over Asuka's breast, pinching her nipple. Asuka moaned, her voice echoing in Shinji's mouth as they kissed, and her hand quickly found the bulge pressing against his boxers. She could feel the heat through the thin fabric, and thought that it might pop out at any second. She didn't thinking her heart couldn't handle that if it did.  
真嗣饥渴地盯着明日香匀称的身体，未等明日香有所动作，真嗣已跨过驾驶室，将明日香压在车门上，双唇紧贴。两人的身体紧紧相贴，舌头交缠，真嗣一手覆在明日香的乳房上，轻捏她的乳头。明日香呻吟着，声音在真嗣的口中回荡，她的手迅速找到他内裤下的凸起。她能透过薄薄的布料感受到那股热度，心想它随时都可能弹出。她不敢想象，如果真的发生了，自己的心脏是否承受得住。

They played with each other's bodies, exploring nearly every inch until both of them were dripping in sweat. For Asuka though, she wasn't satisfied with this any longer. The spot between her legs was throbbing painfully, something which she wanted to correct. She had grown accustomed to relieving Shinji in her own way, but he hadn't done the same yet.  
他们彼此探索着对方的身体，几乎每一寸肌肤都被触及，直到两人都汗流浃背。但对于明日香来说，她已不再满足于此。她双腿间的那处地方疼痛难忍，她想要解决这个问题。她已经习惯了用自己的方式让真嗣得到舒缓，但他却还未以同样的方式回应她。

Drawing back from him, Shinji glanced back quizzically at her, wondering why she had stopped kissing him. Asuka had a slight blush on her face, something which Shinji thought they had been passed at this point, considering what they had grown accustomed to. Asuka was biting her lips slightly, but she seemed to be set on something. Wrapping her arms around him slowly, she placed her head against his shoulder and then whispered into his ear.  
真嗣从她身边退开，疑惑地回头看她，不明白她为何停止了亲吻。明日香的脸颊微微泛红，考虑到他们已经习惯的事情，真嗣本以为他们已经过了这个阶段。明日香轻咬着嘴唇，似乎下定了某种决心。她缓缓地用双臂环抱住他，将头靠在他的肩上，然后在他耳边低语。

"Hey, I want you to do something for me."  
“嘿，我想让你为我做件事。”

Shinji eyes swiveled to the side, trying to focus on Asuka's face, but he couldn't see her properly.  
真嗣的目光转向一旁，试图聚焦在明日香的脸庞上，但他无法清晰地看到她。

"What is it?" asked Shinji slowly.  
“怎么了？”真嗣缓缓问道。

Asuka didn't reply, but a smile appeared on her lips. With one arm still around Shinji's back, she took her other hand and placed it over his own, entwining her hand with his. Leaning away from him, she took his hand and placed it between her breasts. Shinji didn't understand this gesture since he had just had his hands over her breasts, but then she started guiding his hand down her chest, passing over her navel, and just stopping at her underwear. It slowly dawned on Shinji what she wanted, and even though Asuka wanted this, Shinji still asked for her confirmation.  
明日香没有回答，但她的唇边浮现出一抹微笑。她用一只手臂依然环抱着真嗣的背部，另一只手则握住他的手，与他十指相扣。她微微后仰，将他的手放在自己的双乳之间。真嗣对这一举动感到不解，因为他刚刚才抚摸过她的胸部，但随后她开始引导他的手沿着她的胸口向下移动，经过肚脐，停在她的内裤边缘。真嗣渐渐明白了她的意图，尽管明日香希望如此，他仍向她寻求确认。

"Asuka, is this...?" "明日香，这是...？"

She didn't reply, but simply nodded at him, her blue eyes staring into his brown ones. If she was okay with this, then so was Shinji. Sliding his hand out of her own, Shinji's hand slowly traveled over her underwear, and when his hand brushed over her spot, Asuka inhaled sharply.  
她没有回答，只是向他点了点头，蓝色的眼睛凝视着他棕色的双眸。如果她对此没问题，那么真嗣也觉得可以。真嗣从她的手中抽出手，缓缓地滑过她的内裤，当他的手触碰到她的敏感点时，明日香猛地吸了一口气。

This was a first for him, so Shinji wasn't exactly sure what he should be doing, but he understood the basics at least. When it came down to it, it wasn't all that different to what Asuka had been doing to him. He began running his hand over the spot between her legs, gliding over it. He knew that Asuka was excited, but it didn't prepare him for how moist her underwear was, and he could see there was a faint stain thanks to this moistness. His eyes flickered up the Asuka, making sure that she was still okay with this, but judging by her expression, she was wholly lost in her own pleasure.  
这对他来说是第一次，所以真嗣并不完全确定自己应该做什么，但他至少明白基本原理。归根结底，这与明日香对他所做的事情并没有太大不同。他开始用手在她双腿间的敏感点上来回抚摸，轻轻滑过。他知道明日香很兴奋，但这并没有让他准备好面对她内裤的湿润程度，他能看到由于这种湿润而产生的淡淡污渍。他的目光闪向明日香，确认她是否仍然对此感到舒适，但从她的表情来看，她已经完全沉浸在自己的快感之中。

Becoming more daring, he starting gently running his index finger over it. Even with the small amount of pressure he was exerting in his finger, he could still feel Asuka's soft flesh parting as his finger passed back and forth over her slit. He was amused though by Asuka's expressions that were wildly changing on her face. She was holding herself back as much as possible, but it was clear that this was far too stimulating.  
他变得更加大胆，开始轻轻地用食指抚摸那里。尽管他施加在手指上的压力很小，但仍能感觉到明日香的柔软肌肤随着手指来回划过她的裂缝而分开。他觉得明日香脸上表情剧烈变化的样子很有趣。她尽可能地克制自己，但显然这刺激太过强烈了。

Beginning to apply more pressure, Shinji finger sank into her flesh, parting it easily. He starting going slowly, and then suddenly faster, alternating between gentle, and more rough. The moistness that was seeping between her legs had now turned Shinji's finger wet as well, but this only served to turn him on further. He was growing more aroused, his erection pressing against his boxers. He was strongly aware of how close they were to committing the act, and if Asuka gave her okay, Shinji probably wouldn't have given it a second thought. Right now, he didn't care whether they were doing this in a truck or not. Truthfully, he wanted to pull Asuka's underwear off and see her fully naked body, but he held himself back. This was enough for now.  
开始施加更多压力，真嗣的手指陷入了她的肉体，轻松地将它分开。他先是慢慢进行，然后突然加快，交替着温柔和粗暴。她双腿间渗出的湿润已经让真嗣的手指也变得湿漉漉的，但这只是让他更加兴奋。他越来越激动，勃起顶着他的内裤。他强烈意识到他们离那件事有多近，如果明日香同意，真嗣可能不会多想。现在，他不在乎他们是否在卡车里做这件事。说实话，他想脱掉明日香的内裤，看她完全赤裸的身体，但他克制住了自己。现在这样就够了。

Meanwhile, Asuka's expectations had been completely betrayed, but not in a bad way. She had done this by herself multiple times when the mood struck her, but having Shinji do it was like nothing she had ever expected. Her entire body felt like it was melting, starting from where he was touching her and traveling all along her body. She jerked, twitched, jolted, and squirmed her body at every movement that he was making. She was close, she knew, but just a little more and-  
与此同时，明日香原本的期待被彻底颠覆，但并非以一种糟糕的方式。她自己也曾多次在情绪高涨时这样做过，但让真嗣来做却是她始料未及的。从他触碰她的地方开始，她的整个身体仿佛都在融化，沿着全身蔓延。她随着他的每一个动作抽搐、颤抖、扭动。她知道自己已经接近极限，只差一点点——

Asuka suddenly screamed, her voice bouncing all around the cab, as her body gave a mighty jolt. Her mind had long since been lost in pleasure, but Shinji had suddenly inserted his finger, pushing the cotton and flesh aside as his finger entered her. This has been far to sudden, and Asuka glanced down somewhat annoyed at Shinji, who looked like he was thinking of apologizing. She hadn't expected it, so it had come as a shock, but Asuka wasn't about to tell him to stop, not now.  
明日香突然尖叫起来，声音在驾驶舱内回荡，她的身体猛地一震。她的意识早已迷失在快感之中，但真嗣突然插入的手指，推开了棉布和肌肤，进入了她。这一切来得太过突然，明日香有些恼怒地瞥向真嗣，他看起来像是在考虑道歉。她没有预料到这一幕，所以感到震惊，但明日香并不打算让他停下来，至少现在不会。

Since she hadn't reprimanded him, Shinji took this to mean it was okay to keep going. It was impossible to compare the two instances of rubbing his finger against her spot, and actually placing his finger inside her; the later was far more incredible. Even though his finger was pressing against her flesh through the cotton, he could still feel everything. The warmth, moistness, and softness was far beyond what Shinji had imagined, and his finger was throughly soaked now.  
既然她没有责备他，真嗣便认为这意味着可以继续下去。用手指轻触她的敏感点与实际将手指伸入她体内，这两者无法相提并论；后者要奇妙得多。尽管他的手指隔着棉布按压着她的肌肤，他仍能感受到一切。那份温暖、湿润与柔软远超真嗣的想象，此刻他的手指已完全浸湿。

Slowly he started moving, exploring Asuka's depths. He only had one finger inserted, but judging be the change in Asuka's expression, this didn't matter. Quickly though, Shinji began to notice something. Whenever Asuka moved her body in any sort of fashion, or tensed up, her flesh would wrap around his finger, smothering it. Just as he had done earlier, he started alternating his pace, going slow, and then fast. He was enjoying watching the expressions of ecstasy appear on Asuka's face.  
他缓缓开始移动，探索着明日香的深处。虽然只插入了一根手指，但看明日香表情的变化，这似乎并不重要。然而很快，真嗣开始注意到一些事情。每当明日香以任何方式移动身体或紧张时，她的肉体就会包裹住他的手指，紧紧缠绕。正如之前所做的那样，他开始变换节奏，时而缓慢，时而快速。他享受着看着明日香脸上浮现出陶醉的表情。

He changed tactics though as a sudden thought sprang to mind. While he continued focusing on the spot between her legs, his other hand found her breast, cupping it gently, and then started to pinch her pink nipple. Asuka let out another scream at this two way assault, her body writhing in pleasure. Shinji felt her body squeeze him, and knew that she was about there.  
他随即改变了策略，一个突如其来的念头闪过脑海。尽管他继续专注于她双腿之间的那一点，另一只手却找到了她的乳房，轻轻地捧起，然后开始捏弄她粉嫩的乳头。明日香在这双重攻击下再次尖叫，身体因快感而扭动。真嗣感觉到她的身体紧缩，知道她快要到达极限了。

Finally, he pressed his forefinger against the spot between her legs, slowly inserting it where it met his index finger. Coupled with this, and the pinching of her nipples, Asuka's body tensed wildly, clamping down on his fingers as she screamed, reaching her climax. As this happened however, Shinji quickly leaned up to her, pressing his lips roughly against hers, silencing the shrill scream that has escaped her lips. Though she had just climaxed, she ravenously kissed him back, melting in his lips.  
最终，他用食指按在她双腿之间的那一点，缓缓插入，与中指汇合。与此同时，乳头的捏弄让明日香的身体剧烈紧绷，紧紧夹住他的手指，她尖叫着达到了高潮。然而就在这一刻，真嗣迅速俯身向她，粗暴地吻上她的唇，堵住了那即将脱口而出的尖锐叫声。尽管刚刚经历过高潮，她却贪婪地回吻着他，沉醉在他的唇间。

Shinji drew his fingers out from inside her, and began leaning back, but Asuka had throughly had enough, and pushed him backwards, falling on top of him in exhaustion. They laid there for several minutes, Asuka slowly calming herself down, while Shinji did his best as well. He was still rigid, but didn't think that Asuka would be up for getting him off after what had just happened.  
真嗣将手指从她体内抽出，开始向后仰，但明日香已经彻底受够了，她用力将他推倒，疲惫地趴在他身上。他们就这样躺了几分钟，明日香慢慢平复情绪，而真嗣也尽力让自己冷静下来。他仍然硬挺着，但觉得经历了刚才的事情，明日香应该不会再想帮他解决。

**(Ends here. All the usual things of course, but this time Asuka asks Shinji to finger her, which he does, though its through her underwear.)  
（到此结束。当然都是些平常的事，但这次明日香让真嗣用手指帮她，他照做了，尽管隔着她的内裤。）**

"Asuka, is it all right if I get up. I just noticed that the car has entirely fogged up."  
“明日香，我可以起来吗？我刚注意到车窗已经完全起雾了。”

Asuka groaned, seeming to not want this, but she glanced around at the windows and windshield, seeing that he was right. Slowly lifting herself of him, she started gathering up her clothes and dressed herself. Shinji started the car and rolled down the windows before dressing as well. Not only the windows, but the truck itself needed to air out a bit.  
明日香呻吟了一声，似乎并不情愿，但她环顾四周的窗户和挡风玻璃，意识到他是对的。她慢慢地从他身上起来，开始收拾自己的衣服并穿上。真嗣启动了汽车，摇下车窗，然后也穿上了衣服。不仅是窗户，整个卡车也需要透透气。

They sat in their respective seats, the defroster going as the fog slowly subsided. Shinji didn't know how much time had passed, and he just remembered why they were even here in the first place. He had completely forgotten about the shopping they had finished a little while ago.  
他们各自坐在座位上，除雾器开始工作，雾气慢慢消散。真嗣不知道已经过去了多少时间，他只是突然想起了他们来这里的初衷。他完全忘记了他们不久前刚完成的购物。

Glancing over at Asuka, it was clear that she was thinking to herself. She had calmed down now, but the situation felt a little strange. Shinji wasn't sure what he was supposed to say to her. It was obvious that she had enjoyed herself, though Shinji felt like he should say something.  
瞥了一眼明日香，很明显她在沉思。她现在已经平静下来，但情况感觉有点奇怪。真嗣不确定该对她说些什么。显然她很享受，但真嗣觉得他应该说点什么。

"Umm...Asuka?" "嗯...明日香？"

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"I...well..." "我...这个..."

Asuka glanced over at him, wondering what he was thinking about saying. Those three words popped into her mind for a moment, but Shinji had missed that opportunity to speak them a while ago. It wouldn't work right now if he said it. Instead, Asuka felt at the very least that she should apologize for being the only one to enjoy herself.  
明日香瞥了他一眼，想知道他在想什么。那三个字在她脑海中闪过一瞬，但真嗣早已错过了说出口的时机。现在说出来已经不合适了。相反，明日香觉得至少她应该为自己是唯一一个享受其中的人而道歉。

"Sorry, I probably should have taken your thoughts into consideration, but I lost my sense of reason."  
"对不起，我可能应该考虑你的感受，但我失去了理智。"

"No, you don't have to apologize Asuka. It...felt good for me too, so-"  
"不，你不必道歉，明日香。对我来说...感觉也很好，所以——"

Asuka couldn't help but feel embarrassed slightly at his statement. It had only been his fingers, but he had driven her far beyond anything she had experienced before. If he had enjoyed it as well, then Asuka felt a little better about it.  
听到他的话，明日香不禁感到有些害羞。虽然只是他的手指，但他带给她的体验远远超出了她以往的任何感受。如果他也享受其中，那么明日香对此感到稍微释怀了一些。

"I suppose we should head home now," said Shinji.  
"我想我们现在该回家了，" 真嗣说道。

"Agreed," muttered Asuka.  
"同意，" 明日香低声说。

Without any further words, Shinji put the truck in gear, and drove out of the parking lot. They were on there way home.  
没有再多说什么，真嗣挂上档，驶出了停车场。他们踏上了回家的路。

---

After packing away all the groceries, Shinji brewed some fresh coffee for them, though more for Asuka's benefit. Since she had slept fitfully last night, and coupled with what had happened in the truck, her conscious was wavering. She had nearly dropped several plastic bags filled with cans while they were bringing them inside, and Shinji eventually told her that he could deal with the rest. He suggested that she take a nap, since it was still a long way until he'd even consider cooking dinner, but she said she would force herself to stay awake for the rest of the day.  
收拾完所有杂货后，真嗣为他们煮了些新鲜咖啡，虽然更多是为了明日香。昨晚她睡得不安稳，再加上卡车里发生的事，她的意识开始摇摆。她在搬进屋时差点摔了好几个装满罐头的塑料袋，最终真嗣告诉她剩下的他来处理。他建议她小睡一会儿，因为离他考虑做晚饭还有很长时间，但她表示会强迫自己保持清醒度过这一天。

They sat together on the couch, leaning against one another, though even with her coffee cup emptied beside her, Asuka was still nodding off. Just being beside Shinji like this made her feel at peace, and multiple times he had to nudge her gently to be sure she didn't fall asleep. She snuggled against him, relaxed in the warmth shared between them. How easy it would be for her to fall asleep right now...  
他们一起坐在沙发上，彼此依偎，尽管咖啡杯已空，明日香仍频频打盹。仅仅是这样靠近真嗣就让她感到平静，他不得不多次轻轻推她，确保她没有睡着。她依偎在他身上，沉浸在他们共享的温暖中。此刻她多么容易入睡啊...

"Asuka? Hey?" “明日香？嘿？”

"Hmm, sorry," she mumbled beside him. "I'm really not sure if I can make it honestly."  
"嗯，抱歉，" 她在他旁边咕哝着。"老实说，我真的不确定我能不能做到。"

"If you're this tired, you should just go take a nap."  
"如果你这么累，你应该去小睡一会儿。"

"No, don't want to," she replied sleepily.  
"不，不想睡，" 她困倦地回答。"

Shinji frowned at her, wondering why was was being so stubborn.  
真嗣皱眉看着她，不明白她为何如此固执。

"Sorry, I just want to stay beside you right now. I don't even truthfully know why even but..."  
“对不起，我现在只想待在你身边。我甚至不知道为什么，但……”

'What am I saying,' thought Asuka. Shaking her head slowly, she tried ignoring these sudden thoughts, and asked Shinji something else instead.  
“我在说什么啊，”明日香心想。她缓缓摇头，试图忽略这些突如其来的念头，转而向真嗣问了别的问题。

"Did you plan on practicing again today?"  
"你今天打算再练习吗？"

"Well, I'd considered it, but I don't have to. Besides, you said you wanted to stay with me, so-"  
"嗯，我是有考虑过，但没必要。而且，你说过想和我待在一起，所以——"

"It's fine. You can go."  
"没关系。你去吧。"

"If I leave though, you'll just fall asleep...unless you're okay with that."  
"但如果我离开，你只会睡着...除非你不介意这样。"

"That's why I'm going as well."  
"所以我也要去。"

Shinji let that sink in for several seconds, thinking he had misheard. Asuka had known long ago about the extra time spent in the woods after cutting down trees, but even after all this time, she still hadn't gone out there with him. They had their own schedule for doing things, so it had almost never come up, but Asuka was now wanting to go. Shinji wasn't sure whether he wanted her to honestly. He had no idea what he looked like when he was so focused on his AT-field, and was a little afraid what her reaction would be.  
真嗣让这句话在脑海中沉淀了几秒钟，以为自己听错了。明日香很久以前就知道砍树后在树林里额外花的时间，但即使过了这么久，她还是没和他一起去过那里。他们各自有安排事情的时间表，所以几乎从未提起过，但明日香现在却想一起去。真嗣不确定自己是否真的希望她去。他不知道自己在全神贯注于 AT 力场时是什么样子，有点担心她的反应会是什么。

"Are you sure about that?" asked Shinji.  
“你确定吗？” 真嗣问道。

"Well, I've never been out there in the first place, and I have a better chance staying awake there then here certainly. Plus, like I said, I want to be beside you right now."  
“嗯，我本来就没去过那里，而且在那里我更有可能保持清醒，而不是在这里。再说了，就像我说的，我现在想待在你身边。”

Asuka glanced up at him, seeing the slightly worried expression on his face. Letting out a low sigh, she said, "If you're worried about me thinking you strange, you should know better by now. You should have more faith in yourself Shinji. I trust you afterall."  
明日香抬头看着他，注意到他脸上略带忧虑的表情。她轻叹一声，说道：“如果你担心我觉得你奇怪，那你现在应该更了解自己了。你应该对自己更有信心，真嗣。毕竟，我是信任你的。”

"If you insist..." "如果你坚持..."

"I do," said Asuka as she stood up. Going upstairs, she grabbed something warmer than what she was currently wearing, and came back downstairs shortly later. She was wearing a navy blue sweatshirt now along with the same color jeans. Shinji stared at her for several seconds, sudden thoughts assaulting his mind, but he pushed those away. Now wasn't the time to be participating in those things.  
"我坚持，" 明日香说着站起身来。她上楼拿了件比身上更暖和的衣服，很快就回到了楼下。现在她穿着一件深蓝色的运动衫和同色的牛仔裤。真嗣盯着她看了好几秒，脑海中突然涌现出各种念头，但他把这些念头都推开了。现在不是参与那些事情的时候。

"I'm ready whenever you are," said Asuka.  
"我随时都准备好了，" 明日香说道。

"Right," said Shinji as he nodded at her.  
“好的，”真嗣点点头对她说。

Shinji drove again since Asuka was still tired, and she spent the ride leaning against Shinji with her eyes closed, resting slightly. When he eventually turned right onto the makeshift path he had created through the tree line though, Asuka opened her eyes. She had heard multiple times about Shinji's exploration out here, but seeing what he had done after a year and a half was still surprising.  
由于明日香仍然感到疲惫，这次由真嗣开车。她一路上靠在真嗣身上，闭着眼睛稍作休息。但当他最终右转驶入他穿过树丛开辟的临时小路时，明日香睁开了眼睛。她多次听真嗣提起过这里的探险，但亲眼看到他一年半来的成果，依然感到惊讶。

The truck bounced and wove around stumps as Shinji drove slowly through the path. He was going slower than he normally did since Asuka was with him this time, and her head was darting from one window to the other. Multiple other paths began moving off in other directions as they continued driving through the forest which Shinji had created. Soon though, they broke into a large cleared out area, one of the first that he had started, and the stumps of fallen trees stretched on for many thousands of feet.  
卡车在树桩间颠簸穿行，真嗣缓慢地沿着小路行驶。这次他比平时开得更慢，因为明日香在身边，她的头不停地从一扇车窗转向另一扇。随着他们继续在真嗣开辟的森林中行驶，多条其他小路开始向不同方向延伸。不久，他们驶入了一片开阔地，这是真嗣最早开始清理的地方之一，倒下的树桩绵延数千英尺。

They didn't stop here, but kept driving further onward, starting to snake there way west. Smaller clearings passed by them, some of which Shinji had used particularly for practicing. Asuka had never thought much about the amount of firewood they had used across the time spent here, but she was surprised at how many trees Shinji had felled. Of course, not all of them were for firewood either, and here and there were some that he had cut down while practicing, the wood slowly rotting away through the seasons.  
他们并未在此停留，而是继续驱车向西前行，蜿蜒曲折地穿梭。沿途经过一些小空地，其中有些是真嗣专门用来练习的。明日香从未细想过他们在这里度过的时光中消耗了多少柴火，但她惊讶于真嗣砍倒的树木数量。当然，并非所有树木都是为了柴火，有些是他练习时砍下的，随着季节更迭，木材慢慢腐烂。

Shinji seemed to have a particular spot in mind, one of the recent places he had started working on it seemed. The path they were driving on became more narrow, the trees tightly knit together. Eventually, the broke out into a small clearing that was only around one hundred and fifty feet wide in a circle. Parking the car near the edge of the clearing, Shinji got out, and then Asuka slid out the driver side door as well. There were clouds in the sky, but it didn't look like they contained any rain, and the air was moderately warm.  
真嗣似乎心中有特定的目的地，最近他开始在那里练习。他们行驶的小径愈发狭窄，树木紧密相连。最终，他们驶入一片直径约一百五十英尺的小空地。真嗣将车停在空地边缘，下车后，明日香也从驾驶座一侧滑出。天空虽有云层，但看起来并无降雨之意，空气温度适中。

"So this is where you've been practicing lately?"  
“所以这就是你最近练习的地方？”

"Yeah, it's a newer spot, so I figured I'd bring you here."  
“是啊，这是个新地方，所以我想带你来这里。”

Walking around to the back of the truck, Shinji let the tailgate fall down so Asuka could sit there and watch while he practice. She climbed up and sat with her legs swinging over the side, and Shinji decided to sit beside her a little while. He assumed that Asuka probably had questions, and predictably, she asked him something which he had expected.  
绕到卡车后面，真嗣放下尾门，让明日香可以坐在那里看他练习。她爬上去，双腿悬在边上晃荡着坐下，真嗣决定也坐一会儿陪她。他猜明日香可能会有问题，不出所料，她问了他一个他预料中的问题。

"Can you ask you something?"  
“你能问你个问题吗？”

"Sure." "当然。"

"You've been doing this for a long while now, so what spurred this on? You never were comfortable with your abilities before, but you are a lot more accepting of them now. What changed?"  
"你已经做这件事很久了，是什么促使你这么做？你以前对自己的能力并不自在，但现在接受多了。是什么改变了你？"

Shinji didn't immediately reply to her, his gaze wandering up to the clouds above his head.  
真嗣没有立即回答她，目光飘向头顶的云朵。

"The short version is I just accepted who I am I guess. For whatever reason, I have this ability, and I can't do anything to change it, and nor can I ignore it. Back in Tokyo-2, I initially only practiced so I could learn to control it for fear of harming you, but when we arrived here, I decided that that wasn't enough. There was still so much that I didn't know, and I would be lying if I wasn't curious how far I could go with it, but their was one thing that I was aiming for."  
"简而言之，我想我刚刚接受了自己是谁。无论出于什么原因，我拥有这种能力，我无法改变它，也无法忽视它。在东京-2 时，我最初只是为了学会控制它，以免伤害到你，但当我们来到这里后，我决定这还不够。还有很多我不知道的东西，如果我不好奇自己能用它走多远，那我就是在撒谎，但有一件事是我所追求的。"

Sliding off the tailgate, Shinji walked several feet away from Asuka, and then turned towards her.  
真嗣从车尾滑下，走了几步远离明日香，然后转身面向她。

"Asuka, you've seem me using my AT-field a handful of times by now, but is their anything that ever stood out to you?"  
"明日香，你已经见过我使用 AT 力场好几次了，但有没有什么特别让你印象深刻的地方？"

"You mean like the obvious fact that you can use one?" asked Asuka with a slight smile.  
"你是说像你明显能用一个的那种事实？" 明日香带着一丝微笑问道。

Shinji chuckled lightly at that, but then said, "Well, not quite what I meant, but I guess it'd be better to just show you."  
真嗣对此轻声笑了笑，但随后说道："嗯，不完全是我所指的意思，但我想最好还是直接展示给你看。"

Taking a stance, Shinji projected his AT-field above him, sending it soaring up into the sky. Asuka watched this, but still she didn't understand what he was trying to say. When he dissipated it and turned to her however, he asked-  
真嗣摆好姿势，将他的 AT 力场投射到头顶上方，让它直冲云霄。明日香看着这一幕，但仍然不明白他想表达什么。然而，当他散去力场并转向她时，他问道——

"So, from that, was there anything that stood out to you?"  
"那么，从那里面，有没有什么让你印象深刻的东西？"

"...Not really. It was just the same as always, at least, thats the way it seemed to me. You just threw your arm out and projected it like you've always done."  
"……真的没有。一切都很平常，至少在我看来是这样。你就和平常一样伸出手臂，像往常一样施展魔法。"

"So you don't even realize it yourself even though you just mentioned it."  
"所以你自己都没意识到，尽管你刚刚才提到。"

"I...huh?" asked Asuka confused.  
"我...啊？" 明日香困惑地问。

"My arm," said Shinji simply. "In order to use my AT-field, I've always had to thrust my right arm out as if I'm actually throwing my AT-field like a baseball."  
"我的手臂，" 真嗣简单地说。"为了使用我的 AT 力场，我总是得伸出右臂，就像我真的在像投掷棒球一样投出我的 AT 力场。"

"Is this a problem?" "这有问题吗？"

"Maybe, maybe not," shrugged Shinji. "But, there is something I realized. Everything depends on myself recognizing a situation where I have to use my AT-field, and then acting on that, which requires the use of my right arm. My reaction speed is already well above that of a normal humans, but there is still that one to two second window that requires my ability to react. I then began wondering if I can eliminate this requirement all together, and begin using my AT-field subconsciously. So far, I haven't had much luck, though I have improved my control substantially."  
"或许吧，或许不吧，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"但我意识到一件事。一切都取决于我自己能否识别出需要使用 AT 力场的情境，并据此行动，这需要用到我的右臂。我的反应速度已经远超常人，但仍有一到两秒的反应窗口需要我的能力去应对。我开始思考是否能完全消除这一需求，让 AT 力场的使用变成潜意识行为。到目前为止，我虽未取得多大进展，但对 AT 力场的控制已大有提升。"

"...Why though?" asked Asuka suddenly. "Why go to all this trouble? It may not even be possible."  
"...为什么呢？" 明日香突然问道。"为什么要费这么大劲？这可能根本做不到。"

"Like I said, curiosity on my own part...but more so because I don't want the slightest possibility that something could happen to you. You're far too important to me Asuka, and I wont allow the slightest chance that something bad could happen to you because I wasn't doing my utmost to understand my own abilities."  
"就像我说的，出于我自己的好奇心...但更因为我不希望有任何可能让你受到伤害。你对我来说太重要了，明日香，我不会允许因为我不尽全力去理解自己的能力而让你遭遇任何不测。"

"...Shinji..." mumbled Asuka.  
"...真嗣..." 明日香咕哝道。

It always came back to her didn't, thought Asuka. No matter what happened, Shinji was always there for her. It just showed how much he cared for her.  
总是回到她身边，不是吗？明日香心想。无论发生什么，真嗣总是在她身边。这正显示了他有多在乎她。

"Well, like I said," muttered Shinji, scratching the back of his head, "I haven't had much success in this, and I've only recently started practicing again since last night."  
"嗯，就像我说的，" 真嗣嘟囔着，挠了挠后脑勺，"在这方面我没什么成就，而且我昨晚才开始重新练习。"

"Shinji, I-" "真嗣，我——"

"You don't have to say anything. It was my own decision anyway, and I've steadily grown to appreciate my AT-field more."  
"你什么都不用说。反正这是我自己的决定，而且我也逐渐开始更加珍惜我的 AT 力场了。"

Asuka didn't say anything. She had a feeling in the depths of her stomach, wholly unlike the one she had had at the grocery store earlier in the day. This feeling was filling her up slowly, enveloping her heart, warmth spreading to every corner of her body. This boy, no: it wasn't right to consider him a boy anymore; this young man cared about her so much. Asuka had never known that she could be cared for like this, to take all possibilities into mind and protect her. Maybe this is what she always wanted; for somebody to care for her, to protect her, to comfort her when she was sad. She had lacked this warmth for all her life until she had found it within Shinji.  
明日香没有说话。她心中有一种感觉，与今天早些时候在杂货店时的感觉完全不同。这种感觉慢慢地填满了她，包裹着她的心，温暖蔓延至全身的每一个角落。这个男孩，不：再把他当成男孩已经不合适了；这个年轻人如此关心她。明日香从未想过自己能被这样关心，考虑到所有的可能性并保护她。也许这就是她一直想要的；有人关心她，保护她，在她难过时安慰她。她一生中一直缺乏这种温暖，直到她在真嗣身上找到了它。

Truthfully, from the bottom of his heart, Shinji cared for, and loved her.  
说实话，发自内心深处，真嗣关心她，爱着她。

And Asuka fully accepted that love, for it was something that she shared as well.  
而明日香完全接受了这份爱，因为她同样也怀有这份情感。

"Asuka, you okay?" asked Shinji, wondering why she hadn't said anything for several seconds.  
“明日香，你还好吗？”真嗣问道，不明白为什么她已经好几秒没说话了。

"...Yeah, sorry," mumbled Asuka, wiping her eyes. She hadn't realized it, but she had steadily started crying silently. Shinji noticed the pearly white tears glistening on her cheeks, but he didn't comment on this. He hadn't expected his words to affect her so strongly, but they were the truth.  
"...嗯，对不起，" 明日香喃喃道，擦着眼睛。她没有意识到，但她已经默默地开始哭泣。真嗣注意到了她脸颊上闪烁的珍珠般的眼泪，但他没有对此发表评论。他没有预料到自己的话会对她产生如此强烈的影响，但那是事实。

"Well, I suppose I'll start practicing then, if thats alright with you."  
"那么，我想我开始练习了，如果你觉得可以的话。"

"Yeah, it is...and Shinji?"  
"嗯，可以...还有，真嗣？"

"...Yes?" “……嗯？”

"I...I want to ask you something else once your finished."  
"我...我想等你完成后再问你另一件事。"

"You can ask me now if you want."  
"如果你想的话，现在就可以问我。"

"No, it wouldn't be right to do so right now. It would only distract you."  
"不，现在问不合适。那样只会让你分心。"

Shinji puzzled over this for several seconds, wondering what on earth she could ask that could distract him so badly.  
真嗣对此困惑了几秒钟，不知道她究竟会问什么问题，能让他如此分心。

"If you say so...well, I probably wont take very long anyway. I'm just getting back into the groove of things right now."  
“既然你这么说……好吧，反正我也不会花太长时间。我现在只是刚刚重新适应这些事情。”

Asuka nodded, and watched as Shinji turned away from her, walking far enough away until he was standing near the center of the clearing. Her face turned slightly red as she watched him, her heart pounding in her chest. She wanted to hear it, to get a clear answer from him. She didn't care how hesitant he would be, or how nervous he would get. She wanted to clearly hear it from his own lips, but she herself had to find her own resolve as well, since she knew it couldn't be a one sided thing.  
明日香点点头，看着真嗣转身离开她，走到足够远的地方，站在空地的中央。她看着他，脸颊微微泛红，心跳在胸腔中加速。她想听到他的回答，想从他口中得到一个明确的答案。她不在乎他会多么犹豫或紧张。她想清楚地听到他亲口说出来，但她也必须找到自己的决心，因为她知道这不能只是一方面的。

She leaned against the side of the truck, watching Shinji through half closed eyes. Even though she was sitting upright, she was dozing off. She had to admit though, that there was something rather incredible about Shinji as she watched him go through what seemed familiar motions. She had never seem him using his AT-field so openly before, and when he started ascending into the air, she felt her mouth open slightly in surprise. For all his apparent disappointment about not being able to use it unconsciously, Asuka thought that he seemed able to control it easily.  
她斜靠在卡车边，半眯着眼观察着真嗣。尽管她坐得笔直，却已昏昏欲睡。不过她不得不承认，看着真嗣重复那些看似熟悉的动作，有种难以言喻的奇妙感。她从未见过他如此公开地使用 AT 力场，当他开始升空时，她惊讶得微微张开了嘴。尽管他对自己无法无意识地使用它感到失望，但明日香觉得他似乎能轻松地控制它。

Even though this was the first time Asuka was watching him, Shinji had tuned everything out except for his own thought process. He thought that he would be nervous with her watching him, but he felt oddly relaxed. He slipped into a familiar process, falling into motions which he had tried and perfected. He was soon high in the sky, looking down into the clearing, Asuka little more than a dot with her vivid red hair. Shinji felt himself smiling slightly as he looked down at her.  
尽管这是明日香第一次看他表演，真嗣却完全沉浸在自己的思绪中。他原以为她在旁边看着会让他紧张，但却感到异常放松。他进入了一个熟悉的过程，陷入了他尝试并完善的动作中。很快，他就高高飞在空中，俯视着下方的空地，明日香那鲜红的头发在视野中不过是个小点。真嗣看着她，嘴角微微上扬。

Refocusing himself, he projected his AT-field time and time again as he slowly made his way back to the ground. As he landed, he immediately projected his AT-field into a dome, covering himself in a wide field. It was a simple thing to alter his AT-field now from one thing to another without dissipating it, and he quickly changed from the dome to the simple wall. It was easy to alternate his AT-field now.  
他重新集中精神，一次又一次地投射出自己的 AT 力场，慢慢地回到地面。一落地，他立刻将自己的 AT 力场扩展成一个穹顶，覆盖在自己周围。现在，他可以轻松地将 AT 力场从一种形态转变为另一种，而不必消散它，他迅速从穹顶变换成简单的墙壁。现在，交替使用 AT 力场对他来说轻而易举。

Asuka continued watching him, marveling at his speed. Just judging by his physical body, Shinji didn't seem all that strong, but Asuka knew that he held himself back unconsciously. While in Tokyo-2, he had struggled with this, but had come to gripes with his own power and had learned to control it, but Asuka wondered how strong Shinji actually was. Could he shattered a rock just by exerting enough force through his fists? He had broken plates by accident before just by holding them, but rock and ceramic were very different materials afterall. Asuka forgot how strong Shinji was sometimes, especially considering how gentle he was towards her.  
明日香继续观察着他，对他的速度感到惊叹。仅从他的身体来看，真嗣似乎并不那么强壮，但明日香知道他无意识地有所保留。在东京-2 时，他曾为此挣扎，但最终掌握了自我力量并学会了控制，然而明日香好奇真嗣究竟有多强。他能仅凭拳头的力量击碎岩石吗？他曾无意中握碎过盘子，但岩石和陶瓷毕竟是截然不同的材料。明日香有时会忘记真嗣的力量，尤其是考虑到他对她的温柔。

As time wore on, and Shinji continued to practice, Asuka slowly felt her consciousness start to fade, and within the span of a few minutes, completely fell asleep leaning against the truck. Shinji noticed this, but paid it very little heed. He would continue practicing for a while until calling in quits. This he did, spending about another half an hour practicing until he felt he had done enough.  
随着时间的推移，真嗣继续练习，而明日香渐渐感到意识开始模糊，不出几分钟，她就完全睡着了，靠在卡车旁。真嗣注意到了这一点，但并未太在意。他会继续练习一段时间，直到决定结束。他确实这样做了，又练习了大约半小时，直到他觉得足够了。

Letting his AT-field vanish, he walked back to the truck, stopping when he stood in front of Asuka. She was sleeping peacefully, and Shinji didn't want to wake her just yet, so he carefully hopped onto the tailgate, and sat beside her.  
他让 AT 力场消失，走回卡车前，停在明日香面前。她正安详地睡着，真嗣不想现在就叫醒她，于是他小心翼翼地跳上尾板，坐在她旁边。

Shinji began thinking about things as he looked up to the sky, remembering his dream from yesterday. The future was a mystery, but no matter what happened, he wanted Asuka to be there beside him. Without her, he would have sunken into a depression of misery and anger thanks to his other self, but she had saved him from that. She never questioned his humanity, who he was, or whether he should even exist on this earth. Nobody had ever cared for him before, and he had spent his life prior to this being shuffled around like a piece of baggage. Asuka had turned all that aside with her actions and words.  
真嗣抬头望着天空，开始思考一些事情，回忆起昨天的梦。未来是个谜，但无论发生什么，他都希望明日香能陪在他身边。没有她，他可能早已因另一个自己而陷入痛苦和愤怒的抑郁之中，但她救了他。她从未质疑过他的人性、他的身份，或他是否应该存在于这个世界上。以前从没有人关心过他，他一直像一件行李一样被推来推去。明日香用她的行动和话语改变了这一切。

Shinji had never understood what love was, and even now, he had difficulty grasping the concept, but if just being around somebody you cared for made you happy, perhaps that was enough. Even just thinking about her brought a warm feeling to his heart. It was a long while coming, but it sometimes felt like it was always meant to happen for some reason, as illogical as that sounded.  
真嗣从未理解过什么是爱，即使现在，他也难以把握这个概念，但如果仅仅是陪伴在你关心的人身边就能让你感到快乐，或许这就足够了。仅仅是想到她，他的心中就涌起一股暖意。虽然这花了很长时间，但有时感觉这似乎是命中注定的事情，尽管这听起来不合逻辑。

"Sometimes I even wonder how I came to love her," mumbled Shinji to himself. He didn't know where or when it had happened, but somewhere along the way, he had grown attached to her. Well, maybe that was another strange thing about love, but Shinji wasn't sure.  
“有时候我甚至会想，我是怎么爱上她的，”真嗣喃喃自语。他不知道这一切是在何时何地发生的，但不知不觉中，他已经对她产生了依恋。或许，这就是爱情的另一奇妙之处，但真嗣并不确定。

"Guess I should wake her. The sun is starting to set I think," he sighed, and turned towards her.  
“我想我该叫醒她了。太阳似乎开始落山了，”他叹了口气，转向她。

He turned towards her, but received a shock in seeing that she was awake, her eyes staring unwavering back at him, any sign of sleepiness driven from her.  
他转向她，却惊讶地发现她已经醒了，双眼坚定地回望着他，丝毫不见睡意。

"...Asuka...um..." "...明日香...呃..."

She quickly looked away from him, her face briefly turning pink. Shinji swore within his mind, cursing himself for being so lax in assuming she was asleep. He was both thinking and speaking his mind while hardly even thinking that Asuka might hear him, but what's done is done.  
她迅速从他身上移开视线，脸颊短暂地泛起红晕。真嗣在心中咒骂自己，责怪自己过于松懈，以为她还在熟睡。他一边思考一边自言自语，几乎没考虑到明日香可能会听到，但事已至此。

"...Asuka?" "...明日香？"

She didn't say anything, but jumped off the tailgate, marching around the side of the truck before yanking the door open, and then slamming it suddenly. Shinji continued sitting there, as it slowly sank in what had just happened.  
她什么也没说，只是从车尾跳下，大步绕到卡车侧面，猛地拉开一扇门，然后突然砰地一声关上。真嗣继续坐在那里，慢慢地意识到刚刚发生了什么。

"Guess I fucked up," he muttered angrily to himself.  
“看来我搞砸了，”他生气地自言自语道。

---

The drive back was uneventful and awkward. Shinji didn't even bother to ask whether Asuka had heard what he had said; her actions were enough to know that she had.  
回去的路上既平淡又尴尬。真嗣甚至懒得问明日香是否听到了他说的话；她的举动已经足以说明她听到了。

When Shinji pulled into the driveway, Asuka quickly jumped out of the cab, and then hurriedly walked around the house to the sliding door, wrenching it open and disappeared upstairs before Shinji had even entered the house. Swearing at his stupidity even further, Shinji languished on the couch, rebuking himself for his words. He wasn't even sure whether Asuka was fuming mad at him, or just embarrassed. He suspected angry, and he couldn't really blame her, especially considering how she had heard it.  
当真嗣驶入车道时，明日香迅速跳出出租车，然后急匆匆地绕过房子来到滑动门前，猛地拉开并消失在楼上，甚至比真嗣进屋还要快。他咒骂自己的愚蠢，颓然倒在沙发上，责备自己的言辞。他甚至不确定明日香是对他大发雷霆，还是仅仅感到尴尬。他猜是生气，而且他真的不能怪她，尤其是考虑到她听到的那番话。

He tried reading a book, but kept thinking about what he had said, getting so angry at himself that he nearly threw the book into the fireplace. He knew what he had to do, but it didn't make it any easier. It was getting close to dinner, but he'd have to put that on hold for now.  
他试图读一本书，但满脑子都是自己说过的话，越想越气，差点把书扔进壁炉。他知道自己该做什么，但这并没有让事情变得更容易。晚餐时间临近，但他现在只能先搁置。

Finally making his decision, he left the couch and slowly began making his way upstairs. The bedroom door was closed, and Shinji hesitate for a few seconds before he finally pushed it open. Asuka was in bed, the sheets pulled over her head, and her face pressed against the pillow. Shinji wouldn't even know she was there except for the distinct lump that signified her.  
最终下定决心，他离开沙发，缓缓走上楼。卧室门紧闭，真嗣犹豫了几秒，终于推开门。明日香躺在床上，被单蒙着头，脸紧贴着枕头。要不是那个明显的隆起，真嗣甚至不会知道她在那里。

Sitting down on the edge of the bed, he felt her shift slightly, so at least she wasn't asleep, but whether she would actually listen to him was a different story altogether.  
他坐在床边，感觉到她微微动了动，至少她还没睡着，但她是否真的会听他说，那就是另一回事了。

"...Asuka, I'm sorry for what I said earlier. I shouldn't have said it like that. I was thinking about a bunch of different things, and it sorta just came out. I can understand if you're angry at me, and I don't blame you."  
“...明日香，我为之前说的话道歉。我不该那样说的。我当时在想很多事情，话就那么脱口而出了。如果你生我的气，我能理解，我也不怪你。”

He didn't get a reply from her, which he didn't really expect, not yet at least, but he continued talking.  
他没有得到她的回应，这并不出乎意料，至少现在还没有，但他继续说着。

"It's hard for me to imagine that two years have gone by; it honestly feels like I just met you yesterday, but I know this isn't true, because I can recall all the memories that I have of you over these past two years. We've shared a lot, both happy, and sad things. Whenever one would be down, the other would try to console them. It's impossible to count the number of times you've helped me through difficult moments Asuka, especially when I was doubting my own existence, and whether I should have even been alive or not. I think I'd be a different person if not for you."  
"很难想象两年已经过去了；说实话，感觉就像昨天才遇见你，但我知道这不是真的，因为我能回忆起这两年来关于你的所有记忆。我们分享了很多，有快乐的，也有悲伤的。每当一方情绪低落时，另一方总会试图安慰。你帮助我度过难关的次数多得数不清，Asuka，尤其是在我怀疑自己存在的意义，甚至怀疑自己是否应该活着的时候。我想，如果没有你，我会是另一个人。"

Placing his arms behind him, he leaned back, letting his arms supported his weight, his eyes looking up at the ceiling while he continued talking.  
他将双臂放在身后，向后仰靠，让手臂支撑着他的重量，眼睛望着天花板，继续说着话。

"...Truthfully, I don't know when I started having feelings for you," Shinji started. "Maybe it had been that very moment when I saw you lying on the beach, wondering who you were. I felt drawn to you in some sense I think, but I can't explain it. Sometimes it seems like things were meant to happen in this way, and we never actually had any say in the matter, but even if this were true, I would be happy. For a long while now, there hasn't been a day that hasn't gone by where I'm not thinking about you."  
"...老实说，我不确定自己是从何时开始对你产生感情的，" 真嗣开口道。"或许就是在那一天，我看到你躺在沙滩上，好奇你是谁的那一刻。我感到某种莫名的吸引，虽然无法解释。有时候，事情似乎注定要这样发生，我们从未真正有过选择，但即便如此，我也会感到幸福。很长一段时间以来，没有一天我不曾思念你。"

Shinji thought he heard a sharp inhale of breath come from Asuka buried under the covers, but he continued on.  
真嗣以为他听到被子里传来明日香急促的吸气声，但他继续说下去。

"Steadily, I've begun to want you more and more with each passing day. Every time we kiss, or hold each other, it feels like a part of my brain is crumbling away. Sometimes I ask myself, 'is this right? Is this really okay to be doing this with her? Does she deserve better than me?' I still second guess myself sometimes, wondering if what I'm doing is really right, because of who I am. In the end though, my feelings for you win out. I couldn't lose you, not now, not ever. Every morning when I wake up, and see your peaceful face beside me, I can't help but feel a pain in my heart, urging me to speak my feelings. I always ignored it though, telling myself there was always a next time."  
渐渐地，我发现自己每一天都越来越渴望你。每一次我们亲吻，或拥抱，都感觉像是大脑的一部分在崩解。有时我会问自己，“这样对吗？和她这样真的好吗？她是否值得比我更好的人？”我有时仍会自我怀疑，想知道我所做的是否真的正确，因为我是谁。但最终，我对你的感情胜出。我不能失去你，现在不能，永远不能。每天早晨醒来，看到你安详的面庞，我心中不禁涌起一阵痛楚，催促我表达心意。然而，我总是忽略它，告诉自己总会有下一次。

"I've said it to you before Asuka, but you're beautiful. I'll admit that when I first met you, I wasn't very sure what to make of you since you were so guarded, but as I slowly got to know you better, I gradually started to care for you more. That feeling began blossoming into something more, and very slowly, I started to believe what it was, even though I had never felt it before. It's still difficult for me to describe it, or even put into words, but the feeling I have when I'm kissing you, holding you, or just being beside you, makes me happy. If thats the truth behind this emotion, than I'm fine with that."  
"我之前已经对你说过，明日香，但你真的很美。我承认，第一次遇见你时，我并不太确定该如何看待你，因为你如此戒备森严，但随着我逐渐了解你，我开始更加关心你。那种感觉开始绽放成更深的东西，尽管我以前从未有过这种感觉，但我开始慢慢相信它是什么。我仍然难以描述它，甚至难以用言语表达，但当我亲吻你、拥抱你，或只是在你身边时，那种感觉让我感到快乐。如果这就是这种情感背后的真相，那么我对此感到满意。"

Glancing towards where her face was covered, Shinji began slowly crawling across the bed. He felt her body start to twitch under the covers, and thought that she might be preparing to escape the bedroom, but he was careful in covering her with his body so she couldn't do this. He pressed his body against hers now, his face nearing hers. Her hands were holding the sheets over her head, but Shinji placed his own hands over hers, and then gently removed them from the corners of the sheet, moving it away.

He was now looking into Asuka's eyes, face to face with her. Her face was dyed crimson, something which he hadn't expected, but he wasn't about to stop. He needed to right the wrong he had committed earlier.  
他现在正凝视着明日香的眼睛，与她面对面。她的脸颊染上了绯红，这是他未曾预料到的，但他并未打算就此停下。他需要纠正之前犯下的错误。

He stared at her for several seconds, watching her eyes closely. They were wavering, and Shinji thought he saw a slight wetness on her cheek. He wasn't sure whether she had been crying because of what he had said earlier, or just a few seconds ago. Either way, he felt bad about it. He didn't want to see her crying, he wanted to see her happy and glad to be alive, to be living with him.  
他盯着她看了好几秒，仔细观察她的眼睛。它们在颤动，真嗣觉得他看到了她脸颊上微微的湿润。他不确信她是因为他之前说的话而哭泣，还是就在刚刚。无论哪种情况，他都感到内疚。他不想看到她哭泣，他想看到她快乐，庆幸自己还活着，与他一起生活。

Slowly opening his mouth, Shinji spoke directly to her.  
真嗣缓缓张开嘴，直接对她说道。

"Asuka...I don't think I could ever spend my life with anybody else. The feelings that steadily developed and the memories I have of our time growing together, I will forever cherish. However long we continued this shared existence, I want you to know that-"  
"明日香...我想我无法与其他任何人共度此生。那些逐渐滋生的情感和我们共同成长的记忆，我将永远珍视。无论我们这段共存的日子持续多久，我都希望你知道——"

"I love you." "我爱你。"

With these three words spoken, Shinji pressed his lips against hers.  
随着这三个字的说出，真嗣将他的唇贴上了她的。

It was a quick kiss, over in seconds as Shinji had intended it to be, and Asuka hadn't even reacted in the first place. Her mind was still churning over what Shinji had said, and both her eyes were glazed over, not seeing him.  
那是一个迅速的吻，正如碇真嗣所预期的那样，几秒钟就结束了，而明日香甚至一开始都没有反应过来。她的思绪仍在翻腾，想着真嗣说过的话，双眼茫然，没有看向他。

Shinji watched her for several seconds, his face slightly red. It had felt a bit embarrassing to say it, but it was how he felt. He loved her afterall.  
真嗣注视了她几秒钟，脸颊微微泛红。说出那番话让他感到有些尴尬，但那是他的真实感受。毕竟，他是爱她的。

When Asuka still wasn't talking, or moving for that matter, Shinji began shaking her gently.  
当明日香仍然沉默不语，甚至一动不动时，真嗣开始轻轻地摇晃她。

"Asuka? Hey, you okay? Come on, this shouldn't have come as that big of a surprise, and besides, you already heard me say it before."  
“明日香？嘿，你还好吗？来吧，这应该不至于让你这么惊讶，而且，你之前已经听我说过了。”

Slowly, her eyes finally started focusing on him. Before Shinji was able to say anything else to her though, Asuka leaned forward, pressing her lips against his strongly. She pushed him backwards onto the bed, falling on top of him. She was melting into his lips, responding to his words with her actions. She received his feelings, and then responded in turn with hers.  
渐渐地，她的眼睛终于开始聚焦在他身上。然而，在真嗣能对她说些什么之前，明日香向前倾身，用力地吻上了他的唇。她将他推倒在床上，自己则压在他身上。她沉浸在他的唇间，用行动回应他的话语。她接受了他的感情，然后用她的方式回应。

Pulling away from him, Asuka stared down at Shinji, her eyes focused on him.  
离开他的唇，明日香低头凝视着真嗣，目光紧紧锁定在他身上。

"...Can you say it again?" she asked quietly.  
"...你能再说一遍吗？" 她轻声问道。

It had been the first time she had spoken to him since before she had fallen asleep sitting on the tailgate of the truck, and Shinji was glad that he could hear her voice again. He responded to her wishes.  
这是自她坐在卡车后挡板上睡着以来第一次和他说话，真嗣很高兴能再次听到她的声音。他回应了她的愿望。

"...I love you..." "...我爱你..."

Asuka pressed her lips against his, kissing him again, entwining her tongue with his.  
明日香将她的唇紧贴在他的唇上，再次与他亲吻，两人的舌头缠绵交织。

"Again," she said, mumbling the words as she kissed him.  
“再一次，”她说道，含糊地吐出这几个字，同时继续亲吻他。

"Asuka, I love you," he responded while still kissing her.  
“明日香，我爱你，”他回应道，尽管仍在亲吻她。

She smiled upon hearing her own name before those three words, letting the sound ring in her ear. She liked the way it sounded. Yes, Shinji loved her. How long, even he didn't know, but he loved her. Asuka felt elated as she repeated the words over and over in her mind. She felt like a young girl who had just discovered her first crush liked her as well. Asuka could no longer contain herself, her lips forming a wide smile and she beamed from ear to ear; she hadn't felt this happy in a long time.  
听到自己的名字在那些话语之前，她微笑了，让这声音在耳边回响。她喜欢这听起来感觉。是的，真嗣爱她。连他自己也不清楚有多久，但他爱她。明日香感到无比喜悦，一遍遍在心中重复这些话。她觉得自己像是一个刚刚发现初恋对象也喜欢自己的小女孩。明日香再也无法抑制自己，嘴角绽放出灿烂的笑容，她笑得合不拢嘴；她已经很久没有这么开心过了。

"So you love me?" asked Asuka suddenly.  
“所以你爱我？”明日香突然问道。

"I do," nodded Shinji. “是的，”真嗣点头道。

Asuka kissed him again, and then bounded off his chest, turning away from him. She was highly emotional right not, her entire body warm from the inside out. She couldn't help but feel excited, and had difficulties not smiling. She hadn't thought that hearing him say this to her could have such a strong affect, but it did.  
明日香再次吻了他，然后从他胸前跳开，转过身去。她此刻情绪异常激动，全身由内而外散发着温暖。她忍不住感到兴奋，难以抑制笑容。她没想到他这样对她说会产生如此强烈的影响，但确实如此。

"So, would dinner be suitable about now?" asked Shinji, still laying on the bed.  
“那么，现在吃晚饭合适吗？”真嗣躺在床上问道。

"Hmm, it would," nodded Asuka happily, turning back towards him, a wide smile still on her lips.  
“嗯，可以，”明日香开心地点头，转回身面向他，嘴角依然挂着灿烂的笑容。

Shinji was glad that she was so happy, and kissed her quickly before leaving the bedroom. They would have plenty more to talk about later, but right now they both needed to eat, and Shinji still planned on cooking a large dinner.  
真嗣很高兴她如此开心，迅速吻了她一下才离开卧室。他们之后还有很多话要谈，但眼下两人都需要吃点东西，而真嗣仍打算做一顿丰盛的晚餐。

When he left though, Asuka remained sitting on the bed, still smiling. As time continued on though, the smile slowly began to fall, as she started thinking about herself. Shinji had spoken his feelings, and so now realistically, it was Asuka's turn. Shinji had bared everything to her though, so if he could do it, Asuka knew that she could.  
然而当他离开时，明日香依旧坐在床上，依然面带微笑。但随着时间的推移，笑容渐渐消失，她开始思考自己。真嗣已经表达了他的感情，所以现在从现实角度看，轮到明日香了。真嗣向她敞开了心扉，既然他能做到，明日香知道她也可以。

It wasn't just that though. Asuka still remembered what she had grabbed at the store earlier that day, and it was beginning to weigh heavily on her mind again. What did she want? She wanted Shinji's love, but it wasn't just that. She wanted the feeling shared between two people deeply in love as they committed themselves to each other. She wanted that unique bond that was shared between a man and a woman as they made love.  
不仅如此，明日香还记得那天早些时候在商店里拿的东西，它又开始沉重地压在她的心头。她想要什么？她想要真嗣的爱，但这不仅仅是爱。她想要两个深爱的人在彼此承诺时分享的那种感觉。她想要一个男人和一个女人在相爱时分享的那种独特的纽带。

'I want to know that feeling,' thought Asuka.  
'我想体验那种感觉，'明日香心想。

---

It was almost dark out by the time Shinji finished making dinner, and he hadn't seen Asuka since he had confessed his love to her, but he was fine with this. He was sure she had her own things to set in order before she could talk, and it wasn't like they were in any rush.  
当真嗣做好晚饭时，天色已近昏暗，自他向明日香表白后，他还没见过她，但他对此并不介意。他确信她有自己的事情需要整理，才能开口交谈，而且他们也不急于一时。

The candles were lit on the dining table, the food was ready, and the silverware and plates were set on the table. Feeling satisfied with the atmosphere, Shinji walked along the hardwood floor to the bottom of the staircase and then called Asuka's name.  
餐桌上的蜡烛已经点燃，食物准备就绪，银器和餐盘也已摆放妥当。对这氛围感到满意，真嗣沿着硬木地板走到楼梯底部，然后呼唤明日香的名字。

"Hey, Asuka!? Dinner is ready!"  
"嘿，明日香！晚餐准备好了！"

"Okay," he heard her reply several seconds later.  
"好的，"几秒钟后，他听到了她的回答。

Returning to the dining room, Shinji started serving the food, and then looked up when Asuka entered. She glanced at him, giving him a nervous smile before seating herself at the table. Looking at the food, she knew that Shinji had pulled out all the stops to make this dinner a unique one. The food tasted great as usual, but Asuka couldn't help but not feel very hungry. She was distracted, her mind wandering to the bedroom where she had been for the past two hours.  
回到餐厅，真嗣开始上菜，随后抬头看见明日香走了进来。她瞥了他一眼，露出了一个紧张的微笑，然后坐到了桌前。看着这些菜肴，她知道真嗣为了这顿晚餐费尽了心思。食物一如既往地美味，但明日香却怎么也提不起食欲。她的思绪被分散了，脑海中不断浮现出过去两个小时她在卧室里的情景。

"Asuka, you okay? You're hardly eating anything. Is something wrong with the food?"  
"明日香，你还好吗？你几乎没吃什么东西。是食物有什么问题吗？"

"No, it tastes great as usual...sorry, I've just got other things on my mind right now."  
"没有，和往常一样好吃……抱歉，我只是现在有些别的事情在心上。"

Shinji what she likely meant, and didn't press the subject any further. However long it took Asuka, he could wait.  
真嗣理解她可能的意思，没有再追问下去。无论需要多久，他都可以等待。

A short while later, Asuka left, apologizing to Shinji even though he had cooked all this food, and then returned upstairs. Shinji wondered what her mind was thinking of, or what she had been doing up there all this time, but he didn't press her.  
不久后，明日香离开了，尽管是真嗣做了这么多食物，她还是向真嗣道歉，然后回到了楼上。真嗣不知道她在想什么，或者她在楼上这段时间做了什么，但他没有追问。

Finishing his own dinner, he wrapped Asuka's half finished plate, and left it on the counter for now. It was possible that she would be hungry later, so he'd leave it out for now. Next he started wrapping all the surplus food he had cooked, storing it away. He had probably made too much now that he looked back on it, but he had been on cloud nine since confessing to Asuka, so you couldn't exactly blame him.  
吃完自己的晚餐后，他将明日香未吃完的盘子包好，暂时放在柜台上。她可能晚些时候会饿，所以他暂时先放着。接着，他开始打包所有多余的食物，储存起来。现在回想起来，他可能做得太多了，但他自从向明日香表白后一直心情愉悦，所以也不能完全怪他。

After cleaning both the dining table, kitchen, and washing the plates and dishes, Shinji blew out all the candles downstairs, and then began walking upstairs. The bedroom door was ajar, and Shinji could see the faint flicker of candlelight bouncing off the door. Pushing it open, he saw that Asuka was sitting upright in bed, her hands clasped in her lap, obviously waiting for him. All four candles that they kept in their bedroom were let, lighting up the room so that they could see even in total darkness.  
清理完餐桌、厨房，洗好盘子和餐具后，真嗣吹灭了楼下的所有蜡烛，然后开始上楼。卧室的门半开着，真嗣可以看到门上反射的微弱烛光。推开门，他看到明日香正笔直地坐在床上，双手叠放在腿上，显然是在等他。他们卧室里的四根蜡烛都点燃了，照亮了房间，即使在完全黑暗中也能看得清楚。

Asuka looked up when Shinji entered, her eyes gazing into his, the candlelight highlighting her features. Shinji wasn't sure what this odd feeling was that he was getting, but he slowly approached her, before pressing his lips against hers, kissing her gently.  
当真嗣走进房间时，明日香抬头望向他，目光深邃，烛光映衬着她的面容。真嗣不确定这种奇怪的感觉是什么，但他缓缓走向她，然后轻轻地吻上了她的唇。

He cupped her face, kissing her tenderly, showing his love for her. He slowly pushed her down onto the bed, pressing his body against hers. They started kissing more deeply, their tongues swirling around one another, and Asuka wrapped her arms around Shinji's back. She wanted her mind calm just for right now, but found that her thoughts were starting to drift. She had to keep herself sane, at least for a while.  
他捧着她的脸，温柔地吻着她，表达着对她的爱意。他慢慢将她推倒在床上，身体紧贴着她。他们的吻变得更加深沉，舌头交缠在一起，明日香则环抱住真嗣的背。她只想让此刻的思绪平静下来，却发现自己的思绪开始飘散。她必须保持理智，至少暂时如此。

Shinji seemed to be doing his utmost to mess this up however, even if it wasn't intentional. His hands slowly found there way to her breasts, and he began massaging them. Asuka bit down on her lips, doing her utmost to keep her mind within reason. She had things she wanted to say, things that she needed to say, so she had to keep herself calm until then. As they continued kissing however, Asuka's reasoning slowly started slipping away, and before she wholly started drowning in this passion, she had to talk to Shinji.  
然而，真嗣似乎在尽力搞砸这一切，尽管这并非他的本意。他的手慢慢移向她的胸部，开始按摩。明日香咬紧嘴唇，竭力让自己的思绪保持理智。她有些话想说，有些话必须说，所以她必须保持冷静直到那时。但随着他们继续亲吻，明日香的理智逐渐开始消散，在她完全沉溺于这份激情之前，她必须和真嗣谈谈。

Placing her hands on his shoulders, she gently pushed him away, and then sat up on the bed beside him.  
她将双手搭在他的肩上，温柔地推开他，随后坐到了他旁边的床上。

"Asuka?" wondered Shinji.  
"明日香？" 真嗣疑惑道。

"Sorry, but if we continue, I won't be able to hold back any longer, so before that, I want to talk a bit."  
“对不起，但如果我们继续下去，我恐怕无法再克制自己了，所以在那之前，我想先聊一聊。”

"...Okay," Shinji nodded.  
“……好吧，”真嗣点头道。

Asuka didn't immediately start talking, her eyes watching the candlelight flickering on the dresser across from where she sat on the bed. She had so many things that were floating around that it was impossible to categorize them all. Be that as it may, she still needed to communicate her feelings to him.  
明日香并没有立刻开始说话，她的眼睛注视着对面梳妆台上摇曳的烛光。她心中有太多纷乱的思绪，难以一一归类。尽管如此，她仍然需要向他表达自己的感受。

"Shinji...I suppose I should first say how much I appreciated your words earlier; they meant a lot to me. Honestly, I'd been hoping to hear them for a while, and always wondered whenever we kissed if it would happen during that time. Even in the truck, I was waiting for you to tell me, but I can also imagine how difficult it was to say."  
“真嗣...我想我应该先说，我非常感激你之前的话；它们对我意义重大。老实说，我一直期待能听到这些，每次我们接吻时，我都会想是否会在那时发生。即使在卡车上，我也在等你告诉我，但我也能想象那有多难说出口。”

Taking a deep breath, Asuka continued.  
深吸一口气，明日香继续说道。

"My life before meeting you was something I thought impossible to change. I had my pride as an Evangelion pilot, my knowledge that I was superior in all ways compared to kids my age, but where did that get me eventually? Sure, I was special, one of the few chosen that could become an Evangelion pilot, but ultimately, I was betraying myself in believing that was what I wanted. Like you Shinji, I had rough childhood. My father neglected and abused me, I lost my mother at a young age, and eventually started closing myself off to others around me. Truthfully, I just wanted somebody to care about me, but because of the walls I built up around my heart, it grew more difficult to accept others."  
遇见你之前的生活，我曾以为无法改变。身为 EVA 驾驶员的骄傲，自认在各方面都优于同龄人的认知，最终又带给了我什么？没错，我是特别的，是被选中的少数能成为 EVA 驾驶员的人之一，但归根结底，我是在自欺欺人，以为那是我所渴望的。就像你，真嗣，我的童年也充满坎坷。父亲忽视和虐待我，年幼时便失去了母亲，渐渐地我开始封闭自己，拒绝与周围人交流。实际上，我只是渴望有人关心我，但由于我内心筑起的壁垒，接纳他人变得越来越难。

"When I first woke up, and saw you laying a short distance away from me, my immediate thought was, 'who the fuck is this?' I wont bother talking about what happened directly afterwards, but as the days wore on, I had to start relying on you more and more. You could have refused me, or rebuked me, but you always soldiered on, dealing with my abrasive, stubborn self. I didn't believe that another human, a boy not to mention, could care about my wellbeing without having an ulterior motive. Thats how it was at my university, so why should it be any different out in the real world?"  
"当我第一次醒来，看到你躺在我不远处时，我的第一反应是，‘这他妈是谁？’我就不赘述之后发生的事了，但随着时间的推移，我不得不越来越依赖你。你本可以拒绝我，或者斥责我，但你总是坚持下去，忍受我那粗鲁又固执的个性。我不相信会有另一个男人，更别说是男孩，会关心我的福祉而没有其他动机。在我的大学里就是这样，所以在现实世界中又怎么会不同呢？"

"Of course, you betrayed all me expectations, and while I was always snappy with you, deep down, I think I started to care about you more. You showed me a kindness that I had never experienced before in my life, awkward as you were at times, but it was endearing in an odd way. You were like me, stumbling through life, unsure about yourself, but you also had a strange stubborn willpower that I steadily grew attracted towards. You were always the one that was pushing us forward, always considering what was best for us."  
"当然，你颠覆了我所有的预期，尽管我总是对你急躁，但内心深处，我想我开始更加关心你了。你向我展示了我在生活中从未体验过的善意，尽管你有时笨拙，但这种笨拙却以一种奇怪的方式显得可爱。你和我一样，在生活中跌跌撞撞，对自己不确定，但你也有一种奇怪的固执意志力，我逐渐被它吸引。你总是推动我们前进的那个人，总是考虑什么对我们最好。"

"Like you, I don't know exactly when I started having feelings for you, but it steadily started growing stronger. During the winter in Tokyo-2, I came to terms with it, even if I still didn't fully understand it, but I feel like I do a little better now."  
"和你一样，我不确定何时开始对你产生了感情，但它逐渐变得越来越强烈。在东京-2 的冬天，我接受了这份感情，尽管当时我并未完全理解，但现在我感觉自己更明白了些。"

Turning towards Shinji, she slowly took her hand, and placed it in his, entwining her fingers with his, clasping his hand. She stared into his eyes, those brown eyes that loved her dearly, and felt a small smile appear on her face. Holding his hand, she brought it close to her chest, place it between her breasts at the center of her chest.  
她转向真嗣，慢慢地伸出手，放在他的手上，手指交缠，紧握着他的手。她凝视着他的眼睛，那双深爱着她的棕色眼眸，脸上浮现出一丝微笑。她握着他的手，贴近自己的胸口，放在胸前的正中央。

"Can you feel it?" asked Asuka as she looked at Shinji. "Can you feel the beating of my heart?"  
"你能感觉到吗？" 明日香看着真嗣问道，"你能感觉到我的心跳吗？"

Shinji didn't say anything, continuing to stare back at her, but Asuka didn't think he would reply. She was sure that he could feel it anyway.  
真嗣没有说话，继续盯着她，但明日香认为他不会回答。她确信他无论如何都能感受到。

"Every time I'm with you, I feel elate. My pulse quickens, my body grows hot, and my mind shuts off. Just being near you is enough to make my heart beat faster. This body that you've saved more than once, and not just in a physical sense, is not just mine, but yours as well Shinji. I want to share this with you, I want to know what it means to be connected to another human, and I want you to know how I feel."  
“每次和你在一起，我都感到无比喜悦。我的心跳加速，身体发热，思绪停滞。仅仅靠近你就能让我的心跳得更快。这个你不止一次救过的身体，不仅仅是我的，也是你的，真嗣。我想与你分享这一切，我想知道与另一个人相连意味着什么，我想让你知道我的感受。”

"Shinji, you've spoken about the future recently, and I don't know what it entails, but I do know that we'll be together, and thats all that matters to me. Whatever happens, whatever hardships we may face, whatever happiness or sadness that we may share from this moment onward, I want you to know from now, until the ending of this existence that we've shared, that I'll forever and always love you."  
“真嗣，你最近谈到了未来，虽然我不知道那意味着什么，但我知道我们会在一起，这对我来说就是最重要的。无论发生什么，无论我们可能面临什么困难，无论我们从此刻起可能分享的快乐或悲伤，我想让你从现在开始，直到我们共享的存在的终结，知道我将永远爱你。”

"I love you, Shinji." "我爱你，真嗣。"

Nearing the end of this, Asuka had silently started shedding tears, and Shinji couldn't do anything except watch, waiting for her to finish speaking. When she finished talking however, he moved close to her, wrapping her arms around her, and drawing her close to him.  
接近尾声时，明日香默默地开始流泪，真嗣除了静静观看，等待她说完，别无他法。然而，当她结束讲话后，他靠近她，用双臂环绕着她，将她紧紧拥入怀中。

"I love you," Asuka repeated again, her face pressed against his collarbone, ignoring the tears that were falling on his shoulder.  
"我爱你，"明日香再次重复，她的脸紧贴着他的锁骨，无视滴落在肩膀上的泪水。

"...Asuka, thank you," Shinji whispered to her.  
“...Asuka，谢谢你，”真嗣低声对她说。

Asuka hiccuped, but felt a small smile appear on her lips. She hadn't ever doubted it, but it still felt relieving to speak her feelings after having them bottled up for so long.  
Asuka 打了个嗝，但嘴角还是浮现出一丝微笑。她从未怀疑过这一点，但经过这么长时间的感情压抑后，能够表达出来依然让她感到释然。

Leaning away from Shinji, she wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her shirt, trying to calm herself down. When she was done, she stared back into Shinji's eyes, wondering whether she should just straight up ask him, but before she was given this opportunity, Shinji pressed his lips against hers. It seemed that he couldn't hold himself back any longer, and Asuka was happy to embrace him.  
她从真嗣身边退开，用衬衫袖子擦了擦眼睛，试图让自己平静下来。完成后，她再次凝视着真嗣的眼睛，犹豫是否应该直接问他，但还没等她有机会，真嗣已经吻上了她的唇。看来他已经无法再克制自己，而 Asuka 也很高兴地拥抱着他。

They fell into each other arms, kissing each other deeply, their love for each other spreading to each others body as their lips pressed against one another. Shinji had never known such a pleasant feeling filling his insides, knowing that Asuka loved him dearly. He was her important existence, as she was to him.  
他们紧紧相拥，深情拥吻，彼此的爱意随着唇瓣的相触传递到对方的身体。真嗣从未体验过如此美妙的感觉充盈内心，深知明日香深爱着他。他是她重要的存在，正如她对他一样。

**(A/N: Sexual interaction, and intercourse. Bold lettering in next four pages around.)  
(注：涉及性行为及性交。接下来四页中将以粗体标示。)**

While they continued to kiss, their arousal started to heighten. Asuka could feel Shinji's thing pressing against her leg, and her own underwear was steadily growing more moist. Letting his desires take over, Shinji's hands slipped inside Asuka's shirt, cupping her breasts softly. A low moan escaped her lips before being quickly silenced by Shinji. She wanted more than this however; just having him touch her breasts was no longer enough.  
当他们继续亲吻时，欲望逐渐高涨。明日香能感觉到真嗣的坚挺抵在她的腿上，而自己的内裤也逐渐变得湿润。真嗣任由欲望驱使，双手滑入明日香的衬衫，轻柔地握住她的乳房。她发出一声低吟，随即被真嗣迅速吻住。然而，她想要的远不止这些；仅是触摸她的乳房已不再满足她的渴望。

Sitting up quickly, Asuka pulled her shirt over her head, and then did the same for Shinji. Wrapping their arms around each other, they held one another while Asuka sat in Shinji's lap. Asuka began moving her hips, grinding against Shinji's groin, watching the pained expressions rapidly appearing on his face. She kissed him again, pressing her lips against his, smothering him with her love. The spot between her legs was beginning to throb painfully again, and she was very close to pulling off her pants as well.  
阿斯卡迅速坐起身，拉起自己的衬衫套过头，接着也为真嗣做同样的事。他们紧紧相拥，阿斯卡坐在真嗣的腿上，开始扭动臀部，摩擦着真嗣的胯部，观察他脸上迅速出现的痛苦表情。她再次亲吻他，将双唇紧贴在他唇上，用她的爱意将他淹没。她双腿间的那处又开始隐隐作痛，她几乎要忍不住脱下裤子。

Shinji began attacking her breasts again, pushing her white bra down, revealing the soft flesh and her pink nipples. He fondled them, pinched her erect nipples, and wrapped his lips around them. Asuka cradled his head as he did this, her body shivering with pleasure. Her nipples were sensitive, and Shinji had done this enough times to know what he was doing. His tongue rolled around the protrusion, sucking on it one second, and then licking it gently. When he carefully bit down on it, Asuka's whole body gave a sudden jerk, and the spot between her legs steadily grew whetter.  
真嗣再次开始攻击她的胸部，将她的白色胸罩推下，露出柔软的肌肤和粉红色的乳头。他抚弄着它们，捏住她挺立的乳头，并用嘴唇包裹住。阿斯卡抱着他的头，身体因快感而颤抖。她的乳头很敏感，而真嗣已经做过足够多次，知道该怎么做。他的舌头环绕着凸起，时而吸吮，时而轻舔。当他小心翼翼地咬下去时，阿斯卡的整个身体突然一颤，双腿间的那处也逐渐变得湿润。

Not about to let Shinji toy with her continuously like this, her hand found the button at his jeans, and she undid it with one hand. Pushing them down a little, his erection sprang up immediately, threatening to spring out of his boxers. When her hand wrapped around it, she heard Shinji give a low groan, and he suddenly stopped sucking on her breasts. Now that she had his attention, Asuka began stroking him slowly, working her hand up and down his shaft. She watched his expression, pleased that it was affecting him so. She was careful as she did this however, not wanting him to climax.  
不愿再让真嗣这样一直逗弄她，她的手找到了他牛仔裤上的纽扣，单手解开。稍稍往下推了推，他的勃起立刻弹了出来，眼看就要从内裤里蹦出。当她的手握住它时，她听到真嗣发出了一声低沉的呻吟，他突然停止了吮吸她的乳房。现在她吸引了他的注意，明日香开始慢慢抚弄他，上下移动着她的手。她观察着他的表情，很高兴这影响了他。然而，她做得很小心，不想让他达到高潮。

While she continued stroking him, the spot between her legs continued to throb and her underwear was thoroughly stained. She was nearing that moment, that sweet moment when they would be one. Asuka wasn't sure how much longer she could hold out, but if she continued doing this to Shinji, it wouldn't matter anyway.  
在她继续抚弄他的同时，她双腿间的那一点继续悸动，内裤也彻底湿透了。她快要达到那个时刻，那个甜蜜的合为一体的时刻。明日香不确定自己还能坚持多久，但如果她继续这样对真嗣，反正也无所谓了。

Stopping what she was doing, she glanced at his face. He was panting heavily, sweat permeating his brow; it looked like she had stopped just in time. Leaning up, she kissed him gently, and then pushed him onto his back. Shinji watched her as she sat there on his lap, looking down at the thing pressing against his boxers. He was starting to get a feeling they were jumping headfirst into unknown territory. Just the sight of Asuka, the candlelight flickering off her well developed body was enough to make him want such a thing.  
她停下手中的动作，瞥了一眼他的脸。他正喘着粗气，汗水浸湿了额头；看起来她及时停下了。她俯身轻轻吻了他，然后将他推倒仰躺。真嗣看着她坐在自己腿上，低头盯着那顶着他内裤的东西。他开始觉得他们正一头扎进未知的领域。仅仅是看到明日香，烛光在她发育良好的身体上闪烁，就足以让他渴望这样的事情。

Slowly, Asuka began pulling his jeans of him, and then removed her own pants, and tossed her bra to the side as well. Once again, they were in nothing but their underwear.  
慢慢地，明日香开始脱下他的牛仔裤，然后脱掉自己的裤子，顺手把胸罩也扔到一旁。又一次，他们只剩下了内衣。

They stared at each other for a moment, eyeing each others bodies. They had seen each other like this many times, but there was something different this time. Both of them had confessed their love for the other, so there was no longer anything holding them back. What were they waiting for?  
他们彼此凝视了一会儿，打量着对方的身体。他们这样相处过很多次，但这次有些不同。两人都已经向对方表白了爱意，所以不再有任何阻碍。他们还在等什么呢？

"...Asuka?" asked Shinji quietly.  
"...Asuka?" 真嗣轻声问道。

"Yes?" "是的？"

"...What do you want?" "...你想要什么？"

"...I want you to love me," whispered Asuka in a voice that was nearly inaudible.  
“……我想让你爱我，”明日香低声细语，几乎听不见。

Shinji stared back at her, taking her in. He knew what she wanted, but going about it still felt a bit strange. But, he would be lying if he said he didn't want to experience it either.  
真嗣凝视着她，将她的一切尽收眼底。他明白她的渴望，但这样做仍让他感到些许陌生。不过，如果说他对此毫无期待，那也是在撒谎。

Sitting up, he wrapped his arms around her, kissing her quickly, before gently lowering her onto the bed, towering over her. He began kissing her body, starting at her lips, and then slowly working his way down, passing over her breasts, naval, trailing down her thighs, before ending at her feet. He knew all of her sensitive spots, and made sure to press all of them when he moved down.  
他坐起身，双臂环抱住她，迅速地吻了她一下，然后温柔地将她放倒在床上，俯视着她。他开始亲吻她的身体，从唇瓣开始，然后缓缓向下，经过她的双乳、肚脐，沿着大腿一路向下，最后停留在她的脚尖。他熟知她所有的敏感点，每一步移动都确保触及那些地方。

There was one spot he neglected however, and as he made his may back up her body, he stopped here. Her underwear was soaked, which he had expected, but he could see the faint outline of the flesh behind the cotton. Glancing up at her face, he saw that Asuka's face was dyed red in embarrassment, apparently for how wet she was, but she didn't say anything on the subject.  
然而，有一个地方他忽略了，当他沿着她的身体向上移动时，他在这里停了下来。她的内裤湿透了，这是他预料之中的，但他能看见棉质布料后隐约的肉色。抬头看向她的脸，他发现明日香的脸因尴尬而染上了红色，显然是因为她有多湿，但她对此只字未提。

Slowly, Shinji placed his finger over her spot, watching Asuka's reaction. She bit down hard on her lips, her body starting to squirm. He began gently rubbing his index finger against her, feeling the soft flesh moving as he applied a small amount of pressure. He was teasing her now, enjoying the changes in her expression, but Asuka wasn't going to let things end like this.  
慢慢地，真嗣将手指放在她的敏感点上，观察着明日香的反应。她紧紧咬住嘴唇，身体开始扭动。他开始轻轻地用食指摩擦她，感受着柔软的肉体随着他施加的轻微压力而移动。他现在是在逗弄她，享受着她表情变化，但明日香不打算就这样结束。

Forcing herself towards him, she placed her lips against his, and then pushed him down, climbing on top of him. His thing was rubbing against her spot now, and Asuka had to hold herself back, fearing that she may climax at any second. Staring down at Shinji, she smiled slightly, and then placed her hand in his. She wanted this to happen, and wasn't about to take no for an answer, but she knew that Shinji wanted this as well.  
她强迫自己向他靠近，将嘴唇贴在他的唇上，然后将他推倒，爬到他身上。他的东西现在正摩擦着她的敏感点，明日香不得不克制自己，担心自己随时可能达到高潮。低头看着真嗣，她微微一笑，然后将手放在他的手上。她希望这件事发生，不打算接受任何拒绝，但她知道真嗣也想要这样。

"...Shinji?" "...真嗣？"

"...Yes?" “……嗯？”

"I...want to see everything."  
"我...想看遍一切。"

"I...I as well. I want to see your everything Asuka," muttered Shinji.  
"我...我也是。我想看到你的全部，明日香，" 真嗣喃喃道。

Asuka smiled at his nervousness. She felt nervous herself, but she was also prepared.  
明日香对他的紧张报以微笑。她自己也感到紧张，但她同样做好了准备。

Both of them turned away from each other, and slowly removed the last article of clothing they both had on. Sitting with his back to Asuka, Shinji let out a deep sigh, hardly believing this was happening. When he heard a soft voice behind him, he took this to mean it was okay to turn around. Shinji did so, and both of them stared at each others naked bodies.  
两人彼此转过身去，缓缓脱下身上最后一件衣物。背对着明日香坐下，真嗣深吸一口气，几乎不敢相信这一切正在发生。当他听到身后传来轻柔的声音时，他便理解为可以转身了。真嗣照做了，两人凝视着对方的裸体。

The candlelight dyed both their bodies a murky yellow, allowing them to take everything in. They stared at one another, their eyes passing over each other privates. Shinji couldn't speak, too enthralled by Asuka's beauty from her well formed breasts, to her shapely hips. But it was what he saw between her legs that his eyes largely focused on. Against all odds, he grew even harder, something Asuka didn't fail to notice with her own eyes locked on his manhood. She had climaxed with just his fingers, but if he put that inside her, what would happen?  
烛光将他们的身体染成朦胧的黄色，让他们得以细细打量。他们凝视着彼此，目光掠过对方的私密之处。真嗣无法言语，完全被明日香的美所吸引，从她那匀称的乳房到她那优美的臀部。但他的目光主要集中在她双腿之间的部位。尽管可能性微乎其微，他却变得更加坚挺，明日香没有错过这一变化，她的目光紧锁在他的男性象征上。她仅凭他的手指就已达到高潮，但如果他将那物放入她体内，会发生什么呢？

They continued staring at one another, unsure how they were supposed to progress from here. Should they embrace and kiss first, or just dive right in? While Asuka considered this, she couldn't help but chuckle slightly, catching Shinji off guard. He thought she was laughing at his size at first, but then she spoke.  
他们继续彼此凝视，不确定接下来该如何进展。应该先拥抱接吻，还是直接进入正题？当明日香思考这个问题时，她忍不住轻声笑了起来，这让真嗣有些措手不及。他起初以为她在嘲笑他的身材，但随后她开口了。

"It's odd. I've thought about this several times, but it's still strange to actually be here."  
“真奇怪。虽然我曾多次想象过这一刻，但实际身处其中还是感觉很陌生。”

"...I know what you mean," nodded Shinji slowly.  
“……我明白你的意思。”真嗣缓缓点头道。

"Hey Shinji..." "嘿，真嗣……"

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"I love you." "我爱你。"

"...I love you too, Asuka."  
"……我也爱你，明日香。"

Asuka smiled at him, and then inched closer. Shinji opened his arms, welcoming her, and then hugged her gently. They loved each other, and wanted to experience the depths of that love together. Looking up at him, Asuka kissed him slowly, and then drew back from him, crawling across the bed to her nightstand. Shinji was confused at what she was doing, but his eyes quickly locked onto her butt, so his mind kinda shut off for a second, and he didn't notice her open the drawer, pulling something out.  
明日香朝他微微一笑，然后慢慢靠近。真嗣张开双臂，欢迎她的到来，随后温柔地拥抱了她。他们深爱着彼此，渴望共同体验这份爱的深度。明日香抬头看着他，缓缓地吻了他，然后从他身边退开，爬到床边的床头柜前。真嗣对她的举动感到困惑，但他的目光很快被她的臀部吸引，一时间思绪有些停滞，没有注意到她打开了抽屉，取出了某样东西。

When she came back to him, it took her several seconds of shaking him until his mind turned back on, and he saw that she was holding something in her.  
当她回到他身边时，她花了好几秒钟摇晃他，直到他的意识重新上线，他才看到她手里拿着什么东西。

"Put this on...you should probably understand what it's for. The possibility exists for me...and I'd rather we not have an accident."  
“把这个穿上...你应该能明白它的用途。我有可能...我宁愿我们不要发生意外。”

Shinji hadn't even considered this, but now that Asuka said it, he was reminded of what they were truly doing. He was glad that she had the foresight to grab this, since he hadn't even thought about that possibility until this moment.  
真嗣之前从未考虑过这一点，但如今听明日香这么一说，他才意识到他们真正在做的事情。他很庆幸明日香有先见之明，拿了这个，因为他直到此刻才想到这种可能性。

When it was on, he stared back at Asuka inches away from him. She nodded once at him, and then slowly laid herself down on the bed. Shinji crawled over to her, placing his body parallel with hers. Glancing at her face, he didn't see any second thoughts appear there, only a certain determination. Letting out a sigh to relax himself, he grasped his manhood, and slowly entered her, parting her soft flesh.  
当一切准备就绪，他回望着近在咫尺的明日香。她朝他点了点头，然后缓缓躺在了床上。真嗣爬到她身边，让自己的身体与她平行。他瞥了一眼她的脸，没有看到任何犹豫，只有一种坚定的神情。他深吸一口气让自己放松，握住自己的下体，缓缓进入她，分开她柔软的肌肤。

Almost immediately, Asuka clawed at his back so forcefully that she drew blood, and her teeth sank into his shoulder, crying out. Shinji immediately thought that he had done something wrong, but then he heard a pained reply from Asuka.  
几乎立刻，明日香用力抓挠他的背部，以至于划出了血痕，她的牙齿咬进他的肩膀，发出呼喊。真嗣立刻以为自己做错了什么，但随后他听到了明日香痛苦的回应。

"No...it's not your fault. This is just the first time is, though I didn't expect it to be this painful."  
"不……这不是你的错。只是这是第一次，虽然我没想到会这么痛。"

"...Do you want me to stop?"  
"……你想让我停下来吗？"

"No, I want this. Just...go slow."  
"不，我想要这个。只是……慢一点。"

Shinji wasn't sure about this since he didn't want to cause Asuka any pain, but if she wanted this then he would oblige. Slowly, he began pushing himself in further, his body shivering with pleasure. Even with the rubber, the feeling of her flesh wrapping around him was indescribable. Shinji very nearly climaxed then, and probably would have if he hadn't built up some resistance to Asuka's advances, but it was a very close thing.  
真嗣对此并不确定，因为他不想给明日香带来任何痛苦，但如果她想要这样，他会顺从。慢慢地，他开始更深入地推进，身体因快感而颤抖。即便隔着橡胶，她的肉体包裹着他的感觉仍难以言表。真嗣几乎就要达到高潮了，如果不是他对明日香的挑逗有了些抵抗力，他可能已经达到了，但那确实非常接近。

Asuka continued clawing at his back, trying to hold back the pain that she was feeling. It had been far more painful than she had expected, but Shinji was gentle and listened to her. He wasn't moving right now, but letting her become accustomed to this feeling, and letting the pain subside. Asuka wondered how Shinji was feeling right now. It was painful for her, but Shinji must certainly be feeling okay.  
明日香继续抓挠着他的背，试图抑制她感受到的疼痛。这比她预期的要痛苦得多，但真嗣很温柔，也听从她的感受。他现在没有移动，而是让她适应这种感觉，让疼痛消退。明日香想知道真嗣现在感觉如何。对她来说很痛苦，但真嗣肯定感觉不错。

Slowly though, the pain began to fade away, and Asuka started to relax. Letting out a slight sigh, she kissed Shinji briefly, happy that he had waited for her. She hoped that it would no longer be painful, but even if it was, she wanted him to enjoy this at least.  
不过，慢慢地，疼痛开始消退，明日香也开始放松。她轻轻叹了口气，短暂地吻了真嗣，庆幸他等了她。她希望不再痛苦，但即使如此，她至少希望他能享受这一刻。

"I'm better now...so you can start moving."  
"我现在好些了...所以你可以开始动了。"

Shinji didn't say anything to her, but slowly started to move. What had initially been painful for Asuka, quickly turned into something different. Her entire body jerked as Shinji moved inside her, her walls contracting around his manhood. She didn't know what this feeling was, and couldn't describe it. The pleasure she had felt before couldn't even compare.  
真嗣没有对她说话，但慢慢地开始移动。起初对明日香来说很痛苦的事情，很快就变成了另一种感觉。随着真嗣在她体内的移动，她的整个身体都抽搐起来，她的内壁紧缩着他的阳刚。她不知道这种感觉是什么，也无法描述。之前感受到的快感根本无法与之相比。

Her voice began leaking out against her will, her face filled with ecstasy. She began moving her hips as well, grinding her body against Shinji's. There movements synced up, and their lips found each other hungrily, kissing wildly as they made love. Shinji began moving faster, and Asuka soon had her legs wrapped around his waist. Every time he penetrated her, her body surged with electricity, threatening to force her to climax.  
她的声音开始不由自主地泄露出来，脸上充满了极乐。她也开始移动臀部，将身体压向真嗣。他们的动作同步了，嘴唇急切地找到了对方，疯狂地亲吻着，在爱中交融。真嗣开始加快动作，明日香很快将双腿缠绕在他的腰间。每次他深入她，她的身体都像触电一样，几乎要迫使她达到高潮。

She didn't know how much longer she could take this pleasure, but she still wanted it to last a while. Pressing her hands against his chest, she pushed Shinji onto his back, forcing him outside of her. She was feeling much better now, and wanted to try something. Climbing on top of him, she rested her hips against his, grinning down seductively at him. Shinji recognized that grin, and though he didn't know why, he felt a bit fearful.  
她不知道自己还能承受这份欢愉多久，但她仍希望它能持续一会儿。她双手抵在他的胸前，将真嗣推倒，迫使他离开自己。现在她感觉好多了，想尝试些新花样。她爬到他身上，将臀部压在他身上，低头妩媚地对他笑着。真嗣认出了那个笑容，尽管他不知道为什么，但他感到一丝恐惧。

Slowly, Asuka raised herself above him, and then for the first time, grabbed his thing with her barehand, and slowly lowered herself onto it. The feel of it entering her was different this time without the pain, and Asuka let out a shrill shriek as her whole body tensed up, squeezing Shinji's manhood. He very nearly climaxed then, but he managed to control himself, gripped Asuka's hips, and started thrusting inside of her. Her moans grew louder, and she placed her hand in his, squeezing it tightly.  
慢慢地，明日香撑起身体，然后第一次用裸手握住了他的那物，缓缓坐了下去。这次没有疼痛，感觉不同了，明日香发出一声尖叫，全身紧绷，紧握着真嗣的阳具。他差点就高潮了，但他控制住了自己，抓住明日香的臀部，开始在她体内抽动。她的呻吟声越来越大，她把手放在他的手上，紧紧握住。

She started moving her hips as well, not letting Shinji do all the work, and he moved one of his hands to her breast, cupping it gently. Asuka's face scrunched up at this, and her hips suddenly grew weak, forcing her to fall onto into Shinji's chest. Grasping her hips again, Shinji continued thrusting as they began kissing. Every time her body moved, he could feel her squeezing him. There wasn't any feeling better than this thought Shinji.  
她也跟着扭动起臀部，不让真嗣一个人承担所有，同时他的一只手移到了她的乳房上，轻轻地捧着。这让明日香的脸皱了起来，她的臀部突然无力，迫使她倒向真嗣的胸膛。真嗣再次抓住她的臀部，继续挺动，两人开始亲吻。每次她的身体一动，他都能感觉到她在紧缩。没有什么比这更美妙的了，真嗣心想。

He was at his limit though, and knew he couldn't go on for any longer. He tried telling this to Asuka, but she was focused on his lips right now. Moving faster now, he felt Asuka start shuddering uncontrollably, and knew that she was must be near her moment as well. Thrusting roughly, he felt his own body shudder, and within moments, Asuka let out another shrill scream, reaching her climax, just as Shinji felt himself reach his own.  
然而，他已经到了极限，知道自己不能再继续下去了。他试图告诉明日香这一点，但她现在正专注于他的嘴唇。他加快了速度，感觉到明日香开始无法控制地颤抖，知道她也快要达到高潮了。他粗暴地挺动，感觉到自己的身体也在颤抖，片刻之后，明日香再次发出尖锐的尖叫，达到了高潮，就在这时，真嗣也感受到了自己的巅峰。

**(Ends here. Pretty much everything that happened prior to this was included, with the obvious change in that they actually have sex.)  
（到此结束。几乎所有之前发生的事情都包括在内，显然的变化是他们真的发生了性关系。）**

They collapsed upon each other, not moving, Shinji still inside Asuka. He honestly didn't think he could move anytime soon, and felt incredibly tired. For all Shinji's stamina, there seemed to be something separate that was required when making love. Well, it was there first time afterall.  
他们彼此相拥着倒下，一动不动，真嗣仍在明日香体内。他真的觉得自己短时间内无法动弹，感到异常疲惫。尽管真嗣体力充沛，但在做爱时似乎还需要某种额外的力量。毕竟，这是他们的第一次。

Panting rather heavily, Shinji glanced at Asuka who was still laying on him, her face pressed against his chest. Her back was glistening with sweat in the candlelight, and her hair was ragged and messy. Shinji could only assume how bad the bedroom probably smelled right now, and the sheets might need a change as well. As much as he enjoyed this though, he realized that they couldn't continue laying like this, especially since he was still inside her.  
真嗣喘着粗气，瞥了一眼仍躺在他身上的明日香，她的脸紧贴着他的胸膛。在烛光下，她的背部闪烁着汗水的光泽，头发凌乱不堪。真嗣只能想象此刻卧室的气味有多糟糕，床单或许也需要更换了。尽管他很享受这一切，但他意识到他们不能继续这样躺着，尤其是他还留在她体内。

"Asuka...how do you feel?" he asked.  
“明日香……你感觉如何？”他问道。

"Exhausted. Tired. Hungry. Gross, like I need a bath. But," she mumbled as she looked up at him, "more than anything, I'm happy."  
筋疲力尽。疲惫不堪。饥肠辘辘。感觉自己脏兮兮的，急需洗个澡。但是，" 她喃喃自语，抬头望着他，"最重要的是，我感到无比幸福。

Sitting up, Asuka crawled off him, and let out a low sigh, glancing down at herself. She really needed to clean herself off properly now that she looked at the state of her lower region. Swinging her legs off the bed, she got unsteadily to her feet, and then winced in pain. Now that the pleasure was over with, it looked like the pain was coming back. It had been her first time afterall, so this was somewhat expected, but she would likely be sore in the morning.  
坐起身来，明日香从他身上爬下来，发出一声低沉的叹息，低头看了看自己。现在她确实需要好好清洁一下，看看自己下半身的状况就知道了。她把腿从床上挪开，摇摇晃晃地站了起来，然后痛得皱起了眉头。现在快感过去了，看来疼痛又要回来了。毕竟这是她的第一次，所以这种情况在某种程度上是可以预料的，但明天她可能会感到酸痛。

While Asuka disappeared into the bathroom, Shinji went through the purpose of discarding the used rubber. Most people probably just flushed them down the toilet, but he didn't have the luxury of that. Well, he decided to dump it in a wastepaper basket for now, and would deal with it properly later.  
在明日香走进浴室的时候，真嗣开始处理用过的避孕套。大多数人可能直接把它冲进马桶，但他没有这个条件。嗯，他决定暂时把它扔进废纸篓，稍后再妥善处理。

Afterwards, he cleaned himself off properly as well, though Asuka seemed to be taking it a step forward. Using the water they used to wash their dishes, Asuka dumped an entire gallon jug over her nude body while standing in the shower, cleaning herself using both soap and shampoo. Shinji would have done the same, but it had been the last filled jug in the house, and Shinji couldn't really blame Asuka for wanting to cleanse herself. Now that they were out of the moment, the whole bedroom smelled, and they had all three of the windows open.  
之后，他也认真地清洗了自己，尽管明日香似乎更进一步。她用洗碗的水，站在淋浴间里，将整整一桶水倒在自己赤裸的身体上，同时使用肥皂和洗发水清洁。真嗣本也想这么做，但那是家里最后一桶装满的水，他无法责怪明日香想要彻底清洁自己的愿望。现在他们脱离了那个时刻，整个卧室弥漫着异味，他们打开了所有的三扇窗户。

Throwing on a new clothes, Shinji took one of the candles downstairs with him, and brought up Asuka's half eaten dinner. She had said she was hungry afterall.  
换上新衣服，真嗣拿着一支蜡烛下楼，顺便带上了明日香吃了一半的晚餐。毕竟她说过她饿了。

When he returned to the bedroom, she was newly dressed in fresh clothes and sitting on the bed.  
当他回到卧室时，她已经换上了干净的衣服，坐在床上。

"I was wondering where you went, though I must say I'm glad you remembered what I said."  
"我还在想你去哪儿了，不过我得说，很高兴你还记得我说的。"

Even though the food was cold, Asuka dug in heartily, and Shinji sat beside her, thinking back to the moment between them. It was one of those memories that he was likely to remember for the rest of his life.  
尽管食物已经凉了，明日香还是津津有味地吃了起来，而真嗣坐在她旁边，回想着他们之间的那一刻。这是他很可能一生都会记得的记忆之一。

"Thinking about something?" asked Asuka, glancing over at him between mouthfuls.  
"在想什么呢？" 明日香一边吃着，一边瞥了他一眼问道。

"Hmm...yeah..." "嗯...是啊..."

"I guess I don't really need to ask what."  
"我想我不用问是什么了。"

Finishing her plate, she set it on the nightstand beside her bed, and then slid into her spot. Beckoning Shinji towards her, he slowly moved across the bed, and crawled under the covers beside her. Quickly, Asuka faced him, wrapping her arms around him, snuggling up to him. She had never felt more happy.  
她吃完盘中的食物，将其放在床头柜上，然后滑进自己的位置。她招手让真嗣过来，他缓缓地移动到床边，爬进被窝里，躺在她身旁。很快，明日香转向他，双臂环绕着他，紧贴着他。她从未感到如此幸福。

Pressing her lips against his, she said, "Thank you Shinji, for making me feel this way. I love you."  
她将双唇紧贴在他的唇上，说道：“谢谢你，真嗣，让我有这种感觉。我爱你。”

Shinji kissed her back, holding her strongly against him.  
真嗣回吻了她，紧紧地将她拥入怀中。

"I love you as well," mumbled Shinji, returning the kiss.  
“我也爱你。”真嗣喃喃道，回吻了她。

Slowly, they fell asleep in each others arms, there love for each other making them whole, where once there had been two hearts beating together, there now was one.  
慢慢地，他们在彼此的怀抱中入睡，对彼此的爱让他们完整，曾经两颗心一起跳动的地方，现在合而为一。

High above the clouds circling over Kyoto; above the island of Japan; above the entire Asian continent, and far beyond the Earths atmosphere, Lilith had watched and waited for two years. Time did not matter to her, and compared to the life she had lived before with Adam, the time watching Shinji and Asuka grow and love each other wasn't even a fraction of that time. Still, it had brought back memories that she had long thought gone.  
在环绕京都的云层之上；在日本岛之上；在整个亚洲大陆之上，远超地球大气层，莉莉丝已经观察和等待了两年。时间对她来说无关紧要，与和亚当一起度过的漫长岁月相比，看着真嗣和明日香成长并相爱的时间甚至不及其一小部分。然而，这唤起了她久已遗忘的记忆。

Just as she had promised those two years ago before she had taken their memories, she would allow them to grow whole and love each other again, which had now come to pass. By all means, this should still be enough.  
正如她两年前在他们失去记忆之前所承诺的那样，她会让他们再次成长并相爱，如今这一切已经实现。按理说，这应该已经足够了。

But Lilith hadn't been idle this entire time. The past may affect them though they not know it, but the future is what really mattered now. She couldn't restrain humanity indefinitely, and most of her power was already locked away, containing the souls of the Lilim inside the Black Egg.  
但莉莉丝这段时间并未闲着。过去虽影响深远，他们却未必知晓，然而现在真正重要的是未来。她无法永远束缚人类，且大部分力量已被封存，将莉莉姆的灵魂囚禁于黑卵之中。

Her and Rei had continued talking with each other about what would happen afterwards. Rei, who had known and watched Shinji and Asuka, was a suitable conversation partner about these subjects. They had briefly discussed it before Shinji and Asuka had left, but they had gone in further detail about it later, discussing the finer points and details. There was only so much that Lilith could do, even if she tried occasionally pushing Shinji in the right direction. Ultimately, he would shape his, and Asuka's futures together.  
她和丽继续讨论着事后可能发生的情况。丽，这位熟知并观察过真嗣和明日香的人，是这些话题的合适交谈对象。在真嗣和明日香离开前，他们曾简短地谈及此事，但后来又深入探讨了更多细节。尽管莉莉丝偶尔试图引导真嗣走向正轨，但最终，他和明日香的未来将由他们共同塑造。

What could happen, and what couldn't happen however; this was what Lilith had decided. She had given them two years already, and they had come to love each other in this time, but time wasn't on there side. Eventually, they would learn this, but until then, they would still have several years until that moment. Lilith herself could possibly change the future by returning the Lilim to their garden, but Shinji wouldn't be prepared by the time they found him.  
莉莉丝已经决定了可能发生与不可能发生的事。她已经给了他们两年的时间，在这段时间里，他们彼此相爱，但时间并不站在他们这一边。最终，他们会明白这一点，但在那之前，他们还有几年的时间。莉莉丝自己或许可以通过将莉莉姆送回花园来改变未来，但当他们找到真嗣时，他还没有准备好。

"It all depends on what they do, and whether Shinji can grow even further. More time is what they require, though it will eventually seem like a fleeting memory to them."  
“这一切都取决于他们的行动，以及真嗣是否能进一步成长。他们需要更多的时间，尽管最终这时间对他们来说会像转瞬即逝的记忆。”

From where she existed, Lilith peered down through the clouds of Kyoto and into the house where Shinji and Asuka were currently laying beside each other.  
从她所在的地方，莉莉丝透过京都的云层，俯视着真嗣和明日香正并肩躺在一起的那所房子。

"I wish you two all the best," Lilith whispered as she turning her eyes away from them, refocusing her attention on the Black Egg that held the souls of all four billion humans.  
"我祝你们俩一切顺利，"莉莉丝低声说道，目光从他们身上移开，重新聚焦在那颗黑蛋上，里面囚禁着所有四十亿人类的灵魂。

**It's been a long while coming, but we have finally reached this point. There is a lot I could say, and maybe some that I should say with regards to the second half, but I'd rather it be a surprise, and I'm sure some people can figure it out anyway. I will say though that the next chapter I've had in my mind since before Spawn of Adam finished, so I honestly can't wait to start working on it. I will however be taking a bit of a break, so it's highly unlikely that there'll be another chapter before March, so until then, I leave you with this Valentines Day chapter.  
虽然已经等待了很久，但我们终于到达了这一刻。有很多话可以说，也许关于后半部分有些话我应该说，但我更希望它是个惊喜，而且我相信有些人无论如何都能猜到。不过，我得说，下一章的内容从《亚当之子》结束前就在我脑海中了，所以我真的迫不及待想要开始创作。不过，我会休息一段时间，所以很可能在三月之前不会有新章节，在此之前，我留给你们这个情人节章节。**

### Chapter 30: Rebirth

**Here we go! Sit down, strap in, and prepare for a long chapter!  
开始了！坐稳，系好安全带，准备迎接长篇大章！**

She woke up. Had she been dreaming? She felt like she had been, and that it had been wonderful, but she couldn't recall what it had been about. Then, was she still dreaming now? If so, then this was incredibly real. The sand squishing between her toes and hands as she lay there, the salty smell of the ocean breeze tickling her nose. Was this truly a dream?  
她醒了。她是否做了梦？她感觉自己做了梦，而且是个美梦，但她记不清梦的内容了。那么，她现在还在梦中吗？如果是的话，那这梦也太真实了。沙子在她脚趾和手掌间挤压的感觉，海风中咸咸的气息轻拂着她的鼻子。这真的是梦吗？

She sat up, albeit slowly. Her whole body ached as if she hadn't used it for months. Trying to stand proved impossible, and she fell back onto her butt. Her body felt weak, and her vision was hazy. Her throat was dry, and her stomach began to rumble. What had happened to put her in this situation? Where was she in the first place?  
她缓缓坐起身，尽管动作迟缓。全身酸痛，仿佛数月未曾活动。试图站立却力不从心，她再次跌坐在地。身体虚弱，视线模糊。喉咙干涩，胃也开始咕咕作响。究竟发生了什么让她陷入这般境地？她又身在何处？

She turned around, digging her hands in the sand to move her body. It was still difficult for her to see, but she recognized the large buildings towering in the skyline. It was a city that she recognized easily, even with the apparent destruction.  
她转过身，双手在沙中摸索以移动身体。视线依旧模糊，但她认出了天际线上高耸的建筑物。即便满目疮痍，这座城市她依然一眼就能辨认出来。

This wasn't all though. Through her hazy vision, she saw a figure coming towards her. No, running would be a better explanation. She recognized them, this man. She tried opening her voice, but it hurt too much to speak right now. He seemed to understand something she didn't however, because he eased her worries.  
然而，不止如此。透过朦胧的视线，她看到一个人影正朝她走来。不，更确切地说是奔跑。她认出了他，这个男人。她试图开口，但喉咙的疼痛让她难以发声。不过，他似乎理解了她的某些未言之语，从而缓解了她的忧虑。

"It's alright. I've got you. Everything is going to be okay."  
"没事的，我在这儿。一切都会好起来的。"

He picked her up then, holding her against his body. She was incredibly light, so this proved easy. She wanted to say something, anything to this man that she thought she recognized, but he shushed her again.  
他随即抱起了她，将她紧贴在自己身上。她轻得惊人，这让他轻松不少。她本想对这个她觉得似曾相识的男人说些什么，但他再次轻声安抚她。

Wordlessly, he carried her across the beach, and up the concrete steps to the world above. People, at least a hundred of them, were walking around on the road just above the beach. Hundreds of tents of varying sizes and colors were pitched along the road, some of them directly against the remains of destroyed buildings. Some glanced in there direction, but most of them seemed too busy to give them a second thought.  
他默默地抱着她穿过沙滩，走上通往上方世界的混凝土台阶。路上至少有上百人在走动。数百顶大小和颜色各异的帐篷沿着道路搭设，有些直接紧挨着被毁建筑的废墟。有些人瞥了他们一眼，但大多数人似乎都忙得无暇顾及。

The man continued walking past all these tents. He seemed to know his way around the area well, and had a destination in mind. While still in his arms, she craned her neck around, looking at all the people going about their business. Nearly all of them were carrying something in their arms, or had backpacks slung over their shoulders. It was like a tightly knit colony it seemed.  
那男人继续走过这些帐篷。他似乎对这片区域很熟悉，心中有着明确的目的地。尽管她仍在他怀里，她还是扭过头，观察着周围忙碌的人们。几乎所有人手里都拿着东西，或者肩上挎着背包。这里就像一个紧密相连的殖民地。

"We're here," said the man suddenly, and she looked forward just as he ducked his head, stepping inside of a large tent. The canvas was green, and the sunlight which shined through created a murky green glow on the inside. There were several makeshift beds on the inside, and the man laid her down on one of them.  
“我们到了，”男人突然说道，她向前看去，只见他低头钻进了一个大帐篷。帐篷的帆布是绿色的，阳光透过布料，在里面投下一片朦胧的绿光。里面有几张简易床铺，男人将她放在其中一张上。

He glanced around the large tent, capable of allowing multiple people to stand upright inside of it, but one cursory glance around showed that there wasn't anybody else inside.  
他环顾这个宽敞的帐篷，足以让多人直立其中，但匆匆一瞥便知里面空无一人。

"Stay here, and don't move. I'm going to find someone to check on you."  
“待在这里，别动。我去找人来给你检查一下。”

She tried to say something again, but he was already leaving the tent. Without any other options, she closed her eyes and rested her weak body on the bed. She trusted this man that she thought she knew, but the whole situation baffled her. She recognized this city, the man, and even some of the people she had seen walking around, but everything else was confusing. What had happened?  
她试图再次说些什么，但他已经离开了帐篷。别无选择之下，她闭上眼睛，将虚弱的身体靠在床上休息。她相信这个自以为认识的男人，但整个情况让她感到困惑。她认得这座城市、这个男人，甚至一些她见过的行人，但其他一切都令人费解。到底发生了什么？

Several minutes went by with her laying there, her eyes closed. Try as she might, she couldn't remember what had happened, even though she knew it was important. Before she could think of anything else though, she heard hurried footsteps, and the sound of a woman's voice.  
她躺在那里，闭着眼睛，几分钟过去了。尽管她知道这很重要，但无论怎么努力，她都想不起发生了什么。然而，还没等她想出别的，她就听到了急促的脚步声和女人的声音。

"How was she?" "她怎么样？"

"Weak, couldn't speak, bit disoriented; same as everyone that has returned, though she recognized me."  
"很虚弱，说不出话，有些迷糊；和所有回来的人一样，不过她认出我了。"

"That's something at least. Well, let's see her."  
"至少还有这点。好吧，我们去看看她。"

The tent flap opened, momentarily piercing her eyes with the change in light. As her eyes adjusted, she could make out the two distinct figures. One was the man who had carried her here, and the other was a woman. The woman, she recognized her from the short length blonde hair, though she hadn't seen her were jeans or a t-shirt in a long time.  
帐篷的门帘被掀开，突如其来的光线瞬间刺痛了她的眼睛。待视线适应后，她辨认出两个身影。一个是将她带到这里来的男人，另一个则是位女子。她从女子那头短短的金发认出了她，尽管她已经很久没见过她穿牛仔裤或 T 恤的样子了。

The woman pulled up a chair to sit beside her and started examining her body. She checked her eyes, her arms, legs, heart rate, and reflexes. This was all rather sudden, but she let this woman continued the examination. She knew and trusted her, even though she couldn't place the name.  
女子拉过一把椅子坐在她旁边，开始检查她的身体。她检查了她的眼睛、手臂、腿、心率和反射。这一切来得相当突然，但她任由这位女子继续检查。她知道并信任她，尽管一时想不起她的名字。

Apparently done with the examination, the woman turned to the man and said, "I'm gonna have you leave for a minute. I want to talk to her alone for a minute."  
检查完毕后，女子转向男子说道：“我要你离开一会儿。我想单独和她谈谈。”

The man waved at her, understanding, and pulled something out from his breast pocket as he left the tent. This conjured up a strange memory for the woman lying on the bed, but she didn't know why. Reaching for the tent flap with her arm outstretched, she suddenly didn't want the man to leave, but the woman doing the examination placed something in her hand instead.  
那男人向她挥手示意，心领神会地从胸前口袋里掏出某物，离开帐篷。这勾起了躺在床上的女人一段奇异的记忆，但她不明白为何如此。她伸出手去抓帐篷的帘子，突然间不想让那男人离开，但进行检查的女人却将某物塞进了她的手中。

"Here drink this, but slowly."  
“来，喝这个，但要慢慢喝。”

She passed her a plastic cup filled with water, and she drank it slowly, sitting up slightly. Her throat didn't feel as painful anymore, and her body began to feel invigorated.  
她递给她一个装满水的塑料杯，她慢慢坐起身来，小口啜饮。喉咙不再那么痛了，身体也开始感到精力充沛。

"Now," said the woman as she took the plastic cup away from her, "how do you feel, Misato?"  
"现在，" 女人从她手中拿走塑料杯，问道，"你感觉怎么样，美里？"

Katsuragi Misato opened her eyes wide, a rush of things returning to her mind, things that she had forgotten, which she shouldn't have. That's right, she was a major, part of the organization know as Nerv whose purpose was to prevent the annihilation of humankind from the beings known as Angels. And this woman in front of her was-  
葛城美里睁大了眼睛，一股记忆涌回脑海，那些她本不该忘记的事情。没错，她是一名少校，隶属于名为 NERV 的组织，其目的是防止人类被称作使徒的生物所灭绝。而眼前这位女性是——

"Ritsuko...wha-" "律子...什-"

"I'm sure you have plenty of questions, and I have my own. But before any of that, how do you feel?"  
"我确信你有很多问题，我也有我的。但在那之前，你感觉如何？"

Misato blinked, trying to formulate her thoughts. How did she feel?  
美里眨了眨眼，试图整理思绪。她感觉如何呢？

"I don't know. My whole body is sore, and just moving my muscles hurts."  
"我不知道。我全身酸痛，连动一下肌肉都疼。"

"That's typical from what we've seen so far."  
"到目前为止，这是我们常见的典型情况。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Never mind, I'll get back to that another time. How are your memories? What do you remember?"  
"没关系，我改天再处理。你的记忆怎么样？你记得些什么？"

"..My name, yours, Nerv, the Angels, and...the Evangelions."  
"...我的名字，你的，NERV，使徒，还有...EVA。"

"What about the man who carried you here?"  
"那个把你抱到这里来的男人呢？"

That's right, that man who carried her. She also knew who he was, because he was somebody important to her.  
没错，就是那个抱她的男人。她也知道他是谁，因为他对她来说是个重要的人。

"Kaji," Misato said. "加持," 美里说道。

"Good," replied Ritsuko. "Now, do you remember anything else? Something which happened before you woke up on the beach?"  
"好，" 律子回答道，"那么，你还记得其他什么吗？在你醒来之前，海滩上发生的事情？"

"I...know I don't think so-"  
"我...我觉得不记得了-"

Misato paused. No, she did remember something; it was coming back to her. The attack, the battle, the sound of gunfire and the smell of smoke. Blood though is what came to the front of her mind. The rich acrid smell of blood. But it wasn't just anybody's blood, it was her blood, slowing dripping out of her body, and there had been somebody else there with her. Who was it? The face, a male, slowly came back to her, and she remembered that it was Kaji.  
美里停顿了一下。不，她确实记得一些事情；记忆正逐渐回流。攻击，战斗，枪声和烟雾的味道。但首先浮现的是血的气味。那浓烈刺鼻的血腥味。但这不仅仅是任何人的血，这是她的血，缓缓从身体中滴落，而且当时还有另一个人在场。是谁？那张脸，一个男性，慢慢浮现在她脑海中，她记起来了，那是加持。

"I...died?" mumbled Misato. "Kaji and I died? How is that-"  
"我...死了？" 美里喃喃道。"我和加持都死了？这怎么可能——"

"Focus Misato," said Ritsuko abruptly. "What else do you remember? Slowly, what else do you remember?"  
"集中注意力，美里，" 律子突然说道。"你还记得什么？慢慢地，你还记得什么？"

"I...the hallway where we were, fighting back other soldiers. Other Nerv personal were there, assisting us, but we couldn't hold them off. It was only a matter of time until they broke through but-"  
"我...我们在那条走廊里，与其他士兵对抗。其他 NERV 人员也在那里，协助我们，但我们无法抵挡他们。他们突破只是时间问题，但是——"

"What else? Why were you there in the hallway. Why did you stay there?"  
"还有什么？你为什么会在走廊里。为什么你留在那里？"

"...an elevator, there was an elevator that we were guarding. We couldn't let them go down to the lower levels, but-"  
"...一个电梯，我们守着的一个电梯。我们不能让他们下到较低的楼层，但是-"

Something sprang to her mind. They had been fighting, holding them off as best as they could, but the superior numbers and weapons were thinning there numbers. Then, the elevator door opened, and somebody stepped out. The face, who was it? It was a target for the soldiers, somebody that they were aiming for, that they had orders to kill on sight. But the person, no, it was a girl now that Misato remembered, wanting something, she wanted to help.  
一些事情突然闪过她的脑海。他们一直在战斗，尽其所能地阻挡敌人，但优势的数量和武器正在削弱他们的力量。然后，电梯门打开了，有人走了出来。那张脸，是谁？那是士兵们的目标，他们接到的命令是见到就杀。但那个人，不，现在美里记得，那是个女孩，她想要什么，她想要帮忙。

Against her better judgement, Misato had listened to the girls request, and led her to an emergency duct. Both her and Kaji let the other Nerv personal hold them back while they did this, but they knew they didn't have much time. What was it though about the girl? Misato knew her, had known her for years before everything at Nerv had happened. The blue eyes, the vivid red hair, the fiery attitude that no one could contain. And then it clicked.  
尽管心存疑虑，美里还是听从了女孩的请求，带她来到了一个紧急通风管道。她和加持让其他 NERV 人员拦住他们，但他们知道时间不多了。这个女孩身上有什么特别之处呢？美里认识她，早在 NERV 发生一切之前就认识她多年了。那双蓝色的眼睛，鲜红的头发，以及无人能压制的火爆脾气。然后，她恍然大悟。

"Asuka," said Misato loudly. "Asuka was there. We were there at the elevator because Asuka was there...and...Rei. The soldiers wanted to get to the Evangelion pilots, but we were there to stop them. But Asuka wanted to go out a fight, even though Unit-02 was badly damaged, and came up to the floor we were on."  
“明日香，”美里大声说道，“明日香在那里。我们去电梯是因为明日香在那里……还有……丽。士兵们想接近 EVA 驾驶员，但我们去那里是为了阻止他们。但明日香想要出去战斗，尽管二号机受损严重，她还是来到了我们所在的楼层。”

"What else?" asked Ritsuko leaning forward.  
“还有什么？”律子向前倾身问道。

"Kaji and I led her to an access tunnel that would allow her to get there, but we both knew we couldn't follow her, so we stayed there to hold them off."  
加治和我带她到了一个通道口，她可以借此到达那里，但我们俩都知道我们不能跟着她，所以我们留在那里牵制他们。

"Why was Asuka so set on helping then, even though she knew Unit-02 was badly damaged?"  
为什么明日香那么坚决要帮忙，尽管她知道二号机受损严重？

Oddly, the answer came quickly to Misato. When one thought of Asuka, they would immediately begin thinking about the person associated with her, the boy who had given up on his own humanity to protect her. Misato had known both of them deeply, had watched them grow together in her own apartment. She cared about both of there well beings, but he in particular cared about her to the point that he would willingly sacrifice himself to protect her.  
奇怪的是，答案很快就在美里心中浮现。当人们想到明日香时，会立刻联想到与她相关的那个人，那个为了保护她而放弃自己人性的男孩。美里深知他们俩，曾在自己的公寓里看着他们一起成长。她关心他们两人的福祉，但他尤其关心她，甚至愿意牺牲自己来保护她。

"Shinji," mumbled Misato almost sadly. "She was going out to help Shinji fight the Mass-Produced Evangelions, even though hers was damaged, and I let her. What sort of a guardian am I?"  
"真嗣," 美里几乎悲伤地喃喃道。"她明知自己的 EVA 受损，还是出去帮助真嗣对抗量产型 EVA，而我却允许了她。我算是什么样的监护人呢？"

"You remember them then?"  
"那你还记得他们吗？"

"I do. They lived in my apartment for months, eating together, going to school together, fighting together. How could I forget that?"  
"我当然记得。他们在我的公寓里住了几个月，一起吃饭，一起上学，一起战斗。我怎么可能忘记这些呢？"

Ritsuko stared at Misato for several seconds before finally standing up.  
律子盯着美里看了好几秒，最后终于站了起来。

"Well, if you can remember all that, then it seems your mind is functioning properly. I don't want to tax you any further though, so I'm gonna give you some sleeping pills to help you rest."  
“好吧，如果你能记得所有这些，那么看来你的大脑功能正常。不过我不想让你再费神，所以我会给你一些安眠药帮助你休息。”

"I don't want, or need rest. I'm fine," said Misato as she tried to get up.  
“我不需要，也不想休息。我很好，”美里说着试图起身。

"You do, just like everyone else. I've already asked you enough, so it's time you got some sleep. Even if you're coherent, your body still needs to recover."  
"你也是，和其他人一样。我已经问过你很多了，现在是你该休息的时候了。即使你意识清醒，你的身体仍然需要恢复。"

"Wait Ritsuko. Answer me this at least. Are they okay, Shinji and Asuka...and is this what I think it is?"  
"等等，律子。至少回答我这个问题。他们还好吗，真嗣和明日香...这是我想的那样吗？"

Ritsuko eyed her for a second before letting out a sigh.  
律子看了她一眼，然后叹了口气。

"As to the first question, both Shinji and Asuka are not here, and nor is Rei; all the pilots are missing. And the second question...it is as it seems, the results of Third Impact, or After Impact."  
"至于第一个问题，真嗣和明日香都不在这里，丽也不在；所有驾驶员都失踪了。而第二个问题……正如表面所示，这是第三次冲击的结果，或者说冲击后的世界。"

"If this is After Impact then, why are we here?"  
"如果这是冲击后的世界，那我们为什么会在这里？"

Ritsuko shook her head and said, "I don't know, but that may be a question that only Shinji can answer."  
律子摇了摇头说：“我不知道，但那可能是只有真嗣才能回答的问题。”

Handing her another plastic cup filled with water and a small pill this time, Misato took the pill wordlessly and downed the entire cup of water, falling into a dreamless sleep.  
这次递给她另一杯装满水的塑料杯和一颗小药丸，Misato 默默地吞下药丸，一口气喝完整杯水，随即陷入无梦的沉睡。

---

Misato woke early the next morning after sleeping the entirety of the previous day away. When she opened her eyes, she could smell the familiar musky odor of tobacco filling her nostrils.  
Misato 在第二天清晨早早醒来，前一天她几乎睡了一整天。当她睁开眼睛时，她能闻到熟悉的烟草味充斥着她的鼻腔。

Opening her eyes, she saw Kaji sitting beside her in a chair, focusing on what appeared to be a large map detailing all of Tokyo-3.  
睁开眼睛，她看到 Kaji 坐在她旁边的椅子上，专注地看着一张似乎是详细描绘整个东京-3 的大地图。

"I would have thought that you would have given up that habit considering the situation," said Misato glancing at him.  
"我本以为考虑到当前的情况，你会戒掉那个习惯。" 美里瞥了他一眼说道。

"It's because we're in this situation that I needed one," replied Kaji. Looking away from the map, he asked her, "Feeling better today?"  
"正因为身处这种境地，我才更需要它。" 加持回答道。他移开地图，问她，"今天感觉好些了吗？"

"Yeah. Ritsuko was right, sleep was the best thing."  
"嗯，理津子说得对，睡眠是最好的良药。"

"She's normally right about those kind of things. Hungry?"  
"她通常对这类事情很准。饿了吗？"

"Starved." "饿坏了。"

Picking something off the ground, Kaji passed her a bag of chips and a bottle of water. Misato seemed rather crestfallen at the small bag of chips.  
从地上捡起东西，加持递给她一袋薯片和一瓶水。美里对这小袋薯片显得有些失望。

"It's better to start off eating slowly, though we don't have much in the way of supplies in the first place, so this is all you can eat for the moment."  
"虽然我们本来物资就不多，但最好还是慢慢开始吃，所以现在你只能吃这些了。"

"Have you guys been scavenging the surrounding area?"  
"你们有没有在周围地区搜寻过物资？"

"Yeah, people have been doing it in shifts."  
"是的，大家轮流去搜寻。"

"How many people are here right now?"  
"现在这里有多少人？"

"About one hundred and twenty, though this is only the count as of the morning. More keep returning everyday."  
"大约一百二十人，不过这只是今早的统计。每天都有更多人回来。"

Misato had about a hundred different questions that she wanted to ask them, but she swallowed for the moment, slowly eating and drinking.  
美里有一百多个问题想问他们，但她暂时咽了下去，慢慢地吃喝着。

A short time later, Ritsuko ducked through the tent flap, entering the tent. She had large bags under eyes, and looked like she hadn't slept in days.  
不久之后，律子低头钻进帐篷的帘子，进入了帐篷。她的眼底下有大大的黑眼圈，看起来已经好几天没睡了。

"Something wrong?" asked Kaji.  
“出什么事了吗？”加持问道。

"Patrols found ten more people about half an hour ago, and I've been running from one tent to the other checking them. I'm exhausted."  
“巡逻队在半小时前又发现了十个人，我一直在各个帐篷之间奔波检查他们。我累坏了。”

Sitting down on the bed opposite Misato, she took a large gulp of water and looked across to where Misato was laying.  
坐在对面美里床边的她，大口喝了一口水，然后望向美里躺着的地方。

"You seem better today at least. No disorientation, dizziness, nausea?"  
“你今天看起来好多了，至少没有迷失方向、头晕或恶心吧？”

"No, I feel better." “没有，我感觉好多了。”

"Good, though I can't say I'm surprised."  
"不错，虽然我并不惊讶。"

"...Ritsuko?" "...律子？"

"Everybody that has been returning has had the same symptoms. Disorientation, can't speak, and there bodies have atrophied; it's all similar to waking up from a coma, or that we've been in suspended animation. I actually didn't ask you this yesterday Misato, but do you remember dreaming anything?"  
"所有回来的人都有类似的病症。定向障碍，无法说话，身体也萎缩了；这一切都像是刚从昏迷中醒来，或者我们经历了休眠。昨天我其实没问你，美里，你还记得梦到过什么吗？"

"Yeah, in a way. I felt like I had been dreaming, or that I was waking up from a dream, but I can't remember what it was."  
“是啊，某种程度上。我感觉自己像是在做梦，或者从梦中醒来，但我记不清梦的内容了。”

"Everybody else has had the same experience, but I suppose I should start bringing you up to speed on a couple things."  
“其他人也有同样的经历，但我想我应该开始让你了解一些事情。”

Clearing her throat, Ritsuko continued talking.  
清了清嗓子，律子继续说道。

"It's been six days now since everybody started appearing on the beach, nearly all in groups. Myself and Kaji were in the first and second groups respectively. Everybody that has returned so far have all been Nerv employee. With the new group that just arrived recently, the total number of people here is one hundred and thirty."  
"自从大家开始出现在海滩上已经过去六天了，几乎所有人都是成群结队地出现。我和卡吉分别在第一和第二批。到目前为止，所有返回的人都是 NERV 的员工。随着最近新一批人的到来，这里总人数已经达到了一百三十人。"

"Is it possible that others have returned before us?"  
"有没有可能在我们之前已经有人回来了？"

"If they did, they didn't stay in the city. There have been no other signs of humans staying here before we started arriving. No, I'm sure that we are the first. Currently, we have people patrolling the beaches up and down in both directions since this area seems to be centered on where most are arriving. We've been scavenging for food as best as we can, but any perishables have long since deteriorated. I'm guessing that several months have passed since Third Impact happened at the very least, possibly as much as a year."  
"如果有，他们也没有留在城里。在我们开始抵达之前，没有其他人类在此停留的迹象。不，我确信我们是第一批。目前，我们有人沿着海滩上下两个方向巡逻，因为这个区域似乎是大多数人抵达的中心地带。我们一直在尽力搜寻食物，但任何易腐烂的物品早已腐坏。我猜测，至少在第三次冲击发生后的几个月已经过去了，甚至可能长达一年。"

"Kaji said the supplies are low right now," said Misato.  
“加持说现在补给不足，”美里说道。

"We're rationing everything as best as possible, but with more people returning every day it's becoming more difficult. If civilians start returning, I can only imagine the problems we'll begin to have. So far, everybody has been understanding, but if this continues, people may begin to clash over the simplest of things."  
“我们尽可能地实行配给制，但随着每天越来越多的人回来，情况变得越来越困难。如果平民也开始返回，我只能想象我们将面临的问题。到目前为止，大家都还能理解，但如果这种情况持续下去，人们可能会因为最简单的事情而发生冲突。”

"I'm assuming you have a plan then?" asked Misato.  
“那我想你已经有计划了吧？”美里问道。

"I do, and it's a good thing you returned when you did. Kaji, show her the map."  
"我确实需要，你回来的正是时候。加持，给她看地图。"

Kaji handed the map over to Misato, and glanced over it, quickly noticing what the many markings on the map indicated.  
加持将地图递给美里，她迅速扫了一眼，很快就注意到了地图上众多标记所指示的内容。

"These are all access points into the Geofront," stated Misato.  
"这些都是通往地底都市的入口，""美里说道。

"Exactly. The power grid is down across all of Tokyo-3, but the Geofront has its own generators and backups incase those fail. With a small party of Nerv personal, we should be able to get them running again. Getting the electricity back would be a moral boost, and there should be plenty of supplies down there as well."  
“正是如此。整个东京-3 的电网都瘫痪了，但地底都市有自己的发电机和备用系统以防万一。只要带上几名 NERV 人员，我们应该能重新启动它们。恢复电力不仅能提振士气，那里应该还有充足的物资。”

"I assume that you want me to lead this expedition?" said Misato.  
“我想你是希望我带队去执行这次任务吧？”美里说道。

"Both you and Kaji. I'd go as well, but I'll have to stay here for the people returning. Besides, you're now the highest ranking person here at the moment."  
“你和加持都去。我也想一起去，但我得留在这里接待返回的人员。而且，你现在是我们这里职位最高的人。”

"I am? What about the Commander, and Fuyutsuki?"  
"我是吗？那司令和冬月呢？"

"There hasn't been any sign of the commander, and Fuyutsuki returned a few days before you, but he hasn't said much to me or anyone. He has relinquished his role as vice commander as well, so you're now the highest ranking member here."  
"司令至今杳无音讯，而冬月在你回来前几天就回来了，但他没怎么跟我或其他人说话。他也已经辞去了副司令的职务，所以你现在是我们这里最高级别的成员。"

"But Ritsuko, you-" "但律子，你——"

"First and foremost, I'm a doctor and a scientist," said Ritsuko, cutting her off. "You want my medical or scientific opinion, that I can give. I'm not a leader, and these six days juggling both has wore me down. That duty is yours Misato, whether you want it or not. You commanded at Nerv when you had to, and this is no different."  
"首先，我是一名医生和科学家，"律子打断她道，"你需要我的医学或科学意见，我可以提供。我不是领导者，这六天来兼顾两者已让我筋疲力尽。这项责任是你的，美里，无论你是否愿意。你在 Nerv 需要时指挥过，现在也一样。"

Misato's eyes swiveled to Kaji as though asking her to back her up, but he just waived his hands in front of his face and said, "Don't look at me. I was never directly affiliated with Nerv in the first place, and only gave my support when it was needed."  
美里的目光转向凯吉，似乎在请求他支持，但他只是摆手挡在脸前说："别看我。我从未直接隶属于 Nerv，只是在需要时提供过支持。"

"Useless," complained Misato.  
"没用，"美里抱怨道。

Looking from one to the other though, she finally gave up.  
她来回打量着，最终还是放弃了。

"Fine, you win. I'll do this, but I want both of your assistance and help when needed.."  
“好吧，你赢了。我会做这件事，但需要时我要求你们俩都来帮忙。”

---

Two days later, when Misato was fully rested and her body had recovered, her and Kaji started on there way to the Geofront with six other people who had worked in the maintenance department. They walked at a distance away from the maintenance crew, letting them decide based on the map what emergency access to enter the Geofront from. In reality, there were many choices to chose from. Due to the attack on Nerv, all of the main access tunnels leading to the Geofront had been assaulted, most of the gates having been throughly destroyed, allowing large groups of soldiers to infiltrate. Misato didn't just plan on restoring power while they were there, but assessing the overall damage to the Geofront.  
两天后，当美里完全恢复了体力，她和加持与另外六名曾在维修部门工作的人员一起前往地底都市。他们与维修队伍保持一定距离，让他们根据地图决定从哪个紧急入口进入地底都市。实际上，选择很多。由于 NERV 遭受的攻击，通往地底都市的主要通道都被破坏了，大多数大门被彻底摧毁，使得大批士兵得以渗透。美里不仅计划在那里恢复电力，还要评估地底都市的整体受损情况。

Based on the current path they were taking, Misato had an idea of where they were headed.  
根据他们目前行进的路径，美里大致猜到了他们的目的地。

As she had assumed, they were making for a small building disguised as a retail store that in reality, was owned by Nerv. It was just one of the many buildings used in emergencies if the power grid across Tokyo-3 failed. She was sure that the thought of entering through one of the main gates had appeared in the minds of the maintenance crew, but they couldn't be sure how badly the damage was there. The coalition of soldiers could have likely destroyed the entrances, hoping to trap Nerv employees inside the facility, so this was a for sure option.  
正如她所料，他们正前往一座伪装成零售店的小型建筑，实则归 NERV 所有。这只是众多在东京-3 电力网络失效时用于紧急情况的建筑之一。她确信维修团队曾考虑过从主入口进入，但他们无法确定那里的损坏程度。联合士兵很可能已经摧毁了入口，企图困住 NERV 的员工，因此这是一个确定可行的选择。

That being said, the building had suffered severe damage from the fight between Unit-01 and the Mass-Produced Evangelions. Much of the right side of the building had collapsed on itself, and broken pieces of brick littered the front entrance.  
尽管如此，这座建筑在初号机与量产型使徒的战斗中遭受了严重破坏。建筑右侧大部分已经坍塌，破碎的砖块散落在前门入口处。

The eight of them stepped around the hazardous obstacles, and entered the darkened ruin, turning on their flashlights as they did. Misato had never actually been through this access point before, though she knew about it, and each of the maintenance crew certainly had used it before since it was their job to keep points like this operational.  
他们八人绕过危险的障碍物，进入了昏暗的废墟，随即打开手电筒。美里从未真正从这个入口进入过，尽管她知道它的存在，但每位维修人员肯定都曾使用过它，因为这是他们保持此类入口正常运作的工作。

The interior was a mess, with broken wooden shelves and a random assortment of objects. It was a cheap shop, like a second hand store, which made it not stand out, though this was of course the point.  
内部一片狼藉，破碎的木架和杂乱无章的物品散落一地。这是一家廉价的商店，像二手店一样，这使得它并不显眼，当然，这也是其目的所在。

Navigating around the scattered shelves, Kaji and Misato followed the crew who seemed to know this place even if they were blindfolded into the back where the employee lounge was. Opening a side door, they proceeded down a narrow staircase into the basement. Here, the brick and mortar store disappeared above them, and the walls were replaced by thick metal walls. It was like a small basement, about thirty feet in diameter, and devoid of anything except a single large metal door at the far side of the room. The door had a manual crank on it, similar to those seen on battleships. One of the crewman, presumably the strongest of the six, placed both his on the crank and began turning it, slowly opening the metal door and half a minute later, revealed a metal stairway that went down into the darkness.  
穿过散乱的书架，Kaji 和 Misato 跟着那些似乎即便蒙上眼睛也能熟悉这个地方的员工，来到了后面的员工休息室。打开一扇侧门，他们沿着狭窄的楼梯下到地下室。在这里，上面的砖石店铺消失了，取而代之的是厚重的金属墙。这个地下室大约三十英尺直径，空无一物，除了房间远端的一扇大金属门。门上有一个手动曲柄，类似于战舰上的那种。其中一名船员，大概是六人中最强壮的，双手放在曲柄上，开始转动它，慢慢地打开金属门，半分钟后，露出一道通往黑暗中的金属楼梯。

"Commander?" asked the crewman who had just opened the door as he turned towards Misato.  
“指挥官？”刚打开门的船员转向 Misato 问道。

Misato felt it would take sometime to get used to being referred to as the commander, but she nodded all the same, and took the lead down the staircase, followed closely by Kaji.  
Misato 觉得要习惯被称为指挥官还需要一段时间，但她还是点了点头，率先走下楼梯，Kaji 紧随其后。

Many minutes passed with only the sound of their footsteps echoing off the walls as they continued walking deeper under Tokyo-3. Slowly however, Misato began to feel a soft breeze hitting her face. Finally, the beam of her flashlight hit a door at the end of the long staircase. Turning the doorknob, it swung open, bathing her in warm sunlight.  
许多分钟过去了，只有他们的脚步声在墙壁间回响，他们继续深入东京-3 的地下。然而，慢慢地，美里开始感觉到一阵轻柔的微风拂过她的脸颊。终于，她的手电筒光束照到了长楼梯尽头的一扇门。转动门把手，门缓缓打开，温暖的阳光洒在她身上。

The eight of them stepped out onto a small platform, several feet above the ground. Sunlight streamed down through the gaping hole in the Geofront, and for a moment, they took in the scenery. The grass, trees, and lake were all Misato remembered it as if she had just been here yesterday, and the pyramid of Nerv was no different. This wasn't entirely true however, as even from here, the aftermath of the damage done to the Geofront from the battle could be seen.  
他们八人踏出到一个小平台上，离地面有几英尺高。阳光从地底都市的巨大裂口中倾泻而下，有那么一刻，他们欣赏着周围的景色。草地、树木和湖泊都如美里记忆中那样，仿佛她昨天才来过这里，NERV 的三角锥建筑也没有变化。但这并不完全准确，因为即使在这里，也能看到战斗对地底都市造成的破坏痕迹。

Turning towards the others, she beckoned them to follow her, and walked down the winding metal staircase. As she began reaching the bottom however, she noticed something unusual. The handrail, and many parts of the metal stairway were rusted brown and orange. Ritsuko had mentioned that the possibility of several months to a year had passed since humans had vanished from the earth, but was this amount of rust normal for that passage of time?  
她转向其他人，示意他们跟上，然后走下蜿蜒的金属楼梯。然而，当她开始接近底部时，她注意到了一些不寻常的东西。扶手和金属楼梯的许多部分都生锈成了棕色和橙色。赤木律子曾提到，自人类从地球上消失以来，可能已经过去了数月到一年的时间，但这种程度的锈蚀对于这段时间来说正常吗？

When she reached the bottom of the stairway though, something else struck her as odd. While a concrete path has once been here, and while it wouldn't be unusual for it to be concealed by the  
然而，当她到达楼梯底部时，另一件事引起了她的注意。虽然这里曾经有一条混凝土小路，而且被茂密的草丛遮盖并不奇怪，但这些草却高过了她的头顶。站在四十英尺高的地方，很难判断下方物体的高度，但这正常吗？

overgrown grass, the grass was well above her head. Forty feet above the ground, it was more difficult to establish the height of things below you, but was this normal?  
茂密的草丛，这些草却高过了她的头顶。站在四十英尺高的地方，很难判断下方物体的高度，但这正常吗？

"It's bothering you too, isn't it?" said Kaji pointedly.  
"你也觉得困扰，对吧？" 加持一针见血地说道。

"So you noticed as well," mumbled Misato. "What do you think?"  
"你也注意到了啊，" 美里咕哝着，"你觉得呢？"

"I've seen a lot more of the city than you have, and honestly, I think Ritsuko was being rather conservative in her assessment. The rust in particular worries me. I've seen many cars throughout the city who's paint has completely rusted off, and that would of course be because they're out in the open and get rained on constantly. The railing though is far enough away from the hole left by the N2 bomb that it would take a considerable amount of rain and wind to reach this point. Plants need both water and direct sunlight to grow, and the grass here will only get hit by the sun as its setting for maybe an hour everyday, which of course doesn't account for cloud cover. As we near the center of the Geofront, I'm guessing the grass will be even taller."  
"我比你更了解这座城市，说实话，我觉得律子在评估时相当保守。尤其是锈蚀问题让我很担心。我见过城里很多车的漆面完全锈蚀掉了，当然这是因为它们暴露在外，经常被雨淋。但这个栏杆离 N2 炸弹留下的洞口相当远，需要相当多的雨水和风才能到达这里。植物需要水和直射阳光才能生长，这里的草每天只能得到大约一小时的夕阳照射，这还没算上云层的遮挡。随着我们接近地表的中心，我猜草会更高。"

"Then how long do you think we were gone for?" asked Misato.  
“那你觉得我们离开了多久？”美里问道。

"I don't know," said Kaji, shaking his head. "But I think it's more than a year."  
“我不知道，”加持摇着头说，“但我觉得超过一年了。”

Misato didn't say anything, but she began worrying about the future. How long had they been gone? Could humanity realistically continue living in such a state?  
美里没有说话，但她开始担忧未来。他们究竟离开了多久？人类在这种状态下还能继续生存下去吗？

"Well, one step at a time I suppose," said Kaji. "Before we start worrying about anything else, we first need to try and get the power back to the Geofront."  
"嗯，一步一步来吧，" 加持说道。"在我们担心其他事情之前，首先得设法恢复地底都市的电力。"

"Right," mumbled Misato, pushing her worries to the back of her mind.  
"没错，" 美里喃喃自语，将忧虑暂时抛诸脑后。

Though the path was concealed by the grass, each of them had treaded on it enough times to know where it was headed, and it wasn't as if they couldn't guess. The large pyramid which was the most distinct landmark in the Geofront was what they were aiming for.  
虽然小径被草丛遮掩，但他们每个人都已经走过太多次，知道它通往何方，而且他们也能猜到。地底都市中最显眼的地标——那座巨大的金字塔，正是他们的目标。

After several minutes of walking and fighting there way through the tall grass which reached over there heads, they finally reached the entrance to Nerv. The front doors had been smashed open, and what they at first thought to be more rust around the entrance, turned out to be dried blood. They were reminded again of the battle that had happened here, though for them, hardly a week had passed within their own memories.  
经过几分钟的跋涉与穿越高过头顶的草丛，他们终于抵达了 NERV 的入口。前门已被砸开，起初他们以为是入口处的锈迹，结果却是干涸的血迹。这让他们再次想起这里发生过的战斗，尽管对他们来说，这不过是在自己的记忆中过去了不到一周的时间。

"C'mon," said Misato as she stepped through the doorframe.  
“快点，”美里说着，跨过了门框。

The automatic moving walkways were of course shut off without power, so they walked the length of the long entrance way, noting the many patches of dried blood, shell casings that littered the floor, and bullet holes that marked the walls. Misato couldn't help but inwardly shudder as she thought of the brutality orchestrated here.  
自动移动步道当然因为断电而关闭了，于是他们沿着长长的入口通道步行，注意到地面上散布的干血迹、弹壳，以及墙壁上的弹孔。美里不禁在心里为这里的残酷景象而战栗。

They were on the ground floor, or what could be viewed as the very center of Dogma. With the elevators not working, they used an emergency stairwell that led further into the complex. At this point, Misato let the maintenance crew take the lead since they knew the in and outs of this place, and followed their lead.  
他们位于底层，或者说可以视为 Dogma 的核心地带。由于电梯无法使用，他们利用一条紧急楼梯深入建筑内部。此时，美里让维修团队走在前面，因为他们对这里了如指掌，她便紧随其后。

The main generators and backup generators were in separate locations, and the maintenance crew didn't even bother to go for the main ones. It would be too much to hope that the soldiers hadn't manages to sabotage the main generators, but the backups would hopefully be fine.  
主发电机和备用发电机分别位于不同位置，维修团队甚至没有考虑去主发电机那里。指望士兵们没有破坏主发电机未免太过奢望，但备用发电机应该还能正常运作。

Stepping into a narrow tunnel that ran the length of the Geofront, one of the many that was used by the maintenance crew to move around quickly, Misato and Kaji followed the others to a single door. One of the crewmen opened it, and they entered a large room.  
走进一条狭窄的隧道，这是维修团队用来快速移动的众多通道之一，贯穿整个 Geofront，美里和加持跟随其他人来到一扇门前。一名维修人员打开门，他们进入了一个宽敞的房间。

Five enormous generators stretched to the end of the room, each nearly thirty feet tall, and twenty feet wide. Misato let her eyes trail over the large generators before her eyes moved to the maintenance crew who had already begun assessing the situation. Everything was manually operated in here, but the problem was that the back up generators were automatically supposed to start incase the primarily ones failed.  
五台巨大的发电机延伸至房间尽头，每台高达近三十英尺，宽二十英尺。美里目光掠过这些庞大的发电机，随后转向已经开始评估情况的维修团队。这里的一切都是手动操作的，但问题在于，备用发电机本应在主发电机失效时自动启动。

Misato stood there and watched as they began moving around the large room, the six of them examining each of the five generators. From the snatches of conversation she heard, it appeared that at the very least, they weren't tampered with. Slowly, the six of them went off in opposite directions after reaching some sort of agreement. Two of them began accessing panels near two of the generators, and examining the wires there while another entered a large man sized duct near another generator. Misato watched them begin working, and turned towards Kaji with a confused expression, wondering whether she was supposed to say anything to them, but Kaji was looking pointedly over Misato's shoulder. Turning around, Misato saw of the crew walking towards her, the only female in the group.  
美里站在那里，看着他们开始在大房间里四处移动，六个人分别检查着五台发电机。从她听到的零星对话来看，至少可以确定这些发电机没有被篡改。慢慢地，六个人在达成某种共识后各自朝相反的方向散开。其中两人开始接近两台发电机旁的控制面板，检查那里的线路，而另一人则钻进了靠近另一台发电机的大型人形管道。美里看着他们开始工作，转向加持，脸上带着困惑的表情，不知道是否应该对他们说些什么，但加持却明显地越过美里的肩膀看向别处。美里转过身，看到团队中唯一的女成员正向她走来。

"Commander?" “指挥官？”

"Just call me Misato," sighed Misato. "So, have you figured out what's wrong? Why haven't the backups started yet?"  
“直接叫我美里吧。”美里叹了口气，“那么，你们找出问题所在了吗？为什么备用系统还没有启动？”

"No," said the woman, shaking her head. "The generators themselves don't have any problems. It's difficult to be sure without a more thorough examination of the power grid, but we think that during the attack, something must have disrupted the backups from starting. All of the generators here run on hydroelectric power from Tokyo-3's bay, so somewhere along the line the connection was disrupted somehow."  
"不，" 女人摇着头说，"发电机本身没有问题。没有对电网进行更彻底的检查，很难确定，但我们认为在袭击期间，某些因素可能阻碍了备用电源的启动。这里所有的发电机都依赖于来自第三新东京湾的水力发电，所以某个环节的连接一定被某种方式打断了。

"Do you have an idea for how long it'll take to get it back up?"  
"您有大概的估计，需要多长时间才能恢复供电吗？

"Again without an idea of how sever the damage is here, or to the rest of the Geofront, we can't be sure. At the very least, the damage is centralized here. The cables run deep underground, so even with the destruction to the city, it wouldn't affect it on that end. Most likely the soldiers cut the power at some point, likely with help from inside."  
"再次强调，没有具体了解这里的损害程度，或是地底都市其他部分的状况，我们无法确定。至少，损害集中在这里。电缆深埋地下，所以即便城市遭受破坏，那端也不会受到影响。最有可能的是，士兵们在某个时刻切断了电源，很可能得到了内部的帮助。

Misato had long since known that there were infiltrators from Seele inside Nerv, so this didn't come as much of a surprise.  
美里早就知道 Seele 在 NERV 内部有渗透者，所以这并不让她感到太意外。

"Do you need more people to help with this?"  
“你需要更多人手来协助吗？”

"As many as possible." “越多越好。”

"Right. I'd already planned on getting an accurate damage assessment of the Geofront and Dogma, so I suppose this handles both cases. Don't push yourselves, and work in shifts to alleviate the work load. I'll send a few more personal down here when I return to the camp."  
"好的。我原本就计划对 Geofront 和 Dogma 进行准确的损害评估，所以这应该能同时解决两个问题。不要勉强自己，轮班工作以减轻负担。我回到营地后会再派几个人下来。"

"Thank you comman-Misato."  
"谢谢你，指挥官——美里。"

The woman hurried of without another word, assisting the others with the workload.  
女人匆匆离开，没有再多说一句话，帮助其他人分担工作量。

"Not bad Commander," muttered Kaji with a slight smile.  
"不错嘛，指挥官。" 加持轻声笑道。

"Don't you go talking like that as well," groaned Misato as she turned to leave.  
"你也别这么说。" 美里叹了口气，转身离开。

Both of them left, walking back up the emergency stairwell. Misato had expected things to go a lot slower, but they had gotten here sooner than she had expected, and it couldn't have even been noon yet.  
两人一同走回紧急楼梯，美里本以为事情会进展得更慢些，但没想到比预期来得早，甚至还没到中午。

"Hey Kaji?" "嘿，Kaji？"

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Mind if we make a detour?"  
"介意我们绕个路吗？"

"No, I don't," he answered, knowing fully well where she wanted to go.  
"不介意，我明白你想去哪儿。"

Minutes later, they both stood in the middle of a hallway, staring a duct, and in particular, the dried blood that surrounded it.  
几分钟后，他们俩站在走廊中央，盯着通风管道，特别是周围干涸的血迹。

"It's hard to believe, isn't it, muttered Kaji.  
“很难相信，是吧？”加持低声说道。

Misato didn't say anything as she continued staring at the dried blood. This was where both her and Kaji had once "died" yet here they were standing side by side again. It was a very surreal feeling to be staring at the spot where there deaths actually occurred.  
美里没有说话，继续盯着那干涸的血迹。这里曾是她和加持“死去”的地方，而如今他们再次并肩站在这里。盯着他们实际死亡的地点，这种感觉非常超现实。

"Did I make the right decision in letting Asuka fight?" asked Misato almost inaudibly.  
"我让明日香去战斗，这个决定对吗？" 美里几乎听不见地问道。

"If you hadn't, she would have likely found another way."  
"如果你没让她去，她很可能会找到其他方式。"

"What would Shinji have said in that moment though? Surely he wouldn't have allowed it."  
"但那一刻，真嗣会怎么说呢？他肯定不会允许的。"

"Whatever he would have done doesn't matter, since you were the one to make the decision. Are you blaming yourself for what happened between them?"  
“无论他原本会做什么都无关紧要，因为是你做出了决定。你是在为发生在他们之间的事情自责吗？”

No, Misato didn't think she was, not in that regard at least. However, she couldn't help but feel that things weren't right not having them here right now. Shinji and Asuka had just as much a role in things that were happening right now as Misato herself. Since they both weren't here though, Misato couldn't help but feel some twinge of guilt. If she hadn't relied on Shinji so heavily, or allowed Asuka to pilot Unit-02, would they be here? What had happened after she parted ways with Asuka in the first place?  
不，美里并不认为自己在这方面有责任，至少不是那种意义上的。然而，她无法不觉得现在他们不在这里是不对的。真嗣和明日香在当前发生的事情中同样扮演着重要角色，就像美里自己一样。既然他们都不在这里，美里不禁感到一丝内疚。如果她没有如此依赖真嗣，或者允许明日香驾驶二号机，他们会不会在这里？在她与明日香最初分别后，究竟发生了什么？

"Misato?" asked Kaji, noting the worried expression on her face.  
"“美里？” 加持注意到她脸上的忧虑表情，问道。

"...Sorry," she replied. "Just remembering some things. I think I'm ready to leave."  
"...对不起，"她回答道。"只是想起了一些事情。我想我已经准备好离开了。"

Kaji nodded, and followed Misato back the way they came.  
加持点点头，跟着美里原路返回。

It took them roughly two hours of backtracking there way through the Geofront and navigating there way through the city until they were back at their camp near the beach. Thankfully, Kaji knew the city fairly well even in its ruined state, so they made it back without much difficulty. The sun had just reached its apex in the sky when Misato found Ritsuko in her tent, going over a notebook she had been writing in recently.  
他们花了大约两个小时的时间在 Geofront 中回溯，并在城市中导航，直到回到海滩附近的营地。幸运的是，加持对这座城市即使在其毁坏的状态下也相当熟悉，所以他们没有遇到太多困难就回到了营地。当美里在帐篷里找到正在翻阅最近一直在写的笔记本的律子时，太阳刚刚升到天空的最高点。

"That didn't take very long?" said Ritsuko when she saw them enter through the tent flap. "I take it you didn't run into any problems?"  
"那没花多少时间嘛？" 看到他们从帐篷口进来，律子说道，"看来你们没遇到什么麻烦？"

"That depends on what you mean," sighed Misato as she sank down into a foldable chair. "We found the generators without any difficulty, but the crewmen say it may take them sometime to get them up and running. They aren't sure what the problem is without a more thorough analysis of the damages done to Nerv and the Geofront, so I'll be sending some more personnel down there in the evening."  
"这要看你怎么定义了，" 美里叹了口气，坐进一把折叠椅，"我们找到发电机没费什么劲，但船员们说可能需要一段时间才能让它们运转起来。他们不确定问题所在，需要对 NERV 和地底都市的损坏进行更彻底的分析，所以我晚上会再派些人下去。"

"Can't say I didn't expect that," shrugged Ritsuko. "Well, if it's any consolation, we've managed to get a few vehicles that were sheltered from the rain running, so we can begin sending more people to the Geofront. Besides that, there was something that was reported to me shortly after you two left."  
"我倒也不意外，" 律子耸耸肩，"不过，说点安慰的话，我们已经设法让几辆避雨的车子启动了，可以开始向地底都市增派人手。另外，你们俩离开后不久，我收到了一份报告。"

"What is it?" asked Misato.  
“怎么了？”美里问道。

"One of our men has found what appears to be the remains of Unit-02."  
“我们的人发现了一些似乎是二号机残骸的东西。”

Kaji could tell that Misato tensed up beside him, and thought for a moment that she was about to run out of the tent after demanding to know where it was, but she managed to keep calm.  
加持能感觉到美里在他身旁紧张起来，他以为她会立刻冲出帐篷，追问残骸在哪里，但她设法保持了冷静。

"What is its state?" asked Misato hesitantly.  
"它的状态如何？" 美里犹豫地问道。

"He didn't give a very accurate picture in that regard. He's not one that normally associates himself with the Evangelions, so only knows of them from a very vague standpoint, but he gave me the directions to the remains."  
"在这方面，他并没有给出非常准确的描述。他通常不与福音战士打交道，所以只是从一个非常模糊的角度了解它们，但他给了我前往残骸的指示。"

"Where are they?" asked Misato, finally asking the question she had been wanting to ask from the moment Ritsuko told her this.  
"它们在哪里？" 美里终于问出了从听到律子告诉她这件事起就一直想问的问题。

"I'll get to that in a minute," said Ritsuko, but when Misato went to protest this by opening her mouth, Ritsuko continued with, "there is something else I wanted to discuss with you before you leave."  
"我一会儿就会讲到那件事，" 丽素说，但当美里正要开口抗议时，丽素继续说道，"在你离开之前，我还有其他事情想和你讨论。"

Misato surely didn't want to waste anymore time talking if there was even the slightest possibility to discover anything which may have happened to Asuka, but she held her tongue.  
如果有一丝可能发现关于明日香下落的线索，美里当然不想再浪费任何时间在谈话上，但她还是忍住了。

"As you know, I've been fulfilling my role as a doctor and questioning every single person that returns and ends up back here in Tokyo-3. In doing so, I've been slowly able to piece together the events that happened during the attack on the Geofront, and have a fairly accurate understanding of what happened that day."  
"如你所知，我一直履行着作为医生的职责，询问每一个返回并最终回到第三新东京市的人。通过这样做，我逐渐拼凑出了攻击地底都市那天发生的事件，对那天的情况有了相当准确的了解。"

"What are getting at?" asked Misato, beginning to lose her patience.  
"你到底想说什么？" 美里开始失去耐心问道。

"Fine, I can see that you are anxious for me to hurry through this, so I'll say this much at least. Something happened at the end of the battle between Unit-01 and the Mass Produced Evangelions, likely helping to create the situation that we are now in."  
"好吧，我看得出你急于让我快点讲完，所以至少这一点我要说清楚。在零号机与量产型 EVA 战斗的最后发生了一些事情，很可能促成了我们现在所处的局面。"

"And Shinji-" "那真嗣呢——"

"Was likely at the center of it all," finished Ritsuko. "I do not know what happened during that moment since everything was chaotic on our end, and the command center was being overrun at the time. Unfortunately, we have very little knowledge of what happened after both Unit-01 and Unit-02 engaged the Mass Produced Evangelions."  
"很可能就是这一切的中心，" 丽津子总结道，"我不知道那一刻发生了什么，因为我们的情况一片混乱，指挥中心当时也被攻陷了。遗憾的是，我们对初号机和二号机与量产型使徒交战后的情况知之甚少。"

"So Asuka made it to Shinji's side," spoke Misato.  
"所以明日香赶到了真嗣身边，" 美里说道。"

"She did. Both yours and Kaji's efforts weren't in vain."  
"确实如此。你和加持的努力并没有白费。"

This helped to improve Misato mood slightly, but she still had more pressing matters to attend to.  
这稍微改善了美里心情，但她仍有更紧迫的事情要处理。

"Without Shinji here though, we don't have anyway of confirming this," said Misato suddenly.  
“不过，没有真嗣在，我们无法确认这一点，”美里突然说道。

"Well, true," sighed Ritsuko. "There are many things I would like to ask him if I got the chance. Well, that's all I wanted to say, but I expect to hear something reassuring after you investigate Unit-02."  
“嗯，确实，”律子叹了口气。“如果有机会，我有很多问题想问他。好了，我要说的就这些，但我期待你在调查二号机后能听到一些令人安心的话。”

"I will," said Misato as she stood up to leave. She glanced over at Kaji, thinking that he would accompany her.  
"我会去的，"美里说着站起身准备离开。她瞥了一眼加持，心想他会陪她一起去。

"Sorry," he said, "I've got something other matters to attend to, so I won't be accompanying you this time."  
"抱歉，"他说，"我有些其他事情要处理，这次就不能陪你去了。"

"Right," said Misato, thinking that she would have preferred his company of she was honest. She didn't know what she expected to find, but she wanted to be prepared for the worst.  
"好吧，"美里说，心里诚实地说她其实更希望有他陪伴。她不知道自己期待找到什么，但她想做好最坏的准备。

After Misato had left however, Kaji turned to Ritsuko and asked, "How long do you think we've actually been gone for?"  
然而，在美里离开后，加持转向律子问道：“你觉得我们实际上离开了多久？”

"Where is this coming from?"  
“这从何说起？”

"You can't honestly expect people to not be able to not put two and two together. The decomposition of food, oxidizing of metal, plant life that has grown in abundance without humans hands to tend them. Six months is hardly long enough for these things, well, the food wouldn't take long I suppose, but other than that..."  
“你不能真的指望人们无法将这些线索联系起来。食物的腐烂、金属的氧化、植物在没有人类照料下大量生长。六个月对这些现象来说时间太短了，嗯，食物腐烂可能不需要太久，但除此之外……”

"You weren't secretly affiliated with Nerv for nothing I see," sighed Ritsuko."  
"看来你并非毫无缘由地秘密隶属于 Nerv，" 律子叹息道。

Standing up, she left the comfortable feel of the chair, and stepped into the open sun while Kaji followed her. All around them, people continued moving, each of them shouldering some burden that they were assigned. That last remnants of humanity has been reduced to scavengers.  
她站起身，离开了那把舒适的椅子，踏入阳光下，加持紧随其后。四周的人们依旧在忙碌，每个人都肩负着被分配的负担。人类最后的残余已沦为拾荒者。

"I don't honestly know how much time has passed, and that is what makes me worried the most," whispered Ritsuko.  
"老实说，我不知道已经过去了多少时间，而这正是最让我担忧的，" 律子低声说道。

"You don't even have a guess?" asked Kaji.  
"你连个猜测都没有吗？" 加持问道。

"More than a year I think. If we can get the power back, then I may be able to get a rough estimate, but that's all."  
"我想超过一年了吧。如果能恢复电力，我或许能给出一个大致的估计，但也就这样了。"

Kaji and Ritsuko watched the many Nerv employees continuing working around them, both wondering how humanity could continue functioning as such.  
加持和律子看着周围众多 NERV 员工继续工作，两人都在想，人类究竟是如何在这样的状态下继续运作的。

---

Using the map Ritsuko had given her, it didn't take long for Misato to arrive by vehicle. She was driving a green jeep that somebody has found during the many travels through the ruined city, and Misato was thankful for this. On foot, it would have taken her several hours.  
借助律子给她的地图，Misato 很快就驾车抵达了目的地。她驾驶的是一辆在废墟城市中多次穿梭时找到的绿色吉普，对此 Misato 深感庆幸。如果步行，她可能需要好几个小时。

From where their camp was on the beach, it was difficult to tell how bad the state of Tokyo-3 was. While driving though, Misato began to realize just how bad the damage was. A large part of the city had of course been destroyed when Unit 00 was contaminated and subsequently destroyed, but the ensuing battle between Unit 01 and the Mass Produced Evangelions had turned this section of Tokyo-3 into a wasteland similar to apocalyptic movies. The destroyed remains of buildings lay on there side. Entire sections of roadways had been gouged out of the earth, and large indents into the ground indicated where the Evangelions once stood.  
从他们在海滩上的营地望去，很难判断东京-3 的状况有多糟糕。然而，当 Misato 驾车行驶时，她开始意识到破坏的严重程度。当然，当零号机被污染并随后被摧毁时，城市的大部分地区已经化为废墟，但紧接着初号机与量产型使徒之间的战斗，将东京-3 的这一区域变成了类似末日电影中的荒地。建筑的残骸横七竖八地倒在地上，道路的整段被从地面上挖出，巨大的地面凹陷显示了使徒曾经站立的位置。

Misato took all this in as she drove, carefully navigating her way around the ruins until she reached the area that the map indicated where Unit 02 was. As Misato stepped out of the jeep though, she couldn't help but inhale sharply at the sight before her. Calling it the remains of Unit 02 didn't do it justice: there was almost nothing left of the Evangelion.  
美里一边开车，一边将这一切尽收眼底，小心翼翼地绕过废墟，直到她到达地图指示的 02 号机所在区域。然而，当美里从吉普车上下来时，她不禁倒吸一口凉气，眼前的景象让她震惊。称其为 02 号机的残骸并不贴切：这台福音战士几乎什么都没剩下。

Initially, Unit 02 had been severely damaged by Unit 01 and Shinji as they fought while descending into Terminal Dogma. Tabris, the last Angel had of course been controlling it at the time, and Shinji had seen no way of subduing it then to tear off both its arms. After the battle, Unit 02 had been repaired, but only to the point of the right arm functioning again, and Asuka had left to fight with Shinji in this damaged state. But that state couldn't compare to what Misato saw now. The only way of describing it was a savage mangling.  
起初，02 号机在与 01 号机和真嗣在进入最终教条区时激战时遭受了重创。当时，最后的使徒塔布里斯当然在控制着它，而真嗣当时只能通过撕掉它的双臂来制服它。战斗结束后，02 号机虽然得到了修复，但仅限于右臂再次运作，而明日香则带着这种受损状态去与真嗣并肩作战。但这种状态与美里现在所见的情景相比，简直是小巫见大巫。唯一能形容它的方式就是野蛮的蹂躏。

Unit 02 was nearly unrecognizable. The entire chest cavity had been ripped open, the large organs long decayed, and the ribcage had been ripped apart, pieces of bone littering the ground beside the fallen Eva Unit. The right arm had been torn off, though within Misato's vision, it was no where to be found. Both of the legs had been stripped clean of flesh as though carrion birds had defiled the body. The skull however was missing from the body, the head flung to the side where it lay on the ground. Two large punctures where the eyes were supposed to be went in one end of the skull and out the other. The top of the skull looked to have been crushed by a blunt instrument or a large fist, and the flesh had of course long decayed away, the metal red armor laying around the broken skull.  
02 号机几乎面目全非。整个胸腔被撕裂开来，巨大的器官早已腐烂，肋骨也被扯得支离破碎，骨头碎片散落在倒下的 EVA 机体旁。右臂被撕扯下来，但在美里视线所及之处，却不见其踪影。两条腿上的肉被剥得一干二净，仿佛食腐鸟类亵渎了这具躯体。然而，头骨却从身体上消失了，头部被甩到一边，躺在地上。两个巨大的孔洞贯穿了本应是眼睛的位置，从颅骨的一端穿透到另一端。颅顶似乎被钝器或巨拳击碎，而肉体自然早已腐烂殆尽，红色的装甲金属散落在破碎的头骨周围。

Misato felt a certain fear welling up inside her as she looked at the husk which was once Unit 02, long destroyed during the battle with the Mass Produced Eva Units. However, there was still one thing that she didn't immediately see, and that was the entry plug.  
美里凝视着曾经是 02 号机的残骸，心中涌起一股莫名的恐惧，这台机体在对抗量产型 EVA 的战斗中早已被摧毁。然而，有一件东西她并未立即发现，那就是插入栓。

Quickly jumping back in the jeep, she starting driving around the corpse of Unit 02, searching for the entry plug. What did she expect to find? Misato wasn't sure whether she even wanted to find it or not, worried what the inside might tell her. However, if there was even the slightest possibility she could learn something about Asuka, she felt it was her duty to do so.  
她迅速跳回吉普车，开始绕着二号机残骸行驶，寻找插入栓。她期望找到什么呢？美里不确定自己是否真的想找到它，担心内部可能透露的信息。然而，如果有哪怕一丝可能了解明日香的情况，她觉得这是自己的责任。

Driving in a large radius around Unit 02, she slowly began enlarging the circle she was driving in, but began to lose hope of ever finding it. When she was about to give up though, she spotted a cylindrical object far away from where Unit 02 lay. Speeding up, she realized why she hadn't seen it sooner since the white entry plug would certainly have stood out in the ruins.  
她围绕二号机画了一个大圈行驶，逐渐扩大搜索范围，但开始失去找到它的希望。就在她准备放弃时，她注意到远处有一个圆柱形物体，远离二号机所在的位置。加速驶去，她意识到为何之前没看到它，因为白色的插入栓在废墟中肯定非常显眼。

Stepping out of the jeep, she slowly walked towards the object, nearly buried in the dirt. The white had faded, replaced with a rusted hue, but Misato could see the words "Unit 02" plastered on the side though the letters were faded. Walking around the side, she tried pulling on the release that would open it, but it was firmly rusted closed. Misato stared at it for several seconds, knowing that it was futile to try to open it by herself. What she needed to do now was return to camp and get a team out her to open it.  
从吉普车下来，她缓缓走向那个几乎被泥土掩埋的物体。白色已经褪去，取而代之的是锈迹斑斑的色泽，但 Misato 仍能辨认出侧面模糊的“二号机”字样。她绕到侧面，试图拉动开启装置，但它已被锈死无法打开。Misato 凝视了几秒钟，明知单凭自己无法打开它。现在她需要做的是返回营地，带一支队伍来开启它。

As she hurried back to her jeep though, she felt that something was bothering her. Where were the Mass Produced Evangelions that Asuka had certainly fought? Where was Unit 01? What had happened to Shinji?  
然而，当她匆忙返回吉普车时，她感到有些事情困扰着她。那些量产型 EVA 在哪里？二号机在哪里？一��机呢？Shinji 又遭遇了什么？

Hundreds of questions began floating around Misato's mind, nearly all of which she couldn't find an answer for.  
无数问题开始在 Misato 的脑海中浮现，几乎所有问题她都找不到答案。

Unable to find an answer, she had no choice but to return to camp, dreading what she might find after the entry plug for Unit 02 was opened.  
无法找到答案，她别无选择，只能返回营地，担心打开 02 号机驾驶舱后会发现什么。

---

When Misato returned, she barged into Ritsuko's tent while she was talking to a patient who has recently been found on the beach earlier that day, and was immediately ordered out until she was done. When Ritsuko finally came out of the tent, she found Misato standing there impatiently waiting for her.  
当美里回来时，她闯进了律子的帐篷，当时律子正在与那天早些时候在海滩上被发现的一名病人交谈，并立即被命令离开直到她完成。当律子终于走出帐篷时，她发现美里正不耐烦地站在那里等她。

"You're back quicker than I anticipated. I take it you found something.  
“你回来得比我想象中快。看来你发现了什么。”

"Speaking hurriedly, Misato said, "Unit 02 is...there isn't much left. I don't know what happened during the battle, but it is unsalvageable, but that's not the important part. I found the entry plug, but it's rusted shut. Ritsuko, I need you to help me assemble a team to get it open. Whatever tools you need just find them, Asuka may-"  
"米萨托急忙说道，“二号机已经……所剩无几了。我不知道战斗中发生了什么，但它已经无法修复，但这不是重点。我找到了插入栓，但它锈死了。理津子，我需要你帮我组建一个团队把它打开。无论需要什么工具，尽快找到，明日香可能还……”

"Misato, even if we could assemble a team this quickly with the right tools and factoring in the little light left today, a week has passed since people started returning, and even if Asuka was trapped in there, she's likely-"  
"米萨托，即使我们能迅速集结一支配备合适工具的团队，考虑到今天剩下的光线时间，人们已经返回一周了，即使明日香被困在里面，她很可能……”

"Don't! Please don't say that..."  
"别！请不要说出来……”

Even though Misato said this, she recognized how hopeless it was to believe Asuka was waiting in the entry plug for rescue. LCL fluid could function as water in dire need, and passed through the lungs mimicking oxygen, but a week without food...that was pushing it.  
尽管美里这么说，她心里明白相信明日香会在插入栓里等待救援是多么无望。LCL 液体在紧急情况下可以充当水，通过肺部模拟氧气，但一周没有食物...这实在是太过勉强了。

"Even if she isn't there, some sign of her, that's all I want."  
“即使她不在那里，只要有她的任何迹象，我就满足了。”

"Even if it's something you don't want to see?" asked Ritsuko.  
“即使是你不想看到的东西？”律子问道。

"...Yes," replied Misato.  
"...是的，" 美里回答道。

Ritsuko watched her for several seconds before she sighed and said, "Alright. But it may be a few hours before everything will be ready. It just so happens that somebody found a hardware store earlier today and came back with a few things just as a precaution. I'll send a few more people back to grab a list of things we'll need."  
律子盯着她看了几秒钟，然后叹了口气说："好吧。但可能要等几个小时才能准备好一切。碰巧今天有人发现了一家五金店，回来时带了一些东西以防万一。我会再派几个人回去拿我们需要的东西清单。"

"Ritsuko?" "律子？"

"I'll be coming as well. I trust you, but I'd planned on seeing Unit 02 myself, so I think this kills two birds with one stone."  
"我也会一起去。我相信你，但我原本就打算亲自去看 Unit 02，这样一举两得。"

"But what about affairs here? What about the people returning?"  
"但这里的事务怎么办？那些回来的人呢？"

"I'm not the only doctor that Nerv employed. They should be able to handle things even if I'm away for a few hours."  
"Nerv 雇佣的医生不止我一个。即使我离开几个小时，他们应该也能应付得来。"

"Ritsuko, I-" "律子，我——"

"Get some rest if you can in the mean time. You look like you need it."  
"趁现在能休息就休息一下吧。你看起来很需要。"

Leaving her with that thought, Ritsuko left Misato alone in front of the tent after she went back in. Though she was anxious, Misato knew that sleep would be best right now. There was no point worrying over something which may or may not occur, but on the off chance that it did...  
留下这句话后，律子回到帐篷里，留下美里独自站在帐篷前。尽管心中焦虑，美里明白此刻睡眠是最好的选择。为可能发生也可能不发生的事情担忧毫无意义，但万一真的发生了……

Pushing that thought away from her mind, Misato found a small tent tucked away in a corner of the encampment, laid herself down on an empty sleeping back, and fell into a restless sleep.  
将那个念头从脑海中赶走，美里在营地的一角找到了一个小帐篷，躺在一个空睡袋上，陷入了不安的睡眠。

It felt like she had only just laid down, when Kaji shook her awake two hours later.  
感觉她才刚躺下，两个小时后，加持就摇醒了她。

"You look horrible," said Kaji after Misato sat up, yawning widely. In truth, she had only managed to get about half an hour of sleep, and ended up lying awake, tossing and turning for most of the time.  
“你看起来糟透了，”美里坐起身，打着大大的哈欠，加持说道。实际上，她只睡了大约半小时，大部分时间都在辗转反侧，无法入眠。

"Is Ritsuko ready?" "律子准备好了吗？"

"Yeah, she had me come and get you, and also told you to put something warm on. It's likely gonna be a cold night."  
"嗯，她让我来接你，还让你穿暖和点。今晚可能会很冷。"

Handing her a jacket and some warmer clothes, Kaji stepped out of the tent and waited for her to change, smoking while he waited. When Misato stepped out, she glanced over at him, before taking the cigarette out of his mouth and took a long drag on it.  
递给她一件夹克和一些更暖和的衣服，加持走出帐篷，等她换衣服，一边等一边抽烟。当美里走出来时，她瞥了他一眼，然后从他嘴里拿过香烟，深深吸了一口。

"I thought you quit," said Kaji, surprised by this action.  
"我以为你戒了，"加治对此举动感到惊讶。

"I needed that right now. My nerves are shot."  
"我现在正需要这个。我的神经都快崩溃了。"

Handing it back to him, Misato spotted Ritsuko walking towards then, dressed similarly as she was.  
把烟递还给他，美里注意到律子正朝他们走来，穿着和她相似的衣服。

"You awake?" "你醒了吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Then let's go. I want to at least get there before the sun completely sets."  
"那我们走吧。至少要在太阳完全落山前赶到那里。"

Ritsuko drove, with Misato riding shotgun beside her in the same jeep she had driven earlier. Kaji stayed behind at the camp, taking care of a few things on his end, deciding to leave it to them. Behind Ritsuko and Misato, five more vehicles drove at a distance behind them, each of varying makes, models, and colors. Ten more people were accompanying them, each an engineer who had hands on experience working with the Evangelions.  
律子开车，美里坐在副驾驶座上，同她一起坐在之前开过的吉普车里。加持留在营地处理一些事情，决定让他们先行。在律子和美里身后，五辆各式各样、颜色不同的车辆保持着一定距离跟随。另外十个人陪同他们，每个人都是有着实际操作经验的福音战士工程师。

By the time they reached there destination, it was already dark out, and they parked the six vehicles around the entry plug, the headlights shinning on it to provide light. The ten workers got out of their vehicles and started pulling out tools from crowbars, to buzz saws and blow torches.  
当他们到达目的地时，天色已晚，他们将六辆车围绕着插入栓停放，车头灯照亮了它以提供光线。十名工人从车上下来，开始从撬棍到电锯和喷灯等各种工具中取出所需物品。

Misato watched then start working around the entry plug, but noticed that Ritsuko had wandered over to the wreckage of Unit 02 and was examining it using a flash light she had brought. Hurrying over to her, she saw that Ritsuko was closely examining the skull.  
美里看着他们开始在插入栓周围工作，但注意到律子已经走到 02 号机残骸旁，正用带来的手电筒检查它。她急忙走过去，看到律子正在仔细检查那个头骨。

"Well, you were certainly right in that this is unsalvageable, but I'm glad I saw it myself."  
“好吧，你确实说得对，这东西无法修复，但我很高兴亲眼见到了。”

Misato saw that Ritsuko expression was darkened however, and the beam of her flashlight was closely inspecting the two gaping holes where the eyes had once been.  
美里注意到律子脸上的表情变得阴沉，她的手电筒光束正仔细检查着那两个曾经是眼睛的大洞。

"Misato, unless I'm very mistaken, I think the damage to Unit 02 was done after it was already incapacitated."  
“美里，除非我大错特错，我认为零二号机的损伤是在它已经失去行动能力后造成的。”

Misato's expression froze, but she managed she give a low reply.  
美里的表情凝固了，但她还是勉强给出了一个低沉的回应。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"These two points here, I think they were done by a Lance of Longinus."  
"这两处痕迹，我想是被朗基努斯之枪所造成的。"

The Lance of Longinus, capable of breaking through an Angels AT-field and destroying its core instantly. However, if said thing was used against an Evangelion, it would effectively disrupt the pilots synchronization, possibly killing the pilot, and where the two holes were.  
朗基努斯之枪，能够突破使徒的 AT 力场并瞬间摧毁其核心。然而，如果这东西被用来对付福音战士，它将有效地破坏驾驶员的同步率，可能导致驾驶员死亡，正如这两处孔洞所显示的。

"...No...Asuka," spoke Misato in horror.  
"...不...明日香，" 美里惊恐地说道。

"The cranial nerves were severed, originating from the back of the skull. It was thrust in from here."  
"颅神经被切断，起源于颅骨后部。它是从这里刺入的。"

"...Ritsuko..." "...律子..."

"I don't think there can be any denying it..."  
"我想这已经是不容否认的事实了..."

Then Asuka was- 然后明日香她——

"But," said Ritsuko cutting off Misato's voiceless cry, "keep in mind that both yourself and Kaji died, yet here you are standing next to me."  
“但是，”律子打断了美里无声的呼喊，“记住，你和加持都死了，可你现在却站在我身边。”

"Ritsuko, what are you saying?" said Misato, holding back her tears.  
“律子，你在说什么？”美里强忍着泪水说道。

"Only this. You died, yet here you are. There is something, some sort of phenomenon that happened here that I can't explain. Third Impact has apparently occurred, so why are we alive then? Even if Asuka did die, there is a strong possibility that she could come back just as you and Kaji did, and you aren't the only ones. Plenty other of our personnel died, only to return."  
“仅此而已。你死了，却又在这里。有些现象，某种我无法解释的事情发生了。第三次冲击显然已经发生，那我们为何还活着？即使明日香确实死了，她也有很大可能像你和加持那样复活，而你们并非个例。我们许多人员都曾死去，却又归来。”

"So, something like...God made this happen?"  
“所以，是类似……神让这一切发生的吗？”

"Something more physical than that I think, or a being that could be considered a god. Don't forget Misato, Shinji is not only human, but has Adam's DNA in him. I think he had some hand in whatever happened...this miracle if you will. I've also noticed that neither the Mass-Produced Eva's, or Unit 01 is here, though what's happened to them, I don't know. Either way, don't give up hope on Shinji or Asuka. Somehow or another, they'll turn up eventfully, I believe."  
“我想是某种更具体的存在，或者可以被视为神的存在。别忘了，美里，真嗣不仅是人类，他体内还有亚当的 DNA。我认为他在所发生的事情中起了某种作用……这奇迹，如果你愿意这么称呼的话。我还注意到，量产型 EVA 和初号机都不在这里，尽管它们发生了什么，我不得而知。无论如何，不要对真嗣或明日香失去希望。我相信，他们终将出现，无论以何种方式。”

At that moment, they heard a loud call from where the crew was working. They had managed to cut open the entry plug, though it had predictably been empty. Misato saw it for herself, but the only thing left was a small amount of LCL fluid which trickled out of the cut they had made. No sign of Asuka, or any possibility that she was ever even here.  
就在那一刻，他们听到从工作人员所在的地方传来一声响亮的呼喊。他们设法切开了插入栓，尽管里面空无一物是预料之中的事。美里亲眼所见，但唯一剩下的只有从切口处缓缓流出的少量 LCL 液体。没有明日香的踪迹，也没有任何她曾在此的迹象。

Without any other options, the group went back to the campsite, but Ritsuko was thinking about Shinji, and his possible relevance to Third Impact. There was still much that she didn't know, but also some that she hadn't told Misato. Shinji having Adam's DNA was essentially the catalyst that could have triggered Third Impact, but something else was required of course. Was it Shinji himself which had caused everybody to return, or was it that other being?  
别无选择，一行人返回营地，但律子却在思考真嗣，以及他可能与第三次冲击的关联。她仍有许多未知，也有一些未曾告诉美里。真嗣拥有亚当的 DNA，这本质上是触发第三次冲击的催化剂，但当然还需要其他条件。是真嗣本人导致了大家的回归，还是那个其他存在呢？

Ritsuko looked up to the darkened sky, wondering how far away from the truth she was.  
律子抬头望向昏暗的天空，思索着自己离真相还有多远。

---

The days passed by slowly, as Misato started getting used to being called the commander. Ritsuko and Kaji helped out her where there assistance was needed, but ultimately, the decision fell on her.  
日子一天天缓慢流逝，美里开始习惯了被称为指挥官。律子和加持在需要时伸出援手，但最终决策还是落在她身上。

The third day after they had opened Unit 02's entry plug, Misato received a report on the status of the Geofront and Dogma. Besides the destruction that Unit 01 and Shinji had caused while destroying military installation and the top part of the pyramid being blown off, the rest of the Geofront was largely in tact. Rations had been found within Nerv capable of supplying them for many months, but this was of course only on the assumption that everything was strictly for Nerv personnel. As there numbers continued growing, and civilians eventually started appearing, rations would start to dwindle. With this in mind, Misato decided to start planning for the inevitable future.  
在打开零二号机的插入栓后的第三天，美里收到了关于地底都市和死海文书的报告。除了零一号机和真嗣在摧毁军事设施和金字塔顶部时造成的破坏外，地底都市的其他部分基本完好。在 NERV 内部找到了足够供应他们数月的补给，但这当然仅限于严格为 NERV 人员提供。随着人数不断增加，平民最终开始出现，补给将开始减少。考虑到这一点，美里决定开始为不可避免的未来做计划。

The hills above Tokyo-3 had there fair share of small towns and homes, but the majority of it was farmland. Tokyo-3 had been built with the imagined possibility of it being the only remaining city on earth incase the Angels targeted the rest of the earth. Because of this, Tokyo-3 was supplied entirely by its own agricultural surroundings, eliminating the need for foreign imports.  
东京-3 上方的山丘上散布着许多小镇和住宅，但大部分地区仍是农田。东京-3 的建设考虑到了可能成为地球上唯一幸存城市的情景，以防使徒袭击其他地区。因此，东京-3 完全依靠周边农业自给自足，无需外部进口。

Misato sent out a team of people to the hills to inspect the land, fearing that they may have to start planting from scratch, but was surprised by the news she received when they returned. Though much of the fields were overgrown with weeds and nature had claimed back much of the civilized land, most of the fields were teeming with food still. With the change of seasons, fruit would fall from the stems and the seeds would become buried in the ground as animals trod upon them and water fell. Certain root based vegetables would need to be replanted, but they had returned at a time where the winter was just ending, and spring starting. Misato once again wondered if whatever force has brought them back had planned this all along. It certainly made things easier for her.  
美里派出一支队伍前往山丘勘察土地，担心可能需要从头开始种植，但当他们回来时，她收到的消息却出乎意料。尽管许多田地被杂草覆盖，自然重新夺回了大部分文明土地，但大多数田地依然生机勃勃，充满了食物。随着季节变换，果实会从茎上落下，种子被动物踩踏和水流掩埋。某些根茎类蔬菜需要重新种植，但他们回来的时机恰逢冬季结束，春天开始。美里再次怀疑，将他们带回的力量是否早已预谋这一切。这无疑让她的工作轻松了许多。

Finally, nearly a week after they had inspected Unit 02, Misato was greeted by the woman from the maintenance crew who has sped into the camp driving a red truck. The news couldn't have been any better: the backup generators were finally working. Misato couldn't help but smile at this news, and the people near her that heard this news began cheering. Electricity and running water: everybody had missed these daily necessities for the short time they had been without them.  
终于，在检查零二号机近一周后，Misato 迎来了那位驾驶红色卡车疾驰而来的维修队女性。消息再好不过了：备用发电机终于运转了。Misato 听到这消息不禁露出微笑，周围听到这消息的人们也开始欢呼。电力和自来水：大家短暂失去这些日常必需品后，都倍感怀念。

With the thought in mind that she should organize groups to go to the Geofront to relax for a while, Misato entered Ritsuko's tent. She was examining a large notebook that had notes about every patient that she had examined. At the very front of the notebook were numerous numbers, all of which had been crossed out and then finally at the very bottom was the number five hundred and seventy-eight, circled in red ink.  
想着应该组织队伍去地底都市放松一下，Misato 走进了 Ritsuko 的帐篷。她正在检查一本大笔记本，上面记录了她检查过的每一位病人的笔记。笔记本最前面有许多数字，都被划掉了，最后在底部是数字五百七十八，用红笔圈了起来。

"So this is what we're to as far as our population goes?" asked Misato.  
“这就是我们目前的人口状况吗？”Misato 问道。

"Yeah," said Ritsuko as she leaned back in her chair and stretched her arms up.  
"是啊，" 律子说着，靠在椅背上，伸了个懒腰。

"So have you heard?" "那你听说了吗？"

"I'm assuming by the cheering that the back up generators have been fixed?"  
"我猜是因为欢呼声，备用发电机已经修好了？"

"They have. I was thinking of sending groups of people down to the Geofront to relax and what not. God knows I could use a shower myself. With this amount of people though, I suppose we should start setting up residencies inside the Geofront."  
"他们确实需要。我在考虑分批让人下到地底都市去放松一下之类的。天知道我自己也需要洗个澡。不过这么多人，我想我们得开始在地底都市建立居住区了。"

"Either that our start rebuilding Tokyo-3's infrastructure."  
"要么就从重建第三新东京市的基础设施开始。"

"Isn't it a little soon for that?"  
"现在就开始重建，是不是有点太早了？"

"No, you're right. We still have a while before that begins. So what's next?"  
"不，你说得对。离那开始还有一段时间。接下来呢？"

"That was actually the main reason I came to see you. The electricity and water may be working again, but Nerv's network, the computer systems, are still down."  
"那其实是我来找你的主要原因。电力和水可能恢复了，但 NERV 的网络，计算机系统，仍然处于瘫痪状态。"

"I figured as much. I suppose they'll need my help in that regard."  
"我猜到了。我想他们在这方面需要我的帮助。"

"How soon can you get them back up?"  
"你多久能把它们重新启动？"

"If it's a simple matter of rebooting the system, about a day. Why though? They can't be of much help."  
"如果只是重启系统的话，大概一天。不过为什么呢？它们帮不上什么忙的。"

"I've actually been thinking Ritsuko, whether we our the only humans here."  
"我最近一直在想，律子，我们会不会是这里唯一的人类。"

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"You said when I first came back that currently it's only Nerv employees that our returning, so what about the other branches? What about our facilities in the United States and Germany?"  
"你刚回来时说过，目前只有 Nerv 的员工在返回，那么其他分支机构呢？我们在美国和德国的设施怎么办？"

"...I hadn't thought of that, but you raise a good point. It is possible, though I assumed since this is where Third Impact initiated from, that we would bear the brunt of humanities reappearance, though it is possible. Am I correct in assuming you want to contact them via the computers satellite uplink?"  
"...我之前没考虑到这一点，但你提得很有道理。虽然可能性存在，但我以为既然第三次冲击是从这里开始的，我们可能会首当其冲地面对人类的重新出现，不过确实有可能。我猜你是想通过电脑的卫星链接与他们联系？"

"That is my intention." "正是我的打算。"

"It could work, assuming that Nerv's satellites are still orbiting of course, but I'd be careful as well. Leaving the branch in Germany aside, the United States branch may no longer be under our control. Don't forget that before Tokyo-3 was attacked, each branch was suppressed, and while we know that Germany gave up without a fight and they were sympathetic to us, the United States may be different. I think they have long been in control by Seele."  
"这有可能奏效，当然前提是 Nerv 的卫星仍在轨道上运行，但我也会谨慎行事。暂且不论德国分部，美国分部可能已不再受我们控制。别忘了，在东京-3 被攻击之前，各分部都受到了压制，虽然我们知道德国分部未作抵抗且对我们抱有同情，但美国分部可能不同。我认为他们早已被 Seele 控制。"

At Ritsuko's words, Misato narrowed her eyes. "Ritsuko, do you think it possible that Seele could hinder us again?"  
听到律子的这番话，美里眯起了眼睛。"律子，你认为 Seele 有可能再次阻碍我们吗？"

"I don't know, but I can't rule it out. Seele is composed of the twelve most powerful men in the world, and though whatever they hoped to accomplish with Instrumentality is likely no longer possible, they may hold contempt for us. For now though, I don't think we have to worry about  
"我不确定，但不能排除这种可能性。Seele 由世界上最有权势的十二个人组成，尽管他们通过人类补完计划希望达成的目标可能已不再可能，但他们可能对我们抱有轻视。不过目前来看，我认为我们不必过于担心。"

them. It will take time for even them to rebuild the power they once had. Meanwhile, I suppose I should head to the Geofront and get started on the computer systems. What are you gonna do?"  
他们。即使对他们来说，重建曾经的力量也需要时间。与此同时，我想我应该前往地底都市，开始处理计算机系统。你打算做什么？

"I'll sort out a couple things here, then I plan on going somewhere I've been meaning to for a while."  
我先在这里处理几件事，然后计划去一个我一直想去的地方。

"Where's that?" 那是哪里？

"My old apartment." “我以前的公寓。”

After creating a rotating schedule of people visiting the Geofront, Misato drove to her old apartment. She asked Kaji whether he would join her, but he declined. Misato wasn't sure whether he was being considerate to her, since he likely knew why she was going there, but she had wanted him there all the same.  
在制定了一个轮流访问地底都市的计划后，美里驱车前往她以前的公寓。她问加持是否愿意同行，但他拒绝了。美里不确定他是否是在体贴她，因为他很可能知道她去那里的原因，但她还是希望他能陪她一起去。

As she drove into the spot she normally parked at, she glanced up to her apartment building. The right side of it was completely destroyed by what she guessed where shells fired from artillery, but her own room appeared unscathed.  
当她驶入平时停车的位置时，她抬头望向自己的公寓楼。楼的右侧被她猜测是炮弹击中而完全摧毁，但她的房间似乎完好无损。

Walking up the steps, each seemed heavier than the rest. When she approached her door, out of habit, she reached for her keys, but obviously didn't have them. As she began wondering whether she'd even be able to get in, she saw that the door was already open, but that parts of the door were damaged, riddled with bullet holes. It appeared that the soldiers had come her searching for both Shinji and Asuka at some point.  
走上台阶，每一步都显得比之前的沉重。当她走近自己的房门时，出于习惯，她伸手去摸钥匙，但显然没有带在身上。正当她开始怀疑自己是否还能进去时，她发现门已经开了，但门的部分已经损坏，布满了弹孔。看来士兵们曾在某个时候来这里搜寻过真嗣和明日香。

Pushing the door aside, she stepped into her old apartment and spoke to nobody-  
她推开门，走进了旧公寓，对着空无一人的房间说道——

"I'm back..." “我回来了……”

Her apartment was destroyed. The living room had been ran sacked, the couch was molding and had numerous bullet holes covering it, and the TV had been shattered. The window itself was also damaged, likely letting the rain in.  
她的公寓被毁了。客厅被洗劫一空，沙发发霉且布满弹孔，电视也已粉碎。窗户本身也受损，很可能让雨水渗了进来。

The kitchen was little better. The table had been kicked against a corner, and the three chairs were laying upside down, one of the chairs missing its legs. The refrigerator was left open and empty, an all the cabinets were swinging open, the pots and pans that Shinji had bought lay scattered on the floor.  
厨房情况稍好一些。桌子被踢到角落，三把椅子倒置，其中一把缺了腿。冰箱敞开着，空空如也，所有橱柜都半开着，真嗣买的锅碗瓢盆散落一地。

Her own bedroom had likewise been destroyed. Her bed was thrown against a wall, feathers from the mattress littering the carpet thanks to the bullet holes that riddle the mattress. Her dresser and had been turned over, her clothes scattered across the floor, and fragments of glass lay on the ground where he mirror had been shattered. The life that she had once had here was likewise gone.  
她自己的卧室同样被毁。床被扔到墙上，弹孔让床垫里的羽毛散落在地毯上。她的梳妆台翻倒，衣服散落一地，镜子碎片也散布在地上。她曾在这里拥有的生活也一并消失了。

Leaving her room, she entered the only one that had any stuff left in it, and dreaded the worst. Opening the door, she couldn't help but feel angry at the site she saw. Asuka's room had been ransacked in every way imaginable. Her bed was in tatters, the pillow and mattress torn apart by a stream of bullet holes. Posters that she had hung on the wall had been ripped down. Her  
离开她的房间，她走进了唯一还留有物品的那个房间，心中满是恐惧。推开门，她无法抑制地对眼前的景象感到愤怒。明日香的房间被洗劫一空，每一处都被破坏得面目全非。她的床支离破碎，枕头和床垫被一连串的弹孔撕裂。墙上她挂的海报也被撕扯下来。她的

wooden dresser had all the drawers ripped out of it, everything from shirts, pants, and underwear were strewn across the floor. The window that her bed rest under had been shattered, and the curtains had been torn and ripped apart. For some reason, Misato felt more angry here than even her own room. She hated to think of somebody going through this room, destroying everything that Asuka held dear.  
木制梳妆台的所有抽屉都被扯了出来，衬衫、裤子、内衣散落一地。她床下的窗户被砸碎，窗帘也被撕扯得破烂不堪。不知为何，美里在这里感到的愤怒甚至超过了她自己的房间。她痛恨想到有人闯入这个房间，毁掉明日香珍视的一切。

As she thought that however, something sprang to her mind. Quickly, she began searching the room, checking on, and under the bed, moving the dresser out of the way, and picking up every article of clothing. Finally, she found what she was looking for under a red shirt. They were no longer within the case, but the earrings that Shinji had given Asuka from the souvenir shop at the aquatic museum were still intact, the blue eyes of the two dolphins gleaming even in the dimness of the room. Misato couldn't help but smile as she examined them, remembering how embarrassed Asuka was when Ritsuko, Kaji, and herself had seen Shinji and Asuka out on what could have been considered a date. It felt like that had happened an eternity ago. She didn't know whether she would ever see Asuka again, but if she was allowed that privilege, she would give these to her.  
正当她这么想着，脑海中突然闪过一丝念头。她迅速开始在房间里搜寻，检查床底，挪开梳妆台，拾起每一件衣物。最终，她在一件红衬衫下找到了她要找的东西。它们已不在盒子里，但那对新治从水族馆纪念品店送给明日香的海豚耳环依然完好无损，即使在昏暗的房间里，两只海豚的蓝色眼睛依旧闪闪发光。美里不禁微笑着端详它们，回想起当时律子、加持和她自己看到新治和明日香外出，那或许可以算作一次约会时，明日香那窘迫的样子。感觉那仿佛是发生在很久以前的事了。她不知道自己是否还能再见到明日香，但如果能有这个荣幸，她会把这些耳环交给她。

Pocketing the earrings, she left Asuka's room and paused just as she was about to leave. Glancing over at Shinji's room, she hesitated, unsure whether she wanted to enter. So many things had led to him leaving, and so many memories existed within this space. Misato had been there guardian for a short time, but had watched then grow together. She wished for those moments, wanting to turn back the hands of time to happier moments when they had all lived together. But fate was a cruel thing.  
她把耳环收好，离开了明日香的房间，正要离开时停下了脚步。瞥了一眼真嗣的房间，她犹豫了，不确定是否要进去。太多的事情导致他离开，这个空间里留下了太多回忆。美里曾短暂地担任过他们的监护人，见证了他们的成长。她渴望那些时光，希望能让时间倒流，回到他们共同生活时的快乐时刻。但命运是残酷的。

She had made her decision though. Her old life was behind her, and there was no possible way of reclaiming it. Leaving behind everything she had ever accumulated in her life, she left her old apartment with nothing but the earrings.  
尽管如此，她已经做出了决定。她的旧生活已经过去，无法再挽回。她放弃了生活中积累的一切，只带着耳环离开了旧公寓。

---

Misato awoke early the next morning before the sun had even fully risen, and was currently speeding through the remnants of Tokyo-3. She had been awoken by an engineer who had been working on the cleanup of the Geofront, one of the many. The engineer had been contacted by Ritsuko using the newly reestablished communications within the Geofront, and that she wanted Misato to come to the command center as soon as possible. As such, Misato was hurriedly driving through Tokyo-3, making her way to one of the many gates that connected it to the Geofront.  
次日清晨，太阳尚未完全升起，美里便早早醒来，此刻正疾驰在东京-3 的废墟之中。她被一位参与地底都市清理工作的工程师唤醒，这样的工程师不在少数。这位工程师是通过地底都市内新近恢复的通讯系统接到律子联系的，律子希望美里尽快赶往指挥中心。因此，美里急匆匆地驾车穿越东京-3，前往连接地底都市的众多入口之一。

With nearly a thousand Nerv employees now available to work, they had begun cleaning up the devastation that had been left as a result of the attack. All the gates had been cleared of debris and rubble as well as the many military vehicles. Some of the these were still working, so those personnel experienced with such things had begun storing them on the off chance they could be used.  
随着近千名 NERV 员工投入工作，他们开始清理因袭击而留下的满目疮痍。所有入口的碎石瓦砾和众多军用车辆均已清除。其中一些车辆仍能运转，于是有经验的人员开始将它们妥善存放，以备不时之需。

Driving through one of the largest gates, Misato went deep underground before passing into the Geofront, parking her car in one of the many underground parking lots, and then used the stairs to ascend to the command level. Many of the elevators were still not working, but this was a matter of sabotage instead of lack electricity.  
驶过其中一座最大的大门，美里深入地下，穿过地底前线，将车停在了众多地下停车场之一，随后利用楼梯上升至指挥层。许多电梯仍未恢复正常，但这并非电力不足，而是破坏所致。

Each person she passed greeted her in a polite manner, and Misato was glad to see that Nerv was essentially functioning once again, even under these strenuous circumstances. Finally arriving at the commander center, Misato immediately spotted Ritsuko working at one of the three main Nerv computers, the Magi, developed by Ritsuko's mother.  
她经过的每个人都礼貌地向她打招呼，美里很高兴看到 NERV 基本上再次运转起来，尽管在这种紧张的情况下。最终抵达指挥中心，美里立刻发现了正在其中一台由律子母亲开发的 MAGI 主电脑前工作的律子。

"How's it coming?" asked Misato as she approached Ritsuko who was currently in a sitting position while her eyes were focused on a laptop in front of her.  
“进展如何？”美里走近正坐在椅子上，双眼紧盯着面前笔记本电脑的律子问道。

"Alright, all things considered. Coffee?" she then asked, pointing to pot casually plugged into an outlet against the wall. "I just finished brewing it."  
"好吧，综合考虑一下。来杯咖啡？" 她随即问道，随意地指着墙边插座上插着的咖啡壶。"我刚煮好的。"

"Thanks," said Misato, thinking it was exactly what she needed. She couldn't help but smell the stale smell of tobacco filling the air and noticed an ashtray not far from Ritsuko with several cigarettes crushed within it.  
"谢谢，" 美里说道，心想这正是她所需要的。她忍不住闻到了空气中弥漫的烟草陈腐气味，并注意到不远处律子旁边有一个烟灰缸，里面有几根被碾碎的香烟。

"Have you slept at all yet?" asked Misato after she had filled a cup.  
"你睡过觉了吗？" 美里倒满一杯咖啡后问道。

"For about two hours earlier, but taking a shower woke me up the most." replied Ritsuko.  
"大约两小时前，但洗个澡让我彻底清醒了。" 理津子回答道。

"I'll have to make it a point of doing that myself before I leave. So, what was it you wanted me here for? Did you manage to make contact with another branch?"  
"我得记住离开前也这么做。那么，你找我来有什么事？你联系上其他分部了吗？"

"No, but I haven't actually tried yet either. This is something else."  
"没有，但我其实还没尝试过。这是另一件事。"

Setting the laptop on the ground, Ritsuko walked around to one of the other Magi, and came back hefting a large stack of paper, and set them down in front of Misato.  
将笔记本电脑放在地上，Ritsuko 绕到另一台 Magi 前，回来时抱着一大堆纸张，放在 Misato 面前。

"What is all this?" asked Misato as she knelt down to get a closer look.  
“这都是些什么？”Misato 跪下凑近了些查看。

"Though the computer systems may have been off, they still catalog every date logged, no different then how a personnel computer accounts for the days passed after you haven't turned then on for a few days."  
“尽管计算机系统可能已关闭，它们仍然会记录每次登录的日期，就像个人电脑在你几天未开机后记录经过的天数一样。”

"Then what is all this paper for."  
"那这些纸是用来做什么的？"

"Unfortunately I haven't managed to get the graphical displays up yet, but the system just finished rebooting a few hours ago. I tested a print log to make sure they were functioning properly, and all but Casper is working properly. I suspect there may have been some corrosion in the copper wires, but will be easily replaced. After testing the print log however, I tried something else, and got what you see in front of you."  
"遗憾的是，我还没能让图形显示功能上线，但系统几个小时前刚刚完成重启。我打印了一份日志来确保它们正常工作，除了 Casper 之外，其他都运行良好。我怀疑铜线可能有些腐蚀，但更换起来很容易。不过，在测试打印日志之后，我尝试了其他东西，结果就是你现在看到的这些。"

"And what is this exactly?"  
"这究竟是什么东西？"

"Check the log on that first paper and you'll understand what I mean Misato."  
"查看那份文件的日志，Misato，你就会明白我的意思。"

Misato did so, looking at the first line. The writing was so small that she had to squint slightly to see it. At the top of the page was the date-  
Misato 照做了，目光落在第一行。字迹非常小，她不得不微微眯起眼睛才能看清。页面的顶部是日期——

"September 09, 2015," she spoke slowly, beginning to realized what she was seeing.  
"2015 年 9 月 9 日，"她缓缓念出，开始意识到自己所看到的内容。"

"The date that Nerv was attacked by the coalition of nations. I first ran this on Balthasar, and then Melchior, but I got the same results."  
那是 Nerv 遭到多国联盟攻击的日子。我先在巴尔萨扎上运行了这个程序，然后在梅尔基奥上运行，但得到了相同的结果。

Misato had stopped listening however, and had already begun frantically going through the large stack of papers. Every single line after the last logged date had only a single dash marking each subsequent day that passed. Eventually, Misato tore through the stack to reach the bottom quicker, and read aloud the next date logged.  
然而，美里已经不再听他说话，开始疯狂地翻阅那一大堆文件。自上次记录日期之后的每一行，都只有一个破折号标记着每一天的流逝。最终，美里撕开文件堆，以便更快地到达底部，并大声读出下一个记录的日期。

"March 02, 2022." 2022 年 3 月 2 日。

Misato stared long and hard at this date, hoping that the words displayed would suddenly shift to something that she could wrap her mind around, but Ritsuko spoke instead.  
美里长时间地盯着这个日期，希望这些字眼会突然转变为她能理解的东西，但律子却先开了口。

"I've been through the pages multiple times already, but there isn't a single date besides those two. The date there, would be today, the first time the computer systems were turned on in-"  
我已经翻阅了好几遍这些页面，但除了那两个日期外，没有其他任何一个日期。那上面的日期，就是今天，电脑系统首次启动的——

"Almost seven years," Misato spoke for her. Seven years? How was that possible? Even if it had been two years, Misato could have wrapped her mind around that as much as she wouldn't want to believe it...but seven...  
‘将近七年，’美里替她说道。七年？这怎么可能？即便是两年，美里也能勉强说服自己接受，尽管她并不愿意相信...但七年...

"Ritsuko," started Misato, trying to keep her voice from shaking, "is it possible that this is somehow wrong?"  
"律子，" 美里试图控制声音不颤抖，"有没有可能这是哪里出了错？"

"It's possible, but fairly remote. Without Casper online, I can't be one hundred percent sure, but my mother built the Magi to compliment yet clash with one another. Without all three, a general consensus can't be reached, but since both Balthasar and Melchior reached the same conclusion, I believe this date is true. It would explain what we've seen with regards to the environment."  
"有可能，但可能性相当小。没有卡斯帕在线，我无法百分之百确定，但我母亲设计的 MAGI 系统本就是为了互补又相互冲突。没有全部三台 MAGI，就无法达成普遍共识，但由于巴尔萨泽和梅尔基奥尔得出了相同的结论，我相信这个日期是真实的。这也能解释我们在环境方面观察到的现象。"

"But why? Almost seven years without humans on earth, why that long?"  
"但为什么？地球上近七年无人居住，为什么这么久？"

"I don't know, and I have to admit that it is hard to stomach this truth, but Misato, the real reason I wanted you to personally see this and couldn't trust anybody else is because we can't let people know about this, not a single person. It could quickly destroy everything that we've accomplished in this short time."  
"我不知道，我得承认这个真相难以接受，但美里，我之所以要你亲自来看这个，不能信任任何人，真正的原因是我们不能让任何人知道这件事，一个都不行。它可能会迅速摧毁我们在这短短时间内取得的一切成就。"

Misato wanted to say something in this regard, but knew that Ritsuko was right. They had to keep this in the dark for the time being, but it would eventually come to light. The evidence was after all, all around them, and many people had already wondered about this very thing.  
美里想就此说些什么，但知道律子是对的。他们暂时必须对此保密，但最终真相会大白。证据毕竟无处不在，已经有许多人对此产生了疑问。

"What about Kaji?" "那加怎么办？"

"You can tell him, he can handle this much without a problem."  
"你可以告诉他，他完全能应付这个，不会有问题的。"

"What about the other computer systems here at Nerv though? Plenty of personnel computers will show the same dates."  
"那 NERV 这里的其他电脑系统呢？很多人员电脑也会显示同样的日期。"

"Before I fully bring the systems back up, I'll write an algorithm to change all the systems to a more...feasible date, and I've already begun confiscating any laptops around the Geofront I find. I  
"在我完全恢复系统之前，我会编写一个算法，将所有系统日期改为一个更...合理的日期，并且我已经着手没收我在地底都市发现的任何笔记本电脑。我

know that it's only a matter of time before this gets out, but we can limit the fallout by rebuilding everything in the meantime. Of course, the possibility of the other branches finding out about this are very high, though that's of course if other humans exist on the planet besides here."  
知道这消息迟早会泄露，但我们可以通过在此期间重建一切来限制影响。当然，其他分支发现此事的可能性非常高，不过这前提是地球上除了这里还有其他人类存在。

"And how soon do you think we can try and contact the other branches, the one in Germany at the very least?"  
“你觉得我们多久能尝试联系其他分支，至少是德国的那个？”

"Once Casper is fixed, and the algorithm written, I can try contacting them via satellite communication. If I can identify the problem with Casper, then I'd estimate three or four days."  
“一旦卡斯帕修复完毕，算法编写完成，我就可以尝试通过卫星通信联系他们。如果我能找出卡斯帕的问题所在，那么我估计需要三到四天。”

"...well, I don't think I could ask for more from you right now. Thanks for letting me know, and try and get some sleep if you can; your eyes are bloodshot."  
"...嗯，我想我现在不能再向你要求更多了。谢谢你告诉我，如果可能的话，试着睡一会儿吧；你的眼睛都充血了。"

"And I think before you do anything else, you should take a shower, or a bath might be more relaxing," smirked Ritsuko.  
"而且我想在你做其他事情之前，你应该洗个澡，或者泡个澡可能会更放松，""律子笑着说。"

"Yeah, I should," said Misato with a sigh. "Keep me updated if you find anything."  
"是啊，我应该去洗个澡，""美里叹了口气说。""有什么发现记得告诉我。"

"Will do," said Ritsuko as she turned back to her laptop.  
“好的，”理津子说着，转身回到她的笔记本电脑前。

After finishing this conversation, Misato took the stairwell down to one of the lower levels where the residential areas were. These were largely for important personnel or diplomats.  
结束这段对话后，美里走下楼梯，来到一个较低的楼层，那里是住宅区。这些住宅区主要是为重要人员或外交官准备的。

As Ritsuko had suggested, Misato took a bath, forgetting what this sort of relaxation felt like. From the moment she had returned, it had been one thing or another and she was glad to have time to herself, time to think. Food was the biggest problem right now, and while the fields above Tokyo-3 had been a great discovery, was it truly sufficient to keep them alive for long? There were plenty of canned foods that could be found just scavenging the stores, but how long would that last, especially with people returning every day. Fish was something they could acquire in large quantities as far as meat went, but the Nerv personnel weren't cut out for that sort of work.  
正如理津子所建议的那样，美里洗了个澡，几乎忘记了这种放松的感觉。自从她回来后，事情一件接一件，她很高兴能有自己的时间，有时间思考。目前最大的问题是食物，尽管在第三新东京市上方的田地是一个伟大的发现，但它真的足够让他们长期生存吗？商店里可以找到大量的罐头食品，但随着人们每天返回，这些东西能维持多久呢？就肉类而言，他们可以大量获取鱼类，但 NERV 的人员并不适合做那种工作。

After spending nearly half an hour soaking in the bathtub, Misato stepped out and dried herself off, glad that there was a hair dryer available to her.  
在浴缸里泡了近半个小时后，美里走出浴缸，擦干身体，庆幸这里有吹风机可用。

Leaving Nerv didn't take long, and she was soon back at the camp, already getting reports as she drove to her own tent, which had been designated as the commanders tent.  
离开 NERV 没花多少时间，她很快就回到了营地，一边开车前往自己的帐篷——已被指定为指挥官帐篷——一边已经开始接收报告。

As she pulled up and parked near it, she spotted Kaji sitting on a chair just outside her tent, smoking a cigarette and reading a book.  
当她停好车走近时，看到加持正坐在她帐篷外的椅子上，抽着烟，读着一本书。

"Any good?" asked Misato as she stepped out of the jeep.  
“有什么好消息吗？”美里从吉普车里走出来问道。

"Not really, but it helps pass the time," sad Kaji as he set it down.  
“不算特别好，但至少能打发时间，”加持说着把东西放下。

"Come in, I have something to discuss with you," said Misato as she passed him and ducked into the tent.  
“进来，我有事要和你商量，”美里说着从他身边走过，弯腰进了帐篷。

Kaji followed, and just as he stepped into the tent, he said, "You took a shower I see."  
加治跟着走进帐篷，就在他踏入的那一刻说道：“看来你洗过澡了。”

"It was a bath actually, and how did you know?"  
“其实是泡了个澡，你怎么知道的？”

"I could smell the shampoo."  
“我能闻到洗发水的味道。”

Misato wasn't sure how to reply to that. She hadn't forgotten the relationship she had once had with Kaji, or the words spoken between them just before they had died, but now wasn't the time to dredge up past feelings.  
美里不确定该如何回应。她没有忘记曾经与加持的关系，也没有忘记他们临死前说的话，但现在不是挖掘过去感情的时候。

"I was with Ritsuko." “我和律子在一起。”

"So I heard. And? Did she manage to get the computers up and running?"  
“我听说了。然后呢？她设法让电脑重新运行了吗？”

Misato then launched into the discussion that she had had with Ritsuko, ending it with the reality of how much time had passed since they were last on the earth. Kaji didn't say anything, but he didn't look particularly shocked either.  
美里接着展开了她与律子之间的讨论，最后以自上次他们离开地球以来已经过去多少时间为现实收尾。加持没有说什么，但他看起来也并不特别震惊。

"You don't seem surprised."  
“你似乎并不惊讶。”

"I am, but I also somewhat expected this. It accounts for the changes that we've seen."  
“我是惊讶，但也多少预料到了。这解释了我们看到的那些变化。”

"Ritsuko said the same thing, but what I want to know is why? Why seven years? Why have we returned now?"  
"律子也说过同样的话，但我真正想知道的是为什么？为什么是七年？为什么我们现在回来了？"

"Who knows," shrugged Kaji. "And does it really matter even if seven years have passed? Sure, rebuilding everything is going to take time, likely several years altogether, but we're back, so there's no sense worrying about why, or how. The only thing we can do now is move forward."  
"谁知道呢，"加治耸了耸肩。"即便已经过去了七年，这真的重要吗？当然，重建一切需要时间，可能总共要几年，但我们回来了，所以没必要纠结为什么或怎么回来的。我们现在唯一能做的就是向前看。"

"Do you honestly believe that?"  
"你真的相信这些吗？"

"I do. Whether this was all planned or not doesn't matter to me all that much."  
"我确实如此。无论这一切是否都是计划好的，对我来说并不那么重要。"

"That may be your opinion, but I can't help but worry."  
"这可能是你的看法，但我忍不住担心。"

Silence engulfed then as Misato and Kaji sat beside each other. Slowly, Kaji glanced over at Misato and saw that she was bent over, looking at the ground. He wasn't sure where his feelings lay with regards to her right now, but felt that he should at least try and comfort her. Raising up his right hand, he rested it on top of her head, and gently leaned her body towards his.  
沉默笼罩着他们，美里和加持并肩而坐。渐渐地，加持瞥向美里，看到她弯着腰，盯着地面。他不确定自己现在对她的感觉如何，但觉得至少应该试着安慰她。他举起右手，轻轻地放在她的头上，温柔地将她的身体靠向自己。

"Right now, do what only you can do, and let other people shoulder the rest of the burden. You may be the person everybody is looking towards for help, but don't forget that you're not alone. You have both myself and Ritsuko to help you along this path."  
“现在，做只有你能做的事，让其他人分担剩下的负担。你可能成为众人求助的焦点，但别忘了你并不孤单。你还有我和律子在这条路上支持你。”

At that moment, footsteps approached the tent, and someone began calling for Misato. Straightening herself up hurriedly, Misato turned back towards Kaji and whispered a quick, "thank you," before she left the tent to attend to more important matters.  
就在这时，帐篷外传来了脚步声，有人开始呼唤美里。美里急忙挺直身子，转身向加持快速低语了一声“谢谢”，随后便离开帐篷去处理更紧急的事务。

Kaji continued sitting alone in the tent, waiting for his own moment to get up. Some people knew of his and Misato's prior relationship, but it was best to not start any rumors.  
加持继续独自坐在帐篷里，等待自己起身的那一刻。虽然有些人知道他和美里过去的关系，但最好不要引发任何流言蜚语。

"Even though I said that, I feel like Misato needs more than just myself and Ritsuko to help her," he mumbled.  
"尽管我这么说了，我觉得美里需要的不仅仅是自己和律子来帮助她，"他喃喃自语道。

Standing up, he left the tent and looked up to the blue sky.  
他站起身，离开了帐篷，抬头望向蔚蓝的天空。

"Hurry up and return you two," he said.  
"你们俩快点回来，"他说道。

Time passed slowly for the people who had returned, but they all soldiered on. Nerv employees continued returning, and soon their numbers had reached over one thousand. Truck loads of fruits began being shipped to both the Geofront and the camp, but the majority of it was kept at the Geofront for preservation purposes. Most people had begun creating residences in the Geofront, but a contingency was kept at the beach for the people that kept returning. Nearly a month after the first humans had reappeared on the beaches however, one day, nobody had returned. Patrols were expanded to cover more of the beach, driving up and down the beachfront, but nobody was found. At this point, Ritsuko deduced that they had reached the end of the Nerv personnel who would be returning. While the number was smaller than the dossier list of people that Nerv had employed, Ritsuko guessed that civilians would begin returning soon.  
时间对归来的人们来说流逝得异常缓慢，但他们都坚持不懈。NERV 的员工陆续返回，不久人数已超过一千。成卡车的水果开始运往地底都市和营地，但大部分为了保鲜目的存放在地底都市。多数人已在地底都市建立住所，但海滩上仍保留着为不断归来者准备的临时住处。然而，在第一批人类出现在海滩近一个月后的一天，再也没有人返回。巡逻范围扩大至更多海滩区域，车辆来回巡视，却一无所获。至此，律子推断他们已迎来 NERV 员工回归的尾声。尽管人数少于 NERV 雇佣人员档案清单，律子猜测平民不久也将开始返回。

The computers were up and running, and all the dates had been configured to show the date as late March in 2017, though it was really 2022. While they had managed to connect the Nerv computers to the satellites circling the earth that were affiliated with Nerv, they had not managed to get in touch with the facility in Germany. Despite this, Misato still tried to contact them once a day without fail. On the bright side, they had managed to find a couple radios capable of long distance communication via satellite. Misato and Ritsuko both had one with them at all times incase of emergencies, and the rest were split up between the Geofront and the campsite.  
电脑已经启动并运行，所有日期都已设置为显示 2017 年 3 月底，尽管实际上是 2022 年。虽然他们设法将 NERV 的电脑连接到了环绕地球的 NERV 卫星，但未能与德国的设施取得联系。尽管如此，美里仍然每天不遗余力地尝试联系他们。好在，他们找到了几台能够通过卫星进行远程通信的无线电。美里和律子每人随时都携带一台以防紧急情况，其余的则在 Geofront 和营地之间分配。

As March ended, and April began, the first civilians returned. Ritsuko had gotten a call from one of the patrols on the beach notifying her of this, and had immediately left the Geofront, getting in touch with Misato as she did do. Misato had been away on a trip north of Tokyo-3 where somebody had found a large farm of Japanese cows, most of which were old, but food was needed after all. Before Misato could make an adequate decision however, she was pulled back to the camp in a hurry.  
随着三月结束，四月开始，第一批平民返回了。律子接到海滩巡逻队的电话通知了这一情况，她立即离开 Geofront，并在途中联系了美里。美里当时正在东京-3 以北的地方，那里有人发现了一个大型日本牛农场，虽然大多数牛已经很老了，但毕竟食物是必需的。然而，在美里能做出充分决定之前，她被紧急召回营地。

Arriving at the camp nearly an hour after Ritsuko had informed her, she took the familiar path to Ritsuko tent, but paused as she heard unfamiliar voices coming from inside. She was fluent in both English and German as foreign languages, but she didn't understand what was being said, though she recognized it as Chinese.  
抵达营地时，距离律子通知她已近一个小时，她沿着熟悉的路线走向律子的帐篷，却在听到里面传来的陌生声音时停下了脚步。她精通英语和德语，但听不懂他们在说什么，尽管她能辨认出那是中文。

Quietly, she poked her head into the flap, and saw Ritsuko sitting beside a man who was laying on a bed, and another unfamiliar man sitting beside her. When Ritsuko noticed her presence, she said something to the guy beside her and stood up, greeting Misato, and the two of them stepped outside.  
她悄悄地探头进去，看到律子坐在一个躺在床上的男人旁边，还有另一个陌生男人坐在她旁边。当律子注意到她的存在时，对旁边的人说了些什么，然后站起来迎接美里，两人一起走了出去。

"What's going on?" asked Misato the moment they had stepped away. "Is that man laying down the civilian?"  
“怎么回事？”美里一走出帐篷就问道，“那个躺着的人是平民吗？”

"He is, though I didn't account for the possibility of a language barrier."  
“他确实是，尽管我未曾考虑到语言障碍的可能性。”

"Is he Chinese? I thought I recognized some of the words."  
"他是中国人吗？我好像听懂了一些词。"

"He is, and it's a good thing that we have a few employees who are Chinese, otherwise we might have had a problem. He was violent when the patrol first found him, and they nearly had to drag him back to the camp, but that's understandable."  
"是的，幸好我们有几位中国员工，不然可能会有麻烦。他刚被巡逻队发现时很暴力，差点得强行把他拖回营地，不过这可以理解。"

"How is he doing?" "他现在怎么样了？"

"Better now. Once somebody was found to translate, we managed to calm him down, and then I began explaining things to him."  
“现在好多了。找到人翻译后，我们设法让他平静下来，然后我开始向他解释情况。”

"What did you tell him?"  
“你告诉他什么了？”

"The truth, or part of it at least. Nuclear holocaust wouldn't suffice, so I only gave him enough information that would convince him. Basically the vaguest about Third Impact and Nerv's role as well as its affiliation with the United Nations, though I left out everything about the Evangelions and Angels. He was skeptical at first, but having a fellow countryman reassuring him helped."  
“真相，至少是一部分。核灾难的说法不够充分，所以我只给了他足够的信息来让他信服。基本上是最模糊的关于第三次冲击和 NERV 的角色及其与联合国的关系，不过我略去了关于 EVA 和使徒的一切。他起初有些怀疑，但有同胞的安慰确实有帮助。”

"So how do we go from here?"  
"那么，我们接下来该怎么办？"

"That's actually the good news. From talking with him, we've learned that he was part of a small fishing village off the coast of the South China Sea. He knows a lot about fishing, so I think we can guarantee a sizable income of fish if more like him return."  
"这其实是个好消息。通过和他交谈，我们了解到他来自南海沿岸的一个小渔村。他对捕鱼非常了解，所以我认为如果再有像他这样的人回来，我们能确保大量的鱼获收入。"

"Ritsuko that's-" "律子，这——"

"Exactly what we needed, I know. I'm almost positive now that something is, or has, prearranged all this for us. I think we can assume that the first civilians that will be returning are those who's skills are related to agriculture or food production in some way. How were the cows?"  
"正是我们需要的，我知道。我现在几乎可以肯定，这一切都是被某种力量或某个存在为我们预先安排好的。我想我们可以假设，第一批返回的平民将是那些技能与农业或食品生产相关的人。那些牛怎么样了？"

"I don't think they're something to eat. A couple corpses were found in the field, and a lot of them looked sickly, though I'm no farmer, so I'm not sure."  
"我觉得它们不是用来吃的。田里发现了几具尸体，其中很多看起来病怏怏的，不过我不是农民，所以不太确定。"

"At least we'll have fish," sighed Ritsuko.  
"至少我们还有鱼。" 律子叹息道。

"Once more farmers return, we can start worrying about rice and fruit production, though rice should be first. Any luck with the other Nerv facilities?"  
"一旦农民们再次归来，我们就可以开始担心稻米和水果的生产了，不过稻米应该是首要任务。其他 NERV 设施那边有什么进展吗？"

"No, and I'm starting to think that it won't be possible."  
"没有，我开始觉得这可能行不通了。"

"If there is some other force at work here though, surely they would have accounted for an overcrowding problem here and food shortages if we get to many people."  
"但如果这里还有其他力量在运作，他们肯定已经考虑到了人口过多和食物短缺的问题，如果我们聚集了太多人的话。"

"...You have a point. Suppose I'll keep trying. In the meantime, we just have to wait for more people that can assist with food production to return."  
"...你说得有道理。我想我会继续尝试。与此同时，我们只能等待更多能协助食物生产的人回来。"

"That's all we can do," said Misato, but she was wondering something else. If the Nerv employees had stopped returning, and civilians would now begin reappearing, then where were Shinji, Asuka, and Rei?"  
"我们只能这么做，""美里说道，但她心里却在想别的事情。如果 NERV 的员工已经停止返回，而平民现在开始重新出现，那么真嗣、明日香和丽又在哪里呢？"

---

The civilians began returning slowly in twos and threes, but soon, nearly ten would arrive in the beach every day.. Due to the possibility of language barriers, Misato had decided that the patrols would now consist of people that were fluent in multiple languages. As the civilians continued returning though, it became apparent that nearly all the civilians were from Asian backgrounds. With this in mind, Ritsuko began guessing that Tokyo-3 would manage the civilians from Asia, the German branch would be in charge of Europe and the Middle East, and that the United States branch would be in charge of North and South America.  
平民们开始缓慢地以两三人为一组返回，但很快，每天几乎有十人会到达海滩。由于语言障碍的可能性，美里决定巡逻队现在将由精通多种语言的人组成。尽管平民们继续返回，但很快就明显看出，几乎所有平民都来自亚洲背景。考虑到这一点，律子开始猜测，东京-3 将管理来自亚洲的平民，德国分部将负责欧洲和中东，而美国分部将负责北美和南美。

Finally, around mid April, a month and a half since humans had returned, Ritsuko managed to get a secure satellite communication with the Germany branch situated in Berlin. Calling Misato to the Geofront immediately, she arrived at the commander center late in the evening after receiving a report about the first fishing haul.  
终于，在四月中旬，人类回归一个半月后，律子设法与位于柏林的德国分部建立了安全的卫星通讯。她立即通知美里前往地底都市，美里在收到关于首次捕鱼收获的报告后，于傍晚时分抵达指挥中心。

Stepping out of the elevator doors which had recently been fixed, she walked over to Ritsuko who was waiting in front of a computer. They only had voice communications operable for now, but even this was a massive improvement.  
走出刚刚修复的电梯门，她走向正在电脑前等候的律子。目前他们只能进行语音通讯，但即便如此，这也是一个巨大的进步。

"Have you talked to them at all yet?" asked Misato as she approached Ritsuko.  
“你已经和他们联系过了吗？”美里走近律子时问道。

"Just brief greetings. The mans name is Alexander, though Alex is fine he said, and he's in charge of the research center in our German branch."  
"只是简短的问候。那位先生的名字是亚历山大，不过他说亚历克斯也可以，他是我们在德国分部的研究中心负责人。"

"When was the call received?"  
"电话是什么时候接到的？"

"About thirty minutes ago. Nobody else knows about this."  
"大约三十分钟前。其他人都还不知道这件事。"

"Good. I'll take it from here."  
"很好，接下来交给我吧。"

Taking the seat that Ritsuko had just vacated, Misato flipped a switch on the control panel, turning the communications on.  
坐在刚刚律子离开的座位上，美里按下了控制面板上的一个开关，开启了通讯设备。

"This is Major Misato Katsuragi currently in charge here in Tokyo-3. Can you hear me Alex?" spoke Misato into the microphone.  
""这里是负责东京-3 防务的葛城美里少校。亚历克斯，你能听到我吗？"" 美里对着麦克风说道。

"Loud an clear," came the return voice. Judging by his voice, Misato would place his age anywhere between thirty-five and fifty, but she wasn't about to ask. She had more important things to discuss.  
"清晰响亮。" 对方的声音传来。从他的声音判断，美里估计他的年龄在三十五到五十岁之间，但她不打算问。她有更重要的事情要讨论。

"Can you give me a status report on the situation over there."  
"你能给我汇报一下那边的情况吗？"

"Yeah, I'm just glad we've managed to get in touch with other humans." Clearing his voice, Alex continued. "It's been twenty-one days now since the first humans, Nerv employees I should say, started returning. The city is mostly intact, but, the water levels of the river Spree which runs  
"是的，我很高兴我们终于能和其他人类联系上了。" 亚历克斯清了清嗓子，继续说道。"从第一批人类，也就是 Nerv 员工开始返回算起，已经过去二十一天了。城市大部分完好无损，但是，流经此地的施普雷河的水位已经

through Berlin have risen, so certain sections of the city have flooded, but this is also where people started returning from. Currently we have a little more than five hundred people here, and most of our efforts were initially devoted to securing food and other supplies. Afterwards, we began wondering about the possibilities of other humans, particularly in Tokyo-3 living and decided to try contacting you. Owing to the coalition of nations attack against us however, and our surrender, both our computers and power generators were taken off line, and we've only just managed to get both online within the past three days.  
柏林的水位已经上升，因此城市的某些区域被淹没了，但这也是人们开始返回的地方。目前我们这里有五百多人，最初我们大部分精力都用于确保食物和其他物资。之后，我们开始考虑其他人类的可能性，特别是在东京-3 的生活，并决定尝试联系你们。然而，由于各国联盟对我们的攻击以及我们的投降，我们的电脑和发电机都被关闭了，直到最近三天才刚刚恢复在线。

"Do you have stable food production?"  
“你们有稳定的食物生产吗？”

"As it stand, we're currently rationing things, but if civilians start returning, we're not sure how we'll fair."  
“目前我们正在实行配给制，但如果平民开始返回，我们不确定会怎么样。”

"We've already got civilians on our end returning, but all of them so far have been fisherman."  
"我们这边已经有平民返回，但目前为止都是渔民。"

"What we need is people with agriculture experience more than anything. Most of our people are engineers. But what are things like on your end? What happened to Gendo Ikari? Why isn't he in charge? I've heard of you Major Katsuragi, and Dr. Akagi, and I can assume that you know the most about what happened in Tokyo-3."  
"我们最需要的是有农业经验的人。我们大多数人都是工程师。但你们那边情况如何？碇源堂怎么了？他为什么不是负责人？我听说过你，葛城美里少校，还有赤木律子博士，我猜你们最了解第三新东京市发生了什么。"

"How much do you know?"  
"你知道多少？"

"If you mean about Third Impact the Evangelions, and the Angels, then I suppose I know the same as you did. I wasn't part of the team that initially developed the Evangelions, but I was part of the team that helped with Unit 02's development. What happened at Tokyo-3 though when it was attacked?"  
"如果你指的是第三次冲击、EVA 和使徒，那我想我知道的和你差不多。我并非最初开发 EVA 团队的成员，但我参与了二号机的研发工作。不过，东京-3 遭受攻击时发生了什么？"

Misato paused and glanced over at Ritsuko. She just shrugged however; there didn't seem to be any problem telling him the entire story, so Misato recounted everything she could remember, and what she had been told about the attack on Tokyo-3.  
美里顿了顿，瞥了一眼律子。律子只是耸了耸肩；似乎告诉他整个故事并无不妥，于是美里尽可能回忆并讲述了关于东京-3 被攻击的一切她能记得的和她所被告知的内容。

When she was finished, Alex was silent on the other end for a moment before he confirmed something.  
她讲完后，亚历克斯在电话那头沉默了一会儿，然后确认了一些事情。

"And this is After Impact then?"  
"那么这就是‘后冲击’之后的情况了？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"But you have no idea why humans have returned?"  
"但你并不知道人类为何会重返？"

"We think there is something at work which we don't understand which has either planned all this out, or is moving things as we speak, but we don't know why we have returned or how."  
"我们认为有一种我们尚未理解的力量在起作用，它可能早已策划了这一切，或者正在我们说话间推动事态发展，但我们不知道我们为何回归，也不知道是如何回归的。"

"...And I assume that you have realized what the date is?" asked Alex quietly.  
"...而我想你已经意识到今天是什么日子了？" Alex 轻声问道。

"...We have," said Misato, "but currently only three people including myself know of this."  
"...我们确实知道，" Misato 说，"但目前只有包括我在内的三个人知道这件事。"

"It looks like I was right in keeping that to myself," mumbled Alex. "So what are your plans currently?"  
"看来我保密是对的，" Alex 喃喃自语，"那么你们目前有什么计划？"

"Food production is still the most important, but once we have that at sustainable levels, we plan on restoring Tokyo-3's infrastructure."  
"粮食生产仍然是最重要的，但一旦我们达到了可持续的水平，我们计划重建第三新东京市的基础设施。"

"We have similar goals, though food is the most pressing concern."  
"我们的目标相似，尽管食物是最紧迫的问题。"

"I think once the civilians return, you won't have to worry about that. From what we've seen, whatever force brought us back, is also assisting us."  
"我认为一旦平民们返回，你就不必担心这个问题了。从我们所见的情况来看，无论是什么力量让我们回来，它也在帮助我们。"

"I hope that's true," said Alex.  
"我希望那是真的," 亚历克斯说。

They continued talking with each other for nearly an hour. Discussing the possibility of joint operations, or simple visits, but they each had their own problems to worry about currently. Eventually, they settled on discussing changes once a week and left it at that, but Misato had one last thing to add.  
他们继续交谈了将近一个小时。讨论联合行动或简单访问的可能性，但他们各自目前都有自己的问题需要担心。最终，他们决定每周讨论一次变化，并就此达成一致，但美里还有最后一件事要说。

"Have you heard anything from the United States facility in Massachusetts?"  
"你有没有听到马萨诸塞州美国设施的任何消息？"

"No, and I was going to ask you the same actually, but I take that to mean you haven't either?"  
"没有，我正想问你同样的问题，但我想这意味着你也没有？"

"No, and if by chance they do try and contact you, do not answer under any circumstances. We have reason to believe that they may have leaked information about us to the coalition of nations. If Berlin is back, then it's enough to assume that the site in Massachusetts is as well."  
"没有，如果他们碰巧试图联系你，无论如何都不要回应。我们有理由相信他们可能已经向国家联盟泄露了关于我们的信息。如果柏林回来了，那么可以假设马萨诸塞州的站点也是如此。"

"Very well, I'll keep that in mind."  
"很好，我会记住的。"

Saying their goodbyes, both Misato and Alex returned to their duties, but Misato quickly turned to Ritsuko and asked, "So, what do you think?"  
告别完毕，Misato 和 Alex 各自返回岗位，但 Misato 很快转向 Ritsuko 问道：“那么，你怎么看？”

"I was gonna ask you the same thing, but it seems like we can trust him."  
“我本来也想问你同样的问题，但看来我们可以信任他。”

"I was thinking the same thing, but it's probably best to keep a couple things to ourselves." Misato had deliberately left out anything referring to Shinji's abilities during the battle since this was still a subject that not many people knew about.  
“我也是这么想的，但最好还是保留一些事情不对外说。”Misato 故意没有提及战斗中 Shinji 的能力，因为这个话题目前仍鲜为人知。

"Well, I'll check back in with Alex in a week. How much of the Geofront has been rebuilt?"  
"嗯，我一周后再跟亚历克斯联系。第三新东京市地下区域的重建进度如何？"

"Dogma is mostly repaired, though we haven't checked the very lowest levels yet, so we can't be sure. Other that, the Geofront needs some repairs to its foundation due to Unit 01 tearing up the soil, and of course the hole from the N2 bomb needs repairing, but that will take several months. With more civilians returning everyday, we may be able to speed up things if they are engineers or construction workers."  
"多哥玛基地基本修复完毕，不过我们还没检查到最底层，所以不能完全确定。除此之外，由于零号机破坏了地基，地下区域需要一些修复工作，当然还有 N2 炸弹造成的那个大洞也需要修补，但这可能需要几个月的时间。随着越来越多的平民返回，如果有工程师或建筑工人，我们或许能加快进度。"

"Things are progressing smoothly so far."  
"目前进展还算顺利。"

"If the United States facility is up and running however, we need to be careful. Seele could be taking action soon."  
"但如果美国的设施已经启动，我们就得小心了。Seele 可能很快就会采取行动。"

"What can they do from across the ocean though?"  
"他们隔着大洋能做什么呢？"

"Launch fighters with tactical nukes for starters."  
"首先，可以发射携带战术核弹的战斗机。"

"Are you suggesting we start preparing defenses for ourselves?"  
"你是建议我们开始为自己准备防御措施吗？"

"It's only a thought, but I don't think they'll go that far to destroy us."  
"这只是个想法，但我认为他们不会走那么远来摧毁我们。"

"I'll have to consider it I suppose," sighed Misato, adding it to her list of things to keep in mind. They knew they weren't the only humans on earth anymore, but humanity still had a long ways to go before it returned to its glory days.  
"我想我得考虑一下，"米萨托叹了口气，把它加到了她需要记住的事情清单上。他们知道地球上不再只有人类，但人类要回到昔日的辉煌，还有很长的路要走。

---

Five days later, on the 20th of April, Misato received an urgent communications from Ritsuko. She hasn't specified what it was, only that Misato's presence was required, and that not even Kaji could come. So, before the sun had even appeared on the horizon, Misato was stepping into the jeep she frequently drove, and sped her way to the Geofront.  
五天后，即 4 月 20 日，美里收到了律子发来的紧急通讯。她没有具体说明是什么事，只要求美里必须到场，甚至连加持都不能来。于是，在太阳尚未升起的地平线前，美里便踏上了她常开的那辆吉普车，疾驰向地底都市。

Misato could tell from Ritsuko's voice that something was wrong. She hadn't said what, but the waver in her voice was undeniable. Had the United States branch tried to contact them? Had Seele been involved somehow? Questions continued erupting in Misato's mind, right up until she stepped out of the elevator and into the command center.  
从律子的声音中，美里能感觉到出了问题。她虽未明说，但声音中的颤抖不容忽视。是美国分部试图联系他们了吗？还是 Seele 插手了？疑问在美里脑海中不断涌现，直到她走出电梯，步入指挥中心。

Ritsuko was standing beside one of the main consoles, her eyes roving over the screen, and she didn't even notice Misato until she stood beside her.  
律子正站在一台主控制台旁，目光在屏幕上扫视，直到美里站到她身边，她才注意到。

"What's wrong?" asked Misato. "Is it something to do with Seele?"  
"怎么了？" 美里问道。"是和 Seele 有关吗？"

"No, and I almost wish it was. Just under an hour ago, the Magi detected an anomaly which they identified as pattern blue."  
"不，我倒希望是。就在不到一小时前，MAGI 探测到了一个异常，它们识别为蓝色模式。"

Misato froze, thinking that she had misheard. "Ritsuko, the Angels are-"  
美里僵住了，以为自己听错了。"律子，使徒们——"

"Supposed to be gone, I know, but they may not be either. Tabris was supposed to be the last one, but the Magi are correct. It was only for a brief moment, but it's been confirmed."  
“本该消失了，我知道，但他们也可能还在。塔布里斯本该是最后一个，但贤者们是正确的。虽然只是短暂的一瞬，但已经得到了确认。”

"Where at?" asked Misato, trying to keep calm.  
“在哪里？”美里问道，努力保持冷静。

"North of Kyoto about ten miles."  
“京都以北大约十英里处。”

Misato didn't say anything, running this alarming information through her head. An Angel here? But why now of all times? It didn't make any sense. And why Kyoto and not Tokyo-3?  
美里没有说话，脑海中反复思考着这条令人震惊的消息。天使在这里？但为什么偏偏是现在？这毫无道理。而且为什么是京都而不是第三新东京市？

"Ritsuko, what are we gonna do about this?"  
“律子，我们该怎么办？”

"...I was actually hoping you had an answer, because I've no idea how to handle this. No Evangelions means we haven't the power to suppress it, and even if we did, there isn't any children which fit the criteria required to pilot one."  
“……我其实也希望你能有答案，因为我完全不知道如何应对。没有 EVA 意味着我们没有力量去压制它，即使有，也没有符合驾驶条件的孩子。”

"So what do we do?"  
"那我们该怎么办？"

Sighing, Ritsuko said, "The way I see it, we have two options. We can either ignore this, pretending that it never happened and hope for the best, or we can send a specialized team to investigate this."  
叹了口气，律子说：“依我看，我们有两个选择。要么我们对此视而不见，假装它从未发生过，并期待最好的结果，要么我们可以派遣一个专门的团队去调查这件事。”

"I don't like either option. Leaving the first aside, how would we explain going to Kyoto?"  
“这两个选项我都不喜欢。先不说第一个，我们去京都该怎么解释呢？”

"Make something up of course, if we go that route. If an Angel were to come here suddenly, it would spell the end of what we've accomplished. Wide spread panic, people killing each other, though of course we may all die."  
"当然得编个理由，如果我们走那条路的话。如果一个天使突然来到这里，那将是我们所成就的一切的终结。大规模的恐慌，人们互相残杀，虽然我们可能都会死。"

"So you're saying we have no other option but to investigate this?"  
"所以你是说我们别无选择，只能调查这件事？"

"Basically," replied Ritsuko with a small smile.  
"基本上是这样，" 赤木律子带着一丝微笑回答道。"

Misato didn't know how to deal with this situation, and for the first time, wished that they still had the Evangelions. It was impossible to fight an Angel without them after all. Even so, they needed to know more about this either way, especially if it posed a threat to them.  
美里不知道该如何应对这种情况，这是她第一次希望他们还拥有使徒。毕竟，没有使徒是不可能与天使战斗的。即便如此，他们无论如何都需要了解更多关于这个存在的信息，尤其是如果它对他们构成威胁的话。

"I'll need to assemble a team then, people that have had experience during the attack and that can follow orders to the letter. It'll need to be a small team, eight people at the most, and well outfitted."  
“那么，我需要组建一个团队，由那些在袭击中有经验并且能够严格遵守命令的人组成。团队必须小，最多八个人，并且装备精良。”

"Weapons?" “武器？”

"Precautionary at the most; the conventional weapons we possess won't even phase an Angel. Can you get me a list of the most experienced people that have returned?"  
"最多只是预防性的；我们拥有的常规武器对使徒根本不起作用。你能帮我列出那些最有经验的人员名单吗？"

"I'll get on it, but it sounds as though you plan on taking part in this as well."  
"我这就去办，但听起来你似乎也打算亲自参与这次行动。"

"I do. I'm not gonna bunker down here and wait to hear reports."  
"没错。我不会躲在这里坐等报告的。"

Ritsuko looked like she disapproved of this, but didn't say anything further on the subject, only nodding.  
律子看起来对此并不赞同，但没有进一步发表意见，只是点了点头。

---

The following day, Misato had ten people in her tent, the eight that she had selected based on the roster that Ritsuko had drawn up, and one other person who she rather hadn't known of this.  
第二天，美里在自己的帐篷里召集了十个人，其中八人是根据律子制定的名册挑选的，还有一个人是她之前并不知晓的。

The eight men were all in there thirties, with the leader of the group nearly forty. They were all dressed casually for now, but that would change as soon as they set out. Basic combat gear had been chosen that emphasized movement over protection. They were there to investigate after all and not fight a war.  
这八名男子年龄都在三十岁左右，小组的领导已近四十。他们目前穿着随意，但一旦出发，着装就会改变。选用的基本战斗装备侧重于机动性而非防护性。毕竟，他们的任务是调查而非作战。

Misato went over the operation, giving very minute details about everything. It was strictly on a need to know basis, so all of them were in the dark until they got close to there destination. While each was given a radio, they were only used for communicating with each other or her.  
美里详细地讲解了行动方案，每一个细节都交代得非常清楚。这是基于必要知晓的原则，所以他们直到接近目的地之前都一无所知。虽然每个人都配备了一台无线电，但它们仅用于彼此之间或与她进行通讯。

After giving her orders, she told them to go wait until she was done dealing with a few things and after they left, she rounded on the other person who had been waiting for her.  
下达完指令后，她让他们先去等待，直到她处理完一些事情。在他们离开后，她转向了另一个一直在等她的人。

"What are you doing here Kaji?" asked Misato clearly irritated.  
“你在这里做什么，加持？”美里明显带着不悦问道。

"What, no thanks for tagging along?"  
"怎么，不感谢我一路跟着吗？"

"Did Ritsuko put you up to this?"  
"是律子让你来的吗？"

"You guessed right, and I can't blame her for telling me. She was worried about you, as am I."  
"你猜对了，我不能怪她告诉我。她担心你，我也一样。"

"So no matter what I say, you plan on following me?"  
"所以无论我说什么，你都打算跟着我？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Whatever. If you're set, then let's get going."  
"随便你。如果你决定了，那我们就出发吧。"

Leaving the tent, they stepped into Misato's jeep and started it. Misato didn't bother with combat gear like the eight soldiers, and only had a sidearm which she had stashed in the glovebox. Kaji brought a sidearm with him as well, but neither believed that they'd be required to use it.  
离开帐篷，他们上了美里驾驶的吉普车并启动了引擎。美里没有像那八名士兵一样穿戴战斗装备，只带了一把藏在手套箱里的手枪。加持也带了一把枪，但两人都不认为会需要用到它。

Leaving the campsite, they drove into what remained of downtown Tokyo-3 to the spot they had agreed to meet with the soldiers. There would be three vehicles, two of which were Humvee's with light armor plating used by the opposing soldiers during the attack on Nerv. It could stop low caliber bullets, but anything else would rip through it like paper. They had been prepared in secret so as not to alarm the rest of the population or create unnecessary questions, so they were meeting them at this undisclosed location.  
离开营地后，他们驱车前往残存的第三新东京市中心，到达了与士兵们约定的会合地点。那里将有三辆车，其中两辆是配备轻型装甲板的悍马车，这些车在攻击 NERV 时被敌方士兵使用。它能抵挡低口径子弹，但其他任何东西都能像撕纸一样穿透它。他们秘密准备了这些车辆，以免引起其他民众的恐慌或产生不必要的疑问，因此选择在这个未公开的地点会面。

As Misato drove around the corner where she had specified the location however, she immediately stopped on the brake, bringing the jeep to a sudden stop. Something was clearly wrong, and Misato didn't need to tell this to Kaji.  
然而，当美里驾车绕过她指定的地点时，她立刻踩下刹车，让吉普车突然停了下来。显然出了问题，而美里无需向加持说明这一点。

Eight vehicles were all parked on the street, but there was clearly something missing. Getting out of the jeep, Misato and Kaji walked over to the vehicles and peered passed them, when Misato suddenly swore.  
八辆车都停在街上，但明显少了些什么。美里和加持下了吉普车，走到那些车旁，透过车隙望去，美里突然咒骂了一声。

"God damn it," she groaned.  
"该死," 她咕哝道。

The two Humvee's which should have been parked waiting to leave, and the eight soldiers were no where in sight.  
本应停在那儿等待出发的两辆悍马车，以及那八名士兵，却不见踪影。

"Fuck!" Misato shouted, her voice bellowing to the sky. Where the hell were they? Running back to the jeep, she grabbed the satellite radio out of the jeep and tried contacting.  
"操！" 美里大喊，声音响彻云霄。他们到底在哪儿？她跑回吉普车，抓起车上的卫星无线电试图联络。

"This is Misato! Where the fuck are you?" Unfortunately, all she got was static.  
“我是美里！你他妈到底在哪儿？”不幸的是，她只听到一片静电噪音。

Chucking the radio back into the jeep, she grabbed the gun out of her glovebox, and using the butt, smashed the windows in of the eight vehicles that were left there, hoping to find some evidence. All the casual clothes that the soldiers had been wearing earlier were discovered, but there was no note or anything for where they had gone.  
她把无线电扔回吉普车里，从手套箱里抓起枪，用枪托砸碎了剩下的八辆车的车窗，希望能找到一些线索。士兵们之前穿的便服都被发现了，但没有任何字条或线索表明他们去了哪里。

Grabbing the radio again, she call Ritsuko multiple times until she was nearly screaming before Ritsuko finally picked it up.  
她再次拿起无线电，多次呼叫律子，直到几乎要尖叫起来，律子才终于接听。

"Misato what-" "美里，什么——"

"My team is gone! Disappeared! They took the Humvee's and left!"  
"我的团队不见了！消失了！他们开走了悍马车，就这么走了！"

"Slow down Misato. Tell me what happened."  
"慢点说，美里。告诉我发生了什么。"

"Because of you pushing Kaji onto me, the eight soldiers disappeared with the Humvee's before I got here."  
“因为你把加持推给我，那八名士兵和悍马车在我来之前就消失了。”

Ignoring what Misato said about Kaji, Ritsuko asked, "Have you tried contacting them on the radio."  
无视美里关于加持的话，律子问道：“你有没有试着用无线电联系他们？”

"What do you think I just tried before I contacted you!?"  
“你以为我联系你之前没试过吗？！”

"So what are you suggesting, desertion?"  
"那么你是在建议，逃跑吗？"

"I don't know, and they can't know where to even go since I never told them."  
"我不清楚，而且他们也不知道该去哪儿，因为我从未告诉过他们。"

"Is it possible that they learned somehow?"  
"有没有可能是他们通过某种方式得知了呢？"

"I don't think so but-"  
"我不这么认为，但是——"

Misato paused, suddenly having an idea.  
美里顿了一下，突然有了一个主意。

"Ritsuko, you said before that the computers log every time that they're used. Can you check something for me?"  
"律子，你之前说过电脑每次使用都会被记录。你能帮我查一下吗？"

Understanding what she meant, Ritsuko hurriedly checked, and came back with the bad news.  
理解了她的意思，律子急忙检查，回来时带来了坏消息。

"Yesterday, at eleven at night, there was an unauthorized log. During this time, there was a communication log between someone at the command center, and an outside source. Unfortunately I can't pull it up. The other side deleted any traces of the conversation."  
“昨天晚上十一点，有一个未经授权的登录记录。在这段时间内，指挥中心某人与外部来源之间有通讯记录。不幸的是，我无法调出记录。对方删除了对话的所有痕迹。”

"We should have been more careful," said Misato in anger. "This is likely related to Seele."  
“我们应该更小心些，”美里愤怒地说，“这很可能与 Seele 有关。”

"It seems so. But what does Seele hope to gain from this?"  
"看来是的。但 Seele 希望通过此举获得什么呢？"

"I don't know, but I intend to find out. Keep digging and see if you can find anything about the source of the communication, I've got some catching up to do."  
"我不清楚，但我打算查明真相。继续深入挖掘，看看能否找到通信来源的线索，我得抓紧时间补上进度。"

"Got it," said Ritsuko. "明白了，" 赤木律子说道。"

Disconnecting the call, Misato jumped into the jeep and started the car, putting the gun back in the glovebox. Kaji followed, who had been silent so far, but now he spoke his mind.  
挂断电话后，美里跳上吉普车启动引擎，将枪放回手套箱。加持一直沉默不语，此刻他开口了。

"You may want to keep that nearby as you might need it."  
“你或许应该把它放在手边，可能会用得上。”

"You don't think it'll come to that, do you?"  
“你不觉得会到那一步，对吧？”

"It's possible that all the soldiers are involved in this, or it might just be one of them. If so, the commanding officer would be the most likely. Either way, it's best not to take any chances."  
可能所有士兵都参与了此事，也可能只是其中一人。若是后者，指挥官最有可能。无论如何，最好不要冒险。

Agreeing with this judgment, Misato kept the gun on the dash of the jeep as she sped passed the abandoned vehicles.  
同意这一判断，美里将枪放在吉普车的仪表盘上，疾驰过废弃的车辆。

---

There was a certain nervous energy that filled the two Humvee's as they barreled there way along the highway separating Tokyo-3 and Kyoto, something which the leader couldn't help but notice. The sergeant had been employed at the Nerv branch in Tokyo-3 for five years, and he was close to pushing forty now. He had been part of the peace keeping force within the United Nations before being reassigned to work at Nerv, and while Nerv had its own personal security team, it employed very few soldiers.  
两辆悍马沿着分隔东京-3 和京都的高速公路疾驰，车内弥漫着一种紧张的气氛，这让领队不禁注意到。这位中士在东京-3 的 NERV 分部工作了五年，如今已接近四十岁。他曾在联合国维和部队服役，后被调至 NERV 工作。尽管 NERV 有自己的安保团队，但雇佣的士兵并不多。

Glancing around the Humvee, he examined the three others that were with him. He knew them of course, though this was only with regards to their accomplishments and past. He had been part of a very small team that had defended the command center during the attack on Nerv, but had never entered combat with the people here. They didn't know him, and he didn't know them, but so was the way things played out. Still, as the commanding officer, they were required to follow him, even if they didn't agree with his decisions.  
环顾悍马车内的四周，他审视着与他同行的另外三人。当然，他对他们有所了解，但这仅限于他们的成就和过去。他曾是那支极小的队伍的一员，在 NERV 遭受攻击时保卫了指挥中心，但从未与这里的这些人并肩作战。他们不了解他，他也不了解他们，但事情就是这样发展的。尽管如此，作为指挥官，他们必须服从他的命令，即便他们不同意他的决定。

The initial problem of course came with Major Katsuragi's orders. He had to silence her somehow, at least to prevent any radio chatter. To do this, once all of them had geared up and were waiting for her to arrive, he decided to tell them the truth of this operation, that they were investigating the possibility of an Angel being found. Sometimes the truth, even if it was undesirable was the best way to gain trust. While some questioned him, he answered that the major had given him the extra details beforehand, and that she requested him to relay her orders to them once gathered. This raised some questions, but they believed their superiors orders. In doing so, he was able to turn off all the radios to prevent any of them checking this explanation of his.  
当然，最初的问题源自葛城美里少校的命令。他必须设法让她保持沉默，至少要防止无线电通讯中的嘈杂。为此，在他们全副武装并等待她到来之际，他决定向他们透露这次行动的真相——他们正在调查发现天使的可能性。有时，即便真相不尽如人意，却是赢得信任的最佳途径。尽管有人提出质疑，他解释说少校事先向他透露了更多细节，并要求他在集合后传达她的命令。这引起了一些疑问，但他们还是相信了上级的命令。借此，他得以关闭所有无线电设备，以防他们核实他的解释。

Still, investigating the possibility of an Angel wasn't something the others had expected, and they were doing whatever they could to keep there mind of it. Some chewed gum, some smoked, while some simply fidgeted in their seats. This was all fine as most soldiers, however much they would deny it, would be nervous going into combat. But a job was a job, and if they could get all the antsy feelings out beforehand, so much the better. He didn't need to deal with a mental breakdown.  
尽管如此，调查天使存在的可能性并非其他人所预料，他们正竭尽所能不去想这件事。有人嚼口香糖，有人抽烟，还有人只是坐在座位上不安地动来动去。这都没问题，因为大多数士兵，无论他们多么否认，上战场前都会紧张。但工作就是工作，如果能事先消除那些焦虑感，那就更好了。他不需要处理精神崩溃的问题。

Time was not on his side however, and he knew he only had about ten minutes to carry out the mission he had received before Major Katsuragi interfered.  
然而，时间并不站在他这边，他知道自己只有大约十分钟来执行接到的任务，之后葛城美里少校就会介入。

---

Misato nearly rolled the jeep multiples time as she sped along the corners doting the highway between Tokyo-3 and Kyoto. Kaji tried to calm her down several times, but this seemed to only anger her further. She was seething at how she could have let this happen. The sergeant had something else he intended to do, some other orders that he had received. Even if Seele was involved with this, what did they hope to accomplish by viewing this Angel? It didn't make any sense!  
美里驾驶吉普车在东京-3 与京都之间的高速公路上疾驰，几乎多次翻车。加持试图安抚她几次，但这似乎只会让她更加愤怒。她对自己如何让这种情况发生感到愤怒。这位中士还有其他打算，收到了其他命令。即使 Seele 与此事有关，他们希望通过观察这个天使实现什么目的？这毫无意义！

Maybe there was something in Kyoto that Seele wanted? Was it possible that one of the Mass-Produced Evangelions had somehow ended up there, or worse, had Unit 01 finished its battle there? If that was true, then they would have seen more destruction leading to Kyoto, but the landscape was largely intact. No, it had to be something else.  
或许京都有什么东西是 Seele 想要的？会不会是某台量产型 EVA 不知怎么到了那里，或者更糟，初号机在那里结束了战斗？如果真是那样，通往京都的路上应该会有更多破坏痕迹，但眼前的景象基本完好无损。不，一定是别的原因。

She has the catch up to the Humvee's. She wasn't sure what she could accomplish with only herself and Kaji, but maybe she could persuade them to turn back from whatever they were trying to accomplish. If it came to armed combat, she wasn't sure how useful two handguns would be against soldiers that had training ingrained into their very souls.  
她紧追着悍马车。不确定仅凭自己和加持能做些什么，但也许能说服他们放弃正在执行的任务。如果演变成武装冲突，她不确定两把手枪对上那些将训练融入灵魂的士兵能有多大作用。

---

More than an hour later, the two Humvee's entered the city limits of Kyoto. The last portion of the drive had been far easier than expected as the road ways were largely clear of cars that had been pushed off to the side. The sergeant wondered about this, but didn't mention it to the others.  
一个多小时后，两辆悍马车驶入了京都市区。最后一段路程比预想的要轻松许多，道路上的车辆大多被推到了一旁。中士对此感到疑惑，但没有向其他人提及。

Merging onto a different highway, they started heading north. The sergeant had the coordinates and he directed the driver, one of the other soldiers in the direction to head. Soon, civilization began to disappear behind them and farmland sprung up alongside them.  
他们驶入另一条高速公路，开始向北行进。中士掌握着坐标，他指示司机——另一名士兵——朝指定方向前进。很快，文明景象在他们身后逐渐消失，农田开始在两侧涌现。

They drove for another five minutes before the sergeant ordered the driver to turn off, taking an off ramp up and taking a right onto a two lane road. The area here was wide open, with farmland stretching on either side of them. Driving for another five minutes, they passed a sign indicating they were entering a small town.  
又行驶了五分钟后，中士命令司机驶离主路，上了一条匝道并向右转入一条双车道道路。这里地势开阔，两侧都是农田。再行驶五分钟，他们经过一个指示牌，显示即将进入一个小镇。

"Five minutes out," declared the sergeant. Sticking his hand out the window, he gestured with his hand to the Humvee behind them that they were five minutes away from the site. Including himself, the other seven soldiers started preparing, checking their automatic rifles, the gear that was strapped to them, and assisting each other as needed. The nervousness was starting to disappear, replaced with a cold calm.  
“还有五分钟，”中士宣布道。他伸出窗外，用手势向后面的悍马车示意，他们距离目的地还有五分钟。包括他在内，其他七名士兵开始准备，检查自动步枪，检查身上的装备，并相互协助。紧张感逐渐消退，取而代之的是一种冷静沉着。

Taking a left, they entered the small town, hardly paying attention to the small buildings they passed. Ascending a small hill, they entered a residential area, but quickly turned right, and up another hill. Passing under a group of trees, the houses disappeared from their sight, and trees lined them on either side, rows of them going up into the hills above them. Driving for another minute, the first Humvee turned right onto a narrow road.  
向左一拐，他们进入了这座小镇，几乎没留意沿途的小建筑。爬上一座小山丘，他们进入了住宅区，但很快又向右转，继续上坡。穿过一片树林，房屋从视线中消失，两侧树木成排，沿着山坡向上延伸。又行驶了一分钟，第一辆悍马右转驶入一条狭窄的小路。

"Thirty seconds," said the sergeant, simultaneously gesturing out the window to the Humvee behind them.  
“三十秒，”中士说道，同时向窗外示意他们后面的悍马车。

It was almost time.  
时机将近。

Misato turned onto the highway, gunning the jeep forward and directing it northward. She hadn't seen any sign of the Humvee's, but while passing the many cars which were crunched against the guardrail on the way here, she felt that something was amiss. Even if the Humvee's had managed to push the cars off to the side, it would have slowed them down considerably. So what was the answer to this then?  
美里驶上高速公路，猛踩油门让吉普车向前疾驰，朝北行进。她并未见到悍马车的踪影，但沿途经过许多撞上护栏的汽车时，她感到有些不对劲。即便悍马车设法将这些车辆推到一旁，也必定会大大减缓速度。那么，这背后的答案又是什么呢？

"Hey Kaji?" “喂，加持？”

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

They had been relatively silent with each other while Misato drove, but now she wanted to talk.  
在美里驾驶的过程中，两人相对沉默，但现在她想开口交谈。

"...If something happens to one of us-"  
"...如果其中一人出了什么事——"

"Don't mention something like that. Besides, I'm starting to get a feeling of deja vu that I don't like. Just continue driving. Whatever happens, happens."  
"别提这种事。再说，我开始有种不喜欢的既视感。继续开车吧。无论发生什么，都会发生的。"

Misato glanced over at him briefly before returning her eyes to the road. They were almost there Misato knew, but she was slightly afraid of what she might find when they got there.  
美里短暂地瞥了他一眼，随后又将目光转回路面。他们就快到了，美里心里清楚，但她对到达目的地后可能发现的事情感到一丝恐惧。

The two vehicles slowly descended the hill. The soldiers were now on heavy alert, ready for anything which might suddenly try and attack them, but the sergeant was relatively calm. His eyes were locked on a house barely visible through a group of trees at a fork at the bottom of the hill.  
两辆车缓缓驶下山坡。士兵们此刻高度戒备，随时准备应对可能突然发起的攻击，但中士相对镇定。他的目光紧锁着山脚下岔路口处，透过一片树木隐约可见的一座房屋。

They turned left slowly, seven weapons pointed out of the various windows of the Humvee's, looking through the dense trees.  
他们缓慢地向左转去，七支武器从悍马车的各个窗户伸出，透过浓密的树木搜寻着。

"I think I see something," suddenly said one of the soldiers near the sergeant.  
“我觉得我看到了什么，”突然间，中士旁边的一名士兵说道。

"Pull into the driveway here," said the sergeant checking the magazine in his rifle one final time.  
“在这里开进车道，”警官一边说，一边最后一次检查步枪中的弹匣。

The two vehicles pulled into the driveway, parking alongside each other. The house in front of them was two stories and had grey siding with two windows facing the driveway. The yard was moderate in size, but they hardly noticed these things. All eyes were locked on a figure standing in the middle of the driveway.  
两辆车驶入车道，并排停下。他们面前的房子是两层楼，灰色的外墙，车道方向有两扇窗户。院子大小适中，但他们几乎没注意到这些细节。所有人的目光都锁定在车道中央的一个身影上。

The soldiers slowly stepped out, each of their guns pointed at the figure. None of them had expected this development, none except the sergeant at least. Striding forward ahead of the other seven, he kept his gun trained at his target and asked in a loud voice that everyone in the vicinity could hear.  
士兵们缓缓下车，每个人的枪口都指向那个身影。他们中没有人预料到这种情况，至少除了警官之外。他大步走在其他七人前面，枪口始终对准目标，用响亮的声音问道，让附近所有人都能听到。

"Are you the Angel we were told to capture?"  
"你们就是我们要抓捕的天使吗？"

The person didn't respond, but the other seven soldiers tensed themselves, gripping their guns tighter. They hadn't expected the Angel to be a person, but they didn't rightfully understand what  
那人没有回应，但其他七名士兵却紧张起来，握紧了手中的枪。他们没想到天使会是个人，但首先他们并不真正理解天使是什么。他们的脑海告诉自己，这很可能是天使伪装成人类来欺骗他们。紧张的气氛弥漫在空气中，他们盯着站在面前的身影。那身影看起来就像一个年轻人，但他们都能感觉到他有些不对劲。汗水开始从他们的脸上滴落，他们慢慢地将瞄准点调整到那身影的头部。

an Angel was in the first case. It was likely trying to deceive them by posing as a human is what their minds told them. Tension filled the air as they stared at the figure standing before them. The figure looked just like a young man, but they all could tell that something was off about him. Sweat began dripping down their faces, and they slowly adjusted their aim to the figures head.  
那人没有回应，但其他七名士兵却紧张起来，握紧了手中的枪。他们没想到天使会是个人，但首先他们并不真正理解天使是什么。他们的脑海告诉自己，这很可能是天使伪装成人类来欺骗他们。紧张的气氛弥漫在空气中，他们盯着站在面前的身影。那身影看起来就像一个年轻人，但他们都能感觉到他有些不对劲。汗水开始从他们的脸上滴落，他们慢慢地将瞄准点调整到那身影的头部。

"I'll ask again," started the sergeant, "are you-"  
"我再问一次，" 中士开口道，"你是不是-"

"I'm only going to give you one chance. Leave now," spoke the figure quietly, but his voice carried in such a way that each of the soldiers knew. The figure had his hands in his pockets, but his words spoke volumes of what would happen if they tried anything.  
"我只给你们一次机会。现在离开，" 那身影平静地说，但他的声音却传达到了每一个士兵的心里。那身影双手插在口袋里，但他的话语却预示着如果他们轻举妄动将会发生什么。

Many of the soldiers paused, second guessing what they were doing. What about Major Katsuragi? Shouldn't they wait for her until they do anything?  
许多士兵停下了脚步，开始重新考虑他们的行动。卡苏拉吉少校怎么办？他们不应该等她来了再做决定吗？

The sergeant felt the other soldiers beginning to waver, but he had to give them a push forward.  
中士感觉到其他士兵开始动摇，但他必须推动他们前进。

"We can't wait for Major Katsuragi, we don't have the time to consider other options. This...thing, who knows what it could do if we let it go. Tokyo-3 will be in danger if we don't stop it here and now."  
我们不能等待葛城少校了，我们没有时间考虑其他选项。这个...东西，谁知道如果我们放任它，它会做出什么。如果我们不立即阻止它，第三新东京市将面临危险。

The sergeant knew otherwise of course. What his real purpose here was something which he couldn't tell the other soldiers. He had received orders to capture, or failing to do so, kill this thing, this human at all costs, even if it meant sacrificing everyone here.  
当然，中士知道实际情况并非如此。他真正的任务是什么，他不能告诉其他士兵。他接到的命令是无论如何都要捕获，或者如果失败，不惜一切代价杀死这个东西，这个人，即使这意味着牺牲这里的所有人。

He had heard rumors, rumors about the special existence of this thing that Nerv had done its best to conceal from the lower employees. He had other superiors however, who told him the truth. Everything was just a ruse, a fabrication that Nerv had created, but this thing was still special, that much was apparent. He was ordered to capture it, or if that proved impossible, to kill it. He had no idea what his superiors wanted this thing for, but that it was unique in someway. He had been promised a special position in the new world that they would be creating, and he was sick of his current life.  
他曾听说过一些传闻，关于 Nerv 竭力向底层员工隐瞒的特殊存在。然而，他还有其他上级，他们向他透露了真相。这一切都只是一个幌子，Nerv 制造的假象，但这个东西确实非同寻常，这一点显而易见。他被命令要捕获它，如果这不可能，就消灭它。他不知道上级为何需要这个东西，但它显然有某种独特之处。他被许诺在新世界中将获得一个特殊位置，而他早已厌倦了现在的生活。

"It seems like you won't listen," said the figure with a small sigh.  
“看来你是不会听劝了，”那个身影轻叹道。

At his words, a strong wind blew through the driveway, shaking the pine trees and bushes. His shaggy hair blew in the wind, and his eyes seemed to darken suddenly.  
他的话音刚落，一阵强风穿过了车道，摇动着松树和灌木丛。他蓬乱的头发在风中飘扬，眼神似乎突然变得深邃。

Readjusting his own rifle, the sergeant aimed his gun at the figures head. Motioning to the men behind him with a jerk of his head, eight fingers slowly depressed the trigger on eight automatic rifles and...  
中士重新调整了自己的步枪，瞄准了那个身影的头部。他猛地一甩头示意身后的士兵们，八根手指缓缓压下扳机，八支自动步枪随即...

Fired. 开火。

Bullets erupted out of the cylindrical barrels of the automatic rifles, each carving a path through the air towards the figures head. In less than a second, the figures head would explode, brain matter and skull fragments scattering across the ground and painting the garage door behind him a bloody red. At least, this is what was supposed to happen.  
子弹从自动步枪的圆筒形枪管中喷涌而出，每一颗都在空中划出轨迹，直奔那身影的头部。不到一秒钟，那身影的头部就会爆炸，脑浆和头骨碎片四溅，将他身后的车库门染成血红色。至少，这是本该发生的情景。

A flash of orange exploded around the person, a dome projecting around him. The bullets instantly vaporized as they came in contact with the strange energy. The soldiers had barely fired their guns before they were given time to react to this absurd phenomenon, but the person in front of them was still standing, unscathed. He hadn't even moved, gave no inclination that he had even done anything, but the strange dome surrounded him completely; his hands were still in his pockets.  
一团橙色光芒在人影周围炸裂，形成一个穹顶笼罩着他。子弹一接触到这奇异的能量便瞬间汽化。士兵们刚开枪不久，就有时间对这荒谬的现象做出反应，但眼前的人依旧毫发无损地站着。他甚至没有动弹，没有任何迹象表明他做了什么，但那奇异的穹顶完全包围了他；他的双手依然插在口袋里。

"Don't let him faze you! Keep firing!" bellowed the sergeant.  
“别被他吓到！继续射击！”中士咆哮道。

The initial shock quickly wore off, and the soldiers continued firing, bullets whizzing through the air. For all their attempts though, it was altogether pointless. The orange dome destroyed the bullets the moment they came in contact with it.  
最初的震惊很快消退，士兵们继续开火，子弹在空中呼啸而过。尽管他们竭尽全力，但这一切都是徒劳的。橙色穹顶在子弹接触到它的瞬间便将其摧毁。

Spending all their bullets in the first magazine, they began reloading, but this was when the person struck back. Like a whip with a mind of its own, a large spear thrust out from the middle of the dome, weaving its way at high speeds until it struck its target, impaling one of the soldiers that was having difficulty reloading. His body was raised up in the air, blood dripping out from the large hole in his abdomen, and then flung almost casually away where it struck a nearby tree. His body lay motionless as blood continue flowing.  
在第一个弹匣的子弹全部耗尽后，他们开始重新装填，但就在这时，那个人发起了反击。如同拥有自主意识的鞭子，一根巨大的长矛从穹顶中央猛地刺出，高速穿梭，直至击中目标，贯穿了一名正在艰难装弹的士兵。他的身体被高高举起，腹部的大洞中血液不断滴落，随后被随意地甩开，撞上了附近的一棵树。他的身体一动不动地躺在那里，鲜血继续流淌。

"Shit!" exclaimed the sergeant. "Spread out and surround him! Don't bunch up!"  
“该死！”中士喊道，“散开包围他！不要聚在一起！”

The soldiers spread out in all directions, surrounding the person, continuing to fire their guns. A hail of bullets erupted around the figure, but the orange dome protected him from every direction.  
士兵们向四面八方散开，包围了那个人，继续开火。子弹如雨点般在人影周围爆发，但橙色的穹顶全方位保护着他。

'Shit!' thought the sergeant as he watched the impossible sight before his eyes. 'This wasn't how things were supposed to be. What the fuck were those people saying that it was all a lie!?'  
“该死！”中士心中暗想，目睹眼前这不可思议的景象。“事情不应该是这样的。那些人说的都是谎言吗！？”

As he thought this however, gaps started to appear in the dome. The soldiers briefly thought that they had finally begun wearing down the strange dome and began adjusted their guns to aim for the narrow gaps that opened up, but each time the bullets were deflected as the gaps were shorn up. It was like they were being taunted, or that the strange orange energy had a mind of his own.  
然而，正当他这么想时，穹顶开始出现裂缝。士兵们短暂地以为他们终于开始削弱这奇怪的穹顶，开始调整枪口瞄准那些狭窄的裂缝，但每次子弹都被弹开，裂缝随即被修复。仿佛他们在被嘲弄，又或者那奇怪的橙色能量有自己的意识。

Next second, the dome shifted. From the center, a circular blade similar to a saw blade whipped outward, still connected to the dome, darting its way to one of the soldiers. Screaming wildly, a flurry of bullets assaulted the orange blade, but to no avail. The blade bisected the soldiers body at the waist, cutting him cleanly in half. A fountain of blood erupted from the two halves that were cut, as his upper half went flying through the air, his finger still squeezing the trigger where it eventfully fell to the pavement with a thud. His lower body fell backwards, the legs sticking outwards, blood dribbling down the driveway.  
下一秒，穹顶移动了。从中心向外甩出一个圆形的锯齿刀片，仍与穹顶相连，直奔其中一名士兵而去。士兵尖叫着，密集的子弹疯狂地射向橙色刀片，却无济于事。刀片从腰部将士兵的身体干净利落地一分为二。两截断体喷涌出鲜血，上半身飞向空中，手指仍紧扣着扳机，最终砰的一声落在路面上。下半身向后倒下，双腿向外伸着，血沿着车道缓缓流下。

The remaining soldiers began to be panic stricken, firing wildly. This thing, this monster was picking them off without a second thought almost casually as though he didn't even view them as living beings. How were they supposed to fight something like this? How was anybody supposed to stand up and deal with this situation?  
剩下的士兵开始陷入恐慌，胡乱开枪。这个怪物，这个恶魔，几乎毫不犹豫地一个个将他们击倒，仿佛视他们为无生命的存在，轻松得如同儿戏。他们该如何对抗这样的东西？任何人又该如何面对这样的局面？

Quick as a flash, there thoughts were interrupted as a large wall surged outward from the center of the orange dome, crashing against another soldier. The gun he held in his hand was crushed instantly, and the arm which held it spiraled backwards as a sickening crunch filled the air. He didn't even have enough time to scream while the bones in his arm were crushed, since his entire body was being pulverized like a butcher flattening a piece of raw beef.  
快如闪电，这些思绪被突然打断，一道巨大的墙壁从橙色圆顶中心向外涌出，猛烈撞击另一名士兵。他手中的枪瞬间被压碎，握枪的手臂扭曲着向后折断，令人作呕的碎裂声充斥着空气。他甚至来不及尖叫，因为手臂的骨头被碾碎，整个身体就像屠夫压平一块生牛肉一样被粉碎。

The wall sent his body flying backwards, the lightweight armor he had offering no protection. His torso contorted, the organs inside him crushed under the immense pressure, and his ribcage collapsed on itself, puncturing both his lungs. Blood spilled out of his mouth, or what was vaguely recognized as a mouth since his face was nothing but a bloody husk. His skull fragmented in multiple places, the blood vessels in his eyes popping as he went reeling backwards through the air. He was dead before he hit the ground.  
墙壁将他的身体向后抛飞，他身上的轻型装甲毫无保护作用。他的躯干扭曲，内脏在巨大压力下被压碎，肋骨塌陷刺穿了双肺。血液从他的口中涌出，或者说那勉强被认作是嘴的部分，因为他的脸已经变成了一团血肉模糊的残骸。他的头骨多处碎裂，眼球中的血管爆裂，他在空中翻滚着向后飞去。他还没落地就已经死了。

The remaining five soldiers watched this in horror, unable to move or make a sound as they watched another of there comrades fall. Regaining his senses, one of the soldiers screamed in fury, and then grabbed something that was attached to his vest.  
剩下的五名士兵惊恐地目睹了这一幕，动弹不得，也无法发出声音，眼睁睁看着又一位战友倒下。恢复理智后，其中一名士兵愤怒地尖叫起来，随即抓住了系在背心上的某样东西。

"Die you fucking monster!" he screamed as he pulled the pin on of the frag grenade, reeling his arm back to throw it. Suddenly, he felt a feeling of weightlessness assault his right arm. Why should that be? He had thought he swung his arm forward intending to throw the grenade at the monster in front of him, but now he didn't feel anything from his right side.  
“去死吧，你这该死的怪物！”他尖叫着拔掉手榴弹的保险销，挥臂准备投掷。突然，他感到右臂一阵失重。为什么会这样？他本以为自己挥臂向前，打算将手榴弹扔向面前的怪物，但现在他右半边什么感觉都没有了。

His eyes caught something in the air, and he glanced upwards just in time to see something spinning through the air and then land at his feet. It was an arm and at the end was a grenade tightly clutched in a hand. Wondering where it had come from, he glanced to his right side, his face draining of color as he saw flesh and bone sticking out of his shoulder. As realization dawned on him, he opened his mouth to scream, and then the grenade went off at his feet.  
他的目光捕捉到空中的一物，抬头一看，正好看到某样东西在空中旋转，然后落在他脚边。那是一条手臂，末端紧握着一颗手榴弹。他疑惑这手臂从何而来，转头看向右侧，脸色顿时煞白，只见肩头血肉模糊，骨头外露。意识到真相的他张嘴欲喊，随即手榴弹在他脚边爆炸。

His severed arm instantly disappeared, and the flesh on his legs was ripped off, fragments of metal from the grenade peppering his entire body. Coupled with the blood flowing from his shoulder, he dropped to the ground and passed out from blood loss, dying in a matter of seconds.  
他那被斩断的手臂瞬间消失，双腿上的肉被撕裂，手榴弹的金属碎片如雨点般洒满全身。加上从肩膀流出的鲜血，他倒在地上，因失血过多而昏迷，几秒钟内便死去。

This wasn't the only casualty as a result of the grenade. The soldier who was closest to him, who stood perhaps ten feet away wasn't caught in the initial blast, but the shrapnel from the explosion peppered his body all the same.  
这并非手榴弹造成的唯一伤亡。离他最近的士兵，或许站在十英尺外，虽未被最初的爆炸波及，但爆炸产生的弹片同样如雨点般击中他的身体。

Chunks of metal cut into his arms, legs, and gouged out deep rivets in his face leaving it pockmarked. He screamed shrilly as blood began pouring down his face, turning his vision red as it got into his eyes. He dropped his gun and his hands grabbed at his neck were a deep laceration had cut into his throat; blood began bubbling out of his mouth, silencing his screams.  
金属碎片切入他的手臂、双腿，并在脸上挖出深深的凹痕，使其布满坑洞。他尖叫着，鲜血开始从脸上倾泻而下，染红了视线，渗入眼中。他丢下枪，双手紧抓着颈部一道深切的割伤，鲜血从口中冒泡而出，他的尖叫声随之沉寂。

Completely paralyzed with fear over his impending death, he didn't even notice the multiple orange blades which came whipping towards him until they had pierced his chest, destroying his internal organs and effectively putting him out of his misery.  
在即将到来的死亡恐惧中完全瘫痪，他甚至没有注意到那些疾驰而来的多把橙色刀刃，直到它们刺穿他的胸膛，摧毁了他的内脏，有效地结束了他的痛苦。

In less than five minutes since they had started shooting, the soldiers numbers had dropped from eight, to three. The sergeant couldn't believe how quickly there numbers had dwindled.  
不到五分钟，自从他们开始射击以来，士兵的数量已经从八人减少到三人。中士无法相信他们的数量竟然如此迅速地减少。

Sure, he had been prepared to lose a few, but not in this short of a time. This creature in front of him was inhuman, and he knew now that he had been lied to.  
当然，他已准备好牺牲一些，但不是在这么短的时间内。眼前这个生物非人般的存在，他现在明白自己被欺骗了。

The words 'retreat' were half formed on his lips before he heard a sudden scream come from his left. One of the soldiers had clearly lost what little mental restraint he had maintained, and had dropped his gun, running at full sprint back to the Humvee's parked at the end of the driveway. The second soldier followed without so much as a glance at him, and the sergeant admitted that the operation was a failure.  
‘撤退’二字刚到嘴边，他便听到左侧突然传来一声尖叫。一名士兵显然已失去了仅存的心理防线，丢下枪，全速跑向停在车道尽头的那辆悍马。第二名士兵紧随其后，连看都没看他一眼，中士不得不承认这次行动失败了。

Turning and running back himself, he watched the first soldier jump into the driver seat, and thought that he would immediately gun in backwards. The second soldier clambered up into the cab, swinging alongside the driver, and then the sergeant reached the vehicle, jumping in as well. There were only two seats in front, but the sergeant didn't even want to waste an extra second to open the side doors. All three of them were crammed into the front, the second soldiers sitting on the center console.  
他转身跟着往回跑，看到第一名士兵跳进驾驶座，心想他会立刻倒车。第二名士兵爬上车，坐在驾驶座旁边，随后中士也赶到车旁，跳了进去。前排只有两个座位，但中士连浪费一秒钟去开侧门的时间都不愿意。三个人挤在前排，第二名士兵坐在中央控制台上。

"Get us the fuck out of here!" screamed the sergeant to the first soldier. The words were hardly even out of his mouth when the engine started, and the Humvee jerked backwards.  
“他妈的带我们离开这儿！”中士冲第一名士兵吼道。话音未落，引擎已经启动，悍马猛地向后一退。

A shrill sound enveloped their ears however, as though someone had just taken nails to a chalk board, and the three of them stared ahead horror struck at what they saw. Though the figure hadn't bothered moving an inch even when they had scrambled to leave, the orange dome was no longer surrounding him, but a narrow blade of energy had traveled towards them at a speed they couldn't perceive, and had pierced the Humvee's engine compartment.  
一阵刺耳的声音笼罩了他们的耳朵，仿佛有人正用指甲刮擦黑板，三人惊恐地盯着眼前的一幕。尽管那身影在他们仓皇逃离时未曾移动分毫，原本环绕他的橙色光罩已不复存在，取而代之的是一道细长的能量刃，以他们无法察觉的速度朝他们袭来，穿透了悍马车的引擎舱。

"It won't move!" said the first soldier as his foot repeatedly stomped the gas.  
“动不了了！”第一名士兵说着，脚不停地猛踩油门。

The sergeant opened his mouth to say something, but he was cut short as his eardrums rumbled again, and a certain wetness assaulted the left side of his face. At first he thought his left side was sliced into and that his blood was now spraying all over the Humvee, but he was only half wrong.  
中士张嘴想说些什么，但他的耳膜再次轰鸣，左脸颊突然感到一阵湿润。起初他以为自己的左脸被切开，鲜血正喷溅在悍马车内，但他只猜对了一半。

The soldier next to him, the one who had been sitting in the center, his skull had been cloven in two, bone fragments and brain matter splattering the windshield. The top of the Humvee had been cut into, the metal sliced easily as though it was butter until the narrow blade of orange energy cut into the soldiers skull.  
他身边的士兵，那个一直坐在中间的，头骨被劈成了两半，骨头碎片和脑浆溅满了挡风玻璃。悍马车顶被切开，金属如同黄油般轻易被划开，直到那道细长的橙色能量刃切入士兵的头颅。

The sergeant felt bile coming up his throat as he saw the steady drip of blood flowing from the dead soldiers skull, but the driver had had enough. He scrambled out of the Humvee, falling face first onto the pavement and began running as far away as he could.  
中士感到喉咙涌上一股胆汁，他看到从阵亡士兵头颅中不断滴落的血，但驾驶员已经受够了。他慌忙爬出悍马，脸朝下跌在路面上，然后开始尽可能远地逃跑。

The sergeant rolled out moments later, and quickly glanced over at the second Humvee, but the engine compartment had already been destroyed at some point. Glancing back up the driveway, he saw the figure still standing there, hands deep in his pockets and a casual smirk on his lips. Air rushed by the sergeant, and he thought he felt something like a bullet narrowly miss his skull, but the figure wasn't aiming for him.  
中士随后滚了出来，迅速瞥了一眼第二辆悍马，但引擎舱早已在某刻被摧毁。他回头望向车道，看到那身影依旧站在那里，双手深深插在口袋里，嘴角挂着随意的冷笑。一阵风掠过中士，他感觉像是子弹险些擦过他的头骨，但那身影并未瞄准他。

The other soldier had long left the property of the house, running across the narrow road and into the row of trees on the other side. He zigzagged left and right, darting between trees,  
另一名士兵早已离开房屋的领地，穿过狭窄的道路，跑进了对面的一排树木中。他左右穿梭，在树丛间疾驰，

hoping that without a direct line of sight, he couldn't be injured; he didn't even notice that he had soiled his pants at some point during the past few minutes. Finally feeling that he had run far enough, he paused against a tree to catch his breath, and looked back over his shoulder. He couldn't even see a glimpse of the house or the road, and breathed a sigh of relief. Turning away from where he had come, he took one step, and then fell face forward into the dirt with a cry of pain.  
希望在没有直接视线的情况下，自己不会受到伤害；他甚至没有注意到自己在过去几分钟的某个时刻弄脏了裤子。终于觉得跑得够远了，他靠在一棵树上喘口气，回头望去。他连房屋和道路的一丝踪影都看不见，松了一口气。转身离开来时的方向，他迈出一步，随即面朝下摔倒在泥土中，发出痛苦的叫喊。

He couldn't pick himself up and didn't understand why this was until he managed to role over, and saw both his legs lying on the ground two feet away from him. He screamed again, but his voice was cut off sharply as a flash of orange erupted in front of him, and his head went sailing through the air.  
他无法站起身来，直到勉强翻过身，才明白原因——他的两条腿躺在离他两英尺远的地面上。他再次尖叫，但声音戛然而止，一团橙色火焰在他面前爆发，他的头颅随之飞向空中。

When the scream was cut of suddenly, the sergeant knew that he was the only one remaining. Slowly, he turned to face the figure who was still standing at the top of the driveway. There was no longer any dome surrounding him, almost as though he was inviting the sergeant to attack him. At this point, the sergeant knew that he would never leave here alive, but at the very most, he could do his damnedest to kill this thing.  
当那声尖叫戛然而止时，中士明白他是唯一幸存的人了。他缓缓转身，面对着仍站在车道顶端的身影。原本环绕他的穹顶已不复存在，仿佛在邀请中士发起攻击。此刻，中士深知自己无法活着离开此地，但至少，他可以竭尽全力去消灭这个怪物。

Swinging his gun around in a flurry, he squeezed the trigger, aiming only around the person without precisely aiming at his face. Flashes of orange erupted one after another as each of the bullets fired from his gun was struck down. It was almost like he was predicting the trajectory of the bullets and destroying them as such. This monster just kept defying the sergeants common sense more and more each time.  
他急速挥动枪支，紧扣扳机，只是大致瞄准那人周围而非精确对准其面孔。橙色的闪光接连爆发，每一颗从枪中射出的子弹都被击落。这几乎像是他能预判子弹的轨迹并如此摧毁它们。这个怪物一次又一次地挑战着中士的常识。

Running forward, he continued spraying bullets wildly, some of which ricocheted off the driveway, or struck the walls of the house. He was inching closer now to the figure, nearly within distance to strike with his fist. When he reached a certain distance, the orange dome came down, sealing him inside of a closed space along with the monster. Now only a mere five feet away from his target, he squeezed the trigger, believing that no being could possibly stop a bullet from this distance.  
他向前狂奔，继续胡乱喷射子弹，有些子弹在车道上弹开，或是击中了房屋的墙壁。他正逐渐逼近那个身影，几乎到了可以用拳头攻击的距离。当他到达一定距离时，橙色的穹顶落下，将他和怪物一起封闭在一个密闭空间内。现在距离目标仅剩五英尺，他紧扣扳机，相信没有任何生物能从这个距离阻止子弹。

A flash of orange came down suddenly in front of him, and his gun exploded. Before the bullet had even exited the barrel, it was sliced in two, the gun falling apart in his hands. The firing mechanism had sparked the bullet forward, but since the bullet was sliced, it exploded, and the sergeants fingers were caught in the ensuing explosion, the tips of his right hand mangled into bloody lumps.  
突然间，一抹橙色闪现在他面前，他的枪爆炸了。子弹甚至还没离开枪管就被切成两半，枪支在他手中解体。击发机构将子弹向前推进，但由于子弹被切开，它爆炸了，中士的手指被卷入随之而来的爆炸中，右手尖端被炸成血肉模糊的肉块。

The sergeant screamed, and took a step back, but adrenaline was pumping through his body with no thought to his own safety. His left hand darted down, grabbing the pistol holstered at his hip. He swung it up, intending to fire, but before he even had a chance to squeeze the trigger, it was cut in two.  
中士尖叫着，后退了一步，但肾上腺素在他体内奔涌，全然不顾自身安危。他的左手迅速向下，抓住了挂在腰间的枪套里的手枪。他举起枪，准备射击，但还没来得及扣动扳机，枪就被切成了两截。

Not relenting, he screamed in fury, threw the broken gun to the side, and swung his fist forward. His fist made contact, but it wasn't with the person in front of him. An orange wall sprang up in front of him, which his fist made contact with. Instantly, the bones in his hand fractured, and the skin surrounding the bone peeled away, blood beginning the flow from the multiple wounds.  
他毫不退缩，愤怒地尖叫着，将破损的枪扔到一旁，挥拳向前。他的拳头击中了某物，但并非眼前的人。一道橙色的墙壁在他面前升起，他的拳头与之相撞。瞬间，他手上的骨头断裂，周围的皮肉剥离，鲜血从多处伤口涌出。

Howling in pain, he instead aimed a kick high, but suddenly lost his balance and fell backwards. His equilibrium was thrown off as he kicked, and didn't realize that the leg he had been kicking with was no longer attached to his body, causing him to fall over. Screaming once again when he saw his detached leg lying beside him, he began crawling on his hands and knees away, but was of course still encased in the orange dome.  
他痛苦地嚎叫着，改为高踢一脚，却突然失去平衡向后倒去。踢腿时他的平衡被打破，并未意识到踢出的那条腿已不再属于他，导致他摔倒在地。看到自己断腿躺在旁边，他再次尖叫，开始用手和膝盖爬行逃离，但当然仍被橙色穹顶困住。

He felt searing pain in the back of his remaining leg, and saw that it was pierced by that same orange energy. Unable to move, all he could do was stare across the driveway to the humvee's and the bodies of the other soldiers. The driveway had long turned slick with blood.  
他感到剩下那条腿的后部传来灼热的疼痛，发现已被那橙色能量刺穿。动弹不得的他只能凝视着车道对面那些悍马车和士兵的尸体。车道早已被鲜血浸透。

Doing his best to turn around, he felt the muscles on his legs tearing as he turned to face the hateful monster. When he finally got turned around, he was surprised to see that the person had finally moved, and was now standing before him, looking down almost pitifully at him. This angered the sergeant immensely, thinking that this thing could even understand how he felt at this moment.  
他竭尽全力转身，感觉到腿部肌肉在撕裂，当他终于转过身来面对那可憎的怪物时，惊讶地发现对方已经移动了位置，现在正站在他面前，几乎怜悯地俯视着他。这让中士极为愤怒，认为这东西甚至能理解他此刻的感受。

"Fuck you," he managed to utter through half closed lips.  
“去你妈的，”他勉强从半闭的嘴唇中挤出这句话。

Next second several flashed appeared around him, and both his arms were pinned to the ground, orange stakes imbedded into his arms. At this point, his body was so numb with pain that he could barely feel anything at this point. His higher functions, namely his brain, we're finally shutting off.  
下一秒，几道闪光出现在他周围，他的双臂被钉在地上，橙色的桩子嵌入他的手臂。此时，他的身体因疼痛而麻木，几乎感觉不到任何东西。他的高级功能，即大脑，终于开始关闭。

He longed to spit on this persons face, but didn't think he had enough energy left. So he opened his lips to say something.  
他渴望朝这人脸上吐唾沫，但觉得自己已没有足够的力气。于是他张开嘴唇，想说些什么。

"Fuck yo-" “去你妈——”

His chest was suddenly impaled, both his lungs crushed instantly, blood spewing out of his lips instead of words.  
他的胸膛突然被刺穿，双肺瞬间被压碎，鲜血从唇间喷涌而出，代替了言语。

"I did warn you to leave, though you didn't listen. So this is what happened," spoke the figure with a slight sigh as though he himself was weary with all this.  
“我确实警告过你离开，虽然你没听。所以这就是结果，”那个身影略带叹息地说道，仿佛他自己也对这一切感到疲惫。

The sergeant wasn't listening however, his eyes glazed over, death slowly approaching.  
然而，中士并没有在听，他的眼睛呆滞无光，死亡正缓缓逼近。

He didn't even feel any difference as the thin orange blade pierced his neck.  
他甚至没有感觉到任何差异，那把细长的橙色刀刃刺穿了他的脖子。

For the sergeant, darkness closed in on him. The trees fades, the house faded, even the figure in front of him faded until he was laying in a pool of his own blood surrounded only by darkness. He could only wait until he finally died, and closed his eyes, waiting for said moment. Finally, he felt white light pierce through his closed eyelids, and knew that he was dead...  
对于这位中士来说，黑暗逐渐吞噬了他。树木模糊了，房子消失了，甚至连他面前的身影也逐渐淡去，直到他躺在一滩自己的血泊中，四周只剩下黑暗。他只能等待，直到最终死去，闭上了眼睛，等待那一刻的到来。终于，他感觉到白光穿透了他紧闭的眼睑，知道他已经死了...

.

..

...

...But his eyelids now opened. Sound and smell returned to him and while he couldn't move his body he could take in what surrounded him. But, it didn't make any sense as to why he was here. He...he had died...so why was that figure still standing there motionlessly with his hands in his pockets still?  
...但他的眼睑现在却睁开了。声音和气味回到了他身边，尽管他无法移动身体，但他能感知周围的一切。然而，这一切都不合逻辑，他...他已经死了...那么为什么那个身影仍然一动不动地站在那里，双手插在口袋里呢？

Suddenly, the sergeant vomited, while simultaneously his bladder emptied, soiling his pants. Around him, the other seven soldiers were lying on their backs or stomachs, each of them either vomiting, shitting, pissing themselves, or a combination of all three. Not a single one of them was injured, and all their guns lay forsaken on the ground beside them. The guns still had the initial magazine in them, and not a single bullet had been fired. How was this possible?  
突然间，中士呕吐起来，同时他的膀胱也失禁了，弄脏了他的裤子。在他周围，其他七名士兵有的仰面朝天，有的趴在地上，每个人都在呕吐、拉屎、尿尿，或者三者兼有。他们中没有一个人受伤，所有的枪都丢弃在地上，枪里还装着最初的弹匣，没有一颗子弹被射出。这怎么可能呢？

"So...I'll ask you once again. Leave, and don't come back," spoke the figure with a sigh.  
"那么...我再问你一次。离开，不要再回来，" 那个身影叹息着说道。

None of the soldiers had the ability to respond, each of them still remembering how they had each died.  
士兵们没有一个能做出回应，他们每个人都还记得自己是怎么死的。

"Though I suppose you won't be able to move right away. Either way, something else is coming."  
"虽然我想你们一时半会儿也动不了。无论如何，有别的东西正在靠近。"

After his words, moments later, the sound of an engine roaring could be heard from what appeared to be far away. The sound grew louder, and tires began screeching as the vehicle slowed down as it approached its destination. Seconds later, a vehicle swung into the driveway, but slammed the breaks when it saw the two Humvee's parked in front.  
话音刚落，片刻之后，远处似乎传来了引擎的轰鸣声。声音越来越响，随着车辆减速接近目的地，轮胎开始发出刺耳的摩擦声。几秒钟后，一辆车驶入车道，但看到停在前面两辆悍马时猛地踩下了刹车。

Misato and Kaji jumped out of the jeep and quickly glanced at each other, unsure what to expect. Each of them has their pistols drawn as were prepared for the worst, but something was bothering each of them. Slowly, they inched there way along the Humvee's, and then Misato saw the bodies of the soldiers sprawled on the pavement. At first she thought they were dead, but the moans that escaped there mouth disproved this. She noticed the vomit and smell of excrement, and questions began appearing in her mind, but Kaji brought her out of this.  
美里和加持从吉普车上跳下，迅速对视一眼，不知将会遭遇什么。两人都拔出手枪，做好了最坏的准备，但心中都有所顾虑。他们缓缓沿着悍马车移动，随后美里看到了躺在人行道上的士兵们。起初她以为他们都死了，但那些从他们嘴里发出的呻吟声否定了这一点。她注意到呕吐物和粪便的气味，心中涌现出许多疑问，但加持将她拉回了现实。

"...Misato..." mumbled Kaji, his gaze directed up the driveway, while his gun hung limply at his side.  
“……美里……”加持低声说道，目光投向车道上方，手中的枪无力地垂在身侧。

Slowly, Misato followed his gaze up, passed the collapsed soldiers, and to the person who stood at the top looking down on them with a slight frown on his face.  
慢慢地，美里顺着他的目光向上看去，越过倒地的士兵，望向站在顶端俯视他们的人，那人脸上带着一丝皱眉的表情。

"...Shin...ji...?" spoke Misato, not believing what she was seeing. But no, this couldn't be him, this person was far older, taller, and more mature it seemed. Shinji was only fifteen years old after all.  
“...真...治...？”美里说道，不敢相信自己的眼睛。但不对，这个人看起来要年长得多，更高大，也更成熟。毕竟，真治才十五岁。

"How do you know my name?" the person spoke suddenly.  
“你怎么知道我的名字？”那人突然开口问道。

"...Shinji...its me...Misato?" Some sort of expression seemed to pass over his face, but Misato couldn't tell what it was.  
"...真嗣...是我...美里？" 某种表情似乎掠过他的脸庞，但美里无法分辨那是什么。

"Are you with these soldiers?" he gestured to the men lying on the ground nearly comatose.  
"你和这些士兵在一起吗？" 他示意那些躺在地上几乎昏迷的士兵。

Misato opened her mouth to say something, but closed it slowly. She got the idea that Shinji had done something to these soldiers to make them like this, but she didn't know what. She still couldn't believe that Shinji was here, or why he was older, but she understood that Shinji was wary about them. Had the soldiers tried to do something?  
美里张嘴想说些什么，但又慢慢闭上了。她隐约觉得真嗣对这些士兵做了什么，才让他们变成这样，但她并不清楚具体是什么。她仍然无法相信真嗣会在这里，或者为什么他看起来更年长，但她明白真嗣对他们有所戒备。是士兵们试图做了什么吗？

The sergeant was listening in to this conversation even though his body still hurt to much to move. The Major knew this person, who she called Shinji, but he didn't seem to recognize her. He didn't understand what was happening between them, but he did potentially see a way out. In his peripheral vision however, he caught movement in the upstairs window, and saw the curtain flutter briefly. Was somebody else in the house?  
尽管身体疼痛到无法动弹，中士仍在偷听这段对话。少校认识这个她称之为真嗣的人，但他似乎没有认出她。他不明白他们之间发生了什么，但他确实看到了一个可能的出路。然而，在他的余光中，他注意到楼上窗户有动静，窗帘短暂地飘动了一下。房子里还有其他人吗？

"I'll ask again. Are you with these soldiers?"  
“我再问一次。你和这些士兵是一伙的吗？”

There was something stifling in the air now as the person spoke, and Misato felt like she was teetering on the edge of a cliff. What was wrong with Shinji? Why didn't he recognize her?  
当那人说话时，空气中弥漫着一种压抑的气氛，美里感觉自己仿佛站在悬崖边上。真嗣怎么了？为什么他不认识她？

"I'm going to assume from your silence, that you are, which means that you're just the same as them," he said gesturing to the soldiers. "I'll give you time to gather them up and leave, but if you try and approach me, or even talk to me, I'll-"  
"我将从你的沉默中假设，你是，这意味着你和他们一样，"他边说边向士兵们示意。"我会给你时间召集他们离开，但如果你试图接近我，甚至和我说话，我就会-"

He stopped short as the sound of a sliding door opened and closed sharply from the side of the house, and then running feet announced the presence of somebody else. Misato felt herself inhale sharply as she saw a woman with long red hair round the corner and march straight towards the man standing in the driveway.  
他话音未落，侧边房子的滑动门突然打开又猛地关上，紧接着是急促的脚步声，预示着有其他人到来。Misato 感到自己倒吸了一口气，只见一个长发红发的女子绕过拐角，径直向站在车道上的男子走去。

"What are you doing?" she asked pointedly towards the man, giving a brief glance in Misato's direction.  
"你在做什么？"她直截了当地问那男子，顺便向 Misato 的方向瞥了一眼。

"I thought I told you to stay inside until it was safe," he said with a frown.  
"我以为我告诉过你，要待在屋里直到安全为止，" 他皱着眉说。

"Things have changed," she said again pointedly.  
"情况变了，" 她再次一针见血地说。

"But what about-" "但那关于——"

The woman with red hair silenced him with a look, and then glanced down the driveway towards Misato and Kaji standing there dumbstruck at the two arguing with each other. Slowly, the woman began walking towards them, giving a wide berth to the soldiers who still lay on the ground, but the man hadn't finished talking yet.  
红发女子一个眼神就让他说不出话来，随后她瞥向车道尽头，看到美里和加持站在那里，目瞪口呆地看着两人争吵。女子缓缓向他们走去，绕开了仍躺在地上的士兵，但那男子还没说完话。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"Cool it Shinji. I'm fine," the woman spoke as she drew near to Misato.  
“冷静点，真嗣。我没事，”女子走近美里时说道。

She approached Misato, ignoring the man behind her who was still staring at Misato and Kaji. As she reached them, Misato saw that they were close to the same height now, and this somehow put it all in perspective. Even though she was older however, the face, the blue eyes, and the vivid red hair was all very familiar to her.  
她走向美里，无视身后那个男人依旧盯着美里和加持的目光。当她走到他们面前时，美里发现她们现在几乎一样高了，这不知为何让一切变得清晰起来。尽管她年纪更大，但那张脸、那双蓝眼睛和那头鲜红的头发对她来说都非常熟悉。

"It's good to see you again...Misato," spoke Asuka with a wide smile.  
“再次见到你真好...美里。”明日香带着灿烂的笑容说道。

Misato couldn't do anything but hug her, feeling tears form at the corners of her eyes, so pleased to see Asuka again.  
美里除了拥抱她别无他法，感到眼角泛起泪花，再次见到明日香让她无比高兴。

Behind them, Shinji frowned, but then let out a low sigh, scratching his shaggy black hair. Well, it seemed like they knew each other, so it wasn't a problem. Besides, Shinji thought Asuka had mentioned Misato's name before, and he had a vague memory of something he had seen in the past long ago.  
在他们身后，真嗣皱了皱眉，随即发出一声低叹，挠了挠他那蓬乱的黑发。好吧，看来他们彼此认识，所以这不算问题。况且，真嗣记得明日香之前提过美里这个名字，他隐约记得很久以前似乎见过些什么。

The sergeant took all this in from the moment the newest woman, Asuka, had appeared to now. Somehow, they all knew each other, but it didn't make any sense to him. One thing he did notice, was that his body had started moving however. Slowly, he could begin to feel life returning to his arms and legs, and anger started to surge through him. He had been humiliated beyond belief, and now only wanted to cause harm to the person who had done this. His rifle was too far away to reach, but he still had the pistol at his hip.  
从最新的女人明日香出现的那一刻起，美里就一直观察着这一切。不知为何，他们似乎都互相认识，但这在他看来毫无逻辑。他注意到的一件事是，他的身体开始动起来了。慢慢地，他感觉到手臂和双腿恢复了知觉，愤怒也开始涌上心头。他感到前所未有的羞辱，现在只想对那个让他如此难堪的人进行报复。他的步枪太远了够不着，但他腰间还有一把手枪。

Sitting up suddenly, he grabbed the pistol from his waist, and pointed it at Shinji. Misato and Kaji froze, and then Asuka turned around to see this spectacle, but didn't feel any fear, and simply watched how things would play out.  
他突然坐起身，从腰间拔出手枪，指向真嗣。美里和加持僵住了，明日香转过身来看到这一幕，却并未感到恐惧，只是静静地观察事态的发展。

"You do realize that is pointless," frowned Shinji as the sergeant pointed the gun at him.  
"你难道不明白这是徒劳的吗？" 真嗣皱着眉头，当警官用枪指着他时。

"That may be so, however-"  
"或许如此，然而——"

He swung the pistol around, and pointed it at Asuka who was behind him.  
他挥动着手枪，转向身后，指向了站在他背后的明日香。

"What about now?" he asked. "Even if I can't harm you in one way, I can certainly harm you in another way."  
"那现在呢？" 他问道。"即使我不能以一种方式伤害你，我当然可以用另一种方式伤害你。"

Shinji didn't move, but he felt a seething anger beginning to develop in his chest.  
真嗣没有动，但他感到胸中开始酝酿一股愤怒。

Asuka didn't move either, even though she was being threatened. After all, she trusted Shinji.  
明日香也没有动，尽管她正受到威胁。毕竟，她信任真嗣。

"Just one false move and I'll-"  
"只要稍有差池，我就会——"

The sergeant didn't get any further: the gun was split in two as,, coming apart in his hands. A flash of orange had erupted in front of him as Shinji had effortlessly used his AT-field to disarm him. The sergeant gaped wordlessly as the weapon crumbled, not believing what had happened.  
中士话音未落，手中的枪便被一分为二，在他手中解体。一道橙光在他面前闪现，真嗣轻松地用 AT 力场将枪支拆解。中士目瞪口呆地看着武器化为碎片，难以置信所发生的一切。

Kaji felt angry as well, and took half a step forward before Asuka held out her arm to stop him.  
加持也感到愤怒，向前迈了半步，却被明日香伸出手臂拦住。

"Let Shinji deal with this," she mumbled.  
"让真嗣来处理这件事吧，"她咕哝道。

Shinji did so, walking forward towards the sergeant, all sense of forgiveness disappearing from his eyes. When he was directly in front of the sergeant who was trying to move away from him, even though his legs didn't work, he let out a heavy sigh and said-  
真嗣照做了，他向前走向那位中士，眼中所有的宽恕之意都消失了。当他直接站在试图从他身边挪开的中士面前时，尽管中士的腿并不听使唤，他还是重重地叹了口气，说道——

"I can forgive you for threatening me, because honestly, you can't do anything to me. However," and here, his eyes flashed a deadly scarlet, "it's an entirely different thing if you threaten a person I love."  
"我可以原谅你威胁我，因为老实说，你对我无可奈何。然而，"说到这里，他的眼睛闪过一丝致命的猩红，"如果你威胁到我爱的人，那就完全是另一回事了。"

A flash of orange appeared in front of Shinji, and then like a guillotine, swung down to meet the sergeant. The sergeant screamed, and then fell backwards, his head hitting the driveway as his eyes rolled upwards into his head.  
一道橙色闪光出现在真嗣面前，随即如断头台般猛地斩下，直击中士。中士尖叫一声，向后倒去，头部重重撞在车道上，双眼翻白，陷入昏迷。

Silence engulfed the area, and even the other soldiers were silent after watching this unfold.  
四周陷入一片死寂，就连其他士兵也在目睹这一幕后噤若寒蝉。

"Shinji, you didn't," Misato finally spoke.  
“真嗣，你不会真的……”美里终于开口道。

"No, I didn't kill him, just knocked him out. Though I imagine his dreams are rather unpleasant right now."  
“不，我没杀他，只是把他打晕了。不过我想他现在的梦一定相当不愉快。”

Relaxing slightly, Shinji glanced over at Asuka. She was smiling at him slightly, and then walked over to him. When there eyes met, Misato could tell that many things had happened between them, and that they were far closer now then when they were only teenagers, but she was surprised when Asuka kissed Shinji briefly. Even Kaji had his mouth agape slightly at this.  
稍微放松了一些，真嗣瞥向明日香。她正对他微微一笑，然后朝他走来。当他们的目光相遇时，美里能感觉到他们之间发生了许多事，如今他们比只是少年时亲近得多，但当明日香短暂地吻了真嗣时，她还是感到惊讶。甚至连加持都微微张大了嘴巴。

"Thanks," said Asuka. “谢谢，”明日香说道。

Shinji nodded, and then glanced back to where Misato and Kaji stood.  
真嗣点点头，然后回头看向美里和加持所在的地方。

"I suppose there are a lot of things to share, but for now we should-"  
"我想有很多事情可以分享，但眼下我们应该——"

He was about to mention what to do with the soldiers, but he was interrupted by the sound of the sliding door alongside the house opening again.  
他正要说如何处理士兵们，却被房子旁边滑动门再次打开的声音打断了。

Both Shinji and Asuka's eyes whipped over to the corner of the house, and then Asuka glanced quickly at Shinji before trotting away to where the sound had come from.  
真嗣和明日香的眼神立刻转向房子的角落，随后明日香迅速瞥了真嗣一眼，便小跑着朝声音传来的方向去了。

Misato and Kaji didn't know what to make of this, but Misato saw that Shinji's expression had turned rather stony.  
美里和加持对此不知所措，但美里注意到真嗣的表情变得相当冷硬。

Shortly, Asuka came around the corner, but she wasn't alone this time. As what came into view quickly appeared in Misato and Kaji's eyes, they both realized what they were seeing.  
不久，明日香转过拐角，但这次她并非独自一人。当视线中的景象迅速映入美里和加持的眼帘时，他们立刻明白了眼前所见。

In Asuka's arms was a small child of four years, that had shoulder length red hair and brown eyes.  
在明日香的怀中是一个四岁的小孩，有着齐肩的红发和棕色的眼睛。

Standing beside Shinji now, Asuka glanced over at him slightly worried, but the child in her arms was staring wide eyed at the soldiers lying on the ground, and Misato and Kaji who were standing several feet away from them.  
此刻站在真嗣身旁，明日香略带忧虑地瞥了他一眼，但她怀中的孩子却睁大了眼睛，盯着躺在地上的士兵，以及站在几英尺外的美里和加持。

Finally, Misato broke the silence and asked, "Shinji...Asuka...is that?"  
最终，美里打破了沉默，问道：“真嗣...明日香...那是？”

"Yes," said Asuka not looking at Misato, but now staring at the child clutched lovingly in her arms. "This is mine and Shinji's child, Alena."  
“是的，”明日香没有看向美里，而是凝视着她怀中紧紧抱着的孩子，“这是我和真嗣的孩子，阿莲娜。”

Shinji nodded wordlessly, his eyes focusing on the two people beside him, the two that he cared most about in the entire world.  
真嗣默默地点头，目光聚焦在他身边的两个人身上，这是他在整个世界上最为关心的人。

Across from them, Misato and Kaji stood motionlessly, letting this slowly sink in, but in a far corner of Misato's mind, she felt a sudden dread welling up inside her that she couldn't explain.  
在他们对面，美里和加持一动不动地站着，让这一切慢慢沉淀，但在美里心灵的某个角落，她感到一种无法解释的突然恐惧在内心涌起。

**In the words of Deckard Cain, "Stay awhile and listen!" (Cause I'm gonna ramble)  
正如迪卡德·凯恩所说，“稍待片刻，且听我言！”（因为我即将开始长篇大论）**

**First off, Welcome to those of you joining in for the first time with this chapter. For those that have stuck with me through these past few years, Welcome Back. The second part of Two of Us is just starting, and I hope everyone got a decent shock about several things from this chapter.  
首先，欢迎首次加入本章阅读的朋友们。对于那些多年来一直陪伴我的读者，欢迎回来。《我们俩》的第二部分刚刚开始，希望大家在这一章中对几件事情感到相当震惊。**

**To put this in perspective, the initial workings of this chapter first began to formulate in my mind back in 2010 when I was writing Sorrowful Winter, and for those that have read that, yes Alena is the name I used for Shinji and Asuka's daughter back then, and it's the name that I stuck with all the way to this point.  
为了让大家更好地理解，这一章最初的构思始于 2010 年，当时我正在写《悲伤的冬天》，对于读过那本书的人来说，是的，Alena 是我当时为真嗣和明日香的女儿取的名字，而且我一直沿用这个名字直到现在。**

**As I began writing this however, the more and more I began to realize the scope in which this chapter would cover, as little things started cropping up through the cracks. I initially wanted Misato to learn about the passage of the seven years from seeing Shinji and Asuka, which would have been a much greater shock, but the thing with the computers and technology that was left over didn't seem realistic to just gloss over. Maybe it had something to do with me rereading The Stand in tandem to writing parts of this, but I'll leave it at that.  
然而，随着我开始写作，我越来越意识到这一章所涵盖的范围，因为一些小事情开始从裂缝中冒出来。我最初想让美里通过看到真嗣和明日香来了解这七年的流逝，这本应是一个更大的震惊，但关于遗留下来的电脑和技术问题，似乎不太现实地一笔带过。也许这与我在写这部分时同时重读《穹顶之下》有关，但我就说到这里。**

**This chapter is long, and some may call it absurdly long, but I ended up not finding a satisfactory spot to cut it in half, and I've had the ending planned out for months, which seems proper to have it end as it does. I can honestly say that I'll never have a chapter be this long again.  
这一章很长，有人甚至会说它长得离谱，但我最终没找到一个满意的断点将其一分为二，而且我几个月前就计划好了结尾，觉得这样结束恰到好处。老实说，我以后再也不想写这么长的章节了。**

**Anyway, I'll end things here, and go to sleep since I have to work tonight.  
总之，我就此搁笔，去睡觉了，因为今晚还得上班。**

**(As a side note, this chapter was written almost entirely on my phone, and while I've proofed it several times, it's very likely that it still has some great autocorrect errors (My favorite being dome to some)).  
（顺便一提，这一章几乎全是在手机上完成的，虽然我校对过多次，但很可能还残留着一些令人捧腹的自动纠错错误（我最喜欢的例子是把'dome'错写成'some'）。）**
