Chapter 11: The Fourth and Fifth Children  
第十一章：第四与第五适格者

SEELE 01: "Ikari, the loss of the Second Child at this stage is not in favor of our scenario!"  
SEELE 01: "碇，在这个阶段失去第二适格者对我们计划不利！"

SEELE 04: "You should know that the Deas Sea Scrolls never predicted such an event; the Second Child was never meant to be an Angel or sorts. This indicates severe deviation from the scenario."  
SEELE 04: “你应该知道，《死海文书》从未预言过这样的事件；二号适格者绝非天使之流。这表明情况严重偏离了剧本。”

Ikari: "Indeed. I am aware of the situation. Dr. Akagi's reckless actions will be punished, and I will make sure the scenario proceeds as intended. We need to find a new pilot for Unit 02. Furthermore, Units 03 and 04 need pilots as well."  
碇：“确实如此。我已了解情况。赤木博士的鲁莽行为将受到惩处，我会确保剧本按计划进行。我们需要为二号机寻找新的驾驶员。此外，三号机和四号机也需要驾驶员。”

SEELE 05: "Based on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Unit 03 was meant to be taken by an Angel. I wonder who do you want to put in it?"  
SEELE 05: “根据《死海文书》，三号机本应由使徒接管。你打算让谁来驾驶它呢？”

Ikari: "I have my candidate for both Unit 02 and Unit 03. The successful execution of the scenario requires a mental breakdown of my son; thus, putting one of his friends inside Unit 03 will suffice."  
碇源堂：“我已经为二号机和三号机选定了驾驶员。为了成功执行计划，需要让我儿子精神崩溃；因此，将他的一个朋友放入三号机就足够了。”

SEELE 11: "What's the progress on the Dummy Plug system, Gendo?"  
Seele 11：“碇，Dummy Plug 系统的进展如何？”

Ikari: "Near completion. Dr. Akagi is doing final check-ups and it will be ready by the time."  
碇源堂：“接近完成。赤木博士正在进行最后的检查，届时将会准备就绪。”

SEELE 03: "But from what I've heard, it's still extremely unstable!"  
SEELE 03: \"但据我所知，它仍然极不稳定！\"

Ikari: "Irrelevant. The Dummy Plug system will suffice its purpose in the current stage."  
碇: \"无关紧要。Dummy Plug 系统在现阶段足以完成其使命。\"

SEELE 01: "The time will come. Humanity's last step towards the ultimate evolution; We will not allow any discrepancies."  
SEELE 01: \"时机终会到来。这是人类迈向终极进化的最后一步；我们不允许任何差错。\"

"Major Katsuragi, the interrogation against the litigant of this event, the Third Child, was denied by you." A voice said. The room was dark and small; the members of Human Instrumentality Committee sat around a table while Major Katsuragi stood in front of them.  
“葛城少校，关于此次事件的当事人，即第三适格者，您拒绝了他的审讯。”一个声音说道。房间昏暗而狭小；人类补完委员会的成员们围坐在一张桌子旁，而葛城少校则站在他们面前。

Those old men were apparently interested in the interactions between Angels and humans; they would never miss a chance to take a glimpse into it.  
那些老头子显然对使徒与人类之间的互动感兴趣；他们绝不会错过一窥究竟的机会。

"Yes." Misato replied, her voice clear and determined, "he's very mentally unstable; I don't think it's a good idea to interrogate him here and now." Misato knew she was lying; Shinji was acting pretty normal these days; she doubted whether it was the real normal or Shinji was broken enough not to feel anything. Nonetheless, it was her job to protect her surrogate son from any possible harm, whether it's physical or not.  
“是的。”美里回答道，她的声音清晰而坚定，“他精神状态非常不稳定；我认为现在在这里审问他不是个好主意。”美里知道自己在撒谎；真嗣最近表现得相当正常；她怀疑这是否是真正的正常，还是真嗣已经崩溃到感觉不到任何东西。尽管如此，保护她的养子免受任何可能的伤害，无论是身体上的还是其他方面的，都是她的职责。

"Then I'll ask you, Major Katsuragi." Another voice said, "Was the Angel trying to contact humans?"  
"那么，我问你，葛城少校。"另一个声音说道，"天使是在试图与人类接触吗？"

"The reports from our doctors say there was no sign of such contact," Misato replied, "We're deducing this event as fortuitous."  
"我们医生的报告称没有发现此类接触的迹象，"美里回答，"我们推断这一事件是偶然的。"

"How about his memories? If he remembered correctly…"  
"那他的记忆呢？如果他记得没错的话……"

"I don't think his memories were affected by outside factors," Misato interrupted.  
"我认为他的记忆并未受到外界因素的影响，" 美里打断道。

"But the AC recorder on the EVA had ceased functioning, how could you make sure of that?" the voice was becoming irritated, "how can we know whether the Angels were interested in human minds?"  
"但 EVA 上的 AC 记录器已经停止工作，你怎么能确定这一点？" 声音变得不耐烦，"我们怎么知道使徒是否对人类的心灵感兴趣？"

"No offense, but I can't answer that," Misato said, "I don't even know whether they have their own minds, much less understand human minds."  
"无意冒犯，但我无法回答这个问题，" 美里说，"我甚至不知道它们是否有自己的心智，更不用说理解人类的心智了。"

The members decided to change the subject since they knew they were not getting anywhere with this determined Major, "Do we know whether the twelfth Angel is related in anyways with the next one?"  
成员们决定换个话题，因为他们知道在这个固执的少校面前毫无进展，“我们是否知道第十二使徒与下一个有任何关联吗？”

The expression on Misato's face softened; the old men finally decided to give her kids a break. "Negative. From the past patterns, the Angels never showed any sign of coordination."  
美里脸上的表情缓和了；那些老头子们终于决定给她的小孩们一点喘息的机会。“否定。从过去的模式来看，使徒从未表现出任何协同迹象。”

"Right, they had been acting on their own." The voice said, "at least until now."  
“没错，他们一直各自为战。”那个声音说道，“至少到目前为止。”

Misato's body tensed a bit. What were they implying by that statement? Would Angels attack in coordination in the future? It was already hard enough to fight one Angel at a time, facing two at once? Or even more? She didn't dare to imagine how that would turn out. "May I ask… what did you mean by that?"  
美里身体微微一紧。他们那句话是什么意思？未来使徒会协同攻击吗？一次对付一个使徒已经够艰难了，同时面对两个？甚至更多？她不敢想象那会是什么结果。“我可以问一下……你们那句话是什么意思吗？”

"This is irrelevant to you. Now leave."  
“这与你无关。现在离开。”

"Hai." Misato sighed, as a Major and the Director of Operations, she was still kept in the darkness. She couldn't help but think of the Angel at the basement inside Terminal Dogma; just how many secrets did NERV have?  
“是。”美里叹了口气，作为少校和作战部长，她仍被蒙在鼓里。她不禁想起位于最终教条区地下室的使徒；NERV 究竟藏有多少秘密？

Even though Tokyo-3 had been the epicenter of Angel attacks, surprisingly, its hospital received very few visitors. Often times those who came into its care were almost guaranteed to be in the morgue by the end of the night, so if anyone did come to 'visit' it was often to  
尽管东京-3 一直是使徒袭击的中心，但令人惊讶的是，它的医院访客却非常少。通常那些被送来救治的人几乎注定会在当晚被送进太平间，所以如果有谁来‘探访’，往往是为了

I.D. the bodies of the deceased.  
辨认逝者的遗体。

Toji Suzuhara, the only visitor in Tokyo-3 Hospital, made his way down the nearly empty hall of the east wing. The nurses and Toji greeted to each other. The staff had grown to know Toji quite well  
铃原东治是东京-3 医院唯一的访客，他沿着几乎空无一人的东翼走廊前行。护士们和东治互相打招呼。工作人员已经对东治相当熟悉了

since his sister was admitted. Every day he would come to visit if he could. His kindness and generosity had not gone unnoticed by the staff. They tried their best to help his little sister; however, they could only do much due to the funding issues. His sister's conditions hadn't improved nor worsened ever since she was admitted.  
自从他妹妹被收治以来，只要有可能，他每天都来探望。他的善良和慷慨没有被工作人员忽视。他们尽最大努力帮助他的小妹妹；然而，由于资金问题，他们能做的有限。自她入院以来，她的情况既没有好转也没有恶化。

Toji sighed as he gazed at the door to her hospital room. In truth, it hurt him every time he came here. It hurt him to see her tiny little body cooped up in a bed. She was a child. She was supposed to run around and play outside in the sun, not lie down for hours on end inside of an empty white room. Although his sister was strong, she couldn't help but become more and more depressed. Taking in yet another deep breath, he placed his hand on the doorknob and turned it. Facing her was like walking into an emotional battlefield. He had to keep a cheerful faç ade for her sake, but every time he saw her now, he just wanted to breakdown and cry.  
当看着她病房的那扇门时，Toji 叹了口气。事实上，每次来这里都让他心痛。看到她小小的身体蜷缩在床上，他感到痛苦。她还是个孩子。她本应在阳光下奔跑玩耍，而不是长时间躺在空荡荡的白房间里。尽管他妹妹很坚强，但她无法不变得越来越沮丧。他再次深吸一口气，把手放在门把手上，转动它。面对她就像走进一个情感的战场。他必须为了她保持愉快的假象，但每次见到她，他只想崩溃大哭。

Toji sighed heavily, and pushed the door open.  
Toji 重重地叹了口气，推开了门。

"Oh my God." Misato gasped, placing her hand over her mouth as she looked at the sight displayed on the monitor before her. The image showed a satellite photo of what was the American NERV Branch in Nevada, or all that remained of it for that matter. It looked like nothing more than a giant crater in the earth that spanned for well over a hundred kilometers.  
“我的天啊。”美里倒抽一口气，用手捂住嘴巴，目光紧盯着眼前显示器上的景象。画面展示的是一张卫星照片，原本是美国 NERV 内华达分部的所在地，或者说，是它残存的一切。那里看起来就像是一个巨大的地坑，绵延超过一百公里。

Maya reported the details concerning the incident. They believe it was the S2 engine mounted in Unit 04 had caused such a catastrophic event. Though Misato didn't care that much about NERV's experimental technology outside of the weapons department, she had heard plenty about the S2 engine from Ritsuko, and what Dr. Akagi didn't disclose with her, Kaji filled her in on. By design it was meant to make the usage of umbilical cables obsolete. The S2 engine could theoretically power an Evangelion indefinitely, and also produce an infinite amount of energy output.  
玛雅汇报了关于此次事件的详细情况。他们认为，是安装在四号机上的 S2 引擎导致了这场灾难性的事件。虽然美里对 NERV 武器部门以外的实验技术并不太关心，但她从律子那里听说过不少关于 S2 引擎的事情，而律子没有透露的部分，加持则为她补全了。从设计初衷来看，S2 引擎旨在使脐带电缆的使用变得多余。理论上，S2 引擎能够为 EVA 提供无限动力，同时产生无限的能量输出。

"We believe that during the activation test a Dirac sea formed, one not too dissimilar from the one we encountered with the previous Angel, and sucked in the entirety of NERV's Second Branch." Dr. Akagi explained. "Though Unit 04 was completely lost in the incident, the United States military was able to extract Unit 03."  
"我们相信在激活测试期间形成了一个狄拉克之海，与之前遇到的天使所产生的那个颇为相似，并将 NERV 第二支部完全吞噬。"赤木博士解释道，"尽管 04 号机在这起事故中彻底损毁，但美国军方成功救出了 03 号机。"

"What are they going to do with Unit 03 without a NERV Branch to operate it from?" Misato crossed her arms and kept her gaze locked on the screen.  
"没有 NERV 支部来操作，他们打算怎么处理 03 号机？"美里交叉双臂，目光紧锁屏幕。

"It's going to become our problem, of course." Ritsuko handed a document to Misato, who read it carefully. It was clear that the United States wanted nothing to do with the EVAs anymore after the disaster.  
"当然，这将成为我们的问题。"律子递给美里一份文件，她仔细阅读。显然，美国在经历了那场灾难后，再也不想与 EVA 扯上任何关系。

"Wonderful." She sighed. "So now they're giving us a potentially unstable EVA Unit."  
"真棒。" 她叹了口气。"现在他们给我们一台可能不稳定的 EVA 单位。"

"Which is why its activation test will be at Matsushiro." Ritsuko said, "In that case we'll have time to react if anything goes wrong."  
"这就是为什么它的激活测试将在松代进行。" 律子说，"那样的话，如果有什么问题，我们就有时间应对了。"

"You mean you've already found a pilot for it?" Misato raised her eyes to the doctor and gave her an inquisitive stare, cocking an eyebrow.  
"你是说你已经找到它的驾驶员了？" 美里抬起眼睛看向医生，挑起眉毛，投去一个探询的目光。"

"Meet me in my office, we'll discuss it in more detail there." Akagi seemed almost dismissive of her question.  
“到我办公室来，我们详细讨论一下。”赤木似乎对她的提问有些不以为意。

"I didn't receive a notification from the Marduk Institute."  
“我没有收到玛杜克研究所的通知。”

"Like I said," Ritsuko narrowed her eyes slightly. "We'll discuss this in my office." Ritsuko said before turning back to the rest of the NERV staff, continuing her presentation on the Nevada incident. Misato shook her head as she looked back down at the document. Unit 03 and 04 were made to be a twin series, meaning that their programs and configurations were practically identical. Even if the activation test was done without using the S2 engine, the list of possibilities as  
“就像我说的，”律子微微眯起眼睛，“我们会在我办公室讨论这件事。”律子说完后转身面向 NERV 的其他员工，继续讲解内华达事件的报告。美里摇了摇头，再次低头看向文件。零三号和零四号机原本是作为双胞胎系列制造的，这意味着它们的程序和配置几乎完全相同。即便激活测试没有使用 S2 引擎，可能性的清单依然……

to what could go wrong was endless. Also the sudden discovery of the Fourth and Fifth Children didn't sit right with her either.  
可能出错的事情是无穷无尽的。此外，第四和第五适格者的突然发现也让她感到不安。

After a brief trip through the elevator and a few turns they found themselves in her rather small office. Even though she was the head scientist at NERV, it was a bit surprising that her office was so small.  
经过电梯的短暂旅程和几次转弯后，他们来到了她相当狭小的办公室。尽管她是 NERV 的首席科学家，但她的办公室如此之小还是有点出乎意料。

"So why wasn't I informed that we found the Fourth and Fifth Children?" Misato couldn't even wait for the automatic door to shut all the way before asking.  
“为什么我没有被告知我们找到了第四和第五适格者？”Misato 甚至在自动门完全关闭之前就迫不及待地问道。

"You will receive all the necessary paperwork in due time, Major Katsuragi." She replied, taking a seat at her desk. "All you need to know is that we have cores ready for them, and they will pilot Unit 02 and Unit 03."  
"您将在适当的时候收到所有必要的文件，葛城少校。" 她回答道，坐在办公桌前。"您需要知道的是，我们已经准备好了核心，他们将驾驶二号机和三号机。"

"Well can you at least tell me who the pilots are?" She had always hated the phrase 'all you need to know.' She had been kept in the dark for so long.  
"那么，你至少能告诉我飞行员是谁吗？" 她一直讨厌那句'你只需要知道'的话。她已经被蒙在鼓里太久了。"

"Of course." The blonde made a few rapid keystrokes, causing a new screen to come up. As soon as Misato laid her eyes upon the visage, they grew wide with shock.  
"当然可以。" 金发女子迅速敲击了几下键盘，一个新的屏幕随之出现。当美里一看到那张面孔，她的眼睛便因震惊而睁大了。"

"Them?!" She grabbed the back of Ritsuko's chair and brought her face closer to the monitor, unable to believe who she was looking at. "They are the Fourth and Fifth Children?!"  
"他们？！" 她抓住了律子椅子的后背，将脸贴近显示器，无法相信自己看到的是谁。"他们就是第四和第五适格者？！"

"Indeed." Dr. Akagi wasn't fazed at all. "They're in Shinji's class though. How is it that he of all people…" Ritsuko cut her off. "All of the students in Class 2-A are potential candidates for becoming EVA pilots. We thought it was best to keep them grouped together like this for the sake of ease."  
"确实如此。" 赤城博士丝毫不为所动。"不过他们在真嗣的班上。怎么偏偏是他……" 律子打断了她。"2-A 班的所有学生都是潜在的 EVA 驾驶员人选。我们认为最好让他们这样集中在一起，便于管理。"

"I can't believe this." The lavender-haired woman shook her head. "I don't know how Shinji would take it. We've already caused him so much pain, and now with Asuka gone, I just don't know…"  
"我真不敢相信。" 那位紫发女子摇了摇头。"我不知道真嗣会怎么接受这件事。我们已经给他带来了太多痛苦，现在明日香又不在了，我真的不知道……"

"I can't help it. Shinji just has to deal with this. We need these children to fight for humanity, and remember, no one forced them  
"我也没办法。真嗣只能面对这个现实。我们需要这些孩子为人类而战，记住，没有人强迫他们"

into piloting the Evangelions; they must do it on their free will."  
"驾驶 EVA；他们必须出于自愿。"

Seeing no more arguments coming from the Major, Ritsuko continued, "I'll be having a meeting with the Fourth and Fifth Children tomorrow. And the activation test is slated to be held three days from now."  
"看到少校不再争论，律子继续说，“我明天将与第四和第五适格者会面。而启动测试定于三天后进行。”"

"Understood." Misato sighed, lowering her head.  
“明白了。”美里叹了口气，低下头。

It's another normal day in Tokyo-3 First Municipal Junior High School.  
这是东京-3 第一市立中学又一个平常的日子。

"Toji, Suzuhara and Hikari, Horaki please report to the principal's office." The loud speaker echoed throughout the school just after the lunch bell rang. The entire class of 2-A threw their eyes their way, as if to ask them why he was being called there. The lanky teenager merely shrugged at them, knowing just as much as they did about this unexpected summoning. Hikari on the other hand, simply complied the request and left, of course dragging her boyfriend along with her. Though Toji didn't mind being the center of attention, he couldn't help but feel a little bit awkward with all these eyes watching him. Feeling uncomfortable about it all, he quickly made his way out of the door and into the hall, leaving the stares behind.  
“铃原东治、洞木光，请到校长办公室报到。”午餐铃声刚响，广播就在校园内回荡。2-A 班的全体同学都把目光投向他们，仿佛在问他们为什么被叫去。高个子的少年只是耸了耸肩，对这次突如其来的召唤和他们一样一无所知。而洞木光则顺从地接受了请求并离开，当然也拖着她的男朋友一起。虽然东治并不介意成为焦点，但被这么多目光注视着，他不禁感到有些尴尬。感到不自在的他，迅速走出教室，进入走廊，把那些目光抛在身后。

"You called us, Mr. Shimamoto?" Toji asked as he opened the door to the principal's office just next to the front lobby.  
“您叫我们来的，岛本先生？” 东治一边问，一边推开靠近前厅的校长办公室的门。

"Hello, Mr. Suzuhara, Hello, Ms. Horaki." The person sitting at the elderly principle's desk was not Mr. Shimamoto, but instead a lady he had never seen before in his life. She was a young woman, with attractive features and what Toji could only assume was dyed blonde hair, judging by her roots and brown eyebrows. Though she was admittedly pretty, he couldn't help but feel a daunting aura radiating from her. "Um," His eyes traced to his left and right, looking for the older gentleman that was the principal of the school. "Where is Mr.  
“你好，铃原同学，你好，洞木同学。”坐在老校长办公桌后的人不是岛本先生，而是一个他从未见过的女士。她是一位年轻女子，有着吸引人的外貌，以及东治只能猜测是染成金色的头发，从她的发根和棕色眉毛来看。尽管她确实漂亮，但他不禁感觉到一种令人畏惧的气场从她身上散发出来。“呃，”他的目光左右扫视，寻找着那位学校的校长老先生。“岛本先生在哪里？”

Shima-"

"Mr. Shimamoto isn't the one who called you." She pulled her hand out from behind the desk and extended it. "I did." Her tone seemed warm, but something about it didn't quite sit right with Toji as he extended his hand to shake hers. Hikari shook her hands as well, standing nervously beside Toji. "My name is Doctor Ritsuko Akagi. I work for NERV. It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Suzuhara and Ms. Horaki."  
“岛本先生不是叫你们来的人。”她从桌后伸出一只手。“是我。”她的语气看似热情，但不知为何让东治感到有些不对劲，他伸出手与她握手。光也跟着握手，紧张地站在东治旁边。“我叫赤木律子博士。我在 NERV 工作。很高兴见到你们，铃原同学和洞木同学。”

"It's nice to meet you too." Toji acted a bit more reserved than normal, not quite sure what was going on. "Is this about Shinji or Asuka? Haven't seen the Red Devil for weeks…"  
"也很高兴见到你。" 冬二表现得比平时更为拘谨，不太确定发生了什么。"这是关于真嗣还是明日香的事？已经好几个星期没见到红发恶魔了……"

"Yeah, could you tell us what's been going on? Is she okay?" Hikari followed, her tone concerning. It's been a long time since she had ever heard anything from her best friend; not even Shinji told her anything about Asuka. However, judging from Shinji's seemingly happy mental state recently, she was sure Asuka must've been okay.  
"是的，你能告诉我们发生了什么吗？她还好吗？" 光子紧随其后，语气中带着关切。她已经很久没有从她最好的朋友那里听到任何消息了；就连真嗣也没有告诉她关于明日香的任何事情。然而，从真嗣最近看似愉快的心理状态来看，她确信明日香一定没事。

"That's not our concern right now." She shook her head. "On the contrary, this is about you guys."  
"这现在不是我们该关心的。" 她摇了摇头。"相反，这是关于你们的事。"

"Us?" Toji pointed to himself and Hikari, making a perplexed look. Surely it couldn't be that NERV wanted them to break up, right?  
"我们？" 冬二指着自己和光，脸上露出困惑的表情。总不会是 NERV 想让他们分手吧，对吧？

"Why don't you just go ahead and take a seat? We have a lot to talk about." Ritsuko pointed to a pair of chairs on the opposite side of the large wooden desk.  
"你为什么不先坐下呢？我们有很多要谈的。" 律子指着大木桌对面的一对椅子说道。

"What is all this about?" He asked, crossing his arms, forming a shield of sorts between him and Dr. Akagi.  
"这都是怎么回事？" 他问道，交叉双臂，仿佛在自身与赤城博士之间筑起了一道屏障。

"I'm going to be quite frank with you guys." Akagi clasped her hands together on the desk, and leaned back in her chair. "Toji, You have been selected as a potential recruit for Evangelion Unit 03. Hikari, you are selected as the pilot of Unit 02. Are you at all interested?"  
"我打算对你们坦率直言。" 赤木双手合十放在桌上，靠回椅背。"冬二，你被选为 EVA 初号机 03 的潜在驾驶员。光，你被选为 02 机的驾驶员。你们有兴趣吗？"

Suzuhara went wide eyed for a moment, but then straightened up his expression. "Sorry, but no way." He shook his head. "I've been inside  
铃原一时瞪大了眼睛，随即恢复了表情。"抱歉，绝对不行。"他摇摇头。"我曾进入过那种东西，一次就够了。而且我绝不会让光也卷进来。"

one of those things before, and that was one time too many. And there's no way Im letting Hikari into this as well."  
那种东西，一次就够我受的了。而且我绝不会让光也卷进来。"

Hikari, on the other hand, had noticed something else. "Wait… Isn't Unit 02 Asuka's Unit? Why am I being selected to pilot it? How about Asuka?"  
另一方面，光却注意到了别的事情。“等等……02 号机不是明日香的专用机吗？为什么选我驾驶？明日香怎么办？”

Ritsuko frowned faintly, letting out a sigh. "Pilot Soryu's… in a complicated condition. She's out of the roster for now. And Toji, you have a sister called Sakura, right?"  
律子微微皱眉，叹了口气。“惣流驾驶员……目前情况复杂，她暂时不在名单上。而你，东治，你有个妹妹叫樱花，对吧？”

Toji felt himself jump back in his chair upon hearing the name. "H..how do you know about her?"  
听到这个名字，东治感觉自己差点从椅子上跳起来。“你……你怎么知道她的？”

"NERV keeps tabs on all of its potential pilot candidates. Including their families." She explained, throwing a knowing look at the boy. "We also are well aware of your sister's current condition."  
"NERV 对所有潜在的驾驶员候选人及其家庭都保持着密切关注。" 她解释道，向男孩投去一个意味深长的眼神。"我们也十分清楚你妹妹目前的状况。"

"Leave her out of this!" He stood up, causing Ritsuko to blink, but not flinch.  
"别把她牵扯进来！" 他站起身来，让 Ritsuko 眨了眨眼，但并未退缩。"

"Mr. Suzuhara," Akagi closed her eyes and kept a calm tone, raising her clasped hands from the table to just over her mouth before opening her eyes again. "we at NERV are well aware that the hospital she's located at is not exactly the best medical facility in the world She's been in the care of Tokyo-3 Hospital for months now and is showing no real signs of recovery. We can fix that, however."  
"铃原先生，" 赤木律子闭上眼睛，保持平静的语气，将双手从桌子上抬起，放在嘴边，然后再次睁开眼睛。"我们 NERV 非常清楚她所在的医院并非世界上最好的医疗机构。她在东京-3 医院接受治疗已经数月，至今未见明显好转。不过，我们能够解决这个问题。"

Toji narrowed his eyes. "I'm listening."

"NERV has the best medical care facilities in the world. However, they are only available to NERV personnel and their families. Seeing as how you share no direct relation with anyone currently working at NERV, this makes us unable to accept Sakura into our care." Her eyes started to narrow just a little. "However, if you choose to become the pilot of Unit 03, then we can accept Sakura into our care, where she will receive the best medical treatment not even money can buy."  
"NERV 拥有世界上最先进的医疗设施。然而，这些设施仅对 NERV 员工及其家属开放。鉴于你与目前任何在 NERV 工作的人员无直接关系，我们无法接受樱进入我们的护理。" 她的眼睛微微眯起。"不过，如果你选择成为 03 号机驾驶员，那么我们就可以接受樱，让她接受连金钱都无法购买的顶级医疗治疗。"

He fell back in his seat, and crossed his arms again. "You promise that she'll be taken care of?"  
他向后靠在椅背上，再次交叉双臂。"你保证她会得到照顾吗？"

"Of course." Ritsuko smiled underneath her hands. She knew she had him on the hook. "You promise that even if something happens to me, you guys will keep treating her?"  
"当然。" 律子在手底下微笑着。她知道他已经上钩了。"你保证即使我出了什么事，你们也会继续治疗她吗？"

"Any direct family to NERV personnel is always welcome at our medical facilities." She wasn't lying.  
"任何 NERV 人员的直系亲属在我们医疗机构总是受欢迎的。" 她没有说谎。

"Fine." He nodded. "I'll do it. But there's no way Im letting Hikari into this."  
"好吧。" 他点头道，"我会做的。但无论如何我都不会让 Hikari 卷入这件事。"

"Toji…" Hikari said, her voice soft but determined, "If you're going to this, then Im in as well. We'll look after each other, right? I'm not letting you fight without me!"  
"Toji…" Hikari 说，她的声音柔和却坚定，"如果你要去，那我也去。我们会互相照顾，对吧？我不会让你独自面对的！"

Toji looked into her eyes, "Hikari… you don't know how scary those things could be… last time I was in Shinji's EVA, that was not pleasant experience…"  
冬二凝视着她的眼睛，“光…你不知道那些东西有多可怕…上次我坐在真嗣的 EVA 里，那可不是什么愉快的经历…”

"But… I'm sure Shinji and Rei will protect us, right?" Hikari said, "and Asuka… well, I don't know what happened to her, but I'm sure she'll support me as well. There's no need to argue, Toji. If you go, I'll come with you."  
“但是…我相信真嗣和绫波会保护我们的，对吧？”光说，“还有明日香…虽然我不知道她发生了什么，但我相信她也会支持我的。没必要争论，冬二。如果你去，我会跟你一起去。”

"But…" Toji trailed off and paused for a few seconds. He looked up into the ceiling, closing his eyes. Sighing heavily, he looked back at Hikari, "Fine. Remember Hikari, I will protect you, no matter what." Hikari just smiled in return.  
“但是…”冬二欲言又止，停顿了几秒。他抬头望向天花板，闭上眼睛。重重地叹了口气，他再次看向光，“好吧。记住，光，无论发生什么，我都会保护你。”光只是回以微笑。

"Good." Ritsuko said, pulling out an inch thick stack of papers from under the desk. "We'll need for you to sign this." Ritsuko thumbed through the pages, reaching the last one, and presented it to the couple. At the bottom of a wall of text, were blank lines. One for their signatures, the other for the date. As Ritsuko handed Toji a pen, he started to have a weary feeling about all this. However he didn't care what NERV did with him. He just wanted Sakura to get better, and  
“好。” 律子说着，从桌下抽出一叠约一英寸厚的文件。“需要你们在这上面签字。” 律子翻阅着文件，翻到最后一页，递给了这对夫妇。在一长串文字的底部，留有空白行。一处供他们签名，另一处填写日期。律子递给阿薰一支笔，他开始对这一切感到疲惫。然而他并不在乎 NERV 会对他做什么，他只希望樱花能好起来，而

they could do that, so he signed right on the dotted line. Then he handed the pen to Hikari, who accepted with a shivering hand. She signed her name as well. All she cared about was to be there with Toji.  
他们能做到这一点，所以他毫不犹豫地在虚线上签了名。随后他将笔递给光，她颤抖着手接过。她也签上了自己的名字。她所关心的只是能和阿薰在一起。

"Tadaima." Shinji entered the apartment, shaking off his shoes. Walking into the living room, he was taken aback to see Asuka sitting on the couch. "Wha-what are you doing here, Asuka? Misato could come home any moment!"  
“我回来了。” 真嗣走进公寓，抖掉鞋子。走进客厅，他惊讶地看到明日香坐在沙发上。“你——你在这里做什么，明日香？美里随时可能回家！”

"Relax, Baka." Asuka said, her facial expression serious, "She won't come back yet; I want to use this time to talk about a few things.  
"“放松，笨蛋。”明日香表情严肃地说，“她还没那么快回来；我想趁这个时间谈几件事。”

Now sit down."

Shinji complied and sat next to her. He took hold of her hand, and Asuka squeezed back to reassure him. "Shinji, I have an idea about how to deal with the next Angel. I plan to go in the entry plug of Unit 03 and extract whoever will be there, then you can kick its ass without holding back!" She paused for a few seconds, waiting for Shinji to say something. Her plan was very bold, and she didn't know whether it would work. But she felt she had to try.  
真嗣顺从地坐在她旁边。他握住她的手，明日香也紧握回去以示安慰。“真嗣，我有个对付下一个使徒的计划。我打算进入 03 号机的插入栓，把里面的人救出来，然后你就可以毫无顾忌地痛扁它了！”她停顿了几秒，等待真嗣的回应。她的计划非常大胆，她也不确定是否可行。但她觉得必须一试。

Shinji thought about this for a while, "Asuka… you don't need to do this… this is so dangerous! What if the Angel trapped you as well? I couldn't fight with both of you in there!" Although Shinji care about Toji since he was his friend, but Asuka was apparently more important to him. He could fight Unit 03 and extract the plug with Toji being in it; he knew Toji could take mild injuries. However, if it's Asuka in it, he wouldn't want to even touch Unit 03's skin. The image of Asuka screaming in pain was enough to paralyze him while fighting.  
真嗣思考了一会儿，“明日香…你不必这么做…这太危险了！万一使徒也把你困住了怎么办？我不能同时救你们两个！”虽然真嗣关心作为朋友的冬二，但明日香对他显然更为重要。他可以与 03 号机战斗并救出插在里面的冬二；他知道冬二能承受轻微的伤。然而，如果是明日香在里面，他甚至不想触碰 03 号机的表皮。明日香痛苦尖叫的画面足以让他战斗时动弹不得。

"Hmph, do you not believe me? There's nothing that stops the great Asuka Langley Soryu!" Asuka cheered.  
"哼，你不相信我吗？没有什么能阻挡伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！" 明日香欢呼道。

Shinji made a weak smile, "But… what if you…"  
真嗣露出了一个虚弱的微笑，"但是…如果你…"

"Shut up! I promise you I won't!" Asuka snapped at him, "It's just some stupid Angel! At worst, I could always escape easily." Asuka quickly planted a kiss on Shinji's cheek, "Just… make sure no one else gets hurt, okay?"  
"闭嘴！我向你保证我不会的！" 明日香对他厉声说道，"只是个愚蠢的天使！最坏的情况，我总能轻易逃脱。" 明日香迅速在真嗣的脸颊上亲了一下，"只是…确保其他人不会受伤，好吗？"

"O-okay… I believe you, Asuka." Shinji sighed, "Please… please come back safe."  
"好…好的…我相信你，明日香。" 真嗣叹了口气，"请…请平安归来。"

Misato came back to her apartment late at night. She was surprised to see Shinji was still up watching TV, but his eyes were unfocused. Clearly his mind was on something else. She didn't even get any type of acknowledgment of her entering the apartment from him, and that worried her. "Shinji. Shinji!" She raised her volume, which finally got his attention. "Uh… Ah! Hello! Misato-san."  
美里深夜回到公寓。她惊讶地发现真嗣还在看电视，但眼神涣散。显然他的心思在别处。她甚至没有得到他对自己进门的任何反应，这让她担心。"真嗣。真嗣！"她提高了音量，终于引起了他的注意。"呃…啊！你好！美里小姐。"

"Shinji, I'll go to Matsushiro for a business trip for a few days. I'll let Kaji look after you. Hmmm… what's on your mind?" Misato asked, wanting to know why Shinji's been lost in his mind; she was afraid that it was about Asuka, since she had some big news concerning her today.  
"真嗣，我要去松代出差几天。我会让加持照顾你。嗯…你在想什么呢？" 美里问道，想知道真嗣为何心不在焉；她担心这与明日香有关，因为她今天得知了一些关于她的重大消息。

"Uh… nothing." He lied. His mind was still worrying about Asuka's bold plan against the next Angel. He had no idea about what might happen.  
"呃…没什么。" 他撒了谎。他的脑海中仍在担忧明日香对抗下一个使徒的大胆计划。他完全不知道可能会发生什么。

"You're not good at lying, Shinji." Misato sighed, "Tell me about it."  
"你不太擅长撒谎，真嗣。" 美里叹了口气，"告诉我吧。"

Shinji sighed as well; he knew he was not getting out of this. He quickly came up with an idea, though. "Hmmm… it's about Toji. He was selected as the Fourth Child, wasn't he?"  
真嗣也叹了口气；他知道自己逃不过这一关。不过，他迅速想出了一个主意。"嗯…是关于剑介的。他被选为第四适格者了，对吧？"

Misato blinked. She didn't know how Shinji got to know the news; maybe Toji told him? But if that's the case, why didn't Toji tell him about Hikari as well? But it was not important at that time. "Uh… yeah. He told you, didn't he?" Seeing Shinji nodded, she took a deep breath, "Shinji… they found another pilot for Unit 02. The Fifth Child."  
美里眨了眨眼。她不知道真嗣是怎么得知这个消息的；也许是东治告诉他的？但如果那样的话，为什么东治没有告诉他关于光的事呢？但当时这并不重要。“呃…是的。他告诉你了，对吧？”看到真嗣点头，她深吸了一口气，“真嗣…他们找到了另一个驾驶员来驾驶二号机。第五适格者。”

Shinji's eyes twitched, taking aback by the information. This was not something old; he had never anticipated anything like this to happen. But it made sense, didn't it? After all, NERV wouldn't want a perfectly functioning EVA Unit to be wasted. "But, isn't Unit 02 Asuka's EVA?  
真嗣的眼睛抽搐了一下，被这个消息震惊了。这不是什么旧闻；他从未预料到会发生这样的事。但这说得通，不是吗？毕竟，NERV 不会希望一个功能完好的 EVA 机体被浪费。“但是，二号机不是明日香的 EVA 吗？”

How will a new pilot be able to sync with it? And who is this new pilot, anyway?"  
新驾驶员怎么能与它同步？而且这个新驾驶员是谁？

"The Fifth Child is… Hikari." Shinji gasped hearing this. "They are going adjust Unit 02's core profile to match her, so that she could sync with it properly."  
"第五个孩子是……光。" 真嗣听到这话时倒吸了一口气。"他们将调整 02 号机的核心配置以匹配她，以便她能正确同步。"

Shinji didn't know what to think. Now they had two people to protect. No, three, counting Asuka. He had to make sure Toji and Asuka could get out safe, and if not, he had to fight Unit 03, knowing the people he cared would be hurt, as well as Hikari would be mad and hurt if anything happens to her precious boyfriend, not to mention he also had to prevent Hikari from being hurt physically by the Angel controlled Unit 03. She's new to both EVA and combat, after all.  
真嗣不知道该怎么想。现在他们有两个需要保护的人。不，算上明日香，是三个。他必须确保剑介和明日香能安全撤离，如果不行，他得对抗 03 号机，明知他所关心的人会受伤，而且如果光珍视的男友有什么不测，她会既生气又伤心，更不用说他还得防止光被受使徒控制的 03 号机物理伤害。毕竟，她对 EVA 和战斗都还陌生。

Suddenly the weight on his shoulders seemed to double, and he became extremely mentally exhausted. He really needed a goodnight's sleep.  
突然间，他肩上的重担似乎翻倍了，精神极度疲惫。他真的需要好好睡一觉。

Toji stood in the observation room, looking at Unit 02 nervously. Today Hikari would have her first activation test inside Unit 02. He couldn't help but feel bad about Asuka; he knew that she would go ballistic about anyone who dared to touch her precious Unit 02, even if it's her best friend. Asuka was nowhere to be seen, though, which means they were good for now.  
冬二站在观察室里，紧张地看着二号机。今天光会在二号机内进行首次启动测试。他不禁为明日香感到难过；他知道她会因为任何人胆敢触碰她珍贵的二号机而暴跳如雷，即使那人是她最好的朋友。不过，明日香此刻并不在场，这意味着他们暂时安全。

Hikari had just walked out of the changing room. Her plug suit was not as fancy as Asuka's; it was a simple white and blue one, much like Rei's plug suit. It didn't help her plug suit to be less revealing, though. They both blushed as soon as Toji put his eye on Hikari's plug suit-wrapped body. Hikari quickly walked to the docking deck and got in the entry plug after some final exchange of reassuring  
光刚刚走出更衣室。她的插入栓服不如明日香的华丽；它是一件简单的蓝白色服装，很像零的插入栓服。尽管如此，这并没有让她的插入栓服显得不那么暴露。当冬二一看到光被插入栓服包裹的身体时，两人都脸红了。光迅速走向对接甲板，在与冬二进行了最后的安慰交流后，进入了插入栓。

words with Toji. 与冬二交换了几句鼓励的话。

"Insert Entry Plug. Entry Plug inserted. Commence Entry Plug LCL injection. LCL filled. Establishing A10 connections. A-10 connections established and stable. All circuits are operational. Absolute Borderline passed. Stable synchronization established… sync rate holding steady at Thirty-six percent." Maya reported, a smile appearing on her face. "Evangelion Unit 02 activated."  
"插入插入栓。插入栓已插入。开始注入插入栓 LCL。LCL 已充满。建立 A10 连接。A-10 连接已建立并稳定。所有电路正常运行。绝对领域已通过。稳定同步已建立…同步率保持在百分之三十六。" 真希报告道，脸上露出了微笑。"初号机 02 已启动。"

"How do you feel, Hikari?" Ritsuko asked into the comms. "It feels… warm," Hikari replied, "I feel very comfortable."  
"你感觉如何，光？" 律子通过通讯问道。"感觉…温暖，" 光回答，"我感觉非常舒适。"

"Good. Your sync rate is above the threshold." Ritsuko said, "You can try to move around a little. Just think about how you would move your fingers without actually moving them, and the EVA will move."  
"很好。你的同步率超过了阈值。" 律子说，"你可以尝试稍微活动一下。只要想象你如何不动手指地移动它们，EVA 就会随之移动。"

And Hikari just did that. She concentrated her mind on moving her fingers. Suddenly Unit 02's fingers twitched a little. "Great! Now we'll give you some time to familiarize yourself with the controls."  
而光就那样做了。她集中精神，试图移动手指。突然，零二号机的手指微微颤动了一下。“太好了！现在给你一些时间熟悉控制。”

1 hour later, Hikari could finally perform some basic movements with ease. "We'll call it today," Ritsuko said. "Cut the connections and eject the entry plug."  
一小时后，光终于能够轻松地进行一些基本动作了。“今天就到这里吧，”律子说道，“切断连接并弹出插入栓。”

Hikari felt the entry plug went cold, and her connection with the EVA was cut off. The LCL drained and she exited the entry plug after the door opened. Hikari went directly to Toji, who smiled widely at her. "It's not that scary, after all." She said to Toji, "I'm sure you'll do just right."  
光感觉到插入栓变得冰冷，她与 EVA 的连接被切断了。LCL 被排空，门打开后她离开了插入栓。光直接走向了真嗣，他向她露出了灿烂的笑容。“其实也没那么可怕。”她对真嗣说，“我相信你也能做得很好。”

"You did great there." Toji replied, his smile just grew wider, "I wonder how the Red Devil will react to the news that you'll have her Unit 02 from now on…"  
"你做得很好。" 冬二回答道，他的笑容愈发灿烂，"我想知道红魔听到从现在起你将拥有她的二号机后会有什么反应……"

Hikari had just realized the situation. "Oh… you're right. She was very possessive about her stuff. Even Shinji." Hikari sighed, "But I wonder where she is? I was actually expecting her to come to my activation test, since it was her EVA after all."  
光终于意识到了情况。"哦……你说得对。她对自己的东西非常执着。哪怕是真嗣。" 光叹了口气，"但我不知道她在哪里？我本以为她会来参加我的启动测试，毕竟那是她的 EVA。"

"No one tells us a thing," Toji said, irritated, "I mean, where could she go? She's not showing up at school, not at NERV… that leaves only her apartment!"  
"没人告诉我们任何事，" 冬二恼火地说，"我是说，她能去哪儿？她没来学校，也没在 NERV……那就只剩下她的公寓了！"

"Shinji's not here today as well… maybe he's with Asuka today."  
"今天真嗣也不在啊……也许他和明日香在一起吧。"

"Man… they'ren't doin anything indecent, are they?" Toji smirked, which made Hikari giggle, "Toji! Don't say something like that!"  
"哎呀……他们不会在做些不雅的事吧？" 阿斯兰笑着说，这让光子咯咯笑了起来，"阿斯兰！别这么说！"

"ACHOO!" Shinji sneezed; he turned his head around just in time to avoid sneeze right into Asuka's face, who was making unhappy groans since their making out was broken. "What was that about?" Asuka asked. "I don't know." Shinji said, "It came so suddenly." Without more words, they continued making out on the couch.  
"阿嚏！" 真嗣打了个喷嚏；他及时转过头，避免了把喷嚏打在明日香的脸上，明日香因为亲热被打断而不满地嘟囔着。"怎么回事？" 明日香问。"我不知道。" 真嗣说，"来得太突然了。" 没再多说，他们继续在沙发上亲热。

Shinji laid in his futon with Kaji next to him. He was thankful that Asuka had taken the news of Hikari piloting Unit 02 well; she said she knew NERV would eventually find another pilot for Unit 02, and the only person she would allow for piloting Unit 02 was Hikari.  
真嗣躺在他的蒲团上，旁边是加持。他很感激明日香对光驾驶二号机这件事的反应良好；她说她知道 NERV 最终会为二号机找到另一个驾驶员，而她唯一允许驾驶二号机的人就是光。

Except for Shinji of course. Turning around to look at Kaji, Shinji felt he should say something to this unshaved triple spy; he knew this person was important to Asuka, and he didn't want to see Asuka hurt ever again. "Kaji-san… are you awake?"  
当然，除了真嗣之外。转过身来看着加持，真嗣觉得他应该对这个未刮胡子的三重间谍说些什么；他知道这个人对明日香很重要，而他再也不想看到明日香受伤了。“加持先生…你醒着吗？”

"Yo, kiddo. Got something on your mind?" Kaji replied, his eyes  
“哟，小子。有什么心事吗？”加持回答道，他的眼睛

focusing on the ceiling.

"Yes, Kaji-san…" Shinji had to think about somewhere to start that wouldn't sound so suspicious. He knew very well about the perceptiveness of the triple spy; any slip of words would definitely raise unwanted suspicion. "I wonder… what's my father's job?"  
"是的，加持先生……" 真嗣不得不考虑一个听起来不那么可疑的开场白。他非常清楚这位三重间谍的敏锐洞察力；任何言语上的疏漏都必然会引起不必要的怀疑。"我在想……我父亲的工作到底是什么？"

"Well, your father's commander of NERV, didn't you already know that?" Kaji answered, sounding confused.  
"嗯，你父亲是 NERV 的指挥官，你不是早就知道了吗？" 加持回答道，听起来有些困惑。

"Yeah, but I feel there's more he's up to."  
"是的，但我感觉他还有更多的事情瞒着。"

Kaji blinked. 'This kid is really perceptive,' he thought, 'I wonder whether I should tell him about SEELE? Probably not, it's a risk to him to just know this information.' "Really, that's all he does."  
加持眨了眨眼。‘这孩子真是敏锐，’他心想，‘我该不该告诉他关于 SEELE 的事呢？可能还是不说为妙，光是知道这些信息对他来说就是个风险。’“真的，他就只是这样。”

"Don't lie to me, Kaji-san." Shinji said, adding more force into his tone, "I know he has something big planned."  
“别骗我，加持先生。”真嗣加重了语气，“我知道他有大事在谋划。”

Kaji sighed. He had no idea why this kid was so insisted, nor where he got the feeling. He decided to give him a warning, hoping to scare off the kid. "Shinji, I'll be honest with you. You're getting to dangerous intel. These informa…"  
加持叹了口气。他不知道这孩子为何如此坚持，也不知道他是从哪里感觉到这些的。他决定给他一个警告，希望能吓退他。“真嗣，我跟你说实话。你正在接触危险情报。这些信息…”

"Not as dangerous as what you're doing, right Kaji-san?" Shinji was growing tired with this game. He carefully assessed the situation; surely he could trust Kaji to keep his secret, at least the time travel part, knowing the type of person Kaji was. Seeing Kaji's body tense up, he decided to have a go. "Kaji-san… I know a lot of things that I probably shouldn't know, like your job, and… SEELE… my father's plan…"  
"没有你做的事情危险吧，加治先生？" 真嗣对这场游戏感到越来越厌倦。他仔细评估了情况；当然，他可以信任加治保守他的秘密，至少是关于时间旅行那部分，毕竟他了解加治的为人。看到加治的身体紧绷起来，他决定试一试。"加治先生……我知道很多我本不该知道的事情，比如你的工作，还有……SEELE……我父亲的计划……"

Kaji couldn't believe what he thought he had heard. He wasn't sure whether he should just silence Shinji right now, or listen to what he was to say. Hell, maybe he could even get some intel from Shinji. "Shinji… where do you get all of this information?" He said in a dangerously low tone.  
加治不敢相信自己似乎听到了什么。他不确定是应该现在就让真嗣闭嘴，还是听听他要说什么。见鬼，也许他还能从真嗣那里得到一些情报。"真嗣……你从哪里得到这些信息的？"他用一种危险而低沉的语气说道。

Shinji sighed, "I… I can't tell you, yet. But you can ask me questions."  
真嗣叹了口气，"我……我现在还不能告诉你。但你可以问我问题。"

Kaji weighted his choices, and decided to continue talking. "Aight… I don't know how you know all these, but Im warning you, these intel could get you killed." Sighing, he thought about what questions he should ask. Suddenly an idea came to his mind. "If you know whether Asuka…"  
加治权衡了一下选择，决定继续说下去。“好吧……我不知道你是怎么知道这些的，但我警告你，这些情报可能会让你丧命。”他叹了口气，思考着该问些什么问题。突然，一个念头闪过他的脑海。“如果你知道明日香……”

This time it was Shinji who tensed up, hard. "K-k-k-Kaji-san, where did that come from?" Shinji interrupted, "we all know…"  
这次是真嗣紧张起来，非常紧张。“加-加-加治先生，这从何说起？”真嗣打断道，“我们都知道……”

"Shinji, I need you to be honest with me," Kaji said, "as impossible as it seems, our satellite picked up someone very similar to her in France days ago. I've got no idea how she got there, or she's still alive, but I feel this is something you'd know."  
“真嗣，我需要你对我诚实，”加治说，“尽管这听起来不可能，但我们的卫星几天前在法国捕捉到了一个与她极为相似的人。我不知道她是怎么到那里的，或者她还活着，但我觉得你应该知道些什么。”

Shinji sighed heavily. He cursed internally about Asuka's carelessness, but what's done was done, and there's no running away from it anymore. His original plan seemed to backfire on him; he could do nothing but fall into the trap he set up for Kaji. "Yeah… she's alive…"  
真嗣重重地叹了口气。他内心咒骂着明日香的大意，但事已至此，再也无法逃避。他原本的计划似乎适得其反；他只能落入自己为加持设下的陷阱。“是啊……她还活着……”

Kaji left out a relieved exhale, feeling a huge weight had been lifted up from his shoulders. Although he never had any romantic feelings toward Asuka, he had always cared for her almost as his own daughter, although she could be annoying sometimes. He was listless when he heard that she was dead, and he'd been so sad for days. Now hearing that Asuka's actually alive, although it sounded implausible, especially it's Shinji who said it, he still felt relieved more than ever. He wasn't sure why he believed Shinji, but he just felt he was telling the truth. "That's good to hear… Shinji." He still wanted to know how did Shinji know, "but how do you know? I mean, she's in France, how'd you communicate?"  
加持松了一口气，感到肩上的重担卸下了。尽管他对明日香从未有过浪漫情感，但他一直像对待自己的女儿一样关心她，尽管她有时很烦人。当得知她去世的消息时，他感到无精打采，悲伤了好几天。现在听到明日香还活着的消息，尽管听起来难以置信，尤其是真嗣说的，他仍然感到前所未有的宽慰。他不明白为什么相信真嗣，但他就是觉得真嗣说的是真话。“那真是太好了……真嗣。”他还是想知道真嗣是怎么知道的，“但你怎么知道的？我是说，她在法国，你们是怎么联系的？”

"I… I…" Shinji sighed, "I can't tell you, either. Please understand, Kaji-san."  
“我……我……”真嗣叹了口气，“我也不能告诉你，请理解，加持先生。”

"Hmmm… fine then." He agreed to Shinji just for now, since he had other questions to ask. "Im curious about how much do you know about SEELE and your father's… plan?"  
"嗯……好吧。" 他暂时同意了真嗣，因为他还有其他问题要问。"我很好奇，你对 SEELE 和你父亲的……计划了解多少？"

"As far as I know, they're planning to start Third Impact on their own," Shinji said, "so they can become gods of some sorts."  
"据我所知，他们计划自行引发第三次冲击，" 真嗣说，"这样他们就能成为某种神。"

"Third… Impact?" Kaji blinked, "what's gonna happen then?"  
"第三次……冲击？" 加持眨了眨眼，"那会发生什么？"

"Everyone on earth would be dead, I guess…" Shinji decided to not give out too much detail for now; making things vague could still help  
“我想地球上的每个人都会死的……”真嗣决定暂时不透露太多细节；保持模糊或许仍能有所帮助

him not to blow his cover yet. "and Kaji-san, you're gonna die if you keep doing this…"  
让他不要这么快暴露身份。“还有加持先生，如果你继续这样下去，你会死的……”

Kaji couldn't help but chuckle, "you sound like you've already seen me die before, so you know…"  
加持忍不住轻笑，“你听起来好像已经见过我死了一样，所以你知道……”

'You don't know how right you are,' Shinji thought. "Just want you to be careful, Kaji-san…" Shinji rolled over so he's back now facing Kaji, indicating he's gonna end the conversation and go sleep. "Good night, Kaji-san…"  
“你不知道自己有多正确，”真嗣心想。“只是希望你小心点，加持先生……”真嗣翻身背对加持，表示他要结束对话去睡觉了。“晚安，加持先生……”

"Good night, Shinji-kun." Kaji said. However, he couldn't sleep yet. He was still immersed in his thoughts; today the boy called Shinji Ikari had proved to be a very interesting person, and Kaji wasn't going to let him go yet.  
“晚安，真嗣君。”加持说道。然而，他还未能入睡。他仍沉浸在自己的思绪中；今天那个名叫碇真嗣的男孩证明了自己是个非常有趣的人，加持还不打算就此放过他。

Matsushiro had always been a quiet place. However, today the silence was replaced by roars of heavy machinery and VTOL engines.  
松代一直是个安静的地方。然而，今天这份宁静被重型机械和垂直起降引擎的轰鸣声所取代。

"Is the pilot ready?" Dr. Akagi looked over at one of the techs sitting next to her. "The pilot is ready." He answered.  
"驾驶员准备好了吗？" 赤城博士看向坐在她旁边的一位技术人员。"驾驶员已准备就绪。" 他回答道。

"Alright." The blonde nodded, looking back at her terminal before doing one more check of Unit 03's system, ensuring that everything was ready for the activation test.  
"好的。" 金发女子点头，回头看向她的终端，再次检查了 03 号机系统，确保一切就绪，准备进行启动测试。

"Begin activation." The technicians started to carry out their various tasks, monitoring the EVA Unit as it came online. Its yellow eyes lit up and the sound of various machines in the observation room began to beep and chirp as they took in the readings from the Evangelion's performance.  
"开始启动。" 技术人员们开始执行各自的任务，监控着 EVA 单位上线。它的黄色眼睛亮起，观察室内的各种机器开始发出哔哔和啾啾声，记录着福音战士的表现数据。

"Synch level is rising." The technician sitting next to Ritsuko announced. "The pilot is approaching the borderline threshold."  
"同步率正在上升。"坐在律子旁边的技术员宣布道，"驾驶员正接近临界阈值。"

Misato walked up next to Ritsuko and peered over her shoulder, watching as the synchrograph began to align and the red bars indicating the pilot's synch ratio started to light up. Within seconds of passing the threshold, Unit 03 fully coming to life, and every single alarm in the Matsushiro testing facility began to roar. Misato started frantically looking around the observation room, trying to identify the problem, but when she looked back at Dr. Akagi's terminal, it all became clear to her. The synchrograph began to drastically shift out of alignment, yet Toji's synch ratio continued to rise.  
美里走到律子身边，越过她的肩膀看去，只见同步图开始对齐，代表驾驶员同步率的红色条开始亮起。在越过阈值的瞬间，03 号机完全启动，松代测试设施内的每一个警报都开始咆哮。美里疯狂地环顾观察室，试图找出问题所在，但当她回头看向赤木博士的终端时，一切对她来说都变得清晰了。同步图开始急剧偏离对齐，然而东治的同步率仍在上升。

"Cut connection! Abort the test!" Ritsuko yelled. She had seen the same thing when Unit 00 went berserk.  
"切断连接！终止测试！"律子大喊。她在 00 号机暴走时也见过同样的情景。

"It's not shutting down!" Misato screamed as the giant robot pulled free from restraints. Unit 03's mouth restraints shattered into tiny little shards of metal, freeing its jaw and exposing its blocky red teeth.  
“它没有停机！”美里尖叫着，巨大的机器人挣脱了束缚。三号机的口部束缚装置碎裂成无数小金属片，解放了它的下颚，露出了那排方形的红色牙齿。

After that, everything went dark.  
之后，一切陷入了黑暗。

Toji found himself floating in the brightness. He had absolutely no idea about what happened. He only remembered getting into the entry plug, and waited for activation. Then everything went white. Shaking his head, Toji looked around and found nothing. Suddenly he heard a distant voice; or rather, the voice appeared in his head.  
真嗣发现自己漂浮在一片光明之中。他完全不知道发生了什么。他只记得自己进入了插入栓，等待着启动。然后一切变得一片空白。他摇了摇头，环顾四周，什么也没发现。突然，他听到了一个遥远的声音；或者说，这声音出现在他的脑海中。

_Become one with me… come… become one with me…  
与我合为一体…来吧…与我合为一体…_

"Who the hell are you? Where am I?" Toji shouted.  
“你到底是谁？我在哪儿？”冬二大喊。

_Y ou must become on with me…  
你必须与我合一…_

"I am I, not you! You sick piece of trash!"  
"我就是我，不是你！你这个变态垃圾！"

_Y ou have left me no choice…  
你逼我别无选择……_

Toji suddenly found himself standing in the hallway of a hospital. He wanted to feel confused, and he was, but he decided nothing could be weirder than the nothingness he had just experienced. He then  
突然间，冬二发现自己站在医院走廊里。他想感到困惑，确实也困惑，但他觉得没有什么比刚刚经历的虚无更奇怪的了。随后

recognized the hospital was his sister's. He quickly ran down the hallway and found her room, and pushed the door open.  
意识到这是他妹妹所在的医院。他迅速沿着走廊跑去，找到了她的病房，推门而入。

In the room Sakura lay in the bed, just like every time he had visited. Toji walked to her bedside and sat down, pulling his right hand up to caress her cheek. However, Sakura faded away before he could touch her.  
房间里，Sakura 像他每次来访时一样躺在床上。Toji 走到她的床边坐下，抬起右手想要抚摸她的脸颊。然而，Sakura 在他触碰之前就消失了。

Toji shot up from the chair, "What the hell?"  
Toji 猛地从椅子上站起来，“搞什么鬼？”

_She will die if you don't become one with me…  
如果你不与我合为一体，她就会死……_

"No! I don't believe you! You are just tricking my mind!" Toji shouted back angrily. The scene suddenly changed again, this time showing Hikari sitting inside Unit 02, a worried look on her face.  
"不！我不相信你！你只是在欺骗我的思想！" 真嗣愤怒地回喊。场景突然再次变化，这次显示的是明日香坐在二号机内，脸上带着担忧的表情。

_She will die as well if you don't become one with me…  
如果你不与我合为一体，她也会死……_

"Who the fuck are you? Why are you showing me these?" Toji yelled, suddenly realized something. 'Hikari's in Unit 02, is she… ready to fight something? The only thing that needs an EVA to counter is an Angel… does that mean Hikari is facing an Angel? And this strange place… it's threatening me with Hikari… so maybe it's the Angel talking to me…' "No! I will not let you hurt her!"  
"你他妈是谁？为什么给我看这些？" 冬二大喊道，突然意识到什么。'光在二号机里，她……准备好战斗了吗？需要 EVA 对抗的只有使徒……这意味着光正面对使徒？而这个奇怪的地方……它用光来威胁我……所以可能是使徒在跟我说话……' "不！我不会让你伤害她的！"

_There's nothing you can do… you Lilim are weak… become one with me…  
你无能为力……你们人类太弱了……与我合为一体吧……_

"No! Get the fuck away from me!"  
"不！给我滚开！"

It seemed like the Angel was losing its patience, so it decided to use another approach. Toji suddenly felt pain surge through his entire body; the pain was nothing like what he felt before. Waves after waves of intolerable pain traveled through him. He started screaming.  
天使似乎失去了耐心，于是决定采用另一种方法。真嗣突然感到全身剧痛袭来；这种痛苦前所未有。一波又一波难以忍受的疼痛在他体内肆虐。他开始尖叫。

_I'll end your pain if you become one with me…  
如果你与我合一，我将结束你的痛苦…_

Toji wanted to retort, but he couldn't. The pain was excruciating. 'Can't… hold… much longer…' He thought, 'sorry… Hikari… sorry… Sakura… I think Im gonna give up…' Just as he was about to submit, suddenly the pain disappeared. He was extremely exhausted, and he felt like sleeping. The moment before he closed his eyes, he saw a swirl of red flashing in front of him.  
真嗣想反驳，却无法开口。疼痛难以忍受。'撑…不下…去了…'他想着，'对不起…光…对不起…樱…我想我要放弃了…'就在他即将屈服之际，疼痛突然消失了。他极度疲惫，感觉像是要睡着了。在他闭眼前的那一刻，他看到眼前闪过一团红色漩涡。

"It's pattern orange." Hyuga spoke, looking up at the giant screen being projected in front of the Command Center's front deck, showing the black EVA Unit slowly trudging its way through the hilly countryside, making its way towards Tokyo-3. "We can't tell if it's an Angel or not."  
"这是橙色警戒模式。" 日向看着指挥中心前甲板上巨大的投影屏幕，屏幕上显示着黑色的 EVA 单位缓慢地穿越起伏的乡村，向东京-3 前进。"我们无法确定它是否是使徒。"

"Plug ejection failed, something blocked it from ejecting," Maya  
"弹射失败，有什么东西阻碍了它弹出，" 真耶

reported.

"Unfortunate." Gendo, sitting in his office looking down the command deck, "Identify Unit 03 as the thirteenth Angel. Destroy it at all costs."  
"不幸。" 碇源堂坐在他的办公室里，俯视着指挥甲板，"将 03 号单位识别为第十三使徒。不惜一切代价摧毁它。"

His voice cold and firm

"But the pilots' still inside," Makoto said, "we should…"  
“但驾驶员还在里面，”真琴说，“我们应该……”

"Irrelevant," Gendo snapped at him, "Destroying the Angel is our primary concern. The pilot's life is out of consideration. That is an order."  
“无关紧要，”源堂厉声对他说，“摧毁使徒是我们的首要任务。驾驶员的生命不在考虑之列。这是命令。”

Inside Unit D, Shinji was grasping his control yokes tightly. In fact with his Angelic strength, the yoke was begging to crack. Standing beside him was Unit 02, with Hikari piloting it. Although she had only been training for two days, the Commander still sent her out in the field, hoping her to at least act as a distraction. Unit 00 stood farther away, holding a sniper rifle in its hands.  
在 D 型机内，真嗣紧握着操纵杆。实际上，凭借他天使般的力量，操纵杆已经开始出现裂痕。站在他旁边的是 02 号机，由光驾驶。尽管她只接受了两天训练，指挥官仍将她派上战场，希望她至少能起到牵制作用。00 号机则站得更远，手中持着一把狙击步枪。

"Shinji… what's going on?" Hikari opened the communication channel with Unit D, her voice slightly trembling, "Are we fighting an  
"真嗣…发生了什么？" 光打开了与 D 单位的通讯频道，她的声音微微颤抖，"我们在与什么战斗？

Angel?"

"Yeah, Hikari… don't worry, I won't let it hurt you or Rei." Shinji said. He could only hope Asuka's plan will work. "Rei, any sign of the target yet?"  
"是的，光…别担心，我不会让它伤害你或丽。" 真嗣说。他只能希望明日香的计划能奏效。"丽，发现目标了吗？"

Rei's ghostly voice broke in. "I've found it." She spoke. "Look towards the sun."  
丽那幽灵般的声音插了进来。"我找到了。" 她说。"看向太阳的方向。"

Both pilots turned their EVAs towards the setting sun, where they could see a humanoid silhouette contrasted against the bright orange light of the sun. Its upper body was slouched forward, letting its arms dangle around its knees, and its steps were barely more than slow trudges.  
两位驾驶员将他们的 EVA 转向落日方向，在那里可以看到一个与明亮的橙色阳光形成鲜明对比的人形轮廓。它的上半身向前倾斜，手臂垂在膝盖周围，步伐几乎只是缓慢的拖行。

"T… t… that's an EVA Unit!" Hikari stuttered. "That means that… Oh God." Her voice lower and lower, her hands shivering.  
"那…那…那是 EVA 单位！" 光颤抖着说。"这意味着…哦，天哪。"她的声音越来越低，双手颤抖。

"Hikari!" Shinji barked. "Don't freak out right now! Is the pilot still inside?" He asked, trying to assess the situation.  
"光！" 真嗣厉声道。"现在别慌！驾驶员还在里面吗？" 他试图评估情况。

"That isn't relevant." Commander Ikari answered. "What the Hell do you mean it isn't relev-"  
"那无关紧要。" 碇司令回答道。"你说的'无关紧要'到底是什么意思-"

"You are not to concern yourselves with the Fourth Child." His voice grew a little sterner, "Unit 03 has been contaminated by the Thirteenth Angel, and as such needs to be destroyed at all costs. Is that understood."  
"你们无需关心第四适格者。" 他的语气变得更加严厉，"三号机被第十三使徒污染了，因此必须不惜一切代价摧毁。明白了吗？"

"Wait," Makoto said, "I'm detecting another pattern orange inside Unit 03."  
"等等，" 真希波说，"我在三号机内部检测到了另一个橙色信号。"

Gendo's eyes twitched. "Status report!"  
源度的眼睛抽搐了一下。“状态报告！”

"Pattern orange appeared 30 seconds ago," Makoto reported, "Wait! Pattern orange disappeared!… Huh?"  
“30 秒前出现了橙色模式，”真琴报告道，“等等！橙色模式消失了！……咦？”

Before he could say anything, Maya continued, "Commander, we've lost pilots' life signs. He's gone."  
他还没来得及说什么，真耶继续说道，“指挥官，我们失去了驾驶员的生命迹象。他不在了。”

"More like he disappeared…" Makoto murmured.  
“更像是他消失了……”真琴喃喃道。

Shinji had been listening closely to the conversation that happened on the bridge through comms. He couldn't help but smile, since he knew she had succeeded.  
真嗣一直在通过通讯设备仔细聆听桥上的对话。他忍不住微笑，因为他知道她成功了。

_Two minutes earlier_

The moment Asuka came out of the sea of Dirac she felt a strange voice sounded in her head.  
当明日香从狄拉克之海中出来时，她感到一个奇怪的声音在脑海中响起。

_Hmmm… interesting… another Lilim…  
嗯……有意思……又一个莉莉姆……_

She looked around and found Toji laying in his pilots' seat unconscious. She tried to reach out him and get him outta there, however she was blocked by an invisible wall.  
她环顾四周，发现真嗣躺在他的驾驶员座位上不省人事。她试图伸手去救他，却被一道无形的墙挡住了。

_Stupid… you Lilim are so weak… you come here just for nothing… you will become on with me as well…  
愚蠢……你们莉莉姆真是弱不禁风……来这里一无所获……你也会成为我的一部分……_

Asuka let out a half laugh. "Heh, listen up you sick ass stupid bastard, I'm gonna show you!" She quickly expanded her AT-Field, which collided with Bardiel's. The sheer force of collision started to make the entry plug vibrate. Asuka didn't know how strong her AT- Field could be, so she summoned all of her willpower to concentrate.  
明日香发出半声轻笑。“哼，听着，你这个变态混蛋，我要让你见识见识！”她迅速展开自己的 AT 力场，与 Bardiel 的力场相撞。碰撞的强大力量使得插入栓开始震动。明日香不知道自己的 AT 力场能有多强，于是她集中全部意志力来专注。

"Arghhhhh!" Asuka roared angrily. Her AT-Field was increasing in power, however it still seemed insufficient to completely erode Bardiel's.  
“啊啊啊啊！”明日香愤怒地咆哮。她的 AT 力场正在增强，但似乎仍不足以完全侵蚀 Bardiel 的力场。

Although the Angel's AT-Field was stronger, it couldn't overpower Asuka that easily. In fact, they were in a stalemate. Bardiel decided to take another approach.  
尽管天使的 AT 力场更强，但它无法轻易压倒明日香。实际上，双方陷入了僵局。Bardiel 决定采取另一种策略。

Asuka suddenly felt pain coming from her left foot. Lowering her head, she saw erosive tendrils forming around her left foot; Bardiel wanted to physically contaminated Asuka, or at least force her out of  
明日香突然感到左脚传来一阵剧痛。她低下头，看到腐蚀性的触须正缠绕在她的左脚周围；巴迪尔想要物理上污染明日香，或者至少迫使她离开

there. Asuka screamed in pain; knowing there weren't many options left, she wandered into her mental world and searched for her darkest memories.  
那里。明日香痛苦地尖叫起来；知道没有多少选择余地，她游走在自己的精神世界中，寻找着最黑暗的记忆。

The nature of an AT-Field was your mental barrier, the place where no one shall enter freely. In order to create stronger AT-Fields while inside an EVA, NERV needed to find pilots who shut themselves from the world. Asuka's mentality had been steadily improving ever since she had been with Shinji; but instead of opening up to the world completely, she had simply built a new barrier around two of them. Now though, in order to increase the power of her AT-Field, her college-graduate-level-intelligence told her she needed to close her heart for the moment. The fastest way to do so was to… remember her darkest memories.  
AT 力场的本质是你的心灵屏障，是任何人都无法自由进入的地方。为了在 EVA 内部创造更强大的 AT 力场，NERV 需要找到那些与世界隔绝的驾驶员。自从与真嗣在一起后，明日香的心态一直在稳步改善；但她并没有完全向世界敞开心扉，而是仅仅在他们两人周围建立了一道新的屏障。然而现在，为了增强她的 AT 力场，她那大学毕业水平的智慧告诉她，她需要暂时封闭自己的心。最快的方法就是……回忆起她最黑暗的记忆。

'I'm strong… I'm strong…' Asuka kept telling herself that while she recalled those horrible memories, loneliness, pain, angst, all these emotions surged through her mind.  
"'我很坚强…我很坚强…' 明日香不断地这样告诉自己，同时回想起那些可怕的记忆，孤独、痛苦、焦虑，所有的这些情绪涌上心头。

Then she recalled the day Shinji and her first kissed. Determination surged through her mind.  
"接着她想起了真嗣和她第一次接吻的那天。决心涌上心头。

Asuka lifted her head. Her eyes glowing bright blue. Bardiel's AT-Field shattered like cheap glass.  
"明日香抬起头。她的眼睛闪烁着明亮的蓝色光芒。巴迪尔的 AT 力场像廉价玻璃一样破碎了。

She took a firm hold on Toji's wrist, dragged him out of the seat with ease.  
她紧紧抓住冬二的手腕，轻松地将他从座位上拖了出来。

_What… impossible… how? 什么…不可能…怎么回事？_

"Because I'm the great Asuka Langley Soryu, you little Scheiß e!" Asuka soon called out the sea of Dirac, "now enjoy what's waiting for you!" She threw Toji's unconscious body into the darkness, moments later she entered it as well.  
“因为我就是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你这个小混蛋！”明日香随即向着狄拉克之海大喊，“现在好好享受你的等待吧！”她将昏迷的冬二抛入黑暗中，片刻后自己也随之进入。

Outside in the field, Unit D's pilot smiled as he saw Unit 03 stopped moving forward, almost like hesitating. 'Great work, Asuka.' He  
在户外的战场上，D 单位的驾驶员看到 03 单位停止了前进，仿佛在犹豫。他微笑着，'干得好，明日香。' 他

thought. "Rei! Cover me!"  
心想。 "绫波！掩护我！"

"Roger." Rei said, she immediately began firing. A single armor piercing round flew toward Unit 03, but before it could make any contact, it was stopped by Bardiel's AT-Field.  
"收到。" 绫波说道，她立刻开始射击。一枚穿甲弹朝着 03 单位飞去，但在它能够接触到目标之前，被巴迪尔的 AT 力场挡住了。

Before she could pull the trigger again, Unit 03 pushed its hands towards the ground, projecting an AT-Field as it did so. With the force of the AT-Field, it shot itself up about two hundred meters into the air and avoided the incoming bullet. The blue-haired pilot managed to let out a gasp before the black Angel came crashing down onto her. It buried its good knee into the back of Unit 00, sending it crumbling down into a prone position while Unit 03's hands firmly grasped both of its arms. Then the real pain came. Unit 03 tightened its grip around Unit 00's arms, sending little tendrils of contamination through the EVA's body, crawling under its skin. Rei screamed and squirmed in an effort to writhe out of the Angel's grasp, but the blinding pain kept her from being able to even attempt to fight back.  
在她再次扣动扳机之前，三号机将双手推向地面，同时展开了 AT 力场。借助 AT 力场的力量，它将自己弹射至约两百米的高空，避开了飞来的子弹。蓝发驾驶员在黑色使徒猛然坠落向她时，勉强发出了一声惊呼。使徒用其完好的膝盖猛击零号机的背部，使其轰然倒地，同时三号机的双手牢牢钳住了零号机的双臂。紧接着，真正的痛苦降临了。三号机收紧了对零号机手臂的束缚，污染的细丝通过 EVA 机体蔓延，在皮肤下蠕动。绫波丽痛苦地尖叫并挣扎，试图挣脱使徒的掌控，但剧烈的疼痛让她连反击的尝试都无法进行。

Unit 03 looked up to see its approaching opponent Unit D, its arms still locked around Unit 00. The Angel made one firm jerking motion, pulling both of Unit 00's arms off with ease, making a loud crack and snap as it did so. Followed by this was a bloodcurdling scream from its pilot. Inside Unit D, Shinji could feel his heart drop even further as her cries of pain echoed through his ears. By the time Shinji reached the Angel, it was already back on its feet. In his charge, he lunged the knife forward, aiming for where Unit 03's core would be. The black creature shifted to the side, avoiding the attack, but not avoiding the second slash from Unit D, cutting into its narrow abdomen. LCL started to drip from the wound, the dark red contrasting strongly with its black armor. "Die, you bastard!" He made a downward swing, only for the Angel to leap back and skid its feet against the grassy ground, shooting a cloud of dirt up into the air. He rushed forward and delivered a hard punch to the gut, causing Unit 03 to lurch forward, revealing the back of its neck. Ikari looked down to see that Toji's Entry Plug was still inside it; he  
零三号机抬头望向逼近的对手 D 号机，双臂依旧紧锁着零号机。使徒猛地一拽，轻而易举地将零号机的双臂扯断，断裂声响彻云霄，紧接着是驾驶员撕心裂肺的尖叫。在 D 号机内部，真嗣听到她的痛呼，心如坠冰窟。当真嗣冲到使徒面前时，它已重新站稳。他疾步前冲，将刀锋直指零三号机的核心所在。黑色怪物侧身闪避，却未能躲过 D 号机的第二击，锋刃划破其狭长的腹部，LCL 从伤口滴落，深红与黑甲形成鲜明对比。“去死吧，混蛋！”他挥刀下劈，使徒却后跃并滑行于草地，扬起一片尘土。真嗣疾步上前，一拳重击其腹部，迫使零三号机前倾，露出后颈。碇真嗣低头一看，发现东治的插入栓仍嵌在其中；他

decided to at least keep its shape intact, so later when Asuka send Toji back they'll have excuse for Toji's survival. Shinji quickly deployed an AT-Field to stop Unit 03 in its tracks. Though it would only hinder the Angel momentarily, it did give Shinji enough time to assess the situation. Before he could come up with a good plan, Unit 03 ripped through his AT-Field and continued its charge with a roar.  
决定至少保持其形态完好，以便日后明日香送回真嗣时，他们能有真嗣幸存的借口。真嗣迅速展开 AT 力场，试图阻止 03 号机前进。虽然这只能暂时阻碍使徒，但确实给了真嗣足够的时间来评估局势。在他想出好计划之前，03 号机撕裂了他的 AT 力场，伴随着咆哮继续冲锋。

Knowing that he had to keep moving, Shinji leaped upwards, letting the Angel rush right past him. Once the EVA landed, the ground around him began to tremble, and he found himself standing directly behind Unit 03. Now was his chance. In one quick motion, Unit 01 dashed forward and dug its knee into the center of the Angel's back, knocking it flat on its face while he pressed it down with all of his weight. The black Evangelion squirmed and writhed, trying to shake him off, but Shinji stood firmly. "Stop moving!" He growled, delivering a hard elbow to the back of Unit 03's head, causing it to tense up in pain. Frustrated, Ikari bashed his elbow against the back of the Angel's head again, and again, and again. Each blow caused it to bellow out in pain. After the final hit, the Evangelion ceased its resistance.  
深知自己必须保持移动，真嗣一跃而起，让使徒从他身旁冲过。EVA 着陆后，地面开始颤动，他发现自己正站在 03 号机后方。机会来了。01 号机迅速前冲，用膝盖顶入使徒背部中央，将其击倒在地，同时用全身重量将其压住。黑色 EVA 挣扎扭动，试图甩开他，但真嗣稳如泰山。“别动！”他咆哮着，狠狠一肘击中 03 号机后脑，使其因疼痛而紧绷。愤怒之下，真嗣再次、又一次、再又一次地用肘撞击使徒后脑，每一次都让它痛苦嘶吼。最后一击后，EVA 停止了抵抗。

During the entire time of the battle, Unit 02 simply stood there and watched. Seeing the fight was now over, Hikari's trembling voice came in the comms "S-S-Shinji, i-is it o-over?"  
战斗全程，02 号机只是静静地站在那里观望。看到战斗结束，通讯器中传来光颤抖的声音：“真-真嗣，结-结束了吗？”

"Don't worry, Hikari. It's all over now. And I'm sure Toji is fine." During the fight Shinji made sure to at least keep the entry plug structurally intact, so that it would be more convincing that Toji survived the fight. Shinji knelt down and pulled out the entry plug from Unit 03, carried it to a safe place and gently put it down. A group of rescuers came and cut the entry plug open. LCL poured out.  
"别担心，光。现在一切都结束了。我相信真嗣会没事的。" 在战斗中，真嗣确保至少让插入栓结构保持完整，以便更令人信服地认为真嗣幸存了下来。真嗣跪下，从 03 号机中取出插入栓，将其搬到一个安全的地方，并轻轻放下。一群救援人员赶到，切开了插入栓。LCL 液体涌出。

"We found the pilot," one of the rescuers reported to the command deck, "… life sighs normal. Pilot unconscious."  
"我们找到了驾驶员，" 一名救援人员向指挥室报告，"…生命体征正常。驾驶员昏迷。"

Everyone let out a big sigh of relief hearing the news. As impossible as it seems, Toji survived the 13th Angel. No one cared about the sudden disappearance of life signs during the battle or the strange  
听到这个消息，大家都松了一口气。尽管看似不可能，真嗣幸存了下来，击败了第 13 使徒。没人关心战斗中生命体征的突然消失或那些奇怪的

pattern orange; maybe Ritsuko would pay attention to it, but she was still unconscious caused by the explosion in Matsushiro.  
橙色模式；或许律子会注意到它，但她仍因松代的那场爆炸而昏迷不醒。

Commander Ikari tensed up hearing the report. In his scenario his son was supposed to at least hurt Toji badly so he would be consumed by his guilt, a step towards his mental breakdown.  
听到报告，碇司令紧张起来。按照他的设想，他的儿子至少应该让真嗣受重伤，从而被内疚感吞噬，这是他精神崩溃的一步。

However now it seems nothing is working as anticipated. He couldn't understand why his son showed not a bit of hesitation when fighting Unit 03. He was supposed to freeze up since he shouldn't want to hurt the pilot, wasn't he? Furthermore, the death of the Second Child  
然而现在看来，一切都没有按预期发展。他不明白为什么他的儿子在与三号机战斗时没有丝毫犹豫。他不是应该因为不想伤害驾驶员而僵住吗？此外，二号机的死亡

seemed to have no effect on his mental state. Curious.  
似乎对他的精神状态毫无影响。真奇怪。

Misato's eyes fluttered open, at first being blinded by a bright light beaming down on her face, contrasting strongly against the night sky. As she came to, she was able to make out the silhouette of a man leaning over her. His long hair flowed behind him as his ponytail blew in the wind. Even though the floodlights behind him made it impossible to see his features, Katsuragi already knew who it was. "Kaji…" She spoke wearily, trying to lean up, only to feel a sharp stabbing sensation shoot through her left arm. She grimaced in pain, falling back down to the stretcher she was laying on while Kaji crouched down to her level.  
美里睁开眼睛，起初被照在脸上的强光刺得睁不开眼，与夜空形成强烈对比。她逐渐清醒，看到一个男人的轮廓俯视着她。他的长发随风飘扬，马尾在风中摇曳。尽管他身后的泛光灯使他的面容难以辨认，但葛城已经知道他是谁。“加持…”她疲惫地说道，试图坐起来，却感到左臂一阵剧痛。她痛苦地皱眉，倒回担架上，而加持则蹲下身来与她平视。

"You hurt your arm pretty badly in the explosion." His soft voice was the just the thing she needed to hear, especially since the last thing she could remember was hearing Unit 03's head splitting roar when it went berserk and broke free of its restraints. Unit 03… "Oh God!" She shot up again, this time ignoring the pain in her arm. "Toji! Is he alright?!"  
“你在爆炸中伤到了手臂，相当严重。”他温柔的声音正是她此刻需要的，尤其是她最后记得的是 03 号机发狂挣脱束缚时头部发出的撕裂咆哮。03 号机……“哦，天哪！”她再次坐起，这次无视了手臂的疼痛。“冬二！他没事吧？！”

"He's physically okay, still unconscious. No one else was hurt. Shinji overpowered Unit 03 and secured the entry plug."  
“他身体无恙，只是仍处于昏迷状态。没有其他人受伤。真嗣制服了 03 号机并确保了驾驶舱的安全。”

Misato smiled, feeling proud of her kid.  
美里微笑着，为她的孩子感到骄傲。

Toji slowly opened his eyes; after his eyes had adjusted from the sudden increase in brightness, he found himself staring at an unfamiliar ceiling. 'Guess I'm still alive,' He thought, 'wonder what happened… the last thing I remember is floating in brightness…' Toji groaned, trying to move around a little, but he felt weight pressed on his body. Turning his head, he saw dark brown hair and two pigtails. 'Hikari…' Toji smiled, 'I'm glad you're okay…'  
当眼睛适应了突如其来的亮度后，东治缓缓睁开双眼，发现自己正盯着一片陌生的天花板。'看来我还活着，'他想，'不知道发生了什么……我只记得最后漂浮在一片光亮中……'东治呻吟着，试图稍微动一下，却感到身上有重压。他转过头，看到了深棕色的头发和两条辫子。'光……'东治微笑着，'很高兴你没事……'

The sleeping brunette jerked a little and made some sleepy noises. She slowly turned her head just to look directly into Toji's eyes.  
沉睡中的深褐色头发女孩微微一颤，发出些许困倦的声音。她缓缓转过头，直视着 Toji 的眼睛。

"Toji! You're awake!" Hikari exclaimed in joyfulness, but the next moment tears rolled out, "Oh my god… I was so worried… I-I thought…"  
“Toji！你醒了！”Hikari 欣喜地喊道，但下一刻泪水涌出，“哦，天哪……我好担心……我以为……”

Toji smiled weakly, "It's okay Hikari… I'm here now."  
Toji 虚弱地笑了笑，“没事的，Hikari……我现在在这里。”

"Glad to see you okay, Toji." Toji looked in the direction of the voice, found Shinji standing at the door. "Yo, Shin-man… glad to see you okay too…" Toji shook his head, trying to clear his mind, "what happened to me?"  
"很高兴看到你没事，冬二。" 冬二顺着声音的方向看去，发现真嗣站在门口。"哟，真哥们…也很高兴看到你没事…" 冬二摇了摇头，试图理清思绪，"我怎么了？"

"There was an Angel inside Unit 03," Shinji replied, walking into the ward and sat down at bedside, "it took control of the EVA and attacked us. I killed the Angel and got you out."  
"03 号机里有一个使徒，" 真嗣回答，走进病房并坐在床边，"它控制了 EVA 并向我们发起攻击。我消灭了使徒，把你救了出来。"

"Thanks a lot, Shin-man… you saved my life, again." Toji couldn't express how grateful he was, so he simply patted Shinji's shoulder. "Uh… you're welcome? I mean, you're my friend; I'd look after you when I can, right?"  
"多谢了，真哥们…你又一次救了我的命。" 冬二无法用言语表达他的感激之情，于是他只是拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。"呃…不客气？我是说，你是我的朋友；我会在我能做到的时候照顾你，对吧？"

Toji felt his tears threatened to come out, but he suppressed them. He felt a man like him wasn't supposed to cry like that. "Just… thanks…"  
冬二感到泪水快要涌出，但他强忍住了。他觉得像他这样的男人不应该那样哭泣。“只是……谢谢……”

"What do you remember, by the way?" Shinji wanted to know whether Toji was aware of what actually happened; he didn't want Toji to know the truth about him and Asuka yet.  
“顺便问一下，你记得什么？”真嗣想知道冬二是否清楚发生了什么；他还不想让冬二知道他和明日香之间的真相。

"Errr… I remember being in the entry plug, and then I was floating in brightness. I could see nothin but white. Then… I think the Angel was talking to me. He wanted to become one with me… I refused, so it wanted to force me by pain, and I passed out… then woke up here." Toji recalled, leaving out unnecessary details. He didn't want Hikari to know the horrible things the Angel had shown him.  
“呃……我记得在插入栓里，然后我漂浮在光亮中。除了白色什么也看不见。然后……我想是使徒在跟我说话。它想与我合为一体……我拒绝了，所以它想通过痛苦强迫我，然后我就昏过去了……醒来就在这里。”冬二回忆道，省略了一些不必要的细节。他不想让光子知道使徒给他展示的可怕事情。

Shinji felt relieved and let out a sigh. "Okay… I'm glad I killed it just in time…"  
真嗣感到松了一口气，叹了口气。“好吧……我很高兴及时干掉了它……”

Asuka was waiting anxiously in the apartment. Toji still had to stay in the hospital for a while since they need to make sure he was clear of contamination, and Misato was injured and Kaji had to look after her so there's some time for her and Shinji to spend in the apartment alone. She was in a good mood; after all she had faced one of the most troublesome Angels face to face and fought it with _bare hands,_ and she had successfully finished her job. She had never felt so strong before; her ego was flying to the sky. But she was still worried about the next Angel, since she couldn't pilot Unit 02 this time. She was worried about Hikari; apparently without proper training she would be slaughtered by Z eruel, and she didn't want her best friend to be hurt.  
明日香在公寓里焦急地等待着。由于需要确保他没有受到污染，剑介还得在医院里待一段时间，而美里受伤了，加持不得不照顾她，所以她和真嗣有一段时间可以单独待在公寓里。她心情很好；毕竟她面对面地面对了最麻烦的使徒之一，并赤手空拳地与之战斗，而且她成功地完成了任务。她从未感到如此强大；她的自信心直冲云霄。但她仍然担心下一个使徒，因为她这次无法驾驶二号机。她担心光；显然，没有适当的训练，她会被零号使徒屠杀，她不想她最好的朋友受到伤害。

"Tadaima." Shinji's voice came from the door.  
“我回来了。”真嗣的声音从门口传来。

"Shinji!" Asuka cried happily, running to the door and gave him a fierce hug. Shinji could only return it happily. "Asuka! I knew you're the best!"  
"真嗣！" 明日香开心地喊着，跑向门口给了他一个紧紧的拥抱。真嗣只能高兴地回应。"明日香！我就知道你是最棒的！"

"What do you expect, Baka-Shinji?" Asuka pulled over from the hug eventually, keeping a big smile on her face, "I fought the stupid Angel with my bare hands! It never stood a chance against the great Asuka Langley Soryu!"  
"你还能指望什么，笨蛋真嗣？" 明日香最终从拥抱中挣脱出来，脸上保持着大大的笑容，"我用双手与那愚蠢的天使战斗！伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷面前，它毫无胜算！"

Shinji chuckled. It felt good to see Asuka being so confident and prideful. He remembered the main reasons of Asuka being depressed in his timeline was because her pride was hurt badly by  
真嗣轻声笑了。看到明日香如此自信和自豪，他感到很欣慰。他记得在原来的时间线中，明日香抑郁的主要原因是因为她的骄傲受到了严重的伤害，而

her defeat against the Angels. It wasn't that she wasn't good enough; she was simply unlucky. She had thought her defeat against the 14th and 15th Angel was because she was weak, while the truth was no one else could do better if put into the same situation. "Asuka, what do we do about the next one? You can't pilot Unit 02 or Unit D or they'll be suspicious!"  
她在与使徒的战斗中败北。并非她不够优秀，只是运气不佳。她曾以为自己输给第 14 和第 15 使徒是因为自己太弱，而事实是，换作任何人在同样的情况下也未必能做得更好。“明日香，下一个使徒怎么办？你不能再驾驶 02 号机或 D 型机了，否则他们会起疑的！”

Asuka thought about this for a while, and sighed. "I honestly don't know… I'll watch closely, tho. Just don't get destroyed too quickly so I'll have to save your ass! And don't let Hikari get hurt, you understood?"  
明日香思索片刻，叹了口气。“老实说，我不知道……不过我会密切观察的。别那么快就被摧毁，不然我还得救你！还有，别让 Hikari 受伤，明白了吗？”

"Jawohl Mein Fü hrer!" Shinji mocked, "Errr… how much time do we have?"  
“遵命，我的元首！”真嗣嘲讽道，“呃……我们还有多少时间？”

"Hmph. Probably several hours. What, getting any pervy ideas on your mind?" Asuka said in a teasing tone.  
"哼。大概几个小时吧。怎么，脑子里有什么不正经的想法吗？" 明日香用一种挑逗的语气说道。

Shinji blushed a little, "Wha-No! Errr, I mean, yes, but… what I wanted to do was to make you some German dishes, since I know you must've been missing these…"  
真嗣微微脸红，"什、不！呃，我是说，是的，但是……我想做的是给你做些德国菜，因为我知道你一定很想念这些……"

Asuka smiled widely, "Good. You're right, I haven't eaten for a long time… I'd really like to taste some of my boyfriend's great cooking!"  
明日香笑得十分灿烂，"好啊。你说得对，我已经很久没吃东西了……真的很想尝尝我男朋友的好手艺！"

Without a word Shinji went to kitchen, got out some ingredients and started cooking. He was to make some Sauerkraut and baked Schnitzel. Asuka had lent a hand so that the dishes could be prepared faster. After 30 minutes or so the food was ready and the couple enjoyed it in silence.  
没有说一句话，真嗣走进厨房，拿出一些食材开始烹饪。他打算做些酸菜和烤炸肉排。明日香帮忙加快了准备速度。大约 30 分钟后，食物准备好了，两人默默地享用着。

"Hmmm… that's so good Shinji," Asuka said after literally licking her plate clear, content expression on her face. "And now… I'm still kinda _hungry_ ." She stressed the last word and looked into Shinji's eyes with passion.  
“嗯……真嗣，太好吃了，”明日香舔干净盘子后满意地说道，脸上洋溢着满足的表情。“现在……我还是有点饿。”她强调了最后一个词，充满激情地看着真嗣的眼睛。

Shinji at first didn't understand what she meant; he thought she wanted to eat something else. However, looking into her eyes, he  
起初，真嗣不明白她的意思；他以为她想吃别的东西。然而，看着她的眼睛，他

realized she meant _that_ . "Ah… I'll wash the dishes first?"  
意识到她指的是这个。“啊……我先去洗碗？”

"Ooh, I think you forgot something, Shinji…" Asuka said, suddenly grabbing his wrist and pulled him over. "that you're MINE!"  
“哦，我想你忘了点什么，真嗣……”明日香突然抓住他的手腕，把他拉了过来。“你是我的！”

AN: ah, a relatively long chapter. Asuka deserves some highlight moments after everything I've put her through, doesn't she? Well, there will be more! Next chapter she had to blow her cover. See ya in  half a week.

I do not own Evangelion. Chapter 12: A Woman's Battle  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。第 12 章：女人的战斗

Asuka wandered aimlessly around a particular rural area in Germany. This place she had visited before when she was only 3 years old; her mother took her on a field trip there. They had a wonderful picnic; Asuka truly enjoyed that experience. It was one of the happiest moments in her life before her mother's absorption into Unit 02. She had always wanted to see her mother again inside Unit 02, however before she could get a proper chance the incident with Unit D happened, and she was forced to hide herself from NERV. She was becoming increasingly impatient with the whole hiding thing; she only wanted to spend more time with Shinji and see her mother again. Now thought, knowing NERV had changed the core of Unit 02 to match Hikari, the chance of seeing her mother again had become almost impossible. She simply wished her revelation to NERV could come earlier, but of course she didn't know what NERV would do to her. 'Probably dissect me or something,' Asuka thought. Sighing, she approached her destination. Asuka had been wearing some thick clothes, a hat, and sunglasses. Not only because of the weather - her S2 organ could produce enough heat to keep her warm, but also to hide herself from possible satellite scans after Shinji told her about it.  
明日香在德国的一个乡村地区漫无目的地徘徊。这个地方她曾在三岁时来过；那时她母亲带她来这里进行了一次实地考察。他们进行了一次美妙的野餐；明日香非常享受那次经历。那是她母亲被融入二号机之前，她生命中最快乐的时刻之一。她一直想在二号机里再次见到母亲，然而在她有机会之前，D 型机事件发生了，她被迫躲藏起来，远离 NERV。她对这种躲藏的生活越来越不耐烦；她只想和真嗣多相处一些时间，再次见到母亲。现在，得知 NERV 已经将二号机的核心改为与光匹配，再次见到母亲的机会几乎变得不可能了。她只是希望自己向 NERV 的揭露能早点到来，但她当然不知道 NERV 会怎么对待她。'可能会把我解剖什么的，'明日香想。叹了口气，她走向目的地。明日香穿着厚衣服，戴着帽子和太阳镜。 不仅因为天气——她的 S2 器官能产生足够的热量来保暖，还能在真嗣告诉她之后，帮助她躲避可能的卫星扫描。

The weather that day could only be described as impeccable for Asuka. Blue sky with scattered clouds, the wind was gentle and comforting. A comfortable 10 degrees Celsius temperature, although kinda low for ordinary people but effectively calms Asuka down from  
那天对明日香来说，天气只能用完美来形容。蓝天白云点缀，微风轻柔宜人。气温舒适，10 摄氏度虽对普通人来说有点低，却有效地让明日香从

all of her thoughts on recent events and frustration. Unable to be  
近来事件的思绪和挫败感中平静下来。无法被

with Shinji was casing her anxiety; she had never thought she could need someone so much before. She had lived a lonely life for almost 10 years which was filled with endless training and sync tests. She had been telling herself that she needed no one, and she had kept that mentality until she had met Kaji.  
与真嗣在一起缓解了她的焦虑；她从未想过自己会如此需要某个人。近十年来，她的生活孤独而单调，充斥着无休止的训练和同步测试。她一直告诉自己不需要任何人，直到遇见了加持。

Kaji had been so gentle and caring for her; his behavior had no second thought behind them; unlike most people at her same age, they only wanted to come near to her for their own selfish reasons; no one cared her for her only. Asuka knew it clearly, so she had pushed everyone away. Kaji was someone completely different; he cared for her without second thoughts because he saw her as his surrogate daughter. He was the closest person to be called a family in Asuka's eyes. Since Asuka had never experienced this kind of love ever since her mother died, and added the reason she wanted to grow up so that no one would see her as weak, she had naturally confused romantic love and her feelings toward Kaji. Now looking back, she could only laugh at her childish behaviors; she also knew that Kaji would never lay his hands on her, which was the main reason Asuka wasn't afraid to be physically close to Kaji.  
加持对她的温柔和关怀是如此自然而然，他的行为背后没有丝毫犹豫；不像她同龄的许多人，他们接近她只是出于自私的目的；没有人真正关心她。明日香对此心知肚明，因此她推开了所有人。加持与众不同；他无条件地关心她，因为他视她为替代女儿。在明日香眼中，他是唯一能称之为家人的存在。自从母亲去世后，明日香从未体验过这种爱，加之她渴望成长以避免被视为弱者，自然地将浪漫之爱与对加持的感情混淆了。如今回首，她只能嘲笑自己幼稚的行为；她也明白加持绝不会对她有非分之想，这也是明日香不惧怕与加持亲密接触的主要原因。

As for Shinji, he was another completely different type. At first Asuka thought Shinji was just another pervert like every boy at his age; he was also weak and coward, which Asuka hated the most. However living with him for so long she had learned that Shinji was nothing but gentle, kind, and caring. He was so modest to the extent that almost drove her insane. He dived into a volcano to save her against orders. No one had ever done anything like that before. It also made her realize although she didn't want any help, she needed it. Then she only wanted help from people who were better than her; as an EVA pilot and college graduate, it seemed like only Shinji in the whole world could fall into that category. Although he was still wimpy in daily life, the determination and courage he could show when inside an EVA amazed Asuka. Aside from his personality, their childhood traumas were so similar that they seemed like created from the same model. No one else in the world could ever understand what they've been through; not to mention piloting the  
至于真嗣，他则是另一种完全不同的类型。起初，明日香以为真嗣和同龄的男孩一样，不过是个变态；他还软弱且胆小，这是明日香最讨厌的特质。然而，与他共同生活了这么久，她发现真嗣其实无比温柔、善良且体贴。他谦逊得近乎让她抓狂。他违抗命令，跳入火山救她，这是前所未有的事。这也让她意识到，尽管她不希望得到帮助，但她确实需要。那时，她只愿接受比她强的人的帮助；作为 EVA 驾驶员和大学毕业生，似乎全世界只有真嗣能符合这一标准。尽管他在日常生活中依旧懦弱，但他在驾驶 EVA 时展现出的决心和勇气令明日香惊叹。除了性格，他们的童年创伤也如此相似，仿佛出自同一个模板。世界上再无人能真正理解他们所经历的一切；更不用说驾驶 EVA 了。

EVAs. So naturally their uncertain feelings toward each other soon became something much deeper. Even love wasn't enough to fully describe it; the two most broken persons found the other half that made them as a whole.  
EVA 驾驶员们。自然而然地，他们之间不确定的感情很快变得更为深厚。即便是爱也无法完全形容这种情感；两个最破碎的人找到了让彼此完整的另一半。

Asuka finally found the same tree she had had the picnic with her mother and father. Smiling, she laid down on the grass and stared at the sky. Forgetting about all uncertainties with the future, at that moment, she simply wanted to enjoy her life.  
明日香终于找到了那棵曾与父母一起野餐的树。她微笑着躺在草地上，凝视着天空。忘记了未来的一切不确定，那一刻，她只想享受生活。

However, this peacefulness was soon interrupted by a voice, a voice she immediately recognized from a person she loathed.  
然而，这份宁静很快被一个声音打破，一个她立刻从她所憎恨的人那里认出的声音。

"Yo, isn't that Soryu?" a male voice sounded, "hey guys, look at who's there?"  
“哟，那不是惣流吗？”一个男声响起，“嘿，伙计们，看看那是谁？”

Asuka frowned. She knew the person; his name was Otto, a bully from her college. She had absolutely zero interest in anyone in the college; she knew those boys wanted nothing but to get into women's panties. Although at that time she was only twelve years old, her body was developed enough for some of the males to look at her funny. Otto being one of them. He never had any chance to do anything, though. Aside from Asuka's awareness of personal safety, Section 2 had been keeping her away from any potential harm.  
明日香皱了皱眉。她认识这个人；他叫奥托，是她大学里的一个恶霸。她对大学里的任何人都没有丝毫兴趣；她知道那些男生除了想占女生便宜外别无所求。尽管那时她只有十二岁，但她的身体已经发育得足够让一些男生对她投以异样的目光。奥托就是其中之一。不过，他从未有机会做任何事情。除了明日香自身的安全意识外，第二支部也一直在保护她免受任何潜在伤害。

The group of males was approaching her slowly. 'Mein Gott how unlucky,' Asuka thought, 'do I have to come here and relax just to accidentally run into these morons? So fucking unfortunate.' She didn't have time to deal with the group of bullies, nor she wanted to. Asuka swiftly got up and began walking away.  
那群男生慢慢地向她逼近。“我的天，真倒霉，”明日香心想，“我来这里放松一下，居然还能碰上这些蠢货？真是太不幸了。”她没有时间和这群恶霸纠缠，也不想纠缠。明日香迅速起身，开始离开。

For Otto and his group of bullies it was a surprise for them as well; last time when he was trying to bug Soryu Section 2 had made sure he wouldn't even think about doing it again. However today he saw no one around in his peripheral vision; they were at a very open area and he could see no one else except Soryu and his' friends'. So he decided to take the chance. "Hey, where're ya goin, Soryu?" He eyed  
对于奥托和他的那帮恶霸来说，这也是一个意外；上次他试图骚扰惣流时，第二支部确保他连再想都不敢想。然而今天，他在视野范围内没看到任何人；他们在一个非常开阔的地方，除了惣流和他的'朋友们'，他看不到其他人。于是他决定抓住这个机会。“嘿，惣流，你要去哪儿？”他盯着

his companies who immediately understood his intentions and quickly formed a circle around Asuka.  
他的同伴们立刻明白了他的意图，迅速围成了一个圈，将明日香困在其中。

Asuka looked around her. Each one of the bullies was scanning her and it made her cringe. She hated these perverted gazes.  
明日香环顾四周。每一个恶霸都在打量她，这让她感到恶心。她讨厌这些猥琐的目光。

Otto walked closer to her, "Soryu where's your bodyguards heh? How about we have some fun together? You won't regret it…" He carried an evil grin when saying those words.  
奥托走近她，“惣流，你的保镖呢？嘿，不如我们一起找点乐子？你不会后悔的……”他说这些话时带着邪恶的笑容。

'What's this emotion I'm feeling right now?' Asuka thought. True to her thoughts, she wasn't feeling anything that a girl should feel under this type of situation; not hatred, not anger, not fear, not even flinch.  
“我现在感受到的这种情绪是什么？”明日香心想。正如她所想，在这种情境下，她并没有感受到一个女孩应有的情绪；没有仇恨，没有愤怒，没有恐惧，甚至连一丝颤抖都没有。

She felt _amusement._ 她感到的是一种乐趣。

"Leave me alone, so I promise you can go home alive," Asuka said coldly. In fact she was laughing internally. She'd never thought she could have a chance for revenge.  
“别烦我，我保证你能活着回家，”明日香冷冷地说道。实际上，她内心在窃笑。她从未想过自己能有复仇的机会。

The group of bullies first look at each other dumbfounded, then burst out laughing. "Very funny, Soryu. There're six of us one of you, and you're nothing but a helpless little girl…" Otto said, "Just make it easy for us so we won't hurt you so much…"  
那群恶霸先是面面相觑，愣住了，随即爆发出笑声。“真有趣，惣流。我们六个对一个，你不过是个无助的小女孩……”奥托说，“乖乖就范吧，这样我们不会让你太痛苦……”

Asuka sighed. Surely she could just disappear into Dirac sea but she couldn't leave any live witnesses. If she had to fight them it means she had to display her Angelic powers which also leads to the same situation. In fact, the moment they decided to come to her, they were sentenced to death. Asuka didn't want to kill anyone; although she had killed a lot of Angels, killing a person was still very difficult for her.  
明日香叹了口气。她当然可以消失在狄拉克海中，但她不能留下任何活口。如果她必须与他们战斗，那就意味着她必须展示她的使徒力量，这同样会导致相同的结果。事实上，他们决定来找她的那一刻，就已经被判了死刑。明日香并不想杀任何人；尽管她杀过很多使徒，但杀人对她来说仍然非常困难。

Asuka decided to just stand there and wait for them to make their first move. Then she would decide how to deal with them based on their actions.  
明日香决定就站在那里，等待他们先行动。然后她将根据他们的行为来决定如何应对。

A few seconds passed and Otto obviously started to lose patience. He didn't know why but he felt very uncomfortable with the atmosphere. Looking into Soryu's eyes he nearly flinched at the murderous look she held. But she was only a helpless girl, right?  
几秒钟过去了，奥托显然开始失去耐心。他不知道为什么，但这种气氛让他感到非常不舒服。看着惣流的眼神，他几乎被她眼中的杀意吓得退缩。但她不过是个无助的女孩，对吧？

Otto swallowed hard and summoned all his courage to walk in front of Soryu and tried to grab her arm.  
奥托艰难地咽了口唾沫，鼓起所有勇气走到惣流面前，试图抓住她的手臂。

Seeing there's no way out, Asuka had made her decision. 'Maybe I'll just beat this guy senseless and it will scare the rest off. This way I don't need to kill anybody and I can also get out of this.'  
眼看无路可逃，明日香做出了决定。'或许我可以把这个家伙打得失去意识，这样就能吓退其他人。这样我既不用杀人，也能脱身。'

Having Angelic powers also means faster reaction time and more sensitivity to surroundings. In her eyes Otto's movements were like slow motion. Asuka dodged his arm and turned her body around.  
拥有天使之力也意味着更快的反应速度和对周围环境更高的敏感度。在明日香眼中，奥托的动作如同慢动作一般。她轻松躲开他的手臂，转身面对他。

With the momentum, she delivered a roundhouse kick straight into Otto's lower abdomen. The speed of the kick was almost two times faster than professional martial artists thanks to her inhuman strength. Otto was sent flying backward and landed hard on his back 15 meters away. Blood poured out of his mouth.  
借助这股势头，她一记回旋踢直击奥托的下腹部。得益于她非人的力量，这一踢的速度几乎是职业武术家的两倍。奥托被踢得向后飞出，重重地摔在 15 米外的地上，口中鲜血直流。

The other five bullies fell silent for a minute, astonished. Maybe they were shocked by the fact that this seemingly helpless girl almost killed their leader in one kick, or they saw her eyes seemed to be glowing.  
其他五个恶霸一时哑然，惊愕不已。或许他们被这个看似无助的女孩一脚几乎踢死他们头领的事实所震撼，又或许他们看到了她的眼睛似乎在发光。

"You..you monster!" One of the bullies cried, suddenly pulled out a pistol and aimed at Asuka. Without hesitation he fired his gun and didn't stop until he emptied the whole magazine. Asuka assessed the trajectory of the bullets carefully. Four of them will miss her, five of them will hit her arms or legs. These she could deal with without using her AT-Field. She could heal the wounds pretty quickly after all. However the last buttle was coming straight for her head. She couldn't take the risk.  
“你……你这个怪物！”其中一个恶霸喊道，突然掏出手枪对准明日香。他毫不犹豫地开火，直到打空了整个弹匣。明日香仔细评估了子弹的轨迹。其中四颗会打偏，五颗会击中她的手臂或腿部。这些她可以不用 AT 力场处理，毕竟她能很快愈合伤口。然而，最后一颗子弹直奔她的头部而来。她不能冒险。

Within a fraction of a millisecond a flash of orange appeared in front of her, while all 10 bullets bounced off the invisible wall harmlessly. 'Great,' she thought, 'now my plan actually backfires at me.'  
在千分之一秒的瞬间，一抹橙色出现在她面前，而所有十颗子弹都无害地弹开了无形的墙壁。‘糟糕，’她心想，‘这下我的计划反而适得其反了。’

"Wha-what a-are you?" Another bully stammered out. He was the only one still standing; every other bully had already fallen to the ground, their eyes widened in fear.  
“什、什么人？”另一个恶霸结巴着问道。他是唯一还站着的；其他恶霸都已经倒在地上，眼中满是恐惧。

"I told you to leave me alone," Asuka said in an indifferent tone, "now you've left me no choice." Asuka had never spoken like this; she was surprised by herself. Shaking her head to get rid of her thoughts, she decided at least she could give these morons some fair treatment while preventing them from saying anything to the outside world.  
“我告诉过你们别来烦我，”明日香用一种冷漠的语气说道，“现在你们逼我别无选择。”明日香从未这样说过话；她对自己感到惊讶。她摇摇头，甩开这些思绪，决定至少可以公平对待这些蠢货，同时防止他们对外界透露任何信息。

It's only been two days after the fight with Bardiel; NERV was still busy trying to clean up the battlefield. They managed to recover Unit 03's core but the EVA was damaged so badly that it would be out of the roster for a very long time. Misato sat in front of a row of monitors that surveillance the world for anomalies.  
与巴迪尔的战斗才过去两天；NERV 仍在忙于清理战场。他们设法回收了三号机的核心，但 EVA 受损严重，将长时间无法投入使用。美里坐在一排监视全球异常情况的显示器前。

Just as she was about to drift into sleep after staring at the screen for 2 hours, an alarm went off. Misato jerked her head up; her sleepiness was gone completely. "What is it?" She shouted, "What's wrong?"  
就在她盯着屏幕两小时后即将陷入睡眠时，警报突然响起。美里猛地抬起头，睡意全无。“怎么了？”她大喊，“出什么事了？”

"Major, we've detected a pattern orange!" Makoto reported, "and… weird." He paused for a second, "It's in Germany."  
“少校，我们检测到一个橙色信号！”真琴报告道，“而且……很奇怪。”他停顿了一下，“在德国。”

"Huh? Are you sure?" Misato felt confused. Only Angels or EVAs could appear as pattern orange, and until now every single Angel had appeared near Tokyo-3 or heading for it. So if it was not an Angel, is it possible that Germany was secretly developing some new type of unregistered EVA unit?  
“啊？你确定吗？”美里感到困惑。只有使徒或 EVA 才会显示为橙色信号，而迄今为止，每一个使徒都出现在第三新东京市附近或朝其进发。所以如果不是使徒，难道德国在秘密研发某种未注册的新型 EVA 单位？

"Yes, ma'am," Makoto said, "Oryx 103 is scanning the area."  
“是的，女士，”真琴说，“Oryx 103 正在扫描该区域。”

The satellite image was being transferred to the screen. On the image it showed a bloody corpse lying face up on the ground.  
卫星图像正在传输到屏幕上。图像显示一具血淋淋的尸体仰面躺在地上。

Everyone gasped at the sight. "Pattern orange disappeared." Makoto  
看到这一幕，所有人都倒吸了一口凉气。“橙色模式消失了。”真琴

said.

"Do we have recordings?" Misato asked.  
"我们有录音吗？" 美里问道。

"Yes, ma'am. Bringing up recordings." The recorded video had a much worse quality since the satellite had limited storage, and even so only 30 seconds of videos could be kept and anything earlier than that was deleted.  
"是的，长官。正在调取录音。" 由于卫星存储有限，录制的视频质量差得多，而且只能保留 30 秒的视频，更早的内容已被删除。

From the video one could only see seven distinct figures. One lying on the ground and one were dragging the other five to the same place. Then the six of them disappeared simultaneously, leaving the man lying on the ground slowly bled to death.  
从视频中只能看到七个不同的身影。一个躺在地上，另一个拖着其他五个人到同一个地方。然后六个人同时消失，留下躺在地上的人慢慢流血至死。

"Wha-what happened?" Misato asked, her right hand covering her mouth. She had no idea of what she saw, but one thing was certain that it was some kind of supernatural power. Just as she was wandering in her own thoughts, the Angel alarm sounded.  
"发-发生了什么？" 美里问道，右手捂住嘴巴。她对所见一无所知，但可以肯定的是，那是一种超自然的力量。正当她在自己的思绪中徘徊时，天使警报响起了。

"Pattern Blue confirmed!" Aoba shouted, "It's an Angel!"  
"确认蓝色模式！" 青叶喊道，"是天使！"

Naturally people on the command deck thought it had something to do with the pattern orange before. "Where're our pilots?" Misato forced her to suppress her thoughts, "what's the location of the Angel?"  
自然而然地，指挥舱里的人们认为这与之前的橙色模式有关。"我们的驾驶员在哪里？" 美里强迫自己压制住思绪，"天使的位置在哪里？"

"The Angel had already breached Gora Absolute Defense Line!" Makoto reported, "It's coming towards the Geofront!"  
"天使已经突破了戈拉绝对防御线！" 真琴报告道，"它正朝地底都市前进！"

"Holy shit! Its AT-Field Strength is breaking the roof!" Aoba yelled.  
"我靠！它的 AT 力场强度正在掀翻屋顶！" 青叶喊道。

"Damn it! Where's Shinji and Rei?" Misato demanded, "We need the EVAs deployed, right now!"  
"该死！真嗣和丽在哪里？" 美里急切地问，"我们需要 EVA 立刻出击！"

Shinji had been anticipating the attack, so he had already changed into his plug suit. Rei on the other hand was still lying in her hospital bed, still recovering from phantom pain. "We've located the Third Child! He just came out from the changing room and heading  
"真嗣早已预料到这次攻击，因此他已换上了插入栓服。而另一方面，绫波仍躺在医院病床上，仍在从幻痛中恢复。“我们已定位到第三适格者！他刚从更衣室出来，正朝……”

towards EVA cages!" "朝 EVA 机库方向前进！”

Considering the events occurring on the surface, Misato found the Command Center to be strangely in order, albeit very tense. Every single one of the technicians were doing their job with precise expertise, demonstrating why they had achieved such a high position in NERV. "OH MY GOD!" Aoba called. "The Angel took out eighteen layers of armour in one shot! It's only be a matter of time until it breaches the GeoFront!"  
"考虑到地表发生的事件，美里发现指挥中心异常井然有序，尽管气氛非常紧张。每一位技术人员都以精准的专业技能履行职责，这正是他们在 NERV 中获得如此高地位的原因。“我的天啊！”青叶喊道，“使徒一击就摧毁了十八层装甲！它突破地底都市只是时间问题！”

"Shit." Misato hissed, looking at the screen of Hyuga's terminal. "We won't have time to get Unit D onto the surface in time. Send him to the GeoFront. She'll have to confront the Angel in front of Headquarters!"  
"该死。" 美里咬牙切齿地盯着日向的终端屏幕。"我们来不及把 D 型机送上地面了。让他去地底都市。她必须在总部前迎战使徒！"

"Roger." He replied, punching in a code to set the EVA's destination. Once Shinji had activated Unit D, he slammed down on the red button of his terminal, shooting the Crimson-Purple-ish Evangelion from the cages into a series of shafts until it finally emerged in front of the pyramid, the iconic symbol that NERV had become so closely associated with.  
"收到。" 他回应道，输入代码设定 EVA 的目的地。一旦真嗣启动了 D 型机，他猛地按下终端上的红色按钮，将那台深红紫色的福音战士从笼中射入一系列通道，最终在金字塔前现身，这座标志已成为 NERV 的象征。

Suddenly there was a loud rumbling sound that came from the surface, which could even be heard from the depths of Central Dogma, causing the entire Command Center to shake violently. Everyone looked around at one another, trying to find the source of the sudden tremor, only for Aoba to announce it to everyone. "The Angel has breached the GeoFront!" He exclaimed, his eyes wide. "It's making its way towards Headquarters!"  
突然，从地面传来一阵巨大的轰鸣声，即便在中央教条深处也能听见，整个指挥中心剧烈摇晃。众人面面相觑，试图找出震动的源头，结果是青叶向大家宣布："使徒已经突破地底都市！" 他惊呼，双眼圆睁。"它正朝总部逼近！"

"Fuck!" Misato looked up at the giant holographic projection of the GeoFront hovering before the entire Command Center, spotting the blue dot near the top of the hologram slowly making its way down to the red one at the bottom. "What's the situation with Unit 00? Can we use the Dummy Plug system?!" She kept her eyes on the hologram. "I don't want Shinji fighting that thing alone!"  
"该死！" 美里抬头看着悬浮在整个指挥中心前的巨大全息投影，那是地底都市的影像，她注意到蓝色光点在全息图顶部缓缓向底部红色光点移动。"零号机的状况如何？我们能使用模拟插入栓系统吗？！" 她紧盯着全息图。"我不希望真嗣独自对抗那东西！"

"Not good! Unit 00 is rejecting the Dummy Plug!" Aoba said.  
"不妙！零号机正在排斥模拟插入栓！" 青叶报告道。

"Shit! Not now of all this time!" Misato cursed, "Shinji! What's your status!"  
"该死！偏偏在这个时候！" 美里咒骂道，"真嗣！你的状况如何！"

"I'm ready!" Shinji's voice came from the comms, while grabbing a multi-barrel gatling gun aiming at the descending Angel. Without hesitation he pulled the trigger. A rain of armour piercing shells flew at near sonic speed toward the Angel, each bouncing helplessly off its AT-Field. Shinji had already expected this. With a frustrated groan he dropped the gun and sprinted toward it. Pulling out his prog knife at the same time Shinji summoned an AT-Field trying to erode the Angel's. He didn't know how strong an AT-Field Unit D could produce but there were no other options.  
"我准备好了！" 真嗣的声音从通讯器中传来，同时他抓起一把多管加特林枪瞄准正在下降的使徒。毫不犹豫地扣动扳机，一连串的穿甲弹以接近音速射向使徒，但每一发都无奈地被其 AT 力场弹开。真嗣早已预料到这一点。他懊恼地哼了一声，丢下枪，向使徒冲去。同时拔出他的程序刀，真嗣召唤出 AT 力场试图侵蚀使徒的力场。他不知道 D 型机能够产生多强的 AT 力场，但没有其他选择。

The Angel's eyes flashed red, Shinji quickly ducked to the side, still took a good hit of the blast. Unit D was sent flying backward and crashed down on the ground. Groaning in pain, Shinji willed Unit D to stand up. The Angel folded its ribbon like arms, and they shot forward in blinding speed. Having expected the attack, Shinji made a sidestep and the EVA managed to dodge the deadly attack by mere meters.  
使徒的眼睛闪烁着红光，真嗣迅速侧身躲避，但仍被爆炸的冲击击中。D 型机被击飞向后，重重地摔在地上。真嗣痛苦地呻吟着，命令 D 型机站起来。使徒将其带状的手臂折叠起来，然后以惊人的速度向前射出。预料到这一攻击，真嗣侧身一闪，EVA 险之又险地躲过了致命一击，仅差几米。

Seeing this as his chance, Shinji tried to grab one of its arms. However the Angel reacted faster and retreated them while slicing several fingers off Unit D's right hand. Shinji cried in pain as he felt exactly what the EVA felt. He needed to fight with more caution and less recklessness.  
看到这个机会，真嗣试图抓住其中一条手臂。然而使徒反应更快，迅速后退并切断了 D 型机右手上的几根手指。真嗣因疼痛而大叫，他能感受到 EVA 所感受到的一切。他需要更加谨慎，减少鲁莽行为。

"Send Rei out in Unit 00." Gendo ordered. Misato's head reared back at her superior. "But Unit 00 isn't fully repaired yet! It's still missing its left arm, and the right one hasn't even fully regenerated yet!"  
“派出零号机里的绫波。”源堂命令道。美里惊讶地抬头看向她的上司。“但零号机还没有完全修复！它还缺少左臂，右臂也尚未完全再生！”

"I'm aware of this." The Commander replied. "But we don't have any other options, unless you want to send the Fifth Child into the battle."  
“我清楚这一点。”指挥官回答，“但我们别无选择，除非你想让第五适格者投入战斗。”

The lavender haired woman growled under her breath, feeling the need to protest his orders. Sending Hikari into the battle was not much different from telling her to suicide.  
紫发女子低声咆哮，感到有必要抗议他的命令。让光进入战场无异于让她去送死。

"It's okay." A ghostly voice came from Maya's terminal, catching the Major's attention. "I can be replaced if need be."  
“没关系。”一个幽灵般的声音从真嗣的终端传来，引起了美里的注意。“如果有必要，我可以被替换。”

Misato felt a hollowness in her chest upon hearing the girl's rather bleak words. However the adrenaline kept her moving and kept her from dwelling on Rei's choice to face the Angel with such a severe handicap. "Fine." She conceded. "But please try not to get yourself killed, okay?"  
听到女孩这番颇为悲观的话，美里感到胸口一阵空虚。然而肾上腺素让她继续行动，让她无法深思丽选择以如此严重的劣势面对使徒的决定。“好吧。”她让步道，“但请尽量不要让自己丧命，好吗？”

"Roger." Her voice sounded weak.  
“罗杰。”她的声音听起来很虚弱。

Outside the NERV HQ, Shinji was struggling to dodge the Angel's deadly attacks, while getting closer and closer to his target. Seeing the eyes of the Angel lit up again, he dashed forward to dodge the blast while closing his distance with it. The Angel rose its silver ribbons again, this time taking aim at Unit D's head. With his Angelic instincts and his synch ratio at its peak, Shinji ducked down just in the nick of time to avoid the potentially fatal blow, and continued his charge. By the time the Angel was able to retract its arms, Unit D was already within the range to successfully weaken its AT-Field.  
在 NERV 总部外，真嗣正努力躲避使徒的致命攻击，同时越来越接近他的目标。看到使徒的眼睛再次亮起，他向前冲去躲避爆炸，同时缩短与它的距离。使徒再次升起银色缎带，这次瞄准了 D 型机的头部。凭借天使般的本能和同步率处于巅峰状态，真嗣在千钧一发之际蹲下，避开了可能致命的一击，并继续冲锋。当使徒能够收回手臂时，D 型机已经进入了成功削弱其 AT 力场的范围。

Pulling up his prog knife, Shinji summoned all of his strength and stab it down on the Angel, aiming to the core. The Angel increased its AT-Field strength just in time to block the blow. However it knew the AT-Field wouldn't hold long. Taking advantage of Shinji's lack of attention to his surroundings since he was focused on his knife and AT-Field, the Angel shot its arms toward Unit D's legs, successfully slicing off its left leg, and badly damaged the right.  
真嗣拔出他的程序刀，集中所有力量向使徒的核心刺去。使徒及时增强了 AT 力场强度以阻挡这一击。然而它知道 AT 力场不会持久。利用真嗣因专注于刀和 AT 力场而忽视周围环境的空隙，使徒向 D 型机的腿部射出手臂，成功切断了左腿，并严重损坏了右腿。

Shinji screamed in pain and let go of the knife. The Angel gave him no time to catch his breath and retracted its arms; during the process the bottom two arms of Unit D - the two Shinji was controlling - were also sliced off.  
真嗣痛苦地尖叫着，放开了刀。使徒没有给他喘息的机会，收回了它的手臂；在这个过程中，D 型机底部的那两只手臂——真嗣控制的那两只——也被切断了。

Due to the high sync ratio the pain was unbearable. Shinji almost passed out from it and was using all his willpower to stay focused. The Angel continued its assault; grabbing the right leg of Unit D, it swung the EVA away. Unit D flew off several hundred meters and almost crashed against NERV HQ.  
由于同步率过高，疼痛难以忍受。真嗣几乎因此昏厥，他用尽所有意志力保持专注。使徒继续它的攻击；抓住 D 型机的右腿，将其甩飞。D 型机飞出数百米，差点撞上 NERV 总部。

"Arghhhh…" Shinji groaned in pain; then he saw an almost armless Unit 00 with only part of its right arm regenerated. It's holding a black cylindrical object in its hands.  
“啊……”真嗣痛苦地呻吟着；然后他看到几乎失去双臂的 00 号机，只有右臂部分再生。它手中握着一个黑色的圆柱形物体。

Inside of Unit 00's Entry Plug, Rei bravely charged Unit 00 forward, keeping the N2 mine tucked as close to her as possible. The cockpit quickly became filled with objections from the crew members inside of the Command Center, seeing what she was doing. However, the blue haired girl ignored all their qualms, pressing forward anyways. Even if she died in all this, then at least she could die knowing that she saved Shinji, the person who had shown her true kindness. The Angel rose up its silver ribbons again, shooting them towards Unit 00, only for it to sidestep both of attacks.  
在零号机的插入栓内，绫波勇敢地驾驶着零号机向前冲去，尽可能地将 N2 地雷紧贴在自己身边。驾驶舱内很快充满了指挥中心内工作人员的反对声，他们看到了她的行动。然而，蓝发少女无视了他们所有的顾虑，依然坚定地前进。即使她在这场战斗中牺牲，至少她能带着救了真嗣——那个向她展示真正善意的人——的信念死去。天使再次升起它的银色缎带，向零号机射去，却被零号机巧妙地避开了这两次攻击。

As Unit 00 drew closer to the Angel, it quickly attempted to raise its AT-Field. Unable to hold Unit 00 back, it quickly started to lower the shield over its damaged core to cover itself from Unit 00's suicide attack as it tackled the Angel, placing the N2 mine as close to its core as possible. The moment before the mine made contact with the core the Angel closed the eyelid like armour around it. Rei kept the explosion confined into a smaller area using her own AT Field, keeping all of the civilians, as well as those in NERV Headquarters safe from the blast.  
当零号机接近天使时，它迅速试图升起 AT 力场。无法阻挡零号机的逼近，它迅速开始降低覆盖其受损核心的护盾，以保护自己免受零号机自杀式攻击的伤害，零号机猛扑向天使，将 N2 地雷尽可能靠近其核心放置。在地雷接触核心的瞬间，天使像闭上眼睑般的装甲围绕其核心闭合。绫波利用自己的 AT 力场将爆炸限制在一个较小的区域内，确保所有平民以及 NERV 总部内的人员免受爆炸波及。

"Rei!" Shinji screamed, running towards the explosion. Once the dust settled, Unit 00 remained barely standing, its armor severely burnt and damaged. The Angel on the other hand still stood strong, its body unharmed by the suicide attack. However its core now looked like it was just one good hit away from shattering completely.  
“丽！”真嗣尖叫着，向爆炸处奔去。尘埃落定后，零号机勉强站立，装甲严重烧毁和损坏。而使徒那边依然屹立不倒，身体未受自杀式攻击的影响。然而其核心现在看起来只需一击便可能彻底破碎。

Leaving all other five unconscious bullies on a remote island, Asuka felt satisfied with her decision and entered her Dirac sea. She was worried about the fight with Z eruel. It was one of the most powerful Angels; although she trusted Shinji could handle it just fine, she couldn't help but wanted to check on the battle. She knew it would be risky that she could be discovered, but it would be worth it if she could actually do something to help Shinji.  
将其他五个昏迷的恶霸留在偏远岛屿上，明日香对自己的决定感到满意，并进入了狄拉克海。她对与 Zeruel 的战斗感到担忧。这是最强大的使徒之一；尽管她相信真嗣能妥善处理，但她忍不住想要查看战况。她知道这很冒险，可能会被发现，但如果能实际帮助到真嗣，这一切都是值得的。

The Angel ignored the motionless Unit 00 and floated towards Unit  
使徒无视了静止不动的零号机，飘向初号机

D. Standing in front of the helpless EVA, the Angel rose one of its ribbon arms up to Unit D's face and took hold of it by completely wrapping up its head before tossing it onto the side of the pyramid. With Unit D down, the Angel rose up from the ground and began to hover towards its opponent. After taking a moment to examine the Evangelion, it shot a ribbon forward, slicing the chest plate off of the EVA, exposing a glowing red core in its lower abdomen.  
D 型机站在无助的 EVA 面前，天使将其一条缎带手臂举至 D 型机的脸部，完全包裹住其头部后将其甩向金字塔的一侧。随着 D 型机倒下，天使从地面升起，开始向对手悬浮前进。在仔细观察了 EVA 之后，它射出一条缎带，切开了胸甲，露出了下腹部的红色发光核心。

"Oh no…" Dr. Akagi held her hand over her mouth. "It's exposed the core!" Misato shrieked. "It's going to destroy Unit D!"  
“哦不…”赤木博士用手捂住嘴。“它暴露了核心！”美里尖叫道。“它要摧毁 D 型机了！”

As if on cue, the Angel began shooting its ribbon arms forward in succession, aiming each hit for Unit 01's core. Each hit made the giant mech tremble as the cracks on its core grew more and more prominent until the cracks began to turn into fissures. There was no way that it would be able to withstand any more punishment before breaking, at which point Unit D would be lost forever.  
仿佛是按了开关，天使开始连续发射其缎带手臂，每一击都瞄准了 01 型机的核心。每一次打击都让巨型机甲颤抖，核心上的裂缝越来越明显，直到裂缝开始变成裂隙。在破碎之前，它无法再承受更多的伤害，届时 D 型机将永远消失。

Shinji couldn't do anything with the two bottom arms severed and two legs severed or damaged. He closed his eyes as the cracks began spreading across his entry plug. 'I'm sorry Asuka,' he thought, 'It seems like I can't keep my promise…'  
真嗣的两只下臂被切断，两条腿也断掉或受损，他无能为力。当裂缝开始在插入栓上蔓延时，他闭上了眼睛。'对不起，明日香，'他心想，'看来我无法遵守承诺了……'

Just as the supposed final blow was about to hit Unit D's core, the two upper arms suddenly reached out and blocked the final strike from its opponent. With its powerful AT-Field, the ribbon was sliced to bits by Unit D's fingers, without so much as damaging the Evangelion in the slightest. It then took hold of the ribbon in a tight grasp and jerked the Angel towards it, bringing its skeletal face nose to nose with it.  
就在看似最后一击即将命中 D 型机的核心时，两只上臂突然伸出，挡住了对手的致命一击。凭借其强大的 AT 力场，D 型机用手指将带状物切成了碎片，丝毫未损及自身。随后，它紧紧抓住带状物，猛地将天使拉向自己，使其骷髅般的面孔与自己鼻尖相对。

The Angel felt fear. It didn't like the feeling.  
天使感受到了恐惧。它不喜欢这种感觉。

"What happened?!" Misato asked, "how did the upper arms move  
“发生了什么？！”美里问道，“上臂是如何移动的？”

without a pilot in the left entry plug?"  
在没有驾驶员进入左侧插入栓的情况下？

"Actually…" Makoto said, "we've detected life signs in the left entry  
“实际上……”真琴说，“我们在左侧插入栓中检测到了生命迹象。”

plug."

"How possible? Did Shinji move into the left plug?"  
"有多可能？难道真嗣移到了左边的插入栓？"

"No, ma'am." Maya said, her voice slightly trembling as she looked at the video feed, "its… its…"  
"不，女士。" 玛雅说道，她的声音微微颤抖，目光紧盯着视频画面，"它…它…"

Everyone watched in awe as Maya brought up the video feed to the main screen.  
众人惊叹地看着玛雅将视频画面调至主屏幕。

Red hair. Blue eyes. Slim body. No doubt it's her.  
红发。蓝眼。苗条身形。毫无疑问，就是她。

_"Shinji! Shinji! Are you okay! Answer me damn it! "_ The familiar voice came from the comms.  
"真嗣！真嗣！你还好吗！回答我，该死的！" 通讯器里传来熟悉的声音。

"ASUKA!" Misato shouted first as the realization came down on her, "but… how?"  
"明日香！" 美里首先喊道，当意识到这一点时，"但是……怎么回事？"

Unit D pushed the Angel down and began slamming its fists into its core. The core cracked more. Slam. Slam. Slam. Crack. However the gigantic humanoid suddenly stopped moving just as the supposed final blow was about to hit.  
D 单位将使徒按倒在地，开始用拳头猛击其核心。核心裂纹越来越多。砰。砰。砰。裂开。然而，就在即将给予所谓致命一击的时刻，那巨大的类人形突然停止了动作。

The power had run out.  
能量耗尽了。

"No no no no no!" Asuka cried, as she shook the control yoke violently, "not now! God damn move you stupid thing!"  
“不不不不不！”明日香哭喊着，疯狂地摇晃着操纵杆，“别现在！该死的动起来，你这蠢东西！”

The Angel remained motionless for a moment, as if wondering why its opponent stopped attacking. Realizing that now was a prime opportunity to take the offensive, it quickly regained its balance and floated up.  
天使静止不动片刻，仿佛在疑惑为何对手停止了攻击。意识到现在是发起进攻的绝佳时机，它迅速恢复平衡并飘浮起来。

The people on the command deck were so confused as so many things happened in such a short period of time. At first it was the feeling of dread as they thought Unit D was about to be destroyed. Then it's the confusion of a supposedly dead Asuka's appearance.  
指挥甲板上的人们感到极度困惑，因为短时间内发生了太多事情。起初是以为 D 型机即将被摧毁的恐惧感，接着是本应死去的明日香出现的困惑。

Just as they were to get their hopes up, Unit D ran out of power. Now they simply didn't know what to feel anymore.  
正当他们要重燃希望时，D 型机却耗尽了能量。现在他们已经不知道该作何感想了。

"No!" Katsuragi screamed. "This can't be happening!" "Wait!" Ritsuko said, "Unit D reactivated!"  
“不！” 葛城尖叫道，“这不可能发生！” “等等！” 律子说，“D 单位重新启动了！”

True to her words, Unit D's eyes lit up once again. "But how?" "It's using the S2 organ!"  
正如她所说，D 单位的眼睛再次亮起。“但怎么可能？”“它在使用 S2 器官！”

Misato was dumbstruck. "how did it get an S2 organ? Germany didn't…"  
美里目瞪口呆。“它是怎么得到 S2 器官的？德国并没有…”

"It was Ireul," Ritsuko said calmly, "during the time when Ireul possessed Unit D, it must've grown an S2 organ inside it."  
"是 Ireul，" 律子平静地说，"在 Ireul 控制 D 型单位期间，它一定在其内部生长出了 S2 器官。"

Inside the left entry plug Asuka suddenly felt a surge of power through her body. The Angel's eyes lit up again. However the energy beam was blocked fully by Unit D's exponentially more powerful AT- Field. With a vicious swing of the arm, the Angel was almost cut in half with its AT-Field shattered like thin paper, and the core finally gave in.  
在左边的插入栓内，明日香突然感到一股力量贯穿全身。使徒的眼睛再次亮起。然而，能量光束被 D 型单位更为强大的 AT 力场完全阻挡。随着手臂猛烈一挥，使徒几乎被切成两半，其 AT 力场如薄纸般破碎，核心最终屈服。

The Angel exploded into a ball of fire while Unit D held its AT-Field to protect the people inside Geofront.  
使徒爆炸成一团火球，而 D 型单位则维持其 AT 力场，保护着 Geofront 内的人们。

Shinji finally felt his pain subsided to a bearable level, and looked around him. His entry plug was still intact albeit the multiple cracks spread across it. Looking at the left side he saw…  
真嗣终于感到疼痛减轻到了可忍受的程度，环顾四周。他的插入栓虽然布满了裂痕，但依然完好无损。他向左边看去，看到了……

"Asuka!" Shinji exclaimed, "you… I…"  
“明日香！” 真嗣惊呼，“你……我……”

"yes I saved your sorry ass dummkopf," Asuka said rather angrily, "and now they all saw me! This is all your fault! If you'd defeat the Angel I didn't have to expose myself!"  
“没错，我救了你这个笨蛋，”明日香相当生气地说，“现在所有人都看到了我！这都是你的错！如果你能打败使徒，我就不用暴露自己了！”

"Sorry," Shinji said, "but I'm just glad… I thought I was gonna die…"  
"对不起，" 真嗣说，"但我只是很高兴……我以为我要死了……"

"Hmph, you're not dying on my watch, Baka. And you promised never to leave me, remember?"  
"哼，在我眼皮底下你死不了，笨蛋。你还答应过永远不会离开我，记得吗？"

Shinji let out a soft chuckle, "yes ma'am…" Shinji felt like sleeping as the adrenaline left his veins, and he passed out easily despite the shouting from the redhead.  
真嗣轻声笑了笑，"是的，女士……" 随着肾上腺素从血管中消退，真嗣感到困倦，尽管红发女孩在喊叫，他还是轻易地昏睡过去了。

Asuka sighed heavily. 'Now I'll have to deal with NERV great. I wonder if I can make up a believable lie?' The entry plug ejected and the hatch was opened. She was still wearing the sweatshirt and it was soaked with LCL. She needed a shower hurriedly. However the moment she stepped out the entry plug she was pointed by at least 10 lasers shooting from MP5 submachine guns. "Pilot Soryu," one of the soldiers said, "You're under custody. Please come with us."  
明日香重重地叹了口气。'现在我得应付 NERV 那帮人了。不知道能不能编出一个可信的谎言？'插入栓弹出，舱门打开。她仍穿着那件运动衫，已被 LCL 浸透。她急需冲个澡。然而，她刚踏出插入栓，至少十道激光便从 MP5 冲锋枪中射出，指向她。“Soryu 驾驶员，”一名士兵说道，“你被拘留了。请跟我们走。”

A group of investigators and doctors from NERV Berlin came to the sight of the last pattern orange. They took samples from the body and examined the surroundings.  
一群来自 NERV 柏林的调查员和医生来到最后一个橙色模式的现场。他们从尸体上取样，并检查了周围环境。

Misato walked hurriedly down the hallway to the First Cranial Nerve ward that Asuka was in, fighting back her tears. She had called Kaji who was watering his melons and now hurrying to NERV HQ as well. It was Ritsuko who gave the recommendation to lock Asuka down and keep her sedated and the Commander had approved it. The Commander's head almost fell off his clasped hands the moment he saw the video feed showing Asuka inside the entry plug. This girl never ceased to surprise people, right?  
美里匆匆走过走廊，前往明日香所在的第一颅神经病房，强忍着泪水。她已经联系了正在浇瓜的加持，他现在也正急忙赶往 NERV 总部。是律子建议将明日香隔离并保持镇静，指挥官也批准了这一建议。指挥官看到显示明日香在插入栓内的视频画面时，他的头几乎要从紧握的双手中掉下来。这女孩总是让人意想不到，对吧？

Looking into the ward Asuka was restrained to the bed, her clothes were changed into a hospital gown. "Asuka! Are you awake?" Misato called out. Asuka showed no signs of recognition as she was still sedated heavily; the only sign showing her alive were the beeps of the machines monitoring her vitals.  
透过病房门，可以看到明日香被固定在床上，她的衣服已被换成医院的病号服。“明日香！你醒着吗？”美里呼唤道。明日香毫无反应，显然还处于深度镇静状态；唯一显示她生命迹象的，是监测她生命体征的机器发出的哔哔声。

"I'm… glad to see you okay," Misato paused for a few seconds since she couldn't know whether she was more shocked or happy to see  
“我……很高兴看到你安然无恙，”美里停顿了几秒，因为她不知道自己见到

her alive and well. "I'm telling Shinji…"  
她安然无恙时，是更震惊还是更高兴。“我要告诉真嗣……”

"No." Ritsuko suddenly appeared and snapped Misato, "there's no way she could just come back like this. Don't forget this is the second time she came back from death. The only reason I can think of is…"  
"不。" 律子突然出现，厉声对美里说，"她不可能就这样回来的。别忘了，这是她第二次从死亡中归来。我能想到的唯一原因是……"

"I don't give a fuck about your theories!" Misato cried, anger surging through her body, "I just want my kids back!"  
"我才不在乎你的理论！" 美里哭喊着，怒火在她体内翻涌，"我只想让我的孩子们回来！"

"Even if she's an Angel?"  
"即使她是使徒？"

"NO! SHE'S NOT AN ANGEL!"  
"不！她不是天使！"

Ritsuko shook her head, "Major, you really need to think rationally instead of letting emotions take over you." She took out her PDA and handed it to Misato, "remember the pattern orange we discovered just before the fight with Z eruel?" Seeing Misato nodding, she continued, "they extracted DNA traces that match Asuka's perfectly around the area. And now she's here. The whole thing just doesn't make any sense."  
律子摇了摇头，"少校，你真的需要理性思考，而不是让情绪主导你。"她拿出 PDA 递给美里，"还记得我们在与零号机战斗前发现的橙色模式吗？"看到美里点头，她继续说道，"他们在那一带提取到了与明日香完全匹配的 DNA 痕迹。而现在她就在这里。这一切都说不通。"

"But the reality is she's now here alive and well, right?" Misato was surprised to see the report, but kept her composure nonetheless, "I'd say we'll just accept it. Like Shinji does."  
"但现实是她现在活生生地在这里，对吧？"美里对这份报告感到惊讶，但仍保持镇定，"我想我们应该接受这个事实。就像真嗣那样。"

"Not before I ran some tests on her." Ritsuko said, seeing Misato's eyes twitched she added, "I'm not going to dissect her or something. At least she'll be a valuable specimen to us."  
"在我对她进行一些测试之前，不行。" 律子说，注意到美里眼角一跳，她补充道，"我不会把她解剖什么的。至少她对我们来说会是一个有价值的样本。"

"I'm not letting you touch my kid, Doctor!" Misato was practically fuming, "I'll kill you if you dare do any harm to her!"  
"我不会让你碰我的孩子，医生！" 美里几乎是在咆哮，"如果你敢伤害她，我会杀了你！"

Ritsuko signed. "Fine. At least let me do some physical examination and a full brain scan."  
律子叹了口气。"好吧。至少让我做一下身体检查和全面脑部扫描。"

"M-Misato-san!" Shinji's voice suddenly came from the end of the hallway. Running towards her Shinji said, "I-I-wanna see Asuka!"  
"M-美里小姐！" 真嗣的声音突然从走廊尽头传来。他跑向她，说道："我-我-想见明日香！"

"Shinji calm down, she's unconscious cuz she's sedated," Misato said, "it's for… safety measures."  
"真嗣，冷静点，她因为被镇静剂弄得昏迷了，" 美里说，"这是为了……安全措施。"

Although Shinji knew Asuka was okay, he still wanted to make sure NERV didn't do any harm on her after she was locked down. Seeing Asuka lying on the bed peacefully, although restrained, Shinji let out a sigh of relief. "M-Misato-san, what are you going to do to her? Why the restraints?"  
尽管真嗣知道明日香没事，但他仍然想确认 NERV 在她被隔离后没有对她造成任何伤害。看到明日香平静地躺在床上，虽然被束缚着，真嗣松了一口气。"M-美里小姐，你们打算对她做什么？为什么要绑着她？"

"For now just some physical checks and brain scans. As for the restraint…" Misato paused for a few seconds and sighed, "we… believe she exhibited supernatural powers and we had to take precautions."  
"目前只是进行一些身体检查和脑部扫描。至于限制措施……" 美里停顿了几秒，叹了口气，"我们……认为她展现出了超自然力量，不得不采取预防措施。"

Of course Shinji knew what those 'supernatural powers' meant. He knew Asuka appeared in the entry plug from nowhere while everybody else thought she was dead. It seemed like he needed to tell Misato the truth sooner than later.  
当然，真嗣知道那些'超自然力量'意味着什么。他知道明日香是从无到有出现在插入栓里的，而其他人以为她已经死了。看来他需要尽快告诉美里真相。

"I believe the scenario is being threatened, Ikari. The Second Child was not meant to be an Angel. We don't know how things will move on from now on. I need you to take drastic actions to ensure the progression of the scenario." Whenever Keel Lorenz held a private meeting with him he knew something must be very wrong.  
"我认为局势正受到威胁，碇。二号机原本不应该是使徒。我们不知道接下来事情会如何发展。我需要你采取果断行动，确保剧本的推进。"每当基尔·洛伦兹私下会见他时，他就知道一定有什么严重的问题。

Gendo knew things were deviating farther and farther from his plans. In his scenario, the Second Child was supposed to be defeated by Z eruel effortlessly so she would be ego-bashed hard. And then the fifteenth Angel would destroy her completely. Her mental state would also affect his son. Now it seemed like not only she was likely to be an Angel but also her confidence would be boosted since she had just saved the day. Gendo didn't like things out of his control. Indeed he needed to take drastic actions. "I am aware of the situation. The only option left now is to erase the Second Child while making it look believable." He smiled evilly under his clasped hands. No one escapes his control.  
源度知道事情正越来越偏离他的计划。按照他的设想，二号适格者应该被零号机轻松击败，从而遭受严重的自尊打击。接着，第十五使徒会彻底摧毁她。她的心理状态也会影响到他的儿子。现在看来，她不仅可能成为使徒，而且刚刚拯救了局面，信心也会大增。源度不喜欢事情脱离他的掌控。确实，他需要采取果断行动。“我了解情况。现在唯一的选择是抹去二号适格者，同时让这一切看起来可信。”他双手合十下露出了邪恶的笑容。没有人能逃脱他的控制。

### Chapter 13: Beyond the Heart

AN; Now the story officially progressed to a more depressing part of Evangelion, so there won't be WAFFy content for a while. Spare some of the technical details in this chapter. There's also some light humor here. Leave a review!  
AN；现在故事正式进入了《新世纪福音战士》中较为压抑的部分，所以暂时不会有温馨内容了。本章省略了一些技术细节，同时也穿插了一些轻松幽默。欢迎留下评论！

I do not own Evangelion. Chapter 13: Beyond the Heart  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。第 13 章：超越心灵

Asuka slowly opened her eyes; her eyes quickly adjusted to the blinding light. 'Unfamiliar ceiling, must in a hospital.' She first tried to move around a little, but she felt a strange weight on her limbs and waist. 'And it's cold like metal,' she thought. Looking around her, she quickly recognized the room was the same one she had been put into after she came out of the volcano. Then her gaze fixed on her arms, just to find bold metal restraints locking her in the bed. 'So I'm restrained. That's why I couldn't move my body. But why? Oh…' She then remembered the fight with Z eruel and when she came out of the entry plug, she was taken into custody by armed guards. 'They must've noticed something. Just Great.'  
明日香缓缓睁开双眼；她的眼睛很快适应了刺眼的光线。'陌生的天花板，一定是在医院里。'她首先试着稍微动一下，但感到四肢和腰部有一种奇怪的重量。'而且冷得像金属，'她想。环顾四周，她很快认出这个房间就是她从火山出来后被安置的那个。然后她的目光固定在她的手臂上，发现粗大的金属束缚带将她固定在床上。'所以我被束缚住了。难怪我动不了身体。但为什么？哦……'她随后想起了与 Zeruel 的战斗以及她从插入栓出来时被武装警卫带走的那一刻。'他们一定是注意到了什么。真是太好了。'

"I see you're awake." A female voice came.  
“看来你醒了。”一个女性的声音传来。

Following the voice, Asuka turned her head around and saw blonde hair. "Doctor Akagi," she said weakly, suppressing her anger, Asuka continued, "what… the hell is this about?"  
顺着声音，明日香转过头，看到了一头金发。“赤木博士，”她虚弱地说道，压抑着怒火，明日香继续问，“这…到底是怎么回事？”

"Merely safety measures," Ritsuko said in a monotonous tone, "for now I'd like to ask a few questions." Surely there would be a full- scale interrogation later on, and she had the feeling that Asuka would probably never be allowed to get out of this room ever again. However, Ritsuko would like to ask a few questions for… her  
“只是安全措施，”律子用单调的语气说，“现在我想问几个问题。”毫无疑问，稍后会有全面的审讯，她有种感觉，明日香可能再也不会被允许离开这个房间了。然而，律子想问几个问题，为了…她自己。

personal interest.

"Hmph, why should I comply? You don't trust me and putting these stupid locks on me and expect me to trust you? You're so full of it."  
“哼，我为什么要配合？你们不信任我，还给我上这些愚蠢的锁，还指望我相信你们？你们真是自以为是。”

Ritsuko sighed. She already knew this German redhead was a pain in the butt to deal with. However, another benefit of knowing Asuka's mentality granted her an unfair advantage in situations like this. "It's up to you whether you comply or not. After all, you're the most expandable pilot. Even the First Child holds more purpose than you. You know I could just get rid of you and never have to deal with you again." Ritsuko grinned internally; attacking Asuka's pride was the fastest way to get a reaction from her.  
律子叹了口气。她早已知道这个德国红发女孩是个难缠的角色。然而，了解明日香的心理状态让她在这种情境下占得了不公平的优势。“你是否服从取决于你自己。毕竟，你是最容易被替换的驾驶员。就连第一适格者都比你更有价值。你知道我可以轻易除掉你，再也不必与你打交道。”律子内心暗自得意；攻击明日香的骄傲是让她迅速反应的最快方法。

However she was dumbstruck to see Asuka simply chuckled. "Ye, you're probably right. I'm just a goddamn tool just like how the Commander treats you. Ha, even the First Child stands at a higher place than you in his heart, Doctor Akagi." The truth was Asuka would have been hurt badly if it was her old self. However, now she had already grown up and almost got rid of her childish behaviors; she also learned a lot during Instrumentality and from Shinji, such as the relationship between Ritsuko and Gendo.  
然而，她惊讶地看到明日香只是轻笑一声。“是啊，你大概没错。我只是个该死的工具，就像指挥官对待你那样。哈，就连第一适格者在他心中都比你站得更高，赤木博士。”事实上，如果是过去的她，这番话会让她深受伤害。但现在，她已经成长了许多，几乎摆脱了幼稚的行为；她在人类补完计划期间和真嗣那里学到了很多，包括律子和源堂之间的关系。

Asuka couldn't help but felt amused when she saw Ritsuko's face contorted. Ritsuko had absolutely no idea of how Asuka, of all people, knew what she had been doing with the Commander, or the fact that he saw Rei above her. 'Stupid clones… I'll destroy you,  
"看到赤木律子的脸扭曲变形，明日香忍不住感到好笑。律子绝对想不到，明日香居然知道她和司令之间的那些事，还有司令对绫波的偏爱。'愚蠢的克隆人……我会毁了你们，'

blue-haired bitch…' Although Ritsuko was fuming, her scientific brain told her to calm down. Indeed it was not a good time to argue with Asuka, who somehow had not been affected by the slightest by her well-calculated attack and retaliated successfully; not to mention the promising possibility of Asuka being an Angel, which wasn't probably a good opponent to fight against. She had a more urgent job to do after all.  
蓝发婊子……'尽管律子怒火中烧，她的科学头脑却告诉她要冷静。确实，现在不是和明日香争吵的好时机，后者不知为何完全没有受到她精心策划的攻击影响，反而成功反击；更不用说明日香可能是个使徒，这绝不是个好对付的对手。毕竟，她还有更紧迫的任务要完成。

Taking several deep breaths to calm herself down, Ritsuko finally said, "Asuka, we don't have to argue here. Just answer me a few questions and I'll leave you alone. Don't you want that?"  
深呼吸几次以平复心情后，律子终于说道：“明日香，我们没必要在这里争论。只要回答我几个问题，我就不会再打扰你。你不想这样吗？”

Truth was Asuka indeed wanted to be left alone at that time. After carefully assessing her options, she decided it wouldn't hurt to at least listen to what the blonde bitch had to ask. "Whatever. Just ask and get over with it."  
事实是，那时明日香确实想一个人待着。在仔细评估了自己的选择后，她认为至少听听那个金发婊子要问什么也无妨。“随便。快问吧，赶紧结束。”

Ritsuko had so many questions in her head. Of course, she wanted to simply ask whether Asuka was an Angel or not, but she kinda already knew what answer she would get, and she didn't expect Asuka to be honest with her. Also, these kinds of questions could save for later during the formal interrogation. "Asuka, we've noticed you could trigger a pattern orange. We don't know whatever you have is transferrable… if it is well… regarding Shinji…"  
律子脑中充满了疑问。当然，她想直接问明日香是不是天使，但她已经大致知道会得到什么答案，也不指望明日香会对她坦诚。而且，这类问题可以留到正式审讯时再问。“明日香，我们注意到你能触发橙色警报。我们不知道你拥有的能力是否可转移……如果是的话……关于真嗣……”

"Transferrable? What the hell does that even mean? And how in the world does this have anything to do with Shinji?" Asuka felt genuinely confused, but she had a bad feeling about what was to come.  
“可转移？这到底是什么意思？而且这跟真嗣有什么关系？”明日香感到真正的困惑，但她对即将发生的事情有种不祥的预感。

"What I wanted to say is, we suspect these… powers you have, we're afraid of they could've been transferred through the… exchange of body fluids, so I have to know whether you've been physically intimate wi-"  
“我想说的是，我们怀疑这些……你拥有的力量，我们担心它们可能通过……体液交换而转移，所以我必须了解你是否有过身体上的亲密接触——”

Asuka now understood where she was getting at. "WHAT? WHAT MADE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? AS IF I'D EVER-" Truth was she  
明日香现在明白她在说什么了。“什么？你怎么会想到那方面去？好像我会有那种事似的——”事实上，她

indeed had been 'physically intimate' with Shinji and he was the only person she ever allowed to be that close to her except Kaji, but she simply felt the question was too unexpected so her reflex took over and immediately denied it.  
确实与真嗣有过‘身体上的亲密’，而且他是除了加持之外唯一被她允许如此接近的人，但她只是觉得这个问题太过突然，所以本能地立即否认了。

"But from your physical examination, I've noticed… certain changes to your body since your arrival in Japan," Ritsuko interrupted her, "And the only person I could think of is him since you two had been close to each other and you live in the same apartment. If it's not Shinji, then this could be much more complicated."  
“但从你的体检报告来看，我发现…自从你来到日本后，你的身体有了某些变化，”律子打断了她，“我能想到的唯一可能就是他，毕竟你们俩关系密切，还住在同一间公寓。如果不是真嗣，那情况可能就复杂多了。”

Asuka sighed in defeat. How could she forget that Ritsuko was a scientist? There were many ways to know what she had done  
明日香无奈地叹了口气。她怎么忘了律子是个科学家呢？有很多方法可以知道她做了什么

without asking her directly. "Fine. Yes I've done it with Shinji. So what? It's not like…" Asuka trailed off as a scary realization came to her, "YOU ARE NOT PLANNING TO RESTRAIN HIM AS WELL ARE YOU? BECAUSE IF YES I SWARE TO GOD-"  
而不需要直接问她。“好吧。是的，我和真嗣做了。那又怎样？又不是…”明日香话说到一半，突然意识到一个可怕的事实，“你不会也打算限制他吧？如果是的话，我发誓——”

"QUIET!" Ritsuko demanded; she added more force into it than she intended, but it had achieved the desired outcome, which was to shut Asuka up, though the true reason she stopped yelling was she realized she was paranoid. The old Asuka wouldn't do it, though.  
“安静！” 律子厉声要求道；她的语气比预想的更加严厉，但确实达到了预期效果，让明日香闭上了嘴。尽管真正让她停止喊叫的原因是她意识到自己过于多疑了。以前的明日香是不会这么做的。

Seeing Asuka stopped talking and seemingly waiting for her to continue, Ritsuko said, "we'll be closely monitoring the behavior of the Third Child, but we don't plan to restrain him. He still had value as a pilot and since you'll be out of the roster for a while we can't afford to lose another pilot." Taking another deep breath, she continued, "however if he exhibits any sign of contamination we'll have no choice but restrain him as well."  
看到明日香停止说话，似乎在等待她继续，律子说道：“我们将密切监控第三适格者的行为，但我们不打算限制他的自由。他作为驾驶员仍有价值，而且既然你将暂时离开名单，我们无法承受再失去一名驾驶员。”她深吸一口气，继续说道：“然而，如果他表现出任何污染迹象，我们将别无选择，只能同样限制他。”

'I'm not gonna kill this bitch because they'll eliminate me if I use my Angelic powers, and Shinji will be hurt. I'm doing this for Shinji only. It's for Shinji. For Shinji. Shinji.' Asuka effectively prevented herself from breaking through the restraints using her AT-Field and strangle the woman in front of her by thinking about Shinji. However, she didn't know how long she could control her anger if she kept talking to Ritsuko. So instead of throwing insults like she had always done, she simply closed her eyes and said, "Whatever. Now leave me alone."  
“我不会杀了这个婊子，因为如果我使用天使之力，他们会除掉我，而真嗣会受伤。我这么做只是为了真嗣。为了真嗣。真嗣。” 明日香通过想着真嗣，有效地阻止了自己利用 AT 力场挣脱束缚并掐死面前女人的冲动。然而，她不知道如果继续和律子交谈，自己能控制愤怒多久。因此，她没有像往常那样破口大骂，而是简单地闭上眼睛说：“随你怎么说。现在让我一个人待着。”

Seeing she had already gotten the answer she wanted, and the redhead clearly showed no more interest in talking, Ritsuko sighed and left the ward.  
看到她已经得到了想要的答案，而且红发少女显然不再有交谈的兴趣，律子叹了口气，离开了病房。

SEELE 01: "Ikari, what's the status of the Second Child? Are we sure she is an Angel?"  
SEELE 01: “碇，二号机的状态如何？我们能确定她是使徒吗？”

Ikari: "Doctor Akagi had performed numerous tests on her, all of them showed no anomalies, both physically and mentally. However she could indeed trigger a pattern orange."  
碇：“赤木博士对她进行了多次测试，结果均显示身心无异常。但她确实能触发橙色模式。”

SEELE 03: "Is it possible that she just happens to have some supernatural power?"  
SEELE 03：“她是否可能恰好拥有某种超自然力量？”

SEELE 09: "The Dead Sea Scrolls predicted no such things. Supernatural powers? Do you think this is some kind of science fiction we live in?"  
SEELE 09：“《死海文书》并未预言此类事情。超自然力量？你以为我们生活在科幻世界里吗？”

Ikari: "There are still too much about the second child we don't know yet. However I plan to move her back into Unit 02."  
碇司令：“关于第二适格者，我们还有很多未知之处。不过，我打算让她重新回到二号机上。”

SEELE 11: "Are you insane Ikari? What if she's an Angel? And why wouldn't she pilot Unit D?"  
SEELE 11：“碇司令，你疯了吗？万一她是使徒怎么办？而且为什么她不驾驶 D 型机？”

Ikari: "The Second Child showed no sign of being drawn to Adam or Lilith. We didn't have any problems before as well."  
碇司令：“第二适格者并未表现出对亚当或莉莉丝的任何倾向。之前我们也没有遇到任何问题。”

SEELE 02: "That's before she knew we knew about her powers! Now her cover's blown who knows what she would do!"  
SEELE 02: “那是在她不知道我们已知晓她能力之前的事了！现在她的伪装已破，谁知道她会做出什么来！”

Ikari: "I have my own considerations about putting her back into Unit  
碇司令：“关于让她重新驾驶初号机，我有自己的考量。”

2. I shall have the Second Child erased when the time fits." Gendo grinned evilly under his clasped hands again.  
    “时机合适时，我会让二号机驾驶员消失。”碇源堂再次在交握的双手下露出邪恶的笑容。

SEELE 03: "How would you do that? If she happens to be an Angel, how'd you kill her? Step on her with an EVA? I doubt any of your pilots would do that."  
SEELE 03: \"你打算怎么做？如果她恰好是使徒，你怎么杀她？用 EVA 踩死她吗？我怀疑你的驾驶员们会这么做。\"

Ikari: "Like I said, the Second Child will be erased when the time fits. And It will come as a surprise."  
Ikari: \"就像我说的，当时机合适时，第二适格者将被抹除。而且这将是个意外。\"

SEELE 04: "What about Agent Ryoji? He's getting to dangerous information."  
SEELE 04: \"那特工绫人呢？他正接近危险的信息。\"

Ikari: "I will have him erased as well after his final mission."  
碇：“在他完成最终任务后，我也会让他消失。”

SEELE 01: "Good. Prepare to receive the Sixth Child, Ikari. He shall arrive in a month." Keel Lorenz shut off the hologram and leaned back against his chair. The uncertainties that happened before forced him to awake Tabris much earlier than he intended; he was  
"SEELE 01：“很好。准备接收第六使徒，碇。他将在一个月内抵达。”基尔·洛伦兹关闭了全息影像，靠回椅背。之前发生的不确定性迫使他比原计划更早唤醒塔布里斯；他本打算在第十三使徒之前将他送往 NERV 总部驾驶无人使用的二号机。然而，第五使徒光·榊的发现填补了空缺，于是他撤销了决定。现在第二使徒的再次出现给他的计划增添了更多不确定性。他只能寄希望于碇源堂能成功执行他的计划。”

about to send him to NERV HQ before the thirteenth Angel to pilot the unoccupied Unit 02. However, the discovery of the Fifth Child Hikari Horaki filled in the blank, so he took back the decision. Now the reappearance of the Second Child added more uncertainty into his scenario. He could only hope Gendo Ikari could execute his plan successfully.  
正准备在第十三使徒之前将他送往 NERV 总部驾驶无人使用的二号机。然而，第五使徒光·榊的发现填补了空缺，于是他撤销了决定。现在第二使徒的再次出现给他的计划增添了更多不确定性。他只能寄希望于碇源堂能成功执行他的计划。

Shinji felt so uneasy sitting in the backseat of Misato's RA A310. Part of it was because of her crazy driving style; then there was the situation regarding Asuka; he was afraid that NERV would do some horrible experiments on her. And he was also worried about Kaji. If he remembered correctly, Kaji would soon be eliminated by some killer sent by Gendo or SEELE. He had to prevent that from happening.  
坐在 Misato 的 RA A310 后座上，真嗣感到非常不安。一部分是因为她疯狂的驾驶风格；还有就是关于明日香的情况；他担心 NERV 会对她进行一些可怕的实验。同时，他也担心加持。如果他没记错的话，加持很快就会被源堂或 SEELE 派来的杀手干掉。他必须阻止这件事发生。

After they entered the apartment, Misato double-checked the lock and safety and closed every window of the apartment. Then she dragged Shinji to the living room and order him to sit down. Shinji complied, but he was confused to see the frown had never left Misato's face. "Is there anything wrong, Misato-san?"  
进入公寓后，美里再次检查了门锁和安全措施，并关闭了公寓的所有窗户。然后她把真嗣拖到客厅，命令他坐下。真嗣照做了，但他注意到美里的眉头始终紧锁，感到困惑。“有什么不对劲吗，美里小姐？”

Misato was wandering around the living room, her hands on her hips. "I need you to be honest with me, Shinji."  
美里在客厅里徘徊，双手叉腰。“真嗣，我需要你对我诚实。”

'Ah, and there's also this,' Shinji thought, 'how could I forget I should tell Misato the truth…' "Y-yes, Misato-san."  
'啊，还有这个，' 真嗣心想，'我怎么能忘记应该告诉美里真相……' '是-是的，美里小姐。'

Misato took a deep breath, "Shinji… you've always known that Asuka was alive, right?" She had always been wondering why Shinji was not depressed after Asuka's supposed death, now through her deductive reasoning, the answer was obvious.  
美里深吸了一口气，"真嗣……你一直都知道明日香还活着，对吧？" 她一直纳闷为什么真嗣在明日香被认为死亡后没有陷入抑郁，现在通过她的推理，答案显而易见。

Shinji sighed, "errr, you could say that Misato-san."  
真嗣叹了口气，"呃，你可以这么说，美里小姐。"

"Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?" Misato sounded hurt; she thought she was trusted by Shinji, however if it was the case why he didn't even bother to tell her the truth?  
"你为什么不早点告诉我这件事？" 美里听起来很受伤；她以为真嗣信任她，但如果真是这样，为什么他连真相都不愿意告诉她呢？

"I-I've actually told you, Misato-san…" Indeed he had told her he 'knew she was alive,' but he didn't give any evidence or reasons. "I, errr, at that time, I couldn't tell you how I knew, though."  
"我-我确实告诉过你，美里小姐…" 他的确告诉过她他'知道她还活着'，但他没有提供任何证据或理由。"我，呃，那时候，我无法告诉你我是怎么知道的。"

"Why? Don't you trust me?"  
"为什么？你不信任我吗？"

"I trust you, I really do, Misato-san. You, Asuka, Rei, and Kaji are the only people I really trust." Shinji paused for a few seconds, "but the truth may be too difficult to accept for you. Even for Asuka, it was hard."  
"我信任你，真的，美里小姐。你、明日香、绫波，还有加持，是我真正信任的人。" 真嗣停顿了几秒，"但真相对你来说可能太难接受了。即使是明日香，也很难接受。"

"Shinji, I don't care how hard it is to accept, I've already experienced so many things that seemed impossible. I just want an explanation how Asuka survived."  
"真嗣，我不在乎接受起来有多难，我已经经历过太多看似不可能的事情。我只想知道明日香是如何活下来的。"

"Misato-san, what I'm going to tell you… you have to brace yourself." Shinji took a deep breath. Seeing Misato nod, Shinji continued, "Misato-san, will you believe me if I say… that Asuka and I are from the future?"  
"美里小姐，我要告诉你的事……你得做好心理准备。" 真嗣深吸了一口气。看到美里点头，真嗣继续说道，"美里小姐，如果我说……明日香和我来自未来，你会相信吗？"

Misato blinked. Of course it made sense since Asuka and Shinji seemed so knowledgeable about what would happen, and there was also the synchronization training thing. But it was still a shock to hear it from Shinji. Looking straight into Shinji's cobalt eyes, Misato said, "Sh-Shinji, promise you're not joking."  
美里眨了眨眼。当然，这说得通，因为明日香和真嗣似乎对即将发生的事情了如指掌，还有那个同步训练的事。但听到真嗣亲口说出来，还是让她震惊。美里直视着真嗣的钴蓝色眼睛，说道：“真-真嗣，你保证不是在开玩笑。”

"I'm not, Misato-san," Shinji said with a serious look in his eyes, "I'm being truthful for every single word I say now."  
“我没有，美里小姐，”真嗣眼中带着严肃的神情说道，“我现在说的每一个字都是真心的。”

"I guess that explains a lot of things… but how did you get here actually?"  
“我想这解释了很多事情……但你究竟是怎么来到这里的？”

"It's a long story…" "I'm listening."  
"这是个很长的故事……" "我在听。"

"Well, I'll start from the next Angel…" Shinji swallowed, trying to shake off unpleasant memories, "it's called Arael. It sits in orbit and  
"嗯，我将从下一个使徒开始讲起……" 真嗣咽了口唾沫，试图摆脱不愉快的记忆，"它叫做亚拉尔。它停留在轨道上，

none of our weapons could reach and kill it. And… it… Asuka…" he  
"我们的任何武器都无法触及并摧毁它。而且……它……对……明日香……" 他

took a deep breath, "it destroyed her mind."  
深吸了一口气，“它摧毁了她的心智。”

Misato gasped, "Oh gods… Shinji…"

"it's okay… I was there t-to comfort and s-support her, and she recovered rather quickly." Shinji smiled weakly, "and the next one… Armisael… it looks like a double helix, and… it tried to biofuse with our EVA… and ourselves." Shinji paused for a second, "it was Rei… she self-destructed to kill the Angel."  
“没事的……我当时在那里安慰和支持她，她恢复得相当快。”真嗣虚弱地笑了笑，“而下一个……阿米沙尔……它看起来像一个双螺旋结构，而且……它试图与我们 EVA 以及我们自身进行生物融合。”真嗣停顿了一下，“是绫波……她自爆了，为了消灭使徒。”

"I-I'm really sorry to hear that…" Although she didn't know Ayanami very well before, Misato became more and more acquainted with her since her relocation. "I… we'll not let that happen this time, right?"  
“我……听到这个真的很遗憾……”虽然之前对绫波并不熟悉，但自从她搬来后，美里越来越了解她了。“我……我们这次不会让这种事再发生了，对吧？”

"Right," Shinji replied, "then it's the last Angel, Tabris. Or… the Fif- Sixth Child, Kaworu Nagisa."  
“好的，”真嗣回答，“那么这就是最后一个使徒，塔布里斯。或者说……第五六号适格者，渚薰。”

"Wait, Sixth Child? He's one of our pilots?" Misato was surprised that NERV could be infiltrated by an Angel disguised as a pilot; she thought the process of selecting pilots was very rigorous.  
“等等，第六适格者？他也是我们的驾驶员之一？”美里惊讶于 NERV 竟会被一个伪装成驾驶员的使徒渗透；她原以为选拔驾驶员的过程是非常严格的。

"Well… actually he's sent here by SEELE… do you know about SEELE, Misato-san?"  
“嗯……实际上他是被 SEELE 派来的……美里小姐，你知道 SEELE 吗？”

"SEELE… I've heard about it, the real men controlling NERV and Human Instrumentality Committee, right?" Misato tried to recall what Kaji told her.  
“SEELE……我听说过，真正掌控 NERV 和人类补完委员会的幕后黑手，对吧？”美里试图回忆起加持告诉她的话。

"Right. Simply saying they're bad people…"  
“对。简单来说，他们就是坏人……”

"But why would they send an Angel to NERV, the very place we've been trying to keep Angels… oh. Where Angels die."  
“但他们为什么要派一个使徒到 NERV，那个我们一直试图保护使徒……哦。使徒陨落之地。”

"That's right, Misato-san. They send him here to weaken our defenses… so that they could defeat us with ease."  
“没错，美里小姐。他们把他送到这里来削弱我们的防御……以便轻松击败我们。”

Misato was dumbfounded, "wha-why? Why would they attack  
美里目瞪口呆，“什-为什么？他们为什么要攻击？”

NERV?"

"So apparently SEELE wanted to start Third Impact…" "Third… Impact?"  
“所以显然 SEELE 想要引发第三次冲击……”“第三次……冲击？”

"Yeah, and they plan to initiate the Third Impact of their own version, so that they could become gods or something. However, after Third Impact apparently Lilith found me and gave me a second chance, and she sent me here."  
"是的，他们计划启动他们版本的第三次冲击，以便成为神之类的存在。然而，在第三次冲击之后，莉莉丝找到了我，给了我第二次机会，并将我送到了这里。"

"Lilith? The second Angel? And what actually happened during Third Impact?"  
"莉莉丝？第二个使徒？第三次冲击期间究竟发生了什么？"

"Yeah… Lilith is the white giant in Central Dogma…" "Wait, I thought it was Adam they put in there."  
"嗯……莉莉丝就是中央教条区的那尊白色巨人……""“等等，我以为他们放进去的是亚当。”"

"No, it was Lilith, Adam is in my father's possession right now."  
"不，是莉莉丝，亚当现在在我父亲手里。"

"Wha… why? Why would the Commander possess the first Angel? And how does he do it?"  
"什…为什么？指挥官为什么要拥有第一位天使？他又如何做到的？"

"Thanks to Kaji, he gave the embryo of Adam to him. And my father had his own plan of… Instrumentality, which is Third Impact, to unite with my mother. In order to do so he need Adam under his control."  
"多亏了加持，他把亚当的胚胎给了他。而我父亲有自己的计划…实现人类补完计划，也就是第三次冲击，与我的母亲合为一体。为此，他需要亚当在他的掌控之下。"

"Kaji… you bastard…" Misato's lips were trembling; she couldn't believe thethe man he loved and trusted would bring the thing that killed her dad and could cause humanity's extinction to the very person who plans on doing so.  
"加持…你这个混蛋…" 美里嘴唇颤抖着；她无法相信自己深爱并信任的男人会将那个杀死她父亲、可能导致人类灭绝的东西带到计划实施这一切的人面前。

"D-Don't blame him, Misato-san, he had his job or they'll kill him." Shinji sighed heavily; the truth was he himself wasn't even sure why did Kaji brought Adam to his father. Probably it was as simple as following orders. "… And during Third Impact everyone on earth would be turned into LCL, and all souls would return to the Black Moon. There wouldn't be any difference between people, we all become one. SEELE sees this as the ultimate evolution of humanity."  
"别怪他，美里小姐，他有他的任务，否则他们会杀了他。" 真嗣重重地叹了口气；事实上，他自己也不确定加持为何要将亚当带到他父亲那里。可能只是简单地服从命令。"…而在第三次冲击期间，地球上的每个人都会变成 LCL，所有灵魂将回归黑月。人与人之间将不再有区别，我们都将融为一体。SEELE 视此为人类终极进化的标志。"

"Fine… this is a lot to take in at once…" Misato rubbed her forehead, "spare the technical details for now. So what about Asuka? Did she come with you?"  
"好吧…这信息量有点大…" 美里揉着额头，"技术细节先放一边。那明日香呢？她跟你一起来了吗？"

"No, she's from a different… universe, you could say. I was in the center of Third Impact so Lilith could give me another chance. In Asuka's universe, apparently she was in the center."  
"不，她来自另一个……可以说是宇宙吧。我在第三次冲击的中心，所以莉莉丝给了我另一次机会。在明日香的宇宙里，显然她也在中心。"

"But… isn't this a bit coincidental?"  
"但是……这不是有点太巧合了吗？"

"Yeah it is, but it did happen… so I guess just accepted it."  
"是啊，确实很巧，但事情确实发生了……所以我想只能接受它了。"

"But if she's from another… universe, how did you, errr, come together so smoothly?"  
"但如果她来自另一个……宇宙，你们又是怎么，呃，如此顺利地走到一起的呢？"

"Because… we l-love each other, even across universes, Misato- san." Shinji said with determination in his eyes.  
"因为……我们彼此相爱，哪怕跨越宇宙，美里小姐。" 真嗣坚定地说道，眼中闪烁着决心。

"That's good to hear, Shinji. Gosh, I wish I could have something like that… But… that still doesn't explain how did she survive."  
"听到你这么说真好，真嗣。天哪，我也希望能拥有那样的感情……但……这仍然没有解释她是怎么活下来的。"

"Well, you see… when we traveled here, something happened to us which we don't know of, and we… hmmm… we just happen to… to…" Shinji stammered, not sure whether he should say it.  
"嗯，你看……我们来到这里时，发生了一些我们不知道的事情，而我们……呃……我们恰好……恰好……" 真嗣结巴着，不确定是否应该说出来。

"Let me guess, you were given certain powers."  
"让我猜猜，你们被赋予了某种力量。"

Shinji sighed, "yeah… actually, we have Angelic powers."  
真嗣叹了口气，"是的……实际上，我们拥有天使般的力量。"

Misato gasped. Her eyes widened in fear, her right hand subconsciously reached for her pistol. "Wha-what d-do you mean by Ange-Angelic power, Shinji?"  
美里倒吸一口凉气，眼中闪过恐惧，右手下意识地摸向手枪。“什、什么意思，真嗣？你说的‘天使之力’是什么？”

"No! Misato-san, it's not what you think! We are not Angels! And we won't do what Angels do!"  
“不！美里小姐，不是你想的那样！我们不是天使！也不会做出天使所做的事！”

Misato's brain was running at full power. She could accept the fact that Shinji and Asuka traveled back in time, but Angelic powers? She had always loathed Angels; she would take every chance possible to  
美里的思绪飞速运转。她能接受真嗣和明日香穿越时空的事实，但天使之力？她一直厌恶天使；她会抓住每一个可能的机会去

dismember them. Now the person sitting in front of her, her surrogate son, happened to at least have the same powers that Angels have.  
将他们肢解。现在坐在她面前的这个人，她的代理儿子，至少拥有与使徒相同的力量。

What did this mean?  
这意味着什么？

Thinking rationally, Misato knew Shinji and Asuka couldn't be Angels. Hell, they killed so many Angels themselves. But the fact that two of her kids that she loved had Angelic powers, which she hated, was simply too much to take in.  
理性思考，美里知道真嗣和明日香不可能是使徒。见鬼，他们自己就消灭了那么多使徒。但事实是，她深爱的两个孩子拥有她所憎恨的使徒般的力量，这让她难以接受。

"So… Asuka… used her… powers, to…"  
"所以…明日香…用了她的…能力，来…"

"Y-yes, Misato-san. That's how she survived."  
"是-是的，美里小姐。她就是这样活下来的。"

"Oh gods my head… I really need some rest now…" Misato washed her face with her hands, "Shinji… what you told me today was… really disturbing… but the good thing is I trust you. I guess you were right about not telling me earlier… I trusted NERV that time, and I would probably report you to them… now I knew they kept too many secrets from me, I don't trust them anymore. And… I know there's still something else you wanna tell me, right?" Seeing Shinji nod slowly, she continued, "okay… but I really need to digest all the crap you told me right now…" Exhaling heavily, Misato stood up and went to grab a whole pack of beers and entered her room, leaving Shinji alone in the living room thinking about what he should do next.  
"哦天哪，我的头…我现在真的需要休息一下…" 美里用手洗了洗脸，"真嗣…你今天告诉我的事情…真的很令人不安…但好在我相信你。我想你之前不告诉我是对的…那时候我信任 NERV，很可能会向他们举报你…现在我知道他们对我隐瞒了太多秘密，我不再信任他们了。而且…我知道你还有别的事情想告诉我，对吧？" 看到真嗣缓缓点头，她继续说道，"好吧…但我现在真的需要消化你告诉我的这些乱七八糟的事情…" 重重地叹了口气，美里站起身去拿了一整包啤酒，然后走进自己的房间，留下真嗣一个人在客厅思考接下来该做什么。

'It's about time,' Shinji thought, 'I'll not let you die this time, Kaji-san.' Luckily Shinji knew exactly where to find the triple spy. Shinji grinned widely as he saw the man standing in the middle of the melon field and watering.  
'终于到了这一刻，' 真嗣心想，'这次我不会让你再死去，加治先生。' 幸运的是，真嗣清楚地知道在哪里能找到这位三重间谍。当看到那个男人站在瓜田中央浇水时，真嗣露出了灿烂的笑容。

"I've gotta say, Kaji-san," Kaji turned around to see Shinji approaching; he put down the hose, little drips of water still pouring from its mouth. "I never did take you for the gardening type."  
"我得说，加治先生，" 加治转过身来，看到真嗣正走近；他放下水管，水滴仍从管口滴落。"我从未想过你会是那种喜欢园艺的人。"

"Well, everyone needs a hobby." He shrugged, sprinkling one last batch of melons before cutting the pressure. "I appreciate you want  
"嗯，每个人都有自己的爱好。" 他耸了耸肩，在切断水压前给最后一批瓜果洒了水。"我很感激你想要

to chat with me. I have to admit it does get a little bit lonely being out here all by myself sometimes."  
和我聊聊天。我得承认，有时候一个人待在这里确实会有点孤单。

"It's not a problem." He replied as calmly as he could. "I've got something important to tell you."  
“没问题。”他尽可能平静地回答，“我有件重要的事要告诉你。”

"We need to make another stop first." Shinji narrowed his eyes, looking over at Kaji. He wasn't about to be tricked into helping him run more errands. Kaji seemed to catch onto Ikari's concerns, and quickly loosened his expression to reassure him. "Don't worry." He waved his hand off to the side. "I always like to go out for rice cakes afterward."  
“我们得先再停一下。”真嗣眯起眼睛，看向加持。他可不想被哄骗去帮他跑更多的腿。加持似乎察觉到了真嗣的担忧，迅速放松表情以示安慰。“别担心。”他挥了挥手，“我总是喜欢之后出去吃年糕。”

Shinji kept his eyes fixed on him, waiting to hear specification if they were going out for rice cakes, or if he was just going to be tagging along to watch Kaji eat them. "It's my treat." He said with a genuine grin. Shrugging, Shinji felt he had to reason to refuse. Once the two stepped into his car and buckled up, Kaji began driving down the fairly unused roads of the GeoFront.  
真嗣的目光始终没有离开他，等待着是否要出去吃年糕的明确指示，或者只是跟着加治看他吃。“我请客。”他带着真诚的笑容说道。耸了耸肩，真嗣觉得没有理由拒绝。两人一上车并系好安全带后，加治便开始沿着地底都市中鲜有人迹的道路行驶。

"We need to discuss things in my car. Bugs are everywhere inside the Geofront. Here I can make sure we won't get eavesdropped." Kaji spoke, keeping one hand on the steering wheel, and the other rested on the console.  
“我们需要在我的车里讨论事情。地底都市里到处都是窃听器。在这里，我可以确保我们不会被偷听。”加治说道，一手握着方向盘，另一只手则搭在控制台上。

"Yeah." Shinji nodded, his voice just a little more than a whisper. "Kaji-san, how about you ask me questions? I-I don't know where to start."  
“嗯。”真嗣点头，声音几乎只是耳语。“加治先生，不如你问我问题吧？我——我不知道从何说起。”

His eyes glanced over at Shinji for a brief moment before turning back to the road. "Shinji, now I do trust you; earlier, you told me Asuka was alive, honestly part of me didn't believe you. Now seeing her suddenly appeared from nowhere, I know you've got something to tell me. So my first question would be, where was she all this time?"  
他的目光在真嗣身上短暂停留，随即又转向道路。“真嗣，现在我确实信任你；之前，你告诉我明日香还活着，老实说，我心里有一部分并不相信。现在看到她突然从天而降，我知道你有话要告诉我。那么我的第一个问题是，她这段时间到底在哪里？”

So Shinji told him about the time travel and the sea of Dirac, came along with their Angelic powers. Although the triple agent had braced  
于是真嗣向他讲述了时空穿越和狄拉克海，以及他们拥有的天使之力。尽管这位三重间谍已经做好了接受震撼信息的准备，他仍然感到震惊。然而，他对天使之力这部分接受得异常良好，因为他已经有所怀疑，并且并不觉得这事实对自己构成威胁。“我想这解释了很多……所以，我们失败了，第三次冲击发生了。说实话，根据我收集的情报，我已经怀疑 SEELE 会做出这样的事。”他深吸一口气，继续说道，“那晚你说过……如果我继续这样下去，我会死的。我的推测是，在你的时间线里，我已经死了。”

himself for shocking information, he still found himself stunned. However, he took the Angelic powers part surprisingly well, since he kinda already suspected that, and didn't feel threatened by the fact. "I guess this explains a lot… so, we failed and Third Impact happened. Honestly I'm already suspecting SEELE would do something like this from the intel I gathered." Taking another deep breath, he continued, "that night you said… I'm gonna die if I keep doing this. My speculation is I did die in your timeline."

"Y-you are right, Kaji-san. And… I know what you mean to Asuka, and I don't want to see her hurt. So… please don't die, Kaji-san. I can tell everything you want to know, just…" Shinji said with a pleading look in his eyes.  
"加-加治先生，您说得对。而且……我明白您对明日香的意义，我不想看到她受伤。所以……请不要死，加治先生。我愿意告诉你所有你想知道的事情，只是……" 真嗣眼中带着恳求说道。

The long-haired man remained quiet for a moment, thinking of a good way to respond. "Shinji, I appreciate your care. However, it's already too late for me. I'm pretty sure they will get rid of me after my current assignment."  
长发男子沉默了一会儿，思考着如何回应。"真嗣，谢谢你的关心。但对我来说已经太迟了。我确信他们会在我完成当前任务后除掉我。"

"Kaji," Shinji spoke after a brief moment of stillness between the two. "What is your assignment? Maybe I can help you… with my powers."  
"加治，" 真嗣在两人短暂的静默后开口道，"你的任务是什么？也许我可以利用我的能力帮助你。"

Ryoji blinked, taken back by the unexpected offer of the otherwise shy boy. "I guess it wouldn't hurt if I tell you since you already know too much… so SEELE wanted me to kidnap Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki so they could interrogate him, and I did. Now I'll extract him… after this, I'm sure they'll want me dead. I don't know how you may help without your cover blown."  
Ryoji 眨了眨眼，被这个平时害羞的男孩突如其来的提议惊到了。“我想告诉你也无妨，既然你已经知道太多……所以 SEELE 让我绑架副司令 Fuyutsuki，以便他们审问他，我也照做了。现在我要把他救出来……之后，我确信他们会想让我死。我不知道你如何在不被揭穿的情况下帮忙。”

Ikari turned back to the wall, watching the lights as they rose the last thirty or so meters to the surface. "Kaji-san… think about it this way. You're being paranoid; what's the point of rescuing him anyway?"  
Ikari 转回墙边，看着灯光上升到地表最后三十米左右。“Kaji 先生……这么想吧。你太偏执了；救他有什么意义呢？”

"Probably to make amend for what I've done…" Kaji threw his gaze forward as the setting sun peaked through while the lift carried them up to the surface. He narrowed his eyes slightly, both to block out the intense light of the sun, and to also express his own frustration with  
“大概是为了弥补我所做的……”Kaji 向前望去，夕阳透过升降机将他们带向地表时洒下光芒。他微微眯起眼睛，既是为了挡住强烈的阳光，也是为了表达自己的沮丧。

seeking out the truth. Now that he knew what he had always wanted  
追寻真相。如今他已知晓一直渴望了解的答案

to know, he wasn't dying with regrets. Or… was he?  
他不再带着遗憾离世。或者……他真的没有遗憾吗？

"What about Misato? What about Asuka?" Shinji said forcefully, "If you're not doing this for yourself, do it for them! Don't be so selfish, Kaji-san! I care about them, I love them, Kaji-san! I don't want them to be hurt! Last time after you died… Misato… was…"  
“那美里呢？明日香呢？”真嗣坚定地说，“如果你不是为了自己，那就为了她们去做！别这么自私，加持先生！我在乎她们，我爱她们，加持先生！我不希望她们受到伤害！上次你死后……美里她……”

Kaji suddenly couldn't see him in the eyes. "Maybe you're right, Shinji-kun. But I think they're better off without me. My job could bring them danger."  
加持突然不敢直视他的眼睛。“也许你是对的，真嗣君。但我觉得他们没有我会更好。我的工作可能会给他们带来危险。”

Shinji sighed. 'Even if you're not accepting my help, I'll just do it anyway.' He thought quietly, turning his gaze to the road.  
真嗣叹了口气。‘即使你不接受我的帮助，我也会照样去做。’他默默地想着，将目光转向道路。

After Kaji had sent him back to the apartment, Shinji went directly for Rei.  
加持送他回到公寓后，真嗣直接去找了绫波。

"Come in." Shinji heard after he pressed the doorbell. Using the spare keycard to open the door and entering the apartment, Shinji found Rei sitting firmly on the sofa, her crimson eyes staring at him, which seemed to penetrate his soul. "Um, Hello, Rei."  
"请进。" 门铃按下后，真嗣听到了回应。他用备用钥匙卡打开门，进入公寓，发现丽正坚定地坐在沙发上，她那鲜红的眼睛盯着他，仿佛能穿透他的灵魂。"呃，你好，丽。"

"Shinji-kun."

"Rei, I-I have something to tell you, it's important," Shinji and Asuka had been discussing the role of Ayanami during Third Impact; they wanted to convince Rei not to fuse with Lilith, and they would find a way to defeat all MP EVAs so Instrumentality won't happen at all. "I, hmmm, do you know what my father plans to do with you?"  
"丽，我有件事要告诉你，很重要，" 真嗣和明日香一直在讨论绫波在第三次冲击中的角色；他们想说服丽不要与莉莉丝融合，并找到一种方法击败所有量产 EVA，从而阻止人类补完计划的发生。"我，嗯，你知道我父亲打算对你做什么吗？"

Rei was taken aback by the sudden question. She had been aware of the Angelic powers that Shinji and Asuka possessed, however she didn't expect anyone other than Commander Ikari or maybe Fuyutsuki or Ritsuko to know her true purpose, much less her origins. She had a vague idea of what the Commander would do with  
丽被这突如其来的问题惊到了。她知道真嗣和明日香拥有天使般的力量，但她没想到除了碇司令或可能是冬月或律子之外，还有人知道她的真正目的，更不用说她的起源了。她对司令会如何利用她有一个模糊的概念。

her, and she before she was willing to do whatever the older Ikari  
她，以及她在愿意为年长的碇源堂做任何事之前

would want her to do since he was the reason of her existence. She had no other purposes. In retrospect, Shinji and Asuka had been taking care of her since their visit to her old apartment that day; she felt ambivalent about whether she should continue to trust Commander Ikari or her fellow pilots. Without the drugs she could experience many new emotions, many of them she regarded as pleasant, and all of these came from Shinji and Asuka. "I am aware that Commander Ikari has personal use of me," Shinji at first misunderstood her wording and thought it was some kind of child abuse but he soon shrugged it off, remembering Rei's lack of ability to express herself effectively, "however I am… ambivalent about what should I do."  
因为她存在的理由就是他。她没有其他目的。回想起来，自从那天他们拜访她的旧公寓以来，真嗣和明日香一直在照顾她；她对是否应该继续信任碇司令或她的同伴驾驶员感到矛盾。没有药物，她可以体验到许多新的情感，其中许多她认为是愉快的，而这些都来自真嗣和明日香。“我知道碇司令对我有个人用途，”真嗣一开始误解了她的措辞，以为是一种儿童虐待，但他很快耸耸肩，想起了绫波缺乏有效表达自己的能力，“然而我……对应该做什么感到矛盾。”

"Rei… I don't want to force you to do anything, all I'm gonna say is… make your own decision. You're a person who can make up your own mind, okay?" Although Shinji wanted to convince Rei to not follow Ikari's orders, he also knew being too pushy would do more harm than good. Additionally he remembered Rei had self- destructed to defeat the 16th Angel, and the new Rei would probably be devoid of any emotions again. This time he needed to ensure that won't happen.  
"丽…我不想强迫你做任何事，我只想说…自己做决定吧。你是一个能自己拿主意的人，好吗？" 尽管真嗣想说服丽不要听从碇的命令，但他也知道过于强硬只会适得其反。此外，他记得丽曾为了击败第 16 使徒而自爆，新的丽可能会再次失去所有情感。这次他必须确保这种情况不会发生。

"That is… agreeable," Rei said, "however I do wish to… inquire more information."  
"那样…可以接受，" 丽说，"不过我确实希望…了解更多信息。"

"Go ahead, Rei." "说吧，丽。"

"I wish to know… how much do you know about me?"  
"我想知道…你对我了解多少？"

Shinji inhaled sharply; he didn't know if it was a good idea to tell Rei everything, yet. He wasn't sure how much she still trusted his father, and he didn't want to take the risk. However, knowing Rei had already knew about their Angelic powers and apparently NERV hadn't restrained him yet, he thought he could at least tell her something. "As far as I know… you, hmmm, you're… cloned from my mother and Lilith," Shinji said, carefully examining Rei's reaction, "so that… you're some kind of sibling to me?"  
真嗣深吸了一口气；他不确定现在告诉绫波一切是否是个好主意。他不知道绫波对他的父亲还有多少信任，也不想冒险。然而，既然绫波已经知道他们的使徒力量，而且 NERV 显然还没有限制他，他想至少可以告诉她一些事情。“据我所知…你，嗯，你是…从我母亲和莉莉丝克隆出来的，”真嗣小心翼翼地观察着绫波的反应，“所以…你是我的某种兄弟姐妹吗？”

Rei was actually a bit relieved; she feared Shinji would run away from her as soon as he knew about her true origin. Now seeing Shinji could talk about this rather plainly and apparently he had known this for a while, she brought a small smile to her lips, "That is correct, and thank you, Shinji-kun," Rei paused for a second, "for taking care of me."  
绫波其实松了一口气；她担心真嗣一旦知道她的真实身份就会远离她。现在看到真嗣能如此平静地谈论这件事，显然他已经知道一段时间了，她嘴角露出一丝微笑，“没错，谢谢你，真嗣君，”绫波停顿了一下，“谢谢你照顾我。”

"No problem, Rei. Families look after each other, right? Not to mention we are fellow pilots, and every day we risk our lives to protect humanity." Shinji was glad to see Rei open up to him, in this way he could really anticipate Rei to make the right choice when the time comes.  
"没问题，丽。家人之间互相照顾，对吧？更不用说我们还是同为驾驶员，每天都在冒着生命危险保护人类。" 真嗣很高兴看到丽向他敞开心扉，这样一来，他真的可以期待丽在关键时刻做出正确的选择。

A beam of white light shone into the darkened room, causing for Fuyutsuki's shadow to elongate across the floor. His stomach growled from the lack of food, and his wrists had long since been rubbed raw by the rope that bound them. Barely able to remain awake, he watched as another shadow emerged beside his as echoic footsteps traveled the room. "Sorry it took me so long. I had to take care of something first." Kaji's voice came as both a surprise and a godsend to Kozo.  
一道白光射入昏暗的房间，使得冬月副司令的影子在地板上拉长。他的肚子因饥饿而咕咕作响，手腕早已被绳索磨得血肉模糊。他几乎无法保持清醒，看着另一个影子伴随着回响的脚步声出现在他旁边。"抱歉，花了这么长时间。我得先处理一些事情。" 加持的声音对高雄来说既是惊喜也是救赎。

"They're going to kill you for this, you know?" Though he wasn't going to argue with Kaji freeing him, he felt the least he could do for him was warn him as to what the consequences would be.  
"你知道他们会为此杀了你的，对吧？" 虽然他不打算反对加持释放他，但他觉得至少应该警告加持这将带来的后果。

"They'll have to get in line." Even in the face of the bleakest of situations, he somehow managed to keep his smile. "Besides that, it'll only be a matter of time until SEELE wants me dead anyway."  
"他们得排队了。" 即使面对最黯淡的局势，他不知怎的仍能保持微笑。"再说了，SEELE 迟早也会想要我死的。"

Once his hands were untied, Fuyutsuki grasped his wrists and squeezed them to get the feeling back in them. He slowly rose from his chair and turned to face the long-haired man that had just saved him.  
双手解绑后，冬月握住手腕，用力挤压以恢复知觉。他缓缓从椅子上站起，转身面对刚刚救了他的长发男子。

"Well, I can't thank you enough." He replied. "I was beginning to think that they were just going to let me die in here."  
"好吧，我感激不尽。" 他回答道。"我开始以为他们就打算让我死在这里了。"

"They were."

"Figures." He sighed, kicking his right leg out to get the blood flowing through it again. "So what are you going to do now?"  
"真是的。" 他叹了口气，踢了踢右腿，让血液重新流通。"那你现在打算怎么办？"

"Well," Kaji shrugged, but his grin remained. "I guess I need to make one more phone call while I can."  
"嗯，" 加持耸了耸肩，但笑容依旧。"我想在我还能的时候再打一个电话。"

"You seem pretty calm for a man who knows he's about to die." Though there wasn't a strong sense of sympathy in his tone, Fuyutsuki did his best not to come off as cold. "If SEELE gets what they want, we're all going to die anyway, right?"  
"你看起来相当镇定，知道自己即将死去。" 虽然语气中没有强烈的同情，但冬月尽力不显得冷漠。"如果 SEELE 得到了他们想要的，我们都会死，对吧？"

"Yeah." Kozo rubbed his wrists one more time before lowering them to his sides. "Something like that." He grew silent for a moment, looking back at the darkened room where the monolith holograms were hovering during his interrogation. "We should probably get out of here."  
“嗯。”Kozo 又揉了揉手腕，这才将双手垂下。“差不多吧。”他沉默片刻，回头望向审讯室里悬浮着的黑暗中的单体全息影像。“我们或许该离开这里了。”

"Go ahead." Kaji replied. "I still need to make that phone call." He let out a light chuckle, though this time it did ring slightly of insincerity.  
“你先走吧。”Kaji 回答道。“我还需要打那个电话。”他轻笑一声，但这次笑声中略带几分不真诚。

The Vice Commander met Kaji's eyes with his own, giving him a slight nod. Though Ryoji had his thanks, Fuyutsuki wasn't going to dwell on what would follow. He knew that Kaji was aware of the consequences that would follow his actions, and to shed light on that would just make things even worse than they already were.  
副司令与 Kaji 四目相对，微微点头。尽管 Ryoji 心怀感激，Fuyutsuki 并不打算深究后续。他知道 Kaji 清楚自己行为的后果，再提及只会让情况变得更糟。

"Thank you, Kaji." The elderly man said before passing by him, hobbling out into the white light that shone in from the doorway, his silhouette becoming strongly outlined as he grew nearer to the exit. The long-haired man smirked as he watched the Vice Commander make his leave before pulling out his cell phone.  
“谢谢你，加持。”老人说道，随后从他身边走过，蹒跚地步入从门口射入的白色光芒中，随着他靠近出口，身影愈发清晰。长发男子嘴角微扬，目送副司令离开后，掏出了手机。

Kaji dropped his phone on the ground of the darkened room and then firmly brought his foot down onto it, smashing the device to pieces. Though Misato wasn't there to answer his call, he was able to leave her a message, which in hindsight may have been for the  
加持在昏暗的房间里将手机摔在地上，然后用力踩上去，将其碾成碎片。尽管美里不在，无法接听他的电话，但他还是给她留了言，事后想来这或许是最好的选择。既然现在无法通过手机追踪到他，他迅速离开房间，朝办公室走去。一进门，他立刻关上门，开始删除所有关于 NERV 的发现和笔记，格式化硬盘，并销毁所有纸质文件和文档。他不会留下任何痕迹。

best. Now that he couldn't be tracked by his phone, he quickly made his way out of the room and towards his office. Once inside, he quickly shut the door behind him and got to work deleting all of his findings and notes on NERV, formatting his hard drive and shredding all papers and documents in his possession. He wasn't going to leave anything behind.  
最好。现在他无法通过手机被追踪，他迅速离开房间，朝办公室走去。一进门，他立刻关上门，开始删除所有关于 NERV 的发现和笔记，格式化硬盘，并销毁所有纸质文件和文档。他不会留下任何痕迹。

Letting out a sigh, Kaji headed out the door. He figured that if he hurried, he might be able to get out of the GeoFront before SEELE's sleeper agent found him. As he made his way down the empty halls of NERV HQ, he could hear the faint sound of footsteps off in the distance behind him. He was being trailed. If his assassin was behind him, then perhaps that meant he could run. Picking up the pace, he dashed down the halls towards the parking deck. He could hear the footsteps behind him increase in pace along with his. He was now certain that the person following him was the agent.  
叹了口气，加持走出门去。他想，如果自己动作快点，或许能在 Seele 的潜伏特工找到他之前离开地底都市。他穿过 NERV 总部空荡荡的走廊，隐约听到远处后方传来轻微的脚步声。有人在跟踪他。如果他的暗杀者在他身后，那么或许这意味着他可以逃跑。他加快步伐，朝着停车场飞奔而去。他听到身后的脚步声也随着他的速度加快。现在他确信，跟踪他的人就是那个特工。

However, as he continued, he could begin to hear the sound of footsteps coming from in front of him just around the corner as well. This was it. There was no running now. With one assassin behind him and another coming from in front of him, he had no way to escape. He looked to his right and saw a giant fan blade slowly spinning, circulating air from the GeoFront into NERV Headquarters. As the blade rotated, he could feel a gust of airbrush across his face while the sets of footsteps grew closer to him. Exhaling, he pulled out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it before turning around to face his killer. He was a rather large man. Security personnel it seemed. He was wearing the standard NERV security attire with a MP5 submachine gun strapped around him and a 9mm pistol in hand. "You're late." Kaji spoke, making one last smirk before the assassin raised his gun and pulled the trigger.  
"然而，随着他继续前行，他开始能听到前方拐角处传来的脚步声。就是现在了。已经无路可逃。一名刺客在他身后，另一名正从前方逼近，他无处可逃。他向右看去，见到一个巨大的风扇叶片缓缓旋转，将 GeoFront 的空气循环至 NERV 总部。随着叶片转动，他感受到一阵阵风吹拂过脸颊，而脚步声也越来越近。他呼出一口气，从口袋里掏出一支香烟点燃，然后转身面对他的杀手。那是一个相当魁梧的男人，似乎是保安人员。他穿着 NERV 标准的保安制服，身上挂着 MP5 冲锋枪，手里握着一把 9 毫米手枪。“你来晚了。”加持说道，最后一次露出微笑，随后刺客举起枪，扣动了扳机。”

"…"

The sound of exploding bullet primer never came.  
爆炸的子弹底火声并未响起。

Kaji watch in awe as the assassin disappeared into the darkness.  
加持目瞪口呆地看着刺客消失在黑暗中。

"What the-"

"Kaji-san," Kaji jerked his head around just to find Shinji standing in  
"加治先生，" 加治猛地转过头，只见真嗣站在

front of him, "I… made a promise. To Asuka."  
他面前，"我……许下了一个承诺。对明日香。"

"Right," Kaji sighed, turning his head toward the direction where the agent once stood, "Wha-what… happened to him?"  
"好吧，" 加治叹了口气，将头转向特工曾经站立的方向，"什-什么……他怎么了？"

"He's somewhere in New London right now…" Shinji said, "Kaji- san… you should hide somewhere as well… until everything's settled. I… I refuse to let you die."  
"他现在应该在新伦敦的某个地方…" 真嗣说道，"加持先生…你也应该找个地方躲起来…直到一切都平息。我…我绝不会让你死的。"

Kaji lowered his eyelids, "Shinji-kun, you really shouldn't be doing this; what if NERV found out about you?"  
加持垂下眼睑，"真嗣君，你真的不应该这么做；如果 NERV 发现你的话怎么办？"

"Don't worry, sea of Dirac won't trigger alarms…" Shinji spoke, "I… I can send you to… wherever you want, Kaji-san. And… don't even think about refusing!"  
"别担心，狄拉克海不会触发警报…" 真嗣说，"我…我可以送你去…任何你想去的地方，加持先生。而且…别想着拒绝！"

Kaji knew Shinji could simply send him anywhere he wanted even if he refuses his offer; so instead of rejecting which might cause Shinji to send him to Europe, he consented, "Fine, Shinji-kun. Get me to Tokyo-2, I have a few contacts there."  
加持知道，即使他拒绝真嗣的提议，真嗣也能轻易将他送到任何地方；因此，为了避免可能被送往欧洲的命运，他同意了，“好吧，真嗣君。带我去第二东京，我在那里有几个联系人。”

Asuka had been awake for days, and she was still restrained in the bed. No one except Dr. Akagi and nurses who came to change infusion bags containing glucose solutions was allowed to enter the room. The loneliness and boredom were driving her insane; it was not a good idea to let the Great Asuka Langley Soryu get bored.  
明日香已经好几天没合眼了，她仍被束缚在床上。除了赤木律子博士和来更换装有葡萄糖溶液的输液袋的护士们，没有人被允许进入房间。孤独和无聊正让她发疯；让伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷感到无聊可不是个好主意。

Just as she was about to completely lose control and escape the shithole place using the sea of Dirac, the door hissed open and several guards with submachine guns came in, followed by Ritsuko. "Pilot Soryu, I'm going to unlock the restraints. Don't try anything stupid."  
正当她即将完全失控，准备利用狄拉克海逃离这个鬼地方时，门嘶嘶作响地打开了，几个手持冲锋枪的警卫走了进来，随后是律子。“驾驶员惣流，我要解开束缚了。别做傻事。”

"YES!" Asuka exclaimed, "Just get me outta here! I'm sick of-"  
“太好了！”明日香喊道，“快让我离开这里！我已经受够了——”

"Who said you're free?" Ritsuko interrupted, "we still have to ask you some questions."  
“谁说你自由了？”律子打断道，“我们还有些问题要问你。”

"Wha-you're gonna interrogate me?" Asuka scoffed, "Whatever. It's not like I'm afraid of you Arschlochs!" In fact, Asuka had expected this coming, but making up lies had been difficult. How would she explain her triggering a pattern orange? Maybe she couldn't hider the fact that she could produce AT-Fields anymore. But her ability to use a Dirac Sea could wait.  
“什么——你要审问我？”明日香嗤之以鼻，“随你们便。我才不怕你们这些混蛋！”实际上，明日香早料到会有这一出，但编造谎言可不容易。她要如何解释自己触发了橙色警报？或许她无法再隐瞒自己还能产生 AT 力场的事实。但她使用狄拉克之海的能力可以暂且搁置。

Ritsuko ignored her insults and began unlocking the restraints while the guards aimed their weapons at her. Asuka made no sigh of resistance since she only wanted to get this thing over with as soon as possible, but she kept her death glare directed at Ritsuko, who felt melted by it. "Get up and stretch a little." She said after unlocking all restraints.  
律子无视了她的侮辱，开始解锁束缚带，而警卫们则用武器对准了她。明日香没有表现出任何抵抗的迹象，因为她只想尽快结束这一切，但她始终用死亡凝视盯着律子，让律子感到不寒而栗。“站起来，稍微伸展一下。”律子在解开所有束缚后说道。

Asuka tried to push herself up; she was surprised that her muscles functioned perfectly despite not being used for days. 'Maybe it has something to do with my S2 organ,' She thought. However, she knew she should act a little; so instead of getting up, she pretended to slip due to lack of strength and fell down while groaning in frustration.  
明日香试图撑起自己；她惊讶地发现尽管多日未用，她的肌肉功能却完好无损。‘也许这与我的 S2 器官有关，’她想。然而，她知道应该表现得虚弱一些；所以她没有起身，而是假装因无力而滑倒，跌坐在地，懊恼地呻吟着。

She grinned internally as she saw Ritsuko's amused expression.  
看到律子那副忍俊不禁的表情，她内心暗自窃笑。

After 5 minutes of fake struggling, she finally got up to her feet and followed the group of people to the interrogation room.  
经过 5 分钟的假意挣扎，她终于站起身来，跟随那群人走向审讯室。

The holograms of members of Human Instrumentality Committee sat around the table while Asuka and Ritsuko stood in front of them. This place was duller than before Asuka noticed.  
人类补完委员会成员的全息影像围坐在桌旁，而明日香和律子站在他们面前。这个地方比明日香注意到的以前更加沉闷。

"Report what you know so far, Doctor." The voice came from one of the holograms.  
“报告你目前所知的情况，博士。”其中一个全息影像传出了声音。

"Yes sir. Two weeks ago, we detected a pattern orange in Germany. NERV Berlin examined the area and found DNA traces that matched Pilot Soryu's perfectly, while the latter was believed K.I.A. during the  
"“是的，先生。两周前，我们在德国检测到一个橙色模式。NERV 柏林分部对该区域进行了检查，发现了与飞行员惣流完美匹配的 DNA 痕迹，而后者在第十一使徒的攻击中被认为已经阵亡。”

attack of eleventh Angel. Not long after the pattern orange disappeared the fourteenth Angel attacked, and Pilot Soryu appeared in the empty entry plug of Unit D just in time to defeat the Angel. Pilot Soryu was immediately taken into custody after the battle."  
"“橙色模式消失不久后，第十四使徒发动了攻击，惣流飞行员及时出现在 D 型机空置的插入栓中，击败了使徒。战斗结束后，惣流飞行员立即被拘留。”

"Good. You're dismissed Doctor." Another voice said, and continued after Ritsuko left the room, "Pilot, explain your whereabouts from the moment of the eleventh Angel's attack to the attack of the fourteenth."  
"“很好。你可以离开了，博士。”另一个声音说道，并在律子离开房间后继续，“飞行员，解释一下从第十一使徒攻击到第十四使徒攻击期间你的行踪。”

Asuka took a deep breath, "well, I should start from the eighth Angel actually. While I was sinking down to the volcano, the twelfth Angel saved me and sent me to Germany, using its Dirac sea. That's probably why they could found my DNA traces there. Then during the eleventh's attack, it was actually Unit D which absorbed me into its core and released me during the battle against fourteenth."  
明日香深吸了一口气，“好吧，我应该从第八使徒说起。当我沉入火山时，第十二使徒救了我，利用它的狄拉克海将我送到了德国。这大概就是为什么他们能在那里发现我的 DNA 痕迹。然后在第十一使徒的攻击中，实际上是 D 型机将我吸收进核心，并在与第十四使徒的战斗中释放了我。”

"Lying will do you no good, pilot." Another voice said, "we have satellite recordings of the pattern orange occurrence; during that time, there were seven people around the area, and six of them disappeared while the other one died."  
“说谎对你没有好处，驾驶员。”另一个声音说道，“我们有卫星记录的橙色模式事件；在那段时间，该地区有七个人，其中六人消失了，而另一人死亡。”

Asuka cursed internally about her carelessness and extreme unfortune. How in the world did she just meet those bullies that time that place? Just as she was thinking hard about a plausible explanation, she suddenly remembered something. "Well, I don't know what you're talking about. Are you sure it wasn't some crazy experiments NERV Berlin was doing, like cloning the Angels?"  
明日香内心咒骂自己的粗心和极端不幸。她到底是怎么在那次那个地方遇到那些恶霸的？正当她苦思冥想一个合理的解释时，她突然想起了什么。“嗯，我不知道你在说什么。你确定那不是柏林 NERV 在进行的疯狂实验，比如克隆使徒？”

The leader of Human Instrumentality Committee winced in surprise. 'There's no way she could know about Tabris, right? But it was plausible since Tabris was in NERV Berlin and he was already awake that time.' "Your blind accusations will bring you nowhere, pilot." On the other hand, Asuka knew she got under his skin by capturing the slightest change in his expression. "Ye but remember I came from NERV Berlin. I heard a lot of rumors back then. I mean  
"人类补完委员会的领导人惊讶地皱了皱眉。'她不可能知道塔布里斯的事，对吧？但既然塔布里斯在柏林 NERV，而且那时他已经苏醒了，这也不是不可能。'“你的无端指控毫无意义，驾驶员。”另一方面，明日香知道她通过捕捉到他表情的细微变化，已经触动了他的神经。“是的，但别忘了我来自柏林 NERV。那时候我听到了很多传言。我是说”

Germany is the most technologically advanced country in the world so I guess it make sense that they wanna do crazy experiments."  
德国是世界上技术最先进的国家，所以我想他们想进行疯狂的实验也是有道理的。

"Irrelevant." The voice said. Although he didn't really believe her story, he had to contact Keel Lorenz first to make sure it wasn't Tabris. So he decided to change the subject for now. "Pilot, did the Twelfth Angel try to contact you?"  
“无关紧要。”那个声音说道。尽管他并不真的相信她的故事，但他必须先联系基尔·洛伦兹确认那不是塔布里斯。于是他决定暂时改变话题。“驾驶员，第十二使徒试图联系过你吗？”

Asuka sighed in relief as she knew she had won round one. "Yeah, well, it said it was lonely and wanted me as its company. So I guess that's why it saved me."  
明日香松了口气，知道自己赢得了第一回合。“是啊，它说它很孤单，想要我陪伴。所以我猜这就是它救我的原因。”

This immediately captured the attention of the Committee. They had always craved every single possible chance of learning Angel- human interaction. And this seemed to be a perfect chance.  
这立即引起了委员会的注意。他们一直渴望抓住每一个可能的机会来了解使徒与人类的互动。而这似乎是一个完美的机会。

For the following one hour, the committee bombarded Asuka with questions regarding her interaction with the Angel. Asuka was more than happy to 'answer' them; she didn't expect her lies could bring such a side-effect. Not that she minded, though.  
接下来的一个小时里，委员会对明日香进行了关于她与使徒互动的问题轰炸。明日香非常乐意‘回答’他们；她没想到自己的谎言会带来这样的副作用。不过，她并不介意。

"… thanks for your cooperation, Miss Soryu. You're dismissed." One of the voices said, sounding content.  
“……感谢您的合作，惣流小姐。您可以离开了。”其中一个声音说道，听起来很满意。

Expectedly as soon as Asuka exited the room, she was again escorted back to First Cranial Nerve ward. However, this time they didn't restrain her, probably seeing there's no point in doing so.  
不出所料，明日香一走出房间，就被再次护送回了第一脑神经病房。不过，这次他们没有束缚她，可能觉得这样做没有意义。

SEELE 01: "The interrogation against the Second Child yields curious results. It was certainly a possibility that Tabris triggered the pattern orange; but for now, we have no way to know."  
SEELE 01: “对二号适格者的审讯取得了有趣的结果。确实有可能是塔布里斯触发了橙色模式；但目前，我们无从得知。”

SEELE 04: "He's awake, correct? Why don't you just ask him?"  
SEELE 04: “他醒了，对吧？为什么不直接问他？”

SEELE 01: "Unfortunately, we had to reupload his soul every two weeks. Currently he holds no memory of that day."  
SEELE 01: “遗憾的是，我们不得不每两周重新上传他的灵魂。目前他对那天没有任何记忆。”

Ikari: "The Second Child currently shows no sign of possessing Angelic powers. This way my plan of eliminating the Second Child holds a high chance of success. However, it is required for the Second Child to be put back into Unit 02."  
碇：“第二适格者目前没有表现出拥有使徒力量的迹象。这样一来，我消除第二适格者的计划成功率很高。然而，需要将第二适格者重新放入二号机中。”

SEELE 01: "Action approved. Keep disturbances out of the scenario."  
SEELE 01: \"行动批准。确保场景中无干扰。\"

"That's strange." Aoba squinted his eyes and leaned in closer to his monitor. At first, he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, an unfortunate result of double shifting. Upon further inspection though, he found that his eyes were most certainly not deceiving him.  
\"真奇怪。\" 青叶眯起眼睛，更靠近他的显示器。起初，他以为自己的眼睛在捉弄他，这是双班倒的不幸结果。但进一步检查后，他发现自己的眼睛绝对没有欺骗他。

"What is it?" Hyuga asked, looking over from his monitor in the center of the Command Deck. Tiredness had begun to take its toll on him as well, despite the three empty coffee mugs in front of him. "I just got a strange reading coming from Earth's orbit."  
\"怎么了？\" 日向从指挥甲板中央的显示器旁看过来问道。尽管面前有三只空咖啡杯，疲惫也开始影响他了。\"我刚从地球轨道上收到了一个奇怪的读数。\"

"Oh really?" The engineer got up from his station and made his way over to his coworker.  
"哦，真的吗？" 工程师从他的工作站起身，走向他的同事。

"Hold on, I'll show you." Aoba made a few keystrokes, pulling up his screen from earlier, bringing up what looked like a diagram with a green circle in the middle and numerous little white lights surrounding it. "Just watch." As the white lights blinked, they slowly shifted position, an indication that they were moving along with Earth's orbit. "And right here!" He pointed towards a significantly larger white light that popped up on the screen. As the lights blinked, all the others continued to move. This one however remained completely motionless.  
"等等，我给你看。" Aoba 敲了几下键盘，调出了他早先的屏幕，展示出一个中间有绿色圆圈、周围环绕着许多小白点的图表。"看着。" 随着小白点闪烁，它们慢慢改变位置，表明它们正随着地球轨道移动。"就在这里！" 他指向屏幕上突然出现的一个明显更大的白点。随着其他白点继续闪烁移动，这个白点却完全静止不动。

"It has to be a glitch." Makoto shook his head. "There's no way anything can remain motionless in orbit. Even the tenth Angel had to calculate its trajectory when it went into freefall."  
"这肯定是个故障。" 真琴摇了摇头。"没有任何东西能在轨道上保持静止。即使是第十使徒在自由落体时也得计算其轨迹。"

"But the MAGI don't…" Suddenly the observation deck was filled with the wailing sound of NERV's alarm while red lights flashed  
“但 MAGI 没有…”突然间，观测甲板被 NERV 的警报声淹没，红色灯光闪烁

throughout the room. "Pattern Blue! It's an Angel!"  
遍布整个房间。“蓝色模式！是使徒！”

"Oh my God!" Major Katsuragi gasped at the sight presented on the monitor. The image from their satellite depicted a large winged creature about fifty to sixty meters wide soaring across the upper atmosphere. There was no distinguishable body to speak of, merely two giant connecting wings made of a brilliant light. It almost seemed holy in the way it glowed, very much reminding Misato of the traditional depiction of the biblical angels. "It's been circling Earth's orbit for the past twelve hours or so, judging by its trajectory. Our satellites were only now able to pick it up though." Maya explained. "It's also been flying far out of range for standard weapons, so we have already prepared the positron sniper rifle for Unit 00, and the proton cannon for Unit 02. Unit D will be on standby."  
“哦，我的天哪！”葛城美少校在监视器上呈现的景象前倒吸一口凉气。卫星图像显示，一个巨大的翼状生物约五六十米宽，正在高层大气中翱翔。没有明显的身体，只有两对由耀眼光芒构成的巨大连接翼。它散发出的光芒几乎显得神圣，让美里想起了传统描绘的圣经中的天使。“根据其轨迹判断，它已经在地球轨道上盘旋了大约十二个小时。不过，我们的卫星直到现在才能捕捉到它。”伊吹玛亚解释道，“它也一直飞得远远超出常规武器的射程，所以我们已经为零号机准备了阳电子狙击步枪，为二号机准备了质子加农炮。D 单位将待命。”

"So they are using Hikari?" Misato asked. The fact was Hikari hadn't been doing much training since the thirteenth Angel, and she was worried about her performance in real combat situations.  
"这么说他们要用光了吗？" 美里问道。事实上，自从第十三使徒以来，光一直没有进行多少训练，她担心她在实战中的表现。

"No. The Second Child will pilot Unit 02." A cold voice came from the top, as Misato turned her head in the direction of the voice she found Commander Ikari speaking.  
"不，二号适格者将驾驶二号机。" 一个冷酷的声音从上方传来，美里转头望向声音的方向，发现是碇司令在说话。

"So Asuka's being released?" She hadn't seen her in two weeks and she was worried sick, Shinji as well. Knowing Asuka was at least okay enough to pilot an Evangelion was certainly a big relief. 'So they still don't know about her yet, excellent.'  
"那么明日香要复出了？" 她已经两周没见到她了，非常担心，真嗣也是。知道明日香至少身体状况足以驾驶 EVA，确实是个巨大的安慰。'看来他们还不知道她的状况，太好了。'

"No. Only in combat situations would the Second Child be allowed outside of her room."  
"不行。只有在战斗情况下，二号孩子才被允许离开她的房间。"

"Of course." Misato sighed. She should have known that the oversensitive bastard wouldn't take any risk against his precious scenario.  
"当然。" 美里叹了口气。她早该知道那个过度敏感的混蛋不会对他的宝贝计划冒任何风险。"

10 minute later, Shinji came out of the changing room, just to see  
10 分钟后，真嗣从更衣室出来，正好看到

Asuka waiting for him outside. "Asuka!" Shinji resisted his urge to hug and kiss her by clenching his fists tightly. "A-are you okay? Why  
"明日香在外面等他。“明日香！”真嗣强忍住拥抱和亲吻她的冲动，紧紧握住拳头。“你还好吗？为什么”

are you here? Did they…"  
你会在这里？他们……”

"I'm perfectly fine, Baka." Asuka smiled at him, "I missed you so much!"  
“我完全没事，笨蛋。”明日香对他微笑，“我好想你！”

Shinji smiled as well, but it soon faded when he remembered what's gonna happen with the Angel. Asuka saw Shinji's face darkened and immediately knew what he was thinking about. "Don't worry, Baka.  
真嗣也笑了，但当他想起与使徒即将发生的事情时，笑容很快消失了。明日香看到真嗣的脸色变暗，立刻知道他在想什么。“别担心，笨蛋。”

It's my nightmare, and I will face it!"  
这是我的噩梦，我会面对它！

The pilots chatted about other stuff as they walked down the corridor and entered their respective entry plugs swiftly. The core profile of Unit 02 had been changed back to Asuka's. She was more than happy to sit inside Unit 02 again. However, her anxiety and nervousness had been growing rapidly; last time when she faced the fifteenth Angel, it was not a pleasant memory. She could only hope this time Shinji or Rei could rescue her earlier.  
驾驶员们在走廊上聊着其他事情，迅速进入各自的插入栓。二号机的核心配置已经改回明日香的。她非常高兴再次坐在二号机里。然而，她的焦虑和紧张感迅速增长；上次面对第十五使徒时，那并不是愉快的记忆。她只能希望这次真嗣或绫波能早点来救她。

"EVAs launch!" Misato ordered. Unit 02 and Unit 0o shot up from the base. Topside, the four-eyed Evangelion sprung out of the elevator, taking position atop a large hill overlooking Tokyo-3. The overcast stretched out as far as she could see, and the rain was pouring.  
“EVA 启动！”美里命令道。零号机和二号机从基地冲天而起。地面上，那台四眼福音战士从电梯中跃出，占据了一座俯瞰第三新东京市的大山丘。乌云密布，绵延至她目力所及之处，大雨倾盆而下。

Flipping through her monitors, she switched to lowlight vision. This way she could see through the sick clouds.  
她翻阅着监控屏幕，切换到低光视觉模式。这样她就能透过病态的云层观察。

The blue Unit 00 crouched behind another hill, gripping on the positron sniper rifle tightly. Rising its positron rifle and took aim on the Angel, Rei focused on the blue crosshair danced around the screen, circling closer and closer to the glowing beast that soared miles and miles above her. "I have locked on the target," the bluenette held her breath as the crosshair made one more loop around the target before locking onto the core of the Angel, turning from blue to red. "Firing." Just as Unit 00 begun to squeeze its finger on the trigger, her screen was filled with a brilliantly blinding light as the Angel started to glow even brighter. From it, a beam of light shot down from the Angel and pierced through the clouds as it shone  
蓝色的零号机蹲伏在另一座山丘后，紧握着阳电子狙击步枪。它举起阳电子步枪，瞄准天使，绫波零专注于屏幕上跳动的蓝色十字准星，它越来越接近那只翱翔于高空的闪光巨兽。“已锁定目标，”蓝发少女屏住呼吸，十字准星在目标周围再绕一圈后锁定其核心，从蓝色变为红色。“开火。”就在零号机开始扣动扳机的那一刻，屏幕被天使愈发耀眼的光芒填满。从天使身上，一道光束穿透云层，照耀下来。

down onto the blue Evangelion.  
坠向蓝色的福音战士。

"No!" Both Asuka and Shinji cried out as they realized the Angel's target.  
“不！” 明日香和真嗣同时惊呼，意识到使徒的目标。

Rei screamed in pain, clasping her hands against her head.  
绫波丽痛苦地尖叫，双手紧抱头部。

_"That's not your business, Old hag." "Old hag?"  
"那不关你的事，老太婆。" "老太婆？"_

_"I can find the way by myself, Old hag."  
"我自己能找到路，老太婆。"_

_"Y ou shouldn't call someone an old hag, Rei." "But you are an old hag, aren't you?"  
"你不应该叫别人老太婆，丽。" "但你就是个老太婆，不是吗？"_

_"I'm getting mad, Commander Ikari will spike you…" "Commander's the one who calls you that."  
"我要生气了，碇司令会把你……" "是司令他这么叫你的。"_

_"Wha-what?"_

_"He says, the old hag is throwaway. That old hag is useless." Hands around her throat. Pain. Oxygen deprivation. Death.  
"他说，那个老太婆是废物。那老太婆没用。"双手掐住她的脖子。疼痛。缺氧。死亡。_

"NO! GET OUT!" Rei screamed as her predecessor's memories resurfaced.  
"不！滚出去！" 绫波零尖叫着，前任的记忆涌上心头。

_"I'm sorry, Rei, I want to unite with Adam…" "No! Y ou said you won't do what Angel's do! " "I'm sorry… I'm sorry…"  
"对不起，丽，我想与亚当合为一体……" "不！你说过你不会做天使所做的事！" "对不起……对不起……"_

"NO! GET OUT OF MY HEAD!"  
"不！从我脑海中滚出去！"

_"Y ou are Rei Ayanami." "I am Rei Ayanami."_

_"Y ou will follow my orders." "I will follow your orders." Doll.  
"你将服从我的命令。" "我将服从你的命令。" 玩偶。"_

"It hurts! Arghhh!"

"What's happening?" Misato yelled, "What's the Angel trying to do?" Although she had already known the ability of Arael from Shinji, she had to maintain some form of professionalism.  
"发生了什么？" 美里大喊，"使徒想做什么？" 尽管她已经从真嗣那里知道了亚拉尔的能力，但她必须保持一定的专业性。

Ritsuko gasped as she watched Rei's synchrograph go ballistic. What started out as a steady reading began to turn erratic. "Brain wave activity is off the chart! If this keeps up, she'll have an aneurism! It's trying to read Rei's mind… It's trying to understand her psychology by digging through her mind."  
律子倒抽一口凉气，看着丽同步率表疯狂跳动。原本稳定的读数开始变得不稳定。"脑波活动超出了正常范围！如果这种情况持续下去，她会脑溢血的！它试图读取丽的思维……它试图通过挖掘她的内心来理解她的心理。"

"Rei! Can you hear me! Pull back!" Misato yelled into the comms. "I'll take the shot! Hang on, Rei!" Asuka took aim at the Angel and  
"丽！你能听到我吗！撤回来！" 美里对着通讯器大喊，"我来开枪！坚持住，丽！" 明日香瞄准了使徒，

fired her proton cannon. Her aim was perfect, the round hit directly in the center of the Angel's core. However it's AT Field prevented it from penetrating, shattering it into four separate chunks.  
她启动了质子加农炮。瞄准完美，炮弹正中天使核心。然而，其 AT 力场阻止了炮弹穿透，将其碎裂成四块。

"Its AT-Field is too powerful!" Hyuga exclaimed. "We can't hit it from this range!"  
“它的 AT 力场太强了！”日向惊呼，“我们在这个距离无法击中它！”

On the command center, Ikari's facial expression hardened as the scene unfold. The Angel was supposed to attack Unit 02, but now Rei was the target. Although Rei's body was replaceable, if her soul was destroyed… "Unit 02, assist Unit 00."  
指挥中心内，碇的脸色随着局势发展变得凝重。天使本应攻击二号机，现在却瞄准了零号机。尽管零的身体可替换，但如果她的灵魂被摧毁……“二号机，支援零号机。”

Asuka cursed internally as she heard the command. When she was attacked the commander did nothing but let Unit 00 watch at first, and he even kept Unit 01 in stasis. Now it was Rei being targeted, the Commander immediately ordered her to save her. What a humiliation.  
明日香在听到命令时暗自咒骂。当她被攻击时，指挥官什么也没做，只是让零号机在一旁观望，甚至让初号机保持静止状态。现在轮到绫波被针对了，指挥官立刻命令她去救她。真是耻辱。

Although she hated the order, she couldn't let Rei suffer. "Rei! I'm coming!" Asuka dropped her cannon and sprinted towards Unit 00 and pushed it aside. "Asuka! Retreat!"  
尽管她讨厌这个命令，但她不能让绫波受苦。“绫波！我来救你了！”明日香丢下炮台，向零号机冲去并将其推开。“明日香！撤退！”

But it was too late. The holy light shined on the crimson Evangelion.  
但为时已晚。圣光洒在了赤红的福音战士上。

"Arghhhhh!" Asuka screamed in pain as a familiar sensation hit her. 'I will not fail this time! I will SHOW YOU! I WILL SHOW YOU!' She summoned all her willpower to generate an inverse AT-Field, directed towards the Angel.  
"啊啊啊啊！" 明日香痛苦地尖叫，一种熟悉的感觉袭来。'这次我不会失败！我要向你展示！我会向你展示！' 她集中所有意志力，生成了一个反向 AT 力场，指向使徒。

"What is she doing?" Misato asked in horror.  
"她在做什么？" 美里惊恐地问道。

"I… I don't know," Ritsuko said, "The readings don't make sense…"  
"我…我不知道，" 律子说，"读数说不通…"

In orbit, the Angel suddenly felt something. Something it had never felt before.  
在轨道上，天使突然感受到了某种东西。某种它从未感受过的东西。

_Pain. Sorrow. Fear. Angst. Loneliness. Rage.  
痛苦。悲伤。恐惧。焦虑。孤独。愤怒。_

"Oh my God," Ritsuko finally realized the situation, "she's forcing the Angel to relive her memories with her!"  
“我的天啊，” 律子终于意识到情况，“她在强迫天使重温她与她的记忆！”

"What? How is that even possible?"  
"什么？这怎么可能？"

"Asuka's inverse AT-Field is resonating with the Angel's… and at an insane level of strength," Ritsuko explained, "whatever the Angel is doing to her is being mimicked perfectly by Asuka's AT-Field…"  
"明日香的反 AT 力场正在与使徒的产生共鸣…而且是以一种极其强大的强度，" 律子解释道，"使徒对她所做的一切，明日香的 AT 力场都在完美地模仿…"

"The Angel's AT-Field strength is rapidly decreasing!" Makoto reported. Just as he said, the Angel's body started to flicker.  
"使徒的 AT 力场强度正在迅速下降！" 真希波报告道。正如他所说，使徒的身体开始闪烁不定。"

"Asuka! Asuka! Father, let me help her! Let me go out there!" Shinji's voice came through the speakers, garnering the attention of everyone on the deck. "I'll take the shot!" Commander Ikari was about to open his mouth, but Major Katsuragi spun around and cut him off before he could get a word in. "Please, Commander Ikari!  
"明日香！明日香！父亲，让我帮她！让我出去！" 真嗣的声音通过扬声器传来，吸引了甲板上所有人的注意。"我来开枪！" 碇司令正要开口，但葛城美里少校转身抢在他之前打断了他。"请您，碇司令！"

You have to let Shinji go out there! The Angel's AT-Field is weakened!"  
您必须让真嗣出去！使徒的 AT 力场已经减弱了！

"Denied." Gendo said coldly. "Rei, retrieve the Lance."  
“驳回。”碇源堂冷冷地说道。“绫波，取回长枪。”

"Her sync ratio is only ten percent! She can't move her EVA!" Maya cried.  
“她的同步率只有百分之十！她无法移动她的 EVA！” 真希波喊道。

Commander frowned. He was planning to throw the Lance away so that SEELE can't commence their version of Instrumentality.  
司令皱起眉头。他原本计划丢弃这把长枪，以阻止 SEELE 启动他们的版本的人类补完计划。

However, now it seemed like only Unit D could do the job, but he still didn't want his son to know about the secret in Central Dogma.  
然而，现在看来似乎只有 D 型机能够完成这项任务，但他仍然不想让他的儿子知道中央教条区的秘密。

Weighting his choices, he decided the Lance could wait. "Send Unit D out to assist Unit 02 and Unit 00."  
权衡了他的选择后，他决定长矛可以稍等。“派出 D 单位去协助 02 和 00 单位。”

"Roger," Misato said, "Shinji, we'll send you to the nearest exit to Asuka's proton cannon, you'll use it to destroy the target, understood?"  
“收到，”美里说，“真嗣，我们会把你送到离明日香质子炮最近的出口，你要用它摧毁目标，明白吗？”

"Yes! Just launch me!"  
“是！快发射我吧！”

"EVA launch!" Misato didn't waste a second.  
“EVA 发射！”美里没有浪费一秒钟。

Unit D sprinted out the elevator and picked up the proton cannon that Asuka dropped. He took aim at the dimming Angel and fired. The mass of protons flew towards the bird-like creature and shattered its weakened AT-Field like a bullet penetrating cheap glass, piercing its core.  
D 型机从电梯中疾驰而出，捡起了明日香掉落的质子炮。他瞄准了逐渐黯淡的使徒，开火。质子群向那鸟状生物飞去，如同子弹穿透廉价玻璃般粉碎了它虚弱的 AT 力场，贯穿了其核心。

With a final wail, the Angel's great wings began to fade away, and its light dulled into nothing more than a flicker before fading away into nothing.  
随着最后一声哀鸣，使徒巨大的翅膀开始消散，它的光芒也黯淡成微弱的闪烁，最终消失无踪。

Shinji's entry plug opened up, spewing hundreds of gallons of LCL onto the floor as he slid down the emergency escape ladder. Once on the ground he sprinted towards Unit 02 and hit the exterior manual eject button on Unit 02's shoulder, causing its entry plug to shoot out of the back of its neck. Quickly making his way over to the plug, he watched as it opened up and the orange liquid flowed out of it. "Asuka?!" He called, running inside of the entry plug, finding the  
真嗣的插入栓打开，喷出数百加仑的 LCL 液体，洒落在地板上，他顺着紧急逃生梯滑下。一落地，他便朝零二号机狂奔，用力按下零二号机肩部的外部手动弹射按钮，导致其插入栓从后颈射出。他迅速赶到插入栓旁，看着它打开，橙色液体流出。“明日香？！”他呼喊着，冲进插入栓，发现

redheaded girl lying face up in the pilot's seat. "Asuka, it's me." He said as he stepped forward to get closer to her. "Are you alright?"  
红发女孩仰面躺在驾驶座上。“明日香，是我。”他边说边上前靠近她。“你还好吗？”

Asuka slowly opened her eyes and fixed her gaze on the source of the voice. She smiled weakly as she recognized the person, "Baka… I did it, didn't I?"  
明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，目光锁定声音的来源。她认出那个人后，虚弱地笑了笑，“笨蛋……我做到了，对吧？”

Shinji entered the entry plug and held Asuka tightly, gently stroking her hair. "Yes… Asuka… I don't know how you did it, but you weakened the Angel so I could kill it… I know you're the best, Asuka."  
真嗣进入插入栓，紧紧抱住明日香，轻抚她的头发。“是的……明日香……我不知道你是怎么做到的，但你削弱了使徒，让我能消灭它……我知道你是最棒的，明日香。”

Asuka smiled contently and closed her eyes as tiredness finally took over. Her sleeping face was peaceful as she had the best dream ever in two weeks.  
明日香满足地微笑着，终于疲惫地闭上了眼睛。她沉睡的面容安详，仿佛做着两周以来最美的梦。

Inside Unit 00, Rei curled up into a ball on her seat; although the pain had just subsided, she was aware of what happened during the whole battle. 'Sor-Asuka saved me and took the damage for me… Shinji killed the Angel for me…' She thought, 'and I remembered… what happened to the first me… they only think I'm a tool. They think I'm replaceable. I do not wish to be replaceable anymore. I am my own person. I am Rei Ayanami. I… I think I have made my decision.'  
在零号机内部，绫波丽蜷缩在座位上；尽管疼痛刚刚缓解，她清楚地记得整场战斗中发生的一切。‘索-明日香救了我，替我承受了伤害……真嗣为我消灭了使徒……’她想，‘而我记得……第一个我发生了什么……他们只把我当作工具。他们认为我是可替代的。我不想再被替代了。我是我自己。我是绫波丽。我……我想我已经做出了决定。’

big impact on him.  
对他影响巨大。

I do not own Evangelion. Chapter 14: Failure  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。第 14 章：失败

"Misato, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message after I've caused you so much trouble. I'm sorry. Please tell Asuka and Shinji that I'm sorry. And there's one more thing. I've been trying to grow some flowers. I'd appreciate it if you could water them for me. Shinji knows where they're at. And please don't dwell on the past. Just move ahead. And if somehow, I can see you again, I will say the words that I couldn't say eight years ago… Goodbye."  
美里，是我。我确信你会在我给你惹了这么多麻烦之后听到这条留言。对不起。请告诉明日香和真嗣，我也很抱歉。还有一件事。我一直在尝试种些花。如果你能帮我浇浇水，我会很感激的。真嗣知道它们在哪里。请不要沉溺于过去。继续前进。如果有可能，我再见到你时，我会说出八年前没能说出口的话……再见。

It's been the thirteenth time that Misato listened to this voicemail from her lover. Although Shinji had promised Kaji's safety, she couldn't help but feel deeply touched by his words. 'He could've died,' she thought, 'no, scratch that. He would be dead right now if Shinji doesn't have his powers, which he told me that it actually had happened in his timeline.'  
这已经是美里第十三次听她爱人的语音留言了。尽管真嗣曾保证加持的安全，但她仍不禁被他的话语深深打动。'他本可能丧命的，'她想，'不，应该说，如果没有真嗣的力量，他现在就已经死了，真嗣曾告诉我，在他的时间线上确实发生过这样的事。'

_Two days before the fight with Arael  
与 Arael 战斗的前两天_

_Misato laid her head down on her desk and let the tears flow as the sound of the answering machine beeped before rewinding the tape. Somehow she had managed to keep herself composed all the way up until now. She knew his gone. She didn't want to believe it. She didn't want to accept that her lover had been killed, and in a way, she was still hanging onto that hope. A body hadn't been presented to her, and with that came a sense of misplaced optimism. However this message all but sealed the deal. K aji was dead, and there was nothing she could do to change that. Feeling a presence behind her,  
美里将头靠在桌上，任由泪水流淌，答录机的哔声响起，随后磁带开始倒带。不知怎的，她一直强忍着情绪，直到此刻。她知道他已离去。她不愿相信，不愿接受她的爱人已被杀害，某种程度上，她仍抱着一线希望。没有人向她展示遗体，这带来了一种错位的乐观感。然而这条留言几乎成了定局。加持已逝，她无力改变这一事实。感受到身后有人，_

_Misato lifted her head and looked towards the door where the  
美里抬起头，望向门口，那里站着一个瘦高的少年身影。_

_silhouette of a lanky teenage boy stood before her. She tried to wipe away the tears from her bloodshot eyes, but it was too late. He had already seen everything that there was to see.  
她试图擦去充血眼睛中的泪水，但为时已晚。他已经看到了一切。_

_"Misato, are… are you alright?" Shinji asked in a concerning tone.  
“美里，你……你还好吗？”真嗣关切地问道。_

_She managed a faint smile at his concern, but it q uickly vanished. "Shinji, if you don't mind, I'd like to just be alone right now." She had to choke through her sobs to get the words out of her mouth. "Why don't you go to the arcade with your friends or something?"  
她勉强对他关切的表情露出一丝微笑，但很快便消失了。“真嗣，如果你不介意的话，我现在只想一个人静静。”她哽咽着，艰难地说出这些话。“你不如和朋友们去游戏厅什么的？”_

_"Misato-san… if it's because of K aji-san, don't worry about it. I… I made sure he's safe right now." Shinji smiled towards her. One thing about Shinji was that his smile had a strange power to just make people feel better.  
“美里小姐…如果是关于加持先生的事，别担心。我…我已经确保他现在安全了。”真嗣向她微笑。真嗣的笑容有一种奇妙的力量，能让人感觉好一些。_

_Of course, Misato knew what Shinji meant by that; after all, he had Angelic powers, and Shinji was the kind of person who would do anything to protect the people he cared about. In the original timeline, he tended to run away from his problems, but the presence of Asuka had changed everything. Even when he was not in love with her, Asuka could push him out from his shells. Now after all he's been through, added his promise to Asuka, he simply wouldn't let anyone he cared about getting hurt. "I… I believe you, Shinji-kun. T- Thanks."  
当然，美里明白真嗣的意思；毕竟，他拥有天使般的力量，而且真嗣是那种会不惜一切保护他在乎的人的人。在原时间线中，他往往逃避问题，但明日香的出现在改变了一切。即使他不爱她，明日香也能将他从壳中推出。现在经历了这么多，加上他对明日香的承诺，他绝不会让任何他在乎的人受到伤害。“我…我相信你，真嗣君。谢…谢谢。”_

_"No problem, Misato-san. I won't let it happen_ **again** _."_  
“没问题，美里小姐。我不会再让它发生了。”

Misato couldn't even imagine how her counterpart in Shinji's timeline had coped with the death of Kaji. 'probably cried my eyes out and abandoned everything else except finding out the truth,' she thought bitterly. Sighing, she grabbed another beer from the fridge. She heard that Asuka would be released tomorrow, which was a good sign since apparently they still don't know about her true origin.  
美里无法想象在真嗣的时间线中，自己是如何应对加持的死亡的。‘大概哭得眼睛都肿了，除了查明真相外，其他一切都放弃了，’她苦涩地想。叹了口气，她从冰箱里又拿了一罐啤酒。她听说明日香明天将被释放，这是个好迹象，因为显然他们还不知道她的真实身份。

Commander Ikari folded his hands over his mouth, exhaling into them. Despite the uneasiness that had begun to form between him  
碇司令双手交叠遮住口鼻，呼出一口气。尽管不安感开始在他心中滋生，

and Kaji, he really did not wish for this to happen. Ryoji had in a way kept the Committee off of his back by feeding them information, and now that he was gone, the old men would undoubtedly be coming at him with full force now. Now the MP EVAs was hearing completion, it seemed SEELE was coming very close to finishing their preparations for Instrumentality. That in turn also meant that they would be demanding he finish his end of it as soon as possible.  
而加治，他真的不希望这种情况发生。源堂通过向委员会提供信息，某种程度上让他们不再纠缠自己，而现在他不在了，那些老头子无疑会全力向他施压。现在 MP EVA 即将完工，看来 SEELE 离完成人类补完计划的准备越来越近了。这也意味着他们会要求他尽快完成自己的部分。

"I really hate those old bastards." He sighed. Fuyutsuki raised an eyebrow. Commander Ikari normally did pretty well when keeping a faç ade in regards to his superiors, but even the sturdiest of walls could crack if enough pressure was laid upon them. In a way the Sub-Commander felt as though this was a bad omen of sorts. For the years they had been working on the Human Instrumentality Project, Gendo always managed to keep himself composed in regards to SEELE. When most men would've cracked, Ikari would do little more than a smirk. Now it seemed that the old men were slowly tearing down the mental fortress Gendo had worked so hard to maintain.  
“我真的很讨厌那些老混蛋。”他叹了口气。冬月挑了挑眉。碇司令通常在上级面前表现得相当得体，但即使是再坚固的墙，如果承受足够的压力，也会出现裂缝。某种程度上，副司令觉得这像是一种不祥的预兆。多年来他们一直在进行人类补完计划，碇源堂总能保持镇定面对 SEELE。大多数人在这种情况下会崩溃，碇源堂最多只是冷笑一下。现在看来，那些老头子正慢慢摧毁碇源堂辛苦建立的心理防线。

"It doesn't matter," Kozo replied. "Even if they wanted to initiate Instrumentality today, they wouldn't be able to accomplish anything until the last two Angels are destroyed."  
"没关系，" 高雄回答道。"即使他们今天想要启动人类补完计划，他们也无法在最后两只使徒被消灭之前完成任何事情。"

"True. However, the old men know that we are nearing the end of this journey, and once they find out that our plans deviate from their own, they will not hesitate to have every single one of us killed." Gendo sighed again; now with the uncertainties caused by Asuka, he didn't even know whether his own plan could work anymore, much less SEELE's.  
"确实。然而，那些老头子知道我们即将结束这段旅程，一旦他们发现我们的计划与他们自己的不符，他们会毫不犹豫地杀死我们每一个人。" 碇叹了口气；现在由于明日香的不确定性，他甚至不知道自己的计划是否还能奏效，更不用说 SEELE 的了。"

"Even so, they can't do anything to us as long as the Angels are still a threat."  
"即便如此，只要使徒仍然构成威胁，他们就无法对我们采取任何行动。"

"That's the only thing stopping them." His eyes rose up to Fuyutsuki. "And while we plan out our next move to combat the Angels, SEELE is already making the preparations to annihilate us if need be."  
“那是唯一阻止他们的东西。”他的目光抬向了冬月。“在我们计划下一步如何对抗使徒时，SEELE 已经在准备必要时将我们彻底消灭。”

"We have the EVA Units, though." His advisor spoke, returning the glance. "Unit 00, D, and 02 can take on anything the UN's military can throw at us. Unless of course, they plan on using the MP EVAs for battle."  
“但我们有 EVA 单位。”他的顾问回望道，“00 号、D 号和 02 号机体足以应对联合国军队的任何攻击。除非他们打算使用 MP EVA 进行战斗。”

"And that's exactly what they'll do." The elderly man narrowed his eyes and turned all the way towards Commander Ikari, a quizzical look on his face. "But the MPs are too valuable for them to risk losing. Besides that, it's common knowledge that they are inferior to Unit 00, D, and 02 in every possible way. Even with their flight capabilities, they lack reliable ranged combat weaponry, making it entirely moot."  
“那正是他们会做的。”老人眯起眼睛，完全转向碇司令，脸上带着疑惑的表情。“但 MP 机体对他们来说太过珍贵，不愿冒险损失。此外，众所周知，它们在各个方面都不如 00 号、D 号和 02 号机体。即使拥有飞行能力，它们也缺乏可靠的远程战斗武器，这使得其作用大打折扣。”

"Fuyutsuki," He could actually hear Gendo smirk. "I thought you'd be smarter than that. You know that SEELE always likes to keep their secrets. There is far more about the MP EVAs we don't know."  
"冬月," 他甚至能听到碇的冷笑。"我以为你会更聪明些。你知道 SEELE 总是喜欢保守他们的秘密。关于 MP EVA，我们还有很多不知道的。"

Fuyutsuki lowered his eyebrows, "Regardless, we still need to fight them. What are you gonna do with the Second Child, anyway? Is it wise to eliminate one of our pilots? She could contribute greatly in defending the GeoFront when the time comes."  
冬月皱起眉头，"无论如何，我们仍然需要与他们战斗。你打算怎么处理二号适格者？消除我们的一个驾驶员明智吗？当需要保卫第三新东京市时，她可能会做出巨大贡献。"

"The Second Child had already introduced too many disturbances into the scenario. I'd rather have the Second Child eliminated than go on with all of the uncertainties. Moreover, Shinji would break down and become a robot to us if she's dead. However, for now I'd like to release the Second Child from custody; she hadn't proposed any type of threat to us; besides, if she really is an Angel, we couldn't really do anything to stop her. There's no need to keep her in that room if we can't find anything wrong about the Second Child."  
"二号适格者已经给计划带来了太多干扰。我宁愿消除二号适格者，也不愿继续面对所有的不确定性。此外，如果她死了，真嗣会崩溃并变成对我们来说的机器人。不过，目前我想将二号适格者从拘留中释放出来；她没有对我们构成任何形式的威胁；而且，如果她真的是使徒，我们也无法真正阻止她。如果找不到二号适格者的任何问题，就没有必要让她继续待在那间房间里。"

The Sub-Commander looked down at his feet. In a way, he was happy to hear that SEELE wouldn't have their way in the end, but at the same time, the fact that Gendo would be getting his was just as disheartening. Adding the fact that Commander Ikari had his plan to eliminate one of their most experienced pilots was not comforting, either. Though the Commander may have claimed that this was all  
副司令低头看着自己的脚。某种程度上，他听到 SEELE 最终无法得逞的消息感到高兴，但与此同时，碇源堂也将得偿所愿的事实同样令人沮丧。再加上碇司令有计划要除掉他们最经验丰富的驾驶员，这一点也并不令人安心。尽管司令可能声称这一切都是为了

for Yui, it had become quite clear that he was doing all of this for himself.  
唯，但很明显，他做这一切都是为了自己。

Asuka had been reading manga ever since she came back from the fight with Arael. She was in a great mood since she had taken avenge against the three Angels that caused her mental breakdown in her timeline, added that she didn't get retrained since then. She was humming when Ritsuko entered the ward with a fake smile; her mood immediately went down and a scowl appeared on her face, not unnoticed by the blonde. Now wanting to get into any kind of argument, she simply said, "Asuka, pack up your stuff. You can leave whenever you're ready."  
自从与亚拉尔战斗归来后，明日香一直在看漫画。她心情大好，因为她已经为那三个导致她在自己时间线精神崩溃的天使报了仇，再加上她没有因此受到任何惩罚。她正哼着歌，这时律子带着假笑走进病房；明日香的心情立刻低落下来，脸上露出了不悦的表情，这一点没有逃过金发女子的眼睛。不想卷入任何争吵，她只是简单地说：“明日香，收拾好你的东西。你随时可以离开。”

Asuka's scowl immediately turned into an overjoyed smile but soon died down and degenerated into a skeptical face, "Why? Why all the sudden?"  
明日香的脸色立刻转为欣喜的笑容，但很快又沉了下来，变成了怀疑的表情，“为什么？怎么突然之间？”

"It's a direct order from Commander Ikari; besides, we can't find any anomalies in you."  
“这是碇司令的直接命令；而且，我们也没在你身上发现任何异常。”

Asuka's expression softened a bit, "Well, of course you can't find any anomalies since I am perfectly normal!" Not wasting a second, she got up from the bed and grabbed her clothes from the wardrobe. "Is Misato going to pick me up? Or Section 2?"  
明日香的神情稍稍缓和，“当然找不到异常了，因为我本来就很正常！”她毫不犹豫地从床上起身，从衣柜里抓起衣服。“是美里来接我吗？还是第二课的人？”

"Major Katsuragi will come here in thirty minutes," Ritsuko replied.  
“葛城少校将在三十分钟后到达这里，”律子回答道。

"Wunderbar. Now get out, I'm gonna change!" Asuka demanded. Although Dr. Akagi was a woman, she knew for a fact that Ritsuko was bisexual. Her relationship with Maya couldn't escape from her eyes.  
“太好了。现在出去，我要换衣服了！”明日香命令道。尽管赤城博士是女性，但她确信律子是双性恋。她和真嗣的关系逃不过她的眼睛。

"What's the problem? I'm a doctor, and I've done several physicals on you. It's not like I haven't seen it before." Ritsuko said with a smirk. Another thing she didn't tell Asuka was that there were cameras mounted inside the First Cranial Nerve ward specifically  
“有什么问题吗？我是医生，给你做过好几次体检了。又不是没见过。”律子带着一丝戏谑说道。她没告诉明日香的另一件事是，第一神经外科病房里装有摄像头。

designed to monitor energy patterns, however they do not lack video recording capabilities.  
旨在监测能量模式，但它们并不缺乏视频录制功能。

Asuka huffed, "Just get out! It's still embarrassing!" The truth was Asuka was well aware of the presence of the cameras; it became her natural instinct after her Angelic powers had awakened. She didn't want to change under surveillance cameras, however she also knew acting strangely would raise suspicions. After all, she was not supposed to know about the hidden cameras.  
明日香哼了一声，“快出去！还是很尴尬！”事实上，明日香很清楚摄像头的存在；自从她的使徒力量觉醒后，这已成为她的本能。她不想在监控摄像头下换衣服，但她也知道行为异常会引起怀疑。毕竟，她不应该知道隐藏的摄像头。

Ritsuko sighed in defeat; she knew the girl could be very stubborn sometimes. Actually, she was surprised to see Asuka was behaving much less violently than she had anticipated. "Fine. Be quick." She left the room without another word.  
律子叹了口气，认输了；她知道这女孩有时非常固执。实际上，她很惊讶看到明日香表现得比她预想的要平和得多。“好吧。快点。”她没再多说一句话就离开了房间。

Asuka swiftly took off her hospital gown and put on her school uniform; she didn't want to give any cheap peeks to the old perverts working for NERV surveillance department. She then exited the ward and sat down on the chair, waiting for Misato to come and pick her up.  
明日香迅速脱下病号服，换上校服；她可不想让 NERV 监控部门那些老色鬼占到任何便宜。随后，她走出病房，坐在椅子上，等待美里来接她。

"Asuka!" Misato's cheerful voice came from the end of the hallway, effectively waking Asuka up from her dizziness caused by 30 minutes of waiting. She yawned and looked up, "Eh? Hi! Misato!"  
“明日香！”美里欢快的声音从走廊尽头传来，有效地将明日香从因等待 30 分钟而引起的眩晕中唤醒。她打了个哈欠，抬头看去，“诶？嗨！美里！”

The lavender-haired Major sprinted towards the redhead and gave her a fierce hug, burying her head into her chest. "Emmm… Asuka- chan, I've missed you so much!"  
紫发的少校快步向红发少女跑去，给了她一个紧紧的拥抱，将头埋在她的胸前。“嗯……明日香酱，我好想你！”

Asuka stayed in that position for a while; normally she would have pulled away already since she disliked Misato's lousy behaviors most of the time. However, after being put in a ward for so long, she craved human contact from someone she trusted. Minutes later she finally pulled away, "Misato, I've missed you too!" She smiled widely. Looking around, Asuka noticed someone was missing. "Where's that idiot?"  
明日香保持着那个姿势好一会儿；通常她早就推开了，毕竟她大多数时候都不喜欢美里那些糟糕的行为。然而，在病房里待了这么久，她渴望来自她信任的人的温暖。几分钟后她终于抽身，“美里，我也好想你！”她笑得灿烂。环顾四周，明日香发现少了个人。“那个笨蛋去哪儿了？”

"Shin-chan's at home cooking some secret German meal for you. He said it will take some time and he'd rather have it ready when you get home."  
“真嗣在家给你做一道神秘的德国菜。他说需要些时间，希望你回家时已经准备好了。”

Asuka pouted in annoyance. She really wanted to hug and kiss Shinji senseless right now, but apparently, she would have to wait for another hour or so. However, she did appreciate Shinji's actions, which made her more anxious since she really wanted to try the food. "Then let's not waste a minute." Asuka said, her stomach made some growling noises, "Let's get going already!"  
明日香不满地撅嘴。她现在真的很想紧紧拥抱并亲吻真嗣，但显然还得再等一个小时左右。不过，她确实感激真嗣的举动，这让她更加期待尝试那道菜，心里越发焦急。“那我们别浪费时间了。”明日香说，她的肚子咕噜作响，“快点出发吧！”

"We are home!" Asuka and Misato announced and quickly shoveled their shoes off. "Asuka! Welcome home!" Came Shinji's excited cry; he immediately dropped the pots and pans on the stove and rushed to the hallway. Upon seeing his favorite redhead, wide smiles exploded on both of their faces; they ran toward each other, intending to hug each other fiercely and kiss senseless, while Misato simply stood in the hallway watching the whole ordeal with a warm smile.  
“我们到家了！”明日香和美里宣布着，迅速脱下鞋子。“明日香！欢迎回家！”真嗣兴奋地喊道；他立刻放下手中的锅碗瓢盆，冲向走廊。一看到他最爱的红发女孩，两人脸上都绽放出灿烂的笑容；他们跑向对方，打算紧紧拥抱并深情亲吻，而美里则站在走廊里，带着温暖的微笑看着这一切。

And Shinji tripped on the floor.  
然后真嗣在地板上绊了一跤。

The tremendous momentum he carried sent him flying forward and his head crashed right into Asuka's chest. They both fell to the floor with Asuka at the bottom, which ended up in a very compromising position. "Urghh…" Asuks groaned in pain and annoyance; shaking her head to clear her vision, she saw their current position and immediately blushed bright red. "Baka!" She smacked Shinji's head lightly, "Get off me before Misa-" Her talking was interrupted by thunder-loud laughter from behind.  
他巨大的冲力使他向前飞去，头正好撞在明日香的胸口。两人一起摔倒在地，明日香垫在下面，形成了一个非常尴尬的姿势。“呃……”明日香痛苦又恼怒地呻吟着；她摇摇头想恢复视线，看到他们现在的姿势，立刻脸红得像熟透的苹果。“笨蛋！”她轻轻拍了拍真嗣的头，“快从我身上下来，不然美里——”她的话被身后雷鸣般的笑声打断了。

"Hahahahahahahaha…" Misato also fell to the floor, rolling and laughing, failing to control her composure. The recent days had been too much pressure for her; she figured she could use the moment to relieve the stress.  
"哈哈哈哈哈哈哈…" 美里也倒在地上，滚来滚去地大笑，无法控制自己的情绪。最近的日子对她来说压力太大了；她觉得可以借此机会释放一下压力。

"OMMMPPHH-Ah!" Shinji quickly lifted his head up from Asuka's chest, "S-sorry! I-I tripped!" His face blushed as well, but he didn't mind the incident, though. Neither did Asuka, except that she was annoyed by Misato's behavior.  
"呃唔-啊！" 真嗣迅速从明日香的胸前抬起头，"对-对不起！我-我绊倒了！" 他的脸也红了，但他并不介意这个小插曲。明日香也一样，只是对美里的行为感到有些恼火。

"Hmph, you can appreciate them _later_," Asuka said in a playful grin, causing Shinji to blush deeper. "Now get up. I want to know what my dearest Baka made me for dinner."  
"哼，你可以晚点再欣赏，" 明日香带着调皮的笑容说，这让真嗣的脸更红了。"现在起来吧。我想知道我最亲爱的笨蛋给我做了什么晚餐。"

"Ah, y-ye-Oh Shit!" Shinji suddenly remembered he didn't turn off the  
“啊，糟了！” 真嗣突然想起他没关掉

stove, and a smell of something overcooked was spreading in the house. He hurriedly stood up and rushed to the kitchen. Seconds later the sound of dumping overcooked steak and a loud groan could be heard, causing Asuka to sigh. 'What an anticlimactic way of reunion…' She shook her head and looked around, fixing her gaze at the oxygen-depraving Major. "Oi, Misato!" She tried to snap Misato out of her laughter by shaking her shoulder, "Get out of it before I use you as my Karate punch bag!"  
炉子，一股焦糊味正在屋内蔓延。他急忙起身冲向厨房。几秒钟后，传来倒掉烧焦牛排的声音和一声沉重的叹息，这让明日香叹了口气。‘真是扫兴的重逢方式……’她摇摇头，环顾四周，目光定格在缺氧的少校身上。“喂，美里！”她试图通过摇晃她的肩膀来唤醒美里，“清醒点，不然我可要把你当我的空手道沙袋了！”

Whether it was fear or oxygen deprivation, the Major finally stopped laughing, panting heavily. "Y-you two are so adorable, I just feel so happy for you!" Indeed Misato had always wanted her charges to be happy, and that was the main reason she arranged those two pilots to live together, hoping they could get along. Knowing her plan had worked in three different universes had been such a source of the sense of achievement for her.  
无论是恐惧还是缺氧，少校终于停止了笑声，喘着粗气。“你们俩太可爱了，我真为你们高兴！”确实，美里一直希望她的孩子们能幸福，这也是她安排这两位驾驶员同居的主要原因，希望他们能和睦相处。知道她的计划在三个不同的宇宙中都成功了，这让她感到无比的成就感。

"It's not like I need you to remind me that!" Asuka pouted, "Hmph, but thanks, anyway."  
"我又不需要你提醒我这个！" 明日香噘嘴道，"哼，不过还是谢谢了。"

Misato finally got up from the floor, wiping out her tears. "Yeah, yeah. Just make sure me as your bridesmaid."  
美里终于从地板上站了起来，擦干眼泪。"是啊，是啊。只要确保我是你的伴娘就行了。"

Asuka's face blushed a little once more. Of course, she didn't want anyone except Shinji as her husband, she still thought it as distant. They still had much more pressing matters to deal with, after all. "I'll  
明日香的脸颊再次微微泛红。当然，除了真嗣她不想任何人成为她的丈夫，但她仍觉得这很遥远。毕竟，他们还有更多紧迫的事情要处理。"我会

consider it. Maybe after you and Kaji-right, where is he?" Asuka  
"考虑一下吧。或许在你和加持之后——对了，他现在在哪儿？" 明日香

looked around worriedly as she remembered what had happened to him in her timeline.  
她焦急地环顾四周，想起了他在自己时间线中遭遇的事情。

"Don't worry, Shin-chan had taken care of it. That jerk's probably hiding somewhere right now." Misato's expression suddenly clouded a little; clearly, she was still worried about him.  
“别担心，真嗣已经处理好了。那家伙现在估计正躲在某个地方呢。”美里脸上的表情突然有些阴沉；显然，她仍然对他放心不下。

"I know I can always trust the Baka," Asuka smiled, "Hey, Shinji! What's for dinner?" She shouted to the kitchen.  
"我知道我可以永远相信笨蛋," 明日香微笑着说, "嘿, 真嗣! 晚饭吃什么?" 她朝厨房喊道.

"Ah, some Schweinshaxe, Schweinebraten, and Sauerbraten," Shinji replied, "there was steak as well, but…"  
"啊, 有烤猪肘、烤猪肉和酸菜炖肉," 真嗣回答, "还有牛排, 但是…"

"WHOA, that's so much meat," Asuka said, "It's not like I don't like them, but are you trying to get me fat or something?"  
"哇, 这么多肉," 明日香说, "我不是不喜欢, 但你是不是想让我变胖还是怎么的?"

Shinji scratched his head, "Well… I didn't make much since it's my first time, so no worry about calories or fat."  
真嗣挠了挠头，"嗯…因为是第一次做，所以没放多少东西，不用担心卡路里或脂肪。"

"Hmph, I hope having an… S2 organ doesn't make all things I eat into fat, because I'd stop eating anything if that's the case."  
"哼，希望拥有…S2 器官不会让我吃什么都变胖，否则我可能就什么都不吃了。"

"Well, I don't see you get any fatter…" Shinji chuckled, "your body's still beautiful."  
"嗯，我看你也没变胖…" 真嗣轻笑道，"你的身材依旧很美。"

Asuka just blushed a little and said nothing, but she failed to hide her grin.  
明日香只是微微脸红，一言不发，但她没能藏住嘴角的笑意。

"Dinner's ready!" Shinji yelled into the living room where his two roommates were watching some soap TV show together. He placed three plates on the table; each of them had an equal share of the food he made. He then prepared the dish for PenPen, who 'wark'ed happily and started digging into it.  
“晚饭好了！”真嗣对着客厅大喊，他的两位室友正一起看肥皂剧。他在桌上摆了三盘，每盘都盛着他做的等量食物。接着，他为 PenPen 准备了一道菜，它高兴地“哇”了一声，开始大快朵颐。

The trio ate their food in almost silence with occasional praises from the Major. As for Asuka, the food was simply too good to stop and catch a breath. Devouring all the content in the plate in record time,  
三人几乎默默地吃着，少校偶尔会称赞几句。至于明日香，食物实在太美味，让她停不下来喘口气。她以创纪录的速度吃光了盘中的所有食物，

the redhead wiped her mouth, a content smile on her face. After all, she had been fed glucose and junk cafeteria food for the past weeks. "That was… more than acceptable," Asuka said, "but… don't you dare stop it."  
"红发女孩擦了擦嘴，脸上挂着满足的微笑。毕竟，过去几周她吃的都是食堂的糖分和垃圾食品。“那真是……超出预期的好，”明日香说，“但是……你可别停下。””

Shinji just chuckled hearing the words. He knew all too well what she meant by her words; being tsundere, or more _dere,_ had always meant Asuka being in a great mood. "Anything for Mein Liebling."  
"听到这些话，真嗣只是轻声笑了笑。他非常清楚她话中的含义；作为傲娇，或者说更偏向娇的一面，明日香总是心情很好。“为了我的甜心，什么都愿意。””

"Hmph, since when you learned to be a sweet-talker?" Asuka asked in a devious grin, "I guess I trained you well."  
"“哼，你什么时候学会甜言蜜语了？”明日香带着狡黠的笑容问道，“看来我把你训练得不错。””

"Trained? What, you think Shin-chan as your pet or something?" Misato turned her head towards the redhead, a playful smile on her face.  
"训练过？什么，你把真嗣当成你的宠物还是怎么的？" 美里转向红发女孩，脸上带着调皮的笑容。

"Hmmm? What, of course not! At least he's MY pet, and I'm not gonna share with you!"  
"嗯？什么，当然不是！至少他是我的宠物，我才不会跟你分享呢！"

Shinji saw his two roommates were about to start another pointless argument, he decided to change the subject, "Ah, Asuka, since they released you, are you gonna go back to pilot?"  
真嗣看到他的两位室友又要开始一场无谓的争吵，他决定换个话题，"啊，明日香，既然他们放你出来了，你打算回去驾驶 EVA 吗？"

Asuka turned to look at Shinji, tilting her head, "Well, I don't know exactly. But since they already allowed me to fight Arael, I guess it's a yes."  
明日香转头看向真嗣，歪着头说，“嗯，我也不确定。但既然他们已经允许我与亚拉尔战斗了，我想应该是可以的。”

"Right, I forgot to tell you," Misato said, "your next sync test is this Saturday, in Unit 02."  
“对了，我忘了告诉你，”美里说，“你下一次同步测试是这周六，在二号机上。”

Asuka was more than happy to hear that. She hadn't had a good opportunity to talk to her mother ever since she came here. There were too many things happening, and they prevented her from sitting in Unit 02's entry plug for hours undisturbed. Now the chance came to her, and she intended to make full use of it. "Wunderbar! Momma, wait for me!"  
听到这个消息，明日香非常高兴。自从来到这里，她一直没有机会好好和母亲交谈。太多事情接连发生，让她无法在二号机的插入栓里不受打扰地坐上几个小时。现在机会来了，她打算充分利用。“太棒了！妈妈，等我！”

"Insert Entry Plug. Entry Plug inserted. Commence Entry Plug LCL injection. LCL filled. Establishing A10 connections. A-10 connections established and stable. All circuits are operational. Absolute Borderline passed. Stable synchronization established… sync rate holding steady at ninety two percent." Maya reported, a smile appearing on her face. "Evangelion Unit 02 activated."  
插入插入栓。插入栓已插入。开始注入插入栓 LCL。LCL 已充满。建立 A10 连接。A-10 连接已建立并稳定。所有电路正常运行。通过绝对领域界限。稳定同步已建立……同步率保持在 92%。" 真希报告道，脸上露出了微笑。"二号机启动。"

It was the first sync test after the incident with the eleventh Angel, and Shinji came here as well. Inside the entry plug of Unit 02, Asuka closed her eyes as a familiar warmth wrapped around her body. She cleared her thoughts and tried to reach out to the soul inside the EVA. 'Momma?'  
这是在与第十一使徒事件后的首次同步测试，真嗣也来到了这里。在二号机的插入栓内，明日香闭上眼睛，感受着熟悉的温暖包裹着她的身体。她清空思绪，试图触及 EVA 内部的灵魂。'妈妈？'

_Mein Liebling 我的宝贝_

Asuka was more than happy to get a reaction out from her EVA, and she kept pressing on.' Momma! It's Asuka!'  
明日香非常高兴能从她的 EVA 中得到反应，她继续喊道：'妈妈！是明日香！'

_Mein Liebling 我的宝贝_

'Momma! I-I've missed you a lot!'  
'妈妈！我...我非常想念你！'

_Mein Liebling 我的宝贝_

Now Asuka felt genuinely confused. 'M-Momma?'  
现在，明日香真的感到困惑了。'妈——妈妈？'

_Mein Liebling 我的宝贝_

'Her only reaction to my thoughts is 'my love?" Asuka thought with a slight frown on her face, 'Just like…' suddenly, the realization dawned on her. 'I get it. This is the part of my mother got absorbed into Unit 02. She can't do anything but love me. And the other part of her soul remained in her body after the contact experiment, which made her into…' She shook off her thoughts. It hurt a lot to Asuka that she couldn't hold a proper conversation with her mother anymore, but at least she knew her mother was always with her and loving her.  
“她对我的想法唯一的反应就是‘我的爱？’”明日香皱着眉头想，“就像……”突然，她恍然大悟。“我明白了。这是我母亲被吸收进二号机的那部分。她除了爱我什么也做不了。而她灵魂的另一部分在接触实验后留在了她的身体里，这使她变成了……”她甩开这些思绪。对明日香来说，无法再与母亲进行正常的对话让她非常痛苦，但至少她知道母亲一直与她同在，并且爱着她。

'I-I'll see you around, Momma.'  
“我-我会再见到你的，妈妈。”

_Wiedersehen Mein Liebling  
再见，我的宝贝_

Asuka smiled a little and cleared her thoughts, concentrating on synchronization.  
明日香微微一笑，清空思绪，专注于同步率。

"Senpai, you may want to have a look," Maya said, her eyes fixing on the screen reporting status of Unit 02.  
「前辈，你可能需要看一下。」真希波说，目光紧盯着显示二号机状态的屏幕。

Ritsuko came behind Maya, her right arm resting on the back of the chair, "What is it?" She asked, pushing her glasses back into place, "Oh my God… Asuka's sync ratio is holding steady at one hundred and thirty-five percent? How is this even possible without dual- syncing?" Although she knew it was possible for sync ratios to go above one hundred percent, she never thought anything like this would happen in sync tests. She opened a communication channel to Unit 02 and said, "Asuka, how are you feeling?"  
律子走到真希波身后，右臂搭在椅背上，「怎么了？」她问道，推了推眼镜，「我的天……明日香的同步率稳定在百分之一百三十五？没有双重同步怎么可能做到这一点？」尽管她知道同步率超过百分之一百是有可能的，但她从未想过会在同步测试中发生这样的事。她打开与二号机的通讯频道，问道：「明日香，你感觉如何？」

"Feeling Great!" Came in Asuka's cheerful voice, "How am I doing?"  
"感觉棒极了！" 明日香欢快的声音传来，"我表现得怎么样？"

"Your sync ratio is currently holding at one hundred and thirty-five percent, breaking all of our former records," Ritsuko said. She didn't really like the loud and noisy redhead, added their earlier unpleasant encounters, she couldn't help but feel half-proud, half-surprised at Asuka's performance. After all, this would certainly help improve her mood, which would do good for everyone.  
"你的同步率目前稳定在百分之一百三十五，打破了我们以往的所有记录，" 律子说道。她并不真正喜欢那个吵闹的红发女孩，再加上之前的几次不愉快遭遇，她不禁对明日香的表现感到一半自豪，一半惊讶。毕竟，这肯定会改善她的心情，这对大家都有好处。

"You are doing great, Asuka!" Shinji said happily into the comms. He was a little bit surprised at her sync ratio as well.  
"你做得很好，明日香！" 真嗣开心地对着通讯器说。他对她的同步率也感到有些惊讶。

"What do you expect from your best pilot? After all I saved your asses several times already!" Asuka exclaimed proudly, making Shinji giggle.  
"你对你最好的飞行员有什么期待？毕竟我已经救过你们好几次了！" 明日香自豪地喊道，让真嗣忍不住笑了起来。

Ritsuko simply snorted at the casual show-off, "Asuka, while higher sync ratios mean better performance, it will also bring more pain, possibly real physical harm if you stay above one hundred percent."  
律子只是对这种随意的炫耀嗤之以鼻，"明日香，虽然同步率越高意味着表现越好，但同时也会带来更多痛苦，如果保持在百分之一百以上，甚至可能造成真正的身体伤害。"

"I know, I know. I'm sure it'll be easy to keep it at ninety-nine point nine percent, right?" Asuka said sarcastically, "I thought this is more of your job!"  
"我知道，我知道。我肯定保持百分之九十九点九的同步率很容易，对吧？" 明日香讽刺地说，"我以为这更应该是你的工作！"

Ritsuko sighed. 'I knew it's not a good idea to even talk to her.' "Maya, lower the plug depth and see what happens."  
律子叹了口气。'我就知道跟她说话准没好事。'“真嗣，降低插入栓深度，看看会发生什么。”

"Hai." Maya said, "Lowering plug depth by ten." She typed a few keystrokes into the terminal and waited for the reaction.  
“明白。”真嗣回应道，“将插入栓深度降低十。”她在终端上敲击了几下键盘，然后等待着反应。

Inside the entry plug, Asuka suddenly felt things changed around her; her connection to EVA became much more intricate and clearer.  
在插入栓内部，明日香突然感觉到周围环境发生了变化；她与 EVA 的连接变得更加复杂且清晰。

_Mein Liebling Mein Liebling Mein Liebling Mein Liebling  
我的宝贝我的宝贝我的宝贝我的宝贝_

'M-Momma? Why are there two voices?'  
'妈咪？为什么有两个声音？'

_Mein Liebling Mein Liebling Mein Liebling Die… with me  
我的宝贝我的宝贝我的宝贝和我一起…死去_

Asuka felt a chill run down her spine as she heard the words, cold sweat and goosebumps appeared on her skin. 'What the hell? Who are you?'  
明日香听到这些话时，感到一股寒意沿着脊背直窜而下，冷汗和鸡皮疙瘩瞬间遍布她的肌肤。'搞什么鬼？你是谁？'

_Mein Liebling Die with me…  
我的爱人，与我同葬…_

'No! You are not Momma!' Asuka yelled mentally, 'Give me my Momma!'  
'不！你不是妈妈！' 明日香在心中呐喊，'把妈妈还给我！'

_Mein Liebling 我的宝贝_

_DIE WITH ME, Asuka! 和我一起死吧，明日香！_

"Senpai! Asuka's sync ratio has jumped to three hundred and seventy percent!" Maya cried, "her synchrograph is all over the place!"  
前辈！明日香的同步率飙升到了三百七十个百分点！" 真希波喊道，"她的同步仪完全失控了！

"What's "What's happening?" Shinji asked worriedly, "Asuka, are you okay?" He knew perfectly what it meant to have such a high sync ratio.  
"发生了什么事？" 真嗣担忧地问道，"明日香，你还好吗？" 他完全明白如此高的同步率意味着什么。

Ritsuko shivered at the words; looking at the readings she found something disturbing, "Pilot's ego barrier is breaching! Stop the test! If the sync ratio goes to four hundred, she'll lose her physical form!"  
听到这些话，律子不禁打了个寒颤；看着读数，她发现了一些令人不安的情况，"驾驶员的自我屏障正在崩溃！停止测试！如果同步率升至四百，她将失去物理形态！"

"Hai, Senpai!" Maya pressed on the emergency stop button. "Signal received! Plug ejected!"  
"是，前辈！" 玛雅按下了紧急停止按钮。"信号已接收！插入栓已弹出！"

Asuka suddenly felt all the voices and connections severed, and her surroundings went cold. Sighing, she knew something had gone terribly wrong.  
明日香突然感到所有的声音和联系都被切断，周围变得冰冷。她叹了口气，知道一定出了什么严重的问题。

'Momma…' '妈妈…'

Ten minutes later she met Shinji in the hallway leading to the changing room. Making a weak smile, she spoke first, "Shinji, I met my Momma. But it didn't go well."  
十分钟后，她在通往更衣室的走廊里遇到了真嗣。她勉强笑了笑，先开口说道：“真嗣，我见到了我妈妈。但情况并不好。”

"What happened? Your sync ratio had gone close to four hundred! A little higher we would lose you!" Shinji's expression nothing but concern.  
“发生了什么？你的同步率接近四百了！再高一点我们就会失去你！” 真嗣的脸上满是担忧。

Asuka sighed, "Shinji, remember I told you… about how my mother? How she became after the contact experiment?" Seeing Shinji nodding slowly, she continued, "I think… her soul split in two… after the plug depth was lowered, I began hearing two voices… one was my Momma, loving me. And the other… wanted me to die with her."  
明日香叹了口气，“真嗣，记得我告诉过你……关于我母亲的事吗？她接触实验后变得怎样了？”看到真嗣缓缓点头，她继续说道，“我想……她的灵魂分裂了……在插入栓深度降低后，我开始听到两个声音……一个是妈妈，爱着我。而另一个……想要我和她一起死。”

Shinji gulped hard hearing the words, "A-Asuka… I… will it be safe  
真嗣听到这些话，艰难地咽了口唾沫，“明-明日香……我……这样安全吗？”

for you to go in there again? What if…"  
还要你再进去一次？万一……"

Asuka waved her hand to cut Shinji off, "Don't worry, as long as the plug depth remains normal, there won't be a problem." She sighed in annoyance; she had thought today would be her tearful reunion with her mother, however things went terribly wrong. Asuka wanted to lighten the mood, so she decided to change the subject. "Anyways, I heard Misato is going to put me back to school. Is there any point in doing so? I've already missed so many, not to mention I have my college degree."  
明日香挥手打断了真嗣，"别担心，只要插入栓深度正常，就不会有问题。"她烦躁地叹了口气；本以为今天会是与母亲感人重逢的日子，结果却出了大岔子。明日香想缓和气氛，于是决定换个话题。"话说回来，我听说美里要让我重新上学。这有什么意义吗？我已经缺了那么多课，更别说我已经有大学学位了。"

Shinji chuckled, "Asuka, it's just for socializing purposes."  
真嗣轻笑道，"明日香，这只是为了社交而已。"

"Hmph, I don't see there's any need doing so since I have you now." "Well, you got to spend more time with me, wouldn't it be great?  
""哼，既然我现在有你了，我看没必要这么做。""“嗯，你能多陪我一会儿，不是很好吗？”

Horaki-san and Toji had gone back to school earlier, and she missed you, too."  
“堀崎同学和东治早些时候已经回学校了，她也很想你。”

Asuka thought about the proposal for a while. The truth was she couldn't really see any drawbacks to the plan, and it was true that she needed fresh air. "Fine. I'll go, but only under one condition - you'd better not slack off on making Bentos! And I want more German food!"  
“明日香考虑了一会儿这个提议。事实上，她看不出这个计划有什么缺点，而且她的确需要呼吸新鲜空气。“好吧。我会去，但只有一个条件——你最好别在准备便当上偷懒！而且我要更多德国菜！”

The weekend came and went, and it was time for Asuka to rejoin the place she despised for so many reasons. The trip to school was uneventful, aside from few confused or surprised glances from their schoolmates. Asuka was at first a little confused about her schoolmates' reactions; then she remembered she had said she was a clone. No wonder no one wanted to come near to her anymore.  
周末转瞬即逝，到了 Asuka 不得不重返那个她因诸多原因而深恶痛绝的地方的时候。去学校的路上平淡无奇，除了几个同学投来的困惑或惊讶的目光。起初，Asuka 对同学们的反应感到有些不解；随即她记起自己曾说过她是个克隆人。难怪现在没人愿意靠近她了。

Not that she minded, tho.  
不过，她并不介意。

Stepping into the classroom, Asuka quickly drew a lot of attention from her classmates. She filtered out the gossips of them and walked towards her seat like nothing happened. She also noticed that Rei was absent.  
走进教室，Asuka 立刻吸引了众多同学的目光。她无视了他们的窃窃私语，径直走向自己的座位，仿佛什么都没发生。同时，她也注意到 Rei 今天没来。

"Asuka!" She turned around to see a double-pig-tailed brunette smiling widely running towards her.  
"明日香！" 她转过身，看到一位扎着双马尾的棕发女孩正笑容满面地向她跑来。

'Of course, the first one to greet me is Hikari,' She thought. "Hello, Hikari!" She opened her arms to welcome her friend and brought her into a tight embrace.  
'当然，第一个来迎接我的会是光，' 她心想。"你好，光！" 她张开双臂迎接朋友，紧紧地拥抱了她。

"I'm glad you are okay!" Hikari said, "It's been so long since the last time I saw you! I was worried sick! It was Ikari-Kun who told me you're okay that settled me down a little!"  
"我很高兴你没事！" 光说，"自从上次见面已经过去很久了！我担心得要命！是真嗣告诉我你没事，我才稍微安心了些！"

"No need to worry, Hikari! I'm the great Asuka Langley Soryu, I can handle everything!" Asuka said proudly, "How have you been? How far have you and the Jock Stooge progressed? Have you gone to first base already?" She teased with a wink.  
“不用担心，光！我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，什么都能搞定！”明日香自豪地说道，“你最近怎么样？你和那个运动白痴进展到哪一步了？已经上了一垒吗？”她眨眼调侃道。

Hikari blushed a little, "Asuka! We are taking things slowly!" She paused a little, looking around, making sure no one was eavesdropping, "we… we only kissed!"  
光微微脸红，“明日香！我们进展得很慢！”她稍稍停顿，环顾四周，确保没人偷听，“我们……我们只是接吻了！”

Just as Asuka and Hikari were doing their casual girls' gossips, Shinji, Kensuke, and Toji were at the other part of the classroom chatting. "Yo, Shin-man! How's your weekend?"  
正当明日香和光在闲聊女生八卦时，真嗣、剑介和班长在教室的另一边聊天。“哟，真嗣！周末过得怎么样？”

"It's fine, I guess, I got to spend more time with Asuka." Shinji said with a small grin.  
"还行吧，至少能多陪陪明日香。" 真嗣带着一丝微笑说道。

"Good for you, man. By the way, what's up with Red recently? She's been missing school for a while." Kensuke asked.  
"不错啊，伙计。对了，最近红怎么了？她已经好一阵子没来学校了。" 健介问道。

"Ah, there was an incident at NERV, and she's not allowed to leave GeoFront," Shinji said. Although he was technically telling the truth, he still hid the majority of the information from them. "And what about your pilot status? Are you and Hikari…"  
"啊，NERV 那边出了点事，她现在不能离开 GeoFront，" 真嗣说。虽然他说的基本上是实话，但他还是对他们隐瞒了大部分信息。"那你现在的驾驶员身份呢？你和光……"

Toji's eyebrow twitched a little, "We are both reserved pilots now, we don't have EVA Units for us, do we?" In fact, Toji was more than happy to be reserved; actually, he'd rather have nothing to do with  
冬二眉头微微一跳，“我们现在都是预备驾驶员了，没有 EVA 给我们驾驶，对吧？”实际上，冬二对成为预备驾驶员感到非常高兴；其实，他宁愿与

EVAs anymore. However, his little sister was still in NERV hospital, recovering. NERV's cutting-edge medical technology had been showing its true colors regarding healing Sakura's wounds, and this single reason was enough for Toji to stay as a reserved pilot.  
EVA 再无瓜葛。然而，他的妹妹仍在 NERV 医院中康复。NERV 尖端的医疗技术在治愈樱的伤口方面展现出了真正的实力，仅此一点就足以让冬二继续作为预备驾驶员留在这里。

Shinji sighed, "So I'll take Sakura's still in the hospital?"  
真嗣叹了口气，“所以樱还在医院里？”

"Yeah, man. I plan to quit NERV as soon as she recovers. With Hikari." Toji said with a sad look on his face.  
“是啊，伙计。我打算等她一康复就离开 NERV。和光一起。” 冬二脸上带着悲伤的表情说道。

"Man, you know, I was obsessed with EVAs before. Now I really don't want to be a pilot anymore, although I'm still interested in technical parts of them." Kensuke said, much to Shinji's surprise.  
“哥们，你知道吗，我以前对 EVA 痴迷得不得了。现在我真的不想再当驾驶员了，尽管我对它们的技术部分还是很感兴趣。” 健介的话让真嗣颇为惊讶。

"Right. I don't want any of you to have anything to do with the EVAs," Shinji said, "every time I'm in an EVA people get hurt. If it's not because I could protect people I care about, I'd already run away."  
“没错。我不希望你们任何人再和 EVA 扯上关系，” 真嗣说，“每次我驾驶 EVA，都会有人受伤。如果不是因为我能保护我在乎的人，我早就逃走了。”

The three stooges fell into a comfortable silence. Sensei came in minutes later and the students promptly went back to their seats. "Rise! Bow! Sit!" Hikari called.  
三个傻瓜陷入了舒适的沉默。几分钟后，老师进来了，学生们立刻回到座位上。“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”光里喊道。

The Sensei kept on talking about Second Impact, which quickly got everyone bored. After hours of torture, the lunch bell finally rang, and everyone in the classroom let out a big cry of joy.  
老师一直在谈论第二次冲击，这很快就让大家都感到无聊。经过几个小时的折磨，午餐铃终于响了，教室里的每个人都发出了一声欢呼。

"Baka-Shinji! Let's go eat!" Asuka said, smiling, slamming her hands onto Shinji's desk.  
“笨蛋真嗣！我们去吃饭吧！”明日香笑着说，双手猛地拍在真嗣的桌子上。

"S-sure thing, Asuka." Shinji took out the Bentos and stood up, his wrist was immediately grabbed by Asuka who started dragging him out of the classroom. He made no resistance whatsoever.  
“好、好的，明日香。” 真嗣拿出便当，站起身来，手腕立刻被明日香抓住，她开始拉着他走出教室。他丝毫没有反抗。

They reached the roof of the building and sat down at their 'usual' spot. "I hope you cooked something good - I mean, I know whatever you cook is good, but I want good German food! Like you promised!"  
他们到达了屋顶，坐在他们的‘老地方’。“我希望你做了些好吃的——我是说，我知道你做的任何东西都好吃，但我想要正宗的德国菜！就像你承诺的那样！”

Shinji smiled, "How could I forget? Open the bento and see what's inside!"  
真嗣微笑道：“我怎么会忘记呢？打开便当看看里面有什么吧！”

Asuka opened the bento, just to find a steak with some bread aside. Looking carefully, she found there was something on the steak; words written by sauce, 'ich Liebe Dich. Asuka immediately blushed and smiled hard, "Hmph. It's not exactly German, but I guess it'll do." 'When does he get so good at dealing with girls?' She thought.  
明日香打开便当，只见一块牛排旁边配着几片面包。仔细一看，牛排上似乎有些东西；是用酱汁写成的字，'ich Liebe Dich.' 明日香的脸颊立刻泛起红晕，努力露出笑容，"哼，虽然不是正宗的德语，但勉强接受吧。" 她心想，"他什么时候变得这么会讨女孩子欢心了？"

Fortunately for Shinji, he could read all what Asuka thought by her expression. "I'm glad you like it, Asuka." He said with a warm smile.  
幸好对真嗣来说，他能从明日香的表情中读出她的所有想法。"我很高兴你喜欢，明日香。" 他带着温暖的微笑说道。

The pilots ate their lunches in a comfortable silence. Asuka finished first since she was practically devouring the meal like a wolf.  
驾驶员们在舒适的沉默中享用午餐。明日香最先吃完，因为她几乎是狼吞虎咽地吃着这顿饭。

Unfortunately, her actions had a little side-effect - now she had to go to the bathroom. "Shinji, I think I ate too fast and now my stomach aches! Scheisse! I need to go to the bathroom!" She swiftly got up from the ground and started running towards the exit. "And by the way, the food was really good!" She yelled to Shinji just before she disappeared into the building.  
不幸的是，她的行为带来了一个小小的副作用——现在她不得不去洗手间。“真嗣，我觉得我吃得太快了，现在肚子疼！该死！我得去洗手间！”她迅速从地上站起来，开始向出口跑去。“顺便说一句，食物真的很好吃！”她在大楼里消失前对真嗣喊道。

Shinji could only sigh in response.  
真嗣只能叹气回应。

Twenty minutes later Asuka finally came out of the bathroom. As she was walking towards her classroom, she was suddenly surrounded by a group of upperclass students. 'Great, first day at school, see what I get into.'  
二十分钟后，明日香终于从洗手间出来了。当她走向教室时，突然被一群高年级学生围住了。‘太好了，开学第一天，看看我遇到了什么。’

"Look this is the freak clone," one of the students said, "Hey we don't welcome clones here! Get back to your lab tubes!"  
"看，这就是那个怪胎克隆人，"一个学生说，"嘿，我们这里不欢迎克隆人！滚回你的实验室试管去！"

"You leave now, or we'll force you to leave!" Another student threatened, swinging his fist.  
"你现在就走，不然我们就强行让你走！"另一个学生威胁道，挥舞着拳头。"

Asuka sighed, "listen you dorks, I have no time dealing with stuck-up kids! Fuck off my face right now, or I'll make you hope you were the Angel I dissected last month!"  
明日香叹了口气，"听着，你们这些呆子，我没时间应付自以为是的孩子们！现在就从我面前滚开，否则我会让你们希望自己是上个月我解剖的那个使徒！"

The group of seniors exchanged puzzling looks, then suddenly burst out laughing. "Hahaha, very funny, you freak. What are you without your robot?"  
一群高年级学生交换着困惑的眼神，随即突然爆发出笑声。“哈哈哈，真搞笑，你这个怪胎。没了你的机器人，你算什么？”

Asuka groaned in irritation. She assessed the situation and decided the best course of action now would be to beat the dog before the lion; one-shotting the bulkiest one among them would certainly deliver the message. Just as she was about to lash out, she suddenly felt a familiar vibration inside her pocket. 'Damn, don't tell me it's an Angel attack.' She took out her phone and confirmed her suspicion. Without a word, she started running towards the stairs.  
明日香烦躁地咕哝了一声。她评估了形势，决定现在最好的行动方案是先打狗后打狮；一击干掉他们中最壮的那个肯定能传达信息。正当她准备出手时，突然感觉到口袋里熟悉的震动。“该死，不会是使徒来袭吧。”她拿出手机确认了自己的猜想。二话不说，她开始朝楼梯跑去。

Two of the upperclassmen tried to block her way but were sent flying. "Fuck off my way!" She yelled without looking back.  
两个高年级学生试图挡住她的去路，却被击飞了。“给我滚开！”她头也不回地喊道。

Misato looked up at the monitor of the Command Center, staring at the strange creature hovering over the open fields of Tokyo-3. To call it a creature felt wrong, as unlike any of the previous Angels, it showed no forms of anatomy similar to that of the creatures of Earth. It had no arms, legs, eyes, or even a face to speak of. The Angel could only be described as a glowing halo formed by a double helix.  
美里抬头看着指挥中心的监视器，盯着那只悬浮在东京-3 开阔田野上的奇怪生物。称之为生物似乎不妥，因为它与之前的使徒不同，没有显示出任何与地球生物相似的解剖结构。它没有手臂、腿、眼睛，甚至没有脸。这个使徒只能被描述为一个由双螺旋构成的发光光环。

"I've never seen anything like it before." Major Katsuragi let out, staring in awe at the being.  
"我以前从未见过这样的东西。"葛城美里少校惊叹道，目不转睛地盯着那个存在。

"Neither have the MAGI, apparently." Ritsuko replied, looking over Maya's shoulder and glancing over the readings on her monitor. "It keeps cycling between orange and blue, which means that the MAGI can't properly identify it due to constant shifts in its molecular structure."  
"显然，MAGI 系统也没有见过。"律子回答，目光越过玛雅的肩膀，扫视着她屏幕上的读数。"它不断在橙色和蓝色之间循环，这意味着 MAGI 无法准确识别它，因为它的分子结构在不断变化。"

"So basically it doesn't have one specific form?" Misato asked, seeking clarification as she approached the microphone.  
"所以基本上它没有固定的形态？"美里问道，一边靠近麦克风寻求澄清。

"In laymen terms, yes." Ritsuko said.  
"用外行人的话说，是的。" 律子说道。

"Alright." Misato sighed before speaking into the microphone. "Are the pilots of Unit D and Unit 02 prepped and ready?"  
"好吧。" 美里叹了口气，然后对着麦克风说。"D 号机和 02 号机的驾驶员准备好了吗？"

"The pilots had just finished changing and heading toward the EVA  
"驾驶员们刚刚换好衣服，正朝 EVA 走去"

cages." Aoba reported. "笼子。" 青叶报告道。

"How about Unit 00? What's Rei gonna do?" Maya asked.  
"“那零号机呢？绫波要怎么办？” 真希波问道。

"She'll be put on standby for now, we don't know how much lasting damage from the last Angel had on her. Just put Unit 00 on the catapult."  
“她暂时待命，我们还不清楚上次使徒对她造成了多少持久伤害。先把零号机放到弹射器上。”

"Hai." Maya said. "嗨。" 真希说。

Shinji and Asuka got into their respective EVAs and prepared for launch. They were very nervous since this Angel was the hardest one to deal with; in both of their timelines, it took Ayanami to self- destruct to kill the Angel. Now Ayanami was put on standby, leaving Shinji and Asuka to face the Angel themselves. Did this mean one of the needed to self-destruct as well?  
真嗣和明日香各自进入他们的 EVA，准备发射。他们非常紧张，因为这个使徒是最难对付的；在他们的两个时间线中，都是靠绫波自我毁灭来杀死使徒。现在绫波被安排待命，留下真嗣和明日香独自面对使徒。这是否意味着他们中的一个也需要自我毁灭呢？

Asuka shook the thoughts out of her head. Now it's not the time to think about something like that. "Misato, I'm ready!"  
明日香摇摇头，甩开这些念头。现在不是想这些的时候。"美里，我准备好了！"

"I'm ready as well!" Shinji's voice came into the channel.  
"我也准备好了！" 真嗣的声音在通讯频道中响起。

"Right. EVAs launch!" Misato ordered. After Unit D and Unit 02 went up to the surface, she then said, "Unit D will use the sniper rifle, and Unit 02 will engage in close-quarters combat with prog axe.  
"好。EVA 机体，出击！" 美里命令道。在 D 型机和 02 号机升至地面后，她接着说："D 型机使用狙击步枪，02 号机则用战术斧进行近战。

Understood?" 明白了吗？

"Roger." Both pilots said.  
"罗杰。" 两位驾驶员同时说道。

On the battlefield, Unit D already remained in position, totting its sniper rifle in hand. Crouching down behind a series of trees, Shinji looked on at the Angel as it spiraled around in its fixed position. If he had to make a rough estimate, it was about three hundred meters in circumference, but only five or so meters thick. He scanned up and down it for its core, but was unable to find it, just like the last time. If  
战场上，D 小队已经就位，手持狙击步枪。躲在一排树后，真嗣注视着天使在其固定位置上盘旋。如果他粗略估计，它的直径大约有三百米，但厚度仅约五米。他上下搜索着它的核心，却未能找到，就像上次一样。如果

it even had a distinguishable core for that matter.  
它甚至有一个可辨认的核心的话。

"Shinji," Misato's voice came through, filling the cockpit. "just hold back and let us study it for a bit. We don't have a good idea on how to approach it yet." Almost as soon as the words came through, the spiraling double helix slowly ceased its spiraling, coming to a complete stop. "No." The brown-haired pilot spoke, his colbalt eyes narrowing on the Angel. "It's coming!"  
“真嗣，”美里通过通讯传来声音，充满了驾驶舱。“先别动，让我们研究一下。我们还不清楚如何应对它。”话音刚落，那螺旋状的双螺旋结构缓缓停止了旋转，完全静止下来。“不。”棕发驾驶员说道，他那钴蓝色的眼睛紧盯着天使。“它来了！”

Within a matter of seconds, the double helix that made up the Angel started to morph together, bonding it into one single form. Then with a shriek, the halo split in two, morphing it into a long, thread-like shape. With blinding speed, one of its ends shot forward as its tip formed into a fine point, lunging at Unit D like a spear. "Shinji, get out of the way!" Misato's cry was in vain, as even the impressive speed of an Evangelion couldn't outmatch the Angel's. Shinji raised his AT- Field, but the powerful force field did nothing to hold back the Angel, as the thread pierced into the narrow abdomen of the blue Unit D, only being stopped from penetrating further by the EVA's free hand, which is used to hold back the Angel. Shinji could feel a searing pain in his lower stomach as warped tendrils began to crawl through both the EVA and his plugsuit. "Arghhhh! It hurts!" He cried out in pain.  
转瞬间，构成使徒的双螺旋开始融合，凝聚成单一形态。随即一声尖啸，光环一分为二，变形为细长的线状。以迅雷不及掩耳之势，其一端尖锐如矛，直刺向 D 型机。“真嗣，快躲开！”美里喊道，但她的呼喊徒劳无功，即便是福音战士的速度也无法匹敌使徒。真嗣启动了 AT 力场，然而这强大的力场在使徒面前毫无作用，细线刺入了蓝色 D 型机的腹部，仅被 EVA 的另一只手所阻，那只手正竭力遏制使徒的攻势。真嗣感到下腹剧痛，扭曲的触须开始在 EVA 和他驾驶服内蔓延。“啊！好痛！”他痛苦地喊出声来。

Over the communication channel, he could hear the Command Center speak of contamination spreading throughout the EVA, as well as bio-fusion with the Angel. In a desperation attack, Unit D rose its sniper rifle with its freehand and unloaded its clip into the strand of thread it was grasping onto. Each bullet ripped through the Angel, but the wounds were instantly sealed by the strange biomaterial that made up the creature's anatomy.  
通过通讯频道，他听到指挥中心报告污染正在 EVA 中蔓延，以及与使徒的生物融合。在绝望的攻击中，D 型机用空着的手举起狙击步枪，将弹匣中的子弹全部射入它所抓住的那根丝线。每一颗子弹都穿透了使徒，但伤口瞬间被构成使徒身体的奇异生物材料封闭。

"Asuka, assist Unit D!" Misato yelled into the comm channel. On the screen, the percentage of bio-fusion was increasing rapidly.  
“明日香，支援 D 型机！”美里对着通讯频道大喊。屏幕上，生物融合的百分比正在迅速上升。

Above the command deck, Gendo Ikari folded his hands tighter. He was still waiting for the moment.  
在指挥甲板上，碇源堂双手紧握。他仍在等待那一刻。

"Shinji, I'm coming!" Asuka rushed towards Unit D and grabbed the tail of the Angel, she willed her EVA to pull the Angel out of her boyfriend. With a combined effort from Unit D the Angel gave in and  
“真嗣，我来啦！”明日香冲向 D 型机，抓住了使徒的尾巴，她命令 EVA 将使徒从男友身边拉开。在 D 型机的共同努力下，使徒终于屈服了，

its connection with the purple-reddish EVA was severed. Turning around, it targeted Unit 02 as its next prey. With a whirl of motion, the Angel circled around the crimson EVA and entangled itself onto the humanoid. 'Great, now I'm in trouble.' Asuka thought, 'but at least Shinji is safe.'  
它与紫红色 EVA 的联系被切断。转身后，它将目标锁定为 02 型机作为下一个猎物。随着一阵旋转，使徒围绕着深红色 EVA 缠绕上去，将人形机牢牢困住。‘这下麻烦了。’明日香心想，‘但至少真嗣安全了。’

Gendo Ikari smiled. He was waiting for the moment. Reaching down to his pocket, he pulled out a small device and pressed the button.  
碇源堂微微一笑。他一直在等待这一刻。伸手从口袋里掏出一个小装置，按下了按钮。

Inside the entry plug Asuka suddenly felt something.  
在插入栓内，明日香突然感觉到什么。

_DIE WITH ME! 与我同归于尽吧！_

"Huh?" Asuka was confused. Looking at the EVA Unit status panel her went wide as she saw what was happening.  
“啊？” 明日香感到困惑。她看向 EVA 机体状态面板，眼睛瞪得大大的，因为她看到了正在发生的事情。

'MODE D - ACTIVATED'  
'模式 D - 已激活'

"Unit 02's control interface was overwritten!" Maya reported in horror, "OH MY GOD ITS GONNA-"  
“二号机的控制界面被篡改了！”玛雅惊恐地报告，“天哪，它要——”

Before she even finished her sentence, the screen monitoring the battlefield was filled with bright light. Everyone on the command deck, also including Shinji in Unit D, watched in awe as Unit 02 exploded into a ball of fire.  
她话音未落，战场监控屏幕已被强光填满。指挥舱内的所有人，包括驾驶 D 型机的真嗣，都目瞪口呆地看着二号机爆炸成一团火球。

"… self destruct…" Mya finished her sentence, her voice trembling.  
“……自毁……”米娅说完这句话，声音颤抖着。

"Pattern Blue eliminated… target has gone silent," Aoba finally reported, "and Unit 02…"  
“蓝色模式已消除……目标已静默，”青叶终于报告道，“而二号机……”

Ritsuko looked around her, everyone was in disbelief or confusion. However, Misato seemed to be oddly calm. "Send a retrieval team out there." She ordered.  
律子环顾四周，每个人都难以置信或困惑。然而，美里似乎异常平静。“派出回收小组。”她命令道。

Gendo sat in his office alone in satisfaction. His plan worked out perfectly, didn't it? Two birds with one stone. He couldn't help but  
源渡独自坐在办公室里，心中满是得意。他的计划完美无缺，不是吗？一箭双雕。他忍不住

smile widely. 露出了宽慰的笑容。

However, as a person who had so many years of experience in the Anti-reconnaissance, he felt something was still off. To be specific, he felt the atmosphere of his office was filled with a murderous aura. He had never felt something like this before.  
然而，作为一个有着多年反侦察经验的人，他总觉得有些不对劲。具体来说，他感到办公室里弥漫着一股杀气。他以前从未有过这种感觉。

He then heard footsteps walking towards him. Very light, but definitely there. A chill ran down his spine. It couldn't be an assassin, right? His office was literally the safest place on earth, excluding Terminal Dogma. Was it Fuyutsuki? He was still on the command deck below his office. Could it be Section 2 coming in to report? But they would certainly announce their entrance. He turned around slowly; once he saw the intruder, he immediately felt the whole world spinning around him and broke apart. He summoned all his willpower to spit out his final words before falling into the darkness.  
随后，他听到脚步声朝他走来。非常轻，但确实存在。一阵寒意沿着他的脊椎蔓延。不可能是刺客吧？他的办公室可以说是地球上最安全的地方，除了最终教条区。会是冬月吗？他还在指挥甲板下方的办公室里。难道是第二支部来汇报？但他们肯定会先通报一声。他缓缓转过身；一看到入侵者，他立刻感到整个世界在他周围旋转并支离破碎。他用尽所有意志力，在坠入黑暗前吐出了最后的遗言。

"Pilot Soryu." “碇唯。”

Outside on the battlefield, Ritsuko and several technicians were wearing heavy hazmat suits. They found the remains of Unit 02's entry plug, which was no more than a crushed, mangled mess. The laser cutting crew cut open the plug, Ritsuko stepped in, and she was taken aback by what she saw.  
在战场外，赤木律子和几名技术人员身穿厚重的防化服。他们找到了 02 号机插入栓的残骸，那不过是一堆被压得面目全非的废铁。激光切割队切开了插入栓，赤木律子走进去，眼前的景象让她大吃一惊。

She saw nothing. 她什么也没看见。

"The Second Child's condition will be classified Top Secret," Ritsuko ordered, "Sergeant, salvage the entry plug and clean the site."  
“二号机驾驶员的状况将被列为最高机密，”律子命令道，“中士，回收插入栓并清理现场。”

Inside Unit D Shinji could feel a sudden burst of Asuka's AT-Field. Of course, he knew she would be okay; he was more worried about whether she could continue to hide her true identity after this incident. He waited in the entry plug for the retrieval team to pick him up.  
在 D 型机体内部，真嗣突然感受到了明日香 AT 力场的爆发。当然，他知道她会没事的；他更担心的是，经过这次事件后，她是否还能继续隐藏自己的真实身份。他在插入栓中等待回收小组的到来。

On the command deck, everyone except Misato was still shocked. "Pilot Ikari retrieved successfully, condition normal," Makoto finally reported, "we are not getting anything from recovery team for Unit 02."  
在指挥甲板上，除了美里，所有人都还处于震惊之中。“碇真嗣驾驶员已成功回收，状况正常，”真希波终于报告道，“我们没有收到二号机回收小组的任何消息。”

Misato sighed. She knew Asuka would be okay, or the retrieval team would have reported something already. The only explanation for them not reporting anything would be they saw something abnormal, and the information was classified. "How did it self-destruct on itself?"  
美里叹了口气。她知道明日香会没事的，否则回收小组早就报告了。他们没有报告任何事情的唯一解释是他们看到了异常情况，而信息被归类为机密。“它是怎么自毁的？”

"I… I don't know," Maya said, "something sent a signal to Unit 02 and overridden the controls. Then it was set to MODE D by the signal. Things happened so fast that there was no time to even eject the entry plug."  
“我……我不知道，”玛雅说，“有什么东西向二号机发送了信号并接管了控制权。然后信号将其设置为 D 模式。事情发生得太快，连弹出插入栓的时间都没有。”

Misato swallowed. She knew this could be some trick played by someone who wanted Asuka dead. Presumably Ritsuko. Or the Commander. She shook her head and changed the subject, "Status of Unit 00?"  
美里咽了咽口水。她知道这可能是某个想让明日香死的人玩的把戏。大概是律子。或者是司令。她摇了摇头，改变了话题，“零号机的状态如何？”

"Moving back to EVA cages," Aoba said, "Pilot Ayanami in excellent condition."  
“返回 EVA 格纳库，”青叶说，“驾驶员绫波状态良好。”

"Get pilots to the debriefing room," Misato ordered. "Hai." Maya said, "Should I inform Commander Ikari?" "Get Section 2 to report to him."  
“让驾驶员们到简报室来，”美里命令道。“是。”玛雅说，“需要通知碇司令吗？”“让第二课向他汇报。”

"Hai." Maya picked up the phone, "Agent Hanzo, report to Commander Ikari."  
"嗨。" 真希拿起电话，"韩索特工，向碇司令报告。"

"Roger." The agent said to the microphone in his earbuds. Several seconds later, the agent's panicked voice came into the phone, "Report! We have an emergency! Commander Ikari is missing!"  
"收到。" 特工对着耳塞麦克风说道。几秒钟后，特工惊慌的声音通过电话传来，"报告！我们有紧急情况！碇司令失踪了！"

"What?" Maya asked, "What do you mean by 'missing?'"  
"什么？" 真希问道，"你说的'失踪'是什么意思？"

"The commander is not in the office!"  
“指挥官不在办公室！”

"Check the surveillance cameras! We need to know where he went!" Misato ordered, "Use the MAGI to track him down!"  
“检查监控摄像头！我们需要知道他去了哪里！”美里命令道，“使用 MAGI 追踪他！”

"The camera inside the office had been fried moments ago! However, in the last image, the Commander was still there!" Makoto said.  
“办公室内的摄像头刚刚被烧毁了！但在最后一张图像中，指挥官还在那里！”真琴说。

'Not good…' Misato thought, her fists clenching, "announce first level alert! Mobilize all police forces and Section 2! We need to find him!" Misato wasn't really cared about the Commander's personal welfare; in fact, she would be glad to see him die. However, she was more afraid that the Commander had some secret plans.  
"“不妙啊……” 美里想着，拳头紧握，“宣布一级警戒！调动所有警力和第二分部！我们必须找到他！” 美里其实并不真正关心司令的个人安危；事实上，她很乐意见到他死去。然而，她更担心司令有什么秘密计划。”

SEELE 01: "Ikari's missing, presumably abducted. The deviation in our scenario is becoming irreversible. We need to take action."  
SEELE 01: “碇失踪了，推测是被绑架。我们的计划偏差正在变得不可逆转。我们需要采取行动。”

SEELE 03: "Do you plan to send Tabris there right now?"  
SEELE 03: “你打算现在就派塔布里斯过去吗？”

SEELE 01: "That is correct. Tabris is already in Tokyo-3. We need to speed up the process. The final judgment day will come soon."  
SEELE 01: \"那是正确的。塔布里斯已经抵达东京-3。我们需要加快进程。最终审判之日即将到来。\"

SEELE 05: "Without Unit 02 our plan could certainly to carried out more smoothly. Tabris will be likely to hijack Unit 00. With two EVAs down, nothing could stop the ultimate evolution of humanity."  
SEELE 05: \"没有二号机，我们的计划无疑会执行得更加顺利。塔布里斯很可能会劫持零号机。两台 EVA 失效后，人类的终极进化将无人能挡。\"

Shinji came back to the apartment with Misato, looking dejected. He didn't know how long he had to wait to be with Asuka again. So he was greatly surprised to see his favorite redhead already waiting for them in the living room.  
真嗣和美里回到公寓，神情沮丧。他不知道还要等多久才能再次见到明日香。因此，当他看到他最喜欢的红发女孩已经在客厅等着他们时，感到非常惊讶。

"Asuka!" Shinji said happily.  
"明日香！" 真嗣开心地说道。

"Hey Baka," Asuka greeted, "I guess I can stay here, right? As long as I don't go outside."  
"嘿，笨蛋，" 明日香打招呼道，"我想我可以留在这里，对吧？只要我不出去。"

"R-right," Shinji replied, "but when do we plan to tell NERV?"  
"嗯，对，" 真嗣回答，"但我们打算什么时候告诉 NERV 呢？"

"Shinji, your father is missing right now. So that means Fuyutsuki is in charge of everything. Maybe we can manage to reveal part of Asuka's identity, just enough for her to go outside without triggering alarms." Misato said, a grin appearing on her face, "And I guess you're the one who took care of the Commander, right Asuka?"  
"真嗣，你父亲现在失踪了。所以这意味着冬月负责一切。也许我们可以设法揭露一部分明日香的身份，刚好让她能出去而不触发警报。" 美里说道，脸上露出了笑容，"我猜是你处理了司令，对吧，明日香？"

"Hmph. He tried to kill me, what should I do? Beg for mercy? Of course I'd fight back!" Asuka snorted, "Don't worry I didn't kill him. I simply put him somewhere safe but impossible to get out. It's just well-justified self-defense. Maybe after this whole mess I could get him back, if Shinji would want that of course."  
"哼。他想杀我，我该怎么办？求饶吗？当然我要反击！" 明日香哼了一声，"别担心，我没杀他。我只是把他放在了一个安全但无法逃脱的地方。这只是正当防卫。也许这一切结束后，我可以把他带回来，当然，如果真嗣希望的话。"

Misato almost smiled, "but how do you know it was him?"  
美里几乎要笑了，"但你怎知是他？"

Asuka scoffed, "It was my sixth sense. I just had a feeling that the Commander would do something like this. I just went to his office and saw the detonator on his table. What an Arschloch." She then looked at Shinji, "your father's really a fucking piece of shit!"  
明日香嗤之以鼻，“这是我的第六感。我只是有种预感，指挥官会做出这种事。我刚去他办公室，就看到他桌上的引爆器。真是个混蛋。”她随后看向真嗣，“你爸真是个该死的混蛋！”

Shinji sighed, "Asuka, I don't see him as father anymore. Not after  
真嗣叹了口气，“明日香，我不再把他当父亲了。尤其是自从”

what he tried to do to you. And I have my family right here and now; what more can I ask for?"  
他试图对你做的事之后。我现在有我的家人在这里，还能要求什么呢？”

Both Asuka and Misato smiled at his words. "Anyways, now you should make me dinner!"  
明日香和美里听到他的话都笑了。“总之，现在你该给我做晚饭了！”

"Sure thing, Asuka." “当然，明日香。”

The day passed, and Shinji had to go to school again. He was becoming more and more nervous since he knew who the last Angel was. In his timeline, he was obsessed with Asuka, and he simply had a friendship with Kaworu, but it didn't make it easier when he had to kill him. So this time he decided to confront the Nephilim; he wanted to know what's his intention in befriending him, just to ask him to kill  
日子一天天过去，真嗣不得不再次去上学。他越来越紧张，因为他知道最后一个使徒是谁。在他的时间线里，他痴迷于明日香，与渚薰只是朋友关系，但这并没有让他杀死渚薰变得更容易。所以这次他决定面对那位堕天使；他想知道渚薰与他交朋友的意图，只是为了问他是否愿意杀掉他。

him. Shinji felt betrayed.  
他。真嗣感到被背叛了。

The next day at school, Shinji just felt incredibly anxious; when Toji and Kensuke asked him about the Angel attack yesterday, and Hikari asked him about Asuka, he simply brushed them off with "She's okay but had to stay in GeoFront." He didn't want to be impolite; he just couldn't get off the feeling of something's gonna happen.  
第二天在学校，真嗣感到异常焦虑；当东治和健介问他昨天使徒袭击的情况，光问他关于明日香的事时，他只是简单地搪塞说：“她没事，但得留在 GeoFront。”他不想失礼；只是无法摆脱即将发生什么的感觉。

The bell rang and Sensei came in. "Eh, before we begin class today, um," Nebukawa sensei began, "We have a new transfer student joining us today… please introduce yourself to class."  
铃声响起，老师走了进来。“呃，在我们开始上课之前，嗯，”猫川老师开口道，“今天我们有一位新转学生加入……请向大家自我介绍一下。”

Shinji blinked. He had kinda expected something like this would happen, but he wasn't prepared for it to happen so early. Light footsteps took the newcomer to the chalkboard; his nimble hands quickly drew a few elegant kanji on the board. He turned to face the class with a gentle smile.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他隐约预料到会发生这样的事，但没想到会这么早。轻盈的脚步声引领着新来者走向黑板；他灵巧的手迅速在黑板上勾勒出几个优雅的汉字。他转过身，面带温和的微笑面对全班。

Silver hair. Red eyes. Pale skin. It is him.  
银发。红眸。苍白的肌肤。就是他。

"Hello, everyone. My name is Kaworu Nagisa. I am happy to be here today," His red eyes scanned the classroom, finally settling down on Shinji. Shinji saw clearly Kaworu's eyes twitched, his ever-presenting grin almost changed into confusion for a moment. But he quickly adjusted his composure and continued, "Very happy."  
“大家好，我叫渚薰。很高兴今天能来到这里，”他的红眸扫视着教室，最终落在真嗣身上。真嗣清楚地看到，薰的眼角微微抽动，那始终挂着的微笑几乎转瞬即逝地变成了困惑。但他很快调整了情绪，继续说道，“非常高兴。”

Disclaimer: I do not own Evangelion. Chapter 15: The Final Messenger  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。第 15 章：最后的使者

One feeling that Kaworu had rarely had was confusion. Now he was experiencing it. He simply couldn't understand what was happening; how come Shinji Ikari possessed such a strong AT-Field? It had never happened before in any other lives his counterparts lived. He didn't have his counterparts' memories, but he could feel a general trend from all of them. Sometimes Shinji was desperate for love and friendship, other times he had the Second Child with him, and sometimes he had Rei with him. In some of his lives, Kaworu even tried to give love to the desperate Second Child, well those attempts failed miserably. It seemed his way of approaching people couldn't work with the fiery redhead. But this thing was new, or at least it had happened so few times that he couldn't pick it up among all the fuzzy memories.  
卡罗尔很少感到困惑，但现在他正经历着这种感觉。他完全无法理解发生了什么；为什么碇真嗣会拥有如此强大的 AT 力场？这在其他任何一次他的同位体生活中都从未发生过。他没有同位体的记忆，但他能从他们所有人中感受到一种普遍的趋势。有时真嗣渴望爱和友谊，有时他和明日香在一起，有时他和绫波零在一起。在一些生活中，卡罗尔甚至试图给予绝望的第二适格者爱，但那些尝试都惨败收场。看来他对付那个火爆的红发女孩的方法行不通。但这件事是新的，或者至少它发生的次数太少，以至于他无法在所有模糊的记忆中识别出来。

Suddenly Kaworu didn't know how to approach Shinji anymore. At least he was sure that Shinji wasn't an Angel; that was even if he comes to contact with Adam, Third Impact wouldn't happen. Every time he would assess the situation and decide whether he should give him love or just friendship, depending on Shinji's relationship with Rei and Asuka. In this timeline from what he knew from SEELE's reports Shinji and Asuka was in love - although he didn't see her in class, which made him curious -, so his original plan was to simply befriend him. Now though he wasn't even sure whether he  
突然间，渚薰不知道该如何接近真嗣了。至少他确信真嗣不是使徒；即便他与亚当接触，第三次冲击也不会发生。每次他都会评估情况，决定是给予他爱还是仅仅保持友谊，这取决于真嗣与绫波和明日香的关系。根据他从 Seele 的报告中了解到的，在这个时间线上真嗣和明日香相爱了——尽管他没在班上看到她，这让他感到好奇——，所以他原本的计划是简单地与他交朋友。但现在，他甚至不确定是否

should even come close to him.  
应该接近他。

Walking closer toward an empty seat two rows beside Shinji's seat, Kaworu smiled and nodded to the class. Most of the girls were immediately attracted by his exotic features, and the males were getting jealous. Sitting down on his seat, he opened his laptop and immediately got a flood of new messages.  
走向真嗣座位旁两排的一个空座位，渚薰微笑着向全班点头致意。大多数女生立刻被他异国情调的特征所吸引，而男生们则开始嫉妒。坐到座位上，他打开笔记本电脑，立刻收到了一大堆新消息。

Kaworu shook his head and discarded the messages. However, he noticed something when doing so; Shinji had sent him a message. Curious, he clicked on the message.  
渚薰摇了摇头，将那些信息丢弃。然而，在这样做的时候，他注意到了一些东西；真嗣给他发了一条信息。出于好奇，他点击了那条信息。

_Nagisa-san, could you meet me on the roof during lunch? I'd like to show you around.  
渚君，午饭时能在屋顶见个面吗？我想带你四处看看。_

_Shinji I._

Kaworu smiled a little; at least Shinji seemed friendly enough to him. Maybe things weren't so bad after all. He typed his reply to Shinji.  
渚薰微微一笑；至少真嗣对他似乎足够友好。也许事情并没有那么糟糕。他给真嗣回复了信息。

_I'm glad to. And call me K aworu, Shinji-kun.  
我很高兴。叫我渚薰吧，真嗣君。_

Although he saw Shinji flashed him a warm smile, Kaworu could still sense Shinji's nervousness by the slight vibration of his AT-Field.  
尽管他看到真嗣向他露出了温暖的微笑，渚薰仍能通过他 AT 力场轻微的震动感受到真嗣的紧张。

Shaking his thoughts off, Kaworu started paying attention to the teacher. He was still interested in Lilin culture, especially how they would cope with such a catastrophic event.  
渚薰摇了摇头，抛开这些思绪，开始关注起老师来。他对人类文化仍然很感兴趣，尤其是他们将如何应对如此灾难性的事件。

Time came and passed, and the lunch bell rang. Shinji had been keeping stealing glances in his direction; Kaworu wasn't sure if it was a good sign or not. He had already lost his confidence in reading Shinji's thoughts.  
时间流逝，午餐铃声响起。真嗣不时偷偷瞥向他这边；渚薰不确定这是否是个好兆头。他已经失去了读懂真嗣心思的信心。

Kaworu came to the roof and waited for Shinji's appearance. Moments later, the brown-haired pilot emerged from the exit, humming Ode to Joy.  
渚薰来到屋顶，等待着真嗣的出现。片刻后，棕色头发的驾驶员从出口走出，哼着《欢乐颂》。

"Ode to Joy," Kaworu said, turning his head to Shinji, "That is the song you are singing, is it not?"  
“《欢乐颂》，”渚薰转向真嗣说道，“你唱的就是这首歌，对吧？”

"Oh! Hi, Kaworu-kun!" Shinji quickly glanced to the last Angel, "Yeah. Am I singing too loud? I'm sorry if I bothered you."  
“哦！嗨，薰君！” 真嗣迅速瞥了一眼最后一个使徒，“是啊。我唱得太响了吗？如果打扰到你了，我很抱歉。”

The silver-haired boy rolled his eyes, waving his hand in a dismissive gesture. "Don't apologize. I thought it was beautiful." He lowered his hand and placed it in his pocket, keeping his eyes on Shinji. "They say that music is the pinnacle of Lil-mankind's greatest achievements. Wouldn't you agree?"  
银发少年翻了个白眼，挥手示意无所谓。“不用道歉。我觉得很美。”他放下手，插进口袋，目光始终停留在真嗣身上。“他们说音乐是人类最伟大的成就之一。你不这么认为吗？”

Shinji cocked his head slightly at the question and the slip tongue of the word 'Lilin'. Though he did fancy a wide variety of music from classical to bubble-gummy pop, he had never really thought about it being something so divine in the way that this strange boy was describing it. Of course he had already heard the same exact line in his timeline. "Right, I think music is beautiful, too. It used to give me a gate to escape reality, but now I simply enjoy them."  
真嗣对这个问题的措辞和“李林”一词的滑舌略感疑惑。虽然他确实喜欢从古典到流行等各种音乐，但他从未想过音乐在眼前这个奇怪男孩的描述中会如此神圣。当然，他在自己的时间线里也听过同样的话。“没错，我也觉得音乐很美。它曾是我逃避现实的门扉，但现在我只是单纯地享受它们。”

Kaworu smiled knowingly, "I take you have found your happiness, Shinji-kun."  
渚薰会心地微笑道：“看来你已经找到了你的幸福，真嗣君。”

Shinji blushed a little, "Y-yeah, I found my happiness in the people around me, especially Asuka."  
真嗣微微脸红，“嗯，我在我周围的人身上找到了幸福，尤其是明日香。”

"Asuka? Is she the Second Child, pilot of Evangelion Unit 02?"  
“明日香？她是第二适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员吗？”

"Yes, and she's my, errr, gir-girlfriend," for some reason Shinji was still a little bit shy saying such things.  
"是的，而且她是我的，呃，女朋友，"不知为何，真嗣在说这些话时还是有点害羞。

"I am glad you have found your love, Shinji-kun. Everyone deserves to be loved." Kaworu said, his ever-presenting grin grew wider. Well his purpose, aside from uniting with Adam, was to give Shinji happiness. For what reasons unknown, maybe it was because he found his heart pure, or maybe it was the kindness of a God towards a human. If Shinji had already found what he needed, there's only one purpose left.  
"我很高兴你找到了你的爱，真嗣君。每个人都值得被爱。"渚薰说道，他那始终挂着的微笑变得更加灿烂。除了与亚当合一之外，他的目的就是给真嗣带来幸福。出于某种未知的原因，也许是因为他发现真嗣的心灵纯净，或者是因为神对人的善意。如果真嗣已经找到了他所需要的，那么只剩下一个目的了。

Kaworu turned around and ready to leave. Although he had made up his mind, it could wait. He was still curious about the First and  
渚薰转过身准备离开。尽管他已经下定了决心，但这可以稍后再说。他仍然对第一适格者感到好奇，

Second Child. "It's my time to leave, Shinji-kun. Nice to meet you."  
第二适格者。“是我该离开的时候了，真嗣君。很高兴见到你。”

Shinji didn't want him to go yet. His intention of meeting Kaworu on the roof wasn't simply to have a friendly talk. He had so many questions he wanted to ask. He wanted to know why Kaworu chose to befriend him and just to betray him. He wanted to know why he had to submit to the Call from Adam. He wanted to confront him.  
真嗣还不想让他走。他之所以在屋顶上与渚薰见面，并不仅仅是为了进行一次友好的交谈。他有许多问题想要问。他想知道渚薰为何选择与他交朋友又背叛他。他想知道为什么他必须屈服于亚当的召唤。他想当面质问他。

Most importantly, he wanted to know more about the Angels, their powers and limits, since he was close enough to them. Shinji even had a feeling that Kaworu had already known his Angelic powers since he could also sense his AT-Field. He thought it was logical that the sensation was reciprocated. "W-wait, Kaworu! I-emm, we can have lunch together if you'd want."  
最重要的是，他想更多地了解使徒，他们的力量和极限，因为他与他们足够接近。真嗣甚至有种感觉，渚薰早已知晓他的使徒之力，因为他也能感知到他的 AT 力场。他认为这种感觉是相互的。“等——等等，渚薰！我——呃，如果你愿意的话，我们可以一起吃午饭。”

Kaworu was surprised at his insistence, not that he minded. "Why not, Shinji-kun." They sat down side by side in front of the railing while Shinji took out two Bentos and handed one to Kaworu, who gladly accepted.  
渚薰对他的坚持感到惊讶，不过他并不介意。“为什么不呢，真嗣君。”他们并肩坐在栏杆前，真嗣拿出两个便当，递给渚薰一个，后者欣然接受。

"So… Kaworu, you're the Fif-Sixth Child, right?" Shinji asked, almost slip tongued, but unnoticed by the otherwise perceptive Angel.  
“那么……渚薰，你是第六适格者，对吧？”真嗣问道，差点咬到舌头，但这位敏锐的天使并未察觉。

"They told you, have they not?" Kaworu said, taking a mouthful of food. He paused for a few seconds to swallow the content and continued, "I am indeed the Sixth Child."  
“他们告诉你了，不是吗？”渚薰说着，吃了一口食物。他停顿了几秒钟咽下食物，然后继续说道，“我的确是第六适格者。”

"Well, that's great!" Shinji tried to smile, but he was so nervous that his attempt ended up being an awkward grin, "but… we don't have a spare Unit for you."  
"嗯，那太好了！" 真嗣试图微笑，但他太紧张了，结果变成了一个尴尬的咧嘴笑，"但是……我们没有多余的 EVA 机体给你。"

"I am on the reserved pilots list, not unlike the Fourth and Fifth Children." Kaworu said, "however, I do believe NERV Berlin has completed some of the Mass Production Evangelions, which I shall pilot if it comes to that."  
"我和第四、第五适格者一样，在备用驾驶员名单上。" 渚薰说，"不过，我相信柏林 NERV 已经完成了一些量产型 EVA，如果需要的话，我会驾驶它们。"

Shinji blinked; he took a sharp breath and suddenly felt nauseous hearing the name; his memory of Asuka's Unit 02 being torn to  
真嗣眨了眨眼；他深吸了一口气，突然感到恶心，听到那个名字让他想起了明日香二号机的惨状；

pieces by the white vulture-like EVAs resurfacing. Not as bad as PTSD since he had Asuka now, but it still stung a lot. "M-MP EVAs? They are completed?" Of course he knew they were completed, but his brain that time couldn't really come up with any other response.  
"那些如同白秃鹫般的 EVA 碎片再次浮现。虽然没有 PTSD 那么严重，因为他现在有明日香了，但依然刺痛不已。“M-MP 型 EVA？它们完成了吗？”他当然知道它们已经完成了，但那时他的大脑实在想不出其他回应。”

Kaworu noticed that sudden change in Shinji's composure and violent shift of his AT-Field. He wasn't sure why Shinji had acted this way when hearing about the MP EVAs; he wasn't even supposed to know them yet. But what he knew was that Shinji wasn't feeling well with the topic, so instead of pressing on the problem he decided to change the subject. "Correct. But let's not talk about it right now." Kaworu trailed off, waiting for Shinji to calm down a little, "I wonder what is your plan after the Angel wars?"  
"渚薰注意到真嗣神情的突然变化和他 AT 力场的剧烈波动。他不明白为什么真嗣听到 MP 型 EVA 时会有这样的反应；他甚至还不应该知道它们。但他知道真嗣对这个话题感到不适，所以他没有继续追问，而是决定换个话题。“没错。但我们现在先不谈这个。”渚薰停顿了一下，等待真嗣稍微平静下来，“我想知道，天使战争之后你有什么打算？””

Shinji took a deep breath, effectively coming out of his bad memories. Shaking his head, he said, "I don't know. Maybe I'll just live my life somewhere with Asuka."  
"真嗣深吸了一口气，有效地从糟糕的回忆中抽离出来。他摇了摇头说：“我不知道。也许我会和明日香一起在某处生活。””

"I see. That is such a cliché  answer." Kaworu giggled, "Really? That's all you want? Just to be with the one you love? No big or aspiring desires? No fantasies you'd like to see fulfilled? None of that?" While Kaworu continued laughing, The Third Child frowned, looking back down at his lap. "No, not really."  
"我明白了。这真是个陈词滥调的回答。" 渚薰轻笑道，"真的吗？这就是你想要的全部？只是和所爱的人在一起？没有宏大或远大的愿望？没有想要实现的幻想？这些都没有吗？" 渚薰继续笑着，第三适格者皱起眉头，再次低头看向自己的膝盖。"不，真的没有。"

Once the words escaped his mouth, Kaworu ceased his chuckling and stared at Shinji with fixated crimson eyes. "I mean, before I came here, before I became an EVA pilot, I really didn't have anything. I didn't have any real friends or anybody that I really cared about. But now that I do have those things, I'm starting to realize that was the only thing that I was really missing. I don't really care what I end up doing after all this is done. I'll just be happy to be with my loved ones." His frown started to morph into a smile as he rose his head back up. "What are your dreams, Kawor-" Shinji stopped himself after laying his eyes upon the silver-haired teen. Kaworu's crimson eyes shimmered under the lights hanging above them. His mouth was just slightly agape. "Kaworu, are you okay?"  
话音刚落，渚薰停止了轻笑，用那双深红色的眼睛紧盯着真嗣。"我的意思是，在我来到这里之前，在我成为 EVA 驾驶员之前，我真的什么都没有。我没有真正的朋友，也没有我真正关心的人。但现在我有了这些，我开始意识到那是我唯一真正缺少的东西。我真的不在乎这一切结束后我会做什么。只要能和我的亲人们在一起，我就会很幸福。" 他的皱眉逐渐变成了微笑，他抬起头来。"你的梦想是什么，渚薰——" 真嗣在看到银发少年的那一刻停了下来。渚薰的深红色眼睛在头顶的灯光下闪烁着。他的嘴微微张开。"渚薰，你还好吗？"

"You truly feel that way, don't you?" His voice was hushed and serious, a strong contrast to how it was before.  
"你真的这么觉得，是吗？" 他的声音低沉而严肃，与之前截然不同。

"Well, yeah." He nodded. "That's beautiful, Shinji." Taking in a deep breath, Kaworu turned away from Shinji and gazed blankly ahead. Never before had he heard of such tenderness. In his experience, humans did nothing but manipulate others to achieve what they wanted, which in turn was why he manipulated them. However, Shinji was different than the humans he knew. He wasn't out for his own personal advancement. He was there for those he cared about and nothing more. Truly, Shinji was a selfless individual. And the pure heart of Shinji Ikari had been the reason for his love to him, right?  
"嗯，是的。" 他点头道。"那很美，真嗣。" 深吸一口气，渚薰转过身去，不再看真嗣，茫然地望向前方。他从未听过如此温柔的话语。在他的经历中，人类不过是利用他人来达到自己的目的，这也是他利用他们的原因。然而，真嗣与那些他所认识的人不同。他并不追求个人利益，只是为了他所关心的人，仅此而已。确实，真嗣是一个无私的人。而碇真嗣纯洁的心灵，正是他爱上他的原因，对吧？

"Excuse me." He spoke, rising up to his feet. "I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow, Shinji."  
"抱歉。" 他说着，站起身来。"我得走了。明天见，真嗣。"

"Wait, Kaworu, I still…" Before he could get his sentence out, Kaworu was already making his way down the catwalk and showed no signs of turning back to answer his call. Realizing that calling out to him would be in vain, Shinji gave up on it and let out a sigh before rising to his feet as well. It was getting late, and he wouldn't want to get late for class.  
"等等，薰，我还有话…" 他话还没说完，薰已经沿着走道离去，丝毫没有回头回应的意思。意识到呼唤他只是徒劳，真嗣放弃了，叹了口气，也站起身来。天色已晚，他可不想上课迟到。

Ritsuko took in a puff of her cigarette before moving it from her lips, blowing a cloud of smoke into the shadowy room while cradling a manila folder under her free arm. Aside from the lights inside of the empty cylindrical tube in the center of the room, the only illumination to be found was the glowing orange light from the tip of her cigarette. The fake blonde leaned against the giant tube, her feet tapping rhythmically.  
律子吸了一口烟，然后从唇边移开，向昏暗的房间里吐出一团烟雾，同时用空着的那只胳膊夹着一个马尼拉文件夹。除了房间中央空心圆柱管内的灯光外，唯一的光源就是她香烟头上的橙色光亮。这位金发假美人靠在巨大的管子上，脚有节奏地敲打着。

With the Commander missing, the blonde saw no drawbacks against her actions. Hearing the echoing sound of boots on metal, Ritsuko turned her head towards the incoming person. "About time you got here." She said, dropping her cigarette to the ground and stomping it  
由于指挥官失踪，金发女子认为她的行动没有任何不利之处。听到金属上靴子的回声，律子转头看向走来的人。"你终于来了。" 她说着，将烟蒂丢在地上踩灭。

out with her right high heel, twisting it into the ground to extinguish it. "Without Gendo interfering me, I could finally get this done."  
"用右脚的高跟鞋踩灭了它。“没有碇源堂的干扰，我终于可以完成这件事了。”

Misato stopped mid-stride upon hearing her refer to Commander Ikari by his first name, but shook it off and continued making her way towards the scientist. From what Shinji told her apparently Ritsuko had been maintaining a physical relationship with the Commander.  
"听到她直呼碇司令的名字，美里停下了脚步，但随即摇摇头继续向科学家走去。据真嗣所说，显然赤木律子一直与司令保持着肉体关系。

She had always wondered how in the world did Gendo attracted three separate brilliant female scientists. "Sorry." She replied. "I got a little bit lost. I've never been down here before." Katsuragi rubbed her hands on her arms. Even with her jacket on, she could still feel chills running up her arms. "So what did you call me down here for? It must be something important if you brought me all the way down here to the guts of Terminal Dogma while the Commander can't know about it."  
"她一直好奇碇源堂是如何吸引到三位各自杰出的女性科学家的。“抱歉。”她回答道，“我有点走神了。我以前从没来过这里。”葛城搓了搓手臂。即使穿着夹克，她仍能感觉到寒意沿着手臂上升。“你叫我来这里是为了什么？一定是很重要的事，否则你不会带我深入到终端教条的核心区域，而且不能让司令知道。”

Dr. Akagi let a faint chuckle escape her, though it came off more like  
赤木律子博士轻声笑了出来，尽管听起来更像是

a scoff. "Oh, he already knows. He just doesn't know that I'm telling you about it."  
一声嗤笑。“哦，他早就知道了。只是他还不知道我已经告诉你了。”

"About what?" The lavender-haired woman cut straight to the chase. She had long since grown tired of Ritsuko's insistence on beating around the bush before finally getting to her point.  
“关于什么？”紫发女子直截了当地问道。她早已厌倦了赤木坚持在切入正题前绕弯子。

"It's about the new pilot." She answered, pulling herself up from against the tube, "I have the documents right here with the pilot file." She explained, holding up the manila folder in front of her.  
"是关于新驾驶员的。" 她回答道，从管子旁站起身来，"我这里有他的档案文件。" 她解释着，举起手中的牛皮纸文件夹。

"Let me see that." Misato snagged the folder out of Ritsuko's hand, to which the scientist had no protest.  
"让我看看。" 美里从律子手中夺过文件夹，而科学家对此并无异议。

"Look through the pilot's file." Dr. Akagi's brown eyes started to narrow into little slits as she beamed at Misato as if some sort of forewarning of what she would find amongst those documents. Slowly lowering her eyes back down to the folder, Misato scanned through the first page of the pilot's file. His name was Kaworu Nagisa, and below his printed name was his mugshot. His skin was rather pale, and his features were slender to the point where they  
"看看驾驶员的档案。" 赤木博士的棕色眼睛开始眯成细缝，她带着某种预兆般的光芒注视着美里。美里缓缓将目光移回文件夹，浏览着驾驶员档案的第一页。他的名字是渚薰，名字下方是他的证件照。他的肤色相当苍白，五官纤细至极。

were almost feminine. His shaggy hair was almost silver in color, and his eyes were a strong, piercing crimson. She immediately recognized him as the seventeenth Angel; his appearance and name matched perfectly with Shinji's description.  
几乎带着女性般的柔美。他那蓬松的头发近乎银色，而他的眼睛则是深邃而锐利的猩红色。她立刻认出他就是第十七使徒；他的外貌和名字与真嗣的描述完全吻合。

"He looks like Rei." She let out, looking back up at Akagi. Misato wasn't about to just let the information out.  
“他看起来像丽。”她脱口而出，抬头看向赤城。美里并不打算轻易透露这些信息。

"The resemblance is almost uncanny, isn't it?" She smirked. "Albino, angelic features. It's almost as if they were related."  
“相似得近乎诡异，不是吗？”她微微一笑。“白化病，天使般的特征。简直就像是有血缘关系一样。”

"What are you getting at?" She decided to play Ritsuko's game.  
"你到底想说什么？" 她决定加入律子的游戏。

"Check his birthday." The Major glanced back down at the file and read the date aloud. "September thirteenth, two-thousand. The same day as Second Impact." There was a momentary pause while Misato looked down at the file once again, flipping through the papers, but not doing anything more than merely glossing over them. "Where's the rest of his file?"  
"检查他的生日。" 少校再次瞥了一眼文件，大声读出日期。"九月十三日，两千年。与第二次冲击同一天。" 美里短暂地停顿了一下，再次低头翻阅文件，但并没有深入阅读，只是匆匆扫过。"他的其他资料呢？"

"That is his file, Major."  
"那就是他的全部资料，少校。"

"No way." She shook her head while flipping back through the papers to see if there was anything she had missed. "There's hardly any information on him. There aren't even any records from before two-thousand-fourteen." Of course the Major had already expected something like this, but she was still hoping to know more about the Angel. Even Shinji didn't know much about his origin.  
"不可能。" 她摇着头，翻回文件查看是否遗漏了什么。"关于他的信息少得可怜。甚至没有两千零十四年之前的记录。" 当然，这位少校早已预料到这种情况，但她仍希望了解更多关于天使的信息。就连真嗣对他的来历也知之甚少。

"That's because just like Rei, his history has been erased."  
"那是因为和绫波一样，他的历史被抹去了。"

Katsuragi stopped and inhaled before closing the folder and tucking it under her arm. "What's the point of showing me all this? You've been so secretive up until now. What gives?"  
葛城停下动作，深吸一口气，合上文件夹并夹在腋下。"给我看这些有什么意义？你一直这么神秘兮兮的。现在是怎么回事？"

"Let's just say that we may have different goals, but we share common enemies." Ritsuko's facial expression was unchanged.  
"这么说吧，我们的目标或许不同，但我们有共同的敌人。" 赤城律子的面部表情丝毫未变。

"I'm getting sick and tired of this vague bullshit, Akagi!" Misato snapped, crossing her arms and gritting her teeth. "If you're going to tell me something, then just tell me already!"  
"我已经受够了这种含糊其辞的废话，赤城！" 美里厉声说道，交叉双臂，咬紧牙关。"如果你有什么要告诉我的，就直接说出来！"

Ritsuko took in a deep breath and sighed as she exhaled. Her posture starting to slouch just a little bit. "Would you believe me if I told you that Rei wasn't human?"  
律子深吸一口气，叹息着呼出。她的姿势开始微微有些驼背。"如果我告诉你绫波不是人类，你会相信吗？"

Misato stared at her for a moment, as if looking for the correct answer from within herself. She knew the origin of Rei; Shinji had told her about Rei being a clone of his mother Yui Ikari and the Second Angel. However, she still found it almost sickening about the concept of Rei being something inhuman was to her. Rei was a young girl, a young girl that she had watched over and even cared for to an extent. Perhaps not to the same extent as Asuka and Shinji, but even so, the sentiment was still there. "Yeah." She sighed, "Yeah, I'd believe you."  
美里盯着她看了一会儿，仿佛在内心寻找正确的答案。她知道丽（绫波零）的来历；真嗣曾告诉过她，丽是他的母亲碇唯和第二使徒的克隆体。然而，她仍然觉得丽作为非人类的概念几乎令人作呕。丽是一个年轻女孩，一个她曾照顾过甚至在某种程度上关心过的女孩。也许不像对明日香和真嗣那样深，但即便如此，那份情感依然存在。“嗯。”她叹了口气，“嗯，我相信你。”

"Good," Ritsuko replied as she pulled out a black remote from her pocket. "Then perhaps this won't come as much of a shock to you." With the press of the button, orange lights illuminated the borders of the dark, circular room. Misato looked towards the lights and let out a gasp of horror at the sight. Outside of the confines of the room was a large pool of LCL, separated by thick layers of glass. Inside of the orange pools were countless nude humanoid figures floating around inside. For all intents and purposes, they looked exactly like Rei.  
“很好，”律子回答，同时从口袋里掏出一个黑色遥控器。“那么，这或许不会让你太震惊。”她按下按钮，橙色的灯光照亮了黑暗的圆形房间的边缘。美里朝灯光望去，看到那景象时惊恐地倒吸了一口气。房间外是一个巨大的 LCL 池，被厚厚的玻璃层隔开。在橙色的池水中，无数赤裸的人形生物在其中漂浮。就所有目的而言，她们看起来和丽一模一样。

They had pale skin, shoulder-length blue hair, and identical features to the Rei that she had come to know. The only thing that was different about them was their eyes. Their wide, crimson eyes remained void of any spark, any sign that there was a soul behind them. They just idly floated inside of the LCL, staring into the center of the room as though it was their only purpose in existence. "Oh my God." She let out, feeling her heart cease its beating for a good few seconds, causing her blood to run cold. "I..i..is that… Are those… those things Rei?"  
他们肤色苍白，肩部长着齐肩的蓝发，面容与她所熟知的零完全相同。唯一的区别在于他们的眼睛。那双宽大的猩红眼眸空洞无光，没有任何火花，没有任何迹象表明灵魂藏于其后。他们只是懒散地漂浮在 LCL 中，凝视着房间中央，仿佛那是他们存在的唯一目的。“哦，我的天。”她脱口而出，感到心脏停止跳动了几秒钟，血液变得冰冷。“我……我……那是……那些是……那些东西是零吗？”

"Indeed." Ritsuko answered, her tone void of anything more than mild interest. "We're inside of the Dummy Plug's core. The entire  
“确实。”律子回答，语气中除了轻微的兴趣外别无他物。“我们正处于模拟插头的核心内部。整个”

Dummy Plug system itself is based on the thought patterns of these husks."  
模拟插头系统本身是基于这些躯壳的思维模式构建的。”

"Don't call them that!" Misato snarled, jerking around to face her. "These things are human, damn it!" She wasn't sure if she was trying to convince Ritsuko or herself of that. Apart from all the information she knew, Misato still found it disturbing to see the imagery herself.  
"别那么叫它们！" 美里咆哮着，猛地转身面对她。"这些家伙是人类，该死的！" 她不确定自己是在试图说服律子还是自己。除了她所知道的所有信息，美里仍然觉得亲眼看到这些影像令人不安。

"No, they're not." She shook her head, leaning back against the tube. "They're clones. Every single one of them. Just like Rei."  
"不，它们不是。" 她摇摇头，靠在管子上。"它们是克隆体。每一个都是。就像丽一样。"

Katsuragi looked back at the soulless creatures and stared at them. All of them were void of any sign of a life of their own. They were hollow. Vacant. Empty. Nothing about them was human. "Rei is a human." Though she couldn't hold a defense for these shells made of flesh, she could stand for the strange, quiet girl she had grown to know over the past year.  
葛城回头看着那些没有灵魂的生物，凝视着它们。它们全都缺乏任何属于自己的生命迹象。它们空洞。空虚。空无一物。它们身上没有一点人类的特质。"丽是人类。" 尽管她无法为这些肉体制成的空壳辩护，但她可以为过去一年里逐渐了解的那个奇怪、安静的女孩站出来。

"Rei is just like them." Akagi scoffed, revealing a tinge of disdain in her voice. "She's just a husk! A fake! She isn't a human! She's a creation! A science experiment!" Ritsuko's voice became louder and louder as anger started seeping through her tone. "She's… She's…." Stopping herself, the faux blonde took in a deep breath and looked down at her feet, allowing herself to recompose. "The point I'm trying to make is that Rei isn't human. You can make up whatever philosophical reasoning you want to convince yourself otherwise, but biologically, she isn't human. She's a creation. And for Kaworu to share so many similarities with her makes me believe that…"  
"丽和他们一样。" 赤木嗤之以鼻，语气中透露出一丝轻蔑。"她只是个空壳！一个赝品！她不是人！她是创造物！一个科学实验！" 律子的声音越来越大，愤怒开始渗透进她的语调。"她……她……" 她停了下来，金发假面深吸一口气，低头看着自己的脚，让自己重新镇定。"我想说的是，丽不是人类。你可以用任何哲学理由来说服自己，但从生物学上讲，她不是人类。她是创造物。而渚与她有如此多的相似之处，让我相信……"

"He's a clone as well?" Misato asked.  
"他也是个克隆体吗？" 美里问道。

"Perhaps." She replied, lifting up the remote again, holding it merely inches from her face as she stared blankly at the device. "But I think he may be something more than that."  
"或许。" 她回答，再次举起遥控器，仅在眼前几英寸处凝视着设备。"但我认为他可能不仅仅是那样。"

"Like what?" The Major fixed her eyes on Ritsuko, awaiting her answer. Closing her eyes, she let out a deep exhale. She was waiting for a good moment to tell her the truth.  
“比如什么？” 葛城美里紧盯着律子，等待她的回答。她闭上眼睛，深深地呼出一口气。她在等待一个合适的时机，告诉她真相。

"I don't know." With that, Dr. Akagi pressed the button on a remote, causing for the pool of LCL to bubble. Turning around to see what was going on, Misato watched as the numerous Rei clones began to break down before her very eyes, dissolving into the LCL.  
“我不知道。” 说完，赤木律子按下了遥控器上的按钮，使得 LCL 池开始冒泡。美里转身查看发生了什么，只见众多绫波零的克隆体在她眼前开始分解，溶解进 LCL 中。

"What the Hell are you doing?!" She spun back around and drew her pistol, aiming it at Ritsuko. The blonde moved her eyes to glace at Misato, but showed no signs of fear in her expression as she stared down the barrel of Katsuragi's 9-millimeter. If anything, she looked completely apathetic about it.  
“你到底在干什么？！” 她迅速转回身，拔出手枪对准律子。金发女子将目光移向美里，但脸上没有显露出一丝恐惧，她直视着葛城美里的 9 毫米手枪枪口。如果说有什么表情的话，她看起来完全对此漠不关心。

"Destroying the Dummy Plug." She replied.  
"摧毁模拟插入栓。" 她回答道。

"But why?!" The lavender-haired woman tightened her grip on the pistol, wrapping her finger around the trigger.  
"但为什么？！" 紫发女子紧握手枪，手指环绕在扳机上。

"I have my own reasons." She sighed. "If you're going to kill me, then just do it already. Quite frankly, I'd be happy about it."  
"我有自己的理由。" 她叹了口气。"如果你要杀我，那就动手吧。坦白说，我会为此感到高兴。"

Misato turned around while keeping her pistol aimed at Dr. Akagi and watched as the remains of the Rei clones continue to deteriorate.  
美里转过身，手中的手枪始终对准赤木博士，同时注视着那些绫波复制体的残骸继续腐化。

Though only bits and pieces of them remained, their eyes still carried the same void stare they had from the moments the lights came on. They merely continued staring on, blankly. No pain. No suffering.  
尽管只剩下零星碎片，它们的眼睛依旧保持着灯光亮起那一刻的空洞凝视。它们只是继续茫然地盯着前方，没有痛苦，没有煎熬。

Nothing. If anything, killing these things was granting them mercy. She could have stopped her; she didn't because Shinji had told her that it was Rei's decision to let Ritsuko destroy the clones. She didn't want to be replaceable anymore. Misato shook her head and pulled out a pair of handcuffs from her pocket. "Put this on."  
什么都没有。如果说有什么的话，杀死这些东西反而是给了它们慈悲。她本可以阻止她；但她没有，因为真嗣告诉她，这是绫波自己的决定，让律子摧毁这些复制体。她不想再被替代了。美里摇了摇头，从口袋里掏出一副手铐。“戴上这个。”

Ritsuko said nothing and took the handcuff from the Major. Silently putting them on, she kept her head low and walked toward the Major.  
律子什么也没说，从真嗣手中接过手铐。她默默地戴上，低着头，向真嗣走去。

Misato sighed, "Look, Rits. I don't want to do this, but you've left me no choice." She walked behind the blonde, pushing her shoulder to give her the direction. "However, I have more to talk about the Sixth Child."  
美里叹了口气，"律子，我不想这么做，但你逼得我别无选择。"她走到金发女子身后，推了推她的肩膀指示方向。"不过，关于第六适格者，我还有更多要谈的。"

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow, "I don't really know more about him." "He's probably the last Angel." Misato blurted out plainly.  
律子挑了挑眉，"我对他的了解并不多。" "他很可能就是最后一个使徒。"美里直截了当地脱口而出。

The Major could feel clearly Ritsuko's body tensing up, "Wh-what makes you think that?" the truth was Ritsuko had been suspecting something like this; She knew why did Rei have the crimson eyes.  
"玛吉尔可以清楚地感觉到律子的身体紧绷起来，“什、什么让你这么认为？”事实上，律子一直怀疑着类似的事情；她知道为什么绫波会有那双深红色的眼睛。”

"Nothing. Just sixth-sense."  
“没什么，只是第六感。”

Shinji sat on the couch with Asuka cuddling on to him. The TV has been playing for hours, and none of the two pilots were paying attention anymore. They had just caught a break from a make-out session, and they were content with what they had. "Hey Asuka, what do we do with Kaworu?" Shinji suddenly spoke; his tone was a bit dry.  
"真嗣坐在沙发上，明日香依偎在他怀里。电视已经开了好几个小时，两位驾驶员都没再关注。他们刚刚从一场热吻中抽身，对现状感到满足。“嘿，明日香，我们该怎么处理薰呢？”真嗣突然开口，语气略显干涩。”

"Hmmm? Kaworu? The last Angel? The silver-haired narcissistic homosexual human-shaped Angel bastard you were talking about?" Asuka mocked, raising an eyebrow. Although she was a tsundere and tended to say things she didn't really mean, but this time she was being truthful with her impression of Kaworu.  
"嗯？渚薰？最后一个使徒？那个银发自恋的同性恋人形使徒混蛋？" 明日香嘲讽道，挑起眉毛。虽然她是个傲娇，经常说些口是心非的话，但这次她对渚薰的印象是真心的。

"Don't say that, he was my friend." Shinji frowned. He didn't really wanted to contradict with his girlfriend, and he also knew some of the descriptions were kinda true, but Shinji was nothing but polite.  
"别这么说，他是我的朋友。" 真嗣皱眉道。他并不想和女友争执，也知道有些描述确实属实，但真嗣始终保持着礼貌。

Asuka sighed, "I don't know what happened in your timeline, Shinji. But back in my timeline, he almost wasted no time and went directly for Lilith with my Unit 02. And you practically died because of him.  
明日香叹了口气，"我不知道在你的时间线里发生了什么，真嗣。但在我的时间线里，他几乎没浪费时间，直接带着我的二号机去找莉莉丝了。而你几乎因为他而丧命。

How could I not hate him? And his whole attitude… it just creeps me out."  
我怎能不恨他？还有他那副态度……真是让我毛骨悚然。

"Wh-what? Oh, I remembered you telling me that I got absorbed into Unit 01 again…" Shinji swallowed, sitting up straight from his cuddling position, "I don't want to fight him… although he is an Angel, but he is human enough to me."  
“什-什么？哦，我想起来了，你告诉过我我又被吸收进 01 号机了……” 真嗣咽了咽口水，从依偎的姿势中坐直身子，“我不想和他战斗……虽然他是使徒，但他对我来说已经足够像个人类了。”

"Yeah, yeah. He befriended you in your timeline, didn't he?"  
“是啊，是啊。他在你的时间线里和你成了朋友，对吧？”

Shinji nodded, "He was so nice to me. Although I had you that time, I still became his friend," Shinji sighed, "then just got betrayed by him."  
真嗣点点头，“他对我很好。虽然那时有你在，我还是成了他的朋友，”真嗣叹了口气，“结果却被他背叛了。”

Asuka pouted, "Hmph. It seemed my counterpart didn't do a good job keeping you private," she smiled evilly, climbing on top Shinji and looking down at him passionately; she deliberately revealed part of her breasts seductively, looking down at Shinji's blushed and wide- eyed face she continued, "Well Baka, I'm just claiming my property here!" Without another word, she leaned forward and pulled Shinji into a fierce kiss, who reciprocated with eagerness.  
明日香撅起嘴，“哼。看来我的对手没做好保护你隐私的工作，”她邪魅一笑，爬到真嗣上方，热情地俯视着他；她故意露出部分胸部，诱惑地看着真嗣涨红的脸和睁大的眼睛，继续说道，“好吧，笨蛋，我只是在宣示我的所有权！”没等真嗣反应，她便俯身拉近，给了他一个热烈的吻，真嗣也热情地回应。

"Tadaima!" Misato's voice suddenly came from the door.  
“我回来了！”美里突然从门口传来声音。

Both teens immediately flung away from each other; Asuka resumed her sitting position and quickly adjusted her messy hair and clothes, while Shinji stood up and rushed to the kitchen.  
两个少年立刻分开；明日香恢复了坐姿，迅速整理她凌乱的头发和衣服，而真嗣则起身冲向厨房。

Misato came into the living room and saw Asuka first. Although her hair and clothes were not as messy, but from her expression and blush Misato could easily deduce what happened from her more than a decade experience on the subject of physical intimacy. "My, my, Asuka. I know today's been a little hot, and it certainly raised your hormonal level as well."  
美里走进客厅，首先看到的是明日香。尽管她的头发和衣服没有那么凌乱，但从她的表情和脸红中，美里凭借十几年来对亲密行为的经验，轻易地推断出了发生了什么。“哎呀，明日香。我知道今天有点热，当然也提高了你的荷尔蒙水平。”

Asuka's blush grew deeper hearing the words, "What the hell are you implying by that? I'm not as indecent and irresponsible as an adult like you!"  
听到这些话，明日香的脸更红了，“你到底在暗示什么？我可不像你这样的成年人那样无耻和不负责任！”

"Just be careful, I know we don't have that many pilots around but  
"小心点，我知道我们没有那么多飞行员，但是"

we don't need little pilots yet," Misato teased with a wink, "unless…"  
"我们还不需要小飞行员，""美里眨眼调侃道，""除非……"

"OKAY THAT WAS IT!" Asuka shot up from the couch and attacked her guardian vigorously, who was laughing and running around trying  
""好了，够了！""明日香从沙发上跳起来，猛烈地攻击她的监护人，后者大笑着四处逃窜

to dodge the attacks. Asuka had been so frustrated that their  
躲避攻击。明日香感到非常沮丧，因为他们的

foreplay had been interrupted, and with the Major irritating her further she needed somewhere to vent her anger.  
前戏被打断了，再加上少校进一步激怒了她，她需要找个地方发泄怒火。

Shinji simply ignored the whole ordeal and immersed himself in cooking. Minutes later Asuka finally caught the Major, who was lying on the ground laughing and panting with Asuka sitting on her waist, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.  
真嗣则完全无视了这场闹剧，专心致志地烹饪。几分钟后，明日香终于抓住了少校，后者躺在地上笑得上气不接下气，明日香坐在她的腰上，低头看着她，脸上带着难以捉摸的表情。

"Ticklish attack!" Asuka suddenly cried out, using her fingers to jab Misato's sensitive area.  
“挠痒攻击！”明日香突然喊道，用手指戳向美里敏感的部位。

The Major had yet to die down from the previous laughter and was sent into another wave of uncontrollable ecstasy. "Hahaha… s-stop, A-Asuka, Hahahaha… s-stop… Hahaha… p-please, i-it was my-my bad, aight? Hahaha…"  
美里少校还未从之前的笑声中平复，又被卷入另一波无法控制的狂喜。“哈哈哈……停、停下，明-明日香，哈哈哈……停……哈哈哈……求、求你了，我-我错了，行吗？哈哈哈……”

Seeing Misato begging for mercy, Asuka felt satisfied with the outcome and stopped tickling the poor Major. "Hmph. You asked for it!" She swiftly got off Misato, allowing the latter to stand up.  
看到美里求饶，明日香对结果感到满意，便停止了对可怜少校的挠痒。“哼。你自找的！”她迅速从美里身上下来，让后者得以起身。

"Anyways, I wanted to talk about the new pilot," Misato said, her expression changed from the big-sister-Misato to Major Katsuragi in a blink of an eye, "What do we do with him?"  
“总之，我想谈谈新来的驾驶员，”美里说，她的表情瞬间从大姐姐美里变成了葛城少校，“我们该怎么处理他？”

Asuka sat down on the couch, her head resting in her palm, "well, I'd say we kill him; it's that easy." She never felt anything towards the Angel boy, much less compassion. To be honest, if it was not Shinji she would gladly end his life with her EVA, although it didn't exist anymore. Thinking rationally, it was the only way; Kaworu was an Angel, it was him or the humanity. In this kind of situation, Asuka had always been thinking with logic, while Shinji seemed to think with more emotions involved.  
明日香坐在沙发上，头靠在手掌上，“嗯，我觉得我们杀了他；就这么简单。”她对那个天使少年从未有过任何感觉，更别提同情了。说实话，如果不是真嗣，她会很乐意用她的 EVA 结束他的生命，尽管它已经不存在了。理性思考，这是唯一的方法；薰是天使，不是他就是人类。在这种情境下，明日香总是用逻辑思考，而真嗣似乎更多地受情感影响。

However Asuka could understand why it was hard for Shinji to kill Kaworu. After all, she was not a coldhearted individual. It would definitely be difficult for someone to kill their friend. Hell, normal people would hesitate just by the appearance of Kaworu; he looked too much like a human. Asuka tried to think what if Hikari was the  
然而，明日香能理解为什么真嗣很难杀掉薰。毕竟，她不是冷酷无情的人。对某人来说，杀死朋友肯定很难。见鬼，普通人光是看到薰的外表就会犹豫；他看起来太像人类了。明日香试着想象如果光是那个

final Angel and how she would act; not surprisingly, she found it impossible to decide. It was then she felt empathetic towards her boyfriend.  
最终的绫波零会如何行动；不出所料，她发现自己无法决定。这时，她对她的男朋友产生了同理心。

"Dinner's almost ready!" Shinji's announcement snapped Asuka out of her train of thought, "Good! I smell Sauerkraut."  
"晚餐快好了！" 真嗣的宣布打断了明日香的思绪，"好极了！我闻到了酸菜的味道。"

Misato decided that their conversation could wait. While she and Asuka waited around the table, Rei's voice suddenly came, "Tadaima."  
美里决定他们的对话可以稍后再谈。当她和明日香在桌旁等待时，丽的声音突然响起，"我回来了。"

"Rei! Welcome," Misato turned her head towards the entrance seeing a blue-haired girl emerging, "we're just about to have dinner; you can join us if you want!"  
"丽！欢迎，"美里转头望向门口，看到一个蓝发女孩出现，"我们正要吃晚饭；你想加入我们吗！"

"I will not be joining your meal," Rei said with a bit of sadness in her tone.  
"我不会加入你们的用餐，"丽带着一丝悲伤的语气说道。

"Why, wondergirl? You don't like Baka-Shinji's cooking? Well too bad he actually made something vegetarian today!" Asuka said.  
"为什么，奇迹女孩？你不喜欢笨蛋真嗣的烹饪吗？可惜他今天居然做了素食！"明日香说道。

"I did not inform Shinji-kun in advance about my visit. He had already started cooking then. I do not think he made my portion; thus, I would not be joining," Rei said in a matter-of-fact tone.  
"我没有提前通知真嗣君我要来访。那时他已经开始做饭了。我想他并没有准备我的份；因此，我不会加入，" 绫波用一种实事求是的语气说道。

"That's no problem, Shinji and I can share our food with you! It's not like we needed to eat them to stay alive anyway," Asuka said.  
"那没问题，真嗣和我可以和你分享我们的食物！反正我们也不是非吃不可才能活下去，" 明日香说道。

Shinji turned around as well, "Actually, Rei, I messed up portioning and there will be extra food and I was wondering how to deal with it," Shinji smiled a little, "If you'd join us, you'd be solving a big problem."  
真嗣也转过身来，"实际上，绫波，我在分量上搞砸了，会有多余的食物，我正想着怎么处理呢，" 真嗣微微一笑，"如果你能加入我们，那就解决了一个大问题。"

Rei also smiled, "Your proposal is acceptable; I will be joining your meal."  
丽也微笑着说：“你的提议可以接受；我将加入你们的餐会。”

With that being said the pilots and the Major all sat around the table, waiting for the meal to be served. Shinji came and placed the plates; the smell of the food was so good that Asuka and Misato wasted no  
说完这些，驾驶员们和少校都围坐在桌旁，等待着饭菜上桌。真嗣过来摆放盘子；食物的香气如此诱人，以至于明日香和美里立刻开始狼吞虎咽。

time starting to devour their portion. Rei, on the other hand, was much gentler. Shinji joined them quickly. The happy family ate in comfortable silence, content expressions on their faces.  
而丽则更为文雅。真嗣很快也加入了他们。这个幸福的家庭在舒适的沉默中用餐，脸上洋溢着满足的表情。

A quarter hour later, everyone had finished the meal; Misato was the first to stand up, "Rei, would you like to stay here for a while? We have something to discuss." The truth was she was hoping to talk with Rei about Kaworu in the beginning, but she wasn't able to find her in her apartment. Now Rei just came here herself, much to the Major's surprise.  
一刻钟后，众人用餐完毕；美里率先起身，“丽，你愿意在这里待一会儿吗？我们有些事情要讨论。”实际上，她最初希望与丽谈谈关于薰的事情，但在她的公寓里没能找到她。现在丽自己来了，让美里颇感意外。

"I do plan to stay here to discuss matters about Nagisa; it is my purpose coming here in the first place," Rei replied.  
“我确实打算留下来讨论关于渚的事情；这正是我来此的目的，”丽回答道。

"O-okay," Misato said; she didn't expect the response, but she didn't mind it. "Alright, guys, now serious stuff. What do we plan to do with him?" She put her index finger on Asuka's lips before she could say anything.  
“好-好吧，”美里说道；她没料到这个回答，但并不介意。“好了，各位，现在谈正事。我们打算怎么处理他？”她用食指按住了明日香正要说话的嘴唇。

"Emmm, I-he's an Angel, so… although I don't want to, but… I mean… he's a human, at least he looked like a human… maybe he's like us?" Shinji said, his expression sad and melancholy. He knew what he had to do, but he's nothing if not sympathetic and kind.  
"嗯，他是个天使，所以…虽然我不想这么做，但是…我是说…他至少看起来像个人类…也许他和我们一样？" 真嗣说道，表情悲伤而忧郁。他知道自己必须做什么，但他若非同情心泛滥和善良，便一无是处。

"I am aware of the fact that Shinji, Asuka, and me all possess Angelic powers but in human form," Rei said, "but we do not experience the Call from Adam or Lilith."  
"我知道真嗣、明日香和我都拥有天使般的力量，但以人类形态存在，" 绫波说，"但我们并未感受到来自亚当或莉莉丝的召唤。"

Misato sighed, "I know that Rei. And that's exactly the reason why we have to… neutralize him." She turned her gaze to Shinji, "I'm sorry, Shin-chan. It has to be done."  
美里叹了口气，"我知道，绫波。而这正是我们必须…中和他。"她转向真嗣，"对不起，真嗣君。这是必须做的。"

"I-I understand, Misato-san," Shinji replied, "I-I just… I don't think I'm able to do it."  
"我-我明白，美里小姐，" 真嗣回答道，"我-我只是…我觉得我做不到。"

"Well then I'll do it for you!" Asuka said, "I don't want you to bear the burden, Shinji. Leave the responsibility to our best pilot, shall we?"  
"那我就替你做吧！" 明日香说，"我不想让你承担这个负担，真嗣。把责任交给我们的最佳驾驶员，好吗？"

"Asuka… but NERV thinks you're dead from the self-destruct of Unit 02, aren't they?"  
"明日香…但 NERV 认为你在二号机的自毁中已经死了，不是吗？"

"Damn it, I forgot about that…" Asuka sighed in defeat.  
“该死，我忘了这茬…” 明日香叹息着认输。

"Considering now we only have Unit 00 that is made from Adam, he would have no choice but hijack it," Rei said, "that leaves the responsibility to you, Shinji-kun."  
“考虑到我们现在只有用亚当制造的零号机，他别无选择只能劫持它，”绫波说，“这责任就落在你身上了，真嗣君。”

"I-I guess… but, I still want to talk to him." Shinji said, his voice sorrowful.  
“我——我想……但我还是想和他谈谈。”真嗣说道，声音中带着悲伤。

Asuka sighed, "Baka, do whatever you want. Just… be careful, okay? I'm sure he noticed your AT-Field, just like Rei and I do."  
明日香叹了口气，“笨蛋，随你便吧。只是……小心点，好吗？我敢肯定他也注意到了你的 AT 力场，就像我和绫波一样。”

"That is correct. Nephilim could sense other's AT-Fields. He must have been aware of your powers," Rei followed nonchalantly, her gaze fixated on her half-brother.  
“没错。Nephilim 能感知到他人的 AT 力场。他肯定已经察觉到了你的力量，”绫波不以为意地接着说，目光紧盯着她的半血兄弟。

"Thanks," Shinji said with a warm smile, "I will."  
“谢谢，”真嗣带着温暖的微笑说，“我会的。”

Kaworu looked up at the ceiling of his room while he laid on his bed, his hands rested behind his head. The words that Shinji had said had been running through his head for hours, and yet he still couldn't come to a true understanding of them. He found it almost mind- boggling that a human could be satisfied with only having those they care about. Before today he knew humans only as vile and power- hungry creatures. They sought out nothing but personal gain. Yet here was this child who had seen more horrors in a year than most see in their entire lives, and all he desired was to be with his loved ones. Were most humans like this?  
渚薰躺在床上，双手枕在脑后，抬头望着天花板。真嗣说的话在他脑海中萦绕了数小时，他却始终无法真正理解。他几乎难以置信，一个人仅凭关心的人就能感到满足。在此之前，他认为人类只是卑鄙且贪婪的生物，追求的不过是个人利益。然而，这个孩子在一年内所经历的恐怖比大多数人一生中见过的还要多，而他所渴望的只是与所爱之人在一起。大多数人类都是这样的吗？

'But… he's not exactly Lilin, is he?' Kaworu thought, 'but I can still sense in most of my other lives I befriended Shinji. Maybe his heart is pure.'  
'但是……他并不完全是莉莉丝的后裔，对吧？' 渚薰思索着，'但我仍能在我其他生命中感受到与真嗣的友谊。也许他的心灵是纯净的。'

In the end though, it didn't matter what he believed. Regardless of his personal feelings of the matter, he was bound to Adam, and in turn destined to return to him. Once he was reunited with the father of Angels, then all life on this world would come to an end, and a new one would rise from the remains. This would herald in a new age, an age in which Angels would rule over this planet, thriving and flourishing in that which they would claim as their new home; An age in which the lives of an insignificant race would be exchanged for the lives of one that was just slightly more significant.  
然而最终，他相信什么并不重要。无论他对这件事的个人感受如何，他注定要与亚当结合，并注定要回到他身边。一旦他与天使之父重聚，这个世界上的所有生命都将终结，一个新的世界将从废墟中崛起。这将迎来一个新时代，一个天使将统治这个星球，在其新家园中繁荣昌盛的时代；一个用微不足道的种族的生命换取略显重要的种族的生命的时代。

"Rei, I have a request for you." Fuyutsuki intercepted Rei in the hallway leading to the change rooms, "Could you please come with me for a second?"  
“丽，我有个请求。”冬月在通往更衣室的走廊上拦住了丽，“你能跟我来一下吗？”

It was rare for Fuyutsuki to _ask,_ much less ask _Rei_ . He could have ordered Rei to come with him; he was the Sub-Commander, after all. Now with Gendo missing, he was the actual Commander of NERV. But for some reason, he decided to kindly ask.  
冬月很少请求，更不用说请求丽了。他本可以命令丽跟他走；毕竟，他是副司令。现在源堂失踪了，他实际上是 NERV 的指挥官。但出于某种原因，他决定礼貌地请求。

Rei Ayanami had just come out from her EVA after a sync test. She was surprised at Fuyutsuki's behavior, not only by the fact that he actually asked, but also by calling her name, not just 'Pilot Ayanami.' "Yes, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki."  
绫波零刚刚从她的 EVA 中出来，完成了一次同步测试。她对冬月的行为感到惊讶，不仅因为他真的开口询问，还因为他叫了她的名字，而不是简单的‘驾驶员绫波’。“是的，副司令冬月。”

Fuyutsuki smiled, "This way. Please follow me." He led the way to a small office; Rei followed him and entered the room. Closing the door behind him, Fuyutsuki continued, "Rei, please go down to Central Dogma, and wait for the last Angel to attack."  
冬月微笑着说：“这边请，请跟我来。”他领路走向一个小办公室；绫波跟着他进入房间。关上门后，冬月继续说道：“绫波，请前往中央教条区，等待最后一个使徒的攻击。”

Rei blinked, "The last Angel?" She was surprised that NERV actually knew who the last Angel was.  
绫波眨了眨眼，“最后一个使徒？”她惊讶于 NERV 竟然知道最后一个使徒是谁。

"Thanks to some unknown informant, now we have sufficient intel to confirm the Sixth Child, Kaworu Nagisa, is the last Angel. Go to Central Dogma and wait; nullify his AT-Field with yours when the time comes."  
多亏了一位不知名的线人，我们现在有足够的情报确认第六使徒碇真嗣是最后一个使徒。前往中央教条区等待；届时用你的 AT 力场抵消他的。

Rei nodded, "Yes, sir."

The sound of music flowed from Shinji's headphones and through his ears while he sat on a bench. He just came out from the sync test and finished showering, waiting for Rei and Misato to go home together.  
音乐从真嗣的耳机中流淌而出，穿过他的耳朵，他正坐在长椅上。他刚刚完成了同步测试并洗完澡，等待着绫波和美里一起回家。

"Shinji." A voice called out to him, catching his attention. Shinji looked up as a familiar silver-haired pilot approached him, a smile on his face.  
“真嗣。”一个声音叫住了他，引起了他的注意。真嗣抬头望去，只见一位熟悉的银发驾驶员向他走来，脸上带着微笑。

"Oh, hey Kaworu." He returned the smile. "What're you doing here?" Shinji was waiting for another time and place to talk to Kaworu since there were surveillance cameras everywhere inside NERV medical wing. Still, if he came to him, then there was no reason to reject.  
"哦，嘿，薰。" 他回以微笑。"你在这里做什么？" 真嗣一直在等待另一个时间和地点与薰交谈，因为 NERV 医疗翼到处都是监控摄像头。不过，既然他来找他，那么就没有理由拒绝。

Nagisa's sharp crimson eyes softened a little, along with the rest of his features. "I heard you were here. So I thought I'd stop by and say hi." He answered before looking towards the empty seat next to the pilot of Unit D. "Mind if I take a seat?"  
渚的锐利深红眼眸柔和了一些，连同他的其他特征。"我听说你在这里。所以我想过来看看，打个招呼。" 他回答后，看向 D 单位驾驶员旁边的空座位。"介意我坐下吗？"

"Of course not." Shinji said, scooting over to the side to allow some more room for him to sit. "Go ahead." Slowly, the silver-haired pilot turned around and lowered himself onto the cushioned bench, resting one of his legs on his knee while leaning his back against the wall. "So how are you, Shinji?" He asked, his tone a little more mellow than normal.  
"当然不介意。" 真嗣说着，挪到一边为他腾出更多空间。"请坐。" 慢慢地，银发驾驶员转过身，缓缓坐到垫子上，一条腿搭在另一条膝盖上，背靠墙壁。"那么，你怎么样，真嗣？" 他问道，语气比平时稍微柔和一些。

"I'm fine." He replied, rolling up the wires of his headphones around his SDAT before putting it in his pocket. "Are you alright, Kaworu?  
"我没事。" 他回答道，将耳机线缠绕在他的 SDAT 上，然后放入口袋。"你还好吗，薰？"

You seem a little… down, I guess?"  
"你看起来有点…沮丧，大概？"

A faint grin emerged on Kaworu's features, just barely exposing some of the white in his teeth. "Shinji, could you please tell me why it is that your loved ones mean so much to you?"  
"薰的脸上浮现出一丝淡淡的微笑，只是隐约露出了一些牙齿的白色。"真嗣，你能告诉我为什么你所爱的人对你来说如此重要吗？"

Shinji blinked, a bit taken back by the question. "Huh?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，对这个问题有些意外。“啊？”

"You said that if you could have just one thing, one simple wish, it would be to have all of those you care about with you." He turned his head to face Shinji, his grin still present. "Why is that?"  
“你说过，如果只能许一个愿望，一个简单的愿望，那就是让你在乎的人都陪在你身边。”他转过头面对真嗣，笑容依旧。“为什么呢？”

Shinji found himself remaining silent for a moment. He never really thought about why that was all he really wanted; he just knew that was what he wanted. It was just one of those things that instinctively he desired more than anything else. The idea of having someone who cared about him was all he ever sought out for. That was the very reason he began piloting Unit 01 in the first place, so he could obtain his father's affection. After he realized that his father wanted nothing to do with him on an emotional level, then he just filled that void by embracing the affection he found with Asuka, Rei, Misato, Kensuke, and Toji. During the end of the world in his timeline, at that moment in time, he felt as though he had tumbled into the ultimate pit of despair, and it was then that Shinji truly realized how much his friends and loved ones meant to him. "Because I don't want to lose them." Shinji spoke, lowering his head and letting his bangs fall partly over his eyes. "If I lost them, then I wouldn't have anything really. I mean, what's the point of living your life if there is nobody who makes it worthwhile?"  
真嗣发现自己沉默了一会儿。他从未真正思考过为什么那才是他真正想要的；他只知道那是他想要的。这只是那些本能上他比任何东西都更渴望的事情之一。拥有一个关心他的人的想法，是他一直以来所追求的全部。正是这个原因，他开始驾驶初号机，以便获得父亲的关爱。当他意识到父亲在情感层面上不想与他有任何瓜葛后，他便通过拥抱与明日香、绫波、美里、真希、和渡治之间的感情来填补那个空缺。在他的时间线末日之际，那一刻，他感觉自己仿佛跌入了绝望的深渊，正是在那时，真嗣真正意识到他的朋友和所爱之人对他意味着多少。“因为我不想失去他们。”真嗣说道，低下头，让刘海部分遮住了眼睛。“如果我失去了他们，那么我就真的什么都没有了。我是说，如果生活中没有人让它变得有意义，那么活着还有什么意义呢？”

"Some people live only for self gain." Kaworu said.  
“有些人只为自我利益而活。”渚薰说道。

"Everyone is different." He retorted. "Some people are fine with having nobody but themselves, but most people aren't like that." He rose his head and met Kaworu's crimson eyes with his hazel. "It's the bonds that we form with those we care about that make us stronger, really. I mean, if Asuka wasn't there to yell at me and tell me when I was doing something wrong, I wouldn't be the person I am now. Ha, she practically saved my life one time. And I'm always with her as well, showing her that she isn't alone."  
"每个人都是不同的。" 他反驳道。"有些人可以独自一人过得很好，但大多数人并非如此。" 他抬起头，与渚薰深红色的眼睛对视，自己的则是榛色。"正是我们与所关心之人建立的纽带，让我们真正变得强大。我的意思是，如果没有明日香在那里对我大喊大叫，告诉我何时做错了事，我就不会成为现在的我。哈哈，她有一次几乎救了我的命。而我也在她身边，让她知道她并不孤单。"

"But do you think that they feel the same way about you?"  
"但你觉得他们对你也有同样的感受吗？"

"Of course I do!" Shinji found himself quite surprised that his answer came so quickly and with such passion. Kaworu bit down on his upper lip and averted his eyes from Shinji, looking straight forward.  
"当然有！" 真嗣惊讶地发现自己回答得如此迅速且充满激情。渚薰咬了咬上唇，避开了真嗣的目光，直视前方。"

"I see." He murmured. "So are you saying that you think that most Lil-… I mean, most humans are all like this? That they live not just for themselves, but for the sake of others as well?"  
"我明白了。" 他低声说。"所以你是说，你认为大多数人类都是这样吗？他们不仅为自己而活，也为他人而活？"

"I like to think so." He nodded. "Yeah." Nagisa remained silent for a moment before lifting himself up from the bench. "I think I understand, then."  
"我喜欢这么想。" 他点头。"是啊。" 渚沉默了一会儿，然后从长椅上起身。"我想我明白了。"

"Understand what?" Shinji asked, looking at the silver-haired teen with a perplexed expression on his face. "That Lilin truly is a blessed race; they may deserve another chance." He replied, turning back to face Shinji. Shinji found himself frozen in place as he saw Kaworu lower his head down to Shinji's level and begin to close in the distance between their faces, his lips slightly puckered, but his crimson eyes open, staring directly into Ikari's.  
"明白什么？" 真嗣问，看着银发少年，脸上带着困惑的表情。"你是说人类确实是一个受祝福的种族；他们或许值得再给一次机会。" 他回答，转过身面对真嗣。真嗣发现自己僵在原地，看着渚低头到与他平视，开始缩短他们之间的距离，嘴唇微微噘起，但那双深红色的眼睛睁着，直直地盯着碇。

"Wait, Kaworu, stop!" Quickly, Shinji slid out from around Nagisa and stood on his feet, causing for the silver haired boy to give him a slightly puzzled expression. "I'm sorry, Kaworu, but I…" He stopped as he felt his cheeks grow hot, blushing. "You're a good friend Kaworu, but I just don't feel that way about you." Smirking, the fair- skinned boy managed a smile, showing no offense in Shinji's rejection.  
"等等，薰，停下来！" 真嗣迅速从渚身边滑出，站起身来，银发少年的脸上露出一丝困惑。"对不起，薰，但我……" 他停了下来，感觉脸颊发烫，脸红了。"你是个好朋友，薰，但我对你没有那种感觉。" 微笑着，皮肤白皙的少年努力挤出一个微笑，对真嗣的拒绝没有表现出任何不悦。

"I know you don't, Shinji." He spoke, putting his hands down to his sides. "I don't think you ever could, either."  
"我知道你没有，真嗣。" 他说着，将双手放回身体两侧。"我想你永远也不会有那种感觉。"

"What do you…" "你这是什么意思……"

"Goodbye, Shinji." Kaworu stepped backward. Without so much as another word, the silver-haired boy turned around and made his way down the hall towards the elevator, leaving Shinji standing alone in the hall.  
“再见，真嗣。” 渚薰向后退了一步。没有再多说一句话，银发的少年转身沿着走廊向电梯走去，留下真嗣独自站在走廊中。

The blue and white face of Evangelion Unit 00 stared vacantly at Kaworu as he made his way across the catwalk. Each step he took echoed throughout the cages until he finally came to a stop in front  
福音战士零号机那蓝白相间的面孔空洞地凝视着渚薰，他正穿过天桥。每走一步，回声都在笼子里回荡，直到他终于在福音战士前停下。

of the EVA. Letting out a sigh, Kaworu knew that this had to be done. He really didn't want to do this, especially after the talk he had with Shinji. However, it was something he had been postponing for a long time now, and couldn't ignore for any longer. Kaworu and watched as his feet slowly began to lift off of the catwalk as he began floating towards the sleeping Evangelion.  
渚薰叹了口气，他知道这必须完成。他真的不想这么做，尤其是在与真嗣交谈之后。然而，这是他长期以来一直在拖延的事情，不能再忽视了。渚薰看着自己的双脚缓缓离开天桥，开始向沉睡的福音战士飘去。

"Come on, Let's go." Kaworu said, looking directly at the EVA, "Come with me, Adam's alter ego, servant of the Lilin." He stepped forward into the air, his AT-Field supporting his weight. The dark-red lense slits around the Evangelion's eyes began to glow with a brilliant white light. The EVA started to roar; it continued on for another few seconds before beginning to fade away, while Kaworu and Unit 00 were gone, leaving only the sleeping Unit D. A red light began to flash throughout the room and a high-pitched alarm sounded throughout the entire facility. An Angel alert.  
"来吧，我们走。" 渚薰直视着 EVA 说道，"跟我来，亚当的另我，莉莉丝的仆从。" 他向前迈入空中，AT 力场支撑着他的体重。EVA 周围暗红色的镜头缝隙开始发出耀眼的白光。EVA 开始咆哮，持续了几秒钟后逐渐消失，而渚薰和零号机也不见了，只剩下沉睡的 D 型机。房间内红灯闪烁，整个设施响起了尖锐的警报声。天使警报。

"A developing AT-Field has been detected in Central Dogma!" Makoto looked at his terminal, which was flashing red warning signs. "Pattern blue! It's hijacked Unit 00 and descending down to Central Dogma!" Makoto reported, "Not good! It's already breached level four!"  
"在中央教条区检测到正在发展的 AT 力场！" 真嗣看着闪烁着红色警告标志的终端说道，"蓝色模式！它劫持了零号机并正在向中央教条区下降！" 真嗣报告道，"不妙！它已经突破了第四层！"

"Emergency locked down! Close all partitions in Central Dogma!" Fuyutsuki ordered, slamming his fist on the desk. "It'll buy us some time, no matter how little!" 'Rei, it's up to you know,' he thought, 'the last Angel must be defeated.'  
"紧急封锁！关闭中央教条区的所有分区！" 冬月命令道，重重地捶打桌面，"无论如何，这能为我们争取一点时间！" '丽，现在就看你的了，' 他心想，'必须击败最后一个使徒。'

"Where's the pilot of Unit D? Where's Shinji?" Misato shouted, "Send Unit D to intercept the Angel!"  
"D 单位驾驶员在哪里？真嗣呢？" 美里喊道，"派 D 单位去拦截使徒！"

"He's already waiting in the entry plug!" Aoba scanned through the security cameras, "Activating Unit D!"  
"他已经在插入栓里待命了！" 青叶通过监控摄像头查看，"启动 D 单位！"

"Shinji, listen, the Sixth Child, Kaworu Nagisa is an Angel; your order is to eliminate it at all costs!" Although she didn't really need to say that, she still needed to maintain a sense of formality.  
"真嗣，听着，第六适格者，渚薰是使徒；你的命令是不惜一切代价消灭它！" 虽然她并不需要特别强调这一点，但她仍然需要保持一种正式的语气。"

"Roger." Shinji's voice was calm but a little bit unsure. He still had so much he wanted to ask and talk about with Kaworu, and it seemed there wasn't much time left for him.  
“罗杰。”真嗣的声音平静，却带着一丝不确定。他还有太多想问、想与渚讨论的事情，但似乎留给他的时间不多了。

Kaworu and the blue Evangelion began their descent towards the black abyss that awaited them at the bottom of the elevator shaft leading to Terminal Dogma. Even from down here he could still hear the blaring sound of NERV's alarm echoing down the chute. He frowned as he thought about what awaited him at the bottom of this long descent. Once he was one with Adam, the race of Lilin would come to an end, and the creatures that he had started to grow quite fond of would be no more. Perhaps that was why he felt a tinge of warmth in his heart when he heard the blood lusted screams of Unit D's pilot as the purple-crimson Evangelion shot downwards towards him and Unit 00, its progressive knife in hand.  
渚和蓝色的福音开始向电梯井底部通往最终教条区的黑色深渊降落。即便从下方，他仍能听到 NERV 警报的刺耳回声在通道中回荡。他皱起眉头，思考着这段漫长下降的尽头等待着他的会是什么。一旦他与亚当合为一体，人类种族将走向终结，那些他开始颇为喜爱的生物将不复存在。或许正是因此，当他听到 D 型机驾驶员充满嗜血欲望的尖叫声时，心中涌起了一丝暖意，那紫红色的福音手持推进刀，向他和 00 号机疾驰而来。

"Kaworu, wait!" The brown-haired pilot screamed, gritting his teeth as he quickly continued on his approach. "How could you do this to us!" Frowning, Nagisa lowered his head. "Please believe me when I say that I wish it didn't have to come to this, Shinji. However, it is my destiny. All born from Adam are fated to return to Adam."  
"カヲル、待って！" 茶色の髪のパイロットは悲鳴を上げ、歯を食いしばりながら急いで接近を続けた。"どうしてこんなことをしてくれるんだ！" 顔をしかめて、ナギサは頭を下げた。"こんな結末にならなければいいと願っていることを信じてほしい、シンジ。しかし、これが私の運命なのだ。アダムから生まれた者は皆、アダムに帰る運命にある。"

"Liar!" Shinji cried as Unit D's fist slammed into the face of Unit 00, forcing it to topple in the air as it continued falling down the chute. "You aren't bound to anything! You don't have to do anything you don't want to!" The Angel closed his eyes and shook his head. "If only that were true, Shinji. Us Angels are not given the gift of free will like you Lilin are. Unfortunately this is how it must be."  
"嘘つき！" シンジは叫びながら、ユニットDの拳がユニット00の顔面を打ちつけ、空中で転倒させながらシュートを落ち続けた。"何も縛られていないじゃないか！自分のやりたくないことなんて何もしなくていい！" 天使は目を閉じて頭を振った。"それが本当ならいいのだが、シンジ。我々天使には、あなた方リリンのような自由意志という贈り物は与えられていない。残念ながら、こうなるしかないのだ。"

"Kaworu!" Shinji growled, swinging Unit D's giant hand at the person he used to consider his friend in his own timeline. "How about Asuka and me? How about Rei? You know about us, right? We don't need to do this, you don't either!" His statement, including the mention of Asuka, was vague enough to leave everyone on the Command desk dumbfounded except Misato, but Kaworu knew very well what he meant. He increased his AT-Field output, effectively blocking all electromagnetic waves from escaping; this way no one up there  
"卡沃鲁！" 真嗣咆哮着，挥动 D 型机的巨手向曾经视为朋友的他发起攻击。"那明日香和我呢？还有绫波呢？你明明知道我们的，对吧？我们不必这样，你也不必！" 他提到明日香的话语含糊其辞，让指挥台上的众人除了美里外都一头雾水，但卡沃鲁心知肚明。他增强了 AT 力场的输出，有效阻断了所有电磁波的逃逸；这样一来，

would know what they would be talking. "Shinji-kun, the moment I saw you, I knew you possess the power of Angels. From what you said I can assume the Second Child possess it as well. I totally did not anticipate this; I can't recall anything like this happening from all my other lives."  
上方的人就无法知晓他们的对话内容。"真嗣君，从见到你的那一刻起，我就知道你拥有天使的力量。从你的话中我推测，二号机驾驶员也拥有这种力量。我完全没有预料到这一点；在我的所有其他生命中，我从未记得发生过类似的事情。"

Shinji blinked at the mention of 'all my other lives,' "Wha-what do you mean, Kaworu? Are you from another universe?"  
听到'所有其他生命'的说法，真嗣愣住了，"什、什么意思，卡沃鲁？你是来自另一个宇宙吗？"

"Another Universe? No, of course not," Kaworu's eyes narrowed a millimeter, "I guess it would hurt to tell you. The universe we're at is a cyclic universe. From the moment Second Impact started, it entered an endless cycle, from then to the end of Third Impact." Kaworu paused a few seconds, waiting for Shinji to digest the information, "From the little what I can recall from my previous lives, every time the world ended with Instrumentality initiated by you, Ikari Shinji-kun. My recollections are only faint sensations, not clear memories."  
"另一个宇宙？不，当然不是，" 渚薰的眼睛微微眯起，"我想告诉你也无妨。我们所处的宇宙是一个循环宇宙。从第二次冲击开始的那一刻起，它就进入了一个无尽的循环，从那时到第三次冲击的结束。" 渚薰停顿了几秒，等待真嗣消化这些信息，"从我前世能回忆起的零星片段来看，每一次世界都以你，碇真嗣君，发起的人类补完计划结束。我的记忆只是模糊的感觉，不是清晰的记忆。"

Shinji was dumbstruck at Kaworu's words. A cyclic world? What about Asuka and his worlds? Those worlds were separate, that he was sure of. But Kaworu said this universe he was at right now had been going through countless cycles; apparently each time ended with a Third Impact initiated by his counterparts. "I don't understand, Kaworu!"  
真嗣被渚薰的话惊呆了。循环的世界？那明日香和自己的世界呢？那些世界是独立的，这一点他很确定。但渚薰说现在他所处的这个宇宙已经经历了无数次循环；显然每一次都以他的同位体发起的第三次冲击结束。"我不明白，渚薰！"

"I am very curious, Shinji-kun. You and the Second Child were never meant to possess Angelic powers." Kaworu's grin faded, "at least in _this_ universe."  
"我很好奇，真嗣君。你和第二适格者本不该拥有使徒的力量。" 渚薰的笑容消失了，"至少在这个宇宙中。"

Shinji felt a sense of dread at Kaworu's emphasis on 'this universe'. He briefly assessed his situation; there wouldn't be any loss if he tells him about his true origin, in fact he may get more answers this way. "Kaworu, I-I'm actually from a parallel universe."  
真嗣对卡罗尔强调'这个宇宙'感到一阵不安。他简要评估了自己的处境；即使告诉他自己的真实来历也不会有什么损失，事实上，这样他可能会得到更多答案。“卡罗尔，我——我其实来自一个平行宇宙。”

Kaworu's expression turned into a frown, which had never happened once in his countless lives. "Shinji-kun, do you know the reason this universe had been in a cycle?" Hearing no replies from Shinji who was still fighting Unit 00, he continued, "Every time after Third  
卡罗尔的表情变成了皱眉，这在他的无数次生命中从未发生过。“真嗣君，你知道这个宇宙为何会陷入循环吗？”看到仍在与零号机战斗的真嗣没有回应，他继续说道，“每次在第三次冲击之后，你会拒绝现实；那时你拥有神的力量。于是世界听从了你的愿望，重置了。当然，你不会保留任何记忆。重启的世界有时会经历稍微不同的轨迹，但每一个都以第三次冲击结束。然后你会再次拒绝它，循环往复。”

Impact, you would reject the reality; at that time you had the power of Gods. Thus the world listened to your wish and reset. You wouldn't hold any memories, of course. The restarted worlds would sometimes experience a slightly different path, but every one of them ended with Third Impact. Then you would reject it again, and the cycle went on."  
冲击之后，你会拒绝现实；那时你拥有神的力量。于是世界听从了你的愿望，重置了。当然，你不会保留任何记忆。重启的世界有时会经历稍微不同的轨迹，但每一个都以第三次冲击结束。然后你会再次拒绝它，循环往复。

"Wha-what?" Now Shinji was really dumbfounded, "What about the universe I came from, then?"  
"什-什么？" 现在真嗣真的愣住了，"那我来自的那个宇宙呢？"

"I do not know how did you come here, nor I know what would happen with your universe. My guess will be you wished for something different during Instrumentality," Kaworu explained, "with Lilith, Adam, and the entire human race, the power could breach the barrier between universes."  
"我不知道你是怎么来到这里的，也不知道你的宇宙会发生什么。我猜想，你在执行仪式时可能许了不同的愿望，" 渚薰解释道，"借助莉莉丝、亚当以及整个人类的力量，这种力量能够突破宇宙间的屏障。"

"However, the flow of time was one thing irresistible, even with the power of Adam and Lilith combined. They only could reset the world, but time went on."  
"然而，时间之流是不可抗拒的，即使亚当和莉莉丝的力量结合也无法改变。他们只能重置世界，但时间依旧流逝。"

"Every cycle starts after Second Impact, and ends with Third Impact."  
“每个循环始于第二次冲击，终于第三次冲击。”

"Who knows how long had passed since the first cycle? One thousand, one hundred thousand, even one million years? The world resets, but the universe wouldn't stop moving forward. The time the universe ends, then it will be the end of everything, including Adam and Lilith."  
“谁知道第一个循环过去多久了？一千年，十万年，甚至一百万年？世界重置，但宇宙不会停止前行。当宇宙终结之时，一切都将结束，包括亚当和莉莉丝。”

"Meanwhile, the human race could only stay in this endless cycle and suffer. My reunion with Adam would put an end to this meaningless suffering, Shinji-kun." Kaworu finished his speech, smiling at Shinji.  
“与此同时，人类只能困在这无尽的循环中受苦。我与亚当的重逢将终结这无意义的苦难，真嗣君。”渚薰说完，微笑着看向真嗣。

Shinji was frozen in place at his words. He had no way of knowing whether they were truthful or not; he didn't want to believe him, either. It would put a ton of weight on anyone who had just learned  
听到他的话，真嗣僵在原地。他无法判断这些话是真是假；他也不愿意相信。对于一个刚刚得知自己无数次终结世界的人来说，这无疑是个沉重的打击。"我……我无数次终结了世界？

that they had ended the world countless times. "Y-you are joking, right, Kaworu? I… I ended the world countless times?"  
“你在开玩笑吧，薰？我……我无数次终结了世界？”

"Indeed, Shinji-kun. I can see your heart is pure, and I wish no pain to you." Kaworu said, "Let me end this, so none of you could feel any more pain."  
“确实如此，真嗣君。我能看出你的心灵纯洁，我不愿让你承受痛苦。”薰说道，“让我来结束这一切，这样你们就不会再感到痛苦了。”

With his speech stopping, Kaworu and both EVA units finally breached the final layer of armor, and they all fell to the ground, raising clouds of dust. Kaworu took a final look at the still-fighting Unit D and Unit 00, then turned around and floated towards his destiny.  
随着话语戛然而止，渚薰和两台 EVA 终于突破了最后一层装甲，一同坠落地面，扬起阵阵尘土。渚薰最后看了一眼仍在战斗的 D 型机和 00 号机，随即转身，飘向他的宿命。

Up in the Command Center, all hands were on deck and watching from the security cameras as Unit D combated against Kaworu and the rogue Unit 00, save for and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki. Misato's grip on the back of Hyuga's chair tightened as she watched them fall closer and closer to the depths of Terminal Dogma. It would be only a matter of minutes until they reached it, at which point nothing would stand between Kaworu and the bulbous humanoid that was Lilith. Misato knew it was not Adam down there, but she didn't know what would happen with an Angel-Lilith fusion. She was not going to take the risk. "If the Angel reaches Terminal Dogma, I want you to activate the self-destruct system." The lavender-haired woman gulped as she watched the three dots on the map hovering in front of them grow closer and closer to the bottom. "It'd be better for us to die than for all of humanity to be annihilated."  
指挥中心内，全员严阵以待，通过监控摄像头注视着 D 型机与渚薰及叛变的 00 号机交战，唯有副指挥官冬月不在场。看着他们一步步逼近最终教条区的深渊，美里紧握着日向椅背的手越发用力。不出几分钟，他们便会抵达那里，届时，渚薰与莉莉丝之间将再无阻碍。美里清楚下方并非亚当，但她也不知天使与莉莉丝融合会发生什么。她不愿冒险。“如果天使抵达最终教条区，立即启动自毁系统。”紫发女子紧盯着眼前地图上逐渐逼近底部的三个光点，咽了口唾沫。“与其让人类灭绝，不如我们自己了断。”

"I understand." Hyuga replied, taking in a deep breath as he bit down on his lower lip. "I mean, dying next to you wouldn't be so bad, right?" The engineer forced a smile, trying to retain a strong front, but it was quite clear that he was having trouble holding it all together. With a warm smile, Misato placed a hand on Hyuga's shoulder. "Thanks Hyuga."  
"我明白。" 日向回答道，深吸一口气，咬紧了下唇。"我是说，能和你一起死去也不算太糟，对吧？" 工程师强颜欢笑，试图保持坚强的外表，但很明显，他正努力维持这一切。米萨托带着温暖的微笑，将手放在日向的肩膀上。"谢谢你，日向。"

Back in the depths of NERV Headquarters, the fight raged on between the EVAs. Though Unit D had its enemy flanked, it wasn't appearing to do them any good. Unit 00's reaction time was just so  
在 NERV 总部的深处，EVA 之间的战斗愈演愈烈。尽管 D 型机已经包围了敌人，但这似乎并没有带来任何好处。00 型 EVA 的反应速度之快，

inhumanly fast and precise that any opening it presented itself with was quickly covered before a blow could be delivered.  
精准到非人的程度，以至于它所展现的任何破绽都能迅速被弥补，使得任何攻击都无法得手。

Kaworu exhaled as the fight continued. He could practically feel the presence of his kin now. Taking in a deep breath, the Angel put forth the strongest AT-Field he could possibly muster, illuminating the whole interior of Terminal Dogma with a brilliant light. After the initial  
战斗持续着，渚薰缓缓呼气。他几乎能感受到同类的存在。深吸一口气，这位天使释放出他所能凝聚的最强 AT 力场，将 Terminal Dogma 的内部照得一片通明。在最初的

flash, darkness overcame everything, save for the two Evangelions  
闪光过后，除了他身后的两台 EVA 还在战斗外，一切都陷入了黑暗。

that fought behind him.

"Major Katsuragi!" Hyuga jumped up from his seat as the lights inside of the Command Center cut off, leaving them in almost complete darkness. "The Angel has just generated the strongest AT- Field I've ever seen! It's completely blocking out everything! Light, radar, everything!"  
“葛城少校！”日向从座位上跳了起来，指挥中心内的灯光突然熄灭，使他们陷入几乎完全的黑暗。“使徒刚刚生成了我所见过的最强的 AT 力场！它完全屏蔽了一切！光线、雷达，所有的一切！”

"Damn it!" Misato stomped her boot onto the ground, gritting her teeth. "Just blow the damn thing! There's nothing we can do now!"  
“该死！”美里用力跺了跺脚，咬紧牙关。“直接炸了那东西！我们现在无计可施了！”

"I can't!" The technician replied frantically. "Everything is shut down! I think the AT-Field caused some sort of pseudo EMP blast!" Feeling her heart come to a stop, Misato felt all of the breath in her lungs leave her body in a gasp. "Then that means it's all up to Shinji now.  
“我做不到！”技术员慌乱地回答。“所有系统都关闭了！我觉得 AT 力场引发了某种伪 EMP 爆炸！”美里感到心脏仿佛停止了跳动，她倒吸了一口气，所有的气息从肺中呼出。“那就意味着现在全靠真嗣了。”

There's nothing we can do."  
我们无能为力。

Kaworu could feel the radiation of the presence of an Angel, the presence of his kin. He was growing very close.  
渚薰能感受到使徒的存在，那种同类的气息。他正越来越接近。

Meanwhile, Unit D finally disabled Unit 00 with a fatal blow delivered to its head, and sprinted through Terminal Dogma, following Kaworu. With each step that he took, he could feel the Angel raising an AT- Field to hinder his progress. However each one was ripped through like paper; he didn't understand what had caused his AT-Field to decrease in strength, but he didn't care about it that time.  
与此同时，D 型机终于以致命一击摧毁了 00 号机，并疾速穿过中央教条区，紧随渚薰。每迈出一步，他都能感觉到使徒正在升起 AT 力场以阻碍他的前进。然而每一个力场都像纸一样被撕裂；他不明白自己的 AT 力场为何会减弱，但那一刻他并不在意。

"Kaworu, stop!" Shinji called out to the silver-haired boy as he floated across the large chamber, venturing farther into the darkness. "I'm  
"“薰，停下来！”真嗣对着漂浮在大厅中的银发少年喊道，他正向着更深的黑暗中探索。“我……”

sorry, Shinji. But you know that I can't do that." He replied, raising  
“对不起，真嗣。但你知道我不能那样做。”他回答道，举起

another AT-Field between him and Unit D. With a hard punch, the purple mech tore through it and continued its progress towards the Angel. Frowning, Kaworu continued on, following Adam's call, feeling it radiating through his body.  
另一道 AT 力场挡在自己和 D 型机之间。紫色机体一记重拳击穿了它，继续向使徒逼近。薰皱着眉头继续前行，追随着亚当的召唤，感受着那股力量在他体内涌动。

He finally came right in front of the giant white humanoid; looking at its masked face, Kaworu said, "Adam, our mother. Must all born from Adam return to Adam? Even at the cost of destroying humanity?" His eyes narrowed an inch when he noticed something was wrong, "No, this is not Adam! This is… Lilith?" An expression of shock and comprehension washed over his face, "I see, so that's what this is about, Lilin." Suddenly it all came together as he gazed at the giant figure mounted to the blood red cross. This entire time he thought he had been the one manipulating SEELE, when it was actually SEELE who had been manipulating him. They knew that he would expose himself as the final Angel and venture forth to become one with Adam, only to discover that it was not Adam who awaited him. They had used him for their science experiment and repaid him by sending him into a deathtrap.  
他终于站在了那巨大的白色人形生物面前；望着它那戴着面具的脸，渚薰说道，“亚当，我们的母亲。是否所有由亚当所生之物都必须回归亚当？即便这要以毁灭人类为代价？”当他察觉到有些不对劲时，眼神微微一缩，“不，这不是亚当！这是……莉莉丝？”震惊与领悟的表情掠过他的脸庞，“我明白了，原来如此，莉莉丝的后裔。”突然间一切变得清晰，他凝视着被固定在血红色十字架上的巨型身影。一直以来，他以为是自己操纵着 SEELE，却未曾想是 SEELE 在操纵他。他们知道他会暴露自己作为最后的使徒，并试图与亚当合为一体，结果却发现等待他的并非亚当。他们利用他进行科学实验，并以送他进入死亡陷阱作为回报。

Shinji ripped through the final layer of AT-Field and rushed to the floating Angel, grabbing him firmly in his hands.  
真嗣撕破了 AT 力场的最后一层，冲向悬浮的使徒，紧紧抓住了他。

"Thank you, Shinji-kun." Kaworu smiled, "I wanted you to defeat Unit 00." In a way he found this to be a relief. He had failed, and by failing, that meant that the human race as a whole would continue to survive. However, that still meant that he had to face his end before such a thing could be achieved, added that the human race would go on for another cycle. He didn't know why he couldn't remember the crucial fact that it was Lilith inside Terminal Dogma; maybe it had something to do with quantum mechanics; because the world was still in a cycle, that means he HAD to NOT know about it; otherwise the world would have already ended.  
"谢谢你，真嗣君。" 渚薰微笑着，"我希望你能击败零号机。" 某种程度上，他觉得这是一种解脱。他失败了，而失败意味着人类整体将继续生存。然而，这仍然意味着他必须在实现这一目标之前面对自己的终结，再加上人类将进入下一个循环。他不明白为什么记不起关键事实——在最终教条区的是莉莉丝；也许这与量子力学有关；因为世界仍处于循环中，这意味着他必须不知道这一点；否则世界早已终结。

Kaworu could only hope Shinji will make the right decision this time; this Shinji was from another universe, after all. Maybe his presence could bring an end to this meaningless cycle.  
渚薰只能寄希望于真嗣这次能做出正确的决定；毕竟这个真嗣来自另一个宇宙。也许他的存在能终结这个无意义的循环。

"Why, Kaworu, why?" Shinji asked, his hands gritting tightly around the control yokes.  
"为什么，渚薰，为什么？" 真嗣问道，双手紧握着操纵杆。

"The truth is that I don't wish for any harm to come to you. You have shown me a side of Lilin that I didn't even know existed. A beautiful, tender side, and because of that, I feel empathy for you. I think… that I love you, Shinji-kun. Is this what love is about?"  
"事实是我并不希望你受到任何伤害。你向我展示了莉莉丝我不曾知晓的一面。一个美丽、温柔的侧面，正因为如此，我对你产生了同情。我想……我爱上了你，真嗣君。这就是爱的感觉吗？"

"B..but I…" Shinji could mutter a meaningful sentence; although he didn't 'love' Kaworu since his 'love' had been Asuka's, he still found it made things much more complex.  
"但……我……" 真嗣勉强能说出一句有意义的话；虽然他对渚薰没有爱意，因为他心中的爱早已属于明日香，但他仍觉得情况变得更加复杂。

"Do it, Shinji." Kaworu spoke. "You know what you have to do. If you wish for humanity to survive, then you must kill me."  
"动手吧，真嗣。" 渚薰说道。"你知道你必须做什么。如果你想让人类生存下去，那么你必须杀了我。"

Shinji felt his heart begin to race, and his body grew cold. "Kaworu…" The silver-haired boy remained silent as he looked up at the face of Unit 01, a warm smile spread across his face. There was no fear, no anger, no sadness, none of those emotions Shinji expected to see. What he did see though, was the look of hope.  
真嗣感到心跳加速，身体变得冰冷。“薰……”银发少年依旧沉默，抬头凝视着初号机的面庞，脸上洋溢着温暖的微笑。没有恐惧，没有愤怒，没有悲伤，这些真嗣预期中的情绪一个也没有。但他确实看到了希望的神情。

Hope that perhaps through his own death, Kaworu could save humanity as a whole.  
希望或许通过自己的死亡，薰能够拯救整个人类。

"Shinji-kun, now I can't bring this world to salvation, the responsibility lies on your shoulders." Kaworu said, "I can only hope you make the right choice this time, Shinji-kun."  
“真嗣君，现在我无法拯救这个世界，责任落在了你的肩上。”薰说道，“我只希望这次你能做出正确的选择，真嗣君。”

Shinji's heart was beating so fast that it felt like a freight train was about to burst out of his chest. He didn't want to do it, but he knew that he had to. Closing his eyes, Shinji thought about all of those whose lives would end if he couldn't do this, if he couldn't go through with killing Kaworu. Asuka, Rei, Misato, Kensuke, Hikari, Hyuga, Maya, Aoba, Ritsuko, Fuyutsuki, his own father… All of these lives would come to an end, if he didn't end this right here and right now.  
真嗣的心跳得如此之快，仿佛一列货运火车即将从他的胸膛中冲出。他并不想这么做，但他知道他必须这么做。闭上眼睛，真嗣想到了那些如果他做不到，如果他不能继续杀死薰的话，生命将会结束的人。明日香、丽、美里、剑介、光、冬二、玛雅、青叶、律子、副司令、他自己的父亲……如果他不能在这里和现在结束这一切，所有这些生命都将走到尽头。

Although he knew the white giant was Lilith, not Adam, and it was probably one of the main reasons Kaworu stopped attacking, he also knew Kaworu was truthful about his feeling towards him, or rather,  
尽管他知道那个白色巨人是莉莉丝，不是亚当，这可能是薰停止攻击的主要原因之一，但他也知道薰对他，或者说，对人类的感情是真诚的。

mankind. 'I'll have to make the right choice,' Shinji thought, 'the right choice…'  
人类。'我必须做出正确的选择，'真嗣想，'正确的选择……'

"I'm sorry, Kaworu." Then with just the slightest movement of his hand, it was over.  
“对不起，薰。”随后，仅以手指微动，一切便结束了。

The cool breeze gently blew across Shinji's arms while he stood on the edge of the balcony of his apartment, overlooking the night sky above him. The stars and moonlight shone down and illuminated onto him as his conversations with Kaworu played over and over again in his head.  
凉风轻拂过真嗣的臂膀，他站在公寓阳台的边缘，俯瞰着头顶的夜空。星光与月光洒落，照亮了他，而与薰的对话在他脑海中一遍遍回放。

Letting out an exhale, Shinji could hear the sound of shoes brushing against the floor behind him, but paid no mind as the sound grew nearer. The form of a redheaded girl stood next to him, leaning onto his body for warmth. "Misato and Rei's worried about you." Asuka spoke. "And I'm worried about you too."  
真嗣轻叹一声，听见身后鞋底摩擦地板的声音，但并未在意，直到声音越来越近。一位红发女孩站在他身旁，倚靠着他的身体取暖。“美里和丽都很担心你。”明日香说道，“我也很担心你。”

"Of course you are, darling," Shinji said with a warm smile, keeping his gaze focused on the sky above him.  
"当然你是，亲爱的，" 真嗣带着温暖的微笑说，目光始终聚焦在他头顶的天空上。

"Look, you did what you had to. It was either Kaworu or the world. You made the right decision by killing him. I know that probably doesn't make you feel any better, but that's all there is to it."  
"看，你做了你必须做的。要么是薰，要么是世界。你杀了他，做出了正确的决定。我知道这可能不会让你感觉好些，但事实就是如此。"

"It's so easy for you to say that." Shinji murmured, "It's so easy to say that when you didn't have to look into his eyes and watch him die."  
"你说得倒轻松。" 真嗣低声说，"当你不必看着他的眼睛，亲眼目睹他死去时，说这话当然容易。"

"You're right Shinji. It is that easy for me. It is that easy for me to be so black and white about it. Believe me, if I could go back in time and kill him in your place, I would! It should've been me that killed Kaworu, not you! I can live with taking somebody else's life. I can carry that burden, but the fact is we can't change what's already happened. So you just have to learn to accept it, or else it'll eat you away." Taking a breath, Asuka turned her eyes back up to the stars. "Sure, it's not the way we wanted for things to go, but it's just the way  
"你说得对，真嗣。对我来说就是这么简单。我可以如此黑白分明地看待这件事。相信我，如果我能回到过去，替你杀了他，我一定会这么做！本该是我杀了渚薰，而不是你！我可以承受夺取他人生命的重担。我可以背负那个负担，但事实是我们无法改变已经发生的事。所以你只能学会接受，否则它会慢慢吞噬你。" 深吸一口气，明日香再次抬头望向星空。"当然，这不是我们希望事情发展的方式，但这就是现实

they are. You have to just accept them and move on." Asuka pulled Shinji into a loose embrace, sharing the body warmth while not applying too much pressure on his already stressed mentality.  
"它们就是这样。你必须接受它们并继续前进。" 明日香轻轻地将真嗣拥入怀中，分享着体温，同时没有给他已经紧张的内心增加太多压力。

"I'll wait for you in our room once you've done thinking, alright?" With that being said, Asuka turned around and walked to the door.  
"你思考完之后，我在我们的房间等你，好吗？" 说完这话，明日香转身走向门口。

"Asuka," He muttered, hearing her footsteps draw farther and farther away from him, each step becoming quieter than the last. "Wait." The redhead stopped mid-stride, and partially turned her body to face Shinji.  
"明日香，" 他喃喃道，听着她的脚步声越来越远，每一步都比上一步更轻。"等等。" 红发女孩在半空中停下脚步，身体微微转向真嗣。

"What, Liebling?"

"What do you think Kaworu would want?" Shinji asked, "he told me about… a lot of disturbing things. Things I might have done. And he told me to make the right choice this time. I-I just don't know what to do anymore."  
"你觉得薰会希望什么？" 真嗣问道，"他告诉了我……很多令人不安的事情。我可能做过的事情。他还告诉我这次要做出正确的选择。我……我真的不知道该怎么办了。

The redhead inhaled, and then slowly exhaled. Her sapphire eyes remained unmoved from Shinji's figure as she contemplated the statement. "We'll… talk about it later, after… bed, sounds good to you?" The Second Child smiled encouragingly, "Don't keep me waiting, Baka."  
红发女孩深吸一口气，然后缓缓呼出。她那蓝宝石般的眼睛始终未从真嗣身上移开，她沉思着这句话。"我们……晚点再谈，在……睡觉之后，你觉得怎么样？" 第二适格者鼓励地笑了笑，"别让我等太久，笨蛋。

The hormonal rush after hearing the words temporarily suppressed all the self-loathing and chaotic thoughts; Shinji smiled shyly with a slight blush to his face, "I'm coming, Asuka."  
听到这些话后，荷尔蒙的冲动暂时压制了所有的自我厌恶和混乱思绪；真嗣羞涩地微笑着，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，“我来了，明日香。”

AN: IMPORTANT MUST READ  
作者注：重要必读

So yes, what I meant by Kaworu's other lives were his experiences in this particular universe, not other parallel universes. This universe, just like Kaworu said, was a cyclic world. Countless cycles had been started and ended. What will happen with this cyclic universe? Why did Lilith send Shinji and Asuka to this universe? We'll get our answers in the next few chapters.  
是的，我所说的渚薰的其他生命是指他在这一特定宇宙中的经历，而非其他平行宇宙。正如渚薰所说，这个宇宙是一个循环往复的世界。无数的循环已经开始并结束。这个循环宇宙将会发生什么？为什么莉莉丝将真嗣和明日香送入这个宇宙？我们将在接下来的几章中找到答案。

In the original series, during the last Angel fight Rei was also down in

### Chapter 16: This is not the End

AN: We are almost at the end of the journey!  
作者注：我们的旅程已接近尾声！

I do not own Evangelion.  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

Chapter 16 : T his is not the End  
第十六章：这不是终点

The Command Center of NERV Headquarters remained alive and active. The entire facility had remained on a first-level alert ever since the final Angel had been destroyed, though they had no idea why. There were no more Angels. This was peacetime, technically. At least that's what the three bridge bunnies wanted to believe.  
NERV 总部的指挥中心依旧生机勃勃，充满活力。自从最后一个使徒被消灭以来，整个设施一直处于一级警戒状态，尽管他们并不知道为什么。再也没有使徒了。从技术上讲，这是和平时期。至少这是三位桥兔们想要相信的。

"So what do you think they'll do with us now?" Maya asked, sitting back in her chair while looking over to Hyuga and Aoba. "With all of the Angels dead, what more is there for us to do?"  
“那你们觉得他们现在会怎么处置我们？”摩耶问道，她靠在椅背上，目光转向日向和青叶，“既然所有的使徒都死了，我们还有什么可做的呢？”

"If I had to guess, I figure they're probably going to disband NERV before too long." Aoba replied, gazing down at the third level command deck below which remained empty and void of any personnel. "I don't even want to think about what they'll do with us, though."  
"如果非要猜的话，我想他们可能不久就会解散 NERV。" 青叶回答道，目光向下凝视着空无一人的第三层指挥甲板。"我甚至不想去想他们会怎么处置我们。"

"You're being paranoid." Hyuga sighed, adjusting his glasses. "We'll probably end up just like everyone else who gets involved in decommissioned military projects."  
"你这是多虑了。" 日向叹了口气，调整了一下眼镜。"我们大概会像所有参与过退役军事项目的人一样。"

"And what's that supposed to mean?" Maya inquired, turning in her chair towards Hyuga. "We'll be released from duty and end up taking some crappy government job to pay the rent." Aoba and Maya managed a forced chuckle at the comment. "At least we won't have to worry about the end of the world, right?" Aoba smirked.  
"那是什么意思？" 真希波转向日向问道。"我们会解除职务，然后为了付房租去做些糟糕的政府工作。" 青叶和真希波对这个说法勉强笑了笑。"至少我们不必担心世界末日了，对吧？" 青叶微微一笑。

"Yeah." Hyuga nodded, looking down at the floor as the room started to fall into silence. All three of them let out a sigh, wondering what would actually become of them now. All three of them had practically  
“嗯。”日向点了点头，目光低垂看着地板，房间里开始陷入沉默。三人不约而同地叹了口气，不知道自己将何去何从。他们几乎将一生都奉献给了 NERV，除了 E 计划外，几乎没有其他领域的专业技能。更糟糕的是，他们是技术人员；与理论派的赤木博士不同，他们除了监控 EVA 之外，几乎毫无用处。

dedicated their lives to NERV. They had little expertise outside of Project E. What's worse, they were technicians; unlike Dr. Akagi, who was more on the theoretics side, they had basically no use other than monitoring the EVAs.  
“我希望赤木博士在这里。”伊吹边嚼着饼干边说道，“她总是知道该怎么做。”

"I wish Dr. Akagi was here." Maya let out, chewing the cookies. "She always knows what to do."  
“我希望赤木博士在这里。”伊吹边嚼着饼干边说道，“她总是知道该怎么做。”

SEELE 01: "The scenario indeed had made several undesirable diversions; however, the end result is unproblematic. We now have both Lilith and the Lance of Longinus available, with the help of the EVA series, Instrumentality shall begin at any moment."  
SEELE 01: “计划确实出现了几次不理想的偏差；然而，最终结果并无大碍。现在我们同时拥有了莉莉丝和朗基努斯之枪，借助 EVA 系列的力量，人类补完计划随时可以启动。”

SEELE 03: "Are you sure about that, Keel? Gendo is missing. We don't know where Adam is yet."  
SEELE 03: “你确定吗，基尔？碇源堂失踪了。我们还不知道亚当在哪里。”

SEELE 05: "We have sufficient evidence that Gendo will betray us at the last moment. Without him, there's one less obstacle we need to deal with."  
SEELE 05: “我们有充分证据表明碇源堂会在最后一刻背叛我们。没有他，我们少了一个需要对付的障碍。”

SEELE 04: "Rei seems to be not loyal to us anymore as well. This could make things more complicated."  
SEELE 04: "零似乎也不再忠诚于我们了。这可能会让事情变得更加复杂。"

SEELE 08: "The Second Child should be dead, as Unit 02 self- destructed. Unit 00 was badly damaged during the battle against the seventeenth Angel. There's only Unit D available for NERV at the moment."  
SEELE 08: "二号适格者应该已经死了，因为二号机自行销毁了。零号机在与第十七使徒的战斗中严重受损。目前 NERV 只有 D 型机可用。"

SEELE 11: "We should kill the pilots at first. The Children only exist as potential threats."  
SEELE 11: "我们应该先除掉那些驾驶员。孩子们只是潜在的威胁。"

SEELE 01: "Correct. Commence the extermination of the pilots."  
SEELE 01: "正确。开始清除驾驶员。"

"Cyclic universe?" Asuka narrowed her eyes, "tell me you're serious."  
"循环宇宙？" 明日香眯起眼睛，"告诉我你是认真的。"

"There's no point of joking about something like this," Shinji retorted, "at least it's what Kaworu said. I find it hard to believe, either."  
"开这种玩笑毫无意义，" 真嗣反驳道，"至少这是渚说的。我也很难相信。"

"This is an intriguing idea that actually happens," Rei stated, "he was not wrong. With the power of Adam and Lilith combined, the world could reset."  
"这是一个引人入胜的想法，实际上确实会发生，" 丽说道，"他没错。亚当和莉莉丝的力量结合，世界可以重置。"

Shinji looked like he had something on his mind, quickly slumping down, and his face became clouded. Asuka didn't even need to think to know what he was sulking on. "Hey, idiot. I know what you're thinking. It's not your fault. It's not you you. Different interactions with people around us make us different people. Yes, the previous Shinji's may have your name and look like you, but they are not you. You don't need to feel guilty about something they had done; instead, you need to make sure this time you'll make the right choice!"  
真嗣看起来心事重重，迅速垂下头，脸上布满阴云。明日香甚至不需要思考就知道他在烦恼什么。"嘿，傻瓜。我知道你在想什么。这不是你的错。你不是他们。与周围人的不同互动让我们成为不同的人。是的，以前的那些真嗣可能有你的名字，看起来像你，但他们不是你。你不需要为他们做过的事情感到内疚；相反，你需要确保这次做出正确的选择！"

"Asuka's right, Shin-chan." Misato sighed, "I know it sounds weird that the fate of the world is in the hands of some fourteen-year-old boy, but we don't have any choice, do we?"  
"明日香说得对，真酱。" 美里叹了口气，"我知道这听起来很奇怪，世界的命运掌握在一个十四岁男孩的手中，但我们别无选择，不是吗？"

Shinji seemed to cheer up a little, "Thanks. I think I'll just destroy all MP EVAs, then Third Impact won't even start, right?"  
真嗣似乎振作了一些，“谢谢。我想我会摧毁所有 MP EVA，这样第三次冲击就不会发生了，对吧？”

"The Lance of Longinus is still at Lilith's place. Technically it could still happen." Rei replied, suddenly her eyes widened as she remembered an important detail, "Where is Adam?"  
“朗基努斯之枪还在莉莉丝那里。理论上它仍有可能引发。”绫波回答道，突然她的眼睛睁大了，想起了重要细节，“亚当在哪里？”

Shinji and Asuka looked around, finding Rei and Misato looking at them expectantly. "Rei… were you asking me?" Rei nodded, "and also Asuka."  
真嗣和明日香环顾四周，发现绫波和美里正期待地看着他们。“绫波……你在问我吗？”绫波点头，“还有明日香。”

"I… don't know?" Shinji was surprised that there was actually something he didn't know; it wasn't his fault since he had no way of knowing Adam was planted in his father's hand. Turning his eyes to Asuka, who just shook her head and shrugged.  
"我…不知道？" 真嗣惊讶于竟然有他不知道的事情；这并非他的错，因为他无从得知亚当被植入他父亲手中。他将目光转向明日香，她只是摇了摇头，耸了耸肩。

Rei's body tensed up, "This is very serious. We need to destroy Adam, as well as all the EVAs, including Unit 00. They were made from Adam, and once they awaken, they could start an Impact-level event." She turned to look at Asuka, "Asuka, where did you drop Gendo?"  
绫波的身体紧绷起来，"这非常严重。我们需要摧毁亚当，以及所有 EVA，包括零号机。它们都是由亚当制造的，一旦它们觉醒，可能会引发冲击级的事件。"她转向看着明日香，"明日香，你把碇司令扔到哪里了？"

"I dropped him into the tube where they used to put you in," Asuka answered, "you know the one in Central Dogma."  
"我把他扔进了那个曾经用来安置你的管道里，"明日香回答，"你知道的，在中央教条区的那一个。"

"Oh shit." Misato cursed, "that's not good."  
"哦，该死。" 美里咒骂道，"这可不妙。"

"What? What's wrong? I guess he could live happily inside the LCL…"  
"什么？怎么了？我猜他可以在 LCL 里幸福地生活…"

"There is no need to worry," Rei said calmly, "The tank and the tube were separated. Destroying my clones in the tank should have no effect on what's inside the tube; in fact, it was a safety measure installed by Dr. Akagi."  
"无需担心，" 绫波冷静地说，"坦克和管道已经分离。摧毁坦克中的克隆体应该不会影响到管道内的东西；实际上，这是赤木博士安装的安全措施。"

Misato let out an exhale of relief, "Thank God… but it's still creepy to know when Rits destroyed the clones, he was right there. Maybe he heard our conversation…"  
美里松了一口气，“谢天谢地……但知道当 Rits 摧毁克隆体时，他就在那里，还是有点毛骨悚然。也许他听到了我们的对话……”

BOOM

A loud explosion cut her off; a huge hole appeared on the wall, clouds of dust and debris blurred their visions. The huge noise caused temporary concussions to the occupants of the room; while they were recovering from dizziness, a group of soldiers rushed into the apartment with MP5 submachine guns holding in their hands.  
一声巨响打断了她的话；墙上出现了一个大洞，尘土和碎片模糊了他们的视线。巨大的噪音使房间里的人暂时失聪；当他们从眩晕中恢复过来时，一群士兵手持 MP5 冲锋枪冲进了公寓。

Asuka regained her composure the first, but her brain was still processing all the information. One of the soldiers took out a walkie- talkie and spoke, "Target located. Requesting permission to engage."  
明日香第一个恢复镇定，但她的头脑仍在处理所有信息。其中一名士兵拿出对讲机说道，“目标已定位。请求开火许可。”

_"Affirmative. Fire at will."  
"收到。自由开火。"_

"Roger," the soldier said, pointing his gun at Asuka, while gesturing the others to aim at the others, "Sorry, kid. Nothing personal."  
"明白，" 士兵说道，将枪口对准了明日香，同时示意其他人瞄准其他人，"抱歉，孩子。这无关个人。"

The muzzles flashed and bullets burst out. Asuka instinctively extended her AT-Field, effectively blocking the rain of metals. The soldiers were dumbstruck as they saw an orange octangular light appeared in front of them, and their bullets were all deflected to elsewhere.  
枪口闪烁，子弹喷涌而出。明日香本能地展开了 AT 力场，有效地挡住了金属雨。士兵们目瞪口呆地看着眼前出现的橙色八角形光芒，他们的子弹全都被弹向了别处。

"Wha-" “什——”

"Sorry, nothing personal." Asuka said with a venomous glare, pushing her AT-Field forward, crashing against the group of soldiers. They were instantly shoveled away and flew backward, some of them fell off the balcony. Asuka couldn't care more about their lives; after all, it was a life-death situation.  
“抱歉，无意针对。”明日香带着毒辣的目光说道，将她的 AT 力场向前推进，猛烈撞击着士兵群。他们瞬间被铲飞，向后倒去，有些人甚至从阳台上跌落。明日香无暇顾及他们的生死；毕竟，这是生死攸关的时刻。

Shinji, Rei, and Misato also recovered from their concussions. Not wasting her years of professional military training, Misato pulled out her pistol and aimed at the assassins who were still trying to get up. Without hesitation, she emptied her magazine, sending several soldiers straight to God.  
与此同时，真嗣、绫波和美里也从脑震荡中恢复过来。美里没有浪费她多年的专业军事训练，迅速拔出手枪，瞄准那些仍在试图站起的刺客。毫不犹豫地，她清空了弹匣，将几名士兵直接送上了天堂。

Shinji, on the other hand, was neither mentally prepared for the attack nor killing other people; he simply froze in place, mouth agape. Rei concentrated on sensing the human's AT-Fields, trying to see if there were more of the soldiers out there.  
而真嗣则完全没有为这场袭击或杀人做好心理准备；他只是呆立在原地，嘴巴大张。绫波则专注于感知人类的 AT 力场，试图探查是否还有更多士兵潜伏在外。

"This… didn't happen back then," Asuka murmured, looking at the bodies on the floor.  
"那时候…并没有发生这种事，" 明日香喃喃自语，目光落在地板上的尸体上。

"We should go to NERV Headquarters immediately." Rei spoke, "Shinji, Asuka, you need to get inside your EVA."  
"我们应该立即前往 NERV 总部。" 绫波说，"真嗣，明日香，你们需要进入 EVA。"

"What about you, Rei?" Asuka asked.  
"那你呢，绫波？" 明日香问道。

"I will find Commander Ikari and Adam."  
"我会找到碇司令和亚当。"

"Okay. Shinji, take Misato and Rei to the Geofront, now!"  
"好的。真嗣，带上美里和绫波去地底都市，现在！"

Shinji shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. "S-sure, Asuka. What are you gonna do?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，试图理清思绪。“好、好的，明日香。你打算怎么办？”

"Anta Baka? They are clearly after the pilots, right? That means Hikari and Toji might be in danger as well! I need to make sure they are safe!" Asuka answered, summoning a small sea of Dirac, "Now go!"  
"你是笨蛋吗？他们显然是冲着驾驶员来的，对吧？那意味着光和剑介也可能有危险！我得确保他们安全！" 明日香回答道，召唤出一小片狄拉克海，"现在去吧！"

Toji Suzuhara was having a good time with his girlfriend. He was happy that he could finally cuddle with Hikari on the couch, watching a horror movie. Hikari's father took out her two sisters for dinner, leaving her some time alone with the Jock.  
铃原东治正和他的女朋友度过愉快的时光。他很高兴终于能和光在沙发上依偎着看恐怖电影了。光的父亲带走了她的两个妹妹去吃晚饭，留给她一些与这位运动健将独处的时间。

"She reminds me of the Red Devil," Toji commented as he saw a ghost in red on TV, "damn, even the hair color matches."  
"她让我想起了红色恶魔，" 东治看到电视上的红衣幽灵时评论道，"该死，连发色都一样。"

"Toji! Asuka's my friend! It's not good to say that!" Hikari frowned a little, her tone slightly disapproving.  
"冬二！明日香是我的朋友！那样说不好！" 光皱了皱眉，语气略带责备。

"Heh, it's not like she can hear me! I'll try not to call her that in front of her, sounds good?"  
"嘿，她又听不见我说话！我会尽量不在她面前这么叫她，这样行了吧？"

"Okay. Promise." Hikari jabbed him.  
"好吧。你得答应我。" 光戳了戳他。

"Alright, alright. I, Toji Suzuhara, promise that I won't call Asuka Langley Soryu the Red Devil in her vicinity."  
"好了，好了。我，铃原东治，保证不会在明日香·兰格雷附近叫她红魔。"

"Then your promise is already broken, gorilla!"  
"那你的承诺已经打破了，大猩猩！"

Both Hikari and Toji jerked their heads to the source of the voice, just to see Asuka standing right beside them, glaring at the Jock.  
光和铃原都猛地转头看向声音的来源，只见明日香正站在他们旁边，怒视着那个运动员。

"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?! HOW DID YOU GET  
“你到底在这里搞什么鬼？！你是怎么进来的？”

IN?!" Toji yelled, quickly disentangling himself from Hikari, who was in shell shock and unable to articulate any words.  
“进来？！” 冬二大喊，迅速从光子身边挣脱，光子处于震惊状态，无法说出任何话。

"Listen, I don't have time to explain, just come with me!"  
“听着，我没时间解释，快跟我走！”

"Speak of the Devil… What for? We're having…" He was interrupted by the sound of the front door being kicked open, and a group of soldiers rushed in. Without hesitation, they aimed and fired; Toji and Hikari were like deers caught in the headlight, unable to fight nor flight. Asuka deployed her AT-Field just in time, blocking all the bullets. The soldiers weres dumbfounded by the sight; Asuka utilized their moment of distraction and pulled her friend and the Jock into  
"说曹操曹操到……为什么？我们正在……" 他话音未落，前门被一脚踢开，一群士兵冲了进来。他们毫不犹豫地瞄准并开火；真嗣和美里如同被车灯照住的鹿，既无法反抗也无法逃脱。明日香及时展开了 AT 力场，挡下了所有子弹。士兵们被这一幕惊呆了；明日香利用他们分神的瞬间，拉着朋友和那个运动员冲进了

the sea of Dirac.  
狄拉克之海。

SEELE 03: "Our assassination attempts seemed to fail. The pilots are still alive, and presumably already inside NERV Headquarters."  
SEELE 03: "我们的暗杀行动似乎失败了。驾驶员们还活着，想必已经进入了 NERV 总部。"

SEELE 01: "That is indeed unexpected. The assassins we sent were all professional. We do not have more spare time. Commence the attack."  
基尔议会 01: “这确实出乎意料。我们派出的杀手都是专业的。我们没有更多时间了。立即发动攻击。”

SEELE 05: "I'll contact other NERV branches and inform them to start hacking the-"  
基尔议会 05: “我会联系其他 NERV 分部，通知他们开始入侵——”

SEELE 01: "That is not necessary. Launch the invasion forces immediately," a pause, "and leave none alive."  
基尔议会 01: “那没有必要。立即发动入侵部队，”停顿一下，“一个不留。”

Tokyo-3 remained deathly silent as squads of highly trained armed soldiers clad in black slithered through the trees and bushes, silently making their way closer to the entrance of the GeoFront. Lines of tanks, humvees, and missile trucks rushed along the empty roads, lining all along the outskirts of Tokyo-3. The General who was leading this operation had always been one of the anti-NERV and anti-EVA officers. However, he found himself taking no pleasure in this attack. The orders he was given were to kill all NERV personnel on sight without hesitation. Security, technicians, maintenance workers, even the janitors. Anyone who was inside of NERV Headquarters and wasn't a JSSDF soldier was to be killed on the  
东京-3 依旧死寂一片，身着黑色制服、训练有素的武装士兵小队悄无声息地穿过树林和灌木丛，缓缓逼近 GeoFront 的入口。坦克、悍马和导弹卡车排成一行，沿着东京-3 的郊区空荡荡的道路疾驰，严阵以待。指挥此次行动的将军一直是反 NERV 和反 EVA 的军官之一。然而，他发现自己并未从这次攻击中获得任何快感。他接到的命令是毫不犹豫地射杀所有 NERV 人员，无论是安保、技术人员、维修工人，甚至是清洁工。任何身处 NERV 总部而非 JSSDF 士兵的人，都将在

spot.

"Are you alright, sir?" The driver asked, looking over at the older man who was rubbing his index finger and his thumb against his temples. "I'm fine." He grunted, opening the door and stepping out onto the road. As he made his way over to the edge of the cliff, he pulled out a pair of binoculars and zoomed in on the cityscape of Tokyo-3.  
“您还好吗，先生？”司机问道，目光投向那位正用食指和拇指揉按太阳穴的老人。“我没事。”他咕哝着，推开车门，踏上了路面。他走向悬崖边缘，掏出一副双筒望远镜，对准了东京-3 的城市景观，拉近了视野。

"Are all troops in position?" He asked, looking up and down at the empty city. He took a bit of solace in seeing that the Tokyo-3 was as empty, just as SEELE claimed it was. He was well aware that there was going to be a massive amount of blood spilled today, and the last thing he wanted was for some of it to be the blood of innocent civilians.  
“所有部队都就位了吗？”他问道，目光上下打量着这座空城。看到第三新东京市如 SEELE 所言空无一人，他稍感安慰。他深知今天将会血流成河，最不希望的就是有无辜平民的鲜血掺杂其中。

"Yes sir." His Second Lieutenant nodded, stepping up next to the General. "All infantry soldiers are ready and waiting for your orders."  
“是的，长官。”他的副官点头，走到将军身旁。“所有步兵已准备就绪，等待您的命令。”

The General sighed in disapproval of his actions, letting down the binocular. He really didn't want to do this, but he was told NERV was going to initiate Third Impact and end the world, not to mention he was given the order to destroy it. He knew perfectly well what he should do. "Commence the operation."  
将军不满地叹了口气，放下了望远镜。他真的不想这么做，但被告知 NERV 将启动第三次冲击并终结世界，更不用说他接到了摧毁它的命令。他非常清楚自己该做什么。“开始行动。”

The sound of artillery fire, missile launching, and explosions filled the city of Tokyo-3 as tanks and missile trucks opened fire into NERV's missile batteries. The UN had been more than happy to provide a detailed map of NERV's exterior facility, as well as the blueprints for Central Dogma, allowing for the JSSDF forces to lay waste to their defensive measures before they even had a chance to use them.  
东京-3 市上空回荡着炮火轰鸣、导弹发射与爆炸的巨响，坦克和导弹卡车向 NERV 的导弹电池开火。联合国非常乐意提供 NERV 外部设施的详细地图以及中央教条区的蓝图，使得日本自卫队能在 NERV 防御措施还未启动前就将其摧毁殆尽。

One by one, radar stations and turrets erupted into balls of fire and debris as high-explosive artillery rounds ripped through them and missiles set ablaze everything they came into contact with. Once NERV's exterior defenses were no more, the JSSDF foot soldiers began their approach, swiftly and violently procuring the entrances leading into the GeoFront.  
雷达站和炮塔一个接一个化为火球和碎片，高爆炮弹穿透它们，导弹所触之处皆化为火海。NERV 的外部防御被彻底摧毁后，日本自卫队的步兵开始推进，迅速而猛烈地占领通往地底都市的入口。

As expected, NERV's security stood no chance against them. Those who managed to survive the initial encounters and were able to drop  
正如预料的那样，NERV 的安保力量在他们面前不堪一击。那些侥幸在初次交锋中存活下来并设法投降的人，

their weapons and surrender either had their throats slit or a bullet put through their head.  
他们的武器被缴，要么被割喉，要么头部中弹。

"Radar station three has been destroyed!" Aoba yelled, "The Angel Intercept System is only twenty-one percent operational!"  
"雷达站三号已被摧毁！" 青叶大喊，"天使拦截系统仅剩百分之二十一的运作率！"

"Where are Major Katsuragi and the pilots?" Fuyutsuki asked, a sense of dread spread through his chest.  
"葛城美里少校和驾驶员们在哪里？" 冬月问道，心中涌起一股不祥的预感。

"Major Katsuragi reporting in!" Misato suddenly emerged at the lower deck, walking toward the elevator. The technicians were confused since no security camera had picked up her image, and she just suddenly appeared from nowhere. However, they shook it off since there was more pressing matters at hands. "Good to see you, Major."  
"葛城美里少校报到！" 美里突然出现在下层甲板，向电梯走去。技术人员们感到困惑，因为没有任何监控摄像头捕捉到她的影像，她就像凭空出现一样。不过，他们很快抛开了疑惑，因为手头有更紧迫的事情要处理。"很高兴见到你，少校。"

"Wait… Pilot Ikari had just finished changing and now heading to the EVA cages! Pilot Suzuhara and Pilot Horaki are inside the First Cranial Nerve ward! How did they get there without being noticed by our security cameras…" Makoto reported in confusion, "Still no sign of Pilot Ayanami!" He paused for a second, eyes went wide as he saw a certain redhead appeared in the video feed as well, "Pilot… Soryu?"  
"等等……碇真嗣驾驶员刚刚换好衣服，正前往 EVA 格纳库！铃原东治驾驶员和洞木光驾驶员在第一脑神经病房内！他们是怎么在没有被我们的监控摄像头发现的情况下到达那里的……" 真希波困惑地报告道，"仍然没有绫波零驾驶员的踪迹！" 他停顿了一下，眼睛睁大，因为他看到某个红发女孩也出现在了视频画面中，"惣流·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员？"

"I will explain later, now just accept it! Launch Unit D immediately when the pilots get inside!" Misato forced down a grin as she knew her charges had succeeded in rescuing their friends. She also knew that Rei was trying to find Gendo. 'Rei, please succeed,' she thought.  
"我稍后会解释，现在先接受事实！等驾驶员们进入后立即启动 D 单位！" 美里强忍住笑意，因为她知道她的学生们已经成功救出了他们的朋友。她也知道绫波正在寻找碇源堂。'绫波，请成功，' 她心想。

The second Unit D emerged onto the surface, all of the JSSDF's forces quickly locked onto the purple-crimson EVA and opened fire onto it before it could even move. Shinji and Asuka both flinched as the rain of cannon and missile fire smashed into the mech, but did little more than that. Conventional weapons were hardly capable of doing more than minor damage to an Evangelion, and all it did to the pilots was piss them off.  
第二台 D 型 EVA 冲出地面，JSSDF 的所有部队迅速锁定那台紫红色的 EVA 并开火，使其在移动之前就遭受了猛烈的炮火和导弹攻击。真嗣和明日香都因这密集的炮火而畏缩，但这除了激怒他们外，几乎没有造成任何伤害。常规武器对 EVA 来说几乎只能造成轻微损伤，而这一切只是让驾驶员更加愤怒。

"What the Hell was that supposed to be?!" Asuka laughed maniacally as they willed for Unit D to begin moving. "Was it supposed to hurt?!" Dashing forward, the EVA leaped into the air and landed hard atop of a series of tanks, crushing them into piles of scorched junk and erupting into balls of fire. Once she planted her feet, the redhead caught sight of a barrage of missiles heading her way. Acting quickly, she swiped Unit D's lower left arm to the side, knocking all of the missiles off course and sending them crashing into the ground where they exploded on contact, taking down a line of tanks, humvees, and foot soldiers along with them.  
“那到底是什么意思？！”明日香狂笑着，催动 D 型 EVA 开始移动。“以为这能伤到我们吗？！”EVA 疾驰向前，一跃而起，重重落在坦克群上，将它们压成一堆堆烧焦的废铁，引发一连串爆炸。她一落地，就看到一排导弹朝她飞来。她迅速挥动 D 型 EVA 的左下臂，将所有导弹打偏，导弹随即坠地爆炸，连带摧毁了一排坦克、悍马车和步兵。

Just as Unit D dug its right heel into the ground while it skidded across the GeoFront, the soldiers inside of the missile trucks quickly abandoned their vehicles and left them to be laid to waste by the monstrous machine.  
正当 D 单位将右脚跟深深扎入地表，在 GeoFront 上滑行之际，导弹卡车内的士兵们迅速弃车而逃，任由这些车辆被那台巨型机器摧毁殆尽。

"General! What are we going to do?!" Narrowing his eyes, the General glared at the purple-crimson death machine as it scooped up a tank and flung it with precise accuracy at one of the larger missile trucks, destroying both of them. Letting out a sigh, the General pulled his own radio out from his pocket and held it up to his mouth. He really didn't want for it to have to come to this. He really didn't want for SEELE to get involved, but he had no choice at this point. It was either they get involved, or he would have to let this mission fail. "Commence Operation Armageddon." Within a matter of seconds, all fire came to a halt. Shinji and Asuka found themselves stopping momentarily, confused by the JSSDF's sudden lack of resistance. Had they surrendered? Was it over? Did they win? From inside Unit D, she watched as the lines of the remaining vehicles pulled back and cleared out from the center of the GeoFront. "What the Hell's going on?" Asuka growled, beginning to feel uneasy about this whole situation. "Maya, Hyuga, somebody? What's going on?" Shinji asked, keeping a cautious eye on the surrounding forces.  
"将军！我们该怎么办？！"将军眯起眼睛，怒视着那台紫红色的死亡机器，它精准地抓起一辆坦克，将其投向其中一辆大型导弹卡车，两者同归于尽。将军叹了口气，从口袋里掏出自己的无线电，举到嘴边。他实在不想走到这一步，真的不想让 SEELE 介入，但此刻别无选择。要么他们介入，要么只能让这次任务失败。"启动‘末日行动’。"短短几秒钟内，所有火力都停止了。真嗣和明日香暂时停下，对日本自卫队突然的毫无抵抗感到困惑。他们投降了吗？结束了吗？他们赢了吗？在 D 型机内部，她看到剩余的车辆队伍撤离并清空了 GeoFront 的中心区域。"这到底是怎么回事？"明日香咆哮着，开始对这个局面感到不安。"玛雅，日向，有人吗？发生了什么？"真嗣问道，警惕地观察着周围的部队。

"Shinji, Asuka, get down!" Maya's scream filled the cockpit, cracking up with static. "Wait, wha-"  
"真嗣，明日香，快趴下！" 玛雅的尖叫声在驾驶舱内响起，伴随着静电的噼啪声。"等等，什——"

A sudden jarring rumble shook the entire EVA Unit, knocking it off of its feet and onto the ground as a brilliant white light shone above it. The pilots could feel searing heat radiating from the light, but it wasn't quite able to come into contact with her. "they just dropped an N2 mine on us!"  
突然的剧烈震动让整个 EVA 机体失去了平衡，摔倒在地，上方闪耀着耀眼的白光。驾驶员们能感受到从光芒中散发出的灼热高温，但它并未真正触及她们。"他们刚刚在我们头顶投下了 N2 地雷！"

"That's a little bit much!" Aoba scoffed, looking at the terminal. "Not only that, but we're detecting incoming aircraft."  
"这有点过分了吧！" 青叶嗤之以鼻，盯着终端屏幕。"不仅如此，我们还探测到有飞机正在接近。"

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Ooh, a few VTOLs and helicopters. I'm so scared."  
明日香翻了个白眼。“哦，几架垂直起降机和直升机。我好害怕。”

"These aren't combat aircrafts, Asuka." Maya's voice came across far too solemn for the Second Child's liking. "They're dropships."  
“这些不是战斗机，明日香。” 真希波的声音听起来过于严肃，让二号适格者不太舒服。“它们是运输船。”

"Dropships?" She raised an eyebrow. "Shit, the MP EVAs!"  
“运输船？”她挑了挑眉。“该死，是 MP EVA！”

Twelve large V-shaped aircraft soared over the GeoFront, each craft carrying some sort of strange figure on their belly. The abnormal white figures slowly pulled themselves away from the underside of the aircraft and scanned their surroundings as unmanned Entry Plugs shot into the back of their necks, bringing them into a fully aware state of consciousness. The one locked into the belly of the lowest flying aircraft, the eldest of the twelve let a sick smile spread across its fish-like head as it disengaged from the locks holding it in place, allowing for it to begin freefalling before sprouting a great pair of angelic wings from its back, gliding across the air as it descended into the now fully exposed GeoFront. The other eleven followed suit, dropping from their respective aircrafts and unfolding their wings, following in its path as it started to orbiting around Unit D from above. The nine giant humanoid machines flew around in the purple- crimson Evangelion in the same way that buzzards would circle their dying prey, waiting for the moment to swoop down and devour the remains.  
十二架巨大的 V 型飞行器在 GeoFront 上空翱翔，每架飞行器的腹部都搭载着某种奇异的图案。这些异常的白色身影缓缓从飞行器底部脱离，环顾四周，无人驾驶的插入栓随即射入它们的后颈，使其完全清醒过来。其中，位于最低飞行器腹部的十二者之首，脸上露出了病态的微笑，它解开固定装置，开始自由落体，随后从背部展开一对巨大的天使之翼，滑翔着向如今完全暴露的 GeoFront 降落。其余十一个也纷纷效仿，从各自的飞行器上跃下，展开翅膀，跟随其轨迹开始在 D 单位上方盘旋。九台巨大的类人形机器围绕着紫红色的 EVA 飞舞，宛如秃鹫环绕濒死的猎物，等待时机俯冲而下，吞噬残骸。

"There are TWELVE of them?" Asuka shouted in disbelief, but she regained her confidence in a second, "hmph, just adds more to my glory!"  
"有十二个？" 明日香难以置信地喊道，但她随即重拾自信，"哼，正好让我的荣耀更加闪耀！"

"Asuka, this is not the time! We need to focus!" Shinji said, a bit panicking as his memories resurfaced, "We… we need to…"  
"明日香，现在不是时候！我们需要集中注意力！" 真嗣说道，记忆的复苏让他有些慌乱，"我们…我们需要…"

"Don't worry, Baka," Asuka reassured him, "We need to destroy the cores, or they will keep regenerating!"  
"别担心，笨蛋，" 明日香安慰他，"我们需要摧毁核心，否则它们会不断再生！"

Inside of the Command Center, Fuyutsuki narrowed his eyes. "They're sending the MP EVAs here?" He murmured to himself. "They couldn't possibly be planning to…" Leaning forward into the microphone, the Commander called out to the pilot of Unit D.  
在指挥中心内部，冬月眯起了眼睛。“他们要把 MP EVAs 派到这里来？”他喃喃自语，“他们不可能打算……”指挥官向前倾身，对着麦克风呼叫 D 型机的驾驶员。

"Just be careful." "只是要小心。"

"I'll try not to have too much fun." The redhead smirked, tightening the grip on her controls as the winged beasts lowered themselves onto the ground, pulling their wings inside of their bodies and brandishing their large, dual-bladed swords.  
“我会尽量不玩得太开心。”红发女孩微微一笑，握紧操纵杆，那些长着翅膀的怪兽降落在地面上，收起翅膀，挥舞着它们巨大的双刃剑。

The pilots quickly chose their first target; not giving it any time to prepare for them, both Shinji and Asuka willed Unit D lunged forward and smashed its right foot directly into the top of the Evangelion's skull, shattering the top of its cranium, and exposing the gore beneath it as the top of its fish-like head exploded into a cloud of blood-red LCL before dropping limply to the ground. They took its weapon as it transformed into the shape of Lance of Longinus, and stabbed it right into the defeated MP EVA's core.  
驾驶员们迅速选定了第一个目标；不给它任何准备的时间，真嗣和明日香操控 D 型机猛地向前一跃，右脚直接踩碎了使徒头顶，颅骨破碎，血肉模糊的内部暴露无遗，鱼形头部的顶端炸成一片血红色的 LCL 云雾，随后无力地倒在地上。他们夺取了它的武器，将其变形为朗基努斯之枪，直刺败北的 MP EVA 的核心。

One down, eleven to go.  
一个倒下，还有十一个。

Deep down inside Central Dogma, Rei Ayanami gazed at the bloodied pool of LCL filled with half-rotted limbs and small fragments of what used to be her fellow clones. The blue-haired girl slowly stepped back towards the tube in the center of the circular room and scanned her eyes across the comatose body that was Gendo Ikari.  
在中央教条区的深处，绫波零凝视着那滩血迹斑斑的 LCL 池，里面混杂着半腐烂的肢体和曾是她克隆体同伴的小碎片。蓝发少女缓缓后退，走向圆形房间中央的管道，目光扫过昏迷中的碇源堂。

She had found herself lost in a near hypnotic state, feeling compelled to come to this very chamber and see the rotten remains  
她发现自己陷入了一种近乎催眠的状态，感到一种无法抗拒的冲动，要来到这个密室，亲眼目睹那些腐烂的遗骸

of her dead sisters.  
她已故姐妹们的遗骸。

Turning around, Rei's vision suddenly changed. She now could see an overlooking view of the cityscape of Tokyo-3, but it was much different than she remembered. The buildings were decrepit and crumbling, long since abandon. Past the city, she could see the ocean, but instead of it flowing with its calming blue waters, it ran thick with dark red spreading out as far as she could see, giant red crosses protruding from random points with hideous white beasts  
转身之际，丽的眼界突然发生了变化。她现在可以看到东京-3 的城市景观，但与她记忆中的大相径庭。建筑物破败不堪，早已被遗弃。城市的尽头，她能看到海洋，但不再是那平静的蓝色水域，而是流淌着深红色，蔓延至她目力所及之处，巨大的红色十字架从各处突兀地伸出，伴随着丑陋的白色怪兽

crucified on them. 被它们钉死。

"Where am I?" She asked, feeling a presence emerge behind her. Slowly, she turned around and came face to face with a boy who, in a way looked much like her. His skin fair and his eyes red. Like her, he stood before her in the nude. Rei recognized him as Kaworu Nagisa.  
“我在哪儿？”她问道，感觉到一个存在在她身后出现。她缓缓转身，迎面遇见一个男孩，某种程度上看起来与她颇为相似。他的皮肤白皙，眼睛赤红。和她一样，他赤裸着站在她面前。丽认出他是渚薰。

"This is the future that you will create." Kaworu answered, stepping past her and making his way towards her as he gazed down at the desolate city. "You are to be the one who will bring about the death of the world you know, and let it become reborn anew."  
“这是你将创造的未来。”渚薰回答，从她身边走过，向她走来，俯视着荒凉的城市。“你将成为那个带来你所知世界的终结，使其重生的人。”

"I… I will cause this?" The blue-haired girl slowly stepped next to the silver-haired boy. "How?"  
"我…我会造成这一切吗？" 蓝发女孩缓缓走向银发男孩。"怎么会？"

"You are Lilith. You are the one who will bring about Instrumentality."  
"你是莉莉丝。你将是引发人类补完计划的那个人。"

"No." Rei shook her head. "I am me. I have my own will. I do not wish to hurt Shinji, Asuka, or Misato. I have made my decision."  
"不。" 绫波摇了摇头。"我是我。我有自己的意志。我不希望伤害真嗣、明日香或美里。我已经做出了决定。"

The boy turned his head to face her. "You cannot deny your own destiny. You are to create this world through rebirth."  
男孩转过头面对她。“你无法否认自己的命运。你注定要通过重生来创造这个世界。”

"No. This is not the world that I want."  
“不。这不是我想要的世界。”

"But why, Lilith? By creating this world, you will be giving humanity the gift of true transcendence. Humanity will pool into one collective consciousness that will create the ultimate being." Ayanami moved  
“但为什么，莉莉丝？通过创造这个世界，你将赋予人类真正的超越之礼。人类将汇聚成一个集体意识，创造出终极存在。”绫波动了起来

her sharp crimson eyes and beamed them into the boy's. "If humanity is to become something new, then wouldn't that just mean that it would really be humanity's extinction?"  
她锐利的绯红眼眸直射向男孩。“如果人类要变成某种新事物，那不就意味着人类真的要灭绝了吗？”

The boy smirked. "As I said, death must come before rebirth." "Just who are you? You're not the Kaworu Nagisa I knew…"  
男孩轻蔑一笑。“正如我所说，死亡必先于重生。”“你到底是谁？你不是我所认识的渚薰……”

Kaworu chuckled, "Perceptive, I must say. No, I am not the seventeenth Angel you know of. In fact, I am Adam."  
渚薰轻笑道，“你很敏锐。没错，我不是你所知的第十七使徒。事实上，我是亚当。”

"Adam?" Rei narrowed her eyes, "how did you…"  
"亚当？" 丽眯起眼睛，"你怎么会……"

"The person… who was in charge of NERV had me planted in his hands. When Tabris died, the soul he carried was freed, and it came and found me. Fortunately, at the time I was soaked inside LCL - thus I can recreate this body."  
"负责 NERV 的那个人把我植入他手中。当塔布里斯死去时，他所承载的灵魂被释放，找到了我。幸运的是，那时我浸泡在 LCL 中——因此我能重塑这个身体。"

"Still." She spoke, stepping forth, staring into the eyes of the giant head off in the distance. "This is not the world that I want."  
"即便如此。" 她向前迈步，凝视着远处巨大的头颅。"这不是我想要的世界。"

"And why is that?"  
"为什么这么说？"

"Because, this is not the world that Shinji would want."  
"因为，这不是真嗣想要的世界。"

He chuckled, managing a very visible grin. "I guess we really are alike after all." Letting out a sigh, his grin began to slowly turn into a frown. "Unfortunately, that means that you have chosen this future instead." The boy made a gesture with his right hand, and the world around them began to morph before Rei's very eyes.  
他轻笑一声，露出了明显的笑容。“我想我们终究还是很相似。”他叹了口气，笑容逐渐转为皱眉。“不幸的是，这意味着你选择了这个未来。”男孩用右手做了一个手势，周围的世界开始在绫波眼前变形。

The clear sky became thick with black clouds, hiding away the bright stars and the bloodstained moon. The derelict buildings of Tokyo-3 lit ablaze as a great fire filled the metropolis. The blood red ocean turned a darker shade of blue as giant battleships and aircraft carriers rose from the depths, brilliant flashes of light filling the sky as thunderous booms of their cannon fire echoed through the air. Then, the final thing to appear was the figure of two colossal humanoid  
晴朗的天空布满了厚重的乌云，遮住了明亮的星星和染血的月亮。东京-3 的废弃建筑燃起了熊熊大火，整个城市陷入火海。血红色的海洋变成了更深的蓝色，巨大的战舰和航空母舰从深海中升起，天空中闪烁着耀眼的光芒，雷鸣般的炮火声在空中回荡。最后出现的是两个巨大的类人形身影。

machines trading blows along the coast. One of them Rei was immediately able to recognize as Unit D, the other, however, was one she had never seen before. It shared a similar build, but its details were impossible to make out.  
机器沿着海岸互相对抗。其中一台雷伊立刻认出是 D 型机，但另一台她从未见过。它的外形相似，但细节却难以辨认。

"What is this?" She sounded almost disgusted by the sight of this horrible place.  
“这是什么？”她对这个可怕的地方的景象几乎感到厌恶。

"I've already told you, this is the future you have chosen." The silver- haired boy replied. "While the world I presented you with before may not have been the most desired outcome, this is the one that is destined to happen should mankind continue to survive." As the two Evangelions on the beach traded blows, Unit D took hold of its opponent by the neck and slammed it onto the sandy beach, keeping its hands wrapped tightly around its throat.  
“我已经告诉过你，这是你选择未来的结果。”银发少年回答道，“虽然我之前展示给你的世界可能不是最理想的结果，但如果人类继续生存下去，这就是注定会发生的事情。”当海滩上的两台福音战士互相对抗时，D 型机抓住对手的脖子，将其猛摔在沙滩上，双手紧紧勒住对方的喉咙。

"What happened?" Ayanami growled, feeling a tinge of anger rising within her. "Why is this what will happen if mankind continues to survive?"  
"发生了什么？" 绫波低吼道，感到一丝怒气在心中升起。"为什么这就是人类继续生存的结局？"

"Because, Lilin are doomed to fight until the end of time. It is just what they do best." He replied. "While preventing Instrumentality may give you a moment's peace, what's to follow is nothing but death, destruction, and hardship." While Unit D held its opponent down, the pinned EVA reached up and tightly wrapped its own hands around Unit D's throat, tightening its grip with each second that passed.  
"因为，莉林注定要战斗到时间的尽头。这是他们最擅长的事。" 他回答道。"虽然阻止融合可能给你带来片刻的安宁，但接下来只会是死亡、毁灭和苦难。" 当 D 型机压制住对手时，被压制的 EVA 伸出手紧紧缠绕在 D 型机的脖子上，每过一秒，它的握力都在加强。

"I do not believe you."  
"我不相信你。"

"Believe what you want. This is what is destined to happen should Instrumentality be prevented." With a loud, bone-chilling crack, Unit D's head fell limp along with the rest of its body while the Evangelion it had pinned down rose onto its feet, keeping the lifeless Unit D in its grasp. Belting out a roar of fury, the ground shook at the monstrous machine's cry.  
"相信你愿意相信的。如果阻止了人类补完计划，这就是注定会发生的事。"随着一声令人毛骨悚然的巨响，D 型机的头部连同身体一起瘫软下来，而被它压制的 EVA 则站起身来，依旧紧握着毫无生气的 D 型机。发出一声愤怒的咆哮，这台巨型机器的吼声震动了大地。

"Do you truly believe that this is the future Shinji wants?" Staring dumbfounded at the sight, Rei felt a pit in her stomach. Was this truly to be the final outcome if she were to not allow for Instrumentality to commence? Was this just a doomed world that could not truly be saved? "What should I do?"  
"你真的认为这是真嗣想要的未来吗？"望着这一幕，绫波感到一阵茫然，心中涌起不安。如果她不允许人类补完计划进行，这真的是最终的结果吗？这难道是一个注定无法真正得救的世界吗？"我该怎么办？"

"I'm here to offer you a choice." The boy smirked. "You are the one who controls the future, and I will present a new path to you."  
"我是来给你一个选择的。"男孩微微一笑。"你是掌控未来的人，我将为你展示一条新的道路。"

"Which is?" "那是哪个？"

"A world without Evangelions."  
"一个没有福音战士的世界。"

Rei blinked. "How would we do that?" "Reversing the time."  
绫波零眨了眨眼。 "怎么做到呢？" "逆转时间。"

"Shinji had informed me you said time is irreversible."  
"真嗣告诉我，你说过时间是不可逆的。"

"Not exactly reversing time - but similar enough. We couldn't do this before since during all the previous cycles, we only had Adam, Lilith, Unit 01, and Lilin. Now the situation is different."  
"并非真正逆转时间——但足够相似了。以前我们做不到，因为在之前的所有循环中，我们只有亚当、莉莉丝、零号机和人类。现在情况不同了。"

"I do not understand."  
"我不明白。"

"Now, we have two more Angel level beings in this world, their power akin to us."  
"现在，我们这个世界又多了两位天使级别的存在，他们的力量与我们相当。"

"Shinji and Asuka?" Rei said, her eyes narrowing, "what about them?"  
"真嗣和明日香？" 绫波说，她的眼睛眯了起来，"他们怎么了？"

"With their help, the combined power of four of us would be enough to recreate a new world. We could manage to recreate a world without Second Impact happening," Kaworu's smirk grew wider, "more than enough, don't you think?"  
"有了他们的帮助，我们四人联合的力量足以创造一个新世界。我们可以设法创造一个没有第二次冲击发生的世界，" 渚薰的微笑更甚，"绰绰有余，你不觉得吗？"

"Die, you bastard!" Asuka shrieked, tackling one of the EVAs into the giant artificial lake, throttling it while she held it underwater. Opening  
“去死吧，混蛋！”明日香尖叫着，将一台 EVA 扑倒在巨大的人工湖中，将其按在水下猛烈攻击。她打开

her right shoulder pylon, she ejected her progressive knife and struck down onto the Evangelion's grotesque face, spewing a fountain of gore into the water, reddening it as she stabbed into it again and again, watching as its hands clenched and its body started to spasm violently until finally going limp. She then pulled the knife out of its skull, and stabbed it right into its core. The core cracked, but her knife also broke. Discarding the handle of the broken blade, the pilots raised their fists, and slammed into the core. It finally shattered after a dozen of ground-breaking punches.  
右肩的挂架，弹出她的高频刀，猛地刺向 EVA 那丑陋的面孔，一股血泉喷涌而出，染红了湖水，她一次又一次地刺入，看着它的双手紧握，身体开始剧烈抽搐，最终瘫软下来。随后，她从其头颅中拔出刀，直刺入核心。核心裂开，但她的刀也断了。丢弃断刃的刀柄，驾驶员们举起拳头，猛击核心。经过十几记重拳，核心终于碎裂。

Turning around, the pilots caught sight of two of the MP EVAs closing in on them, their dual-bladed weapons at the ready. The first went for a low swing, which Unit D was easily able to leap over and counter by slamming its foot down onto the blade, knocking it out of her opponent's hand. The second one was a bit harder to avoid, forcing Unit D to rely on catching the blade with her bare hand. Shinji and Asuka cringed, feeling the sharp pain of the blade cutting into Unit D's hand. Bubbles from the LCL started to form around the pilots' actual hands as it absorbed the blood leaking from their plug suit. Their sync ratio was too high to not receive real damage.  
转过身，驾驶员们注意到两台 MP EVAs 正向他们逼近，双刃武器已准备就绪。第一台发动了低空横扫，D 型机轻松跃过并反击，一脚踩在刀刃上，将其从对手手中击落。第二台则更难躲避，迫使 D 型机用裸手接住刀刃。真嗣和明日香皱眉，感受到刀刃切入 D 型机手掌的剧痛。LCL 中开始形成气泡，围绕着驾驶员实际的手，吸收着从插入栓服中渗出的血液。他们的同步率太高，无法不承受真实的伤害。

However, a high synch ratio was not without its benefits. It allowed for them to do far more than just control their EVA better, it enhanced its strength tenfold as well. Pulling hard, the pilots yanked the blade out of the enemy's hand and grasped the heavy blade, making a giant horizontal cleave, cutting through both of the EVA's standing before them, bisecting them at the waist, drenching the surrounding area with blood-red LCL. After breaking their cores, Asuka counted, "Four down, eight to go."  
然而，高同步率并非没有好处。它不仅使他们能更好地控制 EVA，还将其力量增强了十倍。驾驶员们用力一拉，将刀刃从敌人手中夺走，握住沉重的刀刃，进行了一次巨大的水平斩击，将面前两台 EVA 从腰部一分为二，血红色的 LCL 浸透了周围区域。在破坏了它们的核心后，明日香数道：“四台已解决，还有八台。”

Looking intently at Lilith's crucified body, Rei was having a turmoil of thoughts running through her head. Kaworu, or Adam in this case, was simply waiting aside her, grinning. The large chamber was quieter than usual, probably caused by Rei's drastically shifting AT- Field.  
凝视着莉莉丝被钉十字架的身躯，丽脑海中思绪翻涌。渚薰，或者说在此情况下的亚当，只是静静地站在她身旁，微笑着。巨大的房间比平时更为寂静，这可能是由于丽剧烈波动的 AT 力场所致。

'If I destroy Adam, and refuse to merge with Lilith, then the EVAs will preserve, humanity will become its own enemy. In that case, Shinji and Asuka will most likely be forced to continue to pilot against other humans. There will be two possible outcomes; one of them dies, and the other will be devastated. Or they both live, but at least Shinji will suffer emotionally since he does not wish to harm another human.  
“如果我摧毁亚当，拒绝与莉莉丝融合，那么 EVA 将得以保留，人类将成为自己的敌人。那样的话，真嗣和明日香很可能会被迫继续驾驶 EVA 对抗其他人类。这将导致两种可能的结果；其中一人死去，另一人则陷入深深的绝望。或者他们都活下来，但至少真嗣会承受情感上的痛苦，因为他并不希望伤害任何人。”

I… do not wish harm to Shinji. I want him to be happy. As long as EVAs exist, there will be chances he gets hurt.'  
“我……不想让真嗣受到伤害。我希望他幸福。只要 EVA 存在，他就有可能受伤。”

'The choice Kaw-Adam offers is… alluring. It sounds too good to be true… I can feel there are some things he wasn't honest with me.'  
“高-亚当提出的选择……很诱人。听起来好得令人难以置信……我能感觉到他有些事情没有对我坦白。”

Rei took a deep breath, and turned her look at Kaworu, "About your offer… can I ask what is your motive?"  
丽深吸了一口气，转向渚薰，“关于你的提议……我能问一下你的动机是什么吗？”

Kaworu chuckled, "Simple. The same as yours," he kept his smirk, "I want Shinji to be happy."  
渚薰轻笑道，“很简单。和你一样，”他保持着微笑，“我希望真嗣能幸福。”

"What will happen to them if we help them to… reverse the time?"  
“如果我们帮助他们……逆转时间，会发生什么？”

Kaworu's expression suddenly became serious, "During the process, they will become Gods."  
渚薰的表情突然变得严肃，“在这个过程中，他们会成为神。”

Rei blinked, "If that's the case… I am more willing to help you. But I figure there is something you're not honest with me, Adam."  
绫波零眨了眨眼，“如果是这样的话……我更愿意帮助你。但我觉得你对我有所隐瞒，亚当。”

Kaworu chuckled, "You are intelligent, to say the least, Lilith. The Shinji and Asuka who are fighting up there right now are not the original Shinji and Asuka from this world. The process will make those two Gods… What will happen next… I cannot predict. I do not exactly have references, do I?"  
渚薰轻笑道，“至少可以说，你很聪明，莉莉丝。现在正在上面战斗的真嗣和明日香，并不是这个世界的原版真嗣和明日香。这个过程会让那两人成为神……接下来会发生什么……我无法预料。我没有确切的参考，对吧？”

Rei took a deep breath, "What do we need to do?"  
绫波深吸一口气，“我们需要做什么？”

"Simple. We merge with Lilith's body, and find our way to Shinji and Asuka. Then we will create a small instrumentality with only four of us; we will need to use the Lance of Longinus as well…" He trailed off, his face suddenly clouded, "This is not good."  
“简单。我们与莉莉丝的身体融合，找到真嗣和明日香。然后我们四人将创造一个小型的集体潜意识，我们还需要用到朗基努斯之枪……”他话音渐弱，脸上突然布满阴云，“这不太妙。”

"What?" Rei asked. "什么？" 丽问道。

"Unit D hasn't awakened yet."  
"D 单位还没觉醒。"

"Son of a bitch!" Unit D held back one of the EVAs while it snapped its neck wildly with the lower hands, while at the same time Shinji used the upper hands, blocking the attack from another one. Asuka then grabbed its head and began pulling in the opposite direction of Shinji. The EVA was torn in half and fell lifelessly on the ground.  
"该死的！" D 单位一边用下方的手阻止一台 EVA 疯狂扭动脖子，一边同时让真嗣用上方的手挡住另一台 EVA 的攻击。随后，明日香抓住它的头，开始向与真嗣相反的方向拉扯。EVA 被撕成两半，无力地倒在地上。

Both of their cores were destroyed then.  
那时，他们两人的核心都被摧毁了。

The third and fourth Mass-Produced Evangelions bum-rushed her whilst swinging their great blades. The purple-crimson mech leaped upwards, shooting itself high above its opponents before crashing both feet down onto the skull of the one to its left, digging its heels into it after forcing it to the ground. Unit D then spun in place like a ballerina on point, digging its left foot even further into the cranium of the downed EVA, drilling a hole through its head while the pilots delivered a spinning roundhouse kick to the one still standing on its feet, knocking it back. Taking its blade from the MP EVA, Unit D threw it at another incoming EVA, piercing through its core right away. Looking down at its feet, Unit D finished off the MP EVA under its left foot with a hard step on the core, and turned to the other EVA that just regained its composure, with another EVA approaching.  
第三和第四台量产型福音战士挥舞着巨大的刀刃向她猛冲过来。紫红色的机体一跃而起，射向高空，越过对手后，双足猛地踩在左侧那台的颅骨上，落地后将脚跟深深嵌入其中。D 型机随后如芭蕾舞者般旋转，左脚更深地刺入倒地福音战士的头颅，钻穿其头部，同时驾驶员对仍站立的那台发动旋转回旋踢，将其击退。D 型机从量产型福音战士手中夺过刀刃，掷向另一台逼近的福音战士，立刻贯穿其核心。低头看向脚下，D 型机用力踩碎左脚下那台的核心，转身面对刚刚恢复镇定和另一台逼近的福音战士。

Seeing how close both of them were in proximity to each other, Shinji and Asuka brought Unit D down into a kneeling position and opened up the tops of its right shoulder pylon, shooting giant titanium spikes out from it, ripping right through the heads and upper torsos of both EVAs. LCL spewed from their wounds as they both bellowed in pain before limply toppling over and crashing to the ground, shaking the entire GeoFront upon landing.  
看到两人如此接近，真嗣和明日香操控 Unit D 跪下，并打开其右肩塔顶部的装置，从中射出巨大的钛合金尖刺，直接贯穿了两台 EVA 的头颅和上半身。LCL 从他们的伤口中喷涌而出，伴随着痛苦的咆哮，他们无力地倒下，撞击地面时整个 GeoFront 都为之震动。

After destroying their cores, both Shinji and Asuka snorted, "Only Four to go." They could feel the bloodlust coursing through her veins as she turned to face the remaining MP EVAs. Asuka sneered,  
摧毁了核心后，真嗣和明日香不屑地哼了一声，“还剩四个。”他们能感受到她血管中涌动的杀意，当她转向剩下的 MP EVA 时，明日香冷笑道，

delivering a hard blow to the abdomen of the Fourth-to-last MP EVA,  
对倒数第四台 MP EVA 的腹部狠狠一击，

ripping Unit D's lower right fist through the guts of its opponent, spilling out its intestine onto the ground, staining the artificial grass red as the LCL gushed onto it. It writhed in pain and anguish while the purple-crimson mech dug its hand further into it, coming out of its back, ripping straight through its spine, gripping onto its core. Shinji helped her using the upper hands, nipping the core with tremendous force.  
将 D 型机的右下拳猛地撕裂对手的腹部，肠子洒落一地，人造草坪被 LCL 染成红色。那机体痛苦地扭动着，而紫红色的机甲将手更深地插入，从背部穿出，直击脊椎，紧握其核心。真嗣用上方的手协助她，以巨大的力量咬住核心。

With the sheer amount of adrenaline surging through their bodies, both pilots only had one thought on their minds.  
随着体内汹涌的肾上腺素，两位驾驶员心中只有一个念头。

'I'll kill you.' '我要杀了你。'

"Oh my God, Shinji and Asuka's sync ratio has increased to eight- hundred percent!" Maya cried out in panic.  
“天哪，真嗣和明日香的同步率已经上升到八百个百分点了！” 玛雅惊慌失措地喊道。

Unit D's eyes lit up; wings of light expanded from its back. The MP EVA's core exploded under thousands of tons of force.  
D 型机的眼睛亮了起来；光之翼从其背部展开。MP 型 EVA 的核心在数千吨的力量下爆炸了。

Kaworu looked up as the ground shook, a smile appeared on his face. "She's finally awakened." His smile disappeared as quickly, "That also means Shinji and Asuka might be in danger right now. Lilith, you need to make your decision."  
渚薰抬头看着地面震动，脸上露出了微笑。“她终于觉醒了。” 他的笑容转瞬即逝，“这也意味着真嗣和明日香现在可能处于危险之中。莉莉丝，你需要做出决定了。”

Rei closed her eyes, immersed in her thoughts. She didn't want Shinji to be near anything EVA-related ever again. "You said we can go back as far as before the Second Impact… I am assuming you mean it won't happen again. Or the there's no purpose of doing it."  
丽闭上眼睛，沉浸在自己的思绪中。她不希望真嗣再与任何与 EVA 相关的事物有牵扯。“你说我们可以回到第二次冲击之前……我假设你指的是它不会再发生。或者这样做没有意义。”

Kaworu shook his head gently, "It might still happen, but at least Shinji and Asuka are out of it, correct? Isn't that more than enough?"  
薰轻轻摇头，“它仍有可能发生，但至少真嗣和明日香脱离了这一切，对吧？这难道还不够吗？”

"How can you be so sure? We do not even know if they'll survive using them as the energy source of recreating the new world," Rei said coldly.  
“你怎么能如此确定？我们甚至不知道他们作为重建新世界的能源来源是否能存活，”丽冷冷地说道。

"But it's our best shot, is it not?"  
"但这已是我们的最佳机会，不是吗？"

Rei thought about it again carefully. It was simple, only two choices were presented to her, but at the same time, it was the hardest choice she had to make ever. In comparison betraying Gendo was a much easier one.  
丽再次仔细思考这个问题。选择很简单，只有两个选项摆在她的面前，但同时，这也是她不得不做出的最艰难的决定。相比之下，背叛源堂显得容易多了。

She knew what Kaworu said was true - humans will fight with each other using the EVAs. It was a dead-end, no matter what. She also realized that she could abort Instrumentality at any time she wanted. The best choice would be to initiate Instrumentality, and ask what Shinji and Asuka wanted.  
她知道渚薰所言非虚——人类会利用 EVA 彼此争斗。这是一条死胡同，无论如何。她也意识到自己随时可以终止人类补完计划。最佳的选择是启动补完计划，并询问真嗣和明日香的想法。

Rei let out a breath she had been holding too long, "I shall proceed as you instruct."  
丽长长地呼出一口气，她憋得太久了，“我将按照您的指示行事。”

The three remaining MP EVAs formed a formation around the ascending Unit D, all of them carried a replica of the Lance of Longinus. One of the MP EVAs aimed at Unit D's left hand and threw the Lance at it, trying to impale the purple-crimson behemoth.  
剩下的三台 MP EVA 围绕着正在上升的 D 型单位形成阵型，每台都携带着朗基努斯之枪的复制品。其中一台 MP EVA 瞄准了 D 型单位的左手，投掷出长枪，试图刺穿那紫红色的巨兽。

Just to be knocked aside by another Lance.  
却被另一支长枪击飞。

Shinji and Asuka blinked in surprise, as Misato's voice sounded in the comm channel, "Shinji, Asuka! The Lance of Longinus moved on its own! Take it!"  
真嗣和明日香惊讶地眨了眨眼，通讯频道中传来美里的话音，“真嗣，明日香！朗基努斯之枪自己动了！快拿住它！”

"The _real_ Lance?" The pilots said in unison, taking a strong grip of the Lance.  
“真正的朗基努斯之枪？”两位驾驶员异口同声地说道，紧紧握住了长枪。

"Correct, now kill those bastards!"  
“没错，现在干掉那些混蛋！”

"Roger." Shinji and Asuka smiled, "why didn't we take it at the beginning of the fight?" Asuka mocked.  
“罗杰。” 真嗣和明日香微笑着，“为什么我们不在战斗一开始就使用它呢？” 明日香嘲讽道。

"Hmmm… we are stupid?" "Hmph. Now focus on the fight!"  
“嗯……我们真蠢？” “哼。现在专注于战斗吧！”

Unit D expanded its wing of light, and flew toward the weaponless MP EVA Unit. It tried to escape, but Unit D's mobility was far better than the subpar MP models. The Lance pierced through its core effortlessly. Another MP EVA charged toward Unit D, wielding the replica of Lance. Unit D pulled its Lance out of the MP EVA; with a vicious swing, two Lance clashed head-on, and the fake Lance broke in half. "Ha! Fake is fake!" Asuka exclaimed.  
D 型机展开了它的光之翼，向着失去武器的 MP EVA 单位飞去。它试图逃脱，但 D 型机的机动性远超那些劣质的 MP 型号。长矛轻松贯穿了它的核心。另一台 MP EVA 手持复制品长矛冲向 D 型机，D 型机从 MP EVA 中抽出长矛；猛力一挥，两柄长矛正面相撞，仿制长矛应声断裂。“哈！假的终究是假的！” 明日香喊道。

Finishing it off with ease, Unit D turned to the last active MP EVA.  
轻松完成任务后，D 单位转向了最后一个活跃的量产型 EVA。

"Let me handle this, Shinji." Asuka said, "unless… you also want to enjoy it."  
“让我来处理这个，真嗣。”明日香说道，“除非……你也想享受一下。”

Shinji closed his eyes, feeling his anger rising as he once again recalled Asuka's painful scream when her Unit 02 was torn apart by the MP EVAs. "I'll do it with you, Asuka." He said firmly, taking a deep breath, "I'll make it suffer… for what they had done to you."  
真嗣闭上眼睛，想起明日香的二号机被量产型 EVA 撕裂时她痛苦的尖叫，怒火中烧。“我和你一起，明日香。”他坚定地说，深吸一口气，“我要让它为对你所做的一切付出代价。”

"All MP EVAs are eliminated!" Maya reported happily, "no energy spikes detec… wait."  
"所有 MP EVA 均已消灭！" 真耶高兴地报告，"没有能量峰值检测……等等。"

"What? What happened?" Misato asked.  
"什么？发生了什么？" 美里问道。"

"Pattern Blue!" Makoto yelled as the klaxons sounded again, "It's… no it's not an Angel, it's a human!"  
"蓝色模式！" 真喊道，随着警报再次响起，"这是……不，不是使徒，是人！"

As the technicians were still trying to figure out what was happening, a giant white Rei Ayanami emerged from the bottom of the command deck, passing through everything like they weren't there. People watched in awe as the figure ascended, reaching for Unit D.  
当技术人员还在努力弄清楚发生了什么时，一个巨大的白色绫波零从指挥甲板的底部出现，仿佛穿过虚无一般穿过一切。人们惊叹地看着这个身影升起，伸手去够 D 型机。

"It's happening again… just like fifteen years ago," Maya said as she saw the readings on her terminal, "Is this the answer I was looking for?"  
“又发生了……就像十五年前一样，”玛雅看着终端上的读数说道，“这就是我一直在寻找的答案吗？”

Outside in the GeoFront, Shinji and Asuka were also stunned to see Lilith reaching for them. Their first thoughts were somehow Rei  
在 GeoFront 的外面，真嗣和明日香也被莉莉丝伸手向他们的一幕惊呆了。他们的第一反应不知为何是绫波

betrayed them and chose to help Gendo to start Third Impact, but the thoughts were quickly squashed as they knew Lilith wouldn't be reaching for them if Rei really chose Gendo. So instead they waited.  
背叛了他们，选择帮助源堂启动第三次冲击，但这个念头很快就被打消了，因为他们知道如果绫波真的选择了源堂，莉莉丝是不会向他们伸手的。于是他们只能等待。

And that proved to be a good choice.  
而这一决定被证明是明智的。

Shinji and Asuka slowly opened their eyes, found themselves floating in space. Standing in front of them were Rei Ayanami and Kaworu Nagisa.  
真嗣和明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己正漂浮在太空中。站在他们面前的是绫波零和渚薰。

"Rei! Kaworu!" Shinji said, panicking, "What is this place? Did Instrumentality happen again?"  
“丽！薰！”真嗣惊慌地说，“这是哪里？难道人类补完计划又发生了？”

"No. This is a small Instrumentality only between the four of us. And I'm not Kaworu the Seventeenth Angel. I'm Adam."  
“不。这只是我们四人之间的小规模补完。而且我不是第十七使徒薰。我是亚当。”

"I am Lilith." Rei said.  
“我是莉莉丝。”丽说道。

Asuka swallowed, "So… I guess you have a reason to bring us here, right?"  
明日香咽了咽口水，“所以……我想你带我们来这里是有原因的，对吧？”

"Indeed. We're here to offer you a choice." Kaworu smirked, "The fate of the world depends on you, Shinji and Asuka."  
“确实如此。我们来这里是为了给你们一个选择。”渚薰微微一笑，“世界的命运取决于你，真嗣和明日香。”

"Yeah, whatever. What are the choices, though?"  
“是啊，随便吧。不过，选择是什么？”

"It all depends on what your heart wishes for," Rei said, "we simply listen to your wishes."  
"一切都取决于你心中所愿，"丽说，"我们只是聆听你的愿望。"

"But what can I wish for if I don't know what are the choices?" Shinji asked, confused, "or can I just wish for whatever I want?"  
"但如果我不知道有哪些选择，我能许什么愿呢？"真嗣困惑地问，"还是说我可以随心所欲地许愿？"

"That is correct." "没错。"

"Okay… so, I want to abort Instrumentality." Shinji said, turning to look at Asuka, who gave him a nod.  
“好吧……那么，我想终止人类补完计划。”真嗣说道，转向看着明日香，她向他点了点头。

"That is acceptable, but I must warn you," Kaworu said, "after this, the world will still have Evangelion technologies. Humans are never  
“这可以接受，但我必须警告你，”渚薰说，“即便如此，世界仍将保留 EVA 技术。人类本不该拥有如此力量；因此，唯一的结果将是使用 EVA 进行的战争。”

meant to possess such power; thus, the only outcome would be wars fought using EVAs."  
“这意味着，人类本不该拥有这样的力量；因此，唯一的结果将是使用 EVA 进行的战争。”

"Does that mean… Asuka and I will be fighting against other EVAs, piloted by other humans?"  
"那是不是意味着…我和明日香将要与其他由人类驾驶的 EVA 战斗？"

"Most likely." "很有可能。"

"If that's the case… then I want a world without Evangelions."  
"如果真是那样…那我想要一个没有 EVA 的世界。"

"There's only one way of doing this," Kaworu smiled as Shinji made the right choice, "reversing the time."  
"只有一种方法可以做到这一点，" 渚薰微笑着，看着真嗣做出了正确的选择，"那就是逆转时间。"

"Huh? But I thought you said it's impossible."  
"嗯？但你不说过这是不可能的吗？"

"It is, but what I'm suggesting is different. We can recreate a new world without Second Impact happening. To do this, your powers will be needed as well." Kaworu said as he pointed his fingers at Shinji and Asuka, "Lilith and I won't be able to provide the energy required. But with your help, it is feasible."  
"确实如此，但我提议的是另一种方法。我们可以创造一个没有第二次冲击发生的新世界。为此，你的力量也是必要的。" 渚薰说着，用手指向真嗣和明日香，"莉莉丝和我无法提供所需的能量。但有了你们的帮助，这是可行的。"

"What will happen to us, then?" Asuka asked. "You two will become Gods."  
"那我们将会怎样？" 明日香问道。"你们两位将会成为神。"

"WHAT?" They both shouted.  
"什么？" 他们齐声惊呼。

Kaworu chuckled, "akin to us, you can live without needing a physical body. Actually, right now, your physical bodies have already ceased to exist since both of you have over four hundred percent of sync ratio with the EVA."  
渚薰轻笑道："类似于我们，你们可以不需要肉体而生存。实际上，现在你们的肉体已经不复存在，因为你们与 EVA 的同步率都超过了四百个百分点。"

"What about Second Impact though? It may still happen, right?" "Maybe, maybe not. But that is not your concern."  
"那第二次冲击呢？它可能还是会发生，对吧？" "或许会，或许不会。但这不是你该操心的事。"

"But the new world may still have us in them!"  
"但新世界可能依然有我们的位置！"

"And I want all the details first!" Asuka said, "what's the world gonna  
"我得先知道所有细节！" 明日香说，"这个世界将会怎样

look like?" 看起来像什么？

"We… don't exactly know, but the world will be relatively the same. The only major difference would be the absence of Second Impact, and everything, including people's memories, will change accordingly. Try to visualize what the world would look like in 2015 if Second Impact didn't happen in 2000?"  
我们…并不完全清楚，但世界大体上会保持不变。唯一的主要区别是没有第二次冲击，所有事物，包括人们的记忆，都会相应改变。试着想象一下，如果 2000 年没有发生第二次冲击，2015 年的世界会是什么样子？

"A world… where Asuka and I go to school like normal teenagers?" "We don't even know if you would exist in that world in the first  
一个…我和明日香像普通青少年一样上学的世界？" "我们甚至不知道在那个世界里你是否会存在。

place," Kaworu said, "but this can give you some insight."  
地方，" 渚薰说，"但这能给你一些启示。"

Shinji and Asuka fell silent. The choices were laid down in front of them. They could either abort Instrumentality and face a post-Angel wars world where superpowers would want to use EVAs as military, reset the world and start another cycle, or accept Adam and Lilith's offer.  
真嗣和明日香陷入了沉默。摆在面前的是几个选择：要么终止人类补完计划，面对一个后使徒战争的世界，超级大国可能会将 EVA 用于军事；要么重置世界，开始新一轮循环；或者接受亚当和莉莉丝的提议。

_'I don't want to pilot an EVA ever again, but Asuka may want to. There's no way I can leave her to fight alone. And I don't want to hurt other people. As for creating a new world… I wonder if it will do anything. Second Impact may still happen, just not in 2000. Maybe the world will go on for another cycle, with different people suffering, different people to pilot… and the whole becoming G  od thing… at least I can be with Asuka forever, not so bad, eh?'  
'我再也不想驾驶 EVA 了，但明日香可能还想。我不能让她独自战斗。我也不想伤害其他人。至于创造一个新世界……我不知道这会有什么用。第二次冲击可能仍会发生，只是不在 2000 年。也许世界会继续循环，不同的人受苦，不同的人驾驶……而成为神这件事……至少我可以永远和明日香在一起，不算太糟，对吧？'_

_'I mean, becoming a G  od certainly sounds alluring, and this way I can literally be with Shinji forever, but what about people in this new world? Shinji and I were both born around 2001, that means even if we exist in the new world, we won't become EVA pilots since only children born after the Second Impact can pilot the EVAs. Maybe we can finally be excused from the responsibility of saving the world, after all we've been through.'  
'我的意思是，成为神听起来确实诱人，这样我就能永远和真嗣在一起了，但这个新世界的人们怎么办？我和真嗣都是 2001 年左右出生的，这意味着即使我们存在于新世界，也不会成为 EVA 驾驶员，因为只有第二次冲击后出生的孩子才能驾驶 EVA。也许我们终于可以免除拯救世界的责任了，毕竟我们经历了那么多。'_

Both Shinji and Asuka turned to look at each other, determination in  
真嗣和明日香转头看向对方，眼中充满了决心。

their eyes. Although they both didn't like the idea of the possibility of  
尽管他们都不喜欢这种可能性，

Second Impact happening again in the new world, but compared to the other options, this one carried the most hope. They both nodded, "We accept your offer."  
第二次冲击在新世界再次发生，但与其他选项相比，这一选择承载着最多的希望。他们两人点头，“我们接受你的提议。”

In the real world, everyone on the command deck watched in awe as Unit D turned into a bright white giant with the Lance of Longinus in its hands, a halo appearing above its head. Lilith held the ascending Unit D in her hands; giant white wings spread behind her body. The whole world was covered in brightness as Lilith, Adam, Shinji, and Asuka's S2 engines overloaded, turning the world into an unknown direction.  
在现实世界中，指挥甲板上的人们惊叹地看着 D 型机化作一个手持朗基努斯之枪的明亮白色巨人，头顶出现光环。莉莉丝将升空的 D 型机托在手中；巨大的白色翅膀在她身后展开。随着莉莉丝、亚当、真嗣和明日香 S2 引擎的超载，整个世界被光芒笼罩，转向未知方向。

我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。

**Chapter 17 : After**

Under the cerulean sky and scattered clouds, two human silhouettes laid on the beach aside from the blue ocean. One of them wearing a yellow sundress, a violet choker, and two red bead-shaped hair clips; the other wearing a school uniform with white shirt and black trousers. The cool breeze of the sea wind gently blew across the two of them. The girl with yellow sundress stirred, opening her eyes slowly.  
在蔚蓝的天空和零星的云朵下，除了蓝色的大海，海滩上躺着两个人类的剪影。其中一个穿着黄色太阳裙，戴着紫色项圈和两个红色珠形发夹；另一个穿着校服，白衬衫黑裤子。海风的凉爽轻轻吹拂着她们。穿黄色太阳裙的女孩动了动，慢慢睁开了眼睛。

Saying she was confused would be a heavy understatement.  
说她感到困惑，那简直是轻描淡写。

The last thing she remembered was the ride on _Over the Rainbow_, and the next second she was here. Looking to her left, she saw something even more strange.  
她最后记得的是乘坐《飞越彩虹》，下一秒她就在这里了。向左看去，她发现了一些更加奇怪的东西。

Two people, one in a red plug suit she recognized as hers, and another in white and bule plug suit. She blinked, and the two of them disappeared.  
两个人，一个穿着她认出是自己的红色插件服，另一个穿着白色和蓝色的插件服。她眨了眨眼，那两个人就消失了。

_'Was that… me?' '那是……我吗？'_

Looking to her right, she saw a boy with dark-brown hair laying aside her, presumably sleeping.  
她向右看去，只见一个深棕色头发的男孩躺在她旁边，大概是在睡觉。

Suddenly anger surged through her body. She just woke up on a beach, having no memory of how she got here, and laying aside a BOY she didn't recognize. The only logical explanation she could  
突然，愤怒涌遍她的全身。她刚刚在海滩上醒来，完全不记得自己是怎么来到这里的，旁边还躺着一个她不认识的男孩。她此刻唯一能想到的合理解释就是，这个男孩不知怎么地绑架了她。

come up with at the moment was the boy somehow abducted her

and took her here - she didn't dare to think what he might have done with her. Nothing appropriate she could think of.  
并将她带到了这里——她不敢去想他可能对她做了什么。她能想到的没有一件是合适的。

Before she could even realize she found her hands already clasping around the boy's throat. She tightened her grip, and the boy finally opened his eyes. She saw confusion, panic, fear, pain - and oxygen deprivation in his eyes.  
在她意识到之前，她的双手已经紧紧掐住了男孩的脖子。她加大了力度，男孩终于睁开了眼睛。她看到了困惑、恐慌、恐惧、痛苦——还有他眼中的缺氧。

She didn't think rationally. All she had in her mind was, 'I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.'  
她没有理性思考。她脑海中只有一个念头：'我要杀了你。我要杀了你。我要杀了你。'

Suddenly she felt warmth on her left cheek. She found herself being caressed by the boy. Her mind was screaming to her to keep going, but there was an unspoken familiarity of the caress, and her body reacted on its own. She loosened her grip, allowing the boy to breathe.  
突然间，她感到左脸颊传来一阵温暖。发现自己正被那男孩轻抚着。她的内心在大声疾呼要继续下去，但那抚摸中却有一种不言而喻的熟悉感，她的身体不由自主地做出了反应。她松开了紧握的手，让男孩得以呼吸。

The boy panted heavily, trying to get as much oxygen as possible.  
男孩大口喘息，尽可能多地吸入氧气。

"How disgusting…" She murmured, "why is my body reacting this way?"  
“真恶心……”她低声自语，“为什么我的身体会有这样的反应？”

"I'm sorry… but, hmm, could you please get off me?" The boy suddenly spoke after a few seconds of heavy panting.  
“对不起……但是，嗯，你能从我身上下来吗？”男孩在几秒钟的沉重喘息后突然开口说道。

To her surprise, she immediately complied and rolled off his body, but she kept her death-glare directed at him. She could still see the fear in the boy's eyes, much to her satisfaction.  
令她惊讶的是，她立刻照做了，从他身上滚了下来，但她的死亡凝视仍然直直地对着他。她仍然能看到男孩眼中的恐惧，这让她颇为满意。

SLAP

The boy rubbed his red cheek in surprise, "Hey! What was that for?"  
男孩惊讶地揉着发红的脸颊，“嘿！这是为什么？”

"What do you think, dummkopf?" She yelled, "who the fuck are you and where the fuck are we?"  
"你觉得呢，傻瓜？" 她大喊，"你他妈是谁，我们他妈的在哪儿？"

Her words were a cue for him as the boy quickly looked around, a confused frown appeared on his face. "I… don't know?"  
她的话成了他的信号，男孩迅速环顾四周，脸上浮现出困惑的皱眉。"我……不知道？"

"Don't bullshit me, asshole! You took me here and must've raped me! I should've killed you just then!" She said as she once again leaped forward, pinning the boy on the beach, "Speak what you know, or I'll kill you right now!"  
"别跟我胡扯，混蛋！是你把我带到这里来的，肯定还强奸了我！我刚才就该杀了你！" 她说着再次扑向前，将男孩按在沙滩上，"说你知道的，否则我现在就杀了你！"

"Wha-what? What are you talking about? I-what?" The boy panicked, "hey, I just woke up here with you strangling me! It's more like you wanted to rape me, not me you!"  
"什-什么？你在说什么？我-什么？" 男孩慌了，"嘿，我刚醒来就发现你掐着我！更像是你要强暴我，而不是我对你！"

She didn't want to believe it, but her mind was telling her that he was telling the truth. So she slapped him again and stood up. "Then what do you remember?"  
她不想相信，但她的内心告诉她他说的是真的。于是她又扇了他一巴掌，站了起来。"那你记得什么？"

"why should I tell you? I can't trust someone who tried to kill me!"  
"我为什么要告诉你？我不能信任一个试图杀我的人！"

"Listen, I don't give a shit about your trust, I only care about what happened to me!" She shouted, "okay, I'll tell you my story. I was on a ship, and the next second I woke up here! You laying aside me!" She took a deep breath, "and you blame _me_ for trying to kill you?"  
"听着，我不在乎你的信任，我只关心我经历了什么！" 她喊道，"好吧，我告诉你我的故事。我在一艘船上，下一秒我就醒在这里！你躺在我旁边！" 她深吸一口气，"而你却怪我试图杀你？"

The boy gulped, "I… sorry. But I can say I have a similar experience as you. I was on a helicopter… and the next second I woke up here, you strangling me."  
男孩咽了口唾沫，"我……对不起。但我可以说我和你有类似的经历。我原本在直升机上……下一秒我就醒在这里，你正掐着我。"

"What? How is that possible?" She said, "You are not suggesting that we both got drugged and dropped here, are you?"  
"什么？这怎么可能？" 她说，"你不是在暗示我们俩都被下了药然后扔到这里吧？"

"I… don't know?" He frowned, "how can I know something like that?"  
"我…不知道？" 他皱眉，"我怎么可能知道这种事？"

She closed her eyes, trying to think rationally. Damn, she had a college degree! The last thing she wanted to do now was to let emotions, not logic, guide her actions. Normally she didn't exactly put effort into controlling her temper, but under stressful situations like this, she needed to think.  
她闭上眼睛，试图理性思考。该死，她可是有大学学位的！现在最不想做的就是让情绪而非逻辑主导行动。通常她并不刻意控制自己的脾气，但在这种压力情境下，她需要思考。

_'If we ARE both drugged and sent here, there must be some common features among us. Might as well ask him a few q uestions. But I need to make the first step, considering I did try to kill him.'_ She  
'如果我们都被下了药送到这里，我们之间一定有某些共同点。不妨问问他几个问题。但考虑到我曾试图杀他，我需要迈出第一步。' 她

thought. Turning to look at the very confused boy, she spoke.  
心想。她转头看向那个一脸困惑的男孩，开口说道。

"Asuka."

"Huh?"

"My name, Asuka! Are you stupid or something?" Asuka sighed, "What's your name?"  
“我的名字，明日香！你是傻还是怎么的？”明日香叹了口气，“你叫什么名字？”

"Oh… sorry. I'm Shinji." "Hmmm… sounds like a Baka."  
“哦……抱歉。我叫真嗣。”“嗯……听起来像个笨蛋。”

### Epilogue

"Asuka, there is a problem."  
"明日香，出问题了。"

"Can it wait? I'm trying not to have too much fun dissecting Z eruel here."  
"能等会儿吗？我正努力不让自己在解剖第 10 使徒时玩得太开心。"

"Asuka, you know it's just a reality we created."  
"明日香，你知道这只是我们创造的现实。"

"C'mon, being a God certainly grants you some privilege." "Still, we have a more pressing matter at hand!"  
"拜托，身为神明当然有些特权。" "不过，我们手头还有更紧迫的事情要处理！"

"Gott, you're pretty pathetic being a God, you know that?"  
"天哪，你作为神明也太可悲了吧，知道吗？"

Asuka sighed and stopped tearing Z eruel apart. The world around her paused as she thought. Turning around to Shinji, she asked, "What now, darling?"  
明日香叹了口气，停止了对 Zeruel 的撕扯。周围的世界在她思考时静止了。她转身面对真嗣，问道："现在怎么办，亲爱的？"

"We were left on earth." "What do you mean by 'we'?"  
"我们被留在了地球上。" "你说的'我们'是指什么？"

"Hmmm… our… the original us in this world?"  
"嗯……我们的……这个世界的原版我们？"

Asuka blinked, "You mean… the Shinji and Asuka in this world… before we came here?"  
明日香眨了眨眼，"你是说……这个世界的真嗣和我……在我们来到这里之前？"

"Precisely." "确实如此。"

"Scheiß e. Do they… remember anything?" "Not likely. That Asuka… just strangled me."  
"该死。他们……记得什么吗？"" ""不太可能。那个明日香……刚刚勒死我了。"

"Oh fuck. Did I… kill you?"  
"哦，该死。我……杀了你吗？"

"No. I caressed your face, and you stopped." "Great, what do we do… about them?"  
"不，我抚摸了你的脸，你就停下了。""太好了，我们该怎么办……关于他们？"

Shinji sighed, "I thought about… leaving the world as it be. But now seeing _us_ in there… I can't just…"  
真嗣叹了口气，""我曾想过……让世界保持原样。但现在看到我们在那里……我不能就这样……""

"Me neither. We need to do something."  
"我也是。我们需要做些什么。""

"But our powers… we can't physically interfere with the world!"  
"但我们的力量…我们无法直接干涉这个世界！"

"But we can interact with our… counterparts, right? We can act as guides; we need to guide our counterparts to prevent the Second Impact!"  
"但我们能与我们的…对应体互动，对吧？我们可以充当向导；我们需要引导我们的对应体，以防止第二次冲击！"

"Sounds like a plan to me."  
"听起来是个计划。"

"But how do we do it, to be specific? And… speaking of our counterparts, do they still have S2 organs, since they… possess _our_ former bodies?"  
"但具体该怎么做呢？而且……说到我们的对应体，既然他们……拥有我们以前的身体，那他们还有 S2 机关吗？"

"Yes, they do, but they are completely dormant, I guess it's because since Second Impact hasn't happened yet, S2 organs are also deactivated."  
"是的，他们有，但我认为是完全休眠的，可能是因为第二次冲击尚未发生，S2 机关也因此处于未激活状态。"

"Now the problem solved itself then. I mean, as soon as Second Impact happens, their S2 organs will activate, right? Then they still have potential to prevent it without EVAs, or at least stop it."  
"那么问题就自行解决了。我是说，一旦第二次冲击发生，他们的 S2 机关就会激活，对吧？那样他们仍有潜力在不使用 EVA 的情况下阻止它，或者至少停止它。"

"I guess you are right."  
"我想你是对的。"

Without another word, the two teenage Gods discarded the fake reality they created for entertainment, and once more returned to the world they once left.  
没有再多说一句话，两位年轻的神祇抛弃了他们为娱乐而创造的虚假现实，再次回到了他们曾经离开的世界。
