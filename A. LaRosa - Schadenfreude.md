It's been a while, Evangelion. This was written for a drabble prompt meme on LiveJournal, and I felt like I should post it here for the hell of it. Review if you feel like it. I'd appreciate it.

**Schadenfreude 幸灾乐祸**

Stepping into the empty elevator, she allowed him no time to prepare himself as she all but assaulted him, pushing him up against the wall as the doors shut in their wake, her lips strong against his.  
她走进空无一人的电梯，没给他任何准备的时间，几乎是以攻击的方式将他推到墙上，电梯门在他们身后关闭，她的唇坚定地压在他的唇上。

The elevator didn't move. Not without instruction, at least. Between small kisses, Asuka mashed her hand up against the buttons, knowing the general area of the floor they needed to get off at to be at Misato's apartment, and just hoped for the best. She had made her way up to that apartment God knows how many times, and even lived there, so she should know by now.  
电梯没有动。至少在没有指令之前是这样。在小吻之间，Asuka 用手猛按按钮，知道大致需要到达 Misato 公寓的楼层区域，只是希望一切顺利。她不知道已经去过那个公寓多少次，甚至在那里住过，所以现在应该已经熟悉了。

Opening an eye to make sure, she noticed that she had pressed more than needed to be pushed in the first place. Asuka dismissed the thought, figuring she would have a little more fun than she originally had planned. He was content with the ambush, on the other hand, his hands wandering down her back as she brought herself closer to him.  
睁开一只眼确认，她发现自己按得比原本需要的多。明日香打消了这个念头，心想她会比原计划多玩一会儿。另一方面，他对于这场伏击感到满意，双手在她贴近他时游走在她的背上。

She fisted the front of Shinji's button-up shirt as she deepened the kiss. He tried to gain some sort of dominance, leaning her back, but she would have none of that. With an extra shove, his back 'thumped' against the metallic wall. A small groan manifested in the back of his throat, but she ignored it as the kiss continued on as they rose from floor to floor. They were never like this in public, with anyone around. They were private people, and even though Asuka knew that she loved the idiot, she wasn't comfortable with her love life on display. Who knew who was watching?  
她紧握住真嗣的衬衫前襟，加深了这个吻。他试图夺取某种主导权，将她向后倾，但她毫不让步。用力一推，他的背重重地撞上了金属墙壁。喉咙里发出一声低沉的呻吟，但她无视了，吻继续着，随着电梯一层层上升。他们在公共场合从未如此，周围有任何人时都不会。他们是注重隐私的人，尽管明日香知道她爱那个傻瓜，但她不习惯将自己的爱情生活公开展示。谁知道谁在看着呢？

She understood, however, the allure to elevators that she knew drew Misato in–especially when she was with the right person, mind you. That thought was easily pushed aside as the telltale 'ding!' of the elevator brought her back to her senses as it reached the first stop.  
然而，她理解电梯的吸引力，她知道这正是吸引美里——尤其是和合适的人在一起时。这个念头很容易被电梯到达第一层的标志性“叮！”声推到一边，让她恢复了理智。

Glancing at the lit number on the panel to make sure that it was, indeed, the wrong floor, she tugged Shinji off of the wall by his shirt and pushed him out of the elevator with a grin, just breaking the kiss when he was on the other side of the doors. Dazed and confused, as he was abruptly pulled from a very nice kiss, he felt like he was being thrown into ice water when he watched Asuka blow him a kiss with a wink as the doors shut in front of him. She was overly giddy at the look on his face. She always enjoyed keeping him on the edge. He was never comfortable for too long, and she made sure of it. Variety was the spice of life, no?  
瞥了一眼面板上亮起的楼层号，确认确实走错了楼层，她拽着真嗣的衬衫把他从墙边拉开，笑着将他推出电梯，就在他跨出门的那一刻结束了亲吻。突然从美好的亲吻中被拉扯出来，他感到自己仿佛被扔进了冰水中，眼看着明日香眨眼间向他飞吻，电梯门在他面前关闭。她对真嗣脸上的表情感到异常兴奋。她总是喜欢让他保持紧张状态。他从未能长时间感到舒适，而她确保了这一点。生活的调味品不就是变化吗？

"Dammit, Asuka," he hissed as he watched the numbers ascend in front of him, rolling his eyes at her behavior. He wondered why she had pushed her out and stayed on, but quickly realized her intentions when he saw that the floor was not the correct one they were supposed to be on, but a couple below it. Her actions didn't really surprise him anymore, though. Leave it to her to play games that literally left him out in the cold. It was winter, for Christ's sake! Give a guy a break, at least.  
“该死，明日香，”他低声咒骂，看着楼层数字上升，对她这种行为翻了个白眼。他不明白为什么她把自己推出去而自己却留在了里面，但很快意识到她的意图，当发现他们所在的楼层并非预定到达的那一层，而是低了几层。尽管如此，她的举动已经不再让他感到惊讶。她总是喜欢玩这种把他晾在一边的游戏。这可是冬天啊，看在上帝的份上！至少给个男人一点喘息的机会吧。

He began his ascent up the stairs at an excruciatingly slow pace; he knew that would piss her off that he didn't come running.  
他开始以一种极其缓慢的速度上楼；他知道这样会让她生气，因为他没有跑过去。

He must have been a masochist, with how eagerly he went back for more.  
他一定是个受虐狂，看他多么急切地回去找罪受。

He always went back for more.  
他总是回去寻求更多。
