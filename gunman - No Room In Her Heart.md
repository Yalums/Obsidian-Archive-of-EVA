Shinji was in the kitchen, just finishing up a new recipe he had found just the other day. He was so absorbed in his cooking that he didn't see or feel Misato sneak up behind him and hug him tightly.  
真嗣正在厨房里，刚刚完成前几天发现的一道新菜谱。他全神贯注于烹饪，以至于没有看到或感觉到美里悄悄走到他身后，紧紧地抱住了他。

"HI SHINJI!" She shouted as he glomped him from behind.  
"HI 真嗣！" 她从背后猛地抱住他，大声喊道。

"Geez, Misato! Are you trying to make me lose my hearing _and_ give me a heart attack?" he jumped.  
"天哪，美里！你是想让我失聪还心脏病发作吗？" 他吓得跳了起来。

"You really should learn to develop those instincts of yours, Shinji-kun!" the order woman said as she nuzzled her face against Shinji's affectionately. "So, where's Asuka?"  
"你真的应该学会培养你的直觉，真嗣君！" 这位指挥官一边说，一边亲昵地将脸贴在真嗣的脸上。"那么，明日香在哪里？"

"Out on another blind-date for Hikari. She'll probably dump the guy and be back here before the news comes on." he answered as Misato released him.  
“又是给光安排的相亲。她大概会把那人甩了，新闻还没播完就会回来。”他回答道，同时美里松开了他。

Misato grinned. "You know why she does that, don't you?" she asked, grabbing a beer from the fridge.  
美里咧嘴一笑。“你知道她为什么这么做，对吧？”她问道，从冰箱里拿了一瓶啤酒。

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

"Because she wants to be with you, silly-boy." she teased, yet again.  
“因为她想和你在一起，傻小子。”她再次打趣道。

Shinji nearly dropped his cooking pot at hearing that.  
听到这话，真嗣差点把手里的炒锅给摔了。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Asuka Langley Sohryu, the redheaded 'demon' from Germany, entered the apartment, grumbling all the way in. Her date had been a near disaster, for her, and she hoped that Hikari wouldn't go trying to set her up on another boring date. Granted the class rep was her best friend, but there was only so much a girl could put up with. Especially after all the cheap moves and tired lines he had tried to use on her. She was sorely tempted to find his address, get in her Eva the next time an Angel attacked, and toss the Angel onto his house.  
来自德国的红发'恶魔'惣流·明日香·兰格雷走进公寓，一路嘟囔着。她的约会几乎是一场灾难，她希望班长不要试图再给她安排另一个无聊的约会。虽然班长是她最好的朋友，但一个女孩能忍受的也就这么多。尤其是他试图用的那些廉价招数和陈词滥调。她真想找到他的地址，下次使徒来袭时，开着她的 Eva 把使徒扔到他家去。

She was about to announce her presence, when she heard raised voices from the kitchen.  
她正要宣布自己的到来，这时听到厨房里传来高声争吵。

"She likes you." she heard Misato say.  
“她喜欢你。”她听到美里说。

"No Way!" Shinji shouted back.  
"不可能！" 真嗣大声反驳道。

'_Huh?'_ Asuka's attention was caught.  
'嗯？' 明日香注意到了。

"There isn't any way what your saying is true." she heard Shinji again.  
"你说的那种事根本不可能发生。" 她再次听到真嗣的声音。

"Oh?" "哦？"

"Absolutely not!" "绝对不行！"

"I'm telling you, she does! 'Oh, Shinji, love of my life, be mine forever!'" she teased.  
"我跟你说，她真的会！‘哦，真嗣，我生命中的爱人，永远属于我！’"她打趣道。

Asuka was in the hallway now, approaching the kitchen. She was uncharacteristically curious about who Misato was talking about, if she heard her guardian right, someone liking Shinji. Of course, she hadn't heard of anyone from school, and she didn't think Rei had it in her to express those kinds of emotions. And it wasn't like he was particularly close to anyone at NERV. She would have popped in right there and asked exactly who would have liked Shinji, and then joined rubbing it in that no one in their right mind could possibly like him of all people, until she heard a familiar name.  
明日香此刻正走在走廊上，朝厨房走去。她出奇地好奇，想知道美里在谈论谁，如果她没听错的话，是有人喜欢真嗣。当然，她没听说学校里有这样的人，也不认为绫波会有表达那种情感的能力。而且，他在 NERV 里也不特别亲近谁。她本会立刻走进去，直接问是谁喜欢真嗣，然后加入嘲笑，说正常人都不可能喜欢他这种人，直到她听到一个熟悉的名字。

"Asuka hates me!" Shinji's voice echoed through the kitchen and into the hallway.  
“明日香讨厌我！”真嗣的声音在厨房里回荡，传到了走廊上。

The girl in question froze.  
当事人女孩僵住了。

"There isn't any way she could like me. She'd probably love to kill me."  
"她不可能喜欢我。她大概恨不得杀了我吧。"

His words dug into her heart.  
他的话深深刺痛了她的心。

"She doesn't hate you Shinji. She likes you. I know it."  
"她并不讨厌你，真嗣。她喜欢你。我知道的。"

"How could you know what Asuka's thinking? You're not psychic." A thought dawned on him. "Are you?" he asked, a little panicked.  
"你怎么可能知道明日香在想什么？你又不是通灵的。" 他突然灵光一闪。"难道你是？" 他有些慌张地问。

"I don't have to be. I can read between the lines. Asuka's always ditching those guys she goes on blind-dates with, so that she can rush back here and be with you."  
"我不需要通灵。我能从字里行间读出她的心思。明日香总是甩掉那些她去相亲的对象，就为了赶回这里和你在一起。"

"God, are you blind? You see the way she throws herself at Kaji." he let out a depressed sigh. "There isn't any room in her heart for me."  
"天啊，你瞎了吗？你没看到她对加持投怀送抱的样子。" 他沮丧地叹了口气。"她的心里根本没有我的位置。"

At this Asuka instantly rounded the corner ready to say something, but froze in her tracks at hearing his words. Not merely his words, but his tone as well. The Third's back was to her, and Misato was opposite him, chugging another beer. She ducked back around the corner to avoid being seen, but little did she know Misato saw her flash of red hair.  
听到这话，明日香立刻转过拐角，准备说些什么，却在听到他的话语时僵住了脚步。不仅仅是他的话，还有他的语气。第三适格者的背对着她，而美里正对着他，又灌下了一罐啤酒。她迅速退回拐角，以免被发现，但她不知道美里已经瞥见了她那一闪而过的红发。

"Maybe you're right, Shinji. Why should you waste time on an arrogant, selfish bitch like her."  
“也许你是对的，真嗣。你为什么要在一个像她那样傲慢自私的婊子身上浪费时间呢？”

At that, Asuka's anger started to rise. She would've instantly exploded into the kitchen to challenge the purple-haired woman, when she heard Shinji's voice.  
听到这里，明日香的怒火开始升腾。她本会立刻冲进厨房去挑战那个紫发女人，但这时她听到了真嗣的声音。

"She's not all bad, Misato."  
"她并不全是坏的，美里。"

At that, Asuka froze once again.  
听到这话，明日香再次僵住了。

"You're defending her?" a shocked Misato asked.  
"你在为她辩护？" 美里震惊地问道。

"She has her good points."  
"她有她的优点。"

"Such as..." she asked with a raised eyebrow.  
""比如……"" 她挑眉问道。

"Well, her confidence, for one. I kinda envy that about her."  
"嗯，她的自信，就是其中之一。我对她的这一点有点羡慕。"

Now it was Asuka's turn to be shocked.  
现在轮到明日香感到震惊了。

"You envy her confidence?"  
“你羡慕她的自信吗？”

"Yeah, I do. It's like, no matter what comes her way, she's confident she can handle it. Even when she can't. It's like nothing fazes her."  
“是的，我羡慕。就好像无论遇到什么，她都自信能应对。即使她做不到。似乎没有什么能让她动摇。”

"It sounds like you like her." Misato smiled.  
"听起来你好像喜欢她。" 美里微笑着说。

"I respect her. She's an EVA pilot, like me. Besides, she's smart, beautiful, confident, social. All the things I'm not. So why would she ever care about a guy like me?"  
"我尊重她。她和我一样是 EVA 驾驶员。而且，她聪明、美丽、自信、社交广泛。这些都是我所不具备的。那么，她为什么会看上我这样的人呢？"

"You're better than you think, Shinji."  
"你比你自己想的要好，真嗣。"

"No, I'm not. I know why Asuka doesn't like me."  
"不，我不是。我知道为什么明日香不喜欢我。"

"Oh? Why is that?" "哦？为什么呢？"

"Because I insult her." "因为我侮辱她。"

Misato looked stunned. "Since when? You've never said anything bad about her since you met."  
美里看起来惊呆了。“从什么时候开始的？自从你遇见她以来，你从未说过她一句坏话。”

"I don't mean verbally. I mean...the way I am offends her. I'm not like her, and that really bothers her."  
“我不是指言语上的。我是说...我的行为方式冒犯了她。我和她不一样，这真的让她很困扰。”

"But how does that prove she doesn't like you?"  
“但这怎么能证明她不喜欢你呢？”

"You remember the first day we met? She took one look at me and said, 'Not much to look at' and she seemed serious. She calls me 'baka' almost everyday, she called me a 'boring little boy' once. She's called me a jerk, pervert, moron, wimp and even an animated turnip." he said, counting on his fingers. He sighed. "Let's face it, there's no way she could ever like me."  
"你还记得我们第一次见面的那天吗？她看了我一眼就说，‘没什么好看的’，而且看起来很认真。她几乎每天都叫我‘笨蛋’，有一次还叫我‘无聊的小男孩’。她骂过我混蛋、变态、白痴、懦夫，甚至还有一次说我像个动画里的萝卜。" 他一边说一边掰着手指。他叹了口气。"面对现实吧，她不可能喜欢我的。"

"But you must like her if you remember every specific insult she ever threw at you." she said, pointedly.  
"但如果她每次骂你的话你都记得这么清楚，那你肯定是对她有意思。" 她直截了当地说。"

Shinji was quiet for several seconds, and the silence made Asuka nervous enough to risk peaking out around the doorway to look at him. Misato wasn't looking at her, but caught her out of the corner of her eye.  
真嗣沉默了几秒钟，这种沉默让明日香紧张到忍不住从门边探出头来看他。美里并没有在看她，但用眼角的余光捕捉到了她的动作。

"I guess I do. But she'll never like me back." he stated.  
"我想我是的。但她永远不会喜欢我。" 他断言道。

"You're so sure of that?"  
"你就这么肯定？"

"You've heard what she says. Every sentence is either a praise to Kaji, or an insult to me. 'Oh, Kaji's the only man for me, and you're not even worthy to lick my boots.'"  
"你听过她怎么说。每一句话要么是夸赞加持，要么是贬低我。'哦，加持才是我唯一的选择，你连舔我靴子的资格都没有。'"

At this Misato looked at him with a raised eyebrow.  
这时，美里挑起眉毛看着他。

"She doesn't have to say it, but I got the message." Shinji answered her silent query.  
“她不必说出口，但我已经明白了。”真嗣回答了她无声的疑问。

A tear started forming in Asuka's eyes. Misato saw the tear, and decided to push a couple more buttons. "But you love her, don't you?"  
一滴泪开始在明日香的眼中形成。美里看到了那滴泪，决定再按几下按钮。“但你爱她，不是吗？”

Shinji bowed his head for a few seconds, trying to hide his blush. "Yes, I do. But she'll never love me back. And I have to accept that."  
真嗣低下头几秒钟，试图掩饰自己的脸红。“是的，我喜欢她。但她永远不会爱我。我必须接受这一点。”

"So, you're just giving up?"  
“所以，你就这样放弃了？”

"How can I give up when I know she'll never give me a chance?"  
“既然我知道她永远不会给我机会，我又怎么能放弃呢？”

Asuka was in tears now, both for the truth she heard him confess, and the realization of how much of a bitch she has been to him.  
此刻的明日香泪流满面，既因听到了他坦白的真相，也因意识到自己对他有多么刻薄。

"You're absolutely right, Shinji. Why should you waste your time on an ungrateful bitch like Asuka? I mean, she hits you, insults you, blames you for her problems, doesn't appreciate anything you do, she doesn't show you any gratitude, especially after everything you've done for her. She didn't even thank you after you saved her life in that volcano. Heck, she doesn't even say 'thank you' period."  
“你说得完全正确，真嗣。你为什么要在一个像明日香这样不知感恩的婊子身上浪费时间呢？我是说，她打你，侮辱你，把她的麻烦归咎于你，不感激你做的任何事，从不对你表示感激，尤其是在你为她做了那么多之后。她在那次火山中你救了她一命后，甚至都没有感谢你。见鬼，她根本就不说‘谢谢’。”

In the hallway, Asuka turned the corner and placed her back to the wall, sliding down it to the floor where she cried silently. She then heard Shinji speak again.  
在走廊里，明日香转过拐角，背靠墙壁滑坐到地板上，默默地哭泣。随后，她又听到了真嗣的声音。

"I'm going to bed, Misato. Just leave everything here, I'll clean up in the morning."  
"我要去睡觉了，美里。东西就放这儿吧，我明早再收拾。"

"Alright, Shinji. Thank you!" Misato called out, knowing that Asuka still had to be in the hallway.  
""好的，真嗣。谢谢你！"" 美里喊道，她知道明日香还在走廊里。

Shinji turned the corner out of the kitchen and went to his room. He never noticed Asuka on the left side of the door, on the floor, as he turned right to his room, tears in her eyes as she watched him go.  
真嗣从厨房转角离开，走向自己的房间。他从未注意到明日香就在门左侧的地板上，当他向右转进自己的房间时，她泪眼朦胧地看着他离去。

_God dammit! I'm such a bitch!_ Asuka's mind screamed as more tears came. _He's been nothing but nice to me since I got here, and I treat him like shit!_  
该死！我真是个婊子！明日香的心里尖叫着，泪水再次涌出。自从我来到这里，他一直对我很好，而我却像对待垃圾一样对他！

Images of Shinji flashed through her mind, every event she had witnessed. Their first battle with an Angel, where he had been in the EVA 02 with her. She had to wonder, could she have won without Shinji being there? Considering her track record against the Angels thus far, the logical answer might have been 'no'. Her pride would have said 'yes', but now, she had to wonder. And yet Shinji had just said that he envied her confidence in battle. She never would have been able to defeat the 7th Angel without synchronizing her movements with him, and if it hadn't been for Shinji she wouldn't have been able to beat the 8th Angel hold up in that volcano.  
真嗣的影像在她脑海中闪过，每一个她目睹的事件。他们第一次与使徒的战斗，那时他和她一起在二号机里。她不禁想，如果没有真嗣在场，她能赢吗？考虑到迄今为止她对抗使徒的记录，逻辑上的答案可能是“不能”。她的自尊会说“能”，但现在，她不得不怀疑。然而真嗣刚刚说他羡慕她在战斗中的自信。没有与他同步动作，她永远不可能击败第七使徒，如果不是真嗣，她也无法打败藏在那座火山里的第八使徒。

_And he had actually dove in to that volcano to save me when the line snapped. And I didn't say 'thank you' to him. God, Misato's right, I really am an ungrateful bitch. It's no wonder he doesn't think I love him. I'm such a fool, thinking Kaji would be interested in me. I know he wouldn't have, but, I was always hopeful. A fools hope. Kaji will never like me the way I want, and Shinji...I've ruined any chance I have at being with him now. He loves me, but he's given up on me.  
当他真的跳进火山来救我，当绳子断裂时。而我却没有对他说‘谢谢’。天啊，美里说得对，我真是个不知感恩的婊子。难怪他认为我不爱他。我真是个傻瓜，以为加持会对我感兴趣。我知道他不会，但我总是抱有希望。一个傻瓜的希望。加持永远不会像我想要的那样喜欢我，而真嗣...我已经毁了和他在一起的任何机会。他爱我，但他已经放弃了我。_

Misato left the kitchen, passing Asuka, but not apparently not seeing her either. Once everyone had cleared out, Asuka got up off the floor and walked into the kitchen. She took a sharp knife from the drawer and sat down at the table. She took the seat where Misato had sat, across from where Shinji had sat. She held the knife to her left hand as tears continued to fall.  
美里离开了厨房，经过明日香，但显然也没有看到她。当所有人都离开后，明日香从地板上站起来，走进厨房。她从抽屉里拿出一把锋利的刀，坐在桌前。她坐在美里坐过的位置，对面是真嗣坐过的地方。她把刀抵在左手上，泪水继续滑落。

"I'm sorry, Shinji-kun." she sobbed harder.  
“对不起，真嗣君。”她哭得更厉害了。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Shinji's Room 真嗣的房间

Shinji's eye's popped open as a sharp chill ran down his spine.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，一股尖锐的寒意沿着他的脊椎直窜而下。

_Something's wrong_. He thought as he got up and headed to the kitchen. He noticed the light was on and continued walking towards the kitchen. He froze when he turned the corner and saw a sight that nearly paralyzed him with shock and horror.  
有哪里不对劲。他想着，起身走向厨房。注意到灯亮着，他继续朝厨房走去。当他转过拐角时，眼前的一幕几乎让他惊恐得动弹不得。

"ASUKA!" Shinji shouted as he ran over to her, pried the knife out of her right hand then grabbed a napkin from the counter and wrapped it tightly around her left wrist. Blood was oozing onto the table and the floor, obviously from the Second Child.  
“明日香！” 真嗣大喊着冲向她，从她右手夺过刀，然后从柜台上抓起一块餐巾，紧紧包扎在她左腕上。血从二号机驾驶员的伤口渗出，滴落在桌子和地板上。

Misato same barreling in a couple seconds later. Before she could do anything, Shinji shouted at her.  
美里几秒钟后也冲了进来。还没等她有所行动，真嗣就朝她大喊。

"Misato, quick! Get the bandages, the antiseptic, and the gauze, NOW!"  
"美里，快！拿绷带、消毒剂和纱布来，现在！"

A startled Misato immediately complied.  
惊慌失措的美里立刻照办。

"Let me die, Shinji." Asuka whispered softly.  
"让我死吧，真嗣。" 明日香轻声低语。

"What, Asuka?" a stunned Shinji asked.  
"怎么了，明日香？" 真嗣震惊地问道。

"Let me die." "让我死吧。"

"What are you talking about, Asuka? Let you die? Why would I do that?"  
"你在说什么，明日香？让我死？我为什么要那么做？"

"I deserve it." she cried  
"我应得的。" 她哭喊道

Shinji was still confused. "What are you..."  
真嗣仍然困惑。"你到底在..."

"LET ME DIE!" she shouted, trying to pull away.  
"让我死吧！" 她大喊着，试图挣脱。

"NO!" Shinji quickly countered as he fought to hold Asuka's cut wrist, the pair tumbling to the floor. "Asuka, what's gotten into you?" he asked, pinning her to the floor, still clutching her wrist tightly.  
"不！" 真嗣迅速反驳，努力按住明日香被割伤的手腕，两人一起滚落到地板上。"明日香，你怎么了？" 他问道，将她按在地上，仍然紧紧抓着她的手腕。

"I know you hate me, and you should." she cried, looking up at him.  
"我知道你恨我，你应该恨我。" 她哭着抬头看他。

His eyes widened. "Hate you? I don't hate you."  
他的眼睛睁大了。"恨你？我不恨你。"

"You should. I realize I've been a total bitch to you ever since we met, and it makes me sick! I can't stand it anymore." she cried harder. "I...I'm sorry, Shinji. I'm so sorry."  
"你应该的。我意识到自从我们相遇以来，我一直对你很刻薄，这让我感到恶心！我再也受不了了。"她哭得更厉害了。"我……对不起，真嗣。我真的很抱歉。"

"Asuka, please stop crying. I don't hate you. I could never hate you. You're not a bad person." he said as he helped her sit up.  
"明日香，请别哭了。我不恨你。我永远都不会恨你。你不是个坏人。"他说着帮她坐起身来。"

"YES I AM! I've been so cruel to you this whole time, and you never deserved it. I've hurt you God knows how many times, and you've done nothing but show me kindness. How can you even look at me without being disgusted, or angry? Why don't you hate me?"  
"我就是！这段时间我对你太残忍了，你根本不配受到这些。我伤害了你无数次，而你除了对我展现善意什么都没做。你怎么能看着我而不感到厌恶或愤怒呢？你为什么不恨我？"

"...because I love you Asuka. I know you'll never love me back, but I could never hate you."  
"...因为我是爱你的，明日香。我知道你永远不会爱我，但我永远无法恨你。"

"But...(sniff) I do love you, Shinji."  
"但是...（抽泣）我是爱你的，真嗣。"

He perked up at this, not believing what he had just heard. "What? What did you say, Asuka?"  
听到这话，他精神一振，简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。“什么？你说什么，明日香？”

"I love you Shinji Ikari. I was just too scared to admit it. I...I didn't want to get hurt, that's why I was so mean to you."  
"我爱你，碇真嗣。我只是太害怕承认这一点。我...我不想受伤，所以我才对你那么刻薄。"

_She loves me? But what about Kaji?_ _Get hurt?_ "But, I'd never hurt you, Asuka." he assured her.  
她爱我？那加持先生呢？受伤？ "但是，我绝不会伤害你，明日香。" 他向她保证。

"I know Shinji. You're too nice to do that. But I'm still scared."  
"我知道，真嗣。你太善良了，不会那样做。但我仍然害怕。"

"Of what, Asuka?" "什么，明日香？"

"Of living...without you."  
"活着...没有你。"

"Without...me?" "没有...我？"

By now, Misato had returned with the first aid kit and Shinji was gently tending to her arm. She would have made a teasing remark about the compromising position they were in on the floor, but the tears coming from Asuka's eyes and the concern on Shinji's face made her think twice.  
此时，美里已经带着急救箱回来了，真嗣正轻柔地为她包扎手臂。她本想调侃一下两人尴尬地躺在地板上的姿势，但看着明日香眼中的泪水和真嗣脸上的关切，她犹豫了。

"Why are you doing this, for me?" she asked as he cleaned the wound and applied the bandages.  
“你为什么要为我这么做？”她问道，看着他清理伤口并贴上绷带。

"You're my friend, Asuka. I like to take care of my friends."  
“你是我的朋友，明日香。我喜欢照顾我的朋友。”

"Is...that all I am to you?" she asked, noticing out of the corner of her eye he wasn't looking at her.  
"我...对你来说就只是这样吗？" 她问道，眼角余光注意到他没有看她。

"Asuka, you can do better than me, you always said so."  
"明日香，你能找到比我更好的人，你一直这么说。"

"NO!" she snapped, throwing her head up. "You're the best guy I've ever known, and I've been a total bitch to you. I can't stand causing you any more pain, so I was..."  
"不！" 她猛地抬起头，"你是我认识的最好的人，而我对你一直很刻薄。我无法忍受再给你带来任何痛苦，所以我..."

"Planning to take your own life? Asuka, don't you understand, that would have hurt me more." he said as he finished gently wrapping the gauze around the bandages.  
"打算结束自己的生命吗？明日香，你难道不明白，那样做会让我更心痛。" 他说着，温柔地用绷带包扎好纱布。

"It would...?" "会...吗？"

"I don't want you to die, Asuka. I want you to live, to be happy. Don't give up, Asuka. Maybe Kaji will adopt you or something."  
"我不想你死，明日香。我希望你活着，幸福地生活。不要放弃，明日香。或许加持会收养你之类的。"

"And why would he want a selfish, arrogant, ungrateful bitch like me?"  
"他为什么要一个自私、傲慢、不知感恩的婊子，像我这样的人？"

Shinji's head shot up, blushing slightly, the words coming back to him.  
真嗣猛地抬起头，脸颊微微泛红，那些话再次回响在他耳边。

"How did you...where did..."  
"你怎么会...从哪里...知道这些的？"

"I overheard you and Misato talking about me." _She probably knew I was there._ "I heard everything. Everything."  
"我无意中听到你和美里谈论我。" 她大概知道我在那里。"我听到了一切。所有的一切。"

"Everything? Asuka, it's not what...you're not a..."  
"所有的一切？明日香，不是那样的...你不是..."

"YES I AM!" she was crying harder now. "I'm Sorry, Shinji! I'm so sorry!" she cried as she got up and ran to her room.  
"我就是！" 她现在哭得更厉害了。"对不起，真嗣！我很抱歉！" 她哭着站起来跑回自己的房间。

Misato just stayed in the kitchen as Shinji went after the crying girl. He barged into her room, finding Asuka collapsed on the floor. She was still crying.  
美里只是留在厨房，真嗣则追着哭泣的女孩而去。他冲进她的房间，发现明日香瘫倒在地上，仍在哭泣。

"Asuka." he said as he went over and hugged her tightly, gently stroking her hair, "Please, Asuka, don't cry."  
“明日香。”他走过去紧紧抱住她，轻抚她的头发，“求你了，明日香，别哭了。”

She wanted to pull away. She didn't want to be near him. But here she was, being comforted by the same boy she had hurt numerous times. She didn't deserve it, yet for several minutes she just let herself be comforted by the young man.  
她想挣脱。她不想靠近他。但此刻，她正被那个她伤害过无数次的男孩安慰着。她不配得到这样的安慰，然而几分钟里，她只是让自己被这个年轻人安抚着。

"Shinji?" she finally spoke.  
"真嗣？" 她终于开口道。

"Yes, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"I know I've been terrible to you, but, I want you to know, it stops now."  
"我知道我一直对你很糟糕，但是，我想让你知道，从现在开始不会再这样了。"

"Asuka..." "明日香..."

"No, don't defend me." she cried as he hugged him tightly, as if afraid he would pull away from her. "I've been a monster to you, a devil, just like everyone says. I don't want that."  
"不，不要为我辩护。" 她哭着，他紧紧地拥抱着她，仿佛害怕他会从她身边挣脱。"我一直对你很残忍，像个恶魔，就像大家说的那样。我不希望那样。"

"What do you want, Asuka?"  
"你想要什么，明日香？"

"I...I want a second chance, Shinji. I want to be with you!"  
"我...我想要一个重新开始的机会，真嗣。我想和你在一起！"

"Asuka..." "明日香..."

"I know I don't deserve it, but please Shinji, don't give up on me."  
"我知道我不配得到，但请真嗣，不要放弃我。"

"But, I thought you liked Kaji..."  
“但是，我以为你喜欢加持先生……”

"He'll never love me back, not the way I want. I know that now. Shinji..." she looked into his eyes. "Misato was right, Shinji. I kept ditching those guys Hikari set me up with, because deep down, I wanted to be with you. I finally realize that I'm happy when I'm with you Shinji. I was just too stupid to admit it. Too proud to admit I needed anyone. But the truth is...I need you, Shinji." she gave him a weak smile as she put a hand on his chest, making his heart beat faster. "There's room in my heart for you, if you'll have me." Tears still dripped from her eyes.  
“他永远不会以我想要的方式爱我。我现在明白了。真嗣……”她凝视着他的眼睛。“美里说得对，真嗣。我一直逃避光莉为我安排的那些约会，因为内心深处，我想和你在一起。我终于意识到，和你在一起时我很快乐。我只是太愚蠢，不愿承认。太骄傲，不愿承认我需要任何人。但事实是……我需要你，真嗣。”她把手放在他的胸口，露出一丝虚弱的微笑，让他的心跳加速。“如果你愿意接受我，我的心还有你的位置。”泪水仍从她的眼中滴落。

He pressed his forehead to Asuka's, staring deeply into her eyes. "I love you, Asuka. I just didn't think you even liked me."  
他将额头贴在明日香的额头上，深深地凝视着她的眼睛。“我爱你，明日香。我只是没想到你也会喜欢我。”

"I was an idiot. Please, Shinji, don't give up on me. I promise I can change."  
"我真是个傻瓜。求你了，真嗣，别放弃我。我保证我能改变。"

He wiped a tear out of her eye as he looked at her. "But then you wouldn't be the Asuka I fell in love with." he teased slightly.  
他擦去她眼角的泪水，看着她。"但那样你就不是我爱上时的那个明日香了。"他略带调侃地说道。

"I want to be a better Asuka, for you. Please Shinji?" she paused a bit. "I...I'm sorry. I keep telling you what I want, and I didn't even ask what you wanted. What do you want, Shinji?"  
"我想为了你成为一个更好的明日香。求你了，真嗣？"她稍稍停顿了一下。"我...我很抱歉。我一直告诉你我想要什么，却没问过你想要什么。你想要什么呢，真嗣？"

He thought about that for several seconds. "I want to take care of you Asuka, I want you to be happy. I just didn't think you'd be happy, with me."  
他思考了几秒钟。“我想照顾你，明日香，我希望你幸福。我只是没想到你会因为我而感到幸福。”

She laughed slightly. "Now you're acting like an idiot, Shinji."  
她轻声笑了起来。“你现在像个傻瓜一样，真嗣。”

He smiled at her as he leaned in and kissed her softly on her lips. She moaned softly as she took his kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck tightly. His arms were wrapped around her torso, pulling her in tight as he kissed her with all the love he could muster.  
他微笑着向她靠近，轻轻地吻了她的唇。她轻声呻吟，紧紧地搂住他的脖子。他的手臂环绕着她的腰，将她紧紧拥入怀中，倾尽所有爱意地吻着她。

"I love you, Shinji Ikari." she whispered as she hugged him tightly.  
"我爱你，碇真嗣。" 她轻声说着，紧紧地抱住了他。

"And I love you, Asuka Langley Sohryu." he whispered back to her. "And Asuka? That place in your heart? I'd like to fill it."  
"我也爱你，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。" 他轻声回应她。"还有明日香？你心中的那个位置？我想填满它。"

Asuka merely cried tears of happiness as she held tightly to him.  
明日香只是流着幸福的眼泪，紧紧地抱着他。

Out in the hallway, Misato just smiled as she hugged the air out of Pen-Pen, who was struggling to get away so he could breath.  
在走廊上，美里只是微笑着，紧紧抱住试图挣脱以便呼吸的企鹅潘-潘。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Authors Notes: 作者注：

Normally I don't like Asuka that much. Writing her ego into a story is difficult if you don't have any experience having one. But writing a story with an ego-deflated Asuka is fun. I think she and Shinji would make a good couple, even though I like Shinji/Rei stories more, I thought I'd be fair and write one with Asuka getting her man.  
通常我不太喜欢明日香。如果你没有过那种自负的经历，要把她的自负写进故事里是很难的。但写一个自负被打击的明日香却很有趣。我觉得她和真嗣会是一对好搭档，尽管我更喜欢真嗣/丽的故事，但我想公平一点，写一个明日香赢得真心的故事。

Anyway, read and review please. And please be patient, for I am trying to finish up my other stories about Shinji have relationships with the other women from NGE. (Each one is a little difficult to write) Especially after my Shot Through the Heart story.  
总之，请阅读并评论。请耐心等待，因为我正在努力完成关于真嗣与其他《新世纪福音战士》女性角色关系的其他故事。（每个都写起来有点困难）尤其是在我的《穿心一箭》故事之后。

And now... 而现在...

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

OMAKE! 外传！

"Now you're acting like an idiot, Shinji."  
“现在你表现得像个傻瓜，真嗣。”

He smiled at her as he leaned in and kissed her softly on her lips. She moaned softly as she took his kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck tightly. His arms were wrapped around her torso, pulling her in tight as he kissed her with all the love he could muster.  
他微笑着向她靠近，轻轻地吻在她的唇上。她轻声呻吟，拥抱着他的脖子，紧紧地回应他的吻。他的双臂环绕着她的腰身，将她紧紧拉近，倾尽所有爱意亲吻她。

"I love you, Shinji Ikari." she whispered as she hugged him tightly.  
“我爱你，碇真嗣。”她低声呢喃，紧紧拥抱着他。

"And I love you, Asuka Langley Sohryu." he whispered back to her. "And Asuka? That place in your heart? I'd like to fill it."  
“我也爱你，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”他轻声回应，“还有，明日香，你心中的那个位置？我想填满它。”

Asuka merely cried tears of happiness as she held tightly to him.  
明日香只是流着幸福的泪水，紧紧地抱着他。

"Actually, Shinji, there's something else you can fill for me."  
“实际上，真嗣，还有件事你可以帮我填一下。”

Shinji looked at her a little perplexed.  
真嗣有些困惑地看着她。

"Your stomach? Are you hungry?"  
"你的肚子？你饿了吗？"

"Yes, I'm hungry, but I wasn't talking about my stomach."  
"是的，我饿了，但我说的不是我的肚子。"

"Then what?" "那是什么？"

"It's...a little further south." she grinned as he blushed.  
"再往南一点儿。" 她笑着看他脸红。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

OMAKE 2! 番外 2！

Shinji's pulse started accelerating as he neared his apartment. Fear clutched him, yet he slowly made his feet move.  
随着接近自己的公寓，真嗣的心跳开始加速。恐惧攫住了他，但他还是缓缓地让双脚继续前行。

Misato's apartment was only ten feet away. And each step increased his anxiety.  
美里小姐的公寓只有十英尺远。而每一步都加剧了他的焦虑。

He was terrified, and rightly so.  
他害怕极了，这也是理所当然的。

It wasn't that tonight was Misato's turn to cook. It wasn't that Pen-Pen had become very aggressive around dinner time. (Probably due to Misato's cooking)  
并非今晚轮到美里做饭。也不是因为 Pen-Pen 在晚餐时间变得异常好斗。（大概是因为美里的厨艺）

It was because tonight was Wednesday.  
而是因为今晚是星期三。

Of all the days of the week, this was the one Shinji feared the most.  
在一周的所有日子里，这是真嗣最害怕的一天。

Shinji slowly opened the door and crept to his room.  
真嗣缓缓地推开门，蹑手蹑脚地走向自己的房间。

He got to his door, 'Shinji's Lovely Suite' on the door, and had just opened it, when it creaked.  
他走到门口，门上写着‘真嗣的温馨套房’，刚打开门，就听到了吱嘎声。

Right then, Shinji knew he was dead. His fear was confirmed when a nylon lasso snaked out and wrapped around his body, pinning his arms to his sides. He felt a tug on his body that pulled him into the living room. He landed with a hard thud and it took him several seconds to recover. When he did he was greeted to the sight he expected to see.  
就在那时，真嗣知道自己死定了。当一根尼龙绳索悄无声息地伸出并缠绕在他身上，将他的双臂紧紧固定在身体两侧时，他的恐惧得到了证实。他感到身体被一股力量拉扯，拖进了客厅。他重重地摔在地上，花了好几秒钟才缓过神来。当他回过神来时，眼前出现的正是他预料中的景象。

"Howdy, Pardner!" Asuka grinned widely as she stood over him. She was dressed her black lace panties and bra, a black cowboy hat, black cowboy boots, and six-shooter on her shapely hip. The lasso she had caught Shinji with was in her hands.  
“你好啊，伙计！”明日香咧嘴笑着站在他上方。她穿着黑色蕾丝内裤和胸罩，戴着黑色牛仔帽，脚踩黑色牛仔靴，修长的臀部上挂着六发手枪。她用来套住真嗣的绳索正握在手中。

Shinji sighed. "Hello, Asuka. So, what are we going to do tonight?" _Like I want to know_.  
真嗣叹了口气。“你好，明日香。那么，今晚我们要做什么呢？”就像我想知道似的。

"Well, I figured I'm gonna tame me an Ikari. I've already roped 'em, now I'm gonna ride 'em!" she grinned as she brought out a saddle from behind the couch.  
“嗯，我想我要驯服一个碇。我已经套住他了，现在我要骑他！”她笑着从沙发后面拿出一个马鞍。

"But what about Misato?" he asked, hoping that would curb her.  
“但美里呢？”他问道，希望这能让她收敛些。

"She went to wet her whistle with Doc Akagi at their fav'orite watterin hole." she grinned.  
“她和赤木博士去他们最喜欢的酒吧润润喉咙了。”她咧嘴笑道。

Shinji's head fell back against the carpet with a sigh. _Great, alone again_. He thought glumly.  
真嗣的头叹息着靠在地板上。好吧，又是一个人了。他沮丧地想。

Ever since she had come out of her coma a couple months ago, Asuka had changed. For one thing, she had professed that she loved Shinji. This was a good thing. The second thing, however, was the fact that she had become incredibly creative in how she showed her love. Every night was a different cosplay and sexual encounter.  
自从几个月前从昏迷中醒来后，明日香就变了。首先，她宣称她爱上了真嗣。这是件好事。然而，第二件事则是她表达爱的方式变得极其富有创意。每晚都是不同的角色扮演和性爱体验。

And tonight was Cowboy Night!  
而今晚是牛仔之夜！

_At least she's not going to brand me again_. He thought as Asuka stripped off his pants.  
至少她不会再给我烙印了。当明日香脱下他的裤子时，他这样想着。

Thursday was Tarzan Night. (Leopard skin bikini, HELL YEAH!)  
周四是泰山之夜。（豹纹比基尼，太棒了！）

Friday was Nurse Night. (Is your temperature rising?)  
周五是护士之夜。（你的体温在升高吗？）

Saturday was Star Wars Night. (Yes, the metal bikini episode)  
周六是星球大战之夜。（没错，金属比基尼那一集）

Sunday was Geisha Night. (Eating sushi off people, HELLO!)  
周日是艺伎之夜。（从人身上吃寿司，你好！）

Monday was French Maid Night. (Room Service, anyone?)  
周一是法国女仆之夜。（客房服务，有人吗？）

Tuesday was Hula Dancer Night. (Mahalo, means 'thank you')  
周二是草裙舞者之夜。（Mahalo，意为‘谢谢’）

(Just a little fan service for all those guys who have always imagined Asuka in different costumes)  
(只是为那些一直想象明日香穿不同服装的粉丝们提供的一点小小福利)

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

OMAKE 3 番外 3

"Kiss me, Kaji!" Asuka whined as she wrapped her arms around the unshaven mans neck.  
"吻我，加持！" 明日香抱怨着，双臂环绕在那个胡子拉碴男人的脖子上。

"Asuka, I can't." Ryoji Kaji replied, trying to pry the girl off him.  
"明日香，我不能。" 加持良治回答，试图将女孩从自己身上拉开。

"Why not? No one will know. I won't tell."  
"为什么不行？没人会知道的。我不会说出去。"

"Yes, you will." "是的，你会的。"

"You're right. I'd brag about it till the world stopped spinning."  
"你说得对。我会一直吹嘘到世界停止旋转。"

"I'm sorry, Asuka, I still can't kiss you."  
"对不起，明日香，我还是不能吻你。"

"But why?" "但为什么？"

"Because...I'm gay." "因为……我是同性恋。"

"WHAT!" "什么！"

"Now you know my dark secret."  
"现在你知道我的黑暗秘密了。"

"But, but, but...all those women you flirt with. Misato. Ritsuko. Maya. Even though I heard she's a lesbian."  
"但是，但是，但是...那些你调情的女人。美里。律子。真希波。尽管我听说她是女同性恋。"

"I'm a spy, I'm supposed to flirt with women."  
"我是个间谍，我应该和女人调情。"

"But how can that be?"  
"但那怎么可能呢？"

"Well, if you spent a week having sex with Misato, then you'd also have effectively sated your pallet for the opposite sex."  
"嗯，如果你花一周时间和美里做爱，那么你也会有效地满足你对异性的欲望。"

"DAMMIT MISATO!" an angry redhead shouted as she stormed out of the room. "You are always ruining my chances with KAJI, and NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!"  
"该死的美里！"一个愤怒的红发女子一边喊着一边冲出房间。"你总是破坏我和加持的机会，现在你真的搞砸了！"

Across the city, a shiver ran down the spine of a certain purple-haired woman.  
在这座城市的另一端，一位紫发女子不由自主地打了个寒颤。

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

OMAKE 4 番外 4

Shinji was about to take another sip from his drink when he sees that his father and Kouzou walk by. Shinji then noticed that his father's hands were burned. '_I wonder how he got that_?'  
真嗣正要再喝一口饮料，这时他看到父亲和克劳斯走了过去。真嗣随后注意到父亲的双手被烧伤了。'我想知道他是怎么弄的？'

"What's wrong?" Misato asked.  
“怎么了？”美里问道。

"Well, nothing's wrong." Shinji awkwardly replied.  
“嗯，没什么。”真嗣尴尬地回答。

Misato frowned at Shinji. '_Here he goes again_.' "Are you aware that when you say 'nothing' that way, it's the same as asking others to pay attention to you?" Misato glared at Shinji.  
美里皱着眉头看向真嗣。'他又来了。'“你那样说‘没事’，其实是在让别人关注你，你知道吗？”美里瞪着真嗣。

Shinji eyes widened as he, well, never thought of that. Being the idi…um, slow as he was. Shinji conceded and spoke what was on his mind at the time. "Well, it's just that my father seems to have burned his hands."  
真嗣的眼睛睁大了，他，呃，从未想过这一点。作为那个迟钝的……嗯，反应慢的他，真嗣承认并说出了当时心中的想法。“嗯，只是我父亲似乎把手烧伤了。”

"Burned?" Misato was a little surprised about this. While she knew some of what happened before she joined NERV, she didn't know everything. And the story behind Commander Ikari's burned hands was one of them.  
“烧伤？”美里对此有些惊讶。虽然她知道一些自己加入 NERV 之前发生的事情，但并不是全部。而关于碇司令手上的烧伤背后的故事，就是其中之一。

"I was just wondering how it happened." Shinji asked.  
"我只是想知道这是怎么发生的。" 真嗣问道。

"Burns?" While Misato didn't know, someone else in the room might. Misato turned her attention to Ritsuko. "Do you know anything about those burns?"  
"烧伤？" 虽然美里不知道，但房间里的其他人可能知道。美里转向律子，"你知道那些烧伤的事吗？"

"Oh, yes. Dumb fool was juggling flaming steak knives one night, and well...he caught them all the wrong end. Nearly took his eye out too."  
"哦，是的。那个傻瓜有天晚上在玩火烤牛排刀，结果...他全接错了地方。差点连眼睛都保不住。"

"Figures. Was he trying to impress someone?"  
"果然。他这是想给谁留下深刻印象吗？"

"No. He was auditioning for a Japanese Steak House cook. When that didn't work out, he chose to become a military commander."  
"不是。他是在应聘日本牛排馆的厨师。那没成功后，他决定改行当军事指挥官。"

"We are in so much trouble here."  
"我们这下可麻烦大了。"

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

OMAKE 5 外传 5

"Has anyone seen Pen-Pen?" Misato asked.  
“有人看到 Pen-Pen 了吗？”美里问道。

"Not me." Shinji said. "不是我。" 真嗣说。

"Yeah, I put him back in his fridge." Asuka called from the living room.  
"是啊，我把他放回冰箱了。" 明日香从客厅喊道。

Misato went to look inside, but found he wasn't there.  
美里走过去查看，却发现他不在那里。

"He's not here, Asuka!" "他不在这里，明日香！"

"What? I put him in there myself!" she said as she entered the kitchen. "No, not that one. The other one."  
"什么？我亲手把他放进去的！"" 她走进厨房说道，""不，不是那个。是另一个。"

"Other one?" "另一个？"

"Yeah, the new one we got."  
“是啊，我们新买的那个。”

Misato went pale as she raced to the new refrigerator and opened the upper door, pulling out a solid block of ice that had a penguin's head sticking out of the top.  
美里脸色苍白，急忙跑到新冰箱前，打开上面的门，取出一个冰块，冰块顶部露出了一只企鹅的头。

"WARK! WARK!" he cried as he struggled to get free of the block of ice.  
“哇克！哇克！”他挣扎着想要从冰块中挣脱出来，大声呼喊着。

"THAT'S THE FREEZER YOU PINHEAD!" Misato shouted as she took the mostly frozen penguin into the bathroom to thaw him out.  
"那可是冰箱，你个笨蛋！" 美里一边喊着，一边把几乎冻僵的企鹅带进浴室解冻。

"Well how was I supposed to know?"  
"我怎么可能知道嘛？"

"And you wonder why he avoids you nowadays." Shinji muttered as he went to his room.  
"难怪他现在躲着你。" 真嗣嘀咕着回自己房间去了。

### Comment
[DarkFusion](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/491989/DarkFusion): Not a bad Shinji x Asuka fic. Like you I prefer Shinji x Rei, but I do like Shinji x Asuka as well. All in all not a bad portrayal for the both of them. Nice job.  PS: Great omakes as always. I especially loved the second omake (heh heh)  
这不是一篇糟糕的碇真嗣 x 惣流·明日香·兰格雷同人文。像你一样，我更喜欢碇真嗣 x 绫波零，但我也很喜欢碇真嗣 x 惣流·明日香。总的来说，对他们两人的描绘并不差。做得好。附言：一如既往的精彩番外。我特别喜欢第二个番外（嘿嘿）

[dennisud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/60065/dennisud): I've read both your stories and so far they're well wirten and entertaining.  
我读过你的两篇故事，到目前为止，它们写得很好，也很吸引人。  
  
A bit more narrative and introspection and you have a classic in the making.  
再多一些叙述和内省，你就能创作出一部经典之作。  
  
Just remember that when your taking them away from their canon personalities you have to justify that.  
记住，当你让他们脱离原著性格时，你必须为此找到合理的解释。

[umbrellaman](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/692258/umbrellaman): It's not a bad fic, I do like it and I am an AxS kinda guy. It's just that...well, I'm the last person to talk about OOC-ness, but I really don't think Asuka would just break down and confess like that. I think she'd bottle it all up inside herself and not say anything, or if she did she'd probably tell Hikari (and even that's not a certainty). But what do I know?  
这不是一篇糟糕的同人文，我确实喜欢它，而且我是个典型的碇真嗣×惣流·明日香·兰格雷类型的粉丝。只是...好吧，我可能是谈论角色出戏的最后一个人，但我真的不认为明日香会那样崩溃并坦白。我觉得她会把一切都藏在心里，什么也不说，或者如果她真的说了，她可能会告诉光（甚至这也不能确定）。但我知道什么呢？

[Draknal](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/807161/Draknal): -*sniff*- That was a truly inspiring piece fo work. I LOVE Asuka x Shinji fics! They are most definately my favorite coupling. Everyone was well in character, and the ending turned out well. Congrats on another successful fic! The par twith Pen Pen was pretty funny, as well as the outtake with Asuka lassoing Shinji. _  
-*抽泣*- 那真是一篇鼓舞人心的作品。我超爱明日香 x 真嗣的同人文！他们绝对是我最喜欢的 CP。每个人物都刻画得很好，结局也很圆满。恭喜又一篇成功的同人文！其中企鹅潘潘的部分相当搞笑，还有明日香用套索捉住真嗣的片段也很逗。_  
  
Poor guy! At least one of them is happy! And in the fic when Pen Pen was trying to escape Misato cause she was keeping him from breathing while squeezing him, I can only imagine that! Go PEN PEN!  
可怜的家伙！至少他们中有一个是幸福的！在文中，当潘潘试图逃离美里，因为她紧紧抱着他导致他无法呼吸时，我只能想象那情景！加油，潘潘！

[liljimmyurine](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/727516/liljimmyurine): Man, you REALLY don't like Asuka, do you? Everything you have involving her is almost one-dimensional sometimes. They're good stories, don't bet me wrong, but they seem... shallow sometimes. After whatever Shinji does to impress or save her, she confesses her love in the same way. Anyway. It's good, and I'll leave it at that  
老兄，你真的不太喜欢明日香，是吧？你写的关于她的故事几乎总是单维度的。这些故事不错，别误会，但有时候显得...有些肤浅。不管碇真嗣做了什么来打动或拯救她，她表白的方式总是一成不变。不过，故事还是不错的，我就说到这儿吧。

Naota007: Very well written SxA fic. , however why people love Rei so much I can never understand, I always hated her, too emotionless, and even though she was important to the plot, she just felt like a doll to me, I hated her with a passion. Asuka on the other hand rocks! *sortof because I symphatize with her* and second because, well shes Asuka! and at least she had emotion* I still say Shini and Asuka should of ended up together *and in End of Eva they technically did*, anyway while the characters are true to their feelings and stuff like that, Asuka would most likely never have admitted to herself that she liked Shinji, but still I'd like to see how Anno would do a scene like this, to bad he won't re-make EVA, just re-release it, again very well written SxA, and hilarious OMAKEs.  
写得非常棒的薰香同人文。不过，我始终无法理解为什么人们那么喜欢丽，我总是讨厌她，太缺乏情感了，尽管她在剧情中很重要，但对我来说她就像个玩偶，我恨她入骨。而明日香则不同，她很棒！*一方面是因为我同情她*，另一方面，呃，她就是明日香！至少她有情感*我仍然认为真嗣和明日香应该在一起*在《EVA 终》中他们实际上也确实如此*，无论如何，尽管角色们的情感都很真实，明日香很可能永远不会承认自己喜欢真嗣，但我还是想看看庵野会如何处理这样的场景，可惜他不会再重制 EVA，只是重新发行，这篇薰香同人文写得非常好，搞笑的 OMAKEs 也很精彩。

[Aoirann](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1081522/Aoirann): My one complaint is that Asuka is still bleeding out while they are having this little heart-to-heart. Other then that it is a good story.  
我唯一的抱怨是，在他们进行这场心灵交流时，明日香仍在流血。除此之外，这是一个好故事。

[Dr. Jhon Smith](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2418800/Dr-Jhon-Smith): The relationship development passed far to quickly! Though justified by the thwarted suicide attempt! However, I can empathize with your difficulty writing an Asuka with an ego, deflating her ego is much easier as it would seem. Touhching ending as it were, I still feel you could have tried harder with Asuka, I saw a lot of oppertunities to make this a few chapters longer, but I think that's not the case here and you just wanted a one shot. I'd give it a 3.5/5, plot flows well, but relationship upgrade was too fastfrward for me. Other than that Superb job.  
关系发展过于迅速！虽然被阻止的自杀尝试有所解释！然而，我能理解你塑造一个自尊心强的明日香的难度，削弱她的自尊似乎更容易。尽管如此，结尾感人，我仍觉得你可以对明日香下更多功夫，我看到了许多延长章节的机会，但看来你只想写一篇短篇。我会给它 3.5/5 分，情节流畅，但关系升级对我来说太快了。除此之外，做得非常好。

[Dragonjek](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1788632/Dragonjek): It was good, up until the attempted suicide. It's extremely OOC-considering how her mother died, she'd be more likely to buy a doll collection (although I could see her having indulged in self-harm at some point). And while I get that having had her ungratefulness and bitchiness laid out before her like that would mellow her out, you made her way too sappy & emotional. It just no longer felt like Asuka.  
直到自杀未遂之前，一切都很好。这非常不符合角色性格——考虑到她母亲的死，她更可能会去买一堆玩偶收藏（尽管我能想象她在某个时刻曾沉溺于自残）。虽然我能理解，经历了那种被揭露忘恩负义和刻薄一面的打击后，她会变得温和，但你把她写得太过于多愁善感了。这不再像是明日香了。

Finn202: This is one of my favourote fanfics ever, it just plays my heart strings like a harp making me feel, revitalized and just happy to be alive. Continue making great fanfics (hopefully something similar to this.)  
这是我一直以来最喜欢的同人文之一，它就像弹奏竖琴一样拨动我的心弦，让我感到焕然一新，仅仅是活着就感到无比幸福。 继续创作优秀的同人文吧（希望有类似的作品。）
