CAPTION: NEON GENESIS EVANGELION CAPTION 2: Shinji, Will You Dance With Me?  
标题：新世纪福音战士 副标题：真嗣，愿意与我共舞吗？

Misato's apartment. The clock in the dark hallway reads 6:01 AM. A feminine silhouette with short hair emerges from a door and tiptoes towards the next one...but, suddenly, a hand switches the light on and completely paralyzes the figure in her tracks. She has been caught!  
美里家的公寓。昏暗的走廊里，时钟显示着 6:01 AM。一个短发女性的身影从一扇门中悄悄走出，蹑手蹑脚地朝下一扇门走去...然而，突然间，一只手打开了灯，彻底让那身影僵在原地。她被逮个正着！

Misato: "I think I deserve a little explanation, don't you?"  
美里：“我觉得我应该得到一点解释，你不觉得吗？”

Misato is in pajamas next to the light switch. The other girl doesn't dare to move. She has shoulder-length red hair. The girl turns back towards the older woman.  
美里穿着睡衣站在电灯开关旁。另一个女孩不敢动弹。她有着齐肩的红发。女孩转过身面向年长的女性。

Asuka: "Well, I was going to my room. Any objections?"  
明日香：“嗯，我正要去我的房间。有什么问题吗？”

Misato: "Why were you in Shinji's room so early in the morning?"  
美里：“一大早你为什么在真嗣的房间里？”

Asuka: "That's none of your business, Misato."  
明日香：“这跟你没关系，美里。”

Misato: "I know you've been doing this every morning for a month now. What are you doing in his room?"  
葛城：“我知道你这一个月来每天早上都在这么做。你在他房间里干什么？”

Asuka (letting out an exasperated sigh): "I'm sleeping. Isn't that what people usually do during the night?"  
明日香（无奈地叹了口气）：“我在睡觉。这不是人们通常在夜里做的事吗？”

Misato: "With Shinji?" 葛城：“和真嗣一起？”

Asuka: "Well, it's his room."  
明日香：“嗯，这是他的房间。”

Misato is a bit dumbstuck by that. But she eventually manages a smile at her younger roommate.  
美里对此有些哑口无言。但她最终还是对她的年轻室友露出了微笑。

Misato: "So you two are getting along better now..."  
美里：“看来你们俩现在相处得更好了……”

Asuka doesn't answer. Instead, she enters her room and closes the door behind her. Misato then does the same, wearing a huge grin on her face.  
明日香没有回答。她走进自己的房间，随手关上了门。随后，美里也做了同样的动作，脸上挂着大大的笑容。

The next day. 第二天。

Asuka: "Hurry up, baka Shinji! We're going to be late!"  
明日香：“快点，笨蛋真嗣！我们要迟到了！”

They are in Shinji's room. Asuka's already in her school uniform, while Shinji is finishing putting his on.  
他们在真嗣的房间里。明日香已经换上了校服，而真嗣正在穿好他的衣服。

Shinji: "But...Asuka...my legs are still a bit weak..."  
真嗣：“但是...明日香...我的腿还有点无力...”

Asuka: "I don't care, hurry up!"  
明日香：“我不管，快点！”

Shinji: "Oh, well... 真嗣："哦，好吧...

Misato is in the doorway, not yet fully dressed, a can of beer in hand.  
美里站在门口，还未完全穿戴整齐，手里拿着一罐啤酒。

Misato: "Asuka, don't be so hard on him. Ritsuko said he would be able to walk today, but that doesn't mean that he has to do it as if his legs were 100% okay..."  
美里："明日香，别对他太苛刻了。律子说他今天能走路，但这并不意味着他的腿就完全没问题了..."

Asuka: "Oh, don't be so soft on him! I know he's a wimp, but, still...!"  
明日香：“哦，别对他那么温柔！我知道他是个胆小鬼，但，还是……！”

Shinji gets up. 真嗣站了起来。

Shinji: "You see? I can stand up just fine. There's no problem."  
真嗣：“看到了吗？我站起来完全没问题。没事的。”

Misato: "Stop lying, Shinji. Your legs are shaking."  
碇真嗣，别撒谎了，你的腿在发抖。

Asuka looks down at them. They are indeed shaking.  
明日香低头一看，它们确实在颤抖。

Asuka (glaring at Misato): "I don't care! He's coming with me to school today!"  
明日香（瞪着葛城美里）："我不管！他今天得跟我一起去学校！"

Misato: "Oh, well...if I can't make you change your mind..."  
葛城：“哦，好吧...如果我无法让你改变主意...”

Asuka: "Okay, time to go!"  
明日香：“好了，该出发了！”

She almost pushes Shinji out of his room, and then out of the apartment. On the way out, Asuka looks the calendar in the kitchen. It's June the 6th, 2016.  
她几乎把真嗣推出了他的房间，然后又推出了公寓。在出门的路上，明日香瞥了一眼厨房的日历。那是 2016 年 6 月 6 日。

Misato (calling): "Hey! Did you eat breakfast?"  
葛城（打电话）：“喂！你吃早饭了吗？”

Asuka (on her way to the elevator): "I packed some extra food for us! We'll eat it on the way!"  
明日香（走向电梯）：“我多带了些吃的！我们路上吃！”

The elevator door closes. Misato stands in the doorway, looking very surprised.  
电梯门关上了。葛城站在门口，显得非常惊讶。

Misato (to herself): "Huh? Asuka's cooking now?"  
惣流（自言自语）：“咦？明日香现在开始做饭了？”

Tokyo-3's streets. Asuka and Shinji are walking side by side.  
第三新东京市的街道上，明日香和真嗣并肩而行。

Shinji: "Asuka...please slow down. I can't follow your pace..."  
真嗣：“明日香……请慢一点。我跟不上你的步伐……”

Asuka: "Oh, sorry." 明日香："哦，对不起。"

She slows down her walking speed to match his. Shinji's legs are still a bit weak, and he can't walk too quickly.  
她放慢了步伐以配合他。真嗣的腿还有些无力，走不快。

Shinji: "Thanks." 真嗣："谢谢。"

Asuka (smiling): "Well...and to think it's all my fault..."  
明日香（微笑着）：“哎呀……想想这都是我的错……”

Shinji (chuckling): "Errr...not entirely, but..."  
真嗣（轻笑）：“呃……也不全是，但是……”

Asuka (honestly elated): "I'm happy that you can walk again!"  
明日香（真心高兴）：“你能再次走路，我真高兴！”

Shinji: "But I'm still weak..."  
真嗣：“但我还是太弱了……”

Asuka: "Isn't it better than your wheelchair?"  
明日香：“总比坐轮椅强吧？”

Shinji: "A bit more tiring...in the wheelchair, I was able to sit down, at least..."  
真嗣：“确实更累一些……坐轮椅至少还能坐着……”

Asuka: "You got lazy, huh?"  
明日香：“你变懒了啊？”

Shinji: "Yeah. But when I think about the other morning, when you woke up too late and Misato caught you leaving my room...I have to say, I'm not as lazy as you!"  
真嗣：“是啊。但一想到那天早上，你起得太晚，结果被美里小姐撞见你从我房间出来...我得说，我可没你那么懒！”

Asuka (grinning devilishly): "Well, here's the school. Come on, let's hurry up and get to class!"  
明日香（狡黠地笑着）：“好啦，学校到了。快点，我们赶紧去上课吧！”

And with those last words, she starts running towards the school, leaving Shinji behind.  
随着最后那句话，她开始向学校跑去，留下真嗣在原地。

Shinji: "Hey, Asuka! Wait for me!"  
真嗣：“嘿，明日香！等等我！”

He tries his best to catch up to her, as she is looking back and stick- ing her tongue out at him...  
他尽力追赶她，而她回头向他吐了吐舌头……

Class 2-A. Lunch time. Toji and Kensuke are standing at Shinji's desk. They're the only ones here now.  
2 年 A 班。午餐时间。东治和健介站在真嗣的课桌旁。现在这里只有他们三人。

Kensuke: "Wow, you recovered so quickly!"  
健介：“哇，你恢复得真快！”

Toji: "Shinji's an Eva pilot! He's strong, isn't he?"  
东治：“真嗣是 Eva 驾驶员！他很强壮，不是吗？”

Kensuke: "Yeah! I wish I could be a pilot too! I'll have to ask Misato-san!"  
健介：“耶！我也想成为飞行员！我得去问问美里小姐！”

Shinji: "Well, I need to walk a lot to get my strength back in my legs, but it's really tiring..."  
真嗣：“嗯，我需要多走路来恢复腿部的力量，但这真的很累人……”

Toji: "But it's better than not being able to at all, right?"  
东治：“但总比完全不能动要好吧？”

Shinji (sighing): "Yeah..."  
真嗣（叹气）：“嗯……”

Eyes open wide all around as a lunch box suddenly hits his desk. Asuka had just walked up behind Kensuke and Toji and slammed it down there.  
随着一个便当盒突然砸在他的桌子上，周围的人都瞪大了眼睛。明日香刚刚走到剑介和东治背后，用力将便当盒放在那里。

Asuka (in her usual disdainful tone): "You forgot your lunch this morning, you stupid idiot!"  
明日香（一如既往地轻蔑语气）：“你今天早上忘了带午餐，你这个笨蛋！”

Toji: "Oh, no, the red-headed devil strikes again."  
冬二："哎呀，不好，红发恶魔又来捣乱了。"

Asuka: "I have nothing to say to a moron like you! I'm just trying to graciously give Baka here his lunch."  
明日香："我跟你这种笨蛋没什么好说的！我只是好心给这个傻瓜送午饭而已。"

She then turns around and walks out of the classroom, closely followed by Hikari. They all turn to watch her as Shinji takes the lid off of the bento box.  
随后她转身走出教室，紧随其后的是光。他们都转头看着她，而真嗣则打开了便当盒的盖子。

Shinji (to himself): "W-what? She...I probably didn't hear well..."  
真嗣（自言自语）：“什、什么？她……我可能听错了……”

Toji: "That looks delicious, Shinji. You should eat it..."  
东治：“看起来很好吃啊，真嗣。你应该尝尝……”

Shinji: "Hm...yeah, of course."  
真嗣：“嗯……是啊，当然。”

The three began to eat their lunches.  
三人开始吃起了各自的午餐。

Toji: "By the way, Shinji, did you hear that..."  
东治：“对了，真嗣，你听说那件事了吗……”

Outside, on a patch of grass near the school, two girls are peacefully eating their lunches. Until this moment.  
在学校附近的一片草地上，两个女孩正安静地吃着午餐。直到这一刻。

Hikari: "YOU'RE *WHAT*!?"  
光: "你*什么*了!?"

Asuka (covering Hikari's mouth with her hand): "SHHH! Hikari, not so loud!"  
明日香（用手捂住光的嘴）: "嘘！光，小声点！"

Hikari: "But that's insane! You're barely 14! Have you thought about all the complications?! And what if you..."  
光: "但这太疯狂了！你才刚满 14 岁！你考虑过所有可能的复杂情况吗？！而且万一你……"

Asuka: "I won't, Hikari! I once heard that prolonged contact with the Eva's liquid has an effect on that."  
明日香：“我不会的，光！我曾听说长时间接触 Eva 的液体会有影响。”

Hikari: "But you don't know that for sure, do you?"  
光：“但你也不能确定，对吧？”

Asuka: "You're right. Well, there's other ways around that."  
明日香：“你说得对。嗯，总有其他办法解决的。”

Hikari (sighing): "Still, what exactly are you thinking? I mean, you're always so hard on him, and now you're telling me...I can't believe it!"  
光（叹气）：“即便如此，你到底在想什么？我是说，你总是对他那么严格，现在你却告诉我……我简直不敢相信！”

Asuka: "I'm decided to give that piece of me to him...I mean...I'd like to give him something special for his birthday..."  
明日香：“我决定把我的一部分给他……我的意思是……我想在他生日时给他一份特别的礼物……”

Hikari: "That's not something you just *give* to a boy, Asuka. It's something special, and to just treat it so casually..."  
光：“那不是随便就能给一个男孩子的东西，明日香。它是特别的，你不能这么轻率地对待它……”

Asuka (standing up): "I'm not treating it casually, Hikari. I've been thinking about it for a long time now."  
明日香（站起来）：“我没有随便对待，光。我一直在认真思考这个问题。”

Hikari: "How long?" 光：“多久了？”

Pause. 停顿。

Asuka: "I don't remember when I started to."  
明日香：“我不记得是什么时候开始的。”

Her lunch now finished, Asuka starts walking back to her homeroom class. Hikari promptly follows her.  
吃完午饭，明日香开始走回自己的教室。光立刻跟了上去。

Hikari: "You know, you're cuter with your hair shorter."  
光：“你知道吗，你短发更可爱。”

Asuka (chuckling): "I don't think everyone likes my hair cut like this."  
明日香（轻笑）：“我觉得不是每个人都喜欢我这样的发型。”

Hikari: "Then why did you do it?"  
光：“那你为什么要这么做？”

Asuka: "I thought Shinji might notice it and like it if I got it done, because I notice how he's always looking at Wondergirl. Of course I wasn't going to get it cut as short as hers. She looks like she belongs in the American army."  
明日香：“我以为如果我剪了头发，真嗣可能会注意到并且喜欢，因为我注意到他总是盯着 Wondergirl 看。当然，我不会剪得像她那么短。她看起来就像美国军队里的人。”

Hikari: "That's not a very good reason to get a haircut, Asuka."  
光：“这并不是一个剪头发的好理由，明日香。”

Asuka: "I don't care. I did it for him and he told me likes it this way. That's all that matters to me now."  
明日香：“我不在乎。我这么做是为了他，他说他喜欢这样。现在这对我来说就是最重要的。”

From the window of a classroom on the second floor, three boys were watching the scene. They were focusing on one of the girls. When Asuka went out of their sight, a tall boy with dark brown hair started to talk.  
从二楼教室的窗户里，三个男孩正注视着这一幕。他们的目光聚焦在其中一个女孩身上。当明日香从他们的视线中消失时，一个深棕色头发的高个子男孩开始说话。

Tenchi: "Is that the girl, Koichi?"  
天城：“就是那个女孩吗，小一？”

Koichi: "Yeah. That little bitch will pay for humiliating me like that."  
小一：“对，那个小贱人会为羞辱我付出代价的。”

A smaller guy joins them.  
一个较矮小的家伙加入了他们。

Shukaido: "Is this really necessary?"  
修海道：“这真的有必要吗？”

Koichi (nodding): "Absolutely. I can still feel that slap across my face like she just did it. And don't worry, once I'm finished with her, you can have some fun with her as well..."  
小一（点头）：“绝对没错。我还能感觉到那一巴掌仿佛刚刚打在脸上。别担心，等我收拾完她，你也可以找她乐一乐……”

A wicked smiles crosses his face...  
他脸上掠过一丝邪恶的笑容……

Tenchi: "Okay, I'll go see if the other team is ready, then."  
天智：“好的，我去看看对方队伍准备好了没。”

Koichi: "Tell them that NERV security is pretty tough."  
小光：“告诉他们，NERV 的安保相当严密。”

For the rest of the day, Asuka completely ignored Shinji, except for the times when she insulted him. Nothing out of the usual there, but she seemed to dig into Shinji even harder then she usually did. He was a bit disturbed by that. The girl who was cuddling up to him every night, sharing body warmth with him, seemed meaner than ever before during the day...as if she was switching personalities like masks.  
那天剩下的时间里，明日香完全无视了真嗣，除了她辱骂他的时刻。这没什么不寻常的，但她似乎比平时更加严厉地针对真嗣。这让他有些不安。那个每晚依偎着他，与他分享体温的女孩，在白天却比以往任何时候都更加刻薄……仿佛她在切换人格，如同更换面具一般。

On the way back to school, Asuka sees Shinji, and she goes up to him to talk.  
在回学校的路上，明日香看到真嗣，便走上前去与他交谈。

Asuka: "Are your legs okay?"  
明日香：“你的腿还好吗？”

Shinji (coldly): "Better now, for all you care."  
真嗣（冷冷地）：“现在好多了，反正你也不在乎。”

Asuka is a bit shocked by that kind of tone. She reaches over to take his hand in hers, but just as she touches his hand, he yanks it away from her.  
明日香被这种语气惊到了。她伸手去握他的手，但就在她触碰到他的手时，他猛地把手抽了回去。

Shinji: "Don't touch me!"  
真嗣：“别碰我！”

Asuka is now even more surprised.  
明日香现在更加惊讶了。

Asuka: "What's wrong?" 明日香：“怎么了？”

Shinji: "'What's wrong'?! Why are you acting like that!?"  
真嗣："'怎么了'？！你为什么那样表现！？

Asuka (puzzled): "What?" 明日香（困惑）："什么？"

Shinji: "When we're alone, you act nice and sweet and all, but when we're around other people you keep putting me down, like you usually do. Don't you know how much that hurts?"  
真嗣："当我们独处时，你表现得温柔又甜蜜，但一旦有别人在场，你就又开始贬低我，就像你平常那样。你难道不知道那有多伤人吗？"

Asuka (looking down a little): "But, Shinji..."  
明日香（略微低头）：“但是，真嗣……”

Shinji (angry): "I understand! You're ashamed of me! You don't want others to see you being with me! You're using me! I thought that you wanted me to walk home with me because you were proud or whatever to be with me! How could I be such a damn fool?"  
真嗣（愤怒地）：“我明白了！你以我为耻！你不想让别人看到你和我在一起！你在利用我！我以为你让我陪你走回家是因为你以和我在一起为荣或者别的什么！我怎么会这么愚蠢？”

Now Shinji looks down. 现在真嗣低下了头。

Shinji (softer): "You're just using me for your own happiness...you don't care at all...about how I feel..."  
真嗣（语气柔和）：“你只是为了自己的幸福利用我……你根本不在乎……我的感受……”

He then starts to almost run towards the apartment. Asuka can't believe it. The boy whose legs were so weak this morning...was running. He was running away from her.  
随后他几乎开始跑向公寓。明日香难以置信。那个今早还腿脚无力的男孩……正在奔跑。他在逃离她。

Asuka (whispering): "Shinji, you're wrong. *I'm* the fool here."  
明日香（低声自语）：“真嗣，你错了。*我*才是这里的傻瓜。”

That evening. Asuka is walking silently down the street, when she passes a bar. She remembers something, turns and walks in, approaching the bartender.  
那天傍晚，明日香默默地走在街上，经过一家酒吧时，她想起了什么，转身走了进去，向酒保走去。

Asuka: "Excuse me, where is the women's washroom?"  
明日香：“打扰一下，请问女洗手间在哪里？”

Bartender: "On your left, Miss."  
酒保：“在您左边，小姐。”

Asuka doesn't reply. She just heads there. Once inside, she sees another woman leaving a stall. But that isn't her reason for being there. She spots a vending machine, and drops a 100-yen coin into it. As soon as the item hits the slot at the bottom of the machine, she picks it up and slides it into her schoolbag as fast as she can. The woman, completely speechless, eyes her carefully. Asuka tries to hide her embarrassment from the woman by quickly running out of the place. Once outside, she takes a quick look at the item she just bought and puts it back in her schoolbag.  
明日香没有回答，只是径直前往那里。一进去，她看到另一个女人正从隔间出来。但这并不是她来这里的原因。她发现了一台自动售货机，投入了一枚 100 日元的硬币。商品一落到机器底部的取货口，她就迅速拿起并塞进书包。那位女士目瞪口呆，仔细地打量着她。明日香试图通过快速逃离来掩饰自己的尴尬。一到外面，她迅速查看了一下刚买的物品，然后又放回了书包。

Asuka: "Prevention is better than cure."  
明日香：“预防胜于治疗。”

The street is rather empty, which it usually is at this time of the day. As she thinks about the conversation she had with Hikari during lunch, she feels a sudden jolt shoot through her body, and falls to the ground. A pair of hands pick her up by her arms, and another pair grabs her ankles. Before she can realize it, she is being carried into a dark alley. She tries to turn her head, but she finds herself too weak to do so. She can't feel her body anymore...  
街道相当空旷，通常这个时间都是如此。当她回想起午餐时与光子的对话时，突然感到一阵剧烈的震动穿过身体，跌倒在地。一双有力的手抓住她的胳膊将她扶起，另一双手则抓住她的脚踝。在她意识到之前，她已被抬进一条昏暗的小巷。她试图转头，却发现自己虚弱得无法动弹。她再也感觉不到自己的身体了……

Tenchi: "Man, that stun gun really does what it's supposed to do."  
天城：“哇，这电击枪真是名不虚传。”

Koichi: "I knew it'd be worth the risk I took to steal it."  
小一：“我就知道冒这个险偷它是值得的。”

Asuka is completely numb and can't move at all, but she is still conscious...and afraid.  
明日香全身麻木，动弹不得，但她仍然清醒...并且感到害怕。

Asuka (to herself): "Where the hell is NERV Security when you need them!? Please don't let me be..."  
明日香（自言自语）：“关键时刻 NERV 保安都跑哪儿去了！？千万别让我……”

Koichi: "Now we're gonna have some fun with you, Sohryu. You're gonna pay for making me look like an idiot in front of everyone at the dance..."  
小一：“现在我们要好好玩玩你了，惣流。你让我在舞会上当众出丑，这账得算清楚……”

Asuka (to herself): "No...not by this bunch of morons!"  
明日香（自言自语）：“不……绝不能栽在这帮蠢货手里！”

Koichi: "What's wrong, Sohryu? Nothing to say, for once? Ha ha..."  
小一：“怎么了，惣流？难得无话可说吗？哈哈...”

Asuka (frowning and trying to open her mouth): "A...sss...asss... hole..."  
明日香（皱眉试图开口）：“混...混...混蛋...”

Koichi: "What's that? 'Asshole'? You want me to start there? What a little whore you are!"  
小一：“什么？‘混蛋’？你想让我从这里开始？你这个小贱人！”

The anger is rising inside Asuka.  
明日香的怒气正在心中升腾。

Shukaido: "We'll just wait here until you're done, Koichi."  
周回道：“我们就在这儿等你完事，小一。”

Koichi: "Fine by me. But don't hold your breath waiting."  
小一：“我无所谓。不过别憋着气等太久。”

He pulls out a flicknife, pops the blade out with a *snick* and shows it to Asuka.  
他掏出一把弹簧刀，随着一声*咔嚓*弹出刀片，向明日香展示。

Koichi: "I hate that ribbon around your collar..."  
小一：“我讨厌你领子上的那条丝带……”

He then slowly proceeds to cut through the ribbon of her school uniform.  
随后，他缓缓地开始割断她校服上的丝带。

Asuka (to herself): "NO! This can't be happening! MOVE, dammit! Why won't you move?"  
明日香（自言自语）：“不！这不可能！动啊，该死！为什么不动了？”

Koichi: "And I really hate those buttons on your blouse..."  
浩一：“还有，我真的很讨厌你衬衫上的那些扣子……”

He sticks the blade under each button and, with quick slices through the threads, sends them softly clicking to the cement. The blouse front opens, slowly revealing her bare skin and her red cotton bra underneath.  
他将刀片插入每个扣子下方，迅速划断线头，让扣子轻轻地咔哒咔哒落在水泥地上。衬衫前襟缓缓敞开，逐渐露出她裸露的肌肤和底下的红色棉质胸罩。

Koichi: "What a beautiful view..."  
小一：“真是美丽的景色啊……”

Asuka: "S...stop...that..."  
明日香：“别……别这样……”

Koichi: "Yes! Beg me to stop..."  
小一：“对！求我停下来……”

He then opens her blouse a bit wider and slides the straps of her dress off of her shoulders.  
随后，他轻轻将她的衬衫再敞开一些，顺势将裙子的肩带从她肩上滑落。

Tenchi: "Those are sure big, for a 14-year-old."  
天河：“对于一个 14 岁的孩子来说，真是挺大的。”

Koichi: "Let's see how soft they are..."  
浩一：“来看看它们有多柔软吧……”

He slowly puts one hand on her bra-clad breast, and begins to knead it. Asuka looks up at him, angry, terrified and helpless.  
他缓缓将一只手放在她穿着胸罩的胸部上，开始揉捏。明日香抬头看着他，愤怒、恐惧而又无助。

Koichi: "You like it, huh?"  
小一：“你喜欢这样，对吧？”

Shinji: "Asuka!" 真嗣：“明日香！”

The three boys turn their heads towards the end of the dark alley and see Shinji standing there, holding Asuka's schoolbag in his hand.  
三个男孩转头望向昏暗小巷的尽头，看见真嗣站在那里，手里拿着明日香的学校书包。

Shinji: "Get your filthy hands off her, you bastard!"  
真嗣：“把你那脏手从她身上拿开，混蛋！”

Koichi (taking his (filthy) hand off her): "What do you want, you little prick?"  
小池（把手（脏兮兮的）从她身上移开）：“你想怎样，小混蛋？”

Shinji (frowning): "I want you to leave her alone!"  
真嗣（皱眉）：“我希望你别再纠缠她了！”

Koichi (cracking his knuckles): "Well, that's too damn bad..."  
小一（扳动手指关节）：“哼，那可真是太糟糕了……”

Shukaido: "Err...Koichi..."  
修戒：“呃……小一……”

Koichi: "What?" 小一：“什么？”

Shukaido: "That boy...it's Ikari Shinji...I remember his face..."  
周海东：“那个男孩……是碇真嗣……我记得他的脸……”

Koichi (a bit scared): "What!? I thought the other team was taking care of him!"  
小一（有些害怕）：“什么！？我以为另一队正在处理他！”

Shinji stands there, smiling, confidantly. It's eerie. Koichi starts to get very nervous.  
真嗣站在那里，微笑着，自信满满。这情景让人毛骨悚然。小池开始感到非常紧张。

Shinji: "Don't ever underestimate NERV."  
真嗣：“永远不要小看 NERV。”

Koichi: "Sh-shut up!" 小池：“闭——闭嘴！”

Tenchi: "NERV security's prob'ly right behind him. We better run. Now."  
天河：“NERV 的安保人员可能就在他后面。我们最好快跑。现在。”

Koichi: "Y-yeah, I think so, too."  
小一：“嗯，我也这么认为。”

The three then turn around and run toward the other end of the alley. Shinji approaches Asuka, who is trying to sit up against the wall.  
三人随即转身向巷子的另一头跑去。真嗣走向试图靠墙坐起的明日香。

Shinji: "I'm sorry, Asuka..."  
真嗣：“对不起，明日香……”

Asuka: "Y...you i...diot..."  
明日香：“你……你这个……笨蛋……”

Shinji puts down Asuka's schoolbag, takes off his jacket and puts it over Asuka to hide her bare skin from view.  
真嗣放下明日香的书包，脱下自己的夹克，盖在明日香身上，遮住她裸露的肌肤。

Shinji: "Can you stand up?"  
真嗣："你能站起来吗？"

Asuka frowns, and painfully tries to get up. Seeing that she can barely stand up by herself, Shinji slides one of her arms around his shoulder and puts one of his around her waist to support her.  
明日香皱眉，痛苦地试图站起来。看到她几乎无法独自站立，真嗣将她的手臂搭在自己的肩膀上，并用手臂环住她的腰以支撑她。

Asuka: "You...stupid...your legs...are still weak..."  
明日香："你...笨蛋...你的腿...还很无力..."

Shinji: "They'll find the strength to carry you home, don't worry."  
真嗣：“他们会找到力量带你回家的，别担心。”

He picks up the schoolbag and stands up, bringing Asuka to her feet. When he looks at her again, he can see that she's crying.  
他捡起书包站起来，扶着明日香也站了起来。当他再次看向她时，发现她正在哭泣。

Shinji: "Did those guys hurt you?"  
真嗣：“那些家伙伤害你了吗？”

Asuka (weakly wiping her tears): "No...no harm done...they used a stun gun on me...I can hardly move..."  
明日香（无力地擦着眼泪）：“不...没事...他们用电击枪打了我...我现在几乎动不了...”

Shinji: "You should be okay soon..."  
真嗣：“你很快就会好的...”

Asuka (looking down): "I'm useless now..."  
明日香（低头）：“我现在真没用...”

Shinji (puzzled): "W-why are you saying that?"  
真嗣（困惑地）：“你为什么这么说？”

Asuka: "I bet they didn't know I'm an Eva pilot, too! All the things I did...all the efforts I made...to get noticed...to exist...useless!"  
明日香：“我打赌他们不知道我也是 EVA 驾驶员！我所做的一切……所有的努力……为了被注意到……为了存在……都是徒劳的！”

Shinji: "Asuka, you're not useless. Not to me, at least...I-I like being around you...and Misato and Hikari like you, too."  
真嗣：“明日香，你不是无用的。至少对我来说不是……我-我喜欢和你在一起……还有美里和光也喜欢你。”

Asuka: "It's not enough...!"  
明日香：“还不够...！”

Shinji: "Yes, it is. I had to step in and help you because I think you're worth helping. Really. I-"  
真嗣：“不，够了。我必须介入帮助你，因为我认为你值得帮助。真的。我-”

Asuka: "SHUT UP!" 明日香：“闭嘴！”

Shinji is surprised by Asuka's sudden outburst.  
真嗣对明日香的突然爆发感到惊讶。

Asuka (angrily): "Shut up! I don't want your goddamned pity!"  
明日香（愤怒地）：“闭嘴！我不需要你那该死的同情！”

Shinji: "Asuka, please calm down..."  
真嗣：“明日香，请冷静一下……”

Asuka: "I don't want it! I don't want anything..."  
明日香：“我不要！我什么都不想要……”

Her voice drops, and her eyes start to tear up again.  
她的声音低了下来，眼眶又开始泛起泪光。

Asuka: "I-I feel dirty...I don't feel pure anymore...I've been raped by those guys..."  
明日香：“我……我感觉好脏……我已经不再纯洁了……我被那些人侵犯了……”

Shinji: "You *could* have been, if I didn't see your schoolbag on the sidewalk, and didn't hear those guys say your name. But you weren't. You're all right. You're not dirty. It wasn't your fault this hap- pened, right? So don't worry about it...because I still care about you."  
真嗣：“你本可能会被他们欺负，如果不是我看到你的书包在人行道上，没听到那些人说你的名字。但你没事。你不脏。这不是你的错，对吧？所以别担心了...因为我仍然在乎你。”

Asuka looks up at him, hope starting to shine in her eyes.  
明日香抬头看着他，眼中开始闪烁希望的光芒。

Shinji: "I mean, you're beautiful, smart, and all that...but I don't like you just for that. I don't like you like all the other boys do. You're my fellow pilot first, and you're a girl I want to be with... who I want to protect. Do you understand what I mean?"  
真嗣：“我的意思是，你既美丽又聪明，还有其他优点...但我不仅仅因为这些喜欢你。我和其他男孩不一样。你首先是我的战友，然后是我想要陪伴的女孩...是我想要保护的人。你明白我的意思吗？”

Asuka (now frowning): "...I told you, I don't want your pity..."  
明日香（现皱眉）：“……我告诉过你，我不需要你的同情……”

Shinji: "Please stop saying that! Stop it! It's human to accept pity. Pity is love, too! Well, that's what I think..."  
真嗣：“请不要再这样说了！停下来！接受同情是人之常情。同情也是爱的一种！至少我是这么认为的……”

Asuka: "I don't know why I still care...if only I'd left you in your damned wheelchair that time...none of this would have happened!"  
明日香：“我不知道为什么我还在乎……如果那时我只让你留在那该死的轮椅上……这一切都不会发生！”

Shinji: "Don't tell me you regret taking care of me like you did. I don't believe that! Not with everything you said and did afterwards!"  
真嗣：“别告诉我你后悔像那样照顾我了。我不相信！尤其是你之后所说所做的一切！”

Asuka: "...maybe I'm just lying to myself..."  
明日香：“……也许我只是在自欺欺人……”

Shinji: "We all do that sometimes. Life often hurts...and until recently, I was running away from mine. Then you showed me that you cared about me. It showed me that life was worth living. I don't know if what I'm saying really makes sense, but...that's what I think."  
真嗣：“我们都有这样的时候。生活常常很痛苦……直到最近，我还在逃避我的生活。然后你向我展示了你对我的关心。这让我意识到生活是值得过的。我不知道我说的这些是否真的有意义，但……这就是我的想法。”

Asuka: "Maybe that's what I'm doing. Running away."  
明日香：“或许我就是在逃避。”

Shinji: "Really, there's other things to life than piloting Eva and all."  
真嗣：“说真的，生活里不只有驾驶 EVA 这一件事。”

Asuka: "Maybe you're right."  
明日香：“也许你是对的。”

Shinji (a little more upbeat): "Of course I'm right!" (more serious now:) "But still...why do you keep on ignoring me or insulting me when we're around other people?"  
真嗣（略显振奋）：“我当然是对的！”（现在更严肃了：）“但是……为什么当我们周围有其他人时，你总是忽视我或侮辱我呢？”

Asuka (sighing): "I'm sorry for treating you so badly. I guess you know how I feel, too..."  
明日香（叹气）：“对不起，我对你太差劲了。我想你也能理解我的感受……”

Shinji slowly nods. 真嗣缓缓地点了点头。

Asuka: "All those feelings and emotions, I only want you to know them. I don't want to show everyone what I feel for you. I believe that... being nice to you...kissing you...and sleeping by your side are too personal for other people, even Misato, to know about..."  
明日香：“所有这些情感，我只希望你知道。我不想向所有人展示我对你的感情。我相信...对你好...吻你...还有睡在你身边，这些都太过私密，不应该让别人知道，即使是美里也一样...”

With that, she tenderly kisses his cheek.  
说完，她温柔地吻了他的脸颊。

Shinji: "I see...and I agree with you, Asuka. I was such an idiot during all this. I couldn't see what you were trying to tell me."  
真嗣：“我明白了...我同意你的看法，明日香。我在这期间真是太愚蠢了。我没能理解你试图告诉我的。”

Asuka: "It's all right now."  
明日香：“现在没事了。”

Shinji: "On my way back from school, I was attacked by four guys... I heard them talking about you and it really scared me...that's when the NERV security agents showed up and took care of them. So I was able to get away and search for you...I was really worried..."  
真嗣：“放学回家的路上，我被四个家伙袭击了……我听到他们谈论你，真的很害怕……那时 NERV 的保安人员出现了，把他们制服了。所以我才能逃脱并寻找你……我真的很担心……”

Asuka: "So...that's was why there weren't any security agents around at that moment..."  
明日香：“原来……那就是为什么那时候周围没有保安人员的原因……”

Shinji: "Yeah. The guys who attacked me were probably used to throw them off of what was really happening."  
真嗣：“嗯。袭击我的那些人可能是用来转移视线的，让人忽视真正发生的事情。”

Asuka (sighing): "Don't worry, Shinji. No one will get to see and touch your birthday present but you."  
明日香（叹气）：“别担心，真嗣。除了你，没人能看到或触碰你的生日礼物。”

Shinji (surprised): "You...you knew!?"  
真嗣（惊讶）：“你……你知道了！？”

Asuka (smiling slightly): "Of course, idiot. How could I could forget that?"  
明日香（微微一笑）：“当然，傻瓜。我怎么可能忘记那个呢？”

Shinji: "It's just that...I've never really gotten a birthday present before..."  
真嗣：“只是……我以前从没真正收到过生日礼物……”

Asuka: "I have one for you...but it's only for tonight. Because tonight, I planned something special."  
明日香：“我给你准备了一个……但只在今晚。因为今晚，我安排了特别的惊喜。”

The apartment, a little later. The front door slides open to reveal Asuka with an arm still around Shinji's shoulder.  
稍晚些时候的公寓里。前门滑开，只见明日香仍一手搭在真嗣的肩上。

Asuka: "It's okay...I think I can walk by myself now...I can feel my legs again."  
明日香：“没事了……我想我现在可以自己走了……腿又有知觉了。”

Shinji: "That's nice to hear."  
真嗣：“听到这个真好。”

Shinji lets go of Asuka, and she slowly, carefully walks towards the kitchen. She stops at the entranceway and turns around to face Shinji.  
真嗣放开了明日香，她缓缓地、小心翼翼地走向厨房。她在入口处停下，转身面向真嗣。

Asuka (happily): "You see?"  
明日香（高兴地）：“看到了吧？”

Shinji (smiling): "Yeah. I'm gonna go lie down on the couch. My legs really hurt."  
真嗣（微笑着）：“嗯。我得去沙发上躺会儿，腿真的好疼。”

Asuka: "Okay. I hope they'll be all right later this evening!"  
明日香："好的。希望他们今晚晚些时候能没事！"

Shinji (to himself): "What?"  
真嗣（自言自语）："什么？"

Asuka: "But now I'm going to make dinner for tonight."  
明日香："但现在我要去准备今晚的晚餐了。"

Shinji: "Really!?" 真嗣："真的！？"

Asuka: "Why are you so surprised about that? Is something wrong?!"  
明日香："你为什么这么惊讶？有什么问题吗？！"

Shinji (trying to defend himself): "No, no! It's nothing, really! It's just the first time you've ever made dinner for me."  
真嗣（试图为自己辩解）："不，不！没什么，真的！只是你第一次为我做晚饭。"

Asuka (rolling up her sleeves): "You'll see what a Sohryu can do!"  
明日香（卷起袖子）：“让你见识一下苍龙的力量！”

Shinji smiles, and, without another word, flops down on the couch and takes a nap.  
真嗣微笑着，没有多说一句话，便倒在沙发上打起了盹。

Some time later... 过了一会儿……

Asuka: "Shinji...wake up..."  
明日香：“真嗣...醒醒...”

Shinji slowly opens his eyes, to be greeted by a close view of Asuka's face. She's leaning over him.  
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，映入眼帘的是明日香近在咫尺的脸庞。她正俯身看着他。

Shinji: "Asuka? What time is it?"  
真嗣：“明日香？现在几点了？”

Asuka: "You slept for nearly three hours..."  
明日香："你睡了将近三个小时……"

Shinji: "Oh..." 真嗣："哦……"

As he gets a better look at her, he notices that she's not in her school uniform anymore.  
当他更仔细地观察她时，注意到她已经不再穿着校服了。

Shinji: "Where did you get that dress?"  
真嗣：“你从哪儿弄来那件裙子的？”

Asuka: "Idiot, I have a lot of different dresses in my wardrobe."  
明日香：“笨蛋，我的衣柜里有很多不同款式的裙子。”

Shinji: "I didn't know you had such a nice evening dress."  
真嗣：“我都不知道你还有这么漂亮的晚礼服。”

Indeed, Asuka is wearing a sexy sleeveless red dress.  
确实，明日香穿着一件性感的无袖红色连衣裙。

Shinji: "And why did you turn off all the lights?"  
"真嗣：“那你为什么把所有的灯都关了？””

Asuka: "Come into the kitchen, and you'll see..."  
"明日香：“来厨房你就知道了……””

He slowly gets up from the couch and follows Asuka's feminine silhouette to the kitchen. There, he is greeted by the sight of a fully-arranged kitchen table, softly lit by two candles.  
他缓缓从沙发上起身，跟随明日香婀娜的身影来到厨房。在那里，他被一张布置整齐的餐桌迎接，两支蜡烛柔和地照亮了四周。

Asuka: "Take a seat." 明日香：“坐吧。”

Shinji sits down, and Asuka seats herself across from him. He looks down at the food she prepared for him.  
真嗣坐下，明日香则坐在他对面。他低头看着她为他准备的食物。

Shinji (surprised): "Curry?"  
真嗣（惊讶地）：“咖喱？”

Asuka: "I didn't know what else to make, and I didn't want to try to cook something too difficult, so..."  
明日香：“我不知道还能做什么，也不想尝试做太难的菜，所以……”

Shinji: "That's okay..." 真嗣：“没关系……”

Asuka: "Good." 明日香："好的。"

Shinji: "Itedakimasu [I will receive it]."  
真嗣："いただきます[我开动了]。"

Shinji picks up his spoon, takes a bit of his curry, and tastes it.  
真嗣拿起勺子，舀了一口咖喱，尝了尝。

Shinji (gulping): "Your cooking is really nice."  
Shinji（咽口水）：“你做的菜真好吃。”

Asuka: "You think so? To tell the truth, I haven't tasted it yet."  
Asuka：“你这么认为吗？说实话，我自己还没尝过呢。”

Seeing that Shinji seems to be enjoying each bite he's eating, Asuka decided to try herself. As she puts her spoon in her mouth, she twitches a bit and her left eyebrow arches.  
看到 Shinji 似乎每一口都吃得津津有味，Asuka 决定自己也尝一尝。当她把勺子放进嘴里时，她微微一颤，左眉挑起。

Asuka (to herself): "But this...this is TERRIBLE! How can he like this?! What have I cooked!? I'm worse than Misato!"  
明日香（自言自语）：“但这……这太糟糕了！他怎么会喜欢这个？！我做了什么？！我比美里还差劲！”

She then looks at him again. He is indeed enjoying the meal she cooked for him, much to her disbelief...  
她再次看向他。他确实在享受她为他做的饭菜，这让她难以置信……

Asuka (looking down): "Shinji, be honest with me. If you don't want to eat this, don't force yourself. And you can say it: It's awful."  
明日香（低头）：“真嗣，对我实话实说。如果你不想吃这个，不要勉强自己。你可以直说：它很难吃。”

Shinji looks up at her and stops eating.  
真嗣抬头看着她，停止了进食。

Shinji: "I think that, since you put a lot of effort into making this, it makes it better than it looks or tastes. To me, everything you'll ever cook will be good, because it's something you did by yourself... it's like you're giving a part of yourself to me."  
真嗣：“我认为，既然你付出了很多努力来制作这个，它就比它看起来或尝起来的更好。对我来说，你做的每一样菜都会很好，因为这是你自己做的……就像你给了我一部分自己一样。”

Asuka is speechless. 明日香无言以对。

Shinji: "Really." 真嗣："真的。"

Asuka: "I-if you say so..."  
明日香："如果你这么说的话……"

They continue to eat in silence. She still feels uneasy about her cooking, though, and it casts a pall over her face. Shinji reads her look as being about what happened earlier, and he speaks up.  
他们继续默默地吃饭。她对自己的烹饪仍然感到不安，这使她的脸上蒙上了一层阴影。真嗣将她的表情解读为关于之前发生的事情，于是他开口了。

Shinji: "Asuka...sorry for bringing this up so suddenly now, but... did you knew those guys?"  
真嗣：“明日香...抱歉现在突然提起这件事，但是...你认识那些人吗？”

Asuka (looking down a bit): "Oh...yeah...one of them was the guy I dumped for you at the school dance. He wanted to get revenge..."  
明日香（略显低落地）：“哦...是的...其中一个是在学校舞会上我为了你而甩掉的男生。他想报复...”

Shinji: "Damn...if I ever see them again..."  
真嗣：“该死...如果我再见到他们...”

He clenches and unclenches his fist as the anger spreads over his face.  
他紧握又松开拳头，愤怒之情在脸上蔓延开来。

Asuka (with a worried look): "Calm down, Shinji. It's over now. It was terrible, but...I feel better about it now, because you came for me and you stopped them."  
明日香（面带忧色）：“冷静点，真嗣。现在都结束了。虽然很糟糕，但是……因为你来救我，阻止了他们，我现在感觉好多了。”

Shinji: "Yeah...sorry." (flustered:) "I-I mean, about getting mad just now..."  
真嗣：“嗯……对不起。”（慌张地）“我……我是说，刚才发火的事……”

Asuka (angrily): "Damn, I hate it when you apologize for insignificant things like that!"  
明日香（愤怒地）：“该死，我最讨厌你为这种鸡毛蒜皮的小事道歉了！”

Shinji: "Sor-" 真嗣：“对……”

Asuka is throwing a death glare at him. Shinji, for some strange reason, bursts out laughing. Asuka's brow furrows in confusion.  
明日香正用死亡凝视瞪着他。不知为何，真嗣突然大笑起来。明日香的眉头因困惑而紧皱。

Shinji (still laughing a little): "You may like to insult me and all that, but there's something I like to do as well: Make you angry! God, you're so cute when...ha ha ha ha!"  
真嗣（仍带着笑意）：“你或许喜欢侮辱我什么的，但我也有个爱好：惹你生气！天哪，你生气的样子真是太可爱了……哈哈哈哈！”

Asuka (realizing): "Wait, you little...!"  
明日香（恍然大悟）：“等等，你这个小……！”

Asuka starts to get up out of her chair, then remembers what he just said, settles down and fumes a bit. Shinji laughs again a little, calms down and goes back to his dinner.  
明日香本想起身离开椅子，但想起他刚才的话，又坐了回去，气鼓鼓地。真嗣再次轻笑一声，平静下来，继续吃他的晚餐。

Shinji (calming down and finishing eating): "Gochisousama deshita [Thank you for the feast]. That was good, Asuka. Your cooking's not the best, but it's good."  
Shinji (平静下来并吃完后): "多谢款待。那真不错，明日香。虽然你的厨艺不是最好的，但已经很好了。"

Asuka (standing up): "I still need more practice. Stay there, I'll be right back."  
Asuka (站起来): "我还需要多练习。你坐那儿别动，我马上回来。"

She then turns and walks to a part of the kitchen not lit up by the candles. She comes back with a big platter in her hands and sets it down on the table between them.  
随后她转身走向厨房中未被蜡烛照亮的一角。她带着一个大盘子回来，将其放在两人之间的桌子上。

Asuka (happily): "Jyaaaaaan!"  
明日香（开心地）："嗷呜——！"

Shinji is speechless. A huge, luscious, and appetizing chocolate cake is sitting in front of him. On it stand fifteen candles, which Asuka is now lighting with a match.  
真嗣无言以对。一个巨大、诱人且令人垂涎的巧克力蛋糕摆在他面前。上面插着十五根蜡烛，此刻，明日香正用火柴点燃它们。

Shinji: "You...you..." 真嗣："你...你..."

Asuka (lighting the last candle): "I hope this'll be better than the curry was."  
明日香（点燃最后一根蜡烛）：“希望这比咖喱好些。”

Shinji: "Wow...It looks great! I-I'm impressed!"  
真嗣：“哇...看起来真棒！我...我真的很佩服！”

Asuka: "Happy birthday, Ikari Shinji!"  
明日香：“生日快乐，碇真嗣！”

Shinji (stunned): "I still can't believe this!"  
真嗣（震惊）：“我还是不敢相信这是真的！”

Asuka (grinning): "Come on, blow the candles out! If you can blow all fifteen of them out at once, you may get a nice reward..."  
明日香（咧嘴笑）：“快点，吹蜡烛吧！如果你能一口气吹灭十五根，说不定会有好奖励哦……”

Shinji: "Okay..." 真嗣：“好吧……”

He takes a deep breath, and, with one long, slow puff, blows out every candle on the cake. As he closes his eyes and begins to recover, he can hear clapping. He opens his eyes again.  
他深吸一口气，然后缓缓地吹出，将蛋糕上的每一根蜡烛都吹灭了。当他闭上眼睛开始恢复时，能听到掌声。他再次睁开了眼睛。

Asuka (applauding): "Congratulations, Shinji." (now grinning:) "I'm sure you'll appreciate the reward very much...but that's for the third part of the evening!"  
明日香（鼓掌）：“恭喜你，真嗣。”（现在咧嘴笑道：）“我相信你会非常喜欢那个奖励的...不过那是今晚第三部分的内容了！”

She giggles. 她咯咯地笑了起来。

Shinji: "Really? What is it?"  
真嗣："真的吗？是什么？"

Asuka (calming down a bit): "It's a surprise. You'll see!"  
明日香（稍微平静下来）："这是个惊喜。你马上就知道了！"

Asuka pulls the candles out of the cake. She then cuts the cake into eight equal portions with a large knife.  
明日香从蛋糕上拔掉蜡烛。随后，她用一把大刀将蛋糕均匀地切成八份。

Shinji: "Don't you think this is...a bit too much for just the two of us?"  
真嗣：“你不觉得这对我们两个人来说...有点太多了吗？”

Asuka grins as she puts a slice on a dessert plate with a spatula and sets it in front of Shinji.  
明日香咧嘴一笑，用铲子将一片蛋糕放在甜点盘上，然后摆在真嗣面前。

Asuka: "I'm sure you'll want to eat it all..."  
明日香：“我肯定你会想把它全部吃掉的...”

Shinji (smiling): "Let's see about that."  
真嗣（微笑着）：“那就看看吧。”

He picks up his fork, takes a piece of the cake, pops it into his mouth, and chews it slowly and carefully before swallowing it. And then smiles.  
他拿起叉子，叉起一块蛋糕，放入口中，慢慢地仔细咀嚼后咽下，然后露出了笑容。

Shinji: "Excellent!" 真嗣：“太棒了！”

Asuka (smiling): "Let's see if you're lying or not..."  
明日香（微笑着）：“看看你是不是在撒谎……”

She takes a bite of her own slice.  
她咬了一口自己的那片。

Asuka: "Hmmm...you're right! This is great!"  
明日香：“嗯……你说得对！这个真好吃！”

Shinji: "See? You're not as bad as you say you are!"  
真嗣：“看吧？你并没有自己说的那么糟糕！”

Shinji quickly finishes his portion. Asuka reaches for the spatula so she can give him another slice, but he gestures and quickly swallows his last bite.  
真嗣迅速吃完自己的那份。明日香伸手去拿铲子想再给他切一块，但他摆了摆手，迅速咽下了最后一口。

Shinji: "Thanks, but I don't think I can eat any more of this cake. I mean, it's great, but it's just a bit too...rich for me."  
真嗣：“谢谢，但我觉得我不能再吃这个蛋糕了。我是说，它很棒，只是对我来说有点太……油腻了。”

Asuka (chuckling): "Oops, I forgot that you have a Japanese stomach!"  
明日香（轻笑）：“哎呀，忘了你的胃是日本胃了！”

Shinji: "Yeah..." 真嗣：“嗯……”

Asuka: "Okay, I won't let you just sit there watching me eat my cake. We can have more later..."  
明日香：“好吧，不会让你干坐着看我吃蛋糕的。我们待会儿可以再吃些……”

With that, she stands up. Shinji stands up, as well, and takes the hand that Asuka is holding out to him.  
说完，她站了起来。真嗣也跟着起身，握住了明日香伸向他的手。

Shinji: "So, what's next?"  
真嗣：“接下来做什么？”

Asuka: "Are your legs okay?"  
明日香：“你的腿还好吗？”

Shinji: "I think they are."  
真嗣：“我想是的。”

Asuka: "Then, let me remind you that I still owe you a dance. And I hate to be in debt to anyone."  
明日香：“那么，让我提醒你，我还欠你一支舞。我讨厌欠任何人东西。”

Shinji: "Yeah, that's right. I remember. I guess you planned every- thing for that as well."  
真嗣：“嗯，没错。我记得。我猜你也为那件事计划好了一切。”

Asuka: "Of course!" 明日香："当然！"

Shinji follows Asuka into the living room, where she had moved her SoundSpace(tm) audio system from her bedroom. She walks over to the system and pushes the play button of the DAD [Digital Audio Disc] player. Soon, the living room is filled with a soft and slow song. A tune from the late 90's, from what Shinji can remember of his limited knowledge of pop songs.  
真嗣跟着明日香走进客厅，她已经把她的 SoundSpace(tm)音响系统从卧室搬到了这里。她走到音响前，按下了数字音频光盘播放器的播放键。很快，客厅里充满了柔和缓慢的旋律。这是一首 90 年代末的曲子，真嗣根据自己对流行歌曲有限的了解回忆道。

Asuka (holding out her arms to him): "Shall we dance?"  
明日香（向他伸出双臂）："要跳舞吗？"

Shinji is a bit surprised by the sudden change of atmosphere. Especially in Asuka's mood and actions.  
真嗣对气氛的突然变化感到有些惊讶。尤其是明日香的情绪和行为。

Shinji: "Errr...sure." 真嗣："呃...当然。"

Shinji approaches Asuka, and before he realizes it, he's lost in her beautiful blue eyes. Those two blue orbs that would cry sometimes, smile sometimes, shine with excitement and rage during Angel battles... the windows to her soul that could keep him busy for ages just looking into them...Asuka puts her hands on his shoulders, and looks right into his own eyes with a smile. Shinji then slowly wraps his arms around Asuka's waist, holding her firmly, but still gently, close to him. They both start to slowly sway and turn to the music.  
真嗣走近明日香，不知不觉中，他迷失在她那双美丽的蓝眼睛里。那两颗时而哭泣、时而微笑、在与使徒战斗中闪烁着兴奋与愤怒的蓝色宝石...那能让他凝视许久、窥探她灵魂深处的窗户...明日香将双手放在他的肩上，微笑着直视他的眼睛。真嗣随后缓缓地搂住明日香的腰，紧紧地、却又温柔地拥她入怀。两人随着音乐开始缓缓摇摆、旋转。

Asuka (softly): "Well, you're not a bad dancer..."  
明日香（轻声地）：“嗯，你跳舞其实也不赖……”

Shinji: "It's not that difficult, actua-"  
真嗣：“其实也没那么难，真的——”

Asuka interrupts him by slowly placing a finger on his lips.  
明日香用手指轻轻按住他的嘴唇，打断了他的话。

Asuka: "Sssshhh...let's just dance now..."  
明日香："嘘...现在我们只管跳舞吧..."

She then gently takes her hands off of Shinji's shoulders, and folds her arms around the back of his neck. She draws closer to him, and finally rests her head on his left shoulder. Shinji brushes some of Asuka's hair off his face, and continues dancing. The tracks from Asuka's DAD player slowly and softly unfold from the speakers, all blurring into one single dimension where things like plaster casts and alleys no longer exist. Before either of them know it, the player reaches track 9, and begins to fill the room with Megumi Hayashibara's "Alchemy Of Love."  
随后，她轻柔地从真嗣的肩膀上移开双手，双臂环绕至他的颈后。她向他靠近，最终将头靠在他的左肩上。真嗣轻拂开挡在脸上的明日香的发丝，继续共舞。明日香的 DAD 播放器中，曲目缓缓而柔和地从扬声器中流淌出来，一切都融入了单一的维度，那里不再有石膏模型和巷弄的存在。不知不觉间，播放器跳到了第 9 首曲目，房间里开始弥漫着林原惠美的《爱的炼金术》。

Shinji: "It's strange...don't you think this singer's voice sounds like Ayanami's?"  
真嗣："真奇怪...你不觉得这位歌手的声音很像绫波吗？"

Asuka: "Errr...what?" 明日香：“呃...什么？”

Shinji (softly): "Just listen..."  
真嗣（轻声）：“就听听吧……”

Asuka: "Yeah, you're right. That's funny. I never noticed that before..."  
明日香：“嗯，你说得对。真有趣，我以前从没注意到过……”

The lights in the room were turned down to the strict minimum, making it hard to distinguish the two silhouettes slowly gliding across the room. It's even harder due to the face they are so close to each other, one could swear it was only one person dancing, alone...they danced, danced, danced until the DAD player reached track 19. They didn't care how long they danced, how much Shinji's legs were aching, or if Misato was coming back now. For them, time simply ground to a halt...as they hugged each other tightly, Asuka spoke.  
房间里的灯光被调至最低限度，使得两个缓缓滑过房间的身影难以辨认。更因他们彼此间距离如此之近，旁人几乎会以为是一个人在独自起舞...他们舞动着，舞动着，直到 DAD 播放器跳至第 19 首曲目。他们不在乎跳舞多久，不在乎真嗣的双腿如何酸痛，也不在乎美里是否即将归来。对他们而言，时间仿佛停滞了...紧紧相拥之际，明日香开口了。

Asuka (softly): "Shinji...?"  
明日香（轻声）：“真嗣...？”

Shinji: "Yes?" 真嗣：“嗯？”

Asuka: "Let's go to your room. I'm...tired."  
明日香：“我们去你的房间吧。我……累了。”

Shinji (nodding): "Sure..."  
真嗣（点头）：“好的……”

They slowly release each other from their tight embrace, and go to Shinji's room. After Shinji enters the room, Asuka locks the door behind him.  
他们缓缓地从紧紧的拥抱中松开彼此，走向真嗣的房间。真嗣进屋后，明日香在他身后锁上了门。

Asuka: "Lay down on the bed, and close your eyes, okay?"  
明日香：“躺在床上，闭上眼睛，好吗？”

Shinji doesn't really know what she's going to do, but he obeys her.  
真嗣并不清楚她要做什么，但还是照做了。

Asuka: "And keep them closed..."  
明日香：“保持闭着哦……”

Shinji does as he was told. Once he lays down on the bed, where he can finally rest his legs a little, he closes his eyes. His curiosity tells him to peek, but his gentlemanly side tells him to keep them closed, as Asuka told him to. But the rustling he hears isn't helping at all. Before long, the rustling stops, and he can feel another weight on the bed. He opens his eyes wide when he then feels a pair of lips against his. Asuka is indeed planting a passionate kiss on his lips...  
真嗣按照吩咐行事。当他躺到床上，终于能让双腿稍作休息时，他闭上了眼睛。好奇心驱使他偷看，但绅士的一面告诉他要遵从明日香的指示，保持闭眼。然而，他听到的窸窣声丝毫没有帮助。不久，窸窣声停止了，他能感觉到床上又多了一份重量。当他感觉到一对唇贴上来时，他猛地睁大了眼睛。明日香确实正在热情地吻他……

Shinji (looking down): "A...Asuka!"  
真嗣（低头）：“明……明日香！”

Asuka (beginning to gently nibble his neck): "This is my birthday present to you, Shinji..."  
明日香（开始轻柔地啃咬他的脖子）：“这是给你的生日礼物，真嗣……”

As Shinji looks down, he can swear that his heart had just missed a beat or two. Asuka is completely naked, and lying on top of his body with all her weight. He is unable to get away, even if he wants to. When he finally recovers his senses, Asuka had already unbuttoned his shirt, and was now undoing his belt.  
当真嗣低头一看，他敢发誓自己的心跳刚刚漏了一两拍。明日香一丝不挂，全身重量都压在他身上。他想逃也逃不掉。等他回过神来，明日香已经解开了他的衬衫扣子，现在正解着他的皮带。

Shinji: "Asuka...do you really think that..."  
真嗣：“明日香……你真的觉得……”

Asuka cuts him off by kissing him passionately again, this time with her tongue forcing its way inside his mouth, and sensually caressing his. She slowly breaks the kiss after a few seconds.  
明日香再次热情地吻住他，打断了他的话，这次她的舌头强行探入他的口中，温柔地挑逗着他的。几秒后，她缓缓结束了这个吻。

Asuka: "Isn't this a nice present?"  
明日香：“这不是一份很棒的礼物吗？”

Shinji: "I think we're a bit too young for this..."  
真嗣：“我觉得我们还是有点太小了……”

Asuka: "There has to be a first time for everything...and this first time...I want it to be with you. I want to love you. I want to prove it..."  
明日香：“凡事总有第一次……而这一次，我想和你一起。我想爱你。我想证明这一点……”

Shinji: "You're sure you won't regret it...?"  
真嗣：“你确定不会后悔吗...？”

Asuka: "Oh, no, I won't...I'm sure I won't...Shinji...please..."  
明日香：“哦，不，我不会...我确定我不会...真嗣...请...”

With those last words, she plants another short and soft kiss on his lips.  
随着这最后的话语，她再次在他的唇上轻轻地印下一个短暂而温柔的吻。

Shinji: "But, what about..."  
真嗣："但是，那怎么办..."

Asuka reaches for his nightstand, picks something up from it and holds it up. It was the condom she had bought earlier that day. Shinji is surprised, since he knows he never bought one in his life. She did that...for him.  
明日香伸手去拿他的床头柜，从中拿起一样东西并举起来。那是她那天早些时候买的避孕套。真嗣感到惊讶，因为他知道自己这辈子从未买过。她这么做...是为了他。

Asuka (softly): "Don't worry about that...I thought about that today." (smiling:) "I mean, there's some risks even *I* won't take."  
明日香（轻声地）："别担心那个...我今天考虑过了。"（微笑着）："我是说，有些风险连我也不会去冒。"

Shinji: "Well, if we don't have to worry about that...than I really want to show you how much I love you, too. But aren't you a bit scared?"  
真嗣：“好吧，如果我们不用担心那个……那我真的想让你知道我有多爱你。但你不会有点害怕吗？”

Asuka: "Scared? Why should I be? I trust you. I know you would never try to hurt me..."  
明日香：“害怕？我为什么要害怕？我相信你。我知道你永远不会试图伤害我……”

Shinji (whispering into her ear): "I won't. Never."  
真嗣（在她耳边低语）：“我不会的。永远不会。”

Shinji starts to nibble Asuka's neck like she had his earlier, and before too long Sohryu Asuka Langley and Ikari Shinji broke through the world of childlike purity and innocence, into a universe of love and ultimate trust. One that was so far away, but so close to them. They were only vaguely familiar with it before, but now that they had led each other there in each other's arms, they knew that they had found something they had never felt before...a sense of belonging. To each other. An English song by a band from the 1980's can be heard from the living room now...  
真嗣开始像她之前那样轻咬明日香的脖子，不久后，惣流·明日香·兰格雷与碇真嗣便突破了孩童般的纯洁与天真，进入了一个充满爱与绝对信任的宇宙。那个世界虽遥不可及，却又近在咫尺。他们之前只是隐约熟悉，但现在，在彼此的怀抱中引领对方到达那里，他们知道找到了一种前所未有的感觉——归属感。属于彼此。此时，客厅里传来了一首 80 年代英国乐队的英文歌曲……

"I'll stop the world and melt with you I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the time There's nothing you and I won't do I'll stop the world and melt with you The future's open wide..."  
“我将让世界停下，与你一同融化 我已见证变化，但一切正变得越来越好 你我之间，无所不为 我将让世界停下，与你一同融化 未来广阔无垠……”

- THE END? - - 终？ -

Author's notes: 作者的话：

I think I'm gonna see a LOT of complaints about the near-rape scene. Sorry about that, but I think it had to be done...  
我想关于那场近乎强奸的场景，我会收到很多抱怨。对此我很抱歉，但我认为这是必要的...

And remember to always use a condom, m'kay? :)  
还有，记得始终使用避孕套哦，好吗？ :)

Special thanks goes to Alain Gravel, RG-01, Cedric Ranson, Dave Watson, and EBJ! Thank you all for the invaluable help in this fic!

Retooler's notes: 修订者注：

Any similarities between this fic and my Video Girl Ai limefic "Past the Return Date" are purely coincidental. Or so Axel says dB). I'll have to take him at his word here. Whatever the case is, I most definitely did not stick them in to refer to my own work. In fact, I bugged Axel to take out the part about Megumi Hayashibara's singing sounding like one of the characters she voice-acts, but he insisted on keeping it in. So BLAME HIM! dB)  
此文与我的《电影少女》青涩小说《过期不候》之间的任何相似之处纯属巧合。至少阿克塞尔是这么说的(dB)。我得相信他的话。不管怎样，我绝不是故意将这些内容插入以提及自己的作品。实际上，我曾烦请阿克塞尔删去有关林原惠美歌声听起来像她配音角色之一的描述，但他坚持保留。所以，怪他吧！(dB)

As I retooled the last part of the fic, I was listening to the 4AD Records promo compilation CD _Clipped and Clustered_, and the Modern English song "I Melt With You" was playing. The chorus near the end of the song matched the mood of the ending so well that I couldn't help but include it here. The song is written by Modern English, published by Beggars Banquet Music, and available on the album _After the Snow._ If anybody involved in the above entities are reading this, the lyrics are used without permission, but, for Belldandy's sake, you got proper credit and a plug, no one is making money off this story and Axel and I are so poor it wouldn't be worth the lawyer's fees to sue us, so please don't do an Oasis on us, okay?  
在修改小说的最后部分时，我正听着 4AD 唱片公司的宣传合辑 CD《剪辑与聚合》，其中现代英语乐队的歌曲《与你融化》正在播放。歌曲接近尾声时的副歌与结尾的氛围如此契合，以至于我忍不住将其融入文中。该歌曲由现代英语乐队创作，由乞丐盛宴音乐出版，收录于专辑《雪后》。如果上述任何相关人士正在阅读此文，歌词未经允许使用，但看在贝尔丹迪的份上，你们得到了应有的认可和宣传，没有人通过这个故事获利，阿克塞尔和我穷得连律师费都不值得，所以请不要像对待绿洲乐队那样对待我们，好吗？

CAPTION: EPILOGUE CAPTION 2: (yeah, another one :) )  
标题: 后记 标题 2: (对，再来一个 :) )

Early the next morning. Asuka is back in her red sleeveless evening dress, and is silently leaving Shinji's room. Just as she is going back to her room, she sees Misato slumped on the kitchen table.  
第二天一大早，明日香穿着她那件红色的无袖晚礼服，默默地离开了真嗣的房间。就在她准备回自己房间时，看到美里趴在厨房的桌子上。

Asuka: "Why is she sleeping there?"  
明日香：“她怎么睡在那里？”

She looks closer and sees that there are now only two slices of chocolate cake left on the platter, plus an empty beer can nearby. She then understands what happened.  
她走近一看，发现盘子里只剩下两片巧克力蛋糕，旁边还有一个空的啤酒罐。这时，她明白了发生了什么。

Asuka (sighing): "Ach, Gott [Oh, god]..."  
明日香（叹气）：“啊，天哪 [Ach, Gott]..."

She walks up to Misato and shakes her by the shoulder.  
她走向美里，摇了摇她的肩膀。

Asuka: "Misato, wake up!"  
明日香：“美里，醒醒！”

Misato (slowly waking up): "Hmmmmmmmm..."  
葛城（缓缓醒来）：“嗯～～～～～～～～”

Asuka: "Wake up, I said!"  
明日香：“我说了，快醒醒！”

Misato looks up at Asuka.  
葛城抬头看向明日香。

Misato: "What am I doing there?"  
葛城：“我在那里做什么？”

Asuka: "You ate most of Shinji's birthday cake, you idiot!"  
明日香：“你吃了真嗣大部分的生日蛋糕，你这个笨蛋！”

Misato: "Oh, it was for Shinji...oops..."  
葛城：“哦，那是给真嗣的...哎呀...”

Asuka: "You're going to get fat!"  
明日香："你要变胖了！"

Misato (giggling): "Well, I couldn't help it. I musta had the beer munchies when I got home, and this just looked so good. Tasted good, too."  
美里（咯咯笑）："哎呀，我也没办法。回家时一定是啤酒馋虫上脑了，这东西看起来太诱人了。味道也不错。"

She rolls her tongue around inside her mouth and frowns at the combination of beer hangover and chocolate on her breath.  
她用舌头在嘴里转了一圈，皱着眉头感受着啤酒宿醉和巧克力混合在口气中的味道。

Misato: "Ugh. Doesn't taste so good now, though."  
葛城：“呃，现在尝起来不怎么样了。”

Asuka sweatdrops a little.  
明日香有点冒汗。

Misato (more serious): "What are you doing in that evening dress so early in the (yawn) morning? You sleep with him again?"  
葛城（更严肃地）：“这么一大早穿着晚礼服干什么？你又和他睡了？”

Asuka begins to walk towards her room.  
明日香开始向她的房间走去。

Misato: "Why?" 美里：“为什么？”

Asuka stops and answers Misato without turning around.  
明日香停下脚步，没有回头地回答美里。

Asuka: "Because I love him, Misato. I love Shinji with all my heart."  
明日香：“因为我爱他，美里。我全心全意地爱着真嗣。”

Pause. Asuka starts walking towards her room again.  
停顿。明日香再次向她的房间走去。

Misato (smiling): "I guess I got the answer I was looking for now. So what are you doing out here? Go back to his room and see how he's doing, okay?"  
美里（微笑）：“我想我现在得到了我一直在寻找的答案。那你在这里做什么呢？回他的房间去看看他怎么样了，好吗？”

Asuka stops in her tracks and looks back at her guardian, who smiles and winks knowingly at her. Asuka then smiles warmly and almost runs into Shinji's room, where she undresses as fast as she can, and joins Shinji back under the covers, where she cuddles up to him, as close as she can without waking him up. She lays still like that for five minutes, until she is asleep again, in the arms of the boy she loves.  
明日香停下脚步，回头望向她的守护者，对方微笑着向她眨了眨眼，意味深长。明日香随即露出温暖的笑容，几乎是跑进了真嗣的房间，她迅速脱下衣物，回到被窝里，紧挨着真嗣躺下，尽可能靠近他而不惊醒他。她就这样静静地躺了五分钟，直到再次在心爱男孩的怀抱中沉沉睡去。
