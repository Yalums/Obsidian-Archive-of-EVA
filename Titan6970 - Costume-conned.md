Shinji unexpectedly runs into Asuka at a comic-con, who 'fails' to recognize him cause of his costume.  
真嗣意外地在动漫展上遇到了明日香，她因为他的装扮而'没认出'他。

"Okay shinji, I'll take my leave then, gotta hurry before I piss off class rep,you know how she gets when I'm late to dates lol.", Toji said, excitedly, while giving Shinji a brofist."Ah well, see ya later dude, say hi to Hikari for me.", Shinji awkwardly replied. He wasn't used to Toji and Hikari dating."Lets hang out here again sometime, your Megumi Fushigoro cosplay's too good to be only worn once at the comic-con.", He continued. "Look who's talking! Dude your PS4 Spider-Man advanced suit's on a whole 'nother level. Don't even try to deny it!", Toji yelled as he ran towards the entry/exit point.  
"好的，真嗣，那我就先走了，得赶紧不然又要惹班长生气了，你知道她约会时我迟到会是什么样子的，哈哈。" 冬二兴奋地说着，同时给了真嗣一个兄弟拳。"嗯，那回头见，老兄，帮我向光问好。" 真嗣尴尬地回应。他还不习惯冬二和光交往的事。"改天我们再一起在这儿玩吧，你的虎杖悠仁 cosplay 太棒了，不能只在漫展上穿一次。" 他接着说。"你还说呢！哥们，你那 PS4 上的蜘蛛侠高级战衣简直不是一个级别的。别想否认！" 冬二边喊边朝入口/出口处跑去。

"Seems like I'll just hang around here for another half hour.", Shinji mumbled to himself, slightly chuckling at the unintended pun." Sucks that Kensuke and Toji had to leave early. This customized Spider-Man cosplay from a plugsuit was a genius idea, especially the expressive mask. Quite a bunch of people complimented me, including 3 gals." Shinji proudly thought, while mildly blushing. "Wonder how Asuka's gonna react to it when I reach home, probably going to call me immature and my idea as unoriginal bruh."  
"“看来我得在这里再晃悠半小时了。” 真嗣自言自语道，无意间的双关让他轻笑出声。“可惜健介和东治提前走了。这套从插入栓服改造的蜘蛛侠 cos 装真是天才的想法，尤其是那表情丰富的面具。不少人夸我呢，包括三位女生。” 真嗣得意地想着，脸上微微泛红。“不知道回家后明日香会有什么反应，大概会说我幼稚，想法老套吧。”

Ironically, as soon as he thought of her, He saw the familiar redhead at an Ice-cream stall, eating a strawberry cone."Ah crap, think of the red devil aaaannnnddd she appears. Atleast I'm wearing a mask, so she won't recognize me. I'll just roam around, maybe here and there see what she does, would be hilarious to tease her later. She looks hot in that Misty cosplay though." Shinji blushed at that last thought, trying to force some other perverted thoughts out of his mind.  
"讽刺的是，他刚想到她，就看见那个熟悉的红发女孩在冰淇淋摊前，吃着草莓甜筒。“我去，刚想红发魔女她就出现了。还好我戴着面具，她认不出我来。我就四处逛逛，看看她干嘛，待会儿逗她肯定很有趣。不过她那 Misty 的 cos 装确实很火辣。” 真嗣想到这里脸红了，努力把那些下流念头赶出脑海。”

"Wait you don't have change, gott I already used up all of mine! Seems like I'll have to ask someone to give me change for this 1000 yen note", She sighed. "I'll handle it Asuka!" Shinji accidentally blurted out, without thinking twice."Shit,oh shit!", he cursed to himself, quickly paying the stall's owner the price listed on the menu and about to head away when he felt a hand on his shoulder. "Usually, the superhero proceeds to flirt a little after saving the beautiful damsel in distress. Even if you're too stunned by my beauty to even speak, atleast take your money back. Also, how did you know who I was, cause if you're stalking me you're gonna get imprisoned for a long, long time!," The red haired German spoke, in a rather intimidating manner, her hands at her side while she eyed the guy in the Spider-Man suit suspiciously, only increasing Shinji's panic."Nnn-NO! I'm not a ss..stalker, just a friendly neighbourhood schoolmate. Since I go to the same school Miss Soryu, I know about you being the best eva pilot, a true hero while me and the others here can only pretend to be. Paying for your ice-cream was just my thanks to you, for protecting humanity and stuff." Shinji replied, with the panic clearly audible in his voice.  
"等等，你没有零钱吗？天啊，我的已经用完了！看来我得找人换开这张一千日元的钞票了。" 她叹了口气。"我来处理吧，绫波！" 真嗣不假思索地脱口而出。"该死，真该死！" 他暗自咒骂，迅速付给摊主菜单上的价格，正要离开时感到肩膀被一只手按住。"通常，超级英雄在救了美丽的受困女士后会稍作调情。即使你被我的美貌惊得说不出话，至少把你的钱拿回去。还有，你怎么知道我是谁的？如果你在跟踪我，那你可要坐很久很久的牢了！" 红发的德国女孩以相当威严的语气说道，双手叉腰，怀疑地盯着身穿蜘蛛侠服装的家伙，这让真嗣更加慌张。"不不不！我不是跟踪狂，只是个友好的同校同学。既然我和绫波小姐就读同一所学校，我知道你是最好的 EVA 驾驶员，真正的英雄，而我与其他人只能假装。替你付冰淇淋钱只是我对你的感谢，为了保护人类之类的事。"“绫波……” 真嗣回答道，声音中的恐慌清晰可闻。

Asuka's expression changed to a smirk. "The best eva pilot accepts your thanks. You're rather smart for someone who sounds like a baka." She said cheerfully, in a slightly teasing manner. "Crap! She called me a baka! Does she know its me?" he wondered. "So, what's your name, o Mr friendly neighbourhood schoolmate?" She asked. "Uh, oh right! I'm Kent Nanami, nice to meet you." Shinji replied, giving her a small wave with his right hand." "Since you're an admirer of mine and I'm getting bored as my friend left a few minutes ago for a date with her perverted boyfriend, I'll give you a chance to be a true hero and help defeat the villainous boredom, Spider-Man. In all seriousness, your costume's really good 'Kent', based on the new suit from the ps4 game right, one of my favourite Spider-Man costumes ever!",she spoke in an energetic and teasing manner. Shinji was unaware of the emphasis she put on Kent. "Also I allow you to call me Asuka, Miss Soryu's too formal, don't let it go to your head though, this isn't a date or anything! She added, trying to hide her blush by speaking in a loud tone, much to Shinji's annoyance.  
明日香的表情变成了一个得意的微笑。“最佳 EVA 驾驶员接受你的感谢。你听起来像个笨蛋，但还挺聪明的嘛。”她愉快地说道，带着一丝调侃的语气。“糟糕！她叫我笨蛋！她知道是我吗？”他暗自思忖。“那么，你叫什么名字，这位友好的邻校同学？”她问道。“呃，对了！我是 Kent Nanami，很高兴见到你。”真嗣回答，用右手向她轻轻挥了挥。“既然你是我的粉丝，而我朋友几分钟前去和她那变态男友约会了，我正无聊呢，我就给你一个机会成为真正的英雄，帮我打败邪恶的无聊，蜘蛛侠。说真的，你的服装真的很棒，‘Kent’，是根据 PS4 游戏里的新战衣做的吧，那可是我最喜欢的蜘蛛侠战衣之一！”她兴奋而调侃地说道。真嗣没有注意到她在“Kent”上加重了语气。“还有，我允许你叫我明日香，Soryu 小姐太正式了，不过别多想，这可不是什么约会！”她补充道，试图通过大声说话来掩饰自己的脸红，这让真嗣感到有些恼火。

"Okay Asuka, I'll be a gentlemanly superhero and assist you to vanquish this villainous boredom then." Shinji spoke, successfully adding some confidence to his voice. "Well this isn't a bad way to spend some time here, its pretty much a date and Asuka doesn't even know its me, so I won't get in trouble if it ends up sucking. Besides this might work out pretty well for me, though that's unlikely. I would love to be in a relationship with her, we have both been through some tough times recently and I've liked her for quite a while now, this might be the opening I've yearned for so long." He thought.  
"好的，明日香，我会做个绅士般的超级英雄，帮你打败这股邪恶的无聊。" 真嗣说道，成功地让自己的声音多了几分自信。"嗯，在这里这样打发时间也不赖，几乎像是一场约会，而明日香甚至不知道是我，所以即便最后不尽如人意，我也不会惹上麻烦。再说了，这或许对我大有裨益，尽管可能性不大。我一直希望能与她建立关系，我们最近都经历了些艰难时刻，而我喜欢她已久，这可能是我长久以来渴望的契机。" 他暗自思忖。

"Ok then, baka spider, lets head for some karaoke!" Asuka said gleefully, holding his hand and rushing towards the karaoke area set up, almost leading to Shinji tripping and getting dragged. After 30 minutes of karaoke, they decided to play some carnival games. "When it comes to singing, you aren't half bad webhead", she exclaimed. "But you are!" he replied quickly, to which the redhead mock pouted. "Whatever baka! Let me see you struggle at darts now, since there isn't any way that you won't fail to defeat me!", she quickly grabbed a dart from the shelf of the nearby darts stall and pretended to poke Shinji in the eye, making him jump back feeling startled, then proceeded to aim and hit the bullseye of the dartboard, followed by 2 darts in the 3rd ring. Shinji however, sucked at darts, one of his shots were just at the edge of the board, the other in the prizes at the side, causing the owner to curse profusely at him cause it almost hit him, and one dart in the 4th ring. "HA! even your pathetic spider sense is useless against the might of the great Asuka Langley Soryu" she said, while giving the back of Shinji's head a light smack. "I'm feeling hungry now, lets have something to eat shall we, Kent? Swing me away to a nice food stall! or to my baka roommate who's food is delicious, even though I haven't told him how much I like him-as a cook I mean!" Asuka was furiously blushing now, while Shinji was under shock behind his mask.  
"好吧，笨蛋蜘蛛，我们去唱卡拉 OK 吧！" 明日香兴高采烈地说道，拉着他的手冲向卡拉 OK 区，差点让真嗣绊倒被拖着走。唱了 30 分钟的卡拉 OK 后，他们决定去玩一些嘉年华游戏。"说到唱歌，你还不赖嘛，蜘蛛侠。" 她喊道。"但你可差远了！" 他迅速回嘴，让红发女孩假装撅嘴。"随便你怎么说！让我看看你在飞镖上的窘态，反正你不可能赢我！" 她迅速从附近的飞镖摊上抓起一支飞镖，假装要戳真嗣的眼睛，吓得他后退，然后瞄准并击中了飞镖盘的靶心，接着又有两支飞镖射中了第三环。然而，真嗣的飞镖技术很糟糕，一镖几乎贴着盘边，另一镖飞到了旁边的奖品上，差点打到摊主，让他破口大骂，还有一镖射在了第四环。"哈！连你那可怜的蜘蛛感应都敌不过伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的威力。" 她说着，轻轻拍了一下真嗣的后脑勺。 我现在肚子饿了，我们去吃点东西吧，肯特？带我去个好吃的摊位！或者去找我那笨蛋室友，他的手艺可真棒，虽然我还没告诉他我有多喜欢他的厨艺！” 明日香此刻脸红得厉害，而真嗣在面具后震惊不已。

They ordered a pizza on Shinji's suggestion, who excitedly said 'Pizza time' to a dumbfounded waiter and got a good chuckle out of Asuka. 'So, I've actually met your roommate before, he sometimes wanders around at the hills, something I like to do as well when I'm annoyed by stuff, he told me a few things about himself, how his dad abandoned him after his mom died in an experiment, makes sense why he's been so introverted and underconfident, most people would be after going through the hell that his childhood was.' Asuka stopped eating for a second, and gave a slow nod."He's much more courageous than he gives himself credit for, much stronger than he believes he is, and even after everything's that happened, he still acted kind towards everyone, risked his life without any training to help injured wondergirl and humanity, and saved my life on a number of occasions. He's easily the strongest person I know. I used to believe acting superior to others and suppressing emotions that made me look 'weak' was the right thing, but meeting him changed me. Even though it might be too late, I hope he forgives me for treating him like shit, because I knew he was better than I ever will be ." Asuka said in a sad tone, with some tears in her eyes."It was stupid of me to believe that if I'm not the best, I'm useless and that only piloting the eva was my life, when there was so much more in it, so much to do with Misato, with Shinji."  
他们根据真嗣的建议点了披萨，他兴奋地对一脸懵逼的服务员说了声“披萨时间”，逗得明日香哈哈大笑。“其实，我之前见过你的室友，他有时会在山丘上闲逛，我心情烦躁时也喜欢去那儿。他跟我聊过一些自己的事，比如他妈妈在实验中去世后，他爸爸就抛弃了他。难怪他一直那么内向和缺乏自信，经历过那样的童年，大多数人都会如此。”明日香停顿了一下，缓缓点头。“他比自己认为的要勇敢得多，比他自以为的要坚强得多，即便经历了那么多，他依然对每个人都那么友善，未经训练就冒着生命危险去帮助受伤的绫波和人类，还多次救了我的命。他是我认识的最坚强的人。我曾以为表现得比别人优越、压抑那些让我显得‘软弱’的情感是正确的，但遇见他改变了我。尽管可能为时已晚，我希望他能原谅我过去那样对待他，因为我知道他比我优秀得多。”明日香带着悲伤的语气说道，眼中泛着泪光。“我真傻，以为如果不是最好的，我就是无用的，以为驾驶 EVA 就是我生活的全部，却忽略了生活中还有那么多与美里、与真嗣共度的美好时光。”"

"He doesn't hate you, on the contrary, he's inspired by you, by your courage to pilot the eva, to defeat the angels even if it costs you your life. you being there inspired him to become stronger, you motivated him to get stronger because he cares for you and wishes to protect and help you in anyway he can. he finds both your looks and personality beautiful, and he loves you.", Shinji blurted all his feelings out, without thinking anything through. "seems like this is it, she's gonna kill me today, I had a trash life but it wasn't all bad lol"  
“他并不恨你，恰恰相反，他因你而受到鼓舞，你的勇气，你驾驶 EVA、不惜一切代价击败使徒的决心。你的存在激励他变得更强，你激发了他变得更强的动力，因为他关心你，希望以任何可能的方式保护和帮助你。他觉得你的外貌和性格都很美，他爱你。”真嗣一股脑儿地倾吐出所有情感，没有经过任何思考。“看来今天就是了，她会杀了我，虽然我的人生一团糟，但也不全是糟糕的，哈哈。”

Asuka hesitated for a moment, then said "I know he won't abandon me, and I won't abandon him too. I care about him much more than he thinks I do. I lll...love him too! I love you too Shinji!"  
明日香犹豫了一瞬，随即说道：“我知道他不会抛弃我，我也不会抛弃他。我关心他的程度远超他的想象。我……我也爱他！我也爱你，真嗣！”

Before Shinji could react, Asuka pulled his mask completely off, got up from her chair and kissed him passionately. Shinji's mind stopped working as he focused on returning the kiss and feeling it. After a few minutes of the ecstasy of kissing each other, with Shinji holding her back and Asuka's hands on his neck and the back of his head, they both reluctantly pulled away. "So you knew it was me, god why am I not surprised." Shinji tried to sound annoyed, though the blushes on their tomato-red faces "Of course I knew it was you baka, you really think I won't recognize a plugsuit even if its customized, not only that, you aren't good at changing your voice, even with the slight muffling due to the mask it was clear as day that Shinji Ikari was the man behind the mask. If I hadn't known who it was, I would've asked you to remove your mask first wouldn't I!", Asuka ranted. "Well then that was dumb of me to assume I could hide from you,I really am a baka" "You're my baka" Asuka quickly corrected him before kissing him again as the fireworks show started in the sky filling it with flames of red and purple, as Toji and Hikari looked at their friends heading to the ferris wheel after the kiss. "Looks like the scenario ended up positive and the accepted that they crushed on each other, instead of the negative Shinji dies case eh." Hikari gave a smiling nod before kissing Toji. Shinji and Asuka kissed again at the top of the ferris wheel, with a camera near the seat railing capturing their kiss, with the fireworks signifying their unending love for each other.  
在真嗣反应过来之前，明日香彻底摘掉了他的面具，从椅子上站起来，热情地吻了他。真嗣的思绪停滞了，他专注于回吻并感受这一吻。几分钟后，两人在亲吻的狂喜中，真嗣搂着她的背，明日香的手搭在他的脖颈和后脑，他们才依依不舍地分开。“所以你早就知道是我了，天啊，我怎么一点也不惊讶。”真嗣试图显得恼怒，尽管他们脸上泛起的番茄红晕已经说明了一切。“当然知道是你，笨蛋，你真以为我认不出驾驶服吗，就算它被定制过，不仅如此，你变声也不在行，即使有面具轻微的阻隔，你的声音也清晰如白昼。如果我不知道是你，我早就让你先摘下面具了，不是吗！”明日香滔滔不绝地说道。 "“好吧，我以为能躲开你真是太傻了，我真是个笨蛋。” “你是我的笨蛋。” 明日香迅速纠正他，然后再次吻了他，此时天空中烟花表演开始，绽放出红色和紫色的火焰，东治和光看着他们的朋友在接吻后走向摩天轮。“看来情景最终是积极的，他们接受了彼此的喜欢，而不是消极的‘真嗣死去’的情况，对吧。” 光微笑着点头，然后吻了东治。真嗣和明日香在摩天轮的顶端再次接吻，附近的座位栏杆旁有一台相机捕捉到了他们的吻，烟花象征着他们永恒的爱。”

[Romulo Nidoking BR](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/109777/Romulo-Nidoking-BR): Hey man.It was a sweet story that played well with the cosplay idea and, mostly, with the "secret identity" making them able to speak with each other more honestly.However, it deserves a revision in terms of formatting (more spacing and paragraphs to avoid wall of texts) and also in some dialogues, since I've noticed that in some occasions you've misplaced the dialogue tag (") for the inner thought tag (') and that disrupted the flow of things.Other than that, it was a good debut fic. Thanks for writing that.
这是个温馨的故事，与 cosplay 创意配合得很好，更重要的是，“秘密身份 ”使他们能够互相交谈、 的 “秘密身份”，让他们能够更坦诚地交流 不过，它在格式方面值得修改（更多的间距和段落，以避免出现 “文字墙”），在一些对话方面也值得修改。段落，以避免文字墙），还有一些对话，因为 我注意到，在某些情况下，你把对话标签（“”）错放到了内心想法标签（“”）上。(“”)错置为内心想法标签（''），这扰乱了文章的流畅性。谢谢你的写作。

[SuperSandwichGoku](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14807445/SuperSandwichGoku): This was a nice short fic, never really seen anything like them going to a comic-con together so thanks for writing this. Know it's been said before but I think you just need to fix some formatting and grammar issues, sometimes it was hard to follow who was speaking.Again, thanks for writing though.
这是一篇很不错的短篇小说，从来没见过像他们一起去漫画展这样的事情，所以感谢你写了这篇文章。我知道以前有人说过，但我觉得你只需要修正一些格式和语法问题，有时很难跟上谁在说话。
