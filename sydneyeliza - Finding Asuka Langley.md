### Chapter 1: Asuka Arrives  

Disclaimer: Don't own Evangelion, just love it, especially Misato and Asuka.  
声明：本人并不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，只是深爱着它，尤其是对美里和明日香情有独钟。

Author's Note: First eva fic I've tried to write, and it's probably very confusing. I haven't really set a time period for this, but I guess I'm assuming End of Eva never occurred? There aren't too many spoilers in this first chapter, but I'm sure there will be more later.  
作者注：这是我尝试撰写的第一篇《新世纪福音战士》同人作品，可能相当令人困惑。我并未明确设定时间背景，但似乎默认了《终章》未曾发生？本章节中没有太多剧透，但后续章节肯定会有更多。

_I don't remember. 我不记得了。_

"She's young. I'm guessing around twenty-five, twenty-six."  
"她很年轻。我猜大概二十五、二十六岁。"

A pause. A slight pressure on her head.  
停顿了一下。她的头感到一丝轻微的压力。

"Look at the color of that hair. She must have been a great beauty at some point."  
"看那头发的颜色。她一定曾经是个大美人。"

A cold breeze. Unfamiliar voices.  
一阵寒风。陌生的声音。

"Do we know her name?"  
“我们认识她吗？”

Her name. The three words she used to flaunt so flirtingly all the time.  
她的名字。那三个她曾一直轻佻地挂在嘴边的字。

"No."

She was nameless. A nonentity wandering this earth.  
她无名无姓，不过是这世间游荡的一介无名之辈。

A sigh. "We'll wait for her to wake up. Perhaps then she'll be able to tell us more about herself."  
一声叹息。“我们等她醒来吧。或许那时她能告诉我们更多关于她自己的事。”

"Yes, that would be for the best."  
“是的，那样最好不过。”

A closing door followed by another cold draft. She could feel her hair blowing softly across her face, but she couldn't move her fingers. She cannot open her eyes to see where she is.  
一扇门关闭后，又是一阵寒风。她能感觉到自己的头发轻轻拂过脸颊，但她的手指却动弹不得。她无法睁开眼睛看看自己身处何地。

Who am I? 我是谁？

= = = = = = =

There was a soft beep as the monitor lines turned green and the clear plastic covering slid off of the patient as if by magic. The girl lying inside slowly opened her eyes.  
随着监视器上的线条转为绿色，覆盖在病人身上的透明塑料罩仿佛被魔法移开，躺在里面的女孩缓缓睁开了眼睛。

A blank patternless ceiling.  
一片空白的无图案天花板。

"Oh, you're awake!" The well-meaning nurse hurried over to her side. "How are you feeling?"  
“哦，你醒了！”好心的护士急忙走到她身边。“你感觉怎么样？”

She tried to speak. No words came from her lips, only a ragged rasp of a sound.  
她试图说话。嘴唇间没有话语流出，只有一声沙哑的喘息。

The nurse looked concerned. "Do you want some water?"  
护士看起来很担心。“你想喝点水吗？”

She nodded faintly. The nurse smiled, patted her hand, and hurried away.  
她微微点头。护士微笑着，轻拍她的手，匆匆离开了。

Who am I? 我是谁？

The question came back to haunt her as she searched the depths of her mind for answers. Surprisingly, the girl who had always told herself that there was no need for others, that she could thrive alone, vaguely remembered the names of others—but not her own.  
这个问题再次困扰着她，她在内心深处寻找答案。令人惊讶的是，那个总是告诉自己不需要别人，可以独自茁壮成长的女孩，隐约记得其他人的名字——却记不起自己的。

Misato. Major Katsuragi Misato. A young woman with strikingly dark purple hair.  
碇。葛城美里少校。一位拥有深紫色头发的年轻女性。

Ritsuko. The blonde. She could no longer remember her surname, except that it began with an A sound.  
律子。那个金发女子。她已经记不清她的姓氏了，只记得是以 A 音开头的。

Rei? The silent one. The one whose name meant "zero". The one she had hated so much, although now she couldn't remember why.  
绫波？那个沉默寡言的人。那个名字意味着“零”的人。那个她曾经如此憎恨的人，尽管现在她已经记不清原因了。

Shinji. 真嗣。

One word was synonymous with that name in her mind. Baka.  
在她心中，那个名字与一个词同义。笨蛋。

She closed her eyes and scrunched them up, racking her brains. Why could she remember all these names, or fragments of names, but not her own? There were three distinct words—that she knew—but nothing else.  
她闭上眼睛，皱紧眉头，绞尽脑汁。为什么她能记得所有这些名字，或是名字的片段，却唯独记不起自己的？她知道有三个清晰的字——但除此之外，一无所知。

She propped herself up on her elbows and looked around, inspecting all the technologically advanced machines, then came back to her own body. Her feet were grimy and the soles were rough. She wiggled her toes. Her long copper hair, once long and shiny, was now dull and felt like a weight on her shoulders.  
她用手肘撑起身子，环顾四周，仔细打量着那些高科技机器，随后目光回到自己的身体上。她的双脚满是污垢，脚底粗糙。她动了动脚趾。曾经长而亮泽的铜色长发，如今变得暗淡无光，沉重地压在肩上。

There was something hard under her, digging into her flesh. She reached under and pulled it out.  
她身下有什么硬物，硌得她生疼。她伸手探进去，将其拽了出来。

A plastic card, splattered with large red X's that covered the face and name of a teenage girl.  
一张塑料卡片，上面布满了大大的红色叉号，遮盖住了一个少女的脸庞和名字。

Who is she? 她是谁？

The door slid open abruptly and the nurse stepped back in, efficiently holding up a tall glass of water and closing the door with her foot. "Here you go."  
门突然滑开，护士退后一步，麻利地举起一大杯水，用脚关上门。'给你。'

The girl hesitated, then lifted it slowly to her lips. The cool liquid was like honey nectar to her dry, rasping throat. She drank her fill, then wiped at her lips with her free hand.  
女孩犹豫了一下，然后缓缓将它举至唇边。那清凉的液体对她干涩刺痛的喉咙来说，犹如甘露。她畅饮一番后，用空着的手擦了擦嘴唇。

The nurse pulled up a chair and sat down beside her. "Would you like to tell me your name?"  
护士拉过一把椅子，坐在她旁边。“你想告诉我你的名字吗？”

She shook her head. She could not be sure of her voice yet. The nurse averted her gaze, clearly disappointed, and it landed on the card in her pale white hands.  
她摇了摇头，还不能确定自己的声音是否稳定。护士显然失望地移开了目光，转而注视着她苍白双手中的卡片。

"It's a picture of you."  
"这是一张你的照片。"

She tried hard to comprehend the words. A picture of her? This was what she looked like?  
她努力去理解这些话。一张她的照片？这就是她的样子吗？

No, this girl was alive. She felt very dead and hollow inside.  
不，这个女孩是活生生的。而她自己感觉非常死寂和空洞。

"May I see it?" "我可以看看吗？"

Her fingers tightened on the card. Nevertheless, without much effort the nurse freed it from her hands and squinted as she rotated it back and forth, inspecting every aspect.  
她的手指紧紧捏着卡片。然而，护士没费多大力气就从她手中抽出卡片，眯起眼睛，来回转动着仔细检查每一个细节。

"Nerv, UN...Sorhyu Asuka Langley. 0001-257-33."  
"NERV, 联合国...惣流·明日香·兰格雷。0001-257-33。"

Sorhyu Asuka Langley. 惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

That's my name. 那是我的名字。

= = = = = = =

Several days passed before Asuka could speak again, and she did so then only in utter privacy. Her voice was quiet and weak at first, as she repeated the names of the objects around her, afraid to unlock the secrets of her mind and heart. She knew that if she revealed her vocal secret to the nurse, they would be interrogating her endlessly about her past. After all, she had no idea how she had turned up here and had only an ID card with a past picture of her and a few memories of some fragmented names.  
几天过去，明日香才再次开口，且仅在绝对私密的环境中。起初，她的声音微弱而低沉，重复着周围物品的名字，害怕揭开心灵深处的秘密。她明白，一旦向护士透露自己能说话的秘密，他们定会无休止地追问她的过去。毕竟，她对自己如何来到这里一无所知，身边仅有一张带有过去照片的身份证和几个零碎名字的记忆片段。

Ever since she had regained consciousness, the nurse had taken a great liking to her and gone to extremes to make her happy. In one way Asuka was happy for her company, but in another way, her incessant chatting had quickly become old. She'd learned plenty about the woman's daughters, sisters, brothers, aunts, and other relatives. She had heard so much about her house that she could probably draw a detailed diagram of it, providing she could control her mind and fingers.  
自从她恢复意识以来，那位护士就对她产生了极大的好感，并极尽所能地让她开心。一方面，明日香很高兴有她陪伴，但另一方面，她那没完没了的聊天很快就让人感到厌烦。她已经了解了很多关于这位女士的女儿、姐妹、兄弟、姑姨以及其他亲戚的事情。她听了太多关于她家的事情，以至于如果她能控制自己的思维和手指，她可能都能画出一张详细的家宅图。

She was fine physically. Asuka knew that. It was her mind that she was concerned about.  
她身体无恙，明日香对此心知肚明。她所担忧的，是她的心智。

She was alone in her room now, the fifth morning since she had awakened from her coma. The names of the machines and furniture around her had quickly become old, and slowly, bit by bit, she began to tear at the cement wall she had constructed around the people of her past.  
此刻，她独自一人在房间里，这是她从昏迷中醒来后的第五个早晨。周围机器和家具的名字很快就变得熟悉，慢慢地，一点一点地，她开始撕扯着她为过去的人们所筑起的水泥墙。

The one she remembered the most was the one she'd dubbed "baka" without really knowing why. What he had done in the past to make her call him that, she didn't know. Gradually, however, she was beginning to remember how he looked. He had been a tall, skinny boy with a long neck and distinctly feminine eyes. His hair had been dark brown and had often stuck at odd angles. In her mind he always wore the same expression—a shy, terrified look.  
她记得最清楚的是那个她无端称之为“笨蛋”的人。他过去做了什么让她这样称呼他，她并不清楚。然而，渐渐地，她开始记起他的模样。他曾是一个高瘦的男孩，脖子修长，眼睛明显带有女性的柔美。他的头发是深棕色的，常常以奇怪的角度翘起。在她的记忆中，他总是带着一种羞涩而惊恐的表情。

Asuka was sleeping regular hours now, and he was appearing in her dreams, as well. With the exception of the lack of dialogue, her dreams might have constituted the past. Shinji-baka was always standing in a vaguely kitchen, his head hanging low. Asuka wanted to yell at him, to reprimand him although she didn't know what he'd done, but she couldn't speak. She had no voice.  
如今，明日香已能规律作息，而他也会出现在她的梦中。除了缺少对话，这些梦境或许就是过往的再现。那个笨蛋真嗣总是站在一个模糊的厨房里，头低垂着。明日香想要对他大喊，尽管不知道他犯了什么错，却想要斥责他，但她发不出声音，失去了言语的能力。

But before she could find out who he, Misato Katsuragi, Ritsuko, or the mysterious Rei was, she'd have to find out who she herself was.  
但在她弄清楚他是谁，以及葛城美里、律子或神秘的绫波丽是谁之前，她首先得弄清楚自己是谁。

The problem was that all she had was an ID card of a person she didn't recognize anymore.  
问题在于，她手中仅有的身份证件属于一个她已无法辨认的人。

### Chapter 2: First Steps  
第二章：初试啼声  

"Asuka-chan." "明日香酱。"

It was amazing just how accustomed the nurse had become to calling her Asuka, almost as if it was a pet name.  
令人惊讶的是，护士已经习惯了称呼她为明日香，几乎像是一个昵称。

Obligingly Asuka swung her legs over the side of the bed and shivered as her toes made contact with the cold floor. She was still barefoot and the chilliness traveled from her feet up throughout her body. The redhead folded her arms around herself. Why was it so cold in this damn place?  
明日香顺从地从床边晃动双腿，当她的脚趾触碰到冰冷的地板时，不禁打了个寒颤。她仍然赤着脚，寒意从脚底蔓延至全身。红发女孩双臂环抱自己。为什么这个地方这么冷？

As usual, the nurse offered her arm and Asuka took it. In these few days she had learned much. She had learned that her nurse's name was Hazuki-san, was thirty-two, and had spent five of those years in this hospital. She had learned that this was one of the best hospitals in Japan, where many of the specialists worked. She had learned that there was a restroom to the left of her room and a small cafeteria down the hallway.  
一如既往，护士伸出手臂，明日香握住了它。这几天里，她学到了很多。她知道她的护士名叫 Hazuki-san，三十二岁，在这家医院工作了五年。她了解到这是日本最好的医院之一，许多专家都在这里工作。她还知道她的房间左边有一个洗手间，走廊尽头有一间小咖啡厅。

But Asuka had discovered nothing about herself, and that frustrated her immensely.  
但明日香对自己一无所知，这让她感到极度沮丧。

She thought back to the image on the ID card. A winking younger girl holding up two fingers in a "V" symbol, a wide smile on her face.  
她回想起身份证上的照片。一个眨眼的年轻女孩举起两根手指做出“V”字形，脸上洋溢着灿烂的笑容。

Her name is Sorhyu Asuka Langley.  
她的名字是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

My name is Sorhyu Asuka Langley.  
我的名字是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

But are we the same person?  
但我们是否是同一个人呢？

In recent days, Hazuki-san had brushed out her long hair and tied it back with a thick pink ribbon. She'd futilely tried for the look in the teenage photo and finally settled on a simple ponytail, with the copper cascade fastened low on the back of Asuka's neck.  
近日，小月小姐将她的长发梳顺，用一条厚厚的粉色丝带扎在脑后。她徒劳地试图模仿那张青少年时期的照片中的造型，最终还是选择了简单的马尾，铜色的发瀑低低地束在明日香的后颈。

In addition, she'd brought Asuka a clean hospital gown daily but didn't insist on throwing away the rags the redhead had worn when she showed up at the hospital—how she had done so was still a mystery. Surprisingly Asuka didn't mind; the new gown was large, spacey, and smelled clean and fresh. It was a nice change from the soiled blue-green dress she had been wearing. Hazuki-san had even taken it home and washed it and mended all the rips. Asuka was quite grateful to her for that, if she could feel gratitude in her state of confusion.  
此外，她每天都会给明日香带来一件干净的病号服，但并未坚持要扔掉红发女孩刚到医院时穿的那身破烂——她是如何做到的仍是个谜。令人惊讶的是，明日香对此并不介意；新的病号服宽松舒适，散发着清新洁净的气息。与她之前那件脏兮兮的蓝绿色连衣裙相比，这无疑是个令人愉悦的改变。小月小姐甚至把它带回家清洗并缝补了所有的裂口。明日香对此颇为感激，尽管在她那混乱的状态中，感激之情或许难以言表。

How old am I? 我多大了？

Another question had crept into her mind. Hazuki-san had told her that she appeared about twenty-five or twenty-six, although no medical records on any Sorhyu Asuka Langleys could be found.  
另一个问题悄然爬上她的心头。Hazuki-san 曾告诉她，她看起来大约二十五或二十六岁，尽管任何关于 Sorhyu Asuka Langley 的医疗记录都无处可寻。

"You look very nice." Hazuki-san smiled, obviously proud of the young lady on her arm. "Ready to turn back now?"  
“你看起来非常漂亮。”Hazuki-san 微笑着，显然对自己臂弯中的年轻女士感到自豪。“准备好回去了吗？”

Asuka shook her head. Asuka 摇了摇头。

She wanted to explore. She wanted to let go of Hazuki-san's hand and walk on her own to the open window nearby from which sunlight streamed in. Asuka could hear the sound of the cars and birds outside.  
她渴望探索。她想要放开小林先生的手，独自走向那扇阳光洒入的窗户，听着窗外汽车和鸟儿的鸣叫声。

She loosened her grip on her nurse's arm and took her first wobbling steps alone, feeling foolish and frustrated.  
她松开了护士的手臂，独自迈出了颤巍巍的第一步，感到既愚蠢又沮丧。

If I can't remember how to do something as easy as walking, how will I find out who I am?  
如果连走路这么简单的事都记不起来，我又该如何找回自己是谁呢？

Asuka stumbled and tripped to the floor. Hazuki-san ran to her side, a sturdy arm ready, but Asuka ignored her and climbed back to her feet. The nurse backed away after seeing the determined look on her patient's face and remained a good distance away.  
明日香踉跄着摔倒在地。长月さん急忙跑向她，一只结实的手臂随时准备扶助，但明日香无视了她，挣扎着重新站了起来。看到病人脸上坚定的表情，护士退后了几步，保持在一个安全的距离。

It took her nearly ten minutes to cover the twenty feet ahead of her, but when Asuka got there she placed both hands on the windowsill and threw her head back, feeling her hair tickle her face as it was blown backwards. She didn't mind this kind of cold. Unknown to the redhead, Hazuki-san strategically placed herself off at an angle, so that she wouldn't be interfering, but would be close enough to help should anything occur.  
她花了将近十分钟才走完面前的二十英尺，但当明日香到达那里时，她双手撑在窗台上，仰起头，感受着被风吹向后方的头发轻拂脸颊。她并不介意这种寒冷。红发少女未曾察觉，长月さん巧妙地站在一旁，既不干扰，又能在需要时及时伸出援手。

Asuka breathed in the fresh sweet-smelling air, and wished that she would never have to return to that stuffy room she lived in, where everything smelled of antiseptics and various medical chemicals.  
明日香深吸了一口清新甜美的空气，希望自己永远不必回到那个闷热的房间，那里充斥着消毒剂和各种医疗化学品的气味。

She was still pretending to be mute. As much as she appreciated the efforts of her nurse, the well-meaning woman had begun practically bombarding her with questions. Since she couldn't reply vocally, Hazuki-san had brought her a pretty notebook with pale green pages bordered with pink cherry blossoms. Asuka had simply laid the book aside and turned her head away.  
她还在假装哑巴。尽管她很感激护士的努力，那位好心的女士已经开始不停地向她提问。由于她无法用声音回答，Hazuki-san 给她带来了一本漂亮的笔记本，淡绿色的页边饰有粉红色的樱花。明日香只是把书放在一边，转过头去。

I'm not willing to tell Hazuki-san what I know, although I've already begun to remember.  
我不愿意告诉 Hazuki-san 我所知道的事情，尽管我已经开始记起来了。

She remembered a little bit about the kitchen. Certainly Misato had been there many times, along with a penguin. Or had her mind simply invented that detail? Asuka shook her head to clear it. A penguin in a kitchen... surely she was going mad. There was a table in the middle, stacked high with cans of beer. She wondered how Hazuki-san would react if she told her about the penguin and beer.  
她记得厨房的一些片段。当然 Misato 去过那里很多次，还有一只企鹅。还是她的记忆只是虚构了这个细节？明日香摇摇头想清醒一下。厨房里的企鹅...她肯定疯了。中间有一张桌子，堆满了啤酒罐。她想知道如果她告诉 Hazuki-san 关于企鹅和啤酒的事，她会有什么反应。

She'd probably wind up in a mental institution.  
她大概最终会进精神病院。

Penguins and beer... so where did the Misato girl fit in?  
企鹅和啤酒……那么那个叫美里女孩又算什么呢？

Asuka was still working on that.  
明日香还在琢磨这个。

She remembered distinctly the purple hair, the large curls on either side of her forehead. She recalled Misato going to a wedding, wearing an expensive dress of nearly the same shade.  
她清晰地记得那紫色的头发，以及额头两侧的大卷发。她回想起美里去参加婚礼时，穿着一件几乎同色系的昂贵礼服。

Asuka placed one elbow on the windowsill and propped her chin up on her fist. The slightest tilting of her wrist allowed her to look down and see the busy street below.  
明日香将一只手肘撑在窗台上，用拳头托着下巴。她轻轻转动了一下手腕，就能俯视下面繁忙的街道。

How many cars there were.  
街上车水马龙。

How tall the buildings were.  
那些建筑有多高。

How stable they looked. As if they could be shifted ten stories up or down without toppling at all.  
它们看起来多么稳固。仿佛可以上下移动十层楼而丝毫不倒。

Asuka had a sudden vision of Tokyo-3 suddenly becoming an underground city...  
明日香突然想象到第三新东京市突然变成一座地下城市……

= = = = = =

"Asuka-chan!" “明日香酱！”

Asuka was angry at herself, pounding on her forehead with a fist now. She'd found no answers, but unearthed a series of new questions. She'd encountered the terrifying monsters that were called Angels. She had seen the huge red and purple structures. She'd heard their names. Eva.  
明日香对自己感到愤怒，此刻正用拳头敲打着额头。她没有找到答案，反而挖掘出一连串新的疑问。她遭遇了被称为使徒的恐怖怪物。她目睹了那些巨大的红紫色结构体。她听到了它们的名字。Eva。

A new word. A new mystery.  
一个新的词汇。一个新的谜团。

"Asuka-chan!" “明日香酱！”

Hazuki-san helped her back to her room and immediately put her to bed, at which time Asuka turned away and lay on her side, facing away from her nurse.  
Hazuki-san 扶她回到房间，立刻让她躺下，这时明日香转过身去，侧躺着背对她的护士。

She was unable to stop the sniffling, as much as she hated it.  
她无法停止抽泣，尽管她对此深恶痛绝。

Who am I? Why am I here?  
我是谁？我为何在此？

Do I have no family?  
难道我没有家人吗？

Why do I remember that monster, Eva?  
为何我会记得那个怪物，伊娃？

"Do you want some water?"  
"你要喝点水吗？"

Asuka closed her eyes tightly, trying to hold back the tears, blocking out Hazuki-san's voice. She had once been a strong-willed young woman, that she knew for sure. Probably someone who never gave any thought to anyone else before she spoke. One who cared only for herself.  
明日香紧紧闭上眼睛，努力忍住泪水，屏蔽了长月先生的声音。她曾经是一个意志坚强的年轻女性，这一点她确信无疑。可能是一个在说话前从不考虑他人感受的人。只关心自己的人。

So why am I not that person now?  
那为什么我现在不是那个人了呢？

I answer to Asuka. But I am not Sorhyu Asuka Langley anymore.  
我叫明日香。但不再是惣流·明日香·兰格雷了。

Hazuki-san stayed with her patient until the sobbing stopped and her shoulders moved up and down evenly in rhythm with her calmed breathing. As soon as she disappeared, Asuka flipped onto her back, then reached under her pillow and pulled out the tattered dress. One of the only two secrets to her identity.  
Hazuki-san 一直陪在她身边，直到她的哭泣停止，肩膀随着平静的呼吸有节奏地起伏。她一消失，明日香立刻翻过身来，伸手从枕头下拿出那件破旧的连衣裙。这是她身份仅有的两个秘密之一。

She smoothed it out on the bed and wondered where it had come from. She'd certainly never worn such a dress in her dreams.  
她把裙子在床上摊平，好奇它从何而来。她当然从未在梦中穿过这样的裙子。

No, there'd had been something else. Something large and red. Much bigger than a dress, or even a long winter overcoat.  
不，还有别的。某个巨大且红色的东西。比一件裙子，甚至是一件长长的冬大衣还要大得多。

Asuka's eyes widened in surprise.  
明日香惊讶地睁大了眼睛。

Eva?

### Chapter 3: A Visitor  
第三章：访客  

"I'm here to see Sorhyu Asuka Langley."  
“我来见惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”

The receptionist glanced up from whatever she had been writing and shifted her gaze to the woman in front of her. She held a small bouquet of unrecognizable flowers in one hand, the blossoms small and bunched together. Her facial expression immediately showed that she was not a woman to mess with.  
接待员从正在书写的文件中抬起头，目光转向面前的女子。她一手拿着一小束不知名的花朵，花儿小巧而密集。她的面部表情立刻显示出她不是个好惹的女人。

With one finger, the receptionist tapped the keyboard languidly. It took an agonizingly long time for her to pull up Asuka's files. The visitor remembered Ritsuko Akagi's technological talent.  
接待员用一根手指慵懒地敲打着键盘，花了令人痛苦的长久时间才调出明日香的档案。访客想起了赤木律子的科技才能。

"Sorhyu Asuka Langley is in Room 212. The elevators are to your right."  
“惣流·明日香·兰格雷在 212 号房间。电梯在您的右边。”

"Arigatoo." “谢谢。”

She bowed to a 45-degree angle, then pivoted and headed towards the elevators.  
她向着 45 度角鞠了一躬，随即转身朝电梯走去。

She was older now, of course, and she'd begun to find a few white hairs—the result of her worrying and sorrow over the last decade—but overall, she felt she hadn't changed much. She still walked the same way, her back held straight, her arms swinging from side to side—her hands balled into fists. Sometimes she would still have a cell phone to her ear and her words would still rush as a stream of commands, her voice never faltering when giving directions.  
当然，她现在年纪大了些，也开始发现了几根白发——这是过去十年忧虑和悲伤的痕迹——但总的来说，她觉得自己变化不大。她走路的姿势依旧，背挺得笔直，双臂左右摆动——双手紧握成拳。有时她还会把手机贴在耳边，话语依旧如命令般急促，发号施令时声音从不犹豫。

Her hand shook ever so slightly as she reached for the button labeled "up". She paused, then looked over her shoulder. The receptionist was watching her.  
她的手微微颤抖着伸向标有“上”的按钮。她停顿了一下，然后回头望去。前台正注视着她。

Misato Katsuragi pressed the button and stepped into the narrow elevator, a steely glint in her chocolate eyes.  
葛城美里按下按钮，踏入狭窄的电梯，巧克力色的眼眸中闪过一丝坚毅的光芒。

= = = = = = =

Asuka was in bed again.  
明日香又躺在床上了。

Of course, that wasn't too uncommon. She got up around 9 every day, went for her morning walk with Hazuki-san, came back to her room for breakfast, and had the rest of the day free to herself—save for mealtimes.  
当然，这并不罕见。她每天大约九点起床，和长月小姐一起去晨走，回来吃早餐，然后一整天都可以自由支配——除了用餐时间。

Much to her delight—and her nurse's—the I.V. line had been removed from her arm, and Asuka was beginning to try foods that had been denied to her before. A variety of fruits and vegetables stacked up in her room faster than she could eat them. She was propped up now by a stack of pillows, trying to peel an orange.  
令她欣喜的是——还有她的护士——静脉注射管已经从她的手臂上取下，明日香开始尝试之前被禁止的食物。各种水果和蔬菜在她房间里堆积得比她能吃的速度还快。现在她靠在一堆枕头上，试图剥一个橘子。

In addition to learning of her past, Asuka felt as if she had to relearn how to act human, and it frustrated her. She'd finally mastered the art of moving her legs evenly, walking without toppling over. It hadn't been too hard to learn how to use a knife and fork, but chopsticks were another matter. When Hazuki-san took her meals with her favorite patient, the redhead would sit and marvel as she deftly picked up food with two thin bamboo sticks.  
除了了解自己的过去，明日香感觉自己好像必须重新学习如何像人类一样行动，这让她感到沮丧。她终于掌握了双腿均匀移动的艺术，走路不再摇摇欲坠。学会使用刀叉并不太难，但筷子又是另一回事了。当 Hazuki-san 和她最喜欢的病人一起用餐时，红发女孩会坐在那里，惊叹于她如何熟练地用两根细竹棍夹起食物。

At the other end of the spectrum were foods such as oranges, which required no utensils to eat. When she had first found herself faced with a round, waxy orange fruit, Asuka had tried to bite through the thick peel. When that failed, she stabbed it ferociously with an fork—the result of which was that orange juice squirted out and got in her eye. Eventually Hazuki- san came by and removed the peel, but by then Asuka was utterly exasperated with herself and had enough. The orange remained uneaten.  
在食物的另一端，比如橙子，吃的时候不需要任何餐具。当她第一次面对一个圆润、蜡质的橙子时，明日香曾试图咬穿厚厚的果皮。失败后，她用叉子猛刺橙子——结果橙汁喷射出来，溅进了她的眼睛。最终，Hazuki-san 过来剥掉了果皮，但那时明日香已经对自己感到极度沮丧，再也吃不下去了。橙子就这样被留在了那里。

There were days when she had more patience, and today was one of them. She'd gone for her morning walk (without clinging to Hazuki-san's arm!) and even visited a few other patients. Her nurse had taken her down to the children's ward and let her watch them playing and recovering through the glass wall. One young girl, stumbling to walk, even made her way over to the wall and laughed as she pressed a tiny hand onto her side of the glass. To Hazuki's astonishment and delight, Asuka had responded by smiling and pressing her hand against that of the child.  
有些日子她的耐心更多，今天就是其中之一。她去散步了（没有抓着 Hazuki-san 的手臂！），甚至还探访了几位其他病人。她的护士带她去了儿童病房，让她透过玻璃墙观看孩子们玩耍和康复。一个小女孩蹒跚学步，甚至走到墙边，笑着将小手按在玻璃上。令 Hazuki 惊讶和高兴的是，明日香回应了，微笑着将手按在孩子的手上。

It was one of the tiny, nominal happy memories of her new life that Asuka treasured as diamonds in her mind. Ever since she had come to the hospital, she had had virtually no contact with anybody other than Hazuki-san, except for the gruff doctor who came in every few days to make sure that she was all right. It still astonished her that that little girl had actually been happy to see her—her, a lost, insignificant person who didn't even know who she was.  
这是她新生活中那些微小却珍贵的快乐记忆之一，在明日香心中如同钻石般珍藏。自从她来到医院，除了偶尔来检查她状况的粗鲁医生外，几乎没有任何人与她接触，除了长月小姐。那个小女孩见到她时竟然感到高兴，这仍然让她感到惊讶——她，一个迷失且微不足道的人，甚至不知道自己是谁。

Asuka didn't notice that she was smiling slightly as she remembered. She dug her nail into the peel and bent her thumb. With a soft ripping sound, loud in the silence of her room, the peel pulled away from the juicy orange flesh. Asuka stared, surprised. Then she laughed, a gurgle of excitement bubbling from her throat. She peeled the rest of it happily, in the same way, then divided the inside into twelve equal pieces as Hazuki-san had shown her. She held each piece up to the light, in turn, and marveled at the prettiness of the translucent orange fruit.  
明日香没有注意到自己回忆时微微露出的笑容。她用指甲抠进橘子皮，弯曲拇指。随着一声在房间寂静中显得格外响亮的轻柔撕裂声，橘子皮从多汁的果肉上剥离。明日香惊讶地盯着，然后笑了起来，兴奋的咕噜声从喉咙里冒出。她开心地用同样的方式剥完剩下的橘子皮，然后按照长月小姐教她的方法，将果肉分成十二等份。她依次将每一片举到光线下，惊叹于这透明橙色水果的美丽。

Misato watched dejectedly through the slits in the blinds of Asuka's window.  
美里沮丧地透过明日香窗户上的百叶窗缝隙窥视着。

So this was what the young, talented fiery pilot of Eva 02 had become.  
原来，这就是那位年轻、才华横溢、热情似火的 Eva 02 驾驶员如今的模样。

She resisted the urge to bang on the window, realizing that Asuka would probably go mad at someone disturbing her joy with the orange—and furthermore, she probably couldn't see her former commander through the blinds. Misato sighed. The flowers in her hand seemed to wilt with her dejection. She looked down at them and plucked off a petal absentmindedly, then let it flutter to the floor. It hadn't surprised her that the receptionist had looked at it so curiously—after all, they weren't the usual roses, lilies, or spring bouquets one might bring to cheer up a friend. Misato had plucked the starflowers from a patch in the woods and tried to arrange them among the watermelon flowers. There were a few wild daisies and something in her yard that looked suspiciously like a weed—but it was colorful and flowering, so Misato had added it. The result was a rather mismatching bundle of flowers, all in different lengths and sizes.  
她强忍住敲窗的冲动，意识到打扰了明日香享受橙子的乐趣，她可能会发疯——而且，透过百叶窗，她可能也看不到她曾经的指挥官。美里叹了口气。手中的花似乎随着她的沮丧而凋谢。她低头看着它们，心不在焉地摘下一片花瓣，然后让它飘落到地板上。接待员好奇地看着这些花，这并不让她感到惊讶——毕竟，它们不是通常用来安慰朋友的玫瑰、百合或春日花束。美里从树林里的一片花丛中摘下了星形花，试图将它们与西瓜花混在一起。还有几朵野生的雏菊和院子里看起来很像杂草的东西——但它们色彩鲜艳且正在开花，所以美里也把它们加进去了。结果是一束相当不协调的花束，长短大小各异。

The former Nerv commander turned her gaze back to her former charge. All the slices of oranges were gone and Asuka was on her feet in front of the platter of fruit. A few minutes later she crept back into bed with an armload of apples, oranges, and kiwifruits. Misato watched as she opened up another orange and began to eat.  
前 NERV 指挥官将目光转回她曾经的被监护人身上。所有的橙子片都已消失，明日香站在果盘前。几分钟后，她抱着一堆苹果、橙子和猕猴桃悄悄回到床上。美里看着她剥开另一个橙子，开始吃起来。

She wondered that they let her do that, day after day.  
她不禁疑惑，他们为何日复一日地允许她这样做。

Misato sighed again and wondered why Ritsuko hadn't told her of Asuka's condition, only that she was in Tokyo-3. Even after Nerv had split, she and Ritsuko had remained distantly in touch—an email or phone call now and then. Her college classmate was working as an engineer in Kyoto and seemed to regard her memories of the Nerv years coolly, though she was not overly sensitive—as Misato sometimes tended to feel—although she hid it. It was a skill she'd developed and refined over the years since the Second Impact.  
美里再次叹息，不明白为什么律子没有告诉她明日香的情况，只说她身在东京-3。即便 NERV 解散后，她和律子仍保持着疏远的联系——偶尔发封邮件或打个电话。她的大学同学在京都担任工程师，似乎对 NERV 时期的记忆持冷静态度，尽管她并不特别敏感——美里有时会这样感觉——尽管她隐藏得很好。这是她在第二次冲击后的这些年里培养和磨练出来的技能。

It hadn't really surprised Misato when Ritsuko called. She'd been expecting it; after all, over two months had passed since the blonde had last written. What shocked her was the unusual shortness of the call—and the jarring message Ritsuko had to deliver.  
当律子打电话来时，美里并没有感到意外。她早有预感；毕竟，距离金发女子上次来信已经过去了两个多月。让她震惊的是通话的异常简短——以及律子传达的那条令人心惊的消息。

Asuka's back. 明日香回来了。

Sorhyu Asuka Langley? The redhead who used to hit Shinji and call him "baka" all the time?  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷？那个总是打真嗣、叫他“笨蛋”的红发女孩？

Misato wouldn't believe it at first. Part of her didn't want to believe it. But Ritsuko, with her quiet words of truth and that uncanny understanding of her old friend, soon won her over.  
起初，美里不愿相信。她内心的一部分也不想相信。但律子用她那平静的真言和对她老友那不可思议的理解，很快就让她信服了。

Her young charges had split soon after Nerv disintegrated and the angel attacks stopped. Asuka had been the first to leave, declaring that she was off to "make a difference in the world"—as if she hadn't already—and that she was glad to be rid of "ano baka" and Misato. The door had slammed and she had gone. Misato had had too much on her mind to worry about her then.  
在 NERV 解体、使徒攻击停止后不久，她年轻的被监护人们就分道扬镳了。明日香是第一个离开的，她宣称要去“改变世界”——仿佛她还没做到似的——并且很高兴摆脱了“那个笨蛋”和美里。门砰的一声关上，她就走了。那时美里心事重重，无暇顾及她。

Ikari Shinji... Misato still wondered sometimes how he had looked at her and how he would come to remember her in the future. Ikari Gendo's son had informed her quietly that he was leaving, thanked her for everything, and disappeared soon after. Not a word to his father.  
碇真嗣...美里有时仍会想，他是如何看待她的，将来又会如何回忆她。碇源堂的儿子平静地告诉她他要离开，感谢她所做的一切，随后就消失了。没有对父亲留下只言片语。

With her apartment now quiet and empty, a dismal change from the usual affairs of the Katsuragi residence, Misato moved into Kaji's residence—and was even more dismayed to find his backyard consisting solely of a huge patch of dried up watermelons. In time she'd replanted some and cut out dead vines, and now they produced more watermelons than she could ever eat. The younger children around her neighborhood would come by from time to time and she'd give her watermelons to them to take home. She had no use for them and furthermore, knew it was what Kaji would have done.  
随着她的公寓变得寂静空旷，与葛城家往常的热闹景象截然不同，美里搬进了加持的住所——更令她沮丧的是，他的后院仅有一大片干枯的西瓜地。不久后，她重新种植了一些，并清理了枯死的藤蔓，如今这些西瓜的产量已远超她能食用的数量。附近的小孩子们时不时会来拜访，她便将西瓜送给他们带回家。她并不需要这些西瓜，而且她也知道，这是加持会做的事情。

She didn't know anything about any of the other Nerv employees. Nothing of Rei, the shy and quiet girl. Nothing of Ikari Gendo, Maya Ibuki, or that other guy who'd once had a crush on her—she couldn't even remember his name now, twelve years later.  
她对其他 NERV 员工一无所知。对那个害羞安静的绫波零一无所知。对碇源堂、伊吹玛亚，或是那个曾经暗恋过她的家伙——十二年后，她甚至记不起他的名字。

A bustling young nurse, appearing maybe ten years younger than her, brushed past her and entered Asuka's room, glancing at her curiously. Misato backed away a little so she wouldn't seem as if she were intruding.  
一位忙碌的年轻护士，看起来可能比她小十岁左右，匆匆经过她，进入了明日香的房间，好奇地看了她一眼。美里稍稍后退，以免显得像是在打扰。

She watched Asuka smile in a childlike way upon seeing the nurse, but she never spoke a word. Misato was startled. Not only had Asuka perhaps gone insane, but now she was also mute?  
她看着明日香像孩子一样对护士微笑，但她一句话也没说。美里感到震惊。不仅明日香可能已经疯了，现在她还成了哑巴？

She knew Asuka wouldn't be ready to face her yet, ready to face the horrors of her past. Misato backed away slowly, leaving her ragged bouquet on the windowsill.  
她知道明日香还没有准备好面对她，准备好面对过去的恐怖。美里慢慢后退，把她那束破旧的花束留在了窗台上。

= = = = = = =

"Asuka-chan!" “明日香酱！”

Asuka looked up from her fifth orange and smiled happily, but didn't say a word.  
明日香从她的第五个橙子上抬起头，开心地笑了，但一句话也没说。

Hazuki-san pulled over a chair and sat down next to Asuka. "Would you like to go for a walk outside?"  
Hazuki-san 拉过一把椅子，坐在 Asuka 旁边。“你想出去散散步吗？”

Asuka nodded. She had never seen the little garden outside that her nurse had been telling her about. Hazuki-san grinned, but the expression wore off slowly as she noticed the increasing pile of orange peels on and under the blanket.  
Asuka 点点头。她从未见过护士一直跟她提起的那个小花园。Hazuki-san 咧嘴一笑，但笑容渐渐消失，因为她注意到毯子上和下面的橘子皮越堆越多。

"Asuka-chan...how many oranges did you eat...?!"  
“Asuka-chan...你到底吃了多少个橘子？！”

Asuka paused, then held up all the fingers of her right hand.  
明日香停顿了一下，然后举起了右手所有的手指。

Hazuki-san stared. 风见先生瞪大了眼睛。

Asuka got out of bed herself, planting both feet toes-first on the floor and waiting as Hazuki-san pulled her chair back to its proper place. "There's a lady outside your room with long purple hair. Do you know her?"  
明日香自己下了床，双脚先着地，等待风见先生将椅子拉回原位。“你房间外有一位长着紫色长发的女士。你认识她吗？”

Misato is here? 美里在这里吗？

The name came to Asuka's head immediately, and she was afraid her facial expression would give it away. Quickly she shook her head.  
这个名字立刻浮现在明日香的脑海中，她担心自己的面部表情会泄露秘密。她迅速摇了摇头。

"No?" Hazuki-san was not disappointed. "Never mind that then, let's go outside."  
“没有吗？” Hazuki-san 并未感到失望。“没关系，那我们出去吧。”

The German redhead followed her nurse outside, looking around cautiously.  
那位德国红发女子跟着她的护士走了出去，小心翼翼地环顾四周。

"She left her flowers." “她留下了她的花。”

She brought me flowers? 她给我带了花？

Hazuki-san picked up the wilted bouquet and handed it to Asuka. The girl was silent in thought, wondering whether it was for the better or worse that she had missed Katsuragi-san. She fiddled with the bouquet for a few minutes, then pulled out the pink daisies and threw the rest into the trash.  
风见学姐捡起那束枯萎的花束，递给了明日香。女孩陷入了沉思，不知道错过桂学姐是好是坏。她摆弄了几分钟花束，然后抽出粉色的雏菊，把剩下的扔进了垃圾桶。

"There will be much prettier flowers in the garden, Asuka-chan."  
“花园里会有更漂亮的花，明日香酱。”

Asuka spun the flowers in her hands, forming a ring of pink petals and yellow stems, then tucked them behind her ear. Hazuki-san moved towards the elevator and beckoned for her to follow.  
明日香在手中旋转着花朵，形成了一圈粉色的花瓣和黄色的花茎，然后将它们别在耳后。风见学姐走向电梯，示意她跟上。

Her patient surprised her a moment later, however, as she stepped inside and reached over to press the button labeled "1".  
然而，她的病人片刻后给了她一个惊喜，当她走进去并伸手按下了标有“1”的按钮。

Of the two people in the metal box, Asuka was the more surprised. She had not known exactly what an elevator was, but she had certainly known what to do once she got in it. And—Asuka glanced towards the panel of buttons again—goodness, there were more than fifteen. Just how had she happened to pick the correct one?  
在这金属箱子里的两个人中，明日香更为惊讶。她并不确切知道电梯是什么，但她确实知道一旦进入后该怎么做。而且——明日香再次瞥向按钮面板——天哪，有超过十五个按钮。她究竟是如何碰巧选对了正确的那个呢？

Hazuki-san's face was shining with excitement, so Asuka smiled too and took it as a big leap towards becoming the girl she had been.  
风见优辉的脸庞洋溢着兴奋，于是明日香也微笑着，将其视为向她曾经的样子迈进的一大步。

The doors opened and Asuka stepped out first, then realized that she didn't know where to go and felt very foolish. Hazuki-san laid a comforting hand on her shoulder and gently steered her to the left. As they walked down the lobby, Hazuki-san greeted other nurses and doctors, all of which nodded in greeting and hurried away. Asuka was interested in everything and kept wanting to stay behind and watch.  
门开了，明日香率先走了出来，随即意识到自己不知道该去哪里，感到十分尴尬。Hazuki-san 轻轻地把手放在她的肩上，温柔地引导她向左转。他们穿过大厅时，Hazuki-san 向其他护士和医生打招呼，所有人都点头致意后匆匆离去。明日香对一切都充满好奇，总是想留下来观看。

"The really pretty things are outside," Hazuki-san told her, when Asuka discovered a new fascination in carrying people in stretchers.  
“真正美丽的东西在外面，”当明日香对搬运担架上的人产生新兴趣时，Hazuki-san 告诉她。

The glass door before Asuka opened to reveal what she could only imagine was paradise. There was a small waterfall running into a pond in which goldfish swam. Around it grew a variety of flowers, blooming in all colors. Like a hummingbird, Asuka darted from this flower to that one, and finally came to a stop in front of the pond. Hazuki-san had had enough of chasing her and was sitting on one of the many rocks that formed the border of the pool.  
明日香面前的玻璃门打开，展现在她眼前的景象，她只能想象那是天堂。一个小瀑布流入池塘，金鱼在其中游弋。周围生长着各种花卉，五彩缤纷地绽放。明日香像蜂鸟一样，从这朵花飞到那朵花，最后停在池塘前。Hazuki-san 追她追得够呛，便坐在池边众多岩石中的一块上休息。

Asuka got on her knees and extended a hand into the cold water. The fish darted away. Startled, she pulled her hand out back out and let the water drip onto the surrounding rocks.  
明日香跪下身来，将手伸进冰冷的水中。鱼儿迅速游走。她吓了一跳，赶紧把手缩回，任由水滴落在周围的岩石上。

Hazuki-san laughed and, not to Asuka's surprise, began to tell her the story of how the garden and its flowers had come to be.  
Hazuki-san 笑了，不出明日香所料，开始讲述这个花园及其花朵是如何形成的。

Their shared excitement masked the sound of a blue car, driven by a very agitated purple-haired woman, pulling out of the hospital parking lot so violently that she was narrowly avoiding being tipped over at each turn.  
他们共同的兴奋掩盖了一辆蓝色汽车的声音，驾驶座上是一位非常焦躁的紫发女子，她猛地驶出医院停车场，每次转弯都险些翻车。

Author's Notes: Misato has entered the picture...and backed out of it again. She'll be back, though; I thought it'd be nice to add a bit of flashback, show how things went. As usual, drop me a review... tell me how I'm doing. Thanks so much to those of you who have already reviewed!  
作者的话：美里已经登场...又退场了。不过她还会回来的；我想加入一些闪回片段会很好，展示事情是如何发展的。一如既往，欢迎留下评论...告诉我做得如何。非常感谢那些已经留下评论的朋友们！

### Chapter 4: Misato Returns  
第四章：美里归来  

Asuka was drawing in her notebook, the one Hazuki-san had brought her. She touched the creamy pale green pages with her fingertips and remembered the cherry blossoms she'd seen outside the other day.  
明日香正在她的笔记本上画画，那是长月小姐带给她的。她用指尖轻触着奶油般淡绿色的纸页，回想起前几天在外面看到的樱花。

A smile crept onto her face, then quickly vanished as she turned to look at her window. Had someone been watching her?  
一丝微笑爬上她的脸庞，随即迅速消失，她转头看向窗户。难道有人在监视她？

She remained sitting straight up for several moments, watching the blinds carefully. There was no motion. Asuka turned back to her book and squeezed her fingers around the pencil, watching her nail turn white and back to pink as she lessened the pressure. She was trying to draw the monster she'd seen and been inside, the red thing she knew to be called Eva.  
她保持笔直坐姿好一会儿，仔细观察着百叶窗。没有任何动静。明日香转回书本，手指紧握铅笔，看着指甲因用力而变白，又随着压力减轻恢复粉红。她正试图描绘出她所见并曾置身其中的怪物，那个她知道被称为 Eva 的红色生物。

Muffled sounds came from outside her room, and a high, feminine laugh.  
她房间外传来模糊的声响，以及一声高亢的女性笑声。

Asuka was curious. 明日香感到好奇。

She tucked her notebook back under her pillow, where she hid it nowadays, and crept over to the blinds. Things became very silent. She got down on her knees and slid up the wall slowly, an inch at a time, until her eye was level with the windowsill. Gently she pried away one plastic strip of the blinds.  
她将笔记本重新塞回枕头下，那是她如今藏匿它的地方，然后蹑手蹑脚地走向窗帘。四周变得异常寂静。她跪下身，缓缓地沿着墙壁向上挪动，一寸一寸地，直到眼睛与窗台齐平。她轻轻地拨开窗帘的一条塑料条。

There was no one. 外面空无一人。

Asuka was confused. 明日香感到困惑。

She got back into bed and pulled the thin blanket over her knees, then reached for her notebook and her pencil. Her sketches were proof of her frustration; Asuka had torn out many a page and tossed it into the wastebasket in annoyance. Her latest try had still looked nothing like the Eva she could see so clearly in her mind. She drew another harsh line down the side of the page, dissecting several cherry blossoms as she did so.  
她重新躺回床上，拉过薄毯盖在膝盖上，随后伸手去拿笔记本和铅笔。她的素描是她沮丧的证明；明日香撕掉了许多页，恼怒地扔进了废纸篓。她最近的尝试仍然与她脑海中清晰的 Eva 形象相去甚远。她在纸的边缘又画了一道粗重的线条，顺手切开了几朵樱花。

Asuka wondered how long she'd been in this hospital. Approximately two weeks since she'd woken up, but she didn't know how long she'd been in a coma—and if she intended not to talk, there wasn't any way to ask Hazuki- san. Her days were dreary, and she was finding herself bored easily. She'd found a convenient way to eat all the fruit she had been provided with and was left with only two oranges and a banana.  
明日香不知道自己在这家医院住了多久。大约从她醒来后已经过去了两周，但她不知道自己昏迷了多久——而且如果她不打算开口说话，就无法向长月小姐询问。她的日子变得沉闷，发现自己很容易感到无聊。她找到了一个方便的方法吃掉了所有提供的水果，只剩下两个橙子和一根香蕉。

She wanted to leave this hospital, but knew in the depths of her heart that there was nowhere for her to go. She had a name now, but still no identity.  
她想离开这家医院，但内心深处明白自己无处可去。她现在有了名字，但仍然没有身份。

It was late afternoon when her nurse stopped in to see how she was doing.  
傍晚时分，她的护士进来查看她的状况。

"The purple-haired lady is back, Asuka-chan," she told her, as she straightened out the bed. "She's been here three times today already, but seems to always leave as soon as she sees me."  
“紫发的女士又来了，明日香，”她一边整理床铺一边告诉她，“今天她已经来过三次了，但每次一看到我就立刻离开。”

Misato's back? 美里回来了？

Asuka stared, surprised. 明日香瞪大了眼睛，感到惊讶。

"Do you want to see her?"  
“你想见她吗？”

Asuka thought, and looked down at her knees. Would Misato have changed as much as she had? Would she try to bombard her with memories of the past?  
明日香思索着，低头看向自己的膝盖。美里会像她一样变了很多吗？她会不会试图用过去的记忆来轰炸她？

"You don't have to if you don't want to, Asuka-chan," Hazuki-san added hastily.  
“如果你不想，就不必这么做，明日香酱，” 速水小姐急忙补充道。

But Asuka had made up her mind. She sat up quickly, her eyes pleading with Hazuki-san silently as her head bobbed up and down quickly.  
但明日香已经下定了决心。她迅速坐起身，双眼无声地恳求着速水小姐，头快速地点着。

Hazuki-san was hesitant. "Are you sure?"  
速水小姐有些犹豫。“你确定吗？”

Another series of enthusiastic nodding, until Asuka thought her head might fall off.  
又是一阵热情的点头，直到明日香觉得自己的头都快掉下来了。

The nurse smiled. "I'll go get her."  
护士微笑着说：“我去叫她。”

= = = = = = =

Misato was back again, for the third time—and this way she'd found her way to Asuka's room without having to ask for directions once.  
美里又回来了，这是第三次——而且这次她找到了明日香的房间，一次路都没问。

Three days had passed since her initial visit. In those days she had spent plenty of time mulling around her watermelons, thinking things over, and whenever her thoughts got muddled—she drove back to the hospital. There was something calming about simply watching her former charge's simple play.  
自她初次探访已过去三天。这些天里，她花了不少时间在西瓜地徘徊，反复思索，每当思绪混乱时——她便驱车返回医院。仅仅是看着她曾经的照顾对象简单地玩耍，就有种令人平静的力量。

She was there now, leaning casually against the back wall of the hallway, when the door opened again. Automatically she stepped back to let the nurse pass.  
此刻她就在那里，随意地靠在走廊的后墙上，这时门再次打开。她本能地后退，让护士通过。

However, she was mistaken; the woman wanted to speak to her.  
然而，她误会了；那位女士想和她交谈。

"Asuka-chan would like to see you," she said simply.  
“明日香想见你。”她简单地说道。

Misato was shocked and surprised. The first thing that came out of her mouth was, "I...I didn't bring any flowers."  
美里既震惊又惊讶。她脱口而出的第一句话是：“我……我没带花来。”

The nurse laughed. "She won't care. Go on in."  
护士笑了。“她不会介意的。进去吧。”

Misato hesitated, not sure what to do, now that she was faced with the prospect of seeing Asuka. Would she recognize her? Would she...  
美里犹豫了，面对即将见到明日香的局面，她不确定该怎么做。她会认出她吗？她会……

The former Nerv commander's last thought was cut off as two small but well- meaning hands pushed her into room 212 and closed the door behind her.  
前 NERV 指挥官的最后一个念头被两双虽小却充满善意的手打断，那双手将她推进了 212 号房间，并随后关上了门。

"Hello, Asuka." “你好，明日香。”

She was sitting up in bed, a pencil in hand, evidently writing something. Her blue eyes were large, fixed clearly on Misato's aging face. Her long, shiny copper hair, always fastened back with two red hairclips, now streamed down her back, restrained only by a pink ribbon.  
她坐在床上，手里握着一支铅笔，显然在写着什么。她那双湛蓝的大眼睛专注地凝视着美里日渐衰老的面庞。她那一头闪亮的铜色长发，平日里总是用两个红色发夹固定在脑后，此刻却如瀑布般垂落，仅由一根粉色丝带束住。

Misato felt very out of place. Perhaps Asuka would not appreciate her presence at all.  
美里感到非常不自在。或许明日香根本不会欢迎她的到来。

Slowly, Asuka raised her hand and flexed her fingers slowly in a gesture of friendliness. Surprised, Misato came closer and pulled over a chair.  
缓缓地，明日香举起手，慢慢地弯曲手指，做出一个友好的手势。美里惊讶地走近，拉过一把椅子坐下。

"How are you doing?" "你好吗？"

It was hard enough, Misato thought, to keep up a conversation with someone you hadn't seen in twelve years, especially when you'd left off on a bad note, but to do it with someone who was now also mute? She closed her eyes.  
“和十二年未见的人保持对话已经够难了，尤其是当初不欢而散的情况下，”美里想，“但和一个现在还哑巴了的人对话？她闭上了眼睛。”

"I'm fine." "我很好。"

Misato's brown eyes fluttered open. Had she really spoken? Was she hallucinating? She blinked several times, trying to hide her surprise.  
美里棕色的眼睛微微睁开。她真的说出口了吗？还是在幻觉中？她眨了几次眼，试图掩饰自己的惊讶。

"I'm glad to hear that," she mustered at last, accompanying her words with a smile.  
“听到你这么说，我很高兴。”她终于鼓起勇气说道，脸上随之绽放出微笑。

Asuka smiled then, slowly, and relaxed. She leaned back against her pillows and closed her notebook with an easy, jaunty movement and shoved it under the pillow. The pencil she placed on her bedside table.  
明日香随即笑了，慢慢地，整个人放松下来。她向后靠在枕头上，轻松随意地将笔记本合上，塞到枕头下。铅笔则放在床头柜上。

"How have you been?" “你最近怎么样？”

= = = = = = =

The first two words she'd spoken in days were hard to release, but the excitement that shone on Misato's face was worth every bit of initial embarrassment Asuka had felt. Yes, now she was finally ready to talk, and she wanted to know everything.  
这是她几天来第一次开口说话，虽然起初有些尴尬，但看到美里脸上闪烁的兴奋，这一切都值得。是的，现在她终于准备好交谈了，她想知道所有的事情。

Misato looked more comfortable now that she had initiated a question, and chose her words carefully. "Well, I've moved out of our old apartment, and into a larger, single house now," she said. "It's got a big garden in the backyard, and children like to come and play in it."  
美里现在看起来更自在了，因为她已经提出了一个问题，并且谨慎地选择着词句。“嗯，我已经搬出了我们以前的公寓，住进了一个更大的独栋房子，”她说。“后院有一个大花园，孩子们喜欢来那里玩耍。”

Asuka didn't make the connection between "big house" and "Kaji's old house". Neither did she realize that the "big garden" was filled with "watermelons".  
明日香并没有将“大房子”与“加持的旧宅”联系起来。她也没有意识到那个“大花园”里满是“西瓜”。

"Is there any beer in your house?"  
“你家里有啤酒吗？”

She remembers the beer? Misato was shocked.  
她记得啤酒？美里感到震惊。

"No, not anymore," she said, laughing a little. "I've stopped drinking since—well, a long time ago."  
“不，不再喝了，”她轻笑道，“我已经戒酒很久了——嗯，很久以前就戒了。”

Silence dominated the next few moments.  
接下来的片刻，沉默占据了主导。

Asuka was quiet, wondering if she dared ask the question that had been whirring in her mind. She decided to go ahead with it, although she wasn't sure if she wanted to hear the answer or not.  
明日香沉默着，心中犹豫是否该问出那个一直在她脑海中盘旋的问题。她决定还是问出口，尽管她不确定自己是否真的想听到答案。

"Misato." "美里。"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

Asuka paused, then assumed a faint air of confidence. "Tell me about...Rei, and Shinji."  
明日香顿了顿，随即摆出一丝自信的神情。"告诉我关于……丽和真嗣的事。"

Misato was very quiet, thinking this over.  
美里非常安静，仔细思考着这个问题。

"Misato?" “美里？”

She hasn't changed much, Misato thought. "Would you like to know more about what they were like before, or where they are now?"  
她变化不大，美里心想。“你想了解更多他们以前的样子，还是他们现在的情况？”

She half expected the words to earn her a slap in the face. The Asuka she remembered would easily have taken the first half of her sentence as an insult of her usually excellent memory. The second half could get her into trouble because she honestly didn't know what had happened to them.  
她半期待着这些话会招来一记耳光。她记忆中的明日香，通常会轻易地将她话的前半部分视为对她一向出色的记忆力的侮辱。后半部分则可能给她带来麻烦，因为她真的不知道他们之间发生了什么。

But Asuka, in her new quiet tone of voice, replied, "Anything you would like."  
但明日香用她新的平静语调回答道：“你喜欢的任何事。”

"Hmm. Let me think." Misato bought herself some time as she frantically tried to think. What could she tell Asuka, that would not be related to Evangelion, the angels, and Nerv?  
“嗯，让我想想。”美里为自己争取了一些时间，她拼命地思考着。她能告诉明日香什么，既不涉及福音战士、使徒和 NERV 呢？

"Ikari Shinji and Ayanami Rei were your classmates," she began slowly. "Shinji lived in the same apartment as you and me." She went out on a limb, continuing, "I remember that you liked to call him 'baka'."  
"碇真嗣和绫波零是你的同学，"她缓缓开始说道，"真嗣和你我住在同一间公寓。"她冒险继续说，"我记得你总喜欢叫他'笨蛋'。"

"Yes, I remember too," Asuka said, without a hint of vengeance, and shocked Misato yet again. "But I don't remember why I did."  
"是的，我也记得，"明日香说道，没有一丝怨恨，再次让美里感到震惊。"但我记不清为什么这么叫他了。"

Misato diverted the subject. "What else do you remember about Shinji? Or Rei?"  
美里转移了话题。"关于真嗣或绫波，你还记得些什么？"

"Shinji was...tall, and skinny, with brown hair," Asuka said slowly. Her gaze was directed at the leg of Misato's chair. She frowned as she thought. "Rei was... very quiet. I don't remember her saying much."  
"真嗣他...很高，又瘦，棕色头发，" 明日香缓缓说道。她的目光落在美里椅子的腿上。她皱着眉头，努力回忆。"丽她...非常安静。我不记得她说过多少话。"

That's all she remembers, Misato thought. Not much for having spent over a year with them.  
这就是她记得的全部了，美里心想。和他们共度了一年多，却记得不多。

"Misato." "美里。"

"Yes, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"Tell me about Eva." “告诉我关于伊娃的事。”

Her words were direct, each spoken clearly and evenly. Asuka was conscious of herself leaning forward, wanting to know the truth. She had finally met someone who could help her identify herself, and she wanted to milk it for all that it was worth.  
她的言辞直截了当，每个字都清晰而平稳地吐出。明日香意识到自己正前倾着身子，渴望了解真相。她终于遇到了一个能帮助她认清自我的人，她想要充分利用这一点。

Misato said, "Are you sure?"  
美里说：“你确定吗？”

Without a hint of hesitance: "Yes. I want to know everything."  
毫不犹豫地回答：“是的，我想知道一切。”

So Misato pulled her chair closer and began. She told her former charge of the Eva Unit 02 that she had controlled, of the Evas of Rei and Shinji. She told her about the angels, Tokyo-3, and Nerv. There was so much to talk about, Misato mused, as she continued about Ikari Gendo and Akagi Ritsuko, the Magi computers, how the Second Child had been brought to Japan from Germany. How strange this must sound to a girl who had experienced nothing beyond a soft bed, oranges, and a trip to the garden, yet had gone through more than most people her age would ever face.  
于是美里拉近椅子，开始讲述。她向她曾经负责的二号机驾驶员讲述了零号机和初号机，讲述了使徒、第三新东京市和 NERV。她谈到了碇源堂和赤木律子，MAGI 计算机，以及如何从德国将第二适格者带到日本。对于一个只经历过柔软的床铺、橙子和一次花园之旅的女孩来说，这一切听起来一定很奇怪，然而她所经历的却远超同龄人的想象。

When she paused, nearly thirty minutes later, Misato was afraid of Asuka's reaction.  
当她停下时，已近三十分钟后，美里担心明日香会有何反应。

Instead, Asuka smiled. "Thank you."  
相反，明日香笑了。“谢谢你。”

Misato was beginning to wonder if the new Asuka would ever cease to surprise her.  
美里开始怀疑，新的明日香是否永远都会让她感到惊讶。

Asuka relaxed and lay back down, crossing her legs. "Tell me about what I was like, Misato."  
明日香放松下来，重新躺下，双腿交叉。“告诉我，我以前是什么样的，美里。”

The commanding Asuka is back.  
威风凛凛的明日香回来了。

A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. "Are you sure you want to know?"  
她嘴角微微上扬，"你确定想知道吗？"

"Yes. I want to know everything. I want to know what I looked like, what kinds of clothes I wore, what I—"  
“是的。我想知道一切。我想知道我看起来什么样，我穿什么样的衣服，我——”

The door opened behind Misato, cutting the redhead off sharply.  
门在 Misato 身后打开，打断了红发女子的谈话。

"Asuka-chan! Why didn't you tell me you could speak perfectly?"  
“Asuka-chan！你怎么没告诉我你能说得这么好？”

The young woman was suddenly at a loss for words. The expression on her nurse's face was one of surprise and hurt. Hurt, Asuka realized with a sinking feeling, that Hazuki-san had done everything for her, yet she had opened up to what was practically a complete stranger instead.  
年轻女子突然语塞。她护士脸上的表情是惊讶和受伤。Asuka 意识到，Hazuki-san 为她做了那么多，她却向一个几乎是完全陌生的人敞开了心扉，这让她感到一阵失落。

"I," Asuka began awkwardly, "...wasn't ready to talk."  
"我，" 明日香尴尬地开口，"...还没准备好谈这件事。"

It was Misato who quickly intervened.  
是美里迅速介入解围。

"I'm sure Asuka will be willing to speak with you later," she said quietly, in a formal tone that implied the end of the matter. Hazuki-san nodded and, not meeting Asuka's eyes, closed the door again.  
"我相信明日香稍后会愿意和你谈谈的，" 她轻声说道，语气正式，暗示此事到此为止。Hazuki-san 点了点头，没有直视明日香的眼睛，再次关上了门。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Asuka, who had temporarily been very busy studying Misato's chair leg again, quickly swung her gaze back up. "Yes, go on."  
暂时忙于再次研究美里椅子腿的明日香，迅速将目光转回。“是的，继续说。”

Misato chuckled. "You were always very direct about your opinions, especially to Shinji. You often liked to call him 'baka' and seemed to regard your missions as a competition of who was a better Eva pilot. As for Rei, she was the favorite of Commander Ikari, and it would annoy you immensely when she disagreed with you. You, me, and Shinji lived together in my apartment, along with my pet penguin Pen-pen—"  
美里轻笑道：“你总是直截了当地表达自己的看法，尤其是对真嗣。你经常喜欢叫他‘笨蛋’，并且似乎把任务看作是比谁更优秀的 Eva 驾驶员的竞赛。至于丽，她是碇司令的宠儿，她与你意见不合时会让你非常恼火。你、我和真嗣一起住在我公寓里，还有我的宠物企鹅 Pen-pen——”

Asuka looked as if she were trying to keep from bursting out in laughter.  
明日香看起来像是在努力忍住不笑出声来。

"What's so funny?" "有什么好笑的？"

"A pet penguin," Asuka replied, "with red feathers growing out of the top of his head. I remember him."  
"一只宠物企鹅，" 明日香回答，"头顶上长着红色的羽毛。我记得他。"

Misato smiled, though the image in her mind was of the many lonely nights she'd spent on the front steps of Kaji's house, looking up at the stars and thinking of the past. She would put her arms around the penguin and rub her cheek against his soft feathers, hoping he understood her feelings.  
美里微笑着，尽管她脑海中浮现的是那些孤独的夜晚，她坐在加持家前的台阶上，仰望星空，思念着过去。她会抱住那只企鹅，用脸颊蹭着它柔软的羽毛，希望它能理解她的情感。

How lonely she still felt sometimes.  
她有时仍感到多么孤独。

"Ne, Asuka." Misato leaned in closer. "When you get out of this hospital, would you like to come and stay with me?" The door opened behind her and the nurse stepped in again. Misato knew it was her time to leave, but she stood her ground.  
"呐，明日香。" 美里靠得更近了。"等你出院后，愿意来和我一起住吗？" 她身后的门打开了，护士再次走了进来。美里知道是时候离开了，但她仍坚定地站在原地。

"Yes, Misato, I would like that very much."  
"是的，美里，我非常愿意。"

Misato smiled. "Then I'll be waiting." She got up and left.  
美里微笑道：“那我就等着了。”她起身离开了。

Author's note: For all you Shinji fans, I promise he'll be here! Not quite sure when, but he's on his way! And as usual, drop me a review, this certainly wasn't my favorite chapter but I'd like to know what you thought.  
作者留言：给所有喜欢真嗣的读者，我保证他会来的！虽然不确定具体时间，但他已经在路上了！一如既往，欢迎留下评论，虽然这一章不是我最喜欢的，但我很想知道你们的想法。

### Chapter 5: Going Home  
第五章：回家  

"Smile, Asuka-chan." “笑一个，明日香。”

The redhead turned slightly to the left and looked directly at the lens as she smiled. Hazuki-san pressed the button and bathed Asuka in a dazzling flash of white.  
红发女孩微微转向左侧，直视着镜头，露出了笑容。Hazuki-san 按下按钮，一道耀眼的白光将明日香笼罩。

Today was a special day for both of them, for Asuka was finally leaving the hospital to go home with Misato. Hazuki-san had finished all her paperwork, then presented her with a small bundle. Inside were two things: the old blue-green dress she had worn upon arriving, now clean and devoid of tears, along with a new summer dress of light pink with little strawberries scattered across the soft cotton.  
今天对他们两人来说都是特别的日子，因为明日香终于要离开医院，和美里一起回家了。薰小姐已经完成了所有手续，然后递给她一个小包裹。里面有两样东西：她刚来时穿的那件旧蓝绿色连衣裙，现在干净整洁，没有一丝皱褶，还有一件新的浅粉色夏季连衣裙，柔软的棉布上点缀着小草莓图案。

It was in this dress that Asuka was posing now, in the garden outside, as a memoir for her nurse.  
正是穿着这件连衣裙，明日香此刻正在花园外摆姿势，为她的护士留下纪念。

The day had been special to start with. She had woken up early, had brushed her own hair and teeth—a big achievement for her—and eaten breakfast in the cafeteria with Hazuki-san (oranges, as usual, and cereal). Now that her mini photo shoot was done, they headed back into the lobby. Misato was due any minute.  
这一天从一开始就很特别。她早早醒来，自己梳了头发、刷了牙——这对她来说是个巨大的进步——然后在食堂和薰小姐一起吃了早餐（依旧是橙子和麦片）。现在她的迷你摄影结束了，他们回到大厅。美里随时可能到达。

Hazuki-san headed off to quickly check up on a few patients, promising to return quickly. Asuka nodded and settled herself on a chair, balancing both arms evenly on the black leather armrests. She clicked her heels on the smooth tiled floor, then held both legs up straight in front of her so that she could inspect her shoes. They were clean and the buckles were shiny. She returned her feet to the floor and her gaze to the door.  
风见先生匆匆去查看几位病人，承诺很快回来。明日香点点头，在椅子上坐定，双臂平稳地搭在黑色皮革扶手上。她用鞋跟敲击着光滑的瓷砖地面，然后将双腿笔直地抬起，以便检查鞋子。它们干净整洁，扣环闪闪发亮。她将脚放回地面，目光转向门口。

The two sides split open neatly as a young woman about her age appeared, leading a little boy by the hand. The child was whimpering and cowering against his mother's legs. Exasperated, the mother reached down and pulled the boy up into her arms.  
两扇门整齐地分开，一位与她年龄相仿的年轻女子出现，手里牵着一个小男孩。孩子抽泣着，躲在母亲腿后。母亲无奈地弯腰将男孩抱起。

Interested, Asuka kept watching them as they stopped by the front desk, and then came over to sit by her. The mother sat down a few seats down and immediately closed her eyes, but the boy slowly overcame his initial fear and came over to plop himself down on the seat beside Asuka.  
明日香好奇地继续观察他们，看着他们走到前台，然后过来坐在她旁边。母亲在几个座位之外坐下，立刻闭上了眼睛，但男孩渐渐克服了最初的恐惧，走过来坐在明日香旁边的座位上。

Asuka was suddenly not sure what to do or say, but he fixed that problem for her.  
明日香突然不确定该做什么或说什么，但他为她解决了这个问题。

"Hi!" His face burst into a wide smile.  
"嗨！" 他的脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。

"Hi," Asuka said quietly. Encouraged, the boy moved closer, and reached for the package containing her old clothes. Instinctively the redhead moved it away.  
"嗨，" 明日香轻声回应。受到鼓励，男孩靠近了些，伸手去拿装有她旧衣服的包裹。红发女孩本能地将其移开。

"What's that?" He stood on tiptoe, using one hand to balance himself while pointing with the other.  
“那是什么？”他踮起脚尖，一只手保持平衡，另一只手指着。

"Kiyoshi, don't bother the nice lady," his mother called.  
“清志，别打扰那位好心的女士，”他妈妈喊道。

He paid no attention, and placed one hand on Asuka's knee as he attempted to reach for the package. Worried now, Asuka raised it high, out of his reach, and slid as far away as the narrow seat would allow her.  
他毫不理会，把手放在明日香的膝盖上，试图去够那个包裹。明日香担心起来，把它高高举起，超出他的触及范围，并尽可能地向狭窄座位的另一端挪去。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

The tall purple-haired woman felt an instinct to laugh at Asuka's situation, as well as the expression of surprise she wore, but didn't as she deftly took the package from her outstretched hand. "Come on, let's go."  
那位高挑的紫发女子本能地想嘲笑明日香的处境和她脸上的惊讶表情，但她没有笑，而是灵巧地从她伸出的手中接过包裹。“来吧，我们走。”

Asuka stood up and darted away from the child, who sat down and promptly started to cry. She glanced at him hesitantly, but the mother got up and removed him from her sight.  
明日香站起来，迅速离开那个孩子，孩子随即坐下开始哭泣。她犹豫地看了他一眼，但那位母亲站起身来，将他从她的视线中移开。

"Asuka." The redhead turned to face Misato, standing nearly ten paces ahead of her. "Are you ready?"  
"明日香。" 红发少女转身面对着站在她前方约十步远的美里。"你准备好了吗？"

"Hazuki-san said she'd be here."  
"Hazuki-san 说她会在这里。"

Misato put two and two together and remembered the nurse. Asuka lingered just a moment more, sensing Misato's impatience to leave.  
美里将这些信息串联起来，想起了那位护士。明日香又多停留了一会儿，感觉到美里急于离开的焦躁。

"Let's go." “我们走吧。”

The twin glass doors split open to let them pass, then shut again behind them. Misato handed the package back to Asuka and transferred both hands to the handle of her purse. Halfway down the stairs, Misato pulled out a tiny remote and pressed a button on it. Somewhere in the distance a beep sounded, followed by a click.  
双层玻璃门向两侧分开，让他们通过，随后又合上了。美里将包裹递还给明日香，双手握住手提包的提手。下到楼梯一半时，美里掏出一个微型遥控器，按下了上面的一个按钮。远处传来一声哔响，紧接着是咔嗒声。

She opened the door to the passenger's seat, but the girl was motionless, her gaze fixed on the large white building from which they had just emerged.  
她打开了副驾驶座的门，但女孩一动不动，目光凝视着他们刚刚走出的那座白色大楼。

I'm going home. 我要回家了。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

Asuka ducked her head as she crept into the car. Misato slammed the door and got into her seat, then fastened her seatbelt. She stamped on the accelerator and the car shot forward. Next to her, Asuka let out a shriek as she was thrown against the glove compartment. The car thudded to a stop as Misato transferred her foot to the brake.  
明日香低着头悄悄钻进车里。美里砰地一声关上车门，坐到驾驶座上，系好安全带。她一脚踩下油门，车子猛地向前冲去。旁边的明日香被甩向仪表盘，发出一声尖叫。美里将脚移到刹车上，车子砰然停下。

"Where's your seat belt?" Misato asked, frowning as she looked at the loosely hanging strap by the side of Asuka's seat. When the redhead was settled again, Misato reached across the car to grab the belt and buckle it in.  
"安全带呢？" 美里皱着眉问道，目光落在明日香座位旁松松垮垮的带子上。当红发少女重新坐好后，美里伸手越过车子，抓住安全带并扣好。

"Thanks," Asuka said meekly.  
"谢谢，" 明日香温顺地回答。

By the end of the violent ride, Asuka had been submitted to every kind of turn and stop possible. Misato slammed on her brakes only twelve feet away from the parking space, and the car rotated around to barely fit between the white lines as it came to a stop.  
在这次狂野的驾驶结束时，明日香经历了所有可能的转弯和急停。美里在离停车位仅十二英尺的地方猛踩刹车，车子旋转着，勉强在白线之间停了下来。

Misato got out and went to help Asuka out, but to her surprise the redhead was already standing on the asphalt when she got there.  
美里下车去帮明日香，但令她惊讶的是，当她到达时，红发女孩已经站在柏油路上了。

"Is this where you live?" She gestured to the woods in front of her.  
“你就住这儿吗？”她指着面前的树林问道。

"No. We'll take a shortcut."  
“不，我们走捷径。”

Some twenty minutes later a small wooden house emerged in front of them, surrounded by a fence of sparsely placed wooden poles. Asuka followed Misato up to the front door and inside the house.  
大约二十分钟后，一座小木屋出现在他们面前，周围是一圈稀疏的木桩围栏。明日香跟着美里走到前门，进了屋。

"Well, welcome home." Misato kicked her shoes off and left them where they landed, approximately ten feet from the door. "You can take a look around if you want. I'll make some lunch."  
“好了，欢迎回家。”美里踢掉鞋子，任由它们落在离门大约十英尺的地方。“你可以随便看看，我去准备午饭。”

Following Misato's example, Asuka took her shoes off and followed her into the kitchen. Misato was boiling water and taking things out of the refrigerator. Asuka looked around, noticing how bare it was—as well as the lack of beer. Even her windows were curtainless and the sun shone in directly through the panes of glass. Immediately beside the kitchen was a small room with a centered wooden table only a foot above the ground. It looked relatively new compared to the rest of the furniture; had Misato bought it for her homecoming? Asuka placed her package on it and wandered to the rest of the house.  
明日香学着美里的样子脱掉鞋子，跟着她进了厨房。美里正在烧水，从冰箱里拿出东西。明日香环顾四周，注意到这里多么简陋——连啤酒都没有。窗户也没有窗帘，阳光直接透过玻璃照射进来。厨房旁边是一个小房间，中间有一张离地仅一英尺的木桌。与屋内其他家具相比，这张桌子看起来相对较新；难道是美里为了她的归来新买的？明日香把包裹放在桌上，然后四处逛了逛。

It was a one-story structure, with only four or five rooms as far as Asuka could see. On the other side of the kitchen was a slightly larger room with two straw mats spread upon the floor and two worn and faded blankets spread upon them. This must be Misato's bedroom, and the other cot must be for her. There was little else in the sparsely furnished room, save for a mirror tacked onto the wall above one cot and an old dresser under it. Asuka came in a little farther and saw that there was a closet too; inside she found various pieces of feminine clothing. Hidden in the back, however, was a stash of old clothing, none of which was folded very neatly—all distinctly male. Asuka pulled out the first article of clothing she could see and held it up.  
这是一栋单层建筑，据明日香所见，只有四五个房间。厨房对面是一个稍大一点的房间，地上铺着两张草席，上面各铺着一条磨损褪色的毯子。这一定是美里小姐的卧室，另一张床应该是给她准备的。这个陈设简陋的房间里几乎没有其他东西，除了挂在一张床上方墙上的镜子和下面的旧梳妆台。明日香又往里走了几步，发现还有一个衣柜；里面挂着各式女装。然而，藏在最里面的是一堆旧衣服，没有一件叠得很整齐——全是明显的男装。明日香抽出第一件能看到的衣服，拿了起来。

It was a man's jacket, dark blue with a triangular pocket in the upper left quadrant.  
这是一件男式夹克，深蓝色，左上角有一个三角形的口袋。

It seemed oddly familiar to her, and Asuka held it close to her chest for a minute, inhaling the deep scent of someone who hadn't touched it in years. Hearing Misato's footsteps, Asuka folded it roughly, shoved it back into the closet, and reappeared just as Misato poked her head in.  
它对她来说似乎很熟悉，明日香将它紧紧抱在胸前，深深地吸了一口多年未触碰过的人留下的气味。听到美里的脚步声，明日香粗略地叠好它，塞回衣柜，然后就在美里探头进来时重新出现。

"Asuka, lunch is ready." “明日香，午饭准备好了。”

= = = = = = =

Asuka was seated opposing Misato at the square table, her legs neatly crossed. In her hand she held a bowl of soup and noodles; on the table in front of her was a basket of bread. She was hesitant to eat at first, tearing her bread into small pieces and taking time to chew each, but Misato's warm familiarity enveloped her quickly, and she began to eat at a similar pace.  
明日香与美里相对而坐于方桌前，双腿整齐交叉。她手中捧着一碗汤面；桌上摆着一篮面包。起初她犹豫着不敢动筷，将面包撕成小块，细细咀嚼，但美里温暖的亲切感很快包围了她，于是她也开始以相近的速度进食。

Misato sat her bowl down with a clunk and waited to Asuka to finish. "Hey, Asuka, is there anything I can show you later?"  
美里将碗重重放下，等待明日香吃完。“嘿，明日香，待会儿有什么想让我给你展示的吗？”

Asuka put her soup down. "Are those watermelons in the backyard?"  
明日香放下汤碗。“后院那些是西瓜吗？”

"Yes, they're just about ripe. We can go out and pick one if you'd like."  
“是的，差不多熟了。如果你想的话，我们可以出去摘一个。”

Asuka nodded in agreement. Hazuki-san had once brought her a whole watermelon and sliced it then and there, in front of her bed. She had been excited to see and taste the frosty red flesh of the fruit. But never had she seen watermelons scattered in a field before...  
明日香点头同意。曾经，葉月小姐给她带来了一整个西瓜，并在她床前当场切开。她当时兴奋地看着并品尝了那冰凉鲜红的果肉。但从未见过西瓜散布在田野中的景象……

She finished her soup and hurried to the door to put on her shoes as Misato cleared the table and stacked the bowls on top of some previously used unwashed utensils.  
她喝完汤，急忙走到门口穿上鞋子，而美里则清理桌子，将碗叠放在一些之前用过未洗的餐具上。

Asuka opened the door and went outside, marveling at the vastness of the world in front of her. In the last few weeks she'd known only her bedroom, the hallway that led to her room, and the garden outside, which now seemed tiny. She'd never imagined such great forests with trees that seemed to reach to the sky. The sky over the hospital had been blemished with the tops of skyscrapers and only patches of blue and white fluffy cloud peeked through.  
明日香打开门，走到外面，惊叹于眼前世界的广阔。在过去的几周里，她只熟悉自己的卧室、通往房间的走廊和外面的花园，现在看来那花园显得很小。她从未想象过如此广袤的森林，树木仿佛直插云霄。医院上空的天际线被摩天大楼的顶端所破坏，只有零星的蓝色和白色蓬松云朵从中透出。

She was still gazing off into the distance when Misato appeared a moment later and led her around the house to the back. The watermelon patch seemed even larger than it had appeared through the window.  
她还在凝视远方时，美里片刻后出现，领着她绕到房子后面。从窗户看出去，西瓜地似乎比之前显得更大了。

Asuka asked, "How do you pick watermelons?"  
明日香问道：“你是怎么挑西瓜的？”

Misato laughed and got down on one knee. "Well, I like to hit them like this," she said, demonstrating. "If it sounds hollow, then it's right for picking."  
美里笑着单膝跪地。“嗯，我喜欢这样敲它们，”她边说边示范。“如果听起来空洞，那就对了。”

Asuka got down beside Misato and patted a watermelon tentatively, half expecting it to explode. Nothing happened. She landed a hard thump and a hollow, drum-like sound came from the fruit.  
明日香也跪在美里旁边，试探性地拍了拍一个西瓜，半期待它会爆炸。什么也没发生。她用力一拍，西瓜发出了空洞的鼓声。

Misato broke the vine and Asuka lifted it, finding it surprisingly heavy. Slices of watermelon weighed so much less, she mused, than a big lump of watermelon.  
美里折断了藤蔓，明日香将其举起，发现它出乎意料地沉重。她思忖着，几片西瓜的重量远不及一大块西瓜。

"Misato-san!" “美里小姐！”

Misato and Asuka, halfway around the house by now, turned around abruptly. The watermelon bounced out of Asuka's hands and landed back in the dirt. A group of children ran over, jumping skillfully over unripe watermelons as they did.  
美里和明日香此时已绕到房子的一半，突然转身。西瓜从明日香手中弹出，落回泥土中。一群孩子跑了过来，他们熟练地跳过未熟的西瓜。

"Misato-san!" "美里小姐！"

Despite the smile on Misato's face, they all stopped short about ten feet from her. None threw themselves into her arms. Their smiles faded into a puzzled expression as five pairs of eyes swiveled to settle on Asuka's face. The redhead suddenly felt very uncomfortable.  
尽管美里脸上挂着微笑，他们都在离她大约十英尺的地方停下了脚步。没有人扑进她的怀里。他们的笑容逐渐变成了困惑的表情，五双眼睛转向阿斯卡的脸。红发女孩突然感到非常不自在。

"This is Sorhyu Asuka Langley," Misato said smoothly, "one of my old friends."  
"这位是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，"美里流畅地介绍道，"是我的一位老朋友。"

One by one they introduced themselves, and slowly Asuka began to feel less intimidated. Misato went inside to get a knife and plates, and Asuka chided herself for feeling scared of them. After all, they were just children, and how old was she?  
他们一个接一个地自我介绍，渐渐地，明日香感到不那么害怕了。美里进屋去拿刀和盘子，明日香责备自己竟然害怕他们。毕竟，他们只是孩子，而她自己又有多大呢？

I don't know, she reminded herself irritably. Much older than them though.  
我不知道，她烦躁地提醒自己。但肯定比他们大得多。

With surprisingly strong arms, the children arranged some large watermelons into a ring without breaking their vines. Each was now sitting on a watermelon, and the oldest of the children pointed to the biggest oblong- shaped fruit.  
孩子们用出奇有力的手臂，将几个大西瓜摆成一圈，却没有弄断瓜藤。现在每个人都坐在一个西瓜上，年龄最大的孩子指向了最大的椭圆形水果。

"That's for you," he told Asuka.  
“这是给你的，”他对明日香说。

So by the time Misato returned, Asuka and her new friends were each seated on a watermelon and making small talk. The girls were mainly interested in her hair and wanted to know why it was that shade of copper-red, which Asuka couldn't explain. The boys were more interested in telling her about how they came over to eat watermelons every day.  
所以当美里回来时，明日香和她的新朋友们各自坐在一个西瓜上，闲聊着。女孩们主要对她的头发感兴趣，想知道为什么是那种铜红色，而明日香也无法解释。男孩们则更热衷于告诉她，他们是如何每天过来吃西瓜的。

"I caught fifteen fireflies here yesterday," one of them announced proudly.  
“我昨天在这里捉了十五只萤火虫，”其中一个自豪地宣布。

"I hope you all haven't been bothering Asuka," Misato said sternly, as she passed out plates. "She's had a long day."  
"我希望你们都没去打扰明日香，" 美里严肃地说，同时分发着盘子。"她今天已经很累了。"

"When can we pick out a watermelon?" one of the younger girls asked.  
"我们什么时候能挑个西瓜呢？" 一个小女孩问道。"

"Asuka's already picked one out," Misato announced, and turned around to get it. A minute later she lowered the large fruit in the center of their ring, and all the kids cheered.  
"明日香已经挑好了一个，" 美里宣布道，转身去取。一分钟后，她将那个大水果放在他们围成的圈中央，所有的孩子们都欢呼起来。"

"This is the best part," one of the girls confided to Asuka.  
“这是最精彩的部分，”其中一个女孩向明日香透露道。

Before Asuka had time to ask, Misato lifted her knife high in the air and sunk it down into the watermelon. The striped rind split with a resounding crack, and all the children cheered. Misato cut slices and passed them out. The boys dug eagerly into their slices, but the girls politely waited, something that they evidently didn't always do, since one of the boys questioned it through a mouthful of watermelon.  
在明日香来得及询问之前，美里高举起刀，猛地刺入西瓜。条纹状的瓜皮伴随着一声响亮的裂开声裂开，所有的孩子们都欢呼起来。美里切好片分发给大家。男孩们急切地啃食着西瓜片，但女孩们则礼貌地等待着，显然她们并不总是这样做，因为一个男孩嘴里塞满西瓜时对此提出了疑问。

"Asuka-san is a guest," the oldest girl replied primly, "and you should wait for her to eat first."  
“明日香小姐是客人，”年纪最大的女孩一本正经地回答，“你应该等她先吃。”

The boys nodded solemnly and all stopped, except for one who turned his head to spit out seeds.  
男孩们郑重地点头，所有人都停了下来，除了一个转过头去吐出籽的家伙。

Asuka held a slice of the slippery fruit in her hand and bit off the top triangle. The sweet juice rolled into all the corners of her mouth and the children cheered again as she swallowed; then all ate heartily.  
明日香手里拿着一片滑溜的水果，咬掉了顶端的三角形。甜美的汁液流遍了她口腔的每个角落，孩子们再次欢呼起来，她咽下后，大家便都大口吃了起来。

"How long will you be staying with Misato-san?"  
“你会和美里小姐待多久？”

Asuka was suddenly at a loss for words. "I... I don't know."  
明日香突然语塞。“我……我不知道。”

"She will be here as long as she wants to," Misato said, grinning, "and you'd better get used to it."  
“只要她愿意，她就会在这里，”美里笑着说，“你最好习惯这一点。”

"I like Asuka-san!" defended the little girl indignantly, and placed her head against Asuka's arm. "Asuka-san, I hope you stay here forever and ever."  
“我喜欢明日香姐姐！”小女孩愤愤不平地辩解道，并将头靠在明日香的手臂上。“明日香姐姐，我希望你永远永远留在这里。”

Asuka and Misato traded smiles.  
明日香和美里交换了微笑。

= = = = = = =

All ready for bed, Asuka sat on her straw mat, with her blanket drawn over her knees and up to her chest as she listened to the sounds of water running from the bathroom.  
准备好睡觉的明日香坐在她的草席上，毯子拉到膝盖上，一直盖到胸前，她聆听着浴室里传来的水流声。

She reviewed the events of the day in her head. Getting ready by herself. Eating breakfast with Hazuki-san. Receiving Hazuki-san's present. Hazuki- san taking pictures of her. Going home with Misato.  
她在脑海中回顾了今天的事件。自己准备。和 Hazuki-san 一起吃早餐。收到 Hazuki-san 的礼物。Hazuki-san 给她拍照。和美里一起回家。

Home, Asuka thought to herself. I have a home now.  
家，明日香心想。我现在有了一个家。

And I can stay here as long as I want. Misato-san said so.  
只要我想，就可以一直留在这里。美里小姐是这么说的。

The door slid open and Misato, dressed for sleep, stepped inside. She got into her cot and shut off the lights.  
门滑开了，穿着睡衣的美里走了进来。她躺到自己的床上，关掉了灯。

"Good night, Asuka." "晚安，明日香。"

"Good night, Misato-san."  
"晚安，美里小姐。"

But long after Misato's snores penetrated the darkness, Asuka was still awake.  
但美里的鼾声早已穿透黑暗许久，明日香却依然清醒。

= = = = = = =

She had put off clearing Asuka-chan's room as long as she could without being scolded by her supervisor. She knew she would miss the girl, and wanted to leave the room like it had been while she lived there was as long as she could. Part of her wanted to believe that the next morning Asuka- chan would be sitting in her bed, as she had been for the last several weeks.  
她尽可能地拖延清理明日香房间的时间，以免被主管责骂。她知道她会想念这个女孩，并希望尽可能长时间地保持房间原样，就像明日香还住在那里一样。她的一部分甚至希望相信，第二天早上明日香会像过去几周那样坐在床上。

But nine o'clock had come, as she had known it would, and with a sense of dread Hazuki-san pushed open the door and entered, first clearing away the tray of uneaten fruit. That left her with nothing to do but to make the bed and change the sheets. Hazuki-san returned to the hallway and pulled in the cart she had brought along. She paid little attention to what she was doing as she tossed sheets, pillows, and blankets into the cart.  
但九点钟还是到来了，正如她所预料的那样，带着一种不祥的预感，小月女士推开门进入房间，首先清理了那盘未吃的水果。剩下的工作就是铺床和换床单。小月女士回到走廊，拉进她带来的推车。她心不在焉地往推车里扔床单、枕头和毯子，几乎没有注意到自己在做什么。

A small colorful object tumbled out from the pillowcase. Hazuki-san caught it before it reached the depths of the hospital cart and recognized it as the notebook she had given Asuka-chan. She flipped it open and inspected its contents.  
一个色彩斑斓的小物件从枕套里滚了出来。小月女士在它掉进医院推车的深处之前接住了它，认出这是她送给明日香的那本笔记本。她翻开笔记本，检查里面的内容。

Each page contained the same sketch, although a definite trend towards clarity showed throughout the book. Hazuki-san's furrowed in confusion as she studied the monster her favorite patient had drawn. There was no doubt about it; despite the arms and legs this was definitely not meant to be a human. Even the eyes sent a shiver down her spine.  
每一页都画着同样的草图，尽管整本书中明显呈现出逐渐清晰的倾向。Hazuki-san 皱着眉头，困惑地研究着她最喜欢的病人所画的怪物。毫无疑问，尽管有四肢，但这绝对不是人类。就连那双眼睛也让她不寒而栗。

Hazuki-san tucked the notebook into the pocket of her hospital gown and continued with her cleaning. Perhaps someday she could get it to Asuka- chan. Then, with a sinking feeling, she remembered that the guilt and regret of missing Asuka-chan's leaving the hospital that morning. She didn't even know where that purple-haired woman lived.  
Hazuki-san 将笔记本塞进病号服的口袋里，继续她的清洁工作。也许有一天她能把它交给 Asuka-chan。然后，一种沉重的感觉涌上心头，她想起了那天早上错过 Asuka-chan 离开医院的内疚和遗憾。她甚至不知道那个紫发女人住在哪里。

Hazuki-san threw everything into one heap upon the cart and pushed it out, shutting off the lights and closing the door behind her.  
Hazuki-san 将所有东西堆在推车上，推着它出去，关掉灯并随手关上了门。

Author's Note: Well, there's Chapter 5, and we finally see Asuka out of the hospital. Now, I have a trivia question for you all... from what anime did I get the name of Asuka's nurse's name?  
作者的话：好了，第五章来了，我们终于看到明日香出院了。现在，我有一个小问题要考考大家……明日香护士的名字是从哪部动漫中得来的？

Thanks for reading...as usual, drop me a review!  
感谢阅读……一如既往，欢迎留下评论！

### Chapter 6: Reunion
"Ahh! ECCHI! What was he doing?! Taking pictures of girls in the changing room!"  
“啊！变态！他在干什么？！在更衣室里给女生拍照！”

Misato laughed at Asuka's shocked reaction. "Boys are boys. They never change." She sipped her tea—a weak substitute for beer, no matter how much she tried to adjust—and leaned forward again. "This one was taken right by the track outside your school—and this one by the pool."  
美里看着明日香震惊的反应笑了起来。“男孩就是男孩。他们永远不会变。”她啜了一口茶——无论怎么调整，都比不上啤酒——然后又向前倾了倾身。“这张是在你们学校外面的跑道旁拍的——这张是在泳池边。”

Asuka nodded as she flipped through the album of pictures, the majority of which featured a younger redhead. "Who took these?"  
明日香点点头，翻看着相册，其中大部分照片都是一位年轻红发女孩的。“这些是谁拍的？”

Misato leaned back again, a thoughtful expression coming over her face. "Well, he was one of your classmates, and his name was Kensuke Aida. He was obsessed with his camera and took pictures of everything he could, especially you."  
美里再次向后靠去，脸上浮现出沉思的表情。“嗯，他是你的一个同学，名叫相田健介。他对相机痴迷不已，能拍的东西他都拍，尤其是你。”

Asuka snorted, and Misato half-expected a vicious comment from her. Instead her expression softened gently and she turned the last page. There were no more.  
明日香哼了一声，美里半期待着她会说出刻薄的话。然而她的表情却柔和了下来，轻轻翻过最后一页。再也没有照片了。

"Why are they here?" “他们为什么在这里？”

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"The pictures." “那些照片。”

"He and Shinji left together—by that time you were gone already. Kensuke was often here in the last few days before their departure, and he left this book here. I haven't seen him since."  
“他和真嗣一起离开的——那时你已经走了。在离开前的最后几天， Kensuke 经常来这里，他留下了这本书。我再也没见过他。”

"Oh." Her fingers returned to the left half of the book and turned a page. "Who was this?"  
"哦。" 她的手指回到书本的左半边，翻过一页。"这是谁？"

Misato glanced at the album. A fierce-looking Japanese boy, with his hands crossed sternly over his chest, glared at her. A wave of sadness washed over her.  
美里瞥了一眼相册。一个面容凶狠的日本男孩，双手严厉地交叉在胸前，瞪着她。一股悲伤涌上心头。

"That's Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke's best friend."  
"那是铃原冬二，真嗣最好的朋友。"

Asuka nodded. Misato wondered if she remembered the incident in Germany, in which Toji had earned himself a slap on either cheek after pulling his pants down in front of the indomitable redhead.  
明日香点了点头。美里不知道她是否还记得德国的那次事件，当时东治因为当着那位不屈的红发女孩面前脱下裤子，而左右脸颊各挨了一巴掌。

"You said Kensuke left with Shinji. What happened to Toji?"  
“你说真嗣和剑介一起走了。东治呢？”

"He was injured in an accident during some testing with the Evas and died a few months later."  
“他在与 EVA 的测试中遭遇事故受伤，几个月后去世了。”

Misato had gradually overcome her fear of frightening Asuka with the blunt truth. The girl had spent the last week craving the truth, searching every nook and cranny of Kaji's house for answers. The former Nerv commander was beginning to regret moving away from her old apartment.  
美里逐渐克服了用直白真相吓到明日香的恐惧。女孩在过去的一周里渴望真相，在加持的房子里搜遍每一个角落寻找答案。这位前 NERV 指挥官开始后悔搬离她的旧公寓。

"There are no pictures of me with Eva, Misato."  
"Misato，我和 Eva 的照片一张也没有。"

"Well, Kensuke wasn't an Eva pilot, so he was never allowed into headquarters. He loved all sorts of war and weapons, so he always wanted to be one...he was very disappointed when all his friends became pilots and he never had the chance."  
"嗯，真希波不是 Eva 驾驶员，所以他从未被允许进入总部。他热爱各种战争和武器，所以一直想成为驾驶员...当他的朋友们都成了驾驶员而他从未有机会时，他非常失望。"

Asuka leafed through the book some more, trying to understand what this boy must have been like. Fortunately she was clothed in the vast majority of the pictures, so this Kensuke Aida must not have been too much of a pervert. She came back to the picture of Toji, wondering what it would take to destroy someone as strong as he must have been.  
明日香继续翻阅着那本书，试图理解这个男孩曾经是怎样的。幸运的是，她在大多数照片中都穿着衣服，所以这个叫做相田剑介的家伙应该不是太变态。她又回到了东治的照片前，思考着要怎样才能摧毁一个像他那样坚强的人。

He looks like a mountain of stone, she thought. Perfectly preserved in the photographic paper, Toji's dark brown eyes glowered at her. Asuka felt almost intimidated, until she noticed someone else in the background.  
他看起来像一座石山，她心想。在相纸上完美保存，东治深褐色的眼睛怒视着她。明日香几乎感到有些胆怯，直到她注意到背景中的另一个人。

Her hair was blue and cut short, but it was the expression that surprised Asuka. The girl was looking directly at the camera, but she was not smiling or appearing enthusiastic—the look on her face was one of pure indifference. Almost as if she could see through Toji and past the camera.  
她的头发是蓝色的，剪得很短，但让明日香惊讶的是她的表情。女孩直视着镜头，但她没有微笑，也没有表现出热情——她的脸上是一种纯粹的冷漠。几乎就像她能看穿东治，透过相机。

"Rei." "丽。"

Misato jumped at the short word. "What about her?"  
Misato 被这简短的词吓了一跳。“她怎么了？”

"She's in this picture." “她在这张照片里。”

Her fatigued muscles complained as she positioned her hand on the armrest and pushed herself up, but Misato said nothing as she got back up and looked at the head Asuka was pointing to. "I never noticed that."  
她疲惫的肌肉在她将手放在扶手上并撑起身体时发出抗议，但 Misato 什么也没说，她重新站起来，看着 Asuka 所指的头像。“我从未注意到那个。”

Asuka held the picture up to her face so closely that she appeared cross- eyed. "She looks so...sad."  
明日香将照片紧贴在脸上，以至于看起来像是斗鸡眼。“她看起来好……悲伤。”

Rei? Sad? When was that girl ever capable of feeling emotion?  
绫波？悲伤？那女孩什么时候有过情感的表现？

But Asuka continued. "Not the kind of sad that you feel when you can't find something, or anything like that. It's the sort of sad that—" and suddenly she realized why she understood; it was because she had recently experienced the same emotions—"—that your purpose in this world isn't significant; that you're not important to anyone."  
但明日香继续说道：“不是那种找不到东西或类似的悲伤。是那种——”突然间她意识到自己为何能理解；因为她最近也经历了同样的情感——“——那种在这个世界上你的存在并不重要；你并不被任何人所重视的悲伤。”

That was a horrible way to put it, she thought.  
她心想，这种说法真是糟糕透顶。

But when Asuka looked up at Misato, her face was contorted with shock.  
但当明日香抬头看向美里时，她的脸上满是震惊的扭曲。

Misato's mind was whirring. How...how incredibly accurate Asuka had been. She chanced a glance at the redhead's innocently curious face. Had anyone, with the exception of Ikari Gendo, ever given a thought to Rei's feelings twelve years ago?  
美里的思绪飞速转动。怎会……明日香说得如此准确。她冒险瞥了一眼红发少女那张天真好奇的脸。除了碇源堂之外，还有谁曾考虑过十二年前绫波的感受呢？

"If I die, there are replacements."  
"如果我死了，还有替代者。"

How much it must have hurt for her to acknowledge that.  
她承认这一点，内心该有多痛。

"Misato?" “美里？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Where's Rei now?" "丽现在在哪里？"

Which one? There are dozens of Reis that you don't know about.  
哪一个？你不知道的绫波有几十个呢。

"I don't know," Misato said truthfully. "I last saw her twelve years ago, the last time you and Shinji came home with me from Nerv Headquarters. I expect Dr. Akagi and Commander Ikari took care of her."  
“我不知道，”美里如实说道，“我上次见她是十二年前，你和真嗣上次跟我从 NERV 总部回家的时候。我想赤木博士和碇司令应该会照顾她。”

"You still talk to Ritsuko, right?"  
“你还和律子联系，对吧？”

"Yes, occasionally. She was the one who told me you were back in Japan."  
“是的，偶尔会。是她告诉我你回到了日本。”

The redhead waved aside that last piece of information. "I'd like to meet her sometime."  
红发女子挥手略过最后那条信息。“我想找个时间见见她。”

It actually might be interesting to invite Ritsuko over. I'll make a proper meal.  
"其实邀请律子过来可能会挺有趣的。我会准备一顿像样的饭菜。”

"I'll tell her that," Misato promised.  
“我会告诉她的，”美里承诺道。

= = = = = = =

Unknown to Misato and Asuka, hidden deep in the depths of the forest within Kaji's house, unusual circumstances brought together two other former Nerv personnel.  
美里和明日香并不知情，在加持家深处的森林中，一些不寻常的情况将另外两名前 NERV 人员聚集在一起。

Dr. Akagi was not one to be aggravated by traffic. She left promptly at seven in the morning every day, breezed her way through the streets, and arrived by eight. She labored long hours over new patents and paperwork alike, then went to lunch. A similar afternoon shift would follow, but at seven she would be off, and another hour later she'd be walking up the steps to her apartment.  
赤木律子博士并非那种会因交通而烦躁的人。她每天早上七点准时出发，轻松穿梭于街道之间，八点前到达。她长时间埋头于新专利和文书工作，然后去吃午餐。下午同样忙碌，但到了七点她就会下班，再过一个小时，她便走上公寓的楼梯。

But she had never seen the usually-quiet streets of Kyoto in such a mess, and even the calm and dignified doctor felt that her fake blonde hair would stand on end if she didn't get out of here soon. Ritsuko tapped her fingers on the steering wheel, a composed expression on her aging face—her forty- second birthday had just passed last week—and applied gentle pressure to the accelerator. The car slid forward just an inch, and the engine whined in impatience.  
但她从未见过京都平日里宁静的街道如此混乱，就连一向沉稳庄重的医生也觉得，如果她不尽快离开这里，她那头假金发恐怕都要竖起来了。律子用手指轻敲着方向盘，她那张日渐衰老的脸上保持着镇定的表情——上周她刚过了四十二岁生日——然后轻轻踩下油门。汽车向前滑行了一英寸，引擎不耐烦地发出哀鸣。

The next traffic light was so far ahead of her that Ritsuko could barely see it, but she heaved a heavy sigh of relief when the car in front of her slowly began moving again. She glanced at her watch. Already she was forty minutes late. She increased pressure on the accelerator and with some effort, managed to hold it there.  
下一个交通灯离她如此之远，律子几乎看不见它，但当她前面的车缓缓开始移动时，她还是长长地松了一口气。她瞥了一眼手表，已经迟到了四十分钟。她加大了油门上的压力，并费了些力气才保持住。

There were only three cars in front of her now, so she'd certainly pass this light. One car hurried across the intersection while the light flicked to a warning yellow. Another car passed, the third following closely on its tail.  
现在她前面只剩下三辆车了，她肯定能通过这个红绿灯。一辆车匆忙穿过十字路口，而信号灯闪烁着警示的黄色。另一辆车通过了，第三辆车紧随其后。

Ritsuko made the mistake of flooring the accelerator just as the light flashed red.  
律子犯了个错误，就在交通灯变红的那一刻，她猛踩了油门。

Her windowpane shattered instantly in the impact of the crash, showering Ritsuko in broken glass. She hung onto the steering wheel, thankful that she had put on a seatbelt—and attempted to stay in place while her car performed several cartwheels and came to a stop.  
她的车窗在撞击中瞬间粉碎，碎玻璃如雨般洒在律子身上。她紧握方向盘，庆幸自己系了安全带——并试图保持不动，任由她的车翻滚几圈后终于停下。

Before she knew it, sirens were wailing, but she wasn't sure if those were in her head or outside her car.  
她还没反应过来，警笛声已经响起，但她分不清这些声音是在她脑海里还是车外。

What she did know what that the sound of tearing metal scared her.  
她确实知道的是，金属撕裂的声音让她感到害怕。

I've become so soft, she thought, annoyed with herself. Such a little thing would never have unnerved the Dr. Akagi Ritsuko of Nerv.  
我变得如此软弱，她自嘲地想，对自己感到恼火。这种小事绝不会让 Nerv 的赤木律子博士感到不安。

"Madam? Are you all right?"  
“夫人？您还好吗？”

Ritsuko waved feebly. 律子无力地挥了挥手。

"She's alive!" the police officer yelled over his shoulder.  
“她还活着！”警察回头大喊。

Twenty minutes later Ritsuko was freed from her totaled car and laid on a stretcher, although she kept trying to get off. Finally the paramedics laid her flat on her back and held her in place with two wide black strips of Velcro.  
二十分钟后，律子从报废的车里被救出，躺在担架上，尽管她一直试图起身。最终，医护人员让她平躺，用两条宽大的黑色维可牢带固定住她。

"I have to go to work," she called out helplessly.  
"我得去上班了," 她无奈地喊道。

"Ritsuko?!" "理津子？！"

"Hey." A burly police officer interfered, holding back the speaker. "She's injured. You can contact her when she's in better condition."  
"嘿。" 一位魁梧的警察插话道，拦住了说话者。"她受伤了。等她状况好些你再联系她吧。"

Nevertheless, the young man ran over to Ritsuko's side and asked for the paramedics to wait. His head was only a dark silhouette to the doctor, as she was looking up into the sun when she faced him.  
尽管如此，年轻人还是跑到律子身边，请求医护人员稍等。医生面对着他，抬头望向太阳，他的头部在她眼中只是一片暗影。

"Ritsuko, is that you?" He was bent over, both hands on his knees, panting heavily.  
“律子，是你吗？”他弯着腰，双手撑在膝盖上，喘着粗气。

"Who are you?" Ritsuko asked quietly, closing her eyes to protect them against the sun. Unfortunately this sent the paramedics into a frenzy, thinking that she was weakening. Whoever had been speaking was quickly shunned and pushed aside, and Ritsuko was carried up and into the ambulance.  
“你是谁？”律子轻声问道，闭上眼睛以避开阳光。不幸的是，这一举动让医护人员以为她情况恶化，纷纷慌乱起来。刚才说话的人很快被推到一旁，律子则被抬上担架，送进了救护车。

"I really have to go to work," she mumbled.  
"我真的得去上班了," 她咕哝道。

Through her closed eyelids she detected a darkening in her surroundings, and when she opened her eyes again she was staring at a blank metal ceiling. People in white robes were bustling around her. Slowly, with immense effort the blonde lifted her wrist high enough that she could see the hands of her watch.  
透过紧闭的眼睑，她察觉到周围环境逐渐变暗，当她再次睁开眼睛时，眼前是一片空白的金属天花板。身着白色长袍的人们在她周围忙碌着。金发女子缓缓地，费了很大力气将手腕抬高到足以看到手表指针的位置。

It was nine o'clock. She felt a gentle prick in her left arm.  
时间是九点整。她感到左臂传来一阵轻微的刺痛。

"I have to go...to work."  
“我得去……上班。”

The words were hard to pronounce. Ritsuko wondered what was happening, until slowly, she drifted off to sleep.  
这些话难以启齿。直到渐渐地，她陷入了沉睡，赤木律子才疑惑着究竟发生了什么。

= = = = = = =

She woke to a nurse working on her arm. Instinctively Ritsuko drew her arm away and in doing so, felt a sharp twinge of pain.  
她醒来时，一位护士正在处理她的手臂。本能地，赤木律子抽回了手臂，随之而来的是一阵剧痛。

"Hold still." The voice was cool and female. "We're not done with you yet."  
"别动。" 声音冷静而女性化。"我们还没处理完你呢。"

Obligingly Ritsuko held out her arm and waited until the nurse finished applying the cast, then sat up when the woman backed away. "How long have I been here?"  
礼子顺从地伸出胳膊，等待护士完成石膏的涂抹，然后在护士退开后坐起身来。"我在这里多久了？"

A glance at the clock. "Almost three hours."  
看了一眼时钟。"差不多三个小时了。"

Ritsuko thought of her boss and shuddered as she imagined what he would say when she finally showed up. The sun was nearly overhead by now, shining brightly down on the inhabitants of Kyoto.  
律子想起了她的上司，不禁打了个寒颤，想象着他见到她时会说些什么。此时太阳已近中天，明亮的阳光洒在京都的居民身上。

She swung her legs over the side of the bed, being careful to use only her right arm, but no sooner had she stood up than the nurse whirled around and ordered that she get back into bed.  
她将双腿从床边摆下，小心翼翼地只用右臂支撑，但刚一站起来，护士就迅速转身命令她回到床上。

"If you're well already, there's an officer waiting outside," she said coldly.  
“如果你已经好了，外面有位警官在等着。”护士冷冷地说道。

"Well then, show him in," Ritsuko replied in the same tone.  
“那么，请他进来吧，”律子用同样的语气回答道。

The nurse shrugged indifferently and strode out, her heels clicking rhythmically on the tiled floor. Ritsuko leaned back against the pillows and wondered what she had done to deserve this woman as her nurse. She glanced down at the flesh-colored cast on her arm and wished that she had asked what was wrong with it. On second thought, maybe she would prefer to avoid contact with that woman as much as possible.  
护士漠不关心地耸了耸肩，大步走了出去，高跟鞋在瓷砖地板上发出有节奏的声响。律子靠在枕头上，心想自己做了什么才摊上这么个护士。她低头看了一眼肉色的石膏手臂，希望自己能知道它出了什么问题。转念一想，或许她宁愿尽可能避免与那个女人接触。

The door slid open again and the same police officer who had held the young man back entered. "Dr. Akagi Ritsuko?"  
门再次滑开，之前拦住年轻人的那位警官走了进来。“赤木律子博士？”

"Yes," she replied. “是的，”她回答道。

He pulled over a chair and let the metal legs scrape the tiles as he did so. "You were involved in an accident, at 9:45 this morning?"  
他拉过一把椅子，金属椅腿在瓷砖上刮擦出声。“你今天早上 9 点 45 分遭遇了一场事故？”

"Yes." "是的。"

He pulled out a notepad and a pen. The walkie-talkie on his waist crackled noisily. "Please describe what happened."  
他掏出笔记本和笔。腰间的对讲机嘈杂地响了起来。“请描述一下发生了什么。”

Ritsuko got it over with as quickly as she could, omitting nothing. The crash had been obviously her fault, she added, and turned over the name of her insurance company.  
律子尽可能迅速地处理完这一切，没有遗漏任何细节。她补充说，事故显然是她的错，并交出了她的保险公司名称。

"How's your arm?" He gestured to the useless limb resting on her lap.  
“你的胳膊怎么样了？”他指了指她搁在膝上的那只无用的手臂。

"I don't know. The nurse didn't tell me."  
“我不知道。护士没告诉我。”

His lips formed a thin line as he got up, roughly pushing the chair backwards with a screeching noise. "Nurse!"  
"他起身时，嘴唇紧抿成一条细线，粗暴地将椅子向后推去，发出刺耳的摩擦声。“护士！””

The harried-looking nurse reappeared. "What is it, officer?"  
"那位神情匆忙的护士再次出现。“怎么了，警官？””

He pointed a thick finger at Ritsuko. "What's wrong with her arm?"  
"他用粗壮的手指指向律子。“她的手臂怎么了？””

"It broke...?" "它坏了...？"

Ritsuko could hardly believe the behavior exhibited by this woman, obviously younger than the police officer—perhaps even younger than she was. The nurse had her eyebrows raised, as if to ask him why he hadn't realized the obvious. The police officer, however, denied her the pleasure of pouncing on his response as he scribbled on his pad.  
理津子几乎无法相信这个显然比警官年轻——甚至可能比她自己还年轻的女子所表现出的行为。护士挑起眉毛，仿佛在问他为何没有意识到显而易见的事。然而，警官却迅速在记事本上涂写，没给她机会抓住他的回答。

"That'll be all, Dr. Akagi. However, the young man whose car collided with yours this morning is outside waiting. I believe he'd like to meet with you."  
"就这样吧，赤城医生。不过，今早与您的车相撞的那位年轻人正在外面等候。我想他希望能与您见面。"

"Officer—" the nurse began, but Ritsuko cut her off.  
"警官——" 护士刚开口，就被律子打断了。

"Of course, please show him in," she requested. The nurse huffed and exited, almost knocking someone over as he tried to enter.  
"当然，请让他进来，" 她请求道。护士哼了一声，退了出去，差点撞上正要进来的人。

"Ritsuko." "律子。"

Ritsuko blinked a few times. Perhaps the effects of the medication were still affecting her. "Shinji?"  
律子眨了几次眼。或许是药物的效果还在影响着她。“真嗣？”

Shinji acknowledged her with a nod of his head.  
真嗣点了点头以示回应。

There was an uncomfortable pause, after which Ritsuko added, "Well, don't stand there by the door, come over here and sit down."  
一阵尴尬的沉默后，律子补充道：“好吧，别站在门口，过来这边坐下。”

Shinji did so, taking the chair previously occupied by the police officer.  
真嗣照做了，坐上了之前警察坐的那把椅子。

"I, uh..." He seemed to be having trouble meeting her eyes. "I'm sorry for uh, hitting you."  
“我，呃……”他似乎很难直视她的眼睛。“我为，呃，打了你而道歉。”

"That's not necessary." His eyes flew back to her face, still pretty despite the years. "It was my mistake."  
“那没必要。”他的目光又回到了她的脸上，尽管岁月流逝，她依然美丽。“那是我的错。”

Shinji still felt the need to apologize and Ritsuko sensed it.  
真嗣仍然觉得需要道歉，律子感觉到了。

"You haven't changed at all, have you?" she asked bluntly. "Forget about it, Shinji, the crash was my fault and I'm covering it. Or rather, my insurance will be," she added as an afterthought.  
“你一点都没变，是吧？”她直截了当地问。“别放在心上，真嗣，撞车是我的错，我会处理的。或者更确切地说，我的保险会负责，”她补充道，作为事后思考。

Shinji considered this and nodded. "How's your arm?"  
真嗣考虑了一下，点点头。“你的手臂怎么样了？”

Ritsuko waved it feebly. "Well, it's broken," she said, trying to make that sound as light as possible. "I've dealt with worse injuries before, though, so not much of a problem."  
律子无力地挥了挥手。“嗯，它坏了，”她尽量让语气听起来轻松些，“不过我以前处理过更严重的伤，所以问题不大。”

Shinji's face darkened and Ritsuko knew she had erred. Instead of making him feel better about the crash she had driven him to think of the past, of the injuries she had sustained while working at Nerv.  
真嗣的脸色阴沉下来，律子知道自己说错了话。她本想让他对这次事故感觉好些，却反而让他想起了过去，想起了她在 NERV 工作时受过的伤。

The loudening clicking of spike heels announced the arrival of the nurse long before she showed up in person.  
尖头高跟鞋的咔嗒声越来越响，护士还没现身，声音就先到了。

"That's quite enough," she said to Shinji. "Dr. Akagi, you'll have to fill out some forms, and then you'll be free to leave."  
"够了，"她对真嗣说。"赤木博士，您需要填写一些表格，然后就可以离开了。"

Flustered, Shinji stood up to leave. "I'm... I'm sorry."  
真嗣慌乱地站起来准备离开。"我……我很抱歉。"

"Shinji." Ritsuko's voice was firm. "Wait there." To the nurse, "Where are the forms?" She caught the clipboard and pen thrust roughly at her and scribbled her signature on each page. No one spoke as she got out of the bed and tossed the clipboard back to the nurse. "Let's go."  
"真嗣。"律子的声音坚定。"在那儿等着。"她转向护士，"表格在哪儿？"她接过粗鲁塞给她的夹板和笔，在每页上匆匆签下名字。没有人说话，她从床上下来，把夹板扔回给护士。"我们走吧。"

While Shinji, who was feeling lost and guilty, made it to the door without stumbling, Ritsuko took two steps and landed on the hard floor.  
尽管感到迷茫和内疚的 Shinji 顺利走到了门口没有绊倒，Ritsuko 却迈了两步就摔在了硬地板上。

"Uh, are you okay?" Shinji hurried back over.  
“呃，你还好吗？” Shinji 急忙赶了回来。

"I'm fine." She took his outstretched hand with her right and got back to her feet. "I guess I'm still a little dizzy from medication." The doctor glanced at the nurse behind her, who was now muttering feverishly as she inspected the forms. Apparently she had noticed nothing.  
“我没事。”她用右手握住他伸出的手，重新站了起来。“我想我还在药物作用下有点头晕。”医生瞥了一眼身后的护士，她正热切地低声自语，检查着手中的表格。显然她什么也没注意到。

"Let's go," she muttered again, keeping a shoulder on Shinji's shoulder for support. As they entered the elevators, she remembered something for the umpteenth time that day. She groaned and lowered her head as she spoke the words again.  
"走吧，"她再次低声说道，一只手搭在真嗣的肩膀上以作支撑。当他们进入电梯时，她那天不知第几次想起了某件事。她呻吟着低下头，再次说出了那句话。

"I have to go to work."  
"我得去上班了。"

Author's Notes: Sorry, this chapter is really rushed and messy since it's Sunday night and I haven't finished homework...anyway, a bit of what's going on for Ritsuko, and Shinji has finally entered the picture...there will be a lot more of him in the future, I promise.  
作者笔记：抱歉，这一章真的很仓促且杂乱，因为现在是周日晚上，我还没完成作业……总之，这里稍微交代了一下律子的状况，真嗣终于登场了……我保证，未来会有更多关于他的内容。

Drop me a review! Thanks so much!  
给我留个评论吧！非常感谢！

### Chapter 7: Back at Misato's  
第七章：回到美里家  

"Hello, Ritsuko." “你好，律子。”

The doctor stared in surprise at the young man who stood outside her door. Shinji Ikari was not dressed in the white shirt and black pants that he had always worn, shying away from everyone. Instead, he was dressed smartly in a suit and tie with shiny black shoes, carrying a leather computer bag in one hand. He looked her directly in the eyes as he spoke.  
医生惊讶地看着站在她门外的年轻人。碇真嗣没有像往常那样穿着白衬衫和黑裤子，躲避着所有人。相反，他穿着一身笔挺的西装，打着领带，脚踩闪亮的黑皮鞋，一手提着真皮电脑包。他直视着她的眼睛说话。

"Come in." She stepped aside and gestured to her cramped living room. "If you don't mind, I'll be a few more minutes. Misato will be here any minute."  
"请进。" 她侧身让开，示意她那狭小的客厅。"如果你不介意，我还需要几分钟。美里马上就到了。"

"All right." "好的。"

Ritsuko hurried back into her room and hurriedly packed. Misato had called the day of her car crash and invited her over for the weekend. The doctor had apologized and explained that she couldn't get there since her car was totaled.  
律子匆忙回到房间，急忙收拾行李。美里在她车祸当天打来电话，邀请她周末过去。医生道歉并解释说，由于她的车彻底报废了，她无法前往。

Misato had offered to come pick her up. Ritsuko thought this over, decided that Misato's driving skills had to have improved somewhat over the last decade, and agreed.  
美里提出要来接她。律子考虑了一下，认为美里的驾驶技术在过去十年里应该有所提高，于是同意了。

Ritsuko slung the bag over her shoulder and emerged a minute later. Shinji was sitting on one of her squashy armchairs, his bag leaning against the curved wooden leg. He was absorbed in his work, his fingers dancing over the keyboard of his laptop. Only when Ritsuko sat down in the seat next to him did he jump and quickly lay aside the laptop.  
律子把包甩到肩上，一分钟后走了出来。真嗣坐在她的一张软绵绵的扶手椅上，他的包靠在弯曲的木椅腿旁。他正专注于工作，手指在笔记本电脑的键盘上飞舞。直到律子坐在他旁边的座位上，他才吓了一跳，迅速把笔记本电脑放在一旁。

"I'm sorry," he apologized quickly.  
“对不起，”他迅速道歉道。

"That's fine." Ritsuko sat back and clasped her hands together over her knee. They hadn't talked since the day of the crash, and Ritsuko shivered in remembrance—not of the crash, but of her boss's reaction later.  
"那很好。" 律子向后靠了靠，双手交叠放在膝上。自从那次坠机事件后，她们就没再交谈过，律子回想起那一天，不由得打了个寒颤——不是因为坠机本身，而是她上司随后的反应。

"So, Shinji, what do you do now?"  
"那么，真嗣，你现在做什么呢？"

Shinji blinked and regained his confidence a moment later. "I'm working with Kensuke, actually," he began hesitantly. Then, more eagerly, "Kensuke never lost his love of taking photos. He's the main photographer for a new magazine in America, and I'm... I'm... well, the director of photography."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，片刻后恢复了自信。"其实，我和健介一起工作，"他有些迟疑地开始说道。接着，更加热情地说，"健介从未失去对摄影的热爱。他现在是美国一家新杂志的首席摄影师，而我...我...嗯，是摄影总监。"

"Interesting. But who is Kensuke?"  
“有意思。但谁是健介？”

A look of dawning spread over Shinji's face. He seized his laptop and began working enigmatically again, as Ritsuko watched. A moment later he whirled the computer around. The screen showed a smiling, freckled boy with slightly curly brown hair and round glasses.  
真嗣脸上露出了恍然大悟的表情。他抓起笔记本电脑，又开始神秘地操作起来，律子在一旁看着。片刻后，他将电脑转了过来。屏幕上显示着一个微笑着的、长着雀斑的男孩，略微卷曲的棕色头发，戴着圆框眼镜。

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow.  
律子挑了挑眉。

"He was my classmate...back then," Shinji finished, somewhat weakly.  
"他曾经是我的同学...那时候，" 真嗣有些无力地补充道。

Ritsuko nodded then. "I remember Misato mentioning him."  
律子点点头。"我记得美里提到过他。"

A long pause followed. 随后是一阵漫长的沉默。

"Uh, Ritsuko?" "呃，律子？"

"Yes?" “是？”

"Do Misato and Asuka know I'm coming?"  
"美里和明日香知道我要来吗？"

Ritsuko faltered. "I tried to call Misato last night and tell her of our change in plans, but only Asuka was home. She didn't know who I was, and I didn't want to tell her outright."  
律子犹豫了一下。“我昨晚试着给美里打电话，告诉她我们的计划有变，但只有明日香在家。她不知道我是谁，我也不想直接告诉她。”

After all, how could she not invite Shinji? And if Misato had changed as little as it appeared she had, another guest wouldn't make any difference. It was Asuka she was concerned about.  
毕竟，她怎能不邀请真嗣呢？而且如果美里看起来几乎没变，再多一位客人也不会有什么影响。她真正担心的是明日香。

"Will she still hate me?" Shinji asked in a small voice.  
“她还会恨我吗？”真嗣小声问道。

"No." The word escaped Ritsuko's lips immediately, but Shinji did not look convinced. "She's been through a lot—no one knows where she's been for the last twelve years—and from what Misato's told me, she's not the same person she was before. But Shinji, tread carefully around her, all right?"  
“不会。”这句话立刻从律子口中脱口而出，但真嗣看起来并不信服。“她经历了很多——没人知道她过去十二年去了哪里——而且据美里告诉我，她已经不是以前的那个人了。但真嗣，在她周围要小心，好吗？”

"I will." "我会的。"

Pause. 停顿。

Ritsuko looked at her watch. "Where is Misato?"  
律子看了看手表。“美里在哪里？”

= = = = = = =

The little children crowded around Asuka as they waved to Misato. The purple-haired woman waved back with a "peace" sign, backed out of her driveway, and promptly ran over her flowers. The children groaned.  
小孩子们围在明日香身边，向美里挥手。紫发的女子回以一个“和平”手势，倒出她的车道，却不小心碾过了花坛。孩子们发出一阵叹息。

Misato pulled her tires out of the soggy ground with a squelching sound and rolled down her window. "I'll be back this afternoon, Asuka."  
美里用一阵吱吱声将轮胎从泥泞中拔出，摇下车窗。“我下午就回来，明日香。”

"Drive carefully, Misato," Asuka implored. "You didn't get very much sleep last night."  
“开车小心点，美里，”明日香恳求道，“你昨晚没怎么睡。”

Misato laughed and shifted her gaze to the kids clustering around Asuka, much like goslings to their mother. "And you kids, be nice to Asuka."  
美里笑着，将目光转向围绕在明日香身边的小孩们，他们就像小鸭子跟着妈妈一样。“你们这些孩子，要对明日香好一点哦。”

"We will!" they chorused. Misato waved and drove off.  
“我们会的！”他们齐声回答。美里挥了挥手，开车离开了。

"Asuka-san." One of the older girls, about seven or eight, was tugging on her skirt. "Can we make a cake?"  
“明日香姐姐。”一个七八岁左右的大女孩拉着她的裙子。“我们可以做个蛋糕吗？”

"We saw Misato-san cooking really late last night," her brother added. "Will there be a big party when she comes back?"  
"我们昨晚看到美里小姐很晚还在做饭，"她的弟弟补充道，"她回来时会有盛大的派对吗？"

"Well, I'm not sure," Asuka responded hesitantly, but the persistent begging of the children soon won her over. "All right, let's get to work."  
"嗯，我不确定，"明日香犹豫地回答，但孩子们的恳求很快打动了她。"好吧，我们开始动手吧。"

With a loud cheer, everyone hurried into the kitchen, with Asuka following in the rear.  
大家欢呼一声，急忙冲进厨房，明日香跟在后面。

"Stop!" a feminine voice called, and immediately the chatter died down. The oldest of them all, a tall-dark-haired girl named Kimie, immediately took control. The boys who had been reaching for flour and sugar stopped in mid- motion, as did several of the younger children, who were noisily dragging a chair across the floor. "Nobody move until Asuka-san tells you what to do."  
"停下！"一个女声喊道，随即嘈杂声戛然而止。其中年纪最大的，一位高挑的黑发女孩名叫 Kimie，立刻掌控了局面。那些正伸手去拿面粉和糖的男孩们动作僵住了，几个拖着椅子横穿地板的小孩也停了下来。"在 Asuka 桑告诉你们该做什么之前，谁都不许动。"

It feels so strange to give orders—and even stranger to see them obeying, Asuka thought, as she directed the younger children to bring her bowls and measuring spoons while the older ones lifted the bags of sugar and flour up to the table. When all the ingredients and containers had been assembled, the children gathered around the square table. Asuka found a recipe and began to read it.  
发号施令的感觉很奇怪——看到他们服从更是如此，Asuka 心想，她指挥小孩子们去拿碗和量勺，而大一些的孩子则将糖和面粉袋搬到桌上。当所有食材和容器都准备妥当后，孩子们围坐在方桌旁。Asuka 找到一份食谱，开始阅读。

"Four cups of flour," she read, and handed the measuring cup to the child sitting nearest. "Miki, will you measure out four cups of flour and pour them in?"  
"四杯面粉，"她读道，并将量杯递给坐在最近的孩子。"Miki，你能量出四杯面粉并倒进去吗？"

Miki got up and cautiously obeyed. The third cup slid from her chubby hand, spilling its contents upon the table. Some of the older boys laughed, and Miki looked as if she were about to cry. Asuka stood up, automatically silencing them, and helped the little girl to pour the last two cups.  
美纪站起身，小心翼翼地服从了。第三杯从她胖乎乎的手中滑落，洒在了桌子上。一些大一点的男孩笑了起来，美纪看起来快要哭了。明日香站起来，自然而然地让他们安静下来，并帮助小女孩倒最后两杯。

It never occurred to Asuka how much faster the cake would have been completed, had she done it herself. She was having fun, helping the children read and measure out ingredients, slowly growing into her role as leader of the clan.  
明日香从未想过，如果她自己来做，蛋糕会完成得快多少。她正享受着乐趣，帮助孩子们阅读和测量配料，慢慢地适应她作为家族领袖的角色。

Several hours later the cake finally entered the oven, and Asuka sighed in relief. But before she could even turn around, Kimie yelled, "Makoto, what have you done to your pants?!"  
几个小时后，蛋糕终于进了烤箱，明日香松了一口气。但她还没来得及转身，君惠就大喊道：“真琴，你的裤子怎么了？！”

Makoto looked down and stood up. A shower of sugar fell to the floor.  
真琴低头站了起来。一阵糖雨洒落在地板上。

"I'll clean it up," Asuka volunteered. Several of the kids sighed in relief, and all appeared exhausted. "You can go home if you want. You must all be tired from getting up early to say goodbye to Misato-san."  
“我来清理吧，”明日香主动说道。几个孩子松了口气，所有人都显得疲惫不堪。“如果你们想回家，可以回去。你们一定都因为早起向美里小姐告别而累了。”

The boys stood up and ran out of the house, but several of the girls stopped to hug Asuka and thank her. When she had seen them all off safely, she returned with a wet rag—only to find that Kimie was already on her knees, scrubbing at the mess of sticky batter.  
男孩们站起来跑出了房子，但有几个女孩停下来拥抱明日香并感谢她。当她确保所有人都安全离开后，她拿着一块湿抹布回来——却发现君子已经跪在地上，用力擦洗着那团黏糊糊的面糊。

"Kimie, you don't have to do that," Asuka cried out, both touched and worried at the sight of the young girl cleaning. "It's only eight o'clock. Your parents must be worried about where you are."  
“希美，你不必这么做，”明日香喊道，既感动又担忧地看着小女孩在打扫。“现在才八点钟。你父母一定在担心你去哪儿了。”

"I don't have any," she shrugged. "I'm in charge of Keiichi and Makoto at home."  
“我没有父母，”她耸耸肩。“我在家里负责照顾圭一和诚。”

Asuka remembered the two brothers running off with the rest. "Will they all right on their own?"  
明日香想起那两兄弟和其他孩子一起跑开了。“他们自己能行吗？”

"They'll go home with someone else," Kimie assured her. Feeling that it would be useless to argue any more, Asuka got down on her knees and began cleaning up the spilled sugar.  
"她们会和别人回家的，" 纪惠安慰她说。觉得再争论也无济于事，明日香跪下来开始清理洒出来的糖。

"It must be a lot of work for you," Asuka commented quietly.  
"对你来说一定很辛苦吧，" 明日香轻声评论道。

Kimie shrugged. "I'm used to it. There's a lot of cooking and cleaning to do, and since there was only me to do it, I grew into it pretty quickly."  
纪惠耸了耸肩。"我习惯了。做饭和打扫的工作很多，而且只有我一个人做，所以很快就适应了。"

Asuka nodded and continued to clean, feeling her face grow hot. In a way she felt embarrassed—after all, Kimie was only a child, no more than eleven years old, and already she managed her entire family perfectly. She reminded Asuka of someone from the past—someone she knew had existed and wasn't simply a fragment of her imagination—but she could not recall either the girl's face nor her name. The redhead passed the next hour scrubbing and rinsing, lost in her own thoughts.  
明日香点点头，继续打扫，感觉自己的脸颊越来越热。在某种程度上她感到尴尬——毕竟，君子只是个孩子，不超过十一岁，却已经完美地管理着整个家庭。她让明日香想起了过去某个人——一个她知道确实存在而非仅仅是她想象片段的人——但她记不起那个女孩的脸或名字。红发女孩接下来的一个小时都在擦洗和冲洗，沉浸在自己的思绪中。

Later, when the girl was about to leave, she suddenly turned around and threw her arms around the redhead.  
后来，当女孩准备离开时，她突然转过身来，张开双臂抱住了红发女孩。

"I really like you, Asuka-san," she said, "and I hope you stay here forever."  
“我真的很喜欢你，明日香姐姐，”她说，“希望你能永远留在这里。”

= = = = = = =

That damn ring. 那该死的戒指。

Misato groaned and flapped her arm around wildly, trying unsuccessfully to shut it off. Finally she sat up and stretched—she had learned the hard way that sleeping in the driver's seat was not very comfortable. Vaguely she remembered pulling off the main road and turning off the engine in a deserted park.  
美里呻吟着，疯狂地挥舞着手臂，试图关掉它却未能成功。最终她坐起身来，伸了个懒腰——她已经吃过苦头，知道在驾驶座上睡觉并不舒服。隐约记得自己把车开离了主干道，在一个荒凉的公园里熄了火。

Her cell phone rang again. Misato picked it up and flipped it open with one hand, still resting her chin on the top of the steering wheel.  
她的手机再次响起。美里用一只手拿起手机，翻开盖子，下巴依旧靠在方向盘顶端。

"Misato? Is that you?" "美里？是你吗？"

Misato pulled herself up to sitting position and glanced at the clock above her car radio. It read 3:49.  
美里挣扎着坐起身，瞥了一眼她车载收音机上方的时钟。显示的是 3 点 49 分。

"Misato?" “美里？”

I should have been there three hours ago, Misato thought groggily. Damn.  
我本该三个小时前就到了，美里昏昏沉沉地想着。该死。

"I'm coming." "我来了。"

= = = = = = =

"I'm sorry," Misato said shamefully, several hours later.  
"对不起，"美里羞愧地说，几个小时后。"

"You ought to be," Ritsuko scolded. "Shinji's waiting for nearly five hours."  
"你该道歉，"律子责备道。"真嗣已经等了快五个小时了。"

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

As Misato watched in surprise, the taller, more mature son of Ikari Gendo stepped in front of the blonde. Ritsuko moved aside, enjoying Misato's shocked expression.  
当美里惊讶地看着时，碇源堂更为高大、成熟的儿子站到了金发女孩面前。律子退到一旁，欣赏着美里震惊的表情。

"Hello, Misato." “你好，美里。”

"Hello," Misato managed, and followed it up with, "Are you coming with us too?"  
“你好，”美里勉强回应，接着问道，“你也要和我们一起去吗？”

The younger, shier boy emerged from within the businessman. "Is that all right?"  
那个更年轻、害羞的男孩从商人身体里显现出来。“这样可以吗？”

"Of course." “当然可以。”

Ritsuko and Shinji got into the back of their car with their respective bags and Misato turned the key. She stamped her foot on the accelerator and the car jerked forward. Ritsuko crashed into the front seat and was thrown back a moment later when the car thudded to a stop at the stop sign. Shinji clutched one arm tightly around his precious laptop and threw out the other to keep Ritsuko from flying through the windshield.  
律子和真嗣各自带着行李坐进车后座，美里转动钥匙发动了汽车。她一脚踩下油门，车子猛地向前一冲。律子撞到了前排座椅，随即又被甩回座位，因为车子在停车标志前砰地一声停了下来。真嗣紧紧抱住他珍贵的笔记本电脑，伸出另一只手防止律子飞出挡风玻璃。

"Your driving skills haven't improved at all, I see," Ritsuko commented sourly.  
“看来你的驾驶技术一点都没进步啊。”律子酸溜溜地评论道。

Misato shrugged and stamped on the accelerator again. The car tipped precariously, balancing on the edge of its wheels as it rounded a corner. Misato twirled the wheel wildly and the car landed with a thump on all four wheels.  
美里耸了耸肩，再次猛踩油门。汽车在转弯时危险地倾斜，轮子边缘几乎悬空。美里疯狂地转动方向盘，车子砰的一声四轮着地。

Ritsuko sighed. 律子叹了口气。

= = = = = = =

She had watched the sun slide lazily overhead, then over to the other side of Misato's house, and now it was slowly sinking down over the treetops, casting a warm glow of orange down on the earth.  
她曾目睹太阳慵懒地划过米佐托家的上空，然后移至另一侧，如今它正缓缓沉入树梢，将一抹温暖的橙色光辉洒向大地。

Asuka sat on the front steps, her feet resting on the step below. Her legs were spread out slightly and her elbows were balanced on her knees, the base of her palms propping up her chin. Beside her, Kimie edged a bit closer and put her head on Asuka's upper arm. Neither of them spoke.  
明日香坐在前台阶上，双脚搁在下一级台阶。她的双腿微微张开，肘部撑在膝盖上，掌根托着下巴。身旁，纪美子稍稍挪近，将头靠在明日香的上臂。两人都沉默不语。

The cake was finished, iced neatly with some sweet concoction Kimie had brewed up. Together they had split a watermelon and decorated the top and sides with the reddest, frostiest centers of each slice. They had taken their time eating the rest of the slices, having competitions to see who could spit seeds farther. Asuka had taken great care to place the cake in the center of the dishes Misato had prepared, feeling as if she were a child Kimie's age.  
蛋糕已经完成，用纪美子调制的甜美糖霜整齐地涂抹。她们一起切开西瓜，用最红、最冰凉的中心部分装饰顶部和侧面。她们悠闲地吃着剩下的西瓜片，比赛看谁能把籽吐得更远。明日香小心翼翼地将蛋糕放在米佐托准备的盘子中央，感觉自己仿佛回到了纪美子那样的孩童时代。

At last there was nothing to do, and the two resigned to waiting idly.  
终于无事可做，两人只好无奈地闲等着。

Asuka was torn between wanting them to show up quickly and wanting them to stall a bit. She was a bit afraid of meeting Ritsuko; in the last month she had spoken to no one but Misato, Hazuki-san, and the children who came to eat watermelons. The very idea of meeting a stranger unnerved her. From Misato's descriptions, Ritsuko had seemed a very down-to-earth person. Asuka wondered if she would be strict, and hoped that she would make a good impression on the doctor.  
明日香内心矛盾，既希望他们快点出现，又希望他们能拖延一会儿。她对见律子有些害怕；过去一个月里，她只和美里、一之瀬小姐以及来吃西瓜的孩子们说过话。一想到要见陌生人就让她不安。从美里的描述中，律子似乎是个非常踏实的人。明日香想知道她会不会很严厉，并希望自己能在医生面前留下好印象。

Thinking of all this, she shivered slightly.  
想到这些，她微微颤抖了一下。

"Are you cold?" "你冷吗？"

"No," Asuka said quickly, but the younger girl immediately took over her small jacket and draped it over Asuka's shoulders.  
"不冷，" 明日香迅速回答，但小女孩立刻接过她的小外套，披在了明日香的肩上。

I should be the one playing her mother, Asuka thought, touched. Instead she's the one taking care of me.  
我本该扮演她的母亲，明日香感动地想，现在却是她在照顾我。

She extended an arm and took Kimie into her embrace.  
她伸出手臂，将君子拥入怀中。

"Will your brothers be all right without you for so long?"  
“你哥哥们这么久没有你会没事吗？”

Kimie nodded, clearly as content as could be. Asuka let her rest in silence until some thirty minutes later, when the faint hum of an engine grew louder and louder until the old blue car came into sight.  
君子点点头，显然心满意足。明日香让她安静地休息，直到大约三十分钟后，一阵微弱的引擎声逐渐变大，直到那辆旧蓝车出现在视线中。

"Misato-san, watch for the—!" Kimie cried, holding up a hand, but to no avail; Misato drove headlong into a small tree and cursed as she backed up. A shower of leaves sprinkled down over her windshield, and she turned on the wipers in an attempt to get rid of them. The back door opened and Ritsuko, apparently having had enough, stepped out of the still-moving car.  
"美里小姐，小心前面——！" 君子喊道，举起手来，但无济于事；美里一头撞上了一棵小树，边倒车边咒骂。树叶如雨般洒落在她的挡风玻璃上，她打开雨刷试图清除它们。后门打开，显然已经受够了，律子从仍在移动的车上走了下来。

"Dr. Akagi." Asuka sprang up and ran over to her, bowing slightly. Ritsuko took her by the shoulder and brought her back up to a standing position.  
"赤木博士。" 明日香跳起来跑向她，微微鞠躬。律子抓住她的肩膀，将她扶正站好。

"There's no need for that." She studied the redhead, who was staring, perplexed. "You're still very pretty, Asuka. You don't look like you've changed that much since—"  
"不必如此。" 她打量着红发女孩，后者正困惑地盯着她。"你依然很漂亮，明日香。看起来你并没有改变太多，自从——"

"I hope you weren't worried?" asked Misato, stepping out to join Ritsuko. "Sorry, I fell asleep along the way..."  
"希望你没担心吧？" 美里走出来说道，加入了律子。"抱歉，我半路上睡着了……"

But Asuka was already tuning out Misato's voice and looking at the third occupant of the car. The former pilot of Eva-01 was climbing out of the cramped backseat, narrowly avoiding hitting his head on the roof. He glanced up and his dark eyes met Asuka's sapphire ones.  
但明日香已经不再听美里说话，而是看向车内的第三个人。前 Eva-01 驾驶员正从狭窄的后座爬出来，险些撞到车顶。他抬头一看，深邃的眼睛与明日香蓝宝石般的双眸相遇。

"...Shinji?" "……真嗣？"

Author's Notes: I apologize for the lateness of this chapter—there will be quite a bit of Shinji in the next chapter for all you Shinji fans. I'm sure you all can guess who Kimie is based on : )  
作者的话：对于这一章的延迟发布，我深感抱歉——下一章将会有很多真嗣的戏份，真嗣的粉丝们敬请期待。相信大家都能猜到 Kimie 是以谁为原型的：）

Hmm...nobody seems to know the anime that Hazuki-san's name came from. Here's a hint: It's about a girl with throat cancer who wants to be a singer. (I'll reveal the name next time.)  
嗯...似乎没有人知道 Hazuki-san 的名字出自哪部动漫。这里有个提示：这是一部关于一个患有喉癌却梦想成为歌手的女孩的故事。（下次我会揭晓名字。）

Thanks for reading and again, drop me a review!  
感谢阅读，再次欢迎留下您的评论！

### Chapter 8: Discussions
Dinner was a somewhat strained affair for the two twenty-six year olds who hadn't met in over twelve years, but Misato and Ritsuko made themselves at home. Shinji was seated to Asuka's left, and Misato to her right. Ritsuko sat directly facing her. Kimie, the dutiful and understanding girl that she was, politely excused herself and went home to take care of her brothers.  
对于已经十二年未见的两位二十六岁的人来说，晚餐有些拘谨，但美里和律子却很自在。真嗣坐在明日香的左边，美里坐在她的右边。律子直接坐在她的对面。身为尽责且善解人意的女孩，君子礼貌地告退，回家照顾她的弟弟们。

The table was laden with the products of Misato's long hours spent huddled over the stove. Immediately Shinji reached forward with his chopsticks, apparently hungry after the long ride, but Ritsuko hesitated before plucking up a piece of chicken. Misato watched her over the rim of her cup as she sipped, hoping that her cooking had improved somewhat over the years. Perhaps she should have measured before putting in the soy sauce.  
桌上摆满了美里长时间在炉灶前忙碌的成果。真嗣立刻伸出筷子，显然在长途骑行后饿了，但律子在夹起一块鸡肉前犹豫了一下。美里透过杯沿看着她，一边小口啜饮，希望自己的厨艺这些年有所进步。也许她应该在加酱油之前先量一下。

But Ritsuko nodded thoughtfully. "It's good." Shinji murmured in agreement.  
但律子若有所思地点了点头。“很好。”真嗣低声表示同意。

Asuka said nothing. She felt her face flame within the frame of her red hair. She had been preparing for hours to meet Ritsuko, but Shinji had caught her off guard. There was no way she could have been ready to meet a guy her age, much less one she had mercilessly teased and called "baka" countless times in the past. Yet—Asuka stole a glance at his face—he hadn't shown any signs of apathy nor aversion to her. Slightly ashamed now, she ducked her head down again and wondered why Shinji had chosen to forgive her. She remembered the hurting after she had been subjected to the same treatment and the state it had left her in.  
明日香一言不发。她感到自己的脸在红发间发烫。她为见律子准备了几个小时，但真嗣的出现让她措手不及。她怎么可能准备好去见一个同龄的男生，更别提是一个她过去无数次无情戏弄并称之为“笨蛋”的人。然而——明日香偷偷瞥了一眼他的脸——他并没有表现出任何冷漠或厌恶。现在略感羞愧，她再次低下头，想知道为什么真嗣会选择原谅她。她记得自己遭受同样对待后的痛苦，以及那给她留下的状态。

What?

Her thoughts were interrupted abruptly as Ritsuko put down her chopsticks in an attempt to draw the redhead into the conversation. "Asuka, how do you like living with Misato?"  
她的思绪被律子放下筷子的举动突然打断，试图将红发少女引入对话。“明日香，你喜欢和美里一起生活吗？”

"It's nice." When Ritsuko continued to look at her, however, Asuka was compelled to elaborate. "Oftentimes we sit outside and pick watermelons with the children that live around here."  
"挺不错的。" 但当律子继续看着她时，明日香不得不进一步解释道，"我们经常坐在外面，和住在这附近的小孩子们一起挑西瓜。"

"Was the girl who was with you earlier one of them?"  
"刚才和你在一起的那个女孩也是其中之一吗？"

"Yes," Asuka replied, a little too quickly, then turned back to her chicken.  
"是的，" 明日香回答得有点太快了，然后转回她的鸡肉。"

Ritsuko propped her chin up on her crossed fingers, her elbows resting on the table as she glanced out the window. "Do you remember the time, Misato, when you and I and—"  
律子用交叉的手指撑着下巴，双肘搁在桌上，目光瞥向窗外。“美里，你还记得那次吗，你和我还有——”

Misato suddenly choked on her tea and coughed. She quickly excused herself and hurried off. Ritsuko's sentence was left hanging in the air.  
美里突然被茶水呛到，猛地咳嗽起来。她迅速告退，匆匆离开。律子的话就这样悬在了空中。

"You and Misato and who?" Asuka asked, always craving more information.  
“你和美里还有谁？”明日香问，总是渴望更多信息。

Ritsuko and Shinji exchanged a look that Asuka did not understand.  
律子和真嗣交换了一个明日香无法理解的目光。

"Kaji Ryoji," Ritsuko said at last. "This used to be his house, and his watermelons."  
“加持良治，”律子终于说道，“这里曾经是他的房子，还有他的西瓜。”

Seeing the surprise on Asuka's face, she continued. "You don't know about him?"  
看到明日香脸上的惊讶，她继续说：“你不了解他吗？”

Asuka shook her head. "Who was—"  
明日香摇了摇头。“是谁——”

But at that moment Misato interrupted the conversation again as she returned, all smiles now. "Shinji-kun, it looks like you've become quite a businessman."  
但就在这时，美里再次打断了对话，她回来了，满脸笑容。“真嗣君，看来你已经成为一个相当成功的商人了。”

"I guess so." He smiled sheepishly. "I'm working with Aida Kensuke on a nature magazine in America. If you'd like, I can show you some of his work after dinner."  
“我想是的。”他腼腆地笑了笑。“我和相田剑介在美国合作创办了一本自然杂志。如果你愿意，晚饭后我可以给你看看他的作品。”

"That would be nice." Misato drank again. Anything to steer the conversation away from dangerous waters.  
“那会很好。”美里又喝了一口。任何能将对话从危险水域引开的话题都行。

Ritsuko watched her out of the corner of her eye. How odd it is, she thought, that it's Asuka who wants to know everything about the past, and Misato who is still trying to repress it. She picked up her own cup of tea and drank.  
律子用眼角余光观察着她。真奇怪，她想，是明日香想要了解过去的所有，而美里却仍在试图压抑它。她拿起自己的茶杯，喝了一口。

Meanwhile, Shinji reached out with his chopsticks for another piece of celery, just as Asuka reached for her glass of water. The backs of their hands collided and caused the water in Asuka's glass to spill all over her dress.  
与此同时，真嗣伸出筷子去夹另一片芹菜，恰好明日香伸手去拿水杯。他们的手背相撞，导致明日香杯中的水洒在了她的裙子上。

Both Misato and Ritsuko reached for a napkin as Asuka leapt up, but it was Shinji who managed to hand her a clean napkin first. Their fingers brushed again as she took it with a soft "thanks", and attempted unsuccessfully to dry it off.  
Misato 和 Ritsuko 都伸手去拿纸巾，但却是 Shinji 抢先递给 Asuka 一张干净的纸巾。她的手指再次轻轻触碰，她柔声道了句“谢谢”，却未能成功将水渍擦干。

"Why don't you go get another dress?" Misato suggested. Asuka excused herself and went upstairs to do so. Shinji, in his fancy business suit and leather shoes, got down on his hands and knees and proceeded to wipe up the rest of the water on the floor. Misato stuck her head under the table. "Shinji-kun, you really don't have to do that."  
“为什么不再去换件裙子呢？”Misato 建议道。Asuka 告辞后上楼去换衣服。Shinji 穿着笔挺的商务西装和皮鞋，跪在地上开始擦拭地板上剩余的水迹。Misato 探头到桌子底下，“Shinji 君，你真的不必这么做。”

Shinji shook his head and continued to scrub until Asuka returned, at which point he faced her embarrassedly. "I'm sorry."  
Shinji 摇了摇头，继续擦洗，直到 Asuka 回来，他才尴尬地面对她。“对不起。”

"It's all right," she assured him quickly.  
"没事的，" 她迅速安慰他。

The rest of dinner followed with the cake and a slideshow of Kensuke's pictures. The curly-haired boy who was once jealous of not being an Eva pilot had made himself quite a name in the Western Hemisphere, shooting images of rainforests, exotic wildlife, and even some underwater creatures. When Shinji at last shut down his computer, Ritsuko looked directly at Asuka and suggested, "Why don't we all go outside for a watermelon?"  
晚餐的其余部分继续进行，有蛋糕和一张 Kenji 的照片幻灯片。曾经因为不是 Eva 驾驶员而嫉妒的卷发男孩，在西方世界为自己赢得了不小的名声，拍摄了雨林、珍奇野生动物，甚至还有一些水下生物的照片。当 Shinji 最终关闭电脑时，Ritsuko 直视着 Asuka，提议道："我们为什么不都出去吃西瓜呢？"

"I'll go get the knife." Misato disappeared into the kitchen.  
"我去拿刀。" Misato 消失在厨房里。

As Asuka stood up, she slipped on the still-damp floor and flailed her arms wildly. Shinji grabbed one of them in an attempt to hold her up, then drew back when she pulled away, both embarrassed.  
当明日香站起来时，她在仍然湿漉漉的地板上滑了一跤，疯狂地挥舞着双臂。真嗣抓住她的一只手臂试图扶住她，但当她挣脱时，他退缩了，两人都感到尴尬。

"I'm sorry," he said. Again Asuka forgave him, though her face was pink.  
“对不起，”他说。明日香再次原谅了他，尽管她的脸颊泛起了红晕。

There are so many Asukas, the redhead thought, as Misato opened the back door and she stepped barefoot onto the cool, damp soil. Hazuki-san treated me like a patient. Misato treats me as an equal. Ritsuko looks at me as if I'm a little girl. Shinji...seems to act as if I'm a porcelain doll.  
有那么多个明日香，红发的她心想，当美里打开后门，她赤脚踩在凉爽湿润的泥土上。薰小姐把我当病人对待。美里把我视为平等。律子看我就像看一个小女孩。真嗣...似乎把我当作一个瓷娃娃。

And someone in the past treated me like none of these.  
而过去有人待我如无物。

Determined to enjoy the moment and not make a fool of herself in front of Ritsuko and Shinji, Asuka selected a watermelon and seated herself on it. Hesitantly Shinji chose the watermelon next to her. Ritsuko was about to sit down on a large, ripe watermelon when Misato grabbed it away and slapped it heartily.  
决心享受这一刻，不在赤木律子和真嗣面前出丑，明日香挑选了一个西瓜坐下。真嗣犹豫了一下，选择了她旁边的西瓜。赤木律子正要坐在一个又大又熟的西瓜上，美里却一把抢了过去，用力拍了拍。

"We'll cut this one," she decided, as Ritsuko set off in search of another watermelon to sit on.  
“我们来切这个，”她决定道，而赤木律子则去寻找另一个可以坐的西瓜。

As Misato cut and distributed slices, Asuka glanced over her shoulder and saw several of the young children—including Makoto, hanging on branches of trees in order to peer over the fence. Even as she watched, Kimie climbed deftly to the top, grabbed her brother by the back of his shirt, and dragged him down despite his howls.  
当美里切分并分发着切片时，明日香回头瞥了一眼，看到几个小孩子——包括挂在树枝上试图越过栅栏窥视的真琴。就在她注视之际，君子灵巧地爬到顶端，抓住弟弟的衬衫后背，不顾他的嚎叫将他拽了下来。

Without a glance in that direction, Misato spit out a seed and smoothly asked, "Ritsuko, Shinji, how long will you be able to stay?"  
美里没有朝那个方向看一眼，吐出一颗籽，流畅地问道：“律子，真嗣，你们能待多久？”

"I'll have to return by the day after tomorrow," Ritsuko said thoughtfully, and then added under her breath, "or I'll be out of a job."  
“我后天就得回去，”律子若有所思地说，然后低声补充道，“否则就要失业了。”

Ignoring the second half of Ritsuko's sentence, "Shinji-kun?"  
无视了律子后半句话，“真嗣君？”

"Uh, I've actually got two weeks of vacation left," Shinji admitted shyly. "But—"  
“呃，我其实还有两周的假期，”真嗣羞涩地承认道，“但是——”

"Are you thinking of visiting anywhere else?"  
“你还在考虑去别的地方吗？”

"Not really," Shinji confessed. "I'd like to stop by my mother's grave, but that's all."  
"不是真的，" 真嗣坦白道。"我想去看看我母亲的墓，仅此而已。"

"Then it's settled, you'll be staying here," Misato closed the matter by spitting out a few more seeds. "And Ritsuko, I'll drive you back to Kyoto Monday afternoon."  
"那就这么定了，你留在这里，" 美里吐出几颗种子，把事情定了下来。"还有律子，我周一中午开车送你回京都。"

Ritsuko closed her eyes as she imagined another four hours in the backseat—with Misato at the wheel. As if reading her thoughts, Misato laughed and reminded her, "You can't complain about my driving. I haven't hit anyone."  
律子闭上眼睛，想象着在后排再坐四个小时——由美里开车。仿佛读懂了她的心思，美里笑了，提醒她："你不能抱怨我的驾驶技术。我还没撞到过任何人。"

Ritsuko snorted. Misato stood up. "I'll go put the knife back."  
律子哼了一声。美里站起身来。“我去把刀放回去。”

"I'll help you clean up," Ritsuko offered. Shinji quickly stood up too, but Misato pushed him back down roughly. "You've already cleaned the floor." The two ladies disappeared into the house, leaving Asuka and Shinji alone outside.  
“我来帮你收拾，”律子提议道。真嗣也迅速站了起来，但美里粗鲁地把他推了回去。“你已经把地板擦干净了。”两位女士消失在屋内，留下明日香和真嗣独自在外面。

The loose strands of Asuka's copper hair fluttered in the gentle breeze. She looked away from Shinji determinedly, not sure what she could say to him.  
明日香那铜色的发丝在微风中轻轻飘动。她坚决地移开了视线，不知道该对他说些什么。

"Asuka." She turned to face him slowly, and saw that he was smiling. He looked off into the distance, his hands on one knee. "I never thought we'd meet up here. In a watermelon patch." As Asuka laughed softly, his expression grew serious. "Asuka, I understand that you may not want to talk about it, but what happened to you over the last few years?"  
"明日香。" 她缓缓转身面对他，看到他在微笑。他目光投向远方，双手放在一个膝盖上。"我从没想过我们会在这种地方相遇。在西瓜地里。" 明日香轻声笑了起来，他的表情变得严肃。"明日香，我知道你可能不想谈这个，但过去几年你经历了什么？"

As soon as the words escaped his lips, Shinji had to suppress a groan. That was a terrible way to put it. But Asuka didn't even flinch, although she seemed to be thinking deeply.  
话一出口，真嗣就忍不住要呻吟一声。这话说得太糟糕了。但明日香连眼都没眨一下，尽管她似乎在深思。

"I don't know," she said at last. "I remember bits and pieces about Eva, and a little bit about you and Rei. But—" she swallowed hard— "I don't know who, or why it happened, but I can remember someone else. Someone towering over me—calling me names—hitting me—"  
"我不知道，" 她终于说道。"我记得关于 EVA 的一些片段，还有关于你和绫波的一些事情。但是——" 她艰难地咽了口唾沫—— "我不知道是谁，也不知道为什么会发生，但我记得有另一个人。一个高大的身影——对我恶语相向——打我——"

Her voice shook and died. She buried her face in her hands. Shinji inched closer, but she slid away as far as her watermelon would allow. With nothing else left for him to do, Shinji changed the topic.  
她的声音颤抖着消失了。她将脸埋在双手中。真嗣缓缓靠近，但她尽可能地滑开，直到西瓜的边缘。真嗣无计可施，只好转换话题。

"When we drove up, that girl was hugging you. Tell me more about her," he coaxed.  
“我们开车过来时，那个女孩在拥抱你。多告诉我一些关于她的事，”他哄劝道。

Asuka's blue eyes emerged from under her forearms and pivoted to face him. "Her name's Kimie," she said quietly, "She leads the children who come to eat watermelons. She has two younger brothers, and no parents. She reminds me of someone, but I don't know who."  
明日香的蓝眼睛从她的前臂下露出来，转向他。“她叫君子，”她轻声说，“她带领那些来吃西瓜的孩子们。她有两个弟弟，没有父母。她让我想起某个人，但我不知道是谁。”

She wanted to fall to pieces after hearing her own words. Nothing had ever sounded so stupid. She half-expected Shinji to burst out into laughter, and braced herself for it. Instead there was silence.  
听到自己的话后，她真想崩溃成碎片。从未有过如此愚蠢的声音。她半期待着真嗣爆发出笑声，并为此做好了准备。然而，回应她的只有沉默。

When Shinji spoke again, he said, "I know the girl you're thinking of."  
当真嗣再次开口时，他说：“我知道你心里想的那个人。”

Asuka looked at him curiously. "Who?"  
明日香好奇地看着他。“谁？”

"Does the name Hikari Horaki sound familiar?"  
"光莉·堀木这个名字听起来熟悉吗？"

"No."

"Oh."

"Tell me," Asuka begged, and rotated on her watermelon so that she was facing him.  
"告诉我，"明日香恳求道，扭动着坐在西瓜上的身体，面向他。"

"She was your best friend, back then," Shinji began awkwardly, "and our class representative. She had three sisters at home and no parents either, so she took care of everything."  
"她那时是你最好的朋友，"真嗣尴尬地开始说道，"也是我们班的班长。她家里有三个妹妹，也没有父母，所以她负责打理一切。"

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Yes?" “是？”

How weird it felt to say his name out loud, Asuka thought, but she was focused on her next question. Yes, Kimie might be a younger version of Hikari, but she couldn't even remember what the class representative had looked like—and there was a more pressing isuse on her mind.  
说出他的名字感觉很奇怪，明日香心想，但她专注于下一个问题。是的，也许希美是比卡莉的年轻版本，但她甚至记不清班代表长什么样——而且她心中有一个更紧迫的问题。

"Was Eva really that bad?"  
“Eva 真的那么糟糕吗？”

Shinji sucked in a breath as he remembered. "We saved people," he admitted at last. "And we killed people. It was very traumatic at times."  
真嗣深吸一口气，回忆道：“我们救了人，”他最终承认，“我们也杀了人。那段时间非常痛苦。”

"I remember Misato said that Toji Suzuhara died in an accident concerning the Evas. What happened?"  
"我记得美里说过，铃原东治是在与 EVA 有关的事故中丧生的。到底发生了什么？"

Is she ready for the truth?  
她准备好面对真相了吗？

"My Eva destroyed him," Shinji said finally, in a voice overflowing with guilt and sorrow. "His Eva was infected with the thirteenth angel and we had no choice but to destroy it."  
"是我的 EVA 摧毁了他，" 真嗣终于说道，声音中充满了愧疚和悲伤。"他的 EVA 被第十三使徒感染了，我们别无选择，只能将其摧毁。"

"Angel," Asuka repeated slowly.  
"天使," 明日香缓缓重复道。

Shinji shifted the topic. "What do you remember about Eva?"  
真嗣转移了话题。"你对 Eva 还有哪些记忆？"

It came in bits and pieces. "I remember that my Eva was red, and my suit was red to go with it. It was filled with something called LCL..." She drifted off into a private corner of her memory, thinking carefully. "Something called a 'synchronization rate'. Misato and Ritsuko were always there, and they told us what to do. Did we go underwater with it once?"  
记忆零零碎碎地浮现。"我记得我的 Eva 是红色的，我的驾驶服也是红色的，与之相配。里面充满了某种叫做 LCL 的东西……"她陷入记忆的某个角落，仔细思索。"还有个叫'同步率'的东西。美里和律子总是在那里，告诉我们该做什么。我们是不是有一次和它一起潜入水下？"

She remembers that? Does she remember beating me over the head too?  
她还记得吗？她还记得当时把我打得头破血流吗？

"Yes, we did," Shinji said. "What else do you remember about that time?"  
“是的，我们确实那样做了，”真嗣说，“关于那段时间，你还记得些什么？”

Asuka shook her head. Nothing more.  
明日香摇了摇头。没有更多了。

When Shinji finished telling her the whole story, Asuka looked astounded.  
当真嗣讲完整个故事时，明日香看起来震惊不已。

"It seems like a story out of a book," she whispered. Her fingers played absentmindedly with the rough pigtail-like stem of her watermelon. "I can't imagine controlling such a thing. I can't imagine defeating an—Angel—like that."  
“这听起来像是书里的故事，”她低声说道。她的手指心不在焉地摆弄着西瓜上粗糙的辫子状茎。“我无法想象控制那样一个东西。我无法想象像那样击败一个——使徒——。”

"It is hard to imagine now," Shinji agreed. "But Asuka, you liked it. You were a wonderful pilot and you were proud of it."  
“现在确实难以想象，”真嗣同意道。“但明日香，你喜欢它。你曾是一位出色的驾驶员，并为此感到自豪。”

"Really?" “真的吗？”

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点点头。

"How did you feel about piloting Eva?"  
“驾驶 Eva 的感受如何？”

"I didn't like it at all." At Asuka's questioning glance, he continued, albeit a bit reluctantly. "I piloted Eva 01 almost solely to hear those rare words of praise from my father. He didn't care for me," Shinji said quietly, his gaze dropping to the field of watermelons. "He hardly ever spoke to me. It was Rei who was important."  
"我一点儿也不喜欢那样。" 在明日香疑惑的目光下，他继续说道，虽然有些不情愿。"我驾驶 Eva 01 几乎只是为了听到父亲那难得的赞扬。他不在乎我，" 真嗣轻声说道，目光落在了西瓜田上。"他很少和我说话。重要的是绫波。"

"What about your mother?"  
"那你母亲呢？"

"She died," Shinji said shortly, then revised his statement. "Well, I guess she didn't exactly die. As it's been put, 'a freak accident' erased her from this world—in short, she disappeared during testing with the Evas. There was no body."  
"她去世了，" 真嗣简短地回答，然后修正了自己的说法。"嗯，我想她并没有真正死去。正如人们所说，'一场意外事故'让她从这个世界上消失了——简而言之，她在 Eva 的测试中消失了。没有遗体。"

"I'm sorry," Asuka said. “对不起，”明日香说道。

"Don't be." Shinji smiled. "Things were bad then. They've improved since then."  
“别这么说。”真嗣微笑着。“那时候情况很糟。现在好多了。”

There was a long pause as Asuka recalled what Misato had told her of Ikari Gendo, one of the few people of Nerv who had had more power than she. Slowly she thought of the terrifying being called Eva, and the people that had suffered at it. Toji Suzuhara had died. Shinji's mother had disappeared without a trace. Why did Ikari Gendo put his wife and son in such danger? A shiver crept up her spine to think that she had been in that danger constantly, too.  
长时间的沉默中，明日香回想起美里告诉她的关于碇源堂的事情，他是 NERV 中少数比她更有权力的人之一。她慢慢地想起了那个被称为 EVA 的可怕存在，以及那些在它手中受苦的人们。铃原东治已经死去。真嗣的母亲消失得无影无踪。为什么碇源堂要把他的妻子和儿子置于这样的危险之中？一想到自己也一直处于那种危险之中，她不禁打了个寒颤。

"Shinji?" Asuka said again. The name escaped her lips as barely a wisp of a sound. This time she was almost afraid to hear the answer to her question.  
"真嗣？" 明日香再次说道。这个名字几乎只是微弱地从她唇间飘出。这一次，她几乎害怕听到问题的答案。

"Yes?" “是？”

"What do you know about my parents?"  
"你知道我父母的事吗？"

Shinji thought hard. "Nothing," he said at last. "Nothing at all."  
真嗣努力思考。"一无所知，" 他最终说道。"什么也不知道。

Asuka nodded. "I see." 明日香点点头。“我明白了。”

= = = = = = =

Shrouded in the darkness, Misato and Ritsuko sat cross-legged in front of the window, watching the two silhouettes outside.  
在黑暗的笼罩下，美里和律子盘腿坐在窗前，注视着外面的两个身影。

"You're still hiding," Ritsuko commented quietly. Misato did not deny it or swing her arm back to hit the doctor, but simply sighed.  
“你还在躲藏，”律子轻声评论道。美里既没有否认，也没有挥臂回击医生，只是叹了口气。

"I am," she admitted. "After Nerv disintegrated and I came here to live alone, I thought I could be happy with watermelons and neighborhood kids. With Asuka's arrival, however, everything's changed. She wants to know everything about the past, and I want to suppress it." There was a long pause. "I wonder what Kaji would have said if he were here."  
"是的，"她承认道。"在 NERV 解体后，我来到这里独自生活，以为可以和西瓜、邻家孩子们一起快乐。然而，随着明日香的到来，一切都变了。她想知道过去的所有事情，而我却想压抑它。"长时间的沉默后，她说道："我在想，如果加持在这里，他会说什么。"

There was a pause in which both women thought of him. Then Misato sniffled and Ritsuko laid her arm around her shoulder.  
两人都因想起他而陷入沉默。随后，美里吸了吸鼻子，律子则将手臂搭在她的肩上。

"It's all right," she whispered comfortingly. Misato nodded.  
"没事的，"她轻声安慰道。美里点了点头。

"You know," she said, pulling her head away and wiping at her eyes, "Asuka keeps asking what happened to Rei."  
"你知道吗，" 她把头移开，擦了擦眼睛，"明日香一直在问丽发生了什么事。"

"Well, I really don't know," Ritsuko said honestly. "After Nerv disintegrated she was left in Commander Ikari's charge. I don't know why, seeing as there was no use for her anymore."  
"嗯，我真的不知道，" 律子诚实地回答，"在 NERV 解散后，她被交由碇司令照顾。我不明白为什么，毕竟她已经没有用处了。"

Silence again, as they contemplated what might have become of the blue- haired, shy pilot of Eva Unit 00.  
又是一阵沉默，她们都在思考那位蓝发、害羞的零号机驾驶员可能的遭遇。

"It's getting late," Misato said, ending the conversation. "I'll go get Shinji and Asuka. We'll come up with a makeshift bed in our room for you, and Shinji can sleep on the couch."  
"天色已晚，" 美里结束了对话，"我去接真嗣和明日香。我们会在房间里给你搭个临时床铺，真嗣可以睡在沙发上。"

"All right." "好的。"

Ritsuko remained sitting on the floor, looking out the window. The tall, slender silhouette of Misato Katsuragi picked itself up and made its way out the door.  
律子依旧坐在地板上，望着窗外。高挑纤细的美里身影站起身，走出了房门。

Author's Notes: Yes, the anime from which I got Hazuki-san's name is Full Moon wo Sagashite—she's the deceased mother of the singer Koyama Mitsuki. Congratulations to all the people that answered correctly (ShadowScythe, sonlee16, jennyjennai, and Dsojourn)! I guess I should add in another disclaimer... I don't own Full Moon wo Sagashite either.  
作者笔记：没错，我取材自《寻找满月》这部动漫中的叶月 san——她是歌手小山满月的已故母亲。恭喜所有答对的人（ShadowScythe、sonlee16、jennyjennai 和 Dsojourn）！我想我应该再加一个声明...《寻找满月》我也没有版权。

And lastly, I'm sorry about that horrible cliffhanger last time. I promise I'll try to avoid such things in the future!  
最后，对于上次的可怕悬念，我深感抱歉。我保证以后会尽量避免这种情况！

### Chapter 9: Downfall
第九章：陨落

Over ten years had passed since he'd been here.  
自从他上次来这里，已经过去了十多年。

It had never been somewhere Shinji liked to be before, for he was never allowed to be alone. During the earlier years of his life the teacher had always accompanied him, making shifty gestures that clearly showed that he was uncomfortable. Throughout the years at Nerv he had visited his mother's grave every now and then—with his father. The thought of his father sent a surge of both annoyance and regret down his spine. Shinji pushed those thoughts out of his mind and concentrated on the few happy times of his childhood.  
真嗣以前并不喜欢来这个地方，因为他从未被允许独自一人。在他早年的生活中，老师总是陪伴着他，做出一些明显表现出不安的狡猾手势。在 NERV 的这些年里，他偶尔会和父亲一起拜访母亲的墓地。想到父亲，他脊背上涌起一阵恼怒和悔恨。真嗣将这些思绪抛诸脑后，专注于童年为数不多的快乐时光。

As brilliant a scientist as Yui Ikari had been, she had loved wildlife and nature as well. He had seen pictures of her hiking up mountains with his father before they were married. When he was old enough to understand, Yui had often taken him into the nearby woods and showed him deer, squirrels, and birds.  
正如碇唯是一位杰出的科学家一样，她也深爱着野生动植物和自然。在他父亲结婚前，他曾见过她与父亲一起登山远足的照片。当他长大到能够理解时，碇唯经常带他去附近的森林，让他认识鹿、松鼠和鸟类。

How dreadfully he'd missed those days after she died.  
在她去世后，那些日子他多么怀念啊。

Disappeared, not died, he corrected himself. She was part of Eva Unit 01, but regrettably, an Eva was not a suitable substitute for a mother.  
不是去世，而是消失了，他纠正自己。她成为了 EVA 初号机的一部分，但遗憾的是，EVA 并不能替代母亲的角色。

Shinji knelt down in front of the tombstone and placed a bouquet of crimson blossoms in front of it, feeling the cold seep through the thin fabric to his knees.  
真嗣跪在墓碑前，将一束深红色的花朵放在上面，感觉寒冷透过薄薄的布料渗入膝盖。

How different life would have been, had she lived, Shinji reflected. How often he had thought that as a child.  
如果她还活着，生活会有多么不同，真嗣沉思着。小时候他常常这样想。

But he had made himself a place and a name in the world, and the once cautious and shy pilot of Evangelion Unit 01 had to admit that he was perfectly happy crawling through swamps with his old friend Kensuke Aida, snapping pictures of whatever came into sight. He'd met with many rich and educated photographers and writers in America, and long ago ceased to feel himself inferior to them. His colleagues at work treated him with respect. Shinji Ikari was no longer the weak boy constantly beat and bossed about by a certain redheaded roommate.  
但他已经在世界上找到了自己的位置和名声，曾经谨慎而害羞的福音战士 01 号驾驶员不得不承认，他非常享受和老朋友相田剑介一起在沼泽中爬行，捕捉任何进入视野的东西。他在美国遇到了许多富有且受过良好教育的摄影师和作家，早已不再觉得自己比他们低人一等。工作中的同事们对他都十分尊重。碇真嗣不再是那个经常被某个红发室友欺负和指挥的软弱男孩了。

Shinji fiddled with the sleeves of his business suit. While he would be happiest in America, discussing their next edition with Kensuke, part of him would always belong here. This particular tract of land—not any random part of Japan, not Misato's home, nor Nerv headquarters would always be special to him. This was the last connection he had to his mother. The only son of Yui Ikari reached out a hand to trace the eroded letters of her name.  
真嗣摆弄着西装袖口。虽然在美国与健介讨论下一版的内容会让他感到最快乐，但他的内心总有一部分留在这里。这片特定的土地——不是日本随便哪个地方，不是美里小姐的家，也不是 NERV 总部，对他来说永远特别。这是他与母亲最后的联系。碇唯唯一的儿子伸出手，抚摸着她名字上风化的痕迹。

She had always wanted him to be happy. Shinji smiled, knowing she would be proud to see him today.  
她一直希望他能幸福。真嗣微笑着，知道她今天看到他会感到骄傲。

With that thought on his mind, Shinji stood up, brushed the soil off of his knees, picked up his briefcase, and left the cemetery.  
带着这个念头，真嗣站起身，拍掉膝盖上的泥土，拿起公文包，离开了墓园。

= = = = = = =

"So what's he like?" "他是个什么样的人？"

Kimie was perched on a chair so that she could reach the tabletop, where she was busily stirring batter for a loaf of bread. Misato had left early in the morning to drive Ritsuko home, and had decided to spend the night there as well—due in part to Ritsuko's cajoling. The doctor had not felt it safe for Misato to drive eight hours in one day, given the occurrences of last time. With only Shinji home for dinner, Asuka had quickly invited Kimie over. At the very least she could act as a buffer between them.  
纪美子坐在椅子上，以便能够够到桌面，她正忙着搅拌一团做面包的面糊。美里一大早就开车送律子回家，并决定在那里过夜——部分原因是律子的劝说。考虑到上次发生的事情，律子觉得让美里一天开八小时车不安全。晚餐时只有真嗣在家，明日香很快邀请了纪美子过来。至少她可以充当他们之间的缓冲。

"He's all right. It's hard trying to talk to him," Asuka confessed. Even after they had shared the house for nearly a week, the redhead was finding it difficult to initiate conversations. He remembered everything, and she remembered practically nothing. It was clear that she was thirsting for knowledge, and his interests lay in adding to the cement wall he had built up against the past. "That should be enough, Kimie. Here, pour it into this pan."  
"他还不错。但很难跟他聊天，"明日香坦白道。尽管他们已经同住一个屋檐下近一周，红发女孩发现很难开启对话。他记得所有事情，而她几乎什么都不记得。很明显，她渴望获取知识，而他的兴趣在于加固他用来抵御过去的混凝土墙。"应该够了，纪美子。来，倒进这个盘子里。"

She held the pan out with both hands, but Kimie didn't pour the batter.  
她双手捧着平底锅，但 Kimie 并没有倒面糊。

"Asuka-san," the girl said at last, "shouldn't you hold it over the sink, so that anything we spill will go down the drain instead of on the floor?"  
“明日香姐姐，”女孩终于开口道，“你是不是应该把锅举在水槽上方，这样我们洒出来的东西会流进下水道，而不是弄脏地板？”

Drawn out of her temporary trance, Asuka flushed and quickly moved the pan.  
被暂时的心神恍惚拉回现实，明日香脸一红，迅速移动了平底锅。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"You've got lots of things on your mind," the girl commented quietly, indirectly accepting the apology. It was not a plea to hear more about Asuka's life, but the redhead spoke anyway.  
"你心里装着很多事，" 女孩轻声评论道，间接接受了道歉。这并非请求更多了解明日香的生活，但红发女孩还是继续说了下去。

"We knew each other when we were just a little older than you," Asuka told her, "and I wasn't very nice to him. Although I don't remember any of it now, he does. Now—" she hesitated for just a moment—"although I know he's long forgiven me for it, I still feel ashamed of what I did, whenever I see him."  
"我们相识时，年纪比你现在稍大一些，" 明日香告诉她，"那时我对他的态度并不好。虽然我现在已不记得那些事，但他却记得。如今——" 她稍稍停顿了一下——"尽管我知道他早已原谅了我，但每次见到他，我仍为自己所做的事感到羞愧。"

To her surprise, Kimie did not offer sympathy. "What happened in the past happened, and we can't change it. Since he forgave you and wants to be friends again, you should take that chance."  
令她意外的是，希美并没有给予同情。“过去的事已经发生了，我们无法改变。既然他原谅了你，并希望重归于好，你应该抓住这个机会。”

Asuka dropped the pan. Batter splattered over the sides into the sink.  
明日香失手掉了平底锅。面糊溅到了水槽的边缘。

"Sorry," she apologized hastily and began to clean. But Kimie was faster, disposing of the mess in a matter of seconds.  
“对不起，”她急忙道歉并开始清理。但希美动作更快，几秒钟内就处理掉了混乱。

"That's why we did it over the sink," she laughed. Seeing Asuka's thoughtful expression, however, she shrugged. "Well, it's always sorted out Makoto's problems."  
"这就是为什么我们在水槽边做的，"她笑着说。然而，看到明日香沉思的表情，她耸了耸肩。"嗯，这总是能解决真琴的问题。"

How mature she is, thought Asuka in admiration.  
她多么成熟啊，明日香赞叹地想。

The rest of the hour was spent laughing over the antics of Makoto and his younger brother while they cooked. By the time the doorbell rang, Asuka had set several platters of food on the table and Kimie was busily slicing the freshly baked bread.  
接下来的一个小时里，他们一边做饭一边笑着谈论真琴和他弟弟的滑稽举动。当门铃响起时，明日香已经在桌上摆好了几盘食物，而君子正忙着切刚烤好的面包。

"Something smells good," Shinji commented as Asuka stepped aside to let him in.  
“什么东西闻起来这么香？”真嗣评论道，阿斯卡往旁边一让，让他进来。

Asuka gave a muffled sound of affirmation, then mentally reprimanded herself for not following Kimie's advice. Quickly she led him through the kitchen and to the table, where Kimie gave her an encouraging look. Asuka plunged through the introductions. Then they sat down to eat.'  
阿斯卡发出一声含糊的肯定声，随即在心里责备自己没有听从纪美的建议。她迅速带他穿过厨房来到餐桌前，纪美给了她一个鼓励的眼神。阿斯卡匆匆介绍了一番。随后他们坐下来用餐。

Kimie kept the conversation going, and Shinji seemed perfectly comfortable in her presence. Asuka, on the other hand, kept quiet despite Kimie's frequent glances in her direction, clearly intended to goad her into the conversation. She could avoid the inevitable no more, however, when Kimie jumped up and offered to clean up. Being the polite guest, Shinji objected immediately, but Kimie insisted and all but pushed them outside into the watermelon patch.  
纪美维持着对话的进行，真嗣在她面前似乎非常自在。另一方面，阿斯卡虽然沉默不语，但纪美频繁向她投来的目光显然是想激她加入对话。然而，当纪美跳起来提议去收拾时，阿斯卡再也无法回避了。作为有礼貌的客人，真嗣立刻反对，但纪美坚持己见，几乎把他们推到了西瓜地里。

Asuka said, "How was your day?"  
明日香问道：“今天过得怎么样？”

Shinji shrugged. "It was fine. I went to visit my mother." At Asuka's sudden glance, he continued, "It's the first time I've ever been there alone."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“挺好的。我去看了我妈妈。”在明日香突然的注视下，他继续说道，“这是我第一次一个人去。”

They each chose a watermelon and sat down.  
他们各自选了一个西瓜，坐了下来。

He had parents, Asuka thought, but they were never really parents to him. His mother disappeared so early and his father completely neglected him.  
他有过父母，明日香想，但他们从未真正成为他的父母。他的母亲消失得太早，而父亲完全忽视了他。

He's not all that different from me.  
他和我没什么两样。

"Asuka," Shinji said quietly, "I found out some stuff about your parents."  
“明日香，” 真嗣轻声说道，“我发现了关于你父母的一些事情。”

"Tell me." “告诉我。”

Shinji was hesitant. "Are you sure you want to know?"  
真嗣有些犹豫。“你确定想知道吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

She was facing him now, her sapphire blue eyes focused intently on his face. Shinji felt himself drawing away. He knew the truth was not what she wanted to hear.  
她现在正面对着他，蓝宝石般的眼睛专注地凝视着他的脸。真嗣感到自己在退缩。他知道真相不是她想听到的。

"Your father was never in your life," he said, making it as short and mild as he could, "and we don't know who he was. Your mother died when you were about five or six."  
"你父亲从未在你的生活中出现，" 他说道，尽可能简短温和，"我们甚至不知道他是谁。你母亲在你大约五六岁时去世了。"

"How?" Her eyes were wide.  
"怎么回事？" 她的眼睛睁得大大的。

But before Shinji began to speak, she remembered—and saw—the past.  
但在真嗣开始说话之前，她回忆起了——并看到了——过去。

"She hung herself. She had been in the hospital for a long time, and—Asuka, are you listening?"  
"她上吊了。她在医院里待了很久，而且——明日香，你在听吗？"

For Asuka had finally broken the glance and turned to look away. Shinji's voice faded, and instead she returned to the German hospital as a child.  
因为明日香终于移开了视线，转头望向别处。真嗣的声音逐渐消失，取而代之的是她回到了童年时的德国医院。

= = = = = = =

She was wearing a small red dress with a white collar as she stood outside the wall-sized window of her mother's room. The nurses were speaking about her in hushed undertones, yet she chose not to react.  
她穿着一件红色小裙子，领口是白色的，站在母亲病房那面墙般大的窗户前。护士们在低声细语地谈论她，但她选择不予理会。

"Everyday, she's like that. She talks to the doll, thinking that it's her beloved daughter."  
"每天，她都是那样。她对着那个娃娃说话，以为那是她心爱的女儿。"

"She might feel responsible, in her own way. She devoted her whole life to research, and did not spend the time to take care of her own daughter."  
"她可能以自己的方式感到内疚。她将一生都奉献给了研究，却没有花时间照顾自己的女儿。"

"I sympathize with your grief."  
"我同情你的悲伤。"

I'm not a doll. I'm not that doll in your arms!  
我不是玩偶。我不是你怀里的那个玩偶！

"Asuka-chan, Mama cooked your favorite for you."  
“明日香酱，妈妈给你做了你最喜欢的菜。”

Look at me! 看着我！

"If you complain about what you like and dislike, that girl will laugh at you."  
"如果你抱怨你喜欢和不喜欢的东西，那个女孩会嘲笑你的。"

I'm not a doll! 我不是个玩偶！

Why am I still here?  
为什么我还在这儿？

She doesn't care about me. She doesn't know I exist. To her, I'm nothing but a doll with button eyes and yarn for hair.  
她不在乎我。她不知道我的存在。对她来说，我不过是一个有着纽扣眼睛和毛线头发的玩偶。

Her chin drooped. The scene changed.  
她的下巴垂了下来。场景变了。

"You are so good, my Asuka... you may cry if you wish."  
“你真好，我的明日香……如果你想哭，就哭吧。”

"It's okay." I am stronger than her. I can survive alone.  
"没事的。我比她更坚强。我可以独自生存。"

"I won't cry. I can think for myself."  
"我不会哭的。我可以自己思考。"

She stared at the stony words with a defiant glare. Sorhyu Kyoko Zeppelin. 1974 - 2005.  
她以挑衅的目光盯着那些冷冰冰的字句。索尔休·京子·齐柏林。1974 - 2005。

I am not a baby. I will become an adult earlier than other people.  
我不是小孩子。我会比其他人更早成为大人。

And I don't need a teddy bear.  
而且我不需要泰迪熊。

= = = = = = =

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

To Shinji's immense relief, her head snapped up at his sharp voice. "Asuka, are you all right?"  
让真嗣大大松了一口气的是，她听到他尖锐的声音后猛地抬起头来。“明日香，你还好吗？”

She nodded weakly. 她虚弱地点了点头。

"You're crying," he said quietly, and reached into his pocket for a tissue. Asuka took it and sniffled.  
"你在哭，" 他轻声说道，伸手从口袋里掏出一张纸巾。明日香接过纸巾，抽泣了一下。

"I remember." Her throat constricted and she was unable to get any more words out. Not that she really wanted to, either.  
"我记得。" 她的喉咙紧缩，无法再说出更多的话。其实，她也不太想说了。

He let her cry herself out. As soon as the initial wave of remembrance and sorrow washed over her, Asuka was overwhelmed by shame. What did she think she was doing, crying in front of him? His childhood had not been any easier than hers. Why then, had she allowed herself to falter, while he had succeeded?  
他让她哭个够。当最初的回忆和悲伤浪潮般袭来时，明日香被羞愧淹没。她以为自己在做什么，在他面前哭泣？他的童年并不比她的轻松。那么，为什么她会让自己动摇，而他却成功了呢？

There is no one to blame but myself, Asuka thought. She tilted her head back and sniffled, commanding the tears to stop.  
只能怪我自己，明日香心想。她仰起头，吸了吸鼻子，命令泪水停止。

"I'm sorry," she whispered, as soon as she could trust her voice.  
“对不起，”她一能控制住声音就低声说道。

"Don't be." Shinji relaxed his gaze on her and stared out into the distance. "Maybe I shouldn't have told you."  
"别这样。" 真嗣放松了对她的注视，望向远方。"也许我不该告诉你。"

"It's fine." A breeze rippled through Asuka's hair and she shivered.  
"没事的。" 一阵微风吹过明日香的头发，她微微颤抖。

Shinji reached out and patted a nearby watermelon. "Shall we split a watermelon?"  
真嗣伸出手拍了拍旁边的西瓜。"我们切个西瓜吃吧？"

Asuka jumped to her feet. "No, I'm not hungry." The wind blew and she shivered uncontrollably. "I think I'm going to go inside. It's cold out here."  
明日香猛地站起身。“不，我不饿。”风一吹，她不由自主地颤抖起来。“我想我还是进屋去吧，外面太冷了。”

Shinji quickly offered his jacket, but Asuka declined and ran into the warm and toasty house.  
真嗣迅速递上自己的外套，但明日香婉拒后跑进了温暖舒适的屋内。

"Asuka-san!" “明日香小姐！”

Asuka was calmed by Kimie's simple presence. Here was a girl who didn't know of her tragic past and who didn't care to ask or tell her about it. She breathed heavily, glancing around the well-lit room. There was the table, the bookshelf, the clock, where they had always been. The German hospital faded away.  
阿斯卡在纪美的简单陪伴下平静了下来。这是一个对她悲惨过去一无所知，也不好奇或提及的女孩。她沉重地呼吸着，环顾着灯火通明的房间。桌子、书架、时钟，一切如常。德国的医院渐渐远去。

Kimie took one glance at Asuka's harried face and declined to comment. "I'm almost finished cleaning up," she said smoothly. "You should go upstairs and lie down."  
纪美瞥了一眼阿斯卡焦虑的脸庞，没有发表评论。“我差不多打扫完了，”她平静地说，“你应该上楼躺下休息。”

Asuka nodded and did so.  
阿斯卡点点头，照做了。

Shinji appeared a moment later, looking none less harried than Asuka. He glanced around frantically, but the redhead was nowhere to be seen. The girl at the sink had an answer for him, however.  
不久后，真嗣出现了，看起来并不比明日香轻松。他焦急地四处张望，但红发女孩却不见踪影。不过，在水槽边的女孩给了他一个答案。

"Asuka-san's gone up to lie down," she informed him quietly as she dried her hands on a towel. "She looked like she wanted to be alone."  
“明日香桑上楼去躺下了，”她一边用毛巾擦干手，一边轻声告诉他，“她看起来想一个人待着。”

Shinji nodded, not completely reassured. "Thanks."  
真嗣点点头，并未完全放心。“谢谢。”

Kimie nodded. "I'll be going home now. Tell Asuka-san I hope she feels better."  
希美点点头。“我现在要回家了。告诉明日香小姐，希望她感觉好些。”

As soon as the door shut behind her, Shinji made his way around to the room Misato and Asuka shared. The door was closed but a sheet of light shone from the space beneath the door. Inside, he could hear her sobbing.  
她一关上门，真嗣就走向了美里和明日香共用的房间。门是关着的，但门缝下透出一束光。他可以听到里面的哭泣声。

Shinji raised a hand to knock on the door, but recalled Kimie's advice. Slowly he retreated back to his place on the couch, drew the blankets up to his chin, and drifted off to sleep.  
真嗣举起手准备敲门，但想起了希美的建议。他慢慢地退回到沙发上，拉起毯子盖到下巴，渐渐进入了梦乡。

= = = = = = =

A loud, retching sound awoke him in the early hours of the morning. Shinji propped himself up on one elbow, then the other. Asuka's room was on the other side of the house, but he could see a faint yellow light. When the noises continued, Shinji crept out of bed and opened her door.  
清晨时分，一阵剧烈的呕吐声将他惊醒。真嗣用一只胳膊肘撑起身体，然后换到另一只。明日香的房间在屋子的另一侧，但他能看到一抹微弱的黄光。当声音持续不断时，真嗣悄悄下床，打开了她的房门。

Asuka was bent over the toilet, her hands clutching the edge of the sink. Her feet looked unstable and her legs quivered unstoppably.  
明日香正弯腰对着马桶，双手紧抓着洗手台的边缘。她的双脚看起来不稳，双腿无法控制地颤抖。

"Asuka, are you all right?"  
“明日香，你还好吗？”

"I'm fine!" she cried out in an unusually high-pitched voice before bending over again. Shinji turned his head away as he wondered what he ought to do. Asuka solved that problem for him.  
"我没事！" 她用异常尖锐的声音喊道，随即再次弯下腰。真嗣转过头去，不知道该怎么办。明日香为他解决了这个问题。

"I'm fine!" she insisted, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand as she came to the door. Her face was flushed and her eyes bright, framed loosely by her tousled hair. "Go back to bed!"  
"我没事！" 她坚持道，用手背擦了擦嘴，走到门口。她的脸颊通红，眼睛明亮，被蓬松的头发随意地框住。"回去睡觉！"

It was a command, and Shinji obeyed, honestly believing she'd be much better in the morning. He climbed back onto his couch and quickly fell asleep.  
这是一个命令，真嗣服从了，真心相信她早上会好很多。他爬回自己的沙发上，很快又睡着了。

It was one of the worst assumptions he'd ever made.  
这是他曾做过的最糟糕的假设之一。

= = = = = = =

When she was sure that he'd finally gone back to bed, Asuka washed her mouth out thoroughly to get rid of the acrid taste, then put on a jacket and turned off the light. She certainly had no intention of going back to bed.  
当她确信他已经回到床上后，明日香彻底漱口以去除那股苦涩的味道，然后穿上外套并关掉了灯。她当然没有打算再回到床上。

Asuka slipped the door open just a crack, but Shinji's snores were already quite audible. She opened the door wider and left. A few more steps and she was out of the house.  
明日香轻轻地将门拉开一条缝，但真嗣的鼾声已经相当明显。她将门开得更大，然后走了出去。再走几步，她就离开了房子。

How nice the cool night air felt on her warm cheeks.  
凉爽的夜风拂过她温热的脸颊，感觉多么美好。

Asuka began to walk, trying to take her mind off of the tragedies she had just been reminded of. An owl hooted over her head and she paused for a moment to watch its majestic flight into the night.  
明日香开始行走，试图将刚刚被提醒的悲剧从脑海中移开。一只猫头鹰在她头顶上鸣叫，她停下片刻，注视着它威严地飞入夜空。

She walked barefoot through the woods, letting the cold seep through her skin as the briars tore at her clothes. She wasn't scared. She just needed a moment to reorganize her thoughts. Asuka exited the woods and came to the edge of Tokyo-3.  
她赤脚穿过树林，让寒冷渗透皮肤，荆棘撕扯着她的衣服。她并不害怕。她只是需要片刻时间来重新整理思绪。明日香走出树林，来到了第三新东京市的边缘。

She could see the tall buildings of the city in the distance, glowing various colors from their lights. The streets, however, were quiet and nearly empty, a nice change from the usual day crowd. She wondered who else was awake in the morning.  
她能看到远处城市高楼的轮廓，灯光闪烁着各种颜色。然而，街道却异常安静，几乎空无一人，与白日拥挤的景象截然不同。她不禁好奇，还有谁在这清晨时分醒着。

Asuka continued her trek. She didn't feel the numbing of her feet from the cold, only the heatedness of her cheeks and forehead. The wind had no effect on her anymore. She felt very alone—and oddly, very strong. There was nothing she couldn't do alone. Asuka glanced up, noticing that the lights seemed to blend together into a multicolor haze. Then she stepped into the street.  
明日香继续前行。她并未感受到双脚因寒冷而麻木，只觉得脸颊和额头热乎乎的。风已不再对她产生影响。她感到异常孤独——却又奇怪地感到异常坚强。独自一人，她无所不能。明日香抬头望去，发现灯光似乎融为一体，形成了一片五彩斑斓的迷雾。随后，她踏上了街道。

She never saw the car.  
她从未注意到那辆车。

= = = = = = =

Something jolted Shinji awake and he was deeply irritated for being interrupted twice in one night. Sitting up, however, he realized that the door to Asuka's room was not emitting any light around it—it was open. Her room appeared simply to be a large, dark space.  
某种动静惊醒了真嗣，他因一夜之间两次被打断而深感恼火。然而，当他坐起身时，发现明日香房间的门并没有透出任何光线——它是开着的。她的房间看起来就像一个巨大而黑暗的空间。

Asuka never slept with the door open. Confused, Shinji reluctantly got to his feet and went to check up on her.  
明日香从不会开着门睡觉。真嗣感到困惑，不情愿地站起身，前去查看她的情况。

The first thing he saw was that her blankets were strewn across the room, her closet door wide open, and her favorite jacket gone. Terror streaked through him as he ran to the door, grabbed his shoes, and hurried outside without bothering to put them on.  
他首先看到的是她的被子散落一地，衣橱门大敞着，她最爱的夹克不见了。恐惧如电流般贯穿全身，他冲向门口，抓起鞋子，急忙冲出门外，甚至顾不上穿上它们。

She was nowhere to be seen outside, but beyond the woods that surrounded Misato's house—Shinji's heart sank—he could make out flashing red and blue lights, and the siren could be heard plainly.  
她在外面不见踪影，但穿过环绕美里家的树林——真嗣的心沉了下去——他能看到闪烁的红蓝灯光，警笛声清晰可闻。

The shoes dropped from Shinji's numb fingers as he took off at a run towards the light.  
鞋子从真嗣麻木的手指间滑落，他朝着灯光的方向飞奔而去。

Author's note: I felt bad about making this a cliffhanger, so I decided to post up two chapters at the same time. Drop me a review and tell me what you think!  
作者的话：我觉得让这成为一个悬念不太好，所以我决定同时发布两章。给我留个评论，告诉我你的想法吧！

### Chapter 10: Asuka Alone  
第十章：明日香独行  

She hated the night shift. She hated the loneliness of the empty hallways, the silence of the sleeping patients. Most of all she hated almost drifting off to sleep before being rudely awakened by the shouts that signaled the arrival of another patient barely clinging to life.  
她讨厌夜班。她讨厌空荡荡走廊的孤寂，讨厌沉睡病人的静默。最让她讨厌的是，几乎要睡着时，却被那些标志着又一个生命垂危病人到来的喊叫声粗暴地唤醒。

Tonight was one of those nights, where the dim lights had quickly sealed Hazuki-san's eyes before a loud shout drew her out of her trance. Annoyed, she shook her head and clamped her hair back, then ran to the scene.  
今晚就是那样的夜晚，昏暗的灯光很快让长月女士闭上了眼睛，直到一声大喊将她从恍惚中拉回。她恼怒地摇了摇头，束起头发，然后跑向现场。

She could hardly believe what she was seeing.  
她几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。

Her first reaction was fury, to lash out at the purple-haired woman who had allowed this to happen. In her heart she had always felt that that woman could not be trusted. The anger dissipated quickly into guilt. She should not have let that precious child go with her.  
她的第一反应是愤怒，想要对那个允许这一切发生的紫发女子发泄。在她心里，她一直觉得那个女人不可信任。但这种愤怒很快就被愧疚所取代。她不应该让那个珍贵的孩子跟她走的。

Asuka-chan lay motionless on a stretcher, an oxygen mask clamped over her face. Her arms and legs were loosely strapped down with wide strips of black Velcro—not that it mattered, since they weren't moving. Her copper hair bounced with the rapid movement of the cart. Paramedics were running along beside her, some yelling out instructions, another opening her eye to shine a light on it.  
明日香躺在担架上，一动不动，氧气面罩紧紧扣在她的脸上。她的手臂和双腿被宽大的黑色维可牢带子松松地固定住——尽管这无关紧要，因为它们并没有动。她那铜色的头发随着推车的快速移动而跳动。医护人员在她旁边奔跑，有的在喊着指令，另一个则打开她的眼睛，用灯光照射。

Hazuki-san put a hand to the girl's forehead. She was hot and feverish. The anger surged back again. Who would have let someone her condition out in the middle of the night?  
Hazuki-san 将手放在女孩的额头上。她发烧了，体温很高。怒火再次涌上心头。谁会在深夜让一个状况如此糟糕的人外出？

But this was not her place—at least, not yet. She would not be permitted inside while the surgeons fought to save Asuka-chan's life. Only later, and Hazuki-san shivered—if she lived, would she be allowed to see her through her recovery.  
但这里不是她的位置——至少现在还不是。在医生们奋力抢救 Asuka-chan 的生命时，她不会被允许进入。只有之后，Hazuki-san 颤抖着——如果她活下来，她是否能被允许在她康复期间看望她。

There was nothing she could do now but wait. She hovered by the doorway, watching the paramedics hurry Asuka-chan into the operating room.  
现在她无能为力，只能等待。她徘徊在门口，看着医护人员匆忙将 Asuka-chan 送进手术室。

There would be no more rest for her tonight.  
今晚她将无法再得到片刻休息。

= = = = = = =

Somehow—he didn't know how, the last half hour was an utter blur—Shinji had convinced the paramedics to let him on the ambulance, but they had paid no attention to him afterwards. Alone and terrified, he walked in circles around the hospital waiting area, not daring to wander in the direction that they had taken her. His ears were strained from listening, yet he was terrified of hearing the low, flat beep that would signal the end.  
不知怎么的——他不知道是怎么做到的，过去的半小时完全是一片模糊——真嗣说服了救护人员让他上了救护车，但之后他们就没再理会他。孤独而恐惧的他，在医院等候区绕着圈子走来走去，不敢朝他们带走她的方向走去。他的耳朵因倾听而绷紧，却又害怕听到那预示着终结的低沉、平直的哔声。

He glanced hopefully towards the front desk, but the woman was busy talking on the phone. The only other nurse on duty was sitting in a corner, facing away. She appeared distraught and near tears. He'd seen her hurry towards Asuka when they had first brought her in, but she'd been quickly pushed aside.  
他满怀希望地瞥向服务台，但那位女士正忙着打电话。唯一值班的另一位护士坐在角落里，背对着他。她看起来心烦意乱，几乎要哭出来。他曾看到她一开始就急忙朝明日香跑去，但很快就被推到了一边。

He pulled out his cell phone and pressed a tiny elusive button on the side. Immediately the screen lit up to display the following words:  
他掏出手机，按下了侧面一个微小而难以察觉的按钮。屏幕立刻亮起，显示出以下文字：

You have no new voice messages.  
您没有新的语音留言。

Shinji fiddled with the buttons using only his thumb, and a minute later held the miniscule device to his ear.  
真嗣只用拇指拨弄着按键，一分钟后将这个小巧的设备贴在耳边。

There was only one person he could turn to. Misato.  
他只能求助于一个人。美里。

The phone rang over and over again as Shinji counted in his head. He knew that Misato liked to stay up late—a habit that had often irked him. Why then, was she not doing so the one night that mattered?  
电话一遍遍地响着，真嗣在心里默默数着。他知道美里喜欢熬夜——这个习惯经常让他感到烦恼。那么，为什么在今晚这个重要的时刻，她却没有这样做呢？

Ritsuko's answering machine came on. Frustrated, Shinji hung up, then immediately redialed.  
律子的答录机接通了。真嗣沮丧地挂断电话，随即又立刻重拨。

He was greeted by the recording again. In the hope that it would wake one of them up, Shinji strode outside, redialed, and yelled out at the top of his lungs what had just happened. Then he hung up and walked back in amidst stares from the two nurses.  
他又听到了那段录音。抱着唤醒其中一人的希望，真嗣大步走到外面，重新拨打电话，用尽全力大喊刚刚发生的事情。随后他挂断电话，在两名护士的注视下走回屋内。

Within ten minutes there was a call from a groggy-sounding Ritsuko, who almost instantly snapped awake upon hearing what had happened, and hurried to wake the still-sleeping Misato.  
不到十分钟，一个声音迷糊的律子打来了电话，她几乎立刻就清醒过来，听到发生的事情后，急忙去叫醒还在熟睡的美里。

Misato wanted to hurry over right away, but both Ritsuko and Shinji dissuaded her, not trusting her driving skills in the middle of the night. The call ended with Misato promising to hurry over at daybreak and Ritsuko sending her best wishes and hopes for Asuka. With no one to talk to now, Shinji chose a squashy armchair by the fake fireplace and sat down.  
美里想立刻赶过来，但律子和真嗣都劝阻了她，不放心她在深夜的驾驶技术。通话结束时，美里承诺天一亮就赶来，律子则向明日香送上最美好的祝愿和希望。现在无人可谈，真嗣选择了一张靠近假壁炉的柔软扶手椅坐下。

There was no way to describe what he was feeling; he hadn't had this sensation since the days he piloted Eva. Since the day he'd heard of Toji's death. Shinji felt the old wave of sorrow and regret washing over him again. It had been his fault then, and it was his fault now.  
无法形容他此刻的感受；自从他驾驶 Eva 以来，这种感觉已经很久没有出现过了。自从得知冬二去世的那一天起。真嗣再次感受到了那股熟悉的悲伤和悔恨浪潮。那时是他的错，现在也是他的错。

His fault that Toji had lost his leg and died so young. His fault that Toji's life had been such a waste. His fault that Hikari had suffered so needlessly afterwards.  
是他的错，让冬二失去了腿，英年早逝。是他的错，让冬二的生命如此虚度。是他的错，让光子之后遭受了那么多无谓的痛苦。

And now, his fault that Asuka was—he cringed at the thought—possibly dying.  
而现在，也是他的错，让明日香——他想到这里不禁皱眉——可能正在死去。

Shinji realized that his muscles were sore from being so taut in anxiety. He stretched them a bit, then noticed he was attracting even more odd looks from the nurses. He sat still, looking down at the ground. His feet were bare. In the panic of the last hour, Shinji had long since forgotten what he was wearing. He pulled his legs up to his chest and hugged his knees to his body. It seemed like an eternity ago that he, Asuka, and Kimie had been sitting around Misato's dinner table laughing and talking.  
真嗣意识到自己的肌肉因过度紧张而酸痛。他稍微伸展了一下，随即注意到护士们投来的目光更加怪异。他静静地坐着，低头看着地面。他的脚是光着的。在过去的慌乱中，真嗣早已忘记自己穿了什么。他抱起双腿，将膝盖紧贴胸前。仿佛是上辈子的事了，他和明日香、美惠还有美里围坐在餐桌旁，谈笑风生。

If only he'd been sterner, stayed with her to make sure she was all right. He'd known she was sick. Anybody would have known from her flushed face and bright eyes. If only he hadn't been so lenient...  
如果当时他能更坚决些，留下来确保她没事就好了。他知道她病了。任何人都能从她通红的脸颊和明亮的眼睛看出来。如果当时他没有那么宽容...

The wait seemed interminable.  
等待似乎永无止境。

Shinji came slowly to realize that the shouts had stopped. He could only think of two things this could mean: either the worst was over, or ... Shinji shivered and cut off the idea mid-thought.  
真嗣渐渐意识到那些喊叫声已经停止了。他只能想到这可能意味着两件事：要么最糟糕的时刻已经过去，要么……真嗣打了个寒颤，中途打断了那个念头。

A deep, resonating sound made him jump, but neither nurse reacted. He looked up to see that he was sitting right in front of an elegant grandfather clock. The time was exactly 3:00 AM.  
一阵深沉、回响的声音让他跳了起来，但两位护士都没有反应。他抬头一看，发现自己正坐在一个优雅的落地钟前。时间正好是凌晨 3 点整。

Silence. 寂静。

Why didn't I stop her?  
我为何没有阻止她？

She wanted to be alone.  
她想独自一人。

But... 但是...

Shinji closed both eyes and placed his forehead against his knees, plunging himself into a world of darkness. He thought of Asuka across the years. Asuka before he knew her, at the bedside of her mother. Asuka at her mother's funeral, wearing a glare much too old for her young face. Asuka slapping Toji in Germany. Asuka climbing into his bed. Asuka arguing with Rei. Asuka piloting Eva. Asuka emerging, victorious time after time.  
真嗣闭上双眼，将额头抵在膝盖上，沉入一片黑暗之中。他回想起这些年来的明日香。在他认识她之前的明日香，在母亲病床边的明日香。母亲葬礼上的明日香，那张稚嫩的脸上带着过于成熟的怒容。在德国掌掴冬二的明日香。爬上他床的明日香。与丽争吵的明日香。驾驶 EVA 的明日香。一次又一次胜利归来的明日香。

Asuka, her face red and feverish. Asuka, limp on a stretcher.  
明日香，脸颊通红，热得发烫。明日香，瘫软在担架上。

Shinji gasped for air, both hands clutching at his hair.  
真嗣喘着气，双手紧紧抓着自己的头发。

He heard sharp rhythmic clicks. A moment later he found a large, worn blanket being draped around his shoulders.  
他听到清脆而有节奏的咔嗒声。片刻后，他感到一条大而磨损的毯子披在了肩上。

"I'm going to check on her," a voice said, and he turned around to see the older nurse, the one that had been sitting in the corner, standing by his side. "Keep yourself warm. I'll be back soon."  
“我去看看她，”一个声音说道，他转过身来，看到那位年长的护士，就是一直坐在角落里的那位，站在他身边。“别让自己着凉了。我很快回来。”

But she didn't. Shinji watched the second hand dally by each black line before hopping to the next.  
但她没有回来。真嗣看着秒针在每条黑线前徘徊，然后跳到下一条。

The clock read 3:10. 时钟显示 3 点 10 分。

= = = = = = =

"Are you sure about this? I could come with you—no, actually I can't—"  
"你确定要这么做吗？我可以跟你一起去——不，实际上我不能——"

"It's fine." Misato cut her old friend off. Ritsuko didn't look convinced, however; Misato seemed to have developed numerous wrinkles overnight and there were deep purple bags under her eyes. She nodded slowly. "Drive carefully. Tell Asuka I'll be thinking of her."  
"没事的。" 美里打断了她的老朋友。但律子看起来并不信服；美里似乎一夜之间多了许多皱纹，眼底下是深深的紫黑色眼袋。她缓缓点头。"开车小心。告诉明日香我会想着她的。"

Misato nodded, not meeting Ritsuko's eyes. The blonde stood up and waved as Misato backed into the street. She knew the former commanding officer had been eaten up with worry all night.  
美里点点头，没有直视律子的眼睛。金发的她站起身来，挥手告别，看着美里退到街上。她知道这位前指挥官整晚都被焦虑吞噬着。

Misato remembered Ritsuko's worried face as she pulled into the parking lot of the hospital. She glanced at her watch. It was just past eight. It had taken her just over two hours to make the long drive from Kyoto back to Tokyo-3.  
美里回想起律子那忧心忡忡的面容，当她驶入医院的停车场时。她瞥了一眼手表，刚过八点。从京都长途驱车回到第三新东京市，她花了两个多小时。

She pulled out her cell phone as she ran, desperate yet fearful of any messages that had come in during the drive. She'd shut it off earlier, not really wanting to know the latest news. The device whirred slowly to life, then informed Misato she had no new messages.  
她一边奔跑一边掏出手机，既渴望又害怕在行驶途中收到的任何消息。之前她关掉了手机，并不真正想知道最新的消息。设备缓缓启动，然后告诉美里她没有收到新消息。

Is that a good thing? she wondered as she hurried in.  
那是件好事吗？她一边想着，一边匆匆走了进去。

The room was deadly silent. No cries of children like last time, no anxious relatives waiting for news of their loved ones. Shinji was nowhere to be seen.  
房间里死一般寂静。没有像上次那样的孩子们的哭声，也没有焦急等待亲人消息的亲属。真嗣也不见踪影。

Misato steeled herself, then walked up to the front desk.  
美里鼓起勇气，然后走向前台。

"I'm here to see Sorhyu Asuka Langley."  
“我来见惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”

Pause. 停顿。

The nurse looked her up and down, an odd expression on her face. Had Misato not been so worried, she might have let out a sharp retort. Years of giving orders at Nerv had taught her to expect quick, nimble responses.  
护士上下打量着她，脸上带着一种奇怪的表情。如果不是那么担心，Misato 可能会脱口而出一句尖锐的反驳。在 Nerv 多年下达命令的经历教会了她期待迅速敏捷的回应。

Slowly the nurse moved her hand to the computer and clicked twice with one elegant, manicured finger. "Room 355."  
护士缓缓地将手移向电脑，用一只优雅、涂着指甲油的手指点击了两下。"355 号房间。"

She's alive. 她还活着。

Misato moved rapidly towards Asuka's room, hoping for Shinji to look at her with a face of relief, or anything—anyone—to tell her that she was all right. The elevator doors opened to reveal not Shinji, but instead—  
美里迅速向明日香的房间走去，希望真嗣能用释然的表情看着她，或者任何人的表情——告诉她一切都好。电梯门打开，映入眼帘的不是真嗣，而是——

Smack. 啪。

One hand flew to the cheek that had been slapped, while the other flew out in retaliation.  
一只手捂住了被扇的脸颊，另一只手则本能地挥出还击。

"What were you thinking?" the nurse ground out. "Letting her out in the middle of the night, in her condition?"  
"你当时在想什么？" 护士咬牙切齿地说，"让她在半夜出去，还处于那种状态？"

"I—wasn't—home!" Misato retaliated, extremely annoyed now that her cheek was stinging, one wrist was clasped in the fingers of this overprotective nurse, and on top of everything, she was being accused of hurting Asuka.  
"我——不在——家！" 美里反驳道，现在她的脸颊火辣辣地疼，一只手腕被这个过度保护的护士紧紧抓住，更糟糕的是，她还被指控伤害了明日香，这让她极度恼火。

Shinji turned around just in time to see Misato throw the nurse against the wall before running towards him, one cheek glowing brilliantly red.  
真嗣转过身来，正好看到美里将护士摔在墙上，然后朝他跑来，一边的脸颊红得发亮。

"I'm sorry, Misato..." "对不起，美里..."

But Misato only shook her head, brushed Shinji aside with a light motion, and ran to the window where she clutched the windowsill so tightly that her knuckles were white. She looked as if she were going to be sick. Shinji ran to her side, thinking he couldn't handle another woman collapsing on him.  
但美里只是摇了摇头，轻轻地将真嗣推到一旁，跑到窗边紧紧抓住窗台，以至于指节都发白了。她看起来像是要吐了。真嗣跑到她身边，心想自己再也承受不了另一个女人在他面前倒下了。

Her voice was weak when she asked, "Is she all right?"  
她虚弱地问道：“她还好吗？”

Shinji nodded, and Misato's knees nearly gave way in relief. His next words, however, made her look at him with anguished eyes.  
真嗣点点头，美里几乎因宽慰而膝盖发软。然而，他接下来的话却让她痛苦地看着他。

"They let me in to see her earlier. She seemed very upset... she kept mumbling a lot about her mother.  
“他们让我早些时候进去看她。她看起来非常不安……一直喃喃自语关于她母亲的事。”

"I'm so sorry, Misato." “我真的很抱歉，美里。”

Misato looked at him, her eyes filled with bewilderment. "Why?"  
美里看着他，眼中满是困惑。“为什么？”

"It's my fault... I should have looked after her... I should have made sure she went back to sleep..."  
“这是我的错……我本该照顾她的……我应该确保她回去睡觉……”

Had the nurse not come up, trembling with rage, and ushered Misato away, she might have lashed out at Shinji. The last thing she needed was him acting like the weak child he had once been.  
如果不是护士气冲冲地上来，把美里赶走，她可能已经对真嗣发火了。她最不需要的就是他表现得像个曾经那个软弱的孩子。

= = = = = = =

Come away with me, Asuka-chan.  
跟我走吧，明日香。

No. I don't want to go.  
不，我不想去。

Die with me. 与我同死。

Her fingers, armed with nails that hadn't been cut in months, tore at the neck of the poor doll. The head came off easily and soared across the room before coming to a stop at Asuka's feet.  
她的手指，武装着几个月未剪的指甲，撕扯着可怜的娃娃的脖子。头颅轻易地脱落，飞过房间，最终停在明日香脚边。

No, Mama. 不，妈妈。

She turned away. 她转身离开。

= = = = = = =

Mama, they chose me! I'm an elite pilot now. I am the best in the whole world! I must keep this a secret, but I'll only tell you Mama. Everybody's so nice to me now. I don't feel lonely anymore. I'm okay now, even without Papa. Look at me, look at me Mama. LOOK, MAMA!  
妈妈，他们选了我！我现在是一名精英飞行员了。我是全世界最棒的！我必须保密，但只告诉你，妈妈。现在大家都对我很好。我不再感到孤单了。即使没有爸爸，我现在也很好。看看我，看看我，妈妈。看啊，妈妈！

No.

Her feet came to a stop. Her eyes widened, the smile still plastered across her young face.  
她的脚步停了下来。她的眼睛睁大，年轻的脸上依然挂着笑容。

No.

Why, Mama? 为什么，妈妈？

The scene remained frozen in front of her. Her mother hanging lifelessly in front of her. The tattered doll at her feet.  
眼前的场景依旧凝固着。她的母亲毫无生气地悬挂在她面前。脚边是那只破烂的玩偶。

Why?

= = = = = = =

I don't need you. I don't need anyone!  
我不需要你。我不需要任何人！

Leave me alone! 别管我！

I hate your sympathy. I don't care! Stop telling me I'm a little girl! I will become an adult before other people!  
我讨厌你的同情。我不在乎！别再叫我小女孩了！我会比其他人更早成为大人！

Sorhyu Kyoko Zeppelin. 索尔休·京子·齐柏林。

Why, Mama? 为什么，妈妈？

Calmer now. 现在平静多了。

Silent as the stone bearing her name.  
静如刻有她名字的石碑。

= = = = = = =

I'm only interested in Kaji-kun.  
我只对加持君感兴趣。

Kaji-kun... Ryoji Kaji...  
加治君... 加持良治...

The only one for whom she cared.  
她唯一在乎的人。

The image of a grinning, unshaven man swam in and out of her sight.  
一个咧嘴笑着的、胡子拉碴的男人的形象在她眼前时隐时现。

Kaji!

You're too young, Asuka. 你太年轻了，明日香。

I'm not! 我不是！

Those things are for when you're older.  
那些东西是给年纪大一点的人用的。

I'm ready! 我准备好了！

Kaji-kun's dead, Asuka. Misato's living in his home now.  
加持君已经去世了，明日香。美里现在住在他的家里。

He's not! 他没有！

Don't lie to me! 别对我撒谎！

= = = = = = =

We must triumph over Misato and Rei. I must have revenge for my hurt pride.  
我们必须战胜美里和绫波。我要为我的自尊心受的伤害复仇。

But Misato's a good person...  
但美里是个好人……

Shut up! Leave me alone!  
闭嘴！别烦我！

Anger. Hot and red as the color of her hair.  
愤怒。如她的发色般炽热鲜红。

Why did you hate her so much?  
你为什么这么恨她？

Shut up! 闭嘴！

I can't take this... 我受不了这个...

Fading into blue loneliness.  
渐渐消融于蓝色的孤寂中。

I'm no different from that doll. Ayanami.  
我和那个玩偶没什么不同。绫波。

Wondergirl. 奇迹少女。

Stop it. 别说了。

I can't fight anymore. 我再也打不下去了。

Do you hear me, Asuka?  
你听到了吗，明日香？

She turned her head as his fist connected with her cheek. A blur of copper. Her hair, unwashed, tangled and tousled, across on her face.  
当他的拳头击中她的脸颊时，她转过头去。一片模糊的铜色。她的头发，未曾清洗，凌乱不堪，散落在脸上。

Alone. 独自一人。

He's progressed from human to monster, Asuka. You are alone.  
他已经从人变成了怪物，明日香。你现在是孤身一人了。

I should never have left Misato...and... and...  
我本不该离开美里……还有……还有……

Shinji... 真嗣...

= = = = = = =

Shinji? Misato? Can you hear me? Can you see me?  
真嗣？美里？你们能听到我吗？你们能看到我吗？

I'm trying to tell you something.  
我正试图告诉你们一些事情。

Silence. 沉默。

Your lips are moving. You're talking. But I can't hear you.  
你的嘴唇在动。你在说话。但我听不见。

I'm alone. 我独自一人。

Hear me... 听我说...

= = = = = = =

With Misato ushered off, promising to return as soon as she got the nurse off of her back, Shinji was left alone again. Through the glass pane he could see her tossing and turning, mumbling words known only to herself. He pressed a hand to the cold glass and lowered his head slowly.  
随着美里被送走，承诺一摆脱护士的纠缠就回来，真嗣再次独自一人。透过玻璃窗，他能看到她在床上辗转反侧，喃喃自语着只有她自己知道的话语。他用手贴着冰冷的玻璃，缓缓低下头。

I'm sorry, Asuka. 对不起，明日香。

Author's notes: Now I feel bad for torturing Shinji, but at least Asuka's not going to die... I promise that!  
作者笔记：现在我为折磨真嗣感到抱歉，但至少明日香不会死...我保证！

### Chapter 11: Awakening
第十一章：觉醒

Misato threw the wilting flowers into the trash and poured the yellowing water down the sink. Perhaps Shinji would not be very happy with her for disposing of his flowers, but the blackening heads of the roses had already begun to dip down, bending almost double, and Misato didn't think it was good luck to keep dead flowers in Asuka's room. Cut roses never lived very long, anyway—this bouquet had only been there for four days. Misato crudely arranged the bouquet of spring blossoms she had purchased, making sure flowers of the same color were not bunched together, then returned to Asuka's room with the vase.  
美里将枯萎的花朵扔进垃圾桶，把发黄的水倒进水槽。也许真嗣不会太高兴她处理了他的花，但玫瑰的黑色花头已经开始下垂，几乎弯成了两半，美里觉得在明日香的房间里留着死花不吉利。无论如何，剪下的玫瑰花从来都活不久——这束花只放了四天。美里粗略地整理了她购买的春日花束，确保相同颜色的花没有扎堆，然后带着花瓶回到了明日香的房间。

Four long, lonely days and four interminably dreadful nights had passed, and there had been little change from the redhead.  
漫长的四天和四个无休止的可怕夜晚过去了，红发女孩的情况几乎没有变化。

Shinji stayed by her side during the day, and when Misato got off from her job she'd come to take over for the night. Apparently Shinji would have had the better end of the deal had he not spent each night pacing and not sleeping. The result was that both were exhausted and felt years older.  
白天，真嗣一直守在她身边，而当美里下班后，她会来接替夜班。显然，如果真嗣没有整夜踱步不眠的话，他会是更占便宜的一方。结果是两人都筋疲力尽，感觉老了许多岁。

As for Asuka, her physical injuries were healing nicely, although the doctors had decided to keep her in the hospital for at least another two weeks, assuring Misato and Shinji that once she woke up they would not need to be there every hour of the day. Both the doctors on her case had agreed that someone she knew ought to be there when she woke up. The tossing and turning had stopped for the most part, but it was an unspoken yet understood fact that she was still going through some heavy mental trauma.  
至于明日香，她的身体伤势正在良好恢复中，尽管医生们决定至少再让她住院两周，并向美里和真嗣保证，一旦她醒来，他们就不需要全天候每小时都在那里。负责她病情的医生们都一致认为，当她醒来时，应该有一个她认识的人在场。大部分时间她不再辗转反侧，但这是一个不言而喻的事实，她仍在经历严重的精神创伤。

Hazuki-san had quickly offered to drop everything to tend to Asuka, but her request was swiftly blocked. On the occasions that she did come in, Misato sat back and let her do whatever was needed. They had not spoken to each other since Misato's first visit after the accident.  
Hazuki-san 很快提出要放下一切来照顾明日香，但她的请求迅速被阻止。在她偶尔来访的时候，美里退到一旁，让她做任何需要做的事情。自从事故后美里的第一次探访以来，她们之间再也没有交谈过。

Misato walked to the window on the other side of Asuka's bed and threw open the curtains. The last few rays of sunlight danced into the room, illuminating Asuka's unresponsive face. She placed both elbows on the window and leaned out, remembering the old days in her old apartment. So many times she, Shinji, Asuka, and Pen-pen had sat out on the balcony and watched the sun dip down below the skyline of Tokyo-3.  
Misato 走到明日香床的另一侧窗前，猛地拉开窗帘。最后几缕阳光跳跃进房间，照亮了明日香毫无反应的脸庞。她将双肘支在窗台上，探出身子，回忆起在旧公寓的往昔时光。多少次，她、真嗣、明日香和企鹅 Pen-pen 一起坐在阳台上，看着夕阳沉入东京-3 的天际线。

Speaking of Pen-pen, she wondered where he'd gone. These days she let him wander around the forest, always leaving a window or small door open for him should he decide to return. The children around her neighborhood would recognize him from a mile away—Pen-pen was nothing short of a celebrity in their eyes. Surprisingly he didn't mind all the rough play and dirty hands that came up to ruffle his feathers. Vaguely Misato remembered recently wiping up muddy penguin prints on the floor—or was that Shinji? But other than that, she hadn't seen her precious penguin in several days. A tear fell from one eye as she looked at the unconscious Asuka and thought of how much she would love to have Pen-pen to hold in her arms now. Even if he was covered from raspberry jelly from somebody's lunch.  
提到 Pen-pen，她不知道他跑哪儿去了。最近她让他自由地在森林里游荡，总是给他留一扇窗或小门，以防他决定回来。她周围的孩子们一眼就能认出他——在他们的眼中，Pen-pen 简直是个名人。令人惊讶的是，他并不介意那些粗鲁的游戏和弄脏他羽毛的脏手。Misato 隐约记得最近擦掉了地板上的泥泞企鹅脚印——还是 Shinji 的？但除此之外，她已经好几天没见到她心爱的企鹅了。当她看着昏迷不醒的 Asuka，想到现在多么希望能抱着 Pen-pen 时，一滴眼泪从她的眼中滑落。即使他身上沾满了某人午餐的覆盆子果酱。

The sun had gone down in the time she'd spent pondering over Pen-pen, leaving the room a dismal bluish-gray. Misato sighed and returned to her chair.  
在她沉思 Pen-pen 的这段时间里，太阳已经落山，房间变得阴沉沉的蓝灰色。Misato 叹了口气，回到她的椅子上。

Another long night had begun.  
又一个漫长的夜晚开始了。

= = = = = = =

"Shinji-kun!" "真嗣君！"

Shinji had barely stepped outside when the call came, and he looked up to see Kimie leading a group of little kids. His heart sank.  
真嗣刚踏出门口，就听到了呼唤声，他抬头一看，是君子带着一群小孩子。他的心沉了下去。

"What happened to Asuka-san?" Kimie came right up to the back doorstep, her eyes focused intently on Shinji's face.  
"明日香小姐怎么了？" 君子直接走到后门台阶前，她的眼睛紧紧盯着真嗣的脸。

"We saw the flashing lights from the road," another child added. "Was she in a car crash?"  
"我们从路上看到了闪烁的灯光，"另一个孩子补充道，"她是不是出了车祸？"

"Yes," Shinji replied bluntly.  
"是的，"真嗣直截了当地回答。"

"Is she all right?!" "她还好吗？！"

Shinji sat down, so that he was roughly the height of some of the younger children. "She's alive," he said quietly, but that did little to relieve the fears of the children. "She's in the hospital now. We don't know when she'll be able to come home. Misato-san's with her now."  
真嗣坐了下来，这样他就和一些年纪较小的孩子们差不多高了。“她还活着，”他轻声说道，但这并没有缓解孩子们的恐惧。“她现在在医院。我们不知道她什么时候能回家。美里小姐现在陪着她。”

Several of the younger kids burst into tears. Kimie held them close, one by one, quieting their sobs. Shinji watched in amazement. This girl was a regular Hikari Horaki—perhaps even more talented. An awkward silence followed, punctuated only by the sporadic sobs of children. In the end, Kimie stood up and chauffeured them home, promising to return if Shinji didn't find her presence bothersome.  
几个年纪较小的孩子突然哭了起来。纪惠一个接一个地把他们抱在怀里，安抚他们的哭泣。真嗣惊讶地看着。这个女孩简直就是光莉穗木的翻版——或许还更有天赋。一阵尴尬的沉默随之而来，只被孩子们断断续续的哭泣声打断。最后，纪惠站起身来，把他们一个个送回家，并承诺如果真嗣不介意她的存在，她会回来。

"No, please do come," Shinji insisted. Anything to keep him from wallowing in fear and guilt.  
“不，请一定要来，”真嗣坚持道。任何事情都好，只要能让他不沉浸在恐惧和愧疚中。

She returned promptly less than ten minutes later and sat down beside him. Shinji was unsure what he ought to say—could he tell her about all of Asuka's past troubles? Would Asuka want him to do that? Even if she did, this girl was sixteen years younger than him, and he wasn't sure if he would feel comfortable telling her. Kimie, however, solved that problem for him by starting the conversation.  
她不到十分钟就迅速回来了，坐在他旁边。真嗣不确定该说些什么——他能告诉她关于明日香过去的所有麻烦吗？明日香会希望他这么做吗？即使她愿意，这个女孩比他小十六岁，他不确定自己是否能自在地告诉她。然而，希美为他解决了这个问题，主动开启了对话。

"I don't think Asuka-san would want for you to be this upset, Shinji-kun," she said quietly.  
“我想明日香小姐不会希望你这么难过的，真嗣君，”她轻声说道。

"Why?" Instead of calming him, all the fear, guilt, and anger poured out of the bottle in his heart. "It's my fault she was hit! My fault that I let her escape! MY fault that she's lying in that hospital now! If I had stopped her, Misato wouldn't be exhausted and spending every night by her side! The kids wouldn't be upset and crying!"  
“为什么？”他非但没有平静下来，心中的恐惧、愧疚和愤怒反而如瓶中倾泻而出。“她被打是我的错！我让她逃走是我的错！她现在躺在医院里也是我的错！如果我阻止了她，美里就不会筋疲力尽，每晚守在她身边！孩子们也不会难过到哭泣！”

Kimie let the rage run itself out before speaking again.  
纪美让怒气自行消散，然后才再次开口。

"She was upset," she recalled, more for Shinji's benefit than herself, "and I believe I was the one who told you to leave her alone."  
“她很沮丧，”她回忆道，更多是为了真嗣的缘故而非自己，“我想是我告诉过你让她一个人待着。”

Shinji nodded in response. Kimie's thoughtful features softened.  
真嗣点头回应。纪美体贴的神情柔和了下来。

"She was afraid of you in a way," she continued. "You have to realize that she was slowly digging up parts of her past, and as much as she wanted to know what happened, every piece of information was a threat that it would be—something that she didn't really want to know and would have been better hidden away. I'm sorry," she apologized, suddenly flustered. "I don't know how to word it in a better way."  
"她对你有一种恐惧感，"她继续说道。"你必须意识到，她正在慢慢挖掘自己过去的片段，尽管她渴望了解发生了什么，但每一条信息都像是一个威胁，可能会揭露她并不真正想知道、最好被隐藏起来的事情。对不起，"她突然慌乱地道歉，"我不知道怎么表达得更恰当。"

But Shinji was already visibly calming, so she continued.  
但真嗣已经明显平静下来，于是她继续说。

"Even the fact that you were a boy worried her somewhat. She said that after waking up from her coma she had had no contact with any boys. And since you knew her in the past—especially after she had made fun of you and hit you many times, perhaps more than she could remember—it was very hard for her to talk to you at all."  
"甚至你是个男孩这件事也让她有些担忧。她说，从昏迷中醒来后，她没有和任何男孩接触过。而因为你了解她的过去——尤其是她曾多次嘲笑你、打你，或许次数多到她自己都记不清了——这让她很难和你交谈。"

Shinji looked at Kimie, surprised. Yes, Asuka had changed; she wasn't flying at him in a rage or yelling at him to cook breakfast anymore; instead she was quiet and shy. He hadn't realized how much guilt she felt for the past, however.  
真嗣惊讶地看着君子。是的，明日香变了；她不再怒气冲冲地向他扑来，也不再吼着让他做早餐；取而代之的是她变得安静而羞涩。他之前并未意识到她对过去感到多么内疚。

"She would never want to hurt you, Shinji-kun. She wouldn't want you to feel this way. She's not a mean person like that."  
“她绝不想伤害你，真嗣君。她不希望你这样感受。她不是那种刻薄的人。”

Shinji nodded. The few last thoughts were something to ponder.  
真嗣点点头。最后那几个念头值得深思。

After a pause, Kimie added, "I'm sorry for intruding in your life."  
停顿片刻后，纪惠补充道：“抱歉打扰了你的生活。”

"No, no," Shinji insisted. Honestly, "The last few days have been really hard for Misato-san and myself. We're very lucky to have someone as understanding as you."  
“不，不，”真嗣坚持说。老实说，“最近几天对美里小姐和我来说真的很艰难。有你这样善解人意的人在身边，我们非常幸运。”

Kimie smiled. "I'd better be getting home now. Makoto has probably gotten himself into trouble."  
纪惠微笑道：“我最好现在回家。诚可能又惹麻烦了。”

Shinji nodded and thanked her, watching the heels of her worn shoes sink into the wet ground with each step. Only when she was out of sight did Shinji realized that she had not asked about Asuka's past, or why she had been so upset that night.  
真嗣点点头向她道谢，注视着她那磨损的鞋跟每走一步就陷入湿润的泥土中。直到她的身影消失，真嗣才意识到她并未询问明日香过去的事情，或是那晚她为何如此心烦意乱。

Indeed, Misato and Asuka were lucky to have her nearby.  
确实，美里和明日香有她在身边是幸运的。

= = = = = = =

Early morning meant sun. It meant the gentle hum of engines whirring to life on the streets. And for Misato, it meant another day of work after a practically sleepless night.  
清晨意味着阳光。意味着街道上引擎缓缓启动的轻柔嗡鸣。而对美里来说，这意味着在几乎彻夜未眠后又一个工作日的开始。

Shinji arrived perfectly on time to take over, looking more rested and alert than he had been in days. Misato was envious.  
真嗣准时到达接班，看起来比前几天更加精神饱满。美里有些羡慕。

They hardly spoke—the usual conversation asking about any changes had grown old. The basic line was that there were none.  
他们几乎没有交谈——询问是否有变化的常规对话早已变得乏味。基本情况是没有任何变化。

Shinji took Misato's seat by Asuka's bed. Something brushed his hair, and he turned to see that his wilting flowers had been replaced by a cheerful bouquet of pink, yellow, and purple spring blossoms. Presumably the work was Misato's, since the flowers on one side of the vase were distinctly taller than those on the other.  
真嗣坐在美里在明日香床边的位置上。有什么东西拂过他的头发，他转头一看，发现自己那束枯萎的花已被一束欢快的粉色、黄色和紫色春花所取代。想必这是美里的杰作，因为花瓶一侧的花明显比另一侧的高。

He returned his attention to Asuka, who didn't seem any livelier than the day before. However, her tossing and turning had stopped, and for that he was grateful. He closed his eyes and thought of Kimie's words.  
他将注意力转回明日香身上，她似乎并不比前一天更有生气。然而，她的辗转反侧已经停止，对此他心怀感激。他闭上眼睛，回想着君子的话。

He wondered what Hikari would have said, if she could see her old friend in this state.  
他不禁想象，如果光子能看到她昔日的朋友处于这种状态，会说些什么。

Shinji shrugged and returned his glance to Asuka's limp body. Her finger twitched, but that didn't concern him—it had happened plenty of times before, usually followed by some involuntary tossing and turning.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，目光再次回到明日香瘫软的身体上。她的手指抽动了一下，但这并未引起他的关注——这种情况以前发生过很多次，通常紧接着会有一些无意识的翻动。

But then her hand was moving, as if grasping for something she couldn't see. Shinji stood up, wondering if he should call for a nurse. Then, miraculously—her eyes opened—and they were no longer bright and glassy, but the sapphire blue eyes he remembered.  
但随后她的手开始移动，仿佛在抓取她看不见的东西。真嗣站起身，疑惑是否应该叫护士。然后，奇迹般地——她的眼睛睁开了——不再是明亮而空洞的，而是他记忆中的蓝宝石般的眼眸。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

= = = = = = =

Shinji? 真嗣？

What is he doing here?  
他在这里做什么？

Where am I? 我在哪儿？

I know where I am. I remember this ceiling, this room, this bed.  
我知道我在哪儿。我记得这天花板，这房间，这张床。

He knows who I am.  
他知道我是谁。

He knows more about me than I know.  
他对我了解得比我对自己还多。

He knows. 他知道。

Don't make me remember...  
别让我记起...

= = = = = = =

"Go away." “走开。”

And with that she turned away and pulled the blanket over her head, her muffled sobs clearly audible. Shinji was left blinking in shock and hurt, hoping desperately that he had misheard, but her current behavior was enough to tell him that he hadn't.  
说完，她转身拉起被子蒙住头，压抑的哭声清晰可闻。真嗣愣在原地，震惊与心痛交织，他拼命希望自己听错了，但她此刻的行为足以告诉他并非如此。

Surely she'll come out in a minute, he thought. He knew from experience that under a blanket was not a good place to hide.  
他心想，她肯定会马上出来的。根据经验，他知道躲在被子底下可不是个好地方。

But she didn't. 但她没有。

= = = = = = =

Asuka was confused and angry—both at Shinji and at herself. She knew she shouldn't have lashed out at him, but for now she couldn't bear to see anyone that would remind her of who she had been. Shinji knew her past, both in Japan and Germany. She couldn't look at him without remembering how she had hurt him. She was embarrassed of that, and even more embarrassed of what had happened between her and Kaji. Not only that, but slowly she was beginning to remember what had happened in the last twelve miserable years since she'd left Shinji and Misato  
明日香感到困惑和愤怒——既对真嗣也对自身。她知道自己不该对他发火，但此刻她无法忍受看到任何会让她想起过去的人。真嗣了解她在日本和德国的过往。她无法直视他而不忆起自己曾如何伤害他。对此她感到羞愧，更羞愧于与加持之间发生的事。不仅如此，她渐渐开始记起离开真嗣和美里后的十二年悲惨岁月中发生的种种。

She couldn't breathe, but surely suffocating a bit was better than having to face Shinji. Her salty tears soaked the fabric around her as she sobbed and whimpered brokenly, hating herself for doing so and for not having the bravery to face the truth. Once again she came back to admiring Shinji for becoming who he had become.  
她无法呼吸，但比起面对真嗣，窒息片刻或许更好。她的泪水浸湿了周围的布料，她抽泣着，断断续续地呜咽，痛恨自己的软弱和缺乏面对真相的勇气。又一次，她开始钦佩真嗣成长为现在的样子。

It's all a cycle, she thought miserably. I admire him, I hate myself, and I become embarrassed of myself.  
这一切都是个循环，她痛苦地想。我钦佩他，我憎恨自己，然后我为自己感到羞愧。

She heard mingling voices, just barely audible, and wondered who was speaking, although she didn't look. A moment later, she could hear Shinji clearly, muttering in a broken voice.  
她听到混杂的声音，隐约可闻，虽未抬头，却好奇是谁在说话。片刻后，她清晰地听到真嗣断断续续的低语。

"I don't know what to do."  
“我不知道该怎么办。”

The lack of air was suffocating her, the underside of the blanket becoming hot and itchy against her skin. Defeated, Asuka emerged, but remained facing away from him despite his pleading words. Eventually she drifted off to asleep.  
空气的缺失让她感到窒息，毯子下侧贴着皮肤变得又热又痒。无奈之下，明日香探出身子，尽管他恳求连连，她依旧背对着他。最终，她渐渐入睡。

She awoke some time later to a tender, feminine voice calling her name. Instinctively Asuka reached for the blanket, intending to pull it over her head again, but something about the voice was enchanting, alluring. Since there was no chance of going back to sleep, Asuka turned herself over, groaning at the pain and exhaustion that still plagued her body.  
她不知过了多久被一个温柔的女性声音唤醒，呼唤着她的名字。本能地，明日香伸手去抓毯子，打算再次将头蒙住，但那声音却异常迷人，充满诱惑。既然无法再入睡，明日香翻了个身，呻吟着承受身体依然缠绕的疼痛与疲惫。

"Kimie!" “君子！”

For a moment the ten-year-old was silent, and Asuka realized she must look terrible, having not brushed her teeth or hair in nearly a week, not to mention the various casts and bandages that covered her body.  
十岁的小女孩沉默了一会儿，明日香意识到自己看起来一定糟透了，已经近一周没有刷牙梳头，更不用说身上覆盖的各种石膏和绷带。

Asuka asked, "Where's Shinji?"  
明日香问道：“真嗣在哪里？”

"I sent him home," the girl replied authoritatively. "He looked like he was in terrible shape."  
“我让他回家了，”女孩权威地回答，“他看起来状态很糟糕。”

The guilt came rushing back.  
内疚感再次涌上心头。

It's my fault for speaking to him like that, after he's probably been sitting here all day.  
我那样跟他说话是我的错，他可能已经在这里坐了一整天。

Kimie stood up and helped to prop her up with some pillows, so that she looked more comfortably rested despite her low spirits.  
纪美站起来，帮她垫了几个枕头，让她看起来更舒适，尽管她情绪低落。

"How're you feeling?" she asked quietly.  
“你感觉怎么样？”她轻声问道。

Asuka paused. "Well, everything hurts," she said, trying for a bit of humor and failing miserably. "Although I feel much worse about hurting Shinji."  
明日香停顿了一下。“嗯，全身都疼，”她试图幽默一点，却失败得一塌糊涂。“不过，我对伤害真嗣感到更难受。”

Silence. 沉默。

"He told you, didn't he?"  
“他告诉你了，对吧？”

"Told me what?" “告诉我什么？”

"Everything." The tears came then, streaming down her face in rivers, as much as she wanted them to stop. "How I used to abuse him, how my mother died, what I did with—"  
“所有的一切。”泪水随即涌出，如河流般顺着她的脸颊流淌，尽管她多么希望它们能停止。“我曾经如何虐待他，我母亲是如何去世的，还有我和——”

"Stop it." The words were soft, yet firm. Kimie took Asuka's hands in her own and waited for Asuka to cry herself out. "He didn't tell me anything, Asuka-san."  
“别说了。”话语虽轻，却坚定有力。纪美子握住明日香的手，等待她哭完。“他什么都没告诉我，明日香小姐。”

How grateful she felt as she absorbed the words.  
她深深感受到这些话语带来的感激之情。

Makoto interrupted the scene by coming up and rudely pushing Kimie aside. "Asuka-san, I brought you some flowers."  
真琴走上前来，粗鲁地推开君子，打断了这一幕。“飞鸟小姐，我给你带了些花。”

As the redhead managed a smile through her tears and thanked him, the understanding expression on Kimie's face faded slowly into one of suspicion. "Wait..." Three confused faces looked up at her. "Makoto! You picked those flowers out of Misato-san's garden, didn't you?"  
当红发女孩含泪勉强微笑并感谢他时，君子脸上理解的表情慢慢变成了怀疑。“等等……”三张困惑的脸抬头看着她。“真琴！你是不是从美里小姐的花园里摘了那些花？”

There was an uncomfortable pause in which Makoto attempted futilely to look innocent.  
一阵尴尬的沉默中，真琴徒劳地试图装出一副无辜的样子。

"I did!" he burst out, and would have begun crying had Asuka quickly not quieted him.  
"我做到了！" 他突然喊道，要不是明日香迅速让他安静下来，他差点就要哭出来了。

"They're lovely, Makoto," she complimented him, smoothing back the muddy roots that jutted out from each stem. "And thank you for saving them. I'm sure that Misato would have run them over trying to drive if you hadn't brought them to me."  
"它们真漂亮，真琴，" 她称赞道，抚平每根茎上突出的泥泞根部。"谢谢你救了它们。我敢肯定，如果你没把它们带给我，美里开车时肯定会压到它们的。"

The young boy's face brightened. "We got to play with Pen-pen yesterday," he explained proudly. "We played blocks, and he was the big bad monster that knocked down our castle."  
小男孩的脸亮了起来。"昨天我们和 Pen-pen 一起玩了，" 他自豪地解释道。"我们玩积木，他是那个推倒我们城堡的大坏怪兽。

Kimie winced as she imagined the horrible treatment Pen-pen must have suffered while playing his part. When she opened her eyes again, Makoto was in front of her, and somehow Asuka's hand had transferred from hers to his.  
纪美子想象着 Pen-pen 在扮演角色时所遭受的可怕待遇，不禁皱起了眉头。当她再次睁开眼睛时，真琴已经站在她面前，不知怎么地，明日香的手已经从她的手上转移到了他的手上。

"Asuka-san," he begged, his eyes pleading with her, "please, please, please come home to us?"  
“明日香小姐，”他恳求道，眼中满是恳求，“求求你，求求你，求求你回家吧？”

Pause. 停顿。

"Yes," Asuka said, "I will."  
“好的，”明日香说，“我会回去的。”

Author's Note: Short chapter... and I realized one very stupid mistake I made: In chapter 4 Misato thinks about the nights she spends sitting outside with Pen-pen...and I haven't mentioned him since! Sorry about that...  
作者的话：短章节……我意识到自己犯了一个非常愚蠢的错误：在第四章中，Misato 想起了她和 Pen-pen 一起坐在外面的那些夜晚……而我自那以后再也没有提到过他！对此我深感抱歉……

Anyway, drop me a review and tell me what you think.  
无论如何，给我留个评论，告诉我你的想法。

### Chapter 12: Shinji Leaves  
第十二章：真嗣离开  

Asuka closed the door behind her and turned the lock with a satisfying click. Slowly she turned around to reveal her reflection in the dimly illuminated mirror. Her hair resembled a fireball, and the rest of her body was none the better. The redhead noticed a small package of amenities wrapped in clear plastic. On it were large green letters: SANITARY.  
明日香关上身后的门，满意地听到锁扣上的咔嗒声。她缓缓转过身，在昏暗的灯光下，镜中映出她的身影。她的头发像一团火焰，而身体的其他部分也好不到哪儿去。红发女孩注意到一小包用透明塑料包裹的便利物品。上面印着大大的绿色字母：卫生用品。

She tore it open and pulled out the plastic comb, slowly working it through her unbrushed hair. Perhaps after getting home she would cut it—then it wouldn't take so long to organize.  
她撕开包装，抽出塑料梳子，缓缓地梳理着未曾打理的头发。或许回家后她会剪掉它——那样整理起来就不会那么费时了。

When she emerged nearly thirty minutes later, arms sore from the battle against her hair, Hazuki-san was waiting outside for her.  
当她几乎三十分钟后走出房间，双臂因与头发的斗争而酸痛时，长月さん正在门外等她。

"I should have given this to you last time." She held out a familiar notebook. A few loose green pages embroidered with cherries fluttered to the ground, each covered with pencil scrawls. Quickly Hazuki-san bent and picked them up, folding them back into the notebook as she murmured, "Gomen, Asuka."  
“上次我应该把这个给你的。”她递出一个熟悉的笔记本。几张绣有樱桃的绿色散页随风飘落，每张都布满了铅笔的潦草字迹。长月さん迅速弯腰捡起它们，边低声说“对不起，明日香”边将它们折回笔记本里。

Asuka took the notebook into her hands silently, her eyes downcast.  
明日香默默地接过笔记本，目光低垂。

"Thanks," she said sadly at last.  
“谢谢。”她终于悲伤地说道。

The nurse looked up at the grandfather clock solemnly. "He should be here soon."  
护士肃穆地抬头看向落地大钟。“他应该快到了。”

Asuka nodded, not lifting her head. She had said He. So it was Shinji who would be coming.  
明日香点点头，没有抬起头来。她提到了“他”。那么，即将到来的是真嗣。

"Would you like me to accompany you?"  
“需要我陪你吗？”

"No." The words came out before she was ready, but as the nurse nodded in calm understanding, Asuka decided it was the correct choice. She didn't want to spend the rest of her life in and out of the hospital.  
“不用。”话一出口，她才意识到自己还没准备好，但看到护士平静地点头表示理解，明日香觉得这是正确的选择。她不想余生就这样在医院进进出出。

The past doesn't matter, she thought to herself. I just have to be ready to face the future.  
过去并不重要，她暗自思忖。我只需准备好迎接未来。

Hazuki-san nodded toward the door, suddenly mute, and Asuka saw the source of her sudden silence: Misato had arrived in her blue car, the left half of which was tipping off the side of the road.  
风见学姐朝门口点了点头，突然沉默了，明日香看到了她突然沉默的原因：美里开着她的蓝色汽车到了，左半边车身正倾斜在路边。

Asuka waved, then turned back to her nurse.  
明日香挥了挥手，然后转身面向她的护士。

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

The nurse shook her head and just smiled.  
护士摇了摇头，只是微笑着。

She watched as Asuka-chan ran outside through the sliding glass doors, the notebook pressed tightly against her chest with both arms. Hazuki-san sighed. It was so hard to be a nurse sometimes. Time after time she watched patients leave, wishing that she had more time to get to know them, but not wanting to prolong their suffering by seeing them return to the hospital.  
她看着明日香-chan 从滑动玻璃门跑出去，笔记本紧紧地抱在胸前。薰-san 叹了口气。有时候做护士真的很不容易。一次又一次，她看着病人离开，希望自己能有更多时间了解他们，但又不想因为看到他们重返医院而延长他们的痛苦。

And Asuka was no exception.  
而明日香也不例外。

= = = = = = =

Misato greeted Asuka as she got her, her light frame aiding slightly to balance the car. "Hey."  
美里迎接明日香上车，她轻盈的身躯稍微帮助平衡了车辆。“嘿。”

"Hi, Misato," Asuka replied. They were several miles down the road before Asuka dared to ask the question she'd been pondering.  
“嗨，美里，”明日香回应道。他们在路上行驶了好几英里后，明日香才鼓起勇气问出了她一直在思考的问题。

"Where's Shinji?" "真嗣在哪儿？"

She'd shortened and reworded the question, instead of bluntly asking, "Why didn't Shinji come?" Shinji had not come to visit since the day she'd blown him off, at least not that she knew of.  
她把问题简化了，换了个说法，没有直接问“为什么真嗣没来？”自从那天她拒绝了他之后，真嗣就没再来过，至少她没注意到。

"He...had other things to tend to," Misato replied, and Asuka did not question further.  
"他...有别的事情要处理，"美里回答道，而明日香没有再追问。

Misato pulled into her driveway a short time later, followed by the excited screams and yells of the children. They had been waiting at the nearest corner, their arms laden with balloons and flowers, and chased the car as it made its way up to the old wooden house. Asuka could barely open her door without pushing someone over. Misato got out of her side, which was devoid of cheerers, and promptly cleared the children away so that Asuka could get out.  
不久后，美里驶入自家车道，身后是孩子们兴奋的尖叫和欢呼。他们早已在最近的街角等候，手臂上挂满了气球和鲜花，随着车子一路追到那座古老的木屋前。明日香几乎无法打开车门，生怕推倒了谁。美里从没有欢呼者的一侧下车，迅速将孩子们赶开，以便明日香能够出来。

She was bombarded with children throwing their arms around her and their flowers into her arms. Feeling very moved by their love, Asuka took time to thank each child for their flowers and balloons; by the time she had finished, Misato joked that there were enough balloons to carry her up into the air when she held them all.  
她被孩子们紧紧拥抱，鲜花纷纷抛入怀中。深受他们爱意的感动，明日香花时间向每个孩子致谢，感谢他们的鲜花和气球；等到她结束时，美里开玩笑说，如果她同时抓住所有气球，足以将她带上天空。

Kimie fell into step beside her as they made their way to the house, having wisely stayed out of the way while the younger children had their turn with Asuka first.  
她们走向房子时，君江明智地避开了，让年幼的孩子们先与明日香亲近。

"Welcome back, Asuka-san," she said, smiling.  
"欢迎回来，明日香小姐，" 她微笑着说。

Asuka tried to hug her and ended up spilling flowers all over her head.  
明日香试图拥抱她，结果把花撒了一头。

"Kimie," she asked quietly, after all the children had somehow gotten into the house (the situation had resembled trying to force many grains of corn into a narrow bottle opening at the same time), "Where's Shinji?"  
"君子，" 她在所有孩子不知怎么都进了屋后（那情景就像试图同时把许多玉米粒塞进一个窄瓶口），轻声问道，"真嗣在哪里？"

Kimie blinked and turned away, apparently afraid of revealing something.  
纪美眨了眨眼，转过身去，显然是害怕泄露什么。

"You'll see." “你会看到的。”

Her words only increased Asuka's trepidation to the point where she was hesitant to enter the house. When her foot finally crossed the threshold that marked the beginning of Misato's wooden floor, the house was deathly silent.  
她的话只让明日香更加忐忑，以至于她犹豫是否要进屋。当她的脚终于跨过标志着美里木地板起点的门槛时，屋内死寂无声。

Asuka stopped, but Kimie's small hands found her back and pushed her into the kitchen.  
明日香停下了脚步，但君子那双小手却找到了她的后背，将她推进了厨房。

He was standing with his back to her, bent over the counter. From the back she could see that he was wearing Misato's apron, tied crudely—one side seemed to droop much more than the other.  
他背对着她站在那里，弯腰伏在台面上。从背后她能看出他穿着美里小姐的围裙，系得相当粗糙——一边似乎比另一边垂得更厉害。

He wasn't speaking to her. He wasn't even bothering to look at her or welcome her back. The hurt she had inflicted upon him rebounded to hit her tenfold.  
他没有对她说话。甚至懒得看她一眼或欢迎她回来。她对他造成的伤害，以十倍的力度反弹回她自己身上。

"Shinji?" she whispered quietly.  
"真嗣？" 她轻声细语地问道。

He stiffened, paused, then stood up straight and slowly turned around. In his hands was a large cake in the shape of Asuka's head. It was not a birthday cake and no candles were on it, but Shinji's face needed no firelight to brighten the smile on his face.  
他身体一僵，停顿了一下，然后挺直腰板，缓缓转过身来。他手中捧着一个巨大的蛋糕，形状酷似明日香的头。这不是生日蛋糕，上面也没有蜡烛，但真嗣的脸上无需火光便已洋溢着笑容。

"Welcome home, Asuka!" "欢迎回家，明日香！"

Asuka could only gape, as Shinji laughed with the children at her surprise. There was her head, the red hair taking up the majority of the space, and her features smiling up at them as Shinji placed it on the table. His eyebrows knotted suddenly, and all the children hushed as he asked, "Who made Asuka's other eye black?"  
"明日香只能目瞪口呆，看着真嗣和孩子们因她的惊讶而笑。她的头就在那里，红色的头发占据了大部分空间，她的面容微笑着朝向他们，真嗣将其放在桌上。他的眉头突然紧锁，所有的孩子都安静下来，他问道：“是谁把明日香的另一只眼睛弄成黑色的？””

Everyone burst into laughter, including Asuka herself. One eye was constructed out of blue frosting, but the other one was indeed black.  
所有人都爆发出笑声，包括明日香自己。一只眼睛是用蓝色糖霜做的，但另一只确实是黑色的。

"All right, let me through." Misato came through with a knife and sliced up the cake deftly. "Who wants Asuka's nose?"  
“好了，让我过去。”美里拿着刀子熟练地切开了蛋糕。“谁想要明日香的鼻子？”

Before long, all that remained was a wisp of sugary hair and the lower left quadrant of her face, and Kimie was kept busy wiping frosting off of Makoto's shirt. The boy grabbed a fistful of clean shirt and wiped his mouth. "Asuka-san, you and Shinji-kun are coming to play with us tomorrow, right?"  
"不久，只剩下她一缕甜甜的头发和左下脸颊，而纪惠忙着擦拭真琴衬衫上的糖霜。男孩抓起一把干净的衬衫擦了擦嘴。“明日香，你和真嗣明天会来和我们一起玩，对吧？””

Misato glanced at Shinji sharply, then looked away.  
美里锐利地瞥了真嗣一眼，然后移开了视线。

"Of course I will," Asuka smiled, having missed the glance. Shinji, on the other hand, looked a bit apprehensive. The redhead turned to him, worry washing over her young face. "What is it?"  
"“当然我会去，”明日香笑着说，没注意到那一瞥。而真嗣则显得有些忧虑。红发女孩转向他，稚嫩的脸上流露出担忧。“怎么了？””

"Well...my two weeks are up," he mumbled. When she continued to look confused, he added, "I'm scheduled to head back to America tomorrow morning."  
"嗯...我的两周期限到了，"他喃喃道。看到她依旧一脸困惑，他补充说，"我预定明天早上回美国。"

"No! Shinji-kun, don't leave us!" the children cried. Shinji smiled sadly.  
"不！真嗣君，不要离开我们！"孩子们哭喊着。真嗣苦涩地笑了笑。

"I'll try to come back from time to time and visit," he promised.  
"我会尽量抽时间回来看看大家的，"他承诺道。

Asuka was silent, her eyes cast down. Shinji freed himself from the cries of the children and looked at her with concern in his deep blue eyes.  
明日香沉默不语，目光低垂。真嗣从孩子们的哭声中挣脱出来，深蓝色的眼睛里满是关切地看着她。

"Are you all right?" he asked.  
“你还好吗？”他问道。

Asuka nodded, glancing up and forcing a smile on her face. Kimie once again took charge upon noticing that Shinji still looked worried, and began to ferry the children off to their respective homes.  
明日香点了点头，抬头瞥了一眼，勉强挤出一个微笑。注意到真嗣依旧忧心忡忡，君惠再次接过指挥权，开始将孩子们一个个送回家。

"But I want more cake!" Makoto shouted, his little shirt nearly bright red from the frosting.  
"但我想吃更多蛋糕！" 真琴大喊，他的小衬衫几乎被糖霜染成了鲜红色。

"Makoto! Stop that!" Kimie scolded. Shinji, however, shook his head and absentmindedly pushed it towards them.  
"真琴！别那样！" 君子责备道。然而，真琴摇了摇头，心不在焉地把蛋糕推向他们。

"Take it home. I can always make another one."  
"带回家吧。我随时可以再做一个。"

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

"Yes... yes... take it..."  
"是的... 是的... 拿去吧..."

Misato went to the kitchen and came back with a roll of clear wrap, then packaged up the cake and placed it in Makoto's sticky hands. Kimie turned to Shinji, bowed, and wished him a good trip.  
美里走到厨房，拿回一卷保鲜膜，将蛋糕包好，放在真琴黏糊糊的手中。君子转向真嗣，鞠了一躬，祝他旅途愉快。

"It was very nice to meet you," she said politely. Shinji gave both of them a hug (when Makoto backed away, there were two red handprints on the back of Shinji's white shirt); then Kimie led her brothers home.  
"很高兴见到你，"她礼貌地说道。真嗣给了他们俩一个拥抱（当诚退开时，真嗣的白衬衫背上留下了两个红色的手印）；然后君子领着她的兄弟们回家了。

Misato crossed her legs in front of her, using her arms to support her weight. "So you're really leaving tomorrow, Shinji-kun?"  
美里交叉双腿坐在前面，用双臂支撑着身体。"那么你真的明天就要走了，真嗣君？"

"Erm... yeah," Shinji replied, feeling very tongue-tied all of a sudden.  
"呃... 是的，"真嗣回答，突然间感到舌头打结。

The purple-haired woman shifted to one side so that she could use her free hand to brush back a stray lock of hair. "Any idea when you'll be coming back?"  
紫发女子侧身挪了挪，腾出空闲的手将一缕散落的头发撩回耳后。“你知道你什么时候回来吗？”

When. Not if. 是何时，而非是否。

"Maybe Christmas," he replied.  
“可能圣诞节吧，”他回答道。

When that failed to stir a conversation, Misato sat up fully. "I know this is Asuka's homecoming night, but it's also your last night in Japan. Shinji, why don't you decide how you want to spend it?"  
当这未能激起对话时，Misato 完全坐直了身子。“我知道这是 Asuka 的归家之夜，但这也是你在日本的最后一晚。Shinji，你何不决定你想如何度过它？”

"I don't have any ideas," he mumbled a bit too quickly, but when he saw Asuka's expression, he quickly changed it. "I want Asuka to be happy."  
“我没有什么主意，”他有些过快地咕哝道，但当他看到 Asuka 的表情时，他迅速改变了态度。“我希望 Asuka 能开心。”

Misato smiled in the darkness, glad that Shinji couldn't see her or he would have blushed redder than Asuka's hair. "Then, Asuka, what do you want to do?"  
Misato 在黑暗中微笑，庆幸 Shinji 看不见她，否则他会比 Asuka 的头发还要红。“那么，Asuka，你想做什么？”

"I want for all of us to go outside and split a watermelon," she responded smoothly.  
"我想我们大家都出去，一起分个西瓜，" 她流畅地回应道。

= = = = = = =

Misato stayed only a short while. She ate her share of the watermelon, then told Asuka and Shinji that she was tired and needed to catch up on sleep if Shinji intended to live through her drive tomorrow. However, that was only half of the truth: she wanted Shinji to have some time alone with Asuka before he left early the next morning. Misato groaned inwardly at the idea of getting up at three.  
美里只停留了片刻。她吃完了自己的那份西瓜，然后告诉明日香和真嗣她很累，需要补觉，如果真嗣想在明天的驾驶中活下来的话。然而，这只有一半是真话：她希望真嗣能在第二天清晨离开前，有时间单独和明日香相处。想到要凌晨三点起床，美里内心呻吟了一声。

Shinji did just that, but Asuka wasn't responding much.  
真嗣确实这么做了，但明日香并没有太多回应。

She had to apologize to him before he left, she knew. The thought frightened Asuka; she avoided looking at his face and chose to focus instead on a pebble by the watermelon serving as her seat.  
她知道，在他离开之前必须向他道歉。这个念头让明日香感到害怕；她避免直视他的脸，而是选择专注于作为她座位的那块西瓜旁边的一颗小石子。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

She spoke his name against her knees, and he missed the sound altogether. Asuka steeled herself and tried again.  
她对着膝盖念出他的名字，而他完全没有听到那个声音。明日香鼓起勇气，再次尝试。

"Yes?" "是的？"

"I'm sorry." "我很抱歉。"

Shinji swiveled around slowly, so that he could see her face. "For what?"  
真嗣缓缓转过身来，以便能看到她的脸。“为了什么？”

"I... I yelled at you... that day."  
"我... 那天我对你大喊大叫了。"

Shinji stared at her incredulously for a moment.  
真嗣难以置信地盯着她看了一会儿。

"I'm sorry," she repeated.  
"对不起，"她重复道。"

She was both confused and relieved to hear him chuckling softly.  
听到他轻声笑起来，她既感到困惑又感到宽慰。

"It doesn't matter," he said earnestly. "I don't blame you at all, Asuka. If anything, it's my fault for letting you go out there."  
“没关系，”他诚恳地说，“我一点也不怪你，明日香。如果真要说的话，是我让你出去的错。”

Asuka shook her head no, just happy that she had told him the truth—and that he wasn't angry with her. The world seemed to brighten up, then darkened again as she realized he was leaving tomorrow.  
明日香摇了摇头，只是庆幸自己告诉了他真相——而且他并没有生她的气。世界似乎变得明亮起来，但当她意识到他明天就要离开时，又再次暗淡下去。

Shinji was having similar thoughts. If only he didn't have to leave... He glanced at Asuka again and saw her looking sad again, despite her earlier smile. He was going to miss her so much.  
真嗣也有类似的念头。如果他不必离开就好了...他又瞥了一眼明日香，尽管她之前还微笑着，现在却再次显得悲伤。他会非常想念她。

He leaned closer, advancing slowly, ready to plant a soft kiss on her temple. Asuka didn't notice, still deep in thought... there were now only a few inches between his lips and her head—he could see the moonlight glistening on each hair—but she hadn't moved—  
他靠得更近了，缓缓前进，准备在她额头上轻轻一吻。明日香没有注意到，仍然沉浸在自己的思绪中...现在他的嘴唇和她头部之间只剩下几英寸的距离——他能看见月光在每一根头发上闪烁——但她没有动——

"Ack!" “啊！”

Asuka jumped, giving Shinji a faceful of hair. "What was that?"  
明日香一跃而起，让真治满脸都是她的头发。“那是什么？”

"What?" Shinji asked, suddenly afraid he'd hurt her although he hadn't even touched her.  
“什么？”真治问道，突然害怕自己伤害了她，尽管他甚至都没碰过她。

"That." Asuka pointed to the dark woods, and sure enough, a soft rustle followed. "Can we go inside?"  
“那个。”明日香指向昏暗的树林，果然，随后传来一阵轻微的沙沙声。“我们能进屋吗？”

"Of course." They hurried inside, Shinji lingering on the doorstep to glance backwards.  
“当然。”他们匆匆进屋，真嗣在门口徘徊，回头一瞥。

The woods were now silent.  
此刻，树林中一片寂静。

= = = = = = =

The words escaped Keiichi's lips as a muffled, whispered scream.  
这些话从圭一的唇间逸出，化作一声低沉的、耳语般的尖叫。

"MAKOTO!" "真琴！"

"Sorry," the younger brother apologized, but drew only a frustrated sigh from his companion.  
"对不起，"弟弟道歉道，却只换来同伴的一声叹息。

Keichii, several years older, stepped a bit closer, cleverly avoiding any twigs that were liable to snap. He reached out and pulled aside a branch, revealing the glowing lights of Misato-san's house. "They've gone inside," he muttered. "Nice job, Makoto."  
几年年长的圭一稍微靠近了些，巧妙地避开了可能折断的树枝。他伸出手，拨开一根树枝，露出了美里家的灯光。"他们已经进去了，"他低声说。"干得好，真琴。"

"I can't see—" "我看不见——"

But what Makoto couldn't see, they never did find out. More crackling leaves made both of them jump and alerted them to the presence of a third person.  
但真琴看不见的东西，他们始终没有找到答案。更多的枯叶声让两人都跳了起来，并提醒他们有第三个人的存在。

"What do you think you're doing?!"  
"你以为你在干什么？！"

"RUN!" Keichii yelled, and the two set off at a run towards their home, Kimie chasing at their heels.  
"跑！" 圭一喊道，两人便朝着家的方向疾跑，君子紧随其后追赶。

= = = = = = =

"Goodnight, Asuka." "晚安，明日香。"

"Goodnight," she replied softly. She wanted to know what time he would be leaving the next day, but perhaps that would be too direct.  
"晚安，" 她轻声回应。她想知道他明天几点离开，但或许那样问太直接了。

Shinji concentrated on her sapphire blue eyes, then looked away. "I'll miss you," he said at last, then quickly added, "Hopefully I'll see you again soon."  
真嗣凝视着她那蓝宝石般的眼眸，随后移开了视线。“我会想你的，”他终于说道，随即迅速补充，“希望不久后能再见到你。”

I'll miss you too. 我也会想你的。

The words welled up in Asuka's throat but she choked them back, not yet ready to say them to him. Instead she nodded, looked at him for what seemed like an eternity before blushing and disappearing into her room. The door slid shut behind her.  
这些话涌上了明日香的喉咙，但她强忍着没有说出口，还没有准备好对他说。相反，她点了点头，凝视着他，仿佛过了一个世纪，然后脸颊泛红，消失在自己的房间里。门在她身后悄然滑上。

Shinji, on the other hand, found paper and pencil and roughly scribbled a few words in Japanese, then shoved the note under Misato's door.  
另一方面，真嗣找到了纸和笔，粗略地用日语写了几个字，然后将纸条塞进了美里房间的门下。

Asuka wasn't in the mood to shower or even brush her teeth. She turned off the light and crawled into bed, trying to block Shinji's face out of her mind.  
明日香没有心情洗澡，甚至连刷牙都不想。她关掉灯，爬上床，试图将真嗣的脸从脑海中抹去。

Perhaps I should have just told him.  
也许我应该直接告诉他。

Shyly, stealthily, she crept out of bed and slid open the door. But Shinji was already gone, his snores clearly audible from the living room. Asuka shut the door again and returned to bed.  
她羞涩而悄悄地从床上爬起，轻轻拉开房门。但真嗣已经不在了，他的鼾声清晰可闻，从客厅传来。明日香再次关上门，回到床上。

= = = = = = =

Misato jumped awake at the alarm, then punched the sleep button. Why the hell is it ringing now? It's still dark out!  
听到闹钟声，美里猛地惊醒，随即按下贪睡按钮。这该死的闹钟，现在响什么？外面还一片漆黑呢！

Shinji. He's going to be late!  
真嗣。他要迟到了！

Misato jumped out of bed and stumbled towards the doorway. Her left foot landed on the note Shinji had left; when she tried to walk, the paper slid across the carpet and she fell, hitting her head against the wooden door.  
美里从床上跳起来，踉跄着走向门口。她的左脚踏在了真嗣留下的纸条上；当她试图行走时，纸条在地毯上滑过，她摔倒了，头撞在了木门上。

I'll kill whoever put that there, she grumbled.  
"不管是谁放的那东西，我一定要杀了他。" 她咕哝着。

Misato fumbled in the darkness for a table lamp—when the room was sufficiently illuminated, she held the note close to her eyes. It read:  
美里在黑暗中摸索着找台灯——当房间足够亮时，她把纸条凑近眼睛。上面写着：

Don't wake Asuka. 别吵醒明日香。

Misato figured that she was probably awake from the blaring alarm clock and the unnaturally loud sound her head had caused when it made contact with the door, but after she dressed and went into the hallway, she could hear no sound from Asuka's room.  
美里猜想她可能已经被刺耳的闹钟和头撞门时异常响亮的声音吵醒了，但当她穿好衣服走进走廊时，却听不到明日香房间里传来任何声响。

"Misato-san." Shinji was already dressed, his bags packed and ready. "I made breakfast."  
“美里小姐。”真嗣已经穿戴整齐，行李也打包好了。“我做了早餐。”

Misato stumbled to the table, still unstable on her feet, sat down, and began to wolf down the food. Exactly twelve minutes later the fork fell from her hand and the former Major made her way outside, feeling a bit better now.  
美里踉跄地走向餐桌，脚步依旧不稳，坐下后便开始狼吞虎咽。整整十二分钟后，叉子从她手中滑落，这位前少校起身走向门外，感觉现在好些了。

It was still night outside, various stars blinking in the dark sky. An owl hooted in the trees and Misato shivered. Even after watching Angels disemboweled on a near-daily basis, she did not like the idea of birds that tore other animals to bits before eating them. She lowered herself into the driver's side of the car and closed her eyes while Shinji loaded his bags into the back.  
外面仍是夜晚，繁星在夜空中闪烁。树丛中传来猫头鹰的叫声，美里打了个寒颤。即便几乎每天都在目睹使徒被开膛破肚，她依然不喜欢那些在进食前撕碎其他动物的鸟类。她坐进驾驶座，闭上眼睛，而真嗣则将行李装进后座。

They hardly spoke all the way, mainly because Misato was half asleep and Shinji just hoped that they wouldn't hit something along the way.  
一路上他们几乎没有交谈，主要是因为美里半睡半醒，而真嗣只希望他们不会在路上撞到什么东西。

"Youreallylikerdunyou?" "你真的很喜欢她，对吧？"

"What?" Shinji asked, startled at the string of incomprehensible words. Misato pulled into a parking spot, yawned, and repeated, "You really like her, don't you?"  
"什么？" 真嗣问道，被这一串难以理解的话语吓了一跳。美里停好车，打了个哈欠，重复道："你真的很喜欢她，对吧？"

Shinji flushed. Misato smiled. "Sorry, didn't mean to embarrass you."  
真嗣脸红了。美里笑了笑。"抱歉，不是故意让你难堪的。"

"I thought I might write to her," Shinji started shyly, "but I didn't know the address." He reached into the back of the car and began pulling out his bags.  
"我想我可以给她写信，" 真嗣羞涩地开口，"但我不知道地址。" 他伸手到车后座，开始拿出自己的行李。

Misato waited patiently while Shinji produced a pen and paper, then scribbled down her address. "She'll be glad to hear from you, I know," she said quietly. "Take care, Shin-chan."  
美里耐心等待，直到真嗣拿出笔和纸，然后匆匆写下她的地址。"她会很高兴收到你的消息，我知道，" 她轻声说道，"保重，真嗣君。"

Shinji nodded. "You too." He slammed the car door shut. "Misato-san, thank you for everything."  
真嗣点点头。"你也是。" 他用力关上车门。"美里小姐，谢谢你的一切。"

Misato smiled. It was suddenly very hard to let Shinji go, and she regretted not having spent more time with him in the days he was here. The harsh words she had spoken to him while Asuka was in the hospital—if she had bothered to acknowledge him at all—came back to hurt her.  
美里微笑着。突然间，让真嗣离开变得异常艰难，她后悔在他在这里的日子里没有花更多时间陪伴他。在明日香住院期间，她对他说过的那些严厉的话——如果她当时有注意到他的话——现在回想起来让她感到心痛。

"Come back to us soon, Shinji."  
“早点回来，真嗣。”

Shinji nodded and glanced at his watch, tilting it in order to catch the moonlight. "I've got to go," he said. "Bye, Misato."  
真嗣点点头，瞥了一眼手表，为了捕捉月光而倾斜着。“我得走了，”他说，“再见，美里。”

He's all big and grownup now, a businessman, Misato thought proudly. Shinji Ikari walked with his back straight, one bag hanging over his shoulder and the other sliding along smoothly on wheels, the handle in his other hand. Upon reaching the door he turned around and waved one last time, then disappeared into the airport.  
他现在高大成熟，是个商人了。"美里自豪地想着。真嗣·碇挺直了背，一个包挂在肩上，另一个包则顺畅地拖在轮子上，把手握在另一只手中。到达门口时，他转过身来最后一次挥手，然后消失在机场中。

Misato came back to her car and fell fast asleep then and there, cramped in the driver's seat.  
美里回到她的车里，随即就在驾驶座上蜷缩着睡着了。

= = = = = = =

Asuka was the luckiest of the three that day. When she woke, the sun was up, and light was streaming in through her window. What was not so pleasant, however, was the dry, bitter taste in her mouth. She crawled up from her cot on the floor and noticed a piece of paper on the floor. It was in Misato's hand.  
那天，明日香是三人中最幸运的。当她醒来时，太阳已经升起，阳光透过窗户洒进来。然而，不那么愉快的是她嘴里干涩苦涩的味道。她从地板上的小床上爬起来，注意到地上有一张纸条。那是美里留下的。

Dropped Shinji off at airport. Gone back to sleep.  
把真嗣送到机场了。回去继续睡。

He's really gone. 他真的走了。

The thought made Asuka want to crawl back into bed—and she would have done so had a small glint of gold beside her bed not caught her attention. She gasped in surprise—it was a gold locket, in the shape of a tiny heart—and had her name cut across it diagonally, the letters in cursive. Beneath it was a note.  
这个念头让明日香想爬回床上——如果不是床边一抹小小的金色吸引了她的注意，她可能真的就这么做了。她惊讶地倒吸一口气——那是一个心形的小金坠，上面斜斜地刻着她的名字，字母是连笔的。下面还有一张纸条。

Asuka, 明日香，

I picked this up a few days ago. I thought you would like it.  
几天前我买了这个。我想你会喜欢的。

Shinji 真嗣

Asuka read it once, twice, and then again before flipping it over, hoping for some more words from him. There were none. She held the locket up to the light again.  
明日香一遍又一遍地读着，然后翻过来，期待着他的更多话语。然而什么也没有。她再次将项链举到光下。

"Liar," she whispered. "You didn't just pick this up." Her name testified to the fact that he had specially ordered it—and furthermore, that he cared for her.  
“骗子，”她低声说，“你不是随便捡来的。”她的名字证明了这是他特意订购的——而且更进一步，表明他在乎她。

The clasp was intricate and nothing like Asuka had ever seen before. One end was cut to look like a maple leaf, while the other had a loop that could be opened. The end with the maple leaf was slid through and the loop closed. The maple leaf would then keep the chain from sliding out, ensuring that the two ends stayed together.  
扣环精致复杂，是明日香从未见过的。一端被切割成枫叶形状，而另一端则有一个可以打开的环。枫叶端穿过环，然后闭合。枫叶会防止链条滑出，确保两端始终相连。

Asuka place it around her white neck and ran to the window. Outside a group of children were running and chasing a ball, when one of them stopped and pointed to the sky.  
明日香将它围在她的白皙脖颈上，跑向窗户。外面一群孩子在奔跑追逐着球，其中一人停下脚步，指向天空。

"Airplane!" he yelled. “飞机！”他喊道。

Asuka followed his gaze and saw the elegant shape gliding through the sky.  
明日香顺着他的目光望去，看到了那优雅的形状在天空中滑翔。

Perhaps Shinji's on that plane, thinking of me now.  
也许真嗣就在那架飞机上，此刻正想着我。

Author's notes: Added a bit of romance... well, maybe more like a lot of it. And I have to apologize for the terrible description of the clasp on Shinji's locket; I have a similar necklace but don't know how to describe it. Anyway, drop me a review... thanks so much to everyone who's done so!  
作者的话：增加了一些浪漫元素……嗯，或许应该说是很多。另外，我得为真嗣项链扣的糟糕描述道歉；我有一条类似的项链，但不知道如何描述它。无论如何，欢迎留下评论……非常感谢所有已经留下评论的朋友们！

### Chapter 13: Starfruit Ice Cream  
第十三章：杨桃冰淇淋  

She loved the jingling of little golden bell on the door of the ice cream parlor as she opened it. Asuka turned and waved to Misato, who smiled before pressing down on the accelerator. The blue car shot out of sight.  
她喜欢推开冰淇淋店门时，那小巧金铃铛发出的清脆响声。明日香转身向美里挥手，美里微笑着踩下油门，蓝色轿车疾驰而去，消失在视线中。

"Ohayoo, Asuka." "早上好，明日香。"

"Hey," Asuka greeted Madoka, her fellow employee, who was already busy at work adding sugar to her latest batch of ice cream. She glanced at the clock. There were still thirty minutes until they were due to open. Asuka sidled over to her friend. "Do you need any help?"  
"嘿，" 明日香向同事麻衣打招呼，麻衣已经在忙着给她的最新一批冰淇淋加糖。她瞥了一眼时钟。离他们开门还有三十分钟。明日香悄悄走到朋友身边。"需要帮忙吗？"

Madoka paused and looked up, her face pink from the exertion of stirring the mixture by hand. "Would you mind writing up today's special on the board?"  
麻衣停下手中的搅拌，抬头看向明日香，她的脸因用力搅拌而泛红。"你能帮忙写一下今天的特价品在黑板上吗？"

"Sure." "当然。"

Asuka donned a dark red apron and crossed the black-and-white checkered floor to the east wall, where a large dry-erase board was hanging out of her reach. She stood up on a chair and pulled it down, removing the markers and eraser located conveniently at the bottom.  
明日香系上深红色的围裙，穿过黑白格子相间地板，走向东墙，那里挂着一块她够不着的大白板。她站到椅子上，将其拉下，顺手取下了底部方便放置的马克笔和橡皮。

"What's the special?" “今天的特色是什么？”

"Starfruit." “杨桃。”

Asuka paused in erasing yesterday's special and looked up at Madoka. "Starfruit ice cream?"  
明日香在擦掉昨天的特制菜单时停了下来，抬头看向麻衣。“星果冰淇淋？”

"Yes, I did some experimenting yesterday and it came out quite nice. Come over and I'll get you some after I finish making this."  
“是的，我昨天做了些实验，效果相当不错。过来吧，等我做完这个就给你来一份。”

"All right." “好的。”

Five minutes later the board had been replaced, now bearing the words "Today's Special: Starfruit" in strawberry pink kanji. Asuka had packaged and frozen the new batch while Madoka made a starfruit cone for Asuka. The redhead licked it tentatively, then took a bigger bite and let the fruity taste spread over her tongue.  
五分钟后，黑板已被更换，现在上面用草莓粉色的汉字写着“今日特供：星果”。明日香在麻衣制作星果甜筒的同时，已经将新一批冰淇淋打包并冷冻好。红发的她小心翼翼地舔了一口，然后大口咬下，让果香在舌尖蔓延开来。

"It's good," she complimented. Madoka smiled, her anxious features relaxing. Asuka took another lick and added, "Akamatsu-san is really lucky to have you working here."  
"很好吃，"她称赞道。Madoka 微笑着，紧张的神情放松下来。Asuka 又舔了一口，补充说："有你在，赤松先生真是幸运。"

Madoka blushed, her dark shoulder-length hair contrasting with her pink cheeks. She was pure Japanese, twenty-one, and a student at Toudai University who worked during the summer to pay for her tuition. Asuka liked her; she was witty, accepting, and an avid ice-cream lover. The fact that Asuka was five years older than her made no difference; after all, Asuka had only started working here three weeks ago, and she had been here for several months.  
Madoka 脸红了，她那乌黑的齐肩发与粉嫩的脸颊形成鲜明对比。她是纯正的日本人，二十一岁，是东大的学生，暑假打工支付学费。Asuka 喜欢她；她机智、包容，还是个冰淇淋爱好者。尽管 Asuka 比她大五岁，但这并不重要；毕竟，Asuka 才在这里工作了三周，而她已经来了几个月。

Asuka, on the other hand, had finally gotten tired of staying home with nothing to do every day while Misato was at home; plus, it was nice to have something to do with her hands again. She'd passed the "Help Wanted" sign outside the nearby ice cream parlor while shopping with Misato, and had come back the next day to apply. Madoka had quickly accepted her as a close friend, and the boss, Akamatsu-san, had kindly entrusted her training to the Japanese girl. These days Asuka washed tables, swept the floor, and helped to sell and make ice cream—her favorite part.  
另一方面，Asuka 终于厌倦了每天无所事事地待在家里，而 Misato 在家的时候；此外，再次有事情做也挺好的。她和 Misato 购物时经过附近一家冰淇淋店的"招聘"招牌，第二天就回来应聘了。Madoka 很快接纳她为密友，老板赤松先生也亲切地将她的培训交给了这位日本女孩。如今，Asuka 负责擦桌子、扫地，还帮忙卖和制作冰淇淋——这是她最喜欢的工作。

Madoka knew little about her and asked little; she herself had a baseball player boyfriend who would stop by every now and then to grab a cone and give his girl a hug. Seeing the two together would inevitably make Asuka pine for Shinji; she would usually excuse herself to make more ice cream in the back room, whether it was needed or not. Madoka knew only that there was a potential guy for Asuka currently living in America who had given her the gold locket she always wore.  
对于她，真希波知之甚少，也不多问；她自己有个棒球手男友，时不时会来店里买个甜筒，给女友一个拥抱。看到两人在一起，总会让明日香不由自主地思念真嗣；她通常会借口去后厨做更多的冰淇淋，不管是否真的需要。真希波只知道，明日香有一个可能的恋人目前住在美国，那个男人送给她一条她总是佩戴的金色吊坠。

Asuka finished off her ice cream and unconsciously put a hand to the locket, teasing it in her fingers. Misato had found a picture of Shinji and shrunk it so that it would fit in the heart-shaped bauble.  
明日香吃完冰淇淋，下意识地用手抚摸着吊坠，用手指轻轻拨弄。美里找到了一张真嗣的照片，并将其缩小，以便放入心形的装饰品中。

The bell jingled as a mother and three hungry kids walked in despite the "closed" sign, bringing Asuka out of her thoughts. Madoka smiled and greeted them warmly. The youngest replied with a wail that resounded against the walls.  
尽管挂着“已打烊”的牌子，一位母亲带着三个饥饿的孩子走进店里，铃声随之响起，打断了明日香的思绪。真希波微笑着热情地迎接他们。最小的孩子用一声响彻墙壁的哭声回应。

The mother glanced at the fresh words on the board. "Starfruit ice cream... that sounds good. I'll take seven."  
母亲瞥了一眼黑板上新鲜的字迹。“星果冰淇淋……听起来不错。我要七个。”

Madoka's eyes grew wide, but she didn't say anything as she keyed in the order. Asuka hurried to the back and made seven starfruit ice cream cones, bringing them to the front two at a time. Several minutes later, the mother herded out her children, each silenced by a twin pair of cones. In one hand she held her own, licking freely now that the kids were no longer bothering her.  
麻衣的眼睛瞪大了，但她什么也没说，只是输入了订单。明日香急忙到后面做了七个星果冰淇淋甜筒，一次拿两个到前面。几分钟后，母亲带着孩子们离开了，每人嘴里都塞着一对甜筒，安静了下来。她一只手拿着自己的那份，孩子们不再打扰，她便自在地舔了起来。

"We're not really due to open for another fifteen minutes," Asuka chided.  
“我们其实还要再过十五分钟才开门，”明日香责备道。

Madoka smiled mischievously. "I couldn't help but feel sorry for her, with all those kids. Hopefully they'll quit bothering her for awhile."  
Madoka 调皮地笑了。“我忍不住为她感到难过，那么多孩子。希望他们能消停一会儿。”

Asuka smiled. She could always count on Madoka to be sweet and compassionate. However, at that moment the door jingled again as a tall, muscular baseball player swaggered in. Asuka muttered an apology about peach ice cream and hurried to the back, one hand pressed over the locket.  
Asuka 微笑了。她总是可以依靠 Madoka 的甜美和同情心。然而，就在这时，门铃再次响起，一个高大健壮的棒球运动员大摇大摆地走了进来。Asuka 低声道歉说要去拿桃子冰淇淋，急忙走向后面，一只手按在项链上。

= = = = = = =

"I'm home." “我回来了。”

"Welcome." Misato was at the stove, stirring and tasting as she worked. A wonderful smell drifted from the pot to Asuka's nostrils as she kicked off her shoes.  
“欢迎。”美里在炉子旁，边搅拌边品尝。一股诱人的香气从锅里飘出，钻进了明日香的鼻孔，她踢掉了鞋子。

It was still odd to come home after a day of work, for several reasons. She'd always been the one cooking dinner when Misato or Shinji came home. She'd never wanted to kick off her shoes and eat—then sleep—and get up and do it all over again. And she'd never felt so satisfied with her life.  
下班后回家仍然感觉很奇怪，原因有很多。她一直是那个在美里或真嗣回家时做饭的人。她从未想过踢掉鞋子，吃饭——然后睡觉——再起床重复这一切。而且她从未对自己的生活感到如此满足。

She thought of the calendar in the room she shared with Misato and reminded herself to cross off the date, although there was no need—the page was covered in large red X's. Days she'd spent thinking of Shinji. Days that had been devoid of news from Shinji.  
她想起了和美里共用的房间里的日历，提醒自己要划掉今天的日期，尽管没有必要——那一页上已经布满了大大的红叉。那些她思念真嗣的日子。那些没有真嗣消息的日子。

She ate her dinner slowly, savoring the taste, washing away the flavor of starfruit. The ice cream had been an instant hit; Madoka had had to make several more batches before the morning was over. Even Akamatsu-san declared he'd never seen the parlor so full; children were sitting on the floor and the line stretched a good distance outside. Asuka offered him a cone; he pronounced it the best ice cream Tokyo-3 had ever seen. Madoka was planning to package it and sell it by the gallon, if she and Asuka could ever keep up with the demand.  
她慢慢地享用晚餐，细细品味，洗去星果的味道。冰淇淋一推出就大受欢迎；麻子不得不在早晨结束前又做了好几批。就连赤松先生也宣称从未见过店里如此爆满；孩子们坐在地上，队伍一直排到了门外很远。明日香递给他一个甜筒；他称赞这是第三新东京市有史以来最好吃的冰淇淋。麻子计划将其包装成桶装出售，如果她和明日香能跟上需求的话。

It wasn't the money that made Asuka happy, although the income she brought in did lessen the stress on Misato a bit. She loved the excitement of lunchtime and early afternoon, when children were hot and tired from playing, and she loved the smell and taste of freshly made ice cream. Most of all she liked knowing she was useful and that her work was productive.  
让明日香感到快乐的并非金钱，尽管她赚的钱确实减轻了美里的一些压力。她喜欢午餐时间和午后，那时孩子们玩得又热又累，她喜欢新鲜制作的冰淇淋的香气和味道。最重要的是，她喜欢知道自己是有用的，她的工作是有成效的。

When she came home, however, her thoughts would turn to the small family she belonged to: Misato—and Shinji. She knew he had asked Misato for her address, had wanted to write, but there had been nothing. Asuka comforted herself each night hoping that perhaps he had written but the letter had been lost. Or maybe he couldn't read Misato's handwriting—far more likely, given that she had written it in the dark and was half asleep. Anything was better than the thought that he had simply not written—and she shivered—forgotten about her.  
然而，当她回到家时，她的思绪总会转向她所属的小家庭：美里——还有真嗣。她知道他曾向美里要过她的地址，想要写信，但什么都没有。每晚，明日香都安慰自己，也许他写了信但信件丢失了。或者他可能看不懂美里的笔迹——考虑到美里是在黑暗中半睡半醒时写的，这更有可能。任何事情都比想到他根本没有写信——她颤抖着——忘记了她要好。

"Misato," she said smoothly, putting down her fork, "there wasn't anything in the mail, was it?"  
"美里，"她平静地说，放下叉子，"邮件里没有什么东西吧？"

Her voice was cool and composed, the words indirect, but Misato knew what she meant. She'd been asking every day since his departure. Sadly she shook her head. Asuka nodded acceptingly, then turned back to her meal.  
她的声音冷静而镇定，话语间接，但美里明白她的意思。自从他离开后，她每天都这样问。美里悲伤地摇了摇头。明日香点头接受，然后转回继续用餐。

Misato watched her sharply, wondering as well why Shinji had not written. It was well over a month since had left; surely he could have at least informed her that he had arrived safely. Perhaps he needed a little prodding, she thought mischievously. Those thoughts faded quickly as she realized she hadn't bothered to ask for his address.  
美里锐利地注视着她，同样好奇真嗣为何没有写信。他已经离开一个多月了；按理说至少该通知她一声平安抵达。或许他需要一点推动，她狡黠地想。但这些念头很快消散，因为她意识到自己甚至没费心去问他的地址。

The doorbell rang. 门铃响了。

Asuka excused herself and went to go get it. Kimie was at the door, with Makoto and Keiichi. She called for Misato, who quickly cleared up and brought out a knife. Then the five went to the backyard for watermelons.  
明日香找了个借口起身去开门。纪美子站在门口，身边是诚和圭一。她喊来美里，美里迅速整理了一下，拿出一把刀。随后五人前往后院切西瓜。

"These stupid watermelons are growing faster than we can eat," Misato complained. "Sometime I'd like to have a backyard that's actually flat and not filled with green lumps."  
"这些该死的西瓜长得比我们吃的还快，"美里抱怨道。"有时候我真希望后院能平坦些，而不是到处都是这些绿疙瘩。"

Kimie, Makoto, and Keiichi laughed, but Asuka only smiled. She knew Misato would never get rid of the watermelons; it was practically all she had left of Kaji. She knew now whom those masculine clothes in the back of the closet belonged to.  
君子、真琴和圭一都笑了，但明日香只是微笑。她知道美里永远不会放弃这些西瓜；这几乎成了她对加持的全部回忆。她也终于明白衣柜深处那些男装属于谁了。

"We tried to stop by for ice cream," Kimie told Asuka, "but there were so many people that we didn't have time to stay in line."  
"我们本想顺路去买冰淇淋，"君子告诉明日香，"但人太多了，我们没时间排队。"

Asuka told her about Madoka's new experiment. Makoto's eyes grew wide and he asked, "What's a starfruit?"  
明日香向她讲述了麻美的新实验。真琴的眼睛瞪得大大的，问道：“星形果是什么？”

Asuka attempted to explain but the boy failed to understand how any fruit could look like a star. Keiichi, however, noted that Misato was looking wistfully at her field of fruit, and asked, "Asuka-san, have you ever tried making watermelon ice cream?"  
明日香试图解释，但男孩无法理解任何水果怎么可能长得像星星。然而，圭一注意到美里正若有所思地看着她的果园，便问道：“明日香小姐，你有没有试过做西瓜冰淇淋？”

"No," Asuka was forced to admit, a smile blooming over her face, "but I believe I will tomorrow!"  
“没有，”明日香不得不承认，脸上绽放出笑容，“但我相信我明天会试试的！”

= = = = = = =

Madoka's eyes were wide as saucers. "Asuka," she stammered, "What are you doing?"  
小圆的眼睛瞪得像铜铃一样大。“明日香，”她结结巴巴地说，“你在干什么？”

Asuka's face was red as she breathed heavily, hauling in a cartload of watermelons. "I thought we could try for watermelon ice cream," she said, smiling happily.  
明日香的脸涨得通红，她喘着粗气，拖着一车西瓜。“我想我们可以试试做西瓜冰淇淋，”她笑着开心地说。

Madoka smiled too. It was early in the morning and the sun had just barely risen, but already she was at work mixing up more starfruit ice cream. Several crates of starfruit lay stacked in the backroom. "I'm afraid it'll have to wait until we can keep up with this starfruit demand, Asuka—it looks like people are lining up outside already."  
小圆也笑了。清晨时分，太阳才刚刚升起，但她已经开始忙着调制更多的杨桃冰淇淋了。后屋里堆放着几箱杨桃。“恐怕我们得等到能跟上这杨桃需求的时候再说，明日香——看起来外面已经有人在排队了。”

"ALREADY?" Asuka flew to the front counter, her fingers grasping the edge. "But—but—we don't open for another two hours!"  
"已经来了？" 明日香飞奔到前台，手指紧紧抓住边缘。"但是——但是——我们还要两个小时才开门呢！"

Madoka shrugged, but her delighted grin showed her pleasure at their success. "I don't remember seeing him yesterday, either," she said thoughtfully. "News must be traveling fast." She sliced up another starfruit, peeled and seeded it, then threw the slimy pieces into a wide bowl. Asuka mixed eggs and cream and sugar, then poured it over the fruit. Madoka blended them in the old fashioned ice-cream maker—nothing could make ice cream as good as that old machine, which Akamatsu-san claimed had been a wedding present. Asuka emptied the finished product into gallon-sized buckets and placed them in the freezer. The cart of watermelons lay to the side, forgotten for the time being.  
麻美耸了耸肩，但她那得意的笑容显露出她的喜悦。"我昨天也没见过他，"她若有所思地说，"消息一定传得很快。"她切开另一个杨桃，去皮去籽，然后将这些滑溜溜的果肉扔进一个大碗里。明日香混合鸡蛋、奶油和糖，然后将其倒在水果上。麻美用那台老式冰淇淋机将它们搅拌在一起——没有什么能比那台旧机器做出更好的冰淇淋了，赤松先生声称那是他的结婚礼物。明日香将成品倒入加仑大小的桶中，放入冰箱冷冻。一车西瓜暂时被遗忘在旁边。

"Maybe we should open a bit earlier today?" Madoka voiced her concerns. Asuka glanced at her watch; it was still thirty minutes early. She told this to Madoka. "But that poor man's been standing outside for an hour and a half!" the Japanese girl cried.  
"也许我们今天应该早点开门？" 麻美表达了自己的担忧。明日香瞥了一眼手表；还早了三十分钟。她把这告诉了麻美。"但那个可怜的人已经在外面站了一个半小时了！" 日本女孩喊道。

Asuka shrugged. Madoka held off for another twenty minutes, then opened the door. A healthy crowd of people began to stream in. Among them were a tired Kimie and a bouncy Makoto.  
明日香耸了耸肩。麻美又拖延了二十分钟，然后打开了门。一群人开始涌入。其中有疲惫的君子和活泼的诚。

"He declared that he wasn't going to sleep until he got some of that ice cream," Kimie muttered, yawning. "I don't know where he gets his energy from."  
“他宣称不吃到那冰淇淋就不睡觉，”君子打着哈欠嘟囔道，“真不知道他的精力是哪儿来的。”

Asuka laughed and gave him an extra large scoop. His eyes grew wide as he tasted the sweet tangy flavor. "I want another one!"  
明日香笑着给了他一大勺。他尝到那甜中带酸的味道，眼睛瞪得大大的。“我还要一个！”

"Finish yours first," Kimie instructed as she took hers from Asuka's hands. "Thank you, Asuka-san."  
"先完成你的，" 纪惠从明日香手中接过自己的那份，说道，"谢谢你，明日香小姐。"

Asuka would have liked to chat, but the small parlor was echoing with booming business, and she had to hurry to tend to the next customer. Madoka came out of the room once, but Asuka shouted for her to keep making more ice cream, and she soon disappeared into the backroom again. Several hours later she emerged again, this time to relieve Asuka—it was time for her lunch break. Gratefully Asuka made her way into the backroom, her fingertips sore from hitting keys over and over again. Upon closing the door behind her she noticed the watermelons.  
明日香本想聊上几句，但小客厅里生意兴隆，回荡着喧闹声，她不得不赶紧去接待下一位顾客。真子曾出来过一次，但明日香大声让她继续做更多的冰淇淋，她很快就又消失在后台了。几个小时后，她再次出现，这次是为了接替明日香——该是她吃午饭的时间了。明日香感激地走进后台，她的指尖因反复按键而感到酸痛。关上门后，她注意到了那些西瓜。

Asuka bit into her apple as she sat down to think. She had helped Madoka many times to make ice cream, but never gone through the entire process herself. It couldn't be that hard, could it?  
明日香咬了一口苹果，坐下来思考。她曾多次帮助真子制作冰淇淋，但从未亲自完成整个过程。应该不会太难吧，她想。

Before Asuka knew it, she was slicing watermelon and picking out seeds with the tip of her knife. Juice and red frosty flesh went into the bowl; alone she mixed cream, eggs, and sugar, heating them as needed, then pouring it over the watermelon.  
不知不觉中，明日香已经开始用刀尖挑出西瓜籽，切着西瓜。汁水和冰凉的红色果肉落入碗中；她独自搅拌着奶油、鸡蛋和糖，根据需要加热，然后将其倒在西瓜上。

She was faced with a problem. There was far too much; it would not all fit in the ice cream machine at once. She would have to make two batches, perhaps three. Already her arms were tired; usually this part was Madoka's job. Asuka glanced in the corner and was pleased to see that there were still four empty buckets. Carefully she lifted the heavy bowl and poured into the open top of the ice cream machine. Asuka recapped the machine and began to crank, checking periodically to see if it was done or not.  
她面临一个问题。西瓜太多，一次装不下冰淇淋机。她得做两批，甚至三批。手臂已经感到疲惫；通常这部分是真琴的工作。明日香瞥了一眼角落，看到还有四个空桶，感到欣慰。她小心翼翼地抬起沉重的碗，倒入冰淇淋机的开口。明日香盖上机器，开始转动把手，不时检查是否完成。

It did take three batches to empty the bowl of watermelon and cream—and she had only cut one watermelon—but by then Asuka had gotten the hang of the machine, and she was pleased when she discovered the ice cream to be done the first time she checked. Now all that was left was to freeze it.  
确实需要三批才能清空西瓜和奶油的碗——而她只切了一个西瓜——但那时明日香已经掌握了机器的操作，当她第一次检查时发现冰淇淋已经完成，感到很高兴。现在剩下的就是冷冻它了。

Asuka finished cleaning up and ate the rest of her lunch quickly. Madoka appeared to bring in more ice cream, and the redhead offered to take her place.  
明日香迅速收拾完，快速吃完了剩下的午餐。真琴似乎是来拿更多冰淇淋的，红发女孩主动提出替她接手。

= = = = = = =

The sun had almost set—Madoka knew it was almost time to close up, but the crowd hadn't seemed to dwindle since the moment they had opened. Asuka had gone shopping for more heavy cream. She excused herself and ran to the backroom to bring another batch of starfruit ice cream.  
太阳几乎要落山了——真琴知道快到打烊的时间了，但自开门以来，人群似乎并未减少。明日香去采购了更多的高脂奶油。她道了声歉，跑进后室去拿另一批星果冰淇淋。

She paused thoughtfully in front of the freezer, its cold air biting her skin. There seemed to be more ice cream than she remembered. Perhaps she'd made more than she'd thought. Madoka suddenly felt grateful for the work she didn't remember doing; it would mean less work later. She grabbed one bucket and hurried back, apologizing for the delay.  
她在冰柜前若有所思地停下，冷气刺痛了她的皮肤。冰淇淋似乎比她记忆中的要多。也许她做得比自己想的还要多。真琴突然对那些她不记得做过的活儿感到感激；这意味着之后的工作会少一些。她抓起一桶，急忙赶回，为耽搁道歉。

"It looks awfully pink," the boy commented, looking a bit apprehensive. Madoka assured him that it couldn't have gone bad, as she had just made it that morning—and made him a fresh cone. The boy licked it once, twice, then three times—and suddenly pumped his fist in the air, shouting, "It's watermelon!"  
"看起来非常粉嫩，" 男孩评论道，显得有些担忧。小圆向他保证这不可能变质，因为她今早刚做好的——还给他现做了一个甜筒。男孩舔了一口，两口，然后三口——突然间挥拳欢呼，"是西瓜味的！"

"Watermelon?!" Madoka exclaimed. The boy's mother bent down and took a lick. Her eyes widened as she stood back up. "I'll have another one of those... and a gallon of it to go, as well."  
"西瓜味？！" 小圆惊呼。男孩的母亲弯下腰舔了一口。她站起身时眼睛瞪大了。"我还要再来一个... 外加一加仑带走。"

"A gallon..." Madoka's voice trailed off as she keyed in the order.  
"一加仑..." 小圆的声音逐渐减弱，她开始输入订单。

= = = = = = =

Madoka had closed up, ushered the final customers out, and was cleaning up melted ice cream when Asuka came in through the back door, carrying two large jugs of cream.  
麻美学姐已经打烊，送走了最后一批顾客，正在清理融化的冰淇淋时，飞鸟从后门走了进来，手里提着两大桶奶油。

"Sorry," she apologized. “抱歉，”她道歉道。

Madoka threw aside the mop and started to laugh. "For what? I believe you've found a flavor to topple starfruit."  
麻美扔下拖把，开始笑了起来。“为了什么？我相信你找到了一种能超越杨桃口味的冰淇淋。”

Asuka stood in utter incomprehension for several moments. Her apology had been to account for her tardiness—but—Madoka must have found the watermelon ice cream!  
明日香愣在原地，完全无法理解。她的道歉本是为了解释自己的迟到——但是——麻美一定是找到了西瓜味冰淇淋！

"Oh no!" Asuka cried out. "It hasn't been refrigerated long enough! Are you sure it was ready to eat?"  
"哦不！" 明日香惊呼道，"还没冷藏够时间呢！你确定它已经可以吃了吗？"

"We sold out in less than six minutes," Madoka informed her. "I think we have a new specialty to add to our board."  
"我们不到六分钟就卖光了，" 麻美告诉她，"我想我们得在菜单上新增一道特色了。"

Some of the fatigue lifted from Asuka's arms as she climbed up to remove the board. In large green characters she added "Watermelon."  
随着阿斯卡爬上去移开木板，她手臂上的疲惫感减轻了一些。她用大大的绿色字体加上了“西瓜”。

= = = = = = =

"I'm home." “我回来了。”

Misato glanced over her shoulder, a knowing smile on her face. "Hey, Asuka—"  
美里回头瞥了一眼，脸上带着会心的微笑。“嘿，阿斯卡——”

Asuka cut her off rather rudely. "Sorry, Misato. I think I'm going to skip dinner and go straight to bed tonight, if that's all right."  
明日香相当粗鲁地打断了她。“抱歉，美里。我想今晚跳过晚餐，直接去睡觉，可以吗？”

"Sure," the purple-haired woman answered, deciding not to tell Asuka what else she was missing out on. She'd appreciate it more when she was fully relaxed.  
“当然，”紫发女子回答道，决定不告诉明日香她还错过了什么。等她完全放松下来，她会更感激的。

Asuka sank onto her cot and slept. She didn't know when she woke up, but when her eyes opened again the room was dark and Misato was spread out on the cot beside her. Her throat was unusually dry. Asuka got out of bed, being careful not to wake Misato, and made her way to the kitchen.  
明日香沉沉地躺到自己的床上睡着了。她不知道自己何时醒来，但当她再次睁开眼时，房间一片漆黑，美里则摊开在旁边的床上。她的喉咙异常干燥。明日香小心翼翼地起床，以免吵醒美里，然后走向厨房。

She turned on the light, squinting at the brightness and placed one hand on the counter as she reached up with the other for a glass. Instead of the smooth, glossy wood she expected, Asuka's hand sensed paper. She glanced down to see a thick package whose stamp indicated it had come overseas—from America!  
她打开灯，眯着眼适应着亮度，一只手撑在柜台上，另一只手伸向一个玻璃杯。本以为会触到光滑的木质表面，但明日香的手却感受到了纸张的质感。她低头一看，发现是一个厚厚的包裹，邮戳显示它来自海外——美国！

Asuka grabbed the package and held it close to her face. The return address was unfamiliar, but the name at the top was: Shinji Ikari.  
明日香抓起包裹，凑近眼前细看。回邮地址很陌生，但顶端的署名却是：碇真嗣。

She tore it open and the contents fell to the floor. Asuka knelt down to pick it up, expecting a letter or photographs—but certainly not the magazine she found.  
她撕开包裹，里面的东西散落一地。明日香跪下身去捡拾，以为会是信件或照片——但绝没想到会是一本杂志。

The front cover portrayed a large water bird with pinkish wings and a spoon- like bill, which Asuka did not recognize. She opened to the first page and found that the picture was of a "Roseate Spoonbill", and the image was credited to Kensuke Aida.  
封面描绘了一只翅膀呈粉红色、喙部形似勺子的大型水鸟，但明日香并不认识。她翻到第一页，发现图片上的是一只“玫瑰琵鹭”，图片由真希波·真理·伊斯卡提供。

She remembered then—Shinji was the editor of a magazine for which Kensuke took pictures. Asuka flipped back to the cover and admired the grace of the large bird, despite its clumsy beak.  
她随即想起来——真嗣是一本杂志的编辑，而真希波负责拍摄照片。明日香翻回封面，欣赏着这只大鸟的优雅，尽管它的喙显得有些笨拙。

But why had Shinji sent her a magazine?  
但真嗣为什么要寄给她一本杂志呢？

Asuka shook it; no letters fell out. The envelope was empty when she checked.  
明日香摇了摇；没有信件掉出来。她检查时发现信封是空的。

There was nothing to do but return to the magazine. On the second page, however, was something that made her gasp.  
除了回到杂志上，别无他法。然而，在第二页上，有一样东西让她倒抽了一口气。

It was a photograph of her. She was standing on the front steps of Misato's house, gazing off into the distance. When had he taken this, without her noticing? Asuka peered closer and noticed a small row of letters at the bottom: the picture was credited to Misato Katsuragi!  
这是一张她的照片。她正站在美里家的前台阶上，凝视着远方。他是如何在不被她察觉的情况下拍下这张照片的？明日香凑近一看，注意到底部有一行小字：这张照片的署名是葛城美里！

"Misato?" "美里？"

But the photo did not cover the page. A long, typed letter in English spanned the rest of the page. It was a letter to her. And at the bottom was Shinji's signature.  
但照片并未覆盖整页。一封长长的、用英文打字的信占据了页面的其余部分。这是写给她的信。而在底部，是真嗣的签名。

Asuka wished her English were better—she had not exercised it in a long time—but nevertheless she read through the letter easily several times. He had arrived in California and missed her. Throughout the letter he mused about the experiences they had shared, and regretted that they could not have spent more time together. Asuka read through the last few lines several times—he was inviting her to America!  
明日香希望自己的英语能更好些——她已经很久没有练习过了——但尽管如此，她还是轻松地反复读了几遍这封信。他已经到达了加利福尼亚，并且想念她。整封信中，他都在回味他们共同经历的那些时光，并遗憾他们未能共度更多时光。明日香反复读了最后几行——他在邀请她去美国！

"I hope that someday you'll be able to come to California for a visit," the letter read. "There are so many things here that I would like to show you. The next time we meet..."  
“我希望有一天你能来加利福尼亚看看，”信中写道，“这里有很多我想向你展示的东西。下次我们见面时……”

Asuka was crying, smiling at the same time; her happiness and sadness clashed and blended as she held the magazine to her chest and fumbled with the locket again.  
明日香一边哭泣，一边微笑；她的快乐与悲伤交织融合，她将杂志紧抱在胸前，再次笨拙地摆弄着那个吊坠。

He remembered me. He's thinking of me. He wants me to come to see him.  
他记得我。他在想我。他想让我去看他。

Asuka wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and lay down on the kitchen floor, wanting to savor the moment. Several minutes later she was fast asleep, a happy smile blossoming on her face, the magazine clasped tightly in her arms.  
明日香用手背擦了擦眼睛，躺在厨房地板上，想要细细品味这一刻。几分钟后，她便沉沉睡去，脸上绽放出幸福的微笑，杂志紧紧地抱在怀里。

Author's note: A very odd chapter... I felt like this one revolved more around starfruit ice cream than Asuka and Shinji, sorry about that. Asuka's found something to do with herself for the time being, and Shinji's settled back into his life while still keeping her in the front of his mind.  
作者的话：这一章颇为奇特……感觉它更多围绕着杨桃冰淇淋而非明日香和真嗣，对此深表歉意。明日香暂时找到了自己的事情做，而真嗣则回归了他的生活，同时始终将她放在心上。

Last time I was asked if I happen to hate Rei. While I don't hate her, Rei has never appealed to me as much as Asuka; I don't think I could ever write a fic with her as a main character because I can't think in her mind at all. However, I do have a few plans for Rei in this fic, towards the end...  
上次有人问我是否讨厌绫波。虽然我不讨厌她，但绫波从未像明日香那样吸引我；我认为自己永远无法以她为主角写一篇同人，因为我完全无法揣摩她的心思。不过，在这篇同人中，我确实对绫波有一些后期的计划……

Thanks for reading! Drop me a review if you'd like.  
感谢阅读！如果愿意的话，请留下您的评论。

### Chapter 14: To America  
第十四章：前往美国  

"You're going to _America?_ Asuka, I'm so jealous!"  
“你要去美国？明日香，我好羡慕啊！”

Madoka was beaming at her, a wide smile gracing her face as she worked rapidly in the backroom. Asuka brought her another watermelon and waited, her hands folded on top of the fruit.  
真希波笑着对她说，脸上洋溢着灿烂的笑容，她在后台忙碌着。明日香又递给她一块西瓜，双手叠放在水果上等待着。

"_Madoka,_" she chided. "真嗣," 她责备道。

"It was so romantic of him to invite you in his magazine, where everyone could see it," Madoka mused dreamily. The handle cranked under the pressure of her strong hands. "How long will you be staying?"  
"他在杂志上邀请你，让所有人都能看到，真是太浪漫了，" 真嗣梦幻般地沉思着。她的强壮双手下，门把手在压力下转动。"你会停留多久？"

"About a week." Misato and Asuka had considered the length and decided seven days to be appropriate. "I don't want to become an inconvenience to him, especially in America...I hope my English is good enough."  
"大约一周。" 美里和明日香考虑了时间长度，决定七天是合适的。"我不想给他添麻烦，尤其是在美国...希望我的英语足够好。"

"I'm sure you'll be fine. Don't worry about it."  
"我肯定你会没事的。别担心。"

Asuka smiled. "It's time to open," she said, more to herself than her companion, and ran to hurry the door. Already the line was forming.  
明日香微笑着。“是时候开门了，”她更多是对自己说，而不是她的同伴，然后跑去加快开门的速度。队伍已经开始排起来了。

_I couldn't leave Madoka alone to run this place for much more than a week, anyway_, Asuka thought. She pushed the door open and the crowd outside began slowly to dissipate.  
无论如何，我不能让小圆一个人管理这个地方超过一周，明日香想。她推开门，外面的人群开始慢慢散去。

= = = = = = =

Misato held up the skirt, waiting eagerly for Asuka's approval. It was pale blue and pleated, covered with a pattern of mosaic-like pieces. The redhead took it from her hands and considered.  
美里提起裙摆，急切地等待着明日香的认可。这条裙子是淡蓝色的，褶皱间点缀着马赛克般的图案。红发少女从她手中接过，仔细端详。

"Try it on," Misato urged. "And here..." she plucked a blouse off of a nearby rack— "let's see how this will go with it."  
“试试看，”美里催促道，“还有这里……”她从附近的架子上取下一件衬衫——“看看这件搭配起来效果如何。”

Asuka dumped both pieces of clothing into the increasing pile in their shopping cart.  
明日香将这两件衣物扔进了购物车中不断增长的衣物堆里。

"I'll try everything on after we're done looking around," she insisted.  
“等我们逛完了，我会把所有衣服都试一遍。”她坚持道。

She had not been shopping in what seemed like—and really was—an eternity. Apart from her job, and an occasional visit to the city now and then with Misato, Asuka had not left the protective place she called home. Misato had bought clothes for her or she had worn Misato's, it didn't really matter. There was no one to dress up for; after all, Kimie and Makoto couldn't care less what she wore.  
她似乎已经很久——实际上也确实很久——没有购物了。除了工作，以及偶尔和美里一起去城里逛逛，明日香几乎没有离开过她称之为家的那个保护所。美里给她买衣服，或者她穿美里的衣服，这都无所谓。毕竟，没有人值得她打扮；毕竟，君惠和诚对她的穿着并不关心。

Asuka had been sincerely surprised at the amount of clothing in the department store. There were so many styles and fashions, each made in many different patterns and types of cloth. She had wanted to run around and examine everything, but eventually submitted to Misato's better judgment.  
明日香对百货公司里琳琅满目的服装数量感到由衷的惊讶。这里有如此多的款式和时尚，每一种都用许多不同的图案和布料制成。她本想四处奔跑，仔细查看每一件，但最终还是听从了美里更为明智的判断。

"We need to get you a nice evening dress," Misato was saying. "Maybe something black and strapless... come on, I see something of the sort over there."  
“我们得给你挑件漂亮的晚礼服，”美里说道，“或许黑色无肩带的款式不错……看，那边就有类似的。”

Asuka tagged alongside the purple-haired woman, who looked like a girl shopping for her first prom as she dug through the dresses.  
明日香跟在紫发女子身边，看着她像第一次参加舞会的女孩一样翻找着礼服。

Misato, too, had given up the excitement of shopping years ago. With Asuka and Shinji gone, there was no one to shop for. Who would she dress up for, now that Kaji was dead? The last time she could remember being happy about a purchase was when she had bought that purple dress for a wedding—that of a bride and groom whose names she could no longer remember.  
美里也早已放弃了购物的乐趣。自从明日香和真嗣离开后，她便无人可为其打扮。如今，加持已逝，她还能为谁盛装呢？她最后一次对购物感到开心，是在为一场婚礼买那件紫色礼服时——那对新人的名字，她已记不清了。

She held up the gown for Asuka's approval.  
她举起那件礼服，等待明日香的认可。

"Misato..." Asuka whispered, holding it up limply, "I don't know where all these straps go..."  
"美里..." 明日香低声说道，无力地举着它，"我不知道这些带子都该系在哪里..."

Misato's fervor was not dampened in the least. "I'll show you later," she said cheerfully, and pushed the cart along.  
美里的热情丝毫未减。"我稍后教你，"她愉快地说着，推着推车继续前行。

"Shouldn't we go try them on now?" Asuka questioned. The pyramidal pile was overflowing and several garments were in danger of falling over the side. Misato glanced at it, considered, and finally agreed.  
"我们现在不应该去试试这些衣服吗？" 明日香问道。金字塔般的衣堆已经溢出，几件衣物有从边缘滑落的危险。美里瞥了一眼，考虑了一下，最终同意了。

Unfortunately for them, there was a limit of eight garments per room—which meant Asuka had to make many more trips than she would have preferred. Misato waited outside beside the mounting pile of fabric as bypassers gave her odd looks. After each she had tried on each outfit, Asuka would step out, and together they would decide whether or not to buy it. Slowly a much smaller stack of feasible clothes began to appear.  
不幸的是，每个房间只能试穿八件衣物——这意味着明日香不得不比她希望的要多跑很多趟。美里站在外面，旁边是越堆越高的布料，路人纷纷向她投来奇怪的目光。每试穿完一套衣服，明日香就会走出来，然后她们一起决定是否购买。慢慢地，一堆更小但可行的衣服开始出现。

"All right, you can't put it off any longer," Misato grinned, holding up the black dress. "Go try it on."  
"好了，你不能再拖了，" 美里笑着拿起那件黑色连衣裙，"去试试吧。"

Asuka, who had been attempting futilely to shove it to the bottom of the pile, groaned. "I don't understand how..."  
明日香徒劳地试图将它塞到那堆东西的最底下，呻吟道：“我不明白怎么……”

Misato abruptly shushed her, whirled her around by the shoulders, and pushed her into the dressing room. Five minutes later Asuka emerged, appearing very elegant and classy.  
美里突然嘘了一声，抓住她的肩膀猛地转过身，把她推进了更衣室。五分钟后，明日香走了出来，显得非常优雅和有品位。

"You look nice," Misato told her honestly.  
“你看起来很漂亮，”美里真诚地对她说。

Asuka shifted uncomfortably. "There's way too much skin showing," she mumbled, coloring as she attempted to hide some of it. "There isn't even a back!"  
明日香不安地挪动着身体。“露出的皮肤太多了，”她咕哝着，脸红地试图遮住一些。“连后背都没有！”

While Misato attempted to fix that problem, a second dress caught Asuka's glance.  
当美里试图解决这个问题时，另一件礼服吸引了明日香的目光。

"Oh, Misato, look at this..."  
“哦，美里，看看这个……”

It was strapless, although slightly more covering than the backless style—and was made out of a silky, dark aqua fabric with matching sequins strewn across the upper half. Misato opened her mouth, ready to tell the redhead that it would clash horribly with her hair, but bit back her words when she saw the excitement on Asuka's face.  
这是一件无肩带款式，虽然比露背装稍微保守一些——由深海蓝色的丝滑面料制成，上半部分点缀着相配的亮片。Misato 张开嘴，准备告诉红发女孩这会和她头发严重不搭，但看到 Asuka 脸上的兴奋时，她咽回了那些话。

She had to admit she was surprised at the results. If anything, Asuka looked gorgeous—a girl any man would be proud of. The redhead stepped out barefoot, smiling broadly, and twirled in the mirror.  
她不得不承认，结果让她感到惊讶。如果说有什么不同的话，Asuka 看起来非常迷人——任何一个男人都会为她感到骄傲。红发女孩光着脚走出来，笑容满面，在镜子前旋转。  
_  
I never knew shopping was so much fun,  
我从来不知道购物这么有趣，_ she thought excitedly. 她兴奋地想道。

Misato, on the other hand, was busy imagining Shinji's face when he saw her. This was _it_, she thought, everything about the dress screamed Asuka's name—  
另一方面，美里正忙着想象真嗣看到她时的表情。她心想，就是这件了，这裙子的一切都在呼喊着明日香的名字——

"How much is it?" “多少钱？”

Asuka picked up the tag hanging off of the left sleeve—and blanched. Misato leaned over and felt her face turn a similar color.  
明日香拿起挂在左袖上的标签——顿时脸色煞白。美里凑过来，脸上也泛起了相似的颜色。

Asuka shrugged. "It doesn't matter. Even if I got it, I'd only wear it a few times in my life." She disappeared back into the fitting room, leaving Misato alone to her thoughts. Ten minutes later they emerged carrying four shopping bags, among which were the black dress, the pleated skirt, and the matching top.  
明日香耸了耸肩。“无所谓了。就算我买了，这辈子也只会穿几次。”她又消失在试衣间里，留下美里独自沉思。十分钟后，她们提着四个购物袋出来了，其中包括那件黑色连衣裙、百褶裙和配套的上衣。

The green dress remained on the rack.  
那件绿色连衣裙依旧挂在架子上。

She couldn't have hoped for a better reaction from Akamatsu-san. The old man seemed quite overly pleased, wishing her well and promising her own ice cream machine if she and her man "decided to get hitched". After much blushing on Asuka's part, Akamatsu-san wished her good luck yet again and promised her that her place in the ice cream parlor would always remain there for her.  
她本不敢奢望赤松先生会有更好的反应。这位老人似乎非常高兴，祝她一切顺利，并承诺如果她和她的男人“决定结婚”，就送她一台自己的冰淇淋机。在明日香满脸通红之后，赤松先生再次祝她好运，并承诺她在冰淇淋店的职位将永远为她保留。

She shared a last special moment with Madoka as they mixed the day's final batch of starfruit ice cream, which Madoka insisted she take home to share with Misato.  
她和真希波分享了最后一个特别的时刻，她们一起制作了当天最后一批星果冰淇淋，真希波坚持让她带回家与美里分享。

"Take lots of pictures," Madoka urged. "Not only of... Shinji..." the name was still slightly unfamiliar on her tongue—"...but of the scenery too."  
“多拍些照片，”真希波催促道，“不仅是……真嗣……”这个名字在她嘴里还是有点生疏——“……还有风景。”

"I will," Asuka promised. A car honked outside. Asuka picked up the bucket of ice cream and gave Madoka a quick hug. "Bye."  
"我会的，" 明日香承诺道。外面的汽车鸣笛声响起。明日香拿起那桶冰淇淋，迅速拥抱了真希波一下。"再见。"

Misato was up and on the phone with Shinji an hour before her usual waking time, wanting to catch him during an appropriate hour. Unfortunately, due to the different time zones, she could never be sure exactly where he was. He happened to be in a meeting, and she could tell he was none too pleased at being interrupted.  
美里比平时早一个小时起床，并给真嗣打电话，希望能在一个合适的时间联系到他。不幸的是，由于时差的关系，她无法确定他确切的位置。真嗣碰巧在开会，她能感觉到他被打断时非常不悦。

However, his tone immediately changed upon hearing about Asuka.  
然而，一听到明日香的消息，他的语气立刻变了。

"You'll be there to meet her?"  
"你会去接她吗？"

"Yes." Shinji paced around outside, thinking of the huge airport. "LAX is a pretty big place. I'll be meeting her right outside the gates."  
"是的。" 真嗣在外面走来走去，想着那个巨大的机场。"洛杉矶国际机场很大。我会在出口处接她。"

Misato ran over her mental checklist and decided all was fine. Asuka was packed and ready to go, so Misato cut off the call and opened up the backseat. Together they heaved her heavy suitcase into the back before climbing into the front.  
美里在心里过了一遍清单，确定一切都没问题。明日香已经打包好准备出发了，于是美里挂断电话，打开后座。他们一起把她的沉重行李箱抬到后座，然后爬进前座。

"Are you nervous?" Misato glanced sideways at her companion before swerving to avoid hitting a stray cat. The animal meowed angrily and scurried away.  
“你紧张吗？”美里侧头瞥了一眼同伴，随后急转避开一只流浪猫。那猫愤怒地喵了一声，迅速跑开了。

Asuka's hands were clenching tightly in her lap, fiddling with the strap of her carry-on. She forced them apart and replied honestly, "A little... I haven't traveled alone by myself at all."  
明日香的手紧紧抓着膝盖上的手提包带子，她强迫自己松开手，诚实地回答：“有一点……我从未独自旅行过。”

Misato nodded. Even she had never been to the United States; she had only visited Germany. On each of those trips she had traveled in a special Nerv jet. Nobody at Nerv had ever traveled in a commercial plane before.  
美里点点头。连她自己也没去过美国；她只去过德国。每次旅行都是乘坐 NERV 的专机。NERV 里从没有人坐过商业航班。

She noticed the blank expression on Asuka's face as the car pulled into the airport, and attempted to reassure her. The redhead nodded, the expression on her face not changing.  
当车驶入机场时，她注意到了明日香脸上的空白表情，并试图安慰她。红发女孩点了点头，脸上的表情依旧未变。

"I'll be with you every step of the way that I can, and Shinji's waiting at the other end," she promised.  
“我会尽我所能陪你走每一步，而且真嗣在另一头等着呢，”她承诺道。

Asuka smiled slightly at his name, something that Misato did not miss.  
听到他的名字，明日香微微一笑，这一点没有逃过美里眼睛。

Misato checked in her luggage and completed everything else for Asuka with little difficulty, while the redhead sat on a hard wooden bench and looked around. There were announcements going off constantly, each sending a flurry of people hurrying towards the security lines. Asuka watched curiously as each person placed his or her bags on a conveyor belt and walked through a doorframe. Occasionally it would beep and a light would flash red; then all would stop as the person was required to undergo a security check.  
美里轻松地办理了行李托运并为明日香完成了所有其他手续，而红发少女则坐在一张硬木长椅上四处张望。机场里不断响起各种广播，每一条都让一群人急匆匆地涌向安检通道。明日香好奇地看着每个人将自己的行李放在传送带上，然后走过一个门框。偶尔会有哔哔声响起，红灯闪烁；随后所有人都会停下来，等待那个人接受安检。

"All right, we're all ready." Misato's voice broke harshly into her thoughts. "Let's get in line."  
“好了，我们都准备好了。”美里的声音突然打断了她的思绪，“我们去排队吧。”

When her turn came, Asuka dutifully placed her bag on the conveyor belt and walked through the door anxiously. Nothing happened.  
轮到她时，明日香顺从地将包放在传送带上，紧张地走过门框。什么也没发生。

Misato, on the other hand, managed to set off both the alarm and light. The security officer drew her aside and ordered her to stand with her arms and legs apart as he swept over her body with some sort of detector. Asuka caught Misato giving him a disdainful glance and laughed.  
另一方面，美里设法触发了警报和灯光。安全官员将她拉到一旁，命令她张开四肢站立，然后用某种探测器在她身上扫过。明日香看到美里给了他一个轻蔑的眼神，不禁笑了起来。

The mechanism began to beep around her hips. Misato reached into the seemingly-flat pockets of her jeans and pulled out a set of metal keys. When the other pocket set off the beeping as well, she produced a handful of coins. Several more metallic objects made their appearance before the officer declared himself satisfied and set the purple-haired woman free.  
探测器在她腰间开始哔哔作响。美里伸手探入看似扁平的牛仔裤口袋，掏出了一串金属钥匙。当另一个口袋也触发警报时，她又掏出了一把硬币。在官员宣布满意并放走这位紫发女子之前，还有几样金属物品相继出现。

"Flight 284, from Tokyo-3, Japan, to Los Angeles, California, is now boarding."  
从日本东京-3 飞往加利福尼亚洛杉矶的 284 航班，现在开始登机。

"Do you want to get on now, or wait a little while?"  
"你想现在上车，还是稍等一会儿？"

"It won't leave without me, will it?"  
"它不会丢下我先走吧？"

"No."

"Then I'll wait." "那我就等等。"  
_  
No need to stand in that long line,  
没必要排那么长的队，_ Asuka thought. She glanced at Misato and noted that she appeared calm and serene—was that a trace of sadness in her eyes?  
明日香心想。她瞥了一眼美里，注意到她看起来平静而安详——她的眼中是否有一丝悲伤？

It seemed like no time had passed at all before Misato stood up and shook back her thinning sheet of purple hair. "Let's go, Asuka."  
仿佛没过多久，美里就站起身来，甩了甩她那日渐稀疏的紫色发丝。“我们走吧，明日香。”

Reluctantly the redhead followed. Behind her a young child pushed his brothers around and a small fight erupted—resulting in that one was thrown against the back of Asuka's legs, knocking her down.  
红发少女不情愿地跟随着。在她身后，一个小男孩推搡着他的兄弟们，一场小冲突爆发了——结果其中一人被甩到了明日香的小腿上，将她撞倒在地。

"Just hope they don't have a seat near you," Misato muttered out of the corner of her mouth, as the mother burst into apologies.  
“希望他们不要坐在你附近。”美里从嘴角低声嘀咕，与此同时那位母亲连声道歉。

All too soon it was time for Asuka to face the future alone.  
不久之后，明日香不得不独自面对未来。

Misato gave Asuka a hug and made her promise to email every night. "And call me as soon as you get there," she added.  
美里给了明日香一个拥抱，并让她答应每晚发邮件。“到了就马上给我打电话，”她补充道。

Asuka smiled bravely. "Bye."  
明日香勇敢地笑了笑。“再见。”

= = = = = = =

_Misato looked like she was about to say something to the flight attendant taking tickets,_ Asuka mused. _I wonder_ _what it was_.  
明日香暗自思忖，美里看起来像是要对检票的空姐说些什么。不知道她要说什么。

Thankfully, the noisy children (and their unfortunate mother) were situated in the back of the plane, but even there Asuka could hear their wails. She was seated by the window and kept her gaze focused outside. So far she had watched three airplanes take off from Narita International Airport.  
幸好，那些吵闹的孩子（以及他们不幸的母亲）被安排在飞机的后部，但即便如此，明日香还是能听到他们的哭声。她坐在窗边，目光始终凝视着窗外。到目前为止，她已经目睹了三架飞机从成田国际机场起飞。

The seat beside her was still empty. She wondered if anyone would come to occupy it.  
她旁边的座位依然空着。她不禁好奇是否有人会来坐在这里。

The answer appeared to be negative, for the people in the aisles eventually thinned out and the flight attendants came around to check that everyone had their seat belts on properly—yet no one took the seat beside her. A few more announcements followed in Japanese and English—Asuka repeated the English words quietly, trying to get used to the feel of the language.  
答案似乎是否定的，因为过道中的人群逐渐稀少，空乘人员开始检查每个人是否正确系好安全带——然而并没有人坐到她旁边的座位上。随后又有几次日语和英语的广播——明日香轻声重复着英语单词，试图适应这种语言的感觉。

And then the plane moved. Asuka glanced out the window and instinctively brought one hand to her locket.  
然后飞机动了。明日香瞥向窗外，本能地用手抚摸着她的项链。

_Here I come, Shinji. 我来了，真嗣。_

Author's notes: Or rather, apologies this time. I can't think of anything to describe this chapter other than a filler—the product of my writer's block. It's a bit late too—sorry!  
作者的话：或者更确切地说，这次是道歉。我想不出有什么能形容这一章，除了是填充章节——我写作障碍的产物。也有点晚了——抱歉！

If I'm not mistaken, LAX stands for Los Angeles International Airport.  
如果我没记错的话，LAX 代表洛杉矶国际机场。

Also, a few other notes I forgot to mention this time... both Madoka and Akamatsu-san's names are derived from Wakamatsu Madoka, also from Full Moon wo Sagashite. She's supposed to be an evil character, but I like her anyway.  
另外，还有几点我这次忘了提... 无论是圆香还是赤松同学的名字都源自《寻找满月》中的若松圆香。她本应是个反派角色，但我还是很喜欢她。

And lastly, I remember reading somewhere that ice cream makers are supposed to be good wedding presents. Not quite sure where, or if it's actually true...  
最后，我记得在某处读到过，冰淇淋机应该是不错的结婚礼物。不太确定具体出处，也不知道是否真的如此...

Anyways, drop me a review and tell me how I'm doing.  
总之，给我留个评论，告诉我做得如何。

### Chapter 15: In California  
第十五章：在加利福尼亚  

Shinji caught his breath as the redhead appeared, standing out distinctly in the throng of dark-haired Japanese. She was dressed in a red windbreaker and white shorts, glancing around distractedly with a bag in one hand. A moment later she noticed him and broke into a wide smile as she ran towards him.  
当红发女孩出现时，真嗣屏住了呼吸，她在众多黑发日本人中显得格外突出。她身穿红色风衣和白色短裤，一手提着包，心不在焉地环顾四周。片刻后，她注意到了他，随即绽放出灿烂的笑容，向他跑来。

"Shinji!" she called out, then restrained from throwing herself into his arms. Shinji took the bag from her hand, flung it carelessly into a nearby seat, and pulled her into his embrace.  
"真嗣！" 她喊道，随即克制住自己扑进他怀里的冲动。真嗣从她手中接过包，随意地扔到旁边一个座位上，然后将她拥入怀中。

"I've missed you," he whispered, in English. Asuka repeated the words after him.  
"我想你了，" 他用英语低声说道。明日香跟着重复了这句话。

They left the terminal and made their way out through the gift shops, where Shinji bought Asuka a little airplane shaped key-chain for her bag. He walked quickly, carrying her bag, and she had to hurry to keep up with him. Judging by his clothes, Asuka reasoned that he had just left from work. Shinji was wearing a black suit and his shoes clicked softly with every step on the tile floor. She trailed behind him as he picked up her suitcase, striding confidently out of the airport and into the heat of the Californian summer.  
他们离开航站楼，穿过礼品店，真嗣给明日香买了一个小飞机形状的钥匙扣挂在她包上。他走得很快，拎着她的包，她不得不加快脚步跟上他。从他的着装来看，明日香推测他刚下班。真嗣穿着一身黑色西装，皮鞋在瓷砖地板上轻轻作响。她跟在他后面，看着他拿起她的行李箱，自信地走出机场，步入加州夏日的热浪中。

Shinji stopped suddenly in the parking lot, causing Asuka to slam into him from the back. From one pocket he pulled out his chain of keys and held up one piece with a small series of buttons, his thumb positioned over the first. "Press this one."  
真嗣在停车场突然停下，让从后面撞上来的明日香措手不及。他从口袋里掏出一串钥匙，举起其中一块带有几个按钮的小部件，拇指按在第一个按钮上。“按这个。”

Asuka complied. A nearby car's lights flashed on and then off, emitting a beep.  
明日香照做了。附近一辆车的车灯闪烁了一下，随即熄灭，发出一声哔响。

"Is that your car?" she asked in wonder.  
“那是你的车吗？”她好奇地问道。

Shinji laughed. "Isn't it so much better than Misato's?"  
真嗣笑了。“不是比美里小姐的好多了吗？”

Asuka thought of Misato's old car, with fading paint and worn out wheels, and laughed with him as he tossed her bag and suitcase into the trunk. She climbed into the luxurious passenger seat as Shinji started the engine and turned on the air conditioner.  
明日香想起美里那辆油漆褪色、轮胎磨损的旧车，和他一起笑了起来，看着他把她的包和行李箱扔进后备箱。她爬进豪华的副驾驶座，真嗣启动引擎，打开了空调。

"I notice you're wearing the locket," Shinji added.  
“我注意到你戴着那个项链，”真嗣补充道。

Asuka reached for it affectionately and held it tightly within her hand. "Yes," she admitted, then shyly, "I've never taken it off."  
明日香温柔地伸手去拿，紧紧握在手中。“是的，”她承认道，然后羞涩地说，“我从未摘下过它。”

The corners of Shinji's mouth turned up slightly.  
真嗣的嘴角微微上扬。

At the next red light he reached into his other pocket and pulled out a cell phone, handing it to Asuka. "You'd better call Misato and tell her you've arrived, or she'll start to worry."  
在下一个红灯处，他伸手到另一个口袋里，掏出一部手机递给明日香。“你最好给美里打电话，告诉她你已经到了，不然她会担心的。”

Asuka was surprised to see that Misato was already in his address book.  
明日香惊讶地发现，美里已经在他通讯录里了。

When she returned the phone to him, Shinji was full of plans. "I have most of the week off, but Kensuke's been talking about wanting to meet you," he told her. "One of my coworkers is holding a dinner party at his house on Thursday, so I expect it'll be then. I figured that tomorrow we could go to SeaWorld, if you're up for a long drive—it'll be about three hours—and Tuesday I'll have to work, but Wednesday—"  
当她把手机还给他时，真嗣满脑子都是计划。“我这周大部分时间都休息，但健介一直在说要见你，”他告诉她。“我一个同事周四在他家办晚宴，所以我预计会是那时候。我想如果明天你愿意长途驾驶的话——大概要三个小时——我们可以去海洋世界，然后周二我得上班，但周三——”

"Shinji," Asuka murmured, putting her hand over his timidly, as if he might shy away from her touch, "It's all right. We have time."  
“真嗣，”明日香轻声说，怯生生地把手放在他手上，仿佛他可能会避开她的触碰，“没关系。我们有的是时间。”

"But you're leaving in a week," he said quietly. "I want to make the most of it."  
"但再过一周你就要走了，"他轻声说道，"我想好好珍惜这段时间。"

"I do too," Asuka added.  
"我也是，"明日香补充道。"

The orange Californian sunlight cast a soft glow on their faces. Asuka turned to look at Shinji. His eyes were focused on the road ahead, his wrists occasionally giving a sharp little movement to steer the wheel.  
加州的橙色阳光在他们脸上投下柔和的光辉。明日香转头看向真嗣。他的目光紧盯着前方的道路，手腕不时地做出一个利落的小动作来操控方向盘。

Shinji caught her staring and gave her a little smile. Slightly embarrassed, Asuka turned to her window.  
真嗣注意到她在盯着他看，便微微一笑。阿斯卡有些尴尬地转向车窗。

"There are so many trees," she remarked, shading her eyes against the sun. "It reminds me of Misato's house."  
“这里有好多树，”她遮住眼睛挡住阳光说道，“让我想起了美里小姐的房子。”

"I thought that too, when I came back from Japan. Except there are so many more here. And a lot less cars," he added.  
“我刚从日本回来时也是这么想的。只是这里的树更多。而且车少得多，”他补充道。

Asuka nodded. "Whenever I head off to work, the city is always full of cars and blaring horns."  
明日香点点头。“每当我去上班时，城市总是车水马龙，喇叭声此起彼伏。”

"You work now?" “你现在工作了？”

"Yes... do you remember the ice cream shop Misato took us to?"  
“是的……你还记得 Misato 带我们去的那家冰淇淋店吗？”

"Yes!" Shinji exclaimed. "That place had the best ice cream in all of Japan... if only I had some that now...damn this heat..."  
“太好了！”真嗣兴奋地说，“那家店的冰淇淋是全日本最好吃的……要是现在能吃上一口就好了……这该死的热天……”

His words drew another laugh from the redhead. Shinji had never heard anything so pleasant in his life. He reached over and toyed with a lock of her hair, promising himself that he would draw her into his arms the first chance he got.  
他的话又引得红发女孩一阵笑声。真嗣这辈子从未听过如此悦耳的声音。他伸出手，轻轻拨弄着她的一缕发丝，暗自发誓一有机会就要将她拥入怀中。

= = = = = = =

She hated touching the green button marked with a large black triangle, one acute angle pointing upward. Having been a doctor for so many years, she did not like to touch dirty things, and an elevator button did not count as "clean" in her book. Ritsuko bent her finger and pressed it with her knuckle.  
她讨厌触碰那个标有黑色大三角形的绿色按钮，一个锐角朝上。作为一名行医多年的医生，她不喜欢接触脏东西，而在她看来，电梯按钮可算不上“干净”。律子弯曲手指，用指节按下了按钮。

Nothing happened. The glass ring around the button did not glow orange, as it usually did.  
什么也没发生。按钮周围的玻璃环没有像往常那样发出橙光。

She pressed it again, to no avail.  
她又按了一次，但毫无效果。

Ritsuko's brow furrowed. 律子的眉头紧皱。

_Just my luck. 真是倒霉。_

She took the stairs instead, lifting her legs slowly, one step at a time as her knees cracked.  
她选择了楼梯，慢慢地抬起腿，一步一步地走，膝盖发出咔咔声。  
_  
Damn, I feel old.  
该死，我感觉自己老了。_

It was relief that she finally reached her flight of stairs and pushed open the door—to see the elevator door opening and two small children emerging.  
她终于抵达了自己的楼梯口，推开门的那一刻，却看到电梯门正缓缓打开，两个小孩从中走出，这让她松了一口气。

Ritsuko swore. 律子咒骂了一声。

Several minutes later she shoved her key into the keyhole and twisted it before pushing open the door. From the kitchen came sounds of sizzling oil. Suddenly wishing she had a gun, Ritsuko hesitated and flattened herself against the wall.  
几分钟后，她将钥匙插入锁孔，扭动后推开了门。厨房里传来油锅的滋滋声。突然间，律子希望自己手中有把枪，她犹豫了一下，紧贴着墙壁。  
_  
Surely if someone was here to rob me—or kill me—they wouldn't bother to take time  
如果有人来这里抢劫我——或者杀我——他们应该不会费心花时间_ cooking, w_ould they?_  做饭，对吧？

_Clang. 哐啷。_  
_  
That was most certainly someone dropping my pot.  
那肯定是有人打翻了我的锅。_

Moved by her curiosity, Ritsuko shifted away from the wall and tiptoed towards the kitchen.  
被好奇心驱使，律子离开墙壁，踮着脚尖朝厨房走去。

"MISATO!?" “美里！？”

"Hey, Ritsuko." The purple-haired woman turned around slightly, one hand still busy stirring the sizzling contents of the pot. "Had a good day?"  
“嘿，律子。”紫发女子微微转身，一只手仍在搅拌着锅中滋滋作响的食物。“今天过得好吗？”

The blonde shook her head as if to clear her mind. "What are you doing here? No wait, first—how'd you get in here?"  
金发女子摇了摇头，仿佛要理清思绪。“你在这里做什么？等等，首先——你是怎么进来的？”

Misato smiled slyly, reached into her pocket, and pulled out a set of keys.  
美里狡黠一笑，伸手从口袋里掏出一串钥匙。

"You left these at my house last time," she reminded. "I wanted to see how long it would take for you to notice... except apparently you never did."  
"上次你把这些落在我家了，"她提醒道，"我想看看你多久会发现... 结果显然你一直没注意到。"

The blonde turned promptly red. _Damn, I_ am _getting old._  
金发女子立刻脸红了。该死，我真是老了。

Misato waved a spoon heartily. "Ready for dinner?"  
美里热情地挥舞着勺子。"准备好吃饭了吗？"

The blonde blanched instead. Misato gave the pot a final stir, then spooned out the contents into two bowls and handed one to Ritsuko, who drank in the warm scent hungrily without bothering to find out what it was.  
金发女子脸色一白。美里最后搅拌了一下锅里的食物，然后舀出两碗，递给律子一碗，后者饥渴地吸着那温暖的香气，顾不上探究那是什么。

"Where's Asuka?" she asked, following the former Commander into her own breakfast room.  
“明日香呢？”她跟着前指挥官走进自己的早餐室问道。

"She's off visiting Shinji in America."  
“她去美国看望真嗣了。”

"What? You let her fly to America alone?"  
"什么？你让她一个人飞去美国了？"

Misato smiled as she sat up. "Eat up, Ritsuko, while I fill you in on the details—you need it. And when you're done, I've brought a gallon of the most delectable ice cream in Japan."  
美里笑着坐起身来。“快吃吧，律子，我一边告诉你详情——你肯定想知道。吃完后，我还带了一加仑日本最美味的冰淇淋。”

= = = = = = =

"This is your house?!" "这是你的房子？！"

Shinji was amused at her reaction. They had driven over a drawbridge, passed the huge letters reading "HOLLYWOOD" on the famous mountain, and she was most impressed by his house?  
真嗣被她的反应逗乐了。他们驶过一座吊桥，经过那座著名的山上写着“HOLLYWOOD”的巨大字母，而她最印象深刻的竟是他的房子？

Asuka marveled at the splendor of it. Shinji's house was set in a tiny corner of Los Angeles filled with trees and meadows, so rural that she expected to hear cows mooing. Instead there was only the tranquility of pure nature and a bird flittering overhead.  
明日香惊叹于这壮丽景象。真嗣的房子坐落在洛杉矶一个遍布树木和草地的小角落，如此乡村，她甚至期待听到牛的哞声。然而，这里只有纯粹自然的宁静和头顶上掠过的鸟儿。

His house resembled a large cottage nestled away in a jungle of trees and ivy, built with white walls and natural brown roofs. The windows were cozy and inviting. A little path paved with stone guided the way to the door, and Shinji took Asuka's hand as he led her into the house.  
他的房子宛如一座隐藏在树丛和常春藤中的大型小屋，以白色墙壁和天然棕色屋顶建成。窗户温馨而诱人。一条铺着石子的小径引领着通往门口，真嗣牵起明日香的手，带她走进屋内。

Her first reaction was that they must still be outside—it couldn't be so bright inside. Upon closer inspection, however, Asuka noticed that there were indeed no fancy lamps on; two-story high windows adorned several walls, allowing the sunlight to stream in. Everything was green, ranging from the jungle green sofa to the jade counters in his kitchen. As if there wasn't enough foliage around his house, Shinji had also placed pots of hanging plants and small trees at strategic locations around the house.  
她的第一反应是他们肯定还在外面——室内不可能这么明亮。然而，仔细一看，Asuka 注意到确实没有华丽的灯具；几面墙上装饰着两层楼高的窗户，阳光倾泻而入。一切都绿意盎然，从丛林绿的沙发到他厨房里的翡翠色柜台。仿佛他家周围的绿植还不够多，Shinji 还在屋内战略性地摆放了吊兰和小树盆栽。

He placed his hands on her shoulders. "Like it?"  
他把手放在她的肩膀上。"喜欢吗？"

"It's gorgeous," she whispered.  
“美极了，”她低声说道。

Asuka was embarrassed to notice he was carrying both her bag and her suitcase. "I'll get these up in your room for now," he insisted, when she tried to take over. "Feel free to wander."  
明日香注意到他正拿着她的包和行李箱，感到有些尴尬。“我现在就把这些拿到你房间去，”他坚持道，当她试图接手时。“随便逛逛吧。”

Helpless to stop him, Asuka obeyed.  
明日香无助地看着他，只好顺从。

The green furniture provided a nice contrast against the pure white walls, Asuka thought, as she took off her white sandals and placed them neatly against the glass door. She took one tentative step onto the carpet and almost giggled. This was nothing like the worn floor coverings of Misato's house; the carpet was thick and fluffy and gave Asuka the impression of walking on clouds. She tiptoed over to the main living room, then stared up in amazement at the sight that had awaited her.  
明日香觉得绿色的家具与纯白的墙壁形成了很好的对比，她脱下白色的凉鞋，整齐地放在玻璃门旁。她小心翼翼地踏上地毯，差点笑出声来。这与美里家的破旧地板覆盖物完全不同；地毯厚实而蓬松，让明日香感觉像是在云端行走。她踮着脚尖走到客厅，然后抬头惊讶地看着眼前的景象。

Over the fireplace—and a very large one it was, too—was an enormous oil portrait featuring younger versions of herself, Shinji, and a girl she recognized as Ayanami Rei, apparently on their way from or to school. The girls were carrying black leather suitcases and Shinji was wearing a two- strap backpack over both shoulders. The difference, however, was in how they walked.  
壁炉上方——而且是一个相当大的壁炉——挂着一幅巨大的油画，画中是她、真嗣和一个她认出是绫波零的女孩，显然是在上学途中或放学回家的场景。女孩们提着黑色皮革手提箱，而真嗣则背着双肩带的书包。不过，他们的行走方式却有所不同。

She was skipping, leaning forward slightly with a confident smile, holding the suitcase behind her back with both hands.  
她正跳跃着前行，微微前倾，自信地微笑着，双手背在身后提着箱子。

Shinji was walking evenly, both arms hanging in relaxation at his sides, his mouth open in mid-sentence.  
真嗣则步伐平稳，双臂自然垂在身侧，嘴巴微张，似乎正在说话。

Rei was taking small steps, her stance held back slightly and accentuated by an expressionless face, the suitcase handle held securely in her right hand.  
丽正小心翼翼地迈着小步，她的姿态略显拘谨，面无表情，右手紧紧握着行李箱的把手。

Three distinctive ways to walk, describing the unique personalities of three utterly different people.  
三种独特的走路方式，描绘了三个截然不同的人的独特个性。  
_  
I wonder where Shinji got this,  
我想知道真嗣是从哪儿弄到这个的，_ she thought, as she continued to stare up at it, marveling at the massive size of the work. Asuka sensed the presence of another human being and turned around to see Shinji leaning casually against the wall, watching her.  
她心想，继续仰望着它，惊叹于这件作品的巨大尺寸。明日香感觉到另一个人的存在，转过身来，看到真嗣正随意地靠在墙上，注视着她。

"Where did you get this?" she asked.  
“这幅画你是从哪儿弄来的？”她问道。

"Misato took the photograph," he explained quietly, "and a few years ago I had a painter transform it into an oil painting." Shinji stepped closer until he was right in front of the fireplace, craning his head to look up. "I've always thought he ruined your eyes—they're so much grayer than they really are."  
“美里拿走了那张照片，”他轻声解释道，“几年前我请一位画家把它转绘成了一幅油画。”真嗣走近了一些，直到站在壁炉前，仰头向上看。“我一直觉得他毁了你的眼睛——它们比实际的要灰得多。”

Shinji looked her directly in the eye as he spoke. Asuka looked away, and Shinji immediately withdrew, feeling shy again.  
真嗣直视着她的眼睛说话。明日香移开了目光，真嗣立刻退缩，再次感到害羞。

"What would you like for dinner?" he asked instead, changing the subject.  
“晚餐你想吃什么？”他改口问道，转换了话题。

Asuka had not noticed that she was hungry, but the overhead clock informed her that it was nearly eight.  
明日香并未察觉自己饿了，但头顶的时钟告诉她，时间已近八点。

"I don't mind, anything's fine."  
"我无所谓，什么都行。"

"I don't really feel like cooking tonight," Shinji admitted honestly. "Do you mind take out?"  
"今晚我真不想做饭，" 真嗣老实承认道，"你介意叫外卖吗？"

Fifteen minutes later, Asuka had perused a variety of menus and made her selections. Shinji was on the phone, making their orders. A moment later he replaced the phone in its cradle and reached into a cupboard, pulling out two candleholders and two matching red candles. "I know it's not very romantic, but would you like to eat dinner outside?"  
十五分钟后，明日香翻阅了好几份菜单，选好了菜品。真嗣正在打电话下单。片刻后，他挂断电话，从橱柜里拿出两个烛台和两根相配的红色蜡烛。"我知道这不太浪漫，但你愿意在外面吃晚餐吗？"

If Asuka had thought the house was huge... no, there simply weren't any words she could think of to describe the deck. It seemed larger than the first floor of Misato's house and consisted of several floors, with various miniature staircases connecting them. Shinji led her up to the main area, which was adorned with a glass table and wire chairs laden with fluffy pillows. While Asuka seated herself, Shinji set up the umbrella for fun. He then proceeded to hand her a tiny bottle.  
如果明日香觉得房子已经很大了...不，她实在找不到任何词汇来形容这个露台。它似乎比美里家的第一层还要大，由几层组成，各层之间通过迷你楼梯相连。真嗣领着她来到主区域，那里摆着一张玻璃桌和几把装满蓬松靠垫的金属椅子。明日香坐下后，真嗣为了好玩撑起了遮阳伞。随后，他递给她一个小瓶子。

"Mosquito Repellent?" she asked, trying out the words on the label tentatively.  
“驱蚊剂？”她试探性地念出标签上的字。

"You'll need it, believe me," Shinji replied grimly. "They'll be coming in clouds soon—I hope the candles will keep them away, to some extent. Just spray it over your arms and legs." The doorbell rang and Shinji ran to answer it, while Asuka followed his directions and found herself swathed in a misty scent that seemed both minty and bitter.  
“你肯定需要这个，相信我，”真嗣严肃地回答，“很快就会有成群的蚊子飞来——我希望蜡烛能起到一些驱赶作用。只要喷在手臂和腿上就行了。”门铃响起，真嗣跑去应门，而明日香按照指示操作，发现自己被一股既像薄荷又带苦味的雾气包围。

Shinji lit the candles and filled her plate for her before sitting down across from her. Without further interruption, the two dug in.  
真嗣点燃了蜡烛，为她盛满盘子，然后坐在她对面。两人没有多言，开始享用晚餐。

= = = = = = =

"You were right about the mosquitoes."  
“你说得对，蚊子真多。”

"I know." Shinji slapped at a pesky insect that had landed on his arm. "I learned from years of experience..."  
“我知道。”真嗣拍打着停在他手臂上的烦人昆虫，“这都是多年经验教给我的……”

Asuka laughed for what seemed like the thousandth time that night. They were resting on a lower level of the grand deck now, in soft reclining chairs that allowed them both to lie down as they stared up at the stars. Shinji knew the name of a few and taught them to the redhead, and they enjoyed making up names for the ones they didn't know.  
那一晚，明日香似乎已经是第一百次大笑了。他们现在正躺在宏伟甲板的下层，柔软的躺椅让他们可以舒适地仰望星空。真嗣认识其中几颗星星的名字，并教给了红发的明日香，他们还乐此不疲地为那些不知名的星星编造名字。

"How long have you been here, Shinji?" she asked quietly.  
“你在这里多久了，真嗣？”她轻声问道。

Shinji tensed, and for a moment she feared she had asked the wrong question.  
真嗣紧张起来，有那么一刻，她担心自己问错了问题。

"I left Misato's house about the same time you did, and stayed with Kensuke's family for a while. When they moved to Osaka, I went with them...I wanted to say goodbye to Touji's sister and tell his parents I was sorry, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I didn't think they'd ever want to see me again," he whispered, "after what I'd done to their son."  
"我离开美里小姐家的时间和你差不多，之后在真希介家待了一阵子。他们搬去大阪时，我也跟着去了……我想向冬二的妹妹告别，并告诉他的父母我很抱歉，但我实在做不到。我以为他们再也不想见到我了，"他低声说，"毕竟我对他们的儿子做了那样的事。"

Asuka turned to look at him, but his eyes were focused on the stars as he spoke again.  
明日香转头看向他，但他目光凝视着星空，继续说道。

"Kensuke never lost his love of photography. After the angel attacks stopped, the military defenses we had mounted up slowly lost importance. He concentrated on nature instead, and for awhile on people," Shinji explained, one corner of his mouth rising in a crooked smile. "Unfortunately, following them around and snapping countless pictures was not a good way to get girls to like him.  
"真希介对摄影的热爱从未消减。天使袭击停止后，我们建立的军事防御逐渐失去了重要性。他转而专注于自然，有一段时间也拍人，"真嗣解释道，嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝苦笑。"可惜，跟踪他们并拍下无数照片并不是赢得女孩好感的良策。

"We went to college here, together...Kensuke of course studied photography, and I meandered from subject to subject, changing my major constantly. I was never like Kensuke, who knew exactly what he wanted to do, and so when he graduated and went to work for a magazine I went with him.  
“我们曾一起在这里上大学...健介当然学的是摄影，而我则漫无目的地在各个学科间徘徊，专业换了一个又一个。我从未像健介那样明确知道自己想要什么，所以当他毕业去杂志社工作时，我也跟着他去了。”

"How about you? Are you planning to stay with Misato?"  
“你呢？你打算一直和美里在一起吗？”

The question struck Asuka lightly this time. She remembered that several months ago, she had received quite a heavy shock when one of the children had asked her how long she would be staying.  
这个问题这次对明日香触动不大。她记得几个月前，当其中一个孩子问她会待多久时，她曾受到相当大的冲击。

"As long as she wants me, I guess," Asuka finished finally. "I don't really have anywhere else to go, and she doesn't seem to mind too much. Besides, now that I have a job, I'm not depending solely on her and causing her stress."  
“只要她还想要我，我想，”明日香终于说道，“我其实无处可去，而她似乎也不太介意。再说，现在我有工作了，不再完全依赖她，给她添压力。”

"You could always come live here," Shinji offered seriously.  
“你随时可以来这里住，”真嗣认真地提议道。

Silence. Shinji turned to look at her and saw that her eyes were big and blue, the stars reflecting in their sapphire depths.  
沉默。真嗣转头看向她，发现她的眼睛又大又蓝，星星的光芒在蓝宝石般的深邃中闪烁。

"Thank you," she replied at last, in a voice saturated with sincerity. "I had a wonderful time today, Shinji."  
"谢谢你，" 她终于回答道，声音里充满了真诚。"我今天过得很愉快，真嗣。"

His hand found hers, and he was relieved to feel that her palm was dry and her fingers relaxed. "If you thought today was fun, just wait until tomorrow." Excitement crept into his voice. "We're going to go swimming with dolphins, watch killer whale shows, and—how does a water ride sound?"  
他的手找到了她的，他松了一口气，感觉到她的手掌干燥，手指放松。"如果你觉得今天很有趣，那就等着明天吧。" 他的声音里透出了兴奋。"我们要去和海豚一起游泳，看虎鲸表演，还有——水上过山车怎么样？"

"It sounds wonderful." "听起来很棒。"

Shinji smiled up to the heavens.  
真嗣向着天空微笑。

_Thank goodness I found you, Asuka.  
谢天谢地，我找到你了，明日香。_

= = = = = = =

"Wake up, Misato." “醒醒，美里。”

The two translucent Ritsukos in front of her rotated slowly in circles and finally melded into one very opaque blonde doctor. Misato attempted to lift her head, decided the amount of effort required was not worth it, and dropped it back to the table with a loud thud.  
她面前的两个半透明律子缓缓旋转，最终融合成一个非常不透明的金发医生。美里试图抬起头，但觉得所需的努力不值得，于是又重重地将头放回桌上。

"Come on..." “快点...”

The doctor was tugging lightly at her arm now. Misato sighed and propped up her chin with one hand. "Damn it, what do you want, Ritsuko? Do you know how tiring it is to drive to this place from Tokyo-3? And what time is it now, anyway? Three?"  
医生现在轻轻地拉着她的手臂。美里叹了口气，用一只手撑着下巴。“该死，你想要什么，律子？你知道从第三新东京市开车到这里有多累吗？再说现在几点了？三点吗？”

Ritsuko ignored her and spooned out a large serving of ice cream, waving it tantalizingly in front of the former Major's mouth. "Don't you want some?"  
律子无视了她，舀了一大勺冰淇淋，在原少校的嘴前挑逗地晃动。“你不想来点吗？”

Reluctantly Misato opened her mouth to grant the spoon entrance.  
米萨托不情愿地张开嘴，让勺子进入。

"All right, you win," she muttered, sitting up. "Give me some."  
“好吧，你赢了，”她嘟囔着坐起身，“给我来点。”

Author's Notes: Next time will have Asuka and Shinji in SeaWorld... I have to add that I invented some details about Los Angeles, so my apologies about any errors.  
作者的话：下次会有明日香和真嗣在海洋世界...我必须补充说，我虚构了一些关于洛杉矶的细节，所以对于任何错误我深表歉意。

I'm also trying to work Rei into this story, except Shinji and Asuka are having such a good time that I don't want to ruin it for them...she will definitely be here in the end though—that chapter is already half-written.  
我也试图在这故事中加入绫波，只是真嗣和明日香玩得正开心，我不想破坏他们的兴致...但她最终肯定会出现在这里的——那一章已经写了一半。

Drop me a review and tell me how I'm doing. Thanks so much to all of you!  
请留下评论告诉我做得如何。非常感谢大家！

### Chapter 16: Monday
He had been worried about boring her during the long ride. Shinji was not a fast driver like Misato; he enjoyed going along at his own leisurely pace, and unlike a trip through Tokyo-3, a trip through California could get boring easily with the repetitive forests and occasional glimpse of ocean. Maybe she'd like to go to the beach sometime.  
他一直担心长途驾驶会让她感到无聊。真嗣不像美里那样开车快；他喜欢按照自己的悠闲节奏行驶，而且与穿越第三东京市的旅程不同，穿越加利福尼亚的旅程很容易因为重复的森林和偶尔瞥见的海景而变得乏味。也许她会喜欢改天去海滩玩。

Shinji glanced at the clock and noted that they had been driving for nearly two hours. Asuka sat in the passenger's seat, to his right, and had her forehead pressed against the window.  
真嗣瞥了一眼时钟，注意到他们已经开了近两个小时的车。明日香坐在副驾驶座上，在他右边，额头紧贴着车窗。

"Are you hot?" “你热吗？”

She turned abruptly and smiled. "No, I'm fine."  
她突然转过头，微笑道：“不，我很好。”

Pause. 暂停。

They stopped for lunch in a local restaurant while passing through a small town. Shinji ordered a burger without even looking at the menu; Asuka wavered between a salad and spaghetti and finally settled on the noodles. When the waiter brought their orders, however, she found the sauce foreign and scraped most of it off before bringing it to her mouth. On their way back to the car Shinji stopped at a roadside stand and purchased a sack of oranges.  
他们在穿过一个小镇时，在一家当地餐馆停下来吃午饭。真嗣没看菜单就点了一个汉堡；明日香在沙拉和意大利面之间犹豫不决，最后选择了面条。然而，当服务员端上他们的订单时，她觉得酱料很陌生，于是刮掉了大部分才送到嘴边。回车上的路上，真嗣在路边摊停下，买了一袋橙子。

Asuka stopped with her thumb midway through the peel. A gentle spray of citric acid sprayed out and coated her knuckles.  
明日香剥橙子时停了下来。一股柔和的柠檬酸喷雾喷出，覆盖了她的指关节。

"Something wrong?" Shinji glanced at her in the rearview mirror. Asuka noticed the concern in his honest brown eyes and quickly smiled.  
“有什么不对吗？”真嗣从后视镜里瞥了她一眼。明日香注意到他真诚的棕色眼睛里的关切，迅速笑了笑。

"No, nothing." “不，没什么。”

Shinji smiled. 真嗣笑了。

Asuka was thinking of her first days after waking from the long coma. Her nurse had brought her oranges, and she recalled the first joys of peeling off the thick, rubbery outside. She dug her thumb deep under the peel and pulled upward. The fruit emitted a soft tearing sound as she ripped away the peel.  
明日香回想起从漫长的昏迷中醒来后的最初几天。她的护士给她带来了橙子，她记得第一次剥开厚实、有弹性的外皮时的喜悦。她用拇指深深地插入果皮下，向上拉扯。随着她撕开果皮，果实发出了一阵轻微的撕裂声。

_How far I've come since then.  
自那时起，我已走了多远。_

They were driving into yet another wooded road, and the leaves of the overhead canopy shredded the sunlight so that only fine slivers showered down on the hot metal of Shinji's car. He drummed his fingers anxiously on the steering wheel and swallowed a yawn.  
他们正驶入另一条林间小路，头顶的树冠将阳光撕碎，只有细碎的光线洒落在真嗣的车上滚烫的金属表面。他焦虑地用手指敲打着方向盘，咽下了一个哈欠。

Asuka had awakened before him that morning, and was already wandering around the house fully dressed when he had wandered into the kitchen, only half-awake. Slightly embarrassed, he had hurried to make pancakes and pack a bag with anything they might need during the day. By nine, they were out the door and heading down the street.  
那天早上，明日香比他先醒，当他半梦半醒地走进厨房时，她已经穿着整齐地在屋里转悠了。他有些尴尬，急忙去煎 pancakes 并打包了一袋可能需要的东西。到了九点，他们已经出门，沿着街道前行。

"Is that it?" Asuka asked, her voice breaking into his reflections. He followed the direction of her finger—sure enough, partially obscured by the curve in the road, was a large billboard reading: SeaWorld, 15 miles. "Fifteen miles. That's not very far, is it?" she asked carefully, in clipped English.  
"就这个吗？" 明日香问道，她的声音打断了他的沉思。他顺着她手指的方向看去——果然，在道路的弯曲处，隐约可见一块巨大的广告牌，上面写着：SeaWorld，15 英里。"十五英里。那不是很远，对吧？" 她小心翼翼地用生硬的英语问道。

He chuckled at her cautious tone. "No, it's not far." She beamed, and he went on to compliment, "I'm impressed with your English."  
他轻笑于她的谨慎语气。"不，不远。" 她露出了笑容，他继续称赞道，"我对你的英语印象深刻。"

The redhead grinned a little, then switched back to Japanese. "I was surprised, too, by just how much I remembered...when I first got off the plane and realized I could understand most of what people around me were saying." She glanced out the window, donning a serious expression. "I don't know where I learned it, though... I practiced a little with Misato before I left Japan, and she guessed that I studied it in college in Germany."  
红发女孩微微一笑，然后切换回日语。"我自己也很惊讶，竟然记得这么多...当我第一次下飞机，意识到我能理解周围人大部分的话时。" 她望向窗外，表情变得严肃。"不过，我不知道我是从哪里学来的...我在离开日本前和美里练习了一点，她猜我是在德国上大学时学的。"  
_  
That's right, she went to college in Germany before coming to Japan. And she tutored me in thermal expansion.  
没错，她先是在德国上的大学，后来才来到日本。她还辅导过我热膨胀的课程。_

"Did I ever talk to you in English... back... then?"  
“我那时候……有跟你用英语交谈过吗？”

"I don't think so," Shinji tried to recall. "You were a genius, but you sometimes had a hard time with tests at school because you couldn't read the kanji."  
“我不记得了，”真嗣努力回忆道，“你是个天才，但有时候在学校考试会遇到困难，因为你读不懂汉字。”

There was a short pause in which Asuka smiled to herself, trying to dig up these childhood memories that she had shared with Shinji. They were buried somewhere deep within the crevices of her fourteen-year-old mind, hidden from the twenty-six year old young woman.  
有那么短暂的停顿，Asuka 暗自微笑，试图挖掘那些与 Shinji 共享的童年记忆。它们深埋在她十四岁心灵的裂缝中，对那位二十六岁的年轻女性隐藏着。

"There's another sign," Asuka pointed out, getting excited now. The billboard proclaimed "SeaWorld" in large bold letters, half black and blue, against a background of waves and dolphins. "Oh, I can't wait."  
“又有一个标志，”Asuka 指出，现在变得兴奋起来。广告牌上用大胆的黑蓝字母写着“SeaWorld”，背景是波浪和海豚。“哦，我等不及了。”

"I can't either," Shinji added, and it was the truth; he had not been to SeaWorld in several years, since he and Kensuke had promptly been asked to leave after the avid photographer sneaked into the back of the penguin exhibit, attempting to get a close-up picture. The result was a loud commotion involving many wet feathers and one very disgruntled guard. Needless to mention, no useful photos were produced.  
“我也等不及了，”Shinji 补充道，这是真的；他已经有好几年没去过 SeaWorld 了，自从他和 Kensuke 被要求离开后，那位热衷摄影的朋友偷偷溜进企鹅展览的后面，试图拍一张近距离的照片。结果引发了一场涉及许多湿羽毛和一位非常不满的保安的喧嚣。不用说，没有拍出有用的照片。

Twenty minutes later Shinji pulled into a parking space after weaving in and out of the tour buses. Asuka all but ran out of the car, eager to stretch her legs, and Shinji had to chase after her. She laughed as he did so, her long hair streaming in the soft breeze. God, he would never get tired of hearing her laugh. He paid for the tickets and took her hand as they raced toward the Dolphin Discovery—Shinji had no intention of being left behind again. Unfortunately, much to their dismay, it was closed and the next show was not for several hours—so they headed towards the flamingo exhibit instead.  
二十分钟后，真嗣在旅游巴士间穿梭，终于找到了一个停车位。明日香几乎是跑出了车外，急切地想要伸展双腿，真嗣不得不追在她后面。她边跑边笑，长发在微风中飘扬。天啊，他永远也听不腻她的笑声。他付了门票钱，牵起她的手，两人一起向海豚发现馆奔去——真嗣可不想再被落下。不幸的是，令他们失望的是，那里已经关门了，下一场表演还要等几个小时——于是他们转而前往火烈鸟展区。

They took their time, stopping to take a look every now and then in a gift shop. There were a variety of trees and flowers scattered throughout the park, and Asuka wanted to stop to admire all of them. Shinji fumbled through his pack for a camera and snapped a picture of the redhead kneeling beside a cluster of wild lilies.  
他们悠闲地走着，时不时停下来在礼品店里看看。公园里散布着各种各样的树木和花卉，明日香想要停下来欣赏每一处。真嗣在背包里摸索着找相机，给跪在一丛野百合旁的明日香拍了张照片。

Asuka noticed a foul stench and asked, "What is that smell?"  
明日香闻到一股难闻的气味，问道：“这是什么味道？”

Shinji didn't like it any better than she did, but he was afraid that the truth would make her want to turn back. He replied, "You'll see in a minute," and immediately regretted it, but the redhead only smiled and squeezed his hand. They passed a large clump of ferns—then—  
真嗣对此并不比她更喜欢，但他担心真相会让她想转身回去。他回答说：“你马上就会看到了。”随即就后悔了，但红发女孩只是微笑着握紧了他的手。他们经过一大丛蕨类植物——然后——

"Oh my gosh!" “哦，我的天哪！”

One fat pink flamingo looked up at her star-struck face, fluffed out its feathers, then went back to hunting for food in the shallow water.  
一只胖胖的粉红色火烈鸟抬头看着她那张着迷的脸，抖了抖羽毛，然后又回到浅水中寻找食物。

All Shinji wanted to do was hold his nose and back away as far as he could. Asuka, on the other hand, went closer—and leaned in towards the birds.  
小真嗣只想捂住鼻子，尽可能地往后退。而明日香则相反，她走得更近——并向着那些鸟儿俯身过去。

"How can their legs hold them up?" she marveled aloud. "They're so skinny! And their necks so long!"  
“它们的腿怎么能支撑得住呢？”她惊叹出声，“那么细！而且脖子还那么长！”

As if in reply, one particularly fat flamingo hoisted up one leg into his feathers and tucked his head under his wing. The girl watched in amazement as the bird remained perfectly balanced on his other skinny leg.  
仿佛在回答她，一只特别肥的火烈鸟抬起一条腿缩进羽毛里，把头埋在翅膀下。女孩惊讶地看着那只鸟用另一条细腿稳稳地保持着平衡。

"Asuka." Shinji's voice was strained and rather funny sounding, as he was pinching his nose.  
“明日香。” 真嗣的声音听起来很紧张，而且有些滑稽，因为他正捏着鼻子。

"Sorry." She hurried away from the murky swamp. Shinji gasped for air as they ran, making her laugh.  
“对不起。” 她急忙离开那片浑浊的沼泽。真嗣一边跑一边大口喘气，逗得她笑了起来。

Their next stop was to see the penguins, which were housed inside a large, partially lit facility, which was maintained at an extremely low temperature. Containing this cubicle was a darkened room with a series of steps facing the penguins, where viewers sat. However, so many eager children were pressing against the glass of the penguins' home that it was nearly impossible to see anything but dark human heads from the staircase, so Shinji and Asuka made their way up to the front.  
他们的下一站是去看企鹅，这些企鹅被安置在一个大型、部分照明的设施内，温度维持得极低。这个隔间外是一个昏暗的房间，有一系列面对企鹅的台阶，供观众坐下。然而，许多急切的孩子紧贴着企鹅住所的玻璃，从楼梯上几乎只能看到黑压压的人头，于是真嗣和明日香只好挤到前面去。

"It's Pen-pen!" Asuka whispered, "...except without the red tufted feathers on his head."  
“是 Pen-pen！”明日香低声说道，“……只是头上没有那撮红色的羽毛。”

Shinji was rather preoccupied with hoping that the guards wouldn't recognize him.  
真嗣相当担心守卫会认出他来。

_Pen-pen sleeps in Misato's freezer, but he still loves to come out and play in normal temperatures,_ Asuka thought. A group of penguins lined up neatly on an icy edge and, one by one, hopped into the water. _How dreadful it must be to live here, in this cold and dark place.  
Pen-pen 睡在美里小姐的冰箱里，但他仍然喜欢在常温下出来玩耍，明日香心想。一群企鹅整齐地排在一处冰冷的边缘，一个接一个地跳进水里。住在这寒冷黑暗的地方，一定很可怕。  
_  
Having lived with a penguin for a good amount of time, Asuka didn't find the penguins nearly as amusing as the fat flamingoes, and was soon ready to leave. When she stepped back, however, her foot landed on someone else's—and that someone else let out a soft wince.  
与企鹅共处了一段不短的时间后，明日香对这些企鹅的兴趣远不如那些肥硕的火烈鸟，很快就准备离开了。然而，当她后退一步时，脚却踩到了别人的脚——被踩的那个人轻轻地皱了皱眉。

"Oh, I'm sorry," Asuka quickly supplied. But the girl's face held no emotion, even as she raised it to meet Asuka's gaze.  
“哦，对不起。”明日香连忙道歉。但那女孩的脸上没有任何表情，即便她抬起头来与明日香对视。

She was a young girl, only about four or five, but it was her hair that caught and held Asuka's gaze for several moments. It was blue, an icy cold blue that chilled Asuka as it eerily reflected the faint glow of the penguins' habitat—  
她是个小女孩，大约只有四五岁，但吸引明日香目光的是她的头发。那是一种冰冷的蓝色，让明日香感到一阵寒意，它诡异地反射着企鹅栖息地微弱的荧光——

"Rei?" "丽？"

The girl's face was alight against the dark background; shadows danced on her face; unconsciously Asuka had already blocked out the senseless chatter of those around her—  
女孩的脸在暗色背景中显得格外明亮；阴影在她脸上跳跃；不知不觉中，明日香已经屏蔽了周围那些无意义的闲聊——

"I am not Rei," she said levelly, in a voice that was much too old for a child her age.  
"我不是丽，"她平静地说，声音对于她这个年龄的孩子来说显得过于成熟。

"I'm sorry," Asuka apologized. "I—I just thought..."  
"对不起，" 明日香道歉道。"我——我只是以为..."

The spell broke. The Rei-like child became a normal girl caught up in the excitement of summer vacation. She gazed up at Asuka with large, fearful eyes, then ran—_amazing,_ thought Asuka, _that eyes which were just a moment ago so devoid of all feeling could suddenly make all the difference in whether she was a memory or a real, live child._  
魔法解除了。那个像丽一样的孩子变成了一个沉浸在暑假兴奋中的普通女孩。她用大大的、充满恐惧的眼睛抬头看着明日香，然后跑开了——明日香惊讶地想，就在刚才还毫无感情的眼睛，现在却突然决定了她是记忆中的幻影还是真实存在的生命。

_That didn't make sense_. She shook herself, trying to rid herself of the cold feeling the child had given her.  
这说不通。她摇了摇头，试图摆脱那个孩子带给她的寒意。

"Shall we go?" she asked Shinji, rather anxious to get out of the dark confines of the penguin house.  
“我们走吧？”她问真嗣，急切地想离开企鹅馆的昏暗环境。

= = = = = = =

Several hours later Asuka was eating a three-colored Popsicle and had managed to stain her tongue ocean blue. Shinji was working on an ice cream sandwich and had to lick frantically to keep it from dripping as he checked his watch. "The Dolphin Discovery starts in fifteen minutes."  
几个小时后，明日香正在吃一根三色冰棍，舌头已经染成了海洋蓝。真嗣在吃冰淇淋三明治，不得不急忙舔舐以防滴落，同时查看手表。“海豚发现秀还有十五分钟开始。”

They made it just in time and selected seats in the eleventh row, where they would get a perfect view. Asuka had never seen a dolphin nor a killer whale before and Shinji had been kicked out before getting to attend the show last time, so naturally both were quite excited.  
他们及时赶到，选择了第十一排的座位，视野绝佳。明日香从未见过海豚或杀人鲸，而上次真嗣被赶出去前没能观看表演，所以两人自然都非常兴奋。

Until they got soaked. 直到他们被淋得湿透。

Asuka screamed and dived for cover behind Shinji, who unfortunately took the full drenching. A brief intermission took place, as guests grumbled and moaned about the 55-degree seawater. Shinji spit a mouthful of it onto the back of the seat in front of him.  
明日香尖叫着躲到真嗣身后，不幸的是，真嗣完全被海水浇透了。客人们抱怨着 55 度海水的寒冷，场面暂时中断。真嗣吐出一口海水，溅在前排座椅的靠背上。

"Sorry," Asuka apologized in a small voice. Shinji shrugged, evidently not mad.  
“对不起，”明日香小声道歉。真嗣耸了耸肩，显然并没有生气。

They watched several trainers feed and swim with the dolphins and killer whales. At one point they called for a volunteer, and Asuka raised her hand high—but they chose a little blonde boy who was not yet eight. A trainer guided him onto the whale's back and handed him fish to throw into the animal's mouth. Asuka was disappointed.  
他们观看了几位训练师喂食并与海豚和杀人鲸一起游泳。有一次他们招募志愿者，明日香高高地举起了手——但他们选择了一个还没满八岁的小金发男孩。一位训练师引导他骑到鲸鱼背上，并递给他鱼让他扔进动物嘴里。明日香感到失望。

"Well, at least you're dry," Shinji commented helpfully as they passed the boy on the way out. He was now howling about the salt water in his eyes, and nothing his mother did would shush him. The father stood off to the side, looking rather red and embarrassed.  
“好吧，至少你没湿。”他们离开时经过那个男孩，真嗣善意地评论道。男孩现在因为眼睛进了盐水而嚎啕大哭，无论他妈妈怎么哄都没用。父亲站在一旁，看起来相当尴尬，脸都红了。

"Time to stop for dinner?" Shinji suggested. Asuka agreed; she hadn't noticed how hungry she was until the whale started wolfing down pounds of fish.  
“该停下来吃晚饭了吧？”真嗣提议道。明日香同意了；直到鲸鱼开始狼吞虎咽地吃掉几磅重的鱼，她才意识到自己有多饿。

She chose the restaurant. It was a small café with tables set up outside and umbrellas to shade the occupants while they ate. Asuka opted for the salad this time, while Shinji wavered between two types of sandwiches and finally wound up getting one of each.  
她选了这家餐厅。这是一家小咖啡馆，外面摆着几张桌子，还有遮阳伞为用餐者挡住阳光。这次，明日香点了沙拉，而真嗣在两种三明治之间犹豫不决，最后决定各点一份。

"I'm hungry!" he protested teasingly.  
“我饿了！”他打趣地抗议道。

Asuka sat cross-legged, comfortably shaded by the umbrella, and watched people walk by. There was a short black metal fence separating the café from the rest of the park, and just beyond it several evergreen bushes flourished. She stabbed at a piece of tomato with her fork and chewed slowly, enjoying herself. Out on the brick path, an impatient child ran on ahead of his parents, throwing a stuffed animal dolphin into the air and catching it repeatedly.  
明日香盘腿坐着，惬意地躲在伞下，看着行人经过。一道矮矮的黑色金属栅栏将咖啡馆与公园的其他部分隔开，栅栏外几丛常青灌木茂盛地生长着。她用叉子戳起一块番茄，慢慢咀嚼，自得其乐。在砖砌的小路上，一个急躁的孩子跑在父母前面，不停地把一只填充海豚玩具抛向空中再接住。

Shinji followed her gaze, as he had done so many times that day. "You want one?"  
真嗣顺着她的目光望去，那天他已经这样做了无数次。“你想要一个吗？”

"Oh, no," she said, and turned back to her salad. They finished their meal in silence.  
“哦，不用了，”她说着，转回身继续吃她的沙拉。他们默默地吃完了饭。

"I'm going to use the restroom." Shinji stood up. "If the waiter comes, tell him to wait one moment."  
“我去一下洗手间。”真嗣站起身来。“如果服务员来了，告诉他稍等一下。”

Asuka nodded as Shinji disappeared into the gift shop alongside the café. Out of the corner of her eye she could see the waiter speaking courteously to another couple. _No, she thought, blushing furiously, we are not a couple—although I do like Shinji-kun very much—_  
明日香点头看着真嗣消失在礼品店与咖啡馆之间。眼角余光中，她瞥见服务员正礼貌地与另一对情侣交谈。不，她想，脸颊绯红，我们不是情侣——虽然我确实很喜欢真嗣君——

_Please wait one moment,_ she thought quickly, repeating the English words under her breath, so that she would be ready should the waiter happened to come by. _Please wait one moment..._  
请稍等片刻，她迅速在心中默念，重复着这句英语，以便服务员万一过来时她能应对。请稍等片刻...

"Would you like the check, miss?"  
“您需要结账吗，小姐？”

Asuka blinked. 明日香眨了眨眼。

"One moment," she managed to get out, and then added, "please..."  
“稍等一下，”她勉强说出，然后又补充道，“请……”

The waited nodded, not having noticed anything out of the ordinary, and hurried off to the next table. Asuka exhaled, noting that he did not bow, as any sensible Japanese would have done. She stretched her legs and let her sandals scrape on the brick-laid floor. She wondered what Misato was doing—then again, it was night in Tokyo-3, so Misato was presumably asleep.  
服务员点点头，并未察觉任何异常，急忙赶往下一桌。明日香松了口气，注意到他并未鞠躬，这是任何理智的日本人都会做的。她伸展双腿，让凉鞋在砖铺的地面上摩擦。她想知道美里在做什么——不过，第三新东京市正值夜晚，美里大概在睡觉吧。

Shinji returned a moment later, surprising her with his seemingly sudden appearance in front of her.  
真嗣一会儿就回来了，他突然出现在她面前，让她颇为惊讶。

= = = = = = =

They didn't head back until it was dark, and had it not been for the magical button on Shinji's keychain that caused the lights of his car to flash and beep, they might have been lost for a very long time. Asuka climbed into the passenger's seat and kicked off her shoes immediately. Shinji got in beside her and slammed the door.  
直到天黑他们才返回，要不是真嗣钥匙扣上的魔法按钮让车灯闪烁并发出哔哔声，他们可能已经迷路很久了。明日香爬上副驾驶座，立刻踢掉了鞋子。真嗣坐在她旁边，砰地一声关上了车门。

"Did you have fun today?" he asked, starting the engine. A vast array of lights flashed on across the dashboard; most faded to black within a matter of seconds.  
“今天玩得开心吗？”他启动引擎问道。仪表盘上闪过一大片灯光；大多数在几秒钟内就熄灭了。

"Yes," Asuka assured him. "I liked the flamingoes best."  
“是的，”明日香向他保证，“我最喜欢火烈鸟。”

"They were so smelly, though," Shinji muttered, wrinkling his nose in disgust. Asuka laughed.  
“不过它们真的很臭，”真嗣咕哝着，厌恶地皱起鼻子。明日香笑了。”

Silence. Moonlight draped a soft aura around Asuka's features.  
沉默。月光为明日香的容颜披上一层柔和的光晕。

"Tomorrow won't be nearly as fun," he reminded apologetically. "I have to work..."  
"明天不会那么有趣了，" 他带着歉意提醒道，"我得工作……"

"That's all right," Asuka insisted. "I'd like to see where you work... I still don't know exactly what you do."  
"没关系，" 明日香坚持说，"我想看看你工作的地方……我还是不太清楚你具体做什么。"

"You might not find it very interesting," he cautioned.  
"你可能会觉得不太有趣，" 他警告说。"

"That's fine." "那挺好的。"

Pause. 暂停。

When Shinji glanced at her again, Asuka was fast asleep, her chest rising and falling slowly with each breath. He noted the distance to the next rest station and pulled off the road as soon as he could.  
当真嗣再次瞥向她时，明日香已经熟睡，胸膛随着呼吸缓缓起伏。他注意到下一个休息站的距离，并尽快驶离了道路。

The former pilot of Eva Unit 01 walked to the back and unzipped his pack. From the largest compartment he removed a plastic bag, and from that, a stuffed animal dolphin, exactly like the one Asuka had watched another child handle. He shut the back door as quietly as he could and returned to his place in the driver's seat.  
前 Eva 初号机驾驶员走到车后，拉开背包的拉链。从最大的隔层中，他取出一个塑料袋，从中拿出一个填充动物海豚，与明日香曾见另一个孩子玩过的那个一模一样。他尽可能轻地关上后门，回到驾驶座的位置。

Asuka was facing towards him, and her sweet expression made him want to hold her as he gently tucked her arms around the toy. She mumbled a bit but didn't stir.  
明日香面向着他，她甜美的表情让他想抱住她，同时轻轻地将她的手臂环绕在玩具上。她含糊地嘟囔了几句，但没有醒来。

A hint of a smile crept onto Shinji's face as he restarted the engine.  
一丝微笑悄然爬上真嗣的脸庞，他重新启动了引擎。

Author's Notes: Guys I'm so sorry about the lateness of this chapter! I promise I'll try to update more often (I'm leaving for Japan and China on the 29th of June, so I'm hoping to finish it up before then).  
作者的话：各位，真的很抱歉这一章更新晚了！我保证会尽量多更新（我 6 月 29 号要去日本和中国，所以希望在那之前能完成）。

Writing this chapter was very much like writing a school report on "What did you do over the summer?" I tried to make it interesting, but the results were—well, evidently not the best. I haven't been to SeaWorld in about four years and I relied mainly on their website, so my apologies for any glaring errors I've made.  
写这一章的感觉非常像写学校报告，题目是“你暑假做了什么？”我尽力让它有趣，但结果嘛——显然不尽如人意。我已经大约四年没去过海洋世界了，主要依赖他们的网站信息，所以如有明显错误，敬请谅解。

Last time I was asked what language Asuka and Shinji communicate in. In general it's Japanese, since I figured that would be easier for Asuka, but I apparently forgot to explain where she learned English. Oops. Considering that she went to college in Germany and learned both German and Japanese, I assumed it was fairly reasonable that she had learned and been relatively fluent in English at the time of the series (roughly twelve years before this fanfic). Since she retained most of her Japanese after waking up, a sizeable amount of English came along as well, but recently she's been much more focused on speaking in Japanese than English, so it's taking our heroine a bit of effort to pick it back up.  
上次有人问我明日香和真嗣用什么语言交流。一般来说是日语，因为我觉得这对明日香来说更方便，但我显然忘了解释她是在哪里学会英语的。哎呀。考虑到她曾在德国上大学并学习了德语和日语，我假设她在系列开始时（大约是这部同人作品前十二年）已经学会了英语并且相当流利。自从她醒来后，她保留了大部分日语能力，同时也保留了相当一部分英语，但最近她更专注于用日语交流，所以我们的女主角需要一些努力来重新拾起英语。

Oh, and to Asuka201, I'll be emailing you soon!  
哦，对了，Asuka201，我很快会给你发邮件！

Wow, long author's note. Drop me a review and tell me how I'm doing. Sorry again for the delay!  
哇，好长的作者笔记。给我留个评论，告诉我做得怎么样。再次为延迟道歉！

### Chapter 17: Tuesday
He recognized her presence immediately, a pleasing change from the silent morning.  
他立刻认出了她的存在，与寂静的早晨相比，这让人感到愉悦的变化。

Despite having owned the house for nearly three years, he was rarely in it, preferring instead to work late into the night. Every once in awhile he would get carried away and wind up sleeping at his desk, bent over a stack of potential magazine covers. Obviously, Asuka wouldn't have taken to this habit very well, so Shinji had dusted the house from top to bottom and purchased some groceries before his arrival, attempting to give it some form of a vivacious theme.  
尽管已经拥有这栋房子近三年，他却很少待在里面，更喜欢工作到深夜。偶尔他会过于投入，最终趴在一堆潜在的杂志封面堆上睡着。显然，明日香不会对这种习惯感到满意，所以真嗣在她的到来之前，将房子从上到下打扫了一遍，并购买了一些食品杂货，试图给它增添一些生机勃勃的氛围。

Asuka lingered by the doorframe, her fingertips brushing against the smoothened wood. Shinji picked up the frying pan in one hand, skillfully flipped its contents with a spatula held in the other, and turned to face the redhead.  
明日香靠在门框边，指尖轻抚着光滑的木面。真嗣单手拿起煎锅，另一手持铲熟练地翻动着锅中的食物，随即转向红发少女。

"Good morning." “早上好。”

"Morning," she responded, making her way over to his side as he continued to cook. She sniffed thoughtfully—the mass of yellow, speckled with green and red was unfamiliar, but she liked the warm scent it was giving off.  
“早啊，”她应道，走向他的身旁，他继续烹饪。她若有所思地嗅了嗅——那团黄中带绿又点缀着红的混合物虽不熟悉，但其散发的温暖香气却让她心生好感。

"What is it?" "什么事？"

Shinji poked it and gave it a final flip. "A vegetable omelette." He slid it deftly onto a plate in front of her. The fork and knife followed with two twin clangs.  
真嗣轻轻戳了戳，最后翻了个面。“蔬菜欧姆蛋。”他熟练地将它滑到她的盘子里。叉子和刀随后落下，发出两声清脆的碰撞。

Asuka cut off a small corner and tasted it, nodding her approval. "What are the red and green spots?"  
明日香切下一小块尝了尝，点头表示满意。“那些红红绿绿的是什么？”

"The vegetables," Shinji explained, "tomatoes, peppers, onions, green beans, zucchini, mushrooms..."  
“蔬菜，”真嗣解释道，“西红柿、辣椒、洋葱、青豆、西葫芦、蘑菇……”

She ate while he made himself another one, stacking the mushrooms neatly in a pile on the left side of her plate. Asuka took her time and enjoyed herself. This was her favorite room of all—it lacked the overwhelming albeit elegant two-story windows of the living room—which would inevitably have whittled down her appetite. Instead, three pieces of glass had been placed at such angles that they jutted out of the wall in a trapezoidal shape, providing the redhead with a beautiful view of the land past Shinji's vast backyard.  
她边吃边看着他为自己再做了一份，将蘑菇整齐地堆叠在她盘子的左侧。明日香慢慢享用，乐在其中。这是她最喜欢的房间——它没有客厅那两层楼高的窗户，虽然优雅却让人感到压抑——那无疑会削弱她的食欲。取而代之的是，三块玻璃以特定角度嵌入墙壁，形成一个梯形凸出，为红发女孩提供了一幅越过真嗣广阔后院的美丽风景。

Shinji slid into place across from her, an identical steaming omelette on his plate. "You like the lake?"  
真嗣在她对面坐下，盘子里同样放着一份热气腾腾的煎蛋卷。“你喜欢这个湖吗？”

She nodded. It was by far the largest body of water she had ever seen, with the exception of the ocean, framed with a spray of various deciduous trees. A flock of geese took flight into the azure sky.  
她点点头。这是她见过的最大的水体，除了海洋之外，周围点缀着各种落叶树。一群鹅振翅飞向蔚蓝的天空。

"It's very beautiful," she remarked. "I couldn't have imagined this view from the front of the house."  
"非常美丽，" 她赞叹道。"我从未想象过从房子前面能看到这样的景色。"

"Mmfph." Shinji swallowed hard. "I'm lucky that this house was built on the top of a hill, and the lake is a good distance away. No flooding—I saw enough of that in Japan."  
"嗯嗯。" 真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。"我很幸运，这房子建在山顶上，湖离得也远。不会淹水——我在日本见够了那种景象。"

Asuka remembered the stories Misato had told her and nodded somberly.  
明日香回想起美里告诉她的那些故事，沉重地点了点头。

Shinji glanced at his watch and shoved the rest of his omelette down in one big gulp. "We should be leaving soon...excuse me." He pushed in his chair and placed his plate in the sink before hurrying off upstairs. Asuka willed herself to eat faster while savoring every bite. She wondered where Shinji had learned to cook.  
真嗣瞥了一眼手表，将剩下的煎蛋卷一口吞下。“我们该走了...失陪一下。”他推开椅子，把盘子放进水槽，然后匆匆上楼。明日香强迫自己吃得更快，同时细细品味每一口。她好奇真嗣是从哪儿学会做饭的。

_That's right,_ she thought suddenly, _I'll be meeting Kensuke today._ She wondered what the freckled camera boy would be like now. Asuka shoved the last bite into her mouth and hurried her plate to the sink.  
对了，她突然想到，今天我要见剑介。她想知道现在那个满脸雀斑的相机男孩会是什么样子。明日香把最后一口塞进嘴里，急忙把盘子送到水槽。

Shinji's plate had been left to soak in some soapy water, but Asuka didn't feel quite right placing hers there as well—the dirty plates would mar the cleanliness of the house. She glanced around and saw that he had cleaned up all the ingredients of their breakfast. Asuka reached for a sponge and began to scrub.  
真嗣的盘子泡在肥皂水里，但明日香觉得把她的也放进去不太合适——脏盘子会破坏房子的整洁。她环顾四周，发现他已经清理了早餐的所有食材。明日香拿起海绵开始擦洗。

"You don't need to do that."  
"你不需要这么做。"

Shinji had reappeared in the doorway, now dressed for work and fixing his tie. "Ready to go?"  
真嗣再次出现在门口，已经换上了工作装，正在整理领带。“准备好了吗？”

"I...I... I need to get ready," Asuka stuttered, thinking of the soapy water splattered on her blue skirt; however, a glance at the clock informed her that it was already past nine. Past time to go.  
"我...我... 我得准备一下，"明日香结巴着说，想起了溅在蓝色裙子上的肥皂水；然而，看了一眼时钟，她意识到已经过了九点。早就该出发了。

"You look fine," Shinji assured her. "I'm proud to be seen in the company of a girl as pretty as you."  
"你看起来很好，" 真嗣向她保证道。"能和一个像你这么漂亮的女孩一起被看到，我感到很自豪。"

Asuka blushed, dried her hands, and followed him out the door.  
明日香脸红了，擦干手，跟着他走出门去。

"So tell me more about your job," Shinji initiated, gracefully turning the corner after a long, straight road. A rubber ball bounced into the street and he quickly stopped, patiently waiting for the child to come pick it up. The boy gave him a wave, and Shinji returned the gesture.  
"再多跟我说说你的工作吧，" 真嗣提议道，优雅地在一个长长的直路后转过弯。一个橡皮球弹到了街上，他迅速停下，耐心地等待孩子来捡。男孩向他挥了挥手，真嗣也回以手势。

"Well, there's a girl who works with me, named Madoka." Asuka smiled, thinking of the girl's eager face upon learning that she was going to America. "She's worked there much longer than I have, and loves to experiment. Recently she came up with the idea of making starfruit ice cream—and for days the line was so long we couldn't close the door."  
"嗯，有个和我一起工作的女孩，叫 Madoka。" 明日香微笑着，想起女孩得知要去美国时那张充满期待的脸。"她在那里工作的时间比我长得多，而且喜欢尝试新花样。最近她想出了做杨桃冰淇淋的主意——那几天队伍排得老长，我们连门都关不上。"

"If only business for our magazine was that good..." Shinji mused, drawing a chuckle from the redhead. The sun shone brightly in his eyes and he fumbled in his bag for sunglasses. Asuka located them and handed to him. "Thanks. Too bad we don't have any of those ice cream parlors here. The only ice cream you can get is from the grocery store, made and frozen weeks ago."  
"要是我们杂志的销量也能那么好就好了..." 真嗣沉思道，逗得红发女孩轻笑出声。阳光直射进他的眼睛，他手忙脚乱地在包里找太阳镜。明日香找到了递给他。"谢谢。可惜这里没有那种冰淇淋店。唯一能买到的冰淇淋就是超市里的，几周前就做好了冻上的。"

"I love making ice cream," she confided. "Misato donated a cart of watermelons last week, and we made watermelon ice cream."  
"我喜欢做冰淇淋，" 她坦白道。"美里上周捐了一车西瓜，我们就做了西瓜冰淇淋。"

"I want watermelon ice cream." Shinji pretended to pout.  
"我要吃西瓜冰淇淋。" 真嗣假装撅嘴。

Asuka wished he had an ice cream maker. Then she would whip up gallons of fluffy, creamy dessert, garnished with small chunks of strawberry...  
明日香希望他有个冰淇淋机。那样她就能做出几加仑的松软奶油甜品，点缀着小块草莓……

= = = = = = =

"This whole building is yours?"  
"整栋楼都是你的？"

"No," Shinji laughed, "We rented an office upstairs; other businesses have their offices here as well." He removed the key from the ignition and tossed it in his pocket. It was a sunny day; Shinji had purposely parked the car in the shade so that it would be relatively cool when they returned.  
“不，”真嗣笑着说，“我们在楼上租了一间办公室；这里还有其他公司的办公室。”他拔出钥匙，扔进口袋。那天阳光明媚；真嗣特意把车停在阴凉处，这样他们回来时车里会比较凉快。

Every inch of floor was shiny and polished, and Asuka's shoes clicked neatly on the tiles. They took the elevator up to the ninth floor, and Asuka amused herself during the brief ride by examining her appearance in the ceiling, which consisted of one large rectangular mirror.  
每一寸地板都闪亮而光洁，明日香的鞋子在瓷砖上发出清脆的响声。他们乘电梯上到九楼，明日香在短暂的行程中自娱自乐，对着天花板上的大块矩形镜子审视自己的仪容。

With a welcoming ring, the doors slid open, and Asuka followed Shinji out onto the carpeted floor. The elegance and cheerfulness of the first floor was gone; here everything was deadly silent and very serious. She felt a sense of foreboding as Shinji walked smartly down the hallway, found the appropriate door, and unlocked it. Inside were several small cubicles and beyond it, roomed offices. The entire place was humming with activity; from where she stood in the doorway, Asuka could see people making phone calls, scribbling busily on a notepad, or typing at the computer.  
随着一声欢迎的铃声，门滑开了，明日香跟着真嗣走上了铺着地毯的地板。一楼的优雅和欢快消失了；这里一切都死寂而严肃。她感到一种不祥的预感，真嗣快步走过走廊，找到相应的门，并将其解锁。里面有几个小隔间，再往里是办公室。整个地方都充满了忙碌的气氛；站在门口的明日香可以看到人们正在打电话，忙碌地在便签本上书写，或在电脑前打字。

"Come on," Shinji called. Asuka shut the door behind her and followed. Several people called out morning salutations as they passed; Shinji lifted his hand in response and smiled. More than one of them cast surprised looks at Asuka, who felt very out of place.  
“快点，”真嗣喊道。明日香关上身后的门，跟了上去。他们经过时，几个人纷纷打招呼，真嗣举手回应并微笑。不少人惊讶地看着明日香，她感到自己格格不入。

Shinji stopped in front of a closed door. A short strip of metal was mounted upon the wood, and the name "Kensuke Aida" carved neatly into the shiny metallic surface. Shinji knocked sharply; Asuka heard, "Come in," and Shinji pushed open the door. A brown-haired man sat facing away from them, resizing photographs on his computer.  
真嗣停在一扇关着的门前。木头上固定着一条短金属条，上面整齐地刻着“相田剑介”的名字。真嗣用力敲了敲门；明日香听到“进来”，真嗣便推开了门。一个棕色头发的男人背对着他们，正在电脑上调整照片大小。

"Hey, Kensuke." “嘿，剑介。”

Kensuke turned slowly. His eyes went not to Shinji, but to Asuka, and widened considerably. He jumped out of his seat, upsetting his keyboard in the process. Asuka backed away quickly as Kensuke grabbed his camera and began snapping pictures of the redhead, all the while shouting "Sugoi! _SUGOI!_ She's here!"  
健介缓缓转过身。他的目光没有投向真嗣，而是转向了明日香，眼睛顿时瞪得老大。他猛地从座位上跳起来，键盘也因此被撞翻。明日香迅速后退，而健介抓起相机开始对着红发女孩狂拍，一边大喊着：“太厉害了！太厉害了！她来了！”

_"Kensuke_," Shinji muttered sharply, as every head in the office turned towards them. Asuka ducked behind Shinji in fright and stayed there.  
“健介，”真嗣低声严厉地说道，办公室里所有人的目光都转向了他们。明日香惊慌地躲到真嗣身后，一直待在那里。

"Sorry, got carried away." Kensuke lowered his camera sheepishly, a strawberry blush now slightly hiding the freckles. "Welcome to America, Asuka."  
“抱歉，有点失控了。”健介尴尬地放下相机，脸颊上泛起了一抹草莓般的红晕，稍微掩盖了些许雀斑。“欢迎来到美国，明日香。”

"Thanks," she replied, poking her head up over Shinji's shoulder.  
“谢谢，”她回答道，从真嗣的肩膀上方探出头来。

Shinji cleared his throat. "Kensuke, would you like to show Asuka some of your work?"  
真嗣清了清嗓子。“健介，你愿意给明日香看看你的作品吗？”

"Sure." He laid the camera down on its rest and pulled over another chair. Asuka hesitated, but Shinji promised not to be long—he had a meeting to attend to, and if she needed anything, his office was just next door.  
“当然可以。”他把相机放在支架上，又拉过来一把椅子。明日香有些犹豫，但真嗣保证不会太久——他有个会议要参加，如果她需要什么，他的办公室就在隔壁。

"And Kensuke, keep your camera away from her," he warned.  
“还有， Kensuke，把你的相机离她远点，”他警告道。

"Hai, hai!" Kensuke waved over his head. Shinji gave Asuka a final smile and closed the door.  
“嗨，嗨！” Kensuke 挥手回应。Shinji 最后向 Asuka 微笑了一下，然后关上了门。

Now completely alone with the boy who'd once spied on her in the changing room while taking pictures, Asuka slid tentatively into the seat he had prepared for her. It was soft and comfortable, with padded armrests.  
现在完全独自面对那个曾在更衣室偷拍她的男孩，Asuka 小心翼翼地滑入他为她准备的座位。座位柔软舒适，配有衬垫的扶手。

Kensuke was drawing up a folder labeled Brazil 2025. "Shinji and I made a trip to Brazil two years ago," he explained, "and spent three days trekking through the jungle with a guide. "Here's a pair of blue and gold macaws—they were placed on Brazil's Endangered Species List in 1981—very friendly birds, they just sat and let us photograph them as we wanted. Here—"he clicked on a picture of a large red parrot with green-blue fringes on its wings: "—this is a Green-winged macaw, also placed on the list in 1981—shame what's happening to the wildlife, really—look, Asuka, we had to hide in the trees and wait for nearly an hour to get this picture of the crocodiles—Shinji was almost going mad by then, but it was all worth it. This is one of my favorite pictures—" Kensuke scrolled down and selected another image: "—we'd spent all morning wading through the swamp, so we took a nice break in the park, and this big stork just waddled up out of nowhere—amazing, isn't it, how its feathers are split into such neat sections of color? Oh, and this monkey nearly made Shinji run to the airport and board a plane for home immediately—our guide had packed a box of fresh papayas and mangoes for lunch, but forgot to seal it—when we came back, this little fellow had already eaten a good majority of them—look, here's a papaya tree with ripe fruit—"  
健介正在整理一个标有“巴西 2025”的文件夹。“两年前，我和真嗣去了一趟巴西，”他解释道，“跟着向导在丛林里徒步了三天。”他指着一对蓝黄金刚鹦鹉的照片说：“它们在 1981 年被列入巴西濒危物种名单——非常友好的鸟儿，就那样静静地坐着，任由我们拍照。这里——”他点击了一张大型红鹦鹉的照片，其翅膀边缘呈蓝绿色：“——这是绿翅金刚鹦鹉，同样在 1981 年被列入名单——野生动物的现状真是令人惋惜，真的——看，明日香，为了拍到这张鳄鱼的照片，我们不得不躲在树丛中等待近一个小时——那时真嗣几乎要疯了，但一切都是值得的。这是我最喜欢的照片之一——”健介向下滚动并选中了另一张图片：“——我们整个上午都在沼泽中跋涉，于是在公园里好好休息了一下，这只大鹳就突然摇摇摆摆地出现了——真是神奇，它的羽毛竟然能分隔成如此整齐的颜色区块，对吧？”哦，还有这只猴子差点让真嗣直奔机场搭飞机回家——我们的导游打包了一箱新鲜的番木瓜和芒果作为午餐，却忘了封箱——等我们回来时，这个小家伙已经吃掉了大半——看，那里有一棵结满熟果的番木瓜树——

And so it went on. Nearly an hour later Kensuke had gone through his albums of not only Brazil but also the Great Barrier Reef and Tierra del Fuego, and would have gladly begun on another of Tahiti had Asuka not interrupted and kindly told him that she would like to see Shinji's office.  
就这样继续着。将近一个小时后， Kensuke 不仅翻完了巴西的相册，还有大堡礁和火地岛的，要不是 Asuka 打断并礼貌地表示想看看 Shinji 的办公室，他甚至准备开始展示塔希提的另一本。

She made her way across the hall, examining each of the unfamiliar lettering on the doors, until she came to one that read quite simply:  
她穿过走廊，仔细打量着每一扇门上不熟悉的文字，直到她来到一扇简单写着：

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

It was unlocked. She twisted the doorknob and entered.  
门没有上锁。她转动门把手，走了进去。

Much like his house, every nook and cranny was perfectly clean and organized. It was rather small but cozy, with a couch and coffee table facing her. His desk was to her left, and above it hung a variety of certificates. On her right side, two identical bookcases stood tightly against the wall. A variety of hanging plants draped long tendrils over the top shelf.  
和他的房子一样，每个角落都干净整洁得无可挑剔。房间虽小却很温馨，一张沙发和咖啡桌正对着她。他的书桌在她左边，上方挂着各种证书。右边是两个紧贴墙壁的相同书架。各种悬挂植物的藤蔓垂挂在最上层的架子上。

Asuka seated herself in his swiveling leather chair, feeling very small. The back was several inches higher than her head. She kicked her legs, to no avail; finally she grabbed the edge of the desk and pulled. The chair slid forward.  
明日香坐在他的旋转皮椅上，感觉自己异常渺小。椅背比她的头高出好几英寸。她踢了踢腿，无济于事；最后她抓住桌边，用力一拉。椅子向前滑去。

His desk was covered with stacks of paper, each neat and organized. In the corner she recognized the magazine which he had used to invite her to America. Beside it was another older issue, with the picture of the two blue and gold macaws Kensuke had showed off earlier splashed across its cover.  
他的桌上堆满了整齐有序的文件。在角落里，她认出了那本他用以邀请她来美国的杂志。旁边是另一本更早的期刊，封面上的两只蓝金相间的金刚鹦鹉正是之前健介炫耀过的那对。

In front of her lay a pile of papers that had been neatly paper clipped together and labeled "Pending Articles."  
她面前是一叠用回形针整齐夹好并标有“待处理文章”的文件。

"Having fun?" "玩得开心吗？"

Asuka jumped at Shinji's voice.  
真嗣的声音让明日香吓了一跳。

He came over to her side. Asuka was terrified that he would be angry with her for looking through his things, but instead his face broke into a grin. "Did you like the article on Belladonna lilies?"  
他走到她身边。明日香害怕他会因为她翻看他的东西而生气，但他却露出了笑容。“你喜欢那篇关于孤挺花的文章吗？”

"I didn't get to read it yet," she admitted.  
"我还没来得及读呢，"她坦白道。

"Then I have an idea."  
"那我有个主意。"

Several minutes later they were both seated comfortably on the squashy couch, a variety of articles spread out over the table. Asuka's job was to read each of them and decide whether or not she liked it, and based on that decision Shinji would decide whether or not to publish it.  
几分钟后，两人舒适地坐在柔软的沙发上，桌上摊开了各种文章。明日香的任务是阅读每一篇并决定是否喜欢，而根据她的决定，真嗣将决定是否出版它们。

"Is this what you do in a usual day?" Asuka asked.  
“你平时都做这些吗？”明日香问道。

Shinji shrugged. "It's almost time for another publication, so we held a meeting to settle on the cover story," he explained. "I don't have a consistent schedule that I can stick to daily—sometimes I read articles and decide which ones to publish, sometimes I edit them or send them back to the writer, and other times I look through pictures. Of course, once in awhile I go on a trip with Kensuke and other photographers."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“又快到下一期出版的时间了，所以我们开了个会来定封面故事，”他解释道，“我没有固定的日常安排——有时候我会阅读文章并决定哪些要发表，有时候我会编辑它们或发回给作者，还有时候我会浏览图片。当然，偶尔我也会和健介以及其他摄影师一起出去采风。”

Asuka thought this over and decided she preferred ice cream making any day.  
明日香想了想，觉得她还是更喜欢做冰淇淋。

"What's the cover story for this month?" she asked.  
“这个月的封面故事是什么？”她问道。

Shinji opened up his briefcase and produced a manila folder. The redhead opened it to find an article on Costa Rican rain frogs. The photographs had already been selected and clipped to the first page.  
真嗣打开公文包，拿出一个牛皮纸文件夹。红发女孩打开它，发现里面是一篇关于哥斯达黎加雨蛙的文章。照片已经选好并夹在了第一页。

_The general life cycle of a common frog begins with the spawn, a mass of eggs in which the embryos develop. Hatching occurs between 6 and 21 days, producing hundreds of tiny tailed tadpoles, which eventually develop legs and grow to resemble an adult frog. These then disperse into the world and produce more eggs to complete the cycle.  
普通青蛙的生命周期始于卵团，这是胚胎发育的卵块。孵化发生在 6 到 21 天之间，产生数百只带尾巴的小蝌蚪，它们最终会长出腿并成长为类似成年青蛙的形态。然后它们分散到世界各地，产下更多卵，完成生命循环。_

_The Costa Rican rain frog bypasses the tadpole stage, however, by laying eggs that contain fully developed albeit tiny froglets...  
哥斯达黎加雨蛙通过产下含有已发育但微小的蛙宝宝的卵来跳过蝌蚪阶段..._

Asuka looked up. Shinji was perusing another article, but sensed her discomfort and met her gaze. "What's wrong?"  
明日香抬头望去。真嗣正在阅读另一篇文章，但察觉到她的不适，便与她对视。“怎么了？”

"Shinji, what's a tadpole?"  
“真嗣，什么是蝌蚪？”

He gave her the Japanese name, but she still didn't seem to understand.  
他给了她一个日本名字，但她似乎仍然不明白。  
_  
I can't help him read articles,  
我无法帮他读懂文章，_Asuka thought, disappointed, _because I don't know these terms. If only my English was better..._  
明日香心想，失望地，因为我对这些术语一窍不通。要是我的英语再好些就好了...

But Shinji had another idea. "I know your English is good enough to give you the general idea of each article. Why don't you look through the pictures and decide which would fit best with which article?"  
但真嗣有另一个主意。“我知道你的英语水平足以让你大致理解每篇文章的内容。为什么不浏览一下图片，然后决定哪张图片最适合哪篇文章呢？”

She liked that idea, and quickly got to work.  
她喜欢这个主意，并迅速投入工作。

= = = = = = =

"What did you think of my job, now that you've gotten to experience it firsthand?"  
“现在你亲身体验了我的工作，你觉得怎么样？”

Asuka thought wistfully of Madoka and her starfruit ice cream and chose her response carefully. "It's very interesting to be able to work with so many people...and visit places like—" she had to think to remember the Spanish name: "Tierra del Fuego."  
明日香怀念地想起了小圆和她那星果冰淇淋，小心翼翼地选择回应。“能和这么多人一起工作……还能去到像——”她努力回忆着那个西班牙语名字：“火地岛。”

"Did Kensuke show you his pictures of the penguins?"  
“真希波给你看过他的企鹅照片吗？”

"Yes, and many more." “是的，还有很多。”

Shinji laughed. He reached into his pocket and handed his keyring to Asuka. By now, the ritual didn't need words: Asuka took it from him, found the correct button, and pressed it firmly with her thumb. His car emitted a loud beep and flashed its lights.  
真嗣笑了。他伸手从口袋里掏出钥匙串递给明日香。到了现在，这个仪式已经不需要言语：明日香从他手中接过，找到正确的按钮，用拇指坚定地按了下去。他的车发出一声响亮的哔声，车灯也随之闪烁。

"What will we be doing tomorrow?" she asked, as they slid into their respective seats. He held out a hand for the keys and she gave them to him.  
“我们明天要做什么？”她问道，两人各自滑入座位。他伸出手要钥匙，她便递给了他。

"Sleep." Shinji started the engine. "I'm tired, and you're tired, and I can tell you're still suffering from jet lag. If we feel like it we can drive out to the beach in the afternoon."  
“睡觉。”真嗣启动了引擎。“我累了，你也累了，我能看出你还在倒时差。如果我们觉得可以，下午可以开车去海边。”

"I didn't bring a swimsuit," she faltered.  
"我没带泳衣，"她犹豫地说。

"No matter, we'll go buy one."  
"没关系，我们去买点。"

Asuka began to argue, but he was insistent.  
明日香开始争辩，但他坚持己见。

She was silent by the time they reached his house. Shinji glanced at the redhead. Asuka was resting her head against the window, not moving. A pang of guilt swept over Shinji—he'd managed to exhaust her yesterday and thoroughly bore her today.  
当他们到达他的家时，她已经沉默了。真嗣瞥了一眼红发女孩。明日香正将头靠在车窗上，一动不动。一阵内疚感袭上真嗣心头——昨天他让她筋疲力尽，今天又让她彻底感到无聊。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Mm."

"Are you all right?" "你还好吗？"

She smiled at him then, and he relaxed. "Of course. Why wouldn't I be?"  
她随即对他微笑，他放松下来。“当然，我怎么会不在呢？”

He handed her the keyring, and she locked all the doors. Then, with her heels clicking on the stone path and his feet making no sounds at all, they went home.  
他递给她钥匙圈，她锁上了所有的门。然后，随着她的高跟鞋在石板路上发出声响，而他的脚步却悄无声息，他们一起回家了。

Author's Note: I remember getting a question awhile back on what Shinji actually did, so I added a bit of insight into that, and we meet Kensuke for the first time.  
作者的话：我记得之前有人问过真嗣到底做了什么，所以我在这里稍微透露了一些内情，同时这也是我们第一次见到健介。

Asuka201—my email's being stupid, so I'll just post here what I was originally planning to email: I'm very impressed that you'd like to translate my story into Chinese, and of course you may do so. I'd like to request that you mention my name and add a link to this fanfiction when you post it, and send me a link to your translation so I can add it to the beginning of this story. Thank you!  
Asuka201——我的邮箱出了点问题，所以我会在这里发布我原本打算通过邮件发送的内容：我非常荣幸您想将我的故事翻译成中文，当然您可以这么做。我希望您在发布时能提及我的名字并附上这篇同人文的链接，同时请将您的翻译链接发给我，以便我将其添加到故事开头。谢谢您！

And thank you to everyone who's been reviewing! You all are the greatest!  
同时感谢所有留下评论的朋友们！你们是最棒的！

### Chapter 18: Wednesday
"Don't you have to go back to work soon?"  
“你不是很快就得回去工作了吗？”

Misato flashed a grin. "Luckily for me, Ritsuko, my hours are much more flexible than yours. Besides, it's much too lonely without Asuka around."  
美里露出一丝笑容。“幸运的是，律子，我的工作时间比你灵活多了。而且，没有明日香在身边，实在太寂寞了。”

The blonde sighed and picked up her bag. "All right then...have fun." She stepped into her high heels and wriggled her toes. "Don't get too rowdy."  
金发女子叹了口气，拿起她的包。“好吧……玩得开心。”她穿上高跟鞋，扭动着脚趾。“别太疯了。”

"Jeez, Ritsuko... loosen up!"  
“天哪，律子……放松点！”

The doctor rolled her eyes and left.  
医生翻了个白眼，离开了。  
_  
I could almost imagine we were back in college, if only...  
我几乎可以想象我们回到了大学时代，只要..._ Misato shook her head and twisted the doorknob to make sure it was locked, even as the clicks of Ritsuko's heels disappeared down the stairs.  
美里摇了摇头，扭动门把手确保门已锁好，尽管此时律子的鞋跟声已消失在楼梯下。

She'd been here for three days now, taking over Ritsuko's house. Despite the blonde's cool exterior, she sensed that her old friend enjoyed her company; they had sat up taking late into the nights and eating watermelon ice cream (Misato reminded herself to tell Asuka not to bring anymore home, as she was thoroughly sick of it.) Monday and Tuesday had been relatively conservative days in which Ritsuko went to work and Misato cooked and cleaned. Despite the doctor's preference for sanitation, lack of sleep had won over, and her cleaning habits had promptly gone out the window.  
她已经在这里住了三天，接管了律子的家。尽管金发女子外表冷静，但她感觉到老朋友喜欢她的陪伴；她们熬夜至深夜，吃着西瓜冰淇淋（美里提醒自己告诉明日香不要再带回家了，因为她已经彻底吃腻了。）周一和周二相对保守，律子去上班，美里则做饭和打扫。尽管医生偏好清洁，但睡眠不足占了上风，她的清洁习惯很快就抛诸脑后了。

But Misato was tired of vinegar and detergent, and today she intended to have some fun.  
但美里已经厌倦了醋和清洁剂的味道，今天她打算好好享受一番。

She had not visited downtown Kyoto in years. In May of 2010 she had been dispatched to tour a small facility there; the plan had been to construct certain Evangelion parts there, but for reasons unknown to her, Commander Ikari and Vice Commander Fuyutsuki had denied it. That day had been rainy and humid, and Misato remembered little of the actual city—not that it would have mattered, since Kyoto had undergone mass infrastructure changes since then.  
她已有多年未曾踏足京都市中心。2010 年 5 月，她曾被派往那里参观一个小型设施；原计划是在那里制造某些 EVA 部件，但不知为何，碇司令和副司令冬月却否决了这一计划。那天的雨湿漉漉的，空气闷热，美里对那座城市的实际印象寥寥无几——即便记得，也无甚意义，因为自那时起，京都的基础设施已发生了翻天覆地的变化。

Having never returned Ritsuko's key, Misato used it to lock the door after she exited. She wore high heels similar to Ritsuko's, and a stylish navy blue skirt complimented by a matching summery shirt. The hair she left down, feeling that the less white hairs showed, the better. Perhaps it was time to try dyeing it—surely Ritsuko would have some advice in that direction.  
美里一直未归还赤木律子的钥匙，出门后便用它锁上了门。她穿着与赤木律子相似的高跟鞋，一条时尚的海军蓝裙子搭配着同色系的夏日衬衫。她让头发自然垂下，心想白发露得越少越好。或许该尝试染发了——赤木律子在这方面肯定能给出不少建议。

Misato opened the last door and a wave of sunlight streamed into the dark apartment. The soundproof door had blocked nearly all of the noise generated from traffic and children, and Misato was suddenly very eager to become a part of it.  
美里推开最后一扇门，一束阳光涌入昏暗的公寓。隔音门几乎隔绝了所有来自交通和孩子们的噪音，美里突然非常渴望成为其中的一部分。

She walked, leaving her car in the parking lot, swinging her small handbag with her left hand. It was made of plastic, in a pattern of that consisted of two vertical pink stripes and one white one between them. The bag was barely large enough to fit a handgun in it, and that was how Misato liked it. The only things she carried within it were her money and a small compact mirror. She drew up to a small outdoor café and sat down, ordering a cup of tea. In her younger days, college, perhaps, she would have gone out drinking late into the night with Kaji and Ritsuko, who always attempted to maintain a firm stance on her refusal to drink but eventually giving in.  
她步行离开停车场，左手摆动着她的小手提包。这个包是塑料制的，图案是两条竖直的粉红色条纹和它们之间的一条白色条纹。包的容量仅够装下一支手枪，而这正是美里喜欢的。她包里唯一携带的东西是她的钱和一个小巧的化妆镜。她走到一家户外咖啡馆坐下，点了一杯茶。在她年轻的时候，也许是大学时期，她会和加持以及律子深夜出去喝酒，律子总是试图坚持她不喝酒的立场，但最终还是会妥协。

"Hey." “嘿。”

Misato turned, but didn't need to—the guy slid directly into the seat across from her. She was slightly taken aback at first, but relaxed into a smile. She was here to have fun, after all.  
美里转过身，但并不需要——那家伙直接滑进了她对面的座位。她起初有些惊讶，但随即放松下来，露出了微笑。毕竟，她来这里是找乐子的。

"Hey yourself." “你也好。”

The guy chuckled and waved his hand at the waiter, ordering another cup of tea. Misato tossed her hair back in what she hoped was a confident way. She wasn't sure of herself anymore—she had come out of Ritsuko's drab little room to enjoy herself, but _damn_—she was forty-one years old already, and flirting didn't come so easily to her. Nor was it any fun, now that she had "grown up". Misato was disappointed.  
那家伙轻声笑了笑，向服务员挥手又要了一杯茶。美里甩了甩头发，希望自己看起来自信满满。她不再那么确定自己——她走出律子那间单调的小房间，是为了享受生活，但该死——她已经四十一岁了，调情对她来说不再那么容易。而且现在她已经“长大成人”，调情也不再有趣。美里感到失望。

But she didn't feel comfortable telling him to leave, either, so she did neither.  
但她也不觉得告诉他离开会舒服，所以她什么也没做。

He was watching her closely, which made her all the more uneasy. "What's your name?"  
他正紧紧地盯着她，这让她更加不安。“你叫什么名字？”

Pause. 暂停。

"Misato." “美里。”

"Misato huh?" He spoke with a faint accent that suggested he wasn't native to neither Tokyo nor Kyoto. "How would you like to come over tonight?" His arm was snaking around her slender waist, and Misato was surprised to discover that she was quivering from not fright, but anger.  
“美里啊？”他说话带着一丝口音，暗示着他既非东京也非京都的本地人。“今晚想不想来我家？”他的手臂正悄悄环上她纤细的腰肢，美里惊讶地发现自己颤抖并非因为恐惧，而是愤怒。

"GET OFF OF ME!" “放开我！”

And to the shock of the entire café, she promptly delivered a punch to his face that knocked him off his chair and followed it up with a kick. The metal chair was up over her head and would shortly have landed on top of the poor man had someone not taken a firm hold of her right arm.  
令整个咖啡馆震惊的是，她迅速一拳打在他的脸上，将他击倒在地，紧接着又是一脚。金属椅子被她举过头顶，眼看就要砸在那可怜人身上，幸好有人紧紧抓住了她的右臂。

"Hey." For the second time, Misato turned. This time, however, she was staring directly at a police badge. "Put that chair down."  
“嘿。” 这是第二次，Misato 转过身来。然而这一次，她的目光直接对上了一枚警徽。“把那椅子放下。”

Slowly she obeyed, not taking her eyes off of his stern face.  
她慢慢地照做了，目光始终没有离开他严肃的脸庞。

The officer's eyes strayed to the man writhing on the ground. "Are you all right?"  
警官的目光转向了地上扭动着的男子。“你还好吗？”

He got to his feet, glaring at Misato, and began spewing out curses. The officer rolled his eyes in aggravation, handcuffed both of them, and led them to his car. Behind them, the shushed chatter started up again.  
他站起身来，怒视着美里，开始咒骂。警官不耐烦地翻了个白眼，给他们戴上了手铐，并把他们带到自己的车上。在他们身后，窃窃私语再次响起。

Misato glanced at her watch, twisting her head around to do so. It was only 9:00 AM. She sighed. This was going to be a long day.  
美里瞥了一眼手表，扭头去看时间。才早上 9 点。她叹了口气。这将是个漫长的一天。

= = = = = = =

"Shinji? Is that you?" “真嗣？是你吗？”

He heard her voice and panicked, found the nearest cupboard, and shoved his purchases on top of whatever was inside. "Asuka?"  
他听到她的声音，慌了神，找到最近的橱柜，把买的东西一股脑塞进里面。“明日香？”

She fumbled for a light switch, found it, and lit the room. "I thought you went to bed."  
她摸索着找到电灯开关，一按，房间亮了起来。“我以为你已经睡了。”

"I did. I... left something at the office and had to drive back for it."  
“我是睡了。我……把东西落在办公室了，不得不开车回去取。”

"Oh." Asuka yawned. Shinji sighed mentally, relieved that she'd bought his excuse. "Sorry... I'm going back to bed now."  
"哦。" 明日香打了个哈欠。真嗣在心里松了口气，庆幸她接受了他的借口。"对不起... 我现在要回去睡觉了。"

"Don't worry, you can sleep in as late as you can tomorrow," he assured her. "Whenever you wake up we can go swimsuit shopping and then we'll go to the beach."  
"别担心，明天你可以睡到自然醒，" 他向她保证。"无论你什么时候醒来，我们都可以去买泳衣，然后去海滩。"

Asuka nodded, too tired to argue.  
明日香点点头，太累了以至于不想争论。

When she had disappeared back into her room and her footsteps had ceased, Shinji reached into the cupboard and pulled out the bags. From them he removed one brand new ice cream maker and several cartons of fresh strawberries. Shinji left the ice cream maker on the counter and rummaged around the refrigerator, trying to find room for the strawberries.  
当她消失在房间里，脚步声也停止后，真嗣伸手从橱柜里拿出几个袋子。他从里面取出了一台全新的冰淇淋机和几盒新鲜的草莓。真嗣把冰淇淋机放在厨房台面上，又在冰箱里翻找，试图为草莓腾出空间。

= = = = = = =

"You can't put me in jail!"  
“你不能把我关进监狱！”

"Until we get this cleared up, we are. And believe me, lady, I'm not enjoying this any more than you are." The door slid shut and the guard walked away, muttering under his breath.  
“在我们把事情弄清楚之前，我们会的。相信我，女士，我跟你一样不享受这个过程。”门滑动着关上了，警卫一边走开，一边低声嘀咕着。

Misato was tempted to shout after him, but decided not to—she really didn't want to stay here any longer than she had to. Her gaze shifted slowly to the other inmates, fortunately all of whom were female. She looked down at her hands, which were now free.  
美里本想朝他大喊，但还是决定不这么做——她真的不想在这里多待一秒钟。她的目光缓缓转向其他囚犯，幸运的是，她们都是女性。她低头看着自己的双手，现在它们已经自由了。

The former Major avoided looking at her fellow inmates, four of them in all, shivering to think what Ikari Gendo would say if he saw her now. _Damn it, if only they hadn't taken my cell phone... I could call Ritsuko, or maybe even Asuka..._  
前少校避免看向她的狱友们，一共四人，她颤抖着想象如果碇源堂看到她现在的样子会说些什么。该死，如果他们没有拿走我的手机...我本可以打给律子，或者甚至是明日香...

"Hey." For the third (and she hoped last) time, Misato turned in response to the same greeting. One of the women lifted her chin in her direction. "So, what have _you_ done?"  
“嘿。”这是第三次（也是她希望的最后一次），美里听到同样的问候后转过身来。其中一个女人向她抬了抬下巴。“那么，你做了什么？”

"I...well... beat up a guy," she admitted.  
"我...嗯...揍了一个家伙，"她承认道。

This drew an admiring sound from the rest of the women, all of whom quickly insisted that Misato tell them the full story. Rather reluctantly she did, preferring that they hear the story from her lips than from one of the jailers. She wondered what had happened to the guy who had been arrested with her, but decided she didn't care.  
这引起了其他女性的赞叹声，她们都急切地要求美里讲述完整的故事。美里相当不情愿地照做了，宁愿她们从她口中听到故事，而不是从狱卒那里。她想知道和她一起被捕的那个家伙怎么样了，但决定她并不关心。

"Tough girl," commented another woman, making a clucking sound in the back of her throat. Misato glanced at her and edged away—she was beginning to feel some fear despite their admiration for her; this particular inmate had long dark hair sticking in all directions, some matted down across her shoulders and throat. Much to Misato's horror, she laughed and pulled her closer with a long bony arm. "Come now, don't be shy."  
"真是个硬茬，"另一个女人评论道，喉咙里发出咯咯声。美里瞥了她一眼，稍稍挪开——尽管她们对她表示赞赏，她开始感到一些恐惧；这个特定的囚犯有着一头乱糟糟的长黑发，有些纠结地披在肩上和脖子上。令美里惊恐的是，她大笑着用一条瘦长的胳膊把她拉近。"来吧，别害羞。"

Misato would have liked nothing more than to squirm away; the unoccupied corner of the metal bench looked like a haven to her.  
美里最希望的莫过于逃离这里；那张金属长椅未被占据的一角对她来说宛如避风港。

_I need a phone...I need to call Ritsuko!  
我需要一部电话...我得打给律子！_

She glanced through the sturdy metal bars that made up the door. They were on the second floor, in what she expected was a temporary holding room—none of them yet had been made to change into the white shirt and orange pants that all prisoners were required to wear. Misato thought of Ritsuko's advice and groaned; most likely the doctor wouldn't be at all surprised to find the apartment empty and wouldn't send out a search party even if she didn't come home for three days.  
她透过坚固的金属栏杆门向外望去。他们位于二楼，她猜测这是个临时拘留室——他们还没有被要求换上所有囚犯都必须穿的白色衬衫和橙色裤子。美里想起律子的建议，不禁呻吟起来；那位医生多半不会对空无一人的公寓感到惊讶，即使她三天不回家，也不会派出搜寻队。

Misato looked at her watch again and rubbed the sore parts of her wrist where the metal of the handcuffs had dug deep into the skin. It was now 10:30 AM.  
美里再次看了看手表，揉了揉手腕上被手铐金属深深勒入的酸痛部位。现在已经是上午 10 点 30 分。

Thankfully the woman chose to release her. "She's getting bored. Tell her what you did." The command was followed by another nod.  
幸运的是，那女人决定释放她。“她开始觉得无聊了。告诉她你做了什么。”命令之后又是一个点头。

Thus began a long tirade of stories about how each of them had managed to land herself in jail, ranging from excessive speeding to shoplifting. Misato didn't find any of them particularly amusing and had to exercise extreme self-control to keep herself from glancing at her watch constantly. It was 10:34. She had to know...  
于是，一场关于她们各自如何入狱的长篇大论开始了，从超速行驶到偷窃商店，无所不包。美里并不觉得这些故事有什么特别有趣的地方，她不得不极力克制自己，以免不停地看手表。现在是 10 点 34 分。她必须知道...

"Hey," she ventured cautiously, "when you came in here, did they let you made any phone calls?"  
"嘿，" 她小心翼翼地试探，"你进来的时候，他们让你打电话了吗？"

The long-haired woman snorted. "Haven't got anyone to call."  
那位长发女子嗤之以鼻。"没人可联系。"

"Me neither," another replied.  
"我也是，" 另一个人回答道。"

_Damn._

Misato slouched down low and crossed her arms and legs.  
美里懒洋洋地瘫坐在椅子上，双臂和双腿交叠。

_So much for a fun day.  
看来今天的好心情是泡汤了。_

= = = = = = =

Ritsuko was feeling very jealous of Misato at the moment. She had been called into her employer's office and given a full lecture on being ten minutes late—the morning fog and rush hour had made no difference whatsoever; if anything, it had lengthened the lecture. Next, one of her colleagues had come rushing into her room in a near panic, unable to find the blueprints desired by a client. Consequently, Ritsuko's entire morning had been spent poring over a mountain of manila folders and stray files. Back in the days of Nerv, this had been Misato's job, and Ritsuko had commonly teased her about it. Those words came back to haunt her now, as she pulled out yet another file.  
此时此刻，律子对美里充满了嫉妒。她被叫到老板的办公室，接受了一番关于迟到十分钟的训话——早上的雾气和高峰时段对她毫无同情；相反，这似乎让训话变得更长了。接着，一位同事近乎恐慌地冲进她的房间，找不到客户想要的蓝图。结果，律子整个上午都在一堆马尼拉文件夹和散乱的文件中苦苦寻找。在 NERV 时期，这是美里的工作，而律子经常拿这事取笑她。如今，这些话回荡在耳边，她又抽出了一份文件。

Someone called out from her office, and Ritsuko recognized her as the one who had been panicked about blueprints—_damn it, why isn't_ she _here looking?_—calling her.  
有人从她的办公室喊道，Ritsuko 认出那是之前为蓝图慌张的那位——该死，她怎么不在这儿找？——呼唤着她。

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"Your phone's ringing." “你的电话响了。”

"Well then, let it ring."  
“那就让它响吧。”

"...all right..." "...好吧..."

She had been waiting, craving, yearning for the lunch break, but when that hour came her manager stopped in and coolly informed her that he was sending his secretary out to buy lunches for the entire staff and needed her order. Of course it wouldn't do to have a dismayed client, so she was to remain in the storage room, searching for that missing blueprint.  
她一直盼望着，渴望着，期待着午休时间的到来，但当那一刻真的来临时，她的经理却突然走进来，冷静地告诉她，他要派秘书出去为全体员工买午餐，并需要她的订单。当然，不能让客户感到失望，所以她得留在储藏室里，寻找那份失踪的蓝图。

When lunch finally came, Ritsuko ripped off the plastic wrapping and tore hungrily into it, not tasting anything, and certainly not giving a thought to the flashing answering machine on her desk.  
当午餐终于送到时，律子撕开塑料包装，狼吞虎咽地吃了起来，什么味道也没尝出来，更别提她桌上那闪烁的答录机了。

= = = = = = =

"Damn you, Ritsuko!" "该死的，律子！"

However, Misato knew better than to slam the phone down on the receiver. She'd been waiting—what, three hours?—for her chance, and Ritsuko had to leave her office in that one precious moment.  
然而，美里知道不能就这样挂断电话。她已经等了——多久，三个小时？——就为了这个机会，而律子偏偏就在那关键的一刻离开了办公室。

She stole a glance at the fat guard in charge of the phone. He was busy talking with another stern-faced guard. Misato picked up the receiver again and quickly pressed the buttons that would—hopefully—somehow—get her out of here.  
她偷偷瞥了一眼负责电话的胖警卫。他正忙着和另一个表情严肃的警卫交谈。美里再次拿起听筒，迅速按下那些按钮，希望能以某种方式——无论如何——让她离开这里。

She shifted her weight from one leg to the other, waiting impatiently.  
她不耐烦地从一只脚换到另一只脚，等待着。

Asuka awoke briefly and groggily reached for the light. Had there been a faint ring, or was she imagining it? Asuka listened as intently as she could in her present state, decided she had been dreaming, and shut off the light. She pulled the covers over her head and went back to sleep.  
明日香短暂地醒来，昏昏沉沉地伸手去开灯。是隐约的铃声，还是她在想象？明日香尽力在她现在的状态下倾听，决定自己是在做梦，然后关掉了灯。她把被子拉过头，又睡着了。

= = = = = = =

"Hey." The voice she heard on the line was most certainly not Asuka's—it was most certainly male. "This call is being monitored—and you've already made more than your allotted number of calls."  
“嘿。”电话那头的声音显然不是明日香的——那明显是个男声。“这次通话正在被监控——而且你已经超过了允许的通话次数。”

_Click. 咔哒。_

Sadly Misato replaced the receiver and allowed the guard to lead her back to her cell, where the other four inmates were waiting eagerly for news.  
米萨托遗憾地放下听筒，任由警卫将她带回牢房，其他四名囚犯正急切地等待着消息。

"So? Who'd you call?" “那么？你给谁打电话了？”

"Are they coming to get you?"  
"他们要来抓你吗？"

"No," Misato muttered, ignoring the first question as she sank back into her own spot by the door. The metal bench was icy cold and hard.  
"不，" 美里嘟囔着，对第一个问题置之不理，她退回到门旁的自己的位置。金属长椅冰冷而坚硬。

"At least you had someone to call," one of them offered kindly.  
"至少你还有人可以联系，" 其中一人善意地提议道。

Despairingly Misato looked into her face and was surprised to see a mixture of sympathy and sadness. "What happened to—to your—?"  
"绝望中，美里凝视着她的脸庞，惊讶地发现那混合着同情与悲伤的神情。“发生了什么——你的——？””

She shrugged, not minding the purple-haired woman's directness. "All dead."  
"她耸了耸肩，并不介意这位紫发女子的直率。“全都死了。””

"I'm sorry," Misato quickly apologized.  
“我很抱歉，”美里迅速道歉道。

"Doesn't matter. So, who'd you call?"  
"没关系。那么，你给谁打电话了？"

"My friend," she admitted quietly, knowing it would lead to a discussion about her parents. Misato steeled herself, knowing it wouldn't be easy to relive the memories of the Katsuragi expedition, of the quarrels between her mother and father, how he had died to save her...  
"我的朋友，""她轻声承认，知道这将引发关于她父母的讨论。美里鼓起勇气，知道重温葛城探险队的记忆不会容易，回忆起母亲和父亲之间的争吵，他如何为救她而牺牲...

= = = = = = =

"I think this one would look nice on you."  
"我觉得这件你穿起来会很好看。"

Shinji looked so funny holding up an orange bathing suit that Asuka had to laugh. "That would make me look like a huge fireball...!"  
真嗣拿着一件橙色泳衣的样子太滑稽了，就连明日香也忍不住笑出声来。“那会让我看起来像个大火球...！”

"Oh." Shinji replaced it on the rack. Asuka found a one-piece in several shades of blue, evidently designed to look like ripples or water. "How does this one look?"  
“哦。”真嗣把它放回了架子上。明日香找到了一件多色蓝调的连体泳衣，显然设计成波纹或水流的样子。“这件怎么样？”

"Go try it on," he urged.  
“去试试吧，”他催促道。

Ten minutes later they left the store, Asuka carrying her suit in a small plastic bag. Shinji stopped en route to the beach to pick up another sack of oranges and several bottles of water. Much to his surprise (and delight), Asuka had found the ice cream maker and was already churning out fluffy pink ice cream garnished with chunks of real strawberries by the time he entered the kitchen that morning. The dessert had been packaged and now lay in a cooler at Asuka's feet.  
十分钟后，他们离开了商店，明日香手里提着一个小塑料袋，里面装着她的泳衣。真嗣在去海滩的路上停下来，又买了一袋橙子和几瓶水。令他惊讶（也令他高兴）的是，明日香找到了冰淇淋机，当他早上走进厨房时，她已经在制作点缀着新鲜草莓块的蓬松粉色冰淇淋了。甜点已经打包好，现在正躺在明日香脚边的冷却器里。

Asuka glanced at the clock—it was nearly noon. She suggested that they eat lunch on the sand first, then go into the water; Shinji liked this idea and parked quickly by the side of the road. From the front of the car Asuka pulled out the cooler containing their lunches and ice cream, and from the back Shinji removed their towels, beach chairs, and an enormous rainbow- colored umbrella.  
明日香瞥了一眼时钟——快到中午了。她建议他们先在沙滩上吃午饭，然后再下水；真嗣喜欢这个主意，迅速把车停在了路边。明日香从车前拿出装有他们午餐和冰淇淋的冷却器，而真嗣从车后取出了他们的毛巾、沙滩椅和一把巨大的彩虹色雨伞。

The redhead squealed when she first stepped onto the sand, feeling it give way under her feet. Shinji laughed and kicked off his sandals. Asuka followed his example and half-hopped, half-skipped down to the edge of the water, yelping at the burning sensation on the soles of her feet. Shinji set up the umbrella and spread out their beach towels in the shade.  
红发女孩初次踏上沙滩时尖叫起来，感受着沙子在脚下陷落。真嗣笑着踢掉了他的凉鞋。明日香效仿他，半跳半跑地来到水边，脚底灼热的触感让她惊叫连连。真嗣撑起遮阳伞，在阴凉处铺开了他们的沙滩巾。

By then Asuka had changed her mind, and was running full speed into the ocean waves while Shinji sat lazily on the beach and ate his way through three sandwiches. Twenty minutes later she ran back up to him, dripping with seawater, clutching several large white shells in her hands.  
那时明日香改变了主意，全速冲进海浪中，而真嗣则懒洋洋地坐在沙滩上，吃掉了三个三明治。二十分钟后，她带着一身海水跑回他身边，手里紧握着几个大白贝壳。

Shinji laughed at her and pulled out the ice cream.  
真嗣笑着拿出冰淇淋。

= = = = = = =

"Took you long enough, damn it."  
"你可真慢，该死的。"

"Oh shut up. I had to work all day and then come pick you up from jail. We're lucky you got off with just a fine."  
"闭嘴吧。我得工作一整天，然后还得来监狱接你。你只被罚了款，算我们走运了。"

"You sound like a guard yourself," Misato grumbled.  
"你听起来像个狱警似的，"美里咕哝道。"

Ritsuko muttered something indistinguishable under her breath. In the dim moonlight, Misato couldn't see the dark circles under her friend's eyes—not that she chose to, either.  
律子低声咕哝着什么，模糊不清。在昏暗的月光下，美里看不清朋友眼下的黑眼圈——她也没打算去看。

"I see you didn't take the advice I gave you this morning."  
“看来你没把我今早的建议放在心上。”

"Oh shut up." “哦，闭嘴吧。”

Ritsuko snickered and increased pressure on the accelerator. Her car shot off into the distance, leaving the dreary jail far behind until it vanished from view.  
律子嗤笑一声，加大了油门。她的车疾驰而去，将阴沉的监狱远远甩在身后，直至消失不见。

Author's Notes: I decided this time to elaborate more on Misato, since I completely left her out of the last two chapters, and Shinji and Asuka are having a very relaxed day... not particularly a happy day for Misato, but an adventurous one, nevertheless. I'm not sure if I made this clear—due to the time changes, when it's night in Japan it's day in California—I'm not sure of the exact difference in times, so I've left it at twelve hours.  
作者笔记：这次我决定更多地展开对美里姐的描写，因为前两章我完全忽略了她的存在，而真嗣和明日香正度过一个非常轻松的日子……对美里来说并不特别快乐，但无论如何是个充满冒险的日子。我不确定是否已经说清楚——由于时差变化，当日本是夜晚时，加州是白天——我不确定确切的时差，所以我设定为十二小时。

To Asuka201: I've taken a look at your translation—I can't read much Chinese, but it looks very nice! And thank you for adding my name and a link to this story, I'll be adding your translation to the first page of this story too.  
致 Asuka201：我看了你的翻译——虽然我看不懂中文，但它看起来很棒！谢谢你添加了我的名字和这个故事的链接，我也会把你的翻译加到这个故事的首页。

Oh yeah, another trivia question: I mentioned that Misato's bag was small and barely large enough to fit a handgun in it, with two vertical pink stripes and one white one between the two. To which anime character does this bag actually belong?  
哦对了，再来个冷知识问题：我提到过 Misato 的包很小，勉强能装下一支手枪，上面有两条竖着的粉色条纹和一条白色的条纹。这个包实际上属于哪个动漫角色呢？

Thanks guys for all your reviews!  
感谢大家的所有评论！

### Chapter 19: Thursday
Asuka woke up Thursday morning with a headache. _Perhaps it was just the position I slept in, she thought dazedly._ The redhead pulled the blanket over her head and tried again to sleep.  
明日香在星期四早上醒来时头痛欲裂。也许只是睡姿不好吧，她迷迷糊糊地想着。红发女孩拉起被子蒙住头，试图再次入睡。

She came up a moment later for air.  
她过了一会儿才浮上水面换气。

Asuka tossed the blanket back and widened her eyes. The large spring-green curtains were drawn back with matching ribbons, providing her with a vast view of the lake outside. She lay in her bed and watched a bird flutter down to her windowsill and cock its head as it eyed her curiously. The redhead shifted her position and the bird disappeared with a distinctive, shrill call. Sunlight streamed in and cast elongated shadows of her window, chairs, and dresser.  
明日香掀开毯子，睁大了眼睛。宽大的春绿色窗帘被同色系的丝带拉开，让她得以一览湖外的美景。她躺在床上，看着一只鸟儿扑腾着飞到窗台上，歪着头好奇地打量着她。红发少女调整了一下姿势，那只鸟便发出一声尖锐的鸣叫消失了。阳光倾泻而入，将窗户、椅子和梳妆台的影子拉得长长的。

Everything matched in this room. The curtains and bed were matching shades of pale green; the seat covers of the chairs were made of dark green leather. There was a small tree in the corner with delicate leaves, its trunk consisting of three separate parts braided together. The floor was light-colored hardwood. There were no paintings on the snow-white walls.  
这个房间里的一切都搭配得恰到好处。窗帘和床都是浅绿色的；椅子的座套是用深绿色皮革制成的。角落里有一棵小树，叶子纤细，树干由三部分编织而成。地板是浅色的硬木。雪白的墙壁上没有挂任何画作。

She got out of bed and made her way to her suitcase, which rested on top of the short dresser. There was a closet near her bed, but since she would only be here for a week, Asuka hadn't seen a need to unpack and hang things up. She chose the dress Hazuki-san had given her before she left the hospital, a summery gown of pale pink with ripe red strawberries sprinkled across it. Asuka smoothed out the fabric with her hands, and the pattern reminded her of the leftover ice cream in the refrigerator. She was hungry.  
她从床上起身，走向放在矮衣柜顶上的行李箱。床边有个衣橱，但因为只住一个星期，明日香觉得没必要打开行李挂衣服。她选了出院前风见志保送给她的那条裙子，一件浅粉色的夏日长裙，上面点缀着熟透的红草莓。明日香用手抚平布料，图案让她想起了冰箱里剩下的冰淇淋。她饿了。

Her bare feet pattered on the wooden floor across the hallway. Shinji's door was wide open, as were the windows; his curtains—which were blue—billowed in the wind. The bed was made. Clearly he had left some time ago.  
她赤脚走过木地板，穿过走廊。真嗣的房门大开着，窗户也是；他的窗帘——蓝色的——在风中飘动。床铺整理得井井有条。显然他已经离开一段时间了。

She revived a bit over a bowl of ice cream that she ate leisurely, seated on a rotating stool before a tall, immovable table in the center of the kitchen with jade counters rubbed so shiny she could see her reflection. Shinji had left a note for her, telling her that he had gone to a meeting at work and would be home in a couple of hours. During this time, she was to do as she pleased. He had added the time—8:00 AM. Asuka glanced up at the digital clock of his oven. The time was 9:42, displayed neatly in blood- red numerals.  
她坐在厨房中央一张高高的、固定不动的旋转凳上，悠闲地吃着一碗冰淇淋，感觉精神恢复了一些。厨房的玉石台面擦得锃亮，她甚至能从中看到自己的倒影。真嗣给她留了张字条，告诉她自己去上班开会了，几个小时后就会回来。这段时间她可以随心所欲。他还特意注明了时间——早上 8 点。明日香抬头看了一眼他烤箱上的数字时钟，显示的时间是 9 点 42 分，用鲜红的数字整齐地展示着。

Asuka wiped a speck of ice cream off of the counter and rinsed out her bowl. It wasn't too late—perhaps she'd try calling Misato. She hadn't talked with her former commander since arriving in California.  
明日香擦掉台面上的一点冰淇淋，清洗了自己的碗。时间还不算晚——也许她可以试着给美里打电话。自从来到加州后，她还没和这位前指挥官聊过。

She got only the answering machine, so she tried her cell phone. Asuka walked around the first floor as it rang, finally settling on a simple but comfortable leather bound green sofa in the living room. She spread out her body and stretched. There was a leafy plant placed against the end, and the tips of its leaves tickled her toes.  
她只听到了语音信箱的提示，于是又尝试拨打她的手机。明日香在底楼四处走动，电话铃声响起，最终她选择了一张简单却舒适的绿色皮沙发坐下。她舒展开身体，伸了个懒腰。沙发尽头摆放着一盆绿叶植物，叶尖轻轻挠着她的脚趾。

"Katsuragi." "葛城。"

"Hey, Misato," Asuka said, a smile breaking over her face at the familiar voice.  
"嘿，美里，" 明日香听到熟悉的声音，脸上绽放出笑容。"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"How are you doing?" "你还好吗？"

Pause. 暂停。

"Well... I just got out of jail twenty-four hours ago..."  
“嗯... 我二十四小时前刚从监狱出来...”

Asuka sweat-dropped. 明日香汗颜。

"What did you do, Misato?!"  
"你做了什么，美里？"

As simply as she could, Misato related the story of how she had landed in jail and how the day had passed. Asuka listened intently, an amused smile coming over her face. She heard voices in the background with Misato paused and asked, "Who's that?"  
美里尽可能简单地讲述了她是如何入狱的，以及那天是如何度过的。明日香专注地听着，脸上浮现出有趣的笑容。当美里停顿下来时，她听到背景中有声音，便问道：“那是谁？”

"Ritsuko. I'm in Kyoto." "是律子。我在京都。"

"Tell her I said hi."  
“告诉她我向她问好。”

Misato relayed the message. "So how have you and _Shinji_ been?"  
美里转达了这句话。“那么你和真嗣最近怎么样？”

She blushed furiously, thankful that she was alone and no one could see her. "We are _fine_, Misato, just _fine_," she said, accenting each "fine". "We went to SeaWorld on the first day. Tuesday I went to work with him, and yesterday we were at the beach."  
她脸红得厉害，庆幸自己一个人，没人能看到她。“我们很好，美里，真的很好，”她强调每一个“很好”。“第一天我们去了海洋世界。周二我跟他去上班，昨天我们在海滩。”

"Oh, so _that's_ why you weren't answering your phone..." Misato muttered, before remembering the time difference.  
"哦，难怪你不接电话..." 美里咕哝着，随后想起了时差。

"What?" "什么？"

"Nothing. Can I talk to Shinji?"  
"没什么。我可以和真嗣说话吗？"

"He went to work." "他去上班了。"

"Oh. Hey, Asuka, have you gotten a chance to wear that black dress we bought yet?"  
"哦，嘿，明日香，你有机会穿上我们买的那件黑色礼服了吗？"

"Not yet," Asuka admitted, "although tonight Kensuke is holding a fancy dinner party tonight, so we'll be dressing up."  
"还没呢，""明日香承认道，""不过今晚健介要举办一个正式的晚宴，所以我们得盛装出席。"

"You've met Kensuke?" "你见过健介了？"

"Yes..." Asuka retold the story of the hour she had spent in his room, being forced to look through all the pictures he had taken of Brazil and Tierra del Fuego. "He really hasn't changed at all, Misato."  
"是的..." 明日香讲述了她在他的房间里被迫度过的一小时，翻看他拍摄的巴西和火地岛的所有照片。"他真的一点都没变，美里。"

Misato was silent. 美里沉默了。

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Yeah. I was just thinking."  
"嗯。我只是在想。"

Asuka decided to change the topic. "Will you be in Tokyo-3 by the time I come back?"  
明日香决定换个话题。“我回来的时候，你会待在第三新东京市吗？”

"Definitely." “当然会。”

= = = = = = =

By 4:00, the weather had taken an ominous turn for the worse. Shadowy clouds were rolling overhead and every room in the house was dark. Even Shinji had turned his laptop off and unplugged it, not wanting to lose his data in the event of an electrical outage. Asuka stood in front of the two- story window, pressing her nose against the cold glass. The rain began to pour down in huge sheets.  
到了四点钟，天气变得愈发不祥。乌云密布，整个房子都暗了下来。甚至连真嗣也关掉了笔记本电脑并拔掉了插头，以防在停电时丢失数据。明日香站在两层楼高的窗前，鼻子紧贴着冰冷的玻璃。大雨开始倾盆而下。

"What time does the party start, Shinji?" she asked.  
"聚会几点开始，真嗣？" 她问道。

He was spread out on the couch. "Six."  
他摊开在沙发上。"六点。"  
_  
Surely it'll stop by then,  
那时肯定停了，_ she thought. But at five the sky remained just as dark, and Shinji announced that he was going up to change. Asuka retired to her room upstairs as well.  
她心想。但到了五点，天空依旧一片漆黑，真嗣宣布他要上楼去换衣服。明日香也回到楼上的房间。

Her window was closed, but raindrops thudded against it, and the fragile wire mesh panel shook with their fury. She turned on a light and began to rummage through her suitcase for the dress. It was in the very bottom, at the upper left corner, someplace where the movement of other clothes wouldn't have disturbed it. Asuka drew it out and shook it to loosen all the folds. Perhaps there would be time to iron it.  
她的窗户紧闭，但雨滴重重地敲打在玻璃上，脆弱的金属网板在雨水的冲击下颤动。她打开灯，开始在行李箱里翻找那件裙子。它就在最底下，左上角的位置，其他衣物移动时不会影响到它。明日香把它拿出来，抖了抖以松开所有的褶皱。或许还有时间熨烫一下。

The skirt was unusually thick. Asuka frowned and took hold of the outside layer, giving it a firm shake. A pile of dark aqua silk glided to the floor. A note was pinned to the top.  
裙子的布料异常厚实。明日香皱了皱眉，抓住外层，用力一抖。一堆深青色的丝绸滑落到地板上。一张纸条别在最上面。

_Hope you have fun – Misato  
希望你玩得开心 – 美里_

There it was—the beautiful gown she had seen while shopping with Misato in Tokyo, the one that had been perfect for her, whose cost had been much higher than her price range. Misato had evidently sneaked out and purchased it for her without her knowing. Asuka held the skirt up and rubbed the soft material against her cheek. It was an inexplicable feeling, she thought, laying it down, that Misato had done this for her. Gratitude and poignancy welled up inside her and blended into excitement. She ran to Shinji's room.  
那件美丽的礼服就在眼前——她曾在东京与美里逛街时见过的，完美适合她的那件，价格远超她的预算。显然，美里偷偷出去买下了它，而她毫不知情。明日香拿起裙摆，轻轻摩挲着柔软的布料贴在脸颊上。她觉得这是一种难以言喻的感觉，放下裙子时，心中涌起了对美里的感激与辛酸，混合成了兴奋。她跑向真嗣的房间。

"Shinji, do you have an ironing board?"  
“真嗣，你有熨衣板吗？”

"Yeah, it's in the closet downstairs." His voice was muffled and faint, as it was coming from a steaming bathroom amidst water droplets. "Do you need any help?"  
"嗯，在楼下衣柜里。"他的声音被浴室里的蒸汽和水珠模糊了，显得微弱。"需要帮忙吗？"

"I think I can figure it out."  
"我觉得我能搞定。"

She'd only seen Misato iron her clothes a few times—usually when she had to work the next day and had run out of clean clothes. Asuka filled up the iron with water and plugged it in, thinking that a power outage wouldn't hurt in this case. When it was hot enough—she tested this cautiously by flicking a few droplets of water onto the metal surface—she spread out the skirt and moved the iron up and down over the fabric.  
她只见过美里熨过几次衣服——通常是第二天要上班，而干净衣服又用完了的时候。明日香给熨斗装满水，插上电源，心想这时候停电也无所谓。等到熨斗足够热了——她小心翼翼地弹了几滴水到金属表面测试——她展开裙子，来回移动熨斗熨烫布料。

Asuka showered and put on the dress, feeling like a princess. Misato was her fairy godmother, who had guaranteed her a night to remember.  
明日香洗完澡，穿上那条裙子，感觉自己像个公主。美里就像是她的仙女教母，确保她有一个难忘的夜晚。

Nervously she reached for her hairbrush and drew it through the copper tresses. It wasn't that she was nervous about Kensuke—she'd met him already—but the other people that would be there. Surely she would be asked where she was from, what she did for a living, etc. Asuka took a deep breath and smoothed out her skirt. _I can do this—I can be calm and composed; I can be a normal person._  
她紧张地拿起梳子，梳理着那头铜色的秀发。倒不是因为对健介感到紧张——她已经见过他了——而是因为那些在场的人。肯定有人会问她来自哪里，做什么工作等等。明日香深吸一口气，抚平了裙摆。我能做到——我可以保持冷静和镇定；我可以成为一个普通人。

"Asuka, are you ready?" “明日香，你准备好了吗？”

She didn't want to keep him waiting. "Yes, I'm coming."  
她不想让他久等。“是的，我来了。”

He was waiting for her at the bottom of the staircase, dressed semi- formally in a nice shirt and pants. Asuka reached for the railing and began to make her way downstairs. On the third step she tripped and tumbled to the bottom.  
他在楼梯底部等她，穿着半正式的衬衫和裤子。明日香伸手抓住扶手，开始下楼。在第三级台阶上，她绊了一下，滚到了底部。

"Ouch..." “哎哟...”

"Are you all right?" "你还好吗？"

"I'm fine." Asuka faced away from him deliberately; she didn't want him to see how nervous she was. She checked her skirt for tears and found none.  
"我没事。" 明日香故意背对着他；她不想让他看到自己有多紧张。她检查了一下裙子有没有破，发现没有。

Shinji looked outside with disappointment. The rain was still pouring, and his car was parked a good distance away from the front door. They ran for it, Shinji unlocking his car (instead of handing the keyring to Asuka as he usually did) to save time. He turned on the windshield wipers and they began to hum merrily as they swept across the glass.  
真嗣失望地望向窗外。雨还在下，他的车停在离前门相当远的地方。他们跑过去，真嗣解锁了车（没有像平时那样把钥匙圈递给明日香）以节省时间。他打开了雨刷，它们开始欢快地摆动，扫过玻璃。

Asuka looked away. She placed her head against the window, thinking of what she might say when she was asked questions. She had never yet had to introduce herself to anyone, except for the children around Misato's house... and that hardly counted. They were all too happy to accept her readily for what she was.  
明日香转过头去。她将头靠在窗户上，思索着当被问及问题时她可能会说些什么。她从未向任何人介绍过自己，除了美里家周围的孩子们……而这几乎不算数。他们都非常乐意欣然接受她本来的样子。  
_  
Where am I from? Tokyo-3.  
我来自哪里？第三新东京市。_ Smile and nod. _I was a friend of Shinji's when we were children._  
微笑并点头。我们小时候是真嗣的朋友。

_What do I do? I work in an ice cream parlor in Tokyo-3_. Asuka jerked out of her reciting reverie for a moment. These would all be people who occupied important positions in the management of the magazine—would they think differently of her if they knew she simply made ice cream? Asuka was scared for herself, and for Shinji. Surely, she thought, blushing as she did so, people would ask if they were a couple. She had to answer no—could she do that without blushing?  
我该怎么办？我在第三新东京市的一家冰淇淋店工作。明日香从她的背诵沉思中猛地回过神来。这些人都是杂志管理层的重要人物——如果他们知道她只是个做冰淇淋的，会怎么看她？明日香为自己，也为真嗣感到害怕。她想，脸红着，人们肯定会问他们是不是一对。她必须回答不是——她能在不脸红的情况下做到吗？

"What are you thinking, Asuka?" Shinji asked. "You're awfully red—are you feeling okay?"  
“你在想什么，明日香？”真嗣问。“你脸红得厉害——感觉还好吗？”

"Yes. Are we almost there?"  
“嗯。我们快到了吗？”

"We have a little while to go."  
“我们还有一小段路要走。”  
_  
I should have put on some makeup,  
“我应该化点妆的，”_ Asuka thought, glancing unhappily at her reflection in the passenger mirror. She had never done anything of the sort, but Misato had tucked a lipstick into the side of her bag at the last minute. She was certain that all the women would have their makeup done nicely and she would be...well, plain.  
明日香心想，不悦地瞥了一眼乘客镜中的自己。她从未做过这种事，但美里在最后一刻往她的包侧塞了一支口红。她确信所有女性都会化好妆，而她将会是……呃，平凡无奇。

And on top of all this lay the issue of her English. She didn't look very Japanese, but nor did she look distinctly American. In the last few days her grammar had improved immensely. She hoped that it would be good enough.  
除此之外，她的英语问题也让她头疼。她看起来不太像日本人，但也并非典型的美国人。最近几天，她的语法有了显著的进步。她希望这已经足够好了。

Shinji placed a hand on hers. "Don't worry," he assured her. "You'll be fine."  
真嗣把手放在她的手上。“别担心，”他安慰她，“你会没事的。”

= = = = = = =

The sky was black by the time they reached Kensuke's house. It was smaller than Shinji's, but with all the sounds and light of merriment, it appeared very cozy indeed.  
当他们到达健介家时，天色已经全黑了。房子比真嗣的小，但充满了欢声笑语和灯光，显得格外温馨。

Asuka stepped over a puddle and walked alongside Shinji; he had brought a bottle of fancy wine as a gift and let her carry it. The door was unlocked and Shinji, obviously having been here many times, let himself in.  
明日香跨过一个水坑，与真嗣并肩而行；他带了一瓶高档红酒作为礼物，让她拿着。门没有上锁，真嗣显然来过很多次，便自顾自地进去了。

"Hey, Shinji!" Kensuke called over the sea of heads, waving an arm. Shinji returned the gesture.  
“嘿，真嗣！”在人群中，健介挥着手喊道。真嗣也挥手回应。

"Ah well, he seems quite preoccupied right now," Shinji remarked. "Maybe we'll hang on to the wine until a little later."  
“唉，他现在似乎很忙，”真嗣说道，“也许我们晚点再喝这瓶酒吧。”

Asuka nodded. Her head was swimming from the noise. People were everywhere, the men in formal clothing, the ladies all in dresses—all of which were black. She began to feel uncomfortable in her green dress.  
明日香点点头。嘈杂声让她头晕目眩。人群中，男士们身着正装，女士们则一律穿着黑色礼服。她开始觉得自己的绿色连衣裙显得格格不入。

"Shinji!" A slightly balding man sauntered up to them, his arm around a lovely blonde young woman. He nodded towards her. "My wife, Daria."  
“真嗣！”一个略微秃顶的男人悠闲地走向他们，手臂搂着一位美丽的金发年轻女子。他向她点头示意。“我的妻子，达莉亚。”

Daria extended a hand to Shinji, and then to Asuka. Her picture-perfect smile never faltered. "Hi."  
达莉亚向真嗣伸出手，接着又向明日香伸出手。她那完美的微笑始终未曾动摇。“嗨。”

"I'm—I'm Asuka," the redhead said.  
"我是——我是明日香，"红发女孩说道。

Daria smiled. "Come over here and get something to eat. The men will start talking business affairs in a moment." She held a martini glass in her hands, and along the way plunked it down on a counter with other used glasses. "Asuka, I just love your dress. It goes so nicely with your eyes."  
达莉亚微笑着说："过来吃点东西吧。男人们一会儿就要开始谈生意了。"她手里拿着一杯马提尼，顺手放在了其他用过的杯子旁边。"明日香，我太喜欢你的裙子了。和你的眼睛真是绝配。"

"Thank you." Feeling braver, "I like yours too."  
"谢谢你。"明日香鼓起勇气说，"我也喜欢你的。"

Daria laughed. "Well, you know, it's been hanging in the back of the closet for years." She took a paper plate and piled it high with fresh fruit and gestured to the redhead. "Oh go on, Asuka, don't be shy."  
Daria 笑了。“嗯，你知道，它在衣橱后面挂了好几年了。”她拿起一个纸盘子，堆满了新鲜水果，并向红发女孩示意。“哦，去吧，Asuka，别害羞。”

"All right." Asuka picked up a plate and followed her example, picking up some grapes, chicken, and several slices of apples. They made their way to another room filled with chattering ladies; Asuka glanced over at Shinji but he was already hidden somewhere in the crowd of people.  
“好吧。”Asuka 拿起一个盘子，照着她的样子，拿了些葡萄、鸡肉和几片苹果。她们走进另一个房间，那里满是聊天的女士们；Asuka 瞥了一眼 Shinji，但他已经消失在人群中。

Daria selected an empty couch and sat down on one end while Asuka took the other. "Ladies, this is Asuka, Shinji's—"  
Daria 选了一个空沙发，坐在一头，而 Asuka 坐在另一头。“女士们，这是 Asuka，Shinji 的——”

"Friend," Asuka supplied quickly, hoping that any bright colors on her face would be hidden in the dim light. She took a bite of her chicken and found it cold and juicy.  
"朋友，" 明日香迅速接口，希望昏暗的光线能掩盖她脸上的红晕。她咬了一口鸡肉，发现它又冷又多汁。

"It's nice to meet you, Asuka," the women told her warmly, and introduced each other amidst much laughter. Daria put an arm around the redhead's shoulder and pulled her closer.  
"很高兴见到你，明日香，" 女士们热情地对她说，并在笑声中互相介绍。达莉亚搂住红发女孩的肩膀，将她拉近了些。

One of them placed down her plate and chewed thoughtfully for a moment. "You know, when I was a little girl, I always wanted red hair. I've tried dying mine several times, but it's never looked nearly as natural as yours."  
其中一位放下盘子，若有所思地咀嚼了一会儿。"你知道吗，我小时候一直想要红头发。我试过好几次染发，但从来都没有你的这么自然。"

"Asuka's hair is natural, Marie," Daria chipped in, and the women marveled at the color. "Doesn't it go perfectly with her dress?"  
“玛丽，明日香的发色是天生的，”达莉亚插话道，女人们惊叹于这颜色。“和她的裙子是不是很搭？”  
_  
They're showering me with compliments,  
他们正对我赞不绝口，_ Asuka realized. _Is this normal, or are they just being nice?_  
明日香意识到。这是常态，还是他们只是出于礼貌？

"Are you just visiting Shinji, or do you live near?"  
"你是来拜访真嗣的，还是住在这附近？"

"I'm just visiting. I live in Tokyo-3."  
"我只是来访。我住在第三新东京市。"

"Tokyo-3!" Daria looked at her companion with admiration. "I've always wanted to visit there. I hope Steve gets an assignment there sometime so I can tag along."  
"第三新东京市！" 达莉亚带着敬佩的目光看向她的同伴。"我一直想去那里看看。希望史蒂夫什么时候能去那里出差，这样我就可以跟着去了。"

"What do you do there?"  
“你在那里做什么？”

"I..." Asuka faltered. She had been afraid of this. "I work in an ice cream parlor."  
“我……” 明日香犹豫了。她一直害怕这个问题。“我在一家冰淇淋店工作。”

The ladies exchanged secretive looks. _Oh no,_ thought Asuka, _I've said something wrong. What am I going to do?_  
女士们交换了神秘的眼神。哦不，明日香心想，我说错话了。我该怎么办？

Just as she was about to break out in explanations, Marie stood up and announced, "Well ladies, I believe we've found someone who'll know how to work that contraption."  
就在她即将爆发出解释之际，玛丽站起身来宣布：“好了，女士们，我相信我们已经找到了一个会操作那玩意儿的人。”

"What con—contrap—?" Asuka asked, having not quite grasped the word.  
“什么玩——玩意——？”明日香问道，还没完全理解那个词。

Daria stood up as well. "Kensuke bought himself a homemade ice cream maker," she explained, "but couldn't figure out how to work it."  
达莉亚也站了起来。“健介给自己买了一台自制的冰淇淋机，”她解释道，“但他搞不懂怎么操作。”

Marie took Asuka by the elbow and led her to the kitchen. The machine was still in its packaging, but the lid stuck out as if someone had hurriedly shoved it back into the box and not bothered to align things neatly. Asuka took the pieces out, assembled them, and plugged it in. Daria was pulling ingredients out of the refrigerator. "There's the cream, sugar, eggs, milk... what else do we need, Asuka?"  
玛丽抓住明日香的手肘，带她来到厨房。机器还裹在包装里，但盖子突出来，像是有人急忙塞回去，没费心整理整齐。明日香取出零件，组装好，插上电源。达莉亚正从冰箱里拿出食材。“奶油、糖、鸡蛋、牛奶……我们还需要什么，明日香？”

"Some fruit would be nice." Asuka was feeling more and more at home as her fingertips ran over the familiar machinery. "Is there any specific type of ice cream we need to make?"  
“加点水果会不错。”明日香的手指在熟悉的机械上滑过，感觉越来越自在。“我们需要做特定种类的冰淇淋吗？”

"He didn't say," Daria said. "Shall I just bring you some of everything?"  
“他没说，”达莉亚说。“我是不是该把所有的都给你拿一些？”

"Yes, that would be nice."  
"是的，那会很好。"

Marie was leaning against the counter, propped up on one elbow. "You really know this stuff well," she commented.  
玛丽正倚靠在柜台上，一只胳膊肘撑着。“你真的很懂这些，”她评论道。

"Practice makes perfect," Asuka quoted, drawing a chuckle from the lady. "In Japan... there are only two of us working in the store, so we are always very busy."  
"熟能生巧，"明日香引用道，逗得女士轻笑。"在日本...店里只有我们两个人，所以我们总是很忙。"

"If I ever come to Tokyo-3, I'll be sure to stop by," Marie chuckled. "Mmm, it smells good already."  
"如果我哪天来到第三新东京市，一定会来拜访，" 玛丽轻笑道，"嗯，光是闻着就觉得很香了。"

Daria reappeared with several plates of various fruit. Asuka picked over the green grapes and slices of kiwi before making her decision and announcing it with a smile.  
达莉亚再次出现，手里端着几盘各式各样的水果。明日香仔细挑选了绿葡萄和奇异果切片，最后带着微笑做出了决定。

"Put some of everything in."  
"每样都放一些吧。"

= = = = = = =

"Did you have fun, Asuka?"  
"你玩得开心吗，明日香？"

"Yes," she replied brightly. Her ice cream had been an instant hit; Kensuke had been amazed to taste the products of a machine he was about to return, and all the ladies had clamored around to see how it worked. Daria had announced proudly that Asuka worked in an ice cream parlor in Tokyo-3, and anyone who visited Japan had to stop by. Kensuke was delighted with the wine, and Asuka had been proud that she had gathered the courage to present it to him herself. Most of all she was pleased that the women had accepted her as one of them; she hadn't felt the least bit like an outsider.  
"是的，"她兴高采烈地回答。她的冰淇淋立刻大受欢迎；健介对即将归还的机器能制作出如此美味感到惊讶，所有女士们都围拢过来想看看它是如何工作的。达莉亚自豪地宣布明日香在东京-3 的一家冰淇淋店工作，任何去日本的人都必须去看看。健介对那瓶酒非常满意，明日香也为她鼓起勇气亲自呈上而感到自豪。最重要的是，她很高兴女士们接纳了她，她没有感到一丝一毫的局外人感觉。

"And what did you think of Daria?"  
"那你觉得达莉亚怎么样？"

"She's a lovely woman," Asuka replied without thinking, in English. Shinji burst out laughing.  
"她是个可爱的女人，" 明日香不假思索地用英语回答。真嗣爆发出笑声。

"I'm glad you had fun." He ruffled her hair. "It's done wonders for your English."  
"很高兴你玩得开心。" 他揉乱了她的头发。"你的英语进步神速。"

Asuka grinned, but then a twinge of sadness pulled at her. Today was Thursday; then there were just Friday and Saturday and she would have to leave for Japan Sunday night. Then again, the next two days would be wonderful—she could trust that to Shinji. He was right about this night doing wonders for her English—but it had done wonders for something else, too, her confidence.  
明日香咧嘴一笑，但随即一丝悲伤袭上心头。今天是星期四；接下来只有星期五和星期六，她就得在星期天晚上离开去日本了。不过，接下来的两天将会很美好——她可以相信真嗣。他说的没错，这个晚上对她的英语大有裨益——但它还对其他东西产生了奇效，她的自信心。

Asuka smiled to herself and lifted up the hem of her skirt with one hand as she stepped over a puddle and climbed into the car.  
明日香自顾自地笑了笑，一手提起裙摆，跨过水坑，爬上了车。

Author's Notes: erm... I really don't have anything to say. Asuka201, thanks for the translation!  
作者的话：呃……我真的没什么可说的。Asuka201，感谢翻译！

Oh yeah, about Misato's handbag: Let's see... the story of that anime involves a Corsican girl, a Japanese girl, and a mysterious group known as the "Soldats"...  
哦对了，关于美里小姐的手提包：让我想想……那个动漫的故事涉及一个科西嘉女孩、一个日本女孩，以及一个神秘的组织，名为“Soldats”……

### Chapter 20: Friday
On Friday, it turned out that Shinji hadn't the vaguest clue where to go.  
到了星期五，事实证明，真嗣对去哪里毫无头绪。

Asuka found him at the breakfast table wearing a frown and studying a travel guide labeled simply "California", which she found odd, considering that he lived there. He'd finished breakfast: several orange seeds remained on the sticky plate in front of him.  
明日香在早餐桌旁找到了他，他正皱着眉头研究一本标着“加利福尼亚”的旅游指南，这让她觉得奇怪，毕竟他就住在那里。他已经吃完了早餐：几颗橙子籽还粘在他面前的盘子上。

"Hey." His face broke into a smile when he noticed her, and he was quick to lay down the magazine. "Do you want me to make you something?"  
“嘿。”他注意到她时，脸上绽放出笑容，并迅速放下杂志。“你想让我给你做点什么吗？”

"No, that's fine." She sat down and helped herself to the platter of fruit.  
“不用了，没事。”她坐下来，自己动手从水果盘里拿了些水果。

"How would you like to go strawberry picking?"  
"你想去摘草莓吗？"

"Strawberry picking?" "摘草莓？"

"Well, it sounds more interesting than 'Garlic Capital of the World'..."  
"嗯，听起来比‘世界大蒜之都’有趣多了……"

Shinji turned the page. 真嗣翻了一页。

"Or we can go visit the Barbie Doll Hall of Fame... no wait, that's closed...what about the jelly bean factory? That should be interesting."  
“或者我们可以去参观芭比娃娃名人堂……等等，那已经关闭了……那果冻豆工厂怎么样？那应该挺有趣的。”

"Okay." Asuka knew what jelly beans were. Akamatsu-san purchased them directly from the manufacturer in Tokyo-3, and she and Madoka would sometimes sprinkle a couple loosely on a scoop of ice cream according to the customer's request. Asuka loved to pick among the colors and make them match the shade of ice cream.  
“好的。” 明日香知道果冻豆是什么。赤松先生直接从第三新东京的制造商那里购买，她和真希波有时会根据顾客的要求，在冰淇淋上撒上几颗松散的果冻豆。明日香喜欢在颜色中挑选，让它们与冰淇淋的颜色相匹配。

"Do you still want to go strawberry picking? We could do that first and then go see the jelly bean factory."  
"你还想去摘草莓吗？我们可以先去摘草莓，然后再去参观软糖工厂。"

"That's fine." "那挺好的。"

Asuka bit into a slice of apple and crunched it satisfactorily. Shinji leafed through the book some more, then left it on the table. He left the room and reappeared a little while later with his laptop.  
明日香咬了一口苹果，满意地嚼着。真嗣又翻了翻书，然后把它放在桌上。他离开房间，过了一会儿带着笔记本电脑回来了。

"Kensuke emailed me those pictures he took of you that first day at work," he said, not making eye contact with her as he clicked and typed. Asuka choked on her piece of apple. "Look."  
"健介把你第一天上班时拍的照片通过邮件发给我了，"他说着，没有看她，只是点击着键盘。明日香被苹果块呛到了。"看。"

He whirled the laptop around.  
他把笔记本电脑转了过来。

"Oh_, no_..." "哦，不..."

She hadn't remembered Kensuke taking that many pictures, but there were twenty-three in all, all shot in a short period of time so that they looked like still frames of a motion picture. The first one showed Asuka smiling, and the next changed to an expression of shock; in later pictures she was ducking behind Shinji with only an arm visible and finally, only Shinji's amused grin.  
她不记得健介拍了那么多照片，但总共二十三张，都是在短时间内拍摄的，看起来像是电影的静止帧。第一张显示明日香微笑，下一张变成了震惊的表情；后来的照片中，她躲在真嗣身后，只露出一只手臂，最后只剩下真嗣的得意笑容。

Asuka blushed and closed her eyes. "I hope no one ever sees them..."  
明日香脸红了，闭上了眼睛。"我希望没人看到它们..."

"Hm... maybe I should email them to Misato?"  
"嗯...也许我应该把它们发给美里？""

Her eyes popped open and he threw up his hands in mock defense. "Just kidding... when do you want to leave to go strawberry picking?"  
她眼睛猛地睁开，他举起双手作势防御。“开个玩笑……你想什么时候出发去摘草莓？”

"Now would be fine." “现在就挺好。”

"All right. Do you want to go ahead and get in the car? I'll clean up here–and the keys are on the counter."  
“好的。你要不先上车？我在这里收拾一下——钥匙在柜台上。”

Asuka took his keys and went outside, enjoying the sunshine. It was relatively cool due to the rainstorm. She pointed the mechanism at the car and pressed the little button. The car greeted her with a beep and a flashing of its lights. Asuka got in and sat down.  
明日香拿着钥匙走到外面，享受着阳光。由于刚下过雨，天气相对凉爽。她将遥控器对准汽车，按下小按钮。汽车用一声哔哔和灯光闪烁回应了她。明日香上了车，坐了下来。

It smelled—like Shinji. She touched the seams of the leather seats, thinking wistfully that she would have to leave soon. Shinji strode out, interrupting her reveries, and shut the garage door.  
车内弥漫着——像是真嗣的味道。她轻触皮座椅的接缝，怅然若失地想着自己很快就要离开。真嗣大步走出，打断了她的沉思，并关上了车库门。

"You should've worn your strawberry dress." He started the engine.  
“你应该穿上你的草莓裙。”他启动了引擎。

"But I wore that yesterday."  
“但我昨天已经穿过了。”

They traveled on several large highways, then smaller, local roads—and finally through a dusty unpaved road. Several miles down, Asuka spotted a handwritten sign that read "Strawberries" with an arrow pointing straight ahead.  
他们先是驶过几条宽阔的高速公路，接着是较小的乡村道路——最后穿过了一条尘土飞扬的未铺砌道路。行驶了几英里后，明日香看到了一个手写的牌子，上面写着“草莓”，并有一个箭头直指前方。

A mile later, nothing that vaguely resembled a strawberry had appeared.  
又过了一英里，没有任何类似草莓的东西出现。

Shinji was agitated. He was sure the road hadn't forked anywhere, and he was certainly still driving on the dusty old road. Could that sign possibly have been left over from years past? Then again, the magazine he had been reading was quite recent, issued only last month, and he had followed its instructions down to the letter...  
真嗣感到不安。他确信这条路并没有分岔，而他无疑仍在那条尘土飞扬的老路上行驶。那个标志可能是多年前遗留下来的吗？不过，他一直在阅读的那本杂志非常新，上个月才发行，而他严格按照杂志上的指示行事...

"There!" “那里！”

Shinji's head jerked upwards. "What? Where?"  
真嗣的头猛地抬起。“什么？哪里？”

"_There!_" “那里！”

= = = = = = =

"There; you may go anywhere over the fields and pick as many strawberries as you like, and return here to pay when you are finished."  
“那里；你可以随意在田野上走动，摘取你喜欢的草莓，摘完后再回到这里付款。”

Asuka was in front, carrying a cardboard tray in which she began to stack ripe strawberries. It was a skill, she thought, to be able to find the perfect strawberry. She had just a bit of experience selecting strawberries—they had to be perfectly ripe, since strawberries did not ripen once they were picked. They had to be bright red and firm, with no bruises. She loved perfectly-shaped strawberries. Asuka brushed aside a leaf, found the perfect strawberry, and plucked it.  
明日香走在前面，手里拿着一个纸板托盘，开始堆放成熟的草莓。她认为，找到完美的草莓是一种技巧。她在挑选草莓方面只有一点经验——它们必须完全成熟，因为草莓一旦被摘下就不会再熟了。它们得鲜红且结实，没有瘀伤。她喜欢形状完美的草莓。明日香拨开一片叶子，找到了一颗完美的草莓，并将其摘下。

"How do you keep having such good luck?" Shinji came over, wearing a pout. He had picked a total of five strawberries, two of which were bruised and leaking juice all over the others.  
“你怎么总是这么好运？”真嗣走过来，噘着嘴。他总共摘了五颗草莓，其中两颗已经碰伤，汁水流得到处都是。

Asuka slapped at a pesky mosquito. She found a perfect strawberry and held it up in her hand. "Look, Shinji... to be perfectly ripe, it should be bright red, no bruises, no holes from insects..."  
明日香拍打着一只讨厌的蚊子。她找到了一颗完美的草莓，举在手中。“看，真嗣……要完全成熟，它应该是鲜红色的，没有碰伤，也没有虫子咬的洞……”

Shinji looked red-facedly at his meager harvest.  
真嗣红着脸看着自己那少得可怜的收获。

"Okay, let's start over," he said cheerfully, tossing the bruised ones over his shoulder, not bothering to see where they landed. Asuka noticed, however.  
"好了，我们重新开始，" 他愉快地说道，将那些碰伤的苹果抛向身后，懒得去看它们落在哪里。明日香注意到了这一点。

"Mommy! Something just hit me in the back! Oww! It hit me again!"  
"妈妈！有什么东西打中我的背了！哎哟！又打中我了！"

"Let me see, Kevin..." "让我看看，凯文..."

"It's wet!" The little boy ran over to his mother, twisting his neck and pulling his shirt around in an attempt to see what had hit him. "Eww! Mommy!"  
"好湿啊！" 小男孩跑到妈妈身边，扭着脖子，试图扯起衣服看看是什么东西打中了他。"哎呀！妈妈！"

The mother shifted the baby to her other hip and crooned softly to the one in her stroller. "Let me see..."  
母亲将婴儿换到另一边的髋部，对推车里的孩子轻声哼唱。"让我看看..."

There were two purple-red splotches on the back of his shirt.  
他的衬衫背面有两块紫红色的污渍。

"Kevin!" She straightened up as best as she could, for the baby was wailing and kicking. "You've ruined another good shirt! That's the last white one you have!"  
“凯文！”她尽可能挺直身子，因为宝宝正在哭闹踢腿。“你又毁了一件好衬衫！那是你最后一件白色的了！”

"But Mommy..." “但是妈妈……”

"I don't want to hear any buts, Kevin. _You have to be careful!_ What did I tell you on the way? _Strawberry juice doesn't wash out!_" She patted the girl on the head and set her on the floor, where she toddled a few steps before falling. Kevin rolled his eyes and turned back to picking strawberries, the mishap forgotten. Dirty clothes were not an issue to him, regardless of how much they might irritate his mother. He moved back a step—and stepped on his sister's foot. The child let out a cry.  
“我不想听任何借口，凯文。你得小心点！我路上怎么跟你说的？草莓汁是洗不掉的！”她轻拍了一下女孩的头，把她放在地上，女孩蹒跚了几步就摔倒了。凯文翻了个白眼，转身继续摘草莓，这个小插曲已被他抛诸脑后。脏衣服对他来说不是问题，不管它们可能让母亲多么恼火。他后退了一步——却踩到了妹妹的脚。孩子哭了起来。

"_KEVIN!_" "凯文！"

"I'm sorry!" "对不起！"

A sigh. "Pick up your basket. We're moving to a wider row, where Kara can move around freely. And Julie, _please_ don't throw your pacifier down again... it's getting all dirty."  
一声叹息。“拿起你的篮子。我们要移到更宽的一排，这样卡拉可以自由活动。还有朱莉，请不要再把你的安抚奶嘴扔下来了...它已经弄得很脏了。”

Shinji was hunched over, his face as red as Asuka's strawberries. Asuka, on the other hand, was struggling not to laugh.  
真嗣弯着腰，脸红得像明日香家的草莓。而明日香则努力忍住不笑出声。

"I feel really guilty..."  
“我感到很内疚……”

"He'll get over it." Asuka knew this from experience; the boy reminded her strongly of Makoto. "It's his mother that'll have to suffer, but I'm sure she can handle it." _As could Kimie._ She missed Kimie. "He'll be off and running again in no time."  
“他会挺过去的。”明日香凭经验知道这一点；这个男孩让她强烈地想起了诚。“受苦的是他妈妈，但我相信她能应付。”同样，君子也能。她想念君子。“他很快就会重新振作起来。”

Shinji glanced over his shoulder, barely daring to show his face, but Asuka was right; the boy was running far ahead of his mother, who was pushing the stroller with one hand and carrying her middle child in the other.  
真嗣微微侧过头，几乎不敢露出脸来，但明日香说得没错；男孩远远跑在母亲前面，母亲一手推着婴儿车，另一只手抱着中间的孩子。

Asuka bit into a strawberry. It was sweet and succulent, having just been plucked moments ago. The redhead glanced at the small family in the distance as she licked crimson juice from her lips. The boy was running and jumping around, the baby happily settled in a patch of strawberry plants, and even the mother was relaxed now. They reminded her of the children back in Tokyo-3—Makoto, Keiichi, Kimie, and all the others. Were they here, Makoto would be running to stuff his cheeks full with ripe fruit; Kimie would be calmly filling a basket with perfect fruit, occasionally pulling her youngest brother back within her reach. Keiichi's behavior would be somewhere between the two.  
明日香咬了一口草莓。它甜美多汁，刚刚才摘下来。红发女孩瞥了一眼远处的小家庭，舔去唇边的鲜红果汁。男孩跑来跑去，婴儿在一片草莓丛中开心地躺着，连母亲也放松了下来。这让她想起了在第三新东京市的孩子们——真琴、圭一、君子，还有其他所有人。如果他们在这里，真琴会跑去把脸颊塞满成熟的果实；君子则会平静地往篮子里装满完美的水果，偶尔把最小的弟弟拉回自己身边。圭一则介于两者之间。

She put another red berry into her tray. _If only we could all live together in Japan,_ she thought wistfully. It was something to look forward to, however, seeing the children and Misato again; Asuka knew she had been moping way too much over leaving Shinji. She turned back to her patch.  
她又往托盘里放了一颗红莓。要是我们都能在日本一起生活该多好，她憧憬地想着。不过，能再次见到孩子们和美里，总归是件值得期待的事；明日香知道，自己对离开真嗣这件事太过消沉了。她转回自己的草莓丛。

"Hey!" Shinji called excitedly. "I found a perfect one!"  
“嘿！”真嗣兴奋地喊道，“我找到一个完美的！”

= = = = = = =

It began to soon get uncomfortably hot, and the mosquitoes came in huge swarms. Asuka was tired of the furry sensation that strawberry leaves left on her hand, and Shinji was frustrated at finding insect-infested berries. He paid for their strawberries (three full trays in total), and they set off towards the jelly bean factory. It suddenly occurred to them that strawberries had to be kept chilled. The fruit would not fare well if it were left in the Californian summer heat for several hours.  
很快，天气变得异常炎热，蚊子成群结队地袭来。明日香厌倦了草莓叶在她手上留下的毛茸茸的感觉，而真嗣则因找到虫蛀的浆果而感到沮丧。他为他们的草莓付了款（总共三整盘），然后他们动身前往软糖工厂。他们突然意识到草莓需要冷藏。如果让这些水果在加州的夏日高温下放置几个小时，它们的状态不会太好。

Shinji stopped at the first grocery store he could find and immediately headed to the ice freezer—but then Asuka reminded him that they couldn't simply place the ice bag on top of the strawberries; they needed separate containers. Shinji thought this over and wandered around the store, looking for anything that could hold ice and strawberries and keep the mixture cool for some time. Then he found the section of children's lunchboxes.  
真嗣在找到的第一家杂货店停下，立刻走向冰柜——但明日香提醒他不能直接把冰袋放在草莓上；他们需要分开容器。真嗣思考了一下，在店里四处寻找能同时容纳冰块和草莓并保持低温的东西。然后他发现了儿童午餐盒的区域。

Several people gave them weird looks as they made their way back to the car, carrying four lunch boxes apiece, but it solved the problem. Asuka layered ice in the bottom of each lunchbox and Shinji placed a single layer of strawberries on top. After sandwiching eight lunchboxes of ice and strawberries and placing them in the shade, the two climbed back into their respective seats and continued the drive.  
当他们带着各自的四盒午餐返回汽车时，不少人投来奇怪的目光，但这确实解决了问题。明日香在每个午餐盒底部铺上冰块，而真嗣则在上面放上一层草莓。将八个装满冰块和草莓的午餐盒夹好后，放在阴凉处，两人便各自回到座位，继续驾驶。

= = = = = = =

They were ushered into the factory in groups packed so closely together that Asuka held on to Shinji's arm for fear she would trip over someone. She passed time by alternating standing still and moving forward about ten feet at a time. She had not known that jelly beans were so popular in America.  
他们被引导进入工厂，人群密集到明日香紧抓着真嗣的手臂，生怕自己会绊倒别人。她通过交替站立不动和向前移动约十英尺来打发时间。她没想到在美国，软糖豆会如此受欢迎。

There was an attraction in the very front that kept drawing "ooh"s and "ahh"s from the waiting tourists, but Asuka could not see what it was, even as she stood on tiptoe. When her turn came, she was disappointed at not being able to recognize the man whose portrait had been created out of jelly beans. Shinji identified him as Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States.  
在最前方的景点不断吸引着等待的游客发出“哦”和“啊”的惊叹声，但明日香即使踮起脚尖也看不清是什么。轮到她时，她失望地发现自己认不出那个用软糖豆拼成的肖像画上的人是谁。真嗣告诉她，那是罗纳德·里根，美国第 40 任总统。

"Such a great president," sighed the lady on duty, who was waiting for her turn to take them on tour. She wore a large green apron sprinkled with jelly beans of all different colors. "There's an identical portrait in his hometown of Dixon, Illinois."  
"真是个伟大的总统，"值班的女士叹息道，她正等着轮到她带领他们参观。她穿着一件大绿色围裙，上面洒满了各种颜色的软糖豆。"在他的家乡伊利诺伊州迪克森市，有一幅一模一样的肖像。"

A light overhead flashed green, and the woman got up quickly from the railing she was leaning on. She waved her arms.  
头顶上的灯光闪烁着绿色，女人迅速从她倚靠的栏杆上站起身来。她挥动着手臂。

"All right folks! This way!  
"好了，各位！这边请！"

"It takes seven days to make a jelly bean," she explained, as the group of people boarded a large elevator that took them up to the second floor. She took a microphone off of the elevator wall and continued to speak over the marvels of the tourists, all of whom were plainly much more interested in watching through the glass walls than listening to what she had to say. "Fortunately, they are not made one at a time; in fact, they are made millions at a time. Jelly beans are made mostly out of sugar, although they also contain some water and starch. They have two parts—a center and an outer shell, which contains the flavor—look to your left, that machine is pouring sugar into the mixer—"  
"制作一颗果冻豆需要七天时间，" 她解释道，这时一群人登上了一部大型电梯，将他们带到二楼。她从电梯墙上取下一个麦克风，继续向游客们介绍这些奇迹，而所有人都明显更感兴趣透过玻璃墙观看，而不是听她说话。"幸运的是，它们不是一颗一颗制作的；实际上，它们是数百万颗一起制作的。果冻豆主要由糖制成，尽管它们还含有一些水和淀粉。它们有两个部分——中心和外壳，外壳含有风味——看你的左边，那台机器正在向搅拌机中倒糖——"

"That's an awful lot of sugar," Shinji commented.  
"那可是大量的糖啊，" 真嗣评论道。"

"—after the solution is done, it will be used to fill little jelly bean molds and heated so that all the water evaporates, leaving us with a solid jelly bean center."  
"—溶液完成后，将被用来填充小果冻豆模具并加热，以便所有水分蒸发，留下固态的果冻豆中心。"

The elevator came to a stop and the doors opened. The tour guide led the way out, and Shinji and Asuka followed. They were now on a sort of balcony with a floor of strong wire mesh framed with metal fences to ensure that no one fell into the tanks.  
电梯停了下来，门缓缓打开。导游率先走出，真嗣和明日香紧随其后。他们现在站在一个类似阳台的地方，地面是坚固的金属网，四周用金属栏杆围起，以防有人不慎跌入水池。

"Right this way, please." Her heels clanked on the mesh; she walked quickly, and Shinji and Asuka hurried to keep up. "We are now in a section of the factory where the outer covering is added to the jelly bean centers. If you look down there now, you can see one of our bean-hives, where the dried bean centers are being coated with a mixture of sugar, coloring, and their proper flavor. Yes?"  
“请这边走。”她的高跟鞋在金属网上发出清脆的响声；她步伐迅速，真嗣和明日香急忙跟上。“我们现在位于工厂的一部分，这里是为软糖核心添加外层的地方。如果你们现在往下看，可以看到我们的一个蜂巢式工作区，那里正在用糖、色素和相应口味混合物给干燥的软糖核心上糖衣。明白了吗？”

A little boy in the front had raised his hand. "What kind is being made here?"  
前排的一个小男孩举起了手。“这里做的是什么口味的？”

"Buttered Popcorn; it's one of our most popular flavors."  
"黄油爆米花；这是我们最受欢迎的口味之一。"

She paused to let them admire the art of jelly bean making.  
她停顿了一下，让他们欣赏制作果冻豆的艺术。

"The hive spins them around and ensures that each bean is sufficiently coated with the butter mixture. During this process, pipes are used to suck out the air so that the beans dry and do not stick together. When they dry, they will eventually be mixed with other colors, packaged, and shipped off across America."  
"蜂巢将它们旋转，确保每个豆子都充分裹上黄油混合物。在这个过程中，使用管道吸出空气，使豆子干燥且不会粘在一起。干燥后，它们最终会与其他颜色混合，包装并运往美国各地。"

Shinji and Asuka followed everyone else back down to the lobby, where they were given free samples. Asuka didn't care for the taste of jelly beans and handed her package to Shinji, who ate his way through half the bag before choking on a jalapeno flavored bean.  
真嗣和明日香跟着其他人回到了大厅，那里他们得到了免费试吃的样品。明日香不喜欢吃软糖的味道，把她的那份递给了真嗣，真嗣吃掉了半袋后，被一颗墨西哥辣椒味的软糖呛到了。

"We need to go soon," Asuka pointed out, recalling the strawberries in their back trunk. "We've still got—Shinji? Hey, Shinji?"  
“我们得快点走了，”明日香提醒道，想起了后备箱里的草莓。“我们还有——真嗣？嘿，真嗣？”

Shinji was bent over a trashcan, spitting out every last trace of the jalapeno jelly bean.  
真嗣正弯腰对着垃圾桶，吐出了每一丝墨西哥辣椒软糖的痕迹。

= = = = = = =

"Are you sure you don't want any?"  
"你确定不要一些吗？"

"I'm sure." “我确定。”

Shinji popped another bean into his mouth. The second package was now open and sitting in a little crevice under his radio, and his hand kept straying to it.  
真嗣又往嘴里塞了一颗豆子。第二包现在已经打开，放在他收音机下面的小缝隙里，他的手不停地伸向那里。

Asuka jumped suddenly, and Shinji swerved. "Oh! I should have saved some to bring back to the children!"  
明日香突然跳了起来，真嗣也跟着晃了一下。"哦！我应该留一些带回去给孩子们的！"

"You can have the rest," Shinji offered, twisting up the top of the bag. Asuka shook her head. "Or we can always purchase a bag at the store that looks exactly the same. You can tell them how jelly beans are made, and only you and I will know that I ate all of our original jelly beans."  
"剩下的你拿去吧，" 真嗣说着，扭紧了袋口。明日香摇了摇头。"或者我们可以在店里买个一模一样的袋子。你可以告诉他们软糖豆是怎么做的，只有你和我才知道我把我们原来的软糖豆全吃光了。"

"All right. One bag might not be enough though..." She trailed off, thinking about the boys.  
"好吧。不过一袋可能不够..." 她顿了顿，想着那几个男孩。

"You can buy as many as you want." Shinji plucked another one from the bag. Asuka laughed at him—he'd been eating all the way home—and snatched the bag away playfully.  
"你想买多少就买多少。" 真嗣又从袋子里拿了一颗。明日香笑着看他——他一路上一直在吃——然后开玩笑地抢走了袋子。

Shinji pouted. 真嗣撅起了嘴。

Author's Notes: To tell the truth, I haven't been to California in more than nine years (and I was six years old then) so I really don't know much about it. Nor do I know anything about jelly bean making, so I did a bit of research on that; my apologizes for any errors I've made (several parts came directly from my imagination). In case anyone is interested, there really is a jelly bean factory in Fairfield, California!  
作者笔记：说实话，我已经有九年多没去过加州了（那时我才六岁），所以对那里真的不太了解。对于制作软糖豆的知识我也一无所知，所以在这方面做了些研究；对于可能出现的错误，我深表歉意（有几个部分完全来自我的想象）。如果有谁感兴趣的话，加州费尔菲尔德确实有一家软糖豆工厂！

I'm really sorry for having the story drag on for so long; I promise it's almost over!  
真的很抱歉让故事拖了这么久；我保证它就快结束了！

And yes, Misato's handbag belongs to Mireille Bouquet, the Corsican blonde of Noir. (I don't own any part of that, either). Congratulations to selti and Amethyst Wind!  
没错，美里（Misato）的手提包属于《黑街二人组》（Noir）中的科西嘉金发女郎米雷耶·布凯（Mireille Bouquet）。（我同样不拥有该作品的任何部分）。祝贺 selti 和 Amethyst Wind！

### Chapter 21: Saturday
Kimie was an early bird, as her brothers liked to call her; she rose daily with the sun. She didn't generally have much choice—the boys liked to sleep in a bit, and they liked to eat before doing anything else in the morning. In addition, her little rooms were always in need of sweeping and dusting—Kimie liked to have things perfectly neat.  
纪美是个早起的人，正如她的兄弟们喜欢称呼她的那样；她每天随着太阳一同起床。她通常没有太多选择——男孩们喜欢多睡一会儿，而且他们喜欢在早上做其他事情之前先吃东西。此外，她的小房间总是需要打扫和除尘——纪美喜欢一切都井井有条。

But last night Keiichi had come up with the idea to go exploring, and after much cautioning from their older sister, he and his younger brother—and a crony of friends—had set out. Kimie busied herself scrubbing the floor and cooking up a large meal for the boys. Things, however, didn't work out quite as she had liked—Keiichi had apparently thought it funny to place a large spider on Makoto's arm; Makoto saw it, panicked, and ran screaming home. On the way he tripped over a branch and cut his knee severely on some thorny bushes. Kimie had to go find them; dinner was put on hold, and it was very late before everyone returned to his or her respective beds. She slept late the next morning, and her brothers had followed suit.  
但昨晚圭一突发奇想，要去探险，尽管姐姐再三叮嘱，他还是带着弟弟——以及一群狐朋狗友——出发了。君子忙着擦地板，为男孩们准备了一大桌饭菜。然而，事情并没有如她所愿——圭一显然觉得在真琴手臂上放一只大蜘蛛很有趣；真琴看到后惊慌失措，尖叫着跑回家。途中他被一根树枝绊倒，膝盖在荆棘丛中严重划伤。君子不得不去找他们；晚餐被推迟了，直到很晚大家才各自回到床上。第二天早上她睡得很晚，弟弟们也跟着睡懒觉。

A loud crash woke her several hours after sunrise, and she looked at her clock. It was 9:38 AM. Kimie leapt out of bed, threw on some clothes, and ran to the kitchen, her heart pounding.  
日出几小时后，一声巨响将她惊醒，她看了看时钟。已经是上午 9 点 38 分。君子跳下床，迅速穿上衣服，冲向厨房，心跳加速。

All was silent, untouched. No one had broken into her house. Kimie stood against the wall, not daring to move, and listened.  
一切静悄悄的，完好无损。没有人闯入她的家。君子靠在墙上，不敢动弹，仔细聆听。

"Ah, damn you..." “啊，该死的……”

It was a female voice. Kimie blinked. She crept to the window and peeked out.  
那是一个女性的声音。君子眨了眨眼，悄悄地靠近窗户，向外窥视。

Misato was furiously kicking her car, which was tipping precariously off the road. Apparently the engine had died, for Misato gave up kicking, went to the back, and began pushing with all the force she could muster while pelting it with every random curse she knew.  
美里正愤怒地踢着她的车，车子摇摇欲坠地偏离了道路。显然是引擎熄火了，美里放弃了踢打，走到车后，开始用尽全力推车，同时嘴里不停地咒骂着她所知道的所有脏话。

Kimie ran outside to help.  
希美跑出去帮忙。

"Asuka-san's coming home tomorrow, isn't she?" she asked, as they planted their feet behind the vehicle and pushed.  
“明日香小姐明天回家，对吧？”她问道，两人将脚抵在车后，一起用力推。

"Mmm—yes," Misato ground out. "That's why I came back from Kyoto. I have to go pick her up tomorrow night." She kicked the car again. "Move!"  
“嗯——是的，”美里咬牙说道，“所以我从京都赶回来了。明天晚上我得去接她。”她又踢了车子一脚，“用力推！”

"Makoto's all excited about seeing Asuka-san again," Kimie remarked, almost to herself. "He's got so many adventures to tell her about...and he wants to hear all about your time in Kyoto, Misato-san."  
"真琴对再次见到明日香小姐感到非常兴奋，" 君惠低声自语道，"他有许多冒险故事要告诉她...他还想听听你在京都的经历，美里小姐。"

They pushed for awhile longer with little effect before Misato gave up.  
他们又努力了一会儿，但效果甚微，美里最终放弃了。

"Thanks for your help anyway," she said, smoothing out her skirt. "You'll bring the children over tomorrow night to celebrate?"  
"无论如何还是谢谢你的帮助，" 她一边说，一边整理着裙子，"明晚你会带孩子们过来庆祝吗？"

"Yes, I will," she promised.  
“是的，我会。”她承诺道。

= = = = = = =

Both brothers were awake when she got home, and complaining loudly of their hunger. Makoto's knee was still swathed in a thick makeshift bandage; she would have to change that later. Kimie focused on cooking and ordered the two to sit at opposite ends of the table to avoid fighting.  
她回到家时，两兄弟都醒着，大声抱怨着饥饿。诚的膝盖仍裹着厚厚的临时绷带；她稍后得换掉那个。君子专注于做饭，并命令两人坐在桌子的两端，以免打架。

Things had been like this for several years, since Makoto was a toddler. Kimie had rocked and sung him to sleep; she had taught him how to read and scolded Keiichi for teasing him. Keiichi had always been the independent one; even before they had lived alone, he'd always taken care of himself. The one thing he couldn't do was cook—that was his older sister's duty. He'd proven himself quite capable of doing the laundry and washing dishes—he just managed to avoid doing it on most occasions.  
这种情况已经持续了好几年，自从诚还是个幼儿时就开始了。君子曾摇着他唱歌哄他入睡；她教他如何阅读，并责备圭一戏弄他。圭一一直是独立的那一个；即使在他们独自生活之前，他总是自己照顾自己。他唯一不会做的事就是烹饪——那是他姐姐的责任。他证明了自己在洗衣服和洗碗方面相当能干——只是大多数时候都设法避免了这些家务。

Kimie sliced bread and brought over three steaming bowls of miso soup. There was rice leftover from last night's dinner, so she warmed that as well.  
纪美切着面包，端来了三碗热气腾腾的味噌汤。昨晚晚餐剩下的米饭，她也一并加热了。

"Misato-san's back," Kimie commented, "and Asuka-san is coming home tomorrow."  
“美里小姐回来了，”纪美说道，“明日香明天也要回家了。”

"I want to tell her all about the rocks I found!" Makoto shouted.  
“我想告诉她我找到的那些石头！”真琴兴奋地喊道。

"She doesn't care about your rocks, _baka_," Keiichi scoffed. He sipped his soup leisurely while Makoto turned a bright red.  
"她才不在乎你的石头呢，笨蛋，" 濑以为嘲讽地说。他悠闲地啜饮着汤，而真琴的脸涨得通红。

"She does too!" "她就是喜欢！"

"Does not!" "才不喜欢！"

"Does too!" "就是有！"

"I wonder if—"Kimie cut in loudly, attempting to break the tirade of "does- not" "does-too"s, but Makoto pounded his fist, and it landed in his bowl of miso soup. The hot liquid splashed out and soaked him.  
"我想知道是否——"Kimie 大声打断，试图阻止这场"没有" "就是有"的争吵，但 Makoto 一拳砸下，正好落在他的味噌汤碗里。滚烫的汤汁溅了出来，浸湿了他全身。

Keiichi burst out laughing and ducked under the table. Kimie ran to get clean clothes for Makoto, thinking wearily that she had even more washing to do.  
Keiichi 忍不住大笑起来，躲到了桌子底下。Kimie 跑去给 Makoto 拿干净衣服，疲惫地想着她又多了些衣服要洗。

Twenty minutes later they were (somewhat) fed and dressed in clean clothes. A large group of boisterous children came and took Makoto and Keiichi off, shouting to Kimie that they were going to Misato's for watermelon. Would she care to join them?  
二十分钟后，他们（勉强）吃饱了，换上了干净的衣服。一群喧闹的孩子跑来，把真琴和圭一拉走，向君子喊道他们要去美里家吃西瓜。她要不要一起去？

"No, thank you, I have a lot of work to do today," she called back.  
“不了，谢谢，我今天有很多工作要做。”她回喊道。

Kimie hated to waste food. She poured whatever was left in Makoto and Keiichi's bowls into her own, thinking that she would make a bit more rice and perhaps some vegetables for lunch. The rest of the plates she stacked in the sink—her first responsibility was to mop up the soup on and under Makoto's chair. Thank goodness the floor was tiled, and not carpet; it made things much easier to clean.  
君子讨厌浪费食物。她把真琴和圭一碗里剩下的东西倒进自己的碗里，想着再煮一点米饭，或许再炒些蔬菜当午餐。剩下的盘子她堆在水槽里——她的首要任务是擦干净真琴椅子上和下面的汤。谢天谢地，地板是瓷砖的，不是地毯；这样清洁起来容易多了。

She washed the morning's plates and without bothering to turn off the water, threw Makoto's clothes in and began to scrub. Her kitchen window was open and she could hear birds chirping outside. Perhaps her robin would come back today. After she finished the washing she would go outside to mend the pants Makoto had torn yesterday. The day looked very promising.  
她洗着早晨用过的盘子，没有关水，就把真琴的衣服扔进去开始擦洗。厨房的窗户开着，她能听到外面鸟儿的鸣叫。也许她的知更鸟今天会回来。洗完衣服后，她打算出去修补昨天真琴撕破的裤子。这一天看起来充满了希望。

Kimie loved trees, and she had brought many a tiny sprout to her dwelling and coaxed it to grow. There was a slender maple tree growing by her door, just three years old, and a tall weeping willow off in the distance, where the boys loved to romp around and hold challenges to see who could climb the highest.  
君子喜爱树木，她曾带回许多小树苗到她的住处，悉心培育它们成长。门前有一棵纤细的枫树，才三岁大，远处还有一棵高大的垂柳，男孩们喜欢在那里嬉戏，举行比赛看谁能爬得最高。

On the other side of her house, where she hung laundry to dry, Kimie had planted a small juniper bush and frequently used the berries to make a strong solution which supposedly helped to alleviate the effects of bug bites. She had personally never found it useful, but Makoto liked it. She preferred aloe, which also served to cool burns (and Makoto had suffered plenty of those). That she grew on her kitchen windowsill, among many others. Keiichi had recently fallen backwards and wound up sitting on top of Kimie's prized young oak tree. The slender tree trunk, barely thicker than Kimie's finger, had promptly split in half. Kimie had replanted the top half in a small pot on her kitchen windowsill, where it was now flourishing. Kimie grew catnip for curing upset stomachs, rosemary for headaches, and meadowsweet for lowering fevers. Lavender she raised simply because it smelled good.  
在她家另一侧，晾晒衣物的地方，纪惠种了一小丛刺柏，常取其浆果制成浓液，据称能缓解虫咬之痛。她本人从未觉得有用，但诚喜欢。她更偏爱芦荟，同样能舒缓烧伤（诚可没少受这罪）。她将芦荟种在厨房窗台上，还有许多其他植物。圭一最近不慎后仰，一屁股坐上了纪惠珍爱的幼小橡树。那纤细的树干，粗细不过纪惠手指般，随即裂成两半。纪惠将上半截重新栽入厨房窗台上的小花盆，如今已生机勃勃。纪惠种植猫薄荷治胃痛，迷迭香治头痛，绣线菊降热。薰衣草则纯粹因其香气宜人而栽培。

She had grown to dislike the doctors in Tokyo-3; most refused to treat her brothers since she wasn't an adult and didn't have proper papers, or asked questions she didn't want to answer. Over the years she had gradually learned the uses of each forest plant, both by experimenting and reading books she borrowed from the library (one of the few public places she enjoyed). Kimie had learned to recognize them and slowly coaxed each one to grow in her kitchen.  
她对东京-3 的医生们逐渐产生了反感；大多数医生因为她不是成年人且没有正式文件而拒绝治疗她的兄弟们，或者问一些她不想回答的问题。多年来，她逐渐学会了每种森林植物的用途，既通过实验也通过从图书馆借来的书（她喜欢的少数公共场所之一）。纪美子学会了识别它们，并慢慢地引导每一种植物在她的厨房里生长。

She finished the washing and watered each houseplant in turn.  
她洗完了衣服，依次给每盆室内植物浇水。

Kimie stacked the wet laundry in a large bucket and tucked Makoto's pants into her pocket. Her clothes were always sun-dried, and she ensured that by spreading them out across her sloped roof on a sunny day.  
纪美子把湿衣服叠放在一个大桶里，并将诚的裤子塞进口袋。她的衣服总是晒干的，她确保在晴天时把它们铺开在倾斜的屋顶上。

When this task was completed, Kimie chose a shady spot under the willow tree and pulled out Makoto's pants. The tear was fortunately not big and would not take her long to mend. She threaded a needle and wondered what her brothers were up to.  
任务完成后，君子选了柳树下的一处阴凉地，拿出真琴的裤子。幸好裂口不大，缝补起来不会花太多时间。她穿好针线，心里琢磨着兄弟们此刻在忙些什么。

= = = = = = =

"So tell us about Kyoto, Misato-san!"  
“那跟我们说说京都的事吧，Misato-san！”

"Yeah! What did you do there?"  
“是啊！你在那儿都做了些什么？”

"Did you have fun?" "玩得开心吗？"

Misato thought of her jail visit and sweatdropped.  
美里想起她的监狱探访经历，不禁汗颜。

"I went shopping once," she said at last. "Mostly I stayed at home, since I mainly went to visit Ritsuko-san. I cooked and cleaned for her."  
"我曾去购物过一次，"她最后说道，"大部分时间我都待在家里，因为我主要是去看望律子小姐。我为她做饭和打扫。"

"That's the doctor, right?"  
"那就是医生，对吧？"

"Right." Misato sank her knife into a ripe watermelon, and everyone cheered.  
"对。" 美里将刀插入熟透的西瓜，众人欢呼起来。

"Asuka-san's coming home tomorrow!" Makoto announced proudly through a mouthful of watermelon. He spit the seeds out to his left, and Keiichi had to duck his head to avoid being hit.  
"明日香小姐明天要回家了！" 真琴自豪地宣布，嘴里还塞满了西瓜。他将籽吐向左边，圭一不得不低头躲避。

"Watch it, will you," he snapped.  
"小心点，行不行？" 他厉声说道。

"We should make something special for her," one of the girls said shyly, wiping watermelon juice from her lips. She was one of the younger ones who rarely got a say in anything. Misato smiled warmly at her.  
"我们应该为她做点特别的，"其中一个女孩羞涩地说，擦去嘴边的西瓜汁。她是年纪较小的那个，很少有机会发表意见。美里对她温暖地笑了笑。

"What would you like to make, Tamika?"  
"你想做些什么呢，Tamika？"

"A picture frame," someone chipped in.  
“一个相框。”有人插话道。

Thus began their project for Asuka's homecoming. The children gathered together and agreed on the design and materials. Misato cut the frame out of heavy cardboard and thick paper. The boys found pinecones and the girls ran home to bring their pressed-flower collections, and together they glued them on to assemble a lovely frame for Asuka. Makoto donated some of his favorite rocks. Misato found the picture she had taken and sent to Shinji for his magazine, and slipped it in. The children all promised to come tomorrow, so that they could present it to her.  
就这样，他们开始了为明日香归家准备的项目。孩子们聚在一起，商定了设计和材料。美里用厚纸板和厚纸剪出了相框的形状。男孩们找来了松果，女孩们跑回家拿来她们压花收藏，大家一起把它们粘贴上去，组装成一个漂亮的相框送给明日香。真琴贡献了他最喜欢的几块石头。美里找到了她为杂志拍摄并寄给真嗣的照片，将其放入相框中。孩子们都承诺明天会来，以便将这份礼物亲手交给她。

"And Keiichi, Makoto, make sure you bring Kimie," Misato advised.  
“还有圭一，真琴，记得带上君子。”美里叮嘱道。

The sun had moved overhead and passed. Kimie had fallen asleep under the tree, shaded by the branches. She opened her eyes to find that they were level with the grass. Cool, sharp little blades of green had imprinted their shape on her face.  
太阳已经移至头顶并渐渐西沉。纪美子在树荫下睡着了，她睁开眼时，发现自己与草地齐平。清凉、锋利的小片绿草在她脸上留下了印记。

She heard a chirp directly overhead and looked up. The bird cocked his head and looked at her curiously. Kimie smiled, recognizing him by the dark spot on his rust-colored front. Perhaps he had already visited her windowsill and found no one there. Kimie reached into her pocket and sprinkled some corn kernels on the grass. The bird spread his wings, fluttering down. He began to peck animatedly at the corn. Kimie lay motionless, watching. When he was done, he hopped a little closer, then took off without warning.  
她听到头顶传来一声鸟鸣，抬头望去。那只鸟歪着头，好奇地打量着她。纪美子微笑着，认出了它胸前那块锈红色的斑点。或许它已经造访过她的窗台，却发现无人应答。纪美子伸手从口袋里撒出一些玉米粒在草地上。鸟儿展开翅膀，轻盈地降落。它开始活泼地啄食玉米。纪美子静静地躺着，注视着这一切。吃完后，它又跳近了一些，然后突然飞走了。

Kimie sat up reluctantly. She didn't have a watch, and her only clock was in the kitchen. Mentally rebuking herself for falling asleep, she stood up and went inside.  
纪美子不情愿地坐起身来。她没有手表，唯一能看时间的钟在厨房里。她在心里责备自己不该睡着，站起身走进屋内。

It was two in the afternoon. There was no sign that her brothers had returned—the kitchen was neat and clean, and her refrigerator remained organized. They had apparently either eaten lunch at Misato's or someone else's house. Makoto and Keiichi did not like to go long without food.  
时值下午两点。她的兄弟们似乎还未归来——厨房整洁干净，冰箱也井然有序。他们显然要么是在美里家，要么是在别人家吃了午饭。真琴和圭一不喜欢长时间不吃东西。

She drank the leftover miso soup from breakfast and ate some bread, then cleared the counter and took out a bag of flour. Her latest visit to the library had yielded some interesting cookbooks, and there were several recipes she wanted to try. If things worked out well, she'd make another one for Asuka-san's homecoming tomorrow.  
她喝掉了早餐剩下的味噌汤，吃了些面包，然后清理了台面，拿出一袋面粉。最近一次去图书馆带回了一些有趣的烹饪书，有几个食谱她想尝试。如果一切顺利，她打算明天再为明日香前辈的归来做一份。

She had checked out a book on American-style pies. In each picture the pie was perfectly puffed up, the crust cooked to a golden brown, the fruit juice oozing out through the top. Kimie opened the book and took out a rolling pin, frowning. She was going to have to make her own pie shells. Plenty of flour, some salt... a few teaspoons of shortening... She added water in little spoonfuls, just enough so that the ingredients mixed into a soft, flaky dough. Kimie sliced off the ragged edges with a sharp knife and placed it over her pie pan. It was too small. She made some more crust and rolled it out again.  
她借了一本关于美式派的书。每张图片中的派都完美地鼓起，外皮烤成金黄色，果汁从顶部渗出。纪美子打开书，拿出擀面杖，皱起了眉头。她得自己制作派皮。大量面粉，一些盐……几茶匙的猪油……她一点点加水，刚好让原料混合成柔软、易碎的面团。纪美子用锋利的刀切掉参差不齐的边缘，将其铺在派盘上。太小了。她又做了一些面团，再次擀开。

The illustration in the book included beautifully scalloped edges and a criss-crossed top crust. Those designs didn't quite fit her capabilities, however, so she skipped them and made a similar, smaller crust for the bottom.  
书中的插图展示了美丽的扇形边缘和交叉的顶部派皮。然而，这些设计超出了她的能力范围，所以她跳过了这些步骤，为底部制作了一个相似但更小的派皮。

Now for the filling. 现在来做馅料。

Kimie propped herself up on one elbow and flipped through the book. Her crust would do for any pie in the book, but she would have to choose a filling Makoto and Keiichi liked. Perhaps a pear pie would do, although she had never heard of such a thing. There were fresh pears growing on the tree she grew at the back of her house. Kimie donned a pair of worn shoes and ran to the back.  
纪美子用一只胳膊肘撑起身体，翻阅着书本。她的面团足够做书中的任何一种派，但她得选一种真琴和圭一喜欢的馅料。或许梨派可以，尽管她从未听说过这种东西。她家后院那棵她种的树上长着新鲜的梨子。纪美子穿上了一双旧鞋子，跑到后院。

She slowed down as she reached the tree and gave the fruit a squeeze. It was still firm, not fully ripe, but it would do. She plucked it with a firm tug and a bug hopped off, landing on a nearby leaf. Kimie shivered and flicked the bottom of the leaf with her index finger. The bug buzzed off angrily.  
她走到树下时放慢了脚步，轻轻捏了捏果实。它还很硬，没有完全成熟，但可以用。她用力一拉，梨子就摘了下来，一只虫子跳了下来，落在附近的叶子上。纪美子打了个寒颤，用食指弹了弹叶子的底部。虫子愤怒地嗡嗡飞走了。

Sometimes pears tend to be nestled in the depths of the tree, shielded and guarded safely by leaves. Kimie climbed the tree and held herself in place with her strong legs while determining which pears would suit her purpose. She picked nine in all, not knowing how many she would need, but wanting to have enough. Each was crisp and leaked just a bit of juice over her kitchen counter as she sliced and peeled them. She put one in her mouth and savored the cool taste, turning back to the book.  
有时候梨子会藏在树的深处，被树叶安全地遮蔽和守护着。纪美子爬上树，用强壮的双腿稳住自己，同时判断哪些梨子适合她的目的。她一共摘了九个，不知道需要多少，但想要足够多。每个梨子都很脆，当她切片和削皮时，果汁滴在了厨房的台面上。她把一个梨子放进嘴里，品尝着清凉的味道，然后转身回到书本前。

Following its instructions, she mixed sugar and flour, vanilla and other extracts. The result was a translucent gooey liquid that reminded her vaguely of egg whites, except darker and thicker. She dropped in her sliced pears and stirred until each piece was coated sufficiently, then poured it into her pie crust and secured the edges. She certainly didn't want the top crust falling off in the oven. Kimie reread the directions once more to satisfy herself—she liked to be sure that she had done everything correctly—and placed the pie into the hot oven.  
按照指示，她将糖和面粉、香草和其他提取物混合在一起。结果是一种半透明的粘稠液体，让她隐约想起了蛋白，只是颜色更深、质地更浓。她放入切好的梨片，搅拌至每片都充分裹上液体，然后倒入派皮中并封好边缘。她当然不希望顶部的派皮在烤箱中脱落。为了确保自己做得正确，Kimie 再次阅读了一遍说明——她喜欢确保自己一切都做对了——然后将派放入热烤箱中。

Cleaning up was almost enjoyable when she was the only one in the house, and the food wasn't yet ready to eat. She felt it was a good way to save time; hardly anything irked the young girl more than laboring for hours to finish a meal, sitting down to eat it, and then facing the large amount of pots and bowls and dishes that had to be washed. Tonight she would only have to rinse out the three dishes she, Makoto, and Keiichi would eat from. She hoped that some of the pie would be leftover for breakfast.  
当家里只有她一个人时，清理工作几乎变得愉快起来，而且食物还没准备好享用。她觉得这是一种节省时间的好方法；没有什么比辛辛苦苦花几个小时准备一顿饭，坐下来吃，然后面对一大堆需要清洗的锅碗瓢盆更让这位年轻女孩恼火的了。今晚她只需要清洗她和 Makoto、Keiichi 将要使用的三个盘子。她希望早餐时还能剩下一些派。

The door burst open abruptly, followed by "I'M HOME!"  
门突然被猛地推开，紧接着是“我回来了！”

"Something smells good," Keiichi commented, taking off his shoes. Kimie beamed. Makoto ran into the kitchen and opened his grubby hand.  
"什么东西这么香啊," 圭一脱下鞋子说道。君子笑逐颜开。真琴跑进厨房，脏兮兮的手掌摊开。

"Look, look, Kimie! I found another pretty stone!"  
"看，看，君子！我又找到一块漂亮的石头！"

"It's wonderful, Makoto," she complimented him. "By the way, I've finished mending your pants. They're on your bed, so please hang them up before you go to sleep."  
"真棒，真琴," 她夸奖道。"顺便说一下，你的裤子我已经补好了。放在你床上，睡觉前请记得挂起来。"

Makoto waved his fistful of rocks and disappeared.  
真琴挥舞着手中的一把石头，随即消失了。

"I'm sorry Keiichi, can you run out and grab the mail?"  
“对不起，圭一，你能跑出去拿一下邮件吗？”

He nodded, threw on his shoes, and ran back outside, slamming the door. A moment later he returned, waving something expectantly.  
他点点头，穿上鞋子，跑出门外，砰地一声关上门。片刻后他回来了，期待地挥动着某样东西。

"Asuka-san's sent us something!"  
“明日香小姐给我们寄了东西！”

Makoto ran out of his room, pulling on his newly mended pants, and Kimie ran to meet him, ignoring the wet counter. "What does it say? Where is she?"  
真琴冲出房间，匆忙穿上刚修补好的裤子，而君子则跑去迎接他，不顾湿漉漉的柜台。“上面写了什么？她在哪儿？”

Keiichi looked the postcard over and threw it at Kimie. "You read it."  
圭一仔细看了看明信片，然后扔给了君子。“你来读吧。”

"Dear Makoto, Keiichi, and Kimie:  
亲爱的真琴、圭一和君子：

"Two days ago I landed in California, where Shinji-kun lives. His house here is very big and has plants growing everywhere. I have my own room. Some of the windows cover the entire wall! Yesterday we went to SeaWorld, where we saw flamingoes and dolphins. Shinji-kun bought me a stuffed animal dolphin. During the dolphin show, the animals splashed a lot, and poor Shinji-kun was quite soaked!  
两天前我抵达了加利福尼亚，这里住着真治君。他的房子非常大，到处都是植物。我有一个自己的房间，有些窗户占据了整面墙！昨天我们去了海洋世界，看到了火烈鸟和海豚。真治君给我买了一个毛绒海豚。在海豚表演时，动物们溅起了很多水花，可怜的真治君被淋得湿透了！  
"I visited his office today. One of our old friends, whom I knew when I was just older than Kimie, also works here. He was very surprised and showed me lots of pictures. Did you know Shinji-kun has been to Brazil?  
今天我参观了他的办公室。我们的一位老朋友，我认识他时比君子大不了多少，也在这里工作。他非常惊讶，给我看了许多照片。你们知道真治君去过巴西吗？

Love, Asuka." 爱，明日香。

The two brothers crowded around their older sister as she deftly sliced the pie. The crust was browned nicely, as she had hoped, and broke into large flakes at the firm touch of her blade. Makoto got the first slice, the filling spilling out of his piece onto the plate. Keiichi got the next, and finally Kimie cut out another for herself. The hot, sweet scent wafted from the open cut of the pie into the air.  
两兄弟围在姐姐身边，看着她熟练地切开派。外皮烤得恰到好处，正如她所愿，刀锋一触即碎成大片。真琴得到了第一块，馅料从他的那片中溢出，落在盘子上。接下来是圭一，最后喜惠子为自己切了一块。热腾腾的甜香从切开的派中飘散到空气中。

"Hey, can I have another piece?" Keiichi asked bluntly. Kimie stared. She had barely had time to sink her fork into the corner of her piece, and Keiichi was already done.  
“嘿，我能再来一块吗？”圭一直截了当地问。喜惠子瞪大了眼睛。她还没来得及将叉子插进自己那块的角落，圭一已经吃完了。

She sliced him another. Even Makoto had seconds, and then thirds.  
她又给他切了一块。就连真琴也吃了第二块，接着是第三块。

"So what did you boys do at Misato's today?" Kimie asked between bites. "You didn't come home for lunch, so I figured you must've been pretty busy."  
“那你们今天在美里那儿都做了些什么？”君子边吃边问，“你们没回家吃午饭，我想你们一定很忙。”

"We made a pretty picture frame for Asuka-san," Makoto said.  
“我们给明日香-桑做了一个很漂亮的相框，”真琴说。

Keiichi added, "Misato put in a picture that she took of Asuka-san several months ago."  
Keiichi 补充道：“Misato 放了一张她几个月前拍的 Asuka 的照片。”

Kimie smiled. She was only half listening; the other half of her mind was busy thinking of the pie she would make tomorrow. Should the filling be of peaches, bananas, or wild raspberries? Or perhaps a traditional, old-style apple pie would do. Whatever she chose, there was one fruit to avoid... and that was the thick-skinned, frosty red watermelons, which grew in the hundreds in Misato's backyard...  
Kimie 微笑着。她只听了一半；另一半心思正忙着琢磨明天要做的派。馅料该用桃子、香蕉还是野生树莓呢？或者干脆做个传统的旧式苹果派。无论她选什么，有一种水果是要避免的……那就是长在 Misato 后院成百上千的厚皮冰镇红西瓜……

Author's notes: Lots to say this time (compared to the last two) For one, I leave tomorrow morning at 9 for Japan, so unfortunately it looks like I won't be finishing this fic before I go. I am going to try and write the last chapter and epilogue out by hand, type it up, and post it when I reach Shinji and Misato's homeland (I guess Asuka is more German...)  
作者笔记：这次有很多要说的（相比前两次）。首先，我明天早上 9 点就要去日本了，所以看起来我没法在出发前完成这篇同人。我会尝试手写最后一章和后记，打字上传，等到了 Shinji 和 Misato 的故乡再发布（Asuka 应该是德国人……）

And I miss my girl Kimie, so I've decided to dedicate a chapter to her. You can decide how Asuka and Shinji spent their last day together in California (no bad things—please keep the rating of this fic in mind!)  
我非常想念我的女孩希美，所以我决定为她写一章。你可以决定明日香和真嗣在加州的最后一天是如何度过的（不要有不好的事情——请记住这篇同人文的评级！）

Also, when Keiichi and Makoto address Kimie, it would seem more likely for them to use "oneesan" (big sister) but I didn't want to disrupt the flow of English with a random Japanese word, so I've simply replaced it with "Kimie".  
另外，当圭一和真琴称呼希美时，他们更可能使用“姐姐”（oneesan），但我不想用一个随机的日语词打乱英语的流畅性，所以我直接用“希美”代替了。

I noted that some reviewers did not agree with the view of the jelly bean tour guide on President Reagan. Please understand that I only added him in because of the actual jelly bean portraits that have been made of him; I'm certainly not qualified to decide whether or not he was a good president, since I wasn't even born when he was president. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with that statement.  
我注意到一些评论者不同意果冻豆导游对里根总统的看法。请理解，我之所以加入他，是因为确实有用果冻豆制作的他的肖像；我当然没有资格评判他是否是一位好总统，因为我甚至在他担任总统时还没出生。如果那句话冒犯了任何人，我深表歉意。

Hmm... I think that's it for now, drop me a review and tell me how I'm doing. Thanks so much to all of you (especially those of you who have stuck with me from the very beginning—Honouza, jennyjennai to name a very few)! I really appreciate your support. Thanks!  
嗯...我想暂时就这样吧，给我留个评论，告诉我做得如何。非常感谢大家（特别是从一开始就陪伴我的那些朋友——Honouza、jennyjennai 等几位）！我真的很感激你们的支持。谢谢！

### Chapter 22: Sunday  

"I'll be there, then," Shinji cut in, clearly exasperated. "Oh, that—I don't care. Anything but the green, since it doesn't go with our cover story. Yes, I'd appreciate that, thank you very much—by the way, is Kensuke there?"  
“那我会去的，”真嗣插话道，显然有些恼火。“哦，那个——我不在乎。只要不是绿色就行，因为它不符合我们的掩护故事。是的，我很感激，非常感谢——顺便问一下，健介在那儿吗？”

He listened intently, absentmindedly shuffling around papers with the other hand. The clock on the wall ticked along cheerfully, never stopping, and soon made another full rotation around its face. The time was 8:38 AM. If his plane left at nine-thirty PM, he would have plenty of time to see Asuka off before hurrying off to catch his own flight.  
他专注地听着，另一只手心不在焉地整理着文件。墙上的时钟欢快地滴答作响，从不停止，很快又完成了一圈的旋转。时间是上午 8 点 38 分。如果他的飞机在晚上九点半起飞，他将有足够的时间为明日香送行，然后再赶去搭乘自己的航班。

"Just a question—why wasn't I informed of this earlier?"  
“只是问一下——为什么我没有早点被告知这件事？”

The reply was not what he wanted to hear, although Shinji didn't think there was anything that he would have accepted as a good response. His secretary, normally very calm and capable regardless of the situation, was becoming flustered under his harsh tone, and Shinji was beginning to feel the first pangs of guilt. It wasn't her fault, after all.  
这个回答并非他所期望的，尽管真嗣不认为有什么能被他接受为好的答复。他的秘书，通常无论情况如何都十分冷静能干，在他的严厉语气下开始显得慌乱，而真嗣也开始感受到一丝愧疚的刺痛。毕竟，这不是她的错。

"I'm sorry, Marta," he sighed. "One last thing—can you find the article about fluorescent sea animals—I forgot what it was called, sorry—and deliver it to Ben? He had a few editorial comments he wanted to make.  
"对不起，玛尔塔，" 他叹息道，"最后一件事——你能找到那篇关于荧光海洋生物的文章吗——我忘了它的标题，抱歉——然后把它交给本？他有些编辑意见想提。

"All right, thank you, Marta—I'll see you Wednesday after next, and if anything comes up then you can either email or call my cell."  
"好的，谢谢你，玛尔塔——下下周三见，如果有什么事，你可以发邮件或打我手机。

In another wing of the house, Asuka stretched. If only the Japanese had such luxurious beds, she thought enviously. Surely three or four people could fit on a bit this big, but it was all hers. It would be hard getting used to a simple cot on the floor again.  
在房子的另一侧，明日香伸了个懒腰。她羡慕地想，要是日本人也有这么豪华的床就好了。这么大的一张床，肯定能睡下三四个人，但这是她一个人的。再次习惯地板上的简易床铺可不容易。

She loved the ceiling fan. It was painted green to match everything else and consisted of five flat panels arranged so that each was an equal distance from any other, giving it the appearance of a very large flower. Asuka had turned it on last night before going to sleep, and all night it had hummed merrily, occasionally adding in a whistle. The blades blended together into one round disk. It was past time to get up.  
她喜欢那台吊扇。它的绿色漆面与周围一切相得益彰，由五个平坦的面板组成，每个面板与其他面板等距排列，使其看起来像一朵巨大的花。昨晚睡觉前，明日香打开了它，整夜它都愉快地嗡嗡作响，偶尔还会吹出一声口哨。扇叶融合成一个圆盘。是时候起床了。

Asuka sat up and folded her hands into fists as she stretched her arms. She lay down again, wanting to savor the flavor of such relaxation; after all, tonight she'd be back to sleeping on Misato's hard floor. The redhead placed herself flat on top of the thick blanket with her back facing up and placed her head on her hands. She closed her eyes.  
明日香坐起身，双手握拳伸展双臂。她再次躺下，想要细细品味这份放松的感觉；毕竟，今晚她又得睡在美里硬邦邦的地板上了。红发少女平躺在厚厚的毯子上，背朝上，头枕在手上。她闭上了眼睛。

Someone knocked on the door. "Asuka?" Shinji called tentatively. "Can I come in?"  
有人敲了敲门。"明日香？"真嗣试探性地喊道，"我能进来吗？"

Asuka leapt up, blushing. "No—no, give me a minute," she called out quickly. "I'm dressing."  
明日香跳了起来，脸颊泛红。“不——不，等我一下，”她急忙喊道，“我在穿衣服。”

"All right." “好的。”

_Quick, must find clothes_, Asuka thought, digging through her suitcase. There would be a lot of repacking to do tonight—but she didn't have time to think of that now—she had to find something proper and clean to wear!  
快，必须找到衣服，明日香想着，翻找着她的行李箱。今晚会有很多东西要重新打包——但她现在没时间考虑这些——她得找到一件得体又干净的衣服穿上！

Her hand touched the blue pleated skirt Misato had bought for her before leaving Japan. In her other hand she seized a white shirt, and hurriedly threw them on.  
她的手触碰到了美里离开日本前为她买的蓝色百褶裙。另一只手则抓起一件白衬衫，匆忙地套在身上。

"Sorry," she apologized, upon coming out.  
“对不起，”她出来时道歉道。

"It's fine," Shinji pointed out, smiling. "But, Asuka... your shirt is inside out."  
“没关系，”真嗣微笑着指出，“不过，明日香……你的衬衫穿反了。”

Asuka looked down and noticed that indeed, all the seams were sticking out.  
明日香低头一看，果然发现所有的缝线都露了出来。

"Excuse me..." “不好意思……”

Ten minutes later she reappeared, properly dressed, teeth and hair brushed, with the latter drawn back into a low ponytail as Hazuki-san had often done for her. Shinji was heating leftovers from last night's dinner and making some fresh rice and vegetables.  
十分钟后，她重新出现，穿戴整齐，牙齿和头发都梳理过了，头发像长良小姐常为她做的那样束成低马尾。真嗣正在加热昨晚的剩菜，并煮了一些新鲜米饭和蔬菜。

"I'm sorry," he apologized. "It looks like I'll be leaving today as well—Kensuke has managed to secure us on a tour of the French countryside—only he didn't get the news until this morning. Since I won't be home for over a week, I need to finish eating all of this or it'll go bad."  
"对不起，"他道歉道。"看来我今天也要走了——健介设法为我们安排了一次法国乡村之旅——只是他今早才得知消息。既然我要离家超过一周，我得把这些都吃完，不然会坏掉。"

Asuka didn't mind at all. In fact, she'd been hoping that there would be some of his noodles left.  
明日香一点也不介意。事实上，她一直希望还能剩下一些他的面条。

"What time will you leave?" she asked, in slightly accented English. Shinji smiled into his coffee as he stirred with a small silver spoon, and it pleased her.  
"你几点出发？"她用略带口音的英语问道。真嗣一边用小银勺搅拌着咖啡，一边微笑，这让她感到高兴。

"After you, so don't worry. I'll drive you to the airport and see you onto the plane before I leave. And I promise I'll mail you a postcard from England."  
"你先走，别担心。我会开车送你去机场，看着你上飞机再离开。我保证会从英国给你寄一张明信片。"

He stirred the coffee some more, and then took a sip. "Where do you want to go today? Other than the grocery store, to buy jelly beans for the children? You'll need to buy some snacks for the flight back, too—I can't imagine how you survived, eating all that airplane food."  
他又搅了搅咖啡，然后喝了一口。“今天你想去哪儿？除了去杂货店给孩子们买果冻豆之外？你还需要为回程的航班买点零食——我真不敢相信你是怎么熬过来的，吃了那么多飞机餐。”

"It wasn't too bad," Asuka admitted. "I want to go down to the lake. I saw some geese there this morning."  
“其实也没那么糟，”明日香承认道，“我想去湖边。今早我在那儿看到了一些鹅。”

"All right. Do you want to go shopping? I should've asked earlier..."  
"好吧。你想去购物吗？我应该早点问的……"

"No, no it's fine," she insisted. "I have everything I could possibly need in Tokyo-3, and I can buy what I want with my salary from the ice cream parlor. I don't have to depend on Misato anymore. It's...a wonderful feeling of freedom," she finished slowly.  
"不，不，没关系，"她坚持道。"我在第三新东京市已经拥有了我可能需要的一切，而且我可以花我在冰淇淋店的工资买我想要的东西。我不再需要依赖美里了。这是一种……美妙的自由感，"她缓缓地说道。

Shinji laughed. "I know how you feel. I had to restrain myself from spending it all when I got my first paycheck."  
真嗣笑了。"我懂你的感觉。我拿到第一份薪水时，差点忍不住全花光了。"

She joined in the laughter, thinking of just how much he must've had to save to buy this house.  
她跟着笑了起来，心里想着他为了买下这栋房子一定存了多少钱。

Shinji drained his coffee in a few more sips, but Asuka took her time with the noodles. She had seen Shinji slice the vegetables and add certain spices. Perhaps she could make it herself at home—and show Misato a thing or two about proper noodles. Asuka grinned wickedly to herself.  
真嗣几口喝完了咖啡，但明日香慢慢地吃着面条。她看到真嗣切了蔬菜并加了些香料。也许她可以在家里自己做——并向美里展示一下什么是真正的面条。明日香邪恶地笑了笑。

"Does Japan allow importing food?"  
“日本允许进口食品吗？”

He shrugged. "As long as you eat it on the flight, it doesn't enter the country. And about the jelly beans, I don't think they'll mind. It'll be packaged, anyway—they're mainly concerned about fresh produce and meat."  
他耸了耸肩。“只要你在飞机上吃掉，它就不会入境。至于那些软糖，我觉得他们不会介意的。反正都会包装好——他们主要关心的是新鲜农产品和肉类。”

Shinji told her a story about his first flight to America. "When we went through customs, they were randomly opening up people's suitcases. This one poor girl had a suitcase full of food—apples, pears, carrots, you name it—even meat—all of it was confiscated, and she was fined heavily. What a terrible experience for one's first day in America."  
真嗣给她讲了他第一次飞往美国的经历。“当我们通过海关时，他们随机打开人们的行李箱。有个可怜的女孩，行李箱里装满了食物——苹果、梨、胡萝卜，应有尽有——甚至还有肉——所有这些都被没收了，她还被重罚了一笔。对一个人来说，第一天到美国就遇到这种事真是糟糕透顶。”

Asuka dropped the bag of jelly beans back onto the shelf. Shinji scoffed and threw it back in their cart. "Japan is much less restrictive on this sort of thing. Don't worry, packaged candy won't hurt you." He picked up the bag himself and studied the package. It was identical to the free samples they had been given two days ago. Shinji gave it some thought, and tossed two more bags into the cart. "For eating on the plane," he admitted guiltily.  
明日香把那袋软糖放回货架上。真嗣嗤之以鼻，又把它扔回他们的购物车里。“日本在这方面限制少得多。别担心，包装好的糖果不会伤害你的。”他自己拿起那袋软糖，仔细研究了一下包装。它和两天前他们收到的免费样品一模一样。真嗣想了想，又往购物车里扔了两袋。“留着在飞机上吃，”他有些内疚地承认道。

He bought a couple of pears for his flight and for Asuka, several apples and five persimmons. Asuka followed him into the aisle of multicultural food and watched in surprise as he plucked three boxes of Mexican rice off of the shelf.  
他为飞行和明日香买了几个梨，还有几个苹果和五个柿子。明日香跟着他走进多元文化食品的过道，惊讶地看着他从货架上拿了三盒墨西哥大米。

"I must say, I've learned to like it after Marta brought it to Kensuke's party," he said. "Did you try some?"  
"我得说，自从玛尔塔把它带到真希波的派对后，我就喜欢上了它，"他说。"你尝过吗？"

"A little, but I didn't like it very much." Asuka remembered Marta. A middle-aged woman with beautiful copper-colored skin who held kindness and quiet capability in her eyes. She had brought the redhead into her small cubicle and shown Asuka pictures of her two grown children. One was in college and the other was a senior in high school. Their pictures plastered her small moveable wall, from babyhood through their teenage years.  
"只尝了一点，但我不是很喜欢。"明日香想起了玛尔塔。一个中年妇女，有着美丽的铜色皮肤，眼中流露出善良和沉静的能力。她把红发的明日香带进她的小隔间，给她看了她两个成年孩子的照片。一个是大学生，另一个是高中高年级的学生。他们的照片贴满了她可移动的小墙，从婴儿时期到青少年时期。

Shinji threw the boxes into the cart. "That should be enough. I don't particularly care for French food."  
真嗣将箱子扔进推车。“应该够了。我对法国菜并不特别感兴趣。”

"Will they let you into France with all that?" Asuka teased.  
“他们会让你们带着这些东西进法国吗？”明日香打趣道。

"I'd rather take the risk of getting caught and being fined. I'm not going anywhere without food!"  
“我宁愿冒着被抓和罚款的风险。没有食物我哪儿也不去！”

Misato was still in a fury over her car.  
美里还在为她的车大发雷霆。

"If there weren't so many children around, I would be cursing so—violently," she growled. Makoto and Keiichi, among others, were racing around her house energetically. Every few moments she cast a glance to make sure no one was hurt, then turned back to complaining about the car.  
“如果不是有这么多孩子在场，我早就破口大骂了——非常粗鲁的那种，”她咆哮道。真琴和圭一等人正在她家周围精力充沛地奔跑。每隔一会儿，她都会瞥一眼，确保没人受伤，然后又转回抱怨车子。

"The problem hasn't gotten better at all, Misato-san?" Kimie asked sadly. She was perched atop a chair in the kitchen, rolling out flour and salt for tonight's pie. A few droplets of water soaked into the dry dough. Kimie flipped it over and gave it a pat. Pie crust!  
“问题一点都没好转吗，美里小姐？”君子难过地问。她坐在厨房的椅子上，正在为今晚的派擀面粉和盐。几滴水渗入了干面团。君子把它翻过来拍了拍。派皮！

"Well, it moves," Misato confessed grudgingly, "very slowly, however, and it is a MAJOR pain in the—"Kimie glanced at her warningly: "...it's very hard to steer."  
"嗯，它能动，"美里不情愿地承认，"不过非常慢，而且是个大麻烦在——"君子警告地看了她一眼："...很难操控。"

Kimie smiled. "Well, that's an improvement."  
君子笑了。"嗯，这是个进步。"

"Not nearly enough," Misato grumbled. "At that rate, I should be setting out—about NOW—in order to get there by the time she walks out of the airport. And her flight's not due to land for another three, no four, hours."  
"还远远不够，"美里嘟囔着。"照这个速度，我应该现在就出发——才能在她走出机场时赶到。而她的航班还要再过三四个小时才降落。"

The two women worked in silence, Kimie on her pie and Misato on the four different dishes she was preparing, not divulging just how much she would like to taste Shinji's cooking again. There was a massive thundering on the stairs.  
两位女士默默地工作着，纪美子在做她的派，而美里则在准备四道不同的菜肴，没有透露她有多么想再次品尝真嗣的厨艺。楼梯上传来了巨大的轰鸣声。

"We're going outside, Misato-san!" the boys called as they ran out the door.  
“我们要出去玩了，美里小姐！”男孩们喊着，跑出了门。

Misato nodded to them and wiped her hands on a towel. "Kimie, you haven't yet told me what's going in your crust. What have you planned?"  
美里向他们点点头，用毛巾擦了擦手。“纪美子，你还没告诉我你的派皮里放了什么。你打算做什么？”

"Well," the girl faltered. "I don't quite know...I made pear for my brothers yesterday, and they loved it, but we all ate so much that I'm not willing to go near my pear tree for a few days."  
"嗯，"女孩犹豫地说。"我不太确定……昨天我给弟弟们做了梨子，他们很喜欢，但我们吃得太多，以至于我这几天都不想靠近我的梨树了。"

Misato laughed. "Whatever filling you choose, don't pick—"  
美里笑了。"无论你选什么馅料，别挑——"

"—watermelon," Kimie finished for her, and both burst into laughter. "I really do have to decide soon, Misato-san, before my crust dries out. What can I put in it? What does Asuka-san like?"  
"——西瓜，"纪美子替她说完，两人都笑了起来。"我真的得快点决定了，美里小姐，不然我的饼皮就要干了。我能放些什么呢？明日香小姐喜欢什么？"

"She eats just about anything I buy," Misato said thoughtfully. "I wonder what I have?" Kimie laid her crust over the pie pan and waited while the purple-haired lady rummaged through her refrigerator. "I have two apples, three peaches, and a string of grapes. There's not enough of any one fruit to make a pie, is there?"  
"她几乎吃我买的任何东西，" 美里若有所思地说道。"我在想我有什么水果呢？" 纪惠将她的饼皮铺在派盘上，等待着紫发的女士翻找她的冰箱。"我有两只苹果，三个桃子，还有一串葡萄。没有一种水果足够多来做个派，对吧？"

"We could put them all in." Kimie was enjoying herself. "A fruit salad pie. Do you have any vanilla extract, Misato, and sour cream?"  
"我们可以把它们都放进去。" 纪惠玩得很开心。"水果沙拉派。美里，你有香草精和酸奶油吗？"

= = = = = = =

"I'm sorry we didn't come here earlier."  
"真遗憾我们没有早点来这里。"

"Me too." “我也是。”

They were sitting on the grassy slopes of Shinji's backyard, which extended into the lake. Shinji had thought to bring bug repellant, and now they were able to enjoy the nature without being bothered by the buzzing insects.  
他们坐在真嗣后院的草坡上，草坡一直延伸到湖边。真嗣想到了带驱虫剂，现在他们可以享受大自然而不被嗡嗡作响的昆虫打扰。

Asuka was sitting back, propping herself up with her hands, but Shinji was lying spread eagled in the grass, not caring that he was getting grass and dirt all over his shirt.  
明日香背靠着地，用手撑着自己，但真嗣却四肢摊开躺在草地上，毫不在意自己的衬衫沾满了草和泥土。

"Will you come back to Japan someday?"  
"你将来会回日本吗？"

"I expect so." Shinji's answer was filled with certainly.  
"我想会的。" 真嗣的回答充满了确定性。

"To stay?" Her voice was barely above a whisper.  
"长住吗？" 她的声音几乎细不可闻。

"I don't know, Asuka." A pair of meadowlarks took off into the air above them and Shinji followed them with his gaze for some time before looking away. "It would be just as hard for me to leave California forever as it would be for you to leave Tokyo-3 forever.  
"“我不知道，明日香。”一对草地鹨从他们头顶飞过，真嗣的目光追随了它们好一会儿才移开。“对我来说，永远离开加州和对你来说永远离开第三新东京市一样艰难。”

"Hey," he grabbed her hand, for she was looking very sorrowful, "please don't be sad, Asuka. I'll write to you, and I'll send you a postcard wherever I go. Think of—of all the children in Japan who are waiting for you to come home and tell them stories. I'll bet none of them have ever traveled as far as you. Think of how happy the jelly beans will make them, and how happy Misato will be when you teach her some new recipes."  
"“嘿，”他抓住她的手，因为她看起来非常悲伤，“请不要难过，明日香。我会给你写信，无论我去哪里都会给你寄明信片。想想——想想日本那些等着你回家给他们讲故事的孩子们。我敢打赌他们中没有一个像你一样走过那么远的路。想想那些糖果会让孩子们多么开心，还有当你教美里一些新食谱时她会有多高兴。”

Asuka smiled then. Shinji looked at his watch. "We have to go."  
"明日香笑了。真嗣看了看手表。“我们得走了。”

Flight 289 from Los Angeles, California, direct flight to Tokyo-3, Japan was on time and scheduled to take off at 7:03 PM. Flight 594 from Los Angeles California, to Paris, France, with a stop in Barcelona, Spain, was late and not scheduled for take off until 10:50. Shinji's expression sank like a stone.  
从加利福尼亚州洛杉矶飞往日本东京-3 的 289 航班准时，计划于晚上 7:03 起飞。从加利福尼亚州洛杉矶飞往法国巴黎，经停西班牙巴塞罗那的 594 航班晚点，计划起飞时间为 10:50。真嗣的表情像石头一样沉了下来。

"I wonder why we're flying to Paris," he mused, rubbing his chin. Paris did not seem like his idea of French countryside. Surely Kensuke or Marta will fix it up. They always have.  
“我想知道我们为什么要飞往巴黎，”他沉思着，揉着下巴。巴黎并不像他想象中的法国乡村。肯斯克或玛尔塔肯定会解决的。他们总是这样。

Asuka followed him to the gate, where there was time for a quick hug before check-in began. She put her arms around him and abruptly broke apart, averting his eyes. Shinji was looking over her baggage. "You've got everything?"  
明日香跟着他来到登机口，在办理登机手续开始前还有时间快速拥抱一下。她张开双臂抱住他，突然分开，避开他的目光。真嗣正在检查她的行李。“你都带齐了吗？”

"Yes, I'm sure," she said.  
"是的，我确定，" 她说。

"Oh, I almost forgot." He reached into his wallet and pulled out a photograph. It was identical to the portrait of himself, Asuka, and Rei hanging in his living room. It was the original. "Keep this."  
"哦，我差点忘了。" 他伸手进钱包，掏出一张照片。这张照片与他客厅里挂着的他和明日香、绫波的肖像一模一样。这是原版。"留着这个。"

Asuka glanced from the young Shinji's face into the twenty-six year old's. "Are you sure?"  
明日香从年轻的真嗣的脸看向二十六岁的他。"你确定吗？"

"I'm sure." “我确定。”

"Thank you." Asuka embraced him one last time and ran towards the flight attendant inspecting tickets. When all she was clear, she waved. Shinji returned the gesture. Asuka hurried into the corridor connecting the plane to the airport.  
“谢谢你。”明日香最后一次拥抱了他，然后跑向正在检查机票的空乘。当她一切准备就绪，她挥了挥手。真嗣也回应了她的手势。明日香匆匆走进连接飞机与机场的走廊。

She was gone. 她离开了。

Shinji blinked, almost daring to hope that she would stick her head out and wave at him again. But she didn't.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，几乎不敢相信她会再次探出头来向他挥手。但她没有。

"So I was driving home from Ritsuko's for most of the night, and this piece of trash decides to die on me when I'm just twenty feet away from my own damn house!"  
“所以我大半夜从律子那里开车回家，结果就在离我家只有二十英尺的地方，这破玩意儿居然给我熄火了！”

Misato was fuming very loudly, so loudly that some nearby drivers pulled down their windows and yelled at her. Then again, perhaps they were demanding that she speed up—they were only moving at eight miles an hour.  
美里气得大声嚷嚷，声音大到附近的一些司机都摇下车窗朝她喊。不过，也许他们是在催她加速——他们的车速只有每小时八英里。

"How's Ritsuko?" Asuka asked timidly.  
“律子怎么样了？”明日香怯生生地问道。

"She's fine, doesn't like her job much, wants to redye her hair since it's fading just a bit," Misato scoffed. "Honestly, if anyone needs their head dyed, it's me, given the amount of white hairs I've had to pull out recently—"  
“她挺好的，不太喜欢她的工作，想重新染发因为颜色有点褪了，”美里嗤之以鼻。“老实说，如果有人需要染发，那应该是我，最近拔掉的那些白头发——”

She ranted on for awhile, then asked, "How's Shinji?"  
她又唠叨了一阵，然后问道：“真嗣怎么样了？”

"He's quite a successful businessman," Asuka commented. "We went out to the party of one of his colleagues, and I found the green dress, Misato. Thank you—you really didn't have to do that."  
"他是个相当成功的商人，" 明日香评论道。"我们去参加了他同事的派对，我在那里找到了那条绿色裙子，美里。谢谢你——你真的没必要这么做。"

Misato smiled sweetly and opened her mouth to say something, but at that moment the car jerked forward. The speedometer's arrow quivered and flipped around until it was pointing at 95. They speeded past the drivers that had earlier thrown insults at them.  
美里甜甜地笑了，正要开口说些什么，但就在这时，车子猛地向前一冲。速度表的指针颤抖着翻转，直到指向了 95。他们迅速超过了之前对他们出言不逊的司机们。

"HAHAHA, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT!" Misato shouted, as they flew through a red light.  
"哈哈哈，这才像样！" 美里大喊着，他们飞驰闯过了一个红灯。

"Misato, please stop!" Asuka screamed over Misato's wild yells. The car lifted off the asphalt for a few seconds, then smashed down on all four wheels. Misato gave the wheel a sharp turn and the car turned 180 degrees around. It was with great relief (for Asuka) that the car finally skidded to a stop some hundred meters down the street from Misato's house.  
“美里，请停下来！”明日香在美里狂野的喊叫声中尖叫道。汽车短暂地离开了柏油路面，然后重重地落在四个轮子上。美里猛地转动方向盘，车子转了 180 度。对明日香来说，车子终于在离美里家几百米远的街道上滑行停下，这让她大大松了一口气。

"Wait, wait," Asuka insisted, as Misato made to back up. "I'm getting out."  
“等等，等等，”明日香坚持道，当美里准备倒车时。“我要下车。”

She ran up to the house alone, but before she made it the doors and windows burst open, and children jumped out of them. Tamika was waving the picture frame, Makoto his rocks, and Kimie came out to top it all with a fresh fruit salad pie. The redhead ran toward them, feeling truly loved. She called out each of their names and swept them into a bear hug.  
她独自跑向房子，但还没到门口，门和窗户就突然爆开，孩子们从里面跳了出来。珠美挥舞着相框，诚拿着他的石头，而君子则端着一盘新鲜水果沙拉派走了出来。红发女孩向他们跑去，感到真正被爱着。她呼唤着每个人的名字，将他们紧紧拥入怀中。

Asuka reached for her bag and remembered it was still in Misato's car. She felt guilty for not having her arms filled with presents for the children, as they had for her, but she would as soon as her bags were unpacked. If they ever got to the front door. Asuka turned to see Misato running into a pothole.  
明日香伸手去拿她的包，这才想起它还在美里车上。她因为没有像孩子们为她准备礼物那样满载礼物而感到内疚，但只要她的行李一打开，她就会立刻补上。如果他们能走到前门的话。明日香转身看到美里跑进了一个坑洞。

And then she heard Shinji's voice echoing in her head over the children's shouts.  
然后她听到真嗣的声音在她脑海中回响，盖过了孩子们的喧闹。

_Think of all the children in Japan who are waiting for you to come home and tell them stories. I'll bet none of them have ever traveled as far as you. Think of how happy the jelly beans will make them.  
想想日本那些等着你回家给他们讲故事的孩子们。我敢打赌，他们中没有一个像你一样走过那么远的路。想想那些果冻豆会让他们多么开心。_

Author's Notes: This is essentially the end of Finding Asuka Langley, but an epilogue will follow (hopefully if I can finish it in the next seven hours, I'm writing on the plane to Tokyo-1, and this will be up when I get there)  
作者的话：这基本上是《寻找惣流·明日香·兰格雷》的结尾，但随后会有一个尾声（希望我能在接下来的七小时内完成，我正在飞往东京-1 的飞机上写作，当我到达那里时，这篇文就会发布）

I've also decided to change the rating to PG... it's sort of been teetering on the edge, especially with all the "damn"s Misato shouted while in jail.  
我也决定将评级改为 PG...它一直徘徊在边缘，尤其是在美里在监狱里大喊“该死”的时候。

I'll have some more formal comments for the epilogue... thanks to all of you!  
尾声部分我会写一些更正式的评论...感谢大家的支持！

### Chapter 23: Epilogue: Finding Rei  
第 23 章：尾声：寻找绫波  

She blinked hard. Crystalline white snowflakes fluttered gracefully from the sky and came to a rest on her eyelashes, giving them an icy, crusted look. This did nothing to improve Asuka's sight, and she wiped them away. They melted on her hand.  
她用力眨了眨眼。晶莹剔透的雪花从天空中轻盈飘落，停歇在她的睫毛上，使其呈现出冰霜覆盖的模样。这并未改善明日香的视线，她拭去雪花，它们在她手上融化。

Shinji came to her side a moment later, as she leaned against the car, folding her arms protectively around herself. Her hair was down around her shoulders, folded loosely into the thick beige winter jacket she wore. Misato had bought it for her as a Christmas gift. She wore neither a hat nor any trace of makeup.  
不一会儿，真嗣来到她身旁，她倚靠在车上，双臂紧紧抱住自己。她的头发披散在肩头，松松地塞进她所穿的厚实米色冬装里。那是美里作为圣诞礼物为她买的。她既没戴帽子，也没有化妆。

"It's gone," she said quietly. Shinji nodded flatly. He had not expected anything less. He had known that the great building that had once housed Nerv would no longer be standing, waiting to welcome them.  
“它不见了。”她轻声说道。真嗣平淡地点了点头。他对此并不意外。他早已知晓，那座曾容纳 NERV 的宏伟建筑，不会再屹立在那里，等待他们的归来。

"Do you want to take a look around?"  
"你想四处看看吗？"

She nodded, and he took the first step away from the car. Asuka followed, her steps making fresh prints in the soft layer of snow on the ground.  
她点点头，他便率先迈步离开汽车。明日香紧随其后，她的脚步在柔软的雪地上留下新鲜的足迹。

Neither had given a thought to the Geofront in over a decade; they could only assume that it had been torn down in the years since Nerv had disbanded. There was nothing left of the calm determination belonging to Misato, nor the quick thinking of Ritsuko. Peace and tranquility had replaced panic and desperation.  
两人已有十多年未曾想起过地底都市，只能猜测自 NERV 解散以来，它已被拆除。米萨托的沉着决心和律子的敏捷思维都已不复存在。宁静和平取代了恐慌与绝望。

A variety of slender saplings had replaced all man-made structures in the vicinity. They were spaced unevenly, suggesting that no one had taken the trouble to plant them properly; perhaps they had sprouted from seeds carried on the wind. Their branches were bare and forlorn now, ghostly figures of the ample summer, cold and dead to the touch. Asuka reached for one and noticed the tiny buds at the tips. Life prevailed.  
各种纤细的树苗取代了附近所有的人造建筑。它们间隔不均，似乎没有人费心去妥善种植；或许它们是从风中带来的种子发芽而生。此刻，它们的枝条光秃秃的，显得孤寂凄凉，像是夏日丰盈的幽灵，触感冰冷而死寂。明日香伸手触碰其中一棵，注意到枝梢上的细小芽苞。生命仍在继续。

They had come for Rei.  
他们是为了绫波而来。

Not that they were expecting to bring her home. Shinji had no plans to bring her to California, where she would put on endless layers of sunblock to protect her skin. Asuka had no plans to find her a job in the ice cream parlor.  
并非指望将她带回家。真嗣并无意带她去加州，在那里她得涂抹无数层防晒霜来保护肌肤。明日香也没打算为她找份冰淇淋店的工作。

No, they had only come to put an end to everything, but one person who should have been there was missing.  
不，他们只是来终结一切的，但本该在场的那个人却不见了。

One whose life begun and ended here. The one who piloted the prototype, Evangelion 00. The one whom Asuka had once teased mercilessly, calling her "The Favorite" and "Wondergirl".  
一个生命始于斯、终于斯的人。驾驶原型机，零号机的那位。曾被明日香无情戏弄，称她为“宠儿”和“奇迹女孩”的那位。

They didn't know what had become of her. Ritsuko had confirmed that she had simply ceased to exist. She had vanished into a footnote of history.  
他们不知道她后来怎样了。律子确认说她就这样不复存在了。她消失在了历史的脚注中。

"We left because we had places to go, things we wanted to do," Shinji said quietly, his voice filled with emotion. "She didn't want to leave. She had nowhere to go. When Nerv disintegrated there was nothing left for her."  
"我们离开是因为我们有地方要去，有事情想做，" 真嗣轻声说道，声音中充满了情感。"她不想离开。她无处可去。当 NERV 解体时，她一无所有。"

"What about your father?" Asuka asked.  
"那你的父亲呢？" 明日香问道。

A muscle in his cheek twitched at the mention of his father. "She was a tool for him," he ground out furiously. "He abandoned her in the end. I haven't spoken to him since I left Nerv, and I don't intend to ever again.  
提到他父亲时，他脸颊上的肌肉抽搐了一下。"她对他来说只是一个工具，" 他愤怒地咬牙说道。"最终他抛弃了她。自从离开 NERV 后，我就没再和他说过话，我也不打算再和他有任何联系。

"What about you?" he asked. "What about your...past?"  
"那你呢？" 他问道。"关于你的...过去？"

Asuka shifted. It was still a sensitive subject for her, and both of them knew it. "I decided to let it go," she said quietly. "I don't plan to find anyone—and I don't want to relive anything. Misato and I agreed that this is for the best—that I've completely restarted my life—in a good way."  
明日香挪了挪身子。这对她来说仍然是个敏感话题，两人都心知肚明。"我决定放下它，"她轻声说，"我不打算寻找任何人——也不想重温任何事。美里和我都认为这是最好的——我已经彻底重启了我的生活——以一种好的方式。"

Shinji nodded. He was relieved.  
真嗣点点头。他感到宽慰。

They knew even less about the technicians. Maya Ibuki had apparently kept in contact with Ritsuko for a short time, and Makoto Hyuga with Misato, but eventually all four had found a new life away from angels and Evas and grown apart. No one knew anything about Shigeru Aoba. Shinji recalled his love for the guitar and hoped that he was well.  
他们对技术人员了解得更少。玛雅·伊吹显然曾与律子保持过一段时间的联系，而真希波·真理·伊吹则与美里有过往来，但最终，四人都远离了天使与 EVA，找到了新的生活，渐行渐远。没有人知道青叶茂的情况。真嗣记得他热爱吉他，希望他一切安好。

_It seems the sort of cemetery Rei would have chosen for herself,_ Asuka thought, her thoughts returning to the blue-haired girl. _Away from other people, in a sort of beautiful solitude._ She wondered what the grove looked like in full bloom, not recognizing any of the trees. Perhaps some would bloom pale blue flowers.  
阿斯卡觉得这像是丽会为自己选择的墓地，她的思绪回到了蓝发女孩身上。远离人群，处于一种美丽的孤独之中。她想知道这片小树林在盛开时会是什么样子，她认不出任何一棵树。也许有些会开淡蓝色的花。

That drew her thoughts back to the bouquet of flowers they had purchased on the way here. It was fairly simple, with daisies and lilies and irises and an occasional sprig of baby's breath all wrapped in plastic pink paper that crinkled under her grip. She glanced up at Shinji, who wore a look of deep sadness.  
这让她想起了他们在来这里的路上买的那束花。它相当简单，有雏菊、百合、鸢尾花，偶尔还有一枝满天星，全部包裹在塑料粉色纸中，纸在她握紧的手中沙沙作响。她抬头看向真嗣，他脸上带着深深的悲伤。

_I could almost believe that Rei might be sitting just around a corner, reading silently, while life goes on around her—without her.  
我几乎可以相信丽可能就坐在某个转角，静静地阅读，而生活继续在她周围流转——与她无关。_

_It's not only a resting place for Rei,_ he thought, _but for our hopes and dreams. Our fears and nightmares. The days of angels and Evas and SEELE and Nerv are over—all buried here.  
他心想，这里不仅是丽的安息之地，也是我们希望与梦想的归宿。我们的恐惧与噩梦。天使、EVA、SEELE 和 NERV 的日子已经结束——一切都埋葬于此。  
_  
Silence reigned. 寂静统治着一切。

Asuka was thinking of Ritsuko's words. "Ceased to exist," she echoed hollowly. The wind picked up her words and scattered them. "What a terrible end."  
明日香反复思索着律子的话。“不复存在了。”她空洞地重复着。风卷走了这些话语，散落无踪。“多么可怕的结局。”

Shinji didn't reply, but one solitary tear was making its way down his left cheek.  
真嗣没有回答，但一滴孤独的泪珠正顺着他的左脸颊缓缓滑落。

The redhead lowered her head and closed her eyes. A moment later she opened them again and her gaze came to rest on a small tree that came barely to her waist. Its first buds were ready to burst into soft petals, yet its branches were still bare. Asuka stepped over to it ceremonially and placed her bouquet at the bottom of the trunk. There was a short pause before she decided the pink paper was out of place, and ripped it off. She didn't want anything to disturb Rei.  
红发少女低下头，闭上了眼睛。片刻后她再次睁开眼，目光停留在一棵仅及她腰间的小树上。它的第一个花蕾即将绽放成柔软的花瓣，但枝条依旧光秃。明日香庄重地走过去，将花束放在树干底部。短暂的停顿后，她觉得粉红色的包装纸格格不入，便将其撕下。她不希望任何东西打扰到丽。

"Let's go," Shinji said, placing his arm awkwardly around her shoulder. Asuka looked up to see that the tear had vanished. Instead, he was looking straight ahead, a determined look on his face, ready to face the future. He blinked—and for just a fleeting instant—Asuka saw the grief he had suffered for Rei. She was neither jealous nor hurt. She felt the same tumult of emotions.  
"我们走吧，" 真嗣说道，尴尬地将手臂搭在她的肩上。明日香抬头一看，发现泪水已经消失。相反，他直视前方，脸上带着坚定的表情，准备迎接未来。他眨了眨眼——就在那一瞬间——明日香看到了他为丽所承受的悲伤。她既不嫉妒也不受伤。她感受到了同样的情感纷乱。

Shinji stepped backwards and turned away, keeping his arm around her. They were halfway back to the car before Asuka ducked her head and freed herself from Shinji's hold.  
真嗣后退一步，转身避开，手臂依然环绕着她。他们走到一半回车的时候，明日香低下头，挣脱了真嗣的怀抱。

"Wait a moment," she called, running back to the makeshift memorial.  
"等一下，" 她喊道，跑回那个临时纪念碑。

Asuka slid to a stop on her knees and quickly unbuttoned her jacket. Hidden in the deep folds of her jacket was the photo that Shinji had given her in California months ago—the one of herself, Shinji, and Rei walking down the street with their schoolbags. Asuka had carefully laminated it for this purpose, and now she laid it against the bouquet of flowers. She took one last look at it, running her fingers over the sharp edges, then got up and brushed the snow off of her knees.  
明日香双膝一屈，滑行着停下，迅速解开外套的扣子。在她外套的深褶中藏着一张照片，是几个月前在加州真嗣给她的——上面是她、真嗣和绫波背着书包走在街上的合影。明日香为了这个目的特意将其过塑，现在她将它靠在花束上。她最后看了一眼，用手指抚过锋利的边缘，然后站起身来，拍掉膝盖上的雪。

"Ready?" Shinji asked, as she came running up to him.  
"准备好了吗？" 她跑向他时，真嗣问道。

"I'm ready," she replied softly, climbing into the car.  
"我准备好了，" 她轻声回答，爬进车里。

Shinji smiled and put a hand over hers as the engine whirred to life. They drove away in a soft breeze, one that bowed the many branches of the grove, and ruffled the silky petals of Asuka's bouquet.  
真嗣微笑着，将手覆在她的手上，引擎随之启动。他们在轻柔的微风中驶离，那微风轻抚着林间众多枝条，也撩动了明日香花束中柔滑的花瓣。

Author's Notes: Wow, now that this fanfic is over, I have lots of things to say...  
作者的话：哇，这篇同人文完结后，我有很多话想说...

First of all, I have to apologize again for the lateness of this epilogue—I promised it would be up a long time ago, and I never got it up. Sorry!  
首先，我必须再次为这篇后记的迟到道歉——我曾承诺很久以前就会发布，却一直未能兑现。对不起！

This was the original ending I planned from the beginning, with a few changes. (This is the second draft—I took out some Shinji/Asuka romance things and changed the setting from early spring to winter.) I wanted for there to be some closure and not always have the question of the past hovering over their heads. Also, I didn't want an ending in which Shinji asks Asuka to marry him and they live happily ever after; I wanted to leave it relatively open.  
这是我最初计划的原始结局，做了一些改动。（这是第二稿——我删除了一些碇真嗣和明日香之间的浪漫情节，并将背景从初春改为了冬季。）我希望给他们一些结局，不再总是让过去的疑问悬在他们头上。此外，我也不想要一个碇真嗣向明日香求婚并从此幸福生活的结局；我希望结局相对开放。

Looking back at the fic now, I think that the chapters detailing Asuka's car accident and her recovery were really, really rushed, but then again, the story became much longer than I originally expected for it to be. Other than that, I was fairly pleased with the outcome of the story.  
现在回顾这篇同人文，我认为详细描述明日香车祸和她康复的章节确实非常仓促，但话说回来，故事的长度远远超出了我最初的预期。除此之外，我对故事的最终结果相当满意。

And lastly, I could not have done it without all of your support. Thanks so much to jennyjennai, Hououza (I hope more animes come to the UK soon!), Asuka201 (I'll be keeping up with your translation—thank you!), nicknack (sorry, I promise I'll be nicer to Rei in my next fic—you can call me a Rei- hater all you want now), SonLee16, windwingxs, supereva 01-02, "New, too lazy to log on..."
