Late at night in the middle of a power outage, Asuka realizes she might have to turn to her roommate for help staying warm.  
在一个停电的深夜，明日香意识到她可能需要依靠室友来取暖。

### Chapter 1 Rolling Blackouts
Supposedly, it was to conserve power for defense. Even when not in times of crisis, the enormous amount of electricity it took to move any part of the Evangelions at all was taxing on Japan's power grid. When there were Angels to be fought and lives were on the line, there was simply not enough power to always keep Tokyo-3 alight. On the whole, people were willing to sacrifice late night television to prevent the Third Impact.  
据称，此举是为了节约防御所需的电力。即便在平常时期，移动使徒的任何部分所消耗的巨大电量已对日本电网构成压力。而在对抗使徒、生死攸关之际，电力往往不足以维持第三新东京市的夜间照明。总体而言，为了预防第三次冲击，人们甘愿放弃深夜电视节目。

And so the blackouts. 就这样，停电发生了。

It was scheduled of course, so in theory the citizens of Tokyo-3 would be able to plan around the inconvenience. The sections of the city that would lose power were broadcast on the television weeks in advance, detailing exactly what time the power would go out for what areas, and when it would return. Unlike the blackouts however, checking to see the scheduled time of the power outage was not compulsory.  
当然，这是预先安排的，因此理论上，东京-3 的市民可以围绕这一不便进行规划。城市中将停电的区域在电视上提前几周播出，详细说明了各个区域何时停电，以及何时恢复供电。然而，查看停电计划时间并非强制性的，这与停电情况不同。

And so Asuka had forgotten to check the times. And now it was cold.  
因此，明日香忘了查看时间，现在天气变得很冷。

She shivered under her single thin sheet and cursed herself for the millionth time for not packing her heavy blankets when she had moved from Germany. She could have left out some of her seemingly endless supply of bathing suits and summer dresses to make room for one damn comforter. It's not like she ever got the chance to _wear_ any of her cute clothes. School uniforms – really should have thought that one through. As if there was anyone in Japan worth impressing anyway…  
她裹在单薄的床单里瑟瑟发抖，又一次懊恼自己从德国搬来时没带上厚毯子。她本可以少带些似乎永远也穿不完的泳衣和夏装，腾出空间来放一条厚被子。毕竟，她似乎从未有机会穿上那些可爱的衣服。学校制服——这事儿真该好好考虑。好像在日本有谁值得她去打动似的……

Asuka felt a chill run down her spine and pulled the sheet tighter. It wasn't helping anything, and the Japanese winter was proving unforgiving even through the walls of the shared flat. She heard snow hitting the window on the other side of the room, the wind howling all around the building, and she felt very alone.  
明日香感到一阵寒意从脊背直窜而下，她紧紧拉了拉床单。然而这并未带来丝毫暖意，日本的严冬透过合租公寓的墙壁依旧冷酷无情。她听见雪花敲打在房间另一侧的窗户上，风声在整栋楼周围呼啸，她感到异常孤单。

She hated feeling alone, and it happened so often lately. She missed seeing Kaji on a daily basis, and even the other people she knew back home. There hadn't been many friends, but there were a couple of girls she would eat lunch with sometimes, when Kaji was busy. They were good company, and they had seemed to like her, but she hadn't kept in contact with them once transferring overseas. Asuka felt a little guilty about this at first, but it wasn't as if they had reached out to her, either. She wasn't sure if it counted as friendship if no one cared when it began or ended. She wondered if anyone in this country would worry about her when she shipped back home.  
她厌倦了孤独的感觉，最近这种情况频繁发生。她怀念与 Kaji 的日常相见，以及在家乡认识的其他人。虽然朋友不多，但有时在 Kaji 忙碌时，她会与几个女孩共进午餐。她们相处融洽，似乎也对她有好感，但自从她转学海外后，便与她们失去了联系。起初，明日香对此感到一丝愧疚，但她们也未曾主动联系她。她不确定，如果无人关心这段友谊的开始与结束，这还能否称之为友谊。她不禁思索，当她回国时，是否会有这个国家的人为她担忧。

She reminded herself that it was the providence of geniuses and prodigies to always be alone, out in front of everyone else looking back. She didn't feel any warmer.  
她提醒自己，天才和神童注定要孤独前行，走在所有人前面，让其他人回望。她并未因此感到一丝温暖。

Asuka sat up, hugging her arms to herself and glancing over at the wall.  
明日香坐直身子，双臂环抱自己，目光不经意地瞥向墙壁。

Shinji was on the other side of that wall. She had run into him briefly, earlier in the evening, right as the power had gone out. He had been carrying blankets and looking very smug. The Third Child, evidently, had not forgotten to check the schedule.  
真嗣就在那堵墙的另一侧。傍晚时分，她曾与他短暂相遇，恰逢停电之际。他手拿毯子，神情自得。显然，这位第三适格者并未忘记查看日程安排。

A message on the answering machine had let the pilots know that Misato had opted to spend the night inside the Geofront. NERV's headquarters was one of the few places in the city where the power never went out, and there was surely a bed hidden somewhere in the massive facility she could lay down on. At the very worst: somewhere lurked a space heater and a wall to lean against. Misato was resourceful.  
答录机中的一条留言告知飞行员们，美里决定在 Geofront 过夜。NERV 总部是城市里为数不多电力始终稳定的地方，那里必定有一张床供她休息。即便情况再糟，也能找到取暖器和墙壁依靠。美里总是能巧妙应对。

Asuka was envious of the woman's foresight. She realized miserably that her only real option was to walk to Shinji's room and ask him for one of his blankets.  
明日香羡慕那位女士的远见。她无奈地发现，自己唯一能做的就是去真嗣的房间，向他讨一条毯子。

She clenched her teeth. _Screw that_, she thought. She'd never hear the end of it.  
她咬紧牙关，心想：“管它呢。”她知道这事没完没了。

But still, the other option at this point seemed to be to sit in her room and succumb to hypothermia. How long did these damn blackouts last again? She couldn't remember for the life of her.  
尽管如此，此刻另一个选择似乎只能是坐在房间里，任由体温过低侵袭。这些讨厌的停电究竟持续了多长时间？她怎么也想不起来。

Asuka put her ear to the wall, wincing as her cheek touched the icy plaster. She closed her eyes and strained to hear if Shinji was still awake. Maybe she could sneak in and _steal_ a blanket so she wouldn't have to talk to him at all? There was a faint noise, but Asuka couldn't figure out what it was exactly. It almost sounded like a window sliding open, but she couldn't think of a single reason why anyone would be stupid enough to open their window during a storm like-  
明日香将耳朵紧贴在墙上，当脸颊触及冰冷的墙面时，她微微皱眉。她闭上双眼，竭力聆听真嗣是否仍未入睡。或许她能悄无声息地潜入，偷走一条毯子，从而避免与他交谈。她听到一丝微弱的声响，却难以辨明其确切来源。那声音近似于窗户被推开，但她实在想不出，在如此狂风暴雨中，谁会如此愚蠢地打开窗户——

"Asuka?" 飞鸟？

Asuka sprung away from the wall immediately and pretended to be asleep. Shinji stood in her doorway, flashlight in one hand. His brow knit with slight confusion.  
明日香迅速从墙边跳开，佯装入睡。真嗣站在她房门口，一手握着手电筒，眉头微蹙，显露出些许困惑。

"…what were you just doing?"  
“…你刚刚在忙什么？”

"Wh-what are you talking about, you idiot?" She propped herself up on her arms, faking a yawn. "I was sleeping! You know, what most _normal_ people are doing this time of the night!" Asuka was blushing furiously, despite herself. She hoped he didn't see in the low light, or notice how stupid her babbling sounded. "What are you doing in my room, anyway? When did I give you permission to come in?"  
你-你在说什么呢，白痴？" 她用双臂撑起身体，假装打了个哈欠。"我刚才在睡觉！你知道的，大多数正常人在这个时间点都在做的事情！" 尽管如此，明日香的脸还是涨得通红。她希望他在昏暗的光线下没看到，或者没注意到她那番胡言乱语听起来有多蠢。"不管怎样，你在我房间里做什么？我什么时候允许你进来的？

Shinji shrugged. 真嗣耸耸肩。

"Sorry. Look, I brought you some more layers." Asuka noticed for the first time that Shinji had stuffed an armful of blankets in the hand not holding the torch. He turned slightly so she could see them. "I thought you might be cold."  
抱歉。瞧，我又给你拿了几条毯子。" 明日香这才注意到，真嗣另一只手里抱满了毯子。他侧身让她看清楚。"我担心你会冷。

"Cold? Oh, is it snowing?" Asuka looked out the window. "Wow! I hadn't even noticed. I'm fine, you just worry about yourself, okay?" She pulled the thin sheet up to her chin and wished for her teeth to stop chattering.  
"冷吗？哦，下雪了？" 明日香朝窗外看去。"哇！我都没注意到。我没事，你只管照顾好自己，好吗？" 她把薄薄的床单拉到下巴，希望牙齿不再打颤。

Shinji stood in the doorway.  
真嗣站在门口处。

"…you look cold." He remarked.  
“…你看起来很冷。” 他这样说道。

Asuka shot up from her bed.  
明日香突然从床上坐起。

"I said 'I'm fine', Ikari! I mean, jeez, if you want to leave some of the stupid blankets there, then go ahead, but I don't need your charity! I'm trying to sleep!" Asuka waved her arms around wildly, partially to bring them warmth and partially to distract from her shivering.  
“我说了‘我很好’，碇！真是的，如果你想留下那些没用的毯子，随你便，但我可不需要你的怜悯！我正努力入睡呢！”明日香挥舞着手臂，一方面是为了取暖，另一方面也是为了掩饰自己的颤抖。

She didn't understand why she did this to herself. Asuka realized that Shinji was actually offering her exactly what she had wanted – what she had been very close to walking next door and _demanding_, as a matter of fact – but when they were offered to her like this it made her feel… what was the word...?  
她不明白自己为何如此。明日香意识到，真嗣其实是在给予她一直渴望的东西——甚至她差点就走到隔壁去索要了——然而，当这些东西这样摆在她面前时，她感到……那个词是什么来着……？

Dependent. 依赖项。

Asuka Langley Sohryu was not dependent on anyone, least of all Shinji Ikari. She was a genius. She was in front of the pack looking back. She was alo-  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不依赖他人，更不用说碇真嗣了。她是个天才，总是领先一步，回眸一瞥。她是孤独的-

"You know what?" Asuka threw the sheet off of herself and leapt to her feet. "I'm up now, and I'm hungry. I'm grabbing some food."  
你知道吗？" 明日香掀开被子，一跃而起，说道："我现在醒了，肚子也饿了，得去弄点吃的。

Asuka muscled her way past Shinji into the mutual dining area, which she soon discovered was completely black.  
明日香用力挤过真嗣，进入了共用餐厅，却发现里面一片漆黑。

"Hey, gimme that flashlight." The redhead snatched the torch from Shinji's hand and illuminated the cabinets all around them.  
"嘿，把手电筒给我。" 红发女子从真嗣手中抢过手电筒，照亮了四周的橱柜。

"How many shirts do you have on?" Shinji asked off-hand. Asuka spun on him venomously.  
"你穿了几件衬衫？" 真嗣不经意地问。明日香恶狠狠地瞪向他。

"_Sheiße!_ Mind your own business Ikari! Honestly! I don't need your damn blankets!" She whirled on the cabinets. "Where the hell's the herbal tea, anyway? Pen-Pen's always friggin' moving things in this house…"  
该死！碇，别多管闲事！真是的！我可不需要你那讨厌的毯子！" 她转身对着橱柜。"草药茶到底放哪儿了？Pen-Pen 老是乱动家里的东西……

_Anything to keep warm, anything to keep warm, I don't need him, anything to keep warm...  
为了保暖，什么都行，我不需要他，只要能保暖..._

Her hand brushed against the box for the Mint Medley and Asuka felt a rush of triumph sweep over her.  
她的手不经意间触碰到了薄荷混合口味的盒子，明日香顿时感到一股胜利的喜悦涌遍全身。

"Ha! Finally! Where's the teapot?"  
哈！终于找到了！茶壶在哪里？

"Um… the stove's not working."  
哎呀…炉子好像坏了。

The flashlight turned accusingly on Shinji, illuminating him brilliantly in the black.  
手电筒仿佛带着责备之意照向真嗣，在黑暗中将他照得异常明亮。

"It needs electricity, Asuka. So does the microwave." Shinji laughed lightly. "Didn't you go to college?"  
它需要电力，明日香。微波炉也一样。" 真嗣轻轻笑了笑。"你没上过大学吗？

The small box of tea rocketed through the air and hit Shinji in the nose, stunning him for a second. A hand quickly grabbed the scruff of his neck and he felt himself being violently shaken.  
那小盒茶叶如离弦之箭般飞过空中，正中真嗣的鼻梁，令他一时愣住。随即，一只手猛地抓住他的后颈，他被剧烈地摇晃起来。

"Don't you talk down to me! I'm the best damn pilot in this _hemisphere_! You should be on your knees worshipping me, _BAKA_! When I was in Germany I had so many frien-"  
别小瞧我！我是这个半球最出色的飞行员！你该跪下膜拜我才对，傻瓜！我在德国时朋友多得很——

"Would you cut it out?" Shinji shook himself free of his tormentor's grasp and glared with irritation at where he assumed Asuka's head was. "What's the matter with you, anyway? Your hands are freezing. Just take the blankets and go to bed."  
你能别闹了吗？" 真嗣挣脱了对方的束缚，带着恼怒的眼神朝他认为是明日香头部的方向瞪去。"你到底怎么回事？手冷得像冰一样。拿上毯子去睡觉吧。

Shinji turned to go back to his room. "...you're welcome."  
真嗣转身返回自己的房间，轻声说道：“……不用谢。”

The flashlight hit him in the back of the head when he was two steps away from his door.  
就在他离自家门口还有两步之遥时，手电筒重重地打在了他的后脑勺上。

Shinji spun around, angrily. "There is something fucking wrong with you!" He bellowed into the darkness. "I was trying to be nice!"  
真嗣愤怒地转过身，吼道：“你他妈的绝对有问题！”他对着黑暗大声咆哮，“我刚才还想对你好点呢！”

No response came from the kitchen. When the flashlight had hit him, Shinji had vaguely heard the batteries fly out from the back of it, and now the entire apartment was under cover of darkness.  
厨房那边毫无反应。手电筒的光线照射到他时，真嗣隐约听到电池从手电筒后部弹出，整个公寓随即陷入一片漆黑。

Shinji sighed. He slunk to the floor, massaging the back of his head.  
真嗣叹了口气，缓缓蹲下身子，轻轻按摩着后脑勺。

"God damn it... That really hurt, Asuka."  
真是的...真的好痛，明日香。

Silence. He took a deep breath before continuing.  
沉默片刻。他深吸一口气，接着说下去。

"I don't understand you at all. I don't get why-" Shinji cut himself off and shook his head.  
"我完全不懂你的意思。我不明白为什么——" 真嗣突然停下，摇了摇头。

He stood up. "Nevermind. It doesn't matter. I'm going to bed."  
他起身说道：“算了，无所谓。我要去睡了。”

He felt for his door.  
他摸索着寻找门的位置。

"'You don't get why' what?" Asuka's voice was closer than Shinji had expected it to be, and he jumped a little, despite himself. "What were you going to say?" she asked.  
"‘你不懂为什么’是什么意思？" 明日香的声音比真嗣预料的更近，他不禁微微一跳。"你刚才想说什么？" 她追问道。

Shinji leaned his head against the wall.  
真嗣将头倚靠在墙边。

"It's stupid," he admitted.  
“这真是愚蠢，”他坦承。

"A lot of what you say is stupid." It was an insult, but in the darkness it was somehow softened. Shinji swore he could almost hear a smile behind her voice. "Tell me anyway."  
你说的话很多都很愚蠢。" 这本是一句侮辱，但在黑暗中，语气却意外地柔和了。真嗣几乎能感觉到她声音中带着一丝笑意。"尽管如此，还是告诉我吧。

Shinji sighed. The blackness made him feel like he was talking to someone else. It made things easier to say – there were things he had to get off of his chest.  
真嗣叹了口气，黑暗让他感觉像是在对另一个人倾诉。这使得一些难以启齿的话变得容易说出口——有些心事他必须一吐为快。

"I don't get why… we're not friends," Shinji began. "We live together. We work together. We're in the same class. We use the same shower for God's sake. We share so many things, Asuka. Probably more than I share with any other person alive. Why don't we get along?"  
我不明白为什么……我们不是朋友，" 真嗣开始说道。"我们住在一起，一起工作，还在同一个班级。甚至用同一个淋浴间。我们分享了这么多东西，明日香。可能比我和任何其他活着的人分享的都多。为什么我们不能好好相处呢？

No answer. 未作答。

"I mean, I've always tried to be nice to you," he continued. "I just don't understand why you hate me so much. Did I do something to offend you? You seem to be friends with Hikari-chan, which is great, but I mean..."  
“我是说，我一直都尽量对你好，”他接着说，“我不懂你为何这么讨厌我。我是不是无意中得罪了你？你和光莉是朋友，这很好，但我真的不明白……”

He shook his head, the pain at the back of his skull flaring up. "You know what? I don't really care. I don't care what it is you have against me, or why you throw fucking flashlights at me when I'm trying to help you, or if you freeze to death in your room. I just don't care anymore. I'm going to bed."  
他摇摇头，后脑勺的疼痛猛然加剧。“你知道吗？我真的无所谓了。不管你对我有什么不满，也不管为什么在我好心帮你时朝我扔那些该死的闪光灯，甚至不管你会不会在你的房间里冻死。我都不再关心了。我要去睡觉了。”

He turned to his door and slid it open. For a moment, Shinji paused to see if she was going to say something – anything.  
他转身向自己的门，轻轻推开。片刻间，真嗣停下脚步，想看看她是否会开口说些什么——哪怕一句话。

Nothing happened. 什么事都没发生。

Shinji began to step through the door when he felt a small tug on the back of his shirt, and the pressure stopped him in his tracks. She was standing right behind him. He heard her breathing in the dark, uneven and slightly raspy.  
真嗣正要跨过门时，突然感到衬衫后背被轻轻一拽，这股力量让他立刻停了下来。她就在他身后站着。在黑暗中，他听到了她不均匀且略带沙哑的呼吸声。

After what seemed like an eternity, she opened her mouth to speak.  
仿佛经历了漫长的等待，她终于开口说话了。

"...do you hate me?" ...你是不是讨厌我？

Her voice was tiny. It sounded like she was admitting her deepest secret. "I know I can be difficult sometimes, but... I've always sort of considered us..."  
她的声音微弱，仿佛在吐露心底最深的秘密。“我明白自己有时难以相处，然而……我一直觉得我们之间……”

Shinji had never heard this tone of voice come from the proud German pilot. It sounded so meek. He tried to imagine what her face could possibly look like at this moment.  
真嗣从未听过这位骄傲的德国飞行员用如此温顺的语气说话。他努力想象她此刻的表情究竟会是什么样子。

He felt her take a small step closer. "I mean, do you really...?"  
他察觉到她轻轻地挪近了一步。“我是说，你真的……？”

God, she sounded so fragile. He thought of her blue eyes and how angry they usually were. What did those eyes look like when they were vulnerable, when they could be hurt? _Could_ she be hurt? Shinji found it hard to believe anything ever got through that tough skin of hers.  
天哪，她的声音听起来如此脆弱。他回想起她那双蓝色的眼睛，平时总是充满怒火。当它们流露出脆弱，当它们可能受伤时，那双眼睛会是什么样子？她真的会受伤吗？真嗣觉得很难相信有什么能突破她那坚强的外表。

Shinji sighed. He was so tired. His head ached.  
真嗣叹了口气，感到疲惫不堪，头痛欲裂。

"You know, Asuka. Sometimes, I really do."  
“你知道吗，明日香。有时候，我确实是这样想的。”

Shinji stepped out of her grip and slid the door shut behind him.  
真嗣挣脱了她的束缚，随后将门轻轻合上。

He found the sheets outside of his door the next morning, folded and cold.  
次日清晨，他在门外找到了折叠整齐、冰凉的床单。

### Chapter 2 No one Else, part 1
"She hasn't spoken to me in three days. I have no idea what's going on in her head right now." Shinji sipped his thermos of tea and shivered slightly. The snow falling outside made the classroom unusually chilly, and the warm liquid helped a little. He was glad he had remembered to pack some this morning. "Not that I usually do anyway."  
"她已经三天没跟我说话了。我完全猜不透她现在心里在想什么。" 真嗣啜饮着保温瓶里的茶，身体微微颤抖。外面的雪让教室变得异常寒冷，这温暖的茶水多少带来些许慰藉。他庆幸自己今早记得带了些茶来，尽管这并非他平时的习惯。

"She looks pissed." Touji glanced over towards Asuka and Hikari. The girls were on the other side of the room, eating their lunches together. "Kinda like she's going to kill something."  
她看上去很生气。" 透治朝明日香和光的方向瞥了一眼。女孩们在房间的另一边，一起吃着午餐。"感觉她像是要对什么东西下杀手似的。

"What else is new?" Shinji didn't look over towards his two classmates. He spent enough time avoiding eye contact with Asuka at home. He wondered briefly where Rei was today. The First Child's school attendance was so spotty it was a small wonder whenever she showed up.  
"还有什么新鲜事吗？" 真嗣并未转向他的两位同学。在家中，他已经习惯了避免与明日香对视。他短暂地思索了一下，今天绫波会在哪里。第一适格者的到校情况总是时有时无，她能出现确实是个小惊喜。

Touji was sitting on the desk directly to Shinji's right, and was turned slightly so as to observe the redheaded girl. Kensuke was on his left, picking thoughtfully at his lunch. Shinji, for his part, faced away from Asuka and Hikari.  
冬二坐在真嗣右边的桌子上，稍稍侧身观察着那位红发女孩。剑介在他左侧，心不在焉地挑拣着午餐。而真嗣则背对着明日香和光。

With the weather as bad as it was, lunch was relegated to the classroom, which always put Touji in a slightly irritated state of mind. He missed the roof. Whatever Asuka had whispered to her friend just made Hikari blush. Touji felt a mysterious sting of jealousy, which he attributed to his lack of ability to communicate with the any of the female members of his class. _What do girls talk about, anyway?_  
天气恶劣，午餐只能在教室里进行，这让宗介感到有些烦躁。他怀念在屋顶用餐的时光。无论明日香对她朋友说了什么悄悄话，都让光子脸红了。宗介感到一阵莫名的嫉妒，他认为这是自己与班上女生沟通能力不足所致。女孩子之间到底会聊些什么呢？

"I don't know, Shinji," Kensuke began, rubbing the back of his head. "Maybe you should just apologize? I mean, what you did was kind of..." He groped for words.  
"我不太清楚，真嗣，" 健介开口道，一边揉着后脑勺。"或许你该道个歉？毕竟，你那样做确实有点..." 他一时找不到合适的词来表达。

Shinji raised his eyebrows expectantly.  
真嗣满怀期待地扬起了眉毛。

"...mean?" Kensuke finished timidly. He shrugged, holding his palms up, showing he meant no harm.  
‘...是什么意思？’健介怯生生地问完。他耸了耸肩，双手摊开，示意自己并无恶意。

"She keeps looking over here." Touji narrowed his eyes. "She's kind of starting to freak me out."  
她不停地朝这边看。透治眯起眼睛，说道：“她这样让我有点不安。”

Shinji sighed, putting down his drink.  
真嗣叹了口气，放下了手中的饮料。

The three days since the blackout had been terrible for Shinji, but not because Asuka had been particularly mean to him. As soon as his door had shut that night, Shinji had regretted being so cold to her. She had reached out to him, and he should have been the bigger person and accepted the gesture of friendship for what it was. But of course that hadn't happened. He could never seem to do these kinds of things correctly.  
停电后的这三天对真嗣来说非常糟糕，但这并不是因为明日香对他特别刻薄。那天晚上他一关门，就后悔对她那么冷淡。她向他伸出了援手，他本应该表现得更大度，接受这份友谊的表示。但当然，这并没有发生。他似乎永远无法正确处理这类事情。

Afterwards, Shinji had feared the fallout – he had expected to wake up the next morning to the absolute worst verbal abuse he had ever endured. He had expected the Queen Bitch: the person everyone who didn't actually know Asuka assumed her to be. Shinji was prepared to accept all of what he knew he deserved.  
事后，真嗣对可能的后果感到恐惧——他预料到第二天醒来会面临前所未有的言语攻击。他想象中的“女王蜂”，是那些并不真正了解明日香的人对她的普遍印象。真嗣已经做好了承受他所认为的自己应得的一切的心理准备。

But that didn't happen. 然而，那件事并未发生。

Shinji had woken to find the folded blankets and an empty apartment. She hadn't even waited for him to walk to school, like she did every day. There was a note explaining she had made her own lunch, so his assistance in that department wasn't necessary, and when he had walked into the classroom she was already in her seat.  
真嗣醒来时，发现毯子已被叠好，公寓里空无一人。她甚至没等他一起上学，这和往常不同。桌上留了张字条，说她已自备午餐，无需他帮忙。当他走进教室时，她已经坐在自己的座位上了。

His attempts to approach her had been completely futile. Shinji had said a lot of things to his roommate's back the last three days, none of which were met with any kind of real response. Asuka talked to him only when absolutely necessary, and in as non-comittal terms as possible. Each afternoon she had walked home, to her room, and shut the door, not emerging save for necessities.  
他试图接近她的尝试彻底失败了。过去三天里，真嗣对着室友的背影说了许多话，却未得到任何实质回应。明日香只有在绝对必要时才与他交谈，且尽可能保持含糊其辞。每天下午，她独自走回房间，关上门，除了必需品外不再外出。

She had spent the last three days acting like Shinji didn't exist. Or rather that he did exist, but she simply didn't care at all.  
过去三天里，她一直装作真嗣不存在似的。准确地说，她承认他的存在，但对他毫不在意。

He reflected ruefully on how many times he had wished she would stop tormenting him and just leave him alone. Oh, the irony. Everything felt so strained and awkard now. He used to know exactly where he stood with Asuka, and now nothing seemed certain at all. Misato was starting to notice, but had been polite enough not to say anything yet. Shinji couldn't wait for the other shoe to drop. This was hell.  
他苦涩地反思，自己曾多少次希望她停止折磨，让他独自一人。哦，这讽刺的滋味。如今一切变得如此紧张而尴尬。他过去对与明日香的关系了如指掌，现在却似乎一切都难以捉摸。美里开始察觉，却一直礼貌地保持沉默。真嗣焦急地等待着那不可避免的时刻到来。这种境况，简直是地狱般的煎熬。

"She's getting up," Touji muttered.  
“她正在起床，” 冬二低声说道。

Shinji glanced up at the sound of Touji's voice. The other boy clenched his jaw.  
听到托基的声音，真嗣抬起头来。另一个男孩紧咬着牙关。

"Oh God, here she comes." Touji averted his eyes and turned, positioning himself as if he had been deeply embroiled in conversation with Shinji and Kensuke. "Get ready, Ikari. This is gonna be brutal."  
哦，天哪，她过来了。" 斗志转移目光，转身，摆出一副正与真嗣和健介热烈交谈的样子。"做好准备，一辉。这将会很棘手。

Shinji straightened up a little and prepared himself. _Finally._  
真嗣稍稍挺直了身子，做好了准备。终于到了这一刻。

Asuka came to a stop right outside of their closed circle and crossed her arms. Shinji let out a tremendous sigh and turned towards her.  
明日香在他们围成的圈子外站定，双臂交叉。真嗣长叹一声，转头看向她。

"Look, Asuka I-" 看，明日香，我——

"Suzuhara-kun." Asuka's voice cut through Shinji's like a knife. "I'd like to talk to you alone for a moment."  
铃原君。" 明日香的声音如利刃般穿透了真嗣的思绪。"我想和你单独聊聊。

Shinji blinked. 真嗣眨了眨眼睛。

Touji turned around warily, his brows knit with confusion. "...me?"  
冬二小心翼翼地转过身，眉头紧皱，带着困惑的神情。“……你在叫我吗？”

Asuka maintained complete eye contact with him. "I want to ask you something. Can we talk alone?" She seemed serious, and what Shinji could only describe as 'mysteriously polite'. Kensuke's mouth hung open slightly, shock overpowering his usual decision to keep it closed.  
明日香始终注视着他的眼睛。“我有件事想问你，能单独谈谈吗？”她的神情严肃，举止间透露出一种神秘的礼貌。健介惊讶得微微张开了嘴，往常的克制在这一刻被震惊所取代。

For a moment, no one had any idea what to say.  
那一刻，大家都不知道该说什么才好。

"Um... sure." Touji got down off the desk he had been sitting on and stood in front of the German girl. He cleared his throat awkardly. "...so, what's up?"  
嗯...当然。" 透治从桌子上跳下，站在那位德国女孩面前。他有些尴尬地清了清嗓子，问道："...那么，有什么事吗？

"Come here." Asuka grabbed Touji's wrist, dragging him across the room and out into the hallway. The door shut behind them with a decided note of menace – eavesdropping would be out of the question for anyone wishing to spend the rest of their lives with a complete set of limbs.  
"过来。" 明日香抓住冬二的手腕，将他拽过房间，拉到了走廊上。门在他们身后重重地关上，透出一股不容忽视的威胁——任何想要四肢健全度过余生的人都不会考虑偷听。

Shinji and Kensuke sat completely dumbfounded. Snow was heard gently pelting the window.  
真嗣和健介完全愣住了，只听见雪花轻轻地敲打着窗户。

Across the room, Hikari sat by herself, not particularly looking at anyone at all.  
在房间的另一侧，光一个人坐着，并没有特意看向任何人。

---

"No way in hell." 绝对没门。

"Why not?" 何乐而不为？

"NO."

"Oh, come on! As if an idiot like you has anything better to do this Thursday!"  
“哎呀，得了吧！你这种人这周四还能有什么更好的事做！”

"As a matter of fact, I do. Thursdays are when I visit my sister in the hospital."  
实际上，我确实会去。每周四我都会去医院探望我的姐姐。

"_Fine._ Friday then." 行，那就定在星期五。

"Can't." 不行。

"What the hell are you doing Friday!"  
你星期五到底在做什么？

"Not this." 不是这个。

"Have you ever seen me in my plugsuit? Or at gym?"  
你有没有见过我穿插电服的样子？或者在健身房的时候？

"Have I ever-? What's that got to do with _anything?_"  
我有过吗？这跟其他事情有什么关联？

"I've got a great body. I'm certainly not ugly."  
我身材很好，绝对不算丑。

"...I'm well aware of that."  
...我对此非常了解。

"Then say yes. You'll have bragging rights. I'll pay for the movie. Worst that could happen is we both hate each other and we agree to never do it again. You lose one Friday night."  
那就答应吧。你会有炫耀的资本。电影票我请。最糟糕的结果无非是我们彼此厌恶，然后约定再也不这样了。你只是错过了一个周五的夜晚。

"..."

"I already asked Hikari, and she said she didn't have a problem with it."  
我之前已经问过光，她表示对此没有异议。

"Wh-why would I give a rat's ass what the class rep thinks about this?"  
我干嘛要在乎班代表对此有什么想法？

"No reason in particular. Just thought you ought to know."  
没什么特别的原因，只是觉得你有必要知道。

Touji crossed his arms. So, this wasn't a joke. Asuka's face was completely impassive.  
冬二交叉着双臂，看来这并非玩笑。明日香的脸上毫无表情。

"...what movie, exactly?"  
...具体是哪部电影呢？

---

Asuka walked back into the classroom first, heading right back to Hikari and sitting down to finish her lunch. Touji entered moments later, walking unsteadily over to his seat next to Shinji and Kensuke.  
明日香率先回到教室，直接走向光和身边坐下，继续享用她的午餐。片刻之后，透司步履蹒跚地走进来，坐到了真嗣和健介旁边的座位上。

"What was _that_ all about?" Kensuke asked, desperate for information. 

Touji turned around, staring in the direction of Hikari and Asuka, completely and utterly perplexed. He looked at the girls for several more seconds before turning back towards his friends and picking up his chopsticks to continue eating.  
冬二转过身，目光锁定在光和明日香身上，满脸困惑。他多看了她们几秒，随后回过头，继续与朋友们用餐。

"She asked me on a date," he said. "I'm going out with her Friday night." 

Shinji's tea spilled all across his desk when it slipped from his hands.  
新司的茶不慎从手中滑落，桌面上顿时洒满了茶水。

---

"Asuka, wait up!" Shinji jogged to try and keep up with her. His breath came out in white clouds – he could feel himself sweating under his coat.  
"明日香，等等！" 真嗣加快脚步，努力追赶她的步伐。他的呼吸在寒冷中凝成白雾，能感觉到自己在大衣下微微出汗。

He had to catch up with her. Asuka had yet to break stride, or acknowledge Shinji's shouts in any capacity whatsoever.  
他必须追上她。明日香丝毫未减慢步伐，对真嗣的呼喊也毫无反应。

"Asuka, would you hold on for just one second?" Shinji slid on a particularly icy patch of sidewalk and nearly fell. The snow was getting heavier. Quickly regaining his balance, he put on a final burst of speed and caught up with his fellow pilot.  
"明日香，稍等一下好吗？" 真嗣在一个特别滑的人行道上滑了一下，差点摔倒。雪越下越大了。他迅速恢复平衡，最后加快速度，追上了他的同伴驾驶员。

"Hey, hold on. We have to talk about this." Shinji reached out and put a hand on Asuka's shoulder.  
"嘿，等一下。我们得谈谈这件事。" 真嗣伸出手，轻轻搭在明日香的肩上。

The reaction was immediate and electric. Asuka jerked her shoulder out of his hand and stopped walking. For the first time since their argument, her blue eyes met his full-on.  
反应来得迅速而强烈。明日香猛然从他手中挣脱肩膀，停下脚步。这是自争执以来，她第一次正面直视他的双眼。

"I really don't see what there is for us to discuss." Her voice held a startling ferocity. "Did you not understand today's lesson? Need me to explain it to you? I already went through college, you know." The sarcasm was palpable. Shinji clenched his fists.  
"我真的不明白我们有什么可讨论的。" 她的声音带着惊人的凶猛。"你今天没听懂课吗？需要我给你解释吗？我可是已经上过大学了，你知道的。" 讽刺之意显而易见。真嗣紧握拳头。

"You know damn well what we have to talk about!" Shinji exploded. "Touji? What the _hell?_"  
你明明知道我们得谈什么！" 真嗣爆发了。"托基？到底怎么回事？

"If I feel anything about Suzuhara-kun at all, it's really none of your business, is it?" Her eyes were like razors.  
“我对铃原君的感觉，与你无关，不是吗？”她的目光锐利如刀。

"What's with this 'Suzuhara-kun' business? He's Touji!" Shinji was winded from running to catch up, and shouting wasn't helping matters. Fortunately, the approaching storm had forced most people inside. The two teenagers were alone in the street. Shinji took a deep breath and continued. "You hate Touji!"  
为什么突然叫他'铃原君'？他可是冬二啊！" 真嗣因为一路奔跑追赶而喘不过气来，大声喊叫也无济于事。幸好，即将来临的风暴让大多数人躲进了屋内。此刻，街上只剩下这两个少年。真嗣深吸一口气，接着说："你明明讨厌冬二！

Asuka smirked slightly. "Is that so?" She glanced away for a second, smiling to herself. Shinji had no idea what she could possibly find funny right now. "I guess I hate a lot of people the first time that I meet them."  
明日香嘴角轻扬，“真的吗？”她短暂地移开目光，独自微笑。真嗣完全不明白她此刻能有什么好笑的。“我想我初次见面时对很多人都没好感。”

"What does _that_ mean?" Shinji threw his arms up in exasperation. "Is this about the other night? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!" Asuka's eyes snapped back onto Shinji's and her smile disappeared like a ghost.  
"那是什么意思？" 真嗣沮丧地举起双臂。"这是在说前几晚的事吗？我很抱歉，好吗？我真的感到很抱歉！" 明日香的眼神突然回到真嗣身上，她的笑容瞬间消失无踪。

"What are you apologizing for?"  
你为何要道歉？

"What do you mean?" Shinji whiped away a stray clump of snowflakes that clung to his hair.  
"你指的是什么？" 真嗣拂去了附着在头发上的几片雪花。

"Why are you sorry? Do you even know what part of what you said made me angry?" Her tone had turned openly derisive. "Or if I'm even angry at you at all? Has it ever ocurred to you that there are a million other things I could be mad about? You don't get that much under my skin, baka, don't give yourself so much credit."  
你为何要道歉？你可知道是哪句话触怒了我？" 她的话语中带着明显的嘲讽。"还是说，你根本不确定我是否真的对你生气？难道你没想过，我可能因为其他无数的事情而恼火？你并没有那么让我在意，笨蛋，别太自以为是了。

Shinji searched desperately for something to say, and found nothing at all. He shook his head, completely at a loss.  
真嗣焦急地寻找着话题，却什么也找不到。他无奈地摇了摇头，完全陷入了迷茫。

"What do you want from me, Asuka?"  
明日香，你想要我做什么？

It was the briefest of moments – just a flicker of emotion over her face. There in a flash and then gone just as quickly – so quickly in fact that Shinji was unsure at first if he had seen anything at all. In that second, for all the world to see, it looked like Asuka Langley Sohryu was going to break down and cry. Shinji felt his anger evaporate immediately.  
那一刻极其短暂——仅仅是她脸上闪过的一丝情感。它来得快去得也快，快到让真嗣起初都怀疑自己是否真的看到了什么。就在那一瞬间，全世界都看到了，明日香·兰格雷似乎就要崩溃哭泣。真嗣的怒气立刻烟消云散。

Asuka turned away from him and faced towards their home.  
明日香转过身去，面向家的方向。

"I want you to leave me alone, Shinji. Please stop talking to me."  
“真嗣，我希望你离我远点。请别再跟我说话了。”

She walked away. Shinji watched Asuka as she was swallowed up by the snow.  
她转身离去。真嗣目送着明日香的身影逐渐消失在纷飞的雪花中。

---

"It's a trap. She's going to kill you."  
这是个圈套。她打算对你下杀手。

Friday night. 周五之夜。

Kensuke lounged on Touji's bed at Suzuhara's residence. He pointed his camera at Touji, who was standing across the room, in front of his closet.  
健介慵懒地躺在铃原家的床上，将相机对准了站在房间另一头衣橱前的透治。

"Final thoughts on the night of your demise?"  
“在你生命终结之夜的最后思绪是什么？”

Touji glared at the lens.  
冬二怒视着镜头。

"Girls make no damn sense at all."  
女孩子真是让人完全搞不懂。

Kensuke laughed, clicking off the camera and placing the device next to himself on the bed. "What do you mean?"  
健介笑着关掉相机，将设备放在床边的自己身旁，问道：“你指的是什么？”

"I mean this whole... stupid... everything!" Touji looked into his mirror. Having never been on a single date in his entire life, Touji was surprised to find he was having some slight anxiety about it. Was he supposed to dress up nicely for a movie? Was that a thing?  
"我是说这一切...真是愚蠢透顶...所有的事！" 透治对着镜子自言自语。他一生从未有过约会经历，此刻却意外地感到一丝紧张。难道看电影也需要精心打扮吗？这真的有必要吗？

"You've got a date with one of the hottest girls in school, Touji. Why are you complaining? I'm jealous, honestly." Kensuke confessed, stretching. "Utterly confused, but jealous nonetheless."  
你竟然和学校里最受欢迎的女生之一约会，东治。还在抱怨什么呢？说实话，我都有些嫉妒了。" 真嗣坦白道，一边伸着懒腰。"虽然完全摸不着头脑，但嫉妒是肯定的。

"That's what I mean! Why is she doing this? Doesn't she like that Kaji guy? I thought that was why she turned everyone down." Touji angled himself towards Kensuke. "This tie is too much, right?"  
“我就是这个意思！她为什么要这么做？她不喜欢那个 Kaji 吗？我还以为她拒绝所有人是因为这个。” 冬二转向健介，“这条领带是不是太夸张了？”

Kensuke shrugged. "I don't know, man. Maybe she's given up on older men?"  
健介耸耸肩，说：“我不清楚，伙计。或许她对老男人已经没兴趣了？”

"Even so," Touji turned back to his wall, "Why in the hell would she ask me? Of all the people in the school, you know? Of all the places to start." Touji fixed his clothing and examined himself in the glass.  
“即便如此，” 冬二转身面向墙壁，“她怎么会偏偏问我呢？全校那么多人，不是吗？那么多地方可以选择。” 冬二整理好衣服，对着镜子仔细打量自己。

The tie looked... very okay.  
这条领带看起来还不错。

...okay, this was stupid. He was going to wear his jacket instead.  
...好吧，这真是愚蠢。他决定改穿夹克。

"Well, I can't argue there. Honestly, if Sohryu was going to date anyone, I would have thought she'd pick Shinji," Kensuke sighed. "But there you go."  
确实，这一点我无话可说。说真的，如果双龙要选择约会对象，我原本以为她会选真嗣，"健介叹息道，"结果却是这样。

"Our friend Shinji? Shinji Ikari? The one she's so angry at she can't even talk to?" Touji glanced at Kensuke as he took off the tie. "They fight all the time! Why would she date Shinji?"  
我们的朋友真嗣？碇真嗣？就是那个让她气到连话都不想说的？" 透治一边解开领带一边瞥了健介一眼。"他们总是吵架！她怎么会跟真嗣约会呢？

Kensuke shrugged. "He's the only guy she talks to."  
健介耸耸肩说：“她是唯一一个和他交谈的人。”

Throwing on his jacket, Touji looked into the mirror and steeled himself. No matter what was about to happen, it was just one date, right? Not really a big deal.  
冬二穿上外套，对着镜子坚定了心志。不管接下来会发生什么，不过是一次约会而已，没什么大不了的。

For some reason, Touji's thoughts briefly drifted to when Hikari had blushed earlier in the day.  
不知为何，绫人的思绪忽然飘到了白天光脸红的那一幕。

He cracked his neck. 他扭动了一下脖子。

"Okay let's do this." 好的，咱们开始吧。

---

AN: Well _this_ certainly is a strange development! What's that crazy girl up to, anyway? To be continued, of course. :)  
哎呀，这发展真是出人意料！那疯丫头又在搞什么名堂？故事当然还没结束。 :)

### Chapter 3 No One Else, part II
"Is Touji the Kansai boy?" Misato asked from Asuka's doorway, "or is he the one with glasses? Don't tell Shin-kun, but I can never keep them straight."  
‘冬二是关西男孩吗？’美里站在明日香的门口问道，‘还是那个戴眼镜的？别告诉真嗣，我总是搞不清楚他们。’

"Glasses is Kensuke, and I wouldn't touch _that_ if you paid me a million dollars." Asuka was drying her hair with a towel. "Touji is Kansai boy, yeah."  
眼镜是健介，给我一百万美元我也不会去碰。" 明日香一边用毛巾擦着头发，一边说，"斗志是关西男孩，没错。

She had just gotten out of the shower and didn't have all that much time before she was supposed to meet up with Touji. She could smell Shinji cooking in the kitchen, and was embarrassed to admit she felt a pang of hunger. Asuka would never admit it, but not eating Shinji's boxed lunches for the five days had been rough. Her cooking was awful, especially by comparison. "Could you close the door?" she asked.  
她刚沐浴完毕，距离与冬二会面时间不多。厨房里真嗣烹饪的香气飘来，她虽不愿承认，却感到一阵饥饿。明日香绝不会说出口，但连续五天不吃真嗣的便当确实让她难受。相比之下，她的厨艺实在糟糕。“你能把门关上吗？”她请求道。

Misato stepped inside, sliding the door shut behind her.  
美里走进房间，随手将门轻轻关上。

"I didn't tell you yet, but I think this is really good, Asuka. A date, that is. It makes me happy that you guys have friends outside of the work we do with the Evangelions." She sipped her beer and stepped over next to Asuka, leering. "And besides, looks like the boys are finally starting to see what a first-rate hottie you're turning into, Asuka-chan!"  
我还没来得及告诉你，但我觉得这真的很棒，明日香。约会，我是说。看到你们在工作之外还能有朋友，我感到很高兴，毕竟我们和 EVA 打交道。" 她喝了一口啤酒，走到明日香旁边，斜眼看着。"而且，看来那些男生终于开始意识到你变成了多么一流的美女，明日香酱！

Asuka rolled her eyes. Misato stood up, smiling.  
明日香不耐烦地翻了翻眼睛。美里则微笑着站起身来。

"So what's changed between you and Suzuhara-kun?"  
那么，你和铃原君之间发生了什么变化呢？

Asuka put down the towel and began to brush her hair. "What do you mean?"  
明日香放下毛巾，开始梳理头发，问道：“你指的是什么？”

"Well, to be honest, I'm not sure I ever saw you have an actual conversation with the boy whenever he was over here before." Misato plopped down onto her roomate's bed, twirling the froth at the bottom of the beer can. "And you and Shinji haven't exactly been great terms lately. I was just wondering if there was a connection, is all."  
“说真的，我不记得你和那男孩在他来这儿之前有过真正的对话。”Misato 坐到室友床上，摆弄着啤酒罐底部的泡沫。“而且你和 Shinji 最近关系挺紧张的。我只是好奇这之间有没有什么联系。”

"Shinji has nothing to do with this."  
真嗣与此事毫无关系。

"Is that so?" Misato finished the rest of the can.  
"真的吗？" 美里喝光了剩下的罐装饮料。

"YES," Asuka tore the brush through a knot in her hair. "Why can nobody seem to figure that out?"  
没错，" 明日香用力梳过头发上的一个结，抱怨道，"怎么好像谁都搞不清楚呢？

"It's just a little surprising. You and Shinji... well..." Misato sipped her drink. "You we're usually kinda close, you know? Closer than you two seemed to be with anyone else, anyway. I guess I always thought there might be something there."  
这确实有点出乎意料。你和真嗣...嗯..." 美里抿了一口饮料，接着说，"你们俩平时关系挺亲密的，不是吗？比你们对其他人都要亲近。我总觉得你们之间可能有些什么。

The pilot shot a glare at her. "The Third Child is my roommate, and nothing else. If I had wanted anything to happen with _that_ idiot I would have asked him out and that would have been the end of it!" Asuka turned back towards her desk and tossed her brush into her desk drawer, her hand angrily snatching up her sync clips and sliding them onto her head. She glared into her mirror.  
飞行员狠狠地瞪了她一眼。“第三子只是我的室友，别无其他。如果我想和那个傻瓜有什么发展，我早就主动约他了，事情也就到此为止！”明日香转身回到桌前，将刷子随手丢进抽屉，气愤地抓起同步夹，迅速戴在头上。她对着镜子，眼中闪烁着怒火。

_There. I'm cute, goddamn it.  
看吧，我真的很可爱。_

In the reflection she saw Misato, her face filled with the strangest expression of... pity? Did Misato _pity_ her? Asuka felt her temper starting to boil. _Nobody_ pitied her. Misato sighed and got to her feet.  
在倒影中，她瞥见美里，脸上带着一种奇特的表情——怜悯？美里是在同情她吗？明日香感到怒火中烧。她不需要任何人的同情。美里叹息一声，站了起来。

"Well, I'll let you get dressed," the older woman put her hand on Asuka's shoulder, and their eyes met in the mirror. "Try and have some fun tonight, okay?"  
好吧，我让你去穿衣服，"年长的女士把手放在明日香的肩上，两人在镜中对视。"今晚尽量找点乐子，好吗？

Misato gave her shoulder a little squeeze and walked out of the room, shutting the door after her.  
美里轻轻捏了一下她的肩膀，随即走出房间，顺手将门关上。

In the kitchen, Misato patted Shinji on the back and smiled at him.  
在厨房里，Misato 轻轻拍了拍 Shinji 的背，向他投以微笑。

"Dinner smells great, Shin-chan."  
晚餐闻起来真香，新之助。

---

The truth was that since she could remember, Asuka had always prided herself on her red hair. Even in Germany, where it had been significantly more commonplace than in Japan, she had worn it like a badge of honor. 'Did you know that out of all the hair colors on earth, red is the most rare?' Asuka was born marked for greatness. That was the way she saw it, anyway. She had been overjoyed when she found her Eva came in a matching color.  
实际上，自明日香记事起，她就一直为自己的红发感到自豪。即使在红发更为普遍的德国，她也将其视为一种荣耀的标志。“你知道吗，在所有地球上的发色中，红色是最为稀有的？”明日香觉得自己生来就注定不凡。至少她是这么看待自己的。当她发现自己的 Eva 也是同样的红色时，她感到非常兴奋。

Asuka liked that red was vibrant and alive. She liked that it stood out in a crowd. People noticed when Asuka walked into a room – she was hard to miss. More importantly, she was hard to forget. The German girl may not be mourned by everyone that knew her when she died, but she would never be forgotten. Books would be written about the girl genius and her exploits in Unit 02. Asuka took no little amount of pride in her constant visibility.  
明日香钟爱红色的鲜活与生机，它让她在人群中格外显眼。每当她步入房间，总能吸引众人的目光，她难以被忽视，更难以被遗忘。尽管这位德国少女离世时未必能得到所有相识者的哀悼，但她的传奇绝不会被抹去。有关这位天才少女及其在《二号机》中英勇事迹的书籍将会流传后世。明日香对自己的高辨识度深感自豪。

Which made her more than a little irritated when it took Touji five minutes to spot her after arriving at their destination.  
抵达目的地后，东治花了五分钟才找到她，这让她感到相当不悦。

"Sorry, Sohryu. Didn't recognize you out of uniform."  
“抱歉，长门。没认出你穿便装的样子。”

Asuka fumed. 明日香气得直冒烟。

"Let's just get to this stupid movie."  
咱们直接去看那部无聊的电影吧。

---

The movie was an old American horror film from before the Second Impact, which Asuka had chosen on a whim. It had been a while since she'd practiced her English, anyway. Touji, for his part, didn't seem thrilled at the prospect of having to read subtitles, but didn't make any vocal complaints.  
这部电影是一部来自第二次冲击之前的美国老恐怖片，是明日香一时兴起选的。不管怎样，她已经有一段时间没有练习英语了。至于真嗣，他似乎对不得不看字幕的前景并不感到兴奋，但没有发出任何抱怨。

The main character was a Siamese twin who had been traumatically (surgically) separated from her sister as a child. The twin sister had died in the operation, and now the sister's personality lived on inside of the main girl, a woman now in her twenties. Asuka found it really very hard to believe this could actually happen, but was willing to accept it for an hour and a half because she had paid for two tickets to see it. And after all, Asuka fought aliens in a giant robot and shared an apartment with a semi-sentient penguin. The world was a strange and wondrous place.  
故事的主角是一位暹罗双胞胎之一，她们在幼年时经历了创伤性的手术分离。手术中，她的双胞胎姐妹不幸去世，而姐姐的个性却奇迹般地留在了主角的内心，如今她已是一位二十多岁的女性。Asuka 虽然觉得这一切难以置信，但为了那一个半小时的电影体验，她愿意暂时接受这个设定，毕竟她已经为此买了两张票。再说，Asuka 曾在巨型机器人中与外星人战斗，并与一只半智能的企鹅同住一室，这个世界本就是充满了奇异与惊喜。

Throughout the movie, the main girl would try and start relationships with people (including a handsome young black man), all of which would inevitably end in violent confrontation when her latent personality emerged. Asuka had read somewhere that horror films were just 'heightened drama' – that inherently all horror movies were not necessarily scary, but tragic. The tragedy of this movie was, of course, that the one side of the main character truly and deeply loved the black man, but she would never be able to be with him because everytime she got close, her sister showed up and ruined everything. Or, really because of her psychological disorder that manifested as her sister half, because Asuka was _really_ having trouble believing that the dead sister could somehow periodically inhabit her body. That literally made no sense at all.  
电影全程，女主角不断尝试与他人（包括一位英俊的黑人青年）建立情感联系，然而每当她隐藏的性格暴露时，这些关系总会以暴力冲突收场。Asuka 曾听说，恐怖片不过是“戏剧的放大”——本质上，这些电影不一定旨在吓人，而是充满了悲剧色彩。这部电影的悲剧核心在于，女主角内心深处真挚地爱着那位黑人男子，却注定无法与他相守，因为每次她试图靠近，她的姐姐便会出现，破坏一切美好。 或许，真正的原因在于她心理障碍的表现形式，即她姐姐的半身。因为明日香实在难以相信，已故的姐姐竟能以某种方式周期性地占据她的身体，这种说法简直毫无逻辑可言。

The point was, part of this girl cared for the man, and part of her despised him, but she couldn't overcome her childhood trauma. The two personalities would clash and eventually the only solution they could come up with was to-  
关键在于，这个女孩内心的一部分对那个男人怀有关心，另一部分则对他充满鄙夷，然而她无法摆脱童年阴影的影响。这两种截然不同的情感不断碰撞，最终他们只能想到一个解决办法——

_Whatever, this movie is stupid.  
总之，这部电影真是愚蠢。_

They all died at the end. Very tragic. Thank god that's over.  
他们最终都离世了，实在令人痛心。幸好这一切终于过去了。

After the credits rolled, Asuka practically ran out of the theater, Touji right behind her.  
片尾字幕一结束，明日香就急匆匆地跑出了电影院，真嗣紧跟在她后面。

"That sucked," Touji muttered.  
“真是糟透了，” 冬二低声抱怨。

"I feel a whole lot stupider," Asuka agreed.  
"我觉得自己真是蠢到家了，"明日香附和道。

Until very recently, she and Shinji would often spend Saturday mornings watching whatever movie was airing on the television. Every once in a while, when the movie was really awful, they would watch it anyway, pointing out all the terrible dialogue and all of the bad acting for each other. They would quip over the movie and try and to crack each other up. She would never admit to it, but on those mornings Asuka often found herself laughing with Shinji – truly enjoying his company. The first morning they had done this, she remembered being surprised that her fellow pilot could actually be funny when he loosened up.  
不久前，她和真嗣还常在周六上午一起看电视台播放的任何电影。有时电影实在糟糕，他们仍会观看，互相指出那些糟糕的台词和演技。他们会互相调侃，试图逗乐对方。虽然她从不承认，但在那些早晨，明日香发现自己常与真嗣一同欢笑，真心享受他的陪伴。她记得第一次这样时，她惊讶地发现，当真嗣放松时，他其实很有趣。

Watching television with other people was not something she much did back home. Between the studying and training for the Evangelion program, Asuka hadn't had much time for a social life. There was also the nearly ten-year age difference between her and her former peers. They had all had such awful taste in entertainment.  
在家时，她很少与他人一同看电视。忙于学习和使徒计划的训练，明日香几乎没有社交时间。而且，她与曾经的同龄人之间有着近十年的年龄差距，他们对娱乐的品味实在不敢恭维。

Asuka wondered briefly what Shinji would have said about the movie she just walked out of. She thought of how he smiled when he laughed.  
明日香思索片刻，想知道真嗣会对她刚离开的那部电影有何评价。她回忆起他笑起来时那温暖的微笑。

"_...do you hate me?"_ ...你是不是讨厌我？

"_You know, Asuka? Sometimes I really do."_  
“你知道吗，明日香？有时候我确实是这样。”

She looked over in time to see Touji yawning hugely.  
她恰好转头，正好看到冬二在打一个大哈欠。

"So what now, Sohryu?" he put his arms behind his head and turned towards her. Looks like she was running this date after all. "You want to just go home?"  
那么，苏里，接下来怎么办？" 他双手枕在脑后，转头看向她。似乎这场约会还是由她来掌控。"你想现在就回家吗？

"No," she responded immediately. "Not yet. Let's get something to eat. I'm starving."  
不，" 她立即回应道，"还没呢。我们先去吃点东西吧，我饿得不行了。

---

Shinji stood on the balcony outside of his room. Kaji had come over for dinner, and after they had all eaten, he and Misato had retired to her bedroom, prompting Shinji to do the same in his, though probably with drastically different results after the door shut. Shinji didn't know for sure. He put on his SDAT player and stared out at Tokyo-3.  
真嗣站在自己房间外的阳台上。加持来家里共进晚餐，饭后他和美里各自回房，真嗣也回到自己的房间，但关门后的情形可能大相径庭。真嗣并不确定。他戴上 SDAT 播放器，凝望着第三新东京市的夜景。

Kaji spent the night every once in a while, and honestly it didn't bother Shinji that much. He was happy that Misato had someone she could be with – that she could talk to. Shinji felt sometimes that there was more she wanted to say to the pilots but didn't. Maybe it was because she was technically their boss, maybe because they were so much younger. Either way, there were those moments when a look of infinite sadness would pass over Misato's face, and Shinji knew there was something she was thinking and would never tell him about. He knew she shared a lot more with Kaji than she did with him, and that made him happy for her.  
卡吉偶尔会在晚上过来，这其实并没有让真嗣感到困扰。他很高兴美里能有个人陪伴，能和她谈心。真嗣有时觉得美里想对驾驶员们说更多，但出于种种原因没有说出口，可能是她作为上司的身份，也可能是他们年龄差距较大。每当这种时候，美里的脸上总会闪过一丝无尽的悲伤，真嗣明白她心中有事，却永远不会向他透露。他知道美里和卡吉之间有着更多的交流，这让他为美里感到欣慰。

As long as he didn't have to hear how happy she was. Hence the tape player. Shinji stopped the tape and took off his earphones. They were probably done, anyway.  
只要他不必听到她有多快乐，就有了磁带播放器。真嗣停下磁带，摘下耳机，他们大概已经结束了。

Just as he did so, the door behind him opened.  
就在他这么做的时候，他背后的门开了。

"Hey there, Shinji-kun," Kaji took out a cigarette as he stepped out to join the pilot. "How's the night?"  
嘿，真嗣，" 加持一边掏出香烟，一边走出来与飞行员会合。"今晚过得如何？

"Hello, Kaji-san. A little cold, I guess." Shinji smiled. "It's winter though, so I guess it's to be expected."  
你好，加治先生。感觉有点冷，我想。" 真嗣笑了笑，"毕竟是冬天，这也是正常的。

Kaji held up the cigarette and looked at the boy. "Do you mind? I could wait until later if it bothers you."  
卡吉举起手中的香烟，目光转向男孩。“介意我抽吗？如果这让你不舒服，我可以稍后再抽。”

"No, of course not. Please continue."  
不，当然不是。请继续说。

"Thanks," Kaji lit up. He sighed as he leaned on the banister. After a moment, he took out his cigarette and spoke. "So, Asuka's out on a date, huh?"  
谢谢，" 卡吉脸上露出了笑容。他叹息一声，倚靠在栏杆上。片刻后，他掏出香烟，开口道："这么说，明日香是去约会了，对吧？

"Yeah, I guess so." 嗯，我想应该是这样。

Kaji nodded contemplatively as he blew out a plume of smoke. "Well, that's wonderful for her. She's a good kid." He glanced over at Shinji. "A little bit... _loud_ sometimes, but she's got a good heart, I think."  
加治若有所思地点头，吐出一缕烟雾。“嗯，这对她来说是件好事。她是个好孩子。”他瞥了一眼真嗣。“虽然有时有点吵闹，但我觉得她心地善良。”

"Well, she's certainly loud," Shinji shivered.  
“哎，她真是吵闹，”真嗣颤抖着说道。

"Oh, come on. Asuka-chan's not all that bad." Kaji turned around, so he was facing the doorway. "You know that, Shinji-kun."  
哎，别这样。明日香其实没那么差劲。" 加持转过身，面向门口。"你心里有数的，真嗣。

He sighed. "Yeah, I know... That doesn't stop her from occasionally being the most irritating person on earth."  
他叹了口气，说道：“没错，我知道……但她偶尔还是会成为世界上最让人受不了的人。”

Kaji smirked. "Welcome to women, Shinji."  
加治嘴角轻扬，说道：“欢迎加入女子组，真嗣。”

Shinji shook his head. "Kaji-san, you lived with Asuka?"  
真嗣摇摇头，问道：“加持先生，您和明日香同居过吗？”

"For quite a while, yes." Kaji inhaled on his cigarette. "I know more about Sohryu than she's probably comfortable with admitting."  
确实有一段时间了。" 凯吉吸了一口烟，说道，"我对 So hryu 的了解，恐怕比她愿意承认的还要深入。

"Then why does she..." Shinji stopped.  
"那么，她为什么……" 真嗣突然停住了。

Asuka's past in front of him like an open book. What exactly did he want to ask?  
明日香的过去如同一本翻开的书，展现在他面前。他究竟想问些什么呢？

_Why does she always have to be the center of attention? Why does she always have to be the best at everyhing? Why does she wear the sync-clips all the time? Does she really think that impresses anyone? Why does she stay up until two every night? Is that a college thing? What's she DOING then, anyway? What did I do to make her angry in the first place?  
她为何总要成为众人瞩目的中心？为何每件事都要力争最佳？为何总是佩戴着同步夹？她真以为这样能给人留下深刻印象吗？为何每晚都要熬到凌晨两点？这是大学生活的常态吗？那时她究竟在忙些什么？我最初究竟做了什么惹她生气？_

_And why does she look so cute when she's angry?  
她生气时为何显得如此可爱？_

Kaji raised an eyebrow, waiting for the second half of Shinji's sentence, but the boy's thoughts had completely derailed. Shinji was frozen.  
加治扬起眉毛，等待真嗣说完后半句，然而男孩的思绪已经完全跑偏。真嗣愣在原地，一动不动。

"Um..." 呃...

_Has she always made that adorable noise when she stretches? Was she the most beautiful girl at her last school, too? Has she ever liked anyone her own age? How could they tell? Were there signs or anything?  
她每次伸展时都会发出那种可爱的声音吗？她在之前的学校也是最漂亮的女孩吗？她有没有喜欢过同龄人呢？他们是怎么看出来的？有没有什么迹象呢？_

_Why does it bother me so much that she didn't talk to me about Touji?  
她为何从未和我提及东治，这让我感到非常困扰？_

Shinji shook his head, trying to clear his brain.  
真嗣摇摇头，试图让自己的头脑清醒一些。

"Sorry, what I wanted to ask was-"  
“抱歉，我其实是想问——”

"Let me say something first, Shinji-kun." Kaji held up his hand and turned to face the pilot. Shinji shut his mouth and looked up at the older man. "Do you know what the most crucial aspect of any relationship is?"  
让我先说几句，真嗣君。" 加持举起手，转向飞行员。真嗣闭上嘴，抬头望向这位年长者。"你知道在任何关系中，最关键的是什么吗？

Shinji blushed slightly. "Uh..." He had no idea at all.  
真嗣的脸颊微微泛红，支吾着说：“呃……”他对此一无所知。

"I know you're new to this whole thing. Take a guess."  
我明白你是初次接触这些，不妨猜一猜。

Shinji racked his brain, eventually shrugging. "Mutual interests?" Kaji shook his head, smiling.  
真嗣苦思冥想，最后耸了耸肩。“共同的兴趣吗？”加持笑着摇了摇头。

"See, that's the obvious answer. A lot of people think you've got to like the same things, and that's important of course, but here's the truth," Kaji tossed his cigarette off into the abyss and put a hand on Shinji's shoulder. "The truth is that the single most important ingredient to bring two people together is _timing_."  
你看，这是很明显的答案。很多人以为双方必须有共同的爱好，这固然重要，但真相是，"卡吉将烟蒂抛向远方，一手搭在真嗣肩上。"真正最关键的，是两个人相遇的时机。

Shinji furrowed his eyebrows.  
真嗣皱眉。

"When I met Katsuragi in college, the reason we became a couple was because she was single and I was single. Well," Kaji looked up, trying to simplify the story. "I mean, there was more to it than that, but my point is we were in the right place at the right time. We had both dated people, we had both been hurt by the Second Impact and we were seeking out other people who had. Not consciously, of course, but I think that's what we were looking for. There were many floating around at the time. Wasn't hard to find broken people around then. I suppose it still isn't."  
在大学初次遇见葛城时，我们之所以成为情侣，是因为她单身，我也单身。嗯，" 加持抬头，试图简化故事。"我的意思是，这背后还有更多原因，但关键是我们在正确的时间出现在正确的地点。我们都曾约会过别人，我们都因第二次冲击而受伤，并且我们都在寻找经历过这些的人。当然，并非有意识地，但我认为这就是我们在寻找的。那时周围有很多这样的人。那时不难找到受伤的人。我想现在也不难。

He leaned back, letting Shinji process the information. "I actually came very close to spending that exact time in Australia. What if I had disappeared to Sydney instead?" He shrugged. "I never would have met Misato. Probably would have dated someone else who'd lost their family in the disaster. I never would have met Asuka-chan in Germany, and I never would have been here talking to you." Kaji smiled at the prospect. "Who knows? I might have had some Australian kids crawling on my lap at this very moment."  
他向后一靠，让真嗣有时间消化这些信息。“我差点就在澳大利亚度过了那段时间。如果我当时去了悉尼，结果会怎样呢？”他耸耸肩。“那样我就不会遇到美里。可能会和另一个在灾难中失去家人的人约会。我也不会在德国遇到明日香，更不会在这里和你交谈。”加持笑着想象着另一种可能。“谁知道呢？也许此刻我正有澳大利亚的孩子在我膝上玩耍。”

Shinji wasn't sure he followed. "So... what you're saying is...?"  
真嗣不太确定自己是否跟上了思路。“那么...你的意思是...？”

"What I'm saying is that you're very lucky to have a remarkable young lady like Sohryu sharing an apartment with you, and you're lucky to share a friendship with her. Asuka-chan doesn't open her heart to many people, Shinji-kun. If she's opened it even _slightly_ for you, then you can count yourself in the company of maybe four other people in the world." Shinji met Kaji's gaze. "But no door stays open forever."  
我想说的是，你能与 Sohryu 这样杰出的年轻女士合租公寓，并成为她的朋友，实在是幸运至极。Asuka-chan 很少对人敞开心扉，Shinji-kun。如果她对你有哪怕一丝的开放，那你就是世界上极少数能走进她内心的人之一。" Shinji 与 Kaji 对视了一眼。"然而，没有哪扇心门会永远敞开。

Kaji pushed off from the rail and stretched out his neck. "Of course, if they shut it just means other doors open, too." He looked right at Shinji and winked. "Timing."  
卡吉从栏杆上推开，伸长了脖子，说道：“当然，如果他们关闭了，也意味着其他门会打开。”他直视着真嗣，眨了眨眼，强调道：“关键在于时机。”

Kaji reached over and ruffled Shinji's hair. "See ya, Shinji-kun. Don't catch a cold."  
卡吉伸手揉了揉真嗣的头发，说道：“再见，真嗣。别着凉了。”

The older man walked off of the balcony and shut the door behind him.  
那位长者从阳台走下来，顺手关上了身后的门。

Back in Misato's room, Kaji took off his clothing and laid back down beside the woman he loved. She glanced over at him, yawning.  
回到美里的房间，加持脱去衣物，躺在了他心爱的女人身旁。她转头看了看他，打了个哈欠。

"You fall asleep?" he asked.  
“你睡着了吗？”他问道。

She nodded. "Mmm. Sorry."  
她点头示意，轻声说：“嗯，对不起。”

"Dream about anything?" 做了什么梦吗？

"Not really." Misato lay her head on Kaji's chest and listened to his heart beating. "It was cold without you. I'm glad you're back."  
并不是那样。" 美里将头倚在加持的胸前，聆听着他的心跳声。"你不在的时候，感觉很冷清。现在你回来了，真好。

Kaji smiled and closed his eyes.  
卡吉面带微笑，轻轻闭上了双眼。

"Me too." 我也是。

Dinner had been long and boring, filled to the brim with awkward silences. Asuka had absolutely nothing in common with Touji, save a mutual friend or two, and discussion of their shared movie had died out quickly.  
那顿晚餐既漫长又乏味，充斥着尴尬的沉默。明日香和冬二除了有几个共同的朋友外，几乎没有共同话题，就连他们一起看的电影讨论也很快冷场了。

This lack of any mutual interests, of course, had made him the perfect candidate.  
正是这种毫无共同利益的特点，使他成为了理想的候选人。

Asuka led the way up the hill, with Touji struggling behind. Luckily, there was no snow tonight, but the wind had started to bite at Asuka's exposed face. Japan could be really, _really_ cold. Who knew?  
明日香领头攀上山丘，冬二则在后面吃力地跟着。幸好今晚没有下雪，不过风已经开始刺痛明日香露在外面的脸。日本的寒冷真是超乎想象，谁能预料到呢？

"Hey, Sohryu, not that I'm not having a total blast here," Touji called up, "but why the hell are we hiking to the top of this hill?"  
嘿，Sohryu，我并不是说在这里玩得不开心，" 透司喊道，"但我们究竟为什么要徒步爬上这座山丘的顶端呢？

Asuka ground her teeth and turned around. "Just trust me on this! Last thing, then we can go home."  
明日香咬紧牙关，转过身来。“这件事就相信我吧！再坚持一下，我们就能回家了。”

"But what's with the hill? What's up there?" Touji stood his ground about ten feet below her. "Isn't it just a pull-off for cars? I thought there was just a rest stop?"  
“那座山丘是怎么回事？上面有什么东西吗？” 冬二站在她下方约十英尺处，问道。“那不就是个供车辆临时停靠的地方吗？我以为只是个休息站而已。”

Asuka clenched her fists. "Just. Follow. Me." It was a threat. She turned around and marched up the last third of the road, Touji panting in her wake.  
明日香紧握双拳，语气强硬：“只管跟着我。”她转身，大步走向路的最后一段，真嗣在她身后气喘吁吁地跟着。

At the top of the hill was indeed a pull-off, and Asuka was relieved to find it completely deserted. Stepping out to the ledge, one could look out across the all of Tokyo-3, and could see the entire city lit up like fireflies (save for the dark patch in the northeast corner, the appearance of which had been foretold by TV stations for the past few weeks). Asuka looked across her home and inhaled deeply. It was truly beautiful. Kaji had taken her here the night of her arrival in Japan, and the view had taken the pilot's breath away. Asuka had chosen this exact spot in her mind for imagined liaisons with Kaji on several occasions, and it had never looked more romantic. No one on earth could have staked out a better spot. Pity about the cold and everything, but Asuka had chosen well. A smile spread across her face. Perfect candidate, perfect spot: this was going to work.  
山顶确实有一个停车处，看到它空无一人，明日香感到宽慰。她走到悬崖边，可以俯瞰整个第三新东京市，整座城市灯火辉煌，宛如萤火虫般闪烁（除了东北角的一片黑暗，电视台几周前就预告了它的出现）。明日香环视着自己的家园，深吸一口气。这景色真是美不胜收。加持在她初到日本的那晚带她来过这里，那时的景象令她惊叹。明日香曾在心中多次想象与加持在此幽会，从未有过比此刻更浪漫的景象。世界上没有人能找到比这更好的地点。尽管天气寒冷，但明日香选得恰到好处。 她的脸上洋溢着笑容。候选人无可挑剔，位置也恰到好处：一切都将顺利进行。

_Please let this work.  希望这次能成功。_

Touji struggled and gasped his way up to the rest stop. His breath came out in short gasps, making speech difficult. "I'm not – taking – another step – until you tell me – why I'm here – Sohryu!" Asuka's proud moment disintegrated.  
冬二艰难地喘息着，一路挣扎到休息站。他的呼吸急促，说话都显得吃力。“我不——再走——一步——直到你告诉我——我为什么在这里——惣流！”明日香骄傲的神情瞬间瓦解。

"Mein Gott, du bist träge..." she muttered as she walked back towards Touji. She grabbed his hand and dragged him over to where both of them could see the city clearly.  
"天哪，你真是懒得可以..." 她低声抱怨着，拉着冬二的手，走到一个两人都能清晰俯瞰城市的位置。

"Wh-what did – you just say?" Touji asked, still winded. He got paranoid whenever she started speaking German around him. He always assumed it was something disparaging.  
"什-什么？你刚说什么了？" 透治喘着气问道。每当她在他周围说德语时，他就会感到不安，总觉得那是在说些贬低他的话。

"I said 'Look out at the city.'" Asuka pointed proudly. "What do you think? Isn't it a great view?"  
我说：‘看看外面的城市。’明日香自豪地指向那里，问道：‘你觉得如何？这景色是不是很壮观？’

Touji did as she suggested. The effect was largely lost on him, due to respiratory distress. He decided he should really start exercising more. The boy shrugged, finally catching his breath.  
透司依照她的建议行事，但由于呼吸不畅，效果大为减弱。他意识到自己确实需要增加锻炼。男孩耸了耸肩，终于缓过气来。

"Yeah, it's alright..." Something dawned on him. "Hold on a second, that's not the only reason I had to walk all the way up this damn hill, is it? Because, I mean, it's _swell_ and all but-"  
嗯，还凑合……" 他突然意识到。"等一下，我爬上这个讨厌的山坡不只因为这个原因吧？虽然这确实不错，但是——

"Will you just be patient?" Asuka yelled. Touji stopped talking. She let out a monstrous sigh and looked him right in the eyes.  
"你能稍微耐心一点吗？" 明日香大声说道。筒治随即闭上了嘴。她深深地叹了口气，直直地盯着他的眼睛。

"Tonight has been awful," she began. Touji found no reason to argue the point. "I hated that stupid movie, dinner was terrible, and everything pretty much sucked. We honestly gave it a shot, but this date is a failure. I don't like you."  
今晚真是糟透了，"她开口说道。东治觉得没有理由反驳。"那部电影太无聊了，晚餐也难以下咽，几乎所有事情都让人失望。我们确实努力了，但这次约会还是搞砸了。我对你没感觉。

"Good. I don't like you, either."  
好吧，我也不喜欢你。

"I mean, I really have no feelings for you at all. You're no different from anyone else that I don't have feelings for."  
说实话，我对你真的没有感觉，你和其他我不在意的人没什么两样。

"Glad we got that all sorted out. I'm going home."  
很高兴我们把事情都理顺了。我现在要回家了。

"So, this should feel exactly like it did when I kissed him."  
“因此，这种感觉应该和我吻他时完全相同。”

"Wait, wha-?" 等等，什么？

Asuka grabbed Touji's face and pressed their lips together.  
明日香抓住冬二的脸颊，深深地吻了上去。

Positives: it was warm. His shocked yell was significantly muffled.  
好处是天气暖和，他的惊叫声也因此变得低沉许多。

Negatives: everything else imaginable.  
负面事物：所有其他可想象的东西。

This felt all wrong. It was wet and clumsy and enormously...vacant. Asuka had only kissed one other person before in her life, and you really needed a comparison, you know? Maybe _all_ kissing felt like that? Maybe it was all that rush and flutter every time you kissed anyone, regardless of who it was?  
这感觉完全不对劲。吻得湿漉漉的，笨拙至极，还异常空洞。明日香这辈子只吻过另一个人，确实需要一个比较才能明白。或许所有的吻都是这样？也许每次接吻都会有那种冲动和悸动，不论对方是谁？

Asuka closed her eyes and desperately tried to summon up any sort of spark between them. _It's the same. It feels just like he did. I swear._  
明日香闭上双眼，竭力想要在他们之间点燃哪怕一丝火花。这种感觉，和他那时如出一辙。我敢肯定。

She pulled Touji as close to her as possible, even venturing her tongue into his mouth briefly. His arms eventually stopped flailing in protest.  
她紧紧地将 Touji 拥入怀中，甚至大胆地用舌头轻触他的唇间。不久，他的手臂也停止了挣扎。

After what seemed like forever, the kiss ended and both teenagers stood uncomfortably in front of each other.  
似乎过了很久，这个吻才结束，两个青少年面对面站着，显得有些不自在。

Silence. 静默无声。

"Never, **_EVER_** do that again."  
绝对不要再做那样的事了。

"I never will. Let's not tell anyone this happened."  
我绝不会说出去。这件事我们谁也别告诉。

"See you Monday, Sohryu." Touji turned and started back down the hill.  
"周一见，惣流。" 透治说完便转身下山。

Asuka turned and walked to the edge, looking out over the city that had become her home. She smiled triumphantly, wiping her mouth with the back of her jacket sleeve.  
明日香转身走向边缘，俯瞰着这座已成为她家的城市。她得意地笑了，用夹克袖子擦了擦嘴。

_Well, that was terrible. Mission accomplished. It felt just like Shinji did. I don't care about him. He doesn't matter. He can't touch me. I'm in front of the pack looking back, where I should be.  
唉，真是糟糕至极。任务总算完成了。感觉就像真嗣那样。我对他毫不在意。他无足轻重。他无法触及我。我站在队伍最前方，回望身后，这才是我应有的位置。_

_He can't hurt me at all.  
他完全无法伤害我。_

The wind howled '_Liar'._ 风声呼啸，仿佛在喊“骗子”。

Asuka's smile crumbled. She pulled her coat tighter and felt her eyes start to fill with tears.  
明日香的笑容瞬间消失。她紧紧裹住外套，泪水开始在眼眶中涌动。

It felt like it had been forever since she'd cried that hard.  
仿佛自从她上次哭得如此撕心裂肺之后，时间已流逝许久。

---

_AN: Oh, Asuka-chan, here we go again. People seem to hurt each other so often in this world. *sighs*  
AN：哎，明日香，又是一样的情况。这世界里，人们总是频繁地彼此伤害。*叹息*_

_Thank you all very much for the kind feedback. I must also apologize for any time lapse in between updates. Work has been picking up recently, of the good-but-busy-making variety, so it may be a week or two before the next chapter. Hopefully sooner rather than later, but please let me know if you're planning on continuing reading/how I'm driving and all that. It's the reviews that keep you going, you know? :)  
衷心感谢各位的善意反馈。同时，我也为更新之间的任何延迟表示歉意。近期工作确实繁忙，属于那种既充实又忙碌的类型，因此可能需要一到两周时间才能发布新章节。希望能尽快，但也请告知你们是否继续关注/我的表现如何等。毕竟，正是这些评论激励我们不断前行，不是吗？ :)_

_Cheers, everyone. Stay safe and warm.  
大家保重，注意安全和保暖。_

### Chapter 4 Under Cover of Darkness
The cold night wind had quickly given way to snow, which had twisted into sleet and then eventually a cold, driving rain. Thunder boomed overhead as Asuka pulled her jacket tighter.  
寒夜的冷风迅速转变成了雪花，随后又化作冻雨，最终演变成一场寒冷而猛烈的降雨。阿斯卡紧了紧外套，此时雷声在头顶轰鸣。

She wouldn't go home to the apartment tonight. She couldn't. Asuka felt like a hole had been punched through her gut, and returning to Misato's place would just be salting the wound. She clenched her fists. It must be past midnight. She wondered if anyone was worried yet.  
她今晚不打算回公寓。她做不到。明日香感到仿佛腹部被穿了个洞，回到美里家只会让伤口更痛。她紧握双拳，心想现在肯定已过午夜，不知道是否已经有人开始担心她了。

A gust of wind slapped rain across her cheeks and Asuka realized she was shivering almost uncontrollably. _How long that had been happening?_  
一阵疾风将雨水猛烈地拍打到她的脸颊上，明日香这才意识到自己正不由自主地颤抖。这种情况已经持续多久了呢？

Looking around herself, Asuka realized she also had very little idea of where in the city she actually was. The buildings were alien to her, and their lights danced garishly off of every wet surface. She wouldn't ask for directions, though. Asking directions meant admitting you were lost. She bit back the tears she felt forming in her eyes again. It's not like she had a destination, anyway.  
明日香环顾四周，发现自己对身处城市的具体位置几乎一无所知。周围的建筑对她来说十分陌生，灯光在潮湿的表面上闪烁，显得格外刺眼。然而，她并不打算问路，因为那意味着承认自己迷失了方向。她努力抑制住再次涌上眼眶的泪水，毕竟，她并没有明确的目的地。

_It couldn't be true. It wasn't true. Not for him. I haven't fallen for-  
这不可能真实。这不是事实。对他而言并非如此。我并未陷入——_

"Asuka?" 飞鸟？

The pilot's head snapped up at the sound of her name and she found herself face to face with Hikari Horaki. The class representative stood dumbfounded, holding an umbrella, shocked. Asuka felt her head starting to spin. Everything was so numb in the cold that she felt warm.  
听到自己的名字，飞行员猛然抬头，迎面撞上了 Hikari Horaki。班长愣在原地，手中紧握着伞，一脸震惊。Asuka 感到一阵眩晕袭来，在这寒冷中，一切都显得麻木，她却意外地感到一丝温暖。

"Asuka-chan, what're you doing out like this? Where's Suzuhara-?"  
明日香，你怎么会在这里？铃原去哪儿了？

Asuka's knees wobbled and the world fell out from under her.  
明日香的膝盖颤抖不已，仿佛整个世界都从她脚下崩塌。

---

_It was a carnival, and Asuka was in her favorite summer dress – the white one with the red trim. She tapped her foot impatiently.  
那是一个嘉年华，明日香身着她最爱的夏装——那件白底红边的裙子。她焦急地用脚轻敲着地面。_

"_That idiot better get here soon..." she mumbled, checking her watch._  
“那家伙最好快点到，别磨蹭了……”她低声抱怨，不时瞥一眼手表。

_And before she knew it, there he was. He had Kaji's eyes and her Father's broad shoulders to be sure, but it was Shinji. Her Baka-Shinji. He apologized for keeping her waiting and she was so happy to see him she didn't even hear the words.  
在她还没反应过来时，他已经站在那里了。他的眼睛像 Kaji，肩膀则像她父亲一样宽阔，但那确实是真嗣，她的傻瓜真嗣。他因让她久等而道歉，她见到他高兴得连他说什么都听不进去了。_

_With a surge of courage, Asuka laced her fingers through his and smiled. It felt good to not lie. They were in public and everyone could see them, even the Father, The Son, and the Holy Fool, all three in a row, but she didn't care. Asuka waved her hand and as her wrist flicked all the weight lifted from her shoulders.  
鼓起勇气，Asuka 紧握他的手，微笑着。不再说谎的感觉真好。他们身处公共场所，所有人都能看到他们，包括圣父、圣子和圣愚，三人并排，但她毫不在意。Asuka 挥手间，手腕轻扬，肩上的重担仿佛瞬间消失。_

_Just like that she was free.  
就这样，她获得了自由。_

_She had wings. She felt young. Asuka hadn't felt young in_ _**years**__. Young people didn't go to college before adolescence, or fight Angels. Young people fell head over heels in 'like' with each other and then held hands to let the whole world know who they belonged to._  
她拥有翅膀，感觉自己年轻了。明日香已经很久没有这种年轻的感觉了。年轻人在青春期之前不会上大学，也不会与使徒战斗。年轻人会深深地喜欢上对方，然后牵手向全世界宣告他们属于彼此。

_Shinji turned towards her. "If you've got wings, you should use them," he remarked. He looked so handsome and mature with half of Kaji's face. "Would you like to ride the Ferris wheel?"  
真嗣转向她，说道：“既然你有翅膀，就该展翅飞翔。”他那半张加持的面容，显得格外英俊成熟。“要不要一起去坐摩天轮？”_

_Asuka skipped. "Take me anywhere," she breathed, "I want to be your world."  
明日香轻盈地跳起。“带我去任何地方吧，”她轻声细语，“我愿成为你的整个世界。”_

"_Love will destroy us all," he told her. She knew it was true._  
“爱情终将毁灭我们，”他对她说。她深知此言不虚。

_She squeezed his hand and discovered they were her Mother's hands.  
她紧紧握住那双手，惊讶地发现那竟是她母亲的手。_

_That was when Asuka realized the rope had been around her neck the whole time. She felt it constrict and suddenly she couldn't breathe at all. The noose pulled her to the ground and dragged her into the House of Mirrors kicking and screaming and begging for help that wouldn't come.  
那一刻，明日香才意识到绳索一直勒在她的脖子上。随着绳索的收紧，她突然间无法呼吸。绳索将她拽倒在地，拖进镜子屋，她一边挣扎一边尖叫，呼救却无人前来。_

---

Asuka woke with a start to an unfamiliar ceiling, or rather: one she didn't immediately recognize. After all, Hikari's house was not the place she had expected to open her eyes. Sunlight cascaded through the class rep's window, illuminating every inch of the room. Asuka sat up in Hikari's bed, lazily looking around for her friend.  
明日香突然惊醒，眼前是一个陌生的天花板，准确来说，是一个她一时没认出来的天花板。毕竟，光的家并非她预料中醒来之地。阳光透过班代表的窗户洒满整个房间。明日香坐在光的床上，慵懒地四处张望，寻找她的朋友。

Hikari walked into the room already dressed, carrying a pot of tea and a cup.  
光已经穿戴整齐，手里提着一壶茶和一个杯子，走进了房间。

"Good morning!" She chirped, brightly. Asuka yawned, her reply less enthusiastic, and with decidedly less consonants. Hikari didn't mention it. "How'd you sleep?"  
早上好！" 她欢快地叫道。明日香打了个哈欠，回答得不那么热情，辅音也少了些。光没有提及这一点。"你睡得怎么样？

"Terribly. I had bad dreams I think." Asuka mumbled. "I don't remember them." Her head felt gigantic. She rubbed her face, noticing for the first time that she was in her underwear. "Why am I naked?"  
非常糟糕。我想我做了噩梦。" 明日香喃喃自语，"我不记得了。" 她的头感觉异常沉重。她揉了揉脸，这才意识到自己只穿着内衣。"我怎么是裸着的？

"I'm sorry, Asuka-chan." Hikari said, pouring her some tea. "I washed and dried your clothes. Is that okay?" She held the cup out to Asuka, her face apologetic. The German smiled, accepting the cup.  
"对不起，明日香。" 光边说边为她倒茶。"我已经洗好并烘干了你的衣服，这样可以吗？" 她递过杯子，脸上带着歉意。明日香微笑着接过茶杯。

"Of course that's okay, Hikari." Asuka sipped from the cup. The warmth from the liquid filled her chest. "Where'd you sleep?"  
当然可以，光。" 明日香啜饮着杯中的液体，暖意涌入心间。"你昨晚睡在哪儿？

"On the couch. I already called Katsuragi-san and let her know you spent the night here." Hikari felt Asuka's forehead. "You felt feverish, so I figured you needed the blankets. You feel a lot better now, though." She stood up, concerned. "What were you doing outside that late? Why didn't you have an umbrella? Where was Suzuhara-kun?"  
你躺在沙发上。我已经联系了桂木小姐，让她知道你在这里过夜。" 光轻轻摸了摸明日香的额头。"你之前有点发烧，我想你需要盖毯子。现在看起来好多了。" 她站起身，关切地问："那么晚了，你为什么还在外面？怎么没带伞呢？铃原君又在哪里？

Asuka let out a long sigh, falling back onto the pillow. It was so much softer than her bed in the other apartment. "It didn't go well."  
明日香深深叹了口气，躺回枕头上。这里的枕头比她在另一个公寓的床要柔软许多。“事情进展得并不顺利。”

Hikari looked mortified. "...what happened? Did he... try to...?" Her face flushed red.  
光显得十分惊慌。“……到底怎么了？他……难道想……？”她的脸颊顿时红透了。

"No! God, nothing like that, don't worry." Asuka laughed at the idea. "Nothing happened. That was the problem. I had no idea someone so loud could be so boring."  
不！天哪，不是那样的，别担心。" 明日香对这个想法笑了笑。"什么都没发生。这就是问题所在。我没想到一个人可以这么吵却又这么无聊。

"Oh. Well... that's good, then." Hikari breathed a sigh of relief. "I mean, not good that it went badly, b-but..." she searched for the end to her sentence. "...I mean it was a test run, right?"  
哦，好吧...那挺好的。" 光松了一口气。"我是说，不是说它搞砸了很好，但是..." 她在寻找句子的结尾。"...我的意思是，这是一次测试运行，对吧？

In retrospect, Asuka had felt a little guilty at her choice of a guinea pig for the experiment. After all, Hikari was basically her best friend, and the class rep's feelings towards Touji were known far and wide within the school. It had been kind of a bitch move, and Asuka knew it.  
事后想来，明日香对自己选择实验用的小白鼠感到一丝愧疚。毕竟，光是她最亲密的朋友，而她对冬二的感情在学校里是广为人知的。这一举动确实有些不厚道，明日香心里有数。

"Yeah, a test run. No harm done." The smile across Hikari's face lifted Asuka's spirits. She smiled back. "Mind if I shower?"  
嗯，只是试运行，没出什么问题。" 光脸上的笑容让明日香的心情好了起来，她也回以微笑，问道："我洗个澡可以吗？

---

The truth was Hikari was often alone. Her youngest sister was now old enough to start making friends outside of the family, and her older sister and parents had slipped from Hikari's grasp a long time ago. She didn't feel that much of a rapport with her family anymore – it was a good house to return to at night, but it was often an empty one.  
实际上，光常常感到孤单。她最小的妹妹已长大，开始在家庭外结交朋友，而她的姐姐和父母早已远离她的生活很久了。光与家人的情感纽带已不再紧密——那是个夜晚归宿的好地方，但多数时候家里空无一人。

Hikari was well respected in her class, but she was often uncertain just how much she was liked. Friendships proved fleeting outside of class time – conversations were often awkward and hard to hold for her. It wasn't that Hikari didn't _want_ more friends, she just rarely had the chance to prove she could be friendly. She felt like she spent much of her time ordering classmates around and nagging them for assignments.  
光在班级里颇受尊敬，但她时常疑惑自己究竟有多受欢迎。课外的友情似乎总是短暂易逝，与同学们的交谈往往让她感到尴尬，难以深入。光并非不渴望更多的友谊，只是她鲜有机会展现自己友善的一面。她觉得自己大部分时间都在指挥同学、催促他们完成作业。

So an invitation to any sort of social event struck her as odd, as Hikari had never been to a party before. Not a proper one, anyway. Sure, there had been birthday parties as kids, and they had been mandatory and slightly awkward, but such things had faded out about the age of ten. Now, several years later, parties meant something different.  
因此，任何社交活动的邀请对她来说都显得很奇怪，因为光从未真正参加过派对。小时候虽然有过生日派对，但那些都是强制性的，且略显尴尬，大约十岁后就再也没了。如今，几年过去，派对对她来说有了不同的含义。

Hikari hadn't been to one of _those_ parties, but she would be lying to say she wasn't intrigued. Another plus: parties were social events. She could meet people, she could prove she wasn't just the stodgy, by-the-book, 'class rep'. Hikari could be fun! After all, she went to _parties!_ Ones with alcohol and boys! Hikari wouldn't mind being thought of as just a _little_ fun...  
光从未涉足过那样的派对，但她若说自己毫无好奇心，那便是自欺欺人。派对的另一个优点在于：它们是社交场合。她有机会结识新朋友，展示自己并非只是那个拘谨、墨守成规的“班代表”。光同样可以充满乐趣！毕竟，她参与派对，那些充满酒精与男孩的派对！光并不介意别人认为她略带几分趣味……

But 'intrigued' wasn't without it share of anxiety. What if someone saw her there and told her parents? Even if they weren't very close, they could still very easily punish Hikari, and it wasn't as if she could even make the excuse she was being dragged along by someone.  
然而，“好奇”背后也隐藏着一丝不安。倘若有人撞见她在那儿，并向她父母告密，那该如何是好？即便双方关系并不十分亲密，他们仍有能力轻易地惩罚光，况且她也无法辩解说自己是被别人硬拉去的。

Asuka walked into the room, drying her hair and yawning.  
明日香走进房间，一边擦着湿漉漉的头发，一边打着哈欠。

"So," the redhead asked, "what do you want to do tonight?"  
“那么，”红发女孩问道，“今晚你有什么打算？”

Hikari tilted her head. There was a pause before she spoke. "Well, actually..."  
光侧过头，稍作停顿后说道：“嗯，其实……”

---

Asuka hadn't been to a party since college. She had never been a heavy drinker, but had dabbled with her friends in Germany to decidedly negative results. Though she liked to brag about her curves, Asuka actually had a very slim figure, and was embarrassed to admit that her threshold for inebriation was quite low. Furthermore, she had discovered before that she had the alarming penchant for removing clothing when drunk, which she suspected would be even _less_ amusing now then when she was eleven and no one _wanted_ to see her naked.  
自大学毕业后，明日香就再也没参加过派对。她并非酗酒之人，但在德国与友人浅尝辄止，结果总是不尽人意。尽管她常夸耀自己的曼妙身姿，实则明日香身材纤细，她羞于启齿的是自己对酒精的耐受力极低。更让她困扰的是，她曾发现自己在醉酒后有脱衣的倾向，这让她觉得比十一岁时更不妥当，那时毕竟无人愿意目睹她的裸体。

And so, she had agreed to accompany Hikari to the party with two mental stipulations:  
因此，她答应陪光去参加派对，但心里有两个前提：

_1. Let Hikari have a good time (she's a good friend, she did you a huge favor last night, and you owe her for the Touji debacle), but don't let her get carried away_ and  
1. 让光尽情享受吧（她是个好朋友，昨晚帮了你大忙，而且你欠她一个关于透二的事），但别让她得意忘形，

_2. Don't fucking drink_ _**anything**__._  
2. 千万别喝任何东西。

Asuka figured it would at least be worth attending in order to distract herself from the thoughts that had been buzzing around her brain all morning, ever since the kiss with Suzuhara. She wasn't ready to face that. Not yet. She wanted to feel young, and young people put on their favorite clothes and dodged responsibility.  
明日香觉得，至少去参加活动能让她暂时摆脱从早上起就一直在脑海中挥之不去的思绪，尤其是与铃原的那一吻之后。她还没准备好直面这些情感。至少现在还不行。她渴望保持年轻的心态，而年轻人总是穿上最爱的衣服，逃避责任。

She glanced over at her friend, who was nervously shuffling her feet as they both stood outside of the door to the apartment. Music could be heard thudding through the walls of the building, and Hikari suddenly looked uncertain. _She's never done this. Help her out._ Asuka smirked at her friend.  
她向朋友那边瞥了一眼，只见朋友紧张地挪动着脚步，两人正站在公寓门外。音乐声透过墙壁传来，Hikari 突然显得有些犹豫。她从未尝试过这样的事情。Asuka 见状，对朋友微微一笑，示意她不必担心。

"Come on," Asuka said, planting her hands on her hips. "No one ever had fun standing outside of a party."  
来吧，" 明日香双手叉腰说道，"站在派对外面，谁会觉得好玩呢？

Asuka opened the door and pushed Hikari in first before entering in her usual fashion.  
明日香打开门，先把光推进去，然后像平常一样跟着进去。

The apartment was packed – there were people in every corner of every room. Asuka scanned the crowds, recognizing students from all over their school – mostly people she saw in the hallways from other homerooms, but a few from 2-A as well.  
公寓里人满为患，每个房间的每个角落都挤满了人。明日香环顾四周，认出了来自学校各处的学生，大部分是她在走廊上见过的其他班级的同学，也有几个是 2-A 班的。

_No wonder Hikari was invited. Nobody WASN'T._ Asuka deemed it prudent not to point this out to her friend, glanced over at Hikari, who still hovered in the doorway. She met Asuka's eyes like a fawn in headlights.  
难怪光会被邀请，其实没人不被邀请。明日香觉得没必要向朋友挑明这一点，她看了一眼光，光还在门口犹豫不决。她与明日香的目光相遇，仿佛一只小鹿突然被车灯照到，显得有些惊慌失措。

"Well, don't have too much fun all at once." Asuka rolled her eyes.  
“行了，别一下子乐过头了。” 明日香翻了个白眼。

"Um... you know, now that we're here, I'm not so sure about this..."  
嗯...你知道吗，现在我们既然已经到了这里，我反而开始不太确定这件事了...

"Oh come on! Where's your backbone, Horaki!" The German grabbed her friend's arm and dragged her deeper into the apartment, amidst her protests.  
“哎呀，别这样！堀木，你的勇气去哪儿了？”德国人紧紧抓住朋友的手臂，不顾她的反对，强行将她拖进了公寓的更深处。

"No, Asuka! Wait a second-"  
不，明日香！稍等一下——

"Hikari-chan!" At the sound of the foreign voice, Hikari stopped struggling. Two classmates from 2-A bounded up to them, beaming. "I can't believe you actually came! And you brought Sohryu-chan, too!"  
光莉酱！" 听到这异国的声音，光莉停止了挣扎。2-A 班的两位同学满面笑容地向他们跑来。"真没想到你真的来了！还带了苏琉酱一起来！

"Hey, guys!" Asuka had to nearly shout to make her voice heard over the music. She struggled to remember their names. "It's packed! How many people are here, anyway?"  
嘿，大家！" 明日香几乎要大声喊叫才能让自己的声音在音乐声中被听见。她费力地回忆着他们的名字。"这里真是人山人海！到底来了多少人啊？

"God, I'm not even sure," one of them confessed. "A lot more than I thought there would be!"  
天哪，我真不确定，"其中一人坦白说，"比我想象的要多得多！

Asuka forced herself to laugh. _Nope. I have no idea what your name is._  
明日香强颜欢笑。不，我完全不知道你叫什么名字。

"Do you want something, Hikari-chan?" The girl asked, motioning to the mixed drink in her hands.  
‘Hikari-chan，你需要些什么吗？’女孩问道，同时举起手中的混合饮料示意。

For a moment, the girl seemed hesitant, then a wave of resolve washed over her face and she nodded. "Yes, please." She glanced over at Asuka, and the redhead gave her a wink.  
片刻间，女孩似乎有些迟疑，但很快脸上浮现出坚定的神情，她点头道：“好的，请。”她看向明日香，红发的明日香向她眨了眨眼。

"Have fun." 尽情享受吧。

The girls led Hikari off into the human abyss. Asuka felt a little proud of her friend, but vowed to check on her as the night went on. She let the smile fall from her face, cracked her neck and set off into the house. _There's bound to be some fun around here, somewhere._  
女孩们领着光深入了人性的深渊。明日香为朋友感到一丝骄傲，但决心在夜晚继续关注她。她收起笑容，扭动脖子，踏入屋内。这里必定藏着些许乐趣，只是尚未发现。

Asuka elbowed and side-stepped her way through seemingly all of her middle school to get to the kitchen. Opening the refrigerator, she rummaged around for some carbonated drink she would be able to fake for something alcoholic. Asuka figured she'd just as soon not explain to anyone _why_ she wasn't drinking, so she'd choke down some coke and hope everyone around her was too drunk to notice. On the off chance they did realize, Asuka decided she'd tell them in no uncertain terms to fuck off and mind their own business. _Ah. There it is._ She grabbed a red cup and poured.  
明日香用肘推和侧步的方式穿过她整个中学，终于来到了厨房。她打开冰箱，四处翻找着能冒充酒精饮料的碳酸饮料。明日香心想，她宁愿不向任何人解释为什么她不喝酒，所以她会勉强喝下一些可乐，并希望周围的人都喝醉了，不会注意到她。万一他们真的发现了，明日香决定会毫不客气地让他们滚开，别管闲事。啊，找到了。她拿起一个红色杯子倒了起来。

Walking back through the main room, her mind began to wander. She wondered if it would be at all possible for her to somehow slip out for an hour or two and find something else to do. But where could she go, anyway? It wasn't as if she had-  
穿过主厅返回时，她的思绪开始游离。她琢磨着是否能找个机会溜出去一两个小时，做点别的事情。但她又能去哪儿呢？她似乎并没有什么地方可去——

And then something bumped into Asuka's back, causing her to spill her soda everywhere, though mostly down the front of her white shirt with the red trim.  
接着，有什么东西撞到了明日香的背部，结果她的汽水洒了一地，主要都溅在了她那件带有红色镶边的白衬衫前襟上。

"Oh, you son of a _bitch_!" Her voice right through the cacophony of the music and room chatter, and soon half the room was turned towards her and her unfortunate victim. For a moment, she stared down at her doused stomach, helpless to do anything but watch as the dark liquid stained the fabric. _I loved this shirt..._ Her empty cup dropped to the floor, crushed.  
“哦，你这个混蛋！”她的声音在音乐和房间的喧闹中格外刺耳，很快半个房间的目光都转向了她和她那不幸的受害者。她低头凝视着被泼湿的腹部，眼睁睁看着深色液体在布料上留下污渍，无计可施。这件衬衫她一直很喜欢……手中的空杯子落地，碎裂声响起。

"You're _dead!_" The fuming redhead spun and grabbed the shirt cuff of the interloper, cocking her fist back for a punch. "You like the idea of eating your own teeth?"  
你死定了！" 红发女子怒气冲冲地转身，一把抓住了闯入者的衣袖，拳头蓄势待发。"你是不是喜欢咬碎自己的牙齿？

"No! I'm sorry! I was just pushed and I stumbled! It was an accident!"  
不！抱歉！我被人推了一下，不小心绊倒了！真的是个意外！

Asuka's blood froze. _No._ 明日香的血液仿佛凝固了。不，不可能。

She knew that voice. She knew this face. When no punch came, the boy looked up at his attacker and his jaw slackened.  
她熟悉那声音，也认得这张脸。见没有拳头打来，男孩抬起头望向攻击者，下巴不由得松懈下来。

"...Sohryu?" Kensuke adjusted his glasses to make sure he wasn't mistaken. Asuka released her captive. _No. If Aida's here then that means..._  
"...Sohryu?" 健介推了推眼镜，确认自己没有看错。明日香松开了她的俘虏。不对，如果相田在这里，那就意味着...

"I don't know what's happening, Touji. Just wait a second and we'll find out." Shinji made his way through the gawking crowd towards the center, where a circle had formed around the combatants. Upon his arrival at the edge of the circle, he stopped dead, caught by the coldest of blue stares.  
"我不清楚发生了什么事，冬二。稍等片刻，我们就会明白的。" 真嗣穿过围观的人群，走向中心，那里已经形成了一个围绕着战斗者的圈子。当他到达圈子边缘时，他突然停下脚步，被一道冰冷的蓝色目光所吸引。

"Is it over? Did we miss a fight?" Touji emerged from behind Shinji. "Where's Kensuke, anyway? Maybe he saw something?" Soon the smirk disappeared from Touji's face altogether.  
"已经结束了吗？我们是不是错过了什么战斗？" 东治从真嗣身后走了出来。"健介到底去哪儿了？或许他看到了什么？" 不久，东治脸上的讥笑完全消失了。

"Aw, hell." 哎，真是的。

---

In the hallway outside the party, moments later:  
在派对外的走廊上，稍后片刻：

"What are you doing here?" Asuka demanded.  
"你在这里干什么？" 明日香质问。

"What am **I** doing here? You didn't come home last night, Asuka. We were worried sick!" Shinji returned her glare. "And now you're at some party? What's going through your head? What are _you_ doing here?"  
我在这里干嘛呢？你昨晚没回家，明日香。我们担心得要命！" 真嗣回瞪了她一眼。"现在你却在参加什么派对？你脑子里在想什么？你在这里到底在做什么？

"I'm here for Hikari!" Asuka was doing her very best to keep her voice at a reasonable volume, but she wasn't succeeding. "She pulled me off the street and gave me a place to stay for the night! It was the least I could do for her! She's my best friend."  
"我是为了光来的！" 明日香竭力让自己的声音保持在一个合理的音量，但未能如愿。"她把我从街上带回家，给了我一个过夜的地方！这是我起码能回报她的！她是我最好的朋友。

"I went home after the date. Just saying." Touji offered. "Not sure what got _you_ so sidetracked that you were all the way over near the class rep's house."  
“约会结束后我就回家了。只是随口一说。” 东治说道，“不知道是什么让你分心到跑到班长家附近去了。”

"Nobody asked you, Suzuhara! I can wander wherever the hell I want!" She turned back to Shinji. "Why are you here?"  
没人问你，铃原！我想去哪儿就去哪儿！" 她转头对真嗣说："你为什么在这里？

"I was at Touji's house. Blackout happened." Shinji shrugged. "We came here. There's supposed to be one at Misato's later anyway, so I-"  
我当时在东治家里。突然停电了。" 真嗣耸了耸肩，接着说，"我们过来了。反正晚些时候在美里那里还有一个聚会，所以我——

"I'm really sorry about bumping you, Sohryu!" Kensuke piped up from near the doorway. "I just wanted to make it abundantly clear, with everyone as witnesses: I'm sorry. It was an accident." He adjusted his glasses and slinked towards the nearest possible exit. "...that is all."  
苏利，我真的很抱歉不小心撞到你！" 健介在门口附近大声说道，"我想当着大家的面，清楚地表达我的歉意：对不起，这完全是个意外。" 他扶了扶眼镜，悄悄地向最近的出口移动。"...我说完了。

"How do you know where Hikari's house is, by the way?" Asuka shot spitefully at Touji. "Just as a matter of passing interest. Been there often?"  
对了，你怎么知道光的家在哪儿？" 明日香带着一丝恶意向真嗣发问，"只是随便问问。你常去吗？

"Is that coke on your blouse? Was the two percent milk too strong for you?"  
你衬衫上的是可乐吗？那 2%的牛奶对你来说是不是太浓了？

Asuka's look could have wilted flowers. She reddened slightly. "Bite me."  
明日香的眼神犀利到仿佛能让花朵枯萎。她脸上泛起一丝红晕，轻声说道：“随你怎么说。”

"Why didn't you come home?" Shinji stared at the redhead, confused. "I was up waiting for you until-"  
你为什么没回家？" 真嗣困惑地盯着红发女孩。"我一直等到你-

"I just had to clear my head, okay?" Asuka said. "It's really not a big deal. Let it go."  
我需要冷静一下，好吗？" 明日香说道，"真的没什么大不了的，别再纠结了。

"In a storm like that? Are you insane?" Shinji was incredulous. "You could have gotten hurt!"  
在那样的大风暴中？你疯了吗？" 真嗣难以置信地说。"你可能会受伤的！

"It _was_ pretty intense last night..." Kensuke added, contemplatively.  
"昨晚真是相当激烈啊..." 健介若有所思地补充说。

"No, really. I'm honestly kind of curious, Sohryu. What's with the soda?" Touji pointed to the dark stain down Asuka's front. "I mean, there's alcohol stuffed into every corner in there. You must have really had to search to get something that wasn't beer. Why?"  
不，真的。我确实有点好奇，Sohryu。这汽水是怎么回事？" 透治指着明日香胸前的深色污渍。"我是说，那里每个角落都塞满了酒。你一定费了好大劲才找到不是啤酒的东西。为什么？

Asuka's eyes blazed. "Maybe I didn't _want_ beer, you idiot!" The pilot abandoned any pretense of being quiet. "I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu! I'm the best Evangelion pilot in the goddamn country! I can drink what I want!"  
明日香的眼神中燃烧着怒火。“或许我根本不想喝啤酒，你这个笨蛋！”她不再掩饰自己的情绪，大声说道：“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！我是这个国家最顶尖的 EVA 驾驶员！我想喝什么就喝什么！”

"What would we have done if you got hurt, Asuka?" Shinji continued. "You're important to a lot of people."  
要是你受伤了，我们该怎么办呢，明日香？" 真嗣接着说，"你对于很多人来说非常重要。

"Oh, because we can't get hurt when we pilot," she countered derisively. "I can take care of myself, Shinji! I don't need anyone to look out for me! Least of all-"  
“呵，驾驶时我们不会受伤，”她嘲讽地反驳，“我能自保，真嗣！我不需要谁来保护我！尤其是——”

"Wait a second..." Touji pointed accusingly at her, a laugh escaping his lips. "You're scared! You've never been drunk, have you, Sohryu? You don't know what it feels like and you're scared!"  
等一下..." 透治指着她，笑着责备道，"你害怕了！你从没喝醉过，对吧，苏里？你不知道那是什么感觉，所以你害怕了！

Asuka flushed a deep, crimson red, and her hands clenched tightly into fists. "I am _not_ scared."  
明日香的脸颊涨得通红，双手紧握成拳。她坚定地说：“我并不害怕。”

"Well, you sure look scared." Touji smiled. "Are you positive you don't want to put some ice in your-"  
哎，你看起来真的很害怕啊。" 透治笑着说。"你真的不想在...里加点冰块吗？

She grabbed the front of Touji's shirt and slammed the boy into the wall, cutting him off mid-sentence. Shinji and Kensuke watched, too stunned to intercede on either side. When Asuka spoke, the tone of her voice was unmistakably hostile.  
她一把抓住冬二衬衫的前襟，猛地将他撞向墙壁，打断了他的话。真嗣和健介在一旁目瞪口呆，无法介入。明日香开口时，语气中明显带着敌意。

"Let's get one thing straight here, Suzuhara: I am _**not**_ scared. I pilot a machine you couldn't begin to comprehend, facing true horror on a daily basis to save people like _you_ from having to die. The fate of the world is on my shoulders. The life of every single person in that room and in this city depends on what I do when I wake up in the morning, and how good I am at doing it." Asuka brought their faces within inches of each other. Her final words came out in a whisper. "I'm not scared of _anything_."  
铃原，我们得把话说清楚：我并不害怕。我操控着一台你无法理解的机器，每天直面真正的恐怖，只为拯救像你这样的人免于死亡。世界的命运就压在我肩上。房间里和这座城市的每一个人的生命，都取决于我早上醒来后所做的决定，以及我执行得有多好。" 明日香将他们的脸贴近到仅几英寸之遥。她的最后一句话轻声细语："我无所畏惧。

The music from the party hit a surge, and cheering could be heard from inside of the room.  
派对音乐骤然激增，房间里响起了阵阵欢呼。

Touji smirked. 冬二露出了得意的微笑。

"...prove it." ...来证明这一点。

---

"They're just shots, Sohryu. No big deal." Touji shrugged, gesturing to the drinks on the table between them. There were two rows of five shots, one lined up after the other, half for Touji and half for her. "Nothing you can't handle, I'm sure."  
这些不过是些酒，Sohryu。没什么大不了的。" 透治耸耸肩，指向两人之间的桌上摆着的两排五杯酒，一排接着一排，一人一半。"我相信你肯定能应付得来。

"Then why are we still talking about it?" Asuka gestured towards the boy with her chin. "On three." The crowd around them counted down enthusiastically, and Asuka knocked back the first tumbler.  
“那我们为何还在讨论此事？” 明日香用下巴示意了一下那个男孩。“三二一。” 周围的人群热情地倒数，明日香随即一饮而尽第一杯。

"Asuka, this is stupid," Shinji stood next to his friend, his brow furrowed. "Let's go home."  
明日香，这太傻了，" 真嗣站在朋友身旁，眉头紧皱。"我们回家吧。

She shook her head, swallowing the liquid. It burned as it went down her throat. _This is a mistake_. "Shut up, Shinji." She put the glass down. "Next one. On three." Touji nodded and Asuka picked up the next drink.  
她摇摇头，咽下那液体，感觉喉咙一阵灼热。这显然是个错误。“别说了，真嗣。”她放下杯子，“再来一杯，三二一。”冬二点头示意，明日香随即拿起下一杯酒。

"You don't have to prove anything!" Shinji spread his arms in protest. "Touji's just being an idiot."  
你没必要证明什么！" 真嗣张开双臂抗议，"东治只是在犯傻而已。

Three. Two. One. 三，二，一。

Another. Asuka felt a shudder run through her body. "You still game, Suzuhara?"  
另一个。明日香感到一阵颤栗传遍全身。“铃原，你还能继续吗？”

"You kidding? I could do this all night!" He smiled. "Next!" They picked up their shots in tandem.  
"开玩笑吗？我整晚都能做！" 他笑着说，"下一个！" 他们同步举杯。

Hikari emerged next to Shinji, a drink in her hand, looking slightly dazed. "What's going on?" she asked no one in particular.  
光里出现在真嗣身旁，手中握着一杯饮料，神情略显恍惚。她环顾四周，喃喃自语：“这是怎么回事？”

"THREE -Asuka- TWO -honestly- ONE! -stop." Shinji grabbed at his friend's arm, which she wrenched out of his grasp as she downed the shot.  
"三 -明日香- 二 -坦白说- 一！ -停。" 真嗣试图抓住朋友的胳膊，但她迅速挣脱，一口喝干了那杯酒。

Asuka felt her fingers starting to numb pleasantly. _Damn it. That's happening fast. Why do I have the alcohol tolerance of an infant?_  
明日香感觉到手指开始愉悦地麻木。真是的，这反应也太快了吧。怎么我的酒量跟婴儿似的？

Scowling, she angrily grabbed the next glass. _Just one more after this. Just one more._ Touji drew his arm across his mouth, his eyes bright with triumph. _He thinks I can't do it._ Asuka fumed. She shot her fourth drink, threw down the cup, and took the last in a single motion, not tasting the contents of either one. The last glass fumbled out of her hands, but Asuka held her arms aloft victoriously. _Done._  
她皱着眉头，气愤地抓起下一个杯子。就剩最后一个了。冬二用手臂擦了擦嘴，眼中闪烁着胜利的光芒。他以为我做不到。明日香气愤地想。她迅速喝下第四杯，扔掉杯子，然后一气呵成地拿起最后一杯，两杯都没尝出味道。最后一个杯子从她手中滑落，但明日香高举双臂，胜利地站着。完成了。

The crowd cheered, and she laughed despite herself. The room felt stiflingly hot, and Asuka realized she was sweating. She turned to Touji, and pointing a finger at him, she said: "Not anything, Touji. Nothing at all."  
人群的欢呼声中，她情不自禁地笑了起来。房间里闷热得让人透不过气，明日香发现自己已经汗流浃背。她转向真人，指着他，语气坚定地说：“真人，什么都没有。”

He put his glass on the table, swallowing the last of the shots. He clapped out congratulations, and Asuka found herself fascinated by the movement of his hands. She held the table for support. It was so hot in this damn room. She pinched the front of her dress and fanned herself with it.  
他将杯子搁在桌上，饮尽最后一口酒。他鼓掌以示祝贺，明日香不由自主地被他手的动作所吸引。她倚靠着桌子以稳住自己。这房间热得让人受不了。她捏起裙摆，轻轻扇动以缓解燥热。

Looking over to her right, she saw Shinji looking worried. _Why are you always so worried, Shinji? I'm fine. If you've got wings you should use them._ Asuka couldn't remember for the life of her where she'd heard that phrase before. Letting go of the table, a smile burst across her face. "I'm still standing, Shinji. Don't need any help."  
她转头向右，看到真嗣面带忧虑。真嗣，为何你总是如此担忧？我一切都好。若你拥有翅膀，就该展翅飞翔。明日香怎么也想不起曾在何处听过这句话。她松开桌子，脸上绽放出笑容，说道：“我依然站得稳，真嗣，不需要任何帮助。”

He didn't say anything back.  
他什么也没说回来。

"Another round?" Touji asked.  
"再来一局吗？" 透治问道。

"Hell yes." Asuka replied. "Do your worst."  
当然可以。" 明日香答道。"你尽管来吧，我无所畏惧。

Shinji stood and watched as his friend drank herself into oblivion.  
真嗣站在一旁，目睹他的朋友酣畅淋漓地饮酒至醉。

---

It was late, maybe past two, but Kyo had his target picked a long time ago: the redhead. She was blasted – couldn't even stand properly. He watched as she fell to the floor for the umpteenth time, and marveled at how she was even still conscious. She stayed on the floor this time, on her back, laughing at the ceiling, and held her arms out, waving her hands to try and touch the lamp 10 feet above her.  
夜已深，或许已过凌晨两点，然而京早已锁定目标：那位红发女子。她酩酊大醉，连站都站不稳。他目睹她一次又一次跌倒在地，不禁惊叹她竟还能保持意识。这次她躺在地上，仰面朝天，对着天花板大笑，伸出手臂，挥动双手，试图触及头顶十英尺高的吊灯。

She was the one, alright. Completely blacked out. She wouldn't remember anything in the morning. Kyo licked his lips and took strides towards her.  
她确实是那个人，没错。完全失去了意识，早上醒来什么也不会记得。Kyo 舔了舔嘴唇，迈步向她走去。

Crouching next to the foreigner, Kyo offered a hand.  
蹲在外国人身旁，Kyo 伸出手来帮忙。

"You look tired," he said, smiling. "Would you like to find somewhere to lie down?"  
“你看上去很疲惫，”他笑着说，“要不要找个地方休息一下？”

The girl looked over at him. Some slurred language Kyo didn't understand came out, and she laughed at her own joke. The redhead propped herself up on her arms and looked over at him. She cleared her throat.  
女孩转头看向他，嘴里吐出一些京听不懂的含糊话语，她却因自己的笑话笑了起来。红发女孩用双臂撑起身体，转头望向他，然后清了清嗓子。

"No. Go away." She fell back down to the carpet. Undeterred, Kyo reached down for her arm.  
"不，走开。" 她再次跌坐在地毯上。Kyo 并未因此退缩，反而俯身去拉她的手臂。

"Come on," he entreated, "it's getting a little late. It's high time we found somewhere you can spend the night, don't you think? I think there's a free room down the hallway if-"  
“来吧，”他催促说，“天色已晚。我们得找个地方让你过夜，你觉得呢？走廊那边好像有间空房，如果——”

The girl's hand flew through the air and struck Kyo across the face hard, forcing him to relinquish his grip on her elbow. "Fick dich!" she bellowed. She rolled off of her stomach onto her back. "Warum fühle ich so heiß? Fühlst du dich heiß, auch?"  
女孩的手猛地挥过空中，重重地打在京的脸上，迫使他松开了抓着她肘部的手。“滚开！”她怒吼道。她从趴着的姿势翻滚到仰躺。“为什么我感觉这么热？你也觉得热吗？”

Fusiously, Kyo grabbed her shoulders. "Listen up you little bitch," he hissed. "I don't think you're quite getting the message here..."  
愤然间，Kyo 紧紧抓住她的肩膀。“听着，你这小家伙，”他低语道，“看来你还没完全领会这里的信息……”

"Let go of her right now."  
立刻放开她。

Kyo looked up. _Oh, this guy._ It was her short friend. Kyo had seem him hanging around the girl all night, and had chosen this moment to strike due to his absence. Friends were usually witnesses, which could be annoying down the road.  
京抬头一看，哦，原来是她的矮个子朋友。京整晚都注意到他在女孩周围徘徊，趁他不在的时候选择了这个时机行动。毕竟，朋友通常是目击者，这可能会在将来带来麻烦。

This kid was shrimpy though, and Kyo was pretty certain he'd also been drinking himself_._ Kyo released the girl and stood to his full height, towering over the boy.  
这孩子虽然瘦弱，但京很肯定他也在酗酒。京松开女孩，站直身体，居高临下地看着男孩。

"I think the lady needs a place to sleep it off. I was being kind enough to offer her assistance."  
我觉得这位女士需要找个地方休息一下。我出于好意，主动提出要帮她。

"She said no." 她拒绝了。

"You sure about that?" Kyo leaned forward, his voice a growl. This was the moment most friends crumbled and left well enough alone. To his surprise, the boy didn't flinch.  
"你确定吗？" Kyo 身体前倾，声音低沉如兽吼。通常在这个时刻，大多数朋友都会崩溃并选择不再深究。然而，令他惊讶的是，那个男孩并未退缩。

"She's not interested. Get out of here." He walked over to the girl on the ground and slung her arm over his shoulder. "Come on, Asuka. We're going home."  
她对此毫无兴趣。赶紧离开这儿。" 他走向坐在地上的女孩，扶起她并将她的手臂搭在自己肩上。"走吧，明日香，我们回家。

Kyo lunged forward, punching the boy across the face and sprawling him across the ground. He didn't move. _That settles that._  
京猛地冲上前去，一拳击中男孩的脸，使其摔倒在地。男孩一动不动。事情就这样解决了。

Kyo was surprised by a projectile beer bottle smacking him in the side of the head, followed by a taller boy leaping into the confrontation and punching him in the gut. "Stay away from Shinji!" he yelled, swinging wildly. He was significantly more inebriated than his shrimpy friend, and his attacks flung nowhere near Kyo at all.  
Kyo 突然被一个飞来的啤酒瓶击中头部，随即一个高个子男孩冲进冲突，猛击他的腹部。“别靠近 Shinji！”他咆哮着，胡乱挥拳。他显然比他的小个子朋友醉得更厉害，攻击完全偏离了 Kyo。

"To the left, Touji! The left!" A third boy with glasses hung on the outskirts of the fight beside a mousy girl holding a plastic cup. She yelled, too: "Suzuhara-kun! Watch out for Asuka-chan!"  
往左，斗真！左边！" 一个戴眼镜的男孩在战斗边缘徘徊，旁边是一个拿着塑料杯的胆小女孩。她也喊道："铃原君！小心明日香！

"Stand still, you asshole!" The taller boy tripped over the slumbering foreigner and fell face first onto the floor. The first boy to got back to his feet.  
"别动，你这混蛋！" 高个子男孩被熟睡的外国人绊倒，脸朝下摔在了地上。第一个男孩迅速站了起来。

Shrimpy cocked back his fist and leapt upon Kyo, driving him to the ground and landing a flurry of surprisingly strong blows across Kyo's face.  
斯里姆挥拳后退，猛地扑向京，将他击倒，随后对着京的脸部连续打出了一连串出乎意料的强劲拳击。

Kyo felt his vision beginning to creep in at the edges. He tasted blood in his mouth, and his head was killing him from where the bottle had hit it before. The boy gathered Kyo's shirt in his hands and pulled him close enough to hear.  
Kyo 感到视野边缘开始模糊，嘴里尝到了血腥味，头部因之前被瓶子击中而剧痛不已。男孩紧抓 Kyo 的衬衫，将他拉近至耳语可闻的距离。

"She's drunk. She probably has no idea what she's doing. That means that tonight she's _off limits._ If you get up again, you'll regret it for the rest of your life, I swear to god." He let Kyo fall back onto the floor and stood up.  
她已经醉了，很可能不知道自己在做什么。所以今晚她是个禁区。如果你再有动作，我敢保证你会后悔终生。他让京重新躺回地板，然后自己站了起来。

Shinji wiped the blood off of his knuckles as he walked over to his friend. "Touji, are you okay?"  
真嗣走向朋友的同时，擦掉了指关节上的血迹，问道：“斗志，你没事吧？”

Touji sat up. "Where'd he go? Is it done?" Shinji offered a hand.  
冬二坐起身来，问道：“他去哪儿了？事情解决了吗？” 真嗣随即伸出手去。

"Thank you." 感谢您。

Touji took the hand and stood, smiling. "Anytime." Hikari came to his side, offering him a shoulder to lean on. "I was pretty good back there, eh? What do you think, class rep?" Hikari blushed, partially from alcohol, and partially from the contact with her crush.  
冬二握住手站起身，微笑道：“随时奉陪。”光走到他身旁，让他倚靠自己的肩膀。“我刚才表现得很棒吧？你觉得呢，班长？”光的脸颊泛红，一部分是酒精的作用，另一部分则是与心仪对象的亲密接触所致。

"I thought you were wonderful, Suzuhara-kun..." she admitted shyly. Touji grinned broadly.  
"我觉得你真的很出色，铃原君……" 她羞涩地坦白道。 东治开心地笑了。

"Look, Kensuke. I'm wonderful."  
瞧，健介。我真是太棒了。

"You're also bleeding." Kensuke offered a napkin. "Here. Your nose." Hikari took the napkin and began to gently dab at Touji's face.  
"你也流血了。" 健介递给透司一张纸巾。"给，擦擦你的鼻子。" 光接过纸巾，温柔地为透司擦拭脸上的血迹。

Shinji leaned down and scooped up Asuka in his arms. Fast asleep, she was lighter than he thought anyone could possibly be.  
真嗣俯身将明日香抱起，她正熟睡，轻盈得超乎他的想象。

Every once in a while, when it was early in the morning or late at night, Asuka would fall asleep next to Shinji on the couch in Misato's apartment, and though he would never admit it, he thought Asuka looked like an angel when she slept. Certainly she was no longer the terror of her waking hours. Suddenly, the meticulously placed defenses were down, and there was indeed a girl underneath the jaded armor.  
偶尔，在清晨或深夜，明日香会在美里公寓的沙发上靠在真嗣旁边入睡。尽管他从未承认，但他觉得明日香睡着时宛如天使。她不再是醒着时的那个令人畏惧的形象。突然间，那些精心构建的防线瓦解了，在那层疲惫的外壳下，确实藏着一个真实的女孩。

He felt her nuzzle into the crook of his arm and he realized she was talking.  
他感觉到她依偎进他的臂弯，这才意识到她在说话。

"Don't get hurt..." she muttered. "What would I do if you got hurt...? Baka-Shinji..." Shinji felt his heart melt.  
"别让自己受伤..." 她轻声说道。"你要是受伤了，我该怎么办呢...？真嗣，你这个笨蛋..." 真嗣的心瞬间软化了。

Turning to his friends, he decided: "We're leaving."  
他转向朋友们，果断地说：“我们走吧。”

---

It was past three am when Shinji walked into Misato's apartment, Asuka slung over his back. She had proven much heavier when the adrenalin from the fight had worn out, and Shinji waddled under her weight into her bedroom. Letting her fall off his back, onto her cot, he let out a massive sigh of relief.  
凌晨三点已过，真嗣背着明日香走进美里公寓。战斗中的肾上腺素消退后，她显得格外沉重，真嗣步履蹒跚地把她背进她的卧室。让她从背上滑落到床上，他长长地舒了一口气，感到如释重负。

"We're home," he announced to no one at all. _Where's Misato?_  
"我们到家了，" 他对着空无一人的房间说道。美里去哪儿了？

Shinji fell back on top of Asuka, lying for a second to catch his breath. Under his weight, Asuka stirred.  
真嗣跌倒在明日香身上，躺了一会儿喘口气。在他的重压下，明日香微微动了动。

"Mein Gott..." she yawned, sitting up. "Where am I?"  
我的天哪..." 她打着哈欠坐起身来。"我这是在哪儿？

"You're back at the apartment. I carried you." He let out a large breath of air. "It sucked."  
你已经回到公寓了。是我把你背回来的。" 他深深地呼出一口气，"真是糟糕透了。

Asuka giggled, and Shinji was struck by how pleasing a sound it was to his ears. "Sorry," she said. He sighed.  
明日香轻声笑了起来，那声音在真嗣听来十分悦耳。她道歉道：“对不起。”真嗣叹了口气。

"Don't worry about it. I'm just happy to be home." He laughed. "It's been a weird night. To be honest, I didn't expect for it to end with me getting in a fight and then hauling you halfway across the city on my back." He touched the bruise on his cheek from where that guy had punched him. _How the hell did THAT whole thing happen?_  
"别担心了，能回家我就很开心。" 他笑着说，"今晚真是出乎意料。说实话，我没想到会卷入一场打斗，然后还背着你穿越了大半个城市。" 他轻轻触碰着脸颊上的淤青，心中疑惑，这一切究竟是怎么发生的？

Asuka's hand reached down and played with his hair absently. "So strong, Shinji-kun..."  
明日香的手轻轻垂下，不经意间拨弄着他的发丝。“真坚强啊，真嗣君……”

Shinji felt an involuntary shudder run through his body at her touch and the tone of her voice. It sounded...  
她的触摸和声音让真嗣不由自主地颤抖了一下。那声音...

_...incredibly sexy. 极其迷人。_

He sat up immediately, turning on the overhead lamp. Asuka winced, letting out a tone of displeasure at the intrusion of the light. "Well, I'm off to bed," Shinji announced, moving towards the doorway. "Goodnight."  
他随即坐起身，打开了顶灯。明日香因灯光的打扰而皱眉，发出了一声不满的叹息。“那么，我要去睡了，”真嗣说道，走向门口。“晚安。”

"Shinji, wait." Asuka reached for him, and against his better judgment, he stopped. He knew he couldn't stay here. His willpower wouldn't hold out much longer, and the last person on earth he wanted to be like was that monster who had attacked them at the party.  
"真嗣，等等。" 明日香伸手去抓他，尽管他理智上知道不该停下，但还是停住了。他明白自己不能留在这里。他的意志力撑不了多久，而在这个世界上，他最不想变成的就是那个在派对上攻击他们的怪物。

"Don't leave." she said, and for once, it was not a command. She was asking him. "Please," she continued, standing and advancing unsteadily towards him. Shinji was frozen, halfway out of the door. Asuka's hand slid across his arm. Shinji looked into her eyes. Those deep, blue eyes. They were so hopeful.  
"别走。" 她轻声说道，这次不再是命令，而是恳求。"求你了，" 她一边说，一边站起身，步履蹒跚地向他靠近。真嗣僵立在门口，半只脚已踏出门外。明日香的手轻轻滑过他的手臂，真嗣凝视着她的双眼，那深邃而湛蓝的眼眸中，满是期盼。

"Stay with me?" 留下来陪我好吗？

With a low hum, all the power in the apartment shut off. _The blackout._ Shinji swallowed, engulfed by shadows, no longer able to see his friend at all. He trembled slightly. This had to end here.  
低沉的嗡鸣声中，公寓的电源全部中断。陷入黑暗的真嗣，吞咽了一下，四周阴影笼罩，完全看不见朋友。他微微颤抖，意识到这一切必须在此刻终结。

"We're both really tired," he began. "We should -"  
我们都感到非常疲惫，" 他开口道。"我们该 -

"I lied before." 我之前说了谎。

"...what?" ...什么？

"About not being afraid of anything. That's bullshit. I _wish_ I wasn't afraid. The Angels scare me, pain scares me, death scares me, all sorts of things do. But... the truth is that sometimes I'm so scared, that I push away what I really want. Because if I can't have what I want... then I don't want to want it. Do you know what I mean? I don't know if I'm making any sense. I think I'm pretty drunk." He heard her laugh softly. In the black it felt as if they were the only two people left in the entire world.  
“说无所畏惧，那纯属扯淡。我多希望自己能不害怕。天使、痛苦、死亡，还有许多其他事情都让我感到恐惧。然而...真相是，有时我害怕到会逃避自己真正渴望的东西。因为如果我无法拥有它...那么我宁愿不再渴望。你懂我的意思吗？我也不知道自己说得是否清楚。可能我喝得有点多了。”他听到她轻声笑了。在黑暗中，仿佛整个世界只剩下他们两人。

"I'm not afraid right now, Shinji," her hand gently squeezed his arm. "It might just be the alcohol but, hey, if you've got wings..."  
我现在并不害怕，真嗣，" 她的手温柔地握住他的手臂。"或许是酒精的影响，但如果你有翅膀的话...

"Asuka, what are you-" 明日香，你在做什么——

"Stop talking." 别再说了。

"But-" 但是——

Shinji felt hands loop around the back of his neck, and Asuka pulled him into a soft, tender kiss. Time stopped completely. Shinji forgot what he was talking about, he forgot everything that had been worrying him. He tasted her, he felt her in his arms, and she was perfect.  
真嗣感觉到明日香的手环绕在他的颈后，她温柔地吻了他。那一刻，时间仿佛静止了。真嗣忘记了之前的话题，忘记了所有烦恼。他品味着她的吻，感受着她的温暖，她是如此完美。

Asuka, for her part, simply felt complete. She had never felt anything so beautiful before in her entire life.  
至于明日香，她只觉得心满意足。她这辈子从未体验过如此美妙的感觉。

Eventually, the kiss stopped, and the two teenagers held each other at arm's length. Their breathing was the only sound in the apartment. Shinji felt her finger lightly touch his nose.  
终于，亲吻结束了，两个少年彼此拉开些许距离，紧紧相拥。整个公寓内，唯有他们急促的呼吸声回荡。真嗣感受到她的手指轻柔地触碰着他的鼻尖。

"Baka..." there was a smile in her voice.  
"傻瓜..." 她的声音里透着笑意。

Asuka let go of him for a moment, and Shinji heard the rustling of her shirt being pulled off.  
明日香暂时松开了手，真嗣听到她脱掉衬衫时发出的窸窣声。

Suddenly, Shinji realized where he was, and his pulse raced. He had fantasized about this moment for years, but those had been harmless fantasies. He never thought it would actually ever be happening to him. There were no repercussions in fantasies, real life was not so forgiving. He desperately wanted Asuka, more than he imagined possible, but not like this. Through the buzz in his head, he heard his conscience clear as day:  
突然间，真嗣意识到自己的处境，心跳不由得加速。多年来，他虽曾幻想过这一刻，但那些不过是些无伤大雅的白日梦。他从未料想这些幻想会成真。在幻想的世界里，一切后果皆无，而现实生活却远非如此宽恕。他对明日香的渴望，比任何时候都要强烈，但绝非以这种方式。尽管脑海中一片嘈杂，他的良知却清晰如白昼般响起：

_This isn't right. She's drunk. You're drunk. Don't let this happen.  
这不对劲。她醉了，你也醉了。别让这种情况发生。_

"Hold on," he said, "this isn't-"  
等等，" 他说，"这不是……

Asuka pulled Shinji into a deeper kiss, and without further protest, they fell together onto the floor, under cover of darkness.  
明日香加深了与真嗣的吻，两人未再抗拒，在夜幕的遮掩下双双倒地。

_AN: But of course that's not the end. There are, after all, consequences for every action, and **these** consequences are just too intriguing not to give at least a once-over. I'm thinking one more chapter left before this story is over, perhaps two if I'm feeling really verbose. Hopefully it's a happy ending, as this monster's kind of taken on a life of its own when I type. Heh, was not originally planning to go all 'in vino veritas' on everyone, so all bets for my original plans are kind of off...  
当然，这并非故事的终点。毕竟，每个行动都会带来后果，而这些后果实在太过引人入胜，不容忽视。我想再写一章这个故事就该落幕了，如果我感到特别啰嗦，或许会写两章。希望是个圆满的结局，因为这只怪物在我打字时似乎有了自己的生命。嘿，原本并没有打算对大家说“酒后吐真言”，所以对我最初的计划的所有赌注都取消了..._

_Regardless, thank you for your patience with me and my work here. I hope it's been entertaining, and I'll try to get the conclusion to you as soon as possible.  
无论如何，感谢您对我和我在此工作的耐心。希望这段时间能带给您乐趣，我会尽快完成结论并交给您。_

### Chapter 5 All I Have
Warmth. Something warm and soft and gentle. Her bare foot was touching it.  
温暖的感觉。那种既温暖又柔软，还带着一丝温柔的触感。她的赤脚正轻轻地接触着它。

Asuka opened her eyes to white-hot pain from the morning sunlight. She groaned. Her head still stung horribly from the events of last night, and movement exacerbated the pain. Deeming waking up to be a terrible idea, Asuka rolled over, cuddling into the aforementioned warm, soft, gentle something.  
明日香睁开双眼，感受到早晨阳光带来的灼热痛楚。她不禁呻吟，昨晚的记忆仍让她的头隐隐作痛，任何动作都让疼痛加剧。她觉得醒来实在不是个好主意，于是转身蜷缩，依偎在那温暖柔软的怀抱中。

Only semi-conscious, she wrapped her arms around the other occupant of the bed and pulled him towards her, making a small noise of pleasure at the touch of skin and departure of light. His arms wrapped around her reciprocally, bringing her closer, until her limbs were entwined with his, shifting slightly for comfort. Asuka breathed in happily. This place was safe. She was protected. _This is perfect_.  
她半梦半醒间，双臂环抱住床上的另一个人，将他拉近自己，肌肤相触、光线隐去之际，她发出了一声愉悦的轻哼。对方也以双臂回拥，将她紧紧揽入怀中，直至两人四肢交缠，稍作调整以求舒适。明日香满足地呼吸着，心中感到无比安宁。这里是个避风港，她被守护着，一切都恰到好处。

But then, through the haze of hangover and sleepiness, Asuka realized it was unusual for her to have anything in her bed save for herself. Investigation was probably advisable. She sat up gingerly, holding her skull and reeling from the massive headache that kicked into high gear at every small movement. Slowly, painfully, Asuka opened her eyes.  
然而，随着宿醉与困倦的迷雾逐渐散去，明日香意识到床上除了自己还有其他东西颇为反常。或许进行一番调查是明智之举。她小心翼翼地坐起身，双手抱头，每动一下都会引发剧烈的头痛。她缓慢而痛苦地睁开了双眼。

She couldn't stop the gasp from escaping her lips.  
她无法抑制那声惊呼从唇边溜出。

_No._

Cold fear surged through her body. She was naked. Shinji was naked. Asuka's immediately hand shot beneath the covers to between her legs.  
一股冰冷的恐惧在她体内蔓延开来。她和真嗣都赤身裸体。明日香迅速将手伸到被子下，探向自己的双腿之间。

_Please no. Please. 请不要这样。求你了。_

_Oh thank_ _**GOD**__._ 哦，谢天谢地。

Asuka exhaled a massive sigh, almost laughing with relief. She held her arms, letting the panic slowly ebb away.  
明日香深深地叹了一口气，几乎笑了出来，感到一阵释然。她环抱双臂，让紧张的情绪逐渐平息。

_Nothing happened. She's still there. Nothing happened...  
一切如常，她依旧在那儿，没有任何变化……_

Swallowing, she glanced over at the sleeping boy next to her. Asuka's movements had pulled the covers down, revealing more of Shinji than modesty would normally allow. Blushing, Asuka gently pulled the sheets above his waist. She couldn't help but also notice a bruise forming on his cheek and what looked like scratches on his back from nails. Her brow furrowed.  
她咽了口唾沫，目光掠过身旁熟睡的男孩。明日香的移动使得被子滑落，露出了比平时更多真嗣的身体。明日香脸颊泛红，轻柔地将床单拉至他的腰部。同时，她注意到他脸颊上的淤青和背部疑似被指甲抓出的痕迹，眉头不由得紧皱。

_Well, SOMETHING happened.  
总之，发生了一些事情。_

Asuka closed her eyes and struggled to remember, trying to _will_ her mind to fill in the blanks. She remembered the first two rounds of shots with Touji, she remembered hearing Hikari's laughter, and she had vague memories of tripping over a stool. Asuka felt for her elbow, wincing with pain at the touch. _Yeah, that definitely happened._  
明日香闭上双眼，竭力回想，希望自己的意识能填补记忆的空缺。她清晰记得与筒井共同经历的前两轮射击，耳边回荡着光的声音，而对于绊倒凳子的记忆则显得有些模糊。当她触摸到自己的肘部时，疼痛让她不禁皱眉。没错，那件事确实发生了。

But what about Shinji? The two pilots were furious at each other yesterday morning, now they were naked together, sharing a bed. The whole transition period was a blur – as if someone had taken their finger and smudged Asuka's memory like an oil painting. Now it was barely discernable at all.  
可是，真嗣又如何呢？昨天早晨两位驾驶员还怒目相向，此刻却赤身裸体地同床共枕。整个转变过程如同梦境般模糊不清——仿佛有人用手指将明日香的记忆涂抹得如同油画般模糊，如今已几乎无法辨认。

A terrifying absence loomed in her mind. Even if they hadn't had sex, Asuka was embarrassingly aware of the myriad other possibilities of what two teenagers could accomplish nude. Her hand covered her mouth in horror, dread sinking down upon her like a thousand-pound weight.  
她心中弥漫着一种可怕的空虚感。即使他们未曾发生关系，明日香仍尴尬地意识到，两个青少年赤身裸体时能做的事情还有很多。她惊恐地用手捂住嘴，恐惧如千斤重担般压在心头。

She delicately stepped off the side of her bed, careful not to wake its other occupant, and stepped over to her closet. Quietly, she slipped into some clothes and exited the room.  
她轻手轻脚地从床边下来，生怕吵醒了同床的人，随后走到衣橱前。她悄无声息地穿上衣服，离开了房间。

In the hallway, Asuka made a point to slide the door to Shinji's room closed, just in case Misato wasn't home yet and hadn't seen it open. With the entrance to the vacant room secure, she walked to the bathroom, stepped inside, and locked the door behind her.  
在走廊上，明日香特意将真嗣房间的门关好，以防美里尚未回家，没注意到门是开着的。确认空房间的入口已安全关闭后，她走向浴室，进入并锁上了门。

Asuka immediately collapsed to the floor and buried her face in her knees. Tears welled up in her eyes. She felt sick to her stomach, her head was killing her, and the discovery upon waking had proved overwhelming to her system. She was utterly miserable.  
明日香瞬间倒在地上，脸埋进膝盖，泪水在眼眶中打转。她胃里翻江倒海，头痛得要命，醒来后的发现让她感到难以承受。她陷入了深深的痛苦之中。

Asuka hugged her knees to her chest, shutting out the fluorescent bathroom light. _What happened with Shinji last night? What did I do? What the hell did I say?_ She closed her eyes and thought of the person in her bed. Did she have _any_ memories of him from last night after the shots?  
明日香蜷缩着身体，避开浴室里刺眼的荧光灯。昨晚和真嗣之间发生了什么？自己做了什么？究竟说了些什么？她闭上双眼，脑海中浮现出床上那人的身影。昨晚喝醉之后，她是否还残留着关于他的记忆？

Slowly, hazy images appeared: Shinji looking worried about something, Shinji catching her after she stumbled, she remembered how his hands felt grabbing her waist as she fell, she remembered him...  
渐渐地，朦胧的画面浮现出来：真嗣面露忧色，在她踉跄时及时扶住了她，她回想起他扶住她腰间的手感，她回忆起他……

...did Shinji get in a fight?  
真嗣是不是打架了？

_That's completely ridiculous._ That didn't happen. Must have been a dream.  
那简直是荒谬至极。那件事并未发生。想必是一场梦。

Beyond that, Asuka just associated Shinji of last night with warmth, which wasn't very helpful at all. Alcohol made her feel like she was burning up when she drank too much of it, of course she would be warm.  
除此之外，明日香只是将昨晚的真嗣与温暖联系在一起，但这实际上并没有什么帮助。毕竟，酒精让她在喝多了之后感觉自己像在燃烧，自然会感到温暖。

Regardless, she couldn't face him now. _What day was it, anyway? Sunday?_ Asuka massaged her temple with one of her hands and focused on controlling her breathing.  
无论如何，她此刻无法面对他。今天到底是星期几？星期天吗？明日香用一只手轻揉太阳穴，努力调整呼吸。

This was all wrong. Shinji and her should be watching television right now, eating breakfast, making digs at each other. Laughing. They should be friends. Didn't he realize that she enjoyed the time they spent together? Weren't they friends?  
这一切都错了。真嗣和她现在应该在看电视，吃早餐，互相调侃，笑着。他们应该是朋友。难道他没意识到她享受他们在一起的时光吗？他们不是朋友吗？

_What are we now? 我们现在是什么状态？_

Asuka lurched towards the toilet and vomited.  
明日香蹒跚地走向洗手间，随即呕吐不止。

She was crying in the bathroom when she realized the phone was ringing.  
她在浴室里哭泣时，突然意识到电话铃声响起。

"Get up." 起床了。

Clothing hit Shinji in the face, and he was dragged into consciousness. He sat upright in Asuka's bed, his head screaming at the movement all the way. Shinji focused his eyes with a deal of discomfort.  
衣服猛地打在真嗣脸上，将他惊醒。他直起身坐在明日香的床上，头部因突然的动作而感到剧痛。真嗣努力调整视线，感到颇为不适。

Asuka stood several feet away, scowling at Shinji defiantly. She slipped her red clips back into her hair.  
明日香站在几步之外，挑衅地瞪着真嗣。她将红色发夹重新别回发间。

"We've got sync tests at the Geofront in an hour," she stated flatly. "We leave when you're dressed."  
我们在一小时后要在 Geofront 进行同步测试，"她语气平淡地说，"你准备好我们就出发。

Asuka turned around and exited her room before Shinji could formulate a response. It took several minutes for the hangover to wear off enough for Shinji to realize where exactly he was, and begin to panic.  
明日香转身离开房间，真嗣还没来得及回应。几分钟后，宿醉的晕眩逐渐减轻，真嗣才意识到自己身处何地，随即陷入恐慌。

---

Asuka and Shinji walked down the street side by side, neither one brave enough to meet the other's eyes. Though the silence was deafening, Shinji was glad to see that Asuka had at least stopped trying to avoid him. He had grown tired over the last week of staring at the redhead's back.  
明日香和真嗣肩并肩走在街上，谁也没有勇气直视对方的眼睛。虽然沉默让人难以忍受，但真嗣感到欣慰的是，明日香至少不再躲避他了。过去一周，他一直盯着她的红发背影，已经感到十分疲惫。

_Well, not_ _**all**_ _of her back is so awful to look at..._  
嗯，她的背部并非全都那么难看...

Shinji reddened slightly, but the thought failed to cheer him up. It wasn't the time. Especially in light of waking in her bed unclothed. Shinji chanced a glance over at Asuka, but he found her face inscrutable. _Did she remember anything?_ This was stupid. Things need to be said. Air needed to be cleared right now.  
真嗣的脸颊微微泛红，然而这个念头并未让他感到振奋。此刻并非合适的时机，尤其是考虑到自己赤裸着在她床上醒来的情景。真嗣小心翼翼地瞥向明日香，却发现她的表情深不可测。她是否还记得些什么？这实在荒谬。有些话必须说出口，现在正是澄清误会的时候。

Shinji cleared his throat and spoke. "Um..." The syllable hung in the air between them. Asuka gave no sign of hearing anything. Shinji massaged his head, which still whined in protest at any sound. He grit his teeth and continued.  
真嗣清了清嗓子，开始说话：“嗯……”这个音节在他们之间徘徊。明日香似乎什么也没听到。真嗣揉着还在对声音表示抗议的脑袋，咬紧牙关继续说下去。

"Asuka, I'm going to be honest with you: I don't remember last night at all. How far exactly...? I mean, what... um... did we...?" Shinji swallowed, guiltily. "Did we have-?"  
明日香，我得坦白：昨晚的事我一点印象都没有。具体到什么程度...？我是说，我们...呃...做了什么...？" 真嗣咽了咽口水，带着愧疚说。"我们是不是...？

"No. We didn't." It was the first she had spoken since they left the apartment.  
"不，我们没有。" 这是自他们离开公寓以来她第一次说话。

"Oh..." Shinji breathed a sigh of relief. "That's... really good news." Asuka's eye twitched.  
"哦..." 真嗣松了口气，说道："那...真是好消息。" 明日香的眼角不由得抽搐了一下。

"I'm glad the thought of physical contact with me disgusts you so much," she mumbled.  
“我很高兴你想到和我有身体接触就感到如此厌恶，”她低声说道。

"You know that's not what I meant."  
你明白我的意思不是那样的。

Asuka's brow furrowed darkly. "Uh-huh."  
明日香眉头紧皱，神情阴郁。“嗯哼。”

"Well, look... I'm... I'm actually glad that it didn't happen. It changes things between people, you know?" No response. Shinji swallowed his pride and continued. "But, that aside... look, I don't even know how to begin to apologize for... whatever I did to you. I was drunk, and that's just not-"  
嗯，你看...我...我其实很庆幸那件事没发生。它会影响人与人之间的关系，你明白吗？" 没有回应。真嗣压下自尊，继续说："不过，撇开这个不谈...你看，我甚至不知道怎么为...我对你做的事道歉。我当时喝醉了，那根本不是-

"I don't remember it, either."  
我也记不清了。

"What?" Shinji blinked, thrown off and a little embarrassed. It had taken him the better part of thirty minutes to summon up the courage for that confession. "Hold on, if you don't remember either, then how do you know..?"  
什么？" 真嗣眨了眨眼，感到困惑和有些尴尬。他花了将近三十分钟才鼓起勇气说出那番告白。"等等，如果你也不记得了，那你怎么知道...？

Wait for it. 耐心等待。

"OH."

Shinji finally stopped, the thought proving too surprising for his legs to continue walking. Asuka came to a halt as well, but didn't turn around. She chose instead to face away, towards their destination.  
真嗣终于停下了脚步，这个想法对他来说太过震惊，以至于无法继续前行。明日香也停了下来，但没有转身，而是选择背对着他，面向他们的目的地。

Shinji shuddered. "I'm sorry. I had no idea you were still..." He blushed deeply. "I mean, I guess I'd kind of _assumed_, but..." Shinji decided to let the sentence die in his throat.  
真嗣不禁打了个寒颤。“抱歉，我没想到你还在……”他的脸颊顿时红透了。“我的意思是，我以为你已经……不过……”真嗣决定不再继续这个话题。

"...but what?" ...但究竟是什么呢？

Shinji grimaced. "I don't know, Asuka," he continued, "I mean, you're popular and you're so confident. And I mean, you've been through college already, sometimes part of me had kind of wondered if you'd already... you know..."  
真嗣皱起眉头，说道：“我不清楚，明日香，”他接着说，“我的意思是，你很受欢迎，又那么自信。而且你已经读过大学了，有时候我心里会想，你是不是已经……你知道的……”

"You realize I was twelve when I completed college?"  
“你知不知道，我大学毕业时才十二岁？”

Asuka's voice cut like a knife. Shinji didn't respond.  
明日香的话语尖锐如刀，真嗣沉默不语。

"You're an idiot," Asuka growled. She refused to turn around, shaking with anger. Shinji noticed how tightly her fists were clenched. "You're _such_ an ungodly idiot."  
你真是个白痴，" 明日香怒吼着。她不肯回头，气得浑身颤抖。真嗣注意到她的拳头紧握得厉害。"你简直是个无可救药的白痴。

"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I never really thought that hard about it."  
“瞧，我很抱歉，好吗？我其实没怎么认真考虑过这件事。”

A car passed the two on the road, and Shinji shivered. _That bed had been so warm..._ In front of him, he watched as Asuka's fists slowly unclenched. He couldn't see her face, but when she spoke, her tone lacked its prior spite.  
一辆车从他们身边驶过，真嗣不由得打了个寒颤。那张床曾经是那么温暖……在他面前，他看到明日香的拳头慢慢松开。他看不到她的脸，但当她说话时，语气中已没有了之前的怨恨。

"Look, neither of us remembers last night, right?"  
你看，我们俩都不记得昨晚发生了什么，对吧？

Shinji nodded. "Yes." 真嗣点头道：“是的。”

She sighed, "We didn't have sex, so as far as I'm concerned: nothing happened. We shared a bed. It's happened before, platonically. We'll treat this like we fell asleep on the couch." Asuka turned her head, glancing over her shoulder. "Never talk to me about this again."  
她叹息道：“我们并未发生关系，对我而言，一切如常。我们只是同床而眠。这种事以前也有过，纯粹是精神上的。我们就当作是在沙发上不小心睡着了吧。”明日香回头一瞥，语气坚定：“以后别再跟我提起这件事。”

She turned sharply, walking towards Nerv, and he followed in the prints she left behind her.  
她猛地转身，径直走向 Nerv，而他紧随其后，踩着她留下的足迹。

---

Asuka stuffed her civilian clothes into her locker and pressed the button on her wrist, prompting the plugsuit to let out a puff of air and pull snug against her body. She sighed and stretched the kinks out of her neck on the locker room bench. Her hangover was mercifully ebbing, but Asuka was sure that she'd still get shit from Ritsuko for its adverse effects on her ability to interface with her Evangelion.  
明日香把便服塞进储物柜，按下手腕按钮，紧身衣随即发出一声气响，紧贴身体。她在更衣室的凳子上舒展颈部，缓解僵硬。宿醉正在减轻，但明日香知道，她还是会因为这影响了与 EVA 的连接能力而受到律子的批评。

So there was _that_ to look forward to.  
因此，那是一个值得期待的事情。

Asuka's back cracked. Sync tests were just so boring. She realized they were important, but she just could never summon up the sentiment that it wasn't somehow wasting her time. She sighed. _As long as I don't fall asleep again_. _The way Misato and Shinji go on about it you'd think I was narcoleptic._ She was starting to realize she'd probably never live that down. _It was just one time, for the love of-_  
明日香的背部发出一声脆响。同步测试真是无聊至极。她知道这些测试至关重要，但就是无法让自己觉得这不是在浪费时间。她叹了口气，心想只要别再睡着就好。美里和真嗣对此反应过度，好像她有嗜睡症似的。她渐渐意识到，这个印象恐怕是挥之不去了。那不过就那么一次，真是的——

"Did you sleep with Ikari?"  
你和碇一起睡了吗？

The shock of another voice caused Asuka to nearly fall off the bench. Rei hadn't bothered to give any indication she was going to speak before doing so, and the German had been too lost in her thoughts to notice the other pilot lurking behind her.  
另一个声音的突然出现让明日香差点从长椅上摔下来。丽在说话前没有给出任何即将开口的迹象，而明日香则沉浸在自己的思绪中，没有注意到另一位驾驶员潜伏在她身后。

Asuka whirled. 明日香猛地转过身来。

"Wh-wha? How did you-?" she bit back her words, as to not accidently say anything incriminating. Her mind was doing summersaults under Rei's unforgiving stare. Asuka gathered herself before continuing, embarrassed by her momentary sputter. "Why would you possibly think that?"  
什么？你怎么会-？" 她急忙打住，生怕不小心说出什么对自己不利的话。在丽那不容置疑的目光下，她的思绪翻腾不已。明日香定了定神，继续说道，因刚才的结巴而感到尴尬。"你为什么会这么想？

"You smell like Ikari this morning," Rei stated, simply.  
"你今天早上闻起来有碇的味道，" 绫波淡淡地说。

"_What?_ We're roommates, Wonder Girl! If you live with anyone long enough-"  
什么？我们是室友，神奇女孩！跟任何人住久了——

"And he smelled like you. More than usual."  
“他身上的味道像极了你，甚至比平时还要浓烈。”

"We _live together!_ It happens! I mean, _Scheiße_, take a second and think before you start accusing people of-"  
我们同住一个屋檐下！这很常见！我是说，天哪，先冷静一下，思考清楚再开始指责别人——

"Also, alcohol. Some sweat." Rei's voice held absolute conviction. Asuka was dumbfounded.  
“还有，酒精。一些汗水。” 丽的声音中透露出绝对的自信。明日香完全愣住了。

"Do you always notice how people... smell?" Asuka asked, genuinely a little curious. Rei made no motion to the affirmative, still waiting for an answer to her own question.  
"你有没有注意到人们身上的气味？" 绫波零好奇地问道。她没有给出肯定的回应，依旧在等待自己问题的答案。

_An answer she already knew._ Asuka blushed angrily.  
她早已知晓的答案，让明日香气得脸红。

"There is something wrong with you, Wonder Girl. Really." Asuka stood, slamming her locker door shut. "Talk to Risuko and get your damn head sorted out."  
你确实有问题，神奇女孩。真的。" 明日香站起身，用力关上了储物柜的门。"去找理子聊聊，把你的思绪整理清楚。

"Do you like Ikari?" 你喜欢伊卡里吗？

Asuka stopped dead. 明日香猛地停了下来。

"Romantically," Rei clarified.  
"从浪漫的角度来看，" 丽解释道。

The German's head tilted slightly downwards as Rei waited patiently. Asuka clenched her teeth. She hated Rei, partially because of petty jealousy (Asuka considered Rei prettier than herself, and was admittedly envious of the other girl's more generously proportioned body) and partially because try as she might, Asuka just didn't _get_ her. She could never comprehend what Rei was thinking. It was as if the two spoke entirely different languages, which were translated between them by someone who spoke neither one very deftly. This was Rei's fault, of course. _Why couldn't she just act like a normal person?_  
德国人的头微微低垂，丽耐心地等待着。明日香咬紧牙关，心中对丽充满了厌恶。这种厌恶一部分源自于她的小嫉妒——她觉得丽比自己更漂亮，而且丽的身材也更加丰满，这让她心生羡慕；另一部分则是因为她无论如何努力，都无法理解丽的想法。两人的思维仿佛是两种截然不同的语言，而他们之间的沟通就像是由一个对这两种语言都不甚精通的人在翻译。这一切，当然都被明日香归咎于丽。她不禁想问，为什么丽就不能表现得像一个普通人那样呢？

Rei was still waiting. 丽依然在等候。

"..._why_?" Asuka hissed. “...为什么？”明日香低声问道。

"I am curious." Her voice was honest. Asuka wondered if Rei ever lied. She sighed heavily.  
"我很好奇。" 她的声音透露出真诚。明日香不禁思索，绫波是否也会说谎。她重重地叹了口气。

"What does it matter?" 这有什么大不了的？

"It doesn't," Ayanami confessed, "but I'm curious, nonetheless. Did you sleep together?" Asuka felt a spike of anger. She found Rei's directness infuriating.  
绫波坦言：“没有，但我还是很好奇。你们一起睡过吗？”明日香感到一阵愤怒。她觉得绫波的直率令人恼火。

Glancing over her shoulder at the blue haired girl, Asuka snarled, "We didn't fuck, if that's what you're asking."  
阿斯卡回头瞥了一眼蓝发女孩，咆哮道：“我们没上床，如果这是你想问的。”

"It wasn't," Rei said, meeting her gaze calmly. Asuka averted her eyes, embarrassed at her sudden outburst. "I'll rephrase the question," Rei continued, "Do you have feelings for Ikari-kun?"  
不是那样的，" 丽平静地对视着她，说道。明日香有些尴尬地避开了目光，对自己的冲动感到不好意思。"我换个方式问，" 丽接着说，"你对碇君有感情吗？

Silence. 静默无声。

Asuka waited a long time before saying anything at all. When her voice emerged, it was in the faintest of whispers.  
明日香沉默良久，终于开口，声音却细如蚊呐。

Rei heard her answer, and nodded.  
丽听到了她的回答，随即点头表示理解。

"I see," she said simply.  
“我明白了，”她简洁地说道。

Asuka turned towards Rei, searching for some kind of connection, forgiveness, an absolution of any kind. This secret was a truth Asuka could hardly even admit to herself. She had never told anybody; only Rei. She suddenly became aware of how vulnerable she felt.  
明日香转向丽，试图寻找某种联系、宽恕，或是任何形式的赦免。这个秘密是明日香几乎无法向自己承认的真相。她从未向任何人透露过；只有丽知道。她突然意识到自己感到多么脆弱。

For her part, Rei's face was utterly blank. After a moment, she opened her mouth, and softly spoke.  
至于丽，她的面容一片空白。片刻后，她启唇轻语。

"You are not alone." 你不是一个人。

For the first time in her life, Asuka felt true warmth towards the other girl. She briefly saw herself and Rei for what they were: two people in the same fire. _You are not alone._._._ Asuka smiled.  
在她的生命里，明日香首次对另一个女孩产生了真切的温情。她瞬间意识到自己和丽不过是同处一团火焰中的两个人。你并非孤身一人……明日香露出了微笑。

"Well, let's not get all _mushy_ about it."  
“好了，我们别太情绪化了。”

Summarily ignoring her, Rei walked past Asuka and out of the locker room, towards the loading bays. The annoyance flooded back.  
丽匆匆无视明日香，径直走过并离开了更衣室，向装载区走去。心中的恼怒再次涌起。

'_Mushy' from The First Child._ _**Right**__._  
《第一个孩子》里的“泥泞”。没错。

Asuka tossed her hair and followed after the other girl.  
明日香甩了甩头发，紧随另一个女孩之后。

---

"What's she doing?" 她正在做什么？

"Asuka-chan?" 明日香，是你吗？

"Yes," Ritsuko pointed to the picture of the girl on the monitor. "Look. These readings are..."  
是的，" 律子指着屏幕上女孩的图像说。"看，这些数据是...

"...garbage." Misato completed her sentence. The women sat apart from the rest of the team in the monitoring station, allowing them to have the correct amount of privacy for candid conversations. Below them, and through the glass, the three entry plugs lay silent. Misato stood, slightly worried. "...is she asleep again?"  
...真是乱七八糟。" 美里说完这句话。她和那位女士在监控站中与其他队员保持一定距离，以便能有足够的私密空间进行坦率的交流。透过下方的玻璃，可以看到三个插入栓静静地停在那里。美里站起身，脸上带着一丝忧虑。"...她是不是又睡着了？

Ritsuko smirked, bringing up another monitor. "I don't think so. But, still the reading is... _abysmal._ Everything seems to be working, too." She took off her glasses, massaging the area between her eyes. "The trouble is with the pilot. How bizarre. This isn't like her at all."  
理津子冷笑一声，又调出一个监视器。“我不这么认为。但读数仍然……糟糕透顶。一切似乎都在正常运作。”她摘下眼镜，揉了揉眼间的部位。“问题出在驾驶员身上。真是奇怪。这完全不像她。”

"Could it be something on her mind?" Misato offered. Ritsuko shrugged.  
"她是不是心里有事呢？" 美里猜测道。律子只是耸了耸肩。

"Perhaps. If so, it would have to be really bothering her. Commanding most of her attention." Ritsuko glanced sideways at her friend. "Any ideas what _that_ might be?"  
也许是的。如果真是如此，那必定是件让她极为烦恼的事，几乎占据了她的全部心思。" 律子斜眼瞥向她的朋友，问道："你有什么头绪吗，那会是什么事呢？

The lines in Misato's face deepened, and she shook her head to the negative. She sighed, regretfully. "I haven't been home much." Misato paused briefly, thinking. "...but she _did_ go on a date the other night." She looked knowingly at Ritsuko. Ritsuko exhaled, replacing her glasses on her face.  
美里脸上的皱纹显得更深了，她摇头表示否定。她遗憾地叹了口气，说道：“我最近很少回家。”美里稍作停顿，若有所思。“……不过她前几晚确实去约会了。”她意味深长地看向律子。律子轻叹一声，重新戴上了眼镜。

"Why don't you take the call privately?"  
你为何不私下接听这个电话呢？

"Yeah, good idea." Misato slipped on the earpiece and, walking over to the intercom, she opened the channel to Unit 02. "Asuka?"  
对，好主意。" 美里戴上耳机，走向对讲机，接通了二号机的频道。"明日香？

The pilot's eyes flicked open on the monitor.  
飞行员的双眼在监控屏幕上突然睁开。

"How're you feeling today? Anything you'd like to talk about?"  
你今天感觉如何？有什么想谈的吗？

Asuka thought carefully before responding. She leaned her head to the side, disappointment etched into her features. "...the readings are low, aren't they?"  
明日香深思熟虑后才作出回应。她微微侧头，脸上明显带着失望的表情。“……数据显示很低，是吗？”

"Don't worry about that right now. Let's just talk." Misato was concerned, but didn't want to overplay it. She had lived with the German girl long enough to know that few things in the world made Asuka angrier than to feel someone was coddling her. Misato knew she had to talk about the date, but she should start small. _Something insignificant._ _Chit-chat._ She cleared her throat. "I've been so busy in the office lately I feel like I've barely seen you guys. What did you and Shinji end up doing last night?"  
现在先别担心那件事。我们聊聊吧。" 美里虽然关心，但不想表现得太明显。她与那位德国女孩同住已久，深知世上能让明日香更生气的事不多，其中之一就是感觉有人在过度呵护她。美里明白必须提及约会的事，但她决定先从轻松的话题入手，聊些无关紧要的事。她清了清嗓子，问道："最近我在办公室忙得团团转，感觉都没怎么见到你们。昨晚你和真嗣都做了些什么？

Asuka stared off into space, not answering for quite some time. Misato's brow furrowed. _Did she hear me?_ She was about to repeat the question when Asuka spoke: "We watched TV," she swallowed. "It was boring, really. Late night programming is so terrible."  
明日香目光远眺，久久未作回应。美里眉头紧锁。她是否听见了我的话？正欲重复提问之际，明日香缓缓开口：“我们看了电视，”她顿了顿，“内容乏味至极。深夜时段的节目质量实在堪忧。”

Misato raised her eyebrows, studying the girl's face on the screen. _She's lying._ "Wasn't there a blackout last night?"  
美里挑了挑眉，认真审视着屏幕上女孩的面容。她显然在撒谎。“昨晚不是发生了停电吗？”

"Yeah. It was later, though. Around three."  
“嗯，不过那是在三点左右。”

"I see," Misato continued. "That sounds fun, though. Were you warm enough? It's been so freezing-"  
我明白了，"美里接着说，"听起来挺有趣的。不过，你穿得够暖吗？最近天气一直很冷——

"I was fine. It wasn't that cold."  
我没事，天气并不算冷。

_Huh._

Misato's curiosity was piqued, but she knew when she was being shut out. Right now, Asuka was a closed door. Pushing further would only serve to make her angry. This would just have to wait.  
美里虽然好奇心被勾起，但她明白自己正被排斥在外。眼下，明日香就像一扇紧闭的大门，再继续追问只会让她生气。这件事只能暂时放下。

She sighed, pressing the button to talk.  
她轻叹一声，按下了通话按钮。

"Well, that's good," she said. "Look, your readings are a little low. Maybe we could increase the LCL concentration a little? Just to see if it will help with the interface at all."  
“嗯，那很好，”她说。“看，你的读数有点低。也许我们可以稍微增加一下 LCL 浓度？只是看看它是否会对界面有所帮助。”

"No. Don't." 不，别这么做。

"Ritsuko's been wanting to try and test it out. Might come in handy in battle if we're ever in a tight spot."  
理津子一直想尝试并测试这个。如果在战斗中遇到紧急情况，它可能会很有用。

"I don't need a handicap." Asuka grimaced. "I'm sorry, I'll concentrate harder." She closed her eyes. Misato sighed.  
"我不需要特殊照顾。" 明日香皱着眉头说，"抱歉，我会更加专注的。" 她闭上了双眼。美里叹息了一声。

"Try your best, Asuka-chan." She clicked off the intercom and took the earpiece off, crossing her arms.  
"加油，明日香。" 她关闭了对讲机，取下耳机，双手抱胸。

Ritsuko turned to her superior. "Orders?"  
理津子转向她的上司，询问道：“有什么指示吗？”

Misato weighed her options.  
美里仔细考虑了她的选择。

"Do it. Slowly," she shrugged. "What Asuka doesn't know won't hurt her pride, and if this works, it might just come in handy down the line. She probably won't even notice." Misato turned to Ritsuko, winking. "Our little secret?"  
慢慢来，" 她耸耸肩说，"绫波不知道的事不会伤到她的自尊，如果这招有效，将来或许能派上用场。她可能根本不会察觉。" 美里转向律子，眨了眨眼，"我们的小秘密？

Ritsuko smiled. "Naturally."  
理津子微笑着说：“这是自然。”

And it was done. 事情已经办妥了。

---

Asuka often thought of the LCL as a hot bath. Truth be told, there was something about its temperature and consistency that just felt soothing to her. She inhaled through her nose and let it permeate her being. Asuka felt weightless.  
明日香常将 LCL 比作热腾腾的泡澡，其温度与质地确实带给她一种抚慰感。她深吸一口气，任由这感觉充盈全身，仿佛卸下了所有重负。

_Why do I feel so fuzzy?  
为何我感到如此模糊不清？_

Asuka opened her eyes, looking towards the front of her cockpit. Curious, she pressed her fingers together.  
明日香睁开双眼，目光投向驾驶舱前方。她带着好奇心，轻轻地按了按手指。

_Have they always felt like that?_ She tilted her head. _I wonder what they felt last night..._  
他们是否一直都有这样的感觉？她歪着头思索。真想知道他们昨晚经历了什么...

Asuka angrily shook her head, closing her eyes tightly. _Stop it! Concentrate on the test._ _**Concentrate**__. Clear your stupid head and don't worry about what happened-_  
明日香气愤地摇着头，紧闭双眼。别再想了！专心考试。集中注意力。抛开那些无谓的思绪，别再去纠结已经发生的事——

And then suddenly it was there. The memory. Everything she had wanted to know. Every sensation she had felt, every decision she had made poured into her mind like a deluge, and the emotions were overwhelming.  
然后突然间，记忆浮现了。她一直渴望了解的一切，她所经历的每一种感受，她所做出的每一个决定，都如洪水般涌入她的心海，情感之强烈令人难以承受。

Asuka choked back a sob, and realized she was crying. _He said... we didn't..._  
明日香强忍住哽咽，意识到自己正在流泪。他说...我们并没有...

She turned towards Unit 01's test plug and clicked the button to open a channel.  
她转向 01 号机的测试插头，按下按钮开启了通信频道。

"Shinji-" 真嗣——

But that was all Asuka had time to say, because that was when the Angel attacked.  
但明日香只来得及说出这些，因为就在那时，使徒发动了攻击。

---

When Shinji fell onto the bed, Asuka landed on top of him. He grunted under the weight of her body, and she laughed at the unexpected noise.  
真嗣倒在床上时，明日香正好压在他身上。他因她的重量而闷哼一声，她则被这突如其来的声音逗笑了。

"Sorry," she whispered. "Are you okay?"  
“抱歉，”她轻声问道，“你还好吗？”

"Yeah, don't worry." 嗯，不用担心。

"Good," Asuka leaned in and kissed Shinji again, prompting his arms to loop around her back and hold her steady.  
"好，" 明日香靠近再次亲吻真嗣，他的双臂随即环抱她的背部，稳稳地拥住她。

Shinji realized he had never been on Asuka's bed before. The western bed was definitely softer than the futon he was used to lying down on in the next room, and the sheets smelled just like she did. He had caught whiffs of Asuka's scent here and there, enough to identify it as its own unique (and distinctly intoxicating) construct, but he had never been so engulfed in it. It felt intimate – like a secret only he knew, a place only he'd been. He liked the feeling. Asuka's hands pulled off his shirt.  
真嗣意识到自己从未躺过明日香的床。这张西式床比他在隔壁房间习惯的蒲团要柔软得多，床单上散发着她特有的香气。他曾在不同地方嗅到过明日香的气息，足以辨识出那独特的、令人沉醉的味道，但他从未如此深陷其中。这种感觉很亲密，仿佛这是一个只有他知晓的秘密之地。他很喜欢这种感觉。明日香的手轻轻脱下了他的衬衫。

"I'm glad I didn't hurt you. I hate it when you get hurt," she admitted, trailing kisses gently down the side of Shinji's face. "I think you're really brave, honestly."  
“幸好我没伤到你。我不愿看到你受伤，”她坦诚地说，温柔地吻着真嗣的脸颊。“说真的，我觉得你非常勇敢。”

"...really?" ...真的吗？

She laughed, embarrassed. "God, um... could you forget I just said that? I must sound like such an idiot right now. I'll shut up."  
她尴尬地笑了笑，说：“天啊，呃……你能当我没说过那句话吗？我现在肯定听起来像个傻瓜。我会保持沉默的。”

"It's okay," Shinji laughed with her. Alcohol really _did_ make people more honest. A sober Asuka would never have told him that. "Honestly, I don't think you sound stupid at-"  
没事的，" 真嗣笑着附和道。酒精确实让人更坦诚。清醒时的明日香绝不会对他说这些。"说真的，我不觉得你说话听起来很蠢-

She planted her lips on his neck and gently applied suction. Shinji gasped at the sensation. Asuka's hands navigated to his belt.  
她将双唇轻贴在他的脖颈，温柔地吮吸着。真嗣因这突如其来的感觉而屏息。与此同时，明日香的手悄然探向他的腰带。

"No! Nononono, okay, this has to stop."  
不！不行，不行，不行，好了，这得停下来。

He squirmed out from her arms and sat up. Shinji's eyes were beginning to adjust to the darkness. He could just make out the outline of the German in the gloom, on the edge of her bed. She brushed hair behind her ear and tilted her head at him.  
他从她的臂弯中扭动着挣脱，坐了起来。真嗣的眼睛逐渐适应了黑暗，勉强能看清那个德国人的轮廓，就在她的床沿。她将头发轻轻拨到耳后，微微侧头看向他。

"Was that... bad?" she asked meekly. "I haven't had any practice..."  
那...是不是很糟糕？" 她怯生生地问道，"我一点练习都没有...

"No! I mean..." Shinji turned deep crimson. "I-it felt wonderful. That's not the problem, it's just that..." He took a second to gather himself, groping for words in his slight haze of drink. "We shouldn't do this. You're drunk."  
不！我是说……" 真嗣的脸变得通红。"我感觉很美妙。这不是问题，只是……" 他稍作停顿，试图在微醺的状态下找到合适的言辞。"我们不该这么做。你已经醉了。

"But... I want to." Asuka smiled. "I mean, I really do. I have for the longest time. Do you not?"  
“可是……我真的很想去。”明日香笑着说，“我是说，我确实一直都很想去。你难道不想吗？”

No answer. 未作答。

She moved her hand over his. "Don't you think I'm pretty?"  
她将手轻轻覆在他的手上，问道：“难道你不觉得我挺美的吗？”

Shinji gulped, "That's unfair."  
真嗣咽了咽口水，说道：“那样不公平。”

"Don't you?" 不是吗？

"...of course I do." ...当然，我会这么做。

"Then what's the problem?" Asuka leaned in to kiss him again, but this time Shinji jerked away.  
"那到底是什么问题呢？" 明日香再次靠近想要亲吻他，但这次真嗣却避开了。

"Will you just listen? For once, _please_ just listen to me!" It stopped her. Shinji sighed. "Asuka, I... we're drunk. Honestly, I can barely even process what's happening right now, I'm so tired. I just..."  
你能听我说一次吗？请听我说！" 她停了下来。真嗣叹了口气。"明日香，我...我们现在都醉了。说实话，我现在累得连正在发生什么都几乎无法理解。我只是...

He searched for words. Trying to think was like wading through wet sand. His brain felt clogged and unresponsive. Finally, he shook his head, at a loss.  
他努力寻找合适的词汇，但思考起来就像在湿漉漉的沙地上艰难前行。他的大脑似乎被堵塞，反应迟缓。最终，他只能无奈地摇了摇头，感到无计可施。

"...I really like you," he said, simply. "I really, really do. I have for a long time, I think. And if it has to be like this, then I don't want it. I'm sorry."  
...我真的喜欢你，" 他坦率地说，"我真的很喜欢你。我想已经很久了。如果事情必须如此，那我宁愿不要。我很抱歉。

There was just enough light to make out Asuka's genuinely injured expression. She averted her gaze to the floor.  
光线刚好足够看清明日香那受伤的真实表情。她避开了视线，看向地面。

"Let's just wait, okay?" Shinji offered. "Let's sleep it off, and then maybe tomorrow-"  
我们稍等一下，好吗？" 真嗣建议道，"先休息一下，或许明天再处理——

"You know that won't happen," she said bitterly. "Don't be naïve."  
“你知道那不可能发生，”她痛苦地说道，“别太天真了。”

"Why not, Asuka?" 为什么不行呢，明日香？

For a moment, there was no reply. Just as Shinji was beginning to suspect that Asuka had fallen asleep sitting up, he heard a soft sniffling. Her hand quickly shot up and rubbed away the liquid that had started to spill over. She turned her face further away so he couldn't see her crying, and Shinji felt his heart breaking. Sliding over next to her on the bed, Shinji moved to put his arm around her shoulder, but Asuka smacked his it away, looking up to face him.  
片刻间，无人应答。就在真嗣开始怀疑明日香是否坐着睡着时，他听到了轻微的抽泣声。她迅速抬起手，擦去溢出的泪水。她将脸转向更远处，不让真嗣看到她的哭泣，这让真嗣感到心痛。他挪到床边靠近她，想要伸手揽住她的肩膀，但明日香却拍开了他的手，抬头直视着他。

"You know why it won't happen!" she yelled. "B-because I'm me, and you're _you_ and we _can't_! Don't you understand?" Asuka angrily wiped away the tears streaming down her cheeks. "We're Evangelion pilots! We can die any time an Angel attacks! We can't think about things like this! We can't _like_ each other like that! We can't fall in love!" She calmed down a little, sniffing, and her eyes drifted to the left. "I can't fall in love with anyone... I'm not supposed to..."  
你知道为什么不会发生！" 她喊道。"因为我是我，你是你，我们不能！你不懂吗？" 明日香生气地擦去脸颊上流下的泪水。"我们是 EVA 驾驶员！天使攻击时我们随时可能死去！我们不能考虑这种事！我们不能那样喜欢对方！我们不能坠入爱河！" 她稍微平静了一些，吸了吸鼻子，目光转向左边。"我不能爱上任何人...我不应该...

Silent sobs shook her frame and Asuka finally let Shinji wrap his arms around her. Collapsing onto the bed, she cried into his chest.  
无声的抽泣使她全身颤抖，明日香终于允许真嗣拥她入怀。她倒在床上，埋首于他的胸膛哭泣。

"What would I do if something happened to you, baka? Do you think I would be able to fight if all I was doing was thinking about your safety? I wouldn't even be able to pilot, anymore! What can I do if I don't pilot? I've got nothing else!" Asuka desperately clutched at Shinji, her nails digging into his back. He grit his teeth at the sting, but he refused to let go. One hand gently stroked her hair, attempting to sooth his crying friend. For a long time, Shinji held her in the dark and allowed Asuka her catharsis.  
"要是你出了什么事，我该怎么办呢，傻瓜？你以为我满心都是你的安危，还能专心战斗吗？我连驾驶都做不到！如果不能驾驶，我还能做什么？我别无选择！" 明日香绝望地紧紧抓住真嗣，指甲深深嵌入他的背部。他咬紧牙关忍住疼痛，却不愿松手。一只手温柔地抚摸着她的头发，试图安抚这位哭泣的朋友。在黑暗中，真嗣长时间地拥抱着她，任由她宣泄情绪。

Eventually, the German eased her grip on him and her breathing calmed.  
最终，那位德国人逐渐松开了对他的控制，她的呼吸也恢复了平静。

"But... but if it were like this..." Asuka continued, softly. "If we were both like this... then it's almost like it's not real, right? Here in the dark? Drunk. It's almost like a dream. We probably won't even remember this in the morning. We can do whatever we want." Asuka looked up at him. "Nothing has to change." She attempted a smile and reached up to touch the hand Shinji was running through her hair. "I don't want things to change."  
但是...但如果情况是这样..." 明日香轻声继续，"如果我们俩都这样...那感觉就不太真实了，对吧？在这黑暗中？喝醉了。这几乎像是一场梦。我们可能早上都不会记得这件事。我们可以做任何我们想做的事。" 明日香抬头看着他，"什么都不需要改变。" 她试图微笑，并伸手去触摸真嗣在她头发上抚摸的手，"我不想事情改变。

Shinji shook his head. "Everything changes, Asuka. It already has."  
真嗣摇摇头说：“一切都在变，明日香，已经变了。”

The remnants of tears silently slid down her cheeks, staining her pillow. Turning her face, she gently kissed his palm. "...yeah, I know. But this is like a dream, right? We don't have to wake up yet."  
泪痕悄然滑落，染湿了枕巾。她侧过脸，轻吻他的掌心，低语道：“……是的，我明白。但这宛如梦境，不是吗？我们尚不必醒来。”

"Asuka, I don't want to have-"  
明日香，我不希望拥有——

"I don't either," Asuka turned and looked Shinji in the eyes. "You're right. This isn't the way I want it. And I want you to know while I'm still conscious that I think it's incredibly sweet that you stopped me. Not many guys would have." Leaning up, she tenderly kissed his lips. "Thank you. It means the world to me."  
我也不想，" 明日香转过身，直视着真嗣的眼睛说，"你说得对，这不是我想要的方式。我想让你知道，在我还清醒的时候，我觉得你阻止我真是太好了。没有多少男生会这么做。" 她轻轻地吻了他的唇，"谢谢你，这对我意义重大。

Shinji smiled, but his fatigue made him yawn. "What do you mean then? About not 'waking up'?"  
真嗣虽然笑了，但疲惫使他忍不住打了个哈欠。“那么，你说的‘不醒来’究竟是什么意思呢？”

"Will you stay with me? Until morning?" Asuka was genuinely asking again. Shinji knew that if he wanted to, he could get up and leave. He thought back to the first blackout at the apartment, when Asuka had tried to affirm their friendship. She had offered him an opportunity and he had turned her away. This whole mess had been caused due to his callousness. _Never again._  
"你会陪我到天亮吗？" 明日香再次真挚地询问。真嗣明白，如果他想走，他完全可以起身离开。他回忆起公寓的第一次停电，那时明日香试图确认他们的友情。她给了他机会，他却拒绝了。这一切麻烦都源于他的冷漠。绝不会再有下次。

He nodded his head. "Of course I will."  
他点头表示同意。“我当然会这么做。”

Asuka smiled at him. "Good." Swallowing, she asked meekly: "Will you help me get my bra off? I can't sleep with it on."  
明日香朝他微微一笑，说道：“很好。”她吞了吞口水，轻声问道：“你能帮我解开胸罩吗？穿着它我睡不着。”

Shinji had the presence of mind to still turn a little red, but he nodded nonetheless.  
尽管如此，真嗣仍能保持镇定，脸上微微泛红，但他还是点了点头。

They sat up in the bed. Silently, Asuka slid the sync-clips out of her hair and placed them on her bedside table. She gathered her hair in her hands and pulled it to the side, exposing her bare back to the other pilot. When there was a moment's pause, she encouraged him: "Go ahead."  
他们坐在床上。明日香默默地从头发中取出同步夹，放在床头柜上。她将头发拢起并拉向一侧，露出裸露的背部给另一位驾驶员。在短暂的停顿后，她鼓励道：“继续吧。”

"Um... I'm not sure I know how," Shinji admitted. Asuka laughed.  
“呃……我不太确定自己是否知道该怎么做，”真嗣坦白说。明日香笑了起来。

"The clasp is in the middle. Squeeze it together until it unhooks." She smiled to herself. "Man, you really _haven't_ done this before."  
扣子位于中间位置，用力挤压直至松开。" 她心中暗笑，"看来你确实没经验啊。

"Sorry." Shinji did as instructed, and the garment unclasped. Asuka slid it off of her shoulders and let it drop to the floor on the side of the bed in front of her. Keeping her back to him, she lay down in the bed and pulled the sheets to her neck.  
"抱歉。" 真嗣按照指示做了，衣服的扣子解开了。明日香将它从肩膀上褪下，任其落在床前的一侧地板上。她背对着他，躺到床上，并将床单拉至颈部。

Some rustling later, Asuka's pants disappeared over the side. "You can undress if you want," she said, "I can never get comfortable sleeping with clothes on." And with that proclamation, she lay still.  
片刻之后，随着一阵窸窣声，明日香的长裤从床边滑落。“如果你想，可以脱掉衣服，”她轻声说道，“我总觉得穿着衣服睡觉不舒服。”话音刚落，她便静静地躺下了。

Shinji gulped. He was almost positive he had seen Asuka sleep clothed before. _Was this a test?_ After a brief, intense mental debate, he figured he should probably follow suit, seeing as how they were to share a bed. _That was what she wanted, right?_ Even drunk, Asuka was hard to predict, and if an angry sober Asuka was a sight to behold, Shinji could scarcely imagine her less-inhibited counterpart. If she was going to sleep naked, he'd better do the same, in the interest of living through the next ten minutes. Nervous, he stripped off what remained of his clothing and lay down next to his friend.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，几乎可以肯定自己曾见过明日香穿着衣服睡觉。这是不是一种考验？经过一番短暂而激烈的思想斗争，他觉得既然两人要共用一张床，自己也应该效仿。这正是她所期望的，不是吗？即便在醉酒状态下，明日香的不可预测性依旧，而清醒时愤怒的她已让人难以直视，更不用说她放纵时的模样了。如果明日香打算裸睡，为了确保自己能安然度过接下来的十分钟，真嗣决定也脱掉衣服，紧张地躺在了她的身旁。

Shinji stayed still as he possibly could at the opposite end of the bed, staring at the ceiling, so as not to wake Asuka. Soon, he felt sleep creeping up on him.  
真嗣尽量保持静止，躺在床的另一头，凝视着天花板，以免吵醒明日香。很快，他感到睡意悄然袭来。

"Hold me, you idiot." 抱紧我，你这傻瓜。

He woke from his light dozing and shuffled over next to her. Tentatively, he wrapped his arms around Asuka and hugged her. Her skin was soft and warm and perfectly smooth. Asuka settled in, enjoying the sensation of their shared touch. She sighed happily and let her body mold into his.  
他从轻浅的打盹中醒来，缓缓挪步到她身旁。小心翼翼地，他张开双臂环抱住明日香。她的肌肤柔软而温暖，完美无瑕。明日香舒适地依偎着，沉浸在两人肌肤相亲的愉悦中。她满足地叹息，身体自然而然地与他相拥。

"Shinji?" she asked. "真嗣？" 她轻声问道。

"Mmm?" Shinji felt himself falling asleep again.  
"嗯？" 真嗣觉得自己快要再次入睡了。

"We're not going to remember this when we wake up, are we?"  
我们醒来时不会记得这件事，对吗？

"Probably not," he mumbled, darkness already invading his vision. "Why?"  
“大概不会，”他低声说道，黑暗正逐渐占据他的视线。“怎么了？”

"I really like you, too," she whispered, "and I have since we met."  
“我也很喜欢你，”她轻声说道，“自从我们相遇以来，我就一直这样觉得。”

Shinji smiled. He nestled his nose in Asuka's hair, and let himself be swept away.  
真嗣微微一笑，将鼻子埋入明日香的秀发中，任由自己沉浸在这份温柔之中。

"Unit Zero is out of commission! Rei is down!"  
零号单位已失效！雷伊已经倒下！

Asuka felt a twinge of panic, which she shoved down under her consciousness. _This is battle. This is what you were born for. Panic later._ She gripped the controls of her Evangelion and raised her gun to shoot.  
明日香感到一丝慌乱，但她迅速将其压制在意识深处。这就是战斗，她生来就是为了这一刻。先别慌，她紧握 EVA 的操纵杆，举枪瞄准，准备射击。

Chatter kept coming in from the radio.  
无线电中持续传来嘈杂的对话声。

"Status on the pilot?" 试点的进展怎么样了？

"She's unconscious, but she doesn't seem to be seriously hurt."  
她虽然失去了意识，但似乎并没有受到严重的伤害。

"Get her out of there as quickly as possible," Asuka recognized Commander Katsuragi's voice. Her and the Misato of home were worlds apart. _Two people. Same face_.  
"尽快把她带出来，"明日香辨认出这是葛城司令的声音。她和家中的美里截然不同。两人虽面容相同，却是截然不同的存在。

Asuka fired at the Angel.  
明日香向使徒开枪射击。

It had four limbs of varying size, and was ostensibly bipedal, but Asuka couldn't quite make out exactly what parts of the creature were vital. It could certainly regenerate limbs. Rei had been caught unawares when the arm she had just blown off of the Angel erupted from the severed stump back into her face.  
这个生物拥有四条大小不一的肢体，表面上看似双足行走，但明日香难以确定其关键部位。它显然具备肢体再生的能力。绫波零在炸断使徒手臂的瞬间，那条断臂竟从残肢中猛然喷出，直击她的面部，令她措手不及。

Cut off one leg and it would grow right back. It was like a starfish, only faster and ten stories tall. Asuka's shots tore through the center of the animal, to minimal effect. Flesh filled in where her rounds had hit within seconds.  
即使切断一条腿，它也能迅速再生，宛如海星，但速度更快，高达十层楼。明日香的子弹穿透了这只巨兽的中心，却几乎未造成伤害。弹孔处，血肉在眨眼间便愈合如初。

_Where the hell is the core?  
核心究竟在哪里？_

The gun clicked empty and Asuka tossed it to the ground. In her peripheral vision, she saw Shinji ready his knife.  
枪声空响，明日香随手将其抛掷于地。她眼角余光瞥见真嗣已握紧了手中的刀。

"I'm out of ammunition," his voice crackled over the intercom between the vehicles. Asuka chanced a glance down at the ordinance at her feet: three guns were left near her, probably a magazine left in each one. _Not enough._ The twinge of panic was back. She grabbed another gun. _Two left._  
"我的弹药已经耗尽，"他的声音在对讲机中沙哑地传来。明日香瞥了一眼脚边的武器：她身边还剩下三把枪，可能每把枪里还剩一个弹匣。这远远不够。恐慌的感觉再次袭来。她又拿起一把枪。现在只剩下两把了。

"Misato, we need more ammo up here," Asuka was running out of places on the Angel to shoot. "**Now**."  
美里，我们这里急需补充弹药，"明日香发现使徒身上可供射击的部位越来越有限。"马上。

"Three minutes, Asuka." Misato replied. "We're loading it right-"  
三分钟，明日香。" 美里回答说，"我们正在加载——

Suddenly, the Angel lifted off the ground and began to spin like a top. With momentum gained, it touched its spinning feet back onto the ground and pinwheeled across the landscape towards the silent Unit Zero.  
突然间，天使腾空而起，开始像陀螺般旋转。随着动力的增强，它用旋转的双脚再次触地，如同风车一般疾速穿越静谧的零号单位。

"It's going for Rei!" Shinji yelled. "Asuka, cover me!"  
它正冲向丽！" 真嗣大声喊道。"明日香，掩护我！

"Shinji, wait!" Asuka cried, but it was too late. His feet kicked up trees on the hills as he ran towards the Angel. She grit her teeth. "Damn you!"  
真嗣，等等！" 明日香喊道，但为时已晚。他向使徒奔去，脚下的树木在山丘上扬起尘土。她咬紧牙关，愤愤地说："该死的！

Asuka raised her gun and fired at the spinning legs, whittling off bits of the animal, desperately trying to slow it down. Chunks of flesh and blood rained down on the hills around Tokyo-3. The Angel was slowed, but not halted.  
明日香举枪射击，试图削减那旋转的腿部，拼命减缓其速度。肉块与血雨纷纷落下，覆盖了第三新东京市周边的山丘。天使虽被减缓，却未曾停下。

Asuka's gun clicked empty. The Angel was within a dozen meters of Rei when Shinji intercepted it, tackling it to the ground with his knife.  
明日香的枪响起了空膛声。当天使距离绫波仅剩十几米时，真嗣冲上前去，用刀将其扑倒在地。

The reaction was violent and immediate. The Angel lost interest in Rei entirely. The four appendages multiplied, tangling themselves around Shinji. Shinji began to hack at the alien appendages like thick vines with his knife.  
反应异常激烈且迅速。天使对绫波彻底失去了兴趣。四条触手迅速增多，紧紧缠绕住真嗣。真嗣则挥刀猛砍这些如同粗壮藤蔓般的外星触手。

Asuka gasped, grabbing the remaining two guns and firing sporadically into the thicket, trying desperately not to hit Shinji. She watched helplessly as he disappeared under the torrent of the Angel's multiplying limbs.  
明日香惊呼一声，急忙抓起剩下的两把枪，向灌木丛中胡乱开火，竭力避免误伤真嗣。她眼睁睁地看着他淹没在天使那不断增殖的肢体洪流中。

Panic. Unadulterated panic.  
恐慌至极。纯粹的恐慌。

_No! No, no, stop it! You're killing him!  
不要！停下，停下，你在害他！_

A voice over the comm: "Something's emerging from its back!"  
通讯器中传来声音：“它背上有什么东西正在出现！”

A crimson sphere began to bubble to the surface on the Angel's back. _The core!_ Asuka aimed both guns for the emerging core and pulled the triggers. Bullets bit into the red pool, prompting a howl of pain, but nothing else.  
一个深红色的球体开始在天使的背部浮现，那是核心！明日香双枪齐发，瞄准那逐渐显现的核心扣动扳机。子弹射入那片红色区域，随即传来一声痛苦的嚎叫，然而除此之外，再无其他动静。

"What's happening?" Asuka screamed. "Why isn't it working?" The creature tilted on to the ground, Shinji long since disappeared from sight.  
"出什么事了？" 明日香尖叫着。"为什么它失灵了？" 那生物倾斜着倒在地上，真嗣早已消失无踪。

_Please stop, please stop, please.  
请停止，请停止，拜托了。_

One of the guns clicked empty. Asuka tossed it to the ground and brought the other to bear on the Angel, holding her fire.  
其中一把枪空膛作响，明日香将其抛至一旁，转而用另一把枪瞄准使徒，暂未扣动扳机。

"We think the core's **forming**, Asuka!" Maya's voice . "The Angel hid parts of it throughout its body. We can't hurt it until it's been entirely reconstructed!"  
我们认为核心正在形成，明日香！真嗣的声音说道：“天使将部分核心隐藏在体内。我们必须等到它完全重组后才能对其造成伤害！”

"What's happening to Shinji?" Misato cut through the chatter on the radio.  
‘真嗣发生什么事了？’ 美里打断了无线电里的闲聊。

"Diminishing life signs in Unit One!" another member of the deck crew. Asuka couldn't remember his name. "The cord has been severed. We're losing contact!"  
单位一的生命迹象正在减弱！" 甲板组的一名成员喊道，明日香一时想不起他的名字。"连接线已被切断，我们正在失去联系！

Asuka lined up her shot with the forming core. She spent agonizing moments waiting for the sphere to come to the surface. She waited, listening to the screams from the command deck.  
明日香瞄准了正在形成的核，准备射击。她焦急地等待着球体升至水面。在这段时间里，她聆听着指挥甲板上传来的阵阵尖叫。

Somewhere in her mind, Asuka remembered how she felt in Shinji's arms.  
在她的内心某个角落，明日香回忆起躺在真嗣怀抱中的那份感觉。

Finally, the sphere emerged. Asuka immediately pulled the trigger, only for the gun to click empty in her hands.  
终于，球体显现出来。明日香立刻扣动扳机，却只听到枪在手中发出空响。

_No. This can't be happening.  
不，这不可能正在发生。_

"Ninety seconds until the ammo drop, Asuka!"  
弹药空投倒计时九十秒，明日香！

_Not him. Please. He's all I have.  
别是他。求求你。他是我唯一的依靠。_

"-life signs are almost gone! We have-"  
-生命迹象已近消失！我们-

_I need him.  我需要他的帮助。_

"-et Unit Zero out of there before Rei-"  
-et 让零号单位赶紧离开那里，赶在丽之前-

_I love him. 我非常爱他。_

Asuka dropped the empty gun and drew the Evangelion's combat knife. She sprinted forward towards Shinji and the Angel.  
明日香扔掉空枪，抽出 EVA 的战斗刀，向着真嗣和使徒飞奔而去。

"Asuka, what are you doing?" Misato was screaming. "Do not engage! Repeat: do **NOT** engage the hostile at close range!"  
明日香，你在干什么？" 美里尖声喊道，"不要靠近！重复：绝不要近距离接触敌方！

The power cord to the Unit Two pulled taught, tethering Asuka back like a leash. Taking the cord in her hands, she sliced through it with the knife and kept running.  
二号单元的电源线被拉得紧绷，仿佛牵引绳一般将明日香拽回。她握住电线，用刀迅速割断，随即继续向前奔跑。

"Asuka, stop right now! Shut her down, she's going to get herself killed!"  
明日香，马上停下来！快把她关掉，她这样下去会没命的！

She reached the Angel at a full sprint, thrusting forward and driving her knife into the core up to its hilt. The Angel howled in agony. Limbs began to tear themselves away from Shinji and hook onto Asuka's Evangelion. Soon, Shinji was free of the tangle, but Asuka was completely ensnared. In the struggle, she caught sight of Shinji's discarded knife and reached for it, fighting against the millions of tiny hands dragging her down. Asuka steeled herself.  
她以全速冲至天使跟前，奋力一刺，刀刃深深没入核心直至刀柄。天使痛苦地嚎叫起来。肢体开始从真嗣身上脱离，钩向明日香的 EVA 机体。不久，真嗣摆脱了束缚，而明日香却被彻底困住。在激烈的挣扎中，她瞥见了真嗣遗落的刀，伸手去取，与无数小手拖拽她的力量抗争。明日香坚定了决心。

_If you've got wings... 如果你拥有翅膀..._

She used the last of her energy to thrust her hand towards the knife. Her fingers wrapped around it and she brought her arm up to plunge it into the core.  
她耗尽所有力气，伸手抓住那把刀。手指紧握刀柄，她奋力抬起手臂，意图将刀深深刺入核心。

But Asuka could not build up enough momentum against the Angel's onslaught. The creature deftly disarmed her, taking the knife into its own power and plunging it down towards Unit 02's head.  
然而，明日香在天使的猛烈攻击下难以积蓄足够的动力。那生物敏捷地夺走了她的刀，并将其狠狠地刺向二号机的头部。

---

They say that moments before you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes.  
据说在生命即将终结的瞬间，一生的经历会如电影般在眼前快速回放。

In the half of a second before the combat knife exploded through the front of the cockpit and impaled her, time slowed to a crawl for Asuka.  
在战斗刀穿透驾驶舱前壁并刺中她之前的半秒钟，对明日香而言，时间似乎变得异常缓慢。

_Please, oh God, let me live through this. I don't want to die like this. I want to live longer. I want to defeat the Angels. I want to change the world. I want to be remembered. I want to get married. I want to have a husband. I want to walk down an isle and I want it to be him at the end waiting for me. I want to grow old and I want to have children. I want it all so badly and I'm sorry I didn't admit it until now, but I was scared. I was so,_ _**so**_ _scared, and I'm scared right now, but I do want it. I want all of it. Please, just don't let this be the end. It's selfish and I'm sorry, but please. I'm_ _**begging**_ _you._  
上帝啊，请让我度过这一劫。我不想就这样死去。我渴望活得更长久，打败那些使徒，改变这个世界，留下我的印记。我梦想着结婚，拥有一个爱人，携手走过红毯，期待在尽头迎接我的是他。我向往着老去，拥有自己的孩子。我如此渴望这一切，直到此刻才敢坦白，因为我一直害怕。我非常非常害怕，尽管现在依然如此，但我确实渴望这一切。请不要让这成为我的终点。我知道这很自私，我深感抱歉，但我真心恳求。

_Oh, God, it's going to hurt, I just know it. It's going to hurt.  
哦，天哪，这肯定会很疼，我有预感。一定会很疼的。_

_It's going to hurt. It's going to hurt.  
这将会很疼。这将会很疼。_

_It's going to– 它即将——_

**AN**_: The next chapter will end everything. I once again offer my apologies for the wait. We should always finish what we start._  
AN：下一章将画上句点。我再次为等待表示歉意。我们应该始终有始有终。

### Chapter 6 Sanctuary
"Is she breathing?" “她还有呼吸吗？”

"...no." "...不。"

"Damn it... are you declaring time of death?"  
"该死...你是在宣布死亡时间吗？"

"Yeah, I'll... no, wait a second... yes, she is. She's breathing. Barely. There's a pulse. I don't know if we can move her."  
"是的，我...不，等一下...是的，她在呼吸。很微弱。有脉搏。我不知道我们能否移动她。"

"We've got to. There's no way they'll be able to operate out here. Jesus, look at all the blood..."  
"我们必须这么做。他们在这里根本无法进行手术。天哪，看看这满地的血..."

"Some's LCL." "有些是 LCL。"

"Yeah, and most of it's her blood. I mean, _Jesus_. We need a stretcher here right away, just look at her e-"  
"是啊，但大部分是她的血。我是说，天哪。我们需要一个担架马上过来，看看她的情况..."

---

"Can we save the arm?"  
"我们能保住这条胳膊吗？"

"Iffy. I'm not sure she'll even be able to use it again if we do. Look how deeply the incision cut through her shoulder here – there's going to be traumatic nerve damage no matter what we do."  
"不好说。即使我们尽力了，我也不确定她还能不能再用它。你看这刀口切得这么深，穿过肩膀——无论我们怎么做，神经损伤都是不可避免的。"

"Think it's worth trying?"  
"你觉得值得尝试吗？"

"Might be too dangerous. We'll be lucky if she survives the surgery, period. I'm not comfortable with risking her life for it."  
"可能太危险了。她能挺过手术已经是万幸了。我不愿意为了这个冒险让她丧命。"

"So, lose the arm?" "那么，截肢？"

"Maybe. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's get the anesthesiologist in here and start **immediately**. Start cleaning that glass out of the socket. The eye is completely gone and we need to make sure none of it went into her brai-"  
"或许吧。到时候再做决定。先叫麻醉师进来，马上开始。清理掉眼窝里的玻璃碎片。眼睛已经完全毁了，我们得确保没有碎片进入她的大脑——"

"Asuka-chan? It's Misato. I don't know if you can hear me – the doctors say you can, but... I don't know, I was never sure I believed that. I sort of always thought it was just something that they told people so that the people _thought_ they could be heard. For the family themselves, you know? Let them feel like they're doing something or... I guess I'm cynical. I hope you can hear me.  
明日香酱？我是美里。我不知道你是否能听到——医生说你能听到，但……我不确定，我总觉得那只是他们告诉家属的话，让他们觉得自己的声音能被听见。为了让家属感觉自己在做些什么，或者……我想我有点悲观。我希望你能听到。

"Listen, your father's requested your transfer back to Germany, so they're shipping you back tomorrow morning. Don't worry about what's happening at Nerv, it's... you've been... replaced as the third pilot. We just... Asuka, honestly, they say it's going to be a miracle if you ever wake up again, it's already incredible you're even technically alive, we just can't... we can't wait for you any more. I'm sorry. I am **so** sorry, Asuka, I know how much this meant to you.  
听着，你父亲要求把你转回德国，所以他们明天早上就会把你送回去。别担心 NERV 的事，你……你已经被替换为第三适格者了。我们只是……明日香，老实说，他们说如果你能再次醒来将是个奇迹，你现在能活着已经是个奇迹了，我们不能再……不能再等你了。对不起。真的很对不起，明日香，我知道这对你的意义有多大。

"Just... don't stop fighting, okay? You're amazing, Asuka, you're remarkable – you always have been, and it's _not_ because you're a pilot it's because you're _you_. You can be a real pain in the ass, and you're stubborn as hell, but I think it's the only thing keeping you alive, so please just... don't give up. I want to read in twenty years about what the incredible Langley Sohryu is doing. I mean, you're fourteen, Asuka. I hadn't done _shit_ when I was fourteen. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and it will be incredible, but you've just got to survive this. Okay? You've just got to hold on. Oh, damn it, I didn't want to start crying...  
"只是...别放弃战斗，好吗？你很了不起，明日香，你非常出色——你一直如此，这不仅仅因为你是驾驶员，而是因为你就是你。你确实让人头疼，固执得要命，但我想这正是让你活下去的原因，所以请...不要放弃。我希望二十年后还能读到关于了不起的 Langley Sohryu 的报道。我是说，你才十四岁，明日香。我十四岁时还一事无成。你的人生才刚刚开始，它会非常精彩，但你得先挺过这一关。好吗？你只需要坚持住。哦，该死，我不想哭出来的...

"...you probably can't even hear me, can you?  
"...你可能根本听不见我说话，对吧？

"...this is stupid. I'll leave.  
"...这太蠢了。我要走了。

"Oh, damn this phone... Yes, it's Katsuragi.  
"哦，该死的电话... 是的，我是桂木。

"...he wants to see her?  
"...他想见她？

"No. Absolutely not. Drive him back to the apartment right now. Consider it an order, Ritsuko.  
"不行。绝对不行。立刻把他送回公寓。这是命令，律子。

"Then tell him to be angry at me. I'll talk to him when I'm home. Just, whatever you do don't let him come here. He can't see her like this.  
“那就告诉他对我发火吧。我回家后会和他谈的。只是，无论如何别让他来这里。他不能看到她这个样子。”

"Because she's nearly in halves, for fuck's sake."  
“因为她几乎被撕成两半了，该死。”

---

"She hung up," Ritsuko said, shutting her mobile phone. She glanced over at the boy in the seat next to her. Shinji looked out the passenger side window at the streetlights passing them quickly by. Ritsuko sighed. "I'm sorry, Shinji. I've got to take you home."  
“她挂了电话，”律子说着，关上了手机。她瞥了一眼坐在旁边的男孩。真嗣望着窗外，街灯快速掠过。律子叹了口气。“对不起，真嗣。我得送你回家。”

He didn't answer. 他没有回答。

"If it matters, it's not just you. Rei wanted to visit as well," Ritsuko looked out at the road. "It's funny... we were all worried about Rei when she got hit, but she was the hero. I mean, you were unconscious by then, but Rei woke up. She killed the Angel. She saved your lives – all our lives, I suppose – and they turned her down flat. I guess you've probably already been told that..."  
"如果这有关系的话，不只是你。丽也想来探望，" 律子望着道路说。"真有意思... 丽被击中时我们都很担心，但她却是英雄。我是说，那时你已经昏迷了，但丽醒了过来。她消灭了使徒。她救了你们的命——我想也是我们所有人的命——而他们却断然拒绝了。我想你大概已经听说过了..."

"Is Asuka going to live?" Shinji's voice was unsteady.  
"明日香会活下来吗？" 真嗣的声音颤抖着。

Ritsuko closed her mouth and weighed her words carefully.  
律子闭上嘴，谨慎地斟酌着言辞。

"They're optimistic," Ritsuko smiled at him. "Besides, you know Asuka. She's too stubborn to die."  
"他们很乐观，" 律子朝他微笑，"再说，你了解明日香。她太倔强了，不会轻易放弃生命。"

"No she's not. No one is."  
"不，她不是。没有人是。"

Ritsuko's smile evaporated.  
律子的微笑消失了。

"People die for stupid reasons all the time. Car accidents, heart attacks, whatever. I don't think we usually know how or why we're going to go. Stories always tell us people die for a reason, but I think in real life it's not usually anything that makes a whole lot of sense. Maybe this is Asuka's stupid death?"  
人们总是因为愚蠢的理由死去。车祸、心脏病发作，诸如此类。我不认为我们通常知道自己将如何或为何离世。故事总是告诉我们人们为某个理由而死，但我认为现实生活中，这通常不是什么能说得通的事。也许这就是明日香那愚蠢的死法？

Ritsuko said nothing. 律子一言不发。

"It doesn't matter. I guess we all die before we're ready," Shinji concluded. "I don't even remember the last thing I said to her. It wasn't any sort of goodbye." He sighed. "I wish it had been."  
"没关系。我想我们都是在还没准备好的时候就死了，"真嗣总结道。"我甚至不记得最后一次对她说的话是什么。那不是任何形式的告别。"他叹了口气。"我希望那是。"

Ritsuko drove to Misato's apartment, and was secretly happy when Shinji got out of the car. She sped home to the cats waiting for her in her apartment and spent the night holding them close, reassuring herself that the warmth she felt was life, and that she had many years left ahead of her before whatever absolution waited for her on the other side.  
律子开车前往美里小姐的公寓，当真嗣下车时，她暗自高兴。她加速回家，公寓里的猫咪们正等着她，那一晚她紧紧抱着它们，让自己确信感受到的温暖就是生命，而她还有许多年可以活，直到彼岸等待她的某种解脱。

She hoped Asuka would live through the night.  
她希望明日香能挺过这一夜。

The door to the apartment slid open and the sense memory hit Asuka like a punch to the gut. This was the room she'd had her first kiss. This was the house where she'd fallen in love.  
公寓的门悄然滑开，感官记忆如同一记重拳击中了明日香。这是她第一次接吻的房间。这是她坠入爱河的房子。

But fires burn out and embers die when they're not fanned. She'd told herself how easy it would be to talk to him again. God knows she'd done it enough in all that bullshit mandatory therapy to practically draw a diagram for the best approach to the conversation. Even on the flight over: _Easy. He's just an old friend__._  
但火焰若不被煽动，终会熄灭。她曾告诉自己，再次与他交谈会有多容易。天知道她在那些强制治疗中已经练习得足够多，几乎可以画出最佳对话策略的图解。甚至在飞来的航班上：简单。他只是个老朋友。

It's common to think you forget someone's scent until you're surrounded by it.  
人们常以为自己会忘记某人的气味，直到被它包围。

"Don't you have to say something?" Kaji whispered next to her, smirking. Asuka blinked away the memories and forced a smile for him.  
"你不需要说点什么吗？" 加持在她旁边低声说道，嘴角带着一丝笑意。明日香眨了眨眼，驱散了回忆，勉强对他笑了笑。

"I'm home." “我回来了。”

The 18-year-old Asuka Langley Sohryu tenuously stepped into the apartment. It had been _her_ apartment half a lifetime ago. She adjusted her eyepatch nervously. "Where are they?"  
18 岁的惣流·明日香·兰格雷小心翼翼地踏进了公寓。这里曾是她半个生命之前的家。她紧张地调整了一下眼罩。"他们在哪儿？"

Kaji shrugged. "I dunno really. Thought they would have wanted to be home for this." He yawned. "Plane _was_ early, though. I'm sure they'll pop in soon enough."  
加持耸了耸肩。"我也不太清楚。以为他们会想在家里等我们。"他打了个哈欠。"不过飞机提前到了。我相信他们很快就会回来的。"

"Not knowing where your fiancé is? How scandalous, Mr. Kaji!" Asuka covered her mouth in mock surprise, her eye wide. "What if she's out seeing other men?"  
"不知道你的未婚妻在哪儿？真是有失体统，加治先生！" 明日香捂嘴佯装惊讶，眼睛睁得大大的。"万一她在外面见别的男人呢？"

Kaji chuckled. 加治轻声笑道。

"Funny thing about getting married: by the time you're ready to sign the paper, you've mostly stopped worrying they're gonna skip town. By the time you're _really_ ready, anyway. You'd be shocked how many people mistake falling in love with _being_ in love." He flipped a switch and everything was illuminated. "Trust me, the 'butterflies' stage is vastly overrated."  
"结婚这事儿挺有意思的：等你准备好签字的时候，基本上已经不太担心对方会跑路了。至少在你真正准备好的时候是这样。你会惊讶于有多少人把坠入爱河误认为是真爱。" 他拨动开关，四周顿时亮堂起来。"相信我，'心动'阶段被大大高估了。"

Asuka looked over at Kaji under the fluorescents.  
在荧光灯下，明日香瞥了一眼加持。

"So, I've gotta admit. I'm curious: what made you finally say yes?" she asked.  
“所以，我得承认，我很好奇：是什么让你最终答应了？”她问道。

Kaji let his gaze wander. "I realized life was too short to take things for granted anymore. I guess I grew up a little..." He redirected his attention to Asuka. "Speaking of growing up, look at you! There was a time when you would get tongue-tied alone in a room with me."  
加持让他的目光游移。“我意识到生命太短暂，不能再把事情视为理所当然了。我想我长大了一些……”他将注意力重新转向明日香。“说到成长，看看你！曾经有一段时间，你单独和我在一起时会紧张得说不出话来。”

Asuka laughed, stepping over to him. "So true." She wrapped her arms around the man, pulling him into a warm embrace. She sighed, happy. "I'm kind of glad that's over. No offense. "  
明日香笑着走向他。“确实如此。”她张开双臂抱住男人，将他拉进一个温暖的拥抱。她叹了口气，感到幸福。“我有点高兴那件事结束了。无意冒犯。”

"None taken. It certainly makes the conversation more interesting." Asuka closed her eye and let Kaji hug her.  
“没有冒犯。这确实让对话更有趣。”明日香闭上眼睛，任由加持拥抱她。

Out of all she had left behind in Japan, Kaji had probably changed the least, and Asuka needed to ground herself. This next one was going to be hard.  
在她离开日本所留下的一切中，加持可能是变化最小的，而明日香需要让自己脚踏实地。接下来的这件事将会很艰难。

"I want to see my room," she said.  
“我想看看我的房间。”她说。

When the door slid open, it hurt, but not as much as she thought it would. The part that really bothered Asuka was that she could still largely recognize the space – she saw the places where all of her things belonged. Her heart ached.  
当门滑开时，虽然有些痛，但并没有她想象中那么严重。真正让明日香感到困扰的是，她还能大致认出这个空间——她看到了所有东西应该放置的地方。她的心隐隐作痛。

She had expected something completely alien, but given maybe two hours, the room would have looked just like it did four years ago, the last time she was in Japan. The night she should have died, because she had been trying to save him.  
她本以为会看到一个完全陌生的环境，但或许只要两个小时，这个房间就会看起来和四年前她在日本的最后一次一样。那个她本该死去，因为她试图救他的夜晚。

Asuka had not escaped the incident unharmed. For starters, her left arm had lost much sensation, but remarkably, she could still move it and its fingers with varying degrees of fluidity. Considering that she had basically been cleaved in two, the fact that she still had an arm at all was a miracle, to say the least. Not to mention breath inside her lungs.  
明日香并未从那次事件中毫发无损地逃脱。首先，她的左臂失去了大部分知觉，但令人惊讶的是，她仍能以不同程度的流畅度移动它和它的手指。考虑到她几乎被劈成两半，她还能保有一条手臂本身就是一个奇迹，至少可以这么说。更不用说她肺中尚存的呼吸了。

She thought the eye patch was okay. Since her expulsion from the Evangelion program, the eye patch had taken the place of Asuka's once-trademark sync clips, in that she almost never removed it. Indeed, it had actually become an object she quite valued: it was proof that she had seen hell and lived to tell the tale. Pity she couldn't bring herself to think of the scars in a similar light.  
她觉得眼罩还不错。自从被逐出 EVA 计划后，眼罩取代了明日香曾经的标志性同步夹，她几乎从不摘下它。实际上，它已经成为她相当珍视的物品：它是她见证过地狱并幸存下来的证明。遗憾的是，她无法让自己以同样的光明心态看待那些伤疤。

The astonishing medical advancements made after the Second Impact had saved Asuka's life, but no amount of surgery could save her from the scars now ran down the front of her body. Starting at her shoulder, the jagged gash snaked along her torso, cutting through the valley between her breasts and crossing over her stomach diagonally to the top of her right hip.  
第二次冲击后惊人的医学进步挽救了明日香的生命，但再多的手术也无法消除她身上从前胸蜿蜒而下的伤疤。从肩膀开始，这条锯齿状的裂口沿着她的躯干蜿蜒而下，穿过她双乳之间的低谷，斜跨过她的腹部，延伸至她右臀的上部。

It had been a very long time before Asuka came to terms with her cosmetic injuries, that this grotesque scarring was now part of her body's shape and color. It angered her to admit it, but she was still a good deal self-conscious about how she looked. Her hair had made her stand out – the scars made her feel like a freak.  
过了很久，明日香才接受了自己外表上的伤痕，这些丑陋的疤痕如今已成为她身体形态和颜色的一部分。承认这一点让她感到愤怒，但她仍然对自己的外表相当在意。她的头发曾让她与众不同——而疤痕却让她觉得自己像个怪物。

She had swapped all of her two-piece bathing suits out for less revealing fare. Any clothes that showed her stomach ended up in the garbage. Asuka could count on one hand the amount of people who had seen her naked since she had fully healed, and there wasn't a single one yet who hadn't cringed when her top came off. It was the definition of 'mood killer'. She dimly remembered when she used to pride herself on her body.  
她把所有两件式的泳衣都换成了更保守的款式。任何露出她腹部的衣服最终都被扔进了垃圾桶。明日香可以用一只手数出自从她完全康复后见过她裸体的人数，而这些人中还没有一个在她脱掉上衣时不曾皱眉的。这简直就是“情绪杀手”。她隐约记得自己曾经为她的身体感到自豪。

An eye, an arm, and a sex life for a second chance to live: survival, it seemed, was not without its price. Overall though, she deemed it seemed a fair trade.  
一只眼睛，一条手臂，还有性生活，换来第二次活下去的机会：生存似乎是有代价的。不过总的来说，她认为这是一个公平的交易。

Asuka's hand drifted over the anonymous blankets that now adorned her bed. This was where she had almost lost her virginity.  
明日香的手轻轻拂过如今铺在她床上的那张无名毛毯。正是在这里，她几乎失去了童贞。

Almost. That had eventually happened many hundred miles away to someone entirely undeserving of the gift she had given him. He was an idiot, but it had been her choice. Seemed like a good idea at the time. And anyway, it was done with now. Asuka learned a long time ago that you can't change the past by letting it consume you.  
几乎。那件事最终在数百英里之外，与一个完全不配得到她这份礼物的人发生了。他是个傻瓜，但那是她的选择。当时似乎是个好主意。而且无论如何，现在一切都结束了。明日香很久以前就明白，你不能让过去吞噬你来改变它。

Somewhere between now and then, this room had ceased to be hers and had become a guest bedroom. Asuka dropped her bag onto the sheets. "_I'm home", indeed,_ she thought darkly. All of a sudden she didn't want to see anyone at all.  
不知何时起，这个房间已不再是她的，而变成了一个客房。明日香将包扔在床单上。“我回来了”，她暗自思忖，突然间她一点也不想见任何人。

Asuka turned to her bedroom door, and was about to close it when the front door opened.  
明日香转向她的卧室门，正要关上时，前门打开了。

Shinji was so unprepared to see her that all the groceries spilled from his hands. Asuka's thousands of prepared scenarios suddenly seemed worthless and false.  
真嗣完全没有预料到会看到她，以至于手中的所有杂货都散落一地。明日香准备好的成千上万个场景突然显得毫无价值且虚假。

She closed the door without saying a word.  
她一言不发地关上了门。

---

_Why didn't she talk to me?_ Shinji was haunted. He'd been in the same room as Asuka for five seconds and already he'd done something wrong. _Great. Just what I wanted._  
她为什么不跟我说话？真嗣感到困扰。他和明日香在同一个房间里才待了五秒钟，就已经做错了什么。真是糟糕透顶，这正是我不想要的。

He lay awake in his room, staring at the ceiling. It must have been past two already, but sleep was nowhere in sight. There were so many things he wanted to ask her that he didn't even know where to begin. The questions jumbled about in his brain, skipping like a record, with each repetition forming a different imagined response.  
他躺在自己的房间里，盯着天花板无法入睡。时间肯定已经过了两点，但睡意却丝毫不见踪影。他有许多想问她的问题，以至于连从何问起都不知道。这些问题在他的脑海中乱窜，像跳针的唱片一样，每一次重复都形成了不同的想象中的回答。

Not that they were necessarily talking – Shinji wasn't entirely clear on that, yet.  
并非他们一定在交谈——真嗣对此还不是完全清楚。

Misato had arrived home not long after him, and when she had spoken to Asuka in her room, she had said the girl seemed fine – a little jet lagged, but certainly Asuka. Shinji hadn't yet worked up the courage to venture into her room.  
美里不久后也回到了家，当她在房间里和明日香交谈时，她说那女孩看起来还不错——有点时差反应，但确实是明日香。真嗣还没有鼓起勇气走进她的房间。

_Maybe she wants me to come see her? This is a test or something?  
也许她想让我去看她？这是某种考验吗？_

He thought of the withering look she had shot him in the doorway.  
他想起了她在门口投向他的那冷漠的一瞥。

_Maybe she's very tired and I should wait until tomorrow._ Shinji rolled over onto his side and sighed deeply.  
也许她太累了，我应该等到明天。真嗣翻身侧躺，深深地叹了口气。

He wasn't extremely adept at courtship, but he'd had girlfriends, to be sure. Heck, there was even a brief period after the whole Hikari/Touji fiasco where he'd gone steady with the class rep (Nice girl. Good kisser.) Shinji wasn't exactly Cassanova, but he'd been around the block enough to know that it wasn't just girls, it was _her_. That damn redhead. Four years had certainly not changed that Asuka could get under his skin without even saying a word.  
他并不特别擅长追求女生，但确实有过女朋友。说起来，在光/剑介那件事之后，还有过一段短暂的时间他和班长交往过（好女孩，吻技不错。）真嗣虽算不上情场高手，但也算是见过世面，他知道这不仅仅是女生的问题，而是她。那个该死的红发女孩。四年过去了，阿斯克确实没变，她甚至不用开口就能让他心烦意乱。

He pushed himself up from the mattress and walked towards the kitchen. He needed something in his stomach.  
他从床垫上撑起身，走向厨房。他需要吃点东西填填肚子。

And there she was, standing at the counter, brewing tea, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Asuka had always had a talent for inhabiting places as if she was their sole proprietor. Shinji noticed her back stiffen slightly. For a moment.  
她就站在那里，站在柜台前，泡着茶，仿佛这是世界上最自然不过的事情。明日香总是有一种天赋，能像这个地方的唯一主人一样自在。真嗣注意到她的背微微僵硬了一下。有那么一会儿。

She turned around, and the two took teach other in for the first time, assessing the damage.  
她转过身来，两人第一次互相打量，评估着彼此的变化。

_Four years... 四年了……_

"You're different," she growled. "You don't look the same at all."  
"你变了，"她咆哮道。"你看起来完全不一样了。"

Shinji didn't say anything, but he couldn't help but agree with the sentiment. Misato was wrong. There were passing similarities, sure – but this woman barely looked like Asuka at all. Maybe her angry older sister.  
真嗣没有说话，但他不得不承认这种感觉。美里错了。确实有些相似之处，但这个女人几乎不像明日香。或许更像她那易怒的姐姐。

"How... how was your flight?" he began uncertainly, before shaking his head. "That's a stupid thing to ask... I'm sorry. I have no idea how to-"  
"你...你的航班怎么样？"他不确定地开口，随即摇了摇头。"问这个真蠢...对不起。我不知道该怎么-"

"Why didn't you call me?"  
“你为什么不给我打电话？”

Shinji blinked. "...what?"  
“真嗣眨了眨眼。“……什么？”

"I could understand for a while, I really could. You might have been busy here, fighting Angels and all that. They probably wouldn't have let me take calls anyway." Asuka lined Shinji up in her sights. "Why didn't you call?"  
“我可以理解一段时间，真的可以。你可能在这里忙着对抗使徒之类的。他们大概也不会让我接电话。”明日香将真嗣锁定在自己的视线中。“你为什么不打电话？”

Shinji's tongue felt like lead in his mouth. He hadn't prepared for this. "...what do you-?"  
真嗣的舌头在他嘴里像铅一样沉重。他没准备好面对这个。"...你想说什么？"

"_Years_, Shinji!" Asuka shouted, her eye blazing with anger. "I waited for a phonecall, a letter – ANY sign that you cared I was even still alive! Do you know what it's like to wait for someone like that? _Years_ and I got nothing. Silence." Shinji didn't think it was possible to sip tea judgmentally. He watched her do it twice. "I wasn't allowed to make outgoing calls until six months ago. What's your excuse?"  
“这么多年，真嗣！”明日香喊道，她的眼睛因愤怒而闪烁。“我等过你的电话，你的信——任何能表明你还关心我是否活着的迹象！你知道那样等待一个人是什么感觉吗？年复一年，我什么都没等到。只有沉默。”真嗣不认为有人能带着评判意味地喝茶。他看着她这样做了两次。“直到六个月前，我都不被允许打外线电话。你的借口是什么？”

Out of the black, Shinji felt his own anger rising.  
在黑暗中，真嗣感到自己的怒火也在升腾。

"That's completely unfair! I didn't know you wanted me to call you!"  
"那太不公平了！我不知道你想让我给你打电话！"

"You're dodging the question."  
"你在回避问题。"

"And you're being a bitch!" Asuka blinked, taken slightly aback by the bite in his tone. _That_ was new. Looks like some backbone had finally formed under that newer, older exterior.  
"而你真是个泼妇！" 明日香眨了眨眼，被他语气中的尖锐稍稍惊到。这倒是新鲜。看来在那副更新、更成熟的表象下，终于长出了些骨气。

She picked up her mug and turned to go back to her room.  
她拿起杯子，转身走回自己的房间。

Shinji stepped towards her. "No, wait – stop!"  
真嗣向她走去。“不，等等——别走！”

To his great surprise, she actually paused in the doorway to her old room. Her head tilted forward and rested against the screen. Asuka sighed. "This was a mistake. I should have stayed in Germany."  
令他大为惊讶的是，她真的在旧房间的门口停了下来。她的头向前倾斜，靠在了门框上。明日香叹了口气。“这是个错误。我应该留在德国的。”

"No! Look, I didn't want to argue." Shinji moved to put his hand on her shoulder, but retracted it before it brushed her skin. It dropped uselessly to his side. "I... I missed you, Asuka."  
"不！听着，我不想吵架。" 真嗣伸手想要搭在她的肩上，却在触碰到她肌肤前缩了回来。手无助地垂在身侧。"我……我想你了，明日香。"

She spun, face twisted into a scowl. "Then you could have fucking called me."  
她猛地转身，脸上满是怒容。"那你他妈的可以给我打电话啊。"

"And said what?" Shinji roared, his anger and pain flooding back. "What could I possibly say to you over the phone when you're thousands of miles away?" His eyes dodged away from her, into a far dark corner. "You... you _died_ for me, Asuka. Maybe not for long, but it happened. Don't you know what that meant to me? I'm sure nobody had ever even _thought_ about that before. I didn't know anyone would have that kind of... Do you know how long I..." he trailed off, shaking his head.  
"打电话说什么？" 真嗣咆哮道，愤怒与痛苦再次涌上心头。"你远在千里之外，我能在电话里对你说什么？" 他的目光避开她，投向一个遥远的黑暗角落。"你……你为我而死，明日香。也许时间不长，但确实发生了。你不知道那对我意味着什么吗？我敢肯定之前从没有人考虑过这一点。我不知道会有人有那种……你知道我花了多长时间……" 他话音渐弱，摇了摇头。

Shinji had been unaware these emotions were even inside of him, and his expression of them felt awkward and haphazard. When he was ready, he looked back to her. "How... how was I supposed to react to that? What was I supposed to say?"  
真嗣之前并未意识到这些情感深藏于心，当他试图表达时，显得笨拙而随意。当他准备好后，再次看向她。“我……我应该如何回应？我该说什么？”

Asuka took a step backwards, genuinely hurt. Her hands braced her body against the door for support. Shinji watched helplessly as she began to cry.  
明日香后退一步，真的受伤了。她的手撑在门上以支撑身体。真嗣无助地看着她开始哭泣。

"Idiot. You could have said anything. _Anything._ You just had to pick up the phone. I wanted your voice. I wanted you. I needed you there and you were _gone_. You could have said anything at all..."  
“笨蛋。你本可以说任何话。任何话。你只需要拿起电话。我想要你的声音。我想要你。我需要你在那里，而你却不在。你本可以说任何话……”

Asuka looked away from him, wiping her face with the back of her hand. "God damn it. I'm home for four hours and I'm crying again." She tried to laugh, but it emerged as a choking sob. "How do you do this to me, anyway? Why the hell can't I just be myself around you? I'm not this person, Ikari! I'm not this mess! I'm confident and I'm self-sufficient and I don't cry about feelings I haven't had in years!"  
明日香从他身上移开目光，用手背擦了擦脸。“该死。我回家才四个小时，又开始哭了。”她试图笑出来，却变成了哽咽。“你到底是怎么做到的？为什么我不能在你面前做自己？我不是这样的人，碇！我不是这个混乱的样子！我自信、自立，我不会为那些多年未有的感觉哭泣！”

Asuka bit her bottom lip, and she was forced to stop talking. She slid the door open behind her.  
明日香咬住下唇，不得不停止说话。她拉开了身后的门。

"This was a mistake. I'm going to stay through the wedding for Misato and Kaji, but then I should really leave. I'm sorry. I thought I was ready."  
“这是个错误。我会为了美里和加持参加完婚礼，但之后我真的该离开了。对不起。我以为我已经准备好了。”

She stepped into her room, disappearing like a phantom into mist.  
她踏入房间，宛如幽灵消融于雾中。

_Yes. Binding contract. Together in sickness and in health and until the end of time.  
是的。缔结契约。无论疾病或健康，直至时间的尽头，我们都将共度。_

_'_The end of time.' What the hell did that even mean?  
“时间的尽头。”这他妈到底是什么意思？

Shinji watched the jubilation on the dance floor, seated alone at a table, somewhere to the sidelines. He adjusted his tie and sighed.  
真嗣坐在一旁，独自一桌，看着舞池中的欢腾。他调整了一下领带，叹了口气。

Misato had looked beautiful, Kaji had finally shaved and donned respectable clothing. They had smiled, kissed, and that was that. Elated, married, and now dancing.  
美里看起来很美，加持终于剃了胡子，穿上了体面的衣服。他们微笑着，亲吻着，就这样。欣喜若狂，结了婚，现在正在跳舞。

Shinji was genuinely happy for his roommate, former commander. Weddings were usually not his thing, but it was hard to be glum while watching her glow. She just looked so _happy_ when Kaji spun her. She laughed as they almost tripped, dancing into another couple. Kaji apologized before wrapping his hands around her waist and pulling her into another kiss.  
真嗣真心为他的室友、前指挥官感到高兴。婚礼通常不是他的菜，但看着她容光焕发，很难感到忧郁。当加持旋转她时，她看起来如此幸福。她大笑着，他们几乎绊倒，跳舞撞到了另一对情侣。加持道歉后，双手环住她的腰，又将她拉入另一个吻中。

"Heya, chief!" Touji pulled up a chair and slouched next to Shinji. He couldn't help but notice that Touji's once-pristine suit had already become 'customized' by his interactions with the open bar. Shinji hoped that it wasn't a rental. "Great party, huh?"  
"嘿，头儿！" 托基拉过一把椅子，懒洋洋地坐在真嗣旁边。他不禁注意到，托基那件曾经一尘不染的西装，在与开放式酒吧的互动中已经变得'定制化'了。真嗣希望那不是租来的。"真是个好派对，对吧？"

"Yeah, it's actually kind of fun." Shinji smiled. Four years had done little but enhance Touji's jawline. Shinji figured he was too stubborn to let it have any lasting effect on his personality. "Did you see Kensuke?"  
"是啊，其实挺有趣的。" 真嗣微笑道。四年的时间几乎没有改变托基的下巴线条。真嗣认为他太固执了，不会让时间对他的性格产生持久影响。"你看到健介了吗？"

"Nah. Where's he gotten to?"  
"没有。他跑哪儿去了？"

Shinji pointed over to an area beside the dancefloor where their classmate was engaged in conversation with Hikari Horaki. She laughed girlishly at something he said and hit him playfully on the shoulder.  
真嗣指向舞池旁边的一个区域，他们的同学正和 Hikari Horaki 交谈。她听到他说的话后，少女般地笑了起来，并开玩笑地拍了拍他的肩膀。

Touji grinned, shaking his fist at the two of them. "That traitor!" He leaned back in his chair and sighed, his words carrying no real malice at all. That fire had gone out long ago. "So, speaking of ancient history..." Touji rolled his head over to look at Shinji. "...you seen her yet?"  
トウジ咧嘴一笑，对着那两人挥了挥拳头。“那个叛徒！”他靠回椅背，叹了口气，话语中并无真正的恶意。那份激情早已消逝。“那么，说到陈年旧事……”トウジ转头看向真嗣。“……你见到她了吗？”

Shinji shook his head. "Not since the ceremony."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"自从仪式之后就没见过了。"

"She looked good. Fantastic, actually. And I like the eye patch. It's stora badass." Touji sat up in his chair, downing what was left in his cup. "Don't tell her I said that."  
"她看起来不错。实际上，非常棒。我喜欢那个眼罩。真他妈酷。" 冬二从椅子上坐直，喝光了杯中剩下的东西。"别告诉她我说了这些。"

"Oh, that won't be a problem," Shinji mumbled sullenly. Touji cocked his eyebrow.  
"哦，那不会有问题的，" 真嗣闷闷不乐地咕哝道。冬二挑了挑眉毛。

"Again? Already?" "又来了？这么快？"

"Forever. But it's always like this with her." Shinji sighed. "We fight, it's our way."  
"永远都是这样。但和她在一起总是如此。" 真嗣叹了口气。"我们争吵，这是我们的相处方式。"

Touji twirled his cup contemplatively in his hands.  
托基若有所思地转动着手中的杯子。

"Hey chief, I'm not really good with words like some people, so I don't want to spend a ton of time having a golden moment here, but... I dunno. I went steady with the class rep for a while, and it didn't work out great, but we _tried_, you know?" Touji shrugged. "I mean, I know it's different with you and Sohryu, but... even though we barely talk now, I'm happy Hikari and I dated. I think sometimes cars have to crash, and that's the only way you can move forward, or somethin'. Otherwise things just stay the same."  
"嘿，老大，我不像某些人那样擅长言辞，所以不想在这里浪费太多时间搞什么黄金时刻，但是... 我也不清楚。我和班代表交往过一段时间，结果并不太好，但我们尝试过，你知道吗？" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"我是说，我知道你和惣流的情况不同，但是... 即使我们现在几乎不说话，我还是很高兴我和光交往过。我觉得有时候车子必须撞毁，那是你唯一能前进的方式，或者什么的。否则事情就永远停滞不前。"

Shinji looked over at his friend in genuine surprise. The pensieve look vanished from Touji's face – a haphazard grin set up in its stead.  
真嗣惊讶地看向他的朋友。真嗣脸上的沉思表情消失了——取而代之的是一个随意的笑容。

"But what do I know? I'm not dancin' with anyone, either." He stood up, stretching out his neck.  
"但我知道什么呢？我也没和谁跳舞。" 他站起身，伸展了一下脖子。

As if on cue, the fast celebratory number that was propelling the crowd came to an end, and a ballad picked up in its place.  
仿佛是按了开关，那首推动人群狂欢的快节奏庆祝曲目戛然而止，取而代之的是一首抒情歌。

"Did you ever consider seriously dating Asuka?" Shinji asked. Touji let out a single, loud guffaw.  
"你有没有认真考虑过和明日香约会？" 真嗣问道。剑介发出了一声响亮的嘲笑。

"No," he replied, turning back towards the bar. "Too much stress. You have fun with that one, pal." Touji disappeared in the crowd of people. Shinji smiled. _Same old Suzuhara._  
"没有，" 他回答，转身回到吧台。"压力太大了。你跟她玩得开心点，伙计。" 剑介消失在人群中。真嗣笑了笑。还是那个铃原。

When Shinji turned back towards the dancefloor, he realized he was no longer alone. The dress fit her perfectly. Touji had really, if anything, undersold just how perfectly it accentuated the curves that had developed since her blossom into adulthood. A tasteful alteration over her shoulder hid the majority of the scar tissue, and it wasn't as if anyone would really be looking when its wearer had become so stunning.  
当真嗣转身面向舞池时，他意识到自己不再孤单。那件礼服她穿得恰到好处。东治确实，如果说有什么不足的话，就是低估了这件衣服如何完美地突显了她成年后逐渐形成的曲线。她肩上恰到好处的改动遮住了大部分的疤痕组织，而且当穿着者变得如此迷人时，谁又会真的去注意那些呢。

Of course it was red.  
当然，它是红色的。

"I'm tired of fighting. I really am," Asuka whispered. Shinji opened his mouth to apologize, but she kept talking. "When I was recovering, I missed you more than I thought was possible to miss someone, and it hurt. For the longest time, I was angry, but... I might have needed the space, I think. I had to grow. The time wasn't right," she sighed. "I'm sorry I lashed out at you. You didn't deserve it."  
“我厌倦了战斗。我真的厌倦了，”明日香低声说道。真嗣张嘴想要道歉，但她继续说着。“在我康复期间，我想你超过了我认为可能想念一个人的程度，这让我很痛苦。很长一段时间里，我很生气，但是……我可能需要那个空间，我想。我必须成长。时机不对，”她叹了口气。“对不起，我对你发火了。你不该受那样的对待。”

"I should have-" he began, but Asuka held up a hand, prompting him to stop.  
"我本应该——" 他开口道，但明日香举起一只手，示意他停下。

"You could fill _books_ with the things we've messed up, Shinji. Seems like we're kind of prone to it," she shrugged, smirking. "But honestly, I lied the other night. I _can_ be myself around you, maybe only you. You've seen parts of me no one else has, and sometimes I'm the most awful person... But I know that no matter how much I mess up, no matter how broken I get, you will somehow still come back." She chuckled. "I don't know _why_, but..."  
"我们搞砸的事情足以填满好几本书了，真嗣。看来我们似乎特别容易搞砸，" 她耸耸肩，带着一丝讥讽的笑意。"但说真的，前几天晚上我撒了个谎。我在你面前可以做自己，也许只有你。你见过我别人未曾见过的部分，有时我是个非常糟糕的人……但我知道，无论我搞砸多少次，无论我变得多么破碎，你总会以某种方式回来。" 她轻笑一声。"我不知道为什么，但是……"

"And you would die for me," he stated simply. "I guess that makes us friends."  
"而你愿意为我而死，" 他简单地陈述道。"我想这让我们成了朋友。"

Asuka smiled genuinely for the first time since she'd returned from Germany.  
自打从德国回来后，明日香第一次露出了真心的微笑。

She extended her hand towards Shinji, her fingers reaching out, palm up.  
她向真嗣伸出手，手指向前伸展，掌心向上。

"Would you dance with me?" she asked. His hand came up without any hesitation.  
“愿意和我跳支舞吗？”她问道。他毫不犹豫地抬起了手。

Asuka rested her head on his chest as they swayed back and forth in time to the music. She knew that one day Shinji would see all of her scars. Truth be told, she was sort of looking forward to it.  
明日香将头靠在他的胸前，随着音乐的节奏前后摇摆。她知道总有一天，真嗣会看到她所有的伤痕。说实话，她对此还有些期待。

One day he would undress her, and when her dress would come off, Shinji wouldn't cringe. He would accept it, because that was what he did. He looked at how ugly she was, and knew that it was human. He saw how disgusting she felt and somehow made her feel beautiful, even if he had to drag it out of her kicking and screaming.  
总有一天他会为她宽衣，当她的裙子滑落时，真嗣不会退缩。他会接受这一切，因为他就是这样的人。他看着她那丑陋的模样，知道这是人性的体现。他察觉到她内心的厌恶感，却不知怎的让她觉得自己依然美丽，哪怕这需要他费尽心思，甚至在她挣扎反抗中才能实现。

Something connected them, and whether they were friends or enemies or lovers, they were on this journey together. They would fight, surely, but she would rather argue with him than be with anyone else.  
某种联系将他们紧紧相连，无论是朋友、敌人还是恋人，他们都在这条路上共同前行。他们肯定会争吵，但她宁愿与他争执，也不愿与他人共处。

Asuka smiled and closed her eye. She locked her fingers behind his back and held him closer.  
明日香微笑着闭上了眼睛。她将手指扣在他的背后，将他抱得更紧。

"Baka-Shinji..." she whispered.  
“笨蛋真嗣……”她低声呢喃。

She breathed him in and knew this moment would stay with her forever.  
她深深地呼吸着他的气息，知道这一刻将永远留在她的记忆中。

### Chapter 7 Every Monster
"Can I be completely honest with you?" Lips were licked – an appetite whet before the plunge.  
“我能完全对你坦诚吗？”他舔了舔嘴唇——在深入之前先激起了欲望。

Shinji shivered, nodding. Asuka looked into his eyes and opened her mouth.  
真嗣颤抖着点点头。明日香凝视着他的眼睛，张开了嘴。

"I don't want to see any of these," she pointed to the list of movies on the computer screen. "This is the only one that doesn't look what I would consider 'aggressively stupid', and they're only playing it in 3D. Not getting a whole lot out of that one." She tapped on her eyepatch to drive the point home. "You know. Depth perception and all that."  
“我不想看这些，”她指着电脑屏幕上的电影列表说，“这是唯一一部看起来不那么‘刻意愚蠢’的，而且他们只放映 3D 版。从那部片子里也得不到什么。”她敲了敲眼罩，强调这一点，“你知道的，深度感知什么的。”

Shinji sighed, closing his laptop. "Right. What's your suggestion then?" he glanced up at her. "We have three hours until the party, so... watch something here?"  
真嗣叹了口气，合上笔记本电脑。“好吧。那你的建议呢？”他抬头看着她，“离派对还有三个小时，所以……在这里看些什么？”

"_Ugh!_ I dunno, I dunno..." Asuka stood up, hands sullenly tucked into the front pocket of her hoodie. "Stupid fad. Stupid glasses. Why do people want things to pop out at them, anyway?" She lazily tipped her mug over with her foot, and the remaining drips of hot chocolate drizzled out onto the hardwood floor. She let out an exasperated groan and turned towards the kitchen.  
"唉！我不知道，我不知道..." 明日香站起身来，双手郁闷地插在连帽衫的前口袋里。"愚蠢的潮流。愚蠢的眼镜。为什么人们想要东西突然弹出来，真是的？" 她懒洋洋地用脚把杯子倾斜，剩下的热巧克力滴落在硬木地板上。她发出一声无奈的叹息，转身朝厨房走去。

"I'm not cleaning that up," Shinji offered, opening his laptop again.  
"我才不收拾那个，" 真嗣提议道，再次打开了他的笔记本电脑。

"I know, Ikari. Jesus, keep your shirt on," she walked back in, paper towels already in hand. With Shinji as designated cook, Asuka had quickly found her niche as designated cleaner-of-things-she-spilled.  
"我知道，碇。天哪，别急嘛，" 她走回来，手里已经拿着纸巾。既然真嗣是 designated cook（指定厨师），明日香很快就找到了自己的定位——designated cleaner-of-things-she-spilled（指定清理她洒的东西的人）。

When Misato moved out to live with Kaji, Shinji's search for a roommate had been mercifully brief: Asuka had stepped forward and offered the same day. She wanted to stay in Tokyo-3 for a little while, everything worked out.  
当美里搬出去与加持同住时，真嗣寻找室友的过程倒是出奇地短暂：明日香当天就主动提出要搬进来。她想在第三新东京市多待一段时间，一切就这么顺理成章地解决了。

After a week, the initial awkwardness had blurred into something resembling their older pattern. It was fun, but things were different for Shinji. Their friendly war felt strangely comfortable. There was a layer of warmth there that had been lacking when they were younger – a security of knowing the other intimately, but also discovering new things.  
一周后，最初的尴尬逐渐模糊，变得像是回到了他们以往的模式。虽然有趣，但对真嗣来说，一切都不一样了。他们之间的友好竞争感觉异常舒适。那里多了一层温暖，是他们年轻时所缺乏的——一种既熟悉又不断发现新事物的安全感。

So much about Asuka was the same that in some ways it felt like picking up right where they left off. She still yelled, she still called him an idiot, she still insisted he sneaked peeks at her in the bathroom... but now there was also the occasional moment of disconnect – realizing that four years had passed and time had changed them in ways both large and small.  
明日香在很多方面都和以前一样，以至于在某种程度上，感觉就像是从他们中断的地方直接接上。她依然会大喊大叫，依然会骂他笨蛋，依然坚持说他偷看她在浴室里...但现在也偶尔会有脱节的时刻——意识到四年的时间已经过去，时间以各种大大小小的方式改变了他们。

A particularly brazen Shinji had called his roommate's bluff last week when she offered to show him what was under her bath towel. After a moment's consideration, Asuka fluttered and folded.  
上周，一个特别大胆的 Shinji 揭穿了他室友的虚张声势，当时她提出要给他看看她浴巾下的秘密。经过片刻的考虑，Asuka 颤抖着折叠起来。

"You... might be surprised..." was all she said, before slinking to her room, leaving the young man completely lost for words. He hadn't actually expected his roommate to go through with it, but he also hadn't expected her to wilt and crumble like a scolded child. Shinji had made her a particularly sumptuous dinner that night, and no one had mentioned it since.  
“你……可能会感到惊讶……”她只说了这么一句，然后悄悄溜回自己的房间，留下年轻人完全无言以对。他其实并没有指望他的室友真的会这么做，但他也没想到她会像一个被训斥的孩子一样萎靡不振。那天晚上，Shinji 为她做了一顿特别丰盛的晚餐，从那以后就没人再提起这件事了。

Currently, the redhead kneeled away from him on the ground, running a paper towel over the spot on the floor. Her stunted flirtations puzzled Shinji. She remained trim as ever, but time and maturity had filled her out in a myriad of welcome ways. D-cup, Shinji couldn't help but notice last time he did the laundry. D-cup was new.  
目前，红发女孩跪在地上，离他有些距离，用一张纸巾擦拭地板上的污渍。她那断断续续的调情让 Shinji 感到困惑。她依旧保持着苗条的身材，但随着时间的推移和成熟，她在许多令人欢迎的方面变得更加丰满。D 罩杯，Shinji 上次洗衣服时忍不住注意到了。D 罩杯是新的。

Her body was terrific, of course, but didn't she realize that wasn't what was attractive about her? It certainly wasn't her body that Shinji had fallen in love with. It wasn't her body that he missed through the rest of high school.  
她的身材当然很棒，但她难道没意识到那并不是她吸引人的地方吗？碇真嗣爱上她的原因肯定不是她的身体。他在高中剩下的时间里所怀念的，也不是她的身体。

_What was she so preoccupied with?  
她到底在想些什么呢？_

Asuka turned towards him and Shinji realized he was staring at her.  
明日香转向他，真嗣这才意识到自己一直在盯着她看。

"See anything you like, perv?" Asuka grinned lasciviously, displaying her rear a little more prominently in the air in Shinji's direction. He rolled his eyes, and she laughed.  
“看到什么喜欢的了吗，变态？”明日香挑逗地笑着，故意将臀部在空中向真嗣的方向挺得更显眼。他翻了个白眼，她则大笑起来。

"Dummy," she intoned as she plopped down on the couch next to him. Asuka let breath slide out through her nose as her head came to a rest on his shoulder, and for a moment no one spoke.  
“傻瓜，”她轻声说着，一屁股坐在他旁边的沙发上。明日香的头靠在他的肩上，轻轻呼出一口气，一时间两人都沉默不语。

Her flirtation was decidedly... altered. There was something almost tentative about it. A paradigm had shifted. She was _bundled up_. Shinji had fond memories of summers where Asuka would lounge around, practically in her underwear, but lately the showing of skin seemed far more taboo.  
她的调情明显变得……有所不同。带有一种近乎试探的意味。某种范式已经转变。她裹得严严实实。真嗣还记得那些夏天，明日香几乎只穿着内衣懒洋洋地躺着，但最近，展露肌肤似乎变得禁忌多了。

Then again, it was December. People were cold. Asuka was 'people', too.  
不过话说回来，那时是十二月。人们都感到寒冷。明日香也是‘人们’中的一员。

Shinji blinked for a second and realized from the evenness of her breathing that she had fallen asleep on his shoulder. He smiled and gently shut his laptop.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，从她均匀的呼吸中意识到她已经靠在他的肩膀上睡着了。他微微一笑，轻轻地合上了笔记本电脑。

It was strange. She was comfortable enough to cuddle in against him and slumber, but long sleeves and hoodies were still the dress code.  
这很奇怪。她舒适到可以依偎在他身边入睡，但长袖和连帽衫仍然是着装要求。

Shinji closed his eyes and rested his head gently against hers. He fell asleep wondering if she knew her hair smelled like cinnamon and if the rest of her tasted so sweet.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，轻轻地将头靠在她的头上。他入睡时想着，她是否知道自己的头发散发着肉桂的香气，以及她其余部分是否同样甜美。

---

"Right, so this is all _my_ fault!" Asuka squeezed more conditioner into her hand and angrily tugged her fingers through her hair. "You were sleeping too, idiot!"  
“对，这都是我的错！”明日香又挤了一些护发素到手上，生气地用手指梳理着头发。“你也在睡觉，白痴！”

Closing her eyes to enjoy his closeness had turned into a five-hour power nap against the idiot's shoulder, and now not only were they both terribly late to Hikari's Christmas Party, but Asuka had further cemented her status as the sleepiest former-pilot in the eastern hemisphere. She grit her teeth, already anticipating mockery. _I will have vindication, I swear it._  
闭上眼睛享受他的亲近，结果变成了一场五小时的打盹，靠在那个白痴的肩膀上，现在不仅他们俩都严重迟到了光子的圣诞派对，而且明日香还进一步巩固了她作为东半球最困的前驾驶员的地位。她咬紧牙关，已经预料到会被嘲笑。我发誓，我会得到平反的。

She caught the outline of Shinji in the outer room. The door to the bathroom was left ajar for steam to vent, due to a broken bathroom fan last week that neither roommate had gotten around to fixing. A casing of frosted glass protected Asuka's modesty, but she still felt vaguely uncomfortable with his proximity to her nakedness.  
她在外间捕捉到了真嗣的轮廓。由于上周浴室风扇坏了，两位室友都还没来得及修理，浴室门便半开着以释放蒸汽。一层磨砂玻璃保护着明日香的隐私，但她仍因他靠近自己的裸体而感到隐约的不适。

She was painfully aware that the last memory Shinji had of her body was smooth, pristine whiteness. Sliding her fingers across her stomach, she winced as they caught on the jagged ridge of her scar. There was no pain there, of course, all the nerves were dead. It just looked... _monstrous_. Disgusting. She turned the shower hotter and scowled.  
她痛苦地意识到，真嗣对她的身体的最后记忆是光滑无瑕的洁白。她用手指划过腹部，当触及那道参差不齐的疤痕时，不禁皱眉。当然，那里并不痛，所有的神经都已死亡。只是看起来……怪异。令人作呕。她将淋浴调得更热，皱起了眉头。

This was ridiculous. The embarrassing truth was that she wanted him. It was _astounding_ how much she wanted him. She kept flaunting and flaunting herself and hoped he would grow balls and take the decision out of her hands, but she knew he never would. Deep down she wasn't even sure she really wanted him to. _Like that? In the heat of a moment?_  
这太荒谬了。令人尴尬的事实是，她渴望他。她多么渴望他，这简直令人震惊。她不断展示自己，希望他能鼓起勇气，替她做出决定，但她知道他永远不会。内心深处，她甚至不确定自己是否真的希望他那样做。在那一刻的激情中？

Asuka closed her eye and reached for the facial cream. When her fingers touched nothing, she glanced up and remembered it was still sitting out in the living room from last night. She groaned.  
明日香闭上眼睛，伸手去拿面霜。当她的手指触碰到空无一物时，她抬头一看，才想起昨晚还放在客厅里。她叹了口气。

After a brief moment of indecision, Asuka swallowed her pride and called. "Shinji!"  
经过短暂的犹豫，明日香咽下自尊，喊道：“真嗣！”

His silhouette appeared in the foggy doorway. Asuka covered herself, even though she was completely certain he could see nothing at all through the glass.  
他的身影出现在雾蒙蒙的门口。明日香遮住自己，尽管她完全确定他透过玻璃根本什么也看不见。

"I left the face stuff on the couch. Could you grab it?"  
"我把脸上的东西落在沙发上了。你能帮我拿一下吗？"

He disappeared with tacit acceptance of the task.  
他默默接受了任务，随即消失了。

When he had dared her last week to live up to her boasting, Asuka's courage had folded. Her previous assuredness had faltered. _He'll flinch. I know he'll flinch. I'm maimed. I don't want him to think of me as some sort of freak: a once-beautiful machine that is broken. The eye is bad enough._ She found she wasn't as proud of the eyepatch around him. He reminded her uncomfortably often that her vision used to be binary.  
上周他挑战她要兑现自己的吹嘘时，明日香勇气顿失。她之前的自信动摇了。他会退缩的。我知道他会退缩。我残废了。我不想让他觉得我是某种怪物：一个曾经美丽的机器，现在坏了。那只眼睛已经够糟糕了。她发现自己在他面前戴眼罩并不那么自豪。他让她时常不舒服地想起，她的视野曾经是二元的。

There was a soft knock on the doorway to the bathroom. Asuka glanced over through the steam. "Hey, I brought in your dress. You forgot that, too."  
浴室门口传来轻轻的敲击声。明日香透过蒸汽瞥了一眼。“嘿，我把你的裙子拿进来了。你也忘了这个。”

She cracked the sliding glass door and stuck one dripping arm out, expectantly.  
她推开滑动玻璃门，伸出一只滴着水的手臂，期待地等待着。

"I didn't _forget_, dummy," Asuka said making a beckoning motion with her fingers for the lotion, "I just didn't want to change when a pervert like you could look right into the ba-_AH!"_  
“我没忘，傻瓜，”明日香说着，用手指做出召唤的动作要乳液，“我只是不想在像你这样的变态能直接看到浴室的时候换衣服——啊！”

Blind to the outside, trapped with her arm halfway through the door, Asuka gasped at the soft, velvet sensation of Shinji's lips taking her pointer finger into his mouth.  
对外界视而不见，手臂卡在门中间，明日香对真嗣柔软天鹅绒般的嘴唇含住她的食指感到一阵惊愕。

Her immediate response was to jerk her hand back, but Shinji had a firm grasp on her wrist, and any other sort of action would open the shower door. She was completely helpless as Shinji gently ran his tongue down the length of her finger, bringing up a second as he slowly slid back down to her knuckles. Asuka gasped for air. Her legs were jelly. She grabbed onto the far shower wall for support.  
她本能地想抽回手，但真嗣紧紧抓住她的手腕，任何其他动作都会打开淋浴间的门。她完全无助地看着真嗣温柔地用舌头沿着她的手指滑动，又含住第二根手指，缓缓滑至指节。明日香喘不过气来，双腿发软，只能抓住远处的淋浴墙以支撑自己。

Shinji slowly swirled his tongue around her two fingers one more time before he removed his mouth and placed a gentle kiss on the back of her hand. Then he placed the lotion into her hand.  
真嗣再次缓缓地用舌头环绕着她的两根手指，然后移开嘴，在她的手背上轻轻一吻。随后，他将乳液放入她的手中。

Asuka was completely dumbfounded. For several seconds, her naked arm stayed outside of the shower, dripping on the bathroom floor. Finally realizing that the ordeal was over, she meekly withdrew her appendage and closed the glass door completely.  
明日香完全愣住了。好几秒钟，她赤裸的手臂一直露在淋浴间外，水滴落在浴室地板上。最终意识到这场磨难已经结束，她怯生生地收回手臂，将玻璃门完全关闭。

She stood and looked out at the silhouette of Shinji on the other side of the glass. His expression was completely impossible to read, obscured by steam and the opaqueness of the barrier.  
她站起身，望向玻璃另一侧真嗣的轮廓。他的表情完全无法读懂，被蒸汽和屏障的不透明性所掩盖。

He turned to go, and Asuka called: "Hey, c-could you maybe close the door?" He paused in the doorway. "...please," she finished, gripping the facial cream in her palm.  
他转身要走，明日香喊道："嘿，你，你能把门关上吗？"他在门口停下。"...请吧，"她补充道，手中紧握着面霜。

There was a moment without movement, and then he exited, closing the door behind him. Asuka let out a massive breath she didn't realize she had been holding and placed the facial cream on the ledge in the shower next to her.  
有那么一刻，四周静止不动，随后他走了出去，关上了门。明日香长长地呼出一口气，她自己都没意识到刚才一直屏着呼吸，然后将面霜放在淋浴间她旁边的架子上。

She shook under the water, her mind buzzing with a thousand possibilities. _What the fuck just happened?!_  
她在水流下颤抖，脑海中充斥着无数的可能性。刚刚到底发生了什么鬼事？！

Lying down, her hands quickly found their way to her waiting wetness. Asuka slipped in the finger he had been sucking on and finished herself off in record time.  
躺下后，她的手迅速找到了等待中的湿润。明日香将他刚才吮吸的手指滑入，以创纪录的速度完成了自我满足。

---

"I can see what's happening," Touji said to Kensuke, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the German with his drink. She was wearing a red cheongsam dress and stared blankly out at the world, lost in thought.  
"我能看出发生了什么，" 冬二对真希说，手里拿着饮料，朝那个德国人模糊地指了指。她穿着一件红色的旗袍，目光空洞地凝视着外界，陷入了沉思。

She glanced up, tracking the progress of Shinji as he made his way across the party.  
她抬头望去，追踪着真嗣穿过派对的步伐。

"What?" Kensuke adjusted his glasses and looked at her.  
"什么？" 真希调整了一下眼镜，看向她。

"But they don't have a clue," Touji said. Shinji passed Asuka, blushing, but not making eye contact. He headed towards the stairs to the second story of the building.  
"但他们毫无头绪，" 冬二说道。真嗣红着脸从明日香身边走过，但没有与她对视。他朝着通往建筑二楼的楼梯走去。

Asuka stared in front of her for a moment, the drink shaking in her hand.  
明日香盯着前方片刻，手中的饮料在她手中微微颤抖。

"Who?" Kensuke pointed at the couple. "Shinji and-?"  
"谁？" 健介指着那对情侣。"真嗣和——？"

"They'll fall in love," Touji continued, "and here's the bottom line: our trio's down to two."  
"他们会坠入爱河，" 冬二继续说道，"而底线是：我们的三人组只剩下两个了。"

"Oh." _Well, yeah._ Kensuke thought. _That's been happening for a while now._  
"哦。" 嗯，没错。剑介心想。这事已经发生一段时间了。"

Across the way, Asuka lifted her beer and finished it in a single, long drink. She put her glass on the table, wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, and set off after Shinji.  
对面，明日香举起啤酒，一口气喝完。她把杯子放在桌上，用手背抹了抹嘴，然后起身追向真嗣。

Touji pointed out the window to where snow was falling past a crescent moon.  
冬二指着窗外，那里雪花正飘过一弯新月。

"The sweet caress of twilight!"  
“黄昏的温柔轻抚！”

"...uh, Touji?" “……呃，冬二？”

"There's magic everywhere!"  
"到处都是魔法！"

"Are you drunk?" "你喝醉了吗？"

"And with all this _romantic_ atmosphere," Touji turned slowly, pointing his finger accusingly at Kensuke. He prodded the tip of the other boy's nose with each syllable to prove his point. "Dis-as-ter's in–"  
"在这种浪漫的氛围下，" 真嗣缓缓转身，用手指责备地指向健介。他每说一个音节就用指尖戳一下对方的鼻子，以证明自己的观点。"灾–难–就–要–来–了–"

The air outside of the party was cold, but not enough to dissuade Shinji from staying on the porch, staring out at the valley below. He heard the door shut behind him, and didn't have to turn to know who it was. His hands gripped the railing tighter, and he realized he had no idea what he was going to say to her.  
派对外的空气寒冷，但不足以让真嗣离开门廊，凝视着下方山谷。他听到身后的门关上，无需转身就知道是谁。他的双手更紧地抓住栏杆，意识到自己根本不知道该对她说些什么。

_What can I say to her?_ Shinji didn't even fully understand what the hell had happened back at their apartment, with her in the shower. The smell, and the closeness, and her painfully erotic, dripping arm, beckoning him closer. His mouth had been on her before he knew it, now he was honestly frightened of what was going to happen.  
我能对她说些什么呢？真嗣甚至不完全明白在他们公寓里发生了什么，当时她在淋浴。那气味，那亲近，她那痛苦而诱人的、滴水的手臂，召唤他靠近。他的嘴已经在她身上，而他还没意识到，现在他真的害怕接下来会发生什么。

Was she going to leave? _Please don't leave again..._  
她会离开吗？请不要再离开...

Shinji braced himself for a verbal thrashing.  
真嗣做好了被痛骂一顿的准备。

"Can I be completely honest with you?" Asuka's voice was quiet. He turned around to find her holding her arms, staring at him with what looked like a small tinge of fear. Vulnerable.  
“我能完全对你坦白吗？”明日香的声音很轻。他转过身，发现她抱着双臂，用一种似乎带着些许恐惧的眼神盯着他。显得很脆弱。

Shinji nodded absently. This was not what he was expecting. He thought this was going angry, yelling places, not... confessional honesty?  
真嗣心不在焉地点了点头。这并不是他预料中的情况。他以为会是愤怒、争吵的场面，而不是……坦白心声？

"I don't..." Asuka licked her lips, choosing her words carefully. "...want this."  
"我不想……" 明日香舔了舔嘴唇，小心翼翼地选择着词句。"……要这个。"

Shinji's breath caught in his throat. This already sounded like a goodbye. "What do you mean?"  
真嗣的呼吸卡在了喉咙里。这听起来已经像是一场告别。"你是什么意思？"

"This whole thing. What happened in that shower. Jeez. That's smut. It's like..." she waved her hands around in circles, looking for the words. "...bad fanfic smut."  
"这一切。淋浴间里发生的事。天哪。那简直是……"她挥舞着手臂，寻找着合适的词汇。"……糟糕的同人小说里的色情描写。"

Shinji blinked. "Like _what?_"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“像什么？”

"I don't want sex from you, idiot! I mean," Asuka rolled her eye, "I mean, I _do_. It's crazy how much I do, but not first. I want acceptance! I want love! I want you to hold me and make me feel like I'm home. I think everyone wants that..." She looked to the side, biting her lip.  
“我不要你的性，白痴！我是说，”明日香翻了个白眼，“我是说，我确实想要。我有多想要简直疯狂，但不是现在。我要的是接纳！我要的是爱！我要你抱着我，让我感觉像回到家一样。我想每个人都想要这个……”她侧过头，咬着嘴唇。

"Shinji, I feel so ugly now. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don't feel like myself. I don't feel confident or pretty or anything, I feel like a monster and that's... that's _new_ to me, okay? I don't really know how to handle it. I need a friend, you know? And you're my friend! I know you are, you're one of my best friends, but I don't want to feel like that anymore, and us fucking isn't going to make me feel like myself. It's going to make me feel used up."  
“真嗣，我现在觉得自己好丑。当我照镜子时，我感觉那不是我。我没有自信，也不觉得自己漂亮，什么都没有，我感觉自己像个怪物，这对我来说是新的体验，好吗？我真的不知道该怎么应对。我需要一个朋友，你知道吗？而你就是我的朋友！我知道你是，你是我最好的朋友之一，但我不想再有那种感觉了，我们做爱不会让我找回自己。那只会让我觉得自己被用完了。”

She looked back towards him and pointed her finger. "You're better than that, and I'm better than that, so I'm sorry, but I don't want this story. We've got one shot at this thing, and I swear on my life it's going to be the one thing we don't fuck up."  
她回头望向他，伸出手指。“你比我强，我也比你强，所以对不起，我不要这个故事。我们只有一次机会，我以生命起誓，这将是唯一我们不会搞砸的事情。”

Snow started to drift down between them.  
雪花开始在他们之间飘落。

Shinji stared at her, completely dumbfounded. He wished she could see herself right now. The truth was that she'd never looked more beautiful or confident in her life. "Asuka, what's a fanfic?"  
真嗣盯着她，完全目瞪口呆。他希望她能看到自己现在的样子。事实上，她从未像此刻这样美丽和自信。“明日香，什么是同人文？”

"This is," she smiled, finally looking up at me. "And goddamn it you're going to start it the right way. Go back to the start of this chapter and get your mind out of the gutter. Give us the ending we deserve."  
"这就是，" 她微笑着，终于抬头看向我。"该死的，你要用正确的方式开始。回到这一章的开头，把你的心思从那些低俗的地方收回来。给我们一个应得的结局。"

And so I did. 于是我照做了。

Because every monster deserves a home.  
因为每个怪物都值得有个家。

Shinji shivered underneath his blanket and wished that she would just damn well hurry back. The door to his room slid open and he watched as she ran towards the bed.  
真嗣在被子里瑟瑟发抖，只盼着她能快点回来。他房间的门滑开了，他看着她朝床边跑来。

"Hurry!" he hissed. “快点！”他低声催促。

"Move over!" Asuka yanked up the covers and slid down next to him as quickly as she could. Shinji pulled the covers tight around his back with marked annoyance. She had just taken the warm spot. "Hey I've got a great idea, guys!" Asuka was mumbling to herself, "Remember those fucking blackouts? Those were so fun when we were _kids_, weren't they? Let's do them again in winter, just because they're fun!" She scoweled and turned towards him, quaking. "Why do we still have these, again?"  
“挪过去点！”明日香猛地掀开被子，尽可能快地滑到他身边。真嗣带着明显的恼怒，紧紧拉住被子裹住自己的背。她刚刚抢走了暖和的位置。“嘿，我有个绝妙的主意，伙计们！”明日香自言自语，“还记得那些该死的停电吗？小时候多有趣啊，对吧？让我们冬天再来一次，就因为好玩！”她皱着眉头转向他，颤抖着。“我们为什么还留着这些，又来了？”

Shinji shrugged. "I don't know. You can get a little closer, you know."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我不知道。你可以再靠近一点，你知道的。”

"And chance you getting handsy? You watch yourself, Ikari. I know how y-your mind works..." Asuka trailed off.  
“然后让你动手动脚？你小心点，碇。我知道你——你的心思……”明日香话音渐弱。

There was a quiet darkness between them. Shinji put his arm around his roommate, and he felt her nestle in closer to his chest.  
他们之间弥漫着一种静谧的黑暗。真嗣将手臂搭在室友肩上，感觉到她更紧地依偎进他的胸膛。

"Mmn," she mumbled into his shirt. Shinji chuckled softly in the darkness.  
"嗯，" 她咕哝着埋进他的衬衫里。真嗣在黑暗中轻声笑了。

"What?" "什么？"

"I can hear your heart."  
"我能听到你的心跳。"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"No, I like it," she smiled. "It's nice..."  
"不，我喜欢，" 她微笑着说，"很美好……"

Shinji rested his head on top of hers and breathed in her hair. He was falling asleep when he heard her talk again. With his face on top of her head, he felt the vibrations move through her body.  
真嗣将头靠在她的头顶上，深深地吸了一口她的发香。他正要入睡时，又听到了她说话。他的脸贴在她的头上，感觉到震动通过她的身体传来。

"Can I be completely honest with you?"  
“我能完全对你坦白吗？”

He pulled back, looking down to see that Asuka was awake, and very serious. Shinji nodded.  
他退开一些，低头看到明日香醒着，而且非常严肃。真嗣点了点头。

"Always," he said. "总是，" 他说。

Asuka sat up in bed, looking down at him. This was new, for them. It had been her suggestion to share the bed when the blackout happened, and suddenly Shinji wondered if it had been for this moment. She looked down at him and let her hand drift along his cheek. Shinji felt her sizing him up.  
明日香从床上坐起来，低头看着他。对他们来说，这是新的体验。停电时是她提议共用一张床的，突然间，真嗣想知道这是否就是为了这一刻。她低头看着他，手轻轻拂过他的脸颊。真嗣感觉到她在打量他。

"You know what's funny?" she whispered, "Last time we shared a bed it ended really badly."  
"你知道什么有趣吗？" 她低声说，"上次我们同床共枕，结果真的很糟糕。"

Whatever it was, this was important to her. Shinji placed his hand on top of hers, meeting her gaze. He smiled at her. _It's okay,_ he thought.  
无论那是什么，对她来说都很重要。真嗣将手放在她的手上，与她对视。他向她微笑。没关系，他心想。

_I love you. I promise that I will never hurt you. Tell me what's wrong, and let me heal you. We can heal together, I swear.  
我爱你。我保证永远不会伤害你。告诉我哪里不对，让我来治愈你。我们可以一起治愈，我发誓。_

After a moment, he saw Asuka smile back.  
过了一会儿，他看到明日香回以微笑。

"Dummy," she whispered into the darkness, and then she removed her shirt.  
“傻瓜，”她对着黑暗低语，随后脱下了衬衫。
