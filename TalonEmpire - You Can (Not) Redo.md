世界在真嗣和明日香那次划时代的“彩虹之上”相遇前彻底颠倒了。他们发现自己在一个没有第二次冲击的世界里醒来，身处海滩，最初的互动颇为不快。在神之真嗣和明日香的协助下，他们逐渐了解彼此，坠入爱河，并意识到肩负的责任。

N: Hello everyone! This is the start of You can (not) redo, the direct sequel to NGE: Sincerely Yours. The first part of this chapter IS chapter 17 of Sincerely Yours, to make a smooth transition.
AN：大家好！这是《你不能重做》的开始，《真心为你》的直接续集。本章的第一部分是《真心为你》第 17 章，以便实现平滑过渡。

It is recommended to read NGE: Sincerely Yours (at least the epilogue) before reading this.
建议在阅读本文之前，先阅读《新世纪福音战士：真诚的您》（至少是后记）。

This story will be WAFF & Angst Humor & Parody Drama. (More or less in this order) Don't take the technical details too seriously!
这个故事将包含温馨、焦虑、幽默、讽刺和戏剧元素（大致按此顺序）。请不要太认真对待技术细节！

Some may think my fic is too light-hearted to be an EVA fanfic, however not only that's my main intention for this piece of fiction, but also the setting of this world doesn't really allow anything dark to happen. This isn't some post-impact world, nor it is in the middle of Angel wars. I simply want to give my favorite couple some happiness, as well as entertain my readers with a light-hearted and humorous pure love story with a full tsundere Asuka and manga & TV mix Shinji.
有些人可能认为我的同人文过于轻松，不像是《新世纪福音战士》的粉丝作品，但这正是我创作这篇小说的主要意图。这个世界并非末日后的景象，也不是天使战争的中心。我只想给我的最爱情侣一些幸福，同时为读者带来一个轻松幽默、充满纯爱的故事，主角是彻底的傲娇明日香和漫画与电视混合版的真嗣。

With that being said, I don't intend to make things smooth for them. Asuka and Shinji will have to overcome what all AsuShin couples have to overcome - their insecurities and past traumas.
话虽如此，我并不打算让他们一帆风顺。明日香和真嗣将不得不克服所有明日香与真嗣情侣必须面对的问题——他们的不安全感和过去的创伤。

### Chapter 1: Where are we?

Under the cerulean sky and scattered clouds, two human silhouettes laid on the beach beside the blue ocean. One of them was wearing a yellow sundress, a violet choker, and two red bead-shaped hair clips, the other wearing a school uniform with a white shirt and black trousers. The cool breeze of the sea wind gently blew across the two of them. The girl with yellow sundress stirred, opening her eyes slowly.
在蔚蓝的天空和散布的云朵下，两个人影躺在蓝色海洋旁的沙滩上。其中一人穿着黄色太阳裙，戴着紫色颈圈，还有两个红色珠子形状的发夹，另一人穿着校服，白衬衫配黑色裤子。海风轻柔地吹过两人。穿黄色太阳裙的女孩动了动，缓缓睁开眼睛。

Saying she was confused would be a heavy understatement.
说她感到困惑，这简直是轻描淡写。

The last thing she remembered was the ride on Over the Rainbow, and the next second she was here. Looking to her left, she saw something even more strange.
她记得的最后一件事是乘坐“彩虹之上”，下一秒她就在这里了。向左看去，她看到了更加奇怪的东西。

Two people, one in a red plug suit she recognized as hers, and another in white and blue plug suit. She blinked, and the two of them disappeared.
两个人，一个穿着她认出是自己的红色插入栓服，另一个穿着蓝白相间的插入栓服。她眨了眨眼，那两个人就消失了。

'Was that…me?' 那是……我吗？

Looking to her right, she saw a boy with dark-brown hair laying aside her, presumably sleeping.
她向右看去，发现一个深棕色头发的男孩躺在她旁边，似乎在睡觉。

Suddenly anger surged through her body. She just woke up on a beach, having no memory of how she got here, and laying aside a BOY whom she didn't recognize. The only logical explanation she could come up with at the moment was the boy somehow abducted her and took her here – she didn't dare to think what he might have done with her. Nothing appropriate she could think of.
突然，愤怒涌遍她的全身。她刚在海滩上醒来，完全不记得自己是怎么来到这里的，旁边还躺着一个她不认识的男孩。她当时能想到的唯一合理解释是，这个男孩不知怎么绑架了她并把她带到这里——她不敢去想他可能对她做了什么。她想不出任何合适的事情。

Before she could even realize she found her hands already clasping around the boy's throat. She tightened her grip, and the boy finally opened his eyes. She saw confusion, panic, fear, pain – and oxygen deprivation in his eyes.
在她意识到之前，她的双手已经紧紧掐住了男孩的脖子。她收紧了手，男孩终于睁开了眼睛。她从他的眼中看到了困惑、恐慌、恐惧、痛苦——还有缺氧的迹象。

She didn't think rationally. All she had in her mind was, 'I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.'
她没有理性思考。她脑子里只有一个念头：'我要杀了你。我要杀了你。我要杀了你。'

Suddenly she felt warmth on her left cheek. She found herself being caressed by the boy. Her mind was screaming to her to keep going, but there was an unspoken familiarity of the caress, and her body reacted on its own. She loosened her grip, allowing the boy to breathe.
突然，她感到左脸颊上有股温暖。她发现自己正被男孩抚摸着。她的内心在尖叫着让她继续，但那抚摸中有着一种不言而喻的熟悉感，她的身体不由自主地做出了反应。她松开了手，让男孩得以呼吸。

The boy panted heavily, trying to get as much oxygen as possible.
男孩大口喘着气，试图尽可能多地吸入氧气。

"How disgusting…" She murmured, "why is my body reacting this way?"
多么令人厌恶…" 她低声说道，"为什么我的身体会有这样的反应？

"I'm sorry…but, hmm, could you please get off me?" The boy suddenly spoke meekly after a few seconds of heavy panting.
"对不起…但是，嗯，你能从我身上下来吗？" 男孩在几秒钟的沉重喘息后突然怯懦地开口。

To her surprise, she immediately complied and rolled off his body, but she kept her death-glare directed at him. She could still see the fear in the boy's eyes, much to her satisfaction.
令她惊讶的是，她立刻照做了，从他身上滚了下来，但她的死亡凝视依旧锁定在他身上。她仍然能从男孩的眼中看到恐惧，这让她感到满意。

SLAP!

The boy rubbed his red cheek in surprise, "Hey! What was that for?"
男孩惊讶地揉着发红的脸颊，"嘿！这是为什么？"

"What do you think, dummkopf?" She yelled, "who the fuck are you and where the fuck are we?"
你怎么想的，傻瓜？" 她吼道，"你他妈的是谁，我们他妈的在哪儿？

Her words were a cue for him as the boy quickly looked around, a confused frown appeared on his face. "I… don't know?"
她的话对他是个提示，男孩迅速环顾四周，脸上露出困惑的皱眉。"我……不知道？"

"Don't bullshit me, asshole! You took me here and must've raped me! I should've killed you just then!" She said as she once again leaped forward, pinning the boy on the beach, "Speak what you know, or I'll kill you right now!"
别跟我胡扯，混蛋！你把我带到这里，肯定强奸了我！我刚才就应该杀了你！" 她说着再次扑向前，将男孩按在沙滩上，"说出你知道的，否则我现在就杀了你！

"Wha-what? What are you talking about? I-what?" The boy panicked, "Hey, I just woke up here you strangling me! It's more like you wanted to rape me, not me you!"
什-什么？你在说什么？我-什么？" 男孩慌了，"嘿，我只是在这里醒来，你正掐着我！更像是你要强奸我，而不是我强奸你！

She didn't want to believe it, but her mind was telling her that he was telling the truth. So she slapped him again and stood up. "Then what do you remember?"
她不愿相信，但内心告诉她他说的可能是真的。于是她又给了他一巴掌，然后站起身来。“那你还记得什么？”

"Why should I tell you? I can't trust someone who tried to kill me!"
“我为什么要告诉你？我无法信任一个曾试图杀我的人！”

"Listen, I don't give a shit about your trust, I only care about what happened to me!" She shouted, "okay, I'll tell you my story. I was on a ship, and the next second I woke up here! You laying aside me!" She took a deep breath, "and you blame me for trying to kill you?"
“听着，我不在乎你的信任，我只关心发生了什么！”她吼道，“好吧，我告诉你我的经历。我在一艘船上，下一秒我就醒来了，发现你躺在我旁边！”她深吸一口气，“你还怪我试图杀你？”

The boy gulped, "I…sorry. But I can say I have a similar experience as you. I was on a helicopter…and the next second I woke up here, you strangling me."
男孩咽了口唾沫，“我……对不起。但我可以说我也有类似的经历。我原本在直升机上……下一秒我就醒来了，你正掐着我。”

"What? How is that possible?" She said dumbfounded, "You are not suggesting that we both got drugged and dropped here, are you?"
什么？这怎么可能？"她惊愕地说，"你不会是说我们俩都被下了药然后被丢到这里来了吧？

"I… don't know?" He frowned, "how can I know something like that?"
我……不知道？"他皱眉道，"我怎么可能知道这种事？

She closed her eyes, trying to think rationally. Damn, she had a college degree! The last thing she wanted to do now was to let emotions, not logic, guide her actions. Normally she didn't exactly put effort into controlling her temper, but under stressful situations like this, she needed to think.
她闭上眼睛，试图理性思考。该死，她可是有大学学位的！现在最不想做的就是让情绪而非逻辑主导自己的行为。通常她并不特别努力控制自己的脾气，但在这种压力情境下，她需要思考。

'If we ARE both drugged and sent here, there must be some common features among us. Might as well ask him a few questions. But I need to make the first step, considering I did try to kill him.' She thought. Turning to look at the very confused boy, she spoke. "Asuka."
'如果我们真的都被下了药并被送到这里，我们之间一定有某些共同点。不妨问问他几个问题。但我得先迈出第一步，毕竟我曾试图杀了他。'她想。转向那个一脸困惑的男孩，她开口道："我是明日香。"

"Huh?" 啊？

"My name, Asuka! Are you stupid or something?" Asuka sighed, "What's your name?"
我叫明日香！你是傻还是怎么的？" 明日香叹了口气，"你叫什么名字？

"Oh…sorry. I'm Shinji." 哦……对不起。我叫真嗣。

"Hmmm…sounds like a Baka." She commented, eliciting a grumble from the boy.
"嗯……听起来像个笨蛋。" 她评论道，引得男孩嘟囔了一声。

Asuka sighed. It seemed like the venom of the boy had completely disappeared – it was more interesting that way. She also figured that a boy like him wasn't the kind of person who's so sheepish would have the guts to rape a girl. "C'mon, stand up!"
明日香叹了口气。男孩的毒舌似乎完全消失了——这样更有趣。她也认为，像他这样的男孩，不是那种胆小到敢强奸女孩的人。“快点，站起来！”

"What for?" Shinji asked, but his body complying her order.
“为什么？” 真嗣问道，但身体却服从了她的命令。

"Anta Baka? I'm going to find a police station!" She grabbed Shinji's wrist and began dragging him away from the beach.
“你傻吗？我要去找警察局！” 她抓住真嗣的手腕，开始将他从海滩拖走。

Shinji panicked, "Po…police station?" He swallowed, his voice panicking, "are you gonna turn me in?"
真嗣慌了，“警……警察局？” 他咽了口唾沫，声音带着恐慌，“你要把我交给警察吗？”

"Yes! I mean, no, but yes. Arghhhhh," Asuka groaned, "we need to know what exactly happened, don't we? And we can't just stay on the beach! We need HELP!" she paused for a second, wondering where did that come from. She was strong. She didn't need help. But the situation was far beyond her comprehension, so a little…assistance from local authorities wouldn't hurt. "And it won't be too late to turn you in after we know what happened – if you actually did something!"
是的！我是说，不，但是是的。啊啊啊，" 明日香呻吟道，"我们需要知道到底发生了什么，不是吗？我们也不能一直待在海滩上！我们需要帮助！" 她停顿了一下，不知道这念头从何而来。她很坚强。她不需要帮助。但情况远超她的理解，所以一点…来自当地当局的协助也无伤大雅。"等我们弄清楚发生了什么之后再把你交出去也不迟——如果你真的做了什么的话！

Shinji wanted to protest, but his words died in his throat.
真嗣想要抗议，但他的话卡在了喉咙里。

The duo walked in silence as they climbed up a hill, having a good view of the city. At first glance, although something seemed off, Shinji still recognized it as Tokyo-3, much to his relief.
两人默默地爬上了一座小山，从那里可以很好地俯瞰城市。乍一看，虽然有些不对劲，但真嗣还是认出了那是第三新东京市，这让他松了一口气。

"Baka, do you know this place?" Asuka asked irately, giving Shinji a side eye.
"笨蛋，你知道这个地方吗？" 明日香不悦地问道，斜眼瞥了真嗣一眼。

"Hmmm… it's Tokyo-3 I suppose, I live here actually." Shinji replied, not daring to look at the girl. He had never met a girl so beautiful yet so strong in personality. He didn't know what he felt about her, but one thing he was certain. He was afraid of her.
"嗯……我想是第三新东京市吧，我确实住在这里。" 真嗣回答道，不敢直视那个女孩。他从未遇到过如此美丽却又个性如此强烈的女孩。他不知道自己对她是什么感觉，但有一点他很确定。他害怕她。

"Tokyo-3…" 'Isn't this city where NERV Headquarters and the GeoFront are located? Great. I'll just tell the police I'm the Second Child, pilot of Evangelion Unit 02, and NERV employee they will contact NERV, and I will be safe. But I can't let this idiot here know who I am!' "Wunderbar. Now hurry up!"
第三新东京市……" '这不是 NERV 总部和 GeoFront 所在的城市吗？太好了。我就告诉警察我是第二适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员，以及 NERV 的员工，他们会联系 NERV，我就会安全了。但我不能让这个傻瓜知道我是谁！' "太棒了。快点！

Asuka didn't know why but she had butterflies in her stomach, feeling the sensation of having Shinji's wrist in her hands. The skin-to-skin contact with the boy was calming her down and making her warm inside. She hated this feeling; damn, she had just met this boy, and it wasn't clear whether he did anything indecent to her or not, but it seemed like she was already falling in lo-
明日香不知道为什么，但她的胃里好像有蝴蝶在飞，手里握着真嗣的手腕。与这个男孩的皮肤接触让她平静下来，内心感到温暖。她讨厌这种感觉；该死，她才刚遇到这个男孩，还不清楚他是否对她做了什么不妥的事，但似乎她已经开始坠入爱河了——

She violently shook it off and let go of Shinji's arm. "You can walk by yourself, just keep up with my pace!"
她猛地甩开这种念头，放开了真嗣的手臂。"你自己能走，跟上我的步伐就行！"

"Hm, okay." Shinji also felt warm and content inside just to be touched by her hands, but he was smart enough not to show any sign of enjoying this. This wasn't worth his life.
"嗯，好吧。" 被她的手触碰，碇真嗣内心也感到温暖和满足，但他足够聪明，没有表现出任何享受的迹象。这还不值得他冒险。

After several hours of jogging, they finally reached a relatively busy area of Tokyo-3. Asuka started wandering around aimlessly; she didn't know the city at all, but she was too proud to admit she was lost. After they passed the same crossing thrice, Shinji finally said, "Hm, Asuka?"
经过几个小时的慢跑，他们终于到达了东京-3 中一个相对繁忙的地区。明日香开始漫无目的地闲逛；她对这座城市一无所知，但又太骄傲，不愿承认自己迷路了。当他们第三次经过同一个十字路口时，真嗣终于开口说："嗯，明日香？"

"What is it?" She barked, annoyed by her own incompetence.
"什么事？" 她咆哮道，对自己的无能感到恼火。

"Are you…lost? It's the third time we've seen this crossing…" Shinji answered cautiously.
"你是不是……迷路了？这已经是我们第三次看到这个十字路口了……" 真嗣小心翼翼地回答。

"Baka! Do you doubt my abilities?" Asuka spatted angrily.
"笨蛋！你怀疑我的能力吗？" 明日香愤怒地反驳道。

Shinji swallowed, unable to meet her glare, "N-no! I'm just saying…I know you'll find it eventually, but I know this place! It will just make things easier if you let me find the way…"
真嗣吞了吞口水，不敢直视她的目光，"不，不是的！我只是说……我知道你最终会找到的，但我熟悉这个地方！如果你让我带路，事情会简单得多……"

Hard to admit as it was, Asuka gave in and sighed, "Fine, whatever. Lead the way, then." She paused for one second and added, "but if you're trying to take me to some brothel… YOU'LL BE A DEAD MAN!"
尽管难以启齿，明日香还是妥协了，叹了口气，"好吧，随你。那就带路吧。" 她停顿了一秒，补充道，"但如果你敢带我去什么妓院……你就死定了！"

Although Shinji was annoyed by her self-centered attitude, he was nothing but polite. So instead of a retort he simply said, "Hai, hai."
尽管真嗣对她的自我中心态度感到恼火，但他依然保持着礼貌。他没有反驳，只是简单地回答，"好的，好的。"

"Hmph!" 哼！

Shinji was really scared. This day hadn't been making any sense to him. He wanted Misato to help him get out of this, but he couldn't find his phone. He wanted to see his friends and maybe have fun at the arcade. Hell, even doing a sync test would be much better than being stuck with a beautiful yet scary girl who thought he…molested her.
真嗣真的吓坏了。这一天对他来说毫无意义。他希望美里能帮他摆脱这种困境，但他找不到自己的手机。他想见见朋友，或许在游戏厅里找点乐子。天哪，哪怕是进行同步测试也比和一个既美丽又可怕的女孩困在一起好，她认为他……猥亵了她。

For sure he could run away at any time, but his curiosity about the situation and the girl was keeping him here. There was an unspoken familiarity of the girl, and he was attracted to her. He had absolutely no idea of where that attraction came from. He justified it as he was only attracted to her beauty.
他当然可以随时逃跑，但对情况和女孩的好奇心让他留了下来。女孩有一种不言而喻的熟悉感，他被她吸引。他完全不知道这种吸引力从何而来。他将其归因于只是被她的美貌所吸引。

Walking three blocks down the street, Shinji finally found a police station. Asuka grabbed his wrist again and dragged him into it, preventing him from escaping.
沿着街道走了三个街区，真嗣终于找到了一个警察局。明日香再次抓住他的手腕，把他拖了进去，防止他逃跑。

"Hello, Mister, Hello Miss, what can I do for you?" The police officer asked.
"你好，先生，你好，小姐，有什么可以帮到你们的吗？" 警察问道。

"I'm lost." Asuka said, although she didn't want to admit it.
"我迷路了。" 明日香说，尽管她不想承认。

"Hmmm…where do you live in this city?" The police officer asked, taking out some kind of document from his desk, his eyes kept switching between Asuka and the document, which made her cringe.
"嗯……你在这个城市住在哪里？" 警察问道，从他的桌子上拿出一份文件，他的眼睛在明日香和文件之间来回切换，这让她感到不安。

"I don't live here! That's why I'm lost," Asuka said, getting annoyed.
"我不住在这里！这就是我迷路的原因，" 明日香说，开始感到恼火。

"So I guess you're not Japanese, either," The police officer put down his document, narrowing his eyes.
"所以我想你也不是日本人吧，"警察放下文件，眯起了眼睛。

"No shit Sherlock!" She suddenly realized there's something important she could ask, "What's today's date?"
废话！"她突然意识到有个重要问题可以问，"今天是几号？

"May fifteenth, 2016," the police officer replied and continued checking his document.
"2016 年 5 月 15 日，"警察回答道，并继续查阅他的文件。

Both Shinji and Asuka blinked. They just missed almost nine months of their life. They couldn't believe it.
真嗣和明日香都眨了眨眼。他们几乎错过了九个月的生活。他们简直不敢相信。

"Wait for a second here," the police said, turning around and left the office.
"在这里等一下，"警察说着，转身离开了办公室。

"Hey! You can't just leave like that!" Asuka yelled and slammed her fist on the counter, drawing attention from other people in the room.
"嘿！你不能就这样离开！"明日香大声喊道，并猛地一拳砸在柜台上，引起了房间里其他人的注意。

Shinji was so embarrassed, "Asuka! Calm down!"
真嗣感到非常尴尬，"明日香！冷静点！"

"Shut up you!" Asuka turned around to face Shinji, "YOU are to blame for this! YOU are at fault!"
闭嘴！"明日香转过身来面对真嗣，"这都是你的错！你才是罪魁祸首！

"Hey, how is any of this MY fault?" Shinji was also getting on the edge from the frustration, "I had NO idea of what happened, either!"
嘿，这怎么就成了我的错？" 真嗣也因为沮丧而濒临崩溃，"我也不知道发生了什么，真的！

"I just KNOW this is somehow ALL your fault! What's the odds of us waking up on a beach like that? And apparently I lost nine months of memory! It doesn't just happen!"
我就知道这肯定是你的错！我们怎么会那样醒来在海滩上？而且我显然失去了九个月的记忆！这种事不会无缘无故发生的！

"This doesn't sound very convincing!"
这听起来不太有说服力！

"What is your theory, then? What the fuck actually happened?"
那你的理论是什么？到底发生了什么鬼事情？

"How am I supposed to know?"
我怎么会知道呢？

"You are pathetic!" 你真可悲！

"You are unreasonable!" 你太不讲理了！

While Shinji and Asuka were arguing, the people inside the room simply shrugged, chuckled, or rolled their eyes. From their perspective, it was nothing more than a childish argument.
当真嗣和明日香争吵时，房间里的人们只是耸耸肩，轻笑或翻白眼。从他们的角度来看，这不过是场幼稚的争执。

Just as Asuka was about to make another angry retort, two men wearing black suits and sunglasses stepped inside and spoke, "Miss, please come with us."
就在明日香正要再次愤怒反驳时，两个身穿黑色西装、戴着墨镜的男人走了进来，说道：“小姐，请跟我们走一趟。”

Asuka turned her glare to the men, "Who the fuck are you? Why should I listen?"
明日香将怒视转向那两个男人，“你们他妈的是谁？我为什么要听你们的？”

The men didn't say anything; the one on the right nodded to the one on the left, and he took out an ID card.
那两个男人没有说话；右边的那位向左边的点了点头，后者随即掏出了一张身份证件。

It read 'Gehirn – Section 2 Agent Yamada'.
证件上写着“Gehirn – 第二部门特工山田”。

Asuka's eyes widened, but she quickly composed herself. She knew what Gehirn was – the predecessor of NERV, where her mother used to be working at. She was curious how it still existed, but since nothing had been making sense to her, she decided to believe the thing she was most familiar with. "Mein Gott finally someone reliable here!" She turned to look at Shinji, "This ain't over, dummkopf!" She then left accompanied by the two agents.
明日香的眼睛睁大了，但她很快恢复了镇定。她知道 Gehirn 是什么——NERV 的前身，她母亲曾经工作的地方。她好奇它怎么还存在，但既然一切都让她感到困惑，她决定相信自己最熟悉的事物。“我的天，终于有个可靠的人了！”她转向真嗣，“这事还没完，傻瓜！”随后她在两名特工的陪同下离开了。

Shinji, alone in the police station, didn't what to feel. For one, he was relieved that he was finally freed from the Red Devil; for another, he was starting to…feel empty inside. 'This doesn't make any sense,' He thought, 'I should be happy she finally left me alone, but why am I feeling empty after she's gone?' Shaking it off, he left the police station as well and walked towards Misato's apartment.
真嗣独自在警察局里，不知道该有什么感觉。一方面，他终于摆脱了红魔女的束缚，感到松了一口气；另一方面，他开始感到内心空虚。‘这说不通，’他想，‘我应该为她的离开而高兴，但为什么她一走我就感到空虚呢？’他摇摇头，也离开了警察局，向着美里家走去。

Too bad he didn't notice the content on the ID card.
可惜他没注意到身份证上的内容。

Deep underground, in the still darkness, twelve black monoliths emerged, circling around a lonely figure sitting on the chair, his hands clasped together, supporting his chin.
在深邃的地下，寂静的黑暗中，十二块黑色巨石浮现，围绕着孤独坐在椅子上的身影，他的双手紧握，支撑着下巴。

The monolith had 'SEELE 01 – SOUND ONLY' on it spoke first, "It seems the Dead Sea Scroll's predictions are accurate."
刻有'SEELE 01 – 仅限声音'的巨石首先开口：“看来死海古卷的预言是准确的。”

"Indeed. It predicted that today, 'fire from sky, water from sky, shall arrive upon earth, the key to human salvation." SEELE 03 spoke.
“确实如此。它预言了今天，‘天降火雨，天降水雨，将降临地球，成为人类救赎的关键。’”SEELE 03 说道。

"Are you sure the girl you found in that police station is the one described by the Dead Sea Scrolls?" SEELE 04 asked.
“你确定在那个警察局找到的女孩就是死海古卷所描述的那个人吗？”SEELE 04 问道。

"The police checked the files – she matches the description we gave him, and he also said her face wasn't even recorded in the national security database – which means she either smuggled in Japan, or she DID 'fell from sky' – just like the Dead Sea Scrolls described." SEELE 08 spoke.
"警方查看了档案——她与我们提供的描述相符，而且他还说她的面容甚至未被录入国家安全数据库——这意味着她要么是偷渡到日本的，要么她确实是‘从天而降’——正如死海古卷所描述的那样。" SEELE 08 说道。

"I doubt a girl as young as her could survive smuggling," SEELE 05 mocked, "she must be the one."
我不相信一个像她这么年轻的女孩能挺过偷渡，" SEELE 05 嘲讽道，"她肯定就是那个人。

"What are your thoughts on this, Ikari?" SEELE 01 asked.
"碇，你怎么看这件事？" SEELE 01 问道。

The man who had his chin supported by his clasped hands spoke, "We shall treat her as one of The Two for now."
那位用手托着下巴的男子开口道："目前我们就将她视为那两人之一来对待。"

"If she really is one of The Two, then it's safe to assume she doesn't have a legal identity," SEELE 11 complemented.
"如果她真的是 The Two 之一，那么可以安全地假设她没有合法身份。"SEELE 11 补充道。

"That we will arrange. What is the progress of finding 'water from sky'?" Gendo asked.
"我们会安排的。寻找'天降之水'的进展如何？"源堂问道。

"There was a boy alongside her, but we can't know for sure." SEELE 07 said.
"她身边有一个男孩，但我们无法确定。"SEELE 07 说。

"Send Section 2 agents in for surveillance. Twenty - four – seven. Don't let him escape." Gendo Ikari ordered.
"派遣第二课特工进行监视，全天候。别让他逃了。"源堂命令道。

"Now we have proof that the Dead Sea Scrolls are reliable – we can move forward with our scenario immediately." SEELE 01 spoke, his tone just carried a little bit of joyfulness.
"现在我们有证据证明死海古卷是可靠的——我们可以立即推进我们的计划。" SEELE 01 说道，他的语气中带着一丝喜悦。

"That's why we've been building this underground structure above the black moon," Gendo said, "when do we plan to initiate contact experiment with Adam?"
这就是为什么我们一直在黑月上方建造这个地下结构，" 源堂说，"我们打算何时与亚当进行接触实验？

"We still need several months for preparations," SEELE 09 spoke, "Dr. Katsuragi isn't ready yet."
我们还需要几个月的准备时间，" SEELE 09 说，"葛城博士还没有准备好。

"Suit yourself," Gendo said, cutting off the communication.
"随你便，" 源堂说，切断了通讯。

The twelve monoliths disappeared, and the lights lit up, revealing another girl with blue hair and red eyes in the room. "Rei," Gendo spoke, "I won't be able to go home and have dinner tonight. You can have dinner with mom. Don't wait for me."
十二块巨石消失了，灯光亮起，房间里显现出另一位蓝发红眼的女孩。"绫波，"源渡开口道，"今晚我回不了家吃晚饭了。你可以和妈妈一起吃。别等我了。"

"Yes, papa." 好的，爸爸。

XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The black SUV screeched to a halt in front of a tall building, the sign above the main door read 'Gehirn Japan'. Asuka followed the agents into the building and into an office. "Wait here." One of the agents said, and left the room with his colleague. Asuka cursed in German as she was once again left alone in somewhere alien, just to meet someone she totally didn't expect to see. Lavender hair, dark eyes, red jacket-
黑色 SUV 猛地停在一座高楼前，大门上方的招牌写着'Gehirn 日本分部'。明日香跟随特工们进入大楼，来到一间办公室。"在这儿等着。"一名特工说道，随后与同事离开了房间。明日香用德语咒骂着，又一次被留在陌生的地方，只为见一个她完全没料到会遇见的人。淡紫色的头发，深邃的眼睛，红色夹克——

"M-Misato?" Asuka cried in surprise. She was confused, but also happy that she finally met someone she knew.
"M-Misato?" 明日香惊讶地喊道。她感到困惑，但也很高兴终于遇到了一个她认识的人。

Misato Katsuragi blinked, "Hello, kid, but how do you know my name?"
葛城美里眨了眨眼，"你好，孩子，不过你怎么知道我的名字？"

Now it's time for Asuka to blink. She was having a turmoil of thoughts in her head. If she followed her instinct, she would say something like 'you were my guardian years ago,' but she knew Misato wasn't joking. She could see genuine confusion in Misato's eyes. She bet she looked the same. Her college-level intelligence kicked in, trying to find every excuse possible-
现在轮到明日香眨眼了。她的脑海中思绪纷乱。如果她跟随直觉，她会说'你多年前是我的监护人'，但她知道美里不是在开玩笑。她能从美里的眼中看到真正的困惑。她敢打赌自己看起来也是一样。她的大学水平智力开始发挥作用，试图找到每一个可能的借口——

"I saw it on your ID," Asuka said, trying hard not to stutter.
"我在你的身份证上看到的，" 明日香说，努力不让自己结巴。

Misato looked down to her chest, indeed there was a nameplate clipped onto her jacket. She chuckled nervously, "ha, I was wondering. Nice to meet you, kid. I'm Misato Katsuragi. What about you?"
碇真嗣低头看向自己的胸前，确实有一个名牌夹在夹克上。她紧张地笑了笑，“哈，我还在想呢。很高兴见到你，孩子。我是葛城美里。你呢？”

"I'm Asuka La…" She quickly stopped herself from blurting out her whole name. Up until now she was certain that this world wasn't the world she was familiar with. It wouldn't hurt to lie about her name, in fact it would provide a temporary cover. Just as she was thinking of a name, suddenly the word 'Shikinami' popped up in her mind. It felt strange – she didn't exactly come up with that surname, it's more like someone inserted that name into her head, but she decided to go with it. "Asuka Shikinami. Nice to meet you too!"
“我是惣流……”她迅速停下，没有说出全名。直到现在，她确信这个世界不是她所熟悉的世界。撒个谎关于她的名字也无妨，实际上这会提供一个临时的掩护。正当她在想一个名字时，突然间“式波”这个词出现在她的脑海中。感觉很奇怪——她并没有真正想出这个姓氏，更像是有人将这个名字植入她的脑海，但她决定采用它。“式波·明日香。也很高兴见到你！”

"Asuka Shikinami…nice name," Misato smiled, "now, back to business. Do you know what is this place, and why we want you here?"
“式波·明日香……好名字，”美里微笑着说，“那么，回到正题。你知道这是什么地方，以及为什么我们要你来这里吗？”

"Not a clue." She was telling half the truth. She knew what Gehirn was, but she had no idea her purpose here. Probably something EVA related.
“一无所知。”她说的半真半假。她知道 GEHIRN 是什么，但她完全不知道自己来这里的目的。可能与 EVA 有关。

"Fair enough. This place is called Gehirn, a German word for 'brain'. It's tasked with the research and development of bioengineering and artificial evolution. Gehirn's Headquarters is in Germany. While we had enough resources to do something magnificent, we built Tokyo-3 – this city - and the Magi supercomputer," Misato explained, "I can only tell you so much right now. Now, about you," Asuka tensed up, "we want you to help us on our newest research program, human–computer neural link interaction. Project E."
说得通。这个地方叫做 Gehirn，是德语中'大脑'的意思。它的任务是研究和开发生物工程和人工进化。Gehirn 的总部位于德国。尽管我们有足够的资源去做一些伟大的事情，我们建造了第三新东京市——这座城市——以及 Magi 超级计算机，" 葛城解释道，"我现在只能告诉你这么多。现在，关于你，" 明日香紧张起来，"我们希望你能帮助我们进行最新的研究项目，人机神经链接交互。E 计划。

Asuka was on the edge of tears. Her life's purpose was to pilot an EVA. Now it seemed like Angels weren't even a thing in this world. She was totally expecting Misato to ask her to pilot an EVA since it was her natural talent, but apparently, her last hope in this strange new world was shattered. Looking on the bright side, at least she was still useful – if Gehirn didn't offer her a job, eventually she would probably be lying somewhere desolate and bleeding out.
明日香几乎要哭出来了。她一生的目标就是驾驶 EVA。现在看来，在这个世界里，使徒似乎根本不存在。她满心期待葛城会让她驾驶 EVA，因为那是她的天赋，但显然，她在这个陌生新世界中的最后希望破灭了。往好处想，至少她仍然有用武之地——如果 Gehirn 没有给她提供工作，她最终可能会躺在某个荒凉的地方，流血至死。

"I accept your offer," her voice just a little shaky, "what exactly do I need to do?" 'And somehow, all of these are that idiot's fault!'
"我接受你的提议，" 她的声音略带颤抖，"我具体需要做什么？" '而且，所有这些似乎都是那个笨蛋的错！'

"First things first, if you really made up your mind, we need to sign a contract, then we can get into details," Misato kept her professionalism, pulling out a pack of documents, "please read through it and sign at the bottom."
首先，如果你真的下定决心了，我们需要先签一份合同，然后才能讨论细节。" 碇真嗣保持着专业态度，拿出了一叠文件，"请仔细阅读并在底部签字。

While Asuka was reading the contract, Misato was immersed in her own thoughts. 'It looked like there's something on Asuka's mind. I wonder what it is. Employing this new girl is a direct order from Commander Ikari, how odd. He must know something about this girl. And I intend to figure it out. The best way to interact with her constantly is to get her by my side.'
当明日香在阅读合同时，碇真嗣沉浸在自己的思绪中。'看起来明日香心里有事。我想知道是什么。雇佣这个新女孩是伊卡洛斯指挥官的直接命令，真奇怪。他一定知道关于这个女孩的一些事情。我打算弄清楚。与她不断互动的最好方式就是让她留在我身边。'

"Done," after a careful read-through of the contract and found no loopholes, Asuka signed on it.
"完成了，" 经过仔细阅读合同并确认没有漏洞后，明日香在上面签了字。

Misato picked up the contract and checked the signature, "Good. Now, about your living arrangements. You know that I'm your legal guardian from now on, right?"
碇真嗣拿起合同检查了签名，"好的。现在，关于你的住宿安排。你知道从现在起我就是你的法定监护人了吧？"

"I know that perfectly well," Asuka replied. She was happy to have Misato being her guardian again, although she was wondering whether Kaji was somewhere around.
"我对此一清二楚，" 明日香回答道。她很高兴再次由美里担任她的监护人，尽管她也在想卡吉是否就在附近。

"Great. Do you have any parents?"
很好。你有父母吗？

Asuka's eyes twitched, "Not really. It's not like I need them!"
明日香的眼睛抽搐了一下，"并不真的有。我又不需要他们！"

"I'm…sorry to hear that," Misato said as she saw Asuka's face clouded, tears seemed to form around her eyes.
"我……很遗憾听到这个，" 美里说，她看到明日香的脸色阴沉，泪水似乎在眼眶中打转。

"It's okay." 'I'm strong. I'm not some helpless little girl! I'm not gonna cry!'
没关系。我很坚强，不是无助的小女孩！我不会哭的！

"Then it's settled!" Misato said happily, stretching her arms, "you'll be living with me from now on!"
那就这么定了！" 美里开心地说道，伸了个懒腰，"从今往后你就和我一起住了！

Shinji had been wandering around Tokyo-3 for almost two hours since he left the police station. The city was very similar to the Tokyo-3 he knew, but something was just off, which he couldn't tell. His general direction was Misato's apartment – but after seeing the differences of the city, he was very sure this world wasn't the world he knew. Those weren't the kind of changes that could happen in nine months – so he shook the thought off. He didn't even know whether Misato existed in this world.
自从离开警察局，真嗣已经在第三新东京市徘徊了近两个小时。这座城市与他所熟悉的第三新东京市非常相似，但总觉得有些不对劲，却又说不上来。他大致的方向是美里的公寓——但看到城市的这些变化后，他非常确定这个世界不是他所认识的那个。这些变化不可能在九个月内发生——于是他打消了这个念头。他甚至不知道在这个世界里美里是否存在。

He then came to a very familiar place – the hill which Misato took him to overlook the cityscape. He looked down at the city after a careful examination of the landscape, he finally realized what was missing.
他随后到达了一个非常熟悉的地方——美里带他去俯瞰城市风光的那座山丘。他仔细审视了景色后，终于意识到缺少了什么。

The EVA launch shafts and weaponry buildings were not there.
初号机的发射井和武器建筑并不存在。

'So, is it safe to assume EVAs don't exist in this world?' He thought, 'Not that I want to pilot the EVA in the first place.'
“那么，可以认为在这个世界里 EVA 并不存在吗？”他想，“本来我也不想驾驶 EVA。”

Shinji sighed and left the hill – he figured there was one more place he could visit before checking Misato's apartment.
真嗣叹了口气，离开了山丘——他觉得在去美里公寓之前还有一个地方可以拜访。

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

After a short tour around Gehirn, Misato drove Asuka to her apartment. Although there were no Angels yet, they still built the GeoFront and the pyramidal Headquarters. It's just not called NERV.
在短暂游览了 Gehirn 之后，葛城美里开车将明日香送到了她的公寓。尽管还没有使徒出现，他们仍然建造了 GeoFront 和金字塔形的总部。只是它还不叫 NERV。

Asuka was staring out the window of Misato's car. 'Great, now I'm stuck living with this Misato again. I don't know how this Misato will be different from the Misato I know. I just hope this one is not a drunk slop.' She thought.
明日香正凝视着葛城美里车窗外。'太好了，现在我又得和这个美里住在一起了。我不知道这个美里和我认识的那个会有什么不同。我只希望这个不是个醉鬼。' 她想。

"Jeez, can you smile at all?" Misato asked. "You haven't smiled at all since I met you."
哎呀，你就不能笑一笑吗？" 美里问道。"自从我遇见你以来，你一次都没笑过。

"Can't imagine why is, can you?" Asuka muttered.
"想象不出为什么，你能吗？" 明日香喃喃自语。

Misato grimaced. "Fine," Sighing, "Don't forget that you'll start working the next Monday."
美里皱了皱眉。"好吧，" 她叹了口气，"别忘了你下周一就要开始工作了。"

"Yeah, yeah, whatever…what exactly do I need to do, though?"
嗯，嗯，随便吧……但我到底需要做什么呢？

"I'm not technicians, so I can't explain the details to you, but what I know is you'll be wearing some kind of skin-tight suit that's made of synthetic rubber, and sit in a plug." Asuka's face visibly lit up upon hearing these words, "Then you'll be connected to a simulator using neural links. We'll assign you multiple tasks to do in the simulator. Sounds fun to you?"
我不是技术人员，所以无法向你详细解释，但我知道你将穿上一种由合成橡胶制成的紧身衣，坐在一个插入栓里。" 听到这些话，明日香的脸明显亮了起来，"然后你将通过神经链接与模拟器连接。我们会给你分配多个模拟器中的任务。听起来对你来说有趣吗？

'Not exactly piloting an EVA, but close enough I guess,' "Wunderbar! I'm really interested!" Asuka exclaimed, "But why chose me?"
'并非真正驾驶 EVA，但也差不多了，' "太棒了！我真的很感兴趣！" 明日香兴奋地说，"但为什么选我呢？"

"I don't know the details, but it seemed only very few people's brains are able to connect with computers. And you are one of them! One in a billion!" Misato said enthusiastically.
"我不太清楚细节，但似乎只有极少数人的大脑能与计算机连接。而你就是其中之一！亿里挑一的！" 美里热情地说。

Asuka's ego was flying out of the sky, "What do you expect? I'm a genius after all. Are there other people doing this job?"
明日香的自我感觉好极了，"你期待什么呢？我毕竟是天才。还有其他人做这份工作吗？"

"Yes. There's another girl, she's the Commander's daughter." Misato answered, "Her name is Rei. Rei Ikari. She's the First Child."
是的。还有另一个女孩，她是指挥官的女儿。" 美里回答，"她的名字是绫波。绫波丽。她是第一适格者。

Asuka raised her eyebrows, 'not much is different, isn't it? First Child…Rei Ayanami, but here she's called Rei Ikari…I wonder what that means.' "Hmph, she's one daddy's girl. I bet she got the job through nepotism, not like me, who has talent and skills!"
明日香挑了挑眉毛，'没什么不同，不是吗？第一适格者……绫波丽，但在这里她被称为绫波零……我想知道这意味着什么。' "哼，她就是个爸爸的宝贝。我敢打赌她是通过裙带关系得到这份工作的，不像我，靠的是才华和技能！"

Misato gulped at her cockiness. "And I want my suit to be RED!"
看到她的自信，葛城美里不禁咽了口口水。"而且我要我的制服是红色的！"

Shinji headed towards Rei's apartment, hoping to at least find someone he knew and could talk to. To his surprise, the apartment block where Rei was supposed to be living was replaced by two-floor apartments, and it wasn't in a demolition zone anymore. In fact, it looked more like villas, not apartments.
真嗣朝着绫波的公寓走去，希望能找到至少一个他认识且可以交谈的人。令他惊讶的是，原本绫波应该居住的公寓楼已经被两层楼的住宅所取代，而且这里不再是拆迁区。实际上，它看起来更像是别墅，而非公寓。

This had proved to be a big problem for Shinji – he couldn't be sure whether Rei lived here anymore. He was deflated. He recalled all things that had happened the whole day. He woke up on a beach in a new world similar to the world he knew but different enough to make him lost, strangled by a beautiful, familiar, yet annoying redhead, and didn't what to do anymore.
这已证明对真嗣来说是个大问题——他无法确定绫波是否还住在这里。他感到沮丧。他回忆起一整天发生的所有事情。他在一个新世界的沙滩上醒来，这个世界与他所知的世界相似但又足够不同，让他感到迷茫，被一个美丽、熟悉却又恼人的红发女孩勒住，不知道该怎么办了。

He sighed and turned around, ready to go to Misato's apartment.
他叹了口气，转身准备去美里家。

Just to meet a pair of red eyes and blue hair. "Ayanami!" Shinji shouted, summoning all his willpower to not throwing himself at Rei. His fists clenched and unclenched in nervousness and joyfulness.
却迎面遇上了一双红眼睛和蓝头发。“绫波！”真嗣大喊，竭尽全力不让自己扑向绫波。他的拳头因紧张和喜悦而紧握又松开。

Rei blinked, "Mister…are you calling…me?"
绫波眨了眨眼，“先生……您是在叫我吗？”

Shinji gulped. His hopes shattered. Apparently, Rei didn't know him. He should've known. This was not his world. No one here should know who he was.
真嗣咽了口唾沫。他的希望破灭了。显然，绫波并不认识他。他早该明白的。这不是他的世界。这里没有人应该知道他是谁。

But at least he could try to befriend Rei, right? "Um, yes," Shinji said sweat dropping, "I-um-"
但至少他可以尝试和绫波成为朋友，对吧？“呃，是的，”真嗣说着，额头冒汗，“我-呃-”

"If you are trying to flirt with me then you're doing an awful job," Rei interrupted, "but I'm curious why did you call me 'Ayanami'?"
“如果你想和我调情，那你做得太糟糕了，”绫波打断他，“但我很好奇，你为什么叫我‘绫波’？”

"Oh, right. I-I don't know where it came from, not important anyway. I-"
“哦，对了。我-我不知道这从何而来，反正也不重要。我-”

"No, this is serious. No one should know that name. I am Rei Ikari," Shinji blinked, "' Ayanami' is my test subject codename. You shouldn't know it at all! Speak," Rei shot him a soul-piercing glare, "Who. Are. You?"
不，这是严肃的。没人应该知道那个名字。我是绫波丽，" 碇真嗣眨了眨眼，" '绫波' 是我的测试对象代号。你根本不应该知道它！说吧，" 绫波用一种穿透灵魂的目光瞪着他，"你。是。谁？

Shinji was having a turmoil of thoughts in his head, 'What the hell is Rei Ikari? Is she my father's daughter or something in this world? Damn,' however this made Shinji realized something else, 'does this mean my father…or at least someone looks and acts like Gendo Ikari exists in this world? I don't even know whether it's good or bad news. And she said 'Ayanami' is her test subject codename…I wonder what kind of test she's doing?' "I am…Shinji, Shinji…" 'I can't just say Shinji Ikari, can I? No, I have to make up a name…' Just as he was thinking of a name, suddenly the word 'Shikinami' popped up in his mind. It felt strange – he didn't exactly come up with that surname, it's more like someone inserted that name into his head, but he decided to go with it. "Shinji Shikinami," he said, "My name is Shinji Shikinami."
碇真嗣脑海中思绪纷乱，'绫波丽是什么鬼？她是这个世界里我父亲的女儿还是什么？该死，' 然而这让碇真嗣意识到了别的事情，'这是否意味着在这个世界里，我的父亲……或者至少一个外表和行为像碇源堂的人存在？我甚至不知道这是好消息还是坏消息。而且她说'绫波'是她的测试对象代号……我想知道她在进行什么样的测试？' "我是……真嗣，真嗣……" '我不能只说碇真嗣，对吧？不，我得编个名字……' 正当他在想名字时，突然脑海中冒出了'式波'这个词。这感觉很奇怪——他并没有特意想出这个姓氏，更像是有人把那个名字塞进了他的脑海，但他决定就用它。"式波真嗣，" 他说，"我的名字是式波真嗣。"

"That's not what I wanted to hear, Shikinami," Rei glared at him intently, "What. Is. Your. Purpose? Are you a spy?"
这不是我想听的，式波，" 绫波紧盯着他，"你。的。目的是什么？你是间谍吗？

"Wha-no! How am I a spy?" Shinji was transfixed.
"什么？不！我怎么会是间谍？" 碇真嗣愣住了。

"Then how do you know that name?"
那你怎么知道那个名字的？

"I-I-" Shinji was on the edge of a panic attack, "I don't know either! This place makes no sense! I know you, but she's not you!" He fell to the ground, face in his palms, "I don't know what to do…somebody please help me…"
我……我……" 碇真嗣濒临恐慌发作，"我也不知道！这个地方毫无逻辑！我认识你，但她不是你！" 他跌坐在地，双手掩面，"我不知道该怎么办……请谁来帮帮我……

Rei narrowed her eyes, 'Could this guy be one of The Two papa told me to look for? He certainly matches the physical description…and he seems very, very lost, too. Maybe I should ask Section 2 to send him to papa and let him judge.' She took out her phone and called Section 2 to pick Shinji up, then send him to Gehirn, and she left him for home.
绫波丽眯起眼睛，心想：'这家伙会不会就是爸爸让我找的那两个人之一？他确实符合外貌描述……而且看起来非常非常迷茫。或许我应该让第二部门把他送到爸爸那里，让爸爸来判断。' 她拿出手机，联系第二部门来接走碇真嗣，然后把他送往 GEHIRN，自己则回家了。

Misato pulled up to a large apartment building and parked in the vacant lot. By the time they arrived it was dark out, and the apartment was void of any lights. As the two got out of the car, Misato grabbed her coat from the back seat. "Do you want me to take your duffel bag?" Misato asked.
碇真嗣驾车来到一座大型公寓楼前，在空地上停好车。他们到达时天色已暗，公寓里没有一丝灯光。两人下车后，碇真嗣从后座拿起了自己的外套。“需要我帮你拿行李包吗？”碇真嗣问道。

"I can do this myself! I don't need help." Asuka said, eliciting a frown from Misato. 'I just want to help,' she thought.
“我自己能行！不需要帮忙。”明日香说道，让碇真嗣皱起了眉头。‘我只是想帮忙而已，’她心想。

The two quietly took the elevator up to the seventh floor where Misato lived. When it dinged, Asuka followed Misato out of the elevator into the open-air pathway to the apartment.
两人静悄悄地乘电梯到达七楼，那里是碇真嗣的住处。电梯叮的一声到达后，明日香跟着碇真嗣走出电梯，穿过露天走廊前往公寓。

"Do you have any personal stuff waiting to be delivered?" Misato asked as she approached the door.
"你有没有个人物品等着送来？" 渚薰边问边走向门口。

Asuka clenched her teeth as she realized that all her personal stuff must be gone. "No. I don't have any. I may have to purchase a few."
明日香咬紧牙关，意识到她所有的个人物品肯定都不见了。"没有。我可能得买一些。"

"Okay, but do you have any money?" Misato opened the door and walked inside.
"好吧，但你有钱吗？" 渚薰打开门走了进去。

Another reminder of the cruel reality. "Not really."
残酷现实的又一提醒。"没多少。"

Misato narrowed her eyes.' This girl is odd. She has no parents, no personal belongings, and no…money? How the hell did she live through all these years, then? Just what the hell has she been through? And if she's an actual homeless orphan, how come her clothes are…tidy, at least. She looks really good in her yellow sundress…it just doesn't make any sense…' She shook it off as questions for another time. "I can give you one-third of your monthly salary as cash advance," Misato offered with a smile.
碇真嗣眯起了眼睛。'这个女孩真奇怪。她没有父母，没有个人物品，也没有……钱？那她这些年是怎么活下来的？她到底经历了什么？如果她真的是个无家可归的孤儿，为什么她的衣服……至少还算整洁。她穿着那件黄色太阳裙看起来真不错……这完全说不通……'她摇了摇头，把这些疑问留到以后再想。"我可以预支你月薪的三分之一作为现金。"碇真嗣微笑着提议。

To her surprise Asuka's lips actually seemed to curl up a bit, "I guess I'll accept it."
令她惊讶的是，明日香的嘴角似乎真的上扬了一点，"我想我会接受的。"

"Don't mind the mess, I only moved in last month." Misato said, "What's wrong Asuka, come on in!"
别介意这里的乱，我上个月才搬进来。"碇真嗣说，"怎么了，明日香，快进来吧！

Asuka stood frozen in the doorway, hesitating on entering the room. "I just…I hadn't really had a home since like, ever," Asuka said with a clouded face.
明日香站在门口，犹豫着是否要进入房间。"我只是……自从我记事起，我就没有真正意义上的家，"明日香面带阴霾地说。

"Don't be silly, Asuka." Misato tried her best to not give a pitiful look, "This is your home now too."
别傻了，明日香。" 美里尽力不让自己露出可怜的表情，"这里现在也是你的家了。

Asuka stepped cautiously over the threshold and into the apartment. "I'm home!" She said energetically, a smile appeared on her face. "Welcome home, Asuka." Misato said happily, finally seeing the girl smile. "Do you want anything to eat?"
明日香小心翼翼地跨过门槛，走进公寓。"我回来了！" 她精神饱满地说道，脸上露出了笑容。"欢迎回家，明日香。" 美里开心地说，终于看到女孩笑了。"你想吃点什么吗？"

"No, I'm just tired." Asuka said as she yawned. "Where can I sleep?"
不了，我只是累了。" 明日香打着哈欠说。"我可以在哪里睡觉？

"There's a room over there you can sleep in," Misato said as she went to the cabinets and pulled out an instant meal. "We'll have to get more food in a few days, I'm running low…and the room is a little messy, too…"
那边有个房间你可以睡，" 美里说着走向橱柜，拿出一份速食。"过几天我们得补充食物了，我快吃完了……而且房间也有点乱……

'Holy crap…' Asuka thought,' What happened here? She only moved in a month ago, and caused all… this?' She saw the pigsty all around her with discarded clothes, boxes, and instant meal containers mixed with garbage and empty bottles and cans all over the place.' I guess a drunk and sloppy Misato is a universal constant…' "You call this…A LITTLE MESSY? This is literally a GARBAGE DUMP!"
'天哪……' 明日香心想，'这里发生了什么？她才搬来一个月，就搞成……这样？' 她看到四周一片狼藉，到处是丢弃的衣服、箱子、速食容器，还有垃圾和空瓶空罐混杂其中。'看来醉酒又邋遢的葛城小姐是永恒不变的……' "你管这叫……有点乱？这简直就是垃圾场！"

Misato showed a remorseful and apologetic look, "Well…my job took most of my time…"
葛城露出悔恨和歉意的表情，"嗯……我的工作占用了大部分时间……"

Misato led Asuka to her room, which was clean, and flipped on the light. "This is your room Asuka, now get some sleep, and I'll see you in the morning. I can lend you one of my loose t-shirts if you want," Misato said.
葛城领着明日香来到她的房间，那里很干净，她打开了灯。"这是你的房间，明日香，现在去睡吧，明早见。如果你愿意，我可以借你一件我的宽松 T 恤，" 葛城说。

"Hmph. At least someone's educated," Asuka said, which Misato took it as a compliment. She took out a yellow t-shirt and a pair of blue shorts, handing them to Asuka, who accepted with a small smile.
"哼。至少还有人受过教育，" 明日香说，葛城把这话当作了夸奖。她拿出一件黄色 T 恤和一条蓝色短裤，递给明日香，后者带着一丝微笑接受了。

"Goodnight, Asuka. Sleep tight."
晚安，明日香。睡个好觉。

"Goodnight… Misato." Asuka said as she put changed into her sleeping attire and lay on her new bed. As Misato turned off the lights, Asuka started drifting off to sleep while staring at the unfamiliar ceiling above her.
"晚安……美里。" 明日香说着，换上睡衣，躺在新床上。当美里关掉灯时，明日香开始凝视着陌生的天花板，渐渐进入梦乡。

Shinji stared at the building in front of him, didn't know what to do. If his memory was correct, this building should be the entry to the GeoFront, but now it had a huge 'Gehirn Japan' imprinted on it. 'This world is so much different, but similar enough,' he thought, 'and I wonder what my purpose will be here.'
真嗣凝视着面前的建筑，不知所措。如果他的记忆无误，这座建筑应该是进入 GeoFront 的入口，但现在上面却印着巨大的“Gehirn 日本”字样。'这个世界如此不同，却又足够相似，' 他想，'我在这里的目的是什么呢？'

"The Commander wishes to see you in person," Agent Hiro said plainly, "please follow me, Mister."
指挥官希望亲自见您，" 特工广说得很平淡，"请跟我来，先生。

Shinji followed the man-in-black and entered an elevator. He then found out it was a train car, much like the ones he rode to NERV Headquarters. As the train car descended deeper down the ground, Shinji realized it WAS the GeoFront, even the pyramid was there – it's just not called NERV. It was understandable since Angels weren't a thing yet, and Gehirn wasn't exactly a military organization.
真嗣跟随这位黑衣人进入了电梯，随后发现那其实是一节列车车厢，与他前往 NERV 总部时乘坐的列车极为相似。随着列车车厢深入地下，真嗣意识到这里正是 GeoFront，连金字塔也在——只是不叫 NERV。这可以理解，因为天使尚未出现，而 Gehirn 也并非军事组织。

Although Shinji had seen GeoFront many times in the world he remembered, he was still amazed by the magnificent sight. During the 40 minutes ride down there, he couldn't keep his eyes away from the window. He still recognized several differences – there weren't any turrets, missile launchers, or weaponry buildings.
尽管真嗣在他记忆中的世界里多次见过 GeoFront，但眼前的壮丽景象仍让他惊叹不已。在长达 40 分钟的下行旅程中，他的目光始终无法从窗户移开。他还是注意到了一些差异——这里没有炮塔、导弹发射器或武器建筑。

"Who's the Commander, Hiro-san?" Shinji asked with butterflies in his stomach. He was half-anticipating, half-dreading the answer.
"广先生，指挥官是谁？" 真嗣问道，心中忐忑不安。他既期待又害怕听到答案。

"Gendo. The Commander is Gendo Ikari."
源渡。指挥官是源渡碇。

Shinji didn't know what to think. He was VERY HAPPY that there was someone he MIGHT be familiar with in this world, but he was also dreadful – what if Gendo Ikari in this world also had a son called Shinji? That would be totally fucked up. "Umm…does the Commander have any child?"
真嗣不知道该怎么想。他非常高兴在这个世界上可能有他熟悉的人，但同时也很害怕——如果这个世界的源渡碇也有一个叫真嗣的儿子怎么办？那真是太糟糕了。“呃……指挥官有孩子吗？”

"He has a daughter, that's the only thing I'm cleared to tell you," Agent Hiro said, his facial expression never changed.
"他有一个女儿，这是我能告诉你的全部信息，"特工广说，他的表情始终没有变化。

Shinji sighed in relief. At least he didn't have to deal with another Shinji. He had just met Rei today – and now he was sure that Gendo's daughter must be her. Suddenly Shinji felt a surge of anger – before the fight with the fifth Angel, he saw Rei Ayanami talking to his father smiling, and his father smiled as well. And it was already more than everything he had ever given his actual son. Now in this world Rei was straightforward his daughter. How convenient. Shinji had never felt this lonely before – although he was alone for most of his life.
真嗣松了一口气。至少他不用面对另一个真嗣。他今天刚遇到绫波，现在他确信源渡的女儿一定是她。突然间，真嗣感到一阵愤怒——在与第五使徒战斗之前，他看到绫波丽笑着与他的父亲交谈，他的父亲也笑了。这已经超过了他实际儿子所得到的一切。现在在这个世界里，绫波直接就是他的女儿。多么方便。真嗣从未感到如此孤独——尽管他一生中大部分时间都是独自一人。

His mind drifted to the girl he met today on the beach. He barely knew her except her fiery personality and her name, as well as she was just like him – thrown in this world and lost nine months of memory. Somehow he just knew he could only get the answers from her.
他的思绪飘向了今天在海滩上遇见的那个女孩。他对她几乎一无所知，只知道她性格火辣，以及她的名字，还有她和自己一样——被抛入这个世界，失去了九个月的记忆。不知怎的，他直觉只有她能给出答案。

Twenty minutes later, he stood in front of the grey-ish door of Commander's office. Agent Hiro entered first and informed the Commander about his presence, with a "Come in." Shinji stepped inside with shaky legs, his eyes fixed on the floor.
二十分钟后，他站在指挥官办公室那扇灰蒙蒙的门前。特工广进入并告知指挥官他的到来，随着一声“进来。”真嗣颤抖着双腿走了进去，目光紧盯着地板。

"Look at me, kid." The cold and stern voice was too familiar to Shinji. He looked up, his fa-Commander Ikari was wearing orange glasses to hide his eyes, his hands clasped together, covering half of his face. Although Shinji couldn't see his eyes clearly, just the grim atmosphere was enough to make his knees wobble. "Do you know what's your purpose here?"
“看着我，孩子。”那冷酷而严厉的声音对真嗣来说太过熟悉。他抬起头，眼前的指挥官碇源堂戴着橙色眼镜遮住了眼睛，双手交握，遮住了半张脸。尽管真嗣看不清他的眼神，但仅仅是那阴郁的气氛就足以让他的膝盖发软。“你知道你来这里的目的是什么吗？”

"N-no, sir," Shinji gulped hard, dropping cold sweat.
“不、不知道，长官，”真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，冷汗直流。

"Hm." Gendo examined the boy in front of him. He seemed extremely oblivious, but at the same time, he looked an awful lot like Yui and Rei. His appearance matched the descriptions in the Dead Sea Scrolls almost perfectly, but the descriptions were vague anyway. He was also disappointed; he expected The Two would be someone special, not some shy and wimpy teenager. "What do you remember, kid?"
嗯。" 源堂审视着面前的少年。他看起来非常迟钝，但同时，他的长相与唯和绫波极为相似。他的外貌与死海文书中的描述几乎完全吻合，尽管那些描述本身就很模糊。他也感到失望；他本以为“二者”会是某个特别的人，而不是一个害羞懦弱的青少年。"孩子，你记得什么？

"I-I-I don't know," Shinji stuttered, "I just woke up on a beach, I don't remember anything…"
我...我...我不知道，" 真嗣结巴地说，"我刚在海滩上醒来，什么都不记得了……

His statement captured Gendo's attention. 'Doesn't remember anything…how curious. Sounds just like someone who fell from the sky, doesn't it? And he was with that girl as well…might as well get him settled first, and let Naoko Akagi do some tests.' Having made his decision, Gendo Ikari said, "Good. You're invited here as an employee of Gehirn."
他的话引起了源堂的注意。'什么都不记得了……真有趣。听起来就像是从天上掉下来的人，不是吗？而且他还和那个女孩在一起……还是先让他安顿下来，让赤木直子做些测试吧。' 做出决定后，源堂说："好。你被邀请作为 Gehirn 的员工留在这里。"

"Wha-what?" Shinji yelped, "what do you want me to do here?" 'AND I THOUGHT I GOT RID OF NERV! OR GEHIRN! Whatever this is!'
"什...什么？" 真嗣惊叫道，"你想要我在这里做什么？" '而且我还以为我摆脱了 NERV！或者是 Gehirn！不管这是什么！'

"Human-computer neural link interactions," Gendo spoke coldly.
"人机神经链接交互，" 源渡冷冷地说道。

"What is that? Why me?"
那是什么？为什么是我？

"Because only you can do it."
因为只有你能做到。

It gave Shinji a strange feeling of déjà vu. "I-I can't do that! I don't even know what that is!"
这给了真嗣一种奇怪的似曾相识感。"我-我做不到！我甚至不知道那是什么！"

"If you're not gonna do it, then leave!" Gendo added some force into his tone, "we do not need useless kids!" He just said that, but in reality, he wasn't really going to just let Shinji go. He was likely to be one of The Two – he's too valuable to lose.
"如果你不打算做，那就离开！" 源渡加重了语气，"我们不需要没用的孩子！" 他虽然这么说，但实际上并不打算真的让真嗣走。真嗣很可能是那两位之一——他太宝贵了，不能失去。

Shinji wanted to argue, but reality stopped him. This world was alien to him – he didn't even have a place to live here. And the person in front of him, although looked, sounded, and acted like his father, but was not. So he didn't really have any reason to reject the offer. In fact, he should be thankful – people don't just offer any random kids important jobs. And it wasn't piloting an EVA, much to his relief.
真嗣本想争辩，但现实阻止了他。这个世界对他来说太陌生了——他甚至没有地方可以住。而眼前这个人，尽管看起来、听起来、行为上都像他的父亲，但并不是。所以他并没有真正拒绝的理由。事实上，他应该感到庆幸——人们不会随便给任何孩子提供重要的工作。而且，这并不是驾驶 EVA，让他松了一口气。

"Okay, I'll do it." Shinji said.
"好吧，我做。" 真嗣说。

"Good." Gendo pulled out a contract from under his desk, "read and sign this."
很好。" 源渡从桌子底下拿出一份合同，"读一读，然后签字。

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

After Shinji Shikinami had signed the contract, Gendo Ikari arranged a living quarter inside the GeoFront to him. He then asked his subordinates to do some research on this kid. Not surprisingly, his face wasn't registered in the national security database, just like the girl.
在碇真嗣签下合同后，碇源堂为他安排了位于 GeoFront 内的住所。随后，他指示下属对这个孩子进行调查。不出所料，他的面孔并未在国家安全数据库中登记，正如那个女孩一样。

Gendo kept his unwavering facial expression as twelve monoliths appeared around him.
当十二块巨碑出现在周围时，碇源堂保持着他那坚定不移的表情。

"Gendo, are you sure that boy is the other one of The Two?" SEELE 01 was the first to speak as always, "the Dead Sea Scrolls implies only The Two could help to initiate Second Impact."
碇，你确定那个男孩是‘两人’中的另一个吗？" SEELE 01 一如既往地率先开口，"死海文书暗示只有‘两人’能帮助引发第二次冲击。

"I suppose you mean The Two are the only ones who have a high chance of success with the contact experiment with Adam," Gendo Ikari corrected, "The Two are special. Somehow they are naturally akin to Adam and Lilith, and that's what ensures success."
我猜你指的是 The Two 是唯一有高成功率与亚当进行接触实验的人，" 源堂元纠正道，"The Two 很特殊。不知何故，他们天生与亚当和莉莉丝相似，这就是确保成功的关键。

"Is that so?" SEELE 03 spoke, "do they possess supernatural powers? Are they Gods?"
是这样吗？" SEELE 03 说道，"他们拥有超自然力量吗？他们是神吗？

"We still lack necessary information," Gendo raised his eyebrow but unseen by SEELE members, "we will know more about them once Dr. Akagi completes her tests."
我们仍然缺乏必要的信息，" 源堂挑了挑眉，但 SEELE 成员并未察觉，"等赤木博士完成她的测试后，我们会对他们有更多了解。

"Do you trust that woman? Yui doesn't seem to like her," SEELE 02 asked.
"你信任那个女人吗？唯似乎不太喜欢她，" SEELE 02 问道。

"Naoko is more than suitable for her job," Gendo replied with a hint of annoyance, "If she fails I will simply replace her. Additionally, the boy and the girl we found have the same surname, but they seem strange to each other. That can't be a coincidence."
直子完全胜任她的工作，" 源渡带着一丝不悦回答道，"如果她失败了，我会直接替换她。另外，我们找到的那个男孩和女孩姓氏相同，但他们彼此间似乎很陌生。这绝非巧合。

"Good job, Gendo," SEELE 01 said, "Now we have The Two under our control. Keep them safe from disturbances; our scenario can finally move forward."
干得好，源渡，" SEELE 01 说道，"现在我们控制了那两人。确保他们远离干扰；我们的计划终于可以推进了。

The monoliths disappeared, leaving Gendo Ikari alone in the room. 'Yui, our life's work shall finally be realized,' He smirked, 'humans will possess the power of Gods.'
石碑消失了，留下源渡一人独处室内。'唯，我们毕生的努力即将实现，' 他嘴角上扬，'人类将掌握神的力量。'

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Rei Ikari kept thinking about Shinji Shikinami she just met today. There was an unspoken familiarity about the boy. He looked a lot like her and her mom, which was disturbing. Any stranger would say they were a family at first glance. And he knew her codename, which disturbs her even more. No one outside of Project E should know that.
绫波丽一直在思考今天刚遇到的碇真嗣。那个男孩有一种难以言喻的熟悉感。他看起来和她以及她的母亲非常相似，这让人感到不安。任何陌生人第一眼都会认为他们是一家人。而且他还知道她的代号，这让她更加不安。除了 E 计划之外，不应该有人知道这个。

She was immersed in her thoughts as she approached her home. Sliding her keycard across the scanner, she opened the door and entered the room. "Tadaima." She announced.
她沉浸在思绪中，走到了家门口。她将门卡滑过扫描器，打开了门，走进房间。“我回来了。”她宣布道。

"Welcome home!" Yui Ikari's voice came from the kitchen, "oh, is papa working late again?"
欢迎回家！" 绫波唯的声音从厨房传来，"哦，爸爸又加班了吗？

"yeah, and he said we're not waiting for him for dinner," Rei answered with a dejected tone, "he's always so busy."
是的，他说我们不用等他吃晚饭了，" 绫波回答时语气有些沮丧，"他总是那么忙。

"Now, daughter, we all know his job is important…" Yui walked from the kitchen to Rei, and gave her a warm hug, "feeling better, sweetie?"
现在，女儿，我们都知道他的工作很重要……" Yui 从厨房走到 Rei 身边，给了她一个温暖的拥抱，"感觉好点了吗，亲爱的？

Rei smiled a warm smile, "Much better, mom." She broke the hug after a few seconds and walked to her room. She changed to a more comfortable attire and waited for dinner. She and her mom ate the dinner in comfortable silence.
Rei 露出了温暖的微笑，"好多了，妈妈。" 几秒钟后，她松开拥抱，走向自己的房间。她换上了更舒适的服装，等待晚餐。她和妈妈在舒适的沉默中享用了晚餐。

After shower Rei went straight to bed. A whole day of tiredness quickly overtook her, and she slipped into dream.
洗完澡后，Rei 直接上床睡觉。一整天的疲惫迅速袭来，她很快就进入了梦乡。

In the dream, Rei felt something strange. She found herself floating in total brightness, and it felt real. She had never had dreams like this before.
在梦中，Rei 感觉到了一些奇怪的东西。她发现自己漂浮在一片明亮之中，感觉非常真实。她以前从未做过这样的梦。

"Hello? Anyone out there?" She shouted into the brightness.
"你好？有人在那儿吗？" 她朝着光明处喊道。

Her voice acted like a switch as a cloaked figure appeared in front of her. "Hello, Rei Ayanami."
她的声音如同开关一般，一个披着斗篷的身影出现在她面前。"你好，绫波丽。"

"Who are you?" Rei asked, surprised at the mention of her codename.
"你是谁？" 绫波惊讶于对方提及她的代号。

"I'm a guide," the figure said, "and I need your help."
我是向导，" 那身影说，"我需要你的帮助。

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

AN: And that was Chapter 1 of You can (not) redo. The setting of the world is a world in 2016 without the Second Impact in 2000, and apparently SEELE still wanted to initiate their scenario to artificially evolve humans into Gods. Shinji and Asuka weren't supposed to exist in this world – they were left behind by the God Shinji and Asuka from NGE: Sincerely Yours. Rei was Gendo and Yui's legitimate daughter in this reconstructed world, and she was treated like a normal girl, so her personality would be OOC.
AN: 那是《你不能重来》的第一章。这个世界的背景设定在 2016 年，没有 2000 年的第二次冲击，显然 SEELE 仍然想要启动他们的计划，将人类人工进化为神。在这个世界中，真嗣和明日香本不应存在——他们被来自《真心为你》的神级真嗣和明日香遗留下来。在这个重构的世界里，零是元度和唯的合法女儿，她被当作普通女孩对待，因此她的性格会显得不符合原作。

AND THE DRAMA AND PARODIES START THE NEXT CHAPTER!
下一章开始戏剧和恶搞！

As for the changes in Dead Sea Scrolls – it was a supernatural existence on earth, so it would change accordingly with the world.
至于死海文书的变化——它是一种地球上的超自然存在，因此会随着世界的变化而相应改变。

As for Asuka's talent in piloting the EVA – we all know it's just her wishful thinking. :/
至于明日香驾驶 EVA 的才能——我们都知道那只是她的一厢情愿。:/

Why use the Commander instead of something like CEO since Gehirn wasn't a military organization? Because it's more convenient this way. :/
为什么使用“指挥官”而不是像“首席执行官”这样的称呼，毕竟 GEHIRN 并非军事组织？因为这样更方便。:/

### Chapter 2: The Dreams and The Shikinamis
梦境与四叶草

"Who are you?" Rei asked, surprised at the mention of her codename.
"你是谁？" 绫波惊讶于对方提及她的代号。

"I'm a guide," the figure said, "and I need your help."
我是向导，" 那身影说，"我需要你的帮助。

"A guide?" Rei narrowed her eyes at the cloaked figure, her expression incredulous, "If you're a guide then how do you need my help? It should be you helping me, don't you think?"
向导？" 零眯起眼睛看着那个披着斗篷的身影，表情充满怀疑，"如果你是向导，那你为什么需要我的帮助？应该是你帮助我才对，你不觉得吗？

The guide choked, "Listen wonderg-Rei, I AM a guide, let me rephrase that…I will guide you to help me-not exactly me me, but close enough."
向导哽咽道："听着，奇迹少女-零，我确实是个向导，让我重新表述一下……我会引导你来帮助我——不是完全的我，但也差不多了。"

"Why should I care? This is in my dream. You're not even real." Rei said and turned around, trying to ignore the so-called guide and find a way out of this strange place.
"我为什么要关心这个？这是在我的梦里。你甚至都不是真的。" 零说着转过身，试图忽略那个所谓的向导，寻找从这个奇怪地方出去的方法。

The guide grumbled irately, "Rei Ayanami, the First Child! Spawn of Lilith! Look at me!"
向导不满地嘟囔着：“绫波丽，第一适格者！莉莉丝的后裔！看着我！”

Rei blinked. No one except her father, her mother, Dr. Naoko Akagi, and Professor Fuyutsuki should know that. She was told to be the key to human evolution – she was artificially produced from Lilith below GeoFront and Yui's DNA. She had a purpose. Although her parents treated her like any other normal girl, she knew what her ultimate destiny was.
绫波丽眨了眨眼。除了她的父亲、母亲、赤木直子博士和冬月教授，应该没有人知道这一点。她被告知是人类进化的关键——她是根据地下都市莉莉丝和碇唯的 DNA 人工制造的。她有一个使命。尽管她的父母像对待普通女孩一样对待她，但她知道自己最终的命运是什么。

The contact experiment with Adam.
与亚当的接触实验。

The Dead Sea Scrolls stated that only Adam and Lilith's kin could succeed in the contact experiment, and The Two was supposed to be the only natural candidate. Apparently SEELE got impatient and tried to artificially create their own The Two – Rei Ikari.
死海文书指出，只有亚当和莉莉丝的后代才能成功进行接触实验，而“二者”本应是唯一的自然候选人。显然，SEELE 变得不耐烦，试图人工创造他们自己的“二者”——碇真嗣。

She shook it off, thinking it was just a conversation with her subconscious.
她摇了摇头，以为这只是与自己潜意识的对话。

"No I'm not!" The guide raised her -Rei could clearly recognize the voice was a girl's- volume, "I know all this because I am-" the guide paused for a second, seemingly choosing her next words cautiously, "I am Lilith! I need to guide you to complete your purpose! Yeah, that's it."
不，我不是！" 向导提高了声音——Rei 能清楚地听出那是一个女孩的声音——"我知道这一切是因为我就是——"向导停顿了一下，似乎在谨慎地选择接下来的话，"我就是莉莉丝！我需要引导你完成你的使命！对，就是这样。

Rei blinked. She turned to look at the cloaked figure, "Is that so? Then I am more than willing to listen to your guidance." Now it made sense to Rei. It was possible for Lilith – a God-like creature – to contact her in some weird way. She was also made from Lilith, after all. And it was comprehensible that Lilith wanted to guide her to help complete the contact experiment.
Rei 眨了眨眼。她转头看向那个披着斗篷的身影，"是这样吗？那么我非常愿意听取你的指引。" 现在 Rei 明白了。莉莉丝——一个神一般的存在——以某种奇怪的方式与她联系是有可能的。毕竟，她也是由莉莉丝创造的。而且，莉莉丝想要引导她帮助完成接触实验也是合情合理的。

'Lilith' sighed in relief, "Wunderbar. Now have you met a boy with brown hair and cobalt eyes, and a girl with red hair and blue eyes?"
'莉莉丝'松了口气，"太好了。那么，你有没有遇到一个棕色头发、钴蓝色眼睛的男孩，和一个红头发、蓝眼睛的女孩？"

"Yes, I have met the boy and heard about the girl, but haven't met her in person yet," Rei answered matter-of-factly.
"是的，我见过那个男孩，也听说过那个女孩，但还没有亲自见过她，" Rei 实事求是地回答道。

"Good. I need you to help them get together – I mean, you know what I mean, right? They are VERY important to me," 'Lilith' asked, her hands on her hips.
"很好。我需要你帮助他们走到一起——我的意思是，你知道我的意思，对吧？他们对我来说非常重要，" 'Lilith' 问道，双手叉腰。

"I suppose you mean I need to help them get romantically involved," Rei interpreted.
"我想你的意思是，我需要帮助他们建立恋爱关系，" Rei 解读道。

"Exactly," 'Lilith' sounded smiling, "time is almost up. I'll see you later! Also, don't tell any part of our conversation to anyone! Or everything, including your purpose, will be totally screwed!"
正是如此，" 'Lilith' 听起来面带微笑，"时间快到了。我们稍后再见！还有，不要向任何人透露我们对话的任何内容！否则，包括你的目的在内，一切都将彻底搞砸！

Although it was a weird request, Rei still accepted it. "Yes, Lilith. I shall keep the secret."
尽管这是个奇怪的请求，但绫还是接受了。“好的，莉莉丝，我会保守秘密的。”

"Wunderbar. I'll keep your words." 'Lilith' faded.
“太棒了。我会记住你的话。”'莉莉丝'逐渐消失。

Rei opened her eyes slowly at exactly 6:45 a.m. 'What a weird dream,' she thought, 'but I'll keep my words. It's God herself asking me for help; how could I refuse?'
绫在早上 6 点 45 分缓缓睁开眼睛。'真是个奇怪的梦，'她想，'但我还是会遵守诺言。这可是上帝亲自向我求助，我怎能拒绝呢？'

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Shinji was lying on his bed brooding, unable to sleep. He went over the day's incidents over and over again. He was happy that at least Rei seemed to act like a normal girl, and he was employed into some secret program, so that he wouldn't need to worry about his accommodations anymore. He still needed to buy new clothes, though. That he could arrange tomorrow. He got one-third of his monthly payment – by the way, it's a LOT – as advance, and legal identity. He was content for now.
真嗣躺在床上沉思，难以入睡。他一遍遍地回想当天的种种事件。至少绫表现得像个普通女孩，这让他感到欣慰，而且他被招募进了一个秘密项目，从此不必再担心住宿问题。不过，他还需要买新衣服。这个可以安排在明天。他提前拿到了月薪的三分之一——顺便说一下，那可是一大笔钱——还有合法身份。他现在感到满足。

He still missed Toji, Kensuke, and Misato, though. He hoped he could still see them in this world, maybe connect with them like what he did in the world he knew.
他仍然想念着东治、剑介和美里。他希望在这个世界里还能见到他们，或许能像他在熟悉的世界那样与他们联系。

And about Asuka – he was curious about, attracted to, and afraid of her simultaneously. He hoped he could see her again sometime. She even said, 'this ain't over'! At that time he was terrified, but now he started to…hoping she would do what she said. 'Am I a masochist or something?' He mocked himself.
至于明日香——他对她既好奇又吸引，同时又感到害怕。他希望有一天能再次见到她。她甚至说过，“这事还没完！”那时他感到恐惧，但现在他开始……希望她会履行她的话。“我是不是有点受虐倾向？”他自嘲道。

Tossing and turning for almost an hour, the tiredness finally overcame and he drifted to sleep.
辗转反侧近一个小时后，疲惫终于战胜了他，使他沉入梦乡。

"Hello, Shinji Ikari," a cloaked figure appeared in front of him.
“你好，碇真嗣，”一个披着斗篷的身影出现在他面前。

"Hmmm? How do you know my real name?" Shinji asked, surprised.
"嗯？你怎么知道我的真名？" 真嗣惊讶地问道。

The figure chuckled, "I'm a prophesier, I know everything."
那身影轻笑道："我是个预言家，我无所不知。"

"Like?" 比如？

"You WERE the Third Child, pilot of Evangelion Unit 01." The prophesier said nonchalantly.
"你曾是第三适格者，驾驶着 EVA 初号机。" 预言家漫不经心地说道。

"Well…if you know that, do you know what happened to the world? Why nobody recognizes me?"
那么…如果你知道那件事，你知道世界发生了什么吗？为什么没有人认出我？

"It was part of my mistake… I'm sorry."
那是我犯的错的一部分…对不起。

"Wha-what? YOUR mistake?"
什-什么？你的错？

"I didn't know this could happen…or maybe I wouldn't have done this. I'm very, very sorry."
我不知道会发生这种事…或许我当初就不会这么做。我非常、非常抱歉。

"You being sorry doesn't help a lot, does it?" Shinji snarled, staring at the prophesier angrily.
"你道歉也没多大用处，不是吗？" 真嗣咆哮着，愤怒地盯着预言者。

"I'm here to offer you my help," the prophesier said in an apologetic tone, "you are given a special mission here."
我来这里是为了向你提供帮助，" 预言者用歉意的语气说道，"你在这里被赋予了一项特殊的使命。

"What? As if being an EVA pilot wasn't special enough…"
什么？好像成为 EVA 驾驶员还不够特别似的……

"I need your help to prevent the Second Impact."
我需要你的帮助来阻止第二次冲击。

"Huh? Second…I guess it didn't happen here, apparently…but how am I gonna prevent a meteor from hitting the earth? And if you're really a prophesier, isn't YOUR job to help ME?"
啊？第二次冲击……我猜这里并没有发生，显然……但我怎么阻止陨石撞击地球呢？而且如果你真的是预言者，不是应该你来帮我吗？

"I'm…I can't physically interfere with this world…and there are very few people I can connect with like this…in fact, there are only three people in this world we can connect with."
我……我无法在这个世界进行物理干预……而且我能这样联系的人非常少……事实上，在这个世界上我们只能联系到三个人。

"We?"

"Ah, yes, she's connecting with the other one right now…but that's not important. So Second Impact. It wasn't a meteor. A bunch of scientists did some kind of experiment in Antarctica with the First Angel, Adam, and the experiment caused Adam to explode, leading to Second Impact. Meteor hitting earth was just some shit Governments fed to their people."
啊，是的，她现在正与另一个人连接……但这不重要。所以第二次冲击。它不是陨石造成的。一群科学家在南极洲与第一使徒亚当进行了某种实验，实验导致亚当爆炸，引发了第二次冲击。陨石撞击地球只是各国政府向民众散布的谎言。

"Hmmm…but…I don't know how I'm gonna prevent that, either."
嗯……但是……我也不知道我该如何阻止那件事。

"Don't worry. I'll guide you. First step – the girl who woke up on the beach with you."
别担心，我会引导你。第一步——那个和你一起在海滩上醒来的女孩。

Shinji gulped, "What about her?"
真嗣咽了口口水，"她怎么了？"

"…how am I gonna say this…try to ask her out? Date her? Make her yours? Give yourself to her? Nah…those are too much to ask for now," Shinji sighed in relief as he heard those last words, "how about this…be there for her. Don't run away."
…这要怎么说呢…试着约她出去？和她约会？让她属于你？把自己交给她？不…这些现在问都太过了，"真嗣听到最后那句话，松了口气，"这样吧…陪在她身边。不要逃避。

"Well…as long as she doesn't push me away…I think I can do that," Shinji replied with uncertainty.
"嗯…只要她不推开我…我想我能做到，"真嗣不确定地回答。

The prophesier was obviously disappointed, "I'm serious, Don't. Leave. Her."
预言家显然很失望，“我是认真的，不要。离开。她。”

"Hey! It's not like I had a choice!" Shinji protested, "she hates my guts! She tried to kill me! You're asking me to do the Mission Impossible!"
嘿！我又不是有选择！" 真嗣抗议道，"她恨透了我！她曾试图杀我！你这是让我去完成不可能的任务！

"She doesn't mean what she says…for most of the time," the prophesier reassured.
"她并非总是言出必行…大多数时候是这样，" 预言家安慰道。

"Well, if you can do this to me, why don't you go and connect to her and ask her the same thing?"
既然你能这样对我，为何不自己去和她沟通，问她同样的问题呢？

"She's…difficult to reach," the prophesier said, "I will, later, but…not like this."
她……很难联系上，"预言者说，"我晚些时候会联系她，但……不是这样。

"Tch, I thought you're some kind of God, I thought you know everything!"
啧，我还以为你是某种神呢，以为你无所不知！

"Trust me, Shinji," the prophesier said, "I know her better than anyone. You are the only one who can understand her in this world, except me that is."
相信我，真嗣，"预言者说，"我比任何人都了解她。在这个世界上，除了我，只有你能理解她。

Shinji's dream was interrupted by the sound of the alarm. Within two seconds he slammed her palm on the clock, effectively shutting it down. Rubbing his sleepy eyes, he tried to get up from bed, but failed at the initial attempt. He decided to lay there for a while – there weren't school anymore, anyway.
真嗣的梦被闹钟声打断。两秒内，他猛地一掌拍在闹钟上，成功将其关闭。揉着惺忪的睡眼，他试图从床上爬起来，但初次尝试失败了。他决定再躺一会儿——反正已经没有学校了。

Then the memory of the dream last night rushed back to him.
随后，昨晚的梦境记忆突然涌回他的脑海。

'Crap…' '糟糕…'

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Asuka had a very bizarre dream last night.
明日香昨晚做了一个非常奇怪的梦。

"Third Child, you're coming with me!"
第三适格者，你跟我来！

"Evangelion Unit 02, move out!"
福音战士二号机，出动！

"Third Child, have you played hopscotch?"
第三适格者，你玩过跳房子吗？

"Unit 02 coming in for landing!"
二号机即将着陆！

In retrospect, she was sure these were pieces of her lost memories. She could recognize the surroundings as a fleet – which indicated it happened during her ride on Over the Rainbow. She was happy that at least she experienced piloting an EVA; however, she was curious about this 'Third Child'. She couldn't gather any details of him – she knew Third Child was a boy since Kaji had told her – but she was curious about why he was also in her EVA. She probably did it to show off her piloting skills.
回望过去，她确信这些都是她遗失记忆的碎片。她能认出周围的环境是一支舰队——这意味着这一切发生在她乘坐“彩虹之上”的时候。她很高兴至少体验过驾驶 EVA；然而，她对这位“第三适格者”感到好奇。她无法收集到关于他的任何细节——她知道第三适格者是个男孩，因为加持曾告诉过她——但她好奇为什么他也在她的 EVA 里。她可能这么做是为了炫耀她的驾驶技术。

Asuka awoke to the light pouring through her window, and the smell of half–burned food coming from the kitchen. "What the hell?" She muttered. Asuka grabbed a quick change of clothes and went out to see where the awful smell was coming from. She saw Misato in the kitchen near the microwave. "Misato… what is that?" Asuka asked.
明日香醒来时，阳光透过窗户洒了进来，厨房里传来半焦食物的气味。"搞什么鬼？"她嘟囔着。明日香迅速换了衣服，走出去查看那难闻的气味来源。她看到美里在厨房里，靠近微波炉。"美里……那是什么？"明日香问道。

"It's breakfast, silly!" Misato replied, showing her two plates of what looked like lumpy curry over rice.
"这是早餐啦，傻瓜！"美里回答道，向她展示了两盘看起来像是糊状咖喱盖饭的东西。

"Bre… breakfast?" Asuka asked, grimacing, "Is that edible? Are you trying to poison me?"
早……早餐？"明日香皱着眉头问，"那能吃吗？你是想毒死我吗？

"Are you insulting my cooking?" Misato asked, fake frowning, and leaned over to stare at Asuka.
"你在贬低我的厨艺吗？"美里假装皱眉，凑近盯着明日香问。

"I'm just stating the facts!" Asuka retorted, "Why are we having all this lunch for breakfast exactly?"
我只是在陈述事实！" 明日香反驳道，"为什么我们早餐要吃这么多午餐呢？

"Cause its already 11 a.m." Misato said as she stirred her food.
"因为现在已经 11 点了。" 美里边搅拌食物边说。

"Why didn't you wake me up?!" Asuka said surprised, her mouth agape.
"你为什么不叫醒我？！" 明日香惊讶地说，嘴巴张得大大的。

"You were snoring so much, I figured I should let you sleep. Now, come on and eat before it gets all cold!" Misato said, setting the two plates down and plopping into a chair. "Hey could you get me a can from the fridge before you sit down?"
你打呼噜太厉害了，我想你应该多睡会儿。快来吃吧，不然就凉了！" 美里说着，放下两盘食物，一屁股坐进椅子里。"嘿，坐下前能帮我从冰箱拿罐饮料吗？

"Get it yourself, you slacker!" Asuka spatted but soon changed her idea, "How about this - I'll get you one if you let me have one as well."
自己去拿，你这个懒虫！" 明日香斥责道，但很快改变了主意，"这样吧——我帮你拿一个，如果你也让我拿一个的话。

"NO ABSOLUTELY NOT!" Misato shouted, standing up from the table and walked to the fridge, "you brat…"
绝对不行！" 美里大声喊道，从桌边站起来走向冰箱，"你这小鬼……

She opened it to reveal nothing but beer and snacks. Asuka saw it all and grimaced, 'It's amazing she's so thin if she eats all this junk!' She thought.
她打开冰箱，里面只有啤酒和零食。明日香看到这一切，皱起了眉头，'她要是吃这么多垃圾食品还能这么瘦，真是不可思议！' 她心想。

"Hey, Misato, what's in this fridge over there?" Asuka noticed another fridge beside the one with all beers in it, suddenly getting curious.
"嘿，美里，那边那个冰箱里有什么？" 明日香注意到旁边还有一个冰箱，里面不是装满啤酒的那个，突然好奇起来。

"Oh, that one doesn't have food in it, just leave him alone, he might be sleeping." Misato replied nonchalantly, grabbing a beer.
"哦，那个里面没有食物，别管他了，他可能在睡觉。" 碇真嗣漫不经心地回答，顺手拿起一罐啤酒。

"Leave who alone…" Asuka wondered as the fridge popped open, revealing a short penguin. He had a towel in one flipper and a bowl of bath supplies in the other. He waddled off to the bathroom-
"别管谁……" 明日香疑惑地看着冰箱门打开，里面露出一只矮小的企鹅。它一只鳍里夹着毛巾，另一只鳍里端着一盆洗浴用品，摇摇摆摆地朝浴室走去。

A wave of memories rushed back to her.
一连串的记忆涌上心头。

Asuka entered the bathroom, took off her clothes, and laid in the bathtub filled with hot water. She felt so comfortable just lying there. She wanted to get some Shampoo and wash her hair, so she just reached out her hand to the position she thought the shampoo should be, just to grab on something very hairy and soft.
明日香走进浴室，脱掉衣服，躺进装满热水的浴缸里。她感到非常舒适，只想躺在那里。她想拿洗发水洗头，于是伸手去拿她认为洗发水应该在的位置，却抓到了一团毛茸茸、软绵绵的东西。

"WARK!" peck. "WARK!" 啄了一下。

"OUCH!" Asuka cried, immediately withdrew her arm, and found a red mark on her hand. "Stupid Penguin!" Asuka hissed in German and stood up. She had to find the shampoo after all. Just as she was about to step out of the bathtub, she heard the door of the bathroom slide open, someone's concerned voice came after-
"哎呀！" 明日香叫了一声，立刻缩回手臂，发现手上有一块红印。"笨蛋企鹅！" 明日香用德语低声咒骂，站起身来。她终究还是得去找洗发水。正当她准备跨出浴缸时，听到浴室门被滑开，随后传来某人关切的声音——

Asuka blushed furiously as she remembered what happened next. The boy saw it all – although she didn't remember who he was.
明日香想起接下来发生的事，脸颊涨得通红。那个男孩目睹了一切——尽管她记不清他是谁。

Now Asuka was completely baffled. Apparently she WAS living here with some boy – and this very same penguin. She frowned at the ridiculous flashback, but she knew it was her memory.
现在明日香彻底困惑了。显然她确实和某个男孩——还有这只企鹅——住在一起。她对这段荒谬的回忆皱眉，但知道这是她的记忆。

"His name is Pen–Pen. He's cute right?" Misato explained as she saw Asuka's confused face, her mouth full of food.
"他的名字叫 Pen–Pen，很可爱对吧？" 看到明日香困惑的表情，嘴里塞满食物的葛城美里解释道。

"I guess, but stupid anyway." Asuka shook her head.
"我觉得还行，但还是很蠢。" 明日香摇了摇头。

"He's a new breed of hot springs penguin, I've had him for a few years." Misato explained. "He's pretty friendly, and will eat pretty much anything at all."
他是一种新品种的温泉企鹅，我养了他几年了。" 葛城美里解释说，"他非常友好，几乎什么都吃。

As Asuka sat down, Misato cracked one open and chugged it down whole. "WHOOO YEAH! That's some good stuff! You know life doesn't get any better than this!" Misato looked over at Asuka. "Are you not hungry? You haven't eaten at all since yesterday, right? Don't worry, just cause it's instant, doesn't mean it's not good."
当明日香坐下时，葛城美里打开一瓶一饮而尽。"呼！太棒了！你知道吗，生活没有比这更美好的了！" 葛城美里看向明日香，"你不饿吗？你从昨天开始就没吃过东西，对吧？别担心，虽然是速食，但味道还是不错的。"

"I'm not eating any of these biochemical weapons! This is child abuse!" Asuka cried, still bewildered about Misato's tolerance in food.
"我绝不吃这些生化武器！这是虐待儿童！" 明日香哭喊道，仍然对葛城美里对食物的容忍度感到困惑。

"Are you being finicky?!" Misato shouted, leaning over the table threateningly. "You know it's impolite to refuse food just because it looks bad!"
你是在挑食吗？！" 葛城美里吼道，威胁性地俯身在桌子上。"你知道因为食物看起来不好就拒绝是不礼貌的！

"Arghhh! Fine, but next time I'll be the one cooking, or we'll order takeouts!"
啊！好吧，但下次我来做饭，或者我们叫外卖！

"Awww, isn't that sweet." Misato said happily, "Eating with someone else sure beats sitting alone, right?"
哎呀，真甜蜜。" 葛城美里开心地说，"和别人一起吃饭肯定比独自坐着好，对吧？

"Whatever…" Asuka said as Misato sat back down, and she took a bite of the food in front of her. 'Holy shit… this is awful!' Asuka thought, 'It's amazing she hasn't burned something down or died from eating this…But I don't want to irate Misato anymore, so I'll eat this… bleh!' The two ate in silence until they had both finished all the so–called food in front of them. Misato had chugged four beers since breakfast started, and was now feeling quite good.
"不管了……" 明日香说着，见美里重新坐下，便咬了一口面前的食物。'天哪……这太难吃了！' 明日香心想，'真不知道她是怎么没把房子烧了或者吃这东西吃死的……但我不想再惹美里生气了，还是吃吧……呸！' 两人默默地吃着，直到把所谓的食物都吃完了。美里从早餐开始已经灌了四瓶啤酒，现在感觉相当不错。

"Hmmm." Misato pinched her chin, "Well there's something else important, I guess we do have some chores to split up." Misato had a sly smile on her face. "And there's only one way to do that fairly…"
嗯……" 美里捏着下巴，"还有件重要的事，我们确实有些家务要分担。" 美里脸上露出一丝狡黠的笑容。"只有一种公平的方式来分配……

"How, exactly?" Asuka asked, not anticipating what might come next.
"怎么分？" 明日香问，没料到接下来会发生什么。

"Stick out your hand Asuka," Misato said. When Asuka did Misato started, "Rock… Paper… Scissors!" After several rounds of play, the chores had been split, with Asuka, thankfully being wholly in charge of cooking and cleaning, with a few sporadic chores, much to her dismay.
"伸出你的手，明日香。" 美里说。明日香照做后，美里开始，"石头……剪刀……布！" 经过几轮游戏，家务被分配好了，幸运的是，明日香负责了全部的烹饪和清洁工作，外加一些零星杂务，这让她颇为不快。

"Hey! This is not fair!" Asuka cried, "Why am I in charge of nearly everything while YOU are my guardian?!"
嘿！这不公平！" 明日香哭喊道，"为什么我几乎要负责所有事情，而你却是我的监护人？！

Misato ignored her outburst, "So, now that that's settled, why don't you go and buy some stuff for yourself?" Misato said as she grabbed another beer.
美里对她的爆发置之不理，"那么，既然事情已经解决了，你为什么不去给自己买点东西呢？" 美里说着，又拿起了一罐啤酒。

"Hmph!" Asuka huffed, "But then I guess I have to start cleaning in here first, seeing as it's my day for that…" 'she's as immature as the Misato I knew, can she actually handle taking care of a kid?'
"哼！" 明日香哼了一声，"但我想我得先开始打扫这里，毕竟今天轮到我了……" '她和我认识的美里一样幼稚，她真的能照顾好一个孩子吗？'

"So as my first official act as your guardian, and because you're still a kid and everything, I enrolled you in the local junior high school, how's that sound?" Misato asked, showing another sly grin.
"作为你监护人的第一个正式行为，因为你还是个孩子，我给你报名了当地的初中，你觉得怎么样？" 美里问道，露出了狡黠的笑容。

"Mein Gott!" Asuka exclaimed, "Why do I have to go to school, doesn't being a Top-Secret test subject exempt me from that?"
我的天哪！" 明日香惊呼道，"为什么我还得去上学，难道作为顶级机密实验对象不应该免除这个吗？

"Asuka your well–being is my top concern, and that includes your education." Misato explained, sounding sincere, "I would be remiss if I didn't make sure you went to school. Also, being a test subject doesn't exempt you from school, Rei goes."
明日香，你的福祉是我最关心的，这当然包括你的教育。" 美里解释道，语气诚恳，"如果我不确保你去上学，那就是我的失职。而且，作为实验对象并不免除你上学的义务，绫波也去。

"Great, a secret job with no perks." Asuka said sarcastically, 'How nice… I'll have to deal with a lot of kids…and perverts…'
"太好了，一个没有福利的秘密工作。" 明日香讽刺地说，'真不错……我还得应付一大群孩子……还有变态……'

"Stop whining so much, Asuka. It won't be that bad. Seeing as today is Saturday, you'll have the weekend off, and you start on Monday, the same date as your job starts!"
别那么多抱怨了，明日香。不会那么糟的。既然今天是周六，你周末可以休息，而且你周一才开始上学，正好和你的工作开始日期一样！

"Wonderful…" Asuka said sullenly as she grabbed a garbage bag and started throwing out some of the garbage. "Just wonderful…"
太棒了……" 明日香闷闷不乐地说着，抓起一个垃圾袋开始扔掉一些垃圾。"真是太棒了……

Shinji just had a terrible brunch. The cafeteria of GeoFront was never a pleasant place to have food. The things they offered were not much unlike plastic and rubber. Shinji couldn't really decide whether Misato's cooking was better or worse, but he was sure both of them could be classified as biochemical weapons. 'These things should be banned by Vatican Treaty,' Shinji thought helplessly.
真嗣刚刚经历了一次糟糕的早午餐。GeoFront 的食堂从来都不是一个愉快的用餐地点。那里提供的食物与塑料和橡胶无异。真嗣实在无法判断是美里做的饭更好还是更糟，但他确信两者都可以归类为生化武器。'这些东西应该被梵蒂冈条约禁止，' 真嗣无助地想。

Shinji had a lot of things to do today. He needed to buy some clothes, including underwear and nightshirts. He wanted to visit Misato's place, although he didn't know whether it existed or not. And…his SDAT…and Cello…
真嗣今天有很多事情要做。他需要买些衣服，包括内衣和睡衣。他想拜访美里的住处，尽管他不确定它是否真的存在。还有……他的 SDAT……和大提琴……

'That could wait,' he thought, 'seeing my salary I could get a brand new one the next month.' Although those two things were his only souvenirs for his mother, and he was VERY sentimental in losing them – he figured if GOD needed his help, he might as well accept his fate. He was used to be passive to everything around him, anyway.
'那可以等等，' 他想，'以我的薪水，下个月我就能买个新的。' 尽管那两样东西是他母亲唯一的纪念品，他非常舍不得失去它们——但他觉得如果上帝需要他的帮助，他或许应该接受自己的命运。无论如何，他早已习惯了周围一切的被动。

He was also told that he would meet his assigned guardian today. He was looking forward to meeting this guy. He didn't really have anyone who could be considered a parent to him – his Sensei was kind to him, but that's mainly because of the insane amount of money his father was paying him. He could only hope his new guardian could be somehow different; he wanted a person who could care him for him only, not for money or other incentives.
他还被告知今天会见到他的指定监护人。他很期待与这个人见面。他并没有真正意义上的父母——他的老师对他很好，但主要是因为他父亲支付了巨额费用。他只能希望他的新监护人能有所不同；他想要一个只因关心他而照顾他的人，而不是为了金钱或其他利益。

Shinji sat in the office silently, waiting for his guardian. About 5 minutes into waiting, he heard footsteps coming closer to the office and male voices talking. 'So I guess he's male,' Shinji thought, 'I don't know how I feel about it…'
真嗣静静地坐在办公室里，等待着他的监护人。大约等了 5 分钟后，他听到脚步声越来越近，还有男性的交谈声。'看来他是男性，'真嗣心想，'我不知道我对此有何感受……'

"…okay I'll take care of this kid." The voice stopped outside the door, and the handle turned. The door opened to reveal a hunky and handsome adult male with a ponytail behind his head, "Hello kiddo, are you Shinji Shikinami?"
……好吧，我会照顾这个孩子的。"声音在门外停下，门把手转动。门打开，出现了一个魁梧英俊的成年男性，脑后扎着马尾辫，"你好，小朋友，你是碇真嗣吗？

Shinji carefully examined the man in front of him. He felt familiar, but he was sure he had never met him before. "H-hello, sir, yes, I am Shinji Ik-Shikinami," he smiled a small smile.
真嗣仔细打量着面前的男人。他感觉很熟悉，但他确信自己从未见过这个人。"您好，先生，是的，我是碇真嗣，"他微微一笑。

"Nice to meet you, Shinji-kun. I will be your assigned guardian from now on. I'm Kaji Ryoji."
很高兴见到你，真嗣君。从现在起，我将担任你的指定监护人。我是加持良治。

The name triggered a flash of memories.
这个名字唤起了一连串的记忆。

"I've gotta say, Kaji-san," Kaji turned around to see Shinji approaching; he put down the hose, little drips of water still pouring from its mouth. "I never did take you for the gardening type."
我得说，加持先生，" 加持转过身，看到真嗣走过来；他放下水管，水管口还有小水滴不断滴落。"我真没想到你会喜欢园艺。

"Well, everyone needs a hobby." He shrugged, sprinkling one last batch of melons before cutting the pressure. "I appreciate you want to chat with me. I have to admit it does get a little bit lonely being out here all by myself sometimes."
嗯，每个人都需要一个爱好。" 他耸了耸肩，给最后一批西瓜洒完水后关掉了水压。"我很感激你想和我聊天。我得承认，有时候一个人在这里确实有点孤单。

Shinji blinked. 'What the hell was that?' He thought, 'Apparently I knew about him…But why did I forget about this? And what exactly happened?' He shook it off for another time to think about. "Nice to meet you too, Kaji-san!"
真嗣眨了眨眼。'这到底是什么情况？' 他心想，'显然我之前就知道他……但我为什么忘记了这件事？究竟发生了什么？' 他决定暂时不去想这些，转而说道："也很高兴见到你，加持先生！"

Kaji chuckled, "so I've heard you don't have any personal stuff…not even clothes to change. Gehirn could provide furniture…but I guess it's your job to pick up clothes for yourself, right?"
加持轻笑道："听说你没有任何个人物品……甚至连换洗的衣服都没有。Gehirn 可以提供家具……但我想挑选衣服得你自己来，对吧？"

"Yes, Kaji-san. I am about to go shopping today, actually." Shinji replied with a warm grin.
"是的，加持先生。我今天正打算去购物呢。" 真嗣带着温暖的笑容回答。

"Great. I guess we could go shopping together, what do you think? We need to get to know each other, right?"
太好了。我觉得我们可以一起去购物，你觉得呢？我们需要相互了解一下，对吧？

Shinji was more than happy to accept the offer, "I'd love to, Kaji-san!"
真嗣非常乐意接受这个提议，"我很愿意，卡吉先生！"

Kaji smiled, "Good, now let's not waste any time. Get in my car."
卡吉微笑着说，"好，那我们不要浪费时间了。上我的车吧。"

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Shinji had a highly enjoyable shopping trip with Kaji. He seemed lively and funny – and always eager to start conversations. They talked about a lot of stuff, Shinji's apparent lack of family, for one – and Kaji showed a great amount of concern and sympathy. Shinji was thrilled that he could get such an interesting guardian.
真嗣与卡吉的购物之旅非常愉快。卡吉显得活泼有趣，总是乐于开启话题。他们聊了很多，比如真嗣明显的家庭缺失，卡吉对此表现出了极大的关心和同情。真嗣很高兴能有一个如此有趣的监护人。

It wasn't saying Misato was not good – but she could be really childish sometimes, while Kaji seemed mature enough to properly take care of kids. Shinji knew Misato cared about him, but Kaji was just a more enjoyable company.
这并不是说美里不好，但她有时确实很孩子气，而卡吉似乎成熟到足以妥善照顾孩子。真嗣知道美里关心他，但卡吉的陪伴确实更加愉快。

One thing that happened today that wasn't pleasant to Shinji was Kaji told him he needed to go to school starting next Monday. He really didn't want to go to school anymore. 'How nice… more people that won't want to be my friend that will want to make fun of me…' He thought bitterly. His first day at work was also next Monday – after school. They needed to do some physicals on him at first. He simply accepted it as a necessary procedure.
今天发生了一件让真嗣感到不愉快的事情，那就是薰告诉他需要从下周一开始去上学。他真的不想再去学校了。'真好……又是一群不想和我做朋友，只想取笑我的人……' 他苦涩地想。他的第一天工作也是下周一——放学后。他们需要先对他进行一些体检。他只是把它当作必要的程序接受了。

Kaji moved into the same living quarters with him, much to his wish. Although Kaji mentioned something like 'We will soon find another place to live. We can't just live here. This place is too stagnant.' Shinji was more than happy to agree with it – he wanted to live above ground, not under. He wanted to enjoy the city without having to take a forty minutes train ride at first.
薰搬进了和他相同的住处，这正合他意。尽管薰提到过 '我们很快会找到另一个住处。我们不能一直住在这里。这个地方太沉闷了。' 真嗣对此非常赞同——他想要住在地面上，而不是地下。他想要一开始就能享受城市，而不必先坐四十分钟的火车。

After sorting out their stuff after the shopping trip, Kaji asked Shinji, "Hey, Shinji-kun. I'm gonna go out for a ride. Wanna come with me?"
在购物回来整理完东西后，薰问真嗣："嘿，真嗣君。我要出去兜风。你想一起来吗？"

"Of course, Kaji-san!" Shinji said enthusiastically despite his tiredness, "where we going?"
当然，薰先生！" 真嗣尽管疲惫，但还是热情地回答，"我们去哪儿？

Kaji showed a warm smile, "to meet an old friend."
加治露出温暖的笑容，“为了见一位老朋友。”

Shinji raised his eyebrows as he heard the words. 'old friend? Who could it be…'
听到这话，真嗣扬起了眉毛。'老朋友？会是谁呢……'

They got into Kaji's car in the parking lot; with a slam on the pedal, the car rushed forward and speeded towards the elevator. Kaji's driving reminded him of Misato's; somehow, Shinji felt they were related in some way.
他们在停车场上了加治的车；一脚油门下去，车子疾驰而出，直奔电梯而去。加治的驾驶让他想起了美里；不知怎的，真嗣觉得他们之间有些关联。

"Kaji-san… what's your old friends' name?" Shinji suddenly asked, breaking the silence as they stopped in front of a red light.
"加治先生……您那位老朋友叫什么名字？" 真嗣突然问道，他们在红灯前停下时打破了沉默。

Kaji chuckled, "Having interests in my personal life, huh, Shinji-kun? I guess I'll tell you anyway since you're gonna meet her as well…her name is Misato Katsuragi. We were…"
加治轻笑道：“对我私生活感兴趣了啊，真嗣君？既然你也要见她，我就告诉你吧……她叫葛城美里。我们曾是……”

Shinji paid zero attention to Kaji's later babblings. His mind was in a turmoil of thoughts. Misato. Kaji knew her. She knew Kaji. They WERE related.
真嗣对加治后来的喋喋不休充耳不闻。他的思绪一片混乱。美里。加治认识她。她也认识加治。他们确实有关系。

As the car approached its destination, Shinji could easily recognize the surroundings. They were indeed heading towards Misato's apartment, much to Shinji's excitement. Kaji parked his car in the parking lot with an elegant U-turn and shut off the engine. "Shinji-kun, we're here."
当车子接近目的地时，真嗣轻易地认出了周围的环境。他们确实正驶向美里的公寓，这让真嗣兴奋不已。加治在停车场优雅地做了一个 U 形转弯，熄灭了引擎。“真嗣君，我们到了。”

Shinji got off the car in excitement and nervousness. He knew it's highly probable that Misato wouldn't recognize him as well, but it didn't matter anymore. With the help of Kaji he was sure that he could still connect with Misato to some degree.
真嗣带着兴奋和紧张下了车。他知道美里很可能也认不出他，但这已经不重要了。有了加治的帮助，他确信自己仍能与美里建立起某种联系。

The apartment building looked no different than he remembered, the only thing that seemed off was there were more people – although still not much – living in the building. They took the elevator to the seventh floor and stopped in front of the very same door that Shinji knew, the door plate had 'Katsuragi' imprinted on it.
公寓楼看起来和他记忆中并无二致，唯一不同的是楼里的人多了一些——尽管仍然不多。他们乘电梯到达七楼，停在碇真嗣熟悉的那扇门前，门牌上刻着“葛城”二字。

Kaji pressed the doorbell.
加持按响了门铃。

Ding Dong 叮咚

"Coming!" a too-familiar voice sounded. Shinji's heart was pounding madly in his chest – wait. That wasn't Misato's voice.
"来了！"一个过于熟悉的声音响起。真嗣的心脏在胸腔中狂跳——等等，那不是美里小姐的声音。

The door hissed open, and a mumbling redhead emerged behind the door.
门嘶嘶作响地打开了，一个喃喃自语的红发女子出现在门后。

Shinji gulped, ready to run away, while the redhead's eyes widened in disbelief, but she soon composed herself, "Hello! What can I do for you?" She said as sweetly as possible, a total antagonism to the redhead Shinji knew.
真嗣咽了口唾沫，准备逃跑，而红发女子的眼睛惊讶地睁大了，但她很快恢复了镇定，“你好！有什么能帮到你的吗？”她尽可能甜美地说道，与真嗣所认识的红发女子截然相反。

Kaji smiled, "Hello, kiddo, you must be Katsuragi's charge," he greeted, "I'm Kaji Ryoji. Nice to meet you!"
加持微笑着说：“你好，小朋友，你一定是葛城的人吧，”他打招呼道，“我是加持良治。很高兴见到你！”

"Nice to meet you, too, Kaji-san!" Asuka smiled sweetly, eliciting a chill ran down Shinji's spine, "I'm Asuka! And yes, Misato's my guardian! Do you know her?"
“也很高兴见到你，加持先生！”明日香甜甜地笑了，让真嗣脊背发凉，“我是明日香！是的，美里是我的监护人！你认识她吗？”

"She's an old friend of mine," Kaji replied, "now if you excuse me-"
她是我的一位老朋友，" 加持回答道，"现在如果你不介意的话——

"Please come in, Kaji-san!" "Who is it, Asuka?" Misato's voice finally came to Shinji.
"请进，加持先生！" "是谁啊，明日香？" 美里终于对真嗣说道。

"It's Kaji!" Asuka said loudly.
"是加持！" 明日香大声说道。

"K-Kaji?" Misato hurriedly rolled off from the couch and came to the door, "What the hell are you doing here?!" She said with a scowl on her face.
"加、加持？" 美里急忙从沙发上滚下来，走到门口，"你到底在这里干什么？！" 她面带怒容地说。

"Accompanying Shinji-kun," Kaji said with a grin, "I'm his guardian."
陪着真嗣君，" 加持笑着说，"我是他的监护人。

"I should've known…hey, so you're Shinji, right?" Misato greeted.
"我早该想到的…嘿，你就是真嗣吧？" 美里打招呼道。

"Y-yes, Katsuragi-san!" Shinji tensed up, "Nice to meet you, Katsuragi-san!"
是、是的，葛城小姐！" 真嗣紧张起来，"很高兴见到你，葛城小姐！

"Just Misato is fine," she waved her hand, "why don't you guys come in?"
叫我美里就好，" 她摆了摆手，"你们不妨进来坐坐？

Asuka gave Shinji a glare that could cause him to melt on the spot, and followed Kaji inside. Shinji swallowed, 'What is she doing here? I can't get a rest, can I?'
明日香给真嗣投去一个能让他当场融化的眼神，随后跟着加持进了屋。真嗣咽了口唾沫，心想：‘她怎么会在这里？我连喘息的机会都没有吗？’

The four of them sat around a table with snacks on it. "So," Kaji started, his foot tapping Misato's. "Are you seeing anyone right now?" He asked, sounding almost innocent.
四人围坐在一张摆满零食的桌子旁。"那么，"加持开口道，脚轻轻碰了碰美里的脚。"你现在有交往对象吗？"他问道，语气几乎带着无辜。

"I don't see why that's any of your business." Misato replied, putting her arms across her chest, trying to not look towards Kaji's face.
"我不明白这跟你有什么关系。"美里回答，双臂交叉在胸前，尽量不去看加持的脸。

"I'm hurt." Kaji replied, leaning back and relaxing, and turning towards Asuka. "So, Asuka, since you're living with Katsuragi right now…tell me something," Kaji said with a sly smile, shifting his glance over at Misato for a moment, who continued to snort and grown. "Is she still, how do I say it… wild in bed?"
我受伤了。"加持回应道，向后一靠，放松下来，转向明日香。"那么，明日香，既然你现在和葛城住在一起……告诉我，"加持带着狡黠的笑容说，目光短暂地瞥向美里，后者继续哼哼唧唧。"她还是那么……怎么说呢……在床上很狂野吗？

"WHAT!" Was the collective reaction from Asuka and Misato. Utter shock and bafflement across Asuka's face, her hands trying to hide her face from reality. Shinji seemed oblivious to the situation, just confused by the reactions from the females. Misato shouted the loudest, her face turned deep red which would make Asuka's hair feel ashamed. "Wha… Why…" She grumbled, before anger flooded her, and she slammed her hands on the table, causing cups on the table to jump, her face merely inches in front of Kaji. "Just what the hell are you implying by that!?"
什么！"这是明日香和美里共同的反应。明日香脸上写满了震惊和困惑，双手试图遮住脸庞，逃避现实。真嗣似乎对情况一无所知，只是对两位女性的反应感到困惑。美里的喊声最大，她的脸涨得通红，连明日香的发色都相形见绌。"什…为什么…"她咕哝着，愤怒涌上心头，猛地拍桌，桌上的杯子都跳了起来，她的脸几乎贴到了加持的脸上。"你这话到底是什么意思！？

Kaji glanced at her, an amused look on his face, "So, it seems that Katsuragi hasn't changed at all. Am I right, Asuka?" Misato exhaled hard and collapsed back into her seat, her head buried in her hands. "Wha-what-how…" Asuka couldn't believe it. Apparently Kaji had some interesting history with Misato, which meant her chance was…minimal.
加持瞥了她一眼，脸上带着戏谑的笑容，"看来葛城一点都没变啊。我说的对吗，明日香？"美里长出一口气，瘫坐回椅子上，双手捂着脸。"什…什么…怎么…"明日香难以置信。显然加持和美里之间有些不为人知的过往，这意味着她的机会…微乎其微。

"So, I guess Asuka is also chosen by Gehirn?" Kaji changed the topic as he saw fit.
"那么，我想明日香也是被 Gehirn 选中的吧？"加持适时地转移了话题。

"This is a nightmare…" Misato was still mumbling.
"这简直是噩梦…"美里还在喃喃自语。

Asuka regained her composure, "Yeah, I'm chosen by Gehirn, Kaji-san! I'm one in a billion!" She boasted.
明日香恢复了镇定，自豪地说：“是的，我是被 Gehirn 选中的，加持先生！我是亿里挑一的！”

"Well, that's good to know," Kaji said, "this way you and Shinji could get to know each other well."
“嗯，这倒是好消息，”加持说，“这样你和真嗣就能更好地了解彼此了。”

"What?" Asuka cried, "why should I get to know such a wimpy boy like him?!"
“什么？”明日香喊道，“我为什么要去了解那种懦弱的男孩？！”

"He's also chosen by Gehirn, Asuka," Kaji blinked at the sudden change in Asuka's attitude, "You ought to know each other, at least it'll be convenient."
“他也是被 Gehirn 选中的，明日香，”加持对明日香突然的态度变化眨了眨眼，“你们应该互相了解，至少这样会方便些。”

"He's…what?!" 'I should've known it,' Asuka thought, 'The odds of us both waking up on a beach like that…and we both got chosen by Gehirn…' "Fine…whatever. Baka, how did you get chosen, anyway?"
他……什么?!" '我早该知道，' 明日香心想，'我们俩都醒在那样一个海滩上……而且都被 Gehirn 选中……' "好吧……随便了。笨蛋，你到底是怎么被选中的？

"I-I don't know?" Shinji replied, scratching his head, "I guess it's just luck…"
我……我不知道？" 真嗣回答道，挠了挠头，"我想只是运气好吧……

"Well Luck is a great talent to have, Shinji." Kaji smiled, before standing abruptly. "Well, it's been nice, but I must take my leave. I will see you all later." He exited the room, gesturing Shinji to follow him.
"运气好也是一种难得的才能，真嗣。" 加持微笑着，突然站起身来。"好了，很高兴见到大家，但我得走了。回头见。" 他离开了房间，示意真嗣跟上。

"Okay, see you!" Asuka replied, giving the man a small wave. Misato's head still in her hands, staring directly at the table. "This has to be a really bad joke, no it's a nightmare…"
好的，再见！" 明日香回应道，向那人轻轻挥了挥手。美里双手托着头，目光直直地盯着桌子。"这一定是个非常糟糕的笑话，不，这是个噩梦……

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Next Monday 下周一

"Bye, Kaji-san!" Shinji got off the car, waving his goodbye to his guardian, who happily reciprocated the gesture. Shinji wasn't surprised to see the school looked exactly the same as the Tokyo-3 First Municipal Junior High School – in fact, the name wasn't different, either.
"再见，加持先生！" 碇真嗣下了车，向他的监护人挥手告别，对方也愉快地回应了他的手势。真嗣并不惊讶地发现学校看起来和第三新东京市第一中学一模一样——实际上，名字也没有不同。

He strode into the main gate, lowering his head – he didn't want to draw attention, and he thought moving as quickly and low-profile as possible would help. Fortunately, no one seemed to pay attention to him. He could identify many of the faces, which gave him hope of seeing Kensuke and Toji again. 'We didn't exactly start on the best terms,' Shinji sighed internally, 'I hope this time things would be different.'
他大步走进正门，低下头——他不想引人注意，认为尽可能快速且低调地行动会有所帮助。幸运的是，似乎没有人注意到他。他能认出许多面孔，这让他对再次见到洞木光和铃原东治抱有希望。'我们一开始的关系并不算好，' 真嗣内心叹息，'希望这次会有所不同。'

All transfer students needed to report to the dean's office on the first day of school. Shinji found the office effortlessly based on his memories. Standing in front of the wooden grey-ish door, he hesitated as he wondered how his life would change after he opened it.
所有转学生都需要在开学第一天到教务处报到。真嗣根据记忆轻松找到了办公室。站在那扇木质灰色调的门前，他犹豫了，不知道打开门后他的生活将如何改变。

Shinji knocked on the door thrice, waiting for permission to enter. "Come in!" A familiar voice sounded behind the door. He grabbed the handle, with a slight turn, the door opened, revealing an old man with silver hair and a stern look-
真嗣敲了三次门，等待着进入的许可。"进来吧！"一个熟悉的声音从门后传来。他握住把手，轻轻一转，门开了，露出一位银发老人，神情严肃——

"Oh, hi, you must be one of the new transfer students today," the old man said with a small smile, "I'm the principal of the school, Kozo Fuyutsuki."
哦，你好，你一定是今天新转来的学生之一吧，"老人微笑着说，"我是这所学校的校长，冬月耕造。

Shinji swallowed. He did NOT expect this. "Hello, Fuyutsuki-Sensei, I-I am the transfer student." He said nervously.
真嗣咽了口口水。他完全没想到会这样。"您好，冬月老师，我、我是转学生。"他紧张地说。

"Greetings. Now, please sit down," Fuyutsuki gestured towards an empty seat, "we'll wait for the other transfer student, and we can discuss certain things together."
欢迎。现在，请坐，"冬月指着一张空椅子说，"我们等另一位转学生来了，就可以一起讨论一些事情。

Somehow Shinji had a bad feeling about this, "O-okay, Fuyutsuki-Sensei, may I ask who that is?"
不知为何，真嗣有种不好的预感，“好的，冬月老师，请问那是谁？”

"It's a girl," Shinji gulped hearing it, "she'll be here soon. It'd be better if I let you guys introduce yourselves to each other, right?"
“是个女孩，”真嗣听到这话不禁咽了口口水，“她很快就会到。让你们互相自我介绍会更好，对吧？”

"I suppose…" “我想也是……”

"…Gottverdammt! Diese Schule ist so groß! Ich kann den Weg nicht finden!" Just one minute later, the voice of an angry German sounded in the hallway, eliciting a chill ran down Shinji's spine. 'I knew that voice…' Shinji sweatdropped, 'oh crap…'
“该死！这学校太大了！我找不到路！”仅仅一分钟后，走廊里传来一个愤怒的德国人的声音，让真嗣脊背发凉。‘我认得那个声音……’真嗣额头冒汗，‘糟糕……’

Without knocking, the door was thrown open, a too-familiar redhead emerged behind it. At first her eyes widened a hair and her mouth open, but she soon regained her angry façade, "What the hell are you doing here again? I just can't get rid of you can I?!"
门被猛地推开，没有敲门，一个过于熟悉的红发女孩出现在门后。起初，她的眼睛微微睁大，嘴巴张开，但很快又恢复了愤怒的表情，“你又来这里干什么？我就是摆脱不了你，对吧？！”

"Hey, it's not like I had a choice!" Shinji shot back.
“嘿，我又不是有选择！” 真嗣反驳道。

Although she didn't want to admit it, Shinji was probably right. "Whatever. Just get this over with!" Asuka spatted, sitting down on an empty chair.
尽管她不愿承认，真嗣可能说得对。“随便吧。快点结束这一切！”明日香不悦地说着，坐到了一张空椅子上。

Fuyutsuki raised an eyebrow seeing these two arguing, but he soon decided its nothing significant. "Seeing you two have known each other already, I'll save the introduction between you guys." Kozo said with a smile, "now, I'm the headmaster of Tokyo-3 First Municipal Junior High School – as you probably already know. Here's the class schedule," Kozo took out two pieces of paper from his desk, handing them to Shinji and Asuka, "You guys can start taking classes right away. Still, I want you guys to introduce yourselves to the class first. You're both in Class-2A that is."
看到这两个人争吵，冬月扬起了一边的眉毛，但他很快认为这并不重要。“既然你们俩已经认识，我就不浪费时间介绍你们了。” 小泉微笑着说，“现在，我是第三新东京市第一初级中学的校长——你们可能已经知道了。这是课程表，”小泉从桌子里拿出两张纸，递给真嗣和明日香，“你们可以马上开始上课。不过，我希望你们先向班级自我介绍一下。你们都在 2A 班。”

Asuka shot an angry glare to Shinji, clearly dissatisfied with the arrangement, not unnoticed by Fuyutsuki.
明日香向真嗣投去愤怒的目光，显然对安排感到不满，这一幕并未逃过冬月的注意。

"Cough, I hope you guys can be more…friendly," Fuyutsuki chuckled nervously, "is there anything else you want to ask?"
咳，希望你们能更……友好一些，"冬月紧张地笑道，"还有什么问题要问吗？

"No, sir." They answered in perfect sync, much a surprise to each other, eliciting a chill ran down Fuyutsuki's spine. "Good, then. Dismissed."
没有了，先生。"他们异口同声地回答，彼此都感到意外，令冬月脊背发凉。"好，那就解散吧。

Asuka hurriedly got up from the seat and left the office, with Shinji following behind closely. 'I still agreed to the prophesier that I should…approach her, but I really don't know how is it even possible…but I guess God knows more than me…'
明日香急忙从座位上站起来，离开了办公室，真嗣紧随其后。'我还是同意了预言者的话，应该……接近她，但我真的不知道这怎么可能……不过我想上帝比我更清楚……'

They walked in silence to the stairs as Asuka started doing down. "Hmm, where are you going, Asuka?" Shinji asked.
他们默默地走向楼梯，当明日香开始下楼时，真嗣问道：“嗯，你去哪儿，明日香？”

"Well, to class, dummkopf! Where else?!" Asuka huffed, although she didn't know where the classroom was.
“当然是去上课，笨蛋！还能去哪？！”明日香气呼呼地说，尽管她并不知道教室在哪里。

"Err…the classroom is upstairs," Shinji said meekly, finger pointing upwards.
“呃……教室在楼上，”真嗣怯生生地说，手指向上指着。

"Huh, how can you be so sure? You're new to here, aren't you?" Asuka narrowed her eyes, "Class 2-A should be on the second floor, don't you think?"
“哼，你怎么这么肯定？你也是新来的，不是吗？”明日香眯起眼睛，“2-A 班应该在二楼，你不觉得吗？”

"Actually…" Shinji tried to come up with a plausible excuse, "I-I asked Kaji-san about the school, and he told me that."
实际上…" 碇真嗣试图找到一个合理的借口，"我-我问过加持先生关于学校的事，他告诉我的。

Asuka tensed up hearing the name of her crush, and she immediately accepted the explanation. "Whatever, lead the way, then."
听到自己暗恋对象的名字，明日香立刻紧张起来，并立刻接受了这一解释。"随便吧，带路吧。"

They went upstairs and found Class-2A effortlessly and waited outside of the door. Nebukawa Sensei entered the classroom, and Shinji heard a familiar "Rise! Bow! Sit!".
他们上楼轻松找到了 2A 班，并在门外等候。老师进入教室，碇真嗣听到熟悉的"起立！鞠躬！坐下！"。

"Class, before we start today I want you to welcome two transfer students," everyone in the class, including Rei Ikari, started paying attention to the normally-they-just-ignore teacher, "come in and introduce yourselves." He said to the door.
"同学们，在今天开始之前，我想让大家欢迎两位转学生，" 全班同学，包括绫波丽，开始关注平时他们通常忽略的老师，"进来介绍一下自己吧。" 他对门口说道。

Asuka and Shinji took a deep breath and walked into the classroom. He could see Toji, Kensuke, and Hikari all in the class, much to his relief. Asuka almost caught the breaths of every boy in the classroom, causing Shinji to be ignored except Rei Ikari. He simply lowered his head and followed the redhead, who in contrast had her head held high. Asuka smirked and scanned around the classroom, instantly disgusted by the looks the boys gave her. 'So many perverts to deal with…' she thought, 'but I like the attention…' she put her left hand on her hip and said, "Hello everyone, I'm Asuka La-Shikinami, charmed huh?"
明日香和真嗣深吸一口气，走进了教室。他看到东治、健介和光都在班上，这让他松了一口气。明日香几乎吸引了教室里所有男生的呼吸，使得真嗣除了绫波丽之外无人理睬。他只是低下头，跟在那个红发女孩后面，而她则高昂着头。明日香得意地环顾四周，对男生们投来的目光感到厌恶。'要对付这么多色狼……'她想，'但我喜欢这种关注……'她左手叉腰说道：“大家好，我是明日香·兰格雷，很荣幸吧？”

Rei's eyes widened in shock. Shinji tripped on the floor and choked, coughing uncontrollably. "Cough cough cough…wha-what?"
绫波的眼睛因震惊而睁大。真嗣绊了一跤，呛得咳嗽不止。“咳咳咳……什、什么？”

Asuka was confused by his sudden loss of composure, "What's wrong, Baka?"
明日香对他的突然失态感到困惑，“怎么了，笨蛋？”

"This can't be right…" he muttered, "no no no no no…"
“这不可能是真的……”他喃喃自语，“不不不不不……”

"Stop whining, everyone here is waiting!" Asuka smacked on his forehead, "Just say your name and get this over with!"
别抱怨了，这里每个人都在等你！" 明日香拍了一下他的额头，"快说出你的名字，把这事了结了！

"Al-alright, but promise you won't hit me," Shinji lowered his volume, eliciting a frown from Asuka, who simply waved her hand, "Whatever…"
好吧，但你要保证不会再打我，" 真嗣降低了音量，这让明日香皱起了眉头，她只是挥了挥手，"随便你…

Shinji took several deep breathes and regained his composure, "H-Hello everyone, my name is Shinji, Shinji-" he swallowed hard, giving one last pleading look to the redhead, "Shinji Shikinami."
真嗣深吸了几口气，恢复了镇定，"大家好，我叫真嗣，真嗣——" 他艰难地咽了口唾沫，最后向红发女孩投去恳求的一瞥，"真嗣·式波。"

The classroom exploded into chatters while Asuka froze in shock, mouth agape.
教室里顿时炸开了锅，而明日香则震惊得呆立当场，嘴巴张得老大。

"They are both Shikinamis? What the hell?"
他们都是 Shikinamis？搞什么鬼？

"Are they related? They don't look like cousins…"
他们有关系吗？看起来不像表亲……

"Are you stupid? That girl is definitely foreign! The boy looks Japanese! They CAN't be family!"
你傻吗？那女孩明显是外国人！男孩看起来像日本人！他们不可能是家人！

"Well there's only one explanation…"
嗯，只有一种解释……

"ARE THEY FUCKING MARRIED?"
他们他妈的结婚了吗？

"Lucky bastard…I was going to ask the girl out on a date…"
幸运的家伙……我本来还想约那个女孩出去约会的……

"What did the scrawny little boy do, to got married to a girl so pretty and hot?"
那个瘦小的男孩做了什么，竟然能娶到这么漂亮又火辣的女孩？

"I bet he ended the world just for her…"
我打赌他为了她毁灭了整个世界……

"Shut up guys! They don't have wedding rings on their fingers! They can't be…that!"
别吵了！他们手上没有结婚戒指！他们不可能是……那种关系！

"Yeah, maybe they just happen to have the same surname…the shock on the girl's face tells us everything…"
是啊，可能他们只是碰巧同姓……女孩脸上的震惊已经说明了一切……

Asuka was so embarrassed and dumbfounded. Without a word she grabbed Shinji's wrist and dragged him out of the classroom. She found a cleaning closet and yanked Shinji into it with her. "WHAT. THE. FUCK?" She hissed, pinning Shinji on the wall, "NOW EVERYONE IN THE CLASS THINKS WE'RE MARRIED! Not that I would ever marry someone as wimpy and weak as you!"
明日香尴尬至极，目瞪口呆。她一言不发地抓住真嗣的手腕，把他从教室里拽了出来。她找到一个清洁间，用力把真嗣拉了进去。"这.到.底.是.怎.么.回.事？"她低声怒斥，将真嗣按在墙上，"现在全班都以为我们结婚了！我才不会嫁给像你这样懦弱无能的人！"

"I-I-I was going t-to ask y-you!" Shinji stuttered, his heart sank hearing the insults, "m-my name i-is on my I-ID!" Shinji took out his ID and showed it to Asuka.
"我……我……我正要问你！"真嗣结结巴巴地说，听到这些侮辱，他的心沉了下去，"我……我的名字……在我的身份证上！"真嗣拿出身份证给明日香看。

After a careful examination, Asuka gave it back to Shinji, "Hmph. I just want you to know my real name isn't Shikinami. I came up with that name to hide my real identity," Asuka said surprisingly calmly, "my real name is Asuka Langley Soryu."
经过仔细检查后，明日香把它还给了真嗣，“哼。我只是想让你知道我的真名不是式波。我编造那个名字是为了隐藏我的真实身份，”明日香出奇地平静地说，“我的真名是明日香·兰格雷·索西耶。”

'Asuka…Langley Soryu…' Shinji felt another piece of memory rushed back to him.
'明日香……兰格雷·索西耶……'真嗣感到又一段记忆涌回心头。

"Fine, whatever. But I still gotta do this myself. I am Asuka Langley Soryu, the pilot of Unit 02, the second child. Charmed, huh?" She finished with a smirk.
"好吧，无所谓。但我还是得自己来。我是明日香·兰格雷·索西耶，二号机的驾驶员，第二适格者。很荣幸吧？"她带着一丝坏笑结束了话语。

Shinji closed his eyes. He didn't know what it meant. She's the Second Child, Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02. And he was the pilot of Unit 01. And they just happened to wake up on the beach. This can't be a coincidence. "I-I made up my name as well," Shinji said slowly, "my real name is Shinji Ikari."
真嗣闭上了眼睛。他不知道这意味着什么。她是第二适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员。而他是零号机的驾驶员。他们恰巧在海滩上醒来。这不可能是个巧合。"我-我也编造了我的名字，"真嗣缓缓地说，"我的真名是真嗣·碇。"

Asuka blinked. "I-Ikari? The same Ikari as Gendo Ikari?"
明日香眨了眨眼。“我-我叫碇？和源堂碇是同一个人吗？”

"Y-yeah, what's the problem?"
“是-是的，有什么问题吗？”

"Hun, so you are the Commander's son…" she knew NERV's Commander was Gendo Ikari when she was training to be a pilot. "so, you must know what NERV was, right?"
“哦，原来你是司令的儿子…”她知道自己在接受驾驶员训练时，NERV 的司令是源堂碇。“那么，你一定知道 NERV 是做什么的吧？”

"yeah, we fight the Angels," Shinji replied.
“是的，我们与使徒战斗，”真嗣回答道。

"What do you mean by 'we'?" Asuka asked, narrowing her eyes – 'Don't tell me he is…'
你说的'我们'是什么意思？" 明日香眯起眼睛问道，心里暗想——"别告诉我他是……

"I was the Third Child, pilot of Evangelion Unit 01," Shinji blurted out, "and you were the Second Child, pilot of Unit 02…"
我是第三适格者，驾驶着初号机，" 碇真嗣脱口而出，"而你是第二适格者，驾驶着二号机……

Asuka's eyes widened in shock, "Interesting…how do you know who I am, anyway?" 'Damn. He really WAS the Third Child. I should have known. This can't be a coincidence. Two EVA pilots woke up on a beach in a new world. How curious.'
明日香的眼睛因震惊而睁大，"有意思……你怎么知道我是谁的？" 她心想，'该死。他真的是第三适格者。我早该想到的。这不可能是个巧合。两个 EVA 驾驶员在一个新世界的海滩上醒来。真令人好奇。'

"You probably won't believe me, but we've met before…I just remembered hearing your full name…" Shinji said cautiously, trying to evade Asuka's glare, "we've met on Over the Rainbow, remember?"
你可能不会相信我，但我们以前见过……我只是刚刚想起你的全名……" 碇真嗣小心翼翼地说，试图避开明日香的目光，"我们在'彩虹之上'见过，记得吗？

'So I guess he WAS the one fighting with me in the entry plug…the dream was real, after all.' Asuka thought, 'Maybe I treated him wrong this whole time…' Her expression softened, "Hmmm…I guess you are right. I remember it as well. So," she showed a small smile to Shinji, stretching out one hand, "We… didn't really start in the best terms, did we?" Shinji chuckled nervously as he heard those words, "seeing we were EVA pilots and we fought together…I suppose we should at least get a fresh start, don't you think?"
'所以我想他确实是在插入栓里和我战斗的那个人……原来那个梦是真的。' 明日香心想，'也许我一直以来都对他不公平……' 她的表情柔和下来，"嗯……我想你是对的。我也记得。所以，" 她向真嗣露出一个微笑，伸出一只手，"我们……一开始的关系并不算好，对吧？" 真嗣听到这些话，紧张地笑了笑，"既然我们是 EVA 驾驶员，还一起战斗过……我想我们应该至少重新开始，你不觉得吗？"

Shinji raised an eyebrow at her friendliness and generosity, soon he remembered the request from the prophesier. "Of course," he shook his hands with Asuka, smiling warmly.
真嗣对她突如其来的友好和慷慨感到有些惊讶，很快他想起了预言者的请求。"当然，" 他和明日香握手，温暖地微笑着。

For some unknown reason Asuka blushed seeing the smile – she quickly turned around with a humph and left the closet. "Hurry up Baka, we're already late for class! They already think we're…in a relationship, don't let those perverts get more strange ideas!"
不知为何，明日香看到那个微笑后脸红了——她迅速哼了一声，转身离开了储物柜。"快点，笨蛋，我们上课已经迟到了！他们已经认为我们……在谈恋爱了，别让那些变态再有更多奇怪的想法！"

The duo hastily returned to class; Nebukawa-Sensei gave them a disapproval look and said, "Shikinami-san and Shikinami-kun," his words triggered a round of laughter in the class, "please choose your seat. I'll spare today's misdemeanor since you're new here."
两人匆忙返回教室；老师不满地看了他们一眼，说道：“式波同学和式波君，”他的话引起了一阵哄笑，“请选择你们的座位。鉴于你们是新来的，我今天就不追究你们的过失了。”

"Hai." Shinji and Asuka said in unison. Looking around the classroom, there were only three empty seats with two of them side by side and one in the far corner. Asuka huffed and picked her seat, eyeing Shinji to sit next to her.
“明白。”真嗣和明日香异口同声地回答。环顾教室，只剩下三个空位，其中两个并排，一个在角落。明日香哼了一声，选了自己的座位，示意真嗣坐在她旁边。

Shinji was tempting to sit as far away as possible, but after today's revelations, he didn't mind being close to Asuka anymore, so he complied and sat down beside Asuka.
真嗣本想尽可能坐得远一些，但经过今天的种种，他不再介意与明日香靠近，于是顺从地坐在了她旁边。

The class resumed and Nebukawa-Sensei started, "In the year of 2008 there was a financial crisis…" Shinji sighed in relief. At least sensei wouldn't talk about Second Impact anymore.
课堂继续进行，老师开始讲道：“2008 年发生了一场金融危机……”真嗣松了口气。至少老师不会再谈论第二次冲击了。

XXXXXXXXXXXX

The rest of the school day was uneventful. Shinji didn't have a chance to talk to Toji and Kensuke since they were occupied with each other. The fraternization could wait, though. He and Asuka had a more important job – their first day at work.
学校剩下的日子平淡无奇。由于东治和健介正忙着彼此交谈，真嗣没有机会与他们说话。结交朋友可以等等，但他和明日香有更重要的任务——他们的第一天工作。

The duo waited at the school gate for their respective guardians. Kaji showed up first in his car, "Kaji-san!" Asuka said sweetly, completely different from her usual self, making Shinji sweatdropped, 'What the hell was that? Is she having a crush on my guardian or something?' "Hello, Kaji-san!" Shinji greeted, "we're going to Gehirn, right?"
两人在学校门口等待各自的监护人。加持先生首先开车到达，“加持先生！”明日香甜甜地喊道，与平时的她判若两人，让真嗣不禁汗颜，‘这是怎么回事？她难道对我的监护人有了好感？’“你好，加持先生！”真嗣打招呼，“我们要去 Gehirn，对吧？”

"Hello, kiddos," Kaji said, "you two get in the car. Katsuragi asked me to pick you both up, since we all have the same destination."
“嗨，孩子们，”加持说，“你们俩上车吧。葛城让我来接你们，因为我们都要去同一个地方。”

Asuka was more than happy to do so, and she hastily opened the front door and sat on the passenger's seat, next to Kaji. Shinji grumbled in annoyance, and sat on the back of the car.
明日香非常乐意这样做，她急忙打开前门，坐在副驾驶座上，紧挨着加持。真嗣不满地嘟囔着，坐到了车后座。

Kaji pressed the acceleration pedal and the car shot forward; with his impeccable driving skills, Kaji managed to evade most of the traffic in swift motions, breaking at least 5 separate traffic laws. At the same time, Asuka and Shinji could only hold on to the handle and pray for their life.
加治踩下油门，汽车猛地向前冲去；凭借精湛的驾驶技术，加治迅速避开了大部分车流，至少违反了五项交通法规。与此同时，明日香和真嗣只能紧握把手，祈祷自己能活下来。

Thankfully the ride was soon over. Kaji drove the car into one of the elevators, waiting for it to carry them to the ground level.
幸好这段旅程很快就结束了。加治将车驶入一部电梯，等待它将他们运送到地面层。

"You're not doing much today," Kaji suddenly spoke, trying to break the silence, "just a physical check for you both, including measuring sizes of your bodies, so they could make suitable plug suits."
“你们今天没什么事，”加治突然开口，试图打破沉默，“只是做个身体检查，包括测量你们的身体尺寸，以便制作合适的插入栓服。”

"Plug suits… I'm sure my body will look good in them, don't you think, Kaji-san?" Asuka tried to flirt with him, to see how he would react.
“插入栓服……我穿上它们一定很好看，你不觉得吗，加治先生？”明日香试图向他调情，看看他会有什么反应。

Kaji grimaced, 'Why is she saying that? Is she trying to get my attention? But she's too young…and I'm already in love with someone else…' "No doubt, Asuka. I'm sure you can make a lot of boyfriends your age." He emphasized the last words.
加濑皱眉，心想：'她为什么这么说？是想引起我的注意吗？但她太年轻了……而且我已经爱上了别人……' "毫无疑问，明日香。我相信你能找到很多同龄的男朋友。" 他特别强调了最后几个字。

Asuka pouted, 'Not so much different from the Kaji I knew…always treat me like kids, not adults…and since this Kaji doesn't even know me before, I guess I really have zero chance with him…' "Sure. Whatever." The sweetness in her tone was completely gone, much to Kaji and Shinji's relief.
明日香撅起嘴，心想：'和我认识的加濑没什么两样……总是把我当小孩，不把我当大人……而且这个加濑之前根本不认识我，看来我真的没机会了……' "当然。随便吧。" 她语气中的甜蜜完全消失了，这让加濑和真嗣都松了一口气。

The trio arrived at the Medical Wing and waited outside the examination room. Shinji went in first.
三人到达医疗翼，在检查室外等候。真嗣先进去了。

"Hello, you must be Shinji, right?" A blonde doctor asked, who Shinji recognized as Ritsuko Akagi.
"你好，你一定是真嗣，对吧？" 一位金发医生问道，真嗣认出她是赤木律子。

"Yes, doctor," Shinji replied.
"是的，医生，" 真嗣回答道。

"Good, I'm Ritsuko Akagi," the blonde said, "let's get straight to business. Lay down on the bed," she commanded.
"很好，我是律子·赤木，" 金发女子说道，"我们直接进入正题。躺到床上，" 她命令道。

Shinji was used to her formality and coldness, so he simply complied. Ritsuko started doing her procedures, checking the heartbeat, listening to the breathes, taking blood samples, checking visions, and so on. At last, she put Shinji under some weird scanner, "Don't worry, this is to scan your brain waveform. It should be done in five minutes. We'll do more extensive tests once you get into your test plugs." Shinji simply nodded since he had already done something similar after his first sortie against Sachiel – not that this Ritsuko Akagi would ever know, anyway.
真嗣已经习惯了她的正式和冷淡，所以他只是顺从了。律子开始进行她的程序，检查心跳，聆听呼吸，抽取血液样本，检查视力，等等。最后，她让真嗣躺进一个奇怪的扫描仪中，"别担心，这是为了扫描你的脑波。五分钟内就能完成。等你进入测试插头后，我们还会进行更全面的测试。" 真嗣只是点了点头，因为他已经在第一次与使徒萨基尔交战后经历过类似的事情——尽管这位律子·赤木永远不会知道。

"Okay you are good for now." Ritsuko said, "put the clothes on and leave, don't forget to call the other one to come in."
好了，你现在可以了。" 律子说，"穿上衣服离开，别忘了叫下一个人进来。

"Hai." Shinji replied, not having any tone in his words. He quickly put on his newly bought garments and stepped outside, "Asuka, it's your turn."
嗨。" 真嗣回答道，语气中没有任何起伏。他迅速穿上新买的衣服，然后走出房间，"明日香，轮到你了。

"Yeah I know that," Asuka said, "let's get this over with."
我知道了，" 明日香说，"让我们快点结束吧。

The procedures were relatively the same for Asuka. However there was one thing Dr. Akagi wanted to make sure of. "Asuka, take off your underwear and spread your legs," Ritsuko said coldly.
对于明日香来说，程序大致相同。但有一件事，赤木博士想要确认。"明日香，脱掉你的内裤，分开双腿，" 律子冷冷地说。

"Huh? Are you interested in girls or something?" Asuka mocked.
"嗯？你对女孩子感兴趣吗？" 明日香嘲讽道。

Ritsuko's frowned, "I'm a doctor, show me some respect, little girl."
律子皱眉道：“我是个医生，给我点尊重，小姑娘。”

"What do you want to know exactly? That if I fucked around?" Asuka scoffed, "I'm not some irresponsible and indecent adult! I'm a prim and proper young lady!"
“你到底想知道什么？难道我胡闹过吗？”明日香嗤之以鼻，“我可不是那种不负责任、不检点的成年人！我是个端庄得体的年轻女士！”

"Just do it! We can't afford pregnant test subjects, that's all. And you're making this hard for both of us!"
“快做吧！我们可承担不起怀孕的实验对象，仅此而已。你这样让双方都难办！”

"Fine, fine, whatever." Asuka complied and took off her undergarments, spreading her legs.
“好吧，好吧，随你。”明日香顺从地脱下内衣，张开双腿。

"Hmmm…interesting," a sly grin appeared a Ritsuko's face after she examined Asuka's nether regions, "why I don't see your…proof of innocence, then?"
嗯……有意思，" 在审视了明日香的私处后，律子脸上露出了狡黠的笑容，"那我怎么没看到你的……清白证明呢？

"What." It's all Asuka could say.
"什么。" 明日香只能说出这个词。

"I'm saying you're not a virgin, Asuka-chan," Ritsuko said mockingly, "such a prim and proper young lady you are!"
我是说你已经不是处女了，明日香小妹妹，" 律子嘲讽地说，"你可真是个端庄规矩的年轻女士啊！

"I'M NOT WHAT?" 我不是什么？

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Asuka was fuming. She lost her virginity without knowing when, where, and whom. But somehow she just knew it was Shinji's fault.
明日香怒火中烧。她失去了贞操，却不知何时、何地、与何人。但不知怎的，她就是知道这是真嗣的错。

She stomped down the hallway and found Shinji waiting for her at the exit of Medical Wing. He smiled at her seeing her approaching, but immediately gulped and flinched as he saw the raging expression on Asuka's face and the murderous look she gave him.
她怒气冲冲地走过走廊，发现真嗣正在医疗翼出口等她。看到她走近，他微笑着，但随即咽了口口水，畏缩了一下，因为他看到了明日香脸上愤怒的表情和那杀气腾腾的眼神。

"Asuka what's wrong-" his sentence was cut off by a powerful uppercut from Asuka, who wasted no time and shoved him to the ground. She then pinned him on the ground, giving Shinji a death-glare while hyperventilating. Shinji was terrified – he didn't know why but he knew he'd better not do or say anything, or the next moment he would become a pile of bloody pulp.
"明日香，你怎么了——"他的话还没说完，就被明日香一记强有力的上勾拳打断，她毫不犹豫地将他推倒在地。随后，她将他按在地上，用死亡凝视盯着他，同时急促地呼吸。真嗣吓坏了——他不知道为什么，但他知道最好不要做或说任何事，否则下一刻他就会变成一堆血肉模糊的肉块。

Nonetheless Asuka still started beating him into the torso senselessly. "WHY! WHY? WHY?!"
尽管如此，明日香还是开始毫无理智地击打他的躯干。"为什么！为什么？为什么？！"

"A-A-Asu-suka wha-what-ha-happen-pened?" Shinji stammered out incoherent words as his lungs were having trouble breathing, "p-p-le-lease-t-talk-to-me!" He made minimal resistance, however.
"啊-啊-阿苏-苏卡，怎-怎么-么-发-发生了？" 真嗣结结巴巴地吐出断断续续的话语，他的肺部呼吸困难，"请-请-跟-跟我-说-说话！" 然而，他几乎没有反抗。

Asuka stopped beating him after several hard punches, grasping his shirt tightly. With a loud and frustrated groan, she stood up and turned around. "Don't come near me ever again," she said in a dangerously low voice, "Just…don't."
在狠狠地打了真嗣几拳后，明日香停了下来，紧紧抓住他的衬衫。她站起来，转过身，发出一声响亮而沮丧的呻吟。"别再靠近我，" 她用一种危险的低沉声音说道，"就…别再靠近。"

Without another word Asuka left the Medical Wing, leaving a dumbfounded and hurting Shinji on the ground.
明日香没有再说一句话，离开了医疗翼，留下一脸茫然、疼痛的真嗣躺在地上。

"What…what did I do?" 我…我做了什么？

At the moment, Earth Orbit
此刻，地球轨道

"Asuka, we have a problem."
明日香，我们遇到了问题。

"Hmm?" 嗯？

"Your counterpart tried to kill mine again."
你的对手又试图杀害我的对手了。

"Wha-what? What's the reason this time?"
什、什么？这次又是什么原因？

"I-" the God Shinji blushed, "I-so, Dr. Akagi gave your counterpart a physical today."
我、我……所以，赤木博士今天给你的对应体做了体检。

"So?" the God Asuka still hadn't realized the severity of the problem.
"那又怎样？" 神之明日香还没有意识到问题的严重性。

"Your body…so, remember the time when we were trapped in the same entry plug for nine hours during the attack of eleventh Angel? That's when I took your virginity in this world, right?" Shinji asked.
"你的身体……所以，记得我们被困在同一个插入栓里九个小时的那次，第十一使徒来袭的时候吗？那次在这个世界我夺走了你的初夜，对吧？" 真嗣问道。

"Yes, and?" 是的，然后呢？

"Your body… didn't regenerate a hymen when our counterparts…revived in the new world."
你的身体…在新的世界中，我们的对应体复活时，并没有再生处女膜。

"Oh. Fuck." The God Asuka gulped as realization dawned on her, "I mean - Fuck."
哦。该死。" 神阿苏卡咽了口唾沫，随着真相的浮现，"我是说 - 该死。

"Neither of them knows it was me, who…" the God Shinji blushed harder, "I'm sorry. I put your counterpart in distress, and mine in danger…"
他们俩都不知道是我，谁…" 神真嗣脸红得更厉害了，"对不起。我让你的对应体陷入困境，让我的对应体处于危险之中…

"It's not your fault, Shinji," the God Asuka said, "Knowing me, although I treasure my innocence, they'll get over it…eventually. Let's just hope she doesn't remember…soon."
这不是你的错，真嗣，" 神明日香说道，"了解我的人，虽然我珍视我的纯洁，但他们最终会接受的……希望她不会很快记起来。

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Shinji was sulking in his living quarters, but also very confused. He had asked Dr. Akagi about Asuka's outburst while she was dealing with the bruises and scratches he received from Asuka; Dr. Akagi told him about Asuka's…condition. 'Why is this all happening to me? Why did she think it was me who…she must've lost her virginity during those nine months. She just doesn't remember it! I hope she remembers soon, so she won't bother me about it anymore…And I don't see how it is any of my business! I wonder whether the prophesier knows anything about it…' Shinji brooded in the bed.
真嗣在他的住处闷闷不乐，同时也非常困惑。他向赤木博士询问了明日香爆发的原因，当时她正在处理他从明日香那里受到的瘀伤和擦伤；赤木博士告诉他明日香的……状况。'为什么这一切都发生在我身上？为什么她会认为是我……她一定是在那九个月里失去了童贞。她只是不记得了！我希望她能快点记起来，这样她就不会再为此烦我了……而且我也不认为这和我有什么关系！不知道预言者是否知道些什么……' 真嗣躺在床上沉思。

He tossed and turned in his bed, trying to clear his thoughts. However each toss and turn would hurt him due to his injuries inflicted by the angry redhead. He groaned in pain, grabbed another dose of painkillers, and swallowed them with water.
他在床上辗转反侧，试图理清思绪。然而每一次翻身都会因那位愤怒的红发少女造成的伤痛而痛苦。他痛苦地呻吟着，抓起另一剂止痛药，用水吞下。

Shinji sighed. He figured he could at least use the time to do something more meaningful. Turning around to face Kaji across the room, he asked, "Kaji-san? Are you awake?"
真嗣叹了口气。他想至少可以利用这段时间做些更有意义的事情。他转过身来，面对房间另一边的加持，问道："加持先生？您醒着吗？"

"Yes, Shinji-kun," Kaji answered immediately, "I can see you're struggling to sleep, so as a guardian I kept myself awake so I could aid you in case you need it. Damn, that girl really did a number on you!"
是的，真嗣君，" 加持立刻回答道，"我能看出你难以入睡，所以作为监护人，我让自己保持清醒，以便在你需要时能帮助你。该死，那女孩真是让你受苦了！

"Thanks, Kaji-san," Shinji smiled, "you're the best."
谢谢，加持先生，" 真嗣微笑着说，"你是最棒的。

Kaji chuckled, "No problem, kiddo. What do you want?"
加持轻笑一声，"没事，小伙子。你想问什么？"

"I-how to, emmm, how to approach girls?" Shinji asked with a blush, unnoticed by Kaji due to the darkness of the room.
"我...怎么，嗯，怎么接近女孩子？" 真嗣红着脸问道，由于房间昏暗，加持并未察觉到他的脸红。

"Well, the kanji we use for the word 'she' literally means 'the woman far away.' To us men, women will always appear to be on the opposite shore. It means we may never truly understand them." Kaji replied with a sorrowful tone, "why ask, Shinji-kun? Got someone on your mind?"
嗯，我们用来表示'她'的汉字，字面意思是'远处的女人'。对我们男人来说，女人似乎总是站在对岸。这意味着我们可能永远无法真正理解她们。" 薰用悲伤的语气回答道，"为什么问这个，真嗣君？你心里有人吗？

"yeah, Kaji-san," Shinji said, scratching the back of his head, "I thought you might be good at dealing with women, you're handsome, confident and all that…"
是的，薰先生，" 真嗣说，挠了挠后脑勺，"我以为你在处理女人方面很在行，你英俊、自信，还有其他那些……

Kaji chuckled, "I haven't been able to get together with the woman I want…"
薰轻笑一声，"我还没能和我想要的女人在一起……"

"Is she Misato-san?" Shinji asked.
"是美里小姐吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah…" Kaji blurted out, "who's the girl of your dreams, Shinji-kun?"
嗯……" 加持脱口而出，"真嗣君，你梦中的女孩是谁呢？

"You probably won't believe me…" Shinji sighed, "it's Asuka…"
你可能不会相信我……" 真嗣叹了口气，"是明日香……

Kaji blinked in surprise, "Asuka? The girl who beat you relentlessly today? The girl who literally does nothing but yell at you?" Kaji was very confused, "To be honest, I DID deal with a lot of girls, but none of them was as…temperamental as Asuka. I don't know about you, but I don't really like her."
加持惊讶地眨了眨眼，"明日香？就是今天把你打得落花流水的那位？那个除了对你大喊大叫什么都不做的女孩？" 加持感到非常困惑，"说实话，我确实接触过很多女孩，但没有一个是像明日香这样……脾气火爆的。我不知道你怎么想，反正我不是很喜欢她。"

'I don't, either, at least not yet…' Shinji thought sadly, 'but it's God itself who asked me to do it…how could I tell you that? Now I actually doubt whether I should…keep approaching her. I mean, if all she does is to push me away, why am I putting up with her?' "Kaji-san, I know… she's…hard to deal with, but I just have this feeling that… she's the one for me, you know? Like the God is trying to pair us."
'我也不喜欢，至少目前还不喜欢……' 真嗣悲伤地想，'但这是上帝让我这么做的……我怎么能告诉你呢？现在我甚至怀疑我是否应该……继续接近她。我是说，如果她只是想把我推开，我为什么要忍受她呢？' "加持先生，我知道……她很难相处，但我就是有这种感觉……她就是我的命中注定，你明白吗？就像是上帝在试图把我们配对。"

Kaji sighed, "I'm happy that you found someone, Shinji, but I doubt she feels the same way about you."
加濑叹了口气，“真嗣，你找到了人，我很高兴，但我怀疑她对你的感觉也是一样的。”

"I-I don't know," Shinji said sullenly, "I just had the feeling." His mind wandered back to the dream he had days ago…
“我，我不知道，”真嗣闷闷不乐地说，“我只是有这种感觉。”他的思绪飘回到几天前的那个梦……

"…how am I gonna say this…try to ask her out? Date her? Make her yours? Give yourself to her? Nah…those are too much to ask for now, how about this…be there for her. Don't run away."
“……我该怎么表达呢……试着约她出去？和她约会？让她属于你？把自己交给她？不……现在问这些太过分了，这样如何……在她身边。不要逃避。”

"I'm serious, Don't. Leave. Her."
“我是认真的，不要。离开。她。”

"She doesn't mean what she says…for most of the time."
她并非总是言为心声……大多数时候都是如此。

"Trust me, Shinji, I know her better than anyone. You are the only one who can understand her in this world, except me that is."
相信我，真嗣，我比任何人都了解她。在这个世界上，除了我，只有你能理解她。

Shinji sighed again, "I can only hope…she was nice to me…but I just have to mess it up…"
真嗣再次叹息，"我只能希望……她曾对我友好……但我就是搞砸了……"

"She was nice to you? Huh," Kaji said in surprise, "if your mind is set, I won't stop you, Shinji-kun. I will help you…if I can."
她对你友好？哈，" 薰惊讶地说，"如果你决心已定，我不会阻止你，真嗣君。我会尽力帮助你……如果我能的话。

"Thanks, Kaji-san." Shinji rolled back, "Goodnight, Kaji-san." 'I need help now, whoever you are…prophesier or something…'
"谢谢，加持先生。" 真嗣退后一步，"晚安，加持先生。" '我现在需要帮助，无论你是谁…预言者还是什么…'

"Goodnight, Shinji-kun." 晚安，真嗣君。

AN: Man, who would saw that coming? Asuka and Shinji's relationship took a deep dive just after the first sign of meditation…Now it seemed like only the God Shinji and Asuka could help them… :/ Now they figured each other out…as EVA pilots. Let's just hope the bond would bring them together.
作者按：天哪，谁会预料到呢？明日香和真嗣的关系在第一次冥想迹象后就急剧恶化…现在看来，似乎只有神一般的真嗣和明日香能帮助他们… :/ 现在他们彼此了解了…作为 EVA 驾驶员。只希望这种纽带能让他们走到一起。

### Chapter 3: You Cannot Escape
你无法逃避

Misato was very worried. She had heard about the atrocious incident in the Medical Wing today; after reading the initial report, she wasn't sure who was to blame, Shinji or Asuka. She was Asuka's guardian, so she had a natural tendency to defend her actions, at least in public. This didn't mean she wouldn't give her a tongue-lash once she gets home, where no one else could hear them. From the several days they've been living together, Misato had come to learn that Asuka's pride was not something to mess with just for fun.
美里非常担忧。她听说了今天医疗翼发生的可怕事件；在阅读了初步报告后，她不确定该责怪谁，是真嗣还是明日香。她是明日香的监护人，因此在公众场合自然倾向于维护她的行为。但这并不意味着她不会在回家后对她进行一番严厉的训斥，那时没有其他人能听见。从他们共同生活的这几天来看，美里已经了解到，明日香的骄傲不是可以随便拿来开玩笑的。

Misato entered the apartment and was welcomed by the smell of overcooked vegetables, half-raw meat, and burnt rice. She didn't need to check to know Asuka had screwed up cooking again. Sighing, she shouted to the kitchen, "Asuka! You know you could always use the knife if you want it painless for me, convenient for you!"
美里走进公寓，迎面扑来的是煮过头的蔬菜、半生不熟的肉和烧焦的米饭的味道。她不用检查就知道明日香又在做饭上搞砸了。她叹了口气，朝厨房喊道：“明日香！你知道的，如果你想让我少受点罪，对你来说也方便的话，你大可以用刀子！”

It took Asuka four long seconds to realize what Misato meant. She dropped the pan on the stove with a huge clank, shot Misato a venomous glare, and yelled, "Well it's still way better than whatever shit you made!" In fact, the very reason preventing Asuka from throwing the pan into Misato's face was that she knew too well that she had messed up.
足足过了四秒钟，明日香才明白美里话里的意思。她猛地将平底锅摔在炉灶上，发出巨大的哐啷声，恶狠狠地瞪了美里一眼，吼道：“那也比你做的那些烂东西强多了！”其实，阻止明日香把锅砸向美里的唯一原因，是她自己心里清楚，这次确实是搞砸了。

Misato swallowed; she'd never seen Asuka this angry before. Whether it was because something bad happened that day – which was probably the incident with Shinji, or Asuka was just irritable, she couldn't tell. But one thing she was sure of – she didn't want to escalate the situation. "No need to get mad, Asuka, I was only joking," Misato said cautiously.
美里咽了咽口水；她从未见过明日香如此愤怒。不知是因为那天发生了什么糟糕的事——很可能是与真嗣有关的那件事，还是明日香只是心情烦躁，她无从得知。但有一点她很确定——她不想让事态升级。“别生气，明日香，我只是开个玩笑，”美里小心翼翼地说。

Asuka sighed, "I'm just… it's been a long day," now that confirmed Misato's suspicion.
明日香叹了口气，“我只是……今天真是漫长的一天，”这话证实了美里的猜想。

"Wanna talk about it?" “想聊聊吗？”

"No, not really," Asuka replied tiredly, her temper completely gone, "it's…personal."
不，其实不是，" 明日香疲惫地回答，她的脾气已经完全消失，"这是……私人的事。

"Now, I'm your guardian, and I care about my charge, which is you, Asuka," Misato said forcefully, "even if you don't want to, I'll have to know what happened."
现在，我是你的监护人，我关心我的被监护人，也就是你，明日香，" 美里坚定地说，"即使你不愿意，我也必须知道发生了什么。

"Didn't you read it on your report?" Asuka asked, annoyed. She talked when she's ready; she didn't like being forced into anything. She wanted to make her own choices.
"你不是已经在报告上看过了吗？" 明日香不耐烦地问。她想说话时自然会说；她不喜欢被迫做任何事。她想要自己做决定。

"Yes, but it's too vague, and I want to hear it from you," Misato pushed forward, "maybe you think I won't care, Asuka, but the truth is I do, I really do care about your well-being. Not only your health is important to your job, and my job as well," she paused for a second, waiting for a reaction. Asuka simply stared at the stove, not making any movements, "but also I care about the girl called Asuka."
是的，但那太模糊了，我想听你亲口说，" 美里继续追问，"也许你认为我不会在乎，明日香，但事实是我真的在乎，我真的很关心你的福祉。不仅你的健康对你的工作重要，对我的工作也同样重要，" 她停顿了一下，等待反应。明日香只是盯着炉子，没有任何动作，"而且我关心那个名叫明日香的女孩。

Asuka felt an unspoken warmth grew inside her chest. Misato sounded just like the Kaji she knew – and totally different from the drunk and sloppy Misato she was familiar with. Thinking it rationally, she thought it wouldn't hurt to tell her about her…condition, since Misato was…experienced in the subject, and most importantly – she's a female. There wouldn't be any embarrassment. "Fine," she started, "I'll talk…later. But I'm hungry now, can we at least order some takeout first?"
明日香感到一股无言的温暖在胸中蔓延。美里此刻的声音，就像她所认识的加持先生一样——与她熟悉的那个醉醺醺、邋遢的美里截然不同。理性地想，告诉她自己的……状况，应该无伤大雅，毕竟美里在这方面经验丰富，而且最重要的是——她是女性。这样就不会有什么尴尬了。"好吧，"她开口道，"我待会儿说……但现在我饿了，我们能不能先叫点外卖？"

Misato smiled at her success in cracking Asuka's shell, "Of course, Asuka-chan!"
美里对自己的成功感到满意，她打破了明日香的防线，微笑着说："当然可以，明日香酱！"

Asuka cleaned up the mess in the kitchen while Misato picked up the landline to order food. "We really need someone who cooks…" Asuka murmured as she put the disks into the cupboard, "and cooks well…"
明日香在厨房收拾残局，而美里则拿起座机订餐。"我们真的需要一个会做饭的人……"明日香一边把盘子放进橱柜，一边低声嘟囔，"而且要做得好……"

an hour later 1 小时后

Asuka sat on the couch while Misato sat on a pillow on the floor, across the table. "So," she started, "what happened today?"
明日香坐在沙发上，而美里则坐在地板的垫子上，隔着桌子相对。“那么，”她开口道，“今天发生了什么事？”

Asuka sighed, burying her face in her hands, "It's about Baka-Shinji."
明日香叹了口气，双手捂住脸，“是关于笨蛋真嗣的事。”

"I knew that already, you beat him up pretty hard," Misato gave her a disapproving frown, "why did you do that? Did he…do something improper?"
“我早就知道了，你把他打得很惨，”美里皱着眉头表示不满，“为什么要这么做？他…做了什么不妥的事吗？”

"I…" in retrospect, Asuka knew she was very unreasonable at that time. He was as clueless as her, she could see genuine confusion and fear in his eyes. Hell, she didn't even know why she had thought Shinji, of all people, was the one who took her virginity in the first place. The conclusion didn't come out as rationalization, but more of an instinct – like someone told you one plus one, and your head just came up with two.
“我…”回想起来，明日香知道自己当时非常无理取闹。他跟她一样茫然，她能从他的眼中看到真实的困惑和恐惧。该死，她甚至不知道为什么一开始就认定是真嗣夺走了她的初夜。这个结论并非出于理性分析，更像是一种直觉——就像有人告诉你一加一，你的脑海里自然而然就浮现出二。

She felt guilty. 她感到内疚。

However it did little to soothe her nerves. There were only two possibilities, whether she had sex with someone during the nine months she forgot about, or Shinji did something indecent before she woke up on the beach. "Dr. Akagi gave me a physical today, and…I-I-" Asuka sighed, "you must've got the report on my physical condition, right Misato?"
然而这并未能平复她的神经。只有两种可能，要么是她在这九个月遗忘期间与某人发生了关系，要么是真嗣在她醒来前在海滩上做了什么不检点的事。“赤木博士今天给我做了体检，然后…我-我-”明日香叹了口气，“你肯定已经拿到了我的体检报告，对吧，美里？”

"Of course, Asuka," Misato confirmed, "and that's…another thing I wanna talk about."
“当然，明日香，”美里确认道，“而且那…是另一件我想谈的事。”

"Just stop beating around the bush already! I'm pretty sure what you want to talk about is related to the incident."
“别再拐弯抹角了！我敢肯定你想谈的和那件事有关。”

"O-okay, then let's start with your…physical conditions," Misato smiled an uneasy smile, "so…nothing big to worry about, Dr. Akagi said you are in perfect health, and your muscles are incredibly powerful," seeing Asuka raising an eyebrow, she continued, "however, there is one thing I'm worried about…Asuka, you said you're fourteen, isn't it a bit young to…"
那好吧，我们就从你的...身体状况开始谈起，" 葛城美里带着些许不安的微笑说道，"所以...没什么大问题，赤木博士说你身体非常健康，肌肉力量也异常强大，" 看到明日香挑起眉毛，她继续说，"不过，有一件事让我有些担心...明日香，你说你十四岁，是不是有点太年轻了...

"Okay, okay I get it," Asuka blushed and interrupted Misato, "that's exactly why I was so mad – I don't know who, where, or when. I…argh but I just had the feeling it has something to do with that idiot!"
好了好了，我明白了，" 明日香脸红着打断了葛城美里，"这正是我那么生气的原因——我不知道是谁，在哪里，什么时候。我...唉，但我就是觉得这事儿跟那个笨蛋有关！

Misato blinked, "Seriously, Asuka, you don't know? Huh," she stared into Asuka's eyes for a moment and saw genuine sincerity, "but it's not something to beat Shinji over with, don't you think?"
葛城美里眨了眨眼，"真的吗，明日香，你不知道？嗯，" 她凝视着明日香的眼睛，看到了真挚的诚恳，"但这不是用来责怪真嗣的理由，你不觉得吗？"

"I-" hard to admit, but Misato's right. She let her emotions and reflex took over her reasoning in a stressful situation. Although she did it a LOT, in retrospect she knew she was wrong. Asuka sighed, "okay, maybe I was a little harsh. What do you want me to do, then?"
我-" 虽然难以启齿，但葛城美里说得对。她在压力情境下让情绪和本能占据了理智的上风。尽管她经常这么做，事后回想，她知道自己错了。明日香叹了口气，"好吧，可能我确实有点过分了。那你想让我怎么做呢？

"I want you to apologize," Misato said, eliciting a grumble from Asuka, "since you'll be studying in the same school and working at the same place, I NEED you guys to at least tolerate each other. Is that too much to ask?"
我希望你道歉，" 葛城美里说道，引得惣流·明日香·兰格雷嘟囔了一声，"既然你们将在同一所学校学习，又在同一个地方工作，我需要你们至少能相互容忍。这个要求过分吗？

But the great Asuka Longley Soryu never apologized…at least hardly ever. She only apologized when she knew she messed up BIG, or when she was with Kaji. "I… I'll think about it," she finally replied after 10 seconds of hesitation, "I really need to go to sleep now…" she yawned.
但伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不轻易道歉……至少几乎不。她只在知道自己犯了大错，或者在加持面前时才会道歉。"我……我会考虑的，" 经过十秒的犹豫后，她终于回答，"我现在真的需要去睡觉了……" 她打了个哈欠。

"Okay, but I want a committal answer next morning," receiving a nod from the redhead, Misato continued, "Goodnight, then."
好的，但我希望明早能得到一个明确的答复，" 看到红发少女点头，葛城美里继续说，"那么，晚安了。

"Goodnight, Misato…" 晚安，葛城……

Sending Asuka to her room, Misato entered her room as well, pulling out her phone. "Hmmm…hello? It's me, Kaji…"
将明日香送回房间后，美里也走进了自己的房间，掏出手机。“嗯……喂？是我，加持……”

"Hello, Katsuragi, inviting me on a date?"
“你好啊，葛城，这是要约我出去吗？”

"Cut the bullshits, Ryoji!" She hissed, "I'm here to talk business."
“少废话，加持！”她低声斥道，“我找你是谈正事的。”

"Sure, sure, my highness."
“当然，当然，我的女王。”

"Isn't it weird that both Asuka and Shinji have the same surname?" she speculated, "and neither they seem to be on good terms…"
是不是很奇怪，明日香和真嗣居然同姓？" 她推测道，"而且他们俩看起来关系也不怎么好……

"I'm digging on it, I suspect there's a whole conspiracy going on…"
我正在深入调查，我怀疑这里面藏着一整个阴谋……

"Wait, are you telling me that you SPY on Gehirn, THROUGH THE PHONE? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?" Misato practically yelled, unable to believe it.
"等等，你是说你通过电话监视 Gehirn？你疯了吗？" 美里几乎是大声喊出来的，难以置信。

"Don't worry, no one's eavesdropping. I'm pro in Anti-reconnaissance."
别担心，没人能偷听。我在反侦察方面可是专业的。

"But what makes you think I wouldn't report you to Gehirn?"
但你凭什么认为我不会向 Gehirn 举报你？

A chuckle, "I haven't done anything harmful, anyway. And I believe you won't tell. Don't you also want to know the truth?"
一声轻笑，"反正我也没做什么有害的事。而且我相信你不会说出去的。难道你不想知道真相吗？"

"What truth?" 什么真相？

"The secret plan Gehirn is developing."
Gehirn 正在秘密开发的计划。

"Wha-what?" 什...什么？

A sigh, "forget about it for now, Katsruagi. I'll tell you once I find out. By the way, do you have time this Saturday? I've found…"
一声叹息，"现在先别管了，胜己。等我弄清楚了再告诉你。对了，这周六你有空吗？我发现……"

Misato hanged up. She didn't need to listen to Kaji's awkward attempt asking her out on a date.
明日香挂断了电话。她不需要听完加持那笨拙的邀约尝试。

The office darkened, twelve holograms of black monoliths emerged.
办公室暗了下来，十二座黑色巨碑的 hologram 浮现出来。

"Ikari, is there any interesting result you get from the physical examinations of The Two?" SEELE 01 asked.
"碇，从‘The Two’的体检中得到什么有趣的结果了吗？" SEELE 01 问道。

"Nothing abnormal, save for the inconceivable physical strength which themselves probably don't even know existed." Gendo answered, "there's no apparent cause for it. We may need them inside our test plugs to yield more results."
除了他们自己可能都不知道的难以置信的体力外，并无异常。" 源渡回答，"其原因尚不明显。我们或许需要让他们进入测试插头中以获得更多结果。

"Arrange it as soon as possible," SEELE 02 said.
"尽快安排，" SEELE 02 说。

"We plan to have them in there tomorrow," Gendo confirmed, "then Dr. Naoko Akagi could do her tests."
我们计划让他们明天进去，" 源堂确认道，"这样赤木直子博士就可以进行她的测试了。

"Good. Now, what do you think about the incident between The Two today?" SEELE 05 huffed.
"很好。那么，你对今天两位之间发生的事件有何看法？" SEELE 05 哼了一声。

"It's…unexpected," Gendo answered cautiously, "apparently The Two doesn't know each other. Formerly we thought if The Two were Gods, they ought to be acquainted with each other well."
这……出乎意料，" 源堂谨慎地回答，"显然两位彼此并不认识。之前我们以为如果两位是神，他们应该彼此非常熟悉。

"Well reality tells you otherwise," SEELE 08 mocked, "anyway, keep a close eye on them. We don't want one of them dead because they can't tolerate each other."
但现实告诉你并非如此，" SEELE 08 嘲讽道，"无论如何，密切监视他们。我们不希望因为彼此无法容忍而导致其中一位丧命。

"Understood." Gendo replied, and the monoliths disappeared. "Rei," he started, "how's everything been going recently?"
明白了。" 源渡回答道，那些巨石随即消失。"绫波，" 他开口问道，"最近一切都还好吗？

Rei smiled a small smile, "everything is fine, papa. I've made a new friend in school today!"
绫波微微一笑，"一切都好，爸爸。今天在学校我交了一个新朋友！"

"Is that so? Who is it?"
是吗？她是谁？

"Her name is Hikari Horaki! The class representative," Rei said happily, "she's a nice person."
她叫光博子！是我们班的班长，" 绫波开心地说，"她人很好。

"Good to hear. You can go home now, I'll come back later."
听你这么说我就放心了。你现在可以回家了，我晚点再回来。

"Alright. See you, papa."
好的。再见，爸爸。

Asuka woke up with her panties soaked, still immersed in the after-effect of her wet dream. She had dreamed about all the dirty things Shinji was doing to her – although she knew it was a dream, she still wanted to fight back, however no matter how hard she tried, the whole scene just played in front of her eyes.
明日香醒来时，内裤已被浸湿，仍沉浸在春梦的余韵中。她梦见真嗣对她做的那些不堪之事——尽管明知是梦境，她仍想反抗，然而无论怎样挣扎，那场景依旧在眼前上演。

It felt real. 感觉很真实。

She had no way to know they were her memories - not that she's gonna believe them anyway.
她无从知晓这些是否是她的记忆——即便如此，她也不会相信。

'It's just me getting horny, and Shinji was like the only boy I know here,' she justified – although there was also Kaji. She found the idea of being intimate with Shinji was absurd. Nevertheless, she still thought Shinji was kind of cute. Not that she's going to admit it.
'只是我一时冲动，而真嗣是这里我唯一认识的男生，' 她这样为自己辩解——尽管还有加持先生。她觉得和真嗣亲密的想法很荒谬。尽管如此，她还是觉得真嗣有点可爱。当然，她不会承认这一点。

Getting up from the bed and changing into a clean set of undergarments, Asuka slid the door open, just to bump into a zombie-walking Misato.
从床上起身，换上一套干净的内衣，明日香拉开滑门，不巧正撞见梦游般的美里。

"Ahhhh!" Asuka screamed in a high pitch.
"啊——！"明日香尖声叫道。

"Arghhh!" Misato groaned in headache after hangover, palm rubbing forehead, "keep voice low! Oh god, my heads!" She then stumbled towards the bathroom,
"哎哟——！"宿醉后的美里头疼地呻吟着，手掌揉着额头，"小声点！天哪，我头好痛！"她随后踉跄地走向浴室，

"Gottverdammt…" Asuka murmured, walking to the fridge and grabbed a bowl of cereal. Both Misato and Asuka were too lazy to make any breakfast, so cereal and milk would suffice.
"该死的……"明日香嘟囔着，走向冰箱，拿出一碗麦片。美里和明日香都懒得做早餐，所以麦片和牛奶就够了。

Sitting down at the table, Asuka immersed in her thoughts. 'Do I really need to apologize? I guess I do, since there's no way I could get rid of him completely…just make it a working relationship, and all will be good.' "So, Asuka!" Her train of thought was interrupted by Misato's voice, "have you decided?" Although it was a question, the glare she gave her wasn't compromising one.
坐到桌前，明日香沉浸在自己的思绪中。'我真的需要道歉吗？我想是的，毕竟我无法完全摆脱他……就保持工作关系吧，一切都会好的。' "那么，明日香！"她的思绪被美里的声音打断，"你决定了吗？"虽然是个问句，但美里投来的目光却毫不妥协。

Asuka sighed, "Yeah, I will apologize." 'But I said 'Don't come near me ever again'…if I simply go and apologize, this will make me look like a hypocrite…and a pitiful one. I hate pity.' "But… I'll apologize when time and surroundings are appropriate."
明日香叹了口气，“嗯，我会道歉的。”“但我之前说过‘别再靠近我’……如果我就这么去道歉，会显得我很虚伪……还很可怜。我讨厌被同情。”“不过……我会找个合适的时机和环境去道歉的。”

"I'll keep your words," Misato smiled, then turned into a devilish one, "I mean, he's pretty cute, you know…"
“我会记住你的话，”美里笑着，随即露出狡黠的神情，“我是说，他挺可爱的，你知道的……”

Asuka raised an eyebrow, "what are you talking about?"
明日香挑了挑眉，“你在说什么呢？”

"Just saying, you could use one or two or a few boyfriends here…" Misato winked, using that voice, "I saw how you looked at his butt yesterday when you thought no one was looking…"
“只是说说而已，你这里或许需要一两个，或者几个男朋友……”美里眨了眨眼，用那种语调说道，“我昨天看到你偷瞄他的屁股，当时你还以为没人注意到呢……”

"Pervert! Hentai! Unbelievable!" Asuka blushed as red as her hair, "as if I'm interested in boys! Especially not that wimpy little pervert, unless it's the end of the world!"
变态！色狼！难以置信！" 明日香的脸红得跟她的头发一样，"好像我会对男生感兴趣似的！尤其是那个懦弱的小变态，除非世界末日！

"So he's got a chance, after all…" Misato showed a sly smile, "Say it to him, I bet he'll actually end the world just for you…"
这么说，他还是有机会的嘛……" 美里露出一抹狡黠的笑容，"你跟他说说看，我打赌他真会为了你把世界终结掉……

"Argh! You're so immature!" Asuka growled, "I don't even know what Kaji as mature as him saw in you!"
啊！你真幼稚！" 明日香咆哮道，"我真不知道像加持那样成熟的人看上你哪一点了！

Misato choked, "Listen you brat…I want nothing to do with that jerk!"
美里一时语塞，"听着，你这小鬼……我可不想跟那个混蛋扯上任何关系！"

"Hmph, is that so? The way you deny it says otherwise!" Asuka grinned slyly, tasting the small victory.
"哼，是吗？你否认的样子可不像哦！" 明日香狡黠地笑了，品味着这小小的胜利。

Misato mumbled something incoherent and focused on her meal, ignoring Asuka's further teasing comments.
美里含糊地嘟囔了几句，便专注于自己的餐食，对明日香的进一步调侃置若罔闻。

Shinji had another…insightful talk with his amicable prophesier last night.
真嗣昨晚又与那位友善的预言家进行了一次……富有洞见的交谈。

"Hello, Shinji. It's me, again. The prophesier." The cloaked figure appeared in front of him.
"你好，真嗣。又是我，那个预言者。" 披着斗篷的身影出现在他面前。

"Hi…It was a long day…"
嗨……今天真是漫长……

"Hmmm…let me see," the prophesier said, "Indeed. You've been through a lot today. Do you have any…questions?"
嗯……让我看看，" 预言者说道，"确实。你今天经历了不少。你有什么……问题吗？

"Of course!" Shinji said loudly, "what's wrong with the girl you asked me to…approach?"
当然有！" 真嗣大声说道，"你让我接近的那个女孩，她到底怎么了？

"Errr… she's not…exactly the easiest person to deal with," the prophesier said nervously, "Ouch! Asu-darling, it hurts!"
呃…她可不是…那种容易相处的人，"预言者紧张地说道，"哎哟！阿苏小可爱，你弄疼我了！

Shinji was very confused by the prophesier's behavior, "what's wrong?"
真嗣对预言者的行为感到非常困惑，"怎么了？"

"No-nothing!" the prophesier said, eliciting a frown on Shinji's face; he didn't expect a GOD to be…embarrassed?
"没-没什么！"预言者说，这让真嗣皱起了眉头；他没想到一个神明会…感到尴尬？

Nevertheless, Shinji continued, "Yeah, 'not exactly the easiest person' my ass! She'd already tried to kill me twice! Although she looks cute, she's a total-"
尽管如此，真嗣还是继续说道，"是啊，'不是那种容易相处的人'，真是说得好听！她都已经试图杀我两次了！虽然外表可爱，但她完全是个-"

The prophesier interrupted and swallowed HEAVILY, "okay okay I get it!" he almost sounded afraid of something, "now, get to business! So, she…became violent with you today, right? Do you have any idea why?"
预言家打断话头，重重地咽了口唾沫，“好了好了，我明白了！”他的声音几乎带着一丝恐惧，“现在，谈正事吧！所以，她今天对你动粗了，对吗？你有没有想过为什么？”

"Yeah, she thought I had something to do with her loss of virginity," Shinji replied, "how does it have anything to do with me, though? As if I'd risk my life…"
“嗯，她以为我跟她失去贞操的事有关，”真嗣回答道，“但这跟我有什么关系呢？我又怎么会拿自己的命去冒险…”

"Ouch!" the prophesier yelped in pain again, but Shinji had no idea why, "Okay…so, this may be a shock for you…but she's actually not wrong."
“哎哟！”预言家再次痛呼出声，但真嗣不明白原因，“好吧…这么说可能会让你震惊…但她其实并没有错。”

"Wha-wha-wha-what?" Shinji stammered, dumbstruck, "M-m-me?"
“什…什…什…什么？”真嗣结结巴巴，目瞪口呆，“我…我…我？”

"Yes, you! You're indeed the one who took her virginity. It's just both of you don't remember," the prophesier said.
"没错，就是你！你确实是夺走她初夜的人。只是你们俩都不记得了。"预言者说道。

"Wha-what? W-why?" 什、什么？为、为什么？

"Because you two were in a relationship!"
因为你们俩曾经是一对！

"Oh. H-how? I doubt…oh, we were EVA pilots."
哦。怎、怎么可能？我怀疑……哦，我们曾是 EVA 驾驶员。

"Exactly, but not totally correct. There were much more to your relationship - it wasn't simply because you were both EVA pilots and it was 'convenient', it was something more beautiful, like a poem depicting the first shine of sunrise, like…"
确实，但并不完全正确。你们之间的关系远不止于此——不仅仅因为你们都是 EVA 驾驶员，所以‘方便’，而是有更美好的东西，就像一首描绘日出第一缕光芒的诗，就像……

"Okay I get it, we were…intimate," Shinji sweatdropped, still baffled by the fact that he somehow captured the red dragon without dying in the process, "Is this why you ask me to…approach her again?"
好吧，我明白了，我们曾经……很亲密，" 真嗣尴尬地流汗，仍然困惑于自己如何在未丧命的情况下捕获了那只红龙，"这就是你让我再次接近她的原因吗？

"Yeah, mainly because of it…"
是的，主要是因为这个……

"But why don't you tell her all this? Why me and me only?"
但为什么你不直接告诉她这一切？为什么只让我去说？

"Because… she's not gonna believe it, although she might still kill you, in the current situation," the prophesier replied with an uneasy voice, seemingly bracing for an imminent attack, "unlike you, I know you well, you'll simply accept it after the initial shock."
因为…她不会相信的，尽管在当前情况下她可能还是会杀了你，"预言者不安地回答，仿佛在为即将到来的攻击做准备，"和你不同，我了解你，你会在最初的震惊后简单接受这一切。

"Well, I guess you're not wrong…" Shinji said smiling. "How did I…get together with her, then?"
嗯，我想你说的没错…" 真嗣微笑着说，"那我是怎么…和她走到一起的呢？

"I can't really tell you details for now…but one thing you need to know. Always react – don't run away. Whenever she yells at or insults you, you need to push back – not insult back, but you can't stay down. She'll respect you much more this way."
我现在还不能告诉你具体细节…但有一点你必须知道。要始终回应——不要逃避。每当她对你大吼或辱骂时，你得反击——不是回骂，而是不能屈服。这样她会更加尊重你。

"I'll try," Shinji said after a long silence, "I'm not very good at…these sorts of things."
我会试试，"真嗣在长时间的沉默后说，"我不太擅长…这类事情。

"People change, Shinji. Alright, time is almost up…good luck."
人都是会变的，真嗣。好了，时间差不多了…祝你好运。

"Will I see you tomorrow?"
明天还能见到你吗？

"Maybe, it depends." The prophesier answered, "but we'll definitely meet again. See you, Shinji."
或许吧，看情况。" 预言者回答道，"但我们肯定会再见的。再见，真嗣。

Shinji shook his head again, picking up his pace to the school. In retrospect, he was kind of happy to learn that he actually had a chance with the pretty yet temperamental redhead, but he was also scared of the process. His heart sank as he remembered Asuka's last words to him yesterday, 'Don't come near me ever again,' she said. It was a downright rejection – although he didn't exactly ask her out on a date.
真嗣再次摇了摇头，加快脚步向学校走去。回想起来，得知自己竟然有机会追求那位既美丽又脾气火爆的红发女孩，他心里有些窃喜，但同时也感到害怕。想起昨天明日香对他说的最后一句话，他的心沉了下去，"别再靠近我，"她说。这无疑是彻底的拒绝——尽管他并没有明确提出约会。

He couldn't face her yet, but they went to the same school and work at the same place; they can't really – physically - get rid of each other. And Shinji was dreading about school – they sat next to each other, after all.
他还无法面对她，但他们就读于同一所学校，又在同一个地方工作；他们实际上——物理上——无法摆脱彼此。而且，真嗣对学校感到恐惧——毕竟他们坐在一起。

Maybe he could begin his fraternization with Toji and Kensuke. That would be a perfect distraction from the redhead.
或许他可以开始与东治和健介建立友谊。那将是远离那位红发女孩的完美分心之举。

At the moment, Earth Orbit
此刻，地球轨道上

"Shin-chan, any last words?" the God Asuka said as sweetly as possible, grinning devilishly, cracking her knuckles.
"新之助，还有什么遗言吗？"女神明日香尽可能甜甜地说道，邪恶地咧嘴笑着，活动着手指关节。

The God Shinji chuckled nervously, "Asuka, you know I don't think you like that."
神之真嗣紧张地笑了笑，"明日香，你知道我不认为你喜欢那样。"

"Hmph…but he IS you, and now I finally get to know your first impression of me…" the God Asuka huffed, her voice suddenly sorrowful, "I guess your counterpart does have a point…even me seeing myself acting like this is making me uncomfortable…man, I really was abrasive and arrogant, wasn't I?"
哼……但他确实是你，现在我终于能知道你对我的第一印象了……"女神明日香哼了一声，声音突然变得悲伤，"我想你的分身说得有道理……连我自己看到自己这样都感到不舒服……天哪，我那时真是尖锐又傲慢，不是吗？

"Well, I wouldn't say that…" the God Shinji comforted, "but it's all in the past…and I understand why you were like that, you had a…rough childhood. You just deal with it differently than me. I mean, I still love you, no matter what."
嗯，我倒不会这么说……"神之真嗣安慰道，"但那都是过去的事了……我理解你为什么会那样，你的童年……很艰难。你只是处理方式和我不同。我的意思是，无论怎样，我依然爱你。

The God Asuka smiled, "Hmph, I'll forgive you…if you make me happy, right now."
神明明日香微笑着说：“哼，我就原谅你吧……只要你现在能让我开心。”

Fortunately, the God Shinji knew very well what to do at that time.
幸好，神明真嗣非常清楚那时该做什么。

XXXXXXXXXXX

Shinji sat uncomfortably on the chair; he felt like melting under Asuka's soul-piercing glare. He had briefly thought about swapping his seat to the far corner, but it was already occupied by someone – she was just absent yesterday, and apparently Sensei prepared the two seats so that they could sit next to each other. They didn't know it was Fuyutsuki who demanded it.
真嗣尴尬地坐在椅子上，感觉自己仿佛要被明日香那穿透灵魂的目光融化。他曾短暂考虑过换到角落的座位，但那里已经有人了——她只是昨天没来，显然老师安排了这两个座位，让他们可以坐在一起。他们不知道这是冬月要求的。

Asuka was still deciding how and when to apologize. Seeing Shinji wanted nothing more than digging a hole in the ground and vanish, Asuka simultaneously felt bad and powerful. She retracted her glare, giving poor Shinji a break.
明日香还在犹豫如何及何时道歉。看到真嗣恨不得挖个地洞消失的样子，明日香既感到内疚又有些得意。她收回了锐利的目光，给可怜的真嗣一个喘息的机会。

Shinji sighed in relief as Asuka turned her attention to her laptop. He figured he could use it to spend his time as well. Opening his laptop, Shinji found himself receiving loads of messages from his classmates. Most of them were about his relationship with the redhead. He discarded those without a second thought – except one person.
随着明日香将注意力转向她的笔记本电脑，真嗣松了一口气。他想，自己也可以用电脑来打发时间。打开自己的笔记本，真嗣发现自己收到了许多同学发来的消息。大多数都是关于他和那位红发女孩的关系。他毫不犹豫地忽略了这些消息——除了一个人的。

Kensuke A.: Hello, Shikinami-kun! May I ask what your relationship with Shikinami-san is?
洞木光：你好，真嗣君！请问你和明日香小姐是什么关系？

Shinji smiled. This could be a perfect chance to befriend him.
真嗣微微一笑。这或许是个与他交友的绝佳机会。

Shinji S.: Hello, Aida-kun! We have a complicated relationship. I don't even understand it myself. At least I can tell you that we work together.
真嗣 S.: 你好，相田君！我们的关系挺复杂的。我自己也搞不清楚。至少我能告诉你，我们是同事。

Technically he was telling the truth. After a few seconds, he received a reply.
从技术上讲，他说的没错。几秒钟后，他收到了回复。

Kensuke A.: Cool! You work? Where?
健介 A.: 酷！你工作了？在哪儿？

Shinji had pondered about whether to tell him the truth, he figured if NERV had no problem with him saying he was a pilot, then it shouldn't be any different here.
真嗣曾犹豫是否该告诉他真相，他觉得既然 NERV 不介意他说自己是驾驶员，那么在这里说出来应该也没什么不同。

Shinji S.: I work at Gehirn. You know what that is, right?
真嗣 S.: 我在 Gehirn 工作。你知道那是什么，对吧？

He could hear a gasp from Kensuke, who sat two rows in front of him, and was looking back at him with an unbelievable look.
他听到坐在前面两排的健介倒吸一口凉气，正用难以置信的眼神回头看着他。

Kensuke A.: Of course I know! It's well known for building this wonderful city and cutting-edge technologies! Man, I do envy you! Could you please tell me more about Gehirn?
健介 A.: 当然知道！它以建造这座美妙的城市和尖端技术而闻名！天哪，我真羡慕你！能多给我讲讲 Gehirn 吗？

Shinji S.: I guess…how about we have lunch together?
真嗣 S.: 我想想……要不我们一起去吃午饭？

Shinji could literally hear Kensuke shout "Yes!", drawing everybody's attention in the classroom to him. Even Asuka raised her head and showed a confused expression, before diving back into the manga she was reading. Kensuke frantically looked around and was instantly embarrassed, his face red.
真嗣几乎能听到剑介大喊“耶！”的声音，将教室里所有人的注意力都吸引到了他身上。就连明日香也抬起头，露出一脸困惑的表情，随后又埋头继续看她的漫画。剑介慌张地环顾四周，顿时感到尴尬，脸涨得通红。

Shinji sighed. 真嗣叹了口气。

XXXXXXXXXXX

The lunch bell rang, Kensuke practically jumped out of his seat and rushed to Shinji's desk, a promising look on his face. Just as Shinji was about to take out the bento he made and go with Kensuke, he was interrupted by a voice, "Hey, Baka, where can I have lunch?"
午餐铃声响起，剑介几乎是跳出了座位，急匆匆地冲到真嗣的桌前，脸上带着期待的表情。正当真嗣准备拿出自己做的便当，打算和剑介一起去吃时，却被一个声音打断了，“喂，笨蛋，我在哪儿能吃午饭？”

Shinji was frozen in the spot. He wanted to run. He wanted to run away so badly that it physically hurt. He didn't know why Asuka would talk to him, not after yesterday's incident. However, a small part of him was saying "Don't forget your promise to the prophesier!", so he swallowed and turned around slowly, "Hmmm, the cafeteria is on the first floor." Suddenly he grew curious, "did you not eat yesterday?"
真嗣僵立在原地，他想要逃跑，他如此渴望逃离，以至于身体都感到疼痛。他不明白明日香为何还会跟他说话，尤其是在昨天的那件事之后。然而，内心深处有个声音在提醒他：“别忘了你对预言者的承诺！”于是，他咽了口唾沫，缓缓转过身，“嗯，食堂在一楼。”他突然好奇起来，“你昨天没吃东西吗？”

Asuka narrowed her eyes, and Shinji almost regrated asking the follow-up question. However instead of a cold shoulder or an angry retort, she simply said, "Well, I had Misato's cooking yesterday, and I'm not eating those biochemical weapons ever again!" Shinji couldn't help but chuckle, feeling bad for the redhead.
明日香眯起了眼睛，真嗣几乎后悔问出那个问题。然而，她并没有给他冷脸或愤怒的反驳，只是淡淡地说：“昨天吃了美里做的饭，我再也不想吃那些生化武器了！”真嗣忍不住轻笑出声，对这位红发少女心生同情。

Asuka actually wanted him to come along with her so that she could apologize, nothing more. "So, you coming with me?"
明日香其实只是想让他陪她一起去，以便能道歉，别无他意。“所以，你要跟我一起去吗？”

Shinji couldn't believe what he thought he heard. It seemed like she was sending some hidden message, but it went over his head. "Hmm, I actually make my own bentos," saying, he took out the bento box from his schoolbag, showing it to the redhead, "and I'm eating with Aida-kun today."
真嗣不敢相信自己所听到的。他感觉她似乎在传达某种隐秘的信息，但他却未能领会。“嗯，我自己带了便当，”说着，他从书包里拿出便当盒，向红发少女展示，“今天我要和剑介一起吃。”

"Oh." Asuka didn't know what she should do. She summoned all her willpower to ask him to go to the cafeteria with her, an opportunity the boys in the class would fight for, and he just took out his bento and rejected her outright. Maybe he was as dense as a neutron star, but that didn't matter. However, apart from her simmering anger, she was still curious about how in the world a boy could make his own bentos. "Suit yourself." She said, just a little venomous, and left the classroom.
"哦。"明日香不知道自己该怎么办。她鼓起所有的勇气邀请他一起去食堂，这是班上男生们争抢的机会，而他却拿出自己的便当，直接拒绝了。也许他迟钝得像中子星一样，但这并不重要。然而，除了她那沸腾的怒气外，她还是对一个男生怎么能自己做便当感到好奇。"随你便。"她带着一丝毒意说道，然后离开了教室。

Shinji suddenly felt he did something wrong, but he shook it off. Asuka talking to him, asking him, was already much more than he had ever expected. Sighing, he turned his attention to Kensuke, who had a bento made by his father in his hand. "Let's go then."
真嗣突然觉得自己做错了什么，但他摇了摇头。明日香主动和他说话，询问他，这已经超出了他的预期。叹了口气，他转向手拿父亲做的便当的剑介。"那我们走吧。"

"Great! Hmmm, may I ask someone else to come with us? He's my best friend!" Kensuke asked.
"太好了！嗯，我可以再邀请一个人一起来吗？他是我最好的朋友！"剑介问道。

"What's his name?" Shinji could already guess, though.
"他叫什么名字？"真嗣心里其实已经有数了。

"Toji Suzuhara." Yep. It's him. "No problem."
碇真嗣。" 没错，就是他。"没问题。

The trio climbed to the roof and found a quiet spot. "So, new kid," Toji started, breaking the silence, "Wass' the deal between you and red? Ya seem close, but…"
三人爬上屋顶，找了个僻静的地方。"那么，新来的，" 东治打破了沉默，"你和那个红发女孩之间是怎么回事？看起来挺亲近的，但是……"

Shinji sighed, once again cursing internally about his bad choice of surname, "Why everybody is interested in our relationship? We just work together, that's all."
真嗣叹了口气，再次在心里咒骂自己糟糕的姓氏选择，"为什么大家都对我们俩的关系这么感兴趣？我们只是在一起工作而已，仅此而已。"

"Well, she's foreign! And she has a Japanese family name, and it happens to be the same as yours!" Toji explained, "I mean, just think about it, man!"
哎，她是外国人！而且她有个日本姓氏，还恰好和你的一样！" 东治解释道，"我是说，你想想看，伙计！

"I guess you're right…" Shinji's palm met his face, "but we're not married… it's…complicated."
我想你说的没错…" 真嗣的手掌贴在脸上，"但我们还没结婚…这事儿…挺复杂的。

"Well then, if you're not…can I ask her out on a date?" Kensuke said half-mockingly.
"那既然你们不是…我能约她出去吗？" 健介半开玩笑地说。

For some reason, Shinji wasn't even offended – in fact, he was about to laugh at the very idea of going on a date with the Red Devil. He successfully suppressed it into a chuckle, "If you'd survive the first hour…"
不知为何，真嗣并未感到冒犯——实际上，他差点因为和红魔女约会的想法笑出声来。他勉强将其压成一声轻笑，"如果你能撑过第一个小时的话…"

"What does that mean?" Toji asked, sounding curious.
"这话什么意思？" 东治好奇地问道。

"She's…too much to handle, I guess." Bad choice of words, but not too far from the truth – just in the other direction.
"她实在是…难以应付，我想。" 话说得不太妥当，但也不算太离谱——只是方向反了。

Having perverted minds, Toji and Kensuke misunderstood his words as a double entendre, and their faces immediately blushed light pink, "wha-what're you implying by that?"
由于心怀不轨，东治和健介将他的话误解为双关语，两人的脸颊立刻泛起浅浅的粉红，"你这话…是什么意思？"

Shinji raised an eyebrow, "What?" He asked innocently.
真嗣挑了挑眉，"什么？" 他无辜地问道。

Toji swallowed, "are you two… sleepin' together?"
东治咽了口唾沫，"你们俩…是不是一起睡了？"

"WHAT?!" Shinji exclaimed, "wh-where does that come from?" 'Do they know? No…impossible!'
"什么?!" 真嗣惊呼道，"这...这是从哪冒出来的？" '他们知道了？不...不可能！'

"You literally said… she's too much to handle!" Kensuke said with bafflement across his face, "that…implies something!"
你刚才明明说...她太难对付了！" 健介满脸困惑地说，"这...这暗示着什么啊！

"Oh," Shinji thought about it and found him right, "but that's not what I meant!" He blushed HARD as he remembered what the prophesier said, fantasizing what it would feel like…
"哦，" 真嗣想了想，发现他说得没错，"但我不是那个意思！" 他脸红得厉害，回想起预言者的话，幻想着那会是什么感觉...

"C'mon, Shikinami-kun! You're all red!" Toji mocked, "what does it feel like? Is she…"
得了吧，四郎！你脸都红透了！" 东治调侃道，"那感觉怎么样？她是不是...

"Just drop it, alright?!" Shinji cut him off forcefully, "any of our conversations gets in her ear and I'll be a DEAD man! And what about Gehirn stuff you were asking about? Let's talk about that, okay?"
就别提了，行不行？！" 真嗣断然打断他，"我们任何对话要是传到她耳朵里，我就死定了！还有你之前问的关于 Gehirn 的事呢？咱们聊聊那个，好吗？

"Sure, sure, Shikinami-kun," Kensuke finally remembered the whole purpose of the lunch and wasted no time. "So…what do you guys do, exactly?"
当然，当然，式波君，" 健介终于记起午餐的真正目的，毫不迟疑地问，"那么……你们具体是做什么的？

"First, just call me Shinji, alright?"
首先，直接叫我真嗣，行吗？

"Sure, and you can call me Kensuke."
好的，你也可以叫我健介。

"Call me Toji, Shin-man!"
叫我冬二，真嗣兄！

"Great!" Shinji smiled happily as he finally accomplished his goal, "So I guess we're friends now, huh?"
太好了！" 真嗣开心地笑了，终于达成了目标，"那我们现在算是朋友了吧？

XXXXXXXXXXX

Asuka was irritated. She usually didn't need a reason to get irritated, but this time she had a very specific reason, and it had a name. 'Just what's wrong with that idiot?' she thought angrily, 'but I guess after what I said to him… it's understandable.' She entered the cafeteria and found it sold nothing but junk food. She grumbled in frustration. 'Misato's cooking is awful…cafeteria sells junk food…and that IDIOT makes his OWN bentos! Argh!'
明日香感到烦躁。她通常不需要理由就会烦躁，但这次她有一个非常具体的原因，而且这个原因有个名字。'那个白痴到底怎么了？' 她愤怒地想，'不过考虑到我对他说的话……也能理解。' 她走进食堂，发现那里只卖垃圾食品。她懊恼地嘟囔着。'美里做的饭难吃……食堂卖垃圾食品……那个白痴还自己带便当！啊！'

She entered the line and waited. Asuka looked in front of her – the person standing there had long brown hair and pink glasses, and her butt – put it in this way, Asuka had NEVER felt envious toward any girls around her age because they were hotter than her, until now. So, she felt compelled to know her. Asuka tapped her shoulder and spoke, "Hm, hello?"
她排进队伍，开始等待。明日香向前望去——站在她前面的人有着一头长长的棕色秀发和粉色的眼镜，至于她的臀部——这么说吧，明日香从未因为同龄女孩比自己更火辣而感到嫉妒，直到此刻。因此，她不由得想要认识对方。明日香轻拍她的肩膀，开口道：“呃，你好？”

The person turned around – she had brilliant blue eyes and twin ponytails just like her, although her breasts were also larger. Not that Asuka's weren't large, though. She didn't look Japanese, either. "Yes?" she then focused her eyes on Asuka and smiled, "oh, you're the transfer student, aren't you? I'm Mari Makinami, nice to meet ya!"
那人转过身来——她有着一双明亮的蓝眼睛，双马尾的发型与明日香如出一辙，尽管她的胸部也更为丰满。倒不是说明日香的就不大。她看起来也不像日本人。“什么事？”她将目光聚焦在明日香身上，微笑着说：“哦，你就是那个转学生吧？我是真希波·玛丽·伊兰崔亚斯，很高兴认识你！”

"Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, too." Asuka was surprised at her enthusiasm, "I'm Asuka, Asuka Shikinami!" She paused for a second, peeking out her head to the counter, "so…do you know what they serve here is…edible?"
“嗯，嗯。我也很高兴认识你。”明日香对她的热情感到惊讶，“我是明日香，式波·明日香·兰格雷！”她停顿了一下，探头望向柜台，“那么……你知道这里卖的东西……能吃吗？”

"Aw, picky on food, like a princess…" Mari joked, and Asuka pouted, "anyway, the burger here is not that bad…and you can always make your own food at home, ya know?"
“哎呀，对食物这么挑剔，像个公主似的……”玛丽打趣道，明日香则撅起了嘴，“不管怎样，这里的汉堡其实还不错……而且你也可以在家自己做吃的，知道吗？”

"I guess…but I don't have anyone to cook for me, and neither can I cook," Asuka sighed, "Misato's such a slob…"
我想……但我没人给我做饭，我自己也不会做，" 明日香叹了口气，"美里真是邋遢……

"Wait, you know Misato?" Mari raised an eyebrow.
"等等，你认识美里？" 玛丽挑了挑眉。

"Yeah, she's my guardian. What's wrong?"
对，她是我的监护人。有什么问题吗？

"Well, ain't that interesting…" Mari murmured, "so, I guess you know what Gehirn is, right?"
嗯，这倒挺有意思的……" 玛丽低声说道，"那么，我想你应该知道 Gehirn 是什么吧？

"Of course! I work there, after all." Asuka said proudly, "Judging from your expression, you work there as well?"
当然！我毕竟在那里工作。" 明日香自豪地说，"看你的表情，你也在那里工作吧？

Mari quickly composed herself, "yeah… what's your position?"
真希波迅速恢复镇定，"嗯……你担任什么职位？"

"They call it human-computer neural link interactions or something like that," Asuka replied, "how about you?"
他们称之为人机神经链接交互之类的，" 明日香回答，"你呢？

"I was Misato's intern secretary," Mari answered, "and it was fun!"
我是美里小姐的实习秘书，" 真希波答道，"挺有趣的！

"Wait, just how old are you?"
等等，你到底多大了？

"I'm sixteen." 我十六岁。

"Oh, I'm only fourteen…no wonder you have big boobs and butts…" Asuka muttered, but not unnoticed by Mari, "aw, princess, are you jealous of my figures?" She said with a wink.
"哦，我才十四岁…难怪你有那么大的胸部和臀部…" 明日香嘀咕道，但没逃过玛丽的耳朵，"哎呀，公主，你是在羡慕我的身材吗？" 她眨眼说道。

"Shut it, four-eyes!" Asuka shot back, "mine is just good enough!"
闭嘴，四眼妹！" 明日香反击道，"我的已经够好了！

They picked up their food and found an empty table. Asuka was feeling strangely generous today, so she didn't mind when Mari asked if she could eat with her. They then talked about other stuff – stuff that girls liked to talk about. The sun shot through the window onto the golden mane of Asuka, shining like a swirl of fire.
她们取了食物，找到一张空桌坐下。今日的明日香出奇地大方，当真希波询问是否可以一同进餐时，她并未介意。随后，两人聊起了其他话题——那些女孩们喜欢谈论的事情。阳光透过窗户洒在明日香金色的秀发上，闪耀如一团燃烧的火焰。

"So," Mari started, "got any boyfriends yet?"
“那么，”真希波开口道，“有男朋友了吗？”

"No. Not that I'm interested in boys, anyway." It was the truth. "What, are you interested in me?" Asuka mocked.
“没有。反正我对男生也没兴趣。”这是实话。“怎么，你对我有意思？”明日香戏谑地反问。

"No, perish the thought!" Mari replied hastily, "actually, it's worth a try…" she winked.
“不不，绝无此意！”真希波急忙回应，“不过，试试也无妨…”她眨了眨眼。

Asuka showed a fake disgusted face, "Ewww, but I'm straight!" Although she didn't want to admit it, she was flattered that her figure could even attract girls.
明日香装出一副假惺惺的厌恶表情，“噫，可我是直的！”尽管她不愿承认，但能吸引到女孩子的目光，内心还是有些窃喜。

"Yeah, from what I've heard, you indeed do not have a boyfriend…" Mari paused, and Asuka sighed in relief, "but a husband."
“是啊，听闻你确实没有男朋友……”玛丽停顿了一下，明日香刚松了口气，她又接着说，“但有丈夫。”

Asuka choked on her food, fortunately she wasn't drinking anything otherwise she would've spilled the liquid – preferably onto Mari's face. "WHAT?!"
明日香被食物噎住了，幸好没在喝水，否则准会喷出来——最好喷在玛丽脸上。“什么？！”

"Aw, everybody knows…" Mari teased, "The Shikinamis! Lovey-dovey couple! Running out of the classroom the first class, living in sin!"
“哎呀，大家都知道的……”玛丽打趣道，“式波家那对！恩爱夫妻！一下课就冲出教室，过着罪恶的生活！”

"Listen, four-eyes!" Asuka sounded serious and irritated, "THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US!"
听着，四眼！"明日香语气严肃而恼怒，"我们之间什么都没有！

"I'm sure there's nothing between you!" Mari grinned devilishly, "no daylight, no air gaps…nothing but sweet! Awwwww!"
我确信你们之间啥也没有！"玛丽狡黠地咧嘴笑道，"没有空隙，没有空气……只有甜蜜！哎呀呀！

Asuka just gave up, knowing there wouldn't be an end to this if she kept arguing. What's worse, they were drawing a lot of attention – she couldn't afford more people learning about this ridiculous rumor.
明日香放弃了，知道如果继续争论下去也不会有结果。更糟糕的是，他们已经引起了太多注意——她可承受不起更多人知道这个荒谬的谣言。

XXXXXXXXXXX

After the friendly lunch period with Mari, Asuka went back to the classroom, finding Shinji already present. As soon as he saw her, he flinched and averted his eyes. Asuka growled in annoyance – she just wanted to get this done, but Shinji was making it difficult. She couldn't really blame him for it; she was the one who said those harsh words, after all. Maybe Shinji wanted nothing to do with her anymore – for some unknown reason, the very thought of Shinji completely gone from her life made her stomach twitch.
与玛丽共度的友好午餐时间结束后，明日香回到教室，发现真嗣已经在了。他一看到她，就紧张地移开了视线。明日香恼怒地低吼一声——她只是想把事情解决，但真嗣却让这变得困难。她不能真的怪他；毕竟那些尖刻的话是她说的。也许真嗣再也不想和她有任何瓜葛了——不知为何，一想到真嗣彻底从她的生活中消失，她的胃就一阵抽搐。

Usually, her pride would prevent her from apologizing under this situation. She asked him to come with her, and it was him who rejected – it felt like a humiliation to chase after him and apologize, much less in front of the whole class!
通常，她的自尊心会阻止她在这种情况下道歉。是她让他跟她一起去的，而他拒绝了——追着他道歉，更不用说在全班面前，感觉就像是一种羞辱！

Two antagonizing ideas conflicted in her mind, Asuka didn't know what to do anymore. Damn, the Great Asuka Langley Soryu was NEVER indecisive!
两种对立的想法在她的脑海中冲突，明日香不知道该怎么办了。该死，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不优柔寡断！

Finally, she decided to take a moderate approach. She went back to her seat, forcing herself to ignore Shinji all the way, and opened her laptop. Discarding all the date requests like she always did, she found Shinji S. in the contact list, and clicked 'PM'.
最终，她决定采取一种折中的方式。她回到自己的座位，强迫自己一路上无视真嗣，然后打开了笔记本电脑。像往常一样，她将所有的约会请求置之不理，在联系人列表中找到了真嗣 S.，并点击了“私信”。

Asuka S.: Idiot, got a minute?
明日香 S.: 笨蛋，有空吗？

Shinji received the message and was confused. He looked to his left – Asuka was sitting there, looking at him intently, daring him to say anything. They could be literally called deskmates, but she still chose to send him a private message? Weird.
收到消息的碇真嗣感到困惑。他向左一看——明日香就坐在那里，正专注地盯着他，仿佛在挑衅他开口。他们明明可以算是同桌，她却还是选择发私信给他？真是奇怪。

Shinji shook it off; if she wanted to play a game, then so be it.
真嗣摇了摇头；如果她想玩游戏，那就随她吧。

Shinji S.: What do you want?
真嗣 S.: 你想干嘛？

He could sense Asuka tense up. She started typing furiously, and then deleted all of them, and started again. After a few minutes of back and forth, Shinji finally received the message.
他能感觉到明日香紧张起来。她开始疯狂地打字，然后又全部删除，重新开始。几番反复后，真嗣终于收到了消息。

Asuka S.: About yesterday. I was…irrational, okay? I shouldn't beat you up like that. And I take back my words. We need to work together, after all. I don't want to make it hard for both of us. Don't think beyond that! I'm doing this only for myself!
明日香 S.: 关于昨天的事，我……当时太冲动了，好吗？我不该那样打你。那些话我收回。毕竟我们还得合作，我不想让彼此都难堪。别想多了！我这么做只是为了自己！

Seeing the message, Shinji smiled, a huge weight was lifted from his shoulders. However he wasn't about to end the game yet.
看到这条消息，真嗣笑了，肩上的重担仿佛瞬间卸下。但他并不打算就此结束这场游戏。

Shinji S.: Is that an apology?
真嗣 S.: 这是在道歉吗？

Asuka stared at the screen for several seconds, then typed.
明日香盯着屏幕看了几秒，然后开始打字。

Asuka S.: Think whatever you want.
明日香 S.: 随你怎么想。

In fact, Shinji had already got much more from the redhead than he expected – he actually thought she would just ignore him all day; he wasn't sure what changed in her, but he didn't mind it. Just as he was about to close the chat window, he suddenly recalled what the prophesier had told him – 'Always react – don't run away. Whenever she yells at or insults you, you need to push back – not insult back, but you can't stay down. She'll respect you much more this way.' Nervous as he was, he still decided to try.
事实上，真嗣从这位红发女孩那里得到的已经远超预期——他本以为她会整天无视他；他不清楚她哪里变了，但并不介意。正当他准备关闭聊天窗口时，突然想起预言者曾告诫他的话——“永远要回应——别逃避。无论她何时对你大吼或侮辱，你都得反击——不是以侮辱回击，而是不能屈服。这样她会更加尊重你。”尽管紧张，他还是决定尝试。

Shinji S.: Apology accepted, then.
真嗣 S.: 那我接受你的道歉了。

Asuka shot him a death glare that melted his soul upon contact – before looking back at her laptop and started typing.
明日香用一个足以融化他灵魂的死亡凝视瞪了他一眼——随后转回笔记本电脑，开始打字。

Asuka S.: Don't push your luck.
明日香 S.: 别得寸进尺。

This chat room has been closed by: Asuka S.
本聊天室已被：明日香 S.关闭。

Shinji let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. Today wasn't half as bad as he thought it would be.
真嗣吐出了他未曾察觉自己一直憋着的那口气。今天并没有他预想的那么糟糕。

XXXXXXXXXXX

Today was supposed to be the first day for both Asuka and Shinji to actually participate in their tests. After the school, Shinji and Asuka exited the gate separately – Asuka got in the car first and chatted with Kaji, while Shinji came three minutes later. On the way to the GeoFront, Asuka paid zero attention to the boy at the back seat, neither was she chatting with Kaji anymore. She was immersed in her own thoughts.
今天本应是明日香和真嗣首次正式参与测试的日子。放学后，两人分别离开了学校——明日香先上了车，与加持闲聊，而真嗣则在三分钟后才出现。前往 GeoFront 的途中，明日香对后座的男孩视若无睹，也不再与加持交谈，她沉浸在自己的思绪中。

'I wonder what our job is like. Wearing a plug suit and sit in an entry plug sounds just like piloting an EVA, but there's no such thing here. Human-computer interactions? Simulators? Sounds interesting, but I'm sure not even near the fun of piloting EVAs. And that idiot…how dare he push back?! Damn it! But he may be not such a wimp I thought he was…'
不知道我们的任务会是什么样子。穿上插入栓服，坐在插入栓里，听起来就像是在驾驶 EVA，但这里并没有那种东西。人机交互？模拟器？听起来挺有意思，但肯定比不上驾驶 EVA 的乐趣。还有那个笨蛋……他怎么敢顶嘴？！可恶！但他可能并不像我想象的那么懦弱……

One hour later 一小时后

To Asuka's surprise, her plug suit was not much different from the one he wore to pilot Unit 02. It was covered in red, with black strips on the sides of the sleeves. She was content with the design of it. Even the design of neural connectors was the same.
令明日香惊讶的是，她的插入栓服与她驾驶二号机时所穿的并无太大差异。通体红色，袖子两侧带有黑色条纹。她对这设计颇为满意，甚至连神经连接器的设计也如出一辙。

Shinji's plug suit was a bit different from what he wore. It's a dark-blue color with black strips – he didn't look half-bad in it, but far from his original plug suit. Not that he minded what he looked like in the skin-tight suits.
真嗣的插入栓服与他之前所穿的略有不同，深蓝色搭配黑色条纹——他穿上倒也不赖，但远不及他原来的那套。不过，他对于紧身衣下的自己是什么模样并不在意。

It didn't help to keep Asuka from stealing glances at him. 'Not as scrawny as I thought…actually he's quite athletic…' Of course she had no idea that it was the result of EVA pilots' fitness training.
这并未阻止明日香不时偷瞄他一眼。'没想到他并不瘦弱……实际上还挺健壮的……'当然，她并不知道这是 EVA 驾驶员体能训练的结果。

They walked to the testing area in silence. The test chamber was much smaller than the EVA cages, and three octagonal columns stood in the chamber.' 00', '01', and '02' were printed on each of them respectively. Shinji was assigned 01, and Asuka 02, not much to their surprise.
他们默默地走向测试区。测试室比 EVA 的笼子小得多，室内矗立着三根八角形柱子，分别印有'00'、'01'和'02'。真嗣被分配到 01，明日香则是 02，这并未让他们感到意外。

They sat in their respective plugs and waited for instruction.
他们各自坐在插槽中，等待指令。

"So, let's get straight into business," Naoko's voice came through the channel, "we'll try to connect your brain with computers. At the time, you may feel nausea, giddiness, and see hallucinations. Don't worry, this won't have a physical effect on your body."
那么，我们直奔主题，"直子的声音通过频道传来，"我们将尝试将你的大脑与计算机连接。届时，你可能会感到恶心、眩晕，甚至出现幻觉。别担心，这不会对你的身体造成实质影响。

"Well ain't that reassuring," Asuka commented, but ignored by Naoko.
"这话听着真让人安心，"明日香评论道，但被直子无视了。

"Begin activation," Maya's voice sounded, "LCL insertion."
开始激活，"玛雅的声音响起，"注入 LCL。

The orange liquid began filling up the plugs, however neither Asuka nor Shinji showed any sign of panic – and they should. 'Weird,' Naoko's scientific mind thought, 'they have little reactions to us 'drowning' them with unknown liquid…unless they already know what it is…maybe these two really ARE formed from LCL- thus akin to Adam and Lilith.' Nonetheless, she still said, "don't worry, you can breathe normally once your lungs are filled with LCL." She turned her focus on her terminal, "Ibuki, what's the connection status?"
橙色液体开始充满插头，然而无论是明日香还是真嗣都没有表现出丝毫的恐慌——他们本应如此。“奇怪，”直子的科学头脑思考着，“他们对被未知液体‘淹没’几乎没有反应……除非他们已经知道这是什么……也许这两个人真的由 LCL 构成——因此与亚当和莉莉丝相似。”尽管如此，她还是说道：“别担心，一旦你们的肺部充满 LCL，就能正常呼吸了。”她将注意力转向终端，“伊吹，连接状态如何？”

"Abnormal, ma'am!" Maya exclaimed, "they've passed absolute borderline already!"
“异常，女士！”玛雅惊呼，“他们已经超过了绝对界限！”

Naoko couldn't help but grin widely. Not a single person had done that before – if you don't count Rei as human. Even she spent several months to pass the absolute borderline. "What's the status of the simulator?"
直子忍不住咧嘴大笑。以前从未有人做到过——如果不把零算作人类的话。即使是她，也花了好几个月才突破绝对界限。“模拟器的状态如何？”

"Connection established! Begin phase two!" Maya said, typing furiously on her keyboard.
“连接已建立！开始第二阶段！”玛雅说道，手指在键盘上飞速敲击。

Inside the plugs, Shinji and Asuka saw a kaleidoscope of colors around them. And when the world around them stabilized, they found themselves standing in the middle of a street. "What is this place?" Asuka said, "Hello? Is anyone here?"
在插入栓内，真嗣和明日香看到周围色彩斑斓，如同万花筒一般。当周围的世界稳定下来时，他们发现自己正站在一条街道中央。“这是什么地方？”明日香说道，“有人吗？喂？”

"Hmm, I'm here Asuka," Shinji replied nervously, and swallowed as Asuka shot him a glare, "no one asked you, Baka!"
“呃，我在呢，明日香，”真嗣紧张地回答，咽了口唾沫，因为明日香瞪了他一眼，“没人问你，笨蛋！”

"This is a simulated world, you are basically inside the RAM of Magi," Naoko's voice sounded in their heads, rather than in their ears, "what do you guys see?"
“这是一个模拟的世界，你们现在基本上是在 MAGI 的内存里，”赤木直子的声音在他们脑海中响起，而非耳边，“你们看到了什么？”

"Um, a street I don't recognize," Shinji answered, glancing around him.
“嗯，一条我不认识的街道，”真嗣回答，环顾四周。

"Good," Naoko said, "try to walk around and test the level of details of the world."
好的，"直子说，"试着四处走走，测试一下这个世界的细节水平。

Shinji and Asuka spent the next 10 minutes just walking around and examining the surroundings. Shinji simply touched the walls and trees and the ground with his hands, trying to feel the sensation, while Asuka had already smashed the windshields of two cars. Surprisingly the glass cracked just like how it should crack in the real world – Asuka was a bit amazed by the level of detail and the physics engine of this simulation.
接下来的十分钟里，真嗣和明日香只是四处走动，观察周围环境。真嗣只是用手触摸墙壁、树木和地面，试图感受那种触感，而明日香已经砸碎了两辆车的挡风玻璃。令人惊讶的是，玻璃碎裂的方式与现实世界中应该碎裂的方式完全一致——明日香对这个模拟的细节水平和物理引擎感到有些惊讶。

"Alright, that's enough for today," Naoko said, "we're cutting off connections now,"
好了，今天就到这里，"直子说，"我们现在要断开连接了。

"No! I'm just starting to have fun!" Asuka protested, but was ignored by Naoko. With another kaleidoscope of colors, they woke up in their plugs. "That's enough data for your first try. Come back the day after tomorrow, and we'll try something new. You can both change and go home." Naoko said, shutting down the comm channel.
"不！我才刚开始觉得好玩呢！"明日香抗议道，但被直子无视了。随着又一阵万花筒般的色彩变幻，他们醒在了自己的插入栓中。"第一次尝试的数据已经足够了。后天再来，我们会尝试新的东西。你们俩都可以换衣服回家了。"直子说完，关闭了通讯频道。

Gendo kept his unwavering expression as twelve black monoliths floated around him. "Hum, it looks like we have no doubts, then."
源渡保持着他那坚定不移的表情，十二块黑色巨碑环绕其周。“嗯，看来我们对此没有疑问了。”

"Indeed," SEELE 01 continued, "those two children were by far the only ones who succeeded in the connection with Magi – even Rei, the clone of Lilith, took several months to establish a stable connection."
“确实如此，”SEELE 01 继续说道，“那两个孩子是目前为止唯一成功与 MAGI 建立连接的——即便是莉莉丝的克隆体绫波，也花了数月时间才建立起稳定的连接。”

"Very well," SEELE 03 concluded, "we've found The Two – now it's time to plan the initiation of the Second Impact."
“很好，”SEELE 03 总结道，“我们已经找到了那两人——现在该计划启动第二次冲击了。”

"The Two still needs some time to familiarize with the equipment," SEELE 05 disagreed, "we have plenty of time. Several months of delay will do no harm to our scenario."

Misato had gently awakened Asuka when they returned to the apartment. They wandered upstairs and Asuka sat down at the kitchen table and whipped up something to eat before she went to bed, seeing as she had napped on the slow car ride – much to Misato's suffering - home, and she also gave Pen–Pen something to eat as well. Normally Asuka couldn't care less about the warm water penguin, however today she was feeling cheerful since the day had gone quite well.
回到公寓后，美里轻柔地唤醒了明日香。两人漫步上楼，明日香坐在餐桌旁，迅速做了些吃的才去睡觉，毕竟她在缓慢的车程中打了个盹——这让美里颇为受罪——回到家后，她还顺便给企鹅彭彭也准备了食物。平日里明日香对这只温水企鹅漠不关心，但今天她心情愉悦，因为一天下来颇为顺利。

Misato had just finished in the shower when she came out wearing a small top that barely held in her breasts and what looked like a pair of boxer briefs that were so well-fitting, they outlined everything underneath. "Hiya, Asuka!" Misato said, grabbing a beer, "I thought you were going to bed?"
美里刚洗完澡，穿着一件勉强裹住胸部的紧身小上衣和一条紧贴身形的平角内裤，轮廓分明。"嘿，明日香！"美里说着，抓起一瓶啤酒，"我还以为你要去睡觉了呢？"

"I was hungry…" Asuka looked up tiredly from her food, "Misato… do you know what clothes are?"
我饿了……"明日香疲惫地抬头看向食物，"美里……你知道什么是衣服吗？

"What, it's hot outside!" Misato said, frowning, "and what's the problem, anyway? You're not interested in girls, are you?" She finished with a wink.
"哎呀，外面热死了！" 葛城美里皱着眉头说，"话说回来，有什么问题吗？你该不会对女孩子没兴趣吧？" 她眨了眨眼，调侃道。

"Misato, it's 32°C outside and 20°C in here, I'd even call that comfortable!" Asuka deadpanned, "and I'm NOT interested in girls!"
葛城小姐，外面 32 度，这里才 20 度，我都觉得挺舒服的！" 明日香面无表情地回应，"还有，我对女孩子可没兴趣！

"Well, it's hot outside," Misato retorted, "yeah, and you're interested in woman I see!"
嗯，外面是挺热的，" 葛城美里反驳道，"是啊，看来你对女人挺感兴趣的嘛！

"Misato…do you think it's even legal for you to go outside like this?!" Asuka shot back, disgusted by the indecency of her guardian, "you're…as good as naked! Do you have no shame?!"
葛城……你穿成这样出门真的合法吗？！" 明日香反击道，对她监护人的不检点感到厌恶，"你这……跟裸着有什么区别！难道你一点羞耻心都没有吗？！

"Asuka, you pervert! I thought you said you aren't into girls! And you're looking?!" Misato joked, eliciting a blush from Asuka.
"明日香，你这个变态！不是说对女生没兴趣吗！还偷看？！" 美里打趣道，惹得明日香脸颊泛红。

"It's not like I had a choice!" Asuka shouted, "You're throwing it in my face!"
我又不是故意的！" 明日香喊道，"是你硬要在我面前晃！

"Don't sound so ungrateful, Asuka!" Misato said with a devilish smile, "Only very few people get to see me like this!"
别这么不知好歹，明日香！" 美里带着一丝邪魅的笑容说，"能见到我这样的，可是没几个人哦！

"What kinds of perverted hentai are into MILFs?!" Asuka shot back.
"那些变态的色情漫画里，到底是什么人喜欢熟女啊？！" 明日香反击道。

"Did you just call me a MILF?!" Misato shouted, eyes widen, face red due to embarrassment.
"你刚才是不是叫我 MILF?!" 美里大声喊道，眼睛瞪大，脸因尴尬而涨得通红。

"Did I stutter?!" 我说话结巴了吗?!

"Asuka, you're so mean!" Misato yelled, "I'm not old enough to be a MILF! I'm not even 30! I'm still 28!"
明日香，你太过分了！" 美里吼道，"我还没老到能当 MILF 呢！我连 30 岁都不到！我才 28 岁！

"Oh, that was so worth it!" Asuka laughed so hard she almost fell out of the chair. "Your reaction made my day! It's priceless!"
哦，真是太值了！" 明日香笑得前仰后合，差点从椅子上摔下来。"你的反应让我的日子都亮了！真是无价之宝！

"Asuka, that's not nice!" Misato shouted, leaning over threateningly.
"明日香，这样不好！" 美里厉声喝道，身体前倾，气势逼人。

"You tease me all the time, Misato, it's time for some payback!"
美里，你总是捉弄我，现在该轮到我反击了！

"Brat…So, you know we won't have work tomorrow, but you'll do something new the day after, right?" Misato calmed down.
"小鬼…所以，你知道我们明天不用工作，但后天会有新任务，对吧？" 美里平静下来。

"Yeah, I remember what Dr. Akagi told us earlier, and I'm not deaf."
嗯，我记得赤木博士之前跟我们说的，我还没聋呢。

Misato walked over to her purse and pulled something out of it, "Well, you'll need this to get in tomorrow." Misato handed her a new ID card. "You're new ID card, it finally came today."
碇真嗣走到她的包旁，从中取出某物，“嗯，你明天需要这个才能进去。”碇真嗣递给她一张新的身份证。“你的新身份证，今天终于到了。”

Asuka took the card and saw her picture on the front. "Oh look, a shitty picture of me! What the HELL is this lighting?! I look like a fucking ghost!"
明日香接过卡片，看到正面有自己的照片。“哦看，一张糟糕透顶的我！这他妈是什么光线？！我看起来像个鬼！”

"You still look cute, just relax." Misato sighed, "So, always have that with you, Asuka, otherwise you can't get into Gehirn."
“你还是那么可爱，放松点。”碇真嗣叹了口气，“所以，要一直带着它，明日香，否则你进不了 Gehirn。”

"For a secret organization, you take an awfully long time to make security cards," Asuka mocked, causing Misato to mutter something inaudible, "I've been here for FOUR DAYS! Do they make the cards by HANDs?"
“对于一个秘密组织来说，你们制作安全卡的时间也太长了，”明日香嘲讽道，让碇真嗣低声嘟囔了句听不清的话，“我都来了四天了！难道他们是手工制作卡片吗？”

"Well, yes, I think they do…"
嗯，是的，我想他们确实……

"WHAT?!" Asuka replied, completely dumbfounded.
"什么？！" 明日香回答道，完全愣住了。

"Just joking! Also, could you do me a favor, Asuka?" Misato asked with a promising look, one which indicates nothing good would come next.
"开个玩笑！还有，你能帮我个忙吗，明日香？" 美里带着一副意味深长的表情问道，那表情预示着接下来不会有什么好事。

"Why would I?" 我为什么要帮？

"Can you take this other card to Rei?" Misato handed over an identical card for Rei, ignoring her impoliteness, "Hers is expired, and I forgot to give it to her when we saw her. Can you drop it off to her later? We still have plenty of time till night. She lives in the southern section of town, from when this place was still called Hakone, and not Tokyo– 3. Don't worry, I'll have Section-2 watch over closely."
你能帮我把这张卡带给绫波吗？" 美里递给了一张与绫波相同的卡片，无视了她的无礼，"她的卡过期了，上次见她时我忘了给她。你晚些时候能帮她送去吗？离晚上还有不少时间。她住在城镇的南区，那里以前还叫箱根，不是东京-3。别担心，我会让第二部门严密监视的。

"Me?" Asuka asked as she stared at the picture of Rei on the card. "I don't even know her! And where are her parents? She's Commander's daughter, isn't she?"
我吗？" 明日香看着卡片上绫波的照片问道，"我都不认识她！她父母呢？她不是司令的女儿吗？

"The Commander is very busy with work, and her mother rarely goes to work," Misato explained; Asuka's eyes twitched at the mention of her' mother', not unnoticed by Misato. "Oh, getting flustered by a pretty girl's picture, Asuka?" Misato teased. "Just be honest with me! You think she's sexy don't you?"
司令工作非常忙，她母亲也很少去上班，" 美里解释道；提到"母亲"时，明日香的眼睛抽搐了一下，美里并未忽视这一点。"哦，被漂亮女孩的照片弄得心烦意乱了，明日香？" 美里调侃道，"坦白告诉我吧！你觉得她性感，对吧？

"SHUT IT, Misato!" 闭嘴，美里！

"So, you don't find her cute then?" Misato asked innocently.
"那么，你不觉得她可爱吗？" 碇真嗣天真地问道。

In fact, even Asuka, the walking definition of heterosexual, found Rei at least could be considered cute. "Well, she looks not half-bad as me."
实际上，就连自诩为异性恋典范的明日香，也觉得绫波至少算得上可爱。"嗯，她看起来也不比我差多少。"

"Oh, Asuka!" Misato said in that voice, "You're in love!"
哦，明日香！" 碇真嗣用那种语气说道，"你恋爱了！

"No I'm not!" Asuka moaned, "Stop teasing me, Misato! I'm NOT LESBIAN!"
我没有！" 明日香哀怨地说，"别逗我了，碇真嗣！我不是同性恋！

"Payback's a bitch, eh?" Misato winked.
"报应不爽，对吧？" 美里眨了眨眼。

"Just…shut up!" Asuka cried in frustration.
"就…闭嘴吧！" 明日香恼怒地喊道。

"So, will you go?" Misato asked.
"那你会去吗？" 美里问道。

"Well, I will if you ask properly." Although Asuka was tempted to know this weird and cute-looking coworker, her pride wouldn't let her give in just yet.
"嗯，你要是好好请求的话，我就去。" 尽管明日香对这位看起来既奇怪又可爱的同事感到好奇，但她的自尊心还不允许她轻易让步。

"Will you go, Asuka, please?" Misato mock begged.
"你能去吗，明日香，求你了？" 美里半开玩笑地恳求道。

"Hmph, now I will," Asuka said happily as she walked to her room and started changing her clothes.
"哼，那我现在就去。" 明日香开心地说着，走向自己的房间开始换衣服。

Asuka was walking along to Rei's apartment as Misato had instructed her to do. She was in the residential section of town, and everything looked peaceful. There were trees lined up on both sides of the road, a rare sight in Japan, a country that values space. The road was clean, and the lines were fresh. The sound of cicadas accompanied by birds squeaking, producing a beautiful remix of music of nature.
按照美里的指示，明日香正前往绫波的公寓。她走在城市的住宅区，四周一片宁静。道路两旁整齐地排列着树木，这在重视空间的日本是难得一见的景象。路面干净，标线清晰。蝉鸣与鸟叫交织，大自然的美妙乐章在此刻和谐奏响。

Asuka looked at one of the two-floor apartments and saw it was the one she was looking for. 'Ayanami lives here?' She thought, 'This is practically a villa! I bet being Commander's daughter really provided her some privileges!' Asuka walked upstairs till he got to the second floor. The building on the inside was just as clean and aesthetic and degraded as it looked on the outside. She found apartment 204 without any problem. The door of the apartment had an electronic lock on it.
明日香看着其中一栋两层公寓，确认这就是她要找的地方。'绫波住这儿？'她心想，'这简直是个别墅！我猜作为司令的女儿，她确实享有一些特权！'明日香走上楼梯，直到抵达二楼。建筑内部和外观一样干净、雅致，也透着几分陈旧。她毫不费力地找到了 204 号公寓。公寓的门上装有一个电子锁。

Asuka pressed the doorbell.
明日香按响了门铃。

Ding Dong 叮咚

"Who is it?" A female voice sounded.
"是谁？"一个女声响起。

"Ikari? Are you home? It's Asuka! Hello?"
碇？你在家吗？我是明日香！喂？

"Oh, I'm coming!" Asuka heard footsteps coming to the door. A few seconds later, the door hissed open, and the blue-haired Rei 'Ayanami' Ikari stood in front of her. "Oh, hi, Asuka! What's your business here?" She smiled politely.
"哦，我来了！"明日香听到脚步声朝门口走来。几秒钟后，门嘶嘶地开了，蓝发的绫波'绫波'碇站在她面前。"哦，嗨，明日香！你来有什么事吗？"她礼貌地微笑着。

"Hey, Ikari!" Asuka greeted back, "hmmm," she pulled out Rei's ID card, handing it to her, "well, here's your new ID card, and I'm feeling generous enough today to deliver it to you in person!"
嘿，碇！"明日香回应道，"嗯，"她掏出绫波的身份证，递给她，"喏，这是你的新身份证，我今天心情好，亲自给你送来了！

"Oh, thanks," Rei took the ID card; she thought, "Lilith' that day said I should get Shinji and Asuka romantically involved, seeing they are not on good terms today, maybe now I can talk to her and help them out.' Having made a decision, Rei continued, "why don't you come in and have a rest? It must've been a long way coming here!"
哦，谢谢，"绫波接过身份证；她心想，"莉莉丝那天说，我应该撮合真嗣和明日香，看他们今天关系不好，或许现在我可以和她谈谈，帮他们一把。"打定主意后，绫波继续说，"不如你进来休息一下吧？来这里一定走了很长的路！

'Well, why not?' Asuka thought, 'she is a coworker, and she was a fellow pilot. Might as well befriend her.' "Alright," Asuka walked cautiously into the apartment. She slipped off her shoes in the entryway and walked inside, and closed the door behind her.
'嗯，为什么不呢？' 明日香心想，'她是同事，也曾是并肩作战的飞行员。不妨与她交个朋友。' "好吧，" 明日香小心翼翼地走进公寓。她在玄关处脱下鞋子，步入室内，随后关上了门。

The inside of the apartment was eastern-style and exquisitely decorated. The dining table was made of marble, and the floor was paved by crude wood. Everything radiated the smell of bourgeoisie – Asuka wasn't particularly jealous since her own family, the Langley estate, was much wealthier. Still, she couldn't help but feel envious since apparently, in this new world she couldn't get such luxury accommodation.
公寓内部采用东方式装潢，精致而典雅。餐桌是大理石制成，地板则铺着粗犷的木板。一切都散发着资产阶级的气息——明日香并不特别嫉妒，毕竟她自己的家族，兰格利家族，要富裕得多。然而，她还是忍不住感到羡慕，因为显然在这个新世界里，她无法获得这样的奢华住所。

She sat on the couch as Rei said, who went to make some tea. Asuka was curious about the friendliness of the First Child, but she shook it off, thinking it's just Japanese etiquette.
她按照绫波的指示坐在沙发上，绫波则去泡茶。明日香对第一适格者的友好态度感到好奇，但她摇了摇头，认为这只是日本人的礼节。

Rei came back to two cups of red tea and put one in front of her. Asuka smiled and murmured an almost inaudible 'arigato', then picked up the cup and took one small sip. The tea was well-made; it reminded her of her own mother, who occasionally would make red tea for her.
绫波端来两杯红茶，将其中一杯放在她面前。明日香微笑着，低声几乎听不见地说了声 '谢谢'，然后拿起杯子轻啜了一口。茶泡得很好；这让她想起了自己的母亲，偶尔也会为她泡红茶。

Thinking about her own mother, Asuka felt a twitch in her stomach and shook her thoughts off. However it did make her curious about Rei's mother. "Hmmm, Ikari-san?"
想起自己的母亲，明日香感到胃里一阵抽搐，随即甩开了这些念头。但这确实让她对绫波的母亲产生了好奇。“嗯，碇小姐？”

"Yes, Shikinami-san?" Rei lifted her head and looked at Asuka.
“是的，式波小姐？”绫波抬起头，看向明日香。

"Where's your…mother?" Asuka swallowed.
“你妈妈……在哪里？”明日香咽了口唾沫。

"Oh, she's out in the grocery store I think," Rei answered, "she might be back in 20 minutes."
“哦，她应该去杂货店了，”绫波回答，“可能二十分钟后回来。”

"Oh." Asuka didn't know how she should feel about that. It seemed everyone had a mother, except her. No wait… there's another person whom she was sure didn't have a mother…
"哦。" 明日香不知道该如何感受这一点。似乎每个人都有母亲，除了她。等等……还有一个人，她确信也没有母亲……

'On the other hand…Rei Ikari…Gendo Ikari…does this mean Rei's mother is Shinji Ikari's mother?' Asuka elaborated, 'well, in this world the answer is no, but Rei's mother must look and act like Shinji's mother in the world we knew. Then what if…my mother is still alive somewhere in this world?' She couldn't suppress a wide grin as the thought struck her like a runaway train and was interrupted by Rei's voice, "Shikinami-san? What do you think about Shikinami-kun? Why do you guys have the same surname?"
'另一方面……绫波丽……碇源堂……这是否意味着绫波的母亲是碇真嗣的母亲？' 明日香思索着，'嗯，在这个世界答案是否定的，但绫波的母亲在我们所知的世界里一定长得和行为都像真嗣的母亲。那么如果……我的母亲在这个世界的某个地方还活着呢？' 她无法抑制住因这个念头如脱缰野马般袭来而露出的宽阔笑容，却被绫波的声音打断，"式波小姐？你对式波君怎么看？为什么你们有相同的姓氏？"

Asuka snapped out of her thoughts, and her head jolted upwards, "Ah! Well, Shikinami-kun? Oh, you mean Baka-Shinji, right? He's just a pervert and an idiot, nothing more. I tolerate him only because we work together."
明日香从思绪中回过神来，猛地抬起头，"啊！哦，式波君？哦，你是说笨蛋真嗣吧，对吧？他只是个变态加白痴，仅此而已。我容忍他只是因为我们一起工作。"

"Well, but I think he's cute," Rei retorted. She thought making Asuka jealous could be a good way to force her to admit her feelings, "I'm interested."
不过，我觉得他挺可爱的，" 绫波反驳道。她认为让明日香嫉妒可能是迫使她承认自己感情的好方法，"我感兴趣。

"Is that so? Then you can claim him for all I care," Asuka said, although she felt a tingle of tightness in her chest hearing Rei's confessions, "I'm sure you two will make a good couple together!"
是吗？那你尽管把他占为己有好了，"明日香说道，尽管听到绫波的坦白，她的胸口感到一阵紧缩，"我相信你们俩在一起会很般配的！

Rei could see it all from her face – Asuka's eyebrows were twitching slightly, and she was swallowing. She was nervous. Rei smiled, "what did he do to make you hate him? He's nice enough to me."
绫波从明日香的脸上看出了端倪——她的眉毛微微颤动，还在吞咽口水。她很紧张。绫波微笑着说："他做了什么让你这么讨厌他？他对我挺好的。"

Asuka felt another tingle of jealousy hearing Shinji was 'nice' to Rei, "then why don't you just invite him into your bed already?!"
听到真嗣对绫波"挺好"的，明日香又感到一阵嫉妒，"那你干嘛不干脆把他请上你的床呢？！"

Rei was a bit taken aback by the sudden outburst – she was also bemused by the stubbornness of her. Just as she was about to say something, Asuka stood up, "Thanks for the hospitality, but I think I should take my leave."
绫波被这突如其来的爆发弄得有些措手不及——她对明日香的固执也感到好笑。正当她要开口说些什么时，明日香站了起来，"谢谢你的款待，但我想我该告辞了。"

Rei didn't stop her as Asuka exited the apartment. 'What a weird girl…'
绫波并未阻止明日香离开公寓。'真是个奇怪的女孩…'

Wednesday 星期三

Kensuke sat in the grass with stacks of photos next to him. He had a small sign next to him that read "Great Deal! ¥30 per photo!" Next to him on the ground were several numbered boxes, each containing different pictures of Asuka. Kensuke had spent the last few days taking the pictures wherever he could. Of her drinking water, walking around, swimming in gym class. He'd even snapped a few photos of the girls changing in the classroom by climbing surreptitiously up the tree next to the window. He was selling the photos he got of the girls in their bras and panties, but he was keeping the photos he shot that were less clothed to himself.
健介坐在草地上，身旁堆放着一叠叠照片。他旁边立着一个小牌子，上面写着“大优惠！每张照片 30 日元！”地上还摆着几个标有序号的盒子，里面装着不同场景下的明日香的照片。健介在过去几天里，抓住一切机会拍摄明日香，无论是她喝水、四处走动，还是在体育课上游泳。他甚至偷偷爬上教室窗户旁的树，拍下了女生们在教室里换衣服的照片。他正在出售那些拍到女生们穿着内衣的照片，而那些更为暴露的照片则被他私藏起来。

He had sold several dozen photos already, and Toji had declined to help him, but also wouldn't tell anyone what he was doing because he's no rat. Kensuke was just packing up when Mari wandered over. Kensuke went white as he tried to gather the pictures up quickly, but Mari stopped him.
他已经卖出了几十张照片，而东治虽然拒绝帮忙，但也没有告发他，毕竟他不是那种告密者。正当健介收拾东西准备离开时，玛丽走了过来。健介脸色一白，急忙想把照片收起来，但玛丽阻止了他。

"Why so nervous, pervert?" Mari asked with a devilish smile.
"干嘛这么紧张，变态？" 玛丽带着邪魅的笑容问道。

"No reason!" Kensuke said worriedly.
"没什么理由！" 健介担忧地说。

"Really, then why are you hiding all the photos of the princess?" A wink.
"真的吗？那为什么要把公主的照片都藏起来呢？" 一个眨眼。

"P-princess?" 公、公主？

"Oh, you know, the exotic redhead who just transferred here this Monday," Mari explained, pushing her glasses up a bit, "why hide them? Hmm?"
哦，就是那个这周一刚转来的异国红发女孩，" 玛丽解释道，推了推眼镜，"有什么好藏的？嗯？

"I don't get no photos." Kensuke panicked.
"我可没拍什么照片。" 健介慌了神。

"Yeah, that's not what I heard." Mari looked around, making sure no one would see them, "I want the one where you have all the girls changing."
是吗，我听说的可不是这样。" 玛丽环顾四周，确保没人会看到他们，"我要的是那张你偷拍所有女生换衣服的照片。

"Why? Are you into girls or something?" Kensuke asked perversely.
"怎么？你对女生感兴趣还是怎么的？" 健介挑逗地问道。

"No, I saw I looked pretty good in it, and I want a copy of each of the three for myself. Here's your ¥90 to prove I'm serious."
不，我照镜子觉得挺好看的，我想给自己留一份，每种三张。这是你的 90 元，证明我是认真的。

"How did you find out?"
你怎么知道的？

"Well, I saw a bunch of guys all hard over something, and I took a peek," Mari said sheepishly. "Besides, I don't mind when people take pictures of me, I'm always flattered."
嗯，我看到一群人兴奋得不得了，就凑过去看了看，"玛丽有些不好意思地说，"再说，我不介意别人给我拍照，我总是感到荣幸。

"You do realize you're not the subject of these photos?" Kensuke said, confused.
"你明白这些照片的主角不是你吗？"健介困惑地说。

"Yes, the princess is." Mari said. "But I don't care about that. Just take my money and give me what I asked for!"
是的，公主确实如此。"玛丽说，"但我不在乎那个。快拿我的钱，给我我要的东西！

"Fine, fine, here you go." Kensuke handed Mari the pictures she wanted before continuing with a fearful tone, "Just keep this quiet, I don't want to die by Shikinami's hand! She's only been here for three days and has already put five separate guys into hospitals!"
好吧，好吧，给你。"健介把玛丽想要的图片递给她，然后用一种恐惧的语气继续说，"只是这事你得保密，我可不想死在四谷的手下！她才来三天，就已经把五个不同的家伙送进了医院！

"Really, and then explain how I knew about it?" Mari said sarcastically, "Not likely. Bye pervert!" Mari said as she walked away, leaving Kensuke in complete disbelief.
"真的吗，那我怎么知道这件事的呢？"玛丽讽刺地说，"不可能。再见，变态！"玛丽说着走开了，留下健介一脸难以置信。

Putting all the love letters she gathered from her locker into the incinerator, Asuka's sour mood finally improved a little as she watched those meaningless and hollow papers burnt into ashes. The Class Rep told her she could dispose of her trashes after school – and she did. She hated dealing with boys – they were all perverted and dumb, not worth her precious time at all. Before, she had Kaji to idolize, now in this new world, Kaji didn't even know her, and apparently, he wanted nothing to do with her as well. It's okay, though. The great Asuka Langley Soryu didn't need anybody.
将她从储物柜收集来的所有情书投入焚化炉，看着那些空洞无意义的纸张化为灰烬，明日香的郁闷心情终于有所缓解。班长告诉她放学后可以处理垃圾——她照做了。她讨厌应付男生——他们全都下流又愚蠢，根本不值得她宝贵的时间。以前，她还有加持可以崇拜，现在在这个新世界，加持甚至不认识她，显然，他也无意与她有任何瓜葛。不过没关系。伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷不需要任何人。

For some reason the image of Shinji showed up in her mind. She shook it off violently, blaming it as the after-effect of that 'wet dream.' To her Shinji was simply another perverted little boy! Why would someone as brilliant as her would ever –
不知为何，真嗣的形象突然浮现在她脑海中。她猛地摇头将其驱散，将其归咎于那场“春梦”的后遗症。对她来说，真嗣不过是另一个下流的小男孩！像她这样才华横溢的人怎么可能——

'But he was also an EVA pilot,' another voice in her mind said, 'and he fought the Angels by your side.'
“但他也是 EVA 的驾驶员，”她脑海中的另一个声音说道，“而且他与你并肩作战对抗使徒。”

'But I don't remember it!' Asuka retorted, 'and I bet he performed pathetically during the battles! I might have saved his life several times already!'
“但我根本不记得！”明日香反驳道，“而且我敢打赌他在战斗中表现得很差劲！我可能已经救过他好几次命了！”

'Don't be silly, little girl. Have you ever thought about the reason you two are here? You were both EVA pilots, isn't that a bit coincidental?'
'别傻了，小姑娘。你有没有想过你们俩为什么会在这里？你们都是 EVA 驾驶员，这不是有点巧合吗？'

'I know that already! But…' the fact was Asuka had never thoroughly thought about the possible reasons. There were too many things to deal with, so it had slipped her mind. Now that things were more or less settled into a routine, she could do more thinking and less planning. The incinerator still needed several minutes or so to completely dispose of the hill of love letters, anyway.
'这个我早就知道了！但是……'实际上，明日香从未深入思考过可能的原因。需要处理的事情太多，这件事就被她抛到了脑后。现在事情差不多都进入了正轨，她可以多思考，少计划。反正焚化炉还需要几分钟才能彻底处理掉那堆情书。

'Well, I guess it had something to do with the EVAs,' Asuka reasoned to an apparent conclusion, 'but I really don't see how those robots could…' she paused her train of thought as she reached to a terrifying possibility, 'unless…it was the Angels?'
'嗯，我想这可能和 EVA 有关，'明日香推理到了一个明显的结论，'但我真的不明白那些机器人怎么会……'她停下了思绪，触及到了一个可怕的可能性，'除非……是使徒？'

'Maybe, maybe not.' Her own mind said, 'that's for you to discover on your own.'
'也许吧，也许不是。'她自己的内心说道，'这需要你自己去发现。'

Asuka grumbled in frustration, turned off the incinerator as it's done the job, and hurriedly left the room. She went back to the gloomy classroom with a surprisingly tolerating mood – burning stuff to ashes had satisfied her destrudo. Walking into the doors, she saw an odd scene. The school was over, and Mari, apparently on duty that day, was alone in the classroom, sitting on her chair and leaning backward, her eyes appreciating something held in her hand.
明日香不满地嘟囔着，确认焚化炉已完成任务后便匆匆离开了房间。她带着出奇容忍的心情回到了阴沉的教室——将物品化为灰烬满足了她的破坏欲。走进教室，她目睹了一幕奇怪的场景。学校已经放学，那天显然是值日的玛丽独自一人在教室里，坐在椅子上向后仰着，目光专注地欣赏着手中拿着的某样东西。

"Makinami?" Asuka said, confused, "What are you doing here so late?"
玛金米？" 明日香困惑地问道，"这么晚了你还在这里做什么？

Mari practically jumped from her seat, almost falling flat on the ground. "Ahhh!" She yelped in surprise, hastily shoving the stuff she was looking at into her pocket, "N-nothing!"
玛丽几乎是从座位上跳了起来，差点摔个四脚朝天。"啊！" 她惊叫一声，急忙将正在看的东西塞进口袋，"没、没什么！"

Asuka narrowed her eyes in suspicion, "Hm. What were you looking at?"
明日香眯起眼睛，怀疑地问道，"嗯？你刚才在看什么？"

"I, I think I should leave now," Mari tried to diverge the subject, she stood up and walked towards the door, "s-see you later, Princess!"
我，我觉得我现在应该走了，" 玛丽试图转移话题，她站起来走向门口，"再，再见，公主！

Although Asuka was tempting to stop her and demand explanation, she quickly squashed the thought, thinking she was just paranoid. After all, it wasn't any of her business to care about other people's doings. She also wanted to go back to her apartment.
尽管明日香很想叫住她，要求一个解释，但她很快打消了这个念头，觉得自己可能只是多疑了。毕竟，关心别人的事情并不是她的分内之事。她也想回自己的公寓了。

Just as she was about to turn around and leave as well, she found something on the floor. It looked like a small piece of paper; upon further inspection, she identified it as a photo. Mari turned around as well, seeing the photo lying on the floor, she paled and searched her pocket – and found nothing. "Oh crap…"
正当她也要转身离开时，她发现地上有样东西。看起来像是一小片纸；仔细一看，她认出那是一张照片。玛丽也转过身来，看到地板上的照片，她的脸色顿时苍白，急忙摸了摸口袋——却什么也没找到。"糟糕……"

Asuka shot her an incredulous glare, walked over, and picked up the photo.
明日香投去一个难以置信的眼神，走过去，捡起了照片。

"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!"
这他妈是什么?!

"Look, princess," seeing no way out of this, Mari decided to play cool for the moment, "I can explain…"
听着，公主，" 意识到无路可退，玛丽决定暂时装酷，"我可以解释…

"Where. Did. You. Get. This?" Asuka hissed out word by word, her glare powerful enough to put Ramiel at shame. "Explain. Rapidly."
你。从。哪。儿。弄。来。的？" 明日香一字一顿地逼问，她的目光锐利到足以让雷米尔都自愧不如。"快。说。

"So, err, don't think I'm into girls or something!" Mari summoned all her willpower to meet Asuka's gaze and still failed miserably, "I got this cuz I look good in that!" Asuka's glare softened from 'Ramiel's last shot at unit 01' to 'Ramiel's second-to-last shot at Unit 01', "And…I got this f-from…" Mari swallowed, internally apologizing to the poor boy she was sure whose body would never be found, "A-Aida."
那个，呃，别以为我喜欢女孩子什么的！" 玛丽竭尽全力去直视明日香的眼睛，却还是败下阵来，"我拿这个是因为我穿那件好看！" 明日香的目光从"雷米尔对 01 号机的最后一击"缓和到了"雷米尔对 01 号机的倒数第二击"，"而且…我这…这个是从…" 玛丽吞了吞口水，内心向那个她确信尸骨无存的可怜男孩道歉，"相…相田那里拿的。

"Aida?" Asuka pondered for a moment, realizing he was Shinji's friend, which seemed to add another item to the 'why I hate Shinji list'. "How did you get this? Did you…request him to take a shot of you? Because it looks like I am the one at the center of the photo!"
Aida?" 明日香沉思片刻，意识到他是真嗣的朋友，这似乎又为“我讨厌真嗣的理由”清单添上了一笔。"你怎么拿到这张照片的？难道你……让他拍了这张照片？因为看起来我才是照片的焦点！

"Well…he, he took the pictures himself…" Asuka's glare intensified by an exponential, "and, he…sold it to me."
嗯……他，他自己拍的……" 明日香的目光愈发锐利，"然后，他……卖给了我。

Mari could practically feel the room temperature rose by 10 degrees caused by the increase in entropy under Asuka's sheer fury. "I see. So he's selling pictures about me." Her voice oddly calm, contrary to the creaking and bending desk squeezed by her hand. She said none other words and pushed past Mari, who was suffocating under the intense atmosphere.
玛丽几乎能感觉到房间的温度因明日香纯粹的愤怒而上升了十度，熵值大增。"我明白了。所以他是在卖关于我的照片。" 她的声音异常平静，与她手中紧握的桌子发出的吱嘎声形成鲜明对比。她没有再说其他话，径直从玛丽身边走过，后者在这股强烈的气氛下几乎窒息。

Seeing the redheaded devil went downstairs with ground-breaking steps, Mari let out a breath she didn't know she was holding. She could only wish good luck to the glass-wearing boy.
看到红发魔女以震地之势下楼，玛丽这才意识到自己一直屏着呼吸。她只能默默祝愿那位戴眼镜的男孩好运。

Thursday morning 星期四早晨

"Horaki-san, we have a problem." Asuka said, rushing up to her the moment she saw her. Last night and this morning had been hell for the poor Misato, who endured Asuka's wrath since she was the only one there. Asuka intended to resolve the problem as soon as possible, so she uncharacteristically got up early and came to school, around the same time Hikari arrived.
"小原同学，我们遇到麻烦了。" 明日香一见到她便急匆匆地跑过来。昨晚到今早对可怜的葛城来说简直是地狱，因为只有她在场，所以承受了明日香的怒火。明日香打算尽快解决问题，于是她一反常态地早起，和光里差不多同时到了学校。

"Good morning! What's up Shikinami-san?" Hikari The Dutiful And Punctual Class Rep glanced at Asuka, surprised that someone came to school as early as she did.
"早上好！出什么事了吗，式波同学？" 光里这位尽职又守时的班长看着明日香，惊讶于居然有人和她一样早到学校。

"There is no 'good' morning, Horaki-san!" seeing no one else has come to class yet, Asuka raised her volume, pulling out the photo to show it to Hikari, "that fucking degenerated perverted hentai Aida is selling filthy photos of me he took!"
这哪有什么‘早上好’，洞木同学！"见教室里还没其他人，明日香提高了音量，掏出照片展示给光，"那个下流变态的绫波在卖偷拍我的肮脏照片！

Hikari's face stiffened. "Asuka, how do you know exactly?"
光的脸色一僵。"明日香，你怎么知道的？"

"That's not important, Class Rep!" Asuka barked, "our top priority should be stopping him, don't you think?"
那不重要，班长！"明日香厉声道，"我们当务之急是阻止他，不是吗？

"Right," Hikari sighed, "let's wait for him to show up."
也对，"光叹了口气，"等他来了再说吧。

One hour later 一小时后

Hikari and Asuka found Kensuke under a tree, far from the school building. They decided to sneak up behind him and scare him, while Asuka could hide and wait for Hikari to interrogate him first. "KENSUKE!" Hikari shouted. Kensuke jumped so severely, he knocked over several of his boxes, spreading photos all over the ground. He tried to get up, but he slid on the loose photos and fell back to the ground quite hard. "What the hell do you think you're doing, Aida?!" Hikari asked.
光和明日香在一棵远离教学楼的树下找到了健介。他们决定悄悄绕到他背后吓他一跳，而明日香则躲起来，等光先审问健介。"健介！"光大喊一声。健介吓得跳了起来，不小心打翻了几箱照片，散落一地。他试图站起来，却滑倒在散乱的照片上，重重地摔回地面。"你到底在搞什么鬼，相田？！"光质问道。

"I'm not sure what you're talking about…" Kensuke retreated.
"我不明白你在说什么……"健介退缩道。

"Bullshit!" Hikari I Do Not Swear Horaki swore, "You're selling pictures of Asuka! Pictures you took, like a pervert! Sneaking around and catching her unawares!"
胡说八道！"光，我发誓，"你在卖明日香的照片！那些你偷拍的，像个变态！偷偷摸摸地趁她不备！

"I did not!" Kensuke lied.
"我没有！"健介撒谎道。

Hikari opened several of the boxes on the ground. "Really? You're a bad liar Kensuke." Hikari glared at him disbelievingly, "So, what are all these publicity photos? You can't do this to your classmates!"
光打开地上的几个箱子。“真的吗？你真不会撒谎，健介。”光怀疑地瞪着他，“那这些宣传照片是怎么回事？你不能这样对待同学！”

"No, they're just a hobby of mine." Kensuke improvised.
“不，这只是我的一个爱好。”健介临时编了个理由。

Asuka couldn't stand his bull crap anymore. She came out from the ambush, eliciting a fearful yelp from the boy as he set his eyes on her. "How do you explain this, Arschloch?" She said, taking out the photo, slamming it in front of Kensuke.
明日香再也受不了他的胡扯了。她从埋伏中现身，让那男孩一看到她就吓得尖叫起来。“你怎么解释这个，混蛋？”她说着，拿出照片，猛地拍在健介面前。

Kensuke was about to have a panic attack. During her first several days at school, Asuka had already earned several nicknames, such as 'irritable Red bitch', 'the bloodthirsty Red Devil', and 'Menstruating Permanente'. He had seen what happened to boys who dared to cross her boundaries - now he was at the center of her crosshair.
健介快要恐慌发作了。在明日香刚来学校的那几天，她就已经赢得了几个绰号，比如“易怒的红发婊子”、“嗜血的红魔”和“经期永久”。他见过那些胆敢越过她界限的男孩的下场——现在他自己成了她的目标。

Seeing no reaction coming out from the frozen boy, Asuka turned her attention to the boxes on the ground. She opened several more boxes until she found the ones she was looking for, the ones of the classroom with the girls changing for gym. "And what about these?!" Asuka shouted, showing them to Hikari.
见那冻僵的男孩毫无反应，明日香将注意力转向地上的箱子。她又打开了几箱，直到找到她要找的那些——教室里女生们换体育服的照片。“那这些呢？！”明日香大声质问，向光展示那些照片。

"You fucking pervert!" Hikari yelled as well, "You climbed the fucking tree to spy on the girls changing?! You're sick!"
“你这个变态！”光也怒吼道，“你爬树偷看女生换衣服？！你真恶心！”

"I am not!" Kensuke dropped his innocent pretense. "I did it to get a good shot of everything! People want to see the hot foreign girl, and If I make a bit of cash off the deal, who cares?! No one's getting hurt, are they?!" The biggest false statement he could make that time, both literally and metaphorically.
“我没有！”健介丢掉了无辜的伪装，“我这么做是为了拍到好镜头！人们想看那个火辣的外国女孩，如果我能从中赚点钱，谁在乎呢？！又没人受伤，不是吗？！”这是他当时能说的最大的谎言，无论字面上还是比喻上。

He was hit square in the face by Asuka – who was determined to prove his statement wrong. With all the combat training she received, she delivered a perfect hit using her fist, causing moderate lasting damage but making it as painful as possible, while causing minimal damage to her fist. Kensuke stumbled backward, his glasses bent inward.
他被明日香一拳正中面门——她决心证明他的话是错的。凭借她所受的战斗训练，她用拳头打出了一记完美的攻击，造成了中等程度的持续伤害，同时尽可能地增加了痛苦，却最大限度地减少了自己拳头的损伤。健介踉跄后退，眼镜向内弯曲。

Asuka moved to kick him, Hikari held her back. "Hokari, let go!" Asuka barked as she struggled against her. "Let go!" Not that she wasn't strong enough to break out of Hikari's futile attempt of restraining her, she simply didn't want to hurt Horaki as well, who was siding with her at that time.
明日香正要踢他，光却拉住了她。“光，放开我！”明日香挣扎着咆哮道，“放开！”并非她没有足够的力量挣脱光的无力束缚，只是她不想在那时伤害到站在自己这边的光。

"Asuka, you're going to get in trouble for hitting him." Hikari said worriedly, "As much as he deserved it, you'll be receiving more punishments! That hit is already enough to put you in a suspension! You're going to expose him for whatever secret you know about him, remember?"
“明日香，你这样打他会惹上麻烦的。”光担忧地说，“尽管他活该，但你会受到更多惩罚的！那一拳足以让你被停学了！你不是还要揭露他那些你掌握的秘密吗，记得吗？”

Asuka glared at Kensuke with a gaze that would make Gendo flinch. "Fine, Horaki, you win." Asuka huffed, "But I want to talk to him alone for a minute. I promise not to hurt him."
明日香用一种连源堂都会退缩的目光瞪着健介。“好吧，光，你赢了。”明日香气呼呼地说，“但我需要单独和他谈一分钟。我保证不会伤害他。”

"Sure, I'll go watch from over there." Hikari said, pointing to where she was walking.
“好的，我去那边看着。”光说着，指向她即将走去的方向。

"Ok, listen, you hentai!" Asuka spatted angrily, "I really do want to crush you with my feet right now, but I won't, for Hikari's sake. You owe her for that bigtime." Asuka paused and glared at Kensuke some more. "Now, if you ever want me to put you off my murder list, you will buy back all those pictures. If it takes more money than you've earned, then that's your problem. I'll ask Hikari to go with you to each pervert you sold them to scare them into selling them back to you. As for the naked pictures… I'll take and burn them and all in the rest, with all the negatives and any copies you have stashed in the incinerator, got it?"
喂，听着，你这个变态！"明日香愤怒地斥责道，"我现在真想一脚踩扁你，但看在光的面子上，我不会这么做。你欠她一个大人情。"明日香停顿了一下，又狠狠地瞪了健介一眼。"现在，如果你想从我的暗杀名单上除名，你就得把那些照片全买回来。如果需要的钱比你赚的还多，那也是你自己的问题。我会让光陪你去找每一个你卖给他们照片的变态，吓唬他们把照片卖还给你。至于那些裸照……我会拿去烧掉，连同所有的底片和任何你藏起来的副本一起，扔进焚化炉，明白了吗？

The quick and continuous nods were the only confirmation she got.
她得到的唯一确认就是对方迅速而连续的点头。

"Er ist so ein Arschloch! Ich kann es nicht glauben! Ich werde ihn in Stücke reißen!" It was about the tenth time that day Asuka cursed about the photo incident at Shinji, yet she still hadn't used the same line more than once, "Look what kinds of friends you make, Baka!" She poked Shinji's ribs using her elbow, eliciting a pained groan from the aforementioned boy.
"他真是个混蛋！我简直不敢相信！我要把他撕成碎片！"那天，明日香已经第十次因为照片事件咒骂真嗣了，但她仍然没有重复过任何一句话，"看看你交的都是些什么朋友，笨蛋！"她用肘部戳了戳真嗣的肋骨，引得那个男孩发出一声痛苦的呻吟。

Shinji wanted no more than vanishing from the air, however he figured listening to Asuka's rant was probably better than she ignoring him; at least she was willing to talk with him. "I'm sorry! I didn't know…"
真嗣只想从空气中消失，但他觉得听明日香发牢骚或许比她无视自己要好；至少她还愿意和自己说话。"对不起！我不知道……"

"What are you sorry for?" Asuka interrupted him, "Gott, why you Japanese people always apologize when they did nothing wrong?"
你为什么道歉？"明日香打断他，"天哪，为什么你们日本人总在没做错事时道歉？

Shinji squashed another automatic response with a considerable amount of will, "I, err, I remember being friends with them? I mean, I was friends with them, and they weren't so bad…"
真嗣费了好大劲才压下本能的回应，"我，呃，我记得和他们做朋友？我是说，我和他们是朋友，他们其实也没那么糟……"

Asuka huffed, "well, I'd say you really don't have good taste in friends," Shinji just looked down in response, "and I even got suspended from school for a week!"
明日香哼了一声，"那我只能说你交友品味真差，"真嗣只是低头不语，"而且我还因此被学校停学一周！"

"Well, I suppose he got what he deserved, right?" Shinji suddenly asked.
"嗯，我想他算是自食其果了吧，对吧？" 真嗣突然问道。

Asuka's face showed a turmoil of emotions at his words – surprise, anger, pride, and finally – reluctant joyfulness. "You better think so!" Asuka smiled a satisfied smile, "oh Gott, that punch was totally worth it…" She fake punched the tree beside her as she pouted, a fake frown on her face, trying to recall the satisfactory feeling. Shinji suddenly found her very cute acting like this…
明日香的脸上因他的话而情绪纷乱——惊讶、愤怒、骄傲，最终——不情愿的喜悦。"你最好这么认为！" 明日香满意地笑了，"哦，天哪，那一拳真是太值了……" 她假装对着旁边的树挥拳，噘着嘴，脸上挂着假装的皱眉，试图回忆那种满足感。真嗣突然觉得她这样子非常可爱……

He blushed, hastily turned around, hiding his face from the redhead. He was sure if she saw his reaction, he wouldn't be able to see tomorrow's sun. 'Think other stuff! Think other stuff!' Shinji thought, trying to think about anything other than the cute redhead…
他脸红了，急忙转过身去，不让红发女孩看到自己的脸。他确信如果她看到他的反应，他可能就见不到明天的太阳了。'想点别的！想点别的！' 真嗣想着，试图不去想那个可爱的红发女孩……

His blushed deepened. 他的脸更红了。

'No no no no!' he shook his head, 'what's my last night's dream? Oh right, Godzilla, explosion, EVAs…' he sighed in relief internally, 'I haven't seen the prophesier these days…I wonder where he is? Last time he told me Asuka and I…' he realized too late the final station of his train of thought.
'不不不不！'他摇头道，'我昨晚梦见什么来着？哦对，哥斯拉，爆炸，EVA……'他内心松了口气，'最近都没见到那个预言家……不知道他去哪儿了？上次他告诉我，明日香和我……'他意识到自己思维的终点站时已经太迟了。

His blush turned into an incandescent one.
他的脸红得发烫。

He started to realize his efforts were doomed from the start.
他开始意识到自己的努力从一开始就注定失败。

As polite and well-mannered as he was, he was still a teenage boy.
尽管他彬彬有礼，举止得体，但终究还是个青春期的少年。

"Huh? Third, what's gotten into you? You look…feverish," sarcastically it was Asuka's bemused voice that saved him from his indecent thoughts.
"嗯？第三，你怎么了？看起来……发烧了似的，"幸好是明日香那带着戏谑的声音，让他从那些不雅的思绪中解脱出来。

"S-sorry!" Autopilot running, check. "I…maybe it's the heat?" He improvised.
"对-对不起！"自动驾驶模式启动，检查。"我……可能是太热了吧？"他随口编了个理由。

"Hm," Asuka pondered for a moment and decided to let it slip. It was a bit hot that day, after all. "Get into shadows, dumbass!"
嗯，"明日香沉思片刻，决定不再追究。毕竟那天确实挺热的。"快躲到阴凉处去，笨蛋！

A screech of brakes captured both of their attention, Misato's voice came from the rolled-down window, "Hello, kids! Sorry I'm late! Get in the car! We have a lot to do today!"
一阵急促的刹车声吸引了两人的注意，美里从摇下的车窗里传来声音："嗨，孩子们！抱歉我来晚了！快上车！今天我们有很多事要做！"

Shinji and Asuka made another connection with the simulator and yielded wonderful results. Gendo Ikari was reading the report sent to him, while twelve monoliths emerged around him.
真嗣与明日香再次与模拟器建立了连接，取得了卓越的成果。源堂正在阅读发给他的报告，周围浮现出十二块巨石。

"We should move on to our next step, Ikari," SEELE 01 spoke, "let's see if they can connect with Lilith."
我们应迈向下一步了，源堂，" SEELE 01 说道，"看看他们是否能与莉莉丝建立联系。

"So fast?" SEELE 03 questioned, "we still have plenty of time at our hands."
这么快吗？" SEELE 03 质疑道，"我们手头还有充足的时间。

"The earlier we test it, the earlier we'll find problems," SEELE 01 retorted, "Ikari, arrange the contact experiment with Lilith as soon as possible."
越早测试，越早发现问题，" SEELE 01 反驳道，"碇，尽快安排与莉莉丝的接触实验。

"We still have plenty of time today," Gendo confirmed, "I'll ask Dr. Akagi to do the preparations for the contact experiment right now."
今天我们还有充足的时间，" 碇源堂确认道，"我会让赤木博士立即着手准备接触实验。

SEELE 01 pondered for a moment, "Go ahead. We shall see the results."
SEELE 01 沉思片刻，"开始吧。我们静待结果。"

"Okay, we're not quite done yet," Naoko's voice came through the comm channel, "we're going to do something new." For some reason, her tone was making Shinji nervous.
"好吧，我们还没完全结束，"直子的声音通过通讯频道传来，"我们要尝试一些新东西。"不知为何，她的语气让真嗣感到紧张。

"Yeah, yeah, just get this over with," Asuka said impatiently, "I'm doing all the chores today!" Misato grumbled something inaudible.
"行了行了，赶紧弄完吧，"明日香不耐烦地说，"今天所有的家务活都是我干的！"美里嘟囔了一句听不清的话。

Naoko ignored her comment and started working on her terminal. She switched the link from the simulator to Lilith – it was marked as another simulator since it's classified. After a thorough check and made sure everything was in order, she spoke to the kids, "we are about to start- you might see hallucinations, just ignore it. Just your brains playing tricks on you," Naoko explained with a tingle of nervousness. As a brilliant scientist as she was, she didn't know what exactly would happen if The Two were to connect with Lilith successfully. However, it was a risky step that must be taken. "Alright, starting initiation sequence. Shinji, we'll test you first, then Asuka."
直子没有理会她的话，开始操作自己的终端。她将链接从模拟器切换到莉莉丝——由于保密，它被标记为另一个模拟器。经过仔细检查确保一切正常后，她对孩子们说："我们即将开始——你们可能会看到幻觉，别理会。只是你们的大脑在捉弄你们，"直子解释时带着一丝紧张。作为一位杰出的科学家，她并不确切知道如果两者成功与莉莉丝连接会发生什么。然而，这是一步必须冒的风险。"好的，开始启动序列。真嗣，我们先测试你，然后是明日香。"

"Roger," Shinji replied. "收到，"真嗣回答道。

Inside the entry plugs, Shinji felt an odd sensation creeping up his body. At first, both of his hands felt numb, and then they started hurting. He felt something pierced through his hands, although the feelings were not strong enough to make him cry.
在插入栓内，真嗣感到一种奇异的感觉正爬遍全身。起初，他的双手感到麻木，随后开始疼痛。他感觉有什么东西穿透了双手，尽管这种感觉并不强烈到让他哭泣。

"First level connection established," Maya reported, having absolutely zero idea of what Shinji was connected with, "begin second phase connection."
第一级连接已建立，"玛雅报告道，她对真嗣连接的对象一无所知，"开始第二阶段连接。

Suddenly Shinji's vision went white. It was nothing like the kaleidoscope of colors he saw every time he was connected to a simulator – it was more like a sensor overload. Soon the sensations became unbearable, his brain struggled to process all the information carried by electronic signals. Shinji clutched his head in agony – not physical pain, but mental suffering. "Arghhhh! What is this?! Stop! Make it stop!" He shouted to the comm channel.
突然，真嗣的视野变得一片空白。这与每次连接模拟器时所见的色彩万花筒截然不同——更像是传感器过载。很快，这些感觉变得难以忍受，他的大脑挣扎着处理电子信号携带的所有信息。真嗣痛苦地抱住头——不是肉体的疼痛，而是精神的折磨。"啊啊啊！这是什么？！停下来！让它停下来！"他对着通讯频道大喊。

Asuka, sitting in her plug impatiently and anxiously, heard his scream. She felt a cold knot forming in her stomach as Shinji's pleas for help intensified. She didn't know why she felt that – she didn't exactly care about him, did she? Then why was she…worried?
坐在自己的插入栓中，焦急而不安的明日香听到了他的尖叫。随着真嗣求助的呼声加剧，她感到胃里形成了一个冰冷的结。她不明白自己为何会有这种感觉——她并不真的在乎他，不是吗？那她为什么……会感到担忧？

"Cut the connection! Abort the test!" Naoko order hastily, and Maya complied instantly. "Signal received! The connection is severed!"
切断连接！终止测试！" 直子急忙下令，玛雅立刻执行。"信号收到！连接已切断！

"Ohhhh…" Shinji panted heavily, his sensations returning back to normal. "Baka! What happened?" Asuka's voice came through the channel.
"哦……" 真嗣喘着粗气，感觉逐渐恢复正常。"笨蛋！发生了什么？" 明日香的声音从频道中传来。

Shinji raised an eyebrow. Asuka, of all people, was…worried about him? 'Maybe just like the prophesier said, we do have a chance after all.' He smiled internally, but too tired to show it on his face. "I…I don't know…but I think I'm okay, for now…" he replied in an almost whisper, but not unheard by the redhead.
真嗣挑了挑眉。明日香，居然会……担心他？'或许正如预言者所说，我们终究还是有希望的。' 他内心微笑，但疲惫得无法表现在脸上。"我……我不知道……但我想我现在还好……" 他低声回应，虽轻却足以让红发少女听见。

Asuka felt a huge weight was lifted from her shoulder, but she still couldn't rationalize her behaviors. She shook it off, thinking it was only her sympathy towards another human being.
明日香感到肩上的重担减轻了许多，但她仍无法解释自己的行为。她摇了摇头，将其归咎于对另一个人的同情。

In the observation room, everyone let out a sigh of relief as Shinji's vitals stabilized. At the same time Naoko was in a hurry to find possible causes. She read through the readings and the synchrograph, as well as Shinji's brain waves. "Hmm…interesting," Naoko found out the problem instantly – the sinusoidal wave of Lilith wasn't in the same phase as Shinji's, and the amplitude of it was two times larger as well. In English, Shinji didn't have enough mental power to handle all of Lilith.
在观察室内，随着真嗣的生命体征稳定下来，众人松了一口气。与此同时，直子急忙寻找可能的原因。她仔细查阅了读数、同步图以及真嗣的脑电波。“嗯……有趣，”直子立刻发现了问题所在——莉莉丝的正弦波与真嗣的波形不同相，且振幅是其两倍。换句话说，真嗣的精神力量不足以应对莉莉丝的全部影响。

Naoko sighed – although Shinji had already surpassed all former test subjects, namely – Rei, and several other random civilian volunteers who either developed severe mental disorders or fell into a coma – Gehirn did compensate their families with a satisfactory amount of money, but that didn't make it morally right; therefore, Gehirn had stopped picking random people to participate such tests. Those people never made it to first-level connections.
直子叹了口气——尽管真嗣已经超越了所有以往的测试对象，即——零，以及其他一些随机招募的平民志愿者，他们要么发展出严重的精神障碍，要么陷入昏迷——GEHIRN 确实给予了他们的家庭一笔可观的补偿金，但这并不能使这一切在道德上变得正确；因此，GEHIRN 已经停止了随机挑选人员参与此类测试。那些人从未达到过一级联系。

Now, the prophecy of the Dead Sea Scrolls has come true – The Two certainly possessed unnatural powers. Naoko wasn't about to give up yet – nor would Commander Ikari allow her to. She needed a plan, and fast.
如今，死海文书的预言已然成真——那两位确实拥有超乎自然的力量。直子并未打算就此放弃——指挥官碇源堂也不会允许她这么做。她需要一个计划，而且要快。

An idea clicked in her head. "Alright. Shinji, how are you feeling?"
一个念头在她脑海中闪现。"好吧。真嗣，你现在感觉怎么样？"

"Dizzier than usual, but otherwise okay," came his reply.
"比平时更晕一些，但其他还好。"他回答道。

"Good. We'll start another test-" "Are you crazy?!" Asuka cut in, "you saw what happened to him! And you just say 'start another test'?"
好。我们开始下一项测试——" "你疯了吗？！"明日香打断她，"你明明看到他刚才的样子！你就这么轻描淡写地说'开始下一项测试'？

"Silence, Second Child, and let me finish," Naoko's appellation to Asuka elicited a wave of nostalgia in her heart, silencing the redhead in an instant, "I've already made alterations to the system. It shouldn't happen again."
安静，第二适格者，让我说完。"直子对明日香的称呼在她心中激起一阵怀旧之情，瞬间让红发少女沉默了，"我已经对系统做了调整。应该不会再发生那种事了。

"Well that's reassuring…" Asuka murmured.
"哎呀，这可真让人安心…" 明日香低声嘟囔。

Naoko sighed, "Listen, I know you're worried about him, just-"
直子叹了口气，"听着，我知道你担心他，只是——"

"WHAT?!" Asuka blushed, "I-I'm not worried about him!"
什么？！" 明日香脸颊泛红，"我、我才没有担心他！

Although Shinji remembered what the prophesier told him – 'she doesn't mean what she says for most of the time' – it still stung. He managed to suppress his feelings for now.
尽管真嗣记得预言者告诉他的话——"她大多数时候说的并非真心"——这话还是刺痛了他。他勉强压下了此刻的情绪。

'Why The Two are fucking kids…' Naoko found no point in arguing with her, so she ignored her outburst and turned her attention to Shinji, "Shinji, do you feel ready for another test?"
'为什么这两个小屁孩……'直子觉得跟她争论毫无意义，便无视了她的爆发，转而看向真嗣，“真嗣，你准备好进行下一次测试了吗？”

Shinji swallowed. He was about to run away. He was about to say 'no'. But he remembered the prophesier's advice – don't run away. He closed his eyes, "Hmm, I'm okay, just make sure it won't happen again, alright?"
真嗣咽了口唾沫。他正想逃跑。他正要说“不”。但他记起了预言者的忠告——不要逃跑。他闭上眼睛，“嗯，我还行，只是确保不会再发生那样的事，好吗？”

"Good." Naoko sighed in relief. 'At least one of them is reasonable enough,,,'
“好。”直子松了口气。‘至少他们中还有一个是讲道理的……’

Naoko made some quick modifications to the linking system – she adjusted the connection route so that both Asuka and Shinji would be connected to Lilith simultaneously. "Alright. Are you guys ready?"
直子迅速对链接系统进行了一些调整——她调整了连接路径，使得明日香和真嗣将同时与莉莉丝相连。“好了。你们准备好了吗？”

"Yeah." They answered in unison.
"嗯。" 他们异口同声地回答。

"Begin connection sequence," Naoko ordered.
"开始连接序列，" 直子命令道。

Maya started typing on the keyboard, "first-level connection established," she reported, "should we continue?"
玛雅开始敲击键盘，"一级连接已建立，" 她报告说，"要继续吗？"

"Continue the test." 继续测试。

"Hai. Begin second phase."
海。开始第二阶段。

In the entry plugs, both Asuka and Shinji felt something strange. There was no kaleidoscope of colors, nor was there sensor overload. They found themselves inside a huge chamber, above an orange sea – they thought they were floating at first, and Shinji wanted to look at his left, while Asuka wanted to look at her right.
在插入栓内，明日香和真嗣都感觉到了异样。没有色彩的万花筒，也没有传感器过载。他们发现自己身处一个巨大的舱室中，上方是一片橙色的海洋——起初他们以为自己在漂浮，真嗣想向左看，而明日香则想向右看。

And nothing happened. 然而什么也没发生。

"Hey!" Asuka struggled in moving her body, "something's fighting me!"
喂！" 明日香挣扎着试图移动身体，"有什么东西在阻止我！

"Me too!" Shinji followed, "someone else is trying to move my body!"
我也是！" 真嗣紧跟着说，"有人试图操控我的身体！

Naoko looked at the reading on her terminal; at first, she couldn't help but grin widely. The interference of Asuka and Shinji's brain waves created a new wave, and it matched Lilith's perfectly. However, sometimes their waves showed a constructive interference, and everything worked fine. Other times they showed a destructive interference, and the combined wave became zero at those times. Seeing the evidence at hand and hearing the complaints coming from the Children, she put two and two together and figured it was caused by the discrepancies in their thoughts. "You two, focus on your thoughts!" She said into the channel.
直子看着终端上的读数，起初忍不住咧嘴大笑。明日香和真嗣的脑波干扰产生了一种新波形，与莉莉丝的完美匹配。然而，有时他们的波形表现出建设性干扰，一切运转正常；有时则是破坏性干扰，导致合成波在那些时刻归零。看到眼前的证据，听着孩子们的抱怨，她将两者联系起来，推断出这是由于他们思维中的差异所致。"你们两个，集中精神！" 她对着频道说道。

But it was too late. Asuka, tired of playing the tug of war, decided to force her will on whatever she was willing that time. Shinji immediately felt a strong sense of detachment, and his connection severed, leaving Asuka solely connected to Lilith.
但为时已晚。明日香厌倦了这场拉锯战，决定强行施加自己的意志于那一刻她所愿之事。真嗣立刻感到一种强烈的疏离感，他的连接被切断，只留下明日香独自与莉莉丝相连。

"Ahhhh!" Asuka started screaming. "What's happening?! Stop it!"
啊——！" 明日香开始尖叫，"发生了什么？！停下来！

"Cut the connection…" Naoko said with a dejected face, her terminal showing the result of Asuka's actions, "conclude the tests for today…"
切断连接…" 直子面带沮丧地说道，她的终端显示着明日香行动的结果，"今天的测试就到这里…

"What's your thoughts on this, Doctor?" having finished the report, Gendo was more surprised than satisfied.
"您对此有何看法，博士？" 看完报告后，源渡的惊讶多于满意。

"Well, they certainly need to work together to achieve a perfect connection with Lilith," Naoko replied, "and fortunately, we have something at our hand to help them."
嗯，他们确实需要共同努力，才能与莉莉丝实现完美连接，" 直子回答道，"所幸，我们手头有东西能帮到他们。

"That is?" Gendo raised an eyebrow.
"那是？" 源堂挑了挑眉。

"A specially designed equipment that can probe human brain waves – it can help them synchronize with their thoughts," Naoko explained, putting down a set of documents, "however, we still need outside influence – that is, although the equipment can force them to think about the same thing to a degree, they still need an external trigger on their thoughts."
一种特别设计的设备，能探测人类脑波——它能帮助他们与思维同步，" 直子解释道，放下一套文件，"然而，我们仍需外界影响——也就是说，尽管设备能迫使他们一定程度上思考同一件事，他们仍需外部触发他们的思维。

"Assuming they are humans in the first place," Gendo snorted.
"假设他们一开始就是人类，" 源堂嗤之以鼻。

"Well, the biopsy told me their physical component is not so different from humans, and their brain waveforms also match perfectly with humans," Naoko reassured, "at least we should give it a try, right?"
嗯，活检告诉我他们的物理成分与人类并无太大差异，他们的脑波也与人类完美匹配，" 直子安慰道，"至少我们应该试试，对吧？

"Your suggestion is acceptable," Gendo said with a wave of his hand, "dismissed."
你的建议可以接受，" 源渡挥了挥手说，"散会。

Shinji and Asuka sat side by side in the debriefing room, facing a cold-faced Dr. Akagi. Both Misato and Kaji were standing beside the door, Misato with her arms crossed, trying to ignore the Kaji's futile attempt of flirting. "Today's test results are…unacceptable," Naoko deadpanned, "I expected better of you two."
真嗣和明日香并排坐在简报室内，面对着面无表情的赤木博士。美里和加持站在门旁，美里双臂交叉，试图无视加持那无果的调情尝试。"今天的测试结果……令人无法接受，" 直子冷冷地说，"我本对你们俩抱有更高期望。"

Asuka stood up, pointing the finger at Shinji while facing Naoko, "This is all his fault! If he wasn't trying to distract me, I would've succeeded!"
明日香站起身来，指着真嗣向直子辩解，"这都是他的错！如果他不是故意分散我的注意力，我早就成功了！"

"How is this my fault?!" Shinji shot back, also standing up, "you were fighting against me!"
这怎么成了我的错了?!" 真嗣反驳道，也站了起来，"明明是你跟我对着干！

"I should be the dominant one, considering I am the genius, while you're just a jerk!" Asuka barked.
"按理说应该由我来主导，毕竟我是天才，而你不过是个混蛋！" 明日香厉声说道。

"I'm the jerk?" Shinji retorted, "I'm not the one who ruined the test by forcing her partner to disconnect!"
我是混蛋？" 真嗣回击，"我可不是那个因为强迫搭档断开连接而毁了测试的人！

"ENOUGH!" Naoko roared, 'How in the world are The Two so CHILDISH?' "JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR JOB HERE IS?"
够了！" 直子怒吼，'这两个家伙怎么这么幼稚？' "你们到底知不知道自己在这里的任务是什么？

"To…participate in your tests?" Asuka answered cautiously.
"参加...你们的测试吗？" 明日香小心翼翼地回答。

"Wrong! It's to make sure the human race has a brighter future!" Naoko exercised her technically true statement, "and we need you to work together!"
错！是为了确保人类拥有更光明的未来！" 直子运用她那技术上正确的说法，"而且我们需要你们合作！

"Why should we?!" Shinji and Asuka shouted to each other in unison.
"我们为什么要这么做？！" 真嗣和明日香异口同声地喊道。

"Just enough already…" Naoko sighed, having her spirits exhausted, "Katsuragi, Ryoji, brief them about the plan, I'm gonna take a rest…" She picked up her documents and left the room.
"够了..." 直子叹了口气，精神疲惫，"葛城，良治，给他们简述一下计划，我要去休息一下…" 她拿起文件，离开了房间。

"Just remind me why do we need kids for this job…" Misato grumbled in annoyance, "alright, I'll do it. Kaji, you can go and take the delivery."
就提醒我一下，为什么这活儿非得要小孩来做……" 惱火的碇真嗣嘟囔着，"好吧，我来干。加持，你去接货吧。

Kaji smiled and nodded, leaving the room as well.
加持微笑着点了点头，也离开了房间。

"Delivery?" Asuka shot a questioning look at Misato, "what do they need to deliver here for?"
接货？" 明日香投去一个疑惑的眼神，"这里有什么东西需要他们送来？

"It's about your special training…" Misato waved her hand, gesturing Shinji and Asuka to follow her, "come with me, I'll explain once we get there…"
是关于你们的特殊训练……" 碇真嗣挥了挥手，示意真嗣和明日香跟上，"跟我来，到了地方我再解释……

The trio walked in silence in the hallway as they approached the living quarters. Misato led the confused Children to the front of a door, using her keycard to slid it across the slot on the lock. The door hissed open, revealing a rather clean and big room with two single beds, and a DDR machine at the corner.
三人默默地走在走廊上，向居住区靠近。葛城美里领着困惑的孩子们来到一扇门前，用她的门卡在锁槽上刷过。门嘶嘶作响地打开，露出一个相当整洁宽敞的房间，里面有两张单人床，角落里还放着一台 DDR 跳舞机。

They Children exchanged a confused look. "So," Misato started with a grin that was too familiar to both Shinji and Asuka, "you two will be living here together for the next five days."
孩子们交换了一个困惑的眼神。“那么，”葛城美里带着一种对真嗣和明日香来说过于熟悉的笑容开口道，“接下来的五天，你们俩将一起住在这里。”

"WHAT?!" Shinji and Asuka shouted in unison, but for different yet similar reasons. "THERE IS NO WAY I'M LIVING WITH HIM!"
“什么？！”真嗣和明日香异口同声地喊道，尽管原因各异却又相似。“我绝不可能和他住在一起！”

"Asuka!" Misato said forcefully, "not just living together, but also eating together, training together, sleeping together…in short, everything you do, both of you will participate! Well, except bathing, that is."
“明日香！”葛城美里强硬地说，“不只是住在一起，还要一起吃饭、一起训练、一起睡觉……简而言之，你们俩要参与所有活动！哦，除了洗澡之外。”

"WHY?" 为什么？

"Because we need you guys synchronized!" Misato explained, "you need to synchronize your thoughts, or you will fail again in the next test! And Commander Ikari will not tolerate repeated failure!"
因为我们得让你们同步！" 葛城解释道，"你们需要同步思维，否则下次测试还会失败！而碇司令是不会容忍一再失败的！

"But what if this pervert tries something during the night?!" Asuka took an involuntary step away.
"可万一这变态夜里动手动脚怎么办？！" 明日香不由自主地后退了一步。

"C'mon, I know you'll kill me if I try anything…" Shinji said dejectedly.
"得了吧，我知道我要是敢乱来，你肯定会宰了我……" 真嗣沮丧地说。

"Hmph, I suppose you know your place!"
哼，看来你还是知道自己的位置的！

"No objections? Not that I'll take them anyway," Misato started walking towards the door, "Kaji will explain the training to you after he comes back with the…stuff, before that, behave yourselves. Dinner serves from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m." Misato added, exiting the room, "don't kill each other!"
没有异议吗？反正我也不会听的，" 美里边说边向门口走去，"等卡吉回来带回那些……东西后，他会向你们解释训练的事。在那之前，都给我老实点。晚餐供应时间是下午 5 点到 7 点。" 美里补充道，随即离开了房间，"别互相残杀了！

Asuka shot a threatening glare at Shinji, who immediately slumped and ready to escape. Seeing his reaction, Asuka initially felt content since she had power over him, but soon another feeling crept up in her mind – she felt sick at his submissiveness. Asuka liked it when he was pushing back – it was more interesting that way.
明日香向真嗣投去一个威胁的眼神，后者立刻萎靡不振，准备逃离。看到他的反应，明日香起初感到满意，因为她能掌控他，但很快另一种感觉涌上心头——她对他的顺从感到恶心。明日香更喜欢他反抗的时候——那样更有趣。

"Here, put this on right now."
快，现在就把这个穿上。

Asuka tried to look as menacing as she could at Kaji, but her age and height against someone masculine and broad-shouldered like Kaji… "No! I'm not like Shinji! I'm not wearing this stupid outfit!"
明日香试图对加持展现出她所能有的最凶狠的表情，但面对加持这样身材魁梧、肩膀宽阔的男性，她的年龄和身高实在难以构成威胁……"不！我跟真嗣不一样！我才不要穿这蠢衣服！"

Shinji stared at Asuka. He was already wearing the ludicrous 'synch outfit', a clashing ensemble of black spandex shorts and a loose-fitting top that threatened to fall off the shoulders. Knowing Misato, Asuka could imagine her hysterical laughter once she sees them. She must've done this for revenge against the hell brought to her by Asuka.
真嗣盯着明日香。他早已穿上了那套荒唐的"同步服"，一套黑紧身短裤搭配宽松上衣的组合，那上衣似乎随时都会从肩上滑落。想到美里，明日香可以想象到她看到他们时会爆发出的狂笑。这肯定是美里为了报复明日香给她带来的麻烦而故意安排的。

"Asuka, you will put this on willingly, or do you want our lovely Shinji to put it on for you?" Kaji said with a sly grin.
"明日香，你是自愿穿上这个，还是想让我们的可爱真嗣帮你穿上呢？" 加持带着狡黠的笑容说道。

Apparently Asuka was not used to Kaji acting like this to her. She recoiled and gave him a hateful look. Shinji even got to his feet and glared at his guardian. "N-now, Kaji-san, you can't mean such things!" He blushed helplessly as certain images crept up to his mind.
显然，明日香不习惯卡兹这样对她。她退缩了，用憎恨的眼神看着他。连真嗣也站了起来，怒视着他的监护人。“那、那个，卡兹先生，你不能这么说！”他无助地脸红，某些画面悄然浮现在脑海中。

"So what's it going to be, Asuka?"
“那么，明日香，你打算怎么办？”

"You know, this has to be some form of child abuse!" Asuka insisted, "This is banned by Geneva Conventions! I'll have to report this to-"
“你知道吗，这肯定是某种形式的虐待儿童！”明日香坚持说，“日内瓦公约都禁止这种行为！我得向——”

"It was approved by the Commander himself." Kaji interrupted with a smug look.
“这是指挥官亲自批准的。”卡兹打断她，脸上带着得意的表情。

"Fa-he did?" Shinji almost slip-tongued.
"法-他真的做了？" 真嗣差点咬到舌头。

"Yes. Just give it up Asuka. You'll make the next five days unbearable if you act like this."
是的。放弃吧，明日香。如果你这样下去，接下来的五天会很难熬。

Asuka glanced at the clock. After Kaji briefed them about the training routines, they had been arguing for about half an hour on this subject alone. In total, Kaji took what seemed like hours to explain the special training to the Children. The time was now 00:07. In the morning.
明日香瞥了一眼时钟。自从加持简述了训练日程后，他们就这个话题已经争论了大约半小时。总体上，加持花了好几个小时向孩子们解释这次特殊训练。现在的时间是凌晨 00:07。

Asuka cursed internally in frustration. She thought she could wear him down. She thought he'd be finished with her mouth after the first hour. Apparently, Kaji could last longer than she expected. Not that she wouldn't expect it with the Kaji she knew.
明日香内心咒骂着，感到挫败。她本以为能让他屈服。她以为他会在第一个小时后就对她无话可说。显然，加持比她预想的要持久。倒也不是说她不了解那个她所认识的加持。

Asuka growled and snatched the outfit out of Kaji's outstretched hand. He smirked in triumph.
明日香低吼一声，从加持伸出的手中夺过衣服。他得意地笑了。

"Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves," Kaji flashed the Children a thumbs up and slid the door to the hallway open. "Don't do anything I wouldn't approve during the night, okay?"
好了，我就不打扰你们俩了，"加持向孩子们竖起大拇指，推开通往走廊的门。"晚上别做我不会批准的事，好吗？

"I would only dream of it…" Shinji murmured, but not unnoticed by Asuka. "What was that?!"
我只会梦到它……" 真嗣喃喃自语，但没逃过明日香的耳朵。"你说什么?!

"I said I wouldn't even dream of it," he quickly corrected himself.
"我说我连梦都不会梦到，"他赶紧纠正自己。

"Hmph, that's what I thought!"
哼，我就知道是这样！

"Don't forget, I'm living just next door. Don't hesitate to reach me if you get into any trouble. Alright?" Kaji reminded them once again, his body already out of the room.
"别忘了，我就住在隔壁。遇到麻烦随时找我，好吗？" 卡吉再次提醒道，此时他的身体已经离开了房间。

"Hai." "Yeah, yeah." 嗯。" "知道啦，知道啦。

The door clicked shut. "So what do we do now?" Asuka asked dryly.
门咔哒一声关上了。"那我们现在怎么办？" 明日香干巴巴地问道。

Shinji stood between the beds with his arms crossed. "You put on that…thing, and then we go to sleep." They stood there and looked at each other for a moment. They both couldn't believe the situation they were in. They felt lost. For completely different reasons, this time.
真嗣双臂交叉站在床间，说道：“你穿上那……东西，然后我们就睡觉。”他们站在那里，对视了一会儿。两人都无法相信自己所处的境地。他们感到迷茫。这次，出于完全不同的原因。

However, there was an unspoken familiarity to all of this.
然而，这一切中却有一种不言而喻的熟悉感。

"Stop staring at me like that, it makes me uncomfortable," Asuka said, half to herself. Shinji averted his eyes to the ground and headed towards his bed.
“别那样盯着我看，让我很不舒服，”明日香半自言自语地说。真嗣将目光移向地面，朝自己的床走去。

"You can go to sleep for all I care, but I'm going to take a shower first." Asuka stated with an unreadable expression, "don't try to peek!"
“你尽管去睡，我可要先洗个澡。”明日香面无表情地声明，“别想偷看！”

"It's not something worth my life…" Shinji just couldn't help but retort.
"这不值得我拿命去拼……" 真嗣忍不住反驳道。

"What did you say?!" Asuka was more surprised than angry – one thing she knew too well was her charm. No male could resist her charms ever before – well, except Kaji – the perverted looks they gave her made her cringe. Although it was flattering at first, it quickly started making her feel sick.
"你说什么?!" 明日香与其说是愤怒，不如说是惊讶——她对自己的魅力再清楚不过。从未有男性能抵挡她的魅力——好吧，除了加持先生——那些色眯眯的眼神让她恶心。虽然一开始还挺受用的，但很快就让她感到反胃。

"N-nothing!" Shinji hastily said, "just…do whatever you want to do and be quick! I really want to sleep right now…"
没、没什么！" 真嗣急忙说，"只是……你想做什么就快点做吧！我现在真的很想睡觉……

Asuka looked at him with an incredulous glare. 'He's not being...irritated, just...tired.' she thought. "Fine," Asuka muttered, entering the bathroom.
明日香用难以置信的眼神盯着他。'他不是在……生气，只是……累了。' 她想。"好吧，" 明日香嘟囔着，走进了浴室。

The warm flow of water did little to soothe her thoughts. She was forced to live with a boy. For five days. Although it could act as a distraction since she was suspended from school - and a quick explanation to Misato avoided a tongue-lash, she still thought better ways to spend her spare time.
温热的水流并未能抚慰她的思绪。她被迫与一个男孩同住。整整五天。虽然这能作为她被停学期间的一种消遣——而且迅速向美里解释一番也免去了责骂，但她仍觉得有更好的方式来打发空闲时间。

Thinking back to Shinji - well, she had to admit, he was probably the best choice if she was given a choice. They knew each other, they work together - hell, they were both EVA pilots! And he wasn't as much a pervert as she initially thought.
回想起真嗣——好吧，她不得不承认，如果非得选择一个人同住，他或许是最好的选择。他们彼此认识，一起工作——说到底，他们都是 EVA 驾驶员！而且，他并不像她最初认为的那样是个色狼。

Only with the prerequisite that there was no rejecting the idea of living with a boy in the first place.
前提是，她无法拒绝与男孩同住这一事实。

If she had to live with him, then she might as well test his boundaries and manners.
既然必须与他同住，那她不妨试试他的底线和礼节。

Having devised a perfect plan, Asuka grinning devilishly and picked up her pace of showering. If he went asleep because of her prolonged bathing session, then her plan wouldn't have any purpose.
制定了一个完美的计划后，明日香邪魅地一笑，加快了洗澡的速度。如果他因为她的长时间沐浴而睡着，那么她的计划就失去了意义。

Asuka dried her body but left the hair wet, put on a sleeveless vest that wipes her chest and short shorts, and wrapped herself with a dry towel, completely blocking her clothes. She walked out of the bathroom seductively, happy to find Shinji still reading manga, paying zero attention to her presence. Asuka composed herself, questioning again why she was doing this. She wanted to test him - if he failed the first one, then she would know how to treat him for the rest of their training session.
明日香擦干了身体，却让头发保持湿润，穿上了一件无袖背心，隐约露出胸部，搭配短裤，并用干毛巾将自己裹得严严实实，完全遮住了衣物。她妖娆地走出浴室，欣喜地发现真嗣仍在专心阅读漫画，对她视而不见。明日香调整了一下情绪，再次自问为何要这么做。她想考验他——如果他第一次就失败了，那么她就知道在接下来的训练中该如何对待他了。

"So Shinji," Asuka grinning internally as she captured his attention and saw his eyes were about to bulge out in surprise, "what do you think of my body?"
“那么，真嗣，”明日香内心窃笑，成功吸引了他的注意，看到他惊讶得眼珠子都快瞪出来了，“你觉得我的身材怎么样？”

"A-A-Asuka, p-p-put some clothes on!" Shinji stammered, his face blushing, his hands raised in front of him in a futile attempt to block his vision.
“明、明、明日香，快、快、快穿上衣服！”真嗣结结巴巴地说，脸颊泛红，双手举在面前，徒劳地试图遮挡视线。

"What?" Asuka said, half-dejected, half-surprised. She decided to push further. "Don't you like it? My chest is very big..." She started to slid the towel down.
"什么？" 明日香说道，半是沮丧，半是惊讶。她决定再试探一下。"你不喜欢吗？我的胸部很大……" 她开始往下拉毛巾。

"A-Asuka! Please!" Shinji pleaded, already falling down from the bed, "D-don't-"
明、明日香！请别这样！" 真嗣恳求道，已经从床上跌落下来，"不、不要——

"Hahahahahaha!" Asuka took off the towel, revealing her clothes under it, and started laughing helplessly. "The look on your face...hahahaha!" She was rolling on the floor.
"哈哈哈哈哈哈！" 明日香扯掉毛巾，露出底下的衣服，开始无助地大笑。"你那表情……哈哈哈！" 她在地上打滚。

Shinji let out a breath he didn't know he was holding, "Asuka...Misato has a camera installed in the room...she might be watching for all I know..."
真嗣吐出了一口他未曾察觉自己一直憋着的气，"明日香……美里在房间里装了摄像头……她可能正在看，谁知道呢……"

"WHAT?!" Asuka jumped up and turned into a defensive posture. She scanned around the room, and located the security camera mounted on the ceiling. "Scheisse! Baka, why didn't you tell me?!"
什么?!" 明日香猛地跳起来，摆出防御姿势。她环顾房间，发现了安装在天花板上的监控摄像头。"该死！笨蛋，你怎么不早告诉我?!

"I thought a genius like you would've figured it out yourself, don't you think?" Shinji retorted in both tiredness and amusement - it was the first time he was getting under Asuka's skin. Well, the first time he could remember.
"我以为像你这样的天才应该自己能发现呢，你不觉得吗？" 真嗣带着疲惫和一丝戏谑反驳道——这是他第一次让明日香感到不快。嗯，至少是他记得的第一次。

Asuka huffed and turned around, trying to hide her unreasonable blush. She turned off the lights and climbed up her bed. Although her plan backfired, it still yielded satisfactory results - Shinji was not a pervert she thought he was, and that single trait had already put him one level above all other boys at his age. Asuka decided he was at the tire of 'tolerable'. "It's going to be a long five days..."
明日香哼了一声，转过身去，试图掩饰自己无端的脸红。她关掉灯，爬上自己的床。虽然计划适得其反，但结果还算令人满意——真嗣并非她想象中的那种变态，仅这一点就让他比同龄的其他男孩高出一筹。明日香决定将他归为“勉强能忍受”的范畴。"接下来的五天可不好过啊……"

"You're telling me..." Shinji muttered, drifting to sleep.
"你说得对……" 真嗣喃喃自语，渐渐进入梦乡。

### Chapter 5: Momentarily United Minds Pt2
短暂的心灵相通 第二部分

Breakfast consisted of some scrambled eggs, two slices of bacon for both Asuka and Shinji, and two hash browns. The Children sat across the dining table in the cafeteria, biting the bullet as they swallowed the de facto plastic and rubber. What's worse, the juice supply was in shortage today. Shinji grumbled in annoyance; he decided to ask Kaji later to let him cook their own food. "I… don't like the bacon," he sighed, "too much grease."
早餐是一些炒鸡蛋，两片培根给明日香和真嗣，还有两个土豆煎饼。孩子们坐在食堂餐桌对面，硬着头皮吞下那实质上的塑料和橡胶。更糟糕的是，今天果汁供应不足。真嗣恼火地嘟囔着；他决定稍后找加持让他自己做饭。“我…不喜欢这培根，”他叹气道，“太油腻了。”

"Well, I hate the hash brown, too little grease," Asuka retorted, not sure intentional or sincere. Initially, they were told to feed each other using chopsticks – the idea was shot down since neither of the Children was willing to comply.
“哼，我也不喜欢土豆煎饼，油太少了，”明日香反驳道，不知是故意还是真心。起初，他们被告知要用筷子互相喂食——这个主意因为两个孩子都不愿意配合而被否决了。

However, they still had to wash the dishes together. Asuka threw one of the plates on the ground in frustration, shattering it into pieces. Shinji simply looked at her with dread, subconsciously taking a step away from her. 'Even if we do have a chance, will I be able to survive staying with her? I guess I did…if whatever the prophesier told me is true,' Shinji mused as he washed the plates on autopilot, 'is it really worth it if she always acts like this, even in a relationship?'
然而，他们还是得一起洗碗。明日香一气之下将一个盘子摔在地上，碎片四溅。真嗣只是惊恐地看着她，下意识地往后退了一步。'即便我们真有机会，我能忍受和她在一起吗？或许吧……如果预言者所言非虚的话，' 真嗣机械地洗着盘子，心中暗想，'如果她总是这样，哪怕是在恋爱中，这一切真的值得吗？'

"What are you brooding on?" Asuka's plain voice broke Shinji from his train of thought, "you've been washing the same plate for a minute now."
你在琢磨什么呢？" 明日香平淡的声音打断了真嗣的思绪，"你已经洗同一个盘子洗了一分钟了。

"Huh? Ah!" Shinji almost dropped the plate, catching it just in time, "I-I zoned out there, sorry."
啊？哦！" 真嗣差点没拿住盘子，及时抓住了，"我……我走神了，抱歉。

"Hm," Asuka narrowed her eyes in suspicion, "surely you weren't just slacking off!"
哼，" 明日香眯起眼睛，满是怀疑，"你肯定不是在偷懒吧！

"N-no, of course not," Shinji hastily denied; he squashed another apology and came up with a perfect retort, "still, I washed more plates than you!"
不，当然不是，" 真嗣急忙否认；他压下又一次道歉的冲动，想出了一个完美的反驳，"再说，我洗的盘子比你多！

Asuka blinked in surprise at his push back – her pride was damaged since apparently Shinji was indicating that she did a worse job than him. She glared at him dangerously, "Are you implying…you are better than me?"
明日香惊讶地眨了眨眼，他的反驳让她自尊受损——显然真嗣在暗示她做得不如他好。她危险地瞪着他，"你是在暗示……你比我强吗？"

Shinji gulped, "Wh-what? I-" "Hello kids!" Misato's cheerful voice saved him from some potential physical contact as both of them turned their attention to the lavender-haired woman, "how's everything been going?"
真嗣咽了口唾沫，"什-什么？我-" "孩子们好啊！" 美里欢快的声音救了他，免去了可能的肢体冲突，两人都把注意力转向了这位紫发女子，"最近怎么样？"

"Great," Asuka said sarcastically, "being a top-secret test subject and fed garbage."
好极了，" 明日香讽刺地说，"作为顶级机密试验品，吃着垃圾食品。

"Now Asuka, you know we can't let civilians into the Geofront, so takeout is not an option," Misato explained, "unless you want to cook – or try some of my newest dishes!" She added with a grin.
"现在，明日香，你知道我们不能让平民进入 Geofront，所以外卖是不可能的，" 葛城解释道，"除非你想自己做饭——或者尝尝我的新菜式！" 她笑着补充道。

Asuka visibly paled while Shinji shot her an empathetic look. "No thanks," she huffed, "I'd rather starve!"
明日香明显脸色一白，而真嗣则向她投去同情的目光。"不用了，" 她气呼呼地说，"我宁愿饿着！"

"Actually," Shinji started, "I can cook some dishes-"
其实，" 真嗣开口道，"我会做几道菜——

He was cut off by Asuka, "Oh yeah! I remembered, you make your own bentos every day," she clapped her hands together in anticipation, "I mean, whatever you make will be definitely better than the junk we are eating now!"
话还没说完，就被明日香打断了，"哦对！我想起来了，你每天都自己带便当，" 她兴奋地拍手，"我是说，不管你做什么，肯定比我们现在吃的垃圾好多了！"

"Aw, trying to impress girls with cooking?" Misato winked, "what else can girls want?"
哎呀，想用做饭来吸引女孩子吗？" 美里眨了眨眼，"女孩子还能想要什么呢？

Shinji blushed, stammering incoherent words. Asuka cut in, "Gott you're so immature! It's just convenient, nothing more!"
真嗣脸红了，结结巴巴地说不出话来。明日香插话道："天啊，你真幼稚！这只是图个方便，没别的！"

To her surprise Shinji seemed relieved and smiled a small smile, "Well, as long as I have the ingredients…"
令她意外的是，真嗣似乎松了口气，微微一笑，"嗯，只要有食材就行……"

"Don't worry, I'm sure you can find everything you need in the kitchen," Misato reassured, "I'll go and negotiate with the staff there!" She left with a wave of hand.
"别担心，我相信厨房里你能找到所有需要的东西，" 美里安慰道，"我去和那里的工作人员沟通一下！" 她挥了挥手离开了。

Making sure Misato was out of hearing range, Shinji sighed, "Asuka…is she always acting like this?"
确认了美里听不到后，真嗣叹了口气，“明日香…她总是这样吗？”

Asuka huffed, "Yeah! It's so annoying! How can somebody as old as her so childish?"
明日香哼了一声，“对啊！真烦人！她这么大年纪了怎么还这么幼稚？”

"Well, that's Misato for you…"
“嗯，这就是美里…”

"Wait, you know her before?" Asuka asked, surprised.
“等等，你之前就认识她？”明日香惊讶地问道。

"Yeah, I lived with her…not this one, but someone looked and acted like her when I was an EVA pilot…" Shinji explained, "it seems she hasn't changed at all…"
嗯，我和她一起生活过……不是这个她，而是当我还是 EVA 驾驶员时，有个长得和行为都像她的人……" 真嗣解释道，"看起来她一点都没变……

"Huh, ain't that interesting," Asuka rubbed her chin, musing. 'I remember living with her…before, and with a boy as well… I'm afraid that…'
"哈，真有意思，" 明日香摸着下巴沉思，'我记得以前也和她一起生活过……还有个男孩……恐怕……'

"What's wrong?" Shinji asked.
"怎么了？" 真嗣问道。

"Nothing," Asuka decided to ask Shinji about this later, "let's get back to our training!"
没什么，" 明日香决定稍后再向真嗣询问此事，"我们继续训练吧！

XXXXXX

"I need to go to the bathroom," Shinji said after one hour of fitness training. Shinji and Asuka didn't know why they were required to do it – dancing and sitting in entry plugs didn't necessarily require strong muscles. Misato smiled, "you can go now, Shinji." He nodded and went to the only bathroom in the room. "Now Asuka," Misato continued, "you need to stand outside the open bathroom door."
我要去洗手间，" 真嗣在健身训练一小时后说道。真嗣和明日香不明白为什么他们需要这么做——跳舞和坐在插入栓里并不一定需要强壮的肌肉。美里微笑着说："你现在可以去，真嗣。" 他点点头，走向房间里唯一的洗手间。"现在轮到你了，明日香，" 美里继续说，"你需要站在敞开的洗手间门外。

"WHAT?!" Asuka shouted, not believing what she thought she had heard, "are you fucking insane?"
什么？！" 明日香大喊，不敢相信自己所听到的，"你是不是疯了？

Even Shinji was embarrassed, "M-Misato-san, you can't mean such things!"
连真嗣也感到尴尬，"美里小姐，你不能这么说的！"

"What," Misato said in an innocent voice, "I just need you to stand there, nothing more."
怎么了，" 美里用无辜的声音说，"我只是需要你站在那里，没别的。

Shinji sighed and proceeded to the bathroom while Asuka grumbled some German curses, walking to the bathroom as well. She stood with her hands over her ears, and her eyes screwed shut.
真嗣叹了口气，走向浴室，而明日香则嘟囔着几句德语咒骂，也朝浴室走去。她站在那里，双手捂着耳朵，双眼紧闭。

"He's finished. You can stop acting now." Misato tapped Asuka's shoulder.
"他完事了。你可以不用装了。" 美里轻拍了拍明日香的肩膀。

"What?!" Asuka poked Misato on her stomach, "are you implying that I was watching or hearing any of that?"
什么？！" 明日香戳了戳美里的肚子，"你是在暗示我刚才在看或听那些吗？

"I wasn't implying anything." Misato suppressed a grin.
"我可没暗示什么。" 美里强忍着笑意。

Shinji looked very much embarrassed. It was harder for him than it was for Asuka. "What do we do now, Misato?"
真嗣显得非常尴尬。对他来说，这比对明日香更难。“我们现在怎么办，美里？”

"Yeah, great almighty leader. What is your all-knowing judgment?"
“是啊，伟大的领袖。您无所不知的判断是什么？”

Misato seemed to contemplate this and put her fingers underneath her chin. Asuka and Shinji exchanged glances; they knew nothing good she was up to. "Before I leave, I want you two to hold hands."
美里似乎在深思，将手指放在下巴下。明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神；他们知道她没安好心。“在我离开之前，我希望你们两个能牵手。”

"What did you say?" "What the hell?!"
“你说什么？”“搞什么鬼？！”

Misato clapped her hands together, "Just kidding." A sly grin appeared on her face.
碇真嗣拍了拍手，“开个玩笑。”她脸上露出一丝狡黠的笑容。

"Misato…" Asuka growled, "that isn't funny."
“碇真嗣…”明日香低吼道，“这一点也不好笑。”

To Asuka's surprise, Shinji seemed indifferent to this. Of course she had no way to know it was because Shinji had known that they already did something debauchery. Asuka glared at him, who immediately averted his eyes.
令明日香惊讶的是，真嗣对此似乎无动于衷。当然，她无从得知这是因为真嗣早已知晓他们曾有过放纵的行为。明日香瞪了他一眼，他立刻移开了视线。

"Alright guys, let's get into the business here," Misato switched to a serious tone, handing the Children a small black box that looked like a cassette player with two sets of headphones, "this is an SDAT player with a slight modification. You are to wear it all the time unless I tell you otherwise."
“好了，各位，我们言归正传，”碇真嗣换上严肃的语气，递给孩子们一个看似带有两副耳机的磁带播放器的小黑盒子，“这是经过轻微改装的 SDAT 播放器。除非我另有指示，否则你们必须一直佩戴着它。”

Shinji and Asuka put on their respective headphones, "It doesn't feel any different from my old player," Shinji commented.
真嗣和明日香各自戴上耳机，“感觉和我的旧播放器没什么两样，”真嗣评论道。

"Turn on the switch," Misato said, "it's on the left side of your headphones."
“打开开关，”美里说，“就在你耳机的左侧。”

The Children did the same, and they both heard a high-pitched ringing in their ears. Both of them flinched, "What is this, Misato?" They asked in perfect sync; surprised, they turned their heads to each other and scratched their own heads. In perfect sync. "Misato!" They exclaimed. "What is this doing to us?!"
两人照做，随即耳中传来一阵尖锐的鸣响。他们同时一缩，“这是什么，美里？”他们异口同声地问道；惊讶之余，两人转头看向对方，又同步地挠了挠自己的头。“美里！”他们齐声喊道，“这东西对我们做了什么？！”

"There's a special chip inside that monitors brain waves in… what's it called…the area of your brain that controls speech and motor movements," Misato explained.
“里面装有一个特殊芯片，能监测大脑中……叫什么来着……控制语言和运动功能区域的脑波，”美里解释道。

"You mean the cerebrum and temporal lobe?" The Children said, and they looked at each other. They couldn't tell who's thought it was.
"你是说大脑和颞叶吗？"孩子们说道，他们互相看着对方。他们无法分辨这是谁的想法。

Misato laughed uneasily, "yeah, I wasn't really paying attention when Naoko explained to me…but it probes your brain waves; half of what you do and half of what you do merge together so you two will act as one," Asuka showed a skeptical face, "or something like that."
美里不安地笑了笑，"嗯，直子向我解释的时候我并没有太注意……但它会探测你的脑电波；你的一半行为和你的一半行为融合在一起，这样你们两个就会行动一致，"明日香露出怀疑的表情，"大概就是这样。"

"Does this mean he can read my thoughts?" Shinji and Asuka both said, and now it was clear who was the dominant one. Asuka smirked proudly while Shinji mirrored it.
"这是否意味着他能读取我的想法？"真嗣和明日香同时说道，现在很明显谁是主导者。明日香得意地笑了笑，而真嗣也跟着笑了。

"No, it can't read thought. It only obeys impulses from both of you. Once a happy medium is reached, then you two will act on it." Misato stepped in, "and Shinji, you can't just let Asuka take over the control!"
不，它不能读取思想。它只服从你们两个人的冲动。一旦达到一个愉快的平衡点，你们两个就会根据它行动。"美里插话说，"还有，真嗣，你不能让明日香完全控制！

They both took off the headphones, "So, it seems like I'm the superior one, after all," Asuka boasted, giving Shinji a sideways glance, "if I willingly slap my face, would he slap himself?"
两人摘下耳机，“看来，终究还是我更胜一筹，”明日香自夸道，斜眼瞥了真嗣一眼，“如果我自愿打自己脸，他会打自己吗？”

Shinji gulped, "well, when are we supposed to wear this?" He wasn't a bit amused by Asuka.
真嗣咽了口唾沫，“那我们什么时候该戴上这个？”他对明日香丝毫不觉得有趣。

"You wear it when you're not sleeping or taking a shower," Misato ignored her comment, "however, I do prefer you two to hold actual conversations. Synchronization stems from understanding the person standing next to you. Talking to each other is better for harmony than using this chip. Also, the music you'll be dancing with is also on the tape. Familiarize yourself with it before I come back!"
“除了睡觉和洗澡的时候都戴着，”美里无视了她的评论，“不过，我更希望你们俩能进行真正的对话。同步源于理解站在你身边的人。互相交谈比使用这个芯片更有助于和谐。还有，你们要配合的音乐也在磁带上。在我回来之前，先熟悉一下！”

Asuka huffed, not acknowledging Misato's suggestion. "Alright, I'll leave you guys by yourselves. Remember, I'm watching your every move," Misato said cryptically, "I'll return before sundown and check your progress!" She then left the room. The door clicked shut, leaving Asuka and Shinji in awkward silence.
明日香哼了一声，对美里的建议不予理会。“好了，我让你们俩单独待着。记住，我可是在盯着你们的一举一动，”美里神秘地说，“我会在日落前回来检查你们的进展！”说完，她离开了房间。门咔哒一声关上，留下明日香和真嗣在尴尬的沉默中。

"Well, better get started…" Shinji broke the silence, putting on the headphones, "do you?"
嗯，还是开始吧……" 真嗣打破了沉默，戴上耳机，"你呢？

"Whatever," Asuka said, putting on the headphones as well, "might as well get this over with."
随便吧，" 明日香也戴上了耳机，"反正早点结束也好。

The music sounded – it gave both Shinji and Asuka a strong feeling of déjà vu, but none could place it. They felt they've listened to this before. The Children simultaneously turned their heads to each other – not entirely under the influence of the chip – and gave confused frowns. They both shrugged, shaking the thought off.
音乐响起——给真嗣和明日香一种强烈的似曾相识感，但谁也说不上来。他们觉得自己以前听过这曲子。两位少年不约而同地转头看向对方——不完全受芯片影响——露出困惑的皱眉。两人耸了耸肩，将这念头抛诸脑后。

Lunchtime came rather quickly. The Children spent hours just listening to the SDAT while avoiding talking, both immersed in their own thoughts. Shinji took off his headphones, "I'm going to the kitchen," he stood up, stretching his limbs, "lunch will be ready in…well, do you want any specific dishes?"
午餐时间很快就到了。孩子们花了好几个小时只是听着 SDAT，避免交谈，各自沉浸在自己的思绪中。真嗣摘下耳机，"我去厨房，" 他站起身，伸展四肢，"午饭快好了……嗯，你想吃点什么特别的吗？"

Asuka wasn't expecting him to care about her taste – she shook it off, thinking it's just him not knowing what to cook. "Anything is fine for me, as long as it's cooked," she said, picking up her manga and began reading.
明日香没想到他会关心自己的口味——她摇了摇头，心想他只是不知道该做什么菜而已。“我什么都行，只要做熟了就好。”她说着，拿起漫画开始阅读。

"Alright then." Shinji left the room and headed towards the Geofront kitchen. True to Misato's words, the kitchen was big, and it indeed contained everything Shinji needed. Just as he wandered around the food storage, a familiar irritated voice called out to him, making Shinji flinch, "Baka-Shinji! Where the hell is you!?"
“那好吧。”真嗣离开房间，朝地底都市的厨房走去。正如美里所说，厨房很大，确实应有尽有。正当他在食品储藏室里徘徊时，一个熟悉的恼怒声音喊住了他，让真嗣不禁一缩，“笨蛋真嗣！你死哪儿去了！？”

Shinji swallowed; he didn't know what he did to irritate Asuka – perhaps it was because of what he didn't do. He walked out of the storage room into the kitchen, finding an angry redhead stomping around, "Asuka! I'm here." He called out, capturing her attention, "what are you doing here?"
真嗣咽了口唾沫；他不知道自己做了什么惹恼了明日香——或许是因为他没做什么。他走出储藏室来到厨房，只见一个怒气冲冲的红发少女来回踱步，“明日香！我在这儿。”他喊道，吸引了她的注意，“你来这儿干嘛？”

Asuka crossed her arms around her chest, "What do you think? Misato said I have to do everything with you, including cooking!" She huffed in annoyance, suddenly a devilish grin appeared on her face, "since you wasted my precious time to find you, as payback you'll do the all the cooking and washing the plates! While me, the generous Asuka La-Shikinami, will help you wash the vegetables. Sounds fair?" Although it was a question, Asuka's intense glare denied any possible reply other than agreement.
明日香双臂环抱胸前，“你怎么看？美里说我得跟你一起做所有事，包括做饭！”她气呼呼地说，突然脸上露出一抹狡黠的笑容，“既然你浪费了我宝贵的时间来找你，作为补偿，你得负责全部的烹饪和洗碗！而我，慷慨的明日香·兰格雷，会帮你洗菜。听起来公平吧？”虽是问句，但明日香那锐利的目光已不容许任何异议。

"Hai, Hai." Shinji sighed, wondering when they were in a relationship whether he was as whipped as he was right now. "I'm planning to make rice with meatballs today… I reckon you can find some cabbage for me? Wash and – if you can – cut them. I'll go deal with the meat."
“是，是。”真嗣叹了口气，思索着他们恋爱时自己是否也像现在这样言听计从。“我打算今天做肉丸子配米饭……你能帮我找些卷心菜吗？洗一下——如果可以的话——切好。我去处理肉。”

"Hmph, this should be easy," although Asuka didn't want to also cut the cabbage, but the way Shinji said it made it sounded like a challenge. The great Asuka Langley Soryu would never back away from challenges. "I'll show you how the real cook does it!"
“哼，这应该不难，”尽管明日香并不想连卷心菜也切，但真嗣的语气听起来像是在挑战。伟大的明日香·兰格雷·索西尔从不退缩于挑战。“我会让你见识真正的厨师是怎么做的！”

The Children split up to do their own stuff. Shinji quickly found the meat he needed and began marinating it with soy sauce and cooking wine. It was his first time – the first time he could remember for now – to cook something for the redhead whom God asked him to approach. Maybe he could…get closer to her with his cooking? Shinji sighed, still wondering how the former him tamed the devil without dying in the process.
孩子们各自忙活起来。真嗣迅速找到了所需的肉类，开始用酱油和料酒腌制。这是他第一次——至少是他现在能记得的第一次——为那位被神明指引他接近的红发女孩烹饪。或许，他可以通过烹饪……更接近她一些？真嗣叹了口气，仍在思索曾经的自己是如何在驯服恶魔的同时保住性命的。

Although Asuka was not good at the actual stirring and frying, her knowledge of handling vegetables was more than sufficient. She recalled her prog knife training, wielding the kitchen knife gracefully, cutting the cabbage into almost identical pieces. Maybe not the best way to deal with food, but it certainly demonstrated a sense of art.
尽管明日香不擅长翻炒，但她处理蔬菜的知识绰绰有余。她回忆起自己的专业刀法训练，优雅地挥动着菜刀，将卷心菜切成几乎一模一样的片。这或许不是处理食物的最佳方式，但无疑展现了一种艺术感。

Shinji was amazed. And he was supposed to be the more experienced cook.
真嗣感到惊讶。按理说，他应该是更有经验的厨师。

"Um, well," he stared at the ready-to-fry cabbage, not noticing the prideful look in Asuka's eyes, "I'm impressed."
嗯，这个嘛，"他盯着即将下锅的卷心菜，没注意到明日香眼中骄傲的神情，"我真是佩服。

Shinji didn't know how much better his simple words made Asuka feel. Asuka herself couldn't even figure out why. She was used to be praised by others, mainly by the boys who said she was gorgeous and hot. But none of them, even though their language was much more delicate, had made Asuka feel like this. She knew those praises were hollow with second thoughts behind them, but somehow, she knew Shinji's compliment was honest and sincere.
真嗣并不知道他简单的几句话让明日香感到多么舒心。就连明日香自己也不明白为什么。她习惯了被别人赞美，主要是那些称赞她美丽动人的男生。但即便他们的言辞更为精致，却从未让明日香有过这样的感觉。她知道那些赞美背后藏着虚伪，但不知怎的，她能感受到真嗣的夸奖是真诚的。

"Well, what do you expect from the great Asuka? I'm the prodigy, after all." She boasted, ego already reaching the ionosphere. She handed the cut cabbage to Shinji, who put it into the wok and began stirring. The meatballs were in the pan on the stove beside it. The savory smell and the sizzling sound of meat frying filled the kitchen. Asuka sniffed the air, "hmm, at least it smells not half bad."
哼，你还能期待从伟大的明日香这里得到什么？毕竟我可是天才。" 她自夸道，自信心已直冲电离层。她将切好的卷心菜递给真嗣，后者将其放入炒锅开始翻炒。肉丸则在旁边的炉子上煎着。厨房里弥漫着诱人的香味和肉煎炸的滋滋声。明日香闻了闻空气，"嗯，至少闻起来还不错。

Shinji blinked. Did Asuka just…praised him? That's a new one. Not that he unwelcomed it. "T-thanks, Asuka. I'm sure you'll like it more when eating them."
真嗣眨了眨眼。明日香刚才是在…夸他吗？这倒是新鲜事。他当然不会不欢迎。"谢…谢谢，明日香。我相信你吃的时候会更喜欢的。"

"It'd better be! I'm sick eating takeout and Misato's poisons," Asuka sighed, eliciting a chuckle from Shinji. She raised an eyebrow, "What is it, Third?"
最好是这样！我受够了外卖和美里姐的那些毒药，" 明日香叹了口气，引得真嗣轻笑。她挑了挑眉，"怎么了，第三适格者？

"It's just that, I told you I was living with her, right?" Shinji said, "I…was a victim, you could say…though I did nearly all the cooking later."
就是，我跟你说过我和她住在一起，对吧？" 真嗣说道，"我……可以说是受害者吧……虽然后来几乎都是我做饭。

Shinji's words reminded Asuka of something she wanted to ask him, "well, do you remember…living with me?"
真嗣的话让明日香想起了一个她想问他的问题，"那么，你还记得……和我一起住过吗？"

Shinji blinked; he didn't remember it, but he knew they were living together – it was the prophesier who implied such. "W-why do you ask that, Asuka?" His voice just a bit shaky, since he didn't know what Asuka would do if she remembered it was him who took her virginity – in their current state. He didn't even want to know.
真嗣眨了眨眼；他不记得了，但他知道他们曾同住——这是预言者暗示的。"你……你为什么这么问，明日香？" 他的声音略显颤抖，因为他不知道如果明日香记起是他夺走了她的初夜——在他们目前的状态下，她会作何反应。他甚至不愿去想。

"Because I remember living in Misato's when I was an EVA pilot…" Asuka looked at the ceiling, "and a boy was living with me. That's all I got. Now in retrospect, you're the most probable one." She intentionally left out the penguin incident.
"因为我还记得作为 EVA 驾驶员时住在美里家……" 明日香望着天花板，"还有一个男孩和我同住。我就记得这些。现在回想起来，你最有可能。" 她故意没提企鹅事件。

Shinji sighed in relief, "well, I don't particularly remember living with you, but I don't think they would kick me out just to put some random civilian in Misato's house, right?" Shinji suddenly came up with a perfect smokescreen, "unless…he was your boyfriend?"
真嗣松了口气，说道：“嗯，我倒是不太记得和你一起生活过，但我想他们总不会无缘无故把我赶出去，就为了让某个普通市民住进美里小姐家吧，对吧？”真嗣灵机一动，想出了一个绝妙的借口，“除非……他是你的男朋友？”

"What the hell are you implying by that?!" Asuka barked, "Not that I need a boyfriend in the first place! Even if by some cosmic fluke I did, I also remember giving him hell for seeing my glorious body! Why would I do that to my boyfriend?!"
“你这话是什么意思？！”明日香怒吼道，“首先，我根本不需要男朋友！就算真有什么宇宙奇迹让我有了，我也记得自己会因为他看到我这光辉的身体而让他吃尽苦头！我为什么要这样对待我的男朋友？！”

"I'm sure you won't…" Shinji kept a perfect poker face at her hypocritical statement.
“我相信你不会的……”面对她那虚伪的言论，真嗣保持着完美的扑克脸。

"Hmph," Asuka looked like she was thinking on something, "whatever. Hey," she pointed to the stove, "aren't you supposed to flip them?"
“哼，”明日香似乎在思考着什么，“随便吧。喂，”她指着炉子，“你不是应该翻一下它们吗？”

"Oh sorry!" Shinji rushed to the stove just in time to save his meatballs.
"哎呀，对不起！" 真嗣急忙冲向炉子，及时救下了他的肉丸。

"Alright, let's get this started." Misato started, indicating to the sheets in front of them. "This here is the choreography for the dance that you are going to practice. Got that?" She said, watching as Shinji and Asuka glanced at the pages in front of them. They contained sheet music, as well as movement diagrams for their dance routine that would follow. "You are going to need to memorize this by heart so we can get your rhythms going."
好了，我们开始吧。" 美里开口说道，示意面前的乐谱。"这是你们将要练习的舞蹈编排。明白了吗？" 她边说边观察着真嗣和明日香扫视面前的页面。上面不仅有乐谱，还有他们舞蹈动作的图解。"你们需要用心记住这些，以便我们能调整你们的节奏。

"So… we're going to be playing DDR?" Shinji asked, wondering just what the hell was actually happening. "Sure." Misato replied, "If you want to put it that way, but there's a reason for this." Misato said, immediately returning to business mode. "Now, apparently the simulator needs two minds to burden the sensory load. What we need from you two is perfect harmony from you both, so it is vital that you both learn to move in unison, speak in unison, all that stuff. This way you won't be fighting against each other's wills."
那么……我们要玩跳舞机吗？" 真嗣问道，心里纳闷这到底是怎么回事。"可以这么说。" 美里回答，"如果你非要这么理解的话，但这么做是有原因的。" 美里立刻切换回工作模式。"现在，显然模拟器需要两个大脑来分担感官负荷。我们需要你们两个达到完美的和谐，所以你们必须学会同步移动，同步说话，诸如此类。这样你们就不会相互对抗了。

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other in disbelief. "You want us to basically fuse our minds and bodies?" Asuka asked, wondering the lengths to which this plan was formed. "Basically, that's why we have chosen this melody," Misato said, holding up the music once again. "Memorising this movement pattern that I've formed will be the quickest way to master perfect harmony between you two. Using this melody, and these movements, we'll be able to nail it. Remember, we only have four days remaining."
真嗣和明日香难以置信地对视了一眼。"你是说，我们得几乎融合我们的思想和身体？"明日香问道，思索着这个计划到底有多极端。"基本上，这就是我们选择这首旋律的原因，"美里再次举起乐谱说道，"记住我设计的这个动作模式，将是你们两人迅速达到完美和谐的最快方式。借助这首旋律和这些动作，我们一定能成功。记住，我们只剩下四天时间了。"

"Indeed," Kaji suddenly entered the room, speaking to the Children, "It is essential that we get you two in harmony so that the next test could be carried out successfully. Don't worry so much about it! It won't be that hard." His eyes were still all on Misato, who was currently giving him a very noticeable frown.
"确实如此，"突然间，加持走进房间，对孩子们说道，"你们两人必须达到和谐，以便成功进行下一次测试。别太担心了！这不会太难的。"他的目光始终停留在美里身上，而美里此刻正明显地皱着眉头。

"What are you doing here!?" Misato said, placing her hands on her hips and staring the man down. "You know that I can do this myself?" She asked, crossing her arms in front of her.
"你来这里做什么！？"美里说着，双手叉腰，紧盯着那个男人。"你知道我自己能搞定吧？"她问道，双臂交叉在胸前。

"I'm hurt," Kaji replied, feigning being shot. "You shouldn't be so hard on me, Katsuragi." He said, giving her a charming grin. Misato growled, moving away from the man immediately and turning to the kids. "Alright you two. Get yourselves on the mats and we're going to give this a shot. We're only going to practice the first part. Now, here's the music, and let's give this a try." She said, moving towards the nearby boom box and inserting the disc, it didn't take long before the woman hit play, lighting up the room with a wondrous sound.
"我受伤了，" 加治回答道，假装中弹。"你别对我这么苛刻，葛城。" 他边说边向她投去一个迷人的微笑。 三佐咆哮一声，立刻从男人身边移开，转向孩子们。"好了，你们两个，上垫子，我们来试试这个。我们只练习第一部分。现在，音乐来了，我们试试看。" 她说着，走向旁边的音响，插入光盘，很快女人按下播放键，房间里顿时充满了美妙的旋律。

Shinji and Asuka nodded, immediately starting their routine. They started off quite well. Showing an understanding of the movements required. They leaned down forward, one hand on the ground, then raising themselves, that hand now raised high in the air. This was when the routine went south… Shinji started doing some weird, ballet-type movement, switching the raised hand around, then bringing them both down in a weird placement. Asuka, on the other hand, had tried to do a pirouette. Completely different from what Shinji was doing, ending up in a completely different ending position. With one knee raised between her arms. Misato and Kaji looked on in disbelief. Wondering just how the two children had managed to get out of sync so quickly. "Well… this could've been better," Kaji noted, his eyebrows raised in utter confusion.
真嗣和明日香点了点头，立刻开始了他们的日常训练。起初，他们表现得相当不错，对所需动作的理解也很到位。他们俯身向前，一只手撑地，随后起身，那只手高高举向空中。然而，就在这时，训练开始走样了……真嗣开始做一些奇怪的芭蕾式动作，变换着举起的手，然后以一种奇怪的方式将双手放下。另一方面，明日香尝试了一个单脚尖旋转，与真嗣的动作完全不同，最终落在一个截然不同的结束姿势，一条腿在双臂间抬起。美里和加持在一旁看得目瞪口呆，纳闷这两个孩子怎么这么快就完全不同步了。“嗯……这本可以做得更好，”加持评论道，眉头紧锁，一脸困惑。

"I thought this would be much easier." Misato muttered, staring between the continuing charade of doing what is absolutely not the same thing. "Seems like this will take up as much of our time as possible."
“我以为这会简单得多。”美里嘟囔着，目光在两人继续上演的完全不一致的闹剧中来回扫视。“看来这会尽可能地占用我们的时间。”

"This looks much more like a dance between a monkey and a crane." Kaji muttered, watching as Shinji fell over, landing hard on his back, in turn sending Asuka tumbling to the ground right on top of him. Asuka immediately started trying to hit him in annoyance. "Lots of our time," Misato muttered, staring at the clock on the wall.
"这看起来更像是一场猴子和鹤的舞蹈。" 加持低声说道，目睹着真嗣跌倒，重重地仰面摔在地上，紧接着又将明日香甩到他身上。明日香立刻恼怒地试图捶打他。"我们浪费了不少时间，" 美里喃喃自语，目光紧盯着墙上的时钟。

"Well, that was a great way to start training," Misato muttered, watching as Shinji and Asuka were very, very slowly trying their hardest to get anywhere. Unfortunately, this didn't get them very far, as the constant screw-ups were starting to get on both Children's nerves, this became more apparent as time went on. Quite frankly, Misato and Kaji were also getting very restless as well. They were expecting some kind of progression, but unfortunately due to the constant mess-ups, both kids were starting to get very annoyed, and that didn't help Misato at all. "Alright!" She finally said, raising her voice enough so she could be heard over the continued blaring of the music. "You two, take a break however you want. However, I don't want you two getting out of each other's sight, so go take a walk outside or something, get some dinner. Come back in two hours – I give you extra time for the ride in and out the Geofront, okay? We still have a lot of work to do." Misato then left the room, prompting the two Children to finally take a moment that wasn't constantly dancing to the same tune repeatedly.
"哎，这训练的开头可真不错。" 美里嘀咕着，看着真嗣和明日香费尽全力却进展缓慢。不幸的是，频繁的失误开始让两个孩子感到烦躁，随着时间的推移，这一点愈发明显。坦白说，美里和加持也变得焦躁不安。他们期待着有所进展，但不断的混乱让两个孩子越来越恼火，这对美里毫无帮助。"好了！" 她终于提高声音说道，以便在持续的音乐声中被听见。"你们俩，想怎么休息就怎么休息。但是，我不想你们离开对方的视线，所以出去散散步，或者吃点东西。两小时后回来——我给你们额外的时间来往于第三新东京市，好吗？我们还有很多工作要做。" 美里随即离开了房间，让两个孩子终于有机会从那不断重复的舞曲中抽身片刻。

Shinji and Asuka left the Geofront for the first time that day, an obvious annoyance hanging in the air between them. As soon as they were out of the building, Shinji started speaking, making his thoughts on the matter quite known. "Misato seriously expects us to keep doing this? Straight up, very first thing in the morning, three hours straight of constant training. Then the whole afternoon… I'm beat… We still have to do more after dinner…" Shinji muttered, running a hand through his sweaty hair.
那一天，真嗣和明日香首次离开第三新东京市的地底都市，两人之间明显弥漫着不悦的气氛。刚一踏出大楼，真嗣便开口了，毫不掩饰自己对此事的看法。“美里姐真的指望我们继续这样下去吗？一大早就开始，连续三个小时不间断的训练，然后整个下午……我都累垮了……晚饭后还得继续……”真嗣嘟囔着，用手拨弄着湿漉漉的头发。

Asuka grumbled slightly, "don't remind me…" Asuka muttered as she walked, her thoughts more primarily on the tasks they had just been doing. "This is just overly difficult because you're a klutz, Shinji!" Asuka said, a smirk on her face as she faced the boy. "We all know it would've already been perfect if we didn't have to try and synchronize our movements."
明日香略带抱怨地嘟囔了一句，“别提了……”她边走边说，心思更多地放在了他们刚刚完成的任务上。“这实在是太难了，都是因为你笨手笨脚，真嗣！”明日香说着，脸上露出一丝坏笑，转向男孩。“我们都知道，要不是得努力同步我们的动作，早就完美了。”

"Something that would only happen if we were doing it individually," Shinji noted, a small smile on his face. "But, we're doing it together, so we need to work together. Keep time together, instead of one person overtaking the other."
“那只有在各自独立操作时才可能发生，”真嗣回应道，脸上带着一丝微笑。“但我们是一起行动，所以需要协作。要同步节奏，而不是一个人超越另一个人。”

"Are you saying that I'm going too fast, Shinji?" Asuka asked innocently, giving the boy a small glare. "Are you implying that everything going wrong is my fault? You were the one who would fall and generally be a klutz. Why can't you just admit that you're the one that's dragging us down."
你是说我太快了吗，真嗣？" 明日香天真地问道，同时对男孩投去一瞥不满的目光。"你是在暗示这一切出错都是我的责任吗？明明是你自己老是摔倒，笨手笨脚的。为什么你就不能承认是你拖了我们后腿呢。

"I'm the one? You're the one that's going too fast, and don't forget, Asuka, that you've fallen and – as you would say: generally, be a klutz. Just as much as I have!"
是我吗？明明是你太快了，而且别忘了，明日香，你自己也摔倒过，用你的话说就是：同样笨手笨脚。跟我一样！

"Are you calling me a liar, Shinji!?" Asuka narrowed her eyes dangerously.
"你是在说我是骗子吗，真嗣！？" 明日香眯起眼睛，目光危险。

Shinji gulped under the intense glare, his cheekiness evaporated, "So-sorry!" he tried to avert the subject, "well, anyways, where do we go now?"
在强烈的目光下，真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫，他的俏皮劲儿顿时消失无踪，"对-对不起！" 他试图转移话题，"那，我们接下来去哪儿呢？"

"How would I know? You're more familiar with the city, after all." Asuka conceded, "however, make sure wherever you take me will be somewhere good. Or, I'll make you suffer, got it?"
我怎么知道？毕竟你对这座城市更熟悉。" 明日香让步道，"不过，你带我去的地方可得是好地方。不然，我会让你不好受，明白了吗？

"Hai, hai." 是，是。

"What's this?! PizzaHut?" Asuka stared at the logo, "you reckon to impress me with fast food?!"
这是什么？！必胜客？" 明日香盯着招牌，"你想用快餐来讨好我？！

"Hey! It's not like we are…that," Shinji protested, "what do you expect me to do? Take you to some high-end restaurant where all the couples go to?"
嘿！我们又不是那种关系……" 真嗣反驳道，"你指望我怎么做？带你去那些情侣才去的高档餐厅吗？

Asuka pondered for a moment, "well, I guess you're right," she sighed, "PizzaHut it is."
明日香沉思片刻，“嗯，我想你是对的，”她叹了口气，“那就必胜客吧。”

The Children walked into the restaurant and immediately started drawing a lot of attention. They thought it was the stupid outfit they were wearing that caused this. It was then Shinji and Asuka began to feel embarrassed. They hastily went to the far corner of the room and sat down. The waiter came, raising an eyebrow as he saw the Children but made no comments.
孩子们走进餐厅，立刻吸引了众多目光。他们以为是自己那身愚蠢的装扮惹人注目。这时，真嗣和明日香开始感到尴尬。他们急忙走到房间的远角坐下。服务员走过来，看到孩子们时扬了扬眉毛，但并未多言。

"Mein Gott. Misato really likes screwing with us! Why do we have to listen to that stupid song all day, and all night! I just don't get it." Asuka complained as she finished ordering and put down the menu. Shinji didn't pay her much mind, continuing to stare hard at the table. "Geez, it's so annoying. Don't you agree, Shinji?" She asked, turning towards the boy as he continued to stare. "Hey, Shinji?" "Hmmm?" Shinji replied, glancing over at the girl who had called his attention, wondering exactly what she could want. "I'm just wondering, what exactly is the problem between you and your father? What, do you have a father complex or something?"
“我的天啊。美里真是喜欢捉弄我们！为什么我们得整天整夜听那首蠢歌！我真是不明白。”明日香点完餐后放下菜单抱怨道。真嗣没太理会她，继续盯着桌子发呆。“真是烦死了。你不觉得吗，真嗣？”她转向男孩问道，而他依旧凝视着。“嘿，真嗣？”“嗯？”真嗣应了一声，瞥向叫他注意的女孩，好奇她到底想说什么。“我只是好奇，你和你父亲之间到底有什么问题？难道，你有什么恋父情结之类的？”

"Wh-what are you talking about?" Shinji stammered, "Asuka, you know the Commander here is not my father. At least not a biological one. And don't even get started on the metaphysical aspect!"
你...你在说什么啊？" 真嗣结巴着说，"明日香，你知道这里的指挥官不是我父亲，至少不是亲生的。更别提那些玄乎的东西了！

"Hm, but you seemed…intimidated by him," Asuka pushed on, "I mean, why would you afraid of him, if he's not your father?"
嗯，但你看起来...挺怕他的，" 明日香继续追问，"我是说，如果他不是你父亲，你为什么要怕他呢？

Shinji moved into a sitting position, facing Asuka directly. "Look… It's not a father complex, as you called it." Shinji replied, wrapping his arms around his chest. "Look, I'll be blunt. I hate my father." Shinji said, causing Asuka's eyes to widen. "I hate him so much that I sometimes wonder how he even is my father." He said, watching as Asuka's eyes seemed to fly to a distant memory. "But…" Shinji continued, catching Asuka by surprise, who thought he would finish. "Although I know the Commander here is not my father, I still hate him."
真嗣坐起身来，直面明日香。"听着...这并不是你所说的恋父情结。" 真嗣回答，双臂环抱胸前。"老实说吧，我恨我父亲。" 真嗣的话让明日香的眼睛瞪大了。"我恨他到有时候都在想，他怎么可能是我父亲。" 他说着，注意到明日香的目光似乎飘向了某个遥远的记忆。"但是..." 真嗣继续道，让本以为他会结束的明日香感到意外，"尽管我知道这里的指挥官不是我父亲，我仍然恨他。"

"Right…" Asuka replied, "Sorry, I didn't really think about it like that." 'Mein Gott,' she thought, 'he's just like me…'
"这样啊..." 明日香回应道，"抱歉，我之前没这么想过。" 她心想，'天哪，他跟我真像...'

"That's alright." Shinji replied, yawning from tiredness. "What about your father? Did you get along well with him?"
没关系。" 真嗣回答道，因疲惫而打了个哈欠。"你和你父亲呢？你们相处得好吗？

"You know, I almost didn't have a father," Asuka stated, staring off into space. Shinji just raised his eyebrows, wondering whether there would be more to the story. "He was never there when I needed him…" Asuka trailed off, memories of those years coming back quickly.
"你知道吗，我差点就没有父亲，" 明日香说道，目光飘向远方。真嗣只是挑了挑眉，好奇是否还有更多故事。"每当我需要他时，他总是不在……" 明日香的声音渐渐低沉，那些年的记忆迅速涌上心头。

"Asuka?" Shinji asked, watching the girl carefully, wondering exactly what she was currently thinking about. Asuka's eyes were far away, obviously sitting subtly in a memory from long ago. One she'd rather forget. "Look," Asuka finally replied, after having stayed silent for a couple minutes. "I'm like you, I don't like my father. He was a bit of an asshole. He left my mother all alone when she needed him most." She said, looking away from the boy. "I don't want to talk about it. It's a part of my life I've tried so hard to forget. So just leave it alone." She finished, intending to leave it there.
"明日香？" 真嗣轻声询问，仔细观察着女孩，想知道她此刻究竟在想些什么。明日香的目光遥远，显然沉浸在一段久远的记忆中，那是她宁愿忘却的往事。"听着，" 明日香终于开口，沉默了几分钟后说道，"我和你一样，不喜欢我的父亲。他有点混蛋。在我母亲最需要他的时候，他抛下了她。" 她转过头去，不再看向男孩。"我不想谈这个。这是我努力想要忘记的生活片段。所以，就让它过去吧。" 她结束道，打算就此打住。

Shinji stared at her in shock. He wasn't expecting the girl to not believe in her own father, like how he didn't truly believe in his own father. It was unusual to the boy, as he took out the SDAT and said, "Alright…reckon we can listen to the music to kill time, then?"
真嗣震惊地盯着她。他没想到这个女孩会不信任自己的父亲，就像他从未真正信任过自己的父亲一样。这对男孩来说很反常，他掏出 SDAT，说道：“好吧……看来我们可以听听音乐打发时间了，怎么样？”

Asuka turned to him and smiled a small smile, "Sure, why not."
明日香转头向他微微一笑，“当然，有何不可。”

The Children out on their respective headphones, and music started to flow out. The entire time, one thing played in Shinji's mind. 'We're not that different…'
两人各自戴上耳机，音乐开始流淌。整个过程中，真嗣脑海里一直回响着一个念头：‘我们其实没那么不同……’

Shinji and Asuka left the restaurant after finishing the meal, a heavy atmosphere hanging between them. The revelations put both Children into deep thoughts. Thoughts about their past lives, the new world, and themselves.
真嗣和明日香吃完饭后离开了餐厅，两人之间弥漫着沉重的气氛。那些揭露的真相让两个孩子陷入了深思。思考着他们的过去，这个新世界，以及他们自己。

Their train of thought was cut off by a familiar cry, "Oi! They MATCH!"
他们的思绪被一声熟悉的喊叫打断，“喂！他们穿情侣装！”

Shinji and Asuka turned their heads in the direction of the voice, just to find Kensuke, Hikari, and Toji standing 30 meters behind them. "And they denied their relationship! I knew it from the beginning!" Kensuke cried.
真嗣和明日香循声望去，只见 30 米开外，剑介、光和渡边正站在那里。“还否认关系呢！我一开始就知道了！”剑介喊道。

"What the hell are you talking about?!" Asuka yelled back, "there's nothing between us! Now get lost or I'll make you lost!"
“你们在胡说八道什么？！”明日香反驳道，“我们之间什么都没有！现在滚开，不然我让你们滚！”

"Shikinami-san! But your hair…" Hikari said in a disgusted tone, "OH MY GOD YOU GUYS ARE SO FILTHY!
“式波同学！可是你的头发…”光用厌恶的语气说，“天啊，你们俩真是脏死了！”

Asuka blinked, "what's wrong with my hair?" She looked around and found a large show window and looked at herself. "WHAT THE FUCK!" came from the aforementioned girl, quickly followed by a redheaded storm. "LISTEN! This is NOT what you think!"
明日香眨了眨眼，“我的头发怎么了？”她环顾四周，发现了一面巨大的展示窗，便朝自己望去。“搞什么鬼！”那女孩惊呼出声，紧接着是一阵红发风暴。“听着！事情不是你想的那样！”

"YOU ARE LIVING IN SIN!" Hikari cried, burying her face in her hands. Complete bafflement and abomination on Toji and Kensuke's faces. "Matching outfits! Not coming to school! Going out together! And your hair…" Toji said, "I believed in you, Shinji!"
“你这是在堕落！”光大声喊道，双手掩面。东治和健介脸上写满了困惑与厌恶。“穿情侣装！不来学校！一起外出！还有你的头发……”东治说，“我曾相信你，真嗣！”

Asuka turned to Shinji as well, blushing redder than her hair, "Third, for fuck's sake, why didn't you say anything?" The accused boy tilted his head as he turned away from his friends, confused about the situation, "say anything about what?"
明日香也转向真嗣，脸颊比她的发色还要红，“三号，该死的，你为什么不说点什么？”被指责的男孩侧过头，避开朋友的目光，对这局面感到困惑，“说什么呢？”

"This!" Asuka pointed to her rather chaotic hair, her voice incensed. "About my perfect Just-Had-Sex hairdo?" she spelled the letter in the English fashion. "And I was wondering why the hell all the people looked at us so strange!" She shook her head, her voice far from calming down. "Which brings us back to the question, why the fuck didn't you say anything?"
“这个！”明日香指着自己颇为凌乱的头发，语气中带着怒火。“关于我这副刚滚完床单的发型？”她用英文的方式拼出了那个词。“我还纳闷为什么所有人都用那种奇怪的眼神看我们！”她摇摇头，声音丝毫没有平息的迹象。“这就回到了最初的问题，你他妈为什么不说点什么？”

"Wh-what? I, I thought you left it like that for a reason!" Shinji hastily said, "I'm sorry!"
什、什么？我，我还以为你那样做是有原因的！" 真嗣急忙说道，"对不起！

Asuka sighed, she knew the boy was very oblivious to this kind of stuff. "Argh! Let's just go back! I don't want to stay outside with my hair like this for a second longer!" She grabbed Shinji's wrist forcefully and dragged him to the nearest Geofront entrance, leaving the trio standing there, still hard to believe what they had just witnessed.
明日香叹了口气，她知道这个男孩对这类事情非常迟钝。"啊！我们快回去吧！我不想再顶着这样的发型在外面多待一秒了！" 她用力抓住真嗣的手腕，拖着他朝最近的地下都市入口走去，留下那三人站在原地，仍然难以相信他们刚刚目睹的一切。

Asuka angrily threw her headphone on the ground. They messed up again – the synchronization score was only 14 percent. Unacceptable. Misato even brought Rei Ikari here to witness her failure. Humiliation. "That's it! I can't sink to the level of this…animated turnip!" She spat. Shinji laid face down on the ground, groaning in pain.
明日香气愤地将耳机摔在地上。他们又搞砸了——同步率只有 14%。简直无法接受。美里甚至把绫波丽带来见证她的失败。真是羞辱。"够了！我不能沦落到和这个……会动的萝卜一个水平！" 她啐了一口。真嗣脸朝下趴在地上，痛苦地呻吟着。

Misato smirked, "so, you've given up?"
美里嘴角勾起一抹笑意，"怎么，你放弃了吗？"

"Hmph, but you have no one else, do you?" Asuka smirked as well, looking to the side. The great Asuka Langley Soryu never gave up.
"哼，但你也没有别人了，不是吗？" 明日香也得意地笑了笑，目光转向一旁。伟大的明日香·兰格雷·索西尔从不放弃。

Misato closed her eyes, "Rei, why don't you give it a try?"
美里闭上眼睛，"绫波，你何不试试看？"

Rei raised an eyebrow, "Katsuragi-san, really? I don't think I should…"
绫波挑了挑眉，"葛城小姐，真的吗？我觉得我不应该……"

"Just do it, we aren't expecting much more," Misato interrupted.
"试试看吧，我们也没期待更多，" 美里打断道。

"Alright." Rei casually walked over and out on the headphones. Asuka's smirk became a raised eyebrow, then a frown, and finally a mix of anger and embarrassment as Rei and Shinji danced in sync. Although not really meeting the criteria, it was still much better than the former parings.
"好吧。" 绫波随意地走过去戴上耳机。明日香的坏笑变成了挑眉，接着是皱眉，最后是混合着愤怒和尴尬的表情，因为绫波和真嗣同步地跳起了舞。虽然并不完全符合标准，但这比之前的组合要好得多。

"Well, maybe I think I'll let Shinji and Rei do the test, then."
嗯，或许我该让真嗣和绫波来执行测试。

"But…but she couldn't even get to phase two connection!" cried Asuka, pointing her finger at Rei, "only Shinji and I can do it!"
可是…可是她连第二阶段连接都做不到！" 明日香指着绫波喊道，"只有我和真嗣能做到！

"Maybe, maybe not, but from what Dr. Akagi told me, only one person who can reach phase two is needed. The other person is only there to share the mental load. Rei might just be able to do this."
或许吧，或许不，但根据赤木博士告诉我的，只需要一个人能达到第二阶段。另一个人只是为了分担精神负担。绫波可能正好能做到这一点。

明日香想说些什么。她想请求再给她一次机会，但那听起来太可悲了。她想说以前也成功过，但房间里的每个人都见证了这一点。她想说她的耳机坏了，但她嘴里发出的只是一连串的喘息声和语无伦次的抱怨声。

"就是这样！我再也受不了了！" 她终于想出了一些言之凿凿的话，然后冲出了房间。明日香想把门关上，但由于门是电子的，她差点摔倒在地。只有她敏捷的反应才让她不至于在其他人看来真的很可怜。

房间里的人面面相觑--美里露出了好笑的表情，而嘉治则继续目不转睛地盯着她看；玲则完全不为所动。另一方面，真嗣却有点担心。他想起了预言家对他说的话；他醒来走到门口，对大人们说："嗯......我去看看她。" 他也匆匆离开了。美里狡黠的笑容越来越灿烂。

明日香站在地锋湖边，脸上没有任何表情。她凝视着湖中自己的倒影，幼小的心灵中思绪万千。很快，她的身边出现了另一个倒影。"嗯......" 

"不，什么都别说，我已经知道了，"当她恍然大悟真嗣追来的事实时，她心中有什么东西在蠢蠢欲动，"我在这里的唯一目的就是做测试，就像我当时的唯一目的......就是驾驶 EVA 一样。我别无选择。" 

明日香转向真嗣，"我们是同病相怜，不是吗？" 她的表情表现出了一种真嗣从未见过的坚定--也许他见过，但他忘了--"无论如何，我都要让美里和怜蒙羞！" 

"你不必出现在他们面前。"真嗣说。

"你想得太简单了，你是个男人，不是吗？" 她的声音算不上恼怒，但绝对是严厉的。"这已经不是完成测试的问题了。而是要克服困难，完成开始的事情，向世界展示我能做到而他们做不到的事情！这关乎荣誉、骄傲，最重要的是关乎我的尊严！我会十倍奉还！" 

真嗣惊讶不已。他很惊讶，她的意志力竟然还没有把眼前的湖水蒸发掉。明日香昂首挺胸，仰望着地球前线的人工穹顶。真嗣瞥见了她明亮的蓝眼睛--如果不是理智告诉他，他会说她的眼睛在发光。真嗣没有说话，因为他的脸上露出了最深情的微笑。现在他终于明白自己为什么会爱上这个讨厌又自大的红发女孩了。

明日香扭头看向真嗣，看到了他的笑容。虽然他马上收回了笑容，但她还是瞥见了。她从未见过这样的笑容。她也知道他的笑容意味着什么。一股暖流涌上了她的胸口，她及时转过身，掩去了自己的笑容和淡淡的红晕。

XXXXXX

"EVA是什么？" 赤木直子博士摘下用来偷听孩子们说话的耳机，喃喃自语道："两人比我想象的要有趣得多......" 

XXXXXX

在真嗣和明日香看来，这个夜晚漫长而重复，但他们的一天终于结束了。美里和加治一直都待在房间里，目前他们对这个安排的希望已经降到了最低点。虽然他们还是犯了很多错误，但明日香配合多了，真嗣也更加努力了。

"好了，今晚就到此为止吧！" 当天晚上，美里喊道，她的手指按摩着太阳穴，因为她又想起了白天乏善可陈的表现。真嗣和明日香停下脚步，瞥了一眼淡紫色头发的女人，她继续沮丧地揉着太阳穴。"好吧，我现在就告诉你们，你们俩还有很长的路要走！" 美里一开始就非常非常明确地表达了她对这件事的看法。"直截了当地说，这是不可接受的。" 她的话让加治微微翻了个白眼。

"冷静点，葛城。"卡基回答道，他动手搂住了紫发女子，后者立刻将他的手从腰间拍开。"别以为你可以随便抓我，卡基！" 她说着，双手再次交叉。

"我只是想说，"卡基回答，举起双手防卫。"你不应该对他们这么苛刻，他们才刚刚开始训练。距离下一次测试还有四天时间。而且很明显，他们正在变得更好。" 

"我明白。" 美里回答道，脸上依然带着不屑。"但我期待的进步远不止这些。" 

"别那么担心。" 卡基回答，脸上挂着微笑。"他们会成功的，我相信他们。你也应该相信他们，葛城。" 说着，他给了她一个招牌式的淑女杀手微笑。美里没有上当，只是瞪了他一眼。"哦，好吧，我想我该告辞了。" 说着，他向两个孩子挥了挥手，然后迅速离开了。

当门在那人身后关上时，美里叹了口气，迅速回到了她面前的孩子们身边。"现在，我要你们俩一直听着这首曲子。这纯粹是为了让你们俩都能感受到音乐的魅力，这样我们就能争取在几天内完成这套动作。你们俩都明白吗？" 她挑眉问道。

"我明白了，但我们为什么不用特殊芯片跳舞呢？" 明日香问，"我是说，那样会容易得多，你不觉得吗？" 

"是的，但问题是在测试期间，不会有这样的设备，所以芯片只是为了让你了解经过这么多训练后，你应该变成什么样！" 美里解释道，"你可以尽情地使用它，但要记住，跳舞的时候可不能用它！" 

"是，美里。" 两个孩子一脸无聊地回答道。

"别这么无聊嘛，你们两个。" 美里笑着对两个孩子说。"起床时间是早上 6 点。晚安！" 美里说完，很快就离开了房间，一边挥手一边向自己的房间走去。

明日香叹了口气，迅速离开自己准备当晚睡觉，而真嗣则立即前往浴室洗澡。他很快就出来上床睡觉了。明日香去洗澡了，真嗣躺在被褥上，仰望着天花板。"嗯......其实已经不陌生了......" 他自言自语道。淋浴的声音淅淅沥沥地传遍了整个小房间，一整天的疲惫终于涌上心头，真嗣渐渐进入了梦乡。

"你好，池城真嗣，"隐身的预言家终于出现了，"最近怎么样？" 

"糟透了，"真嗣叹了口气回答，"好吧，至少她现在和我说话了。我想这也算是一种进步吧。" 

"很高兴听到这个消息。你......哦，该死，她怎么......我得走了，明天见。" 预言者瞬间消失了，留下呆若木鸡的真嗣一个人在虚空中。

几分钟前 

明日香从浴室出来，失望地发现真嗣已经酣然入睡。她环顾四周，想找点事情做，最好是能恶作剧一下这个熟睡的男孩。当她看到慎二床头柜上的 SDTA 播放器时，她露出了恶魔般的笑容。把信治的耳机戴在他头上后，她戴上了自己的耳机。她非常好奇，当一个睡着的人和一个醒着的人相连时，会发生什么。她打算一探究竟，这也是真嗣的一个恶作剧。

明日香打开了 SDAT。

一开始，似乎什么也没有发生。然而仅仅几秒钟后，明日香就被一股无法抗拒的睡意袭来。"不是......好......ID......" 砰的一声，她瘫坐在真嗣床边的地板上。

明日香睁开眼睛，发现自己正站在公寓的阳台上，眼前站着一个熟悉的人影。"真嗣？" 她叫了一声。

真嗣转过身来，当他看到红发女孩时，困惑地眨了眨眼睛："明日香？你在这里做什么？" 他的语气带着一丝恐惧。

"我怎么知道？我只知道我可能在做梦，"明日香说，"这是我的公寓，应该是我来问这个问题，你说呢？" 

"什么？我也住在这里，"真嗣反驳道，"你不能就这样...... "他被另一个熟悉的声音打断了。

"......你就是这样得到同步分数的。记住，你们两个都要拿到 100 分，才有机会打败天使。现在我们来试试这个。明日香，去左边的垫子 真嗣，你去右边 好的，你们两个都戴上耳机 好的 准备好了吗？三 二 一 

是美里的声音 说的是天使 

真嗣和明日香冲进了公寓。事实上，他们更像是飘进了公寓。眼前的景象让他们目瞪口呆，说不出话来。

随着熟悉的节奏响起，另一对 "慎二 "和 "明日香 "穿着和 "漂浮 "的那对差不多的舞衣，开始在他们再熟悉不过的 DDR 机器上跳舞。他们的动作和谐而同步。漂浮在空中的慎二和明日香惊讶地看着另一对完成了动作。

最后一拍过后，记分牌上显示出 95% 的同步分数。

美里不知道该说些什么。她以前从未见过有人的动作如此完美地同步。他们的动作无可挑剔、步调一致。这几乎就像是......他们是被训练成这样的。不，他们生来就是这样的。

飞行员 "们面面相觑，也是一脸的难以置信。沉默持续了大约十秒钟，美里终于开口了："嗯，那......相当令人印象深刻。继续努力吧。考虑到这是你们第一次这么做，我想你们不需要费多大力气就能完成我们的目标。" 

漂浮在空中的明日香和真嗣也不知道该说些什么。

'明日香'整理了一下自己的情绪："好吧，你能指望伟大的明日香-兰利-索留什么呢？我敢打赌，如果不是八嘎慎二在那里表演了几个错误的步骤，我们早就可以做到百分之百了！" 

'真嗣'笑着说："嗯，明日香，我......嗯，也许你应该慢一点？这样我就更容易追上了。" 

明日香咧开嘴笑了，感觉自我感觉良好。"当然，三娃。只要别犯任何愚蠢的错误就行！" 

很快，"飞行员 "们又开始了新一轮的比赛。这一次，他们的动作无可挑剔，如果可能的话。两个头脑，一颗心。

突然，整个场景消失了，真嗣和明日香再次发现自己漂浮在虚空中。明日香首先开口："那到底是什么？" 

"我......看样子......我们在跳舞，就像我们在这里做的一样？" 真嗣说道。

"嗯，但是美里说我们这样做是为了对抗天使！" 明日香兴奋地说，她知道自己有更多机会与天使战斗，"我们完全做到了！" 

"等等......那么，会不会是......我们的记忆？" 

"我想是的......我是说，没有别的解释了。" 明日香沉思了一会儿，"真巧啊......我们最后也做了同样的事情。" 

"可他们做得那么好！为什么我们不行？" 真嗣疑惑地说。

"我......根本猜不到。"明日香承认道，"好吧，看看好的一面。现在我想起来我是怎么做到的了，醒来之后，我一定能做得更好！" 

"那我呢？" 

"哼，老三，这是我的梦，你根本就不真实，我为什么要关心你？" 虽然她嘴上这么说，但心里却在怀疑这是不是真的。

"你的梦？我还以为这是我的梦呢！" 真嗣反驳道。

"你在说什么？哦，该死！"明日香想起了自己入睡前的最后一个动作，"好吧，现在我想我知道这是怎么一回事了......" 

"什么？你是在暗示你以某种方式侵入了我的梦境？" 真嗣的眼睛睁得大大的，"你......怎么可能做到这一点？" 

"就当这是你的运气吧，老三，不是我想看你的梦。"明日香哼了一声，"谁知道你肮脏的脑子里会做什么梦呢？" 

真嗣脸红了，如果在梦里也有可能的话，"什--什么？我--我不做梦......" 

明日香叹了口气："不管怎样，现在我得离开这里了。我们明天再谈这件事，好吗？" 见真嗣点头，明日香瞥了一眼四周，"嗯......不过，我怎么才能离开这里呢？" 

"嗯......我也不知道？" 

"戈特，你这里有什么好帮手吗？"明日香嘲笑道，"让我试试自残吧。" 她用力咬了一下自己的胳膊，但并不疼。"哎哟！" 真嗣哭着说："我的胳膊，好疼！明日香，住手！" 

明日香立刻停了下来。就在真嗣松了一口气的时候，她的脸上露出了恶魔般的笑容。"这不是很方便吗......" 她捶了捶自己的肚子。

"哎哟！明日香，你这是干什么？" 真嗣痛苦地呻吟着，"为什么受伤的是我！" 

"可能是芯片的副作用吧，"明日香笑道，"我可要好好享受一下......" 

"好吧，这是你自找的！" 真嗣也捶了一下自己的肚子。

"哎哟！" 明日香大叫起来："真嗣你这个混蛋！你怎么能打女孩子！" 

"我只是好奇！我不知道会伤到你。"真嗣压抑着狡猾的笑容。

明日香死死地盯着他，让真嗣脊背发凉。这时他才知道自己可能踩到了底线。

明日香低头看了看自己的下腹部和下面。真嗣惊恐地喘着气，因为他意识到她要做什么。糟糕...... 

强有力的一击。一个男孩痛苦地跪在地上，如果这在虚空中可能的话。

AN：节奏缓慢，在接下来的训练中会有更多的WAFF和Angst。请留下评论！

### Chapter 6: Momentarily United Minds pt3
短暂的心灵相通 第三部分

Beep Beep Beep CRASH 哔哔哔哔 砰

Misato Katsuragi rubbed her eyes, yawning and getting up from her bed. She was never an early person, but the recent circumstance left her no choice. Yesterday the Children made as little progress on the dance routine as Misato's progress on being sober. Well, consider it's something since she hadn't been drinking for the past few days.
葛城美里揉了揉眼睛，打着哈欠从床上坐起来。她向来不是早起的人，但近来的情况让她别无选择。昨天，孩子们在舞蹈练习上的进展微乎其微，正如美里在戒酒上的进展一样。不过，考虑到她已经好几天没喝酒了，这也算是一种进步。

Without the help of alcohol, last night's sleep came rather difficultly, leaving a tired and dizzy Misato in the morning. She washed herself and grabbed some bread for breakfast, and headed to Children's room, which was just two doors beside her temporary accommodation. 'The kids aren't up yet?' She wondered, seeing the door still closed off. Misato knocked on the door – although she didn't need to – and waited for a reply. As much as she just wanted to use her keycard, she still gave the kids some privacy.
没有酒精的帮助，昨晚的睡眠颇为艰难，早晨的美里感到疲惫而眩晕。她洗漱完毕，抓了些面包当早餐，便前往孩子们的房间，那儿离她暂住的房间仅隔两扇门。“孩子们还没起床吗？”她疑惑地看着紧闭的房门。美里敲了敲门——尽管她本可以直接用门卡——然后等待回应。尽管她很想直接用门卡进去，但还是给了孩子们一些私人空间。

However her patience quickly evaporated under the pressure of time. She called out, "I'm coming in!" And took out her keycard, swiping it through the slot on the electronic lock.
然而，她的耐心在时间的压力下迅速消散。她喊道：“我要进来了！”随即掏出钥匙卡，在电子锁的槽口刷了一下。

The door hissed open, and Misato was greeted by a ludicrous scene she never thought she would see from those two kids. Shinji – in his bed - was curled into a fetal pose, a painful expression on his pale face. Asuka, on the other hand, was lying on the floor, looking perturbed. They both had their headphones on, sounding asleep.
门嘶嘶作响地打开，美里眼前出现了一幕荒诞不经的景象，她从未想过会在这两个孩子身上看到。真嗣——躺在床上——蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，苍白的脸上带着痛苦的表情。而明日香则躺在地板上，显得心烦意乱。两人都戴着耳机，看似睡着了。

Misato cleared her throat, "Ahem! GET UP NOW!" She shouted, trying to wake up the children.
美里清了清嗓子，“咳！现在就起床！”她大声喊道，试图唤醒孩子们。

Nothing happened. 毫无反应。

"You guys asked for this," Misato walked over and looked down at Asuka with an expression mixed with anger and amusement. She pondered for a moment, then reached down to the redhead and poked the side of her waist.
"是你们自找的，" 惣流走过来，低头看着明日香，脸上混合着愤怒与好笑的表情。她沉思片刻，随即弯腰戳了戳红发少女的腰侧。

Asuka stirred but not wakening. Misato grumbled in annoyance, attacking more aggressively. Asuka would stir with each of her jabs but made absolutely no sound or sign of waking up. She then turned her target to Shinji.
明日香动了动，却并未醒来。惣流不耐烦地嘟囔着，愈发猛烈地发起攻势。每次戳刺，明日香都会有所反应，但就是不出声，也没有丝毫醒来的迹象。接着，她将目标转向了真嗣。

After a round of attacks, nothing different happened as well.
一轮攻击过后，情况依旧没有任何变化。

Now Misato started getting worried. Normally the kids, at least Asuka, would wake up earlier than Misato. Although today it was 6 a.m., much earlier than Asuka's normal time to wake up, her attacks were more than capable of doing the job, and they weren't that late to bed last night, either.
这时，惣流开始感到担忧。通常情况下，孩子们，至少明日香，会比惣流更早醒来。尽管今天才六点，远早于明日香平时的起床时间，但她的攻击力度足以唤醒他们，况且昨晚他们睡得也不算太晚。

Unless they did something last night and stayed up late.
除非他们昨晚做了什么，熬了夜。

Misato quickly shook the thought off. Judging from their clothing, at least they didn't do anything…that might become a surprise ten months later. And they wouldn't dare to, since Misato had told them about the security camera-
明日香很快将这个念头甩开。从他们的衣着来看，至少他们没做什么……可能会在十个月后带来惊喜的事。而且他们也不敢，因为明日香已经告诉过他们关于监控摄像头的事——

Right. The footage. 对了，录像。

Misato facepalmed as she realized her stupidity. She went back to her room and extracted the footage, looking for what happened after she had gone. At first everything seemed normal – Shinji went to shower then to bed, Asuka went to shower, too – Misato raised an eyebrow as Asuka came out of the bathroom, and looked at sleeping Shinji intently.
明日香意识到自己的愚蠢，不禁捂脸。她回到房间，调出录像，查看自己离开后发生了什么。起初一切看似正常——真嗣去洗澡然后睡觉，明日香也去洗澡了——当明日香从浴室出来，专注地看着熟睡的真嗣时，明日香挑了挑眉。

Asuka walked to his bed, looking at his sleeping face, and leaned down… Misato's heart rate quickened-
明日香走向他的床边，凝视着他熟睡的面庞，俯身下去……美里心跳加速——

Asuka put the headphones on his head and put on her own moments later. Misato let out a breath she didn't know she was holding.
明日香将耳机戴在他头上，片刻后自己也戴上。美里这才意识到自己一直屏住了呼吸。

Then Asuka fell to the floor.
接着，明日香倒在了地上。

Misato blinked. 'Strange…Asuka put on her headphones and seconds later she simply fell to the floor.' She connected the dots and made an educated guess about what had caused the Children acted as they were. She hastily left her room and entered Shinji and Asuka's; without hesitation she pulled Asuka's headphones off.
美里眨了眨眼。'奇怪……明日香戴上耳机，几秒钟后就突然倒地。'她将线索串联起来，对孩子们异常行为的原因做出了有根据的猜测。她急忙离开自己的房间，进入真嗣和明日香的房间；毫不犹豫地摘下了明日香的耳机。

"HELP ME! LET ME OUT!" Asuka practically jumped from the ground, her eyes shot open, unfocused. Upon setting her gaze on the taken aback Misato, Asuka shook her head violently, trying to make sure she wasn't still in the dream world. At that moment, Shinji woke up as well, "Ahhhhh!" He yelled, hastily looked around him, before finally focused his eyes on Asuka and Misato.
"救命啊！放我出去！" 明日香几乎是从地上跳起来的，她的眼睛猛地睁开，目光涣散。当她看到一脸惊愕的葛城美里时，明日香猛烈地摇头，试图确认自己是否还在梦境中。与此同时，真嗣也醒了过来，"啊——！" 他大叫一声，急忙环顾四周，最终将目光聚焦在明日香和葛城美里身上。

The Children calmed down, leaving a dumbfounded Misato standing in the room. "Wh-what happened?" She asked after a minute of silence, while the trio simply stared at each other.
孩子们渐渐平静下来，留下一脸茫然的葛城美里站在房间里。"这...这是怎么了？" 她在一分钟的沉默后问道，而三人只是相互对视。

Asuka composed herself first, "shit…Misato, that chip has some serious side-effects!"
明日香首先镇定下来，"该死...葛城，那芯片的副作用太严重了！"

Misato nodded, "I figured as much."
葛城美里点头，"我早就料到了。"

"So you took off my headphones?" Asuka asked; seeing Misato nodded again, she continued, "thanks, I guess. I mean, we couldn't wake up no matter what I did when…dreaming."
所以你摘掉了我的耳机？"明日香问道；看到美里再次点头，她继续说，"谢了，我想。我的意思是，无论我怎么尝试，当我们……做梦时，就是醒不来。

"This sounds…dangerous," Misato sighed, "good news is you aren't allowed to use it in the test. That means you aren't required to wear the headphones – you can always use the speakers for the music – when dancing."
这听起来……很危险，"美里叹了口气，"好消息是，测试中不允许使用它。这意味着你不必佩戴耳机——你可以用扬声器播放音乐——跳舞时。

"Right," Shinji said, still clearing his mind. Asuka had given him hell in the dream world, but she got bored eventually, and began trying everything she could do to wake up. Nothing worked, apparently. Shinji walked to the bathroom, "I'll go wash-"
对，"真嗣说，仍在整理思绪。明日香在梦境世界里让他吃了不少苦头，但最终她厌倦了，开始尝试各种方法醒来。显然，什么都没奏效。真嗣走向浴室，"我去洗个脸——

"Ladies first!" Asuka cut him off, "and we have a lot to talk about later, Baka!" She entered the bathroom and began her morning routine. Misato gave Shinji a sympathetic look, who sighed in response.
"女士优先！"明日香打断他，"而且我们待会儿还有很多要谈的，笨蛋！"她走进浴室，开始她的晨间例行程序。美里向真嗣投去同情的目光，后者叹了口气作为回应。

XXXXXX

Both children were in a strange mood the whole morning. Not irritated, not anxious, and certainly not happy, either. They just both seemed to have a lot on their minds. Feeling the uncomfortable pressure of the heavy atmosphere, Misato asked during breakfast, "what's up with you two?" She said, gulping down a can of beer.
整个上午，两个孩子都显得心事重重。既不烦躁，也不焦虑，当然也谈不上高兴。他们似乎都满腹心事。感受到这沉闷气氛带来的不适，美里在早餐时问道：“你们俩怎么了？”她一边说着，一边灌下一罐啤酒。

"Nothing," they both answered in unison.
“没什么。”他们异口同声地回答。

"Hmm," Misato wasn't going to buy it; however, she decided it was not important for now. "Well, I'll leave you two here to practice. I need to go out the Geofront for a while, I'll come back before lunch and check your progress." She left the room in a swift movement.
“哼，”美里并不买账，但她觉得眼下这并不重要。“好吧，你们俩留在这里练习。我得去一趟 Geofront，午饭前回来检查你们的进展。”她迅速离开了房间。

The Children finished the breakfast in silence. "So, Baka Shinji," Asuka started after they washed the plastic plates specifically designed to withstand impact, "it was the real you in there, right?" She shot him an unreadable gaze.
孩子们默默地吃完早餐。“那么，笨蛋真嗣，”洗完专为抗冲击设计的塑料盘子后，明日香开口道，“刚才在里面的是真正的你，对吧？”她投去一个难以捉摸的眼神。

"Um, yeah," Shinji replied, "I guess it's the chip doing the job?"
呃，对，" 真嗣回答道，"我想是芯片在起作用吧？

"No shit Sherlock!" Asuka snapped, "anyways, what do you remember?"
废话少说，福尔摩斯！" 明日香厉声道，"不管怎样，你记得什么？

"Well, we were…dancing to synchronize to fight an Angel?" Shinji recalled the dream, "the dance was almost the same as what we're doing now…as well as the music."
嗯，我们当时……为了同步战斗而跳舞？" 真嗣回忆着梦境，"那舞蹈几乎和我们现在做的一样……还有那音乐。

"Hm," Asuka put the finger on her chin, "then do you remember…how did we do it? I mean, the steps? The dance? How did we synchronize so well? Because I do."
嗯，" 明日香用手指抵着下巴，"那你记得……我们是怎么做的吗？我是说，舞步？舞蹈？我们是怎么同步得这么好的？因为我记得。

"I'm not sure," Shinji replied, "how about we try it out?"
我不太确定，" 真嗣回答道，"要不我们试试看？

The Children proceeded to the mat, trying to recall how they did it back then. It was practically in their memory at that moment.
孩子们走向垫子，试图回忆起当时他们是怎么做的。那一刻，这几乎成了他们的记忆。

The music flew through the room, and our favorite pair started dancing. To both of their surprise they improved a lot – well, not a surprise since they knew they were going to do well. They moved in harmony, not perfect, but definitely a huge improvement – and not the kind of improvement that could be made just overnight.
音乐在房间里飘扬，我们最喜欢的这对搭档开始跳舞。令他们俩都感到惊讶的是，他们进步很快——嗯，并不意外，因为他们知道自己会表现出色。他们动作协调，虽不完美，但绝对是巨大的进步。这种进步都是需要时间积累的，绝非一蹴而就。

With the final beat sounded, Shinji and Asuka finished their last pose and looked at the scoreboard. It said 87 percent. Even better than Rei was able to accomplish.
随着最后一拍响起，真嗣和明日香完成了他们的最后一个姿势，并看向记分牌。上面显示着 87%。甚至比绫波丽所能达到的还要好。

Asuka smiled a proud smile, patting Shinji's shoulder, "Ha! I knew I can do this! It was you dragging me down, after all." She boasted, her mood improved a lot.
明日香得意地笑了笑，拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，“哈！我就知道我能行！说到底还是你拖后腿了。”她自夸道，心情大为好转。

Shinji sighed internally at her cockiness, "well, at this rate we'll be able to do this the end of the day I suppose." He left the dancing mat and grabbed a bottle of water, "you want one?" He asked, handing it out while picking up another bottle.
真嗣内心对她的自大叹了口气，“照这样下去，我想我们今天之内应该能搞定。”他离开跳舞毯，拿起一瓶水，“你要吗？”他问道，一边递出水，一边又拿起另一瓶。

"Sure," Asuka said, accepting the offer, and mumbled an almost inaudible 'thanks.'
“当然，”明日香接过水，低声咕哝了一句几乎听不见的“谢谢”。

Shinji shook his head, thinking he must've imagined hearing something. "What…do we do now? More practice?"
真嗣摇了摇头，心想自己一定是听错了。“那…我们现在做什么？继续练习吗？”

"Actually," Asuka said with an evil grin, a perfect revenge plan forming in her mind, "I've got something better! How do you feel about annoying Misato as much as possible so that we can maybe cause her to get as annoyed with us as possible!"
其实，" 明日香坏笑着说，心中已酝酿出一个完美的复仇计划，"我有更好的主意！你觉得不停地烦扰美里，让她也尝尝被我们烦到极点的滋味如何？

"Why do you want to do this?" Shinji asked, wondering exactly what Asuka's motives behind this were.
"你为什么要这么做？" 真嗣问道，好奇明日香此举背后的真正动机。

"It's obvious, isn't it?" Asuka replied, flicking his forehead. "Misato made a fool out of me yesterday and I want to get back at her after my moment yesterday. Now, we just have to keep fighting with each other, like we usually do, and hopefully it'll drive Misato so mad to she'll go crazy with what's happening!"
这不明摆着吗？" 明日香回答道，顺手弹了一下他的额头，"昨天美里让我出尽了洋相，我得找机会报复回来。现在，我们只需像往常一样互相斗嘴，希望这样能把美里逼得抓狂，让她也体会一下这种滋味！

"Shouldn't we, you know. Try and actually finish this training thing?" Shinji asked, staring at the girl. Asuka grinned, "Ah, now you see Shinji, that is the best part!" Asuka replied, waving her finger at him in glee. "While we're annoying Misato as much as we can, when she's finally gone mad and we'll surprise her with our perfect synchronization! We've already got to high 80s! We're just going to give Misato a little bit of payback!" Asuka's devilish grin grew wider, sitting on Shinji bed, stretching her perfect slim legs to relax the muscles.
"我们是不是应该，你知道的，试着完成这个训练呢？" 真嗣问道，目光紧盯着女孩。明日香咧嘴一笑，"啊，现在你明白了，真嗣，这就是最精彩的部分！" 明日香回答道，兴奋地向他摇着手指。"在我们尽可能地惹恼美里的时候，等她终于抓狂了，我们再以完美的同步率给她一个惊喜！我们已经达到 80%多了！这只是给美里一点小小的回报！" 明日香狡黠的笑容愈发扩大，她坐在真嗣的床上，伸展着她那修长纤细的双腿，放松肌肉。

"Well, sounds…fun," Shinji replied, trying as hard as he could to not think about Asuka's legs again, which he would inevitably spend most of the day trying not to think about. "Wait, there's a camera here!"
嗯，听起来……挺有趣的，" 真嗣回答，尽力不去想明日香的腿，尽管他知道这一天大部分时间他都会努力不去想这件事。"等等，这里有摄像头！

"Anta Baka?" Asuka huffed, "Misato said she'll go out of the Geofront! You really thought I wouldn't have thought about that?"
你傻吗？" 明日香哼了一声，"美里说她要离开第三新东京市！你真以为我不会考虑到这一点？

"Sorry…" Autopilot online.
"对不起……" 自动驾驶上线。

"You apologize too much!" Asuka said in annoyance, "you know, if you stop apologizing so much you probably won't look like such a wimp anymore."
你道歉太多了！"明日香不耐烦地说，"你知道吗，如果你少道点歉，可能看起来就不会那么窝囊了。

Shinji frowned a little but gave no verbal reply. Asuka just sighed before she set to planning.
真嗣微微皱眉，但没有出声回应。明日香叹了口气，随即开始策划起来。

XXXXXX

They were going to annoy Misato as much as they could. Asuka grinned as the said woman came into the room.
他们打算尽可能地惹恼美里。当那位女士走进房间时，明日香露出了狡黠的笑容。

"Hello, Misato!" Asuka called out, as chipper as she could.
"你好，美里！"明日香尽可能欢快地喊道。

"Geez, Asuka, could you quiet down a bit." Misato groggily replied, "The world's spinning and I need a beer."
哎呀，明日香，你能小点声吗？" 美里迷迷糊糊地回应，"世界都在转，我得来瓶啤酒。

"Of course, Misato!" Asuka replied, heading quickly for the refrigerator in Misato's room and taking out a beer, handing it to the woman.
"当然可以，美里！" 明日香应声道，迅速走向美里房间的冰箱，取出一瓶啤酒递给美里。

"You're too chipper…" Misato commented, but took the beer anyone, cracked it open with practiced precision and downed it in one go, an eye on Asuka the entire time. "What are you planning?"
你太兴奋了…" 美里评论道，但还是接过啤酒，熟练地打开瓶盖，一饮而尽，同时一直盯着明日香。"你在打什么主意？

"Nothing!" Asuka replied, sitting at the table in front of her. "What could possibly make you think that?"
哪有的事！" 明日香回答，坐在她面前的桌子旁。"你怎么会这么想呢？

"You're too chipper." Misato bluntly pointed out, raising an eyebrow at the girl.
"你太兴高采烈了。" 葛城直截了当地指出，朝女孩挑了挑眉。

"I'm not allowed to be chipper?" Asuka asked, crossing her arms back.
"我就不能兴高采烈吗？" 明日香反问，双臂交叉回抱。

"I didn't say that… Just quiet down a bit." Misato commented, throwing the can towards the garbage bag in the corner of the room. "Where's Shinji?"
我没那么说……只是稍微安静点。" 葛城评论道，将罐子扔向房间角落的垃圾袋。"真嗣呢？

"In the bathroom, he'll be out soon," Asuka replied.
"在洗手间，他马上就出来了，" 明日香回答。

Misato grinned at the girl, teasing mode activated. "Thinking on being in there with him?" She asked with mirth in her eyes.
美里对着女孩咧嘴一笑，开启了调侃模式。“在想和他一起进去的事吗？”她眼中闪烁着戏谑的光芒问道。

"Ew! Misato! What the hell are you thinking!?" Asuka replied, making a face at the table. "So, you are thinking it!"
“噫！美里！你脑子里都在想些什么啊！？”明日香回答道，对着桌子做了个鬼脸。“哦，原来你真这么想！”

"Stop! I don't want your stupid feelings on life to be projected onto me, I don't like Shinji that way! I want a real man!" Asuka squealed again, clasping her hands together as she usually did when talking about this kind of stuff.
“停！我不想让你那些愚蠢的生活情感强加给我，我对真嗣没那种感觉！我要的是真正的男人！”明日香再次尖叫起来，像往常谈论这类事情时一样，双手紧握。

"Exactly what someone who's falling for him would say!" Misato replied, still grinning as Asuka continued to glare at her in annoyance.
“这正是坠入情网的人才会说的话！”美里回应道，依旧咧嘴笑着，而明日香则继续恼怒地瞪着她。

"Like you should talk!" Asuka replied. "You wish you could jump Kaji at any point! I see the way he looks at you!"
说得好像你不是一样！"明日香回敬道，"你巴不得随时扑向加持先生！我可看得出他看你的眼神！

Misato stared at Asuka hard, her smile turning quickly to a frown. "I don't like that jerk!" Misato grumbled, slumping back in her seat and staring at the ceiling. "When Shinji gets out of the shower you two need to get to work." Misato said, slipping into business mode like a click of the fingers.
美里狠狠地盯着明日香，笑容迅速转为皱眉。"我可不喜欢那个混蛋！"美里嘟囔着，颓然靠回椅背，目光投向天花板。"等真嗣洗完澡，你们俩就得开始干活了。"美里说着，瞬间切换到工作模式，仿佛只需弹指之间。

"Yes, of course Misato." Asuka replied, grinning to herself. 'Phase one is a go!' Asuka thought to herself as Shinji entered the room.
"当然，美里。"明日香回答道，暗自窃笑。'第一阶段启动！'明日香心中暗想，此时真嗣走进了房间。

"Straight to work, Shinji, it's about lunchtime. I want to check your progress before that," Misato said, giving the boy a wink. Shinji smiled at his guardian's behavior and exited the kitchen with Asuka, beelining for the machines sitting in the living room.
"直接开工吧，真嗣，快到午饭时间了。我想在吃饭前检查一下你的进度。"美里说着，向男孩眨了眨眼。真嗣对监护人的举动报以微笑，与明日香一同离开厨房，直奔客厅里待命的机器而去。

"Okay," Shinji said, turning to Asuka. "What's your plan?"
好的，" 真嗣转向明日香问道，"你的计划是什么？

"I'm glad you asked, Shinji!" Asuka replied, hands on her hips. "Step One is quite simple. We just work the dance as normal, and just mess up as we did before. But we'll be working on it properly as well. Mess up though, I kind of want to have a go at you. It's fun." Asuka said, laughing to herself.
"很高兴你问了，真嗣！" 明日香回答道，双手叉腰。"第一步很简单。我们就按正常方式练习舞蹈，像之前那样故意出错。但同时我们也会认真练习。虽然要故意出错，但我有点想找你麻烦。挺有趣的。" 明日香说着，自顾自地笑了起来。

"Of course." Shinji replied, moving towards his mat, preparing for the mission ahead. "As long as you let me have a go at you at some point."
当然。" 真嗣回应着，走向自己的垫子，为即将到来的任务做准备。"只要你也让我有机会找你麻烦就行。

"You'll get a chance." Was all Asuka said as they both settled into their positions. They started their routine, as they normally did, matching each other much better than they were yesterday after their evening the day before. Then Asuka purposely started to speed up, and Shinji purposely started to lose his balance.
"你会有的。" 明日香只是这么说道，两人随即各就各位。他们开始像往常一样进行训练，比昨天晚上之前配合得要好得多。接着，明日香故意加快了节奏，而真嗣则故意开始失去平衡。

"Baka Shinji!" Asuka called out, giving Shinji a good kick to the side. "You made me mess up again!"
笨蛋真嗣！" 明日香喊道，顺势给了真嗣一脚。"你又让我搞砸了！

"Again!?" Shinji replied, getting up as well, matching Asuka's smirk with his own. "You were the one that was speeding up! Did you not remember anything about what Misato said yesterday!"
又是我！？" 真嗣也站起身来，用同样的坏笑回应明日香。"明明是你加速了！你忘了昨天美里说什么了吗！

"Are you blaming me, Baka? How dare you! Obviously, I'm the one staying in time, and you're the one that's falling behind!" Asuka replied, trying as hard as she could to not break into laughter.
"你敢怪我，笨蛋？好大的胆子！明明是我跟上了节奏，而你却在拖后腿！" 明日香回答，努力忍住不笑出声。

"Me!" Shinji replied, also trying his hardest not to burst into laughter. "I'm the one falling behind?"
我！" 真嗣也极力忍住笑意。"我拖后腿？

"Yes!" Asuka groaned. "You also have no balance at all, I don't understand how you are ever going to finish this task that we have set before us!"
是的！"明日香抱怨道，"你平衡感也这么差，真不明白我们怎么可能完成这个任务！

"Both of you shut up!" Came Misato's annoyed tone as she quickly entered the room, a glare on her face. "You have three days to complete this task, so get to work and stop arguing! We don't have time for this!" Misato sighed, exiting the room quickly, rubbing her head in annoyance.
"你们俩都闭嘴！"美里不耐烦地走进房间，脸上带着怒色，"你们只有三天时间完成这个任务，赶紧干活，别吵了！我们没时间浪费！"美里叹了口气，迅速离开房间，边走边揉着额头，显得很烦躁。

Asuka grinned and subtly high-fived Shinji. She watched as Misato left the room. "Yes! Stage One completed! Now it's time for Stage 2!"
明日香咧嘴一笑，悄悄地和真嗣击了个掌。她看着美里离开房间，"太好了！第一阶段完成！现在进入第二阶段！"

"When do we start Stage 2?" Shinji asked, wondering what Asuka's next plan was.
"我们什么时候开始第二阶段？"真嗣问道，好奇明日香的下一步计划是什么。

"Well, we just have to wait until lunch, as we're going to get into a war while we're cooking the dishes."
嗯，我们只能等到午饭时再说了，到时候一边做饭一边开战。

"Why are we specifically doing that?" Shinji asked, raising an eyebrow at her in wonder at exactly what Asuka's plan was.
"为什么非得这么做呢？" 真嗣问道，好奇地扬起眉毛，想知道明日香到底有什么计划。

"Because I wanted three steps and I could only think of that." Asuka replied, shrugging. "Don't think too much about it, we have to annoy Misato! Now, let's just get back to this and annoy Misato even more by actually doing it mostly correctly." She said, and the duo went back to practicing on the mats – albeit deliberately failing.
"因为我只想到了这个，需要三个步骤。" 明日香回答，耸了耸肩。"别想太多，我们得让美里心烦！现在，我们继续这么做，而且要尽量做得正确，这样更能激怒美里。" 她说完，两人便回到垫子上继续练习——尽管故意搞砸。

Misato wandered into the room an hour later, where Shinji and Asuka continued to practice their routine in silence, not noticing that Misato had entered the room and was watching them intently. Asuka messed up, she growled slightly but said nothing, and the duo quickly restarted their routine afterwards. Misato watched in confusion, she was fully expecting Asuka to freak out and go off at Shinji as she usually did, but they just silently continued their routine as if nothing had happened.
一小时后，美里走进房间，真嗣和明日香仍在默默练习他们的动作，并未察觉美里已经进来，正专注地观察着他们。明日香失误了，她轻声咆哮却未发一言，随后两人迅速重新开始他们的动作。美里困惑地看着，她本以为明日香会像往常一样爆发，对真嗣大发雷霆，但他们只是默默地继续练习，仿佛什么都没发生。

'Those two are so confusing,' She thought to herself as Shinji messed up again. They were getting better, she couldn't deny that, but it was starting to get very annoying when they would get so close but then mess up.
'那两个人真是让人摸不着头脑，' 她暗自思忖，因为真嗣又搞砸了。他们的确在进步了，这点她无法否认，但每当他们眼看就要成功却又搞砸时，开始变得非常恼人。

"Alright!" She called out, getting the two children's attention. "Let's take a break, you guys go make lunch if you want." Asuka and Shinji nodded and left towards the kitchen, "Err, Misato-san, could you come with us?" Shinji asked nervously as Asuka instructed him.
"好了！" 她大声说道，吸引了两个孩子的注意。"咱们休息一下，你们要是愿意就去准备午饭吧。" 明日香和真嗣点头，朝厨房走去，"呃，美里小姐，您能跟我们一起来吗？" 真嗣紧张地问道，明日香在一旁指挥着。

"What for?" Misato raised an eyebrow, she didn't know the boy well, but from the looks of it the kid had a good heart.
"为什么？" 美里挑了挑眉，她对这个男孩了解不多，但从表面看，这孩子心地善良。

"Well, I was thinking, since you cook for yourself, we…hmmm…one more helping hand would be grateful!" Shinji improvised; Asuka barely suppressed a laugh.
"嗯，我在想，既然您自己做饭，我们…呃…多一双帮忙的手会很感激的！" 真嗣临时编了个理由；明日香差点笑出声来。

Misato pondered for a moment. "Can't hurt, I guess." However, there was something else in her mind that made her agree.
碇真嗣沉思了片刻。“应该没什么坏处，我想。”然而，她心中还有别的原因促使她同意。

Asuka grinned over at Shinji, "Round 2 is a go!" She whispered excitedly, leading the boy and the bid sister into the kitchen to carry out the second phase.
明日香朝真嗣咧嘴一笑，“第二轮开始！”她兴奋地低声说道，领着男孩和姐姐走进厨房，开始执行第二阶段计划。

As the trio entered the kitchen, Misato suddenly spoke, "Now, what are you two doing?" She asked, suspicion in her eyes.
三人刚踏入厨房，碇真嗣突然开口，“你们俩在搞什么名堂？”她问道，眼中闪烁着怀疑。

"What do you mean, Misato?" Asuka feigned ignorance. "We're not doing anything. How can you think that we're doing anything weird?"
“什么意思，碇真嗣？”明日香装作不知情。“我们什么也没做啊。你怎么会觉得我们在做奇怪的事呢？”

"You guys are so strange. Your relationship should be strange and weird yet you get along swimmingly. You can try and make it look otherwise but I can tell that you both get along very well with each other." Misato said, looking between Shinji and Asuka. "And we've gotten to the point now where when one of you are doing something, generally, both of you would be. So, I ask again, what are you doing?"
你们俩真奇怪。明明关系应该很别扭才对，却相处得异常融洽。你们或许想装作不是这样，但我看得出来，你们彼此之间相处得非常好。" 美里一边说，一边来回打量着真嗣和明日香。"而且现在发展到，只要你们其中一个在做什么，通常另一个也会参与。所以，我再问一次，你们到底在做什么？

"Asuka's right, Misato." Shinji replied, glancing at the redhead beside him. "We aren't doing anything strange, we're just working hard, like you told us to." Shinji said, hiding his smile as best as he could.
"明日香说得对，美里。" 真嗣回答道，瞥了一眼身旁的红发少女。"我们并没有做什么奇怪的事，只是像你吩咐的那样，努力工作而已。" 真嗣尽力掩饰着笑容说道。

"Well, okay…" Misato said, not really believing them but moving on. "So, after lunch you guys will have more training. You're getting somewhere but you still aren't completely finished with the routine yet, you still have a bit to go. If you're getting somewhere and you don't argue with each other while practicing, then I'll let you do what you want for an hour before dinner. Understood?"
好吧，那就算了……" 美里说，虽然并不完全相信他们，但还是继续说道。"那么，午饭后你们还要继续训练。虽然有所进展，但还没有完全完成训练计划，还有一段路要走。如果你们能有所进步，并且在练习中不互相争吵，那么晚饭前我会让你们自由活动一小时。明白了吗？

"Yes, Misato." Shinji and Asuka replied, simultaneously, something that was happening far more often since they'd started their training. Misato saw this as a good sign, it showed her that two kids were getting somewhere with their training. It would only be a matter of time before they would complete their training and get to a point where they would be able to sync their thoughts well enough to pass the test.
"是的，美里。" 真嗣和明日香同时回答，自从他们开始训练以来，这种情况越来越频繁。美里认为这是个好兆头，表明两个孩子正在训练中取得进展。不久之后，他们就能完成训练，达到能够充分同步思维的程度，从而通过测试。

Shinji went to deal with the meat as usual, while Asuka headed for the vegetable section. Misato simply sat on a chair – not that she was lazy – and kicking her legs as she watched the Children work together with satisfaction.
真嗣像往常一样去处理肉类，而明日香则走向蔬菜区。美里只是坐在椅子上——并非她懒惰——晃动着双腿，满意地看着孩子们协同工作。

Just as she thought everything would be okay, things started to go south.
就在她以为一切都会顺利时，情况开始急转直下。

"Ouch! Shikinami!" Asuka cried out, wanting to slap the boy beside her. "Don't let the hot oil splash on me!"
哎呀！式波！" 明日香叫道，想要拍打旁边的男孩。"别让热油溅到我身上！

"Kind of hard not to do that, Asuka, when you're standing so close to the stove!" Shinji shot back, equaling her intensity with his own. "In case you haven't noticed, I can't move the stove, and it's you who chose this spot!"
你站得离炉子这么近，很难不这样啊，明日香！" 真嗣回敬道，语气与她同样激烈。"如果你没注意到的话，我可挪不动炉子，而且是你选的这个位置！

"Are you blaming me again, Shikinami?!" Asuka barked, a frown on her face.
"你又在怪我了吗，式波？！" 明日香厉声反驳，眉头紧锁。

"I'll have you know that you're the one doing the things wrong here!" Shinji shouted.
"我告诉你，这里做错事的是你！" 真嗣大声喊道。

"Wanna bet!?" Asuka challenged.
"敢打赌吗！？" 明日香挑衅道。

"This came from you I'll have you know!" Shinji stood his ground.
"这可是你搞出来的，你给我记好了！" 真嗣毫不退让。

"Are you saying this was my fault!?" Asuka threatened.
"你是说这都是我的错吗！？" 明日香威胁道。

"Yes, I am! Yes, I am, Shikinami!" Shinji pushed.
"没错，就是你的错，式波！" 真嗣逼近一步。

Asuka moved into Shinji's space once again, intending to faking a slap when Misato walked in and pulled them away from each other. "Please, both of you, for the love of all that is holy, stop arguing!" Misato said, glancing between both of them, as they tried to grab at each other again. "This is petty and annoying! Stop this now or I'll make you eat cafeteria food!" She threatened.
明日香再次逼近真嗣，正欲假意挥掌，这时美里走了进来，将两人拉开。"拜托了，你们俩，看在老天的份上，别吵了！" 美里在两人之间来回扫视，他们还想再次互相抓扯。"这太幼稚了，烦死了！立刻停下，否则我就让你们吃食堂的饭！" 她威胁道。

The Children shot each other one last glare before returning to their work.
孩子们互瞪最后一眼后，各自回到自己的工作中。

Misato sighed in response to their fighting. 'How am I going to get them to stop fighting for five minutes?' She asked herself, as she exited the kitchen and headed to her room. She needed a beer…again.
面对他们的争吵，葛城美里叹了口气。'我怎么才能让他们停止争吵哪怕五分钟呢？' 她自问着，离开厨房走向自己的房间。她又需要一瓶啤酒了……

"Round 2 is a success!" Asuka cried out in excitement, giving the boy a high-five. Shinji responded in kind, laughing with her.
"第二轮成功了！" 明日香兴奋地喊道，与男孩击掌。真嗣也回应着，与她一同笑了起来。

"So, what's Round 3 then?" Shinji asked, tilting his head to the side, wondering what Asuka's next idea in her plan was.
"那么，第三轮是什么？" 真嗣侧头问道，好奇明日香计划中的下一个点子是什么。

"Round 3 is simple. After lunch we'll have to perfect our dance routine first, then when Misato checks on us, we'll mess up intentionally, then when she started to get mad, we'll perform a perfect round. Just mess with her head!"
第三轮很简单。午饭后我们先要完善舞蹈动作，等美里来检查时，故意搞砸，等她开始生气时，我们再完美表演一次。就是要让她摸不着头脑！

"I assume… we'll be training hard in the afternoon? Without Misato knowing?" Shinji asked, flipping the meatballs.
"我猜……下午我们要偷偷加练？不让美里知道？" 真嗣边翻着肉丸边问道。

"Right in one, Shinji!" Asuka replied, winking at him.
"答对了，真嗣！" 明日香回答道，朝他眨了眨眼。

Two hours of secret training later
秘密训练两小时后

Asuka stood on the machine and getting ready to go. "Are you ready, Shinji?"
明日香站在机器上，准备出发。“你准备好了吗，真嗣？”

"Yeah!" Shinji replied, getting into position as well and letting the music flow through their ears. They started their movements quickly, staying in time and in unison until about halfway through, where the problems started to come into place.
“好了！”真嗣回应道，也进入位置，让音乐流淌进他们的耳朵。他们迅速开始动作，保持同步和一致，直到大约一半的时候，问题开始出现。

"Shinji!" Asuka cried out, taking in his movements in annoyance. "You're behind again! You need to jump higher there as well!"
“真嗣！”明日香喊道，恼火地观察着他的动作。“你又落后了！那里你也需要跳得更高！”

"Asuka, calm down!" Shinji replied, causing Asuka to stop the song and turn to the boy.
“明日香，冷静点！”真嗣回答，这让明日香停止了音乐，转向男孩。

"Listen, Shinji…" She said, glancing at him. "You're klutzy and too slow! We need to settle this rhythm together!" Asuka huffed, "I'm going to use the bathroom! You'd better not try to peek!" Shinji just shrugged in response.
"听着，真嗣…" 她瞥了他一眼说道，"你笨手笨脚的，动作还慢！我们得把节奏协调好！" 明日香气呼呼地说，"我去洗手间了！你最好别偷看！" 真嗣只是耸了耸肩作为回应。

"Asuka! How many times do I have to tell you and Shinji to stop arguing!?" Misato asked, walking into the room. "I could hear you through two layers of walls!"
明日香！我都告诉过你和真嗣多少次了，别再吵了！" 美里走进房间问道，"隔着两层墙我都听得见你们的声音！

"One more I think." Shinji cheekily replied, giving Misato a smile.
"我想再来一次吧。" 真嗣调皮地回答，对美里露出了笑容。

"Okay, well tell Asuka that that's enough. I don't want any more arguing." Misato said, wondering where the girl was. "Where is Asuka?"
好吧，那你告诉明日香，够了。我不想再听到任何争吵。" 美里说着，纳闷那女孩去哪儿了。"明日香在哪儿呢？

"She's in the bathroom." Shinji said, heading that way as well. "I'll tell her when she comes out." He said, walking out of the living room.
"她在洗手间。" 真嗣说着，也朝那边走去。"她出来我就告诉她。" 他边说边走出了客厅。

"Good, because I want to talk to you two after you're both done, okay?" Misato said, letting Shinji know that she was very concerned about their arguments.
"好，因为我想等你们俩都完事了再谈谈，行吗？" 美里说，让真嗣知道她对他们争吵的事非常关切。

"Alright!" Shinji called out, standing outside of the bathroom. "Misato wanted to talk to both of us after you came out of the bathroom, I don't think she's very happy with how we've been acting today…"
好的！" 真嗣站在洗手间外喊道，"美里想等你出来后和我们俩谈谈，我觉得她对我们今天的表现不太满意……

Asuka sighed, exiting the bathroom, running a hand through her hair. "I thought so…" Asuka replied. "I guess we don't have much of a break anymore, don't we?"
明日香叹了口气，从洗手间出来，用手捋了捋头发。"我也这么想……" 明日香回应道，"看来我们也没什么休息时间了，不是吗？"

"I'd say so…" 我想是的…

Asuka grinned slightly, stepping into the room where Misato was waiting for her.
明日香微微一笑，走进了美里正在等她的房间。

"There you are, Asuka." Misato said, a can of beer in her hands. "So, have you and Shinji stopped fighting?"
你来了，明日香。"美里说道，手里拿着一罐啤酒。"那么，你和真嗣不吵架了吧？

"Yes, Misato." Asuka replied, her grin in full force. "We have stopped fighting. Don't worry, we'll work hard towards completing our training for your test."
是的，美里。"明日香回答道，笑容满面。"我们不吵架了。别担心，我们会努力完成你的测试训练的。

"I should hope so." Misato said, sipping her beer. "Because, you two have been fighting non-stop all day. What is happening here? Neither of you is showing me that we can pass the test in two days."
我倒是希望如此。" 美里说着，啜了一口啤酒。"因为你们俩一整天都在不停地争吵。这里到底是怎么了？你们俩都没让我看到我们能在两天后通过测试的迹象。

Asuka suddenly started laughing, as Shinji entered the room after using the bathroom. Misato was completely confused. "What?" She asked Shinji, who just smiled at her. "Want to start Asuka?" Shinji asked, turning to the girl, who was trying (and failing) to get her laughter under control.
当真嗣从洗手间回来进入房间时，明日香突然笑了起来，美里完全摸不着头脑。"怎么了？" 她问真嗣，后者只是对她微笑。"想开始吗，明日香？" 真嗣转向那个女孩，她正试图（但失败了）控制自己的笑声。

"Yeah, let's do this," Asuka calmed down, walking to her dance mat; Shinji stood on his seconds later. The music sounded, and the pair started dancing in sync. It was flawless. They moved as one. Misato had never seen anything like this in her life – even the professional dancers she saw on TV wouldn't stand a chance against these two in terms of precision and synchronization.
"好，我们开始吧。" 明日香平静下来，走向她的跳舞毯；几秒钟后，真嗣也站到了自己的跳舞毯上。音乐响起，两人开始同步跳舞。完美无瑕。他们动作一致。美里一生中从未见过这样的景象——即使是她在电视上看到的职业舞者，在精确度和同步性上也比不上这两个人。

With the final beat ended, the Children stopped, the scoreboard showed a perfect 100 percent.
随着最后一拍结束，孩子们停了下来，记分牌显示了完美的 100%。

Misato watched in awe, mouth agape, "wow," was the only thing she could articulate after 10 seconds of silence.
美里目瞪口呆地望着，十秒的沉默后，她只能吐出一个字：“哇。”

"So, basically, I decided I wanted to get back at you after using Rei yesterday, and telling me that I could easily be replaced by her in this mission. I told Shinji the plan and we tried to annoy you as much as possible today just for payback!"
“所以，简单来说，我昨天利用了绫波，你还告诉我，我在这任务中很容易被她取代。我告诉了真嗣这个计划，我们今天就尽量惹你生气，就是为了报复！”

"Seriously, Asuka!" Misato replied, her annoyance with her two charges coming through. "Your entire point behind today's arguments, and themes-ups was just to make a point!"
“真是的，明日香！”美里回应道，她对这两个孩子的不满显而易见。“你们今天所有的争吵和挑衅，就是为了证明这一点！”

"Essentially." Asuka replied, her grin still on his face.
“差不多吧。”明日香回答，脸上的笑容依旧不减。

"Gods, you kids will be the death of me one day…" Misato muttered, sipping her beer again. "Look, I'm not annoyed with you two." She started, causing both teens to glance up at her. "I just need you two to understand the seriousness of this situation. I'm happy with the final result, despite your arguing…" Misato finished her beer, tossing it towards the recycling in the corner. "Now, Shinji, I believe we need some dinner soon?" Misato asked, big sister Misato coming out once again. She'd scolded her charges, and now she was going to be her usual relaxed self.
"天哪，你们这些孩子总有一天会要了我的命……" 美里嘟囔着，又喝了一口啤酒。"听着，我并不是对你们俩生气。" 她开口说道，让两个少年都抬头看向她。"我只是需要你们明白这个情况的严重性。尽管你们争吵不休，我对最终结果还是满意的……" 美里喝完了啤酒，随手将空罐扔向角落的回收箱。"那么，真嗣，我想我们很快就需要吃晚饭了吧？" 美里问道，再次展现出她作为姐姐的一面。她已经训斥过她的两个小家伙，现在她又要恢复到平常那种轻松自在的状态了。

"Asuka, go with Shinji, you're still training, remember." Misato told the girl with a smile on her face. Asuka sighed as she left the room, grabbing two bottles of water, following Shinji to the Geofront's kitchen. "Hey." Asuka said, sitting down beside the boy, handing him a bottle of water. "Misato's still on training mode, so we can't get away from each other yet."
明日香，跟真嗣一起去吧，你还在训练期，记得吗。" 美里带着微笑对女孩说道。明日香叹了口气，离开房间，抓起两瓶水，跟随真嗣前往第三新东京市的地下都市厨房。"嘿。" 明日香说着，坐到男孩旁边，递给他一瓶水。"美里还在训练模式，所以我们暂时还不能分开行动。

"That's alright," Shinji replied. "At least I'm doing this thing with you."
没关系，" 真嗣回答道，"至少我现在是和你一起做这件事。

Asuka blushed a bit as she took in Shinji's words. "You wouldn't want to do this with Rei?" She asked, taking a sip of the water, leaning back against the wall, thinking about her conversation with Rei days before.
听到真嗣的话，明日香脸上泛起一丝红晕。“你难道不想和绫波一起做这件事吗？”她问道，一边喝着水，一边靠在墙上，回想起几天前与绫波的对话。

"It's not that I don't like her," Shinji replied. "It's just that… you're probably the most normal and relaxed about this. I don't know her as well as I know you, I guess I'm more comfortable doing this with you."
“并不是我不喜欢她，”真嗣回答，“只是……你在这件事上可能是最正常、最放松的。我对她的了解不如对你，我想我跟你一起做这件事更自在些。”

"Yeah," Asuka replied, glancing at him out of the corner of her eye. Shinji had no idea how much better his words had made Asuka feel. "I'm glad that I'm doing this with you as well. I don't want to do this with anyone else – boys or girls. I don't know, I just feel the most comfortable with you."
“嗯，”明日香应道，用眼角余光瞥了他一眼。真嗣不知道他的话让明日香感觉好多了。“我也很高兴能和你一起做这件事。我不想和别人——无论是男生还是女生——一起做。我不知道，我就是觉得跟你在一起最舒服。”

It was now Shinji's turn to blush. Just several days earlier, the girl beside him was telling him to fuck off, and now he was the person she felt the most comfortable with. He was really making progress. They sat in silence until night fell completely and the darkness of the night overcame them. After half an hour, they stopped, getting up together and heading into the food storage room, and started cooking dinner together.
轮到真嗣脸红了。就在几天前，身边的女孩还让他滚蛋，而现在他却成了她最感舒适的人。他真的在进步了。他们静静地坐着，直到夜幕完全降临，黑暗笼罩四周。半小时后，他们起身，一同走进食品储藏室，开始一起准备晚餐。

The night came and Shinji was in a semi-conscious state. Just as he was about to slip into the dreamland, he was woken up by the sound of a rustling blanket. He wasn't exactly irritated, but definitely not happy. He was facing the other way, and decided to shut his eyes close tightly, trying to sleep.
夜幕降临，真嗣处于半梦半醒之间。正当他即将沉入梦乡时，一阵窸窣的毯子声将他唤醒。他并未感到恼怒，但也绝非愉悦。他背对着声音来源，决定紧闭双眼，试图再次入睡。

He could hear Asuka getting up from her bed, and entered the bathroom. He sighed in relief as he thought this wouldn't take long and he could go back to sleep. After flushing the commode, the door opened and the light turned off. Shinji quickly closed his eyes, waiting for her to go back to her bed. He could hear her footsteps getting closer and closer as she made her way across the room. Then as the noise of her footsteps reached a peak, they came to a stop. Suddenly he could feel movement in front of him as Asuka's body fell next to his.
他能听见明日香从床上起身，走进了浴室。他松了一口气，心想这不会花太长时间，自己很快就能继续睡觉。冲水声后，门开了，灯也熄了。真嗣迅速闭上眼睛，等待她回到自己的床铺。他能听到她的脚步声越来越近，穿过房间。当脚步声达到顶点时，突然停了下来。紧接着，他感觉到面前有动静，明日香的身体倒在了他旁边。

He wanted to gasp, but he didn't want to wake her up. Her eyes were sealed shut, and she seemed completely unaware that she was in his bed. Shinji thought about nudging her awake, but he wasn't quite sure how she'd react to that. Then she started to move, inching her face closer to his, practically touching his nose with her own. He could feel her breath on him, and he was certain that she could feel his just because of how hard he was breathing. However she remained at ease.
他想喘口气，却又怕吵醒她。她的双眼紧闭，似乎全然不知自己正躺在他的床上。真嗣考虑过轻轻推醒她，但又拿不准她会有何反应。这时，她开始动了，脸庞缓缓贴近他的，几乎要与他的鼻尖相触。他能感受到她的呼吸，而他也确信，自己急促的呼吸同样能被她察觉。然而，她依旧安然无恙。

Shinji found that he had lost control over his own movement, and his hormones had started moving his body on its own. He found Asuka really cute like this – in this vulnerable state, contrary to her usual harsh and cocky personality.
真嗣发现自己已无法控制自己的动作，荷尔蒙开始驱使他的身体自行其是。他觉得这样的明日香真的很可爱——在这种脆弱的状态下，与她平时尖锐且自负的性格截然相反。

Little did he know, it was Asuka's ultimate test for him. He didn't know he was the first person she felt comfortable enough to give the test to, either. Well, except Kaji that was.
他并不知道，这是明日香对他最终的考验。他也不清楚，他是她感到足够安心，愿意给予考验的第一人。哦，除了加持之外。

'She looks so peaceful…' Shinji looked at her face, and her lips. 'She just looks so beautiful…' Shinji moved slowly towards Asuka's slightly puckered lips with his own. But before he could kiss her, Asuka's body tensed up as her heart sank, disappointed with his behavior, and a few tears threatened to escape her eyelids.
'她看起来如此安详……' 真嗣凝视着她的面庞，她的双唇。'她只是看起来如此美丽……' 真嗣缓缓地向明日香微微噘起的唇靠近自己的。但就在他即将吻上她时，明日香的身体突然紧绷，她的心沉了下去，对他的行为感到失望，几滴泪水在她的眼睑下挣扎着要溢出。

Shinji stopped dead in the tracks; looking at Asuka's face again, he sighed and moved away. 'I know I want to kiss her, like the girl in my dreams, but I know she'd never forgive me if I did…and she wouldn't understand either…' "Sorry, Asuka…" Shinji whispered.
真嗣突然停下脚步；再次看向明日香的脸，他叹了口气，移开了视线。'我知道我想吻她，就像梦中的那个女孩一样，但我知道如果我这么做，她永远不会原谅我……她也不会理解……' "对不起，明日香……" 真嗣低声说道。

"Baka, Shinji…" Asuka muttered in response.
"笨蛋，真嗣……" 明日香低声回应。

Shinji stared at Asuka. 'Is she awake?' Shinji thought, but Asuka's slow breathing however proved otherwise to him. Shinji cautiously got up from the bed, trying his best not to wake her up, and slumped down on Asuka's bed.
真嗣盯着明日香。'她醒了吗？' 真嗣思索着，但明日香缓慢的呼吸却向他证明并非如此。真嗣小心翼翼地从床上起身，尽力不惊醒她，然后颓然坐在明日香的床上。

He didn't see the failed-to-suppress smile that graced his roommate's lips.
他并未察觉到室友唇边那抹难以抑制的微笑。

"Hello, Shinji Ikari," the cloaked prophesier appeared in the void, "are we...safe from disturbances today?"
你好，碇真嗣，"那位身披斗篷的预言者出现在虚空中，"今天我们...能免受打扰吗？

"I guess, we aren't using the chip anymore," Shinji replied, "well...we'll start with my questions like usual, right?"
我想，我们不再用那芯片了，"真嗣回答道，"那么...我们还是像往常一样，先从我的问题开始，对吧？

The prophesier chuckled, "yes. You're learning, both here and in reality."
预言者轻笑一声，"没错。你在这里和现实中都在学习。"

Shinji blushed - it was praise from a God, he thought he should at least feel a little proud for himself, "t-thanks. I wanna ask though...Asuka was really pissed with me just days before, but now she's suddenly nice. I mean, I don't mind it, but may I at least get some...insights? I-err-"
真嗣脸红了——这可是来自神的赞誉，他觉得自己至少应该感到一丝自豪，“谢、谢谢。不过我想问……几天前明日香还对我大发雷霆，现在却突然变得和善。我的意思是，我并不介意，但能否至少给我一些……解释？我、呃——”

"You're afraid of it's some kind of game she's playing with you, right?" The prophesier interrupted, seeing Shinji nodded, he continued, "well, normally this would seem odd. However, in your case it's different. Did she mention anything about...comfortable around you?"
“你担心这是她在跟你玩什么把戏，对吧？”预言家打断道，见真嗣点头，他继续说，“嗯，通常这会显得奇怪。但你的情况不同。她有没有提到过……在你身边感到舒适？”

"Yeah, she said she's most comfortable with me," Shinji replied.
“是的，她说在我身边最自在。”真嗣回答。

"Great. That means..." the prophesier pondered for a second, "even if the mind forgets, the heart remembers," he said, "that's her heart making the decision."
“很好。这意味着……”预言家沉思片刻，“即使心智遗忘，心灵仍会铭记，”他说，“这是她的心在做出选择。”

Shinji felt a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders, "I guess I understand now...thanks."
真嗣感到肩上的重担突然减轻了，“我想我现在明白了……谢谢。”

The next morning was a little awkward, as both Shinji and Asuka didn't bring up how they exchanged beds during the night. To Shinji's surprise Asuka seemed to be in a good mood – few people have good spirits just after getting up.
第二天早上有些尴尬，因为真嗣和明日香都没有提起夜里交换床铺的事。令真嗣惊讶的是，明日香似乎心情不错——很少有人在刚起床时还能保持好心情。

The day passed quickly as the Children practiced their dance several more times, all of them finished with 100 percent sync scores. After a small conversation, Dr. Naoko Akagi decided to do the test in advance. Since the Children were already synced with each other completely, there's no point in delaying the test anymore.
那天过得很快，孩子们又练习了几次舞蹈，所有人的同步率都达到了百分之百。经过简短的交谈后，赤木博士决定提前进行测试。既然孩子们已经完全同步，再推迟测试就没有意义了。

"Get ready you guys, I hope the training yields results," Naoko said into the channel, "start phase one connection."
“大家准备好了，希望训练能有成效，”直子通过频道说道，“开始第一阶段连接。”

Maya started typing on the keyboard, "first-level connection established," she reported, "should we continue?"
玛雅开始敲击键盘，"一级连接已建立，" 她报告说，"要继续吗？"

"Continue the test." 继续测试。

"Hai. Begin second phase."
海。开始第二阶段。

In the entry plugs both Asuka and Shinji focused on their thoughts based on their choreographed movements – though not really dancing it out. "Wow," Naoko exclaimed, "great! Their brain waves are at the same phase and showing perfect constructive interference!" 'And it's matching Lilith's perfectly!' She thought to herself.
在入口处，明日香和真嗣专注于根据编排的动作思考——尽管并没有真正地跳舞。"哇，"直子惊叹道，"太棒了！他们的脑波处于同一相位，显示出完美的相长干涉！"她心中暗想，'而且与莉莉丝的完全吻合！'

Just at that moment, both Shinji and Asuka's visions went white.
就在那一刻，真嗣和明日香的视野变得一片空白。

Shinji slowly opened his eyes, finding him standing in an unfamiliar hallway. The smell of disinfectants and alcohol telling him he was likely in a hospital. "What is this place?" Shinji wandered around – then he found a familiar but not so familiar redhead, standing in front of a large window.
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己站在一条陌生的走廊里。消毒水和酒精的味道告诉他，这里很可能是一家医院。"这是什么地方？"真嗣四处徘徊——然后他发现了一个熟悉却又不太熟悉的红发女孩，站在一扇大窗户前。

"Asuka?" Shinji walked closer. "She's…so young," Shinji murmured after looking closely at the girl. The little Asuka paid no attention to his arrival, Shinji shrugged – then what's happening inside the room caught his attention.
"明日香？"真嗣走近了些。"她……好年轻，"真嗣仔细打量女孩后喃喃自语。小明日香对他的到来毫无察觉，真嗣耸了耸肩——随后，房间内发生的事情吸引了他的注意。

A woman who also had red hair was lying on the bed, holding a doll in her hand. Shinji could hear her saying, "Asuka dear…die with me…"
床上躺着一位同样红发的女子，手中紧握着一个玩偶。真嗣能听到她喃喃自语：“明日香亲爱的…和我一起死去吧…”

"What the hell is that?!" Shinji was intimidated by the scene. Looking down at the little Asuka, he could see tears threatening to come out from the corner of her blue eyes. 'Is this… Asuka's memory?' He thought. Suddenly feeling empathetic to the girl, he said, "Hello?" he patted little Asuka's shoulder.
“这到底是什么鬼东西？！”真嗣被这一幕吓到了。他低头看着小小的明日香，只见她蓝色的眼角似乎有泪珠在打转。‘这难道是…明日香的记忆？’他暗自思忖。突然对这女孩心生同情，他轻声问道：“你好？”并轻拍了拍小明日香的肩膀。

Little Asuka sniffed, "wh-who are you?" She looked at Shinji.
小明日香抽了抽鼻子，“你…你是谁？”她抬头看向真嗣。

"Emm, I'm Shinji, Shinji Ikari," he replied, "are you alright?" His socially-awkward brain couldn't really come up with something else at the moment.
“呃，我是真嗣，碇真嗣，”他回答道，“你还好吗？”他那社交笨拙的大脑此刻实在想不出别的词来。

However, little Asuka seemed to calm down instantly, "Shinji!" She exclaimed, wrapping her arms around the confused boy, "I-I don't want to be alone! Do-don't leave me!"
然而，小明日香似乎立刻平静了下来，“真嗣！”她惊呼着，紧紧抱住困惑的男孩，“我-我不想一个人！别-别丢下我！”

Shinji raised an eyebrow, didn't know what exactly to do at the moment. He followed his instinct and stroked through little Asuka's hair. "Errr, don't worry? I mean, I'm not leaving, at least for now…" Little Asuka's hair was soft and silky, Shinji quickly started liking the sensation. He kept stroking her hair, trying his best to comfort the girl.
真嗣挑了挑眉，一时不知该如何是好。他凭直觉轻抚着小明日香的头发。“呃，别担心？我是说，我不会离开，至少现在不会……”小明日香的头发柔软顺滑，真嗣很快就喜欢上了这种感觉。他继续抚摸着她的头发，尽力安慰着女孩。

"Shinji?" Little Asuka called out, pointing to a glowing door several meters beside them, "what is that?"
“真嗣？”小明日香叫道，指向他们旁边几米处一扇发光的门，“那是什么？”

Shinji looked over, "hmm, maybe it wants us to open it?" Little Asuka nodded, "alright then," little Asuka grabbed Shinji's wrist and dragged him to the door. 'Even little Asuka is like this,' Shinji thought, sweatdropping.
真嗣望过去，“嗯，可能是想让我们打开它？”小明日香点点头，“那好吧，”她抓住真嗣的手腕，拉着他走向那扇门。‘连小明日香也这样，’真嗣心想，不禁汗颜。

Asuka opened her eyes, found herself standing in the middle of a platform. She looked around and quickly identified the surroundings as a railway station. The platform was empty and only a small human silhouette standing in the middle of it. "What is this place?" Asuka walked to the kid, "This is Shinji? Why is he so…small," she wondered?
明日香睁开眼睛，发现自己站在一个站台上。她环顾四周，很快辨认出这里是一个火车站。站台上空无一人，只有一个小小的人影站在中间。“这是什么地方？”明日香走向那个孩子，“这是真嗣吗？他怎么这么…小，”她心中疑惑？

Little Shinji cried, "(sob) papa! Don't leave me alone!"
小真嗣哭喊着，“（抽泣）爸爸！别丢下我一个人！”

Asuka felt irritated by the childishness of Shinji and smacked his back, "you're a man aren't you? What are you crying about?"
明日香对真嗣的孩子气感到不耐烦，拍了一下他的背，“你不是男孩子吗？哭什么哭？”

Little Shinji turned his head to Asuka, "Waa! A scary big sister is hitting me!"
小真嗣转头看向明日香，“哇！一个可怕的大姐姐在打我！”

Asuka blinked, "You brat! Who are you calling scary big sister?!" She barked, "listen up, I am the celebrated EVA pilot, the great Soryu Asuka Langley!"
明日香眨了眨眼，“你这小鬼！谁是你说的可怕大姐啊？！”她厉声道，“听着，我是赫赫有名的 EVA 驾驶员，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！”

Little Shinji stopped crying, and stared at Asuka with a faint blush and admiring look. "What are you looking at?" Asuka asked, her temper fading as she felt something stir in her heart caused by the look.
小真嗣停止了哭泣，带着一丝红晕和钦佩的目光凝视着明日香。“你看什么看？”明日香问道，她的脾气随着那目光在她心中激起的一丝涟漪而逐渐消退。

"After a closer look, you're so beautiful, are you an angel?" Little Shinji said.
“仔细一看，你真美，你是天使吗？”小真嗣说道。

Asuka raised an eyebrow, "what did you say?"
明日香挑了挑眉，“你说什么？”

"I read beautiful angels are all like you, golden hair with blue eyes!" Little Shinji said.
"我听说美丽的天使都像你这样，金发碧眼！"小真嗣说道。

Asuka blushed, "idiot, I'm not an Angel," she sweatdropped, "but I'll take that you think I'm pretty, huh?"
明日香脸红了，"笨蛋，我又不是天使，"她尴尬地流汗，"不过，算你识相，觉得我漂亮吧？"

"Yeah!" Little Shinji nodded with a warm smile.
"嗯！"小真嗣点头微笑，温暖如春。

Asuka half-laughed, "well, brat Shinji is kinda…cute, really," she smirked, lifting little Shinji into the air, who smiled happily, stretching his arms to make a flying impression.
明日香半笑半嗔，"好吧，小鬼真嗣倒是挺……可爱的，真的，"她嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，把小真嗣举到空中，他开心地笑着，张开双臂做出飞翔的样子。

"Say, Asuka," little Shinji suddenly said, "what is that thing over there?"
喂，明日香，"小真嗣突然问道，"那边那个是什么东西啊？

"Huh?" Asuka looked over and found a glowing door, "what is that? Well, might as well check it out." She lifted little Shinji again and carried him to the door, opened it, and stepped inside.
"嗯？"明日香望过去，发现了一扇发光的门，"那是什么？算了，去看看吧。"她再次抱起小真嗣，走向那扇门，打开它，然后迈了进去。

"What is going on there?" Misato asked worriedly, "the kids are not responsive!"
那边发生什么事了？"美里焦急地问道，"孩子们没有反应了！

"From the readings, their minds are fusing together," Naoko said, looking at the readings on her terminal, "their brain waves are identical to another; thus their minds couldn't distinguish which is which."
从数据显示来看，他们的意识正在融合，"直子看着终端上的读数说，"他们的脑电波完全一致，以至于他们的意识无法区分彼此。

"What's going to happen to them?!" Misato said, dropping cold sweat.
"他们会有什么事吗?!" 三佐说着，额上渗出冷汗。

"Don't worry, they might be wandering in each other's mind world right now, nothing harmful may happen," Naoko reassured, "technically they are not seeing each other's memories – but trapped inside the illusions created by their subconscious, in English, a dream." She explained, "it might take a while for them to figure out each other and come back to reality."
别担心，他们现在可能正在彼此的意识世界中徘徊，不会有什么危险的，" 直子安慰道，"严格来说，他们并非在观看对方的记忆——而是被困在了由潜意识创造的幻象中，用英语说就是梦境。" 她解释说，"他们可能需要一段时间才能了解对方并回到现实。

Misato sighed in relief, 'I hope they're alright…'
三佐松了口气，心想：'希望他们没事……'

Shinji and Asuka stood in the middle of a grassland, beside them was a huge cypress tree. Little Shinji and Asuka glared at each other, daring the other one to steal the teenage Shinji and Asuka from them.
真嗣和明日香站在一片草地中央，旁边是一棵巨大的柏树。小小的真嗣和明日香互瞪着对方，挑衅着谁先从对方那里夺走少年真嗣和明日香。

"This is incredible," Asuka said, looking at the younger pair, "what's up with this odd world?" She mused, then decided to change the subject, "Shinji, you look cute when you're young! And he is a better sweet-talker than you!"
这太不可思议了，" 明日香看着那对年幼的两人说道，"这个奇怪的世界是怎么回事？" 她沉思着，然后决定换个话题，"真嗣，你小时候看起来真可爱！而且他比你更会甜言蜜语呢！

Shinji chuckled nervously, "well, you're as bossy as your younger self…"
真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，"嗯，你跟小时候一样强势……"

"What was that?!" Asuka glared at Shinji, pinching his ear, "say that again and you'll be a dead man!"
你说什么？！" 明日香瞪着真嗣，捏住他的耳朵，"再说一遍，你就死定了！

"So-sorry!" Shinji hastily replied, "won't do that again!"
对-对不起！" 真嗣急忙回答，"不会再有下次了！

"Hmph," Asuka huffed, giving his ear small mercy, "I mean, when I met little Shinji, you were…hmm, not in a good shape." She paused, afraid of the answer she might get for her next question, "when you met the little me…what did you see?" She gulped nervously.
"哼，" 明日香哼了一声，稍微放过了他的耳朵，"我是说，当我遇到小真嗣时，你那会儿……嗯，状态不太好。" 她停顿了一下，害怕自己接下来可能得到的答案，"你遇到小时候的我时……你看到了什么？" 她紧张地咽了口唾沫。

Shinji scratched his head, "well, you were…" he met Asuka's gaze – uncertain and nervous, although he knew what he saw was probably not things that Asuka wanted anyone to know, he also didn't want to lie. He would feel guilty if he didn't tell Asuka. "Erm, in the hospital, you were…you almost cried for your mom? I mean-"
真嗣挠了挠头，"嗯，你那时……" 他迎上了明日香的目光——既不确定又紧张，尽管他知道自己所见的可能不是明日香希望任何人知道的，但他也不想撒谎。如果他不说出真相，他会感到内疚。"呃，在医院里，你……你差点因为想妈妈而哭出来？我是说——"

Asuka visibly paled hearing those words, her mood darkened in an instant as old memories resurfaced. She turned around, her back facing Shinji, "can you forget what you saw?"
听到这些话，明日香的脸色明显苍白，她的情绪瞬间变得阴沉，旧日的记忆涌上心头。她转过身去，背对着真嗣，"你能忘记你看到的吗？"

"Asuka?" Shinji said cautiously.
"明日香？" 真嗣小心翼翼地问道。

"Leave me alone," Asuka said in a dangerously low voice, "or I'll hurt you."
别烦我，" 明日香用一种危险低沉的声音说道，"否则我会伤害你。

"Sorry, Asuka, I-" 对不起，明日香，我——

"Leave. Me. Alone," Asuka hissed out every word.
"别。来。烦。我，" 明日香一字一顿地嘶声说道。

Shinji had two conflicting ideas in his mind. First and foremost, he wanted to run. It was understandable since any person under the same situation would probably just walk away – she made it clear what she wanted. Not to mention Asuka was known to be violent, which means she would probably hurt people for real. However, another voice in his head was telling him to stay. The battleground was at a stalemate, with the runaway side slowly taking over, fueled by the murderous aura Asuka was emitting.
真嗣心中有两种矛盾的想法。首先，他想逃跑。这是可以理解的，因为在同样的情况下，任何人可能都会选择离开——她已经明确表达了她的意愿。更不用说明日香以暴力著称，这意味着她真的可能会伤害人。然而，他脑海中还有另一个声音告诉他留下。内心的战场陷入了僵局，逃跑的一方逐渐占据上风，被明日香散发出的杀气所推动。

Then he remembered what the prophesier told him – 'Don't leave her' – as well as what little Asuka said to him. The battle was over in an instant.
这时，他记起了预言者的话——“别离开她”——还有小明日香对他说的话。战斗转瞬即逝。

Mustering all the courage he had – braver than the first time he stepped into an EVA, he said, "No."
他鼓起所有的勇气——比第一次踏入 EVA 时还要勇敢，他说：“不。”

Asuka took a sharp breath. She had been alone for most part of her life – and she was perfectly fine with that. She thought it's okay for her to be alone. She didn't need anyone.
明日香深吸了一口气。她一生中的大部分时间都是孤身一人——对此她早已习以为常。她认为独自一人也无妨，她不需要任何人。

The truth was, she didn't want to be alone. However, she knew if she let anyone close to her, they will hurt her by running away once they see the real her – the scared little girl, pleading for help, crying for momma.
事实上，她并不想孤单。然而，她知道如果让任何人靠近，一旦他们看到真实的她——那个害怕的小女孩，乞求帮助，哭喊着要妈妈——他们就会逃离，从而伤害她。

Now though, there was one person – Shinji, who just saw her darkest moments, who saw the real her – he didn't run away, instead he chose to help the little Asuka, and refused to leave when she told him to. Did that mean-
然而现在，有一个人——真嗣，他目睹了她最阴暗的时刻，看到了真实的她——他没有逃跑，反而选择帮助小小的明日香，并在她让他离开时拒绝离开。这是否意味着——

No. Maybe he was willing to help her. Maybe he won't run away like everybody else did. But he couldn't understand. She didn't want sympathy. He couldn't understand what it felt like to lose your mother – and then abandoned by your father-
不。或许他愿意帮助她。或许他不会像其他人那样逃跑。但他无法理解。她不需要同情。他无法理解失去母亲——然后被父亲抛弃的感受——

'But he COULD understand,' a voice in her mind said, 'did you already forget what he said? He hated his father because he abandoned him. He lost his mother as well. He was also an EVA pilot. You've probably been through hell and came back together. Not to mention he was probably the only one in this world who could understand you since you both woke up on the beach, having lost nine months of memory. He's just like you. It wouldn't be sympathy – it's empathy.'
'但他确实能理解，'她脑海中的声音说道，'你已经忘了他说过的话吗？他恨他的父亲，因为他抛弃了他。他也失去了母亲。他也是 EVA 的驾驶员。你们可能一起经历了地狱般的磨难。更不用说，自从你们在海滩上醒来，失去了九个月的记忆后，他可能是这个世界上唯一能理解你的人。他就像你一样。这不是同情——这是共情。'

Asuka spun around and leaped at Shinji, catching him off guard and pinned him on the ground. She looked into Shinji's eyes, who looked away under the pressure of her soul-piercing glare. "Look at me," she said in an unreadable voice.
明日香猛地转身，向真嗣扑去，趁其不备将他按倒在地。她凝视着真嗣的眼睛，后者在她的目光下压力重重地移开了视线。"看着我，"她用一种难以捉摸的声音说道。

Shinji took a deep breath and returned his gaze – cobalt eyes met blue eyes. Shinji was never good at reading people's emotions; however, he could still see a lot behind the cerulean. Confusion, anger, hate, hesitation, and just slightly – appreciation.
真嗣深吸一口气，重新迎上对方的目光——钴蓝色的眼睛与湛蓝的眼睛相遇。真嗣向来不擅长解读人的情感，然而，他仍能从那片蔚蓝中窥见许多：困惑、愤怒、憎恨、犹豫，以及微乎其微的——感激。

"Why?" Asuka asked after a long silence. The younger pair just stood there transfixed as the whole ordeal displayed in front of them.
"为什么？" 长时间的沉默后，明日香开口问道。两个年轻人只是站在那里，目不转睛地看着眼前上演的这一幕。

"Be-because," Shinji swallowed, trying to think something to say that wouldn't sound so lame, "I-I want to help you," seeing Asuka blink, he quickly added, "I also want you to help me! I-I lost my mother at a young age as well, Asuka," he sighed, "I can't remember what happened, she's just…gone. And my father abandoned me immediately," Asuka's glare softened hearing the revelations, "I…I-sorry, I-"
因、因为，" 真嗣咽了口唾沫，试图想出一些不那么蹩脚的话来，"我、我想帮助你，" 看到明日香眨了眨眼，他急忙补充道，"我也希望你能帮助我！我也是在很小的时候就失去了母亲，明日香，" 他叹了口气，"我记不清发生了什么，她就那样……消失了。而我的父亲立刻抛弃了我，" 听到这些揭露，明日香的目光柔和了下来，"我……我、对不起，我——

"Don't say anything," Asuka interrupted him, releasing Shinji and standing up, "thanks." She murmured after turning around, not unnoticed by Shinji, who simply smiled a small smile.
"什么都别说，" 明日香打断了他，松开真嗣并站起身来，"谢谢。" 她转过身后低声说道，并未逃过真嗣的注意，他只是微微一笑。

"Alright, we've got enough information," Naoko closed her laptop, "terminate the test."
好了，我们掌握的信息足够了。"直子合上笔记本电脑，"终止测试。

"Hai," Maya replied, typing on the keyboard.
"是。"玛雅应声，手指在键盘上敲击。

In the entry plugs Shinji and Asuka simultaneously woke up – Shinji felt liberated; he didn't know how much he did would improve their relationship, but he knew it was one step in the right direction. Asuka woke up in a relaxed mood, a genuine smile graced her lips once she remembered what happened in the dreamland. She would thank the idiot in her own way.
在插入栓中，真嗣和明日香同时醒来——真嗣感到一种解脱；他不清楚自己所做的一切能多大程度改善他们的关系，但他知道这是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。明日香醒来时心情轻松，当她回忆起梦境中的情景时，嘴角不由自主地挂上了真心的微笑。她会用自己的方式感谢那个笨蛋。

The Children left the plug and headed towards the changing room, Asuka following Shinji closely behind. Just as Shinji was about to enter the changing room, he was called out by the redhead, "hey idiot, come here for a moment."
孩子们离开插入栓，向更衣室走去，明日香紧跟在真嗣身后。就在真嗣即将进入更衣室时，他被红发少女叫住了，"喂，笨蛋，过来一下。"

Shinji stopped in his tracks, "Asuka?"
真嗣停下脚步，“明日香？”

One second later he could be a perfect example of a deer caught in the headlights as he felt another warm body pressed against his, a pair of hands resting on his back, pulling him close. He could also feel Asuka's female assets firmly pressed against his chest, but strangely he didn't have any perverted thoughts in his mind. He simply enjoyed the warmth and contact, and he wanted it to last forever-
一秒后，他就像是被车灯惊吓到的鹿一样，感受到另一个温暖的身躯紧贴着自己，一双柔荑轻放在他的背上，将他拉近。他也能感觉到明日香的女性特征紧紧压在胸前，但奇怪的是，他心中并无一丝邪念。他只是享受着这份温暖与接触，希望这一刻能永恒。

"If somebody's holding you, you're supposed to hold them back, Baka," Asuka murmured. Shinji blushed a faint blush and slowly raised his arms to Asuka's waist, carefully placing them above her hips, not daring to touch anything. Asuka let out a contented sigh, "Thanks, idiot," she muttered, "for being there for me when I needed it the most."
“如果有人抱着你，你应该回抱对方，笨蛋。”明日香低声说道。真嗣脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，缓缓抬起手臂环住明日香的腰，小心翼翼地放在她的髋部上方，不敢触碰其他地方。明日香发出一声满足的叹息，“谢谢你，傻瓜，”她喃喃道，“在我最需要的时候陪在我身边。”

Shinji blushed a little more as Asuka's ticklish breath blew past his ears, "y-you're welcome?"
明日香轻柔的呼吸拂过耳畔，真嗣的脸颊又添了几分红晕，“不、不客气？”

Asuka released the hug and walked away, giving Shinji a last friendly smile before disappearing into the female changing room.
明日香松开拥抱，转身离去，在消失于女更衣室前，对真嗣露出了最后一个友好的微笑。

Still mild-shocked on what just happened, Shinji changed and went back to his living quarters in silence, his own smile never left his face.
仍处于刚才那一幕的轻微震惊中，真嗣默默地换了衣服，带着未曾消退的笑容回到了自己的住处。

The atmosphere of Gendo's office sank as twelve black monoliths emerged from darkness, while the said man kept his cold expression.
源渡的办公室气氛凝重，十二块黑色巨碑自黑暗中显现，而这位男子依旧保持着他那冷漠的表情。

"Well, The Two certainly met our expectations," SEELE 01 spoke first as usual, "at this rate we can initiate the contact experiment the next month."
“嗯，The Two 确实符合我们的预期，”SEELE 01 一如既往地率先开口，“照这样下去，我们下个月就可以开始接触实验了。”

"Dr. Akagi also reported something worthy of noting," SEELE 03 said, "The Two were talking about 'piloting an EVA.' Do any of you gentlemen have any idea of what is an EVA?"
阿卡吉博士还报告了一项值得注意的内容，" SEELE 03 说道，"那两人在谈论'驾驶 EVA'。诸位先生中，有人知道 EVA 是什么吗？

SEELE 01 to 12 replied one after another, and none of them could think of anything useful.

"Well, maybe we need to eavesdrop on them more," Gendo Ikari finally said.
"嗯，或许我们需要更多地监听他们，" 碇源堂最终开口道。

"Have we got any new information?" SEELE 01 asked.
"我们有没有获得什么新情报？" SEELE 01 询问道。

"No," Gendo replied, "The Two stopped using the chip we were using to eavesdrop."
不，" 源渡回答道，"The Two 停止使用我们用来监听的芯片了。

"Find another way, then," SEELE 05 said, annoyed, "insert something during the next physical examination or something like that. I believe Gehirn has such capabilities."
那就另寻他法，" SEELE 05 不悦地说，"下次体检时设法植入点什么，或者类似手段。我相信 Gehirn 有这个能力。

"Indeed," Gendo said, "however, we're afraid The Two may possess supernatural powers that can sense any form of monitoring. That may be the real reason why they stopped using it."
确实如此，" 源渡说，"但我们担心 The Two 可能拥有能感知任何监控形式的特异功能。这或许正是他们停止使用芯片的真正原因。

"Play your cards safe, Ikari," SEELE 01 spoke, "we need to know about The Two as much as possible – but we can't undermine their trust in us for now."
谨慎行事，碇，" SEELE 01 开口道，"我们需要尽可能多地了解 The Two —— 但目前还不能破坏他们对我们的信任。

### Chapter 7: I can't swim?
我不会游泳？

"Shinji, pack your stuff, we're moving out. You don't have to go to school today, came Kaji Ryoji's excited voice just as Shinji finished making breakfast. It had been four days since the test – Asuka hadn't come back to school yet due to her suspension. Shinji spent some more time with Toji and Kensuke, while Asuka simply used the spare time to do more shopping. She needed to fill her wardrobe with clothing collection, after all.
"真嗣，收拾东西，我们要搬家了。你今天不用去学校，" 就在真嗣刚做好早餐时，加持良治兴奋的声音传来。自从那次测试已经过去了四天——由于被停学，明日香还没有回学校。真嗣多花了些时间和东治、剑介在一起，而明日香则利用空闲时间继续购物。毕竟，她需要充实自己的衣橱。

"Huh? Moving out?" Shinji asked, raising his eyebrow, "you mean… we're gonna live elsewhere?" Even though it had been only four days, Shinji had been feeling somewhat empty inside without the company of the redhead. For four whole days he hadn't even seen her once – since he needed to go to school, and Gehirn didn't give the Children more tests. He wasn't sure about whether she felt the same way, but the prophesier's words were a big assurance. Still, he anticipated his relocation –
"啊？搬家？" 真嗣问道，扬起眉毛，"你是说……我们要搬到别的地方去住？" 尽管只过了四天，真嗣却感到内心有些空虚，没有红发少女的陪伴。整整四天，他甚至一次都没见到她——因为他需要上学，而 Gehirn 也没有再给孩子们安排测试。他不确定她是否也有同样的感觉，但预言者的话给了他很大的安慰。尽管如此，他还是期待着搬家——

"Yup," Kaji confirmed with a smile, "we're going to live above the ground. This place - as nice as it is - is kinda stagnant. Not to mention the 40 minutes train ride every time getting in or out."
没错，" 加持笑着确认道，"我们要搬到地面上居住。这个地方——虽然不错——但有点死气沉沉。更别提每次进出都要坐 40 分钟的火车。

"Right," Shinji set up the table and put down the breakfast, which Kaji wasted no time starting to eat. "Thanks," he said, "you're welcome." Shinji replied, before digging into his own portion.
"好的，" 真嗣摆好桌子，放下早餐，而加持则毫不迟疑地开始吃起来。"谢谢，" 他说，"不客气。" 真嗣回答后，也开始享用自己的那份。

After breakfast both Kaji and Shinji started packing their own stuff. Shinji looked at his wardrobe that contained several sets of school uniforms, seven pairs of trousers and underwear of different kinds, some T-shirts, socks, and sleeping attires – all the clothing he got. The SDAT he and Asuka used for training laid on the table, its specially designed chip removed. Shinji kept it for his personal entertainment. All of his belongings, plus some manga and other gadgets, fitted well in a medium-sized delivery box.
早餐过后，加持和真嗣都开始收拾自己的东西。真嗣看着自己的衣柜，里面有几套校服，七条不同款式的裤子和内衣，一些 T 恤、袜子和睡衣——这些都是他的全部衣物。他和明日香用于训练的 SDAT 放在桌上，特制的芯片已被取出。真嗣保留它作为个人娱乐。他所有的物品，加上一些漫画和其他小玩意，刚好能装进一个中等大小的快递箱。

As for Kaji it was a different story. The unshaven man clearly paid much more attention to his appearance than Shinji – he owned as many clothes as Misato's beer storage; the formal wears alone stuffed one of his wardrobes in his old apartment. This was another reason he's so eager to move out as soon as possible – Geofront's living quarters were small, he needed a real apartment so he could put all of his stuff together.
至于加持，情况则大不相同。这位未刮胡子的男人显然比真嗣更注重外表——他拥有的衣物数量堪比美里储存的啤酒；光是正装就塞满了他旧公寓中的一个衣柜。这也是他急于尽快搬出去的另一个原因——第三新东京市的居住空间狭小，他需要一个真正的公寓，以便将所有物品集中存放。

Shinji panted heavily as he and Kaji loaded their belongings onto the truck and got in Kaji's car, then the truck driver drove off to Kaji's old apartment to pick up his other stuff. "Where are we going?" Shinji asked as they waited in the car train.
真嗣气喘吁吁地帮着卡兹将行李装上卡车，随后坐进卡兹的车里，卡车司机便驱车前往卡兹的旧公寓取其余物品。"我们要去哪儿？" 真嗣在等待列车时问道。

"To our new home," Kaji replied with an expectant look, "take a guess! Where is it?"
去我们的新家，" 卡兹满怀期待地回答，"猜猜看！在哪儿？

The truth was Shinji had already had a rough idea and anticipation of where they were going, "Erm, we're going to live with Misato?" He didn't say Asuka since he didn't want to sound creepy – but it was the most logical conclusion from Kaji's expression and his own wishful thinking.
其实真嗣心中已隐约有了猜测和期待，"呃，我们要和美里一起住吗？" 他没有提及明日香，以免显得唐突——但从卡兹的表情和自己的一厢情愿来看，这是最合理的推断。

Kaji chuckled, "thinking about living with two young women, eh Shinji-kun? Not to mention one of them is who you like," he said with a sly grin, making Shinji blush, "close, but not entirely correct. We are going to live the next door."
卡兹轻笑道，"想着和两位年轻女士同住，是吧，真嗣君？更别提其中一位还是你心仪的对象，" 他狡黠地笑着，让真嗣脸颊泛红，"接近了，但并不全对。我们是去隔壁住。"

Shinji wasn't really disappointed. His Japanese etiquette was telling him it's inappropriate to live with a girl his age in the same room, after all. The only reason he anticipated it was the fact that they were living together when they were still EVA pilots. "I see. I mean, one apartment has no enough space for four people, right?"
真嗣其实并没有太失望。毕竟他的日本礼仪告诉他，与同龄女孩同住一室是不合适的。他之所以有所期待，只是因为他们曾是 EVA 驾驶员时曾同住一屋。“原来如此。我的意思是，一套公寓怎么可能住得下四个人呢，对吧？”

"Yup," Kaji answered, "actually, it was Asuka who demanded you living near them when…she heard that you'll be looking for a new place to live,"
“没错，”加持回答道，“实际上，是明日香在听说你要找新住处时，要求你住得离他们近一些。”

The day after the test, Katsuragi Residence
测试后的第二天，葛城家

"Kaji! What the hell are you doing here?!" Misato opened the door and saw the unshaven spy, "I don't have time to deal with you, you know!"
“加持！你在这儿搞什么鬼？！”美里打开门，看到满脸胡茬的间谍，“我没空搭理你，你知道的！”

"I'm hurt," Kaji said with his classic lady-killing smile, to which Misato simply snorted – she had seen him do this numerous times and already developed resistance, "however, I'm here for some actual business," seeing Misato's glare softened, he continued, "I'm looking for an apartment to live in, since the accommodation is so small. I can barely put half of my clothes there."
我受伤了，" 薰带着他那招牌式的迷人微笑说道，对此，美里只是嗤之以鼻——她已经见过他多次这样，早已产生了免疫力，"不过，我来这儿是有正事的，" 看到美里的目光有所缓和，他继续说，"我在找一间公寓住，因为现在的住处太小了。我的衣服一半都放不下。

"Well, most of the rooms in this apartment building are empty – actually, Gehirn had already bought the whole complex, and this building will be Gehirn employees exclusive soon," Misato said, "for safety reasons."
嗯，这栋公寓楼里大部分房间都空着——实际上，Gehirn 已经买下了整个综合体，这栋楼很快就会成为 Gehirn 员工的专属地，" 美里说，"出于安全考虑。

"Wait, Thir-Shinji's finding a new place to live?" Came the redhead, wearing a casual outfit, "actually, you guys can live the next door."
等等，十三——真嗣在找新住处？" 红发少女穿着休闲装问道，"其实，你们可以住隔壁。

Kaji was also thinking about the same thing; however, he wanted to know the reasons behind the redhead's enthusiasm. He wouldn't want that Asuka wanted them to live the next door just because she would have more time to flirt with Kaji. "Well, what for?" He asked.
薰也在考虑同样的事情；然而，他想知道红发少女如此热情的原因。他可不希望明日香让他们住隔壁只是因为她能有更多时间与薰调情。"哦，为什么呢？" 他问道。

Asuka's eyes wandered around, "well, it's simple. Misato's cooking is shit, and I'm sick eating takeout every day, not to mention I have to eat cafeteria junk in school. Since Shinji is a good cook, I reckon it would be convenient to have him living the next door, nothing more!" She looked in Misato's direction, who murmured an inaudible retort.
明日香的目光四处游移，“嗯，很简单。美里做的饭太难吃了，而且我厌倦了天天吃外卖，更别提学校食堂的垃圾食品了。既然真嗣做饭好吃，我想他住隔壁应该挺方便的，仅此而已！”她朝美里的方向瞥了一眼，后者低声嘟囔了一句听不清的反驳。

Kaji was professional in reading people's thoughts through their tone and facial expression – but Asuka was hard to read. He could sense she was partially honest in her reasons, but there were more to it which she didn't want to admit. Nonetheless, Kaji was relieved that she wasn't using her sweet schoolgirl tone when talking to him, as well as not trying to get his attention through – for example, 'accidentally' showing some cleavage. "Well, fair enough," he said, turning around, "I'll make the arrangements as soon as possible."
加持擅长通过语气和表情洞察人心——但明日香却难以捉摸。他能感觉到她的理由部分属实，但背后还有更多她不愿承认的东西。尽管如此，加持还是松了口气，因为她没有用甜美的女学生腔调跟他说话，也没有试图通过——比如说，“不小心”露出一些乳沟来吸引他的注意。“好吧，说得过去，”他说着转过身去，“我会尽快安排的。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow hearing Kaji's words, "she…actively…I mean, she asked for that?" His dense brain didn't know what it meant, but he was sure this wasn't a bad sign, "why would she do that?"
听到加持的话，真嗣挑了挑眉，“她……主动……我是说，她要求那样？”他那迟钝的大脑不明白这意味着什么，但他确信这不是个坏兆头，“她为什么要这么做？”

Kaji chuckled, "well, I'd say she really likes you," he looked at Shinji with an unreadable expression, "I suppose you know what she did to the boys in the school. I've read some of the reports I got from Misato," his eyes narrowed just by a little bit, "say, Shinji, what did you do? Did you cast spells on her? Even me had hard times comprehending her behavior," he said with a tingle of confusion, "what did you do to change her from trying to murder you to actively pushing closer to you?"
加持轻笑一声，“嗯，我得说她真的很喜欢你，”他看着真嗣，表情难以捉摸，“我想你应该知道她在学校里对那些男生的所作所为。我看过一些从美里那里得到的报告，”他的眼神微微一紧，“我说，真嗣，你做了什么？对她施了什么魔法吗？连我都难以理解她的行为，”他带着一丝困惑说道，“你是怎么让她从试图杀害你变成主动接近你的？”

Shinji sweatdropped, 'I can't just say I had help from a God, can I? I mean, if I acted like myself, she would probably have murdered me already,' he sighed internally, "I… don't know? It's not a bad thing, is it?"
真嗣尴尬地流汗，心想：‘我总不能说我得到了神的帮助吧？如果我保持本色，她可能早就把我杀了，’他内心叹息，“我……不知道？这不是坏事吧？”

"From what I can see, she's genuine at wanting to get closer to you," Kaji replied, "I'm not sure how far she wants to go, though."
“就我所见，她是真心想和你亲近，”加持回答，“不过我不确定她想亲近到什么程度。”

They reached the surface, and Kaji drove the car onto the road. It was a sunny mid-May day, people jogged along both sides of the street as working hours were getting closer. Shinji and Kaji chatted about other stuff as they drove closer to Misato's apartment building.
他们抵达地面，加持驱车驶上道路。那是五月中旬一个阳光明媚的日子，随着工作时间的临近，人们沿着街道两侧慢跑。真嗣和加持在驶向美里公寓楼的途中聊起了其他话题。

Kaji's driving was a bit more subdued, but still more reckless than Shinji would have liked. Kaji pulled into the parking lot with an elegant drift that rivaled Baby Driver. Shinji grabbed his bag that had his entertainment stuff in it and headed to their apartment with Kaji.
加持的驾驶风格略显收敛，但仍比真嗣所期望的要鲁莽。加持以一个优雅的漂移驶入停车场，堪比《极盗车神》中的场景。真嗣抓起装有娱乐用品的背包，与加持一同前往他们的公寓。

"Hey, Baka," Asuka greeted him when Shinji walked to his apartment door, "you'd better not slack off on today's lunch – your cooking is…acceptable," she said halfheartedly and entered her apartment.
"喂，笨蛋，"当真嗣走向自己的公寓门时，明日香向他打招呼，"你今天中午可别偷懒——你的厨艺嘛……还算过得去，"她半心半意地说着，走进了自己的公寓。

Shinji wasn't even able to greet back – he felt tightness in his chest at Asuka's cold attitude. He sighed and entered his own apartment to clean up – the delivery could be here at any moment.
真嗣甚至来不及回应——明日香的冷漠态度让他胸口一阵紧缩。他叹了口气，走进自己的公寓准备收拾——快递随时可能送达。

Asuka closed the door behind her and took a deep breath. Damn, how could the great Asuka Langley Soryu be nervous about something so trivial? She was always confident and committal! She didn't know why she asked Kaji to bring Shinji to live next to her and Misato. Maybe she only wanted to have good food every day. Maybe she wanted to get closer to Shinji, like he said – to help him. Maybe she needed his help. Maybe they could start a-
明日香关上门，深吸了一口气。该死，伟大的明日香·兰格雷·索西尔怎么会因为这么点小事而紧张？她向来自信果断！她不明白自己为何让加持带真嗣来与她和美里同住。或许她只是想每天吃到美味的食物。或许她想像真嗣所说的那样，与他更亲近——去帮助他。或许她也需要他的帮助。或许他们可以开始一段……

The Asuka Train of Thought derailed before it could approach the romantic relationship station. She had never thought about it before except Kaji – and that was out of the window now. She didn't exactly grow out of it – she still thought this Kaji handsome and manly, but she knew she had zero chance. Not to mention her crush on Kaji was mainly caused by him taking care of her – his appearance and maturity were just bonus points. Since this Kaji didn't seem like care about her, then she might as well move on. If she continued to try to flirt with him, he might start to avoid her – she reckoned they could at least be on friendly terms.
明日香的思绪列车在驶向恋爱关系站之前就脱轨了。她以前从未考虑过这些，除了对加持的感情——而那已是昨日黄花。她并非真的放下了——她仍觉得加持帅气有男人味，但深知自己毫无机会。更别提她对加持的迷恋主要源于他的照顾——他的外表和成熟不过是加分项。既然这个加持似乎并不在乎她，那她还不如放手。如果她继续试图与他调情，他可能会开始躲避她——她认为他们至少可以保持友好关系。

However, that particular thought had been nagging her for the past few days - about a specific boy. She didn't know what was going on in her mind – it's not like they knew each other for a long time! They just met each other for a bit more than a week! She had her dignity!
然而，最近几天，某个特定的念头一直困扰着她——关于一个特别的男孩。她不明白自己脑子里在想什么——他们又不是相识已久！他们才认识不过一个多星期！她也有自己的尊严！

'Don't lie to yourself,' a voice in her head sounded, 'how many times do I need to repeat? You met each other before. You were EVA pilots. You two probably shared the most part of the nine months of memory you both lost. The comfort you always feel around him? It's possibly caused by that.'
'别再自欺欺人了，'她脑海中的声音响起，'要我重复多少遍？你们之前就见过。你们都是 EVA 驾驶员。你们俩很可能共同拥有那九个月失忆期的大部分记忆。你总在他身边感到的安心？这可能就是原因。'

Asuka sighed in defeat. 'What do I want him to be?'
明日香无奈地叹了口气。'我到底希望他成为什么？'

Kaji and Shinji settled in their new apartment, with Kaji having the master bedroom while Shinji got the smaller one. They've both got windows and good ventilation, as well as built-in wardrobes. The delivery truck came hours later, and the duo moved their belongings into their room with the help of Misato and Asuka. Asuka was reluctant to help at first, but she changed her idea after a conversation with Shinji.
加持和真嗣搬进了新公寓，加持住主卧，而真嗣则住较小的房间。两人房间都有窗户和良好的通风，还配有内置衣柜。几小时后，搬家卡车到了，在美里和明日香的帮助下，两人将各自的物品搬进了房间。起初明日香并不情愿帮忙，但与真嗣交谈后她改变了主意。

"Asuka! You aren't even carrying the big boxes! Just a little help is fine!" said Kaji, frustrated by the attitude of the redhead. He thought she was changing for better after she actively asked Shinji to move to the next door, but it seemed he was wrong.
"明日香！你连大箱子都没搬！稍微帮点忙也好啊！" 加持对红发少女的态度感到沮丧。他本以为自从她主动提出让真嗣搬到隔壁后，她会有所改变，但现在看来他错了。

"Why should I? It's not my stuff," Asuka retorted; in fact, she didn't really want to antagonize Kaji, but she was kinda lazy to help to move the boxes. Suddenly she thought of a way to resolve the situation while benefitting herself, "hey Shinji," the called boy turned his attention to her, "I will help you…if you make what I want for today's lunch, sounds fair?"
凭什么我得帮忙？又不是我的东西，"明日香反驳道；其实她并不想与加持对立，只是懒得帮忙搬箱子。突然，她灵机一动，想到了既能解决问题又能让自己得利的办法，"喂，真嗣，"她叫道，被叫到的男孩转头看向她，"我帮你搬…条件是你今天得做我想吃的午饭，这样公平吧？

Shinji gave a small smile, "sure. What do you want, Asuka?"
真嗣微微一笑，"当然可以。你想吃什么，明日香？"

"Can you make German dishes? Do you know what's Sauerkraut?" Asuka asked, clapping her hands together in anticipation, "I really want to have this today."
你会做德国菜吗？知道什么是酸菜吗？"明日香满怀期待地问，双手合十，"我今天特别想吃这个。

"Well, I only know how to make Baumkuchen," Shinji said, embarrassed, "and I don't know what Sauerkraut even is."
嗯，我只会做年轮蛋糕，"真嗣有些尴尬地说，"至于酸菜是什么，我完全不知道。

Asuka raised an eyebrow, "wait, you know how to make Baumkuchen?" Seeing Shinji nodded slowly, she continued, "well, I want that as well! As for Sauerkraut, it's just German pickled cabbage," she explained.
明日香挑了挑眉，“等等，你会做年轮蛋糕？”见真嗣缓缓点头，她接着说，“那我也要那个！至于酸菜，就是德国泡菜而已，”她解释道。

"Oh, I can make that," Shinji smiled, "so I make Sauerkraut for lunch, and Baumkuchen in the afternoon, you help me move my belongings - deal?"
“哦，我会做那个，”真嗣微笑着说，“那我中午做酸菜，下午做年轮蛋糕，你帮我搬东西——成交？”

"Deal," Asuka said happily, "I'm looking forward to it, don't disappoint me. Or someone will get hurt," She said half-threateningly, walking to the stack of boxes.
“成交，”明日香开心地说，“我很期待，别让我失望。否则有人会受伤的，”她半带威胁地说着，走向那堆箱子。

Kaji watched the whole ordeal and smiled an invisible smile, "She can be nice when she wants to be… you're right, Shinji, she's very interesting. I'll see what I can do to help you."
加持在一旁看着整个过程，脸上挂着不易察觉的微笑，“她想对人好的时候还是挺好的……你说得对，真嗣，她很有趣。我会看看能帮你做些什么。”

With the help of an enthusiastic redhead, four people quickly finished the job and went to do their respective things. Shinji immediately started making lunch since noon was approaching, Asuka went to play her newly bought console, Kaji tried to flirt with Misato, who did everything she could to ignore him.
在一位热情红发人的帮助下，四人迅速完成了工作，各自忙活起来。真嗣立刻开始准备午餐，因为正午将至；明日香则去玩她新买的游戏机；加持试图与美里调情，而美里则尽其所能地无视他。

To Shinji's surprise his first time making Sauerkraut went as well as it could be. It's like he knew exactly when to do what, as well as the portioning of condiments. He felt the process was somehow engraved in his subconscious.
令真嗣惊讶的是，他第一次制作酸菜竟然出奇地顺利。仿佛他清楚地知道何时该做什么，以及调料的分量。他感觉这个过程似乎早已刻印在他的潜意识中。

"Hm, not half bad," Asuka commented after the first bite – in fact, she was flabbergasted by the food. It was just her tsun in the way preventing her from saying how she truly felt.
“嗯，还不错嘛，”明日香尝了第一口后评论道——实际上，她被这食物惊艳到了。只是她那傲娇的性格让她无法坦白自己的真实感受。

Which was amazing. 简直是美味至极。

"I'm glad you like it, Asuka," Shinji smiled a small smile, "and thanks for the help again."
我很高兴你喜欢，明日香，" 真嗣微微一笑，"再次感谢你的帮助。

Misato and Kaji complimented his cooking as well, in a more enthusiastic way. Shinji felt good to be praised.
美里和加持也对他的厨艺赞不绝口，态度更为热情。受到表扬的真嗣感到很开心。

Misato gave Kaji a spare keycard to her apartment, who reciprocated. Although one could climb over the balcony to the other side, it was too dangerous to do so. Misato strictly prohibited such behavior, much to Asuka's dissatisfaction. Not that she's going to listen, though.
美里给了加持一张她公寓的备用门卡，加持也回赠了一张。虽然可以从阳台爬到另一边，但这样做太危险了。美里严格禁止这种行为，这让明日香颇为不满。不过，她可不打算听话。

Thursday morning 星期四早晨

"…nji! Get up!" ……真嗣！起床了！

Shinji slowly opened his eyes – and had a strange feeling. He was alone in the room when he fell asleep last night, but now he could feel the presence of another person. His shoulder was being clutched and shook by somebody, and said person had blue eyes and red hair, which emitted a faint smell of strawberry shampoo-
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛——一种奇异的感觉涌上心头。昨晚入睡时房间里明明只有他一人，此刻却能感受到另一个人的存在。他的肩膀正被人紧握并摇晃着，那人有着蓝色的眼睛和红色的头发，散发着淡淡的草莓味洗发水香气——

"Asuka?!" Shinji almost cried out and was silenced by a finger put on his lips instantly. "Don't shout! They're still sleeping!"
明日香?!" 真嗣几乎要喊出声来，却被对方立刻按在唇上的手指止住了。"别叫！他们还在睡呢！

Shinji nodded, and Asuka removed her finger, "what are you doing here?" He asked, confused. "What's the time now?"
真嗣点了点头，明日香移开了手指，"你在这里做什么？" 他困惑地问道，"现在几点了？"

"6 a.m., half an hour before your alarm sounds," Asuka replied.
"早上六点，比你的闹钟响还要早半小时，" 明日香回答道。

"How did you get here?" Shinji frowned, surprised that the redhead was willing to get up so early, "what are you doing here early in the morning?" He asked, yawning.
"你怎么会在这里？" 真嗣皱起眉头，惊讶于这位红发少女竟然愿意起这么早，"一大早的，你在这儿做什么？" 他打着哈欠问道。

"I…climbed over the balcony," Asuka said with a small blush due to embarrassment. The reason she came to his room was after she came to Shinji's room's balcony, she simply wanted to find something to do. Asuka didn't know what drove her here; maybe it's because today's her first day returning to school and she could have a walking mate on the way there, maybe it's because she wanted to prank the poor boy. But sometimes people didn't need reasons to do stupid things.
"我…翻阳台过来的，" 明日香略带羞涩地回答，脸上泛起一抹红晕。她来到真嗣房间的阳台后，只是想找点事情做。明日香也不清楚是什么驱使她来到这里；或许是因为今天是她重返学校的第一天，想找个同路人；或许是因为她想捉弄一下这个可怜的男孩。但有时候，人们做蠢事并不需要理由。

"WHAT?!" Shinji shouted in a whisper, his sleepiness completely gone, "it's dangerous! What if-"
什么？！" 真嗣低声惊呼，睡意全无，"那太危险了！万一——

"I get it!" Asuka cut him off, "that's why I'm doing it this early when Misato and Kaji are all sound asleep! I was just curious, okay? I am careful!"
我知道了！" 明日香打断他，"所以我才选择这么早，趁美里和加持都睡得正香的时候！我只是好奇而已，行了吧？我很小心的！

"Asuka…" Shinji started, "I might have to tell Misato about this."
明日香…" 真嗣开口道，"我可能得跟美里小姐说说这事。

"Don't. You. Dare," Asuka said in a dangerously low voice, "alright, I'll go back now. Forget what you saw or heard this morning, am I clear?"
你敢。" 明日香压低声音，带着危险的气息说，"好吧，我现在就回去。忘了你今早看到和听到的，明白了吗？

"Fine…but promise me you won't try this again," Shinji said in a stern voice. When he said that, he was simply concerned about Asuka's safety, nothing more.
"好吧…但答应我，别再这么做了。" 真嗣严肃地说。他这么说，纯粹是担心明日香的安全，别无他意。

Perhaps Asuka saw his concern, or she was surprised by his serious tone, she didn't retort or fight back, instead, she simply said, "alright. I promise. I'll go back now." She stood up and walked to the balcony.
或许是明日香察觉到了他的担忧，或是被他严肃的语气惊到了，她没有反驳也没有争执，只是简单地回应："好，我答应你。我现在就回去。" 她站起身，走向阳台。

"Asuka!" Shinji got out of the bed and followed Asuka to the balcony, ignoring the cool breeze in the morning. Irritated, he said, "you just promised!"
明日香！" 真嗣从床上跳下，跟着明日香来到阳台，不顾清晨的凉风。他有些恼火地说："你刚刚才答应过的！

"I know! I know!" Asuka sighed but flattered by how far he was willing to go to make sure she's safe, "but I need to go back unnoticed, right? I promise this is the last time! I'll be careful!" She then climbed over to the other side and smirked, "see? I told you it's nothing."
我知道！我知道！" 明日香叹了口气，但内心因他如此努力确保她的安全而感到甜蜜，"但我得悄悄回去，对吧？我保证这是最后一次！我会小心的！" 她随即翻到另一边，得意地笑了笑，"看吧？我说了没事的。

"Fine," Shinji sighed again, "well, since I'm awake now, I'll go start making breakfast. Is there anything specific you want?"
好吧，" 真嗣再次叹息，"既然我已经醒了，我去准备早餐。你有什么特别想吃的吗？

"Hm, anything you cook would be good, I just don't want instant food," Asuka replied, eliciting a small blush from Shinji, "it's my first day back to school and I don't want to be late, so quickly get to work!"
嗯，你做的什么都行，我就是不想吃速食，" 明日香回答道，让真嗣脸上泛起一丝红晕，"今天是我回学校的第一天，我不想迟到，所以快点动手吧！

"Hai." Shinji gave Asuka a last concerned look before retreating to his apartment.
"海。" 真嗣在退回自己的公寓前，给了明日香一个关切的最后一瞥。

"Hurry up Baka, or I'm leaving without you!" Asuka waited impatiently in the corridor, tapping her foot, her school bag hung over her shoulder. She didn't exactly miss school since she didn't really know anyone there, but she knew she had a lot to catch up on for the week-long suspension. Not to mention she could finally spend more time with Sh-
"快点，笨蛋，不然我就自己走了！" 明日香不耐烦地在走廊里等待，脚尖轻敲地面，书包斜挎在肩上。她并不特别怀念学校，毕竟她在那里也没什么熟人，但她知道自己因为一周的停课有很多要补上的。更不用说，她终于可以有更多时间与真——

'Since when I started missing his company? Gods I'm hopeless,' she pushed the emergency stop button of her Train of Thought.
'我是什么时候开始想念他的陪伴的？天啊，我真是没救了，' 她按下了自己思绪列车的紧急停止按钮。

"I'm coming Asuka," came Shinji's hurried voice.
"我来了，明日香。" 传来真嗣急促的声音。

The two teenagers left the bus at their usual stop. The morning was, as usual in mid-May Japan, quite cool; Shinji was wondering about the abnormally low temperature since in his memory Japan was nothing but hot all year long. He shivered and pulled up his collar as a cool breeze blew past him. Then he remembered in this new world Second Impact didn't happen, so the climate would certainly be different.
两位少年在往常的车站下了公交车。五月中旬的日本，早晨一如既往地凉爽；真嗣对这异常的低温感到疑惑，因为在他的记忆中，日本一年到头都是炎热的。一阵凉风吹过，他不禁打了个寒颤，拉高了衣领。这时他想起，在这个新世界里，第二次冲击并未发生，所以气候自然会有所不同。

Asuka, on the other hand, was totally unimpressed with the weather. In fact, she welcomed it with literal open arms – the last few days were uncomfortably hot, and she witnessed what cold weather could be like in Germany.
相比之下，明日香对这种天气完全不为所动。实际上，她张开双臂，真心欢迎这凉意——过去几天热得让人难受，而她在德国见识过寒冷天气的模样。

On the way to school the duo rarely talked to each other since none could find any topic that they shared a mutual interest. As they approached the school gate, several people raised their eyebrows at the reappearance of the redhead as well as her new company, but none made any comment, dreading the redheaded wrath.
去学校的路上，两人很少交谈，因为谁也找不到共同感兴趣的话题。当他们走近校门时，一些人看到红发少女再次出现，以及她身边的新伙伴，不禁挑起了眉毛，但没人敢发表评论，生怕触怒了那位红发少女。

"Princess! You're back!" Mari squealed delightfully as she saw Asuka and Shinji in the hallway, "oh, he is your little puppy, isn't he? Hi Mr. Shikinami!" She greeted Shinji.
"公主！你回来了！" 玛丽在走廊上看到明日香和真嗣，高兴地尖叫起来，"哦，他是你的小跟班吧，对吗？你好，式波先生！" 她向真嗣打招呼。

"M-Mr. Shikinami?" Shinji frowned, then blushed as he realized what Mari meant, "I-we aren't-"
碇君？" 真嗣皱了皱眉，随即脸红地意识到玛丽的意思，"我-我们不是——

"Sure you aren't," Mari said in a teasing tone, "but you two act and sound like one! Where were you guys last Friday and Saturday? Surely you weren't doing anything naughty!"
当然不是啦，" 玛丽用戏谑的口吻说道，"但你们俩的举止和语气就像一对！上周五和周六你们去哪儿了？肯定没做什么坏事吧！

Asuka blushed a faint blush but quickly composed herself, "we didn't do anything improper, no matter what you are implying! We were just training together for some stupid Gehirn business!"
明日香脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，但很快恢复了镇定，"我们可没做任何不妥的事，不管你在暗示什么！我们只是为了那无聊的 Gehirn 事务一起训练罢了！"

Mari laughed a little, "you're just too much fun to tease with, princess."
玛丽轻笑一声，"公主殿下，你真是太好玩了，逗你真有趣。"

Asuka narrowed her eyes and shot Mari an intense glare before entering the classroom, Shinji following closely behind. Sensei came in moments later, Hikair stood up and shouted "Rise! Bow! Sit!" as usual.
明日香眯起眼睛，狠狠地瞪了玛丽一眼，然后走进教室，紧随其后的是真嗣。不一会儿，老师也进来了，光站起来像往常一样喊道：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”

"Hello class, before we start today, I have an announcement to make," Nebukawa sensei adjusted his glasses, "the school planned a trip to Okinawa next week. Everybody without health issues is going."
“同学们好，在开始今天的课程之前，我有个通知要宣布，”尼布卡瓦老师调整了一下眼镜，“学校计划下周去冲绳旅行。所有没有健康问题的同学都要去。”

The class exploded into cheers and applauds, even Asuka seemed to be happy, "yes! I got to go scuba diving!" She turned to Shinji, "you know what this means, right Shinji?"
教室里顿时爆发出欢呼和掌声，连明日香似乎也很高兴，“太好了！我可以去潜水了！”她转向真嗣，“你知道这意味着什么吧，真嗣？”

"Wh-what does it mean?" He asked in obliviousness.
“这……这意味着什么？”他一脸茫然地问道。

Asuka facepalmed internally at his density, "it means we get to have fun!" 'With you,' a voice in her mind added, making her cheeks heat up, and an affectionate smile that appeared on Shinji's face didn't help the matter.
明日香内心对他的迟钝感到无语，"这意味着我们可以尽情玩乐！" '和你一起，' 她脑海中的声音补充道，让她脸颊发烫，而真嗣脸上浮现的温柔笑容更是让情况雪上加霜。

"Well, I've never been to a beach before, so I can't imagine what it will be like," Shinji replied with uneasiness, scratching the back of his head.
"嗯，我以前从没去过海滩，所以想象不出会是什么样子，" 真嗣不安地回答，挠了挠后脑勺。

"Hmm, I've been to some beaches back in Germany, but I was too young to have all the fun," Asuka said, eyes wandering to the roof as she recalled her mother bringing her to a beach, "and now I can finally do most of the things I want!"
嗯，我在德国去过一些海滩，但那时太小，没能尽兴，" 明日香说着，目光飘向天花板，回忆起母亲带她去海滩的情景，"现在我终于可以做我想做的绝大部分事情了！

"Like?" Shinji asked curiously.
"比如？" 真嗣好奇地问。

"Anta Baka?" Asuka huffed, "diving! Of course," she said, "and you know, beach volleyball, all that stuff."
你傻吗？"明日香哼了一声，"潜水！当然，"她说，"还有沙滩排球，所有那些活动。

"Ah," Shinji gulped at the mention of diving since he didn't know how to swim, "I'll just have fun on the beach, then."
啊，"听到潜水，真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫，因为他根本不会游泳，"那我就在沙滩上玩玩好了。

"No you are not!" Asuka raised her volume, wondering what in the world the boy she started to have feelings for was thinking about, "you're going with ME!"
不行！"明日香提高了音量，纳闷自己开始动心的这个男孩到底在想什么，"你要跟我一起去！

She failed to contain her volume and her voice drew many curious and jealous looks around the class. Asuka shot back a threatening glare, and they immediately went back to their former conversation partners.
她没能控制住自己的音量，声音引来了班上许多好奇和嫉妒的目光。明日香回以一个威胁的眼神，他们立刻回到了原来的交谈对象。

"Erm, but I, I can't-"
呃，但是，我，我不会-

"You can't swim?" Asuka interrupted in a lower volume, saving Shinji's face.
"你不会游泳？" 明日香压低声音打断他，为真嗣留了面子。

"Y-yeah," Shinji admitted with clear embarrassment.
"嗯，是的，" 真嗣承认道，明显感到尴尬。

"Phew, I thought you have Aquaphobia or something," Asuka smirked, "well, it's much easier this way. I'll teach you how to swim."
呼，我还以为你有恐水症之类的，" 明日香坏笑着说，"这样就简单多了。我来教你游泳吧。

"But-" 但-

"No buts, Third!" Asuka cut him off, "I'm feeling extremely generous today, and rejecting my offer would be rude and met with blood," she threatened.
"没有但是，第三！"明日香打断他，"我今天心情特别好，拒绝我的提议可是会惹来血光之灾的，"她威胁道。

"Al-alright then," Shinji swallowed, having no idea of what he just got himself into. Asuka could be really convincing when she sets her mind.
"那、那就好吧，"真嗣咽了口唾沫，完全不知道自己刚陷入了什么境地。明日香一旦下定决心，说服力确实惊人。

XXXXXX

"You. Me. The mall. 5 p.m.," Asuka said before entering her apartment, "objections?"
你，我，商场，下午五点，"明日香说完便走进自己的公寓，"有异议吗？

"Erm, I suppose you want me to go shopping with you? What for?" Shinji asked, confused.
"呃，我想你是想让我陪你一起去购物？买什么呢？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"Anta Baka? I need to get new swimsuits! Haven't got time to buy any since I came here," Asuka sighed at his obliviousness, "and you need swimsuits as well as some new clothes. What you have now is…discreditable," she complained, "since you're going with me, the great Asuka, you are going to dress up a little. Have some fashion! Or I'll make you," she finished with an intimidating remark.
"你傻吗？我需要买新的泳装！自从来到这里，我还没时间去买呢，" 明日香对他的迟钝叹了口气，"而且你也需要泳装和一些新衣服。你现在穿的这些……太丢人了，" 她抱怨道，"既然你要和我，伟大的明日香一起去，你得稍微打扮一下。有点时尚感！否则我会逼你这么做，" 她以一句威胁的话结束了对话。

Shinji blushed at the thought of seeing Asuka wearing a bikini, "Wha-t? I… It's so embarrassing! I'm a boy, and we are not like…together or something! You should do this with other girls! How about Mari? She seems friendly with you," Although he really wanted to go, his etiquette was preventing him from accepting the offer outright. He didn't want Asuka to regard him as a pervert, which he thought would very likely happen if he accepted her offer immediately.
想到要看到明日香穿比基尼，真嗣脸红了，"什-么？我……这太尴尬了！我是男生，我们又不是……那种关系！你应该和其他女生一起去！玛丽怎么样？她看起来和你挺亲近的，" 尽管他真的很想去，但他的礼节感让他无法直接接受邀请。他不想让明日香把他看作变态，他认为如果立刻接受她的邀请，这种可能性非常大。

"Hmph, you are so boring! Boys would kill for such an opportunity! Also, don't get wrong ideas! Be a good friend and accept my offer. You'll help me carry the bags," Asuka hastily explained, thinking if she pushed too far. She'd never get used to Japanese social etiquette.
"哼，你真没劲！这种机会男生们求之不得呢！还有，别想歪了！作为好朋友，你就接受我的提议吧。帮我拎包就行，" 明日香急忙解释道，心想如果逼得太紧，她可能永远适应不了日本的社交礼仪。

"You…think of me as a good friend?" Shinji suddenly asked after a few seconds of silence, his face showing genuine happiness and surprise.
"你…真的把我当好朋友吗？" 沉默了几秒后，真嗣突然问道，脸上流露出真挚的喜悦与惊讶。

Asuka's face went through a series of expressions: from confusion, to hurt, to angry, back to confusion, to grin, to settle once more on confusion. Finally, she let out a sigh and spoke up. "Third. You're just…impossible. You're silent and unproblematic most of the time, but when you drop a bomb…" She paused and pondered for a moment, then continued, "I'll put it in this way: I don't know why or how, but you're one of the very few people I feel comfortable around with. Is this enough for you?" In fact, she was only comfortable around the former Kaji, her deceased momma, Misato Katsuragi, and Shinji Ikari.
明日香的表情经历了一番变化：从困惑，到受伤，再到愤怒，又回到困惑，接着是咧嘴一笑，最终再次陷入迷茫。她长叹一声，开口说道："第三。你真是…让人捉摸不透。大多数时候你沉默寡言，不惹麻烦，但一旦开口…" 她停顿了一下，沉思片刻后继续说："这么说吧：我不知道为什么，也不知道怎么回事，但你确实是我少数几个感到自在的人之一。这样你满意了吗？" 实际上，她只对前男友加持、已故的母亲、葛城美里以及碇真嗣感到自在。

Shinji's smile grew wider and he nodded, "t-thanks Asuka." He felt ecstatic inside as he finally made sure he had made real progress in getting closer to the redhead whom God asked him to approach and whom he had grown fond of. "I'll go with you then."
真嗣的笑容愈发灿烂，他点头道：“谢、谢谢你，明日香。”内心狂喜，他终于确信自己在接近这位上帝嘱咐他接近、且已心生好感的红发少女方面取得了实质性进展。“那我就跟你一起去吧。”

One hour later 一小时后

Shinji had kept a dejected expression on his face along the way just like any other man would when shopping with girls. Asuka, on the other hand, was looking happy. "Hey, Baka, we are here."
真嗣一路上都保持着沮丧的表情，就像任何陪女生逛街的男生一样。而明日香则显得兴高采烈。“喂，笨蛋，我们到了。”

Shinji turned his head, just to look at a whole store of revealing swimsuits. He immediately blushed and turned around, "Err, Asuka, you can go get what you want. I…I will be waiting for you outside."
真嗣转过头，映入眼帘的是一整家店琳琅满目的性感泳装。他顿时脸红，急忙转过身去，“呃，明日香，你去挑你想要的吧。我……我在外面等你。”

Asuka pouted, "Fine, whatever." She walked into the store and wandered around. She firstly chose a pair of blue and black swim trunks as well as fashionable beach pants for Shinji; then she started picking her own swimsuits. Minutes passed and Asuka still couldn't find a satisfactory one. Then her eyes settled on a set of bikinis with white and red stripes on it. For some unspoken reason, she fell in love with it the instant she saw it. She put on the swimsuit in the changing room, came out, and called to Shinji. "Shinji! What do you think about this one?"
明日香嘟着嘴，“行吧，随你。”她走进店里，四处逛了逛。首先为真嗣挑选了一双蓝黑相间的泳裤和时尚的沙滩裤；接着开始挑选自己的泳装。时间一分分过去，明日香仍未找到满意的款式。这时，她的目光落在一套带有白红条纹的比基尼上。不知为何，她一见钟情。她在试衣间换上泳装，走出来，向真嗣喊道：“真嗣！你觉得这件怎么样？”

Shinji reluctantly turned his head around, but once he set his eyes on her, his gaze couldn't move an inch. Asuka's body was perfect in that swimsuit. His face blushed so red that would make Asuka's Unit 02 ashamed.
真嗣不情愿地转过头来，但一看到她，视线便再也无法移开。明日香的身材在那件泳装衬托下完美无瑕。他的脸红得让明日香的二号机都要自愧不如。

Asuka was clearly satisfied with his reaction. She turned away with a faint smile on her face, walking into the changing room. After a minute or so, Asuka came out wearing her blue shirt and jeans. "Shinji, let's go get some decent clothes for you!"
明日香显然对他的反应很满意。她脸上带着淡淡的微笑，转身走进试衣间。过了一分钟左右，明日香穿着蓝色衬衫和牛仔裤走了出来。“真嗣，我们去给你挑些像样的衣服吧！”

"Ah, yes Asuka," Shinji shook his head, trying to clear his perverted thoughts, "well, what do you want to get for me?"
“啊，好的，明日香，”真嗣摇摇头，试图驱散那些不雅的念头，“嗯，你想给我买什么？”

"Emmm, some stylish t-shirts, a pair of jeans…at least something different. I don't want to go out with you wearing some boring school uniform!" Asuka crossed her arms around her chest, pouting.
"嗯，来点时髦的 T 恤，一条牛仔裤……至少得有点新意。我可不想跟你出去还穿着那身无聊的校服！" 明日香双臂交叉抱在胸前，噘着嘴说道。

"As…you wish," Shinji said, following the redhead to the men's clothing section. Our favorite pair could see other students from their school in the mall, seemingly all here to prepare for the upcoming trip to Okinawa. Some of them noticed the pair – most of them ignored Shinji and Asuka and went on to their own business, some of the boys looked jealous, while other boys silently saluted to Shinji, as if saying 'good luck, pal.'
"就……依你吧，" 真嗣说着，跟在红发少女身后走向男装区。这对欢喜冤家在商场里还能看到同校的其他学生，显然大家都是为了即将到来的冲绳之旅做准备。有些人注意到了他们——大多数人对此视而不见，继续忙自己的事，有些男生则投来嫉妒的目光，而另一些男生则默默地向真嗣致意，仿佛在说"哥们，祝你好运"。

Looking down at the bags hung on his arms, Shinji sighed internally. 'I really hope it'll be worth it…'
低头看着挂在自己手臂上的购物袋，真嗣内心叹了口气。'真希望这一切都值得……'

"Bye kids! Try not to have too much fun!" Misato waved the Children goodbye as they got in Kaji's black Cadillac SUV, which carried Shinji and Asuka's baggage. The last few days went quite normally for the Children; Asuka enjoyed Shinji's cooking but not admitting it. The prophesier even came to Shinji one night and taught him a few tips dealing with Asuka after he mentioned their trip to Okinawa. For some reason unknown to Shinji, the prophesier sounded almost envious at that.
"再见啦，孩子们！别玩得太疯哦！" 孩子们登上葛城驾驶的黑色凯迪拉克 SUV，车里装着真嗣和明日香的行李，美里向他们挥手告别。最近几天，孩子们的生活相当正常；明日香虽然嘴上不承认，但很享受真嗣的厨艺。那位预言者甚至在一个晚上找到真嗣，教了他几招如何应对明日香，尤其是在提到他们即将前往冲绳的旅行时。不知为何，预言者的语气中竟流露出一丝羡慕。

"Why aren't you and Kaji-san coming?" Asuka rolled the window down, peeking out her head, "we'll have so much fun!"
你和葛城先生怎么不来呢？" 明日香摇下车窗，探出头来，"我们会玩得很开心的！

"Nah, I'll just hang out with Kaji during these days," Misato replied, "this is a school trip, I'll let you kids have fun by yourselves, alright? No Gehirn business spoiling anything for you!"
不了，这几天我就和葛城一起打发时间，" 美里回答道，"这是学校的旅行，让你们小孩子自己去享受吧，好吗？不会有 NERV 的公务来打扰你们的！

"Hmph, a few days ago you were on his throat all the time! What changed?" said Asuka with a smirk, "I bet you aren't coming so that you two can have the apartment all by yourselves! Ewwww! You adults are so indecent!"
哼，前几天你还老是对他大呼小叫的！怎么突然变了？" 明日香带着一丝坏笑说，"我猜你不去，是为了你们俩能独占整个公寓吧！咦——！你们大人真是不检点！

Misato's face flushed, "IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT! It's just we live near, and it's convenient, that's all! And we are NOT doing anything indecent, no matter what you're imagining!"
美里脸颊泛红，急忙辩解：“根本不是你想的那样！只是我们住得近，比较方便而已！而且我们绝对没有做任何不雅的事，不管你在想什么都别乱猜！”

Asuka snorted, not believing a single character in her speech, "sure, sure. Anyways, have fun with your dear Kaji-san. He's really worth it."
明日香嗤之以鼻，对她的说辞一个字也不信，“行吧，行吧。总之，和你亲爱的加持先生好好享受吧。他确实挺值得的。”

Kaji, on the driver's seat, and Misato both blinked in surprise. 'Is she really the girl I met last last week? Hmm, I guess people do change.' He thought with an internal smile while Misato said, "who are you and what did you do to the real Asuka?"
坐在驾驶座的加持和美里都惊讶地眨了眨眼。‘这真的是我上周见过的那个女孩吗？嗯，看来人确实会变。’他内心微笑着思索，而美里则问道：“你是谁？你把真正的明日香怎么了？”

"I killed her, grounded her, and replaced her with myself, a perfect doppelgänger", she hissed as inhumanly as she could, "what, have any problems with that?"
“我把她杀了，埋了，然后自己取而代之，一个完美的替身，”她尽可能地装出非人的声音嘶嘶地说，“怎么，对此有意见吗？”

"Not at all Asuka." Misato chuckled, "It's just good to see you're getting back to normal."
一点也不像明日香哦。" 美里笑着说，"看到你恢复正常真是太好了。

"What's that supposed to mean?!" Asuka snapped, upper body sticking out the window, "are you saying that there was something wrong with me?!"
你这话什么意思?!" 明日香怒气冲冲地探出上半身，从车窗里喊道，"你是说我之前有什么不对劲吗?!

"No, no, no!" Misato quickly raised her hands up to her defense as if to shield herself from Asuka's barrage. "I didn't mean it like that!"
不不不！" 美里急忙举起双手，仿佛要挡住明日香的连珠炮似的，"我不是那个意思！

"Oh you didn't, did you?" The redhead growled, throwing a crumpled paper ball at her guardian, "Then what did you mean by that?"
哦，你不是那个意思，是吗?" 红发少女咆哮着，向她的监护人扔了一个皱巴巴的纸团，"那你到底是什么意思?

"Just drop it, alright?!" Misato sighed, "you guys better get going! You don't wanna miss the plane, do you?"
就别提了，行不行？" 葛城美里叹了口气，"你们最好快点出发！不想错过飞机吧？

A quick glance at the clock validated Misato's concern. "Hmph, there will be hell to pay when I come back, Misato!" She patted the driver's seat, "let's go Kaji!"
匆匆瞥了一眼时钟，证实了葛城美里的担忧。"哼，等我回来有你好看的，葛城！" 她拍了拍驾驶座，"走吧，加持！"

"Hai, Hai, my highness," Kaji stepped on the acceleration pedal and the SUV sped down the street, its direction to Tokyo-3 International Airport.
"遵命，公主殿下，" 加持踩下油门，SUV 疾驰在通往第三新东京国际机场的街道上。

One hour later 一小时后

"Here's your boarding pass, sir, have a nice trip." The smiling check-in staff handed Shinji his ticket along with his Gehirn ID card, raising an eyebrow when she first saw it but made no comments. Shinji thanked her and grabbed his stuff before heading to the exit. Asuka was there waiting for him. "Hey Baka," she greeted as she saw him approaching, "where's your seat?"
这是您的登机牌，先生，祝您旅途愉快。" 面带微笑的值机员递给真嗣机票和他的 Gehirn 身份证，初见时挑了挑眉，但并未多言。真嗣道谢后抓起行李，朝出口走去。明日香已经在那里等他了。"嘿，笨蛋，" 她看到他走近时打招呼，"你的座位在哪儿？

"Hm, let me check," Shinji took out his boarding pass and read it, "it says 36-B. what's yours?" He asked with anticipation.
"嗯，我看看，" 真嗣掏出登机牌查看，"上面写着 36-B。你的呢？" 他满怀期待地问道。

Asuka's mood lowered hearing his words, "too bad. I got 31-C, I was hoping to sit with you," she blushed a little after she realized what she just blurted out without too much thinking, "don't think too much about it! I just don't want to be squeezed by people I don't know, that's all!" She pondered for a moment, "well Baka, send a message for me in our class's group chat!" One thing that the Children liked about the new world was smartphones as well as instant message applications.
听到他的话，明日香的兴致低落了些，"真可惜。我的是 31-C，本想和你坐一起的，" 意识到自己未经深思便脱口而出后，她略显羞涩，"别想多了！我只是不想被不认识的人挤着，仅此而已！" 她思索片刻，"喂，笨蛋，帮我在我们班的群里发个消息！" 孩子们喜欢这个新世界的一点就是智能手机和即时消息应用。

"Erm, why won't you do it by yourself? I mean, you've got your smartphone at hand, right?" Shinji asked, confused.
"呃，你自己为什么不发呢？你手里不是拿着手机吗？" 真嗣困惑地问。

"Just do it! I'll explain later," Asuka said forcefully.
"让你发就发！回头再解释，" 明日香语气强硬地说。

Shinji sighed in defeat and took out his Samsung, "what do you want to say?"
真嗣无奈地叹了口气，掏出他的三星手机，“你想说什么？”

"'Who sits at 31-B and 31-D'," said Asuka.
“'谁坐在 31-B 和 31-D'，”明日香说道。

"Alright," Shinji's confusion only grew more hearing her request. There were already several people asking about seat arrangements in the group chat, so Shinji thought at least his question wouldn't look odd. He typed the words and sent them the group chat.
“好吧，”听到她的请求，真嗣的困惑愈发加深。群里已经有好几个人在询问座位安排了，所以真嗣觉得至少他的问题不会显得突兀。他输入了这些字，然后发到了群里。

Few seconds later people responded.
几秒钟后，人们开始回复。

Takumi: I sit at 31-B
拓海：我坐在 31-B

Otaga: I'm at 31-D 太田：我在 31-D

Asuka felt nauseous seeing the names. The Takumi guy once tried to grope her in the hallway when no one's watching – although it costed him a trip to the local hospital it didn't sooth Asuka's anger and disgust by a bit. What's worse, that guy was supposed to be the hot catch for almost all girls in the school since he was moderately handsome and played good basketball – so Asuka's attitude towards him had started another round of rumors, such as 'the redhead is into her own sex' or 'the Shikinamis are indeed married.' Takumi's charms had brought him endless fan-girls and backup girlfriends. However, Asuka saw right through him – he's just some perverted womanizer, nothing more.
明日香看到这些名字感到恶心。那个叫拓海的家伙曾在没人注意的走廊里试图对她动手动脚——虽然这让他去了趟当地医院，但丝毫没有平息明日香的愤怒和厌恶。更糟糕的是，那家伙本该是学校里几乎所有女生的梦中情人，因为他长得还算帅气，篮球也打得好——所以明日香对他的态度又引发了一轮谣言，比如“红发女郎喜欢同性”或“志那都家确实结婚了”。拓海的魅力为他带来了无数的迷妹和备胎女友。然而，明日香一眼就看穿了他——不过是个好色的花花公子，仅此而已。

'How fucking unlucky,' she thought bitterly, 'there's NO WAY I'm sitting beside that piece of shit. Wait, actually, I can utilize his reputation to help me get out of this…'
她苦涩地想，“真是倒霉透顶，我绝不可能坐在那个混蛋旁边。等等，其实我可以利用他的名声帮我摆脱这个困境……”

"Ask who sits around you, Shinji," Asuka, determined to avoid encountering Takumi by any means – not that she dreaded the challenge, she was simply disgusted by that person – formed a plan in her head.
"问问你旁边坐的是谁，真嗣。" 明日香决心不惜一切避免与琢磨相遇——并非她害怕挑战，只是单纯厌恶那个人——她在脑海中构思了一个计划。

"Okay," Shinji typed and sent the message.
"好的，" 真嗣打字并发送了消息。

To Asuka's relief a girl would be sitting next to Shinji. She remembered her name and tried to send her a PM using her own smartphone: 'Hello, Akari-san-'
令明日香松了一口气的是，坐在真嗣旁边的将是一个女孩。她记起了她的名字，并试图用自己的智能手机给她发送私信：'你好，茜小姐-'

She stopped typing since she forgot how to type the next word. She hadn't learned all the kanji yet. Asuka groaned in frustration – it was one of the reasons why she asked Shinji to send the message for her. The other reason was she didn't want people to know where she sits – and that had proven to be the right choice.
她停下了打字，因为她忘记了下一个词怎么打。她还没有学会所有的汉字。明日香懊恼地叹了口气——这也是她让真嗣帮她发消息的原因之一。另一个原因是她不想让别人知道她坐在哪里——而这一决定已被证明是正确的选择。

"Shinji, type a message for me," seeing no other way to do this, Asuka reluctantly turned to Shinji for help.
"真嗣，帮我发条消息，" 实在没办法，明日香不情愿地转向真嗣求助。

"Um, yes?" 呃，好的？

Asuka handed him her phone, "alright, 'Akari-san, can we exchange seats?'"
明日香递给他自己的手机，"好了，'茜小姐，我们能换下座位吗？'"

Shinji gave her a puzzled look, "Akari-san? Doesn't she sit next to me?" He put two and two together and blushed a faint blush, "wait…you want to sit with me?"
真嗣困惑地看了她一眼，"茜小姐？她不是坐我旁边吗？" 他恍然大悟，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，"等等…你想和我坐一起？"

Asuka blushed a little as well – this was another reason why she was reluctant to ask Shinji for help – the main reason was she didn't want Shinji to know she couldn't type kanji, and that would mean showing her weakness. "Listen, don't think too much about it! It's just you are the least painful company among all others!" She paused for a moment as a dreaded realization dawned on her, "unless…you don't want to sit with me?" She asked just above a whisper.
明日香也微微脸红——这也是她不愿向真嗣求助的另一个原因——主要是因为她不想让真嗣知道她不会打汉字，这意味着要暴露自己的弱点。“听着，别想太多了！只是你比其他人更不让人讨厌而已！”她停顿了一下，一个可怕的念头突然涌上心头，“除非……你不想和我坐在一起？”她低声问道。

"Wh-what? Of course not, I mean – yes, no, I mean-" Shinji stammered incoherent words, to which Asuka chuckled, "I'll take that as 'no, of course I don't not want to sit with you,' and 'yes, I will sit next to you.'"
“什、什么？当然不是，我是说——是的，不，我是说——”真嗣结结巴巴地说着含糊不清的话，对此明日香轻笑道，“我就当你是‘不，我当然不想不和你坐在一起’，还有‘是的，我会坐在你旁边’。”

Shinji smiled, surprised at how far Asuka was willing to go to spend time with him. "Al-alright, I'll send the message."
真嗣微笑着，惊讶于明日香为了和他共度时光愿意做到这种程度。“那、那好吧，我来发消息。”

A minute later he got a reply: 'Hello Shikinami-san, where do you sit?'
一分钟后他收到了回复：'你好，式波小姐，你坐在哪里？'

'I sit next to Takumi' Shinji replied as instructed by Asuka.
'我坐在高木旁边。' 真嗣按照明日香的指示回答道。

To her satisfaction, the girl immediately replied: 'Oh that's great! I'd love to exchange my seat with you!'
令她满意的是，女孩立刻回应：'哦，那太好了！我很愿意和你交换座位！'

Asuka couldn't help but grin widely, 'Heh, girls…you are hopeless,' she thought with amusement.
明日香忍不住咧嘴一笑，'呵，女生们……真是没救了，' 她带着几分戏谑想道。

The duo boarded the Japan Air Boeing 737 and sat on their seats. Asuka was a little unsatisfied since she didn't get to sit the window seat, "It's boring sitting next to the aisle," she complained. Nevertheless, she was more than happy to sit next to Shinji – at least she had someone she was comfortable interacting with.
两人登上日本航空的波音 737，坐到了自己的座位上。明日香有些不满，因为她没能坐到靠窗的位置，"坐在过道旁边真无聊，"她抱怨道。不过，能坐在真嗣旁边，她还是颇为高兴的——至少她有了一位相处起来自在的邻座。

The plane took off with the engines roaring – the moisture in the air created mesmerizing contrails that dragged behind the wingtips. The whole flight would take about 3 hours, and in the meantime, Asuka just chatted random stuff with the boy sitting next to her. One hour later they both drained the pool of conversation topics, and Shinji took out manga to read while Asuka played her console. Another half an hour or so later, after the sixth death on a particular mission, Asuka finally reached her limit of patience.
飞机伴随着引擎的轰鸣声起飞了——空气中的湿气形成了迷人的凝结尾迹，拖曳在翼尖之后。整个飞行大约需要 3 个小时，在此期间，明日香只是和坐在她旁边的男孩闲聊。一个小时后，他们俩把能聊的话题都聊尽了，于是真嗣拿出漫画来读，而明日香则玩起了她的游戏机。又过了大约半个小时，在某个任务中死了第六次后，明日香终于忍无可忍。

"Hey Baka," she patted the boy beside her, who put the mange he was reading and looked at her, "yes Asuka?" He spoke.
"喂，笨蛋，"她拍了拍旁边的男孩，他放下手中的漫画，看向她，"什么事，明日香？"他问道。

"I'm bored." 我无聊死了。

XXXXXX

It turned out that nothing good would ever take place when Asuka got bored. Shinji spent the rest of the flight giving her a lesson in advanced kanji – he also promised to give her more lessons later. "Consider it payback for my offer to teach you to swim," she said, not admitting the truth was that she needed help.
事实证明，每当明日香感到无聊时，总不会有好事发生。真嗣在余下的飞行时间里给她上了一堂高级汉字课——他还承诺以后会给她更多的课程。"就当是回报我之前教你游泳的提议吧，"她说道，并没有承认真正的原因是她需要帮助。

The hotel desk clerk raised an eyebrow as she saw Shinji and Asuka's ID; moments later, she handed the children two keycards with '312' written on both of them. "Wait, WHAT THE HELL?" Asuka cried as the realization dawned on her, "HOW AM I LIVING IN THE SAME ROOM AS HIM?!"
酒店前台接待员看到真嗣和明日香的身份证时挑了挑眉；片刻后，她递给两个孩子两张写有“312”的房卡。“等等，这算什么鬼？”明日香恍然大悟地喊道，“我怎么可能和他住同一间房？！”

The clerk frowned, "well, considering you are married-"
接待员皱起眉头，“呃，考虑到你们是已婚——”

"WE'RE NOT MARRIED!" Asuka's roof-breaking volume attracted the female sensei's attention, and she walked over to check the situation. At the same time, Shinji wanted nothing more than to dig a hole in the ground and vanish. "What's wrong?"
“我们没结婚！”明日香震耳欲聋的音量吸引了女老师的注意，她走过来查看情况。与此同时，真嗣只想在地上挖个洞钻进去消失。“怎么了？”

"WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE SAME ROOM!" Asuka shouted, showing the keycards to the teacher. Although she was okay living with Shinji during their training session, and she trusted him to not do anything perverted – he passed the test, after all - it was still inappropriate for them to publicly live together, much less in a hotel. The rumors were never going to stop if her classmates knew it.
“我们不住同一间房！”明日香喊着，向老师展示了房卡。虽然她在训练期间与真嗣同住没问题，也相信他不会做出什么下流的事——他毕竟通过了考验——但公开在酒店同住还是不妥，更别提如果被同学知道了，流言蜚语将永无止境。

Hanako-sensei chuckled nervously, "right, we don't allow boys and girls to live on the same floor," she explained to the clerk, "so assign different rooms for them. Please."
花子老师紧张地笑了笑，“对，我们不允许男生和女生住在同一层，”她向职员解释道，“所以请给他们安排不同的房间。麻烦了。”

The clerk looked like wanting to say something but wisely shut up as Asuka shot her a threatening glare. Minutes later she started, "there's only a double room with a king-sized bed left, room 412, directly above 312," she said, "so you two have to pay for the fee of both double rooms."
职员似乎想说些什么，但明智地闭上了嘴，因为明日香向她投去了一个威胁的眼神。几分钟后她开口道：“只剩下一个带特大号床的双人房，412 号房，就在 312 号房正上方，”她说，“所以你们俩得支付两个双人房的费用。”

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other, then shrugged. Gehirn's salary for them was more than enough for them to not care about things as trivial as this one. They paid the money and picked up the luggage before heading to the elevator.
真嗣和明日香对视一眼，然后耸了耸肩。Gehirn 给他们的薪水足以让他们对这种琐事不以为意。他们付了钱，拿起行李，便朝电梯走去。

They greeted each other goodnight before Asuka exited the elevator on the third floor where all the girls lived. Janitors were assigned to make sure no one would sneak out of their rooms during the nights. Both Shinji and Asuka stared at the unfamiliar ceiling in remote-synchronization before drifting into sleep.
他们在电梯里互道晚安，随后明日香在三楼——女生居住的楼层——下了电梯。夜里有专门的保洁人员确保没人会偷偷溜出房间。真嗣和明日香在遥远的同步中凝视着陌生的天花板，渐渐进入了梦乡。

'Don't let her see you staring…' That was all Shinji could think about Asuka's choice of swimwear. The red bikini with a tie-dye cover-up, and it took every ounce of willpower to keep his focus on her eyes. Not that other boys on the beach were doing better than him. Mari's didn't seem any better – she loved showing off her assets to boys.
'别让她看到你在盯着……'这是真嗣对明日香选择的泳装所能想到的全部。那件红色比基尼搭配扎染罩衫，他费尽全力才让自己的目光集中在她的眼睛上。并非海滩上的其他男孩表现得比他好。真希波的似乎也没好到哪去——她喜欢向男孩们展示自己的魅力。

Much to Asuka's satisfaction, Shinji seemed to focus on her exclusively – she would be offended if she caught him staring at any girls other than her. Asuka couldn't help but frown at her thoughts. Since when she started craving Shinji's attention so much? And why would she feel her stomach knots, thinking about him looking at other girls?
让明日香颇为满意的是，真嗣似乎只专注于她——如果她发现他盯着其他女孩，她会感到被冒犯。明日香不禁皱起眉头，思绪纷乱。她是从何时开始如此渴望真嗣的关注？又为何一想到他看向其他女孩，她的胃就纠结成一团？

"So Shinji, when are your two stooges supposed to show up?" Asuka asked with a grin.
"那么真嗣，你那两个跟班什么时候来？"明日香带着一丝坏笑问道。

"Oh, I'm pretty sure they'll be here later, I told them to show up around eleven," Shinji replied, eliciting a raised eyebrow from Asuka, "What? Why so late? I thought you want to spend time with your so-called friends," she said in an unreadable tone.
"哦，我确信他们晚些时候会到，我告诉他们大约十一点来，"真嗣回答道，引得明日香挑起了一边的眉毛，"什么？为什么这么晚？我还以为你想和你的所谓朋友们共度时光呢，"她用一种难以捉摸的语气说道。

Shinji gulped as he thought he might be stepping into a minefield, so he decided to speak his heart, "well… It's not that you're taking my time against my will, or anything", Shinji objected. "And I prefer…y-your company to theirs, to be honest. Not that they're…bad, or anything."
真嗣咽了口唾沫，感觉自己可能正踏入雷区，于是决定坦露心声，“嗯……并不是你强行占用我的时间，或者别的什么，”真嗣反驳道，“而且我更愿意……说实话，比起他们，我更喜欢你的陪伴。并不是说他们……不好，或者怎样。”

"I suppose you have good taste," Asuka said with a smile in the corner of her mouth, "Anyways, wanna swim now? I said I'll teach you, and you promised to learn!"
“看来你品味不错嘛，”明日香嘴角勾起一丝笑意，“不管怎样，现在想游泳吗？我说过要教你，你也答应了要学！”

"Sure, just… don't push me so hard," Shinji smiled an uneasy smile.
“当然，只是……别逼我太紧，”真嗣挤出一个不安的微笑。

"It's no problem, I'll control my pace!" Asuka smiled, "Now, just get your asses moving! We can't go scuba diving if you don't know how to swim!"
“没问题，我会控制好节奏的！”明日香笑着说，“现在，赶紧动起来！如果你们连游泳都不会，还怎么去潜水呢！”

Shinji quickly got up from the baking sand and grabbed his swimwear. After few minutes, he came back to the beach, and Asuka was already in the sea, waiting for him.
真嗣迅速从炙热的沙滩上爬起，抓起泳装。几分钟后，他回到海滩，而明日香已经在海中，等着他了。

"Now, Shinji, tell me how much you know about swimming?"
那么，真嗣，告诉我你对游泳了解多少？

"Well, I don't really know much other than lying in the water floating."
嗯，除了躺在水里漂浮，我其实不太懂。

"It's good for an untrained boy like you to have an athletic me nearby, don't you think? Now get down here, lie in the water, face up. I don't want seawater damaging your eyes! Don't worry! I will support you!"
像你这样未经训练的男孩，有我这样运动型的在旁边，不是挺好的吗？快下来，躺在水里，脸朝上。我不想海水伤到你的眼睛！别担心！我会支撑你的！

Shinji sighed and walked into the sea until the water reached his waist. Seeing how reluctant he was, Asuka grabbed his wrist and dragged him into the water.
真嗣叹了口气，走进海中，直到水没过腰际。见他如此不情愿，明日香抓住他的手腕，将他拖入水中。

Shinji's whole body shivered at the sudden contact with cold water but soon adjusted. He felt relieved as his feet touched the sand.
突然接触冷水让真嗣全身一颤，但很快便适应了。当脚底触及沙地时，他感到一阵释然。

"Now, get your feet off the ground! Which part of 'lying in the water facing up' you don't understand?" Asuka raised her volume, putting her right hand at Shinji's abdomen, her left hand at his chest, lifting Shinji up. The buoyance of water offset a major part of his weight so that Asuka could support him with ease.
“现在，把脚抬起来！‘仰面躺在水里’是哪部分你听不懂？”明日香提高了音量，右手放在真嗣腹部，左手置于他胸前，将他抬起。水的浮力抵消了他大部分体重，使得明日香能轻松支撑住他。

Shinji, on the other hand, was promptly starting to feel uncomfortable in his pants, as his hormones started raging under the sensation of Asuka's smooth hands pressing against his body. He quickly calmed down by visualizing a naked Commander Ikari. The side effect, though, was he felt he wanted to puke.
与此同时，真嗣感到裤子里开始不舒服，因为明日香光滑的手触碰他身体的感觉让他的荷尔蒙开始激荡。他迅速通过想象赤裸的碇司令来平复情绪。然而，副作用是他感到一阵恶心想吐。

Just as he wondered in his own thought-world, Asuka retreated her hands slowly, trying not to make Shinji notice. And he did not. Asuka was happy that Shinji could still keep floating on himself. That's a good start.
正当他在自己的思绪世界中徘徊时，明日香缓缓地缩回了双手，尽量不让真嗣察觉。而他确实没有注意到。明日香为真嗣仍能保持自我漂浮而感到高兴。这是个好的开始。

The first day on the beach was fun, to say the least. Shinji had made enormous progress during the day's training session given by the coach Asuka – much to both of their surprise. Shinji could already swim for one hundred meters in water without the need to rest. Of course, none of them knew it was his muscle memory inherited from the former Shinji.
海滩上的第一天，至少可以说是非常有趣的。在明日香教练的指导下，真嗣在当天的训练中取得了巨大的进步。这让他们俩都感到惊讶。真嗣已经能够在水中游一百米而不需要休息。当然，他们都不知道这是来自前一个真嗣的肌肉记忆。

However, apparently the God of Weather wasn't in a good mood in the late afternoon. The storm came unexpectedly, and the temperature dropped off a cliff.
然而，显然天气之神在傍晚时分心情不佳。暴风雨突如其来，气温骤降。

Asuka laid in her bed, having woken up from a nightmare about her mother half an hour ago, unable to sleep due to the chilling temperature. What's worse, the air-conditioning in her room wasn't working – that she would file a customer complaint tomorrow. She tossed and turned in the bed for hours, tightly wrapped in the thin sheet she was provided. The huge French windows did little to help to contain the precious warmth from slipping away, if not accelerating it.
明日香躺在床上，半小时前从关于母亲的噩梦中惊醒，由于寒冷的气温而无法入睡。更糟糕的是，她房间的空调坏了——她打算明天就提出投诉。她在床上辗转反侧了几个小时，紧紧裹着提供的薄被单。巨大的法式窗户几乎没有帮助，珍贵的温暖不仅没有被留住，反而加速流失。

She balled her fists and glanced at the clock again. 23:48. 'Fuck no. I don't need to freeze myself to death right now…and I don't need another nightmare.' She took a long breath, held it, and released it slowly, her hand pressed against her stomach. The tensed muscles relaxed just a bit. Repeating the process helped – but not enough to let her fall asleep. There was an insidious, treacherous voice whispering in her head: 'Go to him. He would not mind…What do you have to lose? You don't need to be alone.'
她握紧拳头，再次瞥了一眼时钟。23:48。“该死，我现在不需要冻死自己……也不需要另一个噩梦。”她深吸一口气，屏住呼吸，然后缓缓呼出，手按在腹部。紧绷的肌肉稍微放松了一些。重复这个过程有所帮助——但不足以让她入睡。一个阴险、狡猾的声音在她脑海中低语：“去找他。他不会介意的……你有什么可失去的？你不需要孤单一人。”

'I have my standards!' Asuka tried to squash the voice, 'he'll think too much about it!'
“我有我的标准！”明日香试图压制那个声音，“他会想太多的！”

'No, he would never. He cares about you. Have you already forgotten how he acted when you dropped down on his bed during the last night of your sync training? He has restraints. No one could ever resist something like that – the last person was Kaji.' The voice insisted.
“不，他绝不会。他关心你。你已经忘记了吗，上次同步训练最后一晚你倒在他床上时他的反应？他有自制力。没有人能抗拒那种事——上一个做不到的人是加持。”那个声音坚持道。

'Fuck that', Asuka hit the mattress with her fist. 'Fuck it all. If he…oversteps the boundaries, I'll just straight murder him. I'm not stupid, I'm not going to die of thirst on a bank of a river.'
“去他的，”明日香一拳砸在床垫上。“全都去他的。如果他……越界了，我就直接宰了他。我不傻，我不会在河岸上渴死。”

Asuka sprang out of bed and put on some thick clothes. A glance at the thermometer confirmed her suspicions – 9 Celsius degrees, caused by the combined effect of the storm and the lack of sunlight. She carefully opened the door the corridor –
明日香从床上跳起来，迅速穿上厚衣服。瞥了一眼温度计，证实了她的猜想——9 摄氏度，这是暴风雨和缺乏阳光共同作用的结果。她小心翼翼地打开通往走廊的门——

"Where are you going so late?" A voice came to her, freezing her on the spot, "go back to your room before I report you to the teachers!"
这么晚了你去哪儿？"一个声音传来，让她顿时僵住，"快回你房间，不然我报告老师了！

Asuka sighed and closed the door behind her. 'What now?' She thought. She walked over to French windows and opened the door to the balcony. Asuka stepped out and leaned on the railings, staring at the cloud-covered sky.
明日香叹了口气，关上身后的门。'现在怎么办？'她想着。她走向法式落地窗，打开通往阳台的门。明日香走出去，倚在栏杆上，凝视着云层密布的天空。

Suddenly something mounted on the wall beside her caught her attention.
突然，她注意到墙边安装的某个东西吸引了她的注意。

The maintenance ladders. 维修梯。

The iron ladders were nothing more than some rusty steel rods loosely installed on the wall, presumably for fixing the ventilation system. Looking up she found the ladders could lead to the balcony above hers – the balcony of Shinji's room.
那些铁梯不过是几根松散安装在墙上的锈蚀钢条，大概是用来维修通风系统的。她抬头一看，发现这些梯子能通到她楼上的阳台——也就是真嗣房间的阳台。

"Fuck", she whispered, "Fuck, fuck, fuck", she hit the railings with her fist. A great battle was raging inside her. On one side, there were: her body, shivering in the cold air, eager to be held; part of her mind, fearful of nightmares; another part of her mind, saying that Shinji would do nothing wrong; her loneliness, whispering about the simple pleasure of having Shinji close by.
“该死，”她低声咒骂，“该死，该死，该死，”她用拳头捶打着栏杆。内心正掀起一场激烈的斗争。一方面，有她的身体，在寒风中瑟瑟发抖，渴望被拥抱；一部分心灵，害怕噩梦的侵袭；另一部分心灵，坚信真嗣不会做出格的事；还有她的孤独，低语着真嗣在身边带来的简单快乐。

On the other, outnumbered and slowly giving up their grounds, were: yet another part of her mind, telling her it would be dangerous to climb the old and rusty ladders; her pride, unwilling to let her appear needy.
另一方面，寡不敌众、节节败退的则是：又一部分心灵，警告她攀爬那些老旧生锈的梯子很危险；她的自尊，不愿让她显得有所求。

Somewhere, scattered across the battlefield were notions crashed by the previous assaults: notion of propriety telling her a girl should not share a bed with a boy at this age, beaten by the simple retort that they already did and he didn't do anything wrong; her fear of Janitors or other students catching them, defeated soundly by her confidence of getting back to her room before sunrise; her worry about him getting too bold, murdered by a mix of trust and shameful desire that she might not really object if he tried.
战场上散落着被先前攻击击溃的观念：礼教观念告诉她，这个年纪的女孩不应该与男孩同床共枕，却被他们早已共眠且他并无过错的事实简单反驳；她害怕被管理员或其他学生发现，却被她坚信能在黎明前返回房间的自信彻底击败；她担心他变得过于大胆，却被信任与羞耻的欲望混合杀死，如果他尝试，她或许并不真正反对。

Another cold gust of wind blew past her, sending another shiver to her body. Asuka clenched her teeth – her stomach growled as she used too many calories to maintain her body temperature. 'I go to him, or freeze and starve to death,' although it was a farfetched exaggeration, she needed it to make up her mind.
又一阵寒风掠过，让她再次打了个寒颤。明日香紧咬牙关——为了维持体温，她消耗了太多热量，肚子开始咕咕作响。“我去找他，否则就会冻死饿死，”虽然这夸张得有些离谱，但她需要这样的理由来下定决心。

Without hesitating for another second, Asuka grabbed the ladder, lifting herself off the balcony.
明日香没有再犹豫一秒，抓住梯子，从阳台上纵身跃下。

"Hello again, Shinji," the cloaked prophesier appeared in the void, "have you had a good day with Asuka?"
“又见面了，真嗣，”那位身披斗篷的预言者在虚空中显现，“你和明日香今天过得愉快吗？”

"Um, you could say that, yeah," Shinji replied with a smile, "I mean, I had fun with her, and she seemed happy, too."
嗯，可以这么说，是的，" 真嗣微笑着回答，"我的意思是，和她在一起我很开心，她看起来也很高兴。

"Good," although the prophesier could see what happened by his own eyes, he still wanted to know how Shinji himself felt about it, "do you have any questions?"
好，" 尽管预言者亲眼看到了发生的事情，他还是想知道真嗣自己对此有何感受，"你有什么问题吗？

"Um, not now, not really," Shinji replied after pondering for a moment, "thanks for your guidance, by the way. I really wouldn't have come so far if it wasn't you."
嗯，现在没有，真的没有，" 真嗣沉思片刻后回答，"顺便感谢你的指导。如果不是你，我肯定走不到今天这一步。

The prophesier chuckled, "no need. Helping you is helping me as well, in some way," he exercised the technically true maneuver, "alright, if you don't have any questions – I'll leave you by yourself tonight. Have a good dr-wait what the hell is she doing?"
预言者轻笑一声，"不用谢。帮助你某种程度上也是在帮助我自己，" 他运用了这句技术上真实的话术，"好吧，如果你没有问题的话——今晚我就让你一个人待着。祝你有个好梦——等等，她到底在搞什么鬼？"

Shinji frowned, "Wha-" 真嗣皱起了眉头，“什——”

"OH MY GOD SHINJI WAKE UP!" The prophesier suddenly shouted, his voice almost desperate.
“天哪，真嗣，快醒醒！”预言者突然大喊，声音近乎绝望。

"What's going on?" Shinji asked, bewildered.
“发生了什么事？”真嗣困惑地问道。

"WAKE UP AND HELP HER OR SHE'S GONNA DIE!"
“快醒醒，去帮她，否则她就要死了！”

The prophesier's last word was like a starting pistol. Shinji shot open his eyes and bolted upright, his heart pounding. 'Asuka's gonna die?! Wtf does that even-'
预言者的最后一句话如同发令枪响。真嗣猛地睁开眼睛，一跃而起，心脏狂跳。“明日香要死了？！这到底是什么鬼——”

His thoughts were interrupted by a series of groans and gasps – definitively female voices – Asuka – from the balcony. Shinji dashed to the balcony, threw the door open, and rushed outside. Hastily looking in the direction of the voice, he found the girl in his dreams, the redhead he might've been falling in love with, the loud and noisy ball of fire who pushed him like no one else – was hanging on a piece of a broken metal rod with one hand for dear life.
他的思绪被一连串的呻吟和喘息声打断——明显是女性的声音——是明日香——来自阳台。真嗣冲向阳台，猛地推开门，冲了出去。急切地朝声音的方向望去，他发现梦中的女孩，那个他或许正逐渐爱上的红发少女，那个如烈火般喧嚣、无人能及地推动他的存在——正用一只手紧紧抓着一根断裂的金属杆，命悬一线。

"ASUKA!" Shinji cried and dashed forward, stretching out his hand to the girl. Asuka looked up, "Shinji!" She said with surprise and relief, "help me!"
“明日香！”真嗣大喊着冲上前去，伸出手想要抓住女孩。明日香抬头望去，“真嗣！”她带着惊讶和释然说道，“救我！”

A part of Shinji was very confused by the situation Asuka was in – how in the world did she end up like this? He shook it off since he had a much more pressing matter at hand. He tried his best to lean out as much as possible, but Asuka was too far down to reach him.
真嗣内心的一部分对明日香所处的境地感到极度困惑——她究竟是怎么落到这步田地的？但他甩开这些念头，因为眼前有更紧迫的事情。他尽力向前倾身，但明日香离他太远，无法触及。

And her hands were slipping away from her last life-saving straw.
而她的双手正从最后的救命稻草上滑落。

Without too much thinking, Shinji climbed over the railings, his right hand gripping tightly on the edge of the balcony, his other hand reaching down to Asuka.
没有过多思考，真嗣翻过栏杆，右手紧抓着阳台边缘，左手向下伸向明日香。

"What do you think you're doing, idiot?!" Asuka questioned his intelligence, yet tears were threatening to come out from the corner of her eyes, "you can't pull both of us up!"
你这个笨蛋，想干什么啊?!" 明日香质疑着他的智商，然而泪水已在她眼角打转，"你拉不上我们两个人的！

"Sorry! No time to think!" Shinji stretched down again, getting a strong grip of Asuka's wrist this time, just before the tortured metal broke and fell down.
"对不起！没时间想了！" 真嗣再次探身下去，这次紧紧抓住了明日香的手腕，就在那折磨已久的金属断裂坠落之前。

Shinji tried to pull himself and Asuka up – and predictably failed. In fact, he wasn't even able to stay hanging on the edge of the balcony much longer.
真嗣试图拉起自己和明日香——不出所料地失败了。事实上，他甚至无法在阳台边缘坚持更久。

"Drop me, Shinji, or we're both gonna fall!" Asuka said with a shaking voice, tears already freely rolling down her face. "It's only the fourth floor; two broken legs are at worst! If we both fall you may actually crush me to death!"
放手吧，真嗣，不然我们俩都会掉下去的！" 明日香颤抖着声音说道，泪水已经不受控制地滚落下来。"这只是四楼而已；顶多摔断两条腿！如果我们俩都掉下去，你可能会真的把我压死！

"I…will…not let you go!" Shinji said in a voice so low that could freeze Mt. Asama –
"我…绝…不会放手！" 真嗣的声音低沉得仿佛能冻结浅间山——

"Idiot! You don't have D-Type equipment! How are you gonna get out?" Asuka asked with a mix of anger and worry.
"笨蛋！你没有 D 型装备！你怎么逃出去？" 明日香带着愤怒与担忧问道。

"Hadn't thought that far. But If the battery runs out, the muscle will still lock on." Shinji said, his voice indifferent.
"还没想那么远。但如果电池耗尽，肌肉还是会锁定。" 真嗣说道，声音里没有一丝情感。

'I'll save you… I'll save you… I'LL SAVE YOU!' If someone stood on the balcony that time, they would be intimidated by Shinji – by his glowing eyes.
'我会救你…我会救你…我一定会救你！' 如果那时有人站在阳台上，他们一定会被真嗣——被他那双发光的眼睛所震慑。

Shinji mustered all his willpower and focused on one thought. Suddenly he felt a wave of strength surge through his body as he lifted Asuka up to a height just enough for her to grip onto the railings. She pulled herself up and grabbed Shinji's wrists, helping him up as well.
真嗣集中所有意志力，专注于一个念头。突然间，他感到一股力量涌遍全身，将明日香举起到刚好能抓住栏杆的高度。她顺势爬上去，抓住真嗣的手腕，也帮他爬了上来。

The Children laid on the floor, both panting heavily, their minds still high on the effects of adrenaline. "Baka… don't go overboard," Asuka said, hyperventilating but managed a genuine smile. "You're much stronger than you look."
两个孩子躺在地上，都喘着粗气，脑海中仍充斥着肾上腺素的影响。"笨蛋…别太过火了，" 明日香虽然呼吸急促，但还是露出了真心的微笑。"你比看起来要强壮得多。"

Shinji, on the other hand, was feeling a mix of anger and relief. "Asuka…what the hell were you doing?! You almost got us killed!"
另一方面，真嗣则是愤怒与宽慰交织。“明日香……你到底在搞什么？！你差点害死我们！”

Asuka's instinct was to retort, but she suppressed it since she knew she messed up BIG. "I'm…sorry, Shinji, I really am," she said in tears, "I was cold and lonely…I just want to come and share your warmth! The Janitors wouldn't allow me to…so I…"
明日香的本能反应是反驳，但她忍住了，因为她知道自己犯了大错。“对不起，真嗣，我真的……”她泪眼婆娑地说，“我好冷，好孤单……我只是想过来分享你的温暖！清洁工们不让我……所以我……”

Her words surprised Shinji, "what?! You…wanted to…what?"
她的话让真嗣感到惊讶，“什么？！你……想……什么？”

"I want to sleep with you!" She blurted out but soon blushed hard as she realized the connotational meaning of her statement, "I mean, not in the literal sense! Oh wait, perhaps in the exact literal meaning," she sighed, "just sleeping in the same bed to share the warmth! Nothing more!"
“我想和你一起睡！”她脱口而出，但随即因为意识到自己话中的双关含义而满脸通红，“我是说，不是那个意思！哦不，也许就是字面意思，”她叹了口气，“只是想在同一张床上睡觉，分享温暖！没有别的！”

"Oh, okay," Shinji blushed a little as well, "still… I'm really angry with this…incident. By the way, I think I remembered something," he pondered for a moment, "do you remember…piloting an EVA inside a volcano?"
哦，好吧，" 真嗣也微微脸红，"不过……我对这次……事件真的很生气。对了，我好像想起了什么，" 他沉思片刻，"你记得……在火山里驾驶 EVA 吗？

Asuka mused, and nodded, "yeah…when you were pulling me up, I had a strange feeling of déjà vu…" she took a deep breath, "I think…I was falling down in a volcano with my EVA, and you…came for me and pulled me up, just like…what you did just now." She smiled a warm smile, "heh…you saving me from falling down might as well be a universal constant." Asuka paused for a second before continuing, "Thank you, Shinji. For saving my life, twice." Although she didn't want to admit it - Asuka Langley Soryu needed Shinji. She'd never thought she needed anyone.
明日香若有所思地点点头，"嗯……当你拉我上来时，我有种奇怪的似曾相识感……" 她深吸一口气，"我觉得……我和我的 EVA 一起在火山里坠落，而你……来救我，拉我上来，就像……你刚才做的那样。" 她露出了温暖的微笑，"嘿……你从坠落中救我，简直成了宇宙常数。" 明日香停顿了一下，继续说道，"谢谢你，真嗣。两次救了我的命。" 尽管她不愿承认——明日香·兰格雷·索西尔需要真嗣。她从未想过自己需要任何人。

"Um, you're welcome?" Shinji replied, getting up from the ground, "I mean-"
嗯，不客气？" 真嗣回答道，从地上站起来，"我是说——

A finger on his lips silenced him in an instant, and a soft kiss on his right cheek stopped him from thinking – his world was spinning around him, Shinji forgot to move, forgot to breathe-
一根手指轻触他的嘴唇，瞬间让他沉默，一个温柔的吻落在他的右颊，让他停止了思考——他的世界在旋转，真嗣忘记了移动，忘记了呼吸——

"I think we should go to sleep, idiot," Asuka smiled, pulling away from the kiss, "c'mon, I'm getting cold out here!"
我觉得我们该去睡觉了，傻瓜，" 明日香笑着从吻中抽身，"快点，外面冷死了！

"How did my counterpart remember what happened in my original timeline?" The God Shinji frowned in confusion, "they didn't experience it, did they?"
我的另一个自己是怎么记得我原本时间线里发生的事的？" 神之真嗣皱眉困惑，"他们并没有经历过，对吧？

"Well, from my latest studies, it might have something to do with quantum interference," the God Asuka replied, walking out from Princeton University, the world around her paused since they needed a moment of privacy, "they didn't experience it, but we did. And we were occupying their brain for quite a while. Maybe our memories left a mark."
嗯，根据我最近的研究所示，可能与量子干扰有关，" 神之明日香回答道，她从普林斯顿大学走出，周围的世界因他们需要片刻私密而静止，"他们确实没有经历过，但我们有。而且我们在他们的大脑中占据了一段时间。或许我们的记忆留下了痕迹。

"I...guess," the God Shinji said, "I mean, it's not exactly a bad thing, right? If they remembered what happened in this timeline..." He trailed off.
"我...我想也是，" 神之真嗣说，"我是说，这并不是什么坏事，对吧？如果他们记得这个时间线里发生的事..." 他的话音渐渐消失。

"When you failed to save me, and then all the Angelic powers stuff," the God Asuka followed, "yeah, it would be...bad."
当你没能救下我，还有那些天使之力的事情，"神明日香接着说，"是啊，那可就糟糕了。

"How about my abnormal strength, though? Does this mean my counterpart's S2 organ somehow activated?" The God Shinji asked with dread.
"那我的异常力量又是怎么回事？难道这意味着我的对应者 S2 机关被激活了？"神真嗣带着恐惧问道。

"I don't know, really," the God Asuka sighed, "but seeing you still shiver from cold, I guess the answer is still 'no'. But it's getting close."
说实话，我也不清楚，"神明日香叹了口气，"但看你还在因为寒冷发抖，我想答案还是‘没有’。不过，已经很接近了。

AN: Some may think my fic is too light-hearted to be an EVA fanfic, however not only that's my main intention for this piece of fiction, but also the setting of this world doesn't really allow anything dark to happen. This isn't some post-impact world, nor it is in the middle of Angel wars. I simply want to give my favorite couple some happiness, as well as entertain my readers with a light-hearted and humorous pure love story with a full tsundere Asuka and manga & TV mix Shinji.
作者注：有些人可能认为我的同人文过于轻松，不像是《新世纪福音战士》的风格。然而，这正是我创作这篇小说的初衷。在这个世界设定中，并没有发生什么黑暗的事情。这里既不是后冲击时代，也未处于天使战争之中。我只想为最喜欢的这对情侣带来一些幸福，同时用一个轻松幽默、充满纯爱的故事来娱乐读者，其中明日香是个十足的傲娇，而真嗣则是漫画与电视剧混合体。

With that being said, I don't intend to make things smooth for them. Asuka and Shinji will have to, and had already overcome what all AsuShin couples have to overcome - their insecurities and past traumas. Some of the settings of this world are there to make my ideas work, so don't mind too much about technical a review if you like my story!
话虽如此，我并不打算让他们一帆风顺。明日香和真嗣必须，也已经克服了所有 AsuShin 情侣必须面对的挑战——他们的不安全感与过往创伤。这个世界的一些设定是为了让我的构思得以实现，所以如果你喜欢我的故事，就不必过于纠结技术层面的评价了！

### Chapter 8: Goodbye, Mothers Pt1
再见，母亲们 第一部分

Morning had just begun to grey the pre-dawn skies when Shinji woke. He blinked as he brushed strands of long red hair out of his face, wondering why he felt some sort of weight on his chest.
当真嗣醒来时，黎明的曙光才刚刚开始染灰夜空。他眨了眨眼，伸手将挡在脸上的几缕长长的红发拨开，心中纳闷为何感觉胸口有些沉重。

The alarm was not loud, but Shinji was used to wake in the first two seconds of its sound. He reached to deactivate it. A glance at the alarm told him it was 6:45 in the morning – half an hour before the collective wake-up call. He looked down and blushed a deep crimson - Asuka, laying on her side, clinging to him, her legs intertwined with his, her nightshirt lifted to half her torso. He silently blessed the fact that they both were still wearing sufficient clothing.
闹钟的声音并不响亮，但真嗣习惯于在它响起的前两秒醒来。他伸手去关掉它。瞥了一眼闹钟，显示是早上 6 点 45 分——比集体起床时间早了半小时。他低头一看，顿时满脸通红——明日香侧躺着，紧紧依偎在他身边，双腿与他的交缠在一起，睡衣撩起到半腰。他暗自庆幸两人都还穿着足够的衣物。

Shinji didn't remember falling asleep like this last night –the last thing he knew was he and Asuka laying back-to-back –albeit in the same sheet. She said something like 'don't turn around or I'll kill you.'
真嗣不记得昨晚是这样睡着的——他最后的记忆是和明日香背对背躺着——尽管同盖一床被子。她说的话仿佛是“别转身，否则我杀了你。”

Carefully disentangling himself, Shinji began to slowly rise from the king-sized bed. A grabbing hand suddenly made this difficult.
小心翼翼地挣脱束缚，真嗣开始缓缓从那张特大号床上起身。一只抓握的手突然让这变得困难。

"You not goin' 'nywhere…" A dizzy and muffled voice came from Asuka's half-sleeping form.
"你哪儿也别想去……" 明日香半睡半醒的身躯中传来一阵晕眩而含糊的声音。

"Asuka, it's morning", he pleaded just above a whisper, "you need to leave before the Janitors notice anything."
明日香，已经是早上了，" 他低声恳求，"你得在清洁工注意到之前离开。

"I hate it when you're 'ight…" Asuka stirred and slowly got up from the bed before looking down at her own appearance and their position in bed, her face instantly flushing, "how did we end up like this? You… didn't do anything improper, did you?"
你真是……" 明日香动了动，慢慢从床上坐起，低头审视自己的衣着和两人在床上的位置，脸颊瞬间泛红，"我们怎么会变成这样？你……没做什么不规矩的事吧？

"Wha-what? I-I just got up! I di-didn't do anything!" Shinji stammered, his blush turned into an incandescent one.
"什、什么？我、我才刚起床！我什、什么都没做啊！" 真嗣结结巴巴地说道，他的脸红得发烫。

"I trust you not do anything perverted, Baka, that's why I came here in the first place," Asuka yawned and stood on the floor, tidying up her messy hair and clothes, "you may be a Baka, but you're the kind of Baka who's honest," she added with a smile. "Thanks for the warmth, and I had a good dream last night as well," Asuka said, putting on the coat she wore last night.
"我相信你不会做出什么下流的事，笨蛋，所以我才来这里的，" 明日香打着哈欠站起身，整理着凌乱的头发和衣服，"你虽然是个笨蛋，但至少是个诚实的笨蛋，" 她微笑着补充道。"谢谢你的温暖，而且我昨晚还做了个好梦呢，" 明日香说着，穿上了昨晚穿的外套。

"Um, you're welcome?" Shinji smiled an uneasy smile, "I mean, I-I'm glad to help." He relaxed a little, then frowned as he realized a problem, "Asuka, how'd you get back? I'm definitely NOT letting you climb the ladders!"
呃，不、不客气？" 真嗣勉强挤出一个笑容，"我的意思是，我、我很高兴能帮上忙。" 他稍微放松了一些，随即皱起眉头意识到一个问题，"明日香，你是怎么回来的？我绝对不会再让你爬梯子了！

"Right," Asuka sighed, "I'll just go back in the normal way. Hope the Janitors aren't up yet. I set the alarm early for this purpose," she explained, "Shinji, go and check for me! They don't know I'm here!"
好吧，" 明日香叹了口气，"我还是按正常方式回去吧。希望清洁工还没起床。我特意把闹钟调早了，" 她解释道，"真嗣，去帮我看看！他们不知道我在这里！

"Sure," Shinji agreed, walking to the door while Asuka hid behind the bed frame. He slowly and lightly cracked the door open, his head peeking out, scanning the corridor for any moving objects. Seeing none, he closed the door with a soft THUD and turned to Asuka's direction, who slowly stood up from her hiding place, "no one's out there, you're safe to go," he said, shaking his head.
"当然可以，" 真嗣答应着，走向门口，而明日香则躲在床架后面。他缓缓地、轻轻地推开门，探出头来，扫视走廊，寻找任何移动的物体。没有发现任何动静，他轻轻地关上门，发出一声微弱的砰响，然后转向明日香的方向，她慢慢地从藏身之处站了起来，"外面没人，你可以安全出去了，" 他说着，摇了摇头。

Asuka nodded and strode to the door, giving Shinji one last appreciative smile, taking a deep breath before opening the door. She peeked out her head and checked one last time, then exited the room in swift movements, closing the door behind her. Asuka's heart pounded crazily as she rushed to the elevator, not forgetting to use her arms to hide her face in front of security cameras. It might be a little overboard since sensei wouldn't really go as far as checking security footages just to see if anyone sneaked out their rooms during the night – but she couldn't take any risk.
明日香点了点头，大步走向门口，对真嗣投去一个感激的微笑，深吸一口气后打开了门。她探出头再次确认了一遍，然后迅速地离开了房间，随手关上了门。明日香的心跳得厉害，她冲向电梯，不忘在监控摄像头前用双臂遮住脸。虽然老师不太可能真的去查看监控录像，只为看看晚上是否有人偷偷溜出房间——但她不敢冒任何风险。

Fortunately, no one was in the hallway, no janitors, no cleaners, and most importantly –no other boys from the school. The rumors – ' yet they are getting closer to the truth,' a treacherous voice in Asuka's mind sounded, eliciting a blush from the redhead – would never see the end if she got caught by other boys.
幸好，走廊里空无一人，没有清洁工，没有保洁员，最重要的是——没有学校里的其他男生。那些流言——‘它们正逐渐逼近真相，’一个狡猾的声音在明日香心中响起，让红发少女不由得脸红——如果被其他男生抓到，这些流言就永无止境了。

Asuka leaned on the elevator wall, panting heavily, both from the physical effect and mental exhaustion. With a Ding, the door opened on the third floor.
明日香倚靠在电梯壁上，气喘吁吁，既有体力上的消耗，也有精神上的疲惫。随着“叮”的一声，电梯门在三楼打开了。

And an impatient, foot-tapping Mari Makinami was waiting outside.
而门外，是焦躁不安、脚尖轻敲地面的真希波·玛丽·伊兰崔亚斯。

The two just stared at each other without movements or sounds for the entire duration - from the elevator door opening to closing, before Mari raised and stuck her arm between the elevator doors at a lightning-fast speed.
两人就这样一动不动、一声不吭地对视着，从电梯门开启到闭合的整个过程中，直到玛丽以迅雷不及掩耳之势伸出胳膊，卡在了即将关闭的电梯门之间。

The elevator door opened again; Asuka composed herself and exited the elevator, trying to ignore the forgot-to-breath-in-shock brunette.
电梯门再次打开；明日香整理了一下情绪，走出电梯，试图忽略那个因震惊而忘记呼吸的棕发女孩。

Mari coughed, getting Asuka's attention; her half-amused, half-disbelieving expression making Asuka feel nothing good would happen next, "princess…tell me at least you guys used protection?"
玛丽咳嗽一声，吸引了明日香的注意；她那半是好笑半是难以置信的表情让明日香预感接下来不会有好事发生，“公主…至少告诉我，你们用了保护措施吧？”

Asuka blushed – much to Mari's amusement – and scowled, "We. Did. Not. Have. Sex." She hissed out every word with a threatening tone, "say one word about this, they'll never find your body." She threatened, "Am. I. Clear?"
明日香的脸颊泛起红晕——这让玛丽更加乐在其中——她皱起眉头，咬牙切齿地说：“我们。没有。发生。关系。”她每个字都带着威胁的语气，“你要是敢提这事，你的尸体将无人能寻。”她威胁道，“清·楚·了·吗？”

Mari gulped, her body tensing up. She'd heard about the infamous redheaded wrath from other students –personally facing it was another level of experience. "O-okay, not a word, you guys have fun," she hastily said, "I-I'll go have breakfast if you don't mind-"
玛丽咽了口唾沫，身体紧绷。她从其他学生那里听说过这位红发女子的可怕怒火——但亲身体验完全是另一回事。“好-好的，我一个字都不会说，你们玩得开心，”她急忙说道，“如-如果你不介意的话，我-我去吃早餐了——”

"Do whatever you want for all I care," Asuka turned to leave, feeling satisfied with the result, "remember, not a word. And we didn't have sex!"
你想干嘛就干嘛，我无所谓，" 明日香转身离去，对结果感到满意，"记住，一个字也别说。我们可没上床！

A violent, repetitive nod was the only answer from a very scared-looking Mari.
玛丽看起来非常害怕，只能用剧烈而重复的点头作为回答。

"Shinji, let's go for a walk," Asuka ambushed Shinji on his way out of the hotel cafeteria. Her unusually good mood in the morning was ruined by the undesired encounter with Mari, and the surprisingly tasty breakfast provided by the hotel did little to help with that. What's worse - the low temperature outside wasn't really suitable for swimming. Asuka grabbed his wrist and dragged him along.
"真嗣，我们去散散步吧，" 明日香在真嗣刚走出酒店餐厅时拦住了他。她早晨难得的好心情被与玛丽不期而遇的尴尬破坏了，而酒店提供的意外美味的早餐对此也无济于事。更糟的是——外面的低温实在不适合游泳。明日香抓住他的手腕，拉着他一起走。

"Um, okay," Shinji said, getting used to the pushy personality of the fiery redhead, but not without an internal sigh of defeat. He was used to be left alone and not cared for by anybody. In other matters, especially those that life threw at him - which tended to happen quite often since he became an EVA pilot – he simply tried to dodge the best he could, without thinking why all this is happening to him. When things became too much, he simply ran away, then returned when he realized the futility of running. It did not gain him friends, but it got him by.
"嗯，好吧，" 真嗣说道，逐渐习惯了这位火红发色女孩的强势性格，但内心不免叹息认命。他习惯于独来独往，无人关心。至于生活中抛给他的其他事情——自从成为 EVA 驾驶员后，这类事情频繁发生——他只是尽力躲避，不去深究为何这一切会降临到自己头上。当压力过大时，他便选择逃离，而后意识到逃避的无用，再默默返回。这并未为他赢得朋友，但至少让他得以生存。

This had changed. A lot.
这已经变了。很多。

Asuka burst into his life, turning it upside down almost as much as him being called to Tokyo-3 and shoved into an EVA. He didn't know what had caused them both to wake up on that beach – he also didn't know whether their 'former' relationship, as indicated by the prophesier, was anything like what they were having now. At first Asuka was a disruptive force that made him angry, even physically assaulted him; then she changed quickly, as she 'followed her heart' –also indicated by the prophesier. Shinji started to wonder just who the prophesier was? He seemed to know so much about the redhead and Shinji that his' relationship advices' were all critically important and useful.
明日香闯入了他的生活，几乎像他被召唤到第三新东京市并被塞进 EVA 一样，彻底颠覆了他的世界。他不知道是什么原因让他们俩在那片海滩上醒来——他也不确定，预言者所暗示的他们“之前”的关系，是否与他们现在的相处方式有任何相似之处。起初，明日香是一个令人恼火的干扰因素，甚至对他进行了身体攻击；然后她迅速转变，正如预言者所暗示的，她“追随了自己的心”。真嗣开始好奇，这位预言者究竟是谁？他似乎对红发女孩和真嗣了如指掌，他的“关系建议”都至关重要且实用。

'I wonder if I could make it this far without the prophesier's guidance…' Shinji mused as he and Asuka walked along the trail in a park near the beach in companionable silence. Asuka smiled a small smile as a cool morning breeze blew past her face, her mood slowly turning from cloudy to sunny.
“如果没有预言者的指引，我能否走到这一步呢……”真嗣沉思着，与明日香一同沿着海滩附近公园的小径漫步，两人在默契的沉默中前行。明日香迎着清晨凉爽的微风，脸上露出一丝微笑，她的心情逐渐从阴霾转为晴朗。

"Shinji…" Asuka started, looking up to the sky, her voice uncertain.
"真嗣……"明日香开口道，抬头望向天空，声音中带着不确定。

"M?" Shinji acknowledged in a soft murmur.
"嗯？" 真嗣轻声应道。

"Do you trust me?" she asked out of the blue. Surprised by the serious question, Shinji slowly raised his head and looked at the redhead. "Asuka, we've been through so much together…the EVAs, and now all this…what makes you think I don't trust you?"
你信任我吗？" 她突然问道。被这个严肃的问题惊到，真嗣缓缓抬起头，望向那位红发少女。"明日香，我们一起经历了那么多……EVA，还有现在这一切……你为什么会觉得我不信任你呢？

She took a deep breath. "Just… making sure. Okay. I am going to ask you a question, and you better think well before you answer", she lowered her head and leveled with Shinji's. Their eyes met.
她深吸了一口气。"只是……确认一下。好吧。我要问你一个问题，你最好想清楚再回答"，她低下头，与真嗣的视线齐平，两人的目光交汇。

"Of course?" he replied matter-of-factly.
"当然？" 他实事求是地回答。

"Who am I to you?"
我是你的谁？

Shinji's lips narrowed to a thin line, his eyes turning thoughtful. There were, of course, numerous answers to that question: friend, coworker, classmates… not to mention the absurd 'ex'-girlfriend. But he knew that Asuka did not tell him to 'think well' just to give a first one. And she was looking at him, waiting with surprising patience. What could he say? What should he say?
真嗣的嘴唇紧抿成一条细线，眼神变得沉思。当然，这个问题有无数种答案：朋友、同事、同学……更不用提那荒谬的“前女友”身份。但他知道明日香让他“好好想想”，绝不是为了得到一个显而易见的回答。她正注视着他，以出乎意料的耐心等待着。他能说什么？他该说什么？

Shinji was nothing if not honest. He didn't want to see Asuka as someone he might love because God told him so; he wanted to develop his own feelings towards the girl. Shinji had never thought he would ever love someone else because he didn't even love himself; he only wanted affection from others so he could stay in the warm corner and never be hurt again.
真嗣若非诚实，便一无是处。他不想因为上帝的旨意而将明日香视为可能爱慕的对象；他希望自己对这位女孩产生真实的感情。真嗣从未想过自己会爱上别人，因为他连自己都不爱；他只渴望从他人那里获得关爱，以便能留在温暖的角落，不再受到伤害。

However, the redhead walking beside him was the first person in years to whom he actually wished to actively devote. Finally, he took a deep breath and decided to speak his heart, "You're the closest person to me," he said slowly. "I want to help you…I don't think there's a single word for that. I–" 'want to stay with you forever' was left unsaid since he wasn't sure whether she felt the same way –Shinji still feared rejection.
然而，身旁这位红发女孩却是多年来第一个让他真心愿意主动付出的人。最终，他深吸一口气，决定吐露心声，“你是我最亲近的人，”他缓缓说道，“我想帮助你……我觉得没有一个词能概括这种感觉。我——”‘想永远和你在一起’这句话未曾出口，因为他不确定她是否也有同样的感觉——真嗣仍然害怕被拒绝。

Asuka suddenly put the finger on his lips. "Thank you," she whispered. He noticed her voice was nervous, but he could have sworn her eyes gleamed with joy. "Listen… I'll get back to that, okay? I promise. I just need to think about it." He nodded carefully in response. "And I… I know we need to discuss that. I mean, really, really need to discuss that." she continued in an uncharacteristically uncertain voice. "But for now… you're the same to me. you're the closest I have to…" she trailed off. "Well, the closest one I have. That I ever had, I suppose", she sighed. "There was Kaji-" Shinji raised an eyebrow at her mention of his guardian. Still, he decided to listen up, "he was my guardian…back in Germany when I was training to be an EVA pilot, and he took care of me, so…but this Kaji didn't even know me, so I guess now you're the only one. And you better not fuck it up, too, because while I'm quite serene right now, I will kill you if you do."
明日香突然将手指放在唇边，轻声道：“谢谢你。”他察觉到她的声音带着紧张，但几乎可以肯定，她的眼中闪烁着喜悦。“听着……我会回来谈这个的，好吗？我保证。我只是需要时间思考。”他小心翼翼地点头回应。“而我……我知道我们必须讨论那件事。我是说，真的，真的需要讨论。”她继续说道，声音出奇地不确定。“但目前……你对我来说还是一样。你是我最亲近的人……”她话音渐弱，“嗯，是我曾经拥有过的最亲近的人。”她叹了口气，“曾经有加持先生——”听到她提及自己的监护人，真嗣扬起眉毛。尽管如此，他还是决定认真听下去，“他在德国时是我的监护人，那时我正在接受 EVA 驾驶员训练，他照顾过我，所以……但这个加持先生甚至不认识我，所以我想现在只有你了。你最好别搞砸，因为虽然我现在很平静，但如果你搞砸了，我会杀了你。”

That answered his questions about Asuka's initial behaviors around Kaji. Shinji smiled and took the hand that was silencing him in his own, squeezing it hard. "I…promise?" He smiled. Asuka closed her eyes; her body was shaking softly. "Asuka…Are you alright?" He asked with a concerning look.
这解答了他对明日香最初在加持周围行为的疑问。真嗣微笑着，握住那只捂住他嘴巴的手，紧紧地捏了一下。"我…保证？"他微笑着说。明日香闭上眼睛，身体微微颤抖。"明日香…你还好吗？"他关切地问道。

"Never better," Asuka replied with a smile, "you may be a Baka, but the kind of Baka who keeps his promises. Let's continue walking, I'm enjoying it."
再好不过了，"明日香微笑着回答，"你或许是个笨蛋，但却是那种会遵守承诺的笨蛋。我们继续走吧，我很享受这个时刻。

The duo resumed walking in silence, smiles on both of their faces. A glitter of sunshine broke out of the cumulus, shining on the former pilots through the cracks between layers of green leaves.
两人继续默默地走着，脸上都挂着微笑。一束阳光从积云中透出，穿过层层绿叶的缝隙，照耀在两位前驾驶员身上。

The moment of tranquility was interrupted by a round of laughter and chaotic footsteps. Asuka suddenly stopped as she recognized the voice belonged to Takumi. A gust of wind started blowing as the clouds gathered, covering the sun. A chill ran down Asuka's spine; she turned and grabbed Shinji's wrist, "let's get out of there."
宁静的时刻被一阵笑声和杂乱的脚步声打断。明日香突然停下，她听出那声音属于琢磨。一阵风开始吹起，云层聚集，遮住了太阳。一股寒意沿着明日香的脊背而下；她转身抓住真嗣的手腕，"我们快离开这里。"

"What's wrong?" Shinji frowned but made no resistance, following the redhead.
"怎么了？" 真嗣皱了皱眉，但没有反抗，跟着红发女孩走去。

"Damn it!" Asuka hissed, "we were having a moment! And it has to be ruined by some random jerks!" She stomped her foot in frustration, emitting a murderous aura.
"该死！" 明日香低声咒骂，"我们正有点感觉呢！偏偏被几个莫名其妙的家伙给搅和了！" 她气愤地跺脚，散发出一股杀气。

Maybe it was their voices that went too loud, maybe it was the sound of their footsteps, the group of upper-classmen noticed the presence of other people in this particularly remote part of the park.
或许是他们的声音太大，或许是脚步声，总之，那群高年级生注意到了这个特别偏僻的公园角落里还有其他人。

"Yo, isn't that Shikinami?" a male voice sounded, "Hey guys, look who's there?"
哟，那不是式波吗？" 一个男声响起，"嘿，大家看那是谁？

The group of males approached the duo slowly. 'Mein Gott, how unlucky,' Asuka thought with bitterness and rising anger, 'do I have to come here and relax with Shinji, just to accidentally run into these morons? So fucking unfortunate.'
那群男生缓缓向两人逼近。“天哪，真倒霉，”明日香心中苦涩，怒火渐升，“我特地来这里和真嗣放松一下，偏偏又碰上这些蠢货？真他妈的晦气。”

"Hey there hot stuff, is he your little boyfriend?" Takumi approached with a sly grin, "how about you ditch that dork and come with us? I'll show you a good time." He eyed his companies, who immediately understood his intentions and quickly formed a circle around the duo.
“嘿，美女，他是你的小男友吗？”琢磨带着狡黠的笑容走近，“不如甩了那个呆子，跟我们走吧？我保证让你玩得开心。”他瞥了一眼同伴，他们立刻心领神会，迅速围成一圈将两人困在中间。

Asuka looked around her. Each one of the bullies was giving her the eye. Asuka wanted to puke.
明日香环顾四周，每个恶霸都色眯眯地盯着她。明日香感到一阵恶心。

"Fuck off right now so you can leave in whole," Asuka said coldly, "I thought one trip to the hospital was enough a lesson for you."
“立刻滚蛋，免得缺胳膊少腿，”明日香冷冷地说，“我以为上次住院已经给你们足够的教训了。”

The group of bullies first looked at each other dumbfounded, then burst out laughing. "Very funny, Shikinami. There're four of us, your little boyfriend can't do anything, and you're nothing but a helpless little girl…" Takumi said, "Just make it easy for us so we won't hurt you so much…"
那群恶霸先是面面相觑，随即哄堂大笑。“真逗，式波。我们这儿有四个人，你那小男友也做不了什么，而你不过是个无助的小姑娘……”拓海说道，“乖乖听话，我们下手会轻点，免得你太受罪……”

"She's the one who put you into a hospital for a day?" Another bully suddenly asked, "bro, you sure this is a good idea?" He seemed intimidated by the glare that rivaled Ramiel's particle beam.
“就是她让你住院一天的？”另一个恶霸突然问道，“兄弟，你确定这是个好主意吗？”他似乎被那道堪比雷米尔粒子炮的目光震慑住了。

"Shut it Yin! I was careless, which she took full advantage of," Takumi said, "now with four of us, I'll show this little girl where she truly belongs! She made a fool of me in front of the girls! She's so gonna pay for it!"
“闭嘴，银！我只是大意了，让她有机可乘，”拓海说，“现在我们四个人，我要让这小丫头知道她真正的位置！她让我在女生面前丢尽了脸！她得为此付出代价！”

Utilizing their moment of distraction, Asuka gave Shinji a look and made several gestures. Shinji nodded as he understood that Asuka wanted to execute a simultaneous attack on Takumi, using the strategy they used against the Israfel as they remembered.
趁着他们分神的瞬间，明日香给真嗣使了个眼色，并做了几个手势。真嗣点头表示理解，明日香打算同时对拓海发起攻击，运用他们对抗伊斯拉斐尔时的战术，两人记忆犹新。

"Alright Shinji, on my mark, 3, 2, 1, MARK!" Asuka said in German –thankfully she had taught him the basics of the language, which now proved to be a good choice.
"好了，真嗣，听我口令，3，2，1，开始！" 明日香用德语说道——幸好她之前教过他一些基础，现在看来这是个明智之举。

In a blink of an eye, both Children dashed forward; Asuka kicked Takumi in the groin, while Shinji elbowed him in the gut. She then slid into his legs while Shinji kneed him in his jaw. Asuka quickly recovered from her slide and took Takumi's right arm behind his back and bent it in an unnatural formation. Takumi fainted under the intolerable pain and fell flat on the ground, blood dripping down from his holes.
眨眼间，两位少年如离弦之箭般冲出；明日香一脚踢中高木的裆部，而真嗣则肘击其腹部。接着，明日香滑铲至其腿间，真嗣则膝撞其下巴。明日香迅速起身，将高木的右臂反扭至背后，形成一个不自然的弯曲。无法忍受的剧痛让高木昏厥过去，倒地不起，鲜血从他的伤口中渗出。

Takumi's three buddies watched the whole ordeal transfixed since neither of them knew those small-looking kids possessed so much power and combat skills. As Asuka turned her glare to them, they were already on their feet running –and intercepted by a dozen black-suit-wearing, gun-holding Section 2 Agents.
高木的三个同伙目睹了整个过程，惊得目瞪口呆，他们万万没想到这两个看似弱小的孩子竟有如此强大的力量和战斗技巧。当明日香将目光转向他们时，他们已经拔腿就跑——却被一队身穿黑西装、手持枪械的第二课特工拦截。

Both Children were surprised at the appearance of Section 2, but they decided to worry about it later. Asuka looked down at the guy on the ground who's still breathing; her look changed from angry to complete contempt and disgust.
两位少年对第二课的出现感到意外，但决定稍后再考虑这个问题。明日香低头看着地上仍在喘息的家伙；她的表情从愤怒转为彻底的蔑视和厌恶。

"Disgrace of humanity," Asuka said, her tone freezing cold, "I wonder how we are the same species."
人性的耻辱，" 明日香说道，语气冰冷刺骨，"我真好奇我们怎么会是同一种族。

Asuka wanted to say why she chose Shinji – all the reasons she had come to realize during the past three weeks. She would say them just for Shinji to hear. But she reckoned it could wait. The person – no, the scum that was constituted by human cells – wasn't even worth hearing it.
明日香本想解释她为何选择了真嗣——过去三周里她逐渐明白的所有理由。她只想让真嗣听到这些话。但她觉得可以再等等。那个人——不，那个由人类细胞构成的渣滓——根本不配听这些。

Asuka turned to Shinji and grabbed his wrist, "let's go Shinji. Let Section 2 do their jobs. I'm leaving this place –we'll go back to Tokyo-3 tomorrow, alright?" Her face showing a bit of worry since she wasn't sure whether Shinji would want-
明日香转向真嗣，抓住他的手腕，"我们走吧，真嗣。让第二支部去做他们的事。我要离开这个地方——我们明天回第三新东京市，好吗？" 她的脸上露出一丝担忧，因为她不确定真嗣是否愿意——

"Where you go, I'll go too, Asuka," Shinji replied with an understanding smile, "I don't want to stay here any longer as well. I mean…so much had happened since we got here."
你去哪儿，我就去哪儿，明日香，" 真嗣带着理解的微笑回答，"我也不想再留在这里了。我的意思是……自从我们来到这儿，发生了太多事。

"Yeah," Asuka sighed before smiling back, her darkened mood improved a little, "I'll tell Misato to arrange it for us."
嗯，" 明日香叹了口气，随即回以微笑，心情稍有好转，"我会让美里帮我们安排的。

"See, no one messes with God's pairings," the God Asuka huffed before smiling, "they've made some real progress! I suppose acting as my subconscious really helped."
看吧，没人敢搅乱神的配对，" 神明明日香哼了一声，随后露出笑容，"他们确实取得了不少进展！我想，扮演我的潜意识确实有帮助。

"Of course," the God Shinji replied, "even without our help, our counterparts will eventually get together, albeit slower. Our past experiences draw us together." He trailed off. "Um, what do we do now?"
当然，" 神明真嗣回应道，"即使没有我们的帮助，我们的对应者最终也会走到一起，只是会慢一些。我们过去的经历让我们彼此吸引。" 他停顿了一下，"呃，我们现在该做什么呢？

"I say we continue from where we left off," the God Asuka said with a seductive smile, a smile the God Shinji couldn't be more familiar with. "Sure, I'm coming darling."
我觉得我们应该从上次停下的地方继续，" 神明明日香带着诱惑的微笑说道，这个微笑对神明真嗣来说再熟悉不过了。"好的，我这就来，亲爱的。

A lone girl laid in her bed, brooding about the events that happened that day, and the day before. In the afternoon, she tried to enjoy herself; she really did. Asuka even joined Rei and Mari to play some beach volleyball, but her mood didn't see significant improvement.
一个孤独的女孩躺在床上，沉思着当天以及前一天发生的事情。下午，她试图让自己开心起来；她真的尽力了。明日香甚至加入了绫波和真希波一起打沙滩排球，但她的心情并没有明显好转。

Then she went scuba diving with Shinji. She had fun during the time – in retrospect, it was mainly because of Shinji's presence, not much to do with the actual diving.
之后她和真嗣一起去潜水。那段时间她玩得很开心——回想起来，主要是因为真嗣的陪伴，与实际的潜水关系不大。

Asuka tossed and turned in the bed, unable to sleep. There was no way she could go to his room now –one of the reasons she didn't want to stay here any longer. Last night was so peaceful –no nightmares, no taunting memories –nothing but warmth. She feared she would get addicted to sleeping that way –as comfortable as it was, it's still somewhat improper for a boy and a girl at their age to sleep in the same room, much less the same bed. Unless they were-
明日香在床上辗转反侧，难以入睡。她现在不可能去他的房间了——这也是她不想在这里多待的原因之一。昨晚是如此平静——没有噩梦，没有嘲弄的回忆——只有温暖。她害怕自己会沉迷于那样的睡眠——尽管舒适，但对于他们这个年纪的男孩和女孩来说，同处一室，更不用说同床共枕，终究有些不妥。除非他们是——

"Right," Asuka sighed. The appearance of that particular thought didn't bother her as much as it did the last time. In fact the thought acted as a cue – Asuka took out the nightshirt she wore last night, sniffing it as she put the shirt close to her nose. It smelled the vanilla shower gel, laundry detergent – and a faint smell of Shinji.
"好吧，" 明日香叹了口气。那个念头再次出现，但这次她并不像上次那样感到困扰。实际上，这个念头成了一种提示——明日香拿出昨晚穿的睡衣，将它贴近鼻子嗅了嗅。衣服上散发着香草沐浴露和洗衣粉的味道，还夹杂着一丝真嗣的气息。

Asuka calmed down as her turmoil of thoughts was wiped away by the simple smell. She couldn't explain it –she felt like her brain somehow was used to the smell when sleeping.
简单的气味驱散了明日香脑海中的纷乱思绪，她平静了下来。她无法解释——仿佛她的身体在睡眠时已经习惯了这种气味。

Asuka smiled and padded it on the pillow. With his smell nearby she quickly settled down, slowly drifting into sleep.
明日香微笑着，将睡衣轻轻拍在枕头上。有了他的气息在旁，她很快就安顿下来，渐渐沉入梦乡。

Asuka opened her eyes, finding herself sitting in a train, sitting across her was a girl wearing a yellow sundress; she had red hair and blue eyes, two A-10 neural clips - which Asuka immediately recognized –sitting on top of her head. Asuka frowned; she didn't wear the neural connectors Gehirn gave her since they were ugly, and the former purpose of wearing them all day was to tell the world she was an EVA pilot. Now EVAs weren't even a thing, so there's no point in wearing those neural connectors anymore. However she was still aware of Gehirn's reputation, at least in Tokyo-3, so instead of the neural connectors she chose Gehirn employee breastpin – which did a better job raising people's eyebrows, much to her satisfaction.
明日香睁开眼睛，发现自己坐在一列火车上，对面坐着一个穿黄色太阳裙的女孩；她有着红色的头发和蓝色的眼睛，头顶上戴着两个 A-10 神经连接器——明日香立刻认了出来。明日香皱了皱眉；她自从觉得那些神经连接器难看之后就没再戴过，以前整天戴着它们是为了向世界宣告自己是 EVA 驾驶员。现在连 EVA 都不存在了，再戴那些神经连接器也没意义了。不过她仍然清楚 Gehirn 在第三新东京市的声誉，所以她选择了佩戴 Gehirn 员工胸针——这更能引起人们的注意，让她颇为满意。

"What the fuck?" She murmured to herself, "am I looking at a mirror?"
“搞什么鬼？”她喃喃自语，“我这是在照镜子吗？”

"No you aren't," the other Asuka spoke up.
“你不是，”另一个明日香开口了。

"Then who the hell are you? I'm definitely dreaming," Asuka huffed, "and why do you have the A-10 clips?" She was assaulted by a wave of nostalgia.
“那你到底是谁？我肯定是在做梦，”明日香哼了一声，“还有，你为什么戴着 A-10 连接器？”她被一股怀旧之情猛烈冲击。

"Look, I'm your subconscious," the other Asuka explained, "you called me for help and here I am."
听着，我是你的潜意识，"另一个明日香解释道，"你呼唤我寻求帮助，我这不就来了。

"What the hell are you talking about? I don't remember calling anyone for help!" Asuka barked.
"你到底在胡说些什么？我可不记得有呼唤过谁来帮忙！"明日香怒吼道。

The subconscious-Asuka frowned, "you subconsciously called me for help, alright?!" She seemed irritated, "that's why I'm your subconscious in the first place!"
潜意识中的明日香皱起眉头，"你是潜意识里呼唤我帮忙的，明白了吗？！"她显得有些恼火，"所以我才是你的潜意识！"

"Even if I did, I don't need it now!" Asuka shot back, "you can get lost for all I care!"
就算我真那么做了，我现在也不需要了！"明日香反驳道，"你爱消失就消失吧，我才不在乎！

The subconscious Asuka grumbled in frustration, "gottverdammt! Why are you so stubborn! I'm trying to help damn it! For the love of God just accept it!"
潜意识的明日香懊恼地嘟囔着：“该死的！你怎么这么固执！我这是在帮你，真是的！看在上帝的份上，你就接受吧！”

"Why should I?! Now fuck off my face before I hurt you!" Asuka threatened.
“我为什么要接受？！现在给我滚开，不然我可要对你不客气了！”明日香威胁道。

The subconscious-Asuka clenched her fists, "ANTA BAKA?!" She roared, "acting headstrong leas you nowhere!"
潜意识中的明日香紧握双拳，怒吼道：“你这个笨蛋？！”她咆哮着，“逞强只会让你无处可去！”

"Well, you do sound an awful lot like me," Asuka huffed, "if you're really my subconscious, you should've already known what kind of person I am! Don't get too surprised when I'm acting like myself!"
“哼，你说话的口气还真像我，”明日香哼了一声，“如果你真是我的潜意识，你应该早就知道我是什么样的人了！我表现得像我自己时，别太惊讶！”

"Do you really know yourself, though?" The subconscious-Asuka suddenly asked, "cuz from what I know you don't!
你真的了解自己吗？"潜意识中的明日香突然发问，"据我所知，你并不了解！

The accusation caught Asuka off guard, "(cough) wh-what are you implying by that?!"
这突如其来的指责让明日香措手不及，"(咳咳)你……你这话是什么意思？！"

The other Asuka smirked in triumph, "did I stutter?"
另一个明日香得意地咧嘴一笑，"我结巴了吗？"

"Well, enlighten me, then!" Asuka barked.
"那好，给我说清楚！"明日香厉声道。

"No, I need you to answer by yourself!" The subconscious-Asuka said, "first question, who are you?"
不，我需要你自己回答！"潜意识中的明日香说道，"第一个问题，你是谁？

Asuka frowned and put her fingers under her chin, pondering for a moment before she spoke up, "well that's easy. I was an elite, world's best EVA pilot! And I am a test subject for Gehirn, no one else in the world except Baka-Shinji could do my job! I am the great Asuka Langley Soryu!"
明日香皱起眉头，手指轻触下巴，沉思片刻后开口道："这很简单。我曾是精英，世界顶尖的 EVA 驾驶员！我还是 Gehirn 的试验对象，全世界除了笨蛋真嗣没人能胜任我的工作！我就是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！"

The subconscious-Asuka looked…amused, barely able to hold back a chuckle, as if she was looking at a childish brat, "well, you're not wrong, however," she trailed off, seeing Asuka raising a threatening eyebrow, as if saying 'dispute me and I'll destroy you', "who do you want to be, though?"
潜意识中的明日香看起来有些好笑，几乎忍不住要笑出声，仿佛在看一个幼稚的小鬼，"嗯，你说的没错，但是，"她话锋一转，注意到明日香挑起威胁性的眉毛，仿佛在说'敢反驳我就灭了你'，"你想要成为什么样的人呢？"

"What are you implying by that? I'm perfectly fine with who I am right now!"
你这话什么意思？我对自己现在的样子非常满意！

"Don't lie to me, especially not yourself, little girl," the subconscious-Asuka snorted, "Who. Do. You. Want. To. Be?" She hissed out word by word, glaring at Asuka that looked right into her soul.
"别对我撒谎，尤其是不要对自己撒谎，小姑娘，"潜意识中的明日香哼了一声，"你.到.底.想.成.为.谁？"她一字一顿地吐出这些话，目光如炬地盯着明日香，仿佛直视她的灵魂。

Asuka flinched before sighing in defeat, "I…I just want to be myself, just be Asuka Langley Soryu," she admitted, "I don't want those stupid façades!"
明日香退缩了一下，随后叹了口气，认输道："我……我只是想做我自己，就做明日香·兰格雷·索西尔，"她坦白说，"我不想再戴那些愚蠢的面具了！"

The subconscious-Asuka smiled, "hm, there's hope for you after all," she scoffed, "how do you reckon you should do that, then?"
潜意识中的明日香笑了笑，"哼，看来你还有救，"她嘲讽道，"那你打算怎么做呢？"

"I…I honestly don't know," Asuka put up her defenses once more, "I don't even know why I'm telling you all this! What are you, a psychotherapist or something?"
我……我真的不知道，"明日香再次筑起心理防线，"我甚至不知道为什么要跟你说这些！你是什么人，心理治疗师之类的吗？

"Your secrets are safe with me," the subconscious-Asuka reassured, "look, like I said I'm just your subconscious. Talking to me is just like talking to yourself!"
你的秘密在我这里很安全，"潜意识中的明日香安慰道，"看，就像我说的，我只是你的潜意识。和我说话就像是在自言自语！

"Right," Asuka looked down at the floor, though not speaking anymore.
"嗯，"明日香低头看着地板，尽管不再说话。

"Argh you're hopeless," the subconscious-Asuka groaned in annoyance, "you want to find someone special, who will accept you for who you truly are –Asuka Langley Soryu, not the elite EVA pilot or some one-in-billion test subject," she pointed out, eliciting narrowed eyes from Asuka, "and I'm sure you've already found o-"
唉，你真是无可救药，"潜意识中的明日香不耐烦地叹息，"你想要找到一个特别的人，一个能接受真实的你——惣流·明日香·兰格雷，而不是什么精英 EVA 驾驶员或亿万中选一的实验对象，"她指出，引得明日香眯起了眼睛，"我相信你已经找到了某——

"WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?!" Asuka interrupted loudly, "AS IF I'D EVER NEED SOMEONE!"
你到底想说什么？！"明日香大声打断，"我怎么可能需要别人！

"But you already did!" The subconscious-Asuka shot back, "and you know perfectly well who I'm talking about!"
但你已经做了！"潜意识中的明日香反驳道，"而且你非常清楚我在说谁！

Asuka wanted to retort, but found herself unable to – not in front of a mountain of undeniable evidence. "Even if I truly need that Baka, how can I be sure he won't abandon me once he's done with me?!"
明日香想要反驳，却发现自己无法开口——面对堆积如山的铁证。"即使我真的需要那个笨蛋，我怎么确定他不会用完我就抛弃我呢？！"

"He won't, ever," the other Asuka said calmly, "he needs you as well. You're so similar in so many ways that other people don't even dare to imagine. You two are the only ones in the world who could possibly understand each other!"
他永远不会，"另一个明日香平静地说，"他也需要你。你们在许多方面如此相似，以至于其他人都不敢想象。你们两个是世界上唯一可能真正理解彼此的人！

"I still need to make sure by myself before I try anything!" Asuka finally spoke after a long silence.
"我还是得亲自确认一下，再考虑尝试任何事情！"明日香在长时间的沉默后终于开口说道。

"Sure, just don't make him wait too long," the subconscious-Asuka started fading away with the surroundings, "remember, I'm always here to help!"
当然，只是别让他等太久，"潜意识中的明日香随着周围环境逐渐消散，"记住，我随时都在这里帮忙！

Asuka grudgingly opened her eyes, wondering why she felt more exhausted than usual –not exactly tired, but mentally exhausted. She shook the dizziness off –her eyes widened as last night's memories came back to her.
明日香不情愿地睁开眼睛，纳闷为何自己比往常更疲惫——并非身体上的疲倦，而是精神上的耗竭。她摇了摇头，驱散眩晕感——当昨晚的记忆涌回脑海时，她的眼睛瞪大了。

"Scheiße…" 该死……

The God Shinji chuckled, eliciting an intense glare from the God Asuka, "got anything to say, THIRD?"
神明真嗣轻笑一声，引来了神明明日香锐利的目光，“有什么要说的吗，第三？”

“没、没什么！”真嗣急忙回答，“对不起！”

"Seriously though, they sent Section 2 agents all the way here?!" Asuka complained as she and Shinji waited for Gehirn's private jet to arrive. Their belongings were packed neatly, sitting beside them.
"说真的，他们居然派了第二课的特工大老远来这里？！" 明日香抱怨道，她和真嗣正等待着 Gehirn 的私人飞机到来。他们的行李整齐地放在身旁。

"Um, it's not a bad thing? I mean, they did help us in the end…" Shinji replied halfheartedly, not looking at the redhead, seemingly having a lot on his mind.
"呃，这也不是坏事吧？毕竟，他们最后确实帮了我们……" 真嗣心不在焉地回答，没有看向红发少女，似乎心事重重。

"We could've defeated all four of them with ease! We had combat training, don't forget," Asuka shoved her hair behind her ear.
"我们本可以轻松击败他们四个的！别忘了，我们接受过战斗训练，" 明日香一边说，一边将头发撩到耳后。

"M."

Asuka frowned, "hey Baka! Oi, earth to Shinji!" Getting no replies whatsoever from him, she nudged Shinji in the rib cage with some force, which worked instantly, "ouch! A-Asuka? What was that for?" He rubbed the sour spot, finally looking into her blue eyes.
明日香皱起眉头，"喂，笨蛋！喂，真嗣，你听见了吗！" 见他毫无反应，她用力捅了捅他的肋骨，这一下立刻见效，"哎哟！A-Asuka？你这是干嘛？" 他揉着酸痛的地方，终于看向她那双蓝色的眼睛。

"What are you brooding on?" Asuka asked, frowning.
"你在琢磨什么呢？" 明日香皱着眉头问道。

"Nothing," he tried. "没什么，" 他试图掩饰。

"Bullshit, I know that face, all too well," Asuka claimed. "Okay, timeout", she took a quick look around, grabbed his elbow, and pulled him into a quiet corner in one smooth move. "Okay, we have about", Asuka took a quick look at her small red watch, "ten minutes before Section 2 Agents arrive and escort us home. So, skip the beating around the bush. What happened?"
胡说，我太熟悉那张脸了，" 明日香断言道。"好吧，暂停一下，" 她迅速环顾四周，抓住他的胳膊，一气呵成地将他拉到一个僻静的角落。"好了，我们大约有"，明日香瞥了一眼她那块小巧的红色手表，"十分钟时间，第二部门的特工会来把我们送回家。所以，别绕弯子了，到底发生了什么？

"N-nothing–" he tried again. A glare cut him off. "Hey. I'm trying to help, for fuck's sake, and I'm not going to hurt you, whatever the fuck you say. Fess up now, promise me you'll explain later, but don't leave me hanging", she demanded, grabbing his hand.
"没…没什么——" 他再次尝试开口。一道严厉的目光让他闭了嘴。"嘿，我他妈的是想帮忙，而且不管你说什么，我都不会伤害你。现在就坦白，答应我待会儿会解释清楚，但别让我干着急，" 她要求道，紧紧抓住他的手。

Shinji took a deep breath. "It's… not really important", his tone quite convincing.
真嗣深吸了一口气。"其实… 并不重要，" 他的语气相当有说服力。

"Bullshit," Asuka smirked. "It's important enough if you aren't even blushing when I'm holding your hand," she lifted their hands up in front of his eyes.
"胡扯，" 明日香冷笑道。"如果我握着你的手你都不脸红，那这事肯定够重要的，" 她举起他们的手，放在他眼前。

Shinji's lips were a thin line. He was sorely tempted to repeat his reassurance, but he knew Asuka well enough to know it would bring nothing. The closest option was to tell her to drop the subject, but she formulated it in a way that made polite handling impossible. The only thing left was then the truth, mortifying as it might have been.
真嗣的嘴唇抿成了一条细线。他极力想再次重复他的安慰，但他足够了解明日香，知道那样做毫无意义。最接近的选择是让她别再提这事，但她表达的方式使得礼貌处理变得不可能。剩下的唯一选择就是说出真相，尽管这可能令人难堪。

"Just… wondering," he admitted after a pause. "I… I don't know what I did to… deserve this."
只是……有点好奇，"他停顿了一下后承认道，"我……我不知道我做了什么……值得这样。

"Deserve what?" Asuka frowned.
"值得什么？"明日香皱起了眉头。

"Well, erm, you," Shinji's cheeks turned pink, "I mean, you being nice to me, all that stuff…"
就是，呃，你，"真嗣的脸颊泛起了红晕，"我的意思是，你对我的好，所有那些……

Asuka's palm met her face; her jaw clenched. 'God damn it, Shinji. And I thought I was the World Champion of Self-doubts.' "Listen…" she started slowly, picking her words carefully. "I don't know what's going in your head, okay? But you know, I wasn't exactly nice to you when we…first met, right?" Shinji nodded with an embarrassed expression, Asuka turned red-faced as well, "but you did something right, and I'm NOT letting you go! Is that enough for you?"
明日香的掌心贴在脸上，她的下巴紧绷。“该死的，真嗣。我还以为我是自我怀疑的世界冠军呢。”她缓缓开口，斟酌着措辞，“听着……我不知道你脑子里在想什么，好吗？但你知道，我们第一次见面时，我对你并不友好，对吧？”真嗣尴尬地点头，明日香也涨红了脸，“但你做对了什么，我绝不会让你离开！这对你来说够了吗？”

"Thank you, Asuka." He nodded again and smiled a small smile.
“谢谢你，明日香。”他再次点头，露出一丝微笑。

Asuka let out a heavy sigh. "Gott, and I thought I should be the one self-doubting how I deserved your kindness when I did nothing but torment you... And before you start apologizing, keep in mind that I can choke you right now."
明日香重重地叹了口气。“天啊，我本以为我应该怀疑自己是否配得上你的善意，毕竟我除了折磨你什么也没做……在你开始道歉之前，记住我现在就能掐死你。”

Shinji gulped, mustering all his willpower to squash an automatic apologize, just in time to catch it before it came out of his mouth –he didn't want to die yet, there were still good things in his life – the person who just threatened to kill him was the major one.
真嗣咽了口唾沫，竭尽全力压制住本能的道歉，及时在话出口前将其止住——他还不想死，生活中仍有美好的事物——那个刚刚威胁要杀他的人就是其中最重要的一个。

"Tadaima!" Both Children announced in unison as they entered the Katsuragi residence. They went to Shinji's apartment first, Asuka helped him sort out his stuff; as payback, he needed to help her sort out her stuff. Shinji's eyes wandered back and forth between his one small suitcase and Asuka's two huge suitcases, sweatdropping as he realized it wasn't really a fair trade.
"我回来了！"两个孩子异口同声地宣布，他们走进了葛城家。他们先去了真嗣的公寓，明日香帮他整理东西；作为回报，他需要帮她整理东西。真嗣的目光在自那一个小行李箱和明日香那两个大行李箱之间来回游移，意识到这实在不是一场公平的交易，不禁汗颜。

"Welcome home kids!" Misato's cheerful voice came from the kitchen, eliciting shivers ran down both children's spine as they realized the only thing she would be doing in the kitchen at that time of the day. "Take a seat around the table! Lunch will be ready in ten minutes!" Yep, that confirmed their fears.
"欢迎回家，孩子们！"美里欢快的声音从厨房传来，让两个孩子脊背发凉，因为他们意识到这个时间她会在厨房做什么。"围着桌子坐下吧！午饭十分钟后就好！"没错，这证实了他们的担忧。

Both Children made a face, "no thanks Misato! We'll order some takeout," they said in sync. Asuka went to pick up the landline while Shinji carried the suitcases to Asuka's room –as she 'generously permitted' him to do it.
两个孩子做了个鬼脸，"不用了，美里！我们点外卖吧，"他们异口同声地说。明日香去拿座机，而真嗣则把行李箱搬到明日香的房间——这是她"慷慨允许"他做的。

Misato pouted, "Hey! My newest curry isn't that bad!" She protested, "Kaji had already tested it out!"
美里撅起嘴，"嘿！我新做的咖喱没那么糟吧！"她抗议道，"加持已经试过了！"

"Speaking of Kaji, where is him?" Shinji asked, walking out of Asuka's room, "I haven't seen him since we came back. You said you were going to hang out with him, right Misato-san?"
说到加持先生，他去哪儿了？" 真嗣边走出明日香的房间边问道，"自从我们回来后就没见到他。你不是说要和他出去玩吗，美里小姐？

"Yeah, and he's in the hospital right now," Misato said, her tone completely unserious while it should be.
"是啊，他现在在医院呢，" 美里回答，语气本应严肃却显得漫不经心。

"What happened? Is he okay?"
怎么了？他没事吧？

"Well, he got some sort of stomach ache this morning after breakfast," Misato replied, "nothing serious, the doctor said after gastric lavage he'll be back before dinner, albeit he can't have it."
嗯，他今早吃完早餐后肚子疼，" 美里回应道，"没什么大碍，医生说做完洗胃，晚饭前就能回来，只是不能吃晚饭了。

"Sounds like he got 'food' poisoning from whatever shit you made you call food!" Asuka shouted, just putting down the phone, "I seriously wonder how he even survived the first day!"
听起来他像是吃了你做的那堆东西后食物中毒了！"明日香刚放下电话就嚷嚷起来，"我真怀疑他第一天是怎么活下来的！

Misato's face reddened at the accusation as a mountain of undeniable facts were laid in front of her, "c'mon! It was just a little experiment! I wanted to try something new!"
面对这一堆无可辩驳的事实，美里脸红了，辩解道："拜托！这只是个小实验！我想尝试点新花样嘛！"

"Well you should use real lab rats instead of fucking humans!" Asuka barked, "it's explicitly banned by the Geneva Conventions!"
那你应该用真实验室老鼠，而不是拿人来做实验！"明日香怒斥道，"这可是日内瓦公约明令禁止的！

Misato stuck out her tongue to Asuka, who huffed in response, walking into her room. "Shinji, come and help me arrange my stuff!"
美里对明日香做了个鬼脸，后者哼了一声，走进自己的房间。"真嗣，过来帮我整理下东西！"

"Hai." Shinji followed the redhead into her room, to which Misato narrowed her eyes in suspicion. 'Since when is Asuka comfortable enough to let him enter her room?'
"海。" 真嗣跟着红发少女走进她的房间，这让美里眯起了眼睛，心生疑窦。'从什么时候起，明日香变得这么放心让他进自己的房间了？'

One hour later 一小时后

The trio sat around the dining table, having just finished the meal. Asuka wiped her mouth with a tissue before starting, "that was not even half as good as Shinji's cooking," she complimented, eliciting a small blush from the aforementioned boy, "and I'm fully expecting some real German food today. Think you could do that, Shinji?"
三人围坐在餐桌旁，刚吃完饭。明日香用餐巾纸擦了擦嘴，然后开口道："这顿饭连真嗣做的一半好吃都没有，"她称赞道，让那位少年脸上泛起一丝红晕，"我今天可是期待着正宗的德国菜呢。你觉得你能做吗，真嗣？"

"Whoa Asuka, he's not your personal servant you know," Misato gave her a small disapproving glare, "you can't just order him around like that!"
哇，明日香，他又不是你的私人仆人，"美里略带不满地瞪了她一眼，"你不能就这样随便使唤他！

"What, I wasn't ordering him around!" Asuka shot back before turning her head to Shinji, "I asked him. It's up to him if he wants to do it or not! What do you say, Baka?" Although it was technically a choice, her glare had already left him only one choice.
"什么，我哪有使唤他！"明日香反驳道，随即转头看向真嗣，"我只是问问他。做不做由他自己决定！你怎么说，笨蛋？"虽然名义上是选择，但她那锐利的目光已经让他别无选择。

"Right," Shinji sighed internally, "I'll cook some German food tonight," Asuka smirked in triumph. "Actually, I bought some ingredients online," it was another thing in this world which the Children liked, "they'll arrive next Monday. Then I try a recipe I recently acquired."
好吧，" 真嗣暗自叹了口气，"今晚我来做点德国菜，" 明日香得意地笑了。"其实，我已经在网上了买了些食材，" 这是孩子们在这个世界喜欢的另一件事，"下周一就能送到。到时候我试试最近弄到的一个食谱。

"That's great, Shin-chan," Misato gulped down another can of beer, "however you don't need to cook next Monday," both Children raised an eyebrow, "we're going to attend a wedding ceremony that day!"
太好了，真嗣，" 美里又灌下一罐啤酒，"不过你下周一不用做饭了，" 两个孩子都扬起了眉毛，"那天我们要去参加一个婚礼！

"Oh. Whose?" Asuka asked, slumping back to the chair.
"哦，谁的？" 明日香问着，懒洋洋地靠回椅子上。

"Aira-san and Futoshi," Misato replied, "they are Gehirn employees. Kaji and I are invited along with you guys, so yeah."
是爱良小姐和大敏，" 美里回答，"他们是 Gehirn 的员工。我和加持，还有你们俩都受到了邀请，所以就是这样。

"Fine, I suppose…" Asuka grumbled in annoyance, "we need to dress up, right?"
好吧，我想……"明日香不悦地嘟囔着，"我们得打扮一下，对吧？

"Of course, it's a formal circumstance."
当然，这是正式场合。

"Too bad, this Baka doesn't have any formal wear," Asuka sighed, "it seems like we need another shopping trip…"
真糟糕，这个笨蛋没有正装，"明日香叹了口气，"看来我们还得再去购物一次……

"Erm, I'm planning to buy something, anyway," Shinji spoke, to which Asuka looked at him with surprise, "well, that's rich, coming from you." She interrupted.
"呃，我本来就打算买些东西，"真嗣说道，明日香惊讶地看着他，"哼，这话从你嘴里说出来，真是难得。"她打断道。

"Asuka! Let him finish." 明日香！让他把话说完。

"Hai, hai." 是，是。

Shinji swallowed, "well, I'm planning to buy a Cello…"
真嗣咽了咽口水，"嗯，我打算买个大提琴……"

"What?!" Asuka cried in surprise, "you play Cello?"
什么?!" 明日香惊讶地叫道，"你会拉大提琴？

"Yeah, I've been playing it since five," Shinji replied, scratching the back of his head.
"对，我从五岁就开始拉了，" 真嗣回答着，挠了挠后脑勺。

"Damn I'm interested," Asuka said, "you're just full of surprises Shinji."
该死，我真感兴趣，" 明日香说道，"你总是充满惊喜，真嗣。

"My, my, you're interested in what, Asuka?" Misato winked, "the Cello? Or just him?"
哎呀，哎呀，你对什么感兴趣呢，明日香？" 美里眨了眨眼，"是大提琴？还是他？

Asuka blushed a little, "shut it, alright?!" In fact it was a little bit of both, "I played violin when I was young, I think maybe we can play together, like a duet or something," she explained, Shinji smiled in response, "well… I'm looking forward to it," he said, "I know a musical instrument shop downtown, just near the mall, so I'm thinking-"
明日香脸颊微红，"闭嘴，行不行？！" 其实两者都有一点，"我小时候拉过小提琴，我想或许我们可以一起演奏，比如合奏什么的，" 她解释道，真嗣微笑回应，"嗯……我很期待，" 他说，"我知道市中心有一家乐器店，就在商场附近，所以我在想——"

"So it's settled! You're coming with me, Third!" Asuka cut him off with a cheerful cry, "let's not waste more time! Shinji go change! Wait for me at the door, I'll brush my hair."
那就这么定了！你跟我一起去，第三！" 明日香欢快地打断他，"别再浪费时间了！真嗣，去换衣服！在门口等我，我梳下头发。

Misato watched in pleasure as both Children went to do their respective things with smiles on their faces. She felt a deep feeling of satisfaction that her parenting approach finally started to bear fruit.
美里带着愉悦的心情看着两个孩子面带笑容各自忙碌。她感到一种深深的满足感，自己的育儿方式终于开始结出果实。

"I remember this is the place…" Shinji stopped in front of a musical instrument shop, carefully examining the surroundings, "yep, this is the one. Let's get in."
我记得这里就是……" 真嗣停在一家乐器店前，仔细打量四周，"对，就是这儿。我们进去吧。

Asuka grumbled an agreement and followed him inside, and soon was feeling out of place. This was not something unusual; ever since they woke up on the beach, every single of their encounters brought something new and strange into her life. But this was done in private places – such as in the walls of the apartment. This was different. And she brought it upon herself, driven by an impulse she did not really understand.
明日香嘟囔着表示同意，跟着他走了进去，很快便感到格格不入。这并不稀奇；自从他们在海滩上醒来后，每一次遭遇都给她的生活带来了新奇和陌生。但这些都是在私密场所发生的——比如公寓的四壁之内。这次不同。而且这是她自找的，出于一种她自己也不甚明了的一时冲动。

But this time, the context was different. She was not doing mindless, routine shopping out of the list or just buying Misato some beer; this was shopping with someone who was clearly enjoying it – and despite that, paid more attention to her than to the goods. Also, she had to squash a 'like a couple' thought at least twice in the last ten minutes; despite that practice, she was not getting better at it. Shinji's apparent lack of issues with 'accidental' arms brushing when walking side by side did not help.
但这次情况不同。她并非出于清单上的例行公事或仅仅为了给美里买啤酒而进行无脑购物；这次是与一个显然乐在其中的人一起购物——尽管如此，他更关注的是她而非商品。此外，在过去的十分钟里，她至少两次不得不压制住“像情侣一样”的念头；尽管多次练习，她在这方面并未有所长进。真嗣对于并肩行走时“无意间”手臂触碰的明显不在意，更是无济于事。

"I want this one," Asuka said, trying to cover her turmoil.
“我要这个，”明日香说道，试图掩饰内心的纷乱。

"Alright, I've chosen mine as well," Shinji said, picking up the Cello. "Let's go," he headed to the checkout; she followed, still annoyed by the whole situation. The fact that the elderly cashier gave them a knowing smile did not help things, if not making it worse.
“好的，我也选好了，”真嗣说着，拿起大提琴。“走吧，”他朝收银台走去；她跟在后面，仍对整个情况感到恼火。那位年迈的收银员投来的意味深长的微笑非但没有缓解局面，反而让情况更糟。

"Let's hear what the almighty Shinji-sama could do with his Cello, shall we?" Asuka, sitting on the couch, said with half-amusement and half-anticipation.
“让我们听听无所不能的真嗣大人用他的大提琴能演奏出什么来吧，怎么样？”明日香坐在沙发上，半是戏谑半是期待地说道。

"Right." 对。

The sound of music flowed through Misato's apartment as Shinji slid the bow across the strings of his Cello. Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, one of the most famous cello compositions ever made. He had to play it about fifteen beats slower than originally composed though, as his skills weren't exactly anything to boast about. He hadn't played in quite a while.
音乐在美里小姐的公寓中流淌，真嗣滑动着弓，在低音提琴的弦上奏响。巴赫的 G 大调第一号无伴奏大提琴组曲，这是有史以来最著名的大提琴作品之一。尽管如此，他不得不以比原作慢约十五拍的速度演奏，因为他的技艺实在没什么可夸耀的。他已经很久没有演奏了。

He had almost forgotten how much solace and peace it brought him to play, especially after all of the confusing feelings that had been plaguing his mind lately. The music carried him away as the melody flowed through him like a river of sound. It had been quite a while since he had found himself in such a state of ease. He could almost forget about all of the troubles he had been through, all of the hardships he had faced, all of it felt as though it didn't even exist. It was just him, his bow, and his Cello. As he made his final stroke across the strings, he could hear the sound of clapping coming from behind him.
他几乎忘记了演奏给他带来的慰藉与宁静，尤其是在最近困扰他心头的种种纷乱情绪之后。音乐将他带走，旋律如同一道声音的河流穿透他的身心。他已经很久没有感受到如此的轻松状态了。他几乎可以忘记自己经历的所有烦恼，所有的艰难困苦，一切仿佛都不复存在。只有他，他的弓，和他的低音提琴。当他最后一次划过琴弦时，身后传来了掌声。

"Very well, Shinji," Asuka praised, her eyes shining with surprise, "I'm impressed."
非常好，真嗣，"明日香赞许道，眼中闪烁着惊讶的光芒，"我印象深刻。

Shinji blushed at the sincere praise, "I'm glad you like it, Asuka, but I'm not really good at it."
真嗣因这真诚的赞扬而脸红，“你喜欢就好，明日香，但我其实不太擅长。”

"Don't sell yourself short, it's really good," Asuka insisted, "c'mon, it's a compliment from me! You know how rare these things happen." She smirked.
“别小看自己，真的很好，”明日香坚持道，“来吧，这可是我给的夸奖！你知道这有多难得。”她狡黠地笑了笑。

"I suppose you're right," Shinji chuckled.
“我想你说的对，”真嗣轻笑道。

"Of course I'm right," Asuka said, pulling out her violin, "Gah, I've been waiting for a while now. Let's get ready!"
“我当然是对的，”明日香说着，拿出她的提琴，“啊，我已经等了好一会儿了。我们准备开始吧！”

Shinji was more than surprised to see that Asuka wanted to play with him. He couldn't help but smile wider. Pulling out another chair from the table, he invited Asuka to sit beside him, so they could see each other's moves clearly. Asuka sat down and readied her instrument, waiting for Shinji to give the signal.
真嗣看到明日香想和他一起玩，感到非常惊讶。他忍不住笑得更开了。从桌子旁又拉出一把椅子，邀请明日香坐在他旁边，这样他们就能清楚地看到对方的动作。明日香坐下，准备好她的乐器，等待真嗣发出开始的信号。

They looked into each other's eyes for a moment, and nodded simultaneously.
他们彼此对视了一会儿，然后同时点了点头。

Once again music flooded the apartment, and time disappeared for both of them.
音乐再次充满了公寓，时间对他们两人来说仿佛消失了。

After hours of playing, the Children finally pulled to a stop, content smiles on both of their faces. "Y-you played well, Asuka." Shinji complimented, which caused Asuka to blush a little. After all, it was a compliment from someone who was much more proficient in music than her. "What do you expect, Baka-Shinji?" She boasted.
经过数小时的演奏，两位少年终于停了下来，两人脸上都挂着满足的微笑。“你弹得很好，明日香。”真嗣称赞道，这让明日香的脸颊微微泛红。毕竟，这是来自一个比她更擅长音乐的人的赞美。“那还用说，笨蛋真嗣？”她得意地说。

Shinji snickered, "I have a question, though," seeing he got Asuka's attention, he continued, "would you like to…play with me in the future?"
真嗣窃笑道：“我有个问题，”见吸引了明日香的注意，他接着说，“你以后愿意和我一起玩吗？”

Asuka blinked…then started laughing.
明日香眨了眨眼，随即笑了起来。

Shinji was dumbfounded by her reaction, so he decided to use his old strategy, "s-sorry…"
真嗣被她的反应弄得目瞪口呆，于是决定采用老办法，“对、对不起……”

"What are you apologizing for, Baka?" Asuka shot him a glare after calming down from the laughter.
“你道什么歉啊，笨蛋？”明日香笑过之后，瞪了他一眼。

"Erm, did I say something wrong?" Shinji asked nervously.
"呃，我说错什么了吗？" 真嗣紧张地问道。

"Absolutely nothing was wrong," Asuka reassured him, wiping tears off her eyes, "gott…Shinji, you're just…impossible," she breathed out the air, "anyway, the answer is 'yes, I'd love to!' Satisfied?"
一点都没错，" 明日香安慰他，擦去眼角的泪水，"天哪…真嗣，你真是…让人无语，" 她长出一口气，"总之，答案是'是的，我很愿意！' 满意了吗？

Shinji's worried expression turned into a grin in a blink of an eye, "right."
真嗣担忧的表情瞬间转为笑容，"好的。"

"Okay, we'll talk about what we want to play next, and practice together…"
那好，我们来讨论下接下来想玩什么，然后一起练习…

Shinji kept smiling as Asuka drowned on about her plans of the duets with him. Their lives were certainly getting better and better.
真嗣一直微笑着，听着明日香滔滔不绝地讲述她和他二重唱的计划。他们的生活确实越来越美好了。

Next Monday, Wedding Ceremony
下周一，婚礼仪式

"Gods you're hopeless," Asuka complained as she once again adjusted Shinji's tilted tie, but not without a smile, "how are you supposed to even live without me wiping your ass?"
天啊，你真是无可救药，"明日香一边抱怨，一边再次调整真嗣歪斜的领带，脸上却带着笑意，"没有我帮你擦屁股，你可怎么活啊？

Shinji's face flushed in embarrassment, "Asuka… I'm not, very, erm, social, as you can see," he said, to which Asuka chuckled, "I mean, I've never had anyone close before, so I really suck at social etiquettes."
真嗣的脸因尴尬而泛红，"明日香……我，呃，不太擅长社交，你看，"他说道，明日香听后轻笑一声，"我是说，我以前从没有亲近的人，所以在社交礼仪方面真的很差劲。"

"Well, appreciate your good fortune, you have the gorgeous Asuka as your teacher," Asuka boasted, "now just a little tighter…great! Just perfect."
哎呀，珍惜你的好运吧，你有美丽的明日香当老师，"明日香自夸道，"现在再稍微紧一点…太好了！完美极了。

Shinji wore a standard black suit and trousers and a light-blue shirt, with a tie that had red and purple stripes on it. The whole outfit was moderate, but it fitted his appearance just well. His cobalt eyes complemented with the tie exceptionally. Asuka grinned as she took a whole look at her work – a dressed-up Shinji definitely looked much more mature.
真嗣穿着标准的黑色西装和长裤，搭配一件浅蓝色衬衫，领带上有红色和紫色的条纹。整体装扮中规中矩，却恰好衬托出他的气质。他那钴蓝色的眼睛与领带相得益彰。明日香满意地打量着自己的杰作——打扮一番的真嗣显然看起来成熟多了。

'So who gives a fuck even if you're not perfect in every way?' Asuka thought as she beheld the sight in front of her eyes, 'I'll make you perfect.'
'就算你在各方面都不完美又怎样？谁在乎啊？' 明日香望着眼前的景象心想，'我会让你变得完美。'

As for Asuka herself, she wore a pair of heels that perfectly matched the color of the dress, boosting her height to exactly match Shinji's, the fact that he dismissed having any possibility of sheer coincidence. Her dress reached to her ankles and…her dress…
至于明日香自己，她穿了一双与裙子颜色完美搭配的高跟鞋，使她的身高恰好与真嗣持平，而他却认为这绝非偶然。她的裙子长及脚踝，而…她的裙子…

It started with an embroidered strip that wrapped around her elegant neck, crossing just under her throat, thickening to a modest width halfway down each of her breasts to create a thin triangular-shaped gap in the precise center of her chest, as the embroidered pattern gave way to pure, smooth, silk that resonated in the sunset. The bottom of the dress covered her thigh and ankle, but not leaving little room for imagination.
一切始于一条环绕她优雅颈项的刺绣带，恰好在喉咙下方交叉，至双乳中段略微加宽，于胸前正中形成一个细长三角形的空隙，刺绣图案在此过渡为纯粹、光滑的丝绸，在夕阳下熠熠生辉。裙摆覆盖至大腿和脚踝，却又不失遐想空间。

Above the stunning, adult dress however – which was more than potent enough to blow his mind away - was her face.
然而，在那件足以令他心神荡漾的成人礼服之上，是她的面容。

Although Asuka only wore light makeup that day, it did nothing to hinder her beauty. Her fiery red hair fell down almost to her waist level like a waterfall, two red hair clips resting on her head. Lightly applied mascara framed her sapphire eyes, which danced with emotions Shinji could not name, her lips forming a tiny smile, but whether it was because she was happy to see him, pleased with his presentation, or just delighted that she had blown his mind somewhere into the ionosphere, he didn't have a clue.
尽管那日明日香仅化了淡妆，却丝毫不减其美貌。她那火红的长发如瀑布般垂至腰际，头顶别着两个红色发夹。轻扫的睫毛膏勾勒出她那双蓝宝石般的眼睛，眼中闪烁着真嗣无法名状的情感，唇边挂着微小的笑意，不知是因为见到他而欢喜，还是对他的表现感到满意，亦或是单纯因将他的思绪吹至电离层而得意，他无从知晓。

In short, she was more ready for a date than a wedding ceremony.
简而言之，她更像是为约会而非婚礼仪式做好了准备。

"Ladies and Gentlemen, let's welcome our newlyweds –Himari Aira and Ichiro Futoshi!" With a round of applause, the happy bride and bridegroom walked to the stage on the red carpet. Misato and Kaji were in a far corner, not really interested in the event; they just came here out of courtesy.
"女士们先生们，让我们欢迎新婚夫妇——Himari Aira 和 Ichiro Futoshi！"在一阵掌声中，幸福的新郎新娘踏着红毯走向舞台。Misato 和 Kaji 站在远处角落，对这场婚礼并不太感兴趣；他们只是出于礼节才来到这里。

Shinji and Asuka chatted about their future duet plans as the couple did their usual wedding traditions. "Now let's welcome our bridesmaid –Yui Ikari - to give her speech!"
当这对新人进行着常规的婚礼仪式时，Shinji 和 Asuka 正讨论着他们未来二重唱的计划。"现在有请我们的伴娘——Yui Ikari——上台致辞！"

Shinji and Asuka blinked. A series of emotions went through Shinji's face: confusion, surprise, fear – he reluctantly looked toward the stage, and instinctively blurted out, "Ayanami?" He narrowed his eyes, his heart pounding at 120 beats per minute. "No, it's…mother…" His knees started to go wobble.
Shinji 和 Asuka 愣住了。Shinji 脸上闪过一系列情绪：困惑、惊讶、恐惧——他勉强望向舞台，本能地脱口而出："Ayanami？"他眯起眼睛，心跳加速至每分钟 120 次。"不，那是……母亲……"他的膝盖开始发软。

Asuka observed his reactions and acted instantly –she caught him just in time and put him on a chair. Shinji was hyperventilating, eyes widen as his brain failed to process the information and emotions.
Asuka 观察到他的反应，立刻行动——她及时扶住他，让他坐到椅子上。Shinji 呼吸急促，眼睛瞪大，大脑无法处理这突如其来的信息和情感。

"Shinji, look at me," he slowly turned his head to the redhead, "she's not your mother – just like the Commander is not your father. They are Rei Ikari's parents." Seeing no obvious effect, she tried again, "c'mon, repeat after me: the woman on the stage, the bridesmaid, is not my mother."
真嗣，看着我，"他缓缓转头望向那位红发女子，"她不是你母亲——就像司令不是你父亲一样。他们是绫波丽的父母。"见他反应不大，她又试了一次，"来，跟我重复：台上那位伴娘，不是我母亲。

Shinji nodded slowly and took a deep breath, "the woman on the stage, the bridesmaid, is not my mother." He started to calm down.
真嗣缓缓点头，深吸一口气，"台上那位伴娘，不是我母亲。"他开始平静下来。

"Breathe, Shinji, breathe," he complied. "Good," Asuka said, looking around the room, "are you feeling okay? Do you want to go home early?"
呼吸，真嗣，呼吸，"他照做了。"很好，"明日香环顾四周说道，"你感觉还好吗？想不想早点回家？

Shinji nodded, "ye-yeah," he answered weakly, tears threatening to come out of the corner of his eyes, "l-let's go home." He gradually stood up with Asuka's help, walking together with the redhead to where Misato and Kaji were.
真嗣点头，"嗯...嗯，"他虚弱地回答，眼角泪光闪烁，"我们...我们回家吧。"在明日香的帮助下，他慢慢站起身，与红发少女一同走向正在等待的美里和加持。

"This Baka needs to go home, I think he had a panic attack," Asuka executed her technically true statement, "I'll go to the bathroom, I'll be right back!"
这家伙得回家了，我看他是恐慌发作了，" 明日香执行了她那技术上真实的陈述，"我去趟洗手间，马上回来！

She took off and headed to the restroom hurriedly, not wanting to have Shinji wait any longer. Five minutes later she rushed out of the bathroom, jogging back to Shinji's side.
她匆匆离开，急忙前往洗手间，不想让真嗣再等。五分钟后，她从洗手间冲出来，小跑着回到真嗣身边。

Then the universe decided to play a trick on her.
这时，宇宙似乎决定跟她开个玩笑。

"Hello, young lady?" A familiar, yet terrifying voice that had been taunting her in her nightmares came to her, freezing Asuka on the spot like a deer caught in the headlights. "Do you know where the bathroom is? I couldn't find it, and I saw water on your hands…"
你好，小姑娘？" 一个熟悉而可怕的声音在她耳边响起，那是她噩梦中不断纠缠她的声音，让明日香当场僵住，如同被车灯照到的鹿。"你知道洗手间在哪儿吗？我找不到，而且看到你手上沾了水……

Asuka raised her head, her eyes widened in fear; it looked like she's just seen a ghost.
明日香抬起头，眼中满是惊恐，仿佛刚见了鬼一般。

Asuka dear, die with me…
亲爱的明日香，和我一起死吧…

"Are you okay, young lady? You look…pale," Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu asked with a concerned look, a look Asuka had missed so much-
“小姐，你还好吗？你看起来…脸色苍白，”绫波丽·齐柏林·索西鲁关切地问道，那神情是明日香久违的思念。

Who are you? 你是谁？

"Momma?" Asuka shivered violently hearing the voice. Another girl at her age emerged, she also had blue eyes, but her hair was short and reddish-brown. "You still haven't found out where the bathroom is?"
妈妈？"听到这个声音，明日香猛地一颤。另一个与她年纪相仿的女孩出现了，她也有着蓝色的眼睛，但头发是短的，呈赤褐色。"你还没找到洗手间在哪儿吗？

Kyoko turned her attention to Mana Langley Soryu, a smile appearing on her face –the same smile she used when talking to the doll-
京子将注意力转向了真名·兰利·索耶，脸上浮现出微笑——正是她与玩偶交谈时所用的那种微笑。

Asuka…my dear… 明日香…我亲爱的…

Asuka watched Mana and Kyoko talked to each other, both of them smiling lovingly.
明日香看着真名和京子相互交谈，两人都面带爱意地微笑着。

The hospital. The doll. The smile.
医院。玩偶。微笑。

She was unable to move, unable to think.
她动弹不得，思绪也停滞了。

Mana said something to which Kyoko laughed slightly before they both walked away, leaving a transfixed Asuka at the spot.
真名对京子说了些什么，京子轻笑一声后两人一同离去，留下呆立原地的明日香。

"Asuka? Where are- Oh, here you are," Shinji's concerned voice sounded. He quickly ran to her and looked at her with a worried expression, "what happened? Are you okay?" He grabbed her hand, hoping this small gesture of support could help her in some way.
"明日香？你在哪儿——哦，你在这儿。" 真嗣关切的声音响起。他快步跑到她身边，面露忧色地看着她，"发生了什么？你还好吗？" 他握住她的手，希望通过这个小小的支持举动能给她一些帮助。

Asuka snapped out of the state, her brain started reacting again after a complete meltdown. She returned the handholding with a death grip, "l-let's go home, Shinji." She said in a whisper.
明日香猛然回过神来，大脑在彻底崩溃后重新开始运转。她用力回握住手，仿佛要将其捏碎，低声说道：“我…我们回家吧，真嗣。”

XXXXXX

On the way home, neither Children spoke to each other, much less their guardians. Both of them mused about what happened that day. Asuka was shivering slightly the entire way, much to Shinji's concern.
回家的路上，两位少年彼此间没有交谈，更别提与监护人的对话了。两人都在默默思索着那天发生的事情。明日香一路上微微颤抖，让真嗣颇为担忧。

As soon as they got home Asuka immediately ran into her room and shut off the door. The booming sound of a bedroom door slamming shut echoed throughout the apartment. Shinji sighed and lowered his head.
一进家门，明日香便立刻冲进自己的房间，砰地一声关上了门。卧室门重重关闭的声响在公寓内回荡。真嗣叹了口气，垂下了头。

Letting out a sigh, Shinji rose from his feet and trudged towards the hallway, making his way to Asuka's room.
真嗣叹息一声，从座位上站起身，拖着沉重的步伐走向走廊，朝明日香的房间走去。

"Asuka, are you alright?" He knocked on the door, asking.
"明日香，你还好吗？" 他敲着门，问道。

"Go away!" Asuka snarled through the door.
"走开！" 明日香隔着门咆哮道。

"Asuka," Shinji sighed. "please open the door?"
明日香，" 真嗣叹了口气。"请开开门好吗？

"I said get lost!" 我说了滚开！

"Please, Asuka?" 求你了，明日香？

"What are you, stupid? I said fuck off!"
你傻吗？我说滚开！

Shinji let his head fall limp and his forehead thudded against the door where it remained while he looked down at his feet. He really didn't want to leave her like this. Between this and the mini-episode she had back in the wedding ceremony, he knew that Asuka was probably on the brink of possibly relapsing into her former state of hating everything.
真嗣垂下头，额头无力地撞在门上，就这样贴着门，目光落在自己的脚上。他真的不想就这样离开她。从婚礼上的小插曲到现在，他知道明日香可能正处在重新陷入憎恨一切的旧态的边缘。

After standing there in silence for what felt like close to a minute, Shinji could hear the German girl's voice come through the door once again. "You're not leaving, are you?"
在沉默中站了将近一分钟，真嗣再次听到门后传来那位德国女孩的声音："你不会走的，对吧？"

"No." He answered with little enthusiasm in his tone. Through the door, he could hear her snicker. "Of course you aren't." Asuka took in a deep breath and exhaled. "Shinji, if it'll make you feel any better, we can talk about this tomorrow, okay? I just… I just really don't want to talk to anyone right now."
不。" 他回答时语气中几乎没有热情。透过门，他能听到她的窃笑。"当然不是。" 明日香深吸了一口气，然后缓缓呼出。"真嗣，如果这样能让你好受些，我们可以明天再谈这件事，好吗？我只是……我现在真的不想和任何人说话。

The brown-haired teen felt that he had no choice but to accept her offer. She wasn't going to open the door for anything, and pushing the subject at this point would probably just make her not want to talk about it at all. Reluctantly, Shinji was forced to agree. "Alright." He spoke. "We can talk about it tomorrow, then."
棕色头发的少年感到自己别无选择，只能接受她的提议。她不会为任何事开门，而此时继续追问可能只会让她完全不想谈论这件事。无奈之下，真嗣被迫同意了。"好吧。" 他说道，"那我们明天再谈。"

"Thank you, Shinji." Asuka's voice came back as little more than a whisper. "I really appreciate it." Cracking a faint grin, Shinji turned around and leaned his back against the door, sliding down it until he was sitting on the floor. Even though he knew that there was no way he could get through to her tonight, he still had to get the point across that he was going to keep the promise he made to her. "But I'm not leaving." He turned his head towards the door to ensure that his voice would make it into her room. At first there was no reply, but after a few seconds of silence between the two, Asuka finally responded.
"谢谢你，真嗣。"明日香的声音几乎细不可闻。"真的很感激。"真嗣微微一笑，转身背靠门板，缓缓滑坐到地板上。尽管他清楚今晚无法真正触及她的心，但他仍需让她明白，自己会坚守对她的承诺。"但我不会离开。"他侧头对着门，确保声音能传入她的房间。起初没有回应，几秒的沉默后，明日香终于开口。

"I know." 我知道。

### Chapter 9: Goodbye, Mothers Pt2
再见，母亲们 第二部分

Misato Katsuragi rubbed her eyes, walking into the apartment – and then heard a loud BANG of door sliding shut. Sighing, she took off the shoes then entered the living room, scanning for the source of the noise.
葛城美里揉了揉眼睛，走进公寓——随即听到一声响亮的门滑动关闭的“砰”声。她叹了口气，脱下鞋子，然后走进客厅，寻找噪音的来源。

Misato frowned as she saw Shinji sitting on the floor, his back leaned against Asuka's bedroom door. "Hey, Shin-chan, what happened?" She asked; the said boy raised his head and sighed, "Asuka… she's, erm, not in the best shape right now."
美里看到真嗣坐在地上，背靠着明日香的卧室门，不禁皱起了眉头。“嘿，真嗣，发生了什么事？”她问道；那个男孩抬起头，叹了口气，“明日香……她现在，呃，状态不太好。”

"She's throwing a tantrum?" Misato's frown subsided a little, "it's quite common, just give her time. She'll calm down." She chuckled. During the days she and Asuka lived together, one of the hardships Misato had to endure was the redhead's temper. She had been mellowing – a lot - in recent days, and – thanks to her special perceptiveness - she had a solid guess of the reason – the boy currently sitting on the floor.
“她在发脾气吗？”美里的眉头稍微舒展了一些，“这很常见，给她点时间。她会冷静下来的。”她轻笑道。在与明日香同住的日子里，美里不得不忍受的诸多困难之一便是这位红发少女的脾气。最近她已经温和了许多——很大程度上——而且——多亏了她特有的洞察力——她对原因有了一个坚定的猜测——正是此刻坐在地板上的那个男孩。

Which meant he was probably also the reason for her tantrum right now. "Shinji, did you do something…to upset her?" She said in almost a whisper, not wanting Asuka to hear their conversation.
这意味着他很可能也是她此刻发脾气的缘由。"真嗣，你是不是做了什么……惹她不高兴了？" 她几乎是用耳语说道，不想让明日香听到他们的对话。

"No…" Shinji simply said.
"没有……" 真嗣简单地回答。

"But what are you doing here?" Misato pushed, "to me, this looks like you guys had a fight, a big one, and you're here to-"
那你在这里做什么？" 美里追问道，"在我看来，你们俩像是大吵了一架，而你来这里是为了——

"Misato!" Shinji shouted in a whisper, cutting her off. He stood up and gestured Misato to come to the living room so they could have a decent conversation, "I really have no idea why she's like this! She was okay before she went to the bathroom, and she took too long to come back, so I went to find her. When I found her she just stood there, face pale! And you know the rest," Shinji hastily recapitulate the situation, eliciting another confused frown from Misato.
"美里！" 真嗣低声喊道，打断了她。他站起来，示意美里跟他到客厅去，以便能好好交谈，"我真的不知道她为什么会这样！她去洗手间之前还好好的，但回来得太慢了，我就去找她。找到她时，她就站在那里，脸色苍白！然后的事情你也知道了，" 真嗣急忙概述了情况，引得美里又是一脸困惑。

"Hmm," she rubbed her chin, "yourself is okay, right? Asuka said you had a panic attack," she asked with concern.
"嗯，" 她摩挲着下巴，"你自己还好吧？明日香说你刚才恐慌发作了，" 她关切地问道。

"I'm…fine." 我…没事。

"Alright," Misato went for the fridge, "what are you doing here, anyway?" She took out a beer, came back in strides, and sat down on the chair.
"好吧，" 美里走向冰箱，"那你来这儿干嘛？" 她拿出一罐啤酒，大步流星地走回来，坐在椅子上。

"I'm just here to make sure she's okay," Shinji replied.
"我只是来看看她是否安好，" 真嗣回答道。

Misato winked knowingly, Shinji groaned as he knew what's going to happen next, "oh my, Shin-chan you're so sweet," she teased, "she's gonna appreciate this, ya know. By the way, you two seem really close…is there anything going on between you two?" A smug grin appeared on her face.
美里眨了眨眼，一副心知肚明的样子，真嗣呻吟一声，预感到接下来会发生什么，“哎呀，小真你真是太贴心了，”她打趣道，“她肯定会喜欢的，你知道的。对了，你们俩看起来真的很亲密呢……是不是有什么情况？”她脸上露出了得意的笑容。

Shinji's cheeks began heating up, "well, we work and live together, so we inevitably are…close, right? Not that kind of close!" He hastily corrected after he saw Misato's raised eyebrow, "we're good friends, that's all!"
真嗣的脸颊开始发热，“呃，我们工作和生活都在一起，所以自然而然就……亲近了，对吧？不是那种亲近！”他急忙纠正，因为看到了美里挑起的眉毛，“我们只是好朋友，仅此而已！”

"Hmm, but I'm sure you're interested, I mean, she's really pretty and has a good figure," Misato's sly smile grew wider, "I've seen her only wrapped around a towel, ya know." She winked.
“嗯，但我敢肯定你对她有兴趣，我是说，她真的很漂亮，身材也好，”美里的狡黠笑容更甚，“我见过她只裹着一条毛巾的样子，你知道的。”她又眨了眨眼。

Shinji's blush deepened as his brains unhelpfully visualized the scene, and the surfacing of memories of that night in the hotel did not help things, if not worsening it. "Misato…do you think this is appropriate?"
真嗣的脸红得更厉害了，脑海中不自觉地浮现出那幅画面，再加上酒店那一夜的记忆涌上心头，情况非但没有好转，反而更糟了。“美里……你觉得这样合适吗？”

"Gah, you kids are no fun," Misato huffed, throwing the empty can into the trash can through an uncalculated yet perfect parabola.
"哎，你们这些孩子真没劲，" 葛城美里嘟囔着，随手将空罐子扔进垃圾桶，划出一道未经计算却完美无缺的抛物线。

"Where's Kaji, anyway?" Shinji sighed, deciding to change the subject, "didn't he come back with us?"
话说，加持先生去哪儿了？" 碇真嗣叹了口气，决定换个话题，"他不是跟我们一起回来的吗？

"He said he had some business to attend to," Misato answered, gulping down her can of beer, "he should be back before dinner, though."
他说有点事要处理，" 葛城美里回答道，大口喝着啤酒，"不过晚饭前应该能回来。

Meanwhile Inside the Geofront
与此同时，在第三新东京市地下的 Geofront 内部

Kaji Ryoji took out his terminal and connected it to MAGI through the staff access port. He ran some codes he prepared in advance – several minutes later, Gigabytes of information was downloaded into his laptop.
加持良治取出自己的终端，通过员工接入端口连接到 MAGI 系统。他运行了事先准备好的几段代码——几分钟后，数吉字节的信息被下载到了他的笔记本电脑中。

"Hmm…interesting," he murmured to himself, closing the laptop and erased every trace of his misdeeds. He couldn't get any more information since it risked a lot, and his inaccessibility to better equipment also made it impossible.
"嗯……有意思，"他自言自语道，合上笔记本电脑并抹去了所有违规操作的痕迹。由于风险太大，他无法获取更多信息，加之缺乏更好的设备，这更是不可能。

Nevertheless, what he got was enough to cost him days, if not weeks, to digest.
尽管如此，他所得到的信息足以让他花费数日，甚至数周来消化。

Katsuragi Residence 葛城家

"Shin-chan, what smells so good?" Came Misato's cheerful voice as she walked into the kitchen, her eyes focused on the stove, trying to eliminate her impatient mood by taking a look at today's dinner.
"新之助，什么东西这么香啊？" 美里欢快的声音传来，她走进厨房，目光紧盯着炉灶，试图通过看看今天的晚餐来消除自己的急躁情绪。

"Since we came back early, I reckon to try the German recipe I mentioned last week," Shinji replied, still focused on the stove, "the ingredients are here, anyway,"
既然我们回来得早，我想试试上周提到的那个德国菜谱，" 真嗣回答道，目光依旧集中在炉灶上，"反正材料都有，

"I'm sure this will improve Asuka's mood, however it deteriorated," Misato walked closer, leaning forward, trying to identify the food.
"我相信这会让明日香的心情好起来，不管她怎么变糟了，" 美里走近了些，身体前倾，试图辨认出是什么食物。

"I hope so…" Shinji sighed. He also needed cooking to take his mind off things – specifically the appearance of his mother.
"希望如此吧…" 真嗣叹了口气。他也需要烹饪来转移注意力——特别是关于他母亲的突然出现。

"Wow, you're making Käsespätzle?" Misato's eyes gleamed with surprise, "like what Asuka said, you're really full of surprises Shinji."
哇，你在做奶酪意面？" 美里惊讶地眼睛一亮，"就像明日香说的，你真是让人惊喜连连啊，真嗣。

"T-thanks, Misato-san," Shinji was flattered, "I can only hope I won't screw it up today, considering it's my first time making it, and Asuka certainly needs a wonderful dinner." He said, speeding up his work at hand.
"谢、谢谢，美里小姐，" 真嗣有些受宠若惊，"我只希望今天不要搞砸了，毕竟是第一次做，而且明日香确实需要一顿美味的晚餐。" 他说着，加快了手头的工作。

"Don't sell yourself short, your cooking's been great," Misato sighed in remorse, "ya know, if I'm at your age I'd probably want you to be my boyfriend." Another smug grin appeared on her face.
"别小看自己，你做的菜一直都很棒，" 美里带着一丝悔意叹息道，"你知道吗，如果我在你这个年纪，可能会希望你做我的男朋友呢。" 她脸上又浮现出一抹得意的笑容。

Shinji's blush turned incandescent, "Mi-Misato-san, y-you're joking, right?"
真嗣的脸红得发烫，"美、美里小姐，你、你是在开玩笑吧？"

"Hahaha, rest assured, I'm not gonna fight with Asuka," Misato turned away from the kitchen, "just make sure you'll chase her if she ever runs," she left the kitchen, her voice trailing off.
"哈哈哈，放心吧，我不会和明日香打架的，" 美里从厨房转过身来，"只是要确保如果她跑了你会去追她，" 她离开厨房，声音渐渐远去。

Shinji smiled an invisible smile, 'you're right, Misato-san. I will.'
真嗣露出了一个看不见的微笑，'你说得对，美里小姐。我会的。'

"Dinner's ready!" Shinji's loud voice came through the tightly closed door, reaching Asuka's ear. She lifted her head from the pillow – which was surprisingly dry – her eyes red, hair messy. She was tempted to not come out and brood all evening and all night – however, her growling stomach said otherwise. Not to mention the smell of the food-
"晚饭好了！" 真嗣响亮的声音穿透紧闭的门，传到了明日香的耳中。她从枕头上抬起头来——出奇地干燥——眼睛红红的，头发凌乱。她本想不出来，整晚整夜地闷闷不乐——然而，她咕咕叫的肚子却有不同的意见。更别提那食物的香味了——

"What did that Baka make today? Smells so nice," Asuka sniffed the air before slumping back down, "humph…momma…" she chuckled as she realized what a hypocrite she was, "I snapped him out of his panic attack and now I'm here all moping by myself." Shaking her head, she got up from bed and walked to the bedroom door.
"那个笨蛋今天做了什么？闻起来真香，" 明日香嗅了嗅空气，然后又颓然躺下，"哼……妈妈……" 她自嘲地笑了笑，意识到自己多么虚伪，"我把他从恐慌中拉了出来，现在我却在这里独自闷闷不乐。" 她摇了摇头，从床上起来，走向卧室门。

Opening the door was easy, stepping out of the room was also easy; looking at her roommates and starting interactions was difficult on another level. Asuka kept her face down and wandered to the table like a zombie, sitting down without saying a word.
开门容易，走出房间也容易；但面对室友们，开始交流却难上加难。明日香低着头，像僵尸一样游荡到桌边，坐下后一言不发。

Shinji shot her a worried look, but unnoticed by the redhead who kept her gaze on a particular decorative pattern on the table. Misato also looked at her with concern but decided to keep her mouth shut since it was not a good time to bring it up.
真嗣向她投去担忧的目光，但红发少女并未察觉，她的视线始终停留在桌面上某个特定的装饰图案上。美里也关切地看着她，但决定保持沉默，因为此时提起并不合适。

Shinji carried the plates of Käsespätzle to the table, putting them down lightly. The moment Asuka saw the content of the plates, her eyes sparkled, her face instantly lit up, beaming with surprise, "Käsespätzle? Hm, there's hope for you, after all," 'you surely know how to make me happy,' a treacherous voice in her mind sounded. She took a spoonful, the heavenly taste of the food bloomed on her taste buds, "not half-bad, I'll give it a pass," 'I'll marry you if you keep doing this,' the voice continued, Asuka didn't even try to squash the thought this time.
真嗣端着几盘奶酪面疙瘩走向餐桌，轻轻放下。明日香一看到盘中的食物，眼睛顿时亮了起来，脸上立刻绽放出惊喜的笑容，“奶酪面疙瘩？嗯，看来你还有救，”一个狡猾的声音在她脑海中响起，“你确实知道如何让我开心。”她舀起一勺，那美妙的味道在味蕾上绽放，“还不错，算你过关，”那个声音继续说道，“你要是能一直这样，我就嫁给你。”这次，明日香甚至没有试图压制这个念头。

Shinji wasn't sure what to make out of Asuka's remarks. On one hand, he was expecting a little more than that – maybe a 'thank you' was enough. On the other hand, he could see how she really felt from her beaming expression – not to mention he knew that usually Asuka didn't mean what she said. So he simply chose to respond with a panacea reply – a smile.
真嗣对明日香的这番话感到有些摸不着头脑。一方面，他本期待着更多——或许一句“谢谢”就足够了。另一方面，从她灿烂的笑容中，他能感受到她真实的情感——更不用说，他知道明日香通常言不由衷。因此，他选择了一个万全的回应——一个微笑。

Asuka found herself unable to hold back her own smile.
明日香发现自己忍不住也露出了笑容。

Later that night 当晚深夜

Asuka's eyes shot open in the darkness of her room; the darkness that was full of shapes. She felt as if the veil of the dream was not entirely lifted yet; her heart was pounding, and she was cold. All this was normal; those were the sensations she always had when awakening from a nightmare. But this was the first nightmare in the last week – she hadn't had one ever since that night in Okinawa. She began to forget how they felt.
在房间的黑暗中，明日香猛地睁开了眼睛；那黑暗中充满了各种形状。她感觉梦的帷幕尚未完全揭开；心跳如鼓，浑身冰冷。这一切都很正常；每当从噩梦中醒来，她总是有这样的感觉。但这是过去一周以来的第一个噩梦——自从那晚在冲绳之后，她就再也没有做过噩梦。她开始忘记那种感觉。

'Fuck. And I was so fine…' she thought bitterly. She breathed deeply for a long while, calming her heart down. She groaned in frustration as none of the tricks she used to calm down worked. 'The medicine is just behind two walls,' a treacherous part of her mind was whispering to her. 'Go to him. You don't need to be alone.' She growled. "How am I supposed to go to his room? It's not like I can just climb over the balcony! He trusted me not to do it! I promised! Breaking that trust will end badly." She shook her head.
'该死。我本来好好的…'她苦涩地想。她深呼吸了许久，试图平复心跳。但无论尝试何种方法，都无法缓解内心的烦躁，她不禁懊恼地呻吟。'药就在两堵墙后面，'她脑海中一个狡猾的声音低语着，'去找他吧。你不必独自承受。'她低吼一声。"我怎么可能去他的房间？又不能直接翻阳台过去！他信任我不会这么做！我承诺过的！破坏这份信任后果不堪设想。"她摇了摇头。

Another thought was forming, scratching insistently at her will. 'You can go to his room in a normal way. Your guardians are all sound asleep. Misato got five cans of beer down in her stomach and Kaji was always a heavy sleeper, at least the Kaji you knew.' Asuka drove her nails into the mattress. The resurfacing memory of the doll and things that could resurface from her head made her shiver. 'Fuck that,' she hit the mattress with her fist. 'Fuck it all. What do I have to lose? I'll come back before anyone wakes up and everything will be good.'
另一个念头正在形成，固执地挑战着她的意志。'你可以正常地去他房间。你的监护人都睡得正香。美里喝了五罐啤酒，而加持，至少是你认识的那个加持，一向睡得很沉。'明日香用力抓着床垫。脑海中浮现的玩偶记忆，以及可能随之涌现的种种，让她不寒而栗。'去他的，'她一拳砸在床垫上，'全都去他的。我还有什么可失去的？我会在任何人醒来之前回来，一切都会好起来的。'

Asuka sprang out of bed, slid her door open, and tiptoed around the apartment. Own door closed –check. Misato is sleeping – check. She walked to the apartment door and pressed the open button. The door hissed open – the sound was a little too loud contrasted by the silence of the night – Asuka jumped a little but soon composed herself as she made sure no one noticed anything. It was good that every other resident was driven away from the apartment building.
明日香从床上跳起，拉开房门，蹑手蹑脚地在公寓里走动。自己的门关好了——确认。美里在睡觉——确认。她走向公寓大门，按下开启按钮。门嘶嘶作响地打开——这声音在夜的寂静中显得有些刺耳——明日香吓了一跳，但很快镇定下来，确保没人注意到任何异常。幸好其他住户都已离开这栋公寓楼。

She walked to the door next to the one she just came out from and took out the spare keycard Shinji gave her, and slid it through the slot on the lock. The door opened with a hiss no less loud than the previous one, but she paid no mind as a cold gust wind blew past her, making her shiver; she quickly stepped into the apartment and slid the door shut.
她走到刚出来的那扇门旁边的另一扇门前，掏出真嗣给她的备用门卡，插入锁槽。门同样嘶嘶作响地打开，声音不亚于之前那扇，但她毫不在意，因为一阵冷风掠过，让她打了个寒颤；她迅速步入公寓，将门滑上。

Asuka checked put her ear on the door of Kaji's bedroom. Steady breathing could be heard. She sighed in relief and walked to Shinji's room, and knocked lightly.
明日香将耳朵贴在加持卧室的门上。平稳的呼吸声传来。她松了口气，走向真嗣的房间，轻敲了几下。

Shinji responds to knocking – wait for it… A sleepy "Yes?" sounded in response, followed by a "Come in?" She slid into his room and quickly dropped on her knees next to his bed.
真嗣回应敲门声——等待中……一个睡意朦胧的“什么事？”响起，紧接着是“进来吧？”她滑进他的房间，迅速跪坐在他的床边。

Shinji was looking at her with half-open eyes. "Asuka?!" He said in surprise, "what are you doing here? Are you…alright?"
真嗣半睁着眼看着她。“明日香？！”他惊讶地说，“你怎么在这里？你…还好吗？”

"I'm… fine", she lied. "Or not," she corrected herself. "Listen, Shinji. I...had a nightmare. I want some company. We don't need to talk, we'll do that tomorrow. I promised, didn't I?" she kept going.
“我…没事”，她撒了个谎。“或者说，不是很好，”她纠正自己。“听着，真嗣。我…做了个噩梦。我想要有人陪。我们不需要说话，明天再说吧。我答应过的，不是吗？”她继续说道。

"Asuka… just… come," his voice was quite sleepy. "Just… lie down", he added, disentangling his hand from the sheets and touching hers.
“明日香…就…过来吧，”他的声音听起来很困倦。“就…躺下吧”，他补充道，从床单中抽出手来触碰她的手。

"You sure?" she double-checked warily.
“你确定吗？”她小心翼翼地再次确认。

"Asuka," his voice gained a tinge of annoyance, audible even through the sleepy haze. "I just had a nightmare, and I really want to sleep right now," he grumbled in a still-absent voice, grabbing her wrist firmly. "I suppose you came here for the same reason? I'm glad you came…"
明日香，" 他的声音中带着一丝不悦，即便在睡意朦胧中也能听得出来。"我刚做了个噩梦，现在真的很想睡觉，" 他用一种还未完全清醒的声音抱怨着，紧紧抓住她的手腕。"我想你来这里也是因为这个原因吧？我很高兴你来了……

Asuka blinked at Shinji's uncharacteristic behavior and language; she shook it off, 'Well, either way… you invited me, you're stuck with me.' She slid down under the warm sheets; a moment later she was locked in a strong embrace; his skin felt hot against her own, even through the two layers of fabric. Asuka tensed up, "Shinji, I don't remember saying you could hug me," but she made no resistance whatsoever.
明日香对真嗣不同寻常的行为和言语眨了眨眼，随即抛之脑后，'反正，是你邀请我的，你就得负责到底。' 她滑进温暖的被窝；片刻后，她被一个有力的拥抱紧紧环绕；尽管隔着两层布料，他的皮肤依然感觉滚烫。明日香身体一紧，"真嗣，我没记得允许你抱我，" 但她丝毫没有抗拒。

"You're cold. Let me warm you," came an increasingly sleepy voice from Shinji. The last words were slurred; she could not be sure if he was really awake at that point. Something stirred in her stomach and her heart fluttered. 'Why is he like this? How do I deserve it? And what if he decides I'm too much trouble and leaves?' she shivered. His breath was steady and his grasp firm; that was slowly calming her.
"你很冷。让我给你暖暖，" 真嗣的声音越来越困倦。最后几个字含糊不清；她不确定他那时是否真的醒着。她的胃里一阵翻涌，心跳加速。'他为什么这样？我何德何能？万一他觉得我太麻烦，决定离开怎么办？' 她颤抖着。他的呼吸平稳，握力坚定；这渐渐让她平静下来。

Asuka pressed her body against his, relishing in the heat. Shinji was not exactly a 'grown man' she had her eyes for, but he was undoubtedly athletic and huggable. Not to mention his other wonderful qualities. 'No, I'm not losing him. I want him, and I'm keeping him. Till death do us part.' Completely ignoring what her last thought implied, she wiggled against him and settled in comfortably. The sleep came to her; this time, the nightmares were replaced with dreams of her and Shinji doing all the dirty things together again – but she didn't resist at all this time.
明日香将身体紧贴着他，享受着那份温暖。真嗣虽非她心中所想的成熟男子，但无疑他体格健壮，抱起来很舒服。更别提他其他令人欣赏的特质了。“不，我不会失去他。我想要他，我要留住他。直到死亡将我们分开。”完全无视自己最后那句话的含义，她在他怀里扭动着，舒适地安顿下来。睡意袭来，这一次，噩梦被她与真嗣再次共度那些私密时光的梦境所取代——而这次，她丝毫没有抗拒。

You couldn't really 'resist' when you were the one on top, right?
当你处于上方时，其实很难说得上是‘抗拒’，对吧？

Unknown to both of them, behind two thin doors, a smug smirk appeared on the face of a particular spy. Thanks to years of experience on the subject of Anti-Reconnaissance, the moment the apartment door opened Kaji's eyes snapped open. At first he thought it was some kind of thief or robber, even an assassin – he silently pulled out his 9mm pistol while keeping his breath steady and slow.
两人都未察觉，在两扇薄薄的门后，某个间谍的脸上露出了得意的笑容。得益于多年反侦察的经验，公寓门一开，加持的双眼便猛地睁开。起初他以为是小偷或强盗，甚至是刺客——他悄无声息地拔出 9 毫米手枪，同时保持呼吸平稳而缓慢。

Then he heard soft knocking sounds. A robber would never knock on the door, right? Confused, he kept listening, his hand clenching on the gun tightly.
接着他听到了轻轻的敲门声。强盗绝不会敲门，对吧？他困惑地继续聆听，手中的枪握得更紧了。

It was then Asuka's voice came to him.
就在那时，明日香的声音传到了他的耳边。

'Way to go, Shinji,' Kaji relaxed and fell back to his bed, 'however, sooner or later I'll let Misato to give them The Talk, we can't take the risk, especially knowing some of the stuff that I probably shouldn't know.' Hearing no more sounds coming from the bedroom across the corridor which indicated the children were doing anything he wouldn't allow them to do yet, Kaji rolled to his side, waiting for sleep to claim him.
'干得好，真嗣，' 加持放松地躺回床上，'不过，迟早我会让美里给他们上那堂课，我们不能冒险，尤其是知道了一些我本不该知道的事情。' 听到走廊对面卧室里没有传来任何表明孩子们在做他还不允许他们做的事情的声音，加持翻身侧躺，等待睡意袭来。

Shinji's alarm went off way too early, but as usual, he managed to awaken within two seconds from its start. What surprised him was that he was unable to disable it – his hand was blocked by something holding it firmly. Something that was making sounds of annoyance and starting to flail around. Faint memories of the night intrusion came back to him.
真嗣的闹钟响得太早了，但和往常一样，他从闹钟响起的两秒内就醒了过来。让他惊讶的是，他竟然无法关掉闹钟——他的手被什么东西紧紧抓住了。那东西正发出恼怒的声音，并开始胡乱挥动。昨晚有人闯入的模糊记忆开始浮现在他脑海中。

'Oh. Right. Asuka came to me. I thought it was a dream…' With some more effort, he freed his hand and disabled the alarm. "Asuka, wake up! You need to go back! Or Kaji-san or Misato-san will know about this!" He managed to shout in a whisper. Asuka, for all her not-a-morning-person nature, knew how to handle alarms and dangers. She jumped up from the bed. She hastily tidied her clothes and gave the apartment a quick scan through the crack, giving Shinji a soft kiss on the cheek and a whisper of "thanks", before disappearing behind the door.
'哦，对了，明日香来找我了。我还以为是梦呢……' 费了些劲，他抽出手来关掉了闹钟。"明日香，快醒醒！你得回去了！不然加持先生或美里小姐会发现我们的！" 他勉强压低声音喊道。尽管明日香不是那种早起的人，但她对闹钟和危险却应对自如。她猛地从床上跳起，急忙整理好衣服，透过门缝迅速扫视了一眼公寓，然后在真嗣脸颊上轻轻一吻，低声说了句"谢谢"，便消失在门后。

Shinji transfixed on his bed, rubbing his cheek and grinning like an idiot at the memory of Asuka completely tousled, with her just-woke-up hair, bad memories completely gone. He shook his head. 'One thing at a time. Breakfast, then shower. And then a long day,' he sighed with resignation before getting up from the bed and started his routine.
真嗣躺在床上，抚摸着脸颊，回想起明日香那凌乱不堪、刚睡醒的模样，不禁傻笑起来，所有不快的记忆都烟消云散了。他摇了摇头，'一件一件来吧。先吃早餐，再洗个澡。然后又是漫长的一天，' 他带着无奈叹了口气，从床上起身开始了自己的日常。

One hour later 一小时后

Four people sat around the dining table in the Katsuragi Residence, enjoying the freshly made breakfast. For some reason Kaji's been looking at Shinji and Asuka with an unreadable expression all the time. Asuka's mood was better than yesterday from the looks of it, so Misato started, "You guys have another test at Gehirn today. Hope you haven't forgotten your sync training yet."
四人围坐在葛城家的餐桌旁，享用着刚做好的早餐。不知为何，加持一直用一种难以捉摸的表情看着真嗣和明日香。从外表看来，明日香的气色比昨天好多了，于是美里开口道：“你们今天在 Gehirn 还有一场测试。希望你们还没忘记同步训练的内容。”

"Who do you think I am? Of course I remember it." / "No worries, Misato." Asuka/Shinji said, eliciting a huff from Misato, "well, it sounds like you guys are out of sync already, do you need more follow-up training?"
“你以为我是谁？当然记得啦。”/“放心吧，美里。”明日香/真嗣回答道，引得美里轻哼一声，“看来你们俩已经不同步了，还需要额外的跟进训练吗？”

Asuka and Shinji looked at each other, then nodded, "no thanks, Misato! We don't need more training!" They said in unison and a high-pitched voice. Misato groaned, clutching her head, "Ugh, keep the voice low please! My head hurts!"
明日香和真嗣对视一眼，随即点头，“不用了，美里！我们不需要更多训练！”他们异口同声地用尖细的声音说道。美里捂着头呻吟起来，“哎呀，声音低点儿行吗！我头疼！”

Asuka huffed before a triumphant smirk appeared on her face, "it's not my problem you drink beer like water," she criticized; on second thought, though, a hangover Misato made it easier and safer for her to sneak into Shinji's room during the nights. 'Since when I'm expecting more of such nights? Gods I'm addicted to his warmth, am I not?' She realized with a faint blush. "Anyways, we'd better hurry up. We've already missed school yesterday to the stupid wedding, and I don't intend to cause more rumors about us!" Asuka sulked as the memories of the wedding ceremony came back to her, her face clouded.
明日香哼了一声，随即脸上浮现出得意的笑容，“你把啤酒当水喝，这可不是我的问题，”她批评道；但转念一想，宿醉的葛城倒让她夜里更容易、更安全地溜进真嗣的房间。'我是什么时候开始期待更多这样的夜晚的？天啊，我是不是迷恋上了他的温暖？' 她意识到这一点，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕。“不管怎样，我们最好快点。昨天因为那愚蠢的婚礼已经错过学校了，我可不想再引起更多关于我们的流言蜚语！”明日香闷闷不乐地说，婚礼的记忆涌上心头，她的脸色阴沉下来。

Shinji nodded, noticing Asuka's shift of mood, "right. I'll pack our lunches, we've still got some Käsespätzle remains." He said, standing up and to the kitchen.
真嗣点头，注意到明日香情绪的变化，“好的。我去打包我们的午餐，还剩下一些奶酪面条。”他说着，起身走向厨房。

He failed to notice the small smile that crept up Asuka's face.
他没注意到明日香脸上悄悄爬上的微笑。

The sound of chatter from the students mingling in front of the school could be heard all the way from up on the roof, where Shinji and Asuka sat, eating their lunches. The morning in the school went uneventfully, their classmates didn't have the heart to ask them why they left Okinawa early. Not that they would speak the truth even if anyone asked, though.
从学校屋顶上，真嗣和明日香坐着吃午餐的地方，可以听到学生们在校门前交谈的声音。上午的学校生活平淡无奇，同学们并没有心思去问他们为何提前离开了冲绳。即便有人问起，他们也不会说出真相。

"You know, you don't have to be up here with little ol' me." Asuka muttered between bites of her Käsespätzle. "I haven't been in a good mood since yesterday, it'll probably buy you some peace if you'd just leave me alone." The Second Child said, shooting a look at the Third, one that told him her feelings without having to say a word. Exhaling, she turned to gaze out at the horizon, allowing for a moment of silence to fall between the two while the sounds of birds chirping and their classmates talking filled the void.
"你知道的，你不必非得陪着我这个小人物。" 明日香一边吃着她的奶酪面疙瘩，一边嘟囔着。"从昨天开始我就心情不好，你如果离开我，或许还能清静些。" 第二适格者说着，向第三适格者投去一瞥，那眼神无需言语便传达了她的情绪。她叹了口气，转头望向地平线，让两人之间陷入片刻的沉默，而鸟鸣和同学们的交谈声填补了这片空白。

Shinji looked down at his half-eaten lunch and considered taking another bite, but quite frankly he just wasn't feeling that hungry anymore. Asuka was his…closest friend. He even dared to say that they may have been more than that at this point, but this impasse was beginning to tear away at the bond they had formed. Biting down on his lip, Shinji decided to change the subject. Though he felt he probably could've picked a much more lighthearted topic of discussion. "What happened yesterday?" He asked, moving his lunch from his lap and onto the roof. "During the wedding, I mean."
真嗣低头看着自己吃了一半的午餐，考虑是否再吃一口，但说实话，他已经不怎么饿了。明日香是他的……最亲近的朋友。他甚至敢说，他们之间的关系可能已经超越了这一点，但这种僵局正开始撕裂他们建立起的纽带。他咬了咬嘴唇，决定换个话题。尽管他觉得自己本可以选择一个更轻松的讨论话题。"昨天发生了什么？" 他问道，将午餐从膝上移到屋顶上。"我是说，在婚礼上。"

Asuka lowered her head and sighed. She had been trying to avoid talking about this, but even she knew that keeping it bottled up inside wouldn't end well for her, not to mention she promised she would talk to him today. On one hand, she didn't want to look weak by sharing her troubles, but on the other, she knew she needed to share the load with someone else. If it had to be anyone though, it would've been Shinji. He was the only person around that she truly felt she could trust. Taking a deep breath, she started, "I…met my mother when I came back from the bathroom."
明日香低下头，叹了口气。她一直试图回避这个话题，但即便她自己也明白，把事情憋在心里对她是不会有好结果的，更不用说她承诺过今天要和他谈谈。一方面，她不想通过倾诉烦恼来显得自己软弱，但另一方面，她知道需要与人分担这份重负。如果非要找个人，那只能是真嗣。他是她周围唯一真正信任的人。深吸一口气后，她开口道：“我……从洗手间回来时，遇到了我妈妈。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow, "your…mother? So… she's alive in this world as well, just like…mine?"
真嗣扬起眉毛，“你……妈妈？这么说……她在这个世界也活着，就像……我的妈妈一样？”

"Yeah," Asuka sighed, "I know this makes me sound like a hypocrite since I was the one telling you she wasn't your mother…" she looked at Shinji, who was showing a serious expression – not the amused look she was half-expecting, "but there's more to that. I've got memories…what exactly did you see during our…in the simulator world, Shinji?"
“嗯，”明日香叹息道，“我知道这让我听起来像个伪君子，毕竟是我告诉你那不是你妈妈……”她看着真嗣，他正表情严肃——并非她半期待的那种戏谑神情，“但事情不止如此。我有些记忆……在我们……在模拟世界里，真嗣，你究竟看到了什么？”

"Um, there's a woman…your mom?" Asuka nodded, "she was holding a doll…and calling your name. And the little you stood outside the room," Asuka's face darkened as Shinji went on, "well, you saw most of it…but there's… there's also…" the words choked at her throat, "when I saw her that day, the memories came back to me. Every now and then I see it." She replied, letting her golden-red bangs fall over her eyes. "I see that stupid doll in her hands. It just stares at me, like it's mocking me. What's worse, she even had a daughter in this world…"
呃，有个女人…你妈妈？" 明日香点了点头，"她抱着一个娃娃…喊着你的名字。而小小的你站在房间外，" 明日香的脸色沉了下来，随着真嗣继续说，"嗯，你大部分都看到了…但是…还有…" 她的话哽在喉咙里，"那天我看到她时，那些记忆又回来了。时不时地，我就会看到。" 她回答道，让金红色的刘海遮住了眼睛。"我看到她手里的那个愚蠢的娃娃。它就那样盯着我，好像在嘲笑我。更糟糕的是，她在这个世界上甚至还有个女儿…

Shinji unconsciously let his hand fell into the empty space between them. Whether or not he had intended for this to happen or not, he didn't know, but the palm of his hand fell right onto the back of Asuka's. Almost instinctively he found himself tightening his grip just a little bit, only to have his heart turn to ice when she returned the gesture, locking her fingers around his.
真嗣无意识地让手落在了他们之间的空隙中。他不知道这是否是有意为之，但他的手掌恰好落在了明日香的手背上。几乎是本能地，他发现自己稍微收紧了握力，而当她回应这个动作，手指紧紧缠绕住他的时，他的心却瞬间冰冷。

"I'm sorry, Asuka-" 对不起，明日香——

The redhead smirked, rolling her eyes under her bangs. "You're such an idiot. Even when you do something right, you still say something stupid."
红发女孩嘴角勾起一抹嘲讽的笑，刘海下的眼睛翻了个白眼。"你真是个笨蛋。即使做对了事情，说出来的话还是那么蠢。"

Shinji cocked his head, and gave a puzzled expression. "What do you mean?"
真嗣歪着头，露出困惑的表情。“你什么意思？”

The redhead lifted her hand up while still hanging onto Shinji's, and closed in the space between them until she was sitting as close as she could to him. Once she was next to him, Asuka rested her head on Shinji's shoulder, her wavy mane grazing against his cheek as she laid their adjoining hands on her lap. "All you had to do was hold my hand, Baka."
红发少女一边紧握着真嗣的手，一边举起另一只手，缩短了他们之间的距离，直到她尽可能地紧挨着他坐下。当她靠在他身边时，明日香将头枕在真嗣的肩上，她那波浪般的长发轻拂着他的脸颊，同时将他们相握的手放在自己的膝上。“你只需要握住我的手，笨蛋。”

The brown-haired teen found himself at a loss of words, frozen in place while this beautiful girl gently rested her head against him, and began tracing her thumb along the back of his hand. He was too terrified to move, afraid that if he did anything, he would simply ruin the moment entirely.
棕发少年发现自己无言以对，呆立在原地，任由这位美丽的女孩温柔地将头倚在他身上，开始用拇指轻轻摩挲他手背。他害怕得不敢动弹，生怕自己稍有动作，就会彻底破坏这一刻的美好。

After a while, he found himself loosening a bit. He allowed for his shoulders to slouch slightly giving Asuka a much less uncomfortable place to rest her head, and his grip on her hand softened in such a way that allowed more freedom of movement, but not to the point in which it felt the connection between them was breaking away. Though the world around him seemed to still be moving, all that really mattered to him at this point in time was the gorgeous, feisty redhead that peacefully rested against him.
过了一会儿，他发现自己放松了一些。他让肩膀微微下垂，给明日香提供了一个不那么难受的倚靠之处，握着她的手也变得柔和，既给了她更多活动的自由，又不至于让人感觉他们之间的联系正在消散。尽管周围的世界似乎仍在运转，但此刻对他来说，真正重要的是那个美丽而倔强的红发女孩，正安详地依偎在他身旁。

The ride to the Geofront was quiet but not uncomfortable. Asuka rested her head on her palms, using the car door as support. She looked out through the window, a turmoil of thoughts in her head. On one hand, she was happy to see her mother again, albeit she's not exactly her mother. On the other hand, she feared the woman, since she would trigger her darkest memories, and her daughter kept reminding Asuka of the doll.
前往第三新东京市的路上静谧而不失舒适。明日香将头枕在手掌上，以车门为支撑。她望向窗外，脑海中思绪纷乱。一方面，她很高兴能再次见到母亲，尽管那并非真正的母亲。另一方面，她又害怕那个女人，因为她会触发自己最黑暗的记忆，而那个女孩总让她想起那个玩偶。

She would never forget the day she became an EVA pilot – the simultaneously happiest and scariest day of her life.
她永远不会忘记成为 EVA 驾驶员的那一天——那是她生命中最快乐也最恐惧的时刻。

With all that being said, Asuka thought she needed to move on. And the fact that she was thrown into this new world would be a perfect opportunity.
尽管如此，明日香认为自己需要向前看。而她被抛入这个新世界，正是一个完美的契机。

Asuka splashed water all over her face, trying to calm down. "I have to do this," she murmured to herself, looking into the mirror, "I have to, I must." She mustered all of her confidence and willpower and stepped out of the bathroom.
明日香将水泼洒在脸上，试图让自己平静下来。“我必须这么做，”她对着镜子低声自语，“我必须，我一定要。”她鼓起所有的勇气和意志力，走出了洗手间。

Kyoko and Mana were on a short sightseeing trip in the Geofront – Asuka saw them on the field before she entered the bathroom.
绫波和真嗣正在第三新东京市地下都市进行短暂的观光之旅——明日香在进入洗手间前看到他们在场地上。

A familiar male voice captured her attention. "…a hobby of mine." She followed the voice and saw Kaji was watering something with a kettle, talking with Kyoko and Mana with a smile on his face. Mana paid her attention to the plants on the ground – a closer look Asuka identified them as watermelons.
一个熟悉的男性声音吸引了她的注意。“……这是我的一个小爱好。”她循声望去，看到加持正用壶浇着什么，与绫波和真嗣交谈，脸上带着微笑。真嗣的注意力集中在地上的植物上——明日香仔细一看，认出那是西瓜。

Asuka took a deep breath. Conveniently, Kaji could be used as an entrance to their group. "Kaji!" She called out to the man, who jerked his head in the redhead's direction, "oh, hi Asuka. I'm afraid you just found out my deepest secret."
明日香深吸了一口气。正好，加持可以作为她加入他们团体的切入点。“加持！”她向那个男人喊道，他转头看向红发少女，“哦，嗨，明日香。恐怕你刚发现了我的最大秘密。”

Asuka chuckled, "I've never thought of you as a gardening type."
明日香轻笑道：“我从没把你当成园艺爱好者。”

Kyoko looked in her direction with curiosity. Asuka's heartbeat fastened as their gazes met; she kept her cool composure at the moment. "Oh, you're the young lady at the wedding," she started, "wait…you don't happen to be the famous Second Child, do you?" She raised her eyebrows.
绫波带着好奇看向她。两人的目光相遇，明日香的心跳加速，但她仍保持着冷静的外表。“哦，你是婚礼上的那位小姐，”她开口道，“等等……你该不会就是那位著名的第二适格者吧？”她挑了挑眉毛。

Asuka smirked, her usual arrogance coming back, effectively suppressed her fear and anxiety, "Of course I am! I am Asuka L-Shikinami, charmed, huh?"
明日香嘴角勾起一抹傲慢的笑，她惯有的傲气回来了，有效地压制了她的恐惧和焦虑，“当然是我！我是式波·明日香·兰格雷，很迷人吧？”

Kyoko smiled a little, "Asuka…" the said girl shivered since she had been longing to hear that voice say her name to her for a long time, "nice name. Actually, I was thinking of naming my daughter Asuka." The redhead was already on the edge of tears, she rubbed her eyes as a gust of wind blew off, pretending dirt got into her eyes. "Anyways, I'm Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu, nice to meet you, Asuka!" She stuck out a hand for a shake.
绫波微微一笑，“明日香……”被叫到名字的女孩不禁颤抖，因为她渴望听到那个声音呼唤她的名字已经很久了，“好名字。其实，我一直在想给我的女儿取名明日香。”红发女孩眼眶已泛泪光，她揉了揉眼睛，一阵风吹过，假装是灰尘进了眼睛。“不管怎样，我是绫波·齐柏林·惣流，很高兴认识你，明日香！”她伸出手来握手。

Asuka stared at the hand for God knows how long, but it mustn't be very long since the moment she raised her own hand Kyoko was still smiling at her. She took her hand and shook lightly – her hands were already shaking, anyway. Kyoko released her hand and carefully looked at Asuka, frowning a little, "hmmm… you've got nice red hair and blue eyes, just like me," Asuka's breath quickened, "I assume you're from Germany as well?"
明日香盯着那只手不知过了多久，但应该不会太久，因为当她举起自己的手时，绫波仍然对她微笑着。她握住绫波的手，轻轻摇了摇——她的手已经在颤抖了。绫波松开手，仔细地打量着明日香，微微皱眉，“嗯……你有着漂亮的红色头发和蓝色眼睛，就像我一样，”明日香的呼吸急促起来，“我猜你也是来自德国吧？”

"Ja, gnädige Frau!" Asuka replied in German, completely ignoring the fact that she didn't have a real social record in this world, "it's surely a great country!" Kaji raised an eyebrow at her words, noting to himself about another mystery to be investigated.
“Ja, gnädige Frau!” 明日香用德语回答，完全忽略了在这个世界上她并没有真正的社交记录，“那确实是一个伟大的国家！” 加持对她的回答扬了扬眉毛，暗自记下又一个需要调查的谜团。

Kyoko laughed a little, "right." She and Asuka went on and chatted about other stuff, such as what it was like to be connected to a simulator, or how did it feel to live in a foreign land. Asuka said she adapted to it quite quickly, while Kyoko admitted that she had difficulties understanding some of the social etiquettes of the country. Asuka's anxiety and fear slowly subsided – she felt the holes in her heart being slowly repaired by the kind smiles Kyoko showed to her.
绫波轻笑一声，“是啊。”她和明日香继续聊起了其他话题，比如与模拟器连接是什么感觉，或者在异国他乡生活是怎样的体验。明日香说她很快就适应了，而绫波则承认自己在理解这个国家的某些社交礼仪上遇到了困难。明日香的焦虑和恐惧逐渐消退——她感到心中的空洞正被绫波温柔的笑容慢慢填补。

Gods she missed those. 天哪，她多么怀念那些笑容。

"Alright, I think it's time for me to go," Kyoko looked at her watch, "Mana! Let's go and have dinner with auntie Yui!"
好了，我想我该走了。"京子看了看手表，"真名！我们一起去和阿姨由依吃晚饭吧！

"Erm, Mrs. Soryu," Asuka closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She needed to know the answer-
"呃，索龙夫人，"明日香闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。她需要知道答案——

"Yes, Asuka?" Kyoko's smile kept melting Asuka's heart.
"怎么了，明日香？"京子的微笑让明日香的心不断融化。

"Your daughter…Mana, is really cute," she finally said - despite the image of the doll taunting on her - to which Kyoko's smile grew into a grin, "this may sound stupid but…how much do you love your daughter?" She carefully picked up the words.
"您的女儿……真名，真的很可爱，"她终于说出了口——尽管那个玩偶的形象仍在嘲弄她——对此，京子的笑容变成了咧嘴笑，"这可能听起来很傻，但是……您有多爱您的女儿？"她小心翼翼地挑选着措辞。

Kyoko's reply was instant, "there's nothing I wouldn't do for my own daughter," she said with a loving smile, "not even death could ever stop that."
绫波的回答立刻传来，“为了我自己的女儿，我什么都愿意做，”她带着慈爱的微笑说道，“哪怕是死亡也无法阻止我。”

Asuka blinked…then she walked forward and pulled Kyoko in for a light hug. The said woman tensed up as she was a little startled by the sudden gesture, to say the least – but she did not unwelcome it. In fact, she felt unspoken pleasantness from the hug, so she returned it with equal passion.
明日香眨了眨眼……然后她走上前，轻轻地拥抱了绫波。被拥抱的女子显然有些吃惊，身体一紧——但并不抗拒。事实上，她从拥抱中感受到了未言明的愉悦，于是她也以同样的热情回应了这个拥抱。

As for Auska, she did it for two reasons: for one, she had to hide her teary face – or it would raise suspicions. Showing such strong emotion in public, added with her astonishing physical similarity with Kyoko, she was sure some smart people in Gehirn would connect the dots. On the other hand – she was an emotional wreck, and she needed the physical contact from people she liked to calm her down. Since Shinji was not in the vicinity, and Kaji would definitely get the wrong ideas, Kyoko became the natural choice.
至于明日香，她这么做有两个原因：首先，她必须隐藏自己泪眼婆娑的面容——否则会引起怀疑。在公众场合表现出如此强烈的情感，再加上她与绫波惊人的外貌相似，她确信 GEHIRN 中的一些聪明人会看出端倪。另一方面——她情绪崩溃，需要来自她喜欢的人的肢体接触来平复心情。既然附近没有真嗣，而加持肯定会误会，绫波就成了自然的选择。

Asuka pulled away from the hug after the tears went dry, instantly turning her face away from Kyoko. "It's really nice to know you, Mrs. Soryu," she added with a sob camouflaged by a cough, "I also have to go now! Have a nice day! Goodbye!" She waved her hand and began walking away.
泪痕干涸后，明日香从拥抱中抽身，立刻将脸转向别处，避开绫波。“真的很高兴认识您，索龙夫人，”她带着哽咽，借咳嗽掩饰道，“我也该走了！祝您有个美好的一天！再见！”她挥了挥手，开始迈步离开。

"Goodbye, Asuka!" Kyoko replied out of courtesy, but not without a genuine smile of her own.
“再见，明日香！”绫波出于礼貌回应，脸上却带着真挚的微笑。

On her way to the Gehirn pyramid, Asuka never once turned her head back.
前往 GEHIRN 金字塔的路上，明日香始终未曾回头。

Shinji leaned on the railings of the maintenance shafts in the testing chamber, the earplugs playing Ode to Joy isolated him from the rest of the world. In the last hour or so, he wandered around Gehirn's pyramid, hoping to find Asuka, but she's nowhere to be seen. She said she had some "personal business" to attend to.
真嗣倚在测试室维护通道的栏杆上，耳塞中播放的《欢乐颂》让他与世隔绝。过去一个多小时里，他在 GEHIRN 金字塔内徘徊，希望能找到明日香，但她踪影全无。她说自己有些“私事”要处理。

He looked at the entry plug intently, musing about all the things that had happened since he was called by his father and came to Tokyo-3. At first he thought it would be some kind of family reunion; however he merely had a use for his father, who demanded him to pilot a machine he'd never even heard of before, and fight some sort of extraterrestrial monster a bomb as powerful as nuclear weapon barely slowed down, otherwise humanity would go extinct.
他凝视着插入栓，思绪飘回了自从被父亲召唤来到第三新东京市后所发生的一切。起初，他以为会是某种家庭团聚；然而，他只是被父亲利用，要求他驾驶一个前所未闻的机器，去对抗一种外星怪物，这种怪物连核武器级别的炸弹都难以阻挡，否则人类将面临灭绝。

And he did it to spite his father.
而他这么做，只是为了反抗他的父亲。

Then he fought more Angels – at the time he didn't know why he did it, perhaps it was because he had no other purpose in life, and EVA could earn him praises he craved; perhaps he did it to earn the compliments from his father.
随后，他继续与更多的使徒战斗——那时他并不清楚自己为何而战，或许是因为生活中别无他求，而驾驶 EVA 能赢得他所渴望的赞誉；或许是为了赢得父亲的认可。

His thoughts wandered back to recent days. What's his purpose in the new world? To…participate in some test that no one else in the world could? Or…to stay together with someone he cared about?
他的思绪又飘回到最近的日子。在这个新世界中，他的目的是什么？是为了参与一项全世界无人能及的测试吗？还是……为了与他在乎的人共度时光？

Shinji's train of thought screeched to a halt as a voice called out to him. "Shkinami-kun?" He turned in the direction of the voice and saw a blue-haired girl, "Ayanami?" he said.
真嗣的思绪戛然而止，一道声音呼唤着他：“真希波君？”他循声望去，只见一位蓝发少女，“绫波？”他脱口而出。

Rei Ikari let it slip, "hello, Shikinami-kun. My mom wishes to see you!" She spoke, turning around, and waved. Yui Ikari emerged and smiled at Rei, "so he is Shinji Shikinami, dear?"
绫波·碇不经意间透露：“你好，真希波君。我妈妈想见你！”她边说边转身挥手。随后，绫波·唯现身，对着绫波微笑道：“他就是真嗣·真希波，亲爱的？”

"Yeah," Rei replied, "he's the Third Child. Can you be quick? I'm kinda starving," she complained.
“嗯，”绫波回应道，“他是第三适格者。你能快点吗？我有点饿坏了，”她抱怨着。

"Rei, you can go and hang out with Mana, she's here as well," Yui said, stroking Rei's hair, "go. I'll come as soon as possible."
“绫波，你可以去找真名玩，她也在呢，”唯轻抚着绫波的头发说，“去吧。我尽快过来。”

"Alright mama," Rei smiled and walked away before Yui walked to Shinji. The said boy watched the whole ordeal with tightness in his chest. He stood there transfixed as Yui came closer and closer to him, a polite smile on her face. "Hello, Shinji Shikinami?" She greeted as she stopped and stood several meters in front of the boy.
"好的，妈妈。" 绫波微笑着走开了，而绫波则走向了真嗣。那个男孩目睹了整个场景，胸口紧绷。他站在那里，一动不动，看着绫波越来越近，脸上带着礼貌的微笑。"你好，真嗣·式波？" 她停下脚步，站在离男孩几米远的地方问候道。

"Y-yeah," Shinji took a deep breath, "um, wh-what's the m-matter?" He stammered out, his left hand clenched and unclenched, his face pale.
"嗯，是，" 真嗣深吸了一口气，"呃，有，有什么事吗？" 他结结巴巴地说，左手紧握又松开，脸色苍白。

Yui must've noticed his nervousness but made no comment, whether she cared or not no one knew. "Good! I'm Yui Ikari, Commander's wife," she spoke as she carefully examined the boy in front of her, "hmm… I'd say you look a lot like Rei, to the extent strangers might think you're my son or something," she added with a chuckle, eliciting a chill ran down Shinji's spine.
绫波肯定注意到了他的紧张，但没有发表任何评论，她是否关心，无人知晓。"很好！我是绫波·碇，司令的妻子，" 她边说边仔细打量着面前的男孩，"嗯……我觉得你看起来很像绫波，以至于陌生人可能会以为你是我儿子之类的，" 她笑着补充道，让真嗣脊背发凉。

The aforementioned boy gulped, "I-um, I'd love to?" He blushed as his words registered in his brain, "err, sorry! I mean-"
那个男孩咽了口口水，"我，呃，我很愿意？" 他的脸颊泛红，意识到自己的话后，"呃，对不起！我是说——"

Yui chuckled and waved her hand, gesturing to Shinji to stop panicking, "it's okay, I know what you mean. You're really cute when you're embarrassed, you know." She pondered for a moment, "anyways, have you properly met my daughter?"
绫波轻笑一声，挥手示意真嗣别慌张，“没事的，我明白你的意思。你害羞的样子真的很可爱呢。”她沉思片刻，“对了，你正式见过我女儿了吗？”

Shinji coughed as the memory of Rei and his first encounter in this world, as well as their encounter in the old world in her apartment, resurfaced, "well, we talked a little bit, but not much."
真嗣轻咳一声，回忆起在这个世界与零的初次相遇，以及在旧世界她公寓里的那次邂逅，“嗯，我们聊了几句，但不多。”

"Do you think she's cute?" Yui asked out of blue, her expression unreadable.
“你觉得她可爱吗？”绫波突然发问，表情难以捉摸。

"What? I mean, I guess," Shinji was taken aback by the sudden question.
“什么？呃，我想是的，”真嗣被这突如其来的问题弄得措手不及。

Yui showed a disappointed face, "just this?"
绫显得一脸失望，“就这些？”

"Well, she does have nice blue hair," Shinji gulped as he knew he was stepping into a minefield, "and, erm, she looks pretty, I suppose…"
“嗯，她确实有一头漂亮的蓝发，”真嗣咽了口唾沫，意识到自己正踏入雷区，“而且，呃，我觉得她挺漂亮的，我想……”

Yui smirked, "are you interested?"
绫嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，“你感兴趣了？”

"Erm, what?" Shinji raised an eyebrow, then blushed as he realized what she meant, "I…um, I…I like somebody else…sorry…"
“呃，什么？”真嗣挑了挑眉，随即脸红起来，意识到她的意思，“我…呃，我…我喜欢别人…对不起…”

"Oh…" Yui couldn't even hide the disappointment in her voice, "fine. Good for you young man," she waved and ready to go, "see you later, then."
哦…" 结城连失望的声音都掩饰不住，"好吧。年轻人，你自便吧，" 她挥了挥手，准备离开，"那回头见。

"Wait," Shinji called out, stopping Yui dead in her tracks, "I…I have a question…"
等等，" 真嗣叫住了结城，让她停下了脚步，"我…我有个问题…

"Sure, go ahead." 当然，问吧。

"Erm… what's the commander like?" Shinji sighed before taking a deep breath, "I mean…is he…a good father? No sorry that's doesn't sound right…" he hastily apologized as he saw Yui frowned a little, "I mean, he stays at work almost all the time, so…"
呃…指挥官是个什么样的人？" 真嗣叹了口气，然后深吸一口气，"我的意思是…他…是个好父亲吗？不，抱歉，这么说不太对…" 他看到结城微微皱眉，急忙道歉，"我是说，他几乎所有时间都在工作，所以…

Yui sighed and rubbed her forehead, "he's…very busy, yeah," her eyes wandered around, "but one thing for sure – he loves his daughter more than anything in his life, maybe except me."
绫叹了口气，揉了揉额头，“他……确实很忙，嗯，”她的目光四处游移，“但有一点可以肯定——他爱他的女儿胜过生命中的任何事物，或许除了我。”

"Oh…" Shinji didn't know what to make out of her remarks, "t-thanks, Ikari-san."
“哦……”真嗣不知该如何理解她的话，“谢、谢谢，碇女士。”

"No problem, Shikinami," Yui smiled a polite smile, "bye!" She said and turned around.
“不客气，式波，”绫礼貌地微笑着，“再见！”她说完便转身离去。

"Goodbye," 'mother', Shinji closed his eyes, his knees wobble. He leaned on the railings to keep him supported, panting heavily. The emotional roller-coaster he just rode was a wild one, but finally, he might have got the answers he wanted to hear.
“再见，”母亲，真嗣闭上眼睛，膝盖微微颤抖。他倚靠在栏杆上以支撑自己，喘息沉重。刚刚经历的情感过山车异常激烈，但最终，他可能听到了渴望已久的答案。

"Oh, there you are, Asuka," Shinji called out to the redhead as he saw her in the cafeteria, who was staring at the so-called 'food' in front of her. She turned her head to the boy and smiled, "hey Baka, you surely took your time."
哦，你在这儿啊，明日香。" 真嗣在食堂看到红发的她，正盯着面前的所谓"食物"发呆。她转头对男孩笑了笑，"嘿，笨蛋，你可真够慢的。

Shinji blinked, "you…know what I was doing?"
真嗣眨了眨眼，"你……知道我刚才在做什么？"

"I can only guess the same as me," Asuka smirked, "you met your mother, didn't you?"
我只能猜和我一样吧，" 明日香狡黠地笑了笑，"你见到了你妈妈，对吧？

"Yeah…" Shinji replied, sitting down across the redhead, "no appetite?"
嗯……" 真嗣回答着，坐到了红发女孩对面，"没胃口吗？

"Shinji, I just talked with my mother, who was dead back in the old world, not to mention all the horrible memories associated with her kept resurfacing whenever I see her face," Asuka's voice carried a bit of her usual fire and discomfort, "even if this is some German food feast I wouldn't have any appetite, much less for the junk they serve here!"
真嗣，我刚和在这个新世界已经去世的母亲谈过，更别提每次看到她的脸，那些关于她的可怕记忆就不断涌现，"明日香的声音带着她一贯的火气和不适，"即便这是什么德国美食盛宴，我也没胃口，更别提这里供应的垃圾食物了！

"I guess you're right…I don't want to eat anything as well," Shinji sighed, "I-I've learned a lot from my mom…Yui, I think I can finally understand something."
我想你是对的…我也不想吃任何东西，"真嗣叹了口气，"我-我从妈妈…唯那里学到了很多…我觉得我终于能理解一些事情了。

Asuka nodded, "me too. Before I thought momma didn't love me anymore…now I realize no matter what, she still loves me… it's just…" Asuka trailed off and smiled a sad smile, "hey Shinji, I think I can move on now. What about you?" She looked at Shinji with a mix of anticipation and nervousness.
明日香点了点头，"我也是。以前我以为妈妈不再爱我了…现在我意识到，无论如何，她依然爱我…只是…"明日香话音渐弱，露出了一个悲伤的微笑，"嘿，真嗣，我想我现在可以向前看了。你呢？"她带着期待和紧张的混合情绪看向真嗣。

"M-move on?" Shinji pondered for a moment, "I mean, I guess, since I've already...got my answers..."
向-向前看？"真嗣沉思了一会儿，"我是说，我想，既然我已经…得到了答案…

Asuka sighed, her palm met her face, "Gods you're so dense," she smiled an uneasy smile, "I mean…do you wanna kiss?"
明日香叹了口气，手掌贴在脸上，“天哪，你真是迟钝，”她勉强笑了笑，“我的意思是…你想接吻吗？”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. He couldn't believe what he thought he just heard. "Wha-what?"
真嗣挑了挑眉，不敢相信自己刚才似乎听到的内容。“什…什么？”

"I said kiss. Kiss." Asuka narrowed her eyes by a tiny bit, standing up from the seat.
“我说的是接吻。接吻。”明日香微微眯起眼睛，从座位上站了起来。

"But…we haven't brushed our teeth!" Shinji stood up as well.
“但是…我们还没刷牙呢！”真嗣也站了起来。

Asuka smirked, "I don't particularly care. What, you scared of a little kiss? Trying to find an excuse?"
明日香嘴角一挑，“我倒是不怎么在乎。怎么，怕了一个小小的吻？找借口呢？”

"No, of course not!" Shinji denied, although his heartbeat started to speed up, "pucker up!" He knew this was the moment not to run away – the prophesier's words still rang at his ears.
“不，当然不是！”真嗣否认道，尽管他的心跳开始加速，“准备好！”他知道这是不能逃避的时刻——预言者的话仍在耳边回响。

"Okay. Here I come." Asuka leaned forward, her movements mirrored by Shinji. They looked into each other's eyes as their lips came closer; she can see the faint blush of his face and the pulse jumping wildly on the side of his neck. She could feel her pulse jumping just as fast.
“好。我来了。”明日香倾身向前，真嗣的动作与之同步。他们凝视着对方的眼睛，双唇逐渐靠近；她能看到他脸颊上淡淡的绯红和颈侧狂跳的脉搏。她能感觉到自己的脉搏也跳得同样快。

"Stop breathing so hard!" Asuka hissed, reaching her hand up towards his nose. "You're tickling m-" And there it was. A sudden jolt of either bravery or impulse coursed through Shinji's body as he leaned forward before Asuka could pinch down on his nose. At first the redhead's eyes went wide the second their lips made contact, but then they slowly started to close as she made a sigh of contentment. This was good. Or at least she thought it was good, as she'd never been kissed before – at least not in her memory. She didn't think Shinji could be this assertive, which made it all the more surprising when she felt something slip between her lips.
"别喘那么大声！"明日香低声说道，伸手朝他的鼻子探去。"你弄得我痒痒的——"就在这时，一股突如其来的勇气或冲动涌遍真嗣全身，他向前倾身，在明日香捏住他的鼻子之前吻了上去。起初，红发少女的眼睛因惊讶而睁大，但随后缓缓闭上，发出一声满足的叹息。这感觉很好。至少她觉得很好，因为她从未有过这样的吻——至少在她的记忆中没有。她没想到真嗣会如此主动，当感觉到有什么东西滑入自己唇间时，她更是感到意外。

Shinji's heart was beating hard enough to power a locomotive. He was almost certain that Asuka could feel his pulse through his lips. He felt like he was on autopilot right now, and all he could do was watch as his body just did what it thought was right. He put his guard down long enough for Asuka to suddenly push forward and spin him around, slamming his back on the table while she leaned into the kiss. It was at this point that Shinji realized that his arms were wrapped around her waist, as her hands were locked behind his neck. After what felt like an eternity later, they pulled away from each other. Asuka's sapphire eyes looked over at Shinji's hazel, seeing that he was just as dazed as she was.
真嗣的心跳得足以驱动一辆火车。他几乎确信明日香能通过他的唇感受到他的脉搏。他觉得自己现在就像是在自动驾驶，只能眼睁睁看着身体去做它认为正确的事。他放松警惕的瞬间，明日香突然发力，将他旋转过来，猛地把他背部撞在桌子上，同时倾身吻了上去。这时，真嗣意识到自己的手臂已经环抱在她的腰间，而她的双手则紧扣在他的颈后。仿佛过了永恒那么久，他们才彼此分开。明日香那蓝宝石般的眼睛望向真嗣的榛色眼眸，发现他同样神魂颠倒。

"Wow." She exhaled. "哇。" 她轻声叹息。

"Yeah." Shinji replied, breathing heavily as he looked up at the ceiling, feeling like he was about to pass out.
"是啊。" 真嗣回答道，他喘着粗气，抬头望向天花板，感觉自己快要晕过去了。

Asuka raised her hand and caressed Shinji's face, "you know, I think…we should give a conclusion to what we've been doing for the last month," she carefully chose her words, "Oh, fuck it. Shinji, do you remember when we told each other we're the closest people we have? I mean, that I'm the closest one you have and you're the closest one I have?"
明日香抬起手，轻抚真嗣的脸颊，"你知道吗，我觉得……我们应该对我们这一个月来所做的事情做个了结，" 她斟酌着措辞，"哦，去他的。真嗣，你还记得我们曾告诉对方，彼此是我们最亲近的人吗？我的意思是，我是你最亲近的人，而你是我最亲近的人？"

Shinji nodded. "Of course," he smiled warmly. "How could I forget?"
真嗣点了点头。“当然，”他温和地笑了笑。“我怎么会忘记呢？”

"Do you still mean it?" she asked in a soft tone, her expression half-worried, half-threatening. He blinked, his expression heavily confused. "Yes?" Asuka let her breath out and closed her eyes. "I am happy around you," she declared as she opened her eyes and stared directly into his. "And I want it to last," she said, her blush and pulse increasing with every word. Shinji blinked in surprise, then smiled. "Asuka… I…"
“你还当真吗？”她轻声问道，表情半是担忧，半是威胁。他眨了眨眼，一脸困惑。“是的？”明日香吐出一口气，闭上了眼睛。“和你在一起我很开心，”她睁开眼，直视他的眼睛宣布道。“我希望这份感觉能持续下去，”她每说一个字，脸颊上的红晕和心跳都在加速。真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼，然后笑了。“明日香…我…”

"I… like that. All that," she gestured vaguely. "And I like you," she declared, her voice unstable. "And I want you to be mine," she declared, the firmness of her voice growing with every word. "Mine, nobody else's! Call it 'boyfriend', call it 'partner'," she hesitated before smirking. "But be mine. And I'll be yours. Can you take me?" her gaze remained unblinking for the whole declaration.
“我…喜欢那样。所有那些，”她含糊地比划着。“还有你，”她宣称，声音有些颤抖。“我希望你属于我，”她语气坚定，每说一个字都更加有力。“只属于我，不属于任何人！可以叫你‘男朋友’，也可以叫‘伴侣’，”她犹豫了一下，然后露出一丝坏笑。“但你要属于我。而我也会属于你。你能接受我吗？”她的目光在整个宣言中始终没有眨动。

"Yes," Shinji smiled. 'So this is how you capture the red dragon...not so bad as I thought...'
“好的，”真嗣微笑着。‘原来这就是捕获红龙的方式...并没有我想象的那么糟...’

"So, hi, boyfriend," Asuka let out a sigh of relief, joyfulness washed over her face, "let's go get our job done."
那么，嗨，男朋友，" 明日香松了一口气，脸上洋溢着喜悦，"我们去把任务完成吧。

The silent testing chamber buzzed to life as Shinji and Asuka settled inside the entry plug and waited for the activation. "Get ready you two," the comm channel came Naoko Akagi's voice, "remember how you did it last time? Do it again and we'll be good."
静默的测试舱随着真嗣和明日香进入插入栓内并等待激活而活跃起来。"准备好了吗，你们两个，" 通讯频道传来赤木直子的声音，"记得上次是怎么做的吗？再做一次，我们就没问题了。"

"Roger," the Children answered in unison.
"收到，" 两位少年异口同声地回答。

"Alright, begin the activation sequence."
好的，开始激活程序。

Maya typed a few keystrokes, "first-level connection established! Begin second phase."
玛雅敲击了几下键盘，“一级连接已建立！开始第二阶段。”

Shinji and Asuka's vision went white.
真嗣和明日香的视野变得一片空白。

'So it's this place again…' Asuka grudgingly opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was the green leaves of the big cypress tree. She brushed off the grass on her face and sat up, scanning her surroundings. To her left a brown-haired boy was lying still, Asuka huffed and smacked him in the forehead. "Ouch!" Shinji woke up as well, frantically looking around him. He smiled a small smile as he settled his eyes on Asuka, "oh, hi Asuka." He shook his head, "so we're here again, huh?"
'又是这个地方啊…' 明日香不情愿地睁开眼睛，映入眼帘的第一幕便是那棵大柏树的绿叶。她拂去脸上的草屑，坐起身来，环顾四周。左边躺着一个棕发男孩，一动不动，明日香哼了一声，伸手在他额头上拍了一下。“哎哟！”真嗣也醒了，慌张地四下张望。当他目光落在明日香身上时，露出了淡淡的微笑，“哦，嗨，明日香。”他摇摇头，“看来我们又回到这里了，是吧？”

"Yeah," Asuka stood up, "I wonder where is the little us, though." She helped Shinji got up on his feet, both of them patted their clothes to wipe off the dirt; then a round of innocent laughter caught their attention.
"是啊，" 明日香站起身来，“不知道小时候的我们在哪儿呢。”她扶真嗣站起来，两人拍了拍衣服上的尘土；这时，一阵纯真的笑声吸引了他们的注意。

Following the sound, they surprisingly found little Shinji and Asuka were sitting around a sandbox giggling, a pyramid-shaped sandcastle stood in the middle of it. Shinji and Asuka nodded to each other and walked to the younger them. "Hey!" Asuka called out, waving her hand, "here!"
循着声音，他们惊讶地发现小真嗣和小明日香正坐在沙坑旁咯咯笑，一座金字塔形的沙堡矗立其中。真嗣和明日香相视点头，走向年幼的自己。“嘿！”明日香挥手呼唤，“这边！”

Little Shinji and Asuka turned their heads, an ear-to-ear grin spread on both of their faces as they saw who was calling to them. "You're back, big sister!" Little Shinji exclaimed in happiness and dashed to Asuka, immediately wrapped his arms around the redhead. Asuka was a bit startled but soon returned the hug. Little Asuka huffed, "Shinji!" She cried, "what did you promise?"
小真嗣和小明日香转过头来，看到呼唤他们的人后，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。“你回来啦，姐姐！”小真嗣开心地喊着，冲向明日香，立刻紧紧抱住了红发少女。明日香起初有些吃惊，但很快也回以拥抱。小明日香嘟囔着，“真嗣！”她喊道，“你答应过什么来着？”

Little Shinji released the hug, his face red in embarrassment, "um, that I'm yours?" He walked back to the side of little Asuka, "so-sorry."
小真嗣松开拥抱，满脸通红，尴尬地说：“呃，说我是你的？”他走回小明日香身边，“对-对不起。”

"Hmph, I'll let it slip this time since she's also me," little Asuka smacked the back of his head playfully before turning her attention to Shinji, "so you came back, huh?" She put her hands on her hips, then shot Asuka a glare, "Shinji is mine! Understood?"
“哼，这次看在也是我的份上就放过你，”小明日香俏皮地拍了拍他的后脑勺，然后转向真嗣，“所以你回来了，是吧？”她双手叉腰，随即向明日香投去一瞥，“真嗣是我的！明白了吗？”

Asuka half-laughed, embarrassed, "yeah, yeah, take him for all I care." She then turned to Shinji, who was blushing slightly, "because I have this one!" She patted Shinji's shoulder.
明日香半是尴尬地笑了笑，“行吧，行吧，随他去吧。”随后她转向略显脸红的真嗣，“因为我有这个家伙了！”她拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。

Shinji chuckled nervously, "um, so I see the little you are very possessive," he looked at Asuka with a half-incredulous, half-amused look.
真嗣紧张地轻笑一声，“呃，看来你对你那位挺霸道的嘛，”他带着半是难以置信、半是好笑的表情看向明日香。

Asuka frowned and shot him a threatening glare, "got any problem with that, THIRD?"
明日香皱起眉头，狠狠地瞪了他一眼，“有什么问题吗，三号？”

"N-no, of course not!" Shinji hastily denied, "I mean, as long as you don't treat me like some merchandise, I should be fine with that," he trailed off, hesitant saying the next words, "as long as… you're fine with being mine."
“不、不，当然没有！”真嗣急忙否认，“我是说，只要你别把我当商品对待，我应该没问题，”他支支吾吾地说着，犹豫着说出下一句，“只要……你愿意属于我。”

Asuka smirked, "if the same conditions apply, I should be just fine."
明日香嘴角一挑，“如果条件相同，我应该没问题。”

The little Asuka and Shinji watched the exchange in amusement, "um…are you two…seeing each other?" Little Shinji said. "I know you guys wanna kiss, right? C'mon!" Little Asuka added.
小小的明日香和真嗣饶有兴致地看着这一幕，“呃……你们俩……是在交往吗？”小真嗣问道。“我知道你们想亲亲，对吧？来吧！”小明日香补充道。

"What you brat…" Asuka hissed, her face turning red, "you brats are too indecent for your age!"
“你们这些小鬼……”明日香低声斥责，脸颊泛红，“你们这个年纪太不检点了！”

"Asuka, actually," Shinji interrupted, "Dr. Akagi said they are apparitions created by our subconscious," Asuka raised an eyebrow at the word 'subconscious'. "So in a way…" His cheeks started heating up.
“明日香，其实，”真嗣插话道，“赤木博士说它们是我们潜意识中产生的幻象，”明日香听到“潜意识”这个词，眉头一挑。“所以从某种意义上说……”他的脸颊开始发烫。

"Wait, you're saying they reflect what we…want?" Asuka's blush deepened, "well, they aren't too far from the truth…" Without another word Asuka pulled a defenseless Shinji into a deep kiss.
"等等，你是说它们反映了我们……想要的？" 明日香的脸上泛起更深的红晕，"嗯，它们倒也不算太离谱……" 话音未落，明日香便一把将毫无防备的真嗣拉入一个深吻之中。

His body fell limp as he felt her push her weight against him, forcing him to lean against the tree while they continued their kiss. He could feel Asuka's tongue playfully dancing with his, and shivers went down his spine when he heard her moan. Slowly the kiss started to die down in intensity, and eventually, the redhead pulled herself away from him, keeping her teeth lightly pressed down on his tongue as she slowly pulled away, making the kiss last as long as possible.
他的身体变得无力，感受到她将重量压向他，迫使他背靠树干，而两人的吻仍在继续。他能感觉到明日香的舌头与他嬉戏般地交缠，当听到她的呻吟时，一阵颤栗沿着脊背而下。渐渐地，这个吻的激烈程度开始减弱，最终，红发的少女从他唇边缓缓抽离，牙齿轻轻压着他的舌头，慢慢拉开距离，尽可能延长这个吻的余韵。

The little Shinji and Asuka watched with satisfactory smiles on both of their faces.
小真嗣和小明日香在一旁观看着，两人的脸上都挂着满意的微笑。

"Interesting, the kids' hormonal levels have just skyrocketed," Naoko Akagi narrowed her eyes, "just what the hell is happening in their dreams?"
有意思，孩子们的荷尔蒙水平刚刚飙升了，" 赤木律子眯起眼睛，"他们梦里到底发生了什么鬼事情？

### Chapter 10: An Angel's Invasion?
天使的入侵？

"Misato…We. Did. Not. Have. Sex," hissed Asuka in exasperation, slamming her hands on the table, "otherwise Kaji would've stopped us, don't you think?!" She glared at the lavender-haired woman intensely, silently cursing the fact that she grew too careless and outed their relationship unintentionally, causing all kinds of inconvenience.
"美里…我们。没。有。发。生。关。系，" 明日香恼怒地低声说道，双手猛地拍在桌上，"否则加持会阻止我们的，你不觉得吗？！" 她怒视着那位紫发女子，心中暗骂自己太过大意，无意中暴露了他们的关系，惹来各种麻烦。

"Asuka, I repeat, I'm not accusing you had sex with Shinji on that specific day," Misato sighed again, "you're seriously trying to convince me that you only came to his room once? Not to mention Dr. Akagi has been detecting abnormally high hormone levels," she rubbed her forehead, "look Asuka…I can accept you two being together, in fact I'm all for you two dating. But sex? You're still too young for that! I need you to tell me the truth!
"明日香，我再说一遍，我不是指责你在那天和真嗣发生了关系，" 美里再次叹息，"你真的想让我相信你只去过他房间一次吗？更别提赤木博士检测到异常高的荷尔蒙水平，" 她揉着额头，"听着，明日香…我能接受你们在一起，事实上我支持你们约会。但性关系？你们还太年轻了！我需要你告诉我真相！

"I am telling the truth!" Asuka groaned in frustration, "what even makes you think that I would just hop into bed with him so quickly?! I have standards!"
我说的就是真相！" 明日香懊恼地呻吟，"你凭什么认为我会那么快就和他上床？！我有我的标准！

"Yeah, but the fact that… you're not a virgin says otherwise!" Misato shot back, "I can trust you on many things, but I can't trust you on this! And I have good reasons, too!"
是，但事实上…你已经不是处女这一点就说明问题了！" 美里反驳道，"在很多事情上我可以信任你，但这件事不行！而且我有充分的理由！

Asuka's retort choked at her throat. How could she forget that? It was one of the most critical moments in her life, and she just didn't remember it? Nonetheless, she had already started to suspect something…the truth behind her first time. "Misato…what do you want me to do, then?" She decided to retreat for the moment and hear out what Misato would want.
明日香的反驳卡在了喉咙里。她怎么能忘记那件事呢？那是她生命中最重要的时刻之一，她竟然记不起来了？尽管如此，她已经开始怀疑…关于她第一次背后的真相。"美里…那你想要我怎么做呢？" 她决定暂时退让，听听美里有什么要求。

"Look, I'm not trying to break up you guys or something," Misato reassured, to which Asuka let out a sigh of relief, "I know you guys had a rough past, so I'm glad you found some happiness. Still," she pondered for a moment; the atmosphere of the room grew increasingly intense as time passed by, "rule number one: no sex allowed!" Asuka nodded halfheartedly. "Rule number two: you can go on dates together, but be sure to come back before 10 p.m.!" Asuka raised an eyebrow but made no comments, "rule number three: sleep on your own beds!"
听着，我不是想拆散你们或者怎样，" 美里安抚道，明日香这才松了口气，"我知道你们过去很艰难，所以很高兴你们找到了一些幸福。不过，" 她沉思了一会儿；随着时间的推移，房间里的气氛变得越来越紧张，"第一条规则：禁止性行为！" 明日香半信半疑地点了点头。"第二条规则：你们可以一起出去约会，但务必在晚上 10 点前回来！" 明日香挑了挑眉，但没有发表意见，"第三条规则：各自睡在自己的床上！

"No way!" Asuka barked, "when I slept with him my nightmares were all gone! I'm not giving this up!"
不可能！" 明日香厉声道，"我跟他睡在一起时，我的噩梦都消失了！我不会放弃这个的！

"Asuka…how can I make sure you won't have sex with him then?" Misato frowned.
"明日香…我怎么才能确保你不会和他发生关系呢？" 美里皱起了眉头。

"Shinji's not gonna take advantage of me! He proved it!" Asuka reasoned.
"真嗣不会占我便宜的！他已经证明了！" 明日香辩解道。

"I'm not worried about him," Misato smirked, leaning forward, her face mere inches from Asuka's. "I'm more worried about you making moves; it's you who hopped into his bed, after all."
我倒不是担心他，" 美里坏笑着，身体前倾，脸几乎贴到了明日香的脸上。"我更担心你主动出击；毕竟，是你跳进了他的床。

Asuka red-faced, "I… it's not what you think! I-" She chose her following words carefully, "I went there for the warmth and company! Not perverted purposes!"
明日香满脸通红，"我…不是你想的那样！我-" 她斟酌着接下来的话，"我去那里是为了温暖和陪伴！不是出于什么下流的目的！"

"How about this?" Misato put a finger under her chin, "I'll let you sleep on the same bed," Asuka's face instantly lit up hearing the words, "but you need to keep the door open. And Kaji will look after you. We can't afford a little surprise 9 months later!"
这个怎么样？" 美里用手指托着下巴，"我让你和他睡同一张床，" 听到这话，明日香的脸上立刻绽放出光彩，"但你们得开着门。而且加持会看着你们的。我们可经不起九个月后的小惊喜！

Asuka closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths, weighing her options. On one side, she could get to sleep next to Shinji – and enjoy the warmth and good dreams. On the other side, she had to give up her privacy, as well as Shinji's. Even though she could live with the arrangement if it meant fantastic nights, it's still not fair to force her will on Shinji. "I'll…ask Shinji about it."
明日香闭上眼睛，深吸了几口气，权衡着利弊。一方面，她可以和真嗣睡在一起——享受温暖和美梦。另一方面，她必须放弃自己的隐私，还有真嗣的。尽管如果这意味着美妙的夜晚，她可以接受这样的安排，但强迫真嗣接受自己的意愿还是不公平的。"我……去问问真嗣吧。"

"Sure," Misato went to the fridge for a beer, "just remember, no sex!"
当然，" 美里走向冰箱拿了一罐啤酒，"但要记住，不许有性行为！

"…so that's what Misato told me," Asuka sighed, resting her head on Shinji's shoulder, who was faintly blushing at the affectionate gesture. "What do you say, Baka?"
……这就是美里告诉我的，" 明日香叹了口气，将头靠在真嗣的肩上，后者因这亲昵的举动而微微脸红。"你怎么说，笨蛋？

"Erm, as long as you're fine with sleeping with doors open, I don't see any problems with that," Shinji replied, lightly brushing the girl's hand, sending jolts of electricity down her spine. "I mean, it's our apartment, it's not like there are strangers…so I guess I'm fine with that."
呃，只要你觉得开着门睡觉没问题，我也没意见，" 真嗣回答道，轻轻拂过女孩的手，让她脊背一阵酥麻。"毕竟这是我们的公寓，又没有外人…所以我觉得可以。

"Alright Baka, if you say so," Asuka snuggled closer to him, "Gods…wait, since we're already blown to Misato, there's no reason to hide from our classmates, right?" She winked at him.
"好吧，笨蛋，既然你这么说，" 明日香向他靠得更近了些，"天哪…等等，既然我们都已经和美里姐坦白了，就没必要再对同学们遮遮掩掩了吧？" 她朝他眨了眨眼。

"I guess… we're already 'an old married couple' to them, anyway…" Shinji sighed, embarrassed as memories of being teased relentlessly resurfaced.
"我想也是…在他们眼里，我们早就是'老夫老妻'了…" 真嗣尴尬地叹了口气，那些被不断调侃的记忆又浮上心头。

"Hmph, then we don't need an official announcement – we just act like one, and when people ask we just tell them the truth that we're indeed together," Asuka suggested, pouting a little, "no need details! Got it? I'm tired of shooing girls away from you!"
哼，那我们就不需要正式宣布了——直接表现得像一对，有人问起就实话实说，我们确实在一起了，" 明日香提议道，微微噘嘴，"不用说细节！明白了吗？我受够了把你身边的女生赶走！

"Right." 对。

The bus halted with a hiss of brakes. Asuka stood up first, Shinji followed just behind, their fingers still intertwined with each other. Their affectionate behavior towards each other had already raised several eyebrows from their schoolmates on the bus; none of them questioned them anything about it, though. Instead, they simply thought, 'the rumor must be true, then.'
公交车伴随着一阵刹车声停了下来。明日香第一个站起来，真嗣紧随其后，两人的手指依旧紧紧相扣。他们对彼此的亲昵举动已经在校车上引来了几道异样的目光；尽管如此，没有人向他们提出任何疑问。大家只是心想，'看来那个传闻是真的了。'

The pair walked into the school gate, hands clasping together. "You ready for this, Shinji?" The boy nodded. Whatever hail of gunfire they were about to face, they would face it together.
两人手牵手走进校门。"你准备好了吗，真嗣？"男孩点了点头。无论即将面对怎样的枪林弹雨，他们都将共同面对。

"I'm…nervous as hell," Shinji took several deep breaths, "I mean…we were pretty friendly to each other already, but this?" He raised his hand with Asuka's together, smiling, "I'm not sure how some people would take it…"
我……紧张得要命，"真嗣深吸了几口气，"我是说……我们之前已经很亲近了，但这样？"他举起与明日香相握的手，微笑着说，"我不确定有些人会怎么看待……

"They can go to hell for all I care," Asuka huffed, "I get to show off my amazing boyfriend, that's all that matters to me!" She smirked, trying to get psyched up.
"他们怎么想关我什么事，"明日香哼了一声，"我就是要炫耀我出色的男朋友，这才是最重要的！"她嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，试图给自己打气。

They marched inside, doing their best to ignore the stares they started to draw from their schoolmates. Rumors were just rumors, there were still loads of boys trying to ask Asuka out on a date or sent her love letters, and girls trying to approach the cute and make-his-own-bentos Shinji, albeit much less in numbers. None of them knew why they've been getting a polite rejection at best, a punch in the face at worst.
他们走进去，尽量不去理会开始吸引同学们目光的注视。谣言终究只是谣言，仍有许多男生试图邀请明日香出去约会或给她写情书，也有女生试图接近可爱的、自己带便当的真嗣，尽管人数少了很多。没有人知道为什么他们得到的最好回应是礼貌的拒绝，最糟的则是一记耳光。

Shinji and Asuka marched into the classroom; At first glance, Mari missed the detail, but she soon settled her eyes on their locking hands; she blinked and went mouth agape instantly. Rei looked at them with a satisfactory smile, happy that she had finally completed 'Lilith's mission', although she didn't really do much. Toji had a look of dawning horror as he noticed their handclasp, while Kensuke – who apparently took a bet with someone - stared at them with a disappointing expression. Hikari, on the other hand, was looking at them intently, her eyes scanning the pair up and down like a radar, trying to find every trace of indecency.
真嗣和明日香走进教室；起初，玛丽没注意到细节，但很快她的目光就落在了他们紧握的手上；她眨了眨眼，立刻张大了嘴巴。绫波带着满意的微笑看着他们，为自己终于完成了“莉莉丝的任务”而高兴，尽管她其实没做什么。东治的表情逐渐变得惊恐，因为他注意到了他们的手牵手，而剑介——显然和某人打了赌——则失望地盯着他们。另一方面，光子则专注地打量着他们，她的眼睛像雷达一样上下扫描这对情侣，试图找出每一丝不妥之处。

The Children went to their respective seats, their hands let go of each other until the last moment. Waves of murmurs and whispers rippled through the classroom, to which Shinji and Asuka couldn't help but enjoy, their lips curling into smiles.
孩子们各自走向座位，手直到最后一刻才松开。教室里涌起阵阵窃窃私语，真嗣和明日香不禁享受其中，嘴角勾起微笑。

Asuka opened her laptop, just like she predicted, loads of PMs flooded the IM application. She could say the same was happening to Shinji, judging from his expression and furious mouse-clicking.
明日香打开笔记本电脑，如她所料，即时通讯软件中涌入了大量私信。从真嗣的表情和急促的鼠标点击来看，他那边的情况应该也差不多。

'Not as bad as I thought,' Asuka mused, 'I was totally expecting a reaction more…explosive. Perhaps we were really acting like a couple already.' "Called it!" came Mari's excited voice from the back row, who was noticeably collecting several bets, "it was never a rumor! I saw right through them in the beginning!"
“没我想象的那么糟，”明日香暗自思忖，“我本以为反应会更……激烈些。或许我们真的已经像情侣一样行事了。”“我猜对了！”后排传来真希波兴奋的声音，她正明显地在收取几笔赌注，“这从来就不是谣言！我一开始就看穿了他们！”

Asuka leaned back on her seat, stretching her arms. Her eyes wandered right where Shinji sat, and the said boy was looking at her, smiling – the affectionate smile people use when they saw something they love. Asuka couldn't suppress her own loving smile, to which Shinji's smile widened into a grin.
明日香靠在椅背上，伸展双臂。她的目光游移到真嗣所在的位置，而那个男孩正望着她，微笑着——那种看到所爱之物时人们会露出的深情微笑。明日香抑制不住自己的爱意微笑，真嗣的笑容也随之扩大成咧嘴笑。

Asuka bit her lips, summoning all of her willpower not to throw herself on Shinji and begin kissing him senselessly; she pointed at Shinji's laptop then her own, the said boy immediately understood her purpose and sent her a message.
明日香咬着嘴唇，竭尽全力克制自己扑向真嗣并开始毫无理智地亲吻他的冲动；她指向真嗣的笔记本电脑，然后指向自己的，那个男孩立刻明白了她的意图，并向她发送了一条消息。

Shinji S.: yes, Asuka? 真嗣 S.: 怎么了，明日香？

Asuka S.: you know, since we're official now, I'm thinking about a date.
明日香 S.: 你知道的，既然我们现在正式了，我在想我们该去约会了。

Asuka could hear Shinji gasp in surprise. She grinned and continued typing.
明日香能听到真嗣惊讶的吸气声。她咧嘴一笑，继续打字。

Asuka S.: What do you say?
明日香 S.: 你怎么说？

Shinji S.: I'd love to, Asuka.
真嗣 S.: 我很愿意，明日香。

Shinji S. What's the plan?
真嗣 S.: 有什么计划吗？

Asuka sighed, Asuka S.: C'mon! I already asked you out. It's your job to pick up places!
明日香叹了口气，明日香 S.: 拜托！我都主动约你了，选地方该你来啊！

Shinji S.: But I don't have any experience, nor knowledge! I can try, but I can't promise it's good!
真嗣 S.: 但我既没有经验，也不懂什么知识！我可以试试，但不能保证做得好！

Asuka S.: I've never been on a date before as well, maybe I did but I forgot. So technically you can't screw it up by comparison
明日香 S.: 我也没真正约会过，或许有过但我忘了。所以严格来说，你也不可能比这更糟了。

Shinji S.: Well, is the classic lunch and a movie acceptable
真嗣 S.: 那么，传统的午餐加电影行得通吗？

Asuka S.: I prefer a movie first, then we'll have something to talk to during dinner
明日香 S.: 我更倾向于先看电影，这样晚餐时就有话题可聊了。

Shinji S.: Alright. Movie and dinner they are
碇真嗣：好的，那就电影加晚餐吧。

Asuka S.: You'd better pick somewhere other than PizzaHut this time. I can't wait to see what's your so-called 'high-end restaurant where all the couples go to'!
惣流·明日香·兰格雷：这次你最好别再选必胜客了。我倒要看看你说的所谓“情侣们都去的高档餐厅”是什么样的！

Shinji coughed, Shinji S.: You still remember that?!
碇真嗣咳嗽一声，碇真嗣：那事儿你还记得啊？！

Asuka S.: That day's never gonna leave my memory
惣流·明日香·兰格雷：那天的记忆我可忘不了。

Asuka S.: BTW, what's for lunch today
明日香 S.: 对了，今天午餐吃什么？

Shinji S.: bratwurst with sauerkraut
真嗣 S.: 烤香肠配酸菜

Asuka licked her lips, Asuka S.: good
明日香舔了舔嘴唇，明日香 S.: 不错

"Rise! Bow! Sit!" Hikari Horaki called out as Sensei came into the classroom, interrupting Shinji and Asuka's little chat. The Sensei went on talking about how the world has changed after the Financial Crisis. Shinji sighed in impatience and decided to use the time for a better cause – make sure Asuka would enjoy their first real date.
"起立！鞠躬！坐下！" 班长光博拉奇在老师走进教室时喊道，打断了真嗣和明日香的小对话。老师接着谈论起金融危机后世界的变化。真嗣不耐烦地叹了口气，决定利用这段时间做些更有意义的事——确保明日香能享受他们的第一次真正约会。

XXXXXX

Sunday Afternoon 周日下午

After his fourth failed attempt, Shinji was now thoroughly convinced that the woman invented the tie as revenge for men. He wore tan dress pants with a light-blue sleeve shirt, and a god damned tie. He never thought about wearing something so formal to a date, however when he called the Italian restaurant for a reservation, they told him he needs to suit up. Thankfully Asuka had bought him several sets of formal wear.
在第四次尝试失败后，真嗣彻底相信那个女人发明领带是为了报复男人。他穿着棕色正装裤和浅蓝色衬衫，还有那该死的领带。他从没想过要穿得这么正式去约会，但当他打电话给那家意大利餐厅预订时，他们告诉他必须穿正装。幸好明日香给他买了几套正装。

Asuka, on the other hand, wore a simple yellow sundress – barely meeting the request of the restaurant. With her sweet smile and sparkling blue eyes she was absolutely radiant.
而明日香则穿了一件简单的黄色太阳裙——勉强符合餐厅的要求。她甜美的笑容和闪烁的蓝眼睛让她光彩照人。

"Wow," Shinji tried to find some appropriate words, "you look…angelic, oh no," he waved his hand, "not a shito, but an angel!"
哇，"真嗣试图找到合适的词，"你看起来……像天使，哦不，"他挥了挥手，"不是恶魔，是天使！

Asuka giggled, "Baka," she shook her head contrasted by her sweet smile, "you're looking handsome yourself." True to her words, Shinji in formal wear definitely made him look more like a real man.
明日香咯咯笑道：“笨蛋，”她摇头否认，甜美的笑容与之形成对比，“你自己也挺帅的嘛。”确实，穿上正装的真嗣，无疑更显男子气概。

"You guys look really cute together," Misato remarked with a smile on her face, "just remember the rules! Asuka, do you mind repeating them?"
“你们俩看起来真般配，”美里微笑着说，“不过别忘了规矩哦！明日香，不介意再重复一遍吧？”

"Yeah, yeah. No sex allowed, and come back before 10 p.m.," Asuka sighed with resignation, "rest assured, we'll give you and Kaji enough time to have fun by yourselves!" Her dejected expression turned into a teasing smirk.
“知道啦知道啦。禁止亲密行为，十点前回家。”明日香无奈地叹了口气，“放心吧，我们会给足你和加持先生独处的时间的！”她那沮丧的表情瞬间转为戏谑的坏笑。

"Just…shut it, alright?!" Misato blushed, much to Asuka's satisfaction, "have fun! See you tonight!" She said, waving goodbye to the Children.
“就……别说了，行不行？！”美里脸颊泛红，这让明日香颇为得意，“玩得开心点！晚上见！”她向孩子们挥手告别。

The duo exited the apartment and came to the side of a rather busy road, holding hands all the way. They had been so lonely for their entire life; therefore, they both needed constant body contact as an assurance. It was when Shinji needed to use both of his hands to type on his Samsung they let go of each other, albeit reluctantly. Shinji opened Uber app and called a taxi; they never thought life could be so convenient with the help of technology.
两人走出公寓，来到一条颇为繁忙的路边，一路手牵手。他们一生都如此孤独，因此彼此都需要持续的身体接触作为慰藉。直到真嗣需要用双手在三星手机上打字时，他们才不情愿地松开了手。真嗣打开 Uber 应用叫了辆出租车，他们从未想过有了科技的帮助，生活竟能如此便捷。

The cinema was supposed to be merely 15 minutes of driving away, so when 30 minutes passed and the cinema was still nowhere in sight, the Children began to worry. Then they remembered their hilarious mistake: the cinema was indeed 15 minutes of driving away – just by Misato's standards – which the Children forgot to take into account.
电影院本应只需驱车 15 分钟便可到达，因此当 30 分钟过去，电影院仍不见踪影时，孩子们开始焦虑起来。这时他们才想起自己那滑稽的错误：电影院确实只需 15 分钟车程——按美里姐的标准——而他们却忘了这一点。

They were almost late for the film, and Asuka suffered a lot while running on high heels. She made a mental note to herself that she would prank the poor boy later as a revenge, although herself was also part of the blame for the incident.
他们差点错过了电影，明日香穿着高跟鞋奔跑时吃了不少苦头。她在心里暗暗记下，回头一定要捉弄一下那个可怜的男孩作为报复，尽管自己也是这场事故的共犯。

Both Children were panting heavily when they finally reached the counter. The ticket clerk gave them a knowing smile, "Good afternoon, miss, mister. How can I help you?"
当两人终于气喘吁吁地赶到售票处时，售票员给了他们一个会心的微笑，“下午好，小姐，先生。有什么可以帮到您们的？”

"I bought the tickets online," Shinji took out his phone, "let me show you the QR code…" he tapped on his phone several times, bringing up the QR code quite skillfully. He must've been learning how to handle these high-tech devices.
"我在网上买的票，" 真嗣掏出手机，"我给你看下二维码……" 他轻点几下屏幕，熟练地调出了二维码。看来他最近在如何操作这些高科技设备上下了不少功夫。

The ticket clerk took out a scanner and scanned the code, "hmm… you're a bit late. Not a big deal, it's still playing the trailers," he handed the Children their tickets and smiled a professional smile, "hope you have fun!"
售票员拿出扫描器，扫了一下码，"嗯……你们来得有点晚。不过没关系，现在还在放预告片，" 他递给孩子们票，并露出职业性的微笑，"希望你们玩得开心！"

Asuka grabbed the ticket and tried to comprehend the text on it; her Kanji reading skills had been improving a lot since Shinji started giving her private tutoring. With that being said, she still preferred an English menu when ordering. "Erm, what is this? Death…pool…DEADPOOL?!" Asuka cried incredulously, "seriously Shinji, isn't this kind of a movie you watch with your buddies, not your girlfriend?!"
明日香抓过票，努力辨认上面的文字；自从真嗣开始给她补习后，她的汉字阅读能力提高了不少。尽管如此，点餐时她还是更喜欢英文菜单。"呃，这是什么？死亡……池……死侍？！" 明日香难以置信地喊道，"认真的吗，真嗣，这种电影不是应该和哥们儿看，而不是和女朋友看吗？！"

Shinji red-faced in embarrassment, "well… you're not very…girl-ish, so I reckon this may work just fine…I mean, it has good reviews, and I want our first date to be…special, so instead of romance comedies I chose a humor action movie. The trailer really hooks me…"
真嗣尴尬得满脸通红，"那个……你不是很……女孩子气，所以我觉得这个应该也行……我的意思是，它评价很好，而且我希望我们的第一次约会能……特别一点，所以没选爱情喜剧，而是选了这部幽默动作片。预告片真的很吸引我……"

Asuka waved in dismissal, "whatever. We don't have time to argue. Deadpool it is."
明日香摆手表示不在意，“随便吧。我们没时间争论了。就死侍吧。”

"Doctor Strange…looks fun," Asuka commented, "Marvel studios, huh… I've seen its manga in the United States…but never heard of it making movies. I guess the absence of Second Impact really changed more than I expected."
“奇异博士……看起来挺有意思的，”明日香评论道，“漫威工作室，是吧……我在美国看过它的漫画……但从没听说它拍过电影。看来第二次冲击的缺席真的改变了我预料之外的更多事情。”

"Good change, or bad change?" Shinji asked.
“是好的改变，还是坏的改变？”真嗣问道。

"Good changes, of course," said Asuka, taking a sip of the cherry coke she decided to try for the first time, "eek! Gross! I really have no idea how this is so popular!" She forced herself to swallow the liquid, "Shinji, gimme your water! I need to wash off the taste!"
“当然是好的改变，”明日香说着，抿了一口她第一次尝试的樱桃可乐，“哎呀！好难喝！我真不明白这东西怎么这么受欢迎！”她勉强咽下液体，“真嗣，把你的水给我！我得冲掉这味道！”

Shinji gave her his mineral water, who took a large gulp, "well, you can keep my water if you want… I'll just drink the cherry coke…"
真嗣把自己的矿泉水递给她，她大口喝了起来，“嗯，你要是愿意，我的水就留给你吧…我喝樱桃可乐就行…”

Asuka smiled a warm smile, "Ba-ka. We can share! I don't mind. We've already kissed, so who cares?" And she proved it by pulling him into a soft kiss, who reciprocated with equal passion.
明日香露出了温暖的微笑，“笨蛋。我们可以一起喝啊！我不介意的。我们都亲过嘴了，谁还在乎这个？”她边说边拉过他，给了他一个温柔的吻，而他同样热情地回应了她。

XX

"Wait, they make new STAR TREK movies?!" Asuka managed to shout in a whisper, "the original ones were sooooo good! I can't wait to see the new ones!"
“等等，他们还在拍新的《星际迷航》电影？！”明日香压低声音惊呼道，“原版的简直太棒了！我迫不及待想看新片了！”

"Well, they're releasing it several months later, we can go watch it then…" Shinji replied, "but I haven't seen the old ones, so I'm probably going to be very lost…"
“嗯，电影还要过几个月才上映，到时候我们可以去看…”真嗣回答说，“不过我还没看过老片子，估计到时候会一头雾水…”

"No big deal. We'll watch them toge-" Asuka's eyes widened as she saw the title of the movie in the next trailer, "THEY ALSO HAVE FUCKING NEW STAR WARS MOVIES?!" She exclaimed, her volume just loud enough to disturb people who sat near them. She looked around with an apologetic look; the people who turned their heads in their direction shook it off as they saw they were only kids. "Shinji! I want to see that as well!" She added in a whisper.
"没什么大不了的。我们看着他们一起——" 当明日香看到下一个预告片中的电影标题时，她的眼睛瞪大了，"他们居然还有新的《星球大战》电影？！" 她惊呼道，音量刚好大到足以打扰到坐在附近的人。她环顾四周，露出歉意的表情；那些转头看向他们的人，见只是几个孩子，便没再计较。"真嗣！我也想看那个！" 她低声补充道。

"No problem, and I guess I need to watch the old Star Wars movies with you as well?" He asked in a half-amused, half-dreading tone.
"没问题，我想我也得陪你一起看老的《星球大战》电影了？" 他半开玩笑半担忧地问道。

"Got any problem with that? You got to spend time with me," Asuka huffed.
"有意见吗？你能和我一起度过时光，" 明日香哼了一声。

"Just being around you makes me happy, Asuka," Shinji said softly.
"只要在你身边，我就感到幸福，明日香，" 真嗣轻声说道。

"Hmph, you always choose inappropriate times to say sappy words," Asuka blushed a faint blush, "but don't you stop." She smiled and grabbed his hand, intertwining their fingers.
"哼，你总挑不对时机说些肉麻话，" 明日香脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，"不过别停。" 她微笑着抓住他的手，十指紧扣。

"Okay…he… that's so sad," Asuka sighed, "seriously? He got diagnosed with terminal cancer on the same day his girlfriend accepted his marriage proposal? That's…" she trailed off as she recalled that day…the day she was chosen to be a pilot, the simultaneously happiest and scariest day in her life. She shook her head; after her talk with Mrs. Soryu, she'd already moved on from her past. There's no need to brooding on it anymore.
"唉……他……真让人难过，" 明日香叹了口气，"真的吗？他在同一天被诊断出晚期癌症，而他的女友接受了他的求婚？这……" 她话音渐弱，回想起那一天……她被选为驾驶员的那天，生命中最快乐也最恐惧的一天。她摇了摇头；与索留香夫人交谈后，她已经从过去走了出来。没必要再沉溺其中了。

"Well, I only hope this won't happen to me…" Shinji said in an unreadable tone.
"嗯，我只希望这种事别发生在我身上……" 真嗣的语气难以捉摸。

"We'll…get there, alright?" Asuka squeezed his hand, "I mean, the proposal, not cancer!"
我们会……到那一步的，好吗？" 明日香紧握他的手，"我是说求婚，不是癌症！

Shinji blinked, "wh-what? You…you are thinking about…marriage? Us?"
真嗣眨了眨眼，“什、什么？你……你在考虑……结婚？我们？”

Asuka frowned, "darling, I get it that we're still too young for it, but there's no one else in the world I want to spend the rest of my life with," she leaned on Shinji's shoulder, "unless…you disagree?" Her tone carried a tinge of threat and worry.
明日香皱起眉头，“亲爱的，我知道我们还太年轻，但世界上没有其他人我想与之共度余生，”她靠在真嗣的肩上，“除非……你不同意？”她的语气中带着一丝威胁和忧虑。

"I…you can say the same for me, Asuka." Shinji replied, "I want to be with you for the rest of my life as well… it's just…it scares me. Thinking about future, I mean."
“我……对你来说也一样，明日香。”真嗣回答道，“我也想和你共度余生……只是……这让我害怕。我是说，想到未来。”

Asuka smiled a satisfactory smile, "I'll hold you onto that. Don't you ever leave me, or I'll kill you."
明日香露出了满意的微笑，“我会记住你这句话的。你永远别想离开我，否则我会杀了你。”

"I would never." 我绝不会。

XX

"Okay… that's so funny," Asuka managed to say between her jolts of laughter, "hahaha…I was wondering how he got his made-up name…hahaha…"
好吧…真是太逗了，" 明日香在笑声的间隙中勉强说出，"哈哈哈…我还在想他那编造的名字是怎么来的…哈哈哈…

"Well, this movie is comedic," Shinji remarked.
"嗯，这部电影挺搞笑的，" 真嗣评论道。

XX

"So his body regenerates…does that mean he couldn't die from cancer?" Asuka asked, putting a handful of popcorn into her mouth.
"那他的身体能再生…是不是意味着他不会死于癌症？" 明日香问道，同时往嘴里塞了一把爆米花。

"Maybe? I guess?" Shinji said in a non-committal way.
"或许吧？可能吧？" 真嗣以一种模棱两可的方式说道。

"Whatever. Just watch the film."
随便了。就看电影吧。

XX

"So he still got to see his girlfriend in the end," said Asuka with a smirk on her face, standing up from the seat, "and they reconciled. Good." She shot Shinji a half-threatening glare, "though if you ever dare leave me like that, I will never forgive you."
所以，他最后还是见到了他的女朋友，" 明日香带着一丝戏谑的笑容站起身来，"而且他们和好了。挺好的。" 她向真嗣投去半是威胁的目光，"不过，你要是敢那样离开我，我绝对不会原谅你。

"I know," Shinji smiled and gave her hand a gentle squeeze, "so, what do you think of the movie?" Shinji asked hesitantly, standing up as well.
"我知道，" 真嗣微笑着，轻轻握了握她的手，"那么，你觉得这部电影怎么样？" 真嗣也站起身来，有些迟疑地问道。

"Actually, it's surprisingly fun," Asuka stretched her arms, "not a bad choice. Not bad at all."
其实，这出乎意料地有趣呢，" 明日香伸了个懒腰，"选得不错。真不错。

"I'm glad you liked it, Asuka," Shinji mentally let out a sigh of relief, "I enjoyed it myself."
很高兴你喜欢，明日香，" 真嗣心里松了口气，"我自己也挺享受的。

"So what's next? Where's the fancy restaurant you're gonna impress me with?" Asuka asked, clapping her hands together in anticipation.
"那接下来呢？你要带我去哪家高档餐厅让我大开眼界啊？" 明日香拍手期待地问道。

"It's not far away from here, we can walk there if you want," Shinji looked at the Google maps on his phone, "it says 10 minutes of walking distance. Is that okay for you?"
离这儿不远，如果你想的话，我们可以走着去，" 真嗣看着手机上的谷歌地图，"显示步行只需十分钟。你觉得呢？

"No problem. I've been through combat training, a little walk is nothing."
没问题。我接受过战斗训练，走点路算什么。

By happenstance, their arrival at the Italian restaurant was timed perfectly, they got to sit at the window seat since another couple just left there. The front desk's attitude was professional but carried a tinge of dismissal at first, but wisely switched to a courteous manner as soon as he saw their Gehirn ID cards. The waiter took their drink orders: Shinji ordered a glass of red wine for both of them under Asuka's persistence. He was never a big fan of drinking; in fact, he was surprised that the waiter just accepted his order. Still, Asuka could be convincing when she set her mind.
巧合的是，他们到达意大利餐厅的时间恰到好处，因为另一对情侣刚离开，他们得以坐在窗边的位置。前台起初态度专业却略带轻视，但一看到他们的 Gehirn 身份证，便明智地转为恭敬有礼。服务员接过他们的饮品订单：在明日香的坚持下，真嗣为他们俩点了一杯红酒。他向来不怎么喜欢喝酒，事实上，服务员直接接受他的订单让他有些惊讶。不过，明日香一旦下定决心，说服力还是很强的。

The Children surveyed their menus, deciding what to order for dinner. Asuka considered a Fiorentina Steak, but soon rejected the idea since it was too much meat. "I want to get the steak but it'll make me fat," she pouted.
孩子们审视着菜单，决定晚餐吃什么。明日香考虑过佛罗伦萨牛排，但很快因为肉太多而否决了这个想法。"我想吃牛排，但那会让我变胖，"她噘着嘴说。

"Really? I thought steak doesn't have much fat in it," Shinji replied, before a smirk showed up on his face, "the way you work out the only thing that will make you fat is me." He retorted jokingly.
"真的吗？我以为牛排脂肪不多呢，"真嗣回答道，随后脸上露出一丝坏笑，"照你锻炼的那个劲头，唯一能让你变胖的只有我了。"他打趣地反驳道。

"Hmph," Asuka squeezed his hand across the table, "still, I think Lasagna is a better choice."
哼，" 明日香隔着桌子紧握他的手，"不过，我还是觉得千层面是更好的选择。

"Whatever makes you happy," Shinji said, turning his attention back to the menu, "hmm…this Ossobuco looks tasty. I want this."
只要你开心就好，" 真嗣说着，又将注意力转回到菜单上，"嗯……这个炖小牛膝看起来不错。我要这个。

The waiter took their order and left with a professional smile. Moments later he came back with the drinks, Shinji lifted his glass of red wine, frowning, "Asuka, you sure this is a good idea?"
服务员记下他们的点单，带着职业的微笑离开了。片刻后他带着饮料回来，真嗣举起他的红酒杯，皱着眉头，"明日香，你确定这是个好主意吗？"

"Trust me, alright," Asuka took a sip with a dewy look in her eyes; the liquid stayed in her mouth as she tasted it before gulping it down, "hmm…Oooo, this is strong," she remarked, the smell of alcohol coming up to her nasal cavity.
"相信我，没问题的，" 明日香抿了一口，眼中闪烁着湿润的光芒；她让酒液在口中停留品味了一会儿才咽下，"嗯……哦，这酒劲儿挺大，" 她评论道，酒精的气味随之涌入她的鼻腔。

Shinji looked at the drink nervously, then looked at Asuka who was smiling encouragingly; he took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, and took a sip. The flavor bloomed on his taste buds – bitter, hot, and a little bit of sweetness – he felt a gush of alcohol surging up to his head, making him positively dizzy, his cheeks started heating up.
真嗣紧张地看着那杯饮料，然后望向微笑鼓励他的明日香；他深吸一口气，缓缓呼出，然后抿了一口。味道在他的味蕾上绽放——苦涩、热辣，还带着一丝甜意——他感到一股酒精直冲脑门，让他有些晕眩，双颊开始发热。

Asuka watched his reaction with amusement, "Ba-ka. That's your drinking capacity?" She took a big gulp herself like drinking water, wiping her mouth, "see? It's nothing." She grinned an ear-to-ear grin, her cheeks turning pink as well.
明日香饶有兴致地观察着他的反应，“笨蛋。这就是你的酒量？”她自己大口喝下，就像喝水一样，擦了擦嘴，“看吧？没什么大不了的。”她咧嘴笑得合不拢嘴，双颊也泛起了粉红。

The waiter came with their meals, placing the plates on the table. Asuka picked up the knife and cut off a small part of her Lasagna, putting it into her mouth using the fork. "Hmm…this is good," she looked at Shinji expectantly, "I want this at home. Can you learn the recipe for me?" She asked, her eyes shining with anticipation – a look that melted Shinji's heart.
服务员端来了他们的餐点，将盘子放在桌上。明日香拿起刀叉，切下一小块千层面，用叉子送入口中。“嗯……这个真好吃，”她期待地看着真嗣，“我想在家里也能吃到。你能学这个菜谱给我做吗？”她问道，眼中闪烁着期待的光芒——那眼神让真嗣的心都融化了。

"S-sure, Asuka," Shinji replied with a loving smile, caught her hand, and gave it a squeeze before letting it go, "anything for you."
“当、当然，明日香，”真嗣带着宠溺的微笑回答，握住她的手，轻轻捏了一下后放开，“为你做什么都行。”

Asuka turned her head away and blinked away the tears. Crying in public was not an option, no matter how her hand burned after this minimal contact; grabbing and kissing him right now was also not an–
明日香转过头去，眨眼间泪水便消失了。在公众场合哭泣绝非明智之举，无论这次轻微接触后她的手有多么灼痛；此刻抓住他并吻上去同样不可取——

'What's the worst outcome? We're in a romantic restaurant, after all,' Asuka reasoned before setting up her mind. She stood up from her seat and leaned forward while lifting Shinji up from his seat as well, pulling him into a kiss.
“最坏的结果又能怎样？毕竟我们身处一家浪漫的餐厅。”明日香思忖着下定决心。她从座位上站起身，倾身向前，同时将真嗣也从座位上拉起，两人随即拥吻在一起。

Shinji blinked; having Asuka's lips – and teeth, and tongue – on his was more recent, but a recognizable sensation. Still, the whole situation felt bizarre, most likely due to its suddenness and surprise. His heart was pounding, his body tensed-
真嗣眨了眨眼，明日香的唇——连同牙齿和舌头——触碰他的感觉虽是新近之事，却也熟悉。然而，整个场景仍显得异常怪异，多半是因为这突如其来和出乎意料的缘故。他的心跳加速，身体紧绷——

Asuka then let out a series of content moans.
随后，明日香发出了一连串满足的呻吟。

Shinji relaxed and returned the kiss with passion.
真嗣放松下来，热情地回应了那个吻。

"Aah," Asuka moaned again as she detached herself from him. "Just what I needed. Thank you for providing", she grinned.
"啊哈，" 明日香再次呻吟着，从他身上抽离。"正是我需要的。谢谢你提供，" 她咧嘴笑道。

"Well…that was…unexpected, but really peasant," Shinji's head was still high on alcohol and hormones.
"嗯……那真是……出乎意料，但又非常愉快，" 真嗣的脑袋还沉浸在酒精和荷尔蒙的余韵中。

The duo returned to their meal with content smiles on their faces, enjoying the companionable silence. Asuka raised the wineglass to Shinji, "thank you for the best first date any woman could ask for."
两人带着满足的微笑回到餐桌上，享受着默契的宁静。明日香举起酒杯向真嗣致意，"谢谢你，这是我作为女人能想象到的最美好的初次约会。"

"I'm just glad you're enjoying it," he answered sheepishly and sipped his red wine.
"我只是很高兴你喜欢，"他腼腆地回答，并啜饮了一口红酒。

The waiter came around to take their dessert order of chocolate ice cream and box up their leftovers. The bill arrived with the desert and Shinji mentally calculated the tip leaving his Gehirn credit card with it. Together they enjoyed the last drinking of their red wine and the smooth chilly flavor of the ice cream.
服务员过来为他们点了一份巧克力冰淇淋，并打包了剩余的食物。账单随甜点一同送达，真嗣在心里计算了小费，留下他的 Gehirn 信用卡。两人一同享受着最后一口红酒和冰淇淋的顺滑冰凉口感。

Their first date was just getting better and better.
他们的初次约会正变得越来越美好。

On the walk home, Asuka looked like she had a lot on her mind. Her eyes kept wandering up and down, occasionally looking at her watch, her hands clasping together behind her back. It was when they came in front of an unrecognizable hotel Shinji finally noticed they were already not on the way home anymore. "Asuka?" Shinji asked as he saw Asuka stopped walking in front of the hotel, wondering what could she be planning on, "this is not the way home-"
回家的路上，明日香似乎心事重重。她的目光不时上下游移，偶尔瞥一眼手表，双手背在身后紧握。直到他们站在一家陌生的酒店前，真嗣才意识到他们早已偏离了回家的路。"明日香？"真嗣见明日香在酒店前停下脚步，不禁疑惑她有何打算，"这不是回家的路——"

"I know," Asuka took a deep breath, fixing her gaze on Shinji's eyes, her voice hazy, "I'm thinking…we could…" she looked at her watch again, "it's only 8 p.m., we still have two hours. It's more than enough-"
我知道，" 明日香深吸一口气，目光坚定地凝视着真嗣的眼睛，声音带着一丝朦胧，"我在想……我们可以……" 她再次看了看手表，"现在才晚上八点，我们还有两个小时。时间绰绰有余——

"Asuka?!" Shinji frowned, putting his hands on the redhead's shoulders, "what are you up to?"
明日香？！" 真嗣皱起眉头，双手搭在红发少女的肩上，"你这是要做什么？

"I've been thinking about this for a while, Shinji," Asuka put her right hand on Shinji's chest, her left hand on his cheek, caressing it with love, her eyes full of lust, "I-I want you, in bed," she said, "I'm really happy today, and I'm happy just around you," she kept going, her hands continued to caress, "you're the only one in this world who could understand me and accept me for who I really am, so I want the deepest bond possible between us," she trailed off, waiting for a reply.
"我考虑这件事已经有一阵子了，真嗣，" 明日香将右手放在真嗣的胸前，左手轻抚他的脸颊，满含爱意地摩挲着，眼中闪烁着渴望，"我……我想要你，在床上，" 她说道，"今天我真的很开心，只要有你在身边我就感到幸福，" 她的双手继续温柔地抚摸，"你是这个世界上唯一能理解我、接纳真实自我的那个人，所以我渴望我们之间能有最深切的联系，" 她停顿下来，等待着回应。

"Wh-what?" He stammered; as dense as he was, Asuka's intention couldn't be more direct to him. "Are you seriously suggesting that…we could…" He winked at the hotel.
"什……什么？" 他结巴着；尽管迟钝，明日香的意图对他来说再明显不过。"你真的在提议……我们可以……" 他瞥了一眼酒店。

"Yes," Asuka's reply was instant, "we can get some protection easily from the counter…so nothing can stop us."
是的，"明日香立刻回答，"我们可以轻易地从柜台那里得到一些保护措施……所以没有什么能阻止我们。

Shinji – no matter how well-mannered he was, he was still a teenage boy, controlled by hormones – not to mention the effect of alcohol. He looked into Asuka's eyes, they were full of love, lust, and expectations. How could a man refuse such a request from his lady?
无论真嗣多么有礼貌，他毕竟还是个受荷尔蒙驱使的青春期少年——更别提酒精的影响了。他凝视着明日香的眼睛，那里充满了爱意、欲望和期待。面对心爱之人的请求，哪个男人能拒绝呢？

He leaned forward; Asuka smiled and puckered up, letting out a content exhale-
他倾身向前；明日香微笑着撅起嘴唇，满意地呼出一口气——

It took only a fraction of a second for Shinji's brain to register the smell – alcohol. He stopped dead in the tracks, his reason and self-restraint coming back. "No," he said firmly, pulling away from the redhead.
真嗣的大脑只用了不到一秒的时间就识别出了那个气味——酒精。他顿时停住，理智和自制力重新回归。"不行，"他坚决地说，从红发女孩身边抽身离开。

A series of emotions went through Asuka's face – confusion, anger, hurt – her face darkened and she took a step back, "you…you don't want me," she murmured, tears threatening to come out of the corner of her eyes.
一连串的情绪掠过明日香的脸庞——困惑、愤怒、受伤——她的脸色阴沉下来，后退了一步，“你……你不想要我，”她低声说道，泪水在眼角处蓄势待发。

"Asuka…listen," Shinji stepped forward and pulled her into a hug, whose body was tense and not returning the embrace, "you're drunk. We're drunk. If we do this now I'd be taking advantage of you, and you'd probably regret it in the morning, then I would never be able to forgive myself," he whispered into her ear softly, "I-I want you, I really do," he added, Asuka's body started to relax, "I-I've been thinking about it, too," he blushed, "during the nights," he blurted out; his blush turned incandescent as his brain registered his words, "so-sorry! I mean-"
“明日香……听着，”真嗣上前一步，将她拥入怀中，她的身体紧绷着，没有回应这个拥抱，“你醉了。我们都醉了。如果现在这么做，我会是在占你便宜，而你明早可能会后悔，那样我将永远无法原谅自己，”他轻声在她耳边低语，“我-我想要你，真的，”他补充道，明日香的身体开始放松，“我-我也一直在想这件事，”他脸红着说，“在夜里，”他脱口而出；当他的大脑意识到自己的话时，他的脸红得发烫，“对-对不起！我是说——”

Asuka let out a chuckle with a sob, pulling her arms up to Shinji's waist, embracing him, "don't apologize," she cut him off. Shinji had no idea how much better his words had made Asuka feel, "I know what you mean. And I'm okay with that," she added, blushing a little herself. "Actually, I'd be offended if you didn't." Her voice suddenly sorrowful, "Gott… I'm such a slut," she sobbed, "I'm not even a virgin… I'm sorry, I-"
明日香带着哭腔轻笑一声，双臂环抱住真嗣的腰，紧紧拥抱着他，“别道歉，”她打断他。真嗣并不知道自己的话让明日香感觉好多了，“我明白你的意思。我接受，”她补充道，脸上泛起一丝红晕。“其实，如果你不这么做，我反而会生气。”她的声音突然变得悲伤，“上帝啊…我真是个荡妇，”她抽泣着，“我甚至不是处女了…对不起，我——”

She was cut off by a finger on her lips. Shinji let out a sigh mixed with relief and dread, "Asuka…speaking of which… there's something I need to tell you," he took a deep breath, pulling away from the hug so that he could look into Asuka's shining blue eyes, "please don't be mad at me."
她的话被一根手指轻轻按在唇上打断。真嗣发出一声夹杂着释然与恐惧的叹息，“明日香…说到这个…我有件事必须告诉你，”他深吸一口气，从拥抱中抽身，以便能直视明日香那闪烁的蓝眼睛，“请不要生我的气。”

"What? That you had sex with someone else before?" Suddenly her voice turned aggressive and threatening.
“什么？难道你之前和别人有过关系？”突然间，她的声音变得充满敌意和威胁。

"You're not exactly wrong," he started, his blush returning, Asuka's gaze intensified by an exponential, "my first time…was you, Asuka," she raised an eyebrow, "just like…your first time was me."
“你这么说也没错，”他开口道，脸颊再次泛红，明日香的目光愈发锐利，“我的第一次…是你，明日香，”她挑起眉毛，“就像…你的第一次也是我。”

Asuka blinked in surprise – she then frowned, her eyes narrowing, "what…how?" She finally managed to articulate.
明日香惊讶地眨了眨眼——随后皱起眉头，目光锐利，“什么…怎么回事？”她终于勉强挤出这句话。

"Someone else told me, in my dream," Shinji confessed, "there was a self-claimed prophesier, he said we were…in a relationship when we were EVA pilots," he trailed off, not sure whether he would be dead the next second.
“是梦里有人告诉我的，”真嗣坦白道，“有个自称预言家的人说，我们曾是 EVA 驾驶员时就…有过一段关系，”他话音渐弱，不确定下一秒自己是否还能活着。

Asuka pondered for a moment, "well, there was some weird person in my dream as well, so I guess it could also happen to you," she then recalled her realistic wet dreams, her eyes widened as realization dawned on her. "Oh Gott…now I know…those dreams, they weren't dreams, they were…my memories," her shocked expression suddenly turned into a grin.
明日香沉思片刻，“嗯，我梦里也出现过奇怪的人，所以你遇到这种事也不奇怪，”她随即回想起那些逼真的梦境，眼睛瞪大，恍然大悟。“哦，天哪…现在我知道了…那些梦，它们不是梦，它们是…我的记忆，”她震惊的表情突然转为一抹笑意。

"Asuka… you're not mad at me?" Shinji asked cautiously.
“明日香…你不生我的气吗？”真嗣小心翼翼地问道。

"Of course not!" Asuka exclaimed in joy, "in fact, I'm so happy that my first time was you. I can't imagine, and I wouldn't let anyone else in this world take that from me. I would be mad if it wasn't you. What's more," she continued with a soft smile, "this means we just salvaged our relationship, right?"
当然不是！" 明日香欣喜地喊道，"其实，我很高兴第一次是和你。我无法想象，也不会允许世界上任何其他人夺走这份经历。如果不是你，我会发疯的。更重要的是，" 她继续柔声微笑着说，"这意味着我们刚刚挽救了我们的关系，对吧？

"Right," Shinji smiled as well. He didn't know this could go so easily. "So… let's go home?"
对，" 真嗣也笑了。他没想到事情会这么顺利。"那么……我们回家吧？

"Yeah," Asuka's mood was too good to start arguing. Besides, one of the heaviest weights on her shoulder just vanished. "Let's go home."
嗯，" 明日香的心情好得无法开始争吵。况且，她肩上最沉重的负担之一刚刚消失了。"我们回家吧。

Next Morning 第二天早晨

Shinji hummed Ode to Joy, tripping lightly around the apartment's kitchen as he prepared the breakfasts and bentos for lunch. Last night's sleep was peaceful for both of them, even under Kaji's supervision. Suddenly he felt a pair of slender hands wrapped around his torso and a soft kiss was placed on his neck. "What's for breakfast, darling?" Came Asuka's dizzy voice.
真嗣哼着《欢乐颂》，轻快地在公寓厨房里转悠，准备着早餐和午餐的便当。昨晚在加持的看护下，两人都睡得很安稳。忽然，他感到一双纤细的手臂环抱住他的腰，脖颈上落下一个温柔的吻。“亲爱的，早餐吃什么？”传来明日香迷迷糊糊的声音。

Shinji managed to subdue his wide smile that crept up his face as he recognized the voice, "good morning, Asuka. Scrambled eggs with some toast and bacon," he replied, turning around, "good night's sleep?"
真嗣努力抑制住脸上蔓延开的笑容，听出了声音的主人，“早上好，明日香。有炒蛋、吐司和培根，”他转过身回答，“睡得好吗？”

"Slept well, thanks to you," her eyes still dreamy, "I-thanks for not…for doing what you did…last night," Asuka blushed a little, "I was drunk, alright," her voice turned soft, "but…what I said was true, I really want you." She finished, pulling away from the embrace.
“睡得很好，多亏了你，”她的眼神依旧朦胧，“我——谢谢你昨晚没有……做那件事……”明日香脸上泛起一丝红晕，“我喝醉了，好吧，”她的声音变得柔和，“但是……我说的都是真的，我真的需要你。”她说完，从拥抱中抽身离开。

"Asuka, what I said was all true as well," Shinji started portioning their breakfasts, "and… it's not like…we haven't done it before," he managed to add without furiously blushing.
“明日香，我说的也都是真的，”真嗣开始分早餐，“而且……我们又不是……没做过，”他勉强补充道，脸上没有涨得通红。

"Hmph, you're a baka, no doubt," Asuka huffed, "but I want this. It makes me happy. Don't you want to make me happy, Shinji?" She said with an inquisitive look.
"哼，你这个笨蛋，毫无疑问，" 明日香哼了一声，"但我想要这个。它让我快乐。难道你不想让我快乐吗，真嗣？" 她带着探询的表情说道。

Seeing no more reasons to hold back, Shinji gave in, "if that's the case… I'm willing to…make you happy," his blush returned, "but…we can't…not with Misato and Kaji around us!" He reasoned.
看到没有更多理由克制，真嗣妥协了，"如果是这样的话……我愿意……让你快乐，" 他的脸颊再次泛红，"但是……我们不能……有美里和加持在旁边！" 他解释道。

"Well, we'll find a way, nothing stops the Great Asuka Shikinami from her goals." Asuka boasted, "let's worry about it later. We still have another simulator test today. Let's get ready!"
好吧，我们会找到办法的，没有什么能阻止伟大的式波·明日香追求她的目标。" 明日香自夸道，"我们以后再担心这个。今天还有另一个模拟器测试。我们准备一下吧！

"Do you think we can have sex here?" Asuka inquired half-jokingly as they wandered around in an unfamiliar empty street, "it's a simulated world, I'm curious how…detailed it could be," she finished with a mischievous grin.
"你觉得我们能在这里做爱吗？" 明日香半开玩笑地问道，他们在一个陌生的空旷街道上徘徊，"这是一个模拟的世界，我很好奇它能有多……细致，" 她带着调皮的笑容结束了这句话。

"Asuka…I think this world is monitored, including our speeches," Shinji facepalmed in embarrassment.
"明日香…我觉得这个世界是被监控的，包括我们的谈话。" 碇真嗣尴尬地捂住了脸。

True to his words… "He's right, Asuka," Naoko Akagi's voice sounded in their heads, "we know every movement you make and every word you say."
正如他所说… "他是对的，明日香，" 赤木直子的声音在他们脑海中响起，"我们知道你们的一举一动，一言一语。"

"WHAT?!" Asuka cried, astonished, "wh-what about the earlier tests?"
什么？！" 明日香惊呼，震惊不已，"那…那之前的测试呢？

"You mean the tests where your synchronization is needed? They were different kinds of tests, we couldn't exactly monitor your dreams," Naoko explained, "however, here is a different case."
你是说需要你们同步率的那些测试？那些测试性质不同，我们无法监控你们的梦境，" 赤木解释道，"但这里的情况不同。

Asuka pouted, her face furiously flushing, "Scheisse! Gottverdammt!" She swore under mortification, "Sie sollten früher sagte mir haben!"
明日香噘着嘴，脸涨得通红，“该死！真见鬼！”她羞愤地咒骂道，“你们应该早点告诉我的！”

"It was you who didn't pay attention, Asuka," Naoko's voice was clearly amused, "too bad…now everyone in the observation room knows your little secret."
“是你自己没注意，明日香，”直子的声音显然带着笑意，“可惜了……现在观察室里的每个人都知道你的小秘密了。”

"Arghhhh! Damn it!" Asuka punched the wall beside her with all the might she could muster – it hurt, but she wasn't bleeding. In fact, the wall she just struck turned black – small black spheres started flying out of the void, turning everything they touched black as well.
“啊啊啊！可恶！”明日香用尽全力朝身边的墙壁猛击一拳——虽然疼，但并没有流血。事实上，她刚刚击中的墙壁变黑了——从虚空中飞出的小黑球开始四处飞散，所触之物皆化为黑色。

Asuka let out a yelp and jumped back; her combat reflex was a blessing. "Wh-what is going on here?" Her voice carried a tinge of worry.
明日香惊叫一声，急忙后退；她的战斗本能真是救命稻草。“这……这是怎么回事？”她的声音带着一丝忧虑。

In the observation room, the klaxon sounded, indicating something had gone terribly wrong. Naoko's panic eyes scanned through the readings on her terminal, reaching a horrifying conclusion seconds later, "there's some sort of computer virus in the MAGI! It's polluting the simulated world!"
在观察室内，警报响起，预示着发生了严重的问题。直子的惊恐眼神扫过终端上的读数，几秒钟后得出了一个可怕的结论：“MAGI 系统中存在某种计算机病毒！它正在污染模拟世界！”

Her words reached the Children's ears – more precisely, the voice sounded in their heads – and they began panicking as well. "What do you mean by computer virus?! I thought MAGI is the fastest computer worldwide! Surely it could handle something as trivial as a little malware!"
她的话传到了孩子们的耳中——更准确地说，是声音在他们脑海中响起——他们也开始恐慌起来。“计算机病毒是什么意思？！我以为 MAGI 是全球最快的计算机！肯定能处理像小病毒这样的琐碎问题！”

"This…this virus is nothing like what we've seen before," Naoko replied after a careful examination, "its code traits are not registered in our anti-virus database. The firewall is failing to contain the spread!"
“这种……这种病毒与我们之前见过的完全不同，”直子在仔细检查后回答道，“它的代码特征在我们的反病毒数据库中没有记录。防火墙无法阻止其扩散！”

"Well that sounds so safe!"
“听起来真是安全极了！”

"You two! Get as far away from those black spheres as possible!" Naoko typed furiously on her keyboard, trying to come up with something – anything that would at least slow down the contamination process. She quickly came up with the idea that would at least ensure the Children's safety for now, "I've uploaded some code into the simulator! It should materialize as a house painted in red! Get in the safe house as soon as possible! I used type-666 firewall, it should buy us some time!"
你们两个！尽量远离那些黑色球体！"直子疯狂地在键盘上敲击，试图想出任何能至少减缓污染进程的办法。她迅速构思出一个至少能确保孩子们目前安全的方案，"我已经向模拟器上传了一些代码！它应该会实体化成一座红色房子！尽快进入安全屋！我用了 666 型防火墙，应该能为我们争取一些时间！

The Children frantically looked around them – indeed, a red house emerged out of nowhere in front of them. They rushed to the house, shutting the door tightly behind them after they both got in. The black spheres tried to break in, but fortunately, they seemed to fail.
孩子们惊慌地环顾四周——果然，一座红色房子凭空出现在他们面前。他们冲向房子，两人一进去就紧紧关上了门。黑色球体试图闯入，但幸运的是，它们似乎未能成功。

"Any progress analyzing the data?" Naoko asked, looking intently at her terminal. "The virus is self-evolving," Maya reported, her hands typing, trying to set up more firewalls and fake tunnels to contain the spread of the virus. "So far none of our anti-virus methods has worked! The virus is adapting too quickly! It has already learned to evade our scans!"
数据分析有进展吗？"直子紧盯着终端问道。"这种病毒具有自我进化能力，"玛雅报告说，她的双手在键盘上飞舞，试图设置更多防火墙和虚假通道以遏制病毒的扩散。"到目前为止，我们的任何反病毒措施都无效！病毒适应得太快了！它已经学会躲避我们的扫描了！

"Not good…" Naoko murmured, "any idea on how it may affect the Children?"
情况不妙……"直子低声自语，"有没有关于它可能如何影响孩子们的线索？

"Nothing, except it's preventing us from pulling their consciousness out of the simulator," Maya replied, trying to disconnect Shinji and Asuka from MAGI again, and failed. "It seems like the virus is directly after the Children, though."
没什么，只是它阻止了我们把他们的意识从模拟器中拉出来，" 玛雅回答道，试图再次将真嗣和明日香从 MAGI 中分离，但失败了。"看起来病毒似乎是直接针对这些孩子的。

"Any idea on how did the virus get in our system, then?"
那病毒是怎么进入我们系统的，有头绪吗？

"One thing for sure, the virus is injected by a third-party," Maya answered, "their intention is positively malicious."
有一点可以肯定，病毒是由第三方注入的，" 玛雅回答，"他们的意图绝对是恶意的。

Asuka kicked a paper ball to the wall, her kick so powerful that the paper ball bounced back to the side of her feet. She kicked it again, this time it flew off and landed on Shinji's head. "Oi, Baka," seeing no reactions coming from the boy whatsoever, Asuka called out to him. "Hey, idiot!" She walked to him and smacked his head.
明日香一脚将纸团踢向墙壁，力道之大，纸团反弹回她的脚边。她再次踢出，这次纸团飞出去，落在了真嗣的头上。"喂，笨蛋，" 见男孩毫无反应，明日香喊道，"嘿，傻瓜！" 她走过去，拍了一下他的头。

"Ouch!" That snapped him out of his train of thought, "oh, Asuka, where were we?"
哎哟！" 这一声让他回过神来，"哦，明日香，我们刚才说到哪儿了？

"Our first time," Asuka huffed, "where and when and how did it happen. For some reason… I've got a strange feeling of déjà vu."
我们的第一次，" 明日香嘟囔着，"何时何地，又是怎么发生的。不知为何…我有一种奇怪的似曾相识感。

"Right," Shinji pondered for a moment more, "I think I've got some pieces together." He stood up, "we were…" he mouthed 'entry plug' to her, who nodded in confirmation, "and there was an…" 'Angel Attack,' he mouthed again; Asuka nodded, "how did we…defeat it, though?" Luckily the people in the observation room were too busy to care about the Children for now.
"对，" 真嗣沉思片刻，"我想我有些头绪了。" 他站起身，"我们当时在…" 他对着她做了个"插入栓"的口型，她点头确认，"然后发生了…" '使徒来袭'，他又做了个口型；明日香再次点头，"但我们是怎么…击败它的呢？" 幸好观察室里的人此刻正忙，无暇顾及这些孩子们。

"I think I know…" Shinji put a finger under his chin, "Dr. Akagi…" 'it's at least worth a try,' he thought, "Dr. Akagi!" He called out, trying to get her attention.
"我觉得我知道…" 真嗣用手指轻触下巴，"赤木博士…" '至少值得一试，' 他心想，"赤木博士！" 他大声呼唤，试图引起她的注意。

"Yes?" Came Naoko's panicked voice, "what is it? Is the firewall failing?"
怎么了？"直子惊慌的声音传来，"出什么事了？防火墙要撑不住了吗？

"No, not yet, but I think I have a solution to the problem," Shinji replied, raising Naoko's curiosity, "yes?"
不，还没到那一步，但我想到一个解决问题的办法，" 真嗣回答道，激起了直子的好奇心，"哦？

"You said the virus is evolving…right?"
你说过病毒正在变异…对吧？

"Yeah." 对。

"The end of evolution…is self-destruction, right? Death itself." Shinji dropped his hint, hoping like a brilliant scientist she was, Naoko could pick it up and come up with the solution.
"进化的终点…就是自我毁灭，对吧？死亡本身。" 真嗣抛出线索，希望如同杰出科学家般的直子能够领会并找到解决方案。

"RIGHT!" Naoko's enlightened voice came to him, "we just need to accelerate its evolution! You're brilliant, Shinji!" The said boy let out a nervous chuckle, mentally thanking Ritsuko Akagi in his old world.
"没错！" 直子顿悟的声音传来，"我们只需加速它的进化！你真聪明，真嗣！" 被提及的少年尴尬地笑了笑，心中默默感谢着旧世界的律子·赤木。

Naoko summoned a storm of keystrokes over her keyboard, burning off a small portion of her brain cells as she typed the codes on her terminal. Once she finished coding, she uploaded it into the MAGI - the code was effective, to say the least; the evolving virus quickly died off, much to Naoko's relief.
直子在键盘上掀起一阵敲击风暴，消耗了一小部分脑细胞，她在终端上输入代码。编码完成后，她将其上传至 MAGI——至少可以说，这段代码效果显著；进化的病毒迅速消亡，令直子松了一口气。

However, things weren't so easy. Although most of the virus was dead, the initial form of the virus - the progenitor of the evolving virus was still alive. It wasn't self-evolving, so the code had no effect on it. What's worse, the virus, albeit it could be scanned, but couldn't be located. The virus still exempted itself from anti-virus software.
然而，事情并非如此简单。尽管大部分病毒已消亡，但病毒的初始形态——进化病毒的始祖仍存活。它不具备自我进化能力，因此代码对它无效。更糟的是，尽管病毒可以被扫描，却无法定位。病毒依旧能规避杀毒软件的检测。

Naoko rubbed her forehead, groaning in frustration. Suddenly a dangerous yet prompting idea formed in her mind. The main reason they had difficulties dealing with the virus was that they couldn't locate it; but the Children said they could see it in the simulated world. So why not let the Children deal with the virus themselves?
直子揉着额头，懊恼地呻吟着。突然，一个既危险又迫切的念头在她脑海中形成。他们之所以难以应对这种病毒，主要是因为无法定位它；但孩子们说他们能在模拟世界中看到它。那为何不让孩子们自己来对付病毒呢？

It was extremely risky, that's for sure; still, Naoko couldn't come up with anything else. She could only pray the virus couldn't inflict actual harm on the kids.
这无疑极其冒险，这是肯定的；然而，直子实在想不出其他办法。她只能祈祷病毒无法对孩子们造成实际伤害。

"What?! You want us to shoot the black spheres with these guns?! Are you insane?!" Asuka exclaimed, unable to believe what she thought she had heard.
"什么？！你想让我们用这些枪射击那些黑色球体？！你疯了吗？！" 明日香惊呼道，无法相信自己所听到的。

"That's right, Second Child," Naoko's voice was cold but with a hint of worry, "I know what I'm asking you guys to do is dangerous, but that's the best shot we've got so far."
没错，第二适格者，" 直子的声音冷淡中带着一丝忧虑，"我知道我要求你们做的事情很危险，但这是我们目前最好的机会。

"Well, what do these guns do, anyway?" Asuka flipped the gun in her hand up and down, examining it thoroughly. It looked like more of a particle cannon, but that's only detail.
"那么，这些枪到底是干什么用的？" 明日香上下翻转着手中的枪，仔细检查着。它看起来更像是一种粒子炮，不过这只是细节问题。

"All it does is to delete whatever it hits from the system," Naoko explained, "don't worry about accidentally hitting each other. It can only erase electronic signals, not actual human minds. I have to warn you, though, that your minds only define your body in the simulator, not the clothes you're wearing. So don't be surprised when part of your plug suit melts under friendly fire."
它的作用就是将击中的任何东西从系统中删除，" 直子解释道，"不用担心会不小心击中彼此。它只能消除电子信号，而不是真正的人类思维。不过我得提醒你，你们的思维只在模拟器中定义了你们的身体，而不是你们穿着的衣服。所以，当你的插入服在友军火力下部分融化时，别太惊讶。

Asuka bit her lips, "well, why can't you just do this by yourself?"
明日香咬了咬嘴唇，"那你自己为什么不能做这件事呢？"

"If we could, we'd already done so," Naoko replied, "any more questions?"
如果我们能做，早就做了，" 直子回答，"还有其他问题吗？

Asuka turned to look at Shinji, whose eyes were showing a level of determination that she'd only seen when he was pulling her up to the balcony that night in Okinawa. Suddenly all of her insecurities were wiped off by the look in his eyes. Asuka smiled a confident smile, "let's do this, Shinji!"
明日香转头看向真嗣，他的眼神中透露出一种决心，这种决心她只在冲绳那晚他拉她上阳台时见过。突然间，她所有的疑虑都被他眼中的神情一扫而空。明日香露出了自信的微笑，“我们上吧，真嗣！”

The battle couple walked to the safehouse's door, hands clasping together. Asuka took a deep breath and nodded to the boy beside her, who smiled a reassuring smile and nodded as well.
这对战斗搭档手牵手走向安全屋的门。明日香深吸一口气，向身旁的男孩点了点头，男孩回以一个令人安心的微笑，也点了点头。

She kicked the door open, hastily finding herself a cover while Shinji aimed at the nearest sphere and fired.
她一脚踹开门，迅速找到掩体，而真嗣则瞄准最近的球体开火。

'Center the target. Pull the switch.'
'瞄准目标中心。扣动扳机。'

The black sphere's very existence was terminated the moment it got struck by the beam. There were eight spheres in total they could see, and they instantly noticed the Children's presence as their first comrade was formatted.
那黑色球体被光束击中的瞬间，其存在便被抹去。他们能看到的总共有八个球体，当第一个同伴被格式化时，其余七个立刻察觉到了孩子们的存在。

The other seven spheres flew to the Children at high speed. Asuka took aim and fired, hitting another sphere right in the center, erasing its existence instantly. She then fired three consecutive shots; she didn't need to worry about reloading or ammo, after all. Two of them hit the spheres and vaporized them, while the third shot hit a building not far away. The skyscraper flickered different colors and disappeared, exposing a digital void beneath it.
其余七个球体高速飞向孩子们。明日香瞄准并开火，正中另一个球体的中心，使其存在瞬间消散。接着她连发三枪；毕竟她无需担心装弹或弹药问题。其中两枪击中球体并将其蒸发，而第三枪则击中了不远处的一座建筑。那座摩天大楼闪烁着不同的颜色，随后消失，露出下方的数字虚空。

Shinji and Asuka stood back to back, "do you trust me?" Asuka asked, holding up her cannon. "Absolutely," Shinji replied, shooting another sphere in the center. "So do I," Asuka smirked, aimed, and scored.
真嗣和明日香背靠背站立，“你信任我吗？”明日香举起她的炮问道。“当然，”真嗣回答，随即又射中了一个球体的中心。“我也是，”明日香嘴角上扬，瞄准并命中目标。

The remaining two spheres rushed to the Children together in a suicidal attack. They lined up so that one could hide behind the other one. However, it wasn't even a bit troublesome for the Children; they fired a simultaneous shot, the powerful beam pierced right through the front one, hitting the latter sphere with no less effect. Both spheres vanished into meaningless digits.
剩下的两个球体一同冲向孩子们，发起自杀式攻击。它们排列成队，一个躲在另一个后面。然而，这对孩子们来说毫不费力；他们同时开火，强大的光束直接穿透前方的球体，同样有效地击中了后方的球体。两个球体都化作无意义的数字消散了。

Both Shinji and Asuka let out a sigh of relief. Asuka threw her cannon away, "phew...that was easy," she boasted, a proud smirk showed up on her face, "and you weren't half bad as a support, I suppose."
真嗣和明日香同时松了口气。明日香扔掉她的加农炮，“呼...真是轻松，”她得意地吹嘘道，脸上露出一丝自豪的笑容，“而且你作为支援也不算太差，我想。”

Shinji put down his cannon as well, "you did great, Asuka. No way I could do it without you."
真嗣也放下了他的加农炮，“你做得很好，明日香。没有你我肯定不行。”

"Of course. What do you expect from the Great Asuka?" Her ego already reaching the ionosphere, failing to notice another black sphere suddenly came out from behind a building, flying towards her with lightning speed.
“当然。你以为我是谁，伟大的明日香吗？”她的自负已经触及电离层，却未察觉到另一个黑色球体突然从建筑物后出现，以闪电般的速度向她飞来。

"ASUKA!" Shinji yelled, dashing forward and pushed the redhead away from her position - which left him to be the target of the virus.
"ASUKA!" 真嗣大喊着冲上前去，将红发少女从她的位置推开——这使得他自己成为了病毒的目标。

The black sphere engulfed him; Shinji shrieked in agony as he felt his head was gonna explode. "SHINJI!" Asuka cried, just coming back to her senses. She hastily picked up Shinji's cannon and took aim, "hold on Shinji, I'll save you!"
黑色球体吞噬了他；真嗣痛苦地尖叫起来，感觉自己的头快要爆炸了。"真嗣！" 明日香回过神来，急忙捡起真嗣的炮筒瞄准，"坚持住，真嗣，我来救你！"

"Belay that!" Naoko's voice stopped her dead in the tracks, "if you shoot the sphere, we don't know what could happen!"
停下！" 直子的声音让她戛然而止，"如果你射击那个球体，我们不知道会发生什么！

"I thought you said the cannon cant affect human minds!" Asuka shouted.
"你不是说炮筒不会影响人的心智吗！" 明日香喊道。

"It's true, but the virus is trying to fuse itself with Shinji's mind! His ego-barrier is breaching!" Naoko explained in a worried voice, "so wait until further notice!"
确实如此，但病毒正试图与真嗣的意识融合！他的自我防御正在崩溃！" 直子焦急地解释道，"所以请等待进一步通知！

"THERE'S NO WAY I'M LEAVING HIM LIKE THIS!" Asuka roared.
"我绝不会就这样丢下他不管！" 明日香怒吼道。

Just as she took aim again and about to pull the trigger, the black sphere suddenly detached itself from Shinji, leaving an unconscious boy lying on the ground. She didn't hesitate a second and fired, obliterating the virus in an instant.
就在她再次瞄准，准备扣动扳机之际，黑色球体突然从真嗣身上脱离，留下一个昏迷不醒的少年躺在地上。她毫不犹豫地开火，瞬间将病毒彻底摧毁。

As soon as the sphere was destroyed, Asuka shot open her eyes and found herself sitting in the entry plug. She mentally praised God before opening up a comm channel to the other entry plug. "Shinji? Shinji! Answer me damn it!"
球体一被摧毁，明日香猛地睁开眼睛，发现自己正坐在插入栓内。她心中默默感谢上帝，随后打开与其他插入栓的通讯频道。"真嗣？真嗣！快回答我，该死！"

"Asuka, he's unconscious, but otherwise okay," Naoko reassured her, "we'll get him into our medical ward. You can wait outside the ward until I'm finished with my tests."
明日香，他虽然昏迷了，但其他方面还好，" 直子安慰她说，"我们会把他送到医疗室。你可以在外面等，直到我做完检查。

"What your thoughts on today's incident, Ikari?" SEELE 01's tone was cold and angry, "we almost lost The Two!"
你对今天的事件怎么看，碇？" SEELE 01 的语气冷硬而愤怒，"我们差点就失去了 The Two！

"Our initial investigation suggests that a secret organization against Gehirn, composed of spies and hackers, pulled off the little stunt today," Gendo Ikari replied calmly, "which means there's almost no time left."
初步调查显示，今天的小动作是由一个反对 Gehirn 的秘密组织策划的，成员包括间谍和黑客，" 碇源堂平静地回答，"这意味着我们几乎没有时间了。

"True. We will initiate the contact experiment as soon as possible." SEELE 03 added, "I noticed something interesting in Naoko's report, though. It says the virus was successful in breaching Third Child's ego-barrier, however the strength of his ego-barrier skyrocketed at the last moment. Curious."
确实。我们将尽快启动接触实验。" SEELE 03 补充道，"不过，我在直子的报告中注意到了一些有趣的内容。报告称，病毒成功突破了第三适格者的自我屏障，但在最后关头，他的自我屏障强度突然飙升。真是耐人寻味。

"It seems the S theory proposed by Dr. Katsuragi is correct, after all. Angels have S2 organs, and they possess AT-Fields, the barrier of the soul. Since The Two are akin to the Angels, they must possess similar powers. It's only logical that Third Child's ego-barrier was strong enough to withstand the attack of the virus."
看来碇博士提出的 S 理论终究是正确的。使徒拥有 S2 机关，以及 AT 力场，即灵魂的屏障。既然两者与使徒相似，他们必然也拥有类似的力量。第三适格者的自我屏障足以抵御病毒攻击，这合乎逻辑。

"Good. Contact Dr. Katsuragi immediately. Arrange the expedition to Antarctica as soon as possible." SEELE 01 concluded, "we have no time left to waste."
好。立即联系碇博士。尽快安排南极考察行动。" SEELE 01 总结道，"我们没有时间可以浪费了。

Asuka had been sitting at Shinji's bedside for the last three hours; she came in as soon as Naoko completed her tests, refusing to leave by any means, not even taking a shower. She was drenched in LCL, her hair was a complete mess, emitting a gross smell of blood.
过去三个小时里，明日香一直坐在真嗣的床边；她一等直子完成测试就进来了，无论如何也不肯离开，甚至没有去洗澡。她浑身沾满 LCL，头发凌乱不堪，散发着一股血腥的难闻气味。

Shinji stirred and grudgingly opened his eyes. "Ahhh...an unfamiliar ceiling again..." he muttered.
真嗣动了动，不情愿地睁开眼睛。"啊……又是陌生的天花板……"他喃喃自语。

"SHINJI!" Asuka exclaimed, pulling the boy into a bear hug, "you're awake! Are you okay?"
真嗣！"明日香惊呼道，一把将男孩紧紧拥入怀中，"你醒了！你还好吗？

Shinji coughed, "Asuka...air..."
真嗣咳嗽着，"明日香...空气..."

"Oh, sorry," Asuka let out an embarrassed chuckle and let go of the boy, "so, how are you feeling?"
哦，抱歉，"明日香尴尬地笑了笑，松开了男孩，"那么，你现在感觉怎么样？

"I'm...fine," he replied after shaking his head several times, "just a bit dizzy, that's all."
我...还好，"他摇了几次头后回答，"只是有点晕，仅此而已。

"Good, because now I can do this," Asuka said in an unreadable voice.
"好，因为现在我可以这么做了," 明日香用一种难以捉摸的语气说道。

Shinji's brain took four long seconds to finally register the stinging sensation on his right cheek; a distinct sound of a slap echoed in the ward.
真嗣的大脑花了整整四秒钟才终于感受到右颊上的刺痛；一声清脆的耳光声在病房中回响。

"Shinji you're such an idiot!" Tears started to flow down her cheeks, "don't you ever do that to me again! Just how many times do you have to be a god damned hero!" She cried into his chest.
"真嗣你这个笨蛋！" 泪水开始顺着她的脸颊流下，"你再也不许那样对我了！你到底要当多少次该死的英雄！" 她哭着扑进他的怀里。

Shinji didn't know what to do in this situation; he instinctively wrapped his arms around the redhead, "I will do it again if it's necessary..." he trailed off, Asuka raised her head and shot him an incredulous glare, "why?!" She hissed.
真嗣在这种情形下不知所措；他本能地用双臂环抱住红发女孩，"如果必要，我还会再做一次..." 他声音渐弱，明日香抬起头，用难以置信的目光瞪着他，"为什么？！" 她咬牙切齿地问。

"Because...because I think I love you, Asuka," Shinji blushed a little, "I'd do anything for you."
因为...因为我觉得我爱你，明日香，" 真嗣脸上泛起一丝红晕，"我愿意为你做任何事。

"Shinji you Baka, I thought it should be obvious that you love me," her cheeks turned pink, "I love you too, just you know that." She added in a soft whisper before resting her head on his chest again.
"真嗣你这个笨蛋，我以为你应该很清楚你爱我，" 她的脸颊也染上了粉色，"我也爱你，只是你知道就好。" 她轻声细语地补充道，随后再次将头靠在他的胸膛上。

Shinji closed his eyes, fighting back his own tears. He'd never thought someone else in the world could ever love him before. He let out a content sigh and snuggled closer to the beautiful redhead lying on his chest. All was right in the world.
真嗣闭上眼睛，努力抑制住自己的泪水。他从未想过世界上还会有人爱他。他满足地叹了口气，更紧地依偎在躺在他胸前的美丽红发女孩身边。世界一切安好。

### Chapter 11: Before Dawn
黎明之前

"Well, Shinji, I'm glad to give you a clean bill of health," Ritsuko Akagi summarized, putting down the notepad, "no physical injuries, the biopsy came clean, and no…mental contamination, either," she remarked, carefully not disclosing too much information, "you can go home as soon as you like." She turned to the redhead sitting in a chair beside the bed that was supposed to be hers, and gave her a knowing smile – almost a smug smirk – and left the room in one swift movement, her white lab coat fluttered behind her.
"那么，真嗣，我很高兴地告诉你，你的健康状况良好，" 赤木律子总结道，放下手中的笔记本，"没有身体伤害，活检结果正常，也没有...精神污染，" 她评论道，小心翼翼地没有透露太多信息，"你想回家随时都可以。" 她转向坐在本应属于她的床边椅子上的红发女孩，给了她一个心照不宣的微笑——几乎是一种得意的笑——然后迅速离开了房间，她的白色实验服在身后飘扬。

"Well Baka, you heard her. Do you feel good enough to go home?" Asuka asked, crossing her arms, "I'm kinda starving, waiting here for hours and ate nothing, so I'm expecting a German feast tonight!"
喂，笨蛋，你听见她说的了。你感觉好到可以回家了吗？" 明日香问道，交叉着双臂，"我在这里等了好几个小时，什么都没吃，饿坏了，所以今晚我期待一顿德国大餐！

Shinji stretched his body; his limbs were working exceptionally, and there weren't any sour muscles, either. He got up from bed, still wearing a hospital gown, "alright, let me change my clothes…" he grabbed a blue t-shirt and a pair of jeans, unbuttoning the hospital gown. Suddenly he stopped and looked at Asuka, a faint blush crept up his cheeks. "Err, Asuka, do you mind-"
真嗣伸展了一下身体；他的四肢活动自如，也没有任何酸痛的肌肉。他从床上起来，仍然穿着医院的病号服，"好吧，让我换下衣服……" 他拿起一件蓝色 T 恤和一条牛仔裤，开始解开病号服的扣子。突然他停了下来，看向明日香，脸上泛起一丝红晕。"呃，明日香，你介意-"

Asuka frowned at first, then also flushed as the realization dawned on her, "Baka, there's nothing I haven't seen before, Ja?"
明日香先是皱了皱眉，随后也脸红起来，恍然大悟道：“笨蛋，还有什么是我没见过的吗，对吧？”

Shinji's blush deepened, "erm, I guess…" He turned his back to her, held his breath, and unbuttoned the gown; the cloth fell to the floor with a soft flapping sound, exposing his nude backside for Asuka to behold, who was doing a terrible job keeping her gaze above his waist, her blush quickly turned luminescent.
真嗣的脸颊愈发红润，“呃，我想也是……”他转过身去，屏住呼吸，解开袍子的扣子；随着一声轻柔的布料落地声，他的裸背展露在明日香眼前，而明日香正极力控制自己不要往下看，她的脸颊迅速变得通红发亮。

Feeling his back heating up under Asuka's gaze, Shinji swiftly put on his garments and turned around. Shuffle bag hanged on both hands, electronic gadgets in pockets, he signaled the German girl to open the door for him. Asuka furrowed her brows and walked to him, "You're really an idiot." She took the shuffle bag from him, carrying it herself, "now you go open the door."
感受到明日香的目光让自己的背部发热，真嗣迅速穿好衣服，转过身来。他双手提着行李袋，口袋里装着电子设备，示意那位德国女孩为他开门。明日香皱着眉头走向他，“你真是个傻瓜。”她从他手中接过行李袋，自己提着，“现在你去开门吧。”

"Thank you, Asuka," Shinji smiled an Asuka's-heart-melting smile and pressed the button. The duo walked outside, finding Misato already waiting at the end of the hallway. "Hey kiddos," she greeted the Children as soon as they came into not-disturbing-other-patients hearing range, "we…have a lot to talk about once we get home. Now hurry up."
“谢谢你，明日香，”真嗣露出一个让明日香心都融化的微笑，按下了按钮。两人走出房间，发现美里已经在走廊尽头等候。“嘿，小家伙们，”他们一进入不会打扰其他病人的范围，美里就向他们打招呼，“我们……回家后有很多话要说。现在快点吧。”

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other before shrugging in unison, then followed the lavender-haired women into the elevator.
真嗣和明日香对视一眼，然后默契地耸了耸肩，跟随那位紫发女子走进了电梯。

"Hm, just the way I liked! Wunderbar Shinji-darling!" Asuka - who just took a spoonful of Spätzle her lover – she loved the sound of that - had cooked for her – praised, "Gott, I could stay under your care forever." Her eyes gleamed the word 'love' as she looked at the said boy.
"嗯，正合我意！太棒了，真嗣亲爱的！"明日香刚尝了一口她的恋人——她喜欢这个称呼——为她做的斯帕茨勒，赞叹道，"天啊，我真想永远被你照顾。"她凝视着那个男孩，眼中闪烁着"爱"这个字眼。

Shinji blushed, apparently not knowing what to say under these kinds of situations; fortunately for him Misato noticed his embarrassment and spoke up, "there's something I need to tell you," she trailed off; upon gathering both Children's attention, she continued, "Gehirn's gonna…take you on a trip to Antarctica."
真嗣脸颊泛红，显然在这种情境下不知该如何回应；幸好，美里察觉到了他的窘迫，便开口道："我有件事要告诉你们，"她顿了顿；待两个孩子的注意力都集中过来后，她继续说，"Gehirn 要带你们去南极旅行。"

Asuka's eyes widened, practically jumping up from her seat in joy, "FOR REAL? ANTARCTICA?" Her phone was taken out from her pocket in blinking speed before Asuka typed furiously on it, "MEIN GOTT now is the polar night! I got to see AURORA! YESSSS!" She squealed in ecstasy. It had always been one of her fantasies to see Aurora in person since she was little. "When is it? When is it?!"
明日香的眼睛瞪得老大，几乎是从座位上跳了起来，"真的吗？南极？"她以迅雷不及掩耳之势从口袋里掏出手机，手指飞快地敲击着屏幕，"我的天，现在是极夜！我要去看极光了！耶！"她兴奋得尖叫起来。自小以来，亲眼见到极光一直是她的梦想之一。"什么时候去？什么时候去？！"

Misato laughed nervously, not used to the redhead's exhilarated state, "very soon. Actually I think it's tomorrow if I remember correctly. The news came in as a surprise, sorry I didn't have time to tell you before."
碇真嗣有些沮丧地说：“嗯，我想是吧……”

"YESSS! WUNDERBAR!" Asuka turned her head to Shinji, who was currently sitting in his seat quietly, seemingly to have a lot on his mind, "Shinji, aren't you excited?" She probed, coming down from her elated state.
明日香皱了皱眉，“你就这点热情？”她思索片刻，“换个角度看——我们会有一些独处的时间。”她背对着美里，调皮地向他眨了眨眼，而美里则是一头雾水。

"Yeah, I guess…" Shinji moped.
美里紧张地笑了笑，不习惯红发少女的兴奋状态，“很快了。实际上，如果我没记错的话，应该是明天。这个消息来得突然，抱歉之前没来得及告诉你。”

Asuka frowned, "that's your enthusiasm?" she pondered for a moment, "look at it this way – we'll get some private times to ourselves." She winked at him teasingly, her back to Misato, who was in a very confused state.
"太棒了！太好了！"明日香转头看向正在座位上静静坐着、似乎心事重重的真嗣，"真嗣，你不兴奋吗？"她从兴奋的状态中稍稍平复，试探地问道。

To her satisfaction Shinji seemed to relax a little, "Asuka… it's not like I don't like spending more time with you," he paused for a moment, "it's just…I need to tell you something. Later."
令她欣慰的是，真嗣似乎稍微放松了一些，“明日香……并不是我不愿意和你多待一会儿，”他顿了顿，“只是……我有件事得告诉你。待会儿再说。”

"Alright, but you'd better get psyched up for it!" Asuka pouted, wondering what could be wrong with the sorrowful Third Child.
“好吧，但你最好给我打起精神来！”明日香噘着嘴，心中纳闷这个悲伤的第三适格者到底出了什么问题。

The two teenagers were settled comfortably on the bed, facing each other, their hands resting at each other's waists, safely isolated from the flesh by rather flimsy but present clothing, legs intertwined at calf level. Shinji had been sulking all evening long, even when Asuka 'accidentally' showed more cleavage in bed it did not get his attention, much to her dismay.
两位少年舒适地坐在床上，面对面，双手搭在对方的腰间，隔着薄薄的衣物与肌肤保持安全距离，小腿在脚踝处交缠。整个晚上，真嗣都闷闷不乐，即便明日香“不小心”在床上露出了更多乳沟，也未能引起他的注意，这让她颇为失望。

After a long while, Shinji broke the uncomfortable silence, "Asuka… there's something I need to tell you."
过了许久，真嗣打破了这令人不安的沉默，“明日香……我有件事必须告诉你。”

"Yeah, I figured as much," she planted a soft kiss on his lips, "now speak – I promise to listen carefully!"
嗯，我猜也是，"她轻轻地吻了一下他的唇，"现在说吧——我保证认真听！

Shinji inhaled deeply, closing his eyes, "Asuka…remember when I told you there's a prophesier in my dreams?"
真嗣深吸一口气，闭上眼睛，"明日香……记得我告诉过你，我梦里有个预言者吗？"

"Ja, the one who told you…that," she blushed a faint blush, "what else did he tell you?"
嗯，就是那个告诉你……"她脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，"他还告诉你什么了？

"He said…I…we need to stop the Second Impact," he finally said, looking into Asuka's bright blue eyes – which blinked in surprise, "in…Antarctica, yeah."
他说……我……我们需要阻止第二次冲击，"他终于开口，凝视着明日香那双惊讶中闪烁的明亮蓝眼睛，"在……南极，没错。

"Gott… that's why you looked so…down, when you heard the news." She rubbed her chin, her eyes widened as his words finally registered in her brain, "wait, WHAT? SECOND IMPACT?" She managed to shout in a whisper, "how are we supposed to stop that?!"
天哪…难怪你听到消息时那么…沮丧。" 她摩挲着下巴，眼睛因他的话终于在大脑中形成回路而瞪大，"等等，什么？第二次冲击？" 她勉强压低声音惊呼，"我们怎么可能阻止得了那个？

"I don't know, I'm hoping the prophesier could give me more answers…"
我不知道，我希望能从预言者那里得到更多答案…

"Hm, but does this mean…Gehirn is gonna…cause Second Impact?" Her college-level intelligence brain started to connect the dots, "now it makes sense…why we are the only ones could do their tests! It must be somehow related to our EVA piloting capabilities!"
嗯，那这是否意味着…Gehirn 会…引发第二次冲击？" 她那大学水平的聪明头脑开始将线索串联起来，"现在说得通了…为什么只有我们能进行他们的测试！这肯定与我们的 EVA 驾驶能力有关！

"Yeah, I suppose you're right…this can't be a coincidence," Shinji agreed, all the events that had happened - starting from his life-changing arrival at Tokyo-3 to this very moment - replayed in his head. "Maybe…we can talk tomorrow? I mean, perhaps the prophesier will give me answers tonight…" he yawned.
"是啊，我想你是对的…这不可能只是巧合，" 真嗣同意道，从他改变命运的抵达第三新东京市开始，到此刻为止的所有事件在他脑海中重现。"或许…我们明天再谈？我是说，也许预言者今晚就会给我答案…" 他打了个哈欠。

"Alright, if you say so," Asuka agreed after several seconds of pondering, "goodnight, Shinji-darling." She snuggled into his chest and closed her eyes, relishing in the warmth, and let out a content sigh.
"好吧，既然你这么说，" 明日香沉思了几秒后同意道，"晚安，真嗣宝贝。" 她依偎在他的胸前，闭上眼睛，享受着这份温暖，满意地叹了口气。

Asuka slowly opened her eyes, finding herself stood on a grey flight deck; looking around her surroundings, she immediately recognized this place.
明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己站在一个灰色的飞行甲板上；环顾四周，她立刻认出了这个地方。

Over the Rainbow. 彩虹之上。

"Asuka?" A familiar voice called out to her; she turned in the direction of the voice and saw a dark brown-haired boy, a questioning frown on his face. "Shinji?" She replied, walking closer to the boy.
"明日香？" 一个熟悉的声音呼唤她；她转向声音的方向，看到一个深棕色头发的男孩，脸上带着疑惑的皱眉。"真嗣？" 她回应道，向男孩走近。

"Um, I'm dreaming, right?" Shinji asked as Asuka walked into a huggable distance.
"呃，我在做梦，对吧？" 真嗣问道，此时明日香正走近到可以拥抱的距离。

"I'm also dreaming," she answered, "well…does this mean we're somehow into each other's dreamworld again?"
我也在梦里，" 她回答说，"那么……这是否意味着我们又莫名其妙地进入了彼此的梦境？

"But we aren't using the chip, right?" Shinji asked, confused, "how can we-"
但我们并没有使用芯片，对吧？" 真嗣困惑地问，"这怎么可能——

"I can explain," another voice broke in. Shinji and Asuka looked in the direction of the voice; a cloaked figure was floating down from the sky, his cape fluttered in the air. "Pro-prophesier?" Shinji probed, raising his eyebrows.
"我可以解释，" 另一个声音插了进来。真嗣和明日香朝声音的方向望去；一个披着斗篷的身影正从天空中飘落，他的披风在空中飘扬。"预言者？" 真嗣试探性地问道，挑起了眉毛。

The prophesier chuckled, "right." He landed on the flight deck without producing so much as an audible sound, "I'm here to answer your questions, which I'm pretty sure you've got a lot."
预言者轻笑一声，“没错。”他无声无息地降落在飞行甲板上，“我来这里是为了解答你们的疑问，我敢肯定你们有一大堆问题。”

"No shit Sherlock," Asuka huffed, "first question, is Gehirn planning to initiate Second Impact in Antarctica?!"
“废话少说，福尔摩斯，”明日香哼了一声，“第一个问题，Gehirn 计划在南极引发第二次冲击吗？！”

"Yes," the prophesier answered without hesitation, "to elaborate, they are trying to use you two to initiate Second Impact."
“是的，”预言者毫不犹豫地回答，“详细来说，他们是打算利用你们两个来引发第二次冲击。”

"Figures…" Shinji sighed, "you once said…we need to prevent the Second Impact? How?"
“果然如此…”真嗣叹了口气，“你曾经说过…我们需要阻止第二次冲击？该怎么做？”

"So I suppose both of you know the truth behind Second Impact?" The prophesier inquired.
"这么说来，你们俩应该都知道第二次冲击背后的真相了吧？"预言者问道。

"Yeah, but it wouldn't hurt to hear it from you," Asuka replied, crossing her arms, "you're some kind of God, so you must know more than Baka-Shinji and me here."
嗯，不过听你亲口说也无妨，"明日香交叉双臂回应，"你这种神一般的存在，肯定比笨蛋真嗣和我了解更多。

"Fair enough," the prophesier then explained in detail about the truth behind Second Impact – how a bunch of ignorant scientists believed they could harvest the power of God, which in turn caused the largest and evilest massacre of humanity in history. The Children listened up with two hundred percent attention, afraid of missing any detail that might be crucial later on. "In short, we need Adam dead before they try to initiate the contact experiment using you."
好吧，"预言者随即详细解释了第二次冲击背后的真相——一群无知的科学家如何自以为能汲取神的力量，结果却引发了历史上最大最恶的人类屠杀。孩子们全神贯注地听着，生怕错过任何可能日后关键的细节。"简而言之，我们需要在对方试图利用你们进行接触实验之前，确保亚当已死。

"Mein Gott, and we participated in the tests Gehirn made us do," Asuka clenched her fists, "Arschloch! I trusted them!"
我的天，我们还参与了 Gehirn 让我们做的测试，"明日香紧握拳头，"混蛋！我竟然信任了他们！

"I understand you, but this only has to do with Gendo, Naoko, Fuyutsuki, and Yui, as well as SEELE, other people don't know so much as the tip of the iceberg," said the prophesier.
"我理解你，但这只与源渡、直子、冬月和唯，以及 SEELE 有关，其他人对此知之甚少，不过是冰山一角。"预言者说道。

"So what do we do now?" Shinji asked.
"那我们现在该怎么办？"真嗣问道。

"We don't have enough time tonight, you guys need to wake up soon," the prophesier replied, "though it is needed that you two go to Antarctica."
今晚我们时间不够了，你们很快就得醒来，"预言者回答，"尽管你们俩确实需要前往南极。

"Alright, but you'd better come up with a feasible plan!"
好吧，但你最好能想出一个可行的计划！

The sight of the two Children cuddling was not an unfamiliar sight to one called Kaji Ryoji; in fact, he welcomed the scene more than he thought he would. Initially, he was not a big fan of Shinji - his charge - dating someone as cocky and bossy as Asuka, but his perception of her had changed rather quickly. Now he's all in for those two being together – they deserved happiness in their lives. What's more, he was pleased that these two children weren't repeating he and Katsuragi's youthful indiscretion - at least not yet.
看到两个孩子依偎在一起的景象，对于被称为加持良治的人来说并不陌生；事实上，他比自己预想的还要欢迎这一幕。起初，他并不太喜欢真嗣——他的监护对象——与像明日香这样傲慢又专横的人约会，但他对她的看法很快就改变了。现在他完全支持这两个孩子在一起——他们值得在生活中找到幸福。更重要的是，他很高兴这两个孩子没有重蹈他和葛城年轻时的轻率行为——至少目前还没有。

As he beheld the adorable sight in front of him, both Children suddenly woke up simultaneously. Kaji raised his eyebrows at the perfect synchronicity. "You two really are cute together," he remarked as the kids got up and yawned, again in unison. "Couples married for years couldn't do what you two just pulled off."
当他目睹眼前这可爱的场景时，两个孩子突然同时醒来。加持对这种完美的同步性挑了挑眉。“你们俩在一起真的很可爱，”他评论道，孩子们起身打哈欠，再次同步。“结婚多年的夫妇也做不到你们俩刚才那样的默契。”

Both teens blushed, "Kaji-san!" they said in sync, "please stop teasing us!"
两个少年脸红了，“加持先生！”他们异口同声地说，“请不要再取笑我们了！”

"Hai, hai," Kaji chuckled, "get up, though. You need to pack your stuff for the trip to Antarctica."
“好的，好的，”加持笑着说，“起来吧。你们需要收拾行李，准备前往南极的旅行。”

"Right…" The kids' mood visibly lowered hearing those words, sending Kaji into a state of confusion. He thought kids like them should be excited to go somewhere as mysterious and famous as Antarctica.
"这样啊…"听到这话，孩子们的情绪明显低落了，让加持感到困惑。他原以为像他们这样的孩子应该会对去南极这样神秘而著名的地方感到兴奋。

After the morning routine, the Children took out their respective suitcases they used for the trip to Okinawa and began packing. Kaji told them Gehirn would provide thick expedition jackets, so they didn't need to worry about it, while Asuka being Asuka, crying about how those uniforms were so old-fashioned, she'd rather spend money and buy her own.
晨间例行结束后，孩子们拿出之前去冲绳旅行用的各自行李箱开始打包。加持告诉他们，Gehirn 会提供厚实的探险夹克，所以不用担心，而明日香还是那个明日香，抱怨那些制服太老土，她宁愿花钱自己买。

"Wait, what are you taking your laptop for?" Shinji probed as he saw Asuka taking out her Dell PC from their room, "it's not like there's internet in Antarctica or anything, and we've already got PS4 for entertainment."
等等，你带笔记本电脑干嘛？" 当看到明日香从房间里拿出她的戴尔电脑时，真嗣问道，"南极又没有网络，而且我们已经有 PS4 可以娱乐了。

"Anta Baka?" Asuka huffed, "it's for the movies."
你傻吗？" 明日香哼了一声，"这是为了看电影。

"Movie? What movies?" 电影？什么电影？

"Star Wars, what else?" said Asuka, shoving the computer into her backpack, "I've already got the six Star Wars episodes downloaded. You agreed to watch these with me, so you're not getting away from this!"
《星球大战》，还能有什么？" 明日香说着，把电脑塞进背包，"我已经下载了六部《星球大战》系列。你答应过要陪我看的，所以别想逃！

"Oh, okay," Shinji sweatdropped, not knowing what he got himself into. "By the way, Kaji-san, how are we gonna get there?"
哦，好吧，" 真嗣尴尬地擦了擦汗，不知道自己陷入了什么境地。"对了，加持先生，我们怎么去那里？

"By boat," the reply came instantly, "we'll take a plane first, the Icebreaker Shirase is waiting just outside the Antarctic Circle. She's one gorgeous ship," Kaji smiled as he spoke the name, "and you two have your own room, next to me and Katsuragi's."
坐船，" 回答立刻传来，"我们先乘飞机，破冰船'白濑'号就在南极圈外等着。她可是一艘漂亮的船，" 加持提到船名时微笑着，"你俩有单独的房间，就在我和葛城旁边。

"Wunderbar!" Asuka exclaimed, an ear-to-ear grin bloomed on her face, "we get privacy to do our own stuff!" She had so many...things they could do in her mind.
"太棒了！"明日香欢呼道，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容，"我们可以有私人空间做自己的事了！"她脑海中浮现出许多...可以做的事情。

Kaji smirked slyly, "wait a seocnd Asuka, the walls aren't soundproof, so please have some decency, you don't want to give people living there free shows do you?"
加持坏笑着提醒道："等等，明日香，这墙可不隔音，所以请注意点分寸，你总不想给邻居们免费表演吧？"

"WHAT?!" Asuka cried, at the same time an incandescent blush crept up her face, "I didn't mean it like that!"
什么？！"明日香惊叫起来，与此同时，一阵绯红爬上了她的脸颊，"我不是那个意思！

Kaji laughed at the red-faced, embarrassed Asuka; the temperamental girl could be eminently adorable sometimes.
加持看着满脸通红、尴尬不已的明日香笑了起来；这个脾气火爆的女孩有时真是可爱极了。

Shinji gazed down from the helicopter, admiring the grandness of the ocean's calm serenity. Over the course of the past month, he had witnessed and experienced so much – things he couldn't even imagine existing. Yet here he sat, still alive, taking in the endless blue that blanketed the earth below him, finding a faint sense of ease brought upon him by doing so.
真嗣从直升机上俯瞰，欣赏着大海平静的壮阔。在过去的一个月里，他见证并经历了太多——那些他甚至无法想象存在的事物。然而此刻，他依然活着，凝视着脚下无垠的蔚蓝，从中寻得一丝因之而来的淡淡安宁。

The chuffing sound of the heavy transport helicopter did little to distract him from his musings. He and Asuka - the girl he loved - were about to face the worst mass extinction event of humanity at its epicenter, and they were supposed to prevent it. Even though he had God's reassurance, he couldn't help but feel extremely anxious.
重型运输直升机的轰鸣声并未能将他从沉思中拉回。他和明日香——他心爱的女孩——即将在人类历史上最严重的灭绝事件的中心地带面对这一切，他们的任务是阻止它。尽管有神的保证，他仍无法抑制内心的极度焦虑。

The sudden feeling of deacceleration and weightlessness brought him back to reality. Looking down, there was a gigantic Icebreaker; it had a red hull and white bridge. He could see a few Japanese sailors wandering around the deck, presumably doing maintenance. As the chopper descended to the helipad at the back of the ship, Shinji appreciated the beauty around him, including a certain red-haired girl.
突如其来的减速和失重感将他拉回现实。低头望去，一艘巨大的破冰船映入眼帘；它有着红色的船身和白色的舰桥。他看到几名日本水手在甲板上徘徊，大概是在进行维护工作。随着直升机降落在船尾的停机坪上，真嗣欣赏着周围的美景，包括那位红发少女。

The chopper touched down, Misato and Kaji got out first, Shinji and Asuka right on their heels. Accompanying them were Naoko Akagi and several other scientists whom they didn't know, not that they cared enough to ask in the first place.
直升机降落后，先是美里和加持下了飞机，紧接着是真嗣和明日香紧随其后。随行的还有赤木直子和几位他们并不认识的科学家，不过他们也懒得去问。

Their accommodation was clean, to say the least, but definitely subpar even compared to Geofront's living quarters. Kaji was right about the wall being thin, though, much to Asuka's dismay.
他们的住处至少还算干净，但与 Geofront 的生活区相比，无疑是逊色不少。加持说得没错，墙壁确实很薄，这让明日香颇为不快。

While the Children sorted out their belongings, the PA system sounded, a deep and husky voice came through.
当孩子们整理行李时，广播系统突然响起，传来一个低沉沙哑的声音。

"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, I'm the captain of Shirase. We will arrive at our destiny, Hirosaki research station in two days. Then it would be the end of the trip for this ship. The space weather forecast says Aurora will appear starting from 6 p.m. today. The observation deck only has three binoculars on it, so you need to share. I sincerely hope you have a nice trip. Captain Genzo signing off."
女士们先生们，下午好，我是白瀬号的船长。我们将在两天后抵达目的地——弘前研究站，届时本船的航程也将结束。空间天气预报显示，今晚 6 点起将出现极光。观景台上只有三副望远镜，需要大家共享。衷心祝愿各位旅途愉快。船长源藏，通话完毕。

"You heard that Shinji?" Asuka said with a gleam in her eyes, tagging his shirt, "I'm soooo looking forward to it!"
你听见了吗，真嗣？"明日香眼中闪着光，拽了拽他的衣角，"我真是超级期待啊！

"Yeah, I've only seen Auroras online, but not in person," Shinji remarked, checking his watch, "it's only three o'clock, what do we do during this time?"
嗯，我只在网上的视频里见过极光，还没亲眼看过呢，"真嗣看了看手表，"现在才三点，这段时间我们做什么好呢？

"Perfect!" Asuka beamed, taking out her laptop, "let's get right into it!"
太好了！"明日香笑容满面地拿出笔记本电脑，"那我们这就开始吧！

Two Hours Later 两小时后

"Impressions? Criticism?" Asuka inquired as she closed her laptop, getting up from her seat, and headed toward her suitcase.
"印象？批评？"明日香问道，同时合上笔记本电脑，从座位上站起来，朝她的行李箱走去。

"Erm, the special effects were old, no doubt. And the politics…I don't really understand, but I think I like it," Shinji answered as Asuka opened her suitcase and took out a shirt, a coat, and a pair of long sports pants, "I mean, the concept is…interesting, the Force, the Jedi-di-di-di-" he stammered as he turned to look at Asuka, fighting a shock while pronouncing the final word.
"呃，特效确实很老旧。至于政治嘛……我不太懂，但我觉得挺喜欢的，" 真嗣回答道，此时明日香打开行李箱，拿出一件衬衫、一件外套和一条运动长裤，"我的意思是，这个概念……挺有意思的，原力、绝地武士什么的——" 他结结巴巴地说着，转头看向明日香，努力抑制着震惊，念出最后一个词。

Asuka stood there with nothing but her panties and bra on, the sundress she was wearing moments ago dropped into the suitcase. She looked at Shinji with a fake quizzical expression, "what's wrong? You look like a tomato." She finished with a smirk, putting the shirt on.
明日香只穿着内衣站在那里，刚才还穿在身上的太阳裙已经丢进了行李箱。她用一副假装的困惑表情看着真嗣，"怎么了？你看起来像个番茄。" 她带着一丝坏笑说完，开始穿上衬衫。

"A-A-Asuka…" he started after taking several deep breathes, trying to keep his eyes on her face but failing miserably, much to Asuka's satisfaction.
"明、明日香……" 他深吸了几口气后开口，试图让自己的目光停留在她的脸上，却失败得一塌糊涂，这让明日香颇为得意。

"What, you seriously thought I'd wear a dress on the observation deck of a ship?" She asked innocently, "not to mention we're near the south pole! I was freezing when I got out of the helicopter."
什么，你真以为我会在船的观测甲板上穿裙子？"她天真地问道，"更别提我们还在南极附近！我从直升机上下来时都快冻僵了。

"It's not…that, it's…" Shinji finally got his blood redirected to his brain as Asuka put the trousers on, "it's…unexpected, and I was surprised."
不是……那个，是……"当明日香穿上裤子时，真嗣终于让血液回流到大脑，"是……出乎意料，我有点惊讶。

"Hmm…" Asuka frowned a little, obviously not content with his answer, "so…how do you like it?"
嗯……"明日香微微皱眉，显然对他的回答不满意，"那么……你觉得怎么样？

"Like what? The movie? I said-"
觉得什么？电影吗？我说过——

"Baka!" Asuka snapped, mentally facepalming at his density, "I mean, how do you like…me? What you just saw of me, I mean."
笨蛋！" 明日香忍不住在心里扶额，对他的迟钝感到无奈，"我是说，你怎么看…我？就是你刚才看到的我。

Shinji's fading blush turned incandescent as he realized what she was asking about, "ah…I-I really like it, your b-body, I mean." He gulped, his brain failing to produce a more delicate compliment.
意识到她所指的问题，真嗣那渐渐消退的红晕瞬间变得炽热，"啊…我-我很喜欢，你的身-身体，我是说。" 他咽了口唾沫，大脑却无法组织出更委婉的赞美。

Fortunately, the other part of his body showed a much stronger opinion of what he just saw. "I know you liked it, I can see it…" Asuka pointed the finger at the bulge on his pants, a teasing grin on her face.
幸运的是，他身体的另一部分对刚才所见表达了更为强烈的意见。"我知道你喜欢，我看得出来…" 明日香指着他裤子上的凸起，脸上挂着戏谑的笑容。

"Wha-" he covered himself in a single, panicked movement.
"什-" 他慌乱中迅速地遮掩住自己。

"Do you want me…take care of that for you?" Asuka winked at him, her expression mixed with shame, nervousness, and excitement.
"你想让我…帮你处理那件事吗？" 明日香朝他眨了眨眼，表情中夹杂着羞涩、紧张和兴奋。

"Asuka…" Shinji took a deep breath, "are you lucid? Are you serious?"
明日香…" 真嗣深吸了一口气，"你清醒吗？你是认真的吗？

"Of course I am," she replied instantly. "What, why are you holding back? It's not like anyone can stop us now with Kaji and Misato absent. And I'm not suggesting intercourse, I could, you know," she trailed off, too embarrassed to say the word.
"我当然是认真的，" 她立刻回答道，"怎么，你还在犹豫什么？现在加持和美里都不在，没人能阻止我们。而且我也没说要发生关系，我可以，你知道的，" 她支支吾吾，羞于说出那个词。

"Um, but…I just don't want to…force you to do anything," Shinji cautiously chose his words.
"嗯，但是…我只是不想…强迫你做任何事，" 真嗣小心翼翼地选择着措辞。

"Ba-ka," Asuka huffed, another smirk crept up her face, "you aren't forcing me to do anything. I'm the one who wants it, alright? Don't tell me you don't want it because that's bullshit, I know you want me, you're just too conservative about it."
傻瓜," 明日香哼了一声，脸上又浮现出一丝坏笑，"你可没逼我做任何事。是我自己想要的，明白吗？别跟我说你不想，那都是瞎扯，我知道你想要我，只是你太保守了。

"O-okay, if you say so," seeing no more reasons to hold back, he reluctantly agreed. A quick glance at the clock, though, changed his course of action, "well, but it's almost time to see polar lights, maybe we can…do it at night?"
好吧，既然你这么说，" 看到没有理由再抗拒，他勉强同意了。但瞥了一眼时钟后，他的行动方向改变了，"嗯，不过快到看极光的时间了，或许我们可以……晚上再做？

Asuka pouted, "I suppose you're right," she gave in, putting on the red coat, "you need to wear more clothes too. Your long-sleeve won't do much against the wind up there."
明日香噘起嘴，"我想你是对的，" 她妥协了，穿上红色外套，"你也得多穿点衣服。你那长袖衫可挡不住上面的风。"

Shinji nodded and went to open his suitcase, taking out his own coat. He still needed to get used to a considerate Asuka. Not that he minded.
真嗣点头，走去打开自己的行李箱，拿出自己的外套。他还需要适应体贴的明日香。倒不是说他介意。

The Children stood on the observation deck next to one of the binoculars; the sky was completely dark due to polar night. There several other people on the observation deck with them, but not to the number Asuka thought it would be. Perhaps most of the sailors of this ship had already got bored of watching polar lights.
孩子们站在观测甲板上，旁边是一架望远镜；由于极夜，天空完全漆黑。甲板上还有其他几个人，但数量并没有明日香预想的那么多。或许这艘船上的大多数水手已经对观赏极光感到厌倦了。

Kaji and Misato stood not far away from them, exchanging affectionate gestures as they drowned in the adult world. "Shinji," Asuka started, staring out to the night sky, "do you know how does Aurora forms?"
加持和美里站在不远处，沉浸在成人世界的温情中，交换着爱意。“真嗣，”明日香开口道，凝视着夜空，“你知道极光是怎么形成的吗？”

"No, I haven't learned it in class," Shinji answered, scratching the back of his head.
“不，课堂上没学过，”真嗣回答，挠了挠后脑勺。

"Well, good that you have a genius at hand, right?" she boasted. "Listen up, so Auroras are produced by the combined effect of earth's magnetic field and the electrified high energy particles from the sun. Still with me?"
“还好你身边有个天才，对吧？”她自夸道。“听着，极光是由地球磁场和太阳高能带电粒子共同作用产生的。跟上我的思路了吗？”

"Wait, so you basically saying the earth is like a…giant magnet?" Shinji rubbed his temple, his brain trying to process the seemingly improbable statement, "how? I thought the earth is made of rocks."
等等，所以你基本上是说地球就像一个……巨大的磁铁？" 真嗣揉着太阳穴，大脑试图处理这个看似不可思议的说法，"怎么会呢？我以为地球是由岩石构成的。

"Gott, you really lack come proper education, I wonder what do they teach in school?" Asuka questioned; being a college graduate at the age of fourteen Asuka couldn't pay less attention to classes in school, not to mention her illiteracy when it came to reading kanji – a serious handicap that had been fixed only recently.
"天哪，你真的缺乏一些正规教育，我好奇学校里都教些什么？" 明日香质疑道；作为十四岁就大学毕业的她，对学校课程的关注度自然不高，更不用说她对汉字阅读的无知——这是一个最近才得到纠正的严重缺陷。

"Erm, you know, Sensei only talks about how-" he mouthed the word 'Second Impact' to her, who nodded an acknowledgment, "how it changed our lives, so on and so forth. And sensei in…sensei here talks about essentially the same stuff, just about the Financial Crisis."
呃，你知道，老师只讲关于如何——" 他对她口型说出"第二次冲击"这个词，她点头表示理解，"它如何改变了我们的生活，诸如此类。而这里的老师……讲的也基本是同样的内容，只是关于金融危机。

"Hmph, and yet you have six-day weeks," Asuka huffed, "I mean, what's the point of having long study hours if the education quality is so low?" She then realized the logic of her statement, "right. Precisely because of low education quality." She sighed before continuing, "anyway, where were we?"
哼，然而你们却有六天的工作周，" 明日香哼了一声，"我是说，如果教育质量这么低，那么长时间的学习有什么意义呢？" 她随即意识到自己话中的逻辑，"对，正是因为教育质量低。" 她叹了口气，然后继续说，"不管怎样，我们刚才说到哪儿了？

"Err, how the earth is a magnet?" Shinji wasn't a stereotypical nationalist; however, Asuka's remarks still stung a little. He was getting used to her berating of countries other than Germany, though.
"呃，地球怎么就是个磁铁了？" 真嗣并非那种典型的民族主义者，但明日香的言论还是让他有些刺痛。尽管如此，他已经开始习惯她对德国以外国家的批评了。

"Right. So, do you know the relationship between electricity and magnetism?" Asuka probed since she wanted to know where to start on her lectures. There were several ways for her to explain the whole mechanism - most of them included her referencing the Maxwell Equations.
"对了，那你知道电和磁之间的关系吗？" 明日香试探着问，因为她想知道从哪里开始她的讲解。有好几种方式可以解释整个机制——大多数都涉及到她引用麦克斯韦方程组。

"No?" Shinji replied, "I mean, assume I know nothing. Science and Physics are always my weak spots." In fact, if it wasn't for the constant NERV-related stuff, he could get a decent comprehension of the material of natural sciences. He wasn't stupid, as Asuka liked to call him.
"不知道？" 真嗣回答道，"我是说，就当我一无所知吧。科学和物理一直是我的弱项。" 事实上，如果不是因为 NERV 相关的事情不断，他本可以对自然科学的内容有不错的理解。他并不像明日香喜欢称呼的那样愚蠢。

"Fine. So electrical circuits could produce magnetic fields; I'm not getting into details here." Asuka explained, suspecting Shinji probably didn't even know what's a vector, much less the Faraday law of electromagnetic induction. "And earth's mantle just happen to have electrical circuits in it, which produce magnetic fields around the earth. That's why we have south pole and north pole on earth, they are basically two poles of the magnet." Said Asuka as she used her hand to mimic the earth, trying to explain it as vividly as possible, "you with me there?"
好吧。所以说，电路能产生磁场；这里我就不细讲了。" 明日香解释道，她怀疑真嗣可能连矢量是什么都不知道，更别提法拉第电磁感应定律了。"而地球的地幔中恰好有电路，它们在地球周围产生磁场。这就是为什么地球有南极和北极，它们基本上就是磁铁的两个极。" 明日香边说边用手比划着地球，尽可能生动地解释，"你跟上我的思路了吗？

"Yeah, I think I can understand," Shinji replied with an appreciative smile, "but how does it have anything to do with Auroras, though?"
嗯，我想我能理解，" 真嗣带着感激的微笑回答，"但极光和这有什么关系呢？

"In short, when the solar wind brings high energy particles to earth's upper atmosphere, earth's magnetic field will attract them to its poles, where the high energy particles ionize the atoms and molecules in air, creating Auroras," Asuka elucidated patiently. "Don't even ask about the process, I can't make it clear without pulling out half of my reserves of physics equations," she added as she saw Shinji opened his mouth with a questioning frown on his face.
"简而言之，当太阳风将高能粒子带到地球高层大气时，地球的磁场会将它们吸引到两极，在那里高能粒子使空气中的原子和分子电离，从而产生极光，" 明日香耐心地阐释。"别问过程了，不搬出我一半的物理方程储备，我可说不清楚，" 她补充道，因为看到真嗣张开嘴，脸上带着疑惑的皱眉。

"Um, okay," Shinji conceded, "thanks for the…education, though."
呃，好吧，" 真嗣勉强同意，"还是要谢谢你的……教育。

"Only because you're my boyfriend, I had the patience," Asuka smirked, "hey, if you think about it, the formation of Aurora is just like us."
要不是你是我男朋友，我可没这耐心，" 明日香得意地笑了笑，"嘿，你想想，极光的形成其实跟我们挺像的。

Shinji raised an eyebrow, "care to explain? I'm not very good at…metaphors," he smiled a sheepish smile.
真嗣挑了挑眉，"能解释一下吗？我对……比喻不太在行，" 他腼腆地笑了笑。

"Well, we always attract each other, even with our memories gone, we still end up being together, this permanent mutual attraction is just like the magnetic field and the electrified particles," Asuka went on, "and when we get together, we create the most beautiful bond in the world."
嗯，我们总是相互吸引，即使记忆消失了，我们还是会走到一起，这种永恒的相互吸引就像磁场和带电粒子一样，" 明日香继续说道，"而当我们在一起时，就创造了世界上最美的联系。

Shinji blushed at her choice of words; his face darkened a little as his insecurities crept up in his mind, "well… you're already the most beautiful when you were still…alone, Asuka," his shoulders slumped a little. "I still…sometimes don't know what did I do to deserve…you."
真嗣因她的话语而脸红；随着内心的不安悄然涌上心头，他的脸色略显阴沉，“嗯……你本就……独自一人时已是最美的，明日香，”他的肩膀微微下垂。“我仍然……有时不明白自己何德何能……拥有你。”

Asuka pouted, "Baka! Don't put yourself down!" She hissed, "you're just as wonderful as me, the great Asuka! We deserve each other for what we've both been through!" She continued, her eyes sparkled, her voice firm, "I'll never leave you, as long as you don't leave me! How did it go? 'In sickness and in health'?"
明日香噘起嘴，“笨蛋！别贬低自己！”她厉声说道，“你和我一样出色，伟大的明日香！我们经历了那么多，彼此都值得拥有对方！”她继续说着，眼中闪烁着光芒，语气坚定，“只要你别离开我，我永远不会离开你！怎么说来着？‘无论疾病还是健康’？”

Shinji was a bit startled by her sudden confession, "Asuka…are you going to…propose?" He said, but not without a smile, feeling much better than before as his insecurities vanished.
真嗣对她突如其来的表白有些惊讶，“明日香……你这是要……求婚吗？”他问道，脸上带着微笑，比之前感觉好多了，内心的不安已烟消云散。

"No, that's your job one day, and I was just trying to get the point through that thick skull of yours," she playfully berated him before her head suddenly snapped to another direction, "hey! Look! It's started!" She pointed her finger at the sky.
“不，那将来是你的任务，我只是想让你那榆木脑袋明白这一点，”她俏皮地责备他，随后突然转头望向另一边，“嘿！看！开始了！”她指向天空。

Shinji followed the direction and saw a sight he didn't want ever to forget – the colors emerged from the southern part of the night sky; it initially appeared as fluctuating flares, then the intensity and stability increased steadily as time went on. The greenish strands of lights twisted and twirled around like hunting vipers, stars hanging in the sky were their prey. Time disappeared for them as Shinji and Asuka watched the picturesque view above them as the beauty reflected in their eyes, their fingers intertwined.
真嗣顺着方向望去，看到了一幅他永生难忘的景象——色彩从夜空的南端涌现；起初看似波动的火焰，随后随着时间的推移，强度和稳定性逐渐增强。绿色的光带如狩猎的毒蛇般扭曲盘旋，天上的星星成了它们的猎物。时间对他们而言仿佛消失了，真嗣和明日香凝视着头顶如画的景色，美丽映照在他们的眼中，手指紧紧相扣。

After what felt like an eternity for them, the Auroras finally died down after blooming for the last time. "Shinji?" Asuka said softly with a dreamy look in her eyes, relishing in the memory of the spectacle she just witnessed.
仿佛经历了永恒，极光终于在最后一次绽放后渐渐消退。“真嗣？”明日香轻声说道，眼神梦幻，沉浸在刚刚目睹的奇观记忆中。

"Yes, Asuka?" Shinji responded, not noticing the fact that their faces were mere inches from each other. He turned to look at the most beautiful girl in the entire world, her eyes gleaming with love, joy, and a subtle hint of lust. He would bet his Cello that his eyes looked the same.
“嗯，明日香？”真嗣回应道，未察觉两人的脸庞仅相隔咫尺。他转头望向这世上最美的女孩，她的眼中闪烁着爱意、喜悦，以及一丝隐约的渴望。他敢打赌，自己的眼神也如出一辙。

"Let's go back to our room."
“我们回房间吧。”

Shinji and Asuka nearly attacked each other with kisses and touches as soon as they got in the door of their room, thick coats immediately flung away. After ten minutes of kissing shower, Asuka started stripping down her clothes with Shinji following her suit. It was not until Asuka started untying her bra that Shinji regained some of his restraint and suggested they should stop. He reluctantly pointed out that the walls are so thin to the extent that people could hear them two rooms away if they failed to contain their volume.
进屋的那一刻，真嗣和明日香几乎是用吻和触摸互相攻击，厚厚的外套立刻被甩到一边。经过十分钟的亲吻洗礼，明日香开始脱下衣服，真嗣也跟着效仿。直到明日香开始解开胸罩时，真嗣才恢复了一些自制力，提议他们应该停下来。他无奈地指出，墙壁太薄，如果他们控制不住声音，两间房外的人都能听见。

Asuka pouted, "Shinji, I can't care less about other people right now. We're basically going on a suicide mission, we could die tomorrow, for fuck's sake!" She reasoned, "so who cares if they hear us or not? They can go to hell for all I care." She chuckled as the realization hit her, "Actually, there's a big chance that they will go to hell tomorrow, well, maybe heaven, I don't know. So, what we can do is to enjoy the moment…while we still can, Shinji." She caressed his face, looking into his eyes, into his soul.
明日香撅起嘴，“真嗣，我现在才不在乎别人呢。我们基本上是在执行自杀任务，明天就可能死了，该死的！”她辩解道，“所以他们听不听得到又有什么关系？他们爱咋咋地，我不在乎。”她笑着意识到，“实际上，他们明天有很大可能会下地狱，嗯，也可能是天堂，我不知道。所以，我们能做的就是享受当下……趁我们还能享受，真嗣。”她抚摸着他的脸，凝视着他的眼睛，深入他的灵魂。

Shinji pondered for a moment; no matter embarrassing this might be, Asuka was making a valid point. He didn't want to die without…enjoying his life first, either. "As you wish, Asuka." He said tenderly and took off his clothes.
真嗣沉思了片刻；尽管这可能令人尴尬，但明日香确实言之有理。他也不想在未曾享受生活之前就死去。“如你所愿，明日香。”他温柔地说着，脱下了衣服。

One Hour Later (This is not a lemon you perverts!)
一小时后（这不是你们这些变态想的那些内容！）

"Gott, that was…Gott," Asuka panted heavily as she sprawled over Shinji's body, her face flushing, "we…we should do this more often." She blurted out, her blush deepened in shame as her words reached the conscious brain.
“天哪，那真是……天哪，”明日香气喘吁吁地趴在真嗣身上，脸颊绯红，“我们……我们应该多做这种事。”她脱口而出，话一出口，羞耻感加深了她的脸红，意识到了自己的直言不讳。

"Yeah, that was…wow," Shinji wrapped his arms around her waist, planting a soft kiss on her neck, who purred in response, "you even had protection with you…and you always call me a pervert," he joked, eliciting a pout from the redhead.
“是啊，那真是……哇，”真嗣双臂环抱住她的腰，在她脖子上轻轻一吻，她则发出满足的咕噜声回应，“你甚至还随身带着防护措施……你还总说我变态，”他打趣道，惹得红发少女撅起了嘴。

"C'mon, you don't get to complain," Asuka huffed, "unless you-"
得了吧，你没资格抱怨，"明日香气呼呼地说，"除非你——

A voice from outside the door cut her off, "Shinji! Asuka! Are you in there?" Misato Katsuragi's worried voice came to them. They sprang to their feet and scrambled apart, hastily putting on some clothes and trying to hide red faces and mussed hair. "May I come in? You did go to go to dinner, I'm worried about you guys!"
门外传来一个声音打断了她，"真嗣！明日香！你们在里面吗？" 葛城美里焦急的声音传了进来。他们立刻跳起来，匆忙分开，急忙穿上衣服，试图掩饰通红的脸颊和凌乱的头发。"我可以进来吗？你们不是要去吃晚饭吗，我很担心你们！"

"We're busy!" Asuka shouted to the door, silently blessing the fact that Misato sounded utterly oblivious of the debauchery that had just transpired. Shinji, on the other hand, looked like he just wanted to dig a hole in the ground and vanish.
"我们正忙着呢！"明日香对着门喊道，暗自庆幸美里听起来完全不知道刚刚发生的荒唐事。而真嗣则一副恨不得在地上挖个洞钻进去的样子。

"Oh? Busy?" Misato's started her teasing mode, "you aren't doing anything naughty, are you?"
哦？忙着呢？"美里开启了调侃模式，"你们没在做什么坏事吧？

"We are not!" Asuka retorted, an evil grin appeared on her face as she realized how technically true her statement was – they 'are' not, but they were. "Have some decency, alright?! We are just watching movies together!" She improvised, putting on her shirt.
"我们才不是呢！"明日香反驳道，脸上露出一抹邪恶的笑容，意识到自己的话在技术上确实没错——他们'确实'不是，但他们的确在一起。"有点分寸好不好？！我们只是在一块儿看电影！"她边说边套上衬衫。

"Hmm, if you say so," Misato conceded uncharacteristically easily, "seriously though, you need to have dinner!"
嗯，既然你这么说，"美里出乎意料地轻易让步，"不过说真的，你们得去吃晚饭了！

"Hai, hai!" Asuka sighed in defeat, "we'll go after we wrap it up!"
好啦，好啦！"明日香叹了口气，败下阵来，"收拾完就去！

Dinner – unsurprisingly – was consisted of all seafood. Considering the only other option was canned MREs, the Children didn't really have a choice. With the frustration and anxiety about the upcoming endgame momentarily flushed away by comfort and satisfaction brought to them by physical intimacy, the Children lay on their bed under the same sheet with Asuka snuggled into her lover's chest. At the same time, the said boy wrapped his arms around his favorite redhead, their legs intertwined with each other.
晚餐——不出所料——全是海鲜。考虑到唯一的选择就是罐装即食食品，孩子们其实没得选。因即将到来的决战而生的烦躁与焦虑，暂时被亲密接触带来的舒适与满足冲刷一空，孩子们躺在床上，同盖一床被，明日香依偎在爱人的胸膛。与此同时，那个男孩也环抱着他最爱的红发女孩，两人的腿交缠在一起。

"Shinji…" Asuka started, looking into his eyes, "are you scared?" She asked, her voice carried a hint of uncertainty.
"真嗣…" 明日香开口道，凝视着他的眼睛，"你害怕吗？" 她问道，声音中带着一丝不确定。

"I've never been so scared in my life, Asuka," Shinji replied, his voice broke a little, "I wasn't even this scared when I first time stepped into an EVA. I…I don't want to lose you."
我这辈子从没这么害怕过，明日香，" 真嗣回答，声音有些颤抖，"我第一次坐进 EVA 时都没这么害怕。我…我不想失去你。

"Me neither," Asuka's voice instantly turned sorrowful, "I-I-" she stammered, not sure what to say; she pondered a moment and continued, "Shinji, promise me something."
我也是，" 明日香的声音立刻变得悲伤起来，"我-我-" 她结巴着，不知该说什么好；她沉思片刻后继续说道，"真嗣，答应我一件事。

"Anything for you, Asuka," his reply was immediate, his voice uncharacteristically firm.
"为了你，我什么都愿意，明日香，" 他的回答毫不犹豫，声音异常坚定。

Asuka let out a long breath, "I-If I d-die when the time comes, promise me you'll… you'll move on with your life," she managed out, her voice shaky.
明日香长长地呼出一口气，“我-我如果到时候死了，你-你答应我，你会……你会继续你的生活，”她勉强说出这句话，声音颤抖。

"Asuka…what do you mean?" Shinji frowned, taken aback by her solemn words.
“明日香……你这是什么意思？” 真嗣皱起眉头，被她严肃的话语弄得措手不及。

"Even without me, you can still find happiness in your life," she fought back the tears threatened to come out the corner of her eyes, "promise me that, okay?"
“即使没有我，你也能在你的生活中找到幸福，”她强忍着泪水，不让它们从眼角溢出，“答应我，好吗？”

Shinji closed his eyes and took a deep breath, "Asuka…" he reopened his eyes and locked his gaze with Asuka's, cobalt met cerulean, "you're not dying on my watch, Asuka, and if you are…" he trailed off as he saw Asuka's unreadable expression; a stampede of thoughts rushed through his head. How could he promise something like that? He was sure he would literally disintegrate if she died."And if you are, I'd rather die alongside you."
真嗣闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，“明日香……”他重新睁开眼，目光与明日香的交汇，钴蓝对上蔚蓝，“在我眼前，你不会死去，明日香，如果你真的……”他话音未落，看到明日香难以捉摸的表情；思绪如野马奔腾。他怎能做出那样的承诺？他确信，如果她死去，他也会随之崩溃。“如果你真的要走，我宁愿与你同去。”

"And doom the whole world?" Asuka said half-mockingly, half-surprised.
"难道要毁灭整个世界吗？"明日香半是嘲讽半是惊讶地说道。

"You are my world, Asuka," he blurted out with a faint blush; to say his words had an effect on the redhead would be a huge understatement; Asuka simply melt.
"你就是我的世界，明日香，"他脱口而出，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕；要说他的话对这位红发少女没有影响，那绝对是夸大其词；明日香简直融化了。

"B-Baka, you are always like this," she sobbed, disguised as a chuckle, "Gott…we… you're just like me…" Asuka had nothing other than EVA in the early stages of her life; with the EVAs gone, she had nothing to act as a crutch to support her fragile self-recognition. Right now she had Shinji – someone could emphasize with her, someone who could understand her – and Shinji only, her sole support, the first person to make her feel loved after her momma died.
"笨蛋，你总是这样，"她哽咽着，强装笑意，"天啊…我们…你就像我一样…"在生命的早期阶段，明日香除了 EVA 一无所有；随着 EVA 的消失，她失去了支撑自己脆弱自我认知的拐杖。现在她有了真嗣——一个能与她共情，能理解她的人——只有真嗣，她唯一的依靠，自母亲去世后第一个让她感受到爱的人。

He was her world as well, just like she was his world.
她也是他的世界，正如他是她的世界一样。

For normal people, it's called a relationship; for Shinji and Asuka, arguably the two loneliest people in the world, it's called codependency.
对普通人而言，这叫恋爱；对真嗣和明日香来说，这两个或许是世界上最孤独的人，这只能称之为相互依赖。

There were no more words said between them, because no more words were needed.
他们之间再无言语，因为已无需更多言语。

To say that Asuka Langley Soryu was a stranger to overthinking was to say Antarctica was a grassland. 'Was this the best thing to do?' A scenario started to play in her head. It started with Adam exploding, her seeing Shinji died to protect her, her heart filled with all the things she wanted to say but never did. She shook it off. Another one took its place. Another explosion, another death, another scream – but this time of vengeance, of her tearing every single person involved in this apart, by her bare hands. She smiled through her tears.
要说惣流·明日香·兰格雷不会胡思乱想，那简直就像说南极是一片草原一样荒谬。'这样做真的最好吗？'一个场景在她脑海中展开。起初是亚当爆炸，她目睹真嗣为保护她而死，心中充满了那些想说却从未说出口的话。她摇摇头，驱散了这个念头。另一个场景取而代之。又一次爆炸，又一次死亡，又一次尖叫——但这次是复仇的呐喊，她要用自己的双手将每一个与此事有关的人撕成碎片。她含泪微笑。

Others kept coming. By the time she drifted to sleep, Shinji had already died a dozen times, and she had died as many times herself.
这样的幻想不断涌现。直到她入睡时，真嗣已经死了十几次，而她自己也同样经历了那么多次死亡。

Asuka wasn't even surprised when she found herself standing on the flight deck of Over the Rainbow when she opened her eyes. Shinji stood right next to her, his hands subconsciously found hers, interlocking their fingers.
当明日香睁开眼睛，发现自己站在“彩虹之上”的飞行甲板上时，她甚至没有感到惊讶。真嗣就站在她旁边，他的手不自觉地找到了她的，手指交缠在一起。

To both of their surprises, this time there were two cloaked figures floating down to the deck. The two of them stood side by side, just like Shinji and Asuka.
令两人惊讶的是，这次有两个披着斗篷的身影缓缓降落到甲板上。他们并肩而立，就像真嗣和明日香一样。

"Um, hello?" Shinji greeted nervously.
"呃，你们好？" 真嗣紧张地打招呼。

"Hello, Shinji. Hello, Asuka," the cloaked figure on the left spoke in a voice too familiar to both of the Children, "the endgame is coming, so I reckon you two at least deserve the truth." He turned to look at the other cloaked figure; they nodded in unison before raising their hands to the edges of their capes. With a whoosh the cape fell on the flight deck, the human silhouettes inside them appeared to Shinji and Asuka for the first time.
"你好，真嗣。你好，明日香。" 左边那位披着斗篷的身影用一种对两位少年来说过于熟悉的声音说道，"终局将至，我想你们至少有权知道真相。" 他转向另一位披着斗篷的身影；他们同时点头，然后举起手来，掀开斗篷的边缘。随着一声呼啸，斗篷落在飞行甲板上，里面的人影第一次清晰地呈现在真嗣和明日香眼前。

The Children gasped, mouth agape in shock, their eyes went wide.
孩子们倒吸一口凉气，惊得目瞪口呆，眼睛瞪得溜圆。

"We're sorry for the surprise," said the God Shinji with an apologetic smile; the God Asuka continued, "but it's time for the truth."
“我们为这突如其来的真相道歉，”神明真嗣带着歉意的微笑说道；神明明日香接着说，“但现在是揭露真相的时候了。”

### Chapter 12: Endgame

"It's time for the truth."
是时候揭露真相了。

Shinji and Asuka stared at the other pair incredulously, "wha-p-prophesier?"
真嗣和明日香难以置信地盯着另一对，"什-什-预言者？"

The God Shinji chuckled, "you can call me 'Shinji Soryu' if you want, Shinji Ikari."
神真嗣轻笑一声，"如果你想的话，可以叫我'真嗣·索龙'，碇真嗣。"

"Shinji S-" Shinji's eyes went wide. He looked at Asuka standing beside him, they both blushed deep red as the realization hit them, "j-just who are you?"
真嗣 S-" 真嗣的眼睛瞪得老大。他看向站在旁边的明日香，两人都因为突然的领悟而脸红得像熟透的苹果，"你…你到底是谁？

"It's a long story…" the God Asuka started, "in short, we are the former you, when you were EVA pilots."
说来话长…" 神化的明日香开口道，"简单来说，我们是曾经的你们，在你们还是 EVA 驾驶员的时候。

"Subconscious my ass…" Asuka huffed, rubbing her chin, "you're telling me – Shinji and I lost the nine months of memories because we weren't the ones who experienced them?"
潜意识个鬼…" 明日香气呼呼地揉着下巴，"你的意思是——我和真嗣失去了那九个月的记忆，是因为我们根本就没有经历过那些事？

"Essentially." 基本上是这样。

"But how?" 但这是怎么回事？

"It's complicated…" the God Shinji sighed, "long story short, we were somehow sent to this universe by some God, and we…replaced you," he carefully shoes his words, "when we became Gods as well-"
这很复杂…" 神之真嗣叹息道，"简而言之，我们不知怎么被某位神明送到了这个宇宙，并且我们…取代了你们，" 他小心翼翼地斟酌着措辞，"当我们也成为神的时候——

"Wait a second here, you became WHAT?!" Asuka cried.
"等一下，你们成了什么？！" 明日香惊呼。

"Gods, literally," the God Asuka smirked, "Instrumentality made us Gods."
神，字面意义上的，" 神之明日香得意地笑道，"人类补完计划让我们成为了神。

"Instru-I'm not even gonna ask what it is," Asuka muttered, "why can't I get so lucky…"
Instru-我甚至都不想问那是什么，"明日香嘟囔着，"为什么我就没那么幸运……

"So…how are we…going to stop Second Impact?" Shinji probed, still digesting the shocking information.
"那么……我们……要怎么阻止第二次冲击？" 真嗣试探着问，仍在消化这令人震惊的信息。

"You two both possess dormant S2 organs just like Angels do," the God Asuka declared; before any of the other pair could ask, she continued, "don't worry, you're not Angels. But the S2 organ is the key to stop the Second Impact, or at least we thought it is."
你们两个都拥有像天使一样的休眠 S2 器官，"神明日香宣布道；在另外两人能发问之前，她继续说，"别担心，你们不是天使。但 S2 器官是阻止第二次冲击的关键，至少我们曾这么认为。

"Oh…that sounds…disturbing, having Angelic Powers, I mean," Asuka mused, "wait, does that mean I can wield my AT-Field like Angels do?"
哦……听起来……挺让人不安的，拥有天使般的力量，我是说，"明日香沉思道，"等等，那是不是意味着我也能像天使那样操控 AT 场？

"Pretty much, but you can't right now since your S2 organs are still dormant."
基本上是这样，但现在你还做不到，因为你的 S2 器官尚未激活。

"When will it activate then?"
那它什么时候会启动呢？

"We believe as soon as Adam awakens, your S2 organs will activate."
我们相信，一旦亚当苏醒，你的 S2 器官就会随之激活。

"So…somehow we use our Angelic powers to…kill Adam when it awakens?"
也就是说……我们得用天使之力，在亚当苏醒时将其消灭？

"That would be the most reasonable solution," the God Asuka said warily, "the truth is even us have no idea how to actually defeat it." She shrugged.
"那将是最合理的解决方案，"神明飞鸟谨慎地说道，"事实上，就连我们也不知道如何真正击败它。"她耸了耸肩。

"What we could do though…is to give back, or rather, send you our memories," the God Shinji followed, "this way you would know how to fight using your AT-Fields, and to see what actually happened during those times. I have to warn you, though, there was something not so…pleasant that took place. It's up to you whether or not to receive the memories."
但我们能做的……是归还，或者更确切地说，将我们的记忆传递给你，"神明真嗣接着说，"这样你就会知道如何使用你的 AT 场战斗，以及那些时期究竟发生了什么。不过我得提醒你，有些事情并不那么……愉快。是否接受这些记忆，由你决定。

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other - worries, reassurances, and determination were exchanged without a word - and nodded in unison.
真嗣和飞鸟对视一眼——忧虑、安慰与决心在无声中传递——然后齐齐点头。

"Okay. Get ready." 好的。准备好了。

As 'their' memories rushed into their minds, a series of images flashed before Shinji and Asuka's eyes. They saw everything that had happened during the nine months – the Angel fights, the interactions between them, how Asuka came back alive several times using her Angelic powers.
当“他们”的记忆涌入脑海，一系列画面在真嗣和明日香眼前闪现。他们目睹了过去九个月里发生的一切——与使徒的战斗、彼此间的互动，以及明日香如何多次借助她的使徒力量死而复生。

The massive amount of information temporarily sent the Children into a state of shock as their brains were put on the edge of processing capabilities. Shinji and Asuka wandered around in their mind world for almost half an hour before finally coming down from their frozen state.
海量的信息暂时让孩子们陷入了震惊，他们的大脑几乎达到了处理能力的极限。真嗣和明日香在心灵世界中徘徊了近半个小时，才终于从僵直状态中恢复过来。

"Sh-Shinji," Asuka started first, seizing his hand, "I-I can't believe it…"
“真、真嗣，”明日香首先开口，紧紧抓住他的手，“我、我简直不敢相信……”

"M-me neither, Asuka," Shinji returned the grip just as forcefully, "I…I still need some time."
“我、我也是，明日香，”真嗣同样用力地回握，“我……我还需要一些时间。”

"We will give you all the time you need to digest the information," the God Shinji said with a smile, "time is almost up, you guys should wake up. I'm sure we'll meet again in the future."
我们会给你所有你需要的时间来消化这些信息，"神之真嗣微笑着说，"时间快到了，你们该醒来了。我相信将来我们还会再见面的。

Shinji and Asuka opened their eyes at the same time; the first thing they did after they woke up was to hold each other in a tight embrace, seeking reassurance and a grip on reality.
真嗣和明日香同时睁开眼睛；醒来后他们做的第一件事就是紧紧拥抱彼此，寻求安慰和现实的把握。

"Shinji..." Asuka said, "Now that all of my questions are answered...but it's still hard to believe..."
真嗣..." 明日香说，"现在我的所有疑问都得到了解答...但仍然难以置信...

"Asuka I-" 明日香我-

"Don't," she interrupted, "we'll talk about this...if we make it out alive."
别说了，" 她打断道，"这事我们出去再说...如果我们能活着出去的话。

Shinji nodded. The Children got up from the bed and started their morning routine.
真嗣点了点头。孩子们从床上起来，开始他们的早晨例行公事。

The breakfast was eaten in awkward silence as both Shinji and Asuka had a turmoil of thoughts in their minds.
早餐在尴尬的沉默中进行，真嗣和明日香心中都思绪万千。

"Oh, you guys are already up," came Naoko Akagi's voice, snapping them out of their trains of thoughts, "I'll get straight into business. We have a simulator test prepared for you guys here. The helicopter takes off in one hour, get ready and pack your stuff!"
哦，你们已经起来了，" 赤木直子的声音传来，打断了他们的思绪，"那我就直奔主题了。我们为你们准备了一个模拟器测试。直升机一小时后起飞，准备好并收拾好你们的行李！

The Children didn't even acknowledge that they heard her.
孩子们甚至没有表现出他们听到了她的话。

XXXXXX

The research station was covered in snow, looking more like a gigantic military fortress when observed from the helicopter. Dozens of turrets, cruise missile launchers, and SM-3 anti-air missile grounds spread across the area, indicating the unusualness of this place.
研究站被雪覆盖，从直升机上观察，更像是一座巨大的军事堡垒。数十座炮塔、巡航导弹发射器和 SM-3 防空导弹阵地遍布四周，显示出这个地方的不寻常。

Shinji and Asuka were in thick down jackets and expedition parkas, walking towards the front gate of the research base hand in hand, determination written on their young faces. "Why you guys look so nervous? It's just a simple test," Naoko Akagi reassured, truly hoping it could be just that. "One hour at most. C'mon, you've already done this before. Several times."
真嗣和明日香穿着厚重的羽绒服和探险派克大衣，手牵手走向研究基地的大门，年轻的脸上写满了决心。“你们为什么看起来这么紧张？这只是一次简单的测试，”赤木直子安慰道，真心希望事情能如此简单。“最多一个小时。来吧，你们以前已经做过好几次了。”

The Children ignored her reassurance and continued marching forward. Kaji was nowhere to be seen, perhaps having fun adult time with Misato somewhere remote. The Two couldn't care less about his whereabouts that time; if they screwed up their task at hand, all people in the surrounding area would be dead, not to mention the world would be loomed over by the fear of Angels again.
孩子们对她的安慰置若罔闻，继续向前行进。加持不见踪影，可能在某个偏僻的地方与美里享受成人时光。那时，两人根本不在乎他的下落；如果他们搞砸了手头的任务，周围所有的人都将丧命，更不用说世界将再次笼罩在使徒的恐惧之下。

The inside of the base was no simpler than the Geofront in terms of pathfinding. The labyrinth-like walkways and thoroughfares left the Children no hope of finding the way out by themselves. Somehow Dr. Akagi could wander around the maze as if the walls were transparent.
基地内部的复杂程度丝毫不亚于 Geofront，迷宫般的通道和走廊让孩子们自己找到出路几乎无望。不知何故，赤木博士却能在迷宫中自如穿梭，仿佛墙壁对她而言是透明的。

The testing chamber was no much unlike the one in Gehirn Japan, just clearly had more advanced equipment – some of them even Asuka couldn't identify – and a monstrous signal tower standing beside it.
测试室与日本 Gehirn 的设施颇为相似，只是设备明显更为先进——有些甚至明日香也认不出来——旁边还矗立着一座巨大的信号塔。

The bridge bunnies were there with them today; several unfamiliar technicians sat around the terminals, typing furiously as they made the last preparations before the final test.
今天，舰桥上的操作员们也在场；几位陌生的技术人员围坐在终端前，手指飞快地敲击键盘，为最终测试前的最后准备忙碌着。

"The changing room is just around the corner, go and change on your plugsuits," one of the technicians said to the Children in a professional voice, albeit devoid of any emotions. Shinji and Asuka exchanged a resolute glance, walking to the room.
“更衣室就在拐角处，去换上你们的插入栓服吧，”一位技术人员用专业的口吻对孩子们说道，尽管语气中不带任何情感。真嗣和明日香交换了一个坚定的眼神，向房间走去。

"Asuka…" Shinji started as they entered the room and closed the door, "I-if anything happens…just remember that I love you, more than anything in this world-"
明日香…" 进房间并关上门后，真嗣开口道，"我-我是说，万一发生什么…记得我爱你，比这世上任何事物都要深-

Asuka put a finger on his lips, shutting him up, "I know, Baka-Shinji. And I love you too, as much as you love me." She lowered her finger and pulled him into a soft, but long-lasting kiss, a kiss that's full of love. "Shinji, I-"
明日香将手指轻放在他的唇上，制止了他，"我知道，笨蛋真嗣。我也爱你，就像你爱我一样深。" 她移开手指，将他拉入一个温柔而绵长的吻，充满爱意的吻。"真嗣，我-"

The lights in the room went off abruptly, scaring the Children a little. "Oh c'mon, the most advanced base in the world, and they couldn't even-"
房间里的灯光突然熄灭，让两位少年有些惊慌。"拜托，这可是世界上最先进的基地，他们居然连-"

BOOM

Her speech was cut off by the loud sound of an explosion. The entire changing room shook violently under the powerful C4 blast. Both of the Children lost their balance and fell to the ground; Asuka got up on her feet first, rushing to the door, ignoring the fact that her clothes were half taken off.
她的话被一声巨响打断，剧烈的 C4 爆炸震动了整个更衣室。两位少年失去平衡摔倒在地；明日香率先站起身，冲向门口，全然不顾自己半脱的衣物。

Just as she was about to open the door, dozens of holes abruptly appeared on the door accompanied by the continuous sounds of 5.56 mm cartridge explosions. Fortunately the bullets lost most of their momentum after they went through the metal door, added the fast reaction of the redhead she didn't get hit.
正当她准备开门之际，门上突然出现了数十个弹孔，伴随着 5.56 毫米子弹连续爆炸的声响。幸好子弹穿透金属门后已失去大部分动能，加之红发少女反应迅速，她并未被击中。

Shinji stood up as well; Asuka grabbed his wrist and dragged him into hiding behind the thick metal wall of the changing room, hoping it would block the near-sonic-speed small metal chunks. "Don't move!" "Put your hands up in the air!" "Drop your weapons!" Several shouted commands could be heard from outside the room, supposedly not directed at the Children.
真嗣也站起身来；明日香抓住他的手腕，将他拽到更衣室厚重的金属墙后躲避，希望它能挡住那些接近音速的小金属碎片。"别动！""举起手来！""放下武器！"房间外传来几声命令，显然不是针对孩子们的。

"What the hell?" Asuka muttered to herself and Shinji after the noise outside subsided. "Is this an armed invasion or something?"
这到底是怎么回事？"待外面的嘈杂声平息后，明日香自言自语地问真嗣。"难道是武装入侵什么的？

"I-I don't k-know…" was all Shinji's shell-shocked brain could articulate at the moment.
"我...我不知道..."真嗣此刻惊魂未定的大脑只能勉强挤出这几个字。

Suddenly the door was kicked open and several red dots immediately pointed at Asuka's head, Shinji as well. The soldiers wore black uniforms and looked-advanced tactical helmets that had flashlights, portable HUDs, and NVDs mounted on them. The Children, instead of showing fear, had looks of resolve on their faces. At least they could die together, and the contact experiment would be abandoned without them.
突然，门被猛地踹开，几个红色光点立刻指向了明日香和真嗣的头部。士兵们身着黑色制服，头戴先进的战术头盔，上面装有手电筒、便携式抬头显示器和夜视设备。孩子们并未流露出恐惧，反而面露决绝之色。至少他们能一同赴死，而没有他们的接触实验也将被迫放弃。

"We've located the target, both alive and safe," one of the soldiers said into his portable communicator.
"目标已定位，两人均存活且安全。" 一名士兵对着便携式通讯器报告道。

Another husky man entered the room. He only wore an individual light bulletproof vest, carrying a SCAR assault rifle in his hand. And his face-
另一位魁梧的男子走进房间，仅穿着轻便的单兵防弹背心，手中提着一把 SCAR 突击步枪。而他的面容——

The Children's eyes went wide.
孩子们的眼睛瞪得老大。

"KAJI-SAN?!" Shinji and Asuka exclaimed in unison.
"KAJI-SAN?!" 真嗣和明日香异口同声地惊呼道。

Kaji Ryoji gestured the soldiers around him to put down their guns, "hello kiddos, sorry if they scared you," he showed an apologetic smile. "Long story short, our…organization noticed the secret plan of Gehirn, and we took action before they could initiate their evil plan."
加持良治示意周围的士兵放下枪支，"嗨，小朋友们，如果吓到你们了，抱歉啊，" 他露出一个歉意的微笑。"简单来说，我们……组织察觉到了 Gehirn 的秘密计划，所以在他们启动邪恶计划之前，我们采取了行动。"

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other incredulously. After all that they've been through and prepared for, their problem was easily resolved by other people who didn't even know the tip of the iceberg of the truth?!
真嗣和明日香难以置信地互望一眼。经历了那么多，做好了万全准备，结果他们的问题竟被一群对真相一无所知的人轻易解决了？！

Not that they minded it.
倒也不是说他们对此有什么不满。

"Do you know what you're brought here for?" Kaji asked while other soldiers left the room to establish a perimeter. "Except doing some kind of test?"
你知道为什么把你带到这里来吗？" 薰一边问，一边看着其他士兵离开房间去建立警戒线。"除了进行某种测试之外？

"Yeah, more or less," Asuka replied, putting on her thick clothes, "judging from the scene, they couldn't be doing something beneficial to humanity, right?!" She scoffed.
"嗯，八九不离十，" 明日香回答着，穿上厚重的衣物，"看这阵势，他们不可能是在做对人类有益的事吧？！" 她嗤之以鼻。

Kaji chuckled, "yeah, I'll share the details once we get home. Now let's get out of here first."
薰轻笑一声，"是啊，等我们回家再详细告诉你。现在先离开这里再说。"

Shinji and Asuka followed him, walking out of the room; they cringed as some of the soldiers looked at them strangely. Several bodies of the technicians lay around the area, the air filled with the smell of blood and gunpowder. "Kaji-san, how do you know about all this?" Shinji probed as they walked through a large chamber.
真嗣和明日香跟着他，走出房间；当一些士兵用奇怪的眼神打量他们时，他们不禁皱起了眉头。周围散落着几具技术人员的尸体，空气中弥漫着血腥味和火药味。"薰先生，你怎么会知道这些的？" 真嗣在他们穿过一个巨大的舱室时追问道。

"I spied on Gehirn. With a little…technical help from my organization, I could hack into the MAGI and download all of the files."
我监视了 Gehirn。借助组织的一点……技术支持，我得以侵入 MAGI 并下载了所有文件。

"Wow…" Shinji answered, a stampede of thoughts rampaged through his mind. Gehirn must know he and Asuka's true nature, right? At least part of it. This meant…the secret organization would also know about it. "Kaji-san…did the files say anything about Asuka and me?"
哇……" 真嗣回答道，脑海中思绪如狂潮般汹涌。Gehirn 肯定知道他和明日香的真正身份，对吧？至少部分是。这意味着……那个秘密组织也会知晓此事。"加持先生……文件里有提到我和明日香吗？

Kaji's expression turned ponderous, rubbing his temple, "well, they did…but nothing critical, I suppose-oh hi, Yamashi, what're you doing here? I thought you were assigned to sector B02." He said to a man in front of them, who had one of his hands behind his back.
加持的表情变得沉思起来，他揉着太阳穴说："嗯，确实有……但我想没什么关键的——哦，你好，山石，你怎么在这儿？我以为你被分配到 B02 区域了。" 他对站在他们面前的一个男人说道，那人一只手藏在背后。

"I'm here to finish what's unfinished," Yamashi said in a hoarse voice, his expression unreadable.
"我来完成未竟之事，" 山石用沙哑的声音说道，表情难以捉摸。

Suddenly he raised his hand that was behind his back; a 9. mm semiautomatic grabbed firmly in his hand.
突然，他抬起藏在背后的手；一把 9 毫米半自动手枪紧紧握在手中。

"DIE!" 去死吧！

Before either of the Children could react, he aimed at Asuka, who was standing in front of Shinji, and fired.
两个孩子还未来得及反应，他便瞄准了站在真嗣前面的明日香，扣动了扳机。

BANG BANG BANG 砰砰砰

One of the three rounds missed and impacted the railing, sparkling as it hit. The second bullet hit Asuka's left arm. The third bullet, being the best-aimed one among all three, struck the center of the redhead's chest. The thick expedition parkas and jackets did nothing to slow the bullet down as it ripped through them.
其中一发子弹打偏，击中栏杆，溅起火花。第二发子弹击中了明日香的左臂。而第三发子弹，是三发中瞄准最精准的，正中红发少女的胸口中央。厚重的探险派克大衣和夹克丝毫未能减缓子弹的速度，任其撕裂而过。

In a blink of an eye, Kaji dashed forward and subdued the attacker, kicking the gun away. "YOU ALIEN MONSTERS! GO BACK TO HELL! AHHH!"
眨眼间，加持冲上前制服了袭击者，一脚将枪踢开。"你们这些外星怪物！滚回地狱去！啊啊啊！"

Apparently the secret organization knew more than Kaji told the Children how much they knew.
显然，那个秘密组织所知远超加持告诉孩子们的他们所了解的程度。

"Asuka?" Shinji said shakily as he saw the love of his life fell to the ground, blood dripping through her mouth and the hole before her chest. "ASUKA!" He cried, dashing to the side of the girl, holding her in his arms.
"明日香？" 当看到心爱的人倒在地上，口中和胸前的伤口鲜血直流时，真嗣颤抖着说。"明日香！" 他哭喊着，冲到女孩身边，将她紧紧抱在怀里。

Asuka's eyes slowly focused on him, "Shin…Shinji…" she tried to smile but failed, "I…so…sorry…" a tear rolled down her pale face.
明日香的眼睛缓缓聚焦在他身上，“真…真嗣…”她试图微笑却未能成功，“我…真…抱歉…”一滴泪水从她苍白的脸颊滑落。

Shinji took her right hand, holding it with both of his hands tightly. He could feel life slipping away from his love. "Asuka! Stay with me! Please…" He said between sobs, tears already freely flowing down his face.
真嗣握住她的右手，用双手紧紧地握着。他能感觉到生命正从他心爱的人身上流逝。“明日香！留在我身边！求你了…”他哽咽着说，泪水已不受控制地顺着脸颊流淌。

Asuka let out a weak chuckle that came out as a cough, "b-baka, I…I don't th-think I'm go-" she trailed off, her arm went limp as her eyes unfocused; her chest stopped rising and falling.
明日香发出一声虚弱的轻笑，却变成了咳嗽，“笨…笨蛋，我…我不觉得我还能…”她的话音渐渐消失，手臂无力地垂下，眼神失去焦点；她的胸膛停止了起伏。

Asuka was gone. 明日香离开了。

"NOOOOOOO!" 不！！！！！

Shinji screamed. His eyes glowed.
真嗣尖叫着，他的眼睛闪烁着光芒。

The ground shook. 地面震动起来。

"High energy readings coming from below the ice layers!" One of Kaji's technicians shouted as he checked his military laptop. "It's…human!"
冰层下方检测到高能量读数！" 一名跟随卡吉的技术人员一边检查着军用笔记本电脑一边喊道，"那是……人类！

All people in the area stared dumfounded at the rising white giant that just rose from below thick layers of ice. Its body went through matters like there were nothing there.
该地区所有的人都目瞪口呆地望着那个刚从厚厚冰层下升起的白色巨物。它的身躯穿越物质，仿佛无物阻挡。

Shinji continued to scream.
真嗣继续尖叫着。

XXXXXX

Asuka slowly opened her eyes, finding herself floating in an endless white void. 'Am I…dead?' She thought sadly, 'Is this…heaven?'
明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己漂浮在一个无边无际的白色虚空中。'我...死了吗？' 她悲伤地想，'这里...是天堂吗？'

No this is not. 不，并非如此。

Asuka frowned as a strangely familiar voice sounded in her head, "who are you?" She shouted into the void.
明日香皱起眉头，一个异常熟悉的声音在她脑海中响起，“你是谁？”她对着虚空大声问道。

Suddenly a silver-haired boy showed up in front of her, smirking.
突然，一个银发少年出现在她面前，嘴角挂着一抹微笑。

"T-Tabris?!" Asuka exclaimed in surprise, "how-"
“塔布里斯？！”明日香惊讶地喊道，“怎么——”

The boy chuckled, "I'm not Tabris, I am Adam. I only borrowed his form since I deem this is more familiar to you."
少年轻笑一声，“我不是塔布里斯，我是亚当。我只是借用了他的外形，因为我觉得这样对你来说更熟悉。”

"Wait, how? Adam?!" Asuka raised an eyebrow, "we didn't initiate the contact experiment, then how did you-"
等等，怎么回事？亚当？！" 明日香挑起眉毛，"我们并没有启动接触实验，那你是怎么——

"The activation of my kin's soul barrier awoke me," Adam explained, "interesting. He's similar to me, but he's not exactly my kin."
我族人的灵魂屏障激活唤醒了我，" 亚当解释道，"有趣。他与我相似，但并非完全是我族人。

"Shinji…" Asuka murmured before raising her volume, "well, where am I? Why did you bring me here?"
真嗣……" 明日香低语后提高音量，"那么，我在哪儿？你为什么把我带到这里来？

"You are my kin as well, and you were dying. I extracted your soul from your body. This is the only way to save you."
你也是我的族人，而且你濒临死亡。我把你灵魂从肉体中抽离出来。这是唯一能救你的方法。

"Well ain't this convenient…" Asuka muttered, "what are you going to do, then?"
哎呀，这可真方便…" 明日香嘀咕道，"那你打算怎么办？

"What am I going to do? Summon my offspring, of course," Adam replied offhandedly, "the world will once again become the playground of the possessors of the fruit of life!"
我打算怎么办？当然是召唤我的后代，" 亚当漫不经心地回答，"世界将再次成为生命之果拥有者的游乐场！

"Wait you can't do that," said Asuka in a stern voice, "I can't allow it!"
等等，你不能那样做，" 明日香语气严肃地说，"我不能允许！

"Why?" Adam furrowed his brows, "do you not wish to meet the others of our species?"
为什么？" 亚当皱起眉头，"难道你不想见到我们同类的其他成员吗？

"My species, is humans, or 'Lilin', not Ang-the possessors of the fruit of life!" Asuka shouted, "and I'm not your 'kin'!"
我的种族，是人类，或者说'莉莉丝'，而非拥有生命之果的安族！" 明日香大声反驳，"而且我可不是你的'同类'！

"Well, too bad, you can't stop me," Adam laughed, "although you and the…creature there possess the fruit of life, your powers are well below mine. You can choose either to follow my will, or get destroyed."
可惜啊，你阻止不了我，" 亚当笑道，"尽管你和那边的…生物都拥有生命之果，但你们的实力远不及我。你可以选择顺从我的意志，或者被毁灭。

"Is that so?" Asuka mused for a moment before a smug smirk appeared on her face, "Adam…the truth behind your wish to summon the Angels…is that you're lonely, aren't you?!"
是吗？" 明日香沉思片刻，随即脸上浮现出一抹得意的笑容，"亚当…你召唤天使背后的真相…是因为你感到孤独，对吧？！

"What would you know about that, you lowly creature?!" Adam barked.
"你这种低等生物懂什么？！" 亚当怒吼道。

"Being lonely? Oh trust me I know that better than anyone," Asuka sneered, "you Ang…highly creatures have such strong soul barriers because you're all lonely! Extreme autism!"
孤独？哦，相信我，我比谁都清楚，" 明日香冷笑道，"你们这些天使...高级生物拥有如此强大的灵魂屏障，就是因为你们都孤独！极端的自闭！

"Shut up!" Adam cried, losing his composure. "I should have just killed you, but I was curious about you and…the boy, curious about your nature. Now it seems you two are just as resentful as Lilin scum! I'll destroy you! All of you!"
闭嘴！" 亚当失控地喊道，"我本该杀了你，但我对你和...那个男孩，对你的本质感到好奇。现在看来，你们俩和那些人类渣滓一样充满怨恨！我要毁灭你们！所有人！

"Speaking of which, what happened between you and Lilith?" Asuka said as she dodged the AT-Field Adam threw at her, "you wouldn't have to be lonely!"
说到这个，你和莉莉丝之间发生了什么？" 明日香一边躲避亚当投来的 AT 力场一边说，"那样你就不必孤独了！

"You know nothing between us! She's just a bitch who didn't know her place!" Adam roared in rage, "Who are you to know what I feel?! Why do you even exist, Lilith-Spawn?!"
你对我们之间一无所知！她不过是个不知天高地厚的贱人！" 亚当怒吼着，"你凭什么了解我的感受？！你这种莉莉丝的后裔，为何存在？！

"I exist because I can," Asuka eventually said after several seconds of pondering, "as long as I live, there will be chances of happiness," Adam began expanding his wings of light as Asuka continued, "I've always thought myself as nothing since no one would look at me after my mother died. I had no reasons to exist if others wouldn't acknowledge me." Asuka started disintegrating as she went on, her voice, however, remained unwavering. She fixed her cold glare at Adam, "this changed however. After I became an EVA pilot, I had a purpose, although it's unhealthy. One good thing EVA brought to me was the bond I had with other people, especially Shinji. I would have never met him if it wasn't for EVA-"
我存在是因为我能存在，" 明日香在沉思几秒后终于说道，"只要我活着，就有幸福的可能，" 随着明日香继续说，亚当开始展开他的光之翼，"我一直认为自己一无是处，因为母亲去世后没人再关注我。如果别人不认可我，我就没有存在的理由。" 明日香的身体开始消散，但她的声音依旧坚定。她冷冷地盯着亚当，"但这一切改变了。成为 EVA 驾驶员后，我有了目的，尽管这并不健康。EVA 带给我的好事之一是我与其他人，特别是与真嗣之间的联系。如果不是因为 EVA，我永远不会遇见他——

"Wait a second, what is an EVA?" Adam stopped his attacks, curiously asking.
"等一下，EVA 是什么？" 亚当停止了攻击，好奇地问道。

"Ah, I forgot to mention," Asuka said as she thought about her fight with Gaghiel in her Unit 02. Her first sortie, with the boy she loved.
"啊，我忘了提，" 明日香说着，回想起她与加吉尔在二号机中的战斗。那是她的首次出击，与她所爱的男孩一起。

"What is this?" Adam raised his eyebrows, "how…was that…Gaghiel?!"
这是什么？" 亚当扬起眉毛，"怎么…那是…加吉尔？！

'Ha, so he could see into my mind, well, it's much more convenient this way. Enjoy the show!' Asuka smirked slyly as she recalled her Angel fights.
'哈，原来他能窥探我的心思，这样倒是方便多了。尽情欣赏这场表演吧！' 明日香狡黠地一笑，回忆起与使徒的战斗。

Israfel. Defeated by synchronized attacks.
伊斯拉斐尔。败于同步攻击之下。

Sandalphon. Defeated by thermal expansion.
桑达尔丰。因热胀而败。

Matariel. Shot through its eyes.
马尔蒂尔。穿眼而亡。

Sahaquiel. Stabbed in the center.
萨哈魁尔。中心被刺穿。

Ireul. Defeated by a keyboard and a laptop.
伊洛尔。被键盘和笔记本电脑击败。

Leliel. Ripped apart by Unit D.
雷里尔。被 D 号机撕裂。

Bardiel. Torn into pieces.
巴迪尔。被撕成碎片。

Zeruel. Destroyed by Unit D.
塞路尔。被 D 号机摧毁。

Arael. Vaporized by proton rifle.
阿拉尔。被质子步枪蒸发。

Armisael. Blown up by self-destructed Unit 02.
阿米萨尔。被自爆的 02 号机炸毁。

At this point Adam was already dripping sweat like raindrops. He basically just witnessed the extermination of all of his offspring at the front row.
此时，亚当已是汗如雨下，他几乎亲眼目睹了自己所有后代的灭绝，如同坐在前排的观众。

Tabris. Carried the soul of Adam. CRUSH.
塔布里斯。承载着亚当的灵魂。粉碎。

It was the last straw. "ENOUGH!" Adam cried shakily, his voice breaking down, "enough of that! I can't take it anymore!"
这成了压垮他的最后一根稻草。"够了！"亚当颤抖着喊道，声音支离破碎，"够了！我再也受不了了！"

"Oh? Did I hear it right? The almighty Adam, the first of the Angels, sounded more scared than anything." Asuka laughed, "pathetic."
哦？我没听错吧？无所不能的亚当，天使中的第一人，听起来比什么都害怕。"明日香嘲笑道，"真可悲。

"I'm leaving this place." Adam muttered in dread, "this isn't a place for me to stay. So scary. Lilin scum…"
我要离开这个地方。"亚当恐惧地低语，"这里不是我该停留的地方。太可怕了。莉莉丝的渣滓……

"Oh, what happened to 'I'll destroy all of you'?" Asuka scoffed, "let me guess-"
哦，那句‘我要毁灭你们所有人’怎么了？"明日香嘲讽道，"让我猜猜——

"Get out! GET OUT!" Adam screamed.
"滚出去！滚出去！"亚当尖叫着。

With a blinding flash of light, Asuka's vision went white.
一道耀眼的光芒闪过，明日香的视野顿时一片空白。

Shinji looked down at the lifeless corpse of the love of his life while people around him were running, trying to escape the white giant that just appeared. He wanted to cry, but tears wouldn't come out. He didn't have anything to say, either. He just stared at her slender body with numb eyes, not so much as blinking.
真嗣低头看着他心爱之人的尸体，周围的人们正四处奔逃，试图逃离刚刚出现的白色巨人。他想哭，但泪水却流不出来。他也没有任何话要说。他只是用麻木的眼神凝视着她纤细的身躯，连眼皮都不曾眨动。

His brain completely shut down, refusing to accept reality.
他的大脑彻底关闭，拒绝接受现实。

Kaji walked over, trying to get to Shinji's side, but was blocked by an invisible wall. Although he wasn't that acquainted with the redhead, he knew perfectly well what it felt to lose someone close to him, not to mention someone he loved. When he and Katsuragi broke up, he was listless for months. "Shinji…" he started, but couldn't find any more words. What could he say? To tell him to move on? "I'm sorry." Eventually he said.
加持走了过来，试图靠近真嗣，却被一道无形的墙挡住。虽然他与那个红发少年并不算熟识，但他完全明白失去亲近之人，尤其是所爱之人的感受。当他与葛城分手时，他曾数月无精打采。“真嗣…”他开口，却再也找不到更多的话语。他能说什么呢？告诉他要向前看吗？“对不起。”最终他说道。

Shinji showed absolutely no sign of him acknowledging his presence whatsoever, continuing to stare at the limp redhead.
真嗣丝毫没有表现出意识到他存在的迹象，依旧凝视着那具毫无生气的红发身躯。

"Shinji, I'm really sorry," Kaji carried on, "it's my fault. I should've realized there would be some people-"
“真嗣，我真的非常抱歉，”加持继续说道，“这是我的错。我本该意识到会有一些人——”

"Kaji-san…is it really worth it to love someone, if it could hurt so much?" Shinji cut him off in an emotionless voice.
"加治先生…如果爱一个人会这么痛苦，那真的值得吗？" 真嗣用毫无感情的声音打断了他。

"Shinji…if there's no pain, then there's no happiness either," Kaji looked up at the ceiling sadly, "as long as you live-"
真嗣…如果没有痛苦，也就没有幸福，" 加治悲伤地抬头望向天花板，"只要你活着——

"But I'm already dead, inside," Shinji interrupted again.
"但我内心已经死了，" 真嗣再次打断他。

"I…get it, Shinji, but I think we should get out of here," Kaji said as the white giant expanded its wings of light, "I think Second Impact is about to happen!"
我…明白了，真嗣，但我觉得我们应该离开这里，" 加治说道，此时那白色巨人展开了它的光之翼，"我想第二次冲击就要发生了！

"I don't care, I want to die with her," Shinji said lightly. He crouched down and put his hand on her face, caressing her cheek that's cooling down. He leaned his face closer to hers.
"我不在乎，我要和她一起死," 真嗣轻声说道。他蹲下身，将手放在她渐渐冷却的脸颊上，轻轻抚摸。他将自己的脸贴近她的。

Can you give me one last kiss?
能给我最后一个吻吗？

Their lips met. 他们的唇相触。

Asuka's eyes shot open, cobalt met bright blue.
明日香的眼睛猛地睁开，钴蓝与明亮的蓝色相遇。

"A-A-A-A-ASUKA?!" Shinji practically jumped to his feet, his eyes wide open.
"啊啊啊啊啊明日香?!" 真嗣几乎是从座位上跳了起来，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Owww…this fucking hurts…" Asuka groaned; the blood around her wounds started flowing backward, and the bullets were repelled out of her body. Her fatal injury began to heal at a visible rate.
"哎哟……真他妈疼……" 明日香呻吟着；她伤口周围的血开始逆流，子弹被排斥出体外。她那致命的伤势以肉眼可见的速度开始愈合。

Shinji watched in shock as Asuka slowly got up to her feet, her wounds completely healed. She shook her head, not believing what happened herself. "I feel…" she looked at her hand and took a swing. An orange octangular barrier flashed in front of her. Asuka grinned in surprise, "Shinji! I think-"
真嗣震惊地看着明日香缓缓站起身来，伤口已完全愈合。她摇了摇头，似乎连自己都不敢相信所发生的一切。"我感觉……" 她看着自己的手挥了一拳，一个橙色的八角形屏障在她面前闪现。明日香惊讶地咧嘴一笑，"真嗣！我想-"

She was cut off by a fierce bear hug as Shinji dashed forward and embraced her. "A-Asuka…thank god…" Tears rolled down his face like a waterfall, "I-I thought I lost you…"
她的话被一个猛烈的熊抱打断了，真嗣冲上前紧紧抱住了她。"明日香……谢天谢地……" 泪水如瀑布般从他脸上滚落，"我……我还以为失去你了……"

Asuka put her arms around him as well, returning the hug just as fiercely, "shh… it's okay, I'm right here. Apparently the Grim Reaper was scared of me and threw me right back!"
明日香也伸出双臂紧紧回抱他，“嘘…没事了，我就在这儿。看来死神也怕了我，直接把我扔回来了！”

"What is that?" Shinji asked, pointing his finger at an ascending figure, its wings of light swinging.
“那是什么？”真嗣指着空中一个逐渐上升的身影问道，那身影的光之翼轻轻摆动。

"It's Adam. I believe it's leaving the earth," Asuka smirked proudly, "I…intimidated him."
“那是亚当。我想它是要离开地球了，”明日香得意地笑了笑，“我…把它吓跑了。”

"Leaving? So…Second Impact won't happen anymore?" Shinji blinked in surprise.
“离开？那…第二次冲击就不会发生了吗？”真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼。

"I suppose not!" Asuka blabbed happily, "see! Adam's gone."
我想也是！"明日香开心地嚷嚷着，"看！亚当不见了。

Just like she said, with a violent swing of its wings of light, Adam shot up to the sky, passing through earth's lower orbit. Its gigantic body looked smaller and smaller as Adam flew further away from the planet, heading into deep space.
正如她所言，亚当猛地挥动光之翼，冲天而起，穿过地球的低轨道。随着亚当远离星球，向深空飞去，它那庞大的身躯在视野中变得越来越小。

Adam fled. 亚当逃走了。

"Yeah, run! Don't ever come back, you coward! I was hoping to crush you again, with my bare hands!" Asuka shouted to the sky, high on the effect of adrenaline.
"对，快跑！别再回来，你这懦夫！我还想亲手再把你碾碎一次呢！"明日香对着天空高声喊道，肾上腺素的作用让她情绪高涨。

Kaji Ryoji watched the whole scene with his mouth agape; it was Shinji's slightly worried voice that dragged him back to reality, "K-Kaji-san?"
加持良治目瞪口呆地目睹了整个场景；是真嗣略带忧虑的声音将他拉回了现实，“加、加持先生？”

The said spy jerked his head in Shinji's direction, "so you two are actually…not human," he muttered.
那位间谍猛地转头看向真嗣，喃喃自语：“原来你们俩竟然……不是人类。”

"Kaji-san…please don't tell anyone else…" Shinji pleaded, "I just got Asuka back, I just want to live a normal life!"
“加持先生……请不要告诉其他人……”真嗣恳求道，“我刚找回明日香，我只想过正常的生活！”

Kaji shook his head, "don't worry, no one outside will ever know about you two. We'll also hunt down SEELE members," he sighed, "as long as you don't do something stupid that may give you away."
加持摇了摇头，“别担心，外面的人永远不会知道你们俩的事。我们还会追捕 SEELE 的成员，”他叹了口气，“只要你们不做些可能暴露自己的蠢事。”

"Sure, it's not like we want other people to know about us. I don't want to get dissected by crazy scientists or some shit," Asuka huffed before turning to the boy beside her, "hey Shinji?"
当然，我们并不希望别人知道我们的存在。我可不想被疯狂的科学家们解剖或者遭遇什么鬼事，" 明日香嘟囔着，转头看向旁边的男孩，"喂，真嗣？

"Hmm?" 嗯？

"Let's go home." 我们回家吧。

Epilogue: 尾声：

Earth Orbit, 2039 A.D. 地球轨道，公元 2039 年

The God Shinji and Asuka came back to the world they were born on after a long trip to the nearby galaxies. They truly had a lot of fun as they visited different cosmic marvels and sights.
神明真嗣与明日香在游历邻近星系后，回到了他们诞生的世界。他们确实在探访各种宇宙奇观和美景中享受了无尽的乐趣。

Today they came back for a specific reason.
今日他们归来，有着特定的原因。

"Let's see how the other us are doing…" the God Asuka said as she descended, "where…ah, there they are!" She pointed her arm in the direction.
“让我们看看另一个我们过得如何……”神明明日香降落时说道，“在哪呢…啊，他们在那儿！”她指向那个方向。

The God Shinji followed the direction and looked, "oh…wait, who's that?" He took a closer look, "THEY'VE ALREADY GOT A KID?!"
神明真嗣顺着方向望去，“哦…等等，那是谁？”他定睛一看，“他们已经有孩子了？！”

The God Asuka smirked proudly, "and it looked I'm doing a good job raising her. I never thought I would be a good mother."
神明明日香得意地笑了笑，“看来我养育得还不错。我从未想过自己会是个好母亲。”

"I'm actually jealous…they are already farther than we are…" the God Shinji sulked.
“其实我有点嫉妒…他们已经走在我们前面了…”神明真嗣闷闷不乐地说。

"You're a Baka, alright," the God Asuka chuckled, "we have much more fun things to do other than raising a child. Don't you think so, eh Baka-Shinji?"
“你真是个笨蛋，”神明明日香咯咯笑道，“除了养孩子，我们还有很多更有趣的事情要做。你不觉得吗，嗯，笨蛋真嗣？”

"I suppose you're right…" the God Shinji smiled warmly as he saw he and the God Asuka's counterparts smiled happily with their child.
"我想你是对的…"神之真嗣微笑着，看到自己和神之明日香的对照面带着幸福的笑容，与他们的孩子一起。

The Gods of the world were happy, all was right in the world.
世界上的众神都感到快乐，一切都在正轨上。

AN: Anti-climactic isn't it? C'mon, this fic isn't labeled 'humor' for nothing. Sorry for the short chapter, but it contained everything I wanted to write for the final scene of the story. The point of this story was never 'drama' or 'adventure', but WAFF AsuShin moments. (In short I'm just lazy hahaha)
作者注：是不是有点反高潮？别急，这篇小说既然标了'幽默'，总得有点料。抱歉章节短了点，但里面包含了我想为故事结局写的一切。这个故事的重点从来不是'戏剧'或'冒险'，而是温馨的 AsuShin 时刻。（简而言之，我就是懒哈哈哈）

Ending a story is always sad, but this also means I can devote all of my time into The One In Your Life. I hope you liked this story! My deepest appreciation to everyone who read, faved, followed, and reviewed. (Bow)
结束一个故事总是令人伤感，但这同时也意味着我可以将所有时间投入到《你生命中的那一位》。希望你喜欢这个故事！对所有阅读、收藏、关注和评论的朋友们，致以我最深的感谢。（鞠躬）
